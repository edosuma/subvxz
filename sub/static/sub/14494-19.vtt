<i>[Fury]
Fury to Iron Man.
We're out of time.</i>

00:06.323 --> 00:08.966
<i>Kang's forces have taken
over 3/4 of the planet,</i>

00:08.967 --> 00:12.228
<i>and for every city we're
holding, four more fall.</i>

00:12.229 --> 00:14.481
<i>[Iron Man]
Are you calling just
to give me a pep talk?</i>

00:14.482 --> 00:16.439
<i>[Fury]
No, I'm calling to tell you</i>

00:16.440 --> 00:18.527
<i>that the base you found
is on the move.</i>

00:18.528 --> 00:21.203
My people are reading
a massive energy build up.

00:21.204 --> 00:23.095
That thing is gonna fire.

00:23.096 --> 00:26.326
And I'm guessing
that when it does,
it's not gonna be pretty.

00:26.327 --> 00:28.219
<i>[Iron Man]
Understood, Fury.
We're on it.</i>

01:27.297 --> 01:29.726
Lord Kang,
the target is locked.

01:29.727 --> 01:31.656
Fire.

02:54.527 --> 02:56.063
How much time do we have?

02:58.034 --> 02:59.870
Gyha! Not enough.

02:59.871 --> 03:01.807
What is it?

03:03.545 --> 03:05.916
[Hawkeye]
It's a targeting beam

03:05.917 --> 03:07.119
like a laser sight.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.689
A really, really big one.

03:08.690 --> 03:10.190
Can you tell where
it's aimed, Stark?

03:10.191 --> 03:12.329
Uh, yeah, at us.

03:12.330 --> 03:14.600
But we're right over the city.

03:14.601 --> 03:16.737
A blast that size
will destroy everything.

03:16.738 --> 03:19.777
I don't think Kang cares
about collateral damage, Pym.

03:19.778 --> 03:22.749
He wants us gone,
no matter who pays the price.

03:22.750 --> 03:24.253
Nay.

03:24.254 --> 03:26.057
[Wasp]
Thor!

03:28.195 --> 03:30.900
Whoa, I've never seen him
fly that fast.

03:30.901 --> 03:32.335
What's he doing?

03:32.336 --> 03:34.139
[Captain America]
He's saving us all.

03:41.822 --> 03:42.957
For Midgard!

04:00.292 --> 04:02.997
He's still falling.
We have to go back.

04:02.998 --> 04:05.302
We can't.
Thor bought us a chance.

04:05.303 --> 04:07.439
We have to keep going
before Kang fires again.

04:07.440 --> 04:11.814
Ant-Man to Ultrons 1 and 4,
break off and catch Thor.

04:18.829 --> 04:20.130
Thor.

04:20.130 --> 04:23.371
Mmm, Goldilocks is tough.

04:23.372 --> 04:24.706
He'll make it.

04:27.413 --> 04:28.815
Say something, Hank.

04:28.816 --> 04:29.850
Is he alive?

04:31.788 --> 04:34.326
The Ultrons have him.
He's comatose, but he's alive.

04:37.768 --> 04:38.969
[Kang]
Report.

04:38.970 --> 04:42.209
[static sounds]

04:42.210 --> 04:44.513
I-- I don't understand.

04:44.514 --> 04:46.750
This era's technology
isn't capable of--

04:46.751 --> 04:49.256
What happened?

04:49.257 --> 04:51.995
Something deflected
the Damocles weapon,

04:51.996 --> 04:55.001
sending it back at us.
The weapon is offline.

04:58.375 --> 05:00.346
[Kang]
The Avengers.

05:00.347 --> 05:03.785
Launch scarabs.
Destroy them.

05:17.914 --> 05:20.853
So this seems like
it's going bad.

05:20.854 --> 05:24.026
Really, I don't want
to backseat drive or anything,

05:24.027 --> 05:25.996
but you might want
to consider shooting back.

05:29.537 --> 05:31.006
Be my guest.

05:32.009 --> 05:33.044
Cool.

05:53.820 --> 05:56.023
Only two Ultrons left.

05:56.024 --> 05:57.960
We're not gonna make it
like this.

05:57.961 --> 06:00.299
Agreed. Take the controls.

06:01.601 --> 06:03.003
Let's go.

06:03.004 --> 06:04.373
You mean Hulk, right?

06:10.286 --> 06:13.157
I cannot believe I'm in space.

06:13.158 --> 06:14.192
Jan.

06:14.193 --> 06:15.996
Jan, focus.

06:15.997 --> 06:17.466
You've got the space armor on.

06:17.467 --> 06:19.269
I designed it to work
with your stingers.

06:19.270 --> 06:21.273
We have to clear a path
for the others.

06:21.274 --> 06:25.115
Let's do this.

06:31.361 --> 06:33.197
Heh, now we're talking.

06:45.957 --> 06:48.027
Yeah, that clenches it.

06:48.028 --> 06:49.630
I'm a good shot with anything.

06:49.631 --> 06:52.369
How about you find us a place
to land this bird, eagle eye?

07:01.020 --> 07:02.957
There, an airlock.

07:04.294 --> 07:05.496
I'm guessing they're not going

07:05.497 --> 07:07.199
to just open the door
for us, though.

07:07.200 --> 07:09.570
Hulk, why don't you knock?

07:21.127 --> 07:24.066
<i>[Captain America]
Iron Man, Wasp,
we're going in.</i>

07:38.229 --> 07:40.232
Hey.
Guys, we're cut off.

07:40.233 --> 07:42.303
A force field
sealed the breach.

07:42.304 --> 07:44.140
<i>[Ant-Man]
Hang on, we'll find
a way to open it.</i>

07:44.141 --> 07:45.542
No, stick with the plan.

07:45.543 --> 07:46.745
We'll find another way in.

07:46.746 --> 07:48.080
We will?

07:48.081 --> 07:49.317
I don't know.

07:49.318 --> 07:50.786
I'm just making this up
as I go along.

07:50.787 --> 07:52.356
We've got incoming.

07:52.357 --> 07:53.592
Nuts.

07:55.229 --> 07:57.700
That was fun.

08:06.084 --> 08:07.319
[Ant-Man]
Okay, so what now?

08:07.320 --> 08:08.656
We take down Kang.

08:08.657 --> 08:10.292
That's right, I forgot.

08:10.293 --> 08:11.629
Violence first.

08:20.346 --> 08:25.155
Kang the Conqueror
welcomes you to Damocles Base.

08:27.227 --> 08:29.497
It will be your tomb.

08:34.727 --> 08:38.163
<i>[Ultron]

<i>This behavior

08:49.812 --> 08:52.282
Hulk--

08:52.283 --> 08:55.019
smash?

08:59.091 --> 09:00.026
Hulk--

10:07.046 --> 10:10.516
The primate is trying
to hit us with sticks.

10:10.517 --> 10:13.086
Actually,
I was trying to do this.

10:31.211 --> 10:32.412
I could try my uni-beam.

10:32.413 --> 10:35.215
Or, we could pretend
to be Girl Scouts?

10:35.216 --> 10:37.785
Everyone opens the door
for Girl Scouts.

10:37.786 --> 10:38.987
You're not helping, Jan.

10:40.823 --> 10:44.093
Okay, you want help? Fine.

10:44.094 --> 10:45.562
Jan?
Jan!

10:50.502 --> 10:51.904
Hi.

10:51.905 --> 10:54.841
Great, on top
of everything else

10:54.842 --> 10:56.810
I have to deal
with Wasp going nuts.

10:56.811 --> 10:58.412
Incoming!

11:08.393 --> 11:10.360
Wow, that was--

11:10.361 --> 11:12.564
Come on.

11:14.433 --> 11:16.502
Multiple breaches reported.

11:16.503 --> 11:19.606
The elite guard
is not responding
from the airlock breach and--

11:19.607 --> 11:21.007
[alarm sounds]
Alert.

11:21.008 --> 11:23.344
Another intruder alarm.
Deck 72.

11:23.345 --> 11:27.015
I want confirmation, now!

11:27.016 --> 11:28.852
Yes, sir. Alert.

11:28.853 --> 11:31.521
The Armada ships stationed
in what was known as Wakanda,

11:31.522 --> 11:33.591
Their time drives
have been destroyed.

11:33.592 --> 11:35.460
All ships stationed there
are gone.

11:35.461 --> 11:40.600
I will not be beaten
by a bunch of Neanderthals.

11:40.601 --> 11:43.170
Hold the line!

11:45.274 --> 11:46.908
[Captain America]
Let's move.

11:46.909 --> 11:48.343
We have to find Kang.

11:48.344 --> 11:51.213
Wait, if we find
the station's time drive,

11:51.214 --> 11:52.649
we can end all of this
right now.

11:52.650 --> 11:55.051
We destroy that,
and this whole base,

11:55.052 --> 11:57.555
Kang included, disappear.
The war is over.

11:57.556 --> 12:00.058
Okay, but how do we find it?

12:00.059 --> 12:02.629
Ultron 5,
scan for tachyon particles.

12:02.630 --> 12:04.998
The other drives were
giving them off big time.

12:09.071 --> 12:11.373
<i>Tachyon source detected.</i>

12:11.374 --> 12:15.411
<i>Locating.</i>

12:15.412 --> 12:17.447
Huh, useful toy.

12:17.448 --> 12:19.150
Creepy-looking, though.

12:19.151 --> 12:20.985
It's a not a toy,
and it's not creepy.

12:20.986 --> 12:23.656
It's designed to look
like an ant's head.

12:25.692 --> 12:27.394
Whatever you say, Pym.

12:29.498 --> 12:32.166
<i>[Iron Man]
You know, we were suppose
to stay together.</i>

12:32.167 --> 12:34.169
I'm scouting,
and you're too big.

12:34.170 --> 12:36.072
And, quite frankly, too slow.

12:36.073 --> 12:38.207
I'm going to find Kang.

12:42.715 --> 12:45.383
Uh, hi.

12:48.155 --> 12:49.356
Are you okay?

12:49.357 --> 12:52.159
Princess Ravonna is dying.

12:52.160 --> 12:55.463
A victim of the destruction
of her timeline.

12:55.464 --> 12:57.499
She is not okay.

12:57.500 --> 12:59.669
And neither are you.

13:05.110 --> 13:07.613
This is it.

13:07.614 --> 13:09.014
Big.

13:09.015 --> 13:10.383
I don't care how big it is.

13:10.384 --> 13:12.218
It's getting smashed.

13:50.803 --> 13:52.637
We need a plan.

13:52.638 --> 13:55.207
We can't get past
the time drive shield.

13:55.208 --> 13:56.308
So what now?

13:59.614 --> 14:02.350
Hank!

14:02.351 --> 14:04.386
Ant-Man, we need you.

14:04.387 --> 14:06.221
Ant-Man?

14:06.222 --> 14:08.091
He's out. Cap, come on.

14:08.092 --> 14:10.761
We need to shut down
the computer systems.

14:10.762 --> 14:12.563
Maybe we can reprogram
the thing.

14:15.668 --> 14:17.103
Dr. Pym!

14:22.310 --> 14:25.113
[Kang]
Enough.

14:31.823 --> 14:35.526
You came to fight me, Avengers?

14:35.527 --> 14:39.331
Here I am.

14:41.927 --> 14:43.662
Hey, you know what?

14:43.663 --> 14:46.968
I'm glad Cap's gonna wipe out
your timeline,

14:46.969 --> 14:50.072
because any future
ruled by you has to stink.

15:26.028 --> 15:28.832
Captain America.

15:28.833 --> 15:32.805
You and your teammates have
fought well, Steven Rogers.

15:32.806 --> 15:37.212
But this outcome
was never in question.

15:37.213 --> 15:42.721
I will do whatever it takes
to ensure the survival
of my timeline.

15:42.722 --> 15:46.560
The survival of humanity.

15:46.561 --> 15:49.932
We want the same thing, Kang.

15:49.933 --> 15:52.602
We can work together
to make sure that happens.

15:52.603 --> 15:56.475
No, you are part
of the problem,

15:56.476 --> 15:58.512
not the solution.

16:02.152 --> 16:05.489
Conquest is the solution.

16:05.490 --> 16:08.260
I've heard all this before,
you know?

16:08.261 --> 16:11.732
You're not the first
would-be conqueror I've fought.

16:13.069 --> 16:17.908
I will be the last,
however, Captain.

16:17.909 --> 16:20.112
Though I do enjoy the irony

16:20.113 --> 16:22.748
that you, a man out of time,

16:22.749 --> 16:27.090
thinks he can beat
the master of time.

16:27.091 --> 16:29.827
I don't think
I can beat you, Kang.

16:29.828 --> 16:32.497
I think Iron Man can.

16:33.934 --> 16:35.770
It's over, Kang.

16:35.771 --> 16:37.605
Please, you are no--

16:47.721 --> 16:49.024
How did you--

16:49.025 --> 16:51.194
My tech may not be
as advanced as yours, Kang,

16:51.195 --> 16:53.263
but I'm a quick study.

17:01.143 --> 17:03.713
There's some kind of shield
around the time device.

17:03.714 --> 17:06.083
If we can take that down,
we can destroy it.

17:06.084 --> 17:09.221
No, we're not going
to destroy the time drive.

17:09.222 --> 17:12.861
We're going to use it.

17:12.862 --> 17:16.098
Ultron, prepare to download
a data stream.

17:16.099 --> 17:18.068
<i>Receiving data.</i>

17:18.069 --> 17:20.105
This is everything I've
learned about your tech,

17:20.106 --> 17:22.342
including how to access
your computer systems.

17:22.343 --> 17:24.176
You fool.

17:24.178 --> 17:28.351
You think one of your robots
can control my station?

17:28.352 --> 17:29.720
Uh, yeah.

17:32.058 --> 17:34.961
<i>Accessing Damocles Base
computer systems.</i>

17:34.962 --> 17:37.598
Ultron's A.I. is based
on the human mind.

17:37.599 --> 17:40.771
It can adapt to your systems
faster than anything I got.

17:40.772 --> 17:43.174
And I'm betting
anything you've got.

17:43.175 --> 17:45.945
<i>Damocles attempting lock-out.</i>

17:45.946 --> 17:47.014
<i>Overriding.</i>

17:49.084 --> 17:53.123
<i>Override successful.</i>

17:59.266 --> 18:03.639
You wish to fight me?
Then so be it.

18:46.774 --> 18:48.709
<i>Attention. Kang's fleet
and Damocles Base</i>

18:48.710 --> 18:50.178
<i>are now ready
for chronal travel.</i>

18:50.179 --> 18:51.213
No!
Do it.

19:05.736 --> 19:07.271
Ultron, report.

19:07.272 --> 19:09.808
<i>Preparing to jump
Damocles Base</i>

19:09.809 --> 19:12.813
<i>in 5, 4, 3--</i>

19:12.814 --> 19:13.847
[Wasp]
Stop.

19:17.020 --> 19:18.321
Wasp?

19:18.322 --> 19:20.225
You can't destroy
the time drive

19:20.226 --> 19:22.461
or jump the ship
or whatever
we planned on doing.

19:22.462 --> 19:23.798
Why not?

19:23.799 --> 19:25.132
Because if we do,

19:25.133 --> 19:26.802
Princess Ravonna will die.

19:26.803 --> 19:29.071
Who is Princess Ravonna?

19:29.072 --> 19:31.108
Shoot her. Do it!

19:33.213 --> 19:35.481
Rovanna is the woman
Kang loves.

19:35.482 --> 19:38.754
When his future got wiped out,
she got caught in it.

19:38.755 --> 19:40.824
they're keeping her alive,
but barely.

19:40.825 --> 19:44.295
If Damocles Base travels
back to the future,

19:44.296 --> 19:46.232
she'll be erased
from existence.

19:46.233 --> 19:49.837
Kang, we can stop this.

19:49.838 --> 19:53.210
We can find a way
to save Ravonna.

19:53.211 --> 19:56.414
But we're not going to let you
destroy our world to do it.

19:56.415 --> 19:59.252
This is your last chance.
Surrender.

20:00.889 --> 20:01.990
Never!

20:01.991 --> 20:03.492
Ultron.

20:09.535 --> 20:11.838
Ultron, stand down.
Kang's done.

20:11.839 --> 20:13.242
It's over.

21:10.229 --> 21:12.499
[Iron Man]
I just wanted to thank you, Cap.

21:12.500 --> 21:15.304
You really stepped up
when I needed help,

21:15.305 --> 21:17.507
even after all the grief
I gave you.

21:17.508 --> 21:21.179
I pride myself
on my intelligence,
on my tech,

21:21.180 --> 21:23.115
I think of myself
as a futurist.

21:23.116 --> 21:27.321
But to someone like Kang,
I'm living in the past.

21:27.322 --> 21:28.424
Just like you.

21:28.425 --> 21:30.394
The past isn't so bad.

21:30.395 --> 21:33.465
But the future-- that's
what we're fighting for.

21:33.466 --> 21:35.601
[Kang]
You've destroyed everything.

21:35.602 --> 21:38.006
Is that so?

21:38.007 --> 21:42.445
Oh, yes. I know,
because I've seen

21:42.446 --> 21:44.650
what Captain America's
actions have wrought.

21:46.920 --> 21:51.026
His betrayal
is just the beginning.

21:51.027 --> 21:53.630
The worst is yet to come.
