00:00.110 --> 00:01.410
Previously on brothers & sisters...

00:01.420 --> 00:03.280
Your girl's healthy.She's doing really well.

00:03.290 --> 00:04.430
Just the girl?

00:04.440 --> 00:06.530
We've been having some grown-up problems.

00:06.540 --> 00:09.070
Did daddy do something bad?

00:09.080 --> 00:12.400
You're a soldier,and you have a job to do.
Your unit needs a good medic.

00:12.410 --> 00:14.960
When you're over there,they are
your brothers and sisters.

00:14.970 --> 00:17.540
Did something bad happen to you in chicago?

00:17.550 --> 00:21.150
You have to admit,robert mccallister and his ilk,
kinda what's wrong with this country.

00:21.166 --> 00:26.270
She fixed you up with my brother unbeknownst to
both of us,and apparently it did not go well.

00:26.284 --> 00:29.142
William spiked a fever,
and he's gone into septic shock.

00:29.150 --> 00:31.448
His organs are failing.
He doesn't have much time.

00:31.450 --> 00:33.062
Oh,god.

00:33.079 --> 00:36.443
I can't accept your proposal
until you accept mine.

00:38.027 --> 00:39.373
Yes.

00:45.238 --> 00:47.201
What about that one?

00:47.598 --> 00:49.183
Nah.

00:49.196 --> 00:51.681
What about,uh,this right here?
Looks good.Hey.

00:51.695 --> 00:53.301
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:55.135 --> 00:57.690
Bro,I'm a recovering addict
who's going to iraq in ten days.

00:57.707 --> 00:58.933
That's my point exactly.

00:58.945 --> 01:04.522
A military man going off to war,
you could get some serious sympathy action.

01:05.606 --> 01:08.883
You know,the last time I went surfing,
dad was alive,and kitty was in new york.

01:08.898 --> 01:09.731
Yeah.

01:09.748 --> 01:11.842
It's been a long,complicated year.

01:11.857 --> 01:14.401
You know,but we've had some good times.

01:14.418 --> 01:16.363
It's been a barrel of laughs.

01:17.228 --> 01:19.160
How's julia?

01:20.667 --> 01:22.460
She's fine...

01:22.825 --> 01:25.330
Tired,but she's fine.

01:27.018 --> 01:32.473
Well,here we are again,little brother,
and the waves are breakin'.

01:33.055 --> 01:36.523
It's like what they say--
life is what happens inetween big sets.

01:36.538 --> 01:37.513
Who says that?

01:37.527 --> 01:40.252
I have no idea,
but it sounded pretty poetic in my head.

01:40.266 --> 01:42.472
- You are such a tool.
- Let's go.

01:42.485 --> 01:44.821
I could beat you,asshat.

01:51.026 --> 01:53.002
Wow,that's a rock.

01:53.015 --> 01:55.292
Sorry,I don't mean to stare,
it's just bea--it's beautiful.

01:55.308 --> 01:57.091
Come on,everybody's staring.

01:57.105 --> 01:58.790
This is the meet the ring dinner.

01:58.808 --> 02:00.083
It was my grandmother's.

02:00.098 --> 02:02.581
- She left it to me.
- Wait,so when's the engagement party?

02:02.598 --> 02:05.532
- Yes!
- When is the engagement party?

02:05.546 --> 02:08.062
Well,you know,
it's just a--it's a really busy time,

02:08.078 --> 02:09.771
- so I just,I don't know-
- she decided she didn't want one.

02:09.787 --> 02:12.270
I didn't decide that I didn't want one.
I don't know.

02:12.288 --> 02:15.453
I'm just not comfortable with every--I don't know.

02:15.466 --> 02:20.100
Kitty,if you're holding back on account of julia
and me,don't,honestly,'cause we're fine.

02:20.118 --> 02:22.510
Oh,I-I know.I know,and--and thanks.

02:22.528 --> 02:27.141
You guys are being really great,
but I really,really don't want one.

02:27.157 --> 02:30.482
Kitty,you have to stop taking responsibility
for everyone else's feelings.

02:30.498 --> 02:34.851
We're perfectly capable of taking care of
ourselves,and we want a party.

02:34.867 --> 02:36.612
I don't want to have a party without justin.

02:36.627 --> 02:40.691
Well,he doesn't leave for ten days.
I could throw a wedding in that time.

02:40.706 --> 02:41.950
We--we could have it next weekend.

02:41.966 --> 02:43.310
- No.
- Yes.

02:43.328 --> 02:44.400
- Wait,wait.
- What?

02:44.417 --> 02:45.362
- Do you hear that?
- What?

02:45.377 --> 02:47.783
- No.
- Party...

02:47.795 --> 02:49.472
- No,I'm serious.
- Party!

02:49.488 --> 02:51.292
- Party!Party!
- No,stop!

02:51.307 --> 02:52.941
- Abs-
- party!

02:52.955 --> 02:55.482
Party!Party!

02:55.498 --> 02:57.022
Hey,honey.

02:58.506 --> 03:00.631
Oh,sorry.I,uh...

03:00.647 --> 03:02.633
I didn't know you were asleep.

03:03.168 --> 03:05.440
I didn't mean to be.

03:06.338 --> 03:07.702
It's 8:45?

03:07.717 --> 03:10.423
So,uh,how did it go tonight?

03:10.435 --> 03:13.863
I didn't get very far on the nursery,
if that's what you mean.

03:13.875 --> 03:17.562
Why don't we call my mom and ask her to help
with the nursery,all right?

03:17.575 --> 03:20.293
I mean,she would be more than happy too that.

03:20.307 --> 03:22.193
- You think so?
- Are you kidding me?

03:22.205 --> 03:25.101
I mean,she lives for that kind of stuff.

03:26.298 --> 03:28.742
I'm sorry,tommy.I'm trying.

03:28.758 --> 03:32.010
- I'm really trying.
- Honey,don't apologize.

03:32.028 --> 03:36.322
Just save your energy for when the baby gets home,okay?

03:36.338 --> 03:39.302
I just want her room to be pretty.

03:40.178 --> 03:44.190
It will be.I promise.

03:50.958 --> 03:52.212
I'm sorry.I'm sorry.

03:52.226 --> 03:58.140
It's just the--you know,the mattress is so squishy
th all the blood is rushing to my head.

03:58.158 --> 04:00.970
That's funny,'cause I'm not having that problem.

04:02.538 --> 04:05.242
You know,when you move in...

04:05.257 --> 04:08.563
You can bring any mattress you want.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.633
Oh,my god.Oh,my god.Robert,I'm moving in.

04:12.645 --> 04:15.540
You didn't think I was gonna move
in with you and nora,did you?

04:15.558 --> 04:19.973
Well,no.No,but I-- I just didn't do the math.

04:19.988 --> 04:22.472
Oh,god.Oh,my god.

04:22.486 --> 04:25.781
How am I gonna tell my mother that I'm moving out?

04:27.000 --> 04:33.074

04:36.387 --> 04:38.702
- Justin walker?
- Yeah.Who's this?

04:38.715 --> 04:42.112
This is sergeant harrell from the
department of combat medic training.

04:42.128 --> 04:46.493
I'm calling to confirm your arrival here
at fort jackson on sunday,may 20th.

04:46.508 --> 04:49.501
Wait,sunday?This sunday?

04:49.517 --> 04:55.222
Uh,according to our files,you are
to report for duty on the 20th at 0800.

04:55.237 --> 04:57.001
Well,look,there's gotta be some sorof mistake.

04:57.016 --> 04:59.012
The notice says I don'report to
boot camp till tuesday.

04:59.025 --> 05:00.621
I have the orders right in front of me.

05:00.638 --> 05:02.600
I'm--I'm very sorry.
I can't be there on sunday.

05:02.615 --> 05:05.630
- I have a very important family event to go to on saturday that-
- corporal walker.

05:05.646 --> 05:07.411
Look,seriously,you don't know my mother,okay?

05:07.426 --> 05:09.812
She's gonna kill me,you and the whole army.

05:09.825 --> 05:14.112
You are legally bound to appear on the 20th.

05:14.127 --> 05:18.183

05:35.158 --> 05:36.461
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

05:36.476 --> 05:37.952
Have you seen this list?

05:37.968 --> 05:41.880
Your darling fiance has decided to invite
the entire state of california.

05:41.897 --> 05:46.313
Honey,I really don't think he should be using
his engagement party as a way to get votes.

05:46.327 --> 05:50.051
Mom,he's only inviting his family.

05:50.065 --> 05:53.473
Were the mccallisters part of a breeding experiment?

05:53.488 --> 05:57.023
Listen to this-- major wiener.

05:57.566 --> 06:00.051
- Is that a joke?
- No,don't--don't laugh.

06:00.068 --> 06:03.813
It's robert's favorite uncle,
and it's pronounced winer.

06:03.828 --> 06:06.221
Major wiener?I don't know which one is worse.

06:06.235 --> 06:11.742
You know,mom,you and i really need to discuss
what's gonna happen next you know,withou and me.

06:11.757 --> 06:13.580
Yes.Yes,yes,and i really want to do that,

06:13.598 --> 06:17.350
but I think right now,honey,
we have to focus on the task at hand.

06:17.367 --> 06:20.711
We're gonna have to call all these people.
We don't have time to send out invitations.

06:20.725 --> 06:22.823
I'm gonna need a lot of numbers
from the senator's office.

06:22.837 --> 06:26.653
Mom,you can call him robert now,not senator...
Because we're getting married.

06:26.665 --> 06:29.921
We're--we're merging our lives.

06:29.936 --> 06:31.860
Hey,kitty.Hey,nora.

06:31.877 --> 06:35.222
Sorry,i'll be out of your way in a second.
I'm just getting something to drink.

06:35.235 --> 06:36.300
Actually,I wanted to talk to you.

06:36.316 --> 06:40.370
I want you to invite your mother
to kitty's engagement party.

06:40.386 --> 06:42.461
Oh,I-I don't--I don't know if that's a good idea.

06:42.475 --> 06:44.840
She--I don't think--I don't
know if she'd want to go.

06:44.855 --> 06:47.112
I don't think you heard me.
You're part of this family.

06:47.128 --> 06:52.011
She's your mother.She's in business
with my son.Invite her.

06:52.425 --> 06:55.511
- Will do.
- Okay,good.Thanks.

06:57.877 --> 06:59.663
Mom?Mom,do you remember the vineyard?

06:59.677 --> 07:01.972
I don't want another pastry smackdown.

07:01.986 --> 07:04.160
Oh,that tension is all settled now.

07:04.176 --> 07:07.422
Well,for the record,I really
want this marriage to happen.

07:07.435 --> 07:09.813
Kitty,you're getting married.

07:09.828 --> 07:11.853
Do you know how long i've been dreaming of this?

07:11.866 --> 07:15.741
And here we are,mother and daughter,under the same
roof,planning for the most important--

07:15.756 --> 07:20.691
- About that one roof...
- Roof?

07:20.706 --> 07:23.450
We have to find a venue.Sweet mother of god!

07:23.468 --> 07:25.170
How could i have forgotten that?

07:25.184 --> 07:26.972
I just couldn't tell her.

07:26.981 --> 07:28.798
I mean,she's just got so much to deal with right now.

07:28.860 --> 07:31.132
I mean,justin's going to iraq,for god sake.

07:31.149 --> 07:34.062
I wouldn't worry about it.
Uh,I think the right moment will present itself.

07:34.075 --> 07:36.200
Ten-hut!Oh,sorry.

07:36.216 --> 07:37.980
I forgot that I'm no longer in the military.

07:37.996 --> 07:40.301
I was just calming your fiancee down.

07:40.318 --> 07:42.972
I know.I couldn't tell her.She--she's overwhelmed.

07:42.988 --> 07:45.772
Hey,jace,why don't you help nora
out with the party?

07:45.787 --> 07:49.783
And the connection would be,what,
gay pers,brilliant party planner?

07:49.797 --> 07:53.541
- Tell me I'm wrong.
- No.No,and I'm glad to be of service.

07:54.596 --> 07:56.220
How come I didn't get a nice brother like that?

07:56.235 --> 07:58.351
How come I got stuck with larry,moe and curly?

07:58.367 --> 08:01.141
- Don't forget,he's already met moe.
- Yeah.Sorry.

08:01.156 --> 08:03.690
I don't know what I was thinking,
fixing you two up.

08:03.708 --> 08:06.561
Oh,I'm sure I just caught kevin on a bad day.

08:06.575 --> 08:09.812
No.No,he's always like that.

08:10.278 --> 08:14.880
Anyway,at least I'm marrying into
a very nice,normal family,right?

08:16.198 --> 08:19.800
I knew it.You're bogged down in a
quagmire of nora overcommitment.

08:19.816 --> 08:24.172
You know what?I told you so is so ungracious,
and yes,I am feeling a bit overwhelmed.

08:24.185 --> 08:26.133
So please just go look at the venue.

08:26.148 --> 08:28.830
It's downtown,it's colorful,it's renaissancey.

08:28.845 --> 08:30.942
- Renaissancey?
- You know what?

08:30.955 --> 08:33.652
Don't forget,be at my house by 6:00.

08:33.667 --> 08:36.322
Saul is leading a cold call session
to all the guests.

08:36.337 --> 08:39.250
I can't come tonight.
I'm gonna see wicked with justin.

08:39.265 --> 08:42.663
You're gonna see wicked for the
fifth time...With justin?

08:42.677 --> 08:47.532
Sixth time,actually,and I know he hates musicals,
but after wicked,everything will change.

08:47.548 --> 08:51.422
Guess what?I didn't even have to ask him.
He askede.How about that?

08:52.235 --> 08:53.671
Very interesting.

08:53.687 --> 08:55.490
So I asked him to go see wicked.Big deal.

08:55.508 --> 09:00.043
I mean,he's been going on and on about this
forever like it's the second coming or something.

09:00.058 --> 09:03.451
But you hate musical you walked out of sound of music
when you were 5.

09:03.465 --> 09:05.141
You know what?I've talked to the others.

09:05.155 --> 09:08.463
You took tommy surfing the other day.
You took sarah and the kids to the zoo.

09:08.475 --> 09:10.513
You--you've asked me to go to the museum tomorrow.

09:10.525 --> 09:13.023
What are you gonna do with kitty,
take her to the reagan library?

09:13.038 --> 09:15.660
Why are you busting my chops,mom?

09:15.675 --> 09:17.190
Because I know what you're doing.

09:17.208 --> 09:21.281
I'm not doing anything,okay?
I'm saying good-bye to my family,because I may...

09:21.298 --> 09:24.943
What?Finish the sentence.

09:24.956 --> 09:28.260
Because I'm going to iraq,mom.

09:28.976 --> 09:30.530
That's not what you're thinking.

09:30.546 --> 09:33.323
Ma,you don't know what
I'm thinking or what I'm feeling,okay?

09:33.335 --> 09:37.221
Well,you know what?I'm not gonna go
to the museum with you tomorrow.

09:37.237 --> 09:38.420
We'll go when you get back.

09:38.436 --> 09:41.731
But,ma,you wanted to see the hockney exhibit.
It's notonna be there anymore.

09:41.746 --> 09:44.361
What--you know what?Life's not permanent,
and you of all people should know this.

09:44.378 --> 09:48.210
So please don't be telling me
that I can't say good-bye to my family.

09:48.227 --> 09:52.510
That's not what you mean when
you say it,and I won't stand for it.

09:52.525 --> 09:56.623
Mom,I'm going to a place where--
where people are getting blown up on a daily basis,okay?

09:56.637 --> 09:58.562
There's a very real possibility
that I'm not gonna come back--

09:58.575 --> 10:01.850
Stop.stop!

10:01.866 --> 10:06.363
If you go there believing something's
going to happen to you,then something's
going to happen to you.

10:06.378 --> 10:08.982
What do you want me to do,pretend I'm invincible?

10:08.995 --> 10:14.782
I want you to know as deeply and
surely as I do that you are coming home,

10:14.798 --> 10:18.931
and that is the only thought
you should have in your head.

10:19.976 --> 10:22.050
I don't know that,mom.

10:22.067 --> 10:25.981
Justin,you told me how you talk to
the soldiers on the battlefield,

10:25.997 --> 10:30.003
that you look in their eyes,and you promise them
that they're going to live.

10:30.015 --> 10:34.991
Why can't you give yourself the
same benefit of the doubt?Why?

10:35.465 --> 10:38.740
Because I was lying,mom.

10:40.038 --> 10:43.013
Not all of 'em made it.

10:43.537 --> 10:44.843
So,mom,you can think whatever you want,

10:44.856 --> 10:50.262
but please do not tell me that
I can't take my mother to a museum to say good-bye,okay?

10:50.747 --> 10:53.433
No.I'm not gonna go.

10:54.006 --> 10:57.042
I won't say good-bye.

11:06.495 --> 11:09.530
The bougainvillea court can hold up
to 200 people comfortably.

11:09.546 --> 11:11.512
Yeah,it's definitely colorful...

11:11.526 --> 11:14.201
Like the bougainvillea,it's bright and pink.

11:14.218 --> 11:16.571
You know what?It's just a little antacid pink.

11:16.585 --> 11:20.140
Well,your mother absolutely fell
in love with it on our virtual tour.

11:20.156 --> 11:24.403
Really?Does,uh,does the virtual tour
include a picture of the carpet?

11:24.418 --> 11:27.232
Do you have a problem with my room?

11:27.247 --> 11:30.152
It's not necessarily my taste.

11:30.168 --> 11:32.930
Maybe you have bad taste.

11:32.947 --> 11:34.631
You know what?If you're gonna insult me,
I can leave.

11:34.645 --> 11:36.391
It's absolutely no problem for me.

11:36.508 --> 11:39.401
Okay,what's the problem this time,kevin?

11:39.415 --> 11:43.651
N-no,he--he thinks I have bad taste.
Um,what are you doing here?

11:43.666 --> 11:48.702
Well,I was told I'd be meeting your mother
,but,uh,looks like both sides sent the gay
scouts instead,huh?

11:48.718 --> 11:50.640
Excuse me,gentlemen.I hate to interrupt--

11:50.656 --> 11:51.620
you know what?I'm sorry.

11:51.637 --> 11:55.112
This--this is not what I had in mind
for my sister's engagement party.

11:55.128 --> 11:58.672
The bougainvillea court is famous
for its character and texture.

11:58.685 --> 12:02.331
If by character and texture you mean cockroaches
and columns,then yeah,you're really on the money.

12:02.345 --> 12:04.633
- Kevin.
- Oh,come on.You hate this as much as I do.

12:04.647 --> 12:09.520
It's like the first 15 minutes of extreme
home makeover before they tear the house down.

12:09.537 --> 12:12.382
Consider your contract null and void.

12:14.977 --> 12:18.080
Great,genius.Now what?

12:18.098 --> 12:20.711
Are you still trying to sabotage
this relationship?

12:20.728 --> 12:24.541
No,not--no,I just wasn't feeling--
look,I'm a lawyer.I'll get your deposit back.

12:24.555 --> 12:27.501
I want you to call the man and
beg him to let us have that room.

12:27.518 --> 12:28.832
- No.
- It's perfect.

12:28.848 --> 12:30.563
Mom,I'm not calling that person.Wait a minute.

12:30.575 --> 12:35.241
Will you--wait--okay,we found the perfect
place,and it's free,

12:35.255 --> 12:39.373
it's available,and it's very homey.

12:40.826 --> 12:44.050
Oh,no,no,no.We are not doing it here.

12:44.066 --> 12:46.151
Why not?We've had such amazing times he.

12:46.165 --> 12:49.490
- Look,it's-- it'll be meaningful,intimate-
- intimate?

12:49.508 --> 12:51.731
- We have a hundred guests coming!
- 150

12:51.745 --> 12:53.713
I just got the senator's updated list.

12:53.725 --> 12:55.163
Which is why we've rented a tent.

12:55.176 --> 12:57.720
Do you know what a tent will do to my grass?

12:57.736 --> 13:01.010
And we'll have to rent tables and chairs
and plates-- you're not using my dishes.

13:01.028 --> 13:04.982
We've taken care of everything,okay?
We've just hired a valet and confirmed a caterer.

13:04.995 --> 13:06.621
Who is this we we're talking about?

13:06.637 --> 13:10.073
Jason mccallister and I,my future...
Whatever-in-law.

13:10.088 --> 13:11.392
- That's the senator's brother?
- Yeah.

13:11.407 --> 13:13.060
He hates you.

13:13.075 --> 13:15.211
- He doesn't hate me.
- Oh,no,he hates you.

13:15.226 --> 13:19.182
He does not hate me.
It's a secret crush turned...Inside out.

13:19.196 --> 13:23.783
Anyway,we both share the gay party planning gene,
so all you have to do is relax.

13:23.798 --> 13:24.813
All right.

13:24.828 --> 13:28.643
Saul,I forgot to tell you--
milo peterman's coming.

13:28.658 --> 13:29.820
- He is?
- Yeah.

13:29.835 --> 13:32.653
He called me the other day out of the blue.
He asked about you.He asked about the kids.

13:32.665 --> 13:34.721
I told him I didn't have time to explain...

13:34.738 --> 13:36.762
And why didn't he just come and
find out for himself?

13:36.778 --> 13:38.653
Nora,he does not belong at this party.

13:38.668 --> 13:41.120
- Who's milo peterman?
- He's an old friend of saul's.

13:41.138 --> 13:43.242
Why?What's one more at this point?

13:43.255 --> 13:45.731
Two more if he brings that bitch wife elaine well,

13:45.748 --> 13:48.892
he's not bringing elaine.They got a divorce.

13:48.908 --> 13:50.981
- They did?
- Yes.

13:51.556 --> 13:53.213
- Hi.
- Hey.
- Hi.

13:53.226 --> 13:58.070
So,mom,i've decided that
I don't think I should be the primary toaster.

13:58.336 --> 14:01.801
No,come on.I'm always the one talking,
and quite frankly,I'm sick of me.

14:01.816 --> 14:04.043
Let's give someone else a chance.

14:04.056 --> 14:05.982
- There's a new one.
- Oh,shut up,dirt bag.

14:05.996 --> 14:08.153
You speak beautifully.

14:08.168 --> 14:10.893
But,mom,it's a little weird,isn't it,

14:10.906 --> 14:14.463
me giving a toast about marriage given
my current situation?

14:14.477 --> 14:17.253
It just--you know,it feels like bad luck.

14:17.268 --> 14:19.272
- Hey,guys.
- Pizza!

14:19.288 --> 14:21.780
Hey,mom,julia is not coming to the party.

14:21.796 --> 14:27.330
All right!I want you all to leave
until you have something positive to tell me!

14:27.346 --> 14:28.921
Uh,we're going to see wicked.

14:29.708 --> 14:31.280
It's not enough you're going to iraq?

14:31.295 --> 14:33.251
- You're next,tommy.
- Yeah.No.

14:33.265 --> 14:35.411
- Bye,all.
- Bye.

14:35.426 --> 14:38.272
Oh,tommy,can't you convince julia to come?
You could encourage her.

14:38.285 --> 14:40.960
I think it would be od for her to
get out and be with family.

14:40.975 --> 14:43.272
- Mom,just back off.
- All right,okay,I'm backing off.

14:43.285 --> 14:45.132
Hey.So my mom's a yes.

14:45.146 --> 14:46.351
Holly's coming?

14:46.367 --> 14:48.770
Sarah,get over it.We've all moved on.

14:48.787 --> 14:52.861
Well,that's easy for you to say,mom.
I haven't had the chance to hurl food at her.

14:52.875 --> 14:56.413
- No offense,rebecca.
- None taken.Hey,saul.

14:56.427 --> 15:00.541
I just don't see why I should have to see
her at my sister's engagement party.

15:00.557 --> 15:03.903
If it means that much to you,sarah,you'd make the speech.

15:03.915 --> 15:07.140
All right,hey,I'm here,ready
to start rolling some calls.

15:07.157 --> 15:08.373
Okay,here goes.

15:08.386 --> 15:11.923
Everydy gets a list of people to call,
and as soon as you get a response,

15:11.938 --> 15:15.430
you let me know,and then i record it
on the big board over here.

15:15.445 --> 15:18.313
Okay,this is not downtown,by the way.
We're gonna have the party here.

15:18.326 --> 15:20.240
- What?
- Oh,it is?It's here?

15:20.256 --> 15:22.533
- Mom?
- Which actually it makes it extra convenient,

15:22.545 --> 15:24.823
because this way we can tell them to
send the presents here.

15:24.838 --> 15:26.321
Oh,that's true.

15:26.337 --> 15:27.333
Oh,you know-- you know what?

15:27.347 --> 15:32.711
Have them send the presents to robert's address,
since I'm gonna be moving out soon.

15:35.386 --> 15:37.832
You're moving out?

15:38.506 --> 15:40.291
Yeah.

15:40.306 --> 15:43.043
Oh,mom,I--come on,I mean,what did you think?

15:43.055 --> 15:46.040
Did you think that robert was gonna move in here?

15:46.058 --> 15:48.910
Oh,well,frankly,I-I-I-
i hadn't thought about it at all.

15:48.928 --> 15:53.723
I've been so preoccupied with the 3,000 little
things i've been doing for your engagement party.

15:53.737 --> 15:56.023
Right,the party that I didn't even want.

15:56.037 --> 15:57.992
Sweetie,you didn't talk to me for three months

15:58.006 --> 16:02.851
because I didn't throw you the sweet 16 party
you insisted on not having.

16:02.866 --> 16:05.252
Mom,that's different.I was 16.

16:05.266 --> 16:07.171
Everybody wants a sweet 16 party.

16:07.188 --> 16:09.850
Well,if you feel you're ready to move out,
then--then--

16:09.866 --> 16:12.080
- then you're ready to move out.
- Ready?Why wouldn't I be ready?

16:12.096 --> 16:15.980
Of course you're ready,
and i will miss your company terribly.

16:15.998 --> 16:18.623
But let's face it,you're a little old
to be living with your mother.

16:18.638 --> 16:20.391
Oh,you know what,mom?Why do you have to insult me?

16:20.407 --> 16:22.742
Why don't you just come out and
tell me that you're gonna miss me?

16:22.757 --> 16:25.192
Wellwhy can't you just come out
and say you're scared to move out?

16:25.208 --> 16:29.070
Why do you have to make me to this clinging,
neurotic mother who's trying to force you to stay?

16:29.088 --> 16:31.490
Wow,it's like the passive-aggressive
olympics here today.

16:31.506 --> 16:32.563
Oh,shut up,sarah.

16:32.575 --> 16:35.511
No,all ofou,stop this.
Now just stop it.It's not fair.

16:35.527 --> 16:37.191
I don't--I don't care if she moves out.

16:37.208 --> 16:40.572
I just resent the way she comes
in here and blithely announces--

16:40.588 --> 16:43.400
I have been trying to tell you for three days!

16:43.416 --> 16:46.192
But you don't want to think about it,
just like you don't want to think about
justin leaving,mother.

16:46.207 --> 16:50.150
- That is why you are throwing this party!
- Don't you dare bring your brother into this!

16:50.167 --> 16:51.993
I didn't want a party!

16:52.007 --> 16:56.680
We should be spending this te with justin,
not spending our time calling 18,000 people.

16:56.697 --> 16:58.550
Well,then fine-- don't help,just go.

16:58.567 --> 17:00.811
Fine,I will.I'm gonna start packing.

17:00.825 --> 17:02.181
- Well,good.
- Good.I'm not kidding.

17:02.196 --> 17:04.741
- Neither am I.
- Okay,great.Thank god!

17:04.756 --> 17:06.492
Thank god I'm getting out of this prison!

17:06.506 --> 17:10.092
Don't let the door hit you
on your way out,sweetie!

17:16.267 --> 17:18.540
That was amazing.

17:30.686 --> 17:34.722
No.They're all symmetrical.
Leave them for the guests.Go.

17:34.736 --> 17:36.702
What,I'm not a guest,mom?

17:36.716 --> 17:38.520
You live here,don't you?

17:38.535 --> 17:41.522
Let the man eat quiche.He's leaving tuesday.

17:41.536 --> 17:44.243
- It's tuesday,right?
- Uh,yeah,tuesday.

17:44.256 --> 17:47.600
- Mom,that happened.
- Oh,you!

17:48.535 --> 17:52.201
Jason,what you and kevin pulled off
is amazing,an absolute triumph,

17:52.217 --> 17:54.820
almost worth the sacrifice of my lawn.

17:54.835 --> 17:57.793
Oh,mother,enough about the grass.
You know what I'm gonna do?

17:57.806 --> 18:01.053
I'm gonna get you a truckload of
sod as a moving out present.

18:01.066 --> 18:04.110
What she is trying to say is thank
you for opening up your house.

18:04.388 --> 18:06.191
Well,you're welcome.

18:07.676 --> 18:10.261
- Just hope it's gonna be okay.
- Well,why wouldn't it be?

18:10.276 --> 18:15.572
Look,I don't want to make this into something
it's not,but,you know,it's about my family.

18:15.587 --> 18:17.810
They are...

18:19.498 --> 18:22.953
They're just...You know,they're...

18:28.398 --> 18:31.953
- hello.
- Nora walker.Hey,hut!

18:31.968 --> 18:34.403
Oh,you must be major w-- wiener.

18:34.416 --> 18:37.090
You were gonna say wiener.
Everybody says wiener.

18:37.108 --> 18:39.501
It's okay.Give us a hug.

18:40.427 --> 18:41.140
Okay there.

18:41.157 --> 18:43.851
- Hey,uncle jack.
- Hey,bobby,bobby,bobby.

18:43.866 --> 18:45.640
- Good to see you.
- My favorite nephew.

18:45.657 --> 18:50.210
Look at this guy.Can you believe that
this little bastard could be president?

18:50.226 --> 18:54.570
He used to follow me around all the time.
I used to bite his butt when he was little.

18:54.585 --> 18:57.712
- We used to call him little wiener.
- You know--uh,so you've menora...

18:57.726 --> 18:59.430
- But he stopped us from-
- and this is kitty,my fiancee.

18:59.446 --> 19:01.532
- Kitty!
- Hi.Hi,major wiener-- wiener.

19:01.545 --> 19:04.222
Call me jack,kitty.

19:04.755 --> 19:06.773
Are you ready?You ready?Don't move.Don't move.

19:06.786 --> 19:08.400
Just look-- guess what I got in here?

19:08.415 --> 19:09.982
I don't want to guess.

19:10.487 --> 19:12.543
- There it is.
- A button.

19:12.556 --> 19:14.292
I don't think we need to do the button thing here.

19:14.305 --> 19:16.621
Don't be modest.I brought
a whole bag full of them.

19:16.636 --> 19:18.103
You know,the party's out back here.

19:18.118 --> 19:21.653
Oh,no,it's not.The party's right here,
nora.Come on.

19:21.668 --> 19:26.191
We're gonna have a drink.
Tell the family to meet me at the bar.

19:26.205 --> 19:27.512
Um,good.

19:27.525 --> 19:29.371
- You still gonna marry me?
- Well,yeah,yeah.

19:29.388 --> 19:31.533
I mean,come on,so you have a crazy uncle.

19:31.547 --> 19:34.330
- Hey,robby!
- Hi,cousin margaret!

19:34.346 --> 19:36.862
- How you doing?
- You missed a great pub crawl.

19:36.878 --> 19:38.411
Hey,where's the can?

19:38.427 --> 19:41.002
The can?Oh,the bathroom.The bathroom.

19:41.016 --> 19:43.792
- The bathroom is right down that hallway.
- Thanks.

19:46.618 --> 19:48.881
- Okay,okay,down.
- I'll see you back in the tent.

19:48.897 --> 19:50.713
- See you out there.
- Okay.

19:50.727 --> 19:53.490
Uh,you can-- you can take the food.
Food goes back into the kitchen.

19:54.378 --> 19:55.963
- Hi,robby.
- Hi.

19:55.976 --> 19:59.093
Taste this,it's delicious.
Just make sure I get that glass back.

20:00.428 --> 20:03.162
I-I'm sorry.Excuse me,n-not upstairs.

20:05.798 --> 20:06.821
Saul?

20:07.726 --> 20:08.922
Saul!

20:09.076 --> 20:10.110
Yeah. Milo?

20:10.177 --> 20:11.311
Yeah. Hey!

20:11.397 --> 20:12.831
Hey,how are you? How are you?

20:13.338 --> 20:14.362
Good,good.

20:14.388 --> 20:16.201
- It's good to see you.
- Yeah.

20:16.368 --> 20:17.501
You seem a little shocked.

20:17.525 --> 20:18.553
Didn't nora tell you I was coming?

20:18.608 --> 20:23.020
Well,yeah,of course she told me,
but mi-- I mean,come on,milo,it's been years.

20:23.057 --> 20:23.833
Nearly 20.

20:23.876 --> 20:25.970
- You look great,milo.
- Oh,thanks. I feel great.

20:26.005 --> 20:28.542
I stilfeel 20 sometimes,
and then I look in the mirror--

20:28.597 --> 20:30.822
oh,no,no,you can't do that.

20:30.867 --> 20:32.811
I haven't done that for years.

20:33.075 --> 20:35.321
I-I'm sorry that we lost touch,you know?

20:35.406 --> 20:38.092
I still think about our trip to the--the keys.

20:38.807 --> 20:41.532
Someone told me that your daughter became a pediatrician.

20:41.586 --> 20:43.332
Yep,and the other one's an architect.

20:43.355 --> 20:45.343
Wow,an architect. That's amazing.

20:45.365 --> 20:46.793
Boy,they grow up fast.

20:46.848 --> 20:48.260
What about elaine? How is she?

20:48.306 --> 20:51.000
We divorced about a year ago.

20:51.047 --> 20:52.771
- I'm sorry.
- No,no,don't be.

20:52.835 --> 20:54.461
It was the right thi to do.

20:54.508 --> 20:56.061
How about you? Are you still a bachelor?

20:56.098 --> 20:58.211
Oh,yeah. Some things never change.

20:59.225 --> 21:00.781
Anyway,I was on my way to the kitchen.

21:00.826 --> 21:03.770
I have to get the caterer to bring out
some more of those mushroom little quiches.

21:03.816 --> 21:07.422
Listen,saul,don't you want to know why I left elaine?

21:07.466 --> 21:09.150
Well,I don't--I,uh...

21:09.188 --> 21:10.950
I'm not pretending anymore.

21:11.055 --> 21:12.102
I'm gay.

21:12.735 --> 21:16.052
A little late to be coming out of the closet,
I know,pointless,

21:16.105 --> 21:20.530
some would say,
but i've always been a late bloomer.

21:23.217 --> 21:25.152
That's wonderful for you.

21:25.846 --> 21:27.922
'S very brave,what you've done.

21:29.178 --> 21:32.533
Anyway,I'm gonna go to the kitchen
and get those mushroom things.

21:32.588 --> 21:34.193
- Catch up with you later.
- Yep.

21:36.238 --> 21:38.120
Cooper,i've been looking ev--

21:41.496 --> 21:42.320
Gotcha!

21:42.948 --> 21:44.363
Oh,I got you!

21:46.935 --> 21:52.532
Come on,cooper,I'm sure ms.Harper
has more important things to do than lurk behind stuff.

21:52.735 --> 21:54.101
Coop? Come on.

21:54.218 --> 21:56.362
There's,um,chocolate brownies in the kitchen.

21:56.428 --> 21:58.401
You might want to hurry or they'll all be gone.

22:02.277 --> 22:04.980
I'm sorry. I hope you didn't feel obligated to--

22:05.016 --> 22:07.083
oh,no,no,no,it was fun.

22:09.016 --> 22:12.411
- Holly,can I ask you something?
- Hmm?

22:13.086 --> 22:16.822
How do actors memorize their lines so quickly?

22:17.245 --> 22:20.830
I have to do a speech for the happy couple.

22:20.927 --> 22:22.001
Oh,yeah.

22:22.475 --> 22:23.751
That's always fun.

22:23.808 --> 22:24.633
Yeah.

22:24.665 --> 22:26.610
I haven't written it yet.

22:26.895 --> 22:29.443
I always dreaded weddings.

22:29.526 --> 22:32.610
Well,you can imagine--
sitting at the singles' table,

22:32.676 --> 22:37.623
and as far as anyone else was concerned,
that's what I was,single.

22:37.995 --> 22:40.092
Why keep putting yourself through it?

22:40.156 --> 22:41.321
I don't know.

22:42.216 --> 22:46.252
There's always something so magical about weddings--

22:46.328 --> 22:51.823
these two people willing to take a chance
in front of everyone that they know.

22:51.857 --> 22:57.900
It's incredibly naive,
but at the same time incredibly hopeful.

22:58.498 --> 23:00.193
Maybyou should do the speech.

23:01.476 --> 23:03.013
No,you'll be fine.

23:05.588 --> 23:07.631
So why are you being so nice?

23:07.707 --> 23:12.651
Well,I feel that we have more in common
than we're willing to acknowledge...

23:13.357 --> 23:16.701
And I'm tired of hating you and of you hating me.

23:21.668 --> 23:22.732
What are you doing?

23:22.796 --> 23:24.172
Looking for a band-aid.

23:24.328 --> 23:25.533
One of my cousins cut himself.

23:25.585 --> 23:26.793
Oh,that doesn't surprise me.

23:26.826 --> 23:29.153
I'm shocked half of them made it to adulthood.

23:29.606 --> 23:31.281
You think we're so beneath you,don't you?

23:31.336 --> 23:33.322
Uh,I think you're all insane,yeah...

23:33.378 --> 23:34.742
And drunk.

23:35.566 --> 23:38.233
Yeah? What's that,like,your fourth margarita?

23:38.248 --> 23:39.951
Why don't you just carry around a pitcher?

23:42.787 --> 23:45.900
Well,at least I'm not stealing the flower arrangements.

23:45.935 --> 23:50.121
Okay,for the record, you're allowed to
take the flower arrangements home at a party.

23:50.138 --> 23:52.330
Mm,usually when the party's over.

23:52.376 --> 23:56.011
At the moment,one of your cousins' minivans
looks like a florist's truck.

23:56.065 --> 23:58.320
Well,your uncle saul practically tackled my aunt phyllis.

23:58.368 --> 24:03.261
Yeah,he was trying to stop her from replacing
the shellfish tower with an artichoke mold.

24:03.316 --> 24:04.941
It's an artichoke ambrosia.

24:06.505 --> 24:07.993
Why are you such an unpleasant person?

24:08.037 --> 24:09.211
- What do you care?
- I don't.

24:09.257 --> 24:11.690
You didn't come in here looking for a band-aid,did you?

24:11.958 --> 24:13.830
You came in here looking for me.

24:13.985 --> 24:14.893
Maybe.

24:26.805 --> 24:30.171
tommy,you don't know how to make a screaming orgasm?

24:30.216 --> 24:33.870
No,but I have a feeling you're gonna teach me,
cousin catherine.

24:37.748 --> 24:39.043
I'm sorry about my family.

24:39.055 --> 24:41.590
You never have to apologize for family.

24:41.636 --> 24:46.040
Besides,it's--
it's refreshing to be the tame ones for a change.

24:48.937 --> 24:50.710
You're still mad at kitty,aren't you?

24:50.938 --> 24:53.790
I'm mad at everybody.
And everybody's mad at me,too,I guess.

24:53.895 --> 24:57.871
Well,it's one of the first things
they tell you in politics is you can't please everybody.

24:58.095 --> 25:01.453
But i'll talk to kitty. There's no reason
you guys should be fighting on a day like today.

25:01.998 --> 25:03.560
Oh,it's not kitty.

25:03.906 --> 25:06.983
I'm--I'm glad she's moving out,moving in with you.

25:07.035 --> 25:07.970
Wait a minute.

25:08.017 --> 25:09.262
You're glad?

25:09.648 --> 25:10.803
Okay,it's official.

25:10.865 --> 25:12.991
All walker women are confusing.

25:14.086 --> 25:15.323
I'm just taking it out on her.

25:15.345 --> 25:17.512
I do that sometimes.

25:17.557 --> 25:21.211
I know kitty's gonna be nearby,but justin isn't.

25:22.238 --> 25:25.253
He wants to spend the day with me to say good-bye,
and I'm not gonna do it.

25:25.686 --> 25:27.820
It's hard to be the one leaving,too.

25:30.467 --> 25:33.611
I was serving in the first gulf war when my father died.

25:33.786 --> 25:39.271
It was just bad luck the way it happened,
but my point is that I didn't get to say good-bye.

25:40.668 --> 25:42.451
Things happen in war,nora.

25:43.375 --> 25:46.232
If your son wants to say good-bye,
I think you should let him.

25:47.736 --> 25:49.170
Family,fall in!

25:49.195 --> 25:51.373
It's the party train!

25:53.885 --> 25:55.361
Uncle jack!

25:55.836 --> 25:56.661
Nora,baby...

25:56.716 --> 25:57.510
No,no,no.

25:57.567 --> 26:00.051
Climb aboard the love train.

26:00.096 --> 26:03.343
No,I don't wanna--
no,keep your hands off the caboose.

26:03.388 --> 26:05.321
- Hey!
- Oh,my god in heaven.

26:05.375 --> 26:07.003
A walker engine!

26:12.718 --> 26:14.560
Do you still think I'm electable?

26:14.755 --> 26:16.763
Hmm. Probably not.

26:17.195 --> 26:19.631
Lead the love train! Pickin' up the speed!

26:19.688 --> 26:22.740
I don't remember this song being this long!

26:22.797 --> 26:25.091
Oh,my god. Is that man vomiting?

26:25.125 --> 26:27.572
Cousin larry. Weak stomach.

26:31.216 --> 26:32.602
Oh,my god!

26:39.418 --> 26:40.611
Perfect.

26:48.227 --> 26:50.662
Hey. What are you doing here?

26:50.716 --> 26:53.910
Oh,sorry.
I just-- just taking a little breather.

26:55.185 --> 26:55.951
Well,what's the matter?

26:55.996 --> 26:58.331
The tent hit you in the head or something?

26:59.138 --> 27:00.322
No.

27:00.375 --> 27:03.151
I just don't feel very comfortable being here today.

27:03.207 --> 27:05.641
Oh,come on. Tell me this doesn't have to do with
the joe and sarah thing again.

27:05.686 --> 27:07.490
Justin,I practically broke up their marriage,

27:07.537 --> 27:09.513
and now I'm at your other sister's engagement party.

27:09.556 --> 27:10.951
It's a little bit bizarre.

27:10.988 --> 27:11.742
Okay,you know what? First of all,

27:11.797 --> 27:15.331
joe and sarah were heading down that road way
before you showed up.

27:15.355 --> 27:17.762
Okay,and secondly,how many times
do we have to tell you this,rebecca?

27:17.796 --> 27:20.741
I mean,you're--you know,
you're part of the family now.

27:22.985 --> 27:25.820
If you knew everything about me,
justin,you'd...

27:26.586 --> 27:27.970
What does that mean?

27:30.145 --> 27:33.890
Joe wasn't the only older man.

27:35.475 --> 27:36.501
Okay.

27:38.098 --> 27:40.050
There was somebody else.

27:40.868 --> 27:42.582
He was a teacher.

27:44.457 --> 27:46.091
He had a family.

27:47.518 --> 27:49.321
So how old were you?

27:50.246 --> 27:53.631
16 Yeah.

27:54.926 --> 27:56.833
Eventually his wife found out.

27:56.878 --> 27:59.283
And everyone told my mom to press charges,

27:59.326 --> 28:02.170
but I begged her not to,so she didn't.

28:03.336 --> 28:07.410
And evan,the guy,
moved his family up to chicago.

28:08.918 --> 28:10.863
I thought I could let it go.

28:11.498 --> 28:16.843
I did,but then he called to apologize,
and I hopped on a bus.

28:17.198 --> 28:18.751
I went uthere.

28:20.138 --> 28:22.561
I never went to school there,justin.

28:23.405 --> 28:26.001
He put me up in a hotel so he could...

28:29.616 --> 28:34.082
And then a month later,
his wife found out again,and,um...

28:37.198 --> 28:38.933
He killed himself.

28:42.508 --> 28:45.173
I'm--I'm sorry,rebecca.

28:49.898 --> 28:52.660
So why don't you just ask me?

28:53.988 --> 28:55.390
Ask you what?

28:55.458 --> 28:57.811
If I had something to do with that kiss?

28:58.315 --> 28:59.580
Did you?

29:00.916 --> 29:02.131
Yeah.

29:02.255 --> 29:03.391
I don't know what I was thinking.

29:03.446 --> 29:06.091
And I-I certainly don't know
what joe was thinking in that moment, but I--

29:06.126 --> 29:08.380
look,you need to tell sarah,okay?

29:08.415 --> 29:10.612
Not just for her,but for you,too.

29:12.218 --> 29:13.700
Will you come with me?

29:14.216 --> 29:15.622
I can't.

29:17.327 --> 29:18.740
I'm leaving tonight.

29:18.796 --> 29:21.822
I mean,that's why I came up here--
to get my uniform and...

29:23.055 --> 29:25.262
No one knows downstairs.

29:25.708 --> 29:27.020
But you weren't gonna say good-bye?

29:27.107 --> 29:28.820
I don't wanna ruin anything this time.

29:28.865 --> 29:30.521
Well,so you think that you could just leave without--

29:30.567 --> 29:33.382
it'll be easier on everyone,okay?

29:41.426 --> 29:43.061
I'm gonna miss you justin.

29:44.386 --> 29:45.833
I'm gonna miss you,too.

29:48.395 --> 29:49.901
Hey,everyone.

29:50.177 --> 29:51.262
Hey.

29:51.348 --> 29:54.580
I'm,um,sarah,kitty's sister.

29:54.647 --> 29:58.303
I think that tent coming down was a sign
that you can't control everything,

29:58.365 --> 30:02.021
which is kind of apropos-- an engagement party--

30:02.067 --> 30:05.502
talk about stepping into the great unknown.

30:05.616 --> 30:08.621
Two people who happen to love each other

30:08.676 --> 30:12.531
are suddenly gonna transform themselves
into something totally different--

30:12.835 --> 30:15.750
a family. Family--god.

30:15.907 --> 30:19.111
It's the best and the worst thing
that can ever happen to us.

30:19.127 --> 30:21.911
A lot of the times we wanna kill each other.

30:21.957 --> 30:24.063
Okay,most of the time.

30:24.108 --> 30:30.240
But the truth is that without each other,
we would be truly lost.

30:30.547 --> 30:33.832
So I would like to propose a toast to families...

30:34.175 --> 30:41.520
To what an amazing and rare thing it is to be
part of one so large and wonderful...

30:41.876 --> 30:48.673
To my sister,who I love completely and totally...

30:49.188 --> 30:53.420
And to robert and everyone that you bring to the table.

30:53.696 --> 31:00.222
So to our new family that is bigger and better and greater
than the sum of its parts.

31:00.297 --> 31:01.240
Here,here.

31:01.316 --> 31:02.963
Salud!

31:03.845 --> 31:04.851
Sarah,thank you.

31:04.907 --> 31:06.380
That was just beautiful.

31:06.785 --> 31:11.031
Um,I thought I'd spare you
all hearing another speech from me.

31:11.117 --> 31:14.263
So i've asked my brother jason
to lead us in a blessing.

31:14.378 --> 31:15.620
Absolutely.

31:16.188 --> 31:18.862
If you'd all,uh,just bow your heads wi me.

31:21.705 --> 31:25.910
Lord,behold our family here assembled.

31:25.997 --> 31:28.290
We thank you for the peace accorded to us this day...

31:28.335 --> 31:29.543
Kevin!

31:32.098 --> 31:35.700
Of all the situations you've ever put me in...

31:35.925 --> 31:36.823
He's a minister?

31:36.895 --> 31:38.001
Yes,he's a minister.

31:38.066 --> 31:39.510
Have you never met a minister before?

31:39.596 --> 31:41.920
Uh,i've never sucked face with one before.

31:41.998 --> 31:42.953
- You did not.
- Yeah.

31:42.997 --> 31:44.930
You did not. You sucked face with him?

31:44.975 --> 31:46.061
Kevin,kevin,that's great!

31:46.108 --> 31:48.901
How--kitty,how could you not have told me about this?

31:48.946 --> 31:50.313
Well,because I didn't know,kevin.

31:50.367 --> 31:52.211
I don't-- I didn't. I didn't.
I swear to god.

31:52.265 --> 31:55.853
You know what?
You're the worst communications director ever.

31:55.938 --> 31:59.630
If he wins the election,
you're gonna be the first first lady to be impeached.

32:00.976 --> 32:04.561
And we thank you for this beautiful place in which we dwell,

32:04.687 --> 32:09.532
for the love that unites us and for our friends
in all parts of the earth. Amen.

32:15.197 --> 32:16.880
mom,what are you doing in here?

32:16.977 --> 32:17.961
Resting.

32:19.138 --> 32:23.571
Trying to not think about that tent
collapsing as a metaphor for my life.

32:23.997 --> 32:28.061
You know,mom,sometimes a tent...

32:28.588 --> 32:30.642
Is just a tent

32:33.736 --> 32:35.141
look,I'M...

32:37.477 --> 32:42.381
I'm sorry I'm moving out,
and I'm so sorry for the way I told you.

32:43.406 --> 32:47.140
No,there is no reason to apologize,
none whatsoever.

32:47.208 --> 32:48.303
It's my job.

32:48.358 --> 32:49.801
It's what mothers do.

32:50.016 --> 32:54.603
All the people I love come here on their way
to and from the big moments of their lives.

32:54.925 --> 32:56.590
It's like,uh...

32:57.665 --> 33:00.211
I don't know.
What--what do they call a safe place where you--

33:00.257 --> 33:04.103
you go to rest and recover and get stronger?

33:04.175 --> 33:05.422
A spa?

33:05.448 --> 33:07.992
No. No,a sanctuary!

33:08.185 --> 33:10.243
Yeah,they call it a sanctuary.

33:10.917 --> 33:14.723
Well,with the year we've had,you can understand

33:14.796 --> 33:18.160
how I was just trying to hold on to it a little bit longer.

33:19.316 --> 33:24.320
And now you're both moving out at once,
and it's a hard one.

33:25.746 --> 33:27.460
Oh,mom.

33:29.827 --> 33:32.172
Thank you for letting me stay.

33:33.027 --> 33:35.542
Yeah,it's a-- it's been an awful year...

33:35.595 --> 33:38.822
But it's been the best awful year of my life.

33:44.426 --> 33:46.183
Oh,um...I'm sorry.

33:46.257 --> 33:47.810
I don't mean to interrupt.

33:47.848 --> 33:48.841
Is something wrong?

33:48.896 --> 33:51.371
I promised I wouldn't say anything,but,um...

33:52.527 --> 33:55.490
The army pushed justin's report date up.

33:55.566 --> 33:57.480
- He has to go back early.
- What?

33:57.538 --> 33:59.243
The thing is,he didn't wanna spoil your party,so--

33:59.296 --> 34:00.510
well,where is he now?

34:00.576 --> 34:01.831
He's at the airport.

34:01.888 --> 34:03.101
- Oh,god.
- Oh,my god,kitty.

34:03.148 --> 34:04.203
- No,no,yeah.
- We have to go find him.

34:04.257 --> 34:05.982
- No,will. I'm gonna get the car.
- We have to find him now.

34:06.046 --> 34:06.882
You get the car.

34:27.646 --> 34:28.851
Excuse me.

34:28.917 --> 34:31.213
Excuse us. Excuse us. Excuse us.

34:32.025 --> 34:33.201
Pardon me. Excuse us.

34:33.216 --> 34:35.080
I need to see your ticket and identification,please.

34:35.114 --> 34:36.451
Look,we don't have a ticket.

34:36.516 --> 34:37.723
We're just here to say good-bye to someone.

34:37.775 --> 34:39.571
I'm sorry. You can't pass through without a ticket.

34:39.597 --> 34:41.342
Well,okay. Okay. Well,let's go buy a ticket.

34:41.397 --> 34:42.561
- What if we buy a ticket?
- We don't have time to buy one.

34:42.617 --> 34:43.293
Please,please,please,ma'am.

34:43.335 --> 34:45.953
It's my son,justin,and he's being shipped off to iraq.

34:45.976 --> 34:48.072
- I'm sorry,ma'am. I wish I could help you.
- He left before we had a chance to say good-bye.

34:48.085 --> 34:50.072
- But we're just gonna go in real quick and come back.
- Government rules.

34:50.118 --> 34:52.973
I need to see your ticket,please,and identification.

34:53.344 --> 34:54.591
Thank you,yes.

34:54.677 --> 34:56.000
We have a line here,ladies.

34:56.065 --> 34:56.981
Thank you.

35:07.156 --> 35:08.842
I tried his cell phone again.

35:08.915 --> 35:10.273
It's his voice mail.

35:10.567 --> 35:12.321
Justin,this is your mother.

35:12.736 --> 35:14.530
I'm so angry at you.

35:14.597 --> 35:17.091
How cod you go off without saying good-bye?

35:17.577 --> 35:20.031
I'm sorry I didn't go to the museum with you.

35:20.176 --> 35:23.340
It was so sweet of you to think of something
I wanted to do,

35:23.405 --> 35:25.722
and that's just like you,
thinking of everybody else.

35:25.775 --> 35:27.180
You have to stop that.

35:27.247 --> 35:30.450
Do you hear me? I want you to stop that right now.
I don't--

35:30.477 --> 35:32.170
you guys are unbelievable.

35:32.838 --> 35:33.702
Come here.

35:35.757 --> 35:37.360
Oh,justin.

35:38.787 --> 35:41.372
Well,good thing I was in the bathroom,
changing into this.

35:43.176 --> 35:44.011
Look,kitty. I'm--I'm sorry.

35:44.055 --> 35:45.253
I didn't wanna ruin your party.

35:45.316 --> 35:46.333
- Oh,god,justin!
- I wanted to kill you!

35:46.367 --> 35:48.802
You know what? You are such an idiot!

35:52.126 --> 35:54.013
Well,here we go again,right?

35:57.347 --> 36:01.023
You know,I don't,um,
I don't know what I believe in anymore,

36:01.565 --> 36:03.611
but I know that I believe in you.

36:05.237 --> 36:07.391
And I love you so much.

36:08.536 --> 36:09.802
I love you,too.

36:11.856 --> 36:13.961
- You take care of yourself,okay?
- I will.

36:18.577 --> 36:20.260
Come here,mom. Come here.

36:23.546 --> 36:27.392
- I'm gonna be okay.
- yeah.

36:28.135 --> 36:33.563
Justin,you don't have to say anything
or do anything for me.

36:34.737 --> 36:36.763
I came to say good-bye.

36:38.266 --> 36:39.692
I love you,mom.

36:40.778 --> 36:42.463
I love you,too.

36:43.225 --> 36:46.620
And I'm gonna be just as brave as you are.

36:46.746 --> 36:47.940
I promise.

36:50.395 --> 36:51.910
I'm gonna miss my flight.

36:52.808 --> 36:53.531
I love you,mom.

36:53.545 --> 36:55.010
I love you. I love you.

37:03.607 --> 37:04.430
All right,ticketed passengers.

37:04.488 --> 37:08.522
We got a soldier here going off to fight
for his country, so make some room.

37:08.825 --> 37:09.731
Right this way,sir.

37:36.668 --> 37:40.361
hey, Um,look.
You weren't kidding back there,were you?

37:40.428 --> 37:42.823
It wasn't--
it wasn't some kind of party trick,was it?

37:42.855 --> 37:45.331
No. I'm a methodist minister.

37:45.477 --> 37:49.463
We were raised catholic,
but,I,uh,I needed a friendlier audience.

37:49.507 --> 37:51.041
- Let's put it that way.
- Right.

37:51.086 --> 37:52.942
Kevin,I wasn't hiding anything.

37:52.998 --> 37:54.202
It just never came up.

37:54.238 --> 37:56.201
Sure. So,um...

37:56.526 --> 37:58.712
So do you have,like,a congregation?

37:58.775 --> 38:00.552
Yeah. Downtown.

38:00.615 --> 38:01.221
Great.

38:01.286 --> 38:03.481
But you're--
you're not republican,though,are you?

38:03.526 --> 38:05.343
No. No. But I'd vote for my brother.

38:05.396 --> 38:07.723
Oh,that's nothing.
My sister is about to marry him.

38:08.408 --> 38:10.631
I think our families deserve each other.

38:11.207 --> 38:14.463
You know,I,um,well,my--my offices are downtown.

38:14.525 --> 38:17.162
Maybe-- well,you know,we should have lunch sometime.

38:17.496 --> 38:19.401
Look,kevin,I...

38:19.518 --> 38:21.571
I'm a very traditional person.

38:21.706 --> 38:24.220
Jumping your bones was extremely atypical for me.

38:24.297 --> 38:26.451
Well,I could use some tradition in my life.

38:33.017 --> 38:35.983
Saul,I'm gonna be going.

38:36.858 --> 38:38.522
It was wonderful seeing you again.

38:38.606 --> 38:39.933
You,too,milo.

38:40.027 --> 38:41.951
I bought a little house in nichols canyon.

38:42.035 --> 38:44.963
I'd love it if you'd come up for lunch,dinner.

38:46.075 --> 38:48.720
The truth is,milo,I'm pretty busy these days,
and I-I--

38:48.766 --> 38:51.632
saulie,we're too old for excuses.

38:53.785 --> 38:55.223
I've misd you.

38:59.455 --> 39:00.763
Call me.

39:13.805 --> 39:15.092
tequila!

39:15.776 --> 39:17.363
Bombs away!

39:19.247 --> 39:20.743
Be careful.

39:22.696 --> 39:26.243
- Dear god in heaven.
- Mom! What--what happened?

39:26.315 --> 39:27.462
Well,what happened here?

39:27.515 --> 39:29.181
- I thought you guys were manning the house.
- Yeah.

39:29.225 --> 39:31.941
We tried,but there's--
there's too many of them.

39:31.976 --> 39:34.242
I stopped two guys peeing in your pansies.

39:34.278 --> 39:35.143
Wait,did you catch him?

39:35.187 --> 39:36.162
Yeah,just barely.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.521
- Mom,are you okay?
- Yeah.

39:37.577 --> 39:40.392
- Nora,how's justin?
- Fine.

39:40.458 --> 39:42.311
- Oh,mom.
- No,no,don't start. Don't start.

39:42.367 --> 39:43.803
I had the whole waterworks in the car.

39:43.846 --> 39:44.843
I can't cry anymore.

39:44.887 --> 39:49.511
And luckily,i've got the whole cast
of animal house here to distract me.

39:49.566 --> 39:50.912
Yeah,good luck with the new family,kitty.

39:50.946 --> 39:51.890
Oh,come on. Come on.

39:51.947 --> 39:53.283
Like we're not all a little nuts.

39:53.336 --> 39:55.413
Yeah,but they took it to a whole new level.

39:55.457 --> 39:56.181
Whole new level.

39:56.235 --> 39:59.213
Nora,I'm gonna give you a check today for all this damage.

39:59.278 --> 40:00.161
Oh,no,don't worry about it.

40:00.207 --> 40:03.432
What with everything we've been through this year,
what's a little property damage?

40:03.487 --> 40:07.083
And,you know,at least your family
knows how to have a good time.

40:07.117 --> 40:09.750
I mean,look at us. We're all sitting around here
like a bunch of party poopers.

40:09.798 --> 40:12.163
Nora,how could we possibly compete with the mccrazies?

40:12.188 --> 40:13.410
Hey,walkers!

40:13.445 --> 40:14.540
Have a shot.

40:14.586 --> 40:17.211
Come on! You guys don't wanna be wallflowers.

40:22.196 --> 40:23.791
Oh,jack!

40:25.176 --> 40:29.601
Last one in the pool is a major weenie.

40:29.636 --> 40:30.740
Uh,mom.

40:30.808 --> 40:31.680
What is she doing?

40:31.718 --> 40:32.453
She's not serious.

40:32.485 --> 40:33.473
She's not going in.

40:34.585 --> 40:35.630
Mom!

40:37.305 --> 40:38.873
Oh,she is!

40:40.907 --> 40:42.203
What's going on?

40:42.268 --> 40:43.211
Pool party.

40:43.288 --> 40:45.560
Well,I'm just gonna take my jacket off first.

40:50.147 --> 40:51.113
You up for it,mom?

40:51.177 --> 40:53.012
- Why the hell not?
- Let's go!

40:59.498 --> 41:02.491
Are you coming,
or are the walkers just a little too much for you?

41:02.546 --> 41:04.972
No,kitty. I'm a united states senator. Please.
