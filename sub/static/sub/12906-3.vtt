WEBVTT

00:01.628 --> 00:02.585
Oh, my God.

00:02.620 --> 00:03.831
I've been keeping
Tucker away from it all.

00:03.866 --> 00:05.265
Does he know what
happened to his mommy?

00:05.301 --> 00:07.766
He knows, but I don't think
he understands.

00:08.061 --> 00:09.262
Spence Westmore,
you're under arrest

00:09.297 --> 00:10.696
for the murder
of Peri Westmore.

00:10.732 --> 00:12.332
If someone saw Spence,
I can prove he's innocent.

00:12.367 --> 00:14.033
Oh, yeah, he was here.

00:14.068 --> 00:17.003
So he was here between 1:00
and 3:00 and not at home?

00:17.038 --> 00:18.504
I'm here to help.

00:18.539 --> 00:20.372
We need to find out
who really killed Peri.

00:20.407 --> 00:22.541
I have a witness.
Her name is Cinnamon.

00:22.576 --> 00:25.210
This case is closed.
We've already got a confession.

00:25.246 --> 00:28.247
I killed Peri.

00:28.282 --> 00:30.750
As long as I'm in this chair,
she won't leave me.

00:30.785 --> 00:32.717
Give it up.
I know you can walk.

00:32.753 --> 00:34.019
I'm leaving you.

00:34.054 --> 00:35.887
Evelyn, we were meant
to be together.

00:35.922 --> 00:38.486
I'm tired of it.
I'm tired of you!

00:38.630 --> 00:41.097
I'm Daniela!
Your cousin Josefina's daughter?

00:41.133 --> 00:42.699
That girl's your daughter?

00:42.734 --> 00:45.235
My cousin Josefina...
She raised her as her own.

00:45.270 --> 00:47.070
So, she doesn't
even know she's adopted?

00:47.105 --> 00:48.771
I'm gonna be working
here as a maid!

00:48.807 --> 00:50.206
- Name?
- I'm a hot girl.

00:50.241 --> 00:52.141
I can see that.

00:52.176 --> 00:53.737
Big fashion exec
just bought this place.

00:53.745 --> 00:55.311
She's gonna be gone
for six months.

00:55.347 --> 00:57.814
<i>I was drinking
and trying on the owner's gowns.</i>

00:57.849 --> 01:00.783
This really cute guy came over
and assumed I owned the house,

01:00.819 --> 01:02.318
so I went with it.

01:02.354 --> 01:04.420
Kyle, is that you?

01:04.456 --> 01:06.922
You didn't mention
your mother was visiting.

01:06.958 --> 01:09.424
She's not visiting. She lives here.
Your mother's great.

01:09.460 --> 01:11.327
I can see why you want
to spend time with her.

01:11.362 --> 01:13.562
I like her, too.
But not for you.

01:13.597 --> 01:15.430
I have other plans
for you, Kyle.

01:15.466 --> 01:18.300
I think there's
something between us.

01:18.336 --> 01:19.835
Peter.

01:19.871 --> 01:21.937
Husband number three...
the one who got away.

01:21.973 --> 01:23.472
Please stop dating Peter.

01:23.507 --> 01:24.973
I'm not breaking up with him.

01:25.008 --> 01:25.908
This means war.

01:28.945 --> 01:31.747
I can't believe
you've never been here.

01:31.782 --> 01:33.515
It's one of my favorites.

01:33.550 --> 01:35.283
Well, you have good taste
in men.

01:35.318 --> 01:37.452
I'm sure you have good taste
in food, too.

01:37.488 --> 01:39.520
Oh, I have great taste in food.

01:39.555 --> 01:41.489
Jury's still out on the men.

01:41.524 --> 01:43.024
[Both chuckle]

01:43.059 --> 01:45.960
Hi, I have a reservation.
Marisol Suarez for two.

01:45.996 --> 01:48.263
I don't have you.

01:48.298 --> 01:49.931
I just called yesterday.

01:49.966 --> 01:51.032
Well, it's not there.

01:51.067 --> 01:52.633
You don't seem to be that busy.

01:52.668 --> 01:54.335
I'm sure you could
still seat us,

01:54.371 --> 01:55.836
even without a reservation.

01:55.872 --> 01:57.170
I'm afraid not.

01:57.206 --> 01:58.773
Take that couple
to table 9, please.

01:58.808 --> 02:00.641
Hey, they don't have
a reservation.

02:00.676 --> 02:02.309
I'm sorry.

02:02.344 --> 02:04.712
One of our regulars
has requested we not serve you.

02:04.747 --> 02:05.713
Excuse me?

02:09.852 --> 02:12.052
I think what you're doing
is shameful,

02:12.087 --> 02:13.820
seeing that woman's husband.

02:13.855 --> 02:16.489
Ex-husband.

02:18.193 --> 02:21.328
Peter.
How wonderful to see you.

02:21.363 --> 02:24.564
Genevieve, are you blocking us
from eating here?

02:24.599 --> 02:27.500
I love the smell
of that aftershave.

02:27.536 --> 02:30.670
Or is that just your
natural manly musk?

02:30.705 --> 02:32.038
Don't talk about his musk.

02:32.073 --> 02:34.006
What a shame
you couldn't be seated.

02:34.042 --> 02:35.875
Would you like to join me,
Peter?

02:35.911 --> 02:37.043
I have an extra chair.

02:37.078 --> 02:38.545
She is ignoring me.

02:38.580 --> 02:41.881
You can see very well
that I'm with Marisol.

02:41.917 --> 02:44.818
Perhaps she can have
a little doggy bag in the car.

02:44.853 --> 02:46.986
Don't make me
take off my earrings.

02:47.021 --> 02:49.088
Come on.
We'll go somewhere else.

02:52.427 --> 02:54.060
I told you she was upset.

02:54.095 --> 02:56.062
Can't you do anything about it?

02:56.097 --> 02:58.497
Genevieve is just looking
for attention.

02:58.532 --> 03:00.232
If we ignore her,
she'll stop it.

03:00.268 --> 03:01.367
Eventually.

03:01.402 --> 03:03.435
Come on.
You're a studio head.

03:03.471 --> 03:05.604
You terrify people
for a living.

03:05.639 --> 03:07.906
All she did was cancel
our reservation.

03:07.942 --> 03:10.943
If that's the worst she's got,
it's not really that bad.

03:10.978 --> 03:12.210
I guess you're right.

03:12.245 --> 03:14.379
There's my car.

03:17.317 --> 03:19.017
What the hell?

03:19.052 --> 03:22.287
_

03:22.322 --> 03:25.390

Danni.

03:42.609 --> 03:43.708
What are you doing?

03:43.743 --> 03:45.309
Oh. My bad.

03:45.344 --> 03:48.646
I don't care about the couch.
I'm talking about the weed.

03:48.681 --> 03:51.715
[Laughs] Relax.
It's medical marijuana.

03:51.750 --> 03:52.716
Really.

03:52.751 --> 03:54.751
Yes.
I have glaucoma.

03:54.786 --> 03:56.420
You shouldn't be doing drugs.

03:56.455 --> 03:58.989
I thought you were cooler
than this.

03:59.025 --> 04:00.724
I'm cool.

04:00.759 --> 04:03.160
You're just like my mom,
telling me how to live my life.

04:03.195 --> 04:05.062
That's why I had to get away
from her.

04:06.098 --> 04:08.097
You didn't let me finish.

04:08.133 --> 04:11.334
You shouldn't be doing drugs
inside the house.

04:11.369 --> 04:14.638
If Mr. Powell walked in,
you'd be in big trouble. Oh.

04:14.673 --> 04:17.607
I mean, if it was just you
and me, I'd say, "Pfft.

04:17.642 --> 04:18.942
Do whatever you want."

04:18.976 --> 04:20.442
You know me.
I'm fun.

04:20.478 --> 04:22.913
But Mr. Powell
would fire you like that.

04:22.948 --> 04:25.281
Oh.
<i>Gracias,</i> Carmen.

04:25.316 --> 04:28.151
Where are you going?

04:28.186 --> 04:30.453
Didn't Mr. Powell ask you
to scrub the floors?

04:30.488 --> 04:31.654
He did,

04:31.689 --> 04:35.591
but my glaucoma really hurts.

04:44.201 --> 04:45.300
Hey.

04:45.335 --> 04:47.335
I wasn't sure that you'd come.

04:47.371 --> 04:51.173
Of course I came.
I will always be there for you.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.675
Even after what I did?

04:52.710 --> 04:54.176
You didn't do anything.

04:54.211 --> 04:56.645
I don't understand
why you confessed.

04:56.681 --> 04:58.146
Because I'm guilty, Rosie.

04:58.182 --> 05:00.682
You told me you blacked out,
that you don't remember

05:00.717 --> 05:02.884
what happened
The night of Peri's murder.

05:02.919 --> 05:04.786
Yeah, well,
Ben came by for a visit

05:04.821 --> 05:06.688
and he helped me
piece it together.

05:06.723 --> 05:07.989
Ben?

05:08.024 --> 05:09.124
My sponsor.

05:09.159 --> 05:10.392
You know Ben.
My good friend.

05:10.427 --> 05:12.227
I've never heard of him.

05:12.262 --> 05:14.996
I thought
I'd known him for years.

05:15.031 --> 05:16.998
You see?
You were tricked.

05:17.033 --> 05:20.334
And somehow you were tricked
into confessing, too.

05:20.369 --> 05:23.304
Rosie, I can see it in my mind.
I killed Peri.

05:23.339 --> 05:25.306
You couldn't have.

05:25.341 --> 05:27.541
I found you an alibi.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.410
The police didn't
want to hear about it

05:29.445 --> 05:31.044
because, well,
she's a stripper.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.513
Rosie, stop.

05:32.548 --> 05:34.248
The only thing
that matters now is Tucker.

05:34.283 --> 05:36.550
He doesn't have a mom
or a dad anymore.

05:36.586 --> 05:37.651
All he has is you.

05:37.686 --> 05:39.153
Me?

05:39.188 --> 05:42.089
I don't want him to become
a ward of the state.

05:42.125 --> 05:44.758
You were his nanny.
You're great with him.

05:44.793 --> 05:46.360
I know it's a lot, but...

05:46.395 --> 05:48.862
I will take care of your son,
Spence.

05:48.897 --> 05:51.498
But only until
I get you out of here.

05:57.973 --> 05:59.673
You said to call if I heard

05:59.708 --> 06:02.109
anything interesting
about Spence Westmore.

06:02.144 --> 06:03.510
<i>Yeah, what's up?</i>

06:03.545 --> 06:05.178
His ex found him an alibi.

06:05.213 --> 06:08.248
Well, that's certainly
interesting.

06:10.752 --> 06:12.619
- Hey.
- Hi.

06:12.654 --> 06:15.221
I hope it's okay
for me to just pop by.

06:15.257 --> 06:18.090
Are you kidding?
You're my favorite neighbor.

06:18.126 --> 06:20.359
And not just because
Mrs. Azarian

06:20.394 --> 06:23.129
retrieves the morning paper
in her brazier.

06:23.164 --> 06:25.865
[Groans]
I promise to never do that.

06:25.900 --> 06:26.932
[Both chuckle]

06:26.968 --> 06:28.267
Is Kyle home?

06:28.302 --> 06:30.302
I was hoping
he could come out and play.

06:30.337 --> 06:31.603
Oh!

06:31.639 --> 06:35.207
No, he's out of town.
Family business.

06:35.242 --> 06:36.308
Oh.

06:36.343 --> 06:38.109
I hope everything is okay.

06:38.145 --> 06:40.779
Oh, nothing to worry about.

06:40.814 --> 06:42.981
Okay.
I'm just surprised.

06:43.016 --> 06:45.284
He never mentioned a trip.

06:45.319 --> 06:48.220
If it's any consolation,
he left me in the lurch, too.

06:48.255 --> 06:49.321
We had plans today.

06:49.356 --> 06:50.455
Oh.

06:50.491 --> 06:51.790
Any chance you want to come

06:51.825 --> 06:54.125
to a charity lunch
with me today?

06:54.161 --> 06:56.761
Look, I know
you were hoping for Kyle,

06:56.797 --> 06:59.397
but honestly,
I'm much better company.

06:59.432 --> 07:00.832
No doubt.
It's just...

07:00.867 --> 07:02.967
Eh, eh, eh.
You're going to love it.

07:03.003 --> 07:04.402
It's 1,000 bucks a plate,

07:04.437 --> 07:06.470
and you don't
have to pay a nickel.

07:06.506 --> 07:08.239
1,000 bucks a plate?

07:08.274 --> 07:11.409
I mean, chump change
for you and me.

07:11.444 --> 07:12.443
But still.

07:12.478 --> 07:13.911
Mario Batali is catering.

07:13.946 --> 07:15.313
Oh, and the gift bags.

07:15.348 --> 07:18.015
And last year's door prize
was trip to Barcelona.

07:18.050 --> 07:19.250
Oh, my God!

07:19.285 --> 07:21.151
Is that a yes, then?

07:21.187 --> 07:22.653
That's a hell yes!

07:22.689 --> 07:23.987
Wonderful.

07:24.023 --> 07:26.857
Being in my circle
has its perks, Zoila.

07:26.892 --> 07:27.991
You'll see.

07:30.196 --> 07:32.662
It's lovely of you
to check on me, Marisol,

07:32.698 --> 07:33.931
but I am fine.

07:33.966 --> 07:35.532
Oh, well,
divorce is never easy,

07:35.567 --> 07:37.601
so if there's anything
you need...

07:37.636 --> 07:39.002
Aren't you sweet?

07:39.038 --> 07:40.170
Thank you.

07:40.206 --> 07:42.305
Oh, you smell amazing!

07:42.341 --> 07:43.973
I just had a detox massage.

07:44.008 --> 07:46.343
Lemon grass, coconut oil,
and jojoba.

07:46.378 --> 07:49.846
I don't know what jojoba is,
but it sure is a hoot to say.

07:49.881 --> 07:51.981
Jojoba.
[Cell phone vibrates]

07:52.016 --> 07:53.516
If it's not completely obvious,

07:53.552 --> 07:55.852
they allowed me to drink vodka
during my detox massage.

07:55.887 --> 07:57.454
Unbelievable.

07:57.489 --> 08:00.389
Another one of my maids
was just fired from her job.

08:00.424 --> 08:02.291
That is the third one today.

08:02.326 --> 08:03.492
What a shame.

08:03.527 --> 08:05.728
I know this might sound crazy,

08:05.764 --> 08:08.965
but I think Genevieve Delatour
is behind it.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.699
Oh, don't be silly.
Of course she's behind it.

08:10.735 --> 08:14.137
You're dating her ex.
She put a fatwa out on you.

08:14.172 --> 08:15.537
- A fatwa?
- Oh, yes.

08:15.573 --> 08:17.406
You are persona non Grata
in Beverly Hills.

08:17.441 --> 08:19.675
It's a risk for me
to even be talking to you.

08:19.710 --> 08:20.909
[Knocks on door]

08:20.944 --> 08:22.478
You weren't followed, were you?

08:22.513 --> 08:24.380
Stop that.

08:26.083 --> 08:28.717
It's just the hotel manager.
I'll only be a moment.

08:30.554 --> 08:31.520
Hello, Theodore.

08:31.555 --> 08:32.988
Mrs. Powell.

08:33.023 --> 08:35.056
I need to speak with you
about a sensitive matter.

08:35.092 --> 08:36.724
Before you say anything,

08:36.760 --> 08:38.426
that massage therapist
placed my hand there himself.

08:38.461 --> 08:40.361
No, no.
It's not that.

08:40.397 --> 08:44.265
Mrs. Powell, the credit card
we have for you has been...

08:44.301 --> 08:45.267
declined.

08:45.302 --> 08:46.868
Declined?
I'm sorry.

08:46.904 --> 08:49.236
I'm not familiar
