WEBVTT

00:32.449 --> 00:34.586
This is for the best.

02:20.958 --> 02:22.036
Brought you something to eat.

02:22.060 --> 02:23.527
Aren't you hungry?

02:29.701 --> 02:31.135
You need to let me go.

02:31.169 --> 02:32.603
Made you a sandwich.

02:32.637 --> 02:35.606
Look, I know I said
a lot of things

02:35.640 --> 02:37.374
the last time that you were
down here.

02:37.407 --> 02:38.710
You yelled at me.

02:38.743 --> 02:41.545
And... and I threatened
a lot of things, okay?

02:41.579 --> 02:43.681
I know, but I was upset.

02:45.016 --> 02:46.184
And why wouldn't I be?

02:46.216 --> 02:49.120
I woke up chained to a wall.

02:50.154 --> 02:53.958
Look, I'm trying to
stay calm here.

02:53.991 --> 02:56.694
I know you said that there was
good reason for all of this,

02:56.728 --> 02:59.897
so let's be reasonable, okay?

02:59.931 --> 03:02.232
I promise, if you let me go,

03:02.265 --> 03:03.568
I won't get mad.

03:03.601 --> 03:05.636
I... I won't tell anyone
what you did,

03:05.670 --> 03:07.572
it'll just be our little secret.

03:07.605 --> 03:08.873
Okay? I promise.

03:08.906 --> 03:10.383
Cut the crusts off,
just like you like it.

03:10.407 --> 03:12.744
Okay, look, you are
completely mistaken.

03:12.777 --> 03:14.344
I am not crazy.

03:14.377 --> 03:17.547
You have no right keeping me
chained up down here like this.

03:17.582 --> 03:19.516
Look, there's fruit cocktail
with three cherries.

03:19.549 --> 03:21.427
- Please come sit down and eat.
- Please listen to me,

03:21.451 --> 03:24.589
I never, ever killed anybody.
Okay?

03:24.622 --> 03:27.892
And certainly not my son,
since I've never even had kids.

03:28.291 --> 03:29.694
I've never even been married.

03:29.727 --> 03:31.662
Don't have to be married
to have kids.

03:37.101 --> 03:39.704
You do realize how crazy this
makes you look though, right?

03:39.737 --> 03:40.781
'Cause I said you had a child?

03:40.805 --> 03:42.940
Please! Among other things.

03:42.974 --> 03:44.942
Like this.

03:46.043 --> 03:47.879
Or, by the way, where
the fuck is this place

03:47.912 --> 03:49.446
to even begin with?

03:49.479 --> 03:52.349
I understand that you don't
want the police to find me,

03:52.382 --> 03:53.459
but you're the one
who's gonna have

03:53.483 --> 03:55.285
all of the explaining to do.

03:55.318 --> 03:56.888
You've made a terrible mistake.

03:56.921 --> 03:58.890
You're too thin to begin with.

03:58.923 --> 04:00.858
Sit down and eat.

04:00.892 --> 04:03.094
Are you even listening to me?

04:06.429 --> 04:07.865
Get away from me.

04:07.899 --> 04:09.934
Stop that.

04:09.967 --> 04:12.570
You keep this up and
there will be consequences.

04:13.805 --> 04:17.074
And just because
you don't believe me,

04:17.108 --> 04:19.277
you have caused
a lot of trouble already.

04:19.309 --> 04:20.878
Are you kidding me?

04:20.912 --> 04:23.881
I tortured my rag dolls with
less imagination than this.

04:25.650 --> 04:27.919
You need to let me go.

04:27.952 --> 04:29.053
Right now.

04:31.454 --> 04:33.825
Get... I can do it myself.

04:36.160 --> 04:38.963
Eat. I don't want you to
starve to death

04:38.996 --> 04:41.498
on top of everything else
going on around here.

05:04.555 --> 05:05.590
Fine.

05:06.489 --> 05:07.992
Suit yourself.

05:09.794 --> 05:12.296
Crazy fucking bitch!

05:14.531 --> 05:17.335
Let me out of here!

05:41.359 --> 05:43.561
Next time you pull
a stunt like this,

05:43.594 --> 05:45.730
you're cleaning it up yourself.

05:48.065 --> 05:50.768
Look at this mess, Claire.

05:53.070 --> 05:56.473
You gotta clean, so otherwise
you're gonna have bugs,

05:56.506 --> 05:58.809
mice, even rats.

05:58.843 --> 06:00.845
They carry disease, you know,

06:00.878 --> 06:02.713
very unhealthy roommates.

06:03.781 --> 06:04.815
Set traps.

06:05.850 --> 06:07.551
You're good at caging things.

06:07.585 --> 06:10.688
I think we've had enough
killing for awhile, don't you?

06:10.721 --> 06:12.623
I didn't kill anybody.

06:16.093 --> 06:17.128
Uh-huh.

06:17.728 --> 06:19.462
Not for a while, you haven't.

06:25.970 --> 06:27.772
Crazy fucking bitch!

07:50.788 --> 07:52.990
Claire.

08:05.803 --> 08:07.605
Claire.

08:12.143 --> 08:13.177
Claire.

08:32.530 --> 08:34.965
So, we feeling better now?

08:39.503 --> 08:41.472
I keep hearing voices.

08:41.739 --> 08:43.507
What's unusual about that?

08:43.541 --> 08:45.309
Been doing that your whole life.

08:45.342 --> 08:46.911
And if you're hungry,

08:46.944 --> 08:49.080
you can't blame this on me.

08:49.947 --> 08:52.817
I'm not the one throwing
good food all over the place.

08:54.385 --> 08:56.220
So...

08:56.253 --> 08:57.655
Wanna try again?

08:57.688 --> 08:58.722
Hm?

10:22.773 --> 10:24.008
Still not hungry?

10:57.508 --> 10:58.542
Claire.

10:59.877 --> 11:01.278
Claire.

11:01.312 --> 11:04.649
Get off of me.

11:14.258 --> 11:15.893
You should've let me help you.

12:19.390 --> 12:21.693
Ah, door sticks on me sometimes.

12:22.761 --> 12:24.895
You look like you've seen
a ghost,

12:24.928 --> 12:26.030
or the boogeyman.

12:27.831 --> 12:30.834
I forgot.
You do see those things.

12:32.771 --> 12:35.105
Not even the boogeyman
would come down here.

12:37.141 --> 12:38.876
And what is that smell?

12:38.909 --> 12:40.911
It smells like
something's rotting.

12:40.944 --> 12:43.581
I assure you, I cleaned
this place thoroughly.

12:43.615 --> 12:45.949
It's important that you're
as comfortable as possible

12:45.983 --> 12:47.652
until we can resolve this thing.

12:47.686 --> 12:50.387
The only acceptable resolution
is letting me go.

12:50.421 --> 12:52.489
Don't kid yourself, Claire.

12:52.523 --> 12:54.759
They're gonna be
looking for you.

12:54.793 --> 12:56.894
They will come after you.

12:56.927 --> 13:00.665
If "they" have any business
with anyone, it's with you.

13:00.699 --> 13:02.132
For good reason.

13:04.602 --> 13:06.337
Trust me,

13:06.370 --> 13:08.339
you don't want them
finding either of us

13:08.372 --> 13:09.440
at this point.

13:09.473 --> 13:11.676
Go ahead.
Let's test that theory.

13:11.710 --> 13:14.278
Call 911, have the police
come down here.

13:14.311 --> 13:16.189
- Let's see what happens.
- It's out of my hands now.

13:16.213 --> 13:17.682
Bullshit.

13:17.716 --> 13:21.151
Your circumstances are
entirely your own doing, Claire.

13:21.185 --> 13:23.120
I didn't kill anyone, Helen.

13:23.153 --> 13:25.489
I think I would remember
something like that.

13:25.522 --> 13:29.360
Well, it's probably less painful
to lock memories away.

13:29.393 --> 13:31.428
Put 'em in a room
you can't get into.

13:32.996 --> 13:34.865
Shove 'em under the bed,
so to speak.

13:35.800 --> 13:38.502
Dr. Kramer, he called it
repressed memory.

13:38.535 --> 13:40.672
- What?
- Me, I think

13:40.705 --> 13:43.641
there's a generous dose of
delusion in there as well.

13:43.675 --> 13:45.142
What's Kramer?

13:45.175 --> 13:46.343
You know Kramer.

13:47.511 --> 13:50.180
The psychiatric hospital
I was a nurse at?

13:50.214 --> 13:53.217
Where I went to work when you
first became a resident there?

13:55.185 --> 13:56.821
Thursdays.

13:56.855 --> 13:58.623
Thursday was jell-o day.

13:58.656 --> 14:00.157
And you always wanted red

14:00.190 --> 14:01.659
because you thought
it was cherry,

14:01.693 --> 14:03.394
even though it was strawberry.

14:03.427 --> 14:05.028
None of this is ringing a bell
up here?

14:05.062 --> 14:06.865
Not even a hint of one.

14:06.897 --> 14:08.542
Sure you weren't
the patient instead of me?

14:08.566 --> 14:10.200
You know,

14:10.234 --> 14:13.237
I learned an awful lot
working there,

14:13.270 --> 14:16.340
an awful lot about psychoses
and mental problems,

14:16.373 --> 14:19.543
which is why I'm the best
person to help you here.

14:19.577 --> 14:21.211
I think I'm in more of a need

14:21.245 --> 14:23.882
of a locksmith than
a nurse right now.

14:23.914 --> 14:25.149
But thanks.

14:25.182 --> 14:26.950
It's likely too late for either.

14:28.018 --> 14:29.721
You are in deep trouble,
my dear.

14:29.754 --> 14:31.321
Why do you keep saying that?

14:31.355 --> 14:34.659
Okay, I, I'm not insane,
and I didn't kill anybody.

14:34.692 --> 14:35.993
I wish that were true,

14:37.528 --> 14:38.663
I truly do.

14:39.597 --> 14:42.332
But somewhere deep inside,
you know it too.

14:44.268 --> 14:46.871
And you know that
you need my help.

14:46.905 --> 14:49.674
This is your idea of help?

14:49.707 --> 14:51.876
You're really
scraping the bottom

14:51.910 --> 14:53.410
of the idea bin there, Helen.

14:54.978 --> 14:57.715
You're not just delusional,
Claire.

14:57.749 --> 14:58.949
You're violent.

15:00.618 --> 15:03.153
Maybe beyond hope or help
at this point.

15:06.825 --> 15:07.958
I don't know.

15:09.561 --> 15:12.429
Maybe it was wrong for me
to take that job at Kramer.

15:14.164 --> 15:15.667
I just wanted to be near you.

15:17.334 --> 15:20.137
But it is so hard to watch
your only child

15:20.170 --> 15:22.874
have one mental breakdown
after another.

15:24.576 --> 15:27.679
Especially since it doesn't
seem to have helped at all.

15:29.246 --> 15:31.281
This...

15:32.516 --> 15:34.051
Is necessary.

15:36.754 --> 15:38.155
And you're just gonna have to

15:38.188 --> 15:40.224
get used to your situation
for a while.

15:41.593 --> 15:43.795
And just because
you don't believe me

15:43.828 --> 15:45.563
does not mean it's not true.

15:46.497 --> 15:48.465
Now, you need to eat
some supper.

15:48.499 --> 15:49.910
You haven't eaten in
a couple of days,

15:49.934 --> 15:51.268
and you've gotta be starving.

15:51.301 --> 15:52.336
Helen.

15:54.973 --> 15:57.074
I will get out of here.

15:57.107 --> 15:58.743
Of course you will, my dear.

15:59.042 --> 16:01.111
One day, one way or another,

16:01.144 --> 16:03.146
we all leave every place now,
don't we?

16:06.885 --> 16:09.486
By the way,
I would appreciate it

16:09.520 --> 16:11.154
if you didn't call me Helen.

16:12.356 --> 16:14.926
As I have told you
countless times...

16:17.394 --> 16:18.730
I prefer mom.

16:26.370 --> 16:29.007
Mom.

16:39.017 --> 16:41.819
<i>You're not
just delusional, Claire,</i>

16:41.853 --> 16:43.453
<i>you're violent.</i>

16:43.487 --> 16:46.024
<i>Maybe beyond hope or help
at this point.</i>

16:49.727 --> 16:51.729
I'm not crazy.

16:53.096 --> 16:54.298
I'm not crazy.

16:57.167 --> 16:59.469
I'm not crazy.

17:20.390 --> 17:22.092
What the fuck is that?

17:32.070 --> 17:33.071
Helen.

17:36.139 --> 17:37.842
Did you let somebody down here?

17:48.786 --> 17:50.755
Who the fuck are you?

17:56.761 --> 17:59.162
Stay the fuck away from me.

18:00.497 --> 18:01.531
Helen!

18:03.400 --> 18:05.469
I have a knife
under that pillow.

18:07.839 --> 18:08.873
Mom!

18:10.675 --> 18:12.542
Get away from me!

18:18.448 --> 18:19.483
Mo...

18:26.156 --> 18:27.190
Good morning.

18:28.258 --> 18:29.794
Or should I say good afternoon?

18:29.827 --> 18:31.996
It's past 12:30.

18:32.030 --> 18:33.564
Couldn't you sleep last night?

18:34.966 --> 18:37.068
It's hard to sleep when
you have an audience.

18:37.869 --> 18:39.369
There was a man down here

18:39.403 --> 18:41.839
standing right over there,
watching me.

18:44.441 --> 18:46.443
Please tell me that
you know who he is.

18:46.476 --> 18:48.412
I mean, as creepy as it is
that you would

18:48.445 --> 18:49.747
turn me into some peep show,

18:49.781 --> 18:50.858
it would be
a hell of a lot worse

18:50.882 --> 18:52.092
if there were people
in your house

18:52.116 --> 18:53.316
without you knowing it.

18:55.019 --> 18:56.319
So why didn't you call me, then?

18:56.353 --> 18:58.823
I did call you.
I yelled actually.

18:58.856 --> 19:01.159
You called for me
while some strange guy

19:01.191 --> 19:03.326
was standing over there
watching you?

19:03.360 --> 19:06.130
Yes, I did yell, out loud,

19:06.164 --> 19:09.667
and there was a man
standing there staring at me.

19:10.902 --> 19:12.937
Well, I'm sure you believe that,

19:12.970 --> 19:15.205
but I keep all the doors
and windows locked, so...

19:15.238 --> 19:17.175
I didn't fucking imagine him.

19:19.911 --> 19:21.879
Just so we're clear,

19:21.913 --> 19:24.649
I do not appreciate
that language.

19:24.682 --> 19:25.717
Tough shit.

19:26.316 --> 19:29.453
Speaking of that.

19:29.486 --> 19:31.689
Whew! Gettin' ripe.

19:33.356 --> 19:35.960
What you're smelling
isn't in there. Okay?

19:35.993 --> 19:37.327
The stench was in this room

19:37.360 --> 19:39.396
long before I did
any of that business.

19:40.598 --> 19:42.033
Coffee and a sandwich.

19:44.334 --> 19:46.738
Which would be a hell of
a lot easier to stomach

19:46.771 --> 19:50.208
if we could figure out
what the stench actually is.

19:54.178 --> 19:57.247
Do you hear anything
that I say to you?

20:13.564 --> 20:14.766
She wakes.

20:19.937 --> 20:21.906
I'd say, rise and shine, but...

20:22.573 --> 20:24.407
The sun never gets in here,
does it?

20:26.878 --> 20:28.112
You look scared.

20:29.647 --> 20:33.618
So, what's a girl like you
doing in a place like this?

20:34.619 --> 20:35.653
Are you...

20:38.923 --> 20:41.291
I need to get out of here.
Can you help me?

20:42.059 --> 20:44.394
- That depends.
- On what?

20:44.427 --> 20:46.463
On you.

20:47.131 --> 20:49.200
- How did you...
- I'm not real, Claire.

20:50.101 --> 20:52.469
And popping around like this
might seem like a bit much,

20:52.502 --> 20:55.273
but it spares us
a lengthy debate about

20:55.305 --> 20:57.742
whether or not your mother
put me up to being down here.

20:57.775 --> 20:59.777
How is it that you
know about Helen?

20:59.811 --> 21:01.779
Or... or the fact that
she's my mother?

21:02.914 --> 21:04.148
Because you do.

21:04.182 --> 21:07.785
And if I'm a figment
of your imagination...

21:07.819 --> 21:08.853
Oh, no.

21:10.121 --> 21:12.590
- Maybe I am crazy.
- Now, why do you say that?

21:12.623 --> 21:14.592
Didn't you ever have
an imaginary friend as a kid?

21:14.625 --> 21:16.661
I'm not a kid anymore.

21:16.694 --> 21:18.229
Maybe you're just dreaming.

21:19.429 --> 21:21.331
And I don't need
an imaginary friend.

21:21.364 --> 21:22.465
Beats being crazy.

21:23.533 --> 21:24.778
I think if I were dreaming this,

21:24.802 --> 21:27.004
I'd be waking up in a hurry.

21:27.038 --> 21:30.942
The isolation alone is
enough to make anyone go mad.

21:30.975 --> 21:33.476
I mean, look at this place.

21:34.812 --> 21:35.980
How depressing.

21:36.948 --> 21:38.850
I think if I were a mouse
living here,

21:40.117 --> 21:41.652
I'd kill myself.

21:41.686 --> 21:44.421
I think a few dozen
of them already have.

21:44.454 --> 21:45.990
That would explain the smell.

21:46.023 --> 21:47.357
Dream or no dream,

21:47.390 --> 21:49.327
I think I'd welcome
someone to talk to,

21:49.359 --> 21:51.896
even if they were a
figment of my imagination.

21:52.964 --> 21:54.364
So I made you up?

21:54.732 --> 21:56.334
I don't know, did you?

21:56.366 --> 21:58.769
I'd at least think that I'd
make up someone less annoying.

21:58.803 --> 22:00.137
Don't worry, Claire,

22:00.171 --> 22:01.839
I was always a smartass.

22:02.907 --> 22:05.042
And that's not dead mice
that you're smelling.

22:05.408 --> 22:06.644
Then what is it?

22:06.677 --> 22:08.713
You know, you really should
try to eat.

22:08.746 --> 22:10.781
That pain in your gut
is not pretend,

22:10.815 --> 22:12.149
and it's only gonna get worse.

22:12.183 --> 22:14.352
If you are a figment of
my imagination,

22:14.384 --> 22:15.653
then go away.

22:15.686 --> 22:17.188
I don't need somebody
to chat with,

22:17.221 --> 22:19.199
I need to figure out a way
to get the hell out of here.

22:19.223 --> 22:21.192
Sorry, I can't help you
with that.

22:21.225 --> 22:23.393
We all have rules, Claire.

22:23.426 --> 22:24.571
It's just how
the universe works.

22:24.595 --> 22:25.897
Then what good are you?

22:28.766 --> 22:29.800
Whoever you are.

22:31.602 --> 22:33.037
My name is Rebecca.

22:36.874 --> 22:38.142
Who you talkin' to?

22:39.377 --> 22:41.846
Another visit from your
gentleman admirer?

22:41.879 --> 22:44.181
No, this one was a woman.

22:44.215 --> 22:47.585
Oh, conjured up
another one, huh?

22:47.618 --> 22:49.921
I wish you were a
figment of my imagination.

22:49.954 --> 22:53.423
Be very careful
what you wish for, my dear.

23:29.760 --> 23:30.995
Helen?

23:49.814 --> 23:50.848
Helen?

24:57.882 --> 24:59.150
What are you, a janitor now?

24:59.183 --> 25:00.217
Strip.

25:01.585 --> 25:03.054
Excuse me?

25:03.087 --> 25:05.656
I said, strip.

25:05.689 --> 25:07.358
No fucking way.

25:07.391 --> 25:10.661
Claire, good hygiene
is important.

25:10.694 --> 25:13.564
A good mother knows how
to take care of her child,

25:13.597 --> 25:14.632
as you know.

25:43.260 --> 25:44.695
Claire.

25:47.298 --> 25:49.233
How the fuck did you
get down here?

25:49.633 --> 25:50.668
Helen!

25:52.603 --> 25:54.105
Stay away.

25:54.138 --> 25:55.272
Helen!

25:55.773 --> 25:57.408
We were so happy.

25:58.309 --> 25:59.777
So happy.

26:02.146 --> 26:03.757
And then there was that
knock on the door.

26:03.781 --> 26:05.749
Darn thing.

26:05.783 --> 26:06.951
What's wrong?

26:06.984 --> 26:09.620
That fucking guy, he's back.

26:09.653 --> 26:10.688
What guy?

26:12.656 --> 26:13.858
No, no, no, no, no.

26:13.891 --> 26:15.626
No, no, no, there-there
was someone here,

26:15.659 --> 26:16.827
I swear.

26:17.828 --> 26:18.863
I swear.

26:19.997 --> 26:21.799
There's nobody there.

26:24.569 --> 26:27.638
Honey, do you remember
what we talked about before?

26:27.671 --> 26:28.806
I'm not crazy.

26:30.007 --> 26:32.710
I'm talking about the language.

26:32.743 --> 26:36.914
Look, you're just grumpy.
Lay down. Just lay down.

26:36.947 --> 26:38.849
Get some sleep,
you'll feel better.

26:40.184 --> 26:42.119
And you need to eat.

26:42.153 --> 26:44.522
You've gotta be starving
at this point.

26:58.802 --> 27:00.371
So much better.

28:37.034 --> 28:38.034
Mommy!

29:50.274 --> 29:53.043
A mommy's love never dies.

29:56.480 --> 29:57.514
My ball.

30:06.957 --> 30:08.525
Mommies are so important,
aren't they?

30:09.860 --> 30:12.831
Mommies do all kinds
of nice things for us.

30:12.863 --> 30:16.166
They feed us,
they wash our bodies,

30:16.200 --> 30:18.168
they chain us up.

30:19.336 --> 30:20.904
Your mommy loves you.

30:22.506 --> 30:25.342
And a mommy's love is forever.

30:26.076 --> 30:27.978
<i>Forever.</i>

30:28.011 --> 30:29.046
<i>Forever.</i>

30:45.830 --> 30:47.297
How can you eat that stuff?

30:48.499 --> 30:50.534
You're the one
that told me to eat.

30:50.568 --> 30:52.570
You're just imagining that.

30:52.604 --> 30:54.706
Staring at that bowl
isn't gonna help you.

30:56.240 --> 30:57.541
I don't like oatmeal.

30:58.175 --> 31:00.812
When was the last
time that you ate anything?

31:00.845 --> 31:01.880
I can't remember.

31:02.881 --> 31:05.850
I can't remember anything
except this room.

31:05.884 --> 31:09.420
My past,
my entire life is a blank,

31:11.890 --> 31:13.123
I don't know why.

31:13.924 --> 31:15.225
Helen, she...

31:15.259 --> 31:17.562
Mothers can be such a pain.

31:18.429 --> 31:20.330
Especially when they're
always around.

31:21.965 --> 31:23.768
Don't you want to
get out of here, Claire?

31:24.268 --> 31:26.270
You can't be enjoying this.

31:26.303 --> 31:27.672
What's not to love?

31:27.705 --> 31:29.674
Now who's being a smartass?

31:32.309 --> 31:34.111
Helen says that
I've hurt people.

31:35.112 --> 31:37.347
She says I killed a couple,

31:37.381 --> 31:40.685
a man and his wife
and... and a little boy.

31:40.718 --> 31:42.119
Did you?

31:42.152 --> 31:43.187
I can't remember.

31:44.221 --> 31:45.289
I don't remember.

31:46.658 --> 31:48.067
It doesn't sound like
something I would do,

31:48.091 --> 31:49.761
so I find it hard to believe.

31:50.628 --> 31:52.630
But, then again, I'm
talking to you right now,

31:52.664 --> 31:55.299
so maybe my brain isn't
working so well lately.

31:58.570 --> 32:00.905
Slaughtered a family.

32:00.939 --> 32:02.807
Now why would you do
something like that?

32:02.841 --> 32:04.074
I would really like to know.

32:04.107 --> 32:05.810
No, no, no, that's
what Helen says I did,

32:05.844 --> 32:08.212
not something that
I remember doing.

32:08.245 --> 32:09.989
But she also said that
there was a little boy.

32:10.013 --> 32:12.717
I mean, how the hell do you
forget something like that?

32:12.851 --> 32:15.152
I couldn't kill anybody,
I can't even squash a bug.

32:15.185 --> 32:18.188
You know, it's really amazing
what people are capable of.

32:19.591 --> 32:21.058
It's not like the movies.

32:21.091 --> 32:23.494
You know, in the movies,
the bad guy is bad all the time,

32:23.527 --> 32:26.129
and the good guy is always good,

32:26.163 --> 32:27.866
but real people
aren't like that.

32:29.132 --> 32:31.201
Good and evil exists
in all of us.

32:32.369 --> 32:35.005
It just depends which one
was nurtured the most.

32:35.038 --> 32:38.242
Or which one surfaced first
in a particular situation.

32:41.846 --> 32:44.248
Maybe your bad guy
showed up at the wrong time.

32:44.448 --> 32:46.283
- That's nonsense.
- Okay, fine.

32:46.316 --> 32:48.519
Let's try to
figure this out, then.

32:48.553 --> 32:50.187
When did you supposedly
do this thing?

32:50.220 --> 32:51.756
I told you, I don't remember.

32:51.789 --> 32:53.190
Well, there you go.

32:53.223 --> 32:54.358
If you did do it,

32:54.391 --> 32:56.260
don't you think
you would remember?

32:56.293 --> 32:57.929
Somewhere deep inside yourself?

32:57.962 --> 33:00.030
- I don't know.
- You don't know...

33:00.832 --> 33:03.534
If you would remember
committing this horrible crime?

33:05.637 --> 33:08.940
Wouldn't it still be there
like some bad aftertaste?

33:08.973 --> 33:10.374
Helen says that the psychiatrist

33:10.407 --> 33:11.685
said that I've repressed
the memory, I...

33:11.709 --> 33:14.012
The psychiatrist said.

33:14.044 --> 33:15.279
Psychiatrists don't even know

33:15.312 --> 33:16.912
what they're talking about
half the time.

33:17.514 --> 33:19.149
So much goes on
in people's heads...

33:19.182 --> 33:22.052
Love, hate, fear...

33:22.085 --> 33:23.353
Sorrow.

33:24.889 --> 33:26.123
Anger.

33:27.992 --> 33:29.961
The desire to hurt,

33:29.994 --> 33:32.630
to lash out at someone
that we think has hurt us.

33:33.565 --> 33:34.799
It's a constant dogfight,

33:34.832 --> 33:36.768
each emotion trying to conquer
the other.

33:38.101 --> 33:40.537
If you really want to
get outta here,

33:40.572 --> 33:42.506
you've gotta do more
than just shout or cry.

33:42.539 --> 33:44.207
You've gotta fight for it.

33:44.241 --> 33:46.978
You have to figure out
what is real.

33:47.011 --> 33:49.346
A reality check.

33:49.379 --> 33:51.214
That's pretty rich
coming from you.

33:52.082 --> 33:54.052
Then maybe you do really
belong here.

33:57.722 --> 33:59.657
Wherever here is.

34:55.613 --> 34:57.381
I see you.

35:03.688 --> 35:05.657
I don't remember anything.

35:07.592 --> 35:09.894
And all of these ifs are
just making it worse.

35:10.795 --> 35:13.131
But there is something
in the back of my mind.

35:14.966 --> 35:17.001
I can hear these voices,
but they're far off,

35:17.035 --> 35:19.837
like everything's locked
behind some heavy door...

35:21.204 --> 35:22.472
And I can't find the key.

35:22.506 --> 35:24.341
Dig deeper, Claire.

35:24.374 --> 35:25.686
You need to remember
what happened.

35:25.710 --> 35:27.145
What if nothing happened?

35:28.445 --> 35:30.682
You wouldn't be here
if nothing happened.

35:36.054 --> 35:38.355
Still no appetite, huh?

35:38.388 --> 35:39.757
Oh, I still have an appetite.

35:40.658 --> 35:41.726
Just not for that.

35:43.728 --> 35:46.964
How is it that
I remember my name...

35:46.998 --> 35:48.166
Remember you,

35:48.198 --> 35:50.068
but I don't remember
killing anybody?

35:51.201 --> 35:53.771
- I've told you...
- Or this place.

35:53.805 --> 35:57.274
If you live here, then I
probably grew up here, right?

35:57.575 --> 35:59.276
But I don't remember
any of this.

36:00.477 --> 36:01.646
Like... like this bed.

36:01.679 --> 36:03.715
Where the hell
did this come from?

36:05.315 --> 36:07.952
None of this even remotely
begins to scratch the itch.

36:07.985 --> 36:09.654
Well, it's probably
better that way.

36:09.687 --> 36:10.888
You know?

36:10.922 --> 36:14.025
It's understandable.
It's a lot less painful.

36:15.159 --> 36:16.526
Then why do I remember you?

36:19.197 --> 36:21.364
Don't want to dignify that
with a response?

36:21.398 --> 36:23.568
Fine. Then answer me this.

36:23.601 --> 36:25.636
How long do I have to
stay down here?

36:26.436 --> 36:27.504
Until you can leave.

36:27.537 --> 36:29.506
And just when will that be, huh?

36:29.539 --> 36:31.709
- Answer me.
- It is not up to me.

36:31.743 --> 36:33.044
Really?

36:33.077 --> 36:34.757
You're the one that's
keeping me down here.

36:36.013 --> 36:37.915
Is that what you think?

36:37.949 --> 36:39.684
You're not the one
keeping me down here?

36:41.052 --> 36:43.755
Good. Then take this thing off.

36:44.722 --> 36:46.724
Really, mom. Prove to me that

36:46.758 --> 36:48.693
you're not the one keeping me
against my will,

36:48.726 --> 36:50.327
and take it off.

36:52.063 --> 36:53.898
What, nothing to say?

36:55.066 --> 36:56.934
No smug little comeback?

36:58.035 --> 37:01.005
I'm calling you out on
your bullshit, Helen.

37:01.038 --> 37:03.808
When did I ever say
that this was my house?

37:15.385 --> 37:17.088
Stupid bitch!

37:18.556 --> 37:19.590
Let me out of here!

37:32.270 --> 37:33.303
Brought you some tea.

37:34.138 --> 37:35.173
I don't want it.

37:36.841 --> 37:37.875
Fine.

37:38.810 --> 37:41.279
So now you can die of
thirst as well as hunger.

37:41.311 --> 37:43.547
If this isn't our house,
then where are we?

37:44.514 --> 37:46.984
Well, you should know,
you brought me here.

37:47.018 --> 37:49.720
- I what?
- Yes, you sent an sos,

37:49.754 --> 37:52.557
and as usual,
mommy came running.

37:52.590 --> 37:53.991
If I was actually in trouble,

37:54.025 --> 37:55.726
you'd be the last person
that I'd call.

37:55.760 --> 38:00.463
Claire, you have been calling me
to bail you out forever.

38:02.166 --> 38:04.769
Back in school when you
were being picked on.

38:04.802 --> 38:08.272
When you got violent and you
broke that poor girl's nose.

38:08.306 --> 38:09.807
When you got pregnant
in college.

38:09.841 --> 38:11.676
Whoa, pregnant?

38:11.709 --> 38:14.645
No, no, no, no, Helen, I've
never been pregnant, okay?

38:14.679 --> 38:15.646
That's a pretty big deal.

38:15.680 --> 38:16.914
How the hell do you think

38:16.948 --> 38:18.916
I wouldn't remember
something like that?

38:18.950 --> 38:20.585
Let's face it, dear.

38:20.618 --> 38:21.686
You're a real screw up.

38:21.719 --> 38:23.120
And you're a heartless bitch.

38:23.154 --> 38:25.089
- Hey!
- Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry.

38:25.122 --> 38:26.456
I know, language.

38:26.489 --> 38:27.658
I meant,

38:27.692 --> 38:30.561
you're a heartless
fucking bitch.

38:40.071 --> 38:43.274
By the way,
this is our house now.

39:16.274 --> 39:19.043
Go away.

39:20.578 --> 39:22.246
Well, that's not very nice.

39:31.222 --> 39:32.924
Feeling sad, are we?

39:35.793 --> 39:36.827
Go away.

39:39.196 --> 39:40.765
Temper, temper.

39:43.801 --> 39:45.569
You know,
when I was a little kid,

39:46.436 --> 39:48.806
I got this doll for Christmas.

39:48.839 --> 39:51.275
It was supposed to look
like a real newborn baby,

39:51.309 --> 39:53.844
all wrinkly and everything,

39:54.745 --> 39:56.614
but I thought it was ugly.

39:56.647 --> 39:59.750
So I threw it in the toy box
and refused to play with it.

39:59.784 --> 40:01.686
Then eventually, I noticed
that it was missing,

40:01.719 --> 40:04.088
and I asked my mother about it,

40:04.121 --> 40:06.456
and she said that she
had given the doll away

40:06.489 --> 40:08.926
to a little girl
whose family was poor.

40:10.328 --> 40:14.265
She said that little girl
was grateful for the doll,

40:14.298 --> 40:15.399
and loved that doll.

40:15.433 --> 40:16.499
Interesting story.

40:19.469 --> 40:21.439
- I don't care.
- But after a while...

40:22.873 --> 40:26.577
It started to bug me,
started to really nag at me,

40:26.610 --> 40:28.279
taking up more and more
of my attention,

40:28.312 --> 40:30.348
until finally...

40:31.349 --> 40:33.317
It started making me mad.

40:34.618 --> 40:37.154
The more I thought about it,
the madder I got,

40:37.188 --> 40:39.223
until, I didn't even know
that little girl,

40:39.256 --> 40:41.759
but I hated that little girl.

40:41.792 --> 40:43.728
She had my doll.

40:43.761 --> 40:46.006
- Go away, Rebecca, please.
- There's a point to this story.

40:46.030 --> 40:47.841
- Do you not want to hear it?
- No, I really don't.

40:47.865 --> 40:49.667
I don't care, the point is,

40:49.700 --> 40:52.703
people don't appreciate things
until they're gone.

40:53.536 --> 40:56.040
And trying to get back
something that you've lost...

40:57.842 --> 40:59.577
Is like trying to climb
a waterfall.

40:59.610 --> 41:01.579
Just go away.

41:01.612 --> 41:04.547
I never tried to climb
that particular waterfall,

41:05.515 --> 41:07.318
but I wonder if I had...

41:08.953 --> 41:11.055
What it would've done to
that little girl.

41:12.356 --> 41:13.924
Would it have changed her life?

41:15.525 --> 41:17.395
And what kind of change
would that have been?

41:18.496 --> 41:20.698
Bad, I suppose.

41:21.632 --> 41:22.867
After all,

41:22.900 --> 41:25.002
she loved that doll
more than I ever did.

41:27.537 --> 41:30.007
But what if I had
gone back for it,

41:30.041 --> 41:31.575
taken it away from her?

41:33.377 --> 41:35.046
What would that
have done to her?

41:36.514 --> 41:38.516
And would it have been
temporary or permanent?

41:42.353 --> 41:44.121
It was just a doll.

41:48.059 --> 41:50.828
It's always "just" something
with you,

41:50.861 --> 41:52.096
isn't it, Claire?

42:02.807 --> 42:04.775
Hopefully, that bitch
can't throw her voice.

43:11.175 --> 43:12.510
What the fuck?

43:27.424 --> 43:28.993
Better take my number.

43:30.761 --> 43:32.997
Lot of demand for my attention
down here.

43:47.845 --> 43:48.913
What are you doing?

43:50.681 --> 43:52.249
Nothing.

43:52.283 --> 43:53.684
Talking to yourself again?

43:55.119 --> 43:56.921
That was cute
when you were little,

43:56.954 --> 43:59.323
you know, you and your
imaginary friends.

44:00.691 --> 44:02.594
But when you kept doing it
as you got older,

44:02.627 --> 44:05.162
that scared me, I gotta tell ya.

44:05.196 --> 44:06.897
Obviously, for good reason.

44:08.832 --> 44:09.900
All right.

44:10.834 --> 44:12.036
Cleaned your bucket,

44:12.069 --> 44:14.371
and I made you
a tuna sandwich for lunch.

44:14.405 --> 44:15.439
I hate tuna.

44:16.240 --> 44:18.242
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

44:19.143 --> 44:20.344
Well, I made you tuna.

44:20.377 --> 44:22.947
While you were cleaning my
shit bucket,

44:22.980 --> 44:24.882
so go make something else.

44:24.915 --> 44:26.383
Not a restaurant, Claire.

44:29.053 --> 44:31.455
Why do you keep bringing me
stuff that I hate?

44:31.989 --> 44:33.592
To starve you, of course.

44:35.726 --> 44:36.760
Enjoy.

44:39.330 --> 44:40.764
Enjoy.

44:44.501 --> 44:45.936
She has a point, you know.

44:46.837 --> 44:47.905
You probably are starving.

44:47.938 --> 44:49.708
Helen!

44:50.642 --> 44:53.043
Go away, my mother's calling
the police as we speak.

44:53.077 --> 44:54.878
Nobody's calling the police,
Claire.

44:54.912 --> 44:57.649
Go away. Helen!

44:57.682 --> 44:58.749
She can't hear you.

44:59.750 --> 45:01.161
But you haven't
figured that out, either.

45:01.185 --> 45:05.155
Just please go away,
I... I am tired of this shit.

45:05.522 --> 45:07.157
You've been sleeping plenty.

45:07.191 --> 45:09.594
If you're here to kill me,
then just get on with it.

45:09.628 --> 45:11.428
Otherwise, fuck off.

45:11.462 --> 45:12.763
Helen!

45:12.796 --> 45:13.931
You need to think, Claire.

45:13.964 --> 45:15.532
What are you, a friend?

45:15.567 --> 45:17.434
Or just some creep
doing this for kicks

45:17.468 --> 45:19.003
and a couple of bucks?

45:19.036 --> 45:21.772
You need to clear your mind
of all these distractions.

45:21.805 --> 45:23.049
'Cause if you wanted to kill me,

45:23.073 --> 45:24.942
then you'd at least be
holding a knife.

45:26.410 --> 45:27.845
Claire.

45:27.878 --> 45:29.947
Stay the fuck away from me.

45:31.882 --> 45:33.284
Helen!

45:33.317 --> 45:34.952
- Claire.
- Stay away!

45:34.985 --> 45:36.186
Go...

45:36.220 --> 45:38.422
Why does this keep
happening to me, mommy?

45:42.159 --> 45:45.262
All these scary people keep
doing scary things to me.

45:45.296 --> 45:46.430
What?

45:46.463 --> 45:48.899
Then you need to
make them leave.

45:48.932 --> 45:50.901
But I don't know how.

45:50.934 --> 45:52.637
Sure you do.

45:52.671 --> 45:54.639
You just need to remember.

46:08.986 --> 46:11.221
You haven't even touched
your lunch.

46:11.255 --> 46:13.692
I told you, I don't like tuna.

46:14.425 --> 46:16.661
You are going to
starve to death.

46:16.695 --> 46:17.961
I'm not hungry.

46:17.995 --> 46:20.598
Well, you haven't eaten
in days, so of course.

46:20.632 --> 46:23.635
Your body's stopped telling
your brain that you need food.

46:24.769 --> 46:27.504
Now it's just feeding on itself.

46:27.538 --> 46:30.374
You need to snap out of
this or you're gonna die.

46:32.109 --> 46:35.045
Or are you in a hurry to meet
your victims again this soon?

46:37.881 --> 46:40.150
You know you're a
terrible mother, right?

46:43.120 --> 46:48.092
If anyone knows about being
a terrible mother, it's you.

46:48.125 --> 46:50.494
Well, actually I don't.

46:50.527 --> 46:52.831
But if I did have kids...

46:54.465 --> 46:58.068
I wouldn't feed them
things they don't like.

47:02.940 --> 47:05.309
You have no idea

47:05.342 --> 47:07.911
what some people
are forced to swallow.

47:09.748 --> 47:12.851
Other people's choices
and other people's actions

47:12.883 --> 47:14.485
put you in a situation,

47:14.518 --> 47:16.520
and you have to deal with
the results

47:16.554 --> 47:18.288
that you had nothing to do with!

47:19.089 --> 47:21.693
Other people's selfish appetites

47:21.726 --> 47:23.394
intrude on your life,

47:23.427 --> 47:26.798
and suddenly you're chained
in a sea of darkness

47:26.831 --> 47:28.198
and stench and filth

47:28.232 --> 47:30.635
like you could never
have imagined.

47:33.003 --> 47:34.739
And it never ends.

47:34.773 --> 47:36.708
It just goes on and on,

47:36.741 --> 47:40.244
and it gets worse
and worse and worse.

47:46.417 --> 47:47.786
And here we are.

47:50.855 --> 47:52.891
Well, here I am.

47:54.525 --> 47:56.493
I know that you
have been imagining

47:56.527 --> 47:58.563
a lot of things lately, Claire.

48:00.632 --> 48:02.099
But this...

48:04.636 --> 48:09.006
Is absolutely fucking real!

48:17.948 --> 48:20.350
And I have always been
a good mother.

48:23.755 --> 48:25.690
Even when I wasn't
a good person.

49:26.784 --> 49:28.887
No.

49:29.954 --> 49:30.922
No.

49:30.955 --> 49:32.256
Shit.

51:08.151 --> 51:11.022
A mommy's love never dies.

51:52.130 --> 51:55.133
Well, you're not
much of a talker, are you?

51:58.435 --> 52:00.805
Oh my god, I'm losing
my fucking mind.

52:15.385 --> 52:18.221
Thought this might
cheer you up a little.

52:19.824 --> 52:22.192
I always say that nature
is a balm to the soul.

52:22.225 --> 52:23.995
You should've brought flowers.

52:24.028 --> 52:26.764
They would've at least
covered up the smell down here.

52:27.799 --> 52:29.533
And that's just gonna die,
you know.

52:29.567 --> 52:31.035
Oh, it'll be fine,

52:31.069 --> 52:33.571
all it needs is
a little water and tlc.

52:35.405 --> 52:37.374
- And food.
- No, Helen.

52:37.407 --> 52:39.443
Plants need
more than that, like light.

52:39.476 --> 52:41.612
It'll be fine for
a couple of days.

52:41.646 --> 52:43.513
And people need more
to survive, too,

52:43.547 --> 52:45.183
like hope and freedom.

52:46.684 --> 52:49.519
Honey, none of us
are ever truly free.

52:49.554 --> 52:51.189
I need something to do.

52:51.221 --> 52:52.322
What do you mean?

52:52.355 --> 52:54.025
I have been laying here
day after day.

52:54.058 --> 52:56.060
If I don't find something
to occupy my mind,

52:56.094 --> 52:57.962
then I actually will go crazy.

52:57.995 --> 52:59.329
Well, what do you want?

52:59.362 --> 53:00.330
I don't know, a laptop?

53:00.363 --> 53:02.734
- No.
- Okay, a tablet.

53:02.767 --> 53:03.835
No!

53:03.868 --> 53:05.603
Fine, a book, puzzle, anything.

53:07.404 --> 53:10.641
Aren't I being
a good girl now, mommy?

53:12.009 --> 53:13.044
No.

53:19.016 --> 53:21.819
You know, if you're bored,

53:21.853 --> 53:23.764
we could always just play
pin the tail on the ghost.

53:23.788 --> 53:25.156
Why do you keep showing up?

53:25.189 --> 53:26.591
I don't know,

53:26.624 --> 53:28.559
'cause you'd look crazy
talking to an empty room.

53:31.963 --> 53:33.497
I keep seeing a little boy.

53:40.403 --> 53:42.006
What's wrong, Claire?

53:42.039 --> 53:43.174
Nothing, I think, uh...

53:43.207 --> 53:44.976
I think I just need to lay down.

53:45.877 --> 53:47.087
The smell down here
is getting worse,

53:47.111 --> 53:49.180
it's giving me a headache.

53:49.213 --> 53:50.248
Feeling weak?

53:51.149 --> 53:52.183
Yeah.

53:52.650 --> 53:54.518
Not surprising.

53:54.551 --> 53:56.120
Why's that?

53:56.154 --> 53:58.256
You already know
the answer to that.

53:58.288 --> 54:00.423
- No, I don't.
- Sure you do.

54:00.457 --> 54:04.361
You're just not
thinking clearly.

54:05.328 --> 54:06.664
I wonder why that is.

54:07.932 --> 54:11.602
Are you really crazy?
Is it self-protection?

54:11.636 --> 54:14.538
Or is your body sapping
energy from your brain?

54:14.572 --> 54:16.607
You know, you're really
starting to piss me off.

54:17.575 --> 54:18.743
Go away.

54:18.776 --> 54:19.777
Did you ever read

54:19.811 --> 54:21.545
"the emperor's new clothes"?

54:22.412 --> 54:25.216
A shyster dressed the
emperor in nothing at all,

54:25.249 --> 54:28.719
but convinced him that
he was wearing the finest duds.

54:28.753 --> 54:30.755
The emperor deluded himself
into thinking

54:30.788 --> 54:33.390
he was walking around
wearing some pretty hot stuff,

54:33.423 --> 54:35.159
but he was actually naked.

54:36.794 --> 54:39.230
Everyone else goes along with it
because he's the emperor,

54:39.263 --> 54:42.300
so he could cut your head off,
you know, but...

54:42.332 --> 54:44.569
Someone finally got the courage

54:45.435 --> 54:47.305
to make him look in the mirror.

54:47.337 --> 54:49.640
Someone got him to turn around

54:49.674 --> 54:51.341
and see what was
really going on.

54:54.045 --> 54:55.045
You're naked, Claire.

54:56.948 --> 54:58.583
It's time to look in the mirror.

55:01.686 --> 55:03.287
You know, you show up here,

55:03.321 --> 55:04.755
and you share
your words of wisdom,

55:04.789 --> 55:06.824
and I have no idea what
you're talking about.

55:06.858 --> 55:09.827
And yet, if I'm a figment
of your imagination,

55:09.861 --> 55:12.362
it's all actually coming
from you, isn't it?

55:12.395 --> 55:13.430
Then again...

55:14.665 --> 55:17.101
What if I'm not a figment of
your imagination?

55:19.303 --> 55:20.905
Just go away, Rebecca.

55:30.314 --> 55:32.183
If only that worked on Helen.

55:47.999 --> 55:49.466
Claire.

55:51.235 --> 55:52.270
Mommy?

56:07.919 --> 56:09.787
No!

56:13.090 --> 56:14.558
No.

56:14.592 --> 56:15.660
Help!

56:43.621 --> 56:44.922
Claire.

57:23.027 --> 57:24.061
Helen?

57:30.301 --> 57:31.569
Mom!

57:36.506 --> 57:38.576
You have another visitor coming,

57:38.609 --> 57:40.478
he's just not here yet.

57:40.644 --> 57:42.545
But he is coming.

57:43.513 --> 57:45.683
He's coming very soon.

58:14.311 --> 58:16.080
You need to remember.

58:17.248 --> 58:18.883
Very soon.

58:22.486 --> 58:23.654
Claire.

59:12.571 --> 59:13.604
Hello?

59:28.219 --> 59:29.253
What do you want?

59:30.955 --> 59:32.591
Why do you keep coming here?

59:57.515 --> 59:58.549
Bad dreams?

1:00:13.264 --> 1:00:14.298
Claire.

1:00:15.266 --> 1:00:16.667
It's time to open that door.

1:00:19.604 --> 1:00:20.871
I'm so tired.

1:00:22.473 --> 1:00:24.942
It's time to look inside.

1:01:27.504 --> 1:01:28.539
Drink your tea.

1:01:32.343 --> 1:01:33.811
I keep seeing weird things.

1:01:37.181 --> 1:01:40.117
People keep coming down here
and tormenting me.

1:01:42.953 --> 1:01:43.988
I'm scared.

1:01:45.456 --> 1:01:47.091
No one has been here.

1:01:50.060 --> 1:01:51.996
Then why am I so afraid?

1:01:53.632 --> 1:01:55.966
I don't know. Why do you think?

1:01:58.202 --> 1:02:01.606
You have a lot of skeletons
in your closet, my dear.

1:03:07.706 --> 1:03:10.007
No, you're not real.

1:03:10.040 --> 1:03:12.309
Mommy loves me, so she said,

1:03:12.343 --> 1:03:14.478
right before she bashed my head.

1:03:14.511 --> 1:03:15.647
You're not real.

1:03:17.881 --> 1:03:19.784
But mommy's love will never die,

1:03:19.818 --> 1:03:21.919
she told me when she
made me cry.

1:03:27.224 --> 1:03:29.960
Stay away.

1:06:05.783 --> 1:06:07.150
My ball!

1:06:54.866 --> 1:06:56.034
Let go! Let go of me!

1:06:56.066 --> 1:06:57.306
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1:07:15.185 --> 1:07:16.520
Claire!

1:07:16.553 --> 1:07:18.022
Oh, my god, wake...

1:07:18.056 --> 1:07:20.792
Claire, wake... Claire, wake up!

1:07:21.626 --> 1:07:23.661
Jesus, Claire, you were
having a nightmare.

1:07:24.862 --> 1:07:26.564
What was that about?

1:07:27.899 --> 1:07:28.933
Honey?

1:07:29.734 --> 1:07:31.603
Oh, geez!

1:07:31.636 --> 1:07:33.738
You scared me half to death.

1:07:37.742 --> 1:07:40.678
Okay, I'll make you
a nice cup of tea.

1:07:40.712 --> 1:07:42.312
It's gonna help you sleep, okay?

1:07:43.581 --> 1:07:44.849
Okay, just calm down.

1:08:30.762 --> 1:08:31.796
Fuck you.

1:08:36.968 --> 1:08:38.970
You can feel it, can't you?

1:08:43.373 --> 1:08:45.308
I don't feel anything.

1:08:45.342 --> 1:08:46.410
Nagging.

1:08:47.210 --> 1:08:48.512
Clawing at you.

1:08:49.781 --> 1:08:50.991
And the more you
try to fight it,

1:08:51.015 --> 1:08:52.750
the stronger it gets.

1:08:53.818 --> 1:08:55.820
Like that pang in your stomach.

1:08:57.121 --> 1:08:58.221
Or the smell.

1:09:01.125 --> 1:09:02.325
None of this is real.

1:09:03.493 --> 1:09:05.596
What you feel in your gut
is hunger.

1:09:06.229 --> 1:09:08.099
Hunger is real.

1:09:10.168 --> 1:09:11.936
What you smell...

1:09:13.738 --> 1:09:15.205
Where's your mother, Claire?

1:09:15.338 --> 1:09:16.874
Where's Helen?

1:09:18.710 --> 1:09:21.713
I'm here. I've always been here.

1:09:22.080 --> 1:09:24.481
You're just not
paying attention.

1:09:24.514 --> 1:09:28.086
Something sure stinks,
smells like a real mess.

1:09:28.886 --> 1:09:31.122
- Like the mess in the bucket?
- No.

1:09:32.056 --> 1:09:34.224
It's a different kind of mess,

1:09:34.257 --> 1:09:35.927
like something is rotting.

1:09:36.226 --> 1:09:38.328
Like maybe something like this?

1:09:38.361 --> 1:09:41.065
Where on earth did you
find that old carrot?

1:09:41.099 --> 1:09:42.800
It was under the bed.

1:09:42.834 --> 1:09:45.402
It looks like it's been
there for days and days.

1:09:45.435 --> 1:09:47.872
Is that what's making
the bad smell?

1:09:47.905 --> 1:09:50.808
Well, it's rotting,
but not that bad.

1:09:50.842 --> 1:09:52.777
Is there anything else
under the bed?

1:09:53.745 --> 1:09:54.779
Um...

1:09:55.947 --> 1:09:58.182
A piece of a broken plate.

1:09:58.216 --> 1:09:59.917
A broken plate, huh?

1:09:59.951 --> 1:10:02.285
Yep, I wonder how that happened.

1:10:02.787 --> 1:10:05.089
I don't know,
but I certainly hope

1:10:05.123 --> 1:10:07.725
no one got hurt
when that plate broke.

1:10:07.759 --> 1:10:09.560
Let me look and see.

1:10:10.393 --> 1:10:12.063
Well, what is it?

1:10:13.296 --> 1:10:17.034
I think somebody did get
hurt when that plate broke,

1:10:17.068 --> 1:10:19.670
and I think it's where
the bad smell is coming from.

1:10:20.270 --> 1:10:22.840
Is there a mess under there,
young lady?

1:10:22.874 --> 1:10:25.308
Um... yes.

1:10:25.342 --> 1:10:27.544
I wonder who it is.

1:10:50.333 --> 1:10:51.368
Claire.

1:10:54.672 --> 1:10:55.873
Get off me!

1:11:06.150 --> 1:11:07.885
You shoulda let me help you.

1:11:39.851 --> 1:11:42.320
A mother's love never dies,

1:11:43.988 --> 1:11:45.022
but she can.

1:13:33.564 --> 1:13:34.999
I wonder who it is.

1:13:41.172 --> 1:13:42.440
Shit.

1:13:56.787 --> 1:13:57.822
Shit.

1:14:07.832 --> 1:14:08.866
No, no, no.

1:14:10.701 --> 1:14:12.370
You haven't eaten in days.

1:14:15.306 --> 1:14:16.506
Bet that oatmeal and tuna

1:14:16.539 --> 1:14:18.059
look pretty good right now,
don't they?

1:14:18.642 --> 1:14:19.744
No, no, no.

1:14:20.678 --> 1:14:22.380
Nothing since that day.

1:14:22.680 --> 1:14:23.714
The fight.

1:14:26.884 --> 1:14:28.419
No, none...
None of this is truth.

1:14:28.452 --> 1:14:29.587
This isn't real.

1:14:29.620 --> 1:14:31.589
Look at the condition
of that food.

1:14:31.622 --> 1:14:33.290
How hungry are you right now?

1:14:33.324 --> 1:14:34.492
How thirsty?

1:14:35.626 --> 1:14:36.626
How dirty?

1:14:38.329 --> 1:14:40.164
When you woke up
from being drugged,

1:14:40.965 --> 1:14:43.167
you closed your door to
that part of the world,

1:14:43.200 --> 1:14:45.870
just like you shut out
all those other parts.

1:14:47.171 --> 1:14:49.440
But that just made you
more accessible to us.

1:14:52.676 --> 1:14:53.677
Us?

1:14:54.678 --> 1:14:56.714
Now, that we're
opening doors, Claire,

1:14:57.547 --> 1:14:58.849
let's open all of them.

1:15:03.721 --> 1:15:05.656
Oh, your car broke down?

1:15:05.689 --> 1:15:08.025
Well, come on in, use my phone.

1:15:19.670 --> 1:15:20.704
Mommy!

1:15:23.374 --> 1:15:24.408
My ball!

1:15:44.929 --> 1:15:46.864
Oh, my god!

1:15:46.897 --> 1:15:48.132
What did you do?

1:15:49.533 --> 1:15:51.068
I think he's dead.

1:15:55.106 --> 1:15:56.140
Michael!

1:16:36.981 --> 1:16:38.249
No, no, no, no.

1:17:00.804 --> 1:17:02.607
Mom, please,
please, please help me,

1:17:02.641 --> 1:17:03.974
please help me, please help.

1:17:04.008 --> 1:17:06.277
I don't know what to do,
I don't know what to do.

1:17:06.310 --> 1:17:09.413
Help me, help, help, help me.

1:17:36.840 --> 1:17:37.975
I can't do this.

1:17:38.008 --> 1:17:39.944
God, what did you do?

1:17:41.345 --> 1:17:44.181
Bad girls do bad things,
bad girls do bad things.

1:17:44.215 --> 1:17:46.350
What did you do?

1:17:48.152 --> 1:17:49.887
Bad girls go to jail,
bad girls go to jail,

1:17:49.920 --> 1:17:52.189
bad girls go to jail,
bad girls go to jail.

1:17:57.428 --> 1:17:59.063
No, honey.

1:17:59.096 --> 1:18:01.700
This is going to be
much worse than jail.

1:18:01.732 --> 1:18:03.702
Bad girls do bad things,
bad girls do bad things,

1:18:03.734 --> 1:18:06.070
bad girls do bad things,
bad girls do bad things.

1:18:06.103 --> 1:18:07.771
And that's not happening.

1:18:16.013 --> 1:18:17.616
Are we going home?

1:18:19.684 --> 1:18:23.220
No, we're not gonna go home,
we can't.

1:18:23.254 --> 1:18:25.789
Not 'til I can clean this up
and figure out what to do.

1:18:29.860 --> 1:18:31.495
They're gonna come and get me.

1:18:32.529 --> 1:18:34.265
No, no, they're not.

1:18:35.799 --> 1:18:37.736
We're gonna hide.

1:18:37.768 --> 1:18:40.371
We're gonna stay here and hide,
and like...

1:18:40.404 --> 1:18:43.073
It's gonna be like
playing a game, right?

1:18:50.447 --> 1:18:52.149
Mommy, I'm scared.

1:18:54.451 --> 1:18:56.820
You don't have to be scared,
mommy's here now.

1:18:58.155 --> 1:18:59.256
Mommy's here.

1:19:00.891 --> 1:19:02.826
Mommy's gonna take care of you.

1:19:03.294 --> 1:19:04.629
Mommy loves you.

1:19:05.929 --> 1:19:07.965
Mommy loves you so much.

1:20:52.269 --> 1:20:53.904
No.

1:20:53.937 --> 1:20:55.139
I don't do things like that.

1:20:55.172 --> 1:20:56.216
You've been doing things
like that

1:20:56.240 --> 1:20:57.809
your whole life, Claire.

1:20:57.842 --> 1:20:59.878
You killed a kitten
when you were five.

1:21:01.278 --> 1:21:02.680
Karma's a bitch, isn't it?

1:21:02.714 --> 1:21:04.481
What do you mean?

1:21:04.515 --> 1:21:07.518
I mean, starvation is
a slow death, Claire,

1:21:07.551 --> 1:21:09.353
and if anyone deserves it,
you do.

1:21:09.386 --> 1:21:11.021
No, I'm not... I'm not going.

1:21:11.054 --> 1:21:13.924
You killed your mother, Claire.

1:21:13.957 --> 1:21:16.293
The only person
who ever loved you.

1:21:17.227 --> 1:21:18.797
How are you gonna
get out of here now?

1:21:19.564 --> 1:21:22.600
You also killed the only person
who knows that you're here.

1:21:23.902 --> 1:21:25.135
Looks like you're stuck.

1:21:31.542 --> 1:21:33.010
It's not there.

1:21:33.043 --> 1:21:34.879
What?

1:21:34.913 --> 1:21:36.447
The key to your ankle bracelet.

1:21:36.480 --> 1:21:37.520
- No.
- You already looked.

1:21:37.548 --> 1:21:38.917
Don't you remember?

1:21:38.949 --> 1:21:42.453
No, it has to be in here.
It has to be in here.

1:22:27.364 --> 1:22:28.499
Sorry, Helen.

1:22:31.836 --> 1:22:32.871
Didn't mean to.

1:22:34.672 --> 1:22:37.341
You made a real
mess of it this time, dear.

1:22:38.676 --> 1:22:39.711
I know.

1:22:42.780 --> 1:22:44.248
And I am sorry.

1:22:47.484 --> 1:22:49.086
I know.

1:23:53.051 --> 1:23:54.484
I remember that day now.

1:23:59.122 --> 1:24:00.324
I was so sad.

1:24:04.294 --> 1:24:06.898
I saw you first,

1:24:06.931 --> 1:24:08.465
coming out of the store.

1:24:09.433 --> 1:24:10.467
Both of you.

1:24:12.971 --> 1:24:16.608
I remembered you from the day
that we signed the papers.

1:24:18.643 --> 1:24:21.478
When they forced me to put
my baby up for adoption.

1:24:24.916 --> 1:24:26.316
And then you came out.

1:24:29.219 --> 1:24:31.589
My god, you were so big,
I couldn't believe it.

1:24:33.156 --> 1:24:35.059
You were showing them
the gumball

1:24:35.093 --> 1:24:37.461
that you had just gotten
from the machine.

1:24:40.130 --> 1:24:42.332
And you were so excited
because it was red,

1:24:44.102 --> 1:24:45.369
your favorite flavor.

1:24:50.474 --> 1:24:52.910
You looked so happy, I could...

1:24:52.944 --> 1:24:55.445
I could almost hear
the excitement in your voice.

1:25:01.019 --> 1:25:03.453
I wanted so badly
to tell you that...

1:25:03.487 --> 1:25:05.556
That cherry was my favorite too.

1:25:07.324 --> 1:25:09.727
I still couldn't believe
how much you had grown.

1:25:12.030 --> 1:25:14.164
How much time had passed.

1:25:28.780 --> 1:25:30.514
And then I realized...

1:25:34.952 --> 1:25:38.422
That if I had just seen you
without them,

1:25:38.455 --> 1:25:41.759
I... I never would've
recognized you.

1:25:47.865 --> 1:25:51.268
And I realized how much
of your life I had missed.

1:25:59.877 --> 1:26:02.046
I realized how much
I really loved you.

1:26:05.717 --> 1:26:07.885
Because a mother's love
never dies.

1:26:09.754 --> 1:26:11.354
You shoulda let me help you.

1:26:17.427 --> 1:26:19.764
I never meant to hurt anybody.

1:26:24.267 --> 1:26:25.703
I just wanted you back.

1:26:30.842 --> 1:26:33.010
Please, can you let me go now?

1:26:33.044 --> 1:26:36.413
I promise
that I'll be a good girl.

1:26:36.446 --> 1:26:37.949
I can't do anything now.

1:26:52.764 --> 1:26:55.066
I'm gonna die here alone.

1:26:59.036 --> 1:27:01.773
I'm... I'm gonna die here alone.

1:27:04.742 --> 1:27:05.810
You...

1:27:07.845 --> 1:27:09.479
Will never be alone again.
