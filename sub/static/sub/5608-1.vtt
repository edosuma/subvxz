00:26.644 --> 00:28.277
I thought I heard something.

00:28.279 --> 00:30.613
Suicide bombing in Tel Aviv.

00:30.615 --> 00:32.615
56 dead.

00:32.616 --> 00:34.417
Terrorists?

00:34.419 --> 00:37.853
No one's taken
responsibility yet.

00:39.126 --> 00:40.959
There is credible evidence

00:40.961 --> 00:43.427
of coordinated attacks
around the world.

00:45.966 --> 00:48.867
Including New York.

00:55.876 --> 00:58.777
This is the day I dread
every day I'm on the job.

01:00.446 --> 01:03.414
But it's something
you're prepared for.

01:03.416 --> 01:06.284
Question is,

01:06.286 --> 01:08.953
prepared for what?

01:10.924 --> 01:13.524
I'll put on some coffee.

01:38.451 --> 01:40.885
Lacey!

01:43.023 --> 01:45.123
Don't you think
you've had enough there, hon?

01:45.125 --> 01:47.591
Time for a private dance.

01:47.593 --> 01:49.327
Look, you know
your little singles

01:49.329 --> 01:50.428
aren't gonna get you that.

01:50.430 --> 01:52.663
No singles today.

01:56.169 --> 01:57.902
Look at you.

01:57.904 --> 01:59.737
This'll be the last time
you'll ever see me.

01:59.739 --> 02:02.307
Did you find somebody
you like better?

02:03.643 --> 02:05.476
Soon, I will wear a king's crown

02:05.478 --> 02:07.745
and wed 72 virgins in heaven.

02:08.848 --> 02:10.715
Everyone will know my name.

02:12.118 --> 02:14.018
Inshallah.

02:14.020 --> 02:16.821
It is God's will.

02:16.823 --> 02:18.522
Cool.

02:18.524 --> 02:21.792
Let me just...
get rid of my tray.

02:34.707 --> 02:36.741
Uh, yeah, I don't know
if it's an emergency,

02:36.743 --> 02:39.210
but I just heard this guy saying
some crazy, 9/11-type stuff.

02:39.212 --> 02:40.678
I definitely think
you should check him out.

02:55.061 --> 02:56.727
Lacey Chambers?

02:56.729 --> 02:59.830
Yeah, hi. I called.

02:59.832 --> 03:01.565
I'm Officer Reagan,
this is Officer Janko.

03:01.567 --> 03:02.901
Can you tell us what happened?

03:02.903 --> 03:06.337
So, uh, this customer...

03:06.339 --> 03:09.207
he's a regular...
all of a sudden,

03:09.209 --> 03:11.475
starts talking
about 72 virgins in the sky

03:11.477 --> 03:13.311
and everybody knowing his name?

03:14.814 --> 03:15.980
What is his name?

03:15.982 --> 03:17.648
Uh, Stas.

03:17.650 --> 03:20.385
I don't know if
that's short for something.

03:20.387 --> 03:22.653
He usually comes in,
nurses a couple beers,

03:22.655 --> 03:25.189
and has, like,
a few dollars for tips.

03:25.191 --> 03:26.757
Do you know his full name?

03:26.759 --> 03:28.126
No.

03:28.128 --> 03:29.727
Just "Stas."

03:29.729 --> 03:31.930
Has he ever paid
with a credit card?

03:31.932 --> 03:32.897
Only cash.

03:32.899 --> 03:34.732
Like most of the guys here.

03:34.734 --> 03:36.301
Description?

03:36.303 --> 03:37.302
Middle Eastern?

03:37.304 --> 03:38.436
Nope.

03:38.438 --> 03:39.870
He's, uh, tall.

03:39.872 --> 03:44.075
Sort of attractive in, like,
a Viking-dude way.

03:44.077 --> 03:45.410
Okay, so, what... you work here,

03:45.412 --> 03:47.245
what, take a little toke,

03:47.247 --> 03:49.047
have a couple shots?

03:49.049 --> 03:50.415
What do you mean?

03:50.417 --> 03:52.150
Listen, I would need
a little buzz to work here, too,

03:52.152 --> 03:54.485
but I just need to know
how reliable a narrator you are.

03:54.487 --> 03:57.021
Well...

03:57.023 --> 03:58.756
I called you guys.

03:58.758 --> 03:59.924
Did he ever give you

03:59.926 --> 04:01.225
a phone number,
any way to reach him?

04:01.227 --> 04:03.261
- No.
- Maybe his prints are on a glass

04:03.263 --> 04:04.528
or a bill that he handled?

04:04.530 --> 04:07.098
I didn't think of that.

04:07.100 --> 04:09.233
Are there security cameras here?

04:10.636 --> 04:13.771
Let me call my manager.

04:15.635 --> 04:17.708
Seriously, when was the last
time the Mets and the Yanks

04:17.709 --> 04:19.610
were this hot,
this deep in the season?

04:19.612 --> 04:21.911
2000, subway Series.

04:21.914 --> 04:23.081
- That was good times.
- Yeah.

04:23.083 --> 04:24.248
Yeah, you remember

04:24.250 --> 04:26.550
when Clemens chucked
that broken bat at Piazza?

04:26.552 --> 04:27.986
That was some 'roid rage.

04:27.988 --> 04:30.054
They should've known
about Roger right there.

04:30.056 --> 04:32.123
- Boom! Boom, boom!
- Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey!

04:32.125 --> 04:33.724
- Calm down, calm down.
- Speaking of 'roid rage...

04:33.726 --> 04:34.692
Come on.

04:37.030 --> 04:38.696
Watch out.

04:40.300 --> 04:41.232
Hey!

04:41.234 --> 04:42.666
- Boom, boom! Boom!
- Hey.

04:42.668 --> 04:44.068
- Allah...
- Come here, come here.

04:44.070 --> 04:46.670
- Allah...
- Get over here, get over here.

04:46.672 --> 04:49.173
Slow down, slow down.

04:49.175 --> 04:50.741
Say it in English.

04:50.743 --> 04:51.809
All right.

04:51.811 --> 04:52.910
Shut up, shut up.

04:52.912 --> 04:53.878
Give me some I.D.

04:53.880 --> 04:55.446
- You got I.D. on you?
- I.D, I.D.

04:55.448 --> 04:57.948
- You got I.D.?
- I.D., I.D., I.D.

04:57.950 --> 04:59.583
- I.D.
- Stay there.

04:59.585 --> 05:01.785
It's from INS.

05:01.787 --> 05:03.454
His immigration status.

05:03.456 --> 05:05.723
I heard you the first time,
all right?

05:05.725 --> 05:08.826
Hey! Can you help us
with a translation here?

05:08.828 --> 05:10.761
Come here. What's this guy
talking about?

05:10.763 --> 05:12.830
Talk to him...
tell him what you're saying.

05:15.468 --> 05:18.702
Tell him the part
about boom and bomb.

05:18.704 --> 05:20.971
Nah, nah, nah, man, sorry...
I never heard that language before.

05:20.973 --> 05:22.106
Hey, Dad!

05:22.108 --> 05:23.541
Hey, Dad, come over here.

05:23.543 --> 05:25.143
Can you understand
what this guy's saying?

05:29.215 --> 05:30.548
Tell him the part
about the bomb.

05:30.550 --> 05:31.949
What about that? Say it again.

05:33.520 --> 05:36.987
He's from Afghanistan,
but it's a very obscure dialect.

05:36.989 --> 05:38.589
I think he's Hazaragi.

05:39.559 --> 05:40.925
- Hazaragi?
- From the mountains.

05:40.927 --> 05:44.028
...boom-de-doom! Boom! Boom!

05:44.030 --> 05:46.531
I think everyone knows
what that means.

05:46.533 --> 05:48.632
Call the Wheel.

05:48.634 --> 05:50.634
See if anybody speaks...
what is it?

05:50.636 --> 05:51.702
Hazaragi.

05:51.704 --> 05:52.937
That. Hazzy-raggy.

05:52.939 --> 05:55.440
Yeah. Shut up.

05:55.442 --> 05:58.008
We got to find out what the hell
he's talking about.

-DIFUNDE LA CULTURA-

06:28.955 --> 06:31.356
The Justice Department
called me in twice last week.

06:31.358 --> 06:33.458
I spent hours
transcribing wiretaps,

06:33.460 --> 06:35.427
and it turned out
to be nonsense.

06:35.429 --> 06:37.396
Today I have senior colloquium...
350 students...

06:37.398 --> 06:39.398
and I was promised
I wouldn't be disturbed.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.132
This is an emergency.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.168
Yeah, that's what
they always say.

06:43.170 --> 06:45.136
This is Barry Hamidi,
a linguistics professor

06:45.138 --> 06:46.271
at Baruch College.

06:46.273 --> 06:48.340
Justice uses him all the time.

06:48.342 --> 06:50.842
- Nice to meet you, Detective.
- Glad you're here, Barry.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.277
Hey, sit down.

06:52.279 --> 06:54.646
Sit down!

06:54.648 --> 06:55.781
Guy's been jumping
out of his skin.

06:55.783 --> 06:57.015
Don't know what the hell

06:57.017 --> 06:59.250
he's talking about...
can you help us out here?

07:08.862 --> 07:11.129
...bomb-de-doom.

07:19.072 --> 07:21.239
Okay.

07:21.241 --> 07:22.708
He doesn't want
to get into trouble,

07:22.710 --> 07:26.211
but he says he knows of a plot
to detonate bombs in this city.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.280
When?

07:33.086 --> 07:35.186
Today.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.525
Why don't you take a seat.

07:40.527 --> 07:43.729
We wipe the footage
every 24 hours,

07:43.731 --> 07:47.499
so if he was in here last night,
it should've grabbed him.

07:47.501 --> 07:50.702
Okay, you're gonna have
to look real close, Lacey.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.270
That's him. That's Stas.

07:52.272 --> 07:54.072
Rewind it.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.575
Can you, uh, punch in?

08:00.080 --> 08:02.947
How about him coming out
of the club?

08:02.949 --> 08:04.549
All right.

08:08.522 --> 08:09.988
Damn. Uh,

08:09.990 --> 08:12.591
do you have any cameras
inside of the club?

08:12.593 --> 08:14.959
No. We don't want to be filmed.

08:14.961 --> 08:17.596
No cameras allowed.

08:19.966 --> 08:22.901
Okay, thank you very much.

08:34.448 --> 08:36.948
You run a business like this,
you really want to lie to a cop?

08:36.950 --> 08:39.451
Who said I was lying
about anything?

08:39.453 --> 08:41.152
Where's the other camera?

08:41.154 --> 08:43.388
What other camera
are you talking about?

08:43.390 --> 08:45.223
Want to waste my time?

08:49.262 --> 08:51.797
All right, look, these girls
have been ripping me off

08:51.799 --> 08:54.232
at the registers,
so I put a hidden camera

08:54.234 --> 08:56.735
- over the bar.
- View of the customers, too?

08:57.471 --> 08:59.103
Yes.

08:59.105 --> 09:02.507
And we put extra security in
place in appropriate embassies,

09:02.509 --> 09:04.309
landmarks and synagogues,
but it's been quiet.

09:04.311 --> 09:06.244
Anything on
the Terror Tip hotline?

09:06.246 --> 09:07.779
We've been chasing down
every call,

09:07.781 --> 09:09.781
but it's the usual
cranks and pranks.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.215
This is from Homeland Security.

09:11.217 --> 09:13.184
There have been some
legitimate red flags, though...

09:13.186 --> 09:15.153
one which was caught
by Detective Reagan,

09:15.155 --> 09:17.589
the other Officer Reagan.

09:20.461 --> 09:22.327
How do you know?

09:29.803 --> 09:31.803
I consider it part
of my job to know.

09:31.805 --> 09:33.672
- Because?
- Because even though you think

09:33.674 --> 09:35.607
there's no connection
between this office

09:35.609 --> 09:37.642
and the line-of-duty activities
of your offspring,

09:37.644 --> 09:40.044
the press and some of the public
think otherwise.

09:40.046 --> 09:41.880
Always have, always will.

09:41.882 --> 09:43.281
So you aid and abet.

09:43.283 --> 09:45.717
I stay ahead of it
as much as I can.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.452
There's a difference.

09:48.922 --> 09:52.791
Two seemingly isolated incidents
that could be connected.

09:52.793 --> 09:55.727
That's good police work.

10:03.637 --> 10:06.304
Okay.

10:06.306 --> 10:09.007
Tell us what you know
about this plot.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.981
Two weeks ago,
he rented to three men.

10:20.921 --> 10:22.954
He heard enough
on his rounds to believe

10:22.956 --> 10:24.523
they were very angry
with their situation in America.

10:24.525 --> 10:25.924
Angry how?

10:25.926 --> 10:26.925
In what way?

10:32.566 --> 10:35.266
They couldn't get jobs
or dates with American girls.

10:37.638 --> 10:39.838
The usual stupid stuff
young men talk about.

10:39.840 --> 10:40.839
Okay.

10:44.645 --> 10:48.013
But in the past week, he noticed
they were bringing in materials,

10:48.015 --> 10:49.814
like construction nails,
copper wire...

10:56.823 --> 10:58.289
...bomb-de-doom.

11:02.663 --> 11:04.696
He noticed the boxes
put out with the trash.

11:04.698 --> 11:07.032
And when he went in
to fix the leak...

11:08.368 --> 11:10.669
...that's where he saw
three bombs.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.138
Three bombs.

11:14.140 --> 11:17.108
Okay, well, you know
anything about the bombers...

11:17.110 --> 11:19.410
they affiliated
with the Tel Aviv bombers?

11:23.984 --> 11:25.984
He doesn't know.

11:25.986 --> 11:27.986
Well, tell me about the bombs.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.520
What do they look like?

11:36.063 --> 11:39.530
One is on a timer, the other two
work with, uh, toggle switches.

11:39.532 --> 11:40.865
Toggle switch...

11:40.867 --> 11:43.301
press the button... and boom?

11:43.303 --> 11:45.670
Suicide bombs?

11:51.011 --> 11:52.978
Yeah.

11:52.980 --> 11:55.279
You know a lot
about bombs, Naseem.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.924
There was a bomb maker
in his village

12:05.926 --> 12:08.126
in Afghanistan
who blew himself up.

12:09.896 --> 12:12.063
Scared him very badly
as a child.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.165
I bet. You know,
you play with bombs,

12:14.167 --> 12:15.900
you get blown up. Is that why

12:15.902 --> 12:18.036
- you're scared... you playing with
bombs, Naseem? - Come on.

12:18.038 --> 12:19.370
He's answering the questions.

12:19.372 --> 12:21.973
You want me to believe him?

12:21.975 --> 12:23.942
He's telling me
a bunch of craziness.

12:23.944 --> 12:27.612
How do I know
he's not making the bombs?

12:27.614 --> 12:29.247
Naseem.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.816
If you're not
telling us the truth,

12:31.818 --> 12:33.985
now's a good time to do it.

12:33.987 --> 12:35.720
While we can help you.

12:47.567 --> 12:49.500
He only swears to God.
He swears to God.

12:49.502 --> 12:51.102
He swears on his family, okay?

12:51.104 --> 12:53.504
- You want me to believe that this schmo
happened upon - He wouldn't lie.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.540
some bomb plot to blow up
New York City?

12:55.542 --> 12:58.342
- Hey, sit down!
- He loves America.

12:58.344 --> 13:01.780
- How the hell do we know
he wouldn't lie? - He loves America.

13:01.782 --> 13:03.447
Shut up and sit down!

13:06.519 --> 13:08.687
He swears he's only
trying to help us to stop

13:08.689 --> 13:10.188
this terrible situation
from happening.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.023
For all I know he
could be setting us up,

13:12.025 --> 13:13.524
pointing us in one direction
when the bomb's

13:13.526 --> 13:15.927
- in another direction, okay?
- Calm down.

13:18.364 --> 13:20.065
I think you're jumping
to a lot of conclusions.

13:20.067 --> 13:23.101
It's my job to jump
to a lot of conclusions.

13:32.179 --> 13:35.113
This just came in. Homeland
Security ran all the names

13:35.115 --> 13:37.281
and got confirmation
on Naseem Akhtar's status.

13:37.283 --> 13:38.482
Thank you.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.118
Is he really here
on a Work visa?

13:40.120 --> 13:42.153
He's in this country
100% legally.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.421
Not on any watch lists.

13:43.423 --> 13:44.723
All right, well,
that checks out.

13:44.725 --> 13:46.057
What about the, uh, tenants?

13:46.059 --> 13:48.292
Nothing. This came in

13:48.294 --> 13:50.161
from One PP. It's a screen grab

13:50.163 --> 13:53.531
from a strip club security
camera on 53rd and 12th.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.100
This guy was apparently

13:55.102 --> 13:57.501
talking about
meeting the 72 virgins

13:57.503 --> 14:01.239
- last night. - 53rd and 12th.
That's close to where Naseem lives.

14:01.241 --> 14:02.941
What, you think

14:02.943 --> 14:05.043
that guy's one of his tenants?

14:05.045 --> 14:06.444
I don't know.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.747
Show him,
see if it rings a bell.

14:13.653 --> 14:16.487
All right, Naseem,
here's your chance.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.156
This one of your bombers?

14:22.129 --> 14:24.395
That's one of the renters.

14:24.397 --> 14:25.596
...Stasa.

14:25.598 --> 14:26.965
They call him Stas.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.867
Yes. Yes!

14:28.869 --> 14:31.269
That's him.

14:42.048 --> 14:44.315
JTTF drew a blank on Stas
and the other tenants.

14:44.317 --> 14:45.683
They're not known
to the department,

14:45.685 --> 14:46.885
at least under those identities.

14:46.887 --> 14:49.888
Run their names through
Canadian Incident Database.

14:49.890 --> 14:52.290
- Canada? - A lot of jihadis
slip in through Canada.

14:52.292 --> 14:55.493
And run Naseem Akhtar, too.
See what we get.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.295
CO of the bomb squad
is en route.

14:57.297 --> 14:59.430
Chief Rucker from FDNY

14:59.432 --> 15:01.365
and MTA Director
of Safety and Security

15:01.367 --> 15:02.834
- will be here shortly.
- ESU?

15:02.836 --> 15:04.068
John Knight is out at Montauk

15:04.070 --> 15:06.237
with his family,
but he's gonna head back.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.039
Send the chopper.
Worse case scenario,

15:08.041 --> 15:10.408
we're gonna need
all our resources ready to go.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.476
- Already did. - Should we
make some kind of statement?

15:12.478 --> 15:14.012
No.

15:14.014 --> 15:16.614
It's the question on everyone's
mind... is New York next?

15:16.616 --> 15:19.483
We don't have the answer to it,
so no. What is it, Baker?

15:19.485 --> 15:21.419
There's been two more bombings.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.955
London and Bangladesh,
subway and market.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.564
It's happening.

15:33.566 --> 15:36.701
Not here, it isn't.

15:58.975 --> 16:00.374
Why don't you two
grab a couple chairs,

16:00.376 --> 16:01.675
have a seat out of the way.

16:01.677 --> 16:03.944
We're checking out your tenants.

16:03.946 --> 16:07.381
They choppered you in,
huh, John?

16:07.383 --> 16:10.451
Third floor apartment, right
side, window fan is still on.

16:10.453 --> 16:13.120
Yeah? So what?

16:13.122 --> 16:15.255
Well, according to Naseem,
that means someone's home.

16:15.257 --> 16:17.324
They never leave the fan on
unless they're there.

16:17.326 --> 16:19.526
Do we know if there's
anyone else involved?

16:19.528 --> 16:21.595
Those guys outside
could be lookouts

16:21.597 --> 16:22.762
or accomplices.

16:22.764 --> 16:24.465
Only what he said:
three bombs...

16:24.467 --> 16:26.733
Three bombers. Got it.

16:27.936 --> 16:30.537
Muslims pray
five times a day, right?

16:30.539 --> 16:32.572
The third one,
the dhuhr, starts soon.

16:32.574 --> 16:35.409
All we gotta do is just watch,

16:35.411 --> 16:37.878
see which one of these guys
pulls out a rug and gets down

16:37.880 --> 16:41.482
- on their knees.
- What does that matter, Danny?

16:41.484 --> 16:43.850
Just because they're Muslims
doesn't mean they're terrorists.

16:43.852 --> 16:45.419
I didn't say
just 'cause they're Muslims

16:45.421 --> 16:46.586
they're terrorists,
but I'm saying

16:46.588 --> 16:48.389
there's a certain profile
they fit.

16:48.391 --> 16:51.158
Really? Stas looked like
a frat boy in that photo.

16:51.160 --> 16:54.094
Those two brothers from
Boston did, too. It could be

16:54.096 --> 16:55.595
anyone now.
That's what's so scary.

16:55.597 --> 16:59.633
Right. And our job is to take
all of 'em off the street.

17:12.881 --> 17:14.381
So the informant
gave you permission

17:14.383 --> 17:15.682
to search the apartment?

17:15.684 --> 17:16.750
Yes.

17:16.752 --> 17:19.185
And obviously the
renters have not.

17:19.188 --> 17:20.521
What's your point?

17:20.522 --> 17:22.321
You could make a case
to get access

17:22.324 --> 17:23.424
to the heating and plumbing.

17:23.425 --> 17:25.659
- But?
- But...

17:25.661 --> 17:28.595
the law comes down to the guy
or guys who pay the rent

17:28.597 --> 17:30.597
have a right to a locked door.

17:30.599 --> 17:32.999
- That's not the answer I need.
- You wanted to know what I

17:33.001 --> 17:35.235
could sell to my boss
and that's what I'm telling you.

17:35.237 --> 17:36.937
I assumed we'd
be on the same side.

17:36.939 --> 17:38.939
And we are.

17:38.941 --> 17:41.141
I think there's one loophole
that we could fit through.

17:41.143 --> 17:44.545
An emergency exception that
could apply if you sign off.

17:44.547 --> 17:47.347
What would I be signing?

17:47.349 --> 17:50.584
The police can pursue any leads,
by any means necessary,

17:50.586 --> 17:54.054
if they feel there's a real
threat to the public safety.

17:54.056 --> 17:56.557
But I think the DA would
feel a lot more comfortable

17:56.559 --> 17:58.625
if a judge signed off
on a high-risk warrant.

17:58.627 --> 18:00.627
And I have a few judges
that owe me favors...

18:00.629 --> 18:02.696
Yeah, this is moving too fast.

18:02.698 --> 18:04.698
I think it's better
to ask forgiveness

18:04.700 --> 18:06.567
than permission on this one.

18:06.569 --> 18:09.103
Dad, you are moving

18:09.105 --> 18:11.371
on one man's
uncorroborated story.

18:11.373 --> 18:14.141
What if you raid that apartment,
kill three Muslims

18:14.143 --> 18:16.776
and don't find
a single bomb on site?

18:18.247 --> 18:21.381
That's a lot of backfire that
you're standing in front of.

18:23.519 --> 18:26.052
When I consider the alternative?

18:26.054 --> 18:27.687
I'll take that risk.

18:30.859 --> 18:33.127
Thank you.

18:41.803 --> 18:43.237
Goes without saying...

18:43.239 --> 18:45.172
We never had this conversation.

18:59.054 --> 19:00.420
Look, guys,

19:00.422 --> 19:02.756
we have no idea
what's waiting for us in there.

19:02.758 --> 19:04.324
We don't even know the
size of these devices.

19:04.326 --> 19:06.092
Could take the whole
building out, or the block.

19:07.429 --> 19:08.895
Should we just wait for them
to come outside?

19:08.897 --> 19:10.130
Put some snipers on the roof?

19:10.132 --> 19:11.532
They could have
a dead switch on those bombs.

19:11.534 --> 19:13.267
Finger comes off the
detonator for any reason...

19:13.269 --> 19:15.035
including getting shot...

19:15.037 --> 19:16.670
and the device
automatically detonates.

19:16.672 --> 19:18.338
Well, hopefully,
we'll be inside and on 'em

19:18.340 --> 19:20.073
before they even
know what's happening.

19:20.075 --> 19:22.476
And what if one of them
makes a move?

19:22.478 --> 19:25.712
Use any force necessary. Got it?

19:27.183 --> 19:28.582
Guys, let's move out.

19:29.285 --> 19:30.284
Let's go.

19:30.286 --> 19:31.685
All right, move out.

19:31.687 --> 19:33.387
Hey.

19:35.123 --> 19:36.557
You got that, right?

19:36.559 --> 19:38.458
Something goes wrong,
you light 'em up.

19:38.460 --> 19:41.195
Got it.

20:00.066 --> 20:03.580
OPENING SOON
HELL'S KITCHEN CLYBE MOTORCYCLES

20:12.528 --> 20:14.994
Hey. Oh!

20:14.996 --> 20:16.196
All right, doll!

20:17.733 --> 20:20.066
Very nice!

20:20.068 --> 20:22.836
Ah, geez...

21:43.419 --> 21:44.584
Get out of the way!

21:44.586 --> 21:45.552
Get out of the way!

21:45.554 --> 21:46.820
Get out of the way!

22:07.543 --> 22:09.242
- Police!
- Police!

22:09.244 --> 22:10.410
Don't move!

22:10.412 --> 22:11.545
- Police!
- Police! Don't move!

22:11.547 --> 22:13.447
- Don't move! Don't move!
- Don't you move!

22:13.449 --> 22:14.848
I said, don't move! Police!

22:21.122 --> 22:22.622
Shut your mouth. Shut up!

22:22.624 --> 22:24.157
Get down!

22:28.564 --> 22:30.930
Everybody okay?

22:30.932 --> 22:32.232
Anybody hit?!

22:32.234 --> 22:33.166
We're good!

22:33.168 --> 22:34.601
Are there any bombs?

22:42.344 --> 22:43.477
You good?

22:43.479 --> 22:45.512
Oh, yeah. They're not.

22:49.852 --> 22:51.918
We got a problem.
I only count two bombs.

22:51.920 --> 22:53.086
Naseem said
there were three bombs.

22:53.088 --> 22:54.388
We only got two bombs here.

22:54.390 --> 22:55.789
We're missing a bomb.

22:55.791 --> 22:57.156
They must've deployed it.
It could be anywhere.

22:57.158 --> 22:58.324
Son of a bitch is the only one

22:58.326 --> 22:59.559
who knows where
the other bomb is. Get a bus!

22:59.561 --> 23:00.894
Hey, hey.

23:03.632 --> 23:05.899
You hear me? You're not dying
until you tell me

23:05.901 --> 23:07.534
where that bomb is,
you son of a bitch!

23:07.536 --> 23:09.870
Where is it?!

23:22.019 --> 23:23.719
- Clear the hall!
- Let's go.

23:23.721 --> 23:25.721
Prepare for a blood
transfusion... BP 60,

23:25.723 --> 23:27.422
- heart rate 120.
- That's our guy.

23:28.325 --> 23:29.792
- Hey!
- BP 60, heart rate 120...

23:29.794 --> 23:31.760
- I need to talk to him before
you operate. - Turn, turn.

23:31.762 --> 23:34.162
- I need to operate before you
talk to him. - Hey, wait a minute!

23:34.164 --> 23:36.164
- Stop!
- What the hell are you doing?!

23:36.166 --> 23:37.967
- I need to talk to this son of a bitch!
- Keep on moving.

23:37.969 --> 23:40.068
- Keep on moving! Keep on moving!
- Go! Go! Go!

23:40.070 --> 23:42.337
Doc, you don't understand.
I got to talk...

23:42.339 --> 23:43.806
Stop. You're gonna
kill him, okay?

23:43.808 --> 23:45.340
You're gonna be killing
innocent people

23:45.342 --> 23:47.442
if you don't let me talk to him!

23:47.444 --> 23:49.778
Come on, you seen
what's going on TV.

23:49.780 --> 23:52.815
People are being
blown away here, Doc.

23:52.817 --> 23:55.718
Look, I get it... it's your job
to save his life,

23:55.720 --> 23:57.386
but it's my job to save theirs.

23:57.388 --> 23:58.621
Now, can he talk?

23:58.623 --> 23:59.989
Yeah, he's lucid, but he needs

23:59.991 --> 24:02.024
to get on the machines
to help him breathe.

24:02.026 --> 24:03.291
He needs
immediate attention, okay?

24:03.293 --> 24:05.394
Yeah, then, put him on
whatever machines you want.

24:05.396 --> 24:07.195
Just give me a second with him.

24:17.341 --> 24:19.441
Hello, Samir.

24:19.443 --> 24:22.645
I want you to tell me where
Stanislav Tarasenko is

24:22.647 --> 24:23.879
and what his target is.

24:30.621 --> 24:33.422
I know you speak English,
so why don't you drop it?

24:33.424 --> 24:37.760
It's too late to stop it.

24:37.762 --> 24:40.362
Inshallah.

24:40.364 --> 24:42.330
It is God's will.

24:42.332 --> 24:44.433
It's God's will to kill
innocent people, huh?

24:44.435 --> 24:45.768
Is that what you're saying?

24:45.770 --> 24:49.805
You know nothing of our God,

24:49.807 --> 24:52.675
of our will.

24:52.677 --> 24:56.679
Your laws... mean nothing.

24:58.883 --> 25:00.482
I die...

25:00.484 --> 25:02.585
a hundred more take my place.

25:02.587 --> 25:05.821
Allah Akbar.

25:05.823 --> 25:09.324
Allah Akbar.

25:09.326 --> 25:14.029
God... is... great.

25:16.801 --> 25:19.768
You're sure you're ready
to die, Samir? Is that it?

25:19.770 --> 25:23.205
I know what's waiting for me.

25:23.207 --> 25:25.608
There's no virgins
waiting for you, my friend.

25:27.377 --> 25:29.344
Johannam.

25:29.346 --> 25:31.113
It's in your Quran.

25:31.115 --> 25:33.582
Those who fail Allah
face a dark storm.

25:35.620 --> 25:38.386
You're nearly dead,
your bomb's been diffused.

25:38.388 --> 25:41.023
I'd say you failed Allah
pretty damn good.

25:41.025 --> 25:44.660
Now, you're gonna tell me
what I want to know,

25:44.662 --> 25:46.829
and I'll let you live.

25:46.831 --> 25:48.797
If you don't,
I'm gonna pull the plug

25:48.799 --> 25:51.667
on that machine over there,
and you're gonna die right now.

25:52.569 --> 25:56.304
Johannam is only
for nonbelievers.

25:56.306 --> 25:58.007
Do as you wish.

25:58.009 --> 26:02.477
Allah knows what's in my heart.

26:02.479 --> 26:05.648
It's your God
you'll have to face.

26:05.650 --> 26:07.549
I'm ready to face mine.

26:07.551 --> 26:09.918
Hope you're ready to face yours.

26:14.825 --> 26:16.158
Detective, what are you doing?

26:16.160 --> 26:17.126
Shut up.

26:17.128 --> 26:19.128
- This is crazy!
- I said, shut up!

26:20.031 --> 26:23.098
You think I'm bluffing?

26:23.100 --> 26:25.134
You think I'm bluffing?
You're gonna tell me

26:25.136 --> 26:28.904
what I want to know right now,
or I'm pulling this plug.

26:31.042 --> 26:33.776
What's the target?

26:33.778 --> 26:35.310
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

26:35.312 --> 26:37.946
Hey, Doc!
Doctor, come here fast!

26:37.948 --> 26:40.448
- What's going on?
- Come here! He's gonna kill him.

26:59.603 --> 27:02.637
Officer Reagan, right this way.

27:10.047 --> 27:12.881
Know what this
is about, Detective?

27:12.883 --> 27:14.583
I'm sorry. I don't.

27:28.165 --> 27:29.631
Your hunch was right, boss.

27:29.633 --> 27:33.035
Stanislaw Tarasenko entered
the United States illegally

27:33.037 --> 27:34.737
through Canada,
from Afghanistan.

27:34.739 --> 27:35.971
He was on their watch list.

27:35.973 --> 27:37.706
What do we know about him?

27:37.708 --> 27:39.108
He was born
in the Caucus Mountains,

27:39.110 --> 27:40.642
but went to high school
in Maryland.

27:40.644 --> 27:41.844
Commissioner?

27:41.846 --> 27:44.865
Got radicalized through
a campus group in college,

27:44.866 --> 27:46.949
and did some training last year
in Mazir-i-Sharif.

27:46.951 --> 27:48.183
Affiliations?

27:48.185 --> 27:50.219
No one knows who they are.
Totally off the grid.

27:50.221 --> 27:51.920
That's how they're catching
everybody by surprise.

27:51.922 --> 27:53.155
I need a minute.

27:53.157 --> 27:55.423
Hey.

27:55.425 --> 27:58.093
Hey.

28:01.465 --> 28:05.700
I need Intel on Stas
that isn't in any file.

28:05.702 --> 28:07.202
And I'm the guy?

28:07.204 --> 28:09.337
You could be.

28:09.339 --> 28:12.741
That club... that's where
he went to relax.

28:12.743 --> 28:14.009
That's where he drank.

28:14.011 --> 28:15.778
That's when people
reveal themselves.

28:15.780 --> 28:17.880
Yeah, but I came up
with nothing on Stas.

28:17.882 --> 28:19.581
Well, what about the waitress?

28:19.583 --> 28:21.016
You talked to her.

28:21.018 --> 28:22.584
I think she drinks
there, too, Dad.

28:22.586 --> 28:25.154
I think she makes a habit
of taking the edge off.

28:25.156 --> 28:27.555
But she did call 911

28:27.557 --> 28:29.892
off a couple of phrases
a customer used.

28:29.894 --> 28:31.593
Yeah, good point.

28:33.697 --> 28:36.098
Could you take
another crack at her?

28:36.967 --> 28:39.601
I think she's had
some time to think.

28:41.538 --> 28:44.239
Thank you.

28:46.543 --> 28:49.111
Boss, I'm thinking we
should take another shot

28:49.113 --> 28:50.478
at Samir Fayed.

28:50.480 --> 28:52.614
I heard Danny went at him
pretty hard.

28:52.616 --> 28:54.449
He's not gonna break.

28:54.451 --> 28:56.151
Well, what do we do now?

28:56.153 --> 28:58.854
We wait.

28:58.856 --> 29:01.690
Wait for what?

29:03.527 --> 29:05.294
This is the hard part, Sid.

29:05.296 --> 29:08.163
Time between doing
everything we can think of

29:08.165 --> 29:12.367
and finding out if it worked.

29:17.708 --> 29:20.242
I can't just sit here!

29:21.846 --> 29:24.679
Welcome to our world.

29:31.965 --> 29:34.078
DUSTY PINK

29:34.725 --> 29:36.524
Guys. What do you need?

29:36.526 --> 29:38.560
You spent a lot time
of time with Stas.

29:38.562 --> 29:40.295
Is there anything else
that you can tell us?

29:40.297 --> 29:42.264
Any small bit of
detail that might help?

29:43.834 --> 29:45.234
I need you to put down your
one and focus, please.

29:45.236 --> 29:47.369
- Just need one second.
I just have to... - No.

29:47.371 --> 29:48.603
Put the phone down.

29:48.605 --> 29:49.872
Okay, look, I'm sorry. I...

29:49.874 --> 29:51.240
We didn't get deep.

29:51.242 --> 29:53.976
He was some creepy dude who
watched me dance in the dark.

29:53.978 --> 29:55.543
Keep thinking, Lacey.

29:55.545 --> 29:57.579
Is there anything else
that comes to mind?

29:59.350 --> 30:01.350
Well, look, we know what kind
of girl he liked, right?

30:01.352 --> 30:03.551
That's for sure. I mean,
he never left me alone.

30:03.552 --> 30:05.087
Well, did he ever ask you on a date?

30:05.089 --> 30:06.755
Every time I saw him.

30:06.757 --> 30:08.857
Good. Did he ever mention
where he'd want to take you?

30:08.859 --> 30:11.426
Actually, yeah.

30:11.428 --> 30:13.428
He mentioned one place
a couple of times.

30:13.430 --> 30:16.131
He said that it was
almost as beautiful as I was.

30:16.133 --> 30:18.666
It was... "Siprani"?

30:18.668 --> 30:20.202
- I think...
- Siprani? It's a restaurant?

30:20.204 --> 30:22.037
- I guess so. I...
- Anything else

30:22.039 --> 30:24.940
he mentioned about the place?

30:26.476 --> 30:28.777
Uh, yeah, he works there, too.

30:28.779 --> 30:30.379
Great. What was his job?

30:30.381 --> 30:31.380
I have no idea.

30:31.382 --> 30:32.714
I always thought that

30:32.716 --> 30:34.783
it was probably manual labor,
'cause his hands

30:34.785 --> 30:36.418
- are really rough.
- Okay, all right,

30:36.420 --> 30:37.519
let's take it back to the name.

30:37.521 --> 30:39.187
Say it just the way
Stas said it.

30:39.189 --> 30:40.222
Use his accent.

30:40.224 --> 30:42.157
"Soprani."

30:42.159 --> 30:43.358
S...

30:43.360 --> 30:45.894
Damn it. I can... I can almost

30:45.896 --> 30:47.996
picture it.

30:47.998 --> 30:49.464
What do you mean
you can picture it?

30:49.466 --> 30:51.366
He would come here
from-from work.

30:51.368 --> 30:54.669
- He had the logo stitched into
his shirt. - Did he wear that shirt

30:54.671 --> 30:57.105
the night that he made
the threat to you?

30:57.107 --> 30:58.773
I don't know. He usually

30:58.775 --> 30:59.975
was wearing it.

30:59.977 --> 31:01.143
- We got a screen cap...
- Let's see.

31:01.145 --> 31:03.011
- Here...
- There you go.

31:03.013 --> 31:04.413
Ci...

31:04.415 --> 31:05.814
- Cipriani?
- That's it! Yes!

31:05.816 --> 31:07.416
There's three of them.
One on Wall Street

31:07.418 --> 31:09.717
- makes a really good target.
- Yeah, and he works there...

31:09.719 --> 31:11.762
- he knows how to get in and out.
- Let's call Danny and

31:11.763 --> 31:13.057
put out an alert. Thank you.

31:13.257 --> 31:15.123
Thank you.

31:15.125 --> 31:17.759
Damn.

31:30.140 --> 31:32.140
Mr. Costa?

31:32.142 --> 31:34.142
Yes.

31:34.144 --> 31:36.111
Detectives Reagan and Baez.

31:36.113 --> 31:37.879
Is this the guy?

31:37.881 --> 31:40.849
That's Stas... but I
haven't seen him in weeks.

31:40.851 --> 31:42.550
I thought he worked here.

31:42.552 --> 31:44.886
I thought he did, too.
He was on a maintenance crew

31:44.888 --> 31:47.889
that did cleaning and repairs
throughout the building.

31:47.891 --> 31:50.225
You got any views to the street
in this place?

31:50.227 --> 31:51.759
Not from this main space, no.

31:51.761 --> 31:53.561
This is it... one huge room.

31:53.563 --> 31:55.063
How about anywhere else in the
building, maybe another floor?

31:55.065 --> 31:58.433
The second floor...
looks out over the whole square.

31:58.435 --> 31:59.901
Okay. Stas work there, too?

31:59.903 --> 32:01.303
- Yes.
- All right, let's see it.

32:01.305 --> 32:02.937
Come on! Move!

32:09.946 --> 32:12.247
Hold on, hold on. Get back.

32:14.985 --> 32:16.551
- What's in here?
- Just supplies.

32:16.553 --> 32:17.652
Extra tables.

32:17.654 --> 32:19.388
Ready?

32:20.391 --> 32:22.224
Oh, my God, it's my manager!

32:22.226 --> 32:23.458
Son of a bitch.

32:24.961 --> 32:26.661
Call a bus.

32:36.340 --> 32:37.872
Detective 466

32:37.874 --> 32:39.974
requesting ESU
and the bomb squad,

32:39.976 --> 32:43.278
re: possible bomb
at this location.

32:56.235 --> 32:58.368
Police.

35:19.378 --> 35:20.811
Nice.

35:20.813 --> 35:22.813
Well.

35:22.815 --> 35:24.214
Okay.

35:24.216 --> 35:25.749
- Thanks.
- Well written,

35:25.751 --> 35:27.016
accurate.

35:27.018 --> 35:29.953
Moving, even,
in the right hands.

35:29.955 --> 35:31.988
It is in the right hands.

35:31.990 --> 35:34.958
Maybe reads a little bit
like a victory lap.

35:34.960 --> 35:36.226
Well...

35:36.228 --> 35:38.261
I'd say you've earned it.

35:38.263 --> 35:39.896
If I did, we all did.

35:42.968 --> 35:45.935
What's insidious
about terrorism is...

35:45.937 --> 35:47.871
it can get inside our heads,

35:47.873 --> 35:51.408
make us change the way
we live our lives.

35:53.512 --> 35:56.012
Then you wake up thinking...

35:56.014 --> 35:58.314
is this the day?

36:05.023 --> 36:09.158
It took this city a long time
to get its swagger back.

36:11.597 --> 36:15.499
Wouldn't that be a victory here?

36:29.014 --> 36:30.547
Good evening.

36:30.549 --> 36:33.149
I know there's been
a lot of conjecture

36:33.151 --> 36:35.685
about a terrorist incident
in the city today...

36:35.687 --> 36:39.255
understandable, given what
has happened across the world

36:39.257 --> 36:42.592
in the last 24 hours...

36:42.594 --> 36:44.861
but conjecture...

36:44.863 --> 36:47.030
is all that it was.

36:47.032 --> 36:50.434
The fatal shooting downtown
this morning was

36:50.436 --> 36:52.302
an isolated incident,

36:52.304 --> 36:56.072
involving a victim with a long
history of emotional problems.

36:56.074 --> 36:57.808
What about the police raid
on the West Side?

36:57.810 --> 37:00.009
There were
fatalities there, too.

37:00.011 --> 37:01.445
Well, that was
a separate incident.

37:01.447 --> 37:03.046
It is an ongoing investigation,

37:03.048 --> 37:06.015
and I cannot comment on it
any further.

37:06.885 --> 37:10.186
There is something else
I'd like to say.

37:10.188 --> 37:11.922
As a New Yorker...

37:11.924 --> 37:15.659
and for all of us New Yorkers
who have been through

37:15.661 --> 37:19.095
and come back from
a terrorist attack,

37:19.097 --> 37:22.231
our thoughts and prayers go out
to the families

37:22.233 --> 37:25.435
who lost loved ones in Tel Aviv,

37:25.437 --> 37:29.639
London and Bangladesh
this past day.

37:29.641 --> 37:31.641
We are with you

37:31.643 --> 37:34.678
in any way that we can help.

37:37.215 --> 37:39.215
And we are sorry...

37:39.217 --> 37:41.518
for your sorrows.

37:41.520 --> 37:44.521
Bless us, Lord, for these, Thy gifts,

37:44.523 --> 37:47.524
which we are about to receive
from Thy bounty,

37:47.526 --> 37:50.259
through Christ our Lord. Amen.

37:51.597 --> 37:54.998
Pops, is there wheat flour
in these mashed potatoes?

37:55.000 --> 37:56.666
Why, they don't look right?

37:56.668 --> 37:58.869
No. I'm just trying
to go gluten-free.

37:58.871 --> 38:00.003
Why?

38:00.005 --> 38:02.071
Just am.

38:02.073 --> 38:04.508
You got a condition?
She got a condition, Erin?

38:04.510 --> 38:05.718
- Not that I've heard of.
- No, I don't have

38:05.719 --> 38:07.442
celiac disease or anything.

38:07.713 --> 38:09.980
I'm just... trying it.

38:09.982 --> 38:11.447
So, who's the guy?

38:12.818 --> 38:14.150
What makes you ask that?

38:14.152 --> 38:15.218
Wait for it...

38:15.220 --> 38:17.086
I have a friend

38:17.088 --> 38:19.355
with celiac, yes.

38:19.357 --> 38:21.224
Ah, there we go.

38:21.226 --> 38:22.592
Told ya.

38:22.594 --> 38:23.827
And what made you ask that?

38:23.829 --> 38:25.662
Buddy of mine gave up
beer at parties

38:25.664 --> 38:27.797
because the girl
he's going with doesn't drink.

38:27.799 --> 38:29.298
What?

38:30.502 --> 38:32.268
- Big mouth.
- What?

38:32.270 --> 38:34.070
Read the room, bro.

38:34.072 --> 38:35.972
Does this buddy of yours know

38:35.974 --> 38:38.141
that the legal drinking age
is 21?

38:38.143 --> 38:39.175
Yes, Dad.

38:39.177 --> 38:41.277
Uh, how much beer
and at what parties?

38:41.279 --> 38:43.013
Mom, please.

38:43.015 --> 38:45.481
As the wise man said, what you
don't know can't hurt you.

38:45.483 --> 38:48.284
- I think it's a little late for that.
- Yeah, well,

38:48.286 --> 38:49.819
there's no need to dig deeper,
not just now.

38:49.821 --> 38:51.588
You know,

38:51.590 --> 38:53.289
I never got that saying.
If you don't know that

38:53.291 --> 38:55.425
getting hit by a bus hurts,
then you can play in traffic

38:55.427 --> 38:56.760
without fear,
but it doesn't mean

38:56.762 --> 38:57.827
you're not gonna get slammed.

38:57.829 --> 38:59.462
That's a bit literal.

38:59.464 --> 39:00.897
You know what

39:00.899 --> 39:03.099
the original saying was:
"So long as I know it not,

39:03.101 --> 39:04.233
it hurteth me not."

39:04.235 --> 39:06.937
British writer,
George Pettie, 1500s.

39:06.939 --> 39:09.573
And you know this how?

39:09.575 --> 39:11.808
Well, I had an
idle moment, once,

39:11.810 --> 39:13.543
and I looked it up, and I agree.

39:13.545 --> 39:15.244
Really?

39:16.682 --> 39:18.281
Sure. Take this table.

39:18.283 --> 39:20.249
I'd call us a pretty open bunch,

39:20.251 --> 39:21.685
but you don't think
there's things

39:21.687 --> 39:24.054
we don't know about
each other we're better off

39:24.056 --> 39:25.521
not knowing?

39:25.523 --> 39:27.557
Sleep better at night
not knowing?

39:27.559 --> 39:30.126
Like how Mom and Dad were
better off before they knew

39:30.128 --> 39:33.029
- that big mouth here drank at parties.
- All right.

39:33.031 --> 39:36.099
You're on a slippery slope,
Sean, but if you take that idea

39:36.101 --> 39:38.835
and expand it out over, say,
the eight million people

39:38.837 --> 39:41.571
walking around this city,
not all of them

39:41.573 --> 39:42.973
looking to do good.

39:42.975 --> 39:44.674
There probably is
a lot of things

39:44.676 --> 39:46.009
that I'd rather not know about.

39:46.011 --> 39:48.177
You got that right.

39:48.914 --> 39:50.480
You mean what you guys know.

39:50.482 --> 39:52.215
The near misses and stuff.

39:54.185 --> 39:56.219
Not just us, but sure.

39:58.335 --> 39:59.623
I'm with Sean.

40:01.893 --> 40:04.293

40:04.295 --> 40:06.663
Cheers to that.

40:06.665 --> 40:07.497
Cheers.
