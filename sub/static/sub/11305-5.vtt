00:01.000 --> 00:02.833
<i>- Previously on Wynonna Earp...</i>
- Willa!

00:03.003 --> 00:05.040
Who have you hurt the most?

00:07.049 --> 00:09.712
- I forgive her!
- Just one crazy girl.

00:09.885 --> 00:12.252
You're saying Bobo's hiding revenants
in the trailer park?

00:12.429 --> 00:14.546
You wanna win this war,
we do it my way.

00:14.723 --> 00:16.483
When were you gonna tell me
you're kicking it

00:16.600 --> 00:18.216
with the ghost of Doc Holliday?

00:18.393 --> 00:21.932
Demons walk among us
and they mean to end my line.

00:22.105 --> 00:24.017
You don't wanna do this! No...

00:24.191 --> 00:27.150
- You have no idea what I want.
- Revenge.

00:27.319 --> 00:28.935
Seems like you're just my type.

00:29.112 --> 00:31.024
What makes you think
that you are mine?

00:32.991 --> 00:34.778
Willa?

00:38.539 --> 00:40.576
Willa!

00:47.256 --> 00:49.043
Willa!

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074

of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

01:21.999 --> 01:24.161
- Willa?
- It's Wynonna.

01:24.334 --> 01:27.122
Your sister,
the bag of chaos you live with?

01:33.594 --> 01:35.210
But this is...

01:35.387 --> 01:37.720
But Willa's gone - dead.

01:37.889 --> 01:40.131
I... I'm alive, right?

01:54.698 --> 01:56.906
Get them!

01:57.075 --> 01:59.192
Dude, I did! I have! Look!

02:00.662 --> 02:02.619
I killed them so hard.

02:02.789 --> 02:07.124
I... sent their creepy asses
back where they belong.

02:07.294 --> 02:10.252
- Not all of them.
- Not all of them...

02:11.840 --> 02:13.627
Willa?

02:16.219 --> 02:18.256
Willa, you can't be here.

02:19.890 --> 02:21.506
Daddy couldn't save us.

02:21.683 --> 02:24.016
How the hell will you?
They'll eat you alive.

02:36.907 --> 02:39.741
Here.

02:39.910 --> 02:41.526
You OK?

02:41.703 --> 02:44.411
Nan always said the prairie winds
bring in bad dreams.

02:44.581 --> 02:48.370
- Those are some brutal winds.
- Here, drink some water.

02:48.543 --> 02:50.409
Is it beer o'clock?

02:50.587 --> 02:53.330
Mix it with tomato juice
and it's breakfast.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.123
Only if you throw a raw egg

02:55.300 --> 02:57.667
and some horseradish
in there too, Daddy.

02:58.679 --> 03:01.137
Whoops-a-daisy.

03:05.435 --> 03:08.018
You can't keep doing this.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.771
Killing people and pretending
like it doesn't affect you.

03:12.317 --> 03:14.354
I'm more than halfway through
the Seven.

03:14.528 --> 03:17.737
Yeah, but there are, like, 77
in the curse, OK?

03:17.906 --> 03:20.239
You're barely 5% of the way in.

03:20.409 --> 03:22.196
You and your math both suck.

03:28.291 --> 03:30.157
You called out Willa's name.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.666
I miss her.

03:37.300 --> 03:40.464
I can't quite remember -
did she have pierced ears?

03:44.641 --> 03:46.428
Yeah.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.727
One piece at a time.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.812
That's how people slip away.

03:59.239 --> 04:02.152
Daddy said
revenge was a balm for the soul.

04:02.325 --> 04:04.738
If I kill the evil
that took him and our sister,

04:04.911 --> 04:07.745
then we can dream and remember
and it won't have to be sad.

04:11.001 --> 04:13.584
Try to get some sleep, OK?

04:14.588 --> 04:16.704
Tracking down revenants
can wait till morning.

05:07.599 --> 05:11.343
Two... three...

05:14.648 --> 05:16.731
I brought you a shirt,
so put your coffee back on.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.641
You know what I mean.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.609
The thermostat's broken.
Whole building.

05:23.782 --> 05:25.398
Furnace won't quit.

05:25.575 --> 05:28.818
Good. I thought I was suffering
some kind of pec-induced fever.

05:28.995 --> 05:31.157
What's on the agenda today?

05:31.331 --> 05:32.993
The city manager requested
a meeting,

05:33.166 --> 05:35.874
so I need you to put on
your grown-up face.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.706
I have one of those?

05:37.879 --> 05:40.542
This is the chief executive officer
of Purgatory.

05:40.715 --> 05:42.331
And a judge.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.171
It's not like he's the law.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.131
He decides who is the law.

05:46.304 --> 05:49.672
And... he could shut us down,

05:49.850 --> 05:51.637
so we need to be
on his good side.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.426
Alright.

05:53.603 --> 05:56.971
So get yourself chest already...
dressed already.

05:57.148 --> 05:58.908
Don't wanna keep
judgey manager dude waiting.

05:58.984 --> 06:00.600
Cryderman.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.689
Let's not keep
Judge Cryderman waiting.

06:04.573 --> 06:08.066
Record scratch. Judge who?

06:09.160 --> 06:11.527
I've been meaning
to call you in,

06:11.705 --> 06:14.869
but we've had
some unfortunate issues

06:15.041 --> 06:16.657
with the town planner.

06:16.835 --> 06:19.202
Is that the man that lost his arm
in the bike accident?

06:19.379 --> 06:22.838
- Some things just work out.
- Of course.

06:23.008 --> 06:25.500
Judge, you have a terrific town here
and my partner and I

06:25.677 --> 06:27.293
want to help make sure
it stays that way.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.086
Exactly.

06:29.264 --> 06:31.631
And that's why I wanna know
what the hell you're doing here.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.424
Well, as you know,
the US Marshals...

06:33.602 --> 06:36.219
Yeah, joint task force,
special assignment, et cetera.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.058
I know this.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.518
The Crydermans have been
in Purgatory for over 140 years

06:40.692 --> 06:42.308
and we like to keep tabs.

06:42.485 --> 06:44.147
It's a small-town thing.

06:44.321 --> 06:46.187
Are criminals, drug dealers
and gangbangers

06:46.364 --> 06:48.151
a small-town thing too?

06:49.242 --> 06:53.407
As a judge, you always wonder
where the bad seeds end up.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.198
Turns out,
right back here in my office.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.207
Where do you think
Bobo Del Rey will end up?

06:59.377 --> 07:01.414
Or do you not keep tabs on him?

07:01.588 --> 07:05.923
Mr Del Rey may not be an Ivy Leaguer,
but he's no moron.

07:06.092 --> 07:08.550
To be honest, Judge,
I'm less concerned about Bobo's IQ

07:08.720 --> 07:10.960
and more concerned about
his potential criminal activity.

07:11.014 --> 07:13.552
What criminal activity?

07:16.436 --> 07:18.348
This crate was delivered
to his trailer.

07:18.521 --> 07:20.601
- I took the photo this morning.
- Could be anything.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.807
Then why are his colleagues
guarding it with guns?

07:22.984 --> 07:24.744
He has connections.
You know what that means?

07:24.819 --> 07:27.857
It means trouble. But only if
we overstep our bounds.

07:28.031 --> 07:30.819
I don't like extra work
cluttering things up.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.735
- Especially during duck season.
- You know what I've heard?

07:33.912 --> 07:35.632
There's a bumper crop
of mallards this year.

07:35.705 --> 07:37.287
You a duck-huntin' man?

07:37.457 --> 07:39.619
Maybe I'll give you a call
on migration day.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.409
You give us a chance to prove

07:41.586 --> 07:43.397
that Bobo's heading up
a criminal conspiracy...

07:43.421 --> 07:46.539
I'll have
a thermos of bourbon at the ready.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.131
Can we get back to business here?

07:51.304 --> 07:53.261
I'll have a warrant sent over
within the hour.

07:53.431 --> 07:55.297
Thank you very much, Judge.

07:55.475 --> 07:59.685
It's a shame
what went south with this girl.

07:59.854 --> 08:01.846
Born bad, I think.

08:02.023 --> 08:03.685
Her daddy was a real legend.

08:03.858 --> 08:07.147
I'm just glad
the dead rest easy.

08:11.491 --> 08:14.199
Gum? Might take the taste of
judge anus out of your mouth.

08:14.369 --> 08:16.201
Look, I know you got a history
with the judge,

08:16.371 --> 08:18.613
but we hit jackpot -
a search warrant.

08:19.708 --> 08:21.449
I'm a 27-year-old woman
cursed with shooting

08:21.626 --> 08:24.209
demon-adjacent revenants
who bleed frothing brown goo

08:24.379 --> 08:26.496
and now I have to worry about
search warrants?

08:26.673 --> 08:29.711
This is all the warrant I need.
And Bobo's an easy target.

08:29.884 --> 08:32.342
You know what happens
if you shoot Bobo in a trailer park

08:32.511 --> 08:34.595
filled with humans,
women and children, right?

08:34.764 --> 08:36.676
One more check mark
on my to-do list?

08:36.850 --> 08:39.967
Someone records him being sucked
into the ground, puts it online,

08:40.145 --> 08:41.760
it goes viral.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.738
The government bombs
the Ghost River Triangle,

08:43.773 --> 08:45.389
conspiracy theorists go mad

08:45.567 --> 08:47.809
and you spend the remainder
of your days in a psych ward.

08:47.986 --> 08:50.103
Oh, if you're not dead already.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.856
So we do it by the stupid book.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.492
You, me and a collection
of local finest.

08:57.495 --> 09:00.408
We get to use legit cops?
Dolls, you could've led with that.

09:02.751 --> 09:05.243
Waverly will stake the place out
during the raid,

09:05.420 --> 09:07.958
photograph anyone she sees,
Doc will come down

09:08.131 --> 09:10.339
and see if he recognises
anyone from the old days.

09:10.508 --> 09:13.000
- Cryderman know about this?
- Shh.

09:14.137 --> 09:17.301
- Nope.
- Oh, there is a little rebel in there.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.261
Mmm, not that little.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.232
What, is there
a sale on lawn chairs?

09:32.405 --> 09:34.192
Park's looking mighty empty.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.031
Hey, you find any clippers
in there?

09:44.209 --> 09:46.326
I got this hangnail
that's just driving me nuts.

09:59.516 --> 10:01.803
While you're down there,
Deputy Whatever-the-Hell Earp...

10:03.436 --> 10:05.348
my knobs need some polishing.

10:06.481 --> 10:08.841
Actually, there's a lot here
that could use a woman's touch.

10:08.983 --> 10:11.270
Officer, could you take him
outside, please?

10:12.821 --> 10:14.653
- Now.
- Alright.

10:20.745 --> 10:23.283
He's clearly a criminal,
so where's the stuff to prove it?

10:23.456 --> 10:25.072
Time to regroup.

10:25.250 --> 10:27.993
Something's wrong, Dolls.
I feel it.

10:30.672 --> 10:32.584
Back...

10:34.843 --> 10:37.256
Doc...

10:39.013 --> 10:40.845
Die!

10:42.016 --> 10:45.760
Wooden crate -
five feet by two by one.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.604
Not ringin' any bells.

10:50.608 --> 10:54.352
I saw you receive it.
Where's it at? What's in it?

10:54.529 --> 10:57.112
Oh, yeah. Um...

10:57.282 --> 10:58.898
No, still not ringing.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.442
I think it's time that I talk
to some of your friends.

11:01.619 --> 11:03.235
Where can I find them?

11:03.413 --> 11:05.621
Big sale on yoga mats
down at Lululemon.

11:06.708 --> 11:08.908
He's just gonna keep jerking us
around. This won't work.

11:08.960 --> 11:13.045
You in the mood to take a trip
downtown, Bobo?

11:14.757 --> 11:16.623
Easy, boys.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.633
I'm think I'm comfy right here.

11:18.803 --> 11:21.841
But maybe Deputy Earp over there

11:22.015 --> 11:24.052
might want to give me
a little underdoggy,

11:24.225 --> 11:26.638
get the breeze going?

11:34.861 --> 11:36.523
Uh-oh.

11:36.696 --> 11:40.531
All I want are the scumbags
who came for Ward Earp.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.692
Two of them are still alive.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.701
Tell me who they are
and we leave you alone.

11:44.871 --> 11:45.952
Get down!

11:46.122 --> 11:48.580
Wynonna's going
all Wynonna again.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.912
Two choices. You can help me...

11:51.085 --> 11:52.246
Deputy Earp!

11:52.420 --> 11:54.582
Or you can not help me, and die.

11:59.344 --> 12:00.926
Really?

12:01.095 --> 12:03.633
You can't arrest me, Mr Dolls.

12:03.806 --> 12:06.514
- Ugh!
- Ahh!

12:10.855 --> 12:12.847
Once it's done, it's done.

12:13.024 --> 12:15.186
There will be no mercy for you.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.522
Thanks for the tip.

12:27.372 --> 12:31.366
Oh, shit.

12:40.969 --> 12:43.006
Find -
distance to Puerto Vallarta.

12:43.179 --> 12:46.547
Total distance 2,696 miles

12:46.724 --> 12:48.556
or one day and 19 hours.

12:48.726 --> 12:50.433
Begin guidance?

12:50.603 --> 12:53.516
This shit would just follow me
to the beach anyway.

12:58.319 --> 13:02.154
Hey, look, evidence Bobo can't
get his porn off the Net.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.155
Resisting arrest,
resisting arrest,

13:04.325 --> 13:06.237
possession for half an ounce.

13:06.411 --> 13:07.993
Pot brownie.

13:08.162 --> 13:10.322
And don't think I wasn't tempted
to eat it coming back.

13:10.373 --> 13:12.184
You know none of these charges
will stick, right?

13:12.208 --> 13:14.621
This is what happens when
you go cowboy. We got nothing.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.832
We blew it.
And now I gotta cover for you.

13:18.006 --> 13:20.623
- You don't have to do anything.
- I have to do my job.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.416
When are you gonna get it,
Wynonna?

13:22.593 --> 13:26.212
I'm not a cop, Dolls. OK?
So just let me do things my way.

13:26.389 --> 13:28.096
Your way isn't working.

13:28.266 --> 13:31.009
You think I don't get worked up
over these bastards same as you?

13:31.185 --> 13:34.553
- Who knows what you feel, Dolls.
- I have to deal with Cryderman.

13:35.565 --> 13:38.148
- Well, I'll come with you.
- No.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.401
You've done enough damage
for one day.

13:44.615 --> 13:46.255
Waverly said the trailer park
was so empty

13:46.409 --> 13:48.178
it looked like
Sharknado had ripped through it.

13:48.202 --> 13:50.364
So, sounds like
Bobo was tipped off.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.880
It's about time.

14:02.050 --> 14:03.791
I'm starved.
Just set it on the table.

14:03.968 --> 14:05.800
I'm not your lunch.

14:08.181 --> 14:11.015
- Least I hope not.
- Well, come in, come in.

14:12.602 --> 14:14.218
To what do I owe...

14:14.395 --> 14:16.512
Who told you I was watching you?

14:18.274 --> 14:22.564
Huh? Nobody else knew
where I was. Nobody.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.192
You're shorter than I remember.

14:28.451 --> 14:30.909
And you're taller
than I remember.

14:34.624 --> 14:36.411
Sit.

14:45.343 --> 14:51.510
Why, when I was little, did you
choose me to manipulate? Huh?

14:51.682 --> 14:53.469
Because I was gullible?

14:55.061 --> 14:57.144
- Weak?
- Weak...

14:58.356 --> 15:00.564
is something you've never been.

15:02.985 --> 15:04.817
I...

15:05.905 --> 15:07.737
chose you...

15:09.158 --> 15:10.774
because you were angry.

15:10.952 --> 15:14.195
- I wasn't angry.
- You sure?

15:14.372 --> 15:16.113
I'm NOT, OK?

15:16.290 --> 15:20.910
You've got depths that neither
of us know the bottom of yet.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.629
- Trust me.
- You don't know anything about me.

15:24.799 --> 15:26.756
Oh?

15:26.926 --> 15:28.758
Except maybe what happened
to Willa.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.298
Nothing good.

15:34.308 --> 15:35.890
Get out.

15:37.478 --> 15:39.094
Goodbye.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.933
Well, now there, then,
isn't my dance card full?

15:55.496 --> 15:57.112
Privacy,

15:57.290 --> 15:59.373
finally.

15:59.542 --> 16:01.158
But something tells me

16:01.335 --> 16:03.748
you're not here to give me
a lap dance, are you?

16:04.755 --> 16:08.795
It's a shame to waste
those beautiful tits of yours.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.460
Thank you, Bobo,

16:11.637 --> 16:13.754
for making this so damn easy.

16:13.931 --> 16:15.923
And what would that be,
sweetheart?

16:19.187 --> 16:20.803
Blowing a giant hole
in your head.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.814
OK, Wynonna,
you don't wanna do this.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.600
And I don't want to die.

16:26.777 --> 16:28.564
I can't die.

16:29.614 --> 16:31.401
At least, I'd rather not.

16:33.034 --> 16:34.650
You're a hot mess
in tight jeans.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.740
You want to pump bullets
into my head?

16:37.914 --> 16:40.122
I got some bullets I'd like to
pump into you too.

16:40.291 --> 16:43.284
- Yeah, eat shit.
- Or maybe your pretty sister.

16:43.461 --> 16:45.043
Watch your mouth.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.622
You watch your mouth.

16:48.799 --> 16:50.916
You think those shoulders
are heavy now?

16:51.093 --> 16:56.259
You wait until everyone you love
is in agony.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.854
Don't say another word, Robert.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.693
Ms Stone.

17:17.203 --> 17:20.867
Hey! You're releasing him?
On whose authority?

17:26.337 --> 17:29.250
You have a lawyer?

17:40.393 --> 17:42.180
Don't you start.

17:42.353 --> 17:44.345
Bad time to ask you for a lift?

17:45.690 --> 17:47.477
I guess so.

17:52.029 --> 17:53.691
Dick.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.691
No sudden moves.

17:57.868 --> 17:59.905
You're gonna give me
your cell phone.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.116
OK.

18:02.290 --> 18:04.407
Here.

18:05.668 --> 18:07.284
I saw how you handled
Bobo's guys.

18:07.461 --> 18:09.077
Now we're gonna pay him
another visit.

18:09.255 --> 18:10.917
I was just thinking
I need another man

18:11.090 --> 18:13.252
to tell me what to do today,
and here you are.

18:13.426 --> 18:16.043
- Awesome.
- Not to be rude, but cut the chitchat.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.930
- I get carsick real bad.
- Absolutely. Anything else?

18:20.099 --> 18:21.886
Drive-through fro-yo?
Slurpee run?

18:22.059 --> 18:23.721
Just drive.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.604
Now, that girl needs
a cigarillo.

18:46.709 --> 18:48.701
Del Rey and his lawyers
are considering suing

18:48.878 --> 18:50.619
for unreasonable
search and seizure.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.941
- Know what that means?
- Insufficient cause for action.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.831
And my name gets dragged
through the mud

18:55.009 --> 18:56.625
by some overpaid battle-axe.

18:56.802 --> 18:58.418
What can I do, sir?

18:58.596 --> 19:00.258
I'll get the lawyer back
before 5:00.

19:00.431 --> 19:02.889
You draft an apology
and personally deliver it.

19:03.059 --> 19:05.802
- Bring your protégée.
- Protégée?

19:06.812 --> 19:08.553
You hire somebody for their ass,

19:08.731 --> 19:10.347
you're responsible
for covering it.

19:10.524 --> 19:12.561
- That's out of line, sir.
- I disagree.

19:12.735 --> 19:14.522
And don't ask me
for another warrant

19:14.695 --> 19:16.455
unless there's something there
worth finding.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.230
Something was there.

19:18.407 --> 19:21.320
And for some reason,
Bobo was a step ahead of us.

19:24.205 --> 19:27.164
If I need to move up the
chain of command... Please.

19:27.333 --> 19:30.076
Your superiors have been
calling me, Deputy Marshal,

19:30.252 --> 19:32.084
asking if,
given your lack of results,

19:32.254 --> 19:34.120
I think you should continue
in your position.

19:34.298 --> 19:35.960
Really?

19:37.134 --> 19:38.591
Who you been talking to?

19:48.020 --> 19:49.807
What should I tell them?

20:01.992 --> 20:03.984
Get your hands
on your stupid little head.

20:04.161 --> 20:06.118
Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick.

20:06.288 --> 20:10.498
Nope, it passed. Don't shoot.
I know who attacked your family.

20:10.668 --> 20:13.331
Oh! Did you see us?
That was awesome!

20:13.504 --> 20:16.087
Hey, we saw you leaving the cop shop
driving like a maniac so...

20:16.257 --> 20:18.624
- Oh, shit.
- Names. Now.

20:18.801 --> 20:21.885
OK, thing is, I don't exactly
have their names.

20:22.054 --> 20:25.092
But I have a picture of all seven.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.638
Standing by
your dad's dead body.

20:28.811 --> 20:31.349
If you wanna know
who's been killing the heirs,

20:31.522 --> 20:33.104
who'll eventually come
for you...

20:34.108 --> 20:36.145
Fish?!

20:36.318 --> 20:39.686
That is you!

20:39.864 --> 20:42.902
- You old sonofagun!
- Well, dang my melt!

20:43.075 --> 20:46.318
It's Doc Holliday!

20:47.371 --> 20:49.158
Dang, boy!

20:51.250 --> 20:56.245
You do not call me
to deal with your petty affairs.

20:58.007 --> 21:04.129
Next time, I expect it to be
for my reasons.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.893
I hear them.

21:20.070 --> 21:22.312
They call and they call,

21:22.490 --> 21:24.277
they cry and they cry.

21:25.659 --> 21:28.823
They won't stop.
Why won't they stop?

21:28.996 --> 21:30.612
My head...

21:30.790 --> 21:33.533
We're getting close, Constance.

21:35.085 --> 21:40.501
Or should I call you
by your alias, Ms Stone?

21:42.051 --> 21:43.838
Arrgh!

21:46.305 --> 21:49.423
It's Mrs Clootie.

21:50.518 --> 21:52.134
Ugh!

21:56.565 --> 22:00.525
Now, tell me,

22:00.694 --> 22:04.734
what is it with you
and those damn Earp girls?

22:06.575 --> 22:09.158
You're ridiculous.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.139
Always chasing one of them
with your tongue out.

22:11.163 --> 22:13.530
Suck it up, revenant.

22:13.707 --> 22:15.243
All of it.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.168
You wanna know power?

22:20.756 --> 22:24.249
Suck... it up.

22:27.137 --> 22:30.676
Dang, boy, you look good!

22:30.850 --> 22:33.308
What happened? You and Wyatt
was thick as thieves.

22:33.477 --> 22:36.060
- How come he turned you revenant?
- He didn't.

22:36.230 --> 22:39.519
I'm still me. Except not.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.854
Not to mention
a sight for sore eyes!

22:42.027 --> 22:45.145
Trout, Pickerel, whatever
your name is. Can we focus?

22:46.365 --> 22:48.106
Doc, don't you feel
a tad thirsty?

22:48.284 --> 22:51.368
Well, if you're buyin',
I am always thirsty.

22:55.833 --> 22:57.540
So, about this picture.

22:57.710 --> 23:01.203
I saw you at the trailer park,
standing up to Bobo,

23:01.380 --> 23:02.996
and I knew you could help me.

23:03.173 --> 23:06.086
- With?
- Got caught up in a scheme.

23:06.260 --> 23:09.048
Somebody I love. I was weak.

23:09.221 --> 23:11.213
Some chick turn you to
a life of crime?

23:11.390 --> 23:13.347
Haven't heard that song before.

23:14.351 --> 23:17.014
It wasn't a chick.

23:17.187 --> 23:18.928
Oh, OK. Yep.

23:19.106 --> 23:21.348
Life could be pretty lonely
for a fella like me.

23:21.525 --> 23:24.142
Back in those days.
You can imagine.

23:24.320 --> 23:28.485
And then, the most beautiful man
I'd ever seen.

23:28.657 --> 23:31.775
A photographer. Daguerreotypes.
You know what those are?

23:31.952 --> 23:34.319
- Old-timey pictures, right?
- Mmm.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.121
He walked right up to me
on the street.

23:37.291 --> 23:39.578
He was so bold that way.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.368
Sold me on getting
my photo done.

23:41.545 --> 23:43.753
You had to sit completely still.

23:43.923 --> 23:45.563
My stomach was fluttering
something awful.

23:45.716 --> 23:48.880
And we just stared
at each other.

23:49.053 --> 23:51.170
And stared.

23:51.347 --> 23:53.304
By the time the photo
was finished...

23:53.474 --> 23:55.511
How 'blarfably' romantic.

23:56.602 --> 24:00.391
We promised that if we were ever
struck down by 'Peacemaker',

24:00.564 --> 24:02.226
next time we regenerated,

24:02.399 --> 24:05.312
we'd meet same day,
time and place.

24:05.486 --> 24:08.274
- So, what, he didn't show?
- I went to the trailer park.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.607
All folk knew was that
he'd struck some deal with Bobo,

24:10.699 --> 24:12.190
a deal that went bad.

24:13.202 --> 24:16.115
Which brings us to you in my truck
and a knife at my throat.

24:16.288 --> 24:19.031
I need to know if he's OK.
Or not.

24:20.042 --> 24:22.329
And if we could find out,

24:22.503 --> 24:24.165
I'd die a happy man.

24:24.338 --> 24:26.955
You shoot me 10 times
if you want.

24:28.884 --> 24:30.671
You really have
a photo of the Seven?

24:31.679 --> 24:33.921
My fella took
all their hunting photos.

24:34.098 --> 24:37.182
Them with their 'trophies' -
the heirs.

24:38.185 --> 24:40.768
So I help you...

24:40.938 --> 24:42.725
I help you back.

24:48.028 --> 24:50.111
You're gonna want to talk
to Vinnie.

24:50.280 --> 24:53.068
He's alone at a crab shack.

24:59.039 --> 25:01.156
Whoa. So?

25:02.167 --> 25:04.284
I'm paying a visit
to a guy named Vinnie.

25:04.461 --> 25:06.373
Vinnie the Vulture?

25:06.547 --> 25:09.415
Wynonna, he don't give up
information so easy.

25:09.591 --> 25:11.674
I'll get it out of him
any way I need to.

25:11.844 --> 25:14.382
Have you ever tortured anyone
before?

25:14.555 --> 25:16.217
Does six-year-old Waverly count?
'Cause...

25:16.390 --> 25:18.006
Hurtin' and killin', Wynonna,

25:18.183 --> 25:20.891
they are two
very different things.

25:22.062 --> 25:23.849
Yeah. I got this.

25:25.315 --> 25:27.773
Alone?

25:27.943 --> 25:31.277
Look, you stay here and
keep an eye on your little friend.

25:31.447 --> 25:35.532
If this is a trap and I die,
gut him.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.411
So you weren't expecting guests?

25:48.589 --> 25:51.206
Why you wanna find
some brokeback nancy's boyfriend

25:51.383 --> 25:52.999
anyway?

25:53.177 --> 25:55.510
- Why is it your problem?
- I made a promise.

25:55.679 --> 25:57.341
A deal.

25:57.514 --> 25:59.972
I'm trying to become the type
of woman who keeps her word.

26:00.142 --> 26:03.180
Oh, you have a code?
That's cute.

26:04.730 --> 26:08.223
Don't make me hurt you.
Where's the photographer?

26:09.234 --> 26:13.103
Earps, always trying to cut
filthy little deals

26:13.280 --> 26:14.942
whenever it suits them.

26:22.498 --> 26:24.285
This is the good part.

26:28.295 --> 26:30.912
- Dad?
- You enjoy yourself, baby girl.

26:31.924 --> 26:34.166
Vengeance is fun.

26:34.343 --> 26:36.175
It's what we live for.

26:37.554 --> 26:41.173
Nice party trick,
but Ward didn't sound like that.

26:43.477 --> 26:45.093
I just need information.

26:45.270 --> 26:48.138
Mm-hm.
You keep telling yourself that.

26:48.315 --> 26:50.398
As long as you're having fun...

26:50.567 --> 26:52.524
No!

26:54.530 --> 26:56.522
Where is the photographer?

26:56.698 --> 26:58.655
Oh, now, don't wuss out, honey.

26:58.826 --> 27:01.660
Why don't you go for the wrist
or the neck?

27:01.829 --> 27:03.946
I'm not trying to kill him.

27:04.123 --> 27:06.490
It'll make you feel better.
For a while.

27:06.667 --> 27:08.784
Then you'll have to kill another,
but that's OK.

27:08.961 --> 27:10.793
It kept me busy. I loved it.

27:10.963 --> 27:13.080
You're not my dad!

27:13.257 --> 27:15.670
Now tell me what I need to know!

27:17.594 --> 27:19.176
Tell me.

27:19.346 --> 27:20.928
- Arrgh! Ahh!
- Tell me.

27:21.098 --> 27:23.306
- Tell me!
- Hell's Gate!

27:23.475 --> 27:26.764
Bobo had Doc take Levi
over Hell's Gate.

27:27.771 --> 27:30.013
Across the line, so he'd fry.

27:30.190 --> 27:32.398
To torture him,
teach him a lesson.

27:32.568 --> 27:34.730
Doc Holliday?

27:34.903 --> 27:36.690
Levi begged and begged him
to stop.

27:36.864 --> 27:39.481
You would have loved it.

27:39.658 --> 27:42.526
Go on,
don't stop now. 'Cause we won't.

27:42.703 --> 27:45.787
Not until you're in pieces,
like your big sister, Willa.

27:47.541 --> 27:49.328
OK.

27:51.420 --> 27:54.629
Mmm!

27:56.383 --> 27:58.750
You OK?

27:59.970 --> 28:01.757
I know where he is.

28:02.764 --> 28:05.507
Vinnie told me
where Bobo put him.

28:05.684 --> 28:08.347
I can take you there, but I get
my photo of the Seven first.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.102
Sure.

28:10.272 --> 28:11.934
Thing is,
we might need to commit

28:12.107 --> 28:15.646
a little tiny break-and-enter
to get our hands on it.

28:15.819 --> 28:18.653
- Where, Fish?
- Basement of the civic building.

28:18.822 --> 28:20.484
That's the police station.

28:20.657 --> 28:23.024
You want me to break into
the place I work?

28:24.328 --> 28:26.536
Yeah, OK. I'm surprised
it took me this long.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.367
If we can get our hands on
some dynamite,

28:28.540 --> 28:30.122
scale the north wall...

28:30.292 --> 28:32.532
- I got something better.
- What is better than dynamite?

28:32.628 --> 28:34.620
Boobs.

28:40.761 --> 28:44.471
Ohh! How do you boys work
in this heat?

28:47.809 --> 28:50.426
Ladies. Even better.

28:50.604 --> 28:52.812
I wonder if you might be able
to help me out?

28:53.941 --> 28:56.024
No? Nothing?

28:56.193 --> 28:57.809
OK. Yeah.

28:57.986 --> 29:01.354
Pardon me, ladies,
but I seem to have gotten myself

29:01.531 --> 29:03.864
the tiniest bit lost.

29:05.786 --> 29:08.244
In short, ma'am, my partner and I
sincerely apologise

29:08.413 --> 29:10.029
for the embarrassment
of Mr Del Rey

29:10.207 --> 29:12.047
for our unnecessary
and unprofessional conduct.

29:12.125 --> 29:13.912
Mmm.

29:15.212 --> 29:17.374
Where is his partner?

29:17.547 --> 29:19.709
Surely you know
I cannot consider this

29:19.883 --> 29:22.296
a full and plenary quittance.

29:22.469 --> 29:26.383
Now, now, CC, surely you know
our whole municipal system

29:26.556 --> 29:28.172
can't be held accountable

29:28.350 --> 29:30.137
for every halfwit
who goes off half-cocked.

29:30.310 --> 29:32.973
Dolls?

29:33.146 --> 29:36.765
We do our best to maintain
discipline in the ranks, ma'am.

29:36.942 --> 29:38.774
Ms Earp is a lowlife.

29:38.944 --> 29:40.560
But we can't be responsible.

29:40.737 --> 29:42.774
Deputy Marshal Dolls knows
he's made a mistake.

29:42.948 --> 29:45.941
Wynonna is an unconventional
vital asset to my team.

29:46.118 --> 29:48.861
She is a survivor
that never gives up.

29:50.038 --> 29:53.202
And we could do with fewer
child abusers behind the bench.

29:53.375 --> 29:55.082
<i>Warning - the building is now under</i>

29:55.252 --> 29:57.084
<i>a carbon monoxide evacuation.</i>

29:57.254 --> 29:59.462
<i>Please exit in a calm
and orderly manner.</i>

29:59.631 --> 30:02.840
<i>If you are dizzy or weak,
inform a co-worker now.</i>

30:03.010 --> 30:06.799
I've got some phone calls
to make to your bosses.

30:07.889 --> 30:10.006
Do whatever you like.

30:10.183 --> 30:13.301
And your bourbon's for shit.

30:16.064 --> 30:18.647
Uh, alarm!

30:18.817 --> 30:22.106
- You need to evacuate.
- Uh, this just doesn't make sense to me.

30:22.279 --> 30:24.646
Sense? Carbon monoxide!

30:24.823 --> 30:26.780
Colourless, odourless, lethal?

30:26.950 --> 30:28.612
Not to be hurtful,
but I know better

30:28.785 --> 30:30.401
than to take anything
at face value

30:30.579 --> 30:32.241
when there's an Earp
in the vicinity.

30:32.414 --> 30:34.872
Especially if they're claiming
to look out for you.

30:38.503 --> 30:40.290
Nice. Good instincts, Dickenson.

30:40.464 --> 30:42.251
We better shake a leg.

30:45.135 --> 30:46.922
Hello?

30:51.183 --> 30:54.517
So this is
the Black Badge Division.

30:59.566 --> 31:02.809
My, my. Dolls has been busy.

31:04.112 --> 31:07.401
- You looking for something?
- Goddamn. It's you.

31:14.706 --> 31:16.823
How was it down there?

31:17.000 --> 31:18.662
Chilly, I bet.

31:18.835 --> 31:21.703
One burnin' thought
kept me warm.

31:22.714 --> 31:24.455
Uhh!

31:25.634 --> 31:29.799
John Henry Holliday.

32:00.335 --> 32:02.827
Yo, Fish.

32:03.004 --> 32:05.462
The problem with
this whole criminal thing

32:05.632 --> 32:07.248
is that it's kinda fun.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.042
That is one of the problems, Fish.

32:09.219 --> 32:12.383
But there are other...

32:16.393 --> 32:18.180
bigger problems.

32:22.149 --> 32:24.106
Run. Thank you!

32:40.625 --> 32:43.105
- You get your precious photos?
- It's just a box of negatives.

32:43.211 --> 32:44.827
We have to find someplace
to develop...

32:45.005 --> 32:47.873
No. No, you take me to him now.

32:48.049 --> 32:49.790
Gear down, bro. We have a deal.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.630
I can't live like this.

32:51.803 --> 32:54.341
Not anymore, not knowing...

32:54.514 --> 32:57.848
Please, God, Wynonna,
you had your way with the Vulture.

32:58.018 --> 32:59.884
Are you going to torture me too?

33:00.061 --> 33:02.178
The dates on the negatives
match up.

33:05.692 --> 33:07.775
Yeah, fine, OK.
We'll take you to Levi.

33:07.944 --> 33:10.482
Well, to where Vinnie said
he was at least.

33:10.655 --> 33:12.271
- Levi?
- Oh, thank you.

33:12.449 --> 33:13.985
Thank you, thank you.

33:16.119 --> 33:17.735
So Vinnie wasn't lying.

33:17.913 --> 33:20.451
And don't tell me you just know
Levi from the good old days.

33:20.624 --> 33:22.240
Oh, I wouldn't dare.

33:22.417 --> 33:24.409
But the name should ring a bell
with you too

33:24.586 --> 33:26.418
'cause the last time
you saw him,

33:26.588 --> 33:29.126
he'd gotten himself mixed up
with a shadow assassin.

33:32.135 --> 33:33.967
That guy?

33:42.270 --> 33:44.808
- He's here? You're sure?
- Don't get your hopes up.

33:44.981 --> 33:46.597
We don't know
what we're gonna find.

33:46.775 --> 33:48.767
Fish, you cross that line

33:48.944 --> 33:50.901
and you will live
a thousand lifetimes of agony.

33:51.071 --> 33:53.939
But you can cross, though.
Right?

33:55.951 --> 33:57.783
Whatever we happen upon,

33:57.953 --> 34:00.320
I think we should tell Fish
we didn't find anything.

34:00.497 --> 34:02.113
I don't give a rat's ass

34:02.290 --> 34:04.122
if he's a pile of carrion -
we made a deal.

34:04.292 --> 34:05.908
Have you seen
what happens to revenants

34:06.086 --> 34:07.748
that cross
the Ghost River boundary?

34:09.255 --> 34:11.373
Not up close.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.337
But you have.

34:14.886 --> 34:16.502
Well, it ain't gonna be pretty.

34:22.268 --> 34:23.885
Clearly.

34:24.062 --> 34:26.382
I should've gone for Puerto Vallarta
when I had the chance.

34:32.821 --> 34:34.621
The revenant steps over the line
for a second,

34:34.739 --> 34:36.355
it's pure torture for them.

34:36.533 --> 34:39.150
So what happens when you leave them
staked out here for days?

34:40.620 --> 34:42.452
It wasn't my idea to do this.

34:42.621 --> 34:44.454
Oh, well, the fact
that you were duped

34:44.623 --> 34:46.543
into doing Bobo's dirty work
makes it all better.

34:46.668 --> 34:48.909
Bobo wanted to make an example
of Levi

34:49.087 --> 34:50.748
so people wouldn't cross him.

34:50.922 --> 34:53.255
I do not have a Black Badge Division
backing me up,

34:53.425 --> 34:56.793
so I was not in a position
to be refusin'.

34:58.054 --> 34:59.886
He chewed off his foot
like an animal.

35:02.517 --> 35:04.304
Where's the rest of him?

35:05.312 --> 35:07.725
Well, looks like he crawled back
to safety.

35:07.897 --> 35:10.810
Hey, you guys, what's happening?

35:25.749 --> 35:27.786
This is the only way
to sanctuary.

35:40.805 --> 35:42.592
Fish?

36:01.910 --> 36:04.152
Just thought you'd want
to say goodbye.

36:08.083 --> 36:09.699
It's me.

36:11.836 --> 36:15.079
It's me. Ambrose.

36:16.174 --> 36:17.961
Your Ambrose.

36:19.386 --> 36:21.343
What did you do to Bobo?

36:22.597 --> 36:24.634
What did you do this time,
bad boy?

36:24.808 --> 36:27.175
You just could never
help yourself.

36:27.352 --> 36:29.435
No matter what I said,
you were gonna do wrong.

36:30.438 --> 36:32.304
Are you gonna tell him, Doc?

36:33.316 --> 36:35.148
Well, I reckon he knows.

36:37.779 --> 36:39.987
- Fish...
- Vengeance is hollow, Doc.

36:40.156 --> 36:41.943
Isn't worth a thing.

36:44.285 --> 36:45.947
I think it's time.

36:46.121 --> 36:47.862
You sure you're OK with this?

36:48.039 --> 36:49.871
It was always gonna end
this way.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.748
I don't want to live

36:51.918 --> 36:55.377
waiting for either of us
to be shot down by the heir.

36:55.547 --> 36:57.209
That's no life.

36:59.509 --> 37:01.296
So you've made your peace?

37:02.470 --> 37:04.448
You're gonna be the one
to break this curse, Wynonna.

37:04.472 --> 37:06.259
For all of us.

37:07.267 --> 37:08.849
And I thank you.

37:14.274 --> 37:16.186
I'm gonna count to three, OK?

37:20.864 --> 37:22.605
One...

37:42.510 --> 37:44.502
It's almost time, luvvies.

37:44.679 --> 37:48.218
Uncle Bobo is finding you.
All of you.

37:48.391 --> 37:50.883
And then it will be just like
we planned.

37:51.060 --> 37:53.097
That's enough, Constance.

37:53.271 --> 37:55.729
- Let's not get hysterical.
- Let me take them.

37:55.899 --> 37:58.858
They'll be happier with me.
Won't you let me?

38:03.782 --> 38:06.240
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

38:07.786 --> 38:10.870
What I would like, Connie...

38:12.832 --> 38:14.414
is for the lead

38:14.584 --> 38:16.166
to get out of this
goddamned prison.

38:16.336 --> 38:19.920
My lead that you've been
promising me for years.

38:22.926 --> 38:24.838
Tit for tat.

38:26.429 --> 38:28.421
Like we've always said.

38:30.850 --> 38:34.594
I put your boys back together,

38:34.771 --> 38:36.433
you give me that lead.

38:38.316 --> 38:41.775
By the by,
when were you gonna tell me.

38:41.945 --> 38:45.438
Doc Holliday was back
amongst the living?

38:46.825 --> 38:48.441
When were you gonna tell me

38:48.618 --> 38:51.156
he scares the living shit
out of you?

38:53.289 --> 38:54.905
You had no right!

38:55.083 --> 38:56.699
I did what was right!

38:56.876 --> 38:59.104
Right woulda been shooting that thing
and us running for it.

38:59.128 --> 39:00.744
He wasn't always a thing, Doc.

39:00.922 --> 39:02.538
And if I'm gonna keep
killing them

39:02.715 --> 39:04.475
and not go crazy,
I need more than revenge...

39:04.509 --> 39:06.125
Goddammit, Wynonna!
They're bad people.

39:06.302 --> 39:07.918
So I just ignore
they're people at all?

39:08.096 --> 39:09.712
I spent over 100 years
in the dark,

39:09.889 --> 39:12.131
at the bottom of
a dried-up old well.

39:12.308 --> 39:14.766
Do you know what thought
I turned over and over in my head?

39:14.936 --> 39:16.552
What I lived on?

39:16.729 --> 39:19.221
The sheer knowledge
that I would pay back

39:19.399 --> 39:22.016
the bitch that made me
what I am.

39:23.152 --> 39:24.768
This monster.

39:24.946 --> 39:28.314
- You're not a monster.
- But a lesser man than Fish.

39:28.491 --> 39:30.653
I saw her today.

39:31.744 --> 39:33.656
At least I think I did.
And she...

39:35.290 --> 39:38.499
Her power... I couldn't.

39:38.668 --> 39:41.331
That's why you stayed.
Not to help us.

39:41.504 --> 39:43.837
I staked that man out there.

39:44.007 --> 39:46.545
I knew what would happen to him
and I staked him still.

39:46.718 --> 39:49.711
Even worse, I would stake
every revenant in this world

39:49.888 --> 39:51.675
and most of the humans too

39:51.848 --> 39:54.431
if that's what it takes
to destroy Constance Clootie.

39:54.601 --> 39:58.185
Well, I need rules, Doc. A code.

39:58.354 --> 39:59.970
Otherwise I'll end up
just like you.

40:00.148 --> 40:03.141
Stop kidding yourself, Wynonna.
You are EXACTLY like me.

40:12.160 --> 40:15.904
- We can't.
- Shh. Say that after.

40:48.363 --> 40:51.071
- Is it of the Seven? Is it done?
- Not yet.

40:51.240 --> 40:53.448
Please hurry.
If Fish screwed me, I'm...

40:53.618 --> 40:57.111
Going to realise you shouldn't
have trusted him? Stop hovering.

40:57.288 --> 40:58.904
Or do you want to do this yourself?

40:59.082 --> 41:01.495
'Cause this isn't my vendetta.
It's my job.

41:01.668 --> 41:03.705
And I appreciate it.

41:03.878 --> 41:05.665
Are we good?

41:06.673 --> 41:08.289
Look, I killed three in a day.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.300
Including the one who helped us
get these pictures.

41:11.427 --> 41:14.044
And you know what?
He wasn't terrible.

41:14.222 --> 41:15.838
He looked into my eyes

41:16.015 --> 41:19.179
and I offered him a chance
to make peace.

41:20.186 --> 41:22.394
And I felt better.

41:22.563 --> 41:24.395
Great plan.

41:25.400 --> 41:27.753
Only thing is, revenants don't
understand what 'peace' means.

41:27.777 --> 41:29.860
Well, maybe only a few
take a shot at coming clean,

41:30.029 --> 41:31.691
but I gotta offer it.

41:31.864 --> 41:33.730
I can't fill up on revenge.

41:33.908 --> 41:35.524
I need some peace -

41:35.702 --> 41:38.069
for me, for my sister.

41:39.831 --> 41:41.493
You do it your way,
I'll do it mine.

41:41.666 --> 41:44.124
As long as we are pulling in
the same direction.

41:44.293 --> 41:46.080
Roughly.

41:47.463 --> 41:49.125
Take a look.

42:04.105 --> 42:06.688
- Can I take this?
- Mm-hm.

42:06.858 --> 42:08.975
As soon as you find
a picture of the Seven...

42:09.152 --> 42:11.269
Yeah, I'll call. Go.

42:21.956 --> 42:23.913
I feel like
I've seen this before.
