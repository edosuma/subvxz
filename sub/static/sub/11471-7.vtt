00:40.868 --> 00:43.419
Pardon the intrusion, gentlemen.

00:43.420 --> 00:46.456
William, good to see you.

00:46.457 --> 00:48.174
What brings you up from Baltimore?

00:48.175 --> 00:50.760
The board at Columbia
asked for a consultation

00:50.761 --> 00:53.179
on how best to teach surgery
to their medical students.

00:53.180 --> 00:56.799
- Aha.
- We're all the rage these days.

00:56.800 --> 01:00.553
William, let me introduce my
apprentice Dr. John Thackery.

01:00.554 --> 01:03.056
Thack, this is Dr. William Halsted.

01:03.057 --> 01:05.641
- Pleasure.
- Pleasure's all mine.

01:05.642 --> 01:08.978
I had the good fortune of
working with your colleague.

01:08.979 --> 01:11.981
Dr. Osler in Philadelphia a few years back.

01:11.982 --> 01:14.534
I know you're doing extraordinary things.

01:14.535 --> 01:16.369
Well, you're in good hands yourself.

01:16.370 --> 01:19.572
J.M. was always a step
ahead of me in school,

01:19.573 --> 01:21.657
in sport, and with the women.

01:21.658 --> 01:25.578
Well, Dr. Thackery might
best the both of us.

01:25.579 --> 01:29.048
In short order, he's proven
himself indispensable to the Knick.

01:29.049 --> 01:32.668
High praise from someone
notoriously stingy with it.

01:32.669 --> 01:35.171
After what you witness today,
you'll be praising this man

01:35.172 --> 01:38.758
in the hallways of your
hospital for years to come.

01:38.759 --> 01:41.644
Then let me take my seat
and let the games begin.

01:41.645 --> 01:43.962
Good luck, gentlemen.

01:47.317 --> 01:49.435
You didn't have to do that.

01:49.436 --> 01:51.020
I meant every word of it.

01:51.021 --> 01:53.906
You're a comet in the sky, young Thack.

01:53.907 --> 01:55.408
Embrace it.

01:55.409 --> 01:58.661
I just feel that the
surgery could very well fail.

01:58.662 --> 02:01.197
You've rehearsed it over and
over in the pathological lab.

02:01.198 --> 02:02.698
It will succeed brilliantly.

02:02.699 --> 02:04.534
We've got a full theater out there.

02:04.535 --> 02:08.253
Colleagues you've invited with the
promise of a great breakthrough today.

02:08.255 --> 02:11.791
A man whose life hangs in the balance.

02:11.792 --> 02:14.961
It could be the biggest
finding of my career

02:14.962 --> 02:16.879
or an absolute disaster.

02:16.880 --> 02:18.264
You're just nervous.

02:18.265 --> 02:20.266
I am. Aren't you?

02:20.267 --> 02:22.667
I won't be in a moment.

02:24.471 --> 02:27.557
I wonder what Halsted would
say if he knew about this.

02:27.558 --> 02:29.507
Who do you think told me about it?

02:31.028 --> 02:34.147
The appendix is a rudimentary,
functionless organ.

02:34.148 --> 02:36.566
A relic, really, and yet
it still has the power

02:36.567 --> 02:39.235
to fell a man in the prime of health

02:39.236 --> 02:43.072
and has proven a difficult adversary.

02:43.073 --> 02:46.576
The patient on the
table is 25. An attorney.

02:46.577 --> 02:48.911
No history of alcoholism or syphilis.

02:48.912 --> 02:50.830
He was perfectly fit until yesterday

02:50.831 --> 02:52.999
when he was struck down
with acute abdominal pain.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.419
Then Dr. Thackery quickly
deduced appendicitis.

02:56.420 --> 02:59.172
The pain has worsened, the fever risen.

02:59.173 --> 03:01.090
Vomiting began this morning.

03:01.091 --> 03:03.476
We could take the usual
course with therapeutics,

03:03.477 --> 03:05.394
but we know these yield poor results

03:05.395 --> 03:07.146
and most often death.

03:07.147 --> 03:09.849
It is my belief that there is a way

03:09.850 --> 03:13.603
to almost guarantee full recovery
in all appendicitis cases,

03:13.604 --> 03:17.305
and that is the complete
removal of the organ.

03:21.278 --> 03:22.778
They're ready.

03:22.779 --> 03:25.397
Let's give 'em a show.

03:26.667 --> 03:29.118
Dr. Thackery will make the first incision.

03:29.119 --> 03:32.538
In countless trials, Dr.
Thackery has devised a way

03:32.539 --> 03:36.008
in which to accurately determine
the location of the appendix,

03:36.009 --> 03:38.294
thus eliminating the estimation

03:38.295 --> 03:40.912
of where to make the initial incision.

03:41.965 --> 03:43.966
Dr. Thackery.

03:43.967 --> 03:46.134
Surgical knife.

03:47.638 --> 03:50.139
By drawing a line and
divining the midway point

03:50.140 --> 03:52.892
between the anterior-superior iliac spine

03:52.893 --> 03:54.560
and the umbilicus,

03:54.561 --> 03:57.446
parallel to the fibers
of the external oblique,

03:57.447 --> 04:01.433
no matter what the size
or sex of the patient...

04:04.238 --> 04:06.989
you will always find the appendix.

04:06.990 --> 04:08.874
And there it is.

04:08.875 --> 04:13.495
The Thackery Point never misses.

04:15.632 --> 04:18.216
Please, Johnny. Johnny, please.

04:18.218 --> 04:19.719
Please, Johnny.

04:45.662 --> 04:47.695
Hold his arms and legs.

05:08.051 --> 05:10.635
Get some towels.

05:11.772 --> 05:14.256
You should load up his bowl.

05:14.257 --> 05:16.058
He's gonna need something for the pain.

05:16.059 --> 05:18.561
And, uh...

05:18.562 --> 05:20.563
could you...

05:20.564 --> 05:23.264
load up a fresh one for me, please?

05:29.473 --> 05:32.307
Shh. Shh.

06:14.284 --> 06:17.002
Late night.

06:17.003 --> 06:19.672
Been watching you for
a while from over there.

06:19.673 --> 06:22.425
And I'm thinking you might
just be a clergyman's daughter

06:22.426 --> 06:24.176
out here on the street like you are.

06:24.177 --> 06:25.711
Pardon me?

06:25.712 --> 06:27.463
I got an offer for you.

06:27.464 --> 06:29.014
Could be good for both of us.

06:29.015 --> 06:31.600
I happen to be acquainted
with a Mr. Collier

06:31.601 --> 06:34.303
who takes very good care of girls like you.

06:34.304 --> 06:38.023
To have another dark one in his stable

06:38.024 --> 06:39.892
might be good for business, so I suppose...

06:39.893 --> 06:41.811
I ain't what you think I am.

06:41.812 --> 06:45.648
Sure. Sure.

06:45.649 --> 06:49.235
But might you be interested
in a little proposal?

06:49.236 --> 06:52.788
Make you some good money for what
you're doing out here already.

06:52.789 --> 06:55.658
What I'm doing out here
is waiting for someone.

06:55.659 --> 06:57.993
Well, maybe I'm that someone.

06:57.994 --> 07:00.663
That someone is my man and
I ain't no streetwalker.

07:00.664 --> 07:03.332
- You got that?
- The hell you think you're doing?

07:03.333 --> 07:04.967
He thinks I'm a street whore.

07:04.968 --> 07:07.919
- Hold on.
- Tried making me an offer.

07:08.972 --> 07:10.923
Trying to fuck my girl, is that it, Paddy?

07:10.924 --> 07:11.974
Back off, spooky.

07:11.975 --> 07:13.676
You don't want to start nothing with me.

07:13.677 --> 07:15.845
The hell I don't!

07:15.846 --> 07:17.930
Stop him!

07:17.931 --> 07:21.066
Come on.

07:21.067 --> 07:24.019
Hey, where you going? Hey,
somebody find that nigger!

07:24.020 --> 07:25.521
A doctor!

07:25.522 --> 07:28.439
Somebody run and get the doctor!

07:30.110 --> 07:32.528
One of youse call the surgeons.

07:32.529 --> 07:34.780
It's the cop Sears.

07:34.781 --> 07:38.417
He's been cut bad. Stabbed
by a dirty coon in the street.

07:38.418 --> 07:40.703
Come on.

07:43.874 --> 07:45.674
And up. All right.

07:45.675 --> 07:47.376
Now come back at me, ya gobdaw,

07:47.377 --> 07:50.095
I'll bust you to your knees and
make you lick the back of 'em.

07:50.096 --> 07:52.214
Back! Make way, we got real
working folk coming through.

07:52.215 --> 07:54.016
- What's all this about?
- Not a clue.

07:54.017 --> 07:55.634
They're boiling up about something.

07:55.635 --> 07:57.386
Interesting way to start
your first day back.

07:57.387 --> 08:00.922
It certainly is. Here, allow me. Come on.

08:11.284 --> 08:13.068
My apologies for my lateness.

08:13.069 --> 08:15.037
I was taking Eleanor to see her parents.

08:15.038 --> 08:17.490
There's no need to explain.
It's good to have you back.

08:17.491 --> 08:20.743
So we'll repair the hole
and re-inflate the lung

08:20.744 --> 08:22.411
once the bleeding has stopped.

08:22.412 --> 08:24.413
He'll have to make do
with the other one for now.

08:24.414 --> 08:26.614
Nurse Elkins, forehead, please.

08:29.753 --> 08:31.804
Me as well, Nurse.

08:31.805 --> 08:34.121
Suction.

08:40.096 --> 08:41.764
Tied off the hepatic artery,

08:41.765 --> 08:44.149
but the renal is going to
require significant repair.

08:44.150 --> 08:46.101
Well, let's do it.

08:46.102 --> 08:47.770
He'll need that blood flow

08:47.771 --> 08:50.155
or he's likely to become ischemic.

08:50.156 --> 08:51.774
You say you know him?

08:51.775 --> 08:54.193
Officer Sears. Good man.

08:54.194 --> 08:56.495
Used to go on calls
with Speight for the HD.

08:56.496 --> 08:59.615
And he's got a fine crowd
outside rooting him on to health.

08:59.616 --> 09:01.283
Never mind who they're rooting against.

09:01.284 --> 09:03.085
You know, when this surgery is through,

09:03.086 --> 09:05.987
I will write a love poem to this machine.

09:09.709 --> 09:11.627
Bertie, step aside. I'll do that.

09:11.628 --> 09:15.598
So he's missed the aorta,
but hit the liver square.

09:15.599 --> 09:17.299
Took a good slice out of it.

09:17.300 --> 09:19.435
He should already be dead.

09:19.436 --> 09:21.186
What is that?

09:21.187 --> 09:23.889
This, Everett, is the miraculous

09:23.890 --> 09:26.809
Edwards suction machine.

09:26.810 --> 09:28.944
I'm building a second one.

09:28.945 --> 09:31.063
For my birthday, I presume.

09:31.064 --> 09:33.014
Hmm.

09:37.537 --> 09:39.538
There you go, lad. All right.

09:39.539 --> 09:41.906
Whoa, whoa.

09:42.742 --> 09:44.493
Here we go. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:44.494 --> 09:46.045
- Where's my boy?
- Shh, shh.

09:46.046 --> 09:47.496
Where are they keeping him? The butchers.

09:47.497 --> 09:49.748
We're gonna take you to him, Mrs. Sears.

09:49.749 --> 09:52.084
- Phinny's a strong boy.
- Aye, strong.

09:52.085 --> 09:53.502
Ain't that right, Jenny?

09:53.503 --> 09:55.504
He'll be home bouncing Charlie and Ailish

09:55.505 --> 09:57.339
on his knee again in no time.

09:57.340 --> 09:58.641
Part the way.

09:58.642 --> 10:00.392
Let the boy's family through.

10:00.393 --> 10:02.960
- Let's go.
- Get your arses to the side!

10:09.903 --> 10:11.987
The family is here.

10:11.988 --> 10:16.191
We've done everything we can,
but the lung is still a problem.

10:16.192 --> 10:19.528
We'll go back and repair
that if he gets stronger.

10:19.529 --> 10:22.364
We've just got to hope he makes
it through the next few hours.

10:22.365 --> 10:24.700
I knew Phinny. He's a good man.

10:24.701 --> 10:26.535
You mean you know him.

10:26.536 --> 10:28.621
Don't go digging any graves, Missy.

10:28.622 --> 10:31.707
Of course. If there's
anything you need, just ask.

10:31.708 --> 10:33.509
You want to help us, do you?

10:33.510 --> 10:36.178
Then find the devious nigger
that done this to our boy

10:36.179 --> 10:38.380
and string him up in City Hall Park.

10:38.381 --> 10:42.134
Oh, we'll find him and
do just that, Mrs. Sears.

10:42.135 --> 10:44.436
I'm not sure that's helpful right now.

10:44.437 --> 10:47.723
We should be concentrating on the family
and praying for Phinny to get well.

10:47.724 --> 10:49.108
You know what? Cut your shit spittin'.

10:49.109 --> 10:51.894
- He's gonna make it just fine.
- Yeah.

10:51.895 --> 10:54.563
Our Phinny's got more
pluck in his little finger

10:54.564 --> 10:56.398
than all you got in all your sorry souls.

10:56.399 --> 10:58.200
To Phinny!

10:58.201 --> 11:00.152
Aye, to Phinny!

11:00.153 --> 11:02.403
That's the spirit.

11:09.879 --> 11:11.914
Bertie.

11:11.915 --> 11:14.249
I'll be back to finish the chart, Nurse.

11:14.250 --> 11:17.002
Has everyone gone completely mad today?

11:17.003 --> 11:18.671
What do you mean?

11:18.672 --> 11:21.590
First I had to push my way past an
angry mob to get into the building,

11:21.591 --> 11:24.226
and then I had to push my way
past Edwards in the theater.

11:24.227 --> 11:26.095
Ah.

11:26.096 --> 11:29.181
Well, you weren't in yet, so Thackery
needed an extra pair of hands.

11:29.182 --> 11:32.768
It's more than that. He was treating
him like some old school chum.

11:32.769 --> 11:34.653
And that contraption...

11:34.654 --> 11:37.156
It's ingenious, I know.

11:37.157 --> 11:39.491
No more nights of nursing
my sore, tired arms

11:39.492 --> 11:41.442
from all that cranking.

11:45.115 --> 11:47.616
All right.

11:47.617 --> 11:50.419
Do you remember when you were...
must have been about three or four...

11:50.420 --> 11:51.404
Excuse me.

11:51.405 --> 11:54.289
...and you got your hand
stung by a bumblebee?

11:54.290 --> 11:57.209
Do you remember? It swolled
up to the size of your head.

11:59.095 --> 12:00.679
Who the hell are you?

12:00.680 --> 12:02.347
I'm the deputy chief of surgery.

12:02.348 --> 12:05.166
Nice to meet you. I'm the Queen of England.

12:05.969 --> 12:07.686
Is he here to finish the job?

12:07.687 --> 12:11.255
Ma'am, ma'am, I assisted in this operation.

12:12.692 --> 12:15.176
What kind of hospital is this?

12:18.198 --> 12:19.732
- All right.
- Nurse Elkins.

12:19.733 --> 12:21.817
Yes, Doctor?

12:21.818 --> 12:25.237
I'd like to change the dressing
on the lower wound, please.

12:25.238 --> 12:27.573
1% acetate of aluminum.

12:27.574 --> 12:29.440
Yes, Doctor.

12:31.494 --> 12:34.163
You really got to take orders from him?

12:34.164 --> 12:37.081
I take my orders from all the doctors here.

12:38.301 --> 12:40.886
The day I let a nigger tell me what to do

12:40.887 --> 12:43.254
is the day I dig my grave.

12:46.760 --> 12:50.512
Okay. All right.

12:50.513 --> 12:52.481
All right.

12:52.482 --> 12:54.382
Officers.

12:58.354 --> 13:01.073
All right.

13:01.074 --> 13:04.359
The operation's over. They sewed him up.

13:04.360 --> 13:06.528
He's breathing, but that's about all.

13:06.529 --> 13:09.448
It'll be a while before we're
tipping pints back with him again,

13:09.449 --> 13:12.167
so you might just go on home.

13:12.168 --> 13:14.419
Could be days, lads.

13:14.420 --> 13:16.371
Show's over. Go home.

13:16.372 --> 13:18.373
We're not going anywhere!

13:21.211 --> 13:23.345
Christ, you'd think the
heat would drive 'em back.

13:23.346 --> 13:25.013
To where, the tenements?

13:27.267 --> 13:30.634
Open the door!

13:31.888 --> 13:33.972
His pain seems worse,
his fever has gone up,

13:33.973 --> 13:36.725
and his breathing has become more shallow.

13:36.726 --> 13:40.145
I know. I know.

13:40.146 --> 13:42.447
What are you doing?
You can't give him that.

13:42.448 --> 13:44.900
He needs something for
the pain. The hell I can't.

13:47.070 --> 13:50.072
- Oh, in the name of the devil!
- Hematemesis.

13:50.073 --> 13:50.983
That ain't English!

13:50.984 --> 13:53.292
Internal bleeding. Something's not holding.

13:53.293 --> 13:54.877
Should I get the theater ready?

13:54.878 --> 13:56.795
No, there's no time.
Bring me a surgical knife,

13:56.796 --> 14:00.031
carbolic, clamps, silk. Quickly.

14:13.062 --> 14:14.813
Here you are, Doctor.

14:16.766 --> 14:18.799
We...

14:20.103 --> 14:22.303
we won't be needing them.

14:23.573 --> 14:25.324
Move back, lads. Give her some air.

14:25.325 --> 14:27.659
- Off to the side. You've seen enough.
- Okay, let's go.

14:27.660 --> 14:30.112
- Off to the side.
- A little respect here, gentlemen.

14:30.113 --> 14:33.282
Okay, we're gonna take
care of that cotton-picker.

14:33.283 --> 14:35.951
Right over here. That's it, right here.

14:35.952 --> 14:38.337
Okay, it's over. It's over.

14:38.338 --> 14:41.956
Mrs. Sears, we're all
saying prayers for your boy.

14:42.959 --> 14:46.128
My boy is dead.

14:46.129 --> 14:49.715
He's dead at the hand of
one of them black bastards.

14:49.716 --> 14:53.685
Take down every one of
them fucking darkies.

14:53.686 --> 14:55.604
Rip their throats

14:55.605 --> 14:57.389
and grind their eyes down to jelly.

14:57.390 --> 14:59.283
Make 'em pay for what
they done to my Phinny!

14:59.310 --> 14:59.942
Over there!

14:59.943 --> 15:02.644
- Get 'em!
- Make 'em pay! Make 'em pay!

15:02.645 --> 15:05.731
- Get the darkie!
- Kill that nigger!

15:08.318 --> 15:10.152
Thack.

15:10.153 --> 15:11.820
Thack!

15:11.821 --> 15:14.688
What are you doing? Help him!

15:19.629 --> 15:23.030
Stop it. Stop it. Leave him. Leave him!

15:25.468 --> 15:29.370
You're just standing there.
Help him, God damn it.

15:32.091 --> 15:34.977
Tell the nurses to lock
all the windows and doors.

15:34.978 --> 15:36.428
What happened?

15:36.429 --> 15:38.796
We need to get this man to the clinic.

15:40.016 --> 15:42.433
You need to stay out of sight.

16:04.457 --> 16:06.541
Harry, I got one for you.

16:06.542 --> 16:08.427
Been slashed to ribbons.

16:08.428 --> 16:11.912
Get me silk, two clamps,
and a Steinhart's needle.

16:15.351 --> 16:17.769
Can't see. Can you see anything?

16:17.770 --> 16:19.253
No.

16:22.225 --> 16:24.643
- Oh, watch yourself!
- Shit!

16:48.584 --> 16:50.635
No, stop.

16:50.636 --> 16:52.721
- You can't be in here.
- We need help.

16:52.722 --> 16:54.389
No, no, no. You need to get out.

16:54.390 --> 16:56.308
- Hey, get them out of here.
- Back up.

16:56.309 --> 16:57.843
- No niggers allowed.
- You can't be here.

16:57.844 --> 17:00.562
I said get out of here! No niggers allowed!

17:00.563 --> 17:03.130
- Hey, hey!
- Hey, get off!

17:05.151 --> 17:07.269
Edwards!

17:09.771 --> 17:11.972
My apologies.

17:13.608 --> 17:15.359
We're gonna have to separate the room.

17:15.361 --> 17:18.780
Let's get all the Negro
patients over to this side.

17:18.781 --> 17:20.866
You're letting them stay?

17:20.867 --> 17:23.785
- Thack, this isn't a Negro...
- Not the time, Everett.

17:23.786 --> 17:25.704
You got something to say to his killer?

17:25.704 --> 17:27.079
I got something to say.

17:27.080 --> 17:27.911
Excuse me.

17:27.936 --> 17:29.624
What I got to say you
can't print in your paper.

17:29.625 --> 17:32.010
- Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry, ma'am.
- But I'll say it anyway.

17:32.011 --> 17:33.261
- Excuse me.
- What is it, lad?

17:33.262 --> 17:35.913
Them fucking darkies are...

17:40.353 --> 17:43.138
- Help me up, lad. Help me up.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:43.139 --> 17:44.639
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:44.640 --> 17:47.109
The one who killed our
Phinny is in the hospital.

17:47.110 --> 17:49.194
Wait, what are you saying?

17:49.195 --> 17:52.697
Them kids saw with their own
eyes. He snuck in the back.

17:52.698 --> 17:55.899
And they're treating that
murdering Quashee right now.

17:58.287 --> 17:59.654
Get the rope.

18:01.457 --> 18:04.493
The cotton-picker that
got Phinny's inside.

18:04.494 --> 18:06.461
Shit, they got ropes.

18:06.462 --> 18:07.796
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:07.797 --> 18:09.664
They get in, hit 'em with this.

18:09.665 --> 18:11.699
All right.

18:14.720 --> 18:17.339
I can't get away. I'm having
a bit of a situation here,

18:17.340 --> 18:20.092
but nothing to worry yourself
about, dear. All is well.

18:20.093 --> 18:21.908
It's fucking mayhem
out there. They're gonna

18:21.934 --> 18:23.562
have the doors open in about 10 seconds.

18:23.563 --> 18:26.481
I just wouldn't come
south of 50th Street today.

18:26.482 --> 18:28.016
All right?

18:28.017 --> 18:30.819
I love you, too.

18:30.820 --> 18:34.189
Maybe the police should break up the crowd.

18:34.190 --> 18:36.441
The coppers are the ones
fucking spurring them on.

18:36.442 --> 18:38.776
God damn it!

18:39.946 --> 18:42.896
Heave! Heave!

18:51.124 --> 18:52.990
Shit.

19:13.946 --> 19:16.314
The mob is in the building.

19:16.315 --> 19:18.982
They are destroying this hospital.

19:22.905 --> 19:24.990
Okay, listen, everybody.

19:24.991 --> 19:26.655
We need to get the Negro
patients out of here.

19:26.682 --> 19:27.576
You, help me.

19:27.577 --> 19:30.745
Okay? Patch up the wounds as best you can.

19:30.746 --> 19:33.165
We're gonna have to
treat them someplace else.

19:33.166 --> 19:36.168
Let's take the south
stairs through the basement.

19:36.169 --> 19:38.753
Let's go. Quickly.

19:38.754 --> 19:40.589
There's a bunch of darkies in here!

19:50.733 --> 19:52.850
Hey!

20:04.447 --> 20:06.447
Come on!

20:07.917 --> 20:11.169
Those are our fucking horses!

20:11.170 --> 20:13.620
Whose side are you on?

20:14.373 --> 20:15.840
This isn't a good idea.

20:15.841 --> 20:17.908
Drastic times.

20:19.345 --> 20:22.079
Where the hell are we going?

20:25.885 --> 20:29.303
What in God's name is this?

20:30.306 --> 20:32.190
Is this an operating room?

20:32.191 --> 20:34.476
An exam room, lavatory,
a postoperative ward,

20:34.477 --> 20:36.111
and whatever else I need it to be.

20:36.112 --> 20:37.862
You did this?

20:37.863 --> 20:41.032
- You can't do this.
- I think he did.

20:41.033 --> 20:42.850
And you knew?

20:42.851 --> 20:44.869
How else could I have
helped him as much as I did?

20:46.437 --> 20:48.258
It's only a matter of time
till they find us here.

20:48.259 --> 20:49.741
Why? I never found it.

20:49.742 --> 20:51.692
They're obviously looking
harder than you did.

20:52.878 --> 20:54.296
Aren't you a laundress?

20:54.297 --> 20:56.581
Down here I am a surgical nurse.

20:56.582 --> 20:58.466
Oh, God help me.

20:58.467 --> 21:01.386
And did you steal all this equipment?

21:01.387 --> 21:03.672
Most of it I bought.

21:03.673 --> 21:06.091
Other items I rescued and repaired.

21:06.092 --> 21:08.260
But not the obstetric equipment.

21:08.261 --> 21:10.562
I stole that.

21:10.563 --> 21:12.564
You delivered babies down here?

21:12.565 --> 21:14.232
- Two.
- Algie.

21:16.902 --> 21:20.605
I want every Negro out of
this building right now.

21:20.606 --> 21:23.608
Mr. Barrow is right, but not
for the reasons he believes.

21:23.609 --> 21:26.328
Everyone here who can walk on their own

21:26.329 --> 21:27.862
will have to find shelter elsewhere.

21:27.863 --> 21:29.664
But no one is safe out on the street.

21:29.665 --> 21:31.449
- Especially them.
- I'll take them.

21:31.450 --> 21:33.618
Our Lady of Sorrows has a friary

21:33.619 --> 21:36.288
a few blocks down where they'll be safe.

21:36.289 --> 21:38.075
Even hooligans won't riot in a church.

21:38.076 --> 21:39.624
They may leave, but I will not allow you...

21:39.625 --> 21:42.043
- Are you volunteering, then?
- No.

21:42.044 --> 21:44.596
Then I'll thank you not to interfere.

21:44.597 --> 21:46.715
I'll have one of the
other sisters come with me.

21:46.716 --> 21:49.249
Thanks, Harry. Everett,
would you go with them?

21:49.935 --> 21:51.585
Yes, Thack.

21:53.973 --> 21:56.808
Your recoveries, can
they get on their feet?

21:56.809 --> 21:59.561
Certainly not well enough to run
through the streets in a riot.

21:59.562 --> 22:02.113
Then we'll have to
transfer them by ambulance

22:02.114 --> 22:03.315
to another facility.

22:03.316 --> 22:05.233
Any ideas for a destination?

22:05.234 --> 22:07.736
The closest hospitals are
Presbyterian and Bellevue.

22:07.737 --> 22:09.070
Too far.

22:09.071 --> 22:10.739
The Jewish hospital will take them,

22:10.740 --> 22:13.575
but that would mean crossing through
two Irish and one Italian ghetto.

22:13.576 --> 22:15.994
They belong in a Negro infirmary.

22:15.995 --> 22:19.246
There's one in Little Africa on Minetta.

22:20.716 --> 22:24.002
How do we get outside without
being killed by that mob up there?

22:24.003 --> 22:26.787
Take the back stairs to the ambulance bay.

22:32.345 --> 22:34.062
Where are the horses?

22:34.063 --> 22:36.597
Ask the fuckers who stole 'em.

22:38.484 --> 22:39.934
What do we do now?

22:39.935 --> 22:42.153
- We take them ourselves.
- On foot?

22:42.154 --> 22:46.358
Bertie, I need a surgeon to stay
here on call until we've returned.

22:46.359 --> 22:48.443
- Can you brave it?
- Of course.

22:48.444 --> 22:51.780
Dr. Edwards, you can't be
seen out there in plain sight.

22:51.781 --> 22:54.449
I know, but I'm not leaving my patients.

22:54.450 --> 22:57.285
We won't have enough of us
to transfer all the patients.

22:57.286 --> 23:01.038
Load the gurneys. I'll take the rest.

23:02.625 --> 23:04.042
How?

23:24.397 --> 23:25.814
How are you doing, Mr. Cleland?

23:25.815 --> 23:27.816
The bumps make it hurt.

23:27.817 --> 23:31.234
Hypodermic. Squibb's liquor of opium.

23:32.988 --> 23:34.489
Arm or abdomen?

23:34.490 --> 23:36.241
Arm is fine.

23:36.242 --> 23:38.410
You want me to stop moving?

23:38.411 --> 23:40.861
Not unless you need to.

23:45.084 --> 23:47.335
Everyone stay under your wraps.

23:51.307 --> 23:53.725
And where are you all going?

23:53.726 --> 23:55.727
We're heading downtown.

23:55.728 --> 23:58.229
I meant more specific-like.

23:58.230 --> 23:59.731
What you got under there?

23:59.732 --> 24:02.767
Just let us pass and you
won't have any trouble.

24:02.768 --> 24:05.320
You'll have trouble if I say you do.

24:05.321 --> 24:07.122
We're headed to the city morgue.

24:07.123 --> 24:09.591
- What for?
- Leprosy outbreak.

24:09.592 --> 24:11.793
Can't keep them at the
Knick. Need to burn the bodies

24:11.794 --> 24:13.795
down there before anyone else gets it.

24:13.796 --> 24:15.396
You can look, but about a week from now,

24:15.397 --> 24:17.132
you're gonna be down on
your knees trying to find

24:17.133 --> 24:19.433
where your testicles rolled off to.

24:30.212 --> 24:32.881
Away! Back away, I tell you!

24:32.882 --> 24:34.349
You'll all be damned to hell

24:34.350 --> 24:36.434
if you touch one hair
on these people's heads!

24:36.435 --> 24:38.052
Keep walking.

24:38.053 --> 24:39.471
You'll all face the fires of hell

24:39.472 --> 24:42.223
if I have anything to say
about it. And you know I do.

24:42.224 --> 24:44.726
One of them could be the
fella that killed Phinny Sears!

24:44.727 --> 24:47.761
Hump off! You didn't even know the man.

24:58.407 --> 25:00.909
I think they've finally given up.

25:00.910 --> 25:03.411
I suppose they have.

25:03.412 --> 25:06.748
Probably off to go destroy
someone else's place.

25:06.749 --> 25:08.249
Wherever that may be.

25:08.250 --> 25:10.917
As long as it isn't
here, I don't give a damn.

25:11.837 --> 25:14.088
Let's finish cleaning up this glass.

25:14.089 --> 25:17.308
And we need inventories on
all medicines and equipment.

25:17.309 --> 25:19.010
And patients.

25:19.011 --> 25:21.294
I want all patients accounted for.

25:22.765 --> 25:24.649
Don't put any weight on it.

25:24.650 --> 25:27.318
Just go home and get some rest.

25:27.319 --> 25:30.154
Fuck home. I'm going uptown.

25:30.155 --> 25:32.273
They got all the whores
turned out in the street.

25:32.274 --> 25:34.409
Fellas are running trains on them.

25:34.410 --> 25:37.060
Cops are too busy to do anything about it.

25:43.786 --> 25:48.121
Nobody leaves until this
place is back the way it was.

26:30.833 --> 26:32.300
Who's in charge here?

26:32.301 --> 26:34.701
Dr. Williams. Over there.

26:39.758 --> 26:41.843
Dr. Williams?

26:41.844 --> 26:45.013
I'm Dr. John Thackery, Chief
of Surgery over at the Knick.

26:45.014 --> 26:47.849
This is my assistant
chief, Dr. Algernon Edwards.

26:47.850 --> 26:50.101
- Algie.
- Moses Williams.

26:50.102 --> 26:52.520
- You know each other?
- We were at Harvard together.

26:52.521 --> 26:55.907
Moses was the one in his year
and I was the one in mine.

26:55.908 --> 26:58.359
- I'd shake hands, but...
- Of course.

26:58.360 --> 27:01.245
We know you're overrun here,
but we brought you seven more.

27:01.246 --> 27:03.364
It was too dangerous to
keep them at the Knick.

27:03.365 --> 27:06.034
We'll help out in any way we can.

27:06.035 --> 27:08.870
Then pick a patient, get started.

27:08.871 --> 27:11.456
You're welcome to any of our supplies.

27:11.457 --> 27:14.208
Thank you. We're out of
just about everything.

27:14.209 --> 27:16.377
Thread, carbolic, clean bandages,

27:16.378 --> 27:18.495
alum, cocaine.

27:19.682 --> 27:21.882
We'll make do.

27:26.221 --> 27:29.223
You see anything that way?

27:40.986 --> 27:43.287
Keep moving, buddy. It's closed.

27:43.288 --> 27:45.073
But, Officer, I'm family.

27:45.074 --> 27:47.158
Of a worker in a whore shop?

27:47.159 --> 27:49.711
For the love of Christ,
the whole town's going crazy

27:49.712 --> 27:51.412
and you want to get
your fucking log dunked?

27:51.413 --> 27:54.215
No one's going in the establishment
till this fracas is over.

27:54.216 --> 27:57.635
I understand, but this is urgent.

27:57.636 --> 28:00.088
Do I look like one of these hooligans

28:00.089 --> 28:01.673
tearing the streets apart?

28:01.674 --> 28:04.308
I don't give a good goddamn
if you're the second coming.

28:04.309 --> 28:06.477
You're not going in. Now
take it on the arches.

28:06.478 --> 28:08.680
- Excuse me.
- Go on, get! Get!

28:08.681 --> 28:11.598
- All right! God damn it!
- Get out!

28:26.031 --> 28:28.082
Junia.

28:28.083 --> 28:30.001
I just wanted to make sure you were...

28:31.954 --> 28:35.757
I'm fine, Hermie, but you need to go.

28:35.758 --> 28:39.177
I'm nearly done if you're next.

28:55.978 --> 28:58.511
You can put it down.

29:05.904 --> 29:07.739
You need a break?

29:07.740 --> 29:10.825
I can have someone else
step in to help me finish.

29:10.826 --> 29:12.493
No, I'm fine.

29:12.494 --> 29:14.744
And there are so many more.

29:15.798 --> 29:17.831
Towel.

29:20.719 --> 29:22.752
For you.

29:26.892 --> 29:28.760
Jamison.

29:28.761 --> 29:31.562
- Who is Jamison?
- That's me. I am.

29:38.520 --> 29:39.937
What do we have?

29:39.938 --> 29:42.555
Gashed upper thigh and buttocks.

29:45.160 --> 29:47.560
Dr. Williams, have a look at this.

29:50.199 --> 29:51.616
He's cut through to the bone.

29:51.617 --> 29:53.451
We'll have to sew it up in layers.

29:53.452 --> 29:55.503
We have no more anesthetic.

29:55.504 --> 29:57.955
No morphine, no cocaine.

29:57.956 --> 29:59.540
We'll just have to hold him down.

29:59.541 --> 30:02.909
- He's gonna thrash.
- We will make do.

30:06.715 --> 30:08.748
Edwards.

30:15.607 --> 30:18.226
You don't have to stay with me
if this is too offensive for you.

30:18.227 --> 30:19.977
I've seen a buttock before.

30:19.978 --> 30:21.612
- A black one?
- Yes, yours.

30:21.613 --> 30:23.648
When we'd play in the
garden with the water pails

30:23.649 --> 30:25.566
and you'd run around without pants.

30:25.567 --> 30:27.902
- We were three.
- And he saw mine.

30:27.903 --> 30:30.186
For God's sake, Neely.

30:46.255 --> 30:48.788
Suction.

30:53.979 --> 30:56.212
That's enough.

30:57.349 --> 30:59.734
What's next?

30:59.735 --> 31:02.486
"Pass the needles through
the intestinal wall

31:02.487 --> 31:05.940
one-half inch below
and, drawing the threads,

31:05.941 --> 31:08.109
invaginate the end of the upper portion

31:08.110 --> 31:10.278
into the lower through the slit."

31:10.279 --> 31:12.280
Okay, but this is intraperitoneal.

31:12.281 --> 31:14.448
So what do I do then?

31:14.449 --> 31:16.534
I don't know.

31:16.535 --> 31:19.035
Okay, well, show me the photograph.

31:21.290 --> 31:23.373
So I can see it.

31:27.462 --> 31:29.579
Got it.

31:41.276 --> 31:43.226
Sorry.

31:45.314 --> 31:46.864
Who's next?

31:46.865 --> 31:49.065
This is the last patient.

31:52.988 --> 31:56.322
Then it looks as though
our work here is done.

31:57.826 --> 32:00.995
It would be nice to catch
up in quieter circumstances.

32:00.996 --> 32:02.880
Find out how you landed at the Knick

32:02.881 --> 32:04.532
with the great John Thackery.

32:04.533 --> 32:06.300
I'd like that.

32:06.301 --> 32:08.368
Take care, Moses.

32:10.505 --> 32:12.705
Thank you.

32:14.176 --> 32:16.644
The rain seems to have calmed things a bit.

32:16.645 --> 32:18.229
It may seem quiet,

32:18.230 --> 32:20.848
but we have no idea how
safe the streets are.

32:20.849 --> 32:23.017
Well, we can load the
gurneys in the ambulance,

32:23.018 --> 32:24.986
but I ain't got the strength
to pull 'em back alone.

32:24.987 --> 32:26.854
So you got to keep pushing.

32:26.855 --> 32:29.357
- I'll help you.
- I'll come, too.

32:29.358 --> 32:31.776
I want to check on the condition of things.

32:31.777 --> 32:34.612
I'm sure my office is a shambles.

32:34.613 --> 32:37.081
Then I'll see Nurse Elkins gets home safely

32:37.082 --> 32:39.250
and I'll meet you there.

32:39.251 --> 32:41.484
What about my bike?

32:42.921 --> 32:45.439
Well, if it hasn't already
become a victim of the riot,

32:45.440 --> 32:47.258
it certainly won't at this point.

32:47.259 --> 32:49.576
You can get it in the morning.

32:55.050 --> 32:57.000
All right.

33:55.610 --> 33:57.810
Unbelievable.

34:11.626 --> 34:14.210
I thought for certain all
this would be destroyed.

34:14.212 --> 34:16.496
They didn't even come down here.

34:17.549 --> 34:19.350
I guess I pushed you across town

34:19.351 --> 34:21.601
under a gurney for nothing.

34:21.603 --> 34:23.137
Not for nothing.

34:26.775 --> 34:28.558
What sex?

34:29.643 --> 34:31.277
What?

34:31.279 --> 34:33.864
The babies you delivered.

34:33.864 --> 34:35.898
Oh.

34:36.618 --> 34:39.351
Um, two girls.

34:42.373 --> 34:45.826
You've become someone I didn't expect.

34:45.827 --> 34:49.246
What, a sneak with a scalpel,

34:49.246 --> 34:51.415
plying his trade in dark corners?

34:51.416 --> 34:54.534
No, though that was a surprise.

34:57.172 --> 34:59.455
Then what have I become?

35:01.093 --> 35:03.876
You did something remarkable here.

35:05.430 --> 35:09.015
And to watch you today...

35:12.354 --> 35:16.639
I suppose I still thought of you
as that little boy I grew up with.

35:19.327 --> 35:20.828
The one without the pants?

35:20.829 --> 35:24.030
The very same one.

35:28.587 --> 35:31.338
I was terrified for you today.

35:31.339 --> 35:34.458
The whole city wanting to hurt you.

35:34.459 --> 35:37.845
And with only you to protect me.

35:37.846 --> 35:39.912
I would have.

35:40.849 --> 35:42.915
I have no doubt.

36:19.754 --> 36:23.491
I doubt I'm allowed much further.

36:23.492 --> 36:24.925
It's all right.

36:24.926 --> 36:26.560
I'm sure the housemother is still asleep

36:26.561 --> 36:28.761
and she's practically deaf.

36:39.107 --> 36:41.742
I guess it was a good thing
things were happening so fast,

36:41.743 --> 36:43.444
'cause I didn't have any time to think.

36:43.445 --> 36:45.696
Well, you did brilliantly.

36:45.697 --> 36:48.115
Okay, good night, Nurse Elkins.

36:48.116 --> 36:50.584
Really well done today.

36:50.585 --> 36:53.369
My roommate's already gone to work.

36:54.206 --> 36:56.957
You can come in if you'd like.

37:51.763 --> 37:54.430
I need help taking this off.

38:09.581 --> 38:11.731
Will it hurt?

38:18.423 --> 38:21.759
I can make it painless

38:21.760 --> 38:23.876
and perfect.

40:17.959 --> 40:19.992
Hi.

40:22.464 --> 40:24.214
What?

40:24.215 --> 40:26.967
What?

40:26.968 --> 40:29.502
What?

40:30.005 --> 40:38.403
