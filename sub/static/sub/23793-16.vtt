>> John: WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:33.433 --> 00:34.667
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:34.734 --> 00:36.233
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:36.300 --> 00:37.200
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:37.266 --> 00:38.333
US.

00:38.400 --> 00:39.200
JUST TIME FOR A QUICK RECAP OF

00:39.266 --> 00:40.333
THE WEEK.

00:40.400 --> 00:41.433
AND WE BEGIN WITH

00:41.500 --> 00:42.467
PRESIDENT TRUMP, THE ABUSIVE

00:42.533 --> 00:43.400
FATHER AMERICA WILL BE TALKING

00:43.467 --> 00:44.600
ABOUT IN THERAPY FOR THE NEXT

00:44.667 --> 00:46.667
40 YEARS.

00:46.734 --> 00:47.967
THIS WEEK SAW CONTINUED OUTRAGE

00:48.033 --> 00:49.667
OVER HIS ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICY

00:49.734 --> 00:51.567
CAUSING CHILDREN TO BE SEPARATED

00:51.633 --> 00:52.900
FROM THEIR PARENTS AT THE

00:52.967 --> 00:54.200
BORDER, A POLICY WHICH, YOU MAY

00:54.266 --> 00:55.667
REMEMBER, TRUMP REPEATEDLY

00:55.734 --> 00:56.867
INSISTED LAST WEEK HE HAD NO

00:56.934 --> 00:57.934
POWER TO CHANGE.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.300
HIS HANDS WERE TIED.

00:59.367 --> 01:00.900
THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO.

01:00.967 --> 01:03.467
WELL, GUESS WHAT?

01:03.533 --> 01:04.934
>> IN A RARE POLITICAL RETREAT,

01:05.000 --> 01:06.500
PRESIDENT TRUMP TODAY ORDERED AN

01:06.567 --> 01:08.166
END TO THE POLICY OF SEPARATING

01:08.233 --> 01:09.633
MIGRANT FAMILIES WHO ENTER THE

01:09.700 --> 01:11.800
COUNTRY ILLEGALLY.

01:11.867 --> 01:13.000
>> John: YES, TRUMP CLAIMED HE

01:13.066 --> 01:14.033
COULDN'T DO A THING AND THEN HE

01:14.100 --> 01:15.367
DID IT.

01:15.433 --> 01:17.667
WHICH IS A LITTLE STRANGE,

01:17.734 --> 01:18.967
'CAUSE HE USUALLY CLAIMS HE CAN

01:19.033 --> 01:20.066
DO THINGS AND THEN DOESN'T DO

01:20.133 --> 01:21.100
THEM, LIKE DRAINING THE SWAMP OR

01:21.166 --> 01:22.633
LOCKING UP HILLARY OR ATTENDING

01:22.700 --> 01:24.700
TIFFANY'S SWEET SIXTEEN.

01:24.767 --> 01:26.233
IT'S BEEN EIGHT YEARS, TIFF.

01:26.300 --> 01:30.967
TIME TO LEAVE THE RADISSON.

01:31.033 --> 01:32.100
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT EXECUTIVE

01:32.166 --> 01:33.066
ORDER HAS SOME SIGNIFICANT

01:33.133 --> 01:34.066
HITCHES, 'CAUSE WHILE FAMILIES

01:34.133 --> 01:35.100
WILL NOW NOT BE SEPARATED,

01:35.166 --> 01:37.033
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'LL BE

01:37.100 --> 01:37.600
DETAINED TOGETHER.

01:37.667 --> 01:38.800
AND UNDER CURRENT RULES, THE

01:38.867 --> 01:39.767
CHILDREN CAN'T BE HELD IN

01:39.834 --> 01:40.934
DETENTION FACILITIES FOR MORE

01:41.033 --> 01:42.000
THAN 20 DAYS, WHICH MEANS LESS

01:42.066 --> 01:43.367
THAN THREE WEEKS FROM NOW, THEY

01:43.433 --> 01:44.367
COULD START SPLITTING FAMILIES

01:44.433 --> 01:48.166
UP ALL OVER AGAIN.

01:48.233 --> 01:49.467
AND REMEMBER, 2,000 CHILDREN

01:49.533 --> 01:50.967
HAVE ALREADY BEEN SEPARATED FROM

01:51.033 --> 01:51.333
THEIR PARENTS.

01:51.400 --> 01:52.400
WHAT EXACTLY IS THE PLAN TO DEAL

01:52.467 --> 01:53.600
WITH THEM?

01:53.667 --> 01:54.900
>> NOW THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

01:54.967 --> 01:56.800
HAS RELEASED A GENERAL PLAN FOR

01:56.867 --> 01:57.367
BRINGING SEPARATED FAMILIES

01:57.433 --> 01:58.367
TOGETHER.

01:58.433 --> 01:59.200
BUT MAJOR PIECES ARE STILL

01:59.266 --> 02:00.333
MISSING, INCLUDING A CLEAR

02:00.400 --> 02:01.667
TIMELINE ON JUST HOW LONG IT

02:01.734 --> 02:03.333
WOULD TAKE AND HOW IT WOULD GET

02:03.400 --> 02:05.934
DONE.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.533
>> John: WELL, HOLD ON, 'CAUSE

02:07.600 --> 02:08.667
THOSE ARE SOME PRETTY MAJOR

02:08.734 --> 02:10.500
PIECES TO LEAVE OUT.

02:10.567 --> 02:13.633
IN FACT, IT'S ALL THE PIECES.

02:13.700 --> 02:14.867
"HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE" AND "HOW

02:14.934 --> 02:16.266
IT WILL GET DONE" ARE THE WHOLE

02:16.333 --> 02:17.633
PLAN.

02:17.700 --> 02:19.300
THAT'S LIKE A RECIPE FOR CAKE

02:19.367 --> 02:20.333
THAT JUST SAYS "YOU'RE GOING TO

02:20.400 --> 02:22.834
HAVE SOME CAKE."

02:22.900 --> 02:23.767
HOW WAS THIS PASSED DOWN FROM

02:23.834 --> 02:25.367
YOUR GRANDMOTHER?

02:25.433 --> 02:27.033
I THINK THIS IS NOTHING.

02:27.100 --> 02:28.233
BUT AS THE WEEK WENT ON, PERHAPS

02:28.300 --> 02:29.367
THE MOST NOTABLE THING WAS THE

02:29.433 --> 02:32.266
LENGTHS THAT SOME TRUMP

02:32.333 --> 02:34.567
SUPPORTERS WENT TO DEFEND THE

02:34.633 --> 02:35.567
INDEFENSIBLE, FROM "THEIR

02:35.633 --> 02:36.433
PARENTS SHOULDN'T HAVE BROKEN

02:36.500 --> 02:37.300
THE LAW" TO "THE CONDITIONS

02:37.367 --> 02:38.600
AREN'T THAT BAD."

02:38.667 --> 02:40.467
BUT IT TOOK FOX'S STUART VARNEY

02:40.533 --> 02:41.166
TO GO WITH THE BOLD ARGUMENT OF

02:41.233 --> 02:42.700
"WHO GIVES A SHIT?"

02:42.767 --> 02:44.033
>> IF YOU READ THE HEADLINES OR

02:44.100 --> 02:45.367
YOU WATCH THE EVENING NEWS TODAY

02:45.433 --> 02:47.100
OR YESTERDAY OR THIS WEEK AT

02:47.166 --> 02:48.467
ALL, IT'S TRADE WAR, IT'S

02:48.533 --> 02:51.467
CHILDREN IN CAGES.

02:51.533 --> 02:53.066
THE REAL BIG STORY THAT AFFECTS

02:53.133 --> 02:55.200
EVERYBODY IN AMERICA IS THE

02:55.266 --> 02:56.533
SUCCESS OF THE PRESIDENT'S

02:56.600 --> 02:58.000
TAX CUT PACKAGE AND WHAT IT'S

02:58.066 --> 03:00.934
DONE FOR OUR ECONOMY.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.033
>> John: "WHY ARE WE TALKING

03:02.100 --> 03:03.100
ABOUT THIS?

03:03.166 --> 03:04.100
WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT

03:04.166 --> 03:05.133
SOMETHING ELSE."

03:05.200 --> 03:13.333
THAT DEFLECTION TECHNIQUE

03:13.400 --> 03:14.100
DOESN'T REALLY WORK WHEN THE

03:14.166 --> 03:16.033
THING YOU'RE DEFLECTING FROM IS

03:16.100 --> 03:16.767
CHILDREN IN CAGES.

03:16.834 --> 03:17.934
IF A REALTOR SELLING A HOUSE

03:18.000 --> 03:18.734
WERE TO SAY, "WHY ARE WE TALKING

03:18.800 --> 03:19.567
ABOUT THE CHILDREN IN CAGES?

03:19.633 --> 03:20.934
THE KITCHEN HAS MARBLE

03:21.033 --> 03:21.433
COUNTERTOPS," THE ONLY

03:21.500 --> 03:22.433
ACCEPTABLE RESPONSE WOULD BE,

03:22.500 --> 03:23.734
"BECAUSE THEY'RE CHILDREN, AND

03:23.800 --> 03:24.467
THEY'RE IN CAGES.

03:24.533 --> 03:25.233
SOMEONE NEEDS TO LET THEM OUT,

03:25.300 --> 03:30.800
YOU FUCKING MONSTER."

03:30.867 --> 03:32.667
BUT FOR EVERYBODY'S SANITY,

03:32.734 --> 03:34.266
LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING

03:34.333 --> 03:34.700
THAT'S NOT THE TRUMP

03:34.767 --> 03:35.533
ADMINISTRATION.

03:35.600 --> 03:36.500
LET'S TALK ABOUT NORWAY.

03:36.567 --> 03:37.467
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THESE.

03:37.533 --> 03:39.066
NORWAY IS ACTUALLY HOME TO OVER

03:39.133 --> 03:40.266
100 7-ELEVEN LOCATIONS, AND

03:40.333 --> 03:41.600
RECENTLY, THIS CHAIN GOT ITSELF

03:41.667 --> 03:43.033
INTO A BIT OF TROUBLE OVER AN AD

03:43.100 --> 03:43.767
THAT IT AIMED AT FOREIGN

03:43.834 --> 03:45.467
TOURISTS.

03:45.533 --> 03:46.300
AND BEFORE YOU WATCH THIS, JUST

03:46.367 --> 03:47.066
KNOW, THIS AD IS REAL, AND THERE

03:47.133 --> 03:48.166
IS A TWIST IN THE MIDDLE.

04:16.133 --> 04:18.700
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

04:18.767 --> 04:20.734
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY, 7-ELEVEN, YOU

04:20.800 --> 04:22.200
CAN'T JUST CALL NORWAY THE

04:22.266 --> 04:26.467
"LAND OF CHLAMYDIA."

04:26.533 --> 04:27.967
BECAUSE THAT'S OPENING YOURSELF

04:28.033 --> 04:29.767
UP TO A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT

04:29.834 --> 04:30.567
FROM LAS VEGAS, TAMPA, AND THE

04:30.633 --> 04:33.233
WAVE POOL AT EVERY WATER PARK.

04:33.300 --> 04:33.967
AND, LOOK, IT WASN'T JUST VIDEO

04:34.033 --> 04:34.734
ADS.

04:34.800 --> 04:35.433
7-ELEVEN EVEN PUT POSTERS IN

04:35.500 --> 04:37.367
TRAIN STATIONS, AND I THINK I'M

04:37.433 --> 04:38.600
IN A POSITION TO SAY, THAT IS

04:38.667 --> 04:39.734
THE SECOND-MOST SHAMELESS

04:39.800 --> 04:41.000
SIGNAGE-BASED CHLAMYDIA

04:41.066 --> 04:42.300
PUBLICITY STUNT THAT I'VE EVER

04:42.367 --> 04:43.900
SEEN.

04:43.967 --> 04:44.767
AND, LOOK, THE NORWEGIANS WHO

04:44.834 --> 04:46.033
SAW THOSE POSTERS WERE

04:46.100 --> 04:49.934
UNDERSTANDABLY CONFUSED.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.100
>> WHAT?

04:51.166 --> 04:52.500
I'M SPEECHLESS.

04:52.567 --> 04:53.700
>> NOT A VERY GOOD AD FOR

04:53.767 --> 04:55.867
NORWAY.

04:55.934 --> 04:57.000
>> IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT WE HAVE

04:57.066 --> 04:58.233
TO HAVE THIS KIND OF THING FOR

04:58.300 --> 05:03.967
OUR TOURISTS.

05:04.033 --> 05:04.567
>> IS THIS THE REASON PEOPLE

05:04.633 --> 05:05.400
COME TO NORWAY?

05:05.467 --> 05:06.266
SLEEPING AROUND?

05:06.333 --> 05:07.233
ISN'T IT PLACES LIKE THAILAND

05:07.300 --> 05:10.233
YOU GO TO FOR THAT?

05:10.300 --> 05:11.133
>> John: OKAY, THAT IS A PRETTY

05:11.200 --> 05:15.500
LAZY STEREOTYPE OF THAILAND.

05:15.567 --> 05:17.333
WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THERE ARE

05:17.400 --> 05:17.867
NOT SEXUAL ASPECTS OF THAI

05:17.934 --> 05:18.100
CULTURE.

05:18.166 --> 05:19.600
FOR EXAMPLE, DID YOU KNOW THAT

05:19.667 --> 05:20.200
THAI ICED TEA IS JUST REGULAR

05:20.266 --> 05:20.834
ICED TEA WITH FOUR FLUID OUNCES

05:20.900 --> 05:21.333
OF JIZZ POURED INTO IT?

05:21.400 --> 05:22.166
IT'S TRUE, IT'S TRUE.

05:22.233 --> 05:23.367
I MEAN, TO BE HONEST, I DON'T

05:23.433 --> 05:27.100
KNOW IF IT'S ALWAYS TRUE, BUT

05:27.166 --> 05:27.700
IT IS ALWAYS TRUE WHEN I MAKE

05:27.767 --> 05:28.567
IT.

05:28.633 --> 05:29.500
MMM, THAT IS REFRESHINGLY

05:29.567 --> 05:32.033
VISCOUS.

05:32.100 --> 05:33.600
BUT THE THING IS, NORWAY DOES

05:33.667 --> 05:35.367
HAVE ONE OF THE HIGHEST REPORTED

05:35.433 --> 05:38.133
CHLAMYDIA RATES IN EUROPE, AND

05:38.200 --> 05:39.333
7-ELEVEN'S ARE BY NO MEANS THE

05:39.400 --> 05:42.100
MOST EXPLICIT ADS PROMOTING

05:42.166 --> 05:43.433
SEXUAL HEALTH THERE.

05:43.500 --> 05:44.000
THE NORWEGIAN DIRECTORATE OF

05:44.066 --> 05:44.700
HEALTH PRODUCED THESE POSTERS

05:44.767 --> 05:45.834
THAT TRANSLATE TO

05:45.900 --> 05:47.367
"USE A CONDOM ON YOUR DICK" AND

05:47.433 --> 05:49.033
"USE A CONDOM IN YOUR PUSSY."

05:49.100 --> 05:50.166
WHICH IS BOLD, BUT ALSO MAKES IT

05:50.233 --> 05:52.233
SOUND LIKE NORWEGIANS HAD

05:52.300 --> 05:53.900
CONDOMS BUT WERE JUST USING THEM

05:53.967 --> 05:55.867
WRONG, LIKE FOR KEEPING THEIR

05:55.934 --> 05:57.200
JELLY BEANS FRESH AND

05:57.266 --> 06:01.133
WATER-PROOFING THEIR DOGS' PAWS.

06:01.200 --> 06:02.700
BUT MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE

06:02.767 --> 06:03.900
STD-THEMED NORWEGIAN AD CAMPAIGN

06:03.967 --> 06:05.300
CAME FROM THE SEXUAL HEALTH

06:05.367 --> 06:07.166
CHARITY RFSU, WHICH JUST A FEW

06:07.233 --> 06:07.900
YEARS AGO PROMOTED SAFE SEX IN

06:08.000 --> 06:16.633
THE GREATEST POSSIBLE WAY.

06:16.700 --> 06:21.000
>>

06:29.400 --> 06:39.667
>> John: OKAY, OKAY, I ONLY HAVE

06:39.734 --> 06:40.900
FAVORITE PARTS OF THAT.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.500
FIRST, OBVIOUSLY, THE SCREAMING.

06:42.567 --> 06:43.500
WHY DOES HE NEED TO DO THAT?

06:43.567 --> 06:44.867
THOSE PEOPLE HAVE JUST BEEN SHOT

06:44.934 --> 06:46.300
BY A GIANT, SNEAKY PENIS.

06:46.367 --> 06:47.900
HAVEN'T THEY BEEN THROUGH

06:47.967 --> 06:49.233
ENOUGH?

06:49.300 --> 06:50.467
SECOND, THAT TAGLINE TRANSLATES

06:50.533 --> 06:52.533
TO -- AND THIS IS TRUE --

06:52.600 --> 06:55.200
"PENIS CAN SURPRISE YOU," WHICH

06:55.266 --> 06:56.967
JUST SOUNDS LIKE HOW AN OLD

06:57.033 --> 06:57.934
RUSSIAN MAN HITS ON YOU AT AN

06:58.000 --> 06:59.633
AIRPORT BAR.

06:59.700 --> 07:00.734
"I MAY NOT BE MUCH TO LOOK AT,

07:00.800 --> 07:03.567
BUT PENIS CAN SURPRISE YOU."

07:03.633 --> 07:05.133
AND FINALLY, I LIKE THAT WHEN

07:05.200 --> 07:07.800
THE PENIS IS ABOUT TO EJACULATE,

07:07.867 --> 07:09.567
IT BENDS IN HALF SO THE SHAFT

07:09.633 --> 07:11.000
FORMS A RIGHT ANGLE.

07:11.066 --> 07:12.433
AND IF YOUR PENIS CAN DO THAT,

07:12.500 --> 07:14.800
PLEASE SEND VIDEO PROOF TO

07:14.867 --> 07:17.934
Sessions.Jefferson@USDOJ.gov.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.433
AND LOOK, LOOK, ALL JOKING

07:21.500 --> 07:22.834
ASIDE HERE, LET'S BE SERIOUS FOR

07:22.900 --> 07:23.633
A MINUTE.

07:23.700 --> 07:24.600
LET'S BE SERIOUS, BECAUSE

07:24.667 --> 07:25.633
PRACTICING SAFE SEX IS EXTREMELY

07:25.700 --> 07:26.767
IMPORTANT.

07:26.834 --> 07:27.967
KNOWING WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT

07:28.033 --> 07:29.066
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH, IT'S

07:29.133 --> 07:30.100
FRANKLY RIDICULOUS THAT CONDOM

07:30.166 --> 07:31.333
USAGE IS STILL NOT UNIVERSAL.

07:31.400 --> 07:32.567
YOU'RE PUTTING YOURSELF AND YOUR

07:32.633 --> 07:33.533
FUTURE PARTNERS AT RISK, NOT

07:33.600 --> 07:35.033
JUST FOR CHLAMYDIA, BUT ALSO FOR

07:35.100 --> 07:37.533
HIV AND EVEN CANCER, SO --

07:37.600 --> 07:40.700
>>

07:40.767 --> 07:42.967
>> John: OH, FUCK YOU!

07:43.033 --> 07:43.600
YOU SNEAKY PENIS!

07:43.667 --> 07:51.100
AND NOW THIS.

07:51.166 --> 07:53.166
>> Announcer: AND NOW, LOCAL

07:53.233 --> 07:55.467
NEWS IS CONCERNED ABOUT TEENS.

07:55.533 --> 07:56.567
>> TEENS CHUGGING HAND SANITIZER

07:56.633 --> 07:59.500
TO GET DRUNK.

07:59.567 --> 08:01.467
>> HERE IS A NEW TREND AMONG

08:01.533 --> 08:03.467
TEENS YOU SHOULD HEAR ABOUT.

08:03.533 --> 08:04.200
PUTTING LIP BALM ON YOUR

ABOUT A DIFFERENT CHALLENGE

08:28.734 --> 08:29.467
WHERE PEOPLE FILL A CONDOM WITH

08:29.533 --> 08:30.367

08:37.567 --> 08:38.934
>> John: MOVING ON.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.900
FOR OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT,

08:41.967 --> 08:43.433
LET'S TALK ABOUT MEXICO,

08:43.500 --> 08:45.000
NUMBER 7 ON THE LIST OF THINGS

08:45.066 --> 08:46.633
DONALD TRUMP IS MOST FRIGHTENED

08:46.700 --> 08:48.200
OF, JUST AHEAD OF MUSLIMS AND

08:48.266 --> 08:48.967
JUST BEHIND THE CONCEPT OF

08:49.033 --> 08:51.467
SELF-REFLECTION.

08:51.533 --> 08:52.934
MEXICO IS A NATION OF

08:53.000 --> 08:54.200
123 MILLION PEOPLE, GIVE OR TAKE

08:54.266 --> 08:55.033
A FEW AMERICAN SPRING BREAK

08:55.100 --> 08:56.367
DOUCHEBAGS LIKE THESE TWO.

08:56.433 --> 08:57.567
>> CANCUN IS THE HANDS-DOWN BEST

08:57.633 --> 08:58.967
PLACE YOU CAN COME FOR SPRING

08:59.033 --> 08:59.767
BREAK, ESPECIALLY BEING A

08:59.834 --> 09:04.100
COLLEGE KID.

09:04.166 --> 09:05.133
GETTING TIPSY AND THEN

09:05.200 --> 09:06.333
GETTING DRUNK AND THEN A LITTLE

09:06.400 --> 09:07.100
BIT OF YAYO ON TOP OF

09:07.166 --> 09:08.300
EVERYTHING.

09:08.367 --> 09:09.300
A LOT A BIT OF YAYO.

09:09.367 --> 09:12.166
>> IF YOU GET TIRED HERE, CANCUN

09:12.233 --> 09:13.400
IS THE BEST FOR THAT, SO...

09:13.467 --> 09:15.266
>> John: COOL.

09:15.333 --> 09:16.600
INCIDENTALLY, MY FAVORITE PART

09:16.667 --> 09:18.333
OF THAT CLIP IS THAT, IN THE

09:18.400 --> 09:19.800
CORNER, IT PROMOTES SOMETHING

09:19.867 --> 09:21.066
CALLED "BRAIN SURGERY LIVE,"

09:21.133 --> 09:23.800
WHICH I SINCERELY HOPE IS JUST A

09:23.867 --> 09:25.633
BRAIN SURGEON LOBOTOMIZING THESE

09:25.700 --> 09:26.734
TWO BROS.

09:26.800 --> 09:27.800
BUT MEXICO ISN'T JUST A TOURIST

09:27.867 --> 09:28.934
DESTINATION.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.567
WE SHARE A 1,900-MILE BORDER,

09:30.633 --> 09:32.133
AND THEY'RE OUR THIRD LARGEST

09:32.200 --> 09:33.166
TRADING PARTNER, AND SOMETHING

09:33.233 --> 09:33.900
MASSIVE IS ABOUT TO TAKE PLACE

09:33.967 --> 09:36.433
THERE.

09:36.500 --> 09:38.000
>> IT'S GOING TO BE THE BIGGEST

09:38.066 --> 09:39.433
ELECTION IN MEXICAN HISTORY,

09:39.500 --> 09:41.000
WITH POSITIONS UP FOR GRABS FROM

09:41.066 --> 09:42.300
MEXICO CITY MAYOR TO

09:42.367 --> 09:43.867
CONGRESSIONAL SEATS TO THE TOP

09:43.934 --> 09:45.400
JOB ITSELF.

09:45.467 --> 09:46.767
>> John: IT'S TRUE, NEXT SUNDAY

09:46.834 --> 09:50.734
WILL SEE THE BIGGEST ELECTION IN

09:50.800 --> 09:52.100
MEXICO'S HISTORY, WHICH I KNOW

09:52.166 --> 09:52.700
PROBABLY DOESN'T MEAN MUCH TO

09:52.767 --> 09:53.100
MOST AMERICANS.

09:53.166 --> 09:54.033
IT'S LIKE SAYING "THE BIGGEST

09:54.100 --> 09:55.266
MATTRESS SALE IN DUTCH HISTORY"

09:55.333 --> 09:56.233
OR "THE BIGGEST MOUSE PENIS IN

09:56.300 --> 09:58.100
PORTUGUESE HISTORY."

09:58.166 --> 09:59.266
GREAT, THEIR MOUSE IS SORT OF

09:59.333 --> 10:00.300
HUNG, HOW DOES THIS AFFECT ME IN

10:00.367 --> 10:04.033
ANY WAY?

10:04.100 --> 10:05.400
BUT WHAT THIS ACTUALLY MEANS IS

10:05.467 --> 10:06.266
THAT THEY COULD REPLACE THEIR

10:06.333 --> 10:07.233
PRESIDENT, THEIR ENTIRE

10:07.300 --> 10:08.033
CONGRESS, AND HUGE CHUNKS OF

10:08.100 --> 10:09.000
THEIR STATE AND LOCAL

10:09.066 --> 10:09.800
GOVERNMENTS, AND MANY BELIEVE A

10:09.867 --> 10:13.800
MAJOR SHIFT MAY BE ABOUT TO TAKE

10:13.867 --> 10:16.333
PLACE THERE, BECAUSE MEXICANS

10:16.400 --> 10:16.967
ARE SICK AND TIRED OF THE

10:17.033 --> 10:17.700
STATUS QUO.

10:17.767 --> 10:18.500
THEIR CURRENT PRESIDENT'S

10:18.567 --> 10:19.166
APPROVAL RATING SUNK AS LOW AS

10:19.233 --> 10:19.834
12% LAST YEAR, AND IT'S BECOME

10:19.900 --> 10:20.500
COMMON FOR PEOPLE TO SHOUT A

10:20.567 --> 10:21.433
PARTICULAR PHRASE AT HIM.

10:43.700 --> 10:43.967
>> John: WOW.

10:44.033 --> 10:45.333
"GO FUCK YOUR MOTHER" IS

10:45.400 --> 10:50.934
SOMETHING PEOPLE ONLY SHOUT AT

10:51.000 --> 10:51.834
YOU WHEN THEY ARE ANGRY.

10:51.900 --> 10:52.433
NOBODY SHOUTS IT BECAUSE THEY

10:52.500 --> 10:53.033
THINK YOU AND YOUR MOTHER HAVE

10:53.100 --> 10:57.867
GREAT CHEMISTRY.

10:57.934 --> 10:58.767
THAT'S NEVER HAPPENED.

10:58.834 --> 10:59.467
SO TONIGHT, LET'S LOOK AT WHY

10:59.533 --> 11:01.233
PEOPLE ARE SO ANGRY AT MEXICO'S

11:01.300 --> 11:03.500
CURRENT PRESIDENT,

11:03.567 --> 11:04.800
ENRIQUE PENA NIETO, AND WHO

11:04.867 --> 11:05.400
THEY'RE CONSIDERING TO REPLACE

11:05.467 --> 11:05.767
HIM.

11:05.834 --> 11:06.567
AND IF WE'RE HONEST, MOST

11:06.633 --> 11:07.266
AMERICANS DON'T REALLY KNOW MUCH

11:07.333 --> 11:09.000
ABOUT HIM.

11:09.066 --> 11:10.367
FOR INSTANCE:

11:10.433 --> 11:11.333
THAT'S NOT PENA NIETO.

11:11.400 --> 11:11.967
THAT'S JUST WHAT CAME UP WHEN WE

11:12.033 --> 11:12.834
TYPED "MEXICAN MAN" INTO A STOCK

11:12.900 --> 11:13.500
IMAGE SITE.

11:13.567 --> 11:15.367
BUT AS LONG AS HE'S HERE, LET'S

11:15.433 --> 11:16.834
GIVE THIS GUY A SPIN:

11:16.900 --> 11:17.667
LOOK AT HIM GO!

11:17.734 --> 11:18.700
THIS MAN IS ABSOLUTELY LEAVING

11:18.767 --> 11:24.667
IT ALL ON THE FIELD!

11:24.734 --> 11:31.200
JUST SO YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE

11:31.266 --> 11:33.100
REAL PENA NIETO, ALTHOUGH HE IS

11:33.166 --> 11:33.667
ALSO SO HANDSOME HE ACTUALLY

11:33.734 --> 11:34.433
RESEMBLES A STOCK PHOTO MODEL.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.467
HE WAS SWEPT INTO OFFICE IN 2012

11:36.533 --> 11:40.367
ON A WAVE OF HYPE.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.600
HE MADE THE COVER OF "TIME" WITH

11:42.667 --> 11:44.266
THE HEADLINE "SAVING MEXICO,"

11:44.333 --> 11:45.433
AND U.S. COVERAGE OF HIS

11:45.500 --> 11:46.100
ELECTION WAS BREATHLESS.

11:46.166 --> 11:46.800
>> THE DASHING 45-YEAR-OLD

11:46.867 --> 11:47.567
FORMER GOVERNOR IS MARRIED TO A

11:47.633 --> 11:49.433
FAMOUS MEXICAN SOAP OPERA STAR.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.166
WHEREVER THE COUPLE WENT, THEY

11:50.233 --> 11:51.066
DREW HUGE CROWDS, ESPECIALLY

11:51.133 --> 11:51.667
WOMEN, WHO, DESPITE THE FACT

11:51.734 --> 11:52.834
PENA NIETO WAS MARRIED, COULDNT

11:52.900 --> 11:55.400
GET ENOUGH OF HIM, CALLING HIM

11:55.467 --> 11:56.633
"BOMBON," WHICH MEANS

11:56.700 --> 11:57.166
"SWEET THING" OR "HOTTIE."

11:57.233 --> 11:57.900
THE FACT HE ADMITTED CHEATING

11:57.967 --> 11:58.633
TWICE ON HIS FIRST WIFE AND

11:58.700 --> 11:59.767
BEARING TWO CHILDREN OUT OF

11:59.834 --> 12:01.400
WEDLOCK BEFORE SHE DIED OF

12:01.467 --> 12:03.133
EPILEPSY DIDN'T SEEM TO FAZE THE

12:03.200 --> 12:12.433
ADORING CROWD.

12:12.500 --> 12:14.800
>> John: YEAH!

12:14.867 --> 12:15.934
ALL OF THAT'S TRUE.

12:16.000 --> 12:16.533
AND THAT WOULD BE UNFORGIVABLE

12:16.600 --> 12:17.467
IF HE WASN'T SO VIOLENTLY

12:17.533 --> 12:17.867
ATTRACTIVE.

12:17.934 --> 12:18.834
HOW'RE YOU GOING TO STAY MAD AT

12:18.900 --> 12:19.233
THAT?

12:19.300 --> 12:20.033
HE'S VISUALLY FUCKTACULAR.

12:20.100 --> 12:20.767
AND PENA NIETO'S ELECTION WAS

12:20.834 --> 12:22.000
DRAMATIC FOR A NUMBER OF

12:22.066 --> 12:22.667
REASONS.

12:22.734 --> 12:23.633
HIS PARTY, THE INSTITUTIONAL

12:23.700 --> 12:24.700
REVOLUTIONARY PARTY, OR PRI, HAD

12:24.767 --> 12:25.467
PREVIOUSLY ENJOYED A

12:25.533 --> 12:26.166
71-YEAR-LONG ERA OF ONE-PARTY

12:26.233 --> 12:27.700
RULE IN MEXICO, WHICH ONLY ENDED

12:27.767 --> 12:31.166
IN 2000.

12:31.233 --> 12:32.333
SO REAL MULTI-PARTY DEMOCRACY IS

12:32.400 --> 12:34.233
VERY MUCH A NEW THING THERE.

12:34.300 --> 12:35.533
AND FOR MANY, THE HOPE WAS THAT

12:35.600 --> 12:38.834
PENA NIETO WOULD CLEAN THE

12:38.900 --> 12:40.000
PARTY'S IMAGE AND RESTORE IT

12:40.066 --> 12:40.467
TO GLORY.

12:40.533 --> 12:44.834
BUT, TO PUT IT MILDLY, THAT

12:44.900 --> 12:45.400
DID NOT HAPPEN.

12:45.467 --> 12:46.100
HE HIMSELF WAS IMPLICATED IN A

12:46.166 --> 12:46.867
NUMBER OF SERIOUS SCANDALS, AND

12:46.934 --> 12:47.734
ON HIS WATCH, NOT ONLY DID

12:47.800 --> 12:48.734
CORRUPTION NOT IMPROVE, IT HIT

12:48.800 --> 12:50.400
SUCH A FEVER PITCH THAT VISITORS

12:50.467 --> 12:51.734
TO MEXICO CITY COULD DO THIS.

12:51.800 --> 12:53.633
>> THIS IS THE CORRUPT TOUR, A

12:53.700 --> 12:55.033
90-MINUTE BUS RIDE TO THE

12:55.100 --> 12:56.600
SEAMIER SIDE OF MEXICAN BUSINESS

12:56.667 --> 12:58.266
AND POLITICS.

12:58.333 --> 13:00.367
ON ITS ITINERARY, TEN CITY

13:00.433 --> 13:01.934
LANDMARKS WHERE PUBLIC MONEY HAS

13:02.000 --> 13:03.467
ALLEGEDLY BEEN DIVERTED FOR

13:03.533 --> 13:05.166
PRIVATE GAIN.

13:05.233 --> 13:06.266
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

13:06.333 --> 13:07.633
THERE WERE ACTUALLY BUS TOURS OF

13:07.700 --> 13:08.467
MEXICO'S MOST APPALLING

13:08.533 --> 13:13.200
LANDMARKS.

13:13.266 --> 13:15.266
AND I SINCERELY HOPE THAT THAT

13:15.333 --> 13:16.367
TOUR INCLUDES

13:16.433 --> 13:17.033
GUILLERMO DEL TORO'S

13:17.100 --> 13:17.767
TWO OSCARS FOR

13:17.834 --> 13:18.633
"THE SHAPE OF WATER."

13:18.700 --> 13:19.467
GUESS WHAT?

13:19.533 --> 13:20.800
I WAS ROOTING FOR THE FISH-MAN

13:20.867 --> 13:21.066
TO DIE.

13:21.133 --> 13:21.667
THE FISH-MAN WAS GROSS AND I

13:21.734 --> 13:22.433
DIDN'T ENJOY WATCHING HIM FUCK

13:22.500 --> 13:23.200
AND ANYONE WHO DID IS WEIRD AND

13:23.266 --> 13:24.467
WRONG.

13:24.533 --> 13:25.834
BUT THE SHEER SCALE OF

13:25.900 --> 13:26.767
GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION IN MEXICO

13:26.834 --> 13:28.834
IS HARD TO COMPREHEND.

13:28.900 --> 13:30.500
MANY, MANY POLITICIANS HAVE

13:30.567 --> 13:33.266
CLOSE TIES TO CARTELS AND GANGS,

13:33.333 --> 13:34.200
AT LEAST 14 CURRENT OR FORMER

13:34.266 --> 13:35.066
GOVERNORS OF MEXICAN STATES ARE

13:35.133 --> 13:36.266
UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR

13:36.333 --> 13:40.967
CORRUPTION, SOME OF THEM FOR

13:41.033 --> 13:43.600
COLLUDING WITH ORGANIZED CRIME.

13:43.667 --> 13:48.333
LIKE JAVIER DUARTE.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.200
HE'S THE GOVERNOR OF VERACRUZ.

13:50.266 --> 13:52.767
ON HIS WATCH, THE STATE WAS

13:52.834 --> 13:53.500
BANKRUPTED, WITH NEARLY

13:53.567 --> 13:54.000
$3 BILLION MISSING FROM

13:54.066 --> 13:54.400
OFFICIAL COFFERS.

13:54.467 --> 13:55.000
HE'S BEEN CHARGED WITH

13:55.066 --> 13:56.133
RACKETEERING AND USING ILLEGALLY

13:56.200 --> 13:56.734
OBTAINED FUNDS, AMONG OTHER

13:56.800 --> 13:57.200
THINGS.

13:57.266 --> 13:57.934
AND WHILE HE DENIES THOSE

13:58.000 --> 13:58.767
CHARGES, IT DIDN'T LOOK GREAT

13:58.834 --> 13:59.700
THAT HE FLED THE COUNTRY IN A

13:59.767 --> 14:00.700
HELICOPTER, ONLY TO BE TRACKED

14:00.767 --> 14:01.467
DOWN AND ARRESTED.

14:01.533 --> 14:05.667
AND BY THE WAY, WHAT IS THAT

14:05.734 --> 14:08.333
SMILE THERE?

14:08.400 --> 14:09.333
THAT IS NOT THE FACE A GROWN MAN

14:09.400 --> 14:13.333
MAKES AFTER BEING ARRESTED.

14:13.400 --> 14:13.967
THAT IS THE FACE A NINE-YEAR-OLD

14:14.033 --> 14:14.600
MAKES AFTER URINATING IN A

14:14.667 --> 14:15.934
PUBLIC POOL.

14:16.000 --> 14:16.667
AND THIS PERVASIVE CORRUPTION

14:16.734 --> 14:17.567
CONTRIBUTES TO A SENSE OF

14:17.633 --> 14:19.533
IMPUNITY AND DIMINISHED FAITH IN

14:19.600 --> 14:21.900
COPS OR COURTS.

14:21.967 --> 14:22.700
VIOLENCE HAS SPIKED IN MEXICO,

14:22.767 --> 14:24.433
WITH THE COUNTRY ON TRACK FOR

14:24.500 --> 14:25.967
32,000 MURDERS THIS YEAR, TWICE

14:26.033 --> 14:29.000
AS MANY AS IN 2014.

14:29.066 --> 14:31.066
AND YET ONLY 2% OF CRIMES IN

14:31.133 --> 14:33.834
MEXICO GET SOLVED, WHICH MAY

14:33.900 --> 14:34.867
EXPLAIN WHY THESE TWO YAYO

14:34.934 --> 14:35.967
FIENDS DIDN'T SEEM TO PUT MUCH

14:36.033 --> 14:37.734
EFFORT INTO THEIR FUCKING

14:37.800 --> 14:39.266
DISGUISES.

14:39.333 --> 14:40.567
AND FOR MANY, THE INCIDENT THAT

14:40.633 --> 14:42.233
ENCAPSULATES ALL OF THIS

14:42.300 --> 14:43.100
FRUSTRATION --

14:43.166 --> 14:44.767
GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION, VIOLENCE,

14:44.834 --> 14:46.867
AND A LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY --

14:46.934 --> 14:48.500
IS WHAT HAPPENED ON PENA NIETO'S

14:48.567 --> 14:50.200
WATCH IN 2014.

14:50.266 --> 14:52.667
>> 43 STUDENTS DISAPPEARED

14:52.734 --> 14:54.400
SEPTEMBER 26 AFTER BOARDING A

14:54.467 --> 14:55.633
BUS TO THE TOWN OF IGUALA TO

14:55.700 --> 14:56.233
RAISE MONEY FOR AN UPCOMING

14:56.300 --> 14:57.767
TRIP.

14:57.834 --> 14:59.033
AUTHORITIES SAY THE MAYOR THERE

14:59.100 --> 15:00.133
FEARED THE STUDENTS WOULD

15:00.200 --> 15:01.433
DISRUPT AN EVENT FOR HIS WIFE

15:01.500 --> 15:03.934
AND HAD POLICE STOP THEM.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.533
THE OFFICERS OPENED FIRE AND

15:06.600 --> 15:07.300
TURNED THE STUDENTS OVER TO A

15:07.367 --> 15:08.166
DRUG GANG, WHICH KILLED THEM AND

15:08.233 --> 15:10.367
BURNED THEIR BODIES.

15:10.433 --> 15:12.333
>> John: IT WAS HORRIFIC.

15:12.400 --> 15:17.567
AND INCREDIBLY, IT GOT WORSE

15:17.633 --> 15:18.333
THAN THAT, BECAUSE THERE IS

15:18.400 --> 15:19.333
EVIDENCE THE FEDERAL POLICE AND

15:19.400 --> 15:20.300
MILITARY WERE INVOLVED IN THE

15:20.367 --> 15:21.066
STUDENTS' DISAPPEARANCES BUT THE

15:21.133 --> 15:22.300
GOVERNMENT DID NOT PURSUE IT.

15:22.367 --> 15:23.467
AND WHEN YOU HEAR ALL OF THAT,

15:23.533 --> 15:25.000
YOU CAN SORT OF UNDERSTAND WHY

15:25.066 --> 15:26.967
SO MANY PEOPLE WANT TO TELL

15:27.033 --> 15:32.700
PENA NIETO "CHINGA TU MADRE."

15:32.767 --> 15:33.567
NOW, HE IS NOT RUNNING FOR

15:33.633 --> 15:34.734
RE-ELECTION, AS MEXICO'S

15:34.800 --> 15:35.433
PRESIDENTS ARE LIMITED TO ONE

15:35.500 --> 15:36.300
TERM.

15:36.367 --> 15:37.266
SO WHO ARE HIS POTENTIAL

15:37.333 --> 15:37.900
REPLACEMENTS?

15:37.967 --> 15:38.867
WELL, THERE'S JOSE ANTONIO

15:38.934 --> 15:39.500
MEADE, ALSO FROM THE PRI PARTY.

15:39.567 --> 15:40.734
BUT HE HAS NO CHANCE, SO WE'RE

15:40.800 --> 15:44.300
NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT HIM.

15:44.367 --> 15:45.767
THERE IS ALSO JAIME RODRIGUEZ,

15:45.834 --> 15:48.133
AN INDEPENDENT CANDIDATE AND

15:48.200 --> 15:48.700
STATE GOVERNOR KNOWN AS

15:48.767 --> 15:52.166
"EL BRONCO."

15:52.233 --> 15:52.767
HE ALSO HAS NO CHANCE, BUT WE

15:52.834 --> 15:53.467
ARE VERY MUCH GOING TO

15:53.533 --> 15:54.133
TALK ABOUT HIM, BECAUSE HE IS A

15:54.200 --> 15:54.767
HUMAN WRECKING BALL.

15:54.834 --> 15:55.700
JUST WATCH HIS IDEA FOR STOPPING

15:55.767 --> 15:56.834
GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION.

15:56.900 --> 15:57.700
>> WE NEED TO CUT OFF THE HAND

15:57.767 --> 15:58.567
OF ANYONE WHO STEALS IN THE

15:58.633 --> 15:59.533
PUBLIC SERVICE.

15:59.600 --> 16:00.800
>> YOU'RE NOT SPEAKING

16:00.867 --> 16:01.767
LITERALLY, ARE YOU, CANDIDATE?

16:01.834 --> 16:03.166
>> YES, OF COURSE.

16:03.233 --> 16:04.033
>> CUT OFF THEIR HAND LITERALLY?

16:04.100 --> 16:05.066
>> LITERALLY.

16:05.133 --> 16:06.834
>> WELL, EXPLAIN TO ME, PLEASE.

16:06.900 --> 16:07.867
>> ANYONE WHO STEALS MUST HAVE

16:07.934 --> 16:09.200
HIS HAND CUT OFF.

16:09.266 --> 16:10.867
A BILL MUST BE PRESENTED SO THAT

16:10.934 --> 16:11.800
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS APPROVE THIS

16:11.867 --> 16:12.767
PENALTY.

16:12.834 --> 16:13.567
>> CUT OFF THE HAND OF THE

16:13.633 --> 16:14.433
CRIMINALS?

16:14.500 --> 16:15.300
>> OF COURSE.

16:15.367 --> 16:16.400
>> THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO

16:16.467 --> 16:17.400
PROPOSE IN THE CONGRESS?

16:17.467 --> 16:18.533
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

16:18.600 --> 16:20.033
>> John: THAT MODERATOR GAVE HIM

16:20.100 --> 16:22.367
FIVE SEPARATE CHANCES TO SAY HE

16:22.433 --> 16:23.333
WASN'T BEING SERIOUS AND HE JUST

16:23.400 --> 16:24.567
BRONCO'D HIS WAY THROUGH ALL

16:24.633 --> 16:25.900
FIVE OF THEM.

16:25.967 --> 16:27.300
AND CHOPPING OFF SOMEBODY'S HAND

16:27.367 --> 16:28.834
IS A PRETTY DRASTIC PUNISHMENT

16:28.900 --> 16:30.467
FOR POLITICAL CORRUPTION,

16:30.533 --> 16:32.100
ALTHOUGH A PERFECT WAY TO

16:32.166 --> 16:33.333
ELIMINATE CONTESTANTS FROM MY

16:33.400 --> 16:35.734
NEW REALITY COMPETITION SHOW,

16:35.800 --> 16:37.200
"AMERICA'S NEXT TOP

16:37.266 --> 16:38.233
SOCK PUPPETEER."

16:38.300 --> 16:39.433
"I'M SORRY, FLOPSY BUNNY JUST

16:39.500 --> 16:41.734
DIDN'T WOW US.

16:41.800 --> 16:42.900
ANTHONY, PLEASE PLACE YOUR HAND

16:42.967 --> 16:45.500
ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK."

16:45.567 --> 16:46.934
BUT THAT IS NOT EL BRONCO'S

16:47.000 --> 16:48.567
BOLDEST POSITION, 'CAUSE HE ALSO

16:48.633 --> 16:49.734
HAS A FIRM AND UNWAVERING HATRED

16:49.800 --> 16:51.734
OF SANTA CLAUS.

16:51.800 --> 16:52.867
>> I DON'T BELIEVE IN

16:52.934 --> 16:54.233
SANTA CLAUS.

16:54.300 --> 16:56.467
DO YOU BELIEVE IN SANTA CLAUS?

16:56.533 --> 17:00.400
HOW MANY BELIEVE IN SANTA CLAUS?

17:00.467 --> 17:03.767
LOOK, JUST THREE.

17:03.834 --> 17:06.633
SANTA CLAUS IS BAD.

17:06.700 --> 17:08.333
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

17:08.400 --> 17:12.400
EL BRONCO HATES SANTA.

17:12.467 --> 17:13.133
AND IF YOU THINK WE ARE

17:13.200 --> 17:13.967
CHERRY-PICKING JUST ONE EXAMPLE

17:14.033 --> 17:14.867
OF VIRULENT ANTI-SANTA-ISM,

17:14.934 --> 17:16.400
THINK AGAIN.

17:16.467 --> 17:17.500
>> WHEN DID YOU TELL YOUR KIDS

17:17.567 --> 17:18.700
THERE WAS NO SANTA CLAUS?

17:18.767 --> 17:19.333
>> EVERY DAY.

17:19.400 --> 17:20.300
>> EVERY DAY?

17:20.367 --> 17:22.900
>> YES.

17:22.967 --> 17:24.934
>> John: HE TELLS HIS CHILDREN

17:25.000 --> 17:25.967
EVERY DAY THAT SANTA IS NOT

17:26.033 --> 17:27.166
REAL.

17:27.233 --> 17:29.266
THAT IS HARSH.

17:29.333 --> 17:30.333
THAT IS SO HARSH.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.266
>> HO, HO, HO!

17:32.333 --> 17:32.967
>> John: HOLD ON,

17:33.033 --> 17:34.300
WHO'S THAT?

17:34.367 --> 17:36.066
WHO'S THAT?

17:36.133 --> 17:39.000
>> HO, HO, HO!

17:39.066 --> 17:40.200
HELLO, BOYS AND GIRLS!

17:40.266 --> 17:41.967
IT'S ME, SANTA!

17:42.033 --> 17:43.133
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

17:43.200 --> 17:44.700
>> John: SANTA!

17:44.767 --> 17:45.600
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE HERE!

17:45.667 --> 17:46.734
THIS IS FANTASTIC!

17:46.800 --> 17:48.700
>> AH, YES.

17:48.767 --> 17:50.033
I JUST WANTED TO TELL MEXICAN

17:50.100 --> 17:52.233
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE EL BRONCO

17:52.300 --> 17:54.667
THAT I DO EXIST!

17:54.734 --> 17:56.233
I BRING MAGIC TO CHILDREN ALL

17:56.300 --> 17:58.133
OVER THE WORLD!

17:58.200 --> 17:59.233
SO THAT EL BRONCO IS ON MY

17:59.300 --> 18:00.433
NAUGHTY LIST.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.300
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I MUST

18:05.367 --> 18:08.333
GET BACK TO THE NORTH POLE.

18:08.400 --> 18:09.700
>> John: OOH, ACTUALLY, SANTA,

18:09.767 --> 18:11.033
I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED, WHAT DO

18:11.100 --> 18:12.467
YOU DO UP THERE ALL YEAR WHEN

18:12.533 --> 18:14.400
YOU'RE NOT DELIVERING PRESENTS?

18:14.467 --> 18:17.266
>> WHY, I MASTURBATE, DEAR BOY!

18:17.333 --> 18:18.367
I MASTURBATE ALL DAY AND ALL

18:18.433 --> 18:22.200
NIGHT!

18:22.266 --> 18:23.734
I MASTURBATE AND MASTURBATE

18:23.800 --> 18:25.734
UNTIL MY SACK FULL OF PRESENTS

18:25.800 --> 18:27.033
IS EMPTY, IF YOU CATCH MY

18:27.100 --> 18:27.633
MEANING.

18:28.967 --> 18:30.000
>> John: WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT,

18:30.066 --> 18:32.033
SANTA?

18:32.100 --> 18:33.767
>> EVERY DAY IS CHRISTMAS FOR

18:33.834 --> 18:35.900
SANTA WHEN HE MASTURBATES!

18:35.967 --> 18:38.166
I EVEN DO IT SOMETIMES WHEN I'M

18:38.233 --> 18:40.333
FLYING ON MY BIG RED SLEIGH.

18:40.400 --> 18:42.133
I TRY NOT TO GET ANY ON THE

18:42.200 --> 18:43.033
REINDEER, BUT EVEN SANTA'S NOT

18:43.100 --> 18:45.633
PERFECT.

18:45.700 --> 18:47.734
HO, HO, HO, HO, HO!

18:47.800 --> 18:48.934
>> John: THIS IS SO DIFFERENT

18:49.000 --> 18:53.467
THAN WHAT I THOUGHT MEETING YOU

18:53.533 --> 18:54.166
WOULD BE LIKE, SANTA.

18:54.233 --> 18:56.467
>> YEAH, NO, I GET THAT A LOT.

18:56.533 --> 18:59.834
I'M NOT SURE WHY.

18:59.900 --> 19:00.500
I MEAN, LOOK AT ME, I'M VERY

19:00.567 --> 19:01.500
WEIRD!

19:01.567 --> 19:02.266
AND I LOVE TO STROKE IT TILL IT

19:02.333 --> 19:03.667
LOOKS LIKE A CANDY CANE!

19:03.734 --> 19:05.667
>> John: PLEASE LEAVE!

19:05.734 --> 19:07.767
PLEASE LEAVE, SANTA!

19:07.834 --> 19:12.767
PLEASE LEAVE!

19:12.834 --> 19:13.800
JUST LEAVE, SANTA, LEAVE!

19:13.867 --> 19:15.567
NEVER MEET YOUR HEROES.

19:15.633 --> 19:16.867
EVER.

19:16.934 --> 19:18.467
THE POINT IS, EL BRONCO IS NOT

19:18.533 --> 19:20.433
GOING TO BE THE MEXICAN

19:20.500 --> 19:21.400
PRESIDENT.

19:21.467 --> 19:23.567
THE CANDIDATE CURRENTLY POLLING

19:23.633 --> 19:25.200
SECOND IS THIS GUY,

19:25.266 --> 19:26.667

19:30.133 --> 19:31.166
20-MINUTE POLICY PRESENTATIONS

19:31.233 --> 19:34.567
THAT ARE SOMEHOW EVEN MORE

19:34.633 --> 19:36.767
EXPLAINER-Y THAN THE ONES ON

19:47.400 --> 19:48.367
REMAINS STEADY DESPITE NAFTA.

19:48.433 --> 19:52.667
>> John: RIGHT.

19:52.734 --> 19:55.567
I MEAN, YEAH, ON ONE HAND, THAT

19:55.633 --> 19:56.333
WAS EXTREMELY BORING.

19:56.400 --> 19:56.967
BUT AT LEAST WE NOW KNOW WHAT IT

19:57.033 --> 19:57.600
WOULD LOOK LIKE IF PITBULL WENT

19:57.667 --> 19:58.233
TO GRAD SCHOOL.

19:58.300 --> 19:59.066
CLEARLY, THIS GUY IS A BIT OF A

21:55.967 --> 21:59.900
LEGITIMATE PRESIDENT OF MEXICO.

21:59.967 --> 22:01.333
HIS SUPPORTERS OCCUPIED THE

22:01.400 --> 22:02.200
CITY'S CENTRAL SQUARE FOR

22:02.266 --> 22:03.633
MONTHS.

22:03.700 --> 22:05.233
AND THAT IS RIDICULOUS.

22:05.300 --> 22:06.367
WHEN AL GORE LOST THE 2000

22:06.433 --> 22:07.700
ELECTION, HE DIDN'T HOLD A FAKE

22:07.767 --> 22:09.433
INAUGURATION.

22:09.500 --> 22:10.467
HE JUST TOLD US WE WERE ALL

22:10.533 --> 22:11.300
GOING TO DIE AND IT WAS OUR

22:11.367 --> 22:14.834
FAULT.

22:14.900 --> 22:16.266
IT WAS JUST CALLED BASIC GOOD

22:16.333 --> 22:17.900
SPORTSMANSHIP.

22:17.967 --> 22:19.367
NOW, LOOK, AMLO'S CAMPAIGN HAS

22:19.433 --> 22:24.033
CAUGHT FIRE THIS TIME AROUND

22:24.100 --> 22:24.567
BECAUSE HE HAS TAPPED INTO

22:24.633 --> 22:25.400
POPULIST ANGER.

22:25.467 --> 22:26.567
HE'S PROMISED TO HELP THE POOR

22:26.633 --> 22:27.367
AND ERADICATE CORRUPTION AND HE

22:27.433 --> 22:27.967
OFTEN RAILS AGAINST THE ELITES

22:28.033 --> 22:28.533
AND THE MAFIA IN POWER.

22:47.033 --> 22:47.934
>> John: THAT SOUNDS GREAT!

22:48.000 --> 22:50.400
AND YOU CAN SEE THE APPEAL

22:50.467 --> 22:53.133
THERE.

22:53.200 --> 22:53.834
AMLO IS KIND OF LIKE

22:53.900 --> 22:54.600
BERNIE SANDERS BUT WITH A BETTER

22:54.667 --> 22:55.266
HAIRCUT AND SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER

22:55.333 --> 22:56.200
SPANISH.

22:56.266 --> 23:11.633
>> John: I HONESTLY THINK HE

23:11.700 --> 23:12.367
COULD'VE CARRIED 100% OF THE

23:12.433 --> 23:13.300
HISPANIC VOTE IF HIS SLOGAN HAD

23:13.367 --> 23:14.133
BEEN, "VOTE FOR ME AND I WILL

23:14.200 --> 23:14.867
NEVER SPEAK SPANISH AGAIN."

23:14.934 --> 23:15.767
NOW, AMLO'S GOALS MAY BE CLEAR,

23:15.834 --> 23:17.066
BUT THE DETAILS OF HOW HE PLANS

23:17.133 --> 23:17.667
TO ACHIEVE THEM CAN BE PRETTY

23:17.734 --> 23:18.900
SKETCHY.

23:18.967 --> 23:20.133
HIS OPPONENTS HAVE ATTACKED HIM

23:20.200 --> 23:21.200
AS A DANGEROUS LEFTIST, BUT

23:21.266 --> 23:22.433
JOURNALISTS WHO'VE COVERED HIM

23:22.500 --> 23:23.767
SAY IT'S HARD TO JUDGE THINGS

23:23.834 --> 23:25.600
BASED ON HIS POLICY PLATFORMS,

23:25.667 --> 23:26.800
BECAUSE THEY ARE PRONE TO

23:26.867 --> 23:28.266
CHANGE, OFTEN SEEMINGLY

23:28.333 --> 23:30.233
OVERNIGHT, AND THAT HE OFTEN

23:30.300 --> 23:31.734
MAKES BIG PROMISES WHILE KEEPING

23:31.800 --> 23:32.934
HIS OWN ADVISERS GUESSING AS TO

23:33.000 --> 23:37.533
WHAT HE REALLY MEANS.

23:37.600 --> 23:38.300
SO IN THAT WAY, HE'S MORE

23:38.367 --> 23:39.266
REMINISCENT OF A MEXICAN

23:39.333 --> 23:40.033
DONALD TRUMP, WHICH I KNOW IS A

23:40.100 --> 23:40.900
WEIRD IMAGE TO CONJURE UP, LIKE

23:40.967 --> 23:41.767
ORTHODOX HITLER OR

23:41.834 --> 23:42.633
JACKED GANDHI.

23:42.700 --> 23:43.367
BUT THE LACK OF CONCRETE POLICY

23:43.433 --> 23:44.266
HASN'T DAMPENED THE EXCITEMENT

23:44.333 --> 23:46.333
AROUND AMLO, WHOSE SUPPORTERS

23:46.400 --> 23:47.133
HAVE MADE SOME PRETTY STRIKING

23:47.200 --> 23:48.400
ADS.

24:11.600 --> 24:13.734
>> John: HOLY SHIT!

24:13.800 --> 24:15.200
THAT IS THE MOST TERRIFYING

24:15.266 --> 24:16.667
TIGER I'VE SEEN SINCE THE

24:16.734 --> 24:17.800
EPISODE OF "WINNIE THE POOH"

24:17.867 --> 24:19.767
WHERE TIGGER ATE EEYORE.

24:19.834 --> 24:20.667
AND WAS THAT REALLY A --

24:20.734 --> 24:22.100
THEY'RE WILD ANIMALS,

24:22.166 --> 24:23.266
CHRISTOPHER ROBIN!

24:23.333 --> 24:24.100
YOU CAN'T JUST KEEP THEM IN YOUR

24:24.166 --> 24:27.533
BACKYARD!

24:27.600 --> 24:28.266
IT WAS BOUND TO HAPPEN SOONER

24:28.333 --> 24:31.834
OR LATER.

24:31.900 --> 24:32.834
IT'S NOT A TRAGEDY.

24:32.900 --> 24:35.333
THAT WAS INEVITABLE.

24:35.400 --> 24:36.000
BUT THAT AD BECOMES LESS FUN

24:36.066 --> 24:37.100
WHEN YOU LEARN IT WAS MADE BY

24:37.166 --> 24:37.700
THE SOCIAL ENCOUNTER PARTY, AN

24:37.767 --> 24:38.433
EVANGELICAL CHRISTIAN PARTY THAT

24:38.500 --> 24:39.500
OPPOSES SAME-SEX MARRIAGE,

24:39.567 --> 24:41.600
HOMOSEXUALITY, AND ABORTION.

24:41.667 --> 24:42.600
THAT PARTY IS IN AMLO'S

24:42.667 --> 24:43.633
COALITION, WHICH KIND OF SPEAKS

24:43.700 --> 24:44.433
TO THE FACT THAT BY BEING SO

24:44.500 --> 24:45.300
VAGUE, HE CAN LET PEOPLE SEE

24:45.367 --> 24:47.667
WHAT THEY WANT TO SEE IN HIM.

24:47.734 --> 24:48.333
SO, SURE, A CHRISTIAN

24:48.400 --> 24:49.166
CONSERVATIVE PARTY CAN THINK

24:49.233 --> 24:50.166
HE'S ON THEIR SIDE, AS CAN THE

24:50.233 --> 24:50.900
PRESUMABLY MUCH MORE LIBERAL

24:50.967 --> 24:51.600
PEOPLE BEHIND THIS AD, WHICH

24:51.667 --> 24:52.633
PITCHES AMLO AS AN APHRODISIAC.

25:30.467 --> 25:33.000
>> John: OH, MY GOD.

25:33.066 --> 25:34.100
THAT IS THE MOST SEXUALLY

25:34.166 --> 25:35.467
EXPLICIT CAMPAIGN AD SINCE

25:35.533 --> 25:36.233
THEODORE ROOSEVELT'S

25:36.300 --> 25:37.767
FAMOUS SLOGAN OF

25:37.834 --> 25:42.834
"TEDDY WILL MAKE YOU CUM."

25:42.900 --> 25:44.266
THE POINT HERE IS, WHILE THE

25:44.333 --> 25:45.533
HOPE IN AMLO IS REAL, THE

25:45.600 --> 25:46.166
CONTENT IS A QUESTION MARK.

25:46.233 --> 25:47.000
AND IT SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT HOW

25:47.066 --> 25:48.567
ENTRENCHED THE PROBLEMS IN

25:48.633 --> 25:50.800
MEXICO ARE AND THE LEVEL OF

25:50.867 --> 25:51.533
PEOPLE'S DISSATISFACTION THAT

25:51.600 --> 25:52.333
THEY SEEM SO WILLING TO TAKE A

25:52.400 --> 25:54.767
GAMBLE ON HIM.

25:54.834 --> 25:55.300
AND LOOK, FOR MUCH OF THIS

25:55.367 --> 25:55.900
PIECE, WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE

25:55.967 --> 25:56.567
PROBLEMS IN MEXICO, OF WHICH

25:56.633 --> 25:58.367
THERE ARE MANY.

25:58.433 --> 25:59.300
BUT THAT IS WHAT MAKES IT ALL

25:59.367 --> 26:00.367
THE MORE IMPRESSIVE THAT PEOPLE

26:00.433 --> 26:01.367
ARE PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE

26:01.433 --> 26:03.700
LINE TO SOLVE THEM.

26:03.767 --> 26:04.667
THERE ARE JOURNALISTS TACKLING

26:04.734 --> 26:06.600
CORRUPTION, DESPITE THE FACT

26:06.667 --> 26:08.000
THAT MEXICO IS THE THIRD

26:08.066 --> 26:09.400
DEADLIEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD

26:09.467 --> 26:10.033
FOR THEM TO WORK, AFTER IRAQ AND

26:10.100 --> 26:11.333
SYRIA.

26:11.400 --> 26:13.333
AND THERE ARE HONEST POLITICIANS

26:13.400 --> 26:14.800
RUNNING FOR OFFICE, EVEN THOUGH

26:14.867 --> 26:16.000
120 POLITICIANS, INCLUDING 44

26:16.066 --> 26:17.600
CANDIDATES, HAVE BEEN KILLED

26:17.667 --> 26:21.266
DURING THIS CAMPAIGN.

26:21.333 --> 26:22.900
IN THE TOWN OF PIEDRAS NEGRAS,

26:22.967 --> 26:26.533
AN ANTI-CARTEL CONGRESSIONAL

26:26.600 --> 26:27.800
CANDIDATE WAS MURDERED JUST

26:27.867 --> 26:28.934
EARLIER THIS MONTH, BUT THE

26:29.000 --> 26:30.100
MAYOR THERE IS REFUSING TO HIDE.

26:30.166 --> 26:31.367
>> WE REACHED THE CURRENT MAYOR

26:31.433 --> 26:32.867
OF PIEDRAS NEGRAS,

26:32.934 --> 26:34.200
SONIA VILLARREAL, WHO SAYS HER

26:34.266 --> 26:34.700
LIFE WAS THREATENED JUST

26:34.767 --> 26:37.533
YESTERDAY.

26:37.600 --> 26:39.166
>> YOU'RE NOT FEARING THEM?

26:39.233 --> 26:40.934
>> NO.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.066
>> WOW.

26:42.133 --> 26:43.967
PORQUE?

26:44.033 --> 26:48.367
>> OKAY.

26:48.433 --> 26:49.600
YOU WON'T STOP.

26:49.667 --> 26:50.900
EVEN IF IT MEANS RISKING YOUR

26:50.967 --> 26:54.867
LIFE.

26:54.934 --> 26:56.066
DOESN'T MATTER.

26:56.133 --> 26:57.600
>> John: THAT IS JUST AMAZING.

26:57.667 --> 26:58.700
AND FOR THE RECORD, I AM NOT

26:58.767 --> 27:00.400
THAT BRAVE.

27:00.467 --> 27:04.266
I AM NOT THAT BRAVE AT ALL

27:04.333 --> 27:05.200
SURE, I'LL SHIT-TALK THE

27:05.266 --> 27:06.000
DRUG CARTELS FROM THE SAFETY OF

27:06.066 --> 27:08.200
NEW YORK.

27:08.266 --> 27:09.600
THIS IS THE ACTUAL HEAD OF THE

27:09.667 --> 27:10.400
SINALOA CARTEL, AND I'LL HAPPILY

27:10.467 --> 27:12.533
SAY HE LOOKS LIKE ANDY GARCIA

27:12.600 --> 27:14.033
WON A PIZZA-EATING CONTEST,

27:14.100 --> 27:14.800
BECAUSE FUCK THAT GUY.

27:14.867 --> 27:15.567
FUCK HIM.

27:15.633 --> 27:21.400
I'M NOT SCARED OF HIM.

27:21.467 --> 27:22.300
BUT I WOULDN'T HAVE THE COURAGE

27:22.367 --> 27:27.667
TO SAY THAT IN MEXICO.

27:27.734 --> 27:28.934
I WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE THE COURAGE

27:29.000 --> 27:29.800
TO SAY IT HERE.

27:29.867 --> 27:30.667
THAT'S NOT THE HEAD OF THE

27:30.734 --> 27:31.367
SINALOA CARTEL.

27:31.433 --> 27:32.100
THAT'S ANOTHER STOCK PHOTO.

27:32.166 --> 27:32.800
DO YOU THINK I'M FUCKING CRAZY?

27:32.867 --> 27:33.700
DO YOU THINK I'M INSANE?

27:33.767 --> 27:34.834
I'M A COWARD!

27:34.900 --> 27:36.033
THE POINT HERE IS, MEXICO IS ON

27:36.100 --> 27:37.233
THE VERGE OF THE BIGGEST

27:37.300 --> 27:40.333
ELECTION IN THEIR HISTORY, WITH

27:40.400 --> 27:40.867
A CHANCE TO COMBAT ENDEMIC

27:40.934 --> 27:41.500
CORRUPTION THAT HAS BETRAYED ITS

27:41.567 --> 27:44.133
PEOPLE FOR TOO LONG.

27:44.200 --> 27:46.333
AND I SINCERELY HOPE THE

27:46.400 --> 27:46.967
CANDIDATES THEY CHOOSE AT EVERY

27:47.033 --> 27:52.033
LEVEL ARE WORTHY OF THE TRUST

27:52.100 --> 27:52.834
THAT'S ABOUT TO BE PLACED IN

27:52.900 --> 27:53.767
THEM, BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO TAKE

27:53.834 --> 27:54.600
BRAVE, BOLD WORK TO GIVE THE

27:54.667 --> 27:55.400
COUNTRY THE CHANGE IT NEEDS.

27:55.467 --> 27:56.166
SANTA CLAUS IS NOT COMING TO

27:56.233 --> 27:57.200
SAVE MEXICO.

27:57.266 --> 27:59.066
AS WE LEARNED TONIGHT, THAT MAN

27:59.133 --> 28:01.433
IS VERY BUSY.

28:01.500 --> 28:05.934
>> HO, HO, HO!

28:06.000 --> 28:06.800
>> John: PLEASE, NO, NOT AGAIN.

28:06.867 --> 28:07.633
>> YES, I AM.

28:07.700 --> 28:08.400
>> John: SANTA, DON'T DO THIS,

28:08.467 --> 28:09.533
SANTA, PLEASE.

28:09.600 --> 28:10.867
>> DON'T DO WHAT?

28:10.934 --> 28:12.033
VIVIDLY DESCRIBE HOW I BRING

28:12.100 --> 28:14.000
MYSELF TO CLIMAX 364 DAYS OF THE

28:14.066 --> 28:15.934
YEAR?

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
WHY, I TINKER IN MY TOY SHOP,

28:17.066 --> 28:18.867
JOHN!

28:18.934 --> 28:21.934
I FILL MY STOCKING!

28:22.033 --> 28:25.900
I POLISH THE NORTH POLE!

28:25.967 --> 28:27.033
THE ELVES TAUGHT ME YOGA, AND

28:27.100 --> 28:28.934
NOW I CAN BLOW MYSELF!

28:29.000 --> 28:29.800
>> John: NO, SANTA, NO, SANTA,

28:29.867 --> 28:32.133
NO, NO, NO!

28:32.200 --> 28:33.266
AND NOW THIS.

28:33.333 --> 28:35.033
>> Announcer: AND NOW,

28:35.100 --> 28:36.767
KATHIE LEE AND HODA ARE SLOWLY

28:36.834 --> 28:37.867
BECOMING ONE.

28:37.934 --> 28:39.000
>> TIMING..

28:39.066 --> 28:44.934
>> IS EVERYTHING.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.967
>> BY THE WAY, IT'S...

28:49.033 --> 28:50.767
>> NATIONAL COOKIE DAY.

28:50.834 --> 28:51.667
>> WE ARE TALKING ABOUT...

28:51.734 --> 28:52.433
TYRA BANKS.

28:52.500 --> 28:53.300
RACHEL FONG.

28:53.367 --> 28:54.100
SIMONE BILES.

28:54.166 --> 28:55.000

28:55.066 --> 28:56.433
GAL GADOT.

28:56.500 --> 28:57.734
JOHN MANGANIELLO.

28:57.800 --> 28:58.600
GINGER.

28:58.667 --> 28:59.500
JORDAN AND KYLE TAKE THE AISLE.

28:59.567 --> 29:00.734
COME ON DOWN!

29:00.800 --> 29:01.900
>> ISN'T THAT AWESOME?

29:01.967 --> 29:02.934
>> MM-HMM.

29:03.000 --> 29:03.967
BANRES AND NOBLE.

29:04.033 --> 29:04.900
"READY PLAYER ONE."

29:04.967 --> 29:05.633
"BLOCKERS."

29:05.700 --> 29:06.700
"GET OUT."

29:06.767 --> 29:08.667
GUYS TELL ALL.

29:08.734 --> 29:09.133
GIRL, WASH YOUR FACE.

29:09.200 --> 29:10.133
HER FACE.

29:10.200 --> 29:11.333
THONG.

29:11.400 --> 29:12.433
ON THE OTHER HAND.

29:12.500 --> 29:13.467
AND IT FITS.

29:13.533 --> 29:14.567
MIRACLE.

29:14.633 --> 29:15.934
80 POUNDS.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.133
CHILLING WITH MY SNOW-MIES.

29:17.200 --> 29:18.533
ONE-POT PORK WITH PICKLED

29:18.600 --> 29:20.100
PEPPERS.

29:20.166 --> 29:21.200
BARBRA, THE MUSIC, THE MEMORIES,

29:21.266 --> 29:22.367
THE MAGIC.

29:22.433 --> 29:23.200
HUNGRY.

29:23.266 --> 29:24.667
HANGRY.

29:24.734 --> 29:25.667
OOH.

29:25.734 --> 29:26.834
AH.

29:26.900 --> 29:28.433
AH.

29:28.500 --> 29:29.467
AH.

29:29.533 --> 29:32.433
HOW DO WE DO IT DAY AFTER DAY?

29:32.500 --> 29:33.667
>> John: THAT'S OUR SHOW.

29:33.734 --> 29:34.567
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

29:34.633 --> 29:35.900
SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

29:35.967 --> 29:37.567
GOOD NIGHT!

29:46.800 --> 29:49.734
