WEBVTT

00:17.051 --> 00:20.077
This place is beautiful.

00:20.221 --> 00:22.655
It's all right.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.649
You're beautiful.

00:25.860 --> 00:28.328
Look, Ross, if you think
laying it on thick like that's

00:28.529 --> 00:29.518
gonna get you somewhere
tonight...

00:29.731 --> 00:31.699
I'm right?
...you're totally right.

00:32.834 --> 00:36.235
Okay, spill.
Why are we here?

00:40.174 --> 00:42.108
Hold that thought.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.586
Mr. Ross,
I hear it's a big night.

00:53.788 --> 00:56.018
Yeah. The biggest.

00:56.724 --> 00:59.022
Can you put this
in a glass of champagne?

00:59.227 --> 01:02.253
- Something nice?
- How unique.

01:03.164 --> 01:04.927
- Sal!
Hey!

01:05.132 --> 01:06.133
Long time no see.

01:06.334 --> 01:07.926
Too long, Maurice.
How you been, man?

01:08.136 --> 01:09.262
- Good, how are you doing?
- Good. Good to see you.

01:09.470 --> 01:11.097
Dude. Man, we were just talking.

01:11.305 --> 01:12.704
You got a problem?

01:12.907 --> 01:14.704
Chill out, Marv.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.211
It's all good, yeah?

01:18.413 --> 01:20.074
- Yeah.
- This way, gentlemen.

01:20.281 --> 01:22.749
- How you been?
- Good, Mr. Lassiter. Good.

01:26.554 --> 01:28.681
Sometimes you give,
and sometimes you get, huh?

01:28.890 --> 01:30.551
And sometimes you really get.

01:43.404 --> 01:46.373
Hey, Mindy. You miss me?

01:46.541 --> 01:47.974
Aw...

01:48.176 --> 01:50.076
I liked you as a blond.

02:18.940 --> 02:21.704
Better?
I hear they have more fun.

02:27.381 --> 02:28.905
Hello, Julian.

02:29.117 --> 02:32.450
I'm not looking for trouble.
I just want a drink.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.450
And I want
to eat Taylor Swift's heart,

02:34.655 --> 02:36.589
but we can't always get
what we want.

02:37.792 --> 02:39.885
Now get your shifter ass
out of here.

02:44.966 --> 02:46.399
I wasn't asking.

02:50.371 --> 02:51.531
You werewolves.

02:51.739 --> 02:54.537
You think you're so special,

02:54.742 --> 02:56.403
when really
you're just sons of bitches.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.216
That all you got?

03:09.423 --> 03:11.323
Oh, trust me, slugger.

03:12.059 --> 03:13.617
I got more.

03:16.831 --> 03:18.389
So much more.

03:19.834 --> 03:21.859
Where you goin', Old Yeller?

03:49.597 --> 03:52.191
Ennis! Where are we going?

03:52.400 --> 03:54.630
That place... it wasn't us.

03:59.473 --> 04:03.933
So, you drag me
to a ferry stop, why?

04:05.112 --> 04:06.602
We met on a ferry.

04:06.814 --> 04:09.248
That field trip?
Fifth grade?

04:09.417 --> 04:11.783
You had your hair in braids,
and...

04:13.221 --> 04:15.382
And I couldn't take my eyes off you.

04:16.357 --> 04:19.485
Tam, this is us.

04:19.927 --> 04:20.927
So...

04:21.095 --> 04:23.393
Oh, my God!

04:28.035 --> 04:29.525
Call 911!

04:29.737 --> 04:31.068
Call 911!

04:34.075 --> 04:35.667
David...

04:35.876 --> 04:36.968
I'm sorry.

04:37.178 --> 04:40.011
- David? Who's David?
- I didn't have a choice.

04:43.084 --> 04:45.382
Tamara! Tamara!

04:45.586 --> 04:46.610
No! Ah!

04:55.863 --> 04:58.024
No! No!

05:04.405 --> 05:05.804
No...

05:06.507 --> 05:07.599
Please...

05:08.909 --> 05:10.342
Please...

05:11.545 --> 05:12.739
No!

05:33.234 --> 05:35.361
Professor?
What are you doing here?

05:36.404 --> 05:37.598
Uh... My office.

05:37.805 --> 05:39.329
Why aren't you at lunch?

05:39.540 --> 05:41.405
Paperwork.

05:41.609 --> 05:43.338
I thought you and your wife
had gone away for the weekend.

05:43.544 --> 05:45.444
We have. We are.

05:45.646 --> 05:48.012
I just forgot something.

05:48.182 --> 05:50.173
Don't worry about it.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.675
Matt? It's David Lassiter.

06:22.283 --> 06:25.013
Spread the word.
I've got answers to the math final.

06:25.219 --> 06:26.982
Fifty bucks a pop.

06:34.595 --> 06:37.223
Teddy's House of PiÃ±atas,
Cinnamon speaking.

06:37.431 --> 06:38.989
Not funny, David.
Where the hell are you?

06:39.200 --> 06:41.200
- You need to come home.
- Margo. Margo. Slow down.

06:41.335 --> 06:42.859
David, listen to me.
You have to come home now.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.401
What do you mean?

06:44.605 --> 06:46.698
- It's about Sal.
- What about Sal?

06:47.541 --> 06:49.509
Our brother's dead.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.570
I know what I saw.

06:52.780 --> 06:54.475
And you're sure?

06:56.417 --> 06:59.181
I mean... sure?

06:59.387 --> 07:02.823
'Cause, what you're tellin' me,
about this faceless whatever-it-is?

07:03.023 --> 07:06.049
That thing had claws.

07:06.227 --> 07:07.387
Look, maybe you got confused.

07:07.595 --> 07:08.823
You know, maybe it was
some banger with a knife.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.709
- I know what I saw.
- I am trying to help.

07:10.898 --> 07:15.062
- By calling me a liar?
- Wow. You are just like your old man.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.800
Nate Ross was a great cop.

07:19.006 --> 07:20.303
Taught me everything I know.

07:20.508 --> 07:23.477
But his temper
never did him any favors.

07:23.677 --> 07:26.237
Look, you had a tough break,
losin' your dad as young as you did.

07:26.380 --> 07:29.247
And I have done all I can to help.
But if you go off half-cocked,

07:29.450 --> 07:31.577
spouting this monster crap
or doing something stupid,

07:31.786 --> 07:33.066
I can't help you anymore, Ennis.

07:33.254 --> 07:35.484
I know what I saw.

07:37.625 --> 07:40.389
Agents Bonham and Peart, FBI.
We will take it from here.

07:40.594 --> 07:41.686
Like hell you will.

07:41.896 --> 07:44.330
Since when did the feeb
start working stabbings?

07:44.532 --> 07:46.022
Listen, Detective...

07:47.601 --> 07:50.161
...your perp fits a certain profile.

07:50.371 --> 07:53.898
Now, I could go into detail,
but I'm not going to.

07:56.143 --> 07:59.840
All right.
Let's talk about last night.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.275
Why?

08:02.750 --> 08:04.240
So you can call me crazy, too?

08:04.452 --> 08:05.578
Try us.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.420
And when I got to her...

08:14.061 --> 08:16.621
...she...
She...

08:19.166 --> 08:21.532
There is nothing
you could've done.

08:22.536 --> 08:24.060
That supposed to
make me feel better?

08:25.940 --> 08:28.841
Look, this thing wasn't human.

08:30.377 --> 08:31.935
So what are you
gonna do about it?

08:34.114 --> 08:35.842
I don't know what to tell you, kid.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.211
There's no such thing
as monsters.

08:49.497 --> 08:50.725
Margo, calm down.

08:50.931 --> 08:52.831
Don't tell me
to calm down, Detective.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.092
Just tell me,
the ghouls, are they with us?

08:56.337 --> 08:57.895
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

09:01.642 --> 09:04.076
We don't pay you
for "maybe," Freddie.

09:04.278 --> 09:05.677
Cut to the chase.

09:05.880 --> 09:08.974
All right, well,
with your pop the way he is,

09:09.183 --> 09:13.142
and now that Sal's gone,
the families have concerns.

09:14.722 --> 09:19.182
Tell the ghouls, the Djinn,
and whoever, I run this family now.

09:19.994 --> 09:21.954
So they can either back us,
or I'll bend 'em over,

09:22.096 --> 09:24.690
jam a.45 elbow deep,
and empty the damn clip.

09:25.766 --> 09:28.098
Margo.

09:32.172 --> 09:33.901
You actually came.

09:35.609 --> 09:37.270
Welcome home, David.

09:38.312 --> 09:41.145
Hey, I'm sorry about Sal.
He was a... He was a good one.

09:41.348 --> 09:44.374
- What happened to him?
- Julian Duval happened.

09:45.219 --> 09:48.279
He and Sal had words
in the backroom of Il Secundo,

09:48.489 --> 09:51.390
then the wolf circled around
and tore that place apart.

09:51.592 --> 09:55.528
He clawed out Sal's heart,
and he will bleed for that.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.640
Maybe you can talk some sense
into her,

10:08.842 --> 10:10.639
'cause I sure as hell can't.

10:12.246 --> 10:13.770
Margo?

10:13.981 --> 10:16.609
What's with the NRA Christmas
in here?

10:16.784 --> 10:19.651
- What are you doing?
- We're going to war.

10:19.853 --> 10:22.117
You don't like it, talk to Dad.

10:27.027 --> 10:29.393
I didn't know Pop
was this bad.

10:33.200 --> 10:36.294
You've been gone three years.
Things change.

10:37.705 --> 10:40.435
Margo, are you sure it was Julian?

10:40.641 --> 10:43.405
- Costa's got a witness.
- That saw Julian?

10:43.611 --> 10:45.738
He hated Sal.

10:45.946 --> 10:48.210
You knew it, I knew it.
The whole damn city knew it.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.246
The dick saw his shot,
and he took it.

10:50.451 --> 10:53.147
- That's a "no."
- The mutt gutted our brother!

10:53.354 --> 10:55.049
You don't know that!

10:55.255 --> 10:57.985
- And if the werewolves did this...
- If? Look at you.

10:58.192 --> 11:00.888
Falling all over yourself
to defend the family

11:01.095 --> 11:04.394
that's had their foot
on our neck for years.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.433
It's just like old times.

11:12.706 --> 11:14.936
Oh, by the way...

11:16.243 --> 11:17.972
...your ex is getting married.

11:19.380 --> 11:21.610
You know that, right?
Violet?

11:21.815 --> 11:24.375
Her father pimped her out
to the New York wolves

11:24.585 --> 11:26.212
to seal some deal.

11:28.622 --> 11:30.590
I'm not saying don't fight.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.190
I'm saying be smart.

11:32.393 --> 11:33.985
Find out what happened.

11:35.696 --> 11:37.755
- And if Julian did this.
- Yeah, you'll what?

11:37.965 --> 11:41.696
David, come on.
You don't want this.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.736
You ran away to be a human.

11:47.141 --> 11:48.733
You always had a soft spot for 'em.

11:51.945 --> 11:54.413
Look, you're out.

11:54.581 --> 11:55.581
Stay out.

12:14.468 --> 12:16.368
You're sure
I can't get you anything?

12:16.570 --> 12:18.470
Bourbon? Blood?

12:19.506 --> 12:21.406
I'm fine.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.138
Do you really think
the shifters will make a move?

12:26.647 --> 12:29.207
Margo is not stupid.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.416
Julian.

12:32.619 --> 12:35.554
- Not now, Violet.
- We need to talk. Please.

12:40.627 --> 12:42.788
I just heard Sal Lassiter's dead.

12:42.996 --> 12:45.658
Oh, dear.
Whatever shall I do?

12:46.600 --> 12:49.660
- Did you kill him?
- No.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.997
From the look of his body,
Sal died quick.

12:52.206 --> 12:54.640
- Wait, you saw his body?
- I'm thorough, aren't I?

12:54.842 --> 12:56.400
- Then who killed him?
- Like I care.

12:56.610 --> 12:59.443
Why are you meeting
with the Djinn?

12:59.646 --> 13:03.047
Because that whore,
Margo Lassiter, wants me dead.

13:03.250 --> 13:04.650
She thinks I sliced up her brother,

13:04.785 --> 13:06.385
and I'm not gonna tell her
any different.

13:06.487 --> 13:08.648
After what those shifters have done,

13:08.856 --> 13:12.724
chipping away at our territory,
insulting us...

13:13.794 --> 13:14.852
There's a war coming.

13:15.062 --> 13:16.893
And I need Tattoos in there
on my side.

13:17.097 --> 13:19.725
- Wait, Julian, stop...
- What do you think you're doing?

13:19.933 --> 13:21.958
You're the bitch in this pack,
princess.

13:22.169 --> 13:25.696
Your job is to be pretty and silent.

13:25.906 --> 13:29.865
So war, no war...
you don't get a vote.

14:55.429 --> 14:57.624
No! No!

14:57.831 --> 14:59.264
Tamara!

16:18.946 --> 16:22.040
Chicago PD!
Stay right where you are!

16:22.249 --> 16:24.717
I don't think so.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.320
What the?

16:54.014 --> 16:55.413
He looks better with a little
off the top, don't you think?

16:56.984 --> 16:58.383
You want to run, now's the time.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.416
I'm not going anywhere

17:00.587 --> 17:02.953
until someone tells me
what the hell's going on.

17:04.891 --> 17:08.258
- You should go.
- No.

17:11.131 --> 17:13.463
All right, Sammy,
give him the talk.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.403
All right, look,
my name is Sam Winchester.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.334
That's my brother, Dean.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.905
We, uh...

17:22.776 --> 17:24.641
We kill vampires.

17:25.345 --> 17:27.643
And werewolves,
and demons, and...

17:27.848 --> 17:31.181
Basically, we chase down evil
and we cut its head off.

17:31.385 --> 17:34.752
So you're, what, monster cops?

17:35.355 --> 17:36.652
Hunters.

17:36.857 --> 17:38.381
Then what killed my girlfriend?

17:38.558 --> 17:40.958
We're working on it, okay?

17:41.128 --> 17:45.064
And from what you told us...
this thing sounds new.

17:45.232 --> 17:47.462
Or Freddy Krueger.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.794
What about that guy
I saw in the mirror,

17:50.003 --> 17:51.493
with... with the messed-up face?

17:51.705 --> 17:52.763
It's probably a wraith.

17:52.973 --> 17:54.907
Look, a lot of these things,
they can look human

17:55.108 --> 17:58.009
until you catch them in a mirror
or sometimes a camera.

17:58.211 --> 18:01.544
So, you find this...
this whatever, and you're...

18:01.748 --> 18:03.409
You're gonna chop its head off?

18:03.617 --> 18:07.713
Yeah, or sometimes,
when in doubt, try a silver bullet.

18:07.921 --> 18:10.253
- Hey, Sammy.
- Yep?

18:10.457 --> 18:12.721
This is full of blood and meat.

18:12.926 --> 18:15.417
A lot of meat.
Actually, this one...

18:16.530 --> 18:18.862
This one's labeled "Susan."

18:21.435 --> 18:23.164
What is this,
some kind of backroom...

18:23.370 --> 18:24.394
Monster VIP.

18:24.604 --> 18:27.971
Yeah, well, if it is,
and Sal Lassiter was here...

18:28.175 --> 18:29.199
Then he's not human.

18:29.409 --> 18:31.741
So, what, we got monsters
killing monsters now?

18:31.945 --> 18:32.969
Maybe.

18:33.180 --> 18:34.772
- We got to see the body.
- I'm coming with you.

18:34.981 --> 18:37.973
- No. You're gonna stay.
- Or what? Huh?

18:38.185 --> 18:39.584
You gonna hurt me?

18:39.786 --> 18:41.344
Kill the girl I love?

18:41.555 --> 18:44.183
Ruin my damn life?

18:44.391 --> 18:45.915
Yeah, you're too late.

18:46.126 --> 18:48.219
Ennis, listen. I get it.

18:48.428 --> 18:50.055
Believe me, I've been there.

18:50.263 --> 18:52.731
But what we do, it's messed up.

18:52.933 --> 18:55.128
So do yourself a favor
and stay out.

18:55.335 --> 18:57.098
You can get hurt, too.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.569
Okay.

19:29.269 --> 19:32.136
- Hey. Can we talk?
- About what?

19:32.339 --> 19:34.204
Last night.

19:34.341 --> 19:37.538
This thing you think killed Tamara,
what'd it look like?

19:37.744 --> 19:38.904
Thing?

19:40.147 --> 19:41.978
You said it was
"some banger with a knife."

19:42.182 --> 19:44.207
Chasing down every lead, kid.

19:53.793 --> 19:57.024
Like I told you,
it didn't have much of a face.

19:57.931 --> 20:01.332
He... it... whatever, say anything?

20:01.535 --> 20:04.333
- I told you that, too.
- Then tell me again.

20:06.439 --> 20:08.805
Hey, if you got the time,
why don't you hang around?

20:08.975 --> 20:11.842
Dad's working the graveyard,
but he'll be home soon.

20:12.045 --> 20:14.104
And he'd love to see you.

20:15.348 --> 20:17.976
Sure. Be good to see him, too.

20:20.120 --> 20:22.350
Sorry. Text.

20:26.560 --> 20:28.118
No worries.

20:30.263 --> 20:34.097
Look, Ennis, I...
I know this is hard.

20:34.301 --> 20:36.963
See... that thing slashed up
my jacket pretty good.

20:37.170 --> 20:39.764
Forensics went over it, but...
Well, you want to see?

20:41.007 --> 20:42.531
That'd be great.

20:52.152 --> 20:53.744
I appreciate this, kid.

20:54.487 --> 20:55.784
Really.

20:58.091 --> 20:59.217
Hey.

20:59.826 --> 21:01.487
Look, there's a silver bullet
in this gun!

21:01.695 --> 21:03.720
Ennis. Ennis, don't.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.398
You're not Freddie Costa,
so who are you?

21:07.601 --> 21:10.729
My name is David Lassiter.
I'm a shapeshifter.

21:12.906 --> 21:15.568
- You're a what?!
- We shift our shape.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.572
It's kinda all there in the name.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.005
Sal Lassiter was my brother.

21:20.213 --> 21:21.510
I'm just trying to find out
who killed him.

21:21.715 --> 21:23.580
So you slap on
somebody else's face, huh?

21:23.783 --> 21:25.944
It's kind of my go-to.

21:26.086 --> 21:29.146
Look, I read the police report.
I know you lost someone, too.

21:29.322 --> 21:31.415
Shut up!
See, you don't talk about her!

21:38.265 --> 21:40.597
You know what's going on
out there?

21:41.935 --> 21:43.368
Do you have any idea?

21:43.570 --> 21:46.471
Freaks. Hunters.
Yeah, I got the basics.

21:48.908 --> 21:50.341
Wow.

21:50.577 --> 21:52.238
You are so in over your head.

21:53.346 --> 21:54.745
Let me give you the short version.

21:54.948 --> 21:58.714
Chicago is divided up
between five monster families.

21:58.918 --> 22:01.887
- What? Is that a joke?
- Do you hear a laugh track?

22:02.088 --> 22:05.421
- What about the police?
- We own the police.

22:05.592 --> 22:08.390
Look, I'm talking shakedowns,
organ trafficking.

22:08.595 --> 22:10.153
The werewolves
run the Gold Coast,

22:10.363 --> 22:12.092
the Djinn owning the South Side.

22:14.200 --> 22:18.398
But we want to keep a low
profile, so... we keep the peace.

22:18.605 --> 22:20.698
And human casualties
to a minimum.

22:20.907 --> 22:23.375
- A minimum?
- Look, I don't like it either, okay?

22:23.576 --> 22:25.544
But you know
what's behind door number two?

22:25.745 --> 22:27.076
War.

22:28.415 --> 22:31.441
That's blood,
human and monster, in the street.

22:32.652 --> 22:34.347
And right now?

22:34.554 --> 22:36.681
There's exactly one guy
trying to stop it.

22:37.324 --> 22:38.586
Wow.

22:38.758 --> 22:40.749
You know, good for you.

22:40.960 --> 22:43.554
I'd slow clap, but, well,
my hands are a little full.

22:46.599 --> 22:49.067
Just stay out of it, okay?

22:53.473 --> 22:57.068
These cuts
are flecked with silver.

22:57.243 --> 22:58.243
How do you know?

22:58.411 --> 23:00.572
- Because it burns.
- So?

23:00.780 --> 23:02.714
Julian Duval hasn't got silver claws.

23:02.916 --> 23:04.315
He's a werewolf.

23:08.388 --> 23:10.686
Hey! Hey!

23:47.060 --> 23:49.551
So, get this.

23:49.729 --> 23:54.996
The... coroner says this guy,
this... Julian Duval,

23:55.201 --> 23:59.160
shows up, drops three grand
to see Sal's corpse.

23:59.372 --> 24:01.135
And he lives in a friggin' castle.

24:01.341 --> 24:03.673
- Who is this guy?
- Well, if we're lucky,

24:03.877 --> 24:06.243
someone who knows what happened
in that monster bar.

24:12.051 --> 24:13.051
Madame.

24:16.456 --> 24:18.947
You can cut the act, David.

24:20.593 --> 24:22.584
- How did you...
- I know you.

24:24.097 --> 24:26.725
Yeah, well, ditto.

24:31.504 --> 24:33.028
Is the real butler okay?

24:34.574 --> 24:36.064
He's resting.

24:37.110 --> 24:39.840
- Locked in a closet.
- You shouldn't be here.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.177
You think I want to be here?

24:44.818 --> 24:46.012
It's about Sal.

24:48.988 --> 24:50.512
I heard. I'm so sorry.

24:51.558 --> 24:53.355
- Julian didn't do it.
- Yeah, I know.

24:53.560 --> 24:54.891
That's why I need you
to talk your brother,

24:55.094 --> 24:56.118
get him to a have a sit-down
with Margo,

24:56.329 --> 24:57.455
so they can just work
this crap out.

24:57.664 --> 25:00.292
- There's no way that's happening.
- We can stop a war, Violet.

25:00.500 --> 25:02.991
One, Julian doesn't want
to stop this, and second, how?

25:04.571 --> 25:07.005
You're a runaway and I'm...

25:07.173 --> 25:09.073
I'm a bitch. We don't matter.

25:10.944 --> 25:12.275
What's wrong with you?

25:12.479 --> 25:14.140
Since when
do you play their game?

25:14.347 --> 25:16.406
And since when do you let your dad
sell you to some dick from New York?

25:16.616 --> 25:18.948
- You think I had a choice?!
- You did!

25:20.119 --> 25:23.350
Union Station. Midnight.
You had a choice.

25:25.925 --> 25:27.222
You...

25:28.328 --> 25:31.058
You're the one
who said we should go away,

25:31.264 --> 25:33.061
live a normal life.

25:34.501 --> 25:36.765
You set the time, the place...

25:39.038 --> 25:41.199
...and I was there.

25:44.344 --> 25:46.244
Where were you?

25:50.416 --> 25:52.509
Run!

26:25.752 --> 26:27.811
Violet! Violet!

26:38.631 --> 26:39.893
- What the hell's going on?
- It took her.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.794
- Wait, who are you?
- His name's David Lassiter.

26:42.001 --> 26:43.866
He's a shapeshifter.

26:44.070 --> 26:46.436
We got to go. Now! Let's go!

26:56.149 --> 26:57.946
All right, everybody out.

27:01.387 --> 27:05.949
So you're tellin' me
there are five monster families

27:06.159 --> 27:07.820
that run Chicago?

27:08.027 --> 27:10.120
What is this,
The Godfather with fangs?

27:10.330 --> 27:12.821
Well, if it is, I'm gonna need
all the help I can get.

27:13.032 --> 27:15.091
Well, he doesn't quit.
I'll give him that.

27:15.301 --> 27:16.393
Violet's not picking up.

27:16.569 --> 27:18.503
Wait, so this girl,
she's a shifter, too?

27:18.738 --> 27:19.762
Werewolf.

27:19.973 --> 27:21.600
Awesome.

27:23.977 --> 27:26.707
If she has her cell,
we could trace the signal.

27:26.913 --> 27:28.744
Yeah, you might be right.

27:28.948 --> 27:30.068
All right.
What's her number?

27:30.149 --> 27:31.343
Take me with you,
and it's all yours.

27:31.551 --> 27:32.916
No!

27:34.554 --> 27:36.021
Oh, hell no!

27:36.222 --> 27:38.019
Dude, he's a freakin' Transformer.

27:38.224 --> 27:40.590
And sometimes you
got to work with the bad guys

27:40.793 --> 27:42.124
to get to the worse guys.

27:42.328 --> 27:44.455
Dude, I'm right here.

27:44.664 --> 27:46.222
Yeah, I see you.

28:25.938 --> 28:28.702
You think I'm some freak...

28:29.909 --> 28:31.467
...like you.

28:36.749 --> 28:38.478
But I'm not.

28:52.865 --> 28:54.389
I'm just a man...

28:55.968 --> 29:00.166
...with some fun... little toys.

29:20.026 --> 29:21.857
Signal's coming from in there.

29:25.898 --> 29:27.695
Hey.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.925
Thanks for... you know.

29:31.070 --> 29:32.059
And about your girlfriend, I'm...

29:32.271 --> 29:33.329
Look, I don't need
no apology from you.

29:33.539 --> 29:35.530
I lost someone, too, okay?

29:36.509 --> 29:38.306
But I'm trying here.

29:42.014 --> 29:43.982
I'm sorry about your brother.

29:46.452 --> 29:48.750
He spoke about you at the end.

29:49.822 --> 29:53.724
He said, "David, I'm sorry.
I didn't have a choice."

29:55.428 --> 29:56.622
All right, you guys
can kiss and make up later.

29:56.829 --> 29:57.909
We got work to do. Come on.

30:00.566 --> 30:02.158
Silver.

30:03.870 --> 30:07.067
It burns if you're evil.

30:08.441 --> 30:10.102
If you're a monster.

30:14.147 --> 30:15.739
No! No!

30:15.948 --> 30:17.279
Look at him!

30:20.286 --> 30:21.810
He was my son.

30:22.822 --> 30:26.622
And your brother
and the shifter, Lassiter...

30:27.593 --> 30:29.356
They ripped him apart.

30:35.101 --> 30:36.898
The police told me
that it was a wild animal.

30:38.371 --> 30:41.033
And I believed them for years.

30:41.908 --> 30:44.103
But now I know the truth.

30:45.578 --> 30:47.443
Please, Sal and Julian
hated each other,

30:47.647 --> 30:48.614
and neither of them
would hurt a kid.

30:48.815 --> 30:51.181
Why should I believe you?
You're dead.

30:51.384 --> 30:56.151
Tomorrow, they will find
pieces of you all over town.

30:59.292 --> 31:02.625
Oh, won't the doggies be mad?

31:03.696 --> 31:06.824
That's what you want.

31:06.933 --> 31:08.264
You're trying to start a war.

31:09.035 --> 31:12.163
When freaks start killin' freaks,
we win.

31:12.371 --> 31:13.633
No.

31:13.840 --> 31:17.503
Once this starts, do you
have any idea how many people...

31:17.710 --> 31:20.008
how many children will die?

31:40.266 --> 31:42.097
All right, you're with me, Romeo.

31:42.768 --> 31:44.201
Sounds good, Buffy.

32:46.899 --> 32:48.093
David?

32:49.936 --> 32:51.130
David?

32:55.808 --> 32:57.673
I'm so sorry, Violet.

33:06.319 --> 33:08.844
Guess I'm gonna have to make
an example of you, too.

33:09.055 --> 33:10.716
- No!
- Don't hurt her!

33:10.923 --> 33:12.151
Why?!

33:13.092 --> 33:14.092
Hm?

33:16.295 --> 33:18.490
'Cause she's your girlfriend?

33:18.664 --> 33:20.325
Yeah, I heard you talking.

33:20.533 --> 33:22.694
Real sweet.
Hell, it was almost human.

33:25.071 --> 33:26.698
Almost.

33:35.948 --> 33:37.916
Here's the thing.

33:38.117 --> 33:41.143
You can look human
and act human...

33:42.488 --> 33:45.355
...but deep down?
You're just a monster.

33:57.203 --> 33:58.966
Violet, no! Please!

34:00.039 --> 34:02.200
Please! Violet.

34:04.110 --> 34:05.600
Please.

34:12.150 --> 34:14.380
It's all right.
It's all right.

34:24.630 --> 34:25.927
What'd we miss?

34:28.934 --> 34:30.400
I know you.

34:31.971 --> 34:33.632
I'm sorry about your girl.

34:37.275 --> 34:39.266
But she was in the way.

34:40.846 --> 34:43.871
You understand.
I know you do.

34:45.016 --> 34:46.848
They're monsters!

34:50.989 --> 34:52.786
I only see one monster here.

35:13.979 --> 35:17.540
- You all right?
- I will be.

35:17.750 --> 35:21.447
- Are you?
- I'll get back to you on that.

35:23.289 --> 35:26.224
Sal... he said he was sorry.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.761
Those were his last words.

35:29.962 --> 35:33.523
"David, I'm sorry.
I didn't have a choice."

35:34.867 --> 35:36.596
But Sal never
did anything to me.

35:37.870 --> 35:39.633
Why would he say that?

35:49.515 --> 35:51.574
Sal, what are you do...

35:54.520 --> 35:55.953
He's not coming, is he?

35:56.155 --> 35:58.146
David'll be here in a few minutes.

35:58.357 --> 35:59.551
You won't be.

36:01.193 --> 36:02.751
Why are you doing this?

36:02.962 --> 36:04.862
'Cause he's
my little brother, Violet.

36:05.064 --> 36:06.588
It's my job to protect him.

36:06.799 --> 36:08.562
It's my job
to keep our blood pure.

36:08.767 --> 36:10.928
You believe that bloodline crap?

36:11.137 --> 36:12.502
We all do.

36:12.705 --> 36:14.764
Bloodlines...
everyone knowing our place.

36:14.974 --> 36:16.839
It's the one thing
we all agree on.

36:17.042 --> 36:19.806
If your people find out
you ran off with a shifter,

36:20.012 --> 36:22.242
they'll be lookin' for payback.

36:22.448 --> 36:24.973
And they'll come after my family.

36:25.117 --> 36:28.553
And then it's nothin' but bad times
and dead bodies on both sides.

36:28.754 --> 36:31.120
David wants to go straight,
that's his call.

36:31.323 --> 36:34.383
But he does it alone.

36:34.527 --> 36:36.518
So you have a choice, Violet.

36:36.729 --> 36:39.391
You could either
walk out of here alive...

36:42.835 --> 36:46.498
...or I'll take you out and dump
what's left of you in the lake.

36:49.742 --> 36:51.004
Sal?

36:52.178 --> 36:53.702
I love him.

36:54.713 --> 36:56.510
I wish that mattered.

37:05.024 --> 37:08.152
Even after I left the family,
I knew if things got bad,

37:08.360 --> 37:10.954
that Sal would always have my back.

37:13.499 --> 37:14.898
So...

37:16.869 --> 37:18.234
What did he mean?

37:20.539 --> 37:22.131
I don't know.

37:22.341 --> 37:23.706
I should go.

37:23.909 --> 37:27.777
Sure. Right.
That's what you do best.

37:31.483 --> 37:33.007
David...

38:02.181 --> 38:03.512
Pop?

38:08.320 --> 38:09.685
What?

38:09.888 --> 38:13.255
Your sister.
She wants war.

38:14.226 --> 38:16.057
You have to stop her.

38:23.269 --> 38:27.296
All this was some...
messed-up guy.

38:27.473 --> 38:28.701
The Duvals are clean.

38:29.508 --> 38:31.032
Fine. We done?

38:31.243 --> 38:33.177
And I'm coming back
to the family.

38:33.979 --> 38:35.173
I thought you were out.

38:35.381 --> 38:37.474
Well, now I'm back in.

38:46.091 --> 38:48.685
I've waited a long time
to hear you say that.

39:01.407 --> 39:02.999
Welcome home, David.

39:31.370 --> 39:32.462
You live here alone?

39:32.671 --> 39:34.298
My sister's
on the other side of town,

39:34.506 --> 39:36.146
my mom's out of the picture,
and my dad...

39:36.308 --> 39:37.707
Well, he died.

39:37.910 --> 39:39.810
Line of duty.
A long time ago.

39:40.012 --> 39:41.946
I'm sorry to hear that.

39:42.114 --> 39:43.114
Yeah?

39:43.215 --> 39:45.342
- So, what's next?
- Nothing, you're done.

39:45.551 --> 39:46.916
Okay.

39:48.187 --> 39:49.814
We're on our way. Yeah.

39:51.256 --> 39:54.191
Just give me a second.

39:57.529 --> 39:59.224
- Yeah?
- We've got a gig.

39:59.431 --> 40:01.058
You want to leave?

40:01.266 --> 40:02.906
Dean, this city
is crawling with monsters.

40:03.001 --> 40:04.491
Cass has a line on Metatron.

40:04.703 --> 40:06.534
This is what
we've been waiting for.

40:06.739 --> 40:08.036
This is our shot, Sam.

40:09.842 --> 40:12.367
You're going?

40:12.544 --> 40:15.513
Look, weâll... We'll call in
some other hunters, some pros,

40:15.714 --> 40:17.705
and download them on the monster
mob situation, all of it.

40:17.916 --> 40:21.044
- Look, guys, I could...
- Ennis, seriously. Don't.

40:21.253 --> 40:24.654
You get into this too deep,
there's no getting out.

40:44.410 --> 40:45.900
But I couldn't walk away.

40:46.011 --> 40:47.535
This is my fight now.

40:47.679 --> 40:51.843
Hell, it's a damn war,
and I got to start somewhere.

41:23.415 --> 41:26.111
- Hello?
- What are you doing?

41:26.318 --> 41:27.546
Who is this?

41:27.753 --> 41:29.983
If you start hunting,
the monsters will kill you.

41:30.189 --> 41:31.622
Dad?

41:34.393 --> 41:36.054
Dad?
