Previously on Bates Motel...

00:03.160 --> 00:04.446
Bradley, we need to talk.

00:04.520 --> 00:05.965
You and I,
we're together, right?

00:06.160 --> 00:08.766
Norman, I don't
feel that way about you.

00:09.320 --> 00:10.890
He came at me
with a meat tenderizer.

00:11.920 --> 00:13.081
You're making
this up, right?

00:13.960 --> 00:17.009
Can I help you?
Jake Abernathy.

00:17.120 --> 00:18.804
You know where I can
find Keith Summers?

00:19.120 --> 00:20.451
He's actually dead.

00:20.640 --> 00:22.449
Where is it?
Where is what?

00:22.720 --> 00:25.451
I'm not some moron
like Keith Summers.

00:25.520 --> 00:27.329
He was the bottom rung.
I'm on the top.

00:28.280 --> 00:31.170
Here's your money back.
I want you out of my motel!

00:31.240 --> 00:34.244
You want to play,
we'll play.

I wonder who died.

01:06.240 --> 01:09.130
NORMA: (SIGHS) I was changing
to go out to dinner,

01:09.200 --> 01:12.329
walked in my room, I opened the
door, turned on the light.

01:12.960 --> 01:15.531
Just, there it was
in my bed.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.328
God, the image. (SOBS)

01:19.320 --> 01:22.767
Oh, the smell is
nevergonnaleave my brain.

01:22.840 --> 01:24.410
Do you have any idea
who might have done it?

01:25.320 --> 01:27.084
I have a pretty good idea
who might have done this.

01:27.160 --> 01:29.322
It was that man,
Jake Abernathy,

01:29.440 --> 01:30.487
who stayed at the motel.

01:30.560 --> 01:31.686
What makes you say that?

01:32.440 --> 01:34.329
'Cause he was asking
all sorts of weird questions

01:34.400 --> 01:36.402
about Shelby,
about Keith Summers.

01:36.520 --> 01:40.127
Like what? Like... Like
how well I knew them.

01:40.200 --> 01:42.123
Like what I knew about
what happened to them.

01:42.960 --> 01:44.610
He was asking me
if I had something,

01:44.680 --> 01:46.205
something that he
was looking for that

01:46.280 --> 01:47.441
he was supposed
to get from Shelby.

01:48.040 --> 01:49.121
What was that?

01:50.200 --> 01:52.248
I don't know.
I thought he was crazy!

01:54.080 --> 01:57.607
Like, why do crazy people
keep gravitating towards me?

02:02.040 --> 02:03.963
You get this guy's information
when he checked in?

02:04.520 --> 02:07.046
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.
It's down in the office.

02:08.199 --> 02:09.326
We can go get it.

NORMAN: Would you want to sleep on a
mattress a dead body had been on?

02:24.240 --> 02:25.480
DYLAN:
That's what Lysol's for.

02:26.560 --> 02:28.164
What do you think
they do in hospitals?

02:28.840 --> 02:31.081
Do you think they burn the
mattress every time somebody dies?

02:31.160 --> 02:33.845
Just cut her some slack.
It was pretty horrible.

02:33.920 --> 02:35.365
Yeah, it was.

02:36.080 --> 02:38.003
And that's why she'll make
a meal out of it for a year.

02:41.560 --> 02:42.971
You know I can
hear you, right?

02:46.200 --> 02:48.123
And I'm not making
a meal out of it.

02:48.200 --> 02:49.929
It was completely horrific.

Do you smell that?

03:02.240 --> 03:03.571
(LAUGHTER)

03:05.720 --> 03:10.487
Excuse me. You can't smoke
pot on my motel porch, okay?

03:10.560 --> 03:13.962
(LAUGHING)
You're kidding, right?

03:14.040 --> 03:15.530
No, I'm not even
close to kidding.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.284
You know
where you live, right?

03:17.960 --> 03:20.247
What the local economy
is around here?

03:21.120 --> 03:23.407
GIRL: No one cares.
I care.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.367
Okay? I care.
Mom, it's okay.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.568
No, it's not okay. This
is not happening here.

03:31.960 --> 03:36.443
Lady, I get that you're
upset 'cause someone died.

03:36.520 --> 03:37.965
Give me that!

03:39.080 --> 03:40.491
RA'UFI Whoa! Whoa!

03:42.040 --> 03:43.451
You, what's your name?

03:43.960 --> 03:45.007
Ra'uf.

03:45.400 --> 03:46.561
Ra'uf?

03:48.600 --> 03:55.051
Ra'uf, I had an idea when I moved
here of how life was gonna be.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.402
Oh, okay, sure, while life
can be disappointing,

03:59.480 --> 04:03.371
no one prepared me for the colossal
fricking face-dive off a cliff

04:03.440 --> 04:05.886
that living in this
crazy-ass town really is.

04:06.440 --> 04:11.651
However, my idea of what happens on my
property is still under my control,

04:11.720 --> 04:14.087
and it does not include
people in torn jeans

04:14.160 --> 04:15.764
with tie-dyed clothing
and dirty hair

04:15.840 --> 04:18.127
hanging out on my new
furniture smoking a doobie.

04:18.360 --> 04:20.202
So take that as the law
around here because

04:20.320 --> 04:22.322
there doesn't seem to be
much of one otherwise, okay?

04:22.520 --> 04:26.320
All right.
Okay, just chill.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.161
Chill your own ass.

(SIGHS)

04:39.000 --> 04:41.890
I mean, what kind of people are
these that you brought here?

04:41.960 --> 04:43.086
They're workers.

04:43.320 --> 04:44.401
Doing what?

04:45.480 --> 04:47.369
Just processing stuff.

04:47.440 --> 04:48.680
Processing what stuff?

04:49.600 --> 04:50.761
Stuff.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.721
I hate this place!
I hate it! I hate it.

05:04.800 --> 05:05.847
Coming here was
the worst mistake.

05:05.920 --> 05:08.446
A horrible mistake.
This town is a nightmare.

05:08.680 --> 05:09.761
I can't wait to get
the hell out.

05:09.840 --> 05:11.285
It can't happen soon enough.

05:11.680 --> 05:12.841

what does that mean?

What are you doing
here so early?

06:47.120 --> 06:49.566
Oh, hey, I just came in a bit
before school to work on this.

06:49.640 --> 06:51.244
I know how you wanted
it all organized.

06:51.320 --> 06:53.641
It's just taking a bit
longer than I'd hoped.

06:53.720 --> 06:54.926
The guy who owned
this place before you

06:55.000 --> 06:56.206
was not much
of a file keeper.

06:56.280 --> 06:58.123
Ugh, just throw
it all away.

06:59.280 --> 07:00.566
Didn't you want me
to organize it?

07:00.640 --> 07:01.766
Not anymore.

07:01.840 --> 07:04.889
Just keep anything that relates to the
original deeds and the sale of the land.

07:04.960 --> 07:06.883
Everything else,
just trash it.

07:08.400 --> 07:09.606
Is everything
all right?

07:10.600 --> 07:11.886
Everything's fine.

07:14.040 --> 07:15.530
I have some
errands to run.

07:19.200 --> 07:23.444
Oh, and these people that
are staying at the motel,

07:24.040 --> 07:26.008
under no circumstances
are any of the guests

07:26.080 --> 07:28.128
allowed to smoke pot
in or around the motel.

07:28.440 --> 07:31.523
If they do, you have to go out
there and bust it up immediately.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.370
Bust it up? (LAUGHS)

07:34.480 --> 07:35.606
That's right.
Make them stop.

07:38.440 --> 07:39.851
What if they
don't want to?

07:39.920 --> 07:42.207
Well, you have to find an
authoritative voice with them.

07:42.960 --> 07:44.086
See you in a bit.

it's Jake Abernathy.

something about this.

Just tell him
to call me!

I figured.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.286
Yeah.

ask you something.

09:32.560 --> 09:33.800
Sure.

Did you know my dad has an
office over at Gil's place?

09:37.920 --> 09:39.809
No. No, I didn't.

09:40.760 --> 09:43.730
Well, I was wondering if you
could do me a really big favor

09:43.800 --> 09:44.847
and get me inside.

09:46.280 --> 09:48.123
I just want to get
some of his stuff.

09:49.880 --> 09:52.804
I know I barely know you
and it's a lot to ask,

09:53.680 --> 09:57.526
but somehow it seemed like it
would be okay to ask you anyway.

09:58.400 --> 09:59.401

10:01.520 --> 10:04.490
Yeah. Yeah,
I'll check it out.

I really appreciate it.

high school now.

10:14.560 --> 10:15.766

I've got a client here.

10:36.880 --> 10:39.247
Can I call you
back later? Thanks.

10:40.040 --> 10:43.487
Norma Bates. How's the
motel business going?

10:43.560 --> 10:45.483
Motel business sucks, Matt.

10:45.920 --> 10:47.331
Is there a problem?

10:47.400 --> 10:48.367
When I bought
the property,

10:48.440 --> 10:50.090
you never told me there was
gonna be a new bypass road

10:50.320 --> 10:51.651
that takes
all the traffic

10:51.720 --> 10:54.246
away from my property
and destroys my business.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.482
At the time,
it wasn't official.

10:56.560 --> 10:57.971
It was being proposed.

10:58.360 --> 11:00.761
(CHUCKLES) Lots of
things are proposed.

11:00.840 --> 11:02.126
Matt, listen to me, you
want to spend the next year

11:02.200 --> 11:03.725

in court?

11:04.920 --> 11:06.763
Ideally, no.

11:06.840 --> 11:08.251
Then get me
my money back.

11:08.520 --> 11:11.444
I want the motel and the house
on the market as of today,

11:11.960 --> 11:14.042
and I want an open house on Sunday.
Can you do that?

11:14.120 --> 11:16.771
All right. Okay, yes.
I'll relist it.

11:16.960 --> 11:18.325

out in the front.

Juno.

14:45.960 --> 14:47.689
She's the dog
that got hit out front.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.170
That's just weird, dude.

14:52.960 --> 14:53.961
Close the door.

15:01.120 --> 15:03.088
Has Mom said anything
else to you about moving?

15:03.280 --> 15:07.649
No, but I've been
at work all day.

15:09.640 --> 15:11.768
Did you have a dream you
were drowning someone?

15:13.280 --> 15:15.931
Yeah. No, it says here
drowning in a dream

15:16.000 --> 15:17.923
can mean you're feeling
overwhelmed in your life.

15:18.640 --> 15:19.880
That makes sense.

15:20.160 --> 15:21.241
Yeah.

15:23.240 --> 15:28.644
Just curious, who were you
drowning in the dream?

15:32.040 --> 15:33.371
Someone from school.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.806
Yeah, I figured.

15:37.040 --> 15:38.326
But who was it?

15:42.840 --> 15:44.285
It's stupid. (CHUCKLES)

15:45.880 --> 15:47.530
No, it's totally stupid.

15:49.520 --> 15:50.521
But who was it?

15:50.800 --> 15:52.040
Bradley.

15:56.360 --> 15:57.885
It's just a dream, Dylan.

16:00.200 --> 16:02.567
You wouldn't actually want to
hurt anybody, though, would you?

16:03.560 --> 16:05.130
Of course
I wouldn't want to.

16:05.200 --> 16:06.645
I've never wanted
to hurt anyone,

16:09.040 --> 16:10.565
except you
once in a while.

16:17.520 --> 16:18.681
Good night, Norman.

16:26.080 --> 16:27.320
(MUSIC PLAYING)

16:55.200 --> 16:57.202
GIL: We got two more truckloads
coming in from the north field,

16:57.280 --> 16:58.441
and that'll be it.

16:58.840 --> 17:01.571
Hey, Gil, can I ask you something?
Sure.

17:01.640 --> 17:03.130
Did Jerry Martin
have an office here?

17:03.760 --> 17:06.763
What, I haven't promoted you fast enough?
You want an office now too?

17:07.200 --> 17:09.009
No. No,
I was just curious.

17:09.079 --> 17:11.048
I'm not feeling too friendly
towards Jerry Martin.

17:11.599 --> 17:13.602
His little shenanigans
cost me over 100 grand

17:13.720 --> 17:15.768
of lost product
in that warehouse fire.

17:16.359 --> 17:18.282
He's lucky I didn't get his
family to cover my losses.

17:19.280 --> 17:21.442
Yeah, no, I get it.

17:23.359 --> 17:24.964
You want his office,
take it.

17:25.040 --> 17:27.247
Just throw
all his shit out.

17:48.160 --> 17:49.491
(SNIFFING)

18:06.880 --> 18:08.041
DANNY: (COUGHS) Yeah.

18:08.120 --> 18:09.326
Excuse me.
I'm from the motel.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.684
I'm kind of
busy right now.

18:12.480 --> 18:13.766
Could you open
the door, please?

18:13.840 --> 18:15.205
(CLEARS THROAT)

18:17.440 --> 18:18.441
Hey, what's up?

18:18.640 --> 18:20.483
It smells like someone
is smoking weed,

18:20.560 --> 18:23.086
and no one is supposed to
be doing that at the motel.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.361
Well, it's not me.

18:26.680 --> 18:28.921
I can see smoke
behind your back,

18:29.000 --> 18:30.570
so unless you're on fire,

18:30.640 --> 18:32.369
I think you are
smoking something.

18:32.680 --> 18:33.920
(SIGHS)

18:35.560 --> 18:36.607
You want some?

18:37.480 --> 18:39.960
No, I don't want some.
You want me to blow up?

18:40.040 --> 18:41.087
Oh, you won't blow up.

18:41.160 --> 18:44.164
I've seen smokers with O2
tanks in Vegas, you know,

18:44.240 --> 18:45.321
playing the
slot machines.

18:45.400 --> 18:47.209
Yeah, that's not
really the point.

18:47.600 --> 18:49.284
Okay, well,
if you can't smoke,

18:49.360 --> 18:52.011
I've got these killer
weed cupcakes.

18:52.080 --> 18:53.127
Do you want one?

18:53.200 --> 18:55.043
No, thanks.

18:55.120 --> 18:58.010
Just put the joint out, or
I'm gonna lose my job, okay?

18:58.440 --> 18:59.441
Okay-

19:02.400 --> 19:04.289
Thanks.
I appreciate it.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.806
So this sentence here.

19:19.440 --> 19:23.001
"He felt like he was choking
inside on some black smoke."

19:24.640 --> 19:26.085
That, I love.
I love that image,

19:26.920 --> 19:28.604
but I think it would be
better if you just moved it

19:28.680 --> 19:29.920
to the end
of the paragraph.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.286
Yeah.
See?

19:36.000 --> 19:37.286
It just has
more impact.

19:39.080 --> 19:40.445
Yeah, I see that.
Yeah.

19:41.760 --> 19:44.366
How did you ever come
up with this idea, hmm?

19:44.560 --> 19:46.528
A man who's on fire
on the inside.

19:47.600 --> 19:48.601
I don't know.

19:50.120 --> 19:51.884
No, I honestly don't know.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.731
I just figured it would
make an interesting story.

19:55.320 --> 19:58.164
You know, how do you deal
with daily life when you're

19:59.000 --> 20:01.207
burning up and nothing
will put it out?

20:03.120 --> 20:04.929
I think you're an
old soul, Norman.

20:07.760 --> 20:12.561
I just feel like you understand things
that are way beyond your years,

20:13.080 --> 20:14.889
things about
how hard life can be,

20:15.960 --> 20:17.928
about how we're not really
meant to be happy.

20:24.480 --> 20:25.845
Miss Watson,
are you okay?

20:25.920 --> 20:29.447
Hmm? Yeah.
I am. Of course.

20:30.160 --> 20:31.889
I'm just a sap
for good writing.

20:32.320 --> 20:33.321
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

20:36.880 --> 20:38.325
Anyway, you should,
um, you should probably

20:38.400 --> 20:39.640
make sure that this
is okay with your mom

20:39.720 --> 20:41.051
if it should be
published.

20:41.120 --> 20:42.804
You know, being as
you're a minor and all.

20:43.400 --> 20:45.687
Yeah, I'll tell her. Okay.

20:48.160 --> 20:49.161
(MAN SINGING)

21:33.640 --> 21:34.880
Where are you
guys working?

21:35.160 --> 21:38.209
Gil's dry dock.
Want some veggies?

21:40.880 --> 21:42.245
No, I'm good. Thanks.

21:56.360 --> 21:57.566
Did you get
my message?

21:58.320 --> 22:00.288
Something about
flowers.

22:00.360 --> 22:02.727
Yeah, I saved the card.
Here it is.

22:09.040 --> 22:10.246
How do you know
he sent this?

22:10.560 --> 22:12.005
Well, who else
would it be?

22:12.080 --> 22:14.526
I don't know. I don't know
anything about your personal life.

22:15.080 --> 22:18.448
This doesn't have anything to do with
my personal life. This could be a clue.

22:18.880 --> 22:22.601
And I'm pretty sure that I saw
him driving by earlier today.

22:25.720 --> 22:26.846
I'll look into the florist.

22:26.920 --> 22:28.046
I don't think
it'll lead anywhere.

22:28.120 --> 22:30.600
Why not? 'Cause Jake
Abernathy doesn't exist.

22:30.680 --> 22:33.411
All the information he gave you
when he registered is made up.

22:33.480 --> 22:35.050
And if this was him,

22:35.120 --> 22:38.044
I doubt he left any traceable
information at the florist. So...

22:38.600 --> 22:41.763
I'd like to dust his motel room for
fingerprints if you'll let me in.

22:41.880 --> 22:43.530
Well, yeah,
that would be fine,

22:43.600 --> 22:45.682
but I already
cleaned the room

22:45.800 --> 22:47.848
from top to bottom
after the creep left.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.407
And now there's a couple of
stoners sleeping in there.

22:50.480 --> 22:52.209
God knows what
they tracked in with them.

22:53.520 --> 22:54.806
(SIGHS)

22:55.760 --> 22:58.604
It's sort of funny that you
went into the service industry.

22:58.960 --> 23:01.122
You don't seem very keen
on serving anybody.

23:02.600 --> 23:04.364
I'm as keen
as I need to be.

23:05.400 --> 23:07.050
So what are you gonna
do now about Abernathy?

23:07.120 --> 23:08.087
Nothing.

23:08.160 --> 23:12.643
Nothing? You're a sheriff.
Law enforcement.

23:12.720 --> 23:15.166
You have ways of
finding things out,

23:15.800 --> 23:17.131
like, things you do.
Official things.

23:17.200 --> 23:18.486
Not unless
we have a lead.

23:18.560 --> 23:19.721
Do you have
anything else?

23:19.800 --> 23:22.565
I mean, besides the florist
card that says, "See you soon".

23:22.640 --> 23:24.165
Do you have a license
plate or any names

23:24.240 --> 23:25.241
that he might
have mentioned

23:25.320 --> 23:26.970
or a location
he might be going?

23:27.200 --> 23:28.326
Do you?

23:29.320 --> 23:30.321
No.

23:37.840 --> 23:39.046
All right.

23:39.680 --> 23:41.603
I'm gonna have your house
patrolled on the half hour.

23:41.680 --> 23:43.045
Let me know
if anything else happens.

23:49.440 --> 23:52.683
Oh, like what? Like he digs
up a couple more dead people

23:52.760 --> 23:54.250
and puts them
in my bed?

23:56.840 --> 23:59.047
Yeah, like that.
Night, Norma.

24:06.840 --> 24:08.171
(ENGINE STARTING)

25:22.360 --> 25:23.441
Hey-

25:23.520 --> 25:26.091
Hey.
Thanks for meeting me.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.685
So when can you sneak me
into my dad's office?

25:31.120 --> 25:33.202
You know, I was
just thinking that, um,

25:34.600 --> 25:36.443
maybe it's easier
for me to just go in and...

25:37.080 --> 25:38.969
And pack up and bring
the boxes to you.

25:40.800 --> 25:41.881
Okay-

25:43.640 --> 25:44.971
Okay, yeah.

25:45.680 --> 25:48.650
You know, I don't think it's a
good idea for you to be in there.

25:48.720 --> 25:51.530
Gil seems pretty upset with how
things ended up with your dad.

25:51.960 --> 25:53.610
Did he explain why?

25:53.960 --> 25:55.689
He didn't offer,
and I didn't ask.

26:01.920 --> 26:04.366
I just really wanted to see
my dad's office again.

26:06.680 --> 26:10.162
The way he set it up,
the way he left everything.

26:12.600 --> 26:15.763
My mom was so freaked out
about the way he died,

26:15.840 --> 26:18.730
she took all his things
and threw them away.

26:19.000 --> 26:23.005
Everything he had. It's like, it's
like he never even lived there.

26:26.200 --> 26:27.850
Like he's completely gone.

26:31.960 --> 26:33.724
And I just miss him.

26:37.480 --> 26:42.725
I just wanted to try to be
with him again,

26:45.200 --> 26:46.565
even if it was
for a few minutes,

26:46.640 --> 26:50.565
even if it was just
with his stuff.

26:56.760 --> 26:58.489
(SIGHS)

27:01.640 --> 27:02.971
All right.

27:05.640 --> 27:06.880
All right what?

27:07.200 --> 27:08.486
I'll get you in there.

27:11.400 --> 27:12.640
You sure?

27:13.280 --> 27:14.327
(CHUCKLES)

27:14.400 --> 27:17.768
No, but I'm gonna
do it anyways.

27:22.280 --> 27:23.566
Thank you.

27:23.880 --> 27:25.006
(CHUCKLES)

27:29.720 --> 27:31.290
(PHONE RINGING)

27:36.560 --> 27:39.723
Hello, Bates Motel. This is Emma.
How may I help you?

27:39.800 --> 27:42.451
BOY: <i>Yeah, hi.
I'm looking for Dave.</i>

27:43.120 --> 27:46.567
Um, I think you have
the wrong number. Sorry.

27:46.640 --> 27:48.722
Oh, I'm sorry.
Okay, bye.

28:06.120 --> 28:07.201
Mmm.

28:13.600 --> 28:14.647
Mmm.

28:25.720 --> 28:27.165
What, Mother?

28:27.360 --> 28:30.921
I found a beautiful,
little cottage in Hawaii.

28:31.240 --> 28:33.447
It's not on the beach,
those are a fortune.

28:33.520 --> 28:35.090
But it's up
in the mountains,

28:35.160 --> 28:36.605
and it's actually affordable

28:36.680 --> 28:38.091
if we get our money
out of this place.

28:38.160 --> 28:39.525
Mom, we can't move.

28:39.600 --> 28:43.207
Norman, I know you don't want to
move, but how can we stay here?

28:43.640 --> 28:48.521
Besides, Oahu is one of the top
ten safest places to live.

28:48.600 --> 28:49.761
You can't be serious.

28:49.840 --> 28:53.242
I'm totally serious. It's especially
safe because it's an island.

28:53.320 --> 28:54.970
I'm not talking
about it being safe.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.490
We can't move.

28:58.160 --> 28:59.650
I won't do it.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.001
You can't make me.

29:03.160 --> 29:05.401
Actually, yes, I can.
And we are,

29:05.480 --> 29:06.891
as soon as we
sell this place.

29:06.960 --> 29:08.610
We're having an open house
this weekend.

29:08.680 --> 29:10.284
You didn't listen to me.
I won't do it.

29:11.120 --> 29:13.600
Okay, this is just another one of
your stupid "starting over" ideas.

29:13.680 --> 29:16.160
I've been through enough of them.
I like it here.

29:16.880 --> 29:20.601
We can get jobs in the hotel industry.
We have experience now.

29:20.680 --> 29:21.761
We've been open three days.

29:21.840 --> 29:23.080
So they don't
have to know that.

29:23.160 --> 29:24.650
Oh, here we go again!

29:25.840 --> 29:27.729
That is totally unfair.

29:27.800 --> 29:30.326
No matter where we go, things
will always be the same.

29:30.400 --> 29:33.927
'Cause you do things that don't make sense!
You! You're crazy!

29:45.240 --> 29:47.891
I'm sorry, Mother. I didn't mean that.
(DOOR OPENS)

29:48.520 --> 29:52.491
I think there might be video
monitoring equipment in the office.

29:52.600 --> 29:55.171
What? Did you
see something?

29:55.800 --> 29:58.724
No, I just felt like
I was being watched.

29:58.960 --> 30:00.564
It was really
creeping me out.

30:01.080 --> 30:02.411
Well, do you know
who was watching you?

30:02.480 --> 30:04.767
I don't know.
I just felt like it.

30:04.880 --> 30:06.405
Well, who do you think it was?
I don't know.

30:07.680 --> 30:08.966
I got so nervous
down there,

30:09.040 --> 30:11.122
I wanted to come up
and see you guys.

30:12.400 --> 30:14.687
Then I started walking
up the stairs.

30:15.320 --> 30:18.324
Have you ever thought about
how long those stairs are?

30:18.560 --> 30:21.006
I just kept climbing
and climbing.

30:21.080 --> 30:23.845
Oh, my God.
Are you high?

30:23.920 --> 30:25.649
It was like more steps
just kept appearing

30:25.760 --> 30:28.445
like it was an escalator
that you climb. Hi.

30:28.520 --> 30:31.205
One more step just kept
coming out of nowhere

30:31.280 --> 30:33.089
like I was in space
or something.

30:33.160 --> 30:35.686
You smoke pot
with your condition?

30:35.760 --> 30:38.445
No. I ate it.

30:40.520 --> 30:44.525
It was in a cupcake. One of the
motel guests gave it to me.

30:44.600 --> 30:46.011
(SIGHS)

30:46.080 --> 30:49.482
You know, I've heard it's fun,
but I'm not having any fun yet.

30:49.560 --> 30:51.528
When does
the fun start? (SHRUGS)

30:52.120 --> 30:53.770
NORMA: You're having
a bad reaction.

30:53.840 --> 30:56.889
Norman, go make some toast
and get some orange juice.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.331
I can't send her home
like this. Poor thing.

30:59.960 --> 31:01.724
Mother, I'm sorry.
I don't think you're crazy.

31:01.800 --> 31:02.881
Get the toast.

31:28.960 --> 31:29.961
Drop. I got you.

31:34.280 --> 31:35.486
Thank you
for doing this.

31:36.160 --> 31:37.207
Yeah.

31:37.280 --> 31:39.089
You can't ever tell anybody about this.
You know that.

31:39.160 --> 31:41.401
I promise.
Let's go.

31:41.480 --> 31:43.562
(GUN FIRING)
(BRADLEY SCREAMS)

31:44.960 --> 31:47.201
Hey, come on. Stop shooting! It's me!
It's Dylan Massett!

31:47.280 --> 31:48.611
It's me! It's Dylan!

31:49.720 --> 31:51.006
Do you hear me?

31:53.040 --> 31:54.530
Step out, dumb ass.

31:55.840 --> 31:56.921
DYLAN: Remo?

31:59.680 --> 32:00.681
Put the gun down.

32:01.600 --> 32:02.965
Yeah, okay.

32:03.520 --> 32:05.204
Who's the other person
back there with you?

32:06.120 --> 32:07.246
Have them step up.

32:10.800 --> 32:11.801
Oh.

32:12.520 --> 32:14.204
You got to be
kidding me.

32:17.200 --> 32:19.521
Hey, Remo, look, could
you put the gun down?

32:23.000 --> 32:24.525
Aren't you
Jerry Martin's kid?

32:24.800 --> 32:25.801
Yeah.

32:25.920 --> 32:27.604
Uh, Brittany?

32:28.200 --> 32:29.201
Bradley.

32:29.360 --> 32:30.361
(EXHALES)

32:30.880 --> 32:32.405
Are you insane?

32:33.120 --> 32:34.167
Look, I only
brought her here,

32:34.240 --> 32:36.004
so she can get
some of her dad's stuff.

32:36.080 --> 32:37.286
All right?
Gil wouldn't let her.

32:37.360 --> 32:38.885
Yeah, you think
I don't know that?

32:39.360 --> 32:42.364
You think I don't know how Gil feels
about Jerry Martin, dumb ass?

32:43.280 --> 32:44.964
You got any idea
what kind of a position

32:45.040 --> 32:47.088
you put me in
bringing her down here?

32:50.640 --> 32:52.290
We'll be in and out
in ten minutes.

32:57.960 --> 32:59.405
What are you
waiting for?

33:00.720 --> 33:03.007
Come on. Let's go.

33:11.240 --> 33:12.321
I'm really sorry.

33:29.040 --> 33:30.849
Everything is just
how he left it.

33:34.280 --> 33:35.964
I didn't think
it would hit me like this.

33:38.800 --> 33:40.290
You want a minute?
No.

33:42.880 --> 33:44.291
I like
having you here.

33:51.360 --> 33:55.570
He had this old, beautiful,
gold pocket watch.

33:55.640 --> 33:58.291
And when I was little, we would
wind it up together and...

33:59.680 --> 34:01.444
And he showed me
how to pop it open.

34:01.560 --> 34:03.961
And it's just the one thing
that I really want to find.

34:24.920 --> 34:26.001
What is it?

34:30.679 --> 34:32.011
Oh, my God.

34:32.920 --> 34:34.409
Oh, my God.
I have to leave.

34:42.800 --> 34:43.847
Hey-

34:45.320 --> 34:46.525
You Okay?

34:48.600 --> 34:50.045
They're from a woman.

34:51.400 --> 34:54.688
B. "All my love, B."
Who's B?

34:55.719 --> 34:57.130
Why would he do this?

34:59.040 --> 35:00.610
People are complicated.

35:05.360 --> 35:06.930
Okay? He's still your dad.

35:08.400 --> 35:09.686
He still loved you.

35:12.760 --> 35:15.206
I know that he had to love you.
Because who wouldn't?

35:31.600 --> 35:33.284
Come on.
We need to go.

35:37.600 --> 35:38.647
Come on.

35:44.040 --> 35:45.326
(KNOCKING)

35:45.640 --> 35:47.449
Norman, can I
sleep in here?

35:48.040 --> 35:50.088
I'm still just so scared
to sleep in that room.

35:50.880 --> 35:52.962
Sure. I'll sleep
on the floor.

35:53.360 --> 35:55.966
No, I don't want you to
have to sleep on the floor.

35:56.040 --> 35:57.371
We'll both fit.

36:13.960 --> 36:16.531
Remember when we used to have
sleepovers when you were little,

36:16.600 --> 36:18.329
and we'd watch
movies in my room?

36:19.760 --> 36:20.921
Yeah, I remember.

36:21.400 --> 36:23.721
That always made me
really happy.

36:26.280 --> 36:28.442
I know. Me too.

36:41.280 --> 36:44.045
I'm sorry, Norman,
about the moving.

36:45.800 --> 36:47.086
It's all right, Mother.

36:48.880 --> 36:51.326
I'm sorry I said you were crazy.
You're not crazy.

36:51.400 --> 36:52.640
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

37:00.080 --> 37:01.605
Let's go to sleep.

37:11.440 --> 37:12.566
Norman.

37:12.640 --> 37:14.085
Are we finishing your story
after school?

37:15.200 --> 37:16.690
I don't think
we should send it in.

37:18.880 --> 37:19.961
Why not?

37:21.760 --> 37:26.641
I don't think my mom would, uh,
would like it being published.

37:27.840 --> 37:28.841
Have you asked her?

37:28.920 --> 37:31.924
Nah, there's no point.
She's not gonna get it.

37:35.360 --> 37:37.567
Well, how are the
therapy appointments going?

37:40.800 --> 37:42.165
I went once.

37:49.200 --> 37:51.009
Sorry about the story.

37:52.360 --> 37:53.407
Norman.

37:54.400 --> 37:55.401
(SIGHS)

37:56.680 --> 37:58.808
Oh, how should
I say this? Hmm.

37:59.880 --> 38:00.881
I think
you're a good kid,

38:00.960 --> 38:03.850
and I think your talent deserves
to be recognized, so, um...

38:05.800 --> 38:08.280
You don't really
need to tell her.

38:10.040 --> 38:11.405
That doesn't seem right.

38:19.240 --> 38:20.890
I know what
it's like for you.

38:22.440 --> 38:23.566
I have a sense, anyway.

38:24.960 --> 38:26.610
I've had a lot of troubles
in my own life,

38:26.720 --> 38:28.609
so I can see when
things aren't fair.

38:31.120 --> 38:34.727
What I'm saying is that, what is the
likelihood that she'll ever know?

38:37.720 --> 38:40.610
The square footage.
Too much.

38:40.680 --> 38:42.364
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

38:43.400 --> 38:44.561
Oh, shit.

38:48.400 --> 38:50.562
Matt? It's the
end of the day.

38:50.680 --> 38:52.284
You haven't called.

38:52.360 --> 38:54.169
What are the details
of the open house tomorrow?

38:54.240 --> 38:56.242
I was thinking I could
bake some cookies,

38:56.320 --> 38:58.129
give the place that
fresh-baked smell.

39:00.040 --> 39:04.250
What? Um, there's not
gonna be an open house.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.161
Why not?

39:06.280 --> 39:08.169
Look, Norma,
I looked into it,

39:08.280 --> 39:10.487
and there's no market
for your property.

39:10.560 --> 39:12.369
Not with the new
bypass road going in.

39:13.280 --> 39:15.328
I can't get you
your money back.

39:16.440 --> 39:18.681
Well, how much
can you sell it for?

39:18.760 --> 39:20.649
I mean, it has a value.
What's its value?

39:20.720 --> 39:21.926
(EXHALES)

39:22.000 --> 39:24.207
Maybe half what
you paid for it.

39:24.280 --> 39:27.568
You're underwater. The best thing
you can do is to just walk away.

39:27.640 --> 39:28.721
Let the bank
take it back.

39:28.800 --> 39:31.326
You want me to walk away
from my investment?

39:31.400 --> 39:33.289
I'm not gonna do that.
I can't do that!

39:33.680 --> 39:34.761
I don't know
what else to tell you.

39:34.840 --> 39:36.604
Are you kidding me?
I will sue you!

39:37.120 --> 39:42.729
(CHUCKLES) You can, um, but
I'm 30,000 dollars in debt.

39:42.800 --> 39:46.407
I live with my girlfriend, and my mom
owns my car, so I don't think...

39:48.360 --> 39:50.966
Oh, God, okay! Oh!

40:07.200 --> 40:08.201
(EXHALES)

40:13.680 --> 40:14.681
(SIGHS)

40:24.640 --> 40:26.210
(MUFFLED WHIMPERING)

40:30.000 --> 40:32.367
Did you get the present
I left on your bed?

40:33.360 --> 40:36.204
Yeah, I'm done
being polite.

40:36.280 --> 40:38.009
I see it doesn't
work with you.

40:39.200 --> 40:44.604
Now, I'm gonna take my
hand away from your mouth.

40:44.680 --> 40:46.569
And you're not gonna scream,
or you're gonna be dead.

40:46.680 --> 40:50.207
Nod if you understand. Mmm-hmm.

40:50.600 --> 40:52.090
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

40:52.160 --> 40:54.561
Good. I'm not kidding.

40:56.240 --> 41:00.529
Zack Shelby owed me $150,000 from the
sale of the last batch of girls.

41:00.600 --> 41:04.525
With his death,
that money's gone missing.

41:05.480 --> 41:06.891
I was talking to
everyone else involved.

41:06.960 --> 41:09.042
No one else has it,
so that leaves you.

41:09.880 --> 41:12.121
Why do you think
that I... (GASPS)

41:12.720 --> 41:13.721
Just listen.

41:15.880 --> 41:17.245
I know that you have it,

41:18.760 --> 41:21.491
and I need you to bring me
that money tomorrow night.

41:24.080 --> 41:26.924
At the Seacliff Pier
at midnight.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.286
It's okay.

41:32.560 --> 41:34.767
So here's my question.
Can you do that?

41:36.480 --> 41:38.881
Hmm? Can you
bring me my money?

41:44.560 --> 41:45.607
Yes.

41:48.240 --> 41:50.481
You'll be there tomorrow
night with the 150,000?

41:51.560 --> 41:52.607
Yes.

41:54.360 --> 41:55.521
Good girl.

41:57.280 --> 41:59.965
Remember, I know where
you live, you know I do.

42:01.720 --> 42:04.564
If I have to come to your house,
I'll kill your sons first.

42:06.320 --> 42:07.651
And then I'll kill you.

42:10.040 --> 42:11.405
Good night.
