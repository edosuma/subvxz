00:01.101 --> 00:02.135
My name is Lena Grisky

00:02.168 --> 00:05.171
and I go to the best
ballet school in the world.

00:05.205 --> 00:06.372
I have a secret.

00:06.406 --> 00:08.374
I'm a time traveler from
1905

00:08.408 --> 00:11.011
and my boyfriend Henri
is doing everything he can
to get me home.

(Ines) Previously...
Lena and Max decided
they were just friends.

00:48.749 --> 00:52.285
It's what I was hoping for...
-But Thea is still totally
furious at Lena...

00:52.318 --> 00:54.855
(Thea) You will have
regrets.
Big ones!

00:54.888 --> 00:57.257
The Time Collectors
are building a portal.

00:57.290 --> 00:59.626
Our very own time
transporter.
-Do you need me?

00:59.660 --> 01:01.628
Henri made a fake alliance with
them.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.264
As for me, Dash thinks we're
more than just friends.

01:04.297 --> 01:06.399
Why would you think
this was a date?

01:14.307 --> 01:18.545
Hey! Oh, don't worry.
I won't make the same mistake
I did the other day.

01:18.579 --> 01:22.348
I am super aware that you
and I are just warming up.
This is not a date.

01:22.382 --> 01:25.318
Good, cause that's
neeeever gonna happen.

01:27.153 --> 01:29.856
Ines.
You hurt his feelings again.

01:30.557 --> 01:36.663
(Jeff) Woohoohoo!
What is up, dancing queens!
And kings.

01:37.531 --> 01:41.334
Come on. It's a beautiful day,
with some beautiful people!

01:42.335 --> 01:44.370
Come on, if you guys don't
give me anything,
I'm gonna have to resort

01:44.404 --> 01:48.542
to some never-before-seen
tactics here.
-(Lena giggles)

01:48.575 --> 01:52.779
OK! Don't say I didn't
warn you
about the onslaught of dancing
you're about to witness.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.781
Whoa!
-Hold that.

01:54.815 --> 01:57.584
(hip-hop music plays)

01:57.618 --> 01:58.885
Check it.

01:58.919 --> 02:02.222
Ah! Aahhh!

02:04.190 --> 02:05.759
Whoa. Whoa!

02:06.326 --> 02:07.861
(students laugh)

02:14.400 --> 02:16.703
(students continue to laugh)

02:20.641 --> 02:22.809
Guys, it's Ms Carré.
We are meant to be
in the boys' studio, come on!

02:24.611 --> 02:26.346
(Max) Dude, dude, Jeff!

02:27.714 --> 02:29.516
(Dash) Jeff! Jeff!

02:30.784 --> 02:32.819
Time to go! Jeff!

02:32.853 --> 02:37.157
(Jeff) Ahhh! Ohhh! Yeah!
Wooh!

02:38.992 --> 02:40.861
Wooh!

02:42.629 --> 02:45.832
Oops. Yes. Aaah!

02:46.466 --> 02:53.439
Oh, pardon me, Ms Carré.
I had a... a... foot cramp.
Needed to sh... shake it off.

03:01.715 --> 03:04.751
Sorry, Ms Carré. We were
just color coding Thea's closet.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.419
Or doing homework.
(nervous laugh)

03:06.687 --> 03:09.355
Priorities, ladies!

03:09.823 --> 03:13.393
(Ms Carré) So...
Your teamwork
needs some attention.

03:13.426 --> 03:17.998
You will perform a trio
scene study of your choosing.
Tomorrow.

03:18.031 --> 03:23.570
First trio:
Bree, Kennedy, Véronique.
-(both laugh)

03:23.604 --> 03:27.841
Second trio:
Lena, Ines and Thea.

03:28.909 --> 03:31.812
Well, isn't this going to be
fun.
-The most fun.

03:32.312 --> 03:34.414
I couldn't be happier.
-I'm the happiest I've ever
been.

03:34.447 --> 03:38.552
Whatever this is,
keep it out of the studio,
ladies.

03:40.020 --> 03:42.856
I'll see you tomorrow.
-No problem at all.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.591
Easy.
-Peasy.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.226
Easy-peasy.

03:46.259 --> 03:49.329
This is gonna be amazing.
I can't believe
we get to choose.

03:49.863 --> 03:54.400
Well, whatever we do
choose,
it has to give us
some serious edge.

03:54.434 --> 03:56.837
Something contemporary
that pushes the boundaries.

03:57.403 --> 04:00.440
Oh! We did one last year
that was brand new
and everyone loved it!

04:01.041 --> 04:03.877
(whispers) Remember, last year
for you was 1904.

04:04.511 --> 04:09.382
Oh yeah.
Too bad, The Flower
would have been so perfect.

04:10.016 --> 04:13.954
Did you just say The Flower?
No one ever does The Flower.

04:13.987 --> 04:18.424
We'd surprise Ms Carré
by picking something so ancient.
It's so old, it's... new.

04:18.458 --> 04:21.294
Sure, it's old.
But it also has a modern tone.
It's perfect.

04:21.595 --> 04:24.330
It's better than perfect.
It's got heart,
complexity, nuance.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.767
More like bold. Shocking,
even.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.069
She'll love it.
-Maybe she'll even
crack a smile after.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.871
Yeah!

04:31.705 --> 04:35.776
(unsure) So... We're all
in agreement, then, yeah?

04:40.013 --> 04:43.383
Oh boy. Let's get to work.

04:43.784 --> 04:47.921
(classical piano music plays)

04:59.900 --> 05:01.835
(phone beeps)

05:01.868 --> 05:04.971
(Dash whispers)
Bro. No phones in class.

05:05.005 --> 05:09.075
(Max whispers) That rule
only applies if you get caught.
I don't intend to.

05:11.377 --> 05:12.879
(Etienne)
Careful now.
Sit up straight.

05:14.014 --> 05:16.016
And the head. Perfect.

05:17.383 --> 05:20.587
(Max) Whoa, guys...
Guys, it's Group XS!

05:21.121 --> 05:24.057
(reads) Dance-off.
Be there or forfeit
the challenge for good.

05:24.090 --> 05:26.660
(laughs) I am so in!

05:26.693 --> 05:28.762
(Dash) Incoming teacher!

05:28.795 --> 05:34.067
So this one is really good
for your hamstrings.
-Right.

05:34.100 --> 05:37.070
(Max) Hmm! It's a good one.

05:38.071 --> 05:40.406
You know saying yes to this
is against the rules, right?

05:40.440 --> 05:45.812
Dash, come on! Like
I said, only if you get caught.
I'll see you there.

05:47.180 --> 05:50.617
This one's also really good
for your calves.

05:50.651 --> 05:53.119
(Dash) Ooh.
-(Max) Hmmm.

06:06.833 --> 06:10.704
(Henri) That's impressive.
How did you figure out
something so complex?

06:10.737 --> 06:13.139
Uh... Uh...
Because I'm brilliant.

06:14.508 --> 06:18.512
And because of that
brilliance,
we are moments away
from being able to time travel

06:18.545 --> 06:22.616
anywhere, anytime
without having to worry
about timepieces or portal days.

06:22.649 --> 06:23.884
Which is the ultimate
goal.

06:25.752 --> 06:28.889
(Clive) But a chicken hatches
out of an egg.
-(Pinky) And the egg comes out
of the chicken.

06:30.123 --> 06:33.493
Well, what if it's a
turkey's egg?
-It's still an egg, Clive.

06:33.527 --> 06:36.396
(Frank) Hey, forget about that.
Come on.

06:38.999 --> 06:43.103
What do you think? Eh?
Do you wanna try guess
what it is?

06:46.039 --> 06:49.843
OK. Let me help.
It's the world's first...?

06:50.176 --> 06:53.179
Door?
-(Clive laughs)

06:53.213 --> 06:56.149
Come on, Pinky. Clive?

06:56.717 --> 06:59.119
Uh... Rectangle?

06:59.820 --> 07:01.154
Hopeless...

07:02.523 --> 07:05.759
This is our way to the future.
By use of gravitational
fields...

07:05.792 --> 07:10.130
It's a time travel portal.
Hey! It's a port-a-portal!

07:10.163 --> 07:10.997
(all three laugh)

07:11.031 --> 07:12.799
Why didn't you
think of that, Frank?

07:15.068 --> 07:18.605
(Clive) You're funny.
-(Pinky) I like you.

07:29.616 --> 07:36.857
What a miraculous creation.
Who would have thought to put
eggs and mayonnaise... together.

07:46.166 --> 07:49.736
I wish I could finish
the whole thing,
but I'm stuffed.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.538
Don't waste it.
Save it for later.

07:51.938 --> 07:54.641
That's a great idea!
-(giggles)

07:59.746 --> 08:01.081
(laughs)

08:05.619 --> 08:07.187
May I dine with the dream team?

08:09.756 --> 08:15.662
So... Let's talk strategy.
Bree, Kennedy and Véronique.
How can we destroy them?

08:16.096 --> 08:17.698
(coughs) Thea!

08:17.731 --> 08:20.834
It's just a simple case
of sports psychology, Ines.

08:20.867 --> 08:23.236
Like, Kennedy gets the sweats
when she's nervous.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.772
So if I insist
she wears a grey bodysuit

08:25.806 --> 08:29.042
she'll be armpit-conscious
for the entire performance.
-(Lena laughs)

08:29.075 --> 08:34.314
And, Bree gets dizzy way easy.
What can we do with that intel?

08:34.347 --> 08:37.984
Oh! Tell her Ms Carré
gives bonus points
for lots of pirouettes.

08:38.018 --> 08:41.287
(Ines) Lena!
-OMG, girl! That's perfect.

08:41.321 --> 08:42.689
Bree believes everything I tell
her.

08:42.723 --> 08:45.058
(phone beeps)

08:46.727 --> 08:50.731
(whispers) "Girl?"
Thea's only using you.
She only looks out for herself.

08:51.197 --> 08:55.769
No, she's finally being nice.
Come on, let's give
her a chance.

08:57.237 --> 09:02.175
It's from Max. "Hey babe,
Blok rehearsals are starting.
Where are you?"

09:03.343 --> 09:07.213
"Hey Boo. Sorry, we can't
make it. We're rehearsing
for our assignment.

09:07.948 --> 09:10.951
Promise I'll make it up to you.
Kisses."

09:10.984 --> 09:13.219
Good idea.
Shall we get to work?

09:13.920 --> 09:15.589
Finally. Let's roll.

09:15.856 --> 09:18.191
I just had an inspired
idea.

09:29.936 --> 09:31.271
Do you guys like rom-coms?

09:31.304 --> 09:33.106
What's a rom-com?
-Barf.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.075
Oh no, are you sick?

09:35.108 --> 09:39.746
She's not sick.
She just doesn't like rom-coms.
As in romantic comedies.

09:39.780 --> 09:44.350
You mean propaganda that wants
us to believe that boys are the
answers to all our problems?

09:44.384 --> 09:46.252
Then you're right. I
don't.

09:46.820 --> 09:49.656
Anyway, I wanted to show you
guys this movie for research.

09:49.990 --> 09:55.161
It's an adaptation of The Flower
starring uber babe JJ Jacobson!
(squeals)

09:56.362 --> 09:58.899
Didn't we tell the boys
we were rehearsing?

09:58.932 --> 10:00.200
Uh, yeah. What do you call
this?

10:00.701 --> 10:01.868
I call it watching a
movie.

10:02.936 --> 10:07.173
And I call it research.
OMG. Look at JJ's muscles.

10:08.108 --> 10:11.878
So what exactly did we mean
when we told the boys
we were "rehearsing"?

10:12.312 --> 10:16.650
Never be honest with boys.
It's too confusing for them.
(both chuckle)

10:16.683 --> 10:18.384
Whatever...
-Shhh!

10:23.857 --> 10:27.227
Should we try it?
-Yeah. OK.
I'm this one.

10:29.896 --> 10:33.667
(Lena) One and two and three.
And tadata. And tadata...

10:38.972 --> 10:41.808
Is Thea having fun?

10:42.108 --> 10:47.080
-With Lena? She's planning
something seriously bad.

10:47.113 --> 10:48.949
This is way worse
than we thought.

10:50.416 --> 10:51.685
(both giggle)

10:52.252 --> 10:55.321
She never dances
with me like that.

10:55.889 --> 10:58.224
(hip-hop beat plays)

10:58.258 --> 11:01.962
(Jeff) Bro! Check it out:
whenever a crew loses
to Group XS,

11:01.995 --> 11:07.100
they're forced to post the
footage online with the hashtag
ViralLosers. Isn't that brutal?

11:07.133 --> 11:10.003
Brutal? It's worse than that.

11:10.036 --> 11:13.840
If we lose, we risk
being exposed online and
getting kicked out of school.

11:13.874 --> 11:15.976
Well, we're not gonna lose.
'Cause we got Max.

11:16.009 --> 11:19.212
And he is gonna come up
with something totally fresh
and awesome. Right, Max?

11:19.245 --> 11:20.747
I'm trying.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.883
(video plays on tablet)

11:22.916 --> 11:27.220
Oh! No way.
Wow, that is nasty!

11:30.390 --> 11:33.994
(Max) That's the losing team?
-They're really good...

11:34.027 --> 11:38.965
(Jeff) Guys, calm down. All we
gotta do is come up with some
sick moves and run with it.

11:39.533 --> 11:43.436
He's right. Come on, boys.
We just... don't... lose.

11:43.469 --> 11:46.372
If we're not sleeping,
we're dancing. Alright?

11:46.406 --> 11:48.308
Now get up,
come on, let's try this.

11:48.842 --> 11:53.780
One. Two. Three.
Four. Five. Six.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.081
Uh-hm.
-All right?

11:55.115 --> 11:56.750
Yeah.
-Ready?

11:56.783 --> 11:59.953
One. Two. Three.
Four. Five. Six.

11:59.986 --> 12:02.989
And hmm!
-Oh oh oh! Snap!

12:04.390 --> 12:09.863
I love rom-comedies!
They're funny, and then happy,
then sad.

12:09.896 --> 12:13.800
And then happy again.
And then sad. And then sweet.

12:13.834 --> 12:19.172
I just felt so many different
things. And JJ Jacobson is
almost as cute as Henri.

12:20.406 --> 12:23.510
Wait, what are you doing?
Are you packing?
Where are you going?

12:24.077 --> 12:25.278
Moving out. Clearly.

12:26.012 --> 12:28.949
Why?
-Because I hate that movie.

12:28.982 --> 12:33.186
OK, as your friend, I have to
say you're acting kind of weird.
What's going on?

12:33.219 --> 12:35.989
Friend? I thought
Thea was your new friend.

12:36.022 --> 12:39.526
Go and enjoy time
with your new BFF,
'cause I'm out of here.

12:40.193 --> 12:42.796
Everyone always leaves
anyway.

12:53.507 --> 12:58.144
Ta-da! I brought you
breakfast.
-Lena, I'm not hungry.

12:58.178 --> 13:02.182
OK. I'm ready for this.
I watched an amazing show
on the talking box.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.117
Oh no.
-Oh yes!

13:04.150 --> 13:06.920
It was about friendship.
And Dr Paul said it's important

13:06.953 --> 13:09.222
to sit across from each other
and maintain good eye contact.

13:09.255 --> 13:12.559
No, not Dr Paul...
-Uh, peppeppep.

13:12.593 --> 13:17.931
Talk about how you feel.
This is a safe place.

13:17.964 --> 13:23.203
Sit in a comfortable position
and let the words flow.

13:23.637 --> 13:25.806
(laughs)

13:26.239 --> 13:27.508
Is this ridiculous?

13:29.442 --> 13:33.413
Lena, he's not a real doctor.
He's just playing it for TV.

13:33.446 --> 13:35.248
But he was wearing a lab
coat.

13:35.281 --> 13:37.050
He's a talk show host.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.986
Can we just be friends
again?

13:40.020 --> 13:44.124
Why? You'll be leaving soon
anyway. Just like everyone else.

13:46.326 --> 13:50.964
It worked.
He may be a talking host
but I directed you to the truth,

13:51.364 --> 13:54.034
just like he taught in the
show.
(squeals)

13:54.067 --> 13:58.004
Yeah, well, the truth is
the worst.
-I know!

13:58.038 --> 14:02.543
And I know you hate
hugging but I'm just gonna keep
doing it until you stop pushing
me away.

14:04.177 --> 14:08.048
Hey. You're still pushing.
-You're squishing me.

14:08.081 --> 14:09.983
(both giggle)

14:10.917 --> 14:13.920
You know, I don't really know
that much about you.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.522
You really don't tell
people much about yourself.

14:15.556 --> 14:18.324
Yeah. Everyone says that
to me.

14:18.358 --> 14:21.061
Maybe you don't want
people to know you?

14:21.094 --> 14:25.566
Oh, I see! Playing blanket forts
was more important
than our 6 a. m. trio rehearsal!

14:25.599 --> 14:30.403
Thea! I'm so sorry.
We can practice after academics.

14:30.971 --> 14:33.674
In what dimension do you think
that gives us enough time?

14:33.707 --> 14:36.009
How about some breakfast?

14:38.979 --> 14:42.448
Well, I haven't eaten yet
because, you know,
I was rehearsing.

14:46.520 --> 14:50.557
Dr Paul suggested a game.
Do you want to try it?
-Alright.

14:50.591 --> 14:53.527
It's called Fifty Things
I Learn about You.

14:53.560 --> 14:58.198
So, I ask you a question
and you have to answer honestly.

14:58.231 --> 15:03.704
But whatever I ask you, I have
to answer it too. You ready?
-Uh-hm.

15:03.737 --> 15:07.207
One: What's
your favorite veggie?

15:07.240 --> 15:10.410
Brussels sprouts...
Pan-fried.

15:11.645 --> 15:16.016
Mine's pineapple.
Which I know is a fruit,
but I'm obsessed.

15:18.985 --> 15:21.421
Dash was right. We're not ready.

15:21.454 --> 15:25.425
No. Dash is just
a highly-wound over-achiever.
We're fine.

15:25.458 --> 15:29.530
Look, I know you wanna go, Jeff,
but if we lose,
I risk everything.

15:29.563 --> 15:32.298
Hey, we all do.
-Not like I do.

15:32.332 --> 15:33.800
Wow.
-What's that supposed to mean?

15:33.834 --> 15:37.303
Oh, it means that, as usual,
Mr Prep School here
thinks he's the king

15:37.337 --> 15:38.539
and his fate matters more
than the rest of us.

15:38.572 --> 15:42.442
(scoffs) Chill, man.
That's not what he's saying.
Is it?

15:42.475 --> 15:44.410
Of course not, Jeff.

15:44.444 --> 15:50.350
Told ya. Max, you always think
you got nothing
and then you crush it.

15:50.383 --> 15:55.522
Not this time.
The Blok is not ready. Alright?

15:55.556 --> 15:59.960
Now I'm gonna go
down there later
and tell Group XS we're out.

16:01.294 --> 16:04.230
Give me till the end ofthe day
to figure this out.

16:05.331 --> 16:09.169
My first dog was named
Sir Fluffington.

16:09.202 --> 16:14.541
Aw! My first pet was
a carrier pigeon, Augustine.

16:14.575 --> 16:16.577
Favorite musical band?

16:17.544 --> 16:21.381
Box of Kittens.
-Mozart. (laughs)

16:21.414 --> 16:25.051
Hardest thing in the world
for you to do?
-Asking for help.

16:25.085 --> 16:30.390
I guess I've always been
like that, but it got worse
when my parents got divorced.

16:30.791 --> 16:34.060
I'm sorry.
That must've been
really hard for you.

16:37.531 --> 16:40.300
That food you gave me was bad.
-What?

16:41.101 --> 16:43.737
Oh my gosh, are you okay?

16:43.770 --> 16:45.506
(Thea retches)

16:47.508 --> 16:49.409
I swear I didn't do
anything.

16:49.442 --> 16:50.777
Lena. What did you give
her?

16:51.311 --> 16:52.646
Just the egg salad
from yesterday.

16:54.380 --> 16:58.418
Please tell meyou put it in the
fridge and not in your bag
overnight?
-(Dash giggles)

16:58.451 --> 17:01.454
Lena, you always put
leftovers in the fridge!
-(Dash laughs)

17:01.487 --> 17:06.560
You mean the cooling box?
Oh no. This is awful.

17:06.593 --> 17:09.495
Hey, it was an honest
mistake.

17:10.363 --> 17:13.534
What are we going to do
now that our trio is down
to a twosome?

17:13.567 --> 17:15.669
We need to find Thea.

17:17.671 --> 17:21.742
I don't trust this. I
don't even
understand what this is.

17:21.775 --> 17:25.812
but my highly attuned instincts
say that something is up.

17:25.846 --> 17:31.417
Something is def up.
We need to lay low.
Or transfer schools...

17:33.419 --> 17:36.523
(hip-hop music plays)

17:44.397 --> 17:46.332
(Dash) So what's
your big plan, Jeff?

17:46.366 --> 17:49.570
'Cause from where I'm standing,
things are not looking good.

17:50.136 --> 17:55.208
(Jeff) Watch and learn,
my bro-star. It's time
for my famous "Jeff Talk".

17:55.241 --> 17:56.777
That's trademarked,
so don't use it.

17:56.810 --> 17:59.813
(Dash) My name's not Jeff,
so I can't really... use it.

18:02.516 --> 18:05.085
Hey, dude, that's sick.

18:07.287 --> 18:10.824
Hey. I respect what you said.
But I think
you underestimate us.

18:11.457 --> 18:14.427
We're in this together.
Yo, check it out.

18:15.395 --> 18:16.830
Stop it.

18:18.364 --> 18:23.203
I can't think of a new sequence.
And you're not gonna
convince me otherwise.

18:28.374 --> 18:29.943
You've got this, Thea.

18:29.976 --> 18:36.216
And you don't look that bad.
I think you carry
"sweaty and pale" pretty well.

18:37.217 --> 18:40.554
(Ms Carré)
First up: Thea, Lena and Ines.

18:40.587 --> 18:46.126
We've got you, OK?
Remember: you're
an amazing dancer!

18:50.230 --> 18:52.866
(classical music plays)

19:29.536 --> 19:30.470
Fine.

19:36.643 --> 19:38.444
Is that good?

19:38.478 --> 19:44.284
Ms Carré never gives feedback.
The fact that she said anything
means everything. We did great.

19:45.418 --> 19:48.955
(Ms Carré) Dash, please take
Thea to the nurse's office.
She looks frightful.

19:55.428 --> 20:00.300
Win-win! We crushed
the challenge, and Thea's
still queen of the castle.

20:00.333 --> 20:05.872
And we're friends again.
Look, I'm sorry I flipped out
about Thea for a second, there.

20:05.906 --> 20:07.473
It's OK.

20:07.941 --> 20:09.743
(both laugh)

20:12.045 --> 20:15.248
Hey, I need to meet you
in the courtyard now.

20:15.549 --> 20:20.921
And Ines, I need you
to help me out with something
for Max. (whispers)

20:22.022 --> 20:24.257
(chuckles) OK.

20:33.767 --> 20:38.939
(Frank) We're so close.
There must be something missing.
It should be working by now.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.882
Aren't you even just
a little bit afraid of us?

20:49.516 --> 20:51.051
Nah.

20:51.084 --> 20:55.021
Is it 'cause we're such good
lads that we couldn't even hurt
a flea?
-Shh!

20:55.055 --> 20:57.023
(Henri) Nope.
It's not that either.

20:57.057 --> 20:59.926
Obviously you've got
something to say. Spit it out.

20:59.960 --> 21:06.266
(sighs) What if I told you
I know exactly why your
little project isn't working?

21:06.833 --> 21:08.134
Go on.

21:08.168 --> 21:13.439
In fact, I know exactly
how you got
the port-a-portal diagram,

21:14.040 --> 21:16.910
and I may have left some things
out when I knew you were spying.

21:18.512 --> 21:19.680
Tell me what you know.

21:19.713 --> 21:23.517
I'm afraid it's all up there
in my little pretty head.

21:23.550 --> 21:26.753
Tell me what you know,
or I'll...

21:26.787 --> 21:28.321
I uhhh uhhh...
-I'm gonna...

21:28.354 --> 21:34.961
You... uh... uh...
What you gonna do Frank?
What you gonna do? (laughs)

21:46.106 --> 21:52.846
(threatening) You tell me
how to fix that portal.
Right now.

21:52.879 --> 21:55.616
(suspenseful music)

21:55.649 --> 21:58.685
I'll help you build the portal,
as long as I get the girl.

21:59.553 --> 22:03.690
And you can have the timepiece.
All I care about is Lena.

22:10.731 --> 22:12.365
So, what do you think?

22:12.766 --> 22:15.869
We want the portal to work,
whatever the cost.

22:15.902 --> 22:19.405
And we can always figure a way
to get Lena again
if we need her.

22:19.439 --> 22:22.809
In the meantime,
I think we say yes.

22:24.444 --> 22:26.079
Alright. Let's do it.

22:26.813 --> 22:28.615
Welcome to the team,
Henri!

22:31.417 --> 22:33.987
(Frank) We've got a deal.
Don't try anything funny.

22:34.988 --> 22:36.590
Ditto.

23:05.852 --> 23:10.390
Haven't seen you since that time
I crushed you at Paul G's.
Let's see what you've got.

23:10.724 --> 23:12.926
I'm not gonna dance.

23:12.959 --> 23:14.995
(Jeff) Hey!

23:20.934 --> 23:23.570
Dude. We've got this.

23:31.812 --> 23:35.081
(hip-hop music plays)

24:31.071 --> 24:34.741
Not bad. Blok is officially in.
See you next time.

24:35.141 --> 24:37.611
(all cheer)

24:43.584 --> 24:46.687
Dude...
-Thanks, man. You proved
me wrong.

24:46.987 --> 24:49.890
You're family, man.
Always got your back.

24:52.258 --> 24:54.027
(Jeff) Yeahhh!
-(Dash) What?!

24:54.060 --> 24:57.731
(all cheer)

25:00.033 --> 25:02.068
(phone rings)

25:23.089 --> 25:30.864
(giggles) OK. Um. Question
49: what was your favorite
moment from today?

25:33.133 --> 25:35.802
The look on Max's face
when he caught the mask.

25:36.169 --> 25:41.942
Mine was when we told Thea
she wore sweaty and pale well.
(both laugh)

25:43.777 --> 25:45.746
Her face!

25:45.779 --> 25:48.682
Thank you for being
an amazing friend.

25:50.684 --> 25:51.885
(both chuckle)

25:55.321 --> 25:57.991
(laughs)

25:59.192 --> 26:00.026
What?

26:00.994 --> 26:02.529
Nothing.

26:02.563 --> 26:05.999
I noticed you had rips
all over your denim trousers,
so I fixed them for you.

26:06.032 --> 26:09.670
Thanks.
You are quite the seamstress.

26:18.278 --> 26:20.781
Question 50...

26:22.248 --> 26:24.317
who's your best friend?

26:24.350 --> 26:27.287
A ballerina called Lena.
Who's yours?

26:27.320 --> 26:30.090
A wild child named Ines.
(both laugh)
