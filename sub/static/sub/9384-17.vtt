to get the fat vacuumed out of my belly.

11:56.258 --> 11:57.342
What?

11:57.426 --> 12:00.679
I didn't do it. I'm just gonna stay
on my diet and exercise.

12:00.762 --> 12:03.849
Good for you.
That was a very grown-up decision.

12:03.932 --> 12:06.185
I mean, what kind of lazy, narcissistic...

12:06.268 --> 12:09.188
...irresponsible moron would
even consider doing something...

12:09.271 --> 12:11.732
...as unbelievably foolish
as getting liposuction.

12:11.815 --> 12:13.400
Who, I ask you. Who?

12:13.650 --> 12:14.776
Hello.

12:19.948 --> 12:21.408
[Stuttering]

12:23.368 --> 12:25.454
My God! It's finally happened.

12:25.537 --> 12:29.458
He's become so massive he's collapsed
into himself like a neutron star!

12:29.583 --> 12:31.418
MEG: Mom, can I get lipo, too?

12:31.502 --> 12:32.753
Forget it, Meg.

12:32.836 --> 12:37.341
Peter, you can't just suck 200 pounds
of fat out of yourself. It's not natural.

12:37.424 --> 12:40.802
Come on, Lois. I feel great dropping
that kind of weight all at once.

12:40.886 --> 12:43.222
Remember how good you felt
after you had Chris?

12:50.479 --> 12:52.189
And they're off!

12:56.360 --> 12:58.403
Well then, giddy up.

12:58.570 --> 12:59.571
[Laughing]

12:59.655 --> 13:01.448
PETER: Great to be thin.
BRIAN: Yup.

13:02.241 --> 13:05.577
You know, there's something
I always wanted to do, Brian.

13:05.661 --> 13:09.373
But I could never do it
because I was so heavy.

13:09.456 --> 13:13.168
But now that I don't weigh so much,
I think I can.

13:13.460 --> 13:16.046
Could you help me do it?

13:16.129 --> 13:17.381
Sure, I'd be honored.

13:17.631 --> 13:20.717
I was wondering if I could put
a little saddle on your back...

13:20.801 --> 13:22.719
...and ride you like a horsy.

13:22.803 --> 13:24.596
Okay. No, I understand.

13:24.680 --> 13:26.306
It's too much. It's okay.

13:31.270 --> 13:34.273
BRIAN: I like Hillary Clinton.
I don't care what anyone says.

13:34.356 --> 13:35.983
Peter, what are you....

13:36.191 --> 13:38.235
I can feel all the bones in your ass!

13:38.485 --> 13:39.736
Come on!

13:45.033 --> 13:46.535
I see you.

13:46.702 --> 13:48.787
[Laughing]

13:49.830 --> 13:52.249
But, Mom, it could change my life!

13:52.332 --> 13:55.502
Meg, for the last time,
you're not getting plastic surgery.

13:55.586 --> 13:59.631
Why not? It's totally safe.
A lot of famous people have done it.

13:59.715 --> 14:02.718
My son, your place is here
in the ice village.

14:02.801 --> 14:04.970
You know nothing of Hollywood
and its ways.

14:05.053 --> 14:07.347
But, Father, I have dreams, and courage...

14:07.431 --> 14:09.683
...and the name
of an excellent cosmetic surgeon.

14:09.766 --> 14:13.103
Fear not. Someday word will reach you
about the success of me...

14:13.187 --> 14:16.106
...the great Eskimo actor,
Jennifer Love Hewitt!

14:17.149 --> 14:19.484
MAN #1: Bring pride to our village!

14:19.568 --> 14:20.819
MAN #2: Send firewood.

14:20.903 --> 14:23.572
She's right, Lois.
Plastic surgery is great!

14:23.655 --> 14:26.116
I want Broderick
to take a look at my nose.

14:26.200 --> 14:28.952
It doesn't matter
if your nose is a little bulbousy...

14:29.036 --> 14:32.915
...or your eyes are too close together,
or your chest is flabby.

14:32.998 --> 14:34.541
You are who you are.

14:35.417 --> 14:37.419
I think I know what you're getting at.

14:40.797 --> 14:42.174
Knock-knock.

14:42.257 --> 14:45.719
Hey, you can't just walk in
here without.... Holy crap, it's Peter!

14:45.886 --> 14:48.388
CHRIS: Dad, you're pretty, like a girl.

14:48.472 --> 14:50.641
You look like a totally different person.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.100
This is crazy!

14:52.184 --> 14:55.020
You walk in here
with your chiseled jaw and your....

14:55.103 --> 14:58.440
Oh, my. I liked you the way you were.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.609
You're not even real anymore.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.319
Did you get a new buttocks?

15:02.402 --> 15:04.488
I had to. My old one had a crack in it.

15:04.571 --> 15:05.572
[Laughing]

15:05.656 --> 15:08.200
I couldn't be more angry with you.

15:08.450 --> 15:10.035
[Moaning]

15:10.827 --> 15:13.080
LOIS: You really let this family down.

15:13.163 --> 15:15.415
We should be embracing
the things God gave us.

15:15.499 --> 15:19.628
Not telling our kids you're not as good
as others because of the way you look.

15:20.671 --> 15:21.797
PETER: Holy crap!

15:30.430 --> 15:32.516
Look. There's a baby in that refuse bin!

15:32.599 --> 15:36.019
Not too close, Barnaby. If you touch it,
the mother won't take it back.

15:36.103 --> 15:37.437
Alley-oop!

15:43.402 --> 15:44.611
Excuse me, sir.

15:44.695 --> 15:47.197
What is a handsome man like you
doing waiting in line?

15:47.281 --> 15:48.866
I need an adult!

15:50.868 --> 15:53.662
Warren Fredericks.
Quahog Beautiful People's Club.

15:53.745 --> 15:57.416
WARREN: Come on in front.
PETER: But people were in front of me.

15:57.499 --> 15:59.710
You haven't been beautiful very long,
have you?

15:59.793 --> 16:02.296
Gorgeous guys like us
don't have to wait in line.

16:02.379 --> 16:05.716
Haven't you noticed? People will do
anything for a beautiful person.

16:05.799 --> 16:07.926
Yeah. You know, come to think of it....

16:08.969 --> 16:12.514
Hi, I'm on a scavenger hunt.
And I need a human foot.

16:12.848 --> 16:16.685
Well, as a rule, I would say no,
but okay, come in.

16:17.603 --> 16:20.397
So this is what?
This for like a school project or some....

16:20.480 --> 16:22.274
[Screaming]

16:22.357 --> 16:25.944
Raul, please take this handsome
gentleman's bags to his car.

16:26.403 --> 16:27.696
PETER: Thank you.

16:29.907 --> 16:33.076
Hey, when you're beautiful,
doors magically open for you.

16:33.160 --> 16:36.371
Actually, it opened because you stepped
on that black rubber square.

16:36.455 --> 16:40.292
Of course, if that wasn't there, it would
open anyway because you're beautiful.

16:40.375 --> 16:41.460
PETER: Wow!

16:45.255 --> 16:47.466
There's a lot of good looking people here.

16:47.549 --> 16:50.177
Of course. This is the
Quahog Beautiful People's Club.

16:50.260 --> 16:52.971
You're our newest member.
Here's your introductory basket.

16:53.055 --> 16:55.349
It's got some scented lotions,
Ferrari sunglasses...

16:55.432 --> 16:57.935
...and of course,
pills to make your bowel movements...

16:58.018 --> 17:00.562
...smell like bakery-fresh cinnamon rolls.

17:04.066 --> 17:05.400

17:10.739 --> 17:12.115
[Creaking]

17:17.538 --> 17:18.622
STEWIE: Damn it!

17:18.705 --> 17:20.916
What happened? Orson fall down?

17:20.999 --> 17:23.585
STEWIE: Shut up! I don't want to hear it!

17:23.669 --> 17:24.837
It serves you right.

17:24.920 --> 17:28.298
You spent all that time taunting Chris,
now you have an eating disorder.

17:28.382 --> 17:29.383
STEWIE: Help me up!

17:29.466 --> 17:32.719
You know I would, but my doctor
advised me against heavy lifting.

17:32.803 --> 17:34.680
STEWIE: Oh, hardy har har.

17:36.390 --> 17:38.433
What the devil are you doing?

17:38.517 --> 17:40.936
Stop it! I'm getting dizzy!

17:41.812 --> 17:42.813
Blast!

17:46.024 --> 17:49.444
Peter, did you paste a new picture
of yourself on our wedding portrait?

17:49.528 --> 17:52.364
-Yeah. I think it looks better.
-You pasted it over me.

17:52.447 --> 17:54.116
PETER: Yeah. I think it looks better.

17:54.199 --> 17:55.617
Have you lost your mind?

17:55.701 --> 17:57.077
Somebody is jealous!

17:57.160 --> 18:01.164
Have you forgotten about Chris?
He needs you to help him exercise.

18:01.248 --> 18:03.625
He finally figured out
how to catch the Twinkie.

18:04.543 --> 18:06.295
I'm turning you into poo!

18:06.587 --> 18:08.797
I'm going down
to The Beautiful People's Club.

18:08.881 --> 18:10.132
I guess I can bring him.

18:10.215 --> 18:13.302
Seeing us all in one place
might give him something to shoot for.

18:13.385 --> 18:16.138
LOIS: The Beautiful People's Club?
I never heard of that.

18:16.221 --> 18:17.681
I can't say anymore.

18:17.764 --> 18:20.934
I'm probably already in trouble
for mentioning it to a....

18:21.018 --> 18:24.563
Well, we call you "normies." Okay, 'bye.

18:29.193 --> 18:30.986
Are you gonna take that?

18:31.653 --> 18:33.488
-Lois!
-What? Oh, Brian.

18:33.572 --> 18:34.573
[Stuttering]

18:34.656 --> 18:37.868
I was seeing if the driveway....

18:37.951 --> 18:39.620
That wasn't even a sentence.

18:39.703 --> 18:41.872
You were ogling Peter
like a horny schoolgirl.

18:41.955 --> 18:43.582
I can't help it!

18:43.665 --> 18:47.794
I know. He's become
a superficial egomaniacal jerk...

18:47.878 --> 18:51.006
...but I've never
been more attracted to him.

18:51.131 --> 18:53.550
Does that make me a bad person?

18:53.634 --> 18:55.594
Yes, it does make you a bad person.

18:58.597 --> 18:59.932
WARREN: Peter, good to see you.

19:00.182 --> 19:03.852
Come with me. I've got a lot of tall,
statuesque people I want you to meet.

19:04.102 --> 19:06.480
-What's that?
-That's my son, Chris.

19:06.563 --> 19:08.857
He can't come in. He's fat.

19:08.941 --> 19:12.528
Let me tell you something, buddy,
if my son can't come in...

19:12.611 --> 19:14.404
...then I'll just come in!

19:14.488 --> 19:16.490
-See you at home.
-But, Dad....

19:16.573 --> 19:19.368
Trust me, Chris.
Sometimes it's better not to fit in.

19:19.535 --> 19:21.870
[Helicopter flying overhead]

19:23.372 --> 19:26.542
You're all stupid.
They'll be looking for Army guys.

19:29.545 --> 19:32.297
CHRIS: Don't look at me! I'm hideous!

19:32.714 --> 19:34.967
LOIS: How could you treat Chris that way?

19:35.050 --> 19:37.302
You know he's self-conscious
about his weight!

19:37.386 --> 19:40.806
What are you getting mad at me for?
He gets his fat from your genes.

19:40.889 --> 19:42.724
Which, by the way, I'm wearing.

19:42.808 --> 19:44.935
I hate what you've become!

19:45.018 --> 19:48.313
Why don't you go back to the doctor
to suck the fat out of your head?

19:48.397 --> 19:50.983
Maybe I will!
And then I'll put it on my feet...

19:51.066 --> 19:54.152
...and skate on Paul Bunyan's
giant skillet to cook his flapjacks!

19:54.236 --> 19:55.779
That doesn't make any sense.

19:55.863 --> 19:58.282
It doesn't have to. I'm beautiful!

19:58.615 --> 20:01.034
You're not welcome here! Go away!

20:01.535 --> 20:03.328
Wow, Chris. Did you lose weight?

20:03.996 --> 20:06.331
Maybe. I've been working out.

20:06.415 --> 20:09.459
You look wicked skinny.
I'm like, jealous.

20:09.626 --> 20:12.713
Thanks, Meg.
I'm jealous of your mustache.

20:12.963 --> 20:15.465
I don't have a mustache, do I?

20:15.549 --> 20:18.385
Oh, honey. It's fine.
It makes you look distinguished.

20:18.468 --> 20:19.720
But, Mom!

20:19.803 --> 20:22.472
I think all my children are beautiful.

20:24.808 --> 20:28.061
Damn you, ice cream. Come to my mouth.

20:28.145 --> 20:30.063
How dare you disobey me.

20:32.024 --> 20:35.569
What are you looking at,
you infantile, stupid....

20:35.986 --> 20:38.572
That's right. Damn you and such.

20:38.655 --> 20:41.158
You can burn in hell.

20:41.241 --> 20:42.242
[Yawning]

20:45.412 --> 20:47.247
She is so jealous.

20:47.331 --> 20:49.082
Of course, I'm beautiful.

20:49.166 --> 20:50.834
I mean, look at me.

20:51.835 --> 20:53.295
How strange....

20:53.420 --> 20:57.925
Should watch road but can't look away.

20:58.717 --> 21:00.469
Too beautiful.

[Peter gulping]

21:22.199 --> 21:24.910
Well, Mr. Griffin,
the bandages are ready to come off.

21:24.993 --> 21:28.080
I think I should tell you,
it's a miracle that you're alive at all.

21:28.163 --> 21:31.708
We did all we can.
But medical science has come just so far.

21:33.460 --> 21:34.461
[Gasping]

21:34.545 --> 21:38.131
And now I will take off this protective
Potato Head mask.

21:38.507 --> 21:40.592
Oh, Peter! You look like you!

21:40.676 --> 21:45.180
I can't believe you're all still standing
by my side after what a jerk I was.

21:45.264 --> 21:47.891
Especially to you. I'm sorry, Chris.

21:47.975 --> 21:49.351
That's okay, Dad.

21:49.434 --> 21:52.646
Well, Peter, I guess you learned
a pretty valuable lesson.

21:52.729 --> 21:53.856
Nope!

21:56.400 --> 21:58.777
[Theme music]
