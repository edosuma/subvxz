WEBVTT

00:06.620 --> 00:09.145
<i>In New York City's
war on crime,</i>

00:09.222 --> 00:11.281
<i>the worst criminal offenders
are pursued</i>

00:11.358 --> 00:13.792
<i>by the detectives
of the Major Case Squad.</i>

00:14.261 --> 00:16.229
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:18.865 --> 00:22.232
What wonderfully idiosyncratic
taste your father has.

00:22.836 --> 00:24.736
He only shopped
when he was drunk,

00:25.038 --> 00:26.801
and he only bought
what made him laugh.

00:26.873 --> 00:30.138
I really have to leave. Is the
silver in the butler's pantry?

00:30.210 --> 00:31.939
Yes. Excuse us.

00:36.283 --> 00:39.741
Colonial silver.
Impressive.

00:41.221 --> 00:44.247
These are the stars
of our collection.

00:44.491 --> 00:48.393
Zodiac spoons.
I've only seen pictures.

00:48.762 --> 00:51.356
They've been in
our family for years.

00:52.599 --> 00:54.999
I'm going to need to do some
research on this hallmark.

00:56.169 --> 00:59.468
Research? I need the
appraisals by tomorrow morning.

01:01.608 --> 01:03.371
My father's very ill.

01:03.443 --> 01:07.243
I'll do the research tonight
at home. It'll be ready in time.

01:08.348 --> 01:12.341
The hallmark's 19th-century
Austrian. You want to take this down?

01:13.487 --> 01:17.480
The letter "A" stands for
Vienna. Where's the rest?

01:18.291 --> 01:19.280
There's more?

01:19.359 --> 01:22.192
There are plates,
dessert spoons, demitasses.

01:22.262 --> 01:24.753
Oh, my God,
where did you see them?

01:26.833 --> 01:28.960
An old client of mine
from Smith Barney.

01:29.035 --> 01:31.902
In fact, I'm playing golf with him
tomorrow, which is why I can't stay.

01:31.972 --> 01:35.840
Don't move. We need to
talk over dinner tonight.

01:38.645 --> 01:42.103
I'm sorry to disturb you. It turns
out I need that appraisal tonight.

01:42.182 --> 01:44.241
Ms. Todman,
I can see you're busy.

01:44.317 --> 01:48.310
I'll email you a picture of that
argyle from the London exhibit.

01:50.724 --> 01:53.852
We had one coffee date and
I never heard from him again.

01:53.927 --> 01:55.155
I swear, meeting men in New York

01:55.228 --> 01:57.423
is like trying to
make friends with ants.

01:59.533 --> 02:00.557
Oh, God.

02:01.168 --> 02:02.192
What?

02:04.538 --> 02:07.336
I thought I recognized an old
boyfriend on Singular Singles.

02:07.407 --> 02:10.705
<i>Hmm. Happens to me all the
time, on America's Most Wanted.</i>

02:12.679 --> 02:14.340
<i>The new appraisals
are all there.</i>

02:14.414 --> 02:16.177
<i>The insurers can
adjust their values.</i>

02:16.416 --> 02:18.247
This one hasn't
been signed

02:18.318 --> 02:20.912
and it's missing the
appraiser's license number.

02:25.058 --> 02:27.891
We can't give out
that information, sorry.

02:31.465 --> 02:33.558
Just give him
this message.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:43.944 --> 02:46.970
I told you to be
back at 10:00.

02:48.181 --> 02:50.240
Give me that thing.
Here you go, Ma.

02:50.317 --> 02:53.047
Watch out.
I am so sorry.

02:58.391 --> 03:01.360
Excuse me. Miss?

03:07.234 --> 03:10.328
Matt, there was a cop at
the corner. Go get him.

04:00.487 --> 04:02.580
Time of death,
maybe a couple of hours ago.

04:02.656 --> 04:06.183
No I.D., no purse. She still
has her watch and earrings.

04:06.660 --> 04:09.925
Lucky for you, the Chief of D has
designated this the monthly hot zone,

04:09.996 --> 04:11.554
so we all
get to pile on.

04:11.798 --> 04:13.060
Gin tonic.

04:13.600 --> 04:14.589
We're passing
her photo around

04:14.668 --> 04:15.999
to local bars
and restaurants.

04:16.469 --> 04:18.903
Looks like you
got it all handled.

04:19.272 --> 04:20.637
Those marks, I mean...

04:20.707 --> 04:22.072
From a chokehold.

04:22.208 --> 04:23.505
Except for the one
on the Adam's apple.

04:23.577 --> 04:24.737
It looks like it
came from the side.

04:24.811 --> 04:26.335
I figure the perp
was sitting next to her.

04:26.680 --> 04:27.772
Someone she trusted.

04:27.847 --> 04:30.111
He hit her, then stepped
behind her to choke her out.

04:30.183 --> 04:31.775
There were gray wool fibers
caught in her earring,

04:31.851 --> 04:33.375
maybe from the perp
when he choked her.

04:33.853 --> 04:34.877
Well...

04:34.955 --> 04:37.048
We'll get out
of your hair.

04:38.458 --> 04:40.722
Anything at all
in her pockets?

04:41.061 --> 04:42.892
Just these.

04:43.263 --> 04:48.462
A jeweler's loupe,
polishing cloth, and this.

04:49.936 --> 04:51.904
She could be in
the jewelry business.

04:52.372 --> 04:54.340
Looks like silver polish.

04:56.776 --> 04:59.540
These numbers
next to these dates,

04:59.613 --> 05:04.243
237 AM, 7886 HK...

05:06.186 --> 05:07.881
Could be auction numbers.

05:11.224 --> 05:13.488
I have no idea what she
was doing in that park.

05:13.560 --> 05:16.290
When I left, she was
still here working.

05:17.364 --> 05:18.626
Do you have a number for her family?

05:18.698 --> 05:21.223
We're gonna
need to call them.

05:21.701 --> 05:23.896
Becks has a sister
in Boston.

05:24.971 --> 05:26.268
Do you know if
she had a boyfriend?

05:27.073 --> 05:28.540
No.

05:28.808 --> 05:30.605
I kept saying to her,
"Don't give up. "

05:31.177 --> 05:32.576
She took your advice.

05:32.646 --> 05:36.275
She logged on to the Singular
Singles website yesterday afternoon.

05:36.349 --> 05:38.044
She only logged on
to the opening screen.

05:38.118 --> 05:40.382
She never actually
cruised the site.

05:41.054 --> 05:43.454
What did she look
at just before?

05:45.058 --> 05:48.425
Interpol Database.
These look familiar?

05:48.895 --> 05:50.419
I wish. They're gorgeous.

05:50.830 --> 05:52.388
Zodiac pattern.

05:54.267 --> 05:57.896
Austrian hallmark. Maybe this
is what she got upset about.

05:57.971 --> 05:58.960
Mmm-hmm.

06:00.373 --> 06:03.308
This is all her work
from the auction house.

06:04.010 --> 06:07.173
There's only one book
on Austrian silver,

06:07.247 --> 06:09.977
but I can't find the hallmark
that was on the plates.

06:10.050 --> 06:14.043
These appraisals are on her own
letterhead. She was moonlighting.

06:16.489 --> 06:18.889
These look like they're
part of the stolen set.

06:19.092 --> 06:21.424
Dessert spoons,
same hallmark.

06:21.494 --> 06:22.483
Hmm.

06:22.896 --> 06:25.626
This must be her notes
on the appraisal.

06:26.032 --> 06:28.159
But no appraisal.

06:28.768 --> 06:30.702
Well, these are dated
from two days ago,

06:30.770 --> 06:33.864
for a Victor Burke, in the
Douglas Manor section of Queens.

06:33.940 --> 06:36.909
The side of the tracks
I never got invited to.

06:39.946 --> 06:43.143
I only met her the one time, when
she appraised my father's collection.

06:43.216 --> 06:45.275
We'd like to talk to your
father about his collection.

06:45.351 --> 06:47.615
No, I'm sorry.
He's too ill.

06:48.121 --> 06:51.921
Well... These spoons, do
you know where he got them?

06:53.626 --> 06:57.255
He's had those for years.
Excuse me?

06:58.732 --> 07:02.896
Styrofoam peanut. It's a packing
material. Are you unpacking or packing?

07:03.636 --> 07:06.901
Packing. Upon his death, we're
sending my father's collection

07:06.973 --> 07:07.997
to a museum in Kansas.

07:08.074 --> 07:12.135
The appraisals, you would have made
copies for the shipping company.

07:12.212 --> 07:14.646
Can we see the one
Ms. Todman did?

07:15.915 --> 07:17.906
When you said you've had
the spoons for years,

07:17.984 --> 07:20.043
you mean before 2001?

07:20.787 --> 07:21.879
Yes.

07:21.955 --> 07:23.980
No, see, those spoons,

07:24.057 --> 07:26.321
<i>along with 44 other
pieces of silverware,</i>

07:26.392 --> 07:29.259
were stolen from a home
in Chicago in 2001.

07:30.096 --> 07:34.760
Ms. Todman, did she happen to
mention that they were stolen?

07:35.301 --> 07:37.394
No. She said
she had to go home

07:37.470 --> 07:39.495
to research the hallmark, that's all.

07:39.839 --> 07:41.773
This is a mistake.
It's gotta be.

07:41.841 --> 07:43.399
Well, maybe
your dad knows.

07:43.777 --> 07:45.244
No, I told you.

07:46.479 --> 07:47.537
Mr. Burke!

07:47.614 --> 07:49.241
My father is too ill.

07:49.849 --> 07:50.873
Geez.

07:50.950 --> 07:52.076
Okay.

07:53.753 --> 07:56.347
By the way, last night... I
was here at my father's bedside.

07:56.422 --> 07:58.447
And he could
verify that, right?

07:58.525 --> 08:00.584
If he weren't too
ill to talk to us?

08:06.032 --> 08:08.660
You have another
peanut on your pants.

08:12.806 --> 08:15.900
Victor Burke's prints turned
up in Ms. Todman's apartment.

08:15.975 --> 08:19.604
Only on her desk. Maybe he stopped
by to pick up his appraisal.

08:19.679 --> 08:21.977
But the signature on the
appraisal is not hers,

08:22.048 --> 08:23.675
and neither is
the license number.

08:23.750 --> 08:24.876
Maybe she wouldn't sign it

08:24.951 --> 08:26.145
because she found out
the goods were stolen.

08:26.219 --> 08:29.154
Burke needs the appraisal
for the insurance.

08:30.089 --> 08:32.649
Maybe he doesn't plan on letting
Daddy's silver get to Kansas,

08:32.725 --> 08:34.317
so he forged
her signature.

08:34.394 --> 08:36.191
Find out if Burke owns
a gray wool sweater.

08:36.529 --> 08:39.054
This is interesting.

08:39.131 --> 08:42.397
The information on the
hallmark is very detailed,

08:43.403 --> 08:46.497
but her books didn't
have any information on it

08:47.040 --> 08:48.940
and there was no record that
she looked it up on her computer,

08:49.008 --> 08:50.134
so there has to be
another source.

08:52.245 --> 08:53.507
Eames.

08:55.381 --> 08:57.906
Thanks. Some guys
have all the luck.

08:58.384 --> 09:01.285
Victor's dad passed away
early this morning.

09:03.623 --> 09:05.147
They think
I murdered my father.

09:05.225 --> 09:08.194
You don't have a choice.
You have to comply.

09:08.261 --> 09:11.526
Mr. Burke's remains are
upstairs. The maid will show you.

09:11.598 --> 09:14.123
Next up, we have a warrant
for those Zodiac spoons.

09:14.200 --> 09:15.758
No! You can't take those!

09:15.869 --> 09:19.361
Give them the spoons, Victor.
We can clear it up later.

09:24.878 --> 09:27.369
They're in here.
I can't believe you people.

09:27.447 --> 09:30.416
Why so upset? The spoons
are going to a museum anyway.

09:30.483 --> 09:32.451
Unless you had
other plans for them.

09:32.518 --> 09:35.351
That's very funny.
I can't find my keys.

09:54.641 --> 09:57.235
I don't think
you're gonna need them.

10:05.151 --> 10:08.086
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

10:08.154 --> 10:09.849
Hey. Easy, easy.

10:09.989 --> 10:12.116
I can't believe that.
Easy.

10:12.659 --> 10:14.149
That's a million dollars'
worth of silver!

10:14.227 --> 10:15.922
Victor, don't say anything.
We'll take care of it.

10:15.995 --> 10:17.087
Oh, my God!

10:17.163 --> 10:18.323
Is he for real?

10:18.464 --> 10:19.522
Absolutely.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.433
He might've planned
to steal them,

10:22.502 --> 10:24.732
but somebody else
beat him to the punch.

10:29.709 --> 10:34.578
Curtain was hiding it. Cut through,
reached in, undid the latch.

10:36.449 --> 10:40.215
It would've taken two trips
to get all the silver.

10:41.554 --> 10:44.284
Each time he would've had to pass
the maid's room without waking her up.

10:44.424 --> 10:45.413
Cool head.

10:45.491 --> 10:46.583
He got sloppy here.

10:47.093 --> 10:51.154
Tripped on the mat, stepped in
cooking grease. I figure a size 12.

10:53.633 --> 10:56.659
The deepest impression's
on the ball of the foot.

10:57.503 --> 10:59.528
That's about five inches
from the tip of the shoe.

10:59.605 --> 11:04.304
He's wearing oversized shoes to
throw us off. Sloppy like a fox.

11:06.446 --> 11:09.609
I'm heartbroken. I have no idea
what happened to the silver.

11:09.682 --> 11:12.776
You were planning to have it
stolen. That's why you were in a rush

11:12.852 --> 11:16.117
to get the new appraisal,
to collect the insurance.

11:16.622 --> 11:18.715
That's not true. You were
in such a rush, Victor,

11:18.791 --> 11:23.228
that you forged the signature,
faked the license number.

11:23.329 --> 11:28.266
Here's the real thing, and
here's your client's botch job.

11:39.212 --> 11:43.546
Okay, I went to her place.

11:43.616 --> 11:46.050
She said there was
a problem with the spoons.

11:46.119 --> 11:49.088
She said they were
part of a larger set.

11:49.155 --> 11:51.623
I didn't care.
I just wanted the appraisal.

11:52.358 --> 11:54.019
The next day I found out
she hadn't signed it.

11:54.093 --> 11:57.654
I called her. She said that
the spoons were stolen goods.

11:58.064 --> 12:01.158
You know, my father was near
death. I had to do something.

12:01.234 --> 12:04.067
And your scheme to
collect insurance money?

12:05.371 --> 12:07.362
I was just gonna take it.

12:08.875 --> 12:11.002
No one even knew my father
had this silver collection.

12:11.077 --> 12:13.170
That's why I hired
a private appraiser.

12:13.279 --> 12:15.406
The information
on the hallmark,

12:15.548 --> 12:18.847
Becks say where she got it?
Maybe another expert?

12:19.318 --> 12:20.649
An expert?

12:21.687 --> 12:24.781
Well, there was
a man at her apartment

12:24.857 --> 12:26.882
who mentioned something
about an argyle.

12:26.993 --> 12:29.188
An argyle.
Gravy boat, right?

12:29.796 --> 12:32.890
Now, the way you said
"expert," maybe you think...

12:33.800 --> 12:36.291
He was more than that? Maybe you
think they were intimate or...

12:36.369 --> 12:40.305
She was freshly showered, and
he seemed anxious to leave.

12:41.574 --> 12:43.303
Sounds about right.

12:44.877 --> 12:46.208
Can't be a lot of
guys in the city

12:46.279 --> 12:48.338
conversant in
argyle gravy boats.

12:49.182 --> 12:53.585
Sorry. I don't think
that he's from this city.

12:54.554 --> 12:55.816
I have...

12:55.922 --> 12:56.911
Just...

12:58.224 --> 13:00.454
The police report.

13:05.498 --> 13:10.026
There. From the Chicago burglary
of the Zodiac silver set.

13:11.604 --> 13:15.040
<i>Now, they connected it
to 46 other cases.</i>

13:16.309 --> 13:19.335
The only thing that
was stolen, silverware.

13:20.513 --> 13:24.472
Now, in one house, the burglar
left a footprint, size 12.

13:25.017 --> 13:28.043
In three cases,
our Chicago burglar

13:29.222 --> 13:33.784
took the hinges off the silver
cabinet, took only the best pieces...

13:33.860 --> 13:35.521
Including the Zodiac spoons.

13:35.595 --> 13:38.120
No wonder Beck's boyfriend
was familiar with the hallmark.

13:38.197 --> 13:40.893
He's the one who stole
them three years ago.

13:40.967 --> 13:43.629
So, she figures out
Victor's spoons are stolen.

13:43.703 --> 13:46.570
She tells her boyfriend.
He gets nervous.

13:46.639 --> 13:49.836
Takes her for a nice
romantic stroll in the park.

13:49.909 --> 13:52.002
I think he lives nearby.

13:52.078 --> 13:54.808
You know, probably
wouldn't rent an apartment.

13:54.981 --> 13:56.608
Guy like this, you know,

13:56.682 --> 13:57.910
you need to be mobile.

13:58.084 --> 13:59.346
Residential hotels.

14:02.688 --> 14:05.953
I'm terrible at faces.
Really don't look at people.

14:08.728 --> 14:11.993
That piece of blue note
paper, what is that?

14:12.265 --> 14:15.359
That's a message for one of
our guests. It's the Harrises.

14:15.434 --> 14:17.026
How long has
it been there?

14:17.703 --> 14:18.795
Couple of days, I think.

14:18.871 --> 14:21.237
And the Harrises
haven't picked it up?

14:21.307 --> 14:24.401
Are they still here?
They haven't checked out.

14:29.382 --> 14:31.282
Can we see the message?

14:43.095 --> 14:44.255
A note in invisible ink.

14:48.134 --> 14:51.695
Becks was looking for him. She
didn't know his room number.

14:52.205 --> 14:54.173
Clerk wouldn't tell her.

14:55.908 --> 14:59.844
So she left this, so she could
watch which slot he put it in.

15:00.513 --> 15:03.676
Smart girl. We'd like to
drop in on the Harrises.

15:06.886 --> 15:08.217
They cleared out.

15:08.287 --> 15:12.189
That's just great. They have an
outstanding balance of $1,160.

15:12.725 --> 15:14.090
When did you
last see them?

15:14.160 --> 15:16.958
Two weeks ago, when I
worked the evening shift.

15:17.029 --> 15:18.326
They go out together?
No.

15:18.397 --> 15:22.231
He'd go out around 8:00, and then
she'd get picked up a little later

15:22.301 --> 15:23.825
by a car service
every night.

15:23.903 --> 15:25.461
All right, thanks.

15:28.574 --> 15:33.011
This guy's sweet, living with a call
girl while stringing Becks along.

15:33.079 --> 15:34.979
He was cultivating Becks.

15:35.581 --> 15:39.847
She had detailed appraisals of
dozens of private silver collections.

15:41.454 --> 15:43.319
Information available
nowhere else.

15:43.389 --> 15:45.357
He's just getting warmed up.

15:46.492 --> 15:47.754
I'm sorry I brought it up.

15:47.827 --> 15:50.193
I'll figure something out. I
just don't want you yelling at me.

15:50.263 --> 15:52.458
It just caught
me off-guard.

15:54.100 --> 15:58.628
Look, this is gonna be a good
thing for us. A reason to be normal.

15:59.405 --> 16:02.499
Really?
Really. I gotta go.

16:05.444 --> 16:09.540
And this is over.
No more smoking, okay?

16:09.615 --> 16:10.980
No, I know.

16:12.952 --> 16:14.715
Be careful, okay?

16:23.262 --> 16:26.163
It's impressive,
seeing them all up there.

16:27.300 --> 16:30.997
He's beaten every kind of alarm
system, every kind of lock.

16:31.837 --> 16:36.137
He's gotten by dogs, guards. In
each case, the owner was home.

16:36.976 --> 16:40.139
They were either sleeping
or watching television.

16:40.746 --> 16:44.512
Those just came in. Two burglaries
last night in Forest Hills.

16:44.583 --> 16:47.416
Well, both of them
are silver collections.

16:48.988 --> 16:50.785
Both Becks-appraised.

16:51.457 --> 16:53.550
That's what those blue pins are? Yeah.

16:53.626 --> 16:57.289
The red ones are houses that he
hit in Chicago three years ago.

16:57.363 --> 17:01.163
Maybe we can do everyone a public
service and take this guy out.

17:01.233 --> 17:03.394
Well, going by
his MO in Chicago,

17:03.469 --> 17:06.836
he hits two or three
houses in one night,

17:06.906 --> 17:09.568
and then changes
neighborhoods.

17:09.875 --> 17:12.435
Two nights later, doubles
back to the first neighborhood.

17:12.511 --> 17:14.479
He's due back in
Burke's neighborhood.

17:14.680 --> 17:16.079
Big area to cover.

17:16.147 --> 17:17.809
He likes houses
that stand alone.

17:18.784 --> 17:24.086
You know, a lot of hedges and tree
covers, one block from each other.

17:24.990 --> 17:28.357
Stays away from corner
houses, empty houses.

17:30.796 --> 17:34.527
Well... He likes to be in the house
with the owner. It's probably...

17:35.501 --> 17:37.628
I don't know, a power thing.

17:38.104 --> 17:42.234
He specializes in 19th and
early 20th century silver,

17:42.942 --> 17:48.471
which narrows it down to
three two-block areas.

17:51.016 --> 17:52.881
Take plenty of coffee.

18:08.100 --> 18:09.727
It's my turn at bat?

18:09.802 --> 18:13.238
It's just after 5:00. We'll
give it another half hour.

18:14.540 --> 18:15.905
Don't you ever sleep?

18:16.208 --> 18:17.607
There's a lot to do.

18:22.348 --> 18:26.079
These are case studies
on psychopathy of burglars.

18:31.490 --> 18:33.287
This hump's
not gonna show.

18:33.359 --> 18:35.759
You don't mind, my guys
would like to go home,

18:35.828 --> 18:38.023
see their kids
off to school.

18:41.534 --> 18:43.866
We all got stiff necks
and nothing to show for it.

18:43.936 --> 18:45.369
The guy never showed up.

18:45.438 --> 18:48.703
Really? Maybe you can explain
this, then. Came in 10 minutes ago.

18:48.774 --> 18:51.937
Mr. DeSimio came home from
an all-night poker game,

18:52.011 --> 18:55.208
found his home burgled
and his family silver gone.

18:56.315 --> 18:59.148
Isn't that four blocks
from your stakeout?

19:00.419 --> 19:03.684
We just got reports he hit
two more houses one block over.

19:03.756 --> 19:06.316
Owners are out of town. The
housekeepers discovered the burglaries

19:06.392 --> 19:09.190
when they showed up
for work this morning.

19:10.129 --> 19:12.120
He took this thing apart.

19:13.365 --> 19:17.802
And stacked all the pieces
in a neat little pile.

19:19.738 --> 19:22.434
This, was it here
before the burglary?

19:22.508 --> 19:26.205
Mr. DeSimio said he forgot to
put it away before he left.

19:26.278 --> 19:30.612
He took the silver but left
the cash. He's making fun of us.

19:31.217 --> 19:33.913
Well, I would, too,
if I was this good.

19:40.893 --> 19:42.554
The houses that
we staked out,

19:42.628 --> 19:46.120
each one had over half a
million dollars in silver.

19:47.032 --> 19:49.227
But the ones that he hit

19:49.301 --> 19:51.292
had less than
a hundred thousand worth.

19:51.437 --> 19:53.462
Maybe he made us
at the stakeout.

19:53.539 --> 19:57.066
Yeah, maybe, but the ones
that he hit were empty houses.

19:59.812 --> 20:04.806
He might be playing it safe, even
if it means a smaller paycheck.

20:06.886 --> 20:08.478
He's changed his MO.

20:08.554 --> 20:10.249
Well, he's not the
only one with surprises.

20:10.456 --> 20:14.222
His girlfriend challenged a bunch
of charges on their hotel bill.

20:14.293 --> 20:16.625
She signed it,
"Mrs. S. Harris. "

20:16.695 --> 20:21.564
She used hotel shorthand for different
expenses. Taxable, non-taxable.

20:21.967 --> 20:23.525
She knows
hotel bookkeeping.

20:23.602 --> 20:26.196
Her night job.
Hotels use night auditors.

20:26.438 --> 20:29.896
And a nice hotel might even
send a car service for her.

20:33.879 --> 20:36.507
She only worked here about
three months, until last week.

20:36.582 --> 20:38.072
She was getting
sick all the time.

20:38.150 --> 20:40.118
She sat here?
Yes, sir.

20:40.219 --> 20:41.686
We need the résumé
she gave you.

20:42.021 --> 20:43.488
I'll get it.

20:45.024 --> 20:46.958
Did you know Sheila had a
boyfriend? She mention that?

20:47.026 --> 20:50.359
No. She didn't talk much,
which I prefer.

21:03.842 --> 21:05.776
She moved the desk
from here?

21:05.911 --> 21:07.845
She wanted it moved
away from the outlets.

21:07.913 --> 21:11.007
She said the smell of
electricity made her sick.

21:11.550 --> 21:13.108
The smell of electricity.

21:13.185 --> 21:15.153
I thought I could
smell moonbeams.

21:15.487 --> 21:20.515
When you were pregnant. Well,
that's why he was playing it safe.

21:21.961 --> 21:23.485
'Cause he wanted to
be there for the baby.

21:23.562 --> 21:25.553
I think I'm gonna cry.

21:26.532 --> 21:30.161
You drew this last night? Now I
know why you never come to bed.

21:30.269 --> 21:34.205
I've got a lot going on. Why?
What's wrong with it?

21:36.308 --> 21:40.369
I just thought we could have a place
of our own. We got enough money.

21:40.479 --> 21:42.879
I don't want to
talk about money.

21:44.483 --> 21:46.110
Eat your salad.

21:46.318 --> 21:47.876
My salad smells like fish.

21:47.987 --> 21:49.682
Everything smells
like fish to you.

21:50.522 --> 21:52.183
Where you going?

21:52.391 --> 21:53.983
I'm gonna tell
them to send up

21:54.059 --> 21:55.583
a bottle of champagne
to the room,

21:55.661 --> 21:57.458
and then we can
watch movies all night.

21:57.529 --> 21:59.463
You know we gotta
pay for all that.

21:59.732 --> 22:03.361
It's our honeymoon.
They'll comp us, believe me.

22:13.078 --> 22:14.739
You see the burglary
report this morning?

22:14.813 --> 22:16.974
It's four nights in a row our
Silver Surfer's been out of action.

22:17.049 --> 22:18.846
His girlfriend quit
her job last week.

22:18.917 --> 22:20.578
They might've left
the jurisdiction.

22:20.819 --> 22:21.843
What are these yellow pins?

22:21.920 --> 22:23.478
We're tracing the
girlfriend's work history

22:23.555 --> 22:25.113
using her social
security number.

22:25.190 --> 22:27.283
She's worked in the same
cities at the same time

22:27.359 --> 22:29.520
he was knocking off
houses in the suburbs.

22:29.595 --> 22:32.393
See, they go back
six years, off and on.

22:32.665 --> 22:35.930
That explains why there's a few
yellow pins off on their own.

22:36.001 --> 22:38.060
What are these?
Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania?

22:38.137 --> 22:39.126
Well,
that's interesting.

22:39.204 --> 22:41.104
Every March for
the last five years

22:41.173 --> 22:44.199
she takes a job at
a Home Emporium there.

22:44.276 --> 22:47.177
She stays a month or two, and
then, you know, she moves on.

22:47.246 --> 22:50.682
I don't see any red pins
nearby. Where was our boy?

22:50.749 --> 22:52.376
Nowhere. MIA.

22:52.918 --> 22:55.785
Maybe they had a fight
and she ran home to mother.

22:55.854 --> 22:59.915
Pennsylvania's nice this time of
year. Bring me back a smoked ham.

23:02.261 --> 23:05.321
Good afternoon. Is Sheila
home, Sheila Bradley?

23:05.898 --> 23:07.058
I don't know
who that is.

23:07.132 --> 23:10.033
She used to work at the Home
Emporium over in Bloomsburg.

23:10.102 --> 23:11.831
She listed this as
her home address.

23:11.904 --> 23:13.166
Somebody's mistaken.

23:13.238 --> 23:15.706
Well, last week, she
used her employee discount

23:15.774 --> 23:18.572
to have some building
supplies delivered here.

23:18.644 --> 23:20.134
I don't know
anything about that.

23:20.212 --> 23:22.112
We have a warrant
for her arrest.

23:22.181 --> 23:24.046
We need to come in
and take a look around.

23:24.183 --> 23:27.346
You got a warrant.
I don't think I can stop you.

23:39.064 --> 23:41.498
She was asleep
in front of the TV.

23:44.169 --> 23:46.501
Ma'am, whoever was
just back here working?

23:46.572 --> 23:50.633
That would be my son, Wesley. I
guess he could be anywhere by now.

24:07.192 --> 24:11.629
All right. Easy. Easy. I just had
some lardass standing on my leg.

24:11.697 --> 24:13.961
You're under arrest,
Mr. Kenderson. For what?

24:14.032 --> 24:17.297
You skipped out on a thousand
dollar hotel bill back in New York.

24:17.369 --> 24:19.234
You didn't pay
our hotel bill?

24:19.304 --> 24:20.669
You never give me any money.

24:20.739 --> 24:22.206
Damn it, Sheila.

24:25.177 --> 24:28.374
It's not as bad as it
looks, Ma. It's no big deal.

24:30.682 --> 24:33.515
How many times you
think she's heard that?

24:40.359 --> 24:42.554
I like that
you're organized.

24:44.062 --> 24:46.656
I guess we're alike
that way, Wesley.

24:48.667 --> 24:51.101
If this is just
about the hotel bill...

24:51.236 --> 24:53.704
You know it's not about
a hotel bill, man.

25:09.688 --> 25:13.920
Detective, this is junk.

25:14.660 --> 25:16.821
It's a plate leftover
from a flea market

25:16.895 --> 25:18.920
I worked in
Goshen last month.

25:24.970 --> 25:27.370
You know,
when a man finds his...

25:28.173 --> 25:31.165
His calling, he doesn't
give it up to sell junk.

25:31.577 --> 25:32.942
My calling?

25:33.545 --> 25:34.910
Master thief.

25:38.417 --> 25:40.715
Wesley John Kenderson.

25:40.786 --> 25:43.653
You burglarized your neighbor's
home when you were 18.

25:43.989 --> 25:45.513
Did six months.

25:47.893 --> 25:51.021
Yeah, I gotta tell you, you don't
look very happy about being there.

25:51.096 --> 25:53.690
It embarrassed my mother.

25:56.001 --> 25:58.026
But all that's in the past.

25:58.403 --> 26:00.200
Well, not too far
in the past.

26:02.541 --> 26:04.509
A year ago,
you did 60 days in Ohio

26:04.576 --> 26:07.010
for possession of
stolen property.

26:07.079 --> 26:09.741
I told the judge I found
those goods at a flea market.

26:09.815 --> 26:14.411
Yeah. A 19th-century Asprey
tea set worth $30,000?

26:14.486 --> 26:17.512
<i>I got lucky. You got
lucky 46 times in Chicago.</i>

26:18.457 --> 26:21.255
Thirty-seven times
in Philadelphia.

26:22.094 --> 26:26.997
Richmond, Baltimore.
Now New York.

26:27.933 --> 26:31.960
Always with the same signature.
Oversized footprint, size 12.

26:36.208 --> 26:38.073
Debris stacked neatly.

26:38.443 --> 26:42.675
I guess it's the evidence of your
unsparing dedication to your craft.

26:43.048 --> 26:46.017
Listen, Wesley, you know,
if you cooperate with us,

26:46.084 --> 26:48.075
the D.A. Will get
the other jurisdictions

26:48.153 --> 26:51.589
to roll all these burglaries
up into one package.

26:54.893 --> 26:59.193
You know, when I got
pinched eight years ago,

27:00.265 --> 27:03.257
a cop told me he'd let
me go if I cut him in.

27:04.136 --> 27:06.832
I told him that I'd
rather do the time.

27:09.041 --> 27:13.444
Well, I mean, if we don't
get the story from you,

27:13.512 --> 27:15.503
we'll get it
from your girlfriend.

27:15.580 --> 27:17.445
Oh, Sheila's my wife now.

27:21.420 --> 27:23.547
Well, hell,
congratulations.

27:27.359 --> 27:31.227
Was that her idea, you know, so
her baby would have your name?

27:31.797 --> 27:36.200
Well, you know women. She wanted
a normal life for the baby.

27:37.102 --> 27:38.763
Geez, what's her dream
of a normal life?

27:38.837 --> 27:41.806
Being cooped up in
a motel room with a kid,

27:41.873 --> 27:43.170
waiting for you
to come home?

27:45.077 --> 27:48.376
Sharing you with other women?
She know about the other women?

27:48.447 --> 27:49.846
About Becks?

27:53.952 --> 27:56.079
I met her
at an auction.

27:56.955 --> 27:59.321
She offered to
help me find a job.

27:59.758 --> 28:01.157
Yeah, but she didn't, because
she wanted a boyfriend.

28:01.226 --> 28:03.091
Is that why
you disappeared?

28:03.662 --> 28:05.391
It was just easier.

28:07.265 --> 28:12.202
Or she figured out
that you were a thief

28:15.073 --> 28:18.008
who stole the Zodiac
spoons in Chicago.

28:18.076 --> 28:21.068
Is that what she's saying?
She's just hurt.

28:22.781 --> 28:26.683
No, geez, I don't know how to
break this to you, Wesley, but...

28:29.855 --> 28:31.379
You killed her.

28:34.526 --> 28:37.359
You broke her windpipe.
You choked her out.

28:40.298 --> 28:41.959
I didn't kill her.

28:43.735 --> 28:47.762
She came to your hotel. You walked
her across the street to the park.

28:47.839 --> 28:51.036
She never knew where I lived.
I was very careful.

28:51.109 --> 28:54.601
Not careful enough. She
dropped this at the front desk.

28:58.083 --> 29:00.779
It was a dodge to
get your room number.

29:05.824 --> 29:09.988
You might feel confident that your
new bride will alibi you on this,

29:11.096 --> 29:14.691
but I think when we charge
her as being an accomplice,

29:16.568 --> 29:19.867
she'll think twice about
raising her baby in prison.

29:27.079 --> 29:28.808
If it's all the same
to you, I'd like to wait

29:28.880 --> 29:31.348
in my holding cell
for my arraignment.

29:33.852 --> 29:36.082
We've been
together six years.

29:36.922 --> 29:40.722
Except for the five months you spent
apart last year. He was in Ohio.

29:40.792 --> 29:42.555
We were going
through a rough patch,

29:42.627 --> 29:44.527
but we talked
every day on the phone.

29:44.763 --> 29:46.731
Even if he was living
with another woman?

29:47.199 --> 29:48.860
He was not!

29:49.868 --> 29:53.269
Well, he got arrested with
her. Didn't he tell you?

29:54.873 --> 29:58.934
She looks like a pro. He likes to
pay for it when he's on his own.

29:59.010 --> 30:00.534
I guess Wesley
can afford it,

30:00.612 --> 30:01.840
<i>sitting on all that money?</i>

30:01.913 --> 30:03.676
<i>What money?</i>

30:05.750 --> 30:10.312
<i>Over the years, he's stolen
about 40 million in silver.</i>

30:10.856 --> 30:13.552
Figure he gets 10 cents on
the dollar from his fence,

30:13.758 --> 30:17.558
and the way he lives, I'll bet
he's sitting on three million.

30:20.899 --> 30:24.357
I told you, he buys and sells
silverware at flea markets.

30:24.436 --> 30:27.269
I know what he makes.
I do his income tax.

30:28.874 --> 30:31.536
Wesley's going down.
You have to cut him loose

30:31.610 --> 30:33.976
or he's taking you
down with him.

30:35.046 --> 30:38.345
Have you ever been in love? You
don't just cut someone loose.

30:38.416 --> 30:42.477
Be in love all you want,
Sheila, but think of your baby.

30:43.855 --> 30:46.517
Wes is totally into being a
father and a good provider.

30:46.591 --> 30:48.786
Wesley's only
into one thing.

30:49.161 --> 30:50.890
He's like my partner,
who wants to be

30:50.962 --> 30:52.953
left alone to do
what he's good at,

30:53.331 --> 30:54.992
catching bad guys.

30:55.667 --> 30:57.294
<i>It's the same with Wesley.</i>

30:57.369 --> 31:01.100
Stealing silver's all he thinks
about, all he's gonna think about.

31:01.206 --> 31:05.142
A year from now, you and that
kid will be only a memory.

31:05.210 --> 31:09.874
You don't know him! He's always
thinking of me. He loves me.

31:12.017 --> 31:15.316
<i>A few weeks ago, he found time
to think about Rebekah Todman.</i>

31:15.520 --> 31:17.488
<i>He was just trying
to get a job out of her.</i>

31:17.556 --> 31:19.615
<i>Didn't you worry
he'd take off with her?</i>

31:19.958 --> 31:23.758
<i>She was rich, she was
smart, she could help him.</i>

31:24.729 --> 31:26.560
<i>You don't
understand about Wes.</i>

31:26.631 --> 31:30.567
You give him a choice between
meatloaf and a prime rib dinner,

31:31.169 --> 31:34.798
and he's gonna choose the meatloaf.
I've seen him do it in Vegas,

31:34.873 --> 31:37.967
even when the prime rib
was, like, five dollars.

31:38.777 --> 31:42.213
I hope you really don't
think of yourself as meatloaf.

31:45.116 --> 31:49.610
You've worked hard all your
life, you've supported yourself.

31:51.823 --> 31:56.021
You see this? A part-time job in
Carlsbad, Swansboro, North Carolina.

31:56.094 --> 31:58.426
You had two jobs
in Carson City.

31:59.864 --> 32:03.163
These towns, they're all
near marine corps bases.

32:03.235 --> 32:05.066
Yeah. My dad
was an E-8, 11 B.

32:05.403 --> 32:07.234
Master Sergeant,
Heavy Operations.

32:08.740 --> 32:10.332
Moved around a lot.

32:10.408 --> 32:12.933
Is that why you were
attracted to Wesley,

32:13.712 --> 32:16.237
because of that
rootless lifestyle?

32:16.314 --> 32:18.839
My dad took good care
of me, same as Wes.

32:19.217 --> 32:20.445
Taught you how to
take care of yourself.

32:20.518 --> 32:23.043
That's the main thing.
My dad's a cop.

32:23.121 --> 32:25.954
He taught me a few moves.
Same as your dad?

32:31.496 --> 32:33.623
I've said all
I want to say.

32:37.869 --> 32:38.995
A couple of
self-defense moves

32:39.070 --> 32:41.004
is all it would have taken
for her to kill Becks.

32:41.706 --> 32:43.196
Unless he
was conning us,

32:43.275 --> 32:44.708
it doesn't appear
that Mr. Kenderson

32:44.776 --> 32:46.300
even knew
Ms. Todman was dead.

32:46.511 --> 32:48.809
Well, some things are
starting to make sense to him.

32:48.880 --> 32:51.075
What? That he's married to a murderer?

32:51.149 --> 32:55.051
Don't stake our case on a career
criminal's sense of decency.

32:55.120 --> 32:59.420
A criminal's career that doesn't
include a single act of violence.

32:59.491 --> 33:03.222
That we know of. Your search turn
up anything at all to link her

33:03.295 --> 33:06.025
to the murder, maybe
a gray wool sweater?

33:06.231 --> 33:07.630
No such luck.

33:07.699 --> 33:10.793
Much as I'd like him to
finger her for the murder,

33:10.869 --> 33:12.894
I'd like her to finger him
for some of these burglaries.

33:12.971 --> 33:15.201
We've got her thinking
about his money.

33:15.273 --> 33:17.901
We don't have forever for them
to pull the trigger on each other.

33:18.109 --> 33:21.408
<i>I can maybe push their
arraignment another 48 hours.</i>

33:23.648 --> 33:27.311
He does come home to visit his
mother at least once a year.

33:27.385 --> 33:29.910
Can't just be for
the peach cobbler.

33:31.923 --> 33:33.754
You won't find any
money hidden here.

33:33.825 --> 33:36.419
Wes doesn't like money. Doesn't
like what it does to people.

33:36.494 --> 33:38.587
He has friends
who got rich?

33:38.663 --> 33:41.257
He went to a preparatory
school on a scholarship.

33:41.333 --> 33:45.895
He never fit in with the children of
privilege. That's what he called them.

33:47.072 --> 33:48.266
Wesley at his graduation.

33:48.340 --> 33:52.106
That's around the time that he
started getting in trouble, isn't it?

33:52.177 --> 33:55.374
He came home with a terrible
chip on his shoulder.

33:55.447 --> 33:58.143
I don't see a picture
of Mr. Kenderson.

34:02.087 --> 34:04.078
Do you think Wesley
would make a good father?

34:04.155 --> 34:06.953
He can do anything
he applies himself to.

34:09.194 --> 34:12.288
Well, you're right about
Wesley, Mrs. Kenderson.

34:13.031 --> 34:15.329
You know,
him applying himself.

34:16.768 --> 34:21.398
The framing is tight. He's
making a bedroom and baby room?

34:21.473 --> 34:22.770
Is that Sheila's idea?

34:22.841 --> 34:24.274
No, it was Wes.

34:24.476 --> 34:25.601
He said he wanted
his child to have

34:25.677 --> 34:27.907
a normal life,
with a house and a yard.

34:29.514 --> 34:31.344
A normal life.
His idea?

34:31.516 --> 34:33.313
Somebody's been
sneaking cigarettes.

34:33.385 --> 34:36.547
There's a jelly jar here full
of cigarettes and a lighter.

34:36.621 --> 34:38.110
Sheila, right?

34:39.924 --> 34:43.087
You'd think she'd want
to take care of herself.

34:43.161 --> 34:44.924
He's very organized.

34:46.697 --> 34:48.255
He ask you to
save these cans?

34:48.333 --> 34:50.266
He won't let me
throw them away.

34:55.473 --> 34:58.067
That path, is that from
him walking into the woods?

34:58.143 --> 35:00.270
I guess so.
He loves nature.

35:00.678 --> 35:01.906
What's back there?

35:01.980 --> 35:03.607
A levee and
an old tractor shed.

35:05.016 --> 35:06.984
I think
we're done here.

35:10.555 --> 35:12.921
This is a thermal
image of the tractor shed

35:12.991 --> 35:15.425
in the woods behind
the Kenderson home.

35:15.994 --> 35:18.861
Wesley turned it
into his personal bank.

35:19.030 --> 35:22.227
Each dot is a coffee can
buried in the dirt floor.

35:22.567 --> 35:24.933
That's a lot of coffee.

35:25.003 --> 35:27.767
We still have to prove that the
money actually belongs to him.

35:27.839 --> 35:29.067
Well, the only
sure way to catch him

35:29.140 --> 35:30.505
is while he's
making a withdrawal.

35:30.775 --> 35:32.538
Could be a long wait.
Maybe not.

35:32.610 --> 35:34.237
We met some very
friendly people

35:34.312 --> 35:37.406
at the Pennsylvania
Department of Public Works.

35:38.016 --> 35:39.347
They came by
this morning.

35:39.417 --> 35:40.509
The man from
Public Works said

35:40.585 --> 35:41.916
they found cracks
in the levee.

35:42.053 --> 35:44.715
They'll be moving their
equipment in, starting tomorrow.

35:44.789 --> 35:48.190
Tomorrow? They mention
anything about the shed?

35:48.259 --> 35:51.251
Just that they'll be parking
their trucks in there.

35:51.329 --> 35:54.389
They said repairs
should take about a year.

35:54.466 --> 35:56.366
The stars
are out tonight.

35:56.501 --> 35:58.401
Since when do you
look at the stars?

35:58.503 --> 36:00.835
It's good to
have you both back.

36:01.806 --> 36:04.741
I hope all those troubles
are behind us now.

36:08.513 --> 36:11.414
If anything happens to us, I
want my mom to take the baby.

36:11.583 --> 36:15.041
Like you taking off to Ohio
and shacking up with some whore?

36:15.119 --> 36:17.349
Why you gotta bring that up?

36:17.422 --> 36:19.686
There's nothing I can do
about the past, is there?

36:19.757 --> 36:21.520
It just made me mad.

36:24.262 --> 36:25.251
Hey...

36:27.632 --> 36:29.532
Nothing's gonna happen.

36:30.001 --> 36:32.902
Everything's gonna be
just like you wanted.

36:54.759 --> 36:56.590
<i>Only about 146 to go.</i>

37:00.632 --> 37:03.430
You know, these are
the straightest rows.

37:04.269 --> 37:08.137
In all things, you are
very, very meticulous.

37:10.575 --> 37:16.912
So, each dot is, what,
$10,000, $20,000?

37:21.019 --> 37:23.249
Looks closer to
$20,000 to me.

37:25.156 --> 37:27.021
Well, all together,
that's quite a nest egg.

37:27.091 --> 37:30.891
I don't think there's a law
against a man burying his savings.

37:30.962 --> 37:34.159
Well, I don't know if the
IRS would agree with that.

37:34.232 --> 37:36.530
You here for a bribe,
Detective?

37:36.601 --> 37:39.468
I'd think I'd rather do my
five years for tax evasion.

37:39.537 --> 37:41.437
Five years can be a
long time for a child

37:41.506 --> 37:43.337
at the mercy of the
wrong kind of person.

37:43.408 --> 37:44.875
Sheila's not what
you think she is.

37:44.943 --> 37:46.570
Yeah?
She's got a good heart.

37:46.644 --> 37:48.509
Where is he?
Is he in here?

37:48.580 --> 37:49.706
There he is.

37:49.847 --> 37:54.750
There's his shovel, and here's
his money. Now you believe me?

37:57.288 --> 37:58.721
It's true!

37:58.790 --> 38:00.155
You were gonna dig
up all your money

38:00.224 --> 38:01.657
and take off on me again, weren't you?

38:01.859 --> 38:03.383
No, I wasn't.

38:03.461 --> 38:04.723
You bastard!

38:04.862 --> 38:06.523
Oh. Hey!
Easy, easy.

38:07.532 --> 38:09.932
I wasn't taking off on you.

38:10.001 --> 38:12.697
I'm looking right at you!
I can see that you're lying!

38:12.770 --> 38:15.068
I'm not lying. They were
gonna park trucks here.

38:15.139 --> 38:16.401
I had to move the money.

38:16.507 --> 38:17.906
Don't waste your breath,
Wesley.

38:17.976 --> 38:19.000
You're not going
to convince her,

38:19.077 --> 38:20.840
you're not going
to convince us,

38:21.579 --> 38:24.309
'cause at the end of the day,
you don't like playing house.

38:24.382 --> 38:25.781
You love stealing too much.

38:25.850 --> 38:27.317
That's not true.

38:27.385 --> 38:28.875
Come on, you love
breaking into the houses

38:28.953 --> 38:30.284
of the children
of privilege, you know,

38:30.355 --> 38:32.220
stealing their family silver,
their legacies,

38:32.290 --> 38:35.191
getting back at
those prep-school kids.

38:35.259 --> 38:38.626
That's what my mom thinks.
I'm through with that life.

38:38.696 --> 38:40.994
You know,
you had so much money

38:42.934 --> 38:46.335
for so long. Why haven't
you given up before this?

38:46.404 --> 38:50.170
Because now he has me and the
baby, everything he ever wanted.

38:50.241 --> 38:51.731
What?

38:53.277 --> 38:57.941
All he wanted? No, he told us having
a normal life, that was your idea.

38:59.150 --> 39:01.641
No, I just want him.

39:01.719 --> 39:04.085
The baby, the picket
fence, he wanted all that.

39:04.155 --> 39:06.487
Funny, he didn't
own up to that.

39:09.160 --> 39:11.287
You can't fight your nature.

39:14.932 --> 39:18.891
You really were gonna run off
and leave me here with your baby.

39:18.970 --> 39:20.562
No, I wasn't.

39:20.638 --> 39:23.072
He's leaving, he's gotta sort
something out with the IRS.

39:23.141 --> 39:24.403
It'll only take
about five years.

39:24.475 --> 39:29.174
Five years, Sheila. You think you
can handle it alone, with a kid?

39:30.581 --> 39:31.673
Hey.

39:33.084 --> 39:34.813
You could live with
Wesley's mom, huh?

39:34.886 --> 39:37.411
Maybe get a job full-time
at the Home Emporium.

39:37.488 --> 39:41.754
Look, his mother hates me! Forget
it. I'm not having this baby.

39:41.826 --> 39:44.260
I swear to God, if you
do anything to that kid...

39:44.328 --> 39:47.491
She's already
doing something to it.

39:47.999 --> 39:51.230
We found her stash of
smokes in the backyard.

39:53.304 --> 39:58.264
Geez, Sheila, don't you
care for that kid at all?

39:59.243 --> 40:02.235
So what? It's over.
I can do whatever I want.

40:03.381 --> 40:06.544
Do you know where she
can't do whatever she wants?

40:06.617 --> 40:08.710
The New York State Prison. They
don't allow smoking there anymore.

40:08.786 --> 40:10.219
They even have
maternity wards.

40:10.288 --> 40:12.256
What are you
talking about?

40:12.323 --> 40:13.756
You know now what
she did to Becks.

40:13.825 --> 40:15.349
I didn't do anything.
I never even met her.

40:15.426 --> 40:19.692
She was alone at the hotel, Becks
showed up. Becks made a scene.

40:22.967 --> 40:25.094
Sheila, the mother of your
child, she calmed her down,

40:25.169 --> 40:26.466
then she took her
for a walk in the park,

40:26.537 --> 40:28.266
and then she killed her
with her bare hands. Oh!

40:28.339 --> 40:30.102
Wes, don't listen
to them, honey.

40:30.241 --> 40:32.835
Because Becks was gonna
spoil everything for her.

40:32.910 --> 40:36.744
Now imagine what she would do to
your child if she got mad enough,

40:36.814 --> 40:39.214
a child that she
already resents.

40:41.486 --> 40:43.681
Wes, that would never happen.

40:46.524 --> 40:49.288
Wes, Wes, don't. Don't.

40:52.730 --> 40:55.164
Sheila was in
the room that night.

40:58.069 --> 41:00.401
I know because I called her.

41:01.305 --> 41:03.466
Why are you
telling them lies?

41:03.541 --> 41:06.271
What was she wearing
that night, you remember?

41:06.344 --> 41:09.780
Something gray.
A sweater, wool sweater.

41:10.515 --> 41:15.009
Get off me. I wasn't
alone. You were with me.

41:16.921 --> 41:18.889
You know I didn't do it.

41:18.956 --> 41:20.583
We were sitting around,
we were talking about

41:20.658 --> 41:23.092
how wonderful it was going
to be when the baby was born,

41:23.161 --> 41:26.153
how wonderful it would
be to have a family.

41:26.230 --> 41:30.963
Wes, we were together. Just tell
them that, Wes, that we were together.

41:32.103 --> 41:33.297
You tell them, Wes.

41:33.371 --> 41:34.861
Come on. How about it, Wesley? Come on,

41:34.939 --> 41:36.736
why don't you tell us?

41:37.308 --> 41:41.142
Come on. Tell us how we know
you weren't with her in the room?

41:49.253 --> 41:51.448
Because I was doing
a job in Saddle Rock.

41:51.522 --> 41:54.548
A Johan Rohde silver
service set for 12.

41:55.259 --> 41:57.523
I did that job,
and I did all the others.

41:57.595 --> 41:58.584
What are you doing?

41:58.663 --> 42:01.655
You killed that woman
for no reason.

42:01.766 --> 42:06.430
Because she was gonna go to the
cops! She was gonna turn you in!

42:06.938 --> 42:09.065
Well, you should've let her.

42:09.607 --> 42:11.768
You're under arrest,
Sheila.

42:15.613 --> 42:18.673
Why can't you do
one thing for me?

42:19.784 --> 42:22.082
I have done
everything for you.

42:35.833 --> 42:37.733
It's your turn, Wesley.

42:38.369 --> 42:41.395
I need a favor
before you bring me in.

42:47.645 --> 42:50.580
Don't worry. We'll be
here when you get out.

42:58.356 --> 43:01.792
This is the last time we'll
meet like this, Detective.

43:06.931 --> 43:08.159
Hope so.

43:09.567 --> 43:11.865
Hope is for suckers,
Detective.
