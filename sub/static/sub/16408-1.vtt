Ooh, Carrie

03:52.332 --> 03:53.398
And she did,
she did, she did.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.566
She looked like somebody--

03:56.503 --> 03:58.370

your fucking tongue,

03:58.372 --> 04:00.305
'cause I have

Fucking cracker!

04:01.709 --> 04:04.443

04:08.249 --> 04:09.881
-shit, shit, shit.
-I see your nasty ass.

Yeah, yeah,

04:13.320 --> 04:14.586

04:14.588 --> 04:15.821
I'll be there
in a fucking hour.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.488
Don't fuck me over, okay?

04:17.491 --> 04:19.524
Carrie, I will break
the fucking door down.

04:19.526 --> 04:20.826
Fucking white
cracker bitch...

04:25.632 --> 04:26.832
Ooh,

04:26.834 --> 04:28.500
You fuckin' stupid...

04:30.436 --> 04:32.537
Don't you know
i got shit to do, bitch?

04:32.539 --> 04:35.340
Yeah, you'd better chill
with that shit,

04:35.342 --> 04:37.976
don't you fucking throw that
at me.

04:37.978 --> 04:39.978
Don't you know I will wipe
your honky ass up, bitch?

04:39.980 --> 04:41.613
Cum dumpster bitch.

04:41.615 --> 04:42.848
Crazy ass white bitch,

04:42.850 --> 04:44.316
all skinny,
throwing up and shit.

04:44.318 --> 04:45.917
Who the fuck
does that shit?

04:45.919 --> 04:47.819
You ain't never gonna have
an ass like this, bitch!

04:47.821 --> 04:49.721
Never!

04:54.894 --> 04:56.295
Who the hell are you?

04:56.297 --> 04:57.963
Yeah, excuse you, too.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.467
I don't like your face.

05:04.704 --> 05:08.874
Okay, boys,
where was I?

05:08.876 --> 05:12.044
Mama's gonna take care
of all you nasty suckers.

05:12.046 --> 05:13.879
And by the time
I'm done with y'all,

05:13.881 --> 05:18.950
y'all gonna be some
dirty ass wet noodles.

05:18.952 --> 05:20.752
You motherfuckers
want to see me play

05:20.754 --> 05:21.787
with this right?

05:23.390 --> 05:25.490
Well, since
you're all platinum members

05:25.492 --> 05:27.759
of pleasure's paradise,

05:27.761 --> 05:29.695
you motherfuckers

05:29.697 --> 05:34.466
are gonna get
a look-and-see.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.903
Oh, yes.

05:37.905 --> 05:39.071
Oh!

05:42.609 --> 05:45.410
Oh, yeah,
oh, I'm about to squirt.

05:45.412 --> 05:48.113
I'm gonna give it to you
in the style of an orangutan.

05:48.115 --> 05:50.782
Oh, yes!
Yes!

05:50.784 --> 05:54.519
I'm gonna squirt!
Oh!

05:54.521 --> 05:57.956
Oh, I'm gonna give you
the punch of a donkey!

05:57.958 --> 05:59.424
Oh!

06:11.504 --> 06:13.605
What the fuck is going on
around here?

06:13.607 --> 06:16.975
Â¡Ay, "cariba"!
Buenos dias, mamacita!

06:16.977 --> 06:18.377
Shut up!

06:18.379 --> 06:19.611
Have you not seen
all the people

06:19.613 --> 06:20.846
fucking parading
around the house?

06:20.848 --> 06:22.581
Have you noticed
that your nose

06:22.583 --> 06:23.815
is having
a heavy flow day?

06:23.817 --> 06:25.016
Oh, you did,
'cause you jammed

06:25.018 --> 06:27.486
a tampon up there,
good for you!

06:27.488 --> 06:28.887
Shut the fuck up,
all right?

06:28.889 --> 06:30.822
Your breath smells
like a fucking slave ship.

06:30.824 --> 06:31.823
Wow!

06:32.859 --> 06:34.393
Oh, fuck!

06:34.395 --> 06:35.761
Look, you've lived here
long enough,

06:35.763 --> 06:37.596
you know pretty
much anything goes.

06:37.598 --> 06:39.965
Really?
What the fuck is that?

06:39.967 --> 06:42.467
Ah, relax.
It's for my new indie film.

06:42.469 --> 06:44.436
-Gonna be hot! Pa-pow!
-Who raised you?

06:44.438 --> 06:46.605
-I mean, seriously.
-My mom, okay?

06:46.607 --> 06:48.507
I had a very nice upbringing,
thank you.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.809
Listen, you scratch my back,
I'll scratch yours.

06:50.811 --> 06:52.711
Was that you vacuuming
at like, 5:00 am?

06:52.713 --> 06:54.045
You know what?
Eat me, gator.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.680
Nobody scratches
anything for me around here,

06:55.682 --> 06:56.882
so fuck off, okay?

06:56.884 --> 06:58.617
Well, maybe
if you had better skin,

06:58.619 --> 07:00.018
we'd be more willing
to scratch things for you.

07:01.954 --> 07:04.623
Shit.

07:08.161 --> 07:09.861
It's just
a natural reaction

07:09.863 --> 07:11.596
I've had
ever since I was little.

07:13.633 --> 07:16.001
Every time mama
comes real good,

07:16.003 --> 07:17.836
I cry, that's all.

07:19.739 --> 07:23.542
That's it
for pleasure's paradise today.

07:23.544 --> 07:27.078
I'll see all you
dirty motherfuckers tomorrow.

07:32.852 --> 07:36.488
--Whoopsie.

07:36.490 --> 07:38.457
Shit.

07:41.861 --> 07:43.728
Grow some courage.

07:43.730 --> 07:46.031
Always hiding
behind your mask.

07:46.033 --> 07:47.699
Tough horny guy
"curry stick"

07:47.701 --> 07:49.534
- with a long schlong.

07:49.536 --> 07:51.536
How is my little son
doing?

07:51.538 --> 07:53.672
Have you been able
to find a job

07:53.674 --> 07:56.007
with that beautiful,
shiny American degree?

07:56.009 --> 07:58.076
Why are you sweating?

07:58.078 --> 08:00.078
The house is a little hot.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.581
That is all,
that's why I'm sweating.

08:02.583 --> 08:05.584
I'm still freelancing,
web coding

08:05.586 --> 08:08.019
and trying to find
steady work.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.955
But I must
talk to you later, huh?

08:09.957 --> 08:11.156
Why are you rushing me?

08:11.158 --> 08:14.693
Please, papa.
I need more time.

08:14.695 --> 08:15.961
It's really hot.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.696
-More time?
-I need to clean.

08:17.698 --> 08:20.065
Huh, you want to live
like a transient forever?

08:20.067 --> 08:22.067
No, I will not let you
live like that.

08:22.069 --> 08:24.503
You will live like
a very good Indian
hard-working boy.

08:24.505 --> 08:27.138
American culture is not like
Indian culture, papa.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.107
That is why I'm saying
American culture

08:29.109 --> 08:30.775
is very different
from Indian culture.

08:30.777 --> 08:32.010
Indian culture
is very good culture.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.879
Two more months,
no more, that is it.

08:33.881 --> 08:35.746
Yes, papa.

08:35.749 --> 08:38.116
And one more thing.

08:38.118 --> 08:41.653
How is that
American woman?

08:41.655 --> 08:44.623
I understand American woman
very good with the mouth.

08:44.625 --> 08:45.724
Huh?

08:45.726 --> 08:48.693
No hands?
Your mother--

08:48.695 --> 08:49.961
not very good
with the mouth.

08:49.963 --> 08:53.031
Bite sometime.
Eyes pop out, not good.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.033
-Papa, please.
-What happen?

08:55.035 --> 08:56.635
Your eyes pop out?

09:00.273 --> 09:04.042
Don't be shy, ranjit,
i see the way you look at me.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.977
You nasty.

09:21.294 --> 09:23.128
Ranjit, what up?

09:23.130 --> 09:26.831
Dude, I finally figured out
how to make my fingers Dutch.

09:26.833 --> 09:30.135
You hungry?
Want some yum-yums?

09:30.137 --> 09:33.271
Stupid huta.
That's disgusting.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.073
Oh, god,

09:35.075 --> 09:37.609
things are not settling well
from last night.

09:37.611 --> 09:40.111
Where I come from,
people do not burp this way

09:40.113 --> 09:42.147
in front of others.

09:42.149 --> 09:43.915
You are a dirty pashu.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.584
Wait, what's pashu?

09:45.586 --> 09:49.087
Pashu,
an animal, a beast,

09:49.089 --> 09:51.056
a brute.

09:51.058 --> 09:52.824
That is so sweet.

09:52.826 --> 09:55.727
I should get that
tattooed on my heart.

09:55.729 --> 09:56.828
Pashu.

09:56.830 --> 10:00.699
-You are worthless.
-Mm-hmm.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.200
Where's my coffee?

10:02.202 --> 10:04.302
Sorry, dude,
i had a production meeting

10:04.304 --> 10:06.605
this morning
and I was tired.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.840
Needed to drink it all.

10:08.842 --> 10:13.011
What the fuck, pashu?
This is expensive coffee, man.

10:13.013 --> 10:16.615
-Wasn't that good.
-I'm tired of you
taking advantage of my things.

10:16.617 --> 10:18.083
Name four things.

10:18.085 --> 10:20.852
I buy rice,
and you're burning the rice.

10:20.854 --> 10:23.922
-One time.
-I buy curry, and you are
burning the curry.

10:23.924 --> 10:25.357
You're right,
that one's on me.

10:25.359 --> 10:27.959
-That one was my fault.
-My coffee's from India.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.260
Look, your coffee,

10:29.262 --> 10:31.096
I'll buy you some more
tomorrow, okay?

10:31.098 --> 10:33.965
--Good god, this guy is crazy.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.101
-Who?
-That black guy, Tyrell.

10:36.103 --> 10:37.702
Why he gotta be black, huh?

10:37.704 --> 10:39.237
He's got a name.

10:39.239 --> 10:41.172
I don't go around calling you
brown guy ranjit.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.941
Because he's black.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.876
I'm gonna call you
brown guy ranjit, then.

10:44.878 --> 10:47.879
Fuck you, pashu,
i mean, who labels everything?

10:47.881 --> 10:51.249
By name, taste,
spoilage dated,

10:51.251 --> 10:52.884
perfectly matching
containers?

10:52.886 --> 10:55.253
Have you seen him open a door?

10:55.255 --> 10:56.788
Guys, guys,
good morning, good morning,

10:56.790 --> 10:58.423
-good morning.
-Good morning.

10:58.425 --> 10:59.924
Hi! Can you please
do me a favor?

10:59.926 --> 11:01.159
If you're going
to talk about me,

11:01.161 --> 11:03.161
-just do it to my face.
-Fair enough.

11:03.163 --> 11:06.131
And can you please,
please not touch my things?

11:06.133 --> 11:08.767
Especially you, gator,
with your filthy hands.

11:08.769 --> 11:13.705
Well, excuse me
and my filthy hands.

11:13.707 --> 11:16.041
Calm down, Tyrell.
We're just playing around.

11:16.043 --> 11:18.143
Yeah, man,
just playing around,

11:18.145 --> 11:20.145
it's not like
you're the only person

11:20.147 --> 11:21.913
on the entire planet

11:21.915 --> 11:24.115
who uses a handkerchief
to touch his weenie.

11:24.117 --> 11:25.316
All right,
let's just be honest.

11:25.318 --> 11:26.951
Just because
my state of cleanliness

11:26.953 --> 11:28.186
is on a higher level
of consciousness

11:28.188 --> 11:29.721
than both
you two neanderthals,

11:29.723 --> 11:30.922
it's gonna protect me
from bacteria

11:30.924 --> 11:33.158
eating me
from the inside out.

11:33.160 --> 11:36.094
Did you know
that warmth and moisture

11:36.096 --> 11:38.396
are the key components
to bacterial growth?

11:38.398 --> 11:40.365
Hmm? Have you ever heard of
salmonella?

11:40.367 --> 11:43.401
E. Coli?
Listeria?

11:43.403 --> 11:45.136
Bro, the bottom line

11:45.138 --> 11:47.105
is that even
a kitchen counter

11:47.107 --> 11:50.442
has 50 times
more bacteria on it

11:50.444 --> 11:51.943
than a toilet seat.

11:51.945 --> 11:55.413
Not mine.
My Booty's pretty clean.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.482
-I sit down to pee.
-I know.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.484
What?
You think that's weird?

11:59.486 --> 12:00.919
Ask him how he poops.

12:00.921 --> 12:01.953
How do you shit?

12:01.955 --> 12:04.122
I use a squatty potty.

12:04.124 --> 12:06.725
You know it really comes out
silky and smooth.

12:06.727 --> 12:07.959
That's what
you keep telling me.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.360
But that's not the point.

12:09.362 --> 12:10.895
If the earth opened up
and beelzebub hit you

12:10.897 --> 12:12.197
with fire and brimstone,

12:12.199 --> 12:14.299
you better believe
that I would be licking

12:14.301 --> 12:16.768
a toilet seat
way before I would lick

12:16.770 --> 12:18.103
a kitchen cutting board.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.771
-That's fucked up, dude.
-No, no, no, no.

12:19.773 --> 12:22.407
And I'm not done.
Did you also know--

12:22.409 --> 12:26.111
look at this--
that a kitchen sponge

12:26.113 --> 12:28.847
is one of the most
bacterially infested items

12:28.849 --> 12:29.848
in the entire household?

12:29.850 --> 12:31.516
A single bacterial cell

12:31.518 --> 12:34.085
can multiply into
over 80 million cells

12:34.087 --> 12:35.420
in 24 hours.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.489
That is some serious
"fuck-you-up" shit,

12:37.491 --> 12:40.425
so while you guys
are running around,

12:40.427 --> 12:43.228
scratching your balls
and rubbing your asses

12:43.230 --> 12:44.829
and touching
the kitchen sponge,

12:44.831 --> 12:47.265
I will keep my sanitizer
and I will be safe.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.968
And while you
two little germies

12:49.970 --> 12:52.771
are crying bloody mercy,
pissing out of every single

12:52.773 --> 12:54.439
little baby orifice
in your body,

12:54.441 --> 12:57.142
dehydrated
as a fuckin' arab,

12:57.144 --> 12:58.443
I will be okay.

12:58.445 --> 12:59.844
So, do me a favor

12:59.846 --> 13:02.347
and keep your hands
off my shit!

13:02.349 --> 13:04.549
What the hell
are you pencil pricks

13:04.551 --> 13:06.284
-hemming and hawing about?
-This is very sad.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.286
You brown-nosing,
circle-jerking teabaggers

13:08.288 --> 13:09.420
make some coffee yet?

13:09.422 --> 13:11.389
My Stein is dry.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.358
We would, but Mr. snuff film
drank it all.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.326
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
you touched my tupperware

13:15.328 --> 13:16.928
and you're a snitch?

13:16.930 --> 13:18.463
--That's why your mama

13:18.465 --> 13:20.064
has three teeth.

13:20.066 --> 13:24.202
Huh? One in her mouth,
and two in her pocket.

13:24.204 --> 13:26.304
-What's my mother
got to do with any--
-cut it out!

13:28.175 --> 13:31.409
I am tired of playing
momma dearest around here,

13:31.411 --> 13:33.111
so you ball-slappers
best make nice

13:33.113 --> 13:37.048
or I'll whip out
the metal hangers!

13:37.050 --> 13:40.585
Ranjit,
here's ten bucks.

13:40.587 --> 13:43.888
Go get us all some coffee,
and none of that cheap shit,

13:43.890 --> 13:45.990
I want something nice
that they enslave people

13:45.992 --> 13:47.392
in south America for.

13:47.394 --> 13:51.029
And keep your mitts
off people's shit!

13:51.031 --> 13:52.397
- Why me? He--

13:52.399 --> 13:54.999
cap it!

13:55.001 --> 13:57.402
"Speed your way"
easy chairs,

13:57.404 --> 13:59.170
your hope
for elderly scooters.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.406
This is clarelle,
how can I help you?

14:06.046 --> 14:08.913
It's a bit of a shitter,
but it's got potential.

14:08.915 --> 14:12.483
It's kinda shitty.
Fuckin' shitty.

14:12.485 --> 14:14.052
You're looking at the star
of fashion week

14:14.054 --> 14:15.486
if you can pull this off.

14:15.488 --> 14:17.922
-Yeah, pull that shit all off.
-High ceilings.

14:17.924 --> 14:20.325
-But we don't have any color.
Hello!
-Calm down, price.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.093
Why is it always me?

14:22.095 --> 14:23.494
Come on, I'll show you
why we really came here.

14:23.496 --> 14:24.629
There's four bedrooms
down the hall

14:24.631 --> 14:26.331
that aren't even
being used,

14:26.333 --> 14:27.632
and wait till
you guys see this.

14:33.606 --> 14:36.541
- Okay,
pull her arms back.

14:36.543 --> 14:41.446
Yeah, that's good.
That's how we like it.

14:41.448 --> 14:45.216
Mmm-hmm.
Now arch your back, baby.

14:45.218 --> 14:48.086
Arch your back.

14:48.088 --> 14:51.356
Now ride him.

14:51.358 --> 14:52.991
Pull out slow.

14:52.993 --> 14:54.626
Slower!

14:55.661 --> 14:57.662
Slower!

14:59.531 --> 15:02.133
And punch!

15:02.135 --> 15:05.003
Cut!
God damn it, cut!

15:05.005 --> 15:08.539
And what is this?
Amateur day?

15:08.541 --> 15:11.576
And what is that?
Huh?

15:11.578 --> 15:15.513
Your dick is flapping around
like cock snot.

15:17.449 --> 15:21.052
Hello!
Anybody home?

15:21.054 --> 15:23.388
Pleasure,
do me a favor

15:23.390 --> 15:25.056
and get into makeup

15:25.058 --> 15:28.159
while I talk to silly putty
super schlong over here.

15:28.161 --> 15:30.261
'Cause your face
look like shit.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.096
What you say,
motherfucker?

15:34.133 --> 15:37.969
Now listen here,
miss ghetto fab,

15:37.971 --> 15:40.271
and listen good.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.507
Now I don't wanna hear
any flim flam

15:42.509 --> 15:44.208
coming out of your mouth,

15:44.210 --> 15:46.244
'cause you're fucking
with your money,

15:46.246 --> 15:50.048
and more importantly,
you're fucking with my money,

15:50.050 --> 15:52.650
and I don't take
too kindly to that shit.

15:52.652 --> 15:57.455
Now, you're the star
of this fucking show,

15:57.457 --> 16:00.425
and if it was up to me,
I'd bury your head

16:00.427 --> 16:04.162
in a mound of pillows,
and unlucky for me

16:04.164 --> 16:09.033
my bosses didn't hire me
to shoot "ass pounders 254,"

16:09.035 --> 16:13.638
so, taking
your beat-up face

16:13.640 --> 16:16.341
and burying it
in a mound of pillows

16:16.343 --> 16:18.743
isn't exactly an option.

16:18.745 --> 16:21.980
Take your bootylicious ass
to makeup,

16:21.982 --> 16:26.150
don't pass, go,
collect $200,

16:26.152 --> 16:28.219
till I fucking say so!

16:28.221 --> 16:32.056
Makeup!
Fix her fuckin' gorilla chin.

16:32.058 --> 16:35.493
-I need a money shot!
-I don't like to see her
treated this way.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.395
Dude,
she's a porn chick,

16:37.397 --> 16:40.498
she takes platoons of penises
in her butt for a paycheck.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.167
I don't care.
She's still a person.

16:43.169 --> 16:45.737
Hey!
One fucking voice!

16:48.107 --> 16:50.708
Where you goin', punjab?

16:50.710 --> 16:53.177
Know what?
Fuck you, man.

16:53.179 --> 16:56.347
Don't talk
about my people.

16:56.349 --> 17:00.685
I don't have to take this shit
anymore, okay?

17:02.756 --> 17:04.722
That was hot.

17:04.723 --> 17:06.357
Now that that's settled.

17:06.358 --> 17:10.194
-I'd fuck him.
-Hey, assy.

17:10.195 --> 17:12.630
My name is azeebo.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.565
Oh, I know what
they call you.

17:14.567 --> 17:17.234
I write
your two dollar contracts.

17:17.237 --> 17:19.704
Hey, hey, there are
a lot of people around.

17:25.310 --> 17:27.244
You think I give a fuck?

17:27.247 --> 17:28.579
What's my name?

17:28.581 --> 17:31.082
Mike mix under thunder.

17:31.084 --> 17:34.652
What's my name,
down syndrome dick?

17:34.654 --> 17:36.421
Mike mix under thunder.

17:36.423 --> 17:40.525
Say it like you're getting
your ass hole licked.

17:40.527 --> 17:43.461
Mike mix under thunder!

17:43.463 --> 17:46.230
Yes! Now get used
to that six syllable name.

17:46.232 --> 17:49.834
You know why I get
a six syllable name?

17:49.836 --> 17:52.103
'Cause
I'm fucking successful.

17:52.105 --> 17:54.138
So, remember that sound,

17:54.140 --> 17:55.807
because I can make
or break your career

17:55.809 --> 17:58.776
just like that,
and all you'll hear

17:58.778 --> 18:03.414
is the sound
of Mike mix under thunder

18:03.416 --> 18:05.183
fucking you in the ass

18:05.185 --> 18:06.451
unless you get
that black rhino

18:06.453 --> 18:07.452
to turn to steel.

18:07.454 --> 18:08.619
You got me?

18:08.621 --> 18:09.754
Yes.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.622
Hey, fluffer!

18:11.624 --> 18:14.459
Mouth, dick, go!

18:14.461 --> 18:17.462
Okay, everybody,
take five.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.330
Come here, mufasa.

18:19.332 --> 18:21.532
My name is azeebo!

18:21.534 --> 18:23.801
Whatever, zebra.

18:23.803 --> 18:26.637
Zebra?
This is racial profiling.

18:26.639 --> 18:27.805
I'm not happy

18:27.807 --> 18:29.173
with these
working conditions--

18:29.175 --> 18:32.710
oh, oh, oh.

18:32.712 --> 18:35.213
That's good.

18:35.215 --> 18:37.215
What do you think?

18:39.351 --> 18:40.618
This is more like it.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.720
I like it.
I like it a lot.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.622
Okay.

18:46.825 --> 18:48.793
Stage here.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.395
Got to check
the breaker box
for secondary power.

18:51.397 --> 18:53.598
We've got serious capacity
here.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.133
Vip area down there.

18:55.135 --> 18:56.834
Yes, baby.
Can do.

18:56.836 --> 18:59.170
-Glitter.
-Bruce, what about security?

18:59.172 --> 19:00.304
Just the usual, man.

19:00.306 --> 19:01.439
It's going deep.

19:01.441 --> 19:03.307
Okay, price, on the dial.

19:03.309 --> 19:05.309
I want you to reach out
to all the social networks.

19:05.311 --> 19:06.544
We got a new venue, guys.

19:06.546 --> 19:09.247
-Get on that dial, bitch.
-On it.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.349
Hey, there, get up.
Let me take a look at you.

19:11.351 --> 19:12.917
Do you perform?

19:12.919 --> 19:15.153
-I...
-And what's with the mask?

19:15.155 --> 19:17.388
Uh...

19:17.390 --> 19:21.392
If-- if you can smell sex,
then sex is airborne.

19:21.394 --> 19:23.694
You can see it on the couch
and some on his skin

19:23.696 --> 19:25.229
and I can maybe
smell it on your breath.

19:25.231 --> 19:27.298
-Do you like to fuck?
-I don't--

19:27.300 --> 19:28.900
'cause I got
some pretty hot ass here.

19:28.902 --> 19:30.234
Yeah, she's hot.

19:30.236 --> 19:31.736
Yeah, no,
i can see it now.

19:31.738 --> 19:33.337
Look it.
"Ebony rising."

19:33.339 --> 19:34.672
--Fuck, yeah.

19:34.674 --> 19:38.776
Ah, ah, ah, ah.
Pole vaultin' the moon.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.611
You've got good throw.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.713
I can make it
a interracial thing.

19:42.715 --> 19:45.416
- But I don't pole vault.
- I didn't even make varsity.

19:45.418 --> 19:47.351
-Crystal.
-I-- no.

19:47.353 --> 19:49.420
-Get your white ass over here.
-That's-- yeah, that's--

19:49.422 --> 19:51.422
-yes, Mike?
-Hi.

19:51.424 --> 19:52.790
Suck his cock.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.559
Hey, there, big winner.

19:54.561 --> 19:55.860
Gator, gator, ah!

19:55.862 --> 19:58.362
Okay, okay,
armadillo, armadillo.

19:58.364 --> 20:00.498
-Camp, camp, camp.
-What are you, a "fage"?

20:00.500 --> 20:01.799
No.

20:01.801 --> 20:04.635
-Hey, David.
-It's slurp and burp.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.804
God, you're so loud.

20:06.806 --> 20:08.573
What are you doing? No!

20:08.575 --> 20:10.441
Can I play
with the big winner?

20:10.443 --> 20:11.976
No, you can't play
with the big winner.

20:11.978 --> 20:13.744
-I need some help, gator.
-Yep, solution right here.

20:13.746 --> 20:15.479
I love blowjobs.
I love 'em.

20:15.481 --> 20:17.448
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

20:17.450 --> 20:19.250
Let's go! Let's go!
I am ready, Mike.

20:19.252 --> 20:21.586
-Just give it to me straight.
-I am strong like spear.

20:21.588 --> 20:23.888
-It's too many germs.
-Let me get this right.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.257
You are turning down
getting some

20:26.259 --> 20:29.827
of the greatest head
of your life

20:29.829 --> 20:31.562
from one
of the hottest girls

20:31.564 --> 20:32.830
-in my library--
-it's nice to meet you.

20:32.832 --> 20:34.599
...because you
don't like germs?

20:36.436 --> 20:38.669
Yeah, that's--
that pretty much sums it up.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.504
Well, you better get
used to it,

20:40.506 --> 20:43.608
you pencil-poker
piece of pussy lint!

20:43.610 --> 20:46.310
Welcome to L.A.!

20:47.413 --> 20:49.714
Oh, yes, Mike.
I am ready.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.415
First a.D.,
can I talk straight

20:51.417 --> 20:52.383
to the talent?

20:55.354 --> 20:56.921
Oh.

21:00.025 --> 21:03.628
Grow some fucking balls.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.596
"Welcome to L.A."

21:10.936 --> 21:12.937
Look,
there's one more thing.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.640
There's this old lady,
clarelle, who manages
this place.

21:15.642 --> 21:16.974
I don't think
she's gonna be cool

21:16.976 --> 21:18.776
with us having a party here
last minute.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.411
I'll deal with
the roommates, but...

21:20.413 --> 21:22.046
Don't tell me you dragged me
all the way here

21:22.048 --> 21:23.881
to ghetto valley to tell me
that it's not gonna work.

21:23.883 --> 21:25.683
I'm giving you $2,000

21:25.685 --> 21:27.718
and enough coke
to melt your face.

21:27.720 --> 21:30.321
-Face, bitch.
-Let me explain something
to you.

21:30.323 --> 21:32.456
I don't care about ravers.
I don't care about music.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.558
And I don't give
a fuck about people.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.827
What I care about
is my money and my time,

21:36.829 --> 21:38.763
so don't fuck
with my money or my time.

21:38.765 --> 21:40.998
In about three hours,
I'm on a plane to Miami.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.633
If you don't come through,

21:42.635 --> 21:44.869
you're gonna face a shitstorm
of unimaginable.

21:44.871 --> 21:47.338
So, now what are you gonna do
about this old lady, clarelle?

21:47.340 --> 21:48.572
I don't know.

21:48.574 --> 21:52.009
Can we knock her out
or something?

21:52.011 --> 21:54.312
How old is she?

21:54.314 --> 21:57.915
-Sixty or 70?
-Fuck.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.984
We can't fuck her up.
We can knock her out, though.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.619
Oh, every day at 6:00,

22:01.621 --> 22:04.388
she goes out back
and she waters her flowers.

22:04.390 --> 22:08.025
-Fuck, I'll just
chloroform the bitch.
-Okay, everything's a go.

22:08.027 --> 22:10.428
Ooh, cocktails.

22:10.430 --> 22:11.896
Ah, fuck it.

22:11.898 --> 22:13.731
I'm just gonna inject
that bitch with acid.

22:13.733 --> 22:15.466
Have that bitch
seeing rainbows.

22:15.468 --> 22:16.967
Jesus, I don't want
to kill her.

22:16.969 --> 22:18.703
Shut the fuck up, bitch.
We're not gonna kill her.

22:18.705 --> 22:19.804
We're just gonna put her
to sleep.

22:19.806 --> 22:21.072
And, on that note,

22:21.074 --> 22:23.007
we're gonna set up
and break down.

22:23.009 --> 22:24.942
By the time she wakes up,
everything will be back
to normal.

22:24.944 --> 22:26.711
You get your gig
in cash, bitch.

22:26.713 --> 22:28.879
Gig in motherfuckin' cash.

22:28.881 --> 22:30.881
Will you shut the fuck up?
Seriously.

22:30.883 --> 22:32.917
Come on, dig, bitch.

22:32.919 --> 22:35.753
All right, look, you guys.

22:35.755 --> 22:37.655
We're gonna go out
the same way we came in.

22:37.657 --> 22:39.056
She's the old lady
that's standing out front.

22:39.058 --> 22:40.624
You can't miss her.

22:40.626 --> 22:42.893
Bruce, give me a bump.
For the love of god.

22:42.895 --> 22:44.795
Oh, yeah, you want
some of Mr. moist?

22:44.797 --> 22:46.630
-Just give me some.
-Want my dick?

22:46.632 --> 22:47.998
Shut up,
just give it to me.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.934
Say you want
my dick, bitch.

22:49.936 --> 22:51.869
Say it.

22:51.871 --> 22:54.438
-Say it.
-I want your coke.

22:58.710 --> 22:59.877
Like that shit?

23:03.648 --> 23:04.915
All right.

23:07.686 --> 23:09.920
Okay, a deal's a deal,
all right?

23:09.922 --> 23:11.722
And if anything
goes wrong,

23:11.724 --> 23:13.457
I'm gonna cut off
your fucking balls

23:13.459 --> 23:14.658
and I don't owe shit,

23:14.660 --> 23:16.060
you broken record
motherfucker.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.528
Now get the fuck
outta here.

23:17.530 --> 23:19.163
And that goes for you,
too, scooter.

23:19.165 --> 23:21.399
Fucking bitch.

23:21.401 --> 23:23.501
Isn't she saucy?

23:26.438 --> 23:29.006
Ranjit?
Something I can do for you?

23:29.008 --> 23:32.009
Hi.

23:32.011 --> 23:36.647
Huh, I was just looking
for something.

23:36.649 --> 23:38.182
You know, something.

23:38.184 --> 23:40.084
Laundry room's
down the hall, bro.

23:40.086 --> 23:41.752
Yes.

23:41.754 --> 23:44.155
Yes, the laundry room
is down the hallway,

23:44.157 --> 23:47.992
but I was admiring
your, uh, uh,

23:47.994 --> 23:51.162
unique film antiquities
and glorious memorabilia.

23:52.832 --> 23:55.800
You know, you have
a lot of space here.

23:55.802 --> 23:57.201
You know, you could probably
milk a cow.

23:57.203 --> 23:58.769
It's nice.

23:58.771 --> 24:00.004
Yeah, my old man's
a cinematographer.

24:00.006 --> 24:01.772
I'm lactose intolerant.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.207
But, you know what,
let's cut out this first date

24:03.209 --> 24:04.675
chitchat bullshit.

24:04.677 --> 24:05.910
What the fuck
are you doing in here?

24:05.912 --> 24:08.479
Okay, pashu.

24:08.481 --> 24:11.115
I'm angry and I'm pissed

24:11.117 --> 24:13.017
and I'm wanting
to hurt that director,

24:13.019 --> 24:15.586
and I know you had some things
in your room

24:15.588 --> 24:18.489
and I'm looking for something
to beat him with.

24:20.625 --> 24:22.159
You know what happened
to the last person

24:22.161 --> 24:24.562
that went rummaging around
through my stuff?

24:26.465 --> 24:29.867
Let's just say...

24:29.869 --> 24:32.470
I'm still on medication.

24:36.242 --> 24:39.944
Do you know why
they call me gator, ranjit?

24:44.249 --> 24:46.183
It's because
I'm hard to tame.

24:46.185 --> 24:49.620
Please, pashu, no, no.

24:53.725 --> 24:57.127
Oh, man!
Got you!

24:57.129 --> 24:58.796
Oh, you should see
your face right now.

24:58.798 --> 25:00.130
I wish you could.

25:00.132 --> 25:03.701
It is so stupid-looking.
You look like a hostage.

25:03.703 --> 25:05.236
You look like
you're really mad at me.

25:05.238 --> 25:07.071
And you look stupid.

25:08.074 --> 25:09.874
Crazy fucking pashu.

25:09.876 --> 25:12.176
You're awesome, dude.
You're amazing.

25:12.178 --> 25:16.180
You're like a fucking
curry dahmer.

25:16.182 --> 25:17.982
- Yes.
- -Quiet on the set!

25:17.984 --> 25:20.951
You know what?
I'm sorry. Yep, you got it.

25:20.953 --> 25:23.821
Shh, listen.
Don't worry about that guy.

25:23.823 --> 25:24.989
- Okay?

25:24.991 --> 25:26.957
You proved
your point with him.

25:26.959 --> 25:29.693
I never knew
you had so much heart.

25:29.695 --> 25:31.262
Come in here.
Get over here.

25:32.899 --> 25:34.732
Yes,
booby traps everywhere.

25:34.734 --> 25:38.168
There's no treading
in gator's house.

25:38.170 --> 25:40.237
You are
completely unhinged.

25:40.239 --> 25:42.306
You-- you are a sociopath.

25:42.308 --> 25:44.542
No, I'm just kidding.
Don't hurt me, please.

25:44.544 --> 25:46.877
Listen, there's a lot of girls
getting dicks slapped

25:46.879 --> 25:48.245
on their foreheads
out there.

25:48.247 --> 25:49.980
I want to see
what I can get on this guy.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.048
Put it
on the Internet later.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.716
Try and make us
some money.

25:52.718 --> 25:54.852
Make yourself at home.
You break it, you buy it.

25:54.854 --> 25:57.187
--Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Look at me. Look at me.

25:57.189 --> 25:59.223
I am coming! I am coming!

25:59.225 --> 26:02.192
This is why they call me
the black rhino!

26:02.194 --> 26:05.229
- This is for Botswana!

26:05.231 --> 26:08.632
Cut! God damn it, cut!

26:08.634 --> 26:10.334
That's the fucking
money shot.

26:10.336 --> 26:13.137
Holy dick roll.
What the fuck did you eat?

26:13.139 --> 26:14.939
There he is.

26:14.941 --> 26:16.607
Pleasure, I don't give
a hootenanny

26:16.609 --> 26:18.108
what you do
in your own damn room,

26:18.110 --> 26:20.177
but the living room
is community property.

26:20.179 --> 26:22.746
-Hi, ma'am.
-Don't you ma'am me.
I run this house.

26:22.748 --> 26:24.782
So, you better get
your fresh-out-of-film-school

26:24.784 --> 26:26.350
wish-you-had-a-better-job
stuck-in-a-porn

26:26.352 --> 26:28.218
peacock feathers
the hell out of my way.

26:28.220 --> 26:30.254
It's all good.
This is gonna be
a big movie for me.

26:30.256 --> 26:32.656
Yesterday you said you were
doing a photo shoot,

26:32.658 --> 26:34.158
not shooting
a goddamn porn.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.026
I'm writing you up.
I'm telling Harold.

26:36.028 --> 26:38.062
-Now, where is he?
-He is the guy.

26:38.064 --> 26:41.198
Now, you listen here,
you two-bit crackerjack.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.300
I like nothing more
than some good,

26:43.302 --> 26:46.670
old huffin' and puffin',
so I support your industry,

26:46.672 --> 26:48.906
but what
i will not support

26:48.908 --> 26:52.776
is your two-inch penis
running around my house

26:52.778 --> 26:55.713
insulting my tenants
with more arrogance

26:55.715 --> 26:58.048
than a Kentucky drunk
with a Napoleon complex!

27:04.089 --> 27:06.657
Peanut butter sassafras!
Ah, holy shit!

27:06.659 --> 27:08.859
-What's with the plastic bag?
-I was worried
he was gonna bleed.

27:08.861 --> 27:10.294
Do you have
a handkerchief?

27:10.296 --> 27:11.695
Everybody out.

27:11.697 --> 27:12.730
And get this asshole
out of here

27:12.732 --> 27:14.832
before he wakes up.

27:14.834 --> 27:16.967
-Clarelle--
-i don't want to hear it.
I'm writing you up.

27:16.969 --> 27:19.703
All I do is try
to look out for you kids.

27:19.705 --> 27:22.039
And you sure as hell
don't make it easy for me.

27:29.247 --> 27:31.815
--Fuck.

27:31.817 --> 27:33.784
Fuck this.
I'm going back
into construction.

27:33.786 --> 27:36.687
Oh, god.
That smells like donkey piss.

27:36.689 --> 27:39.423
Any time, shit, otherwise,
i wouldn't be able to see you.

27:39.425 --> 27:41.392
Fuck you, cream pie.
Get the fuck out of my face.

27:41.394 --> 27:42.726
You wanna fight, midnight?

27:42.728 --> 27:44.962
'Kay, Jesus Christ.

27:44.964 --> 27:47.331
I don't even need zoom
on you girls.

27:47.333 --> 27:49.867
Hello.
I'm gator.

27:49.869 --> 27:54.438
Yeah, like a gator.

27:54.440 --> 27:55.973
All right.

27:55.975 --> 28:00.444
He's hot. Grr.

28:00.446 --> 28:02.146
Gators don't go grr.

28:02.148 --> 28:05.783
They go rr.

28:05.785 --> 28:08.185
Hey.

28:10.288 --> 28:13.023
That was nice,
what you said about how people

28:13.025 --> 28:15.259
treat me and stuff.

28:15.261 --> 28:18.729
Thanks
for sticking up for me.

28:18.731 --> 28:20.898
You're like my phula.

28:20.900 --> 28:22.900
The what?

28:22.902 --> 28:26.370
In my culture,
phula means flower.

28:26.372 --> 28:28.372
To me, you are like that.

28:28.374 --> 28:30.808
Oh, come here.

28:41.853 --> 28:43.087
Careful, careful,
careful, careful.

28:44.890 --> 28:46.824
What up, Joe Frazier?

28:46.826 --> 28:48.826
Dude, dope cross.
I didn't even see you coming.

28:48.828 --> 28:50.861
-Thanks, gator.
-Yeah.

28:50.863 --> 28:52.763
-You think
it's broken, clarelle?
-Yeah, it's broken.

28:52.765 --> 28:54.465
Will you put
that damn camera away?

28:54.467 --> 28:56.934
No can do, sorry.

28:56.936 --> 28:58.969
We'll wrap it
at the articular disc

28:58.971 --> 29:01.105
and give you a splint.

29:01.107 --> 29:02.506
You'll be fine, okay?

29:02.508 --> 29:05.209
Gator, grab a bag
of frozen veggies

29:05.211 --> 29:06.410
and wrap it in a towel.

29:06.412 --> 29:07.911
Yes, ma'am.

29:07.913 --> 29:11.448
I'll go outside,
make sure bozo leaves.

29:11.450 --> 29:12.850
Hurry.

29:12.852 --> 29:13.984
Carrie, you gotta see this.

29:13.986 --> 29:15.519
Check this out.

29:15.521 --> 29:17.187
-Fuckin' hard, man.
-I totally missed the punch,

29:17.189 --> 29:18.288
but I totally got the fall.

29:18.290 --> 29:21.158
Ready?
Three, two, boom.

29:21.160 --> 29:23.761
I don't fucking care.
You're so annoying.

29:23.763 --> 29:25.062
"You're so annoying."

29:27.833 --> 29:29.333
Move.

29:30.969 --> 29:32.202
Tell your little cronies

29:32.204 --> 29:34.905
that the flowers
are around back.

29:37.442 --> 29:39.843
Thank you.

29:39.845 --> 29:42.446
That's a down payment,
pussy cat.

29:42.448 --> 29:44.047
Okay, ew.

29:44.049 --> 29:46.150
Get the fuck off me
and leave.

29:46.152 --> 29:50.120
Let's go.

29:50.122 --> 29:52.356
We'll see.

30:01.166 --> 30:02.833
Fuckers.

30:03.868 --> 30:06.170
My room, now.

30:06.172 --> 30:08.939
Look, I don't know
what you have planned,

30:08.941 --> 30:10.507
and, frankly,
i don't care.

30:10.509 --> 30:12.075
Odds are, clarelle's
not siding with you,

30:12.077 --> 30:13.844
and scooter is bad news.

30:13.846 --> 30:16.180
Coming from me,
that's a pretty big deal.

30:16.182 --> 30:17.548
If you want this thing
to go off,

30:17.550 --> 30:19.483
you need my help
and I want half.

30:19.485 --> 30:21.318
Fuck you, gator.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.220
All right, remember
your little weed
growing operation

30:23.222 --> 30:24.221
you had in here?

30:24.223 --> 30:25.222
Payback, fucker.

30:25.224 --> 30:26.390
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

30:26.392 --> 30:27.591
Okay, well,
go ahead and call

30:27.593 --> 30:28.926
your little boy toy
and tell him

30:28.928 --> 30:30.060
that his party's off.

30:30.062 --> 30:33.163
-Clarelle!
-All right, look.

30:33.165 --> 30:34.398
I'll give you a third.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.966
Half.

30:35.968 --> 30:37.534
You know, you may think
your fucking hot shit

30:37.536 --> 30:39.403
around here 'cause
you're the little handyman

30:39.405 --> 30:41.238
and clarelle's favorite
and everything,

30:41.240 --> 30:43.140
but don't fuckin' forget
that outside of this house,

30:43.142 --> 30:45.075
you ain't fuckin' shit,
you weird little fuck.

30:45.077 --> 30:46.343
Oh, pfft.

30:46.345 --> 30:47.578
I am the coolest dude
in this house

30:47.580 --> 30:49.146
-and you know that.
-Okay.

30:49.148 --> 30:51.315
But do not piss me off,
little miss thing.

30:51.317 --> 30:52.616
Because it'll be
a bad payday.

30:52.618 --> 30:54.184
And I know that the face

30:54.186 --> 30:55.986
and all this is how you
make your money,

30:55.988 --> 30:58.155
so I'd hate to fuck
that up, too.

30:58.157 --> 30:59.289
Are you threatening me?

30:59.291 --> 31:01.892
Call it what you like,
darling.

31:01.894 --> 31:03.093
Half.

31:03.095 --> 31:06.063
Sugar pie, honey bunch.

31:06.065 --> 31:07.397
You know, fuck you, gator.
Fuck you.

31:07.399 --> 31:08.599
All right?

31:08.601 --> 31:10.067
I have been
in this fucking town

31:10.069 --> 31:11.301
for four fucking years

31:11.303 --> 31:13.303
doing some really
degrading shit,

31:13.305 --> 31:15.005
taking some really
fucked up jobs

31:15.007 --> 31:17.407
just to get anywhere,
all right?

31:17.409 --> 31:19.443
Now, I finally feel
like I have a shot.

31:19.445 --> 31:21.178
This deal could get me
on a hot runway

31:21.180 --> 31:22.646
that I need to be on.

31:22.648 --> 31:25.182
Get the exposure
that I finally need, you know?

31:26.951 --> 31:29.887
I just--
i can't go back.

31:29.889 --> 31:34.591
I can't go back
to the fuckin' fields

31:34.593 --> 31:37.895
and the trailer parks
and the beer drinking rednecks

31:37.897 --> 31:39.997
who just fuck me for fun

31:39.999 --> 31:43.600
so that they can
go and tell their friends.

31:43.602 --> 31:47.137
I won't do it, all right?
I need this.

31:47.139 --> 31:49.006
I can't handle
this fuckin' town

31:49.008 --> 31:50.574
and the fucking rejection
any longer.

31:50.576 --> 31:53.043
I just need to feel like
I'm doing something,

31:53.045 --> 31:55.479
like I'm worth something,
you know?

31:57.148 --> 32:01.018
I can't fucking fail now,
all right?

32:01.020 --> 32:02.653
Ew, are you crying?

32:02.655 --> 32:05.222
Yeah, fuck you, dude.

32:05.224 --> 32:06.657
I'm having
a fucking breakdown here.

32:06.659 --> 32:09.026
I need
your fucking help, okay?

32:17.068 --> 32:19.670
What about clarelle?

32:21.406 --> 32:23.407
Scooter said he was
gonna take care of it.

32:23.409 --> 32:26.276
It'll be fine.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.512
And you believe that?

32:33.718 --> 32:35.552
This is fucked up.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.259
I've, uh...

32:42.261 --> 32:46.330
Been here, well,
about ten years now.

32:46.332 --> 32:48.398
Don't let
too many people in here.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.701
Mm, thanks for the invite.

32:53.205 --> 32:54.671
Is that you onstage?

32:54.673 --> 32:56.373
Oh, yeah.

32:58.110 --> 33:00.477
Wow, you look amazing.

33:00.479 --> 33:03.547
Oh, that was
the good old days.

33:03.549 --> 33:05.549
Ran in the circles
with the greats

33:05.551 --> 33:08.251
from the glory days
of off Broadway.

33:08.253 --> 33:11.355
Years I spent in New York
doing understudy work

33:11.357 --> 33:15.225
and walk-ons from everything
from brecht to Chekhov.

33:16.627 --> 33:19.196
-Chekhov?
-Mm-hmm.

33:19.198 --> 33:22.265
I played trofimov
in my third year.

33:22.267 --> 33:26.636
Oh, you were an idealist.

33:26.638 --> 33:29.373
-I played Anya in '74.
-I was.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.308
The critics loved me.

33:31.310 --> 33:35.078
It was gonna be
my break to Broadway.

33:35.080 --> 33:37.147
So, what happened?

33:37.149 --> 33:39.116
What happens
to so many starlets

33:39.118 --> 33:42.486
and wild-hearted artists.

33:42.488 --> 33:45.689
We fall in love.
I got pregnant.

33:45.691 --> 33:48.658
Had a miscarriage.

33:48.660 --> 33:51.194
After the miscarriage,

33:51.196 --> 33:53.563
the only thing
that healed him was booze,

33:53.565 --> 33:55.265
and when
he found the bottle,

33:55.267 --> 33:59.269
the thing that healed me
were ice packs and bandages.

33:59.271 --> 34:00.337
I'm really sorry.

34:00.339 --> 34:03.173
Oh, I was
a wild one, too.

34:03.175 --> 34:06.810
In this biz,
it's hard to step out

34:06.812 --> 34:08.478
once you're already in.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.679
Men have all the power,
right or wrong,

34:10.681 --> 34:14.217
and women...

34:14.219 --> 34:15.585
They're easily forgotten.

34:15.587 --> 34:21.525
So, I got up and moved
to L.A. in '77.

34:22.693 --> 34:24.494
Weren't you afraid?

34:24.496 --> 34:26.496
Sure, I was.

34:26.498 --> 34:28.297
But I was more afraid
of not making it,

34:28.300 --> 34:32.302
of never winning
that statue.

34:32.304 --> 34:36.840
More afraid
of failing myself.

34:36.842 --> 34:39.775
What are you afraid of?

34:39.777 --> 34:41.710
Struggle.

34:44.748 --> 34:48.385
Whether or not I...

34:48.387 --> 34:52.489
Think I could be
good enough.

34:52.491 --> 34:54.591
I guess I'm also afraid
of whether I can get over

34:54.592 --> 34:56.493
my own issues...

34:57.728 --> 35:00.464
And actually do it.

35:00.466 --> 35:03.300
Yeah, I...

35:03.302 --> 35:07.204
I am afraid.

35:07.206 --> 35:10.440
The fact
that you know that...

35:10.442 --> 35:13.276
Puts you ahead
of the game.

35:13.278 --> 35:16.379
You know, I may never
have gotten my obie

35:16.381 --> 35:21.685
or my Tony or my Oscar.

35:21.687 --> 35:27.290
But I was in it
and I found glory.

35:27.292 --> 35:30.861
And nobody can take that
away from me.

35:33.498 --> 35:35.632
Well, that's enough
of that crap.

35:35.634 --> 35:38.368
I've got to go and tend
to my flowers.

35:38.370 --> 35:42.739
By the way...

35:42.741 --> 35:45.609
Take this.

35:45.611 --> 35:49.513
I have no use
for it anymore.

35:49.515 --> 35:52.315
-What is it?
-Sand.

35:52.317 --> 35:53.750
From the backstage bags

35:53.752 --> 35:55.685
of my first leading role
off-Broadway.

35:55.687 --> 35:58.388
And don't go putting
that sterilizer all over it.

35:58.390 --> 36:00.757
That's
your first assignment.

36:03.361 --> 36:05.562
Not--

36:05.564 --> 36:07.464
not all,

36:07.466 --> 36:10.667
but some grit is good.

36:10.669 --> 36:12.469
Yes, ma'am.

36:12.471 --> 36:14.337
Now get outta here.

36:14.339 --> 36:16.907
Go on.

36:20.212 --> 36:25.182
-I really can't--
-I'm an old lady and I can't
take too many visitors.

36:30.221 --> 36:31.888
Thanks...

36:31.890 --> 36:33.456
Get.

36:33.458 --> 36:34.591
...for everything.

36:48.372 --> 36:50.540
What happened, Paul?

36:56.280 --> 36:58.315
Clarelle,
there you are.

36:58.317 --> 37:01.551
Jeez, you are about as hard
to get conference with
as the pope.

37:01.553 --> 37:03.353
Listen, got a lot of things
going on this month,

37:03.355 --> 37:04.955
which, by the way,
I'm gonna be a little late

37:04.957 --> 37:06.923
-on rent again.
-Gator, I don't want
to hear it.

37:06.925 --> 37:09.326
I've had your back
for the past three months,

37:09.328 --> 37:10.894
and you know Harold's
a Jew.

37:10.896 --> 37:13.263
So, there's only
so far I can go.

37:13.265 --> 37:14.898
And don't forget,
i only run this shack.

37:14.900 --> 37:16.866
Clarelle, wait a minute.

37:16.868 --> 37:18.368
I've been keeping up
on plumbing,

37:18.370 --> 37:19.736
I've been keeping up
on drywall.

37:19.738 --> 37:21.738
I have a whole list
of things that I need

37:21.740 --> 37:23.240
to get this place tip-top.

37:23.242 --> 37:24.708
Gator, kiss my patootie.

37:24.710 --> 37:26.843
The walls need fillin',
the toilets are busted.

37:26.845 --> 37:29.546
Your only job here
is to fix this damn house,

37:29.548 --> 37:30.880
and that pays your rent.

37:30.882 --> 37:32.616
Nobody even uses
those toilets anyway.

37:32.618 --> 37:34.284
They're all filled up
with poo.

37:34.286 --> 37:36.253
Well, maybe somebody'd
take a shit in there

37:36.255 --> 37:37.787
if they were white
and working.

37:37.789 --> 37:41.992
I know I told your mother
I'd take care of you.

37:41.994 --> 37:44.694
That's what godmothers
are for.

37:44.696 --> 37:46.730
Your mother's
like a sister to me.

37:46.732 --> 37:50.367
I'd do anything
for her and you.

37:50.369 --> 37:52.402
But I can't keep
this umbilical cord

37:52.404 --> 37:53.703
attached forever,

37:53.705 --> 37:56.573
so tomorrow I need $800
out of you

37:56.575 --> 37:59.276
or I'm serving you
eviction papers.

37:59.278 --> 38:01.044
Clarelle,
how can you expect--

38:01.046 --> 38:02.779
do you think
Janet and Gary

38:02.781 --> 38:05.882
would be proud
of what their son's become?

38:05.884 --> 38:08.018
It's time for you
to man up.

38:11.689 --> 38:15.292
It breaks my heart.

38:15.294 --> 38:19.696
I love you like a son.

38:19.698 --> 38:23.833
When you-- when you
were a teenager...

38:25.469 --> 38:28.638
I always thought
you'd be great.

38:31.375 --> 38:34.944
Well, there's still time
for that.

38:34.946 --> 38:37.080
Now, not another word.

38:37.082 --> 38:39.716
I've got to go
and tend to my flowers.

39:42.981 --> 39:46.082
Who is it?

39:46.084 --> 39:47.751
Hey, ren-ren.

39:47.753 --> 39:49.753
Oh.

39:49.755 --> 39:52.088
Hello.
Please come in.

39:55.493 --> 39:56.926
Wow.

39:56.928 --> 40:00.964
Your room smells...

40:00.966 --> 40:03.133
Really good in here.

40:03.135 --> 40:05.402
It's very tech-y
and stuff.

40:05.404 --> 40:07.537
So, how can I help you,
Carrie?

40:07.539 --> 40:09.539
I have a favor
to ask of you.

40:09.541 --> 40:11.074
So, I'm throwing
a party later.

40:11.076 --> 40:12.575
Oh, I really like parties.

40:12.577 --> 40:13.643
You know,
my father in India,

40:13.645 --> 40:15.412
he's a really good dancer.

40:15.414 --> 40:17.514
He does
this bhangra dance thing.
He's a--

40:17.516 --> 40:19.516
yeah, okay, ranjit,
we all have a dad.

40:19.518 --> 40:20.617
Jesus.

40:20.619 --> 40:22.585
Anyway,
what I need you to do

40:22.587 --> 40:24.621
for the party,
don't tell anybody

40:24.623 --> 40:26.556
and please
don't do anything stupid

40:26.558 --> 40:28.124
when my friends are here.

40:28.126 --> 40:31.828
And also don't tell clarelle.
Can you do that for me?

40:31.830 --> 40:34.097
What do I get in return?

40:34.099 --> 40:38.101
I thought maybe
we could work out a deal, hmm?

40:38.103 --> 40:40.103
Oh, yes.

40:40.105 --> 40:42.605
I'm really liking this.

40:42.607 --> 40:44.607
-Oh, god.
-Yeah?

40:44.609 --> 40:46.576
Creamy and American
and white.

40:46.578 --> 40:48.578
Mm.

40:48.580 --> 40:50.914
Okay, so,
we have a deal, then?

40:50.916 --> 40:53.216
Maybe later
we'll have a little fun? Hmm?

40:53.218 --> 40:56.019
What kind of fun,
my wild snow leopard?

40:57.789 --> 41:00.690
Fun
that you will never forget.

41:00.692 --> 41:03.026
-Oh. Mm.
-Oh, my god.

41:03.028 --> 41:05.495
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

41:05.497 --> 41:07.864
You have to wait.
Till later.

41:07.866 --> 41:11.201
Hmm, what's wrong,
kitty cat?

41:11.203 --> 41:14.103
Nothing.
We just, um--

41:14.105 --> 41:16.172
I just want it
to be really special

41:16.174 --> 41:19.576
for you, ran-ran,
okay, hmm?

41:19.578 --> 41:22.579
So, I'm going
to be wanting you

41:22.581 --> 41:24.013
and your two girlfriends.

41:26.017 --> 41:27.617
What?

41:27.619 --> 41:31.187
Okay, if not,
no party.

41:31.189 --> 41:33.523
I'll tell clarelle.

41:33.525 --> 41:36.493
Okay, fine.
That's fine.

41:36.495 --> 41:39.229
Mm, good.

41:39.231 --> 41:41.865
I'm going to need you
to text me two photographs

41:41.867 --> 41:43.500
of your friends,

41:43.502 --> 41:45.068
and we meet here tonight.

41:45.070 --> 41:46.703
Oh, yeah, one more thing.

41:46.705 --> 41:49.839
I'm going to need
a deposit.

41:49.841 --> 41:51.674
I don't have
any fucking money.

41:51.676 --> 41:54.010
Hmm.

41:54.012 --> 41:56.646
That's a down payment,
pussy cat.

41:56.648 --> 41:59.282
Okay, ew, get the fuck
off me and leave.

41:59.284 --> 42:01.117
Where did you get that?

42:01.119 --> 42:04.187
Hmm, my resources
are none of your concern.

42:04.189 --> 42:06.890
But I encourage you
to please keep listening.

42:06.892 --> 42:10.159
I'll fucking give you half.
Fuck you, all right?

42:10.161 --> 42:11.594
I have been
in this fuckin' town

42:11.596 --> 42:13.062
for four fucking years...

42:13.064 --> 42:15.865
-How do you even--
-...The most degrading shit...

42:15.867 --> 42:17.634
Who the fuck are you?

42:17.636 --> 42:20.303
-Seriously?
-Shh.

42:20.305 --> 42:23.039
Snow bunny, hmm?

42:23.041 --> 42:26.009
A couple of hundred
and we meet here tonight.

42:26.011 --> 42:29.078
-You motherfuck--
-please hand over a deposit.

42:29.080 --> 42:31.748
And it will be
100% refundable once we...

42:34.119 --> 42:37.554
Can't
fucking believe this.

42:37.556 --> 42:38.955
Stop.

42:43.795 --> 42:46.095
You're so creamy.

42:46.097 --> 42:49.599
I'm sure you're filled
with juicy goodness.

42:49.601 --> 42:53.269
Oh, if I licked you
from the outside in,

42:53.271 --> 42:55.071
I'm sure you would taste

42:55.073 --> 42:59.742
like j-e-l-l-o.

42:59.744 --> 43:01.844
Okay, gross.
Come on.

43:01.846 --> 43:03.880
Oh, yes.
I like it.

43:03.882 --> 43:06.950
I've been a naughty schoolboy.
Spank me.

43:08.253 --> 43:12.021
Oh, my god.
You are a fucking pervert.

43:12.023 --> 43:14.057
You are truly disgusting.

43:16.061 --> 43:19.128
Where do you think
you're going, bitch?

43:19.130 --> 43:21.064
Excuse me, aunt jemima.

43:21.066 --> 43:23.132
Aunt jemima.
That's cute.

43:23.134 --> 43:25.101
-You like that?
-Was this before or after

43:25.103 --> 43:26.369
she took off the rag?

43:26.371 --> 43:27.704
I don't know, bitch.
You got a weave.

43:27.706 --> 43:30.607
- Don't touch me.

43:30.609 --> 43:32.775
Well, now that I know
what you up to,

43:32.777 --> 43:34.611
that little cute
designer purse

43:34.613 --> 43:35.612
is mine.

43:35.614 --> 43:38.114
-Oh, this one?
-Yeah.

43:38.116 --> 43:41.217
-Fuck you, bitch.
-Who you callin' a bitch,
bitch?

43:41.219 --> 43:42.819
Phula.

43:42.821 --> 43:44.387
Yeah, you better have my back,
motherfucker.

43:44.389 --> 43:45.888
Now, listen to me, bitch.

43:45.890 --> 43:47.256
Hold that bitch.

43:47.258 --> 43:49.025
This little
fucking designer purse,

43:49.027 --> 43:51.394
like I said, and everything
in it is mine, all right?

43:51.396 --> 43:53.162
And if you want
your little fiesta

43:53.164 --> 43:54.664
to go off
without a hitch,

43:54.666 --> 43:57.166
these are
my motherfuckin' terms.

43:57.168 --> 43:59.402
Now tap out, bitch,
and let me know you good.

44:01.005 --> 44:02.238
Squeeze her.

44:02.240 --> 44:03.773
Tap out, bitch!

44:03.775 --> 44:05.642
Fuck you.

44:05.644 --> 44:07.710
Hey, let her go.
She's dying.

44:07.712 --> 44:10.113
Oh, no, I been choked
by a lot of niggas
with big dicks.

44:10.115 --> 44:12.215
Trust me, I know
what a bitch can take.

44:12.217 --> 44:14.350
Tap out, bitch.

44:15.987 --> 44:17.987
Give me the fucking purse.

44:17.989 --> 44:19.288
-Oh.
-You good?

44:19.290 --> 44:20.723
See you later.

45:41.238 --> 45:43.940
Ah, do you know
there are 612 seconds

45:43.942 --> 45:45.208
in exactly 10.2 minutes

45:45.210 --> 45:49.011
and I have been out here
for 645, 646.

45:49.013 --> 45:51.948
Do you have any idea
what that kind of heat
does to the immune system?

45:51.950 --> 45:54.183
My mom just died.

45:54.185 --> 45:56.252
Oh, fuck.

45:56.254 --> 45:58.421
Yeah, she was
my best friend.

45:58.423 --> 46:02.158
Look, I'm sorry
if I came on too strong, okay?

46:02.160 --> 46:03.826
I can totally relate.

46:03.828 --> 46:06.295
My mom passed away
right after I finished school.

46:06.297 --> 46:08.998
Right after the funeral,
i had to get the hell out
of New York.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.399
I feel completely lost,
i mean, fuck, Carrie,

46:10.401 --> 46:11.868
I don't even have
a fucking agent.

46:11.870 --> 46:13.002
Well, maybe today's
your lucky day.

46:13.004 --> 46:14.337
I really need
to get myself

46:14.339 --> 46:16.038
out of this headspace
that I'm in,

46:16.040 --> 46:17.473
so I thought I'd throw
a party here tonight.

46:17.475 --> 46:19.142
And, you know,
there's gonna be some really

46:19.144 --> 46:20.810
-important people there.
-And I'm sure clarelle

46:20.812 --> 46:22.912
is just happy about that.

46:22.914 --> 46:24.347
Yeah, she's gonna go out
for the night.

46:24.349 --> 46:26.349
Look, clarelle and i
are really tight, okay?

46:26.351 --> 46:27.817
Tighter than you two are,

46:27.819 --> 46:29.786
so, you know,
she totally trusts me.

46:29.788 --> 46:31.921
If you don't go
and be a whiny little bitch

46:31.923 --> 46:33.956
and cry to clarelle
about the party,

46:33.958 --> 46:35.892
maybe I'll introduce you
to Vinnie tonight.

46:35.894 --> 46:37.426
-He's an agent.
-Don't touch me.

46:37.428 --> 46:38.895
'Cause god only knows
what kind of mold

46:38.897 --> 46:40.329
and parasites
live between your legs

46:40.331 --> 46:42.131
-and all over your body.
-Just shut up, all right?

46:42.133 --> 46:44.333
This is gonna open up
some really big doors
for you.

46:44.335 --> 46:46.435
Look, Vinnie is a huge agent,
all right?

46:46.437 --> 46:48.137
And, besides,
Hollywood is always looking

46:48.139 --> 46:50.106
for their next up-and-coming
colored talent.

46:50.108 --> 46:52.942
"Colored," really?
That's so bigot of you.

46:52.944 --> 46:54.243
-Fuck off.
-Oh, come on.

46:54.245 --> 46:56.179
This is gonna be
a big deal for you.

46:56.181 --> 46:58.815
Yeah? And why the fuck
should I believe you?

46:58.817 --> 47:01.117
-Why would I lie to you?
-Because you're
a fucking manipulating,

47:01.119 --> 47:02.351
conniving little bitch.

47:02.353 --> 47:04.153
What are you
so afraid of, hmm?

47:04.155 --> 47:05.421
Making a deal with the devil,
that's who.

47:05.423 --> 47:07.156
Pinky swear?

47:07.158 --> 47:08.591
I wouldn't trust
that pinkie if it was mine.

47:08.593 --> 47:10.459
Fool me once,
but it won't happen again.

47:10.461 --> 47:11.828
And the only way
i get out of this house

47:11.830 --> 47:13.262
is by booking jobs.

47:13.264 --> 47:15.031
So, if your buddy shows up
and everything goes

47:15.033 --> 47:17.099
exactly the way
you tell me it will,

47:17.101 --> 47:18.968
I will owe you for life.

47:18.970 --> 47:21.938
But if anything
goes south,

47:21.940 --> 47:23.472
don't ever look
in my fucking direction

47:23.474 --> 47:24.907
ever again.

47:25.943 --> 47:26.909
Deal.

47:27.945 --> 47:29.145
Now leave.

47:32.549 --> 47:34.383
-Bye.
-Cunt.

47:34.385 --> 47:36.419
Thank you.

48:07.252 --> 48:08.384
Oh.

48:09.920 --> 48:12.054
Oh, oh, yes.

48:16.193 --> 48:17.260
Oh.

48:20.265 --> 48:21.998
Oh.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.033
Oh, thank you.

48:39.149 --> 48:40.416
Hey.

48:40.418 --> 48:43.252
Hey, I gotta pee.

48:43.254 --> 48:46.289
I just want to talk to you
in private, okay?

48:46.291 --> 48:47.423
Now, tell me.

48:47.425 --> 48:49.125
What the fuck
were you doing

48:49.127 --> 48:51.193
making business deals
with that bitch Carrie, huh?

48:51.195 --> 48:53.129
You trying to make
mommy jealous?

48:54.631 --> 48:56.365
-Here, take a shot.
-No, I prefer not to.

48:56.367 --> 48:58.034
Shut up.
Just take it. Open up.

49:00.104 --> 49:02.371
Burns, right?

49:02.373 --> 49:04.707
Feels good, right?
Hmm?

49:04.709 --> 49:06.509
-Listen.
-What?

49:06.511 --> 49:08.511
Listen.

49:08.513 --> 49:11.480
I-- I want to know
why you cry.

49:11.482 --> 49:12.615
Oh, that's not important
right now.

49:12.617 --> 49:14.350
No, no, no.

49:14.352 --> 49:16.218
Because people don't cry
when they...

49:16.220 --> 49:20.022
Oh, I get it.

49:20.024 --> 49:21.724
You want to get personal.

49:21.726 --> 49:23.392
I'll show you
fucking personal.

49:26.330 --> 49:29.065
How's this
for personal, huh?

49:29.067 --> 49:31.133
-That personal enough?
-People will see.

49:31.135 --> 49:32.401
I don't give a fuck
who sees.

49:32.403 --> 49:33.602
Look at me.
Look at me, ranjit.

49:33.604 --> 49:35.104
-Look at me.
-Okay, okay.

49:35.106 --> 49:36.439
Look at me, okay?
Focus.

49:36.441 --> 49:38.140
Okay.

49:38.142 --> 49:40.176
--Yeah, right?

49:40.178 --> 49:43.446
Oh, you want this thick
caramel pussy, huh?

49:43.448 --> 49:44.981
-Yeah.
-Huh?

49:44.983 --> 49:46.315
-I--
-you what?

49:46.317 --> 49:47.583
-I want it.
-You do?

49:47.585 --> 49:49.118
I want the caramel
and the thickness

49:49.120 --> 49:51.287
-in the pussy.
-Oh, yeah.

49:51.289 --> 49:54.323
-I want it.
-You're gonna give me
this curry stick, huh?

49:54.325 --> 49:56.325
Hmm?

49:56.327 --> 49:59.662
Ooh, you're getting hard.
I like that.

49:59.664 --> 50:01.497
I'm going to give it
to you.

50:01.499 --> 50:03.466
You're gonna give it to me?
Tell me how. Tell me how.

50:03.468 --> 50:05.534
Give it to you like
I'm gonna put it inside you.

50:05.536 --> 50:07.169
Then what you gonna do?
Tell me.

50:07.171 --> 50:09.205
You gonna fuck me
the way the niggas do, huh?

50:09.207 --> 50:10.506
-Yeah.
-Hmm?

50:10.508 --> 50:13.075
-I'm gonna--
-what? Tell me, tell me.

50:13.077 --> 50:15.411
-I'm going to, like--
-like a what?

50:15.413 --> 50:17.079
-Like--
-like a what?

50:17.081 --> 50:19.215
-Like a big...
-Big what?

50:19.217 --> 50:22.018
-...black...
-Black what?

50:22.020 --> 50:23.352
-Donkey.
-Ooh, a donkey.

50:23.354 --> 50:25.621
Mm, I want to see
that fucking donkey.

50:28.358 --> 50:30.526
Yes!

50:32.764 --> 50:36.298
Okay.
Ah, okay, nice.

50:36.300 --> 50:38.601
Ooh, frisky.

50:38.603 --> 50:40.469
Let's go on the bed.

50:40.471 --> 50:42.038
-The bed.
-Okay, okay.

50:42.040 --> 50:43.572
The bed. Okay.
No, the bed.

50:44.809 --> 50:49.278
Enter now,
my world of mysticism.

50:49.280 --> 50:51.714
Do you want your pussy

50:51.716 --> 50:53.783
to be scratched
like a tiger?

50:53.785 --> 50:55.384
Shh.

50:55.386 --> 50:58.220
Oh.
Oh, my dreams.

50:58.222 --> 51:02.491
Ass to be ripped
by a big black cock?

51:02.493 --> 51:04.760
Bite it.
Bite it, my phula.

51:04.762 --> 51:07.229
Have you ever fucked
your mother?

51:07.231 --> 51:11.300
--Yeah, nigga, that's what
I'm talking about.

51:11.302 --> 51:13.269
Have you ever
fucked her in the ass

51:13.271 --> 51:16.405
and make her eat her own shit
by blowing your fucking cock?

51:16.407 --> 51:18.707
--Whoo.

51:18.709 --> 51:20.643
Okay, that's new.

51:20.645 --> 51:23.579
Whoo, frisky.

51:23.581 --> 51:25.281
Just put it in,
motherfucker.

51:25.283 --> 51:27.683
Do you want
to suck my cock?

51:27.685 --> 51:30.119
-Yes.
-Okay, okay.

51:30.121 --> 51:32.521
We're gonna put it in.
No, no.

51:32.523 --> 51:34.290
Motherfucker,
put it in.

51:34.292 --> 51:35.558
Okay, I'm gonna go.

51:35.560 --> 51:38.094
-Yes!
-Yes! Yes!

51:38.096 --> 51:39.562
-Yes!
-Yes!

51:39.564 --> 51:41.697
Oh, here we go.
Here we go.

51:41.699 --> 51:43.799
-What?
-I'm ready to shoot!

51:54.711 --> 51:57.246
I know you ain't just pumped
three times

51:57.248 --> 51:58.714
and skeet, motherfucker.

51:58.716 --> 52:01.517
Paradise, my love.

52:01.519 --> 52:03.152
You gonna finally
get me up here

52:03.154 --> 52:04.653
and you gonna pump twice
and skeet inside of me

52:04.655 --> 52:06.655
-and not let me know?
-Three times, my love.

52:06.657 --> 52:08.190
I ain't your love,
motehrfucker.

52:08.192 --> 52:09.492
I even called you "nigga."

52:09.494 --> 52:12.761
You ain't no nigga.
Niggas can fuck.

52:12.763 --> 52:15.197
-But...
-There's a party downstairs,

52:15.199 --> 52:16.632
and you know what
I'm gonna do?

52:16.634 --> 52:18.701
I'm gonna go find me
a nigga that can fuck.

52:18.703 --> 52:20.636
Fuckin' faster
than a computer.

52:20.638 --> 52:22.905
I gotta go spend money
on a morning after pill.

52:22.907 --> 52:25.508
Forty fucking dollars
that you gonna pay for.

52:25.510 --> 52:27.910
-But I...
-But what, squirt gun?

52:29.679 --> 52:30.779
But I love you.

52:30.781 --> 52:33.749
Oh, hell, no.

52:33.751 --> 52:35.284
-Gator?
-Yes, sir.

52:35.286 --> 52:37.219
-Get me some fuckin' blow.
-Yes, sir.

52:37.221 --> 52:39.321
-Make sure you get
at least an 8 ball.
-Okay.

52:39.323 --> 52:41.924
And keep your fucking change
like you usually do.

52:41.926 --> 52:43.726
Don't so fucking--

52:43.728 --> 52:45.194
damn it, ranjit,

52:45.196 --> 52:48.164
why you gotta make me
feel this way?

52:48.166 --> 52:50.633
This is my life.
This is what I do.

52:50.635 --> 52:53.169
This is who I am,
but I didn't ask
for this shit.

52:54.271 --> 52:57.473
And I'm a fucking ho.

52:57.475 --> 53:00.543
I fuck for money.

53:02.212 --> 53:03.946
It's really fucking hard
for me

53:03.948 --> 53:06.916
to see what's real
and what's fake.

53:09.319 --> 53:11.320
You don't know me, ranjit.

53:11.322 --> 53:12.955
But I want to know.

53:12.957 --> 53:15.891
You want to know
that my mom was a meth head?

53:17.561 --> 53:20.362
And my dad used to have
his friends come over

53:20.364 --> 53:21.664
when my mom
was in the streets

53:21.666 --> 53:23.632
to have his friends
fuck me?

53:25.402 --> 53:27.836
And I was taken away
by child services, okay?

53:27.838 --> 53:30.506
And raised
in a fucking white family.

53:30.508 --> 53:31.607
Fucking white school

53:31.609 --> 53:35.311
where everybody
made fun of me.

53:35.313 --> 53:38.380
Called me a nigga,
a spook.

53:38.382 --> 53:42.918
And sometimes I wish
the voices in my head
would just stop

53:42.920 --> 53:47.256
and I feel
like a fucking fake.

53:47.258 --> 53:48.857
What else do you
want to know?

53:48.859 --> 53:50.593
My phula.

53:50.595 --> 53:54.597
No, no, no, don't.
Don't feel bad for me.

53:55.899 --> 53:57.499
This is my life.

53:57.501 --> 54:00.769
This is what I chose,
so this is what I do.

54:03.273 --> 54:04.673
And if
there's anything genuine

54:04.675 --> 54:05.975
about what
you're saying to me,

54:05.977 --> 54:09.812
then I have
to let you know.

54:09.814 --> 54:11.614
'Cause I'm not the one.

54:16.353 --> 54:17.586
No.

54:19.289 --> 54:21.757
I can't love you, ranjit.

54:21.759 --> 54:24.827
I'm too busy trying
to fucking love myself.

54:40.478 --> 54:42.778
Boom!
What's up now, slut?

54:42.780 --> 54:44.046
-Fucking bitch.
-Yeah, bitch.

54:44.048 --> 54:46.282
Who fucks you now,
you fucking whore?

54:46.284 --> 54:48.284
That's for taking
my fucking purse,
you dirty little cunt.

54:48.286 --> 54:50.853
--Yeah, fuck you,
you dirty house nigger.

55:02.732 --> 55:05.467
-Hello, no ring. Thank--
-gator!

55:05.469 --> 55:08.437
Oh, Tyrell.
Fucking rad party, bro.

55:08.439 --> 55:09.805
Yeah. Hey,
did anybody ever tell you

55:09.807 --> 55:11.006
you look like
Abraham Lincoln

55:11.008 --> 55:12.975
with some serious bdsm
going on?

55:12.977 --> 55:15.678
-That's really interesting.
-Dude, that is
the nicest thing

55:15.680 --> 55:17.012
anyone
has ever said to me.

55:17.014 --> 55:18.781
Thank you.
Have you seen Carrie?

55:18.783 --> 55:20.416
I need to find her
right now.

55:20.418 --> 55:21.650
-I did.
-Yes?

55:21.652 --> 55:23.018
I did.
I saw her in the main room.

55:23.020 --> 55:24.753
Great.
I will see you later.

55:24.755 --> 55:26.355
Wait a second.
Are you okay?

55:26.357 --> 55:28.457
You know, you are
really sweating profusely.

55:28.459 --> 55:29.825
You should consider
the hospital.

55:29.827 --> 55:31.994
Not a chance
you're getting me to leave

55:31.996 --> 55:33.962
this place right here,
right now.

55:33.964 --> 55:35.464
But what I do need

55:35.466 --> 55:37.866
is for you to loosen up
the cheeks, okay?

55:37.868 --> 55:39.902
So, let's get these guys hard,
we'll get this loose.

55:39.904 --> 55:41.503
Meet me over here.

55:41.505 --> 55:43.505
I'm gonna mix you up
a little cocktail

55:43.507 --> 55:46.442
out of my two favorite colors,
pink and blue.

55:46.444 --> 55:48.444
-We put 'em in a...
-I'm not doing that, gator.

55:48.446 --> 55:50.045
It's kind of against
my upbringing.

55:50.047 --> 55:51.513
...put it in our nose.

55:51.515 --> 55:54.083
And then we go blast off.
Pew, pew.

55:54.085 --> 55:55.451
Okay, gator, look,
you should really

55:55.453 --> 55:56.752
not consider mixing--

55:56.754 --> 55:58.120
it's probably
really bad for you.

55:58.122 --> 55:59.788
Maybe talk to the food
and drug administration.

55:59.790 --> 56:01.056
Okay, you know what?
Here we go.

56:01.058 --> 56:02.791
Let's reverse
just a little bit,

56:02.793 --> 56:04.093
right back to where
i told you

56:04.095 --> 56:05.561
never to tell me
how to live my life again.

56:05.563 --> 56:06.862
That includes my drug use.

56:06.864 --> 56:08.797
Number two,
mixing things

56:08.799 --> 56:09.932
is what brought you
into existence,

56:09.934 --> 56:11.033
so let's not hate on it.

56:11.035 --> 56:12.501
And, number three,

56:12.503 --> 56:14.403
a little bit of e,
a little bit of v,

56:14.405 --> 56:16.705
and you're gonna be solid,
dude.

56:16.707 --> 56:17.740
Solid like a rock.

56:19.977 --> 56:22.144
-Oh, my god.
-Wow.

56:22.146 --> 56:23.946
Oh, my god,
that was amazing.

56:23.948 --> 56:26.615
Brain boner, man.
Whoa.

56:26.617 --> 56:28.784
Hey, hey, hey.
You got any ass plugs?

56:28.786 --> 56:30.919
Okay, and from the coolest
to the weirdest.

56:30.921 --> 56:32.888
I'm gonna go ahead
and get right on outta here.

56:32.890 --> 56:34.423
You're weird.

56:34.425 --> 56:35.991
No, no offense!

56:35.993 --> 56:38.994
D batteries?
Greasy door?

56:38.996 --> 56:40.662
Zucchini?

56:40.664 --> 56:41.797
Fuck!

56:50.940 --> 56:55.644
Oh, yes.
That feels good.

56:55.646 --> 56:58.547
You should know better.

56:58.549 --> 57:02.618
- You belong over there.

57:20.837 --> 57:23.572
You don't even know
what love is.

57:23.574 --> 57:25.641
Couldn't even hold it!

57:25.643 --> 57:27.509
Like a child!

57:29.747 --> 57:34.149
Why did you go away?

57:40.957 --> 57:42.024
Don't fucking push me.

57:43.660 --> 57:45.727
Ah, fuck!
This year.

57:45.729 --> 57:47.763
This is my fucking year,
motherfucker.

57:47.765 --> 57:49.198
I swear to you.
Okay, seriously?

57:49.200 --> 57:51.700
I'm gonna be
on a fuckin' runway,

57:51.702 --> 57:54.503
and by the time--
by this time next year,

57:54.505 --> 57:57.773
I'm gonna be in fucking Milan,
motherfucker.

57:57.775 --> 57:59.875
-Shut the fuck up.
-Fuck you, okay?

57:59.877 --> 58:03.512
I didn't move
to this goddamn town
to fucking fail, all right?

58:03.514 --> 58:04.947
Shut up.

58:04.949 --> 58:06.782
Mm,
that's fucking good.

58:06.784 --> 58:08.884
Mm.

58:08.886 --> 58:11.186
My motherfucking passport
is gonna be stamped!

58:12.890 --> 58:14.523
And everybody
in this goddamn town

58:14.525 --> 58:15.924
is gonna know
who I fucking am,

58:15.926 --> 58:17.626
and if anybody has
a fucking problem with it,

58:17.628 --> 58:19.495
well, they can suck
my fucking dick.

58:19.497 --> 58:20.629
Why don't I put my dick
in your mouth,

58:20.631 --> 58:21.697
you fucking bitch? Huh?

58:21.699 --> 58:23.131
-Yeah, my dick.
-My dick, bitch.

58:23.133 --> 58:25.133
No, my dick, motherfuck.
Get the fuck off.

58:25.135 --> 58:28.136
- Fuck you.

58:28.138 --> 58:30.572
I got a lump.
Do you got anything to drink?

58:30.574 --> 58:32.074
Yeah, I got that good shit
for you, bitch.

58:32.076 --> 58:33.675
Give it to me.

58:33.677 --> 58:35.277
Give it to me.
Fuckin'-- you're gross.

58:35.279 --> 58:37.679
Seriously, fuck off.

58:37.681 --> 58:39.114
Drink that shit, bitch.

58:39.116 --> 58:41.683
What is that salty shit?

58:41.685 --> 58:43.886
-What the fuck?
-That's that Mr. moist, baby.

58:43.888 --> 58:46.154
-What?
-It's that g, bitch.

58:46.156 --> 58:48.657
That's fucking g?
What the fuck is wrong with--

58:48.659 --> 58:50.259
get the fuck off me, fuck.

58:50.261 --> 58:51.693
What's wrong with you?

58:51.695 --> 58:53.061
Why would you
fucking give that to me?

58:53.063 --> 58:56.131
Get the fuck away from me,
seriously.

58:56.133 --> 58:59.201
-Get away from me.
Get away from me.
-What's the matter, bitch?

58:59.203 --> 59:00.869
--No.

59:00.871 --> 59:03.272
Get the fuck off me.

59:03.274 --> 59:07.009
Ah, feel that.
Feel that shit.

59:07.011 --> 59:08.710
Yeah, feel that shit.

59:08.712 --> 59:10.045
Get the fuck off me.

59:36.239 --> 59:41.176
Jiminy cricket,
you are enormous.

59:41.178 --> 59:43.645
-Whew.
-Where do you think
you're going?

59:43.647 --> 59:45.881
Just directly behind you
to get back to my room.

59:45.883 --> 59:49.151
-You need a stamp.
-I live there,
my room's there.

59:49.153 --> 59:50.352
I take a poop
behind the tree

59:50.354 --> 59:51.753
over there
every single morning.

59:51.755 --> 59:53.221
How many rooms
are back there?

59:53.223 --> 59:55.824
Four, with a door

59:55.826 --> 59:58.193
that leads
to a secret garden.

59:58.195 --> 01:00:00.829
All right, but don't let me
find out you lied to me.

01:00:00.831 --> 01:00:02.297
-See this hand?
-Yeah.

01:00:02.299 --> 01:00:04.066
Thirty pounds of pressure.

01:00:04.068 --> 01:00:05.801
Together with this hand?

01:00:05.803 --> 01:00:08.704
Forty pounds of pressure
per square inch.

01:00:08.706 --> 01:00:10.639
Crush your head
like a grape.

01:00:10.641 --> 01:00:11.940
Now move it along.

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:14.209
Pumpkins.
Peacocks.

01:00:52.215 --> 01:00:55.117
You're gonna find
a nigger to fuck?

01:00:55.119 --> 01:00:57.686
Huh? You're gonna find
a nigger to fuck?

01:00:59.088 --> 01:01:01.189
Yeah.

01:01:01.191 --> 01:01:04.259
I'm gonna find somebody
to fuck, too.

01:01:04.261 --> 01:01:06.795
Wait, whoa, whoa.
You're Tyrell.

01:01:06.797 --> 01:01:08.430
-Yeah.
-How long you been here?
Fucking a!

01:01:08.432 --> 01:01:10.365
We're supposed to get together
and hang out tonight.

01:01:10.367 --> 01:01:12.034
I didn't think-- she actually
talked about that?

01:01:12.036 --> 01:01:13.368
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:14.369
-Julliard, right?
-Yes!

01:01:14.371 --> 01:01:15.437
Oh, fuckin' a!

01:01:15.439 --> 01:01:16.872
Dude, this calls

01:01:16.874 --> 01:01:18.874
for a fucking
celebratory experience.

01:01:18.876 --> 01:01:20.842
Let's do
a fucking elephant tusk.

01:01:20.844 --> 01:01:22.110
Whoo!

01:01:22.112 --> 01:01:24.079
Okay, I don't know
what that is,

01:01:24.081 --> 01:01:26.314
-but it sounds
like a lot of fun.
-Fuckin' a, man.

01:01:26.316 --> 01:01:28.283
I'm so happy you're here.
I got so much to tell you.

01:01:28.285 --> 01:01:30.252
I'm so fucking excited
to work with you, baby.

01:01:30.254 --> 01:01:33.155
-Wow.
-Talented actor,
good-looking fuckin' guy.

01:01:33.157 --> 01:01:35.190
We're gonna make so much
fuckin' money in this town.

01:01:35.192 --> 01:01:37.092
-Oh, oh, okay.
-I'm gonna make you
a fuckin' star.

01:01:37.094 --> 01:01:39.728
Yeah, that's--
that's not my cup of tea.

01:01:39.730 --> 01:01:41.329
Vinnie, Vinnie.
Whoa, that's a lot.

01:01:41.331 --> 01:01:43.131
-That's a lot.
That looks like Alaska.
-T, baby,

01:01:43.133 --> 01:01:44.700
how the fuck are we supposed
to work together

01:01:44.702 --> 01:01:46.334
if we don't do
the same shit?

01:01:46.336 --> 01:01:48.437
Here's your chance to be
a motherfuckin' star, man.

01:01:48.439 --> 01:01:51.073
We are at the top
of the agency chain.

01:01:51.075 --> 01:01:52.974
B.B.B.E.,

01:01:52.976 --> 01:01:55.177
-Yeah.

01:01:55.179 --> 01:01:56.311
-That's good.
-I tell you what, man.

01:01:56.313 --> 01:01:57.746
Next week, we'll get lunch

01:01:57.748 --> 01:01:59.414

01:01:59.416 --> 01:02:02.117
Here's my business card.
I'mma make you a fucking star.

01:02:02.119 --> 01:02:03.351

This is good.

01:02:03.353 --> 01:02:05.087
This is good.
This is supposed to be.

01:02:05.089 --> 01:02:06.955
Get in here.
Let's seal the deal.

01:02:06.957 --> 01:02:08.056
Let's sign
the fuckin' contract.

01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:09.725
Only live once, right?

01:02:09.727 --> 01:02:11.193
Go ahead, right into
one nostril, plug the other.

01:02:11.195 --> 01:02:12.961
Come on, fucker, man up.
Man up.

Burn your fuckin' insides.
Melt your fuckin' brain.

01:02:20.838 --> 01:02:23.939
Give me
a fuckin' hit of that.

01:02:23.941 --> 01:02:27.109
-It burns!
-Good, it's supposed to.

01:02:27.111 --> 01:02:30.846
Whoo!

01:02:30.848 --> 01:02:32.180
Fuckin' enjoy it.

01:02:32.182 --> 01:02:33.982
I feel like I have
concrete in my throat.

01:02:33.984 --> 01:02:35.484
Yeah, that's the trip,

01:02:35.486 --> 01:02:38.120

Fucking cocksucker!
You see what I do?

01:02:55.806 --> 01:02:57.539

01:02:57.541 --> 01:03:00.442
I give you a fucking shot,
this is how you fucking

01:03:00.444 --> 01:03:04.179
Go fuck yourself.
You're a fucking nobody.

01:03:04.181 --> 01:03:07.215
-Get the fuck outta my way.

It's okay.
It's supposed to be that way.

01:03:35.912 --> 01:03:37.345
Candy.

01:03:37.347 --> 01:03:39.514
Candy!
Yo! Yes.

01:03:39.516 --> 01:03:41.016
What the fuck do you want?

01:03:41.018 --> 01:03:43.852
You forever and ever.
And ever.

01:03:43.854 --> 01:03:46.421
Oh, god,

01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:18.613
You are so pretty.

01:05:18.615 --> 01:05:20.649
Oh, my god,

01:05:20.651 --> 01:05:22.350
-Please god, tell me.
-No.

01:05:22.352 --> 01:05:23.919
But you could
if you want to.

01:05:23.921 --> 01:05:25.287
Oh, my god,
that was so much

01:05:25.289 --> 01:05:27.589
a better answer
than just yes.

01:05:27.591 --> 01:05:30.325
Tell me what I need to do.
I will do anything, girls.

01:05:30.327 --> 01:05:31.660
Anything.

01:05:31.662 --> 01:05:34.496
Fresh out the tank.

01:05:39.002 --> 01:05:43.004

I'm just gonna say this

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:04.292
Tell me into the camera
that you never saw me.

01:06:04.294 --> 01:06:07.963
-We never saw you.
-Oh, very good. Okay.

01:06:07.965 --> 01:06:09.631
End record.
Listen, girls.

01:06:09.633 --> 01:06:12.033
Here's the deal.
We're off the record.

01:06:12.035 --> 01:06:14.035
-I'm coming right back here.
-Where are you going?

01:06:14.037 --> 01:06:17.105

01:06:17.107 --> 01:06:18.707
Listen, just

01:06:18.709 --> 01:06:20.208
Or I will find you.

01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:21.977
If you stay,

01:06:21.979 --> 01:06:25.580
you can take all of the Molly
in that entire case.

01:06:25.582 --> 01:06:26.681
Have a great time,
in fact, girls,

01:06:26.683 --> 01:06:28.249
please take all the Molly

01:06:28.251 --> 01:06:31.019
'cause we're gonna have
so much fun.

01:06:31.021 --> 01:06:33.154
You guys--
god, I hate you, Carrie.

01:06:33.156 --> 01:06:36.224
Whoo, Jesus Mary-Kate
and Ashley Olsen.

01:06:36.226 --> 01:06:37.659
Who the fuck are you?

01:06:37.661 --> 01:06:39.694
Y-you l-like

01:06:39.696 --> 01:06:42.497
-Well, i--

01:06:42.499 --> 01:06:44.766
Okay, you two are...

01:06:44.768 --> 01:06:47.369
Let me know when you're ready
to graduate.

01:06:47.371 --> 01:06:48.536
Mm, I'm good where I am.

01:07:06.055 --> 01:07:07.389
Oh, you want a shot?

01:07:10.426 --> 01:07:13.762
What is she doing?

01:07:13.764 --> 01:07:16.064
- I want what she's on.
- -I'll take two.

01:07:16.066 --> 01:07:18.633
Right? Right?

01:07:29.512 --> 01:07:31.212
Oh, shit.

01:07:33.282 --> 01:07:36.051
No, no, no, no, shh.

Okay.

01:07:46.329 --> 01:07:51.533
What the fuck did you do?

01:07:51.535 --> 01:07:52.734
Fuck, fuck.

01:08:05.314 --> 01:08:06.514
Oh.

01:08:06.516 --> 01:08:08.750
- Oh, my god.

01:08:12.756 --> 01:08:14.722
O-m-g.

01:08:23.732 --> 01:08:26.667
Carrie.
Whoa, what are you on?

01:08:26.670 --> 01:08:29.437
Okay, yeah, yeah,

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:30.604
Yeah, yeah, monkeys.

01:08:30.607 --> 01:08:33.508
So much cocaÃ­na.

01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:36.111
- Yeah, fuck her.
-You guys are doing--

01:08:36.113 --> 01:08:37.377

01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:38.712
Carrie?

01:08:38.715 --> 01:08:40.548
Yo, Carrie, wake up!

01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:41.883
What the fuck are you doing,
motherfucker?

01:08:41.885 --> 01:08:43.350
What the fuck
are you doing, man?

01:08:43.353 --> 01:08:45.120
Get off my fuckin' roommate,

01:08:45.122 --> 01:08:46.688
-Get the fuck outta here!
-Carrie, wake up!

01:08:46.689 --> 01:08:48.423
-Get the fuck out!
-Carrie, wake up!

01:08:48.425 --> 01:08:52.193
Get off my roommate.
Get-- get of me, man.

01:08:52.194 --> 01:08:53.428
What the fuck are you guys
doing in here?

01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:54.761
No!

01:08:54.764 --> 01:08:56.131
Carrie!

01:08:56.133 --> 01:08:57.665
Carrie, wake up!

01:08:57.667 --> 01:08:59.734
Fucker, you scumbags!

01:08:59.736 --> 01:09:02.237
I got you on tape,
motherfuckers!

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:03.638
Come out here
and fight me like a man,

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:06.407
you fuckin' coward!

01:09:06.408 --> 01:09:08.309
You wanna fight, huh?

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:09.877
-You wanna fight?
-Yeah.

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:12.580
--Damn straight!

01:09:12.582 --> 01:09:16.184
Oh, god.
Come on, let's go.

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:18.520
Ah, damn it.

01:09:20.256 --> 01:09:22.157
Clarelle?

01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:24.526
-What the fuck?
-Clarelle?

01:09:24.528 --> 01:09:28.696
-What's wrong? Are you--
-oh, please, I'll sign
an autograph later.

01:09:28.698 --> 01:09:32.167
What are you talking about?
And what is with the nail
and the dirt?

01:09:32.169 --> 01:09:35.870
I'm sure we'll see
each other later.
Bye-bye, darling.

01:09:35.872 --> 01:09:38.372
-Clarelle.
-Bye-bye.

01:09:43.379 --> 01:09:44.879
What the fuck?

01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:54.455
Stay down, bitch!

01:09:56.392 --> 01:09:58.927
You're so beautiful.

01:09:58.929 --> 01:10:01.663
Big fan.
Big, big fan.

01:10:01.665 --> 01:10:03.965
Just gorgeous.
Just gorgeous, darling.

01:10:03.967 --> 01:10:06.634
Such a star.

01:10:06.636 --> 01:10:09.237
Thank you.

01:10:09.239 --> 01:10:11.873
Thank you.

01:10:14.578 --> 01:10:16.344
Oh.

01:10:25.321 --> 01:10:28.489
- Clarelle.
-You inspire me.

01:10:28.491 --> 01:10:32.360
Clarelle, we love you.

01:10:32.362 --> 01:10:35.263
We love you, clarelle.

01:10:35.265 --> 01:10:37.732
I'm gonna fucking find
somebody to fuck.

01:10:41.403 --> 01:10:43.304
Yeah.

01:10:48.344 --> 01:10:50.745
Clarelle, what are you?
What are you doing?

01:10:50.747 --> 01:10:52.347
Oh, yes, darling.

01:10:52.349 --> 01:10:53.748
Why are you carrying
those sticks?

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:56.017
Would you like a photo?

01:10:56.019 --> 01:10:58.853
Clarelle,
give me that pan.

01:10:58.855 --> 01:11:02.323
Get off of me
and don't touch my things!

01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:05.426
Have you no manners, sir?

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.894
I knew you had it in you.

01:11:42.331 --> 01:11:47.635
It was just a matter of time
before the world would see.

01:11:50.606 --> 01:11:53.074
I told you I could do it.

01:11:53.076 --> 01:11:57.912
Father
would have been proud.

01:12:01.483 --> 01:12:03.685
I knew you could do it,
dollface.

01:12:06.488 --> 01:12:08.022
Paul.

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:13.861
Why now,
all of a sudden?

01:12:17.533 --> 01:12:23.037
For years, you wanted me
to do what you wanted.

01:12:29.678 --> 01:12:30.645
Now...

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:32.847
I'm capable.

01:12:37.519 --> 01:12:39.053
You finally
got over yourself.

01:12:39.055 --> 01:12:42.523
You got out
of your own way.

01:12:42.525 --> 01:12:47.428
Eh, you get what you get
when you get it, right?

01:12:49.965 --> 01:12:51.432
I wouldn't have loved you
all these years

01:12:51.434 --> 01:12:54.001
if I didn't believe
in you.

01:12:54.003 --> 01:12:56.471
You're still as foxy
as the day we met.

01:12:56.473 --> 01:12:58.973
-Oh, don't talk that way.
-I've missed you.

01:13:03.512 --> 01:13:06.013
Oh, I've missed you, too.

01:13:11.086 --> 01:13:13.688
I never stopped.

01:13:17.393 --> 01:13:19.093
Come away with me.

01:13:19.095 --> 01:13:22.497
Just you and me,
the way it used to be.

01:13:22.499 --> 01:13:24.899
Leave
all this madness behind.

01:13:26.969 --> 01:13:29.871
--Clarelle?

01:13:29.873 --> 01:13:32.874
Oh, I guess
I'd better get back.

01:13:32.876 --> 01:13:36.744
The stage manager
is waiting for me.

01:13:36.746 --> 01:13:38.112
Paul, let go of me.

01:13:38.114 --> 01:13:39.447
--Clarelle?

01:13:39.449 --> 01:13:43.518
-I said let go.
-Shh.

01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:53.281
Drink, Carrie,
drink, drink.

01:15:53.283 --> 01:15:55.116
- Good, good, good, go, go, go.

01:15:55.118 --> 01:15:56.984
Okay, good girl,
good girl, good girl.

01:16:04.793 --> 01:16:09.330
Oh, we've got such
a great future together.

01:16:09.332 --> 01:16:14.702
Oh, look at ya.
Just like old times.

01:16:14.704 --> 01:16:17.204
Just you and I, kiddo.

01:16:21.109 --> 01:16:23.744
You okay?

01:16:23.746 --> 01:16:26.781
Jesus, you stupid
fucking beautiful bitch.

01:16:30.219 --> 01:16:33.321
Clarelle, open the door.

01:16:34.958 --> 01:16:36.791
Don't make me
kick the door in.

01:16:36.793 --> 01:16:39.226
- This party's over.

01:16:39.228 --> 01:16:41.696
--I'm ending it.

01:16:41.698 --> 01:16:43.064
-Tyrell?
-Gator?

01:16:43.066 --> 01:16:44.765
Oh, god.
Thank god.

01:16:44.767 --> 01:16:46.834
-Oh, fuck.
-Thank god, listen.
Look at me.

01:16:46.836 --> 01:16:49.103
Look at-- what the fuck
is wrong with you?

01:16:49.105 --> 01:16:51.272
Did you take everything
i gave you?

01:16:51.274 --> 01:16:53.341
God damn it, listen to me.
Go find clarelle, okay?

01:16:53.343 --> 01:16:56.611
-Where is she?
-I don't-- go fucking
check her room, go.

01:16:56.613 --> 01:16:59.213
- Sorry, sorry, move.
-Fucking Christ.

01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:06.687
You're doing so good.

01:17:06.689 --> 01:17:09.724
- Yeah, just let go.
- -Open the door, clarelle!

01:17:09.726 --> 01:17:11.058
--That's it.

01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:13.060
-Clarelle!
-That's it.

01:17:13.062 --> 01:17:14.295
Open the door!

01:17:16.633 --> 01:17:19.266
Clarelle?

01:17:19.268 --> 01:17:22.203
Clarelle! Oh, my god,
what have you done?

01:17:22.205 --> 01:17:24.071
Somebody help!

01:17:26.876 --> 01:17:28.876
Oh, my god, fuck.
Somebody call 9-1-1.

01:17:28.878 --> 01:17:30.244
Somebody call
a doctor now!

01:17:30.246 --> 01:17:32.880
-Clarelle, clarelle.
-Somebody call 9-1-1!

01:17:32.882 --> 01:17:34.649
Tyrell,
there's no time to explain.

01:17:34.651 --> 01:17:36.984
She's not breathing
and her pulse is fading.

01:17:36.986 --> 01:17:39.720
Listen, I need you
to apply pressure here.

01:17:39.722 --> 01:17:41.288
There's too much blood.
There's too much blood.

01:17:41.290 --> 01:17:43.858
-There's too much--
-fucking apply the pressure!

01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:45.760
Don't worry
about your germ shit!

01:17:45.762 --> 01:17:50.097
Somebody call 9-1-1!

01:17:50.099 --> 01:17:52.400
I can't hear anything.

01:17:52.402 --> 01:17:54.301
I don't know
if she's breathing.

01:17:54.303 --> 01:17:58.172
Listen to me. Listen to me!
Listen to me, okay?

01:17:58.174 --> 01:18:00.307
We have to get her
to a hospital, okay?

01:18:00.309 --> 01:18:02.076
We have to put her
in this sheet.

01:18:02.078 --> 01:18:04.245
You get her legs,
I'll get her shoulders.

01:18:04.247 --> 01:18:05.413
-Okay. All right.
-Okay, on three.

01:18:05.415 --> 01:18:08.315
One, two, three!

01:18:12.888 --> 01:18:14.922
Let's get her out of here.

01:18:16.391 --> 01:18:18.292
Party's over, motherfuckers.

01:18:18.294 --> 01:18:19.827
Get the fuck out of here.

01:18:19.829 --> 01:18:21.929
I'm shutting
this motherfucker down.

01:18:21.931 --> 01:18:24.699
Party is over!

01:18:24.701 --> 01:18:26.867
Oh, god!

01:18:26.869 --> 01:18:29.437
I can't hold her!

01:18:29.439 --> 01:18:31.338
Come on,
i knew you could do it.

01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:33.274
You're almost there.
Aw, I can't wait to get you.

01:18:40.115 --> 01:18:43.117
Tell me what is going on!

01:18:43.119 --> 01:18:44.985
What is happening?

01:18:44.987 --> 01:18:47.154
Tell me what is going on!

01:18:47.156 --> 01:18:49.457
- Fuck!

01:18:54.497 --> 01:18:56.997
- She's dead!
She's dead!
-Oh, my god.

01:18:56.999 --> 01:18:58.999
Oh, god.

01:18:59.001 --> 01:19:01.168
Come on, we gotta get out!
Go, go, go.

01:19:01.170 --> 01:19:02.903
She's dead.

01:19:02.905 --> 01:19:04.405
She's dead.

01:19:06.142 --> 01:19:08.943
Please don't go away.

01:19:08.945 --> 01:19:10.511
Oh, god.

01:19:14.216 --> 01:19:18.185
Please, somebody help her.

01:19:23.258 --> 01:19:24.458
Please.

01:19:27.963 --> 01:19:30.464
Please come back.

01:19:30.466 --> 01:19:32.366
Please.

01:19:32.368 --> 01:19:34.969
Clarelle, don't go.
