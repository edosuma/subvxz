get you to a doctor?

That didn't
come up last night?

You never told me
what caused your accident.

01:01.229 --> 01:03.345
I was stabbed by a patient.

Sort of. At least
as good as the other

12 times that I've
called and paged you

ljust didn't feel like

talking to you.
Kinda like now.

You don't have
to work for House,

03:39.470 --> 03:41.301
but you do owe me
20 clinic hours.

03:41.972 --> 03:44.304
What? Getting knifed
doesn't buy me an extension?

03:44.433 --> 03:48.142

No, none at all.

04:27.685 --> 04:29.346

but no hard physical work,

04:33.023 --> 04:34.729
or repetitive motion.

04:34.859 --> 04:36.565
Couple of possibilities.

04:36.694 --> 04:38.104
You have enlarged
lymph nodes, so

04:38.195 --> 04:39.981
I'd like to start by
ruling out breast cancer.

04:40.573 --> 04:43.815
And I do mean rule out.
It's probably nothing.

04:44.827 --> 04:46.442
I'm gonna do
a quick breast exam.

04:46.537 --> 04:48.448
Do you mind

Not at all.

04:52.710 --> 04:55.668
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

04:56.380 --> 04:58.371
That was so I could ask
about the second possibility.

04:59.091 --> 05:03.255
Left-sided pain
means it could be angina,
which is made worse by stress.

05:03.387 --> 05:05.218
Might not be
a coincidence
that the pain

05:05.306 --> 05:07.718
started on the verge
of a major life change.

05:08.601 --> 05:09.590
How did you know?

05:09.894 --> 05:11.259
Blue veil means
you're a postulant,

05:13.689 --> 05:15.725
Brown vestments
means you're Carmelites,

05:15.858 --> 05:18.520
cloistered nuns,
which explains the chaperone.

05:21.572 --> 05:23.528
You're about to withdraw
from the world for good.

05:25.201 --> 05:26.907

05:27.077 --> 05:28.783

didn't take his vows.

my ass look fat.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.335
Do you mind
unbuttoning your shirt
and lying down for me?

05:35.419 --> 05:36.750
Okay.

05:37.379 --> 05:42.590
l have had second thoughts.
I'm kind of a wreck.

05:45.596 --> 05:48.588
A life of perpetual enclosure
and almost complete silence?

05:49.099 --> 05:50.259
If you weren't
wrestling with this,

05:50.351 --> 05:53.218
I'd say there's something
really wrong with you.

05:58.150 --> 06:00.061
I'm going to admit you.

06:00.152 --> 06:02.268
There's a little mass here,
and I'd like to
get it checked out.

06:04.949 --> 06:07.816
It's just
a benign fat deposit,
her imaging's clean.

06:07.952 --> 06:12.161
Stress test, too.
It's not angina.
So why the shoulder pain?

06:12.289 --> 06:16.453
Is it possible that
she hurt her shoulder?

06:16.961 --> 06:17.950
Thanks a lot.

06:18.087 --> 06:19.042
I didn't tell him.

06:19.129 --> 06:21.120
You were cagey about
where you were going,

06:21.298 --> 06:23.254
and Chase has been
cagey in general.

06:23.342 --> 06:25.503
Good chance I'd
find the two of you
in the same cage,

06:25.928 --> 06:27.418
so I had Park follow you.

06:29.473 --> 06:30.758

long-abandoned faith

She was next up in the clinic.
And I don't want your help.

06:44.488 --> 06:47.605
You got stabbed,
you blame me.

06:48.826 --> 06:50.566
But what did
you learn about me

06:50.661 --> 06:52.151
that you hadn't
known for years?

06:52.371 --> 06:54.362
Maybe I was an idiot before,
and I'm not one now.

06:54.498 --> 06:56.204
Or maybe
the reverse is true.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.293
Thanks for all your help.

07:05.134 --> 07:08.251
Your soul sister is
having a fungal infection

07:08.345 --> 07:11.428
from the unprocessed wheat
in the altar breads.

07:11.515 --> 07:14.973

and the jumbo lymph nodes.

some companionship.

everywhere you look.

07:57.561 --> 08:00.519

might need someone
to talk to about it.

08:01.231 --> 08:04.769
Just knowing you're
there for me is enough.

08:15.037 --> 08:16.868

08:18.290 --> 08:22.283
l've surfed all
over the Gold Coast.
Don't tell me you have.

08:22.419 --> 08:26.378
The closest I
got was Waimea Bay.
I grew up on Maui.

08:29.593 --> 08:32.881
If you don't mind me asking,
why are you becoming a nun?

08:33.764 --> 08:35.550
You're asking because I surf?

08:36.058 --> 08:38.674
Well, I know that Jesus
walked on water, but...
(LAUGHS)

08:39.228 --> 08:41.810
Plus the average postulant's
a lot younger than you.

08:42.940 --> 08:44.851
What were
you doing before this?

08:44.942 --> 08:47.433
Not much of anything.
Worked as a nanny,

08:47.569 --> 08:49.981
moved around a lot,
bunch of failed relationships.

08:50.447 --> 08:54.986
And then what?
God spoke to you?
You heard the calling?

08:56.495 --> 08:58.326
Something like that.

09:00.624 --> 09:03.411
Does there have to be
some dramatic moment
where the skies part?

09:04.086 --> 09:05.667
Usually, yeah.

09:05.796 --> 09:08.788
Is that what happened
to you when you
entered the seminary?

09:11.135 --> 09:15.845
Mom drank, Dad worked,
they stuck me in
Catholic school.

09:15.973 --> 09:19.090
Priests and nuns
were the closest
I had to family.

09:19.184 --> 09:21.561
Turned out that wasn't
much of a reason
to join the priesthood.

09:21.645 --> 09:23.306
Is that why you left?

09:25.357 --> 09:26.767
Something like that.

09:34.158 --> 09:36.194
I think I may throw up.

09:47.171 --> 09:49.378
What's wrong with me?

09:50.174 --> 09:52.790
Not a fungal infection.

10:00.642 --> 10:03.475
You're probably wondering,
why the soda balloons.

10:03.562 --> 10:04.927
I'm not.

10:05.022 --> 10:07.729
Well, I'll tell you.
You're not the only one

10:07.816 --> 10:09.477

spiraled out of control

10:09.568 --> 10:11.024
when you got
knifed in the ventricle.

10:11.153 --> 10:12.359
Taub has decided...

10:12.488 --> 10:13.648
I need help with my patient.

10:13.739 --> 10:16.446
She's vomiting.
That's not from
a fungal infection.

10:16.533 --> 10:17.648
So what are you
planning to do now

10:17.785 --> 10:18.865
that you're not
working for me?

10:18.994 --> 10:20.530
l have no idea.

10:21.371 --> 10:24.078
Almost dying's
been clarifying.
I can do anything.

10:24.166 --> 10:27.124
You can do anything,
so you come back to

10:27.211 --> 10:29.452
the same building you
worked in for years?

10:30.380 --> 10:32.120
Guess you can cross
that off your bucket list.

10:32.216 --> 10:34.047
Can we get to my
patient sometime soon?

10:34.176 --> 10:37.964
As soon as you admit that
you're a confused mess, sure.

10:38.055 --> 10:39.636
You'll help me.
Because even though

10:39.723 --> 10:40.963
you don't find my
case interesting,

10:41.058 --> 10:43.094
you find my interest
in it interesting.

10:45.270 --> 10:49.559
When you put it that way...
Ascending cholangitis.

10:54.112 --> 10:55.192
Missed me!

10:55.280 --> 10:57.612
It can't be,
bilirubin's normal.

10:58.450 --> 11:01.908

can show up days
before lab signs.

This is great, we should
make this a regular thing.

11:13.090 --> 11:14.705
She can't feel
her foot at all.

11:19.304 --> 11:20.805
What does this mean?

11:21.890 --> 11:25.599
Means I've gotta spend
more time consulting
with a colleague.

11:30.941 --> 11:34.650
His 17-ketosteroid
levels are low.
How can he be...

11:34.778 --> 11:37.440
He tried to
tongue-kiss Park
when you were closer.

11:37.823 --> 11:39.529
Think his sexuality's normal?

11:39.616 --> 11:43.234
I need more help.
My patient has a new symptom,
ischemic foot.

11:43.912 --> 11:47.120
Get the lecture
out of your system,
so we can talk about my case.

11:49.293 --> 11:52.285
Let me start
with an allegory...

11:54.089 --> 11:55.420
(EXCLAIMS |N SURPRISE)

11:59.469 --> 12:01.300
Okay, I'm curious...

12:02.347 --> 12:04.804
Your overreaction
to your stabbing is

12:04.975 --> 12:07.432
to blame me even as
you're drawn to me.

12:07.519 --> 12:11.057
Taub's is to take moronic
self-defense classes

12:11.148 --> 12:14.060
that won't defend
him against anything.

12:14.151 --> 12:16.813
Krav Maga.
Which helped me
block your shot,

12:16.945 --> 12:18.560
and will continue to
help me defend myself

12:18.697 --> 12:20.358
in a building full of
drugged-up strangers.

12:20.490 --> 12:23.857
Taub has to accept that
by instinct and genetics,

12:23.994 --> 12:25.780
he is a coward,
who's better off running

12:25.913 --> 12:27.744
and hiding at
the first sign of danger.

12:27.831 --> 12:30.493
I've already fended off
six of your
blitzkriegs in a row.

12:30.584 --> 12:33.747
And the seventh?
And the eighth?
And the nth?

12:33.837 --> 12:35.668
If you get him,
what's that gonna prove?

12:35.756 --> 12:37.496
That unexpected
things happen.

12:38.008 --> 12:40.715
By definition, no class
can teach you to expect them.

12:41.345 --> 12:43.336
Which is why Taub is
idiotic to study them,

12:43.430 --> 12:45.921
and you're idiotic
to attach any
significance to them.

12:46.558 --> 12:47.547
Blood clot.

12:48.185 --> 12:50.016

On the other hand...

12:59.029 --> 13:01.361
What if he's right
about the blockage,
but wrong about the cause?

13:02.032 --> 13:03.238
Vasospasm.

13:03.575 --> 13:05.486
Explain everything
but the lymph nodes...

Any minor infection could
have caused those.

Calcium channel
blocker to treat.

13:21.551 --> 13:23.507
Are you okay?

13:23.595 --> 13:26.257
I almost got you killed
by bringing a scalpel
into that room.

13:26.390 --> 13:29.052
I could feel
better about that.
You saved my life, too.

13:29.726 --> 13:31.557
I think the ledger's clear.

13:33.397 --> 13:35.308
But how can you
not be traumatized?

13:35.440 --> 13:37.396
Can't change what happened.

13:37.651 --> 13:40.438
I can only make
better choices from here.

13:40.570 --> 13:44.062
So you're Zen about it,
but won't let go of
your anger toward House.

13:47.411 --> 13:50.744
I'm seeing
a trauma counselor.
I think you should, too.

13:51.248 --> 13:55.116
I'm okay.
Just knowing you're
there for me is enough.

14:04.428 --> 14:06.214
The convent
lets you have this?

14:06.304 --> 14:08.636
I borrowed it from
one of the nurses.

14:09.266 --> 14:10.506
I'm still on temporary vows.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.977
It may be
the last time I hear
Eminem for a while.

14:14.271 --> 14:18.435
You're using an iPod,
but I've never seen
you use rosary beads.

14:23.447 --> 14:25.813
What day did Jesus die?

14:25.949 --> 14:30.238
I know,
one gospel says Passover,
another says the day before.

14:30.328 --> 14:33.866
How many times
did the cock crow
before Peter's third denial?

14:33.957 --> 14:35.663
Once or twice?

14:35.792 --> 14:37.498
You can't argue away my faith.

14:37.627 --> 14:41.586
Why? Because it's so strong
even plain contradictions...

14:41.673 --> 14:43.334
Because it's not that strong.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.967
I'm not saying
I don't have faith.

14:48.680 --> 14:51.012
| just haven't
felt the calling yet.

14:51.141 --> 14:54.349
No one joins the clergy
without having an epiphany.

14:54.478 --> 14:56.890
Like God's love is
speaking to you directly.

14:57.314 --> 15:02.308
It's the silence,
the contemplation, the order.

15:03.570 --> 15:04.685
I need them.

15:07.991 --> 15:09.856
I'm hoping everything
else will come later.

15:10.327 --> 15:15.242
That's not an answer.
If you want silence,
you can get earplugs.

15:15.332 --> 15:18.916
I tried the outside world.
It wasn't enough.

15:19.169 --> 15:21.501
Have you been married?
No.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.453
No kids?
You never found a career?

15:23.548 --> 15:26.085
Doesn't sound like
the outside world
got much of a try.

15:28.553 --> 15:31.010
What you're
headed towards now...

15:31.681 --> 15:33.888
Fourteen hours
a day in silent prayer,

15:34.684 --> 15:36.220
never having a family,

15:36.478 --> 15:38.469
never touching
another human being...

15:38.563 --> 15:41.054
Just because that's what
you'd miss the most...

15:43.193 --> 15:45.354
The nurses talk.

15:49.199 --> 15:50.530
Nothing's wrong
with having fun.

15:51.243 --> 15:54.280
They said you
were almost killed
three weeks ago.

15:54.371 --> 15:56.202
You go right back to fun?

15:57.290 --> 16:00.782
Is that why you
want to be a nun?
Someone broke your heart?

16:01.753 --> 16:03.414
No.

16:05.799 --> 16:08.916
I'm just looking
for something more.

16:11.555 --> 16:12.761
So am I.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.773
l'm late for
work in the clinic.

16:44.379 --> 16:46.916
Really? George Washingbaum?

16:47.799 --> 16:49.335
He was a character
in the F/intsteins.

16:50.677 --> 16:53.214
Just hiding out till
House leaves the cafeteria.

16:57.475 --> 16:58.885
Those self-defense classes,

16:59.769 --> 17:01.270
you think they're making
any kind of difference?

17:02.564 --> 17:04.520
Not as much as
House's surprise attacks.

17:04.649 --> 17:06.605
He thinks three steps ahead,
so I do, too.

17:08.486 --> 17:11.273
Which is why you
should accept his apology
and come back on the team.

17:11.948 --> 17:16.191
He's annoying, he's maddening,
but he makes us all better.

17:18.705 --> 17:20.070
Note to self.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.995
Foot color's good,
arterial pulse is good,

17:29.299 --> 17:30.630
capillary refill's good.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.298
And her shoulder
pain's all gone.

17:32.636 --> 17:35.298
Looks like you're
ready to go home.

17:35.972 --> 17:39.135
I'll get the car
and meet you out front.

17:42.479 --> 17:46.597
I'd say I'm in the book,
but not the one you'll
be reading from now on.

17:54.532 --> 17:58.525
Six years ago,
l was a nanny in Honolulu.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.327
For this beautiful
two-year-old boy.

18:02.374 --> 18:07.744
I loved him,
probably spent more time
with him than his own parents.

18:09.589 --> 18:13.502
One day, l was in the park,
talking with another nanny.

18:14.636 --> 18:17.673
He wandered out
of the sandbox,
into the street,

18:19.140 --> 18:21.005
into the path
of a moving car.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.018
That could've
happened to anyone.

18:26.189 --> 18:27.770
I don't think so.

18:29.067 --> 18:31.649
And even if it did,
they'd blame themselves

18:31.736 --> 18:33.567
for the rest of
their lives, too.

18:33.655 --> 18:35.236
You shouldn't.

18:37.951 --> 18:40.613
And you shouldn't run
from what can
still be a good life.

18:41.121 --> 18:43.157
I'm running to God.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.161
After what happened to you,
don't you want to
remake your life?

18:48.712 --> 18:50.498
Not by hiding myself away.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.248
I hope it works out for you.

18:59.222 --> 19:00.803
It is gonna be hard,

19:02.809 --> 19:04.925
not touching anyone.

19:50.023 --> 19:54.062
Who knew Mother lnferior
was a smokin' hottie?

19:54.152 --> 19:56.108
No wonder you're
playing handsies with her.

19:56.279 --> 19:58.235
You think I'm
hitting on a nun?

19:58.323 --> 20:00.655
Angry at God,
or | just need a challenge?

20:01.368 --> 20:03.108
Or you're
terrified of intimacy,

20:03.286 --> 20:05.026
which is why
you're a serial slut,

20:05.121 --> 20:08.784
but right now you're grasping
at an emotional life raft.

20:08.917 --> 20:12.375
Ideally, someone for whom
intimacy's not an option.

20:12.462 --> 20:13.998
That actually makes sense,
which I can't say

20:14.130 --> 20:15.666
about anything else
you've been doing.

20:15.757 --> 20:17.713
I'm not emotionally
involved with her.

20:17.801 --> 20:20.133
And much as I'd love
to hear you contradict me,

20:20.220 --> 20:21.926
l have a 7:30
appointment to explore

20:22.013 --> 20:24.004
my intimacy
issues at La Scala.

20:26.101 --> 20:28.638
I'm talking to this agent,
he's a bit of a sleaze,

20:28.728 --> 20:30.844
but he's really excited
about representing me.

20:30.939 --> 20:33.146
Although he can't take on
any new clients right now,

20:33.233 --> 20:35.975
he's trying to
get me an audition
for one of those online soaps.

20:36.069 --> 20:37.434
Have you ever
watched one of those?

20:41.157 --> 20:42.272
Am I boring you?

20:47.122 --> 20:50.614
Unfortunately, yeah. Sorry.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.260
Hi.

21:06.891 --> 21:10.679
You're not
supposed to be here.
Or anywhere.

21:15.275 --> 21:19.109
You were right,
I was running away.

22:02.155 --> 22:04.396
Oh, now you're shy.

22:07.076 --> 22:09.567
lt's brighter in the morning.

22:15.668 --> 22:19.502
So, are we gonna
spend the rest of
eternity in a lake of fire

22:19.589 --> 22:23.298
while pointy-tailed
demons poke at us
with sticks?

22:27.597 --> 22:29.337
This is
a little scary for me.

22:30.350 --> 22:34.719
I had a whole life planned,
not that I wasn't
struggling with it...

22:35.730 --> 22:36.936
And then I met you.

22:38.691 --> 22:41.478
Don't worry,
I know you're not
the relationship type.

22:42.028 --> 22:44.986
I'm not not
the relationship type.
I was married once.

22:45.240 --> 22:48.027
(LAUGHS) Relax.
You're fine.

22:51.079 --> 22:52.410
So what's next for you?

22:55.375 --> 22:57.912
l have to find
a place to live,

22:58.461 --> 23:00.417
get my old job back...

23:01.172 --> 23:04.255
I'm sure I'll feel guilty,
start doubting...

23:04.634 --> 23:06.090
Well, as long as
you keep dealing with

23:06.177 --> 23:07.883
your doubts in
the same way, then...

23:11.349 --> 23:12.338
Moira?

23:12.809 --> 23:14.720
I'm sorry,
did you say something?

23:17.772 --> 23:19.728
Your neck...
What?

23:20.567 --> 23:21.807
Are your ears ringing?

23:21.943 --> 23:23.149
Yeah.

23:24.487 --> 23:25.602
What does that mean?

23:26.322 --> 23:27.311
(VOMlTS)

23:28.408 --> 23:31.115
Let me get you
back to the hospital
right away.

23:31.202 --> 23:32.408
The artery
that's bringing blood

23:32.495 --> 23:33.951
to your brain,
it's coming apart.

23:34.372 --> 23:37.284
It means you could stroke.
l've paged a team
of our best doctors.

23:37.375 --> 23:39.331
I don't have
to cough as much.

23:40.670 --> 23:42.001
lt's clotted up.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.953
Is that bad?
We're almost there.

23:47.051 --> 23:48.302
CHASE: Get me her 02 level.

23:50.763 --> 23:51.843
What are you doing?

23:51.931 --> 23:53.762
I want to make
sure I can position
her wrist properly.

23:53.850 --> 23:55.431
For what?
ABG.

23:55.518 --> 23:57.349
I don't need an ABG,
just get a pulse ox.

23:58.438 --> 24:01.180
I'll do it,
grab a consent form. Go.

24:02.900 --> 24:04.356
We need to
operate right now, okay?

24:04.527 --> 24:05.983
Good. To operate.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.730
Can you repeat this?
"No ifs, ands
or buts about it."

24:10.825 --> 24:13.692
No about it, and no ifs...

24:14.078 --> 24:15.454
Get her into OR 11.

24:23.546 --> 24:25.832
Carotid dissection,
four-inch pulsatile mass

24:25.923 --> 24:27.709
in her neck,
and some Broca's aphasia.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.631
There's gotta be a clot
keeping her from bleeding out.

24:29.719 --> 24:30.708
Pulse?

24:30.803 --> 24:32.589
Bounding, four-plus.
It was a three-plus

24:32.680 --> 24:34.216
twenty minutes ago.

24:34.599 --> 24:35.964
Twenty?

24:36.059 --> 24:37.265
I thought she just got here.

24:40.730 --> 24:44.143
That blood looks pretty dry.
Cut yourself shaving?

24:45.610 --> 24:47.475
You know, that can
happen when the nun

24:47.612 --> 24:49.523
you woke up with
coughs blood on you.

24:50.198 --> 24:52.063
You slept with a nun?

24:52.241 --> 24:54.106
Forget nun,
you slept with a patient?

24:54.202 --> 24:55.817
Former. To both.

24:55.912 --> 24:58.119
HOUSE: lnternal neck trauma?
That's impressive.

24:58.289 --> 25:01.076
It's happened to me
a few times. Up high.

25:02.585 --> 25:03.665
Dr. Chase.

25:06.631 --> 25:09.498
The clot's broken.
Bring her in
and pack her nose.

25:09.592 --> 25:10.957
We're gonna need
number three Vicryls.

25:11.511 --> 25:12.967
We're gonna fix this.

25:13.054 --> 25:14.294
You're not going
to operate on her?

25:14.389 --> 25:16.004
Kapur and Carlyle
are unavailable,

25:16.099 --> 25:18.181
Reilly's done far
fewer dissections
than I have.

25:18.267 --> 25:20.303
He's also slept
with her far fewer
times than you have.

25:20.395 --> 25:21.555
Yourjudgment's
compromised.

25:21.896 --> 25:24.512
I spent the night with her,
doesn't change how
I make an incision.

25:24.607 --> 25:25.938
Tell him.

25:28.111 --> 25:29.476
Do the surgery.

25:30.780 --> 25:32.111
You're trying to
score points with him

25:32.240 --> 25:33.571
at the risk of
a patient's life.

25:34.659 --> 25:35.990
He's the better surgeon.

25:39.163 --> 25:41.540
Vascular clamp.
You're not going to
put her on bypass?

25:41.624 --> 25:42.864
lt'd take a half
hour to setup.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.251
You clamp now,
she could stroke out.

25:44.335 --> 25:46.667
She's already got
neurological symptoms.

25:46.754 --> 25:48.790
We wait 30 minutes,
she'll definitely
have brain damage.

25:48.881 --> 25:51.258
You're trying to
make sure she's
either perfect or dead.

25:51.342 --> 25:53.082
She's not going to die.
If I get this done

25:53.219 --> 25:54.959
in five minutes,
she won't stroke out.

25:55.054 --> 25:56.294
You don't know
that you will.

25:56.389 --> 25:59.222
And you can't know
because you can't think
clearly about her.

26:00.393 --> 26:01.473
Vascular clamp.

26:09.610 --> 26:13.694
Occlusion time,
9:46, 23 seconds.

26:13.781 --> 26:15.521
Vascular scissors.

26:49.901 --> 26:51.437
We're over five minutes.

26:54.614 --> 26:56.195
Ultrasound.

27:02.914 --> 27:04.779
Good flow.
Lighten the anesthesia.

27:05.625 --> 27:06.785
You're not going to
close the wound first?

27:06.876 --> 27:07.865
No.

27:16.052 --> 27:17.542
(COUGHING)

27:23.643 --> 27:25.304
Can you hear me?

27:28.189 --> 27:32.148
Repeat this.
"No ifs, ands or buts."

27:33.528 --> 27:36.361
"No ifs, ands or buts."

27:42.912 --> 27:45.654
I'm sorry about before.

27:47.416 --> 27:49.668
You're scared, aren't you?

27:49.752 --> 27:51.333
That's why you
wanted companionship.

27:51.420 --> 27:53.627
It's why you cried out
when House shot at Taub.

27:54.423 --> 27:55.754
What exactly
are you scared of?

27:56.467 --> 27:59.425
A needle stick?
Some other nut
pulling a scalpel?

28:00.805 --> 28:03.046
I'm scared of everything.

28:03.140 --> 28:06.803
It sucks that
there was a stabbing,
but you'll get over it.

28:07.270 --> 28:08.350
Like you have?

28:09.313 --> 28:12.180
You weren't even there.
I know. I...

28:12.275 --> 28:15.108
I left the room,
it was pure luck...

28:15.278 --> 28:18.111
l was in the room.
That was pure luck, too.

28:21.617 --> 28:25.326
| get that you're
scared and guilty.
You're still a doctor.

28:25.454 --> 28:27.661
I don't have time to
teach you to act like one.

28:33.296 --> 28:35.378
We removed the artery,
found nodules.

28:35.923 --> 28:37.208
Could mean lupus.

28:37.300 --> 28:40.337
Negative ANA.
Where are you going?

28:41.012 --> 28:43.970
Great thing
about assigning Taub
fraudulent lab work

28:44.056 --> 28:46.923
is you know exactly
where he's gonna end up.

28:47.018 --> 28:50.602
Great thing
about assigning Taub
obviously fraudulent lab work

28:50.688 --> 28:53.145
is you get to watch
his inner paranoiac at work.

29:01.407 --> 29:02.647
And then,

29:04.035 --> 29:05.775
two to the head.

29:05.870 --> 29:07.326
Can we talk
about my patient?

29:07.455 --> 29:08.911
Quite a journey.

29:08.998 --> 29:10.909
Starts with a surgical
tool in your heart,

29:11.000 --> 29:12.911
and ends with
a surgeon's tool in a nun.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.076
What's the plan?
The plan's to cure her.

29:16.923 --> 29:20.165
If it's not meaningless sex,
kinda screams out
for an end-game.

29:20.259 --> 29:24.002
You're the dog that's
chasing the Popemobile.
You sure you want...

29:25.890 --> 29:26.970
Oh, my God.

29:30.019 --> 29:32.260
Taub is interrogating
the janitor.

29:32.396 --> 29:34.682
He must think that
I hired him to attack.

29:35.274 --> 29:38.016
Actually,
why didn't I do that?

29:39.362 --> 29:42.650
Plaques could be
confused for nodules.

29:42.740 --> 29:44.571
Which would mean...
Sypth?

29:45.409 --> 29:47.240
Explains the shoulder
and foot involvement.

29:48.412 --> 29:50.869
Hope you practiced
immaculate contraception.

29:56.128 --> 29:58.039
Lock and load.

30:00.049 --> 30:01.539
Boo-yah!

30:02.093 --> 30:03.082
(SPUTTERS)

30:04.887 --> 30:06.218
Boo-yah to you, too.

30:09.809 --> 30:11.970

30:12.061 --> 30:13.426
Tertiary syphilis
means you've had

30:13.562 --> 30:14.938
the disease for
at least that long.

30:15.606 --> 30:17.392
Does that mean
you also have it?

30:18.526 --> 30:20.812
Probably not
contagious at this point.

30:24.073 --> 30:25.734
Can it cause hallucinations?

30:26.575 --> 30:27.951
It's unlikely. Why?

30:30.663 --> 30:35.407
While I was on
the operating table,
it didn't feel like a dream,

30:35.501 --> 30:39.961
I saw the boy who
I was caring for,

30:40.965 --> 30:42.080
the one who died.

30:45.094 --> 30:47.176
He walked right up to me.

30:48.556 --> 30:50.262
What did he say?

30:50.349 --> 30:52.431
He just held my hand.

30:52.935 --> 30:55.096
It was like he forgave me.

30:57.023 --> 30:58.479
Do you think that's crazy?

31:00.192 --> 31:05.027
I think it should
give you solace,
help you to move on.

with your patient?

31:18.878 --> 31:19.958
You're off the case.

31:20.504 --> 31:22.665
I saved her
from brain damage.

31:22.757 --> 31:24.463
You think my judgment's
the least bit compromised?

31:24.550 --> 31:27.257
She's still sick.
If she dies, we'll be

31:27.344 --> 31:29.209
in the middle of
a brand new investigation.

31:29.305 --> 31:30.966
This is about you
covering your own ass?

31:31.265 --> 31:33.597
I gave you time, leeway,

31:34.143 --> 31:35.883
and you decided to do
whatever the hell you wanted.

31:35.978 --> 31:37.684
House can dance
all over the rules,

31:37.772 --> 31:39.637
gets me knifed,
and he gets a pass.

31:39.899 --> 31:41.480
I break a rule,
no one gets hurt,

31:41.609 --> 31:43.145
but you kick me
off my own case?

31:43.986 --> 31:45.817
Unfortunately, yes.

31:51.494 --> 31:53.826
I'm sorry.
I took that
scalpel for you.

31:53.913 --> 31:55.574
That's Why I did this.

31:56.832 --> 31:59.369
Three weeks ago,
you never would have
slept with a patient.

31:59.502 --> 32:02.039
And you never would have
operated on her after.

32:03.881 --> 32:05.121
You need help.

32:05.216 --> 32:08.708
I need to get away from House
and everything that
reminds me of him.

32:08.844 --> 32:12.257
By breaking the rules,
not caring what
anyone else thinks?

32:13.224 --> 32:15.886
You're gonna
get away from him
by turning into him?

32:17.186 --> 32:18.471

32:39.708 --> 32:41.164
What's wrong with my stomach?

32:41.293 --> 32:42.794
Nothing. This is your liver.

32:49.760 --> 32:52.923
The liver failure
could be from
intraoperative hypotension.

32:53.055 --> 32:55.512
Checked the anesthesia sheet,
pressure was fine throughout.

32:55.599 --> 32:56.588
Thrombus?

32:56.725 --> 32:59.387
That voice in the hall
that none of us
have any reason

32:59.478 --> 33:02.345
to be listening to is,
not surprisingly, wrong.

33:03.399 --> 33:04.935
Abdominal
ultrasound was negative.

33:05.067 --> 33:06.728
Then we have to
assume liver failure's

33:06.819 --> 33:08.901
just another symptom
of whatever she's got.

33:09.446 --> 33:12.438
Trousseau's
syndrome could send clots,
cause the ischemic foot,

33:12.575 --> 33:14.907
add the enlarged lymph node,
macrocytosis...

33:14.994 --> 33:16.905
Disseminated

33:17.830 --> 33:18.990
Wilson said it wasn't cancer.

33:19.081 --> 33:21.117
Wilson says it's
not breast cancer.

33:26.547 --> 33:28.003
Negative chest X-rays aren't.

33:28.090 --> 33:29.250
Then we've gotta biopsy.

33:29.341 --> 33:31.832
Yeah, Foreman's
clearly wrong.

33:31.927 --> 33:34.088
You're clearly not
grasping at straws,

33:34.180 --> 33:36.262
because you're clearly not
emotionally involved.

33:36.932 --> 33:38.718
I know you want to
believe this is something

33:38.809 --> 33:42.472
we can cure.
It's not. I'm sorry.

33:54.533 --> 33:57.070
How soon will they
know if it's cancer?

33:57.161 --> 33:58.822
Within hours.

33:59.955 --> 34:01.286
And if it is?

34:03.042 --> 34:04.373
There's always chemo.

34:05.669 --> 34:07.705
You say that like
it's not gonna work.

34:09.173 --> 34:10.458
It could extend your life.

34:11.258 --> 34:12.589

34:18.140 --> 34:19.801
I'll be here as
much as you need.

You still never told me
why you left the seminary.

got me with a rake.

34:43.999 --> 34:45.785
Why didn't you
tell me that before?

34:45.876 --> 34:47.537
Because it was so shallow.

34:47.670 --> 34:51.162
I wasn't exactly
wrestling with great
theological questions.

34:52.174 --> 34:53.505
I don't believe that.

34:54.176 --> 34:55.916
You don't sleep with
the groundskeeper's wife,

34:56.011 --> 34:59.378
not unless you're
struggling with
whether you belong there.

35:03.227 --> 35:07.721

Would've made my life
a lot easier.

35:18.784 --> 35:20.649
Are you having trouble
talking, like before?

35:22.913 --> 35:25.199
I can get the words out...

35:25.624 --> 35:27.535
Just feels heavy when I do.

35:59.408 --> 36:02.525

36:17.259 --> 36:18.339
that I can get
out of here soon.

I spoke to the prioress...

36:37.780 --> 36:38.895
You're going back?

36:39.740 --> 36:41.105
I felt the calling.

36:42.117 --> 36:43.232
When you saw the boy?

36:43.577 --> 36:48.913
I felt God's love, his grace.
I've been waiting my
entire life for that.

36:48.999 --> 36:50.239
It's not real.

36:50.334 --> 36:53.451
I know you
didn't feel anything
when you almost died. I did.

36:53.545 --> 36:58.039
You felt oxygen deprivation,
you felt your brain
releasing noradrenaline.

36:58.634 --> 36:59.999
You didn't say that before.

37:00.511 --> 37:03.503
I wanted you to
move on with your life.

37:03.597 --> 37:06.464

I wanted you to feel better.

She did.
She wants to go
back to the monastery.

37:36.630 --> 37:39.121
And now you're preparing
a PowerPoint presentation

37:39.216 --> 37:42.333
to keep her in your garden
of earthly delights.

37:42.428 --> 37:44.259
You're an idiot.

37:44.888 --> 37:46.719
Because I've
found someone I love?

37:46.849 --> 37:48.680
Because you're an idiot.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.928
At least you two
have that in common.

37:51.019 --> 37:54.011
Her feelings are based on
a chemical process.
They're gonna wear off.

37:54.481 --> 37:58.315
You just slept with her,
your brain is
exploding with oxytocin.

37:58.402 --> 38:00.017
You think that's gonna last
through the ages?

38:00.112 --> 38:02.319
She's throwing away her life
because of blind faith.

38:02.406 --> 38:03.521
So are you.

38:04.783 --> 38:07.320
She's found something
she wants to build
her life around.

38:07.828 --> 38:09.864
It's a total illusion,
but apparently she'll take

38:09.955 --> 38:11.161
a little ignorance
with her bliss.

38:11.248 --> 38:12.784
And you want to
take that away.

38:12.875 --> 38:15.332
How many times have
you thrown the truth
in people's faces?

38:15.419 --> 38:17.125
Because it's the truth.
Not because

38:17.254 --> 38:18.994
we're gonna live
happily ever after.

38:20.757 --> 38:23.043
Either your
relationship just blows up

38:23.218 --> 38:25.504
like every other
non-magical romance,

38:25.596 --> 38:27.382
or she stays with you
but blames you for

38:27.473 --> 38:29.509
stripping all
the meaning out of her life.

38:29.850 --> 38:32.842
This has nothing to
do with the truth.

38:35.564 --> 38:38.021

change it, that I can.

Anyone can screw up a life.
I never said that
wasn't possible.

38:41.278 --> 38:43.269
You're incapable
of human connection,

38:43.405 --> 38:45.441
so you want
everyone to be like you.

If I wanted you
to be like me,

38:53.081 --> 38:57.415

you to make a stupid,
stubborn decision

38:57.503 --> 39:00.370
that blows up your
life and leaves you
lonely and miserable.
