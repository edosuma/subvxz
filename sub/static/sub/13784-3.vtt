WEBVTT

00:07.049 --> 00:09.302
(theme music playing )

01:39.308 --> 01:42.391
(soft groaning )

01:50.486 --> 01:53.148
You want to know when
we're gonna open, Tess?

01:53.322 --> 01:56.860
Well, we're gonna open when me
and Johnny fucking say so!

01:57.034 --> 02:01.369
And you three, hovering around
like buzzards outside Al's door,

02:01.539 --> 02:03.826
will not hasten the situation.

02:06.836 --> 02:10.169
It was fucking sun up
before Al called it quits.

02:10.339 --> 02:12.421
Now he has earned a sleeping-in.

02:14.593 --> 02:18.461
He locks the door, Dan,
when he leaves his office.

02:18.639 --> 02:21.347
Al does not lock the door
when he's inside.

02:21.517 --> 02:25.181
That's just the exception
that proves the fucking rule.

02:25.354 --> 02:27.686
I suppose.

02:30.192 --> 02:32.809
EB: May I ask, Mr. Wolcott,
what purpose

02:32.987 --> 02:35.319
- draws you to our Hills?
- Gold.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.400
Gold? I see.

02:37.575 --> 02:39.441
- Morning, Mr. Utter.
- Morning.

02:39.618 --> 02:42.451
Frequents my buffet religiously.

02:42.621 --> 02:45.704
Yes, I hope to locate and secure
an assortment of claims.

02:45.875 --> 02:47.707
An assortment?

02:47.877 --> 02:49.538
Shrewd hedging--

02:49.712 --> 02:52.170
which makes me think
this is not your first foray.

02:52.340 --> 02:54.707
If it was, I don't suppose
I'd admit it to you.

02:54.884 --> 02:58.673
Only confirming
my original impression.

02:58.846 --> 03:01.713
Get his luggage.

03:03.017 --> 03:05.725
My staff will install
your possessions.

03:05.895 --> 03:07.385
I thank you.

03:13.110 --> 03:15.101
You bought provisions.

03:15.279 --> 03:19.238
During the night... while I was
waiting for you to come home.

03:20.659 --> 03:22.491
It's a 24-hour camp.

03:22.661 --> 03:24.868
So I saw.

03:28.542 --> 03:31.785
Certain things
I said yesterday I regret.

03:31.962 --> 03:35.330
I will be grateful
if you'd not rely on them.

03:36.634 --> 03:38.341
All right.

03:38.511 --> 03:41.594
Representations I made
as to letters I'd written--

03:41.764 --> 03:44.347
I didn't.

03:44.517 --> 03:47.054
I'll be grateful then

03:47.228 --> 03:51.096
if you not rely on my--
assurance that I got them.

03:51.273 --> 03:53.435
All right.

03:54.777 --> 03:57.018
I'll hold my deepest gratitude,
Mr. Bullock,

03:57.196 --> 04:00.314
for what will let us live
as we are now.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.736
This oatmeal looks old.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.406
It does, doesn't it?
Richardson, God damn you!

04:09.583 --> 04:13.121
- The oatmeal is clotted.
- It's 45 minutes yet till the three hours.

04:13.295 --> 04:15.957
Stop spouting gibberish
and replace the damned oatmeal.

04:16.132 --> 04:18.123
I'll make do with the bacon.

04:24.598 --> 04:28.307
A camp like this,
one draws one's menials

04:28.477 --> 04:30.855
from a small and brackish pool.

04:34.442 --> 04:36.683
Once the pig is digested,

04:36.861 --> 04:40.024
perhaps we could pursue
a possibility that's come to mind.

04:40.197 --> 04:42.404
If the spirit still moves in you, sure.

04:42.575 --> 04:45.112
Maybe we could do it now?

04:45.286 --> 04:48.654
Wolcott:
No. Let's let your mind

04:48.831 --> 04:51.573
ripen and mature
the possibility first.

04:52.918 --> 04:56.502
The creature I saw outside
our place last night,

04:56.672 --> 04:59.164
who you said is the camp's mayor,

04:59.341 --> 05:02.675
now perches like a vulture
over that man at breakfast.

05:02.845 --> 05:06.554
- Of course. Certainly.
- Farnum. He owns the hotel.

05:06.724 --> 05:08.840
Have you affection
for Mayor Farnum?

05:09.018 --> 05:10.634
- None.
- Good.

05:10.811 --> 05:14.475
Because the man the mayor
expects to digest

05:14.648 --> 05:18.061
is going to toy and play
with Mr. Farnum

05:18.235 --> 05:22.103
from camouflage for as long
as he finds it amusing.

05:22.281 --> 05:25.945
And then make him a meal of his own.

05:26.118 --> 05:29.327
- Who is the man?
- A trick.

05:29.497 --> 05:31.829
A specialist.

05:31.999 --> 05:37.460
Who asks to be called Mr. W.

05:41.592 --> 05:44.880
-( Knocks)
- EB Farnum demanding entry.

05:53.312 --> 05:56.304
- Summon Al.
- He's not summonable.

05:56.482 --> 05:58.723
For the news I bear,
he'll be plenty summonable.

05:58.901 --> 06:02.110
Why don't you go on up
and summon him yourself, EB?

06:02.279 --> 06:03.895
Happily.

06:05.241 --> 06:07.323
He's behind lock and key.

06:07.493 --> 06:11.361
You're certain he's within?

06:11.539 --> 06:14.531
Called out to my knock,
said, "Get the fuck away."

06:14.708 --> 06:20.169
Fornication demanding
discretion or a bribe.

06:20.339 --> 06:22.501
He's fucking alone,
and he's gonna stay that way

06:22.675 --> 06:26.543
- until he chooses to be otherwise.
- I think he's fucking poorly.

06:28.013 --> 06:30.300
His voice has got a gravelly timbre.

06:32.560 --> 06:36.428
- Want to leave a message?
- In fact, I do. Yes.

06:37.731 --> 06:41.099
"Al, if you're not dead
and already moldering,

06:41.277 --> 06:44.065
I send news to revive you.

06:44.238 --> 06:47.776
A fish to rival the fabled Leviathan

06:47.950 --> 06:50.112
has swum into our waters.

06:50.286 --> 06:52.994
Get well soon and we will land
the cocksucker together.

06:53.163 --> 06:55.325
Your friend, EB."

07:00.004 --> 07:04.544
You might add as a postscript,
"I also have the news

07:04.717 --> 07:09.803
you dispatched me to secure
of the newly-arrived cunt." Please.

07:13.100 --> 07:16.309
- You just move here?
- Just yesterday.

07:16.478 --> 07:19.891
I watched the sheriff
build this house.

07:20.065 --> 07:22.272
Mr. Bullock's my pa's brother,

07:22.443 --> 07:24.434
that married my mom
when my pa got killed.

07:24.612 --> 07:27.821
So now he's my pa and my uncle.

07:27.990 --> 07:31.324
Big trout lives in that deep part
down there.

07:31.493 --> 07:33.951
- Damon!
- Coming.

07:34.121 --> 07:38.206
My pa and me are going
to grow apples in Oregon.

07:38.375 --> 07:39.957
Will you come back?

07:40.127 --> 07:43.085
Pa says we ain't
never coming back.

07:44.715 --> 07:46.831
Keep your eye on that rainbow.

07:47.885 --> 07:49.626
I call him Jumbo.

07:56.435 --> 07:58.972
Ho hup.

08:02.900 --> 08:04.937
Morning, William.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.820
Morning, Mr. Bullock.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.822
You got your gun and badge back.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.984
I did. I put them in that basket
for you to see.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.994
Did you fight that man again?

08:17.164 --> 08:19.371
No. We didn't have to fight.

08:19.541 --> 08:21.919
That boy is going to Oregon.

08:26.715 --> 08:31.334
There's a trout that loiters
just downstream there.

08:31.512 --> 08:33.753
The boy calls him Jumbo.

08:39.645 --> 08:41.431
Maybe after work

08:41.605 --> 08:44.939
we can make him pay
for his slothful ways.

08:50.406 --> 08:52.272
(machinery clanging loudly)

08:59.581 --> 09:03.199
Alma: Does the scope
of the find, Mr. Ellsworth,

09:03.377 --> 09:08.622
warrant more than the five-stamp mill
we operate with now?

09:08.799 --> 09:10.540
Ellsworth:
Oh, no question, ma'am.

09:10.718 --> 09:13.927
Your holdings justify 25 stamps easy.

09:14.096 --> 09:17.214
Just a matter of waiting
till the legalities get resolved.

09:18.809 --> 09:22.097
And why would the purchase of
a larger machine await legal resolution?

09:22.271 --> 09:25.059
Well, ma'am, 'cause without title,

09:25.232 --> 09:29.647
you wouldn't own no quartz
for your 25-stamp machine to crush.

09:40.122 --> 09:42.329
- Good morning, Mr. Bullock.
- Good morning.

09:42.499 --> 09:44.831
- Good morning, Sofia.
- Good morning.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.828
Mrs. Garret has gone
to see her claim.

09:49.006 --> 09:50.462
Has she?

09:50.632 --> 09:52.669
- Yes, with Mr. Ellsworth.
- I see.

09:52.843 --> 09:56.052
She asked if I saw you,
please to give you this back.

09:57.181 --> 10:00.139
- Sofia can learn on another watch.
- All right.

10:03.353 --> 10:06.095
When opportunity permits,

10:06.273 --> 10:08.184
you might inquire of Mrs. Garret,

10:08.358 --> 10:11.100
as few children as are in the camp--

10:11.278 --> 10:12.985
I take your meaning, Mr. Bullock.

10:13.155 --> 10:15.112
If she decided it was appropriate,

10:15.282 --> 10:17.694
other parties would be
delighted and grateful.

10:17.868 --> 10:19.779
Yes, well, she will have
to decide that.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.205
Yes.

10:26.376 --> 10:28.413
The camp pugilist.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.963
Fond as I am of you, Joanie,

10:33.133 --> 10:35.295
I wouldn't have brought my girls

10:35.469 --> 10:36.959
and my own tired ass out here

10:37.137 --> 10:39.879
on just your kind invitation.

10:40.057 --> 10:42.890
The trick sweetened
the prospect-- Mr. W?

10:43.060 --> 10:45.848
Maddie: He offered on one
of my girls to bring her out here.

10:46.021 --> 10:51.562
Being as Mr. W is chief lookout
for George Hearst--

10:51.735 --> 10:54.818
that struck biggest
in the Comstock and Mexico--

10:54.988 --> 10:58.026
I knew he'd just endorse
the camp's future.

10:59.284 --> 11:03.403
Short side, Mr. W enjoys being
cranky with his women.

11:05.332 --> 11:08.916
But sometimes when disappointed
his crankiness runs away with him.

11:09.086 --> 11:11.999
What's gonna disappoint him?

11:13.006 --> 11:14.963
Devious sort that I am,

11:15.133 --> 11:18.922
I've got the girl
he's interested in on ice.

11:20.639 --> 11:22.095
Thank you.

11:22.266 --> 11:25.600
Mr. Wolcott, I'm the custodian--

11:25.769 --> 11:27.976
note I do not say owner--

11:28.146 --> 11:32.140
of Wild Bill Hickok's
final earthly communication.

11:36.613 --> 11:38.229
It's damp.

11:38.407 --> 11:40.114
Mr. Wolcott,

11:40.284 --> 11:43.652
not an hour before
giving me the letter,

11:43.829 --> 11:47.447
Bill confided to me,
having come upon a quartz deposit

11:47.624 --> 11:52.289
promising in Bill's own words
"wealth beyond counting."

11:52.462 --> 11:54.794
How much wealth is that?

11:54.965 --> 11:56.626
I don't know, Mr. Wolcott.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.007
I don't know how high
Bill could count.

11:59.177 --> 12:01.168
- How much do you want me to pay?
-( laughing )

12:01.346 --> 12:04.213
I'd hardly expect you
to pay anything,

12:04.391 --> 12:09.636
imagining rather
I will pay you your cost

12:09.813 --> 12:12.350
to see the letter

12:12.524 --> 12:15.061
delivered to its proper recipient.

12:16.153 --> 12:18.394
Plus $10G...

12:19.448 --> 12:24.409
set against whatever profits
you may generate...

12:24.578 --> 12:28.492
( groans ) should delivery
prove impossible...

12:29.791 --> 12:32.704
from the information
the letter contains.

12:32.878 --> 12:37.588
So this set-off
against profits I might gain

12:37.758 --> 12:41.092
in the event that this letter,
proving undeliverable,

12:41.261 --> 12:44.049
contains such valuable information,

12:44.222 --> 12:46.259
have you an amount in mind?

12:46.433 --> 12:47.969
$10,000.

12:48.143 --> 12:49.884
Less the $100
you would pay me?

12:50.062 --> 12:53.600
- Correct.
- $9900 net then, me to you.

12:53.774 --> 12:56.357
- Yes.
- And I would pay you that now

12:56.526 --> 12:58.608
before attempting
the letter's delivery?

12:58.779 --> 13:00.269
Oh, yes.

13:00.447 --> 13:03.439
Once you have the letter,
all my connection to it is severed.

13:03.617 --> 13:06.359
I see.

13:06.536 --> 13:09.665
To deliver it or not, or whatever
the hell you want to do.

13:09.831 --> 13:12.823
Well, you will have
my decision shortly.

13:13.001 --> 13:15.459
- Fine then.
- Uh, for the luggage.

13:15.629 --> 13:19.122
Oh no. I wouldn't hear of it.
It was my great pleasure.

13:19.299 --> 13:23.634
I trust I will, uh, hear from you soon.

13:25.722 --> 13:29.090
I see now what it takes
to bring you back into my life.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.475
Just passing through, Mr. Star.

13:32.646 --> 13:34.182
Even so,

13:34.356 --> 13:37.599
it makes a man glad he has
three limbs left to be damaged.

13:37.776 --> 13:39.858
Seth: Morning.

13:45.242 --> 13:48.451
A man can get me in his life
with five bucks.

13:48.620 --> 13:51.578
$2, if he just needs a handshake.

13:51.748 --> 13:54.490
( Clears throat )
Good morning.

13:54.668 --> 13:57.251
- Morning.
- Seth: Morning.

13:59.589 --> 14:02.718
Trixie!

14:02.884 --> 14:04.340
Many thanks.

14:06.722 --> 14:08.338
Ah.

14:24.406 --> 14:26.443
How bad does that pain?

14:26.616 --> 14:28.994
- It's all right.
- I'm in my house, Sol.

14:29.161 --> 14:33.120
- With Martha and the boy?
- Chose not to put 'em in the thoroughfare.

14:34.458 --> 14:36.290
Or, I see what you're asking.

14:36.460 --> 14:39.998
Far as her having a different opinion
possibly once I showed up--

14:40.172 --> 14:42.004
no, she chose to stay.

14:42.174 --> 14:45.041
Well, good.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.470
Anyways, could you open up?

14:50.640 --> 14:52.802
Sure. Glad to.

14:52.976 --> 14:54.842
Any help with your person?

14:55.020 --> 14:57.057
No, I'm all right.

15:00.859 --> 15:04.022
Swearengen said county commissioners
are all from Yankton.

15:04.196 --> 15:06.028
When was this?

15:07.240 --> 15:09.231
Just before we hit the mud.

15:12.829 --> 15:15.571
It's wrong the Hills get
no representation.

15:15.749 --> 15:20.118
Even in an Eden like this,
wrongs sometimes occur.

15:23.381 --> 15:27.215
I meant maybe we should try
to do something about it.

15:27.385 --> 15:29.171
I'm with you.

15:29.346 --> 15:31.257
Doc: God damn it, Al!

15:31.431 --> 15:35.516
Such as they are, my arts cannot
be practiced at this remove.

15:39.147 --> 15:41.104
Stop being a babY!

15:43.693 --> 15:46.435
( Softly )
Any secrets

15:46.613 --> 15:50.698
that you feel need keeping
will not be betrayed by me.

15:50.867 --> 15:53.325
Doc.

15:53.495 --> 15:55.327
Trixie.

15:57.499 --> 16:00.241
Rest, uninterrupted.

16:00.418 --> 16:03.661
No visits, no exception.

16:07.342 --> 16:09.925
From his fray with Bullock he's poorly,

16:10.095 --> 16:12.086
or his trouble with his prick?

16:12.264 --> 16:16.758
If you can get him
to grant you entry,

16:16.935 --> 16:19.927
maybe you will confide that to me.

16:36.705 --> 16:41.996
It's Trixie-- that's overheard
the doc's instruction.

16:42.169 --> 16:46.163
So let me just shout
my information from here.

16:46.339 --> 16:49.047
- Nobody is dead.
- ( wheezing )

16:49.217 --> 16:51.754
Bullock's gone
to that house he built.

16:51.928 --> 16:54.511
Star is on his feet,

16:54.681 --> 16:56.763
more or less.

16:59.603 --> 17:02.891
Anyways,
I'm gonna stay on the ear

17:03.064 --> 17:05.021
over to the hardware store.

17:07.152 --> 17:09.519
Yeah.

17:13.366 --> 17:17.451
Fucking telegraph poles, Al,

17:17.621 --> 17:21.454
are next thing to landed
in the fucking thoroughfare.

17:22.751 --> 17:25.492
Next leap of the creature,
they'll be here.

17:34.179 --> 17:36.045
All right, Al.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.429
(whimpering)

17:46.816 --> 17:49.274
- Where's fucking Dolly?
- Fucking.

17:49.444 --> 17:51.481
- When was she last with him?
- Daybreak,

17:51.655 --> 17:54.147
just before he give
Bullock back his iron.

17:54.324 --> 17:56.782
We've seen him after she did.

17:58.328 --> 18:00.239
You brew him my fucking tea.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.154
Put it on a tray, you take it up to him

18:02.332 --> 18:04.699
- and make him fucking drink it.
- All right.

18:04.876 --> 18:07.789
If he don't present himself
in a few hours,

18:07.963 --> 18:11.752
kick down the door and get
the fucking doc in there.

18:32.862 --> 18:35.820
I'm Lila. Welcome to the Bella Union.

18:35.991 --> 18:37.527
I'm Francis Wolcott,

18:37.701 --> 18:40.363
which I would be grateful
if you would tell your employer.

18:40.537 --> 18:42.904
This is Francis Wolcott, Cy.

18:44.207 --> 18:48.701
Cy Tolliver, Mr. Wolcott. How do you do...
and what will you drink?

18:48.878 --> 18:52.291
- Kentucky bourbon if you've got it.
- Pour Mr. Wolcott a bourbon, Jack,

18:52.465 --> 18:55.048
- and tell him it's from Kentucky.
- Kentucky bourbon.

18:55.218 --> 18:56.959
- Straight up?
- Please.

18:57.137 --> 18:59.595
Shall we have Lila drink with us,

18:59.764 --> 19:02.096
or would you like
to drink with Lila alone?

19:02.267 --> 19:05.385
I would rather we two
converse privately.

19:10.108 --> 19:13.521
Just talk now, sir?
I'm not that kind of fella.

19:13.695 --> 19:16.312
Maybe you're just waiting
for the right offer.

19:16.489 --> 19:20.403
It's late in the game,
but I suppose anything is possible.

19:20.577 --> 19:22.909
Will you take the air?

19:24.831 --> 19:29.041
If I'm to lose my virtue,
I'd as soon do it outside these walls.

19:31.755 --> 19:33.666
You approached a group in San Francisco

19:33.840 --> 19:35.626
that does business with my employer.

19:35.800 --> 19:39.259
That group and employer bullshit
really quickens me with fucking trust.

19:39.429 --> 19:43.263
That group you've approached
is a fraternal Chinese organization.

19:43.433 --> 19:45.891
"Tong" is not a clever enough word?

19:46.061 --> 19:48.723
You offered them a contract
to send members to this camp.

19:48.897 --> 19:52.856
That organization has a preexisting
arrangement with my employer.

19:53.026 --> 19:55.893
So you work for who, Wolcott?
The railroads,

19:56.071 --> 20:00.235
some mining combination that brings
those slant-eyes in by the boatload?

20:00.408 --> 20:02.524
No, sir. I work for one man.

20:02.702 --> 20:06.286
Jesus Christ.
Doesn't every one of us?

20:06.456 --> 20:08.618
George Hearst.

20:13.463 --> 20:15.955
I meant no disrespect of any kind

20:16.132 --> 20:20.046
to you or Mr. Hearst by any word I've said
from the moment we have met.

20:20.220 --> 20:21.961
I understand that.

20:22.138 --> 20:24.470
I have nothing but
respect for Mr. Hearst.

20:24.641 --> 20:26.302
He's in the Comstock and Montana,

20:26.476 --> 20:30.140
every other place he's ever operated,
without jape or jest.

20:30.313 --> 20:33.146
And the overture you made
to the group in San Francisco

20:33.316 --> 20:37.605
showed imagination and foresight
and a tolerance for risk

20:37.779 --> 20:39.861
that was impressive to Mr. Hearst.

20:40.031 --> 20:41.647
We want to work with you here.

20:42.992 --> 20:45.484
- You do?
- Yes, we do.

20:49.165 --> 20:51.372
Con Stapleton, Leon!

20:52.377 --> 20:54.368
Get over here and meet
a fucking gentleman.

20:54.546 --> 20:58.130
Those two work for me now
among the Celestials,

20:58.299 --> 21:03.135
setting up that miserable cocksucker
to get knocked off his high horse.

21:03.304 --> 21:06.171
- Con, Leon.
- I don't want to meet them.

21:07.809 --> 21:10.096
Go inside.

21:10.270 --> 21:12.307
Meet me inside.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.062
Yes, sir.

21:14.232 --> 21:15.814
Yes, sir, Mr. Tolliver.

21:15.984 --> 21:17.600
Just go on in, fellas.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.768
My only contact is with you.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.653
As far as they're concerned,

21:21.823 --> 21:23.609
you and Mr. Hearst don't even exist.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.615
As far as you're concerned, Cy,

21:25.785 --> 21:28.026
in the tasks you'll
be performing for him,

21:28.204 --> 21:30.491
Mr. Hearst doesn't either.

21:31.499 --> 21:33.786
Who?

21:38.548 --> 21:41.040
Wake up.
Take account you're indoors.

21:48.725 --> 21:50.557
Here.

21:53.521 --> 21:55.478
That's water now.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.764
Get it the fuck away from me then.

21:57.942 --> 22:00.058
Drink it and don't be stupid.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.817
Oh, Christ, are we arrested?

22:07.994 --> 22:10.907
I explained all this to you, Jane,

22:11.080 --> 22:13.117
that I'm the fucking deputy,

22:13.291 --> 22:17.034
and I fixed up the overflow cell
in case you come back.

22:17.212 --> 22:18.498
Shut up then.

22:18.671 --> 22:23.211
You replied I was boring the shit out of you
'cause Doc already told you all about it.

22:23.384 --> 22:26.342
Well, evidently,
I don't remember fuck-all.

22:26.513 --> 22:30.848
No. 'Cause after every other fucking thing
we went through last night,

22:31.017 --> 22:34.351
you got to make us stop at that
new joint across from Nuttall's.

22:34.521 --> 22:38.606
Would you kindly shut
your fucking mouth?

22:44.447 --> 22:47.189
Hey, what the fuck's
Bill's coat doing here?

22:52.247 --> 22:56.286
Well, he wouldn't have seen it
useless or a souvenir.

22:58.002 --> 23:02.212
I figured I'd give it work
keeping the bed warm.

23:02.382 --> 23:05.340
Uh, where is it headed

23:05.510 --> 23:07.592
now I'm the occupant?

23:07.762 --> 23:10.424
It ain't going anywheres.

23:16.437 --> 23:18.474
Thank you, Charlie.

23:25.280 --> 23:27.863
It's cool. Sit outside.

23:34.205 --> 23:36.116
Wide knees.

23:39.961 --> 23:42.544
Are we gonna argue?

23:42.714 --> 23:45.046
We're partners, ain't we, Maddie?

23:45.216 --> 23:48.800
Ain't that a lot of planning and thinking
to not let your partner in on?

23:48.970 --> 23:52.053
Not sharing it before I even knew
the trick was in camp

23:52.223 --> 23:53.930
don't put me wrong, Joanie.

23:54.100 --> 23:58.139
It don't put you right,
far as an atmosphere of trust.

23:58.313 --> 24:01.055
Joanie, was there any odds
when me and my girls got out here

24:01.232 --> 24:03.724
that you might have told us
you'd changed your mind?

24:03.901 --> 24:06.814
I guess there was a chance.

24:06.988 --> 24:09.730
Or I'd have found you dead
or moved along?

24:09.907 --> 24:11.739
No chance on moved along.

24:11.909 --> 24:13.991
Only way to guarantee
an outcome, honey,

24:14.162 --> 24:15.903
is contracting to be fucked.

24:16.080 --> 24:18.822
Everything else is a chance,

24:19.000 --> 24:22.959
including me letting you down.

24:25.214 --> 24:30.004
But if I do, using my head
won't be the tip-off.

24:33.097 --> 24:35.680
How will you bring the girl into it?

24:35.850 --> 24:38.683
At the trick's fierce insistence.

24:38.853 --> 24:40.639
What's our split?

24:40.813 --> 24:42.975
50-50.

24:44.359 --> 24:46.441
What's the girl's end?

24:46.611 --> 24:49.399
I wouldn't rule out a wooden box.

24:54.369 --> 24:55.859
Timely purchase.

24:56.037 --> 24:57.698
That's our last in stock.

25:00.375 --> 25:02.707
Goddamn out-thinking myself--

25:02.877 --> 25:04.959
resupplying in smaller orders.

25:05.129 --> 25:07.962
You've been dealing
with a few uncertainties.

25:08.132 --> 25:09.998
If the claims get allowed or they don't,

25:10.176 --> 25:14.135
or Yankton stacks the commissioners or not,
we're either in business or we ain't,

25:14.305 --> 25:17.013
and if we are, you reduce costs
buying in volume.

25:17.183 --> 25:21.142
- Your old man?
- On his death bed in fucking Vienna.

25:22.772 --> 25:24.683
Fellas.

25:24.857 --> 25:27.110
- On the mend?
- Doing better, thank you.

25:27.276 --> 25:29.404
Hope you are too.

25:29.570 --> 25:33.689
We was gonna thin these inquiries yesterday
before that trouble with Bummer Dan.

25:33.866 --> 25:36.608
We've been gonna thin them
for several weeks.

25:36.786 --> 25:39.153
Is Farnum's slop-house okay?

25:39.330 --> 25:42.197
Jane is sleeping
a load off in my place.

25:45.628 --> 25:48.086
Inquiries from other jurisdictions.

25:48.256 --> 25:50.088
We've been somewhat remiss.

25:50.258 --> 25:52.545
Whose that fella said
"Never put off till tomorrow

25:52.719 --> 25:55.256
- what will wait till the day after"?
- Not my old man.

26:03.146 --> 26:06.264
- To buy the Hickok letter.
- Wonderful.

26:07.650 --> 26:09.436
I'll have a bill of sale.

26:09.610 --> 26:11.772
Well, certainly, sir. Of course.

26:15.867 --> 26:19.360
For reasons of legal nicety,

26:19.537 --> 26:22.404
we'll say you're purchasing
the right to deliver.

26:25.668 --> 26:28.626
You got to let me get
to your piss-pot, Al.

26:30.381 --> 26:32.588
Otherwise, when your mood changes,

26:32.759 --> 26:35.126
you're fucking gonna yell
at me for not doing it.

26:37.013 --> 26:39.505
I think I should get the doc, Al.

26:39.682 --> 26:43.050
You need to let the doc in.

26:43.227 --> 26:46.595
You need to let him see to you.

26:46.773 --> 26:49.140
When I was sick, the doc helped me.

26:49.317 --> 26:53.857
And you ain't fucking yelled
since then my foot's dragging.

26:55.573 --> 26:57.655
Fuck this, right, Doc?

26:57.825 --> 26:59.816
- Fuck it.
- Dan!

27:00.870 --> 27:03.111
You need to fucking
break the door down!

27:03.289 --> 27:05.701
- Dan: Now?
- Isn't that what I just fucking said?

27:08.419 --> 27:10.330
- Dan: Al!
- If I was you, Doc,

27:10.505 --> 27:12.291
I would get out of the fucking way!

27:12.465 --> 27:15.548
Ow! Jesus fucking Christ!

27:20.056 --> 27:22.844
- You all right?
- Mm, I think I broke my fucking shoulder.

27:23.017 --> 27:25.179
Would you open up my case?

27:25.353 --> 27:27.185
Al?

27:28.356 --> 27:30.347
Al, Al?

27:33.444 --> 27:35.481
(whimpers)

27:38.574 --> 27:41.362
- Do we need to get him laudanum?
- Please.

27:43.538 --> 27:46.371
All right, Al.

27:46.541 --> 27:50.079
All right. It's all right.

27:50.253 --> 27:52.711
Seth: "Please don't let up
on the Stackpole case,

27:52.880 --> 27:54.746
as I'm sure he's out there."

27:56.384 --> 27:59.718
- No idea.
- I never heard of it either.

27:59.887 --> 28:02.174
All the portions
you had on your plate,

28:02.348 --> 28:06.057
- I hesitated to fucking inquire.
- I couldn't have helped if you had.

28:06.227 --> 28:07.717
Fuck the Stackpole case then,

28:07.895 --> 28:10.227
and the letter from Arapaho County
concerning it,

28:10.398 --> 28:12.514
which goes in the fucked-case file.

28:14.527 --> 28:16.894
Alma: I'd like to buy
Mr. Farnum's hotel.

28:17.071 --> 28:18.607
To do what with, Mrs. Garret?

28:18.781 --> 28:21.022
To renovate
and make my residence.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.659
I can think of
better locations, ma'am,

28:24.829 --> 28:27.321
with friendlier views.

28:27.498 --> 28:30.365
None that would offer
the further pleasure

28:30.543 --> 28:33.205
of putting Mr. Farnum
in the thoroughfare.

28:33.379 --> 28:37.338
I expect a man like Farnum
finds quarters pretty easy.

28:37.508 --> 28:40.170
I would expect even
with his venality satisfied,

28:40.344 --> 28:45.214
a man like Farnum would feel himself
dispossessed and unanchored.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.098
I think he'd be very sad.

28:47.268 --> 28:50.260
And I would like to see him
in that condition.

28:52.064 --> 28:54.852
I guess most of us got enough luck

28:55.026 --> 28:57.267
to be too broke to act
on them type ideas.

28:57.445 --> 28:59.937
What type ideas do you refer to?

29:00.114 --> 29:04.824
The type the lowborn would say
we get when we're pissed off.

29:04.994 --> 29:06.826
Although...

29:06.996 --> 29:09.488
my own aristocratic lineage

29:09.665 --> 29:14.250
causes me to use the term
"sore-disappointed."

29:16.464 --> 29:18.876
I am pissed off.

29:19.050 --> 29:22.588
Well, last turns the wheel
has took for you, ma'am,

29:22.762 --> 29:24.924
I would say you've come by it honest.

29:26.140 --> 29:28.632
If punching somebody
in the nose would help,

29:28.809 --> 29:32.052
I'll volunteer one
that's well broke in.

29:48.788 --> 29:50.779
Safely returned.

30:05.012 --> 30:08.050
- Is he here too?
- No.

30:10.893 --> 30:12.554
He's my friend, Trixie.

30:12.728 --> 30:14.765
Among other fucking things.

30:20.111 --> 30:21.818
Anyways...

30:23.197 --> 30:26.235
I wonder could you
teach me to do accounts?

30:26.409 --> 30:28.275
All right.

30:28.452 --> 30:29.863
<i>I'll pay Yo"-</i>

30:30.037 --> 30:32.495
Or you can take it out in cunt.

30:33.874 --> 30:36.536
I won't teach you
if you keep that up.

30:36.711 --> 30:39.203
Fuck every fucking one of you.

30:39.380 --> 30:41.542
I wish I was a fucking tree.

30:47.680 --> 30:49.170
( Door slams)

30:49.348 --> 30:51.589
Mr. Wolcott.

30:51.767 --> 30:52.882
Mr. Farnum.

30:53.060 --> 30:55.722
The contents of that letter
are a deep disappointment.

30:55.896 --> 30:58.388
Not a word of any find
or promising location.

30:58.566 --> 31:00.102
You opened it then?

31:00.276 --> 31:01.937
Are you trifling with me?

31:03.904 --> 31:08.444
It occurs to me, sir, this conversation
were best had elsewhere.

31:08.617 --> 31:12.360
- But not postponed?
- Not postponed, Mr. Wolcott, no.

31:14.331 --> 31:15.947
We are men, sir.

31:16.125 --> 31:20.119
When we disagree,
we come to resolution promptly.

31:20.296 --> 31:22.708
- Where are we going?
- The Gem Saloon.

31:22.882 --> 31:26.591
- It's just over there.
- Please take your hand off my shoulder.

31:26.761 --> 31:30.880
Some ancient Italian maxim

31:31.057 --> 31:33.674
fits our situation,

31:33.851 --> 31:36.559
whose particulars escape me.

31:36.729 --> 31:39.187
Is the gist that I'm shit out of luck?

31:39.356 --> 31:41.768
Did they speak that way then?

31:44.862 --> 31:47.650
( Al shrieks )
Oh, for the love of God!

31:51.702 --> 31:53.158
Please, won't you sit down?

31:53.329 --> 31:55.491
So you would have me
take the experience

31:55.664 --> 31:57.792
then as a lesson, dearly purchased?

32:00.920 --> 32:03.002
EB:
I should tell you, Mr. Wolcott,

32:03.172 --> 32:05.413
I have seen men in this very camp,

32:05.591 --> 32:08.049
feeling themselves victimized,

32:08.219 --> 32:12.008
seek redress in fashions
I thought imprudent.

32:12.181 --> 32:15.594
- Violently, you mean?
- Thus, at the lesson,

32:15.768 --> 32:18.977
dearly bought
as you would have it,

32:19.146 --> 32:21.934
is where I would leave this business.

32:22.108 --> 32:25.442
In any case, I was an intermediary
in this transaction.

32:25.611 --> 32:28.319
Ah, then, having been a pupil,

32:28.489 --> 32:31.322
it falls to you now
to instruct your principal.

32:31.492 --> 32:33.733
I wonder, Mr. Wolcott,

32:33.911 --> 32:37.029
if some second letter
couldn't be drafted

32:37.206 --> 32:40.039
to put some sharper point
on the lesson,

32:40.209 --> 32:43.622
maybe remunerative to both of us.

32:43.796 --> 32:46.163
So your idea would be

32:46.340 --> 32:49.048
that we fuck Mr. Hearst twice?

32:49.218 --> 32:52.927
I missed the name, sir, but I can
aver as a general principle,

32:53.097 --> 32:56.010
my days of fucking anyone
are long in the past--

32:56.183 --> 32:58.345
whomever you represent.

32:58.519 --> 33:02.604
George Hearst, of the Ophir Find
in the Comstock.

33:02.773 --> 33:06.266
- Of course I know George Hearst.
- Oh, you know him personally?

33:06.443 --> 33:08.525
I do not know him personally,
not personally.

33:08.696 --> 33:11.529
- Oh.
- But of course I know of George Hearst

33:11.699 --> 33:14.532
and his reputation
and accomplishments and wealth,

33:14.702 --> 33:16.864
and his power and reputation.

33:17.037 --> 33:20.655
And I would say, as well,
most importantly,

33:20.833 --> 33:23.074
I have nothing to teach that man.

33:23.252 --> 33:26.461
George Hearst need learn
no lesson from me.

33:26.630 --> 33:29.543
Nor would I permit him
entrance into a lesson,

33:29.717 --> 33:31.924
either inadvertently or by accident,

33:32.094 --> 33:35.632
I wouldn't subsequently and immediately
cancel him back out of.

33:35.806 --> 33:38.298
Or his agent or intermediary.

33:38.475 --> 33:42.935
Mr. Hearst doesn't
renege on contracts.

33:45.065 --> 33:47.318
Then what am I to do?

33:47.484 --> 33:49.862
What am I to do, Mr. Wolcott,

33:50.029 --> 33:55.149
but to admit a terrible
and tragic miscalculation,

33:55.326 --> 33:58.239
supplicate myself and beg mercy

33:58.412 --> 34:00.904
and understanding and forgiveness?

34:01.081 --> 34:03.413
And to aver,
if you would contemplate

34:03.584 --> 34:06.622
any separate or side transaction
or understanding...

34:06.795 --> 34:09.172
Remove your hand from my forearm.

34:09.340 --> 34:11.422
Do not touch me again.

34:11.592 --> 34:14.425
I look poor,

34:14.594 --> 34:17.804
but that is a cultivated pose
and posture.

34:17.973 --> 34:19.589
I am not poor and I am not stingy

34:19.766 --> 34:21.929
when fundamental interests
are at stake--

34:22.937 --> 34:24.928
as a complete aside.

34:27.440 --> 34:30.433
There is a service
you could do Mr. Hearst

34:30.610 --> 34:33.694
that would set off exactly
against the funds

34:33.864 --> 34:36.150
he might otherwise
believe you fleeced him of.

34:36.324 --> 34:38.032
Anything, sir.

34:38.202 --> 34:41.614
This service would enlist
you and one or two others,

34:41.789 --> 34:45.453
circulating certain rumors
about the future of the camp.

34:45.626 --> 34:47.788
In particular about the validity

34:47.962 --> 34:49.998
of the present titles to the claims.

34:51.840 --> 34:54.377
Done. Consider me enlisted.

34:54.551 --> 34:57.384
Consider the validity
called into question.

34:58.472 --> 35:02.807
I also wish to know the location
of your highest-end brothel.

35:02.977 --> 35:05.309
As it happens,

35:05.479 --> 35:08.938
a whorehouse succeeding
to that title has just opened.

35:09.108 --> 35:11.566
Nothing just happens, Mr. Farnum.

35:13.362 --> 35:15.603
Shhh.

35:17.700 --> 35:20.158
Do you think this hat
makes my head look big?

35:20.327 --> 35:22.318
No, sir.

35:22.496 --> 35:25.659
It makes your head look
the perfect size.

35:26.667 --> 35:28.408
Thank you.

35:42.850 --> 35:44.807
(Sighs)

35:48.731 --> 35:51.063
You're gonna find out
something now

35:51.233 --> 35:54.601
about yourselves
and your fellow man:

35:54.778 --> 35:58.396
how you handle adversity--

35:58.574 --> 36:00.941
or rumors of adversity

36:01.118 --> 36:03.780
or ill fortune or turns of luck.

36:03.954 --> 36:07.413
And I'm not going to further
rumor or be a party to that bullshit.

36:07.583 --> 36:09.369
You want to know where I stand?

36:09.543 --> 36:11.875
You just look the fuck
where I'm standing.

36:12.046 --> 36:14.162
You'll find out all you need to know.

36:15.174 --> 36:16.835
I ain't going anywhere!

36:17.009 --> 36:20.968
And if anyone else wants to,
two weeks fucking severance is

36:21.138 --> 36:24.130
waiting for you right fucking now.
You step the fuck up!

36:24.308 --> 36:26.675
Step right the fuck up!

36:30.606 --> 36:32.813
Now that shows me something.

36:32.983 --> 36:35.224
But any time, day or night,

36:35.402 --> 36:38.394
anyone wants to fucking waver
or fucking change their minds,

36:38.572 --> 36:41.280
you just step right the fuck up
and get your severance.

36:46.246 --> 36:49.375
Let's open the fuck up and get it
while we can, all right?

36:49.541 --> 36:53.409
- Open up!
- Stapleton: Open up! You heard! Let's go!

36:59.093 --> 37:01.551
What are you gonna do to him?

37:01.720 --> 37:06.681
Pass this instrument through
his penis into his bladder.

37:06.850 --> 37:10.184
If he has stones, it will click
against the metal instrument.

37:10.354 --> 37:13.688
Assuming I can hear
the clicks above his screams,

37:13.857 --> 37:18.442
I will have identified
the cause of his obstruction.

37:18.612 --> 37:20.478
To what fucking end?

37:20.656 --> 37:23.648
To the end that if I think
he will die otherwise

37:23.826 --> 37:27.660
of cutting him open above the pubis
and taking out the stones.

37:28.705 --> 37:31.447
Which will probably kill him anyways.

37:32.960 --> 37:35.247
What shall I say to you, Trixie,

37:35.421 --> 37:39.710
that I'm sure of a happy outcome
for Al and every one of us?

37:45.597 --> 37:47.429
( Knock at door)

37:49.643 --> 37:51.475
Minute for us, Mr. Tolliver?

37:51.645 --> 37:53.431
What is it?

37:54.731 --> 37:56.859
Come in and shut the door.

38:06.452 --> 38:08.034
What the fuck is it?

38:08.203 --> 38:10.991
Anything you want to tell us, Mr. T?

38:11.165 --> 38:13.247
I told you all I want to tell you outside.

38:13.417 --> 38:15.829
Well, believe me, uh,

38:16.003 --> 38:18.461
you don't have waverers
standing in front of you,

38:18.630 --> 38:22.089
or doubters or, uh, anyone
looking for fucking severance.

38:22.259 --> 38:24.296
- Just the opposite.
- What does that mean?

38:24.470 --> 38:26.336
You looking for a raise?

38:27.764 --> 38:29.425
Uh, well, what's going on,

38:29.600 --> 38:32.513
I suppose is Leon's question,
Mr. Tolliver.

38:35.689 --> 38:40.479
The truth is my questions
is answered 90%.

38:40.652 --> 38:43.189
And as for the rest, I'm gonna
get good and fucking loaded

38:43.363 --> 38:44.945
and let the devil take the hindmost.

38:45.115 --> 38:47.698
If you fucking walk out of here,
us two are gonna have words.

38:47.868 --> 38:49.905
And more than words
at my first opportunity,

38:50.078 --> 38:53.321
because this was 90%
his idea to come in here.

38:53.499 --> 38:55.866
Somebody better turn over a hole card.

38:59.880 --> 39:04.795
Both of us took a real
positive impression, sir,

39:04.968 --> 39:07.630
of the talk you give us
just recently here in your office.

39:07.804 --> 39:10.216
Yeah, relative to this talk
you just concluded.

39:10.390 --> 39:11.676
And?

39:11.850 --> 39:17.562
And I guess you'd say
a wonderment with us is

39:17.731 --> 39:21.019
if we mistook the tone
of one talk or the other,

39:21.193 --> 39:23.855
and if so... which?

39:25.155 --> 39:27.897
I dispute that
one fucking thing changed

39:28.075 --> 39:31.989
between those two talks
as to my attitude and resolve.

39:33.038 --> 39:38.158
Did the facts
of the camp situation change?

39:41.088 --> 39:43.250
Not to my certain knowledge.

39:45.008 --> 39:48.717
But if you're asking in the interim
have I been privy

39:48.887 --> 39:52.721
to a rumor far as claims
being invalidated,

39:52.891 --> 39:54.632
all titles thrown out,

39:54.810 --> 39:57.268
the answer is yes.

39:58.981 --> 40:01.018
Well, that would account for it.

40:01.191 --> 40:04.354
But the only goddamn fact
that I'm aware of is

40:04.528 --> 40:08.442
I never knew any man ate
a rumor or clothed himself with one

40:08.615 --> 40:10.606
or secured himself a piece of pussy.

40:10.784 --> 40:12.570
Well, rumors are not facts.

40:12.744 --> 40:16.954
So if any gutless cocksucker
tumbles to what is going on

40:17.124 --> 40:19.115
and decides he wants to cut and run,

40:19.293 --> 40:22.206
sell his fucking holdings,

40:22.379 --> 40:24.586
you tell him to come see me.

40:24.756 --> 40:28.624
Just say Cy Tolliver will buy
whatever he's fucking selling

40:28.802 --> 40:30.964
if he has that little faith in the camp,

40:31.138 --> 40:33.220
or rumors of judicial invalidation,

40:33.390 --> 40:35.973
or the panic that will ensue from that.

40:39.688 --> 40:42.430
<i>Go ahead, boys.
Go on outside and do your "yobs.</i>

40:42.608 --> 40:45.942
That's all we can fucking do right now.

40:46.111 --> 40:49.024
And not waver.

41:03.337 --> 41:05.704
( Belches )
Ah.

41:05.881 --> 41:08.623
Now that's fucking progress.

41:08.800 --> 41:13.169
Cocksucker upstairs,
across the way,

41:13.347 --> 41:14.929
whorehouse where I work--

41:15.098 --> 41:16.805
He is a fucking cocksucker.

41:16.975 --> 41:20.138
--Locks the fucking door
so people can't get to help him.

41:20.312 --> 41:22.929
( Yelling )
Fucking ashamed to be sick!

41:23.106 --> 41:25.359
You know he had a design
to murder that little one.

41:25.525 --> 41:27.607
No, I didn't.

41:27.778 --> 41:29.610
Hell, yes, he had a design.

41:29.780 --> 41:32.442
Charlie and me spirited her from camp,

41:32.616 --> 41:36.735
forced him to a second victim more
suitable to his cocksucker's purpose.

41:38.372 --> 41:41.990
Think they're any different if they've
had their fucking dicks cut on?

41:42.167 --> 41:44.408
They ain't no fucking different.

41:44.586 --> 41:47.874
You got to like their friends
or they won't teach you numbers

41:48.048 --> 41:51.040
or every other fucking
regulation they set!

41:54.012 --> 41:55.844
Anyways.

41:56.014 --> 41:57.721
Far as it fucking goes,

41:57.891 --> 42:01.384
he also brought the cripple
from that orphanage.

42:01.561 --> 42:03.177
Uh-- what orphanage?

42:03.355 --> 42:06.268
And don't buy his bullshit
about the 9¢ trick.

42:06.441 --> 42:09.559
- What cripple?
- Jewel,

42:09.736 --> 42:12.148
that he says he's got around

42:12.322 --> 42:13.938
against some hoople-head

42:14.116 --> 42:17.234
only having 9¢ and wanting
a piece of pussy.

42:17.411 --> 42:19.118
That ain't it.

42:19.287 --> 42:21.369
Why she's around is...

42:23.125 --> 42:26.243
it's his sick fucking way
of protecting her.

42:29.756 --> 42:31.667
I'm gonna get whiskey.

42:31.842 --> 42:34.209
There's entries on both side
of the fucking ledger

42:34.386 --> 42:36.127
is the fucking point,

42:36.304 --> 42:39.137
as I already talk like a fucking Jew!

42:43.103 --> 42:46.221
Shaping up to be a nice cool evening.

42:54.239 --> 42:59.450
Maybe he has a good side to him too
that I entirely fucking missed.

42:59.619 --> 43:01.656
It's always fucking possible,

43:01.830 --> 43:04.413
drunk as I am
fucking continuously.

43:08.795 --> 43:11.127
It's nice to see you.

43:23.643 --> 43:27.011
- You returned his timepiece.
- Yes.

43:28.023 --> 43:29.809
I thought I had told you.

43:29.983 --> 43:31.724
You did, Miss lsringhausen.

43:31.902 --> 43:33.939
I'm recurring to the topic,

43:34.112 --> 43:35.978
hoping you will be
more expansive.

43:36.156 --> 43:39.239
He accepted
the timepiece, ma'am,

43:39.409 --> 43:41.867
and raised another subject

43:42.037 --> 43:44.574
you and I ought pursue
at some different moment.

43:44.748 --> 43:48.833
Must I credit the right
of that "ought," Miss lsringhausen,

43:49.002 --> 43:52.540
or may I suspect
you enjoy setting terms?

43:52.714 --> 43:54.216
Terms, ma'am?

43:54.382 --> 43:58.842
Playing arbiter of the when
and why of things.

44:00.347 --> 44:04.011
Pursuing the second subject
Mr. Bullock raised, Mrs. Garret,

44:04.184 --> 44:08.769
might upset a person now present
junior to you and me.

44:10.690 --> 44:13.398
I cannot imagine how such a pursuit

44:13.568 --> 44:15.855
could be any more upsetting
than the atmosphere

44:16.029 --> 44:19.317
of relentless disapproval
that you so consistently generate.

44:21.868 --> 44:25.281
I've no further need of your services,
Miss lsringhausen.

44:26.540 --> 44:28.531
I'll say goodnight then
to you and Sofia.

44:28.708 --> 44:30.870
My preference is
your saying goodbye.

44:34.464 --> 44:36.922
I wonder, ma'am,

44:37.092 --> 44:39.504
if having made
so many decisions so quickly,

44:39.678 --> 44:41.589
your patience may be short just now.

44:41.763 --> 44:45.472
And I'd appeal to you to reconsider
your preferences in the morning.

44:45.642 --> 44:47.849
In any case, you'll want
to retire to your room.

44:48.019 --> 44:50.886
I hope you'll recall that
I've traveled from Chicago

44:51.064 --> 44:53.806
to enter your employ
and have no emergent prospects.

44:53.984 --> 44:56.817
We'll come to some arrangement.

44:56.987 --> 44:58.694
All right.

44:58.864 --> 45:01.071
I'll say goodnight then.

45:01.241 --> 45:03.073
Alma: As is your custom--

45:03.243 --> 45:07.077
without having spared
one affectionate look for my child.

45:08.081 --> 45:10.072
My training, ma'am,

45:10.250 --> 45:13.413
is that being engaged to see
to the child's education,

45:13.587 --> 45:16.079
my soliciting her affections

45:16.256 --> 45:18.588
would intrude
on the mother's province.

45:20.343 --> 45:24.462
And I would call that
a logical distinction,

45:24.639 --> 45:28.257
Miss lsringhausen, having nothing
to do with the way people live.

45:38.445 --> 45:40.732
( Door shuts)

45:40.906 --> 45:43.147
The people downstairs are scared.

45:43.325 --> 45:44.986
Are they?

45:45.160 --> 45:46.742
Off your talk.

45:46.912 --> 45:49.529
They think you believe
the camp's in jeopardy.

45:49.706 --> 45:53.449
I ain't answerable
for misinterpretations.

45:55.962 --> 45:57.464
The truth is, Lila,

45:57.631 --> 46:00.214
the weather is getting better

46:00.383 --> 46:03.967
and it looks to stay mild a spell.

46:04.137 --> 46:06.469
(laughing)

46:06.640 --> 46:10.679
Old Cy has outlasted
the cocksuckers one more time.

46:12.020 --> 46:13.852
If it was in me to kid myself,

46:14.022 --> 46:17.606
I'd take this
for proving God loves me.

46:17.776 --> 46:20.393
-( laughing )
- I believe He loves us.

46:20.570 --> 46:22.231
Do you, sweetheart?

46:22.405 --> 46:25.488
Did His hand lead me
buying and turning you out?

46:25.659 --> 46:27.775
That's a lovely thought.

46:27.953 --> 46:30.741
Next you're in touch,
would you put the good word in?

46:30.914 --> 46:32.905
I do.

46:33.083 --> 46:35.450
I pray for you every night.

46:40.048 --> 46:42.289
All right, stupid,

46:42.467 --> 46:44.708
time to shut your fucking mouth.

46:47.847 --> 46:49.679
Shut your fucking mouth now

46:49.849 --> 46:51.840
and turn over and close your eyes.

47:04.155 --> 47:05.862
Lift your leg.

47:09.494 --> 47:13.032
Languid and open for adventure.

47:17.210 --> 47:21.329
In your case, Atlantis,
present the tits a little more.

47:21.506 --> 47:23.873
Can you hold that
for half an hour?

47:24.050 --> 47:26.212
I've been holding this
my whole fucking life.

47:30.932 --> 47:33.640
- Mr. W.
- Hello.

47:33.810 --> 47:36.643
You jumped the gun
on our opening by half an hour,

47:36.813 --> 47:39.555
but I believe we can
make an exception.

47:40.650 --> 47:42.482
My partner Joanie.

47:42.652 --> 47:44.643
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

47:44.821 --> 47:48.485
Our caller fancies
Basil's Bourbon, Joanie,

47:48.658 --> 47:50.899
which is hid beneath
the floorboard at the bar.

47:51.077 --> 47:53.239
All right.

47:53.413 --> 47:54.995
Won't you sit?

47:55.165 --> 47:57.827
I don't know that I will.

47:58.001 --> 48:00.038
- Where is she?
- Carrie's been detained.

48:00.211 --> 48:01.542
Detained?

48:01.713 --> 48:04.705
You don't need me telling you
Carrie's mind's her own.

48:04.883 --> 48:07.591
We hit Cheyenne and she
stopped to see a relative.

48:09.262 --> 48:12.095
Basil Hayden hid beneath
the floorboards as advertised.

48:12.265 --> 48:15.428
Would you get out
of my sight, please?

48:17.270 --> 48:20.058
How close a relative is
she fucking in Cheyenne?

48:20.231 --> 48:23.599
- She's coming soon, Mr. W.
- Is her arrival imminent?

48:23.777 --> 48:26.735
- A matter of days.
- How many days are in a matter?

48:26.905 --> 48:29.192
Would fucking something else
fill the time?

48:29.365 --> 48:31.072
Yeah, how much you cost?

48:31.242 --> 48:35.031
I ain't for sale, sir.
But I would fuck you for free.

48:35.205 --> 48:38.197
- I have to say you ain't my type.
- Do you stand there, Mr. W,

48:38.374 --> 48:42.333
saying you're dead solid sure
you'll not ever again be surprised

48:42.504 --> 48:45.212
till you've completed
your earthly course?

48:45.381 --> 48:46.963
Ain't that presumptuous, sir?

48:47.133 --> 48:50.467
And ain't our quoted fee,
to surprise you, fair and just?

48:50.637 --> 48:52.674
I always pay f0? PUSSY-

48:52.847 --> 48:56.215
Well, I may let you then,
if you go ahead and twist my arm.

48:56.392 --> 48:58.884
You pay extra for that?

48:59.062 --> 49:00.973
Do unhand me.

49:01.147 --> 49:05.141
I, Mr. Wwho I just unhanded

49:05.318 --> 49:09.027
and Mr. Basil Hayden
do not wish to be disturbed.

49:14.452 --> 49:17.114
You want me back where I was?

49:17.288 --> 49:19.120
She kills that fucking cocksucker,

49:19.290 --> 49:21.998
I'm gonna be working
for the rest of my life.

49:23.920 --> 49:26.412
Richardson, Richardson,
Richardson.

49:26.589 --> 49:30.002
When will come the quiet hours
of our declining years?

49:32.554 --> 49:34.465
I'm talking to you, dimwit.

49:34.639 --> 49:36.676
I wasn't listening.

49:39.352 --> 49:42.344
Richardson,
won't you sit yourself?

49:42.522 --> 49:45.560
Allow me to take up your labors.

49:46.568 --> 49:50.152
I am confiding that turbulence,

49:50.321 --> 49:53.188
upheaval of the most violent sort,

49:53.366 --> 49:56.199
churning seas,
waves of a scale and force

49:56.369 --> 50:01.535
to make the most seasoned
seafarer vomit-- bleah--

50:01.708 --> 50:03.870
are in prospect for this camp.

50:04.043 --> 50:06.455
And, we, Richardson-- you, I

50:06.629 --> 50:08.711
and tragically others--

50:10.717 --> 50:13.379
so very many others

50:13.553 --> 50:16.636
who journeyed to the Hills
to stake their claims,

50:16.806 --> 50:20.595
and with those claims
their hopes for the future--

50:20.768 --> 50:25.308
are but pawns of the savage sea

50:25.481 --> 50:27.643
and playthings of the fucking deep.

50:31.237 --> 50:34.070
Not for us, apparently,

50:34.240 --> 50:40.657
the placid harbor,
on which voyages near complete

50:40.830 --> 50:43.743
to bob and rot, bob and rot,

50:43.917 --> 50:46.284
becalmed.

50:46.461 --> 50:49.829
For us, to the very end,

50:50.006 --> 50:52.873
the dizzying surges of the storm

50:53.051 --> 50:55.634
and its crashing descents!

50:55.803 --> 50:59.592
Do you understand me,
you repulsive lout?

50:59.766 --> 51:02.599
- No.
- The claims, Richardson.

51:02.769 --> 51:05.101
They're being overturned.

51:06.731 --> 51:10.440
Save those few
who dispose of their holdings

51:10.610 --> 51:12.601
before word circulates.

51:14.280 --> 51:16.863
Destitution looms!

51:17.033 --> 51:18.444
Oh dear.

51:18.618 --> 51:22.907
Yes yes. Even you
now recognize the situation.

51:24.123 --> 51:25.909
Ah well.

51:26.084 --> 51:28.792
Take the rest of the night off,
Richardson.

51:29.921 --> 51:32.288
Thank you, sir.

51:33.299 --> 51:35.381
But confide in no one!

51:36.719 --> 51:38.881
About the claims!

51:41.057 --> 51:43.469
Would we have even more fun naked?

51:43.643 --> 51:47.227
Or I could
and you could stay dressed.

51:47.397 --> 51:49.638
Or the opposite.

51:50.650 --> 51:52.186
Who am I?

51:52.360 --> 51:54.146
You're Mr. W.

51:54.320 --> 51:57.984
Your boss struck bigger than anyone
in the Comstock and Mexico.

51:58.157 --> 52:02.401
So you being here puts a shine
to this camp's prospects.

52:06.457 --> 52:08.164
Unbutton my shirt.

52:09.168 --> 52:11.205
Yes, sir.

52:18.678 --> 52:20.635
Do not look at my face.

52:20.805 --> 52:22.512
No, sirree.

52:25.184 --> 52:27.596
Shall I tell you who I work for?

52:27.770 --> 52:29.272
As you wish.

52:29.439 --> 52:33.774
If you do, how shall I occupy myself
while you're doing it?

52:33.943 --> 52:36.321
The same as if I don't.

52:36.487 --> 52:39.855
For me to judge?

52:41.868 --> 52:43.404
As you wish.

52:43.578 --> 52:46.946
Your shirt buttons are
your big interest?

52:47.123 --> 52:50.206
Or shall we advance
to these buttons here?

52:51.836 --> 52:56.751
And shall I hazard an approach
I rarely find ill-received?

53:00.636 --> 53:02.172
No.

53:04.140 --> 53:08.475
Shall I hazard an approach on myself
I never remember refusing?

53:08.644 --> 53:11.386
And will you supervise closely?

53:15.068 --> 53:18.277
Mr. W, I am gonna take that as a yes.

53:33.252 --> 53:36.836
No. Take it as a no.

53:39.050 --> 53:40.757
(Sighs)

53:40.927 --> 53:42.543
Nuts!

53:42.720 --> 53:44.802
( Chuckles )

53:44.972 --> 53:49.387
What a tiny corner of operation
for such an amusing mind.

53:49.560 --> 53:53.770
I'll promise as I sojourn here

53:53.940 --> 53:57.103
to bring you stories
of the world of men.

53:57.276 --> 54:02.021
I'll just be here in my girl's world
diddling myself.

54:03.491 --> 54:05.983
I admire you coming armed.

54:12.083 --> 54:14.040
- Hmm.
- ( Al panting )

54:14.210 --> 54:17.999
I'm gonna pass this through
your penis up into your bladder, Al,

54:18.172 --> 54:20.163
and I'm gonna say this to you once--

54:20.341 --> 54:23.299
I'm sorry for how it hurts.

54:26.097 --> 54:28.134
( Wheezing )

54:35.356 --> 54:37.643
Goddamn it, hold him still!

54:37.817 --> 54:39.649
( Screaming )
Mother of God!

54:45.575 --> 54:48.283
( Al screaming )
Help me! Mother of God!

54:48.453 --> 54:51.070
Fuck you, Johnny!
Get in there and fucking help him!

54:51.247 --> 54:53.329
What am I supposed to do?

54:53.499 --> 54:55.410
Trixie:
Put your hand in his mouth!

54:55.585 --> 54:58.122
Let him bite your fucking hand!

55:04.886 --> 55:07.969
All right, Al.
I'm in your bladder.

55:08.139 --> 55:09.846
I can hear the fucking stone.

55:10.016 --> 55:13.475
I'm gonna try now
to move the stone

55:13.644 --> 55:18.104
to release your water,
so you push now if you can, son.

55:18.274 --> 55:20.231
( Gags, straining )

55:20.401 --> 55:22.768
(yelling)
Oh God!

55:22.945 --> 55:25.198
- Mother, take me!
- Push now if you can.

55:25.364 --> 55:28.106
- Get your water flowing.
- I'm trying!

55:28.284 --> 55:30.070
Help me. Christ!

55:30.244 --> 55:33.202
(Al screaming )

55:37.418 --> 55:39.125
I'll fucking kill you, Doc!

55:39.295 --> 55:41.753
- You take it out of him!
- Doc: Shut up!

55:41.923 --> 55:44.210
(Al screaming )

55:55.645 --> 55:57.227
All right.

55:57.396 --> 56:01.014
I can see some fucking urine
with the blood.

56:01.192 --> 56:03.399
Good for you.

56:03.569 --> 56:06.607
Is he all right now?
Is he cured now?

56:06.781 --> 56:09.318
It's fucking something, anyway.

56:09.492 --> 56:11.529
Is that something
anyway, Doc?

56:11.702 --> 56:16.447
All right, Al, I'm gonna
take it out of you.

56:16.624 --> 56:19.116
You hold on
and it won't hurt so bad.

56:20.836 --> 56:22.543
(screaming )

56:29.929 --> 56:34.014
He put something out
of himself, Trixie.

56:34.183 --> 56:36.470
Now that's something anyway.

56:36.644 --> 56:38.430
Is it out of him?

56:38.604 --> 56:40.686
Well, that instrument is out of him.

56:40.856 --> 56:43.063
And what of the fucking stone?

56:43.234 --> 56:49.150
I didn't see
no fucking stone come out.
