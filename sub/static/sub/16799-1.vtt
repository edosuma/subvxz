WEBVTT

00:02.470 --> 00:06.463
Yes, honey, I got
the strawberry cream cheese.

00:06.500 --> 00:08.365
Two containers.

00:08.400 --> 00:11.403
When a pregnant lady talks,
I listen.

00:14.140 --> 00:15.402
Catch you soon.

00:20.580 --> 00:22.548
Emily, come on!

00:22.590 --> 00:24.182
Heads up!

00:24.220 --> 00:26.381
It's yours.

00:26.420 --> 00:28.217
Hey, guys.

00:28.260 --> 00:29.579
Missing something?

00:29.630 --> 00:32.224
That's not ours.

00:32.260 --> 00:34.296
Ours is back there.

00:40.270 --> 00:42.101
(people screaming)

00:47.840 --> 00:50.047
(siren wailing in distance)

00:56.290 --> 00:59.214
HOLMES: Mr. Gardner,
you wound me.

00:59.260 --> 01:00.784
I asked your secretary
to tell you I'm here.

01:00.820 --> 01:02.219
Next thing I know,
you're on the roof.

01:02.260 --> 01:05.525
It's hard not to
take that personally.

01:05.560 --> 01:07.323
What are you doing?

01:07.360 --> 01:09.191
Hey, what are
you doing?

01:09.230 --> 01:11.425
(grunts)

01:11.470 --> 01:14.792
Didn't want to keep this view
all to yourself, did you?

01:14.840 --> 01:16.467
You come any closer,
I'm gonna jump.

01:16.510 --> 01:19.104
Were it _not for the fact
that you might hurt someone

01:19.140 --> 01:21.472
down there, I would let you.

01:21.510 --> 01:24.707
I mean, you are a murderer
after all.

01:26.680 --> 01:28.477
When did you
figure out it was me?

01:28.520 --> 01:30.408
Days ago.

01:30.450 --> 01:32.657
You kept coming to see me.

01:32.690 --> 01:34.681
Insinuating things.

01:34.720 --> 01:37.382
Look, I just wanted you
to confess, not this.

01:38.560 --> 01:41.688
I didn't want to kill Yanis.

01:41.730 --> 01:43.368
I loved him.

01:43.400 --> 01:44.424
He introduced me to my wife,

01:44.470 --> 01:46.358
for crying out loud.
(phone chimes)

01:50.610 --> 01:51.804
What are you...?

01:51.840 --> 01:53.239
Shush.

01:54.340 --> 01:55.568
He's struck again.

01:55.610 --> 01:56.679
VVho?

01:56.710 --> 01:58.678
The Bensonhurst Bomber.

01:58.710 --> 02:00.211
Do you remember him?

02:00.250 --> 02:01.842
A serial bomber.

02:01.880 --> 02:03.518
An affinity for putting
improvised explosives

02:03.550 --> 02:05.313
in-in random places.

02:05.350 --> 02:08.319
His original reign of terror
was the bulk of 2010,

02:08.360 --> 02:09.349
and then he just disappeared.

02:09.390 --> 02:12.188
No one heard from him
for srx years.

02:12.230 --> 02:15.358
And then, several weeks ago, he
set off a device in a food court

02:15.400 --> 02:17.425
and maimed
a group of teenagers.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.859
He just...
just killed a man.

02:19.900 --> 02:22.539
We have to go.

02:22.570 --> 02:23.764
I'm not going anywhere.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.334
Not talking to you.

02:25.370 --> 02:26.337
Huh?

02:26.380 --> 02:29.133
(Taser crackling)

02:32.620 --> 02:34.212
Took you long enough.

02:34.250 --> 02:36.445
You couldn't get him
further away from the ledge?

02:36.490 --> 02:38.481
(exhales)

02:42.830 --> 02:46.288
(sirens wailing, urgent chatter)

02:46.330 --> 02:48.389
GREGSON: Looks like the bomb
was a homemade device.

02:48.430 --> 02:51.319
Composed mostly of bleach
and potassium chloride.

02:51.370 --> 02:53.292
Bensonhurst Bomber's
srgnature recrpe.

02:53.340 --> 02:54.967
Still smell
the chlorine.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.706
GREGSON: It was hidden inside
a soccer ball.

02:56.740 --> 02:58.332
The victim, Tom O'Leary,
picked it up

02:58.370 --> 02:59.473
and it exploded in his hands.

02:59.510 --> 03:01.307
BELL: _
Bomb squad estimates

03:01.340 --> 03:04.309
the force was about twice
the size of a hand grenade.

03:04.350 --> 03:07.649
O'Leary was killed, five others
were injured by flying debris.

03:07.680 --> 03:09.614
The detonator was
a walkie-talkie,

03:09.650 --> 03:11.447
which means the bomber was
probably watching from nearby.

03:11.490 --> 03:14.209
Not uncommon for people
with pathological urges

03:14.260 --> 03:17.684
for destruction to want to see
their work unfold.

03:17.730 --> 03:19.527
It's odd that the Bensonhurst
Bomber's comeback tour

03:19.560 --> 03:21.425
is two explosions
in Flushing.

03:21.460 --> 03:24.429
Yeah, the press is gonna have
to give him a new name.

03:24.470 --> 03:25.994
Oh. Those are
the mayor's people.

03:26.030 --> 03:27.736
We'll be back.

03:34.580 --> 03:36.548
What is it?

03:36.580 --> 03:38.571
Maybe nothing.

03:51.690 --> 03:53.726
Hey!

04:12.620 --> 04:14.372
(shouts) Hey!
Watch it.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.745
MAN:
Hey! Hey! Hey!

04:18.790 --> 04:20.655
(shouts in Swahili)

04:29.000 --> 04:30.797
(tires screech)

04:33.800 --> 04:35.791
What are you, nuts?!

04:35.840 --> 04:41.608
Captioning sponsored by
CBS

04:41.640 --> 04:43.642
*

04:48.980 --> 04:52.552
(speaking Swahili)

04:52.590 --> 04:55.354
Because it's a police matter,
and you have to stay. Here.

04:55.390 --> 04:56.755
(siren chirps)

04:56.790 --> 04:58.348
What the hell's going on?

04:58.390 --> 05:00.551
There was a man.
He was acting susprcrously.

05:00.600 --> 05:01.953
I followed, and he ran.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.592
Did he hit you?
No, no, no, no.

05:03.630 --> 05:05.598
A car hit me.
That's how he got away.

05:05.630 --> 05:07.029
This the car?
No.

05:07.070 --> 05:08.765
This was already here.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.802
You seriously think the man
you were chasing was the bomber?

05:10.840 --> 05:13.035
I think the_ fact that there was
a chase IS very susprcnous.

05:13.080 --> 05:16.038
This man will not let me
leave, eh? You are police.

05:16.080 --> 05:18.071
Fix it.
All right.

05:18.110 --> 05:19.873
If this isn't the
guy you chased

05:19.920 --> 05:21.569
and he's not the guy who
hit you with his car,

05:21.620 --> 05:22.814
then why the hell are
you keeping him here?

05:22.850 --> 05:24.408
Because the man I chased
put hIS hand on there,

05:24.450 --> 05:26.452
and if he's
the Bensonhurst Bomber,

05:26.490 --> 05:28.958
we're gonna have his prints.

05:35.830 --> 05:37.798
So you're a
sketch artist now?

05:37.830 --> 05:41.061
Sketch artists must rely
on the memories of others.

05:41.100 --> 05:42.863
I have the luxury of my own.

05:42.910 --> 05:45.435
Unfortunately, this drawing
only serves to advertise

05:45.470 --> 05:47.631
the identity-concealing
benefits

05:47.680 --> 05:50.899
of hoodies, hats,
and sunglasses.
Well, whoever he is,

05:50.950 --> 05:53.077
we have his prints. If he's
in the system, we'll get him.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.839
If he's in the system.
Who's the breeder?

05:56.890 --> 05:58.846
The "breeder" is Gia Caruso.

05:58.890 --> 06:01.085
She was one_
of my fIrst sober clients.

06:01.120 --> 06:04.521
She e-mailed me. She's getting
her ten-year chip next week.

06:04.560 --> 06:08.394
And she wanted me to see
her beautiful daughters.

06:22.950 --> 06:25.100
It occurs to me
you're approaching

06:25.150 --> 06:27.015
an anniversary of your own.

06:27.050 --> 06:28.779
Been almost five years
since you committed

06:28.820 --> 06:30.788
to becoming
a detective.

06:30.820 --> 06:32.788
Do I get a cake for that?

06:32.820 --> 06:34.788
Does it still
fulfill you?

06:34.820 --> 06:36.185
Cake?

06:36.220 --> 06:37.721
Our chosen profession.

06:37.760 --> 06:39.921
Why are you asking me this?

06:39.960 --> 06:41.928
You've been a detective
for exactly four years,

06:41.960 --> 06:43.598
nine months, 16 days.

06:43.630 --> 06:44.790
So?

06:44.830 --> 06:46.127
You were a sober companion
for four years,

06:46.170 --> 06:47.865
11 months, 23 days.

06:47.900 --> 06:50.607
I'm gonna ask you again, so?

06:50.640 --> 06:52.938
This is your third career.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.800
You stopped being a surgeon
for personal reasons.

06:54.840 --> 06:55.932
You stopped being
a sober companion

06:55.980 --> 06:57.572
because something better
came along.

06:57.610 --> 06:58.941
It just seemed a prudent time
to ask

06:58.980 --> 07:01.517
whether your wanderlust
had subsided.

07:02.790 --> 07:04.815
As a matter of fact,
you're right.

07:04.850 --> 07:06.852
Life is short.
I haven't been

07:06.890 --> 07:09.529
a construction worker yet,
or a biker,

07:09.560 --> 07:11.482
Indian chief.

07:11.530 --> 07:13.725
You think I don't get
the Village People reference,

07:13.760 --> 07:15.751
but I do.
(phone chimes)

07:17.570 --> 07:20.596
That guy you chased,
his prints are in the system.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.039
We got a positive I.D.

07:22.070 --> 07:24.459
His name's
Nathan Resor.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.502
I don't know what to tell you.

07:28.540 --> 07:30.144
I take taxis all over the city.

07:30.180 --> 07:31.909
I could've left
these fingerprints days ago.

07:31.950 --> 07:33.838
We're not interested
In days ago.

07:33.880 --> 07:35.677
We're interested
In this morning.

07:35.720 --> 07:38.883
The bomb in Flushing
exploded just after 8:15 am.

07:38.920 --> 07:40.956
I was at home, working.

07:40.990 --> 07:43.049
Didn't leave till after lunch.

07:43.090 --> 07:45.183
That's not
a very good alibi.

07:45.230 --> 07:48.620
I don't need a very good alibi.
I haven't done anything wrong.

07:48.660 --> 07:51.629
This map charts
the dates and locations

07:51.670 --> 07:53.865
of the Bensonhurst Bomber's
attacks,

07:53.900 --> 07:56.733
both the cluster from 2010--
here in red--

07:56.770 --> 07:59.068
and the two attacks from 2016--

07:59.110 --> 08:01.271
here in green. You've
provided an alibi,

08:01.310 --> 08:03.949
however anemic, for
the bombing today.

08:03.980 --> 08:06.244
We'd like to know
where you were

08:08.820 --> 08:10.947
M-Most_ of these are
from srx years ago.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.958
I have...
I have no idea where I was.

08:12.990 --> 08:15.788
Well, you understand
that might seem suspicious.

08:15.820 --> 08:19.654
(chuckles) I understand I can't
instantly recall memories

08:19.700 --> 08:21.793
from half a decade ago.

08:21.830 --> 08:25.163
Where were you on, uh,
Tuesday, April 2, 2010,

08:25.200 --> 08:27.259
uh, 10:40 in the morning?

08:27.300 --> 08:29.165
I was at the Whitechapel Gallery
in London

08:29.200 --> 08:31.168
_at an exhibition_ _
of neonmpressnonlst painting.

08:31.210 --> 08:33.269
Four minutes later,
I used the facilities.

08:33.310 --> 08:35.631
NATHAN:
Look, I'm a developer.

08:35.680 --> 08:39.047
90% of my job is running around
the city, going to build sites.

08:39.080 --> 08:41.014
Most of my days,
my schedule's shot to hell

08:41.050 --> 08:42.711
before I finish my coffee.

08:42.750 --> 08:45.639
Even if I found my calendar
from 2010,

08:45.690 --> 08:47.214
it wouldn't be accurate.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.683
In that case,
why don't we talk about a time

08:49.730 --> 08:51.186
when we do know where you were.

08:51.230 --> 08:52.993
September the 20th,

08:53.030 --> 08:56.056
2010. You were not yet in
the habit of using taxis.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.988
You were
drIVIng home

08:58.030 --> 09:01.739
from a bar when you struck
and killed a pedestrian.

09:01.770 --> 09:04.898
Your blood alcohol content
was measured at .13.

09:04.940 --> 09:07.670
You were arrested for vehicular
homICIde In the second degree

09:07.710 --> 09:08.972
and sentenced
to four years

09:09.010 --> 09:11.103
at the Great Meadow
Correctional Facility.

09:11.150 --> 09:14.938
On the plus side,
your prints landed in AFIS.

09:14.980 --> 09:16.811
When you were in prison,
there was not one single bombing

09:16.850 --> 09:18.989
in New York.
You got out July

09:19.020 --> 09:21.750
2015.
13 months later,

09:21.790 --> 09:23.826
the Bensonhurst Bomber_
starts blowmg thIngs up agaIn.

09:23.860 --> 09:25.953
You have to admit,
that's a little strange.

09:25.990 --> 09:27.958
No, I don't.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.763
Because I didn't do anything.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.324
I didn't blow
anything up.

09:31.370 --> 09:33.964
I didn't run
from any crIme scene.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.709
So, please, either charge me
with something

09:37.740 --> 09:40.732
or let me go home.

09:41.810 --> 09:43.846
This way.

09:46.850 --> 09:49.148
You're sure this is the_ same
guy from thIs mornIng?

09:49.180 --> 09:52.149
You doubt my identification?
Well, you did get
run over by a car.

09:52.190 --> 09:54.852
I went over the bonnet.
So I take it you're
gonna go back

09:54.890 --> 09:56.255
to his place
with Marcus?
You're not?

09:56.290 --> 09:57.985
There's someone
I need to talk to.

09:58.030 --> 09:59.952
Someone more interesting
than a mad bomber?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.956
(sighs) Someone who
might be able to give us

10:02.000 --> 10:03.262
a little more
information about him.

10:03.300 --> 10:05.029
Before he came in,
I dug into his files.

10:05.070 --> 10:07.061
Turns out, he and I may
know someone in common.

10:09.200 --> 10:10.861
(grunting)

10:12.840 --> 10:17.004
MAN:
Stick and move.
Stick and move!

10:17.050 --> 10:20.213
BOXER:
Felon.

10:20.250 --> 10:22.741
Hey, felon, don't act
like you don't hear me.

10:22.790 --> 10:24.985
Got a spit bucket here
with your name on it.

10:25.020 --> 10:28.319
(indistinct chatter, chuckling)

10:30.860 --> 10:33.226
You got some job, man.

10:33.260 --> 10:35.751
Cleaning up blood,

10:35.800 --> 10:38.223
other people's spit.
Unclogging the toilet.

10:38.270 --> 10:40.238
Hey, I bet there's
some days you wish

10:40.270 --> 10:42.830
you never got out of
prison. (chuckles)

10:42.870 --> 10:44.167
Hold up.

10:44.210 --> 10:46.201
(snorts)

10:48.040 --> 10:49.029
Gross.
That one for you.

10:49.080 --> 10:51.105
(laughs)

10:52.450 --> 10:54.315
Oh, come on, felon.

10:54.350 --> 10:56.011
What, you want to throw?

10:56.050 --> 10:58.189
Or is that a violation
of your parole?

10:58.220 --> 11:00.211
Oh!

11:00.260 --> 11:02.956
(man laughing)

11:07.000 --> 11:08.251
Ithoughtso.

11:08.300 --> 11:09.995
Got under his skin.

11:10.030 --> 11:12.089
You see that?

11:12.130 --> 11:13.028
Oh, you telling him

11:13.070 --> 11:14.799
not to drop the soap?

11:14.840 --> 11:16.068
'Cause the showers here,
they're not like that.

11:16.100 --> 11:18.136
(laughter)

11:20.740 --> 11:22.742
(men chattering)

11:28.180 --> 11:29.909
(men exclaiming, chattering)

11:37.030 --> 11:38.759
WATSON:
Shinwell?

11:41.160 --> 11:43.162
Do you remember me?

11:43.200 --> 11:45.725
How could I forget?

11:45.770 --> 11:49.069
It's good to see you, Doc.

11:49.100 --> 11:50.135
(chuckles)

11:50.170 --> 11:51.501
Actually, it's just Joan now.

11:51.540 --> 11:53.303
I gave up being a doctor
awhile ago.

11:53.340 --> 11:55.171
Yeah.

11:55.210 --> 11:56.973
I work with
the police now.

11:57.010 --> 12:00.047
I consult for them,
me and a partner.

12:00.080 --> 12:01.308
On medical stuff?

12:01.350 --> 12:03.989
On everything.

12:04.020 --> 12:05.044
It's sort of a long story.

12:05.090 --> 12:06.978
I bet.

12:07.020 --> 12:09.284
Listen, I wanted
to ask you about someone

12:09.320 --> 12:11.049
who was at_Great Meadow
the same tIme you were.

12:11.090 --> 12:13.251
Nathan Resor.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.052
I saw in his file that
the two of you worked together

12:15.100 --> 12:17.819
in the prison
cafeteria.

12:17.870 --> 12:19.792
I remember him.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.068
Were you close?

12:21.100 --> 12:22.169
Why?

12:22.200 --> 12:23.531
A bomb went off in a park

12:23.570 --> 12:24.798
in Flushing this morning.

12:24.840 --> 12:26.068
He's a person of interest.

12:26.110 --> 12:29.238
Wait, so you think
he the bomber?

12:29.280 --> 12:31.100
The one who been on the news?

12:31.150 --> 12:33.414
How well did you know
each other?

12:33.450 --> 12:35.077
Not well.

12:35.120 --> 12:36.269
So, you aren't friends,

12:36.320 --> 12:36.979
he never said anything

12:37.020 --> 12:38.942
about the Bensonhurst Bomber?

12:38.990 --> 12:40.309
Not to me.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.952
Okay.

12:44.160 --> 12:47.095
So, you've been out
for the past few weeks, right?

12:47.130 --> 12:49.223
How's it going?

12:49.260 --> 12:52.263
Well, I live in a halfway house.

12:52.300 --> 12:57.328
I empty buckets of spit
for a living...

12:58.610 --> 13:00.430
...but I could be dead.

13:00.480 --> 13:04.200
You know that better
than anybody.

13:09.550 --> 13:11.814
You think of anything.

13:18.430 --> 13:21.251
It's good to see you.

13:32.270 --> 13:34.602
(indistinct conversation)

13:34.640 --> 13:37.438
(keys beeping)

13:39.410 --> 13:40.616
Yeah, it's me.

13:40.650 --> 13:42.345
I know you said never
to call you,

13:42.380 --> 13:44.280
but the police came by
to see me.

13:46.320 --> 13:49.414
They want to know
about the Bensonhurst Bomber.

13:51.360 --> 13:53.248
We need to talk.

13:59.900 --> 14:02.039
MAN:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what
do you think you're doing?

14:02.070 --> 14:03.002
Mr. Resor.

14:03.040 --> 14:05.338
The Bensonhurst Bomber

14:05.370 --> 14:07.975
uses a homemade explosive
compound derived from bleach.

14:08.010 --> 14:09.034
I used that

14:09.080 --> 14:10.900
to clean my kitchen last night.

14:10.950 --> 14:13.145
You and your cop buddies left
footprints all over my floors

14:13.180 --> 14:14.169
when you searched my house.

14:14.220 --> 14:15.869
These were empty yesterday.

14:15.920 --> 14:16.944
Now they're not.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.981
I can't throw out garbage now?

14:19.020 --> 14:20.885
No, on the contrary,
I-I encourage it.

14:20.920 --> 14:22.888
You'd be amazed what
turns up in the rubbish.

14:22.930 --> 14:25.182
I once found the testicles
of an illegally poached,

14:25.230 --> 14:29.348
Asian, black bear in the bins of
an English member of parliament.

14:29.400 --> 14:32.528
He believed them to possess
certain curative powers.

14:32.570 --> 14:34.333
Oh, if that's why you're back,
let me save you the trouble.

14:34.370 --> 14:36.133
There aren't any testicles
in my garbage,

14:36.170 --> 14:38.001
black bear or otherwise.

14:40.010 --> 14:43.002
I let you search my house.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.006
Gave you access to
my phone, my e-mail.

14:45.050 --> 14:46.369
You didn't find anything.
What more do you need?

14:46.410 --> 14:47.968
You want, you want to look
through my baby pictures?

14:48.020 --> 14:50.011
Last night I examined
your various dealings

14:50.050 --> 14:51.517
as a land developer.

14:51.550 --> 14:54.383
Most of your transactions
are above board,

14:54.420 --> 14:57.457
but_ I found an old insurance
claIm thch gave me pause.

14:57.490 --> 14:59.549
In 2008,

14:59.590 --> 15:02.388
a half-constructed condominium
complex thch you owned

15:02.430 --> 15:03.988
burned to the ground.

15:04.030 --> 15:06.590
I lost ten months worth of work
because of that.

15:06.630 --> 15:09.190
And you earned $2.2 million
in insurance payouts.

15:09.240 --> 15:10.935
The fire was an accident.

15:10.970 --> 15:14.076
It was a very lucrative,
very convenient accident.

15:14.110 --> 15:15.270
All right, say you're right.

15:15.310 --> 15:17.073
I burned a building down.

15:17.110 --> 15:18.941
What the hell would that have
to do with setting off bombs?

15:18.980 --> 15:20.948
Perhaps you liked the way
it felt.

15:20.980 --> 15:23.210
Perhaps it wet your appetite
for destruction.

15:23.250 --> 15:24.945
You're nuts.

15:24.990 --> 15:27.208
I didn't start that fire
and I didn't build any bombs.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.955
I don't know how to do
either one of those things.

15:28.990 --> 15:32.289
A problem overcome with
tragic ease via the Internet.

15:32.330 --> 15:34.491
Fine. You want to keep wasting
your time with me,

15:34.530 --> 15:36.088
go right head.
We will.

15:36.130 --> 15:38.496
My partner's currently
with your ex-wife.

15:38.530 --> 15:40.339
I understand the separation
was quite recent.

15:40.370 --> 15:41.997
I wonder if she'll
be as confident

15:42.040 --> 15:45.134
of your innocence as you are.

15:47.140 --> 15:48.072
Nathan and I

15:48.110 --> 15:49.429
were married for nine years

15:49.480 --> 15:51.641
before we separated.

15:51.680 --> 15:52.977
When was that?

15:53.020 --> 15:54.317
Uh, January.
Just a few months

15:54.350 --> 15:56.511
after he got
out of prison.

15:56.550 --> 15:57.983
Before Nathan
was arrested

15:58.020 --> 16:00.284
he was this
funny, sweet guy,

16:00.320 --> 16:03.118
but after he went to
Great Meadow he was different.

16:03.160 --> 16:05.128
Different how?

16:05.160 --> 16:06.184
Oh, I don't know.

16:06.230 --> 16:09.222
He just wasn't...
himself anymore.

16:09.260 --> 16:11.421
We tried to talk about it.
We tried to make things work.

16:11.470 --> 16:14.064
We even went to a marriage
counselor a couple of times,

16:14.100 --> 16:16.034
but that's life, I guess.

16:16.070 --> 16:18.436
Can we assume that
you're famIIIar

16:18.470 --> 16:20.233
with the Bensonhurst Bomber?

16:20.280 --> 16:23.044
Of course. Why?

16:23.080 --> 16:25.378
Well, there have been some
new developments in the case.

16:25.410 --> 16:28.072
Right now,
Nathan is our best suspect.

16:29.150 --> 16:31.141
You're joking.

16:31.190 --> 16:32.145
You said he's different now.

16:32.190 --> 16:36.149
He's different,
but not blow-stuff-up different.

16:36.190 --> 16:38.750
Do you have any idea where he
was yesterday morning at 8:15?

16:38.790 --> 16:40.223
Of course not.
We're separated.

16:40.260 --> 16:42.194
I know this is
a lot to take in,

16:42.230 --> 16:45.427
but we would not be asking
if we didn't have good reason.

16:46.430 --> 16:48.068
Well, the only thing I know

16:48.100 --> 16:49.032
about his schedule lately

16:49.070 --> 16:51.436
is that he is crazy busy

16:51.470 --> 16:53.438
with some big development deal.

16:53.480 --> 16:54.777
There's a company
that wants to build

16:54.810 --> 16:56.038
one of those_ _
entertaInment paVIIIons

16:56.080 --> 16:57.240
in Canarsie.

16:57.280 --> 16:58.577
Mall, movie theater,

16:58.610 --> 17:00.043
indoor amusement park,
that kind of thing.

17:00.080 --> 17:01.616
It's supposed
to be huge.

17:01.650 --> 17:03.288
Nathan thinks
that he's got

17:03.320 --> 17:05.311
the right land for it,
so he's been working

17:05.350 --> 17:08.319
around the clock trying
to win the contract.

17:08.360 --> 17:11.056
Wouldn't be the first bad guy
with a day job.

17:11.090 --> 17:12.022
No, you don't
understand.

17:12.060 --> 17:13.698
This project is all
that he thinks about.

17:13.730 --> 17:15.220
He's impossible
to get on the phone.

17:15.260 --> 17:17.160
He doesn't respond to e-mails.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.519
Twice in the past month,
he's missed meetings

17:18.570 --> 17:20.197
with our divorce attorney
because of it.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.798
Even if he wanted

17:21.840 --> 17:24.559
to be the Bensonhurst Bomber,
he doesn't have the time.

17:24.610 --> 17:26.100
He's not your guy.

17:28.210 --> 17:30.349
(knocking)

17:35.250 --> 17:37.218
I'm looking for Joan.

17:37.250 --> 17:38.717
She, uh... she gave me this.

17:38.750 --> 17:40.752
Mr. Johnson I presume?

17:40.790 --> 17:43.224
Call me Shinwell.

17:43.260 --> 17:46.081
She's out at the moment, but
I'm expecting her back shortly.

17:46.130 --> 17:48.223
Please come in.

17:53.140 --> 17:54.698
(sniffs)

17:54.740 --> 17:56.435
So you're a former drug dealer,
correct?

17:58.570 --> 18:01.209
Former drug user.
(chuckles)

18:03.410 --> 18:06.607
So you met Watson after
you were shot by rivals

18:06.650 --> 18:08.242
in 2006?

18:08.280 --> 18:10.419
She pulled five
bullets out of you?

18:10.450 --> 18:12.441
That's right.

18:12.490 --> 18:14.185
I've been shot five times.

18:14.220 --> 18:16.279
Although on separate occasions.

18:16.320 --> 18:18.481
That's... great.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.290
What kind of name
is Shinwell?

18:25.330 --> 18:27.298
What kind of name is Sherlock?

18:27.340 --> 18:28.489
(door opens, closes)

18:30.340 --> 18:32.308
Shinwell.

18:32.340 --> 18:35.275
Hey. I, uh, wanted to talk

18:35.310 --> 18:37.801
to you about Nate Resor.

18:37.850 --> 18:40.375
Last night, after you left,
I reached out to a guy I know.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.342
Another graduate
of Great Meadow.

18:42.380 --> 18:44.280
He's out now,
just like me, but

18:44.320 --> 18:45.617
when we were still inside,

18:45.650 --> 18:47.652
he was assigned
to Nate's cell block.

18:47.690 --> 18:49.681
He wasn't too happy I called.

18:49.720 --> 18:52.280
Us talking is a violation
of our parole,

18:52.330 --> 18:55.720
but... I figured
it was important.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.466
And?

18:57.500 --> 19:01.732
And... he said talk
to Cray Fielder.

19:01.770 --> 19:04.238
He served served five and half
years at the Meadow

19:04.270 --> 19:05.737
for hurting a guy
in a bar fight.

19:05.770 --> 19:07.306
Cray and Nate
were tight.

19:07.340 --> 19:09.228
You hardly ever saw
one without the other.

19:09.280 --> 19:10.474
According to your friend?

19:10.510 --> 19:12.375
According to my friend.

19:12.410 --> 19:15.379
Now, those kind of guys--
they tell each other stuff.

19:15.420 --> 19:19.584
You want to know more about
Nate, you talk to Cray.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.228
I'll call Marcus.

19:23.260 --> 19:24.750
Thanks for this.

19:26.290 --> 19:28.599
Uh, as far as me reaching out
to my friend...

19:28.630 --> 19:30.769
Yeah. We don't need
to tell our captain.

19:36.640 --> 19:38.232
Um, I know you're
busy right now,

19:38.270 --> 19:40.738
but one of these days
when you get the time,

19:40.780 --> 19:42.577
I'd like to
pick your brain.

19:42.610 --> 19:44.441
Sure.

19:44.480 --> 19:46.402
About anything in particular?

19:46.450 --> 19:48.839
How you did it.

19:48.880 --> 19:50.848
How you changed,

19:50.890 --> 19:53.609
going from being
a doctor to this.

19:53.660 --> 19:56.584
I mean, it-it must
have been hard, right?

19:56.620 --> 19:58.429
Yeah, actually, it was.

19:58.460 --> 20:00.519
Look at you now.

20:00.560 --> 20:03.358
You seem good,

20:03.400 --> 20:05.425
happy.

20:05.470 --> 20:08.337
I'm trying to change, too.

20:15.640 --> 20:17.278
(door opens)

20:17.310 --> 20:18.800
FIELDER:
You want to know about Nate?

20:18.850 --> 20:21.876
Did he, uh, do something wrong?

20:21.920 --> 20:23.649
Well, you two overlapped

20:23.690 --> 20:25.317
at the Great Meadow
Correctional Facility.

20:25.350 --> 20:26.840
You were convicted
of assault one

20:26.890 --> 20:29.450
around the same time he went
away for negIIgent homICIde.

20:29.490 --> 20:31.458
Uh-huh. So?

20:31.490 --> 20:34.323
The two of you put the "mates"
in "inmates," did you not?

20:34.360 --> 20:36.499
We were buddies, if that's what
you're asking, yeah.

20:36.530 --> 20:38.498
WATSON:
You're still buddies, right?

20:38.530 --> 20:39.792
He gave you a job

20:39.830 --> 20:41.491
at his development firm
when you got out.

20:41.540 --> 20:44.429
Mm-hmm.

20:44.470 --> 20:47.405
Are you gonna tell me
what you think he did or what?

20:47.440 --> 20:49.271
We believe
he's in the habit of hiding

20:49.310 --> 20:51.847
and then detonating explosive
devices in public places.

20:51.880 --> 20:53.643
He's been stalking
Flushing of late.

20:53.680 --> 20:55.341
About six years ago,

20:55.380 --> 20:57.848
he was exclusive
to Bensonhurst.

20:59.320 --> 21:00.651
Wait a second.

21:00.690 --> 21:03.420
You think Nate is the
Bensonhurst Bomber?

21:03.460 --> 21:06.623
Given the fact that he fled the
scene of an explosion yesterday,

21:06.660 --> 21:08.628
he's at the top of our list.

21:08.660 --> 21:11.322
BELL:
Guys talk in prison,
Cray, you know this.

21:11.370 --> 21:13.793
They share stories, secrets.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.728
Sometimes it's 'cause
they want a tougher rep,

21:15.770 --> 21:17.362
sometimes they're
just bored.

21:18.810 --> 21:20.573
That's right, they do.

21:20.610 --> 21:22.532
What about Nathan?

21:23.780 --> 21:25.668
No. Uh...

21:25.710 --> 21:27.769
I've got nothing to say.

21:27.820 --> 21:31.745
That's not_ the same
as not knowmg anythIng.

21:31.790 --> 21:34.759
Okay...

21:34.790 --> 21:36.018
say you're right
about Nate.

21:36.060 --> 21:37.584
Say that when
we were locked up,

21:37.630 --> 21:40.349
he told me that he loved
blowing people up,

21:40.400 --> 21:42.527
couldn't get enough of it.

21:42.560 --> 21:44.619
You think that I wouldn't
have flipped on him in a second

21:44.670 --> 21:46.592
to get a deal
with the DA?

21:46.630 --> 21:48.769
You think I didn't want
to see my wife and kids

21:48.800 --> 21:50.438
as _soon as
I pOSSlbly could?

21:50.470 --> 21:52.461
Maybe he promised you
a job

21:52.510 --> 21:53.772
to pay for your silence.

21:53.810 --> 21:57.644
Nate gave me a job
because he is a good guy.

21:57.680 --> 22:01.844
You three, you are
pieces of garbage.

22:01.880 --> 22:04.678
You bully guys like me
because I'm an ex-con.

22:04.720 --> 22:06.688
You know it's easy to
violate me back to prison,

22:06.720 --> 22:09.689
so you try to get us to
tell lies about each other.

22:09.720 --> 22:12.723
It's easier than finding
the real bomber, right?

22:12.760 --> 22:14.899
(scoffs)
Forget it. I'm done.

22:16.530 --> 22:18.896
(door opens)

22:21.770 --> 22:24.739
(fuse sizzling)

22:24.770 --> 22:25.805
(loud bang)

22:25.840 --> 22:27.728
What the hell
was that?

22:27.780 --> 22:31.705
I thought Mr. Resor might like
a taste of his own medicine.

22:31.750 --> 22:34.571
I was gone for five minutes.
You built a bomb?

22:34.620 --> 22:36.372
I was puzzling
as to why a killer

22:36.420 --> 22:37.944
so utterly fixated
on Bensonhurst

22:37.990 --> 22:40.515
he's detonated t_wo
consecutIve_deVIces
In FlushIng.

22:40.560 --> 22:41.652
Couldn't come up
with an answer.

22:41.690 --> 22:43.453
I needed to let off
some steam.

22:43.490 --> 22:45.048
It's not steam,
it's smoke.

22:45.090 --> 22:47.081
You could have set off
one of the detectors.

22:48.600 --> 22:50.966
Helpful fellow,
Shinwell.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.490
Nice of him
to pop 'round.

22:52.530 --> 22:54.589
(sighs)
Yeah, it was.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.938
Yeah. I couldn't help
but notice

22:56.970 --> 22:58.631
a certain warmth between you.

22:59.970 --> 23:01.107
Warmth?

23:01.140 --> 23:04.143
Yeah, how you care
about him.

23:05.450 --> 23:08.419
If you ask me if I am sleeping
with him, I swear to God...

23:08.450 --> 23:09.576
No, I'm not. I mean, the man
used to make his living

23:09.620 --> 23:10.882
selling drugs.

23:10.920 --> 23:11.841
The night he was
attacked by gunmen,

23:11.890 --> 23:13.141
he fired back
into a crowd,

23:13.190 --> 23:14.418
hitting an innocent
bystander.

23:14.460 --> 23:15.449
He's not really your type.

23:15.490 --> 23:17.879
And, yet, uh, warmth.

23:19.090 --> 23:21.024
I'm proud of him, okay?

23:21.060 --> 23:23.426
You're proud of a man that
fired into a group of people?

23:23.470 --> 23:26.064
I mean, not him exactly.
The work I did.

23:26.100 --> 23:29.069
The surgery
you performed?

23:30.710 --> 23:33.873
The night he was shot, I dug
two .385 out of his arm,

23:33.910 --> 23:35.070
another two out
of his thigh.

23:35.110 --> 23:36.577
The fifth was in his chest,

23:36.610 --> 23:38.009
and his lungs were filling
with blood.

23:38.050 --> 23:39.870
I got a tube in,

23:39.910 --> 23:41.878
but the place was a circus,
so I almost missed

23:41.920 --> 23:44.616
the muffled heart tones, the
distended vein in his neck.

23:44.650 --> 23:47.585
His pericardium was
filling with blood, too.

23:47.620 --> 23:49.611
I mean, it happens
to maybe 2% of patients,

23:49.660 --> 23:53.596
but even a hole the size
of a pin prick can flood it.

23:53.630 --> 23:56.622
I remember inserting
the needle into his chest.

23:56.660 --> 23:58.924
You go too deep,
you risk puncturing

23:58.970 --> 24:01.461
the heart itself.

24:01.500 --> 24:03.866
But then I heard this pop
when I got to the membrane,

24:03.910 --> 24:07.129
and then I started
to draw the blood away.

24:07.170 --> 24:10.503
A few minutes later he was
stable enough for surgery.

24:11.980 --> 24:15.143
I found the .38 lodged
inside the wall of his bronchus.

24:15.180 --> 24:17.114
And that was that.

24:17.150 --> 24:19.186
I stitched him up,
and ten days later

24:19.220 --> 24:22.485
he was transferred
to a prIson ward for recovery.

24:22.520 --> 24:24.124
Usually when I think
back to those days,

24:24.160 --> 24:26.481
I don't feel great.

24:26.530 --> 24:29.954
But seeing Shinwell yesterday,
it made me feel good.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.991
You miss it.

24:32.030 --> 24:33.998
Being a surgeon,
you've been missing it.

24:34.040 --> 24:36.531
Why do you keep
doing that?
Doing what?

24:36.570 --> 24:38.561
Worrying that I'm thinking
about some other job.

24:38.610 --> 24:40.202
This is my job.
This is what I do.

24:40.240 --> 24:41.377
And yet, on more than
one occasion this summer,

24:41.410 --> 24:44.573
you've been distracted,
melancholy.
No, I haven't.

24:45.580 --> 24:47.172
I haven't.

24:47.210 --> 24:50.987
(phone ringing)

24:51.020 --> 24:52.214
Captain.

24:52.250 --> 24:54.184
GREGSON:
There's been another explosion.

24:54.220 --> 24:56.552
Pipe bomb in a book deposit box

24:56.590 --> 24:58.649
outside a library
here in Flushing.

24:58.690 --> 25:01.557
Two people killed in the blast,

25:01.600 --> 25:03.522
half dozen more injured.

25:03.570 --> 25:05.299
It's another
bleach-based compound

25:05.330 --> 25:07.696
and it's another
pubIIc detonatIon.

25:07.740 --> 25:09.628
Obviously, it's our guy.

25:09.670 --> 25:11.638
I thought we had Nathan Resor
under surveillance.

25:11.670 --> 25:13.069
We did.

25:13.110 --> 25:15.078
The book deposit
was emptied at 5:00 pm,

25:15.110 --> 25:18.079
which means that the_ bomb
was planted sometIme

25:18.110 --> 25:19.668
in the last three hours.

25:19.710 --> 25:22.247
We've had eyes on Resor
the whole time--

25:22.280 --> 25:25.113
he didn't come
anywhere near thIs place.

25:25.150 --> 25:27.687
I don't who
the Bensonhurst Bomber is,

25:27.720 --> 25:29.517
but it isn't him.

25:37.060 --> 25:40.188
(blender whirring)

25:40.230 --> 25:42.130
I heard your phone ring.

25:42.170 --> 25:44.229
I don't know how, but yeah.

25:45.840 --> 25:47.034
It was Marcus.

25:47.070 --> 25:49.106
His team finished
canvassmg the area

25:49.140 --> 25:50.641
around the latest explosion.

25:50.680 --> 25:51.772
And?

25:51.810 --> 25:53.573
Notone
goodlead.

25:53.620 --> 25:56.612
Even worse, the library's
exterior security cameras

25:56.650 --> 25:59.210
only cover the front
and rear entrances.

25:59.250 --> 26:01.081
There's no footage of
the sidewalk, which means

26:01.120 --> 26:02.781
there's no footage
of the book deposit box,

26:02.820 --> 26:04.959
which means there's no way
to identify the person

26:04.990 --> 26:06.981
who's been setting off
all the bombs.

26:07.030 --> 26:09.658
People. You said "person."
It's people.

26:09.700 --> 26:10.997
What do you mean?

26:11.030 --> 26:13.191
There isn't
one bomber, but two.

26:13.230 --> 26:15.790
A pair of literal incendiaries
working in tandem

26:15.840 --> 26:17.728
under the banner
of the Bensonhurst Bomber.

26:17.770 --> 26:19.658
How else could the device
in the library

26:19.710 --> 26:21.701
have been planted and detonated
while Nathan Resor

26:21.740 --> 26:24.345
was under surveillance?
He has a partner.

26:24.380 --> 26:26.302
Well, that's one possibility.
The other

26:26.350 --> 26:28.147
is that we're just
wrong about him.

26:28.180 --> 26:30.341
Someone needs a pick-me-up.

26:30.380 --> 26:31.916
Mm.

26:36.390 --> 26:37.687
Bananas?

26:37.730 --> 26:39.925
Sure.
I'm just saying

26:39.960 --> 26:41.325
there's not one shred
of usable evidence

26:41.360 --> 26:43.191
that connects him
to the bombings.

26:43.230 --> 26:45.266
Yes, he ran from the scene
of the second attack,

26:45.300 --> 26:47.689
but I can think of a dozen
reasons why an ex-con

26:47.740 --> 26:49.332
would run from someone
who works WIth the po|Ice.

26:49.370 --> 26:53.238
"Trust your instincts, though
you can render no reason."

26:55.980 --> 26:58.346
Nathan Resor isn't the bomber.

26:58.380 --> 27:00.200
He's a bomber.
The good news is

27:00.250 --> 27:02.241
I think
I've identified the other.

27:09.860 --> 27:12.681
(metal clicking)

27:16.830 --> 27:18.821
Two and a half minutes
to pIck a smgle lock?

27:18.870 --> 27:20.428
You're rusty.

27:20.470 --> 27:23.268
Actually, Mr. Fielder
employs a commercial grade

27:23.300 --> 27:25.860
double-cylinder
titanium deadbolt on his door.

27:25.910 --> 27:27.707
Two and a half minutes
Is a personal record.

27:27.740 --> 27:30.300
Some lock
for such a modest place.

27:30.340 --> 27:31.807
It would seem
to support

27:31.850 --> 27:34.717
my theory he's a man of secrets.

27:34.750 --> 27:37.218
Yesterday I thought
he was aware of evidence

27:37.250 --> 27:39.411
that might incriminate
Nathan Resor.

27:39.450 --> 27:42.283
Now I think
he's aware of evidence

27:42.320 --> 27:44.288
that might incriminate
the both of them.

27:44.330 --> 27:47.458
Because his prison sentence
fits the bomber's dormant period

27:47.490 --> 27:50.129
more perfectly
than Nathan's sentence.
GIve you one guess

27:50.160 --> 27:51.388
which neighborhood he lived in

27:51.430 --> 27:53.318
during the bomber's
original run.

27:53.370 --> 27:54.860
Bensonhurst.

27:54.900 --> 27:56.891
I found some
tax documents from 2010.

27:56.940 --> 27:59.067
His apartment
was a stone's throw

27:59.110 --> 28:01.237
from the site
of the original attack.

28:01.280 --> 28:04.704
Could have watched the explosion
from his bedroom window.

28:10.180 --> 28:12.740
Mm. Nice playroom.

28:12.790 --> 28:14.758
Yeah.

28:14.790 --> 28:17.759
That train set is too _
complex to have been bUIlt

28:17.790 --> 28:19.951
by Mr. Fielder's
children.

28:19.990 --> 28:23.790
So, yesterday you said
I seemed down in the dumps.

28:23.830 --> 28:24.922
Why?

28:24.970 --> 28:26.926
Well, nothing you said,
certainly.

28:26.970 --> 28:28.392
You and I have lived together

28:28.440 --> 28:29.361
over a span
of almost five years.

28:29.400 --> 28:33.268
I have a certain grasp
of your... rhythms.

28:33.310 --> 28:35.073
Plus,
on three occasions

28:35.110 --> 28:38.773
this summer, you wore a rather
chic ensemble into the field

28:38.810 --> 28:41.779
and then, several weeks later,
you wore it again.

28:41.820 --> 28:43.947
Now, that's not
like you, Watson.

28:43.990 --> 28:45.981
No, that's not like you at all.

28:46.020 --> 28:47.817
So, I'm not just

28:47.860 --> 28:49.782
depressed, I am superficial.

28:49.820 --> 28:52.459
I mention it only to be helpful.

28:52.490 --> 28:55.755
Well, I'm not thinking about
another career.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.859
But?

28:59.030 --> 29:00.520
I miss helping people.

29:00.570 --> 29:03.198
We help people all the time.

29:03.240 --> 29:05.435
I mean...

29:05.470 --> 29:07.438
helping people get better.

29:07.470 --> 29:09.870
I went to school for 11 years
to become a surgeon.

29:09.910 --> 29:12.777
I wanted to fix people,
take their pain away.

29:12.810 --> 29:14.448
And I was good at it.

29:14.480 --> 29:16.539
And then I killed someone.

29:16.580 --> 29:19.185
So, becoming a
sober companion

29:19.220 --> 29:22.348
I could still be involved,
you know?

29:22.390 --> 29:25.279
But now, you and me-- we're in
the punishment business.

29:25.330 --> 29:27.286
We find people who
do terrible things.

29:27.330 --> 29:31.061
And we stop them from doing
more terrible things.

29:31.100 --> 29:34.092
A few months ago
you went to

29:34.140 --> 29:36.267
a support group meeting,
and I don't know why.

29:36.300 --> 29:37.938
I just thought to myself,

29:37.970 --> 29:40.564
"I used to go to those with him.
That was my job."

29:40.610 --> 29:42.874
And then

29:42.910 --> 29:46.801
I started to think about
how far you've come.

29:46.850 --> 29:49.375
It occurred to you
I no longer need your help,

29:49.420 --> 29:51.809
and you were disappointed.

29:52.950 --> 29:54.952
Isn't that sick?

30:01.630 --> 30:02.551
You see something?

30:02.600 --> 30:05.569
It's not what I see...

30:05.600 --> 30:06.828
What is it?

30:09.540 --> 30:10.393
Bleach.

30:12.270 --> 30:14.830
Bensonhurst Bomber's
favorIte IngredIent.

30:14.880 --> 30:18.099
His devices also require
more standard components.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.572
Packing paper, for example.

30:19.610 --> 30:22.147
Fuses, trigger switches.

30:24.220 --> 30:25.915
This is cover

30:25.950 --> 30:28.350
for Cray Fielder's
bomb-making equipment.

30:28.390 --> 30:30.585
GREGSON:
We found your little train set,

30:30.620 --> 30:33.623
Mr. Fielder.
The lab tested

30:33.660 --> 30:36.128
your materials and they're
a perfect match

30:36.160 --> 30:38.594
for samples found
at the sites of the attacks

30:38.630 --> 30:42.430
by the Bensonhurst Bomber
in 2010 and today.

30:42.470 --> 30:44.938
_ BELL: _
You're g0Ing back to prIson.

30:44.970 --> 30:47.632
And this time
you won't be comIng out.

30:47.670 --> 30:50.002
WATSON:
Your family's downstairs.

30:50.040 --> 30:51.644
They're upset. They don't
understand what's going on.

30:51.680 --> 30:54.342
They want to talk to you.
We can make that happen.

30:54.380 --> 30:55.870
All you have to do is tell us

30:55.920 --> 30:56.614
about the person
who's been helping you.

30:56.650 --> 31:00.381
What do you mean, helping me?

31:00.420 --> 31:02.354
We know that the most recent
trio of attacks

31:02.390 --> 31:04.881
was engineered
by not one man but two.

31:04.930 --> 31:06.921
The bomb-making equipment
found at your house confirms

31:06.960 --> 31:08.655
that you are one half
of the team.

31:08.700 --> 31:11.965
All signs point to Nathan Resor
as the other.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.888
HOLMES:
Which isn't to say
that the Bensonhurst Bomber's

31:13.940 --> 31:15.931
exploits were always
a joint effort.

31:15.970 --> 31:18.109
When you first appeared
on the scene six years ago,

31:18.140 --> 31:20.665
the evidence suggests
it was the work of a single man.

31:20.710 --> 31:22.678
_ It was _
a uanuely destructIve force.

31:22.710 --> 31:26.009
Other serial bombers-- like
Ted Kaczynski, George Metesky--

31:26.050 --> 31:27.938
they were motivated
by a misguided grudge

31:27.980 --> 31:30.278
against society,
but the Bensonhurst Bomber

31:30.320 --> 31:33.141
was driven by something darker.
He's not seeking revenge,

31:33.190 --> 31:36.557
he just has a passion
for making things go bang.

31:36.590 --> 31:39.150
But the thing about passion
is it can be taught,

31:39.190 --> 31:40.953
it can be learned.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.695
WATSON:
But the first round
of the bomber's attacks

31:42.730 --> 31:45.927
stopped after the two of you
went to prison.

31:45.970 --> 31:48.336
The second round began
just a few months

31:48.370 --> 31:50.964
after the two of you
were released.
Which means

31:51.010 --> 31:54.002
either one of you could have
been the original bomber.

31:54.040 --> 31:56.406
We know you and Nathan
were close in prison.

31:56.440 --> 31:58.499
You shared food, contraband.

31:58.550 --> 32:01.348
Wouldn't be hard to imagine
you sharing other things, too.

32:01.380 --> 32:03.712
Secrets about building
bombs, for example.

32:03.750 --> 32:05.684
WATSON:
Now, one of you was the bomber

32:05.720 --> 32:09.019
before you went to prison.
That man recruited the other,

32:09.060 --> 32:11.654
so the real question is did you

32:11.690 --> 32:13.681
enlist Nathan
or was it the other way around?

32:13.730 --> 32:16.198
Are you the teacher
or the student?

32:18.700 --> 32:21.260
The teacher.

32:21.300 --> 32:24.508
But you are wrong...

32:24.540 --> 32:25.700
about the student.

32:25.740 --> 32:28.208
You admit you have a partner?
I do.

32:28.240 --> 32:30.708
But it's not Nathan Resor.

32:34.020 --> 32:35.214
I'll bite. Who is it?

32:36.480 --> 32:38.983
I found someone...

32:39.020 --> 32:42.717
who can carry on my legacy
long after I'm gone.

32:42.760 --> 32:45.081
Someone who's just as committed
as I am.

32:45.130 --> 32:49.055
Someone who shares my passion
for, um--

32:49.100 --> 32:52.092
how did you put it--
making things go bang?

32:52.130 --> 32:54.530
BELL: Mr. Fielder, the D.A.'s
prepared to offer you

32:54.570 --> 32:58.461
special considerations if you
help us capture your partner.

32:58.510 --> 33:00.102
Why don't you
do yourself a favor?

33:00.140 --> 33:04.304
I am looking at life in prison
for what I've done,

33:04.350 --> 33:07.001
with or without
speCIal conSIderatIons.

33:07.050 --> 33:08.745
If I stay silent,
I can watch

33:08.780 --> 33:12.284
my partner rain hell
down on Flushing.

33:12.320 --> 33:13.548
HOLMES:
You mentioned Flushing.

33:13.590 --> 33:17.788
We were wondering what drew your
attention away from Bensonhurst.

33:17.820 --> 33:20.129
You're wrong about Nate.

33:20.160 --> 33:22.025
You have been
from the beginning.

33:22.060 --> 33:24.790
You're lying.
Rather clumsily, in fact.

33:24.830 --> 33:26.525
We know that he's your partner,
and we will prove it,

33:26.570 --> 33:28.060
with or without your help.

33:28.100 --> 33:31.308
You won't.

33:31.340 --> 33:32.762
Just like you won't find

33:32.810 --> 33:35.574
the 20 bombs
my real partner and I

33:35.610 --> 33:38.044
have already hidden in Flushing.

33:38.080 --> 33:40.344
_ Motion activated.
You jostle them, they go off.

33:40.380 --> 33:43.076
And some of them are very
colorful, the kind of thing

33:43.120 --> 33:46.044
a... a kid might like
to play with.

33:47.420 --> 33:49.058
You think this is over?

33:49.090 --> 33:50.057
Well, it's not.

33:53.090 --> 33:55.229
Flushing is never gonna be safe.

33:55.260 --> 33:56.796
Neven

34:04.670 --> 34:06.069
(door closes)

34:06.110 --> 34:07.407
WATSON:
Any word from the captain?

34:07.440 --> 34:08.600
In the wake of Cray Fielder's
threats

34:08.640 --> 34:11.370
this afternoon, the department's
Critical Response Command

34:11.410 --> 34:12.547
has been mobilized.

34:12.580 --> 34:14.411
They're currently
searching Flushing

34:14.450 --> 34:16.111
for IEDs, accompanied
by a squadron

34:16.150 --> 34:18.414
of bomb-sniffing dogs.
Beagles, apparently.

34:18.450 --> 34:20.509
WATSON:
They haven't found anything?

34:20.550 --> 34:22.450
No, not yet.
That is disgusting.

34:22.490 --> 34:25.357
A 2011 study concluded that
chewing gum for five minutes

34:25.390 --> 34:27.585
and then discharging it
produced a 15 minute window

34:27.630 --> 34:29.757
of improved cognitive function.

34:29.800 --> 34:31.722
I need all the focus I can get.

34:31.770 --> 34:34.159
You brought all this
from upstairs?

34:34.200 --> 34:36.430
Been combing through it
to see if we missed anything.

34:36.470 --> 34:38.404
Have we?
Nope.
That's the problem.

34:38.440 --> 34:39.759
What do you mean?
(bell dings)

34:39.810 --> 34:42.335
Mm.

34:44.810 --> 34:47.142
By all accounts,
and there are many,

34:47.180 --> 34:48.772
the actions of the
Bensonhurst Bomber have always

34:48.820 --> 34:50.776
followed a very
particular script.

34:50.820 --> 34:54.358
No warnings. Devices planted the
same day that they explode.

34:54.390 --> 34:57.257
Controlled detonations
from close prOXImIty.

34:57.290 --> 35:00.623
Fielder's threat this afternoon
completely Ignores that scrIpt.

35:00.660 --> 35:03.458
Bombs planted days or weeks
before they explode.

35:03.500 --> 35:05.559
Uncontrolled detonations.
Even the threat itself

35:05.600 --> 35:07.329
veers from canon.

35:07.370 --> 35:08.564
So he's either suddenly decided

35:08.600 --> 35:10.465
to radically alter
his entire M.O....

35:10.500 --> 35:11.467
Or he's lying.

35:11.510 --> 35:13.535
He's lying.

35:16.510 --> 35:19.240
*

35:20.710 --> 35:24.339
What if he just wants
more headlines?

35:24.390 --> 35:26.210
Imagine you're him.

35:26.250 --> 35:28.218
You're going to prison
for the rest of your life.

35:28.260 --> 35:29.511
You've been working
with a partner,

35:29.560 --> 35:31.687
but the police are onto him,
so he won't be

35:31.730 --> 35:33.584
planting any more bombs.
It's the end of the line.

35:33.630 --> 35:36.349
Fun's over.
So you make threats,

35:36.400 --> 35:38.664
in the hope that your shadow
would loom over the city,

35:38.700 --> 35:40.520
even though you're behind bars.

35:40.570 --> 35:41.867
Well, he and Nathan
Resor didn't really

35:41.900 --> 35:43.663
hide more bombs
around Flushing,

35:43.700 --> 35:45.600
he was just trying
to pad their legacy.

35:45.640 --> 35:47.608
(phone ringing)

35:47.640 --> 35:49.528
Marcus.

35:49.580 --> 35:52.504
Just got the latest surveillance
report on Nathan Resor.

35:52.550 --> 35:54.677
Look, if this guy's building
bombs, he's doing it

35:54.720 --> 35:56.312
in the back seats of taxis.

35:56.350 --> 35:57.874
He's been driving around
all day, locking down

35:57.920 --> 36:01.515
some big construction project
in Canarsie.

36:01.560 --> 36:03.710
Yeah, his ex-wife mentioned it.
It's supposed to be some sort of

36:03.760 --> 36:05.682
entertainment complex, right?

36:05.730 --> 36:07.550
Not "supposed to."

36:07.590 --> 36:09.592
Will be. He beat out
the competition today.

36:09.630 --> 36:12.519
How do I know? 'Cause
he bought a round of drinks

36:12.570 --> 36:14.458
for an entire bar in Chelsea.

36:14.500 --> 36:16.764
Things may be looking down
for the Bensonhurst Bomber,

36:16.800 --> 36:18.609
but they're looking up
for Nathan Resor.

36:18.640 --> 36:21.632
What do you mean,
he "beat out the competition"?

36:21.680 --> 36:23.534
Well, apparently,
he was bidding

36:23.580 --> 36:25.969
against some competing property
in Queens.

36:26.010 --> 36:28.547
The people pushing that site
bowed out a few hours ago.

36:28.580 --> 36:31.686
Nathan's been_in overdrive
ever SInce.

36:31.720 --> 36:33.711
Thanks for the update.

36:39.530 --> 36:41.555
Want to share it
with the class?

36:41.600 --> 36:43.659
When Nathan's ex told me
about the project,

36:43.700 --> 36:45.361
she did not mention

36:45.400 --> 36:47.425
he was in direct competition
with anybody.

36:47.470 --> 36:48.562
Now, his site is

36:48.600 --> 36:51.728
in Canarsie, Brooklyn,
on a piece of land that he owns.

36:51.770 --> 36:54.568
According to this article,
the other proposal

36:54.610 --> 36:55.804
isn't just in Queens.

36:55.840 --> 36:57.671
It's in Flushing.
Cray Fielder's threats

36:57.710 --> 36:59.678
weren't about padding
his legacy,

36:59.710 --> 37:01.769
they were about padding
his wallet.

37:07.350 --> 37:09.250
Apologies for
keeping you waiting.

37:09.290 --> 37:10.450
Our meeting ran late.

37:10.490 --> 37:11.923
I've been here, like, two hours.

37:11.960 --> 37:13.757
W-why am I here?

37:13.790 --> 37:16.725
Did you know that during the
Great New England Vampire Panic

37:16.760 --> 37:18.489
of the early 19th century,

37:18.530 --> 37:20.498
citizens of Vermont
and Rhode Island

37:20.530 --> 37:22.737
altered their routes
to and from their homes

37:22.770 --> 37:24.533
to avoid going near cemeteries?

37:24.570 --> 37:26.299
They were worried their
deceased loved ones

37:26.340 --> 37:29.309
would emerge from the graves
and attack them.

37:30.340 --> 37:31.568
What?

37:31.610 --> 37:33.373
Not unlike the
yellow fever scare,

37:33.410 --> 37:34.911
which took hold
of the American South

37:34.950 --> 37:36.474
during the 1870s.

37:36.520 --> 37:38.340
Citizens of Jackson,
Mississippi, for example,

37:38.390 --> 37:40.608
were so terrified of the virus
that they ripped up

37:40.650 --> 37:42.618
railroad tracks
and burned bridges

37:42.660 --> 37:43.911
to stop
potentially infected outsiders

37:43.960 --> 37:45.928
from entering their city.

37:45.960 --> 37:49.919
My point is that fear
affects human geography.

37:49.960 --> 37:51.928
It affects the way people
move through cities and...

37:51.970 --> 37:53.619
the way they evaluate
which places

37:53.670 --> 37:55.365
they'll visit
and which they'll avoid.

37:55.400 --> 37:57.561
But you already know
that-- it's the reason

37:57.600 --> 38:00.763
you and Nathan Resor
started setting off bombs
in Flushing a few weeks ago.

38:00.810 --> 38:05.008
(laughs): I told you,
I'm not working with Nathan.

38:05.050 --> 38:07.678
We know.
You were working for him.

38:07.710 --> 38:09.575
When you were in
prison together,

38:09.620 --> 38:11.884
you told him you were
the Bensonhurst Bomber.

38:11.920 --> 38:14.411
Not sure why, but it
doesn't really matter now.

38:14.460 --> 38:16.587
The important thing is
he was the only one

38:16.620 --> 38:18.588
who knew your secret.

38:18.630 --> 38:20.621
Now, when a piece of land
he owned in Canarsie became

38:20.660 --> 38:23.629
one of two finalists
for the site of an
entertaInment complex

38:23.660 --> 38:25.628
worth hundreds
of millions of dollars,

38:25.670 --> 38:27.592
he decided
he needed an edge.

38:27.630 --> 38:29.598
BELL: He told you to
resume your activities

38:29.640 --> 38:31.631
as the Bensonhurst Bomber
in the neighborhood

38:31.670 --> 38:34.503
that surrounded the competing
property in Flushing.

38:34.540 --> 38:37.077
The ensuing explosions
would create

38:37.110 --> 38:38.873
bad press and fear
amongst the potential visitors

38:38.910 --> 38:40.741
to that location,

38:40.780 --> 38:43.112
making building there
a marketing nightmare.

38:43.150 --> 38:45.618
"Come for the shopping.
Stay for the fiery death."

38:45.650 --> 38:46.878
BELL:
The company

38:46.920 --> 38:48.615
looking to build
the pavilion

38:48.660 --> 38:51.049
would be forced to choose
Nathan's land in Canarsie.

38:51.090 --> 38:53.456
When they did, he
would make a fortune

38:53.490 --> 38:54.889
and you would get a cut.

38:54.930 --> 38:57.057
I hope it was
at least for half.

38:57.100 --> 38:58.658
I mean, you did
all the work.

39:00.470 --> 39:02.893
You are wrong.

39:02.940 --> 39:05.101
I blow stuff up
because I have to,

39:05.140 --> 39:07.005
because I am sick.

39:07.040 --> 39:09.577
You're attempting
to lie to us because
you stI|| thInk

39:09.610 --> 39:11.749
that your family's in
line for your share.

39:11.780 --> 39:13.907
They're not.
The meeting that
we were just at,

39:13.950 --> 39:16.646
it was with a company called
Lighthouse Amusements.

39:16.680 --> 39:18.841
WATSON: They're
the ones building the
entertainment complex

39:18.890 --> 39:20.619
on Nathan's land.

39:20.650 --> 39:21.981
Or they were.

39:22.020 --> 39:23.988
When we sat down with
them this morning

39:24.020 --> 39:27.922
and explained your plot, they
voided the contract with him.

39:27.960 --> 39:30.849
The project's been put
on indefinite hold.

39:30.900 --> 39:33.596
You're lying.
The people
at Lighthouse

39:33.630 --> 39:37.168
were kind enough to provide
copies of the voided contract.

39:37.200 --> 39:39.668
So there you are.
Help yourself.

39:39.710 --> 39:42.031
WATSON: There's no payday
coming, Mr. Fielder.

39:42.080 --> 39:44.640
There's no money
for you or your family.

39:44.680 --> 39:46.102
It's over.

39:46.150 --> 39:48.004
Do yourself
a favor--

39:48.050 --> 39:49.847
give us Nathan.

39:49.880 --> 39:52.986
There's really no reason you
can't be reunited behind bars.

39:57.790 --> 39:59.553
(sighs)
Good day to be

39:59.590 --> 40:01.820
in the punishment business,
wouldn't you agree?

40:03.460 --> 40:06.429
WATSON:
Great day, actually.

40:06.470 --> 40:07.596
Nothing you said
the other day

40:07.630 --> 40:10.064
upset me, by the way--
quite the opposite.

40:10.100 --> 40:12.637
Good to know
what's been on your mind.

40:13.670 --> 40:15.206
I appreciate that.

40:15.240 --> 40:16.707
(door closes)

40:17.840 --> 40:19.569
HOLMES:
There are studies that say

40:19.610 --> 40:22.078
those two never had a chance.

40:22.120 --> 40:26.216
The Bureau of Justice Statistics
estimates that nearly two-thirds

40:26.250 --> 40:28.218
of the 405,000 prisoners
released in 2005

40:28.250 --> 40:30.980
were arrested for a new crime
WIthIn three years.

40:33.860 --> 40:34.929
within five years.

40:34.960 --> 40:36.621
Staggering recidivism rates,

40:36.660 --> 40:38.821
even for a country
as jail-happy as this one.

40:39.870 --> 40:41.861
Why are you telling me this?

40:43.200 --> 40:45.703
I'm merely observing
that reentry into society

40:45.740 --> 40:47.059
is no mean feat.

40:47.110 --> 40:50.102
For the truly evil,
the path back to prison

40:50.140 --> 40:52.643
is as inevitable as the sun
rISIng In the east.

40:52.680 --> 40:54.716
But for the others...

40:54.750 --> 40:57.969
uh... some of them
just need a little help.

41:00.190 --> 41:01.987
Right?

41:06.130 --> 41:10.920
* Still sweatin'
from the rush *

41:10.960 --> 41:13.724
* His body tense

41:13.770 --> 41:16.534
* His hands, they...

41:16.570 --> 41:19.767
SHINWELL:
Who's there?
It's Joan.

41:20.870 --> 41:22.735
* Oh, this...

41:22.780 --> 41:23.804
Hey.

41:23.840 --> 41:25.239
Hey, Doc.

41:25.280 --> 41:27.908
Uh... what are
you doing here?

41:27.950 --> 41:30.578
I was just thinking
about what you asked me

41:30.620 --> 41:33.248
the other day
about how to change.
Uh-huh?

41:33.290 --> 41:37.078
I think the answer is
to let people help you.

41:39.090 --> 41:40.728
If you're free,
I thought we could go

41:40.760 --> 41:44.764
for a walk, maybe talk
about how you're set up here.

41:45.800 --> 41:47.222
Yeah.

41:47.270 --> 41:49.761
Just let me get my coat.

41:54.610 --> 41:58.137
* Don't you

41:58.180 --> 41:59.977
* Ever

42:00.010 --> 42:03.275
* Leave me alone

42:05.650 --> 42:07.709
* My worries...

42:14.600 --> 42:19.765
* I am a sad boy...
