01:38.765 --> 01:40.688
Let me see what's on cameras one and four.

01:44.605 --> 01:47.108
Come on. I know you're here somewhere.

01:47.524 --> 01:50.698
Three years I've been waiting
to nail your sorry ass.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.911
I think we might have something here.

01:55.741 --> 01:57.835
Punch me up, please.

02:05.709 --> 02:08.487
That's his bodyguard
who's always with him.

02:08.586 --> 02:10.840
And there's Cota.

02:14.676 --> 02:18.897
Welcome to our little party.
Page, Cota has arrived.

02:19.890 --> 02:21.437
He's coming in now.

02:21.558 --> 02:25.153
He's wearing a cape and a silver mask.
Tell your men to keep their eyes open.

02:26.396 --> 02:29.967
This is Page to all operatives.
Cota is on his way in.

02:30.067 --> 02:32.490
Keep him under strict surveillance.

02:47.084 --> 02:48.461
Holy shit!

02:48.585 --> 02:51.321
Get a load of the melons
on the belly dancer.

02:51.421 --> 02:54.300
Okay, now just keep your eyes on Cota.

03:19.116 --> 03:22.352
Finally you get Cota outside San Carlos.

03:22.452 --> 03:25.797
This is gonna be
the biggest bust of the decade.

03:26.832 --> 03:27.879
All right.

03:28.083 --> 03:30.085
All agents are in position.

03:30.293 --> 03:31.761
Page,

03:31.962 --> 03:34.340
tell your agents to move in. Now!

03:35.215 --> 03:37.217
Move in. Repeat, move in.

03:58.071 --> 04:01.746
Ramon Cota,
you're under arrest for drug...

04:01.867 --> 04:03.665
What the...

04:04.828 --> 04:06.647
Who the hell is this?

04:06.747 --> 04:08.749
Oh, shit.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.047
We've been set up.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.753
Where's Cota?
Where's Ramon Cota, damn you?

04:46.286 --> 04:51.167
I don't recognize you. If you can't show
me an invitation, I order you to leave.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.682
Agent Page,

05:49.266 --> 05:53.316
don't you know by now
that it's not possible to arrest me

05:53.812 --> 05:56.691
or even disrupt my business activities?

05:56.898 --> 05:58.800
But it is possible to annoy me

05:58.900 --> 06:03.346
and I should treat you the same way
that I treated your colleagues,

06:03.446 --> 06:08.560
but life can be so unexpectedly short,
Agent Page.

06:08.660 --> 06:11.789
So, enjoy it while you can.

06:19.421 --> 06:21.139
You laid the son of a gun, didn't you?

06:21.756 --> 06:24.117
- Something wrong?
- Hello, little lady.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.639
Come here, bitch.

06:27.053 --> 06:29.873
- Are you sure?
- I was only teasing.

06:29.973 --> 06:32.709
But our kid will have
a loving mother and father,

06:32.809 --> 06:35.813
and all the advantages
that I can give him.

06:35.937 --> 06:40.842
Him? Him. You've already decided
the baby's gonna be a boy?

06:40.942 --> 06:42.944
With a stud like me, what else?

06:43.236 --> 06:45.472
She could be a ballet dancer.

06:45.572 --> 06:50.811
- That's all I need, two wild women.
- That might be exactly what you get, too.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.539
How do you expect us
to eat this gook shit?

06:56.124 --> 06:57.626
I see that look in your eye.

06:59.669 --> 07:01.171
I'm not going to fight.

07:05.008 --> 07:06.601
Listen, Charlie Chan...

07:09.930 --> 07:11.682
You think you ought to help him?

07:13.141 --> 07:16.378
Excuse me, guys.
Let me help you up, Mr. Quon.

07:16.478 --> 07:18.572
No, there's only three of 'em.

07:20.148 --> 07:23.260
You were trying the wrong techniques
against these skinheads.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.929
- No offense, guys.
- Who the fuck are you?

07:26.029 --> 07:27.827
An elbow would've been a lot better.

07:34.037 --> 07:35.414
Asshole.

07:42.337 --> 07:43.759
Come here.

07:45.215 --> 07:48.344
Personally, Mr. Quon,
I think your food is great.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.959
Don't you?

07:56.059 --> 07:58.187
- I didn't hear you.
- Yeah, yeah.

07:59.062 --> 08:00.735
Then pay him and get the hell outta here.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.735
Thanks.

08:07.529 --> 08:10.123
When he left the table,
didn't he say he wasn't gonna fight?

08:11.074 --> 08:12.621
I didn't fight.

08:13.410 --> 08:15.037
I gave a motivational seminar.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.853
Miguel, I've missed you.

08:56.953 --> 08:59.047
- How was Rio?
- Fine.

09:05.128 --> 09:06.801
Miguel...

09:07.964 --> 09:10.968
Let me have the figures
on the latest coca distribution.

09:21.728 --> 09:26.234
We've had eight shipments
intercepted by the DEA in one month.

09:27.150 --> 09:30.220
There is a spy in the organization.

09:30.320 --> 09:34.120
I will conduct the investigation
personally, jefe.

09:35.992 --> 09:36.993
Later.

09:38.161 --> 09:41.836
This afternoon I want you to fly to Miami
and see the distributors.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.557
Stop right here.

09:56.971 --> 09:58.598
Look at Papa.

10:14.072 --> 10:16.370
Why is the girl not harvesting the coca?

10:16.825 --> 10:19.874
She refuses to work.
She fears the sun will kill the baby.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.380
Well, put her to work.

10:23.039 --> 10:25.383
Bad example for the others.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.048
Okay, put her to work.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.806
- Give me the baby.
- No.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.158
No.

10:33.258 --> 10:35.477
- José.
- No, please don't.

10:35.927 --> 10:37.474
Quiquina!

10:38.304 --> 10:40.373
No! My baby!

10:40.473 --> 10:42.896
No! Stop!

10:52.735 --> 10:55.284
José... José...

11:01.578 --> 11:03.580
You want your baby?

11:10.420 --> 11:11.922
Get in the jeep.

11:23.516 --> 11:26.486
My baby... My baby...

11:29.731 --> 11:31.608
Take her to my bedroom.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.619
But first give her a beautiful bath.

11:35.778 --> 11:39.533
While she's there, get rid of the baby.

12:13.066 --> 12:16.195
General Taylor, Colonel McCoy
and Major Chavez are here.

12:16.694 --> 12:18.822
- Good. Send them in.
- Yes, sir.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.833
- Colonel McCoy.
- General.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.956
Major Chavez.

12:28.248 --> 12:32.318
This is George Fogerty. He heads
the Drug Enforcement Administration.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.341
- Major.
- And John Page,

12:34.629 --> 12:37.031
in charge of DEA activities in San Carlos.

12:37.131 --> 12:40.635
- A real pleasure. How do you do?
- Let's take a walk, boys.

12:49.102 --> 12:54.359
Gentlemen, the flow of cocaine
coming into the US is becoming a war.

12:55.108 --> 12:58.303
That damn drug has this country
in a stranglehold.

12:58.403 --> 13:01.122
That's why we need you
and the Delta Force.

13:03.491 --> 13:06.019
The President has made this
a top priority.

13:06.119 --> 13:09.794
I am to do whatever is necessary
to curtail this problem.

13:10.373 --> 13:14.048
Gentlemen, Ramon Cota,
the world's wealthiest drug dealer.

13:14.377 --> 13:18.553
Cota is wanted for drug trafficking
and murder in 17 countries.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.576
We have no extradition agreement
with San Carlos,

13:21.676 --> 13:24.680
but whenever he leaves,
he knows we're on to him.

13:24.929 --> 13:27.227
Why do they put up with that creep?

13:27.557 --> 13:31.419
President Alcazar is a well-intentioned
man, but he's hanging on by a thread.

13:31.519 --> 13:35.399
The real strength there is this guy...
General Olmedo.

13:37.191 --> 13:39.285
Goddamn ugly son of a bitch.

13:39.777 --> 13:42.246
He makes it possible for Cota
to stay in San Carlos.

13:42.405 --> 13:45.475
He takes a small share of the profits
to the amount of

13:45.575 --> 13:48.603
several hundred million dollars a year.

13:48.703 --> 13:50.922
What is it you want from us?

13:51.247 --> 13:55.318
I have an agent in Cota's organization.
I want you to tell him to come in.

13:55.418 --> 13:57.591
Excuse me? Why us, sir?

13:58.171 --> 14:00.740
He doesn't wanna be contacted by us,

14:00.840 --> 14:03.593
ever since the massacre
of our agents in Rio.

14:04.552 --> 14:08.352
You see, Cota was tipped off
by one of our very own.

14:10.266 --> 14:14.671
So, he wants someone from outside
just to pass on his information to him.

14:14.771 --> 14:18.651
That's why we contacted General Taylor
and he volunteered you two boys.

14:20.109 --> 14:23.955
I want you to tell him his life is
in jeopardy if he returns to San Carlos.

14:25.114 --> 14:26.457
How do we contact him?

14:27.116 --> 14:29.210
There's a taxi waiting for you, sir.

14:34.832 --> 14:39.303
We've been driving around for a half-hour.
How cautious does he have to be?

14:40.213 --> 14:44.263
If your butt was on the line,
you'd be a little bit cautious too.

14:58.106 --> 15:02.885
Listen carefully. In four days, Ramon will
fly to Switzerland on a commercial flight

15:02.985 --> 15:05.079
to deposit his money.

15:06.030 --> 15:10.476
Here's the details. Look, tell Fogerty
this may be our last chance.

15:10.576 --> 15:13.204
Since Rio, Ramon has stayed
closer to home.

15:13.788 --> 15:16.962
Fogerty wants you to come in.
He says it's too dangerous.

15:18.584 --> 15:22.822
Ramon trusts me like a brother.
He'll never suspect me.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.742
Hey, man, we're just telling you
what Fogerty told us.

15:25.842 --> 15:28.846
Hey, man, thanks. And I appreciate it.

15:29.971 --> 15:34.192
Hey, by the way... Does this airliner
fly over American airspace?

15:34.767 --> 15:38.738
Oh, yeah. Just south of the Florida Keys,
but only for a few minutes.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.741
Ramon always buys out
the first-class section,

15:42.024 --> 15:44.493
and he'll have two bodyguards with him.

15:52.702 --> 15:54.796
I see that look in your eye.

15:58.708 --> 16:01.257
Bobby, have you ever flown first class?

16:02.545 --> 16:04.468
Oh, man.

16:17.059 --> 16:19.337
I'm sorry, sir. This is first class only.

16:19.437 --> 16:23.112
- Can't I go to the bathroom?
- You'll have to use the one back there.

16:23.357 --> 16:25.451
You're in the wrong section.

16:37.330 --> 16:40.504
Tell them they'll see their boss
in about 50 years.

16:52.553 --> 16:53.805
What do we have here?

17:18.119 --> 17:20.248
You don't wanna do this.

17:20.665 --> 17:22.759
I'm Ramon Cota.

17:23.291 --> 17:24.464
You're dead.

17:40.935 --> 17:42.528
Okay, now what?

17:48.526 --> 17:51.029
I've found 'em. Here they are.

18:00.955 --> 18:03.049
I got contact on radar, General.

18:11.507 --> 18:13.384
One minute to jump time.

18:15.469 --> 18:17.767
- Put this on.
- I'm not gonna do it.

18:18.055 --> 18:19.728
It's a hijacking.

18:19.974 --> 18:23.524
Skyjacking's the proper word.
Now, put the goddamn thing on.

18:25.479 --> 18:26.526
No.

18:29.025 --> 18:31.653
You can go with the parachute
or without it.

18:31.902 --> 18:33.245
You're bluffing.

18:35.531 --> 18:38.643
Look, don't be a fool.
I'll make you rich. Come on.

18:38.743 --> 18:42.498
Millions. Come on, let me go.

18:42.913 --> 18:44.690
Come on, let me go.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.088
- Let me go.
- Okay.

19:06.771 --> 19:08.148
Oh, shit.

19:55.111 --> 19:58.285
Come on, grab the son of a bitch.
I know you can do it.

20:04.829 --> 20:06.672
Running out of time.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.809
Come on. You can make it.

20:41.615 --> 20:44.835
Shit. Always the hard way.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.261
I need a drink.

21:08.517 --> 21:11.087
Your Honor, there have been
so many violations

21:11.187 --> 21:14.298
of my client's rights,
I hardly know where to begin.

21:14.398 --> 21:18.386
Drug enforcement agents of the US
are prohibited by federal law

21:18.486 --> 21:21.347
from participating in arrests overseas.

21:21.447 --> 21:24.725
The bottom line here
is that my client has been kidnapped.

21:24.825 --> 21:25.851
Skynapped.

21:25.951 --> 21:30.502
I too am hampered, Mr. Ericson,
by the top-secret background of this case.

21:30.831 --> 21:32.942
But I am assured by George Fogerty

21:33.042 --> 21:38.344
that whomever delivered Mr. Cota
to the United States was not a DEA agent.

21:38.589 --> 21:42.618
Legal tradition denies American judges
the power to question the arrest

21:42.718 --> 21:46.689
or treatment of a suspect
before he enters our country.

21:46.972 --> 21:50.543
Mr. Cota's rights have been
perfectly respected by us.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.896
Motion for release is denied.

21:53.479 --> 21:57.200
Bail is set at ten million dollars.

22:00.236 --> 22:03.160
That's pocket change to that scumbag.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.088
Isn't democracy great?

22:19.755 --> 22:21.348
Marshals.

22:21.674 --> 22:24.177
We risked our lives for nothing.

22:24.635 --> 22:27.013
Order. Order in court.

22:28.597 --> 22:31.601
I said order. Order in the court.

22:32.643 --> 22:34.316
Mr. Cota...

22:35.396 --> 22:38.616
Mr. Cota, do you wish
to press charges against this man?

22:39.900 --> 22:43.530
No, Your Honor.
I'm not one to hold a grudge.

22:44.321 --> 22:45.789
Very well.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.747
Court's dismissed.

22:53.497 --> 22:55.591
Time to go, Carlos.

23:35.623 --> 23:38.126
All right.

23:42.546 --> 23:46.346
City play-offs, here we come.
That's my little brother.

23:50.679 --> 23:53.979
- That was fantastic.
- It was great.

23:56.185 --> 24:01.048
Bobby, why don't you and Scot go get
the pizza? Alex and I'll set the table.

24:01.148 --> 24:05.928
Then we'll see how much of the game you
recorded with all of your jumpin' around.

24:06.028 --> 24:10.266
- How about me jumping your bones?
- Bobby, cut it out. Everyone's watching.

24:10.366 --> 24:14.395
Let 'em be jealous.
I got the most beautiful wife. Right, son?

24:14.495 --> 24:16.772
- You're crazy.
- For you.

24:16.872 --> 24:19.421
Scot, will you get him outta here? Out.

24:20.334 --> 24:22.507
You heard the boss, lover boy.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.598
See you at home.

24:29.051 --> 24:30.369
Bobby was jumpin' around.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.830
- Scot was beaming.
- Scot was beaming?

24:32.930 --> 24:35.708
- And I baked you a cake.
- Chocolate?

24:35.808 --> 24:37.376
Yes.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.774
- Great.
- I'll get that.

24:42.064 --> 24:44.066
No, Rita.

24:44.525 --> 24:45.526
No.

24:48.696 --> 24:50.073
Alex.

25:07.172 --> 25:09.266
Who are you?

25:11.260 --> 25:12.978
Who are you?

25:13.637 --> 25:15.435
This is the wife?

25:21.562 --> 25:23.656
Get out of this house.

25:46.295 --> 25:48.548
You're squashin' the pizza, Bobby.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.427
What's goin' on?

26:24.833 --> 26:26.927
No, no. Rita...

26:32.216 --> 26:33.308
Rita...

26:35.677 --> 26:38.521
- Come on, sir. Let me help you.
- No, no, no...

27:12.172 --> 27:14.266
She's gone, Scott.

27:15.843 --> 27:18.078
My wife.

27:18.178 --> 27:20.021
My baby.

27:20.764 --> 27:22.858
He's gonna die for it.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.028
We'll get him again.

27:26.311 --> 27:28.405
I'm not waitin'.

27:29.690 --> 27:31.784
I'm goin' after him now.

27:33.277 --> 27:35.371
I can't let you do that.

27:40.409 --> 27:42.207
You would stop me?

27:44.037 --> 27:46.131
I'd have to.

27:50.252 --> 27:51.925
Look...

27:52.796 --> 27:55.299
Why don't you come to my place and stay?

27:59.344 --> 28:01.438
Yeah, maybe that's a good idea.

28:06.935 --> 28:08.608
Come on.

28:11.231 --> 28:13.325
We'll go see Fogerty tomorrow.

28:21.033 --> 28:23.707
Argentina charging for the ball.

28:40.886 --> 28:43.309
Martinez of Argentina takes a spill.

28:44.181 --> 28:46.275
The umpire calls time.

29:11.416 --> 29:14.194
- Stop right there.
- All right, turn around.

29:14.294 --> 29:15.796
Walk.

29:29.685 --> 29:34.256
You can see, ladies and gentlemen,
why Raul Salinas is a nine-grader.

29:34.356 --> 29:37.155
Last year, he was
Arena Player of the Year.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.644
Final score,

29:47.744 --> 29:51.624
San Carlos 4, Argentina 1.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.742
Are you crazy, Major Chavez?

30:19.109 --> 30:21.578
You are one very lucky SOB.

30:21.945 --> 30:24.915
- Page, what are you doing here?
- That doesn't matter.

30:25.032 --> 30:28.707
What does matter is you're leaving
and never coming back.

30:29.119 --> 30:31.713
I could've had him. I was so close.

30:31.955 --> 30:34.128
You were close, amigo.

30:34.333 --> 30:37.712
We were all close,
but we've got to do this thing right.

31:39.856 --> 31:41.984
Take a seat, Miguel.

31:48.990 --> 31:53.416
This is a very sad day for me.

31:54.496 --> 31:56.965
I have been betrayed by one of you.

31:57.999 --> 32:01.094
No, Ramon. It cannot be.

32:05.173 --> 32:07.392
Name this scum.

32:08.009 --> 32:10.512
I will order his execution.

32:11.263 --> 32:13.891
It is not necessary. I have my own ways

32:14.599 --> 32:17.102
of dealing with traitors.

32:20.355 --> 32:25.344
Miguel, have you discovered the identity

32:25.444 --> 32:29.620
of the one who has been informing
the DEA of my operations?

32:30.073 --> 32:32.622
No, Ramon, not yet.

32:34.619 --> 32:36.462
Why is that, my brother?

32:51.219 --> 32:55.645
Is it possible
that you have not found the man

32:57.225 --> 32:59.273
because you are that man?

32:59.394 --> 33:01.442
No, Ramon, no.

33:02.397 --> 33:04.399
I love you like a brother.

33:05.817 --> 33:07.911
You know I would die for you.

33:10.280 --> 33:14.410
I am very glad to hear that, Miguel.

33:27.464 --> 33:32.595
You were the only one
I trusted with my travel plans.

33:41.186 --> 33:43.280
Him, I loved.

33:59.329 --> 34:02.107
They won't forget me, you son of a bitch.

34:02.207 --> 34:04.301
You're gonna die.

34:34.572 --> 34:36.416
Please.

34:37.534 --> 34:39.143
André, UPI.

34:39.244 --> 34:42.043
Any word on the DEA hostages
in San Carlos?

34:42.163 --> 34:44.507
They're alive. That's all we know.

34:46.835 --> 34:48.904
Lucille, Washington Post.

34:49.004 --> 34:53.699
What about the rumor that an officer
in your top-secret commando unit

34:53.800 --> 34:59.102
tried to infiltrate into San Carlos and
was brutally murdered by Ramon Cota?

34:59.431 --> 35:02.083
I have no commando unit under my command,

35:02.183 --> 35:04.711
nor am I aware of the existence
of any such force.

35:04.811 --> 35:06.484
General...

35:07.856 --> 35:11.134
The DEA has received
heavy criticism for its failure

35:11.234 --> 35:14.387
to slow the flow of narcotics into the US.

35:14.487 --> 35:17.599
Do you believe that the army
will have more success?

35:17.699 --> 35:20.435
All right, listen up,
ladies and gentlemen.

35:20.535 --> 35:24.585
It's very difficult to deal
with a country like San Carlos

35:25.206 --> 35:30.053
where a large percentage of the cocaine
entering the United States originates,

35:30.211 --> 35:33.966
where the military Chief of Staff,
General Olmedo,

35:35.216 --> 35:40.723
grows coca on a private farm
the size of Rhode Island,

35:40.930 --> 35:44.626
where a drug king like Ramon Cota

35:44.726 --> 35:50.131
can live like an oriental potentate
without any fear of extradition,

35:50.231 --> 35:56.580
and where President Alcazar is afraid
to do anything about it for fear of a coup.

35:56.905 --> 35:58.077
Good morning.

36:08.083 --> 36:09.426
Ladies and gentlemen,

36:09.668 --> 36:14.765
General Taylor has slapped the face
of every honest citizen of San Carlos.

36:15.048 --> 36:17.617
Certainly, we have
a narcotics problem in our country

36:17.717 --> 36:19.970
and we are struggling against it.

36:20.595 --> 36:25.166
But if America accuses us
of being a nation of drug pushers,

36:25.266 --> 36:28.611
then we accuse America
of being a nation of drug addicts.

36:49.290 --> 36:50.837
What's going on, General?

36:53.461 --> 36:56.135
Ramon sent us a video tape.

36:56.464 --> 37:01.311
Three of our agents in San Carlos,
including Page, were captured by Ramon.

37:02.512 --> 37:04.640
We have verification.

37:07.392 --> 37:09.486
What about Bobby?

37:35.003 --> 37:37.552
They won't forget me, you son of a bitch.

37:38.047 --> 37:41.927
You're gonna die.
They're gonna remember me.

37:53.062 --> 37:55.360
I'd love to go after this asshole.

38:17.253 --> 38:18.300
You.

39:29.993 --> 39:32.337
These are aerial recon photos

39:32.579 --> 39:35.924
of Ramon's compound made yesterday.

39:39.502 --> 39:41.800
The fortress is unapproachable.

39:42.005 --> 39:46.135
There's over one hundred armed men
in sight in these shots here.

39:47.093 --> 39:50.413
Take more than an infiltration unit
to extract those agents.

39:50.513 --> 39:52.641
Take a goddamn invasion.

39:52.807 --> 39:56.311
Plus, there's only one road
to the top of the mountain.

39:56.644 --> 39:58.271
All switchbacks,

39:58.813 --> 40:01.316
heavily guarded on all three sides.

40:02.483 --> 40:04.531
Most mountains have four sides.

40:05.695 --> 40:07.368
Yeah.

40:09.782 --> 40:13.127
But the fourth side
of this particular mountain

40:13.494 --> 40:16.168
is a sheer wall of granite.

40:17.498 --> 40:19.592
Straight up.

40:20.835 --> 40:23.088
They say it's unclimbable.

40:28.384 --> 40:32.890
- I asked not to be disturbed.
- But you're wanted on the red phone, sir.

40:36.017 --> 40:38.065
Back in one minute, Colonel.

40:59.040 --> 41:00.792
That was the President.

41:01.042 --> 41:05.718
He just viewed the video tape I left him
of Ramon torturing Major Chavez.

41:06.255 --> 41:08.199
He blew his stack.

41:08.299 --> 41:12.020
He called President Alcazar in San Carlos

41:12.220 --> 41:16.541
and threatened to withdraw
economic aid if he didn't cooperate.

41:16.641 --> 41:17.984
All right.

41:18.810 --> 41:20.169
Now,

41:20.269 --> 41:24.820
there's only authority
to go in for one day

41:25.775 --> 41:28.824
and burn whatever drug crops
and labs we can find.

41:29.153 --> 41:31.326
What about the DEA agents Cota's got?

41:34.492 --> 41:36.586
If we get our boys out or not,

41:38.079 --> 41:40.127
it's gonna be up to us.

41:43.292 --> 41:46.091
President Alcazar
washes his hands of that one.

41:46.337 --> 41:48.431
When do we go in?

41:50.091 --> 41:52.185
One week from today.

41:53.803 --> 41:58.583
Gives us plenty of time to pinpoint
all the fields, coordinate everything...

41:58.683 --> 42:02.358
I'll be ready. Better put these away
before you lose one.

42:06.691 --> 42:09.160
Not fast enough. One more time.

42:14.282 --> 42:15.955
Cover me.

42:31.299 --> 42:32.346
Get down.

43:00.495 --> 43:03.106
You did all right. You okay?

43:03.206 --> 43:04.378
Yeah.

43:13.257 --> 43:15.351
Take over, Major.

43:16.052 --> 43:18.225
- Feeling better now?
- Yeah, I do.

43:19.680 --> 43:21.774
They don't.

43:23.684 --> 43:26.062
The word on the operation has leaked.

43:26.187 --> 43:30.363
The whole world knows we're coming.
The only thing they don't know is when.

43:31.067 --> 43:34.947
- What are we going to do?
- We're going to proceed as planned.

43:35.571 --> 43:37.699
The only hitch is,

43:37.865 --> 43:40.584
our boy Ramon sent a message to Fogerty.

43:42.120 --> 43:46.482
He swears he'll execute
all three DEA agents

43:46.582 --> 43:51.088
the instant any American military unit
touches down in San Carlos.

43:55.383 --> 43:57.431
Let me go in 48 hours ahead.

43:58.219 --> 44:00.267
I'll get them out.

44:01.139 --> 44:04.564
- You mean you'll go up that mountain?
- I can climb it.

44:07.728 --> 44:09.922
- Operations.
- This is General Taylor.

44:10.022 --> 44:13.301
- Have you prepared that C-130?
- Afﬁrmative.

44:13.401 --> 44:16.075
We'll be at the hangar
0300 hours tomorrow.

44:22.243 --> 44:25.964
Alice 1-7, this is Bookshelf.
We have you on schedule.

44:26.080 --> 44:30.586
- Please acknowledge.
- Roger, Bookshelf. Alice 1-7 is on time.

44:32.253 --> 44:38.181
At 0530 hours the day after tomorrow,
we start destroying the labs and fields.

44:38.301 --> 44:42.705
At 0730 hours,
I hit Ramon's munitions warehouse.

44:42.805 --> 44:45.775
Now you gotta be outta there by that time.

44:47.685 --> 44:51.110
- I'm gonna retire after this.
- You say that every time.

44:52.523 --> 44:55.218
Come on. Let's get outta here.

44:55.318 --> 44:57.446
I just might mean it this time.

45:04.452 --> 45:06.625
- Everything is ready, Colonel.
- Okay.

45:14.003 --> 45:19.225
Your contact in the village is an Indian
girl by the name of Quiquina Esquilinta.

45:20.384 --> 45:22.245
We trust her?

45:22.345 --> 45:26.145
Ramon killed her husband,
murdered her sick baby,

45:26.474 --> 45:30.229
then used the baby's body to smuggle
cocaine, and then he raped her.

45:30.770 --> 45:32.818
You've got one minute to jump.

45:33.022 --> 45:36.092
Probably be a good idea
not to bring it up when you meet.

45:36.192 --> 45:39.262
- She might be a little sensitive.
- I'd think so.

45:39.362 --> 45:40.989
- Ready, Colonel?
- Ready, Major.

45:45.368 --> 45:48.338
- I'll see ya.
- Now remember,

45:48.788 --> 45:52.292
your objective is the DEA guys,

45:52.625 --> 45:54.673
not Ramon Cota.

45:54.919 --> 45:56.387
I'll remember.

45:57.755 --> 45:59.348
I'll bet.

46:02.385 --> 46:04.513
Always the hard way.

46:22.530 --> 46:25.409
- Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I'm...
- Come.

46:27.743 --> 46:29.871
Nice to meet you, too.

46:51.058 --> 46:53.106
- Hola, Quiquina.
- Hello.

46:56.897 --> 46:59.070
Quiquina. Quiquina.

47:09.160 --> 47:12.130
This is El Jefe.
He knew you were going to come.

47:14.081 --> 47:17.676
- Welcome to our village.
- Thank you, Jefe. Where can I change?

47:18.919 --> 47:20.171
My home.

47:48.657 --> 47:50.935
- Hello, sir. I'm Ernesto Flores.
- Who?

47:51.035 --> 47:54.188
- Ernesto Flores.
- How you doin'? Major Anderson.

47:54.288 --> 47:58.150
Nice to meet you, sir. I have been
appointed by President Alcazar...

47:58.250 --> 48:00.194
- Who?
- President Alcazar.

48:00.294 --> 48:04.115
To act as an observer
and to see that you adhere to the...

48:04.215 --> 48:05.574
What does "adhere" mean?

48:05.674 --> 48:08.223
To the agreement
between our two presidents.

48:08.886 --> 48:10.308
Yes, sir.

48:13.015 --> 48:16.127
My people have used
these lianas for centuries.

48:16.227 --> 48:18.321
That's what I was afraid of.

48:46.924 --> 48:48.267
Watch out.

48:50.386 --> 48:55.062
- Your backpack is too heavy. Drop it.
- Forget it, lady. I need this pack.

48:55.224 --> 48:59.024
There must have been some fat Indians
who had to get across.

49:08.821 --> 49:12.892
Excuse me, Major, but what is
the meaning of the different colors?

49:12.992 --> 49:16.479
The red indicate drug laboratories,
the green are coca fields,

49:16.579 --> 49:18.673
and the blue is an airstrip.

49:21.417 --> 49:24.546
- And how do you know that?
- Aerial photography.

49:25.337 --> 49:30.468
Infrared cameras pick up the heat from
lamps used to process the coca paste.

49:31.635 --> 49:34.559
Coca leaves radiate irregular wavelengths,

49:34.805 --> 49:36.978
different from corn and wheat.

49:38.976 --> 49:41.070
Wish my Polaroid could do that.

50:14.220 --> 50:16.455
Espinoza del Diablo.

50:16.555 --> 50:17.807
Oh, boy.

50:18.140 --> 50:20.268
Can you climb it?

50:21.810 --> 50:26.941
Well, anything's possible.
At least, that's what I've been told.

50:29.735 --> 50:31.032
Better get some sleep.

50:53.467 --> 50:56.266
Hey, General, why are these soldiers here?

50:57.388 --> 50:59.732
They're here to observe, Ernesto.

51:02.226 --> 51:04.320
You notice they have no weapons?

51:06.855 --> 51:09.574
- Do you notice?
- I noticed.

51:33.007 --> 51:35.101
Your family?

51:36.135 --> 51:38.229
My husband...

51:39.638 --> 51:41.732
And my baby.

51:53.694 --> 51:55.788
I know what happened.

51:56.989 --> 51:58.036
I'm sorry.

52:14.340 --> 52:16.434
God be with you.

52:18.177 --> 52:20.271
Thank you.

53:06.684 --> 53:09.420
Look at this map.
This one's going to the south.

53:09.520 --> 53:13.946
- This area here?
- Yeah. And those go to the north.

53:16.151 --> 53:18.245
Hey, Ernesto...

53:19.279 --> 53:24.160
All the big coca fields seem to be
south of our corridor of operation.

53:24.785 --> 53:27.813
I don't make the rules, General.
I just follow them.

53:27.913 --> 53:29.982
I can see that, Ernesto.

53:30.082 --> 53:33.402
Isn't this General Olmedo's ranch?

53:33.502 --> 53:35.596
This huge area right here?

53:36.380 --> 53:40.260
It's about six miles from Ramon's estate,
isn't that right?

53:40.801 --> 53:42.474
Yeah, that's right.

53:42.886 --> 53:45.122
So how far is

53:45.222 --> 53:49.227
General Olmedo's air base, Ernesto?

53:49.476 --> 53:51.545
About 240 miles.

53:51.645 --> 53:53.672
240.

53:53.772 --> 53:55.866
Now, listen, General.

53:56.108 --> 53:58.802
- San Carlos is a sovereign country.
- I know.

53:58.902 --> 54:01.430
Not a puppet of the United States.

54:01.530 --> 54:02.973
- Do you understand?
- I do.

54:03.073 --> 54:08.062
You will stay within the corridor defined
by President Alcazar. Is that clear?

54:08.162 --> 54:09.209
It's clear.

54:09.580 --> 54:12.504
Lighten up, Ernesto. Cool down.

54:12.875 --> 54:14.568
- Excuse me.
- It's all right.

54:14.668 --> 54:17.154
Let's have a cup of coffee
and calm down, huh?

54:17.254 --> 54:19.348
- What do you say?
- Thank you.

54:50.704 --> 54:52.832
How'd you get up here?

55:30.577 --> 55:33.922
I was told that a parachute
landed near here.

55:34.373 --> 55:38.253
Who is the owner of the parachute?

55:56.603 --> 56:00.107
Don't kill him. It isn't his fault.

56:00.357 --> 56:04.612
An American came here, but he's gone.

56:18.125 --> 56:20.469
If the American escapes,

56:22.671 --> 56:25.550
I will have to kill everybody
in the village.

57:30.447 --> 57:32.495
I have just received this message.

57:32.783 --> 57:35.018
This morning, at dawn,

57:35.118 --> 57:39.523
in a series of surprise military raids,
the army of San Carlos,

57:39.623 --> 57:44.094
under the direct and personal leadership
of General Olmedo,

57:44.503 --> 57:50.351
destroyed seven laboratories
and burned 100,000 acres of coca fields.

57:51.093 --> 57:52.536
What the hell are you talking about?

57:52.636 --> 57:57.583
President Alcazar has informed
your president

57:57.683 --> 58:00.778
there will be no American interference,

58:01.186 --> 58:03.797
General Taylor, my friend.

58:03.897 --> 58:05.991
Your mission is canceled.

58:11.530 --> 58:13.203
Hey, take it easy.

58:13.615 --> 58:15.642
No hard feelings, my friend.

58:15.742 --> 58:17.995
Take it easy. Here, this is for you.

58:29.172 --> 58:32.221
General, what about the DEA agents?

58:34.428 --> 58:36.522
What about Colonel McCoy?

59:24.644 --> 59:26.738
Carlos...

59:28.106 --> 59:32.010
Take personal charge of security tonight.

59:32.110 --> 59:35.389
- Tell them, shoot anything that moves.
- Yes, jefe.

59:35.489 --> 59:37.457
- No exceptions.
- No problem.

59:57.052 --> 59:59.680
Any word from the President?

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:06.962
For security, all our calls had to be coded,
then relayed through our base in Texas.

01:00:07.062 --> 01:00:09.485
It's taking more time than I figured.

01:00:12.067 --> 01:00:14.411
Time is the one thing we haven't got.

01:00:47.936 --> 01:00:50.213
We decoded the relay from Washington.

01:00:50.313 --> 01:00:55.661
The San Carlos army raids were a hoax.
They burned the farmers' huts and fields.

01:00:56.111 --> 01:00:59.615
- Believe me, the President is pissed.
- Do we have a go?

01:01:00.323 --> 01:01:04.920
We have a go. An aircraft carrier
will pick us up ten miles off the coast.

01:01:06.246 --> 01:01:09.357
Send the transport home,
and get my men on my gunship.

01:01:09.457 --> 01:01:12.569
Wait a minute.
You don't have permission from me.

01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:16.907
- I must check with President Alcazar.
- Check with anybody you want.

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:21.308
All I know is, I'm gonna be in the air
whether you're on board or not.

01:01:30.812 --> 01:01:35.818
General Taylor, you can't leave yet.
I haven't been able to contact anybody.

01:01:36.735 --> 01:01:41.241
Why don't you come along for the ride,
Ernesto? They're not armed.

01:01:46.661 --> 01:01:49.414
- Got it, sir?
- Let's go.

01:02:57.274 --> 01:02:58.550
This is Wild Card.

01:02:58.650 --> 01:03:00.677
Go ahead, Wild Card.

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:02.554
Stranglehold is a go.

01:03:02.654 --> 01:03:05.578
- I'm in.
- Affirmative, Wild Card.

01:03:07.659 --> 01:03:09.728
Stranglehold is a go, boys.

01:03:09.828 --> 01:03:11.897
So let's lock and load.

01:03:11.997 --> 01:03:14.065
It's time to observe.

01:03:14.165 --> 01:03:16.463
What? What is this "Stranglehold"?

01:03:17.043 --> 01:03:18.386
My God.

01:03:19.004 --> 01:03:20.697
What are those weapons?

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:23.283
You lied to me, dammit.

01:03:23.383 --> 01:03:25.477
This gunship is armed.

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:30.724
- General Taylor, what are you doing?
- Taking a detour.

01:03:30.849 --> 01:03:33.398
- You can't do this.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

01:03:34.394 --> 01:03:37.130
Goddammit.

01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:39.324
What's going on?

01:04:13.016 --> 01:04:14.734
Go!

01:04:19.356 --> 01:04:20.983
Go!

01:04:23.777 --> 01:04:26.263
Hey, what the hell are those guys doing?

01:04:26.363 --> 01:04:28.786
They're just stretching their legs.

01:04:29.783 --> 01:04:31.877
Take her up.

01:06:03.334 --> 01:06:04.836
Jesus Christ.

01:06:16.181 --> 01:06:17.728
All right.

01:06:17.891 --> 01:06:19.564
Red target one.

01:06:20.185 --> 01:06:21.937
- Two o'clock.
- What?

01:06:22.353 --> 01:06:24.606
No, no. This is not red target one.

01:06:24.981 --> 01:06:27.075
You are too far south.

01:06:27.901 --> 01:06:30.029
You are outside the corridor.

01:06:48.379 --> 01:06:52.617
Stop this now. You are not allowed to
destroy property in the green sector.

01:06:52.717 --> 01:06:54.786
Only in the red sector.

01:06:54.886 --> 01:06:58.060
I prefer the drug labs
in the green sector better.

01:07:05.522 --> 01:07:07.616
Son of a bitch.

01:07:31.047 --> 01:07:33.283
General Olmedo's residence.

01:07:33.383 --> 01:07:35.910
The workmen will see you.

01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:40.540
Well, let them see me. Maybe they
would appreciate me more than you do.

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:45.066
General, it is the foreman at Field Seven.
He says it's an emergency.

01:08:11.337 --> 01:08:13.510
What? Shit.

01:08:16.509 --> 01:08:17.761
Red alert.

01:08:55.214 --> 01:08:59.618
Sir, General Olmedo's gunships
have left San Carlos air-force base.

01:08:59.719 --> 01:09:02.268
Estimated time of arrival, 26 minutes.

01:09:40.468 --> 01:09:42.640
I'm warning you, General Taylor.

01:09:43.888 --> 01:09:45.982
I stand warned.

01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:50.020
Targets seven and eight. Vector 1-8-6.

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:52.939
- Turn it south.
- Okay, sir.

01:11:50.473 --> 01:11:53.647
- Hi, guys.
- Colonel McCoy.

01:11:55.353 --> 01:11:57.447
I was just in the neighborhood.

01:12:01.526 --> 01:12:06.327
All clear. Make your way down the slope.
Our guys are waiting there. And hurry.

01:12:07.782 --> 01:12:09.876
What are you gonna do?

01:12:10.618 --> 01:12:13.121
I thought I'd pay respects to our host.

01:15:25.938 --> 01:15:28.487
How did you like the lesson?

01:15:28.899 --> 01:15:30.993
You're not so tough.

01:15:34.196 --> 01:15:37.166
My turn... To teach.

01:15:48.669 --> 01:15:50.797
Lesson number one.

01:15:59.305 --> 01:16:01.933
Guards. Guards.

01:16:02.641 --> 01:16:04.985
You son of a bitch.

01:16:20.618 --> 01:16:22.712
Lesson number two.

01:17:19.677 --> 01:17:21.771
School's out.

01:17:42.783 --> 01:17:45.332
Oh, very, very nice.

01:17:45.995 --> 01:17:48.089
Glad you liked it.

01:17:50.916 --> 01:17:53.010
Oh, yes.

01:18:00.176 --> 01:18:02.270
I loved it.

01:18:05.389 --> 01:18:06.686
Poor Carlos.

01:18:07.433 --> 01:18:11.378
I thought that he was the best,
but obviously, well,

01:18:11.478 --> 01:18:13.230
I was wrong.

01:18:16.275 --> 01:18:21.156
Oh, the eyes, truly,
are windows into the soul.

01:18:22.406 --> 01:18:24.750
Yours reveal so much.

01:18:26.493 --> 01:18:30.123
They tell me that you do not fear death,

01:18:32.249 --> 01:18:34.343
as I do not.

01:18:35.002 --> 01:18:39.929
So sad that we are on opposite sides.

01:18:40.341 --> 01:18:42.969
We would have been such a beautiful team.

01:18:44.136 --> 01:18:46.230
Not on your best day, pal.

01:18:48.265 --> 01:18:51.189
You're nothing but a chickenshit weasel

01:18:51.852 --> 01:18:54.355
who thrives on the misery of others.

01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:57.675
And when death calls,

01:18:57.775 --> 01:19:00.324
you'll be screaming like a baby.

01:19:09.245 --> 01:19:12.499
Oh, we're going to discover
who is going to scream.

01:19:18.128 --> 01:19:20.222
Take him to the chamber.

01:19:20.714 --> 01:19:23.137
The rest of you, find those other men.

01:19:43.737 --> 01:19:46.365
Oh, my friend,

01:19:47.825 --> 01:19:49.919
now that you are awake,

01:19:51.328 --> 01:19:55.003
I will talk to you about what
I have learned on my journey.

01:19:55.207 --> 01:19:57.926
The arrival of death can be so comforting.

01:19:58.544 --> 01:20:02.720
It is like the return
of a very beautiful companion.

01:20:03.215 --> 01:20:06.845
Its fire is soft and white...

01:20:07.386 --> 01:20:08.954
And gentle.

01:20:09.054 --> 01:20:13.776
And when it leaves, it frees the soul.

01:20:22.026 --> 01:20:24.745
I see something I recognize.

01:20:25.362 --> 01:20:28.081
Oh, my God. You are insane.

01:20:28.407 --> 01:20:31.661
Ramon Cota is the most powerful man
in this country.

01:20:31.869 --> 01:20:33.963
Do you want to commit suicide?

01:20:35.205 --> 01:20:36.252
Fire.

01:21:19.124 --> 01:21:21.218
Colonel McCoy.

01:21:28.467 --> 01:21:30.811
I'll have you outta here real quick.

01:21:44.066 --> 01:21:47.428
- What are you doing here?
- I told you you'd need help.

01:21:47.528 --> 01:21:50.702
- You weren't wrong.
- All right, what do we do now?

01:21:53.742 --> 01:21:55.352
Those stairs...

01:21:55.452 --> 01:21:59.707
Should lead down to the garage.
Start a car. I'll be right there.

01:23:03.896 --> 01:23:06.570
- We have the DEA agents.
- We're comin' in.

01:23:47.814 --> 01:23:49.441
Go!

01:23:59.451 --> 01:24:00.703
Look out.

01:24:21.139 --> 01:24:24.484
I'll be damned. This sucker's bulletproof.

01:24:25.102 --> 01:24:27.901
I guess Ramon did something right.

01:24:55.882 --> 01:24:58.931
Eagle One to Nighthawk.
Get ready to come aboard.

01:25:00.012 --> 01:25:01.685
Come on.

01:25:09.062 --> 01:25:11.656
Come on. Let's go. Move it.

01:25:45.307 --> 01:25:48.186
Sir, Page and Colonel McCoy aren't here.

01:25:48.393 --> 01:25:51.693
We can't wait. Let's go.
Come on, let's go.

01:26:28.350 --> 01:26:32.400
This is General Olmedo. Where is Ramon?

01:26:34.314 --> 01:26:38.069
He's in the limo.
We can't stop it because it's bulletproof.

01:26:50.372 --> 01:26:53.296
You're never gonna get out of this alive.

01:26:55.794 --> 01:26:57.842
Jesus.

01:27:03.635 --> 01:27:06.354
I wonder what you're gonna do now.

01:27:06.596 --> 01:27:08.690
My friend Olmedo is here.

01:27:11.017 --> 01:27:12.269
Do you see him?

01:27:13.729 --> 01:27:15.823
There he is, Colonel.

01:27:17.315 --> 01:27:20.990
I want you to destroy the limousine.

01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:24.823
Don't stare at me, you fool. Just do it.

01:27:31.204 --> 01:27:34.174
Shit. Olmedo means business.

01:27:41.506 --> 01:27:43.679
That's one hell of a friend, Cota.

01:28:06.823 --> 01:28:08.917
Hang on. Hang on.

01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:17.793
Okay, now. Let's hit him again.

01:28:33.016 --> 01:28:35.360
Keep after him.

01:28:59.084 --> 01:29:01.928
You two, come with me. Hurry.

01:29:06.466 --> 01:29:08.560
I don't see him anywhere.

01:29:11.388 --> 01:29:13.482
Look out, Colonel.

01:29:20.605 --> 01:29:23.905
Son of a bitch. Now I'm gonna kill him.

01:29:33.869 --> 01:29:35.337
Fire again.

01:29:49.342 --> 01:29:51.470
Get out. Come on.

01:29:59.102 --> 01:30:01.400
To the village. Let's go.

01:30:13.950 --> 01:30:16.749
I am going to enjoy this.

01:30:33.845 --> 01:30:37.725
- Oh, no. Don't do it.
- Bye-bye, asshole.

01:30:46.566 --> 01:30:48.677
Don't let them get away.

01:30:48.777 --> 01:30:50.871
Move out, Page.

01:31:10.548 --> 01:31:12.492
Watch it.

01:31:12.592 --> 01:31:14.139
Pull her up.

01:31:32.904 --> 01:31:36.641
- I thought I'd never see you again.
- Clear the village.

01:31:36.741 --> 01:31:40.086
There's no escape.
They'll all have to die.

01:31:40.745 --> 01:31:42.793
Page, put him in that hut.

01:31:53.883 --> 01:31:55.260
Look out.

01:32:19.951 --> 01:32:21.328
Eagle One, this is Wild Card.

01:32:21.578 --> 01:32:24.707
Eagle One, Eagle One,
this is Wild Card. Come in.

01:32:24.956 --> 01:32:28.756
Go ahead, Wild Card.
Where the hell are you?

01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:32.806
In the village. We're in a bad way.
I could sure use your help.

01:32:35.508 --> 01:32:36.885
Wild Card?

01:32:41.681 --> 01:32:43.649
My men are professionals.

01:32:44.059 --> 01:32:47.734
Now... Even the children will die.

01:32:48.563 --> 01:32:51.658
Yeah? You better keep your mouth shut.

01:32:52.692 --> 01:32:54.945
I'll blow your head off right here.

01:32:55.653 --> 01:32:57.576
Wild Card, give me your coordinates.

01:32:59.616 --> 01:33:01.309
- Wild Card.
- Get in the hut.

01:33:01.409 --> 01:33:02.501
Wild Card!

01:33:33.858 --> 01:33:35.927
Wild Card.

01:33:36.027 --> 01:33:38.246
- Goddammit.
- Hey, General.

01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:42.535
I order you to leave
San Carlos airspace at once.

01:33:45.829 --> 01:33:48.548
Why don't you shut the fuck up?

01:34:03.638 --> 01:34:05.311
Oh, boy.

01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:17.802
Come on.

01:34:17.902 --> 01:34:20.655
All right. Don't hit McCoy.

01:34:24.409 --> 01:34:26.286
Yeah.

01:34:50.768 --> 01:34:51.985
Ramon.

01:35:21.257 --> 01:35:23.326
Page. You okay?

01:35:23.426 --> 01:35:27.038
Never mind me. Cota got away.
The girl went after him that way.

01:35:27.138 --> 01:35:29.186
- Help's here.
- All right.

01:35:29.349 --> 01:35:34.546
Eagle One, Page is trapped in
the hut at one o'clock. The rest is yours.

01:35:34.646 --> 01:35:36.319
All right.

01:35:37.565 --> 01:35:38.987
Let's get 'em.

01:36:50.179 --> 01:36:51.396
Let's go.

01:36:52.015 --> 01:36:53.688
Go!

01:37:28.384 --> 01:37:29.601
Hold it.

01:37:54.369 --> 01:37:57.122
You were so good in bed.

01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:01.463
It was worth it...

01:38:04.962 --> 01:38:09.308
To kill your husband
and your baby for you.

01:38:55.847 --> 01:39:00.023
Don't let him live.

01:39:02.395 --> 01:39:04.068
Please...

01:39:36.012 --> 01:39:38.106
You son of a bitch.

01:39:46.314 --> 01:39:47.531
Kill me...

01:39:49.525 --> 01:39:51.778
If you have the courage.

01:40:05.041 --> 01:40:10.013
Hurry it up. Let's move out.
Page, where's Colonel McCoy?

01:40:10.421 --> 01:40:13.265
He went in the jungle after Cota.

01:40:14.008 --> 01:40:18.354
Eagle's Nest to Eagle One. Enemy aircraft
are 30 miles out. Return to sanctuary.

01:40:18.471 --> 01:40:20.144
Understood.

01:40:21.599 --> 01:40:24.728
Sir, Olmedo's gunships, 30 miles out.

01:40:25.144 --> 01:40:27.613
All right. Let's move outta here.

01:40:32.944 --> 01:40:35.163
Major Anderson, let's go.

01:40:56.634 --> 01:40:58.136
Wild Card,

01:40:58.386 --> 01:41:00.480
where the hell are you now?

01:41:02.974 --> 01:41:04.647
About a mile north of the village.

01:41:04.934 --> 01:41:06.752
You're coming toward me now.

01:41:06.852 --> 01:41:09.338
Looks like a green carpet down there.

01:41:09.438 --> 01:41:11.440
I can't see a damn thing.

01:41:12.525 --> 01:41:13.617
You're near me.

01:41:14.235 --> 01:41:15.828
You're above me now.

01:41:16.195 --> 01:41:18.914
Drop two harnesses. I've got Cota.

01:41:20.783 --> 01:41:22.000
Drop 'em.

01:41:28.332 --> 01:41:32.007
Sir, radar reports gunships
20 miles out and closing.

01:41:35.715 --> 01:41:38.184
Always the hard way, huh?

01:41:54.817 --> 01:41:58.071
- Stop. You might hit Ramon.
- Wild Card.

01:41:58.946 --> 01:42:00.619
What's going on?

01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:04.794
Pull us up. Pull us up.

01:42:17.757 --> 01:42:20.135
Oh, shit. We're hit. We're hit.

01:42:20.259 --> 01:42:23.354
Climb. Climb. Get us outta here.

01:42:53.334 --> 01:42:54.756
There they are. Quick.

01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:57.509
Kill him. Cut the rope.

01:43:00.049 --> 01:43:02.393
Cut the rope. Cut the rope.

01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:10.609
Stabilize this goddamn thing.

01:43:18.734 --> 01:43:21.387
Sergeant, cut the rope. Cut the rope.

01:43:21.487 --> 01:43:23.865
Over here. Hurry up. Cut the rope.

01:43:25.491 --> 01:43:27.368
Pull 'em up. Pull 'em up.

01:43:34.667 --> 01:43:36.340
Shit.

01:43:43.175 --> 01:43:45.036
Eagle's Nest to Eagle One.

01:43:45.136 --> 01:43:47.747
We're now in position
12 miles off the coast.

01:43:47.847 --> 01:43:51.977
The gunships are three miles from
your position. We're ready and waiting.

01:43:52.393 --> 01:43:54.487
Gunships three miles out, sir.

01:43:55.479 --> 01:43:57.573
All right. Head out to sea.

01:44:05.823 --> 01:44:07.325
You son of a bitch.

01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:09.793
You're dead.

01:44:10.327 --> 01:44:13.456
You remember your friend
and his beautiful wife?

01:44:13.998 --> 01:44:17.172
I think I'll kill you personally,
like I did them.

01:44:17.460 --> 01:44:22.466
Because you know I'm gonna walk
out of that court, just like I did before.

01:44:22.590 --> 01:44:27.745
And I think I'll double the shipments
of cocaine to America next year.

01:44:27.845 --> 01:44:31.999
And then again a year after that,
until the cocaine flows like a river

01:44:32.099 --> 01:44:34.193
in your pathetic country.

01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:36.688
And your government can't stop it.

01:44:36.854 --> 01:44:40.341
You see, cocaine can buy
anything and anybody

01:44:40.441 --> 01:44:42.885
at any time that I want.

01:44:42.985 --> 01:44:45.454
You think so? Guess what.

01:44:51.994 --> 01:44:53.496
Not today, asshole.
