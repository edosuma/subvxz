00:01.819 --> 00:04.381
It's OK. Mum's here.

00:04.501 --> 00:06.385
Sorry for your loss.

00:06.505 --> 00:08.559
Everyone handles grief differently.

00:08.679 --> 00:12.019
And getting pissed and moving
back in with her ex is her's?

00:12.473 --> 00:14.289
Oh...

00:14.982 --> 00:18.385
I want to be with you.
I want to marry you.

00:18.505 --> 00:19.336
Prove it.

00:19.456 --> 00:21.224
That's my house, you old bitch!

00:21.333 --> 00:24.097
I am not having a stag do.

00:24.217 --> 00:25.939
Bastards!

00:26.059 --> 00:28.057
Fra-a-ank!

00:34.493 --> 00:38.492
Anyone watching, thinking we know
fuck all about knowing fuck all

00:38.533 --> 00:41.492
about owt, needs to watch their back.

00:41.493 --> 00:44.612
So you've had your Labour, 
reclassifying skunk,

00:44.613 --> 00:48.612
sending prices sky-high, literally -
literally - taking the grass

00:48.733 --> 00:50.932
from its own roots!

00:50.933 --> 00:53.092
And now you've got your ConDemNation.

00:53.093 --> 00:56.492
Liberals noshing Tories like
altar boys picking dimps up!

00:56.493 --> 01:00.492
Have we had a national
fucking stroke, or what?

01:00.853 --> 01:03.252
Is revolution a word or was it never?

01:03.253 --> 01:07.252
Anybody watching needs to know, 
we cope better than average

01:08.373 --> 01:10.012
with irony in Chatsworth.

01:10.013 --> 01:13.012
Well, for fuck's sake
we live in Manchester

01:13.013 --> 01:16.252
and they charge us for water.

01:16.253 --> 01:20.252
I wandered lonely as a clown, 
necking mushrooms rarely found.

01:21.053 --> 01:24.772
This green and pleasant
land in ancient times.

01:24.773 --> 01:27.372
Yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak!

01:27.373 --> 01:30.652
It's not theirs any more!

01:30.653 --> 01:33.092
This is our England now.

01:33.093 --> 01:37.092
Pa-a-arty!

01:39.133 --> 01:42.652
(ALL) Ring a ring o' roses
A pocket full of posies...

01:42.653 --> 01:45.812
Atishoo! Atishoo!
We all fall down...

01:45.813 --> 01:49.812
'Each, and every one of us is a dot.
We're all tiny insignificant dots

01:49.813 --> 01:52.652
'scabs and spots on the face
of the planet.

01:52.653 --> 01:55.412
'And we're only here
for the blink of an eye.

01:55.413 --> 01:59.412
'What we do in that blink is so
important, not just for ourselves,

02:00.173 --> 02:02.212
'but for others too.

02:02.213 --> 02:04.452
'For our friends
and for our families.

02:04.453 --> 02:08.332
'We have to leave something behind, 
some trace that we were here.

02:08.333 --> 02:12.332
'Like an astronaut leaves their
footprint on the moon - evidence.

02:12.853 --> 02:14.572
'Because if we don't,

02:14.573 --> 02:18.572
'if we leave no trace, then it's
like we never existed at all.

02:18.653 --> 02:21.212
'Like we did nothing with our life.

02:21.213 --> 02:24.572
'And if that thought hits you
when you're croaking your last,

02:24.573 --> 02:28.372
'in that split second before
the lights finally go out,

02:28.373 --> 02:31.692
'what happens if you realise
you did nothing with your life?

02:31.693 --> 02:34.612
'You helped no-one, 
fought for nothing, changed nothing.

02:34.613 --> 02:38.092
'What do you do at that moment?
Do you live or do you die?'

02:38.093 --> 02:40.372
BEEPING

02:40.373 --> 02:43.012
Mam!

02:43.013 --> 02:47.012
What the fuck is going on?

02:49.533 --> 02:51.492
You'll be home before you know it.

02:51.493 --> 02:53.292
As long as you take things easy.

02:53.293 --> 02:54.732
Think you should take a back seat.

02:54.733 --> 02:58.732
One of us'll look after things, 
till you're back on your feet.

02:59.693 --> 03:03.692
Yeah. OK. Will you do it?

03:05.453 --> 03:06.492
Me?

03:06.493 --> 03:10.292
Mickey's looking after Cilla and
Jamie's got his hands full

03:10.293 --> 03:14.292
trying to get Connor back.

03:21.853 --> 03:25.092
Shane's not up to
running things, Mam.

03:25.093 --> 03:29.092
Sort your son out first, 
then we'll talk business.

03:31.493 --> 03:33.372
Libby Croker.

03:33.373 --> 03:35.052
Croker!

03:35.053 --> 03:38.092
Yeah, I'm calling to see
if my partner Frank Gallagher

03:38.093 --> 03:39.932
has been admitted?

03:39.933 --> 03:42.092
If my partner has been admitted!

03:42.093 --> 03:44.852
Oh, no, please don't transfer me.

03:44.853 --> 03:46.732
Has someone been using my toothbrush?

03:46.733 --> 03:47.492
Why? Gonna start charging?

03:47.493 --> 03:49.852
Why? Gonna start charging?
Shut up! Both of you!

03:49.853 --> 03:53.812
I wondered when the old Libby temper
would raise its ugly head.

03:53.813 --> 03:55.132
Yes, hello. Yes?

03:55.133 --> 03:58.012
I should've come down harder on her
when she was a teenager.

03:58.013 --> 04:00.252
He has long hair and a beard.

04:00.253 --> 04:01.492
Like Gandalf on acid.

04:01.493 --> 04:02.212
Just look where it's got me...

04:02.213 --> 04:04.412
He's 51, but probably
looks a bit older.

04:04.413 --> 04:07.292
You'd think there'd be a modicum
of respect for the poor woman

04:07.293 --> 04:08.172
who brought her into this world.

04:08.173 --> 04:09.452
OK.

04:09.453 --> 04:12.172
Thank you for your time.

04:12.173 --> 04:15.052
You're wasting everyone's time.

04:15.053 --> 04:19.052
He's not coming back and you're
the only one who's bothered.

04:32.813 --> 04:36.812
Fucking hell!

04:40.693 --> 04:44.692
I'm alive... S'good, I suppose.

04:51.013 --> 04:55.012
Not as good looking this time.
Could do with a shave. Lines, veins.

04:58.893 --> 05:00.012
Older!

05:00.013 --> 05:03.172
Old... Old...

05:03.173 --> 05:07.172
Older... Older...

05:19.173 --> 05:21.252
What the fuck am I doing here?!

05:21.253 --> 05:24.292
And where is here? Get back?

05:24.293 --> 05:25.372
Back where?

05:25.373 --> 05:28.732
(ECHOING) Doctor! Doctor!

05:28.733 --> 05:32.612
Doctor! Quick, Doctor, do something.

05:32.613 --> 05:36.612
The Cidermen are coming!

05:43.773 --> 05:45.412
(CRIES OUT)

05:45.413 --> 05:49.412
Wait for me!

06:00.173 --> 06:02.652
Hang on, hang on.

06:02.653 --> 06:06.652
Fucking 'ell, this is a
young man's game. I'm fucked.

06:07.533 --> 06:09.572
Where are we going?

06:09.573 --> 06:11.692
How the fuck would I know?

06:11.693 --> 06:14.772
You're the Doctor.

06:14.773 --> 06:16.692
And who the fuck are you?!

06:16.693 --> 06:19.332
How the fuck did I get here?

06:19.333 --> 06:21.972
I was drinking, there was drugs.

06:21.973 --> 06:25.972
Y'know, the usual day...night.

06:26.213 --> 06:30.212
It was night time... A night out.
It was a stag night!

06:31.333 --> 06:35.332
Frank! Help me!

06:35.973 --> 06:37.892
I need to get back.

06:37.893 --> 06:40.332
It's a trap, Doctor!

06:40.333 --> 06:43.852
Frank!

06:43.853 --> 06:45.092
(SCREAMS)

06:45.093 --> 06:45.652
(SCREAMS)

06:45.653 --> 06:49.652
(SCREAMS)
(SCREAMS)

06:58.493 --> 07:02.492
Come on!

07:24.493 --> 07:25.652
Hiya.

07:25.653 --> 07:27.332
Like a bad penny.

07:27.333 --> 07:29.092
Oh, don't be mean.

07:29.093 --> 07:30.972
I was about to come
and find you.

07:30.973 --> 07:33.092
Who's dead now? Fiona?

07:33.093 --> 07:37.092
I heard a whisper
that Frank's missing.

07:37.133 --> 07:41.132
Don't know where you heard that.

07:43.773 --> 07:46.012
If Frank is missing, that means
there's no-one here

07:46.013 --> 07:47.092
to look after the kids.

07:47.093 --> 07:49.012
I'm here.

07:49.013 --> 07:51.772
But you haven't got
parental responsibility.

07:51.773 --> 07:55.532
You're not really allowed to look
after them. Not legally.

07:55.533 --> 07:56.572
Legality's never bothered you!

07:56.573 --> 08:00.212
Well, it does now.
Liam and Stella are my babies

08:00.213 --> 08:04.212
and they should be with me, 
with their mum.

08:07.573 --> 08:09.492
Ooh!

08:09.493 --> 08:12.492
I told you we had to play
the long game, didn't I?

08:12.493 --> 08:15.892
We'd have been waiting longer if it
weren't for fags and chips.

08:15.893 --> 08:18.572
Thank God for heart attacks, eh?

08:18.573 --> 08:22.572
I can say that, cos she's
gonna be all right, in't she?

08:23.613 --> 08:26.372
Yeah. A couple of days, 
she'll be back home.

08:26.373 --> 08:28.732
There you go then.
Heart attacks!

08:28.733 --> 08:32.732
Heart attacks!

08:38.053 --> 08:42.052
Listen. I've got a job on.
I can count on you, can't I?

08:42.413 --> 08:44.251
Yeah.

08:44.253 --> 08:46.532
PERSON YELPING

08:46.533 --> 08:48.252
What in God's name...

08:48.253 --> 08:52.252
SCREAMING

08:57.653 --> 09:01.012
YELPING CONTINUES

09:01.013 --> 09:02.252
Help!

09:02.253 --> 09:06.252
Someone call the police! Help!

09:07.413 --> 09:08.852
What's going on?

09:08.853 --> 09:10.292
Did you get a good look at them?

09:10.293 --> 09:11.412
At who?

09:11.413 --> 09:12.372
Your attackers.

09:12.373 --> 09:16.372
The attackers are in...

09:18.573 --> 09:22.572
Filth!

09:25.373 --> 09:29.372
Back upstairs, bitch!

09:33.253 --> 09:37.252
Time to play with the big boys
again. 40 grand's worth of coke,

09:37.373 --> 09:39.652
two quid's worth of baking soda
equals 80 grand.

09:39.653 --> 09:42.132
Where did you get 40 grand's worth
of coke?

09:42.133 --> 09:45.292
I deferred payment. These suckers
turn up with a bag of cash.

09:45.293 --> 09:47.572
40 for the suppliers, 
40 for us. Easy money.

09:47.573 --> 09:48.612
Yeah, too easy.

09:48.613 --> 09:52.492
How do you know this ain't a set up?
Couldn't have picked a worse place.

09:52.493 --> 09:56.492
Public, cars, CCTV.

09:57.213 --> 09:59.252
CAR HORN PLAYS TUNE

09:59.253 --> 10:02.292
Well, this just gets better
and better.

10:02.293 --> 10:06.292
Oh, wait in the car, will you?

10:24.213 --> 10:26.412
Everything all right, mate?

10:26.413 --> 10:30.412
Yeah. Top.

10:35.413 --> 10:37.132
You OK?

10:37.133 --> 10:39.532
Why wouldn't I be?

10:39.533 --> 10:42.852
I thought you'd be a
bit happier, that's all.

10:42.853 --> 10:45.172
First big deal.
Should be celebrating.

10:45.173 --> 10:49.012
Yeah, great. Let's have a big
fuck-off party, shall we?

10:49.013 --> 10:53.012
Fuck off!

11:04.653 --> 11:05.812
Fuck's this?!

11:05.813 --> 11:09.812
Don't want any trouble, do we now?

11:16.733 --> 11:20.732
Just about to bring it in.

11:25.453 --> 11:28.812
She might have good intentions.
She's got this money coming her way.

11:28.813 --> 11:30.012
That's nothing.

11:30.013 --> 11:32.252
18 grand's hardly nothing, Carl.

11:32.253 --> 11:34.772
It is to her. Won't last two minutes.

11:34.773 --> 11:35.892
Ooh, thanks a bunch.

11:35.893 --> 11:38.372
You can't just pick your kids up
and drop 'em off when you want.

11:38.373 --> 11:41.652
And you can't tell me what to do, 
cos you're not me dad!

11:41.653 --> 11:44.492
Libby's a million times a better mum
than you.

11:44.493 --> 11:46.772
You're not taking
Liam and Stella away.

11:46.773 --> 11:50.332
Look, there's nothing any of you can
do to stop me. It's the law!

11:50.333 --> 11:52.732
She's right.

11:52.733 --> 11:55.012
Uh-uh, hold your horses.

11:55.013 --> 11:56.652
Not yet, sweetheart.

11:56.653 --> 12:00.252
I've got a lesbian wedding
to go to in the Lakes.

12:00.253 --> 12:02.692
They're gonna tie a ribbon
around a pebble

12:02.693 --> 12:04.652
and then chuck it into
the Windermere.

12:04.653 --> 12:07.812
Then set off those paper lanterns.
Should be beautiful.

12:07.813 --> 12:10.692
I love a good wedding, don't you?

12:10.693 --> 12:14.692
I'll be back in a couple of days.
If you could have their stuff packed

12:15.773 --> 12:17.932
that'll save time and that.

12:17.933 --> 12:21.932
See ya. (CLICKS TONGUE)

12:23.013 --> 12:27.012
We have got to find your father.

12:30.053 --> 12:33.412
I'm going to hand my notice in
at Lillian's.

12:33.413 --> 12:37.412
I'm married to the head of a family
now, Capo di tutti capi.

12:38.413 --> 12:41.412
I'm Carmela Soprano and
I shouldn't be blowing fat,

12:41.413 --> 12:45.412
sweaty blokes for 30 quid a throw, 
when I could be helping you.

12:46.013 --> 12:50.012
What do you reckon?

12:50.733 --> 12:54.732
Surprise!

13:01.213 --> 13:03.412
Why didn't you tell us
you was coming home, Mum?

13:03.413 --> 13:07.372
Jamie wanted to surprise you all.
Been filling me in on the business.

13:07.373 --> 13:08.892
Doing good, eh, son?

13:08.893 --> 13:12.892
Yeah, I thought it was a good time
to expand. Build on what we have.

13:13.333 --> 13:16.372
Fucking hell, 
it's not The Apprentice.

13:16.373 --> 13:18.772
Feast your eyes on that.

13:18.773 --> 13:22.772
All Shane's work, the planning, 
the execution.

13:30.733 --> 13:32.936
Good work, son.

13:46.553 --> 13:47.673
You called?

13:47.793 --> 13:49.352
There wasn't a single
penny in that bag...

13:49.353 --> 13:52.552
You brought Mum home, put on that
big fucking performance and...

13:52.553 --> 13:54.072
You're not up to running
the business, Shane.

13:54.073 --> 13:57.272
Bollocks! This is about
you not being the boss.

13:57.273 --> 13:59.192
It's about the business
and the family.

13:59.193 --> 14:00.912
I don't want everything
we've worked for pissed away.

14:00.913 --> 14:02.912
Neither do I.

14:02.913 --> 14:03.832
Where did you get the money?

14:03.833 --> 14:05.552
Fuck all to do with you.

14:05.553 --> 14:09.112
It is if you're putting
the family at risk.

14:09.113 --> 14:11.432
A small-time loan shark.

14:11.433 --> 14:15.432
Who?

14:21.353 --> 14:22.952
Chemical Mitch.

14:22.953 --> 14:25.472
Fucking hell, Shane!

14:25.473 --> 14:29.192
I'm sorting it, all right?

14:29.193 --> 14:31.312
Laters.

14:31.313 --> 14:35.312
You forgotten something?

14:37.153 --> 14:38.432
Not that. Your sister!

14:38.433 --> 14:42.432
I thought you'd enrolled in
college doing childcare shite.

14:43.353 --> 14:46.072
A childcare and development course.
Only cos they had a free creche.

14:46.073 --> 14:47.672
I thought with you being home...

14:47.673 --> 14:51.672
You thought I'd just waltz back in
and pick up right where I left off?

14:51.673 --> 14:53.752
I've got me Turkish wrestling...

14:53.753 --> 14:57.192
I'm fucking convalescing, son!

14:57.193 --> 15:00.072
I stared death in the face.

15:00.073 --> 15:04.072
I need rest and time to build me
strength back up.

15:05.113 --> 15:09.112
God knows, if I don't, I'll...

15:10.113 --> 15:12.312
Don't you worry, Mum.

15:12.313 --> 15:15.992
I'm gonna be the best carer
that Cilla could ever wish for.

15:15.993 --> 15:19.992
You get some rest.

15:25.473 --> 15:28.592
Backed up by researchers
into child development.

15:28.593 --> 15:32.592
The closer the mother - or father -

15:33.553 --> 15:37.552
they are to baby, it creates
a stronger and deeper bond, yeah?

15:39.753 --> 15:43.752
I spent a year in Africa
working with mothers and babies

15:44.433 --> 15:48.432
and it's really surprising to us
as Westerners,

15:49.193 --> 15:53.192
but these mothers, they carry their
children with them at all times.

15:53.713 --> 15:56.792
Well, not that surprising, 
though, is it?

15:56.793 --> 16:00.792
They haven't got a choice.
They haven't got anything, have they?

16:01.433 --> 16:05.432
No prams or bouncy chairs, 
no shelves and that.

16:06.353 --> 16:07.752
Shelves?

16:07.753 --> 16:10.472
Yeah, you know, to stick
the baby on for a bit.

16:10.473 --> 16:14.152
Right.

16:14.153 --> 16:16.472
OK.

16:16.473 --> 16:17.672
I'm hearing you.

16:17.673 --> 16:19.392
"I hear you say."

16:19.393 --> 16:21.272
That's right, innit?

16:21.273 --> 16:23.312
OK.

16:23.313 --> 16:27.312
I hear you say you think I'm unfit
to be the mother of your child.

16:27.513 --> 16:31.432
I fucking disagree.
I totally fucking disagree!

16:31.433 --> 16:32.592
OK.

16:32.593 --> 16:35.512
I haven't finished! I think I
am fit to be a mother, because

16:35.513 --> 16:37.112
I'm trying to protect Connor, which
is why I don't want you to see him.

16:37.113 --> 16:40.152
Bollocks!

16:40.153 --> 16:44.152
Sorry, sorry.

16:45.313 --> 16:47.312
I don't trust you, Jamie.

16:47.313 --> 16:49.192
What do you think I'm gonna do?

16:49.193 --> 16:50.192
Do a runner with Connor.

16:50.193 --> 16:51.712
I wouldn't do that.

16:51.713 --> 16:52.752
I hear you say...

16:52.753 --> 16:56.752
I hear you say you're not letting him see
me because you think I'm gonna do a runner!

16:57.433 --> 17:00.672
But I say I thought that's why
you're unfit to be a mother.

17:00.673 --> 17:02.192
You're not allowing him to see
his dad.

17:02.193 --> 17:06.192
I don't give a fuck who's blood
he's got, mine, Joe's, whoever.

17:07.553 --> 17:11.551
I'm his dad. I'm his fucking dad!

17:16.953 --> 17:18.992
Oh, come in, why don't you?

17:18.992 --> 17:20.512
You've called the council!

17:20.512 --> 17:24.512
What makes you think it was me?

17:26.153 --> 17:29.832
So what if I did? You drove me
to it with the noise of your...

17:29.833 --> 17:32.032
fornicating!

17:32.033 --> 17:34.712
Jackson's a trainee teacher.
If you make official complaints,

17:34.713 --> 17:35.992
you'll cause a lot of problems.

17:35.993 --> 17:37.032
For?

17:37.033 --> 17:38.592
Us. Jackson could lose his job.

17:38.593 --> 17:42.232
And we could lose our home.

17:42.233 --> 17:44.872
We had a noise abatement notice
at our last address.

17:44.873 --> 17:47.152
Last three addresses.

17:47.153 --> 17:51.152
So if I make a complaint, 
backed up with evidence,

17:51.473 --> 17:54.272
you could lose your job...

17:54.273 --> 17:58.272
and your home?

18:11.953 --> 18:14.312
Shane's decided to up the interest
on everything we're owed.

18:14.313 --> 18:17.232
He has to pay this money
back somehow.

18:17.233 --> 18:20.352
The people that owe us money are
skint! They can't afford to stump up

18:20.353 --> 18:23.152
any more, 
so they'll turn to other crews.

18:23.153 --> 18:25.752
We won't have a business left.

18:25.753 --> 18:27.752
OK. So what about this loan shark?

18:27.753 --> 18:30.552
Chemical Mitch.

18:30.553 --> 18:32.592
Known for throwing
acid and bleach around...

18:32.593 --> 18:36.592
not just at his enemies, but their
wives, girlfriends, mothers.

18:38.193 --> 18:41.952
A right nasty little fuck.

18:41.953 --> 18:45.872
Don't think anyone
would miss him, do you?

18:45.873 --> 18:48.672
Shane won't do it.

18:48.673 --> 18:51.832
Like I said, 
he's not up to running things.

18:51.833 --> 18:52.432
He thinks he is.

18:52.433 --> 18:56.272
He thinks he is. He's not! He's fucking things up.
And if he carries on like this,

18:56.273 --> 19:00.272
we're gonna lose the business, 
or someone's going to get hurt.

19:03.153 --> 19:05.552
OK. You're in charge.

19:05.553 --> 19:08.592
Take over and sort it out.

19:08.593 --> 19:11.472
But don't tell Shane.
You'll break his heart.

19:11.473 --> 19:14.552
He's never been top
at anything in his life.

19:14.553 --> 19:17.792
When he was a kid and they were
picking teams, he was always last,

19:17.793 --> 19:20.712
even when his own fucking
brother was choosing.

19:20.713 --> 19:23.272
Show him.
Do whatever it takes to make him

19:23.273 --> 19:27.272
realise he's not up to running the
show, for the good of the family.

19:32.953 --> 19:36.712
Maguire? Shaney, Shaney...

19:36.713 --> 19:40.712
Your idea's smart, get other people
to pay for your fuck ups. I like it.

19:42.233 --> 19:44.672
I like it that much, 
I'm going to do the same.

19:44.673 --> 19:48.352
Your debt's just gone up five grand.

19:48.353 --> 19:52.352
Come on, girls.

20:08.313 --> 20:12.072
Had to fight a dwarf for it.
But don't worry, he'll be fine.

20:12.073 --> 20:13.112
Shh!

20:13.113 --> 20:14.912
Tomorrow's another day.

20:23.353 --> 20:24.312
I can't breathe!

20:24.313 --> 20:25.232
I can't breathe!
Sorry!

20:25.233 --> 20:27.632
I can't breathe! Sorry!
No, no, don't stop!

20:27.633 --> 20:29.352
(YELPS LOUDLY)

20:29.353 --> 20:31.632
I can't...it's too good!

20:31.633 --> 20:34.192
Don't stop! Fuck me!

20:34.193 --> 20:38.192
Fuck me. Fuck me!

20:42.273 --> 20:46.072
Frank? What? What is it?

20:46.073 --> 20:47.872
I went to the post office, right?

20:47.873 --> 20:50.032
He's drawn his benefits!

20:50.033 --> 20:54.032
So he's alive and...

20:54.553 --> 20:57.672
And he's not here.

20:57.673 --> 21:00.152
Well, yeah.

21:00.153 --> 21:02.472
'Go on...fuck me, 
fuck me, ahh!'

21:02.473 --> 21:04.272
Aah! Aah!

21:04.273 --> 21:06.632
I wonder why?

21:06.633 --> 21:08.112
Why do you think?

21:08.113 --> 21:10.672
He doesn't want to marry me.

21:10.673 --> 21:12.472
Ye-e-e-e-e-eah!

21:12.473 --> 21:14.338
Yes!

21:17.993 --> 21:21.192
So Lillian says, 
"You're gonna have to work out your

21:21.193 --> 21:24.712
"notice if you want a reference", 
so I turned round to her and says,

21:24.713 --> 21:28.712
"Lillian, love, I'm getting
out of this game altogether."

21:29.473 --> 21:30.672
You left?

21:30.673 --> 21:33.552
Not till next Friday.

21:33.553 --> 21:36.752
It'll be all right.

21:36.753 --> 21:38.752
Won't it? I mean,

21:38.753 --> 21:40.192
I know I'll be paying Chemical
Mitch interest...

21:40.193 --> 21:43.432
Give over fretting, will you?

21:43.433 --> 21:47.432
This is Jamie's doing, this.
Give us a pull on that.

21:49.473 --> 21:52.632
Thing is, 
he's dead fucked off, cos you're

21:52.633 --> 21:55.752
doing a good job and he's trying
to mess with your head, that's all.

21:55.753 --> 21:58.872
If he were brilliant, your mum would
have made him boss, wouldn't she?

21:58.873 --> 22:01.592
But she didn't.
Who did she choose? You!

22:01.593 --> 22:04.352
Why? Because you're
a fucking genius, that's why.

22:04.353 --> 22:08.352
You're Tony fucking Soprano, eh?

22:11.313 --> 22:14.872
Anyone else remember
the means their parents resorted to

22:14.873 --> 22:16.232
in the names of discipline?

22:16.233 --> 22:20.232
Please!

22:20.233 --> 22:24.232
We had to lick batteries.

22:28.633 --> 22:32.632
PP3s for, like, small stuff.
But for bigger crimes, like nicking

22:33.113 --> 22:36.392
stuff what we shouldn't have nicked, 
we had to lick a fat one.

22:36.393 --> 22:40.392
PP9s and car batteries
for really big shit.

22:40.713 --> 22:43.512
You're not seriously proposing
this as a punishment for a child?

22:43.513 --> 22:46.552
God, no. No. Our mam did it
to us when we was kids,

22:46.553 --> 22:48.712
but things have moved on, 
haven't they?

22:48.713 --> 22:52.712
I wouldn't harm a hair
on a kid's head, me.

22:54.033 --> 22:56.312
And me, a disabled pensioner!

22:56.313 --> 23:00.312
Walked right into my home, 
issuing threats, it's so upsetting.

23:00.433 --> 23:04.432
Sadly, I don't have any hard evidence
of their threatening behaviour,

23:05.553 --> 23:09.552
but maybe when you hear this, 
you'll appreciate

23:09.633 --> 23:13.632
what I've had to endure
since they moved in.

23:14.793 --> 23:18.792
MUSIC: "Poker Face" by Lady Gaga

23:28.793 --> 23:32.792
MUSIC CONTINUES

23:36.313 --> 23:38.632
We could say he's back, 
say he's in here.

23:38.633 --> 23:40.112
We can't just give up.

23:40.113 --> 23:43.192
I'm not giving up. All we can do now
is act dignified, not cause a scene.

23:43.193 --> 23:44.992
For Liam and Stella's sake.

23:44.993 --> 23:46.992
Fuck that.

23:46.993 --> 23:49.787
Have they chucked you
out of college yet?

23:49.907 --> 23:51.114
Have they?

23:51.234 --> 23:54.472
I'm studying, right?
I have to develop strategies

23:54.473 --> 23:55.935
on dealing with problem kids.

23:56.180 --> 23:57.088
Have you tried...?

23:57.208 --> 23:59.052
That doesn't involve
licking batteries.

24:02.537 --> 24:06.324
Rum. My attempt to build a bridge.

24:06.673 --> 24:10.147
I've let myself get carried away
with my own pettiness.

24:10.267 --> 24:12.942
You're decent people, 
and I really don't want to

24:13.014 --> 24:17.013
cause you any problems
or have any friction between us.

24:21.268 --> 24:22.817
That's very kind.

24:24.094 --> 24:25.982
New beginnings?

24:32.254 --> 24:34.224
I hope you'll be happy in it.

24:37.320 --> 24:41.622
Libby... I heard about Frank
and the wedding and that.

24:41.742 --> 24:46.213
I know what you're going through, 
cos it happened to me. I'm sorry.

24:46.654 --> 24:48.554
Thank you.

24:53.186 --> 24:56.533
I did some snooping around.
Those Welsh blokes

24:56.534 --> 24:59.213
and Chemical Mitch, 
they're one and the same.

24:59.214 --> 25:00.591
Chemical Mitch isn't Welsh.

25:00.711 --> 25:04.413
No, the Welsh blokes work for Mitch.
Trust me.

25:04.414 --> 25:07.213
They rip you off, 
Mitch steps in to lend you money.

25:07.214 --> 25:10.013
You've been stung twice
by the same outfit.

25:10.014 --> 25:12.013
Nobody will think any less
of you if you want to step down.

25:12.014 --> 25:14.213
Nah. I'll sort it.

25:14.214 --> 25:15.973
Maguire?

25:15.974 --> 25:19.173
Mitch wants his five grand. Now.

25:19.174 --> 25:22.093
I'll pay him what we agreed
when I get it, all right?

25:22.094 --> 25:23.373
Tell Mitch he can fuck off.

25:23.374 --> 25:24.413
Stay out of it, Jamie.

25:24.414 --> 25:26.826
Jamie? Nice pub.

25:43.706 --> 25:45.478
Must've proper lamped you one.

25:45.479 --> 25:45.918
Ah! F...

25:45.919 --> 25:46.958
Sorry.

25:46.959 --> 25:49.380
Look I'm fine, cheers, everyone.

Listen. I'm in the boot of a car.

26:03.359 --> 26:05.998
We're stopping. Fucking hell!

26:05.999 --> 26:07.357

Just...

26:09.537 --> 26:12.318
Listen. Help me, please!

26:12.319 --> 26:14.198
I'm going to find out what's what,

26:14.199 --> 26:16.958
where you are, and I'll be
with you before you know it.

26:16.959 --> 26:19.678
Just hang in there.

26:19.679 --> 26:22.238
Make sure everyone gets a drink.

26:22.239 --> 26:23.941

I'll kill him for this.

27:21.964 --> 27:23.358
No.

27:23.359 --> 27:24.922
I will.

27:38.919 --> 27:39.958
What's the matter?

Nothing. Don't stop, please.

Jackson?

Is there something going on?

27:55.802 --> 27:58.041
It's never happened before.

27:58.042 --> 27:58.841
I know.

27:58.961 --> 28:01.493
You can usually hang a towel off it.

28:01.795 --> 28:03.641
Let's not make a big deal of it.

28:03.642 --> 28:06.300
Don't want it to become an issue.

28:07.202 --> 28:11.201
Just relax.
I'll do all the work, yeah?

28:18.363 --> 28:21.750
Just relax.

28:49.442 --> 28:53.441
Please stop!

28:53.561 --> 28:58.001
I think it's bleeding.

28:58.242 --> 29:01.201
(HUMS)

29:01.202 --> 29:05.201
DOOR CLOSING

29:05.682 --> 29:06.721
Good morning.

29:06.722 --> 29:10.721
SEXUAL MOANING

29:14.802 --> 29:15.841
Oh!

29:15.842 --> 29:17.681
Ah! Ah!

29:17.682 --> 29:20.201
Ah! Ah!

RADIO PLAYS MUSIC

29:22.642 --> 29:25.361
Oh! Oh! Oh!

29:25.362 --> 29:29.361
MOANING AND BANGING STILL AUDIBLE

29:29.482 --> 29:31.201
Ah! Ah! Ah!

29:31.202 --> 29:32.641
RADIO VOLUME INCREASES

29:32.642 --> 29:34.401
Oh!

29:34.402 --> 29:36.561
Ah!

29:36.681 --> 29:41.002
I died five times, literally died,

29:41.122 --> 29:43.241
five times.

29:43.242 --> 29:45.801
I walked along the tunnel
to the bright light.

29:45.802 --> 29:48.361
You'll never guess who I met there.

29:48.362 --> 29:49.681
Sidney Poitier.

29:49.682 --> 29:53.401
Sidney Poitier appeared
as the manifestation

29:53.402 --> 29:54.681
of our Lord and saviour,

29:54.682 --> 29:58.161
Jesus Christ, 
and he spake unto me,

29:58.491 --> 30:04.601
me alone, and he said, "Mimi
Maguire, it's not your time yet,

30:04.721 --> 30:08.841
"go back, go back and tell Karen
she should let Jamie see his son."

30:09.244 --> 30:13.601
Not my words, 
the words of our Lord Jesus Christ.

30:16.322 --> 30:17.841
Is that the time?

30:17.842 --> 30:21.001
Thanks for coming. Means the world.

30:21.002 --> 30:23.833
Karen? Jamie is the father, 
isn't he?

30:25.282 --> 30:27.054
Who's Cilla's father?

30:30.082 --> 30:32.321
I've told Jamie to sort it out
with you,

30:32.322 --> 30:34.280
I know it's tricky with Joe
and that.

30:42.402 --> 30:43.481
Thanks.

30:43.482 --> 30:45.138
Cheers.

30:49.962 --> 30:52.721
If this is the bit where
I'm supposed to say I'm sorry,

30:52.722 --> 30:54.241
that I went too far, etc, etc,

30:54.242 --> 30:55.721
you're wrong.

30:55.722 --> 30:56.841
You're angry.

30:56.842 --> 30:58.271
I understand that.

30:59.562 --> 31:03.561
I know what I've done is...

31:03.802 --> 31:07.801
I just want us to move forward, 
somehow, you, me and Connor.

31:09.682 --> 31:13.681
And what if Joe decides
to come back?

31:13.962 --> 31:15.201
He's not coming back.

31:15.202 --> 31:19.201
Ever.

31:23.202 --> 31:24.364
He's dead.

31:27.241 --> 31:29.198
How?

31:32.162 --> 31:34.001
So that's why you've come back, 
is it,

31:34.025 --> 31:35.336
because you don't have a choice
any more?

31:35.456 --> 31:37.041
I always have a choice, Jamie.

31:37.042 --> 31:39.641
I don't have to be here.

31:39.642 --> 31:44.987
I fucked up, I know what
I threw away, but I wanted out,

31:45.322 --> 31:47.664
and I chose to come back to you.

31:50.282 --> 31:52.401
Now it's up to you.

31:52.402 --> 31:54.872
This is your time to choose.

31:59.322 --> 32:00.561
Eskimos?
Inuits.

32:00.562 --> 32:02.041
Eskimos.
Inuits.

32:02.042 --> 32:03.921
To-mate-oh, tomato. Go on.

32:03.922 --> 32:08.242
I stayed with an Inuit community
last year for several months,

32:08.362 --> 32:13.482
because I wanted to understand
how families bring up children

32:13.602 --> 32:16.681
in a happy, peaceful, loving way

32:16.682 --> 32:20.081
in the midst
of seemingly harsh environments.

32:20.082 --> 32:21.721
And what I actually discovered...

32:21.722 --> 32:23.721
They don't know any different, 
do they?

32:23.722 --> 32:24.601
Eh?

32:24.602 --> 32:28.521
They're not going to cry or moan
for an Xbox or a Wii or whatever,

32:28.522 --> 32:30.561
because they don't know
what they are, do they?

32:30.562 --> 32:33.481
You don't grow up wanting something
that you don't know about.

32:33.482 --> 32:37.481
You grow up happy with the stuff
you've already got, don't you?

32:38.682 --> 32:42.681
Well, yeah, yes.

32:43.522 --> 32:47.521
It's a nice little piece, this, 
from Lithuania.

32:49.602 --> 32:53.001
Couldn't point Lithuania out
on a map, me.

32:53.002 --> 32:57.001
CAR LOCK BLEEPS

32:57.402 --> 33:01.161
You don't have to do this, you know.

33:01.162 --> 33:05.161
Wait a minute.

33:05.242 --> 33:09.241
Softly, softly catches the monkey.

33:10.082 --> 33:14.081
CAR LOCK BLEEPS

33:21.562 --> 33:23.321
I can't do it.

33:23.322 --> 33:26.762
Fuck this!
I knew it, I fucking knew it.

33:26.882 --> 33:27.630
What?

33:27.750 --> 33:29.201
That you'd bottle it.

33:29.202 --> 33:32.045
You're always like this.
You're your own worst enemy.

33:32.324 --> 33:34.803
You've moaned all your life
that something's not fair.

33:34.923 --> 33:37.750
Never get picked for the football team, 
never get the decent jobs,

33:37.870 --> 33:40.799
never ***.

33:42.168 --> 33:44.081
There's got to be some other way.

33:44.082 --> 33:47.196
If you don't stump up the cash he's
going to start fucking us allup.

33:47.743 --> 33:52.041
Not just me, you and Micky, 
but Mam, Kelly, the whole family.

33:55.442 --> 33:57.121
CAR LOCK BLEEPS

33:57.122 --> 33:59.721
He's leaving.

33:59.722 --> 34:03.721
Come on, it's now or never.

34:03.922 --> 34:05.321
Fuck it, I'll do it.

34:05.322 --> 34:07.013
No.

34:12.802 --> 34:13.841
Mitch.

34:13.842 --> 34:16.161
Got something for you.

34:25.121 --> 34:26.161
Shane.

34:30.882 --> 34:33.322
Shane! Shane!

34:33.442 --> 34:35.960
You'll never step up, 
never be a man.

34:35.962 --> 34:37.866
Let big brother do it for ya.

34:37.985 --> 34:40.159
TWO GUNSHOTS

34:44.042 --> 34:44.913
Shane!

34:45.134 --> 34:48.641
GUNSHOT

34:49.893 --> 34:51.434
Finish it.

34:51.554 --> 34:52.958
I fucking can't, man.

34:53.079 --> 34:54.514
Fucking finish it, now!

34:54.635 --> 34:56.409
GUNSHOT

35:07.388 --> 35:10.766
I thought you were going to bottle
it. Didn't think you had it in you.

35:13.979 --> 35:18.482
Is this what you do? Is this what
you have to do when you run things?

35:19.818 --> 35:21.377
It's business Shane,

35:21.378 --> 35:22.817
just business.

35:22.818 --> 35:25.777
Yeah. Well I don't want it.

35:25.778 --> 35:27.137
Not this.

35:27.138 --> 35:29.537
Not like this.

35:29.538 --> 35:31.377
You have it.

35:31.378 --> 35:34.057
You run it.

35:34.058 --> 35:36.417
I don't want to.

35:36.418 --> 35:38.377
Where are you going?

35:38.378 --> 35:40.497
Shane!

35:40.498 --> 35:41.944
Shane!

35:43.876 --> 35:47.577
I've seen Harry and Larry
nicking money out of my purse.

35:47.578 --> 35:48.577
GIGGLING

35:48.578 --> 35:52.577
Well that's what it says, right.
Purse. I haven't got a purse.

35:54.698 --> 35:58.697
When I confront them, they deny it, 
adding lies to their theft.

35:59.058 --> 36:00.657
What do you do?

36:00.658 --> 36:02.857
It's an hard one, this one.

36:02.858 --> 36:05.577
Actually, it's fairly simple.
You challenge them.

36:05.578 --> 36:09.577
You see, a child will build lie
upon lie to create bigger, wilder

36:11.018 --> 36:15.017
lies until the whole web of
lies collapses around them.

36:15.098 --> 36:16.577
Leaving them feeling all humiliated.

36:16.578 --> 36:20.577
And what do you propose, 
Michael? A PP9?

36:20.697 --> 36:21.966
Take them to the shop.

36:22.086 --> 36:23.771
Oh, buy them a treat?

36:23.891 --> 36:26.137
Yeah. Then go to pay for it

36:26.138 --> 36:30.552
and give it a big, 
"Right, I'll just open my purse."

36:31.898 --> 36:34.937
"Oh, no, I haven't got enough money.

36:34.938 --> 36:37.577
"Soz I can't buy it you now."

36:37.578 --> 36:41.577
Cause and effect, innit.
You know consequences and that.

36:43.738 --> 36:47.737
Have you actually got kids?

36:48.898 --> 36:51.017
I have children, yes.

36:51.018 --> 36:54.097
You know, you travel all around
the world, studying how other

36:54.098 --> 36:57.337
people bring up their kids and that.

36:57.338 --> 37:01.337
Bet you hardly spend
any time with your own.

37:02.218 --> 37:06.217
Probably don't even recognise you.

37:23.818 --> 37:26.417
Mrs Croker? Sorry to disturb you.

37:26.418 --> 37:30.177
We, er, we just wanted to apologise

37:30.178 --> 37:32.017
for everything
that's been going on.

37:32.018 --> 37:34.937
It's all got a
little bit out of hand.

37:34.938 --> 37:37.377
Spiking our drinks and...

37:37.378 --> 37:40.537
I don't know what you're
talking about.

37:40.538 --> 37:44.297
We'd really like to put a stop to it.
Turn a page and start again.

37:44.298 --> 37:48.297
And how exactly
do you propose to do that?

37:48.578 --> 37:51.377
We'll look into some kind of
soundproofing on our side.

37:51.378 --> 37:55.377
And as way of an apology.

37:56.418 --> 38:00.417
Oh!

38:02.058 --> 38:05.417
Thank you.

38:05.418 --> 38:09.377
Love is a fecking
wonderful thing, isn't it?

38:09.378 --> 38:13.337
These nature programmes...

38:13.338 --> 38:15.577
..all the animals
mounting each other,

38:15.578 --> 38:19.577
spreading their love.

38:34.858 --> 38:38.857
I feel so...happy!

38:54.858 --> 38:57.857
College finish early today?

38:57.858 --> 39:00.057
Don't need that course any more.

39:00.058 --> 39:02.857
Lecturer was a fraud.
She talked a good talk

39:02.858 --> 39:07.666
in her fancy Scottish accent, 
but she couldn't walk the walk.

39:08.120 --> 39:11.057
I called her on her shit, 
caused a massive revolt.

39:11.138 --> 39:14.937
You should've seen me, Mam.
You'd have been dead proud.

39:14.938 --> 39:17.137
No need to worry about Cilla.

39:17.138 --> 39:19.377
She's in good hands with me.

39:19.378 --> 39:23.377
Where is she?

39:23.378 --> 39:27.377
Shit! I've left her on the bus!

39:33.760 --> 39:38.618
They should call this
Britain's Got No Fecking Talent!

39:38.738 --> 39:41.437
Rain makes the flowers
grow, you know.

39:41.844 --> 39:45.278
It also makes us appreciate the
sun when it finally comes out.

39:48.698 --> 39:52.097
At some point in your life
you'll think all it ever does

39:52.098 --> 39:54.777
is rain and rain, 
but you have to hold out

39:54.778 --> 39:56.857
because there will
be sunshine in the end.

39:56.858 --> 39:58.337
I promise.

39:58.338 --> 40:02.337
Oh, dear.
All a bit sad in here, isn't it?

40:03.718 --> 40:07.417
Anyway, think we've got everything, 
'cept the kids.

40:07.418 --> 40:10.712
Leave her here and I'll come with
you if you just leave her here.

40:10.832 --> 40:11.537
Don't be silly.

40:11.538 --> 40:13.297
Libby's a better mum
than you'll ever be.

40:13.298 --> 40:14.097
Liam!

40:14.098 --> 40:14.991
Liam!
I mean it.

40:15.111 --> 40:19.017
I'm your mum and you're both coming
with me whether you like it or not.

40:19.018 --> 40:21.505
You'll have to drag me
kicking and screaming.

40:21.506 --> 40:23.752
What's to stop me running straight
back here with Stella?

40:24.090 --> 40:27.457
But the council won't give me that bigger
place unless one of you come with me.

40:27.458 --> 40:28.573
The council?

40:28.693 --> 40:30.897
This is about you
getting a bigger house?

40:30.898 --> 40:33.145
It's got two toilets.

40:33.265 --> 40:34.657
Unbelievable!

40:34.658 --> 40:37.430
Oh, get over yourselves.
Come on, Liam.

40:37.550 --> 40:39.060
Stella or me.

40:57.458 --> 40:59.217
You don't have to do this.

40:59.218 --> 41:00.337
I do.

41:00.338 --> 41:04.337
I'll be back as soon
as she gets her house.

41:05.218 --> 41:09.217
Take care of her.

41:14.538 --> 41:18.537
I'll call you as soon
as your dad gets back.

41:23.778 --> 41:27.777
Scatter!

41:55.378 --> 41:55.977
Cheers, mate.

41:55.978 --> 41:57.017
Nice one.

41:57.018 --> 41:58.097
No probs.

41:58.098 --> 42:02.097
Not so hard next time. Later on.

42:05.018 --> 42:06.297
Mate, calm down.

42:06.298 --> 42:07.177
Jamie!

42:07.178 --> 42:08.263
It's going to be all right.

42:14.858 --> 42:17.937
INAUDIBLE

42:17.938 --> 42:21.095
'It's business, Shane.
Just business.'

42:39.538 --> 42:41.388
What's the news with Karen?

42:41.651 --> 42:45.398
It's going to be a long haul, 
but it's good, yeah.

42:47.378 --> 42:50.657
He must've sussed that Chemical
Mitch's boys wanted shot of him.

42:50.658 --> 42:53.257
So he got you to do it?

42:53.258 --> 42:54.817
Probably made up

42:54.818 --> 42:58.057
all that stuff about the Welsh Boys
being in bed with Mitch an' all.

42:58.058 --> 43:01.657
I could kill him!

43:01.658 --> 43:03.537
He did me a favour.

43:03.538 --> 43:05.857
By almost drowning you?!

43:05.858 --> 43:08.217
He was born for this.

43:08.218 --> 43:12.217
Scamming...scheming...killing.

43:12.618 --> 43:15.017
So are you, sweetheart.

43:15.018 --> 43:19.017
Nah. Not killing.

43:19.018 --> 43:21.826
It takes a certain kind
of person to do that.

43:26.578 --> 43:27.697
I'm sorry, Shane.

43:27.698 --> 43:29.257
Hm?

43:29.258 --> 43:32.177
I pushed you, I encouraged you.

43:32.178 --> 43:35.777
I was getting off on the idea
of you being the boss.

43:35.778 --> 43:39.777
And we're happy
as we are, aren't we?

43:44.938 --> 43:48.537
'To taste death no matter how
fleeting means you taste life

43:48.538 --> 43:51.537
'in all its messy sweetness
and fucked up bitterness.

43:51.538 --> 43:54.177
'Death let's you appreciate life.

43:54.178 --> 43:56.217
'Helps you realise
what it's all about

43:56.218 --> 43:59.817
'because at the end of the day, 
when all's said and done,

43:59.818 --> 44:02.217
'and you breathe your last,

44:02.218 --> 44:05.375
'that will be your
evidence that you lived.'

44:06.378 --> 44:10.377
'The trace that you were here.
Your footprint on the moon.'

44:12.458 --> 44:15.377
'The people stood round your bed.

44:15.378 --> 44:19.377
'Nothing else matters, does it?
Just family.'

44:22.415 --> 44:25.177
We have to get back.
Go back in time.

44:25.178 --> 44:28.257
Avoid the stag do, 
heal the rift and save Libby.

44:28.258 --> 44:31.697
Libby! We have to get back to Libby!

44:31.698 --> 44:35.697
Quick, the turdis! Come on.

44:38.818 --> 44:40.137
What the fuck?!

44:40.138 --> 44:41.992
Run!

44:48.738 --> 44:51.097
Frank!

44:51.098 --> 44:53.377
Libby?

44:53.378 --> 44:55.577
It's me!

44:55.578 --> 44:58.737
Don't, Doctor. It's another mental
trick of the mind thing!

44:58.738 --> 45:02.537
Why settle for her
when you can have me?

45:02.538 --> 45:05.977
Frank! Come home, Frank!

45:05.978 --> 45:06.937
Who are you?

45:06.938 --> 45:08.017
Who are you?
Libby.

45:08.018 --> 45:09.577
Monica. Sheila.

45:09.578 --> 45:12.337
Your mother, your grandmother, 
your daughters, your fucks,

45:12.338 --> 45:16.337
your wallets and purses, doctors
and nurses. I am every woman and...

45:20.098 --> 45:24.097
I am Frank Gallagher!

45:36.338 --> 45:39.897
Libby's just getting over me dad
doing one. So not a word.

45:39.898 --> 45:42.457
You're too old to be
behaving like a teenager.

45:42.458 --> 45:44.641
School contract's too risky.
And it's shit money.

45:44.761 --> 45:47.217
It's payday.
Shane's raking it in at the school.

45:47.218 --> 45:49.337
He wants me to do all these
sick sex things with him.

45:49.338 --> 45:51.137
I didn't know he'd be
getting parole, did I?

45:51.138 --> 45:54.257
I get a cut of whatever you make
out of the business from now on.

45:54.258 --> 45:55.617
Fuck!

45:55.618 --> 45:56.497
Shane?

45:56.498 --> 45:58.617
Get everyone out!

45:58.618 --> 46:00.693
Fraaaank!
