WEBVTT

00:10.211 --> 00:12.247
You're discussing
critical space stuff

00:12.280 --> 00:15.316
with your pals the other day.

00:15.350 --> 00:17.318
DARYL: How would you
batch in space?

00:17.352 --> 00:18.954
With immaculate care.

00:18.987 --> 00:21.222
Yeah, it'd go airborne
if you didn't contain it.

00:21.256 --> 00:22.858
Depends on the length
of the missions, I thinks.

00:22.891 --> 00:25.326
Like, if it's
a pretty short mission,
you can probably gets away

00:25.360 --> 00:26.595
without mixing
a batch up theres.

00:26.628 --> 00:28.830
Maybe you can get away
without mixing a batch.

00:28.864 --> 00:30.666
I mix one every night
or I'm not sleeping.

00:30.699 --> 00:32.433
Kind of likes how I needs
to takes a shower

00:32.467 --> 00:34.302
immediately afters
I takes a shits?

00:36.972 --> 00:38.473
You'd cone it.

00:38.974 --> 00:40.241
What?

00:40.275 --> 00:42.210
Each spaceman's
given a cone,

00:42.243 --> 00:44.913
put over your junk,
for when you batch in space.

00:44.946 --> 00:47.716
They do?
So let's say you're in
your space quarters,

00:47.749 --> 00:50.285
you lay on your back
in your bunk,

00:50.318 --> 00:53.722
put the cone over your junk
and fire one up,

00:53.755 --> 00:56.257
and since
it's zero gravity,

00:56.291 --> 00:58.594
your batch'd float up
to the top of the cone,

00:59.327 --> 01:00.495
and remain there.

01:00.529 --> 01:01.563
Then what'll you do with it?

01:01.597 --> 01:03.965
Each cadet's got a space
disposal in their quarters,

01:03.999 --> 01:05.534
so he'll just
throw it in there.

01:05.567 --> 01:07.435
That what they do?
Most important thing

01:07.468 --> 01:09.705
is to obstruct the space cam
in your quarters

01:09.738 --> 01:13.374
so that the rest
of the space cadets
don't see you batching.

01:13.408 --> 01:15.343
I'd imagine they'd give
you a few cones.

01:15.376 --> 01:17.813
Probably stick one of
those cones over the camera.
Exactly.

01:19.681 --> 01:20.682
Wayne?

01:21.517 --> 01:22.350
Dan.

01:23.619 --> 01:25.854
How did youse acquires
this knowledge?

01:25.887 --> 01:27.689
You remember when I took
Angie down Disney?

01:27.723 --> 01:28.624
Yeah.

01:28.657 --> 01:30.726
Was having drinks in a bar
by Cape Canaveral

01:30.759 --> 01:32.393
and heard
some cadets talking.

01:32.427 --> 01:33.629
Space cadets?

01:33.662 --> 01:35.296
Don't fuckin'
piss me off, Dary.

01:35.330 --> 01:37.365
Isn't Cape Canaverals
a ways away from Disney?

01:37.398 --> 01:38.466
It's not that far.

01:38.800 --> 01:40.569
Okay.

01:40.602 --> 01:42.370
You're having a drinks
in Capes Canaverals

01:42.403 --> 01:43.705
and you overhear
some cadets

01:43.739 --> 01:45.807
talk something about
mixing a batch
ups in space?

01:45.841 --> 01:47.743
Did I stutter?

01:47.776 --> 01:50.378
Crazier things
have happened,
I guess.

01:50.411 --> 01:51.947
Was Bondars there?
Roberta?

01:51.980 --> 01:54.482
Yeah, Robertas Bondars,

01:54.516 --> 01:58.520
neuroscientist, Canada's
first female astronauts.

01:58.554 --> 02:00.522
Fucking legend,
Robertas Bondars.

02:00.556 --> 02:01.990
Yeah, Bondar was there.
Nice.

02:02.023 --> 02:04.526
What about the other guy,
um, what's his name?

02:04.560 --> 02:05.794
He just left,
apparently.

02:05.827 --> 02:06.962
Wow, rubbing shoulders

02:06.995 --> 02:08.630
with North America's
finest space cadets.

02:08.664 --> 02:09.998
Yeah.
Bondar hammered?

02:10.031 --> 02:11.533
No.

02:11.567 --> 02:14.770
No, I seen her crash
a few Old Fashioneds,

02:14.803 --> 02:17.539
but she was actually
sitting in a quiet corner
by herself.

02:17.573 --> 02:19.608
Wonder why
the other guys left.

02:19.641 --> 02:22.010
I don't have
that information, Dan.

02:22.043 --> 02:24.345
Can you imagine
if North America's
finest space cadets

02:24.379 --> 02:25.714
went ups into
outer space togethers?

02:25.747 --> 02:26.915
Oh, they did.
They dids?

02:26.948 --> 02:30.051
Yup. Houston wanted them
to go up there
together again, too.

02:31.452 --> 02:32.621
Bondar didn't wanna.

02:32.654 --> 02:33.722
Why nots?

02:33.755 --> 02:35.591
I don't think
you wanna know.

02:35.624 --> 02:36.892
Well, sures,
we dos.

02:44.032 --> 02:45.867
Look, youse didn't
hear this from me,
all right?

02:45.901 --> 02:46.968
All right.

02:47.002 --> 02:48.504
Dary, all right?
All right.

02:48.537 --> 02:50.005
Look, a lot of people
don't know this,

02:50.038 --> 02:52.708
but those two weren't
just North America's
finest spacemen,

02:52.741 --> 02:56.344
they were
actually planet Earth's
finest space people.

02:56.377 --> 02:57.513
So, of course,
Houston wanted them

02:57.546 --> 02:58.714
up there together
as much as possible.

02:58.747 --> 03:00.816
But they only went
up theres togethers
the one time?

03:00.849 --> 03:02.150
Yep.

03:02.183 --> 03:04.853
'Cause Bondars didn't
wants to go up theres
with him agains.

03:04.886 --> 03:06.688
Yeah.
Okay.

03:06.722 --> 03:10.391
So, like, he was as
a bit of a guy's guy
around Kennedy Center.

03:10.425 --> 03:11.927
You know, he played
pranks and stuff,

03:11.960 --> 03:14.062
and they'd just say,
"Well, that's just him."

03:14.095 --> 03:16.798
Of course, Bondar was
the more senior spaceman,

03:16.832 --> 03:19.601
had a bit of a reputation for,
like, kicking it old‐school.

03:19.635 --> 03:21.069
Hence, the Old Fashioneds.

03:21.102 --> 03:23.772
So she didn't have a lot
of time for the whole
boys‐will‐be‐boys mentality.

03:23.805 --> 03:24.840
'Kay.

03:24.873 --> 03:27.108
So, they finally shoe‐horned
them up there together,

03:27.142 --> 03:30.011
knowin' full well
it was oil and water.

03:30.045 --> 03:33.148
And I guess you can say
he proved them right.

03:33.181 --> 03:35.917
Those space cadets really
tell tales out of school, eh?

03:35.951 --> 03:37.786
Yep.
What happened next?

03:39.120 --> 03:41.723
So, each spaceman's
got a space cam

03:41.757 --> 03:43.158
in their quarters
which are connected

03:43.191 --> 03:44.926
to the other
spacemen's quarters,

03:44.960 --> 03:47.596
as well as the main shuttle bay
and the saucer section,

03:47.629 --> 03:50.131
the two smaller bays
and the stardrive section.

03:50.165 --> 03:51.700
They'd be connected
to the main bridge?

03:51.733 --> 03:53.068
Of course, they are,
Dary. Fuck's sake.

03:53.101 --> 03:54.736
So, we're talking about
an elite vessel here?

03:54.770 --> 03:57.739
NASA'd never send
a ship up there
if it wasn't galaxy class.

03:57.773 --> 04:00.642
You bet they wouldn't.
Same with Elon Musk,

04:00.676 --> 04:02.844
but apparently Russia
does it all the time.

04:02.878 --> 04:04.513
Fucking joke star fleet.

04:04.546 --> 04:05.914
So, what happened next?

04:05.947 --> 04:08.183
So, Bondar'd be up
in Alpha quadrant,

04:08.216 --> 04:11.086
keeping the Captain's
log, likely, of the events.
Yeah.

04:11.119 --> 04:13.755
And they'd all just come out
of a Yeager loop,

04:13.789 --> 04:15.056
so she was a bit worn out.

04:15.090 --> 04:16.157
Yeah, she wouldn't be
at full bars.

04:16.191 --> 04:19.160
But, of course, there's Bondar
still up there in Alpha,

04:19.194 --> 04:21.763
keeping an eye out
for wormholes and what not.
Yeah.

04:21.797 --> 04:23.899
I guess there he'd be
down there in Beta quadrant,

04:23.932 --> 04:25.701
floating around
in space quarters,

04:25.734 --> 04:27.636
which Bondar could see,
so could Houston.

04:28.169 --> 04:29.605
I guess what he'd do

04:30.471 --> 04:32.073
is float off‐camera,

04:32.107 --> 04:33.809
pull his space pants down,

04:33.842 --> 04:35.877
grab his junk in a bunch
in his hands...

04:35.911 --> 04:36.945
Like dinker‐ball?

04:36.978 --> 04:38.514
Sake, Dary.

04:38.547 --> 04:39.815
This is hard enough
to get through

04:39.848 --> 04:41.449
without you stopping
all over his story,
Dary.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.018
Sorry, good buddy.

04:43.051 --> 04:45.521
So, there he'd be
floating off camera.

04:45.554 --> 04:47.055
I guess what he'd do...
Allegedlys.

04:47.088 --> 04:49.490
...according to the cadets,

04:49.525 --> 04:52.060
is dip just his junk
back into frame.

04:52.093 --> 04:53.995
No.
Apparently did it
all the time.

04:54.029 --> 04:55.163
Where's Houston
in all this?

04:55.196 --> 04:56.532
Houston thought
it was hilarious.

04:56.565 --> 04:57.999
But Bondar didn't?
Nope.

04:59.701 --> 05:00.936
Bondar did not.

05:00.969 --> 05:02.003
Jesus Christ.

05:02.037 --> 05:04.740
I guess then what he'd do
is he'd get on his comms.

05:04.773 --> 05:05.641
Allegedlys.

05:05.674 --> 05:08.076
Just telling you
what the cadets
told me.

05:08.109 --> 05:09.945
He'd go like,

05:10.979 --> 05:13.181
(IMITATES RADIO STATIC)
"Hey, Bondar,

05:14.282 --> 05:16.785
"check out
space cam six."
No.

05:16.818 --> 05:18.186
Yep.
She report him?

05:18.219 --> 05:19.655
Oh, she reported it.

05:19.688 --> 05:20.889
Did they slap
sanctions on him?

05:20.922 --> 05:21.990
Yeah.

05:22.023 --> 05:23.091
Yeah, he got jacked up.

05:23.124 --> 05:24.726
Good for Houstons.
Mmm‐hmm.

05:25.961 --> 05:27.896
Of course, they were still
supposed to be up there

05:27.929 --> 05:29.765
another two months together,

05:29.798 --> 05:31.700
and things only got worse.
How?

05:31.733 --> 05:33.669
Remember what I was
saying about the cone?
Yeah?

05:33.702 --> 05:37.105
I guess whenever
it was Bondar's turn
to clean Beta quadrant,

05:37.138 --> 05:41.209
he would routinely batch
and not cone it.

05:41.242 --> 05:42.277
Inexcusables!

05:42.310 --> 05:44.746
I ain't Bondar to tell you
that's an understatement.

05:44.780 --> 05:45.681
I think she would, too.

05:45.714 --> 05:47.849
No, she never expected
to be floating around

05:47.883 --> 05:50.852
some spaceman's quarters trying
to catch airborne ejaculate

05:50.886 --> 05:52.187
in a plastic vacuum bag

05:52.220 --> 05:53.889
when she signed up
for space camp.

05:53.922 --> 05:55.624
No, they only tell you
about omega particles

05:55.657 --> 05:56.725
at space camp.
Mmm‐hmm.

05:56.758 --> 05:57.893
This went on
for two more months?

05:57.926 --> 05:58.927
Oh, no way, Dan.

05:58.960 --> 06:01.296
Oh, you better believe
Houston aborted the mission.

06:01.329 --> 06:03.231
Bondar had strict orders

06:03.264 --> 06:05.233
to Picard Maneuver
and warp 10 home.

06:05.266 --> 06:06.702
How many light years
away were they?

06:06.735 --> 06:08.537
I was gonna ask,

06:08.570 --> 06:10.706
but then the cadets would know
I was eavesdropping, so...

06:10.739 --> 06:12.073
Then what happened?

06:13.074 --> 06:13.975
(EXHALES)

06:14.009 --> 06:16.578

no cell phones inside

06:22.317 --> 06:24.252
"Well, what do you wanna
do here, Bondar?"

06:24.285 --> 06:25.787
Lets him have it.

06:25.821 --> 06:27.122
No.
No?

06:27.155 --> 06:29.558
No. You remember how
I said she's old‐school.

06:29.591 --> 06:30.659
Yeah.

06:30.692 --> 06:33.194
Bondar says to him, she says,

06:33.228 --> 06:36.064
"I'm gonna be down at the bar

06:36.097 --> 06:37.833
"That guy's gonna get
what's coming to him."

06:37.866 --> 06:40.235
Fucking buzzed herself
out of the boardroom.

06:41.302 --> 06:44.005
Dids he?
Well, Dan,

06:44.039 --> 06:47.743
one of them's up in space
doing space activities,

06:47.776 --> 06:50.646
the other one's
at a bar by Disney
drinking Old Fashioneds.

06:54.215 --> 06:56.084
That woman is
the portrait of class.

06:57.085 --> 06:58.319
She always has been.

06:59.821 --> 07:01.623

07:02.724 --> 07:04.292
Now, you can't be
especially sure

07:04.325 --> 07:05.894
those were even
real space cadets

07:05.927 --> 07:07.328
at the bar
by Kennedy that day

07:07.362 --> 07:09.765

so close to Disney.

07:09.798 --> 07:11.132

been playing pretend

like to do.

07:14.335 --> 07:16.672

if ever there was one, bud.

08:51.066 --> 08:52.934
You looks like
you're in a bad way
over there, Dary.

08:52.968 --> 08:54.235
Yeah, I'm in a real bad way.

08:55.303 --> 08:56.805
Have a beer.
I'm good.

08:56.838 --> 08:58.473
Ah, I don't need a beer either.

08:58.507 --> 09:00.909
Was actually thinking
about a water.

09:00.942 --> 09:02.978
Ah, for hell, I'm having one.
No one's driving, right?

09:03.011 --> 09:04.345
I'd have a beer.
WAYNE: Atta boy.

09:05.280 --> 09:06.782
What's the matter, Dary?

09:06.815 --> 09:08.283
I just...

09:08.316 --> 09:10.185
I haven't talked
to Anik in a bit.

09:10.218 --> 09:11.987
I haven't seen Aniks
in a fortnight.

09:12.020 --> 09:13.855
A fortnight?
Who the fuck are you?

09:13.889 --> 09:14.956
What she been up to, Dary?

09:14.990 --> 09:17.158
I don't know.
I do.

09:17.192 --> 09:19.194
You do?
Yeah, I've got Anik
on Instagram.

09:19.227 --> 09:20.762
She has an Instagram?
Airball!

09:20.796 --> 09:22.197
Dary,

09:22.230 --> 09:24.099
you don't know
about Anik's Instagram?

09:24.132 --> 09:25.834
Katy, my butt cheeks
are clenched up

09:25.867 --> 09:26.802
real tight right here.

09:26.835 --> 09:28.403
So, whatever
you're driving at,
get after it.

09:28.436 --> 09:29.905
Okay.

09:29.938 --> 09:32.107
I love a girl who knows
what she wants

09:32.140 --> 09:34.910
and gets it,
and I love Anik.

09:34.943 --> 09:38.980
But her Instagrams,
I mean, I love this too,

09:40.148 --> 09:41.282
but it's skanky.

09:41.316 --> 09:43.351
Uh‐oh!
A little Skank Sinatra?

09:43.384 --> 09:44.419
Little Skank Zappa?

09:44.452 --> 09:46.287
Skank Ocean.
Oh, bother.

09:46.321 --> 09:48.323
What're we talking about here,
little Tom Skanks?

09:48.356 --> 09:50.458
Little Skank Aaron?
Skanklin D. Roosevelt.

09:50.491 --> 09:51.760
Can I see?

09:51.793 --> 09:53.094
Are your butt cheeks
still clenched?

09:53.128 --> 09:54.162
Yes.

10:01.570 --> 10:02.771
Oh...

10:03.805 --> 10:05.006
That's a lot of likes.

10:05.040 --> 10:07.175
Well, life's
a drive through,
bud. Gotta just...

10:07.208 --> 10:08.443
Just keep
moving forward.

10:08.476 --> 10:09.511
So, should...

10:10.378 --> 10:11.479
Should I do something?

10:11.513 --> 10:13.348
Well, she hasn't called you

10:13.381 --> 10:18.854
and she's posting
motherfucking sexy photos,
like, three times a day,

10:18.887 --> 10:20.889
so, perhaps.

10:20.922 --> 10:22.357
Wayne?
Dary?

10:22.390 --> 10:24.392
What would you do
if your gal had like
a real racy Instagram account?

10:24.425 --> 10:26.828
Well, I haven't had to cross
that bridge yet, good buddy,

10:26.862 --> 10:28.564
but she'd be a shaky one.

10:28.597 --> 10:29.965
She'd be dangerous.

10:29.998 --> 10:31.466
She'd be Muay Thai jai alai.

10:31.499 --> 10:33.869
Take an eye, big brother.
Yeah, I'd have an eye.

10:37.072 --> 10:38.073
(WHOOPS MILDLY)

10:38.874 --> 10:40.341
(WHOOPS MILDLY)

10:40.375 --> 10:41.877
(WHOOPS MORE STRONGLY) Oh!

10:41.910 --> 10:44.112
In the words of
Scottie Wallis...
(WHOOPS)

10:44.145 --> 10:45.581
That's what I said.
I said... (WHOOPS)

10:45.614 --> 10:48.483
There's no way the photos
can be that... (WHOOPS)

10:48.517 --> 10:50.385
Holy fucking... (WHOOPS)

10:50.418 --> 10:53.221
We're talking "Y"
to the "E" to the "W"!

10:53.254 --> 10:55.023
I'm looking at yew!

10:55.056 --> 10:57.092
Come on, give me
a big old, yew, boy!

10:57.125 --> 10:58.960
All right, big brother,
let's get out of here.

10:58.994 --> 11:00.862
Where we going?
You're not going anywhere.

11:00.896 --> 11:02.430
Yeah, you stay here,
we gotta go get...

11:02.463 --> 11:03.799
Get something sorted.

11:05.033 --> 11:06.968
KATY: Where is
Scottie Wallis anyways?

11:07.002 --> 11:10.205
He keeps poor company!

11:10.238 --> 11:12.407
You know, it's
kind of suspicious.

11:12.440 --> 11:14.442
Twos of youse
going off to someplace

11:14.475 --> 11:16.612
we'res not allowed
to go to.

11:16.645 --> 11:19.080
Kind of makes
a feller wonder.

11:19.114 --> 11:21.583
I'm not gonna ask
any questions,

11:21.617 --> 11:24.019
'cause I'm pretty sure
I'll find out,

11:24.052 --> 11:26.187
sooner rather than later!

11:27.422 --> 11:29.357
Bad gas travels fast
in a small town!

11:29.390 --> 11:32.327
Hey, do you think
that, like,

11:32.360 --> 11:34.563
the other people in town
know about her racy
Instagram account?

11:34.596 --> 11:37.165
Well, Dary,
we have previously established

11:37.198 --> 11:39.901
that bad gas does travel fast
in a smalls town.

11:39.935 --> 11:44.272
But, uh, I do believe
racy photos travel faster.

11:44.305 --> 11:46.241
Oh, I'm getting hammered.
We're out of beers, bud.

11:46.274 --> 11:47.375
Then come with me to MoDeans?

11:47.408 --> 11:48.977
You don't have
to ask me twice.

11:49.678 --> 11:50.912
Yew!

11:56.484 --> 11:58.954
(ALL GIGGLING)

12:01.623 --> 12:03.892
Oh, fuck.
There he is.
Scottie Wallis.

12:03.925 --> 12:05.226
You need a big old yew!

12:05.260 --> 12:07.128
I stop the world
and met with yew!

12:07.162 --> 12:08.930
New York, I love yew!

12:08.964 --> 12:10.966
Looks like she's just
not that into yew!

12:10.999 --> 12:13.101
Bad gas travels fast
in a small town.

12:13.134 --> 12:15.103
Sexy photos travel
faster, boy, yew!

12:15.136 --> 12:17.072
Which we have
previously established.

12:17.105 --> 12:18.940
Dary, do you know
how many dudes
are jerking off

12:18.974 --> 12:20.441
to your girlfriend
right now? Yew!

12:20.475 --> 12:22.678
Wait, I actually know
the answer. Yew.

12:22.711 --> 12:26.114
Sixteen point
one thousand. Yew!

12:26.147 --> 12:27.549
I wailed on it
before I got here,

12:27.583 --> 12:29.918
but I'd wail
on it again. Yew!

12:29.951 --> 12:32.621
I just hammered on it too,
but, Dary, yew!

12:34.389 --> 12:36.257
Scottie Wallis here?
No.

12:36.291 --> 12:37.693
Thought we heard
Scottie Wallis.

12:37.726 --> 12:39.094
What's the kerfuffle?

12:39.127 --> 12:41.096

12:41.129 --> 12:42.964
Oh.

12:44.132 --> 12:45.500
And I just jerked off
to that.

12:45.534 --> 12:47.035
Jerked off to what?

12:47.068 --> 12:50.038
Stewart was just saying
that he jerked off
to Daryl sweetie's Instagram,

12:50.071 --> 12:51.172
and I was just saying
that I jerked off

12:51.206 --> 12:53.474
to Stewart jerking off
to Daryl sweetie's Instagram.

12:53.509 --> 12:55.410
You're gay?

13:22.571 --> 13:24.472
That's what I said.
I said, "Yew!"

13:24.506 --> 13:26.508
Scottie Wallis is saying,
"Yew‐hoo!"

13:26.542 --> 13:27.676
Where is Scottie Wallis?

13:27.709 --> 13:30.478
He keeps poor company.

13:30.512 --> 13:32.748
He's always good
for a Y‐E‐W!

13:32.781 --> 13:35.584
Somebody better tie
my dick to my leg boys. Yew!

13:35.617 --> 13:38.453

13:47.262 --> 13:48.664
Well, you can't take it

13:48.697 --> 13:49.831
Hey, big spender.

13:52.067 --> 13:53.635
You mind if I wear a leopard
print dress to this thing?

I wanted to tell you
face to face.

15:03.338 --> 15:04.806
But why? Because you're
Instagram famous now?

15:04.840 --> 15:06.842
No.
Because I heard that doesn't
have much of a shelf life
