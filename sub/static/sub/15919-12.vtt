12:51.930 --> 12:55.629
And he didn't
take any extra time.

12:55.639 --> 12:58.337
See, there you go.
- My goodness.

12:58.347 --> 12:59.962
We're so proud of you, baby.

12:59.972 --> 13:02.379
You did it. You didn't quit.

13:02.389 --> 13:05.920
Some people didn't believe it,
but a mother knows.

13:05.930 --> 13:07.753
Yeah, and now everyone knows.

13:07.763 --> 13:09.753
Grandma's been on the phone
all day

13:09.763 --> 13:13.129
talking about job offers
in "Los An-ge-les."

13:14.972 --> 13:18.421
There it is. L.A., baby.
- Wow.

13:18.431 --> 13:20.753
And why not?

13:20.763 --> 13:23.753
After all,
this is a time to celebrate.

13:23.763 --> 13:27.962
To my P.J. Congratulations.

13:27.972 --> 13:29.588
All: Congratulations.

13:29.598 --> 13:31.129
Thank you.

13:31.139 --> 13:33.629
Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

13:33.639 --> 13:34.753
Cheers.

13:36.556 --> 13:39.045
And thank you, Mom and Dad,

13:39.055 --> 13:43.004
for believing in me,
for supporting me.

13:43.014 --> 13:45.753
All right, I'm truly blessed.
Seriously.

13:45.763 --> 13:48.129
Oh, and I don't have any student
loans to pay off, so boom.

13:48.139 --> 13:53.753
None. I'm debt-free, baby.

13:53.763 --> 13:57.588
But, um, in all seriousness,
um, thank you,

13:57.598 --> 14:01.170
because you both promised
you'd give us an education,

14:01.180 --> 14:03.753
the tools of true freedom.

14:03.763 --> 14:07.296
And my journey's really just
beginning.

14:07.306 --> 14:08.421
I hope I make you proud.

14:08.431 --> 14:09.588
I hope you move out soon.

14:09.598 --> 14:11.546
Oh, yes.
- Stay in the kitchen.

14:11.556 --> 14:13.753
I second that.
- Whatever.

14:13.763 --> 14:15.004
No, no. My little brother.

14:15.014 --> 14:17.212
He just graduated.
No, no, it's okay.

14:17.222 --> 14:18.254
We got to get this done.

14:18.264 --> 14:19.504
Seriously, thank you,
Mom, Dad.

14:19.514 --> 14:21.962
Since we are all here,

14:21.972 --> 14:24.504
we may as well share
our good news.

14:24.514 --> 14:25.546
Yes.

14:25.556 --> 14:27.170
Me, Kenny, and the girls

14:27.180 --> 14:29.546
are moving to North Carolina.

14:29.556 --> 14:33.962
Me and my... fiancé have
both found jobs there.

14:33.972 --> 14:35.504
Whoa. Wait, what?

14:35.514 --> 14:38.753
It's "fiancé and I," Ni.

14:38.763 --> 14:41.045
Ma, she--
- Your what?

14:42.472 --> 14:44.087
You're--you're getting married?

14:44.097 --> 14:46.045
Wait, Naomi,
you're getting married?

14:46.055 --> 14:47.920
Kenny, where's the ring?

14:47.930 --> 14:49.795
I mean, she can't get married
without a ring.

14:49.805 --> 14:51.087
Uh-uh. I don't want one.
I want a house.

14:51.097 --> 14:52.795
Wait, Naomi,
you're getting married

14:52.805 --> 14:54.129
and you're moving where?

14:54.139 --> 14:55.546
Uh, North Carolina.

14:55.556 --> 14:57.629
I'm working at the pharmacy
at the new Kroger there.

14:57.639 --> 15:00.087
Hey. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

15:00.097 --> 15:03.296
Wow. Okay.

15:03.306 --> 15:05.129
Okay, well, congratulations.

15:05.139 --> 15:07.004
Um, I think--

15:07.014 --> 15:09.462
I guess that's two reasons
to celebrate this--this, uh--

15:09.472 --> 15:12.753
Absolutely.
- Aw!

15:12.763 --> 15:13.837
He's losing his baby girl.

15:13.847 --> 15:15.504
Aww, Boukie!

15:15.514 --> 15:16.795
Aw.

15:16.805 --> 15:19.170
Papi.

15:19.180 --> 15:22.920
So what you think, Niecy?

15:22.930 --> 15:24.879
You haven't said anything.

15:24.889 --> 15:30.045
Um, that's because I'm
so excited for you guys.

15:30.055 --> 15:31.629
Congratulations.

15:31.639 --> 15:33.753
Yeah. That's great.

15:33.763 --> 15:35.129
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:35.139 --> 15:38.045
Well, it's all fine
for you and Kitty, you know,

15:38.055 --> 15:42.421
but today,
we're celebrating Paul Jr.

15:42.431 --> 15:43.462
Yeah, thank you. Yeah.

15:43.472 --> 15:45.753
All right, Stu.

15:46.847 --> 15:48.546
Bye.

15:48.556 --> 15:49.629
Cake time.

15:49.639 --> 15:52.753
Sorry you had to pick up
the cake.

15:52.763 --> 15:53.879
I told my mom I would do it.

15:53.889 --> 15:54.889
I don't mind.

15:58.139 --> 15:59.588
Congratulations.

15:59.598 --> 16:01.462
I heard you're getting
the prime-time spot.

16:01.472 --> 16:03.753
Hopefully. Still negotiating.

16:03.763 --> 16:05.629
Yeah.

16:09.055 --> 16:10.462
You hear about
David's dog dying?

16:12.598 --> 16:13.753
Very sad.

16:22.347 --> 16:24.212
Cake, anyone?

16:24.222 --> 16:26.087
Ladies eat first.

16:35.689 --> 16:39.120
Hey.
- Hi.

16:39.130 --> 16:40.412
How did you get in?

16:40.422 --> 16:42.621
Oh, the door was unlocked.

16:42.631 --> 16:46.329
Oh. How did you get
past the gate?

16:46.339 --> 16:47.496
Is there a problem?

16:47.506 --> 16:50.662
No. Well, yes,
if my gate is broken.

16:50.672 --> 16:52.953
No, I just punched in the code.

16:53.672 --> 16:54.788
Who gave you the code?

16:54.798 --> 16:56.120
I just watched your driver
do it.

16:56.130 --> 16:57.579
It was four 1s.

16:57.589 --> 16:59.454
Really easy and very unsafe.

16:59.464 --> 17:01.412
I learned a lot of dos
and don'ts

17:01.422 --> 17:04.079
when I was talking
to the alarm company.

17:04.089 --> 17:06.329
Oh, Jesus, I got to take this.

17:06.339 --> 17:07.953
Hey, Kara.

17:07.963 --> 17:10.287
No, it's a great time.

17:10.297 --> 17:12.369
Yeah, no, I just got home.

17:12.380 --> 17:15.287
Yeah, no, girl, they are
tripping about this contract.

17:15.297 --> 17:17.454
How's your negotiation going?

17:17.464 --> 17:20.329
What?

17:20.339 --> 17:22.298
Why would they want
to put that in the contract?

17:27.005 --> 17:28.037
'Cause they're stupid.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.537
Yeah, or that. Or that.

17:29.547 --> 17:32.662
That's a good one.
Yeah, yeah.

17:32.672 --> 17:35.953
I want to--basically,
there's a lot of things

17:35.963 --> 17:37.662
I want to put in that deal
that, you know,

17:37.672 --> 17:40.162
I'm kind of afraid
to even ask for.

17:40.172 --> 17:42.953
♪ ♪

17:42.963 --> 17:45.329
Well, right, I mean,
who would've thought that, like,

17:45.339 --> 17:47.953
you need to put in a sign-off?

17:47.963 --> 17:49.704
It's, like, common sense,
common courtesy.

18:05.005 --> 18:06.621
I'm really sorry.

18:06.631 --> 18:09.120
It's okay.

18:09.130 --> 18:11.454
I-I can get it out. I-I just
need a little baking soda.

18:11.464 --> 18:13.245
It's okay.

18:13.255 --> 18:15.788
I certainly have my own opinion
about what this is about,

18:15.798 --> 18:18.995
but, uh, just to cover
the bases,

18:19.005 --> 18:21.746
do you have some kind of
medical condition?
- No.

18:21.756 --> 18:23.412
Psychiatric?
- No.

18:25.506 --> 18:27.120
Then what's going on?

18:27.130 --> 18:29.454
I-I have a lot of stuff
going on with the deal.

18:29.464 --> 18:31.162
That--that's all.

18:31.172 --> 18:33.621
In prior negotiations,
have you ever experienced this?

18:38.130 --> 18:39.153
No.

18:41.672 --> 18:43.537
It's about the dog.

18:45.464 --> 18:46.953
You're mad. Good.

18:46.963 --> 18:48.746
I'm not mad.
- You're sighing.

18:48.756 --> 18:51.370
That's because I'm breathing air
out of my body.

18:53.547 --> 18:56.953
Call him.
- No.

18:56.963 --> 18:58.829
No, 'cause it's--it's--

18:58.839 --> 19:01.037
it's not just about the dog.

19:01.047 --> 19:02.621
I know
it's not about the dog.

19:02.631 --> 19:04.204
It's because you love him.

19:04.214 --> 19:06.454
Call him and check up on him.

19:08.172 --> 19:10.746
I love it how society supports
and even encourages two people

19:10.756 --> 19:11.953
to never speak again
because they broke up.

19:11.963 --> 19:13.412
Sometimes you don't speak again

19:13.422 --> 19:15.162
because it's too hard
and it hurts.

19:15.172 --> 19:17.214
But you're hurting now
because you're not talking.

19:22.089 --> 19:25.953
You said it was a casualty
of breaking up,

19:25.963 --> 19:28.537
but if you don't deal with this,
then it becomes our casualty.

19:30.506 --> 19:34.079
I'm not mad, but I expect you
to deal with this,

19:34.089 --> 19:36.162
'cause I can't keep on buying
new mattresses.

19:36.172 --> 19:37.662
Please say
you're not gonna do that,

19:37.672 --> 19:39.412
'cause I-I can get it out.

19:39.422 --> 19:42.412
I can't believe this.

19:42.422 --> 19:47.746
You're, um--you're not gonna
tell anybody about this,

19:47.756 --> 19:49.287
are you?

19:50.756 --> 19:52.412
You said that you heard her say

19:52.422 --> 19:54.621
that she was going to pay
the rent,

19:54.631 --> 19:56.287
but was there
a written agreement?

19:56.297 --> 19:59.454
What you watching?

19:59.464 --> 20:02.120
I don't even know.

20:02.130 --> 20:03.579
The remote's all the way
over there.

20:03.589 --> 20:04.870
I can't reach it, so...

20:04.880 --> 20:06.412
The year's lease expires,

20:06.422 --> 20:08.870
it goes automatically
to a month-to-month.

20:08.880 --> 20:10.287
Okay.

20:10.297 --> 20:12.662
And then we
verbally confirmed that.

20:12.672 --> 20:15.829
You got to figure it out.

20:18.130 --> 20:21.579
I am happy for her.

20:21.589 --> 20:23.662
I am happy for my sister.

20:25.756 --> 20:29.079
I know you are.

20:29.089 --> 20:36.953
But seeing others move on
with their lives is hard

20:36.963 --> 20:40.496
when you feel like you're stuck
in the quicksand of yours.

21:01.214 --> 21:02.746
Congratulations.

21:03.839 --> 21:05.537
Yay, me!

21:07.506 --> 21:09.995
You seem more excited
about getting Cynthia's sign-off

21:10.005 --> 21:12.746
than closing your own deal.

21:12.756 --> 21:14.245
Yeah, my victory for her

21:14.255 --> 21:17.120
is really more of
a victory for me,

21:17.130 --> 21:19.037
'cause you know
I benefit from a successful--

21:22.339 --> 21:24.746
Successful...

21:24.756 --> 21:28.579
Babe, you have this bad habit of
not completing your sentences.

21:29.963 --> 21:31.995
Uh, Sheldon?

21:34.672 --> 21:37.537
What's up
with you and my toothbrush?

21:37.547 --> 21:39.079
I love having you over,

21:39.089 --> 21:42.537
but I just like things
in a particular way.

21:42.547 --> 21:44.537
And the particular way

21:44.547 --> 21:47.245
includes throwing out
my toothbrush every night?

21:47.255 --> 21:50.788
Baby, I'm just over 50
and set in my ways.

21:50.798 --> 21:53.579
Okay.

21:55.422 --> 21:57.162
Mm, no. Not okay.

21:57.172 --> 22:02.953
Um, just so I'm clear,
can you explain what your--

22:02.963 --> 22:06.788
your ways are, exactly?

22:06.798 --> 22:08.079
Okay.

22:08.089 --> 22:15.037
Um, it means I like things
the way I like them,

22:15.047 --> 22:16.704
and housing your toothbrush

22:16.714 --> 22:20.579
symbolizes something
that I don't believe in.

22:20.589 --> 22:22.079
What, like dental hygiene?

22:22.089 --> 22:23.995
No.

22:24.005 --> 22:27.120
Cohabitation.

22:27.130 --> 22:28.662
Living together?

22:28.672 --> 22:30.788
Yes.

22:30.798 --> 22:32.579
But how do you ever
intend to--

22:37.172 --> 22:38.953
You don't want to get married?

22:41.506 --> 22:42.953
No.

22:46.005 --> 22:48.079
Kids?

22:48.089 --> 22:49.704
No.

22:49.714 --> 22:53.412
Then what the hell
are we doing?

22:53.422 --> 22:56.412
I didn't really think we were
at that place

22:56.422 --> 22:58.621
to start having--

22:58.631 --> 23:00.037
N-no. No, no, no.

23:00.047 --> 23:02.454
You knew I was freezing my eggs.

23:02.464 --> 23:05.412
I tried to freeze my eggs
on national television!

23:05.422 --> 23:08.329
The segment was called,
"Modern-day Motherhood."

23:08.339 --> 23:11.995
Motherhood would imply that
a child is what is hoped for.

23:12.005 --> 23:13.953
That was just a TV gimmick.
I wasn't sure--

23:13.963 --> 23:15.079
No, no, no.
Don't--don't do that.

23:15.089 --> 23:17.037
Don't--don't do that, Sheldon.

23:17.047 --> 23:18.788
I haven't known you
for a very long time,

23:18.798 --> 23:22.329
but I know you're not a liar,
so let's not start now, okay?

23:22.339 --> 23:25.037
I thought I could introduce you
to my lifestyle.

23:25.047 --> 23:27.370
I thought it would be
a different option for us.

23:27.380 --> 23:29.162
I'm almost 39.

23:29.172 --> 23:31.704
Ain't nobody got time
for no fundamental shifts.

23:31.714 --> 23:33.662
I mean, okay, maybe you
like the mountains

23:33.672 --> 23:35.204
and I like the beach
and we can compromise

23:35.214 --> 23:37.412
and move to California,
but no kids and--and--and--

23:37.422 --> 23:39.204
and no marriage?

23:41.798 --> 23:45.079
Um, babe,
we haven't had sex yet.

23:45.089 --> 23:46.579
And whose fault is that?

23:46.589 --> 23:48.245
You haven't even made a move.

23:48.255 --> 23:51.162
Whoa. When?

23:51.172 --> 23:53.412
When it's not about your ex
and you peeing in the bed?

23:53.422 --> 23:55.953
Oh. Oh, oh, oh, okay.

23:55.963 --> 23:59.829
Look, I-I'm not in a rush
here, okay?

23:59.839 --> 24:01.454
Yeah, so say
all the salesgirls in Atlanta.

24:01.464 --> 24:03.245
Oh, come on.

24:03.255 --> 24:04.829
"Oh, no, no. No, no, not yet.
Not--not--not yet."

24:04.839 --> 24:06.245
Are we here to talk,
or we here to win?

24:06.255 --> 24:07.788
Well, no, okay.
No, no. Let's--let's talk.

24:07.798 --> 24:09.245
Let's talk,

24:09.255 --> 24:12.953
because women clearly
need to rewrite the rules

24:12.963 --> 24:15.329
of this whole dating crap.

24:15.339 --> 24:18.329
We can't even begin to ask
you guys the real questions

24:18.339 --> 24:19.953
we need to know the answers to,

24:19.963 --> 24:22.287
like, "Do you want
to have children?"

24:22.297 --> 24:24.162
Do you want to get married?"

24:24.172 --> 24:27.537
Because if we ask those things,
we're called crazy,

24:27.547 --> 24:30.079
and if we're called crazy, then
we can't get to the second date

24:30.089 --> 24:32.621
where we can prove to you that
we're not crazy or desperate.

24:32.631 --> 24:34.454
So we--we dance around it.

24:34.464 --> 24:38.162
We dance around it,
hoping for the best.

24:40.047 --> 24:42.204
Sheldon, you said
we were in a relationship.

24:42.214 --> 24:43.329
I asked you point blank.

24:43.339 --> 24:44.370
You said yes.

24:44.380 --> 24:46.079
Yes, we are.

24:46.089 --> 24:48.662
But I--it's not--

24:48.672 --> 24:51.204
listen, we are
in a relationship,

24:51.214 --> 24:54.621
but--but I'm not in it
to have marriage and children.

24:54.631 --> 24:56.412
I'm not gonna give up
my individuality

24:56.422 --> 24:58.287
for the promise
of marriage and kids.

24:58.297 --> 25:02.162
And I don't want
to waste my time.

25:02.172 --> 25:06.204
You know, that's ironic,
because up until this point,

25:06.214 --> 25:07.788
we seemed to be
having a pretty good time.

25:07.798 --> 25:11.496
Pretty good, at best.

25:11.506 --> 25:12.953
Whatever you want to call it.

25:12.963 --> 25:14.704
It kept you
coming back every night.

25:14.714 --> 25:16.953
Well, when you're almost 40,

25:16.963 --> 25:19.788
you got divorcées,
you got married men,

25:19.798 --> 25:21.953
you have 25-year-old fetuses,

25:21.963 --> 25:23.829
and you have old men
who get their rocks off

25:23.839 --> 25:26.079
organizing things,
playing sudoku,

25:26.089 --> 25:27.287
and coasters.

25:32.255 --> 25:34.995
I want a baby,

25:35.005 --> 25:37.496
and you knew that
when you barged into my life.

25:37.506 --> 25:41.412
When you came to my job,
you knew I wanted a baby.

25:41.422 --> 25:43.370
So have a baby.
- With who?

25:43.380 --> 25:46.621
The way that women
have babies these days.

25:46.631 --> 25:48.120
I don't know.

25:48.130 --> 25:52.245
Okay, just--
just so I get this straight,

25:52.255 --> 25:54.829
you want me to have a baby
with a sperm donor

25:54.839 --> 25:56.953
but we still have
a relationship?

25:56.963 --> 25:58.162
I don't want to put
any labels on it.

25:58.172 --> 25:59.162
We don't have to do that.

25:59.172 --> 26:00.953
Where would I get my mail

26:00.963 --> 26:02.621
in this freak show fantasy
of yours?

26:02.631 --> 26:05.162
The same place
you get your mail now.

26:05.172 --> 26:06.788
Look,
if things start going well,

26:06.798 --> 26:09.995
then we could get two condos
on the same floor,

26:10.005 --> 26:12.412
or I can get a compound,
and then we can have--

26:12.422 --> 26:13.953
Whoa, oh, my God.
Am I in the Twilight Zone?

26:13.963 --> 26:15.412
You know, I mean--

26:15.422 --> 26:17.204
Is this some new, like,
pimp game I'm not hip to?

26:17.214 --> 26:20.662
Would you stop interrupting me
and let me finish, please?

26:20.672 --> 26:22.829
Your mail would go
to your house,

26:22.839 --> 26:24.037
because we would be

26:24.047 --> 26:27.662
in a mutually respectful
relationship

26:27.672 --> 26:31.079
where you would have your life
and I would have mine.

26:31.089 --> 26:34.329
That way, when we
decide to be together,

26:34.339 --> 26:36.037
we know
it would unequivocally be

26:36.047 --> 26:38.287
because we want
to be together,

26:38.297 --> 26:40.788
not because we feel obligated
to do so.

26:40.798 --> 26:43.204
It's not hard to understand.
It's just different.

26:46.839 --> 26:48.537
Too different for me.

26:50.963 --> 26:53.370
So thank you.

26:53.380 --> 26:57.788
I'm--I'm going to pass
on what's behind door number one

26:57.798 --> 27:03.746
and, uh, take my pride
and, uh...

31:01.964 --> 31:04.162
In my day of journalism,

31:04.172 --> 31:06.496
we were told we were
the fourth pillar of democracy,

the watch dog,

31:07.589 --> 31:09.329
making sure government
and industry

31:09.339 --> 31:10.703
were not taking advantage

31:10.713 --> 31:13.079
of the very people
who put them in office

31:13.089 --> 31:16.120
or funded their
multimillion-dollar salaries.

31:16.130 --> 31:18.703

to shine a light on the stories

31:18.713 --> 31:19.995
that mattered most,

35:37.797 --> 35:39.703
Me and Adam are thinking
about splitting up,

35:39.713 --> 35:41.079
which would be cool.

35:41.089 --> 35:43.162
I mean, I could just open
my own smaller office,

35:43.172 --> 35:45.496
and let's see.

35:45.506 --> 35:46.995
I'm sure you've already heard

35:47.005 --> 35:49.287
Mary Jane and I had
a horrible fight.

35:49.297 --> 35:52.912
No. Me and Mary Jane
don't talk anymore.

35:52.922 --> 35:56.037
Oh. I thought the two of you
were at least still cordial.

35:56.047 --> 35:58.412
Well...

35:58.422 --> 36:00.912
How you doing? You look good.

36:00.922 --> 36:02.079
I am.

36:02.089 --> 36:03.412
Your friend Valerie,

36:03.422 --> 36:06.204
she recommended me
to a really good therapist.

36:06.214 --> 36:07.538
Really?
- Yeah.

36:07.548 --> 36:08.870
That's really cool, Lis.

36:08.880 --> 36:11.579
It's official;
I suffer from depression.

36:11.589 --> 36:14.703
Oh. I'm sorry
about the joke before.

36:14.713 --> 36:17.287
Please. I am figuring out
all my issues.

36:17.297 --> 36:18.870
Really?
- Mm-hmm.

36:18.880 --> 36:20.329
Figured out some triggers.

36:20.339 --> 36:21.454
That's really good, man.

36:21.464 --> 36:23.714
I was hoping that she'd be able--
- Yeah, you're one.

36:26.089 --> 36:28.954
Me?
- You.

36:28.964 --> 36:31.204
Why? How?

36:31.214 --> 36:32.287
Come on, David.

36:32.297 --> 36:33.287
Come on, what?

36:33.297 --> 36:35.037
Where are we going? What?

36:35.047 --> 36:38.246
Look, you've always known
I've had feelings for you.

36:38.256 --> 36:39.787
Yeah, we're friends.

36:39.797 --> 36:41.079
Don't do that, David.

36:41.089 --> 36:42.703
Don't do what?

36:42.713 --> 36:45.287
Look, I know you don't share
the same feelings as me.

36:45.297 --> 36:48.079
I'm clear about that.

36:48.089 --> 36:51.496
I'm just ready to own the fact
that I carry feelings for you.

36:51.506 --> 36:54.037
I'm not proud of it.

36:54.047 --> 36:57.412
And, in fact, I have a lot
of guilt surrounding it,

36:57.422 --> 36:59.162
and I want to tell Mary Jane.

36:59.172 --> 37:01.703
Ugh, if I just--
I know she may never forgive me,

37:01.713 --> 37:03.703
but if I'm ever gonna have
a chance

37:03.713 --> 37:05.538
of regaining
my relationship with her,

37:05.548 --> 37:08.120
I need to begin again
in truth.

37:08.130 --> 37:09.829
Oh, my God.

37:09.839 --> 37:12.954
What is happening to me?

37:17.130 --> 37:19.079
Hey.

37:19.089 --> 37:20.787
What are you doing?

37:20.797 --> 37:24.162
Heading home.
- What are you doing?

37:24.172 --> 37:26.829
Negro, do not act like
me loving you is new for you.

37:26.839 --> 37:28.329
Well, then how
I am supposed to act?

37:28.339 --> 37:29.870
'Cause that's exactly
what this is.

37:29.880 --> 37:32.496
No, you cannot act
like I got here by myself.

37:32.506 --> 37:33.870
Lisa, look.

37:33.880 --> 37:36.496
I understand that that one night
meant a lot to you--

37:36.506 --> 37:38.912
That night and all the ones
that followed.

37:38.922 --> 37:40.745
Oral sex is still sex.

37:40.755 --> 37:43.538
Don't act
like I'm in this alone.

37:43.548 --> 37:44.745
Don't act like you don't know

37:44.755 --> 37:48.703
what affection from a woman
feels like.

37:48.713 --> 37:51.412
I am not proud of it,
but I own it.

37:51.422 --> 37:52.870
Okay, this is ridiculous.

37:52.880 --> 37:55.912
When Mary Jane kicked you out
when you broke up,

37:55.922 --> 37:58.703
who was rubbing your back,
letting you crash on my couch

37:58.713 --> 38:00.703
until you figured out
your next move?

38:00.713 --> 38:03.496
When you were sick,
who was getting soup for you?

38:03.506 --> 38:05.579
And when all of this stuff
with Mary Jane was going on,

38:05.589 --> 38:07.870
who told you about the sperm?

38:07.880 --> 38:09.829
And who took care of your dog
all the damn time

38:09.839 --> 38:11.703
when you were flying
out of town?

38:11.713 --> 38:13.329
I mean, hell,
look who is cooking

38:13.339 --> 38:14.912
and cleaning for you now.

38:14.922 --> 38:17.454
And who gave you 50 grand
for your company?

38:17.464 --> 38:20.412
That was an investment, Lisa,
and you know it was.

38:20.422 --> 38:24.829
No. That was a woman in love
with you giving you money.

38:24.839 --> 38:27.329
But it was easier
for you to not believe it,

38:27.339 --> 38:28.412
because it benefitted you.

38:28.422 --> 38:30.287
That was an investment.

38:30.297 --> 38:31.538
You were paid back.

38:31.548 --> 38:32.787
We have paperwork.

38:32.797 --> 38:34.329
That's all it was?

38:34.339 --> 38:35.703
Does Mary Jane know about it?

38:37.713 --> 38:39.246
You didn't tell M.J.
about the money

38:39.256 --> 38:40.703
or the other stuff,

38:40.713 --> 38:43.538
because you feel
just as guilty as I do.
