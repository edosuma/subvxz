00:02.836 --> 00:05.212
Can you help me pick
an engagement ring for Monica?

00:05.380 --> 00:07.089
I can't figure this out. It's so hard.

00:07.257 --> 00:10.718
Should I get her a Tiffany cut,
or a princess cut or a...

00:10.885 --> 00:12.803
Ow! Paper cut!

00:13.972 --> 00:15.347
Have you told anyone else?

00:15.515 --> 00:18.517
No, I don't want to tell anybody.
I don't want Monica to find out.

00:18.685 --> 00:19.768
You told me.

00:19.936 --> 00:22.479
Well, that's because I trust you,
and we're best friends...

00:22.647 --> 00:25.441
...and you walked in on me
while I was looking at ring brochures.

00:26.526 --> 00:28.861
Well, once again, not knocking pays off.

00:29.696 --> 00:32.990
- I only wish you hadn't been on the toilet.
- Me too.

00:35.326 --> 00:36.326
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:36.494 --> 00:39.496
- Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?
- Oh, all right.

00:39.664 --> 00:42.041
Oh, perfect. We were just gonna see
if you wanted to go.

00:42.208 --> 00:45.711
Oh, well, we don't,
because we got the other place.

00:48.631 --> 00:50.841
How rude.

00:51.551 --> 00:52.843
Oh, I'm sorry. You want a bite?

01:33.927 --> 01:36.345
So how are things going with Paul?

01:36.513 --> 01:37.846
- Good.
- Huh.

01:38.014 --> 01:40.641
- Although, you know, he's a private guy.
- Mm-hm.

01:40.809 --> 01:44.019
You know, I wish I could get him
to open up a bit. Share some feelings.

01:44.187 --> 01:48.857
That's easy. You just have to think of him
as a jar of pickles that won't open.

01:50.693 --> 01:51.693
So, what are you saying?

01:51.861 --> 01:54.696
I should run him under hot water
and bang his head against a table?

01:56.116 --> 01:59.660
No, that's what you do when you want
to get the truth out of someone.

02:03.331 --> 02:05.207
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:05.375 --> 02:06.667
- How are you?
- Watch this.

02:06.835 --> 02:08.377
- Hey, Paul.
- Hi, Phoebe.

02:08.544 --> 02:10.378
So how are things going with you?

02:12.090 --> 02:13.882
Can't complain.

02:19.597 --> 02:21.181
- Hey!
- Hi.

02:21.349 --> 02:23.308
- Great to...
- Ross, good to see you too.

02:23.476 --> 02:26.061
- Good. Bye.
- You take care.

02:31.359 --> 02:34.945
Hey, Pheebs, what was the deal with you
and Chandler blowing us off before?

02:35.113 --> 02:36.947
Ah, that was so weird, huh?

02:38.575 --> 02:39.700
Phoebe, why did you do it?

02:39.868 --> 02:42.828
I didn't do it. It was Chandler.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.831
He's... He's mad at you.

02:46.499 --> 02:50.085
- What? Why?
- Oh, please. I think you know why.

02:51.045 --> 02:52.588
I can't think of anything.

02:52.755 --> 02:56.592
Come on, Ross. You're a paleontologist.
Dig a little deeper.

02:59.304 --> 03:02.639
Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I
didn't invite him to that Knicks game...

03:02.807 --> 03:04.057
...a couple weeks ago?

03:04.225 --> 03:07.186
Do you think that's something
that he'd be mad at you for?

03:07.812 --> 03:11.148
- I guess it could.
- Well, then I think that's it.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.484
Well, if he's angry,
he really shouldn't just cover it up.

03:14.652 --> 03:16.403
I wish he'd just tell me the truth.

03:16.571 --> 03:17.905
Well, if that's what you want...

03:18.072 --> 03:21.825
...then you should run him under hot water
and bang his head against the table.

03:24.787 --> 03:27.497
Honey, I made a reservation
at China Garden. Is that okay?

03:27.665 --> 03:29.249
Yeah, that's great.

03:29.417 --> 03:33.587
But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me.
Tell me about your day.

03:34.339 --> 03:35.756
It was fine.

03:37.425 --> 03:38.425
Okay.

03:40.428 --> 03:42.846
Hey, what are you thinking?
What are you thinking right now?

03:43.014 --> 03:46.725
That you are looking really fine
in that dress.

03:47.435 --> 03:50.062
Yeah, that's great, Paul.
But, you know...

03:51.022 --> 03:53.941
I want to know what...
Wow, those are really great.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.403
I just want to know...

03:58.571 --> 04:02.658
...what is behind this strong,
silent exterior?

04:02.825 --> 04:05.118
You know, they say
that still waters run deep...

04:05.286 --> 04:07.704
...and I want to swim in yours.

04:09.999 --> 04:11.667
Are you talking about having sex?

04:13.253 --> 04:14.670
No, Paul.

04:14.837 --> 04:16.338
I don't know anything about you.

04:16.505 --> 04:19.591
You know, like your childhood.
Tell me about your childhood.

04:19.759 --> 04:21.093
Normal.

04:21.970 --> 04:25.889
Okay, well, then how about puberty?
Come on. That's always a painful time.

04:26.057 --> 04:28.308
You know, your friends invite you
to a slumber party...

04:28.476 --> 04:30.143
...and stick your hand in warm water...

04:30.311 --> 04:32.980
...while you're sleeping
so that you pee in your sleeping bag.

04:35.024 --> 04:37.067
No, that never happened to me.

04:37.735 --> 04:41.405
Well, you're lucky you never
met that bitch, Sharon Majeski.

04:42.365 --> 04:43.782
Anyway...

04:44.409 --> 04:47.160
The rest of your life, you know.
Any regrets?

04:48.162 --> 04:49.621
No.

04:50.164 --> 04:52.207
All right, Paul.
I'm not asking for a lot here.

04:52.375 --> 04:55.544
Just give me something. Anything.

04:56.629 --> 04:58.505
- Okay.
- Okay.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.093
- When I was 6 years old...
- Mm-hm.

05:03.261 --> 05:05.220
...I wanted a Big Wheel.

05:05.471 --> 05:08.348
And instead, my parents
got me this little...

05:08.516 --> 05:12.311
...plastic chicken
that you hop around on.

05:12.979 --> 05:15.105
It was embarrassing.
Kids made fun of me.

05:15.273 --> 05:17.107
That was a pretty tough year.

05:18.484 --> 05:20.819
- That's great. See?
- Heh.

05:20.987 --> 05:24.156
I already feel like I know you a little better.
Thank you.

05:24.324 --> 05:27.326
Okay, come on.
Now we can go eat. Let's go.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.204
It was horrible.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.752
They called me "Chicken Boy."

05:44.385 --> 05:47.471
In fifth grade, I got in a fight.
Well, it wasn't really a fight.

05:47.638 --> 05:49.473
Richard Danville bit me on the nose.

05:49.640 --> 05:52.559
I fell down, still have a little scar
right here. You can see it.

05:52.727 --> 05:55.645
Yeah, yeah. I see the scar.

05:55.813 --> 06:00.942
Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that,
you know, you've shared your feelings.

06:01.110 --> 06:02.903
It's really... It's beautiful.

06:03.071 --> 06:06.239
But, um, what do you say
we go share some food?

06:06.407 --> 06:08.408
No, I couldn't eat now.

06:08.576 --> 06:12.329
What are you talking about?
You love their Kung Pao chicken.

06:13.998 --> 06:15.791
Chicken?

06:18.628 --> 06:22.339
- Chicken Boy!
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

06:29.013 --> 06:31.890
Well, this is the nine millionth ring store
we've been to...

06:32.058 --> 06:33.934
...and I can't find the perfect ring.

06:34.102 --> 06:37.437
Ugly ring, ugly ring, ugly ring...

06:40.358 --> 06:41.608
It's a beautiful selection.

06:44.654 --> 06:46.279
Okay, so maybe you don't get her a ring.

06:46.447 --> 06:48.824
Maybe you do something different,
you know?

06:48.991 --> 06:52.202
Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet.
Or an engagement tiara.

06:52.995 --> 06:57.332
Ooh! An engagement
Revolutionary War musket.

06:58.584 --> 07:00.919
You know, I'm so glad I picked you
to help me with this.

07:01.087 --> 07:02.087
- Huh?
- Uh-huh.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.089
Can't you imagine getting down
on one knee...

07:04.257 --> 07:07.467
...and handing her this gorgeous
piece of weaponry?

07:08.636 --> 07:10.470
Yeah, I'm gonna stick with the ring.

07:12.473 --> 07:14.182
Oh, this one's nice. I like it this one.

07:14.350 --> 07:17.561
Sir? Kind sir, can I see this one?

07:17.728 --> 07:20.605
Wait a minute.
This is the reason you brought me, okay?

07:20.773 --> 07:23.483
I know how to haggle.
So let me handle this from here on out.

07:23.651 --> 07:25.110
Can I help you?

07:25.278 --> 07:28.822
- Yes, I would like to see that ring, please.
- Or not. Whatever.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.950
This ring is from the 1920s.

07:32.118 --> 07:35.620
It's a one-and-a-half karat diamond
with sapphires on either side.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.414
Sir, could I ask you to, um?

07:37.582 --> 07:41.835
Could you hold out that ring
and ask me to marry you?

07:43.671 --> 07:45.589
- Okay.
- Okay.

07:47.216 --> 07:48.550
Will you marry me?

07:49.719 --> 07:51.970
Oh, my God, that's it. That's the ring.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.807
- How much is it?
- Chandler, I will handle this.

07:56.225 --> 07:57.851
How much is it?

07:58.561 --> 08:00.061
Eight thousand six hundred.

08:00.229 --> 08:02.481
We will give you $10.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.485
- Are you interested in this ring?
- Yes. Yes.

08:06.652 --> 08:08.778
But I can only pay $8000.

08:09.822 --> 08:13.408
- Okay. I can let it go for 8.
- We stand firm at $10.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.411
- How would you like to pay?
- Uh, credit card.

08:16.579 --> 08:19.206
Oh, no. No, no,
but I lent my credit card to Joey.

08:19.373 --> 08:22.334
- Okay, I'll go get it. You guard the ring.
- Okay.

08:23.377 --> 08:25.712
Listen, I'm sorry about before.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.381
Do you have anything here for $10?

08:28.549 --> 08:31.843
Uh, yes. I have these two
rather beautiful...

08:32.010 --> 08:34.221
...five-dollar bills.

08:36.474 --> 08:38.725
I'll give you $1 for them.

08:41.312 --> 08:44.481
Hey, remember how Chandler
and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?

08:44.857 --> 08:46.191
No.

08:47.318 --> 08:50.946
- Remember, you were eating pizza?
- Yeah.

08:52.114 --> 08:54.241
Well, apparently
Chandler's angry at us...

08:54.408 --> 08:57.327
...for not getting him a ticket
to that Knicks game a couple weeks ago.

08:57.495 --> 08:59.746
What, we were supposed
to just get him a ticket?

08:59.914 --> 09:03.375
- That guy is always mooching off of us.
- Yeah.

09:04.418 --> 09:08.255
Anyway, I still think we should
try to patch things up, you know?

09:08.422 --> 09:11.716
Like, maybe we could get him tickets
to another Knicks game and invite him.

09:11.884 --> 09:16.179
Wow, that's a great idea.
And I still have his credit card.

09:16.347 --> 09:17.556
Here you go.

09:17.723 --> 09:20.850
Hey, hey. I got this one. Here you go.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.604
You know, I gotta tell you,
sometimes I just don't get Chandler.

09:24.772 --> 09:27.232
You know, me and him
do stuff all the time without you...

09:27.400 --> 09:29.401
...and you don't get all upset.

09:31.946 --> 09:34.364
- All the time?
- All the time.

09:36.325 --> 09:38.785
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

09:39.787 --> 09:42.831
- Still crying?
- Like a little girl.

09:44.542 --> 09:47.210
I know, I know, I know.
This is all my fault.

09:47.378 --> 09:49.337
I wanted him to open up.

09:49.505 --> 09:51.464
But God, I didn't know
that I was gonna unleash...

09:51.632 --> 09:56.011
...this weepy, clingy, moist monster.

09:56.804 --> 09:59.931
You know, I only know
of two sure-fire ways to shut a man up.

10:00.099 --> 10:01.182
And one of them is sex.

10:01.809 --> 10:03.059
- What's the other?
- I Don't know.

10:03.227 --> 10:04.811
I never had to use the other one.

10:05.938 --> 10:09.149
I'm just saying, you know,
if we're having sex, he's not talking.

10:09.317 --> 10:11.985
Ah, that's right. You're the talker.

10:15.906 --> 10:17.866
- Anyway, uh, great idea.
- Yeah.

10:18.034 --> 10:21.369
Um, I gotta go to the store. I told him
that I would buy him some more tissues.

10:21.537 --> 10:23.371
- Uh, we have some here.
- No, you don't.

10:25.791 --> 10:30.670
Okay. Um, I'd also like to try on the tiara.

10:32.715 --> 10:34.758
Oh, yeah. Okay.

10:36.719 --> 10:39.596
Wow, what do you think? Too much?

10:40.473 --> 10:42.057
A tad.

10:42.850 --> 10:45.185
Then take the tiara back...

10:45.353 --> 10:48.521
...and let me hold the musket again.

10:56.864 --> 10:58.948
Something's missing.

10:59.450 --> 11:02.327
Let me see the ring
that my friend picked out.

11:03.454 --> 11:05.664
Where's the 1920s princess-cut ring?

11:05.831 --> 11:08.166
I just sold it to that gentleman.

11:08.334 --> 11:09.918
Oh, my God!

11:10.086 --> 11:11.294
Wait, no!

11:15.508 --> 11:18.051
Let me out! Now!

11:24.100 --> 11:25.475
Rachel?

11:25.726 --> 11:27.060
No.

11:27.978 --> 11:30.730
- How are you, Paul?
- Okay.

11:35.653 --> 11:37.028
Chandler...

11:38.280 --> 11:42.075
...did your dad ever hug you?
- No. Did he hug you?

11:43.494 --> 11:45.078
No. No.

11:45.246 --> 11:48.540
It's just that my dad never did.

11:50.376 --> 11:51.418
I miss my dad.

11:51.836 --> 11:54.879
Well, you can see my dad in Vegas
kissing other dads.

12:00.302 --> 12:02.387
- Hey, Chandler?
- Yeah?

12:02.555 --> 12:04.055
Would you?

12:09.311 --> 12:10.520
Would you hug me?

12:12.273 --> 12:16.401
- I'm a little busy here, Paul.
- That's exactly what my dad used to say.

12:17.069 --> 12:19.612
Okay. A quick one. Come on, hug it out.

12:19.780 --> 12:21.781
Hey. Hey.

12:21.949 --> 12:23.241
There you go.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.119
Okay.

12:26.495 --> 12:28.288
- Five more seconds...
- Okay.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.834
- Joey!
- What? Hey, what...?

12:36.589 --> 12:38.840
Hi. Paul, is it?

12:39.800 --> 12:42.385
- Do you have my credit card?
- Yeah. It's in my...

12:42.553 --> 12:44.429
In my pocket.

12:48.142 --> 12:49.934
- My back pocket. Back pocket.
- Thank God.

12:51.687 --> 12:55.064
- Listen, I got tickets to the Knicks tonight.
- I can't go.

12:55.232 --> 12:56.524
Come on, it'll be fun.

12:56.692 --> 13:01.070
Me, you, Ross and... Paul, probably.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.327
Chandler, I found the perfect ring.

13:07.495 --> 13:10.497
Oh, that's pretty nice,
but I'm gonna go with the one I picked first.

13:10.664 --> 13:14.626
Oh, wake up, Chandler.
The one you picked is gone. It's over.

13:15.419 --> 13:16.878
What?

13:17.046 --> 13:21.049
Some guy bought it. I'm sorry.
I tried to stop him but they put me in jail.

13:22.343 --> 13:26.221
- They put you in jail?
- The little jail between the doors!

13:26.597 --> 13:29.641
- Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring.
- I know. I'm sorry.

13:29.809 --> 13:33.770
But, you know, this ring is better.
And Monica never even saw the other ring.

13:33.938 --> 13:38.483
Yeah. But when he proposed to me
with the ring, I got goose bumps.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.694
- Maybe it was the guy.
- It was the ring.

13:44.573 --> 13:48.576
- Hey, so was he excited about the tickets?
- No. He blew us off.

13:48.744 --> 13:50.703
- What?
- I know.

13:50.871 --> 13:52.789
I can't believe it.

13:53.415 --> 13:55.124
Can I tell you something?

13:55.876 --> 13:57.919
I'm a little mad at him now.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.339
Can I tell you something?

14:02.883 --> 14:04.384
Me too.

14:06.762 --> 14:09.639
You know what? He didn't want
to talk to us about being angry?

14:09.807 --> 14:12.392
Well, maybe we don't talk to him
at all.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.644
Ooh.

14:15.187 --> 14:16.604
- Freeze him out.
- That's right.

14:16.772 --> 14:18.356
- I like it.
- Ah? We'll show him.

14:18.524 --> 14:22.277
From now on, it's gonna be
Joey and Ross, best friends.

14:22.444 --> 14:25.780
Okay, we're gonna be
the new Joey and Chandler. Ha, ha.

14:30.119 --> 14:31.578
Hi, I'm back.

14:31.745 --> 14:33.830
There's more to tell you.
I've written it all down.

14:33.998 --> 14:35.915
Oh, that's great.

14:37.626 --> 14:40.253
No, actually, that's...

14:40.504 --> 14:43.047
That's great. That's really great.

14:43.215 --> 14:48.052
You know, I gotta tell you, writing,
all that writing, it gets me, uh...

14:48.220 --> 14:50.680
It gets me kind of hot.

14:50.848 --> 14:53.474
Wait, wait. Listen to this:

14:54.393 --> 14:57.103
Know what I wanted to be
when I was that age?

14:57.605 --> 14:58.980
A lover?

14:59.440 --> 15:01.274
- A surfer.
- Oh, yeah. A surfer?

15:01.859 --> 15:05.028
- I wanted to be one with the waves...
- Honey, hold on real quick.

15:05.195 --> 15:09.699
Hold on a second. Let me just get
a little more comfortable here.

15:09.867 --> 15:11.034
Wait a second.

15:11.201 --> 15:14.412
- This isn't too revealing, is it?
- No.

15:15.164 --> 15:17.582
Whatever happened to that little dude?

15:18.834 --> 15:20.919
So full of dreams.

15:23.088 --> 15:26.758
I don't care about the little dude.

15:27.217 --> 15:30.219
I can't. I cannot listen
to any more of this.

15:30.387 --> 15:33.932
The only one who'd listen to this
is a mental health professional.

15:34.099 --> 15:36.434
And that's only because
they get paid $100 an hour.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.937
Do you know how much money
I could've made listening to you?

15:39.104 --> 15:40.647
Two thousand dollars.

15:40.814 --> 15:43.816
And you know when I figured that out?
While you were talking.

15:44.818 --> 15:48.821
I can't believe you're trying
to stifle me, when just 14 hours ago...

15:48.989 --> 15:52.700
...we figured out that that's exactly
what my mother was trying to do to me.

15:54.078 --> 15:55.453
I'm sorry.

15:55.621 --> 15:59.666
I don't mean...
I didn't mean to stifle you.

15:59.833 --> 16:02.502
This is all just a little overwhelming.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.420
Oh, Rachel.

16:05.506 --> 16:07.382
I'm so sorry.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.009
I didn't mean to overwhelm you.

16:10.177 --> 16:13.346
It's just that when those gates open...

16:13.973 --> 16:17.308
...it's hard to close them.

16:19.937 --> 16:22.230
But they are closed now. Believe me.

16:22.398 --> 16:26.067
I'm so glad. I'm so glad you shared.

16:26.694 --> 16:29.404
And I'm glad that you're done.

16:31.824 --> 16:34.117
So, what do you say we, um...

16:36.328 --> 16:38.955
- I'd really like that.
- Mm-hm.

16:49.383 --> 16:52.301
That was so good.

17:02.229 --> 17:04.731
Oh, oh, ugh.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.693
- Hey.
- I can't believe you talked me into...

17:08.861 --> 17:11.194
...buying this stupid
gumball-machine-looking ring.

17:11.363 --> 17:15.199
It's not a stupid gumball-machine-looking
ring. It's a beautiful ring.

17:15.409 --> 17:16.909
No, it's not.

17:17.077 --> 17:18.453
When I looked at the other ring...

17:18.619 --> 17:20.747
...I could see Monica's face
when I gave it to her...

17:20.955 --> 17:22.457
...and I could see her saying yes.

17:22.624 --> 17:24.791
When I look at this ring,
all I see is a ring.

17:24.960 --> 17:29.547
Unless I look at it really closely,
and then I can see my own eye.

17:34.178 --> 17:37.263
Look, this is the most important thing
I'm gonna do in my life.

17:37.431 --> 17:39.223
I want to make sure it's perfect.

17:39.391 --> 17:42.810
Okay. There may be a way
that we could get the other ring back.

17:42.978 --> 17:45.730
Because I heard the guy tell the jeweler
where he was gonna propose.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.232
So maybe we could get him
to trade rings or something.

17:48.484 --> 17:49.901
I can't do that.

17:50.069 --> 17:53.154
Well, you certainly can't give her
that stupid gumball ring.

18:02.164 --> 18:03.414
There he is.

18:03.582 --> 18:06.501
Okay, and he hasn't proposed yet.
She has no ring on her finger.

18:06.668 --> 18:09.545
Wow, you're good.
After this, we should solve crimes.

18:09.713 --> 18:12.173
Yeah. Okay. Go get him.

18:12.841 --> 18:14.258
Oh, okay.

18:16.720 --> 18:20.556
Excuse me, sir. Could you come with me,
please? You have a phone call.

18:21.308 --> 18:23.267
- Who is it?
- It is your office.

18:23.602 --> 18:25.895
- Do you know who at my office?
- John.

18:26.063 --> 18:27.271
Oh, John. Great.

18:30.984 --> 18:32.860
- There he is.
- Hi. Hi. Okay.

18:33.028 --> 18:35.029
Okay, there was a mix-up
at the jewelry store.

18:35.197 --> 18:38.574
The ring you're about to propose with
was supposed to be held for me.

18:38.742 --> 18:41.077
So I'm gonna need to have that back.

18:42.204 --> 18:47.917
But in exchange, I'm willing to trade you
this beautiful, more expensive ring.

18:50.045 --> 18:51.838
Wow, I would trade.

18:53.382 --> 18:56.843
It is beautiful, but I'm gonna use
this one. Now, if you'll excuse me.

18:57.010 --> 19:00.304
No, no. See, this is my fiancée,
and her heart was set on that ring.

19:00.472 --> 19:02.682
You don't want to break her heart now,
do you?

19:02.850 --> 19:06.102
Yeah. Do you want to break
a dying woman's heart?

19:07.020 --> 19:08.229
You're dying?

19:11.984 --> 19:13.442
Yeah, she's dying...

19:13.610 --> 19:15.987
...of a cough, apparently.

19:17.865 --> 19:21.951
It's my dying wish to have that ring.
See, if I'm not buried with that ring...

19:22.119 --> 19:25.204
...then my spirit will wander
the netherworld...

19:25.372 --> 19:26.706
Okay, that's enough, honey.

19:28.375 --> 19:30.084
Oh, I don't know.

19:32.129 --> 19:34.964
- Let me see the ring.
- Great. Okay, here.

19:37.342 --> 19:40.011
- All right, I'll do it.
- Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

19:40.179 --> 19:43.389
And you are about to marry
a wonderful man.

19:49.438 --> 19:51.689
Hey, I'm marrying a dead woman.

19:58.405 --> 19:59.989
Guys?

20:02.993 --> 20:05.036
I got something important to tell you.

20:06.622 --> 20:07.955
Guys.

20:09.416 --> 20:12.084
Guys?

20:14.087 --> 20:15.755
I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.

20:18.759 --> 20:21.302
I think we gotta end the freeze-out.

20:23.555 --> 20:25.389
Wait a minute. Is this for real?

20:25.557 --> 20:27.475
Yeah. Check out the ring.

20:28.268 --> 20:30.353
Oh, my God.

20:31.188 --> 20:33.814
So you two are really serious?

20:35.651 --> 20:37.485
Yeah, pretty much.

20:38.195 --> 20:41.364
You're gonna get married? I mean...

20:41.865 --> 20:44.825
We're gonna be brothers-in-law.
Come here!

20:45.869 --> 20:49.872
- And we're gonna be friends again.
- Hey.

20:50.832 --> 20:52.208
What?

20:52.376 --> 20:55.544
- Water under the bridge. Forget it!
- Okay.

20:56.046 --> 20:59.340
I was gonna wait till it was official,
you know, but I had to tell you guys...

20:59.508 --> 21:00.841
...because you're my best friends.

21:02.261 --> 21:06.180
- I think I'm gonna cry.
- Oh. No more crying.

21:06.348 --> 21:09.308
Please, I just dumped one crybaby.
I'll dump you too.

21:11.311 --> 21:13.896
I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.

21:14.147 --> 21:17.817
Oh, my God.

21:17.985 --> 21:21.237
Oh, Chandler.
You guys are gonna be so happy.

21:21.488 --> 21:24.532
- I know.
- Where's all the tissues?

21:31.581 --> 21:32.623
Check out the ring.

21:32.791 --> 21:35.876
Oh, nice. One-and-a-half karat, easy.

21:37.713 --> 21:38.879
- Hey.
- Hey, Pheebs.

21:39.047 --> 21:40.923
Chandler's gonna ask Monica
to marry him.

21:41.091 --> 21:42.925
I know. I helped pick out the ring.

21:43.093 --> 21:44.635
Oh.

21:46.346 --> 21:49.265
You told her before you told us?

21:50.100 --> 21:52.560
She walked in
while I was looking at ring brochures.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.770
You can understand that, right?

21:56.481 --> 22:02.069
Guys?
