ls it possible
that such consuming dedication

l feel your concern, captain,

at the beginning of his duty cycle
eight weeks ago.

09:22.520 --> 09:23.895
They were in perfect health.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.273
Nothing else since?

A single medical entry
noting that the first officer

09:29.735 --> 09:33.280

09:39.662 --> 09:42.122

was the Darwin Genetic

on Gagarin lV, three days ago.

09:47.712 --> 09:49.588

it could be something

09:49.797 --> 09:52.799
that the Lantree crew already had,
or it could have come from Gagarin.

09:53.009 --> 09:57.220

l can't think of anyone

11:54.046 --> 11:58.758
Doctor, we're experiencing the
rapid onset of geriatric phenomena.

11:58.968 --> 12:02.971
The first symptom
is sudden acute arthritic inflammation.

12:03.180 --> 12:06.015
Then the aging process
accelerates.

12:06.225 --> 12:07.559
The Lantree.

12:07.768 --> 12:12.313
Dr. Pulaski, I celebrated
my 35th birthday a week ago.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.652
Doctor, we understand
that Darwin Station is involved

12:17.862 --> 12:20.447
in genetic research.
ls there a possible connection?

12:20.656 --> 12:22.866
Our research here
is limited to human genetics.

12:23.075 --> 12:26.077
I can assure you we're not dealing
with something that got away from us.

12:26.287 --> 12:28.663
We believe that we were infected
by a supply ship

12:28.873 --> 12:30.623
that was here three days ago.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.876
Doctor,
if you're speaking of the Lantree,

12:33.085 --> 12:35.628
we encountered it a few hours ago.

12:35.838 --> 12:37.797
All the crew members were dead.

12:38.632 --> 12:40.759
Which would seem
to confirm our suspicion.

12:40.968 --> 12:43.470
Were you able
to establish a pathology, doctor?

12:43.679 --> 12:44.804
Did you hear what l said?

12:45.014 --> 12:48.516
All the 26 men and women
aboard that ship were dead.

12:48.726 --> 12:51.394
I heard you, captain,
and the prognosis is alarming.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.772
But my immediate concern
is our children.

12:53.981 --> 12:55.023
Children?

12:55.232 --> 12:57.776
They represent years
of advanced genetic research.

12:57.985 --> 13:00.278
You must evacuate them
as soon as possible.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.238
l'm sorry,
but under the circumstances,

13:02.448 --> 13:03.615
until we know what's going on,

13:03.824 --> 13:06.493
l'm imposing a full quarantine
on Darwin Station.

13:06.702 --> 13:08.953
But the children
have been in protective isolation

13:09.163 --> 13:11.623
since this was detected.
They've shown no symptoms.

13:11.832 --> 13:13.500
You cannot leave them here to die.

13:13.709 --> 13:18.087
Doctor, our options in a quarantine
situation are extremely limited.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.715
We are going to consider
the possibilities.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.551
l suggest you do the same.

13:26.096 --> 13:28.348
WORF: l recommend against contact,
captain.

13:28.557 --> 13:31.142
- Number One?
- l have to agree, sir.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.895
l wish there was something
we could do, but the risk is too great.

13:34.104 --> 13:35.146
Doctor?

13:35.356 --> 13:37.941
lf the children are free of disease,
as Dr. Kingsley said,

13:38.150 --> 13:39.317
they should be evacuated.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.277
l would like to bring
one of them aboard

13:41.487 --> 13:44.864
within a force field
for a complete examination.

13:45.074 --> 13:47.742
Counselor, do you sense anything?

13:47.952 --> 13:51.454
Dr. Kingsley sincerely believes
the children are not a threat.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.957
But she's not telling us
the whole truth.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.667
l recommend caution.

13:57.962 --> 14:02.006
We have only Dr. Kingsley's assurance
that these children are not infected.

14:02.216 --> 14:06.845
Whereas we have seen the results
of this disease firsthand.

14:07.054 --> 14:12.225
ln a case like this, l think
we should err on the side of caution.

14:12.643 --> 14:13.810
All right.

14:14.395 --> 14:17.188
We could beam up one child
encased in styrolite,

14:17.398 --> 14:18.690
in suspended animation.

14:18.899 --> 14:22.110
That way,
l could scan for possible infection

14:22.319 --> 14:24.737
without danger to ourselves
or to the child.

14:24.947 --> 14:26.531
But we don't know
what we're looking for.

14:26.740 --> 14:28.032
PULASKl:
Exactly.

14:28.242 --> 14:30.827
And we won't
until we start gathering data.

14:31.036 --> 14:33.371
Captain, that's worth some risk.

14:33.581 --> 14:35.915
There's always risk, doctor.

14:40.462 --> 14:41.796
Proceed with the examination.

14:42.006 --> 14:45.633
But l shall require positive proof
that these children are harmless

14:45.843 --> 14:48.344
before l place any of my crew
in jeopardy.

14:56.520 --> 14:59.689
- Force field's ready, captain.
PlCARD: Activate.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.112
Transporter?

15:06.322 --> 15:08.865
O'BRlEN [OVER RADlO]: This is
Chief O'Brien, sir. Almost ready.

15:09.074 --> 15:12.035
PlCARD: ls there a problem?
- lt's the styrolite.

15:12.244 --> 15:13.369
l'm altering the Delta T,

15:13.579 --> 15:17.081
so the styrolite coating materializes
two microseconds ahead of the child.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.292
lt has to be right the first time.

15:19.501 --> 15:20.919
Well, take all the time you need.

15:21.128 --> 15:22.921
Entering corrections now, sir.

15:24.632 --> 15:25.673
Ready, captain.

15:28.052 --> 15:32.013
Dr. Kingsley,
are you ready to transport?

15:32.222 --> 15:33.556
KlNGLSEY:
You have the coordinates.

15:33.724 --> 15:37.685
We have one 1 2-year-old male
encased in number six styrolite.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.355
Transporter...

15:41.106 --> 15:42.315
...energize.

15:46.904 --> 15:48.404
- A trick!
- Transporter, reverse the--

15:48.614 --> 15:51.324
One moment, lieutenant.
Whoever he is, he's still in stasis.

15:55.371 --> 15:57.372
Styrolite is intact, captain.

15:59.208 --> 16:00.333
Force field down.

16:16.225 --> 16:20.353
Captain, there's a definite presence.

16:20.562 --> 16:24.524
A distinct personality.
Even in stasis, it's quite strong.

16:24.733 --> 16:27.193
The child
is unquestionably telepathic.

16:27.403 --> 16:29.904
A child this mature?

16:30.531 --> 16:33.616
We could be looking
at the future of humanity.

16:33.784 --> 16:35.284
Hmm.

16:35.786 --> 16:39.330
At least Dr. Kingsley's vision of it.

17:10.154 --> 17:12.447
This child is in better health
than we are.

17:12.656 --> 17:14.240
His immune system is so advanced,

17:14.450 --> 17:17.410
it may not be possible for him
to contract disease.

17:17.619 --> 17:20.204
l want to free him from the styrolite.

17:20.414 --> 17:21.956
That seems rather risky, doctor.

17:22.166 --> 17:25.126
l can do no further tests
until he's animate.

17:26.003 --> 17:28.046
But what if you're wrong?

17:28.255 --> 17:30.339
You saw what happened
on the Lantree.

17:30.549 --> 17:33.426
- l know l'm right.
- l can't expose the Enterprise

17:33.635 --> 17:36.596
until l know where this disease
came from and how it is transmitted.

17:36.805 --> 17:38.139
l realize that, captain.

17:38.348 --> 17:40.641
Naturally, we'll establish
a force field containment.

17:40.851 --> 17:43.770
But if we lose the force field
for any reason, we lose the ship.

17:43.979 --> 17:48.232
- Force fields can fail, and until--
- We don't have that kind of time.

17:48.442 --> 17:52.070
Now, these children can't survive
in the lab once their parents are dead.

17:52.654 --> 17:54.822
Look at him, captain.

17:56.158 --> 17:58.826
He's a human being
who needs our help.

17:59.036 --> 18:01.370
- But the risk is--
- Minimal.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.543
lf you can demonstrate
that he is biologically harmless

18:07.753 --> 18:10.046
without risk to the crew,

18:10.756 --> 18:13.966
l'll do everything in my power
to assist.

18:14.802 --> 18:18.513
And, doctor, God knows
l'm not one to discourage input,

18:18.722 --> 18:19.764
but l would appreciate it

18:19.973 --> 18:23.101
if you'd let me finish my sentences
once in a while.

18:37.699 --> 18:40.576
- Deanna, do you have a minute?
- Mm-hm.

18:40.786 --> 18:43.204
You've known the captain
for some time.

18:43.413 --> 18:44.747
l think l need some advice.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.749
l don't seem to be dealing with him
very well.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.000
Why do you say that?

18:48.210 --> 18:50.169
My arguments don't seem
to have any effect on him.

18:50.379 --> 18:53.923
We just end up quoting regulations
to each other.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.801
He has such a consuming dedication
to his ship.

18:57.010 --> 18:58.594
He doesn't seem to be able
to step back

18:58.804 --> 19:01.722
to see the human side
of the equation.

19:02.349 --> 19:03.558
What's the matter?

19:03.767 --> 19:06.602
Kate,
l don't think he'd be where he is

19:06.812 --> 19:09.480
if he couldn't see
the human side of the equation.

19:09.690 --> 19:12.817
Perhaps the two of you
aren't all that different.

19:13.026 --> 19:14.068
What do you mean?

19:14.945 --> 19:20.741
Let's just say you both have
well-established personalities.

19:34.923 --> 19:38.050
Dr. Kingsley, this is Kate Pulaski.

19:38.552 --> 19:40.553
Doctor, do you have a decision?

19:40.762 --> 19:42.305
l'm afraid it's bad news.

19:42.931 --> 19:44.515
How can that be?

19:44.725 --> 19:46.976
The risk to the ship and crew
is too great.

19:47.186 --> 19:50.188
Until we absolutely know the cause
of the disease, the children--

19:50.397 --> 19:51.731
The children are harmless.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.943
Every test on them
has been negative.

19:56.403 --> 19:58.738
I demand that you do something
to save them.

19:59.406 --> 20:01.157
Please, doctor.

20:02.826 --> 20:06.662
For God's sake,
we haven't got much time.

20:07.289 --> 20:09.749
Stand by. l'll get back to you.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.421
Geordi, l need your help.

20:15.631 --> 20:17.340
LA FORGE:
What is it, doctor?

20:17.549 --> 20:19.926
l need to prove
that the children are harmless.

20:20.135 --> 20:22.345
l can only do that
in a fail-safe environment.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.055
Problem is,
there's no area of the ship

20:24.223 --> 20:26.307
that can be sealed off
with absolute certainty.

20:26.516 --> 20:27.767
Even with force fields.

20:27.976 --> 20:29.644
Sickbay has an isolated system.

20:29.853 --> 20:33.397
But it's not possible to totally
cut it off from the rest of the ship.

20:33.607 --> 20:35.650
The only truly independent
environment

20:35.859 --> 20:38.569
would be something
like a shuttlecraft.

20:38.779 --> 20:40.071
A shuttlecraft.

20:40.280 --> 20:42.740
Why didn't you say so?

20:49.706 --> 20:50.748
Come.

20:52.125 --> 20:55.795
Captain, l'd like permission
to put the boy in a shuttlecraft.

20:56.004 --> 20:58.673
l can study him there
without risk to anyone else.

20:58.882 --> 21:01.467
- What about you?
- l am prepared to take that risk.

21:01.677 --> 21:05.763
Someone has to breathe the same air
he breathes, to touch him.

21:05.973 --> 21:09.350
l'm volunteering
to make that test myself.

21:09.726 --> 21:12.979
Doctor, you have a responsibility
to this ship, which goes--

21:13.188 --> 21:16.399
l also have a responsibility
to humanity.

21:16.608 --> 21:19.443
Starfleet guidelines about contact
with quarantined--

21:19.653 --> 21:22.571
You don't have to quote
the rule book.

21:26.076 --> 21:28.035
You were saying?

21:29.037 --> 21:30.288
Request approved.

21:30.497 --> 21:33.833
Captain, you said if l--

21:34.042 --> 21:35.376
Approved?

21:36.169 --> 21:39.839
l recognize that you're trying
to satisfy my conditions.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.759
Thank you.

21:55.397 --> 21:57.481
- You sent for me, doctor?
- l did, commander.

21:57.691 --> 22:00.359
l assume that you're qualified
to pilot this shuttlecraft?

22:00.569 --> 22:01.944
DATA:
Certainly. l took advanced training

22:02.154 --> 22:03.946
in the operation
of auxiliary space vessels

22:04.156 --> 22:05.948
at Starfleet Academy
where l received--

22:06.158 --> 22:07.658
A more than passing grade,
no doubt.

22:07.868 --> 22:10.328
Please, come aboard.
We don't have much time.

22:10.495 --> 22:12.246
[ALARM WAlLlNG]

22:13.707 --> 22:17.460
COMPUTER:
Shuttlebay 3 force field activated.

22:35.312 --> 22:37.355
You are certain
the captain approved this, doctor?

22:37.564 --> 22:40.024
You'll take us a few hundred meters
away from the Enterprise

22:40.233 --> 22:42.026
and hold position.

22:42.235 --> 22:45.154
Begin shuttlecraft launch sequence.

23:06.802 --> 23:08.719
Good luck, doctor.

23:20.190 --> 23:22.358
We are in position, doctor.

23:22.567 --> 23:25.611
lt's the only way
to prove they're harmless.

23:26.488 --> 23:28.030
And if they are not?

23:29.157 --> 23:31.700
l hate to keep reminding you,
but you are a machine.

23:31.910 --> 23:34.120
You'll be perfectly safe.

23:34.830 --> 23:36.622
That is by no means certain, doctor.

23:36.832 --> 23:38.707
But l was referring to you.

23:40.502 --> 23:44.338
Medical research
is sometimes a risky business.

23:45.674 --> 23:47.508
lt's all part of being human.

23:47.717 --> 23:49.844
Shall we proceed?

23:51.555 --> 23:53.180
Ready to transport.

23:53.390 --> 23:55.808
You have the coordinates,
Chief O'Brien.

23:56.017 --> 23:58.227
Shuttlecraft,
maintain your position and stand by.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.354
Standing by.

24:09.531 --> 24:11.490
Transporter control,
what's our status?

24:11.700 --> 24:13.325
We have a green panel, sir.

24:14.119 --> 24:17.288
- Stand by to transport.
- Aye, sir.

24:17.497 --> 24:18.539
Energize.

24:55.035 --> 24:56.577
Oh, yes.

24:57.204 --> 24:58.829
l do.

24:59.039 --> 25:01.457
l understand you perfectly.

25:02.501 --> 25:04.043
How could you, doctor?

25:04.252 --> 25:06.003
He has not said anything.

25:06.630 --> 25:09.256
PULASKl:
Oh, yes, he has. Troi is right.

25:09.466 --> 25:11.634
He's telepathic.

25:31.780 --> 25:32.821
Time?

25:32.989 --> 25:36.158
COMPUTER:
Zero-three-two-two, exactly.

25:36.826 --> 25:40.829
She's been in direct contact
with the boy for 1 8 minutes.

25:47.879 --> 25:51.090
All systems are functioning
within normal specifications, doctor.

25:51.299 --> 25:53.592
The manufacturer will be pleased
to hear it.

25:54.135 --> 25:57.471
l appreciate your help,
but your bedside manner needs work.

25:57.681 --> 25:59.223
Bedside manner?

25:59.391 --> 26:01.183
[GASPS]

26:02.852 --> 26:04.436
Doctor?

26:18.952 --> 26:22.204
PlCARD [OVER RADlO]: Doctor, I don't
understand. What has happened?

26:23.623 --> 26:26.542
- There was no warning.
- Explain.

26:26.751 --> 26:28.961
Arthritic inflammation.

26:29.170 --> 26:31.255
lt's the initial symptom
of the disease.

26:32.591 --> 26:35.259
- What can we do?
- Return the boy to Darwin Station.

26:35.468 --> 26:38.762
Apparently, the children are carriers.

26:44.728 --> 26:46.979
PlCARD:
Chief O'Brien, are you ready?

26:49.357 --> 26:52.318
l have the original coordinates
of the Darwin isolation lab, captain.

26:52.527 --> 26:53.652
Quickly, please.

26:53.862 --> 26:55.988
Shuttle 1 , hold your position.

26:57.490 --> 26:59.074
Holding.

27:01.995 --> 27:04.288

lt wasn't your fault.

27:17.010 --> 27:19.303
PlCARD:
Tell us what you need, doctor.

27:19.512 --> 27:22.014
There's nothing you can do, captain.

27:22.223 --> 27:24.141
l'm not going
to make myself an exception

27:24.351 --> 27:25.768
to the Darwin quarantine.

27:25.977 --> 27:27.561
Shuttle 1 out.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.190
What is your condition, doctor?

27:31.399 --> 27:34.485
Not exactly up to factory specs.

27:34.944 --> 27:36.779
l'm sorry.

27:36.988 --> 27:38.906
The pain is tolerable, thank you.

27:39.115 --> 27:41.784
Shall l set course
for Darwin Station?

27:41.993 --> 27:44.203
We're already under quarantine.

27:44.412 --> 27:46.872
What do we have to lose?

27:50.085 --> 27:52.670
We can no longer consider
the Darwin Station crisis

27:52.879 --> 27:54.380
our most immediate concern.

27:54.589 --> 27:59.343
Although Dr. Pulaski's condition
is inseparably linked

27:59.552 --> 28:00.594
with that emergency,

28:00.804 --> 28:03.889
her safe return,
and that of Commander Data,

28:04.099 --> 28:05.974
must take priority, please.

28:06.184 --> 28:09.019
Shouldn't Dr. Pulaski
be involved in this?

28:09.229 --> 28:10.604
From what we've seen
on the Lantree,

28:10.814 --> 28:12.898
Dr. Pulaski may not have time
to help herself.

28:13.108 --> 28:15.901
Well, l suggest we beam them both
back on to the ship.

28:16.111 --> 28:18.654
Commander Data
is most likely immune,

28:18.863 --> 28:20.406
and surely the biofilter will--

28:20.615 --> 28:22.783
The transporter's biofilter
won't protect us.

28:22.992 --> 28:26.704
The boy was transported twice already
and still infected Dr. Pulaski.

28:26.913 --> 28:29.123
Yeah, but couldn't we adjust
the biofilter?

28:29.332 --> 28:30.833
We could alter the filter
to screen out

28:31.042 --> 28:32.793
whatever it is
that's causing the disease.

28:33.002 --> 28:35.295
But we don't know
what's causing the disease.

28:35.505 --> 28:38.173
We can't protect ourselves
against the unknown.

28:38.383 --> 28:40.592
What we need is some kind of filter

28:40.802 --> 28:43.512
that doesn't depend
on known biological factors.

28:45.056 --> 28:47.641
We might try the trace.

28:47.851 --> 28:48.976
The transporter trace.

28:49.185 --> 28:51.770
As you know, the transporter
keeps a record of all transmissions,

28:51.980 --> 28:53.313
a pattern, if you will.

28:53.523 --> 28:56.150
Usually, it's just stored
for security purposes.

28:56.359 --> 29:01.155
But if we use the transporter trace
to control the reconstitution process...

29:01.656 --> 29:04.992
l don't think it's ever been tried
quite that way before,

29:05.201 --> 29:06.744
but theoretically, it is possible.

29:08.621 --> 29:10.914
l'd have to make
extensive modifications.

29:11.124 --> 29:13.792
Then do it.
lt seems we have no alternative.

29:14.002 --> 29:15.711
RlKER:
Where will we get the trace pattern?

29:15.920 --> 29:17.713
The doctor's never used
our transporter.

29:17.922 --> 29:20.507
- Never?
- No, she's a woman

29:20.717 --> 29:22.468
of very strongly held opinions, sir.

29:22.677 --> 29:24.219
What was her previous assignment?

29:24.429 --> 29:26.764
Her last ship was the Repulse.

29:28.349 --> 29:29.850
Bridge. Picard.

29:30.059 --> 29:35.355
Contact the USS Repulse using
subspace captain's priority channel.

29:49.454 --> 29:52.164
Oh, Dr. Pulaski.

29:52.707 --> 29:57.461
l can only tell you how much l regret
the burden we've imposed on you.

29:57.670 --> 29:59.004
On both of you.

29:59.214 --> 30:01.799
Commander Data is an android.
He's unaffected.

30:02.008 --> 30:03.550
As for me, l chose this.

30:03.760 --> 30:06.720
l was convinced
the children were safe.

30:06.930 --> 30:10.224
l still can't believe you were infected
by one of our children.

30:10.433 --> 30:12.643
The evidence is fairly conclusive.

30:12.852 --> 30:16.063
You don't understand.
They were designed to resist disease.

30:16.272 --> 30:19.608
l think it's time we talked about that.

30:20.401 --> 30:21.735
Let me show you something.

30:38.878 --> 30:40.796
Our ultimate achievement.

30:41.297 --> 30:44.591
The oldest is 1 2,
and all are telekinetic.

30:44.801 --> 30:46.677
Watch.

30:52.058 --> 30:54.476
Genetically engineered.

30:54.686 --> 30:56.645
Not engineered, created.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.522
Perfect in every way.

30:58.731 --> 31:02.609
Their body structure,
their musculature, their minds.

31:02.819 --> 31:05.571
You were telling me
about their immune system.

31:05.780 --> 31:07.239
That was our masterpiece.

31:07.448 --> 31:10.242
We gave these children
an aggressive immunity.

31:10.869 --> 31:13.745
The rest of us were infected
by the supply ship,

31:13.955 --> 31:15.163
but they were protected.

31:15.373 --> 31:16.957
The Lantree logs indicated

31:17.166 --> 31:20.586
that only one crewman had any illness
prior to arrival here.

31:20.795 --> 31:23.755
The first officer
had a mild case of Thelusian flu.

31:23.965 --> 31:27.509
Yes. He was one of the crewmen
who came in direct contact with us.

31:27.719 --> 31:30.470
The Thelusian flu
would have little effect on you,

31:30.680 --> 31:33.432
but, tell me, how would they react?

31:33.641 --> 31:36.435
Their immune system
would release an active antibody

31:36.644 --> 31:38.186
that would attack the virus.

31:38.396 --> 31:39.980
Even at a distance?

31:40.189 --> 31:43.025
Their immune systems don't wait
for a disease to attack the body.

31:43.234 --> 31:45.944
lt would seek out an airborne virus
and destroy it.

31:46.154 --> 31:48.614
Destroy it? How exactly?

31:49.407 --> 31:55.412
The antibody would adapt itself
to alter the genetic code of the virus.

31:56.039 --> 31:59.374
Commander,
l want an analysis of the interaction

31:59.584 --> 32:02.169
between the Thelusian flu
and the children.

32:02.378 --> 32:03.962
On a molecular genetic level?

32:04.172 --> 32:05.797
Oh, we don't have time for that.

32:06.007 --> 32:08.508
A genetic analysis
could take months.

32:08.718 --> 32:10.052
Not necessarily.

32:10.261 --> 32:14.264
Commander Data
has a way with computers.

32:14.682 --> 32:18.018
Sorry, Picard, we erased
Dr. Pulaski's transporter pattern

32:18.227 --> 32:19.561
right after she transferred.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.897
Not that she used
the transporter much.

32:22.106 --> 32:23.815
She preferred the shuttlecraft.

32:24.025 --> 32:27.110
l would have given her a shuttle
if it would have kept her here.

32:27.737 --> 32:30.822
Tell me, Taggert,
if she served you as well as you say,

32:31.032 --> 32:33.158
why did you let her go?

32:34.077 --> 32:36.787
I see you haven't run into
her stubborn streak yet.

32:37.538 --> 32:40.666
As soon as she found out
about an opening on the Enterprise,

32:40.875 --> 32:42.709
she put in a request for transfer.

32:42.919 --> 32:45.629
Knew your service record
backward and forward.

32:45.838 --> 32:49.633
Apparently, she's been an admirer
of yours for some time.

32:50.593 --> 32:52.260
Extraordinary.

32:52.971 --> 32:57.182
Commander, what have you got?

32:57.809 --> 32:59.768
The answer, l believe, doctor.

32:59.978 --> 33:02.646
The Lantree was not the source
of the disease,

33:02.855 --> 33:04.398
but it was the trigger.

33:04.607 --> 33:05.691
Trigger?

33:05.900 --> 33:08.735
The Lantree's first officer
exposed your children

33:08.945 --> 33:10.779
to Thelusian flu for the first time.

33:10.989 --> 33:14.449
Their active immune systems
set out to attack the virus,

33:14.659 --> 33:16.994
and once it was triggered,
it kept going.

33:17.203 --> 33:20.497
But the antibody created
an unexpected side effect.

33:21.833 --> 33:25.210
lt alters the genetic makeup
of normal humans.

33:25.420 --> 33:28.588
This is a comparison
of the altered and normal DNA.

33:28.798 --> 33:31.550
These are the two molecules
that have been transposed.

33:31.759 --> 33:37.305
And since our DNA is self-replicating,
the process...

33:37.515 --> 33:38.932
ls irreversible.

33:40.768 --> 33:43.311
Judging from what happened
on the Lantree,

33:43.521 --> 33:48.233
anyone is a carrier
once they're infected.

33:52.697 --> 33:53.989
[GROANS]

34:00.455 --> 34:02.205
Have you made any progress,
doctor?

34:02.415 --> 34:04.124
l'm afraid so, captain.

34:04.333 --> 34:07.252
The children don't carry the disease.
They are the cause.

34:07.879 --> 34:08.962
What do you mean?

34:09.172 --> 34:11.965
Their advanced immune system
has created an antibody

34:12.175 --> 34:13.717
that changes normal DNA.

34:13.926 --> 34:17.512
The altered genes
are the ones that control aging.

34:17.722 --> 34:20.682
Then why did it attack you
more quickly than Dr. Kingsley?

34:20.892 --> 34:23.310
The enclosed environment
of the shuttlecraft

34:23.519 --> 34:25.479
concentrated my exposure.

34:25.688 --> 34:29.775
The Lantree's first officer
carried the antibody onto his ship.

34:29.984 --> 34:32.194
lt had the same effect on his crew.

34:32.403 --> 34:33.945
Right. What's the next step?

34:34.572 --> 34:35.822
The children will survive,

34:36.032 --> 34:40.035
but the rest of us
are just about out of time.

34:48.336 --> 34:50.045
Doctor,
l want you back aboard this ship.

34:50.254 --> 34:52.672
We'll beam you up
in suspended animation like the boy.

34:52.882 --> 34:56.134
- That will give us more time.
- I appreciate what you're trying to do,

34:56.344 --> 34:58.136
but l got into this
by leaping before l looked

34:58.346 --> 35:00.806
and I won't allow you
to make the same mistake.

35:06.562 --> 35:08.647
Chief medical officer's log,

35:08.856 --> 35:11.775
this will be my final report
to the Enterprise.

35:12.568 --> 35:16.738
Just as changes in evolution
are known to be caused

35:16.948 --> 35:18.365
by changes in the environment,

35:18.574 --> 35:21.493
we now know the process
also works in reverse.

35:22.787 --> 35:27.040
An attempt to control human evolution
has resulted in a new species

35:27.250 --> 35:29.960
that's lethal to its predecessors.

35:30.169 --> 35:34.422
The children will be condemned
to live out their lives in isolation.

35:35.216 --> 35:40.345
The quarantine of the Darwin Station
must be maintained forever.

35:51.315 --> 35:53.900
l am sorry
l could not be more helpful, doctor.

35:54.110 --> 35:56.820
You did everything you could,
commander.

35:57.321 --> 36:01.491
As androids go,
you're in a class by yourself.

36:04.078 --> 36:05.787
- Doctor...
PULASKl: Please.

36:06.706 --> 36:08.999
Give my best to the captain.

36:13.129 --> 36:17.716
Enterprise, Commander Data,
ready to beam aboard.

36:28.394 --> 36:32.230
Captain,
Kate knew what she was doing.

36:33.149 --> 36:35.734
l wish l could be certain
that we'd tried everything.

36:37.028 --> 36:39.321
Commander Data
is ready to come aboard, sir.

36:44.368 --> 36:46.661
You have the Bridge, Number One.

37:00.384 --> 37:02.427
No life forms present, sir.

37:06.015 --> 37:07.933
O'BRlEN:
You may step down, sir.

37:10.561 --> 37:13.063
Data, tell me. lf--

37:13.272 --> 37:15.273
- lt's good to see you again.
- Thank you, sir.

37:15.483 --> 37:19.027
Now, quickly. lf the changes
in Dr. Pulaski's DNA were reversed,

37:19.237 --> 37:20.946
- would it be--
- lt is not reversible, sir.

37:21.155 --> 37:22.697
The subtle molecular
transposition of--

37:22.907 --> 37:26.701
Yes, yes, yes, but, say, if it were
undone, would she be normal again?

37:27.536 --> 37:29.412
As normal as ever, sir.

37:29.622 --> 37:31.706
You said that the transporter
could be modified

37:31.916 --> 37:34.876
to filter out the changes
in Dr. Pulaski.

37:35.086 --> 37:37.963
Yes, sir, but we were unable
to locate her trace pattern.

37:38.172 --> 37:42.592
Well, what if we used a sample
of her DNA,

37:42.802 --> 37:48.014
say from a blood test taken before
she was exposed to the disease?

37:48.224 --> 37:51.101
Could that be used to filter out
the genetic changes?

37:51.310 --> 37:53.687
Well, l'd have to get
into the biofilter buss

37:53.896 --> 37:55.647
and patch in
a molecular matrix reader.

37:55.856 --> 37:56.898
That's no problem.

37:57.108 --> 37:59.192
But the waveform modulator
will be overloaded

37:59.402 --> 38:02.279
without the regeneration limiter
in the first-stage circuit.

38:02.488 --> 38:04.906
- lnteresting. However, theoretically...
- Data.

38:05.116 --> 38:06.825
- Yes, sir.
- Can you do the modifications?

38:07.034 --> 38:09.869
- l think so, sir.
- Then make it so.

38:10.663 --> 38:13.331
You heard what he said.
Let's get those panels off.

38:19.672 --> 38:21.214
A blood test, a tissue sample.

38:21.424 --> 38:24.426
Anything that would have a sample
of Dr. Pulaski's original DNA.

38:24.635 --> 38:27.679
No, sir. Her records were shipped
by way of Starfleet headquarters.

38:27.888 --> 38:29.389
They have not caught up
with us yet.

38:29.598 --> 38:31.099
This is ridiculous.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.393
A cell, a single cell.

38:33.602 --> 38:35.603
Let's check her quarters.

38:49.577 --> 38:53.747
- Anything. A fingernail, a hair--
- Hairbrush.

39:06.052 --> 39:09.179
DATA:
lt has a follicle, sir. Live cells.

39:13.225 --> 39:15.935
Darwin Station,
this is the Enterprise.

39:16.145 --> 39:19.314
PULASKl:
Go ahead, captain. l'm here.

39:25.905 --> 39:27.739
PlCARD:
Doctor, we may have a solution.

39:27.948 --> 39:31.201
We have a sample
of your normal DNA

39:31.410 --> 39:33.286
to use as a filter in the transporter.

39:33.496 --> 39:36.581
We think
that we can beam you aboard

39:36.791 --> 39:42.712
while filtering out any of the genetic
problems caused by the disease.

39:42.922 --> 39:45.715
Interesting theory, captain.

39:45.925 --> 39:49.803
lf it works,
we could use the same technique

39:50.012 --> 39:53.556
to save Dr. Kingsley
and her colleagues.

39:54.600 --> 39:58.478
l think you should know
this has never been attempted before.

39:58.687 --> 40:00.188
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

40:01.023 --> 40:03.483
lf l live through this...

40:05.194 --> 40:09.489
...l'll have a much better
understanding of geriatrics.

40:14.870 --> 40:16.704
PlCARD: All set, chief?
O'BRlEN: Almost ready, sir.

40:16.914 --> 40:18.581
- There's just one thing.
- Yes?

40:19.083 --> 40:22.252
This modification's one way only.
lf it doesn't work,

40:22.461 --> 40:25.839
we won't be able to reverse-transport
the doctor back to the planet.

40:29.468 --> 40:34.681
Then l'll operate
the transporter controls myself.

40:34.890 --> 40:38.893
lf she's going to be consigned
to oblivion, then...

40:39.103 --> 40:40.854
Thank you, sir.

40:41.230 --> 40:43.398
l'll be monitoring the medical scans,

40:43.607 --> 40:47.861
but you'll be able to tell if it's worked
by watching the stack.

40:49.572 --> 40:51.906
Dr. Pulaski, are you ready?

40:52.658 --> 40:55.910
PULASKl:
l suppose l am, captain.

41:01.542 --> 41:03.376
Here we go.

41:14.054 --> 41:16.014
lt's not working.

41:16.932 --> 41:18.183
O'BRlEN:
Captain, wait.

41:50.424 --> 41:52.967
- Doctor.
- Good to see you, doctor.

41:53.427 --> 41:55.595
Welcome back, doctor.

41:56.138 --> 41:57.180
Come.

42:02.603 --> 42:05.563
Captain, if this hadn't worked, if...

42:05.773 --> 42:07.565
lf this hadn't worked,

42:07.775 --> 42:11.986
it would have been necessary
to beam your energy into empty space.

42:12.196 --> 42:15.615
And spread my atoms
across the galaxy.

42:15.824 --> 42:18.576
- Yes. l'm sorry.
- No, no, don't-- Don't be sorry.

42:18.786 --> 42:20.662
Every time l get into the damn thing,

42:20.871 --> 42:23.873
l'm convinced
that's what's going to happen.

42:29.547 --> 42:32.549
PULASKI: Chief medical officer's log,
supplemental.

42:32.758 --> 42:35.635
The adults of Darwin Station
have been restored to normal health

42:35.844 --> 42:37.512
using our transporter.

42:37.721 --> 42:40.890
They will remain on Gagarin lV
and continue their research

42:41.100 --> 42:44.519
in hopes of one day
rejoining their children.

42:44.728 --> 42:46.604
lmpulse speed.

42:48.023 --> 42:49.732
There she is, captain.

42:50.442 --> 42:53.278
PULASKI: Scientists believe
no experiment is a failure,

42:53.487 --> 42:57.198
that even a mistake advances
the evolution of understanding.

42:57.408 --> 42:59.242
Close to 40 kilometers.

42:59.743 --> 43:02.078
Forty kilometers. Aye, sir.

43:02.288 --> 43:04.706
But all achievement has a price.

43:04.915 --> 43:07.292
For one brief glimpse
at the mysterious blueprint

43:07.501 --> 43:08.626
of human evolution,

43:08.836 --> 43:12.630
the men and women of the
USS Lantree paid with their lives.

43:12.840 --> 43:18.219
Their sacrifice is thus noted
in this scientist's log.

43:19.263 --> 43:20.847
Number One.

43:21.682 --> 43:24.767
Lieutenant Worf,
arm the photon torpedoes.

43:27.563 --> 43:29.397
Torpedoes ready, commander.

43:29.898 --> 43:30.982
COMPUTER:
Extreme caution.

43:31.191 --> 43:33.735
The USS Lantree
is a quarantined vessel

43:33.944 --> 43:37.322
by order of Starfleet Command.
Do not board.

43:37.948 --> 43:39.407
Gentlemen.

43:40.242 --> 43:41.326
Extreme caution.

43:41.535 --> 43:43.703
The USS Lantree
is a quarantined vessel

43:43.912 --> 43:47.624
by order of Starfleet Command.
Do not board.

44:01.889 --> 44:05.266
Set course and speed
for Star Station lndia.

44:05.976 --> 44:08.436
WESLEY:
Course and speed set, sir.

44:14.818 --> 44:16.569
Engage.
