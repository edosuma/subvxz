00:15.895 --> 00:17.935
Well, I've got six here.

00:17.935 --> 00:19.815
You know, Claudia, I just feel

00:19.815 --> 00:22.495
it will have to be a bit fuller.
Perhaps some lilies.

00:22.495 --> 00:25.295
The band are not booked
until tomorrow, darling.

00:25.295 --> 00:27.455
I'm sorry, but you'll be in the way
here today.

00:27.455 --> 00:29.375
That's exactly what my fiancee said.

00:29.375 --> 00:31.135
I'm sorry?
I'm the groom.

00:31.135 --> 00:33.215
Of course!

00:33.215 --> 00:36.535
That's not what I ordered. If you
want something done here, Michael,

00:36.535 --> 00:38.375
you have to do it yourself.

00:38.375 --> 00:40.335
Oh!

00:43.695 --> 00:45.735
Just can not get the staff.

00:45.735 --> 00:47.775

It's me.

02:36.175 --> 02:38.135
I'm here.

02:45.135 --> 02:48.015
Ah. I was...

02:49.375 --> 02:51.415
..dreaming of home.

02:51.415 --> 02:53.455
How are you feeling?

02:53.455 --> 02:55.495
I'm dying.

02:55.495 --> 02:57.855
Apart from that, I'm fine.

03:04.415 --> 03:07.335
Matthew, this woman, Emily.
It's OK.

03:07.335 --> 03:09.295
You'll use her to catch Ethan?

03:09.295 --> 03:11.735
If it comes to that, yeah.
Are you sure?

03:12.775 --> 03:15.135
You haven't allowed yourself to get
too close?

03:15.135 --> 03:17.215
Don't worry.

03:17.215 --> 03:20.655
I'm not involved with her.
I'm not involved with anyone.

03:20.655 --> 03:23.335
I'm sorry, it's for your own good.

03:23.335 --> 03:25.975
For all our good.

03:29.655 --> 03:35.055
So, to sum up, we're looking for
a psychopath from Victorian England

03:35.055 --> 03:37.335
who can drive a car

03:37.335 --> 03:40.295
and seems perfectly at home
in the 21st century.

03:40.295 --> 03:42.455
Emily, you said he was from 1902.

03:42.455 --> 03:44.575
If so, perhaps he's got a police
record.

03:44.575 --> 03:46.615
I could do some digging around.

03:46.615 --> 03:49.495
OK, Becker,
you track down this Ethan character.

03:51.175 --> 03:53.015
I'm not going back without Ethan.

03:53.015 --> 03:54.855
Ethan's not going anywhere.

03:54.855 --> 03:57.295
When we find him,
he's going straight to prison.

03:57.295 --> 04:00.455
I suggest you rejoin your friends
while you've still got the chance.

04:00.455 --> 04:02.455
It's her decision.

04:02.455 --> 04:04.215
She should stay if she wants.

04:05.695 --> 04:08.695
He's right, of course, but
if you do, I shall have to inform

04:08.695 --> 04:11.415
Philip and the minister.
What will that mean for me?

04:11.415 --> 04:14.775
It remains to be seen but I shan't
be able to protect you any longer.

04:14.775 --> 04:17.774
She should stay.
She's our only real link to Ethan.

04:18.975 --> 04:21.535
You'd better not let her
out of your sight, then.

04:23.575 --> 04:25.615

04:25.615 --> 04:27.695
We have an anomaly alert.

04:49.295 --> 04:52.335

05:04.415 --> 05:06.335
"I'm just loading the floor plans
now."

05:07.855 --> 05:09.815
Is this a drill?

05:16.015 --> 05:18.255
Still nothing, Jess.
Have you got visual?

05:18.255 --> 05:20.055
The anomaly is in the basement.

05:20.055 --> 05:22.415
There's an entrance
in the northwest corridor.

05:49.695 --> 05:52.255
Whoa. Did you hear that?

05:54.055 --> 05:56.015

07:07.535 --> 07:09.855

now? Huh?

07:09.855 --> 07:13.095
Is she just going to stay
at your place? No.

07:13.095 --> 07:16.055
Easy on the small talk, Matt.
We'll never get anything done (!)

07:17.335 --> 07:20.815
Must be strange for a woman from her
time, coming to the 21st century.

He was a notorious anarchist,

07:50.215 --> 07:52.015
thought to be from
Russia originally,

07:52.015 --> 07:53.895
though nobody seems very sure.

07:53.895 --> 07:55.935
He murdered at least half a dozen
people

07:55.935 --> 07:58.215
before disappearing without trace
in 1902.

07:58.215 --> 08:01.055
His MO was to take over a property
near his victim,

08:01.055 --> 08:04.175
watch them for days, then move in
and assassinate his target.

08:04.175 --> 08:07.815
That's how he knew Emily was alone.
Must have been watching Matt's flat.

08:07.815 --> 08:10.695
Run a security check
on all of Matt's neighbours.

08:10.695 --> 08:12.655
Ethan might still be nearby.

This is a joke, right?

Oh. I'm not a demanding bride.
Really, I'm not.

10:09.886 --> 10:11.966
It's going to be OK.

for a day or two,

10:15.206 --> 10:16.966

10:18.686 --> 10:22.086

of the property now

10:22.086 --> 10:24.446

while you get married.

She's happy.

Do you think she's told him?

about that mad PR firm
we used to work for.

So, Jenny's always been pretty
mysterious about her past.

11:59.006 --> 12:01.486
That's because my life didn't begin
until I met you.

12:02.886 --> 12:05.046
No, really. I'm interested.

12:06.166 --> 12:08.366
Oh, well, it was boring, really.

12:08.366 --> 12:11.006
Yeah, just work. 9:00 till 5:00,

How did you two meet? I bet there's
a funny story in there somewhere!

12:41.326 --> 12:43.286
We were introduced by friends.

12:47.886 --> 12:49.966
What was I meant to do?

12:49.966 --> 12:53.126
Sometimes it's easy to forget
that none of this is normal.

12:53.126 --> 12:55.206
You left me sitting there.

The only apartments

13:17.686 --> 13:20.326

are on the eighth floor.

surveillance operation outside."

With any luck, he won't know we're
on to him. (WHISTLES)

14:54.966 --> 14:57.286

Stay warm?

15:01.526 --> 15:04.086
What?!

15:04.086 --> 15:06.046
It's been difficult.

15:07.086 --> 15:09.126
You should just tell him.

15:09.126 --> 15:11.206
Do you think so?

15:11.206 --> 15:14.286
Do you know, when I met him, I just
wanted to have a fresh start.

15:14.286 --> 15:16.206
After everything that had happened,

15:16.206 --> 15:19.926
I just wanted to forget about
the anomalies and...Cutter.

I could just move on.

guys. I didn't forget any of you.

you know...ever go down
the road of...

Go down the road of complete...

15:47.486 --> 15:49.646

some more champagne.

15:53.726 --> 15:55.686
Connor, a word of advice.

15:58.166 --> 16:00.686
It's customary
to propose to the girl

16:00.686 --> 16:03.326
before you start planning
the wedding.

16:04.806 --> 16:06.766
Yeah.

16:18.886 --> 16:20.846
Jess, I'm in position.

16:20.846 --> 16:22.606
Can you patch me through the feeds

OK.

She stays with me.

"She stays with me"?
What is this, the 1800s?

16:52.686 --> 16:55.886
Just think it's time we all turned
in. Gosh, he's Mr Fun, isn't he?

16:55.886 --> 16:59.046
Must be a laugh a minute on the team
now. I'd love to come with you.

17:01.206 --> 17:03.646
Have fun. We will.

17:08.766 --> 17:10.806
Right.

my way home. I thought I'd drop by.

when you've seen what I've seen,

(GROWLS)

19:02.926 --> 19:05.246
Sorry to drag you out so late,
but I need to talk.

19:06.406 --> 19:09.606
Look, I know it sounds insane about
somebody I've only met once.

19:09.606 --> 19:12.246
And what do you think Ethan's
going to do?

19:13.366 --> 19:16.846
Whatever it is, you can trust me.

19:21.446 --> 19:23.486
OK.

19:23.486 --> 19:26.166
I didn't just fall into this job.

19:26.166 --> 19:28.406
I've been preparing
for it my whole life.

19:28.406 --> 19:30.286
I knew about the anomalies

19:30.286 --> 19:32.366
and I made sure I was the perfect
candidate.

19:32.366 --> 19:35.046
So you lied to everyone?
I had no choice.

19:36.446 --> 19:38.806
Something's going to happen
with the anomalies.

19:40.006 --> 19:41.966
What's going to happen?

19:43.166 --> 19:45.126
Tell me, please.

19:46.326 --> 19:48.366
I can't say any more.

19:48.366 --> 19:50.446
I've told you too much already.

19:50.446 --> 19:52.526
I'm sorry.

19:54.166 --> 19:56.126
Who are you?

19:57.166 --> 20:00.286
Just know I would never, ever do
anything to put you in any danger.

20:01.566 --> 20:03.486
Matt...
Come on.

20:24.966 --> 20:27.566
Damn it, he's in the house.
What? What happened?

20:27.566 --> 20:31.326
I'm going in. Call for backup.
Wait in the car.

20:32.326 --> 20:34.326
Backup needed.
Can we get a unit down here now?

22:02.870 --> 22:04.830

22:06.110 --> 22:08.070
Abby?

22:33.830 --> 22:35.790
Great.

Where are you?

23:28.710 --> 23:30.670
That's...not cool.

23:36.070 --> 23:38.110
No reception. Of course there isn't.

23:38.110 --> 23:40.070
Stay there.

23:42.830 --> 23:44.790
No.

23:45.950 --> 23:48.630
No.
(ROAR)

24:12.470 --> 24:14.590
Come on, don't you guys start
as well!

24:14.590 --> 24:16.590
Ow! Ow!

24:31.670 --> 24:33.630
Yeah?

24:39.710 --> 24:41.710
What's this? Go on.

24:43.150 --> 24:45.110
Eh?

24:49.710 --> 24:52.790
Go crazy, guys. This round's on me.

25:38.790 --> 25:42.150
Jess, Jess, don't shoot, don't
shoot, it's me. Don't move.

25:42.150 --> 25:44.190
This place is rigged with traps.

25:44.190 --> 25:46.950
Walk slowly that way. 
Yeah.

25:46.950 --> 25:50.230
Where's Ethan? Not here.
But he's left us a little gift.

25:51.350 --> 25:54.670
This pressure pad under my left
foot, attached to that metronome.

25:54.670 --> 25:56.750
And I think that's a bomb.

25:56.750 --> 25:58.710
If this counterweight
hits the floor,

25:58.710 --> 26:00.750
I think that detonates the bomb
as well.

26:00.750 --> 26:05.270
I need you to come over here
and tell me if I'm right.

26:05.270 --> 26:08.590
Come on.
OK. OK.

26:08.590 --> 26:10.710
And there's a trip wire there.
Be careful.

26:10.710 --> 26:14.110
Now, Jess, really, really gently,
pull that off.

26:17.030 --> 26:18.990
Oh, God.

26:20.310 --> 26:23.670
It could destroy the whole building.
You need to get out of here. Now!

26:23.670 --> 26:27.790
No, I - Go now! I'm not leaving you.
I'm not leaving you.

26:27.790 --> 26:30.350
He knew we were watching him!
You need to leave now!

26:30.350 --> 26:34.230
Becker, you tell me what to do.
You can tell me. Come on.

(SNORING)

27:00.630 --> 27:02.590
(ROAR)

27:11.350 --> 27:14.270
Go round the back of the bomb
and tell me what you can see.

27:14.270 --> 27:16.230
Erm...yeah. There's a black box.

27:16.230 --> 27:18.150
What's inside it?
Take the back off it.

27:20.230 --> 27:22.430
Tell me what you see.
OK, hang on.

27:23.550 --> 27:26.470
Erm...loads and loads of wires.

27:26.470 --> 27:29.430
There should be a small cylinder
in there - the detonator,

27:29.430 --> 27:33.390
with two wires, a red and a green
wire coming out the bottom of it.

27:33.390 --> 27:36.190
Oh! Don't touch anything!
Can you see that?

27:36.190 --> 27:38.670
Yes, I -
You're OK, you're OK. Breathe.

27:38.670 --> 27:40.830
OK.
You're doing brilliantly.

27:40.830 --> 27:42.910
Now, you can see the cylinder,
can you?

27:42.910 --> 27:44.990
Yes, I can see,
I can see a cylinder.

27:44.990 --> 27:47.150
Good. Now, I want you
to come over here.

27:47.150 --> 27:50.310
OK. There's a pair of pliers
on that table. Quickly, now. OK.

27:50.310 --> 27:53.190
Use those to very carefully
take out the red wire.

27:53.190 --> 27:55.230
Do not touch the green wire.

27:55.230 --> 27:57.270
OK. Red wire.

27:57.270 --> 27:59.670
OK. I can do this. Come on.

27:59.670 --> 28:02.830
Hurry, Jess. It's getting heavy.

28:02.830 --> 28:07.310
There's...there's no green wire.
It's just two red wires.

28:07.310 --> 28:09.350
Which do I pick?

28:09.350 --> 28:11.150
You get out now. I mean it, Jess.

28:11.150 --> 28:13.710
Just shut up! OK?
Just...just hang on.

28:13.710 --> 28:16.230
Just give me a second.
I can do this. OK?

28:17.470 --> 28:19.430
OK.

I know. I am!

I want you to search the area now.
Now! Come on!

No. My name is Ethan Dobrowski.

OK, Now I'm getting worried. It's not
like him to ignore me for this long.

nursing a really massive hangover.

36:50.643 --> 36:52.683
Actually, we're not married yet.

36:52.683 --> 36:54.643
A mere technicality.

37:07.323 --> 37:10.683
Well, it wouldn't be a real wedding
without a proper fight, would it?

37:13.243 --> 37:15.203
How was your wedding?

37:21.563 --> 37:25.083
All the creatures are back through
and the anomaly's been locked.

37:25.083 --> 37:27.043
Good work.

37:29.203 --> 37:31.243
Are you OK?

37:31.243 --> 37:33.203
Fine.

37:43.643 --> 37:45.603
OK.

37:47.563 --> 37:50.483
I used to work
for a secret Government agency.

37:50.483 --> 37:53.403
We'd track anomalies, which are,
like, gateways in time

37:53.403 --> 37:55.363
to the past, the future,

37:55.363 --> 37:58.883
and sometimes, creatures could pass
through them into our world.

37:58.883 --> 38:00.923
It's dangerous.

38:00.923 --> 38:02.883
Fatal, in fact.

38:03.923 --> 38:07.083
There was a man that I was
in love with who was killed.

38:07.083 --> 38:10.403
There's also the possibility that I
could have been somebody else

38:10.403 --> 38:12.883
in a different time line,
called Claudia Brown.

38:12.883 --> 38:15.643
But then the present changed
and I became Jennifer Lewis,

38:15.643 --> 38:18.043
that's even too bizarre for me
to comprehend.

38:18.043 --> 38:19.963
So anyway, that's it,
the whole truth.

38:19.963 --> 38:21.923
What do you think?

38:23.603 --> 38:27.123
So this...other guy.

38:27.123 --> 38:29.163
You're over him, right?

38:29.163 --> 38:32.203
Yes. I'm over him.

38:33.883 --> 38:35.843
Well, that's OK, then.

38:39.883 --> 38:42.163
We do have one problem, though.

38:43.203 --> 38:45.563
The registrar's in no condition
to marry anyone.

38:49.483 --> 38:52.123
I think I might be able
to do something about that.

38:55.723 --> 38:58.803
"By the power vested in me,

38:58.803 --> 39:01.643

from the minister,

I now have the pleasure
of pronouncing you man and wife."

39:11.283 --> 39:13.123
"You may now kiss the bride

39:13.123 --> 39:15.963
or whatever it is that's customary
on these occasions."

39:15.963 --> 39:18.163
Forgive me, I'm a little bit vague
on the detail.

39:18.163 --> 39:20.123
"Thank you, James."

39:25.163 --> 39:27.123
It's so lovely!

39:35.683 --> 39:37.643
Whoo!

39:58.523 --> 40:01.803
I didn't love my husband.
I barely knew him.

40:02.843 --> 40:05.443
My family had money, he had a title.

40:05.443 --> 40:09.003
My father arranged the whole thing.
It was a very good match.

40:10.003 --> 40:11.963
For everyone except you.

40:13.883 --> 40:15.923
I have to be somewhere.

40:15.923 --> 40:17.883
Like to come?

40:32.443 --> 40:34.403
Did you catch Ethan?

40:36.243 --> 40:38.243
Have you found out how he's going
to do it?

40:41.083 --> 40:43.123
Not yet, but I will.

40:43.123 --> 40:45.163
Emily?

40:45.163 --> 40:47.203
She's here?

40:48.243 --> 40:50.483
Yeah. But don't worry.

40:50.483 --> 40:53.723
I'm going to use her to catch Ethan
and then I'm going to walk away.

40:53.723 --> 40:55.723
She means nothing to me.

40:55.723 --> 40:57.803
You and I aren't important.

40:57.803 --> 41:00.483
All that matters
is what we came here to do.

41:02.803 --> 41:04.763
It's all up to you now.

41:06.883 --> 41:08.843
I wish...

41:12.243 --> 41:14.203
I wish...

41:50.123 --> 41:52.163
He's gone.

41:52.163 --> 41:54.123
I'm sorry.

41:55.163 --> 41:57.123
Who was he?

41:58.523 --> 42:00.483
My father.

42:03.883 --> 42:06.043
Looks like 1870-ish.

42:06.043 --> 42:08.243
I think we've found an anomaly
back to your time.

42:08.243 --> 42:10.123
I thought this would be good news?

42:11.723 --> 42:15.643
Connor, then your calculator
is only a few million years out?

42:15.643 --> 42:18.803
Jess! Ethan has a way to track
anomalies. Warn the others.

42:20.003 --> 42:22.003
I've thought about killing you
every day.

42:24.003 --> 42:27.123
What the... I did some projections
of what would happen

42:27.123 --> 42:29.123
if the anomalies kept growing
at this rate.

42:29.123 --> 42:30.963
What will happen?

42:30.963 --> 42:32.803
It would be catastrophic.
