00:16.720 --> 00:18.397
<i>Kettle's on, Chloe.</i>

00:18.510 --> 00:22.338
<i>Nothing like a cup of chamomile
and a hot shower to relax you.</i>

00:22.640 --> 00:25.882
<i>Thanks, Lois. I feel better already.</i>

00:45.740 --> 00:47.518
Great.

00:47.545 --> 00:49.949
And my night is complete.

00:51.805 --> 00:54.704
Bet the lights aren't out in Metropolis.

00:56.725 --> 01:00.432
Lois, do you have a candle?

01:00.765 --> 01:03.755
Look in the little cabinet,
bottom drawer.

01:33.305 --> 01:35.153
<i>Help me.</i>

01:37.175 --> 01:39.205
Chloe.

01:41.015 --> 01:42.661
Chloe?

01:48.695 --> 01:50.079
Help me.

02:51.380 --> 02:55.046
Lois. Where's Chloe? Is she all right?

02:55.380 --> 02:58.329
That's what we were
just trying to determine. And you are?

02:59.050 --> 03:01.494
- Clark Kent.
- How do you do? I'm Dr. Sydell.

03:01.970 --> 03:04.586
He's Chloe's psychiatrist.

03:05.180 --> 03:08.473
Clark, I found her on the bathroom floor.
She cut her wrists.

03:09.400 --> 03:11.541
- What?
- I feel so guilty.

03:11.650 --> 03:13.246
I should have seen it coming.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.208
She hasn't been getting much sleep...

03:16.320 --> 03:18.936
between school
and her job at the <i>Planet</i> and...

03:19.030 --> 03:23.201
- Is there any history of mental illness?
- No. I'm her cousin.

03:23.265 --> 03:26.164
- I'd know if there are bats in the belfry.
- Fine.

03:26.265 --> 03:29.931
Well, that'll give us
something to start with. Orderly.

03:30.225 --> 03:33.215
Would you take Miss Sullivan
from the ER to room 258, please.

03:33.315 --> 03:35.921
- Make sure she's comfortable.
- Yes, sir.

03:37.065 --> 03:40.146
Doctor, I don't understand,
why would Chloe do this to herself?

03:40.235 --> 03:41.922
It's a number of factors:

03:42.025 --> 03:45.530
Family history, stress,
loss of a loved one...

03:45.615 --> 03:49.574
Sometimes, a person has a secret
they feel they can't share.

03:50.375 --> 03:55.051
But whatever it is, I'll uncover it,
and I will treat it aggressively.

04:04.555 --> 04:06.191
Hey.

04:06.305 --> 04:07.992
Hey.

04:09.475 --> 04:11.323
How you doing?

04:11.435 --> 04:13.243
Out of it.

04:13.355 --> 04:15.628
From the sedatives they gave me.

04:19.445 --> 04:20.829
So, what happened?

04:22.945 --> 04:24.672
I don't know.

04:27.655 --> 04:32.503
- If you gotta talk about something...
- Clark, really, I don't know.

04:32.575 --> 04:37.383
I mean, I was showering and then
the lights went out and...

04:37.455 --> 04:38.849
It's just all jumbled.

04:39.375 --> 04:41.991
I just woke up on the floor bleeding.

04:45.465 --> 04:47.192
Clark, I'm a writer.

04:47.305 --> 04:51.436
If I was gonna kill myself,
I would leave one hell of a suicide note.

04:57.225 --> 05:00.891
I think there was someone else
in the room with me, though.

05:01.145 --> 05:02.963
Lois didn't see anyone.

05:07.985 --> 05:11.025
You know, Chloe, the doctor asked
if you had any history...

05:11.115 --> 05:13.266
of mental illness in your family.

05:13.915 --> 05:15.854
- Should we tell him about your mom?
- No.

05:15.955 --> 05:19.238
- Chloe, she...
- I don't know what's happening to me.

05:19.335 --> 05:22.284
But I don't want anyone
thinking I'm like my mom.

05:22.375 --> 05:24.991
So just don't say anything, all right?

05:28.885 --> 05:30.491
Yeah.

05:51.405 --> 05:52.839
On my way back to Metropolis.

05:52.955 --> 05:57.328
Didn't mean to interrupt, I just
thought I'd check on how you're doing.

05:57.415 --> 05:59.435
I do have a front door.

06:00.295 --> 06:03.830
Next time, I'll come to the front.

06:05.215 --> 06:06.649
Maybe you should call first.

06:09.505 --> 06:11.949
Yeah. Let me help you.

06:12.725 --> 06:14.654
Thank you.

06:16.935 --> 06:20.723
Budget, fiscal projections...

06:23.525 --> 06:24.959
public works.

06:25.065 --> 06:28.055
Everything a potential senator
would need to know.

06:28.155 --> 06:30.559
You considering taking his senate seat?

06:30.865 --> 06:33.855
I don't know. It's complicated.

06:38.915 --> 06:41.693
I know how hard it is...

06:42.205 --> 06:45.457
to get back any sense
of what's normal...

06:46.425 --> 06:48.233
after you lose someone you love.

06:54.095 --> 06:55.994
It will get easier, Martha.

07:01.395 --> 07:03.253
I know it will.

07:04.235 --> 07:06.720
You just have to give yourself time.

07:33.515 --> 07:35.575
Help me.

07:36.475 --> 07:38.535
Please.

07:39.725 --> 07:42.129
Help me.

07:51.565 --> 07:53.676
Please.

07:54.655 --> 07:57.180
I have to find him.

07:58.365 --> 07:59.759
Help me.

08:04.795 --> 08:06.563
Hello?

08:14.505 --> 08:15.899
Lana.

08:16.015 --> 08:18.288
I got here as fast as I could.
Everything okay?

08:18.385 --> 08:19.951
- Where is she?
- Who?

08:20.055 --> 08:22.418
The girl. She was just here.

08:24.435 --> 08:27.303
My God, there's so much blood.

08:32.695 --> 08:36.018
Chloe? Hey, we should get you
back to bed, all right?

08:36.115 --> 08:38.558
No, I have to find her. I just saw her.

08:39.575 --> 08:41.009
Where is she?

08:41.115 --> 08:42.721
Doctor. Doctor. Oh, my God.

08:42.825 --> 08:45.401
- A woman in my room needs your help.
- Relax. Orderly.

08:45.495 --> 08:48.323
- Listen. There's blood all over the floor.
- I'm listening.

08:48.415 --> 08:50.607
- It's going down the hall.
- There's no blood.

08:50.715 --> 08:52.270
- She was in my bathroom.
- Relax.

08:52.385 --> 08:54.950
- You're not listening! There's blood!
- I'm listening.

08:55.055 --> 08:57.954
- There's a woman, she needs my help!
- Nurse, take her arm.

08:58.055 --> 09:00.115
Listen to me, please!
Make him listen! No!

09:00.225 --> 09:03.215
- Lie back.
- No! Please, you don't understand!

09:03.305 --> 09:05.749
- She needs our help. No! Lana!
- Please.

09:05.855 --> 09:08.925
Make them listen! Lana! Please, Lana!

09:12.465 --> 09:16.636
How hard can it be to find
one college professor from a dirt state?

09:16.725 --> 09:18.200
I want Fine located...

09:18.305 --> 09:21.295
or" somebody's gonna be
wondering where you disappeared to.

09:24.395 --> 09:26.041
Lana.

09:29.195 --> 09:30.922
What's wrong?

09:32.865 --> 09:35.814
Chloe, she's in the hospital.

09:37.905 --> 09:39.299
She tried to kill herself.

09:40.415 --> 09:42.395
- Is she all right?
- I don't know.

09:42.495 --> 09:46.242
I tried talking to her, but she wasn't
making any sense. They sedated her.

09:48.045 --> 09:49.439
Who's her doctor?

09:49.545 --> 09:52.666
Some psychiatrist at the med center.

09:52.755 --> 09:55.623
That's actually why I came to see you.

09:56.425 --> 09:58.748
When you were in Belle Reve...

09:58.845 --> 10:02.552
the doctors helped you
when you were having problems, right?

10:04.265 --> 10:06.457
I'll make the call.

10:07.435 --> 10:11.233
She'll have the best doctors this side
of Vienna helping within the hour.

10:11.315 --> 10:14.396
Lex, thank you.
I didn't know who else to go to.

10:29.755 --> 10:31.270
Lex, what are you doing here?

10:32.175 --> 10:34.235
Lana came to see me.

10:34.345 --> 10:36.698
She told me what happened.

10:38.635 --> 10:41.211
Thanks for coming by,
but we have it under control.

10:41.805 --> 10:44.290
Clark, this is a local med center.

10:44.395 --> 10:46.839
If Chloe scraped her knee,
she'd be in good hands.

10:46.935 --> 10:50.137
But something like this requires
a more delicate touch.

10:50.895 --> 10:53.178
I'll make sure she gets
the best care possible.

10:55.905 --> 10:57.460
You're gonna transfer her?

10:57.985 --> 11:00.056
The helicopter is en route.

11:00.155 --> 11:02.852
She'll be in Belle Reve
before she wakes up.

11:02.955 --> 11:05.096
Chloe doesn't belong in Belle Reve.

11:05.205 --> 11:07.306
Lana thinks so.

11:09.665 --> 11:12.655
I know how much
you care about Chloe.

11:12.755 --> 11:16.835
A close friend, someone you trust
more than anyone else in the world...

11:16.925 --> 11:19.490
it's hard to see them like this.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.863
I'll take good care of her.

11:23.975 --> 11:25.914
I promise.

11:39.615 --> 11:42.059
What are you doing?
She should be in the hospital.

11:42.155 --> 11:45.104
Lex wanted to transfer her
to Belle Reve.

11:46.745 --> 11:49.947
Well, Clark, maybe that's
what she needs right now.

11:50.045 --> 11:52.186
Lois, you don't know
what goes on in there.

11:52.295 --> 11:55.153
You want Lex and his doctors
getting inside Chloe's head?

11:55.255 --> 11:59.133
If it makes her better, I don't care
if Daffy Duck whacks her with a mallet.

11:59.215 --> 12:03.265
You guys, I'm drugged, I'm not deaf.

12:06.395 --> 12:08.829
Hey. How you feeling?

12:09.305 --> 12:12.002
- Thirsty.
- I'll get you some water.

12:12.105 --> 12:17.155
Actually, can I just get a cappuccino?
I think it might help clear the cobwebs.

12:17.775 --> 12:20.684
I'll go downstairs
and whip you up a double.

12:21.445 --> 12:24.606
Can you not do anything ridiculous
for five minutes?

12:27.665 --> 12:31.705
- Not too happy about the breakout, huh?
- Yeah.

12:31.795 --> 12:34.865
She's just worried about you.
We all are.

12:36.045 --> 12:38.025
Clark, I know what I saw.

12:38.135 --> 12:40.448
I didn't imagine anything.

12:40.795 --> 12:44.340
And I didn't hurt myself,
I wouldn't do that.

12:44.425 --> 12:46.455
I'm not my mother.

12:48.395 --> 12:50.496
I know.

12:50.605 --> 12:52.958
I have to find him.

12:53.065 --> 12:56.984
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

12:58.775 --> 13:00.583
Help me.

13:01.445 --> 13:04.687
- I have to find him.
- She's here.

13:19.505 --> 13:21.778
Chloe, you okay?

13:21.885 --> 13:24.491
- She's in the wall.
- Who?

13:24.595 --> 13:27.585
The girl I keep seeing.
We have to help her.

13:27.675 --> 13:31.129
Chloe, look, just calm down, all right?
We'll get her out of the wall.

13:31.225 --> 13:33.336
No, Clark. No, Clark!
Clark, I'm not crazy.

13:33.725 --> 13:36.169
She's in the wall. Please, just look.

13:36.735 --> 13:38.503
Please.

13:52.125 --> 13:53.973
Oh, my God.

13:54.795 --> 13:56.138
What...?

14:09.095 --> 14:12.085
Clark. Clark.

14:38.665 --> 14:40.857
Yes, it was in the bathroom wall.

14:40.965 --> 14:43.238
No, I don't know
how long it's been there.

14:43.335 --> 14:44.981
No, this is not a prank.

14:45.095 --> 14:47.620
Would you just send the sheriff over?

14:47.715 --> 14:49.533
The sheriff?

14:49.635 --> 14:51.574
Clark, what did you do now?

14:51.685 --> 14:54.584
- Lois.
- I can't believe this. What...?

14:55.605 --> 14:57.373
Holy crap.

15:00.395 --> 15:02.213
What...?

15:04.615 --> 15:08.019
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

15:12.575 --> 15:14.221
I feel much better now.

15:22.875 --> 15:25.491
Maybe what you saw
wasn't in your head.

15:25.585 --> 15:28.241
Maybe this girl's spirit was
trying to contact you.

15:28.345 --> 15:31.628
When lightening hit the Talon
it must have jumped-started her body.

15:31.725 --> 15:33.998
Not to mention
the kryptonite in her bracelet.

15:36.015 --> 15:38.035
Yeah, the krypto-thing.

15:40.275 --> 15:45.456
That poor girl, sealed up in that wall
all that time, all alone.

15:46.445 --> 15:50.323
- I just hope she didn't suffer.
- Well, I think she did.

15:50.785 --> 15:52.421
A lot.

15:58.125 --> 15:59.933
That's good.

16:02.705 --> 16:05.786
- You should get some rest.
- No, I've slept enough.

16:05.875 --> 16:07.562
We need to find him.

16:09.425 --> 16:11.021
Find who?

16:11.135 --> 16:15.226
The man who did this.
He needs to suffer like she did.

16:19.435 --> 16:21.081
Why don't you try to go to sleep?

16:21.185 --> 16:23.205
We'll talk about this in the morning.

16:43.795 --> 16:45.684
Her name was Gretchen Winters.

16:45.795 --> 16:48.865
The police don't have any leads
on who put her behind the wall?

16:48.965 --> 16:52.540
The new sheriff's a little green.
But Gretchen is not the only girl...

16:52.635 --> 16:55.079
they found on the wrong side
of some drywall.

16:55.555 --> 16:57.575
Chloe should hear this.

17:00.515 --> 17:02.121
Chloe.

17:06.185 --> 17:07.963
Where'd she go?

17:36.475 --> 17:38.152
Chloe.

17:39.385 --> 17:41.324
Hey, roomie.

17:41.435 --> 17:45.142
Where have you been? Lex and I
have been looking for you all night.

17:45.225 --> 17:46.912
I just...

17:47.025 --> 17:50.641
I had some stuff that I had to get to.
Can I borrow this?

17:51.865 --> 17:53.380
That's yours.

17:57.495 --> 17:59.303
I've got some pretty cool stuff.

18:01.785 --> 18:05.785
- See you around.
- Chloe, wait. Where are you going?

18:10.425 --> 18:12.233
Sorry.

18:12.965 --> 18:16.379
- Where do you think you're going?
- Why does everyone keep asking that?

18:16.465 --> 18:19.333
- Because we're worried about you.
- Don't be, I'm fine.

18:19.425 --> 18:23.394
I know you may think you're better,
but it's just a trick your mind's playing.

18:23.475 --> 18:25.495
- You need help.
- No.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.837
What I need is for you
to move out of my way.

18:28.275 --> 18:30.921
I'm sorry,
but I'm taking you to Belle Reve.

18:40.535 --> 18:42.262
What happened?

18:44.375 --> 18:47.870
You tell me. How did Chloe
get out of her restraints at the hospital?

18:48.505 --> 18:50.353
Chloe was here? Where'd she go?

18:50.755 --> 18:52.947
I don't know,
but she was a different person.

18:53.045 --> 18:56.540
Now she's out there with a weapon
when she should be getting help.

18:56.635 --> 18:58.110
Nice work.

19:04.145 --> 19:06.710
I told you she should have
stayed at the hospital.

19:06.815 --> 19:08.915
<i>I'll see if Chloe's been to the</i> Planet.

19:08.935 --> 19:13.187
Okay, fine. Fine.
I'll call you if she shows up, all right?

19:14.695 --> 19:16.382
Sorry. I was just about to knock.

19:17.615 --> 19:20.059
- Do I know you?
- Yeah.

19:20.155 --> 19:23.862
We did a pass-by at the hospital
when they brought your cousin. Michael.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.220
Right, the nurse.

19:27.875 --> 19:30.824
Orderly, actually.
Nurse is a whole other thing.

19:32.045 --> 19:36.469
Excuse me. I'm just trying to do
a little aura cleansing.

19:39.255 --> 19:42.588
- Have you seen Chloe?
- No, I haven't.

19:44.265 --> 19:46.790
I didn't know that orderlies
made house calls.

19:47.685 --> 19:51.139
She just seemed
like a really sweet girl.

19:51.225 --> 19:55.821
I wanna make sure she gets help
before something bad happens.

19:57.945 --> 20:00.763
Well, I'll call Dr. Sydell
if I hear from her.

20:11.205 --> 20:13.185
What are you looking at?

20:15.505 --> 20:17.525
Oh, nothing.

20:17.795 --> 20:21.088
My dad used to run this place,
back when it was a movie theater.

20:21.175 --> 20:25.387
I haven't been up here in, God,
must be going on 10 years now.

20:26.685 --> 20:28.372
Ten years.

20:29.395 --> 20:32.344
Looks a lot nicer. Smells better too.

20:33.435 --> 20:35.920
Miracle of the aura-cleansing sage.

20:36.275 --> 20:39.093
Speaking of which,
I should probably get back to my thing.

20:39.195 --> 20:41.255
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

20:41.615 --> 20:44.857
If you see her, will you tell her
I was asking about her?

20:44.955 --> 20:47.228
- Sure.
- Good. Thanks.

20:47.325 --> 20:49.143
No problem.

20:58.425 --> 21:01.122
Come on. Come on.

21:07.305 --> 21:10.386
No, don't. Don't, don't.
Don't fight. It's okay.

21:10.475 --> 21:13.172
Smallville sheriff station.

21:13.275 --> 21:15.043
Hello?

21:16.145 --> 21:17.751
Hello.

22:12.955 --> 22:15.359
- Michael.
- Miss Sullivan.

22:15.915 --> 22:18.359
I'm sorry,
I didn't know where else to go.

22:18.465 --> 22:19.849
I need your help.

22:21.835 --> 22:24.956
Of course I'll help you.
Please, come in.

22:32.305 --> 22:35.426
I know things probably seem
pretty bad right now...

22:35.515 --> 22:37.586
but it's gonna be all right.

22:37.685 --> 22:39.200
I'll help you.

22:41.235 --> 22:43.215
Like you did with Gretchen?

22:45.575 --> 22:48.777
- Who?
- Gretchen Winters.

22:49.035 --> 22:50.419
You remember her, don't you?

22:51.915 --> 22:53.551
You were so nice to her at first.

22:53.665 --> 22:57.665
You gave her a pretty green bracelet
and you held her when she cried...

22:57.745 --> 22:59.856
and you listened
to all her problems...

22:59.955 --> 23:02.995
all the things
that were tearing her up inside.

23:03.675 --> 23:06.281
And then you told her your problems...

23:06.965 --> 23:09.076
and it made her sick!

23:11.175 --> 23:13.791
And she tried to leave,
but you wouldn't let her go!

23:13.895 --> 23:16.885
- And you grabbed a knife...
- How could you know that?

23:19.275 --> 23:20.699
No one can.

23:21.485 --> 23:23.970
Except you and Gretchen.

23:24.065 --> 23:26.802
She didn't deserve to die like that,
you son of a bitch!

23:28.275 --> 23:33.042
You're very ill, Miss Sullivan.
That's why you're talking like this.

23:36.165 --> 23:39.700
But don't worry, I can help.

23:45.835 --> 23:49.168
This is gonna hurt just a little bit.

23:49.675 --> 23:51.695
This is gonna hurt a lot.

24:01.435 --> 24:03.122
Help!

24:03.235 --> 24:04.871
Help me!

24:04.985 --> 24:06.924
Is somebody up there?

24:38.645 --> 24:41.503
Chloe. We have to get out of here.

24:41.605 --> 24:44.009
The orderly from the hospital
killed that girl.

24:44.145 --> 24:45.832
I know. It's okay.

24:45.945 --> 24:48.218
He's not gonna hurt anyone again.

24:49.155 --> 24:50.791
Chloe!

24:57.865 --> 25:00.016
Time for your treatment, ladies.

25:08.885 --> 25:10.562
Does it hurt?

25:14.515 --> 25:17.252
Feel like you wanna
do something wrong to yourself...

25:17.345 --> 25:19.365
even though you deserve it?

25:22.815 --> 25:24.663
Let them go.

25:26.355 --> 25:27.830
"Them"?

25:28.485 --> 25:30.333
Disassociated.

25:30.485 --> 25:32.677
Removed from what's happening.

25:33.405 --> 25:34.799
You really are sick.

25:36.035 --> 25:37.469
Look who's talking.

25:41.245 --> 25:43.942
There are things that squirm
just beneath the skin.

25:45.625 --> 25:47.180
But I can make them stop.

25:48.835 --> 25:51.411
Hey! Get the hell away from her!

25:54.595 --> 25:57.413
I'm just trying to help
before she ends up in an asylum...

25:57.555 --> 25:58.818
like her mother.

26:00.185 --> 26:02.033
Her mother?

26:05.475 --> 26:08.010
It was one of her squirmy things.

26:08.645 --> 26:11.049
She didn't even tell her doctor.

26:11.815 --> 26:14.391
But I get inside my girls.

26:15.235 --> 26:17.467
I find out things.

26:20.075 --> 26:22.600
My father used to make these.

26:25.125 --> 26:27.529
He was very good with his hands.

26:29.875 --> 26:32.451
I'd just sit for hours and watch him.

26:34.965 --> 26:37.662
While I watched,
he would tell me secrets...

26:38.635 --> 26:40.493
about my mother.

26:42.725 --> 26:44.917
She wasn't very nice.

26:46.725 --> 26:48.240
But he loved her.

26:51.025 --> 26:52.459
He helped her be at peace.

26:54.735 --> 26:56.674
I help my girls.

26:59.655 --> 27:02.271
I take their secrets...

27:06.585 --> 27:08.645
and they take mine.

27:09.665 --> 27:11.059
Forever.

27:15.255 --> 27:17.618
You always hurt the ones you love.

27:26.475 --> 27:28.455
It's not a secret.

27:31.565 --> 27:33.969
It's just something you have to learn.

27:44.495 --> 27:45.889
No, wait! Wait!

27:45.995 --> 27:47.934
- Wait, I'm sorry!
- So am I, sometimes.

27:48.035 --> 27:50.651
But we do what we have to
to get better.

27:51.455 --> 27:53.233
No! No!

27:56.385 --> 27:58.021
Take it.

27:58.675 --> 28:00.321
Take it!

28:05.265 --> 28:06.659
Slit your wrist.

28:07.855 --> 28:09.491
Screw you, shorty.

28:11.815 --> 28:14.885
Open your wrist
and release all your secrets.

28:14.985 --> 28:17.934
You can be at peace,
just like all of them.

28:20.575 --> 28:22.302
Or...

28:25.575 --> 28:27.767
you'll watch your cousin die.

28:31.245 --> 28:32.972
Do it!

29:10.665 --> 29:12.261
Do it.

29:12.545 --> 29:15.787
Or her pretty face
won't be so pretty anymore.

29:37.065 --> 29:39.257
Are all the women in
your family crazy?

29:42.525 --> 29:44.596
No! No!

29:59.085 --> 30:01.448
No, Mikey! Mikey! Mikey! Mikey.

30:01.585 --> 30:02.938
Mikey.

30:05.005 --> 30:06.439
What did you call me?

30:06.965 --> 30:11.561
Mikey. That's what your dad
used to call you, "little Mikey."

30:11.645 --> 30:14.291
Remember that? You hated it.

30:15.435 --> 30:16.829
How do you know so much?

30:21.155 --> 30:23.680
I know all your secrets, Mikey.

30:24.115 --> 30:25.883
It's me.

30:27.195 --> 30:29.175
It's Gretchen.

30:32.915 --> 30:34.683
Gretchen.

30:38.545 --> 30:40.696
I need you, Mikey.

30:42.505 --> 30:45.666
Please? I need you
to take away all my secrets.

30:46.755 --> 30:51.310
Make it stop hurting,
just like you did before. Please?

30:56.565 --> 30:58.838
Anything for my girl.

31:08.575 --> 31:10.726
Anything for my girl.

31:20.915 --> 31:24.369
No. What...? What are you doing?

31:25.215 --> 31:27.195
Gretchen, stop it.

31:52.955 --> 31:54.551
Chloe.

31:56.825 --> 31:59.481
- You okay?
- Yeah.

32:02.795 --> 32:04.350
What happened?

32:11.635 --> 32:14.584
I guess Gretchen got
what she came back for.

32:34.075 --> 32:35.590
Hey.

32:37.035 --> 32:38.510
Hey.

32:40.495 --> 32:42.525
Chloe told me what happened.

32:43.545 --> 32:46.030
- Yeah, how's she holding up?
- She's "okay..."

32:46.505 --> 32:49.030
considering that
she was possessed...

32:49.135 --> 32:52.630
and almost chopped up
by a psychotic orderly.

32:58.475 --> 33:00.414
Why didn't you tell me
you went to Lex?

33:01.145 --> 33:04.135
Why didn't you tell me you
broke Chloe out of the psych ward?

33:10.525 --> 33:13.101
We should have
come together, Clark.

33:13.195 --> 33:16.185
That's what couples do
when these things happen.

33:16.285 --> 33:17.840
They turn to each other.

33:19.075 --> 33:20.469
Why didn't we?

33:22.285 --> 33:24.315
I love you.

33:25.415 --> 33:28.203
I love you with all of my heart.

33:29.335 --> 33:30.860
But...

33:32.425 --> 33:34.738
I don't know
how to talk to you anymore.

33:41.805 --> 33:44.461
I guess we all have our secrets.

34:07.245 --> 34:10.315
- How's the tractor coming?
- I think I got it working.

34:10.415 --> 34:14.121
- I'm not as handy with tools as Dad was.
- I'm sure it's fine.

34:15.045 --> 34:17.105
There's an awful lot
of your father in you.

34:21.085 --> 34:22.690
I hope so.

34:28.554 --> 34:30.413
You really understand all that stuff?

34:31.935 --> 34:33.531
Most of it.

34:33.645 --> 34:37.725
Your mother was a corporate animal
once, as hard as that is to believe.

34:40.235 --> 34:41.750
It's not.

34:41.905 --> 34:46.329
I always thought you could do whatever
you wanted to if you put your mind to it.

34:48.495 --> 34:50.222
So did Dad.

34:59.295 --> 35:01.275
You should do it, Mom.

35:01.715 --> 35:04.573
You should take over Dad's
state Senate seat.

35:06.805 --> 35:08.865
I can't do that.

35:09.305 --> 35:10.951
Why not?

35:11.395 --> 35:14.001
Being a state senator
isn't a part-time job.

35:14.105 --> 35:17.307
I'd be gone all the time.
We have a farm to run.

35:17.395 --> 35:19.122
Mom, I can take over the farm.

35:19.895 --> 35:22.723
I think this is something
you really want to do.

35:23.775 --> 35:25.967
And I know it's what Dad
would have wanted.

35:29.325 --> 35:30.840
Well...

35:31.325 --> 35:34.779
I never was one
to disappoint a Kent boy.

35:55.225 --> 35:59.608
"Smallville serial killer commits suicide.
By Ted Biddleman."

35:59.685 --> 36:02.422
I can't even get a byline
when I'm a part of the story.

36:02.525 --> 36:05.474
- I'm just glad you're not in the obituaries.
- Yeah.

36:05.565 --> 36:08.060
Or wearing a straitjacket
at Belle Reve.

36:08.155 --> 36:10.215
I'd never let that happen.

36:15.495 --> 36:18.232
You know,
I had a couple of moments there...

36:18.335 --> 36:21.446
where I actually thought
I was losing my mind.

36:21.625 --> 36:26.342
I mean, I understand how Gretchen's
spirit was released and all that...

36:26.425 --> 36:29.839
but why was I
the only one that could see her?

36:29.925 --> 36:32.117
I mean, why did she choose me?

36:34.095 --> 36:37.842
Maybe because you care more about
other people than anyone else I know.

36:39.775 --> 36:43.058
Or maybe there really is
something wrong with me...

36:43.145 --> 36:44.832
like my mother.

36:48.025 --> 36:50.853
What is wrong
with your mother, exactly?

36:53.655 --> 36:55.433
I don't know.

36:57.325 --> 36:59.012
I mean...

36:59.125 --> 37:03.044
she left when I was 12,
so that was before...

37:03.465 --> 37:04.980
I don't know.

37:05.715 --> 37:07.270
But you do know where she is?

37:08.175 --> 37:09.609
Yeah.

37:12.175 --> 37:14.326
Why haven't you gone to see her?

37:18.855 --> 37:21.208
Well, because...

37:23.935 --> 37:26.006
Because I'm afraid.

37:26.405 --> 37:30.061
I mean, what if I look into her eyes
and I see myself?

37:33.365 --> 37:37.405
What if you wait too long and never get
the chance to look into her eyes again?

37:43.165 --> 37:44.983
She's your mother.

37:45.295 --> 37:48.497
She always will be. It's not
going to change, no matter what.

39:24.475 --> 39:25.869
Mom.
