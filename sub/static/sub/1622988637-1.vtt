00:45.054 --> 00:46.639
<i>Since the age of five,</i>

00:46.722 --> 00:51.310
<i>Ben Gibbon had been in 723 scrapes,
scuffles and brawls.</i>

00:52.395 --> 00:54.855
<i>An approximate 32.86 per year.</i>

00:55.856 --> 00:59.151
<i>And he lost every single one.</i>

01:00.152 --> 01:01.487
<i>With a record like that,</i>

01:01.570 --> 01:05.741
<i>his therapist determined
that he was actually trying to lose,</i>

01:05.825 --> 01:10.037
<i>and in truth, for Ben,
winning was never the point.</i>

01:11.122 --> 01:14.041
<i>It was more like a nagging sensation</i>

01:14.166 --> 01:16.836
<i>that he was floating
around inside his own brain,</i>

01:16.919 --> 01:20.756
<i>watching his life like it was a movie
where nothing happened.</i>

01:20.881 --> 01:24.593
<i>He could see it, but he couldn't feel it.</i>

01:24.677 --> 01:29.390
<i>So he was left with a violent need
to feel something.</i>

01:29.473 --> 01:30.891
- Hey!
- <i>Anything.</i>

01:30.975 --> 01:32.727
<i>Detached from reality</i>

01:32.810 --> 01:34.895
<i>and a captive audience
of his own movie,</i>

01:34.979 --> 01:37.481
<i>Ben searched out
increasingly disruptive ways</i>

01:37.565 --> 01:39.775
<i>of at least making it a crowd-pleaser.</i>

01:39.859 --> 01:44.238
<i>It was an aimless search,
rife with conflict and self-abasement.</i>

01:44.322 --> 01:47.408
<i>Until, without ever really knowing
what he was looking for,</i>

01:47.533 --> 01:49.785
<i>he found love.</i>

01:49.910 --> 01:51.579
Holy shit.

01:51.662 --> 01:55.958
<i>All at once, Ben's world came alive</i>

01:56.083 --> 02:00.338
<i>and he felt his life with an immediacy
he never thought possible.</i>

02:03.466 --> 02:08.012
<i>But then, just as suddenly
as it had appeared,</i>

02:08.095 --> 02:09.889
<i>it was gone.</i>

02:27.698 --> 02:30.034
<i>And just like that,</i>

02:30.117 --> 02:33.120
<i>Ben found himself
right back where he started.</i>

02:48.052 --> 02:49.887
Stay down, bitch.

02:58.479 --> 02:59.647
One moment.

03:06.779 --> 03:08.197
Mm.

03:10.699 --> 03:12.284
Oh, fuck, fellas.

03:17.581 --> 03:19.291
Still beating.

03:19.375 --> 03:20.376
Son of a...

03:54.452 --> 03:56.120
Why are we going to this, again?

03:57.121 --> 03:58.372
It's gonna be fun.

04:00.166 --> 04:01.375
It will not be fun.

04:04.211 --> 04:06.130
You sure it's not
because you heard she's back?

04:06.213 --> 04:07.590
I doubt she'll be there.

04:11.719 --> 04:13.012
It's her house.

04:26.108 --> 04:28.486
We're not even invited
to this thing, are we?

04:28.569 --> 04:29.528
Nope.

04:30.529 --> 04:32.239
<i>Mukul's concern was justified,</i>

04:32.364 --> 04:35.826
<i>as Ben had a reputation
for terrorizing high society events.</i>

04:37.369 --> 04:41.499
<i>In fact, after a recent string
of flagrant infractions,</i>

04:41.582 --> 04:44.710
<i>a newly minted restraining order
made the point loud and clear.</i>

04:44.793 --> 04:49.673
<i>Ben Gibbon was very much not welcome.</i>

05:05.856 --> 05:07.691
- Uh, Mom's coming.
- Benjamin.

05:07.775 --> 05:10.027
- Oh, my God. What are you doing here?
- Hey, Mom.

05:10.110 --> 05:12.404
Free booze. Thank you, perfect timing.

05:12.488 --> 05:14.406
- Thank you.
- Come with me.

05:14.490 --> 05:16.784
You do realize that you
were banned from these events.

05:16.867 --> 05:18.494
Ma, it's water under the bridge.

05:18.577 --> 05:20.120
You punched the president
of the Exeter Club,

05:20.204 --> 05:22.915
- urinated on the carpet.
- Yeah, yeah. We get it, we get it.

05:22.998 --> 05:25.417
Why can't you keep him
under control, Mukul?

05:25.501 --> 05:27.795
Your son's an anarchist, Mrs. Gibbon.

05:27.878 --> 05:30.130
- He's a Democrat.
- What's that?

05:30.214 --> 05:32.466
Uh, Mom, they're bruises,
they don't come off.

05:32.550 --> 05:33.884
Have you two been smoking dope?

05:33.968 --> 05:34.885
- Yeah.
- No.

05:34.969 --> 05:36.303
- Son.
- There's your father.

05:36.387 --> 05:38.055
- Batman.
- That's the man.

05:39.390 --> 05:41.725
What? It's really good.

05:41.809 --> 05:45.688
Mm-hmm. If William
and Beatrice see him here,

05:45.813 --> 05:48.023
it's gonna make an already
uncomfortable situation...

05:48.148 --> 05:50.150
My eyes must be deceiving me.

05:53.529 --> 05:55.281
Not much for appearances, are we?

05:55.364 --> 05:57.491
Just a little scuffle,
you know how boys are.

05:57.575 --> 05:59.410
That's not the point.

05:59.493 --> 06:01.704
Your son is trespassing.

06:01.787 --> 06:06.083
I'll keep a close eye on him and he's
going to behave himself. Right, Benjamin?

06:06.166 --> 06:08.127
Hmm?

06:12.339 --> 06:13.507
Thank you.

06:13.632 --> 06:15.467
Do I need
to call the authorities?

06:21.682 --> 06:23.934
Can you try to not look so miserable?

06:26.270 --> 06:29.398
The city's most eligible bachelors
are here tonight

06:29.481 --> 06:31.483
and you're sitting in the corner.

06:31.567 --> 06:33.819
Humor me. Make an effort.

06:33.902 --> 06:37.573
I don't want everyone talking about how
my daughter looked miserable all night.

06:42.036 --> 06:45.122
<i>Mary Rathcart first upset
her parents' lofty expectations</i>

06:45.205 --> 06:47.625
<i>when, at the age of 12,</i>

06:47.708 --> 06:51.378
<i>she was expelled from the city's
most prestigious private school.</i>

06:52.755 --> 06:54.256
<i>By the time she was 16,</i>

06:54.381 --> 06:58.010
<i>she had been kicked out
of every private school in town.</i>

06:58.093 --> 07:00.971
<i>But she finally went too far</i>

07:01.055 --> 07:03.307
<i>when she fell for Benjamin Gibbon,</i>

07:03.390 --> 07:07.102
<i>the notorious son
of her father's bitter rival.</i>

07:07.186 --> 07:10.189
<i>When the news broke,
it was an instant scandal</i>

07:10.272 --> 07:14.860
<i>and she was strictly forbidden
from seeing the Gibbon boy ever again,</i>

07:14.943 --> 07:18.989
<i>which, as far as Mary was concerned,
simply wasn't an option.</i>

07:19.073 --> 07:23.410
<i>So she made a secret plan
to abscond with Ben to Mexico.</i>

07:23.494 --> 07:26.288
<i>But their plan was soon thwarted</i>

07:26.413 --> 07:30.125
<i>and Mary was abruptly shipped off
to boarding school in Paris,</i>

07:30.250 --> 07:35.381
<i>where her talents would be cultivated
in a more regimented environment.</i>

07:35.464 --> 07:37.758
<i>Mary wrote Ben many times,</i>

07:37.841 --> 07:40.427
<i>first to say...</i>

07:40.511 --> 07:43.013
- <i>I miss you.</i>
- <i>Then to ask...</i>

07:43.097 --> 07:45.766
<i>Did you forget me?</i>

07:45.849 --> 07:47.559
- <i>Then simply...</i>
- Fuck you!

07:47.643 --> 07:50.270
<i>But for reasons
Mary couldn't fathom,</i>

07:50.354 --> 07:52.439
<i>Ben never wrote back.</i>

07:52.523 --> 07:55.025
<i>And so she never wrote again.</i>

07:55.109 --> 08:00.030
<i>She did her best to forget about Ben
and forget the world she left behind.</i>

08:01.615 --> 08:04.201
<i>She remained in Paris
to study at the Sorbonne</i>

08:04.284 --> 08:07.204
<i>and committed herself
to a brand new life,</i>

08:07.287 --> 08:10.708
<i>but her heart remained fraught,</i>

08:10.791 --> 08:16.004
<i>plagued by a chronic loneliness
she simply couldn't shake.</i>

08:16.088 --> 08:18.173
<i>And yet her overbearing father</i>

08:18.257 --> 08:21.051
<i>made sure she was
always closely watched,</i>

08:21.135 --> 08:24.096
<i>so she was never
quite as alone as she felt.</i>

08:25.431 --> 08:30.060
<i>In the end, time doused
what fire was left in her</i>

08:30.144 --> 08:33.897
<i>and like a domesticated bird
seeking the comfort of the cage,</i>

08:33.981 --> 08:38.068
<i>she returned home, weary and humbled,</i>

08:38.152 --> 08:41.321
<i>right back where she started.</i>

08:41.405 --> 08:43.698
I said, "See him out."

08:43.782 --> 08:46.034
Benjamin was already leaving, William.

08:47.077 --> 08:49.955
What? Do you have something to say?

08:51.790 --> 08:53.292
Just wanted to show face.

08:53.375 --> 08:57.463
Why don't you throw a steak on that eye?
You look like a goddamn criminal.

08:58.839 --> 09:01.425
<i>For generations, the Gibbon
and Rathcart families</i>

09:01.508 --> 09:04.178
<i>had stood in staunch
opposition of one another.</i>

09:04.303 --> 09:07.514
<i>One might even go as far
as to call it a "blood feud,"</i>

09:07.598 --> 09:11.059
<i>and like all blood feuds,</i>

09:11.185 --> 09:13.020
<i>it began with a bit of blood.</i>

09:13.103 --> 09:15.606
<i>The year was 1864.</i>

09:15.689 --> 09:17.733
<i>Tarleton Rathcart
and Theodore Gibbon,</i>

09:17.816 --> 09:21.862
<i>both powerful figures in New York City's
burgeoning news industry,</i>

09:21.945 --> 09:25.073
<i>met as gentlemen duelers
after an unflattering story</i>

09:25.157 --> 09:29.369
<i>was run in Theodore's paper
in regards to Tarleton's shoes.</i>

09:29.495 --> 09:31.455
<i>Theodore fell to Tarleton's bullet,</i>

09:31.538 --> 09:33.540
<i>uttering the dying words...</i>

09:33.665 --> 09:38.712
Tell that cheating bastard Rathcart
I'll see him in hell.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.341
<i>Over the years,
both families' publications</i>

09:42.424 --> 09:45.552
<i>grew steadily into opposing media
conglomerates</i>

09:45.636 --> 09:49.139
<i>known today as
Gibbon Telecommunications</i>

09:49.223 --> 09:51.058
<i>and the Rathcart Corporation,</i>

09:51.141 --> 09:53.811
<i>and the dueling continued.</i>

09:53.894 --> 09:57.564
<i>One could easily call it the most
combative media rivalry in history,</i>

09:57.648 --> 10:00.359
<i>but for Henry Gibbon
and William Rathcart,</i>

10:00.442 --> 10:04.571
<i>it was never about business...
it was personal.</i>

10:09.868 --> 10:12.412
Excuse us. Come, son.

10:17.960 --> 10:20.170
You're a grown man.

10:20.254 --> 10:21.839
It's time you act like it.

10:24.091 --> 10:25.092
Get out.

10:29.513 --> 10:31.181
What was that all about?

10:31.265 --> 10:33.433
William was a little harsh, wasn't he?

10:33.517 --> 10:35.102
Mary's back.

10:46.363 --> 10:47.781
Bro, the coats.

10:52.953 --> 10:54.204
Hmm.

10:55.205 --> 10:57.916
Okay.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.460
Security!

11:00.544 --> 11:02.212
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, you got it?

11:02.296 --> 11:03.797
Go, go, go, go, go!

11:03.881 --> 11:06.592
He stole the coats again.

11:06.675 --> 11:09.303
Walter,
that's my coat! Stop him!

11:09.428 --> 11:11.889
Gibbon!

11:18.437 --> 11:22.316
<i>Mary's exile to Paris
was conducted swiftly and without warning.</i>

11:23.483 --> 11:27.738
<i>He called and texted,
but was never answered.</i>

11:27.821 --> 11:30.741
<i>He emailed,
but received no response.</i>

11:32.534 --> 11:37.247
<i>Mary's whereabouts and her silence
remained a haunting mystery</i>

11:37.331 --> 11:42.169
<i>until Ben happened across a gossip story
detailing her exploits in Paris.</i>

11:43.253 --> 11:48.258
<i>Heartbroken, Ben used the one-way ticket
he had hoped to use with Mary</i>

11:48.342 --> 11:51.637
<i>and disappeared
to Mexico unannounced,</i>

11:51.720 --> 11:53.805
<i>with no intention of returning.</i>

11:53.889 --> 11:58.185
<i>His only attempt to communicate
his dire existential intentions</i>

11:58.268 --> 12:01.396
<i>was a cryptic letter
sent to his mother and father.</i>

12:10.822 --> 12:15.202
<i>He returned seven months later
in the company of Mukul.</i>

12:15.285 --> 12:16.954
<i>Having sworn an oath of secrecy,</i>

12:17.037 --> 12:19.289
<i>neither of them ever
spoke a word of how they met,</i>

12:19.373 --> 12:23.293
<i>but they had been
inseparable ever since.</i>

13:24.438 --> 13:27.024
You know, I just can't stomach this.

13:27.107 --> 13:30.861
After all these years, you'd think even
that kid would find a way to grow up.

13:30.944 --> 13:32.779
Henry's gonna have
to write a check this time.

13:32.863 --> 13:34.781
It's best to not get embroiled, darling.

13:34.865 --> 13:36.450
He does this kind of thing often?

13:36.533 --> 13:39.202
Whenever he decides to show his face.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.496
Oh, I know that look, Mary.

13:41.580 --> 13:44.875
- Shall I pull out the scrapbook?
- No, please, don't.

13:45.959 --> 13:48.962
You know, most parents keep
a record of their kids' achievements,

13:49.046 --> 13:50.672
not their failures. It's weird.

13:50.756 --> 13:53.884
My mother always said, "There's no greater
teacher than shame."

13:55.135 --> 13:57.137
Don't be dramatic. It's funny.

13:57.220 --> 13:58.722
I wouldn't wish him on my worst enemy.

13:58.805 --> 14:02.726
Third grade report card.
Flabbergasting precociousness.

14:02.809 --> 14:04.686
The boy is
properly sick in the head.

14:04.811 --> 14:06.313
Turned down the family fortune.

14:06.396 --> 14:08.315
- He did?
- Oh, I love this one.

14:08.398 --> 14:09.900
You remember Felix Graham?

14:09.983 --> 14:12.027
He had a few sessions
with him some years back.

14:12.152 --> 14:13.862
Pathological contrariness.

14:13.945 --> 14:15.447
Said he had a screw loose.

14:15.530 --> 14:17.449
- Oh, this is classic.
- Point taken.

14:17.532 --> 14:20.827
He said he had some kind
of death wish taking all those beatings.

14:20.911 --> 14:23.622
Imagine a kid
getting a diagnosis like that.

14:23.705 --> 14:25.373
- A death wish?
- Enough!

14:25.457 --> 14:27.250
Ben Gibbon is in the past,

14:27.334 --> 14:29.377
just like all of these
other regrettable decisions.

14:29.461 --> 14:32.756
And you being home doesn't change
anything. Am I understood?

14:32.839 --> 14:34.674
<i>Mary knew that a prerequisite</i>

14:34.800 --> 14:37.094
<i>for being back home
under her parents' roof</i>

14:37.177 --> 14:40.180
<i>was maintaining
a quietly obedient exterior.</i>

14:41.890 --> 14:44.851
Fuck!

14:48.522 --> 14:49.481
Mary.

14:50.482 --> 14:52.234
Something to say?

14:54.569 --> 14:55.570
No.

15:12.337 --> 15:13.463
<i>The young male gibbon</i>

15:13.547 --> 15:16.633
<i>will now challenge the dominant male
for control of the family.</i>

15:17.717 --> 15:19.886
<i>If the adolescent continues his challenge,</i>

15:19.970 --> 15:22.722
<i>the dominant male will respond
with a violent attack...</i>

15:25.142 --> 15:28.145
<i>forcing the young gibbon to strike off
on its own in search of a mate.</i>

15:46.454 --> 15:47.289
Hmm.

16:13.023 --> 16:14.941
- Hey, strangers!
- Cheers.

16:16.568 --> 16:18.153
- Oh, my God!
- Lily.

16:18.278 --> 16:19.905
- Finally.
- You're back, wow!

16:19.988 --> 16:22.324
- Oh my God, shots!
- She's here.

16:22.449 --> 16:23.992
- Cheers.
- Oh.

16:24.117 --> 16:26.203
- We'll keep 'em going.
- What's going on?

16:26.286 --> 16:27.787
I have to dance.

16:29.623 --> 16:31.374
What are we forgetting?

16:31.458 --> 16:34.836
Oh, God. Everything.

17:03.531 --> 17:04.866
Oh!

17:07.661 --> 17:09.412
- Terrence.
- Peekaboo.

17:10.997 --> 17:12.499
What are you doing here?

17:13.791 --> 17:15.669
I missed you.

17:15.752 --> 17:18.755
- How did you know I was here?
- Come with me.

17:18.838 --> 17:22.175
I got us a private room, so we can talk
away from these animals.

17:22.259 --> 17:23.843
Terrence.

17:36.189 --> 17:38.149
You followed me here, didn't you?

17:38.233 --> 17:39.943
It would appear that way.

17:40.026 --> 17:43.697
Well, that's not your job anymore,
SO you need to stop doing it.

17:53.373 --> 17:54.833
Mary.

17:58.753 --> 18:01.840
I recall the good times
we shared together.

18:01.923 --> 18:04.134
The romantic nights.

18:08.305 --> 18:10.890
Look at this little lost soul, doll.

18:17.355 --> 18:18.982
I think he's cute.

18:19.065 --> 18:20.317
Oh.

18:21.318 --> 18:23.069
My wife thinks you're cute.

18:24.070 --> 18:25.363
Like a rabbit.

18:31.536 --> 18:34.831
Why don't you go over there and play
with the new pet rabbit, huh?

18:34.914 --> 18:36.416
Go on, have fun.

18:45.967 --> 18:50.805
Hey, Rabbit, you know what I've always
thought would be a cool way to die?

18:51.806 --> 18:53.475
Shark attack.

18:53.558 --> 18:55.143
A big fish

18:55.226 --> 18:59.522
with big, bloody
razor-sharp teeth eating you.

19:01.941 --> 19:03.610
There he is.

19:05.153 --> 19:06.613
Oh, here he comes.

19:12.494 --> 19:16.623
Yeah, see, the point is, mate,
we're all running round, right?

19:16.706 --> 19:18.917
Like we're too special to get eaten
by a bloody shark.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.460
But we're not, right?

19:20.543 --> 19:23.338
We're just monkeys. Monkeys in suits.

19:23.421 --> 19:25.382
We are just little bloody mascots

19:25.465 --> 19:28.593
for the great,
big organ grinder in the sky.

19:33.890 --> 19:37.644
So, Rabbit, how do you wanna die?

19:45.985 --> 19:48.113
I wanna die in a gunfight.

19:50.240 --> 19:53.451
Die in a gunfight? You hear that, doll?

19:53.535 --> 19:56.996
Here we was, just thinking
you were a scared little baby rabbit.

19:58.748 --> 19:59.791
Jesus, mate.

20:00.792 --> 20:02.877
Look what you've gone and done.

20:02.961 --> 20:04.504
It's true what they say, I guess.

20:04.629 --> 20:06.506
Every bird likes a bad boy.

20:07.507 --> 20:09.008
How old are you,
you rascally little wabbit?

20:09.134 --> 20:10.093
I'm 27.

20:10.176 --> 20:12.220
Bullshit, mate. I don't believe you.

20:12.345 --> 20:15.932
- I wanna see some identification, please.
- Guys.

20:16.015 --> 20:18.268
Where are you bloody going, mate?
Sit, sit, sit, sit.

20:18.351 --> 20:22.063
Come on, hand it over.
Come on. You're not under arrest yet.

20:25.233 --> 20:26.985
Checks out. Have a look at that, doll.

20:27.068 --> 20:29.070
It's a lot of fun,
but I have to get going.

20:29.154 --> 20:31.322
- Oh, no.
- Rabbit!

20:32.532 --> 20:34.409
We're just getting started here, mate.

20:34.492 --> 20:38.288
After everything
that we've been through together,

20:38.371 --> 20:40.707
I wouldn't have thought
that you'd be ashamed of me.

20:40.832 --> 20:42.542
I have nothing to be ashamed of.

20:43.543 --> 20:45.336
Good.

20:45.420 --> 20:49.048
Because I think the feelings...

20:50.049 --> 20:53.511
our feelings, are still there.

20:53.595 --> 20:55.221
There were never any feelings.

20:56.222 --> 20:57.223
Mm.

20:58.224 --> 20:59.559
Terrence.

21:00.852 --> 21:01.853
I...

21:05.315 --> 21:06.691
That was then.

21:06.774 --> 21:08.401
This is fucking now.

21:08.485 --> 21:10.904
- What are you doing?
- Mary, I love you.

21:11.029 --> 21:13.656
- Terrence, please. I don't love you.
- Mary...

21:13.740 --> 21:15.992
Okay, just... Terrence.

21:16.993 --> 21:19.996
- What is that?
- Our logical conclusion.

21:20.079 --> 21:22.957
Are you insane?

21:23.082 --> 21:24.918
Terrence, just go.

21:31.007 --> 21:32.217
Terrence, just go.

21:32.300 --> 21:34.761
Mary, come on.

21:36.346 --> 21:38.473
Terrence, please, just go away.

21:39.724 --> 21:41.935
Hey, Barb, you wanna dance with Rabbit?

21:42.018 --> 21:44.187
She's a really good dancer.

21:44.270 --> 21:46.606
No. Like I said,
I have to get going.

21:48.775 --> 21:50.443
I said dance.

21:51.444 --> 21:52.946
What's up, doc?

21:54.364 --> 21:56.241
Whoo!

21:56.324 --> 21:58.284
She is my shining angel.

21:59.619 --> 22:01.871
And if my shining angel wants to dance,

22:01.955 --> 22:04.207
then she's gonna
bloody well dance, mate.

22:04.290 --> 22:05.458
Isn't that right, hon?

22:05.542 --> 22:07.961
Sure is, sugar pie.

22:08.044 --> 22:09.712
Look at this, mate.

22:11.881 --> 22:14.801
Two halves make a whole.

22:15.802 --> 22:17.220
- I love you, baby.
- I love you.

22:21.057 --> 22:24.477
You wouldn't wanna hurt my angel's
feelings now, would you, Wabbit?

22:24.561 --> 22:26.688
No, but like I said, I have to get going.

22:26.813 --> 22:30.483
Here I am,
thinking that you're a big grown rabbit.

22:31.484 --> 22:32.569
Maybe I'm wrong.

22:33.653 --> 22:35.572
Maybe you're just a pussy.

22:35.655 --> 22:38.116
Oh, come on now, grizzly, be nice.

22:38.199 --> 22:41.160
Oh, well, I didn't wear these dancing
shoes for nothing, hon.

22:44.664 --> 22:47.333
So what's it gonna be mate, hmm?

22:47.417 --> 22:49.502
You a rabbit?

22:50.503 --> 22:52.463
Or a pussy?

22:53.464 --> 22:55.341
All right, enough.

22:55.425 --> 22:56.342
Oh.

22:56.426 --> 22:59.470
You're either gonna let me out,
or I'm gonna make you let me.

22:59.554 --> 23:02.181
Look at this, doll, huh?

23:02.265 --> 23:06.352
Looks like me and Rabbit
are gonna dance.

23:06.436 --> 23:08.229
What, we gonna do the waltz?

23:08.313 --> 23:10.898
We're gonna have a little bloody melee.

23:13.443 --> 23:14.902
Give it everything you got, mate.

24:45.368 --> 24:46.202
Hi.

24:50.164 --> 24:50.998
Hi.

24:55.378 --> 24:56.879
So this is your place?

24:57.880 --> 24:59.841
I own it, yeah.

25:02.468 --> 25:04.303
You bought this apartment?

25:04.387 --> 25:05.888
Yeah, I did.

25:07.473 --> 25:09.267
And the entire building around it.

25:10.935 --> 25:12.520
How?

25:12.645 --> 25:15.481
Word on the street
is you're poor on purpose.

25:15.565 --> 25:17.233
It's kind of a long story.

25:18.234 --> 25:19.819
Okay.

25:32.749 --> 25:34.375
Care to elaborate?

25:35.877 --> 25:37.837
Mukul and I took an oath of secrecy.

25:44.427 --> 25:45.845
Why didn't you write?

25:51.058 --> 25:52.518
Why did you leave?

25:54.896 --> 25:56.939
You should wash this blood off.

26:06.532 --> 26:08.034
<i>Pamela Corbett-Ragsdale,</i>

26:08.117 --> 26:11.287
<i>a former research and development
executive for Rathcart Computers</i>

26:11.370 --> 26:15.458
<i>will be sitting down with our own
Alan Gregory tomorrow night</i>

26:15.541 --> 26:18.127
<i>in an exclusive live interview.</i>

26:18.211 --> 26:20.046
<i>Corbett-Ragsdale will be discussing</i>

26:20.171 --> 26:24.634
<i>the alleged internal memos
circulated within Rathcart Corporation</i>

26:24.717 --> 26:27.887
<i>requiring employees
of Rathcart Computers</i>

26:27.970 --> 26:30.556
<i>to sign a non-disclosure agreement</i>

26:30.640 --> 26:32.892
<i>concerning a secretive program</i>

26:32.975 --> 26:34.727
<i>called "Info Net."</i>

26:34.811 --> 26:39.190
<i>Up next, murder mystery.
That story, coming up next.</i>

26:39.273 --> 26:42.026
<i>When a desperate
William Rathcart came to Terrence Uberahl</i>

26:42.109 --> 26:46.072
<i>asking him to handle his potentially
devastating whistleblower problem,</i>

26:46.155 --> 26:49.659
<i>Terrence was elated,
certain that a job well done</i>

26:49.742 --> 26:53.246
<i>was his ticket to securing
Mary's hand in marriage.</i>

26:53.371 --> 26:57.208
<i>So he made arrangements with the best
contract killer in the business.</i>

26:57.291 --> 26:59.085
What's the status
on Corbett-Ragsdale?

26:59.168 --> 27:01.254
She checked into the Plaza
this morning, sir.

27:01.337 --> 27:03.339
- And?
- And you have nothing to worry about.

27:04.507 --> 27:07.927
I'm loyal to you, William,
and to the corporation.

27:08.010 --> 27:12.306
I feel very much like part of the family.

27:12.390 --> 27:15.852
Well, your father and I
were like brothers. You're like a son.

27:15.935 --> 27:18.271
My sentiments exactly.

27:18.396 --> 27:22.567
What if I could be...
more than like a son?

27:24.735 --> 27:26.821
Mary and I became very close

27:26.946 --> 27:30.283
while I was keeping an eye on her
for you in Paris.

27:30.366 --> 27:34.537
I recall you blew your cover,
put yourself at her mercy.

27:35.955 --> 27:38.291
I took my job of protecting her
very seriously

27:38.374 --> 27:39.959
and I'd like to continue protecting her.

27:40.042 --> 27:42.753
Yeah? In what capacity?

27:42.837 --> 27:44.380
As her husband.

27:49.093 --> 27:51.304
I proposed last night, sir.

27:53.472 --> 27:55.474
If you approve, of course.

27:59.478 --> 28:00.897
I'll make you a deal.

28:00.980 --> 28:04.650
You take care of my problem,
I'll grant you my daughter's hand.

28:06.485 --> 28:08.154
Just one thing.

28:08.237 --> 28:10.364
Not with Ragsdale, sir, with Mary.

28:11.449 --> 28:13.492
I put a few of my men on her
just to be safe

28:13.576 --> 28:15.828
and they informed me that
she spent the night last night

28:15.912 --> 28:18.748
with... Benjamin Gibbon.

28:19.999 --> 28:21.959
- I thought you said you proposed to her.
- I did.

28:22.043 --> 28:24.837
She just hasn't said "yes" yet,
hence the problem.

28:24.962 --> 28:26.505
How would you like me to proceed?

28:26.631 --> 28:30.343
How about you stop being a pussy
and just put the fear of God in him?

28:31.344 --> 28:32.470
Yes, sir.

28:43.856 --> 28:46.692
<i>Mary said goodbye. Seems nice.</i>

28:55.785 --> 28:57.328
Don't look at me like that.

29:02.208 --> 29:04.377
Time to go.

29:05.878 --> 29:09.382
You don't want to be late
for your mom's brunch, hmm?

29:21.769 --> 29:22.603
Ahem.

29:52.633 --> 29:54.385
Mary Rathcart?

29:56.929 --> 29:58.931
Ben Gibbon.

30:01.684 --> 30:05.062
Do I need to explain to you
why this is unacceptable?

30:06.564 --> 30:07.940
Who told you that?

30:09.608 --> 30:11.610
We've always had
such high hopes for you.

30:13.571 --> 30:15.614
But you continually disappoint us.

30:15.698 --> 30:18.576
- I'm sorry, I don't mean to continue...
- To what, Mary?

30:18.659 --> 30:21.954
Help the boy's father drag my fucking name
through the mud?

30:24.957 --> 30:26.792
I'm not sure he needs my help.

30:27.793 --> 30:29.211
My God, you need a leash.

30:29.295 --> 30:30.755
- William.
- Ah!

30:30.838 --> 30:32.590
The Rathcarts have been running
their empire

30:32.673 --> 30:36.552
like a criminal organization
for generations,

30:36.635 --> 30:40.389
but this Rathcart scandal
is a unique opportunity.

30:40.473 --> 30:43.893
It's my chance to end it.

30:45.811 --> 30:48.147
But how can do I that

30:48.230 --> 30:51.650
when my son is photographed
cavorting with the man's daughter?

30:52.651 --> 30:54.570
That drags us into it.

30:54.653 --> 30:57.615
It clouds the issue,
just when I need things to be...

31:05.414 --> 31:07.792
Sorry, Dad. I'm listening.

31:08.834 --> 31:11.420
...crystal clear.

31:11.504 --> 31:15.424
Thank God Terrence is so willing
to take you off our hands.

31:15.508 --> 31:17.093
- He is?
- Of course he is.

31:17.176 --> 31:19.011
He's a rabid dog Dad won't call off.

31:19.136 --> 31:23.349
But I thought the two of you
were... friends in Paris.

31:24.892 --> 31:27.520
As much as you can be friends
with a fucking stalker.

31:29.647 --> 31:32.733
Keep your friends close
and your enemies closer, right, Dad?

31:42.326 --> 31:44.161
I love the choice of music, Mrs. Gibbon.

31:45.162 --> 31:46.789
Thank you, Mukul.

31:46.872 --> 31:49.625
Do you guys know
what Beethoven's last words were?

31:49.708 --> 31:52.962
<i>"Plaudite, amici, comedia finita est."</i>

31:53.045 --> 31:54.255
"Friends, applaud.

31:54.380 --> 31:56.632
The comedy is finished."

31:56.715 --> 31:59.260
Goddamn it! I've had enough!

32:00.386 --> 32:02.471
All you had to do was play ball

32:02.555 --> 32:04.515
and all of this would have been yours.

32:04.598 --> 32:07.601
I appreciate the offer, Dad,
but I'd rather play with my own balls.

32:08.936 --> 32:13.440
And what will you do when whatever it is
you're living on runs out, hmm?

32:13.524 --> 32:15.484
Please, enlighten us.

32:15.568 --> 32:19.405
You know, I've been really putting
a lot of thought into it.

32:20.406 --> 32:21.407
Glad you ask.

32:29.415 --> 32:30.416
Fishing.

32:31.417 --> 32:33.252
I think I'll be a fisherman.

32:33.335 --> 32:36.297
And Mukul here will
be my first mate, right?

32:37.882 --> 32:40.050
He takes after you. You know that?

32:41.177 --> 32:45.222
This family needs to present
a unified front and we need a distraction.

32:46.307 --> 32:48.017
So I should marry a man I don't love?

32:48.100 --> 32:49.268
Oh, Jesus Christ.

32:49.351 --> 32:53.856
Your entire life, you have lived
off the spoils of your bloodline.

32:53.939 --> 32:56.108
Yes, now comes the reckoning!

32:56.192 --> 32:59.778
So for once you will do as I say!

33:02.364 --> 33:05.367
I worked my entire life
to build my reputation

33:05.451 --> 33:11.624
and I am entirely unwilling to let you
and your Rasputin ruin it.

33:11.707 --> 33:13.918
No, no, no, no, no. Mukul is my
very good friend and our guest.

33:14.001 --> 33:15.085
Leave him out of this.

33:15.169 --> 33:18.088
Don't you think we're taking this
a bit far, boys?

33:18.172 --> 33:22.551
You fight, you steal,
you drink, you're a disgrace.

33:27.306 --> 33:28.432
Do you hear me?

33:29.725 --> 33:31.310
Henry.

33:32.311 --> 33:33.312
Do you hear me?

33:34.647 --> 33:35.940
I hear you.

33:36.023 --> 33:38.609
Your name may be Gibbon...

33:38.692 --> 33:42.238
- And?
- And it's bullshit.

33:42.321 --> 33:44.698
...but you're not fit for this family.

33:44.782 --> 33:46.116
And I'm not putting up with it.

33:47.660 --> 33:50.955
- Hey!
- You wanna act like a goddamn animal?

33:51.038 --> 33:52.248
There is your cage!

34:02.758 --> 34:04.260
Okay.

34:19.608 --> 34:20.609
Benjamin.

34:29.201 --> 34:30.577
You're excused.

34:33.998 --> 34:35.791
Sorry, Mom.

34:38.377 --> 34:41.839
I am. I'm sorry.

34:43.549 --> 34:44.717
Go.

34:46.467 --> 34:47.761
Just go, Ben.

34:59.398 --> 35:01.734
I apologize if I played any part

35:01.817 --> 35:06.238
in ruining your lovely Mother's Day
celebration, Mrs. Gibbon.

35:14.747 --> 35:15.581
Hmm.

35:18.417 --> 35:19.335
Mm-hmm.

35:22.963 --> 35:26.717
<i>Later that night,
alone in their respective rooms,</i>

35:26.800 --> 35:31.055
<i>Mary and Ben found themselves doing
what many of us tend to do</i>

35:31.138 --> 35:32.473
<i>when we're feeling forlorn.</i>

35:33.474 --> 35:36.310
<i>They were contemplating
the events of the past...</i>

35:36.393 --> 35:40.689
<i>the precious highs,
the devastating lows,</i>

35:40.773 --> 35:45.194
<i>and the choices they had made
or failed to make in between,</i>

35:45.277 --> 35:48.947
<i>all of which, when added up,
had led them right here...</i>

35:50.115 --> 35:52.826
<i>to this very moment.</i>

35:52.951 --> 35:57.206
<i>They felt haunted by a suspicion</i>

35:57.289 --> 36:01.919
<i>that history was somehow repeating itself.</i>

36:10.928 --> 36:13.555
<i>And so each in their own way,</i>

36:13.639 --> 36:16.475
<i>they resolved to throw caution to the wind</i>

36:16.600 --> 36:20.479
<i>and do something quite different
this time around.</i>

36:35.035 --> 36:36.912
Shh, shh! Hey, hey, hey.

36:36.995 --> 36:40.165
- Shh, shh!
- What are you doing here?

36:45.587 --> 36:47.840
Why are you always leaving, huh?

36:49.425 --> 36:50.634
What?

36:53.137 --> 36:55.848
I don't know.
I... I can't be here anymore.

36:59.852 --> 37:03.730
Mary, we're at the age where it's
pretty much time to conform or die.

37:03.814 --> 37:06.066
We grew up thinking
we're gonna be something special

37:06.150 --> 37:08.610
and do something heroic
with our lives, you know,

37:08.694 --> 37:12.114
and they let us live in that fantasy
for 20-something years.

37:12.197 --> 37:13.991
And then what?

37:14.074 --> 37:17.453
We're just supposed to surrender
and grow up, live with the heartbreak

37:17.536 --> 37:20.664
that our lives were never meant to be
as great as we thought they'd be.

37:24.042 --> 37:26.170
Honestly, I'd rather die.

37:31.133 --> 37:32.551
What if there's another way?

37:35.596 --> 37:38.599
What if greatness for me...

37:42.686 --> 37:43.896
is loving you?

37:45.898 --> 37:48.692
Loving you perfectly, and fuck the rest.

37:53.530 --> 37:55.032
I can live with that, you know.

37:56.992 --> 37:59.495
I'm pretty sure
that kind of love never dies.

38:13.842 --> 38:15.511
Mary.

38:17.846 --> 38:18.847
Fuck it.

38:19.848 --> 38:20.849
Fuck it.

38:25.562 --> 38:27.022
You wanna get out of here?

38:27.105 --> 38:28.524
Mary!

38:29.608 --> 38:31.109
We need to talk.

38:49.878 --> 38:54.258
I have an idea, in the interest of this
not being weird.

38:54.341 --> 38:57.344
Let's just start over. You know,
pretend we're complete strangers

38:57.427 --> 38:59.721
and it's the first time we've ever met.

39:00.722 --> 39:03.475
- Like a blind date?
- Yeah, exactly.

39:04.476 --> 39:05.727
Okay, then.

39:05.811 --> 39:07.813
So hi, I'm Mary.

39:08.981 --> 39:10.816
Oh, you're really excited to meet me.

39:11.858 --> 39:14.570
Hi. Hi. Hi, I'm Mary.

39:14.653 --> 39:17.531
Yeah, okay, great.
Mary, hi, I'm Ben.

39:17.614 --> 39:19.032
- Hi.
- Pleasure to meet you.

39:19.116 --> 39:20.867
Pleasure's all mine.

39:26.290 --> 39:27.499
Now what?

39:30.252 --> 39:32.921
- Do you know who Ken Kesey is?
- Of course.

39:33.005 --> 39:36.341
You know, he had this thing where he
always talked about making this movie,

39:36.466 --> 39:39.344
like he was living his life
making this movie.

39:39.428 --> 39:44.016
I always liked that.
I always thought of my life that way.

39:45.017 --> 39:46.852
So am I in your movie now?

39:47.853 --> 39:49.646
You've always been in my movie.

39:50.647 --> 39:52.691
You better watch out.

39:52.774 --> 39:56.111
I studied acting, so I'm gonna be
the star of your movie.

39:56.194 --> 39:59.531
- Hmm.
- But I'm really, really bad at crying.

39:59.615 --> 40:01.617
There was, like, a whole class on how
to cry on command

40:01.700 --> 40:04.036
and I could never do it. Never.

40:07.539 --> 40:09.958
All right. Well, we're gonna need
some backstory.

40:10.042 --> 40:13.545
- Um, may I ask you a personal question?
- Sure.

40:14.546 --> 40:16.214
Who was the guy you
were with last night?

40:17.549 --> 40:20.969
I wasn't with a guy.
He works for my dad.

40:21.053 --> 40:23.722
When I was in Paris,

40:23.805 --> 40:27.768
my dad sent him to keep an eye on me
and I wasn't supposed to know.

40:27.851 --> 40:30.145
And then one morning,
I was having breakfast in a café

40:30.228 --> 40:32.731
and he just sat down
across from me and said...

40:32.814 --> 40:34.941
Good morning, Mary.

40:35.025 --> 40:37.527
I've weighed out my options
before sitting down with you.

40:37.611 --> 40:39.321
They were three in number.

40:39.404 --> 40:41.907
One, maintain the status quo
and keep my distance.

40:42.032 --> 40:44.910
Two, pretend to be a stranger
and take it from there.

40:44.993 --> 40:49.414
Three, just come right out
and hope for the best.

40:49.498 --> 40:53.126
And that being said,
I simply can no longer keep my distance.

40:53.251 --> 40:55.379
And honesty is usually the best policy,

40:55.462 --> 40:57.547
so I've decided to go with option three.

40:59.800 --> 41:02.135
That's fascinating.

41:02.219 --> 41:05.013
Mostly, though, I'm wondering who you are,
what you want from me,

41:05.097 --> 41:08.809
and why I shouldn't take this knife
and put it in your fucking eye?

41:10.352 --> 41:12.187
My name is Terrence Uberahl.

41:13.188 --> 41:14.898
And I work for your father,

41:15.941 --> 41:18.443
Mr. William Rathcart.

41:18.568 --> 41:21.363
He has stationed me here
as an invisible agent, so to speak.

41:21.446 --> 41:26.284
I've been charged more precisely
with keeping an eye on you

41:26.368 --> 41:29.830
and stepping in if you were
to invite undue trouble.

41:30.831 --> 41:32.499
Why doesn't that surprise me?

41:34.084 --> 41:37.003
You know, wouldn't it be so much more...

41:38.630 --> 41:42.676
profitable if I were to come clean
and reveal myself to you?

41:42.759 --> 41:44.302
I mean, after all,
lurking in the background

41:44.386 --> 41:47.055
pales in comparison to being included.

41:47.139 --> 41:48.473
Included?

41:48.598 --> 41:51.476
Well, what I mean is,

41:51.560 --> 41:55.313
you know, I could complete my mission

41:55.439 --> 42:00.485
and report all the details of your comings
and goings to your father or...

42:03.280 --> 42:07.534
you and I could become in cahoots.

42:07.617 --> 42:10.203
And all he'd have to hear is
a bare and unexciting minimum.

42:12.205 --> 42:16.877
And you know, all I'd ask in return
is for you to grace me with your company,

42:16.960 --> 42:19.379
only when you have time, of course.

42:24.134 --> 42:26.511
So you're a double agent, are you?

42:26.595 --> 42:29.598
<i>Mademoiselle,</i> I am merely an agent.

42:29.681 --> 42:32.017
Of what, I have no idea.

42:37.606 --> 42:40.025
I haven't been able to shake him since.

42:41.151 --> 42:43.945
It was kind of like
giving scraps to a stray.

42:45.363 --> 42:47.949
He proposed to me last night with a ring.

42:48.033 --> 42:49.785
Like, he actually went out
and he bought a ring,

42:49.868 --> 42:51.828
which means he thought
that I actually might say yes,

42:51.912 --> 42:55.040
which means he's not
just a little off-kilter like I thought.

42:55.123 --> 42:59.211
He's actually... He's insane.
And my dad wants me to say yes.

42:59.336 --> 43:01.880
But I always knew
that he was fucking nuts.

43:04.132 --> 43:06.218
So, here I am.

43:09.137 --> 43:10.138
Hey, you're bleeding.

43:11.473 --> 43:12.599
- Oh.
- Here.

43:13.975 --> 43:16.478
- Oh. No, no, no, it's fine.
- Let me see.

43:38.083 --> 43:40.585
Turn it off. Turn it off!

43:41.586 --> 43:43.839
Just... Man, turn it off!

43:43.922 --> 43:46.049
Just go. Go, go.

43:46.132 --> 43:48.176
We're gonna piss a lot of people off.

43:49.177 --> 43:50.637
To hell with them.

44:15.620 --> 44:18.915
<i>Meanwhile, Terrence Uberahl's
hitman, Wayne McCarty,</i>

44:18.999 --> 44:21.042
<i>who had instructed Terrence
to leave his payment</i>

44:21.126 --> 44:24.462
<i>in a bathroom stall at Club Wildlife
the night before,</i>

44:24.546 --> 44:26.798
<i>was making a detour with his wife Barbie</i>

44:26.882 --> 44:29.467
<i>en route to killing
Pamela Corbett-Ragsdale.</i>

44:32.095 --> 44:34.890
Hey. You got this, baby.

44:34.973 --> 44:36.933
I'll be right here, cheering you on.

44:37.976 --> 44:39.311
I'm so ashamed.

44:41.313 --> 44:43.315
I feel like a bloody criminal.

44:43.398 --> 44:45.025
You're no criminal.

44:46.484 --> 44:49.654
You're just a guy with a big heart

44:49.738 --> 44:51.990
and an even bigger personality.

44:53.533 --> 44:58.288
Remember, serenity is not
the absence of conflict...

44:59.456 --> 45:02.042
But the ability to cope with it.

45:02.125 --> 45:03.585
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

45:04.961 --> 45:06.212
We slipped.

45:07.756 --> 45:09.925
This is part of making it right.
You know it.

45:11.343 --> 45:12.677
Yeah, I know it.

45:12.802 --> 45:16.222
Mm-hmm,
so you just go on in there

45:16.348 --> 45:20.018
and give that boy back his wallet
and tell him you're sorry.

45:23.021 --> 45:25.815
You're a strong man, Wayne McCarty.

45:26.816 --> 45:29.569
Yeah.
That's why I love you.

45:31.071 --> 45:32.822
Now, go be strong.

45:35.116 --> 45:36.868
I don't deserve you, baby.

45:38.370 --> 45:40.038
I don't deserve you.

45:43.041 --> 45:44.209
Okay.

45:53.802 --> 45:55.553
Oh!

46:06.773 --> 46:09.859
<i>Mate, hey, you know, you shouldn't
leave your door open like that.</i>

46:09.943 --> 46:12.070
Geez, any weirdo
could just walk in on you.

46:14.364 --> 46:16.408
Oh, hey, guys.

46:16.533 --> 46:19.494
I'm looking for, uh, Rabbit.

46:19.577 --> 46:21.705
Who the fuck are you, man?

46:21.788 --> 46:24.082
I'm the guy looking for Rabbit.
Who the fuck are you?

46:24.165 --> 46:26.209
We're looking for Ben Gibbon.

46:26.292 --> 46:28.503
Ben is Rabbit. See? We're looking
for the same person, okay?

46:28.586 --> 46:31.965
So relax, I'm friends with him.
You guys friends with him?

46:32.048 --> 46:34.009
Didn't think so.
Look, let's start again.

46:34.092 --> 46:35.093
My name's...

46:37.303 --> 46:38.138
Oh...

46:40.557 --> 46:42.267
Good hit, buddy.

46:42.350 --> 46:44.102
Good hit. Stop, stop, stop, stop.

46:48.398 --> 46:49.774
Oh.

46:49.858 --> 46:51.276
S...

46:53.570 --> 46:55.613
Stop. Time out. Time out. Stop.

46:58.283 --> 47:00.452
<i>We're all looking for Ben.
You hear that?</i>

47:00.535 --> 47:03.121
Oh, look, he's pulling up
right now, guys. Look at...

47:21.139 --> 47:23.641
Fucking start the car!

47:23.767 --> 47:24.768
Oh, shit.

47:27.812 --> 47:28.772
Hey!

47:28.855 --> 47:29.856
Bye, guys!

47:31.566 --> 47:33.485
- Hey!
- Come on!

47:36.154 --> 47:38.364
Benji, you here?

47:46.956 --> 47:48.041
Oh.

47:56.633 --> 47:58.009
- Hey. Mukul.
- Hey.

47:58.093 --> 47:59.677
Uh, you... you've met Mary.

47:59.761 --> 48:01.805
- Hi. Hi, again.
- Hello, there.

48:01.888 --> 48:03.848
Um, I'm gonna go dry off.

48:03.932 --> 48:04.849
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

48:05.850 --> 48:07.018
She's sweet.

48:08.561 --> 48:10.105
- <i>You good?</i>
- Yeah.

48:10.188 --> 48:11.815
- So all bong gone?
- Yeah.

48:11.898 --> 48:13.691
What?

48:13.775 --> 48:17.403
So nothing weird or unusual to report?

48:18.404 --> 48:20.240
- No.
- No one weird?

48:21.324 --> 48:22.826
- No.
- Okay.

48:24.202 --> 48:25.537
- Why?
- Just...

48:26.704 --> 48:29.040
- You good?
- Yeah.

48:29.165 --> 48:31.376
Just keep your guard up. Hmm?

48:32.836 --> 48:35.296
You worry too much, brother. I love you.

48:35.380 --> 48:36.881
- Love you.
- Today is a great day!

48:36.965 --> 48:38.216
Just...

48:38.299 --> 48:39.384
Oh...

48:49.477 --> 48:51.855
Nice coat. Where'd you get it?

48:51.938 --> 48:54.065
A gift from me to you. Take it.

48:55.066 --> 48:56.985
You're too kind, really.

49:00.989 --> 49:02.407
All these people are dead.

49:09.914 --> 49:11.166
Turn around.

49:14.085 --> 49:15.128
Turn around.

49:30.310 --> 49:31.394
Okay.

49:35.899 --> 49:38.193
Stop looking at me like that.
You're making me shy.

49:59.589 --> 50:02.300
Oh, cool.

50:13.311 --> 50:14.479
Hmm.

50:16.606 --> 50:19.901
I still think about going away
to one of these places.

50:21.236 --> 50:25.740
Just starting a totally new life
where no one knows me.

50:26.741 --> 50:28.243
Totally anonymous.

50:29.244 --> 50:30.995
Well, that sounds nice, doesn't it?

50:33.539 --> 50:36.459
No, it's stupid, childish.

50:36.542 --> 50:39.420
- Childish, maybe. Not stupid.
- Yeah.

50:39.504 --> 50:42.757
Well, I tried it. It didn't exactly
pan out, so...

50:42.840 --> 50:46.010
Mm. No, you didn't.

50:46.135 --> 50:47.345
You bailed on it.

51:02.360 --> 51:04.737
You... You kept yours?

51:04.821 --> 51:07.240
- You didn't?
- I used mine.

51:07.323 --> 51:09.617
You left, so I went on my own.

51:11.119 --> 51:13.413
I didn't leave. I was sent.

51:16.040 --> 51:17.208
Oh.

51:19.377 --> 51:21.713
It's a pretty crazy idea
for a couple of kids.

51:22.755 --> 51:23.965
Yeah.

51:30.638 --> 51:32.974
- Do you have a death wish?
- What?

51:34.392 --> 51:36.102
Why would you ask that?

51:36.185 --> 51:38.354
I don't know. I'm just curious.

51:39.355 --> 51:40.356
Curious about what?

51:41.357 --> 51:43.735
Do you wanna die?

51:43.818 --> 51:46.738
- Didn't realize I had a choice.
- I'm being serious.

51:47.822 --> 51:49.324
When you think about dying,

51:49.407 --> 51:51.409
is it something that excites you?

51:54.203 --> 51:55.413
I don't know.

52:06.257 --> 52:07.383
Who's this?

52:08.718 --> 52:11.346
- That's my mom.
- My God.

52:13.514 --> 52:15.641
- She was a badass.
- Yeah.

52:15.725 --> 52:17.435
Married my dad young.

52:37.955 --> 52:39.082
May I?

52:41.667 --> 52:42.919
Be my guest.

52:47.256 --> 52:48.424
Thanks.

53:18.579 --> 53:20.415
Why would a guy like you wanna die?

53:21.791 --> 53:24.335
- I never said I did.
- You didn't say you didn't.

53:29.966 --> 53:32.176
What does it feel like
to get punched in the face?

53:33.177 --> 53:36.347
Um, I don't know. It hurts.

53:37.348 --> 53:38.724
Yeah?

53:38.850 --> 53:40.351
You like that or something?

53:44.647 --> 53:46.107
Punch me in the face.

53:47.775 --> 53:50.069
- What? No.
- I wanna know what it feels like.

53:50.153 --> 53:52.405
- I'm not gonna punch you in the face.
- I give you full permission.

53:52.488 --> 53:54.949
Just punch me,
like, right in the kisser. Do it.

53:55.032 --> 53:56.659
- What?
- Come on! A girl never gets a chance.

53:56.742 --> 53:58.119
- No, no.
- Do it!

53:58.202 --> 53:59.871
- Uh, I'm... I'm not...
- Just do it!

53:59.954 --> 54:01.372
Do it or I'll punch you in the face.

54:01.456 --> 54:03.124
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, do it.

54:03.207 --> 54:04.959
On the count of three, all right?

54:05.042 --> 54:07.170
One, two...

54:08.171 --> 54:09.172
I will do it.

54:10.173 --> 54:11.716
- Three.
- All right.

54:21.559 --> 54:22.810
That was a good one.

54:26.230 --> 54:28.441
- What are you doing?
- I told you to punch me in the face.

54:28.524 --> 54:30.151
- I'm not gonna punch you.
- I told you to!

54:30.234 --> 54:32.153
- I'm not... I'm not gonna...
- I told you to punch me.

54:32.236 --> 54:35.656
Uh, Mary, please.
Hey, Mary, stop.

54:35.740 --> 54:37.408
Why was it so easy for you to move on?

54:37.492 --> 54:39.243
Mary, it wasn't easy. It fucking sucked.

54:39.327 --> 54:41.579
- So why didn't you miss me?
- I did miss you!

54:41.704 --> 54:43.998
Why didn't you write me back?

54:44.081 --> 54:45.750
- Back?
- I wrote you!

54:45.833 --> 54:47.919
Mary, I never got any letters!

54:48.002 --> 54:50.505
- What?
- I never got any letters.

54:52.924 --> 54:54.467
I promise. I swear.

54:55.635 --> 54:57.053
Oh, my God.

54:57.136 --> 55:00.056
I'm so... Oh, my God.

55:02.433 --> 55:04.894
It's okay. Hey, hey, hey.

55:13.945 --> 55:18.533
My dad, Terrence, they stole
all that time from us.

55:23.204 --> 55:24.580
Hey.

55:25.957 --> 55:28.709
We're here right now
and that's all that matters.

55:33.130 --> 55:35.091
- Hmm?
- I'm sorry.

55:36.384 --> 55:38.261
- I'm sorry.
- No, no.

55:38.344 --> 55:39.470
Hey.

55:45.893 --> 55:48.062
- Hello.
- <i>Hello.</i>

55:49.313 --> 55:50.606
Yeah, hello.

55:51.899 --> 55:54.068
<i>Who is this?</i>

55:54.151 --> 55:57.363
I think you have this phone call thing
backwards. You called me.

55:57.488 --> 55:59.115
<i>I'm looking for Mary.</i>

56:00.366 --> 56:02.910
<i>Is everything copacetic over there?</i>

56:05.329 --> 56:07.498
Right as rain, friend.

56:07.582 --> 56:09.333
<i>I'm not your friend.</i>

56:09.417 --> 56:12.044
No? Then why'd you call me?

56:13.045 --> 56:16.173
<i>I'm gonna call you Pinocchio.</i>

56:16.299 --> 56:17.633
And why's that?

56:18.634 --> 56:20.094
<i>He was nosy.</i>

58:09.537 --> 58:12.581
<i>If it's true
that Rathcart Computers were wired</i>

58:12.665 --> 58:18.170
<i>to monitor the activity of high-profile
customers through their built-in cameras,</i>

58:18.254 --> 58:19.714
<i>that could very well be the straw</i>

58:19.797 --> 58:23.426
<i>that finally breaks the back
of the Rathcart Corporation.</i>

58:23.509 --> 58:26.887
<i>We go live now
to a GBN breaking news exclusive.</i>

58:26.971 --> 58:29.890
<i>Multiple shots fired
near the financial district.</i>

58:29.974 --> 58:31.976
<i>Reports of a deadly car crash.</i>

58:32.101 --> 58:33.894
<i>We've got more on this story</i>

58:33.978 --> 58:37.982
<i>and continuing coverage
of the Rathcart scandal as it develops.</i>

59:13.184 --> 59:16.437
Oh, sh...

59:26.280 --> 59:29.283
Wake up, angel. Wake up.

59:46.133 --> 59:48.260
Shh, shh.

01:00:30.469 --> 01:00:31.470
Mm.

01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:40.855
Hi.

01:00:43.607 --> 01:00:45.067
So what do we do now?

01:00:48.779 --> 01:00:49.864
Let's get out of here.

01:00:50.823 --> 01:00:52.241
Sure. Where?

01:00:52.324 --> 01:00:54.285
No, I mean out of this city.

01:00:54.368 --> 01:00:57.621
Let's just get out of here,
away from everything and everyone.

01:00:57.705 --> 01:01:00.791
- Let's go.
- Where would we go?

01:01:01.834 --> 01:01:06.046
You know, I still like Mexico.

01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:07.631
All the fugitives go to Mexico.

01:01:07.715 --> 01:01:08.883
Mm-hmm.

01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:16.056
- We really could. We could, couldn't we?
- Yeah.

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:18.726
We can buy a little spot
on the beach.

01:01:18.809 --> 01:01:22.813
Just lay around in the sun
till we're old and gray.

01:01:22.938 --> 01:01:25.941
- And I'll become a fisherman.
- And I'll open a snack stand.

01:01:26.025 --> 01:01:29.194
And I'll sell fish tacos to tourists.

01:01:32.448 --> 01:01:34.783
He'll try to stop us, you know.

01:01:34.867 --> 01:01:37.202
- Let him try.
- Yeah.

01:01:38.203 --> 01:01:40.623
Well, you don't know my father.

01:01:40.706 --> 01:01:43.500
And you don't know Terrence Uberahl.
He will come looking for me.

01:01:43.584 --> 01:01:45.044
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:01:45.127 --> 01:01:47.963
- Then I'll protect you.
- And I'll protect you.

01:01:50.132 --> 01:01:51.675
For how long?

01:01:51.759 --> 01:01:53.594
For as long as you want me to.

01:01:57.681 --> 01:01:59.224
How about forever?

01:02:06.148 --> 01:02:07.566
Mary Rathcart.

01:02:08.984 --> 01:02:10.152
Yes?

01:02:11.987 --> 01:02:13.989
I'm sick of waiting for my life to start.

01:02:15.824 --> 01:02:18.410
I'm sick of trying so hard
to feel something.

01:02:19.954 --> 01:02:22.623
And you coming back
made me realize I...

01:02:23.874 --> 01:02:25.542
I just wanna be...

01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:27.836
Happy.

01:02:28.963 --> 01:02:29.964
Yeah.

01:02:36.637 --> 01:02:37.721
When?

01:02:39.932 --> 01:02:42.142
There's no time like the present.

01:03:14.717 --> 01:03:15.926
Have a seat.

01:03:19.513 --> 01:03:21.807
You're a lot more colorful
than I expected.

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:27.771
Look, I, um, I came here today
as a professional courtesy.

01:03:27.855 --> 01:03:30.858
This is me being professional,
and there's your courtesy.

01:03:30.941 --> 01:03:33.610
And I just wanna get
straight to the point here, mate.

01:03:33.736 --> 01:03:35.529
Look, you contracted me to do a job,

01:03:35.612 --> 01:03:38.574
you paid in full upfront,
just like I instructed you to do.

01:03:39.616 --> 01:03:41.660
Circumstances have changed

01:03:41.785 --> 01:03:45.998
such that they no longer permit me
to carry out the said job.

01:03:46.999 --> 01:03:52.588
So therefore, here I am
to willingly return my compensation.

01:03:52.671 --> 01:03:54.757
Whoa, what?

01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:57.968
I'm not gonna kill
Pamela Corbett-Ragsdale.

01:03:58.052 --> 01:03:59.803
Your cash is in the bag.

01:03:59.887 --> 01:04:03.807
You can chalk it up
to a recent personal tragedy.

01:04:03.932 --> 01:04:05.809
Now, I've got a new, more pressing job.

01:04:05.893 --> 01:04:09.646
- Hey, if it's about the money...
- It's not about the money, mate.

01:04:11.774 --> 01:04:13.817
There is an angel up there...

01:04:15.861 --> 01:04:17.738
waiting at the gates of Heaven,

01:04:17.821 --> 01:04:21.116
and the password for her entrance
is "revenge."

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:24.578
Hey, listen, if Corbett-Ragsdale makes it
to that interview today,

01:04:24.661 --> 01:04:29.875
there are some very powerful people
that will be awfully upset.

01:04:29.958 --> 01:04:32.544
I get that, mate.

01:04:32.628 --> 01:04:36.090
But I'm pretty fucking upset myself
at the moment.

01:04:36.173 --> 01:04:40.010
And that is why I came here in person,
which I never do,

01:04:40.094 --> 01:04:42.096
to give you enough time
to make other arrangements.

01:04:42.179 --> 01:04:46.016
Oh, enough time! Enough time!

01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:49.561
You've wasted all the time we had!

01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:54.441
Fuck!

01:04:54.525 --> 01:04:57.820
In the brief duration of your employment,

01:04:57.903 --> 01:05:01.865
you have been privy
to some very incriminating information

01:05:01.949 --> 01:05:04.034
and that presents me with an issue.

01:05:05.536 --> 01:05:08.372
Don't go wasting your time
making idle threats there, lollipop.

01:05:09.373 --> 01:05:11.875
I've been in the bloody blood business

01:05:11.959 --> 01:05:14.711
since you were handing out
handjobs at Hanson concerts.

01:05:15.712 --> 01:05:18.215
So I know better than you.

01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:20.300
Loose lips sink ships.

01:05:22.136 --> 01:05:24.054
You won't have no problem from me.

01:05:25.055 --> 01:05:26.932
You've got my word.

01:05:27.015 --> 01:05:30.185
Now, if you'll please excuse me,

01:05:30.269 --> 01:05:32.938
I'm gonna catch a love story
at the local cinema.

01:05:34.815 --> 01:05:37.651
And then I'm gonna track down
a pair of lady Killers.

01:05:44.032 --> 01:05:46.368
What's the name of that painting
you got there on the wall?

01:05:47.578 --> 01:05:49.413
- Fuck you.
- Mm. Good name.

01:06:06.096 --> 01:06:08.807
<i>Gibbon, that son of a bitch,
must have gotten to him.</i>

01:06:08.891 --> 01:06:11.768
Follow the didgeridoo.
Take care of him.

01:06:11.852 --> 01:06:14.980
You find Mary and that Gibbon kid.

01:06:15.063 --> 01:06:16.899
I wanna talk to them personally.

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:21.862
I think we may have
just lost the medicine for our little bug.

01:06:21.945 --> 01:06:23.697
- <i>What's plan B?</i>
- Plan B?

01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:24.990
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:06:25.115 --> 01:06:26.742
There is no plan B.

01:06:26.825 --> 01:06:30.954
<i>I thought I told you to hire the best.
Who the fuck is this guy?</i>

01:06:31.955 --> 01:06:33.957
No, he came highly recommended.

01:06:34.041 --> 01:06:35.751
- I wasn't anticipating, sir...
- <i>Terrence, listen to me.</i>

01:06:35.834 --> 01:06:36.877
- Yes.
- <i>Listen to me.</i>

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:38.378
<i>I am sick of excuses, all right?</i>

01:06:38.462 --> 01:06:40.005
- <i>I am sick of them.</i>
- Yes, sir.

01:06:40.088 --> 01:06:43.217
- <i>Figure this out now.</i>
- I'll handle it myself.

01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:45.302
While... While I have you,

01:06:45.385 --> 01:06:49.223
I seem to have lost track
of Mary during all this.

01:06:49.306 --> 01:06:52.893
I'm beginning to worry and I was hoping
that maybe you had a chance to...

01:06:52.976 --> 01:06:55.729
- <i>Terrence, stop.</i>
- Maybe you had a chance to...

01:06:55.812 --> 01:06:58.357
<i>Terrence, how about you stop
worrying about my daughter</i>

01:06:58.482 --> 01:07:01.485
<i>and focus on silencing Corbett-Ragsdale?</i>

01:07:01.568 --> 01:07:03.779
<i>You know where she is. Now, get it done.</i>

01:07:03.862 --> 01:07:06.240
- <i>I'm coming in.</i>
- Of course.

01:07:25.342 --> 01:07:28.428
<i>I bet your speech was swell.</i>

01:07:30.847 --> 01:07:33.392
<i>Did you tell them that funny story
you told me yesterday?</i>

01:07:33.517 --> 01:07:34.893
<i>No.</i>

01:07:35.018 --> 01:07:38.730
<i>I didn't think of it.
All I could think of was my...</i>

01:07:38.855 --> 01:07:41.608
<i>Fatal errors have
a way of compounding,</i>

01:07:41.692 --> 01:07:44.152
<i>and Terrence Uberahl's
previous mistakes</i>

01:07:44.236 --> 01:07:46.738
<i>were about to inspire yet another.</i>

01:07:46.822 --> 01:07:48.573
<i>...told them that I used
your money, all of it,</i>

01:07:48.657 --> 01:07:51.076
<i>to buy furniture for this apartment.</i>

01:07:51.159 --> 01:07:52.911
<i>That's silly. Your money, my money.</i>

01:07:52.995 --> 01:07:55.122
<i>What difference does it make?
It wasn't very much anyway.</i>

01:07:55.205 --> 01:07:57.958
<i>Maybe I could have told them
the baby has to sleep in the dining room.</i>

01:07:58.041 --> 01:08:00.544
It's only temporary
till we get another apartment.

01:08:11.221 --> 01:08:13.598
You ever seen this movie? Huh?

01:08:15.350 --> 01:08:19.729
It was my Barbie's favorite movie!

01:08:28.488 --> 01:08:30.407
<i>Speak up.
Stand right up to Doolittle.</i>

01:08:30.490 --> 01:08:33.076
<i>Don't ask for your rights.
Demand them.</i>

01:08:34.745 --> 01:08:38.122
<i>Remember the day in
Boston when I got you this ring...</i>

01:08:41.626 --> 01:08:43.295
<i>Well, I don't
want a better one later.</i>

01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:49.593
<i>...one with the diamonds.</i>

01:08:49.676 --> 01:08:51.178
<i>That can wait.</i>

01:08:52.386 --> 01:08:55.640
<i>Yeah, well, I suppose
the mink coat can wait too.</i>

01:10:25.021 --> 01:10:27.399
Why can't you be
a good soldier, huh?

01:10:27.482 --> 01:10:28.984
Huh?!

01:10:48.545 --> 01:10:52.549
Miss Corbett-Ragsdale? I'm
your security detail, here to escort you.

01:10:56.219 --> 01:10:59.055
Hello? Miss Corbett-Ragsdale?

01:11:01.141 --> 01:11:02.976
Miss Co...

01:11:26.208 --> 01:11:29.252
Hello? Ben?

01:11:43.892 --> 01:11:45.560
Is it love?

01:11:45.644 --> 01:11:46.728
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:11:48.522 --> 01:11:51.233
- True love?
- Is there any other kind?

01:11:52.609 --> 01:11:54.110
How do you know?

01:11:56.279 --> 01:11:57.697
I've always known.

01:11:58.823 --> 01:12:00.116
Yeah, me, too.

01:12:01.826 --> 01:12:03.954
When you're young,
you know everything.

01:12:06.706 --> 01:12:08.166
Try not to forget.

01:12:14.047 --> 01:12:18.093
Have you thought about the fallout?
It's not gonna be pretty.

01:12:18.176 --> 01:12:21.555
Don't you think that family rivalries
are a little passé?

01:12:22.722 --> 01:12:27.143
It is going
to take some heavy lifting

01:12:27.269 --> 01:12:28.979
to get our families
together on a wedding.

01:12:29.062 --> 01:12:31.648
- No big wedding.
- No families, no.

01:12:31.773 --> 01:12:35.902
Just thinking about doing a good
old-fashioned shotgun variety, right?

01:12:35.986 --> 01:12:37.571
Yeah. Yeah.

01:12:37.654 --> 01:12:39.739
What, today?

01:12:39.823 --> 01:12:40.824
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

01:12:42.450 --> 01:12:46.329
Benjamin, would you deny your mother
a proper wedding for her only child?

01:12:48.123 --> 01:12:51.084
At the very least, a girl needs a dress
on her wedding day.

01:12:51.167 --> 01:12:52.669
- My son needs a tuxedo.
- Mom...

01:12:52.752 --> 01:12:55.797
- She's wearing a fucking dress.
- Okay, Mrs. Gibbon.

01:12:58.258 --> 01:12:59.843
I'll wear a dress.

01:13:03.013 --> 01:13:05.348
I guess you should get
used to calling me "Mom."

01:13:08.893 --> 01:13:10.895
What about your mother?

01:13:11.021 --> 01:13:13.523
No. No, she wouldn't come anyway.

01:13:14.733 --> 01:13:17.819
Mom, you're the only one
that can know about this.

01:13:18.903 --> 01:13:22.240
But you need a wedding party.

01:13:22.324 --> 01:13:24.367
Don't you have
anyone else you can call?

01:13:26.745 --> 01:13:28.204
Um...

01:14:06.368 --> 01:14:09.663
- Okay.
- I know. It's so exciting.

01:14:09.746 --> 01:14:11.498
Well, I'm hoping
that we have time to do that

01:14:11.581 --> 01:14:13.708
- before everything gets comp...
- Well, wait, wait, wait.

01:14:13.792 --> 01:14:15.335
Well, what...

01:14:17.629 --> 01:14:18.922
Well?

01:14:22.133 --> 01:14:24.386
Thank you for the dress, Mrs. Gibbon.

01:14:25.470 --> 01:14:26.888
It's my pleasure.

01:14:28.682 --> 01:14:30.350
Excuse me for a moment.

01:14:58.753 --> 01:15:00.964
<i>Please leave
a message after the tone.</i>

01:15:01.047 --> 01:15:03.675
Hi, Beatrice. It's Nancy Gibbon calling.

01:15:04.884 --> 01:15:07.345
<i>Your daughter and my son
are getting married today,</i>

01:15:07.429 --> 01:15:10.140
<i>at the church on St. Peter's Street, 5:00,</i>

01:15:10.265 --> 01:15:12.976
<i>and I know that it would mean a lot to her
if her mother was there.</i>

01:15:13.059 --> 01:15:15.270
<i>It's time to leave
this bad blood behind us.</i>

01:15:20.817 --> 01:15:21.901
<i>What do you want?</i>

01:15:21.985 --> 01:15:24.320
<i>What do you know about the wedding?</i>

01:15:24.404 --> 01:15:25.405
What wedding?

01:15:25.488 --> 01:15:27.824
<i>Mary and the Gibbon kid,
they're getting married today.</i>

01:15:33.538 --> 01:15:34.581
What did you say?

01:15:35.665 --> 01:15:37.834
<i>They're getting married. Today.</i>

01:15:45.925 --> 01:15:48.094
Oh, fuck me!

01:16:03.693 --> 01:16:05.195
- It's me.
- <i>What do you want?</i>

01:16:06.196 --> 01:16:07.947
You're all I ever wanted.

01:16:08.031 --> 01:16:12.076
From the moment I laid eyes on you,
it's always been about you.

01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:15.538
<i>I mean, I waited. I bided time.</i>

01:16:15.622 --> 01:16:18.958
I knew that you needed convincing.
I knew that.

01:16:19.042 --> 01:16:20.376
<i>But listen,</i>

01:16:20.502 --> 01:16:23.713
<i>I think I might have gotten myself
into a little bit of hot water here.</i>

01:16:25.048 --> 01:16:27.300
I think my big city days are done.

01:16:28.551 --> 01:16:31.054
I'm skipping town, babe,
and you're coming with me.

01:16:31.137 --> 01:16:33.264
- Terrence...
- <i>I need you to understand something.</i>

01:16:33.389 --> 01:16:36.726
If you would just give me a chance,

01:16:36.810 --> 01:16:40.688
<i>I can make you so happy.</i>

01:16:53.076 --> 01:16:53.910
Okay.

01:16:55.078 --> 01:16:55.912
Okay.

01:17:00.208 --> 01:17:02.752
I've been wanting to tell you something,

01:17:02.836 --> 01:17:04.838
but I don't wanna ruin the mood.

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:09.133
Someone called last night.

01:17:09.217 --> 01:17:12.262
A guy. Looking for Mary.

01:17:14.347 --> 01:17:15.723
He was...

01:17:20.770 --> 01:17:22.105
troubling.

01:17:24.774 --> 01:17:27.610
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

01:17:35.326 --> 01:17:39.789
Do you remember the first time we met?
Remember what you called it?

01:17:42.083 --> 01:17:43.042
Fate.

01:17:44.043 --> 01:17:45.837
By way of random chaos.

01:17:51.885 --> 01:17:54.721
I'm just letting what's meant to be, be.

01:18:05.523 --> 01:18:07.567
Hey.

01:18:08.568 --> 01:18:11.779
You're not supposed to see me
in my dress. It's bad luck.

01:18:11.863 --> 01:18:14.449
I'll take my chances.
You look so beautiful.

01:18:21.456 --> 01:18:25.043
It's the moment of truth.
Are you sure you wanna do this?

01:18:25.126 --> 01:18:28.880
- I'm sure. Are you?
- I'm positive.

01:18:32.008 --> 01:18:34.177
What's the worst thing
that could happen?

01:18:50.151 --> 01:18:52.737
- <i>William.</i>
- Terrence.

01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:55.198
Thank God. Where are you?

01:18:55.281 --> 01:18:57.408
- <i>You knew about this, didn't you?</i>
- Slow down.

01:18:57.492 --> 01:19:00.703
- <i>Huh? The wedding!</i>
- I don't know what you're talking about.

01:19:00.787 --> 01:19:03.581
- <i>Mary and the Gibbon kid?</i>
- I swear.

01:19:03.665 --> 01:19:07.210
<i>St. Peter's Street.
Why did you let this happen?</i>

01:19:07.335 --> 01:19:09.545
- I had no idea.
- <i>I'm going down there.</i>

01:19:09.671 --> 01:19:11.214
<i>I'm gonna find that son of a bitch!</i>

01:19:11.297 --> 01:19:12.715
I don't think you wanna do that, Terrence.

01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:15.677
- <i>Too late!</i>
- Listen to me. We can figure this out.

01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:17.387
Terre... Hello.

01:19:17.470 --> 01:19:19.973
Terrence? Terrence?

01:19:28.564 --> 01:19:31.359
- Where is that rat-fuck headed?
- A chapel downtown.

01:19:33.069 --> 01:19:34.487
My daughter's getting married.

01:19:35.488 --> 01:19:36.322
Aw.

01:19:38.741 --> 01:19:39.909
Well, let's go.

01:19:41.077 --> 01:19:42.578
You're taking me with you?

01:19:45.498 --> 01:19:47.208
It's your baby girl's wedding.

01:19:54.298 --> 01:19:55.675
Here we are, guys.

01:19:56.968 --> 01:19:59.012
I prepared a little something.

01:20:01.556 --> 01:20:06.894
Welcome to this beautiful union
between these two people...

01:20:09.605 --> 01:20:13.359
in this beautiful space, together.

01:20:16.112 --> 01:20:17.613
Thank you.

01:20:17.697 --> 01:20:19.574
Stunning, both of you.

01:20:21.367 --> 01:20:24.704
In the Judeo-Christian Creation myth,

01:20:25.788 --> 01:20:28.124
Adam and Eve are banished from the Garden

01:20:28.207 --> 01:20:30.543
for disobeying God's sacred laws.

01:20:31.544 --> 01:20:33.838
But I invite you to consider,

01:20:33.921 --> 01:20:36.799
while they knew nothing
but beauty in the Garden,

01:20:38.634 --> 01:20:41.137
they did not know love

01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:43.097
until they were forced to face

01:20:43.181 --> 01:20:46.976
the ugliness
of the outside world together.

01:20:48.144 --> 01:20:52.148
They clung to each other
in the face of a vicious world,

01:20:53.316 --> 01:20:58.071
and, in so doing,
gave birth to love itself.

01:21:10.249 --> 01:21:11.584
Terrence.

01:21:13.628 --> 01:21:15.254
Hello, Mary.

01:21:17.757 --> 01:21:19.509
You don't wanna do this.

01:21:19.592 --> 01:21:21.177
Nobody move.

01:21:23.471 --> 01:21:25.681
You broke my heart.

01:21:25.807 --> 01:21:28.184
- Terrence...
- I protected you.

01:21:28.267 --> 01:21:30.937
Just put the gun down.
It's not too late.

01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:33.231
It was always too late!

01:21:35.566 --> 01:21:36.400
Huh?

01:21:37.610 --> 01:21:38.903
- Terrence!
- No!

01:21:38.986 --> 01:21:40.863
- You.
- No! No!

01:21:40.947 --> 01:21:41.864
Hey! Hey!

01:21:42.865 --> 01:21:44.492
- Ben! Ben!
- No, no.

01:21:45.493 --> 01:21:47.328
It was always about you.

01:21:47.411 --> 01:21:53.543
I had to listen to her sob stories
about you over and over and over again.

01:21:53.626 --> 01:21:56.796
I was fucking sick of you
before I even met you.

01:21:56.879 --> 01:21:58.297
- Yeah.
- No.

01:21:58.381 --> 01:22:00.633
Back up! Back up!

01:22:00.716 --> 01:22:02.385
- Terrence, please!
- Stay back!

01:22:02.468 --> 01:22:04.095
Please! Please.

01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:06.389
- Shh...
- Stop! Stop.

01:22:06.472 --> 01:22:08.015
No.

01:22:09.308 --> 01:22:11.936
Don't hurt him! Don't hurt him!

01:22:12.019 --> 01:22:13.020
Ben!

01:22:14.355 --> 01:22:15.565
Ben!

01:22:16.941 --> 01:22:20.403
Don't you know the penalty for hunting
in the King's forest is death?

01:22:39.922 --> 01:22:42.383
You call this a man, huh?

01:22:42.466 --> 01:22:44.802
Look at me. I'm a man.

01:22:46.888 --> 01:22:47.889
Give me that.

01:22:57.106 --> 01:22:58.691
Give me the gun.

01:23:04.947 --> 01:23:06.115
Wayne?

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:08.409
Rabbit?

01:23:08.492 --> 01:23:10.620
You got your wallet. Right? Eh?

01:23:12.955 --> 01:23:13.956
What?

01:23:20.755 --> 01:23:23.633
All right, could everybody
please sit down? Come on.

01:23:23.716 --> 01:23:25.343
Come on, now. Chop chop.

01:23:26.844 --> 01:23:29.972
Not on the floor, ladies.
You'll ruin your bloody dresses.

01:23:30.056 --> 01:23:31.641
Sit in the pews.

01:23:31.766 --> 01:23:33.226
Come on.

01:23:33.309 --> 01:23:35.228
Including you, sunshine.

01:23:35.311 --> 01:23:36.979
I'll take it from here.

01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:39.649
Yeah, yeah, sit, sit. Good boy.

01:23:40.983 --> 01:23:43.527
- Is this your wedding?
- Yeah.

01:23:46.197 --> 01:23:47.490
Congratulations, mate.

01:23:48.449 --> 01:23:50.952
Hey. What are you doing here?

01:23:52.578 --> 01:23:55.039
Well, as fate would have it,

01:23:55.122 --> 01:23:57.541
I reckon we got ourselves
a common enemy.

01:23:57.625 --> 01:23:58.834
Let him up.

01:24:00.294 --> 01:24:01.379
Get up.

01:24:06.425 --> 01:24:09.011
I'm not gonna let you ruin
this love story.

01:24:11.973 --> 01:24:13.349
All right.

01:24:16.852 --> 01:24:20.398
Ladies, you might wanna look away.

01:24:26.529 --> 01:24:27.780
This is for my angel.

01:24:37.873 --> 01:24:40.960
Oh, shit.

01:24:52.596 --> 01:24:54.557
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Freeze!

01:25:06.819 --> 01:25:09.030
Keep your eyes on the prize, Rabbit.

01:25:19.165 --> 01:25:21.125
Put the gun down!

01:25:29.133 --> 01:25:31.010
Put the gun down, Terrence.

01:25:32.136 --> 01:25:33.262
Mary.

01:25:35.306 --> 01:25:36.307
<i>C'est la vie.</i>

01:25:37.808 --> 01:25:39.352
- No!
- No!

01:25:41.604 --> 01:25:44.190
No!

01:25:51.530 --> 01:25:55.701
<i>For Ben, the moment
lasted a lifetime.</i>

01:25:56.702 --> 01:25:59.330
<i>But his life didn't
flash before his eyes.</i>

01:25:59.455 --> 01:26:03.000
<i>Instead, his mind traveled to the memory
of a childhood toy,</i>

01:26:03.084 --> 01:26:06.629
<i>a red View-Master he received
for his fifth birthday.</i>

01:26:06.712 --> 01:26:11.175
<i>As a boy, Ben spent hours flipping
through pictures of miraculous things</i>

01:26:11.258 --> 01:26:14.095
<i>and momentous periods
of human history.</i>

01:26:14.178 --> 01:26:16.138
<i>Though too young
to understand it at the time,</i>

01:26:16.222 --> 01:26:19.475
<i>Ben was struck
by the seemingly impossible fact</i>

01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:22.812
<i>that these were images of real things</i>

01:26:22.895 --> 01:26:27.775
<i>and that they were all mere specks
of a cataclysmically immense reality</i>

01:26:27.858 --> 01:26:31.779
<i>he could never fully grasp or even accept.</i>

01:26:31.862 --> 01:26:34.532
<i>He remembered feeling weightless.</i>

01:26:34.657 --> 01:26:37.868
<i>He had contemplated
this moment many times.</i>

01:26:37.952 --> 01:26:39.995
<i>He had dreamt up countless scenarios.</i>

01:26:40.079 --> 01:26:42.706
<i>He had imagined many good deaths.</i>

01:26:42.790 --> 01:26:46.085
<i>But he couldn't remember any of them now.</i>

01:26:46.168 --> 01:26:49.797
<i>Instead, he thought of Mary.</i>

01:27:08.190 --> 01:27:09.483
Hey.

01:27:11.444 --> 01:27:13.154
Ben. Ben!

01:27:53.861 --> 01:27:54.862
Hey, hey.

01:27:54.945 --> 01:27:55.988
Hey.

01:27:56.989 --> 01:27:57.948
Hey.

01:27:58.032 --> 01:28:00.409
Stay with me. Ben.

01:28:03.412 --> 01:28:05.539
I didn't get to say, "I do."

01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:10.920
I do, too.

01:28:20.262 --> 01:28:23.849
<i>Ben had always imagined
that, in some shape or form,</i>

01:28:23.933 --> 01:28:25.476

<i>He would have gone down in history
as an incorrigible rascal</i>

01:28:28.896 --> 01:28:31.315

01:28:31.398 --> 01:28:33.275
<i>Death makes for good punctuation,</i>

01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:36.195

01:28:51.835 --> 01:28:55.297
<i>and stick us with a happy ending.</i>
