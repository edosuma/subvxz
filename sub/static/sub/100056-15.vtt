WEBVTT

00:03.002 --> 00:05.213
Would you rather have two noses
or a third arm on your back?

00:05.296 --> 00:07.382
Oh, God.

00:05.296 --> 00:07.382
Do both noses work?

00:07.465 --> 00:08.758
Yeah. Identical noses.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.468
Full-size arm
or baby arm?

00:10.552 --> 00:13.221
What use would a baby arm
on your back be?

00:13.304 --> 00:15.056
You're doctors.

00:15.140 --> 00:17.475
Hey, Carol, would you rather
listen to Lexie and Caleb play

00:17.559 --> 00:19.894
"would you rather" or
waterslide into a wood chipper?

00:19.978 --> 00:21.104
Oh, wood chipper.

00:21.187 --> 00:23.314
Guys, I have great news.

00:23.398 --> 00:25.734
Eddie is number two on
the wait list for his new liver.

00:25.817 --> 00:27.610
Oh, that's great.
I love Eddie.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.112
The man stole my heart.

00:29.195 --> 00:31.072
He probably
should've stolen my liver.

00:31.156 --> 00:32.574
So I have this
great thing planned

00:32.657 --> 00:34.200
for when I get to tell
Eddie the good news.

00:34.284 --> 00:36.745
I brought a homemade banner,
a homemade card

00:36.828 --> 00:39.414
and I baked a
liver-shaped cake.

00:39.497 --> 00:41.833
But the best gift of all

00:41.916 --> 00:43.918
is that Eddie has a meeting
with his transplant surgeon.

00:44.002 --> 00:45.170
He's taking over
as primary.

00:45.253 --> 00:46.671
It's Dr. Lewis, right?

00:45.253 --> 00:46.671
Yeah.

00:46.755 --> 00:48.423
He is the best transplant
surgeon on the West Coast.

00:48.506 --> 00:49.924
That man's a legend.

00:48.506 --> 00:49.924
LEXIE:
Ugh.

00:50.008 --> 00:51.092
If you're so in love
with surgeons,

00:51.176 --> 00:53.303
go sit with the
surgery interns.

00:53.386 --> 00:55.138
CALEB:
He'd never fit in.

00:55.221 --> 00:56.181
That's the cool
kids table.

00:56.264 --> 01:00.143
Yo, I'm cool. I just don't
feel like talking to them.

01:00.226 --> 01:03.021
Totally could, though.
I just don't feel like it.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.816
Guys, come on. It's not
nice to stereotype people.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.818
No, but it does
save a lot of time.

01:08.902 --> 01:11.154
Plus, it's not all
negative stereotyping.

01:11.237 --> 01:13.865
The OB-GYN crew is badass.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.701
They look like
they're smoking,

01:16.785 --> 01:19.287
but they're not smoking.

01:19.370 --> 01:22.165
I guess I do have
my own stereotypes.

01:22.248 --> 01:24.876
The morgue interns
kind of creep me out.

01:27.128 --> 01:29.214
I mean, I get it. You're
around dead bodies all day.

01:29.297 --> 01:32.884
But that doesn't mean you
can't wear a pop of color.

01:32.967 --> 01:34.719
The nurses are the
ones to watch out for.

01:34.803 --> 01:37.180
They're powerful
and they know it.

01:37.263 --> 01:39.349
Okay, so,

01:39.432 --> 01:42.852
if we're not jocks or goths
or badasses, what are we?

01:42.936 --> 01:44.020
Nerds.

01:45.480 --> 01:46.731
You're nerds.

01:48.608 --> 01:51.861
♪ ♪

01:51.945 --> 01:52.987
(beep)

01:58.243 --> 02:00.161
I'm nervous about
meeting my surgeon.

02:00.245 --> 02:01.871
Do I look all right?

02:01.955 --> 02:04.707
Should I look sicker?

02:01.955 --> 02:04.707
(laughs softly)

02:04.791 --> 02:07.585
Don't be nervous. Dr. Lewis
has an excellent reputation.

02:07.669 --> 02:09.546
As long as he doesn't stick
a kidney in my liver hole,

02:09.629 --> 02:10.797
I'll be good.

02:09.629 --> 02:10.797
(chuckles):
Okay.

02:12.841 --> 02:15.760
Dr. Lewis, it's really exciting
meeting you.

02:15.844 --> 02:17.929
I'm Dr. Kenney,

02:18.012 --> 02:21.391
and this, of course, is the
man of the hour, Eddie Ryan.

02:21.474 --> 02:23.560
So, welcome to
Team Eddie.

02:27.021 --> 02:28.815
Eddie likes
long walks on the beach

02:28.898 --> 02:31.109
and having a functioning liver,

02:31.192 --> 02:33.570
(laughs): so you guys are
gonna get along great.

02:33.653 --> 02:37.115
He has a mild leukocytosis.
Monitor that.

02:37.198 --> 02:39.784
Yes, I know. Actually, I was
gonna tell you all about it

02:39.868 --> 02:41.619
just as soon as you made
eye contact.

02:41.703 --> 02:43.246
(phone vibrates)

02:44.497 --> 02:46.416
Mr. Ryan, you just got bumped up

02:46.499 --> 02:48.668
to number one
on the transplant list.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.254
The next available liver
will be yours.

02:51.337 --> 02:53.298
(chuckles):
Oh.

02:53.381 --> 02:55.258
Th-That's amazing.

02:55.341 --> 02:57.135
Yeah.

02:55.341 --> 02:57.135
Carol, isn't that amazing?

02:57.218 --> 02:58.636
This is the news
we've been waiting for.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.597
It's amazing news.

03:00.680 --> 03:01.806
The kind of news one might make

03:01.890 --> 03:04.475
a big deal
out of telling someone.

03:04.559 --> 03:06.603
(sighs)
One second, Eddie.

03:07.896 --> 03:10.773
Kind of thought
there'd be a cake.

03:12.191 --> 03:13.526
Dr. Lewis?

03:13.610 --> 03:14.652
Yes?

03:14.736 --> 03:16.154
Um, I just wanted to make sure

03:16.237 --> 03:17.739
that you were finished
with the patient.

03:17.822 --> 03:21.200
I thought I indicated that
when I left the room.

03:22.410 --> 03:23.494
Okay, but...

03:23.578 --> 03:25.455
What is it, Doctor?

03:23.578 --> 03:25.455
Uh, it's just,

03:25.538 --> 03:27.373
I would've appreciated
a heads-up about Eddie

03:27.457 --> 03:29.584
getting to the top
of the transplant list.

03:29.667 --> 03:31.669
I have a liver cake for him.

03:33.338 --> 03:36.007
I generally don't withhold
vital medical information

03:36.090 --> 03:38.718
until a cake can be wheeled in.

03:36.090 --> 03:38.718
Oh...

03:38.801 --> 03:41.054
I-I don't think you understand.

03:41.137 --> 03:43.640
The cake is delivering
the information.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.643
Okay. As I walk away this time,

03:46.726 --> 03:49.729
I hope you understand
that our interaction is over.

03:52.732 --> 03:54.901
Can you believe that guy?

03:52.732 --> 03:54.901
(chuckles):
Yeah.

03:57.070 --> 04:00.949
Now, if I were an uneaten slice
of liver cake, where might I be?

04:01.950 --> 04:02.992
Doctors' lounge.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.702
Thank you.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.093
(panting)

04:20.176 --> 04:21.678
Guys.

04:21.761 --> 04:24.514
Huge news. I ran here
as fast as I could to tell you.

04:24.597 --> 04:27.183
Oh, you won't believe this.
It's amazing.

04:27.266 --> 04:29.686
You finally got a haircut
that doesn't upset you?

04:29.769 --> 04:31.521
DANIEL:
No.

04:31.604 --> 04:32.563
That can't be it.

04:32.647 --> 04:36.192
Get ready to have
your ears blasted.

04:36.275 --> 04:38.736
Dr. Jacobs has a tattoo.

04:39.779 --> 04:41.239
A tattoo?

04:39.779 --> 04:41.239
Dr. Jacobs?

04:41.322 --> 04:42.657
That's not even the best part.

04:42.740 --> 04:45.493
Her very secret tattoo
is a duck.

04:45.576 --> 04:46.744
A duck?

04:45.576 --> 04:46.744
A duck.

04:46.828 --> 04:47.870
Like, a cartoon duck?

04:47.954 --> 04:49.080
Like, a quack, quack duck.

04:49.163 --> 04:49.914
A mallard duck?

04:49.998 --> 04:51.541
Like, a straight-up
mallard duck!

04:51.624 --> 04:53.876
Whoa. That<i> is</i> weird.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.545
A-And I don't say
that with judgment.

04:55.628 --> 04:57.547
I say that as a person
who is objectively

04:57.630 --> 04:59.007
considered quite weird.

05:00.299 --> 05:02.760
Why would Dr. Jacobs
get a tattoo of a duck?

05:02.844 --> 05:04.679
I have no idea.

05:04.762 --> 05:07.348
A roaring lion on your chest,
that I get.

05:07.432 --> 05:09.225
A duck is just bizarre.

05:10.268 --> 05:11.602
This is huge news.

05:11.686 --> 05:14.272
We know almost nothing
about Dr. Jacobs.

05:14.355 --> 05:16.024
Yeah, she's an enigma.
We've worked with her

05:16.107 --> 05:17.775
for months
and all we know about her

05:17.859 --> 05:21.612
is that she lives
in the United States.

05:21.696 --> 05:23.114
What could the duck
possibly mean?

05:23.197 --> 05:25.116
Oh, I'm gonna make it
my life's mission to find out.

05:25.199 --> 05:26.617
This is too good.

05:26.701 --> 05:28.036
What's too good?

05:28.119 --> 05:29.871
Three-cheese pizza.

05:29.954 --> 05:32.331
You know, two-cheese is fine,
then they throw in that third

05:32.415 --> 05:34.959
and it's just... too good.

05:36.544 --> 05:38.755
Rounds. Let's move.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.052
Eddie, I'm a
little concerned.

05:44.135 --> 05:46.054
You're still running
a low-grade fever,

05:46.137 --> 05:47.430
and your white cell count
is a little higher

05:47.513 --> 05:48.556
than I'm comfortable with.

05:48.639 --> 05:51.768
Oh, no. Do you think
I have to go to the hospital?

05:53.728 --> 05:55.104
(door opens)

05:55.188 --> 05:57.565
Dr. Kenney, why'd
you page me?

05:57.648 --> 05:59.317
I'm treating Eddie for a UTI...

05:59.400 --> 06:01.944
Well, this could jeopardize
his recipient status.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.614
Yes, I know. That's why I...

06:02.028 --> 06:04.614
Why am I only hearing
about this now?

06:04.697 --> 06:05.782
CAROL:
Well, so far,
it's been resistant

06:05.865 --> 06:07.116
to the usual antibiotics.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.576
That's why I paged you.

06:08.659 --> 06:09.952
Then why don't we look
for some antibiotics

06:10.036 --> 06:11.079
that it won't be resistant to?

06:11.162 --> 06:12.789
Or hadn't that occurred to you?

06:12.872 --> 06:16.459
Actually, it had, and I've
already begun researching...

06:16.542 --> 06:20.171
This is why I don't want an
intern in charge of my patient.

06:20.254 --> 06:22.340
I'm sorry, "your patient"?

06:23.883 --> 06:25.051
You're an intern?

06:29.889 --> 06:31.265
Patient presents
with abdominal pain,

06:31.349 --> 06:33.434
dizziness and
shortness of breath.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.603
I'm such a klutz.
I was trimming my fig tree,

06:35.686 --> 06:36.979
and I fell off my ladder.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.481
Bonked my head on a tree branch.

06:38.564 --> 06:41.734
Oh, no. I bet you wish
you would've ducked.

06:43.402 --> 06:45.488
We should run
a concussion protocol.

06:45.571 --> 06:47.448
Yeah, my wife's always
telling me to slow down,

06:47.532 --> 06:49.492
but I didn't want
to miss the game.

06:49.575 --> 06:51.661
Oh, there was a game on?
Was it hockey?

06:51.744 --> 06:53.329
I just love the Anaheim Ducks.

06:53.412 --> 06:55.164
(chuckles)

06:55.248 --> 06:56.457
I don't see how that's relevant.

06:56.541 --> 06:59.669
Uh, no, I was trying to get to
my son Owen's basketball game.

06:59.752 --> 07:02.547
Oh. When I was a kid, I loved
playing Duck, Duck, Goose.

07:02.630 --> 07:05.842
Did any of you enjoy
playing Duck, Duck, Goose?

07:05.925 --> 07:07.552
LEXIE:
Why do they call it

07:07.635 --> 07:09.887
Duck, Duck, Goose?
Ducks can chase each other.

07:09.971 --> 07:12.348
They should call it
Duck, Duck, Duck.

07:12.431 --> 07:14.350
Maybe I did
hit my head too hard.

07:14.433 --> 07:16.394
I'm suddenly hearing
the word "duck" a lot.

07:16.477 --> 07:18.855
We'll order a CT
to make sure

07:18.938 --> 07:20.606
nothing else is
going on, Mr. Turner.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.567
But I'm sure you'll
be home in no time.

07:22.650 --> 07:25.153
Let's move.

07:27.488 --> 07:29.949
What is the matter
with you people?

07:30.032 --> 07:32.577
You're all acting
very weird.

07:32.660 --> 07:34.245
Even more than usual.

07:34.328 --> 07:37.790
I'm fine. One might
even say I'm ducky.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.502
Just order the CT.

07:44.005 --> 07:45.673
I thought we were
pretty subtle.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.595
Hey, good news,
Dr. Frost.

07:50.678 --> 07:52.263
I think I've found
the perfect treatment

07:52.346 --> 07:54.390
for Eddie's infection:
cefiderocol.

07:54.473 --> 07:58.102
Ooh. That's cutting-edge
medicine, Dr. Kenney.

07:58.186 --> 07:59.270
Thank you.
I'm glad you think so.

07:59.353 --> 08:00.855
I'll write the order.

08:00.938 --> 08:04.025
Oh, you'll need to get
Dr. Lewis's approval first.

08:04.108 --> 08:05.943
I once didn't consult with him
about a procedure,

08:06.027 --> 08:09.030
and he put it
in his Christmas card.

08:09.113 --> 08:10.865
Christmas cards
aren't for pettiness.

08:10.948 --> 08:13.743
They're for lying about
your children's accomplishments.

08:15.036 --> 08:16.996
Exactly.

08:15.036 --> 08:16.996
Yeah.

08:17.079 --> 08:19.790
Well, Dennis,
we have a plan.

08:19.874 --> 08:21.751
I'll get the approval
of Dr. Lewis, and show him

08:21.834 --> 08:23.753
that I am more
than just an intern.

08:23.836 --> 08:27.048
And if he happens to acknowledge
that I'm a pretty good doctor,

08:27.131 --> 08:29.300
well, I won't be mad at that.

08:27.131 --> 08:29.300
Mm.

08:29.383 --> 08:32.303
Well, he's scheduled to cut out
someone's liver in ten minutes.

08:32.386 --> 08:35.765
Can you wait seven hours
to get your mild apology?

08:36.807 --> 08:38.267
No, I can't.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.652
Dr. Lewis?

08:51.530 --> 08:53.491
Can you take those off?

08:53.574 --> 08:54.617
Oh, sorry.

08:54.700 --> 08:55.952
Uh...

08:56.035 --> 08:58.162
Dr. Kenney,
what is happening here?

08:58.246 --> 09:00.957
I'm minutes away from performing
a partial hepatectomy.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.124
Yeah, yeah. I-I just
need you to sign off

09:02.208 --> 09:03.167
on a treatment for Eddie.

09:03.251 --> 09:04.627
I believe I have found

09:04.710 --> 09:06.462
the perfect antibiotic.

09:06.545 --> 09:08.297
Cefiderocol.

09:11.550 --> 09:15.429
Just blink once
if this pleases you.

09:15.513 --> 09:17.431
That should work.

09:17.515 --> 09:18.808
Great.

09:18.891 --> 09:20.184
It's a pretty good idea, right?

09:20.268 --> 09:21.519
Especially for an intern.

09:21.602 --> 09:23.145
People are talking.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.481
I believe the phrase
"cutting-edge" was used.

09:25.564 --> 09:28.109
Yeah. It's a lot of buzz.

09:28.192 --> 09:29.235
Buzz.

09:28.192 --> 09:29.235
Mm-hmm.

09:29.318 --> 09:32.446
For an antibiotic that
you haven't administered yet?

09:32.530 --> 09:33.823
(laughs):
I know.

09:33.906 --> 09:36.784
It's crazy, but it's true.

09:36.867 --> 09:39.370
So...

09:39.453 --> 09:41.831
Yeah.

09:41.914 --> 09:43.499
I'm sorry.

09:43.582 --> 09:45.918
D-Do you expect praise
for doing your job correctly?

09:46.002 --> 09:47.962
Yes, thank you.

09:48.045 --> 09:50.214
A note for the future.

09:50.298 --> 09:52.508
Yanking things out of my ears
before surgery is not the way

09:52.591 --> 09:54.010
to get me to compliment you.

09:54.093 --> 09:56.846
Well, actually,
it's not about the recognition.

09:56.929 --> 09:59.015
This is a positive
development for Eddie,

09:59.098 --> 10:01.517
and frankly,
you just don't seem interested.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.853
No, I am not interested.
I am irritated.

10:03.936 --> 10:05.896
You have interrupted
my scrub-in, you're emotional,

10:05.980 --> 10:07.815
you took my earbuds out...

10:07.898 --> 10:09.650
and your tiny hands
are freezing.

10:16.615 --> 10:17.616
I've got it.

10:17.700 --> 10:20.328
The duck represents her need
to always keep swimming

10:20.411 --> 10:22.455
through life's
many challenges.

10:22.538 --> 10:25.708
Or she grew up
near a pond.

10:25.791 --> 10:28.002
You're sure the tattoo
wasn't Donald Duck?

10:28.085 --> 10:29.837
Oh, right, I guess
I was just confused

10:29.920 --> 10:31.547
the first four times
you asked me.

10:31.630 --> 10:34.383
It was just a stupid,
boring duck.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.885
Was it Daffy Duck?

10:35.968 --> 10:37.970
I'm gonna kill you.

10:40.806 --> 10:43.100
Dr. Lewis is the worst.
I mean, "emotional"?

10:43.184 --> 10:44.894
I'm as cool
as a cucumber.

10:44.977 --> 10:48.189
And by the way, having emotions
makes me a better doctor.

10:48.272 --> 10:51.192
I'm sorry I'm not
a block of soap.

10:51.275 --> 10:53.694
A what?

10:51.275 --> 10:53.694
I don't know!
I'm emotional!

10:55.446 --> 10:57.281
Dr. Kenney, can I
speak with you?

10:58.157 --> 10:59.033
(clears throat)

10:59.116 --> 11:01.535
I'm afraid that
Dr. Lewis has requested

11:01.619 --> 11:03.746
that you be removed
from Eddie's case.

11:03.829 --> 11:06.248
What the bleep?!

11:07.708 --> 11:09.877
Uh, did you just
bleep yourself?

11:09.960 --> 11:13.631
Yeah, 'cause what I was thinking
really needed to be censored.

11:14.548 --> 11:16.384
Try me.

11:16.467 --> 11:18.469
(whispers)

11:18.552 --> 11:20.805
Carol, "heck" is not
a bad word.

11:18.552 --> 11:20.805
Well...

11:25.851 --> 11:27.895
How dare he try
and take Eddie away from me.

11:27.978 --> 11:29.772
I have been by Eddie's side
since day one.

11:29.855 --> 11:31.148
He's my patient.

11:31.232 --> 11:33.317
Dr. Kenney,
I'm gonna confide in you.

11:33.401 --> 11:34.902
When it comes to
Dr. Lewis,

11:34.985 --> 11:37.279
he's not my favorite
person in the hospital.

11:37.363 --> 11:39.031
Dr. Frost,

11:39.115 --> 11:41.325
I have never heard you
speak so harshly.

11:41.409 --> 11:43.327
Well, he's always rubbed me
the wrong way.

11:43.411 --> 11:46.080
I find him to be rude
and self-absorbed.

11:46.163 --> 11:49.083
Yes. I'm pretty sure he
cut me off in the parking lot,

11:49.166 --> 11:51.085
and he did not even have
the human decency

11:51.168 --> 11:52.920
to give me
the little sorry wave.

11:53.003 --> 11:54.505
No sorry wave?

11:53.003 --> 11:54.505
No.

11:54.588 --> 11:56.424
Monstrous!

11:56.507 --> 11:58.467
I'll bet he doesn't recycle.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.803
I'll bet he throws his cans
straight into the ocean.

12:00.886 --> 12:04.140
And yet, everyone
in this hospital is convinced

12:04.223 --> 12:05.641
he's some kind of genius.

12:04.223 --> 12:05.641
(sighs)

12:05.724 --> 12:07.351
Let me tell you something.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.478
You want to keep a secret
from a surgeon,

12:09.562 --> 12:12.481
all you have to do
is put it in a book.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.191
'Cause they don't read.

12:14.275 --> 12:15.651
BOTH:
Ha-ha!

12:15.734 --> 12:16.986
You know what, Dr. Kenney?

12:17.069 --> 12:18.904
I'm not taking you
off Eddie's case.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.656
I think Dr. Lewis could

12:20.739 --> 12:23.325
learn a thing or two
about patient care from you.

12:23.409 --> 12:26.620
And a thing or two about
being charming from a rock.

12:28.080 --> 12:31.000
Dr. Frost, I've never seen
this side of you.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.334
And I love it.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.962
Well, call me "Tabby,"

12:35.045 --> 12:37.423
'cause I can get
pretty catty.

12:35.045 --> 12:37.423
Ooh.

12:40.801 --> 12:44.513
Dr. Lewis, you have
some kind of nerve

12:44.597 --> 12:45.890
trying to-- Holy cow.

12:45.973 --> 12:47.725
Is this the
surgeons' lounge?

12:47.808 --> 12:49.185
Oh, my God.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.562
It is so nice in here.

12:51.645 --> 12:52.563
(gasps)

12:52.646 --> 12:54.565
Is this cashmere?

12:54.648 --> 12:58.152
All we have is a sleeping bag
called "the rash".

12:58.235 --> 13:00.821
Dr. Kenney, not now.
I'm not in the mood.

13:00.905 --> 13:03.407
My partial hepatectomy did not
go as smoothly as hoped.

13:03.491 --> 13:06.076
We had to take out a lot
more tissue than expected.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.537
I'm concerned about
his recovery.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.498
So you do care about
your patients.

13:10.581 --> 13:13.334
Well, of course I care
about my patients.

13:13.417 --> 13:15.669
The whole reason I became
a doctor was to save lives.

13:15.753 --> 13:17.171
Well, where was this guy
with Eddie?

13:17.254 --> 13:18.756
Or in the parking lot yesterday.

13:18.839 --> 13:20.674
You drive a red Mercedes, right?

13:20.758 --> 13:23.427
Dr. Kenney, I'm a surgeon, of
course I drive a red Mercedes.

13:23.511 --> 13:27.181
I also cut people open
and replace their parts.

13:27.264 --> 13:28.724
And if I do it well, they live.

13:28.807 --> 13:31.185
And if I don't, they die.

13:31.268 --> 13:34.021
You know, I really
care about Eddie,

13:34.104 --> 13:36.607
so how often would you say
you do it well?

13:38.609 --> 13:40.069
I can tell that
you care about him.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.196
And that's actually why
I wanted you off his case.

13:42.279 --> 13:44.740
I can't afford
to get emotional,

13:44.823 --> 13:46.200
because it could distract me
during surgery.

13:46.283 --> 13:48.285
And if I make a mistake,
that's it.

13:48.369 --> 13:50.371
So it's not that I don't care
about my patients,

13:50.454 --> 13:51.914
it's just I don't have
that luxury.

13:51.997 --> 13:55.709
I'm sorry, it seems
I've misjudged you.

13:55.793 --> 13:57.378
In my defense,
I was just going off

13:57.461 --> 13:58.921
your appearance and behavior.

14:01.006 --> 14:04.260
I know, I can be
a little brusque.

14:04.343 --> 14:06.595
So, as a token
of my apology,

14:06.679 --> 14:08.264
please take this.

14:08.347 --> 14:10.099
I don't know if it's cashmere,

14:10.182 --> 14:11.725
but I do know
that it's disease-free.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.229
Thank you.

14:15.312 --> 14:17.398
Anything else?

14:17.481 --> 14:19.441
Yes.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.318
Good catch with the cefiderocol.

14:22.528 --> 14:23.737
You're a pretty good doctor.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.781
Thank you, but I was angling

14:25.864 --> 14:27.449
for the charcuterie tray.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.076
Oh.

14:35.874 --> 14:38.419
Dr. Gilani, thank you
for meeting me.

14:38.502 --> 14:40.421
I need your professional
opinion.

14:40.504 --> 14:42.298
Can you take a look
at this mole?

14:42.381 --> 14:44.466
Mole? Right. Sure.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.093
Um...

14:46.176 --> 14:47.803
It does look a bit raised.

14:47.886 --> 14:48.971
Might be worth
getting removed,

14:49.054 --> 14:50.472
but I'm sure it's nothing.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.933
Thank you for your professional
opinion, Dr. Gilani.

14:55.185 --> 14:57.438
Ah, craziest thing.

14:57.521 --> 14:59.648
I just happened to notice
just this second

14:59.732 --> 15:01.442
that you have a tattoo
of a duck.

15:01.525 --> 15:03.152
Yes, I do.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.321
Not many people know
about that.

15:05.404 --> 15:09.950
May I ask why you chose
that particular tattoo?

15:10.034 --> 15:12.494
It's a fairly interesting
story, actually.

15:12.578 --> 15:13.704
Would you like to hear it?

15:13.787 --> 15:16.874
Uh, sure, I guess.

15:16.957 --> 15:20.711
It all started back
in Athens, 2004.

15:20.794 --> 15:23.213
I'd just blown out my knee
in the women's heptathlon.

15:23.297 --> 15:25.841
My Olympic career was over,
and I was devastated.

15:25.924 --> 15:29.011
Until I was discovered
by the IMG modeling agency

15:29.094 --> 15:31.055
on the streets of Milan.

15:32.056 --> 15:34.058
I wouldn't say
I detonated the bomb,

15:34.141 --> 15:36.518
but I would say
I played a crucial role

15:36.602 --> 15:39.188
in why the bomb was detonated.

15:40.564 --> 15:43.108
But then Oprah ultimately
chose Gayle!

15:45.944 --> 15:48.530
So I slapped the sultan
and dove off the yacht,

15:48.614 --> 15:52.660
and realized in that moment
I wanted to become a doctor.

15:52.743 --> 15:57.164
The name of the yacht:
<i>Water Off a Duck's Back.</i>

15:59.124 --> 16:02.670
And that's why I have
a tattoo of a duck.

16:02.753 --> 16:05.756
That is the most
incredible story

16:05.839 --> 16:07.841
I've ever heard in my life.

16:07.925 --> 16:09.718
Yeah.
(chuckles)

16:09.802 --> 16:12.221
It's too bad you can't
tell anyone about it.

16:12.304 --> 16:13.222
Why not?

16:13.305 --> 16:15.683
Because our conversation stemmed

16:15.766 --> 16:18.102
from a medical examination.

16:18.185 --> 16:20.437
That means everything
I just told you

16:20.521 --> 16:23.774
falls under doctor/patient
confidentiality.

16:23.857 --> 16:27.277
Now, if you'll excuse me,
Dr. Gilani.

16:32.116 --> 16:33.742
But it's so good!

16:33.826 --> 16:36.745
How much do I even really like
being a doctor?

16:38.622 --> 16:40.374
Dennis, do my hands feel cold?

16:40.457 --> 16:43.377
Oh, only for an alive person.

16:43.460 --> 16:44.586
(chuckles)

16:44.670 --> 16:46.088
But look who's here.

16:46.171 --> 16:48.549
I should probably
contact the EPA

16:48.632 --> 16:52.386
and issue a<i> smug alert.</i>
(laughs)

16:52.469 --> 16:55.597
Actually, Dennis,
I'm not mad at him anymore.

16:55.681 --> 16:58.600
Well, when were you
gonna let me know?

16:58.684 --> 17:01.520
I spent my whole lunch break
working on stuff, Carol.

17:03.063 --> 17:05.941
I have a lot of
good rejoinders.

17:03.063 --> 17:05.941
Okay.

17:06.024 --> 17:08.318
Look, I'm sure you'll get mad
at someone else soon.

17:08.402 --> 17:10.738
(chuckling): Yeah,
that's probably true.

17:12.990 --> 17:15.784
Hey. What's going on?

17:15.868 --> 17:17.953
You're sort of smiling.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.621
Should I run a stroke protocol?

17:19.705 --> 17:22.124
(chuckles)

17:22.207 --> 17:24.960
I'm almost smiling because
I just got some good news.

17:25.043 --> 17:26.962
Eddie's liver is on its way.

17:27.045 --> 17:28.756
Oh, my God, that's amazing.

17:28.839 --> 17:30.799
Oh, he must have been so
excited; what did he say?

17:30.883 --> 17:33.802
Actually, I haven't
told him yet.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.929
I thought maybe you'd like
to give him the good news.

17:38.223 --> 17:40.934
Dr. Lewis,
thank you so much.

17:41.018 --> 17:43.437
Well, I figured you probably
had a liver piñata

17:43.520 --> 17:44.772
hidden in your locker.

17:48.192 --> 17:49.902
That's presumptuous.

17:49.985 --> 17:52.488
It's in the trunk of my car.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.114
I knew it.

17:57.242 --> 18:00.287
So...
(clears throat)

18:00.370 --> 18:03.707
...what was the blowhard
going on about this time?

18:05.042 --> 18:07.503
He wins one<i> New Yorker</i>
cartoon caption contest

18:07.586 --> 18:10.172
and you'd think he'd stormed
the beach at Normandy. Heh.

18:10.255 --> 18:13.467
You know what, Dr. Frost?

18:13.550 --> 18:15.677
Maybe he's not so bad
after all.

18:15.761 --> 18:18.639
Ah.

18:18.722 --> 18:22.309
Another one seduced
by his siren song.

18:24.561 --> 18:29.149
Stuck between Scylla
and Charybdis, am I right?

18:29.233 --> 18:32.653
No one knows what
you're talking about.

18:35.072 --> 18:37.199
Well, why would somebody
get a tattoo of a duck?

18:37.282 --> 18:39.409
I mean, they can both
swim and fly.

18:39.493 --> 18:41.328
We know, Carol,
it means nothing.

18:39.493 --> 18:41.328
Okay.

18:41.411 --> 18:45.040
I would literally write
a check for $10,000 to know.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.667
I can't do this anymore.

18:46.750 --> 18:49.044
Guys, I--

18:49.127 --> 18:51.421
I want to know, too.

18:51.505 --> 18:54.007
You're the last person
she'd tell.

18:54.091 --> 18:55.884
You know, because
of your big mouth.

18:58.303 --> 19:00.222
Hey.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.559
Did you guys see that?

19:01.640 --> 19:03.559
(laughs)

19:03.642 --> 19:05.060
See what?

19:05.144 --> 19:06.854
I believe the sophisticated
way to put it is,

19:06.937 --> 19:09.064
♪ Carol likes a boy-oy ♪

19:09.147 --> 19:12.067
♪ Carol's in lo-ove ♪

19:12.150 --> 19:14.695
♪ You, like, totally want
to have all his babies. ♪

19:14.778 --> 19:17.906
Except it's probably
too late for that.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.576
Okay, you guys are ridiculous.

19:20.659 --> 19:22.327
I don't--

19:23.328 --> 19:24.538
Oh, my God, I like a boy.

19:24.621 --> 19:26.415
Oh...

19:24.621 --> 19:26.415
(laughter)

19:32.296 --> 19:37.050
Mmm, my liver is delicious.

19:37.134 --> 19:38.427
Well, enjoy it.
It's the last thing

19:38.510 --> 19:40.053
you can eat before surgery.

19:40.137 --> 19:42.097
Eddie, would you rather have
two noses

19:42.180 --> 19:43.265
or a third arm on your back?

19:43.348 --> 19:44.641
Is it a baby arm?

19:46.810 --> 19:48.604
Why does everyone think
it's a baby arm?

19:48.687 --> 19:51.064
Okay, how about this?

19:51.148 --> 19:52.774
Would you rather meet an alien

19:52.858 --> 19:54.776
or know the taste
of human flesh?

19:54.860 --> 19:56.403
Okay, this game is over.

19:56.486 --> 19:57.571
Thank you, it's over.

19:56.486 --> 19:57.571
Oh!
