If it isn't the old
Pool and Spa Depot girl.

00:06.967 --> 00:08.233
And I do mean old.

00:08.333 --> 00:10.000
Are you gonna let our daughter
run off...

00:10.100 --> 00:11.267
with those rocker-looking dudes?

00:11.367 --> 00:12.833
You see a couple of kids
go by here?

00:12.933 --> 00:15.367
They were headed out
to Party Cove.

00:16.633 --> 00:17.867
Oh, my god, we won!

00:17.967 --> 00:20.500
All right.
Let's keep it moving, okay?

00:20.600 --> 00:22.633
Is it rum, vodka?

00:22.733 --> 00:23.833
Oh, my god, are you drunk?

00:23.933 --> 00:26.000
Gimme that!
Vernon!

00:26.100 --> 00:28.233
Whoa!
Whoa!

00:28.333 --> 00:30.733
[VERNON]
Hey, did we... you know...

00:40.567 --> 00:43.567
( ROCK MUSIC PLAYING )

01:02.200 --> 01:05.667
Drop that axe!

01:05.767 --> 01:08.700
( THEME MUSIC PLAYING )

01:11.867 --> 01:14.733
Ah, wait a minute, hah... uh--

01:14.833 --> 01:17.167
Burnin' Vernon?

01:17.267 --> 01:21.100
I used to roadie for you back
in the day! Crazy Dave.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.400
You know, on account
that my name's Dave?

01:23.500 --> 01:25.833
Right. Yeah, yeah,
I remember you.

01:25.933 --> 01:28.500
Well, you see, I work
for Trayne now...

01:28.600 --> 01:30.833
and that's his guitar that
you're stealing.

01:30.933 --> 01:33.533
Oh, oh, no, you don't
understand.

01:33.633 --> 01:35.533
See I knew Trayne was playing
here...

01:35.633 --> 01:37.867
and what I thought I'd do
is prank him...

01:37.967 --> 01:39.533
with the old "steal-the-guitar"
prank.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.967
Remember that, like I used
to do back in the day...

01:42.067 --> 01:43.933
when he opened for me on tour?

01:44.067 --> 01:46.200
Oh, yeah, the "steal-the-guitar"
prank.

01:46.300 --> 01:49.800
Hey, what the hell, you should
come to the show tomorrow night.

01:49.900 --> 01:51.933
Oh, man, I'd love to, man...

01:52.067 --> 01:53.533
but I gotta check
my calendar, man.

01:53.633 --> 01:58.067
I got like, a lot-- lotta busy
stuff on my plate, man slamming.

01:58.100 --> 02:01.067
but the fact of the matter is,
if by chance...

02:01.167 --> 02:03.300
there would be an opening,
I'll need me plus two.

02:03.400 --> 02:06.067
Oh, no problem, I'll see you
tomorrow night!

02:06.167 --> 02:08.367
All right, man,
I'll see you around.

02:08.467 --> 02:10.367
Hey, Vern!

02:10.467 --> 02:13.333
I am gonna need the guitar.

02:13.433 --> 02:15.433
Hah! Gotcha again, didn't I?

02:15.533 --> 02:17.767
Yes, you did.

02:17.867 --> 02:19.767
You are a joker.

02:21.067 --> 02:23.500
What?
Oh, nothing...

02:23.600 --> 02:25.400
Uh, just this guy at school
said he beat your record...

02:25.500 --> 02:27.367
for chugging a bottle of syrup.

02:27.467 --> 02:29.400
Was it that jackhole
Andy Epstein?

02:29.500 --> 02:32.500
Ronnie, no. If you do, you'll be
bouncing off the walls again.

02:32.600 --> 02:36.167
Get my special occasion insulin.
I'm going in... time me.

02:36.267 --> 02:37.900
Morning family!

02:38.067 --> 02:39.067
Go.

02:39.100 --> 02:41.633
Something smells good.

02:41.733 --> 02:46.600
Hey Deb, you ain't by chance
been missing something...

02:46.700 --> 02:49.133
you left down at the lake
last weekend, have you?

02:49.233 --> 02:51.900
The lake, of course, not.

02:52.067 --> 02:53.433
I haven't even thought
about the lake.

02:57.867 --> 03:00.900
Well, if you ever want to return
to the blue lagoon...

03:01.067 --> 03:04.667
I'd be more than happy
to oblige.

03:04.767 --> 03:05.867
Done!

03:05.967 --> 03:08.733
Aw, shoot, looks like a tie.
What?

03:08.833 --> 03:13.067
I love that lake. I'd like
to be on it all the time.

03:13.167 --> 03:15.600
Dude, what are you
talking about?

03:15.700 --> 03:18.133
Out on the lake?
You don't even own a boat.

03:18.233 --> 03:20.233
Let alone know how
to service one.

03:20.333 --> 03:22.400
Well, I'm sure if I found
a model I liked enough...

03:22.500 --> 03:25.100
I could service it
as often as it needed.

03:25.200 --> 03:27.133
Can we just stop
with the boat talk?

03:27.233 --> 03:29.600
Well, come on, honey.
I've got a big surprise for you!

03:29.700 --> 03:30.633
We need to get going.

03:30.733 --> 03:32.400
Hope it's better
than your last one.

03:32.500 --> 03:34.467
And you still owe Dallas
a new guitar.

03:34.567 --> 03:36.433
I'm sorry, but I had to do
what I had to do.

03:36.533 --> 03:38.367
The guy was close-singing
and uh--

03:38.467 --> 03:39.833
Anyway I'm gonna make
it up to you.

03:39.933 --> 03:41.067
Come on, it's gonna be great.

03:41.167 --> 03:43.233
See you later, Deb.
Bye.

03:43.333 --> 03:45.867
Ronald.
Sir.

03:47.267 --> 03:49.467
The sugar's settling in.

03:51.233 --> 03:54.933
Ronnie, I'm gonna take you
to dinner tonight.

03:55.067 --> 03:56.433
Awesome. We gonna go to--

03:56.533 --> 03:59.200
No, baby, we're not going
to Tepid's.

03:59.300 --> 04:01.333
But... that's my favorite.

04:01.433 --> 04:04.100
Don't you mean your second
favorite?

04:04.200 --> 04:05.667
Santa Fe Cattle Company?

04:05.767 --> 04:07.367
Santa Fe Cattle Company.

04:07.467 --> 04:11.067
Uh-oh... sugar's coming back
with a vengeance.

04:11.133 --> 04:13.900
Hitting me kind of hard.
Can't see--

04:14.067 --> 04:15.700
Coming back.

04:15.800 --> 04:20.233
Help! Help! Who's there?

04:21.633 --> 04:24.200
Oh, all right, all right,
see that?

04:24.300 --> 04:26.233
It's like she knew exactly
when to come over.

04:26.333 --> 04:28.967
Attentive servers are a sign
of the high life, Ronnie.

04:29.067 --> 04:30.133
Yeah, we made it.

04:30.233 --> 04:31.533
And I ordered your favorite
dessert.

04:31.633 --> 04:33.100
Big-ass chocolate cake?
Uh-huh.

04:33.200 --> 04:34.400
Are you serious?

04:34.500 --> 04:35.900
Wait, why are you being
so nice to me?

04:36.067 --> 04:38.967
Would you mind bringing my
beautiful man here another beer?

04:39.067 --> 04:40.267
He deserves it.

04:40.367 --> 04:43.167
Am I dying?
Of course, not.

04:43.267 --> 04:45.533
Pool and Spa Depot,
we have a huge--

04:45.633 --> 04:48.267
Another Pool and Spa Depot
commercial.

04:48.367 --> 04:50.233
For all your spa-ing needs.

04:50.333 --> 04:53.067
And here comes stupid Pamela,
in her stupid bikini.

04:53.100 --> 04:54.400
Yee-haw!

04:54.500 --> 04:56.533
Wait, she wasn't in the
commercial.

04:56.633 --> 04:59.733
Ronnie, did you see that?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no Pamela.

04:59.833 --> 05:02.167
Ronnie, you wanna do one
of your all-time...

05:02.267 --> 05:03.200
favorite activities?

05:03.300 --> 05:04.367
You talking about ninja kicks?

05:04.467 --> 05:06.333
No.
Doin' it in the yard?

05:06.433 --> 05:09.267
Mm-mm... better.
Fake hot tub shopping.

05:09.367 --> 05:12.367
Man, this is the best day ever!
Wait, why you doi--

05:14.400 --> 05:17.267
Did you cheat on me?

05:17.367 --> 05:19.600
Ha-ha, your freakin' face,
you're killing me.

05:19.700 --> 05:22.800
I'm just bustin' your balls.
Let's go tubbin'!

05:22.900 --> 05:24.400
Oh, you are gonna love this!

05:24.500 --> 05:26.933
Trayne Crostown puts on a
helluva show.

05:27.067 --> 05:28.500
Oh, he's been known to sing...

05:28.600 --> 05:31.100
into the mouth
of a crocodile on stage.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.633
It's the perfect father-daughter
activity.

05:33.733 --> 05:35.067
Why is he here?

05:35.100 --> 05:37.467
Man, I remember going on tour
with my dad when I was a kid.

05:37.567 --> 05:38.933
We used to come down here.

05:39.067 --> 05:41.967
Pretty big country music fan.

05:42.067 --> 05:43.800
I dunno, it's not
really my thing.

05:43.900 --> 05:45.667
You've never been to a
country music concert...

05:45.767 --> 05:49.567
with the Burnin' Vernon.
I mean, we're VIPs here.

05:49.667 --> 05:52.633
[CROWD] Suck it! Suck it!
These are my people!

05:52.733 --> 05:54.067
Suck it! Yeah!

05:54.133 --> 05:55.633
Your people are a real
class act.

05:55.733 --> 05:57.167
Yeah, well, you ain't gonna
be so high and mighty...

05:57.267 --> 05:58.800
when we get inside.

05:58.900 --> 06:02.067
Our seats are right in the
middle of the action, come on!

06:05.200 --> 06:07.067
These seats aren't so bad.

06:07.167 --> 06:10.567
It kinda makes ya reflect on how
small we are in this universe.

06:10.667 --> 06:12.667
See, you may think we have
bad seats...

06:12.767 --> 06:15.533
but actually we got
a great view.

06:18.700 --> 06:21.100
This is BS, we're going
for an upgrade.

06:24.367 --> 06:25.733
Listen, those seats were
just fine.

06:25.833 --> 06:27.233
I don't want to cause any
trouble or anything.

06:27.333 --> 06:28.833
Oh, no, don't be silly...

06:28.933 --> 06:31.333
I'm sure they just gave us the
wrong tickets, that's all.

06:31.433 --> 06:33.300
How you doing, sir?
It's nice to see you.

06:33.400 --> 06:34.500
I'm here to see Trayne.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.233
Everybody here to see Trayne.

06:36.333 --> 06:39.067
Ha, that's a good one. No, I'm
actually a special guest.

06:39.100 --> 06:42.233
I gave the boy his break,
name's Vernon Brown.

06:42.333 --> 06:43.867
You're not on the list.

06:45.967 --> 06:49.333
Hey, wait a minute, you didn't
check the list for those two.

06:49.433 --> 06:52.367
Hot chicks.

06:52.467 --> 06:53.567
All right, just follow my lead.

06:53.667 --> 06:55.900
If anything goes wrong,
we scatter, okay?

06:56.067 --> 06:58.767
All right, come on, look
important, you ready?

06:58.867 --> 07:00.200
Let's roll.

07:00.300 --> 07:01.700
Clyde, get the investors
on the line!

07:01.800 --> 07:03.300
These investors aren't
investing!

07:03.400 --> 07:06.767
I don't see it in my... papers.
Someone get me more papers!

07:06.867 --> 07:10.400
I can't talk right now,
I'm a very important person.

07:10.500 --> 07:11.933
I can't believe it worked!

07:12.067 --> 07:14.367
See, what'd I tell ya?
Ya just look like you belong...

07:14.467 --> 07:17.267
and the next thing you know,
you're in, it's the way life is.

07:17.367 --> 07:18.733
Now-- save yourselves!

07:18.833 --> 07:21.067
Come on, let's go, let's go,
come on.

07:21.167 --> 07:23.800
Guys, easy, man, easy,
I got an image to protect here.

07:23.900 --> 07:27.200
Come on, you're ruffling the--
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

07:27.300 --> 07:30.867
Burnin' Vernon Brown!
Man, I thought you was dead!

07:30.967 --> 07:34.100
Lil' Trayne! Man, oh, man,
I ain't seen you...

07:34.200 --> 07:36.100
since you opened that show
for me in Houston.

07:36.200 --> 07:38.200
That's right, I opened for you,
now you're trying to sneak in...

07:38.300 --> 07:42.300
to my sold-out, massive arena
show. Man, that's rich! Like me.

07:42.400 --> 07:44.267
Let him go, fellas,
he's harmless.

07:44.367 --> 07:46.167
Let's go get our pre-party on!

07:46.267 --> 07:48.933
Hey, all right, man, it looks
like you're doing pretty good.

07:49.067 --> 07:50.267
Not too bad, baby.

07:50.367 --> 07:53.533
I think we could do it!
I'm in!

07:54.367 --> 07:58.467
Well, this is... pretty sweet.

07:58.567 --> 08:02.567
Yeah. So, it's just me
and you now, huh?

08:02.667 --> 08:04.500
15... you're probably
just starting...

08:04.600 --> 08:06.100
to make your own electricity.

08:06.200 --> 08:09.500
Hey, Crazy Dave! It's uh--
I'm Robert Murray's boy.

08:09.600 --> 08:10.900
It's been forever, man.

08:11.067 --> 08:13.967
Wait, you're Lil' Walt Murray?

08:14.067 --> 08:14.967
Yup.

08:15.067 --> 08:16.900
God, you were a weird,
little kid.

08:17.067 --> 08:21.300
You used to talk about bigfoot
and aliens and all that crap.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.600
So what are you doing now?

08:23.700 --> 08:25.400
This and that.

08:25.500 --> 08:27.200
ASSISTANT (OVER RADIO) Got the
chum, feeding the shark!

08:27.300 --> 08:28.567
10-4 on the shark.

08:28.667 --> 08:30.400
Did you say shark? Here?

08:30.500 --> 08:34.667
Yeah, well, Trayne's got this
ritual that he does every night.

08:34.767 --> 08:38.733
He's gotta face death in the
face with a real shark.

08:38.833 --> 08:41.200
It's the only way he can keep
his high going...

08:41.300 --> 08:43.167
once he gets off the stage.

08:43.267 --> 08:44.900
Listen, I've gotta go.

08:45.067 --> 08:47.133
Oh, you need to have
one of these.

08:48.400 --> 08:49.367
What is this?

08:49.467 --> 08:50.967
Oh, it's Backstage Backwash.

08:51.067 --> 08:53.133
It's Trayne's signature
cocktail.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.867
I was sober six years when
I started working here.

08:55.967 --> 09:00.400
But when the boss says jump,
I'm jumping, let's go!

09:02.967 --> 09:05.267
I gotta see that shark.
I gotta see that shark.

09:05.367 --> 09:07.467
I wouldn't be caught dead
in one of these things.

09:07.567 --> 09:09.533
Are you gonna buy a hot tub,
or what?

09:09.633 --> 09:13.067
Maybe... maybe not.

09:13.133 --> 09:17.833
But if you work on commission,
I'd tread lightly, brother.

09:17.933 --> 09:19.133
Okay.

09:19.233 --> 09:21.300
Hey, where you going
with that skanky cut-out...

09:21.400 --> 09:22.700
of the Pool and Spa Depot Girl?

09:22.800 --> 09:25.633
To the trash, where she belongs!

09:27.067 --> 09:29.233
What are you doing here? You
never leave the flagship store.

09:29.333 --> 09:32.867
I wanted to personally oversee
the purging of Pamela's...

09:32.967 --> 09:35.300
cheating whore face
from my stores.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.233
Shut... up. She cheated on you?

09:37.333 --> 09:38.900
Yeah.

09:39.067 --> 09:41.967
What kind of horrible, rotten
person would do that to you?

09:42.067 --> 09:43.567
You did.

09:43.667 --> 09:47.500
Trace-kins... baby,
this isn't about me.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.167
Aw, come here.

09:49.267 --> 09:53.933
You just here tell me every
horrible, despicable detail.

09:54.067 --> 09:57.733
Okay, well, let's see, she was
all dressed up, you know?

10:06.033 --> 10:08.800
What do you think of that
soothing background music?

10:08.900 --> 10:13.333
It's all right... kinda reminds
me of elevator music.

10:13.433 --> 10:14.467
Switch!

10:14.567 --> 10:16.733
Hey, you want some sushi?
Huh?

10:16.833 --> 10:19.767
T.K. here, he'll make you
anything you want.

10:19.867 --> 10:21.567
Everything he prepares
is endangered.

10:21.667 --> 10:23.500
We got the golden chopsticks.

10:23.600 --> 10:25.367
I'm not very good with
chopsticks...

10:25.467 --> 10:28.567
but I would take you up on some
of that Backstage Backwash...

10:28.667 --> 10:30.867
if you got any!
Backwash!

10:30.967 --> 10:33.600
It's made with top shelf rum
and reclaimed Fanta...

10:33.700 --> 10:36.700
we get snuck in from Colombia.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.667
Woo! That even tastes illegal.

10:38.767 --> 10:40.200
I know, I know.

10:40.300 --> 10:43.200
Man, I just--

10:43.300 --> 10:46.733
I don't know what I'd do
if I lost all this stuff.

10:46.833 --> 10:50.667
Speaking of, what you
got going on?

10:50.767 --> 10:53.333
Oh, I'm doing the
Incognito Tour...

10:53.433 --> 10:55.467
kinda keepin' it low key.

10:55.567 --> 10:57.967
Man, you seem kind of tense.

10:58.067 --> 11:01.800
Now, you want that Balinese
to walk on your back...

11:01.900 --> 11:05.233
with those tiny, little,
baby feet?

11:05.333 --> 11:07.733
Just say the word,
she's real little--

11:07.833 --> 11:09.967
Hey, Yon! Hey, man!

11:10.067 --> 11:13.833
Hey, Vernon, do you know Yon,
Yon Aswad?

11:13.933 --> 11:16.833
He's the head cheese
for Rock Records Magazine.

11:16.933 --> 11:19.467
He's doing a little piece on me.
I don't want the attention.

11:19.567 --> 11:21.333
I hate it, but Yon insists.

11:21.433 --> 11:22.900
We've met.

11:23.067 --> 11:25.367
Vernon, you got the number one
record in the country right now.

11:25.467 --> 11:27.333
How does it feel?

11:29.400 --> 11:31.733
My bad.

11:31.833 --> 11:33.333
I think I gotta piss.

11:38.667 --> 11:40.767
What's up?

11:45.767 --> 11:47.700
My bad.

11:47.800 --> 11:51.200
Joanna, will you marry me?

11:55.800 --> 11:57.233
My bad.

11:57.333 --> 12:00.433
Oh, I'm sorry, man, my memory
is just about gone!

12:00.533 --> 12:02.300
Hey, you know, my daughter,
she's been doing...

12:02.400 --> 12:04.367
a lot of writing about music
and musicians.

12:04.467 --> 12:06.633
Maybe she could take a meeting
with you...

12:06.733 --> 12:08.700
and you could give her
some career advice?

12:08.800 --> 12:10.667
I'd love to meet your daughter.

12:10.767 --> 12:12.600
Hey, man, 100 watts.

12:12.700 --> 12:17.400
I told you guys, 60-watt soft,
all right? Come on, get it.

12:18.467 --> 12:19.700
Damn, man.

12:19.800 --> 12:22.867
That shark has got to be
around here somewhere.

12:22.967 --> 12:25.900
How many places can you hide
a shark, anyway?

12:26.067 --> 12:27.100
Depends on the size
of the shark...

12:27.200 --> 12:29.533
and if it's a male or a female.

12:29.633 --> 12:30.900
Oh, this has got to be it.

12:31.067 --> 12:33.100
Wait, this is it?

12:33.200 --> 12:35.767
That's a really tiny shark.

12:35.867 --> 12:38.867
Well, you know, sometimes
when things are tiny...

12:38.967 --> 12:41.833
they're more fierce
in the animal kingdom.

12:41.933 --> 12:44.300
Walt!
It was an accident!

12:44.400 --> 12:47.233
Maybe no one will notice.

12:47.333 --> 12:50.767
Oh, that's not good.

12:50.867 --> 12:55.800
Okay, um, let's just sneak out
of here...

12:55.900 --> 12:57.800
and then nobody has to know.

12:57.900 --> 12:59.700
Everybody knows.

12:59.800 --> 13:01.400
If they find out the tiny shark
is dead...

13:01.500 --> 13:04.533
they can just go back to the
tapes and trace it back to us!

13:04.633 --> 13:06.067
Well, what're we supposed to do?

13:06.133 --> 13:08.233
We need a decoy shark.

13:08.333 --> 13:11.400
I know a guy. Come on,
let's get out of here.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.367
I mean, one minute, we're at the
County Fair...

13:13.467 --> 13:17.867
and she's right there and we're
all lady-and-the-tramp'ing...

13:17.967 --> 13:22.100
a fried twinkie, and then the
next minute.

13:23.800 --> 13:26.333
'Scuse me, amigo.
Yeah, whatever.

13:30.733 --> 13:35.700
Pam-cakes? What are y'all
doing in there?

13:35.800 --> 13:37.400
Peeing.

13:39.867 --> 13:41.367
Peeing?

13:41.467 --> 13:43.833
You know, Trace, it's times
like these...

13:43.933 --> 13:46.233
when you gotta look
at the big picture...

13:46.333 --> 13:48.867
and ask yourself some pretty
tough questions.

13:48.967 --> 13:51.800
Like what's gonna happen to the
Pool and Spa Depot girl?

13:51.900 --> 13:54.067
I can't think about that
right now.

13:54.100 --> 13:57.967
The Pool and Spa Depot girl is--
she's a regional institution.

13:58.067 --> 14:01.200
I don't know, I got no proof she
was boosting sales, anyway.

14:05.067 --> 14:07.833
Let me show you what a real
Pool and Spa Depot girl...

14:07.933 --> 14:09.967
can do to boost your sales.

14:21.767 --> 14:23.933
Got your booty call, Walt.

14:24.067 --> 14:26.100
It wasn't a booty call, Coy.
You're weirdin' me out.

14:26.200 --> 14:29.833
Well, every phone call is a
potential booty call...

14:29.933 --> 14:31.267
if you play your cards right.

14:31.367 --> 14:33.333
I'm looking for a fish, okay?

14:33.433 --> 14:35.433
Yeah, well, you've come
to the right spot.

14:35.533 --> 14:37.300
Your fish is my command.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.367
Look-- but it's a very
specific kind of fish...

14:39.467 --> 14:42.067
and you have to handle this with
complete discretion, okay?

14:42.133 --> 14:43.633
I'm in a slippery situation
here.

14:43.733 --> 14:50.433
Ah, lucky for you, handling
slippery situations...

14:50.533 --> 14:53.367
is Coy's forte.

14:53.467 --> 14:55.700
Okay, I'm looking for a baby
shark, like a tiny shark...

14:55.800 --> 14:57.267
about this big.

14:57.367 --> 15:01.267
Do you have any idea what you're
asking me for, my friend?

15:01.367 --> 15:05.700
I mean, no, not really. I don't
know a lot about tiny sharks.

15:05.800 --> 15:08.300
Don't move.

15:16.633 --> 15:20.733
Myanmar hand shark... eh--

15:20.833 --> 15:23.167
As rare as it is tiny...

15:23.267 --> 15:30.100
as tiny as it is deadly,
as deadly as it is... rare.

15:31.300 --> 15:33.100
Okay, I got it.
How much do I owe you?

15:33.200 --> 15:38.800
This one's on me...
but the next one's on you.

15:38.900 --> 15:40.267
Okay, I'm gonna give you $20...

15:40.367 --> 15:43.067
and then this transaction
is over forever, okay?

15:52.600 --> 15:55.800
Okay, I've gotta say,
this is pretty cool.

15:55.900 --> 15:58.933
Whoa, Yon! This is my daughter
I was telling you about.

15:59.067 --> 16:00.333
She's the one that's a writer.

16:00.433 --> 16:02.733
This is Yon, he works for
Rock Records.

16:02.833 --> 16:05.133
He might be able to give you
a little career advice.

16:05.233 --> 16:07.133
Awesome. Nice to meet you.

16:07.233 --> 16:08.700
Oh, the pleasure is all mine.

16:08.800 --> 16:11.067
[TRAYNE] Thanks, everybody,
thank you very much.

16:11.100 --> 16:14.733
Earlier today, when I was riding
around on my fancy golf cart...

16:14.833 --> 16:17.233
I saw an old buddy of mine
trying to sneak in the show.

16:17.333 --> 16:20.333
Oh, just kidding.
Trayne is asking for you.

16:20.433 --> 16:22.433
Uh, Trayne's onstage.
Let's bring him out...

16:22.533 --> 16:24.333
and see if he's still
has the golden pipes.

16:24.433 --> 16:29.300
Put your hands together for my
old buddy, Burnin' Vernon!

16:30.967 --> 16:32.567
Go!

16:32.667 --> 16:34.833
Are you serious?
Go on!

16:36.833 --> 16:39.367
And the best thing about the
"Slow and Low 2"...

16:39.467 --> 16:41.433
is it's lounge-style seating...

16:41.533 --> 16:44.067
so you can just lay down
and relax...

16:44.133 --> 16:46.267
without worrying about
slipping off that bench--

16:46.367 --> 16:48.333
Babe, you got my spares?

16:48.433 --> 16:52.133
Did I tell y'all about the
antibacterial coating?

16:52.233 --> 16:54.733
Now, if you're looking for the
ultimate relaxation...

16:54.833 --> 16:56.767
spa experience, well,
you just can't beat...

16:56.867 --> 16:59.233
the cascade waterfall feature
in our VIP collection.

16:59.333 --> 17:01.533
So if you just want
to follow me.

17:03.267 --> 17:08.267
* Then I was in Hollywood
wishing I was doin' good *

17:08.367 --> 17:12.133
* Talking on the telephone
line *

17:12.233 --> 17:14.900
* They don't need me
in the movies *

17:15.067 --> 17:16.833
* Ain't nobody sings my songs

17:16.933 --> 17:18.967
She just couldn't erase the
memory of her engagement ring...

17:19.067 --> 17:20.933
floating in a puddle
of pretzel barf...

17:21.067 --> 17:23.667
so I had to buy her a new one.

17:23.767 --> 17:26.533
Now my therapist says I have
Emetophobia.

17:26.633 --> 17:29.200
Know what that is?

17:29.300 --> 17:31.700
Uh, fear of vomiting.

17:34.067 --> 17:37.700
Vernon Brown really is the worst
person in the music business.

17:37.800 --> 17:40.333
You know what, thank you so much
for the great career advice.

17:40.433 --> 17:41.900
I'd really love to hear more...

17:42.067 --> 17:44.567
but I'm kind of feeling
a little, uh--

17:44.667 --> 17:46.067
No... no.

17:46.100 --> 17:47.467
Queasy.

17:52.433 --> 17:54.167
Hey, hey, check it out.

17:54.267 --> 17:56.333
Replacement shark.

17:56.433 --> 17:58.067
Did you even look at it?

17:58.167 --> 17:59.667
Sorry, it was dark
and rapey there.

17:59.767 --> 18:01.300
Whoo!

18:01.400 --> 18:03.067
ASSISTANT (OVER RADIO)
Okay, the set is complete.

18:03.167 --> 18:07.467
We got the shark room's ETA,
one minute, one minute, people.

18:09.467 --> 18:11.900
Great big hand
for Burnin' Vernon!

18:14.067 --> 18:16.433
We'll see y'all next year!
Thank you very much!

18:16.533 --> 18:18.833
Man, I can't believe
you did that.

18:18.933 --> 18:22.800
Well, I guess I'm a sucker. I
had to throw an old dog a bone!

18:22.900 --> 18:24.500
ASSISTANT (OVER RADIO)
Standby, please.

18:24.600 --> 18:27.200
We've got Trayne entering
the Shark Room.

18:27.300 --> 18:30.533
[MEDIC] This is Medic 4, we are
on standby at the perimeter.

18:30.633 --> 18:31.833
DISPATCH (OVER RADIO)
10-4, Medic 4.

18:33.200 --> 18:35.067
Silence!

18:36.367 --> 18:37.533
Shark me.

18:38.700 --> 18:40.433
Symphony.

18:40.533 --> 18:43.900
( PLAYING "JAWS" THEME )

18:44.067 --> 18:47.833
Three, two, one.

18:51.867 --> 18:55.967
Argh! Argh!

18:56.067 --> 18:59.067
Argh!

18:59.100 --> 19:00.933
Whoo-hoo!

19:01.067 --> 19:02.500
Ah, man!

19:02.600 --> 19:04.967
Sometimes-- sometimes you gotta
look death in the face...

19:05.067 --> 19:06.800
just to know you're alive!

19:06.900 --> 19:09.800
I mean, I can't-- I can't help
it, I'm an adrenaline junkie.

19:12.333 --> 19:13.533
Wait a minute--

19:13.633 --> 19:15.133
Go, let's go! Go, go, go!

19:15.233 --> 19:17.067
What the hell just happened?

19:22.100 --> 19:23.633
Thank you.

19:25.567 --> 19:28.233
Congratulations...
best decision you ever made!

19:28.333 --> 19:29.933
You're gonna love it!

19:30.067 --> 19:34.167
All right, maybe the Pool and
Spa Depot girl is important.

19:34.267 --> 19:35.433
Damn straight!

19:35.533 --> 19:36.633
And those were my first
customers...

19:36.733 --> 19:38.067
already made my first sale.

19:38.167 --> 19:40.067
Uh, your second sale.

19:41.167 --> 19:42.733
Ronnie! What the hell?

19:42.833 --> 19:44.667
You had me sold
at VIP waterfall.

19:44.767 --> 19:46.267
Call my assistant next week...

19:46.367 --> 19:47.967
we'll set up a time for you
to come in.

19:48.067 --> 19:49.500
You did good, Deb-kins.

19:49.600 --> 19:50.967
Really? That's great.
Yep, really.

19:51.067 --> 19:53.167
Good job. We'll see ya.
Yay.

19:53.267 --> 19:54.667
We're gonna need to make
a return.

19:54.767 --> 19:56.933
Ooh, I already peed in it
a little bit!

19:58.700 --> 20:01.333
That was awesome,
thanks for taking me!

20:01.433 --> 20:05.200
Now, hold on. I got one
more surprise for ya.

20:05.300 --> 20:06.867
This is for that boy
you hang out with--

20:06.967 --> 20:10.167
Oh, Austin, Houston, Tex,
whatever his name is.

20:10.267 --> 20:14.400
I told you I was gonna make it
up to you, here you go.

20:15.433 --> 20:18.500
Really? Sweet!

20:25.000 --> 20:26.467
Thanks.

20:30.100 --> 20:31.833
First hug from your daughter.

20:31.933 --> 20:34.167
Kinda does a number on ya,
doesn't it?

20:34.267 --> 20:36.300
Yeah, no kiddin'.

20:36.400 --> 20:37.767
Well, it was a nice thing
you did.

20:37.867 --> 20:39.967
Well, if you wanna keep
the niceties coming, you know...

20:40.067 --> 20:42.867
we could always go for
a little pleasure cruise.

20:42.967 --> 20:46.600
Sorry, that ship has sailed
and sunk.

20:46.700 --> 20:50.100
You're looking at the new
Pool and Spa Depot girl.

20:50.200 --> 20:53.300
Really? Well, congratulations.

20:53.400 --> 20:55.267
Turns out filthy Pamela
was slutting it...

20:55.367 --> 20:56.367
around the County Fair.

20:56.467 --> 20:57.633
In a porta potty?

20:57.733 --> 21:01.067
Really? That's crazy.
Who with?

21:01.167 --> 21:02.767
Don't know, don't care.

21:02.867 --> 21:06.900
Well, congratulations.
You deserve it.

21:07.067 --> 21:08.600
Thank you.

21:11.367 --> 21:14.633
You stole that guitar,
didn't you?

21:14.733 --> 21:18.900
Who me? I'd never take
something that wasn't mine.

21:29.667 --> 21:33.667
Aw... the ol' "steal-the-guitar"
gag again.

21:34.700 --> 21:37.333
Okay, joke's on me.

21:37.433 --> 21:40.100
Vernon?

21:40.200 --> 21:42.367
This is kind of like
that joke when you said...

21:42.467 --> 21:45.333
you were sleeping
with my sister.

21:45.433 --> 21:48.233
That was hilarious.

21:48.333 --> 21:52.400
Vernon, you crack me up,
gosh darn it!

21:52.500 --> 21:52.667
Vernon! Hah-hah!
