WEBVTT

00:02.190 --> 00:04.899
soaking wet, looks straight to camera

00:04.924 --> 00:07.141
and goes, "Um, I'd like to buy a kayak."

00:07.141 --> 00:11.043
<i>You'll be up a creek with a paddle.</i>

00:14.749 --> 00:16.282
Really, really funny.

00:16.306 --> 00:18.707
Do not change a freaking
word, you hear me?

00:18.963 --> 00:21.030
So Sebastian, when do you
want to shoot this puppy?

00:21.055 --> 00:22.665
We can be ready by "mondee."

00:22.690 --> 00:25.124
Oh, no, no, no can do, fellas.

00:25.303 --> 00:28.671
I am walking out that door
and I'm headed to Dubai

00:28.773 --> 00:30.806
for a week of sand surfing.

00:30.908 --> 00:32.107
- A week?
- Yeah.

00:32.210 --> 00:33.209
What about work?

00:33.311 --> 00:35.544
Exactly. What about it?

00:35.647 --> 00:38.881
See, gentlemen, I have seven stores

00:38.983 --> 00:41.333
that are doing what? Gangbusters.

00:41.358 --> 00:45.059
Now, I could worry
over every little detail

00:45.084 --> 00:47.923
and die behind a desk
from a bullet to the temple

00:47.948 --> 00:49.724
like my daddy did,

00:50.239 --> 00:53.541
but I prefer to delegate
like my mommy did.

00:53.566 --> 00:55.966
Little piece of advice for you, fellas.

00:56.066 --> 01:00.903
Don't let making a living
interfere with making a life.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:11.816 --> 01:14.990
Fellas. I got to go.

01:15.781 --> 01:17.381
Well, Sebastian, enjoy Dubai.

01:17.468 --> 01:19.668
Oh, it's going to be impossible not to.

01:19.770 --> 01:21.103
Now it looks like you guys

01:21.205 --> 01:22.938
could stand a little
vacation yourselves.

01:23.040 --> 01:25.541
I mean, look how tired Tim looks.

01:25.643 --> 01:29.211
Oh, uh, that's just the
shape of my face, sir.

01:29.313 --> 01:31.881
No, I mean those huge black
circles under your eyes.

01:31.906 --> 01:33.031
You look tired.

01:33.031 --> 01:35.576
It's just how I look,
sir, how my skull is.

01:35.601 --> 01:37.901
Yeah, but your eyes, they look so sad.

01:38.003 --> 01:39.236
Mm-hmm.

01:39.338 --> 01:41.271
Like you've lived 100 lives.

01:42.608 --> 01:43.974
Okay.

01:44.076 --> 01:46.243
I mean, take Sam here, for example.

01:46.345 --> 01:48.243
He doesn't look tired at all.

01:49.181 --> 01:51.415
So one week then, or...

01:51.517 --> 01:53.517
Sebastian's so cool.

01:53.619 --> 01:55.085
He's probably our coolest client.

01:55.187 --> 01:56.987
I think he's the coolest
guy I've ever met.

01:57.089 --> 01:59.843
- Did you see his jacket? Leather.
- Mm-hmm.

01:59.868 --> 02:02.330
Came in here and
completely owned our couch.

02:02.355 --> 02:04.428
- I know.
- Guy smells like a steak.

02:04.530 --> 02:06.296
- A real good steak.
- Hey, guys.

02:06.321 --> 02:07.942
- 'Sup, Lea?
- How you gonna...

02:07.967 --> 02:09.699
- What's going on?
- What's going on?

02:09.725 --> 02:10.824
- What's happening right now?
- What are you in here for?

02:10.848 --> 02:12.115
You know how I always have to stuff

02:12.140 --> 02:14.104
all of our gear into
my car for every shoot?

02:14.129 --> 02:15.784
- Yeah, it's so funny.
- Yeah.

02:15.874 --> 02:18.175
Well, I found a cheap
production van we can buy.

02:18.277 --> 02:19.576
Where?

02:19.601 --> 02:21.535
At the police auction
for impounded vehicles.

02:21.714 --> 02:23.714
- Was this involved in a crime?
- Yes.

02:27.319 --> 02:29.119
Tim and Sam! I got a bunch

02:29.144 --> 02:30.864
of new commercial
ideas for you guys, man.

02:30.889 --> 02:32.155
Sorry, Ned. Can't talk right now.

02:32.180 --> 02:33.857
For real? Hey, they gon' 100%

02:33.882 --> 02:35.125
suck your [Bleep] with
these new ones, man,

02:35.150 --> 02:36.480
I'm telling you. Listen to this.

02:36.505 --> 02:37.705
Ready for this?

02:37.730 --> 02:40.864
Now for white people.

02:42.334 --> 02:43.711
Great stuff, Ned. Tell you what.

02:43.736 --> 02:44.979
You make an appointment sometime,

02:45.004 --> 02:46.084
we'll hear all your pitches.

02:46.109 --> 02:47.324
Hey, thank you, man. I'ma
hold you to that, man.

02:47.349 --> 02:49.082
I appreciate it! Mm!

03:14.333 --> 03:15.532
What do you think?

03:18.704 --> 03:20.070
- Slams okay.
- Mm-hmm.

03:20.172 --> 03:21.948
- Want to give it a test drive?
- Yeah.

03:34.953 --> 03:35.929
Seats are comfy.

03:35.954 --> 03:37.087
It's nice.

03:37.112 --> 03:38.132
You guys done jerking each other off?

03:38.157 --> 03:39.890
You see jizz everywhere, Lea?

03:39.992 --> 03:41.425
Yeah, Lea, if we were
jerking each other off,

03:41.527 --> 03:43.259
there'd be jizz everywhere.

03:43.729 --> 03:44.928
I'll put in our bid.

03:50.135 --> 03:51.364
This is great.

03:51.389 --> 03:52.721
We can get twice as much
work done with this van.

03:52.971 --> 03:54.515
Absolutely. We can work twice as hard.

03:54.540 --> 03:55.972
Work ourselves into the ground

03:55.997 --> 03:57.351
until we blow our brains
out like Sebastian's dad.

03:57.376 --> 03:58.819
Or go insane like my dad.

03:58.844 --> 03:59.976
Mm-hmm. Well,

04:00.001 --> 04:01.188
let's go get this work van for work.

04:01.213 --> 04:02.279
Let's do it.

04:37.278 --> 04:38.482
Assholes.

04:51.427 --> 04:53.324
I got to get back on that road, man.

04:53.349 --> 04:55.771
Oh, wow, I'm gonna go nuts in here.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.629
Oh, tell me about it.

04:57.654 --> 04:58.973
Is that stuff working?

04:58.998 --> 05:00.664
I don't know.

05:00.689 --> 05:03.056
The guy at the store
said it's makeup for plays

05:03.159 --> 05:05.844
that have a dumpy uncle character.

05:06.362 --> 05:10.030
Hey, pecker, eyes off the
hog! Pecker's taking a selfie.

05:10.132 --> 05:11.308
I'll tell you this, man.

05:11.333 --> 05:12.966
I don't get back out on that hog,

05:13.068 --> 05:15.269
I'm about four or five
seconds from wilin'.

05:15.371 --> 05:16.904
I'm about two, three
seconds from wilin'.

05:17.006 --> 05:18.472
I'm like, one second from wilin'.

05:18.497 --> 05:21.231
Gentlemen. Ned is here.

05:21.410 --> 05:22.743
The security guard?

05:22.845 --> 05:25.283
He said you told him to
set up an appointment.

05:25.308 --> 05:26.441
Sheila!

05:26.466 --> 05:28.749
You weren't actually
supposed to set that up.

05:28.851 --> 05:33.153
Oh, I guess I had a dumb blonde moment.

05:34.290 --> 05:35.956
She thinks she's blonde?

05:36.135 --> 05:37.845
I hope y'all ready for this shit, man.

05:37.870 --> 05:40.971
This shit is coming out of
the idea oven hot and fresh.

05:41.198 --> 05:42.231
Let's see what you got.

05:42.333 --> 05:43.799
All right.

05:43.901 --> 05:45.367
Chris Brown is walking to the store.

05:45.469 --> 05:46.704
Did he just say Chris Brown?

05:46.729 --> 05:48.395
Chris Brown is getting his
baby some diapers, right?

05:48.408 --> 05:49.884
Chris Brown's having a bad
day 'cause he just found out

05:49.909 --> 05:51.319
that his woman is cheating on him,

05:51.344 --> 05:52.554
and the baby he been
buying all these diapers

05:52.579 --> 05:53.955
and groceries and shit for

05:53.980 --> 05:56.314
is not even his baby,
and he's got to piss.

05:56.416 --> 05:57.749
The baby or Chris Brown?

05:57.774 --> 05:59.445
Chris Brown. The baby's dead.

05:59.470 --> 06:00.785
- Oh, for sure.
- Yeah, yeah. Of course.

06:00.887 --> 06:02.253
So then he can't even hold it anymore.

06:02.278 --> 06:03.598
He's like, "Oh, I got
to go to a restaurant."

06:03.623 --> 06:05.312
I got to pee immediately," right?

06:05.337 --> 06:06.815
Bam. He goes to the restaurant,

06:06.840 --> 06:08.116
but the restaurant has a restroom

06:08.218 --> 06:09.651
that says, "For whites only."

06:09.754 --> 06:11.153
He's like, "What?"

06:11.255 --> 06:12.765
"For whites only?"
Then he thinks about it,

06:12.790 --> 06:14.490
like, "wait a minute, I
got all these diapers."

06:14.592 --> 06:16.258
So next thing you know, we cut. Bam.

06:16.361 --> 06:17.893
We see the back of Chris
Brown's legs, right?

06:17.996 --> 06:19.929
Then a big-ass dick
falls out of his drawers.

06:20.031 --> 06:21.831
It's like, oh, he might have a disease.

06:21.933 --> 06:23.799
Way too big for sex or anything,

06:23.901 --> 06:25.501
and he's pissing in the
diaper, and it's like...

06:29.240 --> 06:30.773
He looks back at the camera and says,

06:30.875 --> 06:34.176
They can hold a man's piss."

06:34.278 --> 06:36.412
I mean, it's great stuff, Ned.

06:36.514 --> 06:38.147
Just one problem.

06:38.249 --> 06:40.850
I mean, we don't have
the "diapers" account.

06:40.952 --> 06:43.619
Even if we did I'm pretty sure
we can't show any of that stuff.

06:43.721 --> 06:45.321
- Yeah.
- Okay, I got more.

06:45.423 --> 06:47.023
- I'm not married to anything.
- Right.

06:47.125 --> 06:48.824
Next one. A guy's running
from the cops, right?

06:48.926 --> 06:50.459
He's running fast. "Get down!

06:50.561 --> 06:52.728
We got a runner!"

06:53.831 --> 06:55.731
Right?

06:55.833 --> 06:57.500
He has on Reeboks. So fast!

06:57.602 --> 06:58.834
The police have on Nikes.

06:58.936 --> 07:00.302
Hell, no, they're not gon' catch him.

07:00.405 --> 07:01.303
He about to run to the finish line.

07:01.406 --> 07:03.005
Ha! Victory!

07:03.107 --> 07:05.074
Got away from the police! Bam!

07:05.176 --> 07:07.443
They shoot him. He dead.

07:07.545 --> 07:10.913
Reeboks. He dead.

07:11.015 --> 07:12.748
- What else you got?
- Ready for this one?

07:12.850 --> 07:15.117
Okay, a guy's sticking his dick
all in a big-ass tub of butter.

07:15.219 --> 07:16.819
- Oh, lord. Uh-huh.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:16.921 --> 07:18.654
He just, boop, dropping
holes in the butter.

07:18.756 --> 07:19.989
Boop, dropping holes in the butter.

07:20.091 --> 07:21.323
Boop, dropping holes in the butter...

07:21.426 --> 07:22.892
Dick holes. Next thing you know,

07:22.994 --> 07:25.194
the cops come, shoot him. He dead.

07:25.296 --> 07:27.830
Butter. He dead.

07:27.932 --> 07:29.565
- Okay.
- There's a guy

07:29.667 --> 07:32.234
walking around town dancing
with his hand in his pocket.

07:35.273 --> 07:37.373
Okay, and then what happens?

07:37.475 --> 07:38.941
He just dances. That's it.

07:39.043 --> 07:41.177
Okay. Well, Ned, this is all great stuff

07:41.279 --> 07:42.678
and we'd love to hear
it, but we got actually

07:42.780 --> 07:45.281
a really important
meeting we got to get to.

07:45.383 --> 07:49.018
Gentlemen, Dale Diebenkorn is here

07:49.120 --> 07:51.754
and he's stinking up the place.

07:51.856 --> 07:54.757
"No sale" Dale.

07:54.859 --> 07:57.093
That guy is a fricking pud.

07:57.195 --> 07:58.861
Can't believe we're gonna be
in here stuck with that idiot

07:58.963 --> 08:00.596
instead of out there
on our crotch rocket.

08:00.698 --> 08:02.398
We've been pitching to this choad

08:02.500 --> 08:05.234
for a year and a half, and
he's never bought anything.

08:05.336 --> 08:08.370
Tim, Cramblin-Duvet's doing what?

08:08.473 --> 08:09.939
Gangbusters.

08:09.964 --> 08:12.074
Maybe it's time we decided
whether we want to be

08:12.176 --> 08:14.168
in here making a living

08:14.192 --> 08:16.702
or out there making a life.

08:16.781 --> 08:18.314
I get you.

08:20.818 --> 08:22.051
Can I have these?

08:22.153 --> 08:23.285
Dale, I'd like to introduce you

08:23.387 --> 08:27.323
to our brand new hot
shot copywriter Ned.

08:27.425 --> 08:29.024
You're in really good hands.

08:29.127 --> 08:30.626
Ned's going to walk you
through some of our ideas

08:30.728 --> 08:33.294
that we're really excited about.

08:33.397 --> 08:34.830
Put 'er there, Dale.

08:34.932 --> 08:37.433
Man, you got a nice-ass
neck, you know that?

08:37.534 --> 08:39.135
You can tell a lot about
a man by his neck, man,

08:39.236 --> 08:40.456
and you got a strong one.

08:40.481 --> 08:41.647
Uh, thanks.

08:41.672 --> 08:44.059
Sweet! We'll get out of your hair.

08:44.675 --> 08:46.999
It's almost like a
Benjamin Franklin neck.

08:48.045 --> 08:50.412
You kind of got a Benjamin
Franklin whole head.

09:24.415 --> 09:26.949
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

09:30.087 --> 09:32.121
I am gonna miss the hog today,

09:32.223 --> 09:34.089
but we got to get
back to the real world.

09:34.192 --> 09:35.932
Back to the grind.

09:36.427 --> 09:37.626
Morning, Sheila.

09:37.728 --> 09:39.195
Good morning, gentlemen.

09:39.297 --> 09:40.696
Where are you two going?

09:40.798 --> 09:42.364
To stuff all this equipment into my car

09:42.466 --> 09:45.134
because you two idiots didn't buy a van.

09:45.236 --> 09:47.169
Hey guys, nice jackets.

09:47.271 --> 09:48.838
- Thank you.
- I've always worn this.

09:50.675 --> 09:52.274
All right. Appreciate everything.

09:52.376 --> 09:53.809
Oh, hey, guys.

09:53.911 --> 09:55.377
You were right about Ned.

09:55.479 --> 09:56.812
He's amazing.

09:56.914 --> 09:58.647
This commercial's going to be great.

09:58.749 --> 09:59.615
Sure is.

09:59.717 --> 10:00.649
What commercial?

10:00.751 --> 10:01.851
Oh, Dale's commercial.

10:01.953 --> 10:03.519
Oh, no, Ned's commercial.

10:03.621 --> 10:05.387
Let's go shoot this bitch.

10:05.489 --> 10:06.684
Let's do it.

10:08.025 --> 10:09.625
Well, good luck.

10:09.727 --> 10:12.061
I guess we got to get
to this commercial shoot?

10:12.163 --> 10:15.064
Yeah. I mean, I guess it'd
be totally irresponsible

10:15.166 --> 10:16.565
to leave an entire shoot to Ned

10:16.667 --> 10:18.934
and just go riding
around on a hog all day.

10:19.036 --> 10:21.136
Oh, for sure.

10:21.239 --> 10:26.242
If I gave even the smallest
shit about Dale's pud ass,

10:26.344 --> 10:28.110
I'd put a stop to this right now.

10:28.212 --> 10:31.647
And plus my crotch is
throbbin' for a rocket.

10:31.749 --> 10:34.717
Oh. My crotch is achin' for one!

10:34.819 --> 10:37.036
- Let's do this, baby.
- Let's do it.

10:38.789 --> 10:40.356
- Night, Sheila.
- Night, Sheila.

10:40.458 --> 10:42.358
Good night, gentlemen.

10:49.267 --> 10:50.769
Other way, Tommy.

10:57.041 --> 10:58.774
What the heck?

11:05.541 --> 11:09.276
- Stay safe, guys.
- See ya, guys. Good times.

11:09.378 --> 11:11.511
<i>Earlier today, the ghost of a pedophile</i>

11:11.613 --> 11:14.414
<i>was spotted haunting the
old Boblo amusement park.</i>

11:14.516 --> 11:16.049
<i>Here's the interesting thing:</i>

11:16.151 --> 11:20.187
<i>The ghost was... Get this... a woman.</i>

11:20.289 --> 11:21.855
<i>More after these messages.</i>

11:23.471 --> 11:25.169
Oh, look, it's Ned's commercial.

11:25.194 --> 11:27.060
<i>Right now at Detroit Optical Glasses,</i>

11:27.162 --> 11:29.696
<i>we have hunky specs, but be warned:</i>

11:29.798 --> 11:32.566
<i>Hunky specs will make
you feel like grooving.</i>

11:43.946 --> 11:45.712
<i>- Freeze!
- Sorry, officers.</i>

11:45.814 --> 11:48.352
<i>Can't freeze. I got to dance.</i>

11:48.377 --> 11:50.010
<i>He's resisting.</i>

11:50.035 --> 11:52.569
<i>Stop resisting!</i>

11:52.594 --> 11:54.861
<i>Hunky specs will make
you feel like grooving.</i>

11:55.324 --> 11:56.923
<i>Only at
D-O-G.</i>

11:56.948 --> 11:59.883
<i>But I'm white!</i>

11:59.985 --> 12:01.985
<i>Presented by Cramblin Advertising.</i>

12:02.010 --> 12:05.411
Oh, man. That was bad.

12:05.542 --> 12:08.076
I can't believe Ned put a
title card at the end of it.

12:08.101 --> 12:10.647
Now everybody'going to
think we made that turd.

12:10.672 --> 12:12.572
Dale's probably so pissed.

12:12.597 --> 12:14.597
Should we call him and ask him
if he wants us to pull the spot?

12:14.776 --> 12:16.443
<i>- Yeah, maybe.
- I don't usually comment</i>

12:16.545 --> 12:17.611
<i>on the commercials,</i>

12:17.713 --> 12:19.813
<i>but that was a lot of fun.</i>

12:19.915 --> 12:21.615
<i>Let's see it again. Can we?</i>

12:25.053 --> 12:26.653
<i>Right now at Detroit Optical Glasses...</i>

12:26.755 --> 12:29.623
What... The... Whoo-hoo.

12:29.725 --> 12:32.092
<i>Hunky specs that make
you feel like grooving.</i>

12:32.194 --> 12:34.094
I got to get me some
of those horny specs.

12:39.576 --> 12:41.162
<i>I don't get it.</i>

12:41.895 --> 12:43.895
Are they laughing with it or at it?

12:44.061 --> 12:46.201
They're just laughing, Sam.

12:47.063 --> 12:48.863
They're feeling joy.

12:48.965 --> 12:50.064
I don't get it.

12:50.166 --> 12:51.532
It's nothing!

12:51.634 --> 12:53.134
Stop dancing!

12:53.236 --> 12:55.102
You're wasting your time!

12:55.204 --> 12:57.004
Don't look at me, asshole!

12:58.908 --> 13:01.409
Sebastian, how was Dubai?

13:01.511 --> 13:03.411
Oh, incredible.

13:03.513 --> 13:04.979
You know, I went to the Burj Khalifa

13:05.081 --> 13:07.381
and I did that thing that Tom Cruise did

13:07.483 --> 13:08.983
Impossible."

13:09.085 --> 13:11.185
Oh. You climbed up the
windows with suction cups?

13:11.287 --> 13:14.189
I got to wear the mask
of another man's face.

13:14.590 --> 13:16.023
Holy shit.

13:16.125 --> 13:17.364
That's cool.

13:17.930 --> 13:19.350
So Sebastian,

13:19.429 --> 13:21.028
we're going to be shooting
your commercial tomorrow.

13:21.130 --> 13:23.264
Uh, any questions or concerns?

13:23.366 --> 13:26.357
Actually, yes. Uh, let's scrap it.

13:27.070 --> 13:28.369
What?

13:28.471 --> 13:31.172
Yeah. I want the dance.

13:31.274 --> 13:32.206
The dance?

13:32.308 --> 13:34.208
Yes, you know. The hunky specs.

13:34.310 --> 13:36.210
Yeah, yeah. I want... I want that.

13:36.312 --> 13:40.347
Okay, uh, what if we just
added a dance component

13:40.450 --> 13:42.983
to the commercial that
we already pitched you?

13:43.086 --> 13:45.586
Yeah, like, uh, what if,

13:45.688 --> 13:47.822
like, maybe the dad in the tent

13:47.924 --> 13:50.424
kind of, like, wiggles his booty?

13:50.526 --> 13:51.892
Oh, yeah, yeah, he
makes his booty clap.

13:51.994 --> 13:53.761
Oh, that's good.

13:53.863 --> 13:55.496
Actually, that's great.
You know, that could work.

13:55.598 --> 13:56.864
- It definitely could.
- Guys, guys, guys.

13:56.966 --> 13:58.933
Don't leave me half-hard here.

13:59.035 --> 14:01.068
Why are we talking about the old ad?

14:01.170 --> 14:04.371
I want the full-on dance treatment.

14:04.474 --> 14:06.248
That's what I want.

14:07.110 --> 14:08.809
All right. Okay.

14:08.911 --> 14:10.745
Um... So, okay.

14:10.847 --> 14:12.446
All right, so maybe you're, um,

14:12.548 --> 14:14.248
maybe you're walking through your store,

14:14.273 --> 14:15.750
you look to camera, you're just like...

14:39.342 --> 14:40.641
Why would I do that?

14:42.578 --> 14:43.688
I don't know, sir.

14:43.713 --> 14:44.961
It's not sexy.

14:47.884 --> 14:50.818
Uh, well, actually, what if
the dance is more like, uh...

14:52.922 --> 14:55.156
Okay.

14:55.258 --> 14:58.592
Feel it. Feel it.

14:58.694 --> 15:01.128
You feel it.

15:01.230 --> 15:03.864
You just kind of feel it.

15:03.966 --> 15:06.000
You're gonna... ooh.

15:06.102 --> 15:07.201
Oh, there's something in my tummy.

15:07.303 --> 15:09.136
It's more groovin'.

15:09.238 --> 15:10.171
It's groovin'.

15:10.273 --> 15:11.772
Now it's a baby.

15:11.874 --> 15:13.841
There it is.

15:15.645 --> 15:19.321
Fellas, is this some sort of joke?

15:19.816 --> 15:22.850
Because I consider myself
a really chill dude,

15:22.952 --> 15:24.518
but you are pissing me off.

15:24.620 --> 15:25.853
Now, what happened to the guys who

15:25.955 --> 15:28.355
came up with the hunky
specs commercial, huh?

15:30.226 --> 15:32.526
Look, you have every right to be angry.

15:33.830 --> 15:36.730
Please allow us a moment to discuss.

15:41.504 --> 15:42.703
No.

15:48.811 --> 15:49.864
What are we gonna do now?

15:49.889 --> 15:50.988
I don't know.

15:51.013 --> 15:52.680
I honestly thought my dancing was sexy.

15:52.782 --> 15:54.181
Gentlemen.

15:54.283 --> 15:56.550
Jean and Louise Strhol

15:56.652 --> 16:00.421
from Strhol's Icecream
are here to see you.

16:01.757 --> 16:03.324
Strhol's Icecream?

16:03.426 --> 16:06.527
We have been trying to get a
meeting with them for months.

16:06.629 --> 16:09.263
This is huge. Where are they?

16:09.365 --> 16:11.532
I put them in the conference room.

16:17.240 --> 16:20.140
Son of a bitch.

16:20.243 --> 16:21.219
Crap.

16:25.681 --> 16:27.633
Hello, Mother.

16:28.317 --> 16:29.550
Sheila, can you tell Ned

16:29.652 --> 16:31.385
he has two clients waiting for him?

16:31.487 --> 16:32.820
Where are you two going?

16:32.922 --> 16:34.350
Doesn't matter.

16:36.792 --> 16:40.160
Good-bye, Mother.

16:40.270 --> 16:41.344
Bitch.

17:36.886 --> 17:39.753
If you could start over and
do any job in the entire world,

17:39.855 --> 17:42.022
what would you do?

17:42.124 --> 17:43.924
Probably make commercials
at Cramblin-Duvet.

17:44.026 --> 17:45.141
Me too.

17:45.761 --> 17:48.862
What would you do if
you had $10 million?

17:48.965 --> 17:50.431
I'd expand Cramblin-Duvet,

17:50.533 --> 17:53.033
get a bigger building
with on-site daycare.

17:54.570 --> 17:55.846
Can I be honest with you, Sam?

17:55.871 --> 17:57.020
Yeah, bud.

17:57.573 --> 18:00.541
I am scared every second on that thing.

18:00.643 --> 18:02.977
Tim, I hate it. If you stop, you fall.

18:03.079 --> 18:04.478
Yeah, and if you fall, you die.

18:04.580 --> 18:06.046
Yeah, and then you
die, it just goes black.

18:06.148 --> 18:07.648
You don't even hear anything.

18:07.750 --> 18:09.316
Why would they make
something that does that?

18:09.418 --> 18:10.851
I mean, I don't even like being outside.

18:10.953 --> 18:12.386
No, me neither. Let's get out of here.

18:12.488 --> 18:14.188
I just saw one of those
big, fat, fuzzy bees.

18:19.929 --> 18:21.477
Nice bike.

18:23.022 --> 18:24.298
It's yours.

18:25.247 --> 18:26.246
Need a helmet?

18:26.271 --> 18:28.104
Don't need one.

18:40.616 --> 18:41.915
Hey, guys.

18:42.018 --> 18:44.852
Ned. What are you doing down here?

18:44.954 --> 18:47.654
Guys, thanks for letting
me work for the company.

18:47.757 --> 18:50.057
I really appreciate
it, great experience.

18:50.159 --> 18:54.228
But I found I like my
ideas better as ideas.

18:54.330 --> 18:55.696
You know, 'cause once
the money gets involved,

18:55.798 --> 18:57.698
is it even art anymore?

18:57.800 --> 19:00.267
Plus, the ice cream ladies
really, really didn't like

19:00.369 --> 19:01.568
the commercial I made for them.

19:01.670 --> 19:03.237
- Oh, no.
- What'd you do, Ned?

19:03.339 --> 19:05.272
I had a guy put his
dick in the ice cream.

19:05.374 --> 19:07.074
Yeah, you can't do that.

19:07.176 --> 19:08.642
Yeah. It turns out they don't like that.

19:08.744 --> 19:09.743
But they're wrong.

19:09.845 --> 19:11.311
- No, I know.
- Yeah.

19:11.414 --> 19:12.880
- I know.
- Good luck, Ned.

19:12.982 --> 19:14.748
You guys hang in there,
man. It's tough up there.

19:19.066 --> 19:21.032
You know, fellas, I'm sorry.

19:21.134 --> 19:22.534
After talking to Ned,

19:22.636 --> 19:25.971
I think I want to go
back to the first idea.

19:26.073 --> 19:28.173
Yeah, I think that is a great call.

19:28.275 --> 19:29.174
You're cool with that?

19:29.276 --> 19:30.475
- Yes. Yes.
- Yes.

19:30.577 --> 19:32.043
Unless of course Ned
can get Chris Brown.

19:33.113 --> 19:34.723
He cannot.

19:40.153 --> 19:42.854
It's Lea.

19:42.956 --> 19:44.389
And Tommy pencils.

19:44.491 --> 19:46.291
They got a van.

19:47.394 --> 19:48.760
- You got the van?
- Yep,

19:48.862 --> 19:50.395
and it was even cheaper.
The guy who bought it

19:50.497 --> 19:52.297
at the police auction
was murdered in it.

19:52.399 --> 19:54.319
- Oh, score.
- Oh, and Tommy has

19:54.344 --> 19:55.410
a surprise for you.

19:55.435 --> 19:56.968
He worked really hard on it.

19:57.070 --> 19:58.837
Be nice.

20:02.943 --> 20:05.210
Ta-da!

20:05.235 --> 20:06.660
Is that us?

20:07.614 --> 20:10.315
Yes it is, fellas. Do you like it?

20:10.417 --> 20:12.317
Yeah. Good job, Tommy.

20:12.419 --> 20:13.918
Great job, Tommy.

20:14.021 --> 20:17.322
Yeah, great job, Tommy.

20:17.347 --> 20:19.567
I like how you captured my pink lips.

20:20.127 --> 20:23.762
Yeah, I like how you captured
my little corn cob mouth.

20:23.864 --> 20:26.998
And my raccoon mask,
and my gray, gray skin.

20:27.100 --> 20:28.600
- Yellow ears.
- Yellow nose, too.

20:28.702 --> 20:29.934
And my double chin.

20:30.037 --> 20:31.503
Make sure you got the
double chin perfectly.

20:31.605 --> 20:33.772
Yeah, no, I see it, man. I see it.

20:33.874 --> 20:37.075
Pube hair, pube eyebrows.

20:37.177 --> 20:38.710
My whole goblin face.

20:38.812 --> 20:40.779
And I got your blue eyes!

20:40.881 --> 20:42.741
Yeah, you did.

20:43.517 --> 20:44.749
Thanks, Tommy.

20:44.851 --> 20:46.418
You're welcome, Tim.
