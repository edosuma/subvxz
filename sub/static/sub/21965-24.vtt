00:03.000 --> 00:07.083
DOCTOR MOROCCO:

00:03.000 --> 00:07.083
The Rescue Bots were simply

00:03.000 --> 00:07.083
too valuable not to steal.

00:07.125 --> 00:09.250
Especially upon discovering

00:09.291 --> 00:11.875
they were aliens

00:09.291 --> 00:11.875
from another world.

00:11.917 --> 00:15.208
Sigma Seventeen Ship Log,

00:11.917 --> 00:15.208
Rescue Bots reporting.

00:15.250 --> 00:17.500
We are departing Cybertron

00:15.250 --> 00:17.500
on a routine patrol

00:17.542 --> 00:19.875
to the Quintessa Quadrant.

00:17.542 --> 00:19.875
DOCTOR MOROCCO:  But how does one

00:19.917 --> 00:24.041
permanently reprogram other

00:19.917 --> 00:24.041
life-forms to follow commands?

00:24.083 --> 00:28.917
Well, I found the answer

00:24.083 --> 00:28.917
in my Chamber of Youth.

00:28.959 --> 00:30.458
It not only keeps me young,

00:30.500 --> 00:32.458
but the Chamber's

00:30.500 --> 00:32.458
Verne Device

00:32.500 --> 00:35.333
can also rewind

00:32.500 --> 00:35.333
years of memories,

00:35.375 --> 00:38.125
as demonstrated on the Mayor.

00:38.166 --> 00:40.250
( groans )

00:38.166 --> 00:40.250
( gasps )

00:40.291 --> 00:44.250
And now the Rescue Bots believe

00:40.291 --> 00:44.250
they've just landed on Earth.

00:44.291 --> 00:46.500
As such, they've been told

00:46.542 --> 00:48.959
that the Burnses'

00:46.542 --> 00:48.959
are their enemies,

00:49.000 --> 00:53.291
and their mission

00:49.000 --> 00:53.291
is to serve me.

00:53.333 --> 00:56.458
A new client, Madeline Pynch,

00:56.500 --> 01:00.458
needed smart robots to mine

00:56.500 --> 01:00.458
gold from beneath Griffin Rock.

01:00.500 --> 01:02.041
She even equipped them

01:02.083 --> 01:04.417
with her own Phase Technology

01:02.083 --> 01:04.417
to do it.

01:07.208 --> 01:10.542
That's when everything went

01:07.208 --> 01:10.542
pear-shaped, as they say.

01:10.583 --> 01:13.041
(  dramatic theme playing  )

01:14.917 --> 01:19.625
Explosions beneath the island

01:14.917 --> 01:19.625
have left me adrift.

01:19.667 --> 01:22.041
Madeline Pynch

01:19.667 --> 01:22.041
has stolen the Nemo,

01:22.083 --> 01:25.041
along with everything on board.

01:25.083 --> 01:28.709
If I don't slip into

01:25.083 --> 01:28.709
my Chamber of Youth soon--

01:28.750 --> 01:31.750
My true age will overtake me.

01:31.792 --> 01:34.375
End Morocco memoirs.

01:36.792 --> 01:41.166
Rescue Bots! Remember,

01:36.792 --> 01:41.166
those humans are your enemies.

01:41.208 --> 01:44.333
Ignore them

01:41.208 --> 01:44.333
and come to my aid at once.

01:46.500 --> 01:50.250
Their com-units are off?

01:46.500 --> 01:50.250
What else can possibly go wrong?

01:50.291 --> 01:52.834
( machinery powering down )

01:52.875 --> 01:57.917
Ugh. One should

01:52.875 --> 01:57.917
never even ask that question.

01:57.959 --> 02:00.500
Heatwave, you really

01:57.959 --> 02:00.500
don't know me?

02:00.542 --> 02:02.875
Oh, what a sight for sore eyes.

02:00.542 --> 02:02.875
What happened to you guys?

02:02.917 --> 02:04.250
We've been so worried.

02:04.291 --> 02:06.875
Uh, why are they

02:04.291 --> 02:06.875
being so nice?

02:06.917 --> 02:09.917
Perhaps this affable

02:06.917 --> 02:09.917
enthusiasm is a fiendish ploy

02:09.959 --> 02:11.417
to disorient us.

02:11.458 --> 02:13.083
So, what's our move?

02:13.125 --> 02:14.959
Yeah, what's our move?

02:16.375 --> 02:19.458
Oh, you're asking me. Okay.

02:19.500 --> 02:21.625
Take them!

02:21.667 --> 02:23.959
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You dent

02:21.667 --> 02:23.959
your heads or something?

02:24.000 --> 02:25.583
They don't recognize us.

02:25.625 --> 02:27.917
Their memories are gone,

02:25.625 --> 02:27.917
just like with the Mayor!

02:27.959 --> 02:31.208
Whoa!

02:27.959 --> 02:31.208
Ahh!

02:27.959 --> 02:31.208
Look out!

Why'd you change your mind?

03:43.041 --> 03:45.208
Enemies or not,

03:45.250 --> 03:48.709
it felt like something

03:45.250 --> 03:48.709
rescuers should do.

03:52.166 --> 03:54.250
Is everyone all right?

03:54.291 --> 03:58.417
Yeah, but what just happened?

03:58.458 --> 04:00.041
Was that a tidal wave?

04:00.083 --> 04:03.959
If it was, the water

04:00.083 --> 04:03.959
should be receding.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.542
It's almost like the island

04:04.000 --> 04:06.542
sank a little.

04:06.583 --> 04:09.166
I wonder if the explosions

04:06.583 --> 04:09.166
are to blame.

04:09.208 --> 04:11.125
Yeah, about that...

04:11.166 --> 04:14.583
Tell us what is going on. What

04:11.166 --> 04:14.583
were you four doing underground?

04:14.625 --> 04:16.750
We were told to mine the--

04:14.625 --> 04:16.750
BLADES: Ap-ap-ap!

04:16.792 --> 04:19.583
Say nothing

04:16.792 --> 04:19.583
until we receive new orders.

04:19.625 --> 04:21.458
Orders? From whom?

04:21.500 --> 04:22.959
From Doct--

04:21.500 --> 04:22.959
Ap-ap!

04:23.000 --> 04:25.208
Blades, I think--

04:23.000 --> 04:25.208
Ap!

04:25.250 --> 04:27.583
But we need to know what's

04:25.250 --> 04:27.583
happening to the island.

04:27.625 --> 04:30.250
Just come home with us,

04:27.625 --> 04:30.250
and you can contact Optimus.

04:30.291 --> 04:32.125
He'll tell you

04:30.291 --> 04:32.125
we're your friends.

04:32.166 --> 04:35.500
I'm sorry, does that not sound

04:32.166 --> 04:35.500
like a trap to anyone else?

04:35.542 --> 04:37.250
I say it's worth

04:35.542 --> 04:37.250
checking out.

04:37.291 --> 04:39.125
Good, time's wasting.

04:39.166 --> 04:41.000
Rescue Bots, vehicle mode.

04:41.041 --> 04:43.000
Uh, why?

04:43.041 --> 04:46.542
You're not thinking

04:43.041 --> 04:46.542
of occupying our seats, are you?

04:46.583 --> 04:50.709
Uh, of course not.

04:46.583 --> 04:50.709
Follow us.

04:50.750 --> 04:52.875
(  dramatic theme playing  )

04:55.834 --> 04:58.166
( ground rumbling )

04:55.834 --> 04:58.166
Gah!

05:03.041 --> 05:05.417
(  dramatic theme playing  )

05:19.125 --> 05:20.750
( panting )

05:27.792 --> 05:30.458
What is the ruckus?

05:30.500 --> 05:33.125
A comment about

05:30.500 --> 05:33.125
the rumors, Mayor?

05:33.166 --> 05:35.417
Rumors? Yeah...

05:35.458 --> 05:38.834
Whatever the scandal, I vow

05:35.458 --> 05:38.834
to get to the bottom of it.

05:38.875 --> 05:41.750
My administration is--

05:38.875 --> 05:41.750
The rising water, Mayor.

05:41.792 --> 05:45.333
Could Griffin Rock

05:41.792 --> 05:45.333
actually be sinking?

05:45.375 --> 05:47.208
That's preposterous.

05:47.250 --> 05:49.959
Especially during

05:47.250 --> 05:49.959
my first month in office!

05:50.000 --> 05:53.875
I'll call Professor Plummer

05:50.000 --> 05:53.875
as soon as I finish my lunch.

05:53.917 --> 05:55.959
Mm, this is delicious.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.500
Y-You mean Doc Greene? Plummer

05:56.000 --> 06:00.500
retired from the lab years ago.

06:00.542 --> 06:02.417
( sighs )

06:02.458 --> 06:05.709
Believe it or not, that's one

06:02.458 --> 06:05.709
of his more lucid interviews.

06:07.083 --> 06:08.959
HEATWAVE:

06:07.083 --> 06:08.959
We can reach Optimus from here?

06:09.000 --> 06:10.667
In a garage?

06:10.709 --> 06:12.208
Of course not.

06:12.250 --> 06:14.709
We're taking you down

06:12.250 --> 06:14.709
into the Secret Bunker.

06:14.750 --> 06:17.208
( machinery beeping )

06:19.208 --> 06:21.959
Where no one can hear

06:19.208 --> 06:21.959
you scream?

06:23.875 --> 06:25.208
It is a trap!

06:25.250 --> 06:27.250
(  dramatic theme playing  )

06:30.250 --> 06:32.583
No, no, look through there. See?

06:37.208 --> 06:39.375
Hey, that's our equipment.

06:39.417 --> 06:40.709
From our ship.

06:42.417 --> 06:44.542
Which is parked in

06:42.417 --> 06:44.542
our underground hangar.

06:54.750 --> 06:57.667
Rescue Force Sigma 17

06:54.750 --> 06:57.667
to Optimus Prime, do you read?

06:59.625 --> 07:01.834
Told you.

07:01.875 --> 07:04.542
BOULDER:

07:01.875 --> 07:04.542
Guys? Maybe they're

07:01.875 --> 07:04.542
telling the truth.

07:06.166 --> 07:08.083
We took that photo

07:06.166 --> 07:08.083
on the one-year anniversary

07:08.125 --> 07:09.959
of your arrival.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.709
We've been here that long?

07:10.000 --> 07:12.709
Then what's our mission?

07:12.750 --> 07:17.291
To be our rescue partners.

07:12.750 --> 07:17.291
And to learn the ways of humans.

07:17.333 --> 07:20.542
But then you guys kind of

07:17.333 --> 07:20.542
became our best friends.

07:20.583 --> 07:23.083
Well, I don't know

07:20.583 --> 07:23.083
about "best," but--

07:24.125 --> 07:26.709
Okay, top two or three.

07:28.166 --> 07:30.667
Fine. Tell them

07:28.166 --> 07:30.667
everything.

07:30.709 --> 07:34.208
Doctor Morocco had us mining

07:30.709 --> 07:34.208
gold from under the island.

07:34.250 --> 07:37.166
Morocco.

07:34.250 --> 07:37.166
That explains plenty.

07:37.208 --> 07:39.417
We were also presented

07:37.208 --> 07:39.417
with phasing technology

07:39.458 --> 07:41.500
that allowed us

07:39.458 --> 07:41.500
to enter sealed caverns.

07:41.542 --> 07:45.250
Very useful. If only they

07:41.542 --> 07:45.250
weren't lost in the explosion.

07:45.291 --> 07:48.667
Wait, the same tech Doc Greene

07:45.291 --> 07:48.667
was making for a client?

07:48.709 --> 07:50.542
Not just any client.

07:50.583 --> 07:53.166
Doc did some research

07:50.583 --> 07:53.166
and came up with a name.

07:53.208 --> 07:54.875
Madeline Pynch.

07:54.917 --> 07:57.000
The original gold digger.

07:57.041 --> 08:01.208
Morocco and Pynch on one team?

07:57.041 --> 08:01.208
No wonder something blew up.

08:01.250 --> 08:04.250
Those caverns,

08:01.250 --> 08:04.250
they were full of methane gas.

08:04.291 --> 08:05.542
Only took a spark.

08:05.583 --> 08:07.542
There must have been

08:05.583 --> 08:07.542
a chain reaction

08:07.583 --> 08:09.875
when other pockets

08:07.583 --> 08:09.875
of methane exploded.

08:09.917 --> 08:12.041
Now all the tunnels

08:09.917 --> 08:12.041
have started to collapse,

08:12.083 --> 08:13.417
lowering the island.

08:13.458 --> 08:17.583
So it's true.

08:13.458 --> 08:17.583
Griffin Rock is sinking.

08:17.625 --> 08:20.583
Probably won't be anything left

08:17.625 --> 08:20.583
but the mountaintops.

08:20.625 --> 08:23.959
We'll need to evacuate...

08:20.625 --> 08:23.959
forever.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.333
I'll call the Mayor.

08:25.375 --> 08:27.125
I'll have the Coast Guard

08:25.375 --> 08:27.125
send boats.

08:27.166 --> 08:29.834
I'll issue a warning for people

08:27.166 --> 08:29.834
to seek higher ground.

08:29.875 --> 08:33.125
And I'll warm up

08:29.875 --> 08:33.125
some hot wings.

08:33.166 --> 08:35.834
What? We might not

08:33.166 --> 08:35.834
eat for awhile.

08:35.875 --> 08:39.375
I guess it's good you guys don't

08:35.875 --> 08:39.375
have memories of Griffin Rock.

08:39.417 --> 08:42.166
Saying goodbye

08:39.417 --> 08:42.166
will be a lot easier for you.

08:43.792 --> 08:46.291
What did we do?

08:46.333 --> 08:48.917
(  dramatic theme playing  )

09:10.834 --> 09:13.000
Someone get us down!

09:13.041 --> 09:15.375
Help!

09:13.041 --> 09:15.375
We're stranded up here!

09:18.250 --> 09:20.709
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

09:20.750 --> 09:22.417
It's gonna explode!

09:22.458 --> 09:24.333
Someone help us!

09:25.750 --> 09:27.709
( gasps )

09:27.750 --> 09:28.959
Boulder, Chase,

09:29.000 --> 09:30.875
move that tanker

09:29.000 --> 09:30.875
before it blows!

09:30.917 --> 09:32.750
Heatwave,

09:30.917 --> 09:32.750
douse the structure fire.

09:32.792 --> 09:35.125
Blades, get those people

09:32.792 --> 09:35.125
off the roof.

09:35.166 --> 09:37.875
And you're all taking

09:35.166 --> 09:37.875
your partners.

09:37.917 --> 09:39.375
You got it.

09:39.417 --> 09:41.083
(  dramatic theme playing  )

09:44.959 --> 09:47.792
Cody, check

09:44.959 --> 09:47.792
for other emergencies.

09:47.834 --> 09:50.208
( sirens blaring )

09:59.250 --> 10:02.125
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

10:07.208 --> 10:08.542
Get in! Hurry!

10:12.083 --> 10:14.083
( all grunting )

10:19.250 --> 10:21.000
Submerge the whole truck!

10:23.166 --> 10:25.208
( both grunting )

10:29.458 --> 10:31.166
( grunts )

10:35.166 --> 10:37.166
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

11:00.500 --> 11:02.125
Cody, any other calls?

11:02.166 --> 11:03.875
No. Everyone made it

11:02.166 --> 11:03.875
to the mountains.

11:03.917 --> 11:06.542
But evacuation boats

11:03.917 --> 11:06.542
are still an hour out.

11:06.583 --> 11:09.458
Look, if part of our mission

11:06.583 --> 11:09.458
is keeping you safe,

11:09.500 --> 11:11.125
you need to head

11:09.500 --> 11:11.125
for the hills, too.

11:11.166 --> 11:14.500
No, we're emergency responders.

11:11.166 --> 11:14.500
We're staying put.

11:14.542 --> 11:16.542
We hold to a similar oath.

11:16.583 --> 11:18.208
So we're in this together?

11:18.250 --> 11:21.041
Wouldn't have it any other way.

11:18.250 --> 11:21.041
But now we need a plan.

11:21.083 --> 11:24.709
Yeah, some way to stop those

11:21.083 --> 11:24.709
tunnels from collapsing anymore.

11:24.750 --> 11:28.041
How come the train tunnel

11:24.750 --> 11:28.041
is holding up?

11:28.083 --> 11:31.208
It must be because we reinforced

11:28.083 --> 11:31.208
that area with hardening foam.

11:31.250 --> 11:34.125
Then why can't the foam work

11:31.250 --> 11:34.125
on the other tunnels?

11:34.166 --> 11:35.875
Graham?

11:34.166 --> 11:35.875
It might.

11:35.917 --> 11:38.625
If we hurry and disperse it

11:35.917 --> 11:38.625
through the main tunnels.

11:38.667 --> 11:41.583
You need speed,

11:38.667 --> 11:41.583
we're your rides.

11:41.625 --> 11:43.041
Then lets get to Doc's.

11:43.083 --> 11:47.959
DOCTOR MOROCCO:

11:43.083 --> 11:47.959
Hello? Hello? Hello!

11:48.000 --> 11:50.375
Uh-oh.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.375
That sounds kinda like--

11:52.083 --> 11:53.709
Is anyone there?

11:55.458 --> 12:00.333
Ah! My Rescue Bots!

11:55.458 --> 12:00.333
Thank the distant stars.

12:00.375 --> 12:04.750
I hereby instruct you

12:00.375 --> 12:04.750
to chase down my stolen Nemo.

12:04.792 --> 12:08.458
Don't take this the wrong way,

12:04.792 --> 12:08.458
but...uh-uh.

12:08.500 --> 12:10.917
Have you forgotten

12:08.500 --> 12:10.917
you work for me?

12:10.959 --> 12:14.166
CHIEF:

12:10.959 --> 12:14.166
Not anymore, Morocco.

12:14.208 --> 12:17.000
Erasing their memories

12:14.208 --> 12:17.000
doesn't change who they are.

12:17.041 --> 12:19.542
They're heroes,

12:17.041 --> 12:19.542
not your minions.

12:19.583 --> 12:22.875
Ah, hello. I'd come over

12:19.583 --> 12:22.875
and greet you properly,

12:22.917 --> 12:25.250
but my sub is disabled.

12:25.291 --> 12:28.709
Dude, not that I normally care

12:25.291 --> 12:28.709
about appearances, but...

12:28.750 --> 12:30.083
You're looking old.

12:30.125 --> 12:33.667
Only temporarily, I assure you.

12:33.709 --> 12:36.875
Nothing that's been done

12:33.709 --> 12:36.875
cannot be undone.

12:36.917 --> 12:39.291
Age, memories.

12:39.333 --> 12:42.041
You're saying you can

12:39.333 --> 12:42.041
restore the Bots' memories?

12:42.083 --> 12:45.166
Well, of course.

12:42.083 --> 12:45.166
If only the technology

12:45.208 --> 12:48.375
wasn't in the thieving hands

12:45.208 --> 12:48.375
of Madeline Pynch.

12:48.417 --> 12:50.667
Sounds like someone

12:48.417 --> 12:50.667
got double-crossed.

12:50.709 --> 12:53.959
So if we track down

12:50.709 --> 12:53.959
your sea lab, then what?

12:54.000 --> 12:56.291
We all get on with our lives.

12:56.333 --> 12:57.959
HEATWAVE:

12:56.333 --> 12:57.959
Forget it.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.625
We're not going anywhere

12:58.000 --> 13:00.625
until we save this island.

13:00.667 --> 13:05.458
No! I mean, you'll never

13:00.667 --> 13:05.458
catch her if you wait.

13:05.500 --> 13:08.041
Your memories

13:05.500 --> 13:08.041
will be gone forever.

13:08.083 --> 13:09.667
Then so be it.

13:09.709 --> 13:12.041
Wherever there is an emergency,

13:09.709 --> 13:12.041
there are Rescue Bots,

13:12.083 --> 13:14.125
ready to serve,

13:12.083 --> 13:14.125
save and protect.

13:14.166 --> 13:16.041
Vehicle modes!

13:17.875 --> 13:20.333
(  dramatic theme playing  )

13:22.750 --> 13:25.166
I'd say don't leave town...

13:25.208 --> 13:27.458
but it looks like

13:25.208 --> 13:27.458
you're stuck here.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.959
(  dramatic theme playing  )

13:46.625 --> 13:48.291
DOC GREENE:

13:46.625 --> 13:48.291
These little wonders

13:48.333 --> 13:50.500
are actually part of a project

13:48.333 --> 13:50.500
I've been developing

13:50.542 --> 13:52.125
for Kade and Heatwave.

13:52.166 --> 13:55.542
Toss them into a fire,

13:52.166 --> 13:55.542
trigger a remote, and poomf!

13:55.583 --> 13:57.291
They release flame retardant.

13:57.333 --> 14:00.625
Only now, we loaded them

13:57.333 --> 14:00.625
with hardening foam instead.

14:00.667 --> 14:04.333
Hardening foam that expands.

14:00.667 --> 14:04.333
At least enough to inflate

14:04.375 --> 14:07.250
those tunnels

14:04.375 --> 14:07.250
to their original size.

14:07.291 --> 14:10.041
But how do we get through all

14:07.291 --> 14:10.041
the obstructions down there?

14:10.083 --> 14:11.291
By using these.

14:11.333 --> 14:12.792
Phase Bits.

14:12.834 --> 14:14.542
We still have

14:12.834 --> 14:14.542
four working prototypes

14:14.583 --> 14:16.500
that'll let you dissolve

14:14.583 --> 14:16.500
right through the rock.

14:16.542 --> 14:18.917
Where do we start, Doc?

14:18.959 --> 14:21.166
The underground junction

14:18.959 --> 14:21.166
by the school.

14:21.208 --> 14:22.458
It's still above water.

14:25.458 --> 14:28.333
Sorry, son.

14:25.458 --> 14:28.333
This one's too dangerous.

14:28.375 --> 14:32.208
More dangerous than

14:28.375 --> 14:32.208
being on a sinking island?

14:33.500 --> 14:35.375
I want to be

14:33.500 --> 14:35.375
with my family, Dad.

14:37.792 --> 14:41.000
BLADES:

14:37.792 --> 14:41.000
Rescue Bots, soar to the rescue!

14:41.041 --> 14:43.166
Why are you

14:41.041 --> 14:43.166
calling the shots?

14:43.208 --> 14:46.041
That's what team leaders do,

14:43.208 --> 14:46.041
silly.

14:46.083 --> 14:48.208
But Heatwave's

14:46.083 --> 14:48.208
the team leader.

14:48.250 --> 14:51.417
Really? What a relief!

14:51.458 --> 14:53.291
Pfft, I'll say.

14:53.333 --> 14:56.041
Rescue Bots,

14:53.333 --> 14:56.041
roll to the rescue.

14:56.083 --> 14:57.792
(  dramatic theme playing  )

15:05.792 --> 15:07.792
(  dramatic theme playing  )

15:15.583 --> 15:18.291
( alarm sounding )

15:47.500 --> 15:49.500
(  dramatic theme playing  )

15:49.542 --> 15:50.792
Phase on.

16:04.125 --> 16:06.125
( rumbling )

16:08.709 --> 16:11.709
Not much headroom.

16:08.709 --> 16:11.709
We're going in on all fours.

16:15.709 --> 16:18.333
What in the all-spark?

16:20.750 --> 16:25.291
All right, heroes. Time to raise

16:20.750 --> 16:25.291
Griffin Rock from the sea.

16:25.333 --> 16:27.333
(  dramatic theme playing  )

16:28.917 --> 16:30.834
I'll drive, you throw.

16:32.166 --> 16:33.417
( grunts )

16:34.917 --> 16:38.583
Oh, yeah, three years

16:34.917 --> 16:38.583
as a paperboy. Fling!

16:41.500 --> 16:43.583
BLADES:

16:41.500 --> 16:43.583
Aah!

16:43.625 --> 16:45.583
Since I'm not team leader,

16:45.625 --> 16:48.583
I won't pretend

16:45.625 --> 16:48.583
I can do things I can't.

16:48.625 --> 16:50.333
Like fly underground.

16:50.375 --> 16:52.333
You and I

16:50.375 --> 16:52.333
have done this before, Blades.

16:52.375 --> 16:54.041
Trust me, we'll own this.

16:54.083 --> 16:56.583
Uhh, oh, boy.

16:57.667 --> 16:58.917
( grunts )

17:01.709 --> 17:03.166
( grunts )

17:04.542 --> 17:06.542
( beeping )

17:10.291 --> 17:11.542
( grunts )

17:13.333 --> 17:15.333
(  dramatic theme playing  )

17:32.041 --> 17:33.417
Now, Doc!

17:34.917 --> 17:37.208
( beeping )

17:43.125 --> 17:45.625
(  triumphant theme playing  )

18:03.250 --> 18:04.500
Excelsior!

18:04.542 --> 18:06.458
Whoo! Yeah!

18:06.500 --> 18:09.000
( all cheering )

18:11.083 --> 18:13.041
HUXLEY:

18:11.083 --> 18:13.041
You can come down now, Mayor!

18:13.083 --> 18:14.625
The island is saved!

18:14.667 --> 18:16.917
Ah, of course it is.

18:16.959 --> 18:20.291
I told you we had nothing

18:16.959 --> 18:20.291
to worry about.

18:20.333 --> 18:23.458
Wha--?

18:20.333 --> 18:23.458
Ah!

18:23.500 --> 18:25.542
When did I go bald?

18:30.750 --> 18:34.917
Oh, finally, the fickle fates

18:30.750 --> 18:34.917
have tossed me a crumb.

18:39.875 --> 18:42.250
( sighs )

18:45.750 --> 18:47.375
( electricity crackling )

18:53.375 --> 18:54.917
( inhales )

18:54.959 --> 18:59.208
Ah, a sip from the proverbial

18:54.959 --> 18:59.208
Fountain of Youth.

18:59.250 --> 19:01.375
Ha, ha, ha. Refreshing.

19:07.750 --> 19:08.959
KADE:

19:07.750 --> 19:08.959
Well, well, well.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.875
If it isn't Doc Moroc.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.583
Where's your partner in crime?

19:12.625 --> 19:15.083
Eh, zipping to parts unknown

19:15.125 --> 19:17.875
in my escape pod, unfortunately.

19:17.917 --> 19:20.125
Is that the thing that'll

19:17.917 --> 19:20.125
bring back the Bots' memories?

19:20.166 --> 19:21.417
And the Mayor's?

19:22.834 --> 19:24.667
It is.

19:27.291 --> 19:29.208
Chief,

19:27.291 --> 19:29.208
when all is said and done,

19:29.250 --> 19:32.041
remember my willingness to help.

19:34.083 --> 19:35.667
(  dramatic theme playing  )

19:42.375 --> 19:44.667
Blades,

19:42.375 --> 19:44.667
what's your favorite TV show?

19:44.709 --> 19:46.250
What's "TV?"

19:46.291 --> 19:47.834
Oh, no...

19:47.875 --> 19:49.250
CODY:

19:47.875 --> 19:49.250
You said this would work.

19:49.291 --> 19:52.583
Eh, what do I know about aliens?

19:54.166 --> 19:57.917
Chief? This was all

19:54.166 --> 19:57.917
Madeline Pynch's idea!

19:57.959 --> 19:59.959
Chief Burns!

20:03.166 --> 20:04.500
( sighs )

20:04.542 --> 20:07.417
Where is that Phase-Tech

20:04.542 --> 20:07.417
when you need it?

20:08.917 --> 20:10.583
CODY:

20:08.917 --> 20:10.583
Okay. Try remembering this.

20:12.667 --> 20:14.792
You painted it, Boulder.

20:14.834 --> 20:17.500
Sorry. Nice to know

20:14.834 --> 20:17.500
I'm an artist, though.

20:17.542 --> 20:20.208
Any progress?

20:17.542 --> 20:20.208
After two scrap books,

20:20.250 --> 20:22.583
three photo albums,

20:20.250 --> 20:22.583
and a home movie,

20:22.625 --> 20:24.125
we got nothing.

20:24.166 --> 20:26.291
Oh, this is so unfair.

20:26.333 --> 20:28.417
How come that device

20:26.333 --> 20:28.417
gave the Mayor his memory back,

20:28.458 --> 20:29.917
but not the Bots?

20:29.959 --> 20:31.917
They're just built

20:29.959 --> 20:31.917
differently than humans.

20:31.959 --> 20:35.625
Let's not be sad, okay?

20:31.959 --> 20:35.625
We can make all-new memories.

20:35.667 --> 20:37.083
Absolutely.

20:37.125 --> 20:38.792
I rather like

20:37.125 --> 20:38.792
this little human.

20:38.834 --> 20:40.875
Happy thoughts!

20:40.917 --> 20:42.166
Where should we start?

20:42.208 --> 20:44.000
I have an idea.

20:45.959 --> 20:49.917
Alright, no triple-changing

20:45.959 --> 20:49.917
in the goal this time, Heatwave.

20:49.959 --> 20:52.834
If it means you'll stop

20:49.959 --> 20:52.834
whining about it, then fine.

20:52.875 --> 20:55.250
I hope you brought

20:52.875 --> 20:55.250
your Phase Tech, Frankie.

20:55.291 --> 20:57.375
Objection. Last time,

20:55.291 --> 20:57.375
that device gave you

20:57.417 --> 20:58.667
an unfair advantage.

20:58.709 --> 21:02.041
On three. One, two...

21:05.542 --> 21:07.959
What?

21:05.542 --> 21:07.959
Everything you just said,

21:08.000 --> 21:09.250
those are memories.

21:10.291 --> 21:12.208
I guess it just took longer.

21:12.250 --> 21:15.333
Yeah!

21:12.250 --> 21:15.333
( whistling, cheering )

21:15.375 --> 21:17.000
I remember.

21:17.041 --> 21:18.917
You're a glory hog, too.

21:18.959 --> 21:21.250
Who, me?

21:18.959 --> 21:21.250
Ha, ha, ha!

21:22.500 --> 21:25.166
Heh, heh!

21:22.500 --> 21:25.166
Hey, no cheating!

21:25.208 --> 21:29.417
First rule of Rescue Ball,

21:25.208 --> 21:29.417
there are no rules! Ha, ha!

21:29.458 --> 21:30.709
( grunts )

21:32.041 --> 21:34.250
(  dramatic theme playing  )
