AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE
AFRAID TO TALK ABOUT THAT.

13:40.133 --> 13:43.067
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I'D TALK ABOUT ME,

13:43.067 --> 13:44.600
BECAUSE THE BOOK IS FICTION.

13:44.633 --> 13:47.667
I UNDERSTAND THAT,
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, JENNY,

13:47.700 --> 13:49.367
PEOPLE AREN'T BUYING
LITERARY FICTION

13:49.400 --> 13:50.600
THE WAY THEY USED TO.

13:50.633 --> 13:52.367
IN TODAY'S CLIMATE,

13:52.400 --> 13:54.233
SURVIVOR MEMOIRS
HAVE A MUCH BETTER CHANCE

13:54.267 --> 13:55.667
OF BREAKING OUT
AND REACHING AN AUDIENCE--

13:55.700 --> 13:58.300
JENNY, OKAY, CUT IT,
PRINT IT, MOVING ON.

HI. OH, UH, BILLIE...

14:14.367 --> 14:16.867

14:16.900 --> 14:18.633
YES, SEE, WE'RE NOT EVEN

14:18.667 --> 14:19.600

BUT HOW MUCH OF THE CONTENT
WOULD I HAVE TO CHANGE?

14:28.567 --> 14:30.200
NOT ALL
THAT MUCH.

14:30.233 --> 14:31.767

14:33.467 --> 14:34.967
OH, MY GOD, WOW.

14:35.067 --> 14:36.867
JENNY, YOU'VE WRITTEN
A WONDERFUL BOOK,

14:36.900 --> 14:39.267

14:45.067 --> 14:47.333
THE FIRST HALF OF YOUR ADVANCE.

14:47.367 --> 14:49.333
TAKE A LOOK.

14:58.067 --> 15:00.633

15:11.167 --> 15:12.900
OH, MY GOD, I'M SO HAPPY!

15:14.967 --> 15:16.867
MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE
THAT TRIP TO PARIS

15:16.900 --> 15:17.867

15:43.867 --> 15:44.867
WE'VE NEVER
HAD A PROBLEM.

IT'S JUST FOR SAFETY.

15:48.900 --> 15:51.233
OKAY?

16:38.267 --> 16:40.700
ARE YOU IN LOVE WITH HER?

16:42.067 --> 16:44.333

16:46.300 --> 16:47.800
ARE YOU SURE?

16:49.167 --> 16:51.133
YEAH.

16:56.233 --> 16:58.567
PLEASE, CARMEN, I DON'T WANT
TO MAKE THIS INTO A BIG DEAL.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.200
YOU GO ALL THE WAY
OVER TO SOMEBODY'S BEACH HOUSE,

17:00.233 --> 17:01.333
AND YOU FUCK THEM

17:01.367 --> 17:02.367
AND YOU'RE ASKING ME
NOT TO MAKE IT

17:02.400 --> 17:04.100
INTO A BIG
FUCKING DEAL!

17:04.133 --> 17:05.367

17:08.233 --> 17:09.267
DON'T YOU START.
YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE--

17:09.300 --> 17:10.267
THAT WAS WORK,
AND YOU KNOW IT!

17:14.967 --> 17:16.067
ARE YOU JEALOUS?

17:16.067 --> 17:17.800
NO.

17:17.833 --> 17:20.267
I'M NOT FUCKING JEALOUS.

17:22.267 --> 17:23.700
IT JUST MADE ME SAD.

17:23.733 --> 17:25.200
OH, YOU WERE
SO FUCKING SAD

THAT YOU GO OFF
AND YOU FUCK CHERIE JAFFE?

17:28.567 --> 17:31.233
SHANE, WHAT KIND OF
A PSYCHOTIC RESPONSE IS THAT?

17:33.267 --> 17:35.733
WELL, I GUESS I'M REALLY
FUCKED UP IN THAT WAY.

18:21.067 --> 18:22.233
THE SEX WAS
FUCKING MEANINGLESS?

18:22.267 --> 18:24.267
YOU KNOW WHAT,
SOMETIMES IT IS.

18:26.067 --> 18:28.067
IN THAT CASE,

18:55.300 --> 18:57.100
IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU WANT TO DO.

18:57.133 --> 19:00.300
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT.

19:00.333 --> 19:03.733
WELL, YOU NEED
TO FIGURE IT OUT,

19:03.767 --> 19:06.067
AND YOU NEED TO KNOW
THAT I CAN'T PROMISE

19:06.067 --> 19:11.167
THAT I'LL STILL BE HERE
ONCE YOU'VE GOT YOUR ANSWERS.

19:19.167 --> 19:20.200

THAT'S GREAT,
BECAUSE I LOVE BIRDS.

I DON'T UNDERSTAND,

NO.
I SHOULDN'T DO IT.

24:38.600 --> 24:39.933
AL...

24:39.967 --> 24:41.367
AND DO MY EYES LOOK
A LITTLE BLACK?

24:41.400 --> 24:43.067
I'M SERIOUS.

24:43.067 --> 24:45.100
NO, COME ON, AL,
YOU GOT EMBRACED.

24:45.133 --> 24:47.200
I SURE DID.

24:47.233 --> 24:49.933
NO, IT'S CALLED
A VAMPIRE'S EMBRACE.

24:49.967 --> 24:51.467
THERE'S, LIKE,
THESE LESBIAN

24:51.500 --> 24:53.633
VAMPIRE GOTH CULTS.

24:53.667 --> 24:55.400
SO WHAT THEY DO
IS THEY PICK A VICTIM,

24:55.433 --> 24:58.267
THEY, LIKE, TAKE THEM HOME,
SEDUCE THEM, FUCK THEM BLIND--

24:58.300 --> 25:01.067
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW.

25:01.100 --> 25:03.267
AND THEN THEY
BITE YOUR NECK.

25:03.300 --> 25:04.600
IT WAS THE BEST SEX
I'VE EVER HAD

25:04.633 --> 25:06.400
IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

25:06.433 --> 25:08.767
I CAME, LIKE, 9,000 TIMES.

25:10.233 --> 25:12.233

25:15.533 --> 25:17.933
THAT'S FANTASTIC, ALICE.

25:17.967 --> 25:19.367

25:28.800 --> 25:31.867
SO, UM, I'M GOING TO GO

25:38.533 --> 25:41.733
ONLY IF YOU MANAGE
TO CLEAN UP YOUR ACT BY THEN.

25:42.700 --> 25:44.067
YEAH, SHANE,

25:44.067 --> 25:45.200
YOU REALLY
SHOULD QUIT SMOKING.

25:45.233 --> 25:46.833
MM-HMM.
IT'S GROSS.

25:56.867 --> 25:58.500
LOOK, AS MUCH
AS WE WANT TO BE

25:58.533 --> 26:00.433
IN BUSINESS WITH YOU,

26:00.467 --> 26:01.467
DYLAN'S NOT PREPARED
TO GIVE UP HER FINAL CUT.

26:01.500 --> 26:02.233
THIS IS HER BABY, RIGHT?

26:02.267 --> 26:03.467
I'M SORRY,

26:03.500 --> 26:04.100
BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
THAT WE WOULD--

26:04.133 --> 26:05.333
IT'S FINE.

26:05.367 --> 26:07.233
WE WOULDN'T DREAM
OF TAKING AWAY

26:28.567 --> 26:30.433

26:37.900 --> 26:44.633
AND I CAN'T SAY
THAT IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

26:44.667 --> 26:48.067

I WANT TO MAKE THAT...

27:07.367 --> 27:10.867
I WANT TO MAKE THAT PROMISE TO.

27:30.533 --> 27:32.433
[CRYING]

27:32.467 --> 27:34.533
I'M SORRY.

27:36.767 --> 27:39.400
I'M SORRY.

27:42.333 --> 27:43.467
I THINK THE PAPERWORK

27:43.500 --> 27:45.100
SHOULD PROBABLY TAKE
ABOUT A WEEK.

27:45.133 --> 27:46.200
OKAY.
THAT'S WHAT
I'M THINKING.

27:46.233 --> 27:49.400
OH, MY JACKET.
SORRY.

27:49.433 --> 27:51.300
UM, I'LL CATCH YOU UP.

27:51.333 --> 27:52.700
OKAY.

27:58.600 --> 28:00.867
I--I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

28:00.900 --> 28:03.100
OKAY.

28:03.133 --> 28:04.233
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

28:04.267 --> 28:06.467
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE...

28:06.500 --> 28:08.600
LIKE WE DON'T EVEN
KNOW EACH OTHER.

28:10.067 --> 28:12.800
WE DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER,
HELENA.

28:12.833 --> 28:14.967
REALLY?

28:16.733 --> 28:19.200
I--I GOT CAUGHT UP IN THE WORK,

28:19.233 --> 28:20.633
AND WHAT--
WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT--

28:20.667 --> 28:22.700
I GET REALLY OPEN
AND VULNERABLE

28:22.733 --> 28:24.433
WHEN I'M TALKING
ABOUT MY WORK,

28:24.467 --> 28:26.900
BUT NOTHING LIKE THAT HAS EVER
HAPPENED TO ME BEFORE.

28:26.933 --> 28:29.700
NOTHING LIKE THAT HAS EVER
HAPPENED TO ME BEFORE EITHER.

28:29.733 --> 28:31.300
WELL, YOU'RE GAY.

28:31.333 --> 28:34.533
WELL, NOTHING THAT INTENSE.

28:34.567 --> 28:37.733
LOOK, I'M--
I'M STRAIGHT, HELENA,

28:37.767 --> 28:40.367
AND I'M WITH DANNY,

28:40.400 --> 28:41.767
AND MAYBE THAT MAKES YOU

28:41.800 --> 28:43.567
NOT WANT TO SUPPORT ME
AND MY PROJECT--

28:43.600 --> 28:45.067
NO, IT...

28:45.067 --> 28:49.333
IT DOESN'T AFFECT MY DECISION.

28:49.367 --> 28:51.700
YOU SURE?

28:51.733 --> 28:54.200
BECAUSE IT'S NEVER GOING
TO HAPPEN AGAIN.

28:56.400 --> 28:58.533
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

29:01.333 --> 29:02.800
OKAY...

29:14.167 --> 29:15.433
SHE'S IN RECOVERY.

29:15.467 --> 29:16.767
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

29:16.800 --> 29:18.300
WELL, I'M AFRAID

29:18.333 --> 29:20.800
I CAN'T SHARE
THAT INFORMATION WITH YOU.

29:22.733 --> 29:24.500
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WHY NOT?

29:24.533 --> 29:26.167
BECAUSE, TECHNICALLY,
YOU'RE NOT DANA'S FAMILY.

29:26.200 --> 29:29.433
I'M HER PARTNER.

29:29.467 --> 29:31.267
SHE TOLD YOU THAT.

29:31.300 --> 29:32.833
UNFORTUNATELY,
I'M ONLY LEGALLY ALLOWED

29:32.867 --> 29:36.300
TO RELEASE MEDICAL INFORMATION
TO FAMILY.

29:37.633 --> 29:40.100
DO YOU KNOW HOW TO REACH
DANA'S PARENTS?

29:47.500 --> 29:48.833
SURE.

29:48.867 --> 29:50.567
YEAH, YEAH.

29:50.600 --> 29:52.767
NO, NO, WE'LL HAVE DINNER,

THE WHOLE TRUTH.

30:34.833 --> 30:36.400
I MEAN, WE KNEW
THAT SHE WAS COMING IN

30:36.433 --> 30:38.433

31:08.933 --> 31:10.400
DID ALICE CALL YOU GUYS?

31:10.433 --> 31:12.067
I ASKED HER TO CALL YOU.

31:12.067 --> 31:14.200
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO
GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU.

31:14.233 --> 31:16.867
DR. SHAPIRO, THESE ARE
DANA'S PARENTS.

31:16.900 --> 31:20.067

AS THEY CALLED.

31:52.800 --> 31:54.733
WHERE'S LARA?

31:56.967 --> 31:58.533
SHE WENT HOME.

WHAT'S GOING ON?

32:12.767 --> 32:14.667
DANA, IT WAS
MUCH MORE PROGRESSED

32:14.700 --> 32:17.833
THAN WE ANTICIPATED.

32:17.867 --> 32:20.400
THE CANCER HAS METASTASIZED
TO THE LYMPH NODES.

32:20.433 --> 32:22.533

33:37.067 --> 33:39.700

THE WRONG PERSON.

33:39.733 --> 33:42.233
I WAS STRAIGHT
UNTIL I MET BETTE.

33:42.267 --> 33:46.100
WELL, THEN, TALK TO ME
AS A STRAIGHT WOMAN.

33:46.133 --> 33:47.300
WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND

33:47.333 --> 33:48.433
WHEN YOU FIRST HAD
THOSE FEELINGS?

33:48.467 --> 33:49.967
IT WAS TERRIFYING.

33:50.067 --> 33:52.733
I MEAN, THE FALLING IN LOVE PART
FEELS GOOD,

33:52.767 --> 33:54.633
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH
TO WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND.

33:54.667 --> 33:55.733
BUT WHY?

33:55.767 --> 33:58.767
I MEAN, ISN'T LOVE JUST LOVE?

33:58.800 --> 34:00.633
NO, IT ISN'T.

UNDERSTAND, YOU KNOW.
