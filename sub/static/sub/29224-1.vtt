Welcome to season three
of <i> 13 Reasons Why.</i>

00:08.550 --> 00:09.759
If you've been watching,

00:09.843 --> 00:13.346
you know our show portrays a number
of real issues facing teenagers today.

00:13.430 --> 00:15.807
We tell stories about things
like substance abuse,

00:15.890 --> 00:19.102
bullying, sexual assault,
violence and suicide.

00:19.185 --> 00:22.981
If these issues are in your life,
this series may not be right for you.

00:23.064 --> 00:24.983
Or you may not want to watch it alone.

00:25.066 --> 00:27.694
So, watch with your parents,
your family or your friends.

00:27.777 --> 00:29.612
Then talk to someone about what you see...

00:29.696 --> 00:31.740
What you think about it.
How it makes you feel.

00:31.990 --> 00:33.533
And if you find you need help,

00:33.742 --> 00:35.076
talk to a trusted adult.

00:35.368 --> 00:36.619
Like a school counselor.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.246
Or call a local helpline

00:38.329 --> 00:41.166
or visit our website
at 13ReasonsWhy.info.

00:41.541 --> 00:44.294
Once you start talking about it,
it gets better.

00:44.961 --> 00:45.795
Enjoy the show.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.088
Enjoy the conversation.

00:47.172 --> 00:48.631
And take care of each other.

[Ani] Right, I'm off then.

02:16.344 --> 02:17.344
[Ani's mum] Wait...

02:18.888 --> 02:20.140
This is fashion?

02:20.223 --> 02:23.101
It is quite stylish, yes. Thank you.

02:23.434 --> 02:26.271
- The things that school allows.
- You don't even know.

02:27.147 --> 02:30.316
I didn't see you all weekend.
I had both days off.

02:31.109 --> 02:33.027
I had projects.

02:33.695 --> 02:36.281
Next Sunday, I'll go to church with you.

02:36.364 --> 02:37.824
- Yes?
- At the very least.

about...

- Tyler?
- Do you think so?

05:53.519 --> 05:55.719
- Did you tell them?
- [scoffs] Are you fucking serious?

05:55.772 --> 05:57.932
- No, of course I didn't tell them.
- Really? 'Cause...

05:57.982 --> 06:00.151
you've been pretty hostile
to everyone lately.

06:00.234 --> 06:02.278
No, I've been pretty hostile
to you lately.

06:02.945 --> 06:05.049
Plus this whole Tyler thing happened
seven months ago.

06:05.073 --> 06:07.784
- Why would I say anything now?
- Why else would they want Clay?

06:08.534 --> 06:11.204
- How would I know?
- Did something happen this weekend?

06:11.746 --> 06:13.873
What did you do
after the homecoming game?

Not my first time on crutches, Alex.

- C'mon, Zach, give me a win.
- [Jess] Alex?

The cops were just here.

06:44.153 --> 06:46.030
- They took Clay in.
- Okay.

06:46.197 --> 06:47.740
- Okay?
- Yeah. I mean,

06:47.824 --> 06:49.617
Clay's not gonna say anything
about anybody.

06:49.700 --> 06:51.411
- Jess, come on.
- I have to go.

06:53.913 --> 06:56.749
What's up with her? Hasn't it been
a few months since you guys...

06:56.833 --> 07:00.586
Yeah, I guess it's a quick slide
from "we can be friends"

07:00.670 --> 07:02.130
to "don't fucking touch me."

07:03.423 --> 07:05.299
Your knee seems worse today.

07:05.716 --> 07:08.928
Friday night you could put some weight
on it, right? Without the crutches?

07:09.053 --> 07:10.596
Yeah. I mean...

07:11.305 --> 07:12.723
that's how these things go.

It swells up.

You can't go down there.
It's not a good idea for you. I'll go.

07:47.884 --> 07:49.552
You go down there. That's a better idea.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.905
- What about the guns?
- That's dealt with. You know that.

07:51.929 --> 07:54.265
No, all I know is you and Clay said
you took care of it.

07:54.348 --> 07:55.683

how we got here.</i>

08:10.865 --> 08:12.033

I don't even think they looked
as I drove by.

08:15.745 --> 08:18.206
Yeah, Justin and those guys
are gonna talk to the police.

08:18.289 --> 08:19.415
We got a story.

08:19.540 --> 08:22.752
We didn't take it as real.
It's just him, you know?

08:22.835 --> 08:25.421
I heard him talking about it
and I jumped to conclusions.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.548
- It was a total joke, all right?
- [man] Yeah?

08:27.632 --> 08:29.467
It was fucking stupid
but it was a total joke.

08:29.550 --> 08:31.030
- [Standall] You made a joke?
- I did.

08:36.307 --> 08:37.975
[Tony] Tyler? How you doing?

08:39.434 --> 08:42.145
Just breathe, man.
Everything's going to be okay.

[police sirens]

08:44.482 --> 08:48.528
Wait, they're... They're not coming here.
They're going to the school.

08:49.362 --> 08:52.156
But we need you
to get out of the backpack

08:52.240 --> 08:53.241
and the belt.

08:54.951 --> 08:58.079
I need you to be here... with me.

09:00.122 --> 09:01.916
- No, don't touch me!
- Okay!

09:01.999 --> 09:05.419
- Don't fucking touch me!
- Okay, Tyler! I'm not.

09:06.045 --> 09:07.588
I'm over here. You're good.

09:08.130 --> 09:09.970
But I'm gonna need you
to take off the backpack

09:10.049 --> 09:11.175
and take off the belt

09:11.259 --> 09:12.677
and walk away from them.

09:27.316 --> 09:28.396
[Tony] Now walk towards me.

09:32.029 --> 09:33.072
It's just Clay.

09:33.823 --> 09:34.949
It's just Clay, see?

09:35.074 --> 09:37.660
I told you we were going to meet up
with him in the car.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.579
Right. Okay.

09:48.296 --> 09:49.296
[Clay] Hey, Tyler.

09:49.839 --> 09:50.840
How you doing?

09:51.424 --> 09:52.883
Shall we get you home?

09:56.345 --> 09:57.345
[Tyler] Oh, my God...

09:58.014 --> 09:59.014
My parents...

10:00.349 --> 10:01.349
Tyler...

10:02.727 --> 10:03.769
[Clay] What did you do?

10:04.895 --> 10:07.523
[Ani] <i>I don't know everything
that's happened since that night,</i>

10:08.858 --> 10:11.736
<i>but I know it was Bryce Walker's
last night at Liberty.</i>

10:13.613 --> 10:15.114
<i>And I'm the new kid, right?</i>

10:16.240 --> 10:18.200
<i>I watch. I listen.</i>

10:19.368 --> 10:20.620
<i>I know quite a bit.</i>

10:23.414 --> 10:25.166
<i>And I'll tell you everything.</i>

10:28.919 --> 10:29.962
Do I need a lawyer?

10:31.005 --> 10:32.715
[laughs] Oh... No.

10:34.550 --> 10:37.053
No, this isn't any kind
of criminal investigation.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.388
And you're over 18 now, right?

10:41.515 --> 10:42.558
As of last month.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.602
Yeah, so you don't even
need a parent here.

10:45.144 --> 10:47.438
I mean, feel free to call your mom
if you want.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.315
No. Thank you.

10:49.940 --> 10:51.420
So, how are things at Liberty lately?

10:52.443 --> 10:53.527
Fine, I guess.

10:53.611 --> 10:56.656
Pretty stressful though, I imagine,
with everything that's going on.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.867
Hannah's trial, then Bryce.

11:00.368 --> 11:02.620
Then the false alarm
at the dance last spring,

11:02.703 --> 11:04.205
now all this at Homecoming.

11:04.997 --> 11:06.957
More than any one high school deserves.

11:07.041 --> 11:09.710
I think a lot of high schools
go through a lot worse.

11:09.794 --> 11:12.088
You're right.
But this thing with Homecoming...

11:13.047 --> 11:14.047
were you there?

11:14.465 --> 11:16.050
At the game Friday night?

11:16.425 --> 11:17.425
I was.

11:17.468 --> 11:18.719
Did you get caught up in it?

11:19.303 --> 11:21.263
Not so much. A little.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.182
Did you run into Bryce Walker?

11:23.849 --> 11:25.059
We said hello.

11:25.142 --> 11:27.436
Okay. Was this before the game or after?

11:27.812 --> 11:28.812
Before.

11:30.564 --> 11:31.564
Why?

11:32.525 --> 11:33.359
Well...

11:33.526 --> 11:34.527
[sighing]

11:35.152 --> 11:37.530
See, the thing is, Clay...

11:39.448 --> 11:41.826
Bryce was playing for Hillcrest
on Friday night.

11:42.410 --> 11:45.079
He walked off the field
and hasn't been seen since.

11:48.124 --> 11:51.293
Do you have any idea where he could be
or who he could be with?

11:57.049 --> 11:58.050
[stammers] I don't.

11:59.385 --> 12:00.385
Hmm.

12:03.389 --> 12:04.682
Except for...

12:07.101 --> 12:08.269
we found this...

12:09.103 --> 12:10.604
inside Bryce's room.

12:11.188 --> 12:12.481
You recognize that?

12:15.901 --> 12:17.987
- [stammers] It used to be mine.
- You have any idea

12:18.070 --> 12:20.740
how Bryce could come to have it
or why would it be in his room?

12:21.824 --> 12:22.658
I don't know.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.369
When's the last time you saw it
or had it in your possession?

12:27.329 --> 12:30.374
[stammers] I don't remember.
I don't ride a bike anymore.

12:30.458 --> 12:31.458
Okay.

12:32.877 --> 12:33.877
Um...

12:34.587 --> 12:36.756
Clay, you were seen
outside of Bryce's house

12:36.839 --> 12:38.758
a few days before the homecoming game.

12:39.884 --> 12:42.636
You apparently threatened him.

12:47.683 --> 12:49.018
Specifically you said,

12:49.643 --> 12:50.853
"I'll fucking kill you."

12:52.062 --> 12:53.189
Can you explain that?

12:55.900 --> 12:56.817
Who told you that?

12:56.901 --> 12:59.028
It's not important.
Do you remember saying that?

12:59.945 --> 13:02.990
I was... I was checking on a friend,

13:03.616 --> 13:04.658
their safety.

13:04.742 --> 13:07.203
I mean, Bryce has a history.

13:10.498 --> 13:12.738
- [male teacher]...a triangle...
- [cell phone vibrating]

13:13.042 --> 13:14.919
...by repeatedly removing

13:15.002 --> 13:17.963
the middle triangle
from each of the prior generations,

13:18.506 --> 13:21.425
the number of colored triangles increases

13:21.509 --> 13:22.843
by a factor of...?

13:23.928 --> 13:27.264
Triangle recursion by a factor of three.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.058
- Mr. Wood?
- [Mr. Wood] Yes?

13:29.308 --> 13:32.603
Would it be possible for me to run
to the robotics room for a few?

13:32.686 --> 13:35.564
I've just realized
I've left a battery overcharging

13:35.648 --> 13:37.441
and it's going to fry the motherboard.

13:37.525 --> 13:40.361
Not a problem. I doubt
you need this review in the first place.

13:40.444 --> 13:43.113
Well, I wasn't going to say anything,
but thank you.

13:46.450 --> 13:48.828
Is there anything else
you think I should know?

13:51.247 --> 13:52.248
No.

13:52.331 --> 13:53.331
[knock on door]

13:58.170 --> 14:00.422
All right.
I got to go check on a few things.

14:01.215 --> 14:02.675
Be back in a couple of minutes.

14:02.758 --> 14:04.426
Feel free to use your cell phone.

14:09.014 --> 14:10.014
[door closing]

14:37.918 --> 14:39.545
Clay, my name is Nora Walker.

14:41.046 --> 14:43.007
Yes, I know... I know who you are.

14:51.098 --> 14:52.182
[sighing]

14:52.725 --> 14:56.353
Clay, I know Bryce hurt you
and friends of yours.

14:57.354 --> 14:59.189
He's done some monstrous things.

15:02.192 --> 15:03.235
But he's my son.

15:04.528 --> 15:08.073
I don't excuse anything that he's done,

15:08.657 --> 15:09.783
but he's my child.

15:11.827 --> 15:13.037
And he might be lost.

15:14.747 --> 15:15.747
He might be hurt.

15:18.167 --> 15:19.627
Do you know anything

15:20.669 --> 15:22.338
that might help us find him?

15:25.174 --> 15:26.425
I don't, Mrs. Walker.

15:28.761 --> 15:29.762
I'm sorry.

15:34.308 --> 15:35.559
[Ani] <i>Though to tell the truth,</i>

15:36.018 --> 15:38.312
<i>I don't really know Clay Jensen
all that well.</i>

15:39.104 --> 15:40.105
<i>He was a classmate.</i>

15:40.189 --> 15:41.589
Why am I not surprised you're here?

15:41.857 --> 15:43.025
Was it about Tyler?

15:43.525 --> 15:44.525
Not here.

15:45.152 --> 15:47.279
[Ani] <i> Do I think he's capable
of being violent?</i>

15:47.738 --> 15:50.574
<i>I don't know. Do any of us really know
what we're capable of?</i>

15:50.658 --> 15:52.698
I have to tell the group text
it wasn't about Tyler.

15:52.743 --> 15:53.911
As I'm not on that group,

15:53.994 --> 15:56.434
are you gonna send me a separate text
as to what it was about,

15:56.497 --> 15:58.207
or should I ask Justin or someone?

15:59.500 --> 16:00.960
You're telling me you don't know?

16:01.752 --> 16:05.005
Bryce is missing. He hasn't been seen
since Homecoming Friday night.

16:05.089 --> 16:06.465
It didn't come up at home?

16:06.882 --> 16:08.258
Well, my mum had the weekend off

16:08.342 --> 16:10.302
and I made myself scarce,
as you might expect.

16:11.345 --> 16:13.055
They think something happened to him,

16:13.138 --> 16:16.016
that someone did something to him,
and they think the someone is me.

16:16.558 --> 16:18.227
- Sweet Jesus.
- Yeah.

16:19.103 --> 16:20.103
Prayers welcome.

16:21.105 --> 16:23.482
[Ani] <i>Does Clay have influence
over his peers?</i>

16:25.025 --> 16:26.025
<i>I don't know.</i>

16:26.443 --> 16:28.404
<i>I mean, he's not like...</i>

16:29.571 --> 16:30.948
<i>the captain of the football team.</i>

16:31.031 --> 16:32.324
Come on, Charlie. Hustle.

16:32.408 --> 16:33.659
You got beat on Friday.

16:33.742 --> 16:36.870
Nah, you got beat on Friday!
I just sucked.

16:39.790 --> 16:40.791
You're late.

16:40.874 --> 16:42.710
- [Zach] With the DBs, other end zone.
- Okay.

16:42.793 --> 16:43.794
[Zach] Where were you?

16:45.212 --> 16:46.463
Were you with Clay?

16:46.714 --> 16:48.007
I went to tell Tony.

16:48.716 --> 16:49.800
Ani went to the station.

16:49.883 --> 16:51.885
She thought it'd be best
if we just stay away.

16:52.553 --> 16:53.679
We're fucked, right?

16:55.014 --> 16:56.014
We're fucked.

16:56.306 --> 16:58.017
We're not fucked
if he didn't say anything.

16:58.350 --> 16:59.350
[cell phone vibrating]

17:04.940 --> 17:06.650
[coach] Keep it up, guys. Let's go!

17:07.276 --> 17:08.276
Jesus!

17:09.694 --> 17:10.694
What?

17:11.696 --> 17:15.701
- Foley, what the fuck? Let's go.
- Hey, just... just hold on, okay?

17:16.201 --> 17:18.662
What's up with you two?
Your sex tape get leaked?

17:18.746 --> 17:19.746
Dude, Bryce...

17:21.205 --> 17:22.205
He's missing.

17:22.875 --> 17:23.875
So?

17:24.251 --> 17:25.085
So?

17:25.169 --> 17:28.213
Well, he'll be back.
His mom pays, like, zero attention.

17:28.297 --> 17:30.897
I'm sure he got drunk after Homecoming
and stayed drunk somewhere.

17:32.134 --> 17:33.802
Yeah. Could be.

17:34.470 --> 17:35.512
Now let's go, Foley.

17:35.596 --> 17:38.223
We're putting in a nickel package
against East Cali.

17:41.310 --> 17:42.790
[Ani] <i>And have you talked to Jessica?</i>

17:43.604 --> 17:45.481
<i>I mean, there's a whole story there.</i>

17:45.564 --> 17:46.774
All right, look.

17:46.857 --> 17:51.028
Given how destructive and public
the events at the homecoming game were,

17:51.612 --> 17:53.322
we're looking at
a multiple-day suspension.

17:54.531 --> 17:56.241
- Okay.
- And I understand that

17:56.325 --> 17:58.327
there are some very strong feelings here

17:58.410 --> 18:01.171
and you and your group have
an important voice that needs to be heard,

18:01.205 --> 18:02.623
and I want to be sensitive to that.

18:02.706 --> 18:04.458
But I also want to find a solution

18:04.541 --> 18:06.341
- that is positive, even...
- [cell vibrating]

18:07.127 --> 18:09.880
progressive, as well as remedial.

18:10.798 --> 18:12.549
- Oh, shit!
- I'm sorry?

18:13.509 --> 18:14.509
I mean...

18:16.470 --> 18:18.222
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, whatever.

18:18.305 --> 18:20.665
If I suspend you,
I have to suspend everybody in your group.

18:20.724 --> 18:23.185
Not to mention Clay Jensen
and Tyler Down.

18:23.268 --> 18:25.270
As well as the majority
of the football team:

18:25.854 --> 18:27.397
Zach Dempsey, Justin Foley,

18:27.481 --> 18:30.192
Charlie Saint-George,
Montgomery de la Cruz...

18:30.275 --> 18:32.653
Wouldn't that be a shame,
if Monty got suspended?

18:33.779 --> 18:36.115
We have damage to our stadium
and to our field.

18:36.448 --> 18:37.968
We had to cancel the homecoming dance.

18:38.033 --> 18:41.286
I have football players walking around
with black eyes and bloody faces

18:41.370 --> 18:44.410
- like they've been through the wars.
- Isn't that what football's all about?

18:44.456 --> 18:46.336
I have the Dean of Students
of Hillcrest calling

18:46.375 --> 18:48.168
threatening personal injury lawsuits.

18:48.252 --> 18:49.545
Well, they started it.

18:49.628 --> 18:51.755
Our students threw all the first punches.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.674
Yeah, but Hillcrest started it.

18:54.216 --> 18:55.509
You get that, right?

18:56.969 --> 19:00.681
This was about Bryce Walker, was it not?
The fact that he was on the field.

19:01.431 --> 19:03.892
- Bryce Walker had nothing to do with it.
- Yeah.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.871
Well, you and I both know that's not true.
Now, you listen to me, Jessica,

19:06.895 --> 19:09.398
you incited a riot
and there are consequences.

19:09.481 --> 19:11.567
You're the Student Body President,
for Christ's sake,

19:11.650 --> 19:13.152
you're supposed to be a role model!

19:14.278 --> 19:15.487
That's what I was being.

19:20.284 --> 19:22.494
[Clay] We're going to Monet's,
to talk about Bryce.

19:25.747 --> 19:27.291
- And?
- And...

19:29.126 --> 19:30.544
- we need you.
- Why?

19:31.628 --> 19:33.505
Well, we always need you.

19:34.882 --> 19:37.301
- Aren't you worried about it?
- Why would I be?

19:38.385 --> 19:42.222
Tyler, that's a thing I gotta worry about,
Bryce means nothing to me.

19:45.309 --> 19:46.935
Can you give us a ride to Monet's?

19:51.440 --> 19:54.151
[Ani] <i>Tony Padilla,
also a secret-keeper...</i>

19:55.777 --> 19:58.488
[Tony] I don't care about Bryce.
I hope he stays gone.

19:58.572 --> 20:01.158
[Clay] I don't think it's good
for either of us if he does.

20:02.159 --> 20:03.159
Any of us.

20:05.454 --> 20:06.496
What makes you say that?

20:07.748 --> 20:09.249
I mean, if they start digging.

20:10.459 --> 20:11.960
Spring Fling and everything.

20:14.421 --> 20:16.941
[Tony] Bryce Walker has been no part
of my life for a long time,

20:17.007 --> 20:18.717
and my life has been better for it.

20:19.635 --> 20:20.636
I'm at peace.

20:21.345 --> 20:22.638
[Ani] <i> Especially for Clay.</i>

20:25.599 --> 20:29.061
Okay, Tyler. We're gonna drive you home.
We're gonna go inside with you.

20:30.687 --> 20:32.522
Whatever happens, it's gonna...

20:33.941 --> 20:34.983
It's gonna be okay.

20:38.820 --> 20:39.947
I don't have my keys.

20:41.406 --> 20:42.406
Oh, right...

20:46.411 --> 20:47.411
Here.

20:59.633 --> 21:00.633
[gasps]

21:00.717 --> 21:02.970
Tyler! Oh, Tyler.

21:03.762 --> 21:04.802
[Tyler's mom] You're okay.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.307
Oh! We were so worried.

21:10.227 --> 21:11.307
What happened to your head?

21:12.479 --> 21:14.690
[stammers] He fell earlier.

21:17.025 --> 21:18.360
We got the text

21:18.443 --> 21:20.153
and then you weren't in your room.

21:20.237 --> 21:22.406
We didn't even know
you'd gone to the dance.

21:22.489 --> 21:25.951
- Sorry, Mrs. Down. There was a text?
- About the shooter.

21:26.034 --> 21:29.079
We got the text
that the dance was being evacuated.

21:29.663 --> 21:32.541
We couldn't find you.
Your father is down there now.

21:34.042 --> 21:37.212
Um, do your parents know that you're okay?

21:38.046 --> 21:40.382
- Yes.
- I should check in.

21:41.133 --> 21:45.095
Okay, well, they must want you home
but you're welcome to spend the night.

22:16.418 --> 22:17.627
If they'd have found this...

22:20.464 --> 22:21.464
Do we...

22:22.132 --> 22:23.132
tear it up?

22:40.609 --> 22:41.777
I just...

22:43.612 --> 22:45.739
I never thought I'd see my mom again.

22:52.788 --> 22:53.997
But why tonight?

22:55.624 --> 22:57.709
He just got back. I heard he was better.

22:59.169 --> 23:00.170
Did something happen?

23:00.879 --> 23:02.464
Where did the bruises come from?

23:06.802 --> 23:08.011
We have to get him help.

23:09.721 --> 23:11.223
But if anyone finds out why...

23:11.306 --> 23:12.474
Then we're all fucked.

23:17.938 --> 23:18.938
So...

23:20.732 --> 23:21.983
So we'll figure it out.

23:23.735 --> 23:25.779
We saved him, he's our responsibility.

23:32.327 --> 23:33.161
[swallows]

23:33.328 --> 23:34.329
Thanks for...

23:36.706 --> 23:38.291
getting into this with me.

23:40.043 --> 23:41.169
You're a good friend.

23:43.296 --> 23:44.840
It's my blessing and my curse.

23:46.383 --> 23:48.510
[Ani] <i>I don't really know
how far Clay would go...</i>

23:49.344 --> 23:50.554
<i>to protect a friend.</i>

23:51.096 --> 23:53.557
I went right up
to that little punk kid, Cyrus.

23:53.640 --> 23:56.184
I was sure he was the one who called.

23:56.935 --> 24:00.105
And I grabbed him and I started going off
and then,

24:00.188 --> 24:03.108
Zach, like, ran up and was like,

24:03.191 --> 24:06.820
"It was me. I called the cops.
Tyler should go to jail."

24:07.279 --> 24:10.073
And so I told him
if Tyler goes to jail now,

24:10.157 --> 24:12.617
so does Tony, and so does Clay,
at least.

24:12.701 --> 24:13.743
And that stopped him?

24:13.827 --> 24:15.907
That's when the cops
started coming through the front

24:15.954 --> 24:18.999
and they shut the music down and started
getting everyone on the ground.

24:19.082 --> 24:21.543
Me and Jess were right by Zach,
so I was like,

24:22.127 --> 24:23.378
"You get to decide now

24:23.837 --> 24:27.924
if you take down Clay and Tony,
and probably me and Jess with Tyler,

24:28.008 --> 24:30.168
- and fuck up this school even more,
- [cell vibrating]

24:31.011 --> 24:32.304
or if we get out of this."

24:32.721 --> 24:33.721
Well...

24:34.973 --> 24:35.973
everyone's coming.

24:36.850 --> 24:38.018
I'm buying.

24:43.273 --> 24:46.485
- It's really good to see you today.
- Oh, no. No!

24:47.068 --> 24:50.113
What happened last night
was a one-time thing

24:50.197 --> 24:52.324
and it's never happening again,
understand?

24:52.407 --> 24:55.076
Jess, shit... I'm sorry.

24:55.160 --> 24:56.745
I don't need your apology.

24:57.454 --> 24:59.789
And stop giving me
that fucking puppy dog eye look.

24:59.873 --> 25:01.793
It does not work on me
and it never actually did.

25:02.375 --> 25:04.961
- I'm sorry.
- If you apologize again, I will cut you.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.380
- [Alex] Why are you cutting him?
- Um...

25:08.298 --> 25:09.424
Because he's evil.

25:10.133 --> 25:11.510
- Good morning.
- Hey.

25:13.053 --> 25:15.388
- You look really cute.
- Do I? Thank you.

25:16.139 --> 25:19.601
[Justin] We went over to roll his car
into a parking place.

25:20.018 --> 25:22.771
We figured we could hide it
with other cars.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.148
But the keys were still in it...

25:25.857 --> 25:27.901
Tyler didn't plan on coming back to it.

25:28.485 --> 25:30.278
- So, I drove it away.
- [Cyrus] Jesus.

25:30.946 --> 25:31.947
That's balls.

25:32.322 --> 25:34.241
[Zach] It was fucking stupid,
going out there,

25:34.324 --> 25:38.495
stepping in front of a gun like that,
acting like a fucking hero or something.

25:38.578 --> 25:41.665
You called the cops.
I passed the cops on my way out.

25:41.915 --> 25:43.166
Think about that timing!

25:43.250 --> 25:46.253
If I hadn't done something,
kids would be dead!

25:46.336 --> 25:49.089
We don't know that.
All you did was give Tyler another chance.

25:49.172 --> 25:51.424
- Exactly.
- Another chance to do it again.

25:52.467 --> 25:53.885
What if no one stops him next time?

25:55.095 --> 25:56.680
We make sure there isn't a next time.

25:56.763 --> 25:58.223
That's insane, Clay!

25:58.848 --> 26:00.267
He needs serious help.

26:00.350 --> 26:01.393
We can get him help.

26:02.060 --> 26:05.146
But if we tell anyone what he did,
then he's expelled at least

26:05.564 --> 26:06.648
and probably in jail,

26:06.731 --> 26:08.316
and probably tried as an adult.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.235
So, he's in juvie until he's 21,

26:10.318 --> 26:12.755
and then they send him to prison
and then what happens to him?

26:12.779 --> 26:13.779
No...

26:14.322 --> 26:15.322
This is bullshit.

26:17.450 --> 26:18.994
- I'm out.
- Zach...

26:19.077 --> 26:20.620
I won't tell, I won't say anything,

26:20.704 --> 26:23.873
but it's just not my job
to take care of that psychopath.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.543
[Ani] <i>Clay and his friends...</i>

26:27.669 --> 26:28.837
<i>they kept it close.</i>

26:30.005 --> 26:31.715
<i>I wasn't really part of the group.</i>

26:43.727 --> 26:49.190
Dude, what the actual fuck? Do they really
think something happened to Bryce?

26:49.274 --> 26:50.900
I don't think they know.

26:52.193 --> 26:55.488
I mean, it's possible
he's just at some hotel in Vegas, right?

26:56.531 --> 26:57.574
I just, I...

26:58.825 --> 27:00.243
If they start looking into shit,

27:00.327 --> 27:04.080
between me and Bryce,
between <i>you,</i> me and Bryce,

27:04.164 --> 27:06.249
like that night at his house last spring.

27:06.499 --> 27:07.499
[manager] Justin,

27:08.043 --> 27:10.086
wanna maybe bus a few tables
while you're out there,

27:10.170 --> 27:12.839
- at least pretend you actually work here.
- Yeah, sorry.

27:16.217 --> 27:18.053
I gotta start my shift.

27:22.932 --> 27:24.934
What night at his house last spring?

27:25.018 --> 27:26.311
Does Justin seem...

27:27.312 --> 27:28.312
freaked out?

27:31.441 --> 27:32.441
Aren't you?

27:35.820 --> 27:39.866
You don't have to worry about me, okay?
I can take care of myself.

27:56.758 --> 27:57.759
Hey, Alex.

27:58.051 --> 28:00.136
- Hey, did anyone text you?
- No. Why?

28:00.220 --> 28:01.220
Oh, shit.

28:01.513 --> 28:04.391
Sorry, I forgot you weren't
on the chain. It wasn't about you.

28:05.392 --> 28:06.392
Um...

28:06.476 --> 28:07.644
What was it about then?

28:08.853 --> 28:10.730
I guess Bryce Walker is missing.

28:12.941 --> 28:13.942
What does that mean?

28:14.484 --> 28:16.444
It means no one's seen him
since Friday night.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.528
But, like, do they think
something happened to him?

28:19.155 --> 28:20.281
I mean, who knows?

28:21.074 --> 28:23.284
Look, Justin has work
and Clay is still downtown,

28:23.368 --> 28:25.954
- so Cyrus said he'd give you a ride home.
- Oh, okay.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.666
- Is that not okay?
- No, it's great.

28:29.999 --> 28:31.167
[stammers] I just...

28:33.044 --> 28:35.714
He's probably not happy about it, right?

28:36.881 --> 28:39.551
Look, my mom's coming to get me later.
Do you want to wait with me?

28:40.802 --> 28:43.346
- Would that be okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

28:43.722 --> 28:44.722
Out front at five.

28:45.265 --> 28:46.265
Okay.

29:06.619 --> 29:08.037
[zipping]

29:12.542 --> 29:15.044
[Ani] <i>When Bryce went missing, at first,</i>

29:15.128 --> 29:17.255
<i>we all figured he'd show up in time.</i>

29:18.131 --> 29:20.133
<i>We weren't really that worried about it.</i>

29:20.216 --> 29:21.885
I've missed the carriage house.

29:23.011 --> 29:25.054
Justin and I prefer "outhouse."

29:34.773 --> 29:36.983
Well, you two have done
some more decorating.

29:39.319 --> 29:40.319
We've not.

29:40.820 --> 29:42.447
Well, that wasn't there before.

29:42.947 --> 29:43.947
Or that.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.994
That's not decorating,
that's putting shit up.

29:48.077 --> 29:51.331
I apologize.
I should have used a more manly verb.

29:52.207 --> 29:53.207
I'm just saying.

29:53.750 --> 29:55.460
You are good at so many things,

29:55.543 --> 29:58.004
but one of your greatest gifts
is staying angry.

29:59.005 --> 30:00.005
I'm not angry with you.

30:00.298 --> 30:02.842
And self-awareness, not one of your gifts.

30:02.926 --> 30:06.304
I know myself just fine. I spend more time
in my own head than anywhere else.

30:06.387 --> 30:07.387
[scoffs] Breaking news!

30:11.726 --> 30:13.311
He's just gonna turn up, right?

30:14.479 --> 30:16.523
- Bryce?
- And what if he doesn't?

30:16.606 --> 30:18.900
And what if they find out
what happened at Homecoming?

30:18.983 --> 30:22.195
- So I lay low for a while.
- Clay, they arrested you.

30:22.278 --> 30:25.174
- Not yet, they just questioned me.
- Because they think you did something.

30:25.198 --> 30:27.742
- I didn't.
- Then shouldn't we find out who did?

30:27.826 --> 30:29.452
How did Bryce get my bike lock?

30:37.627 --> 30:38.627
[door opening]

30:39.629 --> 30:43.550
Day-old pastries,
I got us the Monday mother lode. Hey, Ani.

30:44.342 --> 30:45.218
[Justin groaning]

30:45.301 --> 30:47.720
[Justin] I have lemon bars, pound cake,

30:47.804 --> 30:50.306
scones so dry
they taste like you're eating a wall.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.392
- Oh, I love those.
- [Justin] Mmm.

30:53.101 --> 30:54.811
- I need some air.
- Clay...

30:59.065 --> 31:00.149
[whispering in Swahili]

31:09.617 --> 31:10.617
[door closing]

31:11.995 --> 31:13.635
Fucking hate when you guys speak African.

31:14.664 --> 31:18.710
Eh, you are aware that Africa is
an entire continent, yeah?

31:19.252 --> 31:22.130
- Yeah, I'm aware. Eat these.
- Hmm.

31:27.218 --> 31:28.218
[knock on door]

31:30.138 --> 31:31.306
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Dad.

31:31.681 --> 31:32.681
You got a minute?

31:33.266 --> 31:35.560
I want to talk to you
about some developments today.

31:35.643 --> 31:37.645
- Yeah.
- So... [sighing]

31:38.479 --> 31:39.479
Bryce Walker's missing.

31:39.522 --> 31:42.609
He hasn't been seen since
after the homecoming game Friday night.

31:42.692 --> 31:43.692
Oh, wow.

31:44.319 --> 31:46.738
- And Clay Jensen already told you.
- Yeah.

31:47.572 --> 31:49.407
Right. So, have you heard anything?

31:50.825 --> 31:51.825
Heard from Bryce?

31:52.368 --> 31:55.371
No. I mean,
I saw him real quick at the game,

31:55.455 --> 31:57.455
- but that was before it even started.
- All right.

31:58.958 --> 32:01.198
Didn't you two spend some time together
this past summer?

32:01.252 --> 32:02.337
Oh, I mean...

32:03.254 --> 32:05.965
a little. Not really.
I mean, it was a while ago.

32:06.758 --> 32:09.093
All right. Well, you know,
if you hear anything.

32:09.260 --> 32:12.055
We're hoping this kid's just missing
but his window's closing fast.

32:12.138 --> 32:14.933
Yeah. I'll let you know, Dad.
If I hear anything.

32:15.016 --> 32:16.016
All right.

32:17.226 --> 32:18.226
Hmm.

32:23.274 --> 32:24.359
[sighs]

32:35.119 --> 32:36.204
[Ani] <i> Where was Bryce?</i>

32:38.539 --> 32:39.749
<i>Had something happened?</i>

32:45.546 --> 32:48.758
<i>Did it have anything to do
with the secrets Clay Jensen had kept</i>

32:48.841 --> 32:50.218
<i>since that day last spring?</i>

32:53.346 --> 32:54.722
Yeah, it was a whole thing.

32:55.056 --> 32:57.016
At least you're all safe.

32:57.308 --> 32:59.477
It sounds like it was an overreaction.

33:03.231 --> 33:04.565
Okay, here you go, Justin.

33:04.649 --> 33:07.276
- So, the social worker visits a few times.
- [message alert]

33:07.360 --> 33:09.112
They process the paperwork,

33:09.195 --> 33:13.157
then they'll schedule the custody hearing
once everything's been filed

33:13.241 --> 33:15.618
and they've confirmed
that they can't contact your mother.

33:16.828 --> 33:17.954
Okay. Got it.

33:19.372 --> 33:22.375
Hey, I think we should
clear out the workshop.

33:22.667 --> 33:24.627
- Turn it into a bedroom.
- For Justin?

33:25.169 --> 33:27.889
So we bring him into the house
then send him to a different building?

33:27.922 --> 33:30.425
For both boys.
They're going to be seniors next year.

33:30.508 --> 33:32.508
- They need their space.
- [Clay's mom] Apparently,

33:32.552 --> 33:33.672
they don't need their space,

33:33.720 --> 33:37.181
as they manage all kinds
of miscreant behavior without us knowing.

33:38.099 --> 33:39.099
Right, Clay?

33:40.685 --> 33:41.686
Clay?

33:44.105 --> 33:45.105
Uh, right.

33:46.899 --> 33:47.984
[message alert]

33:51.779 --> 33:53.072
- Good morning, Tony.
- Morning.

33:53.156 --> 33:55.825
- Thanks for giving Tyler a ride.
- It's my pleasure.

33:58.619 --> 34:00.705
- You have a good one, Mrs. Down.
- You too.

34:00.788 --> 34:01.788
Bye.

34:10.255 --> 34:11.799
It's not really your pleasure.

34:12.467 --> 34:13.467
To drive me.

34:13.801 --> 34:14.801
Yeah, it is.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.054
I help my friends.

34:18.389 --> 34:19.389
I'm not your friend.

34:20.099 --> 34:21.100
Yeah, you are.

34:21.559 --> 34:23.895
Well, you're Clay's friend, clearly, so...

34:25.646 --> 34:26.646
you're mine.

34:29.817 --> 34:31.860
You think everyone will keep it secret?

34:32.652 --> 34:33.652
I do.

34:34.989 --> 34:36.449
We're all in this together.

34:37.324 --> 34:38.451
Who called the police?

34:39.786 --> 34:40.786
We don't know.

34:55.885 --> 34:56.969
[Ani] <i> Even knowing nothing,</i>

34:58.096 --> 35:00.181
<i>I could tell Clay had a lot going on.</i>

35:01.516 --> 35:02.892
<i>A lot to take care of.</i>

35:03.434 --> 35:05.269
[Monty] Hey, Tyler. What's up?

35:12.985 --> 35:16.364
[stammering] I can't... I can't do this.
I've got to go.

35:16.447 --> 35:18.449
Fuck that guy. He's not gonna hurt you.

35:18.908 --> 35:20.785
No one's gonna push you around anymore.

35:21.994 --> 35:24.288
- I can't.
- Tyler, it's okay.

35:25.164 --> 35:27.625
[Tony] Okay. Tyler,
I need you to listen to me, okay?

35:27.708 --> 35:29.210
Focus on your breathing. Hey.

35:30.837 --> 35:32.296
Breathe as deep as you can.

35:32.964 --> 35:34.090
[exhales deeply]

35:36.134 --> 35:38.177
Look, you have first with Alex, right?

35:38.261 --> 35:41.556
Stick with Alex, he'll walk you to second.
Me and Justin will meet you at lunch.

35:42.390 --> 35:44.183
Okay. Okay.

35:55.111 --> 35:57.947
Something happened to that kid.
He's not right.

35:58.656 --> 35:59.699
You think Monty...

36:00.283 --> 36:04.328
Well, Monty, Bryce, Jamie Garrison,
the kid gets it from fucking everywhere.

36:05.413 --> 36:06.914
There's no way this is gonna work.

36:09.041 --> 36:11.752
- It has to.
- Are you guys sure you got all his guns?

36:14.297 --> 36:17.216
[Ani] <i>The whole school was wired, on edge.</i>

36:17.300 --> 36:20.887
There will be an active shooter drill
some time in the next two weeks.

36:20.970 --> 36:22.805
We will not be told in advance.

36:23.055 --> 36:26.767
We don't want to add to anyone's anxiety
after Saturday's false alarm.

36:29.520 --> 36:30.520
Clay Jensen,

36:31.189 --> 36:32.273
Principal Bolan.

36:43.409 --> 36:46.078
- Hey, Clay.
- Hey, Courtney.

36:46.370 --> 36:49.016
- Sorry to pull you out of class.
- I thought it was Principal Bolan.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.792
I just used one of his slips.
It's our turn for the new student tour.

36:51.876 --> 36:53.961
I have an appointment
in the careers center

36:54.045 --> 36:56.881
and the Wellesley recruiter's
only here for a day. So, can you take it?

36:57.215 --> 36:58.591
Thank you! Thank you.

36:59.467 --> 37:01.427
Ani, it was nice to meet you.

37:01.510 --> 37:03.638
- You too. Bye.
- Goodbye. Thank you.

37:05.514 --> 37:06.933
You gotta be fucking kidding me?

37:08.309 --> 37:10.269
I don't really need a tour.

37:11.938 --> 37:13.689
[Clay] This is the trophy case.

37:13.773 --> 37:17.568
And we actually have many more
academic decathlon and robotics trophies,

37:17.652 --> 37:19.612
but they're kept
in the math and science wing,

37:19.695 --> 37:21.113
which is in a different building

37:21.572 --> 37:23.699
to keep the main student body
from being infected

37:23.783 --> 37:25.701
by something like actual knowledge.

37:25.785 --> 37:30.248
To your left is the classroom
of the ironically named Mr. Champion,

37:30.331 --> 37:33.417
who stares at girls' breasts
while he's talking to them.

37:33.501 --> 37:35.211
These are posters for the drama club.

37:35.294 --> 37:38.047
We actually have
the most low-key drama club anywhere.

37:38.130 --> 37:40.258
They're totally not annoying people
at all.

37:40.800 --> 37:43.177
The drawback being
their plays are super boring, but

37:43.552 --> 37:44.720
really nice people

37:44.804 --> 37:46.264
Library's out that way.

37:46.722 --> 37:48.182
It's a pretty typical library

37:48.266 --> 37:51.227
as high school libraries go,
which means underfunded

37:51.310 --> 37:54.272
and thoroughly devoid of any book
that could be remotely controversial.

37:54.355 --> 37:57.316
This is my locker,
which I sometimes use

37:57.400 --> 37:59.193
to stick my head into and scream.

37:59.902 --> 38:02.613
What the fuck?
Hey, leave him the fuck alone!

38:02.697 --> 38:05.491
Hey, I need you to step off
and leave him alone, got it?

38:05.908 --> 38:06.909
Dude, that's my brother.

38:07.994 --> 38:09.161
Oh. Um...

38:09.829 --> 38:12.498
Well, so the fuck what?
You should still leave him alone.

38:12.581 --> 38:14.181
Brothers should take care of each other.

38:18.921 --> 38:21.132
I told him no coffee before the tour,
but...

38:22.383 --> 38:26.971
They call this the back quad,
even though there's no front quad

38:27.054 --> 38:29.223
and back quad sounds like "backwad,"

38:29.307 --> 38:31.309
which sounds either like a wedgie

38:31.392 --> 38:34.103
or a roll of fat that shows
when your shirt rides up.

38:34.895 --> 38:36.939
Football and soccer field down there,

38:37.398 --> 38:38.899
baseball field out there.

38:39.608 --> 38:41.610
Clearly the nicest parts of the school,

38:41.694 --> 38:45.656
because athletes are our heroes
and deserving of everything they want,

38:45.740 --> 38:47.742
including the ability
to sexually assault girls

38:47.825 --> 38:51.037
and never suffer any sort of consequences,
because why should they?

38:53.956 --> 38:54.956
Um...

38:55.416 --> 38:56.416
Sorry.

38:58.169 --> 39:01.255
Cafeteria over there. I bring my lunch.

39:01.797 --> 39:03.966
That's not a commentary
on the cafeteria food,

39:04.050 --> 39:06.761
that's just a nugget from my life.

39:08.220 --> 39:09.305
Wow.

39:09.513 --> 39:12.850
I've been to, like, five high schools
in three years,

39:13.642 --> 39:16.854
and that is by far the worst tour
I've ever been given.

39:17.229 --> 39:18.481
The absolute worst.

39:20.316 --> 39:21.776
[sighs] I'm sorry.

39:22.818 --> 39:24.570
It's kind of a weird time here.

39:25.863 --> 39:27.239
That's quite all right.

39:27.990 --> 39:30.034
It's also, like, my favorite tour ever.

39:31.786 --> 39:32.786
Well...

39:33.037 --> 39:34.037
thanks.

39:35.289 --> 39:36.332
[Ani] <i>He gave me a tour.</i>

39:37.124 --> 39:39.085
<i>Just a boring tour.</i>

39:41.837 --> 39:43.589
<i>I didn't really talk to him after.</i>

39:46.634 --> 39:49.303
Hey. You don't mind if I join, do you?

39:49.845 --> 39:51.806
I feel like you're obligated
to be nice to me,

39:51.889 --> 39:54.034
- at least for the rest of the day.
- Because you're new?

39:54.058 --> 39:56.977
Or because on my tour
you assaulted a guy.

39:59.105 --> 39:59.939
Ah...

40:00.022 --> 40:01.023
sure, have a seat.

40:03.025 --> 40:04.193
Hi. Ani.

40:05.486 --> 40:07.405
- Tyler.
- It's a pleasure, Tyler.

40:08.322 --> 40:09.657
So, tell me about Clay.

40:09.740 --> 40:12.493
He internalizes, doesn't he?

40:13.661 --> 40:14.745
Oh. I mean, I don't...

40:14.829 --> 40:17.331
You literally just met me.
How would you know that?

40:19.333 --> 40:20.333
Hey.

40:20.709 --> 40:23.170
Justin, Ani. Ani, Justin.

40:23.254 --> 40:24.254
Pleasure.

40:24.755 --> 40:27.425
You know, for a sour puss,
you have loads of friends.

40:28.509 --> 40:31.387
Tyler is my friend.
Justin lives with me and my family.

40:31.470 --> 40:32.471
They're adopting me.

40:32.888 --> 40:34.014
Oh, that's fantastic.

40:34.223 --> 40:36.684
Clay believes brothers should
take care of each other.

40:36.976 --> 40:39.103
I need... ketchup.

40:42.982 --> 40:43.982
[clears throat]

40:44.733 --> 40:49.905
So, he might seem like an uptight asshole
at first, maybe even for a while,

40:50.698 --> 40:51.698
but...

40:52.533 --> 40:55.870
he's a really good guy,
so just give him some time. He's worth it.

40:57.371 --> 40:58.371
How much time?

40:58.664 --> 40:59.664
Hmm.

40:59.707 --> 41:01.834
For me, it took, like, eight years, but...

41:04.003 --> 41:05.588
[Ani] <i>I thought Clay was funny,</i>

41:06.130 --> 41:07.381
<i>but not much beyond that.</i>

41:08.507 --> 41:10.509
<i>His friend Jessica was more interesting.</i>

41:10.593 --> 41:13.387
[Courtney] Principal Bolan is just asking
that we do something.

41:13.471 --> 41:16.724
[Jess] He just wants an excuse
to celebrate the damn athletes again.

41:16.807 --> 41:19.185
[Courtney] It's been a difficult time
for the whole school.

41:19.268 --> 41:21.353
[Jess] It's complete and total bullshit.

41:21.437 --> 41:23.439
[Courtney] So, in light
of the stressful events,

41:23.522 --> 41:27.276
Principal Bolan wants us to come up
with some ideas to promote school unity.

41:27.359 --> 41:30.196
Oh, that's fucking ridiculous
and you know it, Courtney.

41:30.279 --> 41:32.948
Can the secretary please strike "fucking"
from the record?

41:33.032 --> 41:36.243
I don't really actually take notes,
but okay.

41:36.327 --> 41:39.079
[Jess] I mean,
why are we even talking about unity?

41:39.663 --> 41:41.749
That's just, like, the administration

41:41.832 --> 41:45.628
wanting us to sit down and shut up
and not burn any more baseball fields.

41:46.587 --> 41:49.882
We don't need more school spirit,
we need actual change.

41:49.965 --> 41:51.675
- Right?
- Preach.

41:51.759 --> 41:53.928
[Jess] I mean, people are just done.

41:54.011 --> 41:56.722
We're pissed off.
And athletes are the problem.

41:56.805 --> 41:58.349
Jess, you're a cheerleader.

41:58.432 --> 41:59.767
I used to be a cheerleader.

41:59.850 --> 42:01.977
- Guys, please.
- [boy] Everyone blames the athletes.

42:02.061 --> 42:03.663
- [Jess] Athletes are the cause...
- Guys!

42:03.687 --> 42:06.899
- The cause of everything? That's bull!
- [Jess] Yes, everything!

42:06.982 --> 42:08.567
- [boy] Yeah, you can't...
- Hey!

42:08.651 --> 42:11.070
- [Jess] You're bullies and...
- Stop banging the hammer!

42:11.153 --> 42:12.279
It's called a gavel!

42:12.363 --> 42:14.073
The bullying, the harassment,

42:14.156 --> 42:16.033
you guys are always the root of it.

42:16.116 --> 42:18.702
And you guys never deal
with any of the consequences.

42:23.040 --> 42:25.834
Look, Jessica,
I am super sympathetic to your feelings.

42:25.918 --> 42:26.918
All right?

42:27.127 --> 42:30.130
Especially given the circumstances
under which I ascended to president,

42:30.339 --> 42:33.133
e.g. the ouster of Marcus,
the sexist pig who likes strippers.

42:33.676 --> 42:37.304
That being said,
the student council has no actual power

42:37.596 --> 42:39.598
and student councils as a rule never do.

42:39.807 --> 42:43.143
And like most, I actually just did it
for my college applications.

42:43.477 --> 42:45.157
So, if you really want
to stir some shit up

42:45.187 --> 42:47.314
and make this student council more
than just a joke,

42:47.523 --> 42:49.858
you should run for next year's president,
okay?

42:51.235 --> 42:52.945
New business, please.

42:56.490 --> 42:58.701
[girl] Graduation is only 46 days away

42:58.784 --> 43:01.453
and Principal Bolan wants us
to recruit underclassmen.

43:02.329 --> 43:03.581
I think you should do it.

43:05.040 --> 43:07.585
I think you're primed to explode
in good ways.

43:07.751 --> 43:09.003
I can tell things about people.

43:15.676 --> 43:17.261
Hey, new girl.

43:18.220 --> 43:19.805
Oh, Ani Achola.

43:19.930 --> 43:22.141
What do you mean I'm primed to explode?

43:22.224 --> 43:24.810
Oh, shit. I meant no offense.
I just meant...

43:25.686 --> 43:27.938
well, I look at you
and I see you're bad-arse.

43:29.607 --> 43:32.067
And you just walk up to people
and say shit like that?

43:33.402 --> 43:34.402
Uh...

43:34.820 --> 43:35.696
I do.

43:35.779 --> 43:36.614
[laughs]

43:36.697 --> 43:39.867
It's a bad habit I got in
while always being the new girl and

43:40.200 --> 43:41.285
not doing the shy thing.

43:41.994 --> 43:44.204
I pick the interesting people
and I make them friends.

43:44.872 --> 43:48.417
Speaking of which, I can be
your campaign manager, if you like.

43:49.418 --> 43:50.419
You want to be my...

43:50.919 --> 43:51.919
Wait, what?

43:52.004 --> 43:54.006
I've seen girls like you before and...

43:55.174 --> 43:56.300
I want to help you be heard.

43:57.426 --> 44:00.804
And you can help me with things,
like finding the robotics lab.

44:02.640 --> 44:03.640
You like robots?

44:04.516 --> 44:05.516
Yeah.

44:06.602 --> 44:07.602
Cool.

44:10.022 --> 44:11.774
It's in the main hall, at the end.

44:13.275 --> 44:16.236
- Thanks.
- Campaign strategy meeting tomorrow.

44:17.696 --> 44:18.906
After school.

44:21.659 --> 44:22.660
Hey...

44:25.371 --> 44:26.872
What do you mean, girls like me?

44:28.916 --> 44:31.210
Who've got power
they're finally ready to use.

44:36.924 --> 44:39.009
[Ani] <i> I met a few friends at school.</i>

44:39.843 --> 44:42.721
And then, Bryce Walker came into my life.

44:43.931 --> 44:45.307
[sobbing]

44:55.025 --> 44:55.859
Um...

44:55.943 --> 44:58.070
- hello?
- Hi.

45:01.156 --> 45:02.366
Can I help you with something?

45:02.783 --> 45:04.535
I'm just waiting for my mom to get home.

45:05.828 --> 45:07.788
Your mum is Mrs. Walker?

45:08.664 --> 45:10.499
My mom is Mrs. Walker, yeah.

45:11.041 --> 45:12.041
Oh.

45:12.251 --> 45:13.251
[laughs]

45:13.711 --> 45:14.920
- [laughs]
- Wow.

45:16.463 --> 45:18.340
And if I may, who are you?

45:19.216 --> 45:20.968
Sorry. Ani.

45:22.177 --> 45:24.847
My mum is your grandfather's nurse.

45:25.931 --> 45:26.931
Ani.

45:28.392 --> 45:29.435
It's nice to meet you.

45:30.018 --> 45:31.145
Nice to meet you...

45:32.521 --> 45:33.772
- Bryce.
- Bryce.

45:36.108 --> 45:37.651
My mother never mentioned me?

45:37.735 --> 45:39.695
Oh, no. No. I'm sure she did.

45:40.279 --> 45:42.906
- We've only been here a week or so.
- Yeah. Got it.

45:47.703 --> 45:50.914
I got home from Hillcrest today
and the house was full of fucking movers,

45:50.998 --> 45:53.041
packing up all the personal shit,
all my shit.

45:53.125 --> 45:55.419
Bryce, language. Please.

45:58.380 --> 45:59.590
He left me a note.

46:00.924 --> 46:02.009
On actual paper.

46:02.092 --> 46:04.344
I assume he went to the new house
in Telluride?

46:04.428 --> 46:05.429
You know about that?

46:05.512 --> 46:07.931
I'm divorcing him.
I know about everything.

46:09.224 --> 46:11.977
Yeah. Yeah, he moved with that woman

46:12.060 --> 46:13.103
to Telluride.

46:14.646 --> 46:16.482
And he told me to come live here.

46:17.816 --> 46:20.194
I've been calling him for hours.
He won't pick up.

46:20.986 --> 46:21.986
I'm sure.

46:22.905 --> 46:23.905
So...

46:26.200 --> 46:27.284
surprise!

46:28.410 --> 46:29.787
I'll have a room made up for you.

46:33.415 --> 46:35.501
So, is Grandpa, like...

46:36.668 --> 46:37.668
How's Grandpa?

46:38.253 --> 46:39.253
Dying.

46:39.838 --> 46:42.466
But slowly. So, that's nice.

46:45.344 --> 46:46.470
Mom, is this okay?

46:47.846 --> 46:48.847
Me being here.

46:49.848 --> 46:51.558
It'll have to be, won't it?

46:56.688 --> 46:57.688
[Ani's mum] Any news?

47:01.235 --> 47:02.235
There isn't.

47:02.945 --> 47:03.945
Still missing.

47:05.531 --> 47:06.907
Let me see to dinner.

47:07.783 --> 47:09.326
Some of those children...

47:10.285 --> 47:12.621
hated him so much.

47:14.414 --> 47:17.125
I imagine any number of them
might have wanted to hurt him.

47:20.295 --> 47:21.295
But why now?

47:21.839 --> 47:25.843
There's just something about
that whole mess at the Liberty Homecoming.

47:26.635 --> 47:28.345
Was it that Jessica Davies?

47:28.428 --> 47:30.013
That boy, Clay Jensen?

47:30.556 --> 47:34.226
[Ani's mum] I pray no one has hurt him,
Mrs. Walker. He's a good boy.

47:34.601 --> 47:35.601
Oh...

47:35.853 --> 47:36.853
Well...

47:38.814 --> 47:40.274
No, he isn't.

47:42.860 --> 47:44.611
Was Ani at Homecoming?

47:45.946 --> 47:47.786
- [Mrs. Walker] Friday night?
- [Ani's mum] No.

47:48.949 --> 47:49.949
[Ani's mum] No.

47:50.117 --> 47:51.994
[Ani] <i> Bryce Walker came into my life,</i>

47:52.703 --> 47:54.329

<i>And here's the thing,</i>

48:00.544 --> 48:03.046
<i>I know the Bryce that no one else knows.</i>

48:22.149 --> 48:23.149
Sorry.

48:24.693 --> 48:27.696
Oh, your mum said I should use the pool
whenever I...

48:28.363 --> 48:29.573
That's cool.

48:30.532 --> 48:31.533
Don't let me stop you.

48:52.930 --> 48:55.390
[Tony] I'm not worried
about the cops, Caleb.

48:55.474 --> 48:57.976
- They're asking all sorts of questions.
- Well, let them ask.

48:58.518 --> 49:00.479
What more can they do to me
at this point?

49:00.562 --> 49:02.898
- What more can they take away?
- I'm thinking a lot.

49:04.149 --> 49:05.984
They're not going to be interested
in me.

49:07.444 --> 49:09.071
You're a person of color in the life

49:09.154 --> 49:11.406

in a small town.

49:12.032 --> 49:13.033
They're interested.

49:13.116 --> 49:15.994
Well, you're a person of color
in his life, too, aren't you?

49:21.375 --> 49:22.876
What are you obsessing over?

49:24.461 --> 49:25.295
Homecoming.

49:25.379 --> 49:27.339
Like, everyone posted pictures of it.

49:28.674 --> 49:30.050
Do you remember anything...

49:30.717 --> 49:33.470
from the game
or everything that happened after?

49:33.553 --> 49:35.597
Anything that might tell us
where Bryce went?

49:35.681 --> 49:38.183
Not really. We talked some shit
during the game,

49:38.266 --> 49:40.560
but I didn't really see him
once shit got crazy.

49:44.064 --> 49:45.064
Where'd you get those?

49:45.565 --> 49:47.985
I got them from Tyler.
He had his camera that night.

49:54.616 --> 49:56.576
Wait. Zoom in on that last one.

50:01.790 --> 50:02.790
That's Zach.

50:03.166 --> 50:04.668
[Clay] And that's Bryce tackling him.

50:04.918 --> 50:07.087
[Justin] But he said it was number 82
who did it,

50:07.379 --> 50:09.548
the big-ass defensive end on Hillcrest.

50:10.841 --> 50:13.343
When we were helping Zach off the field,
he said it was 82.

50:13.635 --> 50:15.595
This morning he told me
he didn't know who did it.

50:15.971 --> 50:17.222
Why would he lie about that?

50:22.519 --> 50:23.687
