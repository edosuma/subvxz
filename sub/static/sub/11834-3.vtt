00:00.901 --> 00:02.536
<i>Previously on</i>
<i>"The Practice"...</i>

00:02.569 --> 00:04.470
When we ask,
"Did your sister seem suicidal?"

00:04.505 --> 00:07.574
A response of "I didn't
think so" isn't going to do it.

00:07.608 --> 00:10.176
She was murdered.
If you know it,

00:10.210 --> 00:14.447
she did not commit suicide.
You absolutely know it.

00:14.480 --> 00:15.782
She said that if she
turned up missing,

00:15.816 --> 00:17.584
that I should call the police

00:17.618 --> 00:20.086
because Scott probably
did something to her.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.522
BOBBY: Objection.

00:21.555 --> 00:23.189
You want me to sign this--
An affidavit saying

00:23.223 --> 00:24.791
I coached a witness to lie?

00:24.825 --> 00:28.061
He made that stuff up
about his sister being afraid.

00:28.094 --> 00:29.663
Helen, I told him

00:29.696 --> 00:31.331
what his testimony
needed to accomplish.

00:31.364 --> 00:33.099
I never said lie.

00:33.133 --> 00:35.101
I'm convinced that
Kyle Barrett lied on the stand

00:35.135 --> 00:37.838
after being coached
by the prosecution.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.607
I don't think Mr. Bay
crossed the line.

00:40.641 --> 00:43.710
I see no evidence
that he solicited perjury.

00:43.744 --> 00:46.279
The conviction,
therefore, stands.

00:48.148 --> 00:50.851
This thing was built
to bring children joy,

00:50.884 --> 00:52.218
and it's toxic.

00:52.252 --> 00:53.854
We have consistently found

00:53.887 --> 00:56.156
that it does not pose
an unreasonable risk

00:56.189 --> 00:58.725
to either children or adults.

00:58.759 --> 01:01.562
I have a boy
whose body convulses

01:01.595 --> 01:04.164
and a daughter
who keeps falling down

01:04.197 --> 01:05.666
and a son who can't read,

01:05.699 --> 01:07.400
and you people have known
for 30 years.

01:07.433 --> 01:09.570
We find in favor
of the plaintiff

01:09.603 --> 01:12.172
and order the defendant
to pay damages

01:12.205 --> 01:16.176
in the amount
of $72 million.

01:16.209 --> 01:18.178
I'm granting defense's motion
to remit.

01:18.211 --> 01:20.881
The knockdown number
is $135,000 per child.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.816
That's less than they offered.

01:22.849 --> 01:25.218
I don't care. Your case
was pure speculation, Counsel.

01:25.251 --> 01:27.253
We have a right
to a new trial.

01:27.287 --> 01:28.889
If you take a new trial,

01:28.922 --> 01:32.292
you'll be right back before me,
Ms. Frutt, and if you do win,

01:32.325 --> 01:35.195
I might remit
the next knockdown to $75,000.

01:35.228 --> 01:37.397
I'm going to get him.

01:37.430 --> 01:42.135
That judge--
I'm going to get him.

01:42.168 --> 01:43.870
Sixty bucks.
That's something.

01:43.904 --> 01:45.506
-You don't have to do that--
-No, take it.

01:45.539 --> 01:46.873
You pay me back
when you get it.

01:46.907 --> 01:49.142
Listen, Jennifer,
you're a smart girl,

01:49.175 --> 01:50.711
a good girl.

01:50.744 --> 01:52.713
I can judge character.

01:52.746 --> 01:54.581
Don't be doing this.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.149
Thank you.

01:56.182 --> 01:58.552
Go. Wipe that stuff
off your face.

01:58.585 --> 01:59.920
I will pay you back.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.255
Yeah, well, in the meantime,

02:02.288 --> 02:03.557
get a paper route
or something.

02:03.590 --> 02:05.225
Don't be doing this.

02:26.346 --> 02:27.914
Jimmy.

02:27.948 --> 02:31.184
You're having a kid?
You didn't tell me that.

02:31.217 --> 02:33.253
I didn't want you
to get mad.

02:33.286 --> 02:35.255
How could you
still be doing drugs?

02:35.288 --> 02:37.624
It was just this one time.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.292
Billy left me.

02:39.325 --> 02:41.361
He left me like this.
I just--

02:41.394 --> 02:42.929
What about rehab?

02:42.963 --> 02:44.798
I called that number
that you gave me,

02:44.831 --> 02:47.968
but they said that I couldn't
interview for two weeks,

02:48.001 --> 02:49.736
and then I lost the number.

02:49.770 --> 02:51.371
How far along are you?

02:54.541 --> 02:56.409
Eight months.

03:06.419 --> 03:08.555
Can't you get me out?

03:13.827 --> 03:16.329
Jimmy.

03:16.362 --> 03:19.465
You're smoking crack
with an eight-month baby.

03:19.499 --> 03:21.968
-It was just once, I swear.
-No, it wasn't.

03:22.002 --> 03:23.704
Jimmy, I'll do the rehab.

03:23.737 --> 03:26.507
I'll do anything
that you want me to do.

03:26.540 --> 03:27.841
Please, just get me out.

03:36.349 --> 03:37.684
If I get you out,

03:37.718 --> 03:39.686
and I'm not saying I can--

03:39.720 --> 03:43.657
But if I do, you go
into rehab immediately,

03:43.690 --> 03:46.459
straight from the courthouse.

03:46.492 --> 03:48.328
I promise.

03:55.401 --> 03:57.437
Tell me about the arrest.

04:00.541 --> 04:01.908
â™ª (theme)

04:53.493 --> 04:55.862
Okay, everyone,
let's get started.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.764
Did somebody make it official
that you're in charge?

04:57.798 --> 05:00.100
Brains, beauty, and character.
Don't knock it.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.868
Okay, let's go. Jimmy.

05:01.902 --> 05:04.104
Jennifer Cole--
Possession of crack cocaine.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.572
Again?

05:05.606 --> 05:07.941
I got a motion
to kick at nine.

05:07.974 --> 05:09.710
She's eight months pregnant.

05:09.743 --> 05:12.779
What? And she's smoking crack?

05:12.813 --> 05:14.981
Believe me, I tore
into her already.

05:15.015 --> 05:16.883
She better hope
her baby doesn't die.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.885
She could be
charged with murder.
Did you tell her that?

05:18.919 --> 05:21.855
I'm not positive I did,
but I will. Thank you, Lindsay.

05:21.888 --> 05:24.390
She should be shot.

05:24.424 --> 05:25.692
All right, Bec,
how's the research coming?

05:25.726 --> 05:27.460
Okay.

05:27.493 --> 05:28.762
Can you give me something
more to go on than "okay"?

05:28.795 --> 05:30.430
I'm seeing Scott Wallace later.

05:30.463 --> 05:33.466
Sure. We can argue
reversible error

05:33.499 --> 05:35.802
when Judge Wolfe didn't have
an evidentiary hearing

05:35.836 --> 05:37.804
on whether Richard Bay
suborned perjury.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.640
Now, since we have
Helen Gamble with us,

05:39.673 --> 05:43.009
-I think that's our best shot.
-What else?

05:43.043 --> 05:44.811
Well, the neighbor's testimony
that he heard lots of fights

05:44.845 --> 05:46.613
between Scott Wallace
and his wife--

05:46.647 --> 05:48.414
Prior bad conduct,
inadmissible.

05:48.448 --> 05:50.016
We could argue
reversible error there, too.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.886
All right. Lucy, keep dogging
the clerk's office.

05:52.919 --> 05:55.488
Ellenor, jump in with Rebecca
on the brief.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.891
I can't, actually.
I'm a little jammed.

05:57.924 --> 05:59.893
Not on my calendar,
you're not.

05:59.926 --> 06:02.495
I have an appointment
with the chief judge

06:02.529 --> 06:04.397
of the district court today.

06:04.430 --> 06:05.465
About what?

06:05.498 --> 06:07.000
Judge Aldrich.

06:07.033 --> 06:10.003
I didn't know.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.905
I'm keeping you
out of it, since--

06:11.938 --> 06:13.907
Ellenor, we can't afford
to be alienating--

06:13.940 --> 06:15.475
It's one meeting.

06:15.509 --> 06:17.477
The appointment's made.
I'm doing it.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.913
Aldrich was out of line.
I'm not staying quiet.

06:19.946 --> 06:20.981
Forget it.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.490
I was observing
4323 South Holden Green.

06:30.524 --> 06:32.492
It's a known crack house.

06:32.526 --> 06:35.529
I witnessed Jennifer Cole
exiting.

06:35.562 --> 06:36.863
She was stumbling
and disoriented,

06:36.897 --> 06:38.699
her appearance consistent

06:38.732 --> 06:39.933
with being under
the influence of drugs.

06:39.966 --> 06:41.668
What did you do?

06:41.702 --> 06:43.670
I exited my vehicle,
approached the suspect,

06:43.704 --> 06:45.672
identified myself
as a police officer,

06:45.706 --> 06:47.674
and then engaged her
in conversation.

06:47.708 --> 06:50.443
Her behavior confirmed
my suspicion she was high.

06:50.476 --> 06:53.547
Could you describe
that behavior?

06:53.580 --> 06:56.449
She was sweating and jittery
and was slurring her speech.

06:56.482 --> 06:58.218
What did you do then,
Officer?

06:58.251 --> 07:00.621
I conducted a quick
pat-down search for weapons,

07:00.654 --> 07:03.557
and I could plainly feel
an object in her jacket pocket.

07:03.590 --> 07:04.991
It was immediately
apparent to me

07:05.025 --> 07:06.693
that the object was
a rock of crack cocaine.

07:06.727 --> 07:08.695
How did you know?

07:08.729 --> 07:10.230
Well, I've received
extensive training

07:10.263 --> 07:11.965
in recognizing crack.

07:11.998 --> 07:14.234
I felt a small object,
asymmetrical, rough edges--

07:14.267 --> 07:15.836
A rock of crack.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.571
Then what?

07:17.604 --> 07:19.973
Then I reached
inside the defendant's jacket

07:20.006 --> 07:21.975
and removed approximately
100 milligrams

07:22.008 --> 07:23.844
of what was determined
to be crack cocaine

07:23.877 --> 07:25.846
wrapped in paper.

07:25.879 --> 07:28.114
This rock of crack--
How big was it?

07:28.148 --> 07:29.916
About a half an inch
in diameter.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.252
So that's no bigger
than, what, an aspirin?

07:32.285 --> 07:34.588
About that size.

07:34.621 --> 07:37.824
And this tiny, little thing was,
as you put it, wrapped in paper?

07:37.858 --> 07:39.492
That's correct.

07:39.526 --> 07:40.861
In fact, it was

07:40.894 --> 07:42.596
inside a scrunched-up
brown paper bag, right?

07:42.629 --> 07:43.597
Yes.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.031
And the bag was

07:45.065 --> 07:47.033
inside her jacket--
A big winter overcoat, in fact?

07:47.067 --> 07:49.202
I don't recall exactly.

07:49.235 --> 07:50.937
Officer, I'm showing you

07:50.971 --> 07:52.806
what's been admitted
as people's three.

07:52.839 --> 07:54.841
This the jacket
miss Cole was wearing?

07:54.875 --> 07:56.276
Looks like it, yeah.

07:56.309 --> 07:59.045
So, you do this one pat
of Ms. Cole's body.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.114
Through this
thick down overcoat

08:01.147 --> 08:03.116
and through
a crumpled-up paper bag,

08:03.149 --> 08:04.951
you feel
this tiny, little lump,

08:04.985 --> 08:06.953
and you immediately know
it's crack cocaine?

08:06.987 --> 08:08.288
Yes.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.023
No way
it was jewelry, candy?

08:10.056 --> 08:11.625
No.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.627
All this
from just one pat?

08:13.660 --> 08:17.531
Yes. We received comprehensive
and extensive training--

08:17.564 --> 08:19.966
How many times have
you used these comprehensive

08:20.000 --> 08:21.802
and extensive
training techniques

08:21.835 --> 08:23.970
to frisk suspects
for crack cocaine, Officer?

08:24.004 --> 08:25.872
Probably 10 times.

08:25.906 --> 08:27.874
And how many arrests resulted

08:27.908 --> 08:30.677
from these comprehensively
trained pat-downs, Officer?

08:32.345 --> 08:34.648
Two or three.

08:34.681 --> 08:37.583
So the other eight people
you frisked were innocent?

08:40.754 --> 08:43.155
Nothing further, Your Honor.

08:43.188 --> 08:45.792
Ms. Alexander?

08:45.826 --> 08:48.328
The witness may step down.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.631
Does the commonwealth
have anything else?

08:50.664 --> 08:53.066
No, but I would like
to remind the court

08:53.099 --> 08:55.068
that in addition
to pat-downs

08:55.101 --> 08:56.803
being constitutionally
permissible,

08:56.837 --> 08:58.639
this woman
is eight months pregnant,

08:58.672 --> 09:00.641
and I would like to ask
the court

09:00.674 --> 09:02.275
to seriously consider
the consequences of--

09:02.308 --> 09:04.745
The charges against Ms. Cole
are dismissed without prejudice.

09:04.778 --> 09:09.149
You bring me some new evidence,
you can refile.

09:09.182 --> 09:11.685
Ms. Cole, you're free to go.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.169
I want to thank you,
Your Honor,

09:29.202 --> 09:30.704
for being gracious enough
to see me.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.706
Well, there was nothing
gracious about it.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.809
You somehow got my home number
and woke me from a deep sleep.

09:35.842 --> 09:39.245
I had no idea
what I was saying yes to.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.247
We were basically blackmailed,
Your Honor.

09:41.281 --> 09:44.751
Judge Aldrich told us
to accept

09:44.785 --> 09:47.287
the knockdown number
or else,

09:47.320 --> 09:49.355
and the "or else" being
that he would order a new trial,

09:49.389 --> 09:53.760
keep the case,
and steer us into defeat.

09:53.794 --> 09:57.397
You're talking about one
of my most respected colleagues.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.733
Who comitted gross abuse
of discretion.

09:59.766 --> 10:03.804
What he did did not respect you,
Your Honor or the court.

10:03.837 --> 10:05.305
It was blackmail.

10:05.338 --> 10:08.041
And I am not overstating it.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.377
You can substantiate this?

10:11.411 --> 10:14.247
Yes, my co-counsel
Lindsay Dole was present

10:14.280 --> 10:15.882
as was opposing counsel.

10:15.916 --> 10:17.317
(scoffs)

10:18.985 --> 10:20.821
If you thought the judge
was out of bounds,

10:20.854 --> 10:22.789
you should have asked
the court reporter to step in.

10:22.823 --> 10:24.891
He never would have said that
on the record.

10:24.925 --> 10:28.161
But you need a record in order
for me to act, Ms. Frutt.

10:28.194 --> 10:31.231
At minimum, you should
have appealed the reduction.

10:31.264 --> 10:35.068
Instead, you agreed
to the knockdown
and you took the money.

10:35.101 --> 10:37.170
My clients took it under duress.

10:37.203 --> 10:38.905
Well, that was a big mistake.

10:38.939 --> 10:40.774
And you made it.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.408
Maybe that's what's eating you.

10:42.442 --> 10:45.712
What's eating me is being
blackmailed by a judge.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.413
What he did was corrupt.

10:47.447 --> 10:51.117
I don't see that
on any appellate record.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.157
What would be my options?

10:58.725 --> 11:00.694
You could move for a new trial,

11:00.727 --> 11:03.329
request that Judge Aldrich
recuse himself.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.899
But Judge Aldrich would be
the one who would rule

11:05.932 --> 11:07.067
on those motions.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.468
Correct.

11:08.502 --> 11:11.137
Is there another option?

11:13.039 --> 11:14.841
You could file amotion with
the circuit court of appeals

11:14.875 --> 11:16.476
to have him removed for bias.

11:16.510 --> 11:19.312
That's what I want to do.

11:20.914 --> 11:23.750
It would be your word
against his.

11:23.784 --> 11:26.820
And these judges would be
federal circuit court judges.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.488
Do you understand?

11:28.522 --> 11:32.292
He doesn't just get
a jury of his peers here.

11:32.325 --> 11:34.194
He gets his friends.

11:34.227 --> 11:36.096
That's what I wanna do.

11:36.129 --> 11:40.266
I'd think long and hard
about that Ms. Frutt.

11:40.300 --> 11:43.269
Well, now it sounds like
you're threatening me.

11:43.303 --> 11:47.307
No, I'm giving you some advice.

11:49.543 --> 11:53.947
I want to file
a formal complaint.

12:07.293 --> 12:09.796
Richard, is this it?
We're never talking again?

12:09.830 --> 12:12.032
There's nothing really
to talk about, Helen.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.234
Would you at least
give me 20 seconds.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.340
I know this goes against
your fiber,

12:20.373 --> 12:23.977
but sometimes the people
we charge with crimes
are innocent.

12:24.010 --> 12:25.979
Scott Wallace is not innocent.

12:26.012 --> 12:28.081
My point being I think he is.

12:28.114 --> 12:30.917
I also believe a witness
lied after you coached him.

12:33.286 --> 12:34.555
Richard, we're officers
of the court.

12:34.588 --> 12:36.422
It has to mean something.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.024
I understand that, Helen.

12:38.058 --> 12:40.561
I also understood you
to be my friend,

12:40.594 --> 12:43.496
and you cut my legs out.

12:43.530 --> 12:45.566
You basically accused me
in open court

12:45.599 --> 12:47.568
of being dishonest.

12:47.601 --> 12:50.571
You're taking it
a little too personally.

12:50.604 --> 12:53.439
Let me tell you something,
Helen.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.141
I get called
a lot of things.

12:55.175 --> 12:57.410
The defense attorneys
call me The Midget.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.145
The judges call me
Little Napoleon.

12:59.179 --> 13:00.981
I take a lot of abuse,

13:01.014 --> 13:02.983
but I get through it every day

13:03.016 --> 13:04.851
because I also have a reputation

13:04.885 --> 13:06.853
for being good at what I do,

13:06.887 --> 13:09.856
and I have a reputation
for being an honest person.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.858
That reputation is dear to me,

13:11.892 --> 13:13.860
and when a colleague,
a friend,

13:13.894 --> 13:16.496
stands up and obliterates
that reputation,

13:16.530 --> 13:18.999
it's personal.

13:21.267 --> 13:23.236
Hey, Richard.

13:23.269 --> 13:25.806
Helen.

13:27.608 --> 13:29.242
Jimmy.

13:29.275 --> 13:32.145
Hey, I thought I could
drive you to the hospital.

13:32.178 --> 13:34.581
-Hospital?
-Rehab.

13:34.615 --> 13:37.350
I got you all set up.
You can do it outpatient.

13:37.383 --> 13:42.222
Well, I was going to go
see my aunt today.

13:42.255 --> 13:45.358
You can see her after,
Jennifer. You promised.

13:47.427 --> 13:48.595
Okay.

13:51.064 --> 13:53.066
-What's up?
-Mr. Berluti,
please step aside.

13:53.099 --> 13:55.035
Jennifer Cole,
you're under arrest.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.469
-Arrest?
-Hands behind your back.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.438
What the hell
is going on, Susan?

13:58.471 --> 14:00.607
Distribution of a controlled
substance to a minor.

14:00.641 --> 14:02.943
-Distribution?
-Distribution of what?

14:02.976 --> 14:04.244
Don't say anything.
What the hell are
you talking about?

14:04.277 --> 14:06.146
-Distributing to who?
-The baby.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.481
-My baby?
-You're smoking crack
for two now.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.951
What is she talking about?
What are you doing? Jimmy!

14:10.984 --> 14:12.886
-JENNIFER: Jimmy!
-You have the right
to remain silent.

14:12.919 --> 14:15.155
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

14:15.188 --> 14:17.157
in a court of law.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.259
You have the right
to talk to a lawyer

14:19.292 --> 14:22.095
and have him present with you
while you're being questioned.

14:29.503 --> 14:32.205
Just calm down
and hear me out.

14:32.238 --> 14:34.007
I won't hear you out.
This is so ridiculous.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.176
There's never been
a case made

14:36.209 --> 14:38.178
for distributing to a fetus,
and you know it.

14:38.211 --> 14:41.648
Just because it's never
been made before.

14:41.682 --> 14:43.383
She distributed cocaine
to her baby

14:43.416 --> 14:45.451
through her bloodstream.

14:45.485 --> 14:48.589
I'll be moving for sanctions
on this, and I'll get them.

14:48.622 --> 14:52.659
How sure are you she won't
use again, like tomorrow?

14:52.693 --> 14:55.495
She has a viable baby.

14:55.529 --> 14:59.332
If she hasn't done any damage
yet, she might the next time.

14:59.365 --> 15:01.301
I'm just looking
to get her off the street

15:01.334 --> 15:02.402
until the child is born.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.070
I got her in rehab.

15:04.104 --> 15:06.206
Yeah, voluntary, outpatient.
Come on.

15:06.239 --> 15:09.175
-You still can't arrest her.
-Technically, I can make
the case.

15:09.209 --> 15:10.677
-Read the statute, Jimmy.
-You're deluding yourself.

15:10.711 --> 15:12.412
There's no way
you can win this, Susan.

15:12.445 --> 15:13.980
-It could be blood to blood.
-You can't win.

15:14.014 --> 15:16.116
I can if you don't fight me.

15:21.387 --> 15:23.957
You're asking me
to conspire with you

15:23.990 --> 15:26.492
to keep her in jail?

15:26.527 --> 15:30.496
One month until the baby
is born.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.571
I know you care
for this woman.

15:37.604 --> 15:40.507
I do, and I'm telling you,
she'll go crazy inside.

15:40.541 --> 15:42.643
She needs help, not jail.

15:42.676 --> 15:44.978
This is the only way
she's going to get help.

15:45.011 --> 15:47.313
If she walks, it'll be straight
to the local crack house.

15:47.347 --> 15:49.516
We don't know that.

15:49.550 --> 15:52.118
Do you know what crack
does to a baby?

15:52.152 --> 15:54.521
It cuts off the blood flow,
oxygen, nutrients,

15:54.555 --> 15:58.144
seizures, heart attacks,
brain damage.

16:00.761 --> 16:03.063
Let's plead this out.

16:03.096 --> 16:05.532
In-patient rehab
No jail.

16:09.135 --> 16:12.072
You're asking me to cop
to a bogus charge.

16:12.105 --> 16:14.440
I'm asking you to consider.

16:14.474 --> 16:17.511
You really have
two clients here.

16:17.544 --> 16:20.380
Susan...

16:20.413 --> 16:22.415
If she gets out,
she'll O. D., miscarry.

16:22.448 --> 16:24.017
Who knows what
will happen?

16:24.050 --> 16:25.686
She trusts you,
and you can help her.

16:35.495 --> 16:38.464
It's a complete long shot.
This is a very popular judge,

16:38.498 --> 16:40.734
and the other judges aren't
likely to sanction him.

16:40.767 --> 16:43.036
What about the settlement
that we agreed to?

16:43.069 --> 16:45.706
Well, if we undo it,
hopefully, we can get you more.

16:45.739 --> 16:47.674
In defeat,
you keep what you have.

16:47.708 --> 16:49.810
So what happens?

16:49.843 --> 16:51.512
Well, we have a hearing
scheduled for tomorrow at 3:30.

16:51.545 --> 16:53.614
There's nothing to lose.

16:53.647 --> 16:56.282
-Okay.
-Okay.

16:58.218 --> 17:01.722
You filed a formal motion
against Aldrich?

17:01.755 --> 17:03.790
What's the problem?

17:03.824 --> 17:06.192
The problem, Ellenor, is this
is not something attorneys do.

17:06.226 --> 17:08.261
Why? Because the federal court
is like a club

17:08.294 --> 17:10.262
as far as judges go.

17:10.296 --> 17:12.265
They have tenure.
They stick together,

17:12.298 --> 17:14.635
and the only thing
that will come out of this

17:14.667 --> 17:17.103
is this firm will be
retaliated against.

17:17.137 --> 17:19.105
Oh, please.
What can they do to us?

17:19.138 --> 17:21.107
What can they do to us?

17:21.141 --> 17:22.608
You just saw firsthand
what they can do.

17:22.643 --> 17:25.145
They can cut damage awards,
overturn verdicts,

17:25.178 --> 17:27.113
give lousy instructions,
deny bail, cut fees.

17:27.146 --> 17:29.115
What can't they do?

17:29.149 --> 17:31.484
Not to mention they could
put all our cases

17:31.518 --> 17:33.486
at the bottom of the docket,

17:33.520 --> 17:35.488
and we'd never even
get to trial.

17:35.522 --> 17:37.524
What you're doing here
could hurt all our clients.

17:37.558 --> 17:40.326
At a minimum this should've
been the subject

17:40.360 --> 17:42.228
of a partnership meeting.

17:42.262 --> 17:43.764
Well, I've had bad experiences
with partnership meetings.

17:43.797 --> 17:46.299
Snide isn't what
I was looking for.

17:46.332 --> 17:48.301
Bobby, I have a plan, okay?

17:48.334 --> 17:50.571
I was hoping to avoid
the hearing against Aldrich.

17:50.604 --> 17:51.772
How?

17:51.805 --> 17:53.339
I have a meeting scheduled

17:53.373 --> 17:54.474
with the lawyers
for the E. P. A.

17:54.508 --> 17:55.709
I think with just
the threat

17:55.742 --> 17:57.410
of the knockdown number
being thrown out,

17:57.443 --> 17:59.179
I can chip the number up
a little.

17:59.212 --> 18:00.581
Somehow I don't believe

18:00.614 --> 18:04.217
this is about chipping up
a number.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.252
I am only trying
to help the client.

18:06.286 --> 18:09.255
This is not about vengeance.

18:13.159 --> 18:14.861
I don't understand.

18:14.895 --> 18:17.163
You plead guilty
to distribution.

18:17.197 --> 18:19.566
They'll recommend
straight probation for a year.

18:19.600 --> 18:21.167
Probation?

18:21.201 --> 18:22.736
So long as you get
residential treatment.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.705
I hate those places, Jimmy--

18:24.738 --> 18:26.272
All those freaky junkies
and weirdos.

18:26.306 --> 18:27.741
It'd be like poison
for the baby.

18:27.774 --> 18:30.376
You need help, Jennifer.
You've got an addiction.

18:30.410 --> 18:33.146
I do not!
I can stop whenever!

18:33.179 --> 18:35.148
Then why haven't you?

18:35.181 --> 18:37.150
Eight months pregnant--
Why the hell haven't you?

18:43.189 --> 18:45.425
I'll go to my aunt's house.

18:45.458 --> 18:49.229
There's this little room.
It's like the perfect size.

18:49.262 --> 18:51.364
I got no curtains yet,

18:51.397 --> 18:53.567
'cause they're either going
to be blue or pink, you know?

18:53.600 --> 18:54.935
Jennifer...

18:54.968 --> 18:56.937
Rehab's no place for a baby.

18:56.970 --> 18:59.172
The baby should be at home.

19:02.208 --> 19:05.445
Please, Jimmy, what do I do?

19:11.484 --> 19:15.722
They got a case here,
and they're real serious.

19:15.756 --> 19:19.325
I think you ought
to take the plea.

19:19.359 --> 19:23.263
It's the best thing for you.

19:23.296 --> 19:25.498
You really can't
make it go away?

19:25.532 --> 19:28.468
No.

19:47.588 --> 19:50.957
-How long?
-We're hoping next week.

19:50.991 --> 19:52.826
No, no, you got
to push it up, Bobby.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.360
I can't take this place.

19:54.394 --> 19:56.496
I mean, they see me
as some rich guy.

19:56.530 --> 19:58.498
I mean, I'm going
to be meeting up

19:58.532 --> 20:00.266
with the end of a broomstick
in here.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.769
-Scott.
-You got to get me out.

20:02.803 --> 20:06.339
I mean, minimum security,
something, work release?

20:06.372 --> 20:07.641
-Scott--
-I got money.

20:07.674 --> 20:09.976
Milken got out with money.
I can pay.

20:10.010 --> 20:12.445
He was in on securities fraud.
You're in for murder.

20:12.478 --> 20:14.414
Get me out!

20:21.655 --> 20:23.990
We're trying to push up
the appeal

20:24.024 --> 20:27.594
as soon as possible,
Scott.

20:27.628 --> 20:30.030
Look, I'll get
a new trial, right?

20:30.063 --> 20:33.266
I mean, the judge made
all of those mistakes.

20:33.299 --> 20:35.602
I mean, I got to get
a new trial.

20:35.636 --> 20:37.604
Give me a brand-new trial.

20:37.638 --> 20:40.541
That's what we're hoping for.

20:40.574 --> 20:43.376
See, you got to hurry, Bobby.
See?

20:43.409 --> 20:45.378
I thought I was okay,

20:45.411 --> 20:48.448
but I'm feeling maybe I'm not.

20:48.481 --> 20:52.352
You just hurry, okay?

20:54.054 --> 20:56.389
Okay.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.596
Do you expect us
to laugh?

21:02.629 --> 21:04.965
No, I don't expect that,
Mr. Meyers.

21:04.998 --> 21:07.768
We have a hearing set up
for tomorrow.

21:07.801 --> 21:10.070
These are your subpoenas
to appear as witnesses.

21:10.103 --> 21:13.039
-If you refuse--
-And you think if you
call us as witnesses

21:13.073 --> 21:15.542
we'll testify that Judge Aldrich
was guilty of blackmail?

21:15.576 --> 21:17.611
I think if called
as a witness,

21:17.644 --> 21:19.613
you will give
truthful testimony, yes,

21:19.646 --> 21:21.982
and we all know
what happened in that room.

21:22.015 --> 21:24.618
Ms. Frutt, I truly do
admire your fortitude,

21:24.651 --> 21:26.419
but if you have any notion

21:26.452 --> 21:27.821
that we will compromise
our client's interests--

21:27.854 --> 21:29.990
You wouldn't be lawyers
in this proceeding.

21:30.023 --> 21:31.324
You'd be witnesses.

21:31.357 --> 21:33.694
You're insane.

21:35.896 --> 21:36.897
Look, we're not
really here trying

21:36.930 --> 21:38.364
to secure you as witnesses.

21:38.398 --> 21:40.366
Why are you here?

21:40.400 --> 21:42.769
If we're successful
at overturning Judge Aldrich,

21:42.803 --> 21:45.371
that $72 million verdict
could be reinstated.

21:45.405 --> 21:47.007
You have to be concerned
about that.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.408
We're not.

21:48.441 --> 21:50.511
Do you really want
to risk it?

21:50.544 --> 21:52.045
The odds of that panel
overturning Judge Aldrich

21:52.078 --> 21:56.950
Do you want to risk it?
$72 million.

21:56.983 --> 22:00.020
Why don't you get
to the punch line?

22:00.053 --> 22:02.523
For $6 million, we'll drop
the complaint against Aldrich.

22:02.556 --> 22:04.958
Once again, I must ask,

22:04.991 --> 22:07.060
do you expect us to laugh?

22:07.093 --> 22:10.063
You won't be laughing
if the 72 comes back.

22:10.096 --> 22:12.733
I think we'll run that risk.
Anything else?

22:16.803 --> 22:18.905
The hearing is scheduled
for tomorrow at 3:30.

22:18.939 --> 22:21.141
You have received your summons.

22:21.174 --> 22:25.579
Yes, and between now and then,
we'll be sure to go over
our testimony.

22:25.612 --> 22:28.549
You really are an ass,
you know that?

22:28.582 --> 22:30.717
Tell a friend.

22:49.035 --> 22:51.137
He's extremely erratic.
He was going on and on

22:51.171 --> 22:53.406
about buying his way
out of jail.

22:53.439 --> 22:55.108
-Is he talking
about Fiji again?
-No, but--

22:55.141 --> 22:57.143
I just got off with the clerk
from the appellate court.

22:57.177 --> 22:58.745
They can hear you next Tuesday.

22:58.779 --> 23:00.781
Schedule it.
Can you have the brief ready?

23:00.814 --> 23:02.883
-Yeah, it'll be done.
-What time's the hearing?

23:02.916 --> 23:04.518
3:30.

23:04.551 --> 23:05.586
I'm going to go see
Aldrich now.

23:05.619 --> 23:07.087
What? Why?

23:07.120 --> 23:09.022
I'm going to try
the velvet glove first.

23:09.055 --> 23:10.557
You really think this guy's
going to listen to you

23:10.591 --> 23:13.093
after you filed a motion
against him?

23:16.697 --> 23:20.601
Docket number 3542--
Commonwealth v. Jennifer Cole.

23:20.634 --> 23:22.969
Susan Alexander for
the commonwealth, Your Honor.

23:23.003 --> 23:24.571
James Berluti
for the defendant.

23:24.605 --> 23:25.939
Waive reading.
We're entering a plea of guilty

23:25.972 --> 23:27.541
pursuant to an agreement.

23:27.574 --> 23:29.209
Let's hear it.

23:29.242 --> 23:31.477
One year in the house
of corrections, suspended.

23:31.512 --> 23:32.979
One year probation,

23:33.013 --> 23:34.948
as long as she enters
a detox center today.

23:34.981 --> 23:37.584
Upon release, she immediately
goes to a halfway house,

23:37.618 --> 23:40.486
then to a sober facility
for the term of her probation.

23:40.521 --> 23:41.688
Just a second.

23:41.722 --> 23:43.757
This is the same offense
as yesterday?

23:43.790 --> 23:46.059
No, Your Honor. This has
nothing to do with the search.

23:46.092 --> 23:48.595
The defendant was seen
by witnesses ingesting cocaine.

23:48.629 --> 23:52.766
The charge is distribution.

23:52.799 --> 23:55.536
She is in her eighth month
of pregnancy.

23:55.569 --> 23:56.970
She ingested cocaine,

23:57.003 --> 23:58.839
distributing the drug
to her unborn child.

23:58.872 --> 24:00.240
Come again?

24:00.273 --> 24:02.743
The distribution
was to her fetus.

24:05.879 --> 24:08.749
-What's going on?
-We're fine. Don't worry.

24:08.782 --> 24:11.184
-Mr. Berluti.
-Yes, Your Honor.

24:11.217 --> 24:13.186
You have fully explained
to your client

24:13.219 --> 24:15.522
the nature of these charges?

24:15.556 --> 24:17.624
Yes, Your Honor.
Ms. Cole understands
the charges against her.

24:17.658 --> 24:19.192
Do you?

24:21.762 --> 24:25.732
Ms. Cole.
Did Mr. Berluti explain

24:25.766 --> 24:27.568
that it is
extremely unorthodox

24:27.601 --> 24:29.670
for a pregnant woman to be
charged with this crime?

24:29.703 --> 24:32.038
Sorry?

24:32.072 --> 24:36.076
What did your lawyer say
about the case against you?

24:37.878 --> 24:41.181
I don't know.
He said I should take the plea.

24:41.214 --> 24:43.950
-Did he say why?
-Your Honor--

24:43.984 --> 24:45.819
I am addressing the defendant.

24:45.852 --> 24:48.555
Did he say why
you should take the plea?

24:48.589 --> 24:51.925
He said we probably
wouldn't win this.

24:51.958 --> 24:56.453
Mr. Berluti,
Ms. Alexander, chambers!

24:57.998 --> 25:00.601
I have never seen
this law enforced

25:00.634 --> 25:01.835
against pregnant women.

25:01.868 --> 25:03.537
That doesn't mean it can't be.

25:03.570 --> 25:05.939
I'm not sure
you're right about that,

25:05.972 --> 25:08.308
but even if you are,
I see no basis

25:08.341 --> 25:10.577
for a defense attorney
to surrender.

25:10.611 --> 25:13.179
What did you two do,

25:13.213 --> 25:14.615
decide on a punishment,

25:14.648 --> 25:16.983
then flip
through the general laws

25:17.017 --> 25:18.552
in search of a crime?

25:18.585 --> 25:20.554
I don't believe
you have the right

25:20.587 --> 25:22.689
to change a plea agreement.

25:22.723 --> 25:24.725
I certainly have the right
to reject one.

25:24.758 --> 25:25.992
On what grounds?

25:26.026 --> 25:28.595
Due process,
unethical behavior,

25:28.629 --> 25:31.331
lack of legal basis,
collusion.

25:31.364 --> 25:34.067
Take your pick.

25:34.100 --> 25:37.571
What's our role today,
Mr. Berluti?

25:37.604 --> 25:39.573
Lawyer or mother?

25:39.606 --> 25:42.609
I advised my client.

25:42.643 --> 25:44.578
The fact that you may disagree
with my advice

25:44.611 --> 25:46.279
does not make me unethical.

25:46.312 --> 25:48.649
You took an oath
to zealously represent

25:48.682 --> 25:51.818
your client's legal interests,
Counsel.

25:51.852 --> 25:56.590
Getting her into rehab
doesn't qualify.

25:56.623 --> 25:58.659
Did you inform her

25:58.692 --> 26:00.761
that this case
would likely not make?

26:00.794 --> 26:03.229
I told her I couldn't be sure.

26:05.732 --> 26:09.202
Mr. Berluti, you might
as well answer my question,

26:09.235 --> 26:11.605
because next
I will be asking her.

26:11.638 --> 26:14.240
Did your client,
when agreeing to this plea,

26:14.274 --> 26:16.943
fully appreciate
that she would probably

26:16.977 --> 26:20.714
not be convicted of the crime
with which she was charged?

26:20.747 --> 26:22.849
My client is a crack head.

26:22.883 --> 26:24.718
She can't even fully appreciate

26:24.751 --> 26:26.920
that she's killing her baby.

26:32.659 --> 26:34.928
The plea is rejected.

26:34.961 --> 26:38.632
I am reporting both of you
to the state bar. Get out.

26:38.665 --> 26:41.267
Ever see a cocaine baby,
Your Honor?

26:42.370 --> 26:47.407
Mr. Berluti, you are
an officer of the court...

26:47.440 --> 26:51.812
who is one word away
from contempt.

27:01.688 --> 27:03.724
We really don't want
to go after you.

27:03.757 --> 27:05.826
I'm touched by that.

27:05.859 --> 27:07.828
Your Honor,
we have great respect

27:07.861 --> 27:09.830
for both you
and your position,

27:09.863 --> 27:12.432
but our feeling is
you did cross a line here.

27:12.465 --> 27:14.868
Let me tell you something,
Ms. Dole.

27:14.901 --> 27:17.871
I was at that trial every day.

27:17.904 --> 27:19.840
There was no case.

27:19.873 --> 27:23.710
You people should be laughing
to get 400,000.

27:23.744 --> 27:25.311
But that's an evaluation
of the merits,

27:25.345 --> 27:26.947
which is the jury's function.

27:26.980 --> 27:28.815
The jury blew it.

27:30.250 --> 27:35.889
Okay, but to go from
$72 million to 400--

27:35.922 --> 27:37.958
I mean, if I could
prevail upon you

27:37.991 --> 27:39.459
to revise
the knockdown number,

27:39.492 --> 27:41.061
I could certainly prevail
upon the client

27:41.094 --> 27:42.328
to pull back
on their complaint.

27:42.362 --> 27:45.398
The client isn't pushing this.

27:45.431 --> 27:47.100
Ellenor Frutt is
the driving force here.

27:47.133 --> 27:48.769
Don't you think I know that?

27:48.802 --> 27:51.437
Well, here's something
she should know.

27:51.471 --> 27:53.406
I have life tenure.

27:53.439 --> 27:55.909
I will be here a long, long time

27:55.942 --> 27:57.310
with a vivid memory,

27:57.343 --> 27:59.145
and you people
will not intimidate me.

27:59.179 --> 28:00.814
We're not looking to do that.

28:00.847 --> 28:02.482
Tell Ms. Frutt
I'm issuing a gag order

28:02.516 --> 28:04.417
in connection with this case.

28:04.450 --> 28:07.187
If she says one word
to the press,
she's in contempt.

28:07.220 --> 28:08.922
And if she snorts out

28:08.955 --> 28:10.857
a single negative utterance
about me to anybody,

28:10.891 --> 28:13.927
I will refer her to
the federal disciplinary panel

28:13.960 --> 28:16.462
for violating the court rules
of disparaging a judge.

28:16.496 --> 28:19.232
If she wants a fight,
she's got one.

28:19.265 --> 28:22.803
You go tell her that,
Ms. Dole.

28:32.012 --> 28:34.480
Richard, did you have
the Wallace file

28:34.515 --> 28:36.049
removed from my office?

28:36.082 --> 28:37.518
They're working
on an appeal, Helen.

28:37.551 --> 28:39.152
Certainly you don't expect
to be handling it.

28:39.185 --> 28:40.521
Why didn't you just
ask for the file?

28:40.554 --> 28:42.523
I couldn't presume
your cooperation.

28:42.556 --> 28:44.791
For all I know, you might make
copies of our work product

28:44.825 --> 28:46.292
and hand them
to the defendant.

28:46.326 --> 28:49.495
Look, I think you know
in your head

28:49.530 --> 28:52.999
what I did wasn't personal,
and what you're doing now is.

28:53.033 --> 28:55.001
You act on your principles,
Helen.

28:55.035 --> 28:56.970
I'll act on mine.

28:57.003 --> 28:59.439
My principle was justice,
Richard. Yours is politics.

28:59.472 --> 29:01.107
Politics?

29:01.141 --> 29:03.109
I know what's going on,
Richard.

29:03.143 --> 29:04.545
I still have ears.

29:04.578 --> 29:07.113
Suddenly, I'm a pariah
in the department,

29:07.147 --> 29:09.983
and you're choosing
to distance yourself.

29:10.016 --> 29:11.985
That's fine,
but let's not forget

29:12.018 --> 29:14.354
your career was hanging
by a thread a few months ago,

29:14.387 --> 29:17.357
and I'm the one who stood
with you and behind you.

29:17.390 --> 29:20.326
Now the idea that
the association with me
could be detrimental,

29:20.360 --> 29:22.796
you run.

29:22.829 --> 29:24.798
You're a hypocrite
and a coward.

29:24.831 --> 29:27.801
Please do take that
personally.

29:34.240 --> 29:36.076
So you lied to me?

29:36.109 --> 29:38.044
I didn't lie, but--

29:38.078 --> 29:40.881
I stand a good chance
of getting this case dismissed.

29:40.914 --> 29:42.549
Yes.

29:42.583 --> 29:43.850
You lied to me.

29:43.884 --> 29:45.586
Jennifer...

29:45.619 --> 29:48.188
I'm just trying
to keep you safe

29:48.221 --> 29:50.190
until the baby is born.

29:50.223 --> 29:52.192
You're still using,
for God's sake.

29:52.225 --> 29:54.094
So what happens now?

29:54.127 --> 29:56.963
We go back in
before Judge Spindle
this afternoon.

29:56.997 --> 29:58.098
She might bind you over
for trial.

29:58.131 --> 29:59.533
She might kick the case,

29:59.566 --> 30:01.401
depending on how convincing
the D. A. is.

30:01.434 --> 30:03.269
I want another lawyer.

30:03.303 --> 30:05.038
If you want me to beat it,
I'll try--

30:05.071 --> 30:07.608
I want another lawyer.
Can I get a public defender?

30:07.641 --> 30:11.077
-I'm sure you could--
-Then that's what I want.
You're fired, Jimmy.

30:11.111 --> 30:13.146
-Please leave.
-Jennifer.

30:13.179 --> 30:14.981
You're fired.

30:18.885 --> 30:20.954
You're going
to wind up dead

30:20.987 --> 30:23.289
or killing your baby.

30:26.259 --> 30:28.161
Guard!

30:51.084 --> 30:53.887
And he said
if we opted for a new trial,

30:53.920 --> 30:57.991
he would probably remit
the next award to 75,000.

30:58.024 --> 31:00.126
He was clearly threatening
to punish us

31:00.160 --> 31:03.029
if we exercised
our legal rights.

31:03.063 --> 31:06.667
Ms. Frutt, judges try
to steer lawyers all the time.

31:06.700 --> 31:09.936
This was much more
than steering.

31:09.970 --> 31:11.938
It was a threat.

31:11.972 --> 31:13.406
May I respond to that?

31:13.439 --> 31:14.941
Please do.

31:14.975 --> 31:17.477
If I was guilty
of poor judgment,

31:17.511 --> 31:19.479
it was in allowing any award.

31:19.513 --> 31:22.048
For me, 75 was too high,

31:22.082 --> 31:25.418
but when you're sitting
in front of sympathetic parents

31:25.451 --> 31:27.988
who've gone through the ordeal
of a long trial,

31:28.021 --> 31:30.056
in the wake of a jury verdict,

31:30.090 --> 31:32.959
I didn't want them
to walk away empty-handed.

31:32.993 --> 31:36.329
That's why I gave them the 135.

31:36.362 --> 31:38.699
I let Ms. Frutt know
she shouldn't bank

31:38.732 --> 31:41.401
on my continued sense
of charity.

31:41.434 --> 31:44.505
You chipped
a $72 million award

31:44.538 --> 31:48.241
down to $400,000
out of a sense of charity?

31:48.274 --> 31:50.711
I allowed you to keep
the 400

31:50.744 --> 31:55.015
on a claim that was really
worth nothing.

31:55.048 --> 31:57.551
MS. ALEXANDER: We've certainly
allowed murder charges to stand

31:57.584 --> 31:59.152
against people who cause

31:59.185 --> 32:01.154
the death of unborn
viable fetuses.

32:01.187 --> 32:03.557
But those are third parties,
not the mother.

32:03.590 --> 32:05.559
Moreover,
for drug distribution,

32:05.592 --> 32:07.427
you have to establish
a specific intent,

32:07.460 --> 32:09.029
and there's been
no showing of that.

32:09.062 --> 32:10.997
Specific intent can be inferred.

32:11.031 --> 32:12.432
Are you suggesting
she intended

32:12.465 --> 32:14.167
to poison the fetus
with cocaine?

32:14.200 --> 32:15.736
All I'm suggesting is
that if you commit an act

32:15.769 --> 32:18.271
that causes a result
that is not only foreseeable,

32:18.304 --> 32:20.541
but, in fact, unavoidable,
intent can be inferred.

32:20.574 --> 32:23.109
I'm sorry, Ms. Alexander,
but I have to consider

32:23.143 --> 32:26.446
the legislative intent,
and there is no evidence

32:26.479 --> 32:29.082
that the drug distribution
laws were ever meant

32:29.115 --> 32:31.417
to apply to pregnant mothers
under this fact pattern.

32:31.451 --> 32:34.020
There's no evidence
to disprove the legislative--

32:34.054 --> 32:36.289
Ambiguity cuts in favor
of the defendant.

32:36.322 --> 32:38.491
All I'm asking is
that you bind her over.

32:38.525 --> 32:39.492
Let's just hold her--

32:39.526 --> 32:42.062
I can't do that.

32:42.095 --> 32:44.464
In the alternative,
I'd like to continue
this matter.

32:44.497 --> 32:46.032
Allow me to do
further research.

32:46.066 --> 32:47.768
Denied.
The charges against Ms. Cole

32:47.801 --> 32:49.235
are dismissed.

32:49.269 --> 32:52.072
This time, I am doing so
with prejudice.

32:52.105 --> 32:54.074
The defendant is free to go.

32:54.107 --> 32:57.010
We are adjourned.

33:00.446 --> 33:03.650
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

33:08.789 --> 33:10.757
-Let's go.
-Go where?

33:10.791 --> 33:12.793
Rehab. Everything's set up.

33:12.826 --> 33:15.061
I'm not going anywhere
with you, Jimmy.

33:15.095 --> 33:17.097
Jennifer, you have a problem.

33:17.130 --> 33:18.532
Whatever my problems are,

33:18.565 --> 33:20.801
I'm not about to come
to you with them.

33:20.834 --> 33:22.035
Bye.

33:27.808 --> 33:29.375
You people hardly have

33:29.409 --> 33:31.244
an unblemished track record,
Ms. Frutt.

33:31.277 --> 33:33.079
In fact, I might go
so far as to say

33:33.113 --> 33:35.582
you have a penchant
for deceit.

33:35.616 --> 33:38.451
Whatever you may think
of our penchants,

33:38.484 --> 33:40.453
we have always played
by the rules.

33:40.486 --> 33:44.457
He didn't.
It was cowboy justice.

33:44.490 --> 33:46.459
I have to say,
as I see the facts,

33:46.492 --> 33:48.261
most judges
wouldn't have let this

33:48.294 --> 33:49.663
even go to trial.

33:49.696 --> 33:51.798
Your Honor,
we were in that room.

33:51.832 --> 33:53.399
We heard what he said

33:53.433 --> 33:55.468
and the tenor
of how he said it.

33:55.501 --> 33:57.270
It was blackmail.

33:57.303 --> 33:59.472
He took away
our seventh amendment right

33:59.506 --> 34:01.407
to a jury trial,
and then he threatened us

34:01.441 --> 34:03.343
if we dared appeal.

34:03.376 --> 34:05.646
That's not the way
it's supposed to work.

34:05.679 --> 34:07.548
I know Judge Aldrich.

34:07.581 --> 34:09.815
I've known him for 20 years.

34:09.850 --> 34:11.818
I'd sooner take his word

34:11.851 --> 34:14.154
than that of a few
criminal defense attorneys

34:14.187 --> 34:16.156
who moonlight
with contingent-fee cases.

34:16.188 --> 34:18.224
I object to that.

34:18.257 --> 34:22.128
Do you have
anything else, Counsel?

34:32.706 --> 34:34.306
Yes, Your Honor,

34:34.340 --> 34:38.411
I'd like to call
Mitchell Kravitz.

34:38.444 --> 34:39.612
What are you doing?

34:39.646 --> 34:41.347
I have no idea.

34:41.380 --> 34:43.149
JUDGE WALTERS:
Mr. Kravitz,

34:43.183 --> 34:47.120
please come forward
and be sworn in.

34:50.891 --> 34:53.860
Please raise your right hand.

34:53.893 --> 34:55.896
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

34:55.929 --> 34:58.532
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

34:58.565 --> 35:00.701
-I do.
-What are you going
to ask him?

35:00.734 --> 35:02.335
I don't know.

35:02.368 --> 35:04.204
You ask him something.

35:04.237 --> 35:06.773
Okay, Ms. Frutt,
you may question Mr. Kravitz.

35:09.375 --> 35:13.213
Sir, you were
in Judge Aldrich's chambers

35:13.246 --> 35:14.615
the day in question

35:14.648 --> 35:16.349
for the transaction
in question

35:16.382 --> 35:18.484
in your capacity
as defense counsel

35:18.519 --> 35:21.454
for the environmental
protection agency, true?

35:21.487 --> 35:23.289
True.

35:23.323 --> 35:24.658
You've been sitting here

35:24.691 --> 35:27.227
listening to my version
of what happened

35:27.260 --> 35:29.395
and to the one offered
by Judge Aldrich.

35:29.429 --> 35:32.498
Do you have an opinion
as to which version

35:32.533 --> 35:34.635
is more accurate?

35:34.668 --> 35:37.904
Given that I participated
in this transaction

35:37.938 --> 35:39.405
as an attorney,

35:39.439 --> 35:41.241
I don't feel
it's appropriate for me

35:41.274 --> 35:42.909
to also bear witness
on the events.

35:42.943 --> 35:45.912
We have had a judge
bearing witness, sir.

35:45.946 --> 35:48.481
It's okay
if you do so, as well.

35:48.515 --> 35:49.950
Your Honor,
I represent clients.

35:49.983 --> 35:52.385
I have a duty
to those clients--

35:52.418 --> 35:54.487
This is a hearing
about the conduct

35:54.521 --> 35:56.322
of the officers
of the court.

35:56.356 --> 35:58.592
It does not concern
the interests of clients.

35:58.625 --> 36:00.961
Certainly, if it affects
the interests of clients,

36:00.994 --> 36:03.263
I can't be compelled
to testify.

36:03.296 --> 36:05.431
I want to know what went on
in that room, sir.

36:05.465 --> 36:07.968
You heard Judge Aldrich
a short time ago.

36:08.001 --> 36:12.539
We have all been listening
ad nauseam to Ms. Frutt.

36:12.573 --> 36:15.542
Whose testimony today
more accurately reflects

36:15.576 --> 36:19.179
what went on
in that room?

36:21.381 --> 36:26.520
The court has asked you
a question, Mr. Kravitz.

36:26.553 --> 36:29.756
I believe the truth lies
somewhere in the middle.

36:29.790 --> 36:34.761
On whose side of the middle
does the truth lie?

36:46.339 --> 36:48.441
Ms. Frutt.

36:48.474 --> 36:50.744
Oh, my God.

36:52.779 --> 36:56.282
You believe
Judge Aldrich was guilty

36:56.316 --> 36:59.285
of judicial misconduct?

36:59.319 --> 37:02.322
I asked you a question, Counsel.

37:02.355 --> 37:04.658
Do you believe
Judge Aldrich was guilty

37:04.691 --> 37:06.660
of judicial misconduct?

37:06.693 --> 37:12.398
I think he conducted
a fair trial...

37:12.432 --> 37:15.301
but what happened
in his chambers

37:15.335 --> 37:17.504
after the verdict--

37:17.538 --> 37:21.508
While it wasn't
blatant blackmail,

37:21.542 --> 37:25.478
it was definitely...
coercion.

37:25.512 --> 37:28.314
May I respond to that?

37:28.348 --> 37:29.616
Go ahead.

37:29.650 --> 37:32.352
I strongly disagree

37:32.385 --> 37:34.320
with Mr. Kravitz's
characterization.

37:34.354 --> 37:36.790
Let's remember,
he was in the throes

37:36.823 --> 37:39.893
of being smacked
with a $72 million judgment.

37:39.926 --> 37:43.329
His career was probably
flashing before his eyes.

37:43.363 --> 37:45.532
I resent that.

37:45.566 --> 37:47.801
I have the floor now,
Counsel.

37:47.834 --> 37:51.037
His powers of observation
may have been on tilt.

37:51.071 --> 37:53.039
But surely not biased,

37:53.073 --> 37:55.441
not against a judge
ruling in his favor.

37:55.475 --> 37:57.878
Let me say, also,

37:57.911 --> 38:02.516
a judge, every single day,
exercises some coercion.

38:02.549 --> 38:05.451
Our dockets are jammed
beyond repair

38:05.485 --> 38:06.820
with claims that have
no real merit.

38:06.853 --> 38:08.555
This was one such claim.

38:08.589 --> 38:11.625
We push, steer,

38:11.658 --> 38:14.828
bend, influence,
and, yes, coerce.

38:14.861 --> 38:16.663
We do it every day.

38:16.697 --> 38:18.665
If we didn't,
God help the mess,

38:18.699 --> 38:20.667
not to mention the injustice.

38:20.701 --> 38:23.403
The line is a gray one.

38:23.436 --> 38:26.907
I submit to you
I did not cross it here.

38:26.940 --> 38:29.409
The facts underlying this case

38:29.442 --> 38:33.747
did not justify
a $72 million verdict.

38:33.780 --> 38:36.817
I was there at the trial.
I heard the evidence.

38:36.850 --> 38:39.419
This panel did not.

38:39.452 --> 38:42.088
There was no abuse
of my discretion.

38:42.122 --> 38:46.593
The knockdown number was fair.

39:13.554 --> 39:16.523
The knockdown number
is knocked out.

39:16.557 --> 39:20.527
The award of $72 million
is reinstated.

39:20.561 --> 39:22.696
Defense is free to bring
a new motion to remit

39:22.729 --> 39:24.865
once the case has been
reassigned.

39:24.898 --> 39:27.033
We are adjourned.

39:33.507 --> 39:35.008
ELLENOR:
I thought I'd seen everything.

39:35.041 --> 39:36.943
LINDSAY: Me too.

39:42.649 --> 39:45.018
I'm afraid to celebrate.

39:45.051 --> 39:46.720
Very wise.

39:46.753 --> 39:48.722
The 72 will still
get chopped down.

39:48.755 --> 39:50.557
We're going
to do some research

39:50.591 --> 39:52.826
and come up with a number
to try and settle.

39:52.859 --> 39:54.761
Okay.

39:54.795 --> 39:56.396
Wow.

39:58.599 --> 40:01.968
Yeah.

40:16.983 --> 40:19.185
Josh.

40:19.219 --> 40:22.656
Jimmy.

40:22.689 --> 40:25.659
I shouldn't be talking
to you-- Doctor/patient.

40:25.692 --> 40:27.193
Yeah. Yeah.

40:27.227 --> 40:29.930
Partial placental abruption.

40:29.963 --> 40:31.598
Placental lining
started to come loose

40:31.632 --> 40:32.866
from the uterine wall.

40:32.899 --> 40:34.034
Coke?

40:34.067 --> 40:35.602
She started bleeding,

40:35.636 --> 40:37.037
had enough sense
to call E. M. S.,

40:37.070 --> 40:39.039
went into shock.

40:39.072 --> 40:40.541
The baby?

40:40.574 --> 40:41.708
We delivered--

40:41.742 --> 40:44.545
Little girl,
3 1/2 pounds.

40:44.578 --> 40:46.513
She all right?

40:46.547 --> 40:48.214
It's too early to tell.

40:48.248 --> 40:50.684
She lost oxygen
because of the abruption.

40:50.717 --> 40:52.052
We're going to do
a cranial ultrasound,

40:52.085 --> 40:53.520
check for a stroke,

40:53.554 --> 40:55.522
and there was cocaine
in her body,

40:55.556 --> 40:57.123
some agitation,
maybe withdrawal.

40:59.259 --> 41:03.129
We had to notify
social services.

41:35.161 --> 41:38.264
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

41:38.298 --> 41:42.268
You just rest.

41:42.302 --> 41:45.105
They won't let me see her?

41:45.138 --> 41:49.776
Later.

41:53.980 --> 41:56.116
Is she okay?

41:56.149 --> 42:00.554
We don't know yet.
The doctors are hoping.

42:05.726 --> 42:08.829
They're going to take her
away from me,

42:08.862 --> 42:10.731
won't they?

42:14.801 --> 42:18.138
It's too soon
to know anything, Jennifer.

42:18.171 --> 42:22.008
Just try to get some rest.

42:22.042 --> 42:27.714
Don't let them
take her away, okay?

42:35.656 --> 42:36.823
Okay.

44:11.151 --> 44:12.185
You stinker!
