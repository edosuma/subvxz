WEBVTT

00:03.237 --> 00:05.005
I'm from
BlueBell, Alabama.

00:05.005 --> 00:06.607
I'd like to offer you a job.

00:06.607 --> 00:08.609
What do you mean I didn't get
the cardiothoracic fellowship?

00:08.609 --> 00:10.411
If you want my recommendation
next year,

00:10.411 --> 00:12.813
spend the next 12 months
as a general practitioner.

00:12.813 --> 00:13.814
ZOE:
 Dr. Wilkes,

00:13.814 --> 00:14.648
you win.

00:14.648 --> 00:15.516
I'm on my way.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.518
CANDACE:
 Harley passed away.

00:17.518 --> 00:18.219
What?

00:18.219 --> 00:20.221
He left you his practice.

00:20.221 --> 00:21.655
I'm, uh, George Tucker.

00:21.655 --> 00:22.556
Zoe.

00:22.556 --> 00:24.192
Small towns have
their perks, huh?

00:24.192 --> 00:26.360
EMMELINE:
 Zoe, this is Lemon Breeland.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.996
Thanks to you, my fiancé
was in a car accident.

00:28.996 --> 00:30.398
Have you never heard
of bedside manner?!

00:30.398 --> 00:32.066
Why is everyone
so obsessed with that?

00:32.066 --> 00:33.267
Because it's nice!

00:33.267 --> 00:35.002
How dare you see my patients.

00:35.002 --> 00:37.838
Well, technically, Harley left
his half of the practice to me.

00:37.838 --> 00:38.806
You're the mayor?

00:38.806 --> 00:40.541
Lavon Hayes, the linebacker.

00:40.541 --> 00:43.111
You share a generator
with the guy in the gatehouse,

00:43.111 --> 00:44.278
Wade Kinsella.

00:44.278 --> 00:46.114
I don't want you
getting any ideas.

00:46.114 --> 00:47.748
LEMON:
 You here on a date with that,

00:47.748 --> 00:48.749
uh, Dr. Hart?

00:48.749 --> 00:49.983
If I do recall, we are

00:49.983 --> 00:51.985
at your engagement party.

00:51.985 --> 00:53.121
ZOE:
 That's my mom.

00:53.121 --> 00:54.655
Harley Wilkes was your father.

00:58.726 --> 00:59.727
(flatline tone)

00:59.727 --> 01:01.162
He's crashing. Paddles?

01:01.862 --> 01:03.231
(electrical whine)

01:03.231 --> 01:04.598
Unsynchronized at 200.

01:04.598 --> 01:05.266
Clear.

01:05.266 --> 01:06.600
(paddles thudding)

01:06.600 --> 01:08.068
300!

01:08.068 --> 01:09.069
Clear!

01:09.069 --> 01:10.104
(paddles thudding)

01:10.104 --> 01:11.972
(flatline tone)

01:11.972 --> 01:14.608
(monitor beeping steadily)

01:14.608 --> 01:16.110
(frog croaking)

01:16.110 --> 01:18.078
(frog croaks, Zoe screams)

01:19.613 --> 01:21.615
(groans)

01:24.152 --> 01:27.621
(sighs):
BlueBell, Alabama.

01:27.621 --> 01:28.789
Right.

01:28.789 --> 01:31.225
(croaks)

01:45.273 --> 01:47.375
WOMAN:
 She's set up shop

01:47.375 --> 01:49.410
in Harley Wilkes'
old office.

01:49.410 --> 01:52.045
She's been seen all over
town with the mayor.

01:52.045 --> 01:53.547
Brick's furious.

01:53.547 --> 01:57.651
They say she's Harley's
illegitimate love child.

01:57.651 --> 02:01.422
Well, that explains
those shorts.

02:04.292 --> 02:06.294
ZOE: Are you sure they're
not talking about me?

02:06.294 --> 02:08.329
Of course not.

02:08.329 --> 02:11.332
So, um, Harley
was your father?

02:11.332 --> 02:14.502
Man, I did not
see that one coming.

02:14.502 --> 02:16.437
I know.
It's all so surreal.

02:16.437 --> 02:18.606
Me being here
must be a sign.

02:18.606 --> 02:20.007
Hmm.

02:20.007 --> 02:22.176
And do you believe in signs?

02:22.176 --> 02:25.112
I believe that Harley was
my dad, my real dad,

02:25.112 --> 02:28.582
and I owe it to myself the
year to figure out who he was,

02:28.582 --> 02:30.818
walk a mile
in his shoes.

02:30.818 --> 02:34.488
Which should take me around
BlueBell about 11 times.

02:34.488 --> 02:38.859
Oh, now, as the mayor of this
town, Lavon Hayes takes offense.

02:38.859 --> 02:41.395
But as the co-chair
of the tourism counsel,

02:41.395 --> 02:44.398
I will ignore it to tell you
that any journey

02:44.398 --> 02:46.200
on the eastern shore

02:46.200 --> 02:48.068
begins at the Rammer
Jammer. (chuckles)

02:48.068 --> 02:51.171
Home of the best po' boy
this side of Mobile Bay.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.740
You in?

02:52.740 --> 02:55.175
I'm here; might as well
make the most of it.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.077
Lead me to
your people.
All right.

02:57.077 --> 02:58.412
(country music playing)

02:58.412 --> 03:01.114
Never met a New Yorker before.

03:01.114 --> 03:02.350
Do you know Regis?

03:02.350 --> 03:04.785
Tom, don't be such a plebe.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.086
(chuckles)

03:06.086 --> 03:07.721
Zoe...

03:07.721 --> 03:09.189
I'm Dash DeWitt.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.624
(chuckles)

03:10.624 --> 03:13.461
You know, I do a theatre trip
every April.

03:13.461 --> 03:14.928
The Book of Mormon

03:14.928 --> 03:16.530
sent me over the moon and back.

03:16.530 --> 03:17.365
Oh.

03:17.365 --> 03:18.632
So, what's your deal?

03:18.632 --> 03:20.200
You married?
Got a boyfriend?

03:20.200 --> 03:21.669
You looking?

03:21.669 --> 03:26.039
Uh, Shelly, we'll take
two number fives with grits.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.174
Thank you.

03:27.174 --> 03:28.409
Mmm.

03:28.409 --> 03:29.943
BRICK:
 She is Harley's daughter?

03:29.943 --> 03:31.144
Apparently so.

03:31.144 --> 03:32.780
And, as your lawyer,
I can't much see

03:32.780 --> 03:34.582
how you can
contest his will now.

03:34.582 --> 03:36.817
But, George, there must be
something that you can do.

03:36.817 --> 03:39.186
I mean, Daddy has waited
a long time

03:39.186 --> 03:40.854
to have this practice
all to himself.

03:40.854 --> 03:41.855
He's earned it.

03:41.855 --> 03:44.592
Look, Brick,
she's a trained surgeon.

03:44.592 --> 03:46.126
Okay? She might
be useful.

03:46.126 --> 03:47.495
Useful?

03:47.495 --> 03:49.630
Looks like she's spent
more time at the mall

03:49.630 --> 03:51.031
than she has at a hospital.

03:51.031 --> 03:52.466
(laughs)

03:52.466 --> 03:54.635
Now, I do admit that, you know,
delivering that baby,

03:54.635 --> 03:59.473
that took some skill, but
she doesn't understand our ways.

03:59.473 --> 04:01.675
She's more nuisance
than useful down here.

04:01.675 --> 04:04.545
Well, it doesn't look like
you have much of a choice.

04:04.545 --> 04:06.614
So maybe y'all could
give her a chance?

04:06.614 --> 04:07.815
LEMON:
Oh, George, sweetheart,

04:07.815 --> 04:10.384
you just like
everybody, don't you?

04:10.384 --> 04:13.354
Well, BlueBell isn't
an animal shelter,

04:13.354 --> 04:14.522
and we don't have to accept

04:14.522 --> 04:16.524
every little stray
that comes our way.

04:16.524 --> 04:19.091
Now, I have dance rehearsal
for the parade.

04:19.091 --> 04:22.396
And I'm sure that you
two strapping men can figure out

04:22.396 --> 04:25.833
how to chase away
one yippy little mongrel.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.001
And I love you.

04:28.001 --> 04:29.002
I love you, too.

04:29.002 --> 04:30.003
All right, baby.

04:30.003 --> 04:31.339
Bye, sugar.

04:31.339 --> 04:33.273
Bye, Daddy.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.544
I want you to comb through

04:36.544 --> 04:40.280
that partnership agreement
with Harley.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.015
Find me a way.

04:43.050 --> 04:45.052
Okay.

04:47.154 --> 04:50.090
* *

04:50.090 --> 04:54.027
Exactly what I thought
grits would taste like.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.262
Delicious!

04:55.262 --> 04:58.298
I'm gonna fit
right in with...

04:58.298 --> 05:00.133
(laughter)

05:00.133 --> 05:01.569
...the traveling circus?

05:01.569 --> 05:02.670
Oh-ho! (laughing)

05:02.670 --> 05:03.971
(laughs)

05:03.971 --> 05:06.440
This Saturday is
the Founder's Day parade.

05:06.440 --> 05:07.808
My favorite event of the year.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.910
You were in the NFL
for ten years,

05:09.910 --> 05:11.579
and the Founder's Day parade
is your favorite event?

05:11.579 --> 05:13.280
The mayor gets to ride
on the best float

05:13.280 --> 05:15.082
and deliver a speech.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.419
Wade, my boy.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.454
How's the float coming?

05:20.454 --> 05:23.557
I'm just putting on
the finishing touches.

05:24.858 --> 05:25.693
So, Doc,

05:25.693 --> 05:28.429
hear you're staying in town.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.330
You ever need a cup of sugar,

05:30.330 --> 05:31.965
anything,
I'll be right next door.

05:31.965 --> 05:35.703
If that line ever works for you,
you tell that poor girl

05:35.703 --> 05:38.472
to come see me at my office, so
I can dispense the penicillin.

05:38.472 --> 05:39.773
Sure thing.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.576
CANDACE:
 Oh, come on.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.077
What are you on,
some kind of cleanse?

05:44.077 --> 05:45.979
I'm just asking you to
try one damn sugar snap.

05:45.979 --> 05:48.882
Mrs. H, I already ate
the caramel one, the sugar,

05:48.882 --> 05:50.751
the chocolate chocolate chip
with sea salt...

05:50.751 --> 05:52.386
But it's not even 9:00 a.m.,

05:52.386 --> 05:54.888
and I don't think meeting
new patients with a sugar high

05:54.888 --> 05:57.525
is the best way to follow
in Harley's footsteps.

05:58.692 --> 06:02.763
Harley's footsteps.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.432
Magic words.

06:04.432 --> 06:07.100
I have something
for you.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.937
Harley's old patient files.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.204
Hmm?

06:11.204 --> 06:13.407
You should study them.

06:13.407 --> 06:17.210
He was a great doctor,
pillar of the community.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.447
Really listened to people,

06:19.447 --> 06:21.381
heard their problems,
wrote down everything...

06:21.381 --> 06:22.750
He treated warts
with duct tape?

06:22.750 --> 06:25.352
Sometimes the old ways
are the best ways.

06:25.352 --> 06:27.921
(door opens, bell jingles)

06:27.921 --> 06:29.056
We are open.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.390
Oh.

06:32.192 --> 06:34.094
Welcome, everyone.

06:34.094 --> 06:35.829
I'm Dr. Zoe Hart.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.397
Very excited to meet you all

06:37.397 --> 06:38.999
and offer my services.

06:38.999 --> 06:42.870
Oh, you poor deluded thing,
no one is here to see you.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.638
I mean, I've been the only

06:44.638 --> 06:46.640
town doctor here
for the last four months,

06:46.640 --> 06:49.409
and the people of BlueBell
are loyal.

06:49.409 --> 06:53.180
Have I mentioned that I'm
Dr. Harley Wilkes' daughter?

06:53.180 --> 06:54.582
I'm like a
townie by blood.

06:54.582 --> 06:57.050
It is a shame
your father passed,

06:57.050 --> 06:59.720
but the people have
recovered quick.

06:59.720 --> 07:02.355
Mainly, because there was
a better doctor here

07:02.355 --> 07:04.157
to help heal them.

07:05.893 --> 07:07.360
But, you know what,
I'm a good Christian,

07:07.360 --> 07:09.763
so I'm gonna let you treat
Shula Whitaker today.

07:09.763 --> 07:10.731
She, uh,

07:10.731 --> 07:12.866
she is one of
Harley's regulars.

07:14.768 --> 07:18.338
Hmm, well, one patient
is all I need.

07:18.338 --> 07:21.542
Ms. Whitaker,
please come this way.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.514
Besides the-the chills

07:26.514 --> 07:29.483
and the aching limbs
and the swollen glands,

07:29.483 --> 07:31.619
it's hard to pee.

07:31.619 --> 07:32.953
Well, you don't have a fever.

07:32.953 --> 07:33.821
It broke.

07:33.821 --> 07:35.623
But I had a high one yesterday.

07:35.623 --> 07:37.725
Like, ooh, off the charts!

07:39.226 --> 07:42.129
Have you noticed any black spots
on your body?

07:42.129 --> 07:43.230
Yes!

07:43.230 --> 07:44.364
I was covered.

07:44.364 --> 07:46.800
Like a, like a Dalmatian.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.536
But they went away
after the fever broke.

07:48.536 --> 07:50.103
Ms. Whitaker,

07:50.103 --> 07:54.341
according to Harley's nearly
Webster's-long file on you

07:54.341 --> 07:57.244
and the fact that you are
presenting with symptoms

07:57.244 --> 07:59.513
that are only consistent
with the black plague,

07:59.513 --> 08:01.549
I posit that you are
perfectly healthy.

08:01.549 --> 08:02.783
And suggest

08:02.783 --> 08:04.151
you see a psychologist.

08:05.953 --> 08:08.722
I heard you was
Harley's daughter.

08:10.290 --> 08:13.561
And I thought...

08:13.561 --> 08:15.629
But I won't bother you no more.

08:21.535 --> 08:23.737
Did you even look at her file?

08:23.737 --> 08:27.541
Harley'd usually just give
her Tic Tacs as a placebo

08:27.541 --> 08:29.042
and ask her about her cats.

08:29.042 --> 08:31.612
I did a psychiatric rotation
at Bellevue.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.981
Harley giving her Tic Tacs
just enabled her.

08:33.981 --> 08:36.116
(sighs)

08:37.684 --> 08:39.820
LEMON:
 Ready?

08:39.820 --> 08:43.691
And one, two,
three, arm is up,

08:43.691 --> 08:45.292
one, two, three.

08:47.695 --> 08:49.296
ZOE:
Hey, Rose.

08:50.564 --> 08:53.400
Thank goodness you're staying!

08:53.400 --> 08:54.401
I know.

08:54.401 --> 08:56.837
I'm having the best time.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.138
I need your advice.

08:58.138 --> 08:59.873
'Cause my mother
does not get it,

08:59.873 --> 09:01.842
and all Aunt Emmeline
does is bake these days.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.176
Yeah, tell me about it.

09:03.176 --> 09:04.645
What's going on?

09:04.645 --> 09:06.614
Okay, well, there's this
boy-- Frederick Dean--

09:06.614 --> 09:07.681
in the grade above me.

09:07.681 --> 09:08.916
He's amazing.

09:08.916 --> 09:11.151
He likes history podcasts
and comic books.

09:11.151 --> 09:13.020
Though, he's also a
stupid Southern man,

09:13.020 --> 09:15.222
stuck in an antiquated
notion of the female ideal,

09:15.222 --> 09:17.524
which is why it seems
he hasn't noticed me.

09:17.524 --> 09:20.160
Oy, being 14
isn't easy for anyone.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.596
So what are you
going to do about it?

09:22.596 --> 09:24.765
That's where I
need your help.

09:24.765 --> 09:27.735
So, tell me, WWCBD?

09:27.735 --> 09:28.902
What would Carrie Bradshaw do?

09:28.902 --> 09:30.503
Seriously, if I knew,

09:30.503 --> 09:33.473
I would be married to Mr. Big,
living in a fantastic apartment

09:33.473 --> 09:35.508
in the great state
of Not Alabama.

09:35.508 --> 09:37.310
Don't ask my advice.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.880
I have liked the wrong
men since I can remember.

09:43.050 --> 09:46.319
I'll just go sit on
the other side of the square

09:46.319 --> 09:48.221
and try to read your lips.

09:50.057 --> 09:52.025
So, uh...

09:52.025 --> 09:53.026
Hi.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.496
This is awkward.

09:56.496 --> 09:58.431
Um, Brick asked me
to look for

09:58.431 --> 10:01.735
loopholes in his partnership
agreement with Harley.

10:01.735 --> 10:04.304
It's 25 years old,
so I hadn't seen it.

10:04.304 --> 10:07.107
But apparently,
if one partner doesn't bring in

10:07.107 --> 10:08.241
30% of the revenue

10:08.241 --> 10:10.744
every billing quarter,
the other partner

10:10.744 --> 10:13.480
can buy him or her out.

10:13.480 --> 10:15.615
30% of the business.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.084
Yeah.

10:17.084 --> 10:19.619
Don't worry.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.021
I'm good at what I do,

10:21.021 --> 10:23.223
and as soon as this town
figures that out,

10:23.223 --> 10:24.958
it'll be just fine.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.160
Okay.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.562
WOMAN:
Lemon!

10:29.562 --> 10:30.898
Where's your dad?

10:30.898 --> 10:33.366
It's Cole Maliska;
he's in the office.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.235
His legs
ain't working.

10:35.235 --> 10:36.336
I'll call my daddy.

10:36.336 --> 10:37.270
Okay.

10:37.270 --> 10:38.371
No need!

10:39.506 --> 10:41.775
I'm here!

10:41.775 --> 10:43.811
Uh, okay.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.149
WOMAN:
 What is it?

10:49.149 --> 10:51.084
What's wrong with my husband?

10:51.084 --> 10:53.353
Luckily, I've been able to rule
out stroke, but I am worried

10:53.353 --> 10:55.155
about what are concerning
neurological symptoms.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.524
Could be Guillain-Barré,
so I have an ambulance coming.

10:57.524 --> 10:58.658
Guillain-Barré?

10:58.658 --> 10:59.993
Is that serious?

10:59.993 --> 11:01.128
Yeah.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.597
Bedside manner.

11:04.597 --> 11:06.233
Sometimes people don't die.

11:07.367 --> 11:10.370
Cole? Ethel?

11:10.370 --> 11:11.604
What is going on here?

11:11.604 --> 11:13.606
Patient presented paralysis
in the lower extremities.

11:13.606 --> 11:16.409
I'm sending them to the hospital
for Guillain-Barré.

11:16.409 --> 11:19.212
Guillain-Barré.

11:19.212 --> 11:21.982
Well, it's deer
hunting season.

11:21.982 --> 11:26.720
And Cole is just suffering from
tick paralysis.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.588
Sometimes those little devils
get up in there

11:28.588 --> 11:30.991
and suddenly
you just can't move.

11:30.991 --> 11:33.761
Yeah. It's just like
how you get

11:33.761 --> 11:36.830
a little education in your head
and suddenly you can't think.

11:36.830 --> 11:37.998
(chuckles)

11:37.998 --> 11:39.566
He is going to be just fine.

11:39.566 --> 11:40.600
But she said...

11:40.600 --> 11:41.835
Oh, I know.
Poor little thing.

11:41.835 --> 11:43.837
She's from New York.

11:43.837 --> 11:46.206
She wouldn't know
a tick from a taxicab.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.707
(laughter)

11:51.644 --> 11:53.814
ZOE:
 Tick paralysis

11:53.814 --> 11:55.382
is very rare in
New York City.

11:55.382 --> 11:58.051
So rare that it
doesn't even happen.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.920
It was an innocent mistake.

11:59.920 --> 12:04.057
Still, not exactly
an auspicious beginning.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.859
Oh, it's a disaster!

12:06.994 --> 12:08.896
I wanted to follow
in my father's footsteps,

12:08.896 --> 12:10.597
but if I don't start
bringing patients in,

12:10.597 --> 12:14.067
I'm going to lose the practice
that Harley had for 45 years.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.837
Well, lucky for you,
you have me to give you counsel.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.338
You ready for it?

12:18.338 --> 12:19.739
Here it is.

12:19.739 --> 12:23.710
Key to success in BlueBell:
show people you're one of them.

12:23.710 --> 12:25.378
Harley always did.

12:25.378 --> 12:26.213
I ate grits.

12:26.213 --> 12:27.480
What more could a woman give?

12:27.480 --> 12:30.350
Join me on my float
in the parade tomorrow.

12:30.350 --> 12:34.988
Lavon Hayes has
a 99.8% approval rating.

12:34.988 --> 12:37.524
Only holdout I got
is the widow Lowman,

12:37.524 --> 12:39.692
who, for reasons
I don't like thinking about,

12:39.692 --> 12:41.561
wants me to
legalize prostitution.

12:41.561 --> 12:43.363
(both laugh)

12:43.363 --> 12:46.233
You show up on
Lavon Hayes's side,

12:46.233 --> 12:47.935
people will see
you want to fit in.

12:47.935 --> 12:49.236
They'll forgive you anything
if they see

12:49.236 --> 12:50.871
you trying to fit in
to this town.

12:50.871 --> 12:51.972
Really?
Yeah.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.340
All you have to do is

12:53.340 --> 12:55.608
help Wade with the finishing
touches on the float.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.044
(sighs)

12:57.044 --> 12:59.246
I guess I could do one parade.

12:59.246 --> 13:01.314
Get fitted for
your Alabama costume.

13:01.314 --> 13:02.482
A costume?

13:02.482 --> 13:05.118
BlueBell's very own
Alabama Yellowhammer.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.154
The people of this town
are going to be

13:07.154 --> 13:08.555
impressed by my medical skills,

13:08.555 --> 13:11.458
not by my parading around
in some ridiculous outfit.

13:11.458 --> 13:12.659
Mm-mm. No, not for me.

13:12.659 --> 13:14.461
I am not dressing up as a bird!

13:16.629 --> 13:18.899
Once again,

13:18.899 --> 13:20.733
no one came to see me.

13:20.733 --> 13:22.335
How did Harley get patients?

13:24.171 --> 13:26.940
Harley...

13:26.940 --> 13:29.009
was beloved.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.778
He'd deliver babies,
and they'd grow up

13:31.778 --> 13:35.182
and bring him their babies
and their babies' babies.

13:35.182 --> 13:38.018
He knew people's histories.

13:38.018 --> 13:40.420
Like the fact that
Cole Maliska was a hunter

13:40.420 --> 13:44.291
and that we've had four cases
of tick paralysis in BlueBell

13:44.291 --> 13:45.993
just this year.

13:45.993 --> 13:48.328
You want to look at
Harley's files again?

13:48.328 --> 13:49.329
Hmm?

13:49.329 --> 13:50.263
I could quiz you.

13:50.263 --> 13:51.798
I know Harley
was a great man,

13:51.798 --> 13:55.335
but we clearly have different
ways of approaching medicine.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.104
My, my, my.

13:57.104 --> 13:59.039
Interesting news about

13:59.039 --> 14:01.308
our partnership agreement,
right, Ms. Hart?

14:01.308 --> 14:04.444
Poor little thing-- 30%
is not gonna be an easy feat.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.713
You know,
I thought maybe I'd just

14:06.713 --> 14:08.281
turn this into my trophy room.

14:08.281 --> 14:11.451
Or I could just store
my shotgun collection in here.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.486
There you are, Daddy...

14:13.486 --> 14:14.854
Emmeline.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.856
Oh, my goodness,
Dr. Hart.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.492
You poor thing,
you look so tired.

14:19.492 --> 14:20.727
Sort of puffy-like.

14:20.727 --> 14:21.861
Thank you.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.064
BRICK:
Lemon meringue pie!

14:24.064 --> 14:26.633
Everything okay?
(groans)
Betty tripped

14:26.633 --> 14:28.435
during dance rehearsal.

14:28.435 --> 14:31.038
Oh, what happened, Bets?
Oh, you know me, Uncle Brick.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.505
I'm just so clumsy.

14:32.505 --> 14:34.908
I'm fine. There's no
need to bring me in.

14:34.908 --> 14:36.543
LEMON:
Of course there is.

14:36.543 --> 14:39.579
We need to make sure her arm's
okay for the parade tomorrow.

14:39.579 --> 14:41.781
Betty is Brick's niece
from Huntsville.

14:41.781 --> 14:43.183
She visits
every summer.

14:43.183 --> 14:46.819
Betty, this is Dr.
Hart from New York.

14:46.819 --> 14:49.422
Yes. I heard
all about you.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.925
Uh, Brick has a waiting room
full of patients,

14:51.925 --> 14:54.494
but I could take you
right now, if you like.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.366
(laughter)

14:59.366 --> 15:00.367
Daddy, stop.

15:00.367 --> 15:03.236
BRICK: Ladies, ladies,
let me take a look

15:03.236 --> 15:06.106
at that for you,
now, all right?
See you!

15:08.175 --> 15:10.077
Oh, hey, Doc,
I'm glad you're here.

15:10.077 --> 15:12.512
My head has just been
killing me today.

15:12.512 --> 15:13.780
So?

15:13.780 --> 15:15.215
So? So what
are you doing

15:15.215 --> 15:17.017
just sitting there?
Call the hospital.

15:17.017 --> 15:19.019
(laughing): I must
need brain surgery.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.220
(laughter)

15:20.220 --> 15:22.089
Okay, all right,
we don't get ticks

15:22.089 --> 15:23.957
in New York City, okay?

15:23.957 --> 15:26.226
Kind of like how you
guys don't get movies

15:26.226 --> 15:27.927
that aren't made
by Michael Bay.

15:27.927 --> 15:28.996
Whoa!
Oh!
Zinger!

15:28.996 --> 15:30.697
It was an innocent mistake!

15:30.697 --> 15:31.831
(laughter)

15:31.831 --> 15:33.967
Aw, come on,
sweetheart.

15:33.967 --> 15:37.004
(scattered chuckles)

15:37.004 --> 15:38.938
(country music playing)

15:38.938 --> 15:42.942
Lavon. Fine, if it's what I have
to do to fit in around here

15:42.942 --> 15:44.811
I'll join you
on your damn float.

15:44.811 --> 15:47.914
Just please don't make me
wear a bird costume.

15:47.914 --> 15:49.249
(low groan)

15:50.583 --> 15:52.019
Betty?

15:58.691 --> 15:59.959
Okay.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.761
Where... where am I?

16:01.761 --> 16:04.564
You're in the bathroom
at the Rammer Jammer.

16:07.234 --> 16:10.170
You can't let anyone
see me like this.

16:11.404 --> 16:13.106
Please...

16:14.441 --> 16:16.843
Frelp... blee...

16:16.843 --> 16:18.278
Betty. Betty?

16:24.184 --> 16:26.153
I told you, I'm fine.

16:26.153 --> 16:27.487
You spoke like a Martian,

16:27.487 --> 16:29.089
almost broke your head
on the linoleum--

16:29.089 --> 16:31.724
you are not fine,
young lady.

16:35.395 --> 16:37.730
Acute muscle weakness
in the left arm.

16:37.730 --> 16:40.233
You tripped yesterday,
which means loss of balance.

16:40.233 --> 16:43.236
Possibly muscle
spasticity.

16:43.236 --> 16:45.205
And the garbled speech.

16:45.205 --> 16:47.107
My guess is you're
in the middle

16:47.107 --> 16:49.509
of a degenerative
immune disorder episode.

16:51.511 --> 16:54.314
Found out last year.
(wry laugh)

16:54.314 --> 16:55.782
M.S.?

16:58.485 --> 16:59.552
Wow.

16:59.552 --> 17:01.921
That's unusual in
someone so young.

17:01.921 --> 17:04.124
Betty, I'm so sorry,
that must...

17:04.124 --> 17:06.393
Suck? Well, yes, it does.

17:06.393 --> 17:10.297
And that pitying look
you're giving me right now

17:10.297 --> 17:12.531
is exactly why no one
here can know about it.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.435
Betty, you're sick-- you can't
pretend like nothing's wrong.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.304
Oh, I can pretend whatever
I want; it's mybody.

17:17.304 --> 17:20.006
Besides, I watch television,
so I know about

17:20.006 --> 17:21.741
that doctor-patient
confidentiality thing.

17:21.741 --> 17:24.211
So you can't say
anything, either.

17:25.478 --> 17:28.013
Fine. I won't say anything

17:28.013 --> 17:30.517
if you promise to take
care of yourself.

17:30.517 --> 17:32.185
You have to rest--
which means

17:32.185 --> 17:34.154
you can't perform in
that parade tomorrow.

17:34.154 --> 17:36.923
Oh, but I-I have to.

17:36.923 --> 17:39.626
This is important.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.894
I've been rehearsing
for a month.

17:41.894 --> 17:45.632
The parade is the final
Belle event of the summer.

17:45.632 --> 17:46.766
(chuckles)

17:46.766 --> 17:48.301
Honey, Dr. Hart is right.

17:48.301 --> 17:51.204
The heat and the stress will
just exacerbate your symptoms.

17:51.204 --> 17:53.340
It's gonna be 96
degrees out, and if you

17:53.340 --> 17:56.109
pass out again, this time
it's from a moving platform.

17:57.043 --> 17:59.045
Lemon'll be furious.

17:59.045 --> 18:00.280
She'll ask questions...

18:00.280 --> 18:02.815
You tell Lemon that
you ran into Dr. Hart,

18:02.815 --> 18:06.319
who examined your shoulder and
found a glenoid labrum tear

18:06.319 --> 18:09.055
and insisted you
couldn't perform.

18:09.055 --> 18:10.590
You'd do that?

18:10.590 --> 18:12.559
EMMELINE: Why don't
you come on back

18:12.559 --> 18:16.229
to the office and I'll get you
a sling-- it'll help sell it.

18:16.229 --> 18:18.798
Thank you.

18:28.375 --> 18:30.577
That was some nice doctoring.

18:30.577 --> 18:34.046
And I hear you're riding in
the mayor's float tomorrow.

18:34.046 --> 18:36.483
Making improvements.

18:39.286 --> 18:41.188
LEMON:
All right, sweetheart,
so just remember,

18:41.188 --> 18:43.556
your foot has to be
steady on the gas,

18:43.556 --> 18:46.092
and the float must be going
exactly four miles an hour

18:46.092 --> 18:48.795
for the dancers
to time it just right.
Right, right.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.062
Six miles an hour.

18:50.062 --> 18:52.199
No, George...
Did you even hear me?

18:52.199 --> 18:53.466
Four miles an hour.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.468
Oh, I-I'm sorry,
I thought you said four.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.404
No, I didn't,
I said...

18:58.205 --> 19:00.006
Don't mock me.

19:00.006 --> 19:02.942
Come on, the Belles have
been practicing this dance

19:02.942 --> 19:04.177
for months now, honey.

19:04.177 --> 19:06.279
Yes, and I realize this
more than anyone.

19:06.279 --> 19:08.281
But, babe, you
got to remember,

19:08.281 --> 19:09.649
it's just one parade.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.684
Okay? And there will be
a million other events

19:11.684 --> 19:13.886
that you can take over
and perfect this month alone.

19:13.886 --> 19:16.823
Honey, the Belle float
has been the highlight
of Founder's Day

19:16.823 --> 19:18.925
for more than a hundred
years, and I just cannot

19:18.925 --> 19:20.460
let down all of BlueBell.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.629
Okay, and, you know,
your patriotism for BlueBell

19:22.629 --> 19:24.264
is getting a little freakish.

19:24.264 --> 19:25.465
George...
I'm just saying.

19:25.465 --> 19:27.500
But, you know,
I have a thing for freaks.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.370
I saw a circus once--
there was a girl with a tail,

19:30.370 --> 19:32.038
Mm-hmm.
I thought
it was so hot.

19:32.038 --> 19:33.273
(laughing)

19:34.106 --> 19:37.109
Oh, look--
it's Dr. Hart.

19:37.109 --> 19:39.279
Cute outfit.

19:39.279 --> 19:40.480
Have you joined a gang?

19:40.480 --> 19:43.182
Do you know where
Lavon's float is?

19:43.182 --> 19:44.717
You and the mayor

19:44.717 --> 19:47.220
have grown quite close
lately, haven't you?

19:47.220 --> 19:49.289
Uh, it's good
to see you helping out.

19:49.289 --> 19:51.291
And I think that Wade
could probably use a hand.

19:51.291 --> 19:52.525
He's right over there.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.628
Why does it bother
you so much that

19:55.628 --> 19:57.497
she's helping out
Lavon on his float?

19:57.497 --> 20:00.166
Just... riding
the mayor's float

20:00.166 --> 20:03.370
used to mean something
in this town.

20:07.507 --> 20:10.277
You've barely started!

20:10.277 --> 20:13.980
Mm. Well, I heard
I was getting a helper.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.048
I figured I'd wait.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.117
I do remember how capable

20:18.117 --> 20:19.719
those hands
of yours are.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.053
We just kissed!

20:21.053 --> 20:25.458
All I did with my hands was go--
why am I so stupid!

20:29.496 --> 20:32.499
Is this why you stopped our
little frolic the other night?

20:32.499 --> 20:34.834
You got googly eyes
for golden boy George?

20:34.834 --> 20:35.902
I stopped

20:35.902 --> 20:37.937
our little frolic
because I was half-crazed,

20:37.937 --> 20:40.673
full-drunk, and your breath
smelled like generic beer.

20:40.673 --> 20:43.510
Could we just build this
and get it over with?

20:43.510 --> 20:45.578
What is all this
chicken wire for?

20:45.578 --> 20:47.914
You never built
a float before?

20:47.914 --> 20:48.848
Is that surprising?

20:48.848 --> 20:51.851
Well... this is
what Lavon wants.

20:51.851 --> 20:56.022
It's a... a red wave,
an actual crimson tide.

20:56.022 --> 20:57.690
The mayor will surf it.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.559
I'm gonna run and
get some paint.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.828
Think you can handle that?

21:01.828 --> 21:03.830
* *

21:08.435 --> 21:10.370
ROSE:
There you are!

21:10.370 --> 21:12.339
You know something,
I have been looking

21:12.339 --> 21:13.573
everywhere for you.

21:13.573 --> 21:16.275
What are you doing
with that chicken wire?

21:16.275 --> 21:19.145
I didn't do a surgical rotation
in scrapbooking, okay?

21:19.145 --> 21:20.780
What's going on?

21:20.780 --> 21:24.183
Frederick Dean is
going to the parade
with Magnolia Breeland.

21:24.183 --> 21:25.785
Lemon's sister?

21:25.785 --> 21:27.186
Good grief!

21:27.186 --> 21:29.656
Which totally explains
why he hasn't noticed me.

21:29.656 --> 21:31.991
You want to get noticed?

21:31.991 --> 21:34.761
You should ride with us
on this float tomorrow.

21:34.761 --> 21:37.364
Apparently, it's the
key to legitimacy,

21:37.364 --> 21:39.732
popularity, even
success in this town.

21:39.732 --> 21:43.603
Me? Ride on the
mayor's float? OMG!

21:43.603 --> 21:46.839
There's one catch: you
have to help build it.

21:46.839 --> 21:48.975
Yeah.
That stupid Wade
disappeared

21:48.975 --> 21:51.444
three hours ago, and I have
no idea what I'm doing.

21:51.444 --> 21:52.979
Of course I'll help you.

21:52.979 --> 21:55.382
But I'm pretty sure
Wade's at his house.

21:55.382 --> 21:56.816
I heard music
coming from there

21:56.816 --> 21:59.452
when I went to
the carriage house
to find you.

21:59.452 --> 22:00.987
Really?
Mm-hmm.

22:00.987 --> 22:04.056
You start in on this;
I'll be right back.

22:04.056 --> 22:05.792
Okay.

22:05.792 --> 22:07.527
Okay.

22:12.932 --> 22:15.334
(phone ringing)

22:15.334 --> 22:17.069
Lavon Hayes.

22:17.069 --> 22:18.971
Lavon, it's Lemon.

22:18.971 --> 22:20.640
Lemon Breeland.

22:20.640 --> 22:23.275
Listen, I'll just cut
right to the chase.

22:23.275 --> 22:27.980
I hear that that Dr. Hart
is riding your float tomorrow.

22:27.980 --> 22:30.750
Your spies are correct.

22:30.750 --> 22:34.487
Well, I think that it is
highly inappropriate.

22:34.487 --> 22:35.888
(chuckles):
Inappropriate?

22:35.888 --> 22:37.757
It's disrespectful...
to my father,

22:37.757 --> 22:40.627
who has worked his butt off
for the people of BlueBell,

22:40.627 --> 22:44.831
for you to allow his competition
to be seen at your side.

22:46.833 --> 22:48.668
Now, listen,
I don't know or care

22:48.668 --> 22:50.737
what is going on
between you two, but...

22:50.737 --> 22:51.538
Lemon,

22:51.538 --> 22:53.305
I appreciate the call.

22:53.305 --> 22:57.877
If there's nothing else,
I got business to attend to.

22:59.979 --> 23:01.981
(doorbell rings)

23:01.981 --> 23:03.816
Coming!

23:05.752 --> 23:07.754
Oh, Lemon, you are not
gonna believe this!

23:07.754 --> 23:09.121
What are you doing here?

23:09.121 --> 23:11.458
What is wrong
with your arm?
I've just had

23:11.458 --> 23:12.659
a bit of bad news, really.

23:12.659 --> 23:14.393
You know, I ran
into that Dr. Hart

23:14.393 --> 23:16.195
who's so worried
about my shoulder.

23:16.195 --> 23:17.430
Turns out I have

23:17.430 --> 23:20.733
a torn glenoid ligament.

23:22.334 --> 23:24.571
She says I can't
perform tomorrow.

23:24.571 --> 23:26.038
Excuse me?
However,

23:26.038 --> 23:28.441
I've spent the whole day
training AnnaBeth,

23:28.441 --> 23:30.510
and she knows all
my dance moves,

23:30.510 --> 23:32.445
and she's ready
to step into my place.

23:33.980 --> 23:37.416
We... have been practicing
this dance for months.

23:37.416 --> 23:41.654
And you know that
we need six dancers.

23:41.654 --> 23:43.055
And no offense, AnnaBeth,
but you couldn't execute

23:43.055 --> 23:45.191
a Spanish waltz
if you had a year to practice.

23:45.191 --> 23:46.392
Now, Dr. Hart

23:46.392 --> 23:47.660
is not the doctor in this town,

23:47.660 --> 23:49.261
and she cannot
just come down here

23:49.261 --> 23:52.699
and take away every single thing
that is important to me. Daddy!

23:55.434 --> 23:58.170
(country song playing)

23:59.672 --> 24:00.907
I should have known

24:00.907 --> 24:03.209
you would try to pull
a stunt like this.

24:03.209 --> 24:05.712
You're the most irresponsible
person I've ever met.

24:05.712 --> 24:09.148
You seem a bit more upset than
the situation calls for, Doc.

24:09.148 --> 24:10.750
It is just a parade.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.952
I can't believe
I'm going to say this--

24:12.952 --> 24:14.687
but it's the
Founder's Day Parade.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.422
Lavon is counting on us.

24:16.422 --> 24:17.724
I'mcounting on us.

24:17.724 --> 24:19.391
For some reason, I need
the people to think

24:19.391 --> 24:20.960
that I fit into
this town,

24:20.960 --> 24:23.429
or I can't get patients and
I will lose the practice that

24:23.429 --> 24:26.298
I inherited only four
days ago, and ruin my
dead father's legacy,

24:26.298 --> 24:27.834
not to mention
the fellowship
I have worked for

24:27.834 --> 24:30.302
my entire life.
It may sound...

24:30.302 --> 24:31.571
* *

24:31.571 --> 24:33.105
What are you doing?

24:33.105 --> 24:36.375
You were freaking out--
I thought I'd snap you out of it

24:36.375 --> 24:37.944
with my generic beer breath.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.446
Excuse me.

24:40.446 --> 24:42.649
(clears throat)

24:43.650 --> 24:45.184
What are you gaping at?

24:45.184 --> 24:48.655
We've got a float to build
don't we? Come on, girl.

24:54.293 --> 24:56.162
ROSE:
 Frederick. Dean.

24:56.162 --> 24:57.830
He has two first names.

24:57.830 --> 25:01.000
I mean, something
about that is just
so old-school cool.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.736
And OMG, I saw he was
reading Chew the other day.

25:03.736 --> 25:05.137
That's, like,
my favorite comic book.

25:05.137 --> 25:06.939
But I didn't know
how to tell him.

25:06.939 --> 25:10.076
Kid... do I look like
iCarly to you?

25:11.210 --> 25:14.547
If I hear the name
Frederick Dean one more time,

25:14.547 --> 25:16.015
I'm gonna hot-glue
your lips together.

25:16.015 --> 25:18.718
Where is your sense
of romance?

25:20.019 --> 25:22.154
What happened?

25:22.154 --> 25:23.756
You fell asleep.

25:23.756 --> 25:26.292
Good shot for
the BlueBell Beat blog, though.

25:26.292 --> 25:27.860
WADE:
Very doctorly.

25:30.296 --> 25:32.565
You guys, it looks...

25:32.565 --> 25:34.066
Astonishing.

25:34.066 --> 25:35.568
Whoo! (laughs)

25:35.568 --> 25:37.403
Better than I
even imagined.

25:37.403 --> 25:38.771
Wade, my friend,

25:38.771 --> 25:41.040
I knew I could
count on you.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.508
(chuckles)

25:42.508 --> 25:44.844
And, Rose Hattenbarger,

25:44.844 --> 25:46.378
well, since you are joining us,

25:46.378 --> 25:49.481
will you do me the honor
of wearing the Alabama costume?

25:49.481 --> 25:50.983
That is a great idea.

25:50.983 --> 25:53.185
Y-E-S.
I'd be honored.

25:53.185 --> 25:55.688
Good. Why don't I take
you all for some pancakes

25:55.688 --> 25:57.223
to carb-load for the big day?

25:57.223 --> 25:58.257
I am starving!

25:58.257 --> 25:59.425
Uh, Zoe...

25:59.425 --> 26:02.795
(clears throat) Lavon Hayes
has a rep to protect.

26:03.863 --> 26:05.197
You best go
and get yourself a shower

26:05.197 --> 26:06.899
before you ride
the tide with me, girl.

26:09.501 --> 26:11.704
* *

26:15.808 --> 26:18.978
Hear you're riding
on the mayor's float.

26:18.978 --> 26:22.214
Well, I am one of his
favorite people, so...

26:23.950 --> 26:26.418
Excuse me.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.287
Can I talk to you?

26:32.524 --> 26:34.326
What are you doing?

26:34.326 --> 26:37.630
We talked about this--
you can't perform today.
LEMON: And why not?

26:37.630 --> 26:39.632
Because of her
hurt shoulder?

26:39.632 --> 26:42.501
Show her, Betty.

26:42.501 --> 26:43.736
Yeah.

26:43.736 --> 26:44.937
Betty's glenoid
labrum is fine.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.338
I examined it again
myself, Dr. Hart.

26:46.338 --> 26:48.941
Boy, you are on quite a roll.

26:48.941 --> 26:51.610
Betty can't be in the parade.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.612
Betty, tell them.

26:53.612 --> 26:56.148
You have no choice.

26:56.148 --> 26:57.283
(scoffs)

27:01.721 --> 27:04.290
(chuckles):
Dr. Hart, my shoulder is fine.

27:04.290 --> 27:05.892
What is yourproblem?

27:05.892 --> 27:08.427
Are you just
out to get us,

27:08.427 --> 27:11.964
or did you go to
medical school by
correspondence course?

27:18.671 --> 27:21.473
Enjoy the parade.

27:21.473 --> 27:22.842
You okay?

27:22.842 --> 27:25.477
Okay, back to work.

27:25.477 --> 27:27.579
BRICK:
Not much time left.

27:27.579 --> 27:29.148
WOMAN:
She has made

27:29.148 --> 27:31.751
a lot of mistakes.
Well, she's new here.

27:31.751 --> 27:33.185
And Lavon likes her.

27:33.185 --> 27:36.422
She's riding his float--
that's a big honor.

27:36.422 --> 27:37.790
Big honor.

27:37.790 --> 27:40.659
And I just lovethose
little shorts she wears.

27:40.659 --> 27:41.994
(chuckling)

27:47.767 --> 27:49.168
Dr. Hart.

27:50.469 --> 27:53.639
I'm so sorry about how
I spoke to you earlier.

27:53.639 --> 27:55.474
I know you're
just trying to help.

27:55.474 --> 27:59.211
Betty, how you speak to me
is the least of my concerns.

27:59.211 --> 28:01.213
I care about your health,
and that's why

28:01.213 --> 28:02.749
you can't be in
that parade today--

28:02.749 --> 28:04.116
you'll be jeopardizing it.

28:04.116 --> 28:06.753
I don't know how many ways
I can tell you this.

28:06.753 --> 28:08.120
You don't understand.

28:08.120 --> 28:12.058
Back home in Huntsville,
I'm just a plain girl.

28:12.058 --> 28:15.161
I'm a loner, I'm shy...

28:15.161 --> 28:18.197
But every summer, I come
here to... to BlueBell,

28:18.197 --> 28:20.599
where I'm a Breeland,
I'm a Belle,

28:20.599 --> 28:22.501
which, here, is like
being a princess.

28:22.501 --> 28:27.006
And I live those ten months
for the other two months,

28:27.006 --> 28:29.809
and I just wanted
that feeling to go on

28:29.809 --> 28:31.677
as long as it
possibly could.

28:31.677 --> 28:33.946
Betty...

28:33.946 --> 28:36.949
I understand being an outcast
more than anyone.

28:36.949 --> 28:38.785
But I don't think
you should risk

28:38.785 --> 28:40.152
triggering
another episode.

28:40.152 --> 28:42.855
No, but it's worth the risk.

28:42.855 --> 28:45.958
Because with my condition...

28:45.958 --> 28:48.895
both you and I know...

28:48.895 --> 28:51.063
it's probably my...

28:51.063 --> 28:54.400
last chance to really live.

29:00.239 --> 29:03.442
Then at the very
least, take this.

29:11.150 --> 29:12.284
Baclofen.

29:12.284 --> 29:14.987
It should help stave off
some of the spasticity.

29:14.987 --> 29:16.522
You take one
three times a day

29:16.522 --> 29:18.991
until you can get home
and see your own doctor.

29:18.991 --> 29:21.460
But just one--
it's strong stuff.

29:24.563 --> 29:26.565
Thank you.

29:26.565 --> 29:27.800
I...

29:27.800 --> 29:29.401
It's okay.

29:31.103 --> 29:32.771
Okay.

29:36.108 --> 29:39.078
(marching band playing,
crowd cheering)

30:02.835 --> 30:05.004
* *

30:16.883 --> 30:18.450
* *

30:22.955 --> 30:24.823
(marching band ends song)

30:24.823 --> 30:27.193
(gentle waltz playing)

30:27.193 --> 30:28.995
* *

30:28.995 --> 30:31.397
(crowd cheering)

30:45.577 --> 30:48.014
* *

31:05.197 --> 31:07.666
I apologize for what
I'm about to do.

31:07.666 --> 31:09.468
Wade! Stop the tractor!

31:09.468 --> 31:12.538
Wade, give me the wheel!
I need to create a diversion!

31:12.538 --> 31:13.572
What? No!

31:13.572 --> 31:14.706
WADE:
Get off of me!

31:14.706 --> 31:17.476
What are you doing!
Saving someone's life!

31:18.945 --> 31:21.147
Give me the wheel!

31:34.093 --> 31:36.562
What the hell
did you do?

31:36.562 --> 31:39.098
I'm sorry. Look,
please cover for me.

31:39.098 --> 31:40.399
I have to take care
of something.

31:40.399 --> 31:41.400
Excuse me!

31:46.505 --> 31:48.975
Grab Betty, get her to my
office now-- no matter what.

31:48.975 --> 31:51.743
(clears throat)

31:51.743 --> 31:54.113
Well, today, uh...

31:54.113 --> 31:56.382
we mark the occasion
when our-our noble founder,

31:56.382 --> 31:58.117
Cyrus Lavinius
Jeremiah Jones...

31:58.117 --> 31:59.986
Did our float just crash?

31:59.986 --> 32:01.587
how does that happen?

32:01.587 --> 32:02.888
Hey, there. Hi.

32:02.888 --> 32:04.523
How's everybody feeling?

32:04.523 --> 32:05.791
Y'all okay?

32:05.791 --> 32:07.960
Oh, my goodness, Betty, you
got a big bump on your head.

32:07.960 --> 32:09.628
Come on, sweetie,
let's get you some ice.

32:11.230 --> 32:15.334
(clears throat)
So, um, in the spirit
of C.L.J. Jones,

32:15.334 --> 32:17.436
we'll improvise.
(chuckles)

32:17.436 --> 32:21.007
Give it up for, uh, our
high school marching band, huh?

32:21.007 --> 32:23.075
(door opens)

32:24.076 --> 32:25.577
What's going on?

32:25.577 --> 32:27.613
Uh... everything's...

32:27.613 --> 32:28.947
...spinning.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.416
Is it the M.S.?

32:30.416 --> 32:33.085
Really? You had
to crash the float?
I had no choice.

32:33.085 --> 32:34.620
How many Baclofen
did you take?

32:34.620 --> 32:37.756
I had another episode and my
legs were rigid-- I freaked out.

32:37.756 --> 32:39.158
I took a bunch.

32:39.725 --> 32:40.859
Oh!
Hold on.

32:40.859 --> 32:42.161
Oh!
She's overdosing.

32:42.161 --> 32:44.296
We need to get
activated charcoal

32:44.296 --> 32:45.864
before she starts
to seize.

32:45.864 --> 32:47.199
Let's get her on the table.

32:47.199 --> 32:48.500
Okay.
Lift her.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.736
Okay. Legs.

32:50.736 --> 32:52.838
I... am gonna kill that lunatic.

32:52.838 --> 32:54.673
Or better yet, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna sue her.

32:54.673 --> 32:56.975
She can't just go around
just crashing floats!

32:56.975 --> 32:58.444
She can't...
I'm just gonna...

32:58.444 --> 33:00.012
sue her for
mental distress

33:00.012 --> 33:01.447
or-or attempted...

33:01.447 --> 33:04.183
negligence or attempted murder
or something like that,

33:04.183 --> 33:06.518
and as my lawyer, I insist
that you draw up the papers.

33:06.518 --> 33:09.021
And as your fiancé,
I insist you look at me,

33:09.021 --> 33:12.424
take deep breaths...
Whew!

33:12.424 --> 33:13.892
Okay.

33:13.892 --> 33:16.862
Now you're angry and
you've had a bit of a scare.

33:16.862 --> 33:19.631
Trust me when I say,
I know how much this
parade means to you,

33:19.631 --> 33:22.034
but right now... I got
to make sure everyone's safe,

33:22.034 --> 33:24.636
and we got a hell of
a mess to clean up, okay?

33:24.636 --> 33:26.372
(inhales, exhales)

33:26.372 --> 33:27.773
Okay.

33:27.773 --> 33:29.508
Love you.
Okay.

33:31.477 --> 33:33.045
(exhales)

33:34.246 --> 33:37.983
Hey, Rose, I saw the float
crash-- are you okay?

33:37.983 --> 33:39.885
Frederick Dean.

33:39.885 --> 33:41.653
What?

33:41.653 --> 33:44.056
You think I'm some
Belle all a-tizzy

33:44.056 --> 33:46.058
because my hoop skirt
got stuck in my hair?

33:46.058 --> 33:49.027
I'm not. Go help Magnolia.

33:49.027 --> 33:51.163
Oh. Okay.

33:51.163 --> 33:53.165
Hey, Rose, you, uh,

33:53.165 --> 33:54.800
get that new issue of Chew?

33:54.800 --> 33:56.468
I was hoping to borrow it.

33:59.638 --> 34:01.707
You read... Chew?

34:01.707 --> 34:03.809
WADE: Yeah, you kidding?
She's, like, the...

34:03.809 --> 34:05.344
the fan club president.

34:05.344 --> 34:08.679
Except I think releasing
number 27 out of sequence

34:08.679 --> 34:09.748
was way weird.

34:09.748 --> 34:12.083
Me, too. I don't get
why you do that,

34:12.083 --> 34:15.487
especially when the
USDA suicide mission
was so cool in 18.

34:15.487 --> 34:17.489
I'll get it
from you later.

34:20.326 --> 34:22.393
We are very lucky
we caught it in time.

34:22.393 --> 34:23.929
You could have
had a seizure,

34:23.929 --> 34:25.931
gone into a coma.

34:25.931 --> 34:28.234
I know it was stupid.

34:28.234 --> 34:30.636
Well, we all do
stupid things to fit in.

34:30.636 --> 34:32.971
Like me wearing
this football costume.

34:32.971 --> 34:34.706
Uniform.Good Lord!

34:35.974 --> 34:37.109
Whatever.

34:37.109 --> 34:39.478
Mrs. H is gonna
give you a ride home

34:39.478 --> 34:41.112
so you can get some rest. Okay.

34:41.112 --> 34:44.850
Don't worry, you'll be okay
for the rest of your trip.

34:44.850 --> 34:46.851
And no one will ever know.

34:46.851 --> 34:49.888
Thank you for covering for me.

34:49.888 --> 34:53.225
I know this is not going to help
with your popularity problem.

34:53.225 --> 34:55.360
Don't you worry about me.

34:55.360 --> 34:58.330
You take care of yourself,
Betty the Belle.

35:04.102 --> 35:06.104
I'm off to face
the music,

35:06.104 --> 35:09.308
the weird, old-timey,
banjo-y music.

35:11.977 --> 35:13.845
(pops lips)

35:19.117 --> 35:20.852
ZOE:
Lemon?

35:22.954 --> 35:25.491
Lemon, I'm sorry.

35:25.491 --> 35:26.758
Really?

35:26.758 --> 35:29.261
You really think
"sorry's" gonna cut it?

35:29.261 --> 35:31.730
Um... yes.

35:34.866 --> 35:36.868
Just tell me why.

35:36.868 --> 35:38.670
Why'd you do it?

35:38.670 --> 35:40.239
(sighs)

35:40.239 --> 35:42.774
Are you just...
mocking us?

35:42.774 --> 35:46.278
Are our traditions
just a big joke to you?

35:46.278 --> 35:48.847
Do you think you're
just too good for us here?

35:48.847 --> 35:49.781
No!

35:49.781 --> 35:51.717
Then admit it,
you are just hell-bent

35:51.717 --> 35:54.286
on destroying anything
that's important to me--

35:54.286 --> 35:56.722
the-the parade, my
engagement party...

35:56.722 --> 35:58.290
No!
Then why?

35:58.290 --> 36:00.926
Why did you crash your float?

36:06.698 --> 36:08.334
Exactly.

36:09.901 --> 36:11.570
Everyone...

36:11.570 --> 36:14.840
Zoe Hart may be Harley
Wilkes' daughter,

36:14.840 --> 36:16.508
but she is not him,

36:16.508 --> 36:19.245
and I think I speak for
everyone when I say:

36:19.245 --> 36:22.013
we don't want you here.

36:22.013 --> 36:25.217
* *

36:34.125 --> 36:36.795
* *

36:36.795 --> 36:38.997
EMMELINE:
Hey.

36:38.997 --> 36:41.367
Heard you were hiding.

36:41.367 --> 36:43.635
I blew it.
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

36:43.635 --> 36:46.071
I know you just
wanted me to fit in,

36:46.071 --> 36:47.506
but I'm not Harley.

36:47.506 --> 36:51.377
Now, I am sorry if you feel
like I was pressuring you.

36:51.377 --> 36:54.246
Look, Brick is
a good doctor,

36:54.246 --> 36:58.116
but sometimes he gets
stuck in his ways and...

36:58.116 --> 37:00.218
worse, he puts
his own needs first.

37:00.218 --> 37:01.887
Harley wasn't like that.
Yeah, yeah.

37:01.887 --> 37:04.390
Harley was a saint,
and I'm nothing like him.

37:04.390 --> 37:07.058
Oh, no, no, no, no,
you don't understand.

37:07.058 --> 37:10.529
Listen, what you did today,
sacrificing yourself

37:10.529 --> 37:13.799
to be a part of this town,
to treat a patient,

37:13.799 --> 37:15.166
that was amazing.

37:15.166 --> 37:17.536
And thatwas Harley
to the core.

37:18.804 --> 37:20.806
Thanks, Mrs. H.

37:23.909 --> 37:26.244
Listen, like you...

37:26.244 --> 37:28.680
I've been a little lost...

37:28.680 --> 37:31.883
and this job, I mean,
sometimes I love it,

37:31.883 --> 37:34.886
but... it's just,
it's not my dream.

37:34.886 --> 37:38.424
Six months ago, my daughter
and I, we bought a bakery

37:38.424 --> 37:41.460
down in Shreveport, and I
was gonna move down there

37:41.460 --> 37:43.529
to help her start it up.

37:43.529 --> 37:44.896
But then Harley died,

37:44.896 --> 37:48.700
and I didn't want to
leave BlueBell until...

37:49.968 --> 37:53.572
...until the right person
came along to take after him.

37:53.572 --> 37:55.774
What are you saying?

37:55.774 --> 37:57.576
* *

37:57.576 --> 38:01.380
I think... I think it's okay
for me to leave now.

38:02.648 --> 38:04.583
Mrs. H, I'm not
the right person.

38:04.583 --> 38:07.719
There is no way I can get
30% of those patients now.

38:07.719 --> 38:09.855
I'll lose the practice,
and the fellowship.

38:09.855 --> 38:12.558
One day soon, people are
gonna see that your heart

38:12.558 --> 38:14.326
is as deep as Harley's was,

38:14.326 --> 38:16.395
and that, like him,

38:16.395 --> 38:18.129
you listen.

38:18.129 --> 38:20.198
I'm confident.

38:20.198 --> 38:22.468
* *

38:22.468 --> 38:24.903
Good-bye, Dr. Hart.

38:30.175 --> 38:32.544
(chuckles)

38:32.544 --> 38:35.180
Believe me, you're
gonna do just fine.

38:35.180 --> 38:37.383
* *

38:41.086 --> 38:43.088
And if you're ever in doubt,

38:43.088 --> 38:44.623
you have these.

38:44.623 --> 38:46.124
He's in there.

38:46.124 --> 38:49.595
I'm just sorry you
didn't get to know him

38:49.595 --> 38:52.498
like you deserved to.

38:56.067 --> 38:59.070
* *

39:10.081 --> 39:12.150
She was so
happy that day.

39:12.150 --> 39:16.021
The Founder's Parade
was her favorite event

39:16.021 --> 39:18.356
of the whole season.

39:19.290 --> 39:22.761
Every year at this
time, I think...

39:22.761 --> 39:26.432
maybe Mama'll come back.

39:26.432 --> 39:28.767
If not to see us, then...

39:28.767 --> 39:31.970
at least to see
the Belle float.

39:32.938 --> 39:34.339
Sugar...

39:34.339 --> 39:37.843
it was 12 years
ago she left.

39:37.843 --> 39:40.779
You're gonna have
to start letting go.

39:43.449 --> 39:45.283
Have you?

39:45.283 --> 39:48.487
* *

40:18.850 --> 40:21.319
SHULA:
Why are you hiding?

40:21.319 --> 40:23.622
hiding on the back porch?

40:23.622 --> 40:26.792
What's the matter
with you today?

40:26.792 --> 40:30.629
You disobeyed me...
(continues indistinctly)

40:30.629 --> 40:33.499
What do you want?

40:34.933 --> 40:37.002
I've been thinking
about your symptoms.

40:37.002 --> 40:40.205
Maybe I misdiagnosed you
the first time you came in.

40:40.205 --> 40:42.207
Really?

40:45.977 --> 40:47.378
Who's this?

40:47.378 --> 40:48.614
Oh.

40:48.614 --> 40:51.116
This is Prince...

40:51.116 --> 40:54.352
Purr... fection the Third.

40:54.352 --> 40:56.555
Oh, yeah?

41:01.893 --> 41:02.928
So...

41:02.928 --> 41:04.830
I was looking
at your file,

41:04.830 --> 41:07.432
and I noticed that
your illnesses began

41:07.432 --> 41:09.768
after your mother died.

41:09.768 --> 41:11.570
So?

41:11.570 --> 41:14.573
It must be hard to
be here without her.

41:14.573 --> 41:17.142
I don't have any
family here, either.

41:17.142 --> 41:19.578
And I miss it--

41:19.578 --> 41:23.749
them-- more than
I would have guessed.

41:23.749 --> 41:27.586
She made the
best peach pie.

41:27.586 --> 41:30.188
I love peach pie.

41:30.188 --> 41:31.256
You do?

41:31.256 --> 41:32.558
I do.
(laughs)

41:32.558 --> 41:34.292
You don't look like
you eat no peach pie.

41:34.292 --> 41:35.727
Oh, I'll eat
a peach pie.

41:35.727 --> 41:38.329
You put a peach pie
in front of me,
I will eat it.

41:38.329 --> 41:39.598
Well, we got plenty
of it here.

41:39.598 --> 41:41.232
(both laughing)
