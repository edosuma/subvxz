00:02.880 --> 00:04.760
Having a large house
is all well and good

00:04.800 --> 00:06.800
but one does tend to rattle around
in it.

00:06.840 --> 00:10.280
I was going to invite you to come and
stay there. I could help the war effort.

00:10.320 --> 00:13.000
Maybe you're talking to the wrong
people. Leave it with me.

00:13.040 --> 00:14.920
Perhaps I can make you a few new
friends.

00:14.960 --> 00:16.440
We must all help as much as we can.

00:16.480 --> 00:20.440
I have room to spare and these
poor Belgian refugees don't have
a roof over their heads.

00:20.480 --> 00:22.280
I have your money.

00:22.320 --> 00:24.320
You'll be hearing from me.

00:25.760 --> 00:28.760
He and Gabriella, they run the
restaurant for me.

00:28.800 --> 00:30.800
She's come to live with us.

00:31.680 --> 00:35.120
These are our boys. Off to fight for
king and country.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.840
Promise me one thing.
Come home to me.

Oh, look. This might be from George.

01:24.480 --> 01:27.000
"Dear Aggie, missing you and hope
you're well.

01:27.040 --> 01:29.920
Food here is good, not a patch on
your homecooking though.

01:29.960 --> 01:31.960
Made lots of new friends..."

01:33.560 --> 01:35.560
That's funny, why's that blacked
out?

01:37.680 --> 01:40.200
Well, in any case he sounds happy
and healthy.

01:42.120 --> 01:46.720
Mm. People... people are still saying

01:46.760 --> 01:48.760
that our boys will be home by
Christmas.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.800
Oh, I shouldn't wonder.

01:50.840 --> 01:53.000
That'll be Florian.

01:53.040 --> 01:54.640
I do hope she speaks English.

01:54.680 --> 01:56.960
It's going to be terribly awkward if
she doesn't.

02:03.800 --> 02:05.800
Miss Mardle?

02:06.560 --> 02:08.560
I'm Florian Dupont.

02:10.360 --> 02:12.280
The Belgian relief charity sent me?

02:13.800 --> 02:16.000
You are most kind to extend this
hospitality.

02:17.560 --> 02:19.560
Oh, yes, of course.
Please, do come in.

02:29.400 --> 02:32.400
It'll feel strange this evening not
having light in the windows

02:32.440 --> 02:34.400
for the first time since we opened.
I know.

02:34.440 --> 02:36.520
London's really starting to feel
different.

02:37.600 --> 02:39.960
What exactly is the point of lights
out after night?

02:40.000 --> 02:41.920
It's this Defence Of The Realm Act.

02:41.960 --> 02:45.000
Harder for German Zeppelins to
pinpoint English targets.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.480
Telephone call for you, Mr Leclair.

02:48.440 --> 02:50.440
Excuse me.

02:54.960 --> 02:57.320
Is Henri going to fight for France?

02:57.360 --> 03:00.360
He promised me he'd stay with the
store for six months.

03:00.400 --> 03:02.400
After that, we'll see what happens.

03:02.440 --> 03:03.800
I know I'd fight if I could.

03:03.840 --> 03:05.840
You can't, Gordon.

03:06.840 --> 03:10.160
You should just be glad that you have
a job that you can focus on every day.

03:10.200 --> 03:12.200
I'm not complaining, it's just...

03:15.240 --> 03:17.480
..it's just I can't get our chaps
off my mind.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.680
I'll wait for you in the car.

03:29.320 --> 03:32.520
I'm going to be moving him to
another department today.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.960
Help take his mind off his friends.

03:36.200 --> 03:38.600
It's hard on him being left behind.

03:38.640 --> 03:42.120
I know, I... think we all wish we
could do more.

03:43.920 --> 03:46.280
How about if I take you out to dinner
tomorrow night?

03:46.320 --> 03:49.440
Just the two of us.
Yeah? What's the occasion?

03:49.480 --> 03:51.520
Can't a husband spoil his wife?

03:51.560 --> 03:53.560
All right.
That would be lovely.

03:57.360 --> 03:59.360
I don't care, it's not my...

04:05.000 --> 04:07.520
You've taken my money
and given me nothing.

04:07.560 --> 04:10.040
Do your job and get me a result.

04:19.279 --> 04:21.480
You were in Paris, Mr Dupont?

04:21.519 --> 04:23.280
I worked there for
a couple of years.

04:23.320 --> 04:27.080
Yes, I was touring there with my
orchestra when war broke out.

04:27.120 --> 04:29.840
Oh, you're a musician?
Violinist.

04:29.880 --> 04:33.480
But as you see... no violin.

04:33.520 --> 04:38.120
We had to disband quickly. I couldn't
return to Belgium...

04:39.120 --> 04:41.120
..and my little village.

04:42.920 --> 04:45.000
I heard the attack was bad.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.800
Very bad.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
And your family?

04:52.960 --> 04:54.960
No word.

04:57.720 --> 05:00.800
But my manners. You must excuse me.

05:00.840 --> 05:04.160
All I have left is in this bag.
No gift for your kindness.

05:04.200 --> 05:07.840
Oh, nonsense. Now drink your coffee
before it gets cold.

05:16.200 --> 05:18.560
Where are you off to, then?
I'll tell you later.

05:19.600 --> 05:21.600
Any word from George?

05:21.640 --> 05:23.640
This arrived this morning.

05:23.680 --> 05:25.680
He sounds all bright and breezy.

05:25.720 --> 05:27.720
And?

05:29.360 --> 05:32.720
Nothing. Just they've blacked out a
bit of what he's written.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.760
I hope he's all right.

05:34.800 --> 05:37.920
Well, if he sounds chipper, just you
keep that in your head.

05:46.600 --> 05:50.080
We had a letter from Gabriella, too.
She sounded happy enough.

05:50.120 --> 05:52.560
Where is she?
Italy.

05:52.600 --> 05:54.600
She's gone home for good.

06:01.440 --> 06:03.480
Mr Edwards has nearly a whole page
now.

06:05.120 --> 06:07.440
See what happens when you work hard,
Miss Pertree?

06:07.480 --> 06:09.640
That must be why you haven't seen him
in a while.

06:09.680 --> 06:11.520
He's got his eye on another girl.

06:14.520 --> 06:18.200
Men are very simple creatures,
Miss Pertree.

06:19.240 --> 06:21.360
They just need reminding
from time to time...

06:22.760 --> 06:24.760
..what they're missing.

06:24.800 --> 06:27.640
I think it might be time to pay Mr
Edwards a little visit.

06:29.400 --> 06:32.040
I showed him to his bedroom, what
more can I do, Agnes?

06:32.080 --> 06:34.520
We're two single women in a house
with a single man.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.400
It's unseemly to say the least.
We'll explain to him tonight,

06:37.440 --> 06:40.840
both of us together. He needs to
find more suitable accommodation.

06:40.880 --> 06:43.240
Thank you. I feel awful about doing
this on my own.

06:43.280 --> 06:45.640
I just need to think of something to
soften the blow.

06:45.680 --> 06:47.680
Excuse me.

06:47.720 --> 06:50.360
Good morning, Mr Selfridge.
Good morning, Miss Mardle.

06:50.400 --> 06:52.720
I've asked my son to join me here

06:52.760 --> 06:55.080
because I'm transferring him to the
Tea Emporium -

06:55.120 --> 06:57.080
Tea? Tea?

06:58.400 --> 07:00.400
When my friends have guns in their
hands?

07:03.880 --> 07:07.080
The department manager has enlisted
and we have staff moves to make.

07:07.120 --> 07:09.120
My son will be a junior assistant.

07:10.200 --> 07:12.760
You've earned your chance on the
shop floor now, Gordon.

07:12.800 --> 07:16.160
Can you release Miss Calthorpe for a
while, please?

07:16.200 --> 07:18.720
Am I right in thinking she started in
that department?

07:18.760 --> 07:20.760
Of course, Mr Selfridge.

07:23.480 --> 07:25.720
Miss Mardle, I worked my way up to
accessories.

07:25.760 --> 07:27.760
Well, it won't be for long.

07:27.800 --> 07:30.320
And I'm sure Master Selfridge will
learn very quickly.

07:38.760 --> 07:41.480
On the whole, the women are willing.
Enthusiastic.

07:41.520 --> 07:44.320
There are, of course,
some teething problems.

07:44.360 --> 07:46.400
Oh, good grief!

07:46.440 --> 07:49.120
Are we surprised?
These are women.

07:49.160 --> 07:51.360
We can't just expect them
to slot in.

07:53.280 --> 07:56.240
Mr Crabb, we're all aware this is a
period of transition.

07:56.280 --> 07:59.440
That's why I'm down here. I'll be
checking in on all the departments

07:59.480 --> 08:01.280
during the week.

08:01.320 --> 08:03.440
We'll have to teach a lot more of
them to drive.

08:03.480 --> 08:05.760
Of course, they can't lift some of
the boxes.

08:07.600 --> 08:10.120
Why exactly are they wearing the
men's outfits again?

08:10.160 --> 08:11.680
Standard issue.

08:11.720 --> 08:14.080
The men's overalls over their
everyday clothes.

08:14.120 --> 08:16.480
As I've been telling everyone,
quite impractical.

08:16.520 --> 08:20.080
Now if you'll excuse me, I have a
meeting with the Counting House staff.

08:24.400 --> 08:27.240
Speak to the girls during your staff
assessment, Mr Grove.

08:27.280 --> 08:29.720
Find out if there's anything we can
do to help.

08:29.760 --> 08:32.760
Of course. And what's the matter
with Mr Crabb?

08:34.559 --> 08:38.600
Well, he has a rather... special
birthday tomorrow.

08:38.640 --> 08:40.640
I think he's afraid you're going
to...

08:41.760 --> 08:45.040
He's a little upset not being able
to fight for king and country.

08:45.080 --> 08:47.720
He did, after all, so enjoy
organising the men's march

08:47.760 --> 08:49.760
through the store.

08:52.920 --> 08:55.880
I know you're very busy, but I need
to lean on your expertise

08:55.920 --> 08:58.360
and your wisdom on a very important
matter.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.360
What is it, Mr Selfridge?

09:00.400 --> 09:02.640
As I look around the various
departments,

09:02.680 --> 09:06.560
my own family even, and I see how
difficult it is

09:06.600 --> 09:08.760
for the people left behind
during war.

09:09.640 --> 09:13.920
I think we need a Selfridge's
training scheme of some description.

09:13.960 --> 09:17.720
Something... practical and worthwhile.

09:19.360 --> 09:22.400
What about teaching staff volunteers
to shoot, Mr Selfridge?

09:22.440 --> 09:26.000
I've heard of an excellent rifle
training ground nearby.

09:26.040 --> 09:28.400
The men left behind would welcome an
opportunity

09:28.440 --> 09:30.800
to defend themselves if called upon.
You think so?

09:30.840 --> 09:35.040
I know so. I will investigate
immediately, Mr Selfridge.

09:35.080 --> 09:37.880
Immediately. Well, if it's not too
much trouble, Mr Crabb.

09:44.240 --> 09:46.960
In difficult times, ladies need
glamour more than ever.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
My displays reflect that.

09:49.040 --> 09:52.240
Of course. Selfridge's will always
offer glamour.

09:53.360 --> 09:56.200
This is about fashion and fashion
constantly evolves.

09:56.240 --> 09:59.080
A Poiret evening gown is a timeless
work of art!

09:59.120 --> 10:01.160
It's about the woman, not the dress.

10:01.200 --> 10:04.280
The country's at war. They're
joining the Red Cross,

10:04.320 --> 10:07.480
they're learning to drive. Our
displays need to reflect that.

10:07.520 --> 10:09.520
Lecture me about war?

10:09.560 --> 10:12.440
Why aren't you in France,
fighting for your country?

10:15.320 --> 10:19.600
If you ever question my patriotism
or personal integrity again,

10:19.640 --> 10:21.640
we'll exchange more than words.

10:21.680 --> 10:23.680
Is that clear?

10:41.802 --> 10:44.922
- Apparently accessories is down 16%.
- You'll have to -

10:44.962 --> 10:48.202
Yes?
Miss Day to see you, Mr Selfridge.

10:48.242 --> 10:51.402
Harry. If you'll excuse me, please.
Thank you.

10:57.282 --> 10:59.682
I remembered our little chat
about you

10:59.722 --> 11:01.962
wanting to be more involved
in the war effort

11:02.002 --> 11:04.762
and I've heard that
someone's retiring

11:04.802 --> 11:06.882
from the Military Procurement
Committee,

11:06.922 --> 11:09.002
which means there could be a vacancy
for you.

11:10.642 --> 11:12.642
Do you think they would consider me?

11:12.682 --> 11:15.042
I think you just need the chance to
persuade them.

11:15.082 --> 11:18.082
So I thought I could host
a card game

11:18.122 --> 11:21.082
and then you can have a word
in Lord Edgerton's ear.

11:21.122 --> 11:23.762
Tell him that you want
an official role.

11:23.802 --> 11:25.802
This country needs your help, Harry.

11:25.842 --> 11:29.122
Sounds like you have it
all figured out.

11:29.162 --> 11:32.042
Well, I thought tomorrow evening
would be fine.

11:32.082 --> 11:34.082
Tomorrow?
That a problem?

11:34.122 --> 11:37.722
Well, it's just... I offered to take
Rose out.

11:37.762 --> 11:39.762
I'm sure she'll understand.

11:39.802 --> 11:42.402
Besides, I've already invited the
others.

11:42.442 --> 11:45.602
I've picked some pretty high-powered
people.

11:45.642 --> 11:47.722
These chances don't come around
often.

11:49.762 --> 11:51.202
Looks like I can't say no.

11:51.242 --> 11:53.522
I hoped you wouldn't. I'll see you
tomorrow, then.

11:58.562 --> 12:02.202
Miss Ellis, Mr Selfridge has asked
me to address the problem

12:02.242 --> 12:04.602
with the ladies clothing.
Perhaps you'll be so good

12:04.642 --> 12:07.242
as to enlighten me? We are having
problems, Mr Grove.

12:07.282 --> 12:09.282
Our skirts, they're too long.

12:09.322 --> 12:11.522
And I'd like to see a man
bend down to pick up a box

12:11.562 --> 12:14.642
when you're all squeezed in here and
all pushed up here.

12:14.682 --> 12:16.682
Yes, very good, very good.

12:16.722 --> 12:20.682
I shall speak to Mr Selfridge myself
on this somewhat delicate matter.

12:20.722 --> 12:22.722
Thank you, Miss Ellis.

12:28.722 --> 12:30.722
Dear me.

12:30.762 --> 12:33.162
Taxi!
Delphine!

12:33.202 --> 12:35.202
Hello.

12:35.242 --> 12:37.602
I'm having lunch with Harry.
Do you want to join us?

12:37.642 --> 12:39.722
I feel like I haven't seen you in
ages.

12:39.762 --> 12:42.762
Oh, lunch? I am so busy at the
moment.

12:42.802 --> 12:45.602
Erm, we'll get together soon.
Bye, darling.

12:51.642 --> 12:53.642
Rothman Street, please.

12:55.202 --> 12:57.202
Thank you, Mr Selfridge.
Thank you.

13:04.762 --> 13:07.242
I ran into Delphine coming out of
the store.

13:07.282 --> 13:10.202
I asked her to join us for lunch,
but she said she was busy.

13:10.242 --> 13:13.202
She's arranging a card game
and she's asked me along.

13:14.362 --> 13:16.362
Delphine came to see you?

13:16.402 --> 13:20.082
It'll be a real opportunity for me to
become more a part of the war effort.

13:20.122 --> 13:22.442
The only thing is it's
tomorrow night.

13:22.482 --> 13:24.482
Do you mind?

13:25.562 --> 13:27.562
No, no. You must go.

13:27.602 --> 13:29.602
Of course.

13:31.762 --> 13:34.602
It's just strange you didn't mention
it to me.

13:41.282 --> 13:43.482
Ah, Chief. Could I have a -

13:44.482 --> 13:46.322
Mrs Selfridge.

13:46.362 --> 13:50.082
Could I have a word with
you later, Mr Selfridge?

13:50.122 --> 13:52.162
You could have a word with me now.

13:53.482 --> 13:56.002
Well, it's a somewhat
delicate matter.

13:56.042 --> 13:59.922
The girls in the loading bay,
their clothes,

13:59.962 --> 14:04.322
are causing er... physical issues.

14:06.362 --> 14:08.842
Can I be of any help at all,
Mr Grove?

14:09.762 --> 14:12.162
Of course, the minute I heard about
clothing problems

14:12.202 --> 14:14.082
I figured that corsets had to be an
issue.

14:14.122 --> 14:16.122
It's difficult for us to bend down.

14:16.162 --> 14:19.042
And you know what? These skirts,
they're much too long.

14:19.082 --> 14:21.082
Here, take this right off.

14:21.122 --> 14:22.762
Yeah, this is too heavy.

14:22.802 --> 14:26.162
How about lighter overalls,
with a belt?

14:26.202 --> 14:30.722
Forget about corsets altogether.
Shorter skirts, yes?

14:30.762 --> 14:32.362
I'll speak with the seamstresses.

14:32.402 --> 14:34.682
We should get these made up right
away, Mr Grove.

14:34.722 --> 14:37.042
Now, is there anything else I can
help you with?

14:37.082 --> 14:39.082
Well...

14:41.842 --> 14:44.682
..we wouldn't mind a mirror or two
in the personal facilities.

14:44.722 --> 14:46.722
Yes, of course.

14:48.282 --> 14:51.162
There, that wasn't so hard now
was it, Mr Grove?

14:59.082 --> 15:01.002
Beg your pardon, m'lady,
but Cook says

15:01.042 --> 15:03.642
the butcher's at the scullery door
demanding to be paid.

15:03.682 --> 15:05.682
Then pay him.

15:28.482 --> 15:30.482
Where did that money come from?

15:30.522 --> 15:32.522
That's none of your concern.

15:32.562 --> 15:35.522
I'm going to be a lot more involved
in commerce from now on.

15:35.562 --> 15:37.722
I want you to take on
more charity work.

15:37.762 --> 15:39.922
Raise our profile around town.
Why?

15:39.962 --> 15:43.642
It's important that you look like
the perfect wife.

15:43.682 --> 15:46.602
Buy yourself a new wardrobe.
Jewellery.

15:46.642 --> 15:49.842
Being Lord and Lady Loxley
is very good for business.

15:55.802 --> 15:58.962
Lady Loxley.
What a lovely surprise.

15:59.002 --> 16:00.722
Let's get on with it, shall we?

16:00.762 --> 16:02.802
I have a whole new autumn wardrobe
in mind.

16:03.882 --> 16:05.882
Dazzle me.

16:19.682 --> 16:21.682
Come in.

16:24.162 --> 16:27.042
Miss Hawkins. To what do I owe this
pleasure?

16:28.162 --> 16:30.762
I haven't seen you in a while,
Mr Edwards.

16:30.802 --> 16:32.802
Well, I've been very busy.

16:33.842 --> 16:35.842
Please.

16:43.202 --> 16:45.202
Any scoops lately?

16:45.242 --> 16:47.242
I only wish.

16:47.282 --> 16:50.122
Our hands are tied when it's
information from the front line.

16:50.162 --> 16:52.162
Hm.

16:52.202 --> 16:56.002
I've heard letters from the front
line have sentences blacked out.

16:56.042 --> 16:58.322
The mail is censored. The Defence Of
The Realm Act

16:58.362 --> 16:59.922
covers writing as well as speech.

16:59.962 --> 17:02.922
I recently heard of a wife who
reported her husband to the police

17:02.962 --> 17:06.002
for saying something unpatriotic over
the dinner table.

17:06.041 --> 17:07.962
Never! She accused him
of being a spy

17:08.002 --> 17:11.082
because his second name was Wilhelm,
same as the Kaiser.

17:14.362 --> 17:16.482
Why the sudden interest in my work?

17:18.521 --> 17:21.002
I've always been interested in what
you write.

17:22.682 --> 17:26.962
Well, now. Where could this interest
possibly take us?

17:30.602 --> 17:32.602
Why don't you tell me, Mr Edwards?

17:32.642 --> 17:37.002
Might I call on you this evening
and er, take you out?

17:38.442 --> 17:40.442
You might.

17:40.482 --> 17:42.482
You've made my day, Miss Hawkins.

17:42.522 --> 17:44.522
Good.

17:46.202 --> 17:48.282
Because I've rather missed you,
Mr Edwards.

18:15.882 --> 18:19.082
All these tea and morning dresses,
evening gowns...

18:19.122 --> 18:20.762
they just don't appeal to me today.

18:20.802 --> 18:23.002
But imagine yourself
on Lord Loxley's arm,

18:23.042 --> 18:26.402
in a gown like this, as you enter a
wonderful soiree.

18:26.442 --> 18:28.442
Look at the exquisite flow
of this fabric.

18:28.482 --> 18:30.482
How can you resist?

18:30.522 --> 18:32.522
You're not listening to me.

18:32.562 --> 18:34.842
I feel I've seen all this before.

18:35.802 --> 18:37.842
More exciting departments call.

18:37.882 --> 18:39.882
Good day.

19:01.362 --> 19:03.362
Henri, what's the matter?

19:05.602 --> 19:09.042
I just want people to do their jobs
properly. Is that too much to ask?

19:11.242 --> 19:14.042
I hope you're not including me in
that. Did I mention you?

19:15.602 --> 19:17.602
Agnes, just because
we were close once

19:17.642 --> 19:20.242
doesn't give you the right to
interfere in my affairs.

19:21.642 --> 19:27.442
I...I wasn't interfering. I was just
asking what the matter was.

19:34.522 --> 19:36.522
Miss Towler!

19:37.842 --> 19:39.242
Can I have a word?

19:39.282 --> 19:42.202
As long as you're not going to bite
my head off. What do you mean?

19:42.242 --> 19:44.642
Oh, Mr Leclair upset me.

19:44.682 --> 19:46.042
Why, what happened?

19:46.082 --> 19:48.042
I don't know what's the matter with
him.

19:48.082 --> 19:50.282
Oh. Sorry to hear that.

19:51.442 --> 19:53.402
Well, I've had a bit of good news.

19:54.562 --> 19:56.562
Uncle Joe left me the restaurant.

19:57.562 --> 19:59.562
That's wonderful.
I know.

19:59.602 --> 20:01.602
I want to talk to you about it.

20:02.682 --> 20:05.722
Well, why don't you call on me at
Miss Mardle's tomorrow evening?

20:05.762 --> 20:08.202
We can talk about it then.
Right you are, Miss Towler.

20:20.402 --> 20:23.002
Rifle training tomorrow evening,
Master Selfridge.

20:23.042 --> 20:25.402
Best get your name on the list as
soon as possible.

20:25.442 --> 20:27.442
Certainly.

20:30.402 --> 20:32.402
Thank you.

20:35.362 --> 20:37.922
At least I'll get to hold a gun.

20:41.482 --> 20:43.482
Ooh

20:47.522 --> 20:49.522
Ah.

20:51.442 --> 20:53.442
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

20:56.082 --> 20:58.642
It's quite light. Feel that.

20:59.642 --> 21:01.482
Rifle training, Mrs Selfridge.

21:01.522 --> 21:03.522
Master Selfridge has just signed up.

21:03.562 --> 21:07.282
Did he? You know, sign me up, too,
will you?

21:07.322 --> 21:10.402
Maybe some of the ladies would like
to learn to shoot as well.

21:10.442 --> 21:13.882
Ladies! Is anyone interested in
learning how to fire a gun?

21:15.562 --> 21:18.202
I've always wanted to fire a gun!
Have you?

21:18.242 --> 21:20.562
Oh, right... all of you?

21:24.242 --> 21:26.522
Are you taking music lessons,
Miss Mardle?

21:26.562 --> 21:28.642
Er, first floor, please.

21:28.682 --> 21:30.762
No, actually. It's a gift.

21:32.522 --> 21:34.522
Very generous gift, I must say.

21:34.562 --> 21:37.362
Wouldn't mind being on the receiving
end myself.

21:48.202 --> 21:51.402
Lady Mae. To what do we owe this
honour?

21:52.522 --> 21:55.362
Hello, Harry. I'm just on
a little shopping spree.

21:55.402 --> 21:57.242
Well, I'm very pleased
that I caught you

21:57.282 --> 21:59.122
because I have a favour to ask you.

21:59.162 --> 22:01.682
Nothing that will get me into too
much trouble, I hope.

22:01.722 --> 22:04.402
Not in the least. I'm attending a
card game tomorrow night

22:04.442 --> 22:07.682
and I'd be very grateful if you
invited Lord Loxley on my behalf.

22:07.722 --> 22:09.722
Really?

22:09.762 --> 22:13.282
I must warn you he rather prides
himself on his winning streak.

22:13.322 --> 22:15.322
I think I can hold my own.

22:15.362 --> 22:17.322
I'm sure you can.
Where is it?

22:17.362 --> 22:19.362
Delphine's.
Oh.

22:19.402 --> 22:21.922
Well, it's bound to be very
exciting, then.

22:21.962 --> 22:24.202
There'll be other government
gentlemen there.

22:24.242 --> 22:26.242
Probably people Lord Loxley knows.

22:26.282 --> 22:28.122
I'll see what I can do.

22:28.162 --> 22:30.162
Thank you so much.

22:30.202 --> 22:32.962
Oh, um, I trust everything's to your
satisfaction?

22:34.242 --> 22:37.402
Well, yes, everything but the
fashion department, I'm afraid.

22:37.442 --> 22:41.282
Your chap there seems to think a
woman is a mere bauble

22:41.322 --> 22:43.322
to dangle off the arm of a man.

22:52.402 --> 22:54.602
I think it's best
if I do this on my own.

22:54.642 --> 22:58.482
It's my house, he simply cannot
stay.

22:59.922 --> 23:01.922
Well, if... if you're sure?

23:01.962 --> 23:03.962
Good luck.

23:10.922 --> 23:12.922
Oui?

23:14.922 --> 23:18.402
Er, Mr Dupont, might I have a word?

23:18.442 --> 23:20.442
Is that yours?

23:20.482 --> 23:23.162
Er, no. Er... no.

23:23.202 --> 23:25.882
It's erm... it's for you.

23:25.922 --> 23:27.922
A small gift.

23:30.442 --> 23:32.442
I cannot accept it.

23:33.602 --> 23:35.602
I'm afraid I'm going to have to
insist.

23:59.162 --> 24:01.722
I hate to think you waste your money,
Miss Mardle, but...

24:04.002 --> 24:06.602
..I don't know if I can play this
beautiful instrument.

24:06.642 --> 24:08.962
It will make me think of home.

24:11.602 --> 24:14.122
It might do you good to think of
home, Mr Dupont.

24:16.762 --> 24:19.322
I think you're the kindest person I
meet in my whole life.

24:23.842 --> 24:25.882
But you wanted to ask me something.

24:27.882 --> 24:29.882
Do you know, I've quite forgotten.

24:47.922 --> 24:49.922
I couldn't do it, Agnes.

24:49.962 --> 24:51.962
His face.

24:52.002 --> 24:54.002
The pain.

24:55.722 --> 24:57.722
You know, Miss Mardle, I'm glad.

24:57.762 --> 25:01.322
If George were in a
similar situation,

25:01.362 --> 25:04.322
I would hope that someone truly good
like you would help him out.

25:05.842 --> 25:07.842
I know that that would help me.

25:09.922 --> 25:13.482
It is unconventional, my dear.

25:14.602 --> 25:16.802
Isn't everything unconventional in
wartime?

25:29.322 --> 25:33.082
Lights out after shining on
Oxford Street for five years.

25:33.122 --> 25:36.682
When they come back on, you can do
the biggest, boldest display

25:36.722 --> 25:39.922
that London has ever seen.
To welcome our men back home.

25:39.962 --> 25:41.962
Let's hope it's soon, Rose.

25:54.242 --> 25:58.402
I have business contacts in town.

25:59.882 --> 26:02.322
You need to make a good impression.

26:03.322 --> 26:05.402
Mm. Good girl.

26:07.282 --> 26:09.282
Hurry up.

26:11.922 --> 26:15.042
By the way, Harry Selfridge asked me
to invite you

26:15.082 --> 26:17.522
to a card game tomorrow evening at
Delphine's club.

26:17.562 --> 26:20.842
Although I'm sure you're far too
busy for cards these days.

26:20.882 --> 26:22.882
On the contrary.

26:22.922 --> 26:27.722
I will absolutely relish giving that
Yank the trouncing of his life.

26:38.869 --> 26:41.789
Oh, it's wonderful!

26:41.829 --> 26:45.989
Harry, look at the new uniform
sample. Isn't it just perfect?

26:47.749 --> 26:50.629
It looks very smart
and fit for purpose.

26:50.669 --> 26:53.149
Thank you, ladies. You both have done
a great job.

26:53.189 --> 26:56.029
The girls will be thrilled.
I can't wait to show 'em.

26:56.069 --> 27:00.069
Good. I just wanted to make sure I
understood your needs properly first.

27:00.109 --> 27:03.029
You certainly did.
Thank you, Mrs Selfridge.

27:04.429 --> 27:06.069
Good morning, Ma, Pa.

27:06.109 --> 27:08.109
Mr Selfridge.

27:08.149 --> 27:10.989
It's our pleasure.
See you after rifle training, Ma.

27:11.029 --> 27:13.029
Yes, dear.

27:16.789 --> 27:18.789
You didn't tell him, did you?

27:18.829 --> 27:21.829
No. I thought I'd keep it as a
little surprise.

27:42.269 --> 27:44.229
You wanted to see me,
Mr Selfridge?

27:44.269 --> 27:46.349
I'll get straight to the point,
Mr Thackeray.

27:46.389 --> 27:49.189
We need to look at the way forward
for the fashion department.

27:49.229 --> 27:52.629
No doubt Monsieur Leclair has been
complaining about me.

27:52.669 --> 27:54.709
He said you're not listening to him.

27:57.989 --> 28:00.509
Lady Mae is one of our most
influential customers.

28:00.549 --> 28:03.709
She was not happy at all with what
you had to offer her yesterday.

28:03.749 --> 28:06.229
I showed her the most
wonderful creations.

28:06.269 --> 28:08.309
They just didn't suit her mood.

28:08.349 --> 28:10.829
It is your job to suit HER mood.

28:10.869 --> 28:12.869
Not the other way around.

28:12.909 --> 28:15.349
The customer is always right.

28:15.389 --> 28:19.549
Now I need for you to sit down with
Mister Leclair

28:19.589 --> 28:21.589
and go over the new samples.

28:21.629 --> 28:23.629
Of course, Mr Selfridge.

28:29.789 --> 28:32.229
Will that be all?
I sincerely hope so.

28:55.629 --> 28:57.629
Looking for Monsieur Leclair?

28:57.669 --> 28:59.669
I think I may have seen him with you
before.

29:00.669 --> 29:02.669
Am I on the right floor?

29:02.709 --> 29:05.749
One floor up. But I'd be happy to
pass a message.

29:06.989 --> 29:08.989
That won't be necessary.

29:18.189 --> 29:21.309
I told you not to come here.
You could have telephoned.

29:21.349 --> 29:24.069
This particular information
is best delivered in person.

29:24.109 --> 29:26.389
I've drawn you a map with the
address.

29:26.429 --> 29:28.429
The rest is up to you now.

31:15.389 --> 31:17.389
Can I help you?

31:18.989 --> 31:22.509
Actually, I was wondering what that
gentleman was looking for?

31:22.549 --> 31:25.269
Might I ask what business
is that of yours?

31:32.509 --> 31:35.309
He was asking about a woman.
But she left.

31:35.349 --> 31:36.949
A couple of days ago.

31:36.989 --> 31:38.989
Where did she go?

31:39.029 --> 31:41.109
Probably back to Germany
for all I know.

31:41.149 --> 31:44.389
Germany? That's where
he said he saw her last.

31:45.789 --> 31:47.789
Do you think he might be up to
something?

32:02.349 --> 32:04.229
Is everything all right,
Mr Thackeray?

32:07.709 --> 32:11.389
I have strong reason to believe
that Monsieur Leclair is up
to something untoward.

32:12.469 --> 32:15.469
What are you talking about?

32:16.749 --> 32:19.429
Don't you ever wonder where he's
been for five years?

32:19.469 --> 32:21.869
He's been in America.

32:21.909 --> 32:23.909
That's what he's telling everyone.

32:23.949 --> 32:27.429
I still don't get your point,
Mr Thackeray.

32:27.469 --> 32:30.669
My point is that you all think he's
so wonderful.

32:30.709 --> 32:33.589
And maybe he was when he was working
here five years ago,

32:33.629 --> 32:35.869
but what I see is a difficult,
irascible man,

32:35.909 --> 32:37.909
who's hiding something.

32:54.029 --> 32:56.069
It's harder than it looks.
Yes, sir.

32:56.109 --> 32:59.389
Yeah. You really just need to look
down the sights,

32:59.429 --> 33:02.629
keep very still and then slowly
squeeze the trigger.

33:02.669 --> 33:04.829
Ma! I didn't know you were here.

33:04.869 --> 33:06.869
Can I?

33:06.909 --> 33:08.989
I used to shoot all the time in
Chicago...

33:10.149 --> 33:12.149
..when I was a girl.

33:17.389 --> 33:19.029
Ten!

33:19.069 --> 33:21.069
A bullseye, Mrs Selfridge.

33:21.109 --> 33:24.069
There's a lot more to your mother
than you might think, Gordon.

33:28.789 --> 33:31.669
This really was an excellent idea,
Mr Crabb.

33:31.709 --> 33:33.709
My son is so happy firing a weapon.

33:33.749 --> 33:36.829
We're all conscious of self-defence
these days, Mrs Selfridge.

33:36.869 --> 33:40.269
Got so many volunteers I've had to
introduce a rota.

33:40.309 --> 33:43.829
Mrs Selfridge! Who'd have thought
women with guns?

33:47.349 --> 33:49.069
Thank you. If it wasn't for you,

33:49.109 --> 33:51.109
we'd never get to do anything
like this.

33:57.829 --> 33:59.229
Ah, Mr Crabb.
Come in.

33:59.269 --> 34:01.269
You wanted to see me, Mr Selfridge?

34:01.309 --> 34:03.189
How's the rifle training coming
along?

34:03.229 --> 34:04.309
A great success, Chief.

34:04.349 --> 34:06.869
I've rarely seen such enthusiasm in
the staff.

34:06.909 --> 34:09.268
Well done.
Oh, and Mr Crabb?

34:09.309 --> 34:12.429
Yes? I understand it's your birthday
today.

34:13.949 --> 34:15.949
Indeed it is.

34:17.349 --> 34:19.748
Hm. You must be very proud.

34:20.748 --> 34:22.909
You've had a long and distinguished
career.

34:22.949 --> 34:24.748
Before you say anymore,
Mr Selfridge,

34:24.789 --> 34:27.429
I've been expecting that you might
need me to retire soon.

34:27.469 --> 34:29.509
I realise that time
has crept up on me.

34:29.549 --> 34:31.549
The store will need new blood.

34:31.589 --> 34:34.349
A diamond-tipped pen for your years
of service.

34:34.389 --> 34:36.469
Happy birthday, Mr Crabb.

34:40.589 --> 34:42.589
Thank you, Mr Selfridge.

34:42.629 --> 34:44.629
I'm truly honoured.

34:46.188 --> 34:48.909
I want you to know that despite my
advancing years,

34:48.949 --> 34:51.589
I'm still wholly committed to my
role here at the store.

34:51.629 --> 34:53.989
I'm not yet ready to hang up my
boots.

34:55.309 --> 34:58.549
I really don't think we'd know what
to do without you here at the store.

34:58.589 --> 35:01.069
I'm afraid you're going to have to go
on as long as I am.

35:07.189 --> 35:09.869
While there's a breath in my body,
Mr Selfridge, I will.

35:09.909 --> 35:12.869
I only hope everyone else thinks I
can, too.

35:14.709 --> 35:16.709
Mr Thackeray.

35:18.869 --> 35:22.029
You'll report to me early tomorrow
morning before the store opens.

35:22.069 --> 35:24.109
We're going to go through this
fashion plate.

35:24.149 --> 35:26.149
If you say so, Monsieur Leclair.

35:34.389 --> 35:36.829
I never knew Miss Mardle was such a
big game hunter.

35:38.349 --> 35:40.349
I know it's a bit odd.

35:41.189 --> 35:42.909
But you know, Victor, it's really
nice

35:42.949 --> 35:45.589
coming back here after a rotten day
at work.

35:46.789 --> 35:48.829
And I can't stop thinking about
George.

35:50.069 --> 35:53.789
You're lucky, you've got this big
family. He's all I've got.

35:55.549 --> 35:57.749
Come on.
Show me around.

36:04.189 --> 36:06.189
Thank you.

36:11.589 --> 36:15.069
Ah, Lord Loxley. Good of you to come
on such short notice.

36:15.109 --> 36:17.629
I do enjoy a game of cards.

36:17.669 --> 36:19.669
I hear that you do, too.

36:19.709 --> 36:22.269
Yes.
Glass of wine, Lord - Oh.

36:24.549 --> 36:26.469
Thank you.
My pleasure.

36:26.509 --> 36:28.989
Mr Selfridge.
Miles Edgerton.

36:29.029 --> 36:30.469
I've heard a lot about you.

36:30.509 --> 36:32.509
And I you, Lord Edgerton.

36:32.549 --> 36:34.549
Thank you.

36:34.589 --> 36:39.149
I was wondering if your procurement
committee could put me to good use.

36:39.189 --> 36:41.709
Oh. In what manner?

36:41.749 --> 36:45.869
Well, I could source kit for the
troops at a fair and reasonable price

36:45.909 --> 36:47.109
for the government.

36:47.149 --> 36:49.149
Of course, I'd waive all commission.

36:49.189 --> 36:50.709
Very generous offer, Selfridge.

36:50.749 --> 36:54.269
Well, Lord Loxley knows that I've
given him some sound advice

36:54.309 --> 36:56.229
and I'm sure he'd be happy to vouch
for me.

36:56.269 --> 36:58.269
What do you say, Loxley?

36:59.469 --> 37:01.469
Another time, perhaps.

37:01.509 --> 37:04.789
There isn't a vacant position
at the moment.

37:04.829 --> 37:06.869
Well, I heard there's one coming up
shortly.

37:06.909 --> 37:09.069
Already spoken for, I'm afraid.

37:09.109 --> 37:11.389
By someone we already know.

37:12.269 --> 37:14.269
Gentlemen, please take your seats.

37:16.069 --> 37:18.149
Are you saying you don't know me,
Lord Loxley?

37:18.189 --> 37:22.229
It didn't seem to worry you when you
asked me for my manufacturing contacts.

37:22.269 --> 37:25.189
I didn't ask you.
You offered it.

37:26.749 --> 37:28.749
You were so eager to help.

37:28.789 --> 37:30.789
Your antes, please, gentlemen.

37:37.149 --> 37:40.669
Bill! What an
unexpected surprise.

37:40.709 --> 37:44.669
For those of you unfamiliar,
this is Bill Summertime.

37:44.709 --> 37:47.589
Evening, gentlemen.
Good evening.

37:50.709 --> 37:52.869
Jim, can you get Mr Summertime a
chair?

37:59.309 --> 38:01.349
Gentlemen, it's no-limit betting.

38:10.683 --> 38:14.323
Erm, did you want to talk to me
about the restaurant?

38:14.363 --> 38:16.363
Yes, I did.

38:16.403 --> 38:19.203
It's not going to be easy.
There's quite a lot of debt.

38:19.243 --> 38:21.243
It would be yours.

38:21.283 --> 38:24.043
Needs an overhaul.
It'd be hard graft.

38:24.083 --> 38:26.203
I suppose that's a good thing.

38:26.243 --> 38:30.803
You know, it would be your own
little pile of bricks and mortar.

38:31.883 --> 38:33.603
You think I should do it?

38:33.643 --> 38:35.643
Yes, I do.

38:42.043 --> 38:44.043
Can I ask you a question?

38:44.923 --> 38:46.923
You and Mr Leclair.

38:47.923 --> 38:49.923
Is there something between you?

38:49.963 --> 38:53.643
Er... there was.

38:53.683 --> 38:57.443
A long time ago, but erm... not
anymore.

39:10.963 --> 39:12.963
I stand.

39:13.003 --> 39:15.003
I stand.

39:15.043 --> 39:17.043
Two cards.

39:20.163 --> 39:22.163
I'll take one.

39:27.323 --> 39:29.323
Check.

39:33.163 --> 39:35.163
I bet...

39:37.883 --> 39:39.883
..£100.

39:43.483 --> 39:45.483
I fold.

39:46.283 --> 39:48.283
I'm out.

39:52.363 --> 39:54.363
I'll call your £100.

39:56.563 --> 39:58.563
And I raise you...

39:58.603 --> 40:00.603
£100.

40:02.883 --> 40:04.883
Fold.

40:13.923 --> 40:15.923
Re-raise...

40:17.803 --> 40:19.803
..all in.

40:22.803 --> 40:24.803
£375.

40:48.763 --> 40:50.763
Call.

40:52.963 --> 40:55.803
Straight to queen.

41:13.003 --> 41:15.003
Full house.

41:15.043 --> 41:17.043
Kings over aces.

41:22.283 --> 41:24.963
Enough for one night.
Well done, Selfridge.

41:28.483 --> 41:30.083
And Miss Day?

41:30.123 --> 41:32.683
What?
Miss Day.

41:34.803 --> 41:36.803
Thank you for the evening.

41:36.843 --> 41:38.843
My pleasure, Lord Loxley.

41:42.083 --> 41:44.083
Goodnight, Mr Selfridge.

41:49.603 --> 41:51.603
Do you know what, Agnes?

41:51.643 --> 41:53.643
I'm glad I talked to you.

41:53.683 --> 41:55.683
I am going to make a go of the
restaurant.

41:56.683 --> 41:58.683
Good for you.

42:00.523 --> 42:02.523
Victor...

42:02.563 --> 42:06.803
why did you ask me about Mr Leclair?

42:08.483 --> 42:10.483
Why?
Mm.

42:10.523 --> 42:12.523
I want to ask you out, Agnes.

42:15.043 --> 42:18.163
Don't... don't you need to ask me,
then?

42:18.203 --> 42:20.203
No.

42:21.563 --> 42:23.563
I can see the answer in your eyes.

42:45.163 --> 42:47.163
Goodnight, Agnes Towler.

42:58.443 --> 43:00.043
You keep a happy house here.

43:00.083 --> 43:02.083
Oh. Well, thank you.

43:05.003 --> 43:07.003
No, thank you.

43:07.043 --> 43:09.523
This evening you made me forget my
troubles.

43:10.963 --> 43:12.963
A long time since I've known that
feeling.

43:28.123 --> 43:30.123
Good evening, sir.
Good evening.

43:35.643 --> 43:38.563
How was cards? Do we have to sell
the house?

43:39.403 --> 43:41.403
I won.

43:41.443 --> 43:43.443
A useful day all round, then.

43:56.723 --> 43:58.723
Goodnight.

44:02.083 --> 44:05.643
Let's see if I can
find a use for YOU, Mr Selfridge.

44:13.723 --> 44:17.643
Bill Summertime.
I met Harry Selfridge tonight.

44:18.843 --> 44:20.843
I think he could be our man.

44:22.203 --> 44:25.563
I have a job for you. It's for a
charity concert at Selfridge's.

44:25.603 --> 44:27.123
For you, I will.

44:27.163 --> 44:29.163
You've been receiving visitors?

44:30.603 --> 44:32.443
I don't trust you, Loxley.

44:32.483 --> 44:34.803
You've done absolutely nothing for
this country.

44:34.843 --> 44:37.803
People are saying things about you.
This country's gone mad.

44:37.843 --> 44:39.443
But you are hiding something.

44:39.483 --> 44:41.483
He returned just before the war
started.

44:41.523 --> 44:44.043
So why did he come back? It's vital
to the war effort,

44:44.083 --> 44:45.643
that we know what the enemy is up
to.

44:45.683 --> 44:48.603
It would be a good time for you to
take a little business trip.
