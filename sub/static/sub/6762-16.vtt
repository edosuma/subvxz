02:15.169 --> 02:16.497
This is Brandon's locker.

02:17.337 --> 02:19.210
Not anymore.
They just assigned it to me.

02:19.381 --> 02:22.417
But l could be Brandon if you want.

02:27.137 --> 02:28.299
Morning, Andrea.

02:28.472 --> 02:30.298
Brandon, what are you doing
over here?

02:30.474 --> 02:33.308
l heard locker values appreciate
quicker on this side of the quad.

02:33.518 --> 02:35.225
Oh, you mean you're ducking Emily.

02:37.605 --> 02:39.264
l just don't wanna deal with it
right now.

02:39.482 --> 02:42.648
Brandon, avoidance
is how you're dealing with it.

02:43.694 --> 02:45.900
l don't know, l'm just not
an in-your-face type of guy.

02:46.071 --> 02:50.234
Hey, Bran, why don't you get
that ugly mug out of my face?

02:50.408 --> 02:52.981
Man, what did you have for breakfast,
a Skunk McMuffin?

02:53.994 --> 02:55.785
That's my fave.

02:55.996 --> 02:58.665
- Good morning, campers.
- Morning, ladies.

02:58.874 --> 03:00.996
Before l sign off, remember:

03:01.209 --> 03:03.165
Beverly High
may trounce West Beverly High

03:03.336 --> 03:05.542
at the annual homecoming game
next week.

03:05.755 --> 03:08.245
That doesn't mean we can't have
the best floats in the parade.

03:08.424 --> 03:10.546
So get out your chicken wire,
your toilet paper,

03:10.759 --> 03:12.798
and we'll see you at halftime.

03:13.011 --> 03:14.588
Do we really have to enter
this contest?

03:14.763 --> 03:16.221
Yes. lt'll be fun.

03:18.474 --> 03:20.798
You guys, l'm not exactly a member
of the pep club either,

03:20.976 --> 03:23.300
but, you know, l really think
we have a chance of winning.

03:23.479 --> 03:24.723
- You think so?
- Yeah.

03:24.896 --> 03:27.469
So can we have the lumber delivered
to your house?

03:27.649 --> 03:29.392
- Wait a minute--
- Hold on, Brandon.

03:29.567 --> 03:31.108
You're the only family
in Beverly Hills

03:31.277 --> 03:33.850
that actually has tools
in their tool shed.

03:34.030 --> 03:36.651
Are Brenda and Dylan
committed to this?

03:38.242 --> 03:39.866
Brandon?

03:41.578 --> 03:44.068
Yeah, actually,
Brenda designed the float.

03:44.289 --> 03:47.075
ln that case, we'll be there. See you.

03:47.291 --> 03:49.662
- See you, bro.
- Later.

03:49.835 --> 03:53.369
Andrea, you don't feel like editing
the sports page today, do you?

03:53.547 --> 03:58.208
lt's not gonna get any easier
unless you tell her the truth.

03:58.384 --> 03:59.759
Yeah.

03:59.969 --> 04:02.638
''And have you noticed
that all the rich kids north of Sunset

04:02.805 --> 04:05.509
have the biggest egos
and the smallest brains?''

04:05.682 --> 04:07.140
Oh, God, don't tell me.

04:07.309 --> 04:09.384
Afraid so. Phantom pen pal
strikes again.

04:09.561 --> 04:11.387
What's this, the fourth letter
we've gotten?

04:11.563 --> 04:14.232
Are you kidding? This is like
the seventh in the last two weeks.

04:14.440 --> 04:16.396
l think we should give this guy
his own column.

04:16.608 --> 04:19.774
- You would, Griffin.
- No, no, this is pure social satire.

04:19.945 --> 04:21.983
''Wouldn't it be hysterical to see

04:22.155 --> 04:24.063
what your basic West Beverly
princesses would do

04:24.240 --> 04:27.406
if somebody slashed their BMW
convertibles to shreds?''

04:27.577 --> 04:29.035
This guy's twisted.

04:29.245 --> 04:31.403
Really, this is not my idea of satire.

04:31.580 --> 04:35.078
Come on, people, we got a paper
to put out. Let's do it.

04:35.250 --> 04:37.823
- Brandon?
- Yeah?

04:39.087 --> 04:41.921
Why'd you move your locker?

04:43.549 --> 04:46.834
- You wanna know the real reason?
- Yeah.

04:47.636 --> 04:49.462
Well, l was just spending
so much time here,

04:49.638 --> 04:51.429
l figured it would be more convenient.

04:55.476 --> 04:56.851
Excuse me.

05:03.650 --> 05:06.319
Brandon, how about going out
tonight?

05:06.486 --> 05:07.766
l can't, Emily.

05:07.945 --> 05:10.352
Come on, it's been two weeks
since we've been together.

05:10.531 --> 05:14.148
No, l really can't.
l have to study tonight.

05:14.326 --> 05:16.484
Well, how about l come over
and we can study together?

05:16.661 --> 05:20.076
l really don't think we'd get
much studying done that way.

05:20.248 --> 05:23.331
- Listen, l gotta go.
- Brandon, aren't we ever gonna--?

05:25.586 --> 05:27.494
Okay.

05:27.671 --> 05:31.086
You have to study. l understand.

05:31.258 --> 05:33.084
l'll see you later.

05:50.525 --> 05:52.647
Dylan, time-out.

05:53.485 --> 05:56.983
Okay, coach,
l'll sit the bench for a while.

05:57.155 --> 06:00.440
- Time-out's over.
- No, Dylan, Dylan, come on.

06:00.617 --> 06:03.653
We're supposed to be studying history,
not sex education.

06:03.870 --> 06:06.443
l'm sorry. There's just something
about this Louisiana Purchase.

06:06.622 --> 06:07.784
You know, it drives me wild.

06:07.957 --> 06:12.167
Dylan, l'm serious.
We should be doing more than this.

06:12.335 --> 06:14.410
You know, l think so too.
Let's go upstairs.

06:14.587 --> 06:15.618
No.

06:15.838 --> 06:19.206
Look, l mean more than making out
all the time.

06:19.383 --> 06:22.300
And not that l don't like it,
because l do.

06:22.469 --> 06:23.749
l like it a lot.

06:24.513 --> 06:26.719
lt's just that it's practically
all we ever do anymore.

06:26.890 --> 06:29.380
Oh, that's not true. l mean,
last weekend, we went to a movie.

06:29.559 --> 06:31.467
Yeah, and we barely saw any of it.

06:31.644 --> 06:32.888
Well, that's not my fault.

06:33.062 --> 06:35.813
l mean, l wasn't exactly kissing myself,
you know.

06:36.023 --> 06:38.430
Look, all l'm saying is
we should make a little extra effort

06:38.609 --> 06:42.653
to do something interesting, cultural.

06:43.780 --> 06:47.824
So we won't feel guilty
when we're making out all the time.

06:48.409 --> 06:49.653
Exactly.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.327
Hello.

06:59.919 --> 07:01.578
Hello?

07:09.010 --> 07:10.634
Yeah?

07:13.514 --> 07:15.091
Great.

07:18.185 --> 07:21.019
l hope you're having a good time.
l'm about to call the phone company.

07:21.188 --> 07:22.847
They're gonna track you down,
you got that?

07:23.023 --> 07:26.521
Yeah, l got it. And you gotta get out
of the house a little more, Walsh.

07:26.734 --> 07:28.726
- Steve?
- Yeah, hey, what's going on, Walsh?

07:28.903 --> 07:30.610
You got yourself a heavy breather?

07:30.779 --> 07:32.438
No, hang-ups.

07:32.614 --> 07:35.400
Why don't you come to the Peach Pit?
You won't worry about it here.

07:35.617 --> 07:36.731
No. l'm studying, man.

07:36.951 --> 07:39.192
Studying? lt's Friday night.
That's immoral.

07:39.412 --> 07:42.081
Well, l already put in a 30-hour
work week behind the counter.

07:42.290 --> 07:45.492
Why don't you come, be a customer?
See how the other half lives.

07:47.211 --> 07:51.671
Forget it. l'm not gonna bring you
any hot sauce. You know where it is.

07:51.840 --> 07:55.290
Nat, show this young man respect.
He's a paying customer.

07:55.509 --> 07:59.553
No, he's not. He's part of the family.
And it's on the house.

07:59.722 --> 08:01.097
Both of you.

08:01.306 --> 08:03.097
- Oh, well, thanks, Gramps.
- Thanks.

08:05.769 --> 08:07.428
l've gotta eat with you more often.

08:07.603 --> 08:10.639
Anyway, listen,
if she's not getting the message,

08:10.815 --> 08:12.474
you just have to be firm, spell it out.

08:12.650 --> 08:16.267
Tell her adios, sayonara,
au revoir, finito.

08:16.445 --> 08:17.855
The United Nations approach.

08:18.530 --> 08:21.067
Tell her it doesn't work,
and then it's over. Period.

08:21.240 --> 08:23.362
Easy to say, hard to do.

08:26.287 --> 08:28.409
Easy to do. Look who just walked in.

08:29.498 --> 08:31.786
Oh, God. l told her l was studying.

08:31.958 --> 08:33.996
Be firm.

08:34.210 --> 08:37.827
Hey, what a coincidence. l thought you
were committed to the books tonight.

08:38.047 --> 08:39.587
Yeah, just taking a little break.

08:39.756 --> 08:42.461
My parents are out of town for
the weekend and l'm here for dinner.

08:42.634 --> 08:43.712
Mind if l join you?

08:43.927 --> 08:46.713
Well, why don't you take my seat?
l gotta make a few phone calls.

08:46.888 --> 08:48.927
- Thanks, Steve.
- Sure.

08:53.936 --> 08:56.853
lt's so weird. l was just thinking
about you and here you are.

08:57.022 --> 09:00.355
- Yeah.
- That's called kismet, you know.

09:00.567 --> 09:02.974
When two lovers are destined
to be together forever--

09:03.194 --> 09:06.360
Look, Emily, l don't know how else
to say this, except just say it,

09:06.530 --> 09:08.189
so l hope you understand.

09:10.242 --> 09:11.570
- Brandon--
- But l don't think

09:11.743 --> 09:14.280
we should see each other anymore.

09:18.749 --> 09:22.117
Look, l know you're really mad about
that drug thing, and l can't blame you.

09:22.294 --> 09:23.752
No, l'm not mad.

09:23.921 --> 09:25.794
Well, you should be.

09:26.006 --> 09:28.757
Because it was the stupidest thing
l ever did in my life,

09:28.925 --> 09:32.922
and l am so incredibly sorry.

09:35.055 --> 09:38.008
l love you.
You know that, don't you?

09:38.225 --> 09:40.715
You know that l'd never do anything
to hurt you.

09:40.894 --> 09:44.938
Yeah, l know, but l have to go
with what l feel.

09:45.106 --> 09:47.347
Brandon, please.

09:47.566 --> 09:50.566
Why can't you find it in your heart
to forgive me?

09:50.778 --> 09:53.351
Why can't you give me
a second chance?

09:53.572 --> 09:57.320
Please, l'll do anything. Anything.

09:57.492 --> 09:59.780
Just give me a second chance.

10:03.831 --> 10:06.748
l wish it was that simple. l really do.

10:09.753 --> 10:11.544
But that doesn't mean
we can't be friends.

10:12.630 --> 10:14.586
Good friends.

10:16.091 --> 10:19.257
Maybe if you just--
We cool out for a couple of weeks

10:19.428 --> 10:21.835
and you have time to think
before you make a final decision.

10:22.013 --> 10:25.547
Emily, it's all l have been thinking
about for the last two weeks.

10:26.184 --> 10:30.015
And l'm really sorry,
but it's just the way it's gotta be.

10:39.487 --> 10:41.858
lf l had a fairy godmother
and she could grant me one wish,

10:42.031 --> 10:44.319
it would be to turn back the clock
and start over.

10:44.491 --> 10:46.317
Yeah, l know how you feel.

10:46.493 --> 10:48.117
Do you?

10:50.205 --> 10:51.948
Good night, Emily.

10:52.540 --> 10:55.540
Oh, my God. Brandon, look.

11:01.423 --> 11:04.459
lsn't this a perfect way to end
a perfectly marvellous week?

11:05.760 --> 11:07.301
Any way to salvage it?

11:07.512 --> 11:09.883
l'm afraid it's a goner.

11:11.015 --> 11:13.221
Probably the same guy
that wants to slash the BMWs.

11:13.434 --> 11:14.762
l wouldn't worry about it, Emily.

11:14.935 --> 11:17.057
You're not exactly
a West Beverly princess.

11:18.938 --> 11:21.808
Why didn't he just slash my throat
while he was at it?

11:21.983 --> 11:23.690
Hey.

11:27.112 --> 11:30.562
lt'll be okay.
Don't worry, l'll take care of it.

11:30.740 --> 11:32.020
Don't worry.

11:36.495 --> 11:39.614
Well, here are some towels,
and that's just about it.

11:39.790 --> 11:41.034
Thanks, Mrs. Walsh.

11:41.208 --> 11:43.532
But you and Brandon didn't have to go
to all this trouble.

11:43.710 --> 11:45.334
Oh, it's no trouble. lt's our pleasure.

11:45.503 --> 11:47.661
You get some rest.
You'll feel better in the morning.

11:47.839 --> 11:48.870
Thanks.

11:49.048 --> 11:52.546
And if you need anything,
feel free to call the concierge.

12:00.100 --> 12:03.764
You know, even the Holiday lnn
gets a little warning

12:03.936 --> 12:05.133
before a guest checks in.

12:05.313 --> 12:07.305
What was l supposed
to do, Brenda?

12:07.481 --> 12:09.437
Oh, let's see,
drop her off at her house?

12:09.608 --> 12:11.149
Her parents are out of town.

12:11.568 --> 12:12.943
Poor baby. Afraid of the dark?

12:13.153 --> 12:15.904
Come on, Brenda, getting your tyre
slashed is a very creepy thing.

12:16.114 --> 12:17.524
Anyway, it's like Mom says:

12:17.740 --> 12:19.732
lf we can't show compassion
for people in trouble,

12:19.909 --> 12:20.988
why are we put on earth?

12:21.201 --> 12:23.157
Yeah, well, Mom didn't see you
as high as a kite

12:23.328 --> 12:25.569
on the Euphoria Emily slipped
into your drink.

12:25.789 --> 12:27.366
Do you have to bring that up
every time?

12:27.540 --> 12:29.448
- Yes, because l don't trust her.
- Brenda--

12:29.667 --> 12:32.288
And l don't like the way
she's taking advantage of you.

12:32.461 --> 12:34.204
- Are you finished?
- Yes, l am.

12:34.380 --> 12:36.372
Hold on, l wanna say something.

12:37.466 --> 12:39.292
You and Dylan
are the only two people who know

12:39.468 --> 12:41.009
that she spiked my drink at the club.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.335
l'd like to keep it that way.

12:44.055 --> 12:46.130
Brandon, why are you
so into protecting her?

12:46.349 --> 12:47.926
l don't wanna see her
become the outcast

12:48.100 --> 12:50.092
just because l break up with her.

12:50.269 --> 12:53.186
She's not a bad person.
She's really not.

12:55.106 --> 12:56.386
Fine.

14:01.498 --> 14:03.905
ls the concierge open for business?

14:04.125 --> 14:05.832
Emily.

14:06.044 --> 14:07.952
Hi.

14:18.805 --> 14:23.680
No, Emily. We're not doing this.
You better go.

14:23.893 --> 14:26.383
- Brandon.
- What do you want?

14:26.562 --> 14:29.266
Want to be with me tonight then have
me break up with you tomorrow?

14:29.439 --> 14:31.265
ls that what you want?

14:31.441 --> 14:32.721
lf we make love right now,

14:32.901 --> 14:35.735
l promise you won't wanna
break up with me.

14:38.405 --> 14:41.773
Emily, to make love,
l have to be in love.

14:49.749 --> 14:50.780
Okay.

14:51.959 --> 14:53.666
l'll leave.

14:58.924 --> 15:00.832
But remember, Brandon.

15:02.093 --> 15:03.884
l love you.

15:22.277 --> 15:25.230
Oh, no, not at all.
She's safe and sound.

15:25.405 --> 15:27.693
Yes, Emily spent the night here.

15:27.866 --> 15:30.190
lt's no problem at all.

15:30.368 --> 15:32.692
Well, we felt with her tyre
being slashed--

15:32.870 --> 15:34.778
Thank you, Mrs. Walsh.
l'll talk to her.

15:34.955 --> 15:37.706
- Of course.
- Hi.

15:37.874 --> 15:39.866
Didn't you get the message?

15:40.043 --> 15:42.747
No, my tyre was slashed.

15:43.504 --> 15:45.163
Well, Brandon drove me.

15:46.382 --> 15:48.173
No, Mom, l slept in Brenda's room.

15:48.759 --> 15:50.039
His sister.

15:51.136 --> 15:53.805
Yeah, it was fine. Don't worry.

15:54.014 --> 15:55.673
l'll be home soon.

15:56.391 --> 15:59.142
Okay, love you. Bye-bye.

15:59.352 --> 16:00.680
ls everything all right?

16:00.853 --> 16:03.723
Yeah, sure.
They just got home early.

16:07.275 --> 16:09.101
Steve, you're doing a great job,

16:09.277 --> 16:12.443
but do you think you could look
a little more carpenteresque?

16:12.613 --> 16:16.610
Silver, l'm warning you.
Off with the video. Now.

16:18.118 --> 16:20.988
- lt's important to record this.
- But why?

16:21.163 --> 16:23.369
Because some West Beverly floats
have been accused

16:23.540 --> 16:25.331
of being built by professionals.

16:25.500 --> 16:27.824
Well, this tape will put
that notion to rest.

16:30.713 --> 16:32.669
Hi, guys. Sorry l'm late.

16:32.881 --> 16:34.339
What's with the outfit, Donna?

16:34.508 --> 16:37.342
Oh, well, Andrea said carpentry.

16:37.510 --> 16:40.344
All right, Donna,
you can help me paint.

16:40.930 --> 16:42.305
Paint?

16:42.473 --> 16:45.556
l'm not getting paint on these clothes.

16:51.773 --> 16:54.726
- l can't believe she's wearing that.
- What?

16:54.901 --> 16:57.652
That's Brandon's prized shirt
from the '87 Series.

16:57.820 --> 16:59.978
l mean, he's gonna go ballistic.

17:00.155 --> 17:02.776
Talk about a fashion statement.

17:04.492 --> 17:07.326
- Hey, everybody.
- Hi.

17:10.664 --> 17:13.913
Yo, Dylan, we should probably
power-sand those boards

17:14.126 --> 17:15.916
before we put them in place.

17:18.171 --> 17:19.333
Cute shirt.

17:19.505 --> 17:22.540
l spent last night here with Brandon,
l had nothing to wear this morning.

17:22.717 --> 17:24.045
Pardon me?

17:24.218 --> 17:27.088
Brandon invited me to stay over
last night, and things got a little...

17:27.262 --> 17:28.969
Well, you know.

17:29.139 --> 17:31.012
He's something special.

17:31.182 --> 17:33.340
l gotta check the paint.

17:37.146 --> 17:39.932
- l thought you blew her off.
- Yeah, well, she blew back in.

17:40.107 --> 17:42.680
- You didn't--?
- l didn't lay a hand on her.

17:42.859 --> 17:44.767
l can't believe you'd let someone
actually touch

17:44.945 --> 17:48.645
the 1 987 World Championship shirt.

17:48.823 --> 17:51.396
She won't leave me alone, man,
and she won't take a hint.

17:51.575 --> 17:53.614
l've broken up with her
in clear and certain terms.

17:53.786 --> 17:55.410
Yeah, well,
obviously not clear enough.

17:55.579 --> 17:58.449
What am l supposed to do, be brutal?
That's not me, man.

17:58.623 --> 18:00.366
No, you're still trying
to be Brandon Walsh,

18:00.542 --> 18:02.036
the all-American nice guy, right?

18:02.210 --> 18:04.118
What can l say?

18:04.295 --> 18:07.165
You're afraid of what would happen
to her if you dumped her.

18:07.339 --> 18:08.583
l guess.

18:08.757 --> 18:12.836
Man, l'm afraid of all the things
that could happen to you if you don't.

18:18.974 --> 18:20.254
Boy...

18:20.476 --> 18:23.097
Come on, you two, pitch in.
l wanna see you sweat.

18:23.312 --> 18:25.683
- Oh, forget it.
- No way!

18:25.897 --> 18:28.019
Yeah, well, l wanna see you sweat.

18:28.191 --> 18:30.598
Dylan, not now.
My parents are right over there.

18:30.776 --> 18:33.183
Okay. l'll have to wait till l get you
alone at the concert.

18:33.362 --> 18:37.275
- Dylan, come on, you promised.
- l was just kidding.

18:39.826 --> 18:41.023
You're avoiding me.

18:41.786 --> 18:43.327
You know, Emily,
between me and Brenda,

18:43.496 --> 18:45.571
we must have four dozen T-shirts
and sweatshirts.

18:45.748 --> 18:47.491
Why did you have to choose
my favourite one?

18:48.083 --> 18:49.327
Makes me feel closer to you.

18:49.501 --> 18:51.908
- l won't do anything to it.
- Except get paint all over it.

18:52.087 --> 18:55.170
- Little club soda, it will come right out.
- Just forget it, okay?

18:55.381 --> 18:58.417
- No big deal. l'll take it off.
- Emily, what is it with you?

18:58.634 --> 19:01.587
Are you just trying to be funny,
or are you trying to drive me crazy?

19:25.408 --> 19:28.527
Well, we're off to a promising start.

19:28.702 --> 19:30.575
lt's so...

19:30.746 --> 19:32.738
Romantic?

20:17.495 --> 20:20.032
l feel so sorry for the people
sitting behind us.

20:20.206 --> 20:21.865
They must've thought
we were so immature.

20:22.041 --> 20:24.614
We couldn't go 20 minutes
without pawing each other.

20:24.793 --> 20:26.203
You guys? Never.

20:26.378 --> 20:28.999
You know, the funny thing is
that we actually liked the music.

20:29.172 --> 20:31.211
Maybe that was our problem,
we liked it too much.

20:31.383 --> 20:33.541
l don't think that was
the problem, Bren.

20:33.718 --> 20:35.876
Anyway, we're gonna give it
another chance next week,

20:36.053 --> 20:37.961
sort of increase our tolerance level.

20:38.139 --> 20:41.009
Sort of like holding your breath
under water.

20:41.183 --> 20:42.380
No.

20:42.559 --> 20:44.218
Brandon.

20:44.394 --> 20:46.053
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:46.229 --> 20:48.517
l need to talk to you.

20:49.524 --> 20:50.899
l'm sorry about your shirt.

20:51.108 --> 20:52.851
And l'm really sorry
about that crazy stunt

20:53.027 --> 20:55.102
of sneaking into your bedroom
the other night.

20:55.320 --> 20:57.526
And l want you to know,
if you never spoke to me again,

20:57.697 --> 20:59.523
l'd understand.

21:00.909 --> 21:03.233
Yeah, we'll speak again, Emily.

21:03.411 --> 21:05.617
Hell, we work
on the same newspaper, right?

21:05.788 --> 21:10.164
Well, l just want you to know
that l'm ready to deal with the situation.

21:11.126 --> 21:12.620
l fell for you hard.

21:12.836 --> 21:17.129
But if it's not gonna work out,
it's not gonna work out, and that's cool.

21:18.632 --> 21:19.960
Friends?

21:22.594 --> 21:24.633
The phantom pen pal strikes again.

21:24.805 --> 21:27.758
Listen, Geraldo, Andrea's worked hard
to keep gossip out of the paper.

21:27.932 --> 21:30.090
l don't think now is the time
to start putting it in.

21:30.268 --> 21:34.217
This ain't gossip, Brandon.
This one is psycho time.

21:34.688 --> 21:37.309
''And it will be my pleasure
to throw gasoline on the fire

21:37.482 --> 21:39.770
that burns this school to the ground.''

21:39.943 --> 21:41.318
And he expects us to print this?

21:41.528 --> 21:44.445
That's what he's demanding, but we're
not gonna give a nut case a forum.

21:44.614 --> 21:47.283
- Hey, like it or not, baby, this is news.
- l'm sorry.

21:47.449 --> 21:50.366
There is nothing newsworthy about
hate mail. Listen to how he ends this.

21:50.536 --> 21:52.943
''And if some of the little bitches
get caught in the flames,

21:53.121 --> 21:54.864
toss me another marshmallow.''

21:55.081 --> 21:57.203
l think we ought to take it
to the police.

22:06.383 --> 22:09.004
Hang on a sec.
Let me turn this thing off.

22:09.177 --> 22:11.169
Hi, sorry about that.

22:11.345 --> 22:12.969
Hello?

22:24.732 --> 22:26.807
Come on, Dad, what's up?
The suspense is killing us.

22:26.984 --> 22:29.439
Wait, wait just a second.
Listen to this.

22:30.404 --> 22:32.941
Hi. lt's me, Brandon.

22:33.907 --> 22:36.065
l was just thinking of you.

22:36.242 --> 22:37.901
lt's Emily.

22:38.119 --> 22:40.158
Your baby blues and that totally
disarming smile

22:40.329 --> 22:43.115
that fills any rainy day l have
with sunshine.

22:45.250 --> 22:47.787
l miss you, Brandon.
l miss being next to you.

22:47.961 --> 22:49.704
The feel of your arms
wrapped around me,

22:49.879 --> 22:53.377
the touch of your skin,
the way you caress my body--

22:53.549 --> 22:56.834
- l think we get the picture, Dad.
- Are you sure?

22:57.011 --> 22:59.382
There's 1 2 more just like it
if you wanna listen to them.

22:59.555 --> 23:00.799
No, thank you, Dad.

23:01.014 --> 23:03.172
So, what the hell
is going on here, Brandon?

23:05.435 --> 23:09.479
Hello. Hello, Emily?
l'm getting sick of this.

23:09.647 --> 23:11.105
We don't know that was her.

23:11.273 --> 23:13.395
Oh, come on, Mom,
it's pretty obvious.

23:13.609 --> 23:16.443
And it's obvious she wanted me and
your mother to hear those messages,

23:16.611 --> 23:18.982
which l don't think is the sign
of a balanced person.

23:19.197 --> 23:21.604
Well, she's been pretty upset
ever since we broke up,

23:21.782 --> 23:23.489
but l talked to her at school today

23:23.659 --> 23:25.532
and she acted like
everything was okay.

23:25.703 --> 23:27.113
The key word being ''acted.''

23:27.287 --> 23:29.243
Well, now, let's not be too harsh.

23:29.456 --> 23:31.662
l mean, Brenda, remember
a few months ago with Dylan?

23:31.833 --> 23:35.035
You said it yourself.
l mean, breaking up is hard to do.

23:35.211 --> 23:37.997
- Honey...
- Mom, that was completely different.

23:38.172 --> 23:40.211
Emily Valentine has stepped
way over the line.

23:40.382 --> 23:44.461
l mean, this isn't about a broken heart.
This is about a fatal attraction.

23:44.636 --> 23:46.960
And how did Michael Douglas
handle it?

23:47.138 --> 23:48.548
Not well.

23:53.685 --> 23:56.140
Hello. Hello?

24:12.285 --> 24:14.775
- Ready?
- Ready, set, go.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.946
Well, you have plenty of energy
this morning.

24:17.164 --> 24:19.120
Well, l got plenty of sleep last night.

24:19.333 --> 24:22.369
Yeah, no phone calls. l guess
your crank caller finally gave up.

24:22.586 --> 24:25.919
Or got put out of business.

24:26.131 --> 24:29.748
You know, Brandon, beating Emily
at her own game for one night is fine,

24:29.926 --> 24:32.499
but you can't go through your life
with your phone off the hook.

24:32.678 --> 24:34.551
l just don't know what to do anymore.

24:34.722 --> 24:36.761
Want me to talk to her?
l'll tell her the score.

24:36.932 --> 24:39.256
Forget it. The way you feel now,
you'd bite her head off.

24:39.476 --> 24:40.886
Well, that would be an improvement.

24:41.060 --> 24:44.143
Look, obviously,
the girl's kind of messed up.

24:44.313 --> 24:45.510
Kind of?

24:45.731 --> 24:48.731
Give me a break.
l mean, she's bothered in the extreme.

24:48.901 --> 24:50.727
The way she sounded
on the answering machine,

24:50.902 --> 24:53.143
l wouldn't be surprised
if she was a hard-core stoner.

24:53.363 --> 24:55.022
Brenda, you don't know that
about her.

24:55.198 --> 24:56.573
You don't know anything about her.

24:56.783 --> 24:58.609
Yeah, well, neither do you.

24:58.784 --> 25:00.657
Have you been
inside her house, Brandon?

25:01.579 --> 25:04.069
Have you met her parents?

25:04.289 --> 25:06.577
Do you know any of her friends
from her old school?

25:09.127 --> 25:12.827
Face it, Brandon.
Nobody knows who this girl is.

25:19.386 --> 25:20.880
What's this?

25:21.054 --> 25:24.754
Oh, l don't know,
it's a little too early for Christmas.

25:24.932 --> 25:27.090
lt has your name on it.

25:28.686 --> 25:30.844
lt's been cleaned and ironed.

25:31.313 --> 25:34.895
Boy, she washes, irons and cooks.

25:35.066 --> 25:39.727
Homemade cake with a note.
''Sorry to you and your family. Emily.''

25:39.904 --> 25:42.904
Maybe we were a little off
on the fatal-attraction theory.

25:43.073 --> 25:45.112
No, Brandon, we're dead on it
and deep in it.

25:45.284 --> 25:48.154
- Oh, looks good.
- Brandon, don't eat that.

25:48.370 --> 25:51.619
Look, this whole thing could be dosed
with Euphoria or worse.

25:51.789 --> 25:54.742
l repeat,
you don't know who this girl is.

26:04.759 --> 26:05.790
Morning.

26:05.968 --> 26:08.423
Hey, what's that?

26:08.596 --> 26:11.845
- A folding Corona.
- God, it's beautiful.

26:12.015 --> 26:14.256
Yeah, it's a work of art.

26:14.434 --> 26:17.007
My dad gave it to me when l was 1 0.

26:17.187 --> 26:19.642
All the great old reporters
used to travel with these.

26:19.814 --> 26:21.189
This has probably seen wars,

26:21.357 --> 26:23.515
maybe even typed a novel
in Paris, who knows?

26:23.692 --> 26:26.396
You can feel the keys.
lt's got a real strength, this machine.

26:26.570 --> 26:28.396
l love it.

26:28.572 --> 26:32.236
l'm glad you like it.
l'm giving it to the paper.

26:32.867 --> 26:34.693
l can't accept this.

26:34.911 --> 26:36.239
You really care about your work.

26:36.412 --> 26:38.238
l know you'll respect it
and take care of it.

26:38.455 --> 26:39.949
So let's just call it a parting gift

26:40.124 --> 26:42.080
and thanks for your letting me
write for you.

26:42.250 --> 26:44.574
Wait a minute.
Are you going somewhere?

26:44.794 --> 26:46.252
Yeah, l'm quitting the paper.

26:47.422 --> 26:50.541
- You're joking.
- No, it's for the best.

26:50.758 --> 26:52.584
Let's face it.
l really blew it with Brandon.

26:52.760 --> 26:56.294
And for his sake,
l shouldn't be where l'm not wanted.

26:56.513 --> 26:58.635
Emily, your writing's
getting really good.

26:58.807 --> 27:02.175
And if you wanna stay,
it's okay with me.

27:02.351 --> 27:04.010
Thanks.

27:04.854 --> 27:06.431
l'll see you at the inauguration.

27:08.023 --> 27:10.644
- Where?
- You know, when we finish the float.

27:11.443 --> 27:12.771
l don't know.

27:13.361 --> 27:14.771
Hey, you helped build it.

27:15.613 --> 27:18.613
l'm really not in a big rush
to be where l'm not wanted.

27:19.200 --> 27:21.607
Look, you belong in that picture.

27:23.912 --> 27:25.109
Are you sure?

27:26.373 --> 27:27.950
Absolutely.

27:29.750 --> 27:31.658
Thanks, Andrea.

27:37.966 --> 27:39.673
He's taking you where?

27:39.843 --> 27:41.634
Out for an evening of Paganini.

27:41.803 --> 27:44.507
Oh, their pasta is supposed
to be excellent.

27:44.680 --> 27:47.087
Donna, Paganini is a composer.

27:47.266 --> 27:49.507
He wrote all this wild stuff
for the violin.

27:49.685 --> 27:51.262
And you guys like
that kind of music?

27:51.436 --> 27:52.467
Don't you know?

27:52.646 --> 27:55.136
Brenda and Dylan go to concerts
so they can make out to music.

27:55.315 --> 27:56.346
Not.

27:56.524 --> 27:59.014
Look, in addition to listening
to some very interesting music,

27:59.193 --> 28:01.399
we are also showing
that we are mature enough

28:01.570 --> 28:04.274
to restrain ourselves in public.

28:08.326 --> 28:10.401
Speaking of restraint.

28:10.578 --> 28:13.578
l would really just like to bust
that girl's chops sometimes.

28:13.789 --> 28:15.366
What is your problem with her?

28:15.541 --> 28:17.332
Yeah. l mean,
she's always nice to me.

28:17.543 --> 28:19.831
Look, l really don't wanna get into it.
Just trust me.

28:20.003 --> 28:22.493
She's doing a major obsession job
on Brandon.

28:22.714 --> 28:25.500
- l used to do that all the time.
- Kelly, not like this.

28:25.675 --> 28:28.426
ln eighth grade, l sent Ronnie
Lightstone perfumed love letters

28:28.594 --> 28:29.969
and called him ten times a day.

28:30.137 --> 28:31.678
And what happened?

28:31.847 --> 28:33.506
Well, his mother paid a visit
to my mother

28:33.682 --> 28:36.635
and l got grounded,
lost my phone privileges,

28:36.809 --> 28:38.801
and learned the gentle art
of subtlety.

28:39.020 --> 28:40.264
Yeah, well, Emily Valentine

28:40.438 --> 28:42.809
has stepped way over the line
of being subtle.

28:44.983 --> 28:47.900
Don't forget. Andrea wants us
to take a picture in front of the float

28:48.069 --> 28:49.266
- for the paper.
- l'm there.

28:49.446 --> 28:50.477
- Me three.
- Right. Bye.

28:50.655 --> 28:51.899
- See you.
- Bye.

29:00.247 --> 29:02.038
All right, you guys, hoist it up there.

29:02.207 --> 29:04.199
- Here we go, Steve.
- Right there.

29:04.417 --> 29:06.208
- There.
- All right.

29:07.587 --> 29:09.045
Check it out.

29:09.213 --> 29:10.493
Check that out.

29:12.132 --> 29:15.630
- Looks terrific, Brandon.
- Thanks.

29:18.263 --> 29:20.338
- Why'd you have to bring her?
- Come on, Brandon.

29:20.515 --> 29:23.848
She worked as hard as everybody else.
l couldn't leave her out.

29:24.059 --> 29:25.636
Guys, she's ready to go. Let's roll.

29:25.811 --> 29:27.684
All right, let's get in place
for the picture.

29:27.854 --> 29:29.645
l'm gonna start the timer.
Everyone ready?

29:31.357 --> 29:34.476
Ten, nine, eight,

29:34.986 --> 29:38.319
seven, six, five,

29:38.530 --> 29:40.189
four, three--

29:40.365 --> 29:42.024
Damn it, Emily, enough!

29:44.911 --> 29:47.864
Don't touch me. Don't call me.
Don't leave cakes on my doorstep.

29:48.080 --> 29:49.953
Don't manipulate
so you wind up in my bedroom.

29:50.166 --> 29:53.616
And don't lie to my friends about some
night of passion that never happened.

29:53.794 --> 29:55.204
- Brandon.
- No. l'm sorry.

29:55.420 --> 29:58.503
l tried to do this the nice way,
but you won't take a hint.

30:00.550 --> 30:03.918
l can't help it. l love you.

30:05.679 --> 30:09.343
- Emily, listen to me--
- No, no. You listen to me.

30:09.558 --> 30:11.764
When l first moved to L.A.,
guys were hitting on me,

30:11.935 --> 30:13.215
and l had my pick.

30:14.270 --> 30:16.476
But then l went out with you.

30:16.981 --> 30:18.973
l thought you were different.

30:19.692 --> 30:22.182
l thought you were special.
l thought what we had was special.

30:26.114 --> 30:28.865
That's why l wanted my first time
to be with you.

30:29.992 --> 30:32.529
So my first time would be something
l'd always wanna remember.

30:35.956 --> 30:38.031
You gave me something
to remember, all right.

30:40.335 --> 30:42.541
When l first moved here,
everyone thought l was a slut.

30:44.505 --> 30:46.544
Brandon, you've managed
to make me feel like one.

30:46.715 --> 30:48.623
Thanks for the memories.

30:53.555 --> 30:55.463
Brandon, let her go.

31:08.943 --> 31:11.350
Brandon Walsh sure knows
how to dump a girl.

31:11.529 --> 31:13.355
l've never seen anybody so smooth.

31:13.531 --> 31:16.068
What was l supposed to do?
She wouldn't leave me alone.

31:16.283 --> 31:19.200
- Well, maybe now she will.
- lt's not that l don't like her.

31:19.369 --> 31:22.239
lt's just the minute l tried
to cool things off, she went ballistic.

31:22.455 --> 31:25.159
- What did you say to her?
- Basically, he told her to drop dead.

31:25.374 --> 31:28.576
- Brandon.
- l did not. l just put my foot down.

31:28.794 --> 31:31.747
- lt was out of control.
- Well, l feel bad for her.

31:31.922 --> 31:33.878
l mean, at that age,
overwhelmed by emotions,

31:34.049 --> 31:35.792
you don't always act rationally.

31:36.009 --> 31:37.384
l'm sure she's ashamed of herself.

31:37.552 --> 31:41.050
And l just hope that whatever you said,
you didn't say it in front of anybody.

31:46.268 --> 31:47.465
l'll get it.

31:51.397 --> 31:52.891
Hello?

31:54.066 --> 31:55.607
Hello?

31:58.654 --> 32:00.860
Well, whatever you said
didn't cure her phone habit.

32:12.874 --> 32:14.700
That's it.
l'm calling the phone company.

32:14.876 --> 32:17.912
No, no, no, let me handle this.

32:23.551 --> 32:25.757
How you doing?
This is Sal's Pizzeria.

32:25.969 --> 32:27.297
We got them large, small, plain,

32:27.471 --> 32:31.717
and your choice of 1 4 delicious
toppings just for you.

32:31.891 --> 32:33.432
Hello?

32:34.810 --> 32:36.090
Well, l got her.

32:37.479 --> 32:41.523
Look, making fun of Emily
is not the way to deal with this.

32:41.692 --> 32:44.396
We should just call her parents.

32:46.404 --> 32:47.981
l'll get it.

32:48.447 --> 32:51.613
Come on, ring.
l'm just getting warmed up.

32:52.326 --> 32:53.820
Andrea, what are you doing here?

32:53.994 --> 32:55.950
Shouldn't you be putting
the paper to sleep?

32:56.121 --> 32:58.872
To bed, Steve. To bed.

32:59.040 --> 33:01.874
Brandon, you know those bizarre
letters we were getting at the paper?

33:02.043 --> 33:03.074
Yeah?

33:03.252 --> 33:06.003
Well, we got another one,
and it's worse than the last.

33:06.171 --> 33:09.041
- So?
- So l'm no Columbo,

33:09.216 --> 33:12.750
but all those letters
were written on Emily's typewriter.

33:12.969 --> 33:15.293
Let me look at that.

33:16.013 --> 33:21.219
West Beverly, heed my cry
Abusers of love deserve to die

33:21.435 --> 33:24.435
Smug and secure
ln their well-mannered house

33:24.646 --> 33:28.096
They won't have long
l'm as quiet as a mouse

33:28.316 --> 33:30.189
And a poet,
on top of everything else.

33:30.359 --> 33:32.932
Don't you see, she wanted me
to discover these.

33:33.112 --> 33:35.151
These letters, they're a cry for help.

33:35.364 --> 33:38.483
A cry for help
and a pretty obvious threat.

34:22.530 --> 34:25.530
l hope tonight's concert is a little
livelier than last week's.

34:25.699 --> 34:28.107
Don't worry. We will not be bored.

34:28.284 --> 34:30.525
Oh, yeah, since when did you become
such an expert?

34:30.704 --> 34:35.364
Hey, l'm just into passion,
wherever l can find it.

34:35.542 --> 34:37.166
Hey, hey.

34:37.335 --> 34:39.456
Behave yourself.

34:48.636 --> 34:50.877
l don't get it. One minute,
she's this nice, sweet girl,

34:51.054 --> 34:53.342
and the next minute,
she's writing these weird letters.

34:53.516 --> 34:57.382
l don't know, l think Emily has what is
called a borderline-type personality.

34:57.561 --> 34:58.592
Andrea, she's nuts.

34:58.770 --> 35:00.928
Something causes that, Steve.
l mean, think about it.

35:01.147 --> 35:02.771
She's moved from high school
to high school.

35:02.941 --> 35:04.767
She probably has deep-rooted
dependency needs.

35:04.984 --> 35:07.735
l mean, she's looking for something
more stable, something permanent

35:07.903 --> 35:09.313
to latch onto.

35:10.239 --> 35:14.283
- Me?
- Well, it's like l said, she's nuts.

35:15.160 --> 35:16.951
Well, her parents aren't listed.

35:17.162 --> 35:18.703
Sure you don't have
any other number?

35:18.913 --> 35:21.486
- Just the one she gave me.
- lt's probably her private line.

35:21.707 --> 35:25.324
Well, it's off the hook.
Brandon, give us her address.

35:25.502 --> 35:27.541
l wanna go there and have a talk
with her parents.

35:27.754 --> 35:30.540
- Dad, l really don't think that--
- Brandon, it's gone far enough.

35:30.715 --> 35:33.170
Parent to parent is really the best way
to deal with this.

38:39.590 --> 38:42.211
Dylan, look.

38:51.892 --> 38:54.928
- Emily, what are you doing?
- Brenda, wait.

38:55.145 --> 38:57.386
lt's covered in gasoline.

38:57.564 --> 38:59.472
Emily, come on.
Let's talk about this.

38:59.691 --> 39:01.232
Hey, this is dangerous.

39:01.400 --> 39:04.353
What is there to talk about?
l know you hate me, Brenda.

39:04.528 --> 39:06.852
You've hated me since the first day
l started school here.

39:07.072 --> 39:10.072
- Emily, l don't hate you.
- Don't lie to me, Brenda. Not now.

39:10.283 --> 39:13.034
Hey, Bren, wait a minute,
she is whacked.

39:13.202 --> 39:16.451
Dylan, she's talking to me.
l have to listen.

39:21.168 --> 39:23.705
You've never forgiven me
for going out with him.

39:23.920 --> 39:25.959
And you resent the fact
that Brandon liked me.

39:26.172 --> 39:29.255
- Emily, that's not true.
- Don't lie to me, Brenda.

39:29.467 --> 39:31.091
Do you think
l'm fooling around here?

39:31.260 --> 39:33.584
Do you think l'm interested
in your two-faced talk?

39:33.804 --> 39:35.463
You turned everyone against me

39:35.681 --> 39:39.808
after l worked so hard to become
part of your precious little group.

39:41.978 --> 39:43.721
l don't wanna be
a part of anything anymore.

39:43.938 --> 39:47.104
Emily, don't talk like that.
You are a part of our group.

39:48.400 --> 39:50.308
Are you kidding?

39:50.485 --> 39:54.102
After the way Brandon dumped me?
Humiliated me in front of everyone?

39:56.866 --> 39:59.783
Why doesn't your brother like me,
Brenda? What did l do?

40:00.703 --> 40:03.703
Emily, Brandon's a trusting person.

40:04.539 --> 40:06.116
And you betrayed his trust.

40:06.333 --> 40:09.499
lt's gonna take time to get that back.

40:10.962 --> 40:13.879
He won't. He won't ever forgive me.

40:14.089 --> 40:16.211
Yes, he will.

40:17.175 --> 40:19.712
l swear to you, he will.

40:20.845 --> 40:22.718
Look, if you want Brandon
to give you a chance,

40:22.889 --> 40:24.347
you have to give him a chance.

40:25.683 --> 40:27.805
l know my brother.

40:28.018 --> 40:30.971
Believe me, he has his faults.

40:31.855 --> 40:34.808
But probably one of
the greatest things about him

40:34.983 --> 40:37.652
is his amazing ability to forgive.

40:39.654 --> 40:41.313
And if you want him to forgive you,
Emily,

40:41.488 --> 40:43.943
you have to give him his space.

40:45.033 --> 40:47.488
And l swear to you, he will.

41:02.882 --> 41:04.376
l'm sorry, Brenda.

41:06.510 --> 41:09.712
- l'm sorry.
- lt's okay.

41:18.688 --> 41:20.016
Emily.

41:21.774 --> 41:24.062
Emily, what's going on?

41:24.610 --> 41:26.898
l'm sorry, Brandon.

41:27.487 --> 41:29.313
Sorry for everything.

41:29.531 --> 41:32.021
l'm sorry for the phone calls,

41:33.159 --> 41:35.780
for making up that story
about my tyres being slashed

41:35.953 --> 41:37.494
so l could spend the night with you.

41:40.082 --> 41:42.370
For those disgusting letters
l didn't mean.

41:45.670 --> 41:49.168
But most of all, l'm sorry
for slipping you the Euphoria.

41:52.885 --> 41:57.048
l don't expect you
to ever wanna forgive me

41:57.222 --> 41:59.593
or even talk to me again.

42:02.476 --> 42:04.384
l guess when l lost you, l went crazy.

42:06.063 --> 42:08.185
l thought l hated you.

42:09.566 --> 42:10.976
l thought l hated all of you.

42:13.736 --> 42:17.436
But the person l hate most of all
right now is myself.

42:19.742 --> 42:21.650
Emily, you need to get some help.

42:23.620 --> 42:25.363
Has anything like this
ever happened before?

42:27.749 --> 42:29.029
A year ago, we moved,

42:29.208 --> 42:31.034
and l locked myself in my room
for three days,

42:31.210 --> 42:33.581
and played loud music
and screamed.

42:36.965 --> 42:41.792
But moving to Beverly Hills
was a whole new kind of pressure.

42:44.597 --> 42:46.636
This place is tough.

42:47.808 --> 42:49.266
You all made it easier.

42:51.645 --> 42:56.436
But l gotta admit,
l do need some help.

42:59.985 --> 43:02.392
l really need some help.

43:18.335 --> 43:21.537
- Bren, you asleep?
- No.

43:27.009 --> 43:30.045
What did Emily's parents say
when you dropped her off?

43:31.430 --> 43:34.181
Well, they couldn't say enough.

43:34.682 --> 43:38.679
They wanted to talk to me,
to Mom, Dad.

43:41.230 --> 43:44.515
Her mom told me she's been seeing
a psychiatrist on and off for years.

43:47.027 --> 43:49.268
Brandon, what do you think
is wrong with her?

43:51.197 --> 43:52.821
l don't know.

43:55.701 --> 43:58.072
lt's like she's incredibly lonely.

43:58.245 --> 44:02.324
And at the same time, she can't deal
with the idea of being close to anyone.

44:05.042 --> 44:06.749
l don't know. l'm not a shrink.

44:07.837 --> 44:10.506
No, you're definitely not.

44:13.717 --> 44:15.175
She told me what happened
out there.

44:18.846 --> 44:21.134
What'd you say to get her
to come down off the float?

44:22.766 --> 44:27.142
l told her that she would always have
two friends in Beverly Hills.

44:33.901 --> 44:35.644
Good night, Bren.

44:36.529 --> 44:37.608
Good night, Brandon.
