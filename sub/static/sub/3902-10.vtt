00:27.027 --> 00:29.863
This is the second
time this week

00:29.963 --> 00:33.334
I had to pay for a sitter
'cause he was working late.

00:33.434 --> 00:35.269
With all that money you
making, you can afford it?

00:49.417 --> 00:51.485
Lord.

00:59.527 --> 01:01.595
What's up, Bubs?

01:02.963 --> 01:04.598
Hey.

01:05.666 --> 01:08.402
Well, there you go.

01:10.971 --> 01:13.574
- Man: well, what you got?
- I got some starters.

01:32.360 --> 01:36.364
( theme music playing )

01:38.466 --> 01:40.634
* If you walk
through the garden *

01:42.370 --> 01:44.738
* You better
watch your back *

01:46.140 --> 01:49.643
* Well, I beg
your pardon *

01:49.743 --> 01:52.280
* Walk the straight
and narrow track *

01:54.315 --> 01:57.151
* If you walk
through Jesus *

01:57.251 --> 02:01.555
* He'll save your soul

02:01.655 --> 02:02.823
* You gotta
keep the devil *

02:05.459 --> 02:08.795
* Down in the hole

02:08.895 --> 02:12.400
* All the angels sing

02:12.500 --> 02:16.504
* About Jesus' mighty soul

02:16.604 --> 02:18.239
* And they shoot you
with your wing *

02:20.408 --> 02:24.011
* Keep you close
to the Lord *

02:24.111 --> 02:27.615
* Don't pay heed
to temptation *

02:27.715 --> 02:31.619
* Oh, your hands
are so cold *

02:31.719 --> 02:35.389
* You got to
keep the devil *

02:35.489 --> 02:38.859
* Way down in the hole

02:47.100 --> 02:49.670
* Way down in the hole

02:50.938 --> 02:52.873
* Way down in the hole

02:54.842 --> 02:58.246
* Way down in the hole

02:58.346 --> 03:01.415
* Way down in the hole.

03:07.888 --> 03:09.423
My fault, A.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.559
I should've never
left you alone, homie.

03:11.659 --> 03:12.826
Naw, shit.

03:12.926 --> 03:15.363
Man, you ain't pull up
when you did, I'm gone.

03:15.463 --> 03:17.931
Listen, what I want
to know is how the fuck

03:18.031 --> 03:19.933
we come back
on this cocksucker?

03:20.033 --> 03:21.469
We don't.
Not now.

03:21.569 --> 03:22.903
You feel me?
Listen, your advice,

03:24.505 --> 03:26.039
Stringer, your advice
was good advice.

03:26.139 --> 03:28.276
I want to
let you know that.

03:28.376 --> 03:30.077
What I want you
to do now,

03:30.177 --> 03:32.145
I want you to put
the word out there.
I want you to let him know

03:32.246 --> 03:33.381
we willin' to squash this,
if he is.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.450
And then what the fuck
if he ain't?

03:36.550 --> 03:38.452
Naw, this nigga
lives in the town too,

03:38.552 --> 03:39.687
he gonna listen,
if we parlay.

03:41.021 --> 03:43.757
And then when he creep out
of his hole and shit.

03:43.857 --> 03:45.025
- Boom.
- Okay.

03:45.125 --> 03:47.261
- Smoke him.
- Say no more, got you.

03:47.361 --> 03:49.463
- Put that out there, yo.
- A'ight.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.301
What about them
police, though?

03:53.401 --> 03:55.168
They was on your ass
after the game?

03:55.269 --> 03:57.538
Yeah, man,
it was like two cars.

03:57.638 --> 04:01.809
See, if they on you,
then they got a name.

04:01.909 --> 04:04.745
If they got a name,
then they know you
ain't got no license.

04:04.845 --> 04:06.980
Yeah, but they don't want
no traffic charges,

04:07.080 --> 04:08.816
you know what I'm sayin'?
They don't want no humble shit.

04:08.916 --> 04:11.184
I think they was tryin'
to see where I might go.

04:11.285 --> 04:13.587
Where the fuck was you
gonna take their asses?

04:13.687 --> 04:15.389
I was takin' them
to the barbershop.

04:15.489 --> 04:17.291
For real, I was goin'
to get a haircut.

04:17.891 --> 04:19.192
Get a fade?

04:19.293 --> 04:20.827
I know, B, but...

04:20.928 --> 04:23.263
these motherfuckers are on us.
What the fuck?

04:23.364 --> 04:27.601
They always been on us,
we just got to be careful.

04:27.701 --> 04:30.137
Well, you not been
talkin' on any phones.

04:30.237 --> 04:32.272
And you not been
touching any drugs.

04:32.373 --> 04:35.208
And from now on,
you are not doin'
the money runs.

04:35.309 --> 04:37.144
Me and Bey, we gonna
take care of that shit

04:37.244 --> 04:38.812
until this
whole thing cool off.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.814
Let me
get that pager.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.883
Oh, what's up,
you serious?

04:42.983 --> 04:45.185
Serious, I'm gonna get you
a New York supply number only.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.755
Any of these motherfucking
local cats want to talk to you,

04:48.522 --> 04:49.990
they gotta talk to me.

04:54.227 --> 04:57.498
We gotta build
a wall around you, B.

05:01.201 --> 05:02.803
Another month
on a fresh phone?

05:02.903 --> 05:05.172
Yeah, they ripped out
the pay phones in
the low-rises.

05:05.272 --> 05:06.474
Now they're walking
a block or two away.

05:06.574 --> 05:07.608
I'm just asking,
how much longer

05:07.708 --> 05:08.909
until you bring
this case in, Jimmy?

05:09.009 --> 05:10.411
The quicker you can,
the better for everybody.

05:10.511 --> 05:11.945
Yourself included.

05:12.045 --> 05:14.882
Look at this,
Judge Gwynn sends
his regrets.

05:14.982 --> 05:17.785
He can't make lunch.
Like I got the plague
all of a sudden.

05:17.885 --> 05:19.653
There's your new phone,
30 days.

05:19.753 --> 05:22.390
A couple of weeks ago,
when Burrell wanted
to take down the wire,

05:22.490 --> 05:23.657
you were the one
breaking it off in his ass.

05:23.757 --> 05:25.626
Jimmy, Jimmy,
there's a lady here.

05:25.726 --> 05:28.161
Rhonda talks more trash
than both of us, Your Honor.

05:28.261 --> 05:30.664
I have never been anything other
than lady-like, Your Honor.

05:32.032 --> 05:34.301
Detective McNulty
is going out of his way

05:34.402 --> 05:36.203
to insult an officer
of the court.

05:36.303 --> 05:37.871
McNulty,
I hold you in contempt.

05:37.971 --> 05:39.840
Who doesn't?

05:41.208 --> 05:42.410
What's with him?

05:42.510 --> 05:44.645
- You haven't heard?
- No.

05:49.316 --> 05:50.818
What's wrong
with the picture?

05:50.918 --> 05:54.087
- Don't know.
- Phelan isn't in it.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.723
What, he's up
for election?

05:55.823 --> 05:58.058
I thought judges
had 15-year terms.

05:58.158 --> 06:00.394
They do, but Phelan was named
to finish Halpern's term,

06:01.294 --> 06:02.563
which only had
two years left.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.364
So he has to run
on his own in the primary.

06:04.465 --> 06:05.966
What, he's not
on the ticket?

06:06.066 --> 06:07.300
Why the fuck not?

06:07.401 --> 06:10.337
Maybe it's
the company he keeps?

06:10.438 --> 06:12.372
Oh, fuck.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.307
No, see, you ain't
thinkin' about

06:14.408 --> 06:15.876
how much room
the baby gonna need.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.511
Especially when
he get to growin',

06:18.912 --> 06:21.181
'cause, I mean, there are
things we got to have.

06:21.281 --> 06:24.051
Like a real crib,
a play desk,

06:24.151 --> 06:26.754
and you know, he got to have
one of them little tyke cars.

06:26.854 --> 06:29.389
I'm not sayin' your place
ain't nice enough.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.659
'cause for you,
it do just fine,

06:31.759 --> 06:33.594
but if we gonna
be a family,

06:33.694 --> 06:35.062
we need at least
one more room,

06:35.896 --> 06:37.397
if not two.

06:37.498 --> 06:38.966
So you add
the bedroom set,

06:39.066 --> 06:41.401
a nice bedroom set
like the one they got

06:41.502 --> 06:43.336
down at that baby store
on Howard Street,

06:43.437 --> 06:45.072
and that's a room
right there.

06:45.172 --> 06:47.908
And I think we might could
get some better furniture

06:48.008 --> 06:50.410
and put your stuff
in the other bedroom,

06:50.511 --> 06:52.379
like it was a den,

06:52.480 --> 06:54.782
'cause the sofa you got
seen better days.

06:54.882 --> 06:56.650
I think you
know that much.

07:00.053 --> 07:02.122
Dee, where you goin' at?

07:02.222 --> 07:05.292
I told you I need money
for the new bedroom set!

07:05.392 --> 07:06.627
- ( door closes )
- Dee!

07:06.727 --> 07:08.095
Man:
Why you holler at me?

07:08.195 --> 07:09.830
Man 2:
Yo, man, we gettin'
down to it.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.699
I get to you
when I get to you.

07:11.799 --> 07:13.100
That's the main
stash house.

07:14.167 --> 07:15.703
Say what?

07:15.803 --> 07:18.271
The incoming call is the guy
who runs the main stash

07:18.371 --> 07:19.573
- for Barksdale's people.
- Who is he?

07:19.673 --> 07:21.174
McNulty
We don't know.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.110
So, you all just guessing
he's on the stash, right?

07:23.210 --> 07:24.612
No, he's on it.

07:24.712 --> 07:27.548
Lester was checking the logs
a couple of weeks ago

07:27.648 --> 07:28.916
when he picked up
the pattern.

07:29.016 --> 07:30.984
Every time they get down
to the ends on a package,

07:31.084 --> 07:32.953
somebody in the tower
hits that pager number.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.422
And then, within a half hour
every fucking time,

07:35.523 --> 07:36.857
a call comes back
to the tower pay phone

07:37.725 --> 07:39.192
from that number
in Pimlico.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.494
Which is?

07:40.594 --> 07:41.762
It's a pay phone
at a Mondo Mart

07:41.862 --> 07:43.631
in Reisterstown
at Cold Spring Lane.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.634
You see it now?

07:46.734 --> 07:48.235
Hmm?

07:50.938 --> 07:55.208
When the supply gets low,
they page this mope,

07:55.308 --> 07:58.245
who always calls back
from a pay phone

07:58.345 --> 07:59.680
way the fuck out
in northwest.

08:00.514 --> 08:01.615
Same phone,
same pattern.

08:03.283 --> 08:05.185
So, y'all think that
he's taking the re-up order

08:05.285 --> 08:08.155
and that the stash is somewhere
near the Mondo Mart, right?

08:08.255 --> 08:09.590
You are on it,
Detective Sydnor.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.159
Okay, so what do
you do with this?

08:12.259 --> 08:14.094
What do we do?

08:15.929 --> 08:18.031
We're gonna be sittin'
on that pay phone in Pimlico

08:18.131 --> 08:20.133
all day and all night,
waitin' on Mr. Mondo Mart.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.602
Herc, too.

08:21.702 --> 08:23.604
Herc's out this whole week.
In-service training.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.405
That's too bad.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.908
So, instead of three
eight-hour shifts,

08:28.008 --> 08:30.410
you two are gonna
have to pull 12 hours.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.380
Just fucking
kill me now.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.414
( chuckling )

08:35.515 --> 08:36.884
Heard from Omar?

08:36.984 --> 08:38.686
Nope.

08:38.785 --> 08:40.988
I'm gonna go try
to scare him up.
Where you gonna be?

08:41.087 --> 08:43.222
Well, everyone on the wire
keeps talking about

08:43.323 --> 08:45.793
how this kid's all tore up
about the dead stickup boy.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.995
- I'm gonna see for myself.
- All right.

08:48.095 --> 08:49.663
You need us,
we're on the radio.

08:50.397 --> 08:51.364
Okay.

08:51.464 --> 08:54.034
( car radio playing )

09:25.132 --> 09:26.900
Hey, what up, man?

09:30.537 --> 09:33.440
This first time,
I can go four ounces of rock.

09:33.540 --> 09:34.842
But hey,
if the shit is right,

09:34.942 --> 09:37.010
then next time
I can step that up.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.646
Almost ain't
worth it for four.

09:39.479 --> 09:40.681
Just this
first go-round.

09:42.215 --> 09:43.450
You do right by me,

09:43.550 --> 09:45.252
I'll turn around
and come back on it.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.054
Where your
money at, man?

09:56.363 --> 09:58.265
We good.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.102
So, where the shit at?

10:14.081 --> 10:16.283
( laughing )

10:21.188 --> 10:23.623
( dog barking )

10:47.881 --> 10:49.750
Woman:
Ain't nobody been there
but you.

10:51.018 --> 10:53.320
Nobody came in my house
but you.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.322
- Man: Everybody been.
- Nobody but you.

10:55.422 --> 10:58.959
You're the only person
that came in my house.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.094
So, what you got
goin' for you?

11:01.194 --> 11:05.265
Ain't got nothin' left,
burnt it away.

11:05.365 --> 11:07.000
Family?

11:07.100 --> 11:10.137
Mother dead.
Father, who the fuck know?

11:10.237 --> 11:12.172
Brothers, sisters?

11:12.272 --> 11:14.474
A sister.

11:14.574 --> 11:16.076
She lets me
stay in the basement,

11:16.176 --> 11:18.812
but she lock the door
so I can't go upstairs.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.113
About the best
she can do for me.

11:20.948 --> 11:23.717
I got a kid,
a son.

11:23.817 --> 11:25.485
Imagine me bringing life
into the world.

11:25.585 --> 11:27.187
What's his name?

11:27.287 --> 11:28.688
Keyshawn.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.958
His mother took him up
Jersey way,

11:31.058 --> 11:32.793
said I wasn't fit
to be with the boy.

11:32.893 --> 11:34.694
I ain't disagree.

11:34.795 --> 11:36.363
Well, at least
you got your health.

11:38.298 --> 11:39.733
Ha ha.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.735
Here's to health.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.439
I got the bug.

11:46.539 --> 11:49.509
Had it since '94.

11:49.609 --> 11:53.180
Gave that shit
to my ol' lady.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.382
Worried about passing it on
to my baby girl.

11:56.917 --> 11:59.719
Naw, I was spared
that at least.

12:00.821 --> 12:03.456
Damn, how you carry it?

12:05.125 --> 12:06.459
You ask her
forgiveness?

12:06.559 --> 12:08.128
'Course.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.462
What she say?

12:09.562 --> 12:11.932
What she needed to say.

12:12.032 --> 12:15.168
Look, forgiveness
from other folks is good,

12:15.268 --> 12:18.471
but ain't nothin' but words
comin' at you from outside.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.473
You want
to kick this shit,

12:20.573 --> 12:22.509
you got to forgive
your own self.

12:27.114 --> 12:28.415
Love yourself some,
brother.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.853
And then drag your sorry ass
to some meetings.

12:32.953 --> 12:35.688
- Meetings?
- What the fuck
do you wanna hear?

12:35.789 --> 12:38.125
That you strong enough
to do this by yourself?

12:38.225 --> 12:39.526
Gettin' clean's
the easy part.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.463
Now comes life.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.768
McNulty:
It's this one here
with the orange cord

12:48.869 --> 12:51.571
coming out of the back.
They're pirating juice
from the other house.

12:51.671 --> 12:54.774
You fucking
gotta be kidding me.
Now I'm policing for BG&E?

12:54.875 --> 12:56.810
They're not
there yet.

12:56.910 --> 12:58.211
But when this kid
here posts,

12:58.311 --> 12:59.779
snatch him up.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.748
Park our asses
outside this shit hole

13:01.849 --> 13:03.716
and wait for some little
project yo to raise up?

13:03.817 --> 13:06.019
Mrs. McNulty
raised no fools.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.488
Four Faidley's crabcakes
in the bag,

13:08.588 --> 13:10.858
24 Dutch beers
in the box.

13:10.958 --> 13:13.626
- Faidley's, huh?
- You're alright, McNulty.

13:13.726 --> 13:16.363
I don't care
what all them other fucks
downtown say about you.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.833
11-35,
what's up?

13:19.933 --> 13:22.502
Greggs:
Our friend wants a meet.
Same spot.

13:22.602 --> 13:24.171
Copy that, 15 minutes.

13:24.271 --> 13:25.538
What's the deal
with the yo boy?

13:26.406 --> 13:27.507
What he do?

13:27.607 --> 13:29.776
He stumbled
into my world.

13:29.877 --> 13:33.213
* If you leave,
I'll go crazy *

13:33.313 --> 13:37.517
* If you forget me,
I'll go crazy *

13:37.617 --> 13:40.553
* 'Cause I love you

13:46.359 --> 13:49.096
* You gotta live
for yourself *

13:49.196 --> 13:51.131
* For yourself
and nobody else *

13:51.231 --> 13:55.768
* You gotta live for yourself,
for yourself and nobody else *

13:55.869 --> 13:58.906
* If you leave,
I'll go crazy... *

13:59.006 --> 14:01.074
Five minutes, c'mon.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.475
- I have to go.
- Shardene.

14:02.575 --> 14:04.044
I said,
I have to go.

14:04.144 --> 14:06.513
- I can't have five minutes?!
- No, not right now.

14:09.782 --> 14:12.052
Fuck!

14:13.386 --> 14:15.989
* You gotta live
for yourself *

14:16.089 --> 14:17.024
* For yourself
and nobody else... *

14:17.124 --> 14:19.192
How close
did you get?

14:19.292 --> 14:20.961
Y'all be chalkin'
that nigga

14:21.061 --> 14:23.230
if Wee-Bey ain't pop up
at the last second like.

14:23.330 --> 14:25.132
Remember when
we last talked?

14:25.232 --> 14:27.867
You were gonna lay back,
let us work our case.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.736
I said I'd do
what I can.

14:29.836 --> 14:32.139
Still, I thought
I might let y'all know

14:32.239 --> 14:33.873
Avon's people
got in contact,

14:33.974 --> 14:35.308
talkin' about they want
to end the beef.

14:35.408 --> 14:38.545
They offered me
some kind of amnesty.

14:38.645 --> 14:39.746
Amnesty?

14:39.846 --> 14:41.915
Look, I chill out
on the manhunt

14:42.015 --> 14:44.985
and stop hittin' them
in the head for they product.

14:45.085 --> 14:46.519
They gonna
call off the bounty.

14:46.619 --> 14:48.155
Take the truce, Omar.

14:48.255 --> 14:52.092
I might, if they ain't
tryin' to play me.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.094
They said they want
to parley on it.

14:54.194 --> 14:55.562
- Parley?
- Look, I don't know, man,

14:57.130 --> 14:59.299
but right now I need
some assistance from y'all.

15:10.410 --> 15:14.314
Yo, son, I go to the ER
and word get back to Avon,

15:14.414 --> 15:15.882
you know he gonna
have his henchmen

15:15.983 --> 15:17.985
waitin' in
the parking lot for me.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.524
Look, I know y'all friendly
with a couple of doctors, right?

15:24.624 --> 15:26.259
Right?

15:45.645 --> 15:47.047
He says
he can buy weight.

15:47.147 --> 15:49.382
Says he runs with
some decent-size locals.

15:49.482 --> 15:50.750
Like who?

15:50.850 --> 15:52.719
Avon something...

15:52.819 --> 15:54.354
Barksdale.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.089
Avon Barksdale.

15:56.189 --> 15:57.557
Run it through
the Dex and HIDTA,

15:58.225 --> 16:00.160
see what comes back.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.232
All right,
I'm gonna check around,

16:05.332 --> 16:07.500
see if anybody's working
these names you're giving us.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.237
And if you full of shit, pal,
I'm gonna know it quick.

16:10.337 --> 16:12.305
But, what happens to me
while you checkin'?

16:12.405 --> 16:13.806
Eager Street.

16:13.906 --> 16:16.076
City jail,
motherfucker.

16:18.278 --> 16:20.147
Philip came home
last week.

16:20.247 --> 16:22.515
I ain't seen him
since Afram. Uh-huh.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.984
Yep.

16:26.253 --> 16:28.355
I can't believe it.

16:38.565 --> 16:40.500
( belches )

16:48.875 --> 16:51.078
Damn, Carv,
you's triflin'.

16:51.178 --> 16:52.579
Yeah, I admit it,
I'm disgusting.

16:52.679 --> 16:55.815
Cheese Puffs
and fuckin' Ring-Dings?

16:55.915 --> 16:57.417
Yeah.

17:20.940 --> 17:23.542
( phone ringing )

17:24.544 --> 17:25.811
Yeah.

17:25.912 --> 17:28.315
The big fuck
from the high-rise,
what's his name?

17:28.415 --> 17:31.518
- Little Man.
- Yeah, him.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.386
All right.

17:39.592 --> 17:42.329
( phone ringing )

17:42.429 --> 17:43.330
Yo.

17:43.430 --> 17:45.265
Be ready,
we're on it.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.406
Look at this
pretty motherfucker.

18:01.981 --> 18:04.317
Too fucked up
to drive home, McNulty?

18:14.627 --> 18:16.463
Hey, Bunk.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.670
Kid gave us
a murder.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.838
More than that,
he's put in Stringer Bell.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.507
Oh, yeah?

18:27.607 --> 18:30.777
Picks out Wee-Bey, Bird
and Stinkum from photo arrays.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.078
Puts them all up
at the Greek's

18:32.179 --> 18:33.980
the night they grab up
Omar's boy Brandon.

18:34.080 --> 18:36.349
Puts Bell
in the truck, too.

18:36.449 --> 18:39.219
Says Stringer told him
to point out the stickup boy.

18:40.287 --> 18:41.888
Geez, what do you
have over him?

18:41.988 --> 18:43.356
Not a fucking thing.

18:43.456 --> 18:46.025
Kid was ready,
barely had to push him.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.760
Whose case?

18:47.860 --> 18:49.729
Norris's.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.898
How old?

18:51.998 --> 18:53.366
16.

18:53.466 --> 18:56.135
Lives in a shit-hole vacant
over on Argyle.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.805
When I grab him up,
I swear he's halfway
into a nod.

18:58.905 --> 19:01.508
- Using?
- Hmm.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.743
When they killed
the stickup boy,

19:03.843 --> 19:06.246
the motherfuckers dumped
the body in the alley
right behind where this kid

19:06.346 --> 19:08.515
and all the other
low-rise hoppers
lay their heads.

19:08.615 --> 19:10.317
Can you imagine?

19:10.417 --> 19:13.320
All he can think about.

19:13.420 --> 19:16.022
You tell him he's gonna
have to testify?

19:16.122 --> 19:17.624
Not yet,
we'll get there.

19:17.724 --> 19:20.427
Problem is, what do
I do with him now?

19:28.034 --> 19:29.936
( camera clicking )

19:34.374 --> 19:36.743
( phone ringing )

19:36.843 --> 19:37.777
Yep.

19:37.877 --> 19:40.413
Big boy picking up.

19:40.513 --> 19:41.848
Okay.

19:43.983 --> 19:45.352
You holler at me, right?

19:45.452 --> 19:47.354
Where you at, man,
we all the way down.

19:47.454 --> 19:49.589
First thing tomorrow, man.

19:52.459 --> 19:55.262
- ( phone ringing )
- Yeah?

19:55.362 --> 19:57.597
- It's him, stay on it.
- All right.

20:22.188 --> 20:24.591
I didn't do nothing, man.
Get me outta here.

20:28.828 --> 20:31.398
Man on radio:
The two-two grounded
slowly towards third

20:31.498 --> 20:35.402
and gets foul
at the last moment.

20:35.502 --> 20:39.406
Suzuki's at the plate,
here's the pitch.

20:39.506 --> 20:44.311
Line drive, up the middle,
a base hit for Suzuki.

20:46.145 --> 20:48.415
Suzuki's very patient
at the plate.

20:48.515 --> 20:52.419
Yeah, man, it's me.
Guess who's up in here.

20:52.519 --> 20:56.589
Pimpin' ass Orlando,
from the club.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.157
Yeah.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.393
Courtside.

21:16.242 --> 21:18.311
( beeping )

21:27.286 --> 21:29.255
Daniels:
So how long
you been slingin'?

21:29.356 --> 21:31.858
Since I was,
maybe, 12.

21:31.958 --> 21:35.094
And how long were you
with Barksdale's crew
in the low-rises?

21:35.194 --> 21:39.031
With D'Angelo?
Not long.

21:39.131 --> 21:42.134
He came down from the towers
at the beginning of the summer.

21:42.234 --> 21:43.503
Before that I worked
for Ronnie Mo.

21:44.504 --> 21:46.105
D'Angelo ever talk
to you about

21:46.205 --> 21:47.374
what happened in
the 221 building?

21:47.474 --> 21:50.610
With Pooh getting shot?

21:50.710 --> 21:52.278
How about anything else
like that?

21:52.379 --> 21:54.080
Like what?

21:54.180 --> 21:55.948
Killings, murders.

21:57.384 --> 21:59.452
He say anything about
a girl getting shot

21:59.552 --> 22:00.987
in an apartment up
on the eastside?

22:01.688 --> 22:03.823
He--

22:06.258 --> 22:08.895
naw, Dee,
he was good to me.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.830
He all right.

22:10.930 --> 22:14.401
But D'Angelo, he was
who you called that night

22:14.501 --> 22:16.235
when you saw the stickup boy
at the Greek's, right?

22:16.335 --> 22:18.237
Yeah, but he didn't
go up there.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.639
It was mostly
those tower boys.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.241
And Stringer.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.776
You said Stringer
was in the truck.

22:23.876 --> 22:24.877
He called you over,

22:24.977 --> 22:26.946
asked you to point out
the stickup boy.

22:34.320 --> 22:36.055
All of it corroborated
by the beeper logs

22:36.155 --> 22:38.224
and the pen registers
from the project pay phones.

22:38.324 --> 22:41.260
Stinkum's dead.
We've already got Bird
for the Gant killing.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.295
- This ties them all in.
- D'Angelo, too.

22:43.396 --> 22:46.065
Maybe, but since he didn't
show at the Greeks,

22:46.165 --> 22:49.201
he takes the stand
and tells the jury he didn't
see the murder coming.

22:49.301 --> 22:50.670
Well, it's enough
to charge him, anyway.

22:50.770 --> 22:52.304
- Parents?
- Alcoholic mother.

22:52.405 --> 22:53.940
In the wind,
no fixed address.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.042
Says he's got a grandmother
down on the eastern shore,

22:56.142 --> 22:58.411
- but he hasn't
seen her in years.
- How about a hotel room?

22:58.511 --> 23:00.179
On whose dime?

23:00.279 --> 23:03.382
No way the deputy
approves the manpower
to stash a 16-year-old,

23:03.483 --> 23:05.051
much less
the room service.

23:05.151 --> 23:07.019
McNulty, line two.

23:14.761 --> 23:16.763
How about you run this
up to front office?

23:16.863 --> 23:18.631
See if the state's attorney
will kick in.

23:19.499 --> 23:21.801
He's a kid, Cedric.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.269
Even if
we clear the money,

23:23.369 --> 23:24.771
do you really want
to put a juvenile

23:24.871 --> 23:27.206
in a hotel for six months
waiting on a trial date?

23:27.306 --> 23:31.177
I think you all need
to get with grandma
down on the shore.

23:33.713 --> 23:35.748
Now?
She's doing this
right now?

23:35.848 --> 23:39.418
They don't have to
set a hearing date
or something like that?

23:43.255 --> 23:45.257
Christ, yeah, okay.

23:45.357 --> 23:47.126
Yeah.

23:49.529 --> 23:51.664
I fucking need
a fucking lawyer.

23:55.735 --> 23:57.236
What?

23:57.336 --> 24:01.007
Still, you can see that
they got the security bars.

24:01.107 --> 24:02.108
And look there.
Cameras...

24:04.811 --> 24:06.579
that see over the yard
out to the street.

24:07.446 --> 24:08.881
And I checked
with Verizon,

24:08.981 --> 24:10.650
there's no phone service
at that address.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.585
Well, that's a telltale
right there.

24:12.685 --> 24:15.021
So what?
We try to write a warrant
for this place, right?

24:15.522 --> 24:16.656
Right?

24:27.133 --> 24:28.434
What are you seeing?

24:28.535 --> 24:30.436
No pattern, really.

24:30.537 --> 24:32.438
Except this cluster
of old storefronts

24:32.539 --> 24:34.774
and warehouses on
the westside of downtown.

24:34.874 --> 24:38.210
Around Paca, Eutaw,
Howard Street, mostly.

24:38.310 --> 24:41.213
- Storefronts?
- Vacants, usually.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.949
Three different
holding companies.

24:43.049 --> 24:45.952
Detective Prezbylewski.

24:46.052 --> 24:47.419
What?

24:47.520 --> 24:50.256
You have a gift
for the paper trail.

24:52.825 --> 24:56.128
Tomorrow calls for
some street work, though.
Are you street ready?

24:57.564 --> 25:01.400
Um, you know the lieutenant
has me in-office.

25:01.500 --> 25:02.969
I don't have my gun
until the grand jury.

25:03.069 --> 25:05.404
- You won't need one.
- On the street?

25:05.504 --> 25:07.273
- No gun?
- No gun.

25:07.373 --> 25:09.275
Not for this.

25:10.977 --> 25:13.045
Furthermore, Mr. McNulty,
having utilized his sons

25:14.714 --> 25:18.050
in an act of police work,
involving a criminal suspect,

25:18.150 --> 25:21.954
actually lost track of them
in a crowded municipal market.

25:22.054 --> 25:24.724
This is simply unacceptable,
Your Honor.

25:24.824 --> 25:27.694
Be that as it may,
an emergency ex parte order

25:27.794 --> 25:29.796
is an extraordinary
request, Mr. Palmer.

25:29.896 --> 25:31.964
You actually want me
to limit visitations

25:32.064 --> 25:34.133
to afternoons only
and you want

25:34.233 --> 25:36.869
Mrs. McNulty present
at all visitations?
Come on.

25:36.969 --> 25:39.672
Palmer: It is not
a single lapse, Judge.

25:39.772 --> 25:41.874
Mr. McNulty
has time and again

25:41.974 --> 25:43.876
failed to properly care
for the children

25:43.976 --> 25:45.645
when they're
in his custody.

25:45.745 --> 25:48.047
I have a list of recent
events, Your Honor,

25:48.147 --> 25:49.916
that justify an order.

25:50.016 --> 25:53.119
Ms. Pearlman
do you have a response
you'd like to offer up here?

25:54.553 --> 25:56.455
Nope.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.057
Nothing?

26:00.392 --> 26:02.361
If this were
possession with intent,

26:02.461 --> 26:03.896
I'd be a prosecutor
with a plan.

26:03.996 --> 26:05.231
But a domestic
order hearing?

26:06.933 --> 26:08.868
Your Honor,
I'm officially clueless.

26:08.968 --> 26:10.703
In fact, as an employee
of the state,

26:10.803 --> 26:12.639
I should not
actually be here.

26:12.739 --> 26:15.241
All right,
listen up, people.

26:15.341 --> 26:18.878
Before you have
me make a ruling
on an emergency petition,

26:18.978 --> 26:21.447
everybody here just needs
to take a deep breath, huh?

26:21.547 --> 26:23.249
Literally, come on.
( breathing deeply )

26:24.550 --> 26:27.153
Now, then,
is Mr. McNulty capable

26:27.253 --> 26:29.255
of having a civil conversation
with Mrs. McNulty?

26:30.056 --> 26:31.457
Yes, Your Honor.

26:31.557 --> 26:33.092
And is Mrs. McNulty
equally capable

26:33.192 --> 26:35.261
of having a conversation
with Mr. McNulty?

26:36.028 --> 26:37.329
Yes.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.198
Good, then
I'm going to lunch.

26:39.298 --> 26:41.734
And let's see when I return
if we can't busy this court

26:41.834 --> 26:43.469
with something just
a little more engaging

26:43.569 --> 26:45.004
than the problems
of the McNultys.

26:46.305 --> 26:48.040
Look, the charge
is on me.

26:48.140 --> 26:49.508
I understand that,
I'll carry that.

26:49.608 --> 26:50.910
But the least
our people can do

26:51.010 --> 26:53.479
is throw down a little
something to pay the bondsman.

26:53.579 --> 26:55.281
That's the deed
of transfer for the club.

26:55.381 --> 26:58.284
And the other thing
is a license transfer
application

26:58.384 --> 27:02.054
for the liquor board.
They're both backdated
and notarized for last week.

27:02.154 --> 27:04.223
What?

27:04.323 --> 27:07.059
A front
has to be clean.

27:07.159 --> 27:08.661
And right now,
you ain't that.

27:10.196 --> 27:11.664
Sign.

27:14.366 --> 27:15.935
I want my bail paid.

27:16.035 --> 27:17.670
You send me a bondsman,
I'll sign.

27:19.005 --> 27:21.440
Is that what you
want me to tell him?

27:21.540 --> 27:23.309
That I asked you to sign
and you wouldn't?

27:24.343 --> 27:26.412
Hmm?

27:40.226 --> 27:42.695
You wanted to be
in the game, right?

27:44.296 --> 27:45.965
Now you're
in the game.

27:47.934 --> 27:50.236
Unbelievable,
you show up with her ?

27:50.336 --> 27:52.872
Elena, you went for
an emergency ex parte.

27:52.972 --> 27:54.473
I grabbed whatever lawyer
was standing around.

27:54.573 --> 27:56.208
Oh, she was standing?

27:56.308 --> 27:59.211
Hey, ask her if she wants
the pictures back.

27:59.311 --> 28:01.380
Let's see, I've got her
at the restaurant

28:01.480 --> 28:02.982
with you
pulling out her chair.

28:03.082 --> 28:05.017
I've got her at
the motel parking lot

28:05.117 --> 28:06.819
with you opening
the car door for her

28:06.919 --> 28:08.687
because you're such
a fucking gentleman now.

28:08.788 --> 28:10.222
Yeah, well, I can't
believe you hired Buckman.

28:10.322 --> 28:12.992
Son of a bitch never made
a case that counted.

28:13.092 --> 28:15.194
Yeah, well he caught
your cheating ass.

28:18.798 --> 28:20.566
Elena,
why are we here?

28:20.666 --> 28:22.234
Because you can't--

28:22.334 --> 28:25.171
you can't have
Sean and Michael
around criminals.

28:25.271 --> 28:27.807
You can't lose them
in a Baltimore market.

28:27.907 --> 28:29.942
- That's why.
- It wasn't a criminal.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.445
I know the guy.

28:33.545 --> 28:35.247
It was a game
we were playing.

28:35.347 --> 28:37.249
It was daylight
on a crowded street.

28:37.349 --> 28:39.151
They could've been
following Al Capone.

28:39.251 --> 28:40.252
It would've been fine.

28:40.352 --> 28:42.989
Look, Elena,
these are my sons.
I love them.

28:43.089 --> 28:45.024
Do you hear?
I love them.

28:45.124 --> 28:46.458
I'm not gonna
let them get hurt.

28:50.429 --> 28:52.498
I love you, too.

28:54.300 --> 28:56.168
I still do.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.476
Does she know
about the detective
and the pictures?

29:06.178 --> 29:09.081
No, why would
I tell her about that?

29:09.181 --> 29:10.482
And are the two
of you still...

29:12.218 --> 29:13.485
No.

29:18.557 --> 29:20.459
Yes.

29:20.559 --> 29:23.062
A little.

29:32.371 --> 29:35.474
Come on, let's make nice
for the judge.

29:37.476 --> 29:39.145
Okay.

29:44.383 --> 29:46.485
Man on TV :
We know we have
a month more to go

29:46.585 --> 29:48.587
and we're not
gonna let up.

29:48.687 --> 29:52.091
We are going to raise more,
we are going to spend more,

29:52.191 --> 29:54.994
and on election day,
we are going to be out there,

29:55.094 --> 29:56.528
pushing the vote
in every precinct.

29:57.596 --> 29:59.398
You ready?

30:05.004 --> 30:06.472
Come on, we'll get
dinner first.

30:07.406 --> 30:09.541
Ain't so hungry.

30:11.777 --> 30:13.345
Come on.

30:24.523 --> 30:26.558
How much
were you using?

30:30.196 --> 30:32.865
I'm asking if you're
gonna be sick in my car.

30:32.965 --> 30:35.968
A cap now and then.

30:36.068 --> 30:38.204
You just snorting?

30:42.641 --> 30:44.376
You'll be all right
in a day or two.

30:44.476 --> 30:46.278
Come on.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.356
Yo, this nigga comin'
or what, man?

30:57.456 --> 30:59.691
Said he would,
if I guaranteed a parley.

30:59.791 --> 31:01.627
And I'm here on it.

31:01.727 --> 31:04.596
'Course, he said y'all
would be paying my fee,
rather than his ownself.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.065
Your fee?

31:06.165 --> 31:08.067
I'm doin' like one of them
marriage counselors.

31:08.167 --> 31:10.169
Charge by the hour
to tell some fool

31:10.269 --> 31:11.837
he need to bring
some flowers home.

31:11.938 --> 31:13.973
Then charge another hour
tellin' the bitch

31:14.073 --> 31:16.108
she ought to suck some cock
every little once and a while.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.644
You know, keep a marriage
strong like that.

31:19.878 --> 31:22.414
Speakin'
of cocksuckers.

31:25.017 --> 31:26.518
Don't believe we met.

31:26.618 --> 31:28.254
Proposition Joe.

31:30.156 --> 31:32.324
You ever steal from me,
I kill your whole family.

31:32.424 --> 31:35.928
All right. Y'all both here
on my guarantee,

31:36.028 --> 31:38.965
so respect that shit
and say what you feel.

31:39.065 --> 31:41.133
I'm up outta here.

31:46.438 --> 31:49.541
I gotta man who say he gonna
give you your life back, yo.

31:50.943 --> 31:52.344
Who, Barksdale?

31:52.444 --> 31:54.780
My man say,
tell that motherfucker that

31:54.880 --> 31:57.149
if he can find a way
not to dip in our pockets,

31:57.249 --> 31:59.618
we're gonna call
this shit even.

31:59.718 --> 32:03.990
Y'all aced Bailey,
and what you did to my boy?

32:05.357 --> 32:07.326
So, y'all think after
what you did to Brandon,

32:07.426 --> 32:08.927
we supposed to find
some even on this, huh?

32:09.028 --> 32:11.397
Yo, I don't know
shit about shit, a'ight?

32:11.497 --> 32:12.864
I'm just the messenger.

32:12.965 --> 32:14.766
Whatever, man.

32:14.866 --> 32:17.269
You know there's dead
on both sides, right?

32:17.369 --> 32:19.771
And there's gonna be
a whole lot more

32:19.871 --> 32:21.440
if this beef keep up.

32:21.540 --> 32:22.874
But the truth be told,

32:22.975 --> 32:24.910
there be more soldiers
in one half than the other.

32:25.011 --> 32:26.979
You know what
I'm sayin'?

32:30.316 --> 32:32.318
Hey, look here, son,
you tell Barksdale,

32:32.418 --> 32:34.753
that he's been paid back
for what he did to my peoples.

32:34.853 --> 32:36.222
But as for
his product,

32:36.322 --> 32:39.058
well, a man's got to
earn a living, you know?

32:39.158 --> 32:41.227
I don't know nobody
called Barksdale, B.

32:41.327 --> 32:43.762
The man
I'm talking about,

32:43.862 --> 32:45.531
can't have his shit
taken like that.

32:45.631 --> 32:46.965
That won't do.

32:47.066 --> 32:49.735
A'ight, tell him
throw me some cash then,

32:49.835 --> 32:51.937
and we'll see.

32:52.038 --> 32:53.605
'Bout five
or 10,000.

32:53.705 --> 32:56.875
You know what I mean?
For my retirement, homes.

32:56.975 --> 32:59.078
Five if you can
keep quiet about it.

32:59.178 --> 33:00.846
Send my money
through Joe, man.

33:00.946 --> 33:04.516
You go through Joe,
you're not gonna see
2,000 of that.

33:04.616 --> 33:06.518
Why don't you tell
my man where you at--

33:06.618 --> 33:07.986
Naw, naw, naw, naw.

33:08.087 --> 33:09.821
We gonna figure something
else out, you heard?

33:09.921 --> 33:13.125
I'll be in touch, homes.

33:17.996 --> 33:20.132
How careful
is Stringer Bell?

33:20.232 --> 33:22.834
"I don't know no one
named Barksdale."

33:22.934 --> 33:24.336
Shit.

33:24.436 --> 33:26.338
Still we got him tied
to the Brandon killing.

33:26.438 --> 33:29.108
That can be enough
for one day's work.

33:38.450 --> 33:40.519
Did what I could
for y'all.

34:02.808 --> 34:04.110
You sure, right?

34:04.210 --> 34:06.945
Yeah, I spent a summer here
when I was nine.

34:07.045 --> 34:08.547
When was the last time
they saw you?

34:10.081 --> 34:12.851
When I was nine.

34:12.951 --> 34:15.187
( crickets chirping )

34:17.022 --> 34:19.491
- What's that?
- What?

34:19.591 --> 34:21.127
That noise.

34:21.226 --> 34:23.295
It's crickets.

34:24.362 --> 34:25.764
Cricket.

34:25.864 --> 34:27.799
Crickets.

34:32.036 --> 34:34.206
He tried to go
in my pockets again ?

34:34.306 --> 34:36.442
This nigga talkin'
'bout five Gs, B.

34:36.542 --> 34:38.076
Oh, shit.

34:38.177 --> 34:39.578
( knocking )

34:43.047 --> 34:44.183
Oh, what's up, baby?

34:44.283 --> 34:45.650
Antwon said
to bring these up.

34:45.751 --> 34:47.619
- Y'all want anything else?
- Naw, we cool.

34:47.719 --> 34:50.356
I'm sayin' though,
how we supposed to pay that?

34:50.456 --> 34:53.359
He talking about
goin' through Joe,
but I'm like, fuck Joe.

34:53.458 --> 34:57.062
Hey, yo, yo, yo, yo.
Thank you, mon amie.

34:57.163 --> 34:59.765
You look good
and your services
are appreciated.

34:59.865 --> 35:04.336
Keep them tips.
I hope you makin'
them, baby.

35:04.436 --> 35:07.906
Avon:
Make the motherfucker
come down to the towers

35:08.006 --> 35:10.309
to get the rest
of his money, you know
what I'm sayin'?

35:10.409 --> 35:13.345
If he stupid enough
to come down to the towers,
he gonna get got.

35:13.445 --> 35:16.948
It's a wrap, pow.
How you supposed
to pay that?

35:17.048 --> 35:19.318
A'ight.

35:22.254 --> 35:26.225
Y'all think you can hang,
but, look.

35:30.229 --> 35:33.865
No, no, no, you see,
I went to journalism school.

35:33.965 --> 35:35.301
All right?
Northwestern.

35:35.401 --> 35:37.269
So, y'all can't stay
with me on this.

35:37.369 --> 35:39.605
Girl, you talkin' like
you some crusty old reporter.

35:40.872 --> 35:41.940
Well, excuse me?

35:42.040 --> 35:43.942
Bitch, you work
at a TV station.

35:44.042 --> 35:46.845
It's the same thing,
all right?

35:46.945 --> 35:48.880
Look, come on,
stop talkin'.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.616
Here we go.

35:52.484 --> 35:55.020
- Bring it.
- Come on, Kima.

35:55.120 --> 35:56.988
Come on.

35:57.088 --> 35:58.990
I gotta work tomorrow.

35:59.090 --> 36:00.926
All: Aw!

36:01.026 --> 36:03.229
Candy ass.

36:03.329 --> 36:05.564
That's all
I have to say.

36:07.299 --> 36:09.568
Okay, you see?

36:09.668 --> 36:11.770
- I'm with you.
- All right.

36:11.870 --> 36:14.740
Look at Tonya.
And she run a damn
art gallery.

36:14.840 --> 36:19.578
You see, police in
this town ain't about shit.

36:22.080 --> 36:23.949
- Guess not.
- Mm-hmm, thank you.

36:25.317 --> 36:26.852
- Can't hold our liquor.
- Mm-mmm.

36:28.086 --> 36:30.222
Can't hold a donut.

36:30.322 --> 36:32.458
( laughing )

36:34.460 --> 36:35.861
And if you ask me,
I guess we...

36:37.296 --> 36:39.365
ain't good in bed,
neither.

36:39.465 --> 36:41.767
Oh, don't go there,
Officer.

36:41.867 --> 36:43.602
Don't go there.

36:45.837 --> 36:47.873
Kima, how did you know
you wanted to be a cop?

36:49.207 --> 36:50.609
I mean, how did
you choose that?

36:52.478 --> 36:56.415
When you were little, did you
think about it at all, or...

36:58.284 --> 37:01.152
Come on, Kima.

37:01.253 --> 37:03.322
I remember when I was
in the northeast,

37:03.422 --> 37:05.624
still field-training
as a cadet.

37:05.724 --> 37:08.627
I didn't know if I was gonna
stick with it or not.

37:08.727 --> 37:11.062
And then we got
this one call.

37:11.162 --> 37:14.966
We chased this purse-snatch
up into these apartments.

37:15.066 --> 37:17.336
I got separated
from my FTO

37:17.436 --> 37:20.105
and shit, I ain't
even no police yet.

37:20.205 --> 37:22.974
You know,
I'm just a trainee.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.876
And I'm alone.

37:26.312 --> 37:28.046
Anyway, I mean,

37:28.146 --> 37:29.615
I don't know how,
but I find the guy.

37:31.283 --> 37:33.385
So I catch him
and I hold on to him

37:33.485 --> 37:36.121
and I manage
to get to my radio.

37:36.221 --> 37:38.357
And we in the middle
of this parking lot,

37:38.457 --> 37:40.191
and we're rolling
around and shit

37:40.292 --> 37:44.262
and this motherfucker's
steady kicking my ass
trying to get away.

37:44.363 --> 37:47.399
And I look over and I see
these black patents,

37:47.499 --> 37:50.135
and these uniform
blue pants.

37:50.235 --> 37:54.272
I look up
and it's Charlie Smoot.

37:55.774 --> 37:59.144
Charlie fucking Smoot.
You know, this guy's a legend.

37:59.244 --> 38:00.646
He looks down at me
and he smiles,

38:02.381 --> 38:03.849
you know
real quiet-like.

38:03.949 --> 38:05.884
And he drops his cuffs.

38:05.984 --> 38:07.953
He says,
"Here ya go, rook."

38:09.455 --> 38:12.157
That's all he says.

38:12.257 --> 38:14.626
"Here ya go, rook."

38:14.726 --> 38:18.930
And then he dropped
the bracelets and walked away.

38:22.668 --> 38:25.070
I mean, I know
you don't like it.

38:27.172 --> 38:30.376
But, shit,
I was proud.

38:37.683 --> 38:39.485
Ooh.

38:41.186 --> 38:43.489
Goddamn.

39:29.935 --> 39:32.370
Lester says we ain't gonna
write a warrant on this place.

39:32.471 --> 39:34.372
How do we not
with all this PC?

39:34.473 --> 39:36.775
Greggs:
We're on the main stash,
right?

39:36.875 --> 39:38.376
Why would
we kick the door in

39:38.477 --> 39:40.446
when all we have to do
is park a van down the street

39:40.546 --> 39:43.782
and follow the entire
westside drug supply in
and out of the place?

39:43.882 --> 39:46.017
We're gonna start picking up
pieces of Barksdale's world

39:46.117 --> 39:47.853
we never even
knew about.

39:47.953 --> 39:49.821
Been hell looking
for you people.

39:49.921 --> 39:51.389
What the hell's the name
of this unit anyway?

39:51.490 --> 39:55.126
- What up, Wig?
- Aw, shit, Kima in the house.

39:55.226 --> 39:57.328
- What up, Wig?
- What's up, girl?

39:57.429 --> 39:59.397
State police, CID
out of Pikesville.

39:59.498 --> 40:01.767
Name of Troy Wiggins.

40:01.867 --> 40:03.334
But pay no attention
to the man,

40:03.435 --> 40:05.070
'cause he about
90-95% pure bullshit.

40:07.238 --> 40:09.340
Kima, she just
talk like that

40:09.441 --> 40:10.942
'cause I had her
when she was good.

40:11.042 --> 40:13.278
Shit, you
the ugly-ass motherfucker

40:13.378 --> 40:15.080
- turned me the other way.
- Shit, a'ight.

40:16.515 --> 40:18.650
Here's the thing,
boys and girls.

40:18.750 --> 40:21.219
I'm doin' a reverse buy
down in Arundel, right?

40:21.319 --> 40:25.223
And I get this
westside asshole nibbling
on four ounces, right?

40:25.323 --> 40:27.893
- A whole four ounces?
- I know, he ain't much, but...

40:27.993 --> 40:30.228
I get him in the boat
and he starts floppin' around

40:30.328 --> 40:33.799
sayin' he can buy weight
from some motherfucker
name of Barksdale.

40:33.899 --> 40:35.701
I never heard
of no Barksdale.

40:35.801 --> 40:37.435
But I put
the name into Dex,

40:37.536 --> 40:39.738
and the computer
has Avon Barksdale entered

40:39.838 --> 40:42.307
as an active
Baltimore City target.

40:42.407 --> 40:44.442
So, I go down to city
narcotics and Dawson,

40:44.543 --> 40:46.444
he sends me down here
to see y'all.

40:46.545 --> 40:48.079
So, what's the name
of your fish?

40:49.314 --> 40:51.449
Wendell O, as in,

40:51.550 --> 40:54.986
Oh-Shit-I-Tried-To-Buy
From-A-State-Police Blocker.

40:55.086 --> 40:57.388
That wouldn't be
Wendell Orlando Blocker
would it?

40:57.489 --> 41:00.225
Yeah.
You on it.

41:02.528 --> 41:04.195
Orlando.

41:04.295 --> 41:05.997
They keep that
back room locked.

41:06.097 --> 41:08.700
And even if I do get
back there on an errand,

41:08.800 --> 41:11.436
then they
kinda shut down.
They get real quiet.

41:11.537 --> 41:13.939
You said you heard
one say something

41:14.039 --> 41:16.441
about making someone
come into the towers.

41:16.542 --> 41:20.378
- Yeah.
- Which one was talking?

41:20.478 --> 41:22.814
He was tall,
I think.

41:22.914 --> 41:25.483
All right,
but who else was there?

41:28.286 --> 41:31.089
I don't really see that well
without my glasses.

41:31.189 --> 41:32.891
Where are
your glasses?

41:38.363 --> 41:40.699
You can't see faces
without those?

41:43.869 --> 41:46.237
You don't wear those
while you're working,
do you, darlin'?

41:46.337 --> 41:48.239
Would you?

41:48.339 --> 41:50.976
I gotta live off
drinks and tips.

41:53.278 --> 41:54.980
- No way!
- Why not?

41:55.080 --> 41:57.182
Because a player
wouldn't be the name
on the liquor license.

41:57.282 --> 41:59.651
And a player would
have a connect for
Barksdale's coke.

41:59.751 --> 42:01.219
He wouldn't walk
into state troopers.

42:01.319 --> 42:03.655
He caught a charge and now
he's talking out his ass.

42:03.755 --> 42:05.423
I mean, face it.
You're never gonna
get Avon or Stringer

42:05.523 --> 42:07.058
in the same room
as the dope.

42:07.158 --> 42:08.794
We'll make this case
on their voices alone.

42:08.894 --> 42:10.796
So, maybe he can't
buy from Barksdale.

42:10.896 --> 42:12.931
Maybe he can only buy
from Savino or Wee-Bey.

42:13.031 --> 42:14.432
Greggs:
Well, fuck him, then.

42:14.532 --> 42:16.434
We already got Wee-Bey
tied to a murder

42:16.534 --> 42:18.570
and Savino's the runt
of the litter.

42:23.541 --> 42:26.111
We can take what Orlando
gives us about the club.

42:26.211 --> 42:28.046
The money laundering,
maybe, or the girls.

42:29.080 --> 42:30.949
For that kind
of cooperation,

42:31.049 --> 42:33.151
I'll drop a few years
and call it fair.

42:33.251 --> 42:34.820
( knocking )

42:34.920 --> 42:36.988
- Daniels in here?
- Yeah.

42:37.088 --> 42:39.424
Call from Deputy
Commissioner for you.

42:39.524 --> 42:42.193
You want it in here?

42:42.293 --> 42:44.262
No.

42:44.362 --> 42:45.697
He doesn't miss much.

42:47.766 --> 42:49.935
( pager beeping )

42:58.209 --> 42:59.745
I need
some help here.

42:59.845 --> 43:02.748
Come on, Bubs
You got me comin'
across town

43:02.848 --> 43:04.449
in the middle
of a fucked-up workday

43:04.549 --> 43:06.317
just so you can hold 10?
That shit ain't right.

43:06.417 --> 43:08.019
Hold on,
I don't need 10.

43:08.119 --> 43:09.855
Okay, I don't know.

43:09.955 --> 43:12.123
I need a place
of my own.

43:12.223 --> 43:16.361
All right, some bed,
some sheets, some clothes.

43:16.461 --> 43:18.463
I definitely need
some new clothes.

43:18.563 --> 43:21.599
How long you been clean?

43:23.301 --> 43:25.070
Three days.

43:26.571 --> 43:28.707
You serious about it?

43:30.308 --> 43:32.043
Who knows?

43:34.913 --> 43:37.749
What the fuck am I gonna do
with a clean informant?

43:37.849 --> 43:39.384
Did you think
about that?

43:44.990 --> 43:47.726
A'ight,
I'm on it with you.

43:49.360 --> 43:51.329
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

43:53.865 --> 43:55.300
Yo, what the fuck,
gimme some love.

43:56.501 --> 43:57.736
Okay, I mean,
I think I can get,

43:58.937 --> 44:00.772
you know, a mattress,
my own place,

44:00.872 --> 44:03.141
everything for like
a couple hundred dollars.

44:03.241 --> 44:05.210
A'ight.

44:05.310 --> 44:07.545
We'll talk.

44:07.645 --> 44:11.282
I gotta be somewhere tonight,
so hit me on my page tomorrow.

44:12.483 --> 44:15.053
Tomorrow?

44:15.153 --> 44:17.055
I got you.

44:21.526 --> 44:23.661
The cooperator says
he can buy weight.

44:23.762 --> 44:25.330
Daniels:
Not from Barksdale
or Bell.

44:25.430 --> 44:26.664
How can you be sure?

44:26.765 --> 44:28.266
How much dope or coke

44:28.366 --> 44:30.936
do you think
gets Avon Barksdale
into the room?

44:31.036 --> 44:31.937
A kilo?

44:32.037 --> 44:34.205
Two kilos,
20 kilos?

44:34.305 --> 44:37.675
We are not going to buy
our way up the ladder here.

44:37.776 --> 44:39.477
These people
do not touch the drugs.

44:39.577 --> 44:41.212
They don't go near
the drugs.

44:41.312 --> 44:43.915
The wire is what
gives us Barksdale.

44:44.015 --> 44:45.951
It gives us
the whole crew.

44:46.051 --> 44:49.921
Day by day,
piece by piece.

44:53.591 --> 44:56.294
Buy-bust, Lieutenant.

44:56.394 --> 44:59.497
It's what I asked
you for months ago.

44:59.597 --> 45:01.933
It's what we do
successfully

45:02.033 --> 45:05.236
time and again
to make these cases.

45:12.543 --> 45:15.046
Why New York?

45:15.146 --> 45:17.448
Must be somethin'
happenin' out there, man.

45:17.548 --> 45:19.084
Too big a town,
you know what I mean?

45:19.184 --> 45:21.452
You don't believe
in the truce?

45:21.552 --> 45:23.254
That's why I asked
for that money.

45:23.354 --> 45:26.057
If he had said,
"We ain't paying you.
Just be happy to live,"

45:26.157 --> 45:27.959
I'd have been like,
a'ight they keepin' it real.

45:28.059 --> 45:29.460
But he say, c'mon down
for $5,000,

45:30.461 --> 45:32.030
I'm, like, man, please.

45:33.264 --> 45:35.100
Hey, look here, homes,
I ain't asked for much,

45:35.200 --> 45:38.503
but, um, I'm a little light
on traveling money.

45:38.603 --> 45:41.172
I'm sayin' I could go around
the block and get myself paid,

45:41.272 --> 45:43.074
but I'm thinkin'...

45:45.610 --> 45:47.312
You keep in touch
with my pager.

45:47.412 --> 45:49.747
We're gonna need you
for the Gant trial.

45:50.816 --> 45:52.750
Go easy, Omar.

45:56.621 --> 45:58.990
Stay free!

46:01.659 --> 46:05.296
Man on tape:
You be pickin' me up outside
the Cut-Rate on Lex and Fulton.

46:05.396 --> 46:07.999
I'll be up there
after 10:00, right?

46:08.099 --> 46:09.467
Man 2:
That'll work.

46:09.567 --> 46:11.502
Listen up, people.

46:11.602 --> 46:13.905
We've got 30,000
in buy money

46:14.005 --> 46:15.506
courtesy of our friends
over at DEA,

46:15.606 --> 46:17.308
but the thing is,

46:17.408 --> 46:19.110
they can't have that
money walkin' on them.

46:19.210 --> 46:20.745
Definitely not.

46:20.846 --> 46:23.882
So Kima will be
in the car for the buy,
fronting as our CI's girl.

46:23.982 --> 46:25.516
Lookin' the part, too.

46:25.616 --> 46:27.953
( laughs )

46:28.053 --> 46:29.320
Now, where's your
weapon gonna be?

46:29.420 --> 46:31.656
He might pat me,
so it has to stash
in the car.

46:31.756 --> 46:34.025
I figure when Savino
gets in the car
at the Cut-Rate,

46:34.125 --> 46:35.493
I'll be going in back.

46:35.593 --> 46:37.328
It'll be up under
the rear seat.

46:37.428 --> 46:41.499
And we probably
can't be close enough
for an eyeball on this,

46:41.599 --> 46:43.268
but the car
will be a live wire

46:43.368 --> 46:45.503
and Kima will be throwin' us
20s whenever she can.

46:45.603 --> 46:47.038
Rhonda?

46:47.138 --> 46:49.074
I only want to remind
Mr. Blocker here

46:49.174 --> 46:52.110
that his plea agreement
is contingent on cooperation.

46:52.210 --> 46:55.346
A buy-bust on Savino Bratton
is less cooperative

46:55.446 --> 46:58.216
than a buy-bust from someone
higher up on the food chain.

46:58.316 --> 47:01.086
If you can get Savino
talking about Avon or Stringer,

47:01.186 --> 47:03.288
that's better for us
and better for you.

47:03.388 --> 47:06.157
They already know
that he got jacked
on a reverse buy, right?

47:06.257 --> 47:08.293
Why wouldn't they assume
he's snitchin'?

47:08.393 --> 47:10.795
I need money
for a lawyer, right?

47:10.896 --> 47:12.463
That's the story.

47:12.563 --> 47:14.299
He got popped
and now he needs

47:14.399 --> 47:17.368
to get right back into it
to pay the bondsman
and the lawyer.

47:17.468 --> 47:19.504
All right.

47:19.604 --> 47:21.239
Let's make this work.

47:23.608 --> 47:25.010
Careful.

47:25.110 --> 47:26.511
That's my career
you're holding there.

47:28.179 --> 47:30.148
- You got a unit?
- Parked in the mezzanine.

47:30.248 --> 47:32.550
- Gimme the keys, man.
- Naw, I'm driving,
motherfucker.

47:33.618 --> 47:35.453
Come on, man.

48:12.623 --> 48:14.892
Death row here.

48:14.993 --> 48:17.362
Ain't up.

48:18.629 --> 48:20.465
Death row.

48:28.039 --> 48:30.475
( car radio playing )

48:48.994 --> 48:51.997
That's my girl.
Half the money hers.

48:54.665 --> 48:56.601
( turns up radio )

49:04.342 --> 49:06.311
Baby, since we goin'
down North Avenue,

49:06.411 --> 49:09.314
stop by the carry-out
so I can pick me up
some cigarettes.

49:09.414 --> 49:11.216
They're goin' up North,
stay loose.

49:14.619 --> 49:16.387
( turns up radio )

49:18.623 --> 49:20.958
- Shit.
- It's too loud.

49:37.875 --> 49:40.378
Does any unit
have the eyeball?

49:41.546 --> 49:43.948
Negative, 11-35.

49:44.049 --> 49:47.018
C'mon, Greggs, tell us
where the fuck you are.

49:47.985 --> 49:49.754
Pull in there.

49:49.854 --> 49:51.322
What?

49:51.422 --> 49:53.291
Pull in there.

50:10.608 --> 50:12.043
( music stops )

50:12.143 --> 50:13.611
( baby crying )

50:15.146 --> 50:17.282
Don't fuck
with this count.

50:19.284 --> 50:21.552
I'll be right back
with your shit.

50:32.530 --> 50:34.031
Where are we?

50:34.132 --> 50:37.335
That sign said Longwood,
but I could swear
this was Warwick.

50:37.435 --> 50:40.505
Hoppers be turning
the sign poles
to fuck with y'all.

50:42.507 --> 50:45.476
I make it we're on
the north side of Warwick,

50:45.576 --> 50:47.011
in an alley.

50:47.112 --> 50:49.080
I don't know, shit,

50:49.180 --> 50:51.616
half of block west
of Longwood, maybe?

50:51.716 --> 50:53.218
I hope y'all
copy that.

50:53.318 --> 50:55.420
Yeah, that puts us
about eight blocks away.

50:55.520 --> 50:57.422
