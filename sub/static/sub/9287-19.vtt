00:02.273 --> 00:06.585
Since the transgenics escaped
into our streets seven months ago,

00:06.673 --> 00:10.268
the crime rate has spiked 12%
in the city of Seattle alone.

00:10.353 --> 00:12.867
In Portland, an unknown viral agent

00:12.953 --> 00:17.071
has claimed the lives of 39 citizens -
this is more than just a coincidence.

00:17.153 --> 00:21.351
- You got that right.
- They are violent, many of them are diseased.

00:21.433 --> 00:25.028
This committee wants to know,
the American people want to know,

00:25.113 --> 00:28.662
how many of them are out there, and
how do we contain the threat they pose?

00:28.753 --> 00:31.551
- Smoke 'em out and string 'em up.
- Senator James McKinley,

00:31.633 --> 00:34.784
Chair of the Congressional Task Force
on the transgenic threat.

00:36.753 --> 00:38.948
That's good. That's good.

00:42.753 --> 00:43.947
Nice.

00:48.273 --> 00:50.867
- Hey.
- It wasn't me.

00:50.953 --> 00:53.706
- Grow up.
- What?

01:00.233 --> 01:03.031
I just wanna get through my day
without seeing one of those.

01:03.113 --> 01:05.866
Don't look like him.
Doggie-dog is way better-lookin'.

01:08.473 --> 01:11.226
It's me.

01:11.313 --> 01:14.623
- Hoping it was Logan?
- Don't know why I would. It's over.

01:15.873 --> 01:19.149
- Wouldn't be so sure about that.
- Thing is...

01:19.233 --> 01:23.784
- I kinda told him I was seein' someone.
- What? Who?

01:24.433 --> 01:26.344
Hey, ladies.

01:27.353 --> 01:31.346
- You've gotta be kiddin'.
- It was the only way after what happened.

01:31.433 --> 01:34.903
I know myself. I'd forget about
the virus, hang with him again...

01:34.993 --> 01:37.666
And sooner or later, you'd
accidentally touch again.

01:37.753 --> 01:40.711
I can't risk it.

01:40.793 --> 01:44.229
- Does he know he's your new squeeze?
- Hell, no!

01:44.313 --> 01:47.066
- Are you gonna tell him?
- Not if I can help it.

01:47.753 --> 01:51.462
I'm tellin' you, Normal.
Just come see for yourself.

01:56.273 --> 01:59.788
Paper dumped the mutant story
once the mainstream press got it.

01:59.873 --> 02:01.670
Now they got me on a made-up article

02:01.753 --> 02:05.666
about some bogus
10,000-year-old breeding cult.

02:05.753 --> 02:08.187
Get down, freak. Now.

02:08.713 --> 02:10.465
- What?
- Down, you mutant bastard!

02:10.553 --> 02:13.272
- Are you crazy?
- You got three seconds! Get down!

02:18.953 --> 02:20.989
- Hey!
- What the hell are you doing?

02:21.073 --> 02:23.268
He's one of them! He's got a bar code.

02:28.673 --> 02:31.392
Well, he coulda been one. Anybody could be.

02:31.793 --> 02:34.068
Let that be a lesson to all of you. Vigilance.

02:34.153 --> 02:36.792
Go wash your neck.
You, get in my office now.

02:37.873 --> 02:41.468
All right. Crash, anyone?
Huh? I'm buyin'. Sky?

02:43.753 --> 02:45.983
- You comin'?
- No.

02:51.153 --> 02:53.747
- Girl's got quite an arm on her.
- She does.

02:59.553 --> 03:01.669
I remember when I first got here.

03:01.753 --> 03:03.744
How it felt so right.

03:04.553 --> 03:06.544
Like home.

03:07.473 --> 03:10.306
Never figured things
would get so screwed up.

03:12.313 --> 03:15.749
Maybe it'd all be just as bad
if I'd gone somewhere else.

03:17.233 --> 03:19.827
But then again, maybe not.

03:32.273 --> 03:34.662
I'm home!

03:34.753 --> 03:39.110
- I got an A in my spelling test.
- That's great! Did you show Dad?

03:39.193 --> 03:41.184
- Hey, hon.
- Hey.

03:41.833 --> 03:44.552
Get cleaned up, kiddo. It's chow time.

03:44.633 --> 03:44.953
- This is awesome.
- I know.

03:44.953 --> 03:46.386
- This is awesome.
- I know.

03:50.753 --> 03:52.744
- Munchkin down?
- Yeah.

03:54.473 --> 03:57.545
So, I got Friday off,
so we can get ahead of traffic

03:57.633 --> 04:01.023
and maybe try and do some night skiing.

04:01.113 --> 04:03.707
Or maybe some hot-tubbing under the stars?

04:03.793 --> 04:05.784
Sounds even better.

04:19.873 --> 04:22.785
- Get him and the kid outta here.
- No!

04:22.873 --> 04:25.865
- Mom!
- You're a long way from your usual haunts.

04:25.953 --> 04:30.071
- What are you talking about?
- Did you think you could hide from me, 452?

04:30.153 --> 04:33.782
- Oh, God.
- What, no witty rejoinders today?

04:34.553 --> 04:36.862
My designation is 453.

04:38.313 --> 04:39.985
- What?
- 453.

04:42.993 --> 04:45.063
- I can't believe this.
- What's wrong?

04:45.153 --> 04:46.666
- It's not her.
- It isn't?

04:46.753 --> 04:48.744
It's a clone.

04:48.833 --> 04:50.903
A clone? Get her outta here!

04:53.273 --> 04:57.949
They designed her to be the perfect soldier,
a human weapon.

04:58.033 --> 05:00.024
Then she escaped.

05:00.113 --> 05:04.470
In a future not far from now,
in a broken world,

05:04.553 --> 05:06.862
she is haunted by her past.

05:06.953 --> 05:11.947
She cannot run.
She must fight to discover her destiny.

05:50.953 --> 05:52.944
Hey, Joshua.

05:58.993 --> 06:01.268
I brought you some stuff.

06:03.193 --> 06:05.468
Easel's over there.

06:18.153 --> 06:20.303
What's up with this map?

06:22.393 --> 06:27.342
It's Terminal City. There was
a biochemical accident in Sector Seven.

06:27.433 --> 06:29.742
- It's a fenced-in area.
- Been there.

06:29.833 --> 06:31.869
There isn't much to see.

06:31.953 --> 06:35.070
People go there when they have
nowhere to go and nothin' to lose.

06:35.153 --> 06:37.462
Like downstairs people. Transhumans.

06:37.553 --> 06:39.544
- Who told you that?
- Alec.

06:40.713 --> 06:43.989
- Why didn't you, Max?
- Because it's dangerous there.

06:44.073 --> 06:47.702
- Yeah. But we're immune. It doesn't matter.
- And this is your home.

06:50.313 --> 06:53.544
Under this mess, anyway.
So forget about Terminal City.

06:53.633 --> 06:55.510
- I'll help you clean up.
- No.

06:55.593 --> 06:58.471
- It's OK. I don't mind.
- Leave it!

06:58.553 --> 07:01.021
- Joshua.
- Everything here reminds me of Annie.

07:02.073 --> 07:06.351
Books, chairs, sitting, eating...

07:08.233 --> 07:10.542
Painting...

07:11.713 --> 07:14.386
This is not my home any more, Max.

07:16.513 --> 07:18.902
You have to hang on.

07:18.993 --> 07:22.622
It'll get better, I promise.

07:27.553 --> 07:29.669
Do not attempt to adjust your set.

07:29.753 --> 07:32.904
This is an Eyes Only
Streaming Freedom Video bulletin.

07:32.993 --> 07:35.553
The cable hack will last exactly 60 seconds.

07:35.633 --> 07:37.863
It cannot be traced, it cannot be stopped,

07:37.953 --> 07:40.262
and it is the only free voice left in this city.

07:40.353 --> 07:44.983
Lately, every crime, every act of violence
committed on our city's streets

07:45.073 --> 07:47.382
is being blamed on transgenics.

07:47.473 --> 07:49.589
60 seconds enough time for a trace?

07:49.673 --> 07:53.063
He gets started on this transgenic
thing, sometimes he goes over.

07:53.153 --> 07:58.546
- Keep ramblin', pal.
...cutback in food aid. Don't believe the hype.

07:58.953 --> 08:03.504
This has been an Eyes Only Streaming
Freedom Video bulletin. Peace. Out.

08:05.393 --> 08:08.669
Damn. Few more seconds,
we woulda had him.

08:08.753 --> 08:13.952
Remind our Korean friends that if they
don't come through, they don't get paid.

08:14.033 --> 08:15.182
Sir.

08:19.953 --> 08:22.387
453's DNA assay just came back.

08:25.473 --> 08:28.192
So you're the cheap knock-off.

08:28.713 --> 08:31.671
See, 452 doesn't have any junk DNA.

08:31.753 --> 08:36.462
Every base pair sequence she's got
is coded with genetic information.

08:37.913 --> 08:40.347
- I'd like to know why.
- You should ask her.

08:40.433 --> 08:42.549
- Where is she?
- How should I know?

08:42.633 --> 08:45.022
You mean you haven't
been in contact with her?

08:45.113 --> 08:47.308
- Why would I?
- Because she broke you out,

08:47.393 --> 08:50.510
- along with all the other mutants.
- I was already out.

08:50.593 --> 08:54.586
I was on a deep cover mission for two years.
Industrial espionage.

08:54.673 --> 08:59.872
So that poor sap that you're married to,
he was just part of your cover?

08:59.953 --> 09:04.344
At first. But when I found out
Manticore went down, I...

09:04.433 --> 09:08.108
You fell in love with him
and wanted to adopt his little boy.

09:10.233 --> 09:13.862
I'm sorry. I'm tearing up
here a little bit. How sweet.

09:13.953 --> 09:18.743
Where are they? They don't know anything.

09:18.833 --> 09:21.188
You never told them you were built in a lab?

09:22.193 --> 09:25.549
- Please.
- They're fine. And you will see them again.

09:26.553 --> 09:28.669
After you help me find 452.

09:28.753 --> 09:30.744
I told you. I don't know where she is.

09:30.833 --> 09:33.301
Well, you're in luck,
because I have a lead for you.

09:33.393 --> 09:36.863
See, she turned up
at a local hospital a while back.

09:38.313 --> 09:40.781
Really stirred things up.
The CDC was brought in,

09:40.873 --> 09:43.393
and her doctor told them that he didn't
have any idea she was transgenic.

09:43.393 --> 09:44.792
And her doctor told them that he didn't
have any idea she was transgenic.

09:44.873 --> 09:47.910
And you think
he knows more than he's letting on.

09:47.993 --> 09:52.191
Now, we had him under surveillance for
a while, hoping that she'd turn up again,

09:52.273 --> 09:57.825
- but now that I have you, why wait?
- What do you want me to do?

09:57.913 --> 10:01.872
I want you to find out
everything he knows about her,

10:01.953 --> 10:04.342
which shouldn't be too hard, considering.

10:04.433 --> 10:07.584
- And then I want you to find her.
- And my family?

10:08.833 --> 10:12.428
You pull this off,
and the three of you are free to go.

10:19.153 --> 10:23.351
I know what you're thinkin'.
You're thinkin' "I could kill him right now."

10:23.433 --> 10:26.584
- But you won't.
- You seem pretty sure of yourself.

10:26.673 --> 10:32.225
You won't do anything to endanger your
family. I know this because I have family too.

10:32.313 --> 10:36.386
Or, at least, I did,
before 452 took my son away.

10:38.033 --> 10:40.263
I am very motivated.

10:41.633 --> 10:45.262
And I wanna find her really badly.

10:45.953 --> 10:48.513
I am not a patient man.

10:48.593 --> 10:50.629
Don't let me down.

10:58.193 --> 11:00.866
OK. Raise your right leg.

11:01.993 --> 11:03.984
Good. Now the left.

11:05.113 --> 11:08.150
- OK. Good.
- So, what do you think?

11:08.233 --> 11:11.589
This is your second go around
with transfusions of transgenic blood.

11:11.673 --> 11:15.109
We both know what happened.
Nerve cell regeneration didn't last,

11:15.193 --> 11:17.787
- and you lost mobility again.
- This is different.

11:17.873 --> 11:22.071
Last time, nothing happened for weeks
afterwards. This time, it was instantaneous.

11:22.153 --> 11:27.546
Maybe you're right. Maybe this time it'll
stick. Bottom line is, only time will tell.

11:53.193 --> 11:55.627
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:06.833 --> 12:09.347
Max! You scared the hell outta me.

12:09.433 --> 12:11.867
- Sorry.
- You know, you just missed Logan.

12:11.953 --> 12:15.070
Logan? Huh. That's too bad.

12:15.153 --> 12:18.702
- So what brings you by?
- I was wondering if

12:19.713 --> 12:23.103
- I could take a look at my file.
- You're kidding, right?

12:23.193 --> 12:25.753
You asked me to get rid of it. I did.

12:25.833 --> 12:30.543
- Right. Thanks.
- The CDC's still asking questions about you.

12:30.913 --> 12:33.746
I jut keep tellin' them I don't know anything.

12:34.673 --> 12:37.790
I was wondering
if you could take a look at my back.

12:37.873 --> 12:40.307
I'm having a muscle spasm. Check it out.

12:41.073 --> 12:43.268
Let me have a look.

12:43.833 --> 12:47.462
Maybe you can write me a prescription.
I'm kinda low on cash.

12:47.553 --> 12:49.353
Jam Pony doesn't have
much of a health plan, huh?

12:49.353 --> 12:50.706
Jam Pony doesn't have
much of a health plan, huh?

12:50.793 --> 12:54.581
- Not really.
- Well, there's nothing unusual here.

12:54.673 --> 12:58.222
Could be some nerve damage
from when you were shot.

13:00.273 --> 13:04.471
Max, there's no wound here.
This just happened a few weeks ago.

13:04.553 --> 13:06.828
- I heal fast.
- Not that fast, you don't.

13:08.753 --> 13:12.348
The people who sent me won't like that
you lied about how well you know Max.

13:12.433 --> 13:15.743
So when you wake up, grab your family
and get the hell outta town.

13:15.833 --> 13:17.824
What are you talking about?

13:22.273 --> 13:24.264
There she is.

13:25.233 --> 13:27.428
- Don't lose her.
- What the...

13:47.713 --> 13:50.466
If I'm onto you,
then she'll be onto you. Got it?

13:51.913 --> 13:54.552
Good boy. Tell your boss I work alone.

14:00.553 --> 14:02.828
You were here.
You saw the way she muscled me.

14:02.913 --> 14:06.349
Yeah. She's been workin' out a lot.
What are you guys gettin' at?

14:06.433 --> 14:09.470
That maybe we got the wrong person.
Sky isn't a transgenic.

14:09.553 --> 14:12.386
- And Max is?
- Look, man, I don't wanna believe it either.

14:12.473 --> 14:14.748
But I'll peek to see if she's got a bar code.

14:14.833 --> 14:18.223
These trannies are fiendishly clever.
She could have had it removed.

14:18.313 --> 14:20.907
True. Not having a bar code
doesn't prove anything.

14:20.993 --> 14:23.348
I don't know, guys,
I mean, listen to yourselves.

14:23.433 --> 14:29.190
You know, if she's a witch she'll float, if she's
not she'll drown. Either way, she's guilty.

14:34.953 --> 14:36.944
Max. Hold up, hold up.

14:38.353 --> 14:42.505
- What are you doing?
- I thought so. You need a laser touch-up.

14:42.593 --> 14:45.061
- Thanks for the tip.
- Hold on. You can't go in there.

14:45.153 --> 14:50.352
Normal and Sketchy are trippin' about
your little stunt you pulled yesterday.

14:50.433 --> 14:54.711
Go to Joshua's. I'll meet you
there later, all right? Go. Go.

15:14.313 --> 15:17.828
You'll get caught.
You won't even make it to Terminal City.

15:17.913 --> 15:20.985
- I'll take the sewers.
- Why are you doing this?

15:21.473 --> 15:23.464
I can't be with upstairs people.

15:24.833 --> 15:27.666
- I don't wanna be alone any more.
- You won't have to be.

15:27.753 --> 15:31.223
- I'll come every day.
- You come, then you go.

15:31.313 --> 15:34.988
Then I'm alone. I'm tired of being alone, Max.

15:35.073 --> 15:37.712
If you go to Terminal City,
I can't look after you.

15:37.793 --> 15:40.546
You don't have to look after me, Max.

15:40.633 --> 15:43.909
I can look after myself.
At Manticore, I took care of myself.

15:43.993 --> 15:46.427
- And everybody else.
- It's different out here.

15:46.513 --> 15:49.823
No! I'm talking now. You listen.

15:50.673 --> 15:55.428
I don't wanna hide any more.
I need to be with people like me.

15:56.833 --> 16:01.349
Fine. You wanna go, live in toxic waste,
eat rats for dinner, be my guest.

16:06.313 --> 16:08.304
Joshua?

16:22.393 --> 16:24.588
Goodbye, little fella.

16:32.633 --> 16:35.909
- I've been subpoenaed.
- Yes. I know.

16:35.993 --> 16:40.828
McKinley's committee. The good senator
is determined to blow this thing wide open.

16:40.913 --> 16:44.064
Needless to say, we're taking the Fifth.

16:44.153 --> 16:46.428
- Sir...
- I don't want to hear it.

16:46.513 --> 16:49.027
Right now your priority
is to maintain your cover.

16:49.113 --> 16:51.149
Not capturing transgenics.

16:51.233 --> 16:54.908
As far as anyone needs to know,
they don't exist.

16:55.393 --> 16:57.349
- Understand?
- Perfectly, sir.

16:57.433 --> 17:00.630
Well, then, I'll see you
in Washington on Thursday.

17:00.713 --> 17:03.022
Very good.

17:04.032 --> 17:06.342
Don't wear a black suit.

17:12.833 --> 17:16.791
- How're we comin'?
- We got a partial trace from his last hack.

17:16.873 --> 17:19.671
With any luck, we should lock on
his position next time.

17:19.752 --> 17:23.507
Good. I'm gettin' tired
of lookin' at this guy's mug.

17:25.953 --> 17:28.911
And you are not tailing 453 because...?

17:29.193 --> 17:32.185
She made us, sir.
Shot out our tyres and took off.

17:32.593 --> 17:34.709
Said to tell you she works alone.

17:35.713 --> 17:39.069
That's my girl. Good to know she's on-board.

18:08.473 --> 18:10.668
Max.

18:10.753 --> 18:13.870
- Yeah?
- So you are speaking to me.

18:13.953 --> 18:16.751
- I guess I should be flattered.
- What do you mean?

18:16.833 --> 18:20.542
This morning, outside Sam Carr's office?

18:20.633 --> 18:22.589
- Logan.
- Yeah.

18:22.993 --> 18:25.268
I'm sorry. I was in a hurry.

18:25.353 --> 18:27.503
Great. In a hurry.

18:27.593 --> 18:31.552
It's bad enough
that you won't return my calls or come over,

18:31.633 --> 18:36.753
but just because you're seeing someone else
now, you're gonna treat me like a stranger?

18:38.753 --> 18:41.950
Yeah. I already told you. It's over.

18:46.193 --> 18:48.661
What do you mean, "leaving town"?

18:48.753 --> 18:52.268
White's on my ass 24/7,
I can't go back to work.

18:52.353 --> 18:56.392
I can't see Logan, and Joshua said
he doesn't need me any more.

18:56.473 --> 19:00.182
- Why am I staying here?
- I'm here, for one.

19:00.273 --> 19:02.992
And one day,
White's men will bust through that door,

19:03.073 --> 19:05.382
and you'll get caught in the crossfire.

19:05.473 --> 19:05.633
- I'll kick their asses.
- I'm serious.

19:05.633 --> 19:07.703
- I'll kick their asses.
- I'm serious.

19:08.193 --> 19:11.469
I've stayed too long.
I need to go somewhere new.

19:12.473 --> 19:17.308
Where nobody knows who I am, and I don't
have to worry about anybody but myself.

19:18.753 --> 19:21.267
You think that's gonna make you happy?

19:23.073 --> 19:25.587
Maybe.

19:29.193 --> 19:31.229
What about Logan?

19:31.313 --> 19:34.623
He's better off without me in the picture.

19:34.713 --> 19:37.989
- If you say so.
- He'll be fine.

19:38.073 --> 19:40.223
He's got his whole Eyes Only thing.

20:00.033 --> 20:05.061
Do not attempt to adjust your set. This is an
Eyes Only Streaming Freedom Video bulletin.

20:05.153 --> 20:08.031
The cable hack will last exactly 60 seconds.

20:08.113 --> 20:12.823
It cannot be traced, it cannot be stopped,
and it is the only free voice left in this city.

20:12.913 --> 20:17.304
The so-called transgenic threat
has continued to dominate the news,

20:17.393 --> 20:19.861
but as usual, the facts...

20:26.153 --> 20:27.222
Got him.

20:30.913 --> 20:33.473
This is the last
you'll hear from me for a while.

20:33.553 --> 20:37.023
Stay strong in the struggle. Peace. Out.

20:42.833 --> 20:44.824
This is not good.

21:09.193 --> 21:12.071
Keep an eye on this one.
Won't give her home address.

21:12.153 --> 21:14.587
Rooms with Nubian princess.

21:14.673 --> 21:17.187
Nubian princess?

21:21.713 --> 21:24.591
Cindy. 339 Waverley.

22:05.993 --> 22:08.188
Don't move.

22:08.273 --> 22:10.548
It's all right.

22:11.753 --> 22:13.345
He's one of us.

22:23.593 --> 22:25.982
Max! Josh! Where are you guys?

23:31.033 --> 23:34.025
Are you gonna call him
and tell him you're goin'?

24:02.073 --> 24:04.906
Before you go, there's somethin' I wanna say.

24:07.833 --> 24:11.872
You, Max Guevara, are my sister.

24:13.793 --> 24:15.988
You are my family.

24:17.433 --> 24:19.264
I love you.

24:20.273 --> 24:22.104
I love you too.

24:28.713 --> 24:30.908
You take care of yourself, OK?

24:30.993 --> 24:33.063
You too.

25:07.433 --> 25:09.503
Great. Now I'm seeing her everywhere.

26:10.993 --> 26:13.985
- Yeah.
- It's 453. I have her.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.109
- Is she secure?
- Not goin' anywhere.

26:16.193 --> 26:18.423
- Where are you?
- An abandoned building.

26:18.513 --> 26:22.062
- Corner of Parish and Beechwood.
- All right, I'm on my way.

26:42.153 --> 26:44.303
Fe'nos tol.

26:44.393 --> 26:46.463
Tell the Conclave I've found 452.

26:48.353 --> 26:50.548
I'll bring her to you.

26:53.153 --> 26:55.542
Once I find out where she took my son.

27:00.273 --> 27:02.741
You look familiar. Have we met before?

27:04.233 --> 27:06.269
Yeah. In a test tube.

27:06.353 --> 27:10.187
- Who came first? Me or you?
- I'm 453.

27:11.393 --> 27:15.432
- Do what your big sister says and untie me.
- "Sister"? Yeah, right.

27:17.113 --> 27:19.229
I'm gonna tell Mom and Dad.

27:19.593 --> 27:21.663
Tell them I quit, till yesterday.

27:23.513 --> 27:27.108
So. Looks like I interrupted a little vacation.

27:27.193 --> 27:30.185
- Or were you skipping town?
- Somethin' like that.

27:30.993 --> 27:34.349
- Same old 452.
- What's that supposed to mean?

27:35.473 --> 27:37.782
It's what you do, isn't it?

27:37.873 --> 27:39.864
Run away.

27:41.593 --> 27:45.222
Like when it got too rough
for you back at Manticore?

27:45.313 --> 27:49.909
I bet you never once stopped to think
about what they'd do to the rest of us.

27:49.993 --> 27:54.908
They wanted to make sure it wouldn't
happen again, so they tightened the leash.

27:56.273 --> 27:59.106
We got the worst of it, your twins.

28:00.193 --> 28:04.027
Manticore figured, since we had the same
basic psychological make-up as you 12,

28:04.113 --> 28:06.263
we were the greatest flight risks.

28:07.153 --> 28:09.792
So they hauled us
into Psy-Ops for evaluation.

28:14.593 --> 28:16.982
Six months.

28:17.993 --> 28:20.985
You have no idea what
they put us through, do you?

28:21.073 --> 28:25.669
While you were out in the world,
living the dream, we paid the price.

28:25.753 --> 28:28.108
"Living the dream" isn't exactly how I'd put it.

28:28.193 --> 28:30.548
So it's too tough for you out here, too?

28:32.753 --> 28:36.905
I guess I don't feel so bad
about turning you over to White, then.

28:38.073 --> 28:40.109
See, he got onto me because of you.

28:40.193 --> 28:43.151
It's been ten years since
the first time you ruined my life.

28:43.233 --> 28:46.145
I'll be damned if I let that happen again.

28:48.833 --> 28:52.189
- You have power.
- I put together a generator from car parts.

28:52.273 --> 28:54.264
That's what I do. I build stuff.

28:54.633 --> 28:57.227
Do you have any skills?
Special talents we could use?

28:57.313 --> 29:00.066
- I paint.
- Paint?

29:00.153 --> 29:03.987
I don't know. I guess a couple of new coats
could brighten up the place.

29:04.073 --> 29:06.906
- No, pictures. I paint pictures.
- Oh.

29:07.713 --> 29:09.704
Pictures. Right.

29:11.473 --> 29:13.703
- Where'd you get these?
- Stole 'em.

29:14.233 --> 29:17.987
They're a little old, but they keep
the ordinaries off our backs.

29:18.073 --> 29:20.906
- "Ordinaries"?
- Humans.

29:20.993 --> 29:25.703
Yeah. They stay away from Terminal City,
because the biotoxins make 'em sick.

29:25.793 --> 29:29.069
Not us, though. No, we do just fine, huh?

29:29.153 --> 29:33.624
City's full of transgenics. Must be ten
different groups between here and Oak Street.

29:33.713 --> 29:36.147
Everyone tends to stick with their own kind.

29:36.233 --> 29:39.145
Yeah. Xs with Xs, freaks with freaks.

29:39.233 --> 29:41.303
I guess that means you're with us.

29:41.873 --> 29:44.228
Give you any weapons training at Manticore?

29:44.313 --> 29:46.383
No.

29:46.473 --> 29:49.306
I'll teach you what you need to know.

29:49.393 --> 29:53.432
We're not looking for trouble.
We just wanna be left alone.

29:53.753 --> 29:55.983
Dix. Someone's outside.

30:05.633 --> 30:08.022
- Don't move.
- Hey, fellas.

30:09.353 --> 30:11.423
What happened to you?

30:11.793 --> 30:14.353
- What are you doing here?
- I'm X5.

30:14.433 --> 30:16.389
Then go to Oak Street with your own kind.

30:16.473 --> 30:19.465
Well, I'm lookin' for a friend of mine.
One of your kind.

30:19.793 --> 30:21.784
You've found him.

30:33.633 --> 30:36.830
- You're married?
- I have a husband and a little boy.

30:38.073 --> 30:40.303
- You're lucky.
- Yeah.

30:40.873 --> 30:42.864
You know, I had a nice normal life.

30:42.953 --> 30:46.787
Until White came looking for you
and found me instead.

30:47.753 --> 30:50.586
He has them. I'm sorry.

30:50.673 --> 30:55.269
Yeah, well. I get them back
once I turn you over to him.

30:55.353 --> 30:58.823
- That's if he keeps his word.
- Don't have a lot of options, do I?

30:59.353 --> 31:03.631
This is my family.
Maybe you don't know what that means.

31:03.713 --> 31:08.150
Maybe you'd just run off
and save your own hide like you always do.

31:09.713 --> 31:11.465
Not me.

31:29.393 --> 31:31.384
- Logan!
- You OK?

31:31.473 --> 31:33.464
Untie me! Hurry!

31:36.073 --> 31:38.223
- What?
- How do I know it's really you?

31:41.513 --> 31:43.469
Logan?

31:43.553 --> 31:45.828
- Max?
- Logan!

31:45.913 --> 31:47.551
Don't untie her!

31:54.313 --> 31:56.508
That guy's really stuck on you, huh?

31:56.593 --> 31:59.869
I thought I was a bitch, but you take the prize.

32:36.753 --> 32:41.224
- It's no use. I've had ten years of training.
- Well, they didn't teach you to fight dirty.

33:06.153 --> 33:08.906
- Where the hell have you been?
- I had a thing.

33:11.833 --> 33:13.824
Where's my family?

33:15.193 --> 33:17.388
All in good time, 453.

33:17.473 --> 33:19.464
Yeah, right.

33:25.913 --> 33:29.701
Ames White.
I oughta put a bullet in your head.

33:30.073 --> 33:34.271
But 20-odd years ago, me and her
got cooked up in the same test tube.

33:34.873 --> 33:38.343
- So in my book, that makes us sisters.
- Get to the point.

33:38.433 --> 33:42.824
The point is, I'm gonna trade
your sorry ass for her husband and kid.

33:42.913 --> 33:45.711
- I don't think so.
- No? Well...

33:45.793 --> 33:50.230
Then I guess we get to find out
how high your pain threshold really is.

33:51.113 --> 33:53.866
- I thought Max was with you.
- No. Is she all right?

33:53.953 --> 33:55.511
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

33:55.593 --> 33:59.188
- He can't stay here.
- Take it easy, pal. I'm not planning to.

33:59.273 --> 34:02.629
- I'll hook up with you in a coupla days, OK?
- Guys!

34:04.393 --> 34:06.987
What are they doin' here?

34:07.073 --> 34:09.792
- Just a bunch of humans.
- It's Max.

34:09.873 --> 34:12.864
- You know her?
- She's a friend. She's X5.

34:13.393 --> 34:16.304
X5, huh? Not our problem.

34:16.393 --> 34:18.349
Yeah, but you see that guy right there?

34:18.433 --> 34:22.665
He's in charge of huntin' you down,
so I suggest you make it your problem.

34:40.553 --> 34:43.545
- Let's see what you're packin'.
- We're unarmed.

34:43.632 --> 34:46.193
I don't have a whole lot of patience.

34:46.273 --> 34:51.063
I don't think you boys wanna stay
in Terminal City any longer than you have to.

35:01.953 --> 35:04.592
All right. Let's do this.

35:15.193 --> 35:19.903
OK, on three. One, two, three.

35:19.993 --> 35:23.872
- Is my son still alive?
- You won't be if you don't start movin'.

35:42.513 --> 35:43.273
Not another step.

35:43.273 --> 35:44.501
Not another step.

35:45.713 --> 35:47.943
Nice work, Otto.

36:08.753 --> 36:11.267
You guys wanna throw down, go ahead.

36:11.353 --> 36:14.425
But a whole lot of people are gonna get hurt.

36:15.433 --> 36:17.230
This isn't over, 452.

36:20.193 --> 36:22.946
All right, gentlemen.

36:37.073 --> 36:41.191
- Sam, what's going on here?
- I'll explain everything later, OK?

36:43.673 --> 36:46.471
So I guess you really can
take care of yourself.

36:46.553 --> 36:48.544
And me too.

36:56.873 --> 37:00.468
- Score anything?
- Jacked an SUV from some gangster guys

37:00.553 --> 37:02.544
outside a strip club.

37:03.713 --> 37:06.432
- Thanks.
- It's gonna be a long ride to Canada.

37:06.513 --> 37:08.629
She's got some explaining to do.

37:08.713 --> 37:11.307
- I appreciate this.
- I know. Anything for a friend.

37:11.393 --> 37:13.384
Or a clone of a friend.

37:16.913 --> 37:18.904
You're all set.

37:20.633 --> 37:25.184
If you're expecting thanks, forget it. None of
this would've happened if it weren't for you.

37:25.273 --> 37:28.390
- You're right.
- You know, if Manticore hadn't gone down,

37:28.473 --> 37:29.433
you wouldn't even be with them.

37:29.433 --> 37:30.752
You wouldn't even be with them.

37:30.833 --> 37:33.552
You know who took it down.

37:34.873 --> 37:37.068
Not bad.

37:37.153 --> 37:39.223
Good luck.

37:39.953 --> 37:42.342
You too. Come on.

37:48.633 --> 37:50.863
So White really messed up your place, huh?

37:50.953 --> 37:53.228
- Yep.
- I'm sorry.

37:54.633 --> 37:59.866
Got my files out. It's gonna take some pricey
equipment to get Eyes Only up and running.

38:00.193 --> 38:03.230
You're gonna need a good cat burglar.

38:04.433 --> 38:06.469
Thought you were leaving town.

38:08.953 --> 38:12.263
Nah. Got some family stuff to take care of.

38:18.033 --> 38:21.389
Committee calls to the stand
Special Agent Ames White.

38:21.473 --> 38:27.230
Now, Agent White, I'm sure you've been
instructed by counsel and by your superiors

38:27.313 --> 38:29.429
to invoke your Fifth Amendment right.

38:29.513 --> 38:35.383
But I wanna remind you, as an officer of
this committee and as your fellow American,

38:35.473 --> 38:39.102
that all this committee
is interested in is truth.

38:42.153 --> 38:44.621
The truth, sir, is quite simple.

38:44.713 --> 38:50.470
Did parties within our government secretly
divert funds for genetic experiments?

38:52.353 --> 38:53.752
Yes.

38:53.833 --> 38:56.427
Did they allow those transgenics to escape?

38:56.513 --> 38:57.707
Yes.

38:58.393 --> 39:02.750
Did they then choose to withhold that
information from the American people?

39:02.833 --> 39:04.551
Yes.

39:04.633 --> 39:06.783
Are those transgenics dangerous?

39:07.473 --> 39:09.941
Most assuredly, yes.

39:10.313 --> 39:13.623
I cannot in good conscience
continue to be part of this cover-up.

39:13.713 --> 39:17.149
- That, my friends, is a true patriot.
- Transgenics are a great threat

39:17.233 --> 39:20.862
to our national security
and our American way of life.

39:20.953 --> 39:24.070
Make no mistake. This is a war.

39:24.153 --> 39:27.031
A war we cannot afford to lose.

39:27.113 --> 39:29.786
- Hey!
- Bip bip bip, people.

39:29.873 --> 39:34.071
C'mon, these packages
aren't gonna deliver themselves.

39:35.913 --> 39:37.904
You heard her. Get back to work.

39:40.593 --> 39:42.868
What? You got somethin' to say?

39:42.953 --> 39:44.944
- Me? No.
- I'm good.

39:47.713 --> 39:50.181
- Miss me?
- You know it, boo.

39:50.273 --> 39:52.264
You know it.

39:54.313 --> 39:56.349
Simms is gonna want my badge.

39:56.433 --> 40:00.949
Don't worry about Simms. By the time
I'm through, you'll be a national hero,

40:01.033 --> 40:05.424
in a position to eliminate
the transgenics once and for all.

40:05.513 --> 40:08.983
The Conclave will be in touch. Fe'nos tol.

40:09.073 --> 40:11.064
Fe'nos tol.

40:15.753 --> 40:18.313
Wonder if Manticore
cooked up any more of me,

40:18.393 --> 40:20.623
cos one clone is plenty.

40:20.713 --> 40:23.591
Especially when she's got a nasty left hook.

40:23.673 --> 40:25.948
She was right about one thing, though.

40:26.033 --> 40:28.388
Running away isn't the answer.

40:28.473 --> 40:31.510
Cos, as messed up
as everything's gotten lately,

40:31.593 --> 40:33.584
this is home.

41:07.313 --> 41:10.066
