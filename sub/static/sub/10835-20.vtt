WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:03.253
Previously on 90210...

00:03.295 --> 00:04.922
My dad says I have
to live at home.

00:04.964 --> 00:07.090
Stay at my house.
As long as you want.

00:07.132 --> 00:09.092
Hey, Liam, I'm not going
to be your booty call.

00:09.134 --> 00:10.678
GIRL:
Hello, Silver.

00:10.719 --> 00:12.513
Hey. I saw your movie
on YouTube.

00:12.554 --> 00:13.973
I can't go back to school.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.683
I'm enrolling
at St. Clare's.

00:15.724 --> 00:16.976
I just need a fresh start.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.101
You don't have
to give your baby up

00:18.143 --> 00:19.269
if you don't want to.

00:19.311 --> 00:20.771
What are you saying?
We should get married?

00:20.813 --> 00:22.648
Yes. Yes!
Uh, married. Sure.

00:22.690 --> 00:23.816
Yeah, okay.

00:23.858 --> 00:25.192
We're getting married.

00:34.994 --> 00:36.662
Freshly pureed carrots
coming on up.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.121
Oh!

00:38.163 --> 00:39.331
Who's hungry?

00:39.373 --> 00:40.958
I think I know who's hungry.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.334
(in baby voice):
Oh, organic vegetables

00:42.376 --> 00:44.753
coming in for a landing.

00:44.795 --> 00:46.254
(imitating airplane engine)

00:49.591 --> 00:51.468
Open up, Hannah.

00:51.510 --> 00:53.470
Hannah? That's an
odd name for a boy.

00:53.512 --> 00:55.472
Well, she's not
going to be a boy.

00:55.514 --> 00:56.807
Oh, please.
The way you're carrying?

00:56.849 --> 00:59.309
She's a boy.
He's a boy.

00:59.351 --> 01:00.728
I will call him Habib.

01:00.769 --> 01:04.815
Habib? Really?
Yeah.

01:04.857 --> 01:06.692
Do you want him to be
teased mercilessly?

01:06.734 --> 01:09.028
Come on. Kids in Beverly hills
are used to all kinds of names.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.988
Not by kids.
By me.

01:11.030 --> 01:12.364
Habib's a good name.

01:12.406 --> 01:16.368
Very masculine,
yet sensitive.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.704
NAVID:
Which is the kind of kid
he's going to be.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.330
Rugged but soulful;
athletic

01:20.372 --> 01:21.373
but not jocky.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.208
Intelligent but not nerdy.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.252
Oh, and you know what I bet
he's really going to be into?

01:25.293 --> 01:26.587
Chess.

01:26.628 --> 01:28.255
ADRIANNA:
Babies do not play chess.

01:28.296 --> 01:29.924
NAVID:
Oh, if any baby could,
ours could.

01:29.965 --> 01:31.132
I'm telling you,
our little guy

01:31.174 --> 01:32.217
is going to have the best
of everything.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.677
I made this bassinet, you know.

01:33.719 --> 01:35.054
I know and I love it.

01:35.094 --> 01:38.097
But babies do
not play chess.

01:38.139 --> 01:39.433
NAVID:
Well, not at first, I guess.

01:39.474 --> 01:41.226
When he's older.
I'm telling you,

01:41.268 --> 01:43.020
he's going to be a prodigy.

01:43.062 --> 01:44.521
Well, I don't
need a prodigy.

01:44.563 --> 01:46.314
I just want a healthy baby.

01:48.400 --> 01:49.985
(gentle laugh)
Aw...

01:50.027 --> 01:51.361
Come to Mama.

01:51.403 --> 01:53.072
Uh-oh.
We'd better get to school.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.282
Who's going to take
care of Hannah?
My parents.

01:55.323 --> 01:57.325
Hello!

01:57.367 --> 01:59.369
Oh... yeah,

01:59.411 --> 02:00.746
if they're on board.

02:00.788 --> 02:03.916
Of course I'm on board
to raise our grandbaby.

02:03.958 --> 02:05.084
(cooing)

02:05.125 --> 02:07.002
Navid?
Hmm? What?

02:07.044 --> 02:08.211
They don't even know
I'm pregnant.

02:08.252 --> 02:09.378
Yeah, because
you keep avoiding them,

02:09.420 --> 02:11.214
which you can't keep doing.

02:11.256 --> 02:12.883
Because unless you have the
gestation period of an elephant,

02:12.925 --> 02:14.802
the cat is going to come
out of the bag soon enough.

02:14.843 --> 02:16.428
Not to mix
my animal metaphors.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.305
I know that
they need to know.

02:18.346 --> 02:21.558
I just... I thought maybe you'd
want to tell them by yourself,

02:21.600 --> 02:24.103
while I go hide
under a bed.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.646
No, it's not going
to be that bad, I promise.

02:25.687 --> 02:26.814
(groaning)

02:26.855 --> 02:28.065
In fact, I can tell you exactly

02:28.107 --> 02:29.483
how the whole thing
is going to go down.

02:29.524 --> 02:32.569
At first, yeah,
they'll explode with anger.

02:32.611 --> 02:33.779
My mom's going
to start to cry.

02:33.821 --> 02:35.781
(groaning)
Oh, she cries
when she burns dinner.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.407
While my mom's crying,
my dad will rant

02:37.449 --> 02:39.242
about how we never
should have moved to America.

02:39.284 --> 02:40.786
He'll say random things
about, you know,

02:40.828 --> 02:43.455
the dangers of video games
or processed sugar.

02:43.497 --> 02:46.500
He really hates
processed sugar.

02:46.541 --> 02:47.542
And then...
There's more?

02:47.584 --> 02:48.794
Well, then they'll start
to calm down.

02:48.836 --> 02:49.795
My dad will begin
to shake his head.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.505
My mom will start
to sigh repeatedly.

02:51.546 --> 02:53.090
But the worst will be over.

02:53.132 --> 02:54.758
And that's when
I'll bring in the clincher.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.094
I'll suggest, if they don't want
to help take care of the baby,

02:57.136 --> 02:58.762
maybe we'll get a nanny,
and my mom will be like,

02:58.804 --> 03:00.555
"Shirazis don't use nannies!

03:00.597 --> 03:02.057
"Are you crazy?

03:02.099 --> 03:04.267
Family takes care of family."

03:04.309 --> 03:05.978
And then it will be
all hugs and kisses

03:06.020 --> 03:07.104
and halva from there on out.

03:07.146 --> 03:08.522
I'm sorry.

03:08.563 --> 03:10.565
Don't you think they're
going to totally freak

03:10.607 --> 03:12.526
when they find out
you're not...

03:12.567 --> 03:14.153
the biological father?

03:14.193 --> 03:15.821
No. My mom was raised
by her stepdad.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.196
It's her favorite person
in the whole world.

03:17.238 --> 03:19.116
It's not going to matter
to them who the sperm donor is.

03:19.158 --> 03:23.037
I'm going to be Habib's father.

03:23.078 --> 03:25.122
I'm going to be the one
to build his bassinet.

03:25.164 --> 03:26.289
(laughing)

03:26.331 --> 03:28.000
Well, Habib is a
very lucky kid,

03:28.042 --> 03:29.918
despite his
unfortunate name.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.300
What about this?

03:37.342 --> 03:39.970
Are you and Liam
grabbing a drink

03:40.012 --> 03:41.555
or applying
for a second mortgage?

03:41.596 --> 03:43.306
You're right. It's ridiculous.

03:43.348 --> 03:44.641
(groaning)

03:44.683 --> 03:45.851
It's just, tomorrow's
our first official date,

03:45.893 --> 03:47.728
and I want him to take me
seriously, you know?

03:47.769 --> 03:49.188
I really like this guy.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.023
I mean...

03:51.065 --> 03:52.983
he's smart, interesting, deep.

03:53.025 --> 03:54.484
I want him to know
that I have substance, too.

03:54.526 --> 03:56.319
I don't want him to think I'm
just someone he has sex with

03:56.361 --> 03:58.697
in the woods, or in cars,
or in your bed.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.657
What?
Laundry.

04:00.699 --> 04:01.992
Oh, it's a figure of speech.

04:02.034 --> 04:03.869
Maybe I can find something
to wear in here.

04:03.911 --> 04:05.245
So, listen, Naomi,
I know you're

04:05.286 --> 04:06.329
going through
a difficult time...

04:06.371 --> 04:07.581
'Cause my dad's a pervert,

04:07.622 --> 04:09.666
and the newspapers are comparing
him to Clarence Thomas,

04:09.708 --> 04:10.876
whoever that is.

04:10.918 --> 04:11.919
Yeah.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.003
It's been tough.

04:13.045 --> 04:16.005
Yeah, I bet it has.

04:16.048 --> 04:17.173
But are you even

04:17.216 --> 04:18.425
talking to your father,
trying to come up

04:18.466 --> 04:20.719
with a solution
to this whole living situation?

04:20.761 --> 04:22.053
(scoffs)

04:22.096 --> 04:24.347
Yeah. His solution
is that I move back in with him

04:24.389 --> 04:26.016
and play the role of,
"the good daughter,"

04:26.058 --> 04:27.226
and make nice

04:27.267 --> 04:28.727
with his skanky girlfriend.
My solution

04:28.769 --> 04:30.229
is that he take his solution
and shove it up his ass.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.731
The only compromise
we came to is

04:32.773 --> 04:33.857
that I stay here

04:33.899 --> 04:36.568
until the sexual harassment case
blows over

04:36.610 --> 04:38.528
and seriously, thank God you
guys are letting me crash here.

04:38.570 --> 04:39.696
I am so grateful.

04:39.738 --> 04:40.781
You have no idea.

04:40.822 --> 04:43.951
Yeah! Thank you so much, Mom.

04:43.992 --> 04:45.035
You're welcome.

04:45.077 --> 04:46.203
Yeah.

04:46.245 --> 04:47.621
Wait, could you
iron this, por favor?

04:47.662 --> 04:49.039
Uh...

04:49.081 --> 04:50.958
ANNIE:
You are the best.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.292
Really.

04:52.333 --> 04:56.379
Oh, my God,
I'm so mad right now!

04:56.421 --> 04:57.756
Take it easy!

04:57.798 --> 04:59.091
I can't!

04:59.133 --> 05:00.968
He makes me crazy!
Who-who?

05:01.009 --> 05:03.762
Liam!
He canceled our date again.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.097
I swear,

05:05.139 --> 05:06.765
I'm going to rage out right now!

05:06.807 --> 05:08.142
No raging out!

05:08.183 --> 05:09.768
But why did he do it? Why?!

05:09.810 --> 05:11.561
Did he meet someone else?
Or is he sick?

05:11.603 --> 05:14.731
Why don't you just ask him
for an explanation?

05:14.773 --> 05:16.233
Yes! Yes!

05:16.275 --> 05:18.485
Oh, my God! I love
living with you.

05:22.656 --> 05:25.575
Okay. What do you think?

05:25.617 --> 05:26.952
Um...

05:26.994 --> 05:29.579
I think you look like you're
going to Catholic school

05:29.621 --> 05:32.833
Come on, Dixon, doesn't
seeing me in this uniform

05:32.874 --> 05:34.417
make you feel a
little bit better?
Not really.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.503
Don't tell me you have
a Yeshiva fetish.

05:37.671 --> 05:38.755
Okay, I will try

05:38.797 --> 05:40.090
to grow out the little curls

05:40.132 --> 05:42.092
and wear a fur hat
in the summer.

05:42.134 --> 05:43.260
I just think it's
a little extreme.

05:43.302 --> 05:44.928
Wearing fur hats in the summer?
Yeah, I agree.

05:44.970 --> 05:47.764
No, I'm not talking
about fur hats.

05:47.806 --> 05:50.100
I'm talking about
Catholic school.

05:50.142 --> 05:52.102
I mean,
you're not even Catholic.

05:52.144 --> 05:55.480
It's pretty much
like any other school,

05:55.522 --> 05:56.397
with the occasional Mass.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.612
It's the only place
that would take me mid-semester.

06:02.654 --> 06:04.114
You have to understand.

06:04.156 --> 06:06.449
I can't go back
to West Beverly.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.785
I'll always be
"crazy bipolar girl

06:08.827 --> 06:09.953
who made a sex tape."

06:09.995 --> 06:11.163
Silver, that's not true.

06:11.205 --> 06:13.456
Everyone there knows what I did.

06:13.498 --> 06:15.374
I walk in that building,
people are going to stare

06:15.416 --> 06:17.418
and whisper and...

06:17.460 --> 06:19.213
I just can't take that.

06:19.254 --> 06:20.672
I can't.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.050
I need a fresh start.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.551
And I need you to be supportive.

06:26.011 --> 06:28.513
Kelly got on board.
Why can't you?

06:28.555 --> 06:30.557
Because Kelly's still going
to see you every day.

06:30.598 --> 06:31.892
I mean, you won't

06:31.933 --> 06:34.144
come hang out with me
at the Peach Pit anymore.

06:34.186 --> 06:36.813
And you're not going
to be in school. That's all...

06:36.855 --> 06:38.397
You're still going to see me
all the time, I promise.

06:39.691 --> 06:41.735
Can't you try to accept this?
For me?

06:44.529 --> 06:47.699
Does the outfit come
with the knee socks?

06:47.741 --> 06:49.576
(giggling)

06:57.542 --> 07:00.212
SISTER MARY ELIZABETH:
I'd like you all to welcome
a new student

07:00.254 --> 07:01.462
who will be joining
our homeroom.

07:01.504 --> 07:02.672
Please introduce yourself.

07:02.714 --> 07:04.465
Hi, I'm, I'm Erin.

07:04.507 --> 07:06.343
Erin Silver.

07:06.385 --> 07:08.053
And what brings you
to St. Clare's, Erin?

07:08.095 --> 07:10.097
Um...

07:10.138 --> 07:11.181
Well...

07:11.223 --> 07:13.433
Uh, the academics mostly.

07:13.474 --> 07:14.851
I-I hear
they're really good here.

07:14.893 --> 07:18.021
And I like what you have
to offer in terms of,

07:18.063 --> 07:20.023
you know, God.

07:20.065 --> 07:22.025
And morals.
I'm really excited

07:22.067 --> 07:24.527
to be around people
with good morals.

07:24.569 --> 07:26.029
And that's pretty much it.

07:26.071 --> 07:27.530
Well, we're pleased
to have you.

07:27.572 --> 07:29.699
Tell me, are you familiar
with the catechism?

07:29.741 --> 07:34.371
Oh... um, I'm...
No, not really.

07:34.413 --> 07:35.372
Not a problem.

07:35.414 --> 07:37.082
Why don't you have
a seat, Erin?

07:38.583 --> 07:40.168
Yeah.

07:40.210 --> 07:41.253
Would anyone like

07:41.295 --> 07:43.422
to help Erin
brush up on the...

07:43.463 --> 07:45.382
(laughing):
Okay, Angela.

07:45.424 --> 07:48.051
But remember, not everyone
is as pious as you are.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.928
So go easy on her, okay?

07:49.970 --> 07:51.221
I will, Sister Mary Elizabeth.

07:51.263 --> 07:52.389
All right.

07:52.431 --> 07:54.975
Let's begin
with our morning offering.

07:55.016 --> 07:58.812
ALL:
Oh, Jesus, through the
immaculate heart of Mary,

07:58.853 --> 08:02.816
I offer you my prayers,
works, joys,

08:02.857 --> 08:04.276
and sufferings of this day.

08:04.318 --> 08:05.444
ADRIANNA:
What the hell?

08:05.485 --> 08:07.404
You okay?

08:07.446 --> 08:08.738
Dahlias are
out of season.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.115
No!

08:10.157 --> 08:12.784
I'm having dinner with
Navid's parents tonight,

08:12.826 --> 08:14.244
and dahlias are his
mom's favorite flower.

08:14.286 --> 08:15.578
But the only florist
that has them right now

08:15.620 --> 08:16.955
is up in Santa Barbara.

08:16.997 --> 08:20.167
Do you think I should ditch
school and drive up there?

08:20.208 --> 08:22.252
Um, I'm going to go with no.

08:22.294 --> 08:24.421
What are you nervous about?

08:24.463 --> 08:25.880
His parents are
in love with you.

08:25.922 --> 08:28.091
Yeah, but...
But what?

08:28.133 --> 08:30.093
Okay.

08:30.135 --> 08:31.428
I was going to wait
until tomorrow

08:31.470 --> 08:32.804
to tell you this.

08:32.846 --> 08:36.640
But, well, um...

08:36.683 --> 08:38.643
Navid and I are getting married.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.770
What the hell?

08:40.812 --> 08:44.274
Okay. Not exactly the reaction
I was hoping for.

08:44.316 --> 08:46.776
I-I'm sorry. I'm just..

08:46.818 --> 08:47.944
Wh-Why?

08:47.986 --> 08:49.488
Well, we're going
to keep the baby.

08:49.529 --> 08:50.947
You're going to keep the baby?

08:50.989 --> 08:52.157
Yeah, I am.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.034
Navid's going to
raise it with me,

08:54.075 --> 08:55.702
which is why we're
getting married.

08:55.743 --> 08:58.330
I don't understand why you have
to get married to keep the baby.

08:58.372 --> 09:00.332
Or why you want to keep
the baby, for that matter.

09:00.374 --> 09:02.501
I'm keeping the baby
because it's my baby.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.127
I want to raise it,

09:04.169 --> 09:06.046
and I didn't think it was
possible before, but now,

09:06.087 --> 09:07.714
because of Navid, it is.

09:07.755 --> 09:11.009
I want to be with him
for the rest of my life.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.470
And he wants to
do this with me.

09:13.512 --> 09:15.889
He's so amazing.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.015
Yeah, he'd have
to be pretty amazing

09:17.057 --> 09:18.433
to be okay
with raising Ty's baby.

09:21.769 --> 09:23.688
Oh, he still thinks
the dad's some guy from rehab?

09:23.730 --> 09:25.648
Ade!
You know, it didn't
seem that important

09:25.690 --> 09:27.067
when I was set on adoption.

09:27.108 --> 09:28.485
If you can't
be honest with Navid,

09:28.527 --> 09:29.986
do you really think
you should be marrying him?

09:30.028 --> 09:31.154
It's complicated.

09:31.196 --> 09:32.406
It's not.

09:33.865 --> 09:35.825
You're afraid
if you tell him the truth,

09:35.867 --> 09:38.495
your perfect little
marriage fantasy will end.

09:38.537 --> 09:40.580
Look, don't judge me.

09:42.707 --> 09:45.752
If you love him,
you need to tell him.

10:03.811 --> 10:04.771
(inhales deeply)

10:04.812 --> 10:06.314
What's that I smell?

10:06.356 --> 10:07.566
Are we, perchance,
having salmon for dinner?

10:07.607 --> 10:09.609
We are.
Wow!

10:09.650 --> 10:11.027
Three times this week.

10:11.069 --> 10:15.073
You guys take that omega-3
propaganda seriously, huh?

10:15.115 --> 10:18.493
No, Mom makes salmon because
she knows how much I like it.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.203
Maybe you should think about
what the other family members

10:20.245 --> 10:21.580
might want.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.290
(coughing):
Kobe beef.

10:23.331 --> 10:25.083
(laughing):
Just kidding. Filet's fine.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.126
So, how was your first day

10:26.167 --> 10:27.168
without Silver?

10:27.210 --> 10:29.003
Well, it...
Oh, poor Dixie.

10:29.045 --> 10:30.171
He's bumming hardcore.

10:30.213 --> 10:32.382
Long-distance
relationships blow.

10:32.424 --> 10:33.883
Stop calling me Dixie.

10:33.925 --> 10:34.968
And, uh,

10:35.009 --> 10:36.636
yeah, they do blow.

10:36.677 --> 10:38.638
You're not in a long-distance
relationship, Dixie... Dixon.

10:38.679 --> 10:40.140
Silver's just going
to another school.

10:40.181 --> 10:42.183
You'll have to put in a little
extra effort.

10:42.225 --> 10:43.477
Yeah, I guess you're right.

10:43.518 --> 10:44.936
Got a feeling
it's not gonna work.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.355
Hey, there, easy on
the pepper, Mama.

10:47.397 --> 10:50.191
So what do you kids have planned
for the rest of the day?

10:50.233 --> 10:51.943
You're not gonna stand around
watching me cook, are you?

10:51.985 --> 10:53.111
I'm going to the gyno.

10:53.153 --> 10:53.945
Oh!

10:53.987 --> 10:55.447
Aw, geez, Naomi!

10:55.489 --> 10:57.240
What? It's time for my pap.

10:57.282 --> 10:58.408
Oh, hey, Annie,

10:58.450 --> 10:59.700
you know about HPV, right?

10:59.742 --> 11:00.994
Yeah.
'Cause it doesn't

11:01.035 --> 11:02.329
matter if you have
your little V card,

11:02.370 --> 11:04.539
all it takes is some
genital contact...
Naomi!

11:04.581 --> 11:05.499
Please?

11:05.540 --> 11:06.791
What?

11:06.833 --> 11:07.792
Ask me how
I know that.

11:07.834 --> 11:08.668
It's okay, really.

11:08.709 --> 11:09.669
Super hot gyno.

11:09.710 --> 11:11.630
He talks, I listen.

11:11.671 --> 11:12.964
Anyways, I'm off.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.341
Have fun.

11:14.382 --> 11:15.467
Oh, believe me, I will.

11:16.968 --> 11:21.055
So, salmon, huh?
Yum.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.681
Dixon, where are you going?

11:22.723 --> 11:26.520
Um, not really hungry anymore.

11:26.561 --> 11:29.022
Yeah.

11:29.063 --> 11:30.857
(school bell ringing)

11:30.898 --> 11:34.110
The catechism is arranged
into four principle parts.

11:34.152 --> 11:35.778
I'm assuming you know
The Lord's Prayer?

11:37.238 --> 11:38.948
Not a problem.
We'll go over it.

11:38.990 --> 11:40.200
Cool. Thanks.

11:40.241 --> 11:41.660
Of course. My pleasure.

11:41.700 --> 11:43.203
So, you went
to West Beverly, right?

11:43.244 --> 11:44.204
Mm-hmm.

11:44.245 --> 11:45.622
Well, I know what

11:45.664 --> 11:47.081
you meant by wanting
to be around people

11:47.123 --> 11:48.249
with better morals.

11:48.291 --> 11:50.709
I don't know how you
survived West Beverly.

11:50.751 --> 11:52.879
It's like Sodom and Gomorrah
over there

11:52.920 --> 11:54.673
with... with all the sex

11:54.713 --> 11:57.008
and drugs, so much
money and excess,

11:57.050 --> 11:59.010
and no moral compass.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.888
Sometimes I'll see those
West Beverly kids at the movies,

12:01.929 --> 12:03.181
and they'll buy a medium soda

12:03.223 --> 12:05.099
and then just keep going back
for refills.

12:05.141 --> 12:06.893
And it's not like
they got the jumbo

12:06.934 --> 12:08.853
which comes with
free refills, you know?

12:08.895 --> 12:10.397
And they could totally afford
the jumbo.

12:10.438 --> 12:13.483
Yeah, um... I mean,
that's why I left.

12:13.525 --> 12:15.151
Things like
the soda stuff.

12:15.193 --> 12:17.987
Should we get back
to the catechism, though?

12:18.029 --> 12:20.031
'Cause I just have
so much to learn.
Of course.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.033
Now, I know
this can be overwhelming.

12:22.075 --> 12:25.453
Try not to think
of it as work, okay?

12:25.495 --> 12:26.787
Think of religion as

12:26.829 --> 12:31.000
like... the best extracurricular
activity ever.

12:31.042 --> 12:32.669
Okay.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.845
Decided to do a little shopping
after the gyno.

12:42.887 --> 12:44.389
What do you think?

12:44.431 --> 12:47.183
Oh! So cute!

12:47.225 --> 12:48.476
Good, it's for you.
Try it on.

12:48.518 --> 12:49.894
What? Why?

12:49.936 --> 12:52.397
So I can see if it fits.
Go. Shoo.

12:52.439 --> 12:53.565
Yeah, I know,

12:53.607 --> 12:54.733
but why did you
buy me a gift?

12:54.773 --> 12:55.942
To thank you.

12:55.983 --> 12:58.069
That advice you gave me
about confronting Liam,

12:58.111 --> 12:59.320
ask him why he canceled?

12:59.362 --> 13:01.448
Genius. Ooh.

13:01.489 --> 13:02.657
He told me the reason.

13:02.699 --> 13:04.117
We came up with a solution,

13:04.158 --> 13:05.784
and voilà, we're back on
for tonight.

13:05.826 --> 13:07.912
And so why did
he cancel?

13:07.954 --> 13:10.164
Oh, his cousin came up
from San Diego.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.125
He had to hang with him.
Does it fit?

13:12.166 --> 13:14.168
Perfectly. I just need
help with the zipper.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.837
Wow, it looks amazing
on you.

13:16.879 --> 13:18.214
Try these on
with it.

13:18.256 --> 13:20.508
You got me shoes, too?
What, Naomi?

13:20.550 --> 13:21.676
Put them on.

13:21.718 --> 13:22.927
(groans)

13:22.969 --> 13:26.681
So are you gonna hang out
with this cousin, too?

13:26.723 --> 13:28.642
Yeah, we're gonna do
the double date thing.

13:28.683 --> 13:29.850
With who?

13:29.892 --> 13:32.437
Well, seeing as you're
already dressed...

13:32.479 --> 13:35.148
Naomi, I hate blind dates.

13:35.189 --> 13:37.275
Please?! You know how important
tonight is to me.

13:38.568 --> 13:39.860
Okay, I'll go.

13:44.949 --> 13:46.367
(laughter)

13:46.409 --> 13:48.703
SILVER:
Uh, hey, so thanks again
for everything today,

13:48.745 --> 13:50.037
and I'll see you tomorrow.

13:50.079 --> 13:51.456
All right, have
a good night.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.582
You, too.

13:54.417 --> 13:56.377
Hey, what are you
doing here?

13:56.419 --> 13:58.045
I called Kels
and I told her

13:58.087 --> 13:59.673
I was gonna pick you up.
so, uh...

13:59.714 --> 14:01.424
Okay, well, um, let's,
let's go, all right?

14:07.597 --> 14:09.724
Everything all right?

14:09.766 --> 14:10.975
You shouldn't have come.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.560
I'm trying to keep
a low profile.

14:12.602 --> 14:14.853
I wasn't exactly
making a scene.

14:14.895 --> 14:16.773
I know, I just,
I don't need people here

14:16.815 --> 14:18.065
knowing things about me.

14:18.107 --> 14:21.027
I told you, I'm trying
to make a fresh start.

14:21.068 --> 14:23.070
So that means you can't
have a boyfriend?

14:23.112 --> 14:26.949
No... I just... I want
to keep my personal life

14:26.991 --> 14:28.993
separate from school, okay?

14:29.035 --> 14:30.244
So what does that
mean for us?

14:30.286 --> 14:32.747
I mean, you don't want
to go anywhere

14:32.789 --> 14:34.123
we might run into anyone

14:34.165 --> 14:37.293
from West Bev; you don't
want me near St. Clare's;

14:37.335 --> 14:39.671
so where does that
leave us to hang out?

14:39.713 --> 14:43.591
I don't know--
my house, your house.

14:43.633 --> 14:45.593
Are you serious?

14:45.635 --> 14:49.930
Look, this is just what I need
right now, okay?

14:49.972 --> 14:51.725
Yeah.

14:53.643 --> 14:54.602
Hello, Navid.

14:54.644 --> 14:55.687
Thanks, Jackie.

14:55.729 --> 14:59.106
It's gonna be okay.

14:59.148 --> 15:00.775
(speaking Farsi)

15:00.817 --> 15:02.360
Hi, guys.

15:02.402 --> 15:05.780
Hey, you two!
Hello!

15:05.822 --> 15:07.448
Hello.
Hi.

15:08.742 --> 15:10.951
Adrianna,
we are so glad

15:10.993 --> 15:12.245
you're having dinner
with us tonight.

15:12.286 --> 15:14.539
We keep telling Navid
to bring you by,

15:14.581 --> 15:17.458
but you know how he is,
so private.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.543
(chuckles)

15:18.585 --> 15:20.712
Well, thank you so much
for having me.

15:20.754 --> 15:23.256
These are for you.

15:23.297 --> 15:25.132
Oh, I love peonies.

15:25.174 --> 15:27.301
That's so thoughtful.
Thank you.

15:27.343 --> 15:29.596
(quietly):
It'll be fine.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.639
So, how have you been?

15:31.681 --> 15:34.517
Well, um...

15:50.533 --> 15:51.701
This is an outrage.
This is just outrageous.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.661
Look, I know, I know
this is a shock,

15:53.703 --> 15:56.122
uh, but we're
in love, and, um,

15:56.163 --> 15:57.123
we're getting married.

15:57.164 --> 15:59.208
Married?!

15:59.250 --> 16:00.543
16 and you're having a baby?!

16:00.585 --> 16:01.711
This is an outrage!

16:01.753 --> 16:03.797
(speaking Farsi)
FATHER:
I knew it!

16:03.838 --> 16:05.381
I try to be a good mother!
I tried my best!

16:05.423 --> 16:06.591
FATHER:
I knew we shouldn't
have moved to America!

16:06.633 --> 16:07.592
I knew it was a mistake!

16:07.634 --> 16:09.302
What did I do wrong?!
Mom, Dad,

16:09.343 --> 16:10.887
we came to you
because we have a plan,

16:10.929 --> 16:11.930
and we want you
to be a part of it.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.013
You have a plan?

16:13.055 --> 16:13.932
What kind of plan

16:13.973 --> 16:15.850
could you possibly have?!

16:15.892 --> 16:18.519
We thought we could live
in the guest house.

16:18.561 --> 16:21.648
We still want to
finish high school
and go to college.

16:21.689 --> 16:27.361
Of course, we'll, we'll maybe
have to hire some help.

16:27.403 --> 16:28.738
Maybe we'll get a nanny?

16:28.780 --> 16:30.949
Our family
doesn't use nannies!

16:30.990 --> 16:32.951
(speaks Farsi)
Are you nuts in the head?!

16:32.992 --> 16:34.160
(speaks Farsi)

16:36.078 --> 16:38.832
Your cousin Ravi will watch
the baby two days a week.

16:38.873 --> 16:40.917
I'll take care
of the others.

16:40.959 --> 16:44.629
Family takes care
of family.

16:44.671 --> 16:45.755
Thanks, Mom.

16:45.797 --> 16:47.298
What did you expect?

16:47.340 --> 16:49.383
This baby's blood.

16:52.219 --> 16:54.764
Uh, just so you know--
not that this matters--

16:54.806 --> 16:58.977
but, um, the baby isn't, you
know, technically your blood.

17:01.354 --> 17:02.229
What-what do you mean?

17:02.271 --> 17:03.356
What is "technical" here?

17:03.397 --> 17:05.692
Just that it's not my baby

17:05.733 --> 17:07.777
biologically, but you know,
I don't even care, so...

17:07.819 --> 17:09.278
You mean
you didn't get her pregnant?

17:09.319 --> 17:10.404
Well, no, not technically.

17:10.445 --> 17:11.614
Um, but that's
not the point.

17:11.656 --> 17:12.906
The father's out
of the picture

17:12.949 --> 17:14.450
and I'm here,

17:14.492 --> 17:15.535
so I want to raise
the baby as if...

17:15.576 --> 17:19.288
(shouting in Farsi)

17:19.329 --> 17:20.748
What are you
talking about?!

17:20.790 --> 17:21.624
Mom was raised
by her stepdad!

17:21.665 --> 17:23.501
(speaking Farsi)

17:24.627 --> 17:26.127
(speaking Farsi)

17:27.380 --> 17:28.464
End of story.

17:28.506 --> 17:29.507
But Dad, you don't...

17:29.549 --> 17:30.257
End of story!

17:36.597 --> 17:39.141
♪ ♪

17:41.769 --> 17:43.938
Oh! Hey, you two.

17:43.980 --> 17:44.939
I'm Naomi.

17:44.981 --> 17:47.191
You probably heard a lot
about me.

17:47.233 --> 17:48.275
This is Annie.

17:48.317 --> 17:49.276
Annie, this is Liam.

17:49.318 --> 17:51.029
I'm Bru-Dog. What up?

17:51.070 --> 17:52.238
Sorry?

17:52.279 --> 17:53.447
Bru-Dog.

17:53.489 --> 17:54.949
Old surf name
that stuck.

17:54.991 --> 17:56.158
Oh.

17:56.200 --> 17:59.245
And you are a hottie, Annie-dog.

17:59.286 --> 18:00.413
(barks, howls)

18:00.454 --> 18:02.498
(uncomfortable laugh)

18:02.540 --> 18:04.250
So, this is where you woo
the ladies.

18:04.291 --> 18:05.793
Don't do much wooing...

18:05.835 --> 18:08.462
unless the ladies insist
on being wooed.

18:08.504 --> 18:09.756
(chuckles)

18:09.797 --> 18:11.340
Well, it's a cute place.

18:11.382 --> 18:12.508
Two-dollar beers.

18:12.550 --> 18:13.968
What's better than that?

18:14.010 --> 18:15.011
One-dollar beers.

18:15.053 --> 18:16.804
(laughs)

18:17.931 --> 18:20.224
So, how was your day?
Not bad.

18:22.560 --> 18:26.480
You know, I was
actually thinking
about buying a new car.

18:26.522 --> 18:27.690
Maybe you could advise me.

18:27.732 --> 18:29.233
Didn't you just
get a new car?

18:29.275 --> 18:31.277
Yeah.

18:32.570 --> 18:35.573
So, what kind of car
were you thinking?

18:35.615 --> 18:37.324
I want a hybrid.

18:38.576 --> 18:40.536
I'm pretty pro-environment.

18:40.578 --> 18:42.747
Maybe you could
get a bike, then.

18:44.331 --> 18:45.541
Are you kidding?

18:45.583 --> 18:46.918
I can't tell
if you're kidding.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.168
I'm kidding.

18:48.210 --> 18:49.336
(laughs)

18:49.378 --> 18:51.505
Right, yeah, funny.
Me on a bike.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.507
Ah, Nancy Sutley
would be into it.

18:53.549 --> 18:55.509
Totally, yeah, I know.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.011
You know what?
I am going to run

18:57.053 --> 18:58.554
to the little
girls' room.

18:58.596 --> 19:00.723
Remind me to give you
my Nancy Sutley story

19:00.765 --> 19:01.808
when I get back.

19:03.434 --> 19:04.435
Another one coming up.

19:06.062 --> 19:07.438
Ah.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.399
You got someplace to be?

19:10.441 --> 19:12.359
Oh... Oh, no.

19:12.401 --> 19:14.278
This is fun.

19:18.074 --> 19:19.408
You don't like me, do you?

19:19.450 --> 19:21.911
Oh, no, I like you just fine.
Don't lie.

19:21.953 --> 19:26.124
Honestly, people who
grunt one-word answers

19:26.165 --> 19:27.625
aren't really
my cup of tea.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.168
But whatever floats your boat.

19:31.921 --> 19:34.674
Okay, look,
I have a confession.

19:34.715 --> 19:38.886
I'm pretty shy around strangers
because, when I was a kid,

19:38.928 --> 19:40.220
we moved around a lot.

19:40.262 --> 19:41.889
I was always meeting new people,

19:41.931 --> 19:47.311
and they would mock me and...

19:47.353 --> 19:49.313
make me feel insecure.

19:49.355 --> 19:52.191
I understand.

19:52.232 --> 19:54.861
I am probably bringing
my own baggage to this.

19:54.902 --> 19:57.279
See, I once dated this
guy named Carl-Dog,

19:57.321 --> 19:59.866
and he had this cousin who
was a real ass, you know?

19:59.907 --> 20:02.869
He would try to screw
with people and make
them feel uncomfortable.

20:02.910 --> 20:05.163
I guess it was just
to make himself feel better.

20:05.204 --> 20:09.750
Really quite pitiful and
very traumatic for me.

20:09.792 --> 20:11.002
(laughs)

20:11.044 --> 20:12.586
NAOMI:
Well, I'm back.

20:12.628 --> 20:14.296
What were we
talking about?

20:14.338 --> 20:16.007
Oh, yeah, Nancy Sutley.

20:16.049 --> 20:17.800
Good choice for Obama.
She's such an expert

20:17.842 --> 20:19.135
on California's water
and air problems.

20:19.177 --> 20:20.594
Good point.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.014
Hey, look, sorry

20:23.056 --> 20:24.598
I was being short earlier.

20:24.640 --> 20:27.935
I was just getting my bearings.

20:27.977 --> 20:28.936
So, how was your day?

20:28.978 --> 20:31.689
Good. Not bad.

20:31.731 --> 20:34.067
I mean, I was completely
consumed with this novel.

20:34.108 --> 20:35.317
I was almost late
coming here.

20:35.359 --> 20:37.653
I just threw on whatever
and dashed out the door.

20:37.695 --> 20:40.198
Well, "whatever"
looks good on you.

20:44.827 --> 20:47.538
Brewskis from the Bru-Dog.

20:47.580 --> 20:48.789
(barks, howls)

20:53.419 --> 20:55.337
NAVID:
They're gonna come around.

20:55.379 --> 20:56.463
I don't know.

20:56.505 --> 20:58.799
They will.
They have to.

21:05.806 --> 21:10.477
I... had... so much fun
with you today.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.438
BRU-DOG: And next, I'm
gonna hit Oaxaca.

21:12.479 --> 21:14.023
They're running rad
double overheads

21:14.065 --> 21:17.568
with barrels big enough
to drive a truck through.

21:17.610 --> 21:18.986
That's... that's just rad.

21:19.028 --> 21:20.071
Naomi, time to go home.

21:20.113 --> 21:21.239
Right.

21:24.742 --> 21:26.577
Heel, boy.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.328
Later.

21:28.370 --> 21:30.497
Bye, guys.

21:31.791 --> 21:35.044
Hey, so, uh...
you were right.

21:35.086 --> 21:36.712
I was being a jerk earlier.

21:36.754 --> 21:38.131
Mm, not gonna argue.

21:38.172 --> 21:39.840
Come on.

21:39.882 --> 21:41.425
Can't you give me
another shot?

21:43.177 --> 21:46.097
Fine. I will give you
another shot.

21:46.139 --> 21:48.266
Over dinner next week?

21:48.307 --> 21:49.475
Just the two of us.

21:54.855 --> 21:56.107
(sighs)

21:56.149 --> 21:58.484
You cannot marry Adrianna
and raise the child.

21:58.525 --> 21:59.902
Not in our guest house,

21:59.944 --> 22:01.279
not with our support.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.780
That is so hypocritical.

22:02.822 --> 22:05.116
Our family is full of step-kids.

22:05.158 --> 22:06.742
Honey, you're 16.

22:06.784 --> 22:08.327
I know the timing's
not perfect...

22:08.368 --> 22:10.454
Navid, it's not up
for discussion.

22:10.496 --> 22:11.538
Our decision is final.

22:15.209 --> 22:17.837
This doesn't mean that
your relationship will end.

22:17.878 --> 22:20.006
You can still
date Adrianna.

22:20.047 --> 22:21.632
Just because you're
not getting married,

22:21.674 --> 22:23.467
doesn't mean that
you'll break up.

22:25.303 --> 22:26.553
I know this is hard.

22:28.306 --> 22:30.850
Your heart's in
the right place, Navid.

22:32.143 --> 22:33.393
Adrianna will understand.

22:35.479 --> 22:37.815
NAOMI:
I'm just saying that if
you end up with Bru-Dog,

22:37.857 --> 22:40.526
and I end up with Liam,
we'll be cousins-in-law.

22:40.567 --> 22:42.778
I am not ending up
with Bru-Dog.

22:42.820 --> 22:44.697
You never know, Annie-dog.

22:44.738 --> 22:45.865
(howling)

22:45.906 --> 22:47.449
You know, I'm
beginning to think

22:47.491 --> 22:49.202
that Liam is really
taking me seriously.

22:49.243 --> 22:51.162
Going on an actual date

22:51.204 --> 22:52.830
is a really big step forward
in our relationship.

22:52.872 --> 22:58.127
Um, look, uh, I have
to tell you something,

22:58.169 --> 23:00.213
and I know that it's
really going to upset you,

23:00.254 --> 23:04.050
but we said that we would be
honest with each other, so...

23:04.091 --> 23:05.843
Liam asked me out.

23:07.385 --> 23:09.305
What?

23:09.347 --> 23:11.640
Yeah, um, when we
were saying good-bye.

23:11.682 --> 23:13.226
It came completely
out of the blue.

23:14.727 --> 23:17.521
Well, you must
have misunderstood.

23:17.563 --> 23:19.857
Yeah, but I didn't.

23:19.899 --> 23:22.985
What did you say?

23:23.027 --> 23:24.486
Nothing.
I-I just left.

23:24.528 --> 23:26.239
I would never do that to you.

23:26.280 --> 23:28.157
Not never.

23:28.199 --> 23:30.326
Never again.

23:30.368 --> 23:32.161
The guy's a jerk, Naomi.

23:32.203 --> 23:33.746
Well, thank you
for telling me.

23:33.787 --> 23:34.830
I appreciate it.

23:34.872 --> 23:36.999
I'm sorry.

23:37.041 --> 23:38.667
I know how much you like him.

23:38.709 --> 23:40.502
Yeah.

23:40.544 --> 23:41.628
It happens.

23:43.047 --> 23:45.925
Can I just get a little
privacy tonight?

23:45.966 --> 23:48.261
Yeah, sure, of course.

23:48.302 --> 23:50.679
I'll find somewhere
else to sleep.

23:50.721 --> 23:53.599
Like my grandma's bed
or something.

23:55.184 --> 23:56.394
Thanks.

24:07.487 --> 24:08.781
(sighs)

24:14.245 --> 24:15.704
Hey, stop that.
I'm doing the dishes

24:15.746 --> 24:17.039
and you're just making
them dirty again.

24:17.081 --> 24:18.374
How am I supposed to eat?

24:18.416 --> 24:19.541
DEBBIE:
You're not.
We already ate.

24:19.583 --> 24:21.543
Guys, can we keep it down
a little bit?

24:21.585 --> 24:22.920
I'm doing
my homework over here.

24:22.962 --> 24:24.713
Why don't you go
upstairs and work
in your room?

24:24.755 --> 24:26.173
Naomi's upstairs.

24:26.215 --> 24:28.634
She'll try to teach me
how to French-braid her hair...

24:28.675 --> 24:29.885
No, no, sorry.

24:29.927 --> 24:32.388
ANNIE:
Hey, Mom, do we have
any extra blankets?

24:32.430 --> 24:34.140
Grandma's room is drafty,
and I'm sleeping there tonight.

24:34.181 --> 24:36.267
Why?
It's no big deal.

24:36.309 --> 24:37.810
Naomi just had
a really tough night,

24:37.851 --> 24:39.061
and she needs some privacy.

24:39.103 --> 24:41.063
Annie...

24:41.105 --> 24:42.982
What? I said
it was no big deal.

24:43.023 --> 24:44.984
Look, sweetheart, we know
you want to help her out.

24:45.025 --> 24:46.193
Yeah, I-I do.

24:46.235 --> 24:47.778
She's going through
a really hard time.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.571
HARRY:
And we're sympathetic.

24:49.613 --> 24:52.116
But her living
here-- just not a
long-term solution.

24:52.158 --> 24:53.033
Amen!

24:54.034 --> 24:55.702
What? What?

24:56.870 --> 24:58.496
You remember those
jeans of mine

24:58.538 --> 24:59.915
that she didn't like?

24:59.957 --> 25:01.292
She cut them up.

25:01.334 --> 25:02.500
Into a
million pieces.

25:02.542 --> 25:04.211
That's not
normal behavior.

25:04.253 --> 25:05.254
Yeah, well, she
probably thought

25:05.296 --> 25:06.504
that she was doing
you a favor.

25:06.546 --> 25:08.424
She threw away my frozen salmon

25:08.466 --> 25:09.425
and filled the fridge
with Kobe beef.

25:09.467 --> 25:11.844
So let's try the Kobe,

25:11.885 --> 25:13.304
see what all
the fuss is about.

25:13.346 --> 25:15.014
What about the whole "Principal
Boxer-shorts" nickname?

25:15.055 --> 25:16.765
You should have
worn a robe!

25:16.807 --> 25:17.766
In my own bedroom?

25:17.808 --> 25:19.435
She was looking
for toothpaste.

25:19.477 --> 25:20.769
Come on, you guys,
where is your compassion?

25:20.811 --> 25:21.770
She has nowhere else
to go.

25:21.812 --> 25:23.772
DEBBIE:
I know that, honey.

25:23.814 --> 25:27.109
And we're not saying we're going
to kick her out right away.
We're not?

25:27.151 --> 25:28.444
DEBBIE:
No, but we have
to figure out

25:28.486 --> 25:30.654
a solution for her
sake as well as ours.
Mm.

25:30.696 --> 25:33.073
Okay.

25:34.325 --> 25:36.118
So when is she leaving?

25:36.160 --> 25:38.037
Shut it, Dixie.

25:45.543 --> 25:46.753
(school bell ringing)

25:46.795 --> 25:49.756
Liam, did you do it?
Did you ask Annie out?

25:49.798 --> 25:51.800
Yeah, I did.

25:51.842 --> 25:53.302
What were you thinking?

25:53.344 --> 25:55.429
She's my friend.
She'd never go
out with you.

25:55.471 --> 25:58.015
Look, that's who
I am, Naomi.

25:58.057 --> 25:59.975
A huge douche bag?
Basically.

26:00.017 --> 26:02.061
I don't do the whole
boyfriend thing.

26:02.102 --> 26:03.896
Which is why you
should get out now.

26:07.024 --> 26:08.442
Oh.

26:08.484 --> 26:10.986
(chuckles)
What?

26:11.028 --> 26:12.154
Nothing. Um...

26:12.196 --> 26:14.114
Why don't you let me
take care of myself.

26:15.491 --> 26:17.993
Maybe I have a little thing
for jerks.

26:25.209 --> 26:26.877
Hey, Erin.
Hey.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.837
It's funny-- you looked
familiar to me yesterday,

26:28.879 --> 26:30.464
but I couldn't
quite place you.

26:30.506 --> 26:33.467
And then, when I saw you
with your boyfriend,

26:33.509 --> 26:34.592
it all came together.

26:34.634 --> 26:35.928
You're the whore
from the video.

26:38.180 --> 26:40.516
Oh, no, please, don't
take any offense to that.

26:40.558 --> 26:43.519
I didn't mean it in a
derogatory way at all.

26:43.561 --> 26:46.522
You know, some people think
that Mary Magdalene was a whore,

26:46.564 --> 26:50.401
and she was one of
Jesus' best friends.

26:50.443 --> 26:52.736
People can repent, Erin;
they can.

26:52.778 --> 26:54.321
Okay.

26:54.363 --> 26:55.655
Well... thanks.

26:55.697 --> 26:57.741
You know, I was
so shocked

26:57.783 --> 27:00.160
when someone forwarded
me the video last month.

27:00.202 --> 27:01.870
You'd think Catholic
school people

27:01.912 --> 27:03.372
would be above
that sort of thing,

27:03.414 --> 27:04.831
but they're always
forwarding me things--

27:04.873 --> 27:06.166
just trying to get my goat.

27:06.208 --> 27:09.044
Of course, I turned it off

27:09.086 --> 27:11.547
when you and your boyfriend
began to fornicate.

27:11.589 --> 27:13.340
Erin...

27:13.382 --> 27:19.012
why did you really
come to Catholic school?

27:19.054 --> 27:20.889
Well...

27:20.931 --> 27:24.226
I made that video
during a difficult period,

27:24.268 --> 27:28.021
and afterwards,
I just wanted a fresh start.

27:28.063 --> 27:30.566
That's totally
understandable.

27:30.608 --> 27:31.942
Thank you.

27:33.777 --> 27:36.863
And now I know why
God brought us together.

27:36.905 --> 27:38.865
I am going to help you
save your soul.

27:38.907 --> 27:41.619
First step:
you have to tell everyone

27:41.659 --> 27:43.496
about your checkered past.

27:43.537 --> 27:44.580
Okay, yeah,
actually, that's...

27:44.622 --> 27:45.623
I really
would rather not.

27:45.663 --> 27:47.082
I know
you don't want to,

27:47.124 --> 27:49.918
but I guarantee
you'll feel better
if you come clean.

27:49.960 --> 27:52.921
Pretending to be someone
that you're not--

27:52.963 --> 27:54.714
it's basically lying.

27:54.756 --> 27:57.426
And God knows, because
God is everywhere.

27:57.468 --> 28:00.429
Okay, well, I'll
think about it.

28:00.471 --> 28:03.098
Lies separate us from
our relationship with God.

28:03.140 --> 28:04.517
And, Erin, I care about you.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.061
You know what?

28:09.980 --> 28:11.315
I'm going to fast.

28:11.357 --> 28:12.774
What?

28:12.816 --> 28:13.817
I won't eat.

28:13.859 --> 28:16.111
And I will pray every
minute of every day

28:16.153 --> 28:17.946
until you come
out of hiding

28:17.988 --> 28:19.990
and admit who you are
and what you've done.

28:20.032 --> 28:22.117
Okay, that-that is a
little bit extreme.

28:22.159 --> 28:23.452
I know it is,

28:23.494 --> 28:25.871
and the nuns, they may
say I'm overzealous,

28:25.912 --> 28:31.377
but I feel anything I can do
to help you get to Heaven...

28:31.418 --> 28:33.753
oh, I have to do it.

28:35.922 --> 28:38.300
SILVER:
It's your fault.

28:38.342 --> 28:39.677
She knows, and
it's your fault.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.011
Well, hold on, wait.

28:41.053 --> 28:43.055
Slow down. Who knows?
What are you talking about?

28:43.096 --> 28:45.307
Angela. She knows
about the movie.

28:45.349 --> 28:47.643
She saw it online last month,
but she didn't put it together.

28:47.685 --> 28:49.645
Except then,
she saw you yesterday,

28:49.687 --> 28:51.980
and now she knows
that it was me and...

28:52.022 --> 28:53.691
All right, Silver, relax,
calm down, all right?

28:53.732 --> 28:56.485
Are you having
another manic episode?
No!

28:56.527 --> 28:58.320
God, I'm allowed to have
a bad day, okay?!

28:58.362 --> 29:02.199
I'm allowed to be upset
that a video of me
having sex went viral!

29:02.241 --> 29:03.825
I'm sorry. I know.
I just wanted a fresh start,

29:03.867 --> 29:05.327
and now that's ruined

29:05.369 --> 29:06.745
because Angela knows
about the movie

29:06.786 --> 29:08.664
and she's fasting.

29:08.706 --> 29:11.500
Wait, hold on. What?
She says that she's
not going to eat again

29:11.542 --> 29:13.669
until I come out of hiding,

29:13.711 --> 29:16.338
and I tell everyone about
my "checkered past,"

29:16.380 --> 29:18.591
because that's going
to bring me inner peace.

29:18.632 --> 29:20.008
Really?
Yes.

29:20.050 --> 29:21.009
It's ridiculous.

29:21.051 --> 29:23.429
Not that ridiculous.

29:23.470 --> 29:24.471
What?

29:27.391 --> 29:30.143
Well, the fasting stuff
is, obviously,

29:30.185 --> 29:32.688
but the stuff about
how you have to stop hiding--

29:32.730 --> 29:34.189
it's what you've
been doing, Silver.

29:34.231 --> 29:36.609
You're working so hard to keep
this whole thing a secret.

29:36.650 --> 29:38.193
Oh, I'm sorry.

29:38.235 --> 29:40.654
What do you want me to do,
send out some mass e-mail

29:40.696 --> 29:43.407
telling everyone,
"Hey, I made a sex video

29:43.449 --> 29:44.700
because I'm bipolar"?

29:44.742 --> 29:46.619
I'm not telling you
to send out an e-mail.

29:46.660 --> 29:48.287
But you're going to have
to do something

29:48.328 --> 29:49.538
to stop this girl
from fasting.

29:49.580 --> 29:50.956
Right?

29:50.997 --> 29:52.040
No.

29:52.082 --> 29:54.084
You're just going to let
her keep going?

29:54.126 --> 29:55.794
I'm not in charge of her.

29:55.835 --> 29:59.715
Wow, there's no end to
what you'll do to avoid
dealing with this.

29:59.757 --> 30:02.342
But you know what,
I'm not even surprised.

30:02.384 --> 30:03.552
You already
transferred schools.

30:03.594 --> 30:05.471
You're afraid
to leave the house.

30:05.512 --> 30:08.056
You don't know what it's like.
I don't?

30:08.098 --> 30:09.600
I have news for you.

30:09.642 --> 30:11.393
I was in that movie, too.

30:11.435 --> 30:12.603
Only, instead of hiding,

30:12.645 --> 30:14.896
I dealt with all the whispering
and all the looks.

30:14.938 --> 30:16.940
Which wasn't easy, by the way,
but I did it.

30:16.982 --> 30:19.401
And you're going to have to
figure out how to do that, too,

30:19.443 --> 30:21.445
if you're ever
going to move on.

30:33.999 --> 30:36.209
I'm not surprised, Navid.

30:36.251 --> 30:39.630
I mean, we were asking
a lot from your parents.

30:39.672 --> 30:42.382
I'll just... I'll figure
something else out.

30:42.424 --> 30:44.635
(door opening)

30:45.803 --> 30:46.720
(phone beeps off)

30:48.930 --> 30:50.557
What are you doing?

30:53.101 --> 30:54.394
I chose you.

30:54.436 --> 30:55.771
What?!

30:55.813 --> 30:57.648
Navid, they're your family.

30:57.690 --> 30:59.983
They're not going to stop me
from doing this, Ade.

31:00.025 --> 31:02.611
You're all
that I want, and...

31:02.653 --> 31:05.781
Wait, wait, this is not
how it's supposed to go.

31:05.823 --> 31:07.073
How what's supposed to go?

31:07.115 --> 31:09.993
Well, our proposal was
such a non-proposal, you know?

31:10.035 --> 31:11.453
So, I was going to get

31:11.495 --> 31:13.580
my great-grandmother's ring
after we told my parents.

31:13.622 --> 31:17.376
But plans changed,
so this is from a pawnshop.

31:20.462 --> 31:23.423
I've loved you since the
first time I saw you in
the second grade.

31:23.465 --> 31:24.591
You had this ponytail,

31:24.633 --> 31:27.344
and all I ever wanted
to do was pull it.

31:27.386 --> 31:28.387
(laughing)

31:28.428 --> 31:30.263
And when you got
to the fifth grade,

31:30.305 --> 31:31.682
and you got your braces...

31:31.724 --> 31:33.933
Oh, wow, let me just say,
my heart stopped.

31:35.352 --> 31:37.062
But that's nothing compared
to our first kiss,

31:37.103 --> 31:39.606
which is bigger
than the ponytail

31:39.648 --> 31:41.775
and the braces combined.

31:41.817 --> 31:43.235
I believe in us, Ade.

31:43.276 --> 31:46.196
I can't imagine loving anyone
else as much as I love you.

31:46.238 --> 31:51.243
Or feeling as close as...
as I feel with you.

31:51.284 --> 31:54.496
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you, Ade.

31:54.538 --> 31:57.457
And the rest
of Habib's life.

31:57.499 --> 31:58.584
(laughing)

31:59.918 --> 32:01.044
So, Adrianna
Tate-Duncan...

32:02.796 --> 32:04.923
will you please marry me?

32:09.553 --> 32:11.430
Uh...

32:13.557 --> 32:14.725
I want to.

32:16.142 --> 32:17.394
I love you so much.

32:17.436 --> 32:20.814
But, um...
could you...?

32:26.945 --> 32:29.281
I have to tell you
something first.

32:29.322 --> 32:32.992
And I know that this might
change everything.

32:33.034 --> 32:35.829
And you might not
want to marry me.

32:35.871 --> 32:37.915
But I have to tell you,

32:37.956 --> 32:41.585
because you're giving up
so much, and...

32:41.627 --> 32:43.044
and you deserve the truth.

32:43.086 --> 32:45.464
Ade...

32:45.505 --> 32:46.506
what are you talking about?

32:49.217 --> 32:52.721
The father of the baby...

32:52.763 --> 32:54.431
isn't a guy from rehab.

32:58.101 --> 32:59.937
It's Ty.

33:11.531 --> 33:14.159
(door slams)

33:17.370 --> 33:19.331
I-I can't believe you.
Okay, I-I was so scared.

33:19.372 --> 33:21.583
I thought that if I told you,
you would just leave.

33:21.625 --> 33:24.169
No, you-you lied to me
the whole time!

33:26.755 --> 33:28.632
I just, I...
(door slams)

33:31.301 --> 33:33.553
I've been walking around West
Beverly, talking to that guy.

33:33.595 --> 33:34.763
You know, every time

33:34.805 --> 33:36.222
I pick you up
from play practice,

33:36.264 --> 33:37.390
I'm like,
"Hey, Ty, what's up?"

33:37.432 --> 33:38.642
Like a fool!

33:40.435 --> 33:42.187
Who else knows?

33:42.228 --> 33:44.606
Just-just Ms. Taylor
and Naomi.

33:44.648 --> 33:46.065
Naomi knew?

33:49.987 --> 33:52.447
(door slams, then opens)

33:52.489 --> 33:53.866
I've given up everything
for you, Ade.

33:53.907 --> 33:54.867
Everything! My family...
I know!

33:54.908 --> 33:56.242
No, it's the fact that you could

33:56.284 --> 33:57.577
lie to me to my...
I know!

33:57.619 --> 33:58.954
I am so sorry, okay?!

33:58.996 --> 34:00.664
I don't know
what to say

34:00.706 --> 34:02.081
except that I messed up.

34:02.123 --> 34:03.750
Which I used to do a lot of.

34:03.792 --> 34:05.210
And now I do a lot less

34:05.251 --> 34:07.086
because you make me
a better person.

34:07.128 --> 34:08.755
Okay, but I-I still
mess up sometimes.

34:08.797 --> 34:10.799
And yes,
this was a big one, okay?

34:10.841 --> 34:12.175
And--
there really is no "and"

34:12.217 --> 34:14.219
except I am so sorry!

34:14.260 --> 34:15.219
(door slams)

34:15.261 --> 34:17.973
I am sorry!

34:18.014 --> 34:20.391
(sobbing)

34:29.108 --> 34:31.570
I told you I'd spend the rest
of my life with you, Ade...

34:32.987 --> 34:35.072
...so don't ever
lie to me again.

34:39.202 --> 34:40.620
And put this on your finger...

34:40.661 --> 34:42.039
(sobs)

34:42.080 --> 34:43.081
...and don't you ever

34:43.121 --> 34:45.083
take it off again.

34:45.123 --> 34:46.877
Okay?

34:46.918 --> 34:49.545
Okay. Okay.

34:49.588 --> 34:50.714
Okay.

34:50.755 --> 34:51.965
Okay.

34:52.007 --> 34:53.466
(laughs)

34:53.507 --> 34:54.509
I love you so much.

34:54.551 --> 34:55.886
I love you so much.

34:58.013 --> 35:00.515
NAOMI:
And I don't know why
Mrs. Jackson was so upset.

35:00.557 --> 35:03.184
I was very discreet when I gave
her the number for my waxer.

35:03.226 --> 35:05.812
It's not like I said, "You got
a moustache, get it fixed."

35:05.854 --> 35:07.773
Yeah, I guess some people
are just ultra sensitive

35:07.814 --> 35:08.899
about that kind of thing.

35:08.941 --> 35:10.525
Sometimes school
is just too much.

35:10.567 --> 35:12.402
Oh, Liam doesn't
like you, by the way.
What?

35:12.444 --> 35:14.821
Oh, he's gun-shy

35:14.863 --> 35:16.281
about relationships;
he's freaking out

35:16.322 --> 35:17.407
'cause he's so into me.

35:17.449 --> 35:18.700
Classic self-sabotage stuff.

35:18.742 --> 35:20.118
He admitted that?

35:20.159 --> 35:21.787
Oh, he didn't have to;
it was obvious.

35:21.828 --> 35:22.788
Psychology 101.

35:22.829 --> 35:23.789
(chuckles)

35:23.830 --> 35:25.123
All right, well,
honestly, Naomi,

35:25.164 --> 35:26.917
I think he might
just be a creep.

35:26.959 --> 35:28.919
I know that's what
he wants me to think,

35:28.961 --> 35:30.670
but I'm onto him.

35:30.712 --> 35:31.671
Okay.

35:31.713 --> 35:32.839
Just be careful.

35:32.881 --> 35:34.674
He's the one who
should be careful.

35:34.716 --> 35:36.093
He doesn't think he's
boyfriend material,

35:36.134 --> 35:38.428
but he's gonna be my
boyfriend sooner or later.

35:39.596 --> 35:40.597
Jen!

35:40.639 --> 35:42.599
Darling!

35:42.641 --> 35:43.976
(laughs)
Mwa!

35:44.017 --> 35:45.268
ANNIE:
Who's this?

35:45.310 --> 35:46.269
This is my sister!

35:46.311 --> 35:47.437
This is Jen!
Oh.

35:47.479 --> 35:48.647
Hi.

35:48.688 --> 35:50.107
(both laugh)

35:50.189 --> 35:51.316
Well, don't
just stand there.

35:51.357 --> 35:52.776
Grab some glasses.
Um, okay.

35:52.818 --> 35:53.860
JEN:
Come on.

35:53.902 --> 35:55.278
Let's have a toast.

35:56.488 --> 35:57.572
(singsongy):
I'm baaack.

35:57.614 --> 35:58.531
(all laugh)

35:59.699 --> 36:00.575
(glasses ring)

36:04.663 --> 36:05.998
JEN:
The whole thing

36:06.039 --> 36:07.666
was so last minute.

36:07.707 --> 36:09.084
Naomi left me
this frantic message

36:09.126 --> 36:10.251
about our father, so...
(chuckles)

36:10.293 --> 36:11.336
I immediately

36:11.377 --> 36:12.754
hopped in
a friend's private jet

36:12.796 --> 36:14.006
and voilà,

36:14.047 --> 36:16.008
here I am

36:16.049 --> 36:17.676
to rescue her
from bourgeois hell.

36:17.717 --> 36:19.427
NAOMI:
I know we all wish

36:19.469 --> 36:21.013
I could stay here forever,

36:21.054 --> 36:22.430
but it's just
not practical.

36:22.472 --> 36:23.765
We totally
understand.

36:23.807 --> 36:24.766
Totally.

36:24.808 --> 36:26.101
Actually, we don't
smoke in here.

36:26.143 --> 36:27.560
Oh.

36:27.602 --> 36:28.603
Me neither.

36:28.645 --> 36:30.939
Cigarettes are for losers.

36:30.981 --> 36:32.607
Ooh, uh...
I quit.

36:34.151 --> 36:35.610
Thank you
for helping Naomi

36:35.652 --> 36:37.737
cope with this

36:37.779 --> 36:39.447
Dionysian debacle
that is our father.

36:39.489 --> 36:40.448
I'll take it from here.

36:40.490 --> 36:42.117
Come.

36:42.159 --> 36:44.119
I have
a town car outside

36:44.161 --> 36:46.204
and a hillside bungalow at
the Chateau Marmont that'll do

36:46.245 --> 36:49.041
until we can find more
permanent accommodations.

36:49.082 --> 36:49.875
Ciao.

36:49.916 --> 36:51.043
Can you help with my...

36:51.084 --> 36:52.627
Getting your stuff.
Oh, coming right up, yeah.

36:52.669 --> 36:55.130
(laughs)

36:55.172 --> 36:57.423
Well, I'm gonna miss you
around here, you know.

36:57.465 --> 36:58.633
Yeah, I do.

36:58.675 --> 37:00.468
(both chuckle)
Oh, hey, one thing.

37:00.510 --> 37:02.470
If you guys ever do
a remodel around here,

37:02.512 --> 37:03.471
you might think about

37:03.513 --> 37:05.473
fixing the air ducts.

37:05.515 --> 37:06.599
Sound really travels.

37:06.641 --> 37:07.976
Trust me,

37:08.018 --> 37:09.477
someday Dixon will be grateful

37:09.519 --> 37:11.479
that I cut up
those awful jeans of his.

37:11.521 --> 37:13.565
God, you heard?

37:13.606 --> 37:15.233
Is that why you called
your sister?

37:15.274 --> 37:16.651
Well, I can't live

37:16.693 --> 37:18.319
with you guys forever,
plus I needed help

37:18.361 --> 37:20.155
with my debacle of a dad.

37:20.197 --> 37:21.656
(laughs)

37:21.698 --> 37:23.742
And I was starting to
get mercury poisoning

37:23.783 --> 37:25.368
from your mom's
salmon fetish.

37:25.410 --> 37:26.745
(scoffs)

37:26.786 --> 37:28.038
Oh, wow.

37:28.080 --> 37:29.831
Santa Monica High School
has a teen parenting program.

37:29.873 --> 37:31.166
I could apply to go
to school there.

37:31.208 --> 37:32.667
They have
a day care on site.

37:32.709 --> 37:33.668
This is perfect.

37:33.710 --> 37:34.961
Oh, and I was
thinking about

37:35.003 --> 37:36.171
getting a job at The Peach Pit.

37:36.213 --> 37:37.172
(gentle laugh)

37:37.214 --> 37:38.506
Perfect.

37:38.548 --> 37:41.676
Okay, anything
you don't want, throw out.

37:41.718 --> 37:43.428
We're gonna have to
clean out that guest room

37:43.469 --> 37:44.470
to make room for the kid.

37:44.512 --> 37:46.139
And you'd better
be getting a job.

37:46.181 --> 37:47.849
You are not living here
rent-free, that's for sure.

37:47.891 --> 37:48.975
I wouldn't dream
of it, ma'am.

37:49.017 --> 37:50.185
ADRIANNA:
Who knew she'd be

37:50.227 --> 37:52.353
the parent that
came through for us, huh?

37:55.065 --> 37:57.650
Oh, I'm...

37:57.692 --> 37:58.651
I'm sorry.

37:58.693 --> 38:01.571
I didn't mean it like that.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.115
No, it's okay.

38:03.156 --> 38:04.282
I mean, it's
true, right?

38:04.323 --> 38:08.036
Damn, who knew bassinets
were so complicated?

38:08.078 --> 38:10.663
Navid, are you sure
that you're okay?

38:10.705 --> 38:12.916
I'm positive.

38:14.209 --> 38:15.961
Hey.

38:16.002 --> 38:17.003
All I need is you.

38:19.547 --> 38:22.467
And maybe a handyman to
help me build this thing.

38:22.508 --> 38:25.303
(both laugh)

38:25.344 --> 38:27.513
(chalk squeaking)

38:30.142 --> 38:32.060
Angela, would you like
to solve for X?

38:45.782 --> 38:47.993
SISTER MARY ELIZABETH:
No pulse.

38:48.034 --> 38:49.119
Angela is dead.

38:51.121 --> 38:53.748
She died for your sins, Erin.

38:53.790 --> 38:55.750
ALL (chanting):
She died for your sins.

38:55.792 --> 38:59.587
She died for your sins.
She died for your sins.

38:59.629 --> 39:01.506
(gasps)

39:09.806 --> 39:11.683
(exhales sharply)

39:13.643 --> 39:14.853
(sighs)

39:20.525 --> 39:22.485
"Bipolar."
Which means...?

39:22.527 --> 39:23.820
Apparently that
you're a sex maniac.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.822
Why'd she send
this e-mail?

39:25.864 --> 39:27.157
Still crazy,
I guess.

39:27.199 --> 39:29.075
Speak
of the devil.

39:29.117 --> 39:31.119
GIRL:
There's the slut.

39:31.161 --> 39:33.163
GIRL 2:
Isn't that Silver?

39:33.205 --> 39:34.539
Yeah, there's gonna be...

39:34.580 --> 39:36.916
GIRL:
Ugh. That's the girl
on the Internet, right?

39:36.958 --> 39:39.211
(girls murmuring)

39:40.461 --> 39:42.088
ANGELA:
Erin! Hi!

39:42.130 --> 39:44.549
Oh, I'm so proud of you.
You did it.

39:44.590 --> 39:46.634
You came clean.
And quickly, too.

39:46.676 --> 39:49.095
I mean, it took me
five days of fasting

39:49.137 --> 39:50.096
before Deb Murphy admitted

39:50.138 --> 39:51.931
to cheating in
Earth Science.

39:51.973 --> 39:53.892
My stomach was growling
like a grizzly bear.

39:53.933 --> 39:56.311
Anyway, I'm just thrilled
to the gills.

39:56.353 --> 39:57.729
You must feel

39:57.770 --> 39:59.272
like a huge weight
has been lifted.

39:59.314 --> 40:02.650
Actually, what I feel
is humiliated

40:02.692 --> 40:04.652
and ashamed and sad.

40:04.694 --> 40:06.529
You wanted me
to get into Heaven?

40:06.571 --> 40:09.824
Well, thanks to your extortion,
I feel like I'm in Hell.

40:17.540 --> 40:19.792
So, does West Bev
look different?

40:19.834 --> 40:20.793
Sadly, no.

40:20.835 --> 40:22.545
(laughs)

40:22.587 --> 40:24.172
Not at all.
Mr. Matthews, wait.

40:24.214 --> 40:26.091
This is my sister Jen.

40:26.132 --> 40:27.633
This is the awesome

40:27.675 --> 40:28.676
English teacher I always

40:28.718 --> 40:30.303
rave about.
Oh.

40:30.345 --> 40:32.222
Nice try, but, uh, you're not
getting an extension

40:32.264 --> 40:33.390
on that paper.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.267
Hey, Jen.
So you're the reason

40:35.308 --> 40:37.476
my little sister ends
so many sentences

40:37.518 --> 40:38.770
with dangling prepositions.

40:38.811 --> 40:40.272
About what are you talking?

40:40.313 --> 40:41.314
(laughs)

40:41.356 --> 40:42.481
(Naomi laughs)

40:43.566 --> 40:44.650
Grammar jokes.

40:44.692 --> 40:45.985
Hilarious.

40:46.027 --> 40:46.986
Right.

40:47.028 --> 40:48.780
Well, I got to get to class.

40:48.821 --> 40:50.365
You coming, Naomi?
If you insist.

40:50.407 --> 40:52.075
See you around.

40:52.117 --> 40:54.077
It was nice
to meet you.
Yeah.

40:54.119 --> 40:55.453
So I'll pick you up
at 3:00.

40:55.494 --> 40:57.330
My friend's docking
his yacht in the marina,

40:57.372 --> 40:58.581
so we'll grab
an after-school drink.

40:58.623 --> 40:59.624
Sounds perfect.

40:59.665 --> 41:00.625
Ciao.

41:00.666 --> 41:02.419
Ciao.

41:05.671 --> 41:06.714
Ethan!

41:08.091 --> 41:10.718
Jen. You're back.

41:10.760 --> 41:12.511
I sure am.

41:12.553 --> 41:14.389
How long are you staying?

41:16.099 --> 41:17.309
We'll see.

41:20.686 --> 41:22.730
(laughs)

41:22.772 --> 41:24.565
Don't worry.

41:24.607 --> 41:27.860
I'll never tell Naomi
that I was your first.
