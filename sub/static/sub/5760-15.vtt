00:07.918 --> 00:09.268
<i>My name is Melinda Gordon.</i>

00:11.968 --> 00:12.968
<i>I just got married,</i>

00:13.155 --> 00:14.555
<i>just moved to a small town,</i>

00:14.732 --> 00:16.332
<i>just opened up an antique shop.</i>

00:16.853 --> 00:18.153
<i>I might be just like you.</i>

00:19.637 --> 00:21.604
<i>Except from the time that I was a little girl,</i>

00:21.605 --> 00:23.505
<i>I knew that I could talk to the dead.</i>

00:25.122 --> 00:26.213
<i>It's all right, honey.</i>

00:26.214 --> 00:28.551
<i>Earthbound spirits, my grandmother called them,</i>

00:28.558 --> 00:29.940
<i>the ones who have not crossed over</i>

00:29.941 --> 00:34.192
<i>because they have unfinished business with the living, and they come to me for help.</i>

00:35.065 --> 00:36.163
<i>To tell you my story,</i>

00:36.670 --> 00:38.028
<i>I have to tell you theirs.</i>

00:44.749 --> 00:45.822
Andrea. Melinda.

00:47.427 --> 00:48.323
Sit over there.

00:49.268 --> 00:50.162
Oh.

00:55.725 --> 00:56.482
Hello.

00:56.497 --> 00:58.220
Welcome to room 3's talent night.

00:58.757 --> 01:00.532
One of our students, Dillon Cho,

01:00.876 --> 01:03.142
has written a very imaginative play.

01:03.745 --> 01:06.960
We hope you enjoy room 3's production of

01:07.436 --> 01:09.411
"Ghost at the crossing."

01:14.835 --> 01:17.180
You know what they say: "Write what you know."

01:20.276 --> 01:25.121
I'm so bored. My dad has gone away, and my mom's too busy to even talk to me.

01:25.706 --> 01:26.602
Hi.

01:26.735 --> 01:27.630
Wanna play?

01:27.765 --> 01:28.663
Who are you?

01:28.838 --> 01:29.730
I'm a ghost.

01:29.795 --> 01:30.763
No way.

01:31.895 --> 01:33.522
Wanna come to the railroad tracks?

01:33.527 --> 01:34.922
I'm really not supposed to.

01:35.075 --> 01:35.970
Oh, come on.

01:36.386 --> 01:39.352
We can put pennies on the tracks and watch 'em get squished.

01:39.356 --> 01:41.021
Melinda, help me.

01:47.545 --> 01:49.390

01:58.665 --> 01:59.980
- Boo.
- Hey.

02:00.865 --> 02:02.012
- How was work?
- Busy.

02:02.347 --> 02:03.242
How was the play?

02:03.446 --> 02:05.192
Spookier than I expected actually.

02:05.296 --> 02:06.191
Good for Dillon.

02:06.578 --> 02:09.661
I haven't had a chance to look through this new training manual, so

02:09.666 --> 02:11.061
I'm just gonna go do it downstairs.

02:11.067 --> 02:11.962
No. Stay.

02:12.345 --> 02:13.943
I can sleep with the lights on.

02:14.145 --> 02:15.041
All right.

02:15.277 --> 02:17.521
Hey, I forgot. Your mom called this morning.

02:19.386 --> 02:20.331
What did she want?

02:21.425 --> 02:22.711
I don't know. She didn't say.

02:22.715 --> 02:24.810
I'm thinking maybe it's birthday related.

02:25.155 --> 02:28.001
Well, you're not gonna plan anything, right? Promise me.

02:28.256 --> 02:29.442
We're not planning anything.

02:29.448 --> 02:30.342
We?

02:30.638 --> 02:31.472
Me.

02:31.478 --> 02:32.873
No one. No one is. Promise.

02:33.066 --> 02:33.953
Right.

02:33.967 --> 02:36.510
- 'Cause you know how I feel about it.
- Yes, I do.

02:37.627 --> 02:40.653
Although I was kind of hoping this year you might be over it.

02:40.657 --> 02:41.552
I'm not.

02:45.945 --> 02:46.843
You ok?

02:47.195 --> 02:48.310
Yeah. I'm just tired.

02:51.515 --> 02:53.910
Mel, I know you have some issues with your mom.

02:54.638 --> 02:55.983
And this birthday thing...

02:58.437 --> 03:01.232
- You wanna talk about it?
- What's there to talk about?

03:01.568 --> 03:04.661
Single mother didn't do a very good job. Pretty common story.

03:05.755 --> 03:07.900
But she raised a pretty uncommon daughter.

03:08.258 --> 03:09.952
Yeah, that's part of the problem.

03:21.628 --> 03:22.523
Melinda.

03:38.215 --> 03:39.113
Melinda.

03:56.165 --> 03:57.311
Do I know you?

03:59.278 --> 04:00.472
Why didn't you help me?

04:07.035 --> 04:07.931
Who are you?

04:08.558 --> 04:09.461
Don't you know?

04:12.497 --> 04:14.092
- Trouble sleeping?
- Yeah.

04:15.786 --> 04:16.680
Big trouble.

04:21.507 --> 04:22.592
<i>Can you see us?</i>

05:29.198 --> 05:30.640
We're just open. Come on in.

05:35.235 --> 05:36.133
Hi.

05:36.985 --> 05:38.630
Do you see someone in the store?

05:39.686 --> 05:40.582
Um...

05:40.647 --> 05:41.543
customer.

05:41.557 --> 05:42.450
Besides her.

05:42.987 --> 05:43.882
No.

05:45.628 --> 05:46.521
Wow.

05:47.238 --> 05:48.781
It must've been Dillon's play.

05:49.257 --> 05:51.301
I just got the weirdest feeling, like...

05:51.856 --> 05:53.352
like someone was watching me.

05:54.038 --> 05:56.281
Can a civilian catch a ghost vibe like that?

05:56.668 --> 05:57.562
A civilian?

05:58.805 --> 06:01.103
Well, maybe, but it'd have to be a pretty powerful ghost.

06:01.105 --> 06:02.692
Excuse me. How much is this?

06:18.265 --> 06:19.913
I just thought I'd wind them up.

06:21.895 --> 06:23.793
I bet you thought they were antiques.

06:27.718 --> 06:28.611
Oh, god.

06:37.897 --> 06:39.893
I can't do this. Just get in the house.

07:50.656 --> 07:51.550
Children,

07:51.587 --> 07:52.482
I have something

07:52.845 --> 07:54.361
very, very sad to tell you.

07:57.987 --> 08:01.701
Some of you may know that Sarah Applewhite has been ill this year.

08:10.225 --> 08:11.123
This morning,

08:12.216 --> 08:15.460
her parents called to tell me that Sarah passed away last night.

08:17.177 --> 08:18.310
I know this is

08:18.815 --> 08:19.712
kind of a shock.

08:20.777 --> 08:23.173
So if any of you want to talk about it further,

08:23.645 --> 08:24.543
I'm here for you.

08:29.545 --> 08:30.523
Yes, Melinda.

08:31.637 --> 08:33.820
Mrs. Riley, Sarah's not dead.

08:34.427 --> 08:36.072
She's standing right over there.

08:38.395 --> 08:39.289
Shh.

08:40.495 --> 08:42.092
I wanna talk to my mom and dad.

08:42.707 --> 08:44.500
Then why don't you go talk to them?

08:45.406 --> 08:46.481
I can't find them.

08:46.787 --> 08:48.433
That's because you're at school.

08:48.888 --> 08:50.030
Go look in your house.

08:50.408 --> 08:51.892
Melinda, this isn't funny.

08:52.595 --> 08:53.493
You heard her.

08:54.158 --> 08:55.553
She can't find her parents.

08:56.076 --> 08:57.470
Why aren't you helping her?

08:57.576 --> 08:59.132
That's enough, Melinda.

09:04.157 --> 09:05.852
Are you saying you don't see her?

09:09.006 --> 09:10.050
I don't believe you.

09:10.726 --> 09:13.233
If you don't stop this, I'll have to send you to Mr. Corbett.

09:13.238 --> 09:14.380
Why are you all lying?

09:14.676 --> 09:16.293
She's right in front of you.

09:25.477 --> 09:29.363
Oh, I am so sorry. I was in the middle of my shift, and the traffic was horrendous.

09:29.368 --> 09:31.583
Then I had to take the bridge, which made it even worse.

09:31.587 --> 09:33.433
- It's fine.
- Sweetie, what's wrong?

09:33.936 --> 09:34.800
Are you sick?

09:34.806 --> 09:36.170
No. At least we don't think so.

09:36.175 --> 09:38.121
I don't know if you've heard this, but

09:39.045 --> 09:41.291
one of Melinda's classmates has passed away.

09:41.608 --> 09:42.500
Oh, no.

09:43.008 --> 09:44.752
- Sarah Applewhite?
- That's right.

09:45.866 --> 09:50.473
- Oh, sweetie. I am so sorry.
- No, mom. They're wrong.

09:50.767 --> 09:52.801
Sarah's alive. I saw her.

09:53.155 --> 09:54.622
And nobody believes me.

09:54.948 --> 09:57.423
She's been saying this all morning. It's upsetting her classmates.

09:57.428 --> 09:59.431
Some of the other parents have had to come down.

09:59.438 --> 10:00.332
I'm so sorry.

10:01.286 --> 10:02.413
Well, she's just...

10:02.796 --> 10:04.853
- she's just emotional.
- But it's true.

10:05.706 --> 10:09.851
We thought it might be a good idea for Melinda to go home for the day, maybe rest.

10:10.556 --> 10:13.750
- Of course. You're right.
- But, mommy, you have to believe me.

10:15.241 --> 10:16.922
I am so sorry. Come on, Melinda.

10:23.845 --> 10:24.743
Mom.

10:25.740 --> 10:28.308
Mom, why won't you talk to me about Sarah?

10:29.449 --> 10:30.453
It isn't fair.

10:30.928 --> 10:31.820
Melinda,

10:32.085 --> 10:33.291
please stop doing this.

10:33.816 --> 10:37.500
I suffered through years of it with my mother. I'm not gonna go through it again.

10:37.506 --> 10:38.402
Go through what?

10:38.516 --> 10:39.913
What are you talking about?

10:40.428 --> 10:41.350
I can't do this.

10:42.207 --> 10:44.101
Just go to your room, Melinda. Go on.

10:57.787 --> 10:58.680
Sarah.

11:03.517 --> 11:04.410
It was just

11:04.417 --> 11:08.172
amazing how it all flooded back to me, how confused I was, how scared.

11:08.285 --> 11:11.030
I had no idea why I could see this girl and no one else could.

11:11.036 --> 11:12.653
I thought your grandmother had told you about all this.

11:12.657 --> 11:13.550
Not until later.

11:13.668 --> 11:15.843
My mom was so angry and embarrassed about the whole thing,

11:15.848 --> 11:18.893
she kept it a secret like we were trying to make her miserable.

11:18.895 --> 11:19.992
You know I hate that.

11:21.087 --> 11:24.090
I hate that that it happened to you. I wanna go back in time,

11:24.096 --> 11:25.841
and I wanna find that little girl,

11:25.848 --> 11:26.943
make her feel better.

11:27.138 --> 11:28.283
You know what? You do.

11:28.295 --> 11:29.191
Every day.

11:30.518 --> 11:31.513
I'm stealing these.

11:32.398 --> 11:34.641
All right, so, uh, what are you gonna do about Sarah?

11:34.648 --> 11:35.712
Well, she was shy.

11:36.237 --> 11:39.123
I remember that. So that can get a bit tricky. And ghosts have no idea

11:39.128 --> 11:41.662
how much time is going by, so I'm gonna have to go looking for her.

11:41.665 --> 11:43.113
Cool. Your first ghost hunt.

11:43.488 --> 11:47.761
Yeah. And if she's like most ghosts, she'll be haunting places that are familiar to her.

11:47.767 --> 11:48.591
Which means?

11:48.596 --> 11:50.142
Which means I have to go home.

12:01.726 --> 12:02.620
It isn't fair.

12:02.836 --> 12:04.480
Just get in the house right now.

12:30.938 --> 12:31.832
Mrs. Riley?

12:33.737 --> 12:36.422
I hope that you remember me. Melinda Gordon.

12:37.738 --> 12:38.630
Oh!

12:39.075 --> 12:40.042
Of course.

12:40.505 --> 12:41.520
Melinda!

12:42.167 --> 12:43.963
Look at you. You're all grown up.

12:44.896 --> 12:46.041
You look just radiant.

12:46.108 --> 12:47.483
Life must be agreeing with you.

12:47.488 --> 12:48.381
So far.

12:48.417 --> 12:50.662
- You look great, too.
- Oh, aren't you kind.

12:51.538 --> 12:52.631
What brings you back?

12:52.736 --> 12:56.733
Well, I've been doing a lot of thinking lately about a little girl in my class.

12:56.798 --> 12:58.293
I know it's been a long time.

12:58.415 --> 13:00.310
But do you remember Sarah Applewhite?

13:00.777 --> 13:01.790
Yeah, I do.

13:02.607 --> 13:03.711
It was terribly sad.

13:05.315 --> 13:07.213
Do you remember my reaction that day?

13:09.897 --> 13:10.793
I do.

13:11.877 --> 13:13.820
Little children have big imaginations.

13:14.295 --> 13:15.740
So don't you be embarrassed.

13:16.515 --> 13:19.212
It undoubtedly was your way of processing your grief.

13:20.075 --> 13:20.972
Right.

13:21.818 --> 13:24.140
I was wondering do you know what happened to Sarah's parents.

13:24.145 --> 13:27.300
Because I tried to look them up in the Hamilton phone book, but they were unlisted.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.651
They broke up shortly after Sarah passed away.

13:30.277 --> 13:33.971
You know, I understand that it often happens when a couple loses a child.

13:34.188 --> 13:36.070
Do you know where either one of them went?

13:36.078 --> 13:37.501
No, sweetheart, I don't.

13:38.675 --> 13:40.802
And if I did once, it's gone now.

13:42.125 --> 13:44.583
Time is a funny thing, isn't it?

13:46.125 --> 13:47.022
Yeah.

13:48.155 --> 13:49.050
It sure is.

13:59.207 --> 14:00.452
I'm running out of time.

14:03.817 --> 14:04.710
Sarah?

14:05.798 --> 14:07.943
Come on, Chloe. You're gonna miss the bus.

14:08.156 --> 14:09.051
Ok, I'm coming.

14:11.818 --> 14:15.123
I looked everywhere. All the places we used to hang out as kids. She was nowhere.

14:15.125 --> 14:16.982
Just that one glimpse, and that was it.

14:16.995 --> 14:18.593
- Can these be engraved?
- What?

14:18.596 --> 14:20.742
These soaps-- can I have them monogrammed?

14:21.046 --> 14:22.441
Why would you wanna do that?

14:22.447 --> 14:24.141
Yes. Actually,

14:24.485 --> 14:28.013
I know a place on-line that'll do that. I will write down the web site for you.

14:28.016 --> 14:30.283
I think something triggered her reappearance--

14:30.287 --> 14:34.381
something that she's not aware of. And all I have to do-- hey, we've got lotions.

14:34.488 --> 14:35.381
Back there.

14:35.615 --> 14:36.671
I'm not interested.

14:37.188 --> 14:41.250
Ok. This is their web site. And they will monogram anything. Just e-mail them.

14:41.957 --> 14:43.320
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

14:45.078 --> 14:45.972
Melinda,

14:46.608 --> 14:47.593
that was a customer.

14:47.598 --> 14:49.221
Oh, what did I say? You know what I can't figure out?

14:49.225 --> 14:51.721
Is why she's being so elusive, 'cause she was shy

14:52.138 --> 14:55.253
when she was a kid. But it's like a constant game of hide-and-seek with her.

14:55.255 --> 14:56.953
Well, maybe she's self-conscious.

14:57.408 --> 14:59.351
Andrea, ghosts are not self-conscious.

15:00.607 --> 15:01.503
Melinda.

15:03.396 --> 15:05.913
Melinda, you can see me, can't you?

15:07.197 --> 15:08.093
I know you can.

15:08.956 --> 15:12.350
- Why aren't you talking to me?
- Go away. You'll get me in trouble.

15:14.088 --> 15:15.321
Well, talk to me first.

15:19.125 --> 15:20.021
Melinda.

15:20.278 --> 15:22.573
Why are you wearing your nightgown in school?

15:30.467 --> 15:31.763
Oh, my god. You're right.

15:33.058 --> 15:34.452
You're right. She is self-conscious.

15:34.456 --> 15:37.610
That's why she disappeared when I pointed out that she was in her nightgown.

15:37.617 --> 15:38.513
You're a genius.

15:38.917 --> 15:39.810
Thank you.

15:40.255 --> 15:43.301
Now can we move these dolls 'cause they are freaking me out.

15:46.676 --> 15:49.653
Oh, bedtime already. The things I have to do.

15:50.468 --> 15:53.412
You stay and study. I have to meet someone in the bedroom.

15:53.696 --> 15:54.590
Say again?

15:54.745 --> 15:55.640
My little friend.

15:55.805 --> 15:56.702
Oh.

15:57.538 --> 15:59.483
What makes you think she's gonna come?

16:00.195 --> 16:01.751
I'm playing a hunch. See ya.

16:07.507 --> 16:08.401
Sarah.

16:08.907 --> 16:09.711
It's me.

16:10.206 --> 16:11.101
Melinda.

16:11.767 --> 16:12.862
Nobody's here but me.

16:13.658 --> 16:14.950
Can we talk for a second?

16:16.597 --> 16:17.493
So...

16:18.407 --> 16:19.300
here I am

16:19.987 --> 16:22.683
getting ready for bed in my nightgown. Just like you.

16:24.716 --> 16:25.612
Shoot.

16:27.388 --> 16:28.280
Hey, you know,

16:28.467 --> 16:31.912
why don't you come visit me and it'll be like a... like a sleepover.

16:34.018 --> 16:34.910
Or not.

16:50.788 --> 16:52.233
You know ghosts don't sleep.

16:56.308 --> 16:57.861
So you know you're a ghost.

16:58.926 --> 16:59.820
Well,

17:00.736 --> 17:02.083
I don't feel sick anymore,

17:02.608 --> 17:05.290
and I'm wandering around for like 2 days.

17:07.358 --> 17:08.250
Ok. So

17:08.714 --> 17:11.201
when you look at me, do I look older to you?

17:14.586 --> 17:16.310
Why? Is it your birthday?

17:17.805 --> 17:18.903
It will be on friday.

17:19.556 --> 17:21.040
You'll be 9. Like me.

17:22.205 --> 17:23.291
9. Right.

17:26.115 --> 17:28.460
Why were you so mean to me yesterday, Melinda?

17:29.846 --> 17:31.343
You didn't talk to me at all.

17:32.737 --> 17:34.401
I am... I am so sorry.

17:34.977 --> 17:35.872
It was just...

17:36.317 --> 17:37.212
you know.

17:38.715 --> 17:41.340
It was math. I didn't wanna make Mrs. Riley mad.

17:41.647 --> 17:42.540
Yeah.

17:42.738 --> 17:43.782
She's pretty strict.

17:45.208 --> 17:48.900
So what did you wanna talk to me about? Are you trying to find the light?

17:49.085 --> 17:49.900
Oh, no.

17:49.908 --> 17:51.603
I see the light. It's over there.

17:52.625 --> 17:54.562
Well, then why don't you go into it?

17:55.227 --> 17:57.470
You'd probably feel more at home over there.

17:58.176 --> 17:59.582
I can't. I'm worried.

18:00.387 --> 18:01.281
About what?

18:03.537 --> 18:04.450
My mom and dad.

18:05.707 --> 18:10.300
I could hear them getting into a big fight the other night outside my door in the hospital.

18:10.518 --> 18:11.762
And it was really scary.

18:12.655 --> 18:14.701
They sounded like they hated each other.

18:16.886 --> 18:18.800
I bet they were just worried about you.

18:18.808 --> 18:19.700
I went back home.

18:20.175 --> 18:21.922
Some other family lives there now.

18:23.207 --> 18:25.900
They got scared when I tried to make them talk to me.

18:26.365 --> 18:27.262
I bet.

18:27.897 --> 18:28.790
So

18:29.066 --> 18:30.760
I don't wanna do that light thing

18:31.775 --> 18:33.673
till I know where my mom and dad are.

18:35.637 --> 18:37.081
And I'm running out of time.

18:37.585 --> 18:38.682
What are their names?

18:38.966 --> 18:40.432
Jack and Grace.

18:41.225 --> 18:42.570
Daddy build the buildings,

18:42.786 --> 18:43.682
and mommy--

18:44.847 --> 18:45.742
Damn it. Sarah.

18:56.966 --> 18:58.063
He lived in Hamilton.

18:58.807 --> 19:00.391
Is it the same Jack Applewhite?

19:02.107 --> 19:03.003
It is.

19:05.675 --> 19:08.173
Hey. I don't think we're gonna be able to do Melinda's party.

19:08.175 --> 19:09.872
I was gonna say exactly the same thing.

19:09.877 --> 19:12.020
I don't get it. She's not vain in any way.

19:12.135 --> 19:13.761
Why does she dislike her birthday so much?

19:13.766 --> 19:15.413
Something to do with her mother.

19:15.445 --> 19:17.630
They had a falling-out before we ever got together.

19:17.638 --> 19:20.132
I've only met the woman myself a couple of times.

19:20.706 --> 19:23.163
If the past is any indication, until this birthday thing is over,

19:23.167 --> 19:26.112
we're going to have a very gloomy Melinda. Brace yourself.

19:26.225 --> 19:27.950
Jack Applewhite is an architect.

19:28.337 --> 19:31.722
I thought he was a contractor. Then I looked up "architects." There he was.

19:31.737 --> 19:33.771
Sarah is gonna be so excited that I found him.

19:33.776 --> 19:35.090
I have an appointment to meet with him at 2:00.

19:35.095 --> 19:36.890
Can we have lunch tomorrow instead?

19:37.376 --> 19:38.272
Yeah. Uh,

19:38.898 --> 19:39.670
sure.

19:39.675 --> 19:40.972
- Ok. Bye.
- Bye.

19:43.555 --> 19:45.752
Or she's gonna be really happy.

19:58.865 --> 19:59.760
Excuse me.

20:00.435 --> 20:03.483
My appointment with Mr. Applewhite was at 2:00, and it's now 2:45.

20:03.485 --> 20:05.133
I'm sorry. He's running a little bit late.

20:05.136 --> 20:06.471
Ok. I just have to get back to work.

20:06.477 --> 20:09.172
Marie, change of plans. I have a 3:00 with the board.

20:09.475 --> 20:10.993
- Mr. Applewhite, Hi.
- Yes.

20:11.176 --> 20:12.913
I'm Melinda Gordon. I had a 2:00 appointment.

20:12.915 --> 20:15.382
I'm very sorry. You'll have to reschedule. I have a meeting across town.

20:15.386 --> 20:17.322
Actually, I've come on a personal matter.

20:17.325 --> 20:19.961
Tell Marie I said to give you whatever time you want.

20:19.966 --> 20:22.111
I went to school with your daughter Sarah.

20:26.065 --> 20:26.962
You knew Sarah?

20:29.596 --> 20:30.493
Yeah.

20:30.497 --> 20:32.240
We were in the 4th grade together.

20:36.485 --> 20:37.980
Sarah would be just your age.

20:42.586 --> 20:43.533
What's this about?

20:45.068 --> 20:45.970
Well, I, uh...

20:46.877 --> 20:47.771
had a dream

20:48.508 --> 20:50.190
the other night about Sarah, and

20:51.116 --> 20:53.612
then I kept thinking I was seeing her everywhere.

20:53.957 --> 20:55.851
It happens to me, too. Has for years.

20:56.557 --> 20:57.600
And then last night,

20:58.867 --> 20:59.783
I saw Sarah.

21:02.728 --> 21:03.621
What?

21:05.578 --> 21:06.571
She's coming to me.

21:07.585 --> 21:08.480
Not just in

21:09.198 --> 21:10.693
dreams. I can see her spirit.

21:12.245 --> 21:13.140
I see.

21:15.595 --> 21:17.760
That's very interesting. Good luck with that.

21:17.768 --> 21:19.211
Mr. Applewhite, I'm serious.

21:19.317 --> 21:20.830
Well, I'm very late. And, um,

21:21.628 --> 21:24.570
like I said before, why don't you just call my assistant--

21:25.728 --> 21:26.921
Oh No. Don't tell me...

21:28.258 --> 21:30.340
- what the hell.
- Melinda, don't let him leave.

21:30.346 --> 21:31.842
You have to make him believe.

21:33.018 --> 21:34.300
What have you done to this elevator?

21:34.308 --> 21:36.163
Nothing. Nothing. I swear.

21:36.558 --> 21:37.453
Sarah's here.

21:37.686 --> 21:39.332
Don't say "Sarah." Say "Cookie."

21:39.445 --> 21:40.341
Cookie.

21:40.848 --> 21:42.342
Because I liked oreo cookies.

21:42.457 --> 21:46.743
She loves oreos, and you called her "cookie monster," and you shortened it.

21:49.567 --> 21:50.462
He remembers.

21:51.996 --> 21:53.842
Who are you? How are you doing this?

21:54.105 --> 21:55.073
How are you doing this?

21:55.076 --> 21:56.673
I swear, Mr. Applewhite, I just

21:57.425 --> 21:58.513
wanna help Sarah.

22:02.185 --> 22:04.783
It's easy to say someone was the love of your life.

22:05.505 --> 22:07.192
Didn't even come close to Grace and me.

22:07.197 --> 22:08.540
She knew everything about me.

22:08.545 --> 22:09.740
Good, bad, indifferent.

22:12.115 --> 22:14.310
We were poor together, successful together.

22:14.487 --> 22:16.832
We let each other down, propped each other up.

22:20.035 --> 22:22.280
I could never figure out how I got so lucky.

22:22.405 --> 22:24.652
Then we had Sarah. It was like a fairy tale.

22:28.458 --> 22:29.501
Then Sarah got sick.

22:33.905 --> 22:35.751
It became unbearable watching her...

22:37.855 --> 22:39.451
waste away watching her suffer.

22:40.178 --> 22:42.843
We saw it every time we looked at her. We saw it every time we looked at each other.

22:42.846 --> 22:44.641
And pretty soon, we just stopped...

22:45.466 --> 22:46.610
looking at each other.

22:49.366 --> 22:50.963
Sarah said that you were, um...

22:52.055 --> 22:55.390
arguing outside her hospital room the night before she died.

22:55.855 --> 22:56.753
She heard us?

22:58.535 --> 23:00.422
I didn't even know she was conscious.

23:00.438 --> 23:01.883
What were you arguing about?

23:02.377 --> 23:03.481
This new treatment.

23:04.475 --> 23:06.821
It was experimental. I wanted Sarah to try it.

23:08.217 --> 23:09.313
Grace was against it.

23:10.366 --> 23:11.262
She felt

23:11.448 --> 23:13.691
Sarah's little body had been through enough.

23:14.288 --> 23:15.530
Of course she was right.

23:16.635 --> 23:19.780
The treatment had side effects we didn't even know about then.

23:21.467 --> 23:23.263
If I had known she could hear us...

23:24.737 --> 23:26.280
She's been trying to find you.

23:28.805 --> 23:31.772
I know you're divorce, but I didn't know what to say to her.

23:31.787 --> 23:33.383
I never got over what happened.

23:34.348 --> 23:35.541
I never got over Grace.

23:38.055 --> 23:38.950
Then...

23:40.427 --> 23:42.070
last year, I ran into her again.

23:48.648 --> 23:49.542
Grace?

23:51.485 --> 23:53.080
It was like no time had passed.

23:53.968 --> 23:54.861
Went for a walk,

23:56.025 --> 23:57.521
had coffee then dinner,

23:58.578 --> 23:59.722
went for another walk.

24:01.605 --> 24:02.750
It was like a miracle.

24:03.768 --> 24:05.863
We found each other again, and it felt...

24:08.605 --> 24:09.501
new.

24:12.017 --> 24:15.560
We made plans to have dinner that friday at a restaurant we both love.

24:18.306 --> 24:19.500
But Grace never showed.

24:20.857 --> 24:21.753
I called her,

24:22.147 --> 24:23.692
but all I got was her machine.

24:26.086 --> 24:27.331
She called the next day,

24:29.396 --> 24:30.293
and I knew, uh,

24:31.478 --> 24:32.423
she'd been crying.

24:35.888 --> 24:37.081
She said 3 words to me.

24:39.377 --> 24:40.411
Too much pain.

24:45.846 --> 24:46.740
I'm sorry.

24:47.818 --> 24:49.412
She took a job in another city.

24:49.795 --> 24:50.990
Wouldn't tell me where.

24:51.907 --> 24:53.600
That was the last I heard of her.

24:54.695 --> 24:57.341
Sarah was hoping to talk to the two of you together.

25:01.666 --> 25:02.563
Is she here now?

25:02.797 --> 25:03.692
No.

25:04.686 --> 25:05.731
She's afraid that...

25:06.775 --> 25:09.023
she was responsible for your anger at Grace.

25:09.758 --> 25:10.921
I-I should tell her.

25:11.218 --> 25:13.662
I'd like to find Grace first, if you don't mind.

25:15.657 --> 25:18.801
It's important to Sarah that she talk to both of you together.

25:18.947 --> 25:20.341
What if you don't find her?

25:20.535 --> 25:21.432
Well...

25:23.156 --> 25:24.203
then I'll come back.

25:26.885 --> 25:28.253
Melinda, what did he say?

25:28.645 --> 25:31.193
You don't have to hide, Sarah. No one can see you.

25:32.168 --> 25:33.061
You can.

25:33.847 --> 25:36.641
Yeah, well, there aren't a whole lot of people like me.

25:36.787 --> 25:38.212
Maybe none, for all I know.

25:39.947 --> 25:40.821
Look,

25:40.828 --> 25:43.982
Sarah, your father loved your mother very much.

25:44.875 --> 25:47.573
But you were right. They don't live together anymore.

25:47.768 --> 25:50.161
- Because I got sick.
- No, it's not your fault.

25:51.217 --> 25:53.251
- They love you.
- Then where's my mom?

25:53.736 --> 25:56.633
- Moved away. We don't know where.
- Maybe your mom knows.

25:56.786 --> 25:57.532
What?

25:57.537 --> 25:58.932
Our moms were friends once.

25:59.048 --> 26:00.891
They knew each other in high school.

26:02.116 --> 26:03.260
Why don't you ask her?

26:08.636 --> 26:09.782
I can't go see my mom.

26:10.228 --> 26:13.093
She's never made me feel anything but ashamed and embarrassed of

26:13.107 --> 26:14.651
what I can do. It's like she's

26:14.887 --> 26:17.733
jealous that the gift skipped a generation or something.

26:18.857 --> 26:19.751
She called again.

26:20.788 --> 26:21.733
You have to tell me that?

26:21.737 --> 26:24.311
I think she just wanted suggestions for a birthday present.

26:24.317 --> 26:27.652
Oh, well, that's touching, considering that she ruined birthdays for me forever.

26:27.657 --> 26:28.552
Mel...

26:30.627 --> 26:32.371
don't give her that kind of power.

26:33.485 --> 26:35.182
It's your birthday. Take it back.

26:35.296 --> 26:36.290
I would if I could.

26:37.677 --> 26:38.570
Believe me.

26:45.958 --> 26:47.583
Yay! Well done.

26:48.536 --> 26:51.702
- I love you. My big girl.
- I love you, too, mommy.

26:52.038 --> 26:55.501
Why don't you girls go inside and get her presents while I'm cutting the cake.

26:55.505 --> 26:56.901
Did you make a wish, honey?

26:57.785 --> 26:59.233
Was it what we talked about?

26:59.326 --> 27:00.573
What did you talk about?

27:00.647 --> 27:04.860
Oh, we had a little chat about the importance of birthdays and how it gives us

27:05.067 --> 27:09.422
the perfect chance to be grateful for the most important gift that we have together.

27:09.627 --> 27:11.020
Mother, what are you doing?

27:11.626 --> 27:12.623
It's her birthday.

27:13.217 --> 27:15.113
It's not a day for celebrating death.

27:15.177 --> 27:16.370
We're celebrating life.

27:16.657 --> 27:19.502
By taking her on macabre field trips to funeral parlors?

27:19.798 --> 27:22.553
- Don't think I didn't hear about that.
- Melinda needs to be educated.

27:22.556 --> 27:25.401
- I am trying to protect her from that.
- Mommy, grandma.

27:25.466 --> 27:28.270
Melinda, why don't you go inside and join the girls for a moment.

27:28.275 --> 27:30.350
No, Beth. She should stay right here.

27:30.806 --> 27:33.002
Melinda's gift is nothing to be ashamed of.

27:33.238 --> 27:35.961
And you can't avoid the reality of it forever.

27:36.426 --> 27:37.871
Ok, mother, fine.

27:38.388 --> 27:39.283
I give up.

27:39.496 --> 27:40.393
From now on,

27:40.478 --> 27:44.372
you just celebrate her birthday any damn way you want and leave me out of it.

27:45.126 --> 27:47.493
Melinda, I'm gonna go lie down. I'm getting another migraine,

27:47.497 --> 27:48.893
thanks to your grandmother.

28:07.838 --> 28:08.731
Hi, mom.

28:08.866 --> 28:09.761
Melinda.

28:10.325 --> 28:11.222
Is everything ok?

28:11.715 --> 28:12.651
Are you all right?

28:12.658 --> 28:14.172
Yeah. Everything's fine.

28:15.556 --> 28:17.003
I just wasn't expecting you.

28:18.638 --> 28:20.031
It was kind of last minute.

28:20.115 --> 28:21.112
You look beautiful.

28:24.415 --> 28:25.313
Well, come in.

28:28.448 --> 28:29.680
Sorry about the mess.

28:31.247 --> 28:34.792
I've been so busy lately, the house has gotten kind of out of control.

28:36.298 --> 28:38.022
Not that it was ever in control.

28:39.188 --> 28:40.873
Anyway, you know what I mean.

28:44.236 --> 28:45.990
- How's Jim?
- He's fine.

28:47.278 --> 28:50.821
I've been meaning to come out and see what you've done with the house.

28:51.535 --> 28:52.932
It all sounds so wonderful.

28:53.936 --> 28:55.850
Somehow I just haven't had the time.

28:58.985 --> 29:00.282
Hey, well, come sit down.

29:01.397 --> 29:02.511
You want something to drink?

29:02.516 --> 29:04.613
No. Thanks. I can only stay for a minute.

29:07.066 --> 29:08.212
Oh. I was hop--

29:10.768 --> 29:11.662
well...

29:12.886 --> 29:13.901
that's just fine.

29:15.646 --> 29:18.211
It's so good to see you. You cut your hair.

29:19.717 --> 29:20.712
It's very becoming.

29:21.656 --> 29:22.553
It really is.

29:23.165 --> 29:24.311
Why is she so nervous?

29:24.415 --> 29:27.113
I came here because I needed to get some information,

29:27.208 --> 29:29.763
- and I thought you'd be able to help me.
- Me?

29:29.985 --> 29:33.203
Do you remember Sarah Applewhite? She was in my 4th-grade class.

29:33.217 --> 29:35.840
Of course, darling. I went to high school with her mother.

29:35.847 --> 29:38.392
We used to get together when you kids were babies.

29:39.078 --> 29:39.971
Of course then

29:40.507 --> 29:41.832
poor Sarah got sick, and

29:42.448 --> 29:45.371
Grace and Jack kind of closed ranks on the outside world.

29:46.616 --> 29:48.010
But then you know the rest.

29:48.578 --> 29:50.822
Actually, I'm just now remembering the rest.

29:51.147 --> 29:53.240
First time I ever saw a spirit, remember?

29:55.915 --> 29:58.600
- Melinda, do we have to?
- Do we have to what?

29:59.136 --> 30:01.580
Why does everything always come back to spirits?

30:01.725 --> 30:03.731
Why do you hate talking about it so much?

30:03.738 --> 30:07.522
Because it upsets me. All I ever wanted for you was a normal life.

30:07.766 --> 30:08.662
Why, mom?

30:08.967 --> 30:10.371
Why is normal so good?

30:11.087 --> 30:12.821
My life is fascinating.

30:13.277 --> 30:16.122
It's extraordinary. I found a way to really help people.

30:16.555 --> 30:18.492
Why can't you just be happy about that?

30:18.495 --> 30:19.493
She can't, Melinda.

30:20.625 --> 30:21.843
Ghosts scare her.

30:22.387 --> 30:24.833
I really don't wanna get into this conversation.

30:25.806 --> 30:27.103
You came for information.

30:27.768 --> 30:29.162
Just tell me what you want.

30:30.067 --> 30:30.963
I was right.

30:31.217 --> 30:33.312
Your mom knows where my mom is. Let's go.

30:33.845 --> 30:36.323
Maybe I should go and talk to your mom alone first.

30:36.326 --> 30:37.220
Why?

30:37.458 --> 30:38.852
Well, 'cause there might be

30:39.608 --> 30:40.501
grown-up talk.

30:41.276 --> 30:44.790
Melinda, you're a kid. She's not gonna talk to you about grown-up stuff.

30:44.797 --> 30:46.031
Right. Um,

30:47.218 --> 30:50.110
well, you wanna talk to your mom and dad together, right?

30:50.808 --> 30:52.400
Uh, your dad might be hurt

30:52.966 --> 30:55.310
if he knows that you talked to your mom first.

30:56.916 --> 30:58.053
Well, ok.

30:59.296 --> 31:00.842
But how will I know it's time?

31:01.498 --> 31:02.740
Wait for me at my house.

31:03.266 --> 31:06.430
You're all grown up. I can't believe it.

31:06.597 --> 31:09.011
It was so good to talk to your mother. How is she?

31:09.017 --> 31:10.162
Good. Fine.

31:12.975 --> 31:14.723
We had a lot of laughs, she and I.

31:16.175 --> 31:20.020
I used to bring Sarah over, and you would have a ball. You'd play for hours.

31:20.887 --> 31:22.330
I'm sorry. I don't remember.

31:22.536 --> 31:24.782
Why would you? You were only 2 or 3.

31:25.636 --> 31:26.733
But for us grown-ups,

31:28.557 --> 31:29.453
those memories,

31:30.615 --> 31:31.540
they never fade.

31:32.297 --> 31:33.190
Your mother...

31:34.417 --> 31:37.062
I've never seen a woman more in love with her child.

31:37.178 --> 31:38.673
Unless, of course, it was me.

31:39.817 --> 31:42.762
We would sit there staring at the two of you in amazement.

31:42.955 --> 31:45.041
So perfect, so beautiful.

31:46.357 --> 31:47.500
The picture of health.

31:52.305 --> 31:53.202
Grace, are...

31:53.665 --> 31:54.610
are you all right?

31:56.985 --> 31:58.361
Forgive me, but you don't...

31:58.365 --> 31:59.411
you don't look well.

32:03.027 --> 32:03.923
Don't I?

32:04.806 --> 32:05.942
Uh, well, I...

32:07.727 --> 32:09.870
I suppose there's a reason for that. Um...

32:12.456 --> 32:14.113
the fact is is that I'm dying.

32:20.228 --> 32:21.122
You're sick?

32:21.697 --> 32:23.141
I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

32:23.795 --> 32:25.010
It's a genetic illness.

32:26.108 --> 32:29.950
Which means, of course, I'm the reason that Sarah got it in the first place.

32:30.466 --> 32:31.660
But I don't understand.

32:32.405 --> 32:34.441
There's treatment. People are cured now.

32:34.448 --> 32:37.782
I wouldn't let Sarah have the treatment then, and she died.

32:38.576 --> 32:41.442
How could I survive the thing that killed my little girl?

32:41.447 --> 32:43.892
Yeah, but you have your whole life ahead of you.

32:43.927 --> 32:45.283
You know, for some people,

32:45.858 --> 32:48.051
Melinda, that's not particularly good news.

32:51.235 --> 32:53.730
Did my mother ever tell you about my grandmother?

32:54.688 --> 32:55.843
She had this gift

32:56.985 --> 32:58.010
to be able to

32:58.945 --> 33:02.130
see people and talk to people after they died.

33:04.298 --> 33:05.290
Beth never told me.

33:06.708 --> 33:07.650
Do you believe it?

33:08.837 --> 33:10.582
My grandma helped a lot of people.

33:12.215 --> 33:13.463
My mom never understood.

33:15.776 --> 33:17.623
It seems that it skips a generation.

33:22.015 --> 33:22.911
Which means

33:23.216 --> 33:24.212
you can do it, too?

33:24.495 --> 33:25.940
Sarah came to me 2 days ago.

33:28.225 --> 33:29.120
Melinda.

33:33.756 --> 33:36.860
- Don't say it if it isn't true.
- It is true.

33:38.027 --> 33:39.423
And now I think I know why.

33:40.177 --> 33:42.973
Your sickness--the fact that it's gotten more serious--

33:43.278 --> 33:45.482
it's triggered Sarah to come and find you.

33:46.568 --> 33:49.063
She needs to talk to you and her father together.

33:49.345 --> 33:50.743
Are you willing to do that?

33:51.495 --> 33:52.393
Melinda,

33:54.036 --> 33:55.080
I'll meet with Jack.

33:55.367 --> 33:59.411
But you have to promise me that you won't tell him I'm sick, or I can't do this.

34:02.926 --> 34:03.822
Promise.

34:16.947 --> 34:17.842
Hi.

34:17.856 --> 34:18.753
Come on in.

34:19.906 --> 34:21.803
Hi. I got your message, but I don't--

34:27.757 --> 34:28.650
Grace?

34:31.407 --> 34:32.302
I-I don't--

34:33.967 --> 34:37.860
- are you back?
- I never left, Jack. I'm sorry.

34:40.047 --> 34:41.243
I-I-I don't understand.

34:43.755 --> 34:45.581
- You lied to me?
- Please,

34:46.177 --> 34:47.070
don't be angry.

34:47.496 --> 34:48.780
Mommy, daddy.

34:49.797 --> 34:50.692
Sarah's here.

34:55.516 --> 34:56.513
Are they still mad?

34:56.958 --> 34:59.603
She wants to know if you're still mad at each other.

34:59.655 --> 35:00.630
No, honey.

35:01.285 --> 35:02.181
I...

35:02.707 --> 35:03.603
at least I'm not.

35:04.198 --> 35:05.243
Of course we're not.

35:06.997 --> 35:07.990
Would you tell her

35:10.135 --> 35:12.982
we're so sorry that she overheard us arguing that night.

35:13.477 --> 35:14.873
We never meant to hurt her.

35:15.336 --> 35:16.233
She can hear you.

35:17.456 --> 35:19.453
Ask them if they still love each other.

35:21.636 --> 35:24.581
She wants to know if you're still in love with each other.

35:27.167 --> 35:28.411
I'll always love your...

35:29.295 --> 35:30.190
mommy, Sarah.

35:34.555 --> 35:35.453
I always have.

35:37.886 --> 35:38.782
Mommy?

35:39.265 --> 35:40.512
Grace, she's asking you.

35:42.298 --> 35:43.222
Oh, yes.

35:44.355 --> 35:45.551
I love your dad, honey.

35:45.807 --> 35:47.252
Don't ever worry about that.

35:51.945 --> 35:53.591
Does daddy know that she's sick?

35:53.766 --> 35:54.663
How did you know?

35:55.898 --> 35:56.793
Know what?

35:58.206 --> 36:01.032
I can feel it. She's sick like I was.

36:03.617 --> 36:05.620
- You have to tell daddy.
- I can't.

36:06.298 --> 36:07.191
What did she say?

36:07.818 --> 36:10.141
- I can't tell you.
- What?

36:11.218 --> 36:12.070
This is ridiculous.

36:12.077 --> 36:15.523
You call us together to talk to our daughter, then you can't tell us what she's saying?

36:15.526 --> 36:16.493
Grace, she knows.

36:18.147 --> 36:19.543
And she wants Jack to know.

36:19.776 --> 36:20.671
About what?

36:21.605 --> 36:22.950
I knew this was a mistake.

36:24.288 --> 36:25.370
I'm sorry. I can't.

36:34.825 --> 36:35.722
No, Jack.

36:36.308 --> 36:37.200
Crix.

36:42.305 --> 36:43.202
Grace.

36:47.658 --> 36:48.902
How long have you known?

36:49.728 --> 36:50.623
Since last year?

36:52.338 --> 36:53.232
Why...

36:54.538 --> 36:55.732
why didn't you tell me?

36:55.847 --> 36:57.041
I didn't want you to...

36:59.185 --> 37:00.491
watch someone you love...

37:01.746 --> 37:03.322
I wanted you to be happy.

37:04.688 --> 37:05.581
Happy?

37:07.086 --> 37:10.280
Don't you know the only time I've ever been happy was with you?

37:10.956 --> 37:12.152
I don't wanna fight it.

37:13.398 --> 37:16.141
I don't wanna survive if she couldn't. It's not right.

37:20.375 --> 37:22.121
I want you to come with me, mommy.

37:24.028 --> 37:25.181
I miss you so much.

37:29.045 --> 37:29.940
She misses you

37:30.785 --> 37:31.680
so much.

37:34.835 --> 37:36.283
I don't want you to die yet.

37:37.925 --> 37:39.210
I want you to stay here

37:40.465 --> 37:41.360
with daddy.

37:41.918 --> 37:42.913
She wants you to...

37:44.105 --> 37:45.002
get well, Grace.

37:45.707 --> 37:47.250
She wants you to be with Jack.

37:48.435 --> 37:49.333
Tell them

37:49.737 --> 37:51.123
it's ok to be happy.

37:53.926 --> 37:55.223
Tell them that I'm happy.

37:57.828 --> 38:00.220
Everything is the way that it's supposed to be.

38:03.838 --> 38:05.832
She wants you to know that she's happy.

38:09.976 --> 38:12.573
And that everything is the way it's supposed to be.

38:19.827 --> 38:21.890
- They're not mad anymore.
- No.

38:23.087 --> 38:24.482
Thanks to you, they're not.

38:31.167 --> 38:33.100
I feel like I wanna go there now.

38:34.298 --> 38:35.190
To that light.

38:36.628 --> 38:37.523
Well, I think

38:37.865 --> 38:38.760
you're ready.

38:44.545 --> 38:45.942
She's going into the light.

38:47.217 --> 38:48.111
Sarah?

38:55.275 --> 38:56.573
You'll always be with us.

38:59.298 --> 39:00.893
We'll never forget you, Cookie.

39:02.246 --> 39:03.303
Bye-bye, baby.

39:06.675 --> 39:07.570
I love you.

39:14.486 --> 39:16.080
It's not scary at all, Melinda.

39:19.095 --> 39:20.640
You can tell your mother that.

39:47.176 --> 39:49.270
Why can't you see value in what I do?

39:50.468 --> 39:51.363
What?

39:51.577 --> 39:54.622
Two people who love each other very much are together again,

39:55.387 --> 39:58.801
and that should be worth something. But for some reason, you just judge me. Why?

39:58.808 --> 40:01.743
Let me make this very clear. I have never judged you.

40:02.897 --> 40:06.733
But you have to understand. I went through the early years of this thing with you.

40:06.735 --> 40:09.532
I remember your nightmares. I remember how scared you were,

40:09.536 --> 40:12.180
how lonely you were, coming home from school crying.

40:12.516 --> 40:14.420
How do you think that makes a mother feel?

40:14.425 --> 40:16.770
- How do you think it made me feel?
- Horrible.

40:17.377 --> 40:18.311
That's my point.

40:20.898 --> 40:22.393
You know, I haven't always...

40:23.417 --> 40:25.810
wanted this gift for myself. In fact, sometimes

40:25.847 --> 40:27.742
I absolutely hate it.

40:31.065 --> 40:32.560
But I do good with it, mom.

40:33.855 --> 40:34.753
I help.

40:34.995 --> 40:36.141
Grandma helped.

40:39.696 --> 40:41.090
I understand that, Melinda.

40:42.687 --> 40:43.783
You don't know how...

40:48.618 --> 40:49.741
I am happy for you.

40:50.667 --> 40:51.561
I am.

40:53.385 --> 40:54.283
No.

40:55.048 --> 40:56.992
What is it that you're not telling me?

40:57.355 --> 41:00.421
Why is it that I always feel like there's something you wanna say and you never do?

41:00.426 --> 41:03.132
Well, I'm not scared of ghosts, if that's what you mean.

41:03.136 --> 41:05.283
I don't even know why you said that to me.

41:05.345 --> 41:06.361
I didn't say it.

41:06.826 --> 41:07.722
Yes, you did.

41:07.878 --> 41:08.671
Yesterday.

41:08.677 --> 41:10.133
No, mom, I didn't say that.

41:13.735 --> 41:14.671
Sarah said it.

41:18.416 --> 41:19.893
You saw her. You saw Sarah.

41:22.088 --> 41:22.980
No.

41:23.546 --> 41:24.743
Yes, you did.

41:24.867 --> 41:26.662
Stop it, Melinda. I didn't see her.

41:29.558 --> 41:30.453
I heard her.

41:30.707 --> 41:32.362
- Can you see them?
- No.

41:33.355 --> 41:34.253
I don't know.

41:34.685 --> 41:35.780
Sometimes maybe.

41:37.515 --> 41:38.410
I hate it.

41:38.807 --> 41:41.702
- It makes me feel like I'm crazy.
- Makes you feel crazy?

41:42.518 --> 41:45.762
Think about how I've been feeling this whole time. I was lied to

41:46.177 --> 41:48.920
by the one person that I'm supposed to trust the most.

41:50.118 --> 41:52.971
No wonder you've had headaches all these years, 'cause you've been trying to just

41:52.978 --> 41:53.871
push it away.

41:55.667 --> 41:58.061
- I can help you.
- I don't want you to help me.

41:58.156 --> 41:59.051
Ok?

42:01.145 --> 42:04.311
I'm glad that you have made your peace with this. I really am.

42:04.637 --> 42:07.080
But please, don't ask me to feel the same.

42:09.205 --> 42:10.402
Now, it's getting late.

42:11.968 --> 42:13.110
I've got things to do.

42:31.038 --> 42:31.930
Happy birthday.

42:42.186 --> 42:43.081
Ok?

42:51.697 --> 42:52.593
Ok, mom.

43:00.266 --> 43:02.263
That is unbelievable about your mother.

43:02.697 --> 43:04.442
In all these years you never knew.

43:05.017 --> 43:05.910
Strange, huh?

43:07.107 --> 43:08.903
Do you think your grandmother knew?

43:09.128 --> 43:11.501
I was just thinking about that. I wonder.

43:15.436 --> 43:16.330
Do it.

43:18.527 --> 43:19.420
All right, look,

43:20.328 --> 43:21.270
can I just say it?

43:23.476 --> 43:24.370
Oh!

43:26.548 --> 43:27.543
- Yes.
- All right.

43:32.015 --> 43:32.910
Happy birthday.

43:35.287 --> 43:36.180
Thank you.

43:37.638 --> 43:39.931
You know, I was thinking that it would be fun

43:40.507 --> 43:41.750
to go out tonight and...

43:43.168 --> 43:44.062
celebrate.

43:45.117 --> 43:46.013
You were?

43:47.215 --> 43:48.361
Yeah. Life is good.

43:49.158 --> 43:50.052
You know? And

43:50.558 --> 43:52.653
racking up another year, well, that is...

43:52.675 --> 43:53.571
that's big stuff.

43:55.326 --> 43:56.222
Damn straight.

43:58.505 --> 43:59.403
Big stuff.

44:00.777 --> 44:01.672
I'm gonna go

44:01.816 --> 44:03.260
round up the usual suspects.

44:03.708 --> 44:04.840
Sounds good.
