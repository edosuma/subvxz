[Bobby] Metallica's playing one
North American gig this year.

00:12.767 --> 00:14.734
Tonight. QuÃ©bec.

00:14.734 --> 00:17.734
Suspect trading pattern
on Pepsum Pharmaceuticals.

00:17.734 --> 00:20.133
[Ari] Peter Decker,
Quaker Ridge Financial.

00:20.133 --> 00:24.100
[Chuck] At what exact moment
did Axelrod instruct you to buy

00:24.100 --> 00:26.667
-Pepsum Pharmaceuticals?
-He never instructed me.

00:26.667 --> 00:28.567
But you believe it was
insider trading?

00:28.567 --> 00:30.667
If I had to guess,
it was probably "Dollar" Bill.

00:30.667 --> 00:33.100
I need to see your trades
for the past 90 days.

00:33.100 --> 00:35.000
Unless you got a Wells notice
with my name on it,

00:35.000 --> 00:36.200
you're not gonna see
jack shit.

00:36.200 --> 00:37.767
[lowered voice]
Get the FBI on him now.

00:37.767 --> 00:40.200
I want this motherfucker's
genome mapped.

00:40.200 --> 00:42.200
Constantine, my old friend.

00:42.200 --> 00:43.700
-You showed.
-Of course.

00:43.700 --> 00:46.266
I have been at Mundia-Tel
my entire career.

00:46.266 --> 00:49.133
What people thought was
bedrock was really bullshit.

00:49.133 --> 00:51.133
Now everyone is going to
finally see the truth.

00:51.133 --> 00:53.400
Why aren't you  prosecuting
the investment banks

00:53.400 --> 00:55.300
and hedge funds
for insider trading?

00:55.300 --> 00:57.333
[amplified voice] Go ask
the 81 convicted felons

00:57.333 --> 00:59.400
of financial crimes
currently serving time.

00:59.400 --> 01:02.200
Don't go all
Charles Foster Kane on me.

01:02.200 --> 01:05.133
-You know I've never seen it.
-You have to immediately,

01:05.133 --> 01:07.700
projected on a big screen
on film.

01:07.700 --> 01:09.467
The Statue of Liberty
attempted bombing case

01:09.467 --> 01:10.667
needs to come off
your plate.

01:10.667 --> 01:13.133
-I'm sorry?
-Eastern needs that case.

01:13.133 --> 01:16.033
I've been doing this
for two years around the clock.

01:16.033 --> 01:18.567
[Bobby] So I came up here to
unplug and I, you know, can't.

01:18.567 --> 01:20.533
How do you do it, man?

01:20.533 --> 01:22.734
Hmm. I play, man.

01:22.734 --> 01:25.433
-Sell everything.
-Everything?

01:25.433 --> 01:28.166
Take it slow,
control the bleeding.

01:28.166 --> 01:31.066
Then we'll dump sector by sector
starting with telecom.

01:31.066 --> 01:33.233
-People will think --
-That I'm out.

[metal clanks in distance]

02:18.633 --> 02:20.166
[metal tool clanks]
-Hey, Tito.

02:20.166 --> 02:21.233
Morning.

02:23.567 --> 02:24.633
[tailgate thuds]

02:24.633 --> 02:27.233
[chickens clucking]
-No blemishes.

02:27.233 --> 02:29.767
Air cell
one-tenth of an inch.

02:29.767 --> 02:32.133
Perfect color.
It's beautiful.

02:36.600 --> 02:38.700
Double yolker.
Give me the odds.

02:38.700 --> 02:41.700
About one in a thousand.
But I got six in a row once.

02:41.700 --> 02:44.367
That's quintillion to one.

02:44.367 --> 02:45.767
Franchise that fucking hen.

02:45.767 --> 02:48.367
[chickens continue clucking]

02:50.567 --> 02:52.633
-Thanks, Tito.
-Of course.

02:56.400 --> 02:58.166
Hey, you wanna trade?

02:59.533 --> 03:00.567
Sure.

03:11.633 --> 03:15.100
[gravel crackling]

03:23.633 --> 03:25.767
[beep]
-Jesus, Wags.

03:25.767 --> 03:27.500
When a guy says
sell everything,

03:27.500 --> 03:29.333
he gets a chance
to take it back.

03:29.333 --> 03:31.533
Fair enough. Not gonna.

03:31.533 --> 03:33.667
You gotta say it.

03:33.667 --> 03:35.000
I already said it.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.533
Do it smart, do it so we
don't get hurt, but do it.

03:37.533 --> 03:40.133
Once we're out of telecom,
we get out of tech.

03:40.133 --> 03:42.400
Look, if the investors
hear about this,

03:42.400 --> 03:45.333
they are gonna wonder
what the fuck is going on.

03:45.333 --> 03:48.000
No, they're not, 'cause you're
gonna call 'em and tell 'em.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.600
Tell 'em what?

03:49.600 --> 03:51.467
Tell 'em that
we're shutting down.

03:51.467 --> 03:54.433
Give them the heads up. They
can start looking elsewhere.

03:54.433 --> 03:56.467
And next week?
If you change your mind?

03:56.467 --> 04:00.000
Well, let's just
get through today. Bye.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.567
Please tell me that
this fine specimen

04:01.567 --> 04:03.533
is our line to Bobby Axelrod.

04:03.533 --> 04:06.166
He is. We just need to
link him to Pepsum.

04:06.166 --> 04:07.600
Then we'll flip him
against Axelrod.

04:07.600 --> 04:11.600
Mm. How is his, uh,
personal life?

04:11.600 --> 04:13.567
Dude, it's too perfect.

04:13.567 --> 04:16.033
"Dollar" Bill Stearn --
devoted family man.

04:16.033 --> 04:18.367
-Sunday school teacher.
-Volunteer fireman.

04:18.367 --> 04:21.300
Wow, I'm gettin'
all weepy-eyed.

04:21.300 --> 04:22.667
-Guess we gotta let him go.
[file thuds]

04:22.667 --> 04:25.266
-It hasn't even been a week.
-A week we got nothing.

04:25.266 --> 04:27.567
-We do have a theory.
-Finally! Thank you.

04:27.567 --> 04:30.767
-It's not fully worked out yet.
-But what Dale is referring to

04:30.767 --> 04:33.266
is, uh, Bill Stearn bribed

04:33.266 --> 04:35.700
the Pepsum researcher
for proprietary information

04:35.700 --> 04:37.567
on a drug called
Vaccarizine.

04:37.567 --> 04:39.600
It's an enzyme they've been
testing out in Iowa.

04:39.600 --> 04:42.233
Genetically modifies corn
so that cows can actually digest

04:42.233 --> 04:44.400
-without antibiotics and --
-It makes them shit better.

04:44.400 --> 04:46.233
I'm sorry, but does
this, uh, farm report

04:46.233 --> 04:48.266
wind up anywhere near
an arrest warrant?

04:48.266 --> 04:50.166
Well, we think that
there is a nexus

04:50.166 --> 04:52.200
between Stearn and the guys
who ran the test.

04:52.200 --> 04:54.166
We have to just
place Stearn in Iowa

04:54.166 --> 04:56.367
-at the right time --
-So no.

05:04.333 --> 05:05.467
[sighs]

05:05.467 --> 05:08.400
Don't tell him
part of the story

05:08.400 --> 05:10.467
until you know
the whole story.

05:10.467 --> 05:14.033
-Got it.
-[sighs deeply] All right.

05:14.033 --> 05:16.166
Let's go through
these bank records.

05:16.166 --> 05:17.233
[grunts]

05:17.233 --> 05:21.033
-Mm. Um...
-Yeah, what's up?

05:21.033 --> 05:22.400
[lowered voice] You still
keep emergency deodorant

05:22.400 --> 05:24.467
-in your office?
-Yeah, you need some?

05:24.467 --> 05:26.200
No.

05:31.333 --> 05:33.333
[clears throat]

05:34.500 --> 05:35.767
Grandma's recipe.

05:35.767 --> 05:38.500
Signature dish
at the Empire Diner.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.533
I thought Grandma
was a waitress.

05:40.533 --> 05:43.100
She knew her way around
a griddle, too.

05:43.100 --> 05:46.033
[Bobby] Gotta use
enough cinnamon.

05:46.033 --> 05:48.500
[utensils clinking]

05:50.633 --> 05:52.667
-Am I out of a job?
-Don't worry, Ryan.

05:52.667 --> 05:54.567
Breakfast is about
all I can handle.

05:54.567 --> 05:56.333
Yeah, trust me.
We need you back.

05:56.333 --> 05:58.467
Wow! [chuckles]
Ryan, take the morning off.

05:58.467 --> 06:00.333
-Be back for lunch?
-You got it.

06:00.333 --> 06:02.100
-Thanks.
[utensil clinks]

06:03.500 --> 06:05.734
[lips smack]
Family announcement.

06:05.734 --> 06:06.767
New boat's coming early.

06:06.767 --> 06:09.633
-The big one?
-Wow.

06:09.633 --> 06:11.200
[Bobby] Delivery
on Friday afternoon.

06:11.200 --> 06:14.500
Great. Thinking Europe,
end of summer?

06:14.500 --> 06:17.233
Mediterranean Milk Run? Nah.

06:17.233 --> 06:20.033
Can we go to the GalÃ¡pagos
to meet Lonesome George?

06:20.033 --> 06:22.000
Lonesome George is dead.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.667
Really? Oh, shit.

06:24.667 --> 06:26.200
Hey. Language.

06:26.200 --> 06:28.000
GalÃ¡pagos?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.200
GalÃ¡pagos. Nice.

06:30.200 --> 06:31.400
-How much sooner?
[mug clatters]

06:31.400 --> 06:33.667
-How 'bout next week?
[utensil clinks]

06:34.667 --> 06:36.166
Yeah, we can.

06:36.166 --> 06:38.000
[dishware clinking]

06:38.000 --> 06:39.567
If that's the thing
to do right now.

06:39.567 --> 06:41.567
Well, you know,
I was just thinking,

06:41.567 --> 06:44.567
boys will be out of school.
Perfect time in their lives.

06:44.567 --> 06:47.700
Well, maybe it's not
the perfect time in my life.

06:47.700 --> 06:50.033
Summer at the restaurant,
it's gonna be insane.

06:50.033 --> 06:51.166
All right, I get that.

06:51.166 --> 06:53.166
So we'll set something up
so you can stay in touch.

06:53.166 --> 06:55.567
Videos.
You can take trips home.

06:55.567 --> 06:58.233
"We."

06:58.233 --> 06:59.633
Did I miss us having
a conversation

06:59.633 --> 07:01.000
about this somehow?

07:01.000 --> 07:03.533
We bought the boat together.
We designed it together.

07:03.533 --> 07:06.467
Yeah, but we skipped
the part when we talk

07:06.467 --> 07:08.433
about when and how
we're using it.

07:08.433 --> 07:11.300
You hate this idea?

07:11.300 --> 07:15.667
No, I don't, 'cause I see
how much you love it.

07:15.667 --> 07:18.166
And I get why it would be
a once-in-a-lifetime for them.

07:18.166 --> 07:20.400
-I'm just...
[picks up plate]

07:20.400 --> 07:23.433
[sighs deeply]
...trying it on for a sec.

07:23.433 --> 07:29.033
Good. Okay, do that.
Then let's go. It hit me.

07:29.033 --> 07:33.600
Why work so hard if not to do
what we want, when we want?

07:33.600 --> 07:36.133
â™ª pensive music â™ª

07:36.133 --> 07:37.400
[Terri] I might've
misheard earlier,

07:37.400 --> 07:40.700
but, um, did you call
the US Attorney "dude"?

07:40.700 --> 07:42.200
-Sorry?
-Back there.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.033
I think you might've said
something like,

07:44.033 --> 07:46.734
"Dude, it's perfect,"
to the US Attorney.

07:46.734 --> 07:48.200
I don't think I said "dude."

07:48.200 --> 07:50.233
I don't even remember
saying "it's perfect."

07:50.233 --> 07:52.200
-Just repeating what I heard.
-I'm not doubting you.

07:52.200 --> 07:55.166
I just mean,
I don't think...

07:55.166 --> 07:57.233
I mean...no.

07:57.233 --> 07:59.200
Yeah, I'm being
a friend here.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.467
Wow, did I actually
say "dude"?

08:00.467 --> 08:02.200
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.
-I did. I said it.

08:02.200 --> 08:04.767
The vibe at the law firm I was
at before joining the Bureau

08:04.767 --> 08:06.033
was serious but relaxed.

08:06.033 --> 08:08.500
Okay, well, this is
serious but serious.

08:08.500 --> 08:12.033
-Remove it from your vocabulary.
-I will. Stat.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.467
No, I see.

08:14.467 --> 08:17.000
Who -- who keeps
a year's rent in the bank?

08:17.000 --> 08:20.333
I've never missed a payment,
never been late at...

08:20.333 --> 08:22.767
No, I don't.
I don't have a guarantor.

08:22.767 --> 08:26.633
Then w-why show me
the apartment at all?

08:28.467 --> 08:32.433
Just hold the place
one more day, please.

08:32.433 --> 08:33.633
Thank you.

08:33.633 --> 08:36.533
I could do it.

08:38.300 --> 08:40.166
Be your guarantor.

08:40.166 --> 08:42.500
Don't listen to my calls.

08:42.500 --> 08:44.533
Don't leave your door open.

08:44.533 --> 08:46.500
How is...

08:46.500 --> 08:49.066
Look, thanks, but I wouldn't
take your parents' money

08:49.066 --> 08:51.066
even if it wasn't
against the rules here.

08:51.066 --> 08:54.000
You're not taking anything
if you don't default.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.200
You gonna default?

08:55.200 --> 08:57.100
No.

08:57.100 --> 08:59.367
You could think about it.

08:59.367 --> 09:01.300
We could ask for
a waiver or something.

09:01.300 --> 09:05.133
And, uh, it's my money.

09:05.133 --> 09:07.633
They gave it to me
when I turned 25.

09:07.633 --> 09:09.000
[whispers] So...

09:11.734 --> 09:14.266
[exhales slowly]

09:14.266 --> 09:17.400
[gasping, moaning loudly]

09:19.133 --> 09:22.066
[continues moaning,
gasping]

09:24.266 --> 09:27.467
[moans, gasps]

09:27.467 --> 09:30.033
[exhales sharply]

09:30.033 --> 09:32.066
[moans]

09:33.500 --> 09:37.500
I was up till 4 a.m.
this morning.

09:37.500 --> 09:40.467
I was watching videos
of BASE jumpers.

09:40.467 --> 09:42.367
There was this guy --

09:42.367 --> 09:47.266
he just sails from mountain
to mountain in Yosemite.

09:47.266 --> 09:51.000
It's incredible.
He just...

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
He just takes flight.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.333
Soars over the valleys.

09:56.333 --> 09:59.233
He's weightless,
utterly free.

10:01.433 --> 10:04.433
I wanna feel what that's like
just once in my life,

10:04.433 --> 10:06.700
like I'm saying
"fuck you" to gravity.

10:08.166 --> 10:10.633
Didn't that guy die?

10:10.633 --> 10:12.600
-Yeah.
-[chuckles]

10:12.600 --> 10:14.467
Yeah, but, I mean,
he wanted to.

10:14.467 --> 10:16.100
-[chuckles]
-[chuckles]

10:19.233 --> 10:21.133
I gotta go.

10:21.133 --> 10:23.000
Come on.
Play hooky with me.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.600
I can't. I'm handling lunch.

10:25.600 --> 10:27.266
And I gotta make arrangements
for the restaurant.

10:27.266 --> 10:29.100
I can't just disappear.

10:31.200 --> 10:34.166
You sure you're
ready to do this?

10:34.166 --> 10:35.500
I didn't mean
to surprise you.

10:35.500 --> 10:39.200
Yeah, you did,
or you wouldn't have.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.333
You don't get carried away.

10:41.333 --> 10:44.633
But I know you wanted it
to be a good surprise.

10:44.633 --> 10:49.066
And it is, once I started
getting used to it.

10:51.300 --> 10:53.734
[whispers] But I do still
have to go set up for it.

10:53.734 --> 10:56.200
Okay. Go.

10:56.200 --> 10:58.533
-I'll amuse myself.
-[chuckles]

10:58.533 --> 11:01.633
Just don't go jumping
off any cliffs.

11:01.633 --> 11:03.333
I won't.

11:03.333 --> 11:05.500
Maybe I'll watch a movie.

11:05.500 --> 11:08.200
Inglourious Basterds  again?

11:08.200 --> 11:09.500
[laughs] No.

11:09.500 --> 11:12.667
I've never seen
Citizen Kane,

11:12.667 --> 11:16.100
projected, the way
you're supposed to.

11:20.500 --> 11:23.133
Perfect. I'll make a call.

11:28.633 --> 11:30.333
[Bryan] So what do we got
on the, uh, researcher?

11:30.333 --> 11:31.767
Clayton Grunwald.

11:31.767 --> 11:35.133
Farmer, agricultural scientist
for Pepsum for 20 years.

11:35.133 --> 11:38.000
One-income household, about 70K,
no travel records,

11:38.000 --> 11:40.033
no trace of Stearn in Iowa,

11:40.033 --> 11:43.100
but I don't buy a relationship
like this blooming via phone.

11:43.100 --> 11:46.233
Maybe a conference somewhere?

11:46.233 --> 11:48.233
-Neutral territory?
-Nothing.

11:48.233 --> 11:49.734
[Bryan] Then Iowa.
Stearn covered his tracks.

11:49.734 --> 11:52.266
Didn't fly, paid only cash.

11:52.266 --> 11:54.000
Maybe we pay the farmer
a visit.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.700
What, with nothing? No, no.
We -- we gotta come heavy.

11:55.700 --> 11:57.600
Otherwise, the guy says
jack shit or he --

11:57.600 --> 11:59.066
he just lawyers up.

11:59.066 --> 12:01.567
All right.

12:01.567 --> 12:03.700
What do cheap guys do?

12:03.700 --> 12:07.266
Don't look at me.
I treat my queen very well.

12:07.266 --> 12:10.667
They go dutch.
Every fuckin' time.

12:11.700 --> 12:14.700
Just to be clear...
we're frozen?

12:14.700 --> 12:17.066
We're not buying, for now.

12:17.066 --> 12:19.266
Not Carthill.
Don't fuck me like that.

12:19.266 --> 12:21.367
It's a Hondo Havlicek.
Can't miss.

12:21.367 --> 12:24.600
It is bad timing, I know.
But keep on liquidating.

12:24.600 --> 12:26.767
We were up north
of the timberline.

12:26.767 --> 12:28.333
Why are we bailing?

12:28.333 --> 12:30.033
We're not bailing.

12:30.033 --> 12:33.734
We're pruning, slowly,
so we don't scare the market.

12:33.734 --> 12:36.567
And keep this on the fucking DL.

12:36.567 --> 12:39.734
We need to be deliberate
and delicate about this.

12:39.734 --> 12:41.300
Bonsai artists.

12:41.300 --> 12:43.233
Since when do we do
delicate?

12:43.233 --> 12:45.300
Since now.

12:45.300 --> 12:47.200
Do we know how long?

12:47.200 --> 12:48.533
As long as he wants, Carly.

12:48.533 --> 12:50.500
I gotta say, I'm not
feeling this strategy.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.033
Well, then it's a good thing

12:52.033 --> 12:54.233
your feelings aren't
a fucking priority.

12:54.233 --> 12:56.333
Thank you for your time.

12:59.166 --> 13:02.033
[telephone ringing]
-[Chuck] Dale.

13:02.033 --> 13:04.166
[lowered voice] I need you
to do something for me.

13:04.166 --> 13:05.533
Yes, sir.

13:05.533 --> 13:08.033
Somewhere between "sir"
and "dude," okay?

13:08.033 --> 13:10.000
Yeah. [sighs]

13:10.000 --> 13:14.767
I need you to find a woman
named Martina Slovis.

13:14.767 --> 13:17.333
-S-L-O-V-I-S.
-[under breath] Martina Slovis.

13:17.333 --> 13:19.033
She used to live
in Cobble Hill.

13:19.033 --> 13:21.333
[pouring coffee]
-Dropped out of Brooklyn Law.

13:21.333 --> 13:24.400
And this is only
for me. Got it?

13:24.400 --> 13:27.133
You know I do.

13:27.133 --> 13:28.600
[coffeepot clatters]

13:28.600 --> 13:31.233
-[clears throat]
[bottles clink]

13:33.233 --> 13:37.233
[indistinct chatter]

13:37.233 --> 13:38.467
-Hey.
-Hmm?

13:38.467 --> 13:39.734
We got it.

13:39.734 --> 13:42.166
We ran down everything
this guy ever signed

13:42.166 --> 13:44.467
or signed up for,
and on April 25,

13:44.467 --> 13:46.533
William Stearn's
Silver Elite card

13:46.533 --> 13:48.633
was logged into
the Downtown Marriott

13:48.633 --> 13:50.367
in Des Moines, Iowa.

13:50.367 --> 13:52.166
Now he paid cash
for the hotel room,

13:52.166 --> 13:54.467
but he couldn't turn down
the reward points.

13:54.467 --> 13:57.633
[laughs] Every man is
a junkie for something.

13:57.633 --> 13:59.266
Find it, find him,
and you did.

13:59.266 --> 14:00.734
-Yeah.
-Excellent.

14:00.734 --> 14:02.500
Here's our researcher.

14:02.500 --> 14:03.600
Clayton Grunwald.

14:03.600 --> 14:05.600
We're heading to Iowa
to jump him.

14:05.600 --> 14:07.734
Aiming to have an affidavit
in your hands by Friday.

14:07.734 --> 14:09.233
-Yeah.
-Hmm.

14:09.233 --> 14:11.066
Christ.

14:11.066 --> 14:12.266
Hello, Chuck.

14:12.266 --> 14:14.000
I'm sorry.
We had a sit-down scheduled.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.533
-Can we talk?
-It's okay.

14:16.533 --> 14:19.600
-You want him here?
-What have I got to hide?

14:19.600 --> 14:20.667
Is it true you've launched

14:20.667 --> 14:22.633
a full-scale investigation
of Axe Capital?

14:22.633 --> 14:24.133
I'm not gonna answer that,
and you know it.

14:24.133 --> 14:26.633
You have heard the rumors
that Axe Capital is shuttering?

14:26.633 --> 14:28.200
The word is they're pulling
their positions.

14:28.200 --> 14:31.633
Hey, Dimonda, my office
just charged 17 people

14:31.633 --> 14:34.533
in a massive heroin conspiracy
in Rockland County,

14:34.533 --> 14:38.600
sent a corrupt mayor to prison,
and indicted a serial killer.

14:38.600 --> 14:40.400
Incredible stories
I bet the American people

14:40.400 --> 14:42.300
are dying to read about.

14:42.300 --> 14:46.400
â™ª tense music â™ª

14:46.400 --> 14:48.066
[whispers] What the fuck?

14:51.066 --> 14:53.533
Hey, p-pulling positions?
You -- you knew about this?

14:53.533 --> 14:55.500
[lowered voice] No. Get Sacker
to call her hedgie friends.

14:55.500 --> 14:57.266
Find out if he's
really closing down.

14:57.266 --> 14:58.533
You got it.

14:58.533 --> 15:02.033
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

15:02.033 --> 15:05.400
[touchscreen clicking]

15:05.400 --> 15:06.667
[keys click, computer beeps]

15:06.667 --> 15:09.433
[cellphone vibrates]
-[clicks tongue]

15:09.433 --> 15:11.266
[touchscreen clicks]

15:11.266 --> 15:13.667
-Hey, babe.
-Uh, hey.

15:13.667 --> 15:18.100
Um...which one of us has,
uh, softball duty tonight?

15:18.100 --> 15:20.633
Mm, it's your turn,
I thought.

15:20.633 --> 15:23.033
Right, right. Sorry.

15:23.033 --> 15:26.433
So much bullshit I'm dealing
with here, I lost track.

15:26.433 --> 15:28.533
How 'bout you? How are things?

15:28.533 --> 15:30.300
At work?

15:30.300 --> 15:32.567
Yeah, wherever.

15:32.567 --> 15:36.000
Everything's great.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.433
Great.

15:40.166 --> 15:42.233
I'm about to start a session.
I'll call you back, okay?

15:42.233 --> 15:44.700
-Okay. Love ya.
[touchscreen clicks]

15:44.700 --> 15:47.266
[cellphone thuds]
-[sighs] He's still not back.

15:47.266 --> 15:49.700
This is not  good.

15:52.300 --> 15:55.734
Well...we've been here
before.

15:55.734 --> 15:59.033
No, we actually haven't.

15:59.033 --> 16:01.400
He wants me to tell
our top investors

16:01.400 --> 16:03.734
we're winding down.

16:05.367 --> 16:06.767
Okay.

16:06.767 --> 16:09.300
[Wags] I don't know
what the fuck is going on,

16:09.300 --> 16:10.467
but this isn't burnout.

16:10.467 --> 16:12.633
This isn't, "I gotta go play
the Scottish courses"

16:12.633 --> 16:14.667
or run away for a week
to basketball fantasy camp.

16:14.667 --> 16:18.467
This is some kind of bullshit
midlife meltdown.

16:18.467 --> 16:22.300
Whatever it is,
it's not bullshit.

16:22.300 --> 16:24.633
For most of human history, we
all would've been dead by now.

16:24.633 --> 16:26.400
We get to this age
and we think,

16:26.400 --> 16:27.600
"What the fuck am I
still doing here?"

16:27.600 --> 16:29.734
It's disorienting.

16:29.734 --> 16:33.633
See, that's what he needs --
some of that black magic.

16:33.633 --> 16:36.200
-Go talk to him.
-No, it's only been a few days.

16:36.200 --> 16:39.033
He's still processing it
himself. What do the PMs know?

16:39.033 --> 16:41.367
That I need them to
close down the positions,

16:41.367 --> 16:44.033
not stampede the fuck
out of the corral.

16:44.033 --> 16:45.266
But they're
instinctive creatures,

16:45.266 --> 16:47.633
and without knowing exactly why,
they feel antsy,

16:47.633 --> 16:50.066
which leads them
to feeling restless,

16:50.066 --> 16:53.567
which leads to motherfucking
anarchy if we don't rein it in.

16:53.567 --> 16:56.767
What do I do
about the investors?

16:58.667 --> 17:02.200
Have Axe talk to them...
himself.

17:02.200 --> 17:04.500
Make it real for him.

17:07.300 --> 17:10.166
-[chuckles]
-Fund is frozen, Axe AWOL.

17:10.166 --> 17:11.667
And a couple of junior traders

17:11.667 --> 17:14.100
just had a 3-hour lunch
at LeFarm.

17:14.100 --> 17:16.133
[scoffs] Quick work.

17:16.133 --> 17:18.333
Just a couple texts.
People are talking.

17:18.333 --> 17:19.767
Yeah, because you know how
to get 'em talking.

17:19.767 --> 17:22.400
Don't poor mouth yourself.
[chuckles]

17:25.266 --> 17:29.000
We should, uh, get
surveillance up on Axelrod.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.133
-Uh-huh.
-[Sacker] I already told the FBI

17:30.133 --> 17:32.667
to be standing by in
anticipation of your order.

17:32.667 --> 17:34.700
I'll confirm.

17:34.700 --> 17:38.266
What the hell
is his strategy?

17:38.266 --> 17:41.533
He knows we're not gonna give up
the hunt just because he closes.

17:41.533 --> 17:43.533
Maybe he wants to quit
while he's ahead.

17:43.533 --> 17:46.000
No one quits while
they're ahead.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.600
This isn't France.
It's America.

17:47.600 --> 17:51.233
We think noblesse oblige
is a new entrÃ©e at Olive Garden.

17:51.233 --> 17:52.567
[groans]

17:52.567 --> 17:54.567
You know, there's a book
that could help you with that.

17:54.567 --> 17:56.433
-Sarno? It didn't.
[bones crack]

17:56.433 --> 17:58.700
You have to actually
read it for it to help.

17:58.700 --> 18:01.000
Mm-hmm. I'm not supposed
to just shove it up my ass?

18:01.000 --> 18:03.767
-[chuckles]
-How solid is your Iowa linkage?

18:03.767 --> 18:05.300
Solid.

18:05.300 --> 18:08.400
But he has to talk for it
to pay off. I'm on it.

18:08.400 --> 18:11.467
[Chuck] I'm tagging along.

18:11.467 --> 18:12.700
[sighs]

18:12.700 --> 18:14.767
What?

18:14.767 --> 18:17.333
Lot of firepower
for one farmer.

18:17.333 --> 18:19.433
Research scientist.

18:19.433 --> 18:23.734
-So...
[papers rustling]

18:23.734 --> 18:25.567
Why do you have to go?

18:25.567 --> 18:27.567
Excuse me?

18:27.567 --> 18:31.166
I don't wanna
be out of line,

18:31.166 --> 18:35.066
but at some point,
you might want

18:35.066 --> 18:36.367
to consider recusing yourself
from this case.

18:36.367 --> 18:40.300
The conflict of interest is --
eventually, it's...

18:40.300 --> 18:43.433
it's gonna be an issue.
So...

18:43.433 --> 18:47.133
Well...

18:47.133 --> 18:50.533
as long as you don't want
to be out of line.

18:50.533 --> 18:53.467
â™ª tense music â™ª

18:55.734 --> 18:57.467
Make sure
it's an aisle seat.

19:01.066 --> 19:03.367
[Barry]
How many times you seen it?

19:03.367 --> 19:05.200
This'll be my first.

19:05.200 --> 19:07.633
Oh, my God.
You're in for such a treat.

19:07.633 --> 19:09.200
[canister rattles]

19:09.200 --> 19:11.767
[imitates Orson Welles as Kane]
"You know, Mr. Bernstein,

19:11.767 --> 19:14.734
if I hadn't been very rich,

19:14.734 --> 19:16.734
I might've been
a really great man."

19:16.734 --> 19:18.400
Wags, man.
What are you doing here?

19:18.400 --> 19:21.467
[normal voice] Apologies for
violating the restraining order

19:21.467 --> 19:24.233
and entering Xanadu,

19:24.233 --> 19:26.700
but I got a pile of documents
for you to sign.

19:26.700 --> 19:28.633
[briefcase thuds]

19:28.633 --> 19:30.767
[sighs heavily]

19:32.633 --> 19:34.233
[radio clicks and beeps]
-Barry, clear the booth.

19:34.233 --> 19:36.066
Go swimming or something.
[radio clicks]

19:36.066 --> 19:39.000
-[Barry] Sure.
[radio thuds]

19:39.000 --> 19:40.633
[briefcase thuds, latches clack]

19:40.633 --> 19:43.033
You either appoint
an independent custodian

19:43.033 --> 19:44.734
to handle
the final audit or --

19:44.734 --> 19:47.100
You give those to
the accountants or the lawyers.

19:47.100 --> 19:49.667
-You handle the investors.
-I will.

19:49.667 --> 19:50.734
[latches click]

19:50.734 --> 19:52.333
But you and I both know
there are certain ones

19:52.333 --> 19:54.000
who deserve a sit-down
with you.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
[scoffs] This is why
you're here?

19:56.000 --> 19:57.500
Alex Collins.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.633
First person to put
$10 mil into the fund.

19:59.633 --> 20:01.500
Jesus, when did you
become such a hoarder?

20:01.500 --> 20:04.100
Frances Kingsley.
Buchanan University.

20:04.100 --> 20:07.533
-I get the point.
-And finally...

20:07.533 --> 20:09.300
Raul Gomez.

20:09.300 --> 20:11.133
New York City Police
Pension Fund.

20:13.300 --> 20:15.433
Shit.

20:15.433 --> 20:18.400
Gomez was a game-changer.

20:18.400 --> 20:21.500
He was the first real player
who saw what we knew we had.

20:21.500 --> 20:24.600
What a great day that was.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.700
If there is a reason
for all of this --

20:26.700 --> 20:29.066
a professional one --

20:29.066 --> 20:32.033
you know I am the one guy
you can tell.

20:32.033 --> 20:36.000
It'll help me to backstop.
There was --

20:36.000 --> 20:38.400
Hey. Thanks for coming.

20:43.400 --> 20:46.333
-You're gonna make those calls.
-I heard you the first time.

20:51.266 --> 20:52.600
[door opens]

20:55.600 --> 20:57.633
[sighs]

20:57.633 --> 20:59.400
[carnival music playing
over speakers]

20:59.400 --> 21:01.300
[children squeal]

21:01.300 --> 21:03.700
[screaming excitedly]

21:03.700 --> 21:05.734
This just won.

21:05.734 --> 21:08.200
[boys chatter indistinctly]

21:08.200 --> 21:09.700
Okay, basketball.
You like basketball?

21:09.700 --> 21:11.133
Yeah.

21:11.133 --> 21:13.066
One for you.
Okay, here's 20 for you.

21:13.066 --> 21:14.400
It runs out, we go home.

21:14.400 --> 21:16.033
[bell ringing]

21:16.033 --> 21:17.433
[ringing stops]

21:17.433 --> 21:20.300
Okay? I'm gonna be over here
at Shoot Out the Star. Okay?

21:20.300 --> 21:22.000
-Okay.
-All right.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.567
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

21:23.567 --> 21:25.033
[Dean] Start.

21:26.066 --> 21:29.200
[BB guns shooting rapidly]

21:30.734 --> 21:34.400
[man speaking indistinctly
over PA]

21:37.467 --> 21:38.767
Take a turn.

21:38.767 --> 21:40.600
[gunshots continue]

21:40.600 --> 21:42.033
[bills rustle]

21:42.033 --> 21:44.367
One play, please.
Keep the change.

21:44.367 --> 21:49.433
[gunshots continue, man
continues speaking indistinctly]

21:49.433 --> 21:52.133
[lowered voice]
FBI across the way.

21:52.133 --> 21:53.433
We've got about 30 seconds.

21:53.433 --> 21:57.333
Fuck. I thought there was
something about that guy.

21:57.333 --> 22:00.467
I couldn't be sure,
but...it felt wrong.

22:00.467 --> 22:04.200
They're getting desperate,
or  they're getting closer.

22:04.200 --> 22:07.266
[BB gunshots]

22:07.266 --> 22:10.400
I'm disappearing for a while.
Family trip.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.333
Yeah? Good timing.

22:12.333 --> 22:14.467
You trust the guys
between you and Decker?

22:14.467 --> 22:16.200
-Sure.
[rapid gunshots continue]

22:16.200 --> 22:18.166
Though it's hard to know
how a guy will react

22:18.166 --> 22:20.367
once he's getting
his fingernails torn out.

22:20.367 --> 22:22.033
[gunshot]
-If anybody can vouch for that,

22:22.033 --> 22:24.367
-I'm your guy.
[gunshots continue]

22:24.367 --> 22:26.767
We're all made
of the same thing --

22:26.767 --> 22:30.633
nerves, sinew,
the levers, the pulleys.

22:30.633 --> 22:35.433
Once someone's opened up,
the same thing always happens,

22:35.433 --> 22:38.100
eventually.

22:38.100 --> 22:39.700
You freak me out sometimes.

22:39.700 --> 22:41.500
[gunshots in distance]

22:41.500 --> 22:44.633
[gunshots resume]

22:48.433 --> 22:49.633
That doesn't count.

22:49.633 --> 22:52.233
[gunshots continue, stop]
-I know.

22:54.633 --> 22:58.000
[dog panting]

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
[vehicle approaches,
dog barking]

23:02.000 --> 23:04.734
[dog continues barking]

23:10.533 --> 23:12.000
[engine turns off]

23:12.000 --> 23:15.400
[dog continues barking]
-Hey there, Mr. Nice.

23:15.400 --> 23:17.200
Stop that.

23:17.200 --> 23:19.266
He'll lick you
in about two seconds.

23:19.266 --> 23:21.734
Mr. Nice, huh?
Love the name. What is he?

23:21.734 --> 23:24.266
-Purebred mutt.
-[clicking tongue] Come here.

23:24.266 --> 23:26.300
Come here, you.
Come here, you.

23:26.300 --> 23:29.667
Ohh. Yes,
you're a pretty dog. Huh?

23:29.667 --> 23:33.033
-Very, very pretty. Beautiful.
[pats dog]

23:33.033 --> 23:34.500
[chuckles] I don't know.

23:34.500 --> 23:37.500
Looks like he's got
a little shepherd in him.

23:37.500 --> 23:38.567
Chuck Rhoades.

23:38.567 --> 23:41.200
US Attorney for the Southern
District of New York.

23:41.200 --> 23:43.433
Clayton Grunwald.

23:43.433 --> 23:46.300
You mind inviting us
up to the house?

23:46.300 --> 23:49.467
-Uh...
-Special Agent Terri McCue, FBI.

23:52.400 --> 23:56.100
-Aw, hell.
-Yeah.

23:56.100 --> 23:59.233
Met Bill at a conference
a few years ago.

23:59.233 --> 24:01.633
Liked him right away.

24:01.633 --> 24:05.200
His father was a farmer,
so we had a lot in common.

24:05.200 --> 24:08.333
He knows what it's like
to wake with the sun,

24:08.333 --> 24:11.200
tend the animals,
live off what you raise.

24:12.567 --> 24:15.700
His father was
a shoe salesman...

24:15.700 --> 24:17.567
in Philadelphia.

24:17.567 --> 24:19.500
[wind whistling]

24:19.500 --> 24:22.467
â™ª tense music â™ª

24:22.467 --> 24:27.066
W-well, he talked like
a farmer, knew his stuff.

24:27.066 --> 24:28.667
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

24:28.667 --> 24:31.000
We became friends and, uh...

24:31.000 --> 24:33.533
And he helped you out.

24:33.533 --> 24:35.767
Yep, he did. He helped us out.

24:35.767 --> 24:38.734
He showed real kindness
to our family.

24:38.734 --> 24:41.734
We just closed out
Christina's college fund

24:41.734 --> 24:44.600
to pay her medical bills.

24:44.600 --> 24:46.600
He offered to take care
of the surgeries.

24:46.600 --> 24:50.100
The best doctors,
private air ambulance.

24:50.100 --> 24:51.700
Even found us
a CF support group.

24:51.700 --> 24:55.400
We figured God had decided
to send us a miracle.

24:55.400 --> 24:59.667
So you gave him
the information.

24:59.667 --> 25:03.500
Yeah. Yes.

25:03.500 --> 25:06.233
It just kinda slipped out.

25:06.233 --> 25:08.400
I was talking to a friend.

25:08.400 --> 25:10.500
Didn't seem like
such a big deal.

25:10.500 --> 25:11.734
[mouths word]

25:11.734 --> 25:14.533
I mean, I-I realized I had
a duty to the company,

25:14.533 --> 25:17.433
but I figured, how much
difference could it make?

25:17.433 --> 25:21.500
About $89 million worth,
Clayton.

25:21.500 --> 25:23.500
-[sighs]
-Shit.

25:23.500 --> 25:26.367
I'm sorry. Should he have
a lawyer for this part?

25:26.367 --> 25:27.734
[sets down glass]

25:27.734 --> 25:31.567
Well, if you would like
a lawyer, Kelly, then, uh, yes.

25:31.567 --> 25:33.700
-You can call one.
-Okay.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.767
And then, uh,
we can arrest your husband

25:35.767 --> 25:37.700
and finish this
as an interrogation.

25:37.700 --> 25:39.633
I-I don't, uh...

25:39.633 --> 25:42.633
See, right now,

25:42.633 --> 25:46.066
this seems like sort of
a friendly conversation,

25:46.066 --> 25:48.233
but it's not, really,

25:48.233 --> 25:52.367
because we all know
that it could turn hard

25:52.367 --> 25:54.567
in a different direction.

25:54.567 --> 25:56.500
And, uh, there's days
that I would push it there.

25:56.500 --> 26:01.433
But...I like it out here,

26:01.433 --> 26:03.667
and the two of you.

26:03.667 --> 26:05.400
[wind continues whistling]

26:05.400 --> 26:06.700
[glass slides on tabletop]

26:06.700 --> 26:11.266
So give me what I need to arrest
who I really need to arrest,

26:11.266 --> 26:13.200
and I will do
everything I can

26:13.200 --> 26:14.500
to make sure
that Clayton's around

26:14.500 --> 26:17.133
for Christina's
high school graduation.

26:17.133 --> 26:20.200
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

26:25.000 --> 26:27.767
Sounds like a good deal to me.

26:27.767 --> 26:29.700
[pats hand]

26:29.700 --> 26:32.567
[Bryan] So this states
that on October 27th,

26:32.567 --> 26:35.567
you gave William Stearn
the confidential results

26:35.567 --> 26:38.567
of the Pepsum GMO Vaccarizine
corn trial

26:38.567 --> 26:42.066
a full 24 hours
before it was made public.

26:42.066 --> 26:44.367
Yes, sir.

26:44.367 --> 26:46.700
I need your signature
up here.

26:46.700 --> 26:50.467
[pen scribbles, clatters]

26:50.467 --> 26:51.667
[paper and pen
slide across table]

26:51.667 --> 26:54.467
I'll be in touch in a few weeks
about your arraignment.

26:54.467 --> 26:56.433
Uh, contact a lawyer
before you come

26:56.433 --> 26:58.200
or one will be appointed
for you.

26:58.200 --> 26:59.567
Wait, you said that
if we cooperated,

26:59.567 --> 27:01.133
that Clayton wouldn't
go to jail.

27:01.133 --> 27:03.166
I said that I would do
everything I could to help.

27:03.166 --> 27:04.300
You will be entering into

27:04.300 --> 27:05.734
a deferred prosecution
agreement.

27:05.734 --> 27:09.400
I-I would've called our lawyer
if you'd made that clear.

27:09.400 --> 27:11.734
[voice breaks] Christina needs
us. She needs both of us here.

27:11.734 --> 27:14.734
You have no idea how hard
this has been on our family.

27:14.734 --> 27:17.433
[crying] I can't do this
all by myself.

27:17.433 --> 27:19.367
[breathes unevenly]

27:19.367 --> 27:21.767
You crushed 'em.
You destroyed 'em.

27:21.767 --> 27:25.066
-Well, wanna grab a bite?
-Uh, no, thank you.

27:25.066 --> 27:28.433
I got some stuff to take care of
and dinner with the governor.

27:28.433 --> 27:31.333
-Right, because it's Iowa.
-Yeah.

27:31.333 --> 27:34.467
[wind blowing]

27:36.100 --> 27:37.400
[projector whirring]

27:37.400 --> 27:40.367
[sinister music playing
over speakers]

27:44.700 --> 27:47.600
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

28:00.000 --> 28:03.767
[radio clatters, clicks]

28:03.767 --> 28:05.333
Barry, hold it.

28:05.333 --> 28:06.400
[music stops]

28:06.400 --> 28:08.600
[cellphone vibrates]

28:08.600 --> 28:10.233
How's the wind-down going?

28:10.233 --> 28:12.367
It's going.

28:12.367 --> 28:14.400
I need to know
everything's dumped

28:14.400 --> 28:16.233
before I get on that boat.

28:16.233 --> 28:18.133
We'll be out of telecom
by tomorrow,

28:18.133 --> 28:20.633
and we'll have already
started off-loading tech.

28:20.633 --> 28:23.300
Then we'll go another 5%
across the board.

28:23.300 --> 28:24.700
By the third day
of not buying,

28:24.700 --> 28:27.066
the Street is gonna think
you're crazy, I might add.

28:27.066 --> 28:29.467
I can live with that. Let 'em
think what they wanna think.

28:29.467 --> 28:31.300
-Yeah, I will.
-Okay, bye.

28:31.300 --> 28:32.433
[touchscreen clicks]

28:32.433 --> 28:35.033
[Lonnie] More hot sauce.
Thanks.

28:35.033 --> 28:37.000
[Dimonda] Hey, Lonnie.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.133
Oh, Dimonda. Hey.

28:38.133 --> 28:40.433
I didn't know
this was your beat.

28:40.433 --> 28:42.100
Yeah, I live right up
the street. Cobble Hill.

28:42.100 --> 28:43.734
Oh. Thanks.

28:43.734 --> 28:45.667
Fine dining,
US Attorney style.

28:45.667 --> 28:47.667
Yeah, not really a lot
of options out here.

28:47.667 --> 28:49.000
I'll show you sometime.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
Brooklyn is Paris now,
if you know where to look.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.266
But this is a, uh,
strange land to you, right?

28:53.266 --> 28:54.400
You're from the Upper West?

28:54.400 --> 28:57.033
What a shitty commute.

28:57.033 --> 28:58.667
To the Eastern District,
no less?

28:58.667 --> 29:00.533
That's like getting traded
from the Pats to the Titans.

29:00.533 --> 29:02.700
-Okay, we're done.
[pats shoulder]

29:02.700 --> 29:05.467
No, just starting. So you got
your big case yanked?

29:05.467 --> 29:08.600
Friend at Davis Polk said
you interviewed there last week.

29:08.600 --> 29:10.333
You unhappy
working under Chuck?

29:10.333 --> 29:14.233
I have nothing but the utmost
respect for the US Attorney.

29:14.233 --> 29:16.033
I'm writing a piece
on the exodus

29:16.033 --> 29:18.100
of assistant US attorneys
into the private sector.

29:18.100 --> 29:20.000
Right now, you're my lede,
and I was wondering--

29:20.000 --> 29:22.033
If you fuck me
by writing this story,

29:22.033 --> 29:24.533
there's not an AUSA in the world
who'll take your call.

29:24.533 --> 29:26.033
Look, I don't wanna print it.

29:26.033 --> 29:28.367
I'm working on a better
Chuck Rhoades story,

29:28.367 --> 29:30.033
one that doesn't involve you.

29:30.033 --> 29:34.066
I'm just having problems nailing
down a background source.

29:34.066 --> 29:36.633
Maybe you'd be willing
to help me out?

29:40.066 --> 29:42.066
What kind of story?

29:42.066 --> 29:43.600
Let's take a seat.

29:47.700 --> 29:49.133
[air hockey puck clacking]
-Come on, Bryan.

29:49.133 --> 29:50.433
Come on. Come on.

29:50.433 --> 29:52.166
-[Clack]
-Boom.

29:52.166 --> 29:54.066
[laughs]

29:54.066 --> 29:55.400
That was brutal.

29:55.400 --> 29:57.734
Yep, 'cause I'm awesome.

29:57.734 --> 29:59.633
I should suck
at bar sports

29:59.633 --> 30:03.066
because I...
was always studying.

30:03.066 --> 30:05.600
Yeah, but apparently, you --
you don't suck at anything.

30:05.600 --> 30:07.633
You haven't even seen
what I'm best at yet.

30:07.633 --> 30:10.433
Ohh. Snapchat me.

30:10.433 --> 30:14.333
Where's Terri?
Is she, uh...

30:14.333 --> 30:16.333
up at your hotel room or...

30:16.333 --> 30:19.033
Oh! [laughs]

30:19.033 --> 30:20.233
[glass clatters]
-Fuck.

30:20.233 --> 30:22.500
I am a little tipsy.

30:22.500 --> 30:24.200
-[laughs]
-[laughs]

30:24.200 --> 30:27.133
Me, too. Come on, is it --
is it really that obvious?

30:27.133 --> 30:28.133
-Mm.
-It's -- it's casual.

30:28.133 --> 30:29.467
I thought we were
doing a good job

30:29.467 --> 30:31.200
of keeping things
professional.

30:31.200 --> 30:33.333
Oh, absolutely. You are.

30:33.333 --> 30:36.633
But she also told me you
were really good in bed.

30:36.633 --> 30:38.100
[rock music playing over
speakers]

30:38.100 --> 30:39.233
-Hey.
-Oh, hey.

30:39.233 --> 30:40.500
-Hey.
-There's our girl.

30:40.500 --> 30:42.567
-You wanna sit down?
-Nah.

30:42.567 --> 30:44.633
No. Can I get --
I can get you a drink.

30:44.633 --> 30:46.567
Mnh.

30:46.567 --> 30:50.333
Thought I'd just...head up.

30:50.333 --> 30:53.567
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

30:53.567 --> 30:54.633
You?

30:54.633 --> 30:56.700
Yeah, I guess. Me, too.
Me, also.

30:56.700 --> 30:58.500
-Okay.
-Yes. Good night.

30:58.500 --> 31:00.533
-See ya.
-Later.

31:00.533 --> 31:01.734
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

31:01.734 --> 31:03.333
Hey.

31:03.333 --> 31:06.500
Have a fantastic night,
you guys.

31:06.500 --> 31:07.734
[chuckles]

31:07.734 --> 31:11.000
My jacket.
It's on the chair again.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.533

32:12.133 --> 32:15.433
[country music playing
over speakers]

32:15.433 --> 32:17.000
You're still here?

32:17.000 --> 32:20.633
Wow. I guess neither of you
are cuddlers, huh?

32:20.633 --> 32:22.000
-[chuckles]
-Just...

32:22.000 --> 32:23.567
knock it out and move on.
Okay. [chuckles]

32:23.567 --> 32:25.266
-[clears throat]
-Not what I was picturing.

32:25.266 --> 32:27.567
I mean, I wasn't picturing
any-- I don't picture things.

32:27.567 --> 32:29.100
I wasn't even thinking
about it.

32:29.100 --> 32:30.533
-Okay, can we not --
-Yep. Let's definitely not.

32:30.533 --> 32:33.433
Excuse me, hi. Can I get
one more and then the check?

32:33.433 --> 32:34.433
-Mm-hmm.
-[Bryan] Two, thanks.

32:34.433 --> 32:35.600
[bartender] You got it.

32:35.600 --> 32:37.133
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

32:37.133 --> 32:39.467
-[clicks tongue]
-What?

32:39.467 --> 32:44.066
[inhales sharply]
I was thinking about...

32:44.066 --> 32:46.266
your offer to guarantee
my lease.

32:46.266 --> 32:48.333
Mm.

32:48.333 --> 32:51.066
Couldn't happen
at the office. Regs.

32:52.467 --> 32:55.266
It feels weird, anyway.
I'm keeping my old apartment.

32:55.266 --> 32:56.734
Why weird?

32:56.734 --> 32:59.467
[scoffs] I don't wanna
feel beholden to you.

32:59.467 --> 33:01.400
I loan my friends money
all the time.

33:01.400 --> 33:03.667
And this isn't even a loan
that I'm offering.

33:03.667 --> 33:06.233
It's a signature.
And I've forgotten it already.

33:06.233 --> 33:08.033
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

33:08.033 --> 33:10.600
Only people with money
forget about money.

33:10.600 --> 33:12.333
-[chuckles]
-[chuckles]

33:12.333 --> 33:14.467
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

33:15.734 --> 33:17.567
-[clears throat]
-[bartender] No rush.

33:17.567 --> 33:20.667
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I got it.

33:20.667 --> 33:22.367
Thought you always
went dutch.

33:22.367 --> 33:24.133
[chuckles]

33:24.133 --> 33:26.500
Well, next time,
you can pay.

33:26.500 --> 33:31.066
Maybe at Lugers after you...
sign a 7-figure deal

33:31.066 --> 33:33.500
to Sullivan, Cromwell.

33:33.500 --> 33:35.400
What's that mean?

33:35.400 --> 33:37.533
-You're brilliant.
-Uh...

33:37.533 --> 33:39.667
Top of your class,
Stanford Law.

33:39.667 --> 33:41.200
You're gonna put in
your five years,

33:41.200 --> 33:43.467
and then you're gonna
defect to the other side,

33:43.467 --> 33:45.633
start defending
the same rich jerkoffs

33:45.633 --> 33:47.066
you're locking up now.

33:47.066 --> 33:50.333
Not a judgment.
Just a truth of our world.

33:50.333 --> 33:52.567
Not my world.

33:52.567 --> 33:54.600
I am an Aquarius
on a trust fund.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.233
-[laughs]
-[chuckles]

33:56.233 --> 33:59.633
No, I am riding this job
all the way to higher office.

33:59.633 --> 34:01.767
Okay, Senator Sacker.

34:01.767 --> 34:04.400
[clicks tongue]
That's a first step.

34:04.400 --> 34:07.500
To what? Governor?

34:07.500 --> 34:09.000
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

34:09.000 --> 34:12.300
Oh, Madam Secretary, huh?

34:12.300 --> 34:14.066
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

34:14.066 --> 34:15.567
Wait, POTUS?

34:15.567 --> 34:19.266
Not confirming.
Not denying.

34:19.266 --> 34:21.066
[laughs]

34:21.066 --> 34:22.667
Nobody plans that
at your age.

34:22.667 --> 34:24.567
Nobody who gets there
doesn't.

34:24.567 --> 34:26.333
What, you think Clinton saved

34:26.333 --> 34:28.433
that picture with Kennedy
by accident?

34:28.433 --> 34:30.133
Okay.

34:30.133 --> 34:32.066
Okay, your administration.

34:32.066 --> 34:36.600
Way down the road,
but modeling it on Roosevelt.

34:36.600 --> 34:38.400
FDR.

34:38.400 --> 34:39.734
No. Teddy.

34:39.734 --> 34:43.767
Um, solid economy policy,
progressive.

34:43.767 --> 34:45.367
You know,
I can forgive his flaws

34:45.367 --> 34:47.166
because just like
every one of us,

34:47.166 --> 34:48.533
he was a product
of his time.

34:48.533 --> 34:50.667
Plus, he wrote
one of my favorite books.

34:50.667 --> 34:52.467
Mm. Rough Riders.

34:52.467 --> 34:54.333
Mm, that one's fine.

34:54.333 --> 34:57.467
I'm talking
The Naval War of 1812.

34:57.467 --> 34:59.633
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

34:59.633 --> 35:01.033
Also good.

35:01.033 --> 35:02.433
[chuckles]

35:02.433 --> 35:05.300
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

35:13.266 --> 35:16.133
I should probably
head back to my room.

35:16.133 --> 35:17.567
A 4 a.m. wake-up, yeah?

35:17.567 --> 35:19.567
I gotta -- gotta wait
for the check.

35:19.567 --> 35:20.700
-Mm-hmm.
[sets down glass]

35:20.700 --> 35:22.133
And then I'll...go.

35:22.133 --> 35:24.467
[mouths word]

35:24.467 --> 35:27.700
Oh, uh, if your game
stays tight,

35:27.700 --> 35:30.600
I'll keep you in mind
for Attorney General.

35:30.600 --> 35:32.066
-[chuckles]
-Good night.

35:32.066 --> 35:33.433
-Good night.

Chuck?

35:56.767 --> 35:59.200
I'm outside a club again.

36:01.200 --> 36:04.500
I don't know
how I ended up here.

36:04.500 --> 36:07.734
I'm listening.

36:07.734 --> 36:12.233
[whispers] I feel
so out of control, Wendy.

36:12.233 --> 36:15.166
You wanna go inside?

36:16.367 --> 36:18.233
Oh, fuck, yes.

Good.

I'm gonna leave you there
for a while.

Yeah, well,
if this continues, fuck it.

39:19.266 --> 39:20.567
You and I set up shop.

39:20.567 --> 39:23.533
I got the contacts, the ideas,
the killer instinct.

39:23.533 --> 39:27.100
You're not just a solid earner.
You know what else you are?

39:30.767 --> 39:32.266
-[laughs]
-All right.

39:32.266 --> 39:33.500
I figured you'd want
to go off on your own.

39:33.500 --> 39:35.400
Why didn't I save any money?

39:35.400 --> 39:39.200
Fucking Hamptons rental, Europe,
shoes. A closet of shoes.

39:39.200 --> 39:42.367
I have $250,000
in fucking shoes.

39:42.367 --> 39:44.266
-[Jones] Are we doing this?
-Oh!

39:44.266 --> 39:46.433
Get in on the action!
I'm taking odds!

39:46.433 --> 39:48.000
[man] I got $200
says he can make it.

he doesn't.

39:49.166 --> 39:51.300
[claps hands] How are
the troops holding up?

39:51.300 --> 39:52.700
Like we're on

Omaha beach.

39:54.166 --> 39:56.400
-[Butch] Where is he?
-You know as much as I do.

39:56.400 --> 39:58.166
Dealbreaker had a blind item
about him.

39:58.166 --> 39:59.400
Says it's temporary insanity.

39:59.400 --> 40:01.133
Who said anything
about temporary?

40:01.133 --> 40:04.000
We all know he's not insane.
We gotta just...

40:04.000 --> 40:05.200
enjoy the break.

40:05.200 --> 40:06.700
This can be useful,

40:06.700 --> 40:08.600
remind us why we love
what we do.

40:08.600 --> 40:12.133
Uh, I love what I make...
or used to.

40:12.133 --> 40:15.600
Sure.
Money's a big part of it.

40:15.600 --> 40:18.066
You remember the first year
you pulled down seven figures?

40:18.066 --> 40:19.600
-Yeah, of course.
-[Wendy] What'd you do with it?

40:19.600 --> 40:22.233
Spend it on yourself?
Buy something for your families?

40:22.233 --> 40:23.300
I bought my mom
a washing machine.

40:23.300 --> 40:24.567
-What the fuck?
[laughter]

40:24.567 --> 40:28.700
She was doing laundry by hand.
It's hard on the joints.

40:28.700 --> 40:30.533
Yeah, so you buy her
a house with a maid,

40:30.533 --> 40:32.767
not an appliance from Sears,
you cheap fuck.

40:32.767 --> 40:34.667
-[Carly laughs]
-What about you, Pouch?

40:34.667 --> 40:37.100
I put it all into retirement.

40:37.100 --> 40:38.567
[chuckles] Oh, you pussy.

40:38.567 --> 40:41.367
And I staked a couple of
fighters, which was a mistake.

40:41.367 --> 40:42.633
Yeah, well, I got
a quick 5K you can make

40:42.633 --> 40:43.734
if you got the stomach
for it.

40:43.734 --> 40:46.033
Ah, behold,
the Hand of the King

40:46.033 --> 40:48.033
descends to walk among
the rabble.

40:48.033 --> 40:51.033
Hey, Wags, two of my kids just
got hired at Morgan Capital.

40:51.033 --> 40:53.100
Hmm. Funny you're complaining
to me,

40:53.100 --> 40:54.400
considering they're your  kids.

40:54.400 --> 40:55.767
[Jones] I'm ready.

40:55.767 --> 40:58.333
-[Bill] Aw, yeah!
-It's time!

40:58.333 --> 41:00.233
Final bets in, everyone.

41:00.233 --> 41:03.700
[all shouting over each other]

41:03.700 --> 41:06.667
[all chanting] Jonesy, Jonesy,
Jonesy, Jonesy, Jonesy...

41:06.667 --> 41:08.133
And...go.

41:08.133 --> 41:11.066
[all] Jonesy, Jonesy, Jonesy,
Jonesy, Jonesy!

41:11.066 --> 41:14.066
â™ª punk music â™ª

41:14.066 --> 41:17.333
[shouting indistinctly]

41:17.333 --> 41:18.633
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

41:18.633 --> 41:19.767
A couple more days,

41:19.767 --> 41:21.700
it'll be fucking
Lord of the Flies  in here.

41:21.700 --> 41:24.066
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

41:24.066 --> 41:25.333
I think it's time
for one of

41:25.333 --> 41:26.767
your offsite
team building exercises.

41:26.767 --> 41:29.600
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

41:29.600 --> 41:33.066
[all cheering]

41:33.066 --> 41:36.000
Yo, bitches, saddle up.

41:36.000 --> 41:39.033
Body sushi at
the strip joint, on me.

41:39.033 --> 41:41.333
-[all cheering]
-[man] Yeah!

41:41.333 --> 41:45.700
[leaves rustling]

41:45.700 --> 41:48.633
â™ª tense music â™ª

41:53.300 --> 41:56.266
[birds chirping]

41:56.266 --> 41:59.367
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

42:05.500 --> 42:06.767
[camera shutter clicks]

42:13.433 --> 42:17.100
[heels thudding]

42:17.100 --> 42:19.233
[doorbell rings]

42:19.233 --> 42:22.033
[door creaks]

42:22.033 --> 42:23.166
-Hi.
-Hi.

42:23.166 --> 42:25.000
I was hoping
you'd come by.

42:29.233 --> 42:31.333
-Come on in.
-Thanks.

42:32.600 --> 42:34.400
[door creaks]

42:34.400 --> 42:36.533
-[sighs]
-So how's the restaurant?

42:36.533 --> 42:38.367
Oh, you gotta come
for dinner.

42:38.367 --> 42:40.533
Lu will treat you
to a tasting menu.

42:40.533 --> 42:41.667
And bring the family.

42:41.667 --> 42:45.266
-Oh. [chuckles]
-Or, you know...

42:45.266 --> 42:47.567
maybe just the kids.
[exhales]

42:47.567 --> 42:52.533
This isn't fun...
for any of us.

42:53.734 --> 42:55.567
You trust me on that,
right?

42:55.567 --> 42:58.066
Of course.

42:58.066 --> 43:01.200
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

43:01.200 --> 43:03.033
So where's the man?

43:03.033 --> 43:05.133
Screening room.

43:05.133 --> 43:07.500
Okay.

43:07.500 --> 43:10.567
[footsteps depart]

43:10.567 --> 43:12.233
[Chuck] Are we good to move
on Bill Stearn

43:12.233 --> 43:13.467
by end of next week?

43:13.467 --> 43:15.300
[mouth full] Mm.
Already laying the groundwork.

43:15.300 --> 43:16.367
-This is delicious.
-Yeah.

43:16.367 --> 43:18.100
-Yonah's?
-Mm-hmm.

43:18.100 --> 43:19.233
The poor guy.

43:19.233 --> 43:22.600
His brother opens
a rival cart right next door.

43:22.600 --> 43:26.100
-Hmm.
-Same knish, 50 cents cheaper.

43:26.100 --> 43:27.200
You didn't.

43:27.200 --> 43:30.133
No. My God, I'm loyal.

43:30.133 --> 43:32.000
[telephone rings]

43:32.000 --> 43:33.266
[paper crinkles]

43:33.266 --> 43:34.433
[intercom beeps]
-Yeah?

43:34.433 --> 43:36.133
[Kim] I have Agent Christo
on the line.

43:36.133 --> 43:37.333
Dale?

43:37.333 --> 43:40.100
Mr. Rhoades, your wife's here.

43:40.100 --> 43:42.433
What? Where?

43:42.433 --> 43:45.767
Axelrod's house.
Entered about two minutes ago.

43:45.767 --> 43:47.567
Alone.

43:51.200 --> 43:54.367
[sighs deeply]
Axelrod's wife there, too?

44:01.066 --> 44:03.467
Not anymore.

44:06.166 --> 44:10.266
[projector whirring]

44:10.266 --> 44:11.333
You like?

44:11.333 --> 44:13.066
This is as far
as I've gotten.

44:13.066 --> 44:17.166
[sinister music playing
over speakers]

44:17.166 --> 44:18.367
[intercom beeps]

44:18.367 --> 44:20.033
Barry, can you hit
the lights, please?

44:20.033 --> 44:21.266
[projector and music stop]

44:25.533 --> 44:27.066
Thanks for coming.

44:27.066 --> 44:29.200
Thanks for not making me go all
the way to Scotland this time.

44:29.200 --> 44:31.266
[chuckles]
That was your decision.

44:31.266 --> 44:33.266
You didn't leave me
a choice.

44:33.266 --> 44:34.567
There's always a choice.

44:36.700 --> 44:39.200
So...

44:39.200 --> 44:41.367
Last time it took, what?

44:41.367 --> 44:45.700
Five days, 72 holes a day,

44:45.700 --> 44:50.033
then you broke 80 and could
finally see the market.

44:50.033 --> 44:51.467
What's it gonna take
this time?

44:51.467 --> 44:54.133
This isn't that.

44:54.133 --> 44:56.233
It's different.

44:56.233 --> 45:00.066
â™ª tense music â™ª

45:00.066 --> 45:02.767
You have any idea what
they're doing in there, Dale?

45:02.767 --> 45:05.233
I'm sorry, sir. I can't tell.

45:05.233 --> 45:07.100
Can you get
a closer look?

45:07.100 --> 45:09.567
Um...no.

45:09.567 --> 45:12.500
No, I can't, sir.
The risk will compromise us.

45:12.500 --> 45:14.533
Yeah, okay. Thanks, Dale.
Thank you.

45:14.533 --> 45:17.533
Uh...stand by.

45:17.533 --> 45:19.200
Keep me posted
minute by minute, yeah?

45:19.200 --> 45:20.200
-Okay.
[intercom beeps]

45:20.200 --> 45:21.333
[sighs]

45:21.333 --> 45:23.133
[ice rattles in cup]

45:26.400 --> 45:28.600
I think it's time to get
a wire up on Axelrod.

45:28.600 --> 45:31.400
Maybe some video, too.

45:31.400 --> 45:33.000
You'll sign
the warrant applications?

45:33.000 --> 45:34.133
Of course.

45:35.400 --> 45:36.667
Yeah, why don't we, um,

45:36.667 --> 45:39.133
order some drones
while we're at it?

45:39.133 --> 45:40.567
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

45:40.567 --> 45:42.633
Great idea.

45:42.633 --> 45:46.266
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

45:46.266 --> 45:48.200
Gonna be tough, boss.

45:48.200 --> 45:50.667
Axelrod has
round-the-clock security.

45:50.667 --> 45:52.667
Rumor is they do
random bug sweeps.

45:52.667 --> 45:54.166
Since Dale's been on him,

45:54.166 --> 45:56.300
we've never seen
the house empty once.

45:56.300 --> 45:58.700
What's your point, Bryan?

46:00.433 --> 46:03.066
I know this is a touchy subject,
but for your own sake,

46:03.066 --> 46:05.367
this brings us back
to the subject of recusal.

46:05.367 --> 46:06.734
I think you should
reconsider.

46:06.734 --> 46:08.567
[knish thuds]
-And I think that you

46:08.567 --> 46:11.333
should stop
fucking the help.

46:11.333 --> 46:12.433
[inhales sharply,
scoffs]

46:12.433 --> 46:14.467
Still nothing.

46:14.467 --> 46:16.166
No movement.
She's still in there.

46:16.166 --> 46:18.700
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

46:18.700 --> 46:20.133
So when are you leaving?

46:20.133 --> 46:22.300
Next week.

46:22.300 --> 46:24.000
New yacht's arriving
this afternoon.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.500
Most beautiful boat
you have ever seen.

46:26.500 --> 46:29.000
Designed every inch
of it ourselves.

46:29.000 --> 46:32.767
Last year, we went to visit it
at the shipyard in Estonia.

46:32.767 --> 46:36.467
We're gonna sail it down to
the GalÃ¡pagos, Buenos Aires.

46:36.467 --> 46:38.400
Who knows where else?
Everywhere.

46:38.400 --> 46:41.233
When I was at Metallica,
I just had this feeling --

46:41.233 --> 46:43.700
it was so brief --
that there was

46:43.700 --> 46:47.233
some other kind of life
I could be living.

46:47.233 --> 46:50.333
In each of us,

46:50.333 --> 46:53.200
there is another self
we do not know.

46:53.200 --> 46:55.533
What's your other self?

46:55.533 --> 46:59.233
[inhales deeply,
exhales slowly]

46:59.233 --> 47:02.200
Professional soccer player.

47:02.200 --> 47:04.667
Well, no. No, no, no.

47:04.667 --> 47:07.400
You know what
my first dream was?

47:07.400 --> 47:09.333
Famous Broadway dancer.

47:09.333 --> 47:11.533
[chuckles]

47:11.533 --> 47:13.133
You got the legs for it.

47:13.133 --> 47:15.200
Mm.

47:15.200 --> 47:16.667
[inhales deeply]

47:16.667 --> 47:18.467
[exhales deeply]

47:18.467 --> 47:20.233
Look...

47:20.233 --> 47:23.667
if you wanna do this,
go ahead.

47:23.667 --> 47:26.633
But don't just slide into it.
Make a decision.

47:26.633 --> 47:29.433
-I have.
-Then tell your people.

47:29.433 --> 47:32.367
Don't make Wags do it.

47:32.367 --> 47:35.400
You owe them that respect.

47:35.400 --> 47:38.734
[knock on door]

47:38.734 --> 47:40.433
Uh, little problem.

47:40.433 --> 47:42.233
How little?

47:42.233 --> 47:46.567
Well, uh, an FJ article is about
to drop by Michael Dimonda.

47:46.567 --> 47:48.433
It's not flattering.

47:48.433 --> 47:50.667
-All right, what does it say?
[glasses clack]

47:50.667 --> 47:53.033
Well, um... [chuckles]

47:53.033 --> 47:55.066
Oh, for Christ's sake,
rip the Band-Aid off. Come on.

47:55.066 --> 47:58.033
It says that you're
investigating Axe Capital.

47:58.033 --> 48:01.100
And how is that a problem?
Of course that was gonna leak.

48:01.100 --> 48:03.233
Well, it also says that
you're hesitating

48:03.233 --> 48:06.033
on pulling the trigger
because of a family conflict.

48:06.033 --> 48:07.333
Uh-huh.

48:07.333 --> 48:10.533
Like preferential treatment,
because your wife works --

48:10.533 --> 48:13.433
Yes, I got it. Thank you.

48:13.433 --> 48:15.000
How is it sourced?

48:15.000 --> 48:17.600
Someone inside the office,
senior official, highly placed.

48:17.600 --> 48:20.734
How do you know
it's a senior official?

48:20.734 --> 48:23.266
Because it quotes
a senior official

48:23.266 --> 48:25.033
familiar with the matter.

48:26.433 --> 48:28.200
Okay. I see.

48:28.200 --> 48:31.066
Very good. Thank you.

48:35.066 --> 48:36.300
[door closes]

48:36.300 --> 48:38.300
[sighs]

48:38.300 --> 48:40.033
[clears throat]

48:44.166 --> 48:47.467
You've reached Wendy Rhoades.
Please leave a message.

48:47.467 --> 48:49.400
[cellphone thuds]

48:49.400 --> 48:52.166
[papers rustle]

48:55.300 --> 48:57.233
Can't say that
I'm happy right now,

48:57.233 --> 48:59.667
but I do want to thank you
for meeting with me in person.

48:59.667 --> 49:01.066
[Bobby] Of course.

49:01.066 --> 49:02.767
Taking on the Police Fund
as a client

49:02.767 --> 49:05.033
was one of the proudest
moments of my life.

49:05.033 --> 49:08.333
You know, Lara comes from
three generations of cops.

49:08.333 --> 49:10.433
-Her grandpa walked a beat on --
-Bushwick.

49:10.433 --> 49:12.367
Of course I know.

49:12.367 --> 49:16.233
I deeply appreciate you taking
a flyer on us back then,

49:16.233 --> 49:17.367
when no one else would.

49:17.367 --> 49:19.233
You were a cocky prick
with terrible table manners,

49:19.233 --> 49:20.567
but I knew
there was something.

49:20.567 --> 49:23.400
I didn't keep my money
at Axe Cap because I like you.

49:23.400 --> 49:25.467
[rock music playing
over speakers]

49:25.467 --> 49:27.066
If you pull up stakes,

49:27.066 --> 49:30.133
you're handing me
a $1.5 billion problem.

49:30.133 --> 49:31.700
Time comes, I'll find you
another fund.

49:31.700 --> 49:33.066
Like who? Rangewater?

49:33.066 --> 49:36.266
Yeah, for example.
Solid returns. Smart guys.

49:36.266 --> 49:37.633
Overleveraged, though.

49:37.633 --> 49:40.066
-Then PKZ.
-No way.

49:40.066 --> 49:42.600
They have no idea
how to manage risk. None.

49:42.600 --> 49:44.467
No fucking clue how to short.

49:44.467 --> 49:48.033
Bear market, you're paying 2%
to underperform Vanguard.

49:48.033 --> 49:49.533
So you're starting
to see the problem.

49:49.533 --> 49:52.600
Picking a fund's not that
different from picking a stock.

49:52.600 --> 49:54.000
I'll find you a winner.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.367
-[man] Here you go, guys.
[bottles thud]

49:56.367 --> 49:59.700
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

49:59.700 --> 50:02.600
First Solar.

50:02.600 --> 50:05.000
Late July 2007.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.567
No. No, you're not
making me do this again.

50:07.567 --> 50:09.600
As long as I'm an investor
in this company, I'll --

50:09.600 --> 50:11.066
Okay. Okay.

50:11.066 --> 50:14.633
2007, mid-July.

50:14.633 --> 50:18.533
Broke out in good volume.
Went up to around 120.

50:18.533 --> 50:21.000
We were out of the sector
till August.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.600
We left millions on the table.
That was on me.

50:23.600 --> 50:26.633
Google. Mid-June 2004.

50:26.633 --> 50:30.000
That's a trick question.
Didn't go public till August.

50:30.000 --> 50:34.233
IPO'd $19.6 mil shares
at 84.

50:34.233 --> 50:36.633
Closed at $100.34.

50:36.633 --> 50:38.200
It was a good day
for both of us.

50:38.200 --> 50:41.500
[chuckles]

50:41.500 --> 50:44.333
Cyberonics.

50:44.333 --> 50:46.734
August 2004.

50:46.734 --> 50:49.433
Started mid-20s,
went to 40s.

50:49.433 --> 50:53.166
Then the FDA dinged
its nerve stimulator,

50:53.166 --> 50:55.700
and the stock tanked at 13.
We saw it coming.

50:55.700 --> 50:57.400
Everyone else was trying to
catch a falling knife.

50:57.400 --> 50:59.367
We made $7.4 mil that day.

50:59.367 --> 51:01.300
[laughs]

51:01.300 --> 51:02.700
How'd I do?

51:02.700 --> 51:05.300
How the hell would I know?

51:05.300 --> 51:08.533
I remember I gave you a quiz
like that the first time we met.

51:08.533 --> 51:10.066
And it wasn't the fact
that you knew so much.

51:10.066 --> 51:12.066
It was how you lit up.

51:12.066 --> 51:14.166
These companies are
living organisms to you.

51:14.166 --> 51:16.133
And I knew that if
I gave you my money,

51:16.133 --> 51:17.166
that you wouldn't sleep

51:17.166 --> 51:19.133
until you put it
in all the right places.

51:19.133 --> 51:21.000
You would do
whatever you had to

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
and wouldn't care
what it looked like.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.300
That's who I needed
looking after my cops,

51:25.300 --> 51:26.600
who I still need.

51:26.600 --> 51:29.734
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

51:29.734 --> 51:33.433
And in case
you can't tell anymore,

51:33.433 --> 51:34.633
you still lit up.

51:34.633 --> 51:36.300
[exhales]

51:36.300 --> 51:38.133
[laughs]

51:38.133 --> 51:41.066

51:45.367 --> 51:46.767
[Chuck] Hey, sweetheart.

51:46.767 --> 51:48.533
[sirens wailing]
-Oh.

51:48.533 --> 51:50.600
[horns honking]
-I'm sorry. What did you say?

51:50.600 --> 51:53.633
What's the noise?
Uh, are you at work?

51:53.633 --> 51:57.033
No. I bailed. It was slow.

51:57.033 --> 51:59.767
Well, that's a first.
Where are you?

52:01.633 --> 52:04.533
About to do
something crazy --

52:04.533 --> 52:06.633
sneaking into a show
at intermission.

52:08.567 --> 52:10.000
Which one?

52:10.000 --> 52:11.600
"On the Town."

52:11.600 --> 52:14.033
I haven't second-acted
a musical since college.

52:14.033 --> 52:15.066
[bell rings in distance]

52:15.066 --> 52:17.166
Oh, I gotta go.
They're ringing the bell.

52:17.166 --> 52:19.567
Okay, so you're not heading back
to, uh, to the office today?

52:19.567 --> 52:21.467
-No.
-Good.

52:21.467 --> 52:23.500
Okay. I'll talk to you soon.

52:23.500 --> 52:25.266
Bye.

52:31.000 --> 52:32.333
[cellphone clatters]

52:34.667 --> 52:37.333
[receiver clatters,
button clicks]

52:39.667 --> 52:42.400
Yeah, get the arrest warrant.

52:42.400 --> 52:45.567
Yes, I also thought it was
a seven to ten-day horizon.

52:45.567 --> 52:48.533
Now it's a now  horizon.

52:48.533 --> 52:51.500

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

53:23.367 --> 53:27.100
She's some tub.

53:27.100 --> 53:28.667
How the hell do I
get me one of those?

53:28.667 --> 53:30.667
You like the stock market?

53:30.667 --> 53:32.734
Hey, I could if you're
offering me a job.

53:32.734 --> 53:34.166
[chuckles] Yeah.

53:34.166 --> 53:36.266
I'm sorry. I'm getting
out of the game.

53:36.266 --> 53:40.300
Good for you, son.
Game's overrated.

53:40.300 --> 53:42.600
Man, what I wouldn't
give to be your age,

53:42.600 --> 53:44.734
plenty in the tank
and in my pocket,

53:44.734 --> 53:46.734
the open water
in front of me.

53:48.333 --> 53:50.700
So...ready to board?

53:50.700 --> 53:52.266
[cellphone vibrates]

53:52.266 --> 53:54.033
Hold on a second.

â™ª tense music â™ª

54:02.300 --> 54:04.166
[device beeps]
-[man] Excuse me.

54:04.166 --> 54:06.533
All right.
Let's get going, guys.

54:06.533 --> 54:09.600
[laughter,
indistinct conversations]

54:09.600 --> 54:12.467
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

54:17.600 --> 54:18.734
How's my hair?

54:18.734 --> 54:21.066
Spiffy.

54:21.066 --> 54:25.066
[indistinct conversations
continue]

54:25.066 --> 54:26.333
[doors bang open]

54:48.266 --> 54:51.133
[TV muted]
-Do you believe this shit?

54:51.133 --> 54:52.433
The CEO of Mundia-Tel

54:52.433 --> 54:55.066
and office presidents
in six countries

54:55.066 --> 54:56.333
caught cooking the books.

54:56.333 --> 54:58.166
[Bill]
Company's fucking bankrupt.

54:58.166 --> 54:59.367
Stocks tanked 89% already.

54:59.367 --> 55:01.400
They're talking about
suspending trading.

55:01.400 --> 55:03.467
Whole sector's swirling down
the cesspool.

55:03.467 --> 55:05.233
The whole market
is going with it.

55:05.233 --> 55:07.467
[Butch] Good thing we were out.

55:07.467 --> 55:09.567
Yeah. It sure fucking is.

55:09.567 --> 55:12.133
[Carly groans]

55:12.133 --> 55:15.266
-A-again?
-I thought I got it all out.

55:15.266 --> 55:17.400
-[laughs]
-[man] ...that body sushi.

55:17.400 --> 55:18.633
Raw fish off a stripper.

55:18.633 --> 55:21.734
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

55:28.734 --> 55:31.433
Just remember, be polite.
Keep your weapons holstered.

55:31.433 --> 55:34.100
[man] Got it.
All right, guys, let's go.

55:34.100 --> 55:37.233
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

55:40.233 --> 55:41.767
You fucking genius.

55:41.767 --> 55:44.266
Where is everybody?
They quit already?

55:44.266 --> 55:45.467
Bathroom, mostly.

55:45.467 --> 55:47.633
Body sushi
at the strip joint.

55:47.633 --> 55:49.667
[laughs] You didn't partake?

55:49.667 --> 55:52.266
I've built up a tolerance.

55:52.266 --> 55:53.633
How did you know about
Mundia-Tel?

55:55.433 --> 55:57.767
Fucking bellwether.

55:59.166 --> 56:03.100
When it went babaloo,
it sucked the whole sector

56:03.100 --> 56:05.233
down the dumpers with it.

56:05.233 --> 56:07.000
Of course, we were out
of telecom completely,

56:07.000 --> 56:08.667
and you hid it
under some rumor

56:08.667 --> 56:11.100
of your midlife crisis
or whatever?

56:11.100 --> 56:14.166
Couldn't afford to get caught
in a race for the exits.

56:14.166 --> 56:15.667
As long as the rest of them
thought I'd lost it,

56:15.667 --> 56:17.300
they wouldn't follow.

56:17.300 --> 56:20.266
I was starting to
get nervous it was real.

56:22.367 --> 56:26.600
Holy shit.

56:26.600 --> 56:28.033
It was real?

56:28.033 --> 56:30.333
For a minute there.

56:30.333 --> 56:33.066
More than a minute.

56:33.066 --> 56:37.066
Felt like...
freedom, you know?

56:37.066 --> 56:39.200
Like I could taste it.

56:39.200 --> 56:43.100
The GalÃ¡pagos?

56:43.100 --> 56:47.033
I almost got on my boat today
and didn't get back off.

56:47.033 --> 56:49.200
Why didn't you?

56:49.200 --> 56:53.133
Because I fucking love
this place.

56:54.567 --> 56:58.600
I love what I do.
I love what we  do.

56:58.600 --> 57:03.433
-[laughing]
-[laughing]

57:07.600 --> 57:09.567
We gotta be ready
to push back in hard,

57:09.567 --> 57:12.033
tomorrow or the next day,
after the market correction.

57:12.033 --> 57:13.734
We lever up again...

your computers.

-We have a warrant

57:37.100 --> 57:38.166

57:38.166 --> 57:39.633

and let us do our job.

57:39.633 --> 57:43.133
Thank you for your cooperation.
You. Get up.

57:43.133 --> 57:45.200
Yeah, you.

57:45.200 --> 57:47.467
All right, lawyer. Lawyer!

57:47.467 --> 57:48.533

57:48.533 --> 57:50.066
Sir, we have a warrant
for your arrest.

57:50.066 --> 57:51.166
-Lawyer.
-You can get a lawyer when

57:51.166 --> 57:52.567
-you're in your holding cell.
-Lawyer.

57:52.567 --> 57:54.533
William Stearn, you are under
arrest for insider trading...

57:54.533 --> 57:56.266
-Lawyer. Lawyer.
-and securities fraud.

57:56.266 --> 57:58.266
You have the right
to remain silent.

57:58.266 --> 58:00.000
You might want to exercise
that right.

58:00.000 --> 58:03.233
-[man] Come on. Let's go.
-[man] Let's go, smart guy.

58:03.233 --> 58:06.333

58:12.300 --> 58:15.367
