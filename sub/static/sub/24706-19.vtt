<i>Previously on</i> NYPD Blue:

00:03.733 --> 00:06.531
So you're representing
the precinct in the boxing tournament.

00:06.693 --> 00:09.446
I boxed intramural in school
and thought I'd give it a shot.

00:09.613 --> 00:12.002
- I boxed a little Golden Gloves.
- Is that right?

00:12.213 --> 00:14.169
- Hello!
- John, how's it going?

00:14.373 --> 00:16.841
I'm temping until
your Miss Abandando returns.

00:17.053 --> 00:21.285
Will you look at this?
Your own office.

00:21.453 --> 00:23.683
FANCY: I thought you were in
Florida Witness Protection.

00:23.853 --> 00:29.132
Yeah. Well, relocation wasn't for me,
lieutenant. I left the program.

00:29.293 --> 00:31.853
So did you miss me,
or are you here on business?

Yeah, here we go.

FANCY: Fine. Let's go.

01:15.253 --> 01:18.051

MARTINEZ: Hey, Bobby.
SIMONE: How's it going, James?

03:02.973 --> 03:06.090
- That fire last week on 7th Street.
- Yeah, fireman died.

03:06.293 --> 03:09.012
Yesterday afternoon the fire marshal
declared it an arson.

03:09.173 --> 03:12.324
- The ME made his death a homicide.
- So it's our case?

03:12.493 --> 03:15.530
Yeah. The marshal who's investigating
has an informant who can...

03:15.693 --> 03:19.083
...get to the torch through a bartender
who's a low-end drug dealer.

03:19.253 --> 03:21.289
Fire marshal
asked the chief of detectives...

03:21.413 --> 03:23.210
...for an undercover
to get the bartender.

03:23.413 --> 03:25.483
They're sending someone over
from OCCB.

03:25.653 --> 03:27.883
- Vinnie Greco's the informant?
- Who says that?

03:28.053 --> 03:30.692
Bogies at 3:00, lieu.

03:32.093 --> 03:34.209
- Who we getting on undercover?
FANCY: I don't know.

03:34.333 --> 03:36.767
- Chief of D's put it together.
- Gentlemen!

03:36.973 --> 03:40.727
- I'm Jerry Hauser. Fire marshal's office.
FANCY: Arthur Fancy. Bobby Simone.

03:40.893 --> 03:43.453
- How's it going?
- He says you two know each other.

03:43.613 --> 03:45.524
GRECO: You bet we do.
- How's it going, Vinnie?

03:45.693 --> 03:47.013
Lt. Fancy and me
are like childhood chums.

03:47.013 --> 03:47.889
Lt. Fancy and me
are like childhood chums.

03:48.053 --> 03:49.884
So he says he's got a way
to the torch?

03:50.053 --> 03:53.409
No. I can get you to the bartender
who got the torch burn medicine.

03:53.533 --> 03:56.047
You want the torch,
you gotta close that deal yourself.

03:56.173 --> 03:59.290
Bartender's name is Curtis Cangelosi.
A skell, a smalltime dealer.

03:59.413 --> 04:04.123
Got big. So day after the fire,
I'm in a bar, Rosanno's...

04:04.293 --> 04:06.249
...where Cangelosi's mixing drinks.

04:06.413 --> 04:09.007
I'm making a deposit in the lavatory
when the door opens.

04:09.173 --> 04:13.644
I always lift my feet up so incoming
parties aren't aware that I'm dumping.

04:13.813 --> 04:16.406
In walks Cangelosi
with this fellow, Tony.

04:16.572 --> 04:20.361
And Tony's thanking Curtis
for some burn medicine Curtis got him.

04:20.533 --> 04:23.001
Schmoozing around
in the subsequent back-and-forth...

04:23.173 --> 04:26.290
...I can't move this bartender
for more specifics on Tony.

04:26.493 --> 04:30.884
But I hear inklings from other
acquaintances that this guy sets fires.

04:31.053 --> 04:31.253
Which strikes me a credible explanation
how his fingers got burnt.

04:31.253 --> 04:34.131
Which strikes me a credible explanation
how his fingers got burnt.

04:34.253 --> 04:36.608
And how my path
crossed here with Marshal...

04:36.733 --> 04:39.042
- Hauser.
- You want us to buy into the bartender...

04:39.173 --> 04:41.403
...and pop him.
- Buy into him for some coke...

04:41.573 --> 04:43.848
...to leverage him on ID'ing the torch.

04:44.013 --> 04:46.573
It's our homicide now.
We'll back up your undercover...

04:46.733 --> 04:48.769
...then conduct the interviews.

04:49.653 --> 04:51.928
- Who's the undercover?
- She's supposed to be here.

04:52.093 --> 04:53.492
FANCY:
Soon as she gets here, you can move.

04:53.653 --> 04:55.166
GRECO:
It's a pleasure, Arthur.

04:55.333 --> 04:57.164
SIMONE: James. James.
MARTINEZ: Yeah?

04:57.333 --> 05:00.291
- So...
- You fellows want some refreshment?

05:00.453 --> 05:02.045
- Where you going?
- What?

05:02.213 --> 05:04.852
No on the refreshments.
Very big of you to offer, though.

05:05.013 --> 05:10.087
I always look. If there's a coin cup
or something, I'm happy to contribute.

05:11.293 --> 05:13.409
You get the license of that truck
that hit you?

05:13.573 --> 05:16.804
- We were just talking to the wheel man.
- No! Lieu gave you that shiner?

05:16.973 --> 05:19.771
I'm telling you, we're supposed
to work on footwork, timing.

05:19.933 --> 05:21.889
We get in the ring
it's like World War III.

05:22.053 --> 05:24.965
- I'm boxing Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
- Did you talk to him?

05:25.133 --> 05:28.045
I'm afraid if I complain
he'll hit me again.

05:32.493 --> 05:34.688
SIPOWICZ:
Morning, sarge.

05:36.733 --> 05:40.772
Mr. And Mrs. Delgado. It's a little early.
But I guess we can head over.

05:40.933 --> 05:43.083
JOSE: I want my wife to talk
to you about the trial.

05:43.253 --> 05:45.528
SIPOWICZ: Remember, I explained.
This isn't a trial today.

05:45.693 --> 05:49.368
This is what we call the Wade hearing
on how you ID'd the suspects.

05:49.573 --> 05:53.122
- My wife is afraid.
- What are you afraid of, Mrs. Delgado?

05:53.293 --> 05:57.650
If these robbers will kill our dog just
to frighten us, what will he do to me...

05:57.813 --> 05:59.883
...if I say in court
they're the robbers?

06:00.133 --> 06:03.887
See, we couldn't prove that
Burke and Gallagher murdered the dog.

06:04.053 --> 06:07.682
It was them telling me not to testify
that they had robbed us.

06:07.853 --> 06:10.765
I believe you. I'm just saying
that we couldn't prove it.

06:10.933 --> 06:13.811
- But I went and talked to these guys.
- And we moved away.

06:13.973 --> 06:17.124
And I understand that they
haven't been in touch with you since.

06:17.413 --> 06:19.369
I'm afraid now
they will come to harm us.

06:19.533 --> 06:22.730
I reminded her what you said
about doing the right thing as citizens.

06:22.893 --> 06:26.169
But she is worried.
She doesn't want these men to find us.

06:26.453 --> 06:29.968
After the hearing, after you've
told them how you made the IDs...

06:30.133 --> 06:33.250
...in a week this case goes to trial.
If it makes you feel better...

06:33.413 --> 06:37.122
...I'll put you in a hotel until it's over.
- No. No hotel.

06:37.293 --> 06:41.571
Mrs. Delgado, this hearing's part of what
will put them in jail. Afterwards, if you...

06:41.733 --> 06:44.327
...want me to ride you home...
- No. We have a car.

06:44.533 --> 06:48.208
It's a good thing you're doing here.
You should be proud of yourself.

06:48.693 --> 06:51.491
You should be real proud
of your wife.

06:51.853 --> 06:54.287
You ready to go over there?

06:56.893 --> 06:59.327
- Okay?
- <i>VÃ¡monos.</i>

- John.

07:20.333 --> 07:22.608
John. You wearing fruit juice?

07:22.773 --> 07:26.129
I do use a scented soap by Karl
Lagerfeld, if you know who that is.

07:26.293 --> 07:29.330
No, I don't know him. But now I know
what Langerfeld smells like.

07:29.493 --> 07:30.528
JOHN:
Can I help you?

07:30.693 --> 07:34.572
Detective Russell from OCCB. I'm here
to see Fire Marshal Hauser or Lt. Fancy.

07:34.733 --> 07:38.851
The meeting's over. I'll tell them you're
in. Bobby Simone. I'm working with you.

07:39.053 --> 07:40.566
- Diane Russell.
SIMONE: Good to meet you.

07:40.733 --> 07:42.849
- Where can I change?
- Locker room's over there.

07:50.933 --> 07:53.811
- I gotta use the bathroom.
- Hold it.

When I turn around,
blink your lights if you can hear me.

that mike is on you tonight.

08:14.373 --> 08:15.692

GRECO: Hey! Booth one available?
- Hey, Vinnie.

08:24.653 --> 08:27.531
Curtis, this is my friend, Diane.
She's down from Stamford.

08:28.133 --> 08:29.964
- Pleased to meet you.
- You too.

08:31.893 --> 08:34.043
I'll have a Bloody Maria.
Make it with Gold.

08:34.212 --> 08:37.649
Curtis, no. You got that Herradura stuff,
make it with that.

08:38.133 --> 08:40.966
So, what you think of my friend?

08:41.133 --> 08:42.691
I'm very large in Connecticut.

08:42.852 --> 08:45.242
I'd say your friend deserves
better than to be here.

08:45.413 --> 08:49.326
Yeah, I know. But I wanted her to
sample the flavor of the neighborhood.

08:49.493 --> 08:53.611
I have a family function later on
over on Helston Street.

08:54.733 --> 08:56.485
GRECO: Hey, Diane.
RUSSELL: Mm?

08:56.693 --> 08:59.491
Maybe Curtis can help you out
with that quandary you got.

08:59.693 --> 09:03.163
You got a quandary, I'm the guy you
should talk to. I help a lot of people.

09:03.613 --> 09:09.245
- Bartenders take an oath. Like lifeguards.
- Vinnie, I don't even know Curtis.

09:09.413 --> 09:10.732
Well, he's a standup guy.

09:11.093 --> 09:14.768
- Aren't you a standup guy?
- Oh, yeah. All the way.

09:15.133 --> 09:17.044
- You ask him.
- Me?

09:17.613 --> 09:21.686
Diane's looking to score some blow.
You know, maybe half a lid.

09:21.853 --> 09:25.812
It's not all for me. I told my girlfriends
I could get some because Vinnie here...

09:25.973 --> 09:29.648
Come on. Come on. Yesterday my guy,
he zigs when he should've zagged.

09:29.813 --> 09:32.168
- He left us high and dry.
- I don't know.

09:33.773 --> 09:37.129
Well, if you can't, that's fine.
I don't wanna jam you up.

09:37.293 --> 09:38.567
Here.

09:38.773 --> 09:42.482
You make a decent
Bloody Maria, Curtis.

09:44.053 --> 09:45.805
I'll have another one.

09:45.973 --> 09:47.333
I guess I can make a couple of calls.

09:47.333 --> 09:48.925
I guess I can make a couple of calls.

09:49.093 --> 09:50.242
There you go, Curtis.

09:50.413 --> 09:51.766
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

09:51.933 --> 09:53.286
RUSSELL:
Cool.

09:54.333 --> 09:56.324

09:58.013 --> 10:01.562
- Number two.
- Great. Thanks.

10:21.213 --> 10:22.646
Hey.

10:23.653 --> 10:26.292
RUSSELL: You sample it?
- No. I don't use.

10:26.613 --> 10:28.012
<i>And here's your change.</i>

10:28.173 --> 10:30.209
- It's only 400.
- Ain't gonna get rich that way.

10:30.493 --> 10:32.404
Well, this was just a favor.

10:32.533 --> 10:35.809
I'm off at 8. How long do you think
your family reunion's gonna go?

10:35.933 --> 10:38.447
RUSSELL: <i>I'm not sure.</i>
GRECO: <i>What am I? Upholstery?</i>

10:38.573 --> 10:40.404
I was thinking I could buy you a drink.

10:40.533 --> 10:42.285
If I get done there then I'll stop in.

10:42.453 --> 10:44.045
I think you made an impression.

10:44.213 --> 10:47.489
- This is my number at the bar and home.
- Okay, thanks.

10:47.653 --> 10:51.202
CURTIS: If it doesn't work out for
tonight, I could drive up to Stamford.

10:51.333 --> 10:53.085
I know a place
with good Bloody Marias.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.767
- All right. Thanks, Curtis.
- The man's in love!

10:55.933 --> 10:58.242
- Curtis, be good!
- Yeah. I'll see you, Vinnie.

10:58.413 --> 11:01.052
- Here we go.
SIMONE: Let's take him in.

11:06.013 --> 11:08.811
SIMONE: Curtis, police officers.
You're under arrest. Don't move.

11:08.973 --> 11:10.645
- What for?
SIMONE: Put your hands up here.

11:10.813 --> 11:14.249
- We'll talk about it at the station house.
- What did I do?

11:15.733 --> 11:17.610
SIMONE: Here.
CURTIS: What did I do?

11:18.573 --> 11:20.768
SIMONE:
Come on, let's go.

11:30.373 --> 11:33.893
DA's agreed not to charge him
on the sale if Cangelosi cooperates.

11:34.133 --> 11:36.408
- He'll deal.
- Yeah, he should. He's no hard-ass.

11:36.693 --> 11:38.729
How do we know
Cangelosi's the wrong guy?

11:38.893 --> 11:42.681
- That's what I got from the informant.
- I checked with BCI. He's got no record.

11:42.853 --> 11:45.925
- Maybe he beat us a few times.
- No arrests. Not even a speeding ticket.

11:46.093 --> 11:48.766
Record or no record,
we got a homicide to clear.

11:48.933 --> 11:52.289
If Cangelosi's clean, like you say,
I'm sure he'll cooperate.

11:52.413 --> 11:55.883
What if he doesn't? Then we've
put a felony on a legitimate guy.

11:56.013 --> 11:58.004
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
- I'm not.

11:58.133 --> 12:00.522
I don't like turning innocent
people into criminals.

12:00.653 --> 12:04.328
How many model citizens can get
half an ounce of coke in 20 minutes?

12:04.453 --> 12:07.490
If he cooperates, fine.
But if he doesn't give the other guy up...

12:07.613 --> 12:11.526
...I won't testify against him at a trial.
- Now that we know your future plans...

12:11.653 --> 12:17.364
...how about you and Detective Simone
flip him so we don't end up in that box.

12:22.213 --> 12:26.047
Right in here. I don't think I'm gonna
give you too many lines at this interview.

12:26.213 --> 12:28.090
That's a good idea.

12:28.253 --> 12:33.168
SIMONE: Because, well, you might pull
your piece and try to break this guy out.

12:35.333 --> 12:37.130
You okay?

12:43.213 --> 12:46.410
So like I told you before, you can have
an attorney here if you want.

12:46.573 --> 12:50.691
But before you decide, I'll tell you what
we got and how you can help yourself.

12:50.853 --> 12:54.562
I told you, I've never sold drugs
in my life. I don't even use.

12:54.733 --> 12:58.567
- Yeah, well you sold today.
- I did you a favor! I can't believe this.

12:58.733 --> 13:01.372
- I get picked up for doing a favor?
- You call it a favor.

13:01.493 --> 13:03.290
We call it one to three
in penitentiary.

13:03.493 --> 13:05.688
I don't believe this.

13:06.133 --> 13:08.283
Why'd you do this to me?

13:08.493 --> 13:11.610
You wanna know what happened?
I'll tell you what happened.

13:11.773 --> 13:16.449
She walked into the bar, her and that
Vinnie. Was he part of setting me up?

13:16.573 --> 13:18.052
SIMONE:
Vinnie's in custody.

13:18.173 --> 13:21.722
Anyways, she gives me a sob story. She
needs some cocaine for her girlfriends.

13:21.893 --> 13:25.602
And I guess Vinnie was doing her
a favor. So I tried to do her a favor.

13:25.773 --> 13:29.652
I make a phone call. Then she wants me
to go with her because she's scared.

13:29.853 --> 13:32.447
Then she wants me to take
the money to give to the guy.

13:32.773 --> 13:36.322
I do everything she asks. I don't take
a cent. I give her 100 change...

13:36.493 --> 13:38.961
...because I'm such a big dealer.
And I walked away.

13:39.173 --> 13:41.528
Yeah. That's how it happened.
That's a felony.

13:41.693 --> 13:43.888
All right. You help us out...

13:44.773 --> 13:48.402
...and maybe we're
in a position to help you.

13:48.573 --> 13:50.643
Maybe you're looking
at a suspended sentence.

13:50.813 --> 13:52.644
Come on, sit down.

13:55.813 --> 13:56.928
CURTIS:
Help you out how?

13:57.093 --> 13:58.446
SIMONE:
There's a guy who committed a crime...

13:58.613 --> 14:01.446
...that resulted in a death.
You can help us make our case.

14:01.613 --> 14:04.764
- What guy?
- Tony, who burned his hand last week.

14:04.973 --> 14:07.646
Tony Medici? He sells miniblinds.

14:07.813 --> 14:11.203
When he came in with his hands burned
that night, when you brought him...

14:11.373 --> 14:15.605
...burn medicine, he burned his hands
torching a building. Now, a fireman died.

14:15.773 --> 14:18.526
That's murder, Curtis.
That's what your friend, Tony, did.

14:18.733 --> 14:20.325
He said it was a hot water heater.

14:20.493 --> 14:23.405
We want you to get Tony talking
on tape about the fires he set.

14:23.613 --> 14:25.922
That's your way out of this.

14:26.653 --> 14:29.247
I'm not gonna set up
a friend of mine.

14:29.853 --> 14:32.925
- That's what you do, not me.
- Now, you're in a situation here.

14:33.133 --> 14:37.524
Your way out is to cooperate. Now if it
turns out that Tony didn't do it and...

14:37.693 --> 14:40.730
...you cooperated so that we could
find that out, I think you'd...

14:40.893 --> 14:43.123
...still be looking at a walk.

14:43.693 --> 14:47.368
I'm gonna give you a little time to think
about this. You want something to eat?

14:47.533 --> 14:49.728
We'll get you something.

15:00.933 --> 15:04.562
- Going over to Ray's. Want something?
- Yeah, I want their entire menu.

15:04.733 --> 15:09.170
The answer's no. I gotta lose
a couple pounds for this wedding.

15:09.333 --> 15:11.563
JOHN:
Detective, line two.

15:14.533 --> 15:16.251
SIPOWICZ:
Sipowicz.

15:18.693 --> 15:23.483
All right. All right, take it easy. Take it
easy, Mr. Delgado. I'll be right there.

15:24.173 --> 15:28.564
James, those sons of bitches
grabbed that woman.

16:26.333 --> 16:30.372
JOSE:
Consuelo! Consuelo!

16:30.533 --> 16:33.001
[CRYING]

16:48.493 --> 16:50.609
SIMONE:
Here you go.

16:53.653 --> 16:54.802
Come on.

16:54.933 --> 16:56.969
You gonna tell if I have
another wine cooler?

16:57.093 --> 16:58.412
Hey, I didn't see anything.

16:58.573 --> 17:01.645
- I don't mean to put you in a position.
- You're not.

17:04.373 --> 17:06.603
How long you been doing this?

17:08.252 --> 17:10.403
Three years.

17:10.573 --> 17:13.565
I used to work undercover
on a couple of cases.

17:13.733 --> 17:16.724
It was just for
a couple of days at a time.

17:16.933 --> 17:19.731
I know it's different when
you have a permanent assignment.

17:20.173 --> 17:23.563
- It grinds being under all the time.
- Yeah.

17:24.613 --> 17:27.685
I didn't mind taking down bad guys,
even the ones I liked.

17:27.813 --> 17:29.610
I took them down too.

17:29.933 --> 17:34.370
But then after a while
you just start asking yourself...

17:34.533 --> 17:37.605
...how much of what these guys
have done is my doing?

17:37.773 --> 17:41.448
I mean, would they even be here
if I didn't put them here? And...

17:42.093 --> 17:43.924
I don't know.

17:44.253 --> 17:47.404
And then something like this.
A totally legitimate guy.

17:47.613 --> 17:51.162
See, look.
I think this guy's not gonna go down.

17:51.333 --> 17:54.450
- Seriously. I think he's gonna help us.
- Well...

17:54.613 --> 17:57.446
If he does, he's gonna help me,
because...

17:57.733 --> 18:01.646
...I'll go on suspension before I go
on the witness stand against this guy.

18:02.133 --> 18:04.249
Enough's enough.

18:05.933 --> 18:07.810
We should get back.

18:33.253 --> 18:35.050
Have a seat.

18:35.653 --> 18:39.328
- Have a slice.
- No, I can't eat.

18:39.653 --> 18:42.121
So you and this Tony go way back?

18:42.293 --> 18:44.887
We were kids
in the same neighborhood.

18:45.293 --> 18:48.490
When you were talking about him,
it reminded me of a buddy of mine.

18:48.773 --> 18:51.845
This guy from the neighborhood.
We were tight when we were kids.

18:52.013 --> 18:56.404
About a couple of months back,
he gets all jammed up. So I help him out.

18:56.573 --> 18:59.371
A week later, he's in another jam.

18:59.533 --> 19:03.924
Curtis, I had to realize that
he was not the kid I knew anymore.

19:04.293 --> 19:05.931
I'm not gonna wear a wire.

19:06.253 --> 19:08.892
- We understand that.
- You're trying to do the right thing.

19:09.053 --> 19:11.647
- We all wanna do that.
- How's what you did to me right?

19:11.813 --> 19:14.805
SIMONE: We can all disagree
about what happened to you.

19:14.933 --> 19:18.130
But let me tell you right now.
You don't have to end up in jail.

19:18.293 --> 19:20.853
Now, we're doing what we can
to see that doesn't happen.

19:21.133 --> 19:23.647
But I want you to think
about something.

19:23.813 --> 19:26.725
An innocent man
was killed in this fire.

19:26.893 --> 19:30.568
He died for doing his job.
Now this buddy of yours, Tony.

19:30.733 --> 19:33.566
He told you what? He burned his
hands on a hot water heater?

19:33.733 --> 19:36.611
- Right? You believe that?
- Yeah, I do.

19:36.773 --> 19:38.889
If you went and you talked to him...

19:39.053 --> 19:43.490
...and you felt differently about how he
got those burns, then I'd expect you...

19:43.653 --> 19:47.532
...to feel different about talking. You
don't have to get wired or give him up.

19:47.693 --> 19:51.288
All I'm saying is that you might think
differently about giving up an address.

19:51.453 --> 19:55.332
On the other hand, you walk out that
door there and happen to see Tony.

19:55.493 --> 19:58.451
And you're convinced that he has
nothing to do with this...

19:58.573 --> 20:00.484
...then I won't
expect to see you again.

20:00.653 --> 20:02.883
What do you mean
when I walk out that door?

20:03.053 --> 20:06.728
- Are you letting me go?
- There's no charges filed against you.

20:06.933 --> 20:09.970
I'm not saying there won't be.
They might decide to file later on.

20:10.133 --> 20:12.966
But for right now, yeah.
You're free to go.

20:13.693 --> 20:17.811
I don't know what exactly
you want.

20:19.013 --> 20:22.847
I want you to do what your
conscience tells you to do.

20:25.413 --> 20:28.962
You don't want that pizza,
you're free to go.

20:37.453 --> 20:40.490
- That took guts.
SIMONE: I took a shot, right?

20:40.653 --> 20:42.325
HAUSER:
How do you let that guy walk?

20:42.493 --> 20:44.768
What? You want this guy
in the joint or his buddy?

20:44.933 --> 20:46.730
- We had leverage.
- No, we had squat.

20:46.893 --> 20:50.522
That's a legitimate guy. Back him against
the wall, I guarantee he'd do time...

20:50.693 --> 20:54.242
...before giving up his friend. I know
that you lost one of your own here.

20:54.413 --> 20:58.042
I'm trying to make it work and this is
how we do it. If he doesn't come back...

20:58.213 --> 21:01.489
...you wanna reinstate charges,
that's still a way we can go.

21:01.773 --> 21:04.765
- You let me know what breaks.
SIMONE: Absolutely.

21:10.933 --> 21:13.288
Why don't we go get a beer?

21:13.453 --> 21:16.763
Then I can decide how I feel
about you saving my career here.

21:17.253 --> 21:20.802
- Bobby, give me a hand with something?
- Yeah. Excuse me. What's up?

21:21.173 --> 21:25.325
Martinez and me found the
Delgado woman's body all burned up.

21:25.493 --> 21:28.405
Her teeth were all snapped out
and her fingertips were cut off.

21:28.613 --> 21:32.401
Burke and Gallagher, those bastards she
was testifying against grabbed her up.

21:32.573 --> 21:34.370
- You wanna go sit on their houses?
SIPOWICZ: Yeah.

21:34.533 --> 21:35.932
Yeah.

21:36.253 --> 21:38.164
- Another time?
- No problem.

21:38.333 --> 21:40.893
- Nice working with you.
SIMONE: Yeah.

21:43.173 --> 21:46.131
- Give me a second. I'm gonna piss.
- All right.

21:48.133 --> 21:52.763
I had her husband make her testify.
That was her duty as a citizen.

22:27.213 --> 22:29.408
- Thanks for going out there.
- Hey, no problem.

22:29.573 --> 22:31.404
Do you need any help
on these interviews?

22:31.573 --> 22:35.486
No. I know these guys
from working up the original case.

22:42.733 --> 22:45.884
- Morning, marshal.
- Lf we can't get to the torch through...

22:46.053 --> 22:49.489
...the bartender, I say we set up
a circumstantial arson for profit case...

22:49.653 --> 22:52.247
...against the building owner.
- Don't quit on the torch.

22:52.413 --> 22:55.052
- And don't quit on the bartender.
- I'm not relying on him.

22:55.213 --> 22:57.010
- I've found my own way to the torch.
- Oh, yeah?

22:57.173 --> 23:00.768
Building owner's name is Martin Lasky.
I ran a TRW check on the case...

23:00.933 --> 23:05.085
...documenting all fire losses claimed by
him and other fires in the past 10 years.

23:05.453 --> 23:09.048
I rechecked last night, and one of the
other buildings is a joint ownership...

23:09.213 --> 23:12.762
...with a guy named Leo Medici.
This Tony's his nephew.

23:12.933 --> 23:15.163
We're sitting on a couple spots
trying to pick him up.

23:15.333 --> 23:18.643
See, I ran a BCI check on Tony
last night and he's got no record.

23:19.013 --> 23:20.048
What're you telling me?

23:20.213 --> 23:23.330
- You don't think he's the torch?
- I'm just giving you information.

23:23.493 --> 23:26.132
- Come on, let's get a cup of coffee.
- No, it's okay.

23:26.613 --> 23:28.524
I know where it's at.

23:32.453 --> 23:34.808
- Good morning, John.
- Hey.

23:34.973 --> 23:36.929
Can you...?

23:37.533 --> 23:39.693
- Can you get me that OCCB number?
- Sure. One second.

23:39.693 --> 23:42.207
- Can you get me that OCCB number?
- Sure. One second.

23:42.813 --> 23:46.010
- Hey. How's it going?
- All right.

23:46.333 --> 23:48.563
SIMONE: I thought you'd be
working on something else.

23:48.733 --> 23:50.849
Well, my boss thought you might
want me to make another buy.

23:51.013 --> 23:54.801
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. That's what I told him.

23:56.653 --> 23:58.484
Have a seat.

24:00.373 --> 24:03.092
Looks like we have another way
of getting to this torch.

24:03.413 --> 24:05.449
What? If Curtis doesn't come back?

24:05.613 --> 24:09.322
- Detective, you want the OCCB number?
- No, John. Thanks.

24:10.253 --> 24:12.847
You know someone else at OCCB?

24:13.133 --> 24:15.806
No. Just you.

24:18.413 --> 24:20.369
That female undercover's
got some moxie.

24:20.733 --> 24:26.524
Yeah. Yeah. I'd be happy to pick her up
if they'd let her out of her detail.

24:26.693 --> 24:30.686
Checked with her command. She's had
a 57 in for the last couple of months...

24:30.853 --> 24:34.163
...trying to get out of undercover.
- I'll check with the chief of D's.

24:34.333 --> 24:36.972
See if it's gotta be a one for one.

24:40.493 --> 24:42.051
I got him if you wanna go change.

24:42.213 --> 24:43.646
MEDAVO Y: Yeah, all right.
- Thanks, Greg.

24:43.813 --> 24:45.531
MEDAVO Y:
Yeah, no problem.

24:49.973 --> 24:51.929
Stand up.

24:56.093 --> 24:58.846
How'd you get that mud
on your clothes?

24:59.173 --> 25:02.324
BURKE: This? I don't know.
- Get your clothes off.

25:03.693 --> 25:07.572
Get your clothes off
and put them on that chair.

25:09.493 --> 25:11.370
Pants too.

25:16.013 --> 25:18.891
Police labs are gonna
analyze that dirt.

25:19.053 --> 25:22.284
They'll pinpoint
exactly where it comes from.

25:22.493 --> 25:24.927
If it comes from where
that woman got burned...

25:25.133 --> 25:26.771
No.

25:26.933 --> 25:29.572
Did Gallagher kill that woman's dog?

25:29.733 --> 25:33.248
That's a separate matter. There's no
charges on that. Just tell me the truth.

25:33.413 --> 25:35.722
- No. No, he didn't.
- Did Gallagher kill that dog...

25:35.893 --> 25:39.681
...to frighten the Delgados so Mrs.
Delgado wouldn't testify on seeing...

25:39.853 --> 25:42.128
...you guys rob her house?
- No.

25:42.333 --> 25:46.008
I'm giving you a chance
to help yourself!

25:46.213 --> 25:49.649
Did Gallagher kill that woman like
he killed that dog to stop her from...

25:49.813 --> 25:54.568
...testifying against him in the trial?
- No, no. He didn't do it. It wasn't him.

25:54.733 --> 25:58.169
- And we wasn't scared of no trial.
- Who told you not to be scared?

25:58.653 --> 25:59.722
It wasn't Gallagher.

25:59.893 --> 26:02.805
It was him! And you believe
everything he tells you to believe.

26:02.973 --> 26:05.487
And you would do everything
that he tells you to do!

26:05.653 --> 26:07.609
- I don't always do what he tells me.
- Yeah?

26:07.773 --> 26:10.412
When was the last time
you said no?

26:11.773 --> 26:14.003
Never mind.

26:20.373 --> 26:24.366
Let me tell you something, Burke.
You and I both know Gallagher is smart.

26:24.533 --> 26:28.492
We both know before anything happens
to him, it's gonna happen to you.

26:28.653 --> 26:32.043
Now, he'll set you up to be the patsy
on this. Before that happens...

26:32.213 --> 26:35.364
...you had better get some smarts
of your own.

26:50.013 --> 26:51.002
[DOOR OPENS]

27:04.653 --> 27:06.609
You know what this is about, right?

27:06.773 --> 27:09.412
I'm not saying nothing because
I haven't done nothing.

27:09.573 --> 27:12.690
It's not about what you've done.
It's about what Burke did.

27:12.853 --> 27:16.687
- I don't know nothing about that.
- I'm opening the door for you, Gallagher.

27:16.853 --> 27:20.209
Your friend's got half a brain.
You strike me like you're smart enough...

27:20.373 --> 27:22.933
...to step through the door
I'm opening for you.

27:23.093 --> 27:24.572
And what door's that?

27:24.733 --> 27:29.249
Burke had dirt from the lot where that
woman got burned all over his clothes.

27:29.453 --> 27:33.048
We know what he did to that woman
and we know that you were with him.

27:33.213 --> 27:34.202
I haven't seen him.

27:34.373 --> 27:38.446
I got evidence that puts you at the scene
where Mrs. Delgado got murdered.

27:38.613 --> 27:41.252
I got a witness that saw you and Burke
shove her in a car.

27:41.413 --> 27:44.610
Didn't see me. I wasn't there.
I haven't seen Burke!

27:44.773 --> 27:49.164
Listen to me.
I look at you, and I look at Burke.

27:49.293 --> 27:53.650
Burke's got that dirt all over his clothes
and on his hands. You got no dirt at all.

27:53.813 --> 27:55.565
Who do you think I think did this crime?

27:55.733 --> 27:57.849
If you know he did it,
what do you need me for?

27:58.013 --> 27:59.924
I need a witness.

28:00.133 --> 28:02.089
And that'd be me?

28:02.253 --> 28:04.562
You want me to be a witness
to what Burke did.

28:04.733 --> 28:08.772
Did you see him kill her, Gallagher?
I'm trying to save your life on this.

28:08.933 --> 28:12.448
You think I'm a moron like him? You
think I'm gonna put myself at the scene?

28:12.653 --> 28:17.010
As a witness. I'm asking for
a witness statement. Not a confession.

28:17.893 --> 28:21.442
A witness statement. Sure.

28:21.853 --> 28:24.287
Like I don't know what
acting in concert means.

28:24.453 --> 28:27.411
Like I don't know just being there
puts me away too.

28:27.933 --> 28:31.608
I'm dealing with a real first-rate
mind, aren't I?

28:32.653 --> 28:34.883
Good enough for you.

28:35.333 --> 28:36.527
- Hey, James?
MARTINEZ: Yeah?

28:36.693 --> 28:38.524
FANCY: Can I talk to you a minute?
MARTINEZ: Sure, lieu.

28:38.693 --> 28:41.048
I think I'm gonna take a pass
on sparring tonight.

28:41.213 --> 28:43.727
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. In fact, James, my schedule's...

28:43.893 --> 28:46.930
...getting pretty crowded.
We better pass on working out together.

28:47.093 --> 28:49.323
- All right. If that's what you want.
- Yeah.

28:49.493 --> 28:53.088
- Thanks for working out with me.
- I'm sorry it got rough a few times.

28:53.253 --> 28:56.563
We're different weight classes. You
probably don't know your strength.

28:56.973 --> 29:00.761
To tell you the truth, lieu, I sometimes
felt like you got a little carried away.

29:00.933 --> 29:03.925
Well, I don't disagree.
I don't think we should keep sparring.

29:04.093 --> 29:05.765
Okay. That's no problem.

29:06.453 --> 29:09.843
Hey, James. You need a manager?

29:10.933 --> 29:13.970
Oh, detective, there's a Curtis Cangelosi
downstairs. He wants to talk to you.

29:14.133 --> 29:15.646
[PHONE RINGS]

29:15.813 --> 29:18.247
JOHN: 15th Detective Squad.
Can I help you?

29:18.613 --> 29:22.049
Hey, where were you? Cangelosi.

29:29.253 --> 29:31.892
- How's it going, Curtis?
- Yeah, I'm back.

29:32.053 --> 29:34.931
- And I talked with my friend.
- Come on upstairs and we'll talk.

29:35.093 --> 29:36.685
Am I under arrest?

29:36.853 --> 29:40.050
No. We just wanted to hear
what you got to say, that's all.

29:40.213 --> 29:43.728
You know how wrong you guys are? All
the grief you gave me was for nothing.

29:43.893 --> 29:44.962
What did Tony tell you?

29:45.133 --> 29:47.169
CURTIS:
He was at that fire. You know why?

29:47.333 --> 29:50.245
He was yelling for people
in the apartment next door to get out.

29:50.413 --> 29:53.211
So why'd he tell you
he got burned by a water heater?

29:55.173 --> 29:56.891
He didn't tell me how he got burned.

29:57.053 --> 30:01.410
He just said he had an accident. I made
it up before about the hot water heater.

30:01.573 --> 30:05.361
Why'd he lie to you about those burns?
Unless he didn't wanna put himself...

30:05.533 --> 30:08.730
...at the crime at all because maybe
he didn't just happen by there.

30:08.893 --> 30:12.602
Maybe he was there with his trusty
gasoline can like uncle asked him to be.

30:12.773 --> 30:14.525
That's not what happened.

30:14.693 --> 30:18.242
This guy's my friend. And he explained
what he was doing there.

30:18.413 --> 30:20.131
Curtis.

30:20.533 --> 30:23.047
What'd he say when you told him
we were talking to you?

30:23.213 --> 30:26.922
That's when he explained. And I'll tell
you, after the ride you people gave me...

30:27.093 --> 30:29.004
...I understand why
he didn't go near you.

30:29.173 --> 30:32.927
Now, are you filing charges against me?

30:33.133 --> 30:36.364
No. No one's filed charges
against you yet, Curtis.

30:36.773 --> 30:39.048
Thanks for your cooperation.

30:42.253 --> 30:44.244
I'm out of here.

30:49.213 --> 30:52.091
- You back here again?
- Yeah. I told them, Tony.

30:52.253 --> 30:54.209
I told them why you were there.

31:01.453 --> 31:03.648
All right, thanks, guys.

31:03.893 --> 31:07.681
I'm Detective Simone. Tony, this
is Fire Marshal Hauser, Detective Russell.

31:07.853 --> 31:11.050
Your name was brought up in an
investigation into a fire last week...

31:11.173 --> 31:12.765
...on 7th Street.
- In what regard?

31:12.933 --> 31:13.968
Your uncle, Leo...

31:14.133 --> 31:16.044
...he's the owner of that building?
- No.

31:16.213 --> 31:18.249
He's partners with Martin Lasky
on some other buildings Lasky owns.

31:18.413 --> 31:19.402
TONY:
So what?

31:19.573 --> 31:23.771
We got you at the scene leaving that
building at the time the fires broke out.

31:23.933 --> 31:26.606
You guys brought back
Curtis Cangelosi again?

31:27.333 --> 31:30.211
- You the girl he tried to help out?
- Listen to me, here, Tony.

31:30.373 --> 31:32.329
What are you trying to
do to this poor mutt?

31:32.493 --> 31:33.721
I wouldn't call him a mutt.

31:33.893 --> 31:36.612
- He stood up for you.
- He explain what I was doing?

31:36.773 --> 31:40.322
You were walking by your uncle's
building when it just happened...

31:40.453 --> 31:43.525
...to catch on fire. And you burned
your hands knocking on doors...

31:43.653 --> 31:45.769
...warning people.
- That makes me a bad guy?

31:45.893 --> 31:48.202
No, it just makes you a bad arsonist.

31:48.373 --> 31:51.171
That fire must've gone up
before you were ready.

31:52.773 --> 31:54.764
All right. Here's what happened.

31:54.933 --> 31:59.370
One time. I'm standing out front of my
house which was downwind that night.

31:59.533 --> 32:01.569
I smell smoke. I see flames.

32:01.733 --> 32:04.645
I go over as quick as I can,
see if I can get some people out.

32:04.813 --> 32:08.567
Being there like that, you could
have helped out on that investigation.

32:08.693 --> 32:12.049
I'm sorry. I didn't see nothing. When I
get there the place is half gone.

32:12.213 --> 32:15.011
How is it that you got your hands
burned then, Tony? Exactly.

32:15.573 --> 32:18.212
I fell after kicking down
a door. I don't know what I hit.

32:18.373 --> 32:21.604
You didn't get them dropping a match
into a pool of gasoline?

32:21.773 --> 32:25.368
I came down here with those guys.
I thought maybe I could be of some help.

32:25.533 --> 32:27.888
But I can see
that's not gonna be the case.

32:28.053 --> 32:31.728
- Wait a minute. Where you going?
- What? Am I under arrest?

32:31.893 --> 32:34.168
No. Get out of here.

32:50.733 --> 32:52.530
You want something
to eat now, Burke?

32:53.053 --> 32:57.205
They get you down there, it might
be a while before you're near any food.

32:57.373 --> 32:59.807
- Get down where?
- Come on, Burke.

32:59.973 --> 33:04.603
Gallagher did just what we knew he was
gonna do. He gave you to us all the way.

33:04.973 --> 33:09.046
I'll tell you,
he's got a nice eye for detail.

33:09.253 --> 33:11.972
How you cut off the dog's head
and put it on the porch...

33:12.133 --> 33:13.566
...with him asking you not to.

33:13.733 --> 33:17.089
Chopping off that woman's fingers
while she was still alive.

33:17.253 --> 33:21.041
Knocking her teeth out while she's
screaming all the time for mercy.

33:21.213 --> 33:23.124
- That's headline stuff, Burke!
- No, no, no.

33:23.293 --> 33:26.968
That's gonna earn you an injection
courtesy of my hero, Governor Pataki.

33:27.133 --> 33:28.122
He's lying!

33:28.293 --> 33:29.487
SIPOWICZ:
You know they do it by injection?

33:29.653 --> 33:33.248
- Just like at the vet.
- He's lying. He's lying! Wait, wait, wait.

33:34.733 --> 33:37.372
If I knocked her teeth out,
you should go ask Gallagher...

33:37.533 --> 33:40.889
...why he's got that lady's gold teeth
in his apartment!

33:44.613 --> 33:47.002
Where in his apartment?

33:47.293 --> 33:51.172
He knocked her teeth out
and he has them in a coffee can.

33:59.253 --> 34:00.447
SIPOWICZ:
Lieutenant.

34:00.773 --> 34:05.005
That half-wit, Burke, says Mrs. Delgado's
teeth are over at Gallagher's apartment.

34:05.173 --> 34:07.448
That would give us enough
corroboration to arrest.

34:07.613 --> 34:09.649
I'm gonna get a search
warrant authorization.

34:09.813 --> 34:13.248
I understand. All right. Whatever
you can do to help me out on this. Okay.

34:13.413 --> 34:15.130
I gotta get back to you.

34:15.293 --> 34:17.090
Hey, what's going on, Curtis?

34:17.253 --> 34:19.322
- I wanna tell you something.
- Sure, sit down.

34:19.493 --> 34:23.565
I'm gonna tell you something. I want
you to tell Tony Medici something.

34:23.733 --> 34:25.724
- Ask him a question.
- What's that?

34:25.893 --> 34:28.088
- What?
- What do you want me to ask him?

34:28.293 --> 34:32.002
- You ask him this. You ask...
- Come on.

34:33.132 --> 34:34.725
You ask him...

34:34.893 --> 34:38.851
Maybe I am a loser. Maybe I'll never
be anything more than a bartender.

34:39.293 --> 34:43.002
What difference does it make where
a loser like me makes drinks, right?

34:43.172 --> 34:47.530
But you ask him this.
A, I never threatened a friend...

34:47.693 --> 34:50.844
...or called him a moron,
or told him that his life was garbage.

34:51.013 --> 34:54.130
- Did Tony come to see you, Curtis?
- Because I don't have to think...

34:54.293 --> 34:57.729
...that my life is a waste,
is number one.

34:57.893 --> 35:01.488
I mean, it's pretty obvious that
I don't always see every angle, right?

35:01.653 --> 35:05.726
I didn't know your pretty lady friend
was a cop, and I tried to help her out.

35:05.893 --> 35:11.206
And I got hung up for that. And now
I get called a 5-dollar-an-hour loser...

35:11.373 --> 35:15.286
...and told I gotta leave town
because I did someone a favor.

35:15.413 --> 35:17.483
And he thinks
I'm trying to jam him up.

35:17.613 --> 35:19.046
Screw him! And screw New York!

35:19.213 --> 35:21.124
What happened, Curtis?
Did he threaten you?

35:21.293 --> 35:23.090
I'll tell you something.

35:23.253 --> 35:27.804
I've been in several cities that I like as
good as New York with better weather.

35:27.973 --> 35:30.931
And you tell him...
You tell him...

35:31.053 --> 35:32.611
...if I'm such a loser...

35:32.733 --> 35:36.248
...how come I'm gonna be tending bar
someplace where he can't find me...

35:36.373 --> 35:39.126
...and he is where he is
because of what him and his uncle did.

35:39.293 --> 35:42.251
Curtis, what did he say?

35:42.773 --> 35:47.722
Let's just say that I don't really believe
that he was there by accident.

35:47.893 --> 35:50.851
His uncle wasn't out of town.

35:51.053 --> 35:54.733
This time he said his uncle nearly died
in that fire. He saved his uncle's life.

35:54.733 --> 35:55.210
This time he said his uncle nearly died
in that fire. He saved his uncle's life.

35:55.373 --> 35:58.843
- That's gonna help us, Curtis.
- I don't wanna help anybody.

35:59.373 --> 36:01.728
That's how I get in trouble.

36:09.813 --> 36:10.802
What was that?

36:10.973 --> 36:14.648
The torch's uncle was supposedly out of
town. It's hearsay, but our bartender...

36:14.813 --> 36:17.373
...got him in town, at the fire,
with his hands burned.

36:17.533 --> 36:19.763
- You got an address on the uncle?
- Yeah.

36:19.933 --> 36:22.891
- Then let's pick him up.
- Let's go.

36:39.893 --> 36:45.047
I read about people like you
in books. Evil geniuses.

36:45.613 --> 36:47.490
I'll tell you the truth.

36:47.613 --> 36:50.525
I walked out of here before,
I went to the lavatory and wept.

36:50.653 --> 36:54.089
That's how confused you had me.
I'd be trying to move you.

36:54.253 --> 36:58.292
I'd come around the corner and there
you were, seven steps ahead of me.

36:58.453 --> 37:01.411
- When am I gonna get out of here?
- No, you don't get out.

37:01.573 --> 37:03.928
You don't get out, Gallagher.

37:04.253 --> 37:07.051
- Then I want a lawyer.
- Absolutely.

37:07.213 --> 37:11.525
I'm gonna get you one of our top legal
aid guys with gravy stains on his shirt.

37:11.693 --> 37:16.721
And I don't want you to say a word
or jeopardize your constitutional rights.

37:16.893 --> 37:19.726
Because a fellow like you...

37:19.933 --> 37:24.643
...that'll murder and burn a woman,
cut the head off her dog...

37:24.813 --> 37:27.486
...knock her teeth out,
cut her fingers off...

37:27.653 --> 37:30.213
...so she won't say
how you broke into her house...

37:30.373 --> 37:33.649
...where her and her husband
are trying to live a decent life!

37:33.813 --> 37:38.125
A great man like you, Gallagher!
A huge genius!

37:38.293 --> 37:42.286
To only be tripped up because
besides being a scumbag psycho...

37:42.453 --> 37:44.330
...you're a cheap piece of crap!

37:44.453 --> 37:48.924
And you keep this poor woman's
gold teeth in an old coffee can!

37:49.053 --> 37:52.363
I want you to take full advantage
of our legal resource!

37:52.573 --> 37:55.406
Now, you utter no word
until your lawyer gets here!

37:55.573 --> 37:59.691
All I want you to do is stare
at this tooth that you gouged...

37:59.853 --> 38:03.607
...out of this woman's mouth.
Are you looking at this, Gallagher?

38:03.813 --> 38:05.849
Gallagher, are you looking at this?

38:06.013 --> 38:09.449
Do not say one word.
You just nod your head.

38:09.693 --> 38:12.605
Are you looking at it, Gallagher?

38:18.333 --> 38:22.531
I'm gonna get a migraine tonight
because I didn't beat you.

38:38.613 --> 38:42.049
Hey, Bobby. You need any help
with the online booking report?

38:42.213 --> 38:44.090
SIMONE:
No. Thanks. I'm almost done.

38:44.813 --> 38:47.486
- Taking off?
- Yeah. I think so.

38:47.693 --> 38:50.446
Yeah. I'm gonna take off
as soon as I finish here.

38:51.053 --> 38:53.521
Well, if you can wait 10 minutes, maybe
we could grab some dinner together?

38:53.693 --> 38:57.402
- Sure. I got 10 minutes.
- Great.

38:59.373 --> 39:02.251
Why am I sitting here?
I go so far back with the lieutenant.

39:02.453 --> 39:04.523
You realize how far back
I go with this guy?

39:04.693 --> 39:06.285
He said you wait.

39:06.653 --> 39:09.725
Since before you got your tushy
pinched, that's how far back I go.

39:09.893 --> 39:12.646
- Do I have you thrown out?
- I'm sorry.

39:12.813 --> 39:13.848
FANCY:
Vinnie? In the hall.

39:14.013 --> 39:17.289
GRECO: Lieutenant, please.
You do me the courtesy here?

39:17.773 --> 39:22.927
I hear there's been a break in the case.
Tony and his uncle are being questioned?

39:23.133 --> 39:25.601
Yeah. It looks good.
It'll take a few days to develop.

39:25.773 --> 39:29.482
That's good. Maybe you could talk to the
relevant parties, put in a good word?

39:29.653 --> 39:32.292
- You got yours.
- I got for my initial impetus.

39:32.453 --> 39:35.286
Not for my specific contribution
in light of the happy ending.

39:35.453 --> 39:37.967
- I'll try to get you another taste.
- Okay, maybe today?

39:38.133 --> 39:42.888
- When it wraps, Vinnie.
- Thanks, lieu. Good, good. Very grateful.

39:49.693 --> 39:51.843
Okay. Good, James. Again.

39:54.053 --> 39:59.081
Again. Now cross. Now set up your
right with your second jab. Come on!

39:59.253 --> 40:01.369
That's what I'm trying to do.

40:01.773 --> 40:03.525
- There you go!
- I just did that!

40:03.693 --> 40:06.446
- Except this time you were pissed off.
- I'm sorry.

40:06.613 --> 40:09.810
No. James, you gotta be pissed off.
This is the one place it's okay.

40:09.973 --> 40:11.770
- I know that.
- But you don't do it.

40:11.933 --> 40:15.528
You're not gonna believe it, but I signed
up for the tournament to have fun.

40:15.693 --> 40:18.412
If I have to get mad,
maybe I should be off riding my bike.

40:18.573 --> 40:22.248
The guy that's smacking the crap out of
you won't be thinking of riding no bike.

40:22.373 --> 40:25.092
He'll be thinking of that trophy on his
squad room's wall...

40:25.213 --> 40:27.522
...while you're on the canvass.
You wanna do this?

40:27.653 --> 40:29.405
- Yeah.
- Otherwise, get on your Schwinn.

40:29.533 --> 40:30.602
I said I wanna do it!

40:30.773 --> 40:34.322
Then show me something!
Double up and cross.

40:34.493 --> 40:36.245
All right.

40:36.733 --> 40:39.372
All right, better. Come on.

40:39.533 --> 40:41.888
Yeah. That's more like it.

40:53.373 --> 40:56.126
He probably
would've left town anyway.

40:56.453 --> 40:59.570
The bartender. Cangelosi.

41:00.213 --> 41:01.851
Yeah.

41:02.053 --> 41:03.930
Yeah, I think he probably would.

41:10.533 --> 41:12.444
It's late.

41:15.053 --> 41:17.123
Does that matter?

41:17.493 --> 41:19.961
Because it doesn't matter to me.

41:20.653 --> 41:22.693
And if it doesn't matter
to me either?

41:22.693 --> 41:24.012
And if it doesn't matter
to me either?

41:24.413 --> 41:26.324
Then what?

41:29.613 --> 41:32.127
I don't live that far from here.

41:38.413 --> 41:42.452
Isn't this one of those things we swear
to ourselves we're going to avoid?

41:42.653 --> 41:44.405
Yeah.

41:45.253 --> 41:47.528
But let's do it anyway.

41:49.773 --> 41:52.003
Let's get the check.

42:22.813 --> 42:24.773
You're not married, are you? Hm?

42:24.773 --> 42:26.411
You're not married, are you? Hm?

42:29.293 --> 42:31.887
You think I'd do that?

42:34.053 --> 42:35.850
No.

42:37.253 --> 42:39.244
Mm-mm.

42:39.413 --> 42:41.085
No.

42:41.453 --> 42:43.125
Okay.

42:44.173 --> 42:47.370
So now that you know
that I'm free and clear...

42:48.373 --> 42:50.807
...does that mean we're...?

42:51.773 --> 42:54.412
Well, you gonna see me again?

42:54.573 --> 42:57.246
You might not be married...

42:58.413 --> 43:02.770
...but something about you
doesn't strike me as free and clear.

43:04.373 --> 43:08.412
I didn't mean that you
have a girlfriend necessarily.

43:10.493 --> 43:12.643
I don't know what I meant.

43:12.853 --> 43:17.483
That wasn't what you
asked me anyway, was it?

43:29.013 --> 43:31.811
Yes, I'd like to see you again.

43:34.133 --> 43:36.249
I like seeing you now.

43:37.053 --> 43:38.771
Good.

43:50.293 --> 43:53.171
First time's always the worst,
you know.
