WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:05.065
* I am one as you are three...

00:05.100 --> 00:06.761
MAN: _
Hey, CarrIe.
So, what up?

00:07.800 --> 00:08.960
Girl, you're looking fly.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.707
If you're going to walk with
me, you can't talk like that.

00:11.740 --> 00:12.775
Fine.

00:12.810 --> 00:15.074
Hey, did you call me
last night?
No.

00:15.110 --> 00:17.749
Okay, uh, 'cause I was out
watching Terminator 2.

00:17.780 --> 00:19.645
I thought maybe...
T2

00:19.680 --> 00:20.817
I've only seen it twice.

00:20.850 --> 00:22.545
Seven times.

00:22.590 --> 00:24.785
We saw it at the Syracuse
Seven two Fridays ago,

00:24.820 --> 00:26.617
when you kept
trying to kiss me,

00:26.660 --> 00:28.548
and you saw it by yourself
at the Regency in...

00:28.590 --> 00:30.319
Stop, okay?
You're my most annoying friend.

00:30.360 --> 00:31.679
I'm your only friend.

00:33.130 --> 00:34.392
Loolq, loolq, loolq.

00:34.430 --> 00:37.069
Oh.
GIRL:
Hey, Joey.

00:37.100 --> 00:38.727
You're looking
so hot today.

00:38.770 --> 00:40.192
Yo, and Mr. Potato Head called.

00:40.240 --> 00:41.389
He wants

00:41.440 --> 00:42.566
his complexion back.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.100
Aren't you late
for class, guys?

00:44.140 --> 00:46.108
Oh, hey, it's Scary Carrie.

00:46.140 --> 00:47.437
Yeah, we're not too worried.

00:47.480 --> 00:48.799
You should be, Danielle.

00:48.840 --> 00:51.149
You have six tardies
in physics, four of them

00:51.180 --> 00:53.148
absences, and Jason,
if you're gonna

00:53.180 --> 00:56.115
cut English again like you did
period three last Tuesday,

00:56.150 --> 00:58.084
you probably shouldn't
go brag about it

00:58.120 --> 01:00.850
in the cafeteria
37 minutes later.

01:00.890 --> 01:03.552
How does it feel to be a freak?

01:03.590 --> 01:04.818
I don't know.

01:04.860 --> 01:06.794
How does it feel to be too dumb

01:06.830 --> 01:08.798
to remember
you asked me that last month?

01:08.830 --> 01:10.593
I got a question.

01:10.630 --> 01:13.098
You guys scared of the dark?

01:13.140 --> 01:14.789
Wait. No.
Hey, man.

01:14.840 --> 01:16.205
Wait. Wait.
Come on, guys, no!

01:16.240 --> 01:18.128
Wait, guys...

01:18.170 --> 01:19.171
CARRIE:
I'm not coming out.

01:19.210 --> 01:22.668
Carrie, it was 20 years ago.
You're gonna be fine.

01:22.710 --> 01:24.109
These are mean people, Al.

01:24.150 --> 01:25.606
They locked me
in a closet with Joey Falks.

01:25.650 --> 01:28.414
You've disarmed terrorists,
faced down assassins.

01:28.450 --> 01:29.849
This is high school,

01:29.890 --> 01:32.154
and_no terrorist
or assassm ever voted me

01:32.190 --> 01:33.612
"most likely
to be single forever."

01:33.660 --> 01:35.514
Really

01:35.560 --> 01:37.118
Yeah.
Look,

01:37.160 --> 01:39.151
I won't let 'em pick on you.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.849
Promis_e?
I promise.

01:40.900 --> 01:43.221
Come on, it'll be an adventure.

01:43.270 --> 01:44.464
Now, let's go.

01:45.900 --> 01:48.130
* Ah, yeah

01:48.170 --> 01:52.379
* I'm glad
you put this tape in... *

01:52.410 --> 01:54.878
I don't feel so...
Just breathe,
and you're gonna be fine.

01:54.910 --> 01:56.468
I know, I am
gonna be fine.

01:56.510 --> 01:59.172
And you're gonna
stay with me...
I'm right here.

01:59.220 --> 02:02.189
Oh, my God.
That's Hank Bronski.

02:02.220 --> 02:03.517
Hank who?

02:03.550 --> 02:05.541
Yeah, Hank Bronski,
prom king, quarterback.

02:05.590 --> 02:07.410
Are you blushing?
Now he's coming over.

02:07.460 --> 02:09.724
Let go. Let go. Uh...

02:09.760 --> 02:11.250
I had to come over
and say hello.

02:11.290 --> 02:12.848
Hello.

02:12.900 --> 02:13.889
Al Burns?

02:13.930 --> 02:16.160
Hank Bronski.

02:16.200 --> 02:19.863
You partnered with my uncle in
the Syracuse PD. Dave Corwin?

02:19.900 --> 02:21.891
Dave Corwin. Son of a bitch.
How's he doing?

02:21.940 --> 02:23.931
Great. He used to
tell the story

02:23.970 --> 02:25.904
about the time
that you climbed...

02:25.940 --> 02:27.373
Hank Bronski.

02:27.410 --> 02:29.275
It's very nice
to meet you, Mrs. Burns.

02:29.310 --> 02:30.379
No, I'm...

02:30.410 --> 02:32.878
You actually went to school
with me. Carrie Wells.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.649
Carrie Wells.

02:34.680 --> 02:36.238
Wait. Scary Carrie?

02:36.290 --> 02:38.212
Scary Carrie?
Oh. No-no one calls
me that anymore.

02:38.250 --> 02:39.387
You were

02:39.420 --> 02:40.614
my number one will-be.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.582
I sure don't like
the sound of that.

02:42.630 --> 02:43.824
It means "will be hot."

02:43.860 --> 02:45.259
Aw.

02:45.290 --> 02:46.951
I guess I was dead-on.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.524
Well, thank you,
Hank.
Ah...

02:48.560 --> 02:49.527
That-that...

02:49.570 --> 02:50.628
So, Carrie mentioned

02:50.670 --> 02:52.592
you played quarterback.
What kind of team you have?

02:52.640 --> 02:55.564
Oh, pretty good. We went
to state finals against Troy.

02:55.600 --> 02:58.728
Yeah, he threw for 387 yards
and three touchdowns.

02:58.770 --> 02:59.771
I'm honored that you...

02:59.810 --> 03:00.777
AL:
Easy there, Namath.

03:00.810 --> 03:03.472
She remembers everything.

03:03.510 --> 03:06.217
Who are the
screamers?
Ah.

03:06.250 --> 03:08.639
Bella Krebs. She's the
one on the left.

03:08.680 --> 03:09.817
She was my girlfriend
sophomore year.

03:09.850 --> 03:10.942
The other is

03:10.990 --> 03:13.254
Melanie Latham.
They were kind of

03:13.290 --> 03:14.848
best friends-rivals.

03:14.890 --> 03:17.256
You've screwed
every guy at this school.

03:17.290 --> 03:19.656
More rivals than friends.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.327
HANK:
Well, Melanie
was also my...

03:21.360 --> 03:24.227
Your girlfriend
sophomore year, yeah.

03:24.270 --> 03:25.259
AL:
Sounds like a good year.

03:25.300 --> 03:26.938
Who didn't you go outwith?

03:26.970 --> 03:27.959
Hey, hey, it's Hank.
Hankster.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.467
Hey.

03:29.510 --> 03:32.001
Nice chatting
with you, Hank.

03:32.040 --> 03:32.802
How'd you let him get away?

03:32.840 --> 03:34.774
Do I detect a
note of Jealousy?

03:34.810 --> 03:35.936
Hardly, but for the record,

03:35.980 --> 03:39.609
I threw four touchdowns and
457 yards in the state finals.

03:39.650 --> 03:40.969
Ah, that's impressive.

03:41.020 --> 03:43.341
AL:
What's up with them?

03:43.390 --> 03:44.948
Oh, you know that band
Locked and Upright?

03:44.990 --> 03:46.719
Gets a little fuzzy
for me after Springsteen.

03:46.760 --> 03:50.287
The lead singer, Lance Burke--
he was in our class.

03:51.930 --> 03:52.897
No, no, no, no, no.
Yes.

03:52.930 --> 03:55.524
Yeah.
He was a stoner, and
he never bathed. No!

03:55.560 --> 03:57.323
Okay, so we got the, uh,

03:57.370 --> 03:59.668
stoners, the jocks,
the queen bees.

03:59.700 --> 04:01.429
Where'd you fit in?

04:01.470 --> 04:03.904
News flash. I didn't.

04:03.940 --> 04:05.737
So, what is that,
a single malt?
Yep.

04:05.770 --> 04:07.328
Let me see the bottle.
You bet.

04:07.380 --> 04:08.802
AL:
Two whiskeys.

04:08.840 --> 04:10.478
Coming up.
Melanie, right?

04:10.510 --> 04:12.341
Scary Carrie.

04:12.380 --> 04:14.371
No one calls me that anymore.

04:14.420 --> 04:15.978
Oh. I'm Melanie Lambert.

04:16.020 --> 04:17.783
I'm sure you weren't
in our class.

04:17.820 --> 04:18.980
No, I went to Central.

04:19.020 --> 04:20.658
Al Burns.
You better be careful, Al.

04:20.690 --> 04:23.386
Melanie likes quarterbacks
a lot.
Walt.

04:23.430 --> 04:26.627
Not t Al Burnosï¬‚ Undefeated

04:26.660 --> 04:28.298
Whose reunion is this?

04:28.330 --> 04:29.490
As a matter of fact...

04:29.530 --> 04:31.395
Well, my brother went
to Central.

04:31.430 --> 04:33.898
He is going to flip when
I tell him I saw you here.

04:33.940 --> 04:36.067
So, Melanie,
wh

04:36.100 --> 04:37.169
What have you
been up to?

04:37.210 --> 04:39.531
Venture capital. The Claman
Group here in the city.

04:39.580 --> 04:40.535
That's impressive.

04:40.580 --> 04:42.377
I do Far East
for them.

04:42.410 --> 04:44.970
Last weekend was Jakarta.
I have to be in Beijing

04:45.010 --> 04:46.341
on Monday.

04:46.380 --> 04:48.416
What about
you guys?
We're cops.

04:48.450 --> 04:50.839
Giving back to the community.

04:50.890 --> 04:51.845
Good for you.

04:51.890 --> 04:53.380
You have a card?

04:53.420 --> 04:56.423
I've been getting a lot
of creepy hang-ups lately.

04:56.460 --> 04:57.552
We don't do that.
We-we work In major...

04:57.590 --> 04:58.921
No problem.

05:00.460 --> 05:01.791
It was great
to see you, Carrie.

05:01.830 --> 05:02.922
Al.

05:04.830 --> 05:05.990
Hmm.

05:06.030 --> 05:08.498
Why didn't you
just get a room?

05:08.540 --> 05:10.508
Do I detect some jealousy?

05:10.540 --> 05:11.734
Carrie!

05:11.770 --> 05:13.328
Joey!

05:13.380 --> 05:15.075
I was hoping
you'd be here.
Yeah.

05:15.110 --> 05:17.840
Joey was my only friend
in school. This is Al.

05:17.880 --> 05:20.440
I heard you were a cop.

05:20.480 --> 05:22.038
Yes.
It was on the
alumni Web site.

05:22.080 --> 05:24.412
Actually, I run the site.

05:24.450 --> 05:27.317
Well, Joey was, um,
president of the A/V club.

05:30.490 --> 05:31.422
You know, Al's my-my partner.

05:31.460 --> 05:33.394
I was just telling him
about you, actually.

05:33.430 --> 05:34.658
Not the closet story?

05:34.700 --> 05:36.122
The closet story?

05:36.160 --> 05:37.127
There he is!

05:38.630 --> 05:39.995
Oh.
Good news.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.098
I'm giving out noogies
at half...

05:41.140 --> 05:42.767
Half price. That's right.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.437
Always original, Tommy.

05:44.470 --> 05:47.473
Scary Carrie!

05:47.510 --> 05:49.137
No one calls me...
Never mind.

05:49.180 --> 05:50.101
TOMMY:
Hey, you know

05:50.150 --> 05:51.469
those kind of people

05:51.510 --> 05:52.716
that show you pictures
of everything

05:52.750 --> 05:54.069
going on in
their lives?

05:54.120 --> 05:56.008
Here we go.
Bad news.
I am that guy.

05:56.050 --> 05:58.780
Check this out.
It's my fishing boat.

05:58.820 --> 06:00.378
Oh.
The Nauti Girl.

06:00.420 --> 06:02.422
You get it?
"Nauti," as in Nautical?

06:02.460 --> 06:03.381
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:03.430 --> 06:05.421
I get that.
Wait, wait.

06:05.460 --> 06:06.620
Here's my family.

06:06.660 --> 06:07.797
Uh, wait.
They're in here somewhere.

06:07.830 --> 06:09.491
AL: That's amazing.
Yeah.

06:09.530 --> 06:11.794
Oh.
I'll be right back.
I've got to feed the meter.

06:11.830 --> 06:13.036
Wait. Don't worry.

06:13.070 --> 06:14.537
I'm just gonna show Joey
my pictures.

06:14.570 --> 06:15.867
CARRIE:
Oh.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.871
Ah.

06:22.910 --> 06:26.414
Did you know the fine
art of bacon wrapping

06:26.450 --> 06:29.886
was first introduced to these
shores in 1654 by the Dutch?

06:29.920 --> 06:33.151
You know, I think we have put in
more than enough face time here.

06:33.190 --> 06:35.488
Let's blow this Popsicle stand.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.659
Really? The night
is still young.

06:37.690 --> 06:40.454
Thank you for coming with me.

06:40.500 --> 06:41.421
Hmm.

06:43.230 --> 06:44.788
Someone help!

06:44.830 --> 06:46.058
Please help!

06:54.240 --> 06:55.730
CARRIE:
Tommy?

07:17.230 --> 07:19.994
Well, cause of death
isn't a mystery.

07:20.040 --> 07:23.828
Crushed parietal bone
and avulsion of the cranium.

07:23.870 --> 07:25.462
Somebody bashed his head in.

07:25.510 --> 07:28.570
Any of your classmates
arrive with a lead pipe?

07:28.610 --> 07:30.669
Maybe my history teacher,
Professor Plum.

07:30.710 --> 07:32.575
Candlestick might also work.

07:32.620 --> 07:35.043
MAN:
Okay, I got
his belongings,

07:35.080 --> 07:38.049
30 bucks still there, keys.

07:38.090 --> 07:39.955
Couple of lotto tickets.
Where's his phone?

07:39.990 --> 07:41.116
He probably left it inside.

07:41.160 --> 07:43.048
No, he was pretty attached
to that phone.

07:43.090 --> 07:45.888
I mean, he kept showing everyone
pictures that were on it.

07:45.930 --> 07:47.158
I want to lock down the hotel.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.088
We need to cover every
inch of this place,

07:49.130 --> 07:50.529
including everyone
at the reunion.

07:50.570 --> 07:52.765
Nobody leaves.
You think they'll mind?

07:52.800 --> 07:54.165
You think I care?

07:54.200 --> 07:56.134
I got this.

07:57.910 --> 07:59.969
Class of '93?

08:02.180 --> 08:03.772
Remember how we used

08:03.810 --> 08:05.539
_ to do detention
In Mr. Seeger's office?

08:05.580 --> 08:07.241
It's gonna be kind of
like that, guys.

08:07.280 --> 08:08.816
Isn't she incredible?

08:08.850 --> 08:10.044
Step back

08:10.090 --> 08:11.682
and take a seat.

08:11.720 --> 08:14.985
JAY:
Wow. Is that Carrie
in high school?

08:15.020 --> 08:16.112
Where'd you get that?

08:16.160 --> 08:18.025
Carrie hooked us
into the reunion Web site.

08:18.060 --> 08:20.255
I got a list of all
the folks who showed up.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.449
Maybe someone pops.

08:21.500 --> 08:24.128
Carrie with the one-strap
Fresh Prince overalls.

08:24.170 --> 08:27.094
Nice.

08:28.070 --> 08:29.935
I have an older sister.

08:29.970 --> 08:31.164
You know, she... the...

08:31.210 --> 08:35.533
Uh-huh. Hey, you get anything
on our victim Tommy Garland?

08:35.580 --> 08:36.945
Nothing in our indexes,

08:36.980 --> 08:38.971
but I'm still waiting
on Syracuse PD.
Okay.

08:39.010 --> 08:40.238
Any luck on his phone?
Nothing yet.

08:40.280 --> 08:42.077
I'm hoping his GPS is enabled,

08:42.120 --> 08:43.246
and that the phone's still on.

08:43.290 --> 08:45.986
Otherwise, we got to hope
he's backed up to the cloud.

08:46.020 --> 08:48.159
_ You can break
Into someone's cloud?

08:48.190 --> 08:50.624
Oh, yeah. Any teenager
with a Null Scan can.

08:50.660 --> 08:52.992
Why? What do you
got on your cloud?

08:53.030 --> 08:54.918
Well, after tonight, not much.

08:54.960 --> 08:55.927
Hey, I'm just wondering,

08:55.960 --> 08:58.121
you ever loop Eliot in
to us helping Carrie?

08:58.170 --> 08:59.637
Oh, I thought you did.

08:59.670 --> 09:01.160
Really?
'Cause I thought you did.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.906
Hmm.

09:05.270 --> 09:06.703
That's cool.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.971
Carrie Wells, Bella Krebs.

09:12.010 --> 09:14.069
How are you, Bella?
Oh, I'd be

09:14.120 --> 09:16.270
a lot better if I knew how long
this was going to take.

09:16.320 --> 09:18.117
We have Phantom tickets

09:18.150 --> 09:20.118
tomorrow night.
Wow.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.355
If everyone cooperates,
you should make the overture.

09:22.390 --> 09:24.255
So, Bella,
did you stay

09:24.290 --> 09:25.985
in touch with Tommy
after high school?

09:26.030 --> 09:27.122
Oh, hardly.

09:27.160 --> 09:29.151
I ran into his ex,
Tina something,

09:29.200 --> 09:31.191
at the new mail in Hampshire
a while back.

09:31.230 --> 09:33.061
She was complaining
he was a deadbeat.

09:33.100 --> 09:35.762
That's it.
A deadbeat how?

09:35.800 --> 09:37.267
Ah, guess
he owed her back alimony,

09:37.310 --> 09:39.107
bounced a couple of checks.

09:39.140 --> 09:40.277
Didn't sound pretty.
AL: Did she mention

09:40.310 --> 09:42.107
anyone else
he may have owed money to?

09:42.140 --> 09:44.745
Sorry. So sad.

09:44.780 --> 09:46.145
Yeah.

09:46.180 --> 09:49.013
This is how we'll remember
our 20th reunion.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.911
No one seems too
upset about this guy.

09:53.960 --> 09:56.155
I think Tommy was mostly friends
with Hank,

09:56.190 --> 09:58.681
and Hank's friends
just kind of tolerated Tommy.

09:58.730 --> 10:00.129
_ _What the hell
IS It again, Tommy?

10:00.160 --> 10:02.867
40 left, 18 right, 22 left.

10:10.070 --> 10:11.867
Is that just
slightly creepy?

10:11.910 --> 10:13.639
HANK:
No, it's not.

10:13.680 --> 10:17.400
Hey, I'm having a party
at my place

10:17.450 --> 10:18.906
Saturday night.

10:18.950 --> 10:20.076
You should come.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.179
Maybe. Thanks.

10:22.220 --> 10:24.211
Dude, are you,
like, insane?

10:24.250 --> 10:26.218
Must be to hang out
with you idiots.

10:29.360 --> 10:32.727
He was a poseur, and...

10:32.760 --> 10:35.251
Bad news. I'm that guy.
Check this out.

10:35.300 --> 10:39.088
It's my fishing boat,
the Nauti Girl.

10:39.130 --> 10:41.234
Those photos Tommy showed us.

10:41.270 --> 10:43.067
I got to make a phone call.

10:43.110 --> 10:44.202
Where-where-where
you gomg?
No...

10:44.240 --> 10:45.332
We got about 50
people to interview.

10:45.370 --> 10:47.179
All right, you-you just take
the next one. I'll be back.

10:47.210 --> 10:49.872
They're not going anywhere.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.911
MURRAY:
We ran everything
we could find

10:54.950 --> 10:56.247
on Tommy, then and now.

10:56.280 --> 10:57.440
You're right.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.185
Sounds like
he was in a lot of trouble.

10:59.220 --> 11:01.780
Money, mostly
after his wife left him.

11:01.820 --> 11:03.048
Foreclosures, tax liens.

11:03.090 --> 11:06.423
You know, he showed us a picture
of a boat that he said was his.

11:06.460 --> 11:08.098
A very big, expensive boat.

11:08.130 --> 11:10.223
_I'm sure the _banks are
enjoying It, but It gets worse.

11:10.270 --> 11:13.262
Last month, Tommy got
into a bar fight in Syracuse.

11:13.300 --> 11:15.165
No arrests, but
we're tracking down witnesses,

11:15.200 --> 11:16.963
see what that was all about.
JAY: _
Hey, CarrIe.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.205
We got some information
coming in off of Tommy's cloud.

11:19.240 --> 11:20.707
Looks like he had his phone
backed up.

11:20.740 --> 11:21.809
Well, what do you got?

11:21.840 --> 11:23.944
You said
Tommy's body was discovered

11:23.980 --> 11:25.106
at 10:47, right?

11:25.150 --> 11:26.447
We got activity on his phone

11:26.480 --> 11:27.913
at 10:54.

11:27.950 --> 11:30.783
GPS puts it in the hotel
after he was dead.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.014
What kind of activity?

11:32.050 --> 11:32.914
Working on it.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.951
But you locked down the room
at 10:50.

11:34.990 --> 11:37.982
That means whoever killed Tommy
is still in the room

11:38.030 --> 11:39.827
right now.
MURRAY:
Okay.

11:39.860 --> 11:42.420
That fight Tommy got into was
with a guy named Hank Bronski.

11:42.460 --> 11:45.293
Hank... Bronski?

11:45.330 --> 11:47.139
I still can't believe this.

11:47.170 --> 11:49.297
I mean, he was just here.

11:49.340 --> 11:51.205
You and Tommy have
any problems lately, Hank?

11:51.240 --> 11:53.071
Problems

11:53.110 --> 11:54.737
The kind you might fight about
in a bar

11:54.780 --> 11:56.236
two months ago in Syracuse?

11:56.280 --> 11:58.271
At the Queen's Bridge.

11:58.310 --> 12:00.346
I was with clients,
and suddenly,

12:00.380 --> 12:03.315
Tommy came up to the table,
totally wasted,

12:03.350 --> 12:06.786
and started bringing up
school stuff.

12:06.820 --> 12:07.957
What kind of school stuff?

12:07.990 --> 12:09.184
Usual. How did I get
all the girls?

12:09.220 --> 12:11.279
Why was my life
so great

12:11.330 --> 12:14.493
Whatever. You're not thinking
I had anything to do with this?

12:14.530 --> 12:15.849
We don't really know what

12:15.900 --> 12:17.026
to think at this
point, Hank.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.493
I mean, it does sounds like
Tommy was jealous of you.

12:19.530 --> 12:20.497
Mm.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.235
How did you get all the girls?

12:22.270 --> 12:24.033
Did he_ mention
anything else?

12:24.070 --> 12:25.469
Was that it?

12:25.510 --> 12:27.899
Actually, he talked
about tonight, the reunion.

12:27.940 --> 12:29.237
I don't know.
It was weird.

12:29.280 --> 12:30.907
He kept talking
about Vicky Lannister,

12:30.950 --> 12:32.508
the girl who died
in tenth grade.

12:32.550 --> 12:34.313
You remember her?
Yeah, yeah, I do.

12:34.350 --> 12:36.511
Whoa.
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:36.550 --> 12:38.086
It's fine.

12:38.120 --> 12:39.485
What was he saying about her?

12:39.520 --> 12:42.182
I don't remember, honestly.
It was all part of a rant.

12:42.220 --> 12:43.949
He said something

12:43.990 --> 12:47.289
would happen tonight that would
turn his life around.

12:47.330 --> 12:48.957
Probably not what he meant.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.219
So, how did all this turn
into punches being thrown?

12:52.270 --> 12:56.388
I, uh, had to get him out of
there, so I guess I pushed him,

12:56.440 --> 12:58.328
and he took a
swmg at me.

12:58.370 --> 12:59.974
He gave me no choice.

13:00.010 --> 13:02.001
Ask the people
at the bar.
Oh, we will.

13:02.040 --> 13:04.179
That's it for now, Hank. Thanks.

13:08.850 --> 13:11.944
All right, they fought
a month ago.

13:11.990 --> 13:13.855
Maybe they get
into a fight tonight.

13:13.890 --> 13:16.154
I mean, Hank is a big guy.

13:16.190 --> 13:17.384
Oh, yeah, he's built.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.455
Yeah, he obviously
works out.

13:19.490 --> 13:21.219
Stop it.

13:21.260 --> 13:22.557
You stop it.

13:22.600 --> 13:24.261
So who's this Viclq Lannister?

13:24.300 --> 13:27.235
Well, she was... an outsider.

13:27.270 --> 13:28.464
Kind of like me.

13:28.500 --> 13:30.400
So, you were friends?

13:30.440 --> 13:31.532
No, not really.

13:33.380 --> 13:35.109
VVhoa!
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:35.140 --> 13:36.437
It's fine.

13:36.480 --> 13:37.879
You're Carrie
Wells, right?

13:37.910 --> 13:39.400
I'm, um...
Vicky Lannister.

13:39.450 --> 13:41.475
I read your poem
in the school paper.

13:41.520 --> 13:42.942
It was...

13:42.990 --> 13:45.049
Super lame.

13:45.090 --> 13:46.443
Watch out!

13:46.490 --> 13:49.118
Dork fest, first floor,
science building.

13:49.160 --> 13:50.354
Get out of here, Didi.

13:50.390 --> 13:53.052
Or what? You're gonna, like,
remember me to death

13:53.100 --> 13:54.954
or something?
Yeah, maybe I will.

13:56.560 --> 13:58.266
GIRL:
Let's go.
Can't you see

13:58.300 --> 14:00.234
these two are in love
with each other?

14:00.270 --> 14:02.465
* Two girls in love

14:02.500 --> 14:03.569
* Two girls in love!

14:07.380 --> 14:09.268
How did she die?

14:09.310 --> 14:10.948
Hit-and-run.

14:10.980 --> 14:15.212
After Hank's tenth grade
graduation party, actually.

14:15.250 --> 14:18.447
She was walking along
a curvy stretch of road and...

14:18.490 --> 14:19.957
She was alone?

14:19.990 --> 14:21.355
Yeah.

14:21.390 --> 14:23.358
We had a vigil for her.

14:23.390 --> 14:25.984
I remember that at school.

14:26.030 --> 14:28.294
Everybody cried.

14:28.330 --> 14:30.469
And then life went on.

14:30.500 --> 14:33.037
You were 16.

14:34.440 --> 14:35.964
Still...

14:36.000 --> 14:37.968
Hmm.

14:38.010 --> 14:40.001
Ah, it's Jay for you.

14:40.040 --> 14:41.507
Thank you. Hey, Jay.

14:41.540 --> 14:44.373
Hey, Carrie, we were able to put
together Tommy's cloud storage.

14:44.410 --> 14:46.048
Contacts, e-mails, photos.

14:46.080 --> 14:47.968
I'm sending them
to your cell phones right now.

14:48.020 --> 14:49.146
And looking over your yearbook.

14:49.180 --> 14:51.319
Congrats on being VP
of the Spanish club.

14:51.350 --> 14:53.318
Uh, "mucho impressivo."

14:53.360 --> 14:55.658
Muy thank you.

14:55.690 --> 14:58.420
Okay, so far, nothing in
Tommy's e-mail or messages.

14:58.460 --> 15:01.395
Lot of back and forth
with his loan officer.

15:01.430 --> 15:03.364
He was definitely cash-strapped.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.129
He has, like,
four trillion photos.

15:08.470 --> 15:09.596
Wait a second.
What?

15:09.640 --> 15:11.301
There's a picture missing.

15:15.410 --> 15:18.140
And look. Here's my family.

15:18.180 --> 15:19.499
Ah...

15:19.550 --> 15:21.313
Wait. They're
in here somewhere.

15:21.350 --> 15:23.409
A jacket.

15:23.450 --> 15:26.419
Okay, so the guy had a picture
of a jacket.

15:26.450 --> 15:29.010
I've seen the jacket before.

15:43.540 --> 15:46.031
Vicky was wearing the jacket
the night she died.

15:46.070 --> 15:47.435
The same kind of jacket?

15:47.480 --> 15:49.175
The exact jacket.

15:49.210 --> 15:51.474
Tonight, a picture
of that jacket is deleted

15:51.510 --> 15:53.171
from Tommy's phone.

15:53.220 --> 15:55.074
What if there was more
to Viclq's death

15:55.120 --> 15:57.384
than just a hit-and-run,
Tommy knew about it,

15:57.420 --> 15:59.388
and it got him killed?

15:59.420 --> 16:02.514
Told you tonight
would be an adventure.

16:12.770 --> 16:16.228
Okay, so we're looking for any
connection between the murder

16:16.270 --> 16:18.204
of Tommy Garland and the
death of Vicky Lannister.

16:18.240 --> 16:19.605
We got nothing yet.

16:19.640 --> 16:22.074
But I'm talking to a
guy at Syracuse PD.

16:22.110 --> 16:23.202
Now, they didn't start
digitizing

16:23.250 --> 16:25.070
police files until 1995,

16:25.110 --> 16:26.407
so they're putting together
everything they can

16:26.450 --> 16:28.441
on the Lannister case,
scanning it.

16:30.690 --> 16:33.250
Problems with the monitor, Jay?

16:33.290 --> 16:35.281
Eliot, it's the murder
at the St. Dimas.

16:35.320 --> 16:37.550
Carrie knew all those people.
Al, please.

16:37.590 --> 16:39.751
We're called Major Crimes
for a reason.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.655
It's major to you guys,
it's major to me.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.759
That's nice.
Of course,

16:43.800 --> 16:45.597
we host 1,200 reunions a year,

16:45.630 --> 16:48.292
which brings in millions
of dollars worth of revenue.

16:48.340 --> 16:49.762
Okay, a little less nice.

16:49.800 --> 16:50.869
And it's hard enough
to face down your tortured

16:50.910 --> 16:54.038
_adolescence without _
getting your brains bashed In.

16:54.080 --> 16:56.207
Ooh, and bashed they were.

16:56.240 --> 16:58.140
I've confirmed
the murder weapon

16:58.180 --> 17:00.410
to be a standard issue
claw hammer.

17:00.450 --> 17:01.712
Lacerations

17:01.750 --> 17:04.218
to the middle meningeal artery
and perforating

17:04.250 --> 17:06.081
injury to the brain.

17:06.120 --> 17:07.052
Not the most efficient way
to kill somebody.

17:07.090 --> 17:09.183
Do you realize
that more people were killed

17:09.220 --> 17:10.482
with hammers
last year than with rifles?

17:10.530 --> 17:11.554
AL:
Not to mention all those

17:11.590 --> 17:12.727
smashed thumbs.

17:12.760 --> 17:14.193
ELIOT:
So we're thinking blackmail.

17:14.230 --> 17:16.289
Maybe. Guy knows something

17:16.330 --> 17:18.127
about the girl's death,
he comes to the reunion

17:18.170 --> 17:20.229
to squeeze
whoever's responsible.

17:20.270 --> 17:21.237
What?

17:21.270 --> 17:22.635
I'm surprised.

17:22.670 --> 17:24.558
You came up with a theory.

17:24.610 --> 17:25.838
AL:
And not a bad
one, actually.

17:25.870 --> 17:28.202
Explains the hammer.
Weapon of convenience.

17:28.240 --> 17:29.229
WEBSTER:
We also found

17:29.280 --> 17:31.305
steel shavings
under the cranium,

17:31.350 --> 17:34.217
so you find me the hammer,
and we can trace it to the body.

17:34.250 --> 17:35.410
I'll check with the hotel,

17:35.450 --> 17:38.578
see if any employees have
lighter tool kits than usual.

17:39.620 --> 17:41.611
See?

17:47.760 --> 17:49.352
MURRAY:
Here we go.
We're getting

17:49.400 --> 17:52.289
stuff in from Syracuse.

17:52.330 --> 17:55.128
That's the Viclq Lannister
crime scene from 20 years ago.

17:58.170 --> 17:59.262
Wait a second.

18:04.480 --> 18:05.708
Where's the jacket?

18:05.750 --> 18:06.546
She was wearing

18:06.580 --> 18:08.468
that jacket when
she left the party,

18:08.520 --> 18:10.340
I'm sure of it.
MURRAY:
Well, that's all they've got.

18:10.390 --> 18:11.812
There's definitely no jacket.

18:11.850 --> 18:13.488
Well, someone must've taken it
after they hit her.

18:13.520 --> 18:15.181
CARRIE:
And 22 years later,

18:15.220 --> 18:16.414
Tommy Garland shows up
at the reunion

18:16.460 --> 18:18.325
with a picture of it
on his phone.

18:18.360 --> 18:19.224
I think
he was involved

18:19.260 --> 18:21.228
in Vicky's death,
or he knew who was.

18:21.260 --> 18:22.557
JAY:
Hey, guys.

18:22.600 --> 18:24.727
Hotel security footage
just came in.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.567
This is the back staircase,
exits on 515t Street.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.329
Someone who needed
to get away from where

18:28.370 --> 18:29.564
the killing took place
would use these.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.465
Like this guy.

18:31.510 --> 18:34.172
That's one minute
after Tommy's body was found.

18:34.210 --> 18:35.404
Fast-forwa rd
ten minutes later.

18:37.910 --> 18:39.241
He's sneaking back in.

18:44.520 --> 18:46.408
That's Carl Benson,

18:46.450 --> 18:47.587
our tenth grade
English teacher.

18:47.620 --> 18:49.815
He was Mr. Hip.

18:49.860 --> 18:52.328
Always recruiting kids
to be part of his posse,

18:52.360 --> 18:54.123
especially the cool girls.

18:55.900 --> 18:59.119
And maybe the not-so-cool girls.

19:04.840 --> 19:06.432
I saw Vicky's yearbook.

19:06.470 --> 19:11.339
"While I am I and you are you,
so long as the world

19:11.380 --> 19:12.779
"contains us both.

19:12.810 --> 19:16.371
Always yours, C. B."

19:16.420 --> 19:18.183
I'm an English teacher,
and that is a quote

19:18.220 --> 19:19.244
from Robert Browning.

19:19.290 --> 19:22.282
That is a very romantic quote
from Robert Browning.

19:22.320 --> 19:23.719
And I want to know
why you wrote it

19:23.760 --> 19:25.921
in the yearbook
of a 16-year-old girl.

19:25.960 --> 19:27.359
If you are suggesting
that anything happened

19:27.400 --> 19:29.459
between me
and Viclq Lannister...

19:29.500 --> 19:30.819
And that you murdered her
22 years ago?

19:30.870 --> 19:33.191
Yeah, that is exactly
what I'm suggesting.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.366
I don't understand.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.868
What... what does this have
to do with Tommy Garland?

19:36.900 --> 19:38.436
22 years is a long time,

19:38.470 --> 19:40.779
and you probably thought
you'd gotten away with it.

19:40.810 --> 19:42.607
And then Tommy, what,
confronts you?

19:42.640 --> 19:44.244
Tries to blackmail you?

19:44.280 --> 19:47.670
Stop. Look,
as far as Vicky is concerned,

19:47.720 --> 19:49.642
nothing ever happened,
I swear it.

19:49.680 --> 19:53.411
Just like nothing ever happened
with you and Susie Jacobs,

19:53.460 --> 19:57.783
the young girl who got you fired
from the Bancroft Academy.

19:57.830 --> 20:00.492
I've made mistakes.

20:01.730 --> 20:04.460
And yeah,
I had feelings for Vicky,

20:04.500 --> 20:07.799
but I never acted on them.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.239
We mainly just
talked about poetry.

20:09.270 --> 20:10.407
She would
read things

20:10.440 --> 20:12.408
outside of class
that no one else would.

20:12.440 --> 20:14.328
You know, the romantics
and Arthurian legends.

20:14.380 --> 20:16.268
Wow.

20:16.310 --> 20:18.904
You are a regular Lancelot,
Carl.

20:18.950 --> 20:20.713
I swear that's it.

20:20.750 --> 20:23.617
I-I encouraged her
to start the poetry club,

20:23.650 --> 20:25.379
and offered to advise it.

20:25.420 --> 20:27.479
I-I...

20:27.520 --> 20:31.456
The night that Viclq died,
I was devastated.

20:33.430 --> 20:37.321
I was also in Montreal...

20:37.370 --> 20:39.361
with a former student.

20:39.400 --> 20:42.039
Of course you were.
All right.

20:42.070 --> 20:44.402
Why did you try to sneak out
of the hotel tonight?

20:45.870 --> 20:47.599
I was meeting a few
faculty members.

20:47.640 --> 20:50.006
We... smoked some weed.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.770
Oh.
And there was a maitre d'
outside of a restaurant,

20:52.810 --> 20:54.516
and he had to chase us
down the street,

20:54.550 --> 20:56.279
so I'm sure you can find him.

20:56.320 --> 20:57.912
All right, you say
you and Viclq were close?

20:57.950 --> 20:59.417
Yeah.

20:59.450 --> 21:00.348
Well, she must have

21:00.390 --> 21:02.517
confided in you,
told you personal things.

21:02.560 --> 21:04.482
Did she ever mention anything
about her home life?

21:04.530 --> 21:06.486
Anyone who might want
to hurt her?

21:06.530 --> 21:08.828
Any trouble
she was having?

21:08.860 --> 21:11.795
Yeah, it was a long time ago,
but I remember,

21:11.830 --> 21:13.536
she mentioned
a guy was bugging her.

21:13.570 --> 21:15.390
A student was
followmg her around.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.465
Um, I remember because I was

21:17.510 --> 21:18.636
going to report...

21:18.670 --> 21:19.864
Did she... did she ever
mention his name?

21:19.910 --> 21:21.502
No, she never mentioned who.

21:21.540 --> 21:23.747
Uh, she didn't want
to get anybody in trouble.

21:26.110 --> 21:28.317
Ithought
everything was all right.

21:29.350 --> 21:31.841
You thought wrong.

21:35.420 --> 21:37.752
So, where are we
with Carl Benson?

21:37.790 --> 21:40.850
Carl Benson-- it looks like
he has alibis for both murders.

21:40.900 --> 21:43.027
He did mention that there was
some guy bothering Vicky

21:43.060 --> 21:44.493
back in high school.

21:44.530 --> 21:45.827
He didn't know who.

21:45.870 --> 21:47.565
Jay's trying
to find him.
Good.

21:47.600 --> 21:48.794
Al, I remember every minute

21:48.840 --> 21:50.034
of high school
like it happened yesterday.

21:50.070 --> 21:53.699
You know, every loaded word,
every sideways glance, but...

21:53.740 --> 21:55.503
but I don't think
I really understood it.

21:57.010 --> 21:59.069
I bet you understood enough.

21:59.110 --> 22:00.975
I was such an outsider
that I think I spent a lot

22:01.020 --> 22:05.719
of my time imagining what other
people's lives were like.

22:05.750 --> 22:08.617
You were never on the outside

22:08.660 --> 22:09.718
in high school.

22:09.760 --> 22:11.580
I got cut from varsity
in ninth grade. That counts.

22:12.630 --> 22:14.450
Okay, be honest with me.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.593
Sure.
Do you think

22:16.630 --> 22:18.723
if you and I had gone
to high school together,

22:18.770 --> 22:21.591
you would have...
you would have gone out with me?

22:21.640 --> 22:23.665
Yeah.

22:23.710 --> 22:26.008
You're lying. You wouldn't have
even noticed me, would you?

22:26.040 --> 22:27.507
I'd have noticed you.

22:27.540 --> 22:28.472
But I was...

22:28.510 --> 22:30.102
I was a dork,

22:30.140 --> 22:32.973
and-and you were
a football star.

22:33.010 --> 22:36.468
I have a hard time believing
you were a dork.

22:38.520 --> 22:40.988
Well, I am glad
we did not meet in high school.

22:42.190 --> 22:44.522
I think you would have
broken my heart.

22:46.190 --> 22:48.693
Instead, we met as adults,
and you broke mine.

22:55.670 --> 22:58.434
Hey. Okay, so Viclq's
high school life

22:58.470 --> 23:00.165
is proving a little tough
to reassemble.

23:00.210 --> 23:01.939
She didn't leave much
of a footprint.

23:01.980 --> 23:03.607
But I followed up
on that poetry thing.

23:03.650 --> 23:05.641
The school has all
their yearbooks online.

23:05.680 --> 23:08.069
Turns out, she started a
Victorian poetry club,

23:08.120 --> 23:09.439
but it only had
three other members.

23:09.480 --> 23:10.515
That's a shocker.

23:10.550 --> 23:11.744
You get a list of the members?

23:11.790 --> 23:12.848
You know I did.

23:12.890 --> 23:14.881
Meet Eleanor Yellen, 4.5 GPA.

23:14.920 --> 23:17.184
Went on to be
an English major at Vassar.

23:17.220 --> 23:18.756
And we got

23:18.790 --> 23:21.429
Christine Ellis,
cellist in the orchestra.

23:21.460 --> 23:23.621
But then there's...

23:23.670 --> 23:25.194
Greg Zoller.

23:25.230 --> 23:27.061
Definitely not
a poetry club type.

23:27.100 --> 23:29.068
His school record reads
like a rap sheet.

23:29.100 --> 23:31.603
Detentions, suspensions,

23:31.640 --> 23:33.528
mostly for fighting.
Only class he got higher

23:33.580 --> 23:35.536
than a "C" in was auto shop.

23:35.580 --> 23:37.878
Yeah, this could be our guy.
You got a real rap sheet?

23:37.910 --> 23:40.003
Still waiting on it.
Got it.

23:40.050 --> 23:43.144
Figured in for a penny,
in for a pound, am I right?

23:43.180 --> 23:44.442
Behold.

23:44.490 --> 23:45.912
An expedited rap sheet

23:45.950 --> 23:49.579
on Greg Zoller-- a couple
of DUIs, burglary.

23:49.620 --> 23:50.928
Then, last year,
he steps it up.

23:50.960 --> 23:53.451
Convicted for assault
with a deadly weapon.

23:53.500 --> 23:54.751
What kind of deadly weapon?

23:54.800 --> 23:56.722
Working at a Fast N' Lube
outside Albany.

23:56.760 --> 23:58.569
Some guy gets on his nerves.

23:58.600 --> 24:01.034
Zoller goes after him with
the first thing he can find--

24:01.070 --> 24:02.731
a claw hammer.

24:13.880 --> 24:15.848
Hey, Greg. Police.

24:15.880 --> 24:17.689
You got a minute?

24:22.760 --> 24:24.182
Remember me? Carrie Wells.

24:24.230 --> 24:27.085
We were in algebra together
till you flunked out.

24:27.130 --> 24:28.995
Scary Carrie.

24:30.630 --> 24:31.927
No one calls her that anymore.

24:37.810 --> 24:39.061
I'm telling you,
I didn't do anything.

24:39.110 --> 24:41.738
That's right, Greg.
'Cause innocent people,

24:41.780 --> 24:43.236
they always run
when the police show up.

24:43.280 --> 24:44.941
I'm on probation.

24:44.980 --> 24:46.208
I'm not supposed to go anywhere

24:46.250 --> 24:48.946
without telling
my probation officer.

24:48.980 --> 24:50.743
He always says no,
so I just went.

24:50.790 --> 24:52.542
You stay in touch
with Tommy Garland?

24:52.590 --> 24:54.080
Hadn't seen him
since high school.

24:54.120 --> 24:55.553
What about Viclq Lannister?

24:55.590 --> 24:57.012
You remember

24:57.060 --> 24:59.153
Vicky Lannister?

25:01.100 --> 25:03.056
Yeah. I remember Viclq.

25:03.100 --> 25:05.568
You remember Hank's party
the night she died?

25:05.600 --> 25:07.636
I remember there was a party.

25:07.670 --> 25:08.864
I wasn't invited.

25:13.740 --> 25:15.731
BOY:
Hey, Greg.

25:18.080 --> 25:20.878
Here's the problem
with lying to me:

25:20.920 --> 25:22.672
basically, I
remember everything.

25:22.720 --> 25:24.312
I was at the party.
So were you.

25:24.350 --> 25:26.580
Let's start over.

25:26.620 --> 25:28.918
Fine, I was there.

25:28.960 --> 25:30.928
I knew Vicky was going.

25:30.960 --> 25:32.985
Which pissed me off a little.

25:33.030 --> 25:34.054
Why?

25:34.100 --> 25:35.590
We were the outsiders.

25:35.630 --> 25:37.325
That was our thing.

25:37.360 --> 25:39.225
And now the quarterback
invites her to a party,

25:39.270 --> 25:41.033
she's just gonna go?

25:41.070 --> 25:42.162
I mean, come on.

25:42.200 --> 25:44.009
The quarterback?

25:44.040 --> 25:46.167
You were in love with her.

25:46.210 --> 25:48.098
I was 16.

25:48.140 --> 25:49.971
Maybe.

25:50.010 --> 25:51.170
Well, of course I was.

25:51.210 --> 25:55.044
A-Anyway, I crashed
the stupid party.

25:55.080 --> 25:57.583
Did you see her there?

26:02.620 --> 26:04.178
I got there.

26:04.230 --> 26:07.256
I told her we should go,
that it was a joke.

26:07.290 --> 26:10.123
She didn't want to hear that.

26:10.160 --> 26:12.321
She told me to leave.

26:12.370 --> 26:15.931
So I went outside
and I chugged a beer.

26:15.970 --> 26:18.632
And when I came
backin".

26:18.670 --> 26:20.934
I saw her walk into a room.

26:20.980 --> 26:22.675
The lights
were off.

26:24.410 --> 26:27.106
But what I heard...

26:27.150 --> 26:28.617
she was with a guy.

26:28.650 --> 26:30.242
I don't know
who It was.

26:30.280 --> 26:32.089
Wh

26:32.120 --> 26:35.283
Downstairs. You know, one
of those, uh, off-limits rooms.

26:37.090 --> 26:38.648
Cheers, bro.

26:39.830 --> 26:42.958
The office.

26:50.840 --> 26:52.637
BOY: _
Hey, Lance, you planning
on sharing those?

26:52.670 --> 26:54.672
Uh, not a chance.
Really?

26:57.310 --> 26:59.198
Lance Burke.

26:59.250 --> 27:01.241
Hey, Lance.

27:01.280 --> 27:04.317
Hey, Carrie.
So, what can I do for you?

27:04.350 --> 27:06.648
Do you always travel
with an entourage,

27:06.690 --> 27:08.908
Lance? Kind of a
clich, isn't it?

27:08.960 --> 27:11.053
I'm nothing if not predictable.

27:11.090 --> 27:13.183
And all these people say
I shouldn't talk to you.

27:13.230 --> 27:15.255
But what
the hell. Sit.

27:15.300 --> 27:16.824
Can I get you something?
MAN:
Lance,

27:16.860 --> 27:18.066
you don't have to say
anything...

27:18.100 --> 27:20.125
This is high school stuff, dude.
We went to school together.

27:20.170 --> 27:21.899
It doesn't involve you.
In fact,

27:21.940 --> 27:24.067
everyone out. Except you two.

27:24.110 --> 27:25.407
Wow. Thanks, Lance.

27:25.440 --> 27:28.773
That was not predictable,
that's for sure.

27:28.810 --> 27:30.209
So, what do you want to know?

27:30.240 --> 27:33.073
Sophomore year.
Graduation party.

27:35.120 --> 27:36.417
Uh, kind of.

27:36.450 --> 27:39.283
Honestly, I barely remember
sophomore year.

27:39.320 --> 27:42.187
Back then, I was either
doing drugs or playing music,

27:42.220 --> 27:43.926
usually both at the same time.

27:43.960 --> 27:46.758
So, the graduation party.
Do you remember making out

27:46.790 --> 27:49.099
with Vicky Lannister
in the downstairs office?

27:49.130 --> 27:50.358
Whoa.

27:50.400 --> 27:52.220
This is the Viclq Lannister
we're talking about?

27:52.270 --> 27:53.862
The one who got hit by the car?

27:53.900 --> 27:55.128
Yeah.

27:55.170 --> 27:57.195
No way. Absolutely not.

27:57.240 --> 27:58.229
No.
So...

27:58.270 --> 28:00.158
what were you doing
in the office that night?

28:00.210 --> 28:02.178
You're 'joking.

28:02.210 --> 28:03.700
She look like she's joking?

28:08.520 --> 28:11.080
Wait, was it the room with
the wood paneling and stuff?

28:11.120 --> 28:12.280
Yeah.
Okay.

28:12.320 --> 28:15.118
I do remember. It was the
first time I was gonna do blow.

28:15.160 --> 28:17.287
My uncle had scored me some.

28:17.320 --> 28:19.185
I did a recon mission
on the house

28:19.230 --> 28:20.788
on where I could lay out
the rails.

28:20.830 --> 28:22.195
You know, the lines of coke.

28:22.230 --> 28:24.892
Yeah, we're aware.
Found the perfect spot,

28:24.930 --> 28:27.865
totally private. No one's gonna
mess with Daddy's office, right?

28:29.070 --> 28:31.163
So, I had, like,
three lines going

28:31.210 --> 28:34.099
and then I felt this big hand
on my shoulder,

28:34.140 --> 28:36.108
and there's the man himself
screaming,

28:36.140 --> 28:37.505
"Get out of here.
My folks are gonna kill me.

28:37.540 --> 28:39.201
I'm gonna call the cops.
Blah, blah."

28:39.250 --> 28:41.969
So I booked.

28:42.020 --> 28:44.113
"The man himself"?

28:45.550 --> 28:47.347
Yeah. The quarterback.

28:47.390 --> 28:50.052
I saw him at the reunion.
Still a jerk.

28:50.860 --> 28:52.088
See?

28:53.290 --> 28:54.188
All right, yeah, I hooked up

28:54.230 --> 28:56.198
with Vicky that night.
Seems like something

28:56.230 --> 28:58.494
you should've mentioned to
the police 22 years ago, Hank.

28:58.530 --> 29:00.293
Unless you had
a reason not to.

29:00.330 --> 29:03.299
And it sure looks
like you did.

29:03.340 --> 29:06.901
A couple months ago, you had
a fight with Tommy about Vicky.

29:06.940 --> 29:08.373
And now Tommy's dead, too.

29:08.410 --> 29:10.139
_AL:
Getting close
and personal with you's

29:10.180 --> 29:12.205
got a funny way
of making people dead, Hank.

29:12.250 --> 29:14.218
I didn't do anything wrong.

29:14.250 --> 29:17.071
At least, not to Tommy.

29:17.120 --> 29:19.748
Is there something you need
to get off your chest?

29:20.590 --> 29:23.150
That night...

29:23.190 --> 29:26.182
I, uh...
I was with Bella back then,

29:26.230 --> 29:28.323
and she got in this huge fight.
With you?

29:29.330 --> 29:30.866
Melanie, seriously,
give me back

29:30.900 --> 29:32.868
the jacket.
It's mine. I_ can't
even believe

29:32.900 --> 29:33.867
you would have
the nerve to show up

29:33.900 --> 29:35.060
wearing it.
It's not yours.

29:35.100 --> 29:36.328
MELANIE:
He bought it for me.

29:36.370 --> 29:38.201
No.

29:38.240 --> 29:40.003
With Melanie.

29:40.040 --> 29:42.406
Yeah. That's right.

29:42.440 --> 29:45.477
I'd just broken up with her, and
she didn't take it real well.

29:45.510 --> 29:48.013
So I let them have their drama.

29:48.050 --> 29:49.540
I went into my
dad's office.

29:49.580 --> 29:51.480
Maybe Lance was there.

29:51.520 --> 29:54.353
I don't remember.
But that's where you ran
into Viclq.

29:54.390 --> 29:56.358
I guess she followed me in.

29:56.390 --> 29:58.927
Honestly, I didn't even know
who she was,

29:58.960 --> 30:00.928
but she was nice.

30:00.960 --> 30:04.361
Different. Kind of... direct.

30:04.400 --> 30:06.027
Direct, how?

30:06.070 --> 30:08.493
She told me she liked me,

30:08.540 --> 30:10.360
that she'd never been
with a guy.

30:10.400 --> 30:12.265
The way that she
looked at me,

30:12.310 --> 30:15.074
she was...

30:15.110 --> 30:17.328
so genuine, you know?

30:17.380 --> 30:20.099
Yeah, I know.

30:20.150 --> 30:22.368
Things... heated up

30:22.420 --> 30:24.149
pretty quick.

30:24.190 --> 30:26.943
It's not like you think.
I realized, "I can't do this."

30:26.990 --> 30:28.389
So I left.

30:28.420 --> 30:30.888
I told her that
she could hang out,

30:30.930 --> 30:33.626
but she said she was fine. And
when I found out the next day

30:33.660 --> 30:35.423
that she was dead...

30:38.300 --> 30:39.528
I never told anyone

30:39.570 --> 30:41.458
about us.

30:41.500 --> 30:43.434
We got it.

30:46.340 --> 30:48.171
You recognize this?

30:48.210 --> 30:49.472
Yeah, it's...

30:49.510 --> 30:51.444
it's mine.
Where did you get this?

30:51.480 --> 30:52.504
Syracuse PD found it buried

30:52.550 --> 30:54.347
under Tommy Garland's
back porch.

30:54.380 --> 30:56.348
A little worse for wear.

30:58.920 --> 31:00.512
Tell me about the jacket, Hank.

31:00.550 --> 31:03.656
Uh... I bought it with Melanie.

31:03.690 --> 31:05.180
I let her wear it around.

31:05.230 --> 31:07.357
When we broke up,
I took it back.

31:07.390 --> 31:10.097
Bella was into it, too.

31:10.130 --> 31:14.066
Melanie saw her with it
that night, and then It was on.

31:15.540 --> 31:17.394
He bought it for me.
What are you talking about?
Stop being

31:17.440 --> 31:19.431
so dramatic. It's not
that big of a deal.
I'm not...

31:19.470 --> 31:21.108
Neither of you get the jacket!

31:24.680 --> 31:26.409
I was so sick of it.
I grabbed it.

31:26.450 --> 31:28.941
There were a lot of people
at that party that night.

31:28.980 --> 31:31.949
I figured someone took off
with it later.

31:37.690 --> 31:39.419
You figured right.

31:39.460 --> 31:41.553
Vicky did.

31:49.240 --> 31:52.403
The only problem with
your story, Hank, is that you...

31:52.440 --> 31:54.237
you said you didn't know
who Vicky was

31:54.280 --> 31:57.033
before she followed you into
your father's office, right?

31:57.080 --> 32:00.049
But I saw her wearing
this jacket earlier that night

32:00.080 --> 32:01.217
before the fight.

32:01.250 --> 32:03.411
There's no way.

32:21.700 --> 32:24.032
Bella.

32:24.070 --> 32:26.334
You're right.

32:28.440 --> 32:30.374
Remember what I said about
seeing but not understanding?

32:30.410 --> 32:31.399
Yeah.
I was sure

32:31.450 --> 32:33.543
I saw Vicky in the kitchen
wearing this jacket.

32:33.580 --> 32:34.547
But it was Bella.

32:34.580 --> 32:37.174
What if somebody else made
the same mistake?

32:37.220 --> 32:39.040
Then who wanted to kill Bella?

32:39.090 --> 32:41.308
Someone who was
deadly jealous of her...

32:41.360 --> 32:42.281
and that.

32:42.320 --> 32:44.527
Melanie, seriously,
give me back the jacket.

32:44.560 --> 32:47.028
You're just gonna stand there
looking like an idiot?

32:47.060 --> 32:49.494
Melanie Lambert.
MELANIE:
It's great

32:49.530 --> 32:51.498
to see you, Carrie.

32:51.530 --> 32:52.622
Al.

33:01.310 --> 33:02.379
Okay, here's the theory.

33:02.410 --> 33:05.743
By the time Melanie
leaves the party, she's drunk,

33:05.780 --> 33:07.668
half out of her mind
with jealousy.

33:07.710 --> 33:09.712
She's driving home,
and she sees

33:09.750 --> 33:13.117
"Bella" wearing the jacket,
her jacket.

33:13.150 --> 33:16.415
She's alone, side of
the road, and bang.

33:16.460 --> 33:18.257
Only it's not Bella.

33:18.290 --> 33:19.450
It's Vicky.

33:19.490 --> 33:21.651
But I don't think
Melanie was going home.

33:21.700 --> 33:24.123
Hank lived here. Melanie
lived to the north here.

33:24.170 --> 33:26.058
If she's on 273 South,

33:26.100 --> 33:27.727
she's not going home.
Hmm.

33:27.770 --> 33:29.260
You know where
she might be going?

33:29.300 --> 33:31.359
Old town reservoir.

33:31.410 --> 33:34.573
Rumor has it, popular
high school make-out spot.

33:34.610 --> 33:37.738
Rumor has it, popular
cop make-out spot.
Oh,

33:37.780 --> 33:39.645
that's not a rumor.

33:39.680 --> 33:42.717
Okay, so it explains why
she was in the car with Tommy.

33:42.750 --> 33:44.240
She didn't plan
to kill Bella.

33:44.290 --> 33:46.713
She just wanted
to get back at Hank.
So,

33:46.750 --> 33:48.581
she's on her way
to the make-out spot

33:48.620 --> 33:51.282
with Hank's friend Tommy.

33:51.330 --> 33:53.082
It's dark.
They're both drunk.

33:53.130 --> 33:54.324
They probably didn't

33:54.360 --> 33:55.725
realize that Bella wasn't Bella

33:55.760 --> 33:58.467
until they got up close
to Viclq's body.

33:58.500 --> 34:01.333
But at that point, why does
she still take the jacket?

34:01.370 --> 34:03.395
Like a trophy?
Maybe.

34:03.440 --> 34:05.408
Maybe. No, but then...

34:05.440 --> 34:08.238
but then she gives it to Tommy
and tells him to get rid of it,

34:08.280 --> 34:10.840
which he doesn't.
See, I'm thinking Tommy panics,

34:10.880 --> 34:12.609
decides to keep the jacket
close, where it won't

34:12.650 --> 34:14.675
be found. It won't be
traced back to him.

34:14.720 --> 34:17.143
It's only later, when his life
has turned to crap,

34:17.180 --> 34:20.217
that he decides to get
his payout at the reunion.

34:20.250 --> 34:22.218
I'm buying it,
except for two things.

34:22.260 --> 34:25.559
I can't put Tommy and Melanie
together at that reunion,

34:25.590 --> 34:29.094
and I can't put them together
at that party 22 years ago.

34:29.130 --> 34:30.620
MURRAY:
Okay.

34:30.660 --> 34:32.764
So, the police reports
had something

34:32.800 --> 34:36.167
about blue paint transfer from
the car to Vicky's clothing,

34:37.800 --> 34:40.701
Neither Tommy nor Melanie
had a blue car.

34:40.740 --> 34:42.298
But Melanie's Aunt Laura did.

34:42.340 --> 34:44.399
A blue '85 Cutlass.

34:44.450 --> 34:46.668
It seems Aunt La_ura's
on a crUIse. We're trying to get

34:46.710 --> 34:49.508
a hold of her. But the morning
after Viclq died,

34:49.550 --> 34:51.780
an insurance claim was filed
for that Cutlass

34:51.820 --> 34:53.617
for front end damage.

34:57.690 --> 35:00.181
Joey.
Carrie. Sorry,
is this a bad time?

35:00.230 --> 35:03.449
N... Well... What
are you doing here?

35:03.500 --> 35:06.298
I wanted to see if you were
going to the memorial for Tommy.

35:06.330 --> 35:09.834
Oh.
Word is, Lance is doing
an acoustic mini-set.

35:09.870 --> 35:12.532
I'd love to...
We're-we're sort of in the...

35:12.570 --> 35:14.834
thick of it, you know
what I mean? We're right...

35:14.880 --> 35:15.972
I thought you
might say that.
Yeah.

35:16.010 --> 35:19.548
I brought you a little memento
from back in the day.

35:21.880 --> 35:23.313
Wow. _
You were just

35:23.350 --> 35:25.614
looking out the window,
thinking of something.

35:25.650 --> 35:29.689
Huh.

35:32.630 --> 35:36.794
Joey, do you remember Hank's
tenth grade graduation party?

35:36.830 --> 35:37.854
Kind of, I guess.

35:37.900 --> 35:38.867
You were taking photos,
remember?

35:38.900 --> 35:40.367
Yeah, sure.

35:40.400 --> 35:42.197
Do you still have any
of those photos?

35:42.240 --> 35:44.208
I have every photo
I took in high school.

35:44.240 --> 35:45.935
I was in charge of the montage
for the reunion,

35:45.970 --> 35:47.767
but then when Tommy died...
That's... Joey,
Joey, Joey?

35:47.810 --> 35:49.835
Can I get a look
at those photos

35:49.880 --> 35:51.245
Sure. Yeah.

35:51.280 --> 35:52.941
Does this mean I'm helping you?

35:52.980 --> 35:54.572
I...

35:54.620 --> 35:57.373
I'll see you at the memorial!

35:57.420 --> 35:58.648
I'm on it.

35:58.690 --> 36:00.749
I'll save you a seat.

36:00.790 --> 36:02.712
HANK:
Tommy and I met

36:02.760 --> 36:05.581
in eighth grade English class.

36:05.630 --> 36:07.882
It was not his best subject.

36:07.930 --> 36:09.852
I remember he asked me
why there were no Hobbits

36:09.900 --> 36:11.788
in Lord of the Flies.

36:11.830 --> 36:13.593
But, uh...

36:13.630 --> 36:17.634
Tommy became
a great friend to me,

36:17.670 --> 36:20.309
and, uh, like all of you,

36:20.340 --> 36:22.900
I-I really can't believe
he's gone.

36:22.940 --> 36:25.579
But, uh,
we played together

36:25.610 --> 36:27.908
for three years on
the South Prep football team...

36:27.950 --> 36:31.340
You know, I'm glad
you stuck around.

36:33.350 --> 36:34.851
Wow, this...

36:34.890 --> 36:37.779
reminds me of that memorial
we had for Vicky Lannister

36:37.820 --> 36:40.482
in high school. Remember that?

36:40.530 --> 36:41.827
Mmm.

36:41.860 --> 36:44.499
God, that's right.

36:44.530 --> 36:46.521
So sad.

36:48.370 --> 36:50.793
Ifeel ter_rible. _
I've got to run In a mInute.

36:50.840 --> 36:53.229
I have a plane waiting
for me at Teterboro.

36:53.270 --> 36:56.876
Were you in love with Hank
during high school?

36:56.910 --> 36:59.799
What, does Joey have you writing
an article for his Web site?

37:01.050 --> 37:04.838
I just remember that jean jacket
you guys bought together.

37:04.890 --> 37:08.257
It was... it was
so romantIc.

37:08.290 --> 37:10.451
The one with the...
pattern, the patch on the back.

37:10.490 --> 37:11.752
You remember that?

37:11.790 --> 37:13.883
Carrie, unlike you,
I've thankfully forgotten

37:13.930 --> 37:15.750
most of high school.

37:15.800 --> 37:17.859
Not me.

37:17.900 --> 37:21.859
Not by a long shot.

37:21.900 --> 37:24.698
You know,
I-I especially remember

37:24.740 --> 37:27.629
how mad you were
when Bella wore that jacket

37:27.670 --> 37:30.275
at Hank's party sophomore year.

37:30.310 --> 37:32.574
What are you talking about?

37:32.610 --> 37:34.043
I'm talking
about Vicky Lannister.

37:34.080 --> 37:35.911
I'm talking
about Tommy Garland.

37:35.950 --> 37:37.019
I'm talking about the fact

37:37.050 --> 37:38.745
that you tried
to make Hank jealous,

37:38.790 --> 37:42.282
which is why Tommy was in your
Aunt Laura's car that night.

37:42.320 --> 37:44.049
I was never, ever

37:44.090 --> 37:46.786
with Tommy Garland.

37:46.830 --> 37:47.956
Yes, you were.

37:52.470 --> 37:55.530
You just hated Bella
so much.

37:55.570 --> 37:57.959
You saw her walking along
the side of the road alone.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.969
What, y-you tried to scare her,
swerve into her.

38:02.010 --> 38:04.308
Either way...

38:04.350 --> 38:06.648
you killed the wrong girl.

38:09.020 --> 38:10.976
That's a good story.

38:11.020 --> 38:14.319
If only Tommy had got rid
of that jean jacket

38:14.360 --> 38:16.817
like you told him to.
Oh.

38:16.860 --> 38:19.420
So now I've killed
Tommy and Vicky.

38:19.460 --> 38:21.951
Anything else you
want to pin on me?

38:22.000 --> 38:24.093
JFK?

38:24.130 --> 38:25.825
Kurt Cobain?

38:25.870 --> 38:28.338
Oh, no. We-we know
you didn't kill Tommy.

38:28.370 --> 38:30.338
But we want
your help

38:30.370 --> 38:32.736
to nail who did.

38:32.770 --> 38:34.909
Your old boyfriend.

38:34.940 --> 38:36.908
HANK:
He loved his
years there.

38:36.940 --> 38:39.875
Hank Bronski.
And he said, uh,

38:39.910 --> 38:42.947
that they were the happiest
of his life.

38:42.980 --> 38:45.813
And I know that's true for...

38:45.850 --> 38:47.886
a lot of us.

38:47.920 --> 38:51.014
So you think Hank and Tommy
were working together

38:51.060 --> 38:53.426
to blackmail me?
We know they were.

38:53.460 --> 38:55.849
Tommy was too chicken
to go it alone,

38:55.900 --> 38:58.960
so he reached out
to his old football buddy.

39:00.570 --> 39:02.868
Hank's real estate business
hasn't recovered from '08.

39:02.900 --> 39:04.959
He's into the banks, IRS.
He's desperate.

39:05.010 --> 39:08.707
And the, uh, Viclq
Lannister thing?

39:08.740 --> 39:10.537
Deal is that... goes away?

39:10.580 --> 39:12.468
Yeah, that goes away.

39:12.510 --> 39:13.670
It was 22 years ago.

39:13.710 --> 39:18.113
We want to catch
Tommy Garland's killer now.

39:18.150 --> 39:20.380
So how does this work?

39:20.420 --> 39:21.853
_Meet Hank
In hIs room,

39:21.890 --> 39:24.586
offer to pay the blackmail,

39:24.630 --> 39:26.780
get him to show you the jacket.
That's it.

39:26.830 --> 39:28.149
And hopefully find
the murder weapon there, too.

39:28.190 --> 39:30.750
Fine.

39:30.800 --> 39:32.961
Let's do it.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.991
Hank.

39:38.970 --> 39:41.803
We have some business
to conclude.

39:41.840 --> 39:43.979
VVhen?

39:44.010 --> 39:46.046
Give me your room key.

40:12.970 --> 40:13.902
Hi.

40:13.940 --> 40:16.204
AL:
We were wondering
where that was.

40:16.240 --> 40:18.470
You're under arrest for
the murders of Tommy Garland

40:18.510 --> 40:19.772
and Viclq Lannister.

40:19.810 --> 40:22.870
What about my immunity?
It's funny.

40:22.920 --> 40:24.888
I don't remember any immunity.

40:30.060 --> 40:34.019
Your pal Hank
really came through.

40:41.100 --> 40:42.965
Here's a song for Tommy.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.638
And for all of us.

40:46.570 --> 40:49.539
* I loved you,
my sweet and lonely *

40:49.580 --> 40:52.743
* Stranger of a friend

40:52.780 --> 40:55.146
* I held you but couldn't

40:55.180 --> 40:59.082
* Share your soul

40:59.120 --> 41:01.179
* And if the time

41:01.220 --> 41:03.609
* Should come again for

41:03.660 --> 41:05.719
* Kissing in the hall

41:05.760 --> 41:10.652
* Meet me like we never left
at all *

41:12.130 --> 41:15.133
* So good-bye

41:15.170 --> 41:19.129
* Sweet and lonely,
things are not the same *

41:19.170 --> 41:22.173
* I have loved you

41:22.210 --> 41:24.804
* But affection's bound
to change *

41:24.850 --> 41:28.968
* Don't cry, sweet and lonely

41:29.020 --> 41:32.148
* Things are not the same

41:32.190 --> 41:36.217
* I have loved you
but affection's *

41:36.260 --> 41:39.024
* Bound to change

41:40.260 --> 41:42.251
Thank you.

41:43.560 --> 41:45.869
* Boats sail

41:45.900 --> 41:50.792
* Slowly by the dock
and out to sea *

41:50.840 --> 41:55.004
* Never stop to think
of what's untrue *

41:57.140 --> 42:00.143
* You and I play little games

42:00.180 --> 42:03.718
* That never seem to end

42:03.750 --> 42:08.141
* Never seem to know
what we've been through *

42:08.190 --> 42:10.181
* Good-bye, sweet and lonely,
things are not the same... *
