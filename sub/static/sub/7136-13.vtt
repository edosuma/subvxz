WEBVTT

01:46.700 --> 01:48.100
- A blizzard is coming,
y'all.

01:48.166 --> 01:50.500
Heaps and heaps of snow
will fall from the sky

01:50.567 --> 01:52.033
and bury everything:

01:52.100 --> 01:54.166
sidewalks, cars, houses.

01:54.233 --> 01:56.700
The ground will grow frozen
and slippery.

01:56.767 --> 01:58.033
Dangerous.

01:58.100 --> 01:59.667
But here in Oz,

01:59.734 --> 02:01.834
we're oblivious
to the weather outside.

02:01.900 --> 02:04.133
Here in Oz,
we're all toasty,

02:04.200 --> 02:06.500
cozy, and warm.

02:25.400 --> 02:26.967
- Fuck.

02:28.967 --> 02:30.567
Cyril, hey, you okay?

02:30.633 --> 02:32.700
- My hair is changing back.

02:34.834 --> 02:36.567
- Oh, shit.

02:37.500 --> 02:38.767
Look at that.

02:40.100 --> 02:41.667
- And my skin.

02:41.734 --> 02:44.400
I'm not wrinkled.

02:44.467 --> 02:47.533
- Let's go, let's go.

02:54.834 --> 02:56.667
- Well, none of the other
nine prisoners

02:56.734 --> 02:58.467
show any long-term
or adverse effects

02:58.533 --> 02:59.867
when taking the drug.

02:59.934 --> 03:01.233
Since we've stopped
the testing,

03:01.300 --> 03:02.967
their bodies have been
reversing back to normal.

03:03.033 --> 03:05.166
- Oh, thank God.

03:05.233 --> 03:06.233
- Morning.

03:06.300 --> 03:08.467
- Morning.
- Coffee ready?

03:08.533 --> 03:09.467
- Yeah.

03:09.533 --> 03:10.734
- Great.

03:10.800 --> 03:12.367
Hope we're not
running low.

03:12.433 --> 03:15.700
Weather Channel says
a big storm's a-brewing.

03:15.767 --> 03:19.166
With our luck, we'll get
snowed in with no java.

03:19.233 --> 03:21.567
Any word on how
McManus is doing?

03:21.633 --> 03:23.834
- Yeah, I stopped by
the hospital on my way here.

03:23.900 --> 03:26.000
Uh, he's in great spirits.

03:26.066 --> 03:28.700
Dr. Nasca says he's doing well,
and he should be back next week.

03:28.767 --> 03:29.800
- Good.

03:29.867 --> 03:32.066
- Wow,
great news all around.

03:42.767 --> 03:44.066
- Dr. Nathan.

03:44.133 --> 03:45.500
Jeffrey Seitz.

03:45.567 --> 03:46.900
- What can I do for you,
Mr. Seitz?

03:46.967 --> 03:49.266
- I'm an attorney
at Downing, McNally, Adema.

03:49.333 --> 03:51.367
The Weigert Corporation
has retained my firm

03:51.433 --> 03:52.734
to handle all
the litigation

03:52.800 --> 03:55.467
regarding the so-called
aging pill.

03:55.533 --> 03:56.767
- Litigation?

03:56.834 --> 04:00.100
- The family of the prisoner
who died, Fred Wick,

04:00.166 --> 04:03.200
is suing for $25 million.

04:03.266 --> 04:04.934
You're named as
a co-defendant.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.066
- Wait, I am?

04:06.133 --> 04:07.533
- Relax.

04:07.600 --> 04:09.500
I'm confident that the Wicks
will settle out of court.

04:09.567 --> 04:10.734
The more serious problem

04:10.800 --> 04:12.567
is the State Medical
Board of Ethics,

04:12.633 --> 04:15.233
a decidedly
less-predictable group.

04:15.300 --> 04:16.700
They want to
hold a hearing

04:16.767 --> 04:18.900
to determine if there was
any malpractice on your part

04:18.967 --> 04:20.867
during the drug testing.

04:20.934 --> 04:22.533
- You mean--

04:22.600 --> 04:25.367
- Yes, you could lose
your medical license.

04:42.533 --> 04:45.300
- The Weigert Corporation says
you mishandled the experiment.

04:50.333 --> 04:52.834
- 15 inches of snow
over the next three days,

04:52.900 --> 04:56.100
with a temperature below zero
and winds at 30 miles per hour,

04:56.166 --> 04:57.734
the morning commute
will be havoc...

04:57.800 --> 04:59.133
- O'Reily...

04:59.200 --> 05:00.734
- A travel advisory
has been issued...

05:00.800 --> 05:02.633
- You got a visitor.

05:02.700 --> 05:03.700
- Who?

05:03.767 --> 05:05.567
- I don't know, some broad.

05:24.767 --> 05:26.633
- Who are you?

05:26.700 --> 05:28.967
- My name is
Suzanne Fitzgerald.

05:29.033 --> 05:30.700
- Do we know each other?

05:30.767 --> 05:32.867
- Yes, but we haven't
seen each other

05:32.934 --> 05:34.734
since you were
a very small child.

05:34.800 --> 05:39.500
- Look, lady, I'm not
real big on nostalgia, so...

05:39.567 --> 05:41.000
what do you want?

05:41.066 --> 05:43.367
- Ryan, I came because I have
something to tell you,

05:43.433 --> 05:44.834
and it's something
I think you're gonna find

05:44.900 --> 05:46.767
impossible to understand.

05:46.834 --> 05:48.000
- Try me.

05:50.033 --> 05:51.867
- I'm your mother.

05:54.834 --> 05:56.800
- My mother's dead.

05:56.867 --> 05:59.266
- No.
I'm your real mother.

05:59.333 --> 06:00.767
The woman that you
thought was your--

06:00.834 --> 06:02.734
- My mother's dead!

06:22.700 --> 06:24.233
- Well, finally!

06:24.300 --> 06:25.600
- Jesus, damn it.

06:25.667 --> 06:28.133
- I feel like you've been
in there since Halloween.

06:28.200 --> 06:31.133
- Hey, I got a lot
on my mind.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.567
- Like I give a shit.

06:32.633 --> 06:36.500
- You know, Howell,
you are such a cunt.

06:36.567 --> 06:39.934
- Look at us arguing like
an old married couple.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.767
You know, O'Reily,
that's the problem.

06:43.834 --> 06:45.967
The thrill is gone.

06:46.033 --> 06:47.166
- Meaning what?

06:47.233 --> 06:48.567
What, what, we're--
we're through?

06:48.633 --> 06:52.734
- Yep, time for me to move on
to greener pastures.

06:52.800 --> 06:55.734
- Oh, I'm just heartbroken.

07:06.467 --> 07:07.467
- About time.

07:07.533 --> 07:09.567
I'm starving.

07:09.633 --> 07:11.767
- Alvin, all you do
all day is eat.

07:11.834 --> 07:13.033
- So, what?

07:13.100 --> 07:16.133
I'm supposed to preserve
my girlish figure?

07:16.200 --> 07:18.533
- Hughes, food's here.

07:18.600 --> 07:20.033
- Fuck you.

07:24.333 --> 07:26.400
- Hello there, blondie.

07:29.033 --> 07:31.433
You afraid of me?

07:31.500 --> 07:33.367
You don't need to
be afraid of me.

07:33.433 --> 07:36.133
I'm good friends
with your brother.

07:36.200 --> 07:39.600
I'd like to be
good friends with you, too.

07:43.734 --> 07:45.900
- You can't do that to me!

07:45.967 --> 07:47.333
Get off me!

07:53.000 --> 07:54.867
- Officer Howell says
that your brother,

07:54.934 --> 07:56.633
without provocation,
hit her.

07:56.700 --> 07:57.967
- She's a lying cunt.

07:58.033 --> 07:59.633
- In any event,
I've sedated him.

07:59.700 --> 08:01.066
He'll sleep in
the ward tonight.

08:01.133 --> 08:02.900
- We seem to be coming back
to the same problem.

08:02.967 --> 08:05.233
I'm not sure
what else we can do.

08:05.300 --> 08:06.600
- I don't understand.

08:06.667 --> 08:07.767
- We're thinking Cyril
should be transferred

08:07.834 --> 08:08.967
to the Connelly Institute.

08:09.033 --> 08:10.000
- The insane asylum?

08:10.066 --> 08:11.600
Uh-uh,
no fucking way!

08:11.667 --> 08:14.367
- We won't decide anything
until McManus gets back.

08:14.433 --> 08:16.233
John, take him
out of here!

08:16.300 --> 08:18.200
- Gloria, don't
let them do this.

08:18.266 --> 08:19.467
You know he won't
survive in there.

08:19.533 --> 08:20.934
Gloria, I'm serious!

08:26.333 --> 08:27.467
Hey, Dad.

08:27.533 --> 08:29.266
- It's snowing like
a motherfucker.

08:29.333 --> 08:32.100
They say we're getting maybe
15 inches by Thursday.

08:32.166 --> 08:34.834
- I appreciate you
making the effort.

08:34.900 --> 08:36.500
- What's wrong?

08:36.567 --> 08:38.500
- The hacks are talking
about sending Cyril away

08:38.567 --> 08:40.000
to the state looney farm.

08:40.066 --> 08:41.767
- So?

08:41.834 --> 08:43.133
- So?

08:43.200 --> 08:44.900
So, if he goes to
that shit hole by himself,

08:44.967 --> 08:46.133
then he's gone forever.

08:46.200 --> 08:47.166
- What's the difference?

08:47.233 --> 08:48.633
This shit hole,
that shit hole.

08:48.700 --> 08:50.500
- Yeah, but at least here in Oz,
he's got me.

08:50.567 --> 08:53.467
- And you've been such a force
for good in his life, huh?

08:53.533 --> 08:55.767
- Fuck you.

08:55.834 --> 08:57.633
- That's my boy.

08:57.700 --> 08:59.133
You didn't call me
about Cyril.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.333
You got some
other nonsense going.

09:01.400 --> 09:02.734
Now, out with it,

09:02.800 --> 09:04.533
because I want to get back
before the roads get worse.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.667
- Suzanne Fitzgerald.

09:10.433 --> 09:12.367
She came to see me.

09:12.433 --> 09:13.967
She says
she's my real mother.

09:14.033 --> 09:16.633
- She's a lying cunt,
a miserable lying cunt!

09:16.700 --> 09:17.800
You hear me?

09:17.867 --> 09:19.000
- Fuck, it's true.

09:19.066 --> 09:20.834
- I gotta go.

09:20.900 --> 09:22.600
- It's true, isn't it, Dad?

09:22.667 --> 09:24.266
It's true!

09:27.934 --> 09:29.867
A son's obligation is
to protect his mother,

09:29.934 --> 09:32.934
no matter from who,
even his own father.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.400
The woman who
I thought was my mother,

09:35.467 --> 09:37.433
I knew she never loved me.

09:37.500 --> 09:38.667
Now I see why.

09:38.734 --> 09:40.400
- And Suzanne Fitzgerald?

09:40.467 --> 09:41.700
- I-I think she's my mom.

09:41.767 --> 09:43.266
You know,
only I chased her out,

09:43.333 --> 09:46.367
and I have no idea
how to reach her.

09:46.433 --> 09:48.166
- Well,
maybe I can find her.

09:48.233 --> 09:49.500
- Would you?
Wow.

09:49.567 --> 09:51.000
Would you do that for me?

09:51.066 --> 09:53.834
And this bullshit
about sending Cyril away,

09:53.900 --> 09:55.700
you'll take care of that, too?

09:55.767 --> 09:57.533
- Ryan...

09:57.600 --> 09:58.867
I can't make any promises.

09:58.934 --> 10:01.166
This isn't my decision.

10:01.233 --> 10:03.100
- But you'll plead
my case, right?

10:05.033 --> 10:05.967
- Ryan...

10:06.033 --> 10:07.266
- Please.

10:07.333 --> 10:09.266
Don't let them separate us.

10:09.333 --> 10:10.800
- Ryan?

10:12.266 --> 10:13.867
- Hey, how you doing,
champ?

10:13.934 --> 10:16.066
- Better.
- All right?

10:16.133 --> 10:18.900
I know you'll do
what's right.

10:30.200 --> 10:31.834
- So, how are you
getting along, Clayton?

10:31.900 --> 10:33.166
- I'm fine.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.233
- And the men in
your cell block, who are they?

10:35.300 --> 10:37.467
- They're cops,
one was an undercover narc,

10:37.533 --> 10:40.100
the other's some yokel
from a small town mid-state.

10:40.166 --> 10:41.600
- So,
at least you're safe.

10:41.667 --> 10:43.834
- You've got to stop
worrying about me.

10:43.900 --> 10:45.633
I'm not a little boy
anymore.

10:45.700 --> 10:46.934
- I know that.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.967
- My entire life,
you and Leo treated me

10:49.033 --> 10:51.800
like I was some
fragile piece of china,

10:51.867 --> 10:54.433
afraid I'd break
at the slightest touch,

10:54.500 --> 10:56.767
because Dad was stupid enough
to get himself shanked

10:56.834 --> 10:58.100
when I was seven years old.

10:58.166 --> 11:01.233
- Clayton, don't speak
that way of your father.

11:01.300 --> 11:04.300
- All I'm saying is,
you are too protective of me.

11:04.367 --> 11:05.700
- You'd rather what?

11:05.767 --> 11:08.200
That I'd let you
run with the gangs?

11:08.266 --> 11:09.667
- Yes.

11:09.734 --> 11:10.867
At least then it wouldn't
have taken me this long

11:10.934 --> 11:12.333
to find my balls.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.667
- Oh, and you found them by
shooting at the governor?

11:14.734 --> 11:18.033
- For the first time,
I know who I am...

11:18.100 --> 11:20.266
my true self...

11:20.333 --> 11:22.967
the thing
I was born to do.

11:23.033 --> 11:26.133
I can change the world.

11:26.200 --> 11:30.367
But tucked away in Unit J,
I can't do  anything...

11:32.433 --> 11:33.667
At least not yet.

11:33.734 --> 11:35.967
- What do you mean,
"not yet"?

11:37.734 --> 11:38.834
Clayton...

11:38.900 --> 11:41.133
what are you planning?

11:41.200 --> 11:43.767
- Nothing.

11:45.834 --> 11:47.633
Don't worry.

11:54.700 --> 11:55.867
- Mail!

11:59.467 --> 12:02.500
Hmm, another letter
from your wife, Basil.

12:04.433 --> 12:06.800
She sounds
worse and worse.

12:06.867 --> 12:08.867
I think you ought to
let her come visit.

12:08.934 --> 12:11.433
- Always grateful
for your input, Robson.

12:11.500 --> 12:13.300
- My pleasure.

12:13.367 --> 12:15.900
A couple of magazines
for you.

12:15.967 --> 12:18.633
"Newsweek",
"Field and Stream",

12:18.700 --> 12:19.967
"Swank".

12:20.033 --> 12:23.266
- I like my reading
to be well-rounded.

12:23.333 --> 12:25.867
- Check out the pussy
on page 15.

12:28.233 --> 12:31.467
Ooh, hey, nothing
for you today, tough guy.

12:31.533 --> 12:33.600
- Bite me.

12:33.667 --> 12:34.834
- Where?

12:34.900 --> 12:36.667
- Fucking cocksucker!

12:36.734 --> 12:38.667
- Oh, fuck,
Christ, not again!

12:38.734 --> 12:40.834
Take off, Robson, now!

12:40.900 --> 12:41.900
- Yes, sir.

12:41.967 --> 12:43.367
Bye-bye, baby.

12:43.433 --> 12:45.300
- Fuck you, you fucking
dickless Nazi fag!

12:45.367 --> 12:47.767
- Clayton, Clayton,
if you keep this up,

12:47.834 --> 12:49.800
I'm gonna
have to spank you.

12:49.867 --> 12:51.600
- Careful, he might enjoy it.

12:51.667 --> 12:53.500
- You fucking cocksucker!
- Hey, hey!

12:53.567 --> 12:55.233
- Put Hughes in his cell!

12:55.300 --> 12:57.400
- Fucker!
- Get the fuck in there!

12:59.633 --> 13:01.066
- Uncuff me!

13:01.133 --> 13:04.633
- First, you got to learn
not to run with scissors!

13:09.700 --> 13:12.467
- We've got to do something
about Hughes, Alvin.

13:12.533 --> 13:13.934
We've tried being friendly.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.567
Now we gotta do something else.

13:15.633 --> 13:17.800
- Like what,
boil him in oil?

13:17.867 --> 13:19.433
- We should talk to the warden,

13:19.500 --> 13:21.500
have Hughes transferred
to Solitary.

13:21.567 --> 13:24.467
- Eh, that guy's like
a son to Glynn.

13:24.533 --> 13:27.467
Would you put
your  son in solitary?

13:30.700 --> 13:32.233
- My son.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.433
You got to...

13:43.467 --> 13:44.567
Here, let me show you.

13:48.166 --> 13:49.800
- Thanks.

13:49.867 --> 13:52.066
- John, come on in.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.834
- Office looks great.

13:55.900 --> 13:58.667
- Oh, I hope you're not here to
ask for a new microwave.

13:58.734 --> 14:00.734
- Clayton Hughes.

14:00.800 --> 14:02.533
- Look, I've been meaning to
come down to J

14:02.600 --> 14:03.867
to talk to Clayton.

14:03.934 --> 14:07.400
I've just been
so goddamn busy.

14:09.433 --> 14:10.934
- How's your wife?

14:11.000 --> 14:13.533
- She's...

14:13.600 --> 14:15.633
Okay.
How's yours?

14:18.734 --> 14:20.700
- I haven't seen Abby
since my trial.

14:20.767 --> 14:23.266
- Why not?

14:23.333 --> 14:27.467
- I'm too...mortified.

14:27.533 --> 14:32.133
John, look...

14:32.200 --> 14:35.400
I'm the last one to be
counseling on marriage.

14:35.467 --> 14:38.667
But trust me,
you don't want to push her away.

14:38.734 --> 14:41.333
You push once too often,

14:41.400 --> 14:43.767
and she won't be there
when you need her.

14:56.667 --> 14:58.967
- Abby?

14:59.033 --> 15:01.767
Please come...

15:01.834 --> 15:03.533
and soon.

15:05.600 --> 15:08.967
- ♪ Oh the weather outside
is frightful ♪

15:09.033 --> 15:12.400
♪ But the fire
is so delightful ♪

15:12.467 --> 15:15.767
♪ And since
we've no place to go ♪

15:15.834 --> 15:19.734
♪ Let it snow, let it snow,
let it snow ♪

15:19.800 --> 15:21.233
- ♪ Let it snow ♪

15:21.300 --> 15:22.467
- It's cold in here.

15:22.533 --> 15:23.533
You guys cold?

15:23.600 --> 15:25.367
- Put on
a fucking sweater.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.734
- When is Busmalis
getting married?

15:30.800 --> 15:31.867
- Tomorrow.

15:31.934 --> 15:32.900
- That's what I thought.

15:32.967 --> 15:35.000
Shouldn't we be
doing something?

15:35.066 --> 15:36.967
- Like what?

15:37.033 --> 15:38.834
- I don't know.
Bachelor party.

15:38.900 --> 15:40.800
- A bachelor party
here in Oz?

15:40.867 --> 15:43.767
- Bachelor parties
are one part alcohol,

15:43.834 --> 15:44.834
one part strippers.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.300
We're in short supply
of both.

15:46.367 --> 15:49.433
- Okay, fine, I just thought...

15:49.500 --> 15:52.000
tomorrow's a big day
for Busmalis...

15:52.967 --> 15:54.600
Forget I brought it up.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.233
- He misses Keller.

15:58.300 --> 16:00.066
- I don't.

16:00.133 --> 16:02.200
So, Rebadow,
you're the best man, huh?

16:04.500 --> 16:05.767
This marriage is doomed.

16:05.834 --> 16:07.300
Let's go, Cyril, come on.

16:13.900 --> 16:16.567
- Just think,
by nightfall tomorrow,

16:16.633 --> 16:19.100
I'll be an old,
married man.

16:19.166 --> 16:21.200
You don't think I am,
do you?

16:21.266 --> 16:22.767
- Am what?

16:22.834 --> 16:24.767
- Too old to get married.

16:24.834 --> 16:26.066
- No.

16:28.133 --> 16:30.300
- You don't think
I'm crazy doing this, do you?

16:30.367 --> 16:33.400
- You gotta be a little crazy
to tie the knot,

16:33.467 --> 16:35.166
but it's a good crazy.

16:35.233 --> 16:37.166
- Sure.

16:37.233 --> 16:39.567
Well, like you said
when I first told you...

16:39.633 --> 16:41.133
how's it gonna be,

16:41.200 --> 16:43.867
her outside, me inside?

16:43.934 --> 16:46.834
I mean, we can't even
consummate the vows.

16:46.900 --> 16:50.233
- I've been saving this
as a surprise.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.066
I've arranged
with Sister Pete

16:52.133 --> 16:54.000
for you and Norma
to have use,

16:54.066 --> 16:55.567
on the evening of
your nuptials only,

16:55.633 --> 16:58.033
of one of the old
hospitality suites.

16:59.800 --> 17:01.567
- But conjugal visits
aren't allowed anymore.

17:01.633 --> 17:04.600
- Sister Pete pulled
a string or two.

17:04.667 --> 17:06.700
- Wow.

17:06.767 --> 17:09.767
Norma and I are gonna romp
through Cupid's grove.

17:09.834 --> 17:11.667
There's only one thing.

17:11.734 --> 17:13.233
- What's that?

17:13.300 --> 17:16.834
- You're gonna have to
tell me what to do with Norma...

17:16.900 --> 17:18.734
in bed.

17:20.433 --> 17:22.500
You see, I'm a virgin.

17:25.233 --> 17:26.500
- O'Reily's right.

17:26.567 --> 17:28.166
This marriage is doomed.

17:35.166 --> 17:36.300
- I'm sure
she'll be here any minute.

17:36.367 --> 17:38.967
- Yep, any minute.

17:39.033 --> 17:40.734
Any second.

17:40.800 --> 17:41.934
- She's not that late.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.967
- No.
45 minutes is not late late.

17:45.033 --> 17:46.600
It's fashionably late.

17:46.667 --> 17:48.433
- Plus, I'm sure that
with snow flurries,

17:48.500 --> 17:51.266
the traffic's--
it's just gotta be snarled.

17:51.333 --> 17:53.266
- The snow flurries,
of course.

17:53.333 --> 17:55.300
- She might have even
gotten a flat tire.

17:55.367 --> 17:56.934
- Or a faulty carburetor.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
She told me she's been hearing
a strange ping in her engine.

18:00.066 --> 18:02.166
- Well, see, there you go.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.166
Pete, did you reach her?

18:05.233 --> 18:07.500
- I called Norma's home
and got the voicemail,

18:07.567 --> 18:09.266
so I called the studio
where they make

18:09.333 --> 18:10.467
"Miss Sally's Schoolyard,"

18:10.533 --> 18:12.600
and a very nice man
there said...

18:12.667 --> 18:14.433
that he hadn't
seen her all day.

18:14.500 --> 18:17.500
- My sweetie took off
from work to marry me.

18:17.567 --> 18:19.333
- I'm sure
she'll be here any minute.

18:19.400 --> 18:20.967
- Right.

18:21.033 --> 18:23.734
- But with the snow and--

18:23.800 --> 18:26.000
- Pete, we've been there.

18:26.066 --> 18:27.266
- Ah-ha.

18:30.233 --> 18:31.667
Well, you look very nice.

18:31.734 --> 18:33.800
- Thanks.

18:33.867 --> 18:36.367
This is the happiest day
of my life.

18:41.433 --> 18:44.033
- Are you sure you want
to convert to Catholicism?

18:44.100 --> 18:45.400
- Yes, Father.

18:45.467 --> 18:47.667
- I don't want you
or anyone else

18:47.734 --> 18:50.433
to think that I'm rushing
you into this decision.

18:50.500 --> 18:53.300
- Does it matter
what anyone else thinks?

18:53.367 --> 18:55.200
Father, I know in my heart

18:55.266 --> 18:58.000
that I want to be baptized
a Roman Catholic.

18:58.066 --> 19:00.000
- The Reverend Cloutier--

19:00.066 --> 19:03.600
- I no longer care what the
Reverend Cloutier says or does.

19:04.767 --> 19:05.967
- Okay.

19:07.333 --> 19:10.100
All right, Samuel,
we'll have the ceremony...

19:11.533 --> 19:14.200
Next Saturday.

19:14.266 --> 19:15.734
- Thank you, Father.

19:15.800 --> 19:18.066
- Thank you, Samuel.

19:18.133 --> 19:20.567
- "So, Daniel was
taken up out of the den,

19:20.633 --> 19:23.633
"and no manner of hurt
was found upon him

19:23.700 --> 19:28.400
"because he believed
in his god.

19:28.467 --> 19:30.834
"And the king...

19:33.166 --> 19:36.233
"Commanded that

19:36.300 --> 19:39.300
"they brought those men
which had accused Daniel,

19:39.367 --> 19:42.367
and cast them into
the den of lions."

19:46.533 --> 19:47.467
- Reverend?

19:47.533 --> 19:50.066
- Yes, Father?

19:50.133 --> 19:52.066
- I hope you're not upset
that Samuel Gougeon

19:52.133 --> 19:53.700
has decided to
become a Catholic.

19:53.767 --> 19:56.734
- Well, if by "upset"
you mean angry, no.

19:56.800 --> 20:00.400
But I am fearful
for his soul.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.800
- His soul will be fine.

20:03.867 --> 20:05.166
Believe me.

20:05.233 --> 20:06.367
- Believing.

20:06.433 --> 20:08.900
That's the bottom line,
isn't it?

20:10.567 --> 20:12.233
- You are one cool customer.

20:12.300 --> 20:13.767
I will give you that.

20:13.834 --> 20:15.533
- How would you
have me behave,

20:15.600 --> 20:19.367
red-faced with anger,
gripped by jealousy?

20:19.433 --> 20:21.367
No, that's your game.

20:22.800 --> 20:25.333
My game?

20:25.400 --> 20:28.033
- When Timmy here left
your church to join mine,

20:28.100 --> 20:30.300
you started keeping a tally

20:30.367 --> 20:32.633
whoever saves
the most souls wins?

20:32.700 --> 20:34.033
- That is not true.

20:34.100 --> 20:36.266
- I think that your head
hasn't accepted

20:36.333 --> 20:38.900
what your heart
already knows.

20:38.967 --> 20:42.300
You're baptizing Samuel Gougeon
to get back at me.

20:52.333 --> 20:53.800
- Robson.

20:55.333 --> 20:57.767
I need you to take care of
a little something for me.

20:57.834 --> 20:59.200
- You got cash?

20:59.266 --> 21:00.700
- Uh-huh.

21:00.767 --> 21:02.367
- Start talking.

21:04.433 --> 21:06.500
- The patient's name is
Samuel Gougeon.

21:06.567 --> 21:08.000
- What happened?

21:08.066 --> 21:10.200
- He's been severely beaten,
possible head trauma.

21:10.266 --> 21:12.400
- Frankie, I'm gonna need you
to get me some combines.

21:12.467 --> 21:13.400
- Right away.

21:13.467 --> 21:14.734
- Turn to me.
Let me see.

21:20.266 --> 21:21.867
- How could you?

21:21.934 --> 21:24.166
How could you have
Samuel Gougeon beaten?

21:24.233 --> 21:26.600
- Mukada, I would never
do such a thing.

21:26.667 --> 21:29.700
- What has happened to Samuel,
it's anathema to me.

21:29.767 --> 21:31.867
- Are you saying this attack
is a coincidence?

21:31.934 --> 21:33.700
- I pray that it is.

21:33.767 --> 21:36.700
But if not, and a member of
my congregation is responsible,

21:36.767 --> 21:37.700
he will be punished.

21:37.767 --> 21:39.133
- Yeah, well, do me a favor.

21:39.200 --> 21:41.400
You leave the punishment to me,
you understand?

21:41.467 --> 21:42.800
- Of course.

21:56.533 --> 21:58.600
- Tim, tell me the truth.

21:58.667 --> 22:00.166
Tell me if you are involved.

22:00.233 --> 22:01.667
- Yes, yes, I am.

22:01.734 --> 22:02.667
- Why?

22:02.734 --> 22:04.600
Why would you
have him beaten?

22:04.667 --> 22:07.800
- Matthew 26:24.
"Woe onto that man by whom

22:07.867 --> 22:09.367
"the son of man
has betrayed.

22:09.433 --> 22:11.734
It had been good for that man
if he had not been born."

22:11.800 --> 22:13.467
You told us
those very words.

22:13.533 --> 22:15.500
- But you are misconstruing
their meaning.

22:15.567 --> 22:19.400
- Gougeon had to be punished for
turning his back on the Lord.

22:32.266 --> 22:34.300
- I just wanted to give you
the schedule that I worked out,

22:34.367 --> 22:36.800
clearing the cafeteria
for Ramadan.

22:36.867 --> 22:39.934
- You came just to
give me the schedule?

22:40.000 --> 22:41.533
- Yes.

22:41.600 --> 22:43.300
- And there's nothing else?

22:50.467 --> 22:53.133
- I made an assumption
about the Reverend Cloutier,

22:53.200 --> 22:54.633
that he was a phony.

22:54.700 --> 22:56.033
- But he's not.

22:56.100 --> 22:58.834
- This all started when
Timmy Kirk decided to convert.

22:58.900 --> 23:00.500
I thought that Kirk
should be celebrating Christ

23:00.567 --> 23:03.967
through the...one true church.

23:04.033 --> 23:07.066
But if he finds his bliss
somewhere else,

23:07.133 --> 23:09.400
should I fight to keep
his soul in my corner,

23:09.467 --> 23:12.867
believing as I do,

23:12.934 --> 23:15.300
that the faith that
he's choosing is wrong...

23:17.266 --> 23:21.033
Or should I just be happy
that he's found God's love...

23:21.100 --> 23:22.900
no matter where?

23:22.967 --> 23:26.800
- The Prophet says, "Let there
be no compulsion in religion."

23:28.300 --> 23:30.100
Each soul journeys alone.

23:31.333 --> 23:33.000
So you must lead...

23:34.100 --> 23:35.433
And you must follow.

23:35.500 --> 23:37.500
- That's impossible.

23:39.867 --> 23:42.533
- If serving Allah were easy,
everybody would.

23:45.166 --> 23:47.567
- Reverend,
I've been thinking,

23:47.633 --> 23:50.667
this might be a good time
for an ecumenical service.

23:50.734 --> 23:51.800
- Extraordinary.

23:51.867 --> 23:55.000
I was thinking
exactly the same thing.

23:55.066 --> 23:58.800
Father, I-I accused you of
being consumed with envy.

23:58.867 --> 24:00.433
- I was.

24:00.500 --> 24:03.800
- But I was, too.

24:03.867 --> 24:05.867
- Our sins are our bond.

24:07.934 --> 24:11.433
The house of God
has many rooms.

24:11.500 --> 24:14.100
If a person chooses to move
from one room to another,

24:14.166 --> 24:18.133
we who are left behind
must rest assured

24:18.200 --> 24:22.867
that the room that we're in
is not empty.

24:22.934 --> 24:25.033
God's presence
fills every room.

24:25.100 --> 24:29.333
God's love shines through
the entire house.

24:33.266 --> 24:35.200
Let us pray.

24:38.266 --> 24:41.166
- Currier and Ives.
Norman Rockwell.

24:41.233 --> 24:43.967
They created images
of America in winter,

24:44.033 --> 24:45.834
ice skating on a lake,

24:45.900 --> 24:48.900
sleigh rides along
a country road,

24:48.967 --> 24:53.333
fluffy white crystals
of new fallen snow.

24:53.400 --> 24:55.900
Maybe there was a time
when life was idyllic

24:55.967 --> 24:59.100
and children didn't go to school
and kill other children.

24:59.166 --> 25:03.200
We see the paintings now
and we grow nostalgic,

25:03.266 --> 25:06.300
nostalgic for a place
we've never seen.

25:06.367 --> 25:11.000
We long for a time that we've
never actually been part of.

25:15.900 --> 25:18.567
- I feel like
I've hit rock bottom

25:18.633 --> 25:20.000
and another trap door opens

25:20.066 --> 25:22.000
and I plunge
further into despair.

25:22.066 --> 25:25.367
- God only gives us as much
suffering as we can endure.

25:25.433 --> 25:27.633
- You mean he piles on the shit
to see if we'll break?

25:27.700 --> 25:28.967
Why?

25:29.033 --> 25:31.066
- To test our faith,
and to make us appreciate

25:31.133 --> 25:32.500
the good that we do have.

25:32.567 --> 25:34.333
- Well, forgive me
for saying so, Reverend,

25:34.400 --> 25:36.000
but God is a sick fuck.

25:36.066 --> 25:37.266
- Vern...

25:37.333 --> 25:39.567
- Hank's wife, Carrie,
is about to show up.

25:39.633 --> 25:44.533
She's been to see me regular
since the day Hank disappeared,

25:44.600 --> 25:47.700
since the day she told me
I'm gonna be a grandpa.

25:47.767 --> 25:49.433
Every visit, I tell her,

25:49.500 --> 25:53.333
"Don't worry,
Hank'll be home soon."

25:53.400 --> 25:54.800
Well, now,
I get to tell her

25:54.867 --> 25:56.800
that he's coming
home tomorrow...

25:56.867 --> 25:58.300
in a box.

26:13.900 --> 26:15.367
There she is.

26:15.433 --> 26:16.367
- Hi.

26:16.433 --> 26:18.033
- No, no.
- Oh.

26:18.100 --> 26:19.767
I'm sorry I'm late.

26:19.834 --> 26:23.300
I had to scrape ice off
the windshield all by myself.

26:25.500 --> 26:26.800
- You feeling okay?

26:26.867 --> 26:29.200
I'm feeling fat.

26:29.266 --> 26:30.700
- What does the doctor say?

26:30.767 --> 26:33.700
- Oh, that I might deliver
earlier than my due date.

26:35.467 --> 26:37.700
- Carrie, I got some news...

26:37.767 --> 26:40.100
and it's not good.

26:40.166 --> 26:43.967
But I need you to be strong,
for the sake of the baby.

26:44.033 --> 26:45.533
Okay?

26:45.600 --> 26:47.133
- Okay.

26:48.834 --> 26:51.500
- Hank...

26:51.567 --> 26:52.834
was killed.

26:57.533 --> 26:58.700
- He's...

26:58.767 --> 27:00.433
he's dead?

27:00.500 --> 27:01.967
- Yes.

27:02.033 --> 27:04.033
- Fuck.

27:04.100 --> 27:06.934
Oh, fuck.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.166
Jesus, no!

27:09.233 --> 27:13.734
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

27:13.800 --> 27:15.767
No, no, no, no!

27:15.834 --> 27:18.967
No, no!
Oh, God!

27:19.033 --> 27:20.433
- It's gonna be okay.

27:20.500 --> 27:21.900
- It's not gonna be okay!

27:21.967 --> 27:23.066
How's it gonna be okay?

27:23.133 --> 27:24.767
You tell me, huh?

27:24.834 --> 27:29.200
How am I gonna live with a baby
and no fucking husband?

27:29.266 --> 27:30.567
Oh, God.

27:30.633 --> 27:32.533
Fuck, fuck...

27:32.600 --> 27:33.667
Oh, God!

27:33.734 --> 27:34.867
Ow!

27:34.934 --> 27:35.867
- What's the matter?

27:35.934 --> 27:37.100
- I don't know.

27:37.166 --> 27:38.700
- Get a goddamned doctor
down here fast!

27:38.767 --> 27:39.900
- Central, this is 41.

27:39.967 --> 27:41.166
We need a 68
in the visiting room.

27:41.233 --> 27:43.433
- Oh, fuck, ow, ow!

27:43.500 --> 27:45.700
- Carrie...

27:45.767 --> 27:47.500
- Oh, it fucking--
it hurts!

27:47.567 --> 27:48.834
- Come on, Carrie,
keep breathing.

27:48.900 --> 27:50.266
Remember your breathing,
just pant, keep breathing.

27:50.333 --> 27:51.600
- It's not coming out!

27:51.667 --> 27:53.133
- No, it's coming out,
I can see the head.

27:53.200 --> 27:55.300
On three, I need you
to give a big push, okay?

27:55.367 --> 27:58.567
One, two, three, push!

27:58.633 --> 28:00.700
- Ow, fuck, it hurts!

28:00.767 --> 28:02.700
- Keep pushing, keep pushing.
- Fuck you!

28:02.767 --> 28:05.266
- I can see the head, Carrie,
I can see the head.

28:05.333 --> 28:06.333
- Oh, here it comes,

28:06.400 --> 28:07.934
here it comes,
here it comes.

28:11.867 --> 28:13.600
- Here we go.

28:44.433 --> 28:46.233
- No, no, no!

28:47.667 --> 28:48.600
No!

28:48.667 --> 28:49.934
Please get off of me!

28:50.000 --> 28:52.333
No!
No!

28:59.734 --> 29:04.133
- Prisoner number 0-1-G-3-5-9,

29:04.200 --> 29:06.467
Colonel Edward Galson,

29:06.533 --> 29:09.600
convicted
February 16th, 2001.

29:09.667 --> 29:11.500
Rape, assault.

29:11.567 --> 29:14.133
Sentence: 15 years.

29:14.200 --> 29:16.834
Up for parole in seven.

29:16.900 --> 29:18.400
- This is Tobias Beecher.

29:18.467 --> 29:20.967
He's gonna help you acclimate
yourself to your new life.

29:21.033 --> 29:22.867
Beecher,
this is Edward Galson.

29:22.934 --> 29:23.934
- Hey.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.400
- Which way?

29:25.467 --> 29:26.967
- This way.

29:40.800 --> 29:43.367
- So, I saw a thing
about you on the news.

29:43.433 --> 29:47.266
You raped a fellow officer
at a military convention?

29:47.333 --> 29:49.967
- I've been in the Marine Corps
since I was 16,

29:50.033 --> 29:52.967
and I have lived by
its code of ethics.

29:53.033 --> 29:55.300
One night,
I failed that code,

29:55.367 --> 29:57.500
and I'm being
properly punished.

29:57.567 --> 29:59.066
- Yeah, well,

29:59.133 --> 30:02.166
you may not feel that way
after a couple of days in Oz.

30:02.233 --> 30:04.300
- I'm used to being in
the company of men.

30:04.367 --> 30:07.633
I'm used to
a strict regimen.

30:07.700 --> 30:09.800
I won't have
any trouble adapting.

30:14.834 --> 30:16.066
- Okay, then.

30:21.567 --> 30:26.066
- Do you like to be called
"Ed," "Edward," "Eddie"?

30:27.533 --> 30:29.867
- Actually,
I prefer "Colonel."

30:31.100 --> 30:33.100
- All right...Colonel.

30:33.166 --> 30:35.200
You want to tell us
about your addiction?

30:35.266 --> 30:36.934
- I don't think
it's an addiction, really,

30:37.000 --> 30:38.767
because I don't drink
that often.

30:38.834 --> 30:39.867
- I see.

30:39.934 --> 30:42.633
But when you drink
too much,

30:42.700 --> 30:44.734
what happens?

30:44.800 --> 30:47.000
- This one time
I lost control.

30:47.066 --> 30:48.567
It won't happen again.

30:48.633 --> 30:51.033
- That's easy to say.
It's harder to do.

30:51.100 --> 30:53.133
- For a weak man, yes.

30:54.333 --> 30:56.834
- Okay, yeah, I was weak,

30:56.900 --> 30:58.900
and for more than one time.

30:58.967 --> 31:00.233
I probably still am
a weakling,

31:00.300 --> 31:02.867
but at least
I got the balls to admit it.

31:02.934 --> 31:04.400
- That's enough, Tobias.

31:05.700 --> 31:08.533
Okay, everybody,
see you next week.

31:15.467 --> 31:20.400
- John Carpenter is back,
playing for $100,000.

31:20.467 --> 31:21.533
John, welcome.

31:21.600 --> 31:23.033
- Thank you.

31:23.100 --> 31:24.300
- Well, we've got
somebody here to help you,

31:24.367 --> 31:26.467
whose character,
Miles Silverberg,

31:26.533 --> 31:28.033
in the sitcom "Murphy Brown,"

31:28.100 --> 31:29.467
defined the word
"overachiever"...

31:29.533 --> 31:32.367
- "Murphy Brown,"
funny show.

31:32.433 --> 31:33.900
- Ladies and gentlemen,
Grant Shaud.

31:33.967 --> 31:35.433
Grant, welcome.

31:35.500 --> 31:37.800
- I loved
Candice Bergen's tits, man.

31:37.867 --> 31:39.767
- The other girl was cute.

31:39.834 --> 31:41.367
- Lily Tomlin?

31:41.433 --> 31:43.033
- So the question is...

31:43.100 --> 31:46.967
what country has the most number
of people who speak English?

31:47.033 --> 31:49.333
- America!

31:49.400 --> 31:51.467
- No, England, dummy.

31:51.533 --> 31:55.367
- But for $100,000
it can't be that simple.

31:56.900 --> 31:57.834
Grant?

31:57.900 --> 31:59.266
- My hint is this:

31:59.333 --> 32:03.367
Redbook gave this country
a rave review.

32:03.433 --> 32:05.333
- China.

32:05.400 --> 32:06.867
- I didn't know that.

32:06.934 --> 32:09.800
- I'm a big believer in
fake TV newsmen, Gordon.

32:09.867 --> 32:12.400
So, I'm gonna have to go
with China.

32:12.467 --> 32:14.333
- Well, John,
it may not surprise you

32:14.400 --> 32:16.066
that more Chinese people

32:16.133 --> 32:18.266
than Americans will
understand when I say

32:18.333 --> 32:19.934
you've won $100,000!

32:20.000 --> 32:21.133
- Yeah!
Yeah!

32:21.200 --> 32:23.433
- Fucking Beecher
always gets the answers.

32:23.500 --> 32:25.533
- Maybe you should
go on the show.

32:25.600 --> 32:27.066
- Yeah, right.

32:27.133 --> 32:28.867
"Hey, I'm Tobias Beecher.

32:28.934 --> 32:30.867
I'm in prison
for killing a child."

32:30.934 --> 32:33.533
Okay, let's play
"Up Your Ante."

32:40.266 --> 32:43.333
- Tobias, I'd like you
to meet Katherine McClain.

32:43.400 --> 32:45.400
- Hello.
- Hello.

32:45.467 --> 32:47.567
- She's a lawyer with the
Alliance for Prisoners Rights,

32:47.633 --> 32:49.967
and she'd like to discuss
something with you.

32:50.033 --> 32:51.233
Come in, sit down.

32:59.834 --> 33:03.500
- Mr. Beecher, are you aware
that you're up for parole?

33:03.567 --> 33:06.433
Well, when I was sentenced,

33:06.500 --> 33:09.066
I knew I had to serve
minimally four years.

33:10.567 --> 33:11.934
But all things considered,
I figured my record

33:12.000 --> 33:13.200
would pretty much cancel out

33:13.266 --> 33:14.600
any chance of
getting released early.

33:14.667 --> 33:16.166
- Well, you may be right.

33:16.233 --> 33:19.867
But...I've reviewed
your case,

33:19.934 --> 33:22.667
and I think the extenuating
circumstances--

33:22.734 --> 33:25.000
I mean, the death of
both your wife and son,

33:25.066 --> 33:28.834
your daughter,
her genuine need for you,

33:28.900 --> 33:32.000
your improved behavior
over the past six months,

33:32.066 --> 33:33.934
the commendations
from Sister Peter Marie

33:34.000 --> 33:35.600
and Dr. Nathan...

33:35.667 --> 33:38.800
might motivate the parole board
to look highly on you.

33:41.667 --> 33:43.567
They'll let you go free.

33:45.934 --> 33:47.533
- I...

33:52.567 --> 33:53.934
- Tobias?

33:57.900 --> 33:59.467
- I'm okay.

34:02.233 --> 34:04.033
What do I have to do?

34:04.100 --> 34:05.233
- Give me permission,

34:05.300 --> 34:07.066
and I'll set the wheels
in motion.

34:07.133 --> 34:09.467
And in the meantime,
keep out of trouble.

34:18.066 --> 34:19.500
- I hear you're a faggot.

34:19.567 --> 34:21.834
- Whether I am or not,
what's it to you?

34:23.767 --> 34:27.467
- Lights go out, I don't
want you getting any ideas.

34:27.533 --> 34:28.867
- Trust me, Colonel.

34:28.934 --> 34:30.667
I'm never gonna get that horny.

34:30.734 --> 34:32.967
- As long as
we understand each other.

34:33.033 --> 34:36.166
Fucking faggots are
ruining the military.

34:36.233 --> 34:39.734
"Don't ask, don't tell",
my ass.

34:39.800 --> 34:41.100
- I agree.

34:41.166 --> 34:42.166
You know, I think
the military should stay

34:42.233 --> 34:43.834
the way it's always been,

34:43.900 --> 34:47.333
a bunch of redneck he-men who
murder children and rape women.

34:51.100 --> 34:52.500
- You making a joke of me?

34:52.567 --> 34:55.200
- It seems like you're doing
a pretty good on your own.

34:55.266 --> 34:57.233
- You son of...

34:58.900 --> 34:59.867
- Fuck.
Wait.

34:59.934 --> 35:01.033
Fuck, no.

35:01.100 --> 35:03.066
- Wait, no, no, no.

35:03.133 --> 35:04.533
You don't understand.

35:04.600 --> 35:05.967
Wait, look, I'm sorry.

35:06.033 --> 35:10.000
Will you just fucking
let me explain, you fucks!

35:15.567 --> 35:17.467
God fucking!

35:17.533 --> 35:19.467
Oh, fuck!

35:19.533 --> 35:21.967
God damn it,
motherfucker!

35:22.033 --> 35:24.467
Oh, fuck!

35:29.533 --> 35:31.367
- Fahrenheit and Celsius,

35:31.433 --> 35:34.133
two ways of measuring
the same thing.

35:34.200 --> 35:36.600
Of course, most of the world
is on Celsius,

35:36.667 --> 35:39.800
but we Americans
remain defiantly committed

35:39.867 --> 35:41.800
to Fahrenheit!

35:41.867 --> 35:43.433
We'd like to learn
the other way.

35:43.500 --> 35:45.033
We'd like to change.

35:45.100 --> 35:48.734
But we just can't seem
to accept that zero degrees

35:48.800 --> 35:51.800
is actually warmer
than we think.

35:52.867 --> 35:54.133
Woo-hah!

35:55.266 --> 35:58.500
- So, Jackson, why were
you sent to prison?

36:00.734 --> 36:02.333
- The file's right
in front of you.

36:02.400 --> 36:04.700
- You don't want
to say the words?

36:06.300 --> 36:07.633
- Assault.

36:07.700 --> 36:09.567
- What else?

36:09.633 --> 36:12.066
- This is bullshit.

36:13.500 --> 36:16.066
- It's not easy
to verbalize, is it?

36:17.667 --> 36:18.633
- So?

36:18.700 --> 36:19.934
- So, that's good.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.433
That means you're not proud
of what you did.

36:21.500 --> 36:24.100
- No, it means I didn't do
what the bitch says I did.

36:24.166 --> 36:26.100
I didn't try to rape her.

36:26.166 --> 36:27.367
She came on willingly.

36:29.333 --> 36:32.033
- Okay...I want to schedule you

36:32.100 --> 36:33.633
for another appointment
tomorrow.

36:33.700 --> 36:36.066
- Why?
This shit is not helping me.

36:36.133 --> 36:38.133
- Well, it's helping me.

36:38.200 --> 36:41.567
You see, Jackson,
I have quotas to fill.

36:41.633 --> 36:44.266
And I have to see
a certain amount of prisoners

36:44.333 --> 36:47.600
every day or the state
just won't pay me.

36:51.100 --> 36:53.100
Jackson...

36:53.166 --> 36:54.667
you were tested for drugs

36:54.734 --> 36:57.967
just before the parole hearing,
and you came out clean.

36:58.033 --> 37:00.233
Do I need to
have you tested again?

37:00.300 --> 37:02.533
- Nah.

37:02.600 --> 37:05.100
- I believe you...

37:05.166 --> 37:06.934
for now!

37:19.066 --> 37:21.133
Hey, Redding,
I got a complaint.

37:21.200 --> 37:23.800
The tits Poet sold me yesterday,
they been cut with something.

37:23.867 --> 37:25.900
Shit, I can't even
get my usual high.

37:25.967 --> 37:27.767
- The problem ain't with
the product, nigga.

37:27.834 --> 37:29.100
It's with the consumer.

37:29.166 --> 37:30.700
- Am I talking to you?

37:30.767 --> 37:32.100
Yo, I need some better shit.

37:32.166 --> 37:35.800
- What Poet's trying to tell you
in his own surly style

37:35.867 --> 37:39.033
is that you've been snorting
so much every day,

37:39.100 --> 37:42.800
combined with
the size of your body,

37:42.867 --> 37:45.266
you're gonna develop
yourself a tolerance.

37:45.333 --> 37:47.133
- At least he's tolerant
about something.

37:47.200 --> 37:48.433
- Oh, shut up!

37:48.500 --> 37:49.700
Yo, give me some more.

37:49.767 --> 37:53.200
- More is only gonna kill you.

37:53.266 --> 37:55.567
No...

37:55.633 --> 38:00.166
you need a better way
to, um...

38:00.233 --> 38:02.000
what's that word?

38:02.066 --> 38:05.500
- Ingest.
- Ingest.

38:11.433 --> 38:14.166
Only be careful
where you stick it.

38:15.567 --> 38:18.233
You don't want to be
leaving yourself any marks.

38:18.300 --> 38:20.000
- So, what, in my tongue?

38:20.066 --> 38:22.467
- Or behind your knee.

38:30.467 --> 38:32.333
- Lights out!

39:00.734 --> 39:05.200
- Number 17,
Jackson Vahue!

39:09.066 --> 39:13.433
- As a basketball player,
my legs are what made me.

39:13.500 --> 39:16.400
I know I'm never going
to see another pro game,

39:16.467 --> 39:19.233
so...fuck it, right,
what's it matter?

39:23.333 --> 39:25.100
But it does matter.

39:27.367 --> 39:29.900
These legs took me
out of the projects.

39:31.667 --> 39:33.900
I made something
out of myself.

39:37.467 --> 39:39.166
I don't want
to forget that.

39:41.600 --> 39:43.200
I'm proud of these legs.

39:55.433 --> 39:59.667
- Prisoner number 0-1-D-2-5-1,
Carlton Daniels,

39:59.734 --> 40:01.367
AKA Tug Daniels,

40:01.433 --> 40:04.533
convicted
February 20th, 2001,

40:04.600 --> 40:06.734
attempted murder
in the first degree.

40:06.800 --> 40:08.967
Sentence: 28 years.

40:09.033 --> 40:11.367
Up for parole in 14.

40:13.934 --> 40:19.367
- The time for action
has arrived.

40:19.433 --> 40:21.567
Tug,

40:21.633 --> 40:25.000
you waste Pancamo.

40:25.066 --> 40:27.433
- Done.

40:27.500 --> 40:29.066
- I want Morales.

40:29.133 --> 40:30.834
- Why are so hell-bent
on killing him?

40:30.900 --> 40:32.400
- I made a promise

40:32.467 --> 40:35.734
to avenge the death
of Bian Yixue.

40:35.800 --> 40:40.033
- Augustus, I want you
to get word to Omar White

40:40.100 --> 40:42.333
in the hospital ward

40:42.400 --> 40:46.333
that he's to finish off
Supreme Allah.

41:19.166 --> 41:21.800
- Hey, Burr.

41:21.867 --> 41:23.166
Listen,
I've been thinking about

41:23.233 --> 41:25.767
this little war
we activating.

41:27.500 --> 41:30.333
A lot of good men will die.

41:30.400 --> 41:32.567
- A lot of them going to die
in any case.

41:32.633 --> 41:36.100
- But assuming you win,
what you gonna gain?

41:36.166 --> 41:38.433
The hacks will lock down
this whole prison.

41:38.500 --> 41:40.800
- Can't keep a lid
on it forever.

41:40.867 --> 41:43.000
- Warden finds out
you're the ringleader,

41:43.066 --> 41:44.934
he gonna send you to Solitary.

41:47.600 --> 41:51.600
- Augustus,
what the fuck's your problem?

41:51.667 --> 41:53.700
- You were my father's
best friend, right?

41:53.767 --> 41:55.467
You and him went off
to Vietnam together,

41:55.533 --> 41:57.066
and you came back alone.

41:57.133 --> 41:58.967
And since then,
I have followed you.

41:59.033 --> 42:02.066
I have done your bidding,
never questioning, right?

42:02.133 --> 42:04.133
- So,
now you got questions.

42:04.200 --> 42:07.567
- When I was ten years old,
I wanted a real job.

42:07.633 --> 42:09.500
- You wanted a paper route.

42:09.567 --> 42:11.967
- Right--instead,
you had me selling smack.

42:12.033 --> 42:13.700
- Well, you got to
learn the business.

42:13.767 --> 42:15.066
- Why?

42:15.133 --> 42:17.834
Why did I need to learn
how to sell drugs?

42:17.900 --> 42:21.066
- Because we didn't have
any other options back then.

42:22.700 --> 42:24.100
Let me tell you something.

42:24.166 --> 42:26.000
I ain't going to apologize for
who I am or what I done.

42:26.066 --> 42:28.834
All right?

42:28.900 --> 42:30.934
Do I wish things
had of been better?

42:31.000 --> 42:32.500
Sure.

42:32.567 --> 42:35.233
Do I wish we'd been born in
one of those fancy mansions

42:35.300 --> 42:38.266
up there on
Kellogg Boulevard, sure.

42:38.333 --> 42:42.200
But I don't hope
and I don't dream.

42:42.266 --> 42:44.900
I take a shit in this world,

42:44.967 --> 42:46.333
I see reality,

42:46.400 --> 42:48.233
and I make the best of it.

42:51.100 --> 42:53.800
- You ain't got to
tell me about reality.

42:53.867 --> 42:56.000
I live in Oz.

42:56.066 --> 42:59.100
I live in this chair.

43:01.133 --> 43:03.633
And I wouldn't be here if
you'd let me have the goddamned,

43:03.700 --> 43:06.000
motherfucking paper route.

43:15.800 --> 43:17.967
The man is like a father to me.

43:18.033 --> 43:19.433
- Well, there comes a time
for every son

43:19.500 --> 43:21.233
to leave his father's house.

43:21.300 --> 43:22.834
Make his own way.

43:22.900 --> 43:25.033
- Even so,
I can't betray him.

43:25.100 --> 43:28.200
- Do you believe what
he's instigated is wrong?

43:28.266 --> 43:30.200
- For the most part, yes.

43:30.266 --> 43:32.467
- And do you believe that many
people will suffer as a result?

43:32.533 --> 43:34.200
- Yes.

43:34.266 --> 43:37.100
- You know, I've always
admired you, Augustus,

43:37.166 --> 43:40.500
for being your own man,

43:40.567 --> 43:43.500
for keeping,
especially in this place--

43:43.567 --> 43:45.967
a sense of decency and honor.

43:46.033 --> 43:48.200
- What good has it ever done?

43:49.533 --> 43:52.800
- You get to sleep
through the night.

44:06.066 --> 44:07.600
- I need to talk to you.

44:07.667 --> 44:09.033
- So talk.

44:09.100 --> 44:11.133
- In private.

44:28.533 --> 44:29.934
- Yo, bro.

44:30.033 --> 44:31.033
- What you want?

44:31.100 --> 44:32.100
- Sip of water.

44:32.166 --> 44:33.367
- I ain't no nurse.

44:33.433 --> 44:35.834
- Come on, I'm so thirsty,
man, please.

45:01.400 --> 45:02.533
- Up, baby!

45:06.033 --> 45:08.700
- Mmm, it's so good.

45:08.767 --> 45:11.500
It's so good.

45:11.567 --> 45:13.100
- Up!
Up, baby!

45:13.166 --> 45:14.367
Up, baby!

45:14.433 --> 45:16.533
- Yo, throw the ball.

45:19.266 --> 45:20.200
- Aah!

45:36.433 --> 45:38.033
- Judgment day, motherfucker.

45:44.000 --> 45:47.400
- Do not resist!
- Okay, okay, okay.

45:48.700 --> 45:50.300
- Lockdown!

45:50.367 --> 45:51.667
- What?
- Fuck that!

45:51.734 --> 45:53.433
- Fucking breaking my balls,
Murphy.

45:53.500 --> 45:55.567
- Bullshit!

46:07.433 --> 46:10.266
- When I was a kid, I used
to love reading Jack London.

46:10.333 --> 46:13.367
You know, "Call of the Wild",
"White Fang."

46:13.433 --> 46:14.600
I remember one story

46:14.667 --> 46:16.266
where a man was
in the middle of Alaska,

46:16.333 --> 46:19.033
or somewhere,
isolated and cold.

46:19.100 --> 46:22.033
He lost his dog team,
his legs were broken,

46:22.100 --> 46:24.433
he realized he was gonna
freeze to death.

46:24.500 --> 46:26.834
So, he buried himself
in the snow

46:26.900 --> 46:29.967
and simply went to sleep.

46:30.033 --> 46:31.633
Terrifying,

46:31.700 --> 46:33.734
and yet beautiful.

46:33.800 --> 46:36.800
Acceptance of one's fate,

46:36.867 --> 46:39.867
the way any man should die.

46:42.166 --> 46:44.700
- Giles, get up.

46:49.333 --> 46:50.900
- We're a month away
from the date set

46:50.967 --> 46:53.200
by the court
for your execution.

46:53.266 --> 46:56.633
You'll have to decide
which way you want to go.

46:58.000 --> 47:01.133
- Die old...

47:03.000 --> 47:04.033
Sleep.

47:05.467 --> 47:07.200
- Yeah, well...

47:07.266 --> 47:08.734
that's not an option.

47:10.667 --> 47:12.300
- Peter--Peter Marie.

47:13.266 --> 47:15.033
- I'll ask her to see you.

47:23.800 --> 47:25.734
- Hey,
don't you be crying, man.

47:25.800 --> 47:27.367
Your crying's
gonna bring me down.

47:32.200 --> 47:34.500
- Stop your fucking crying!

47:38.200 --> 47:40.667
- And then there's gas.

47:40.734 --> 47:42.667
They put you
in a little room

47:42.734 --> 47:48.367
and...and drop a pellet
of sodium cyanide...

47:50.767 --> 47:52.967
Your lungs fill up
and that's the end.

47:53.033 --> 47:56.433
- Stoned?

47:56.500 --> 47:58.900
- Gee, I don't know if
that gas makes you high.

47:58.967 --> 48:00.967
- No.

48:01.033 --> 48:02.900
Rocks.

48:02.967 --> 48:05.033
- I don't understand.

48:07.467 --> 48:08.967
- Throw.

48:09.033 --> 48:11.266
- Wait a minute.

48:11.333 --> 48:13.266
You want to
be stoned to death?

48:13.333 --> 48:15.233
- Shirley Jackson.

48:18.867 --> 48:20.667
- Moses, listen to me.

48:20.734 --> 48:23.934
As your lawyer,
I have to tell you,

48:24.000 --> 48:25.333
there's a very good chance

48:25.400 --> 48:27.500
that you're looking at
another death sentence.

48:27.567 --> 48:29.300
- So, we'll appeal
that one, too.

48:29.367 --> 48:30.667
- Yes.

48:30.734 --> 48:32.800
But Congress has placed
a lot of limitations

48:32.867 --> 48:34.266
on death row appeals.

48:34.333 --> 48:35.700
- Which means?

48:35.767 --> 48:38.567
- Which means that you will
probably be executed

48:38.633 --> 48:42.266
for one or both
of these crimes.

48:42.333 --> 48:44.333
You have to prepare
for what might be coming.

48:44.400 --> 48:45.700
- Hmm.

48:47.700 --> 48:51.367
You see, I ain't thought through
that part of the situation.

48:51.433 --> 48:53.633
Because I haven't given up hope.

48:53.700 --> 48:55.934
I'm a man of principles,
you understand?

48:56.000 --> 48:58.166
And I believe down
to the bottom of my soul

48:58.233 --> 49:02.667
that a man with principles
will be exonerated.

49:02.734 --> 49:05.266
- It's always good to hope.

49:05.333 --> 49:09.133
But just in case, you might
want to make some plans.

49:09.200 --> 49:11.333
You know?

49:11.400 --> 49:13.667
Get your house
in order.

49:17.967 --> 49:20.200
- The state attorney general
has refused your request

49:20.266 --> 49:22.834
to be executed by being
stoned to death.

49:22.900 --> 49:24.633
- Law.

49:24.700 --> 49:25.967
Right, mine.

49:26.033 --> 49:28.633
- An anti-death penalty group
has decided

49:28.700 --> 49:30.367
to take up your cause.

49:30.433 --> 49:34.166
They're going to sue the state
on your behalf.

49:34.233 --> 49:37.800
- This mess will probably
drag out for decades.

49:39.700 --> 49:41.433
- Peter--Peter Marie.

49:45.934 --> 49:47.400
- Lights out.

49:54.300 --> 49:55.567
- Giles?

49:55.633 --> 49:58.033
Psst!
Giles?

49:58.100 --> 49:59.967
This whole time I thought
you were a damned idiot

50:00.033 --> 50:01.800
talking in flash cards,

50:01.867 --> 50:04.266
but now I see
you're a fucking genius.

50:04.333 --> 50:06.900
- No, genius, no.

50:06.967 --> 50:09.433
- Yes, genius, yes.

50:09.500 --> 50:10.800
You were supposed to die
in two weeks.

50:10.867 --> 50:12.367
All your appeals dried up.

50:12.433 --> 50:14.533
But by asking
to be stoned to death,

50:14.600 --> 50:16.467
you threw a wrench
in the works.

50:16.533 --> 50:18.567
Everybody's suing everybody.

50:18.633 --> 50:20.066
And like the warden says,

50:20.133 --> 50:22.200
this could take years
to sort out.

50:22.266 --> 50:26.033
- Die old.

50:26.100 --> 50:27.367
Sleep.

50:27.433 --> 50:29.867
- Oh, Giles,
you are an inspiration

50:29.934 --> 50:31.533
to us all, brother.

50:40.333 --> 50:44.300
- I'm curious as to why
you asked the warden to see me.

50:44.367 --> 50:46.367
- I just finished
reading your book.

50:46.433 --> 50:47.834
It's awesome.

50:47.900 --> 50:49.133
- Thank you.

50:49.200 --> 50:51.066
- The section on
Jefferson Keane,

50:51.133 --> 50:55.166
being on death row and
giving his kidney to his sister,

50:55.233 --> 50:57.800
it really got to me.

50:57.867 --> 51:00.467
- I still hear from Grace.

51:00.533 --> 51:03.233
She's very happy,
very healthy.

51:03.300 --> 51:06.934
- Well, I want to do
the same thing,

51:07.000 --> 51:08.567
give my organs away,

51:08.633 --> 51:10.166
let others make use
of my insides

51:10.233 --> 51:12.166
when I'm done with them.

51:12.233 --> 51:14.834
The only thing is...

51:16.200 --> 51:18.734
I want to meet the people
I'm gonna help.

51:18.800 --> 51:21.767
- I'm not sure
that's allowed.

51:21.834 --> 51:24.533
- You can make it happen,
Said.

51:24.600 --> 51:26.867
I know you can.

51:26.934 --> 51:28.500
Power through faith.

51:28.567 --> 51:30.700
- I'll see what I can do.

51:46.233 --> 51:49.000
- Little brother,
I stood where you are now.

51:49.066 --> 51:52.266
And, yo, I know
the need to be a man.

51:52.333 --> 51:55.400
But being a man ain't
fueled by drugs or fists

51:55.467 --> 51:57.300
or banging your bitch.

51:57.367 --> 52:00.133
Being a man starts here.

52:02.266 --> 52:04.200
- Brother Salah's making
another convert.

52:04.266 --> 52:05.600
- Yes.

52:05.667 --> 52:07.900
He has a way of talking
to people on their level.

52:07.967 --> 52:09.533
- You did a great job
guiding him.

52:19.166 --> 52:21.533
- Le-roy.

52:21.600 --> 52:23.900
- What you want, Robson?

52:23.967 --> 52:27.967
- I'm a patient man,
a tolerant man.

52:28.033 --> 52:29.600
But my friend Jaz here is not.

52:29.667 --> 52:30.934
- He's right.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.500
- We had a deal.
Half the cash in advance

52:33.567 --> 52:35.400
for you to whack Kareem Said.

52:35.467 --> 52:38.100
But Said's still walking.

52:38.166 --> 52:41.500
You said you had a long-term
plan to get close to him.

52:41.567 --> 52:45.100
Well, Jaz is feeling
the clock has run out.

52:45.166 --> 52:47.166
- Tick-tock, Leroy.

52:47.233 --> 52:50.066
- First, my name ain't
Leroy Tidd no more.

52:50.133 --> 52:51.667
My name's Salah Udeen.

52:51.734 --> 52:53.100
- Second,

52:53.166 --> 52:55.600
I know I said
I promised to kill Said,

52:55.667 --> 52:57.166
but I've changed my mind.

52:57.233 --> 53:00.333
- First, in order
to change your mind,

53:00.400 --> 53:02.300
you gotta have a mind.

53:02.367 --> 53:04.934
And Le-roy...

53:05.000 --> 53:07.300
you got shit for brains.

53:07.367 --> 53:10.266
Second, you don't back out
on the brotherhood.

53:10.333 --> 53:11.667
- As-salaam alaikum.

53:11.734 --> 53:13.667
- Don't give me that
fucking hocus-pocus bullshit.

53:13.734 --> 53:16.934
- Robson, you looking for
jerk-off time in the Hole?

53:17.000 --> 53:18.433
- Uh, no.

53:18.500 --> 53:21.700
- Then goose-step your butt
outta here.

53:21.767 --> 53:23.500
- This shit ain't over.

53:33.600 --> 53:35.333
- Salah...

53:35.400 --> 53:37.834
you seem troubled.

53:37.900 --> 53:39.734
- My soul is heavy, minister.

53:39.800 --> 53:41.300
- So talk to me.

53:41.367 --> 53:42.934
- I'm afraid.

53:43.000 --> 53:44.700
Afraid to speak the truth.

53:44.767 --> 53:47.100
- Never be afraid of
the truth, my brother.

53:47.166 --> 53:49.834
- I lied to you.

53:49.900 --> 53:51.233
You see,
when I first approached you

53:51.300 --> 53:53.300
saying I wanted to
become a Muslim,

53:53.367 --> 53:57.000
I had vengeance in my heart...
'cause of what you did

53:57.066 --> 53:59.100
killing Adebisi.

53:59.166 --> 54:01.934
But then the bliss of Allah
replaced the vengeance,

54:02.000 --> 54:03.934
and now I'm a true believer.

54:04.000 --> 54:07.567
- I knew the day that
I embraced you,

54:07.633 --> 54:09.467
that you were lying.

54:09.533 --> 54:10.467
- You did?

54:10.533 --> 54:11.533
- Mm-hmm.

54:11.600 --> 54:13.867
- Then why?

54:13.934 --> 54:17.233
- The ways of the Almighty
are wondrous, indeed.

54:17.300 --> 54:20.800
He brought us together
at this time and this place

54:20.867 --> 54:23.433
so that we could
learn from each other.

54:23.500 --> 54:25.233
- You learn from me?

54:25.300 --> 54:26.734
How?

54:26.800 --> 54:30.200
- That day I went to Adebisi
and I swore my loyalty to him...

54:32.233 --> 54:36.400
Since his death, I've been
struggling with my demons.

54:36.467 --> 54:38.834
Still do.

54:38.900 --> 54:43.867
But you've taught me the world
has many possibilities.

54:44.967 --> 54:47.133
- Robson and Hoyt
want you dead.

54:47.200 --> 54:48.934
- I know.

54:49.000 --> 54:50.667
- What are we gonna do?

54:50.734 --> 54:52.934
- As with everything else...

54:54.500 --> 54:56.734
We'll leave this
in the hands of God.

55:04.367 --> 55:05.934
- If you take care of this,

55:06.000 --> 55:07.533
I'll bring you into
the brotherhood.

55:07.600 --> 55:08.834
- Fuck you, nigga!

55:08.900 --> 55:11.967
- If you don't...
I'll feed you to them.

55:16.133 --> 55:18.567
- I'm ready to do
whatever you need.

55:51.967 --> 55:54.333
- No!
No!

56:14.533 --> 56:15.700
- Imam.

56:19.500 --> 56:20.934
Salah is dead.

56:22.767 --> 56:24.533
- I killed him, you know.

56:27.100 --> 56:29.667
I killed him just like
I killed Adebisi.

56:33.300 --> 56:36.266
I might as well have had
the knife in my hand...

56:39.667 --> 56:41.533
In these bloody hands.

56:41.600 --> 56:42.867
- Kareem...

56:42.934 --> 56:45.000
- No.

56:45.066 --> 56:47.066
Say nothing.

56:47.133 --> 56:48.500
- But you can't
blame yourself.

56:48.567 --> 56:50.867
- Leave me,

56:50.934 --> 56:54.166
because my demons
need feeding.

56:56.333 --> 56:58.200
Leave me!

57:16.300 --> 57:18.900
- They say that every
snowflake is different,

57:18.967 --> 57:20.900
but how can they
really be sure?

57:20.967 --> 57:23.300
I mean, think about all
the snowflakes that have fallen

57:23.367 --> 57:26.300
all over the world
throughout Earth's history.

57:26.367 --> 57:28.400
Law of averages dictates
that at least two of them

57:28.467 --> 57:29.934
had to be similar.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.233
Like human beings,
like the men in Oz,

57:32.300 --> 57:34.734
even if
they start out unique,

57:34.800 --> 57:36.767
they end up the same.
