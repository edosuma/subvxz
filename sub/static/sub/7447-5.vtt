WEBVTT

00:01.080 --> 00:02.411
My name's Lillian.

00:02.560 --> 00:04.403
Selling yourself
is a dangerous game, Nellie.

00:04.560 --> 00:06.289
You belong to the Little Gunman
now, do ya?

00:06.440 --> 00:07.930
He looks after me, yes.

00:10.600 --> 00:13.126
What can I do for Phil The Jew?

00:13.280 --> 00:16.329
There's a new boy in town -
Norman Bruhn.

00:16.480 --> 00:19.051
So you want us to destroy him
to protect you?

00:19.200 --> 00:21.168
I'm not as brave as you girls.

00:22.320 --> 00:25.005
Help! I'm shot.

00:25.160 --> 00:26.571
Everyone's talking about
you and Tilly.

00:26.720 --> 00:30.088
Tilly and me rip out each other's guts,
you can just walk in and take over.

00:30.240 --> 00:33.210
Well... I have thought about it.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:25.360 --> 01:28.728
We'll be back, I promise you.

01:48.960 --> 01:50.803
With Norman Bruhn dead,

01:50.960 --> 01:55.124
there were three people left ruling
Sydney's criminal underworld -

01:55.280 --> 01:56.770
Tilly Devine...

02:02.120 --> 02:04.771
Kate Leigh...

02:07.400 --> 02:13.123
and Phil Jeffs,
mostly known as Phil The Jew.

02:13.280 --> 02:15.647
They all traded
in their own specialties -

02:15.800 --> 02:19.361
prostitution, sly grog...

02:22.800 --> 02:24.564
and two-up.

02:27.400 --> 02:32.167
But they all had one thing
in common - cocaine.

02:41.560 --> 02:43.085
Like Kate and Tilly,

02:43.240 --> 02:45.447
Phil Jeffs
was at the top of his game.

02:49.160 --> 02:52.403
But Phil The Jew
was about to come unstuck,

02:52.560 --> 02:54.562
and not for cocaine or two-up,

02:54.720 --> 02:58.406
but for something no-one could possibly
have imagined.

03:02.280 --> 03:04.009
Help me!

03:04.160 --> 03:05.650
Ma'am?

03:05.800 --> 03:07.370
I've been...

03:08.440 --> 03:10.647
I've been raped!

03:14.640 --> 03:16.324
There were three of them.

03:16.480 --> 03:19.609
She's...
No prostitute. Two small kids.

03:19.760 --> 03:21.762
Walking home after dinner
with her aunt and uncle

03:21.920 --> 03:23.684
when these animals dragged her
off the street.

03:23.840 --> 03:26.525
It was two hours before she got away
from them.

03:26.680 --> 03:28.887
What's this town coming to?

03:29.040 --> 03:31.646
She described her attackers.
A mother, an ordinary woman.

03:31.800 --> 03:34.326
It's bad enough when they confine
their activities to street women.

03:34.480 --> 03:35.322
But this...

03:35.480 --> 03:37.528
I think one of them
might have been Phillip Jeffs.

03:38.680 --> 03:40.170
Jeffs?

03:41.160 --> 03:44.482
Get him. Get everyone
associated with him.

03:46.520 --> 03:50.605
When arrested, suspects were required
to give their professions

03:50.760 --> 03:54.242
or the police would charge them
with vagrancy.

04:06.640 --> 04:10.247
William Archer actually did run
William's Archer's bath house,

04:10.400 --> 04:13.131
but that didn't exactly make him
legitimate.

04:14.440 --> 04:17.284
And Leslie Heath really was
a share broken

04:17.440 --> 04:21.445
but everyone was about to find out
what else he was.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.364
Him.
What?

04:28.520 --> 04:30.727
I've never seen her bef...
Shut up.

04:33.720 --> 04:35.290
Who else?

04:36.320 --> 04:38.209
Take your time.

04:46.360 --> 04:48.727
That man there.
Can he say something?

04:48.880 --> 04:51.247
Can he say âmy beautiful babyâ?

04:52.880 --> 04:54.211
My beautiful baby.

04:54.360 --> 04:56.966
He was one of them.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.202
Anyone else?

05:00.640 --> 05:02.130
Can they turn around?

05:03.360 --> 05:04.850
You heard the lady.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.606
That ain't no lady.

05:13.440 --> 05:15.841
Can their hats be taken off?

05:16.000 --> 05:17.206
Fuck!

05:18.840 --> 05:19.841
Hats.

05:42.480 --> 05:43.970
Him.

05:55.160 --> 05:57.925
Are you disputing this woman's version
of events?

06:02.640 --> 06:05.723
How'd you even cross paths
with Mrs Maddocks?

06:08.560 --> 06:10.801
You said you were at the dentist
that morning.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.808
Until 1927,

06:15.960 --> 06:19.806
you could buy cocaine legally
from chemists and dentists.

06:19.960 --> 06:23.248
The Dangerous Drugs Act
changed all that.

06:23.400 --> 06:27.883
But Phil Jeffs found a way
to make the new laws work for him.

06:28.040 --> 06:31.442
That's a fine piece of workmanship
there, Mr Jeffs.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.251
Who was the artisan,
if you don't mind me asking?

06:34.400 --> 06:36.323
You wouldn't know him.
It's a London job.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.721
Some time ago, I'd hazard a guess.

06:38.880 --> 06:43.283
It's slightly smaller -
before your jaw was fully developed.

06:43.440 --> 06:45.329
Yeah. I was 15.
Ah!

06:45.480 --> 06:47.528
You know your business,
don't you, Doctor?

06:47.680 --> 06:49.409
You heard of mine, then?

06:49.560 --> 06:52.370
I believe you have an arrangement

06:52.520 --> 06:54.090
with some from my profession.

06:54.240 --> 06:57.961
Right. And might you be interested
in joining that arrangement?

06:59.440 --> 07:01.329
The laws have changed.

07:01.480 --> 07:04.245
Cocaine's not legal any more.

07:04.400 --> 07:07.483
But you dentists are allowed
two ounces a year

07:07.640 --> 07:09.051
through Customs, though, ain't ya?

07:09.200 --> 07:12.488
Although I believe you lads use
novocaine these days,

07:12.640 --> 07:17.771
which must leave a lot of snow
lying about without any friends.

07:18.880 --> 07:21.087
He's gonna have a page for you
tomorrow, 3:00,

07:21.240 --> 07:22.730
and then one a month.

07:22.880 --> 07:25.645
That's 17 dentists now, ain't it?
Starting to lose track.

07:27.200 --> 07:28.531
What?

07:28.680 --> 07:30.364
These dentists are getting nervous.

07:30.520 --> 07:33.285
Might have to look into
other avenues.

07:33.440 --> 07:35.169
Other avenues?
Yeah.

07:35.320 --> 07:37.084
Direct importation off the docks.

07:37.240 --> 07:39.129
What, from your ching-Chong
sailor mate?

07:39.280 --> 07:41.567
No, I ain't talking about
a couple of ounces here and there.

07:41.720 --> 07:43.848
I'm talking pounds, and all at once.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.729
Need a bit of dosh for that,
wouldn't you?

07:45.880 --> 07:47.609
Yes.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.364
And where did you go after that?

07:50.920 --> 07:54.925
The things you say
and the questions you ask,

07:55.080 --> 07:57.128
they don't interest me.

07:58.640 --> 08:00.688
You're not going anywhere.

08:06.360 --> 08:07.850
Hit me again.

08:08.920 --> 08:11.002
You work this shitty job
for another hundred years,

08:11.160 --> 08:13.925
you won't make what I do in a month.

08:14.080 --> 08:19.610
So come on, hit me,
'cause it's all you got.

08:25.320 --> 08:26.810
Sarge!

08:31.080 --> 08:33.128
Allow me.

08:41.840 --> 08:44.525
So they dragged you off
the Bayswater Road

08:44.680 --> 08:46.569
and into the King's Lynn flats.

08:46.720 --> 08:50.964
They each had relations with you,
and then?

08:55.520 --> 08:57.204
They, um...

08:59.160 --> 09:01.401
What?
I...

09:01.560 --> 09:03.050
What did they do?

09:03.200 --> 09:05.965
What would be worse
than what was done already?

09:15.880 --> 09:19.168
I don't get it.
I don't like it and I don't get it.

09:22.760 --> 09:24.330
How does she look?

09:24.480 --> 09:27.211
Strong. She'll be a good witness.

09:27.360 --> 09:30.204
Are we really gonna run
with this, Bill?

09:31.200 --> 09:33.851
It's one woman's word against three.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.082
Oh, so if she's raped by one,
we charge him,

09:36.240 --> 09:37.924
and if there's a group
we let them go?

09:38.080 --> 09:41.448
No, it's just I'm saying this is a tough
case to put at the best of times.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.011
I know.

09:43.160 --> 09:44.730
Keep me informed.

09:49.920 --> 09:52.685
Sir, do you mind me asking...

09:53.880 --> 09:56.042
I've brought five rape cases
to you in the past year.

09:56.200 --> 09:57.804
Why this one?

09:57.960 --> 09:59.689
This one we can win.

09:59.840 --> 10:01.888
Because she's not a prostitute,
you mean?

10:03.200 --> 10:06.124
Take that up with the bloke
who made the world the way it is.

10:06.280 --> 10:07.645
Or the Woman.

10:07.800 --> 10:10.121
No woman would have made
a world like this.

10:17.320 --> 10:19.243
Mr Jeffs, how do you respond
to these allegations?

10:34.280 --> 10:36.089
In a case
that is being referred to

10:36.240 --> 10:38.242
as 'the Darlinghurst Outrage ',

10:38.400 --> 10:41.483
the three men were charged with having
attacked Ida Mavis Maddocks

10:41.640 --> 10:42.971
against her will,

10:43.120 --> 10:46.010
committing a capital crime
when they dragged her off the street

10:46.160 --> 10:49.369
and subjected her to two hours
of sexual degradation.

10:49.520 --> 10:52.729
Leslie Heath was further charged
with a nauseating of fence,

10:52.880 --> 10:54.211
brutally outrageous...

10:54.360 --> 10:57.728
âBrutally outrageous
and unprintable in nature. â

10:57.880 --> 11:00.645
Should charge extra for that.

11:00.800 --> 11:02.484
Blind Freddy can see she's a pro.

11:02.640 --> 11:06.440
She set him up?
Yeah, or somebody paid her to.

11:07.480 --> 11:09.960
You don't think Kate fucking Leigh's
behind this, do you?

11:10.120 --> 11:11.565
Rape's a capital crime.

11:11.720 --> 11:14.291
Phil gets the noose, Kate fucking Leigh
gets the list of dentists.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.761
That conniving bitch!
Why didn't we think of that?

11:16.920 --> 11:18.684
We should get in first.

11:18.840 --> 11:22.049
Jeffs don't move without that young
bloke up his clacker, Ernest.

11:22.200 --> 11:23.804
He'd know who the dentists are.

11:23.960 --> 11:26.122
If Phil swings,
we should offer Ernest a job.

11:26.280 --> 11:29.124
Why don't we wait and see
how it plays out?

11:30.440 --> 11:31.771
Good idea.

11:31.920 --> 11:33.922
We'll let Kate Leigh
do the hard work

11:34.080 --> 11:36.447
and then we'll step in
at the last minute.

11:36.600 --> 11:39.444
Good thinking, Mr Devine.

11:39.600 --> 11:42.570
At your service, Mrs Devine.

11:50.240 --> 11:51.969
If Jeffs goes to jail,

11:52.120 --> 11:54.566
that's a big slice of the action
up for grabs.

11:54.720 --> 11:56.484
Eileen, you keep an eye
on that dress.

11:56.640 --> 11:57.971
Got it, Ma.

11:58.120 --> 11:59.849
You could make a play for it.
Yeah.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.764
I could. Eileen.

12:01.920 --> 12:03.285
Yeah, yeah.

12:03.440 --> 12:06.444
An early play and he gets off,
finds out,

12:06.600 --> 12:09.001
then Jeffs is likely to see me
in a poorer light.

12:09.160 --> 12:10.730
A man who holds a grudge, I've heard.

12:10.880 --> 12:12.370
But a late play, too late,

12:12.520 --> 12:14.807
and someone else is gonna
get in first.

12:14.960 --> 12:16.041
Someone?
Yeah.

12:16.200 --> 12:19.283
Some slapper slut from London,
just for argument's sake.

12:19.440 --> 12:21.363
Oh, for God's sake!

12:22.560 --> 12:24.369
You never give me half a chance, Ma!

12:24.520 --> 12:26.045
Oh, and you wonder why!

12:26.200 --> 12:30.171
God. And I'm not buying you
another one!

12:36.480 --> 12:37.970
Man might need a friend right now.

12:38.120 --> 12:42.125
Mm? Could be
grateful for it later on.

12:44.840 --> 12:46.365
That's my girl.

12:53.880 --> 12:55.405
Kate.

12:57.400 --> 13:00.244
To what do I owe
the inimitable pleasure?

13:02.360 --> 13:04.249
I just, uh...

13:06.040 --> 13:10.523
I wanted you to know that
I don't care what the papers say.

13:10.680 --> 13:14.127
In my book, innocent
till they string you up.

13:15.360 --> 13:17.840
Soto speak.
Huh. Thank you.

13:20.520 --> 13:21.885
I didn't do it, Kate.

13:22.040 --> 13:25.726
Well, why'd she lie, then,
put you in it?

13:25.880 --> 13:28.121
Well, to be honest, I thought
it might be you or Tilly.

13:28.280 --> 13:30.681
Me? No.

13:30.840 --> 13:33.241
With Bruhn gone,
we're the main players now -

13:33.400 --> 13:35.084
you, me, the Devines.

13:37.480 --> 13:41.007
Murder's messy, so we found out.

13:41.160 --> 13:44.801
But this, I mean, this,
stroke of genius.

13:44.960 --> 13:49.045
I get the noose,
one less player.

13:50.560 --> 13:53.803
It wasn't me, I swear to you.

13:55.040 --> 13:57.725
And I did not rape that woman.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.450
I promise you.

14:09.320 --> 14:10.970
I promise you.

14:18.840 --> 14:21.002
What position was she in
that she could identify Jeffs

14:21.160 --> 14:22.571
from the back of his head?

14:22.720 --> 14:24.370
If anyone would know, sweetheart.
Exactly.

14:24.520 --> 14:27.444
And I can't even imagine.
âScandalously treated. â

14:27.600 --> 14:29.125
Look at this.

14:30.560 --> 14:33.245
There's the iron.
I ain't ironing.

14:35.400 --> 14:38.131
Fine. I'll do it.

14:38.280 --> 14:40.521
You can read me the rest.

14:45.960 --> 14:47.610
She don't look too happy.

14:48.960 --> 14:50.803
She doesn't look like a moll, either.

14:50.960 --> 14:52.450
She's not. She's a housewife.

14:52.600 --> 14:55.365
Come on, what happened
in the line-up?

14:57.800 --> 14:59.484
The writing's a little small.

15:01.760 --> 15:03.125
You can't read.

15:03.280 --> 15:06.523
Tiny writing's all. Can't they say what
happened without all them words?

15:06.680 --> 15:08.250
You know what?

15:09.880 --> 15:12.884
Let's just forget about
the paper, huh?

15:13.040 --> 15:16.328
And let's see what position
we can get into

15:16.480 --> 15:19.848
where I can see the back
of your neck.

15:24.520 --> 15:26.568
I heard Phil was horse-whipped once.

15:26.720 --> 15:28.643
Phil?
Mm-hm.

15:28.800 --> 15:32.361
He's so... elegant.
Yeah.

15:32.520 --> 15:34.409
What happened?

15:34.560 --> 15:36.449
Pickpocketing.

15:36.600 --> 15:38.807
He picked the wrong pocket.

15:38.960 --> 15:41.486
This laborer, enormous bloke.

15:41.640 --> 15:44.689
Got out a whip and slashed Phil across
the back twice.

15:44.840 --> 15:48.526
So Phil The Jew took out his pistol,
fired three times.

15:48.680 --> 15:51.251
Missed every time.
He killed a girl too, you know.

15:51.400 --> 15:53.129
Eva O'Grady, her name was.

15:53.280 --> 15:55.442
That's right, the car crash.

15:55.600 --> 15:58.444
Driving back from a picnic,
eight of them in the car.

15:58.600 --> 16:00.682
The Jew took the turn too fast.

16:00.840 --> 16:02.683
When he woke up
on the side of the road

16:02.840 --> 16:05.491
she was lying next to him,
dead eyes staring up at the sky.

16:05.640 --> 16:08.291
Enough gossiping!
It's true, Nellie says.

16:08.440 --> 16:09.805
Phil The Jew is a businessman.

16:09.960 --> 16:12.850
Why would he pickpocket someone
only two years ago?

16:13.000 --> 16:15.890
Why rape Ida Maddocks if
he can have any woman he wants?

16:16.040 --> 16:20.204
Yeah. Just goes to show.
Both stories are nonsense.

16:20.360 --> 16:21.771
He was charged with
the pickpocketing

16:21.920 --> 16:25.049
and the shooting
and the car accident, Nellie says.

16:25.200 --> 16:28.522
Oh, well, if Nellie says.

16:33.800 --> 16:36.406
How much of what this Maddocks
woman says is true?

16:36.560 --> 16:39.609
What does it matter?
Who's gonna believe her?

16:39.760 --> 16:41.603
The police, for starters.

16:41.760 --> 16:45.128
They seem to have a real bee in their
bonnet about you, Mr Jeffs.

16:45.280 --> 16:46.930
Yeah. They're always after me.

16:47.080 --> 16:49.321
What can they prove?

16:49.480 --> 16:51.448
You don't seem to understand.

16:51.600 --> 16:54.410
She's a mother, a wife.

16:56.240 --> 16:58.846
Her statement, the things
she says you did,

16:59.000 --> 17:01.162
they're gonna make an example
out of you.

17:01.320 --> 17:03.561
This is a capital case, Mr Jeffs.

17:03.720 --> 17:05.688
They will hang you.

17:10.839 --> 17:14.208
What if I said I was there?

17:14.359 --> 17:16.931
And what if I said we paid her?

17:18.040 --> 17:20.361
Then we'd have
something to work with.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.050
There has been a new twist

17:24.200 --> 17:26.009
in the case known as
the Darlinghurst Outrage.

17:26.160 --> 17:28.321
Anonymous sources allege
that Ida Maddocks,

17:28.480 --> 17:29.845
the supposed victim in the matter;

17:30.000 --> 17:32.207
was not an innocent housewife
and mother at all,

17:32.360 --> 17:33.691
but a fallen Woman.

17:33.840 --> 17:36.161
Phil Jeff's defense counsel
will argue

17:36.320 --> 17:38.971
she has taken money from men
on previous occasions.

17:39.120 --> 17:40.963
This proves it!
I was right all along!

17:41.120 --> 17:43.566
Excuse me, sir! Get away from her.

17:44.960 --> 17:48.760
You'll not have the children.
Dorothy will not live with a pros...

17:48.920 --> 17:51.002
This is my husband,
Charles Maddocks.

17:51.160 --> 17:54.209
Well, Mr Maddocks, your attitude
is not helping anyone.

17:54.360 --> 17:57.125
Now, I want you to sit here
while I speak with your wife.

17:59.240 --> 18:00.730
Come through.

18:03.680 --> 18:07.287
They're telling the papers
that I took money, that I consented.

18:07.440 --> 18:09.488
Ignore it.
No surprise they'd lie about it.

18:12.600 --> 18:14.204
That's just the thing. They're not.

18:16.880 --> 18:18.848
How do you think I feed my children?

18:19.000 --> 18:20.889
Charles is a cook,
but he can't get work.

18:21.040 --> 18:22.929
Half a day every two weeks,
if we're lucky.

18:23.080 --> 18:25.845
We hadn't eaten in 24 hours.
I was desperate.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.322
You've done this before?
Why didn't you tell me?

18:29.480 --> 18:33.849
'Cause I couldn't.
You wanted it to be simple.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.526
I wanted you to be truthful.
You're a prostitute?

18:36.680 --> 18:38.250
No, I'm a mother
with two small children

18:38.400 --> 18:40.004
just trying to put food
on the table.

18:41.600 --> 18:43.364
You don't understand. Why would you?

18:43.520 --> 18:47.411
You don't have kids,
you've got a job. You're on easy street.

18:53.720 --> 18:55.210
What happened?

18:57.000 --> 18:58.809
I was walking home.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.888
They offered me Ł2.

19:03.040 --> 19:05.247
I said yes.

19:07.280 --> 19:10.523
Then they did those terrible things.
I didn't ask for that.

19:10.680 --> 19:14.048
I told them to keep their money,
to stop,

19:14.200 --> 19:16.282
but they wouldn't.

19:16.440 --> 19:18.807
What do I do?

19:24.960 --> 19:26.450
Wait here.

19:50.040 --> 19:51.804
You said no.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.689
But before no I said yes.

19:54.840 --> 19:57.081
You stick to your story.
You said no.

19:57.240 --> 19:59.846
It's not the truth.
Did these men rape you?

20:00.000 --> 20:01.923
Yes.

20:02.080 --> 20:04.367
That's the truth.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.201
Stan reckons he won't sell us
any more snow.

20:13.360 --> 20:14.691
What's he saying?

20:14.840 --> 20:17.889
It-it's the Ida Maddocks situation.
It's in all the papers.

20:18.040 --> 20:20.088
The publicity.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.885
Don't you want me to beat him up?

20:25.680 --> 20:27.170
Leslie Heath.

20:28.160 --> 20:31.084
That fat prick caused
this whole bleeding mess.

20:57.240 --> 20:59.607
Quit gawking and start pouring.
I don't pay you to watch.

20:59.760 --> 21:01.364
You hardly pay me at all!

21:01.520 --> 21:03.045
Ah, Phil. Been a while.

21:03.200 --> 21:05.931
Well, I am a busy man...

21:06.080 --> 21:07.570
Mrs Leigh.

21:08.760 --> 21:10.205
Drinks for the gentlemen.

21:10.360 --> 21:14.081
Yeah. Better make it one more.
Double.

21:14.240 --> 21:16.208
Friend of yours?

21:16.360 --> 21:19.011
Yeah, sort of.

21:19.160 --> 21:22.209
More like a cash cow
waiting to be milked, really.

21:23.960 --> 21:25.962
Leslie, lovely to meet you. Welcome.

21:26.120 --> 21:28.202
Come right in, we've got
a lovely table over here.

21:28.360 --> 21:31.045
So business is good?

21:31.200 --> 21:33.931
It's the stock market-
license to print money.

21:34.080 --> 21:35.411
What can go wrong?

21:35.560 --> 21:37.449
Hmm.

21:37.600 --> 21:39.921
Perhaps you might know
some cashed-up fellas

21:40.080 --> 21:43.971
who are interested in investing
in some less... orthodox stock.

21:44.120 --> 21:46.168
Name the figure.

21:46.320 --> 21:47.685
Ł1,000.

21:50.680 --> 21:54.810
We buy at Ł1, we sell at 62.

21:54.960 --> 21:56.803
That would make
your profit margin...

21:56.960 --> 21:59.042
Over 5,000%.

22:07.400 --> 22:10.006
For God's sake, Eileen, try to look
half-interested, would you?

22:10.160 --> 22:12.049
So let me do something
interesting, then.

22:12.200 --> 22:13.361
Like what?

22:14.480 --> 22:16.164
Like me run one of your places.

22:18.120 --> 22:19.201
what?

22:19.360 --> 22:21.806
You got half-blind Mavis Jackson
propping up the joint in Palm Lane.

22:21.960 --> 22:24.167
I couldn't do worse than her.

22:28.440 --> 22:31.364
Alright. The cops do a raid,
you're on your own.

22:31.520 --> 22:34.410
I know what to do.
Atrial- one shift only.

22:35.640 --> 22:37.130
Yeah, yeah.

22:41.680 --> 22:43.444
Ah, leaving already, Phil?

22:48.720 --> 22:50.210
Mrs Leigh.

22:56.000 --> 23:00.085
Oh, that fat fella.
Something toady about him.

23:04.560 --> 23:06.005
What do we do
about the dentist?

23:06.160 --> 23:08.242
Forget him. There's plenty more fish
in the sea.

23:08.400 --> 23:09.890
Let's go.

23:10.920 --> 23:11.967
Let's go!

23:14.040 --> 23:17.442
Constable. Your little lady
hasn't told us everything.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.960
Jeffs's defense dug out a matter
in the Central Court

23:21.120 --> 23:22.451
two weeks before the rape.

23:22.600 --> 23:25.570
Charles Maddocks was charged with
threatening to slash his wife.

23:25.720 --> 23:28.291
He accused her of taking money
as a working girl.

23:28.440 --> 23:31.250
Any truth to it?

23:31.400 --> 23:32.890
Not that I know of, sir.

23:33.040 --> 23:36.442
Go badly for the case if defense
can prove she was taking money.

23:36.600 --> 23:39.331
She'll be a good witness, sir.

23:40.600 --> 23:41.931
I hope you're right.

23:42.080 --> 23:46.210
Bloody better be. We've all got
our arses hanging out on this one.

23:59.560 --> 24:01.562
You don't have to babysit me.

24:01.720 --> 24:03.370
Kate wants me here, I'm here.

24:06.640 --> 24:07.971
What are you doing here?

24:08.120 --> 24:11.169
Slumming.
Any objection?

24:11.320 --> 24:13.209
Not if you're paying.

24:13.360 --> 24:15.488
It's all we got here.
At Mum's saloon...

24:15.640 --> 24:18.883
Oh, actually, we're just
on our way there.

24:19.040 --> 24:21.884
Heels are killing me,
so I said to Guido

24:22.040 --> 24:24.042
if we didn't stop somewhere
I wouldn't fuck him.

24:28.920 --> 24:32.811
Phil The Jew. isn't he from Latvia or
something?

24:32.960 --> 24:35.930
Says here he grew up in England.
Hmm.

24:36.080 --> 24:37.809
Does he have family?

24:37.960 --> 24:40.201
I heard he lost them when he was 10.

24:40.360 --> 24:42.010
Lost them?

24:42.160 --> 24:43.491
As Oscar Wilde says,

24:43.640 --> 24:46.564
to lose one parent might
be regarded as unfortunate,

24:46.720 --> 24:48.609
but to lose both...

24:55.640 --> 24:57.483
Ain't this the life, kiddo?

25:21.680 --> 25:24.411
Honest, I can lock up by...

25:24.560 --> 25:26.961
Any chance of a drink, love?

25:27.120 --> 25:29.521
Sorry, we're closed.

25:29.680 --> 25:34.288
I've just come off a 24-hour shift.
Soda ash - kills ya.

25:34.440 --> 25:36.647
Thought a drink might...

25:37.840 --> 25:41.208
Look, you'd be a right champ
if you could help a man out.

25:42.480 --> 25:46.405
You could join me, sweetheart.
No sense a man drinking alone.

25:48.480 --> 25:50.801
I could, maybe. Just the one.

26:04.600 --> 26:06.602
Kate?

26:06.760 --> 26:08.091
Yeah.

26:08.240 --> 26:10.129
Here you are.

26:11.360 --> 26:13.647
Where's Eileen?
She stayed behind to lock up.

26:13.800 --> 26:16.883
You left her? Jesus Christ!

26:19.120 --> 26:22.090
Hard work standing on your feet all day.

26:23.280 --> 26:25.169
Fair dinkum

26:25.320 --> 26:29.609
They had me loading 18 bags
of soda ash in a sling.

26:31.400 --> 26:33.528
What I'd give for a foot rub.

26:33.680 --> 26:37.321
You and me both, darling,
you and me both.

26:42.960 --> 26:44.485
What you doing?

26:47.200 --> 26:48.850
Do you want a fuck or not?

27:00.560 --> 27:02.085
Everyone's carrying 'em.

27:02.240 --> 27:06.370
Protection. Don't know
who's on the streets.

27:06.520 --> 27:08.761
So, your offer.

27:08.920 --> 27:11.207
Still open?

27:13.480 --> 27:15.687
If that Tilly's slashed
me daughter...

27:18.360 --> 27:19.850
What do you think
you're doing here alone?

27:20.000 --> 27:22.241
I earnt 10 shillings.
You could've been cut, robbed.

27:22.400 --> 27:24.687
No, you were supposed to go home
with Gaffney.

27:24.840 --> 27:27.650
There was a customer. He paid
10 shillings, just like Nellie gets.

27:27.800 --> 27:29.609
What, 10 bob for a beer?

27:29.760 --> 27:32.411
Nuh, no, for doing it with me.

27:34.280 --> 27:37.250
I know what to do.
I won't get preggers.

27:40.560 --> 27:43.131
Stupid, stupid girl!

28:03.240 --> 28:05.720
Everything alright?
Course. Why wouldn't it be?

28:12.000 --> 28:13.809
Trial starts tomorrow.

28:13.960 --> 28:17.567
Jeffs. I don't know
why he'd even want to...

28:18.720 --> 28:20.210
do what they're saying.

28:20.360 --> 28:23.011
We don't know. Not for sure.

28:23.160 --> 28:25.128
Look what the papers say.

28:25.280 --> 28:29.080
They say stuff all the time about me.
Sly grog queen, drug queen.

28:29.240 --> 28:31.129
Are they wrong?

28:31.280 --> 28:33.681
If they're right about Jeffs,

28:33.840 --> 28:35.410
he's an animal.

28:35.560 --> 28:37.130
All men are animals.

28:37.280 --> 28:40.329
They drink, they smoke, they fuck.
That's how we make our money.

28:40.480 --> 28:42.209
Because men can't keep it
in their trousers.

28:42.360 --> 28:44.806
Not all men.
All men.

28:46.880 --> 28:49.611
Can you go sleep somewhere else?
I'm sick of your snoring and farting.

29:00.960 --> 29:02.724
You don't need to brush your hair.

29:06.760 --> 29:08.444
What do I need?

29:20.040 --> 29:21.530
I'm a bitch to you.

29:21.680 --> 29:23.170
Sometimes.

29:35.200 --> 29:36.690
Ida?

29:37.800 --> 29:40.041
Your husband?

29:40.200 --> 29:42.123
I'm so sorry.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.886
Best foot forward, eh?

29:46.520 --> 29:47.885
The most sensational trial

29:48.040 --> 29:50.122
in the history of Darlinghurst
begins this morning.

29:50.280 --> 29:52.248
There is standing room only
in the court

29:52.400 --> 29:54.164
as the three now-notorious men,

29:54.320 --> 29:56.561
Phil Jeffs, Ernest Wilson
and Leslie Heath,

29:56.720 --> 29:59.291
face their accuser;
the mother of two smell children,

29:59.440 --> 30:01.522
to answer the shocking charges
against them.

30:01.680 --> 30:04.001
Unlike that bitch not to show.

30:13.600 --> 30:19.801
It is your misfortune to be compelled to
listen to the case known as the...

30:34.680 --> 30:36.170
to be compelled to listen

30:36.320 --> 30:39.403
to the case known as
the Darlinghurst Flat Case...

30:39.560 --> 30:42.769
Who does she think she is?
The Queen of fucking England?

30:42.920 --> 30:47.767
the details of which,
if they are true,

30:47.920 --> 30:51.322
are as filthy as they are atrocious.

31:00.400 --> 31:03.802
I said, for God's sake, let me
go home to my husband and children.

31:05.080 --> 31:06.491
Ernest Wilson said,

31:06.640 --> 31:09.689
You'll go home when we're finished
with you. Keep quiet.

31:12.040 --> 31:17.444
All three of them, separately,
had connection with me.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.207
Phil Jeffs locked the door.

31:27.160 --> 31:30.482
He and Ernest Wilson turned me
onto my stomach,

31:30.640 --> 31:33.086
held me down,

31:33.240 --> 31:34.730
while Leslie Heath...

31:37.560 --> 31:41.042
Leslie Heath
had connection with me.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.570
He was in my back passage.

31:52.400 --> 31:56.485
He held her down?
For that fat toad? Why?

32:18.400 --> 32:20.289
That color is too light for you.

32:20.440 --> 32:22.647
Makes you look like a corpse.

32:24.240 --> 32:27.642
You'd know all about dead people.
You're the killer.

32:27.800 --> 32:29.370
You're not getting his list.

32:29.520 --> 32:31.727
The Jew swings, his business
is coming my way.

32:31.880 --> 32:34.042
He says he didn't do it.

32:34.200 --> 32:36.009
You believe him?

32:37.000 --> 32:38.764
That's why you'll never win, Katie,

32:38.920 --> 32:41.321
'cause you want to think
a person's one thing

32:41.480 --> 32:43.244
when I know they ain't.

32:50.240 --> 32:53.528
You're not denying you were
at the King's Lynn flat that night?

32:53.680 --> 32:54.567
No.

32:54.720 --> 32:56.882
Or that you saw Mrs Maddocks?
No.

32:57.040 --> 32:59.646
But you say you didn't
have relations with her.

32:59.800 --> 33:01.165
Absolutely not.

33:01.320 --> 33:03.084
Because you were only there
for a few minutes.

33:03.240 --> 33:04.571
That's right.

33:04.720 --> 33:07.929
Can you tell the court
the circumstances?

33:08.080 --> 33:11.289
We heard there was a party
at the King's Lynn flat,

33:11.440 --> 33:14.489
but when we arrived it was over.

33:16.720 --> 33:20.486
I saw a woman, who I now know
as a Mrs Maddocks.

33:20.640 --> 33:23.644
She was powdering her face.

33:23.800 --> 33:26.849
I didn't take any notice of her.

33:30.520 --> 33:32.443
I know nothing about the crime.

33:32.600 --> 33:37.447
I never laid a hand on Mrs Maddocks.
I never spoke with Mrs Maddocks.

33:37.600 --> 33:38.931
The only time I saw her

33:39.080 --> 33:41.686
was for a few brief moments
inside the flat.

33:50.280 --> 33:54.569
He's a liar.
He had relations with me.

33:54.720 --> 33:56.529
They all had relations with me.

33:56.680 --> 33:58.011
Oh, God.

33:58.160 --> 34:00.128
Nobody believes me, do they?

34:00.280 --> 34:02.169
The jury, their faces.

34:02.320 --> 34:04.971
That man, Phil Jeffs,

34:05.120 --> 34:06.451
he met me on the street.

34:06.600 --> 34:09.489
It was 9:00. He offered me Ł2.

34:09.639 --> 34:11.960
Why doesn't he admit to even that?

34:12.120 --> 34:17.684
Heath was the one who did...
the most terrible of the acts.

34:17.840 --> 34:20.161
So why is it Phil Jeffs
you're most upset with?

34:24.120 --> 34:25.281
Jury's back.

34:30.360 --> 34:32.408
Will the defendants please rise?

34:37.040 --> 34:40.043
I'd give Ł1 million to find out
what really happened that night.

34:47.159 --> 34:48.969
Oh, what a night, eh?

34:49.120 --> 34:51.600
Hey! What a boozer night!

34:51.760 --> 34:53.569
Yeah, well, if you're interested
in those investments,

34:53.719 --> 34:55.051
it'd be a great night indeed.

34:55.199 --> 34:58.727
What a little sport, hey?

34:58.880 --> 35:00.803
Only one thing could make it better.

35:06.360 --> 35:08.169
Seal the deal.

35:10.360 --> 35:12.522
I'll be wanting my Ł2, please.

35:12.680 --> 35:14.364
How about we make it a fiver'?

35:14.520 --> 35:19.048
Ah, no. My children are at home.
It's late.

35:21.640 --> 35:24.007
No, I'm... done. Thank you.

35:24.160 --> 35:25.491
No, you're not.

35:25.640 --> 35:27.165
Come on.

35:27.320 --> 35:28.321
Be a sport.

35:28.480 --> 35:30.289
There's an extra Ł3 in it
for you.

35:30.440 --> 35:31.771
Please.

35:31.920 --> 35:36.562
Uh-uh! He's only gonna be
two minutes.

35:45.720 --> 35:47.484
Roll her over.

35:49.560 --> 35:51.289
I told you, I want to...

35:56.840 --> 35:58.922
No...

35:59.080 --> 36:01.560
You want this Ł1,000 or not?

36:06.040 --> 36:07.371
No.

36:07.520 --> 36:10.649
No. No.

36:10.800 --> 36:12.643
No!

36:12.800 --> 36:14.484
Let me go!

36:14.640 --> 36:17.291
No! Don't, please.

36:17.440 --> 36:19.249
No!

36:19.400 --> 36:21.004
Come here, my beautiful baby.

36:47.240 --> 36:51.006
Mr Foreman, how do you find
Ernest Wilson?

36:51.160 --> 36:53.049
Guilty or not guilty?

36:54.760 --> 36:55.966
Not guilty.

36:59.520 --> 37:01.682
Leslie Heath?

37:01.840 --> 37:03.171
Not guilty.

37:05.800 --> 37:07.848
Phillip Jeffs?

37:17.720 --> 37:18.846
Not guilty.

37:47.360 --> 37:51.365
Your lucky day.
Indeed.

37:51.520 --> 37:56.162
The strategy Phil Jeffs had
devised with his lawyer had worked.

37:56.320 --> 38:00.450
Casting Ida Maddocks as
a prostitute, a fallen woman,

38:00.600 --> 38:03.001
was enough to sway the jury.

38:03.160 --> 38:06.403
Her courage in testifying
was in vain.

38:07.960 --> 38:11.487
There was only one solution -
witness protection.

38:11.640 --> 38:16.089
Ida Maddocks and her family
were one of the first to be relocated

38:16.240 --> 38:17.810
to another country.

38:17.960 --> 38:21.123
It was the only way
the police could save face.

38:49.480 --> 38:52.211
That verdict made fools
out of all of us.

38:52.360 --> 38:56.410
And you made a fool out of me.
Sir?

38:56.560 --> 38:59.040
You knew that she'd done it before.

38:59.200 --> 39:00.531
It made no difference to the crime.

39:00.680 --> 39:02.728
It made a difference
to whether we could win.

39:03.960 --> 39:05.291
And now they've got away with it,

39:05.440 --> 39:07.249
they'll think they can
get away with anything.

39:09.360 --> 39:10.771
Sir, the Premier's here.

39:10.920 --> 39:14.208
Here? Jesus.

39:14.360 --> 39:15.930
Wait outside.

39:16.080 --> 39:18.924
I'm so sorry, sir.
Tell him it was my fault.

39:19.080 --> 39:21.287
Oh, don't worry. I will.

39:28.160 --> 39:30.970
As if this Government
didn't have enough debt!

39:34.960 --> 39:38.601
This was an unwinnable case!
Why the bloody hell...

39:52.640 --> 39:56.326
My investors, they've decided
to stick with the stock market.

39:57.560 --> 39:59.767
You fey heap of shit.

39:59.920 --> 40:02.207
After all I went through
for you, huh,

40:02.360 --> 40:04.169
you're gonna pull the plug now, then,
are you?

40:04.320 --> 40:07.563
It's the publicity.
They're nervous.

40:07.720 --> 40:09.210
Their reputations.

40:12.600 --> 40:15.331
I'll tell you what.

40:15.480 --> 40:17.244
You stick with the stock market,

40:17.400 --> 40:19.607
but might I suggest
a change of climate?

40:19.760 --> 40:22.491
London? Wall Street?

40:22.640 --> 40:24.802
Yeah, that's more your game,
isn't it?

40:24.960 --> 40:27.725
But I live...
Somewhere else.

40:27.880 --> 40:32.568
'Cause if you stay in this town,
you're a dead man.

40:36.800 --> 40:38.404
Ha!

40:38.560 --> 40:41.689
Now, I've got a reputation
here too, you know,

40:41.840 --> 40:45.208
and it ain't helped
by having your fat face around

40:45.360 --> 40:50.207
reminding people of stuff
they'd rather forget.

40:50.360 --> 40:52.408
You understand me?

41:02.880 --> 41:05.406
Can't count on people, Ernest.

41:06.800 --> 41:08.802
Money's the only thing
that won't lie to you.

41:08.960 --> 41:10.450
What about family?

41:13.040 --> 41:15.361
Especially not family.

41:30.320 --> 41:32.766
Wait here, darling. We'll be back.

41:32.920 --> 41:34.524
We'll be back, I promise you.

41:34.680 --> 41:37.411
Daddy and I are just going off
for a minute.

41:39.760 --> 41:42.366
Mummy, don't leave me.

41:42.520 --> 41:46.161
We'll be back, I promise you.

42:25.680 --> 42:28.763
We'll be back, I promise you.
