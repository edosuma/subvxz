WEBVTT

00:01.794 --> 00:03.252
Previously on Nurse Jackie...

00:03.337 --> 00:05.588
Kaitlyn and Fi touched them
with their bare hands

00:05.673 --> 00:07.423
and filled them full of their bacteria.

00:07.508 --> 00:10.426
Washing your hands every two minutes
is kind of crazy if you ask me.

00:10.511 --> 00:11.719
That's a lot.

00:11.804 --> 00:14.263
"Number 23.
All Saints Hospital,

00:14.348 --> 00:17.141
-"Dr. Fitch Cooper"?
-How did this happen?

00:17.226 --> 00:20.061
We want to launch a citywide campaign

00:20.562 --> 00:23.314
featuring you as the face of All Saints.

00:23.399 --> 00:26.609
You know Sarah Khouri?
God, I could not love her more.

00:26.694 --> 00:29.612
Yeah, well... Get in line.

00:29.697 --> 00:32.323
When I get nervous,
I act out with inappropriate sexual touches.

00:32.408 --> 00:33.783
It's like Tourette's.

00:33.867 --> 00:38.079
You and me, tonight, third-base line.

00:38.622 --> 00:41.582
-I think I'm pregnant.
-Wow.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.752
Are you jealous of Ginny Flynn?

00:45.170 --> 00:48.172
-You're overreacting.
-No, I am reacting.

00:48.257 --> 00:50.007
I get to react, okay?

02:21.642 --> 02:24.477
Coffee, black with a little milk.

02:25.521 --> 02:26.938
God, I love this place.

02:27.022 --> 02:29.232
You always remember
how I take my coffee.

02:29.316 --> 02:32.443
Yes. I remember all things
that pertain to her.

02:33.695 --> 02:36.113
I like your new sheets, very soft.

02:36.198 --> 02:39.784
I'm glad you worked through
your cotton-poly-blend phase.

02:39.868 --> 02:42.370
Stick around, you'll learn
all kinds of things about me.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.998
Now I forget,
you have heard of CDs, right?

02:46.583 --> 02:49.293
You hear that? You hear those lows?

02:50.587 --> 02:54.048
-Digital is bullshit.
-I guess.

02:54.716 --> 02:59.011
I pretty much stopped listening to music
when the Teletubbies moved into my home.

02:59.096 --> 03:00.721
That's funny.

03:00.806 --> 03:03.724
-You know the Teletubbies?
-I'm a cultured man.

03:04.351 --> 03:05.810
I shouldn't talk about my kids.

03:05.894 --> 03:08.271
Why not? It's your life.
What are you gonna talk about?

03:08.355 --> 03:11.399
Yes, it is. My fabulous life.

03:12.609 --> 03:14.777
-Give me an example.
-Of what?

03:14.862 --> 03:17.905
What you do. What's tonight?

03:19.908 --> 03:21.075
Come on.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.286
Let's see.

03:23.370 --> 03:26.581
Tonight, Gracie is having a sleepover
with her friend Kaitlyn.

03:27.332 --> 03:30.334
-You do not like Kaitlyn.
-No, I do not.

03:30.419 --> 03:32.670
How about Kevin? What's he up to?

03:34.256 --> 03:38.217
-Okay. That I can't do.
-I'm sorry.

03:38.802 --> 03:43.639
This thing with you guys hanging out,
it's very cute, but it's gotta stop.

03:43.724 --> 03:46.809
Got it. I got a couple of Roxies
laying around if you want them.

03:46.894 --> 03:49.186
No. My back's pretty good actually.

03:52.608 --> 03:55.276
And FYI,

03:56.278 --> 03:59.906
I am here because I like you,
not because you have drugs.

04:00.699 --> 04:02.366
You like me, huh?

04:04.161 --> 04:06.537
-What do you want me to say, Eddie?
-What do you think?

04:07.247 --> 04:08.623
I gotta go.

04:14.796 --> 04:16.088
See you.

04:20.177 --> 04:21.218
-Hey.
-Hey.

04:21.303 --> 04:23.888
-That smells good.
-How was work?

04:26.475 --> 04:29.185
You know, fine. Crazy.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.354
Did you pick up the movies?

04:31.438 --> 04:35.566
Shit. Honey, no, I'm sorry. I didn't.
You know what? I'll go get them now.

04:35.651 --> 04:38.569
No, no, no, it's fine. You're here.
Just stay here.

04:38.654 --> 04:41.030
-Take over for me, please.
-All right.

04:42.157 --> 04:44.700
Okay, girls. Corn's ready.

04:52.793 --> 04:56.963
-Dad, can I have a Coke?
-Negative.

04:57.047 --> 04:59.256
Hi, Grace, honey. Thanks for asking.
My day was fine.

04:59.341 --> 05:00.633
Popcorn!

05:01.385 --> 05:03.594
-Kaitlyn tripped me!
-No, I didn't.

05:03.679 --> 05:05.054
Okay, let me take a look.

05:05.806 --> 05:08.224
This kitchen stinks.
I think you're burning it.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.934
-It's better that way.
-No, it's not.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.060
Well, it's better than nothing.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.687
You look okay to me, kiddo.

05:12.771 --> 05:15.231
It's a good thing. I didn't feel like
setting any broken bones tonight.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.818
I want a broken bone
with a cast on my arm!

05:18.902 --> 05:21.070
I could get one for my birthday.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.072
Retarded.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.032
Kaitlyn! Be nice.

05:25.283 --> 05:27.618
Okay, cranberry or apple juice?

05:27.703 --> 05:29.036
-Cranberry.
-I don't care.

05:29.121 --> 05:31.455
-Coke?
-No, Fi. No Coke.

05:36.086 --> 05:38.921
Hey, do you still wear diapers?

05:42.384 --> 05:44.510
Kaitlyn, honey, listen to me.

05:45.637 --> 05:47.555
Shut the fuck up.

06:20.881 --> 06:21.964
What?

06:27.554 --> 06:28.679
What?

06:30.098 --> 06:31.974
She is not a nice kid.

06:33.685 --> 06:36.979
Her home life is a mess.
Might want to lighten up.

06:40.192 --> 06:42.526
Do you know what happened
to my Joni Mitchell albums?

06:42.611 --> 06:43.694
Nope.

07:14.643 --> 07:15.893
Fuck.

07:18.230 --> 07:20.731
Motorcycle accident, ETA two minutes!

07:20.816 --> 07:24.652
Let's focus, people!
Can we move a little faster?

07:24.736 --> 07:28.239
Zoey, go easy, honey.
They're fine, they're okay.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.327
Not seeing a lot of people on their toes!

07:34.871 --> 07:36.872
Other than Jackie and me.

07:40.502 --> 07:44.505
Geez. I'm sorry. I gotta go, and not pee.

07:45.841 --> 07:47.925
-I can't wipe.
-Jackie.

07:48.009 --> 07:49.552
-Zoey.
-Sam!

07:51.847 --> 07:54.765
-Hey, are you the guy on the bus stops?
-You saw that?

07:55.892 --> 07:57.852
You're a doctor, huh?
I thought you were a model.

07:57.936 --> 08:00.813
-I mean, you look like a model.
-Well, thank you.

08:01.690 --> 08:06.152
-Jealous much, Jackie?
-"If looks could cure." No, I'm good.

08:06.236 --> 08:10.030
I am doing what it takes to bring the sick
and the injured into this hospital

08:10.115 --> 08:11.448
so that I can cure them.

08:11.533 --> 08:14.702
Call Ortho. Tell them the face of All Saints
is just about done here.

08:14.786 --> 08:16.078
You've got to give him a hand
in the bathroom.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.539
-I told you to do it.
-She's got a code coming in.

08:20.500 --> 08:24.253
-We all set? Everybody happy?
-I'm happy if you're happy.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.298
34-year-old female,
lost control of her motorcycle on the FDR.

08:27.382 --> 08:30.551
Running two large-bore IVs,
wide open, 69 over 40.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.845
Get respiratory with a vent.
All right, who's with me?

08:32.929 --> 08:35.264
Transfer. Ready. One, two, three.

08:36.057 --> 08:37.641
-Who's working my lines?
-Zoey.

08:37.726 --> 08:40.978
-Me, certainly, right now.
-That leg's a bit humpty-dumpty.

08:41.062 --> 08:44.148
Probably massive internal bleeding. Shit.

08:44.232 --> 08:46.525
-Name, what's her name?
-Jennifer.

08:46.610 --> 08:49.737
Jennifer, are you with us?
Can you hear me?

08:49.821 --> 08:52.239
-I'm still here.
-What's that, honey?

08:54.117 --> 08:56.702
-Where am I?
-You're in All Saints Hospital.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.287
You've been in an accident.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.372
-I'm fucking alive?
-Yes, you are.

09:00.457 --> 09:03.667
-We're gonna take very good care of you.
-No. Fuck. Please don't.

09:03.752 --> 09:05.669
We're gonna get you out
of pain first, okay?

09:05.754 --> 09:07.213
Good fucking luck.

09:07.297 --> 09:11.175
-Can I have 100 of Sux and 40 of Etomidate?
-Sux and Etomidate.

09:11.259 --> 09:12.426
Zoey, call the OR.

09:14.012 --> 09:17.973
"All gave some, some gave all."
Wow, she's in the service.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.392
Zoey, call the OR. Now.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.187
Bet her spleen is all but shot.

09:23.271 --> 09:25.231
-You don't need your spleen.
-Actually, Zoey, you do.

09:25.315 --> 09:27.274
She's right. Incredibly.

09:27.609 --> 09:30.027
New research says spleens
produce all the monocytes.

09:30.111 --> 09:32.363
Hugs for the continuing education,
Dr. Cooper.

09:32.447 --> 09:33.864
You'll let us know the next big thing,
won't you?

09:33.949 --> 09:35.741
At least I get my information
from medical journals,

09:35.825 --> 09:37.993
not from AOL like Jackie.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.453
Well, he's got me there.

09:42.791 --> 09:44.291
-Hi, are you Trey?
-Yeah.

09:44.376 --> 09:47.086
Hi, Dr. O'Hara wanted me to update you.

09:47.170 --> 09:50.381
We are doing everything we can,
but I'm not gonna blue-sky you.

09:50.465 --> 09:53.467
She has a ruptured spleen
and that's not good.

09:57.597 --> 09:58.681
Okay.

10:12.696 --> 10:15.572
Excuse me. Excuse me.

10:16.324 --> 10:17.574
No one's allowed over the yellow line.

10:17.659 --> 10:20.744
Sorry. Hi, Tony Frambi. I'm with Cellulab.

10:20.829 --> 10:22.579
We are overrun with you guys.

10:22.664 --> 10:23.956
If I could...

10:25.834 --> 10:28.794
Nurse Peyton, just leave you
with a few samples. It's my first day.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.421
It's not gonna work. Thank you anyway.

10:30.505 --> 10:33.090
Flopro is new for incontinence,
excellent results.

10:33.174 --> 10:35.592
And Joyfulax is a real
up-and-comer for depression.

10:35.677 --> 10:38.304
Okay, this is an ER, Tony.
People don't come here 'cause they're sad.

10:38.388 --> 10:41.140
I mean, they do, but that's not...

10:41.891 --> 10:43.517
You know what's exciting? Capsaicin.

10:43.601 --> 10:47.104
Studies show that it treats neuropathic pain
better than any barbiturate in its class.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.482
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

10:55.822 --> 10:58.490
-Can I see the studies?
-Yeah. I'll bring them by tomorrow.

10:58.575 --> 11:00.951
-That's too much.
-Please, I have plenty.

11:01.036 --> 11:02.619
Okay, that's... I don't... That's good.

11:02.704 --> 11:04.371
-Okay. It's fine.
-Okay.

11:04.456 --> 11:06.457
-See you tomorrow.
-Okay.

11:36.279 --> 11:37.696
You believe this?

11:38.365 --> 11:41.241
-Who knew women could be such pigs?
-Me.

11:47.665 --> 11:52.252
Chart for the motorcycle crash,
the girl with the ruptured spleen.

11:52.337 --> 11:53.879
Poor spleen.

11:54.422 --> 11:57.674
Minding its own business, then... Bam!

11:57.759 --> 12:01.762
Call it a day. Life as you know it is over.

12:02.347 --> 12:03.806
Over.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.943
Zoey, get back here.

12:18.196 --> 12:21.865
I don't know if it's hormones
or fear of being a mother or what,

12:21.950 --> 12:23.409
but you're getting a little weird.

12:24.160 --> 12:28.539
-First of all, have you had a pregnancy test?
-No. No. Unnecessary.

12:28.957 --> 12:31.291
-And why is that?
-I'm pregnant.

12:31.376 --> 12:34.920
-And you know this how?
-I know my body

12:36.673 --> 12:39.091
pretty well and they're...

12:42.137 --> 12:44.263
Jackie, walk with me, please.

12:48.184 --> 12:52.396
The good news is our endowment's intact
even though our revenues are down.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.690
-The bad news is...
-The bad news is under your arm.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.733
Don't speak. Listen.

12:56.818 --> 12:59.903
If anyone knows what a crock
of shit this is, it's me.

12:59.988 --> 13:03.323
But the hospital needs this to work,
so get behind it.

13:03.408 --> 13:05.909
Why are we advertising
inside the hospital, Gloria?

13:05.994 --> 13:07.077
The patients are already here.

13:07.162 --> 13:09.455
This is not our field of expertise, Jackie.

13:09.539 --> 13:12.458
Our PR people have
a multi-pronged strategy.

13:12.542 --> 13:14.751
This is one of the prongs.

13:14.836 --> 13:20.466
They may not look like much to you,
but each of these costs $286.

13:20.550 --> 13:24.636
Vandalizing or disfiguring any Dr. Coopers
will be met by a shit storm.

13:24.721 --> 13:26.263
Don't test me.

13:30.602 --> 13:34.229
Jacks. To think all of this
could've been yours.

13:35.106 --> 13:36.315
Ladies.

13:38.443 --> 13:40.360
Who's the handsome guy?

13:41.196 --> 13:45.115
It may be my face, but it's our body.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.159
Speaking of our body,
what's wrong with it?

13:47.243 --> 13:49.912
It doesn't appear to be quite life-size,
does it, Dr. Cooper?

13:52.373 --> 13:54.208
-That is weird.
-It's more than weird.

13:54.292 --> 13:57.252
-I'd say it's a travesty.
-It's a tiny little travesty.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.587
Miniature, really.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.172
You think I'm stupid?

14:00.256 --> 14:03.717
Fortunately, the face of All Saints
is not petty.

14:13.394 --> 14:14.520
What?

14:15.104 --> 14:16.522
Turn around.

14:19.442 --> 14:22.694
-You said you'd call.
-I lied.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.456
God, what's wrong with me?

14:34.541 --> 14:36.500
-This is Jackie?
-You told her about me?

14:36.584 --> 14:38.502
Come on, what else would I talk about?

14:38.586 --> 14:40.754
Where are we going for lunch?
Not Barneys.

14:40.838 --> 14:43.840
-Jackie, you pick.
-Oh, no, I can't go to lunch. Thank you.

14:43.925 --> 14:45.592
There's sick people all over the place.

14:45.677 --> 14:47.761
There's one right over there
I've gotta deal with right now.

14:53.351 --> 14:55.143
Exactly how drunk were we?

14:55.228 --> 14:59.189
I don't know, but we talk our way
onto an American military slope

14:59.274 --> 15:00.941
in the Bavarian fucking Alps

15:01.025 --> 15:05.028
-and we tell them that we're colonels' wives.
-You did. I was a general's wife.

15:05.113 --> 15:07.030
You were a general's wife, I'm sorry.

15:07.115 --> 15:08.865
But we're in the line for the lift

15:08.950 --> 15:10.826
and we just can't keep our hands
off each other.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.744
We were a bit grabby!

15:13.538 --> 15:14.788
-You guys.
-I'd say!

15:15.623 --> 15:17.958
We ended up telling this gawking sergeant

15:18.042 --> 15:21.211
that our husbands had been deployed
in Kosovo for over a year

15:21.296 --> 15:22.921
and we're just consoling each other.

15:23.006 --> 15:24.923
We're just consoling each other.

15:30.847 --> 15:34.766
-God. You're settling in Washington?
-That's what they tell me.

15:35.310 --> 15:39.313
-That's exciting.
-No, not really. Well, good gig,

15:39.397 --> 15:43.150
but once you've talked your way out
of a drunk general's tent in Mogadishu,

15:43.818 --> 15:47.237
covering congressional hearings
doesn't exactly cut it.

15:47.322 --> 15:51.908
Great. A medieval war has just broken out.
Someone's shot an arrow into a man's lung.

15:52.994 --> 15:55.245
-Cupid is having a bad day.
-I disagree.

15:55.330 --> 15:57.664
-Well, I've got the check.
-Hey, that's absurd!

15:57.749 --> 15:59.833
Come on. In six years of lunches,

15:59.917 --> 16:02.336
I have never seen her leave
so much as a pickle.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.508
Sorry?

16:09.302 --> 16:10.385
No.

16:14.057 --> 16:17.684
-Wow. It really is an arrow.
-Would I lie to you?

16:17.769 --> 16:19.478
Some rich douche bag drank his lunch

16:19.562 --> 16:21.396
and then decided to shoot an arrow
off his roof.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.440
Hang on a minute.
You're going after rich people who drink.

16:23.524 --> 16:25.651
I don't think I like that very much.

16:25.735 --> 16:29.696
Right. Let's call up to radiology
for a CAT scan and a portable chest.

16:29.781 --> 16:31.031
Got it.

16:32.241 --> 16:35.369
-Hey, can I ask you a question about Zoey?
-No.

16:38.164 --> 16:41.249
-Hey, Ronnie, how you doing?
-You believe this?

16:41.918 --> 16:43.794
-It's brand new.
-What's brand new?

16:43.878 --> 16:47.005
-I heard it, but I didn't believe it.
-What?

16:47.090 --> 16:49.216
-Wow.
-Shot by an arrow.

16:49.759 --> 16:52.386
-Standing on Sixth.
-You're here why?

16:52.470 --> 16:53.845
I've never even been mugged.

16:53.930 --> 16:56.640
Wow, check it out. Carbon King.
That's top of the line right there.

16:56.724 --> 16:59.142
-Are you talking about the freaking arrow?
-Okay. Yes.

16:59.227 --> 17:01.937
But my roommate in college
was a member of the archery club,

17:02.021 --> 17:06.817
-so I know a thing or two.
-At the most. Please get out of here.

17:09.237 --> 17:11.321
-It's brand new.
-What, the arrow?

17:11.406 --> 17:13.740
No. The lung.

17:29.757 --> 17:33.218
Heavy is the head that wears the crown,
Dr. Cooper.

17:41.602 --> 17:42.853
I've done the math.

17:42.937 --> 17:45.814
I can cover all your shifts
during your maternity leave

17:45.898 --> 17:47.107
if you cover me.

17:47.191 --> 17:48.650
If you take my shifts,

17:48.735 --> 17:52.821
my mom and I can go to Holland, Michigan
for the Tulip Festival finally.

17:54.699 --> 17:58.994
I told you about my condition
for your support,

17:59.954 --> 18:01.621
not so you can plan a vacation.

18:01.706 --> 18:03.582
I'm putting a bright spin on things.

18:07.295 --> 18:08.628
Hey, hold on a minute.

18:10.590 --> 18:14.968
-Yeah, I can do it.
-Thank you. This has been a dream of ours.

18:15.052 --> 18:18.346
-So, are you close to your mother?
-Not really.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.098
She sold me into slavery when I was four

18:20.183 --> 18:22.601
and I lived on the streets
until a mission intervened.

18:24.687 --> 18:28.023
One year for Halloween, I went as a slave.

18:28.775 --> 18:32.068
Kidding. I grew up in Jersey,
went to Rutgers.

18:32.153 --> 18:34.905
Kidding. By slave I meant Princess Leia.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.828
Fucking motorcycle?

18:45.249 --> 18:49.544
-I'm sorry I curse so much.
-Yeah, well, fuck that.

18:50.171 --> 18:53.840
She serves in the Helmand Province, okay?
Kandahar.

18:54.675 --> 18:58.762
Jesus Christ, what do I tell my kids
if she dies right here at home?

18:58.846 --> 19:01.932
I don't have the answer to that,
but you don't have to cross that bridge yet.

19:02.725 --> 19:07.270
She doesn't sleep, doesn't cry,
barely fucking eats.

19:08.439 --> 19:12.484
She had this bike, like, this Ducati,
like 10 years ago.

19:12.568 --> 19:15.403
Awesome, I mean, awesome motorcycle.

19:17.031 --> 19:18.865
Brad Pitt has one.

19:18.950 --> 19:24.913
So I went out and spent like $8,000
on a kick-ass motorcycle.

19:24.997 --> 19:28.625
Thought it might clear her head. You know?

19:30.294 --> 19:32.128
Yeah, I know. I know.

19:34.215 --> 19:36.508
Now look what I've done.

19:36.926 --> 19:41.221
-God, what did I do?
-You were making her happy.

19:45.351 --> 19:48.937
It was an accident, Trey.
They're called accidents for a reason.

20:15.923 --> 20:17.841
I'm not ready for this.

20:18.634 --> 20:22.220
Being a mother's hard.
You know that already.

20:38.946 --> 20:40.447
Didn't make it.

20:42.950 --> 20:44.200
Bleeding!

20:47.830 --> 20:49.289
My apologies.

20:59.634 --> 21:02.636
-Is she always this...
-Yeah.

21:18.319 --> 21:21.571
-I regret my behavior.
-Good.

21:21.656 --> 21:24.407
But can I just say that
miracles can happen every day?

21:24.492 --> 21:28.161
Yeah, like the day they invented rubbers.
Try using them.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.043
-Hey.
-Hey, how's your day going?

21:35.127 --> 21:37.545
-You know, same old. Yours?
-Good.

21:37.630 --> 21:41.883
So, I'm gonna do the full disclosure thing,
you know, so there's no more confusion.

21:42.218 --> 21:45.512
I'm heading into the city for happy hour.
We're gonna play a little ping-pong.

21:46.013 --> 21:48.682
Well, Jesus, Kevin, I'm not your mom.

21:49.350 --> 21:50.558
-Ping-pong?
-Yeah.

21:50.643 --> 21:54.604
Susan Sarandon opened up a club.
My friend Eddie got us a table.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.778
I know you're leaving,
but I thought you should know

22:01.862 --> 22:05.949
-Mr. Conroy, arrow guy, transplanted lung?
-Yes?

22:06.033 --> 22:08.910
The man who shot him sent his driver in.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.161
Where?

22:21.257 --> 22:25.093
Your boss nearly kills my patient
and he sends his driver in.

22:25.469 --> 22:27.470
There's 8 million people in this fucking city.

22:27.555 --> 22:30.098
What kind of a moron shoots an arrow
off a roof?

22:31.017 --> 22:34.060
The man he hit waited three years
for a lung transplant.

22:34.145 --> 22:35.270
Guess where he got hit?

22:35.354 --> 22:37.814
Ma'am, my boss is a freaking dick.

22:38.566 --> 22:40.316
Can I just ask if the guy's okay?

22:40.401 --> 22:44.237
Well, yes. Miraculously, he is.
Why isn't your dick-of-a-boss in jail?

22:44.321 --> 22:46.906
The reckless endangerment charges
were dismissed.

22:46.991 --> 22:48.658
He's connected.

22:48.743 --> 22:51.327
-So, you're here to apologize?
-No.

22:52.288 --> 22:54.247
I'm here for his arrow.

23:02.006 --> 23:04.007
He's not in there, ma'am.

23:04.759 --> 23:07.177
-This a Mercedes?
-S65 AMG.

23:07.595 --> 23:08.762
Only 15 ever made.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.479
Nice car.

23:18.606 --> 23:22.150
It's really gorgeous. Got heated seats?

23:22.902 --> 23:25.403
What a beautiful piece of machinery!

23:28.074 --> 23:29.491
What kind of mileage you get?

23:31.327 --> 23:32.827
You missed a spot.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.619
Hey, babe.

24:15.996 --> 24:18.581
See what he just did?
Shit, man, that was good.

24:18.666 --> 24:20.917
-Hi, Jackie.
-A little spin on that, huh?

24:21.001 --> 24:22.669
Yeah, a lot of spin. Yeah.

24:23.295 --> 24:24.921
Thirsty? They got like 20 beers on tap.

24:25.005 --> 24:27.048
-Get us a pitcher?
-Yeah. Yeah, let's get a pitcher.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.217
-Yeah?
-Yeah, thanks, man.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.221
-What the hell?
-What?

24:33.305 --> 24:35.890
You told me to stop seeing him.
I never said I would.

24:35.975 --> 24:38.852
-Why, Eddie?
-Hedging my bets a little, I guess.

24:39.353 --> 24:41.354
You lie to me again, I tell him everything.

24:42.690 --> 24:44.816
I see. So you just got the whole thing
figured out then?

24:44.900 --> 24:46.985
As a matter of fact, I do.

24:47.611 --> 24:49.195
Well, I guess we'll see about that,
won't we?

24:50.281 --> 24:52.615
-Here we go.
-All right!

24:53.701 --> 24:55.201
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

25:03.627 --> 25:05.920
-Kick his ass.
-Will do.

25:22.229 --> 25:24.314
You know this is pretend, right?

25:24.398 --> 25:27.817
-How long do I get to keep it on?
-Well, I don't know.

25:28.986 --> 25:32.822
Not just for my birthday,
but past it too, right?

25:32.907 --> 25:34.574
We will see how you do.

25:36.410 --> 25:39.120
Really, Fi? This is really what you want?
Because this is gonna harden up

25:39.205 --> 25:40.747
and you're gonna be stuck with it
for a little bit.

25:40.831 --> 25:42.081
I know.

25:47.755 --> 25:50.173
-Mom?
-Yes, honey.

25:50.841 --> 25:52.967
Nothing's really broken.
