WEBVTT

00:06.005 --> 00:09.926
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:13.972 --> 00:19.978
It was always what I aspired to.
My dream!

00:21.146 --> 00:23.732
Someday, for sure, I'll walk on it, too.

00:25.066 --> 00:27.569
Someday... for sure!

02:05.083 --> 02:06.876
THE GIRL WHO DREAMS

02:06.960 --> 02:11.965
At last, it's time for the "Top Idol Match
'Of Course You Can' Battle!"

02:13.258 --> 02:17.178
Our two contestants will
try their hand at a variety of games!

02:17.262 --> 02:22.016
The winner of each round gets the right
to mark one space in this grid

02:22.100 --> 02:26.604
vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

02:26.688 --> 02:30.316
The first to mark three in a row
will be the winner!

02:30.400 --> 02:32.694
These are the nine games!

02:32.777 --> 02:36.364
Each one is designed
to test your qualities as an idol!

02:36.447 --> 02:40.451
Let's see you bring
your idol A-game to this fight!

02:40.535 --> 02:45.039
As would only be fitting for our academy,
this selection process is also a gamble!

02:45.123 --> 02:50.211
The funds secured for this event amount to
50 million yen. And it's winner take all!

02:53.506 --> 02:55.925
Now, then...
who will emerge victorious, I wonder?

02:56.009 --> 02:58.011
Let's start this competition!

02:58.094 --> 02:58.928
Yeah!

02:59.804 --> 03:00.930
Yumeko...

03:04.475 --> 03:05.894
Why would you do that?

03:06.477 --> 03:10.732
This is most likely the surest way
to get access to the president.

03:11.482 --> 03:15.862
What she said...
What does Yumeko see in all this, exactly?

03:17.196 --> 03:21.159
Yumemi will roll the dice
and determine the first game!

03:21.784 --> 03:23.036
Okay!

03:23.745 --> 03:24.579
There!

03:27.165 --> 03:30.376
Number four! One-on-one Vocal Face-off!

03:31.377 --> 03:34.464
First, you're going to roll
these black and white dice.

03:34.797 --> 03:38.051
Black indicates the tens' place.
White, the ones' place.

03:38.134 --> 03:40.220
We have 100 people in the audience!

03:40.303 --> 03:41.304
SEAT NUMBER 24

03:41.387 --> 03:45.683
We've marked your tickets
with a number from zero to 99.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.810
The audience member who's chosen

03:47.894 --> 03:52.106
will lend us a smartphone,
so we can install a voice evaluator app.

03:53.483 --> 03:59.614
- This is fairer than I thought it'd be.
- All right, the smartphone is ready.

03:59.697 --> 04:02.033
Okay! Yumemi, come on!

04:02.617 --> 04:07.038
All right! Please listen to my song
"Pure Love Poker"!

04:27.058 --> 04:28.476
SCORING IN PROGRESS!

04:28.559 --> 04:32.814
Eighty-five points.
Now, that's quite a high score.

04:34.232 --> 04:39.404
Eighty-five, huh? How did I do
in the scoring system of your hearts?

04:39.487 --> 04:42.240
You get a score of 1.2 million!

04:42.323 --> 04:45.827
Next singer! Yumeko, come on!

04:45.910 --> 04:47.829
Right! I'm going to sing, then.

04:49.580 --> 04:50.665
"Aogeba Toutoshi."

05:14.522 --> 05:16.774
Ninety-eight points!

05:17.358 --> 05:19.694
There we have it! Another high score!

05:20.320 --> 05:22.405
That's 85 vs. 98!

05:22.488 --> 05:26.617
The winner of game number one is Yumeko!

05:26.701 --> 05:29.412
Now, then, which space will you mark?

05:29.495 --> 05:31.080
The center one, please.

05:32.623 --> 05:36.044
Yumeko, that was so amazing!

05:36.127 --> 05:39.672
I'm honored to be complimented
by a professional of the trade!

05:39.756 --> 05:42.216
I need to be on my toes!

05:43.217 --> 05:44.427
Yeah, right.

05:44.510 --> 05:48.848
Truth is, you don't have a prayer
of winning any of these nine games!

05:49.432 --> 05:54.353
If I really bring it, there's no way
I could lose to an amateur like you.

05:54.771 --> 05:57.982
You're going to regret
that you ever disparaged my dreams!

05:58.066 --> 06:02.945
You'll sleep with execs and finish
your career in porn. I'll see to that.

06:03.029 --> 06:06.199
You're going to be the foil
who highlights my integrity!

06:07.700 --> 06:12.288
I'm going to squeeze
every last drop of your life!

06:15.291 --> 06:17.418
Is she actually in trouble?

06:17.502 --> 06:19.629
That must be Yumemite's professionalism.

06:19.712 --> 06:23.633
She's making it look like a heated rivalry
to get everybody fired up.

06:24.717 --> 06:26.636
It's going according to the script?

06:27.261 --> 06:28.262
But, you know,

06:28.346 --> 06:31.557
the one time you think
everything's going your way,

06:31.641 --> 06:35.603
things tend to go spectacularly wrong
behind the scenes, right?

06:35.686 --> 06:38.981
I'm prepared for every contingency.
Just shut up and watch.

06:39.565 --> 06:40.399
Now, then...

06:41.192 --> 06:45.363
who's being made to think
that everything's going as planned?

06:45.446 --> 06:48.491
I wonder which one.

06:49.492 --> 06:51.077
There!

06:52.161 --> 06:52.995
Number nine!

06:53.996 --> 06:57.250
Game number five will be Extreme Old Maid!

06:58.167 --> 07:02.505
This game of Old Maid will be played
with only one joker and two aces.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.216
A test of your acting skills,
tactical skills,

07:05.299 --> 07:08.761
and of course, your luck, as you lure
your opponent towards the Old Maid.

07:08.845 --> 07:10.930
Who will be victorious?

07:12.849 --> 07:16.060
Since I'm the host,
I'll take the joker first.

07:16.686 --> 07:17.937
Here, Yumeko!

07:18.980 --> 07:21.441
I'm going to lose this game on purpose.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.318
That will give Yumeko two match points.

07:24.402 --> 07:28.197
Then I'm going to snatch victory from
the jaws of defeat with two straight wins!

07:28.281 --> 07:30.575
In other words, I'm going to create drama!

07:31.117 --> 07:34.954
In order to hand Yumeko the victory,
I've folded the edge of the joker.

07:35.037 --> 07:40.209
You can't tell if it was intentional.
There's no way that you wouldn't notice.

07:40.793 --> 07:43.212
Draw it! That will give you the win,

07:43.296 --> 07:45.840
and then you'll lose
in mind-blowing fashion!

07:47.633 --> 07:49.802
So, it's just as I expected, then?

07:50.553 --> 07:53.764
She drew an ace on her first try!

07:54.432 --> 07:57.059
Yumeko wins!

07:57.894 --> 08:02.231
- Upper right-hand corner, please.
- Whoa! That's double match point!

08:02.315 --> 08:04.859
All right! That's a big deal!

08:05.818 --> 08:07.153
Yumemi...

08:07.236 --> 08:09.822
No! What am I gonna do?

08:10.656 --> 08:13.034
Who can take their eyes off
these games now?

08:13.117 --> 08:17.663
Yumemi's back is against the wall!
Can she possibly come from behind to win?

08:17.747 --> 08:20.583
Will Yumeko manage to hold on to her lead?

08:20.666 --> 08:24.545
All right,
the fateful game number six will start...

08:25.213 --> 08:27.131
right after these commercials!

08:27.215 --> 08:30.009
"OF COURSE YOU CAN" BATTLE!

08:31.177 --> 08:32.011
All right!

08:32.094 --> 08:36.015
Looks like our two contestants completed
a wardrobe change during the break.

08:36.599 --> 08:39.268
Yumemi. Wow! Now, that's cute!

08:40.102 --> 08:44.023
You guys! Thanks for cheering me on!
I'm gonna do my best, okay?

08:44.607 --> 08:48.277
Next, we have...
Whoa! Now, who would've thought...?

08:49.737 --> 08:53.324
You look cute, but I wish
I could've seen you in costume.

08:53.407 --> 08:56.536
Well, I feel most comfortable
in what I'm accustomed to.

08:57.119 --> 08:58.412
Let's move on!

08:58.496 --> 09:02.124
Yumeko, please roll the dice to determine
what game number six will be.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.042
All right.

09:07.129 --> 09:10.007
And that fateful game is... number five!

09:11.008 --> 09:13.219
It's the "Know Your Fans" game!

09:13.302 --> 09:16.806
You'll choose an audience member
with a roll of the dice

09:16.889 --> 09:19.809
and guess that person's birthday month!

09:19.892 --> 09:23.688
If neither of your answers is correct,
the closest guess wins!

09:23.771 --> 09:26.566
Come on. You can only win by dumb luck.

09:27.149 --> 09:28.651
It's perfect.

09:28.734 --> 09:32.530
I'm going to unload two straight wins.
How do I know?

09:33.155 --> 09:37.034
Because I remember
every single one of my fans' birthdays!

09:37.118 --> 09:40.288
I can't mess this up!
That's why I inflated ticket prices

09:40.371 --> 09:42.999
and made sure only fan club members
could get in.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.961
I know all the student council
members' birthdays, as well.

09:47.545 --> 09:49.964
You're going down, Yumeko Jabami!

09:51.382 --> 09:55.469
Just as I thought, this is the only game
I have a chance of winning.

09:57.513 --> 10:00.391
We have a three in the tens' place!

10:01.559 --> 10:03.978
After seeing how everything transpired,
I'm certain now.

10:04.770 --> 10:08.149
Ordinarily, I wouldn't have a chance
to win any of these contests.

10:08.232 --> 10:12.695
But that's not how it turned out.
In other words...

10:13.487 --> 10:17.366
what you chose instead
was to make this gamble exciting.

10:18.409 --> 10:20.494
No wonder you're a top idol.

10:20.578 --> 10:23.581
Thanks to you,
I now have a shot at winning.

10:24.165 --> 10:27.627
Now, then...
let's get our gambling freak on.

10:30.338 --> 10:35.217
Thirty-one! The person with a 31!

10:36.260 --> 10:38.137
Crap! It's me?

10:41.891 --> 10:42.850
What...?

10:44.143 --> 10:45.019
What...?

10:45.811 --> 10:47.980
Who... Who the hell are you?

10:48.564 --> 10:50.566
Oh, Mary! I totally lucked out!

10:50.650 --> 10:54.320
Don't tell me
this girl can manipulate dice?

10:54.904 --> 10:58.032
Why are there people
not in my fan club here?

10:58.115 --> 10:59.575
By coincidence? By mistake?

11:00.159 --> 11:01.827
But that's not possible.

11:02.370 --> 11:05.915
I'm pretty sure this is exactly
what Yumeko had in mind.

11:06.415 --> 11:10.002
Yumeko saw through my attempts
to fabricate my precarious situation,

11:10.086 --> 11:13.589
rolled the dice,
chose this "Know Your Fans" game,

11:13.672 --> 11:17.051
and picked someone
she knew out of this audience.

11:17.635 --> 11:20.012
How was she able to do that?

11:20.096 --> 11:21.514
There's only one answer.

11:21.597 --> 11:27.186
The moment she read the event proposal,
Yumeko charted her path to victory!

11:29.605 --> 11:33.067
Yumemite, I understand
how you must be feeling.

11:33.859 --> 11:36.612
Suspicion, rage, despair...

11:37.238 --> 11:39.698
You must be ready to scream right now.

11:39.782 --> 11:41.158
I understand completely.

11:41.242 --> 11:46.539
However, let's wait until this contest,
this gamble, is over to let it all out!

11:46.622 --> 11:47.581
All right?

11:49.375 --> 11:54.463
Now, please try to guess the birthday
month of audience member number 31.

11:55.256 --> 11:58.592
How should I know
what that girl's birthday month could be?

11:59.260 --> 12:01.762
Yumemite, you have a frantic look
in your eyes.

12:12.189 --> 12:14.525
Hey, she just wrote six.

12:15.943 --> 12:17.903
The answer is June!

12:21.407 --> 12:22.241
Hold up.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.952
Is she really that stupid?

12:25.411 --> 12:27.872
I can't believe she'd make
that kind of mistake.

12:27.955 --> 12:29.832
She showed me on purpose!

12:29.915 --> 12:31.333
But why?

12:33.586 --> 12:35.421
She could've written nine...

12:36.046 --> 12:40.384
to make sure that I put down six
and avoid playing to a draw!

12:40.468 --> 12:43.179
It's also possible
that that's how she's tricking me.

12:43.262 --> 12:45.222
But if she's taking such a huge gamble

12:45.306 --> 12:47.224
on whether I realize
she's flipped the card...

12:47.308 --> 12:50.478
she'd be better off not giving me
any info from the start!

12:51.187 --> 12:54.857
The answer is September!
No doubt about it!

12:56.609 --> 13:00.988
We have our answers! Are you ready?

13:01.780 --> 13:04.450
This is certainly something
to look forward to, isn't it?

13:05.034 --> 13:09.413
One of these cards
will mark the end of one of our lives.

13:10.539 --> 13:14.460
Oh, please! You're scaring me!
Don't say such ominous things!

13:15.127 --> 13:17.379
All right, you two, together, now!

13:17.463 --> 13:19.924
Show your cards!

13:27.348 --> 13:31.101
June! Did I overanalyze it?

13:31.185 --> 13:35.231
Or did she foresee that I would read
that much into it?

13:35.314 --> 13:38.901
All right, 31, when's your birthday?

13:39.693 --> 13:41.195
It's March 8th.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.115
That means...

13:45.199 --> 13:48.827
that since her guess was closer,
Yumeko wins!

13:49.411 --> 13:52.790
- And of course, you'll be filling in...
- The top square, please.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.084
Three in a row!

13:55.167 --> 13:57.962
Yumeko's win has decided this contest!

14:00.422 --> 14:01.674
All right!

14:02.800 --> 14:04.134
Yumemi...

14:08.973 --> 14:09.807
Why?

14:10.808 --> 14:14.812
I don't know what you're trying to do.
What do you mean, March?

14:15.813 --> 14:18.232
Then why did you put down a six?

14:19.650 --> 14:24.029
If I'd gone with my gut feelings,
you might've lost, you know!

14:24.113 --> 14:28.659
Well, I had no idea
when Mary's birthday was.

14:30.202 --> 14:34.331
My only fear was that you'd put down
the same number as me.

14:35.040 --> 14:39.587
A tie would've been the same as drawing
dead, and that would've been lame.

14:39.670 --> 14:42.423
As long as I can gamble, I'm happy.

14:42.840 --> 14:45.551
I would've been satisfied
with anything but a draw.

14:46.176 --> 14:50.389
Then the reason I lost
was because I was just out of luck?

14:52.683 --> 14:53.976
Just luck.

14:54.059 --> 14:55.728
There's nothing wrong with that!

14:55.811 --> 14:59.815
The absurdity of being helpless
to do anything of your own will.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.943
That right there is the essence
of gambling, after all.

15:03.527 --> 15:08.407
That was an enjoyable gambling session!
Now, then...

15:08.991 --> 15:11.911
how about handing over my winnings?

15:22.546 --> 15:27.176
We'll pay you the 50 million yen.
No, more if that's what you want.

15:27.259 --> 15:31.055
But is there any way to stop you
from disclosing that recording?

15:31.138 --> 15:32.556
If you play it...

15:33.724 --> 15:35.476
Yumemi's future will be over.

15:36.810 --> 15:39.188
Is that how you feel, Yumemite?

15:47.112 --> 15:50.074
- Play the recording.
- Yumemi! What are you saying?

15:51.325 --> 15:55.204
My dream can never be realized
unless I'm also blessed with luck.

15:56.288 --> 16:00.918
If I'm losing at this level,
it's not a dream that will ever come true.

16:02.127 --> 16:03.212
I've...

16:03.295 --> 16:04.964
had enough.

16:08.342 --> 16:09.969
I do like your resolve.

16:11.011 --> 16:13.555
- What's going on?
- What's wrong with Yumemi?

16:13.639 --> 16:14.932
Are they fighting?

16:20.354 --> 16:23.148
Yumemi, you're really sure about this?

16:24.650 --> 16:25.484
Yes.

16:31.073 --> 16:33.409
They're ugly, but that's okay.

16:33.492 --> 16:38.831
That means they're spending money on me
instead of their own looks.

16:39.331 --> 16:43.127
But... why the hell are they dancing
like madmen at my concerts?

16:43.210 --> 16:45.754
If you've got time to dance,
listen to my songs!

16:45.838 --> 16:48.632
Why the hell are you sweating
more than I am?

16:48.716 --> 16:53.095
Stop trying to shake my hand
when yours is sweaty! It's disgusting!

16:55.806 --> 16:59.059
Hey, this voice... is it Yumemi?

16:59.143 --> 17:01.854
She sounds totally different
than she usually does.

17:04.064 --> 17:07.568
Guys, listen to me.
That's the real me you just heard.

17:08.402 --> 17:12.489
What I was really thinking.
This is who I really am.

17:13.323 --> 17:16.035
I'm sorry for deceiving you all this time.

17:16.994 --> 17:17.828
And...

17:19.163 --> 17:23.042
And I want to thank you
for cheering me on till now.

17:28.672 --> 17:29.965
It's all over.

17:30.758 --> 17:35.345
My dreams, my aspirations,
everything I've built up as an idol...

17:35.429 --> 17:36.930
It's all over.

17:38.182 --> 17:40.893
My life had no meaning whatsoever.

17:45.647 --> 17:47.983
Yumemi, we love you!

17:49.151 --> 17:52.571
We don't care
how you feel about us, Yumemi!

17:53.197 --> 17:56.533
We didn't fall in love with you
because you love us back!

17:57.117 --> 18:00.996
We just love you, Yumemi!

18:02.498 --> 18:03.957
That's right!

18:04.041 --> 18:06.418
I wanna contine rooting for you, Yumemi!

18:06.502 --> 18:08.212
I still love you, Yumemi!

18:08.295 --> 18:11.006
It's a relief to hear you speak your mind!

18:11.090 --> 18:13.050
Don't give up, Yumemi!

18:16.470 --> 18:20.349
Encore!

18:30.859 --> 18:31.735
You guys!

18:33.153 --> 18:35.781
You guys, thank you!

18:36.532 --> 18:41.161
As long as you keep cheering me on,
I'll continue being an idol!

18:41.245 --> 18:45.124
Yumemi, we love you!

20:27.392 --> 20:30.979
Hold up a second.
It's like everything got smoothed over.

20:31.563 --> 20:33.357
But this is...

20:33.440 --> 20:34.608
That's right.

20:35.901 --> 20:37.277
It's not over yet.

20:37.819 --> 20:41.990
After all, the culprit who set up Yumemi
still hasn't been convicted.

20:43.033 --> 20:46.912
Today's gamble involved a struggle
over a certain fan letter.

20:49.456 --> 20:54.836
The culprit who sent this discarded letter
to me anonymously is still out there.

20:55.545 --> 21:00.759
Yumemi decided to continue with her career
as an idol, so no harm, no foul.

21:01.385 --> 21:02.427
But one misstep,

21:02.511 --> 21:04.721
and she would've had to retire
immediately.

21:05.305 --> 21:08.934
There's no way I can forgive
the person who set up Yumemi.

21:12.479 --> 21:16.483
She's right! Who put Yumemi
into such a tight spot?

21:16.566 --> 21:17.859
- That's right!
- Show yourself!

21:19.987 --> 21:22.823
Yumemi, can you think of anybody?

21:23.407 --> 21:24.241
No.

21:25.242 --> 21:27.703
Oh, crap,
this thing is starting to escalate.

21:28.370 --> 21:30.289
I have someone in mind!

21:30.372 --> 21:33.083
It's my dream to make
Yumemi's dream come true!

21:33.166 --> 21:38.088
I just can't forgive the culprit
who trampled over our dream!

21:42.592 --> 21:45.053
I've already spilled my guts
about everything,

21:45.137 --> 21:47.139
and my fans have accepted it.

21:47.556 --> 21:51.268
There's absolutely no merit
in revealing the culprit now.

21:52.811 --> 21:56.523
But our dream is our pride.

21:56.606 --> 22:00.652
This is a matter of pride.
I can't rest unless we settle this!

22:04.614 --> 22:08.410
Come to think of it,
I guess I do have someone in mind.

22:08.493 --> 22:13.665
Not that I'm saying it's definitely him...
but I'd like to hear what he has to say.

22:13.749 --> 22:17.252
student council accountant Kaede Manyuda!

22:18.128 --> 22:22.174
That's right! He set up this event
in the first place!

22:22.257 --> 22:25.385
Filling this venue with fan club members
should've ensured our victory!

22:25.469 --> 22:31.016
The only one who could've made it
all fall apart for us is Manyuda!

22:33.435 --> 22:35.562
You're a wanted man, Manyuda!

22:37.022 --> 22:38.815
Manyuda! You...

22:38.899 --> 22:42.527
Just shut up. They won't settle down
unless I go down there.

22:53.455 --> 22:55.791
All right, listen up, everyone.

22:55.874 --> 22:58.710
What they just said
is pure speculation, nothing more.

22:59.544 --> 23:01.838
I have nothing to be ashamed of.

23:02.756 --> 23:05.509
As someone who aspires
to be student council president,

23:05.592 --> 23:07.636
I'll gladly stake my position!

23:09.679 --> 23:10.555
What?

23:16.061 --> 23:19.439
That's quite an interesting statement
to make.

23:20.732 --> 23:23.235
Innocent until proven guilty.
You have no proof.

23:24.528 --> 23:28.740
Oh, that doesn't matter at all.
Proof? This isn't a trial.

23:28.824 --> 23:29.991
Never mind that.

23:30.909 --> 23:33.370
Why don't we settle this by gambling?

23:33.453 --> 23:35.831
We'll each stake our respective claims.

23:35.914 --> 23:38.083
The views of the winner will prevail.

23:38.166 --> 23:40.794
That's how this academy operates.

23:41.378 --> 23:42.963
Now, then, Manyuda...

23:43.839 --> 23:47.384
Declined. You think
a student council member like myself...

23:47.467 --> 23:50.303
would just comply
with these idiotic accusations?

23:50.762 --> 23:52.764
What can you possibly do?

23:52.848 --> 23:55.767
A gamble can only be established
between those of equal standing.

23:56.351 --> 23:58.728
Know your place, you house pet!

24:02.732 --> 24:05.652
If you don't want to do it,
it can't be helped.

24:10.157 --> 24:12.033
MITTENS

24:14.578 --> 24:16.413
Let's have an official match!

24:19.416 --> 24:22.294
- There's no limit to your bet.
- I told you!

24:22.377 --> 24:25.088
- The odds are against Yumeko.
- How did it come to this?

24:25.172 --> 24:29.092
- Showdown!
- Game over. And you're done too.

24:29.176 --> 24:30.969
