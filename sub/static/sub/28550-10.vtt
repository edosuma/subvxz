What do you think

11:22.830 --> 11:24.790
Like, love, or double love?

11:24.790 --> 11:27.120
It's... nice.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.580

11:28.580 --> 11:30.170
What are you thinking, Wasabi?
Hm? Like it?

11:30.170 --> 11:32.000
-Love it? Double love it?
-Look at the time.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.210
Gotta go to class.

11:33.210 --> 11:34.250

11:34.250 --> 11:36.290
Um, why is Baymax buzzing?

11:36.290 --> 11:38.290

11:38.290 --> 11:40.250
-Love of hats.
-(buzzes)

11:40.250 --> 11:42.380
Ha ha! All right!
Thanks, Baymax!

11:42.380 --> 11:44.500

11:45.210 --> 11:47.420
See ya! And nice hat!

11:47.420 --> 11:48.960
(Baymax buzzes)

11:48.960 --> 11:52.000
Yeah, this is good.
This is working.

11:54.040 --> 11:55.750
Fred. No.

11:55.750 --> 11:57.880
Not good?

11:57.880 --> 12:00.040
-Nope. Not good.
-But--

12:00.040 --> 12:02.000
Uh-uh.

People lie frequently.

12:24.250 --> 12:27.120

things work, I guess.

12:29.170 --> 12:32.080
Looks like we're almost
out of time. Any questions?

12:32.080 --> 12:34.960
Will there be a test next week
on the material we just covered?

12:34.960 --> 12:36.120
No.

-Whose phone is that?

12:37.880 --> 12:40.000
It wasn't a phone,
Professor Granville.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.750
-It was Baymax.
-Hello.

12:41.750 --> 12:43.420
-He's got a glitch and--
-Uh-uh.

12:43.420 --> 12:45.210
Save it, Mr. Hamada.

12:45.210 --> 12:47.790
Clearly you've forgotten
my classroom rules.

12:50.750 --> 12:53.790
Sorry, Professor Granville.
It won't happen again.

12:53.790 --> 12:56.170
Good. Any other questions?

12:56.170 --> 12:58.330
Just to follow up
on that test.

12:58.330 --> 13:00.250
I did not say
there would be a test.

13:00.250 --> 13:02.330
Not even a pop quiz?

13:02.330 --> 13:04.790
If there were going to be
a pop quiz,

13:04.790 --> 13:06.460
I would not say so.

13:06.460 --> 13:07.920
That's the pop part.

13:07.920 --> 13:10.380
So there is going
to be a quiz?

a conference call--

13:17.540 --> 13:19.460

13:26.960 --> 13:29.540
I'm so sorry, but Liv has
a very tight schedule today.

13:29.540 --> 13:32.790
But, it will just take a second.
If you just... let me...

13:32.790 --> 13:36.330
Wait! I want to know
if Liv Amara is creating
the monsters!

13:36.330 --> 13:39.830

the monsters.

Do those two things
go together?

15:20.750 --> 15:22.380
And my answer is yes!

15:22.380 --> 15:24.830
The sweetness of
the berries mixes with
the funk of the salami

15:24.830 --> 15:27.210
to create full-bodied
flavor!

15:27.210 --> 15:28.500

16:09.210 --> 16:12.420
Hiro, why did you lie
to Aunt Cass?

16:12.420 --> 16:14.380
Well, I didn't want
to hurt her feelings

16:14.380 --> 16:16.290
by telling her
I didn't like
what she made.

16:16.290 --> 16:18.080
But that is the truth.

16:18.080 --> 16:20.420
Yeah, but saying that
would be mean.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.330
And lying is good?

16:23.330 --> 16:25.620
No, lying is wrong.

16:25.620 --> 16:27.330
In general...

16:28.830 --> 16:31.330
But sometimes,
in certain situations,

16:31.330 --> 16:33.040
people lie so other people
don't get hurt.

16:34.880 --> 16:36.880
It's complicated.

16:38.420 --> 16:40.500
Hiro, you are not eating.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.460
Do you have
gastrointestinal issues?

16:42.460 --> 16:44.000
No, I'm fine.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.790
Aunt Cass just gave me
leftover salami bowl for lunch.

16:46.790 --> 16:49.080
What are you eating?
And why?

16:49.080 --> 16:51.500
-Don't ask.
-How'd it go with Liv?

16:51.500 --> 16:53.960
According to Baymax's
lie detector,

16:53.960 --> 16:56.380
-she isn't the one
making the monsters.
-Really?

16:56.380 --> 16:59.120
Yeah, but it doesn't
make sense.

16:59.120 --> 17:01.290
My gut is telling me
she's behind all this.

17:01.290 --> 17:03.080
There has to be something
I'm missing.

17:03.080 --> 17:05.670
Well, I'm sure you
and your gut

17:08.210 --> 17:09.960

-No.

17:09.960 --> 17:12.960
According to my data,
Go Go has never lied.

17:12.960 --> 17:14.960
It was my phone.

17:14.960 --> 17:17.670
There's a monster robbing
the San Fransokyo Trust.

-Yeah.
