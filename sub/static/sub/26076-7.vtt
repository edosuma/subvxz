03:58.279 --> 03:59.489
Back off, boy.

04:10.541 --> 04:11.501
[grunting]

04:37.235 --> 04:39.612
Yo, we good, man. Okay?

04:42.073 --> 04:43.908
[Davos] I'm not here to do you harm.

04:45.243 --> 04:46.619
I've come to free you.

04:47.412 --> 04:48.913
I'll be parked at the curb.

04:52.875 --> 04:55.586
-[door opens and closes]
-How'd you do that? I spent my whole life
working towards this practice.

04:58.464 --> 05:00.925
Have any of you ever had a goal
so great and true?

05:02.385 --> 05:05.888
I've been eliminating criminals.
You've been scavenging their remains.

05:05.972 --> 05:11.102
Is that how you wish to be seen?
Carrion crows, living meal to meal.

05:12.812 --> 05:14.564
I can show you another way.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.901
I want to offer you all an opportunity.

05:20.653 --> 05:23.406
This city has failed you.

05:24.699 --> 05:25.867
See, I come from a place

05:25.950 --> 05:27.952
where you're considered
the most precious resource.

05:28.036 --> 05:30.955
What, are we gonna go hand out flowers
up at Grand Central?

05:31.039 --> 05:32.165
[chuckles softly]

05:40.882 --> 05:42.300
You live on the fringes.

05:43.426 --> 05:45.887
You catch as catch can.

05:46.846 --> 05:50.516
And what if all that effort it takes
to survive a day, a week, a year

05:50.600 --> 05:53.144
was directed to a noble purpose?

05:54.729 --> 05:56.439
What if I could make you warriors?

05:58.775 --> 06:03.279
I can offer you a place to study,
give you instruction in the martial arts.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.239
You can help me
turn this neighborhood around

06:05.323 --> 06:07.492
and perhaps, one day, this city.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.244
-You for real?
-Oh, I am.

06:10.328 --> 06:12.580
Eden Towers on the waterfront.
Do you know it?

06:13.122 --> 06:15.541
Room and board
for as many who choose to join me.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.710
I will work you hard.

06:18.836 --> 06:20.463
But you'll all be better for it.

06:21.464 --> 06:22.465
Yeah?

06:23.174 --> 06:24.509
Trust me.

06:33.851 --> 06:35.645
That is one strange dude.

06:48.366 --> 06:51.119
Is driving south of 14th Street
your idea of a vacation?

06:51.202 --> 06:53.830
Oh, you know me. I like to stay busy.

06:53.913 --> 06:57.667
Oh, is this about the captain gig
at the two-nine? I'd say it's a good fit.

06:57.750 --> 07:00.294
I wanted to see you
about these Triad murders.

07:01.003 --> 07:04.298
Now, the guy who's responsible for it
is a psychopath, William.

07:05.007 --> 07:07.427
And he's got abilities.

07:09.011 --> 07:11.514
You got the man with bulletproof skin
in your yard.

07:11.597 --> 07:13.099
I got one with a glowing fist.

07:13.182 --> 07:14.725
What do you know about it?

07:14.809 --> 07:16.853
He's been all over Chinatown for months.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.273
He started out taking out petty criminals,
then, a few weeks ago,

07:20.356 --> 07:22.358
he busts up our plan
to take down Yang and Ho.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.235
This is a different guy.

07:24.318 --> 07:26.737
He has a red fist,
the other has a yellow one.

07:26.821 --> 07:31.075
I know it's tough to swallow,
but trust me, there is a real distinction.

07:31.159 --> 07:34.245
-One is trying to do good, and the other--
-Yeah, well, red, yellow,

07:34.328 --> 07:35.746
either way it's a shitstorm.

07:36.205 --> 07:37.957
I got the commissioner
and the community board

07:38.040 --> 07:39.167
breathing down my neck.

07:39.250 --> 07:43.754
Well, give me a couple detectives
and a few unis, I can bring him in.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.340
Thanks. I got it handled.

07:47.884 --> 07:48.718
Listen...

07:48.801 --> 07:50.970
-I've got a couple leads I'm working--
-Misty...

07:51.053 --> 07:52.972
it's not your problem to solve, okay?

07:53.973 --> 07:56.517
I appreciate any information
you wanna share, of course,

07:56.601 --> 07:57.894
but that's where it ends.

07:59.979 --> 08:02.440
You're draggin' your feet on this one,
aren't you?

08:03.191 --> 08:05.818
You're just gonna let the brush fire
burn itself out?

08:05.902 --> 08:08.696
Triad or no, people are dying, Pike.

08:10.114 --> 08:11.491
Go back to Harlem, Misty.

08:12.575 --> 08:14.952
You wanna go toe-to-toe with me
on this kind of call?

08:16.746 --> 08:17.830
Take that job.

08:25.546 --> 08:29.926
As long as Davos is killing Triad,
Pike is okay to look the other way.

08:30.009 --> 08:31.594
-That is unreal.
-Yeah.

08:31.677 --> 08:34.597
I've been at Bayard.
The families of the victims are terrified.

08:34.680 --> 08:37.808
They should be.
He is a wild card with a powerful weapon.

08:37.892 --> 08:39.018
Can you go over Pike's head?

08:39.101 --> 08:43.314
I don't think I should.
I'm a detective on leave in his backyard.

08:43.856 --> 08:44.941
[Colleen sighs]

08:45.024 --> 08:48.319
You going with Danny to PT today?
How's he holdin' up?

08:48.402 --> 08:50.238
Mmm, as best he can.

08:50.321 --> 08:53.282
The doctors can't give us
anything definitive about his recovery.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.867
He's a fighter. He's got it.

08:54.951 --> 08:57.537
The same scientist who built your arm
built his brace.

08:57.620 --> 09:00.790
So it's cutting edge.
Ward's been all over it.

09:01.999 --> 09:05.044
Meachum? He is all right.

09:05.127 --> 09:06.754
-[sighs]
-And, you know...

09:07.296 --> 09:09.382
-I just don't see it.
-Really?

09:09.465 --> 09:10.633
[chuckles]

09:11.634 --> 09:14.679
Honestly, I've been trying
to keep Danny's spirits up, but...

09:15.680 --> 09:17.056
it's not just the leg.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.809
He had Davos. He had Walker--

09:19.892 --> 09:22.979
And then it all went to shit.
Yeah, it's a lot.

09:23.062 --> 09:26.857
Which is why I hope
you are taking time for yourself.

09:27.441 --> 09:32.238
Well, I have been working on the ledger.
I'm trying to crack this damn code.

09:32.321 --> 09:33.531
Thank you, Frank Choi.

09:34.615 --> 09:36.659
Okay, so each page
is a different person, right?

09:36.742 --> 09:38.494
And they're paying in unusual increments.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.747
So it's, like, ten dollars, a hundred...

09:42.498 --> 09:44.584
And what? They were paying off loans?

09:45.251 --> 09:46.335
Life debt.

09:46.919 --> 09:48.087
Passage from China,

09:48.170 --> 09:53.968
forged papers once they got here,
and then rental agreements, furniture...

09:54.051 --> 09:55.803
Sometimes they would pay in money,

09:55.886 --> 09:57.930
but other times
they would pay with possessions.

09:58.014 --> 10:00.725
So I think that that could be that box.

10:01.809 --> 10:04.145
Then that means
someone traded your family heirloom

10:04.228 --> 10:07.315
for passage into this country. Wow.

10:07.398 --> 10:10.109
Maybe. Question is, who?

10:10.610 --> 10:11.444
[door opens]

10:13.738 --> 10:14.655
Hey.

10:16.365 --> 10:17.283
Hey.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.577
Good to see you.

10:19.660 --> 10:21.120
It's good to see you, too.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.790
-What are you doing here?
-And how are you even walking?

10:24.874 --> 10:26.917
[chuckles] Only hurts when I dance.

10:28.210 --> 10:31.714
It's a, uh... It's a Rand tech
compression brace.

10:32.256 --> 10:33.674
It speeds up the process.

10:34.884 --> 10:36.469
The doctors know you're here?

10:38.679 --> 10:42.016
I just wanted to come home.
I couldn't stand the hospital.

10:42.099 --> 10:44.685
[grunts and exhales]

10:46.062 --> 10:47.897
So, what's the latest on Davos?

10:49.523 --> 10:52.526
Uh... Eight more victims. All Triad.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.488
Colleen said you were gonna
speak to the police.

10:55.571 --> 10:57.823
-Get some support.
-Yeah. That's not gonna happen.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.659
Then we do it on our own.

10:59.742 --> 11:00.951
The plan stays the same.

11:01.035 --> 11:04.372
We find a way to get the Fist out of Davos
and then you arrest him.

11:04.455 --> 11:06.749
And the Crane Sisters
will do what they need to.

11:06.832 --> 11:08.000
And what is that, exactly?

11:08.084 --> 11:09.835
[Misty] They weren't certain
on the details.

11:10.419 --> 11:11.796
Except the bowl.

11:11.879 --> 11:13.714
The one they mixed your blood in
with the ashes.

11:13.798 --> 11:14.965
That was crucial.

11:15.049 --> 11:18.552
[Misty] Joy told me
that she got that bowl for Davos.

11:18.636 --> 11:21.514
So we can ask her from where and who...

11:23.140 --> 11:26.477
Ward said he saw Joy and Davos
at an art auction.

11:27.061 --> 11:30.690
Well, then, that's a string we can pull.
I'll look into it, get back to you guys.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.528
It's good to see you back in action.

11:35.611 --> 11:38.489
Back in action? [scoffs]
Are you kidding me?

11:39.407 --> 11:41.826
Look, your leg
is still attached to your body.

11:41.909 --> 11:43.035
[chuckles softly]

11:43.661 --> 11:44.495
[door opens]

11:45.454 --> 11:46.455
[door closes]

11:50.000 --> 11:50.835
[exhales]

11:52.044 --> 11:54.797
No, that's okay. I can handle it.

11:56.298 --> 11:58.008
I wasn't implying you couldn't.

11:59.719 --> 12:00.678
[sighs]

12:01.178 --> 12:02.179
I know. I'm sorry.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.285
If you'd called, I'd have picked you up.

12:25.453 --> 12:28.205
You've already wasted enough time
dealing with all this.

12:28.289 --> 12:31.000
Danny, you would do the same.

12:32.793 --> 12:33.627
[sighs]

12:36.756 --> 12:37.965
This is different.

12:39.425 --> 12:40.718
It wasn't an accident.

12:44.972 --> 12:48.559
I did this to myself,
thinking I could reason with Davos.

12:50.144 --> 12:55.149
And now he's out there with two Fists,
and I'm...

12:56.150 --> 12:56.984
[scoffs]

12:59.487 --> 13:01.155
I mean, what am I supposed to do?

13:01.697 --> 13:03.157
Come with me to Bayard.

13:03.949 --> 13:05.367
The police aren't gonna make a move,

13:05.451 --> 13:08.329
so we need to spread the word
that Davos is out there.

13:09.455 --> 13:12.374
Just because you can't fight,
doesn't mean you can't help.

13:14.543 --> 13:15.544
Yeah.

13:17.463 --> 13:18.547
You're right.

13:24.720 --> 13:25.846
Sofia, I'm sorry.

13:25.930 --> 13:28.182
There's no reason for me
to drive all the way to New Jersey

13:28.265 --> 13:31.268
when you're already there. You're gonna
have to handle this on your own, okay?

13:31.352 --> 13:33.312
-[doorbell rings]
-[intercom system beeping]

13:33.395 --> 13:35.022
I'm gonna have to call you back.

13:41.737 --> 13:43.113
[electricity whirring]

13:54.208 --> 13:56.961
[sighs] What is this?
You finally arrest Davos?

13:57.044 --> 14:00.756
Not yet. He put Danny in the hospital.
Did you know that?

14:00.840 --> 14:02.174
He just got home.

14:03.384 --> 14:04.927
Well, I'll send flowers.

14:06.554 --> 14:08.472
You think this is funny.

14:08.556 --> 14:12.518
Danny is the only reason why you
and your friend Walker aren't behind bars.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.521
If you don't have any information
on the Davos--

14:15.604 --> 14:18.899
Actually, I was hoping that you had some.
Do you mind?

14:19.859 --> 14:20.860
No.

14:21.527 --> 14:24.655
I'm not answering any more questions. This time, there is really just one.

14:28.576 --> 14:32.496
I need to know about the ceremony
you and Davos put him through.

14:32.580 --> 14:33.747
The bowl.

14:33.831 --> 14:36.000
The one that you got
from the auction house.

14:37.626 --> 14:40.170
All I know is that it was crucial,

14:41.380 --> 14:43.215
some kind of Tibetan antiquity.

14:44.133 --> 14:45.426
I need more than that.

14:45.509 --> 14:47.303
I can't tell you what I don't know.

14:49.972 --> 14:53.392
New locks on the door.
That's a fancy intercom system.

14:53.475 --> 14:56.645
-And you got a license for that Taser?
-[chuckles sarcastically]

14:56.729 --> 14:59.440
Of course I do.
These are just precautions.

15:00.816 --> 15:02.693
They gonna stop that Fist of his?

15:03.569 --> 15:08.240
Whatever it is you're holding back,
you need to let me know.

15:13.495 --> 15:16.665
[sighs] The curator who found the bowl
may know more.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.667
Her name is Mika Prada.

15:19.960 --> 15:22.463
Bailey's Auction House. Just...

15:23.422 --> 15:24.256
[sighs]

15:24.340 --> 15:28.469
I may have pressed Mika to get the bowl.

15:29.595 --> 15:30.638
Did you, now?

15:31.180 --> 15:34.016
So she's not a fan?

15:35.059 --> 15:35.976
[Joy] Mmm-mmm.

15:37.478 --> 15:38.812
That's putting it lightly.

15:40.731 --> 15:42.483
Then I like her already.

15:46.862 --> 15:48.030
[inhales deeply]

15:48.113 --> 15:52.409
I thought you were upstairs.
Check that bad boy out.

15:53.410 --> 15:56.205
-Pretty sweet, right?
-[chuckles] It's a great idea.

15:56.288 --> 15:58.582
[Colleen] I was inspired
by that crime scanner thing

15:58.666 --> 16:00.084
you use in the living room.

16:00.167 --> 16:01.961
So it's like the low-tech version.

16:02.044 --> 16:04.004
-[Danny exhales]
-[Colleen chuckles]

16:05.255 --> 16:08.092
Let's, uh... Let's go home.
It's been a long day.

16:08.175 --> 16:09.468
No, it's okay.

16:09.551 --> 16:12.888
Here, let me, um...
Let me give you a hand putting these up.

16:19.103 --> 16:20.312
Okay, wait. Wait.

16:23.565 --> 16:24.650
Danny...

16:26.944 --> 16:29.863
I have been with you in PT
every day, right?

16:30.531 --> 16:32.741
So I see how much you're pushing yourself.

16:33.867 --> 16:35.577
I can tell you're bottling it up.

16:35.661 --> 16:38.163
I'm not the only one suffering
from Davos' actions.

16:38.247 --> 16:41.291
I know,
but you're not responsible for him.

16:41.834 --> 16:42.876
I am.

16:42.960 --> 16:45.838
If he's capable of all this,
then what's my part in it?

16:46.380 --> 16:48.549
We've been tied together
since we were kids.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.843
All of this is happening because of me.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.768
[Colleen] You really scared me, you know.

17:00.477 --> 17:02.688
[Danny] That's the last thing
I wanted to do.

17:05.065 --> 17:06.817
I keep testing this relationship.

17:07.526 --> 17:08.694
Testing us.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.614
It doesn't come
with an instruction manual.

17:15.159 --> 17:18.203
But I've been with you long enough
to know when something's on your mind.

17:19.329 --> 17:21.040
When we were training in K'un-Lun...

17:23.375 --> 17:26.295
there were a thousand days
where I would've given up

17:26.378 --> 17:28.213
if it wasn't for him pushing me.

17:30.632 --> 17:35.012
It wasn't always gently,
but it was always in the right direction.

17:38.515 --> 17:41.643
The idea of the cops hunting him down,
killing him...

17:43.812 --> 17:45.105
it terrifies me.

17:46.356 --> 17:48.192
And even after everything he's done,

17:48.275 --> 17:52.654
I still wanna find a way
to reach out to him, heal him.

17:52.738 --> 17:55.032
You want to see the good in people.

17:56.742 --> 17:59.661
And there is good in Davos. Believe me.

18:03.582 --> 18:05.709
I-- I get it. I do.

18:06.835 --> 18:11.048
What you're feeling isn't any crazier
than the fact that...

18:13.634 --> 18:15.552
I still care about Bakuto.

18:18.639 --> 18:20.390
Even after everything he did to me.

18:21.016 --> 18:25.646
It doesn't change the fact that for years,
he was the one who made me feel safe.

18:26.438 --> 18:31.110
And smart and special.

18:34.196 --> 18:35.572
[Danny sighs]

18:43.539 --> 18:44.581
[cell phone rings]

18:44.665 --> 18:48.502
[Ward] Katie, what part of "I'm at lunch"
can't you grasp?

18:48.585 --> 18:49.962
[toilet flushes]

18:53.173 --> 18:54.967
[slurring] What do you think I'm doing?

18:56.051 --> 18:58.470
Neglecting my duties at Rand, so what?

18:59.304 --> 19:05.644
I can spend the day drinking in some
shitty sports bar in Murray Hill? [laughs]

19:25.330 --> 19:26.582
Ready to close out?

19:28.167 --> 19:29.668
Not even close. What are you doing here, Ward?

19:46.602 --> 19:47.853
How did you find me?

19:48.395 --> 19:51.690
Katie said you stopped in here
for breakfast. Seven hours ago.

19:51.773 --> 19:54.484
I did. I came in for the eggs.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.029
I stayed for the ambiance.

19:57.654 --> 20:02.034
Don't give me that look.
I'm in NA, not AA.

20:02.117 --> 20:04.119
You know that isn't how addiction works.

20:06.788 --> 20:07.998
You need to get to a meeting. Maybe later.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.215
This is about your sister again, isn't it?

20:17.299 --> 20:21.053
Oh, no, that's done.
Joy is officially finished with me.

20:21.136 --> 20:22.221
She said that?

20:23.972 --> 20:27.017
And if that wasn't enough
to earn me a few drinks...

20:28.310 --> 20:30.938
my brother, Danny, almost died.

20:31.480 --> 20:32.981
I know. I was there.

20:35.442 --> 20:39.238
No. No, that was just a scratch.
This time it's his leg.

20:40.906 --> 20:43.158
-Been a banner week.
-I'm sorry.

20:46.119 --> 20:49.331
Why don't you... come to a meeting?

20:50.540 --> 20:52.751
You need to let all this out
in a safe space.

20:52.834 --> 20:55.337
Enough with that sponsor shit.

20:56.296 --> 20:57.839
Today is not about meetings.

20:57.923 --> 21:04.221
Today's about hangin' out in a...
shitty, piss-smelling--

21:04.304 --> 21:06.265
-Hey!
-Hey!

21:09.142 --> 21:11.520
The way I'm tippin'
should buy some respect.

21:11.603 --> 21:13.272
Do you even hear yourself?

21:13.855 --> 21:16.525
Stop deflecting, Ward. Own this.

21:16.608 --> 21:19.695
For Christ's sake.
You get to decide who you wanna be.

21:21.446 --> 21:22.656
So, who do you wanna be?

21:23.740 --> 21:25.033
I don't know.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.412
But whoever that guy is...

21:29.871 --> 21:31.915
let's start with drunk.

21:32.457 --> 21:34.126
[laughs]

21:41.717 --> 21:42.884
What am I doing?

21:43.427 --> 21:44.720
Keeping me company.

21:47.306 --> 21:51.059
Hey, wait, wait, wait. Stay a while.
We'll get you a Shirley Temple.

21:51.143 --> 21:52.728
-No.
-Hey, I'm buying.

21:52.811 --> 21:55.480
Hey, buddy, let the lady go.

21:56.189 --> 21:57.274
Where are you going?

21:57.357 --> 21:59.818
Same place you should go. A meeting.

21:59.901 --> 22:02.654
-Let it be, man.
-Screw you.

22:08.910 --> 22:09.911
[drags stool]

22:11.288 --> 22:12.122
[chuckles]

22:15.584 --> 22:16.668
Come on, man.

22:17.252 --> 22:18.420
You don't want to do that.

22:24.051 --> 22:24.885
[grunts]

22:26.887 --> 22:28.013
You had enough?

22:30.098 --> 22:30.932
[grunts]

22:31.892 --> 22:33.685
[coughing and panting]

22:41.818 --> 22:42.903
How about now?

22:44.780 --> 22:45.614
[Ward] Mmm.

22:45.697 --> 22:46.782
That's a good choice.

22:50.494 --> 22:51.578
[grunting]

22:55.415 --> 22:56.416
[grunts]

23:00.754 --> 23:01.588
[choking]

23:05.926 --> 23:06.927
[breathing heavily]

23:27.614 --> 23:30.575
[Chen] You still want to hit
that Hatchet massage parlor on Chrystie?

23:30.659 --> 23:31.743
Tomorrow.

23:32.702 --> 23:34.913
We need to prepare
for my students' arrival.

23:35.622 --> 23:38.291
-Get supplies for their training.
-Students?

23:39.126 --> 23:41.211
You mean them dead-end kids on the bikes?

23:42.295 --> 23:44.798
Why do you want them street rats
hangin' around, anyway?

23:44.881 --> 23:47.509
Daniel Rand tried to attack me,
and he'll try again.

23:48.343 --> 23:52.055
Anyone who has held the Fist
will stop at nothing to get it back.

23:54.057 --> 23:56.059
You know my talents go beyond driving?

23:56.685 --> 23:58.019
You are one man.

23:59.020 --> 24:00.021
Right.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.066
And those kids are disposable. Not if they rise to the occasion.

24:09.948 --> 24:11.992
It isn't only sentries I need.

24:13.285 --> 24:17.789
This city is large...
and there is a cancer in its flesh.

24:18.832 --> 24:20.333
I can't burn it out alone.

24:21.334 --> 24:22.586
Do you understand?

24:23.420 --> 24:26.006
-[glass shatters]
-[man 1] Hurry up. Let's go. Let's go.

24:26.631 --> 24:28.884
-[man 2 laughs]
-[man 3] Open it up!

24:30.510 --> 24:31.887
[men continue indistinctly]

24:33.472 --> 24:34.723
[man 3] Back seat. Check it out.

24:35.932 --> 24:37.726
Gonna stand there
with your thumb in your ass?

24:37.809 --> 24:40.270
-Come on, help me.
-Hey, check me out.

24:41.229 --> 24:42.814
Take this. Make it quick.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.612
Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What you doin', man?

24:50.530 --> 24:53.283
-Take your pestilence elsewhere.
-Says who?

24:59.581 --> 25:03.001
-Trying to cop a fix, bro.
-You let this poison control you.

25:04.586 --> 25:05.837
Kill you slowly. They're not even Triad!

25:13.386 --> 25:14.888
Do you want to die with them?

25:22.479 --> 25:23.688
[choking]

25:25.774 --> 25:27.984
I'm merely speeding up the process.

25:31.279 --> 25:32.656
-[bones crack]
-[man chokes]

25:41.498 --> 25:43.917
Thank you for taking the time, Ms. Prada.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.294
I knew they'd find the bodies someday.

25:49.047 --> 25:50.549
What can I help you with?

25:50.632 --> 25:53.718
I'm here about a bowl
that you procured for Joy Meachum.

25:56.721 --> 25:59.015
I didn't even read my horoscope today.

26:00.892 --> 26:01.935
Is it bad?

26:04.396 --> 26:07.107
It's very, very bad, isn't it?

26:07.190 --> 26:09.276
What can you tell me about the bowl?

26:09.359 --> 26:12.654
A Tibetan singing bowl
from Ernst Erskine's collection.

26:12.737 --> 26:13.572
[scoffs]

26:14.072 --> 26:17.075
Very rare. Astronomically expensive.

26:17.867 --> 26:20.036
That's what happens
when something's one of a kind.

26:20.120 --> 26:23.248
So if I wanted it, that is the only one.

26:24.082 --> 26:28.712
Okay, I need you to tell me any detail
that you might have on it.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.548
No matter how large or small.

26:35.218 --> 26:37.804
There was a whole section of it
in Professor Erskine's papers.

26:37.887 --> 26:39.681
And a <i>thangka</i> that refers to it.

26:41.433 --> 26:42.434
A what?

26:43.018 --> 26:45.562
A hanging scroll. I can show you.

26:49.190 --> 26:52.402
-All of this was Erskine's?
-He was a major collector.

26:57.574 --> 27:02.829
Erskine's main focus
was rare Asian artifacts from Tibet...

27:03.622 --> 27:04.664
Mongolia.

27:05.457 --> 27:07.667
This is a key piece.

27:08.752 --> 27:12.464
Legend says it's from
an ancient hidden city in the Himalayas.

27:13.632 --> 27:16.176
Let me guess. K'un-Lun.

27:16.259 --> 27:17.427
What's that? [whispers] Never mind.

27:21.139 --> 27:23.683
The city of Shambhala Bhilai.

27:23.767 --> 27:25.894
Mentioned in the <i>Vishnu Purana</i>

27:25.977 --> 27:28.021
and the Zhang Zhung texts
of western Tibet.

27:31.316 --> 27:33.318
Anyway, it's a gorgeous piece.

27:46.039 --> 27:47.248
It's a story.

27:47.791 --> 27:49.376
Too bad the language is dead.

27:50.126 --> 27:55.882
Erskine believed the bowl
to be the key to some ritual or ceremony.

27:57.133 --> 27:59.010
It's all about chi, isn't it?

27:59.969 --> 28:03.139
[Mika sighs] People believe
what they want to believe.

28:04.557 --> 28:06.059
Don't I know it.

28:06.142 --> 28:08.395
Thank you for your time, Ms. Prada.

28:08.478 --> 28:10.772
Not a problem. I hope I was helpful.

28:11.898 --> 28:15.318
And if I was, let dear old Joy know it.

28:22.617 --> 28:23.451
[sighs]

28:24.786 --> 28:26.538
[water running]

28:26.621 --> 28:27.706
What happened?

28:29.416 --> 28:30.834
What happened with the plan?

28:32.043 --> 28:33.044
Sorry.

28:34.462 --> 28:35.839
Do we know each other?

28:36.965 --> 28:37.799
Uh...

28:38.466 --> 28:39.843
I'm Joy Meachum.

28:40.885 --> 28:44.264
I was hoping to talk to Walker.
You must be Mary.

28:45.140 --> 28:47.016
You mind if I come in for a minute?

28:47.100 --> 28:47.934
Uh...

28:48.727 --> 28:51.104
Yeah, sure. Come in.

28:51.187 --> 28:54.858
You know, I was hoping
maybe I could leave Walker a message.

28:54.941 --> 28:58.570
Or maybe you know when she might be back?

28:58.653 --> 29:03.158
Oh. It won't be for a while. Um...
Is it anything I can help you with?

29:04.284 --> 29:07.912
No. No, I don't think so, Mary.
I really need to talk to Walker.

29:07.996 --> 29:12.125
You can't. Sorry.
When she goes away, she is, um...

29:12.208 --> 29:13.042
[clears throat]

29:13.918 --> 29:15.086
...not reachable.

29:16.713 --> 29:18.131
Yeah, look, Mary, um...

29:19.048 --> 29:20.425
This is really important.

29:20.508 --> 29:23.887
This is a life-and-death
kind of a situation, really.

29:25.388 --> 29:28.933
-There is a man named Davos and he's--
-Davos. He hurt my friend Danny.

29:29.017 --> 29:31.186
Danny Rand. Yes. Yes, he did. -You know Danny?
-Yep.

29:33.521 --> 29:37.233
How is he? Last time I saw him,
he was in a very bad way.

29:38.193 --> 29:39.402
Yeah, he's...

29:41.613 --> 29:42.739
I won't keep you.

29:43.531 --> 29:46.242
Oh, no, please. Um, please, don't leave.

29:46.326 --> 29:49.996
To be honest, it's actually just so nice
to have company.

29:50.079 --> 29:54.042
Can I offer you a tea or a coffee,
or a water or anything?

29:54.125 --> 29:54.959
[chuckles]

29:55.502 --> 29:56.795
-Yeah, water.
-Water?

29:56.878 --> 29:58.505
-Yeah.
-Have a seat right here.

29:59.547 --> 30:00.548
Thank you.

30:02.926 --> 30:04.636
So, how do you know Danny, anyway?

30:04.719 --> 30:05.553
[Joy] Uh...

30:07.931 --> 30:09.474
We were close growing up.

30:13.812 --> 30:17.649
Please tell him that I hope
he feels better when you next see him.

30:18.775 --> 30:20.443
I don't think that's gonna be
any time soon.

30:20.527 --> 30:22.654
We had a... [clears throat]
bit of a falling out.

30:22.737 --> 30:27.492
Oh. I'm sorry. You know,
I'm sure you two can work it out.

30:27.575 --> 30:29.369
Danny is such a lovely person.

30:29.452 --> 30:34.207
Just being around him, you can feel
the, like... you know, the good vibes.

30:34.290 --> 30:36.751
I don't think we're gonna be able
to fix this one.

30:37.627 --> 30:39.462
I did something pretty awful to him.

30:40.046 --> 30:42.298
I've only just met you,
but you do not seem like

30:42.382 --> 30:44.050
the kind of person
who would hurt somebody.

30:44.133 --> 30:45.718
At least not consciously.

30:47.178 --> 30:49.639
I guess there's a few sides
to everyone, though, right?

30:52.725 --> 30:57.105
I tried to warn Danny about Walker.
That probably was a bad idea.

30:57.188 --> 30:59.107
I like to think
she didn't mean to hurt him.

30:59.732 --> 31:00.733
That's what I imagine.

31:00.817 --> 31:03.069
She's just a good person in a bad place,
you know?

31:03.152 --> 31:05.071
Trying to get by. Doing a job.

31:07.282 --> 31:09.242
Maybe you're in that same place.

31:09.325 --> 31:10.618
[chuckles softly]

31:11.953 --> 31:13.621
What does she want the money for?

31:14.163 --> 31:16.708
She wants to go away. Away from me.

31:18.001 --> 31:19.836
She doesn't like me much.

31:21.713 --> 31:26.050
If she didn't like you,
why would she work so hard to protect you?

31:26.801 --> 31:28.761
I've seen her risk everything
to keep you safe.

31:32.181 --> 31:34.726
Are you here because
you want Walker to protect you?

31:35.935 --> 31:36.936
I did.

31:37.645 --> 31:38.897
Yeah, but...

31:40.857 --> 31:43.192
I think there's always a way
out of everything.

31:43.818 --> 31:45.987
And I'm the one to find it. [chuckles]

31:46.654 --> 31:49.908
You know, sometimes in life,
all you can do is trust yourself.

31:50.909 --> 31:53.703
I gotta go. But thank you for the water.

32:02.211 --> 32:04.213
-These are really good.
-[chuckles]

32:04.297 --> 32:05.673
That's kind of you to say.

32:06.883 --> 32:11.429
Yeah, I like the shading and this...
this is... this use of negative space.

32:13.348 --> 32:15.934
[both chuckling softly]

32:19.354 --> 32:20.521
Be well, Mary.

32:28.071 --> 32:29.072
[thunder rumbling]

32:34.869 --> 32:36.871
[men shouting in Slavic language] -[man 1 screaming]
-[man 2] Hey! Hey!

32:45.338 --> 32:47.674
[man 2 in English] You're number one
on this whole situation.

32:47.757 --> 32:49.092
You don't have to do this.

32:50.009 --> 32:52.178
[men continue shouting in Slavic language]

32:52.887 --> 32:53.888
[rapid gunfire]

33:00.687 --> 33:02.689
[rain falling]

33:09.612 --> 33:10.780
[thunder rumbling]

33:31.300 --> 33:33.344
[thunderstorm continues]

33:49.277 --> 33:50.111
[exhales] [water stops]

34:19.307 --> 34:20.558
[exhales]

34:20.641 --> 34:22.018
[knocking at door]

34:23.061 --> 34:25.396
-Hello.
-Hey.

34:26.397 --> 34:28.107
-Right on time.
-Hey.

34:28.191 --> 34:29.400
Got room for one more?

34:29.484 --> 34:31.986
-This is vegan.
-Of course it is.

34:32.612 --> 34:33.821
[Danny] How'd it go with Joy?

34:33.905 --> 34:37.575
[Misty] Joy sent me to the auction house
where she got the bowl.

34:37.658 --> 34:42.246
Verified that it is vital to the ceremony
and one of a kind.

34:43.206 --> 34:45.249
[Colleen] Great.
So we're back where we started.

34:45.333 --> 34:50.880
Not necessarily. I think I found
some kind of instruction manual.

34:53.257 --> 34:54.550
[Danny] It's a <i>thangka.</i>

34:54.634 --> 34:56.594
[Misty] And the images on it,
they tell a story.

34:56.677 --> 34:59.097
Depict some kind of transfer of chi.

34:59.180 --> 35:00.223
[Colleen] How can you tell?

35:00.306 --> 35:02.391
It's just like looking at a crime scene.

35:02.475 --> 35:06.562
The objects, how and where they lay,
they just kind of speak to me.

35:06.646 --> 35:08.940
This text here, it's ancient Tibetan.

35:09.482 --> 35:10.566
Can you read it?

35:12.360 --> 35:16.030
"The way of uniting souls
through the coil of a serpent."

35:16.114 --> 35:17.156
[Misty] Come again?

35:17.240 --> 35:19.117
It's the precise measurements needed.

35:19.200 --> 35:22.036
And a specific hand placement
to complete the transfer.

35:22.829 --> 35:24.705
Well, that's great, right?

35:25.790 --> 35:30.211
I'm guessing that this isn't metaphorical.

35:30.795 --> 35:33.673
No. It's a warning.

35:35.299 --> 35:36.300
Here.

35:37.927 --> 35:41.097
"The transfer is a powerful
and complex process,

35:41.180 --> 35:43.516
just like the spirit of the dragon itself.

35:43.599 --> 35:47.520
If mishandled, it could mean death
for all parties involved."

35:48.646 --> 35:49.981
More good news.

35:50.064 --> 35:52.775
[Misty] You know, when I got the call
about Donnie Chang...

35:52.859 --> 35:54.944
[chuckles] I never thought
I'd be a part of...

35:55.903 --> 36:00.658
taking the dragon out of one guy
and putting it back into another.

36:00.741 --> 36:02.243
It's the spirit of the dragon.

36:02.326 --> 36:04.954
[snickers] 'Cause that makes it better?

36:05.037 --> 36:06.914
Hey, this is still something
that we can use.

36:08.583 --> 36:12.879
Chi and dragons. It's crazy.

36:12.962 --> 36:18.301
But it is powerful to know
that what I can do applies to all of this.

36:19.594 --> 36:21.888
And with that, we're gonna need a hand

36:21.971 --> 36:24.807
if we wanna take on Davos
and get back that bowl.

36:25.391 --> 36:27.143
I thought you said
the police were a no-go.

36:27.226 --> 36:30.521
Pike won't do the right thing,
so I need to find someone who will.

36:30.605 --> 36:33.816
-You know, bang down doors.
-Call us if you need us.

36:33.900 --> 36:37.695
Absolutely. As soon
as I know something, you will too.

36:39.739 --> 36:40.573
[door closes]

36:41.574 --> 36:43.910
-So we need the bowl?
-That's not all we need.

36:44.452 --> 36:47.288
I have to be ready to face Davos
and take back the power.

36:49.624 --> 36:50.958
I can't do that alone.

36:52.543 --> 36:56.505
I have to find a way to fight
and get around this injury, you know?

36:58.007 --> 36:59.926
A physical therapist isn't gonna help.

37:04.305 --> 37:05.806
You want me to train you?

37:07.808 --> 37:10.686
Look, I-- I know it's asking a lot.

37:10.770 --> 37:12.980
It's not a lot. It's everything.

37:14.649 --> 37:15.483
[scoffs]

37:16.776 --> 37:20.238
I made a decision to stop teaching.
I can't just walk that back.

37:22.573 --> 37:24.325
You're a great teacher, Colleen.

37:25.868 --> 37:28.788
Finding out about the Hand,
it messed you up. I get it.

37:29.372 --> 37:31.707
But I need that side of you,
even if it hurts.

37:33.084 --> 37:36.837
You're the only person I can trust,
the only person who understands me.

37:39.048 --> 37:41.717
This may be something you need,
but it's not something I can give.

37:48.933 --> 37:49.976
Okay.

37:53.896 --> 37:57.149
-[Colleen] What are you doing?
-[grunts] Making space.

37:58.901 --> 38:02.613
If you can't train me, I'll train myself.

38:02.697 --> 38:05.324
-Danny, come on.
-Davos needs to be stopped.

38:05.408 --> 38:08.953
Are you sure that's what this is?
Or is this about the Fist?

38:10.830 --> 38:13.833
I can tell you want it back,
you need it back.

38:15.084 --> 38:16.836
You can't help yourself.

38:16.919 --> 38:21.007
If the idea of teaching overwhelms you,
Colleen, it's fine. I get it.

38:21.090 --> 38:23.342
-It's scary.
-I'm not afraid.

38:23.426 --> 38:25.720
Then why did you close this place down?

38:25.803 --> 38:28.055
Screw you, Danny. Screw you!

38:28.139 --> 38:30.266
You don't get to
make the decision on your own

38:30.349 --> 38:32.184
to turn this place into a dojo again.

38:33.185 --> 38:35.313
It's my place just as much as it is yours.

38:35.396 --> 38:37.815
-It's ours.
-Well, act that way.

38:45.197 --> 38:48.159
I've been sober for six years,
nine months and 23 days.

38:48.909 --> 38:51.162
But tonight, I really wanted to use.

38:51.996 --> 38:56.667
Snort some Oxy, add a Seconal chaser.
Anything to take me away from today.

38:58.919 --> 39:01.172
[clears throat] I don't even know
when it started.

39:01.964 --> 39:03.174
No, that's...

39:04.467 --> 39:05.676
That's not true.

39:07.053 --> 39:08.512
It started that first time.

39:10.598 --> 39:13.768
It was sudden. Neither of us expected it.

39:14.935 --> 39:19.982
One minute we were chatting about nothing,
and then the next, we were together.

39:21.192 --> 39:23.819
And again the next night, and again.

39:25.196 --> 39:26.238
I liked it.

39:27.406 --> 39:28.866
I liked him.

39:29.825 --> 39:31.369
So I crossed lines.

39:32.703 --> 39:34.246
I walked into a bar today.

39:35.164 --> 39:36.165
I...

39:38.209 --> 39:40.044
wanted to help him.

39:40.753 --> 39:42.338
I thought I could handle him.

39:44.090 --> 39:45.716
That he'd be different with me.

39:47.635 --> 39:49.095
I lied to myself.

39:49.845 --> 39:54.183
Which wouldn't be so bad
if he hadn't gotten me pregnant.

39:56.811 --> 40:00.147
I've been with child, his child,

40:00.689 --> 40:06.362
for six weeks, three days and 14 hours.

40:09.490 --> 40:12.243
I'm barely keeping my head above water,
but a baby...

40:15.704 --> 40:18.040
And its father is an addict just like me.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.171
What am I supposed to do with that?

40:31.137 --> 40:32.138
Hi.

40:33.681 --> 40:34.974
It's me.

40:37.268 --> 40:40.813
Now, I know that you must be pretty angry,
all that missed time.

40:40.896 --> 40:44.567
It's no accident. I've been doing
everything I can to keep you away.

40:45.860 --> 40:50.114
Pills to keep me calm,
an open faucet to mimic rain.

40:55.202 --> 40:56.996
I think I'm changing.

40:58.664 --> 41:00.875
Which means you must be, too.

41:02.710 --> 41:07.131
I've heard about what you're planning
to do with our future, Walker, and...

41:07.923 --> 41:10.843
I had to say something.
So I hope you hear me.

41:13.220 --> 41:14.472
Hear this.

41:18.017 --> 41:20.102
Your friend Joy came round...

41:20.769 --> 41:23.355
and she said
she wanted you to protect her.

41:25.941 --> 41:29.653
Which made me remember
all the times that you have protected me.

41:32.156 --> 41:33.657
Back in Green Bay.

41:37.161 --> 41:38.496
In Sokovia.

41:41.415 --> 41:44.376
You got us out of that hole,
so thank you for that.

41:47.004 --> 41:48.005
I, uh...

41:52.134 --> 41:54.845
I do not wanna keep trading
one dark place for another.

41:56.639 --> 41:59.892
What if we can get help?
Isn't it worth trying?

42:01.268 --> 42:05.147
I, uh... I know that you're
the strong one, so I surrender.

42:05.856 --> 42:08.025
I trust you. [softly] Shit.

42:08.108 --> 42:09.527
[heart thumping]

42:12.530 --> 42:14.990
If, when I wake up...

42:16.158 --> 42:19.495
I'm in Arizona, then so be it.

42:22.623 --> 42:25.459
But I hope that you choose another way.

43:09.461 --> 43:12.715
[Joy] Somehow, this is exactly
how I pictured you'd be living.

43:18.012 --> 43:20.264
The bare essentials are all that's needed.

43:20.347 --> 43:21.432
[Joy] Yeah...

43:22.474 --> 43:24.184
That's never been my life.

43:25.311 --> 43:28.522
But that's kind of what I'm here for.

43:29.773 --> 43:31.859
I have to say, I'm surprised to see you.

43:32.568 --> 43:35.779
Our last conversation was disappointing.

43:37.239 --> 43:39.074
Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about it.

43:39.617 --> 43:43.287
I told you how I was moving forward.
I was moving on.

43:43.370 --> 43:45.289
I've got these plans. A solar cell patent.

43:45.372 --> 43:46.498
I remember.

43:46.582 --> 43:48.709
People in rooms talking about numbers.

43:48.792 --> 43:51.295
People on screens
talking about other screens.

43:51.378 --> 43:54.256
Empty promises. False friendships.

43:55.924 --> 43:57.092
None of it's real.

43:59.970 --> 44:01.722
But what we did to Danny...

44:04.141 --> 44:05.684
That meant something.

44:06.560 --> 44:07.645
Yes, it did.

44:08.854 --> 44:10.648
Changed the locks on my door.

44:12.107 --> 44:13.484
Hell, I got a new door.

44:15.736 --> 44:16.987
Because I was afraid.

44:17.613 --> 44:18.614
Of me?

44:20.240 --> 44:21.450
Joy...

44:24.870 --> 44:26.246
I don't wanna hurt you.

44:28.415 --> 44:31.293
I told you the potential
I've always seen in you.

44:34.380 --> 44:38.008
I think I was more afraid of letting go

44:38.717 --> 44:39.968
than I was of you.

44:42.054 --> 44:46.100
Fate brought us together for a reason.
I can't keep ignoring that.

44:48.352 --> 44:51.980
I told you I was done
and that what we did to Danny was enough.

44:53.107 --> 44:54.358
Maybe it wasn't.

44:56.860 --> 44:58.487
I heard what you did to his leg.

44:59.029 --> 45:00.614
He gave me no choice.

45:03.450 --> 45:07.746
What I'm planning, Joy,
goes so far beyond revenge.

45:09.206 --> 45:12.084
It's about building a future
we could be proud of.

45:15.421 --> 45:18.465
But you had to start with yourself first.

45:19.508 --> 45:21.719
Become the person you wanted to be.

45:22.261 --> 45:26.890
So if I want to make the world better,
I have to be better.

45:27.433 --> 45:29.643
I'm so glad to hear you say this.

45:33.355 --> 45:34.815
Joy, I miss your company.

45:36.275 --> 45:37.359
Really?

45:38.861 --> 45:40.070
I can be so trying.

45:40.154 --> 45:43.407
I see it more as a counterpoint. I can...

45:44.825 --> 45:46.034
I can be serious.

45:47.119 --> 45:48.954
And a master of understatement.

45:52.374 --> 45:54.042
You have nothing to fear, Joy.

45:55.544 --> 45:56.545
Okay?

45:57.629 --> 46:00.758
I am your protector and your friend.

46:06.805 --> 46:07.973
Let me show you around.

46:12.895 --> 46:16.148
Not to bring up a sore subject,
but you know Mika Prada?

46:17.441 --> 46:20.652
A shameful moment,
but it was a necessary sacrifice.

46:20.736 --> 46:23.363
What did you do with the bowl
that we got from her?

46:27.534 --> 46:28.744
It's worth a lot of money.

46:29.953 --> 46:34.374
I'm thinking if I sell it back
to the auction house at a discount,

46:34.917 --> 46:36.460
I can fix a broken friendship.

46:37.878 --> 46:41.256
I need to keep it close, Joy.
It's crucial in the transference.

46:45.135 --> 46:46.136
I understand.

46:46.678 --> 46:47.888
I'm so glad you're here.

46:50.682 --> 46:51.517
Wow.

46:52.976 --> 46:57.648
This is an auspicious arrival.
Come in. Be welcome.

46:57.731 --> 46:59.316
Will you just give me a moment?

47:00.234 --> 47:03.195
Hey, how you do that thing with your fist?

47:04.112 --> 47:06.615
That is not something
I can explain to you quickly.

47:08.242 --> 47:12.663
It's part of a larger discipline
to hone your body and your mind.

47:14.373 --> 47:17.251
My focus is not on destruction...

47:18.710 --> 47:20.128
but on bringing change.

47:21.922 --> 47:23.715
Yeah, we'll give it a minute.

47:24.341 --> 47:27.219
Well, make yourself comfortable. Come on.

47:36.103 --> 47:37.563
What's your name, man?

47:37.646 --> 47:39.648
I am the Immortal Iron Fist.

47:42.067 --> 47:44.152
But if we are to embark
on this journey together,

47:44.236 --> 47:45.821
you shall call me Shifu.

47:45.904 --> 47:47.072
Shifu?

47:47.155 --> 47:49.074
Yes, Shifu.

47:57.082 --> 47:59.585
Yes, Shifu.

48:12.139 --> 48:13.140
[grunts]

48:22.858 --> 48:23.942
[inhales deeply]

48:26.778 --> 48:28.947
[exhales slowly]

48:35.203 --> 48:37.998
-[Danny grunting and panting]
-[rapid strikes landing]

49:12.950 --> 49:14.034
[shouts]

49:14.117 --> 49:15.035
[groans]

49:18.580 --> 49:20.248
[door slides open]

49:21.416 --> 49:23.543
-[sighs]
-[Colleen] Not your best idea.

49:31.635 --> 49:32.761
I'm sorry.

49:32.844 --> 49:34.262
Don't apologize.

49:36.848 --> 49:39.393
And I didn't close the dojo
because I was afraid.

49:41.019 --> 49:41.937
I closed the dojo

49:42.020 --> 49:45.065
because I couldn't be a part
of sending anyone else to their grave.

49:46.316 --> 49:47.693
I'm not gonna die.

49:47.776 --> 49:48.902
You don't know that.

49:52.030 --> 49:55.867
You and Davos trained together,
but you never taught anyone.

49:57.244 --> 49:58.829
You don't know what that means.

50:01.289 --> 50:02.624
When I teach someone...

50:03.875 --> 50:07.587
what they do...
what comes from that, is on me.

50:11.133 --> 50:13.427
If I do this,
everything changes between us.

50:15.637 --> 50:21.143
I'll have to separate myself,
emotionally, from this.

50:22.853 --> 50:23.937
From you.

50:25.647 --> 50:26.481
[sighs]

50:30.068 --> 50:31.570
I have no other choice.

50:33.697 --> 50:34.823
Yes, you do.

50:36.366 --> 50:37.617
You've made yours. I've made mine.

50:41.705 --> 50:44.374
[groans]
Can you give me a warning next time?

50:45.959 --> 50:47.711
"May I have a warning, sensei?"

50:48.587 --> 50:50.839
No, you may not.

50:51.423 --> 50:52.466
Get up.

51:07.022 --> 51:08.815
Ah! [grunts]

51:11.193 --> 51:12.194
Again.

51:25.457 --> 51:26.708
Again.

51:29.294 --> 51:31.797
Yes, sensei.

51:40.347 --> 51:41.640
Better. Ah! [groans]

51:44.976 --> 51:46.019
Come on!

51:51.566 --> 51:52.400
[yells]
