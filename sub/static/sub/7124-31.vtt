01:46.496 --> 01:52.640
Hey where am I in the way this is the kingdom of huge of course

01:52.896 --> 01:58.272
That crack in my ceiling

01:59.552 --> 02:02.880
Well my friend of top is probably pretty worried about me so I best get going

02:03.136 --> 02:05.184
Give me a boost back up to that Cracker whatever

02:11.840 --> 02:12.864
Are you right now

02:13.120 --> 02:16.448
You should wait for him here or you could miss each other

02:16.960 --> 02:19.264
I guess that does make sense

02:20.800 --> 02:24.384
Besides you're just in time to witness the Chinese

02:24.640 --> 02:26.432
Pokemon wonders

02:26.688 --> 02:30.272
Timing pin million hours time

02:31.552 --> 02:32.320
Remember

02:34.368 --> 02:38.976
Guess what the kind

02:39.232 --> 02:43.584
We will away from talk Charming in style and comfort

02:44.096 --> 02:47.424
Child is always more to come

02:49.472 --> 02:50.240
Apple scruffs

03:08.160 --> 03:09.696
Good good good good good

03:10.464 --> 03:11.232
How you feeling

03:13.280 --> 03:14.560
Takes a little

03:14.816 --> 03:15.584
What happened

03:16.608 --> 03:19.424
Well he was playing some freestyling that wow

03:19.680 --> 03:20.960
If you fell down the hole

03:21.216 --> 03:22.752
The bounce off parachute number 2

03:23.008 --> 03:24.288
And landed on 301

03:25.568 --> 03:26.336
Parachute

03:27.872 --> 03:28.640
Walnut

03:30.176 --> 03:31.456
All right now

03:31.712 --> 03:34.784
Thanks for helping me but I got to go

03:35.040 --> 03:35.808
What's your hurry

03:36.320 --> 03:37.344
What Prince the laptop

03:37.600 --> 03:38.624
You could be looking for me

03:39.136 --> 03:39.648
War

03:39.904 --> 03:43.232
Could be in trouble every second I'm down here I'm falling further away

03:43.744 --> 03:44.768
Like I get back

03:45.024 --> 03:47.072
I think that's a pretty bad idea

03:47.584 --> 03:49.888
You were unconscious while you were falling remember

03:50.144 --> 03:52.960
So you might have been falling for weeks or even months

03:53.472 --> 03:54.752
Trust me it's possible

03:55.008 --> 03:56.288
This is a very deep hole

03:56.800 --> 03:59.360
If you try to climb out you could run out of food

04:01.664 --> 04:04.224
I feel like you should probably not starve to death

04:04.480 --> 04:07.552
When your friend comes looking you're still alive

04:09.088 --> 04:10.112
You know I think you're right

04:10.368 --> 04:12.416
10 is a pretty early kid I got to admit

04:12.672 --> 04:14.208
Probably be here in half a gift

04:14.464 --> 04:15.488
Oh good good

04:16.255 --> 04:18.559
Motel Van please make yourself at home

04:19.071 --> 04:20.351
Eva Wong

04:20.863 --> 04:21.630
Thanks man

04:21.887 --> 04:22.911
I'm Jake by the way

04:23.167 --> 04:25.215
Hi Jake

04:25.471 --> 04:27.519
Strange name I know but I'm pretty sure

04:27.775 --> 04:31.359
See I carved it in the floor when I first got down here so I wouldn't forget

04:33.407 --> 04:34.943
But you can call me 7 for sure

04:53.375 --> 04:58.239
Damn you so much

04:58.495 --> 04:59.519
I was actually pretty cool

04:59.775 --> 05:00.287
But

05:00.543 --> 05:01.567
I should probably get going

05:03.103 --> 05:07.967
Can you leave now

05:08.735 --> 05:10.271
I feel like Jake should have been here by now

05:10.527 --> 05:15.391
What if he's lost or hurt but this is not the huge Kingdom way

05:15.903 --> 05:17.951
Sorry man I Got My Mind Made Up

05:26.399 --> 05:27.935
If you just stay put

05:28.191 --> 05:32.799
Oh you need will come to you in time I get a saint to me

05:33.055 --> 05:34.847
Bought you message

05:35.103 --> 05:37.151
You must wait

05:37.407 --> 05:43.551
Anti him up with normal spaghetti and bring him food yes

05:53.791 --> 05:56.095
It started out as a day like any other

05:56.607 --> 06:02.751
I was a door-to-door sales bear specializing in candles and playing cards making my way to the Candy Kingdom like

06:03.007 --> 06:05.055
Titan 200 times before

06:05.311 --> 06:10.687
I guess my horse got stung by a bee or something cuz all of a sudden he just brought them at out we went off road

06:10.943 --> 06:13.503
I got thrown back into my wag

06:14.271 --> 06:15.295
When the shaking stops

06:15.551 --> 06:16.319
I crawled out

06:16.575 --> 06:17.343
Only to find out

06:17.599 --> 06:19.903
Wedge deep in a hole in it sinking fast

06:20.415 --> 06:22.975
I had just enough time to rig up a parachute

06:25.023 --> 06:26.303
And I've been falling ever since

06:27.327 --> 06:28.351
Sometimes walnuts

06:28.607 --> 06:29.631
Fall into the hole

06:30.143 --> 06:31.167
Sometimes rain

06:32.703 --> 06:33.983
And I guess that was enough

06:35.263 --> 06:36.799
So how did you pass the time

06:37.311 --> 06:43.455
Well for a long time I just waited to be rescued 599 Mississippi 3600 Mississippi

06:43.711 --> 06:48.319
But that was crazy boring so then I got really into FreeCell and things got a lot better

06:48.831 --> 06:49.343
Freecell

06:49.599 --> 06:51.647
Yeah it's like solitaire but there's a

06:51.903 --> 06:53.695
Very few unsolvable Shuffle

06:55.231 --> 06:56.511
It's a great game

06:56.767 --> 06:58.047
Great game I really love

06:59.839 --> 07:01.119
But it's nice you know

07:01.887 --> 07:04.959
To have someone I can play FreeCell alongside of

07:05.471 --> 07:06.239
Yeah man

07:06.495 --> 07:07.775
You know also

07:08.031 --> 07:10.079
I know some other card games we can play

07:10.335 --> 07:10.847
You know

07:11.103 --> 07:11.871
Together

07:14.431 --> 07:16.479
I forgot the word games like that

07:27.999 --> 07:32.095
Charmed

07:32.351 --> 07:36.703
One of the boys had simply gotten

07:36.959 --> 07:39.519
Words under friends

07:39.775 --> 07:41.055
Are you listening

07:49.759 --> 07:51.807
Alright buddy let's run through this again

07:52.319 --> 07:53.599
We're only going to get one shot

07:54.111 --> 07:57.183
When the clock strikes 12

07:57.695 --> 07:59.231
You guys like clean jokes

07:59.999 --> 08:02.047
Then Chuck some delicious food in their mouth

08:03.071 --> 08:07.679
Having never before no generosity so immediately make me their leader and undo my spaghetti

08:07.935 --> 08:09.215
Then

08:09.471 --> 08:11.007
With a perfectly time serving tray

08:11.263 --> 08:13.311
I'll deflect the Hunter Box brass Arrow

08:13.823 --> 08:14.847
Swift

08:15.103 --> 08:18.431
The are looking happy in the chandelier bat steals asparagus

08:18.687 --> 08:19.455
Meanwhile

08:19.711 --> 08:21.759
Phase 2

08:22.015 --> 08:26.623
Sending can mangosteen careening into the clean silverware

08:27.903 --> 08:28.415
But also

08:28.671 --> 08:34.047
Asparagus Arrow has caught the Domino thing of food at home and huge lemon

08:36.351 --> 08:40.191
It's not a perfect plan but with a little luck and then it's got a good chance

08:43.775 --> 08:45.311
Hey you guys like clean jokes

09:01.951 --> 09:04.511
There's nowhere to run

09:05.023 --> 09:10.143
You know you'll never Escape I'm not trying to escape anymore

09:10.655 --> 09:13.215
I'm going to murder your stupid cop you psycho

10:07.999 --> 10:08.511
Figures

10:08.767 --> 10:10.303
Figure interest

10:11.327 --> 10:12.863
Time forgotten like

10:13.119 --> 10:15.423
Stars in a savings card to buy

10:15.679 --> 10:16.703
Warm Skies

10:16.959 --> 10:17.983
To the hot house

10:18.751 --> 10:20.799
Take your socks off

10:28.991 --> 10:29.503
Jake

10:32.063 --> 10:36.159
Winifred

10:36.415 --> 10:42.559
