00:09.735 --> 00:13.011
(Man) Good evening.
Good evening, good evening.

00:13.135 --> 00:14.693
Hello, chaps.

00:14.815 --> 00:16.612
(Orchestra tuning up)

00:17.855 --> 00:19.732
Thank you for coming.

00:20.935 --> 00:25.531
Now then, we have a long way to go,
so... er... keep your powder dry.

00:25.655 --> 00:26.929
(Chuckling)

00:27.055 --> 00:30.007
Righty-ho...
settle down, now.

00:30.095 --> 00:31.608
(Taps baton)

00:34.335 --> 00:36.769
1... 2... 3...

00:36.895 --> 00:44.324
(Woman) # I'm mad about the boy

00:45.455 --> 00:51.132
# I know it's stupid to be
mad about the boy

00:52.775 --> 00:57.087
# I'm so ashamed of it,
but must admit

00:57.215 --> 01:03.893
# The sleepless nights
I've had about the boy

01:06.935 --> 01:10.564
# On the silver screen

01:10.695 --> 01:16.486
# He melts my foolish heart
in every single scene

01:18.535 --> 01:21.208
# Although I'm quite aware

01:21.335 --> 01:29.367
# That here and there are traces...
of the cad about the boy

01:32.735 --> 01:37.445
# And Lord knows, I'm not a fool girl

01:39.335 --> 01:43.965
# I really shouldn't care

01:45.975 --> 01:49.604
# Lord knows, I'm not a schoolgirl

01:49.735 --> 01:56.493
# In the flurry of her first affair

01:58.095 --> 02:07.128
# Will it ever cloy, this odd diversity
of misery and joy?

02:08.935 --> 02:13.611
# I'm feeling quite insane
and young again

02:13.735 --> 02:20.732
# And all because I'm mad
about the boy

# I'm feeling quite insane
and young again

02:39.335 --> 02:44.045
# And all because I'm...

02:45.295 --> 02:50.927
#... mad about the boy #

02:58.415 --> 03:00.326
(Thunderclap)

03:06.055 --> 03:09.491
(Girl) She's the first lady racer.
- But she didn't actually win.

03:09.615 --> 03:13.813
She crossed the line first.
It's so exciting.

03:13.935 --> 03:16.210
Not nearly as exciting
as crossing your mother.

03:16.335 --> 03:18.724
I think we can all ignore that.

03:18.855 --> 03:21.767
Oh, what is that man doing?

03:25.975 --> 03:27.249
Jackson!

03:27.375 --> 03:29.445
Madam?
- What did I tell you?

03:29.575 --> 03:33.614
Put the camellias by the front door
before the guests arrive!

03:33.735 --> 03:35.134
Furber.
- Madam?

03:35.255 --> 03:38.770
Salvage any of Jackson's appalling
pruning and send it to Mrs Holborough

03:38.895 --> 03:43.571
who's kindly offered up a leg of mutton
for dinner, which you'll fetch, Marion.

03:43.695 --> 03:46.573
But Reverend Burton has asked me
to drain the font.

03:46.695 --> 03:49.846
My hands are clearly full.
- I'll go.

03:49.975 --> 03:53.126
Uncle George has posted
the most grizzly clippings

03:53.255 --> 03:54.893
of the Valentine's Day Massacre!

03:55.015 --> 03:56.209
Hilda.

03:56.335 --> 04:00.726
Seven terrified men cut down
in a hail of automatic gun fire!

04:00.855 --> 04:04.928
Made worse by the strays that
came to lap the curdled blood.

04:05.055 --> 04:08.365
Hilda...
- The Devil Dogs! The Hounds of Hell!

04:08.495 --> 04:11.134
The leg of lamb! Now.

04:15.335 --> 04:20.488
Why we try and marry her off to gentry
when plainly she'd prefer an undertaker.

04:20.615 --> 04:24.449
Seating. I'm putting Sarah on your left
and Philip on your right,

04:24.575 --> 04:27.135
so please try and make an effort
to be civil.

04:27.255 --> 04:31.692
Right... I shall go and brush up
on my very small talk.

04:32.935 --> 04:35.085
(Marion) It might be an awkward meal.

04:35.215 --> 04:38.844
For all we know Sarah's grazing
in greener pastures.

04:38.975 --> 04:43.810
Whilst your brother sows his wild oats
in the South of France with his floozy?

04:43.935 --> 04:48.884
No. We'll keep the home fires burning
until his highness wanders home.

04:49.015 --> 04:50.733
Hmm. Like father did?

04:50.855 --> 04:53.323
Yes. Like your father did.

04:57.815 --> 04:59.806
(Grunting)

05:03.255 --> 05:05.371
(Hilda) I've got news, everybody!

05:06.215 --> 05:09.446
You all right, sir?
- No. Are you?

05:09.575 --> 05:12.248
Coping, sir.
- Hear, hear. Well done.

05:12.375 --> 05:15.208
Well done? They look like
they're waiting for a firing squad.

05:15.335 --> 05:19.533
Can't you make them more relaxed?
- Last meal and a cigarette, perhaps?

05:19.655 --> 05:23.694
I can't believe it. You'll never guess.

05:23.815 --> 05:27.524
Houdini escaped the Chinese water
torture only to die of a burst appendix.

05:27.655 --> 05:30.852
How ghastly!
Oh, and Mother's got a telegram.

05:32.135 --> 05:34.251
"Mr and Mrs Whittaker". Your mother.

05:35.575 --> 05:37.566
(Hilda) What's it say, Father?

05:38.495 --> 05:40.690
Perhaps your mother
should read this first.

05:40.815 --> 05:45.366
Oh! That stupid, stupid, stupid boy!

05:45.495 --> 05:48.293
(Hilda) What's happened?
Has there been an accident?

05:48.415 --> 05:51.327
It's John, he's married that f-f-f...
- Francophile?

05:51.455 --> 05:53.764
F-f-f...
- Photographer?

05:53.895 --> 05:56.489
Pharmacist?
- Why are you smirking?

05:56.615 --> 05:59.652
Deploying a smile. One member
of this family may actually be happy.

05:59.775 --> 06:03.324
Don't be absurd! We don't know
anything about this woman. Furber!

06:03.455 --> 06:05.093
Furber!

06:05.215 --> 06:07.683
Oh, not again!
- (Furber) Madam.

06:07.815 --> 06:09.806
Lord have mercy.

06:09.935 --> 06:13.405
Mister John is coming home with his...
with his wife.

06:13.535 --> 06:15.765
Yes. Their bags have just arrived.
Congratulations, Madam.

06:15.895 --> 06:19.604
I'll be the judge of that. Clear up this
mess and get Cook to send up a ham.

06:19.735 --> 06:23.569
This is from Dover. They'll be half way.
- Yes, Furber. Dress the mutton as ham.

06:23.695 --> 06:25.765
(Mrs Whittaker) Very sharp,
don't cut yourself.

06:25.895 --> 06:28.329
(Hilda) John married the floozy.
How exciting!

06:41.175 --> 06:45.487
# A room with a view and you

06:45.615 --> 06:48.413
# And no one to worry us

06:48.535 --> 06:54.246
# No one to hurry us through
...this dream we found #

06:54.375 --> 06:56.684
(Tyres screech)

06:56.815 --> 07:00.251
There she blows.
Behold the country cottage.

07:00.375 --> 07:02.366
Oh, Lord, it's enormous.

07:02.495 --> 07:06.283
So, I lied about gingerbread hedges
and obese little children.

07:06.415 --> 07:09.805
How hard to swim is the moat?
- Smoke and mirrors, darling.

07:09.935 --> 07:11.766
Smoke and mirrors.

07:14.135 --> 07:17.764
Oh, by the by, smoking... don't.
Apparently it wilts the azaleas.

07:17.895 --> 07:21.410
That makes no sense. Speak English.
- All will be revealed, darling.

07:23.415 --> 07:27.852
Oh, give me back the wheel of my car.
I'm going back to Detroit!

07:32.975 --> 07:34.806
How romantic!

07:34.935 --> 07:37.972
Here they come! Oh, Furber!

07:38.095 --> 07:40.484
Mister John and his wife
are about to arrive.

07:40.615 --> 07:43.368
I can't see them.
- Your tunnel vision.

07:46.215 --> 07:47.330
Ooh!

07:51.615 --> 07:54.493
Smile, Marion.
- I don't feel like smiling.

07:54.615 --> 07:56.128
You're English, dear. Fake it.

08:05.495 --> 08:08.726
(Jim) The prodigal son returns
in a blaze of gravel.

08:08.855 --> 08:11.050
Father! You shaved.

08:13.655 --> 08:16.169
(Furber) Welcome, Madam.

08:16.295 --> 08:18.934
(John) You look gorgeous.

08:19.055 --> 08:21.091
It's so lovely to see you.

08:25.575 --> 08:27.930
Oh, darling. Sorry, sorry!

08:30.495 --> 08:32.884
This is my wife, Larita.

08:33.934 --> 08:37.086
Mrs Whittaker, the pleasure is all mine.

08:37.215 --> 08:38.693
Oh, you're American.

08:38.815 --> 08:41.453
And very welcome. Jim Whittaker.
- (John) This is my father.

08:41.575 --> 08:44.089
I fought alongside many
of your countrymen, Larita,

08:44.215 --> 08:46.775
and I must say it's an honour
to have a comrade in the family.

08:46.895 --> 08:49.932
Thank you.
I do hope I'm not a disappointment.

08:50.055 --> 08:52.410
Far from it.
- And my two little blisters.

08:52.535 --> 08:54.127
Hilda and Marion.

08:54.255 --> 08:56.815
Aren't you the woman
who won the Grand Prix?

08:56.935 --> 08:58.527
First place, before disqualification.

08:58.655 --> 09:02.489
Apparently you need chest hair
to change gears in Monaco.

09:02.615 --> 09:06.369
I saw you in the paper.
I cut your head out. I could just die!

09:06.495 --> 09:08.008
(Giggling)

09:08.135 --> 09:11.923
Furber, that suitcase
to the drawing room, and do be careful.

09:12.055 --> 09:15.047
Marion... Golly, you're not a bit
like what we imagined.

09:15.175 --> 09:17.973
Somewhat older, I expect.
Awfully sorry about that.

09:20.615 --> 09:22.810
(Jim) Before the frostbite sets in...

09:22.935 --> 09:27.053
I'm looking forward to getting acquainted
with the mother of my "Panda".

09:27.175 --> 09:30.087
You'll find me quite uncomplicated,
I'm afraid.

09:30.215 --> 09:32.126
Oh! What are you doing?

09:32.255 --> 09:34.325
Carrying you over the finish line.

09:38.215 --> 09:41.173
Venus de Milo meet my Venus Detroit.

09:41.295 --> 09:42.774
Oh, hello.

09:42.895 --> 09:45.125
Mother's turned our old nursery
into a boudoir.

09:45.255 --> 09:47.246
I wouldn't exactly call
it a boudoir, Hilda.

09:47.375 --> 09:50.412
Marvellous. All those grubby memories
of Little Johnnie.

09:50.535 --> 09:52.526
(Marion) We had no time
to raid the hothouse.

09:52.655 --> 09:54.805
I only hope we can make you
comfortable.

09:54.935 --> 09:58.007
Don't go to any trouble.
We're only staying a few days.

10:00.255 --> 10:02.325
Aren't we, Johnnie?
- Of course.

10:02.455 --> 10:04.650
And for our next surprise...

10:08.415 --> 10:11.168
What on earth is that?

10:12.415 --> 10:14.849
His master's voice!
A wedding gift from us to you all.

10:14.975 --> 10:18.445
(Hilda) How divine! You should've
got married years ago!

10:18.575 --> 10:25.253
#... another June,
another sunny honeymoon

10:25.375 --> 10:31.245
# Another season, another reason
for making whoopee... #

10:33.335 --> 10:35.565
Come on, little blister. Twirl for me.

10:35.695 --> 10:37.765
(They speak French)

10:41.375 --> 10:46.051
Oh, a Continental education.
Not all of us have been so fortunate.

10:46.175 --> 10:49.212
An emotional depiction of the French
postal service, Mrs Whittaker.

10:49.335 --> 10:52.054
Come now, not Mrs Whittaker.
It's "Mother" now.

10:52.175 --> 10:54.928
I don't think we're quite ready
for that yet.

10:55.055 --> 11:01.005
Since time is so clearly against us, why
don't you show Larita up to the nursery?

11:01.135 --> 11:03.524
Dinner's at 8:00.

11:03.655 --> 11:06.567
You didn't tell them?
- One bombshell at a time, darling.

11:06.695 --> 11:11.052
That's not fair! Your poor mother.
How long are we staying?

11:11.175 --> 11:13.006
A few days?

11:13.135 --> 11:17.765
I shoulder the shortcomings of this family
and what do I get in return? A few days!

11:17.895 --> 11:20.489
Look at her. What am I supposed
to do with the bauble of a woman?

11:20.615 --> 11:22.685
Hang her?
- I think she's splendid.

11:22.815 --> 11:26.251
Do you, Hilda? Well, we can all relax.
- She's not what I expected.

11:26.375 --> 11:28.047
(Mrs Whittaker) She's exactly
what I expected.

11:28.175 --> 11:31.485
Surely not exactly? She wasn't drunk.
- Oh, very funny, Jim.

11:31.615 --> 11:35.085
Reduce this to the burlesque.
- She looks so expensive!

11:35.215 --> 11:37.570
(Mrs Whittaker) Very.
- Hmm. I like her.

11:37.695 --> 11:40.289
Yes, Jim. We all know what you like.

11:40.415 --> 11:41.734
Mother!

11:48.295 --> 11:50.763
Oh, we have all been sent
to our "wombs".

11:52.975 --> 11:55.967
And so toasty.
- Economics in action.

11:56.095 --> 11:58.928
She keeps half the house closed
to save on heating.

11:59.055 --> 12:01.569
That explains the frosty reception.

12:01.695 --> 12:04.892
Well, darling. Let me warm you up.

12:14.095 --> 12:15.687
(Giggling)

12:15.815 --> 12:17.453
(Screams)

12:17.575 --> 12:19.850
(Laughing)

12:26.455 --> 12:29.253
Well?
- She's lovely, I'm very proud of you.

12:29.375 --> 12:31.127
Thanks, Father.

12:31.255 --> 12:35.248
John? How long is a few days?

12:35.375 --> 12:38.333
Mother, Larita and I would like
to find a home in London.

12:38.455 --> 12:42.004
But this is your home.
- A home of their own.

12:44.055 --> 12:46.250
But Panda, we need you here.

12:46.375 --> 12:50.573
Since you went off around the Riviera,
we've had to let go of six more people.

12:50.695 --> 12:52.845
If you'd just listened to me
and taken on some machinery.

12:52.975 --> 12:56.251
Wouldn't that be a good idea? I could
run the entire estate single-handedly.

12:56.375 --> 12:59.924
Congratulations on your insight
and your spontaneity.

13:00.055 --> 13:03.206
Sarah and Philip are coming to dinner
tonight, and I have got a table plan

13:03.335 --> 13:05.565
that will take the League
of Nations to unravel.

13:05.695 --> 13:10.450
Tonight? That's absolutely splendid!
- Don't be so fickle in your affections.

13:10.575 --> 13:12.770
Sarah might not be
as accommodating as you expect.

13:12.895 --> 13:14.772
Codswallop. She'll be delighted.

13:14.895 --> 13:18.888
If mother was so desperate for her hand
in marriage, she should've asked herself!

13:19.015 --> 13:21.085
Strange as it may seem,
I agree with your sister.

13:21.215 --> 13:22.887
I think you're wrong.

13:23.015 --> 13:26.291
On certain things, yes. Call her.

13:26.415 --> 13:28.053
Really?
- (Jim) Really.

13:28.175 --> 13:32.248
Really! If Edgar were here,
he'd do the manly thing.

13:32.375 --> 13:34.764
What? Run away?

13:38.695 --> 13:40.447
Here they come!

13:54.295 --> 13:58.004
And the chequered flag goes to...
Fast work, John!

13:58.135 --> 14:02.128
I should've written, but it happened
so fast, I didn't know where I was.

14:02.255 --> 14:04.371
In Larita's arms, it seems.

14:04.495 --> 14:07.646
Please don't be disappointed.
- Of course I'm disappointed.

14:07.775 --> 14:10.573
But tell me you're happy,
and I'll tell you you're forgiven.

14:10.695 --> 14:14.165
# You're the top,
you're Mahatma Gandhi! #

14:14.295 --> 14:16.763
Panda, don't break out
the brandy just yet.

14:16.895 --> 14:18.567
The hell we're not.

14:18.695 --> 14:22.608
Have I missed something?
- Let sleeping cows stand.

14:22.735 --> 14:24.566
Oh, you plonker!

14:24.695 --> 14:27.653
Rule one, push sleeping cow.

14:27.775 --> 14:30.084
Rule two, get out of the way.

14:30.215 --> 14:32.683
Rule three, remember rule two.

14:32.815 --> 14:35.283
(Mrs Whittaker) Sarah!
It's so lovely to see you.

14:35.415 --> 14:37.610
I hear your poor father
is not having a good day.

14:37.735 --> 14:40.203
I'm afraid not. He sends his love.

14:40.335 --> 14:43.611
You are a jolly good sport,
turning up like this, that's all I can say.

14:43.735 --> 14:46.852
I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Larita is such a pretty name.

14:46.975 --> 14:50.251
Yes. Excellent for musical comedy.
Hilda!

14:50.375 --> 14:53.367
I hear the cow's in a terrible way.
- I've sent flowers.

14:53.495 --> 14:55.611
(John) And did she eat them?
(Philip) Touché!

14:55.735 --> 14:57.487
Good evening to you all.

14:58.295 --> 15:00.251
Nobody told me tonight
was fancy dress!

15:00.375 --> 15:03.287
Then why have you come
as the village idiot?

15:03.415 --> 15:04.643
(Ripping)

15:04.775 --> 15:07.084
(Hilda) I think I'm snagged.

15:07.215 --> 15:09.365
(Larita) Let me help you with that.

15:11.975 --> 15:13.647
Holy mother!

15:14.815 --> 15:19.809
Panda? You're forgiven... tenfold.

15:24.975 --> 15:30.845
Sarah Hurst, I'd like to introduce
my wife, Larita Whittaker.

15:30.975 --> 15:33.887
Gosh, I do like the sound of that.

15:34.015 --> 15:36.131
Sarah... finally.

15:36.255 --> 15:39.725
Johnnie talks about you constantly.
- How very annoying for you.

15:39.855 --> 15:44.690
I hope we can be friends.
- We already are. Congratulations.

15:44.815 --> 15:47.693
Er... I'd like to be friends, too.

15:47.815 --> 15:51.330
Larita, my tiresome brother...
- The dishonourable Philip Hurst.

15:51.455 --> 15:53.764
(Philip) Charmed, my dear lady.
(Larita) Indeed.

15:53.895 --> 15:56.204
Philip, won't you escort me in?

15:56.335 --> 15:59.452
Of course,
my beautiful, little Sausage Fingers.

15:59.575 --> 16:02.089
That's whet my appetite.
Shall we adjourn to the dining room?

16:02.215 --> 16:04.126
And toast my beautiful bride.

16:04.255 --> 16:06.849
Had we known there was to be
a wedding reception,

16:06.975 --> 16:09.364
we could've lashed out on taffeta!

16:09.495 --> 16:13.170
She's a lot like drowning:
quite pleasant once you stop struggling.

16:13.295 --> 16:17.334
(Mrs Whittaker) So, John, was Larita's
family able to attend the wedding?

16:17.455 --> 16:20.606
(Raucous laughter)

16:23.895 --> 16:25.408
More cabbage, Madam?

16:25.535 --> 16:28.049
There's lots to do, Larita.
You ride, don't you?

16:28.175 --> 16:30.405
Boats, cars or planes?

16:30.535 --> 16:33.845
No, horses, silly.
- (Larita) Ah, yes, horses.

16:33.975 --> 16:36.569
Faulty steering and unreliable brakes.

16:37.855 --> 16:39.732
I'm stealing that for Stirrup Cup!

16:39.855 --> 16:41.811
Stirrup what?
- Cup.

16:41.935 --> 16:44.574
Every November, Philip and Sarah's
family host the hunt.

16:44.695 --> 16:46.845
Wait until you meet their father,
Lord Hurst, he's terrific.

16:46.975 --> 16:50.650
And Lady Hurst?
- Was terrific, until she... stopped.

16:52.655 --> 16:54.407
Stopped what?
- Living.

16:55.415 --> 16:57.690
Oh, I'm very sorry to hear that.

16:58.775 --> 17:03.291
Between father's polio
and Philip's mania for tipping cows...

17:03.415 --> 17:05.291
Can we please just drop the cows?

17:05.415 --> 17:07.804
I think we'll give the fox a break
this year.

17:07.935 --> 17:12.133
Oh, no hunt? Mrs Winston gave me
her saddle. I've had a wax.

17:12.255 --> 17:13.688
(Gulps)

17:13.815 --> 17:16.932
Your father and I conspired to make
John the Master of the Hunt.

17:17.055 --> 17:20.172
People come from far and wide.
It's such a shame to disappoint them.

17:20.295 --> 17:21.967
Very thoughtful, Mother.

17:22.095 --> 17:24.689
(Mrs Whittaker) You do hunt,
I take it, Larita?

17:24.815 --> 17:27.772
Hypocrites, gossips
or defenceless animals?

17:27.895 --> 17:29.123
(Philip) Bravo!

17:29.255 --> 17:31.211
(John) You wouldn't get her to the start.

17:31.335 --> 17:34.805
We have another
conscientious objector, Father.

17:34.935 --> 17:39.008
Company! Do you object to the circus
or the slaughter, Major?

17:39.135 --> 17:41.444
I support Sheppard's position
on pacifism.

17:41.575 --> 17:45.284
Good for you.
So, when does the carnage begin?

17:45.415 --> 17:48.930
After the War Widow's Revue,
but before the craft fair,

17:49.055 --> 17:50.852
in between the Dog Show and the shoot.

17:50.975 --> 17:55.127
Don't forget the highlight. Mother's
Christmas dance is the hot ticket.

17:55.255 --> 17:58.292
She's ordered the most exquisite
Japanese lanterns.

17:58.415 --> 18:00.883
From Japan?
- No, Fortnum & Mason's.

18:01.015 --> 18:04.530
Oh, yes.
Prepare for a whirlwind, Larita.

18:05.855 --> 18:07.493
I'm breathless already.

18:11.255 --> 18:14.292
(Larita) I won't make it to Christmas.
(John) You won't need to.

18:14.415 --> 18:16.849
(Larita) I won't make it to breakfast!
What were we just eating?

18:16.975 --> 18:19.443
The lumpy grey and beige concoction?

18:19.575 --> 18:23.534
Oh, yes. That's the word
I was looking for..."greige".

18:23.655 --> 18:26.931
Absolutely no idea.
But it is the speciality of the house.

18:27.055 --> 18:30.206
Incoming! Have you met my namesake?
He's very good in bed.

18:30.335 --> 18:32.895
Shh! They'll hear you.
- I don't care.

18:33.015 --> 18:34.573
I do.

18:35.775 --> 18:38.414
I know we need the heat,
but please don't smoke.

18:38.535 --> 18:40.810
Mother's clairvoyant about these things.

18:40.935 --> 18:43.290
She loathes me, Johnnie.

18:43.415 --> 18:46.805
I'm a gold-digger, burrowing in
from the land of opportunists.

18:48.215 --> 18:50.604
Your father's an interesting study,
though.

18:50.735 --> 18:52.726
Quietly sardonic. I like that in a man.

18:52.855 --> 18:56.006
That won't earn you many
brownie points under this roof.

18:57.575 --> 19:01.011
After the Armistice,
Father didn't come straight home.

19:01.135 --> 19:04.411
He caroused around France and Italy,
drinking, having affairs...

19:04.535 --> 19:07.845
A lot of men did similar...
couldn't settle down.

19:07.975 --> 19:11.206
Why didn't she go after him?
- A question of pride.

19:11.335 --> 19:13.371
He finally just wandered home.

19:13.495 --> 19:16.567
Still a bit of a sore point.
We try not to speak about it.

19:16.695 --> 19:18.048
Except in public.

19:18.175 --> 19:20.973
You see, she feels
she's missed out on something.

19:21.095 --> 19:23.563
Which means, of course,
she's missed out on everything.

19:23.695 --> 19:27.005
Exactly. The war robbed her
of all her expectations.

19:27.135 --> 19:29.729
She takes one look
at a woman like you...

19:29.855 --> 19:32.972
The harlot stealing into the nursery...

19:33.095 --> 19:35.165
The delicious concubine...

19:35.295 --> 19:37.206
...with the delectable ears...

19:37.975 --> 19:39.408
...nose...

19:39.935 --> 19:41.334
...neck.

19:43.095 --> 19:44.528
I could just...

19:45.855 --> 19:47.254
...eat you.

19:47.375 --> 19:49.684
After that meal I'm not surprised.

19:57.655 --> 20:02.331
# '... I'm mad about the boy! ' #

20:11.015 --> 20:13.051
(Larita gasps)

20:15.935 --> 20:18.403
(Erotic moaning)

20:27.095 --> 20:29.131
(Moaning)

20:31.095 --> 20:32.892
(Groaning)

20:35.095 --> 20:38.087
(Panting and moaning)

20:41.775 --> 20:46.246
Dear Lord, thank you for bringing
John and his floozy home safely.

20:51.455 --> 20:53.491
(Sighs heavily)

20:54.575 --> 20:57.567
(Larita) 'Hmm... John! '

21:06.135 --> 21:09.684
Why is Larita always so late?
- You can't hurry perfection.

21:09.815 --> 21:14.013
Edgar was never late for a meal.
- (John) He's missed a few lately.

21:14.135 --> 21:17.571
(Larita) Good morning.
How are we all on this glorious day?

21:17.695 --> 21:21.244
There she is! Morning, darling.

21:21.375 --> 21:22.933
(Dog yaps)

21:24.095 --> 21:26.211
What would Madam like for breakfast?

21:26.935 --> 21:29.847
I think Madam will get more sustenance
from a kipper.

21:29.975 --> 21:33.092
But it won't be as much fun.
- Aren't you riding with us?

21:33.215 --> 21:35.445
Darling, I think it's about high time

21:35.575 --> 21:39.363
that your mother and I have
an intimate tête-à-tête.

21:39.495 --> 21:42.805
Just us girls.
- Lovely.

21:42.935 --> 21:45.244
(John) What a frightening thought.

21:47.535 --> 21:54.452
Two hemispheres under one roof.
Papua New Guinea, India, the Argentine.

21:57.855 --> 22:00.653
I may not have travelled,
but the world has come to me.

22:00.775 --> 22:03.892
(Sneezes)
- Are you coming down with something?

22:04.015 --> 22:07.087
Pollen.
But if I hold my breath long enough...

22:07.215 --> 22:08.887
How peculiar.

22:09.015 --> 22:11.210
Which is why we should
get to know one another.

22:11.335 --> 22:14.133
(Mrs Whittaker) Where does one start?
- Shall I make headway?

22:14.255 --> 22:17.691
I was born in Detroit.
My father worked in the steel plant.

22:17.815 --> 22:20.375
He was one of the first
lured over to Henry Ford.

22:20.495 --> 22:22.406
Ah, hence the love of motoring?

22:22.535 --> 22:24.890
Yes, but I also love animals.

22:25.015 --> 22:27.085
I am a city girl.
I take chickens to the vet.

22:27.215 --> 22:28.773
Oh!

22:28.895 --> 22:32.854
You can't be squeamish about livestock
now that you are living in the country.

22:32.975 --> 22:34.966
Which was never my intention.

22:35.095 --> 22:37.848
I was happily carving out a niche
for myself on the race circuit

22:37.975 --> 22:42.093
when I was unexpectedly flagged down
by someone irresistible.

22:43.815 --> 22:47.524
Remarrying was the farthest thing
from my mind.

22:47.655 --> 22:49.327
(Sneezes)

22:49.455 --> 22:51.093
I see...

22:53.535 --> 22:55.207
May I ask?

22:56.095 --> 22:59.531
Oh, dead, unfortunately. No children.

22:59.655 --> 23:03.489
Oh...
How disappointing for you.

23:03.615 --> 23:05.890
Still, he provided well, though?

23:06.015 --> 23:10.611
Yes, but there were a lot of hidden costs
associated with his passing.

23:10.735 --> 23:15.525
Oh, that beautiful motor car... Surely,
you must have independent means?

23:15.655 --> 23:18.249
I'm more than happy
to discuss my means,

23:18.375 --> 23:20.570
but I think you'll be a tad disappointed.

23:20.695 --> 23:22.970
The car is my sole source of income.

23:23.095 --> 23:26.132
Which makes living in London
an imperative.

23:26.255 --> 23:28.644
But what will John do in the city?

23:28.775 --> 23:31.050
Work. It's not uncommon.

23:31.175 --> 23:32.767
Oh!

23:33.815 --> 23:36.773
John was brought up in the country,
Larita.

23:36.895 --> 23:38.931
Where will he work?

23:39.055 --> 23:42.809
Chalk Farm, perhaps?
Or St-Martin-In-The-Fields?

23:42.935 --> 23:47.213
I know this is not perfect so that's
why I'm asking for your guidance.

23:47.335 --> 23:50.486
So, please, how can I make this
pleasant for everybody?

23:50.615 --> 23:55.245
Well, erm... wartime experience dictates
that you keep your head down

23:55.375 --> 23:57.252
and you fit in as well as you can.

23:57.375 --> 24:01.926
Oh, there's a war on?
- Oh, no... not necessarily.

24:02.815 --> 24:05.852
Australian mimosa. Mmm... beautiful.

24:07.095 --> 24:09.290
(Sneezes)
- Oh...

24:14.095 --> 24:18.134
And then the British troops opened fire...
How grizzly!

24:18.255 --> 24:21.611
How'd it go, Mother?
- Oh, marvellous!

24:21.735 --> 24:22.929
Marvellous.

24:26.215 --> 24:28.649
(# Brass band version of "Car Wash")

24:28.775 --> 24:30.766
(Woman) Thanks for the invitation!

24:34.095 --> 24:36.848
(Laughing and chatting)

24:38.495 --> 24:40.372
Thanks for the invitation!

24:40.495 --> 24:42.929
(Man) Oh, it's Lord Hurst!

24:43.055 --> 24:45.853
I fear storm clouds are gathering,
Mrs Whit.

24:45.975 --> 24:48.011
Stop being maudlin, Father.

24:48.135 --> 24:50.205
It's the future!
- (John) Spanner!

24:50.335 --> 24:54.613
Father, allow me to introduce
Panda's new chauffeuse.

24:54.735 --> 24:58.250
Lovely La-La-Larita.
- (John) Watch it, Philip.

24:58.375 --> 25:01.606
My son is prone to fabrication,
but I can see on this occasion

25:01.735 --> 25:04.329
he has been perfectly frank,
Mrs Whittaker.

25:05.415 --> 25:09.249
Yes, that's right.
There are two of us now.

25:09.375 --> 25:11.969
(Philip) No shortage of wits
around here any more.

25:12.095 --> 25:15.485
OK, stand back! I give you, the future!

25:16.495 --> 25:18.292
(Engine revs)

25:19.815 --> 25:22.648
(Hurst) All right, John.
You can take my baby out for a spin.

25:22.775 --> 25:24.174
(Sneezes)

25:24.295 --> 25:27.571
Ha-ha! Allergies.
She inflates like a puffer fish.

25:27.695 --> 25:30.129
You just want to squeeze her
until she pops.

25:30.255 --> 25:32.928
#... working at the car wash

25:37.255 --> 25:39.564
# You might not ever strike it rich

25:41.135 --> 25:44.093
# But let me tell you,
it's better than digging a ditch

25:44.215 --> 25:47.491
# Working at the car wash!

25:47.615 --> 25:50.209
# Working at the car wash, man

25:50.335 --> 25:52.974
# Come on, now, sing it to me

25:53.975 --> 25:56.489
# It's better than digging a ditch... #

25:58.255 --> 25:59.529
(Bell rings)

26:01.615 --> 26:03.367
(Bell rings)

26:07.975 --> 26:10.694
The missus is a bit trigger-happy
this week.

26:10.815 --> 26:12.692
Bleeding tinnitus is killing me.

26:12.815 --> 26:16.933
I like the new Mrs Whit. Reminds me
of the old one before the war.

26:17.055 --> 26:20.127
Only more reasonable. You can tell
she's run her own household.

26:20.255 --> 26:21.893
Oh, be silent!

26:22.015 --> 26:25.644
Good morning,
Furber, Jackson, Millie, and?

26:25.775 --> 26:28.448
Cook, I can't call you a verb.
Your name?

26:29.255 --> 26:30.654
Beatrice.

26:34.055 --> 26:37.934
All right, all right... it's Doris.
Sorry, Madam.

26:38.055 --> 26:40.489
Always wanted to be called Beatrice.

26:40.615 --> 26:45.086
Well, Beatrice, would you mind
if I helped myself in the mornings?

26:45.215 --> 26:48.207
I fear I shall be rising later and later.

26:48.335 --> 26:50.724
Well... if it pleases, Mrs Whit.

26:52.855 --> 26:54.652
The point of the bell?

26:54.775 --> 26:57.847
When I ring it, you come to me,
not the other way round!

26:58.935 --> 27:00.971
Larita. May I have a word?

27:02.135 --> 27:03.773
Come along!

27:06.575 --> 27:09.373
Would you please refrain
from chatting to the staff?

27:09.495 --> 27:12.134
It's chore enough trying to keep
this motley crew together.

27:12.255 --> 27:16.168
I had a brilliant French maid in Paris.
Perhaps I should send for her?

27:16.295 --> 27:18.604
Thank you, no... erm...

27:18.735 --> 27:22.933
I'd prefer to keep English
the first language in this household.

27:23.055 --> 27:24.613
Ah, there you are.

27:24.735 --> 27:27.124
(Mock English accent)
I say! Anyone for tennis?

27:27.255 --> 27:28.529
Yes. You!

27:28.655 --> 27:30.964
John, Shackleton wouldn't let
a dog out today!

27:31.095 --> 27:33.086
The fog has lifted
and Whittakers don't do winter.

27:33.215 --> 27:36.332
You go ahead, darling.
I'll play with myself.

27:36.455 --> 27:39.447
No, really. I'm a lot of fun.
- Ooh...

27:39.575 --> 27:42.169
(Philip) John!
It's brass monkeys out here!

27:45.855 --> 27:49.291
Day one of the Antarctic Open.
Mister Whittaker to serve.

27:50.735 --> 27:52.373
(Screams)

27:52.495 --> 27:54.611
(Philip) Hole in one!
- Deuce.

27:54.735 --> 27:58.523
(Philip) I see your pair of deuces
and I raise you a tenner.

27:58.655 --> 28:01.488
The Titanic could have hit that!

28:01.615 --> 28:05.369
Sarah, you're an embarrassment to
the family name. I'll have you killed.

28:05.495 --> 28:09.044
Good God! What's wrong with you?
No! Stop now!

28:09.175 --> 28:12.247
Stop, everybody! Listen!
- (Sarah) Shoot the court jester!

28:12.375 --> 28:16.163
(John) Nice backhand!
- (Philip) Is that a backhand compliment?

28:16.295 --> 28:19.367
# Mad dogs and Englishmen
go out in the midday sun!

28:19.495 --> 28:22.851
# The Japanese don't care to,
the Chinese wouldn't dare to

28:22.975 --> 28:25.773
# Hindus and Argentines sleep firmly
from twelve to one

28:25.895 --> 28:29.092
# But Englishmen detest a siesta... #

28:29.215 --> 28:32.571
(Philip) Laurel and Hardy step up
to the crease. The fillies are lining up.

28:32.695 --> 28:36.324
Miss Hilda Whittaker looking most
fetching in her feed bag and bridle!

28:42.855 --> 28:44.925
One woman's heaven...

28:46.255 --> 28:48.052
Oh, she's absolutely beautiful.

28:50.295 --> 28:53.810
Broken, tarnished
and completely useless.

28:55.055 --> 28:58.934
Things guaranteed
to keep my wife at bay.

28:59.055 --> 29:00.693
May I?

29:00.815 --> 29:03.124
If you don't mind
getting your hands dirty.

29:03.255 --> 29:06.930
In Detroit, what we lack in dirt,
we make up for in filth.

29:07.055 --> 29:10.047
Your first husband
from that neck of the woods?

29:10.175 --> 29:12.564
Oh... well, word gets about.

29:14.775 --> 29:17.448
So where is he now?
- Dead.

29:19.535 --> 29:21.332
Cancer.

29:21.455 --> 29:23.685
He was a fair bit older than me.

29:23.815 --> 29:27.410
I spent a while playing the unmerry
widow but the black wore thin.

29:28.255 --> 29:31.804
You didn't care for him, I gather?
- I cared too much.

29:31.935 --> 29:35.610
Life was just such an unpleasant
experience for the man, I...

29:36.175 --> 29:39.326
I'd be a liar to say I wasn't glad
when he was relieved of it.

29:39.455 --> 29:42.652
(Jim speaks French)

29:47.575 --> 29:50.806
When were you last in France?
- Just after the war?

29:50.935 --> 29:52.812
On a personal reconnaissance,

29:52.935 --> 29:57.565
trying to ascertain what exactly
all those fine young men had died for.

29:59.135 --> 30:01.774
Apparently, I'm of the romantic
Lost Generation.

30:03.015 --> 30:04.687
What did you lose?

30:05.655 --> 30:07.646
I'm not sure.

30:10.135 --> 30:12.285
(# Gramophone playing)

30:56.135 --> 30:57.807

31:03.455 --> 31:05.810
Oh, hello... hello.

31:05.935 --> 31:09.610
Who was the tiny tank?
Who's a pretty, little, cheeky chorizo?

31:10.855 --> 31:14.165
On bended knees,
please come and play with me.

31:14.295 --> 31:16.411
Johnnie dear,
you know how much I love you,

31:16.535 --> 31:20.084
so please try to take this
in the best possible light.

31:20.215 --> 31:24.128
I'm getting a machine gun
and mowing down your entire family.

31:24.255 --> 31:27.725
That's fairly disappointing. I thought
you and Father were getting along.

31:27.855 --> 31:30.369
Yes, I might spare the men folk.

31:30.495 --> 31:34.044
But it's awfully dispiriting.
We have absolutely no privacy here.

31:34.175 --> 31:36.564
I never needed any privacy before.
This is my home.

31:36.695 --> 31:39.289
It's not mine.
And I very much want one.

31:40.655 --> 31:45.524
# We're all alone,
no chaperone can get our number

31:45.655 --> 31:49.614
# The world's aslumber,
let's misbehave

31:49.735 --> 31:50.963
(Dog yaps)

31:52.695 --> 31:55.289
Timing is everything, you little brute!

31:55.415 --> 31:58.566
Umpire at least.
Philip is pining for you.

31:58.695 --> 32:02.449
If I knew you played tennis, I never
would've signed the marriage certificate!

32:02.575 --> 32:04.247
(John) Ow!

32:06.375 --> 32:08.047
(Sighs heavily)

32:08.175 --> 32:09.574

32:10.335 --> 32:12.166

32:14.335 --> 32:15.927
(Door opens)

32:17.015 --> 32:19.449
(Marion) Not a bad day for it.

32:19.575 --> 32:21.293
Reading.

32:21.415 --> 32:24.168
My fiancé, Edgar,
was always hiding behind books.

32:24.295 --> 32:28.607
Erm... you're needed on the tennis court.
John was just asking after you.

32:28.735 --> 32:31.807
Would you like to see
a photo of him... my Edgar?

32:31.935 --> 32:33.129
Poppy!

32:36.255 --> 32:39.292
That's Enrico Caruso.
- Who's dead, I know that...

32:39.415 --> 32:42.725
But if you ignore
the nose and the mouth...

32:42.855 --> 32:46.131
...and the ears...
there's a striking resemblance.

32:47.975 --> 32:50.011
I don't actually have a picture of Edgar.

32:51.375 --> 32:53.331
Well... mustn't keep you.

32:53.455 --> 32:57.334
No, no. Of course. Looking forward
to getting stuck in to a good book.

32:57.455 --> 32:59.411
(Mrs Whittaker) Poppy!

32:59.535 --> 33:02.129
You haven't seen the beast, have you?
- The dog?

33:02.255 --> 33:04.485
Nope. I haven't.

33:06.135 --> 33:07.534
(Mrs Whittaker) Poppy!

33:13.215 --> 33:16.571
Oh, poor, poor Poppy. I'm so sorry.

33:16.695 --> 33:18.333
(Hilda) Larita!

33:20.575 --> 33:24.932
I've been sent in to badger you.
Please help us make up doubles?

33:25.055 --> 33:29.526
Oh, Hilda, I can't. I'm only good
for the cocktails between sets.

33:29.655 --> 33:33.807
We're between sets now.
- You can't possibly want me on court.

33:35.055 --> 33:37.569
Philip! Go get him.

33:40.255 --> 33:42.132
(Mrs Whittaker) Poppy!

33:42.255 --> 33:43.927
(Door closes)

33:44.055 --> 33:45.568
(Mrs Whittaker) Poppy!

33:45.695 --> 33:47.174
Poppy!

33:50.575 --> 33:52.327
What are you doing?
- (Marion) Reading.

33:52.455 --> 33:55.367
"Sodom and Gomorrah:
A Biblical Story".

33:55.495 --> 33:57.929
(Mrs Whittaker) Who gave you this filth?

34:01.375 --> 34:04.447
Go and find the dog! Larita!

34:06.815 --> 34:10.603
Please refrain from giving my daughter
pornographic literature.

34:10.735 --> 34:12.168
Yes, yes, of course.

34:12.295 --> 34:14.855
Oh, and I've volunteered you and Hilda

34:14.975 --> 34:18.524
to perform the Dance of the Dying Swan
for the War Widows' Revue.

34:18.655 --> 34:20.407
We're short on numbers.

34:20.534 --> 34:22.889
Lovely. Anything to help.

34:23.014 --> 34:24.607
Have you seen the dog?

34:24.735 --> 34:26.804
No. Not recently.

34:26.935 --> 34:30.643
Probably out seizing the sunshine
like everyone else.

34:34.375 --> 34:36.172
Poppy!

34:38.614 --> 34:40.014
Furber!

34:44.094 --> 34:47.485
Oh, it's you, Madam. I'm sorry.
Can I get you anything?

34:47.614 --> 34:51.210
A shovel.
- Shovel. Of course.

34:51.895 --> 34:54.329
Go and get Philip a hot toddy.

34:54.455 --> 35:00.451
Philip. You look so... so... so...
- (Philip) The suspense is killing me.

35:00.575 --> 35:02.088
(Mrs Whittaker) Poppy!

35:02.775 --> 35:05.243
Oh... sorry.
- It's fine.

35:13.455 --> 35:15.969
Your brother is such
a sharply honed twit.

35:16.095 --> 35:18.404
(Giggles)

35:18.535 --> 35:22.972
Where's our beautiful cougar hiding?
- Under a book, I expect.

35:23.095 --> 35:25.689
I wish she wouldn't slack indoors
so much.

35:25.815 --> 35:29.330
Some people would kill
to be indoors with Larita.

35:29.455 --> 35:31.446
She isn't built the same as us.

35:31.575 --> 35:33.452
Still, it is annoying, though.

35:33.575 --> 35:36.294
You're such a sport,
always ready for anything.

35:36.415 --> 35:42.126
I haven't got Lari's beauty
or charm or intelligence.

35:42.255 --> 35:44.849
She is clever, isn't she?
- Hmm...

35:44.975 --> 35:48.285
Clever... and bored.

35:48.415 --> 35:52.966
I don't understand it. I'm not bored,
you're not bored, nobody else is bored.

35:53.095 --> 35:55.609
Your father is, out of his mind.

35:55.735 --> 35:57.566
Father was born bored.

35:58.495 --> 36:00.850
If only she made an effort to play along.

36:00.975 --> 36:03.443
Stop being so torturous, Panda.

36:03.575 --> 36:06.009
You had her playing charades last night.
What more do you want?

36:06.135 --> 36:09.047
(Mrs Whittaker) John! John?

36:13.895 --> 36:18.127
To tell the truth, I never really liked her.
Crabby, snappy, little bitch...

36:19.095 --> 36:22.087
I didn't like the dog much, either.
- (Jackson chuckles)

36:24.095 --> 36:27.371
Poor Poppy. Casualty of war.

36:30.375 --> 36:32.730
If I may be so bold, Madam?

36:32.855 --> 36:36.894
These people ride horses.
Lots of horses.

36:37.015 --> 36:39.813
It would be advantageous
to do the same.

36:41.895 --> 36:44.773
And I thought Detroit was a tough town.

36:47.575 --> 36:54.367
# You do something to me

36:55.415 --> 37:02.048
# Something that simply
mystifies me... #

37:05.575 --> 37:07.964
Oh, has your horse run out of gas?

37:09.215 --> 37:10.853
(Barking)

37:16.855 --> 37:18.925
Oh, John, don't hurt it.

37:19.055 --> 37:23.890
Far from it. We've got a hunt coming up.
Poor little mite needs a head start.

37:25.495 --> 37:27.372
Go on... run!

37:30.295 --> 37:33.731
So much to learn about each other.

37:35.415 --> 37:40.045
My curriculum vitae. The brook
is the border of Sarah's property.

37:40.175 --> 37:44.293
Mother always imagined
we'd join forces and invade Surrey.

37:44.415 --> 37:46.292
(Distant voices)

37:46.415 --> 37:49.885
Oh, and how about
those foot soldiers on high?

37:50.015 --> 37:54.167
(John) That's Davis, Lord Hurst's man.
And there's Lord Hurst...

37:54.295 --> 37:56.445
Closely followed by my mother-in-law.

37:56.575 --> 37:59.248
I wonder what the devil
they're surveying?

38:02.015 --> 38:05.212
Are you disappointed
you didn't marry Sarah?

38:05.335 --> 38:08.964
Of course not. We've seen each other
naked since we were one.

38:09.095 --> 38:12.212
She's part of the... the... the...
scenery.

38:13.455 --> 38:15.889
You can hack it a little while longer,
can't you?

38:16.015 --> 38:20.054
How long is a little?
And don't say two weeks again.

38:20.175 --> 38:23.611
Well, there's the War Widows' Revue,
the craft fair...

38:23.735 --> 38:25.293
...the hunt.

38:25.415 --> 38:29.044
The memorial service...
- What memorial service?

38:30.855 --> 38:34.131
Friends, we are gathered here today

38:34.255 --> 38:38.089
in remembrance
of our missing friend, Poppy.

38:38.215 --> 38:39.933
Oh, Poppy...

38:40.895 --> 38:44.331
Wherever you have chosen
to sow your seeds,

38:44.455 --> 38:47.015
we pray that you are blooming.

38:47.135 --> 38:49.695
We pray that you have gone
to a better place.

38:49.815 --> 38:53.171
Shame we don't know
exactly where that place is...

38:53.295 --> 38:56.685
Anyway, now for a eulogy
from Emily Dickinson, queen of mirth.

38:56.815 --> 38:58.692
(Barking)

38:58.815 --> 39:03.445
"Because I could not stop for death,
he kindly stopped for me.

39:03.575 --> 39:07.329
"The carriage held but just ourselves
and immortality."

39:07.455 --> 39:12.051
Or maybe the carriage didn't stop
and Poppy got squished.

39:12.175 --> 39:14.530
Scraped off the road
and put in a sausage...

39:14.655 --> 39:17.374
(Hilda giggles)
- (Mrs Whittaker) Oh, Hilda!

39:17.495 --> 39:18.928

39:19.055 --> 39:21.046

39:25.255 --> 39:27.450
(Woman) Thank you, Mr Gribble.

39:28.175 --> 39:31.611
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

39:31.735 --> 39:36.047
behold Reverend Burton
and Marion Whittaker

39:36.175 --> 39:41.124
as they reach for the scissors
in "Samson and Delilah".

39:41.255 --> 39:43.450
(Applause)

39:49.415 --> 39:50.814
(Snoring)

39:52.295 --> 39:55.332
Hark! I hear my husband snore!

39:56.535 --> 40:00.733
What the hell happened to Delilah?
Looks like a sock full of oranges.

40:00.855 --> 40:06.885
I'll creep forth on padded foot
and relieve him of his ample follicles.

40:07.015 --> 40:08.414
(Snoring)

40:10.775 --> 40:12.766
(Laughing and clapping)

40:29.615 --> 40:32.812
(Hilda) How hilarious!
- It's meant to be a tragedy!

40:32.935 --> 40:35.244
Then you succeeded
beyond your wildest dreams.

40:35.375 --> 40:38.173
(Larita) Your father seems
to have a fan.

40:38.295 --> 40:41.526
Don't read too much into it. She was
a godsend during mother's last months.

40:41.655 --> 40:44.294
Sometimes I wonder where they'd be
without each other.

40:44.415 --> 40:46.804
My ample follicles are in dire need
of a trim.

40:49.095 --> 40:52.690
I wouldn't taunt the artistes,
my little dying swans. You're on next.

40:52.815 --> 40:56.490
I've encouraged my girls to undertake
something a little more contemporary.

40:56.615 --> 40:59.288
Hilda and I seem to have a talent
for the can-can.

40:59.415 --> 41:02.293
The traditional can-can,
performed without underwear?

41:02.415 --> 41:05.725
Oh, Philip!
- Anything for you, Philip.

41:05.855 --> 41:07.493
Yes, anything.

41:07.615 --> 41:10.368
That'll raise a bit more than money
for the war widows.

41:10.495 --> 41:13.805
I'm doubling my donation.
- Oh, Pinkie.

41:13.935 --> 41:16.130
Fans at the ready, gentlemen!

41:16.255 --> 41:19.247
All the way from gay Paris,

41:19.375 --> 41:22.173
I give you Miss Hilda Whittaker

41:22.295 --> 41:27.210

42:56.255 --> 42:59.884
(John) It's not Lari's fault.
(Hilda) She said it was traditional!

43:00.015 --> 43:02.245
Philip said it, not Larita.
And it was a joke.

43:02.375 --> 43:04.570
Everyone understood that
except Nelly No Knickers here!

43:04.695 --> 43:08.324
Hilda isn't as experienced
as your wife, John. No one is.

43:08.455 --> 43:11.527
If you're not prepared to have a straight
talk to her, then I certainly am.

43:11.655 --> 43:13.611
Don't be ridiculous.
You'll lose a finger.

43:13.735 --> 43:17.808
Lord Hurst will never speak to me.
- Rubbish. I saw you in the back fields.

43:17.935 --> 43:20.574
Preparing the jumps for the hunt!

43:20.695 --> 43:24.290
I'm completely humiliated!
I'll never get a husband now!

43:24.415 --> 43:26.724
After tonight, I'd have thought
they'll be lining up round the block.

43:26.855 --> 43:29.892
(Hilda) I hate her! Hate, hate, hate her!

43:31.575 --> 43:34.806
The advance notices
are sensational, Mrs John.

43:34.935 --> 43:37.529
(Cutlery tinkling on crockery)

43:44.815 --> 43:49.411
Is it my imagination or is the cutlery
particularly deafening this evening?

43:49.535 --> 43:53.244
I don't know how many times
I have to say this, Hilda. I am sorry.

43:53.375 --> 43:57.687
That's easy for you to say.
- It's surprisingly hard to be easy.

43:59.055 --> 44:02.764
You're smiling, Jim.
- God forbid, the wind might change.

44:05.375 --> 44:08.811
Hilda, if I had any inkling that you
were going to take me seriously...

44:08.935 --> 44:11.085
You could have made an effort
to enjoy it less.

44:11.215 --> 44:14.651
I had my underpants on.
I was having a grand time.

44:15.895 --> 44:20.889
It's not fair! You've got two husbands,
and I've had none.

44:21.015 --> 44:23.813
Technically, I have one.
- But you've had two.

44:23.935 --> 44:26.290
I've had two shoes
and it's a great deal more practical.

44:26.415 --> 44:29.805
I dare say you've worn down
more soles than that.

44:32.695 --> 44:34.606
John...

44:34.735 --> 44:38.171
Marion, Larita's first husband died
of cancer. Stop being so callous.

44:38.295 --> 44:40.855
Oh, I'm sure Marion
can appreciate the pain

44:40.975 --> 44:43.648
of watching a loved one
slip through her fingers.

44:43.775 --> 44:45.686
She's scandalous!

44:46.975 --> 44:49.728
You should hear what they're saying
about her in the village.

44:49.855 --> 44:52.005
Well, let's stop the wagging tongues,
shall we?

44:52.135 --> 44:55.445
Is it true you've had
as many lovers as they say?

44:57.815 --> 45:00.887
Of course it's not true, Mrs Whittaker.

45:01.015 --> 45:03.848
Hardly any of them actually loved me.

45:06.415 --> 45:09.487
That was uncalled for.
I realise it was a joke, but still...

45:09.615 --> 45:13.608
You threw me to the wolves in there.
- Marion hardly constitutes wolves.

45:13.735 --> 45:17.614
All right, you threw me to the voles.
Either way, you abandoned me.

45:17.735 --> 45:19.930
Your sisters need to be restrained.

45:20.055 --> 45:24.253
Restrained? Hilda breaks loose once
and she's almost institutionalised.

45:24.375 --> 45:27.048
And poor old Marion...
Edgar drops by for a cup of sugar,

45:27.175 --> 45:29.484
and mother has his name
engraved on the family crypt.

45:29.615 --> 45:32.175
I'm sorry but it really is very funny.
- Hilarious!

45:32.295 --> 45:34.445
Welcome to the petrified circus.

45:34.575 --> 45:37.851
Meet the resident contortionist
who can't bend any further.

45:37.975 --> 45:41.934
Then stop. Be yourself.
Let them live in your spell.

45:42.055 --> 45:46.810
# You do that voodoo
that you do so well... #

45:46.935 --> 45:51.087
You're right, of course. I'm a hypocrite,
pretending to be someone I'm not.

45:51.215 --> 45:53.934
Especially since it isn't working.

45:54.855 --> 45:58.245
What the devil has that dog dug up?

46:01.135 --> 46:03.126
(Marion) Pilot, what have you got there?

46:03.255 --> 46:04.688
(Screams)

46:04.815 --> 46:07.090
How could you not tell us?

46:07.215 --> 46:10.525
Marion, it was an accident.
I am walking on eggshells here.

46:10.655 --> 46:15.092
And I believe I panicked.
And once again, I'm very, very sorry.

46:15.215 --> 46:18.412
(Marion sobs)
- How could you do it? How could you?

46:18.535 --> 46:23.165
I imagine she lowered her full weight
onto the Chihuahua beneath her.

46:23.295 --> 46:24.853
(Sobbing)

46:24.975 --> 46:26.966
Marion, please.

46:27.095 --> 46:30.132
John, did you have anything
to do with this?

46:30.255 --> 46:34.009
No. No, I was the sole perpetrator
of Poppy's demise.

46:34.135 --> 46:36.968
And ever since
I have been wracked with guilt.

46:37.455 --> 46:41.289
Please, please, please
let me buy you a new dog.

46:42.455 --> 46:45.367
You might buy your loved ones
in the United States,

46:45.495 --> 46:47.690
but you can't in the United Kingdom.

46:47.815 --> 46:49.089
How unfortunate.

46:49.215 --> 46:52.844
You could at least show some remorse.

46:52.975 --> 46:57.287
I am full of remorse. I just refuse
to invest in amateur theatrics

46:57.415 --> 46:58.973
to convince you of my sincerity.

46:59.095 --> 47:02.167
That's not how I came off
the assembly line. I'm sorry.

47:02.295 --> 47:03.933
I can't change.

47:04.055 --> 47:08.207
Not for you...
not for anybody... any more.

47:11.095 --> 47:14.610
And I wouldn't want her
any other way. So...

47:17.775 --> 47:22.405
Madam, the dog.
- Oh, stay back! Stay back!

47:23.735 --> 47:28.411
(Marion) I knew it the second
I laid eyes on her. She's a killer.

47:28.535 --> 47:30.605
She sat on poor Poppy deliberately.

47:30.735 --> 47:33.329
Don't be ridiculous.
Of course she didn't.

47:33.455 --> 47:37.687
My brother has married a dog murderer.
She should be put down.

47:37.815 --> 47:39.646
(Mrs Whittaker)
Put through a divorce court.

47:39.775 --> 47:41.572
(Marion) The Lord does not
sanction divorce.

47:41.695 --> 47:44.926
The Lord is Almighty, Marion.
He can sanction anything he likes.

47:45.055 --> 47:46.886
(Marion) The sooner they move out
the better.

47:47.015 --> 47:50.564
They move out?
John isn't going anywhere.

47:50.695 --> 47:52.447
Watch and learn.

47:54.255 --> 47:56.291
(Voices upstairs)

47:57.735 --> 48:00.886
(Hilda) It's so unfair.
Why can't I have a room like this?

48:02.215 --> 48:03.853
(Giggling)

48:03.975 --> 48:07.172
(Hilda) I could die of envy!

48:07.295 --> 48:09.650
Laying to rest this tragic incident,

48:09.775 --> 48:13.529
we've had this splendid set of rooms
made over for you, haven't we, Jim?

48:13.655 --> 48:16.727
Yes. My wife would like you
to rest in peace.

48:16.855 --> 48:20.734
I even had an old friend of Johnnie's
brought down from the attic.

48:20.855 --> 48:23.369
"Old Faithful Awaits
His Master's Return".

48:23.495 --> 48:26.293
I used to sleep under
that silly painting.

48:26.415 --> 48:29.134
Very comforting, I'm sure,
but we're expected back in Mayfair.

48:29.255 --> 48:32.008
But these are the largest rooms
in the house.

48:32.135 --> 48:34.126
You'll find nothing like it in London.

48:34.255 --> 48:36.246
She has a point.
- (Jim) She always does.

48:36.375 --> 48:39.412
Sometimes I don't know
why you ever did wander home.

48:39.535 --> 48:41.014
And miss all the fun?

48:41.615 --> 48:44.175
Cook would like to inform you,
Mrs Whittaker, the bird is stuffed.

48:44.295 --> 48:46.013
Oh!

48:46.135 --> 48:48.126
What bird, hmm?

48:48.255 --> 48:51.053
Thursday is bubble and squeak.
I hadn't made any arrangements.

48:51.175 --> 48:53.131
Oh, but I have!

48:58.375 --> 49:02.334
In appreciation of your understanding
and for that delicious double bed.

49:02.455 --> 49:05.208
We'll think of you every time we use it.

49:12.135 --> 49:15.207
What exactly are we celebrating?
- Thanksgiving.

49:15.335 --> 49:17.291
Thanks for what, hmm?

49:17.415 --> 49:20.851
The annihilation
of an entire indigenous people.

49:20.975 --> 49:23.773
A loving union of two great cultures.

49:23.895 --> 49:26.773
Just like us.
- How transcontinental.

49:26.895 --> 49:29.853
I can't believe you got into the kitchen.
- Beatrice did put up a fight.

49:29.975 --> 49:33.092
But technically I outrank her.
- Who's Beatrice?

49:33.215 --> 49:38.414
Your cook. Or now my undercook,
since I'm qualified cordon bleu.

49:38.535 --> 49:40.605
That's a degree.

49:40.735 --> 49:45.126
Furber... take the vegetables down to
the kitchen and tell Cook to cook them.

49:45.255 --> 49:49.567
No, Furber, thank you.
I think I'll surprise my alimentary canal.

49:50.695 --> 49:54.051
Mother, if you don't mind, I'm going
to eat my meal before it gets cold.

49:54.175 --> 49:56.131
Furber, I've changed my mind,
bring it back!

49:56.255 --> 49:57.324
Me, too.

49:59.215 --> 50:01.206
Gobble, gobble!

50:06.255 --> 50:07.654
Yes!

50:11.455 --> 50:13.013
(Larita) Here's a tip, Hilda.

50:13.135 --> 50:16.445
A sure way to a man's heart is
through his stomach. Or his mother.

50:16.575 --> 50:20.773
Larita, look, I've found
another likeness of Edgar.

50:20.895 --> 50:24.410
Marion, this is Fatty Arbuckle.
- Who's in jail, I know that.

50:24.535 --> 50:27.732
But if you cut out his cheeks
and give him a bald patch,

50:27.855 --> 50:30.244
there's a striking resemblance...

50:30.375 --> 50:33.173
Edgar's away on a trip
across the pond,

50:33.295 --> 50:36.128
sewing his wild oats,
or something agricultural.

50:37.655 --> 50:41.443
She's good, I'll give her that.
- I think you're over-reacting.

50:41.575 --> 50:42.974
(Sneezes)

50:47.895 --> 50:50.363
Lari? Lari!

50:51.335 --> 50:53.895
Not the vase! Not the vase!

50:54.015 --> 50:57.291
"Taking the corncockle buds
and bee-kissed roses

50:57.415 --> 50:59.406
"roughly in his calloused hands,

50:59.535 --> 51:04.814
"his hot, moist tulip exploded
in her river of delights..."

51:06.695 --> 51:08.208
(Car engine)

51:15.495 --> 51:17.372
(John) Larita?

51:17.495 --> 51:19.531
Early Christmas present...

51:19.655 --> 51:22.772
For you, darling.
- Ooh, the mind boggles.

51:30.295 --> 51:31.694
(John) Well, it's... it's...

51:31.815 --> 51:33.726
(Jim) It's magnificent.
(Mrs Whittaker) It's monstrous!

51:33.855 --> 51:38.212
It's me. I posed for a young Spaniard.
Don't you absolutely adore it?

51:38.335 --> 51:41.327
Very expressive, darling,
but I can't quite see you in it.

51:41.455 --> 51:42.934
(Mrs Whittaker) You can see
everything else!

51:43.055 --> 51:45.694
You took your clothes off
in front of a total stranger?

51:45.815 --> 51:49.524
Of course she took her clothes off.
- (Marion) I think it's unholy.

51:49.655 --> 51:54.934
I'm not sure I approve of you being nude.
You know, without... without me.

51:55.055 --> 51:56.454
Extraordinary.

51:57.575 --> 52:00.328
What exactly are you
hoping to achieve?

52:00.455 --> 52:03.128
Just trying to get into the swing
of things... Mother.

52:03.255 --> 52:08.852
Marvellous! Well, then, you'll be riding
in the hunt with us, won't you?

52:08.975 --> 52:11.887
I might be persuaded
if the painting stays.

52:12.015 --> 52:13.687
Hunt.
- Paint.

52:13.815 --> 52:15.487
Hunt.
- Paint.

52:15.615 --> 52:17.048
Hunt!

52:17.175 --> 52:18.767
Very well.

52:20.655 --> 52:22.088
Hunt.

52:27.655 --> 52:29.407
View, hello.

52:32.535 --> 52:36.084
Hello, everyone.
Good to see you. Richard.

52:36.215 --> 52:39.491
Morning, Jim!
After generations of false starts,

52:39.615 --> 52:42.129
we've finally managed
to combine our cavalry.

52:42.255 --> 52:44.849
Congratulations.
A marriage of minor convenience.

52:44.975 --> 52:46.727
You'll be fine, I promise.

52:46.855 --> 52:51.326
The second you have the Holborough
boy's eye, flirt outrageously.

52:51.455 --> 52:54.049
But Warwick Holborough has ears
like the Cambridge Cup!

52:54.175 --> 52:59.169
And Philip's the prize. Now, if you want
a man's attention... ignore him.

53:06.095 --> 53:09.212
(Philip) Warwick the Wingnut
and Sausage Fingers?

53:09.335 --> 53:13.408
What a handsome couple.
They'll have puppies not children.

53:15.295 --> 53:19.004
Wait... there's something I need to say.

53:20.095 --> 53:23.326
I see you... you're wasted here.

53:23.455 --> 53:27.130
When the time comes... give me a ring.

53:27.255 --> 53:30.088
If I could find your neck, I'd wring it.

53:30.215 --> 53:33.969
Larita's making sheep's eyes at Philip.
- She's a Venus de Flytrap!

53:34.095 --> 53:38.054
(Hilda) She wants him all to herself.
- She's not interested in Philip.

53:38.175 --> 53:40.450
Nobody's interested in Philip.
- (Hilda) I am!

53:41.375 --> 53:43.047
Mount up, Larita.

53:43.175 --> 53:46.929
If you don't mind, I think
I might give the fox a head start.

53:47.055 --> 53:49.853
Lari, get on the pony, please.

53:50.415 --> 53:52.485
Oh, it's just as I thought...

53:52.615 --> 53:55.925
Oh, I said I'd ride,
and I'm always good for my word.

53:56.895 --> 53:58.089
Tally-ho!

54:06.255 --> 54:08.371
(Cheering)

54:08.495 --> 54:10.884
(# 1920s version of "Sex Bomb")

54:13.375 --> 54:17.163
# Spy on me, baby, use satellite

54:17.295 --> 54:21.174
# Infrared to see me
move through the night

54:21.295 --> 54:24.651
# Aim, going to fire, shoot me right

54:24.775 --> 54:28.529
# I'm going to like the way you fight

54:28.655 --> 54:32.568
# Now you've found
the secret code I use

54:32.695 --> 54:36.370
# To wash away my lonely blues

54:36.495 --> 54:42.604
# So I can't deny or lie
cos you're the only one to make me fly

54:43.735 --> 54:47.853
# Sex bomb, sex bomb,
you're a sex bomb

54:47.975 --> 54:51.126
# You can give it to me
when I need to come along...

54:51.255 --> 54:53.564
(Engine revs)
- What?

54:53.695 --> 54:55.890
# You're my sex bomb... #

54:56.015 --> 54:59.212
What is she doing?
- A victory lap, by the look of things.

55:00.215 --> 55:03.605
There's something wild about that child
that's so contagious.

55:06.895 --> 55:08.965
Whoo-hoo!

55:12.055 --> 55:15.934
Well, she promised she'd ride.
Ha-ha!

55:24.815 --> 55:28.285
#... no chaperone
can get our number

55:28.415 --> 55:33.250
# The world's in a slumber,
let's misbehave!

55:33.375 --> 55:37.971
# There's something wild
about you, child, that's so contagious

55:38.095 --> 55:43.010
# Let's be outrageous,
let's misbehave!

55:43.135 --> 55:47.686
# When Adam won Eve's hand,
he wouldn't stand for teasin'

55:47.815 --> 55:52.445
# He didn't care about those apples
out of season

55:52.575 --> 55:57.285
# They say that Spring means
just one little thing to little lovebirds

55:57.415 --> 56:02.773
# We're not above birds,
let's misbehave... #

56:08.815 --> 56:10.328
(Larita) Whoo!

56:20.375 --> 56:22.935
Miss Hilda,
telephone from New York.

56:30.215 --> 56:31.648
Uncle George?

56:31.775 --> 56:34.528
Oh, thank God, a friendly voice.

56:34.655 --> 56:37.647
Yes, and she's a complete nightmare.

56:40.295 --> 56:42.206
Really?

56:42.335 --> 56:44.451
How salacious.

56:45.975 --> 56:46.612
(Knocking)

56:46.735 --> 56:48.532
(Mrs Whittaker) Come in.

56:49.415 --> 56:50.814
Mother?

56:52.135 --> 56:55.252
I'd like to apologise
for today's schmozzle.

56:55.375 --> 56:57.570
That really won't be necessary.

56:57.695 --> 57:00.732
Larita made no secret
of her disapproval of blood sports.

57:00.855 --> 57:02.368
She did ride as promised.

57:02.495 --> 57:07.728
Well, we should credit her with her
imaginative way of keeping her word.

57:07.855 --> 57:09.846
You must be very proud of her.

57:10.855 --> 57:13.323
Mother, I think...

57:13.455 --> 57:15.844
I think maybe Larita and I ought to go.

57:15.975 --> 57:18.091
Oh...

57:18.215 --> 57:20.729
Yes, I see. Very well.

57:20.855 --> 57:24.530
Feel free to drop in
whenever it takes your fancy.

57:24.655 --> 57:26.771
Off you go. Enjoy.
- Don't be like that.

57:26.895 --> 57:29.773
I'm sorry, dear,
wasn't Mummy being kind enough?

57:29.895 --> 57:32.284
Take these, they might get you
as far as Constantinople!

57:32.415 --> 57:34.975
And this... Casablanca.
- Mother, stop it!

57:35.095 --> 57:36.892
No. You stop it!

57:38.215 --> 57:40.206
Stop being so naïve!

57:46.815 --> 57:49.204
The money's gone, John.

57:49.335 --> 57:51.212
Nothing left.

57:51.335 --> 57:54.407
The only thing standing
between this family and bankruptcy

57:54.535 --> 57:56.924
are those surveyors in the back field.

57:58.615 --> 58:04.008
Lord Hurst is offering to buy 400 acres
to keep the bailiffs away.

58:05.535 --> 58:09.813
It's your legacy, John Whittaker...
and I'm selling it.

58:14.215 --> 58:18.686
I had no idea.
- No... No, you don't.

58:23.375 --> 58:27.414
You were supposed to take over
the estate, take your responsibilities.

58:27.535 --> 58:30.413
But you were unexpectedly
flagged down.

58:32.055 --> 58:35.013
I've been struggling for years
with a man who doesn't care,

58:35.135 --> 58:37.251
waiting for you to step up to the mark.

58:39.655 --> 58:42.647
No. You just go.

58:42.775 --> 58:46.006
Go to Algiers
with your racing car driver.

58:46.135 --> 58:48.695
I'm too tired to care any more!

58:50.775 --> 58:54.324
(Larita) It's not exactly surprising,
John. Look at the grounds.

58:54.455 --> 58:58.733
Your mother is being very practical.
- In what sense?

58:58.855 --> 59:02.086
You're not coming back.
Your father moved out decades ago.

59:02.215 --> 59:06.049
Philip's not going to marry Hilda.
Nobody's going to marry Marion.

59:06.175 --> 59:10.054
Subdividing the land and selling
to a neighbour is an elegant solution.

59:10.175 --> 59:11.767
Somewhat harsh.

59:13.215 --> 59:15.809
I've had my fair share
of selling off my past,

59:15.935 --> 59:19.894
and it is an auction of innocence
that's neither fun nor pretty,

59:20.015 --> 59:23.291
but it is realistic,
something your mother excels in.

59:23.415 --> 59:26.009
But it's my responsibility.

59:27.375 --> 59:30.412
Gracious, how can I have been so blind?

01:00:07.255 --> 01:00:10.531
(Woman) Oh, winter hydrangeas!
How do you do it?

01:00:10.655 --> 01:00:15.251
It's a controlled mixture of passion,
persistence and horse manure.

01:00:17.855 --> 01:00:21.131
I was hoping to catch a glimpse
of the new bride.

01:00:21.255 --> 01:00:24.611
Ah! John's wife has
very fickle allergies.

01:00:24.735 --> 01:00:29.172
Allergies to what?
- Flowers, Emma. Can you believe it?

01:00:29.295 --> 01:00:32.332
That is a strange choice of bed fellow
for this neck of the woods.

01:00:32.455 --> 01:00:35.652
You'll just have to make do
with John and Sarah.

01:00:35.775 --> 01:00:38.164
It'll be like old times.

01:00:38.295 --> 01:00:43.608
# When you're smiling,
the whole world smiles... #

01:00:45.215 --> 01:00:47.445
Why the big Panda eyes?

01:00:49.215 --> 01:00:51.888
I've often meant to ask you something,
but I hadn't the courage.

01:00:52.015 --> 01:00:54.006
Well, don't then.

01:00:54.135 --> 01:00:58.253
Did you think I behaved like a cad,
marrying Larita without telling you?

01:00:58.375 --> 01:01:00.286
No, of course not.

01:01:00.415 --> 01:01:03.930
You took the opportunity and married
for love. I respect you for it.

01:01:04.055 --> 01:01:07.286
If we'd have married it would've been
for friendship and convenience.

01:01:07.415 --> 01:01:09.451
Would it?
- Yes!

01:01:09.575 --> 01:01:11.964
We knew one another far too well.

01:01:12.095 --> 01:01:17.806
I want my marriage to be thrilling,
romantic, with passionate love letters.

01:01:17.935 --> 01:01:21.450
I could've written you love letters.
- Well, you didn't, did you?

01:01:21.575 --> 01:01:23.566
I did love you all the same.

01:01:24.895 --> 01:01:26.248
John, stop it.

01:01:35.015 --> 01:01:37.893
He's very different
from the man I met in France.

01:01:39.215 --> 01:01:43.527
The boy. The same, sweet boy.

01:01:47.335 --> 01:01:51.692
Is it true what she says?
Are you really selling off the land?

01:01:53.215 --> 01:01:56.810
To be perfectly honest,
I haven't the faintest idea.

01:01:59.175 --> 01:02:01.848
But it's your home, it's your community.

01:02:03.015 --> 01:02:04.812
Doesn't that matter?

01:02:04.935 --> 01:02:06.448
No.

01:02:08.175 --> 01:02:10.211
You're a dark horse.

01:02:12.695 --> 01:02:17.405
Have you noticed how few men
of my age there are in this village?

01:02:17.535 --> 01:02:20.527
Fourteen years ago,
we all took the King's shilling.

01:02:20.655 --> 01:02:23.328
We all signed up together.

01:02:23.455 --> 01:02:28.210
My brother, friends, staff...

01:02:29.615 --> 01:02:34.166
All hunkered down in the front row
of The Great War.

01:02:35.455 --> 01:02:38.891
I thought they kept majors
safely behind desks?

01:02:39.015 --> 01:02:41.210
Promotion for surviving.

01:02:42.975 --> 01:02:47.127
As captain, it was my job
to get them all out of the trenches.

01:02:47.255 --> 01:02:51.248
Within the first four minutes
of our first charge...

01:02:53.295 --> 01:02:55.365
...20,000 men died.

01:03:00.535 --> 01:03:02.844
In Thorverton, down the road here...

01:03:03.935 --> 01:03:06.290
...they were stationed in Morocco.

01:03:07.175 --> 01:03:09.564
Their captain bought them all home.

01:03:15.255 --> 01:03:18.133
I didn't bring a single man back.

01:03:18.935 --> 01:03:20.971
This whole village died.

01:03:21.895 --> 01:03:25.171
I think there's a glimmer
of life in you yet.

01:03:25.295 --> 01:03:29.925
Well, if there is, it has no time for
pet cemeteries and Japanese lanterns.

01:03:30.055 --> 01:03:33.365
Why did you come back?
- I had no choice.

01:03:36.735 --> 01:03:40.728
Bonjour, Madame.
Qu'est-ce que vous voulez?

01:03:41.975 --> 01:03:44.409
(Giggling and whispering)

01:03:49.255 --> 01:03:51.485
(Larita) 'She came for you? '

01:03:53.015 --> 01:03:54.368
Why the lie?

01:03:54.495 --> 01:03:57.885
She thought "wandering home"
sounded better.

01:04:00.415 --> 01:04:02.975
And to be perfectly frank,
I no longer cared.

01:04:04.695 --> 01:04:08.165
(# Gramophone plays "Pack Up
Your Troubles In Your Old Kit Bag")

01:04:08.295 --> 01:04:12.811
I hate new games. There are
too many balls, I can't sink anything.

01:04:12.935 --> 01:04:16.848
Sink some gin, Sausage Fingers!
- (Hilda) I never, ever win.

01:04:16.975 --> 01:04:18.886
Oh, well done!

01:04:24.775 --> 01:04:28.245
(Hilda) Stop sucking it. Come and help.
(Sarah) Come on, Pops.

01:04:28.375 --> 01:04:31.572
(Hurst) All right, Missie,
hold your horses.

01:04:31.695 --> 01:04:34.004
Right, clear the decks, puppies.

01:04:34.135 --> 01:04:35.887
May I?

01:04:42.935 --> 01:04:45.324
I was hoping to have a word.

01:04:45.455 --> 01:04:49.448
We're accentuating the positive today,
I don't have a mind for anything else.

01:04:49.575 --> 01:04:51.452
Of course... of course.

01:04:52.895 --> 01:04:55.455
I know you are
under considerable stress...

01:04:57.175 --> 01:04:58.972
Regarding what?

01:05:00.575 --> 01:05:03.851
Lord Hurst's kind offer
to buy into your property.

01:05:03.975 --> 01:05:07.809
The realtor I'm dealing with in London
also specialises in subdivision.

01:05:07.935 --> 01:05:12.247
Perhaps he could help negotiate
a premium price.

01:05:12.375 --> 01:05:15.765
Thank you, but really this is
of no concern of yours.

01:05:15.895 --> 01:05:19.968
Of course it's a concern. I am a member
of this family now and I'd like to help.

01:05:20.095 --> 01:05:23.132
And this is your interpretation
of "help", is it?

01:05:23.255 --> 01:05:26.486
Carving up our heritage and selling
it off to the highest bidder?

01:05:26.615 --> 01:05:29.083
Coming from a country no older
than the chair you are sitting in,

01:05:29.215 --> 01:05:31.171
it seems a very practical solution.

01:05:31.295 --> 01:05:33.809
Just forget the seven
generations of people

01:05:33.935 --> 01:05:37.530
who have devoted their entire lives
to farming this land.

01:05:37.655 --> 01:05:40.692
Get someone else to do it.
With a machine, no less.

01:05:41.695 --> 01:05:43.686
Who do you think you are?

01:05:44.855 --> 01:05:48.484
Swinging your wherewithal
like a cat on heat.

01:05:49.895 --> 01:05:53.251
If you really want to be
of assistance, Larita,

01:05:53.375 --> 01:05:55.843
I think you know what's required.

01:05:57.895 --> 01:05:59.851
Right...

01:05:59.975 --> 01:06:03.650
I think it's time an expert showed you
how this game is played.

01:06:03.775 --> 01:06:05.686
(Hurst) Watch it...

01:06:05.815 --> 01:06:07.214
Bravo!

01:06:08.575 --> 01:06:12.363
What a sportswoman, I must say.
Can you imagine? Fantastic!

01:06:14.455 --> 01:06:16.446
(John) 'Lari, you're confusing me.'

01:06:16.575 --> 01:06:19.453
(Lari) 'I'm feeling trapped.'
- 'I don't understand.'

01:06:19.575 --> 01:06:22.612
It's this house!
It has an air of doom hanging over it.

01:06:22.735 --> 01:06:25.727
And I can barely stand the weight
much longer.

01:06:31.175 --> 01:06:33.928
The answer is to go abroad again.

01:06:34.055 --> 01:06:38.446
Not yet. This is my life for now,
you know that.

01:06:38.575 --> 01:06:41.692
And what part do I play in it?
- Do you have to be so loud?

01:06:41.815 --> 01:06:44.488
Of course I do! I'm American.

01:06:44.615 --> 01:06:46.685
(John laughs)

01:06:50.015 --> 01:06:54.452
What is the use of bickering like this?
It doesn't lead anywhere.

01:06:54.575 --> 01:06:57.408
You never know.
It might lead to a natural end.

01:06:58.975 --> 01:07:01.011
Do you want it to?

01:07:02.095 --> 01:07:04.245
Do you?

01:07:04.375 --> 01:07:05.774
No!

01:07:06.575 --> 01:07:09.567
I just want some peace and quiet.

01:07:09.695 --> 01:07:12.368
(Larita) You're far too young
to make a remark like that.

01:07:12.495 --> 01:07:14.486
I can't help my age...

01:07:15.735 --> 01:07:17.566
...Grandma.

01:07:20.335 --> 01:07:25.648
Look, I'm sorry that I leave you alone
so much. Honestly, I'm sorry.

01:07:28.055 --> 01:07:31.411
Good. Then let's do something about it.

01:07:36.575 --> 01:07:38.930
Why are we driving so fast?

01:07:39.055 --> 01:07:41.046
The thrill of escape!

01:07:41.175 --> 01:07:42.972
(Laughter)

01:07:45.775 --> 01:07:49.051
(Hurst) You're looking very game today.
Fairest game in the land.

01:07:50.535 --> 01:07:52.127
A penny for your thoughts?

01:07:52.255 --> 01:07:54.849
It's more than pennies,
I'm afraid, Pinkie.

01:07:54.975 --> 01:07:57.330
I don't think I can afford the party
this year.

01:07:57.455 --> 01:07:59.969
But the Japanese lanterns!
- No, cancelled.

01:08:00.095 --> 01:08:02.848
Had to choose,
Japanese lanterns or the maid.

01:08:02.975 --> 01:08:08.003
You're not getting out of it that easily.
My offer of cellar and staff still stands.

01:08:08.135 --> 01:08:11.525
It wouldn't be Christmas
without your knees-up.

01:08:11.655 --> 01:08:12.804
(Gunshot)

01:08:19.615 --> 01:08:21.492
(She sighs heavily)

01:08:21.615 --> 01:08:26.894
Oh! This is the first piece of clarity
I've had since arriving. Whoo!

01:08:30.375 --> 01:08:33.890
Why can't we live in moments
like these forever?

01:08:34.015 --> 01:08:35.812
Why?

01:08:35.935 --> 01:08:39.166
Because you've stopped
loving me, my darling!

01:08:39.295 --> 01:08:41.251
How can you say that?

01:08:41.375 --> 01:08:44.252
Oh, I just open my mouth
and the words come out.

01:08:45.135 --> 01:08:47.251
Then let's make a fresh start.

01:09:02.015 --> 01:09:06.725
There are so many things I need
to tell you about me. Hard things.

01:09:06.854 --> 01:09:08.573
I don't care.

01:09:08.694 --> 01:09:10.492
I do.

01:09:10.615 --> 01:09:14.813
It doesn't matter.
I trust you absolutely.

01:09:15.255 --> 01:09:24.493
# I'll see you again
whenever Spring breaks through again...

01:09:24.615 --> 01:09:25.843
Come on.

01:09:26.654 --> 01:09:30.773
# Time may lie heavy between

01:09:31.575 --> 01:09:38.207
# But what has been
is past forgetting

01:09:38.335 --> 01:09:43.125
# This sweet memory

01:09:43.255 --> 01:09:49.444
# Throughout my life will come to me

01:09:49.575 --> 01:09:53.886
# Though the world may go awry... #

01:09:56.295 --> 01:09:57.489
(Man) Shot!

01:09:57.615 --> 01:09:59.765
(Barking)

01:10:01.135 --> 01:10:02.614
(Screams)

01:10:02.735 --> 01:10:04.407
(Laughing)

01:10:05.255 --> 01:10:06.654
(Gasps) John!

01:10:08.535 --> 01:10:10.048
(Dog snarls)

01:10:10.175 --> 01:10:13.372
Top hole.
- Oh!

01:10:13.495 --> 01:10:16.612
(Jim) I can't decide which is worse,
that you had to sneak outside

01:10:16.735 --> 01:10:19.408
to get some privacy,
or that you were caught by Veronica.

01:10:19.535 --> 01:10:21.287
(Larita) Who's Veronica?

01:10:21.415 --> 01:10:23.565
I am. It's my name.

01:10:23.695 --> 01:10:25.174
(Jim chuckles)

01:10:26.615 --> 01:10:29.971
I fail to see the humour in it!
- No, darling, you're quite right.

01:10:30.095 --> 01:10:33.326
I can certainly see the serious
implications. It's not a laughing matter.

01:10:33.455 --> 01:10:35.252
It's only a laughing matter.

01:10:35.375 --> 01:10:39.084
Indecent exposure is illegal.
Even in America.

01:10:39.215 --> 01:10:41.206
Yep, yep...

01:10:41.335 --> 01:10:43.803
You're right.
And we're very, very sorry, aren't we?

01:10:43.935 --> 01:10:48.053
No, I'm not. This is my husband.
- And this is my home!

01:10:48.175 --> 01:10:50.564
(Jim) Maybe it's time for them
to fly the nest?

01:10:50.695 --> 01:10:54.404
Certainly not. They will stay put
and brazen this out.

01:10:54.535 --> 01:10:57.413
And you can get that ghastly painting
out of my house!

01:10:57.535 --> 01:11:00.288
We do not need any more reminders
of your easy virtue!

01:11:01.215 --> 01:11:02.534
(Sighs heavily)

01:11:10.175 --> 01:11:12.609
Excited, Furber?
- Overwhelmed, sir.

01:11:12.735 --> 01:11:17.126
Miss Hilda...
- Uncle George... How explosive!

01:11:17.255 --> 01:11:19.849
Furber, I recognise that as asparagus.

01:11:19.975 --> 01:11:21.772
(Furber) Correct, Madam.

01:11:21.895 --> 01:11:25.331
Ha! I pity poor Panda.
- Oh, what is it now?

01:11:25.455 --> 01:11:30.404
Read! "The Detroit News".
Uncle George is a super sleuth!

01:11:30.535 --> 01:11:33.811
Collecting old newspapers is
the last refuge of a truly boring man.

01:11:33.935 --> 01:11:37.894
Boring? Far from it. It was a scandal!

01:11:38.015 --> 01:11:40.609
Wasn't it... Mrs Morley?

01:11:41.855 --> 01:11:44.847
Mrs Tom Morley of Detroit, Michigan.

01:11:44.975 --> 01:11:47.091
(Jim) Don't be grotesque, Hilda.

01:11:47.215 --> 01:11:51.527
Well, I suppose I'd better finish
my meal before it wilts entirely.

01:11:51.655 --> 01:11:54.010
(Jim) Any dressing?
- Oh, I am genuinely shocked!

01:11:54.135 --> 01:11:57.684
No thanks, I always end up wearing it.
- We've been hoodwinked!

01:11:57.815 --> 01:12:00.124
Especially that runny vinaigrette.
- (Marion) Fire and brimstone!

01:12:00.255 --> 01:12:02.132
Mayonnaise has more ballast.

01:12:02.255 --> 01:12:05.486
Will you stop this insulting behaviour
immediately?

01:12:11.015 --> 01:12:13.051
Oh, I always hated that photo of myself.

01:12:13.175 --> 01:12:17.088
(Mrs Whittaker) Of everything I ever
expected, nothing prepared me for this.

01:12:17.215 --> 01:12:19.775
(Jim) For what?
- She was charged with murder.

01:12:19.895 --> 01:12:22.284
I was acquitted.
- And that's consolation?

01:12:22.415 --> 01:12:25.725
I told you my husband died.
- But you didn't tell us how, did you?

01:12:25.855 --> 01:12:27.766
Does John know about this?

01:12:27.895 --> 01:12:30.125
(Hilda) I see...
- It's no concern of ours.

01:12:30.255 --> 01:12:32.769
Father! Really!

01:12:32.895 --> 01:12:35.648
Yes, and after Hilda went
to all that trouble digging it up.

01:12:35.775 --> 01:12:38.130
I'm going outside for a cigarette.
Care to join me?

01:12:38.255 --> 01:12:41.053
Thank you, Jim. Don't mind if I do.

01:12:42.735 --> 01:12:44.373
No concern?

01:12:49.495 --> 01:12:51.486
(Jim) The pack's closing.

01:12:51.615 --> 01:12:54.652
This woman has taken advantage
of our son!

01:12:54.775 --> 01:12:56.731
He'd never have married her
if he'd known.

01:12:56.855 --> 01:12:59.608
You know that, do you?
- You'd have preferred we had an affair?

01:12:59.735 --> 01:13:02.693
It would've been more appropriate!
- Mother!

01:13:02.815 --> 01:13:06.728
Unfortunately, I agree with you!
- (Marion) It's easy to talk like this now.

01:13:06.855 --> 01:13:10.768
It isn't easy, it's heartbreaking.
I love John, but it's not blind love.

01:13:10.895 --> 01:13:12.089
(Marion snorts)

01:13:12.215 --> 01:13:15.048
Marion, does that sound
indicate contempt or asthma?

01:13:15.175 --> 01:13:17.405
You can't palm us off like that,
Mrs Morley.

01:13:17.535 --> 01:13:19.526
(Jim) This is your doing.
You're a bigger fool than you look.

01:13:19.655 --> 01:13:21.646
(Hilda) Larita is your type,
isn't she, Father?

01:13:21.775 --> 01:13:24.209
(Larita) That is the nicest thing
any of you have ever said.

01:13:24.335 --> 01:13:26.769
(John) Hello, are we having a picnic?

01:13:28.375 --> 01:13:33.813
John... I think your wife better unveil
this one herself. Don't you, Larita?

01:13:37.375 --> 01:13:38.854
Before we met...

01:13:39.895 --> 01:13:43.854
...I was involved in a court case
over the death of my husband.

01:13:43.975 --> 01:13:46.205
It was seedy and stressful,

01:13:46.335 --> 01:13:49.133
but since I was found innocent

01:13:49.255 --> 01:13:52.247
I didn't think it necessary
to burden you with the details.

01:13:52.375 --> 01:13:53.603
Innocent?

01:13:53.735 --> 01:13:56.533
She was responsible
for a man killing himself!

01:13:56.655 --> 01:14:00.125
The verdict was suicide
but that's not where it started.

01:14:00.255 --> 01:14:01.973
I thought it was cancer.

01:14:02.615 --> 01:14:04.173
It was...

01:14:04.295 --> 01:14:06.729
But he was so desperately sick.

01:14:06.855 --> 01:14:09.927
If you'd known him, you would've
understood how forgivable it was.

01:14:10.055 --> 01:14:12.410
It's not as if she poisoned him.
- That's what everyone thinks.

01:14:12.535 --> 01:14:14.844
(Marion) She's a black widow.
- I pity you, Marion.

01:14:14.975 --> 01:14:17.091
Really? Well, I won't let you!

01:14:17.215 --> 01:14:21.413
Right, that's it! You have a dance
to organise, I suggest you all get to it!

01:14:21.535 --> 01:14:23.127
Now!

01:14:23.255 --> 01:14:24.927
(Marion whimpers)

01:14:26.895 --> 01:14:29.363
(Mrs Whittaker) Hilda! Come on, inside!

01:14:31.615 --> 01:14:33.367
(Jim) John...

(Larita sobs)

01:14:57.775 --> 01:15:00.767
Are you crying
because you're angry or ashamed?

01:15:00.895 --> 01:15:02.692
(Larita sighs)

01:15:02.815 --> 01:15:04.248
Neither.

01:15:05.855 --> 01:15:10.133
Coming here has been the most
demoralising experience of my life.

01:15:15.135 --> 01:15:18.093
Why didn't you tell me?

01:15:18.215 --> 01:15:20.649
I wanted to,
everything just happened so fast.

01:15:20.775 --> 01:15:22.845
That's not good enough.

01:15:24.135 --> 01:15:26.888
I tried to, several times.

01:15:28.615 --> 01:15:32.369
But you trusted me..."absolutely".

01:15:34.295 --> 01:15:38.083
And you saw the field day
those fatuous hypocrites made of it.

01:15:38.215 --> 01:15:40.126
Please remember they're my family.

01:15:40.255 --> 01:15:42.723
I shouldn't think of them at all
if they weren't.

01:15:42.855 --> 01:15:47.007
Still... you should have told me.

01:15:48.535 --> 01:15:50.526
You should have loved me more.

01:15:52.535 --> 01:15:54.605
I couldn't love you any more.

01:15:54.735 --> 01:15:57.203
You should have loved me better.

01:16:00.215 --> 01:16:02.410
I don't understand you, Larita.

01:16:04.415 --> 01:16:06.849
I don't understand you at all.

01:16:09.935 --> 01:16:12.051

Dancing with you
is like trying to move a piano.

01:16:35.735 --> 01:16:38.010
I wonder what the American
will be wearing.

01:16:38.135 --> 01:16:40.285
Or who she'll be poisoning!

01:16:42.975 --> 01:16:46.251

Only when taken by people
who annoy me.

You've got me all to yourself.
Larita's upstairs with a headache.

01:16:52.935 --> 01:16:56.132

gave her that?

It's been a very trying day
for her, John.

01:17:19.855 --> 01:17:22.733
Go and escort your wife down.
- No, I wouldn't worry.

01:17:22.855 --> 01:17:26.484

an entrance when she's ready.

Why are you sitting in the dark?

01:17:48.815 --> 01:17:50.692
Watching.

01:18:01.535 --> 01:18:05.528
It seems they are universally similar
when their guard is up, as well.

May I?

01:18:11.815 --> 01:18:15.933
Thank you for being gallant today.
- You are damn cool in a crisis.

01:18:17.295 --> 01:18:20.367
The judge at my trial
said something similar.

01:18:22.455 --> 01:18:24.525
Why did you do it?

01:18:26.975 --> 01:18:29.330
Why did you marry John?

01:18:30.815 --> 01:18:34.330
My first husband was older,
and his end was messy.

01:18:36.295 --> 01:18:38.411
Long afterwards, this...

01:18:39.975 --> 01:18:41.249
...boy...

01:18:41.375 --> 01:18:46.324
...this pure boy arrived
fresh and unblemished.

01:18:49.415 --> 01:18:52.691
I married him because
any other relationship seemed...

01:18:53.535 --> 01:18:56.208
...cheap and squalid.

01:18:57.935 --> 01:19:02.247
My first marriage cost me my youth,
and here I am stealing someone else's.

01:19:04.215 --> 01:19:05.807
What will you do?

01:19:07.815 --> 01:19:09.931
The best I can.

(Mrs Whittaker) Oh, Davis, thank you.

01:19:18.655 --> 01:19:21.692
And thank you, Pinkie.
- No, not at all, my dear.

- Hmm...

to do it for themselves.
