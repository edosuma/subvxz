00:02.035 --> 00:03.627
<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill:

00:03.703 --> 00:04.965
I'm glad you came, son.

00:05.038 --> 00:07.666
I want to do something
I should have done a long time ago.

00:07.741 --> 00:10.437
-I went to go see Dan.
-What did he say this time?

00:10.510 --> 00:11.875
That he was sorry.

00:11.945 --> 00:13.879
Before the proposal
we were friends, Keith.

00:13.947 --> 00:17.007
I mean, can't we at least try
to go back to the way we were then?

00:17.083 --> 00:18.243
I don't think so.

00:18.318 --> 00:20.548
My doctor's putting me
through cardiovascular rehab.

00:20.620 --> 00:24.021
-I thought you might like to join me.
-So you want to be workout buddies?

00:24.090 --> 00:27.082
Be a good chance
to spend time together, get to know you.

00:27.160 --> 00:28.684
You had my whole life to do that.

00:28.762 --> 00:30.423
I thought the divorce went through.

00:30.497 --> 00:34.900
Technically, no. Dan had the heart attack
before signing the papers.

00:34.968 --> 00:38.096
While signing the papers, actually.

00:38.471 --> 00:42.737
Look, would you do me a favor
and put a copy of this in the lockbox...

00:42.809 --> 00:44.800
in my bottom desk drawer?

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074

00:54.854 --> 00:56.981
You are the one that I want.

00:57.190 --> 00:58.782
Yeah, me, too.

02:10.263 --> 02:11.628
Excuse me.

02:13.399 --> 02:14.593
Hello.

02:20.807 --> 02:23.742
<i>Hola.</i>

02:24.777 --> 02:28.076
Okay, look, I don't know
what my mom told you...

02:28.515 --> 02:32.383
but here's the drill.
Pool boys don't get swimming privileges.

02:33.453 --> 02:34.750
<i>Lo siento.</i>

02:35.555 --> 02:37.853
Right. I <i>siento</i> you, too.

02:39.292 --> 02:41.658
Get-ay out-ay.

02:53.473 --> 02:55.407
What, you lose your suit?

02:55.842 --> 02:57.207
<i>Yo no uso eso.</i>

02:59.112 --> 03:02.343
I ditched Spanish
the day they covered the naked verbs.

03:02.982 --> 03:07.214
You no swim here.

03:07.654 --> 03:10.555
-Okay?
-Okay.

03:12.091 --> 03:13.683
<i>Por ahi te veo.</i>

03:18.765 --> 03:22.826
<i>Every night I watch you sleep</i>

03:23.303 --> 03:26.670
<i>Peace in dreams I hope you'll keep</i>

03:26.973 --> 03:31.535
<i>Until your death, with your last breath</i>

03:31.744 --> 03:33.371
<i>Breath....</i>

03:34.380 --> 03:37.406
Are you writing a song
or are you planning on killing me?

03:37.483 --> 03:41.283
Officially, I'm writing a new song.
Unofficially, I'd watch your back.

03:41.621 --> 03:45.523
By the way I found a new car
on the internet. It's great.

03:45.858 --> 03:48.486
-Define ''great.''
-$500 great.

03:48.561 --> 03:51.359
Which is actually $36 less
than we've got in the Wish Dish...

03:51.431 --> 03:53.922
so we can probably spring
for a full tank of gas.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.231
My wish was more along the lines of Tivo,
surround sound.

03:57.303 --> 04:00.704
A car will get you off the bus
before Keith fires you for being late.

04:00.773 --> 04:03.936
Will you take a look at it?
If it's a piece of junk we'll keep looking.

04:04.010 --> 04:05.272
-Deal?
-Deal.

04:05.678 --> 04:09.045
And make sure the trunk's big enough
to fit your body.

04:10.316 --> 04:11.783
Just in case.

04:17.857 --> 04:20.620
Dan? Are you okay?

04:21.560 --> 04:25.019
Yeah. I'm gonna order some lawn gnomes.

04:25.765 --> 04:27.460
The front yard looks a little bare.

04:27.700 --> 04:29.759
It's a nice day. You want to try a walk?

04:30.637 --> 04:32.070
Maybe later.

04:40.980 --> 04:43.210
Peyton, you looking for Lucas?

04:44.717 --> 04:48.346
Actually, I was looking for you.
I just wanted to say...

04:48.421 --> 04:51.857
I'm sorry things didn't work out
between you and my dad.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.817
I was really enjoying getting to know you.

04:54.894 --> 04:56.623
Yeah, I liked that, too.

04:57.230 --> 04:59.994
So, I was hoping
maybe we could keep in touch.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.498
Unless that's weird.

05:01.868 --> 05:03.995
No. It wouldn't be weird at all.

05:04.070 --> 05:05.731
Okay. Great.

05:06.205 --> 05:08.366
Can I ask you for some advice?

05:08.441 --> 05:10.739
You're the only woman I know
that runs a business...

05:10.810 --> 05:12.937
and I've got this crazy idea.

05:13.012 --> 05:15.344
I like crazy ideas. What is it?

05:15.648 --> 05:19.448
Okay. It is impossible
to see good live music in this town...

05:19.519 --> 05:21.612
without a fake ID, so I went to <i>thud...</i>

05:21.688 --> 05:23.986
and I suggested they sponsor
an all-ages night.

05:24.057 --> 05:27.584
You know, not like here at the cafe,
but, like a club night.

05:27.694 --> 05:29.025
That sounds great.

05:29.095 --> 05:31.859
Yeah, I thought so, too,
but no takers so far.

05:31.931 --> 05:35.765
Club managers find out I'm in high school
and it kind of ends there.

05:35.868 --> 05:38.393
It only takes one person
to say yes, Peyton.

05:38.705 --> 05:42.971
If you believe in it, see it through.
Eventually someone else will see it, too.

05:53.553 --> 05:55.953
Hey, Dad. How's it going?

05:56.022 --> 05:58.650
''Pretty good, son.
You know, I'm proud of you.

05:58.725 --> 06:00.386
''How's Haley?''

06:02.862 --> 06:05.160
Well, at least the cardboard one's polite.

06:05.231 --> 06:08.064
Nathan, you're not gonna be
detailing cars forever.

06:08.134 --> 06:10.159
I'm gonna find you something,
you know, better.

06:10.236 --> 06:12.864
No. It's cool. Whatever I have to do.

06:12.939 --> 06:15.601
Just treat me like any other employee
who has no skills...

06:15.675 --> 06:17.700
and whose last name isn't Scott.

06:17.910 --> 06:19.343
Okay, I will.

06:20.880 --> 06:24.145
Keith, I have a favor to ask.

06:24.884 --> 06:27.546
See, now you are like any other employee.

06:28.421 --> 06:31.720
Me and Haley have been saving up
for a used car, and...

06:31.791 --> 06:35.249
well, she found one she likes,
but I don't know anything about cars.

06:35.328 --> 06:38.491
So, I was wondering if you could
check one out with me tomorrow.

06:38.564 --> 06:39.826
I'd be happy to.

06:39.899 --> 06:43.892
As long at you don't spread that
''I don't know anything about cars'' here.

06:44.337 --> 06:46.897
Look, I know this isn't exactly glamorous...

06:47.006 --> 06:50.305
but you're doing a good job.
I'm glad you're here.

06:51.310 --> 06:53.244
It's nice to be around family.

06:55.982 --> 06:59.645
-Which one you got going here, Bobby?
-Just about done.

07:04.524 --> 07:07.357
-AII right, I'm gonna take off.
-Nathan.

07:09.028 --> 07:13.260
-Sorry. Force of habit. Lucas.
-It's okay.

07:14.100 --> 07:17.866
Actually, that reminds me.
I left my history book in the kitchen.

07:19.205 --> 07:23.141
-I'm gonna be late for school, first day.
-You're gonna do great.

07:24.644 --> 07:26.168
You sure you're gonna be okay here?

07:26.245 --> 07:28.736
If Dan needs you,
I can get Lucas in after school.

07:28.815 --> 07:33.047
No, it's fine.
I don't think I'm what Dan needs, anyway.

07:33.719 --> 07:37.155
-What do you mean?
-He's withdrawn, he's depressed.

07:37.256 --> 07:41.022
The doctor did say mood swings were
pretty common after a heart attack, right?

07:41.093 --> 07:44.392
Well, it's more than that.
He just sits around watching TV.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.262
He won't do his rehab. I can't reach him.

07:47.533 --> 07:51.128
And without Nathan around,
I don't know who can.

07:51.604 --> 07:53.799
-Well, see you.
-Okay. Bye.

07:58.945 --> 08:02.210
-Lucas.
-Your door was open.

08:02.648 --> 08:04.172
You want to have a seat?

08:04.250 --> 08:07.014
Actually, I was wondering
if you wanted to go out.

08:09.255 --> 08:11.189
No, thanks. I'm not really up for it today.

08:11.257 --> 08:13.487
Listen, you said you wanted
to rehab together.

08:13.559 --> 08:15.493
-Here I am.
-Well, maybe later.

08:16.696 --> 08:19.187
Today only. Take it or leave it.

08:25.238 --> 08:28.230
-You think you can make it to the corner?
-Of course.

08:29.308 --> 08:31.674
You been shooting around at all?

08:31.944 --> 08:35.380
Some. You know, this isn't a race.
We can slow down if you want.

08:35.448 --> 08:37.211
Easy for you to say.

08:38.317 --> 08:40.945
-What is that supposed to mean?
-Nothing.

08:42.421 --> 08:44.616
It's hard to be less
than what you once were.

08:44.690 --> 08:46.624
You might not understand that.

08:46.859 --> 08:48.224
Yeah, I do.

08:48.828 --> 08:52.992
I'm not sure I'll ever play basketball
at the same level ever again.

08:53.266 --> 08:55.063
I think about it every day.

08:56.736 --> 08:59.296
-Nathan doing okay?
-You really want to know?

08:59.438 --> 09:02.805
Yeah, I do.
After all that's happened, he's still my son.

09:03.809 --> 09:06.243
He's good.
You know, he and Haley are happy.

09:06.312 --> 09:08.405
He really likes it at the dealership.

09:08.481 --> 09:11.177
-My dealership?
-Yeah...

09:11.951 --> 09:14.579
Keith took him on. I thought you knew.

09:16.255 --> 09:19.019
-We're done here.
-Come on. It's not that far to the corner.

09:19.091 --> 09:21.559
I said I'm done. My health, my call.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.657
Okay.

09:23.996 --> 09:28.023
-Let me at least take you to the house.
-Lucas, go to school.

09:34.106 --> 09:37.234
So. Business 101? You a business major?

09:37.610 --> 09:40.670
I'm not sure yet. It's my first college class.

09:41.447 --> 09:44.382
And you're taking it with Hargrove?
This guy's tough.

09:44.450 --> 09:45.678
Really?

09:46.719 --> 09:48.084
How tough?

09:48.421 --> 09:51.822
I hear he shot a guy in B-school,
just to watch him die.

09:53.225 --> 09:54.920
-You're kidding.
-Yes.

09:56.896 --> 10:00.593
Well, about him shooting someone.
Not about him being tough, though.

10:03.202 --> 10:04.464
Good luck.

10:11.177 --> 10:14.374
Morning, folks.
My name is Andy Hargrove.

10:14.847 --> 10:16.314
Welcome to my class.

10:16.482 --> 10:19.849
When I was 21, I made my first million
with a B2B search engine.

10:19.919 --> 10:23.150
The next year I tripled it.
And then I tripled that.

10:23.222 --> 10:26.919
Did an IPO, got really rich, cashed out,
and wound up here.

10:27.126 --> 10:29.822
There was a couple of hangovers,
and this side-trip to Nepal...

10:29.895 --> 10:33.228
between there and here,
but that's not important right now.

10:33.599 --> 10:34.725
Okay.

10:36.068 --> 10:38.229
Let's talk about...

10:40.673 --> 10:41.662
greed.

10:42.174 --> 10:44.142
Can't run a business without it.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.039
Anyone disagree with me?

10:48.514 --> 10:50.539
There's one in every class. Okay.

10:50.616 --> 10:53.414
-So, what's your name?
-Karen.

10:53.519 --> 10:56.181
And granted, I run a small cafe...

10:56.489 --> 10:59.515
but I've found that if you treat people well
they come back.

10:59.592 --> 11:03.119
If you price things fairly,
if you make a quality product...

11:03.262 --> 11:06.356
you don't have to be ruthless
to be successful.

11:09.001 --> 11:12.334
Does anyone agree with her?

11:16.442 --> 11:19.843
Well, that's too bad, 'cause she's right.
Guys, look...

11:20.212 --> 11:22.874
I know that this class
is titled Business 101...

11:22.948 --> 11:25.439
but I like to think of it as Zen Business.

11:25.885 --> 11:27.910
Who here wants to do well?

11:29.755 --> 11:31.086
Everybody.

11:32.358 --> 11:34.155
Who here wants to do good?

11:35.861 --> 11:38.625
Because there's absolutely no reason
why you can't do both.

11:38.698 --> 11:42.498
And since I'm the teacher,
let's presume I'm right about that for now.

11:44.303 --> 11:48.103
AII right, everybody flunks today's lesson.
Except for Karen.

12:04.857 --> 12:07.985
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, unless we're both dead.

12:09.295 --> 12:11.195
Buddy, that's my spot.

12:13.466 --> 12:16.026
What are you doing here?
You're the pool boy.

12:16.335 --> 12:19.498
You no park here.

12:22.374 --> 12:27.004
-Do you know this guy?
-No. I've just seen him naked.

12:42.728 --> 12:46.061
-Pool boy. Wait up.
-Running and gunning, baby.

12:46.132 --> 12:48.464
-You've got to keep up with me.
-You speak English.

12:48.534 --> 12:51.332
We wouldn't get very far
if you kept trying to speak Spanish.

12:51.403 --> 12:53.564
Who the hell are you, anyway?

12:54.774 --> 12:58.335
Buddy, these are $200 shoes.
Don't make me speed walk.

12:58.611 --> 13:01.512
I'm your new neighbor.
Which makes you the girl next door.

13:01.580 --> 13:03.411
And, in the movie, she was a porn star.

13:03.482 --> 13:05.916
I don't believe you
because if you were my neighbor...

13:05.985 --> 13:09.318
-you'd know that house has its own pool.
-I like yours better.

13:09.388 --> 13:12.846
-This thing between us, it's inevitable.
-What thing?

13:12.925 --> 13:15.689
-There is no thing.
-Come on. We fight, we flirt...

13:15.761 --> 13:18.889
maybe you even slap me, but eventually
we end up in the sack together.

13:18.964 --> 13:21.159
How about we skip the anger,
cut right to the sex?

13:21.233 --> 13:23.531
-How about we cut right to the slap?
-Okay.

13:23.602 --> 13:27.436
-If it's part of the sex.
-Brooke. Who's your friend?

13:27.506 --> 13:31.738
-He's no friend of mine.
-Girl, I love it when you're sassy!

13:34.180 --> 13:36.740
How you doing, man?
I'm Felix. The new guy.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.148
I'm Mouth. The been-here-forever-guy.

13:39.218 --> 13:42.244
Right. So, tell me something, man.
How's the talent around here?

13:42.321 --> 13:43.345
Sports?

13:43.422 --> 13:46.585
Keep up with me, Mouth. Women.
The girls. How's the stock?

13:46.659 --> 13:48.923
Are they all like your friend Brooke?

13:49.795 --> 13:52.320
-I don't really--
-You don't know. That's okay.

13:52.398 --> 13:54.696
I need someone to show me around.
You up for that?

13:54.767 --> 13:57.759
-Sure, guess so.
-Great. Look, here's the thing.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.305
We're gonna roll strong.
We're not gonna hurt anyone...

14:00.372 --> 14:03.830
but we'll break a few hearts. It happens.
They live, you learn.

14:04.143 --> 14:07.306
Occupational hazard.
AII right. Who do you like that's available?

14:07.379 --> 14:11.679
-Who do I like?
-For me, Mouth. Don't be selfish.

14:15.621 --> 14:17.282
How about her?

14:20.526 --> 14:21.891
No, too young.

14:21.994 --> 14:25.589
You want to hit it, not babysit it.
Look, on top of that, I'm the new guy.

14:25.664 --> 14:29.100
I mean, my game is strong anyway,
but new guy status is hardcore.

14:29.168 --> 14:31.693
Peyton, Haley. This is Felix.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.429
-Hi.
-How you doing?

14:33.505 --> 14:37.066
-Hi, nice to meet you.
-Girl, you are totally fine.

14:37.376 --> 14:39.503
Dude, I am totally married.

14:39.612 --> 14:41.603
Really? Who's the father?

14:42.248 --> 14:44.045
A little close, aren't you?

14:44.149 --> 14:45.810
I guess it's you.

14:48.821 --> 14:51.085
She's not pregnant, but they are married.

14:51.156 --> 14:54.216
Yeah, I saw the ring.
Guess she likes poor guys.

14:58.230 --> 15:00.892
-This should be interesting.
-Yeah.

15:01.267 --> 15:03.758
<i>So, I showed him around</i>
<i>and he seems pretty cool.</i>

15:03.836 --> 15:06.396
His family, they move, like,
almost every year.

15:06.472 --> 15:09.373
-Witness protection?
-Doctors Without Borders.

15:09.475 --> 15:10.840
They've been all over the world.

15:10.910 --> 15:13.344
His parents are opening up
a private practice here.

15:13.412 --> 15:16.404
-Who are we talking about?
-Felix. The new guy.

15:16.582 --> 15:20.143
-You met him?
-Sort of. He was hitting on Haley.

15:20.486 --> 15:22.647
I thought you weren't
supposed to be playing.

15:22.721 --> 15:25.622
Look, a little pick-up now and then
ain't gonna kill me.

15:25.691 --> 15:27.158
You want a run?

15:28.294 --> 15:31.491
I was on my way home.
I've got a ton of studying to do...

15:31.563 --> 15:33.963
and I've got to work tomorrow. One shot.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.097
Yes.

15:36.702 --> 15:39.262
How's work anyway?
The boss not riding you too hard?

15:39.338 --> 15:42.899
No, man. Keith's cool.
A lot cooler than my dad ever was.

15:43.642 --> 15:47.635
It's kind of weird how my closest contact
with him now is a cardboard cutout.

15:47.713 --> 15:49.146
Yeah, listen...

15:49.214 --> 15:52.206
I may have screwed things up
for you with Dan.

15:52.651 --> 15:56.644
He asked about you
and I kind of mentioned the dealership gig.

15:57.656 --> 15:58.680
But you talked to him.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.152
Yeah.

16:01.093 --> 16:03.857
Look, your mom's having trouble
getting him to rehab.

16:03.929 --> 16:07.888
So I figured, maybe I'd give it a shot.
If that's cool with you.

16:08.133 --> 16:09.293
Honestly?

16:09.601 --> 16:13.901
After everything you know about the guy,
are you sure you want to let him in?

16:14.740 --> 16:17.004
When Dan had his heart attack...

16:17.977 --> 16:21.811
I figured, well, that's it.
We're never gonna know each other.

16:22.047 --> 16:24.538
But he didn't die.

16:25.851 --> 16:29.252
So, it kind of makes me wonder
if I don't take a chance now...

16:30.189 --> 16:32.180
will I regret it someday?

16:32.491 --> 16:36.894
You do what you need to do, man.
You should know who he is.

16:38.430 --> 16:39.727
I want you to fire Nathan.

16:39.798 --> 16:42.995
The name over the front door
still says Dan Scott Motors.

16:43.068 --> 16:46.595
As long as I'm running things,
I make hiring decisions as I see fit.

16:46.672 --> 16:49.732
You know, word is you've actually got
a heart in your chest, Dan.

16:49.808 --> 16:52.436
-Why don't you try thinking of Nathan?
-You know, Keith...

16:52.511 --> 16:54.809
if Nathan can support a wife
he'll never realize...

16:54.880 --> 16:56.541
what a colossal mistake this marriage is.

16:56.615 --> 16:58.446
He's emancipated, Dan.

16:59.451 --> 17:02.511
That's his mistake to make.
And if you want him fired...

17:02.588 --> 17:04.954
you have to look him in the eye
and do it yourself...

17:05.023 --> 17:09.050
when you come back to work.
Until then, he stays.

17:14.133 --> 17:17.261
It's all attitude, Mouth.
Just gotta work with the vibe you've got.

17:17.336 --> 17:19.770
Geeky and shy are not a vibe.

17:19.838 --> 17:22.829
Packaging, my man.
You're not geeky, you're sensitive.

17:22.907 --> 17:27.538
You're not shy, you're mysterious.
Girls love that.

17:29.281 --> 17:32.114
Anybody special
you're looking to impress?

17:34.386 --> 17:35.375
Bye.

17:35.687 --> 17:39.316
No, I'm just, you know,
I'm playing the field.

17:39.792 --> 17:42.226
-What's up, Mouth?
-Hey, Luke.

17:43.429 --> 17:45.226
Run anybody over today?

17:45.330 --> 17:48.390
I feel you, man.
It's hard when the big dog comes to town.

17:48.467 --> 17:52.062
You're not sure where you stand anymore.
I get that. Hang tough, bro.

17:52.137 --> 17:53.900
It gets easier.

17:58.777 --> 18:00.074
Still mad?

18:00.512 --> 18:01.945
Still here?

18:07.019 --> 18:08.953
So what happened
between you and Brooke?

18:09.021 --> 18:12.513
Or was it Peyton?
Tell me it was both at the same time.

18:13.725 --> 18:17.923
Dude, I never said a word, I swear.
He's got, like, psychic super-powers.

18:18.197 --> 18:21.223
No, I've just been in eight schools
in the past 10 years.

18:21.300 --> 18:24.997
You learn how to read people.
So, Brooke? Peyton?

18:25.237 --> 18:28.832
-We're all just friends.
-If that's your story.

18:35.380 --> 18:37.109
I'll see you later.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.491
-How much do you love me?
-Did we get the car?

18:48.560 --> 18:50.755
-Close your eyes.
-Is the car in our apartment?

18:50.829 --> 18:52.194
Haley, come on.

18:52.264 --> 18:54.494
AII right. I'm closing my eyes.

18:54.566 --> 18:57.729
Come here. Wait a second.

18:57.803 --> 19:00.863
AII right, open. Do you love it?

19:07.312 --> 19:10.145
-What did you do?
-Now you have something to compose on.

19:10.215 --> 19:12.149
You were going with Keith
to look for a car.

19:12.217 --> 19:15.209
Yeah, we did.
But Keith said it was no good, so....

19:21.026 --> 19:22.015
Nathan...

19:22.594 --> 19:24.721
you have to take this back.

19:30.669 --> 19:31.897
You don't like it?

19:31.970 --> 19:36.805
Of course I like it. It's beautiful.
But we need a car.

19:36.975 --> 19:40.934
-Haley, we can get a car anytime.
-With what? Magic beans?

19:42.981 --> 19:46.417
Look, I know that you've never had
to deal with money before.

19:46.618 --> 19:49.382
But things are different now.
You can't just go out...

19:49.454 --> 19:53.151
and buy a keyboard because
you feel like it. We agreed on a car.

19:53.258 --> 19:55.920
Haley, you are a really good musician,
okay.

19:55.994 --> 19:58.861
I have a feeling about your music.
It's gonna take you places.

19:58.931 --> 20:01.422
That means a lot to me, Nathan. It does.

20:01.500 --> 20:04.094
But what is gonna take you to work?

20:04.169 --> 20:07.969
Right, fine. I was just trying
to do something nice for you, okay?

20:08.040 --> 20:10.531
Fine.
You want to do something nice for me?

20:10.642 --> 20:13.076
Get us a car like we talked about.

20:17.983 --> 20:22.716
It's a beautiful gift, but we worked so hard
to save that money.

20:22.788 --> 20:24.278
Hales, boys are clueless.

20:24.356 --> 20:26.916
I swear, I'm 30 years away
from giving them up for good.

20:26.992 --> 20:29.756
Okay, so, what about this? Does this say...

20:29.828 --> 20:31.819
''Let me promote an all-ages club night''?

20:31.897 --> 20:35.799
No. Not enough skin. Try this.

20:42.441 --> 20:45.672
God. That much for two doilies
and a piece of wire?

20:46.912 --> 20:50.143
-You're not gonna try it on?
-Not today.

20:50.282 --> 20:53.046
Not today?
Brooke Davis, this is a shopping day...

20:53.118 --> 20:55.279
you will never ever get back again.

20:55.387 --> 20:58.550
If you're still waiting on your ATM card,
I can front you the cash.

20:58.624 --> 21:02.890
No, that's cool. My dad just spaced
a deposit to my account.

21:02.961 --> 21:04.121
Okay.

21:07.299 --> 21:08.926
Now we're talking.

21:09.001 --> 21:11.663
If this band manager's a guy,
you are golden.

21:11.737 --> 21:15.503
Speaking of guys, can we just do
five minutes on this Felix person?

21:15.607 --> 21:17.370
Yes. He is hot.

21:17.442 --> 21:22.311
And totally vibing on you, married girl.
No wonder Nathan's jealous.

21:22.481 --> 21:25.917
It's kind of weird. I've never had
anything like that happen before.

21:25.984 --> 21:28.544
Okay, look, guys,
how could he make Nathan jealous?

21:28.620 --> 21:31.453
This boy is repellent.
He's been here, what, five seconds...

21:31.523 --> 21:33.923
and he's already butting in
everybody else's business...

21:33.992 --> 21:36.552
bossing people around
and acting like he owns the place.

21:36.628 --> 21:37.788
Come on.

21:39.031 --> 21:43.297
-What?
-Earth to Brooke. He's you in pants.

21:43.568 --> 21:45.195
He is not.

21:45.871 --> 21:49.363
-He kinda is.
-I hate you both!

21:57.783 --> 22:02.220
-Any verdict on college yet?
-My teacher's a little unorthodox.

22:02.421 --> 22:04.514
And younger than I expected.

22:05.357 --> 22:08.554
So you're one of these maturity-likers.

22:09.961 --> 22:12.054
Sorry, I suck at grammar.

22:13.432 --> 22:15.957
So, why did you pick me out of the class?

22:16.401 --> 22:18.995
Do you always find somebody to torment?

22:19.271 --> 22:22.399
I like to find the student
who can give me a run for my money.

22:22.474 --> 22:25.602
Which is a lot of money,
if my Google search is correct.

22:26.244 --> 22:27.609
Yeah, it is.

22:27.679 --> 22:31.308
What kind of guy cashes in
on a $50 million business?

22:31.583 --> 22:33.483
A guy who wasn't happy.

22:34.453 --> 22:37.013
No, look, I started with a small business,
you know...

22:37.089 --> 22:38.681
like your cafe...

22:39.758 --> 22:42.750
and I got bored, I took some risks,
business picked up...

22:42.828 --> 22:45.194
and when I hit $50 million,
obviously, I realized...

22:45.263 --> 22:49.165
I could just coast on that forever.
But what's the point, you know...

22:49.234 --> 22:52.795
-if you're not getting challenged?
-And teaching is that challenge for you?

22:52.871 --> 22:54.338
Yeah, it scares me to death.

22:54.406 --> 22:57.398
I just know one of those weasels
in the front row will ask me...

22:57.476 --> 22:59.444
a question that I can't answer.

23:00.245 --> 23:02.805
What about you? Ever thought
about growing your business?

23:02.881 --> 23:07.477
Sure. I even drew up expansion plans.
But it was never the right time.

23:07.753 --> 23:09.084
It never is, you know.

23:09.154 --> 23:11.679
You just got to figure it out
as you go along.

23:11.757 --> 23:15.352
But if you ask me, the object of the game
is to make a difference.

23:17.362 --> 23:20.593
AII I'm saying is that a lot of kids
would support live music...

23:20.665 --> 23:23.862
if they had a night of their own.
And you manage more than one band.

23:23.935 --> 23:27.234
If you would work with me on this,
I know we could get a club owner...

23:27.305 --> 23:30.138
-to agree to try it out.
-Look, my band doesn't play to kids.

23:30.208 --> 23:32.768
We play to shot-and-beer crowds,
not high school proms.

23:32.844 --> 23:36.678
But what I'm saying is
an all-ages club could work in this town.

23:37.082 --> 23:39.209
Sorry. No dice. I'm just not interested.

23:39.284 --> 23:43.050
I swear to God, this is the last time
I hire a singer off a flyer at Kinko's.

23:43.121 --> 23:46.613
You know nothing, absolutely nothing
about music, man.

23:46.691 --> 23:50.320
I went to Berkeley, assface.
I studied a little thing called composition.

23:50.395 --> 23:51.555
You might wanna look into it.

23:51.630 --> 23:54.599
I will, next time I look in the audience
and they're ignoring us.

23:54.666 --> 23:55.758
Plant and Page.

23:56.701 --> 23:57.668
Have we met?

23:57.736 --> 23:58.760
Who's this?

23:58.837 --> 24:03.331
I was in the crowd the night that
you guys played together the first time.

24:04.042 --> 24:05.236
Go on.

24:05.310 --> 24:09.212
There were, like, 20 people
in the crowd that night but your energy...

24:09.281 --> 24:10.475
it was so real.

24:10.549 --> 24:13.541
You guys looked like you were gonna
explode up there on stage...

24:13.618 --> 24:15.108
but that's what made it work.

24:15.187 --> 24:17.280
That's the tension
that made Led Zeppelin work.

24:17.355 --> 24:20.552
It's the same tension
that sets your music apart.

24:21.793 --> 24:24.421
-The Key Club.
-That was a good night.

24:24.496 --> 24:26.464
They could all be good nights...

24:26.531 --> 24:30.126
if you'd just quit your bitching
and focus on what matters.

24:30.202 --> 24:33.069
But, then again, what do I know?
I'm just a kid.

24:33.138 --> 24:35.698
But if I were you guys,
I'd put my energy into the music.

24:35.774 --> 24:38.937
Otherwise, you'll be lucky
to play the high school prom.

24:41.746 --> 24:42.804
Bye.

24:51.356 --> 24:52.846
Thanks for coming back.

24:52.924 --> 24:54.721
Sorry about the crappy mood
the other day.

24:54.793 --> 24:56.317
I shouldn't have taken it out on you.

24:56.394 --> 24:59.989
That's cool. If it starts to become a habit,
find yourself another trainer.

25:00.065 --> 25:02.465
-New car?
-Dealership.

25:02.567 --> 25:06.196
I like to drive all the new models
to tell the customers what they're getting.

25:06.271 --> 25:09.172
The problem is,
the doctors won't let me drive, yet.

25:09.875 --> 25:11.069
You mind?

25:12.077 --> 25:13.009
Mind what?

25:13.345 --> 25:16.212
Taking it for a spin?
Tell me how she handles.

25:16.281 --> 25:19.682
Any kind of feedback would help.
We can stop somewhere along the way...

25:19.751 --> 25:21.878
and do some rehab. You game?

25:24.923 --> 25:28.552
Lucas, I can barely take a walk
without gasping for air right now.

25:28.727 --> 25:30.695
At least I have my work.

25:31.263 --> 25:33.561
You'd really be helping me out.

25:41.006 --> 25:44.567
Your job doesn't end getting the band.
You gotta take care of them.

25:44.643 --> 25:49.103
You've got to be part cheerleader,
part babysitter, part therapist.

25:50.448 --> 25:52.473
It's no problem. I can handle that.

25:52.551 --> 25:55.748
What I'm saying is,
you've got to look after all their needs.

25:55.820 --> 25:57.947
Food, drink, drugs.

25:58.723 --> 26:01.317
-Drugs?
-Don't worry.

26:01.526 --> 26:05.189
I'll set you up with the guys I buy from.
They're reliable.

26:05.797 --> 26:09.597
They're drug dealers, you don't want them
housesitting or anything...

26:10.635 --> 26:14.901
but they won't burn you.
I've got a good sense about people.

26:15.840 --> 26:17.330
You're young...

26:18.043 --> 26:21.035
but you might be worth the risk.

26:23.448 --> 26:24.813
No, thanks.

26:28.286 --> 26:30.151
Here's your shot, kid.

26:33.692 --> 26:35.284
What do you say?

26:44.302 --> 26:45.291
Brooke.

26:46.838 --> 26:48.305
What's wrong?

26:49.741 --> 26:52.141
I just keep screwing up this toe.

26:54.112 --> 26:55.306
Brooke.

26:56.715 --> 26:59.741
Okay, you know how I told you
that my credit card got declined...

26:59.818 --> 27:01.979
because the bill got paid late?

27:04.289 --> 27:05.881
That's a load of crap.

27:06.257 --> 27:09.192
-Well, what happened?
-We're broke.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.928
My dad's company went under...

27:14.065 --> 27:16.192
and they're doing
this stupid bankruptcy thing.

27:16.267 --> 27:19.600
And my mom's telling me
we might have to sell the house.

27:19.738 --> 27:21.763
God, Brooke, I'm so sorry.

27:22.841 --> 27:27.039
Yeah, me, too. I love being rich.
I'm good at it.

27:29.748 --> 27:32.239
So is that why Felix
is getting under your skin?

27:32.317 --> 27:35.184
Because he's the rich guy next door?

27:35.854 --> 27:37.651
I don't know. Maybe.

27:38.523 --> 27:43.426
Brooke, it's just money, you know?
There's so much more to you than that.

27:43.561 --> 27:45.688
Yeah, but that's my favorite part.

27:46.665 --> 27:49.964
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
How was your meeting?

27:51.770 --> 27:53.738
It's not gonna work out.

27:54.005 --> 27:55.199
Really?

27:56.975 --> 27:58.067
I'm sorry.

27:58.209 --> 28:00.837
Yeah. Me, too.

28:02.180 --> 28:05.911
Guns N' Roses, Whitesnake,
Metallica, Aerosmith.

28:07.752 --> 28:11.483
Please tell me you're kidding.
You didn't actually listen to metal.

28:11.990 --> 28:13.958
Even had my own spandex.

28:15.093 --> 28:18.551
Man, that is not a vision
I wanted to have in my head.

28:19.998 --> 28:22.398
-Lucas, right?
-Yeah.

28:23.201 --> 28:24.566
Nice wheels.

28:24.703 --> 28:27.331
Thanks. You know you're on
the wrong side of the road?

28:27.405 --> 28:29.839
Yeah, I know. Want to air it out?

28:32.510 --> 28:34.102
Maybe some other time.

28:34.179 --> 28:37.842
Come on. Race you for that girlfriend.
What's her name? Brooke?

28:38.650 --> 28:41.813
-Ex-girlfriend.
-Which was inevitable once I got to town.

28:42.120 --> 28:44.611
Don't hate the player, hate the game.

28:46.858 --> 28:49.554
Tell me you're gonna wipe the smirk
off that punk's face.

28:49.627 --> 28:52.255
Come on, my T-Bird could've taken him.

30:06.204 --> 30:08.331
What the hell are you doing?

30:08.439 --> 30:10.066
Come on, chicken.

30:33.531 --> 30:35.999
-You did the right thing.
-Yeah.

30:39.070 --> 30:41.903
Don't sweat it. Chicken's not for everyone.

30:43.308 --> 30:45.435
Who you got riding shotgun?

30:46.411 --> 30:49.312
This is my--

30:49.380 --> 30:51.644
Dan Scott. Scott Motors.

30:51.716 --> 30:55.516
When you're ready to trade up,
come on down to the dealership.

31:02.894 --> 31:05.089
We probably should get going.

31:09.634 --> 31:13.161
Hi. The printer dropped off the proofs
for the new menu.

31:13.238 --> 31:15.866
I wasn't sure if you were coming
by the cafe today, so....

31:15.940 --> 31:17.737
-These are great.
-Yeah.

31:18.476 --> 31:19.909
What's this?

31:20.278 --> 31:23.509
Cafe expansion plans
from a million years ago.

31:23.581 --> 31:26.482
-I was gonna add a bar.
-Why didn't you go through with it?

31:26.551 --> 31:30.487
You know the timing was never right.
I was so busy all day at the cafe.

31:30.588 --> 31:33.648
And I didn't want to give up my nights
with Lucas, too.

31:33.791 --> 31:35.656
Are you reconsidering?

31:36.127 --> 31:39.824
I'm writing a business plan for class.
A start-up for a new venture.

31:39.898 --> 31:42.332
But the more I play around
with these fake companies...

31:42.400 --> 31:45.699
the more I'm thinking
maybe it shouldn't be just an exercise.

31:45.770 --> 31:48.500
I had always hoped
to branch out someday.

31:49.674 --> 31:52.268
-Is that nuts?
-No, not at all.

31:52.343 --> 31:56.677
-In fact, I'll be one of your investors.
-You don't even know what I'm proposing.

31:56.748 --> 31:59.842
But I know you.
And I know how hard you'll work.

32:00.184 --> 32:02.345
Besides, what's life without a few risks?

32:25.476 --> 32:26.841
Excuse me.

32:29.480 --> 32:31.471
I need to check your bag.

32:31.716 --> 32:34.048
Okay, sure.

32:40.258 --> 32:43.421
-What's this?
-It's a birthday present from me.

32:44.128 --> 32:45.925
She's shy about buying stuff like this.

32:45.997 --> 32:48.488
But I guess that's part
of the turn-on, right?

32:48.566 --> 32:51.126
I would've come in
to check it out, sweetie.

32:51.202 --> 32:54.137
I was just gonna take it outside
to show him.

32:54.539 --> 32:57.736
Blue's perfect.
That's your color. We'll take it.

33:10.588 --> 33:13.853
-I've got to admit. It's a great car.
-Yeah.

33:15.259 --> 33:16.556
You want it?

33:25.069 --> 33:26.696
You can't buy me.

33:28.673 --> 33:31.005
Come on, Lucas. It's not like that.

33:32.210 --> 33:34.337
This is what I do for people I care about.

33:34.712 --> 33:36.646
You care about me, now?

33:36.714 --> 33:40.013
-You don't even know me.
-I want to. More than you know.

33:40.151 --> 33:42.346
We both know I owe it to you.

33:43.688 --> 33:45.986
You almost had me. You know that?

33:47.158 --> 33:51.060
Shame on me, right? I mean, I actually...

33:52.296 --> 33:55.857
enjoyed a day with you. Until now.

34:08.478 --> 34:10.947
Some town you got here.

34:13.251 --> 34:15.411
I mean, all the relationships are inbred...

34:15.485 --> 34:18.420
one of the hottest girls gets married,
if that's even legal.

34:18.489 --> 34:21.117
And the rich girl shoplifts for kicks.

34:23.061 --> 34:26.224
-What were you doing in there?
-I needed the new catalog.

34:26.397 --> 34:29.366
Besides, you meet the trashiest girls
in lingerie shops.

34:29.434 --> 34:30.924
Look, I don't....

34:31.569 --> 34:34.197
I mean, I've never done
anything like that before.

34:34.272 --> 34:38.174
-Clearly. You suck at it. Have fun?
-No.

34:39.043 --> 34:40.408
It's just....

34:42.413 --> 34:45.041
It was a mistake
and I'd like it to stay between us.

34:45.116 --> 34:46.811
I can keep a secret.

34:47.851 --> 34:50.946
-Promise?
-You'll just have to trust me.

34:52.023 --> 34:54.355
I don't know you well enough to trust you.

34:54.425 --> 34:55.755
You will.

34:56.694 --> 35:00.425
You might as well have it.
I'm planning on seeing you in it, soon.

35:00.665 --> 35:02.826
Not a chance in hell.

35:06.804 --> 35:08.704
You're welcome, Winona.

35:19.450 --> 35:21.748
You weren't even gonna come inside
and say hello?

35:21.819 --> 35:23.286
I'm working.

35:23.354 --> 35:26.323
-We got a call to pick up the car.
-Sure, you're working.

35:26.390 --> 35:28.017
You're emancipated now, right?

35:28.092 --> 35:30.253
Of course,
the old man's still setting the table.

35:30.328 --> 35:32.091
I've gotta get back.

35:32.530 --> 35:35.021
I had a heart attack. I could have died.

35:35.099 --> 35:37.499
Dad, we both know
that's never gonna happen.

35:37.568 --> 35:40.469
You can't jerk anybody's chains if you die.

35:41.139 --> 35:45.075
Look, just wait. Let's just talk.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.474
About what?

35:47.044 --> 35:49.308
I don't know. How's your wife?

35:55.520 --> 35:57.545
A lot happier than yours.

36:15.273 --> 36:18.674
Nate, come here.
I want to show you a couple of the basics.

36:21.379 --> 36:24.041
AII right, you see this battery clamp?

36:24.115 --> 36:25.844
If it gets corroded...

36:25.917 --> 36:27.976
the current can't get through
to the starter...

36:28.052 --> 36:30.782
and then you get that noise
when you crank it.

36:30.855 --> 36:32.482
Yeah, the noise.

36:32.557 --> 36:35.492
Yeah, and everybody thinks it's a big deal.
But it's not.

36:35.560 --> 36:38.893
You just clean it with a wire brush,
and you're good to go.

36:39.664 --> 36:42.189
That's so cool.
My dad never taught me this stuff.

36:42.266 --> 36:44.063
He didn't want me to be....

36:45.002 --> 36:48.529
He didn't want you to get grease
under your fingernails, like me.

36:49.907 --> 36:52.398
Look, that's my dad, Keith. That's not me.

36:52.543 --> 36:57.037
-So, how did it go at the house?
-Pretty much what you'd expect.

36:57.548 --> 37:00.540
In fact, I think I had so much fun
I'm gonna go back tonight...

37:00.618 --> 37:02.347
and I'm gonna disappoint
Haley some more.

37:02.420 --> 37:04.581
-Haley didn't like the keyboard?
-No, she liked it.

37:04.655 --> 37:07.522
She just wanted it to have four wheels
and a trunk.

37:12.330 --> 37:15.299
I think I might be able
to save your marriage.

37:16.767 --> 37:18.792
What do you think of this?

37:20.238 --> 37:24.504
I think it was probably a pretty sweet ride
back when dinosaurs ruled the earth.

37:24.575 --> 37:27.806
I was gonna sell it for parts
but we could work on it together.

37:27.878 --> 37:30.438
Fix it up and then you can have it.

37:30.648 --> 37:33.708
-So it's like a family project.
-Yeah, you bet.

37:39.790 --> 37:41.314
We'll fix that.

37:56.340 --> 37:58.672
If I'd known you couldn't play any better
than that...

37:58.743 --> 38:00.802
I wouldn't have brought it home.

38:03.648 --> 38:07.709
I want to apologize, all right?
That was your money, too.

38:07.885 --> 38:11.343
It's not that, Nathan. I totally overreacted.

38:12.189 --> 38:15.283
Partly because I love this gift.

38:15.593 --> 38:18.027
And I love you for getting it for me.

38:18.696 --> 38:21.688
But partly because we can't be
as careless as we used to be.

38:21.766 --> 38:23.597
Not if we want
to make this marriage work.

38:23.668 --> 38:26.159
I know, you're right.
And I don't know the first thing...

38:26.237 --> 38:29.297
about managing money.
It was just always around.

38:29.373 --> 38:31.068
Yeah, well.

38:31.142 --> 38:33.667
At least you don't have
that problem anymore.

38:38.649 --> 38:41.379
Hales, I want you to keep this keyboard.

38:41.786 --> 38:44.414
Okay? You have a talent
and you need to use it.

38:44.488 --> 38:46.786
-Nathan, I--
-You're keeping it.

38:50.895 --> 38:55.059
Besides, there's an old car at work
that Keith said I could fix up.

38:55.800 --> 38:58.325
-He's gonna help you?
-Yeah.

39:01.339 --> 39:04.900
I really wanted to keep it! Thank you.

39:11.982 --> 39:13.472
He didn't want to see me?

39:15.553 --> 39:17.783
He didn't want to see either of us.

39:21.759 --> 39:23.590
Remember when he was little?

39:23.661 --> 39:26.528
I used to take him to work with me
on Saturdays.

39:26.797 --> 39:29.493
He'd have to get up early,
but he didn't mind.

39:29.667 --> 39:32.158
He wanted to hang out with his dad.

39:35.439 --> 39:37.907
Now I'm thinking it was all a lie.

39:39.310 --> 39:42.541
What if I've spent my life
chasing the wrong things, Deb?

39:43.214 --> 39:46.149
Success, money, respect.

39:49.153 --> 39:53.419
What if it turns out none of it matters
because I lost my family along the way?

39:57.528 --> 39:59.086
Can I get it back?

40:00.398 --> 40:01.922
Is it too late?

40:03.200 --> 40:04.599
I don't know.

41:01.425 --> 41:03.290
Hey, Karen. What's up?

41:07.765 --> 41:11.758
It was such a good space
for Nathan and Haley's party.

41:12.369 --> 41:15.031
And I think it would make a great club.

41:16.440 --> 41:18.806
The only thing is,
I'm gonna need someone...

41:18.876 --> 41:21.845
who could run my all-ages night.

41:24.248 --> 41:28.207
You had a great idea, Peyton.
And I know you'd be worth the risk.

41:29.820 --> 41:31.481
What do you think?

42:11.295 --> 42:15.026
I'll give you $1,000
for a decent cup of coffee.

42:34.785 --> 42:36.150
You're right.

42:42.293 --> 42:43.954
My pool is better.

43:32.576 --> 43:33.634
