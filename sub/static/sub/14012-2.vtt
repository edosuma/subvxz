<i> the people are represented</i>

00:06.240 --> 00:08.173
<i> The police,</i>

<i> and the district attorneys,</i>
<i> who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:10.778 --> 00:14.213
<i> These are their stories.</i>

00:14.215 --> 00:17.383
They want all cops
to live in the city.

00:17.385 --> 00:18.484
On our salaries?

00:18.486 --> 00:21.220
I don't think
this is beef, man.

00:21.222 --> 00:23.622
(<i> yelling in Cantonese</i> )

00:23.624 --> 00:26.492
Somebody didn't want
to pay for dinner.

00:26.494 --> 00:28.560
It's too greasy.

00:30.097 --> 00:31.330
Officers, please.

00:31.332 --> 00:34.066
Restaurant bills--
we don't get involved.

00:34.068 --> 00:35.334
Go to small claims court.

00:35.336 --> 00:35.801
No, no.

00:40.307 --> 00:41.440
Downstairs, I push buzzer.

00:41.442 --> 00:42.574
No answer.

00:42.576 --> 00:45.377
Lady walk out,
I walk in.

00:45.379 --> 00:48.647
They owe $26.

00:50.384 --> 00:54.820
I very sorry I
come in, but $26.

00:54.822 --> 00:57.389
(<i> repeating figure</i>

01:05.533 --> 01:07.566

I no touch anything.

01:07.568 --> 01:08.834
I no take anything.

01:08.836 --> 01:11.203
Tell him to shut up.

02:41.529 --> 02:42.895
The order
was called in at 9:05,

02:42.897 --> 02:44.763
and the delivery boy
found them at 9:40.

02:44.765 --> 02:45.898
(<i> fly buzzing</i> )

02:45.900 --> 02:47.266
Close the door.

02:47.268 --> 02:48.767
It's the smell.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.235
The flies will come in
for the blood.

02:50.237 --> 02:52.871
Close the door.

02:54.808 --> 02:58.710
Well... silver, jewelry,
cash untouched.

02:58.712 --> 03:00.746
This is a Con Ed bill.

03:00.748 --> 03:03.215
Mr. And Mrs. Edward Cullen.

03:03.217 --> 03:05.217
Young wife.

03:05.219 --> 03:06.752
Yeah.

03:06.754 --> 03:07.886
I don't know.

03:07.888 --> 03:09.555
Four closets
with his clothes.

03:09.557 --> 03:10.822
One closet with hers?

03:10.824 --> 03:12.958
No wallet, no purse,
no credit cards?

03:12.960 --> 03:15.794
Come on.

03:15.796 --> 03:18.931
It's the strangest marriage
I've ever seen.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.670
Two of them?

03:24.672 --> 03:26.905
What... what did you say?

03:26.907 --> 03:28.907
Ed and Melanie,
they're getting divorced.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.375
She doesn't live here anymore.

03:30.377 --> 03:32.211
Is she blonde,
about 30?

03:32.213 --> 03:36.615
Blonde, but if Melanie's 30,
I'm Vanilla Ice.

03:36.617 --> 03:37.616
Who?

03:37.618 --> 03:38.917
It wasn't the wife.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.953
Where we can find
Mrs. Cullen?

03:45.926 --> 03:47.392
(<i> voice breaks</i> ):
We were, uh...

03:47.394 --> 03:50.796
we were separated
for 15 months.

03:50.798 --> 03:55.834
That doesn't mean
that I stopped loving him.

03:57.638 --> 03:59.838
Take your time.

03:59.840 --> 04:03.275
We just want to find out
who did this.

04:03.277 --> 04:05.744
Did your husband
have any enemies?

04:05.746 --> 04:06.945
You know, I mean

04:06.947 --> 04:09.014
business or anything?

04:10.951 --> 04:13.285
Eddie owed people money

04:13.287 --> 04:17.422
but not enough
for somebody to kill him.

04:17.424 --> 04:19.591
Your husband, Mrs. Cullen--

04:19.593 --> 04:21.994
when is the last time
you saw him?

04:21.996 --> 04:23.829
Three...

04:25.299 --> 04:29.835
<i>four</i> months ago
with the lawyers.

04:29.837 --> 04:33.005
Not a friendly divorce?

04:36.277 --> 04:38.677
It was amicable.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.712
People change.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.948
Did you know
your husband's friend?

04:42.950 --> 04:44.783
She was blonde, about 30.

04:46.887 --> 04:49.855
A woman was shot
with your husband

04:49.857 --> 04:51.323
in the bedroom.

04:51.325 --> 04:53.925
Uh-uh.

04:53.927 --> 04:55.294
Could you tell me

04:55.296 --> 04:58.830
what you were doing tonight,
Mrs. Cullen?

05:00.734 --> 05:05.003
I was married to him
for 25 years.

05:05.005 --> 05:07.806
Do you think
I could shoot him?

05:09.977 --> 05:13.345
I was here...

05:13.347 --> 05:17.082
with Jamie, our... my son.

05:19.019 --> 05:22.454
He went home
a half hour ago to study.

05:22.456 --> 05:24.423
Would you give us his address.

05:24.425 --> 05:27.759
Do you mind
if I call him first?

05:27.761 --> 05:30.962
Let<i> me</i> tell him
his father's dead.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.931
Of course.

05:35.736 --> 05:38.103
Everybody liked him.

05:38.105 --> 05:45.110
CERRETA:
Construction is not always
a friendly business, Jamie.

05:45.112 --> 05:46.912
Are you saying my dad
was some kind of gangster?

05:50.918 --> 05:54.353
Why would anybody kill him?

05:54.355 --> 05:56.388
You work with your father?

05:56.390 --> 05:58.457
Yeah.

05:58.459 --> 06:02.728
Um... putting up frames.

06:02.730 --> 06:05.097
He wanted me
to get into law school.

06:05.099 --> 06:07.899
Course for the law boards.

06:09.903 --> 06:12.070
Who was your father's
girlfriend?

06:12.072 --> 06:14.740
I didn't know
he had a girlfriend.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.942
You guys had to tell my mother?

06:16.944 --> 06:18.810
You were with her tonight?

06:20.914 --> 06:25.984
Um... I have dinner with her
a couple times a month.

06:25.986 --> 06:32.424
She still can't get used
to... living alone.

06:32.426 --> 06:35.026
When did you leave,
about 10:00, right?

06:35.028 --> 06:37.496
About 11:00.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.900
I guess it's, uh...

06:41.902 --> 06:44.102
I guess it's your job
thinking these things, you guys,

06:44.104 --> 06:47.139
but it's crazy.

06:47.141 --> 06:50.409
My mother wouldn't kill
my father.

06:56.984 --> 06:57.983
Six slugs.

06:57.985 --> 06:59.918
Talk about coitus interruptus.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.153
You bring me a .38?

07:01.155 --> 07:03.755
It's out there somewhere.

07:03.757 --> 07:04.990
Only seven... 800,000
of them around.

07:04.992 --> 07:07.459
You're looking for an old one,
heavy rifling.

07:07.461 --> 07:09.961
Run Melanie and
Edward Cullen.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.096
Done.

07:11.098 --> 07:14.132
No registrations New York,
Connecticut,

07:14.134 --> 07:16.168
Jersey and Pennsylvania.

07:16.170 --> 07:18.036
She does card tricks, too.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.070
Try this trick.

07:19.072 --> 07:21.173
Go through every
.38 slug you got

07:21.175 --> 07:23.008
and if that doesn't work,

07:23.010 --> 07:24.910
start with our
friends in Hoboken

07:24.912 --> 07:28.580
and Long Island City and
work your way east and west.

07:28.582 --> 07:31.116
Sure, but it's a big haystack.

07:34.021 --> 07:37.522
The wife and the kid
may be telling the truth.

07:37.524 --> 07:38.623
Yeah.

07:38.625 --> 07:41.059
Or the kid's lying
to cover for her.

07:41.061 --> 07:43.528
Or she's lying to cover for him.

07:43.530 --> 07:46.798
Or maybe they got up
after the lasagna,

07:46.800 --> 07:49.801
cabbed it to 73rd Street
and whacked

07:49.803 --> 07:51.203
the happy couple
together.

07:51.205 --> 07:52.471
You know, we do have

07:52.473 --> 07:54.072
other people in this town.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.007
Have you considered
anybody else?

07:56.009 --> 07:58.109
Well, there's no mob angle
because, as you know,

07:58.111 --> 07:59.945
they use .22s, not .38s.

07:59.947 --> 08:03.048
So? You figure Cullen got
up at a delicate moment

08:03.050 --> 08:06.051
let the killer in and then
hopped back in the sack?

08:06.053 --> 08:08.220
I figure somebody
had a key.

08:08.222 --> 08:10.055
Phil, I know it
looks obvious,

08:10.057 --> 08:12.023
but before we
sentence the wife,

08:12.025 --> 08:13.258
remember we do have
two victims here

08:13.260 --> 08:15.026
and one of them
is still wearing

08:15.028 --> 08:18.129
a tag on her
toe-- Jane Doe.

08:18.131 --> 08:20.131
Maybe she had
an enemy.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.867
Maybe she had a name.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.101
Middle-age guy has
a babe like that,

08:23.103 --> 08:24.636
he spreads the news.

08:24.638 --> 08:27.572
Ask at the office.

08:27.574 --> 08:30.976
I always told Ed,
"Stick to your core business.

08:30.978 --> 08:34.179
Residential in Queens,
commercial in Manhattan."

08:34.181 --> 08:37.082
No. He wants to do condos,
First Avenue.

08:37.084 --> 08:38.550
You his partner?

08:38.552 --> 08:40.051
Sales manager.

08:40.053 --> 08:42.854
And I know what sells.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.289
He wants to leave Melanie.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.124
I said, "She's Brooklyn.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.092
"You're Brooklyn.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.260
That's your core."

08:48.262 --> 08:49.895
You think it was the girlfriend?

08:49.897 --> 08:51.029
No, she came later.

08:51.031 --> 08:51.997
You know, mid-life crisis.

08:51.999 --> 08:53.131
Business goes bad.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.599
He wants a divorce.

08:54.601 --> 08:56.134
He cons Melanie
into moving out.

08:56.136 --> 08:58.570
Promises he's going
to sell the apartment.

08:58.572 --> 09:01.907
This dead boss of yours
sounds like a real charmer.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.942
Only bad guys
leave their wives?

09:03.944 --> 09:06.945
Every guy who knew Ed Cullen
thought he was terrific.

09:06.947 --> 09:09.047
Alexandra Beckett--
what is that, with two "T's"?

09:09.049 --> 09:10.282
One or two--
I never met her.

09:10.284 --> 09:12.150
He kept her mostly secret.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.151
You happen to know
where she lived?

09:13.153 --> 09:14.686
No.

09:14.688 --> 09:17.656
But she worked
at Christie's.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.697
Oh, God.

09:25.699 --> 09:29.601
It's Alexandra.

09:29.603 --> 09:31.603
This was her big sale.

09:31.605 --> 09:33.605
Could we go downstairs?

09:33.607 --> 09:35.340
Yeah, sure.

09:39.713 --> 09:42.180
Did you know
her boyfriend?

09:42.182 --> 09:44.349
Mm-hmm.
Doug Phillips.

09:46.019 --> 09:48.286
How many boyfriends
did she have?

09:48.288 --> 09:49.955
Oh. You mean Edward.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.022
You said boyfriend.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.591
She broke up with him

09:52.593 --> 09:54.726
when she started
seeing Edward.

09:54.728 --> 09:57.729
In other words,
she traded in a boy for a man?

09:57.731 --> 10:00.699
Um, he... Doug dropped out
of Wharton.

10:00.701 --> 10:03.602
He dropped out
of Yale architecture.

10:03.604 --> 10:05.103
Edward was solid.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.138
He knew what he wanted.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.740
What he wanted was Alexandra?

10:08.742 --> 10:11.710
He adored her.

10:11.712 --> 10:15.146
Doug must have been thrilled.

10:15.148 --> 10:17.215
He have a temper?

10:17.217 --> 10:20.185
Oh, no, no, no, no.

10:20.187 --> 10:23.054
Doug would have never
have killed Alexandra.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.389
But he might
have killed Cullen.

10:28.128 --> 10:31.262
There... there was a scene
in a restaurant.

10:31.264 --> 10:34.015
With Cullen?

10:34.016 --> 10:36.767
Uh, Edward was there
with Alexandra at Vicenzo's

10:36.770 --> 10:42.374
and, uh, Doug walked in, drunk,
and he punched him.

10:44.111 --> 10:47.078
P-H-I-L-L-I-P-S.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.380
First name Douglas.

10:48.382 --> 10:50.081
Run him for his
prints, will you?

10:50.083 --> 10:52.083
And his phone--
message unit details.

10:52.085 --> 10:53.418
Hey, Bobby. Bobby.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.754
Get a subpoena for
his MUDs, all right?

10:55.756 --> 10:57.088
Got you.
BOBBY:

10:57.090 --> 11:00.225
(<i> phones ringing</i> )

11:00.227 --> 11:01.760
Usage details.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.662
Phillips called
his girlfriend's apartment

11:03.664 --> 11:08.233
and Cullen's apartment 50 times.

11:08.235 --> 11:09.685
There's no gun

11:09.686 --> 11:11.136
registered to Phillips
in New York

11:11.138 --> 11:12.837
and there's no match
yet on the slugs.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.239
Yeah, but he called
Cullen's apartment

11:14.241 --> 11:15.807
the night of the murder.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.342
Yeah. Keep checking
the other states

11:17.344 --> 11:20.078
and keep looking
for a match.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.113
The kid had an altruistic phase.

11:22.115 --> 11:24.249
Taught public school one summer.

11:24.251 --> 11:25.784
So you got his prints?

11:25.786 --> 11:28.720
They match a set
in Cullen's apartment.

11:28.722 --> 11:30.522
You're welcome.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.323
And may I suggest
a search warrant?

11:33.794 --> 11:36.828
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.129
I didn't kill her.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.330
I wanted to marry her.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.199
Did she want to marry you?

11:41.201 --> 11:43.168
What was she doing at Cullen's?

11:43.170 --> 11:44.803
Shopping for her trousseau?

11:44.805 --> 11:46.171
Are these yours?

11:46.173 --> 11:47.272
Hers. Spares.

11:47.274 --> 11:49.441
She was my girlfriend.

11:49.443 --> 11:51.409
She used to sleep here.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.244
(<i> sighs</i> )

11:53.246 --> 11:55.113
We'd like you to come
down to the precinct.

11:55.115 --> 11:58.183
Just to ask
a few questions.

11:58.185 --> 11:59.851
I want to call a lawyer.

11:59.853 --> 12:02.287
So he slugged him once
weeks ago.

12:02.289 --> 12:03.888
That's not murder.

12:03.890 --> 12:07.292
He was a sleaze in a
thousand-dollar suit.

12:07.294 --> 12:10.729
With a nicer apartment
than yours.

12:10.731 --> 12:13.298
Alexandra had a weakness
for older men

12:13.300 --> 12:16.167
which is a joke if
you know her father.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.837
What are you saying here,
am I a suspect?

12:18.839 --> 12:22.407
LOGAN:
Hey, listen, everybody's a
suspect until they're cleared.

12:22.409 --> 12:25.510
But let's just say
that you didn't kill Cullen.

12:25.512 --> 12:28.279
Have you ever been
in his apartment?

12:30.217 --> 12:33.184
Once. A cocktail party
with Alexandra

12:33.186 --> 12:35.186
four or five months ago.

12:35.188 --> 12:39.390
He was trying to get
on the board of a dance company.

12:39.392 --> 12:40.525
Pathetic.

12:40.527 --> 12:43.394
They wanted his money
and his view.

12:43.396 --> 12:47.265
Your girlfriend liked
a lot more than the view.

12:47.267 --> 12:50.168
Up yours, pal.

12:50.170 --> 12:51.870
Do I have to
take this crap?

12:51.872 --> 12:53.689
CERRETA:
Nice work.

12:53.690 --> 12:55.507
Bait him. Calm him down.
Rev him up again.

12:55.509 --> 12:58.943
LOGAN:
You talk to Alexandra
the night she was killed?

12:58.945 --> 13:02.147
I was home.

13:02.149 --> 13:03.248
You call anybody?

13:03.250 --> 13:07.285
Anybody call you?

13:07.287 --> 13:10.488
You called Cullen's apartment
an hour before he died.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.357
The call lasted six minutes.

13:12.359 --> 13:13.525
Not another word.

13:13.527 --> 13:14.893
Let's go. That's it.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.161
Interview's over.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.296
You charge him
or you let him go.

13:26.406 --> 13:29.307
Prints, motive,
opportunity.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.876
Those prints could have been
five months old.

13:31.878 --> 13:33.378
Or 96 hours.

13:33.380 --> 13:34.546
How did he get in?

13:34.548 --> 13:36.314
Kid had a key to
the girl's apartment.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.448
She had a key
to Cullen's.

13:37.450 --> 13:39.184
I'm figuring one
plus one equals two.

13:39.186 --> 13:40.451
The girl was shot first.

13:40.453 --> 13:42.520
He's gonna kill them,
he'd pop the guy first.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.189
Come on, Mike, he's
angry enough to shoot her

13:44.191 --> 13:45.323
but not angry enough
to shoot her first?

13:45.325 --> 13:46.858
I wish we had a gun.

13:46.860 --> 13:49.327
I wish I had a
girlfriend named Lola.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.863
(<i> chuckles</i> )

13:51.865 --> 13:53.832
What do you think, Counselor?

13:53.834 --> 13:56.868
We've gotten indictments
on a lot less.

13:56.870 --> 13:59.070
They don't sell hot guns
at Brooks Brothers.

13:59.071 --> 14:01.271
I am telling you, this twerp
wouldn't know where to get one.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.274
Come on, Phil,
even rich jerks

14:03.276 --> 14:07.412
can get a .38
in this town.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.422
Douglas Phillips,
you're under arrest

14:17.424 --> 14:21.292
for the murder of Edward Cullen
and Alexandra Beckett.

14:21.294 --> 14:23.494
You have the right
to remain silent...

14:25.966 --> 14:27.165
Not guilty.

14:27.167 --> 14:29.267
Your Honor,
these are vicious murders

14:29.268 --> 14:31.368
committed by a privileged young
man who considers himself

14:31.371 --> 14:34.105
beyond the norms
of society.

14:34.107 --> 14:36.041
The people request
substantial bail.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.976
Your Honor, Mr. Phillips
has never been arrested before.

14:37.978 --> 14:40.979
He has strong family
roots in New York City.

14:40.981 --> 14:43.114
His grandfather
sat on the bench

14:43.116 --> 14:45.416
where Your Honor
now presides.

14:45.418 --> 14:48.386
I hope he worked shorter hours
than I do.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.154
200,000.

14:50.156 --> 14:53.992
JUDGE:
I'll be back in ten.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.894
What? What are we doing here?

14:55.896 --> 14:57.896
No gun, no witness,
no record...

14:57.898 --> 14:59.998
He'd have a record
if Cullen had called the cops

15:00.000 --> 15:01.666
after he slugged him.

15:01.667 --> 15:03.333
You want to make a case,
he'll plead to assault.

15:03.336 --> 15:06.471
How about manslaughter one,
crime of passion?

15:10.377 --> 15:11.943
LOGAN:
Here you go.

15:11.945 --> 15:13.978
Best hot dog
in the city?

15:13.980 --> 15:16.047
86th and Third,
the Papaya Place.

15:16.049 --> 15:18.082
There may be hope
for you yet.

15:19.219 --> 15:21.286
Ptomaine city.

15:21.288 --> 15:22.553
You want this?

15:22.555 --> 15:24.022
Yeah.

15:25.525 --> 15:28.026
What's around here?

15:28.028 --> 15:29.394
Antonio's.

15:29.396 --> 15:31.129
Go get some calamari.

15:31.131 --> 15:33.431
Listen, Phil, I don't eat
anything that squirts ink, okay?

15:38.038 --> 15:40.038
"Mrs. Cullen thanked the police

15:40.040 --> 15:43.441
for apprehending
her husband's killer."

15:43.443 --> 15:46.177
What, did she
send you a note?

15:46.179 --> 15:47.979
You tell me.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.317
How did Phillips get in?

15:54.321 --> 15:56.054
Cragen could be right.

15:56.056 --> 15:57.956
He lifted the girl's key.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.290
You buy it?

16:02.128 --> 16:04.095
You don't think
he did it?

16:04.097 --> 16:05.363
The Cullen kid--

16:05.365 --> 16:07.966
spent a lot of time
with his father.

16:07.968 --> 16:10.101
Yeah. He probably
had a key.

16:10.103 --> 16:12.003
Remember what he said?

16:12.005 --> 16:13.604
He said, "My mother
wouldn't kill my father."

16:13.606 --> 16:15.606
He was with her
at the time of the murder.

16:15.608 --> 16:22.981
Why didn't he say, "My mother
<i>didn't</i> kill my father"?

16:22.983 --> 16:24.048
You want to reopen

16:24.050 --> 16:26.484
'cause the kid used
the wrong tense?

16:26.486 --> 16:27.986
It's not just that.

16:27.988 --> 16:29.504
These snot-nosed rich kids--

16:29.505 --> 16:31.021
you look at them funny,
they fall apart.

16:31.024 --> 16:32.590
Phillips-- he didn't break.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.025
This a conspiracy?

16:34.027 --> 16:35.259
You guys in on this together?

16:35.261 --> 16:36.561
Cullen and the girlfriend

16:36.563 --> 16:37.628
are shacking up
for four months.

16:37.630 --> 16:39.097
The wife never
heard of her?

16:39.099 --> 16:40.232
The son never noticed?

16:40.233 --> 16:41.366
Come on, her clothes
are in his apartment.

16:41.368 --> 16:43.101
The son go blind?

16:43.103 --> 16:44.635
The son has no motive,

16:44.637 --> 16:46.637
the wife has an alibi.

16:46.639 --> 16:51.109
What about the alibi's alibi?

16:55.115 --> 16:56.547
Jamie Cullen.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.218
Excuse me, dear.

17:04.090 --> 17:08.559
Hmm, looks like he'll be back
for another try.

17:08.561 --> 17:13.398
Checks out the review tapes,
but his test exams... marginal.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.133
Very.

17:15.135 --> 17:17.635
Have his scores dipped lately?

17:17.637 --> 17:19.303
Bad and steady.

17:19.305 --> 17:24.142
We set him up in a study group,
seven other students...

17:24.144 --> 17:26.144
Oh, look at this.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.479
He missed class Thursday night.

17:28.481 --> 17:33.351
You got the names of those kids,
the ones in the study group?

17:33.353 --> 17:35.153
I'm trying to get
into law school

17:35.155 --> 17:38.189
because my father told me that
education is wasted on women.

17:38.191 --> 17:39.690
Jamie wants to go

17:39.692 --> 17:43.561
because his father wanted him
to make something of himself.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.596
Did he have a problem
with his father?

17:45.598 --> 17:49.434
Jamie has a problem
with the law boards.

17:49.436 --> 17:51.436
He liked his father.

17:51.438 --> 17:54.238
You took him his notes
after class.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.240
For what it's worth.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.676
Well, what time
did you get there?

17:58.678 --> 18:02.713
About... 9:00, 9:10.

18:02.715 --> 18:04.649
You leave them
at the door?

18:04.651 --> 18:07.718
No. I gave them to Jamie.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.724
You're sure about the time?

18:13.726 --> 18:15.526
I'm positive.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.465
So you arrested somebody,
right?

18:20.467 --> 18:22.467
Why are you asking me this?

18:22.469 --> 18:23.734
(<i> sighs</i> )

18:23.736 --> 18:25.169
It's a slow day,
and I don't know,

18:25.171 --> 18:26.604
we thought
we'd kill some time.

18:26.606 --> 18:30.475
Jamie, you weren't
with your mother.

18:30.477 --> 18:32.477
I had dinner with her.

18:32.478 --> 18:34.478
What do you think this is,
some kind of a schoolyard game?

18:34.481 --> 18:35.546
No, I didn't.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.849
Yes, you did.

18:37.850 --> 18:40.151
You want us to prove it,
we will prove it.

18:44.524 --> 18:46.157
Okay.

18:46.159 --> 18:47.391
I was with her.

18:47.393 --> 18:49.660
I was there until about 8:30.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.362
She called me up.

18:51.364 --> 18:52.663
She was scared.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.665
She said you accused her.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.467
Did she tell you to lie?

18:56.469 --> 18:59.704
She didn't kill my father.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.343
We're barely out the door,

19:05.345 --> 19:08.379
she's already on the horn
telling the kid to lie.

19:08.381 --> 19:10.381
The good news: Great
Neck, four years ago.

19:10.383 --> 19:12.316
Your .38 hit a burglar.

19:12.318 --> 19:14.252
You're not going to ask?

19:14.254 --> 19:15.453
The dog ate it?

19:15.455 --> 19:17.622
Stolen-- three years ago.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.725
Stolen from who?

19:20.727 --> 19:23.327
Right out
of my apartment, man.

19:23.329 --> 19:26.497
Somebody must have come in
the fire escape.

19:26.499 --> 19:27.765
I reported it.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.767
Where were you
working then?

19:29.769 --> 19:31.502
What, three years ago?

19:31.504 --> 19:33.771
I don't remember,
and that's the damn truth.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.773
Your boss says it was
a construction site

19:35.775 --> 19:37.175
in Nassau County.

19:37.177 --> 19:38.409
Well, if you say so.

19:38.411 --> 19:40.061
I do say so.

19:40.062 --> 19:41.712
How long you been a
security guard, George?

19:41.714 --> 19:43.548
14 years.

19:43.550 --> 19:45.283
For 14 years?

19:45.285 --> 19:47.185
The state of New York
says in 14 years

19:47.187 --> 19:48.519
you had three registered
guns, two of them stolen.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.421
You're a hell
of a security guard, George.

19:50.423 --> 19:52.390
You ought to hire a guard
to watch your guns.

19:52.392 --> 19:54.292
Look, I live
in a rough neighborhood.

19:54.294 --> 19:56.727
Your last stolen gun
has two bodies on it.

19:56.729 --> 19:59.197
You sold that, it's a felony.

19:59.199 --> 20:01.465
Maybe you like accessory
to murder better?

20:01.467 --> 20:03.201
Hey, do you think

20:03.203 --> 20:05.203
we can't find out what
happened to your guns?

20:05.205 --> 20:06.370
We'll tear your
life apart.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.239
Or you tell us,
plead to a misdemeanor,

20:08.241 --> 20:10.408
find yourself
a new career.

20:10.409 --> 20:12.576
He said he couldn't
get a license.

20:12.579 --> 20:13.778
He carried a lot of cash

20:13.780 --> 20:15.813
and he needed a gun
for protection.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.215
He gave me $500.

20:17.217 --> 20:19.450
He? Are you trying
to annoy me?

20:19.452 --> 20:20.585
Is that what
he's trying to do?

20:20.587 --> 20:21.819
He's trying to get
on my nerves, right?

20:21.821 --> 20:23.754
The boss, Mr. Cullen.

20:25.592 --> 20:27.458
His own gun.

20:27.460 --> 20:28.693
I love this.

20:28.695 --> 20:31.295
So he killed the girl,
killed himself

20:31.297 --> 20:32.530
and then threw the gun
out the window.

20:32.532 --> 20:34.666
CERRETA:
Come on.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.801
He had the gun in the apartment
for three years.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.402
The wife
didn't know about it?

20:38.404 --> 20:39.537
The kid didn't know about it?

20:39.539 --> 20:41.739
But how would
Doug Phillips know?

20:41.741 --> 20:43.474
The wife's alibi isshot.

20:43.476 --> 20:45.576
You have means
and opportunity.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.445
What about motive?

20:47.447 --> 20:48.879
Try blonde and 30.

20:48.881 --> 20:50.581
Not to mention money.

20:50.583 --> 20:51.882
She says he was broke.

20:51.884 --> 20:53.818
He sure didn't live
like he was broke.

20:53.820 --> 20:57.421
Go rattle her chain.

20:57.423 --> 20:59.890
MELANIE:
Why would I need a lawyer?

20:59.892 --> 21:03.761
CERRETA:
Because you're a suspect
in the murder of your husband

21:03.763 --> 21:06.330
and Alexandra Beckett.

21:06.332 --> 21:09.867
I told my son to lie
because I was afraid.

21:09.869 --> 21:11.535
Afraid your husband

21:11.537 --> 21:13.871
was going to leave you
without a dime?

21:16.843 --> 21:19.577
We were married for 25 years

21:19.579 --> 21:23.714
and I haven't had a job
since I got engaged.

21:23.716 --> 21:27.351
I was a salesgirl
at B. Altman then

21:27.353 --> 21:30.921
and now I don't even know
what category to look under.

21:30.923 --> 21:34.925
How about "housewife from
Kings Highway, Brooklyn"?

21:37.764 --> 21:41.399
There's nothing wrong with being
a housewife from Kings Highway.

21:41.401 --> 21:43.734
Unless your husband wants
a hostess from Georgetown.

21:45.672 --> 21:48.539
Ever see something like this?

21:48.541 --> 21:49.540
Yeah.

21:49.542 --> 21:52.376
On TV.

21:52.378 --> 21:53.778
Your husband had one of these.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.813
Do you know where he kept it?

21:55.815 --> 22:00.918
I haven't been in that apartment
for a year.

22:00.920 --> 22:04.355
The gun's been there
for three years.

22:10.330 --> 22:12.396
I just buried my husband.

22:16.369 --> 22:18.903
Is this one solid?

22:18.905 --> 22:20.838
She lied about
her alibi.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.707
She lied about the gun, too.

22:22.709 --> 22:24.842
We lifted her prints
off the photo of the gun.

22:24.844 --> 22:27.712
They matched the prints
on Cullen's doorknob.

22:27.714 --> 22:30.648
Hard to believe
they stayed there over a year.

22:30.650 --> 22:32.817
And ten-to-one, she lied
about knowing the girlfriend.

22:32.819 --> 22:34.385
You need a scorecard

22:34.387 --> 22:36.520
to keep track of the lies
with this broad.

22:36.522 --> 22:38.723
They convinced me.

22:38.725 --> 22:42.727
Okay. We'll dismiss
on the boyfriend.

22:42.729 --> 22:44.995
Pick her up.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.567
MAN:
<i> in the second degree</i>

22:49.569 --> 22:53.671
and manslaughter
in the first degree.

22:53.673 --> 22:57.608
Is the defendant ready
to enter a plea?

22:57.610 --> 22:59.577
Not guilty.

22:59.579 --> 23:00.611
Your Honor, this was a vicious
double murder...

23:00.613 --> 23:02.446
JUDGE:
What is this?

23:02.448 --> 23:04.482
Déjà vu all over again?

23:04.484 --> 23:05.983
Didn't I hear this speech
two weeks ago

23:05.985 --> 23:07.651
with a different defendant?

23:07.653 --> 23:09.587
The people have rectified
their error.

23:09.589 --> 23:11.589
LEHRMAN:
Your honor, they're
compounding their error.

23:11.591 --> 23:14.558
There's no predicting
who they'll arrest next.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.727
Mrs. Cullen
is a grief-stricken widow...

23:16.729 --> 23:18.396
Save it, Counselor.

23:18.398 --> 23:19.930
Same crime, same bail.

23:19.932 --> 23:22.133
200,000.

23:22.135 --> 23:23.968
LEHRMAN:
Murder two?

23:23.970 --> 23:26.971
Why even have it
on the menu?

23:26.973 --> 23:28.973
This isn't murder.

23:28.975 --> 23:30.741
It's manslaughter.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.576
You're admitting
she killed them.

23:32.578 --> 23:33.644
No.

23:33.646 --> 23:34.712
But if she killed them,

23:34.714 --> 23:36.514
it was extreme
emotional disturbance.

23:36.516 --> 23:37.548
That's manslaughter.

23:37.550 --> 23:40.484
I get it.
She wasn't there,

23:40.486 --> 23:42.586
and if she was,
she didn't kill them,

23:42.588 --> 23:44.572
and if she did,
she didn't mean to,

23:44.573 --> 23:46.557
and if she did mean to,
it was because she was upset.

23:46.559 --> 23:48.692
Cute.

23:48.694 --> 23:50.628
The murder charge is inflated.

23:50.630 --> 23:54.064
If she killed in the heat of
passion and you can prove it?

23:54.066 --> 23:57.001
Her husband was in bed
with another woman.

23:57.003 --> 23:59.103
Juries tend to be sympathetic.

23:59.105 --> 24:00.638
They also tend to sympathize

24:00.640 --> 24:03.107
with people who have been shot
six times.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.643
Criminally negligent homicide.

24:05.645 --> 24:07.211
She does no time.

24:07.213 --> 24:09.680
No time.

24:09.682 --> 24:12.683
Why don't we throw her
a ticker tape parade?

24:12.685 --> 24:16.053
Manslaughter one--
8-1/3 each count.

24:16.055 --> 24:20.758
It's called plea-bargaining,
not plea-scalping.

24:23.729 --> 24:25.062
Pass.

24:28.668 --> 24:30.701
The jury is not going to convict
on murder.

24:30.703 --> 24:32.736
Take a deal.

24:32.738 --> 24:33.771
Manslaughter one.

24:33.773 --> 24:35.072
Four years.

24:35.074 --> 24:36.707
ROBINETTE:
That's all she'll get anyway.

24:36.709 --> 24:38.209
This kind of case,
judges are lenient.

24:38.211 --> 24:40.678
In this kind of case, if it
really is a case of passion,

24:40.680 --> 24:42.546
a woman is weeping
into the barrel of a gun

24:42.548 --> 24:43.681
as the cops drive up.

24:43.683 --> 24:44.849
She doesn't run,
hide the gun,

24:44.851 --> 24:47.751
lie to the police,
fake alibis.

24:47.753 --> 24:49.753
Yeah, and all the
jury's going to see

24:49.755 --> 24:52.156
is a middle-aged
widow who snapped.

24:52.158 --> 24:53.190
Some widow.

24:53.192 --> 24:54.792
She's barely a wife.

24:54.794 --> 24:57.695
A few months,
the legal separation is up.

24:57.697 --> 24:59.096
Two signatures,
they're divorced.

24:59.098 --> 25:00.264
Which they weren't.

25:00.266 --> 25:01.599
Which means she inherits.

25:01.601 --> 25:02.666
That's another
motive entirely.

25:02.668 --> 25:04.235
Cullen was supposedly broke.

25:04.237 --> 25:06.070
STONE:
I need every scrap of paper
from the crime scene,

25:06.072 --> 25:08.239
Cullen's office,
Mrs. Cullen's apartment

25:08.241 --> 25:09.874
and every witness
reinterviewed.

25:09.876 --> 25:14.044
Give you five to one all you're
going to get is eyestrain.

25:14.046 --> 25:16.580
All the detectives are going
to get is sore feet.

25:16.582 --> 25:18.749
You're going to end up
exactly where you started.

25:18.751 --> 25:21.752
Wife shoots husband
in bed with lover.

25:21.754 --> 25:23.787
Take a deal.

25:23.789 --> 25:26.790
CERRETA:
Cullen sure got
a lot of mail.

25:26.792 --> 25:28.058
Here's your motive.

25:28.060 --> 25:30.628
Cullen won a million bucks.

25:30.630 --> 25:32.696
Right from Ed McMahon.

25:32.698 --> 25:36.600
Here's something from the office
of the attorney-general.

25:40.306 --> 25:42.773
Notice of sales tax violation.

25:42.775 --> 25:43.841
Hmm.

25:43.843 --> 25:45.309
Did he jaywalk, too?

25:45.311 --> 25:47.728
It's a jeweler.

25:47.729 --> 25:50.146
They don't go after people
for nickels and dimes.

25:54.320 --> 25:55.886
Eight and a quarter
percent tax.

25:55.888 --> 25:59.790
On $14,000,
that's over 1,100.

25:59.792 --> 26:02.192
My customer says to me,
"Ship a dummy box to Jersey

26:02.194 --> 26:03.794
or I'll buy my stones
in Palm Beach."

26:03.796 --> 26:05.629
What am I supposed to do?

26:05.631 --> 26:08.699
Tell them our jails are
nicer than Florida's.

26:08.701 --> 26:11.702
The state hit me
with a $100,000 fine.

26:11.704 --> 26:12.836
I love New York.

26:12.838 --> 26:13.837
Looks like
you're surviving.

26:13.839 --> 26:15.673
The record on
that necklace.

26:15.675 --> 26:17.207
Is this really important?

26:17.209 --> 26:18.909
My customer comes in again,
I want his business.

26:18.911 --> 26:20.744
If your customer
comes in again,

26:20.746 --> 26:22.146
call Geraldo.

26:22.148 --> 26:26.250
He's dead, and this is
a murder investigation.

26:32.291 --> 26:34.692
Mr. Cullen
paid cash, right?

26:34.694 --> 26:38.963
And the necklace was sent
to an Alexandra Beckett?

26:38.965 --> 26:40.731
Just barely.

26:40.733 --> 26:43.901
Mr. Cullen had bought
several pieces for his wife

26:43.903 --> 26:45.135
over the years--

26:45.137 --> 26:46.987
smaller pieces.

26:46.988 --> 26:48.838
There was a cretinous
new shipping clerk

26:48.841 --> 26:51.208
who called Mrs. Cullen
by mistake.

26:51.210 --> 26:52.843
She was not expecting
a necklace.

26:52.845 --> 26:54.745
Very embarrassing.

26:54.747 --> 26:56.146
If Mr. Cullen
had found out,

26:56.148 --> 26:57.748
it could have cost
me his business.

26:57.750 --> 27:01.785
It cost him
a lot more than that.

27:01.787 --> 27:03.287
Two motives are better than one.

27:03.288 --> 27:04.788
She knew he had money and she
knew he had a girlfriend.

27:04.790 --> 27:06.774
So she was upset.

27:06.775 --> 27:08.759
That gets her from murder
down to manslaughter.

27:08.761 --> 27:10.928
Really? She got the bad news

27:10.930 --> 27:13.230
two months
before she killed him.

27:13.232 --> 27:16.000
Every court in the state will
call that a cooling-off period.

27:16.002 --> 27:17.801
She can be provoked
more than once

27:17.803 --> 27:19.803
and still say
it's a crime of passion.

27:19.805 --> 27:21.805
Not if she planned to kill him.

27:21.807 --> 27:23.774
She found them in bed.

27:23.775 --> 27:25.742
I know to a jury,
it looks like new provocation,

27:25.745 --> 27:28.345
but what if she wasn't surprised
to see them there?

27:28.347 --> 27:30.948
What if I prove to you
that she went there to kill them

27:30.950 --> 27:33.817
and knew she could pick up a gun
on the way to the bedroom?

27:33.819 --> 27:34.918
Would that satisfy you?

27:34.920 --> 27:36.854
Would that satisfy<i> you?</i>

27:36.856 --> 27:39.289
You're splitting legal hairs.

27:39.291 --> 27:43.794
Do you sincerely believe
that Melanie Cullen went there

27:43.796 --> 27:45.829
with murder in her heart?

27:45.831 --> 27:48.766
If I have any doubts,
I'll plead her down.

27:48.768 --> 27:51.935
If not, she does 25 to life.

27:51.937 --> 27:54.038
We're still collecting
Cullen's mail.

27:54.040 --> 27:55.839
This came yesterday.

27:55.841 --> 27:59.943
"If you wish to make additional
spare copies of the keys

27:59.945 --> 28:01.979
"to your Fournier
securi-proof lock

28:01.981 --> 28:03.380
"discover the convenience

28:03.382 --> 28:05.916
of ordering
directly from the factory."

28:05.918 --> 28:08.018
So he had a key made.

28:09.321 --> 28:12.289
Somebody had a key made.

28:12.291 --> 28:14.024
Locks with thousand-dollar keys.

28:14.026 --> 28:16.393
Invent one.
I'll mint money.

28:16.395 --> 28:17.861
Fourniers,

28:17.863 --> 28:19.063
57 bucks a pop.

28:19.065 --> 28:20.998
The Cullen key?

28:31.944 --> 28:34.078
"Reason: lost original.

28:34.080 --> 28:36.814
Owner: Mrs. Edward Cullen."

28:36.816 --> 28:39.349
Mrs. Cullen?
She had an original key?

28:39.351 --> 28:40.317
Lost original.

28:40.319 --> 28:42.486
But you made her
a copy.

28:42.488 --> 28:44.788
She had the serial number.

28:44.790 --> 28:47.825
And, yes, I called the company
and checked the address

28:47.827 --> 28:48.892
on her ID.

28:48.894 --> 28:51.328
Where do you get
the serial number?

28:51.330 --> 28:52.963
It's on the registration papers.

28:52.965 --> 28:54.832
That's it?

28:54.834 --> 28:59.870
Stamped on the original keys,
but she'd lost them, right?

28:59.872 --> 29:01.338
Where did she get the number?

29:01.340 --> 29:02.823
BEN:
Fournier locks
had three keys--

29:02.824 --> 29:04.307
Cullen had one,
Alexandra Beckett had one.

29:04.310 --> 29:06.110
You think either of them gave
Mrs. Cullen the number?

29:06.112 --> 29:08.078
The son.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.414
He gave it to her,
or she helped herself.

29:11.984 --> 29:16.353
So Cullen was killed by his wife
or by his wife and son.

29:16.355 --> 29:19.123
I don't even want
to think about this.

29:19.125 --> 29:20.824
We pick him up
as an accessory--

29:20.826 --> 29:22.092
maybe even a co-conspirator.

29:22.094 --> 29:23.994
He lied, Adam.
He knows something.

29:23.996 --> 29:28.365
Frank Lehrman won't let you deal
the son against the mother.

29:28.367 --> 29:30.400
And maybe she copied
the number

29:30.402 --> 29:31.535
off her son's key.

29:31.537 --> 29:32.903
He doesn't know.

29:32.905 --> 29:34.004
We bring him the news.

29:34.006 --> 29:36.340
Suddenly sees Mom
in a new light.

29:36.342 --> 29:37.641
Don't arrest him.

29:37.642 --> 29:38.941
I have to scare him.

29:38.944 --> 29:40.694
My office or the
room at Riker's.

29:40.695 --> 29:42.445
The minute you call him,
he's going to call his mother,

29:42.448 --> 29:44.314
she's going to call
Frank Lehrman.

29:44.316 --> 29:45.849
And he's going to demand

29:45.850 --> 29:47.383
that the interview
take place in his office.

29:47.386 --> 29:48.886
You want to scare the kid?

29:48.888 --> 29:51.155
You put Cerreta and Logan
at the water cooler.

29:51.157 --> 29:55.926
If he doesn't break,
then read him his rights.

29:55.928 --> 29:57.361
Gestapo tactics, Stone?

29:57.363 --> 29:59.329
Two cops outside?

29:59.331 --> 30:00.898
Why not rubber hoses?

30:00.900 --> 30:02.866
We have reason
to believe

30:02.868 --> 30:05.569
that you are guilty
of criminal facilitation:

30:05.571 --> 30:07.070
providing your mother

30:07.072 --> 30:10.007
with the means to
murder your father.

30:10.009 --> 30:12.209
What?

30:12.210 --> 30:14.410
This is the<i> minor</i> question
you wanted to ask?

30:14.413 --> 30:16.163
You had a key

30:16.164 --> 30:17.914
to your father's apartment,
didn't you?

30:17.917 --> 30:19.416
So?

30:19.418 --> 30:21.585
She got the serial
number off of your key.

30:21.587 --> 30:25.022
She had it made or
you gave it to her.

30:25.024 --> 30:26.456
I... I didn't...

30:26.458 --> 30:28.892
She didn't have a key.

30:28.894 --> 30:31.428
A sworn statement
from the locksmith.

30:31.430 --> 30:33.397
That's it.
This interview has ended.

30:33.399 --> 30:35.165
STONE:
She didn't tell
you, did she?

30:35.167 --> 30:36.650
You don't have
to answer that.

30:36.651 --> 30:38.134
She had it made because she
planned to kill your father.

30:38.137 --> 30:40.070
No, no, that's not
what she said.

30:40.072 --> 30:42.506
No, come on, that is not
admissible. Shut up.

30:42.508 --> 30:44.408
No, you shut up. You
take your hands off him

30:44.410 --> 30:45.876
or I'll have you up on
hindering prosecution.

30:45.878 --> 30:47.945
I'm this boy's lawyer.

30:47.947 --> 30:49.513
You're his mother's lawyer.

30:49.515 --> 30:50.981
And he and his mother have
different interests.

30:50.983 --> 30:52.182
Isn't that right, Jamie?

30:52.184 --> 30:53.851
When you arrested her,

30:53.853 --> 30:58.021
she told me my dad
let her in. Okay?

30:58.023 --> 30:59.489
She was just going over there

30:59.491 --> 31:01.391
to talk about getting
back together again.

31:01.393 --> 31:04.561
She didn't know that Alexandra
was going to be there.

31:07.233 --> 31:10.133
She didn't want
to hurt anybody.

31:10.135 --> 31:13.537
She didn't... she
didn't mean to do it.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.208
That's what she said.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.210
That's what...

31:20.212 --> 31:22.613
that's what she said.

31:29.221 --> 31:31.555
MAN:
I'm not his corporate attorney.

31:31.557 --> 31:34.992
I only represented
Mr. Cullen in his divorce.

31:34.994 --> 31:36.493
What was the status
of the divorce

31:36.495 --> 31:38.161
when Mr. Cullen was killed?

31:38.163 --> 31:39.429
LEHRMAN:
Objection.

31:39.431 --> 31:41.965
The attorney-client privilege
survives death.

31:41.967 --> 31:45.002
I'm asking about documents
in the public record.

31:45.004 --> 31:47.437
On that basis only, proceed.

31:47.439 --> 31:49.506
MAN:
The separation period was up.

31:49.508 --> 31:51.441
He signed the document,
she didn't.

31:51.443 --> 31:53.410
She hit him with a dozen motions

31:53.412 --> 31:55.078
about his finances.

31:55.080 --> 31:58.248
In your expert opinion,
what does that indicate?

31:58.250 --> 31:59.449
Your Honor, is my hearing going

31:59.451 --> 32:01.585
or did Mr. Stone say
about six seconds ago

32:01.587 --> 32:04.454
that he'd only ask
about public documents?

32:04.456 --> 32:06.490
Mr. Gruen is an expert
in divorce litigation,

32:06.492 --> 32:09.326
and I am not asking about
discussions with his client.

32:09.328 --> 32:12.596
Your hearing is fine,
Mr. Lehrman. Sit down.

32:12.598 --> 32:16.166
STONE:
What does it generally mean
when one party

32:16.168 --> 32:18.402
in a divorce
makes repeated motions

32:18.404 --> 32:21.538
against
the other party's assets?

32:21.540 --> 32:23.473
She thought he was hiding money.

32:23.475 --> 32:25.442
Thank you.

32:25.444 --> 32:28.545
What did the documents
you gave Mrs. Cullen

32:28.547 --> 32:31.181
say about Mr. Cullen's
financial condition?

32:31.183 --> 32:32.582
They said
he was broke.

32:32.584 --> 32:35.185
Mr. Cullen provided
the documents.

32:35.187 --> 32:37.487
And, uh, how much
were you charging Mr. Cullen

32:37.489 --> 32:39.222
for your expert services?

32:39.224 --> 32:41.091
350 an hour.

32:41.093 --> 32:42.492
Nice work.

32:42.494 --> 32:44.594
How much did you bill him
just before he died?

32:44.596 --> 32:46.363
About $7,000.

32:46.365 --> 32:47.364
Did he pay that bill?

32:47.366 --> 32:48.365
He did.

32:48.367 --> 32:49.499
How?

32:49.501 --> 32:51.635
In cash.

32:51.637 --> 32:54.004
Alexandra Beckett
was my boss

32:54.006 --> 32:56.006
and she was my friend.

32:56.008 --> 32:59.042
Had you ever seen the defendant,
Melanie Cullen, before today?

33:00.512 --> 33:03.613
Yes, about six weeks
before Alexandra died

33:03.615 --> 33:07.317
that woman walked onto our floor
at Christie's.

33:07.319 --> 33:10.287
Alexandra stopped talking
to the customer

33:10.289 --> 33:12.589
and she went into the office.

33:12.591 --> 33:15.592
She told me she didn't want
to talk to her.

33:15.594 --> 33:18.195
Was that the first time
you'd seen the defendant?

33:18.197 --> 33:21.498
She came about two other times.

33:21.500 --> 33:24.234
Once Alexandra
was off.

33:24.236 --> 33:25.602
Once she just hid.

33:25.604 --> 33:26.336
Thank you.

33:31.210 --> 33:34.311
Do you know how Miss Beckett
met Mr. Cullen?

33:34.313 --> 33:36.546
He and his wife bought
some Japanese prints

33:36.548 --> 33:38.548
at one of her sales.

33:38.550 --> 33:41.118
So isn't it possible
that Mrs. Cullen

33:41.120 --> 33:43.420
wanted to speak to Miss Beckett
about upcoming sales?

33:43.422 --> 33:45.422
She was a collector,
wasn't she?

33:45.424 --> 33:48.291
Mrs. Cullen didn't have
any money.

33:50.662 --> 33:52.229
Did the defendant
ask specifically

33:52.231 --> 33:53.663
to see Miss Beckett's apartment?

33:53.665 --> 33:55.665
Yeah. Her, the defendant.

33:55.667 --> 33:58.335
She said she was looking
for a studio.

33:58.337 --> 34:00.203
I say, "I'm the super.

34:00.205 --> 34:02.339
You want the rental agent."

34:02.341 --> 34:04.474
Anyway, there's no vacancies.

34:04.476 --> 34:06.610
She says,
"Here's a hundred bucks."

34:06.612 --> 34:09.212
STONE:
What was the money for?

34:09.214 --> 34:12.282
SUPERINTENDENT:
She wants to see
Miss Beckett's apartment.

34:12.284 --> 34:14.317
Heard she was moving out.

34:14.319 --> 34:17.554
I said, "Maybe, but not
for a couple months yet."

34:17.556 --> 34:19.523
She says, "Here's 200."

34:19.525 --> 34:21.525
I wouldn't show her.

34:21.527 --> 34:23.326
Thank you.

34:25.230 --> 34:28.198
Mr. Kolvino, hasn't anybody
ever paid you

34:28.200 --> 34:30.634
to look at an apartment before?

34:30.636 --> 34:33.570
Sure, but not in this market.

34:35.107 --> 34:36.540
You almost feel sorry for her.

34:36.542 --> 34:38.642
SCHIFF:
I trust the key word
is "almost."

34:38.644 --> 34:40.477
Paul, two months
after my divorce,

34:40.479 --> 34:42.412
I wanted to kill my wife.
I didn't.

34:42.414 --> 34:45.282
SCHIFF:
50% of the marriages
end in divorce.

34:45.284 --> 34:46.450
Everybody starts shooting,

34:46.452 --> 34:48.485
a quarter of the population
is dead.

34:48.487 --> 34:50.220
Don't count on that jury.

34:50.222 --> 34:52.689
But my premeditation case--
halfway there.

34:52.691 --> 34:55.725
The son testifies,
Melanie Cullen is gone.

34:58.630 --> 35:02.232
Two years on the job.

35:02.234 --> 35:03.600
My first murder case.

35:03.602 --> 35:06.736
I said to myself, "The jury will
be out in 30 minutes.

35:06.738 --> 35:08.638
Guilty."

35:08.640 --> 35:10.373
And a day later

35:10.375 --> 35:12.142
they acquitted.

35:12.144 --> 35:14.678
Six days. They convicted.

35:14.680 --> 35:16.546
A lousy six days.

35:16.548 --> 35:19.149
(<i> phone ringing</i> )

35:19.151 --> 35:22.185
Yes?

35:23.555 --> 35:26.156
Tell him he'll call him back.

35:26.158 --> 35:27.757
Thank you.

35:29.561 --> 35:31.661
Lehrman wants to talk.

35:31.663 --> 35:34.664
You get a decent deal, take it.

35:34.666 --> 35:37.567
Manslaughter two. One count.

35:37.569 --> 35:39.503
Two dead bodies. Two counts.

35:39.505 --> 35:41.271
Manslaughter one. 15 Years.

35:41.273 --> 35:44.708
Maybe the jury believes
she was following Miss Beckett,

35:44.710 --> 35:47.744
but she was acting crazy
when she did it.

35:47.746 --> 35:49.546
Six years.

35:51.450 --> 35:53.750
12 years. End of conversation.

35:53.752 --> 35:56.286
Look, you're not going
to get anyplace...

35:56.288 --> 35:57.687
Melanie...

35:57.689 --> 36:00.290
Please...

36:00.292 --> 36:02.559
12 years in jail?

36:02.561 --> 36:05.395
I'd be an old woman.

36:05.397 --> 36:07.397
That's more

36:07.399 --> 36:09.633
than Alexandra Beckett will be.

36:09.635 --> 36:15.705
I gave him my life
and he just threw it away.

36:15.707 --> 36:21.578
Look, I am not a used piece
of furniture, Mr. Stone.

36:21.580 --> 36:24.614
I'm not some end table
that you replace

36:24.616 --> 36:28.752
because it gets nicks and chips
and the styles change.

36:28.754 --> 36:31.521
And so you shot your husband.

36:37.596 --> 36:40.697
I hadn't planned to kill him.

36:40.699 --> 36:43.366
You know what, Mrs. Cullen?

36:43.368 --> 36:45.869
I don't believe you.

36:49.374 --> 36:52.342
There are women on the jury.

36:52.344 --> 36:54.744
They'll believe me.

36:54.746 --> 36:58.582
I won't be a victim anymore.

37:04.256 --> 37:07.257
STONE:
Did she tell you
how she killed him?

37:07.259 --> 37:11.294
She knew my father's gun
was in the dresser.

37:11.296 --> 37:13.630
STONE:
Did you have a key
to your father's apartment?

37:13.632 --> 37:16.366
Yes.

37:16.368 --> 37:18.768
Did you ever give that key

37:18.770 --> 37:20.437
to your mother?

37:22.608 --> 37:24.341
No.

37:24.343 --> 37:25.709
She had her own.

37:28.413 --> 37:29.913
What?

37:42.361 --> 37:43.793
You are under oath,
Mr. Cullen.

37:43.795 --> 37:47.530
My father told me
to give her the serial number

37:47.532 --> 37:49.599
so she could make a copy

37:49.601 --> 37:52.636
so she could move out
the rest of her things

37:52.638 --> 37:54.337
whenever she wanted.

37:58.577 --> 38:00.343
Recess, Your Honor.

38:00.345 --> 38:01.444
Recess. Ten minutes.

38:01.446 --> 38:02.779
(<i> bangs gavel</i> )

38:09.488 --> 38:10.487
She got to him.

38:10.489 --> 38:11.554
She's his mother.

38:11.556 --> 38:12.922
I don't know
who to slam first--

38:12.924 --> 38:14.691
the kid for perjury
or Lehrman for suborning.

38:14.693 --> 38:16.426
He gave us the gun--
without his testimony,

38:16.428 --> 38:17.878
we didn't have
a murder weapon.

38:17.879 --> 38:19.329
Without the key, we've
got no premeditation.

38:19.331 --> 38:20.931
Look, go easy, Ben.

38:20.932 --> 38:22.532
To the jury, he's half way
to being an orphan.

38:22.534 --> 38:23.700
You're trying
to finish the job.

38:23.702 --> 38:24.801
Please, just get
the deposition.

38:26.838 --> 38:28.838
"I didn't know my mother
had a..."

38:28.840 --> 38:30.807
Louder, Mr. Cullen.

38:30.809 --> 38:33.710
"If she copied my key,
she did so

38:33.712 --> 38:35.612
without my knowledge."

38:35.614 --> 38:36.846
Did you sign that?

38:36.848 --> 38:38.581
I said what you wanted.
You confused me.

38:38.583 --> 38:40.717
Confused you? How old
are you, Mr. Cullen?

38:40.719 --> 38:42.852
Twenty-two.
And when did you
graduate from college?

38:42.854 --> 38:44.421
My father was murdered.

38:44.423 --> 38:45.522
You brought
policemen with you.

38:45.523 --> 38:46.622
You said you were
going to arrest me

38:46.625 --> 38:47.924
if I didn't say
what you wanted to hear.

38:47.926 --> 38:50.860
STONE:
That has nothing to do
with the proceedings.

38:50.862 --> 38:53.463
Now what? You want to put
Cerreta and Logan on the stand?

38:53.465 --> 38:54.931
They're going to say
sure they were there,

38:54.933 --> 38:56.466
they were smiling
the whole time.

38:56.468 --> 38:57.500
I shouldn't have taken them.

38:57.502 --> 38:58.702
You wanted to arrest the kid.

38:58.704 --> 39:00.370
It would look terrific
to a jury.

39:00.372 --> 39:01.955
They'll convict you.

39:01.956 --> 39:03.539
Why if we put Lehrman
on the stand?

39:03.542 --> 39:04.874
He's not the kid's attorney,

39:04.876 --> 39:06.609
and I don't think
he'd perjure himself.

39:06.611 --> 39:07.877
Oh, that's beautiful.

39:07.879 --> 39:10.013
A defense attorney as a witness.

39:10.015 --> 39:11.481
Judge Becky Stein.

39:11.483 --> 39:13.750
Not going to happen.
Let it drop.

39:13.752 --> 39:15.618
Lehrman's changed
his witness list.

39:15.620 --> 39:17.420
Mrs. Cullen's up first.

39:17.422 --> 39:18.939
Oh, great.

39:18.940 --> 39:20.457
Get out your handkerchiefs.

39:21.026 --> 39:24.761
I just went over
to talk to him.

39:24.763 --> 39:27.497
I thought things
were getting better.

39:27.499 --> 39:31.735
I thought we might
get back together.

39:31.737 --> 39:34.771
We had 25 years.

39:34.773 --> 39:37.040
You knew he'd been
seeing someone else?

39:37.042 --> 39:38.775
A little fling.

39:38.777 --> 39:40.477
Men do that.

39:40.479 --> 39:43.513
But you did not know

39:43.515 --> 39:45.415
she would be there?

39:45.417 --> 39:46.516
No.

39:46.518 --> 39:49.052
And then I saw her in my...

39:52.524 --> 39:54.457
in my bed.

39:54.459 --> 39:57.994
She told me to get out

39:57.996 --> 40:00.430
of<i> my</i> bedroom.

40:00.432 --> 40:02.532
And I saw my...

40:04.803 --> 40:07.604
I knew it was all over.

40:07.606 --> 40:08.872
I'd been kidding myself.

40:08.874 --> 40:13.009
Over-the-hill, middle-aged woman
kidding herself

40:13.011 --> 40:17.847
and this young, rich girl
looking at me.

40:17.849 --> 40:20.884
I felt so pathetic.

40:20.886 --> 40:24.754
So pathetic!

40:24.756 --> 40:28.725
I wanted to kill myself.

40:28.727 --> 40:30.927
That's all...

40:32.497 --> 40:35.064
that's all I remember.

40:35.066 --> 40:36.533
I'm sorry.

40:36.535 --> 40:38.635
I'm so sorry.

40:44.009 --> 40:45.775
Your witness.

40:55.754 --> 40:58.688
Mrs. Cullen...

40:58.690 --> 41:01.624
Mrs. Cullen?

41:01.626 --> 41:03.960
How many times
did you shoot them?

41:03.962 --> 41:05.562
I don't remember.

41:08.733 --> 41:13.736
Do you remember asking your son
to lie the night of the murder?

41:13.738 --> 41:15.138
I was afraid.

41:15.140 --> 41:17.607
I'm sorry.

41:17.609 --> 41:22.545
Do you remember asking your son
to lie for you at this trial?

41:25.016 --> 41:28.818
I told him to tell the truth.

41:33.758 --> 41:35.725
Nothing matters.

41:37.062 --> 41:39.562
Nothing matters anymore.

41:44.536 --> 41:46.035
You want to do what?

41:46.037 --> 41:47.770
Juries like to compromise.

41:47.772 --> 41:50.039
If they can choose between
murder two, manslaughter

41:50.041 --> 41:51.774
or acquittal,
they'll choose manslaughter.

41:51.776 --> 41:53.710
Good. She'll go to prison.

41:55.780 --> 41:57.547
For four years.

41:57.549 --> 41:59.148
For two deaths.

41:59.150 --> 42:01.718
If we drop
the manslaughter charge

42:01.720 --> 42:03.052
they'll pick murder.

42:03.054 --> 42:04.554
25 to life.

42:04.556 --> 42:05.788
Or they'll acquit.

42:05.790 --> 42:07.056
She's a cold-blooded killer.

42:07.058 --> 42:08.157
She could walk.

42:08.159 --> 42:09.792
My case has made premeditation.

42:09.794 --> 42:11.127
The jury won't let that happen.

42:11.129 --> 42:15.064
Pride goeth before a fall.

42:15.066 --> 42:18.868
I'll send you flowers
in the intensive care unit.

42:23.942 --> 42:25.808
I can't do it, Ben.

42:25.810 --> 42:27.777
The evidence cuts both ways.

42:27.779 --> 42:29.946
It is within
our discretion,

42:29.948 --> 42:32.048
so the people request
the manslaughter counts

42:32.050 --> 42:34.083
not be submitted
to the jury.

42:34.085 --> 42:37.220
You drop manslaughter
and the jury convicts on murder

42:37.222 --> 42:38.721
automatic appeal.

42:38.723 --> 42:40.623
STONE:
Not if you don't object.

42:40.625 --> 42:43.192
I am representing Mrs. Cullen.

42:43.194 --> 42:45.995
If the jury believes her and
the manslaughter counts are gone

42:45.997 --> 42:47.096
she goes home
tomorrow afternoon.

42:47.098 --> 42:49.699
If he accepts this, Ben

42:49.701 --> 42:52.068
I'm going to make it
absolutely clear

42:52.070 --> 42:55.204
they must believe
beyond a scintilla of doubt

42:55.206 --> 42:57.840
that she committed
premeditated murder

42:57.842 --> 42:59.108
or they acquit.

43:00.979 --> 43:03.112
Beyond a scintilla?

43:03.114 --> 43:05.915
A mini-scintilla.

43:10.689 --> 43:13.823
Was Mrs. Cullen confused,
emotional, suicidal?

43:13.825 --> 43:17.026
This is what Melanie Cullen did.

43:17.028 --> 43:19.062
She stalked Alexandra Beckett.

43:19.064 --> 43:22.031
She had a key made
to the new lock

43:22.033 --> 43:24.901
on Edward Cullen's apartment.

43:24.903 --> 43:27.770
She went there after dark
and let herself in.

43:27.772 --> 43:31.174
She helped herself
to the gun

43:31.176 --> 43:32.976
that she knew was there.

43:34.879 --> 43:36.879
She ran away.

43:36.881 --> 43:38.881
She disposed of the gun.

43:38.883 --> 43:42.752
She convinced her son
to give her a phony alibi.

43:42.754 --> 43:45.755
She lied to the police.

43:45.757 --> 43:48.791
She lied to her son.

43:48.793 --> 43:50.860
She lied to you.

43:52.831 --> 43:55.698
She shot and killed two people

43:55.700 --> 44:01.304
in an act
of cold and calculated murder.

44:04.976 --> 44:07.944
Don't let her get away with it.

44:12.917 --> 44:14.250
The question is not whether

44:14.252 --> 44:18.254
the defendant killed
Mr. Cullen and Miss Beckett.

44:18.256 --> 44:20.990
The only question
for you to resolve

44:20.992 --> 44:23.893
is that of her state of mind.

44:23.895 --> 44:28.164
You must find,
beyond any reasonable doubt

44:28.166 --> 44:30.166
that she did not act

44:30.168 --> 44:35.938
under the influence of
extreme emotional disturbance.

44:35.940 --> 44:39.275
You must find that she did
intend with premeditation

44:39.277 --> 44:41.210
to cause the deaths

44:41.212 --> 44:43.846
of two people

44:43.848 --> 44:46.949
or you must find her not guilty.

44:48.787 --> 44:53.256
Never seen you
like this before.

44:53.258 --> 44:57.326
I have never done anything
this potentially stupid before.

44:57.328 --> 44:59.862
I just pray to god

44:59.864 --> 45:03.266
that when I get out of here,
I'm not competing

45:03.268 --> 45:06.002
with Melanie Cullen
for an uptown cab.

45:06.004 --> 45:10.139
The jury just finished dinner
catered from Walter's.

45:10.141 --> 45:13.142
Hope you don't have
a lousy six days.

45:13.144 --> 45:15.878
Well, it's four hours.
It's already lousy.

45:15.880 --> 45:17.113
Good night, gentlemen.

45:17.115 --> 45:18.247
Good night.

45:18.249 --> 45:20.316
(<i> phone ringing</i> )

45:26.758 --> 45:28.858
Stone.

45:32.297 --> 45:34.030
Just a minute.

45:34.032 --> 45:36.032
(<i> presses hold button</i> )

45:36.034 --> 45:37.300
It's Lehrman.

45:37.302 --> 45:39.769
He's pacing, too.

45:39.771 --> 45:42.004
He'll take two counts
of man one.

45:42.006 --> 45:43.873
She'll do
nine years.

45:43.875 --> 45:44.874
It's more than four.

45:44.876 --> 45:46.943
Less than 25.

45:50.849 --> 45:52.281
Your case.

45:52.283 --> 45:54.383
And my stomach.

46:00.425 --> 46:02.391
Deal.

46:06.164 --> 46:08.831
Your role was no less crucial

46:08.833 --> 46:10.933
because your verdict
was not required.

46:10.935 --> 46:12.201
I thank you.

46:12.203 --> 46:13.903
You are excused.

46:19.911 --> 46:22.912
Your Honor,
move to continue bail

46:22.914 --> 46:24.413
until sentencing.

46:24.415 --> 46:26.415
Motion to continue granted.

46:26.417 --> 46:28.684
(<i> bangs gavel</i> )

46:28.685 --> 46:30.952
MAN:
Ten minutes later,
it would have been murder.

46:30.955 --> 46:32.321
We were voting.

46:32.323 --> 46:35.958
The way she used her son
made us all furious.

46:35.960 --> 46:37.326
If only the kid
hadn't lied.

46:37.328 --> 46:39.195
If your mother
killed your father...

46:39.197 --> 46:40.196
I wouldn't have lied.

46:40.198 --> 46:41.230
What's she up to?

46:41.232 --> 46:43.065
Rehearsing
for the parole board.

46:43.067 --> 46:45.067
I don't know what happened.

46:45.069 --> 46:46.335
I don't remember.

46:46.337 --> 46:49.071
I went there
to talk to Eddie.

46:49.073 --> 46:51.941
I thought everything
would be all right

46:51.943 --> 46:54.377
and that we could
work everything out.

46:54.379 --> 46:56.946
We were married for 25 years.

46:56.948 --> 46:59.348
I thought everything
would be all right.

46:59.350 --> 47:01.884
I've always loved Eddie.

47:01.886 --> 47:04.020
<i> I've always loved Eddie...</i>
