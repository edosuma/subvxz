00:04.740 --> 00:06.219
Ivan- Last night was amazing.

00:06.260 --> 00:09.218
My heart not in this.
We're meant for other people.

00:09.270 --> 00:10.828
Mother?
What happened?

00:10.880 --> 00:12.563
A possible miscarriage.

00:12.620 --> 00:14.303
Everything's going
to be alright.

00:14.360 --> 00:17.830
The_trL_ith is bullets meant
be thzzmg at my men's head
in a month.

00:17.880 --> 00:20.667
And I have no idea how
to keep them alive.

00:20.710 --> 00:22.496
Your fianc may
not be a war hero.

00:22.540 --> 00:24.622
I saw your friend
taking a nip.

00:24.670 --> 00:27.844
What am I suppose to do about
it?
Church may do her some
good.

00:27.890 --> 00:31.360
Child of God should be able to
grieve her fathers death.

00:31.420 --> 00:32.546
Me? I feel nothing.

00:32.590 --> 00:33.761
Eugene!

00:33.810 --> 00:35.858
Surprise, Ma.

00:35.900 --> 00:37.504
Were you discharged?

00:37.550 --> 00:40.075
Even better. Ace Gunner
promoted to Sergeant.

00:40.120 --> 00:42.509
You hear that Bob?
Gene's a Sergeant.

00:42.560 --> 00:44.255
Some kind of miracle.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.604
You can drag a hoof!

00:54.660 --> 00:55.479
I've been practicing.

00:55.530 --> 00:56.690
Oh is that right?

00:56.750 --> 00:58.570
Who's my little sister
been seein'?

00:58.620 --> 01:00.576
She needs to see the
butcher before work!

01:00.620 --> 01:02.178
We're not rationing
meat, mom.

01:02.230 --> 01:04.186
He won't run out of
rib roasts.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.835
No, but I need the
biggest one he has.

01:06.890 --> 01:08.881
Relax, Midget.
It's just a meal.

01:08.930 --> 01:10.454
A meal in your honour.

01:10.500 --> 01:12.889
I don't need a bunch of
people sitting around

01:12.940 --> 01:14.896
chewing food to
make me feel good.

01:14.940 --> 01:18.114
You're a war hero, Gene, and
I want to show you off.

01:18.160 --> 01:20.116
Maybe Gene can help
with the errands?

01:20.160 --> 01:22.628
Oh no. It's his big appearance
at the factory today.

01:22.690 --> 01:25.113
Harold agreed to let you
parade Gene through work?

01:25.170 --> 01:28.606
It's no "parade", he's
discussing air-raid survival
at my life-skills seminar.

01:28.650 --> 01:31.699
About that, Ma. I've barely
seen action on the ground.

01:31.740 --> 01:34.379
I'm mostly in the air with
the men, doing the damage.

01:34.440 --> 01:35.862
No backing out.
You promised.

01:35.920 --> 01:37.911
Mom remember, I'm bringing
a friend tonight.

01:37.960 --> 01:39.006
Fine, dear.

01:40.620 --> 01:43.578
So when's your "victory lap"
start?

01:43.620 --> 01:46.441
Next week. And it's
no "Victory lap."

01:46.490 --> 01:47.798
Just a couple
weeks training...

01:47.840 --> 01:50.752
And then they trundle you
off around the country,

01:50.800 --> 01:52.404
poster child for
selling war bonds.

01:52.460 --> 01:55.145
I'm a poster child because
I earned my stripes.

01:55.200 --> 01:57.236
I made Ace Gunner
In record tIme.

01:57.290 --> 01:59.633
Just wait till we start
seeing sustained combat.

01:59.680 --> 02:01.898
Who looks forward to
sustained combat?

02:01.940 --> 02:03.851
I'm not afraid to
do my duty.

02:03.900 --> 02:08.724
You better be careful
what you wish for, Son.

02:08.780 --> 02:10.907
Three German prisoners of
war have escaped
[Radio]

02:10.950 --> 02:13.168
from camp in Bowmanville.
[Radio]

02:13.220 --> 02:15.780
Members of the public are
instructed to use utmost
Vigilance [Radio]

02:15.830 --> 02:18.788
in aiding in their re-capture.
These men maybe armed.
[Radio]

02:18.830 --> 02:20.866
German prisoners
on Canadian soil?

02:20.920 --> 02:24.139
I'm sure they brought back
hundreds, most of them
are officers.

02:24.180 --> 02:26.091
Waste of time,
keeping them alive.

02:26.140 --> 02:30.179
The only good Nazi
is a dead Nazi.

02:37.590 --> 02:39.455
Your honey's in
England now?

02:39.500 --> 02:41.582
Risking the
Baedeker bombings?

02:43.590 --> 02:44.852
He's in London.

02:44.900 --> 02:46.197
The only "bombing"
James risks

02:46.250 --> 02:48.980
is when the curtain rises
on a West End play.

02:49.030 --> 02:51.851
He wrote me how
he woke up with a

02:51.910 --> 02:53.559
"big head" from last
night's "battle."

02:53.600 --> 02:55.386
He isn't entitled
to some fun?

02:55.430 --> 02:57.159
All those rumours
about what soldiers

02:57.220 --> 02:59.688
get up to in that city
in their spare time.

02:59.740 --> 03:01.640
There's no point letting
your mind go there.

03:01.700 --> 03:04.692
You sound like you'd rather
he were on the front lines.

03:04.740 --> 03:05.820
Of course not.

03:05.880 --> 03:07.825
It's just, all these
faceless fears,

03:07.880 --> 03:09.097
it's so much to bear.

03:09.140 --> 03:11.836
My fear's got a face
and it's no easier.

03:11.880 --> 03:13.575
Still worried about
running into Ivan?

03:13.620 --> 03:16.225
He just looks at me
with those sad eyes.

03:16.280 --> 03:17.759
Kate - Well, he was
smitten with you.

03:17.800 --> 03:19.791
Ending things was an
act of kindness.

03:19.850 --> 03:22.751
There's no dignity in
carrying a torch for a girl

03:22.810 --> 03:24.414
who doesn't love you back.

03:24.460 --> 03:28.760
Some girls have nobody and here
are you two, complaining!

03:28.810 --> 03:30.243
What's up with her today?

03:30.290 --> 03:32.019
Still getting used
to being back.

03:32.080 --> 03:35.550
Maybe we should have
a girls' night in, play cards?

03:35.600 --> 03:37.556
Yeah.

03:37.600 --> 03:40.865
Hey, Ivan just needs
space and time.

03:40.910 --> 03:43.037
Just keep your distance
until his feelings diminish.

03:43.090 --> 03:45.820
Maybe then you can
be friends again.

03:48.480 --> 03:49.879
You wrote this?

03:49.920 --> 03:52.354
Did you know it was
the War Department

03:52.400 --> 03:55.221
who asked Veronica Lake
to wear her hair "up"?

03:55.270 --> 03:57.659
Copy deadline
was an hour ago.

03:57.710 --> 03:59.098
You didn't even read it.

03:59.150 --> 04:01.232
The Victory Beacon is
an employee newsletter,

04:01.280 --> 04:02.884
not a Hollywood tabloid.

04:02.930 --> 04:05.069
"Most" girls want to
look like Miss Lake.

04:05.110 --> 04:07.237
I've told them how
to in this article,

04:07.290 --> 04:08.803
so they can work safe.

04:08.850 --> 04:11.375
It's no doubt a topic
close to your heart.

04:11.420 --> 04:12.546
Yes. And my scalp.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.465
Nevertheless, I
edit the Beacon.

04:14.510 --> 04:17.377
You can't just seize control
of everything in this office.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.387
Each home needs an
"Emergency Refuge Room"

04:22.430 --> 04:25.775
with drinking water,
soup, milk,

04:25.830 --> 04:27.036
glucose, cookies, tea...

04:27.090 --> 04:30.651
Leon left this for you.

04:30.700 --> 04:34.352
Pastimes are important:
battery radio,

04:34.400 --> 04:37.779
toys for children, and
cards for the older folk...

04:37.840 --> 04:39.705
Pinch me if I nod off.

04:39.750 --> 04:42.878
I'd stay awake, if I were you.
You never know.

04:42.930 --> 04:44.272
Escaped Nazis.

04:44.320 --> 04:47.539
In the event of a bombing,
the key is to stay calm

04:47.590 --> 04:49.194
and exit the affected area.

04:49.240 --> 04:51.845
So I can come in
and save the day!

04:51.900 --> 04:54.630
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Sgt. Eugene Corbett.

04:54.680 --> 05:04.646
[Clapping]

05:06.000 --> 05:08.252
Now London was still smarting

05:08.300 --> 05:10.905
from the hell-fires Fritz
rained down over Christmas.

05:10.960 --> 05:13.087
It was torn up pretty bad.

05:13.130 --> 05:17.749
So the boys and I; we
decided to unwind.

05:17.790 --> 05:20.918
I picked up a dish
at Rainbow Corner,

05:20.970 --> 05:23.097
it's this spot in Piccadilly
Circus where soldiers

05:23.140 --> 05:24.960
looking for a good time,

05:25.020 --> 05:27.534
find the girls to lift
their spirits up.

05:27.580 --> 05:30.799
Gene, I don't think this
is a type of story they
came to hear.

05:30.850 --> 05:32.806
Speak for yourself!

05:32.850 --> 05:35.580
I tell you, there's no worse
time for Wailing Willy

05:35.630 --> 05:38.929
to sing out than when
you're getting a private
burlesque show!

05:38.990 --> 05:40.639
The whole block shook.

05:40.680 --> 05:44.559
We looked down and there was a
1 K incendiary at our feet.

05:44.600 --> 05:47.068
I dunno if you build
this device here,

05:47.120 --> 05:49.907
but it burns through
brick like it's paper.

05:49.950 --> 05:53.124
So I said, I'll take care
of the fire

05:53.170 --> 05:56.128
if you take care of
that strip-tease!

05:56.180 --> 05:59.650
[Cheers and clapping]

05:59.700 --> 06:02.874
Excuse me sorry, I
thought we were here

06:02.920 --> 06:05.093
to learn how to_survive
a bomb-raid?

06:05.140 --> 06:07.483
Can you learn how
to be lucky?

06:07.540 --> 06:09.223
'Cause from where
I usually Sit,

06:09.280 --> 06:13.148
that's all it comes down to.

06:13.190 --> 06:15.192
But I will say this.

06:15.240 --> 06:20.803
If you carry a girl and her
cat down nine flights of
crumbling, burning stairs,

06:20.850 --> 06:24.377
you'll learn things that
make burlesque seem like
a puppet show.

06:24.420 --> 06:27.890
[Cheering and clapping]

06:27.950 --> 06:31.852
Is there a_ soldier alive
not treating this war
like a giant party?

06:33.650 --> 06:36.084
Marco Moretti, I'm a
friend of your mother's.

06:36.130 --> 06:38.030
Pleasure to meet
a real live hero.

06:38.090 --> 06:39.990
Yeah. Marco. Nice to meet you.

06:40.050 --> 06:42.006
You coming to the
big affair tonight?

06:42.050 --> 06:44.086
Ah, no, he's just
a co-worker.

06:44.140 --> 06:46.700
Are you enlisted,
Mr. Moretti?

06:46.750 --> 06:47.910
I'm working on it.

06:47.970 --> 06:49.096
Work harder.

06:49.140 --> 06:51.745
We need all the strong
men we can get.

06:51.800 --> 06:52.835
Except for Italians?

06:52.890 --> 06:53.959
Being strong isn't
always good enough.

06:54.020 --> 06:55.533
That's bunk.

06:55.580 --> 06:57.309
There_'s Italian_
fellows in my unit,

06:57.370 --> 06:59.838
I trust with my life.

06:59.890 --> 07:01.972
I just loved
your speech.

07:02.030 --> 07:04.715
It was like I was in
that room with you.

07:04.770 --> 07:06.453
That could be arranged.

07:06.510 --> 07:09.149
Didn't mean like that,
but...

07:09.210 --> 07:12.077
weren't you afraid with
the building on fire?

07:12.120 --> 07:15.726
Shall we rescue poor Kate
from our Canteen Cowboy?

07:15.780 --> 07:17.907
I believe she's
trying to flirt.

07:17.950 --> 07:19.736
Is that what
you call that?

07:19.780 --> 07:22.089
Oh Gladys, Daughters
of the Empire

07:22.130 --> 07:25.088
are stuffing ditty bags for
soldiers at the club tonight

07:25.140 --> 07:26.949
_and we're all to
bring an extra hand.

07:27.010 --> 07:28.614
I can't, we're playing cards.

07:28.660 --> 07:31.049
Betty- I don't mind,
if we cancel.

07:31.100 --> 07:32.829
Sorry, Carol, but
really right now,

07:32.880 --> 07:35.007
I don't feel like sending
combs to soldiers

07:35.060 --> 07:36.789
making time at Rainbow Corner!

07:40.060 --> 07:42.938
If you want, I can
do ditty bags?

07:42.980 --> 07:44.880
You want your article
printed that badly?

07:44.940 --> 07:46.896
If we're going to work
together, Carol.

07:46.940 --> 07:48.805
We meant as try
to get along?

07:48.850 --> 07:51.023
Well what about your
big card game?

07:51.070 --> 07:55.029
Well it gets trumped by
getting to see what goes
on in your fancy club.

07:55.080 --> 07:56.593
There is somewhat of
a dress code.

07:56.650 --> 07:58.333
Well I can rustle
something up.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.823
Need more butter
for these potatoes.

08:04.870 --> 08:08.169
Mom we've used up the butter
coupon for the whole month.

08:08.220 --> 08:09.869
Didn't ask for lip,
just butter.

08:09.920 --> 08:12.229
I've seen cluster-bombs
make less mess.

08:12.270 --> 08:14.352
You might want to
grab a broom.

08:14.400 --> 08:16.004
Hey it's Bride of Frankenstein!

08:16.060 --> 08:19.700
Don't be a pest.

08:19.760 --> 08:25.448
What's the matter if I eat
my share now or later,
what's it matter?

08:25.500 --> 08:30.369
Alright, Aikins' favourite,
by request.

08:30.420 --> 08:32.980
Liquor permit book's
looking well-worn.

08:33.030 --> 08:35.726
Let me help.

08:35.770 --> 08:37.897
Why are you doing
this to yourself?

08:37.950 --> 08:41.033
Family and friends want to see
Gene before he ships out.

08:41.080 --> 08:42.160
You invited Harold Aikins.

08:42.210 --> 08:44.166
Since when is your boss
ourfnend?

08:44.210 --> 08:46.997
Bob, I'm a proud mother.
Let me have my moment.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.644
The boy's seen action.

08:48.700 --> 08:52.170
He needs rest, not the
world putting him on show.

08:52.220 --> 08:54.563
War doesn't always
have to break a man.

08:54.620 --> 08:59.000
Gene's war isn't over yet.

08:59.060 --> 09:01.483
Let me know when you
want me to carve.

09:01.540 --> 09:06.364
I was thinking maybe Gene
could take the knife tonight.

09:06.410 --> 09:10.403
Indulge me, Bob.
I'd appreciate it.

09:10.460 --> 09:12.280
Is everybody decent?!

09:12.330 --> 09:15.106
Ellie, come on in.

09:15.160 --> 09:17.936
Good Lord what an unholy mess.

09:17.990 --> 09:21.118
Go put your face on, Lorna.
I'll sort things out.

09:21.160 --> 09:24.982
You too Bob, I need space
to work.

09:25.040 --> 09:26.598
Thank you Ellie.

09:26.650 --> 09:28.129
Where to begin?

09:28.170 --> 09:31.082
Ah, yes indeedy.

09:34.920 --> 09:36.433
You're late!

09:36.480 --> 09:39.131
Sorry. This place has higher
security than our factory does.

09:39.180 --> 09:42.092
Well we've already started,
so let's dig in.

09:48.890 --> 09:51.233
Seems _|ike a stalled
mi55ion to me.

09:51.280 --> 09:55.546
Normally we wait for some of the
more established ladies to
take the lead.

09:55.590 --> 09:56.670
Mrs. Beaverton.

09:56.720 --> 09:58.506
Here I am rubbing elbows...

09:58.550 --> 10:00.632
Don't you dare touch
anyone's elbows.

10:00.680 --> 10:02.853
Carol, if you don't
want me to be here...

10:02.900 --> 10:04.413
I do.

10:04.470 --> 10:08.110
Just promise me you'll take my
lead, and keep your head down.

10:08.170 --> 10:13.255
Well thank you, good-bye.

10:13.300 --> 10:14.255
Did you reach him?

10:14.300 --> 10:16.302
Apparently he's on
two-day leave.

10:16.350 --> 10:18.170
Which means he could
be anywhere.

10:18.220 --> 10:21.565
So he can't check in,
he's fighting a war.

10:21.620 --> 10:23.702
I'm too cold to care right now,

10:23.750 --> 10:25.832
I swear I just saw my breath.

10:25.880 --> 10:28.189
Mrs. Groot shuts the
furnace down April first,

10:28.230 --> 10:29.743
come hell or cold weather.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.188
So fire it back up.

10:31.230 --> 10:34.666
Shakespeare called this
"a nipping and eager air"

10:34.720 --> 10:39.714
Yeah? My dad called this
"freezing the balls off
a brass monkey."

10:39.760 --> 10:41.284
Where are you going?

10:41.330 --> 10:43.025
I thought we were
playing cards.

10:43.070 --> 10:45.721
We are. I just have to
drop something off.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.761
She's a mystery
these days.

10:50.730 --> 10:53.164
Did you at least
bring any hooch?

10:53.210 --> 10:58.079
Bubbly's harder to come
by without access to my
father's supply.

10:58.130 --> 10:59.859
Well that settles it.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.126
You're leaving too?

11:01.180 --> 11:05.264
No, but I am cranking
up the damn furnace.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.311
What a lovely home.

11:09.360 --> 11:13.182
They put up police checkpoints,
looking for the escaped Krauts.

11:13.230 --> 11:14.663
Minnie, this is Lorna Corbett.

11:14.710 --> 11:16.234
A pleasure.

11:16.280 --> 11:18.623
That's carrot,
cabbage and lime.

11:18.670 --> 11:20.490
So where's the guest
of honour?

11:20.540 --> 11:23.327
He gave us such a
boost at work today.

11:23.370 --> 11:24.803
I heard all about it.

11:24.850 --> 11:28.195
Do you think he could speak
to us at the Praise Pals?

11:28.250 --> 11:30.639
That's Minnie's church-group.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.204
Oh. Gene would be thrilled.

11:33.250 --> 11:35.161
Make yourself at home.

11:40.910 --> 11:43.640
Go put on your shirt
and greet our guests.

11:43.700 --> 11:46.999
And please, tonight less
boasting about your
romantic conquests?

11:47.050 --> 11:48.950
It's your party.

11:49.010 --> 11:51.706
Tell them about your
promotion. People want to have
good news right now.

11:51.750 --> 11:53.263
Yes, ma'am. Yes ma'am.

11:59.320 --> 12:01.276
Mom, you have a second?

12:01.320 --> 12:02.275
What is it now?

12:02.330 --> 12:05.106
My date wants to say hello.

12:05.150 --> 12:06.492
Your "date"?

12:06.550 --> 12:12.762
Dr. Narendra Patel, meet,
or re-meet, my mother.

12:12.810 --> 12:15.244
We uh, you were
at the hospital.

12:15.290 --> 12:16.814
Yes. Call me "Ned."

12:16.860 --> 12:20.899
Thank you for inviting me,
Mrs. Corbett.

12:20.950 --> 12:23.032
You two, work together.

12:23.090 --> 12:25.558
We eat together in
the cafeteria.

12:25.610 --> 12:27.168
Soup and stale saltines,

12:27.220 --> 12:29.393
the only supper we
normally have time for.

12:29.440 --> 12:33.137
I can't tell you how
much I'm looking forward
to a home-cooked meal.

12:33.180 --> 12:37.139
I'll see that you're
well-fed tonight.

12:37.190 --> 12:39.829
That Minnie Aikins is
a real laugh-riot.

12:39.880 --> 12:42.440
What am I going do with
that awful thing?

12:42.500 --> 12:45.492
Well, the war department's
asking for old rubber.

12:45.540 --> 12:46.666
[Laughing]

12:50.810 --> 12:54.450
I made "Ace" after squaring five
"confirmed kills" from my Wimpy.

12:54.510 --> 12:56.239
That's his Wellington.
His airplane.

12:56.290 --> 13:00.420
How do you "confirm"
from up in the air?

13:00.470 --> 13:03.121
Well a head exploding
is a head exploding,

13:03.170 --> 13:05.331
even from a thousand feet.

13:05.390 --> 13:07.824
Gene.

13:07.870 --> 13:12.216
Doctor Patel, how does
a man of your,

13:12.260 --> 13:14.785
background come to be
a doctor in Canada?

13:14.830 --> 13:16.616
I grew up in Bombay.

13:16.660 --> 13:19.481
With the carnage in England,
we came here to train.

13:19.530 --> 13:21.839
How come you're not
fighting in the war?

13:21.880 --> 13:26.010
You've got working
arms and legs.

13:26.060 --> 13:27.664
[Air Raid Siren]

13:27.710 --> 13:29.268
Oh dear.

13:29.330 --> 13:30.718
I know what that is.

13:30.760 --> 13:31.840
Another blackout drill?

13:31.890 --> 13:33.539
It would have to be tonight.

13:33.590 --> 13:37.458
The escaped Nazis must have
made it to the city.

13:37.510 --> 13:38.454
Bob- Get the blinds.

14:05.270 --> 14:07.352
As long as the
blackout continues,
[Radio]

14:07.410 --> 14:10.186
ensure your blackout
blinds rema_in drawn.
[Radio]

14:10.240 --> 14:15.621
No lights in the street,
means no targets for
potential attack. [Radio]

14:15.680 --> 14:17.807
She said she was
bringing a "friend."

14:17.850 --> 14:19.636
She never used
the word "date."

14:19.680 --> 14:22.899
Well he's a doctor. Who cares
what God he prays to?

14:22.940 --> 14:24.635
What God does he pray to?

14:27.080 --> 14:30.902
The blackout's are in case
the Jerries are flagging
for a bomb attack.

14:30.950 --> 14:33.555
Well how did the devils
get this far?

14:33.610 --> 14:35.908
Probably jumped a freight,
industrious bastards.

14:35.960 --> 14:38.918
They're saying they found
a couple of prison uniforms

14:38.960 --> 14:40.393
in barn outside of Markham.

14:40.440 --> 14:42.522
A fiendish exploit,
I tell you.

14:42.570 --> 14:44.128
Must'_ve_stolen some
CIVIlian rags.

14:44.180 --> 14:45.966
So they're hiding
in plain sight.

14:46.010 --> 14:47.739
How? They don't
speak English.

14:47.790 --> 14:50.702
We had German prisoners
during the Great War,
spoke some.

14:50.750 --> 14:53.924
You were there, Gene. Do
Germans speak English?

14:53.980 --> 14:56.016
Gene?

14:56.060 --> 14:58.016
Mr. Aikins asked
you a question.

14:58.070 --> 15:01.233
I've never met one.

15:01.290 --> 15:04.020
I treated wounded
prisoners-of-war a few
months back,

15:04.070 --> 15:05.719
they had a command of English.

15:05.770 --> 15:08.637
Ned volunteers his medical
skills to the war effort

15:08.690 --> 15:09.896
whenever he can.

15:09.950 --> 15:12.077
Tell them about the U-Boat
captain you treated,

15:12.120 --> 15:13.906
the one taken in the Atlantic.

15:13.950 --> 15:17.681
This man was the one that gave
the orders that sunk ten
allied vessels.

15:17.740 --> 15:19.776
But Ned treated him
all the same.

15:19.830 --> 15:21.127
Helping them is an
act of mercy...

15:21.180 --> 15:23.262
That's the difference
between you and I, Doc.

15:23.310 --> 15:25.471
You save the Krauts.

15:25.530 --> 15:27.259
I shoot 'em.

15:27.310 --> 15:30.222
Laughing.

15:32.010 --> 15:33.796
Sorry.

15:33.840 --> 15:36.058
Seemed funny for some reason.

15:36.100 --> 15:38.842
Gene, I want you to apologize
to Dr. Patel.

15:38.890 --> 15:40.619
Oh, I took no offense.

15:40.670 --> 15:42.934
Doctors swear an oath
to treat all wounded,

15:42.980 --> 15:44.151
regardless of politics.

15:44.200 --> 15:46.282
And I'm the one fighting
for your freedom

15:46.330 --> 15:49.117
to practice that oath.

15:49.160 --> 15:50.980
Well who's up for
another drink?

15:51.030 --> 15:52.076
Count me in.

15:52.120 --> 15:53.291
Let's just eat already.

15:53.340 --> 15:55.808
We're waiting for the
rest of the party.

15:55.860 --> 15:57.816
This is the party.

15:57.860 --> 16:01.125
Driving's nixed in a blackout
and streetcars are down.

16:01.170 --> 16:04.560
Bob, why don't you and
Sheila take a quick look
outside for the others?

16:04.610 --> 16:05.656
I'll do it.

16:05.700 --> 16:08.089
Gene, our guests are
here to see you.

16:08.140 --> 16:10.529
So are the ones stumbling
around in the dark.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.299
Plus there's Nazis
on the prowl.

16:12.360 --> 16:15.136
At least out there
I can be of use.

16:15.190 --> 16:17.055
I say let the soldier
do his duty.

16:17.100 --> 16:22.754
If he comes up dry?
We eat.

17:00.540 --> 17:02.667
Rehearsal's cancelled.

17:02.710 --> 17:06.100
Hard to compete with
the air-raid sirens.

17:06.150 --> 17:09.233
Why do you want me to join
your choir, Leon?

17:09.280 --> 17:11.748
Because you're a
damn good mezzo.

17:11.810 --> 17:14.768
The last couple months?
You missed a lot.

17:14.810 --> 17:16.539
Missed less than you think.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.158
Something hurt you.

17:18.210 --> 17:20.633
I'm not asking for details,

17:20.690 --> 17:24.899
just offering you a place
to set your heart right.

17:24.950 --> 17:27.214
I can't sing anymore.

17:27.260 --> 17:29.820
My father, he wrung
it out of me.

17:29.870 --> 17:31.690
If I couldn't sing?

17:31.740 --> 17:35.176
I wouldn't know how to
find comfort in this world.

17:35.220 --> 17:38.656
I need something stronger than
singing to comfort me now.

17:38.700 --> 17:41.134
You're not going to
find it in a bottle.

17:41.190 --> 17:45.354
I'm flirting with another
solution later tonight.

17:45.410 --> 17:49.107
Thanks anyway, Leon.

17:49.150 --> 17:51.789
Thanks for everything.

17:51.850 --> 17:54.410
Careful you don't hurt
yourself, Churchmouse.

17:54.460 --> 17:57.099
Take care of yourself.

18:03.640 --> 18:05.858
At this rate we'll
be here all night.

18:05.910 --> 18:08.128
Vera? This is how we do things.

18:08.170 --> 18:12.254
It's one hell of
a cock-up.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.996
I mean... one heck
of a muddle.

18:15.050 --> 18:17.689
Looks like a cock-up to me.

18:17.740 --> 18:20.561
What improvements
do you propose?

18:20.620 --> 18:25.262
Well? At the factory,
we work assembly lines.

18:25.320 --> 18:28.619
Which here would mean we'd
pile each item in a row.

18:28.670 --> 18:31.537
Each gal works a station,
pass to the next...

18:31.580 --> 18:33.536
we'd cut through this
mess like butter.

18:33.590 --> 18:35.717
That seems rather
regimented.

18:35.760 --> 18:37.148
But highly efficient.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.758
Exactly!

18:38.810 --> 18:40.232
What's your name?

18:40.290 --> 18:41.370
Vera Burr.

18:41.420 --> 18:42.933
Go on then, Miss Burr.

18:42.990 --> 18:46.153
Show us how _the
gun-girls do it.

18:46.210 --> 18:47.461
Okay.

18:47.510 --> 18:51.162
First we need to put all
these tables in a row.

18:51.210 --> 18:54.168
You take knives, you
work postcards,

18:54.220 --> 18:56.996
you do diaries, you
throw in combs,

18:57.040 --> 18:58.564
you man the shaving kits,

18:58.610 --> 19:00.305
you take the pencils,

19:00.350 --> 19:03.820
and I'll handle the housewives.

19:03.880 --> 19:05.780
What about me?

19:05.840 --> 19:09.139
You get to pack the finished
ditty-bags into boxes,

19:09.190 --> 19:11.317
like we crate up
the 25-pounders.

19:11.360 --> 19:14.181
Oh I think I'll do
better with pencils.

19:14.240 --> 19:17.971
You take the helm.

19:23.680 --> 19:26.240
I can barely see my hand.

19:26.290 --> 19:29.077
Mrs. Groot never went
in for proper drapes.

19:29.120 --> 19:34.251
Unless you want the
blackout warden on our
back, this is our night.

19:36.300 --> 19:40.168
[Knocks on table.]

19:40.220 --> 19:41.039
[Another knock]

19:41.090 --> 19:43.524
I heard you the first time.

19:43.570 --> 19:45.913
[More knocking]

19:45.960 --> 19:47.439
There's someone at the door.

19:47.490 --> 19:49.560
Someone trying to
break down the door.

19:49.620 --> 19:53.181
Bed check! Everybody up!
Lets go!

19:53.230 --> 19:54.185
How did you get in?

19:54.230 --> 19:55.401
Fast-talking and
quick thinking.

19:55.450 --> 19:58.055
Come on ladies! The
party's taking off!

19:58.100 --> 19:59.237
This is outrageous.

19:59.280 --> 20:01.328
Look Gunner Boy,
you can't be here.

20:01.370 --> 20:03.543
That's where you're wrong.
I was invited.

20:03.590 --> 20:06.024
Invited? Who's brainchild
was that?

20:06.070 --> 20:07.412
Mine.

20:07.460 --> 20:09.246
There she is.

20:09.290 --> 20:11.110
Your directions were
spot-on kiddo,

20:11.160 --> 20:13.242
but your recon on
the party was not.

20:13.290 --> 20:15.554
Look, buddy. This
isn't a party.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.989
It is now.

20:18.040 --> 20:21.339
See I was just on duty
at the old-folks home.

20:21.390 --> 20:24.473
It is time to let loose.

20:24.520 --> 20:29.298
We may gotta be dark, but
we don't gotta be quiet!

20:29.350 --> 20:39.407
[Radio]

20:39.450 --> 20:49.360
[Radio]

20:53.460 --> 20:54.336
Ya!!!

20:58.340 --> 20:59.591
I couldn't find him.

20:59.640 --> 21:01.722
Oh, I hope nothing's
happened to Gene.

21:01.780 --> 21:03.031
I can take another look.

21:03.080 --> 21:04.479
Oh, would you?

21:04.520 --> 21:06.602
There's no point in Ned
roaming around in the dark.

21:06.650 --> 21:09.039
What if he's in danger?
What if he needs help?

21:09.090 --> 21:10.955
What if you serve
the roast?

21:11.000 --> 21:12.137
Not without Gene.

21:12.180 --> 21:13.431
This good stuff sure
evaporates quick.

21:13.480 --> 21:16.836
Has anybody seen
the whiskey.

21:16.880 --> 21:18.040
My brother took it.

21:18.100 --> 21:19.317
No!

21:19.360 --> 21:21.749
Mom, you know he did.

21:21.800 --> 21:23.756
Oh no.

21:23.800 --> 21:27.622
We've have tea and sherry.

21:27.670 --> 21:29.934
I'll have some of
the tea on offer.

21:29.980 --> 21:33.108
I think I've got
a bottle of rye upstairs.

21:55.790 --> 21:57.826
An impressive scheme.

21:57.880 --> 22:01.520
I can tell you're no stranger
to overcoming adversity.

22:01.580 --> 22:04.925
Got my scalp hooked in the bomb
track on the stencil line.

22:04.970 --> 22:06.619
Vera !

22:06.670 --> 22:07.625
Sorry.

22:07.670 --> 22:12.710
Don't be. It's a
badge of honour.

22:12.760 --> 22:14.808
You know Veronica Lake's
new up-do?

22:14.850 --> 22:17.410
I wrote _an article _how
she's wearing her hair back,

22:17.460 --> 22:18.677
it's safer for the floor-gals.

22:18.720 --> 22:20.449
From someone who knows.

22:20.510 --> 22:22.853
We'll be publishing it next
employee newsletter...

22:22.900 --> 22:23.810
which I edit.

22:23.860 --> 22:25.851
No better way to
motivate a lady

22:25.900 --> 22:27.720
than to marry
glamour and safety.

22:27.780 --> 22:28.769
Well done.

22:31.520 --> 22:35.035
Oh at last! Sustenance.

22:36.610 --> 22:39.431
Are you fond of shrimp
cocktail, Miss Burr?

22:39.480 --> 22:41.038
Yes.

22:41.090 --> 22:43.524
I treat myself to them every
birthday at the Arcadian Court.

22:43.570 --> 22:46.050
The cafeteria at Simpsons?

22:46.100 --> 22:48.921
What's your Christmas dinner
a hamburger at Fran's?

22:48.970 --> 22:50.358
[Laughing]

22:50.410 --> 22:51.365
Miss Demers...

22:55.060 --> 22:59.542
Things look like they're
well in hand.

22:59.590 --> 23:01.376
I have other plans.

23:01.420 --> 23:04.548
Nice to meet you all.

23:07.380 --> 23:12.943
Any shoulder to the wheel is one
deserving respect, Miss Demers.

23:27.050 --> 23:30.520
I wouldn't have imagined
those two together.

23:30.580 --> 23:33.538
You and me both.

23:33.580 --> 23:36.799
She doesn't seem
like herself.

23:36.850 --> 23:38.363
What have you all
got to eat?

23:38.410 --> 23:40.230
You've already
emptied the ice-box.

23:40.280 --> 23:41.929
Well? I skipped dinner.

23:41.980 --> 23:45.541
You're welcome to go
home and eat your own
food anytime you like.

23:45.590 --> 23:47.979
Boy, that's some kind of
hospitality, thank you.

23:48.030 --> 23:51.420
I'm hungry too. Aren't there
pickles in the cellar?

23:51.470 --> 23:56.203
Pickles! Now we're
cooking with gas.

23:56.260 --> 23:57.511
Hang on.

24:00.390 --> 24:05.521
The scuttlebut_t is that
you can Sing.

24:05.570 --> 24:06.821
Sit down.

24:06.880 --> 24:10.520
Do you know "Won't You
Come See Me Sometime"

24:10.570 --> 24:11.787
Everybody knows that one.

24:11.840 --> 24:13.831
Good, because I only
know two songs

24:13.880 --> 24:16.485
and the other one isn't
fit for mixed company.

24:21.630 --> 24:25.805
Won't you come
see me sometime

24:25.850 --> 24:29.763
Comes on let_ me fix
you a drink

24:29.810 --> 24:33.814
Whoa. Rusty pipes, huh?

24:33.860 --> 24:35.680
Here we'll take
it down a key.

24:35.730 --> 24:39.598
Ready?

24:39.650 --> 24:43.165
Won't you come
see me sometime

24:43.220 --> 24:47.736
Come on let_me fix
you a drink

24:47.790 --> 24:49.394
Don't be so shy

24:49.440 --> 24:52.000
I'm getting over a cold...

24:52.050 --> 24:56.316
Something about you
just tickles me pink

24:56.360 --> 25:00.535
You're a little too tall
but I don't mind

25:00.580 --> 25:04.368
Won't you come
see me sometime

25:04.410 --> 25:08.972
Don't run away from me
don't cloud up the rain on me

25:09.020 --> 25:12.581
Don't give me that
big old frown

25:12.640 --> 25:16.758
Come on hold me tight
it's such a lonely night

25:21.380 --> 25:25.476
Quit before I change
my mind

25:25.520 --> 25:27.909
Won't you come
see me sometime

25:29.650 --> 25:32.471
Won't you come
see me sometime

25:56.850 --> 25:58.021
Help!

26:01.950 --> 26:05.989
[Speaking German]

26:06.040 --> 26:08.816
Noise from the
party upstairs.

26:18.530 --> 26:20.919
Help!

26:20.970 --> 26:22.392
Somebody help me!

26:25.970 --> 26:29.189
The barbed wire from the
camp. It tore me.
[Broken English]

26:29.230 --> 26:31.278
You move and I
finish the job.

26:31.320 --> 26:33.629
[Speaking German]

26:33.670 --> 26:38.107
Murder you?
Who would?

26:38.160 --> 26:38.637
German?

26:38.680 --> 26:40.193
No!

26:40.250 --> 26:40.807
[Speaking German]

26:40.860 --> 26:42.327
No English!

26:42.380 --> 26:44.154
I'm Canadian.

26:47.690 --> 26:48.987
[Speaking German]

26:49.040 --> 26:52.646
What the hell are you
talking about? Now sit down.

26:52.690 --> 26:55.511
That song?

26:55.570 --> 26:58.733
Das Madchen unter
der Laterne?

26:58.790 --> 27:00.655
You remind me of Lili.

27:00.700 --> 27:03.396
Nice try. I said sit down.

27:03.440 --> 27:06.227
I don't want to harm. Only my
freedom. [Broken English]

27:06.270 --> 27:07.658
Well that's not gonna happen.

27:07.710 --> 27:10.929
I'm going to call someone
to take you back to camp.

27:10.970 --> 27:13.438
They don't want to capture me.
[Broken English]

27:13.500 --> 27:15.536
Only to kill me now.
[Broken English]

27:15.590 --> 27:18.229
My wound it healing;
only now.

27:18.280 --> 27:24.981
You broke into my cellar.

27:25.030 --> 27:26.930
Please they won't treat me.

27:26.990 --> 27:31.984
They let me die.
Please, Lili. Have mercy.

27:53.360 --> 27:55.442
Sorry to leave,
but duty calls.

27:55.490 --> 27:58.755
We should at least give Ned
a take away package of food.

27:58.800 --> 28:01.451
I promised Gene he
could carve the roast.

28:01.500 --> 28:03.491
Sheila will bring
leftovers tomorrow.

28:03.550 --> 28:04.972
Thank you,

28:05.030 --> 28:06.975
but please don't worry about
the roast. I don't eat beef.

28:07.030 --> 28:08.543
We'll meet tomorrow
for coffee?

28:08.590 --> 28:09.727
Cream and two sugars.

28:09.770 --> 28:12.375
I'll have yours waiting
when you come in.

28:12.420 --> 28:13.466
Thank you, good-night.

28:27.180 --> 28:32.834
Hey Sheila, Ned's quite
a catch, eh. Nice.

28:32.880 --> 28:34.484
Okay, sounds like...

28:34.530 --> 28:35.929
wheelbarrow?

28:35.970 --> 28:40.794
Don't worry ladies like them,
it's just their way.

28:40.840 --> 28:44.059
I thought we were all pulling
together to win a war.

28:44.110 --> 28:47.932
We are, for them it's a
chance to sip sherry.

28:47.980 --> 28:50.414
The ditty bags are
just an excuse.

28:50.460 --> 28:52.371
Mine sure came in handy.

28:52.420 --> 28:55.412
First time I saw the Luftwaffe
light up the London night

28:55.470 --> 28:57.813
with these giant flares floating
down on parachutes.

28:57.860 --> 29:02.513
Would be a thing of beauty if
they weren't turning the city
into a giant target.

29:02.560 --> 29:06.030
I used a jack knife from my
ditty bag to carve out shrapnel

29:06.090 --> 29:08.388
from the leg of a
man in my unit.

29:08.440 --> 29:11.876
So on behalf of the men who'll
be getting those bags?

29:11.920 --> 29:14.616
Thanks for saving our legs.

29:14.660 --> 29:19.745
'Course, I got my share of
revenge on the Jerries.

29:19.800 --> 29:21.791
Where have you been?

29:21.840 --> 29:23.967
My turn to go for a walk.

29:24.020 --> 29:26.102
I took down over the Channel.

29:26.150 --> 29:29.017
The bastard's face when he
realized he was going west.

29:29.070 --> 29:31.971
Nothing beats watching
the enemy's face

29:32.030 --> 29:34.806
as the life drains out of him.

29:34.860 --> 29:37.021
Nothing.

29:40.640 --> 29:42.289
Hey.

29:42.340 --> 29:44.865
Not allowed to be on the
phone during a blackout.

29:44.910 --> 29:46.559
Unless it's an emergency.

29:46.610 --> 29:47.508
Who you calling?

29:47.560 --> 29:48.959
None of your business.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.865
Where are my pickles?

29:50.910 --> 29:51.513
Pickles?

29:51.570 --> 29:53.174
Oh I get it.

29:53.220 --> 29:55.529
You're afraid of the dark.

29:55.570 --> 29:57.128
Don't worry, I'll be
your go-fer.

29:57.180 --> 29:58.875
No you won't.
Just stay here.

29:58.920 --> 30:01.832
_It's no trouble. I've been
in worse spots than your
root cellar.

30:01.880 --> 30:03.529
I'll get the bloody pickles.

30:03.580 --> 30:07.402
Sure thing, doll.
It's your house.

30:13.200 --> 30:15.839
What are you doing?
That is not your job.

30:15.900 --> 30:17.413
It's like the siege of
Stalingrad here...

30:17.460 --> 30:18.893
This is not your party!

30:18.940 --> 30:20.760
Of course it's not.
It never IS.

30:20.810 --> 30:22.459
For God's sake,
act your age.

30:22.510 --> 30:24.762
Do you care that you humiliated
me in front of Ned?!

30:24.820 --> 30:26.811
Why should I care
what he thinks?

30:26.860 --> 30:30.341
Because I like him! Of
course, you're too busy
showing off Gene to notice.

30:30.390 --> 30:32.290
How could you bring that
man into my house?

30:32.350 --> 30:33.510
Knowing what he
knows about me?

30:33.570 --> 30:35.515
What does he know?
That you lost a baby?

30:35.570 --> 30:37.265
After tonight, seeing
you act like tonight,

30:37.310 --> 30:40.086
he probably thinks that
was for the best...

30:40.140 --> 30:43.177
Gene's made a fool out of you.

30:43.230 --> 30:47.189
And you're the only
one who can't see it.

30:49.580 --> 30:51.229
Dinner!

30:59.640 --> 31:01.983
I'm not gonna let
you die in here.

31:02.030 --> 31:04.669
I'll stop the bleeding,
so you stand a chance.

31:04.730 --> 31:08.245
Then you're back
to that camp.

31:08.300 --> 31:11.645
All I gotta do is scream, and
there's a guest upstairs,

31:11.690 --> 31:18.380
only too happy to
kill you dead.

31:18.440 --> 31:20.522
You know things.

31:20.570 --> 31:22.652
I grew up on a farm,

31:22.700 --> 31:24.656
brothers hacking off this,
cutting open that.

31:24.700 --> 31:26.748
No doctor for miles.

31:26.790 --> 31:29.611
Tommy caught a wound like
this on a hay rake.

31:29.670 --> 31:32.480
Thomas.

31:32.540 --> 31:35.441
Is a strong German name.

31:35.500 --> 31:40.540
Named after an uncle
from Aberdeen.

31:40.590 --> 31:44.026
You hide who you are, Lili.

31:44.070 --> 31:45.674
I can see why.

31:45.720 --> 31:47.676
They will make
you the enemy.

31:55.170 --> 31:58.606
Help!!! Somebody!

32:02.220 --> 32:04.780
Somebody! Help!

32:08.790 --> 32:12.612
I do what I must,
to be free.

32:12.660 --> 32:17.962
You were right. We are the same.
[In German]

32:18.020 --> 32:21.274
We are the_ same.
[In English]

32:41.740 --> 32:46.302
Where is your family from?
[In German]

32:46.350 --> 32:50.218
Near Stuttgart.
[In German]

32:54.100 --> 32:59.140
Oma came over in 1905,
[In English]

32:59.190 --> 33:01.317
helped break the plains.
[In English]

33:01.370 --> 33:03.270
Many Germans build this country.
[In English]

33:03.320 --> 33:07.199
And had to bury their roots
during the Great War.

33:07.240 --> 33:09.458
To avoid the camps.

33:09.500 --> 33:13.721
The camps, or the angry mobs
trying to attack them,

33:13.770 --> 33:16.330
destory their property.

33:16.380 --> 33:19.679
Even after the war,
my family

33:19.730 --> 33:21.209
they were still afraid.

33:21.260 --> 33:28.257
But some of these roots,
you dig them up.

33:28.310 --> 33:31.302
Oma spoke the language
at home.

33:31.350 --> 33:32.954
I listened.

33:33.010 --> 33:37.094
Before she died, I made her
teach me her onion cake recipe.

33:37.140 --> 33:42.009
You know, you would be
a queen in Stuttgart.

33:42.060 --> 33:44.403
You wouldn't have to
hide who you are.

33:44.450 --> 33:46.793
Ya.

33:46.850 --> 33:49.364
But here
they'd lock me up.

33:49.410 --> 33:53.801
Treat me no different
than they treat you.

33:58.510 --> 34:02.298
Hey.
So awww...

34:02.340 --> 34:05.389
Your friends they were telling
me about your fianc,

34:05.430 --> 34:08.388
sowing his wild
oats in London.

34:08.430 --> 34:12.252
I'm not discussing
James with you.

34:12.310 --> 34:14.392
Then let me do
the talking then.

34:14.440 --> 34:17.136
He's a rich kid,
born into command.

34:17.180 --> 34:21.219
Didn't have to earn it the
hard way, the real way.

34:21.270 --> 34:23.830
Go ahead, tell me I'm wrong.

34:23.880 --> 34:26.531
But you, working the plant?

34:26.580 --> 34:28.628
You're playing some
funny game.

34:28.670 --> 34:31.184
These other girls,
they need the money.

34:31.240 --> 34:33.458
But what do you need?

34:33.500 --> 34:36.287
To make time with
things that go "boom"?

34:41.900 --> 34:44.118
Beans.

34:44.160 --> 34:45.855
That's were I
recongize you from.

34:45.900 --> 34:48.778
Your face is on
cans of beans.

34:50.650 --> 34:54.950
My father likes
flaunting my war-work.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.252
Yeah, and how does
that sit with you?

34:57.310 --> 34:59.699
What do you think?

34:59.740 --> 35:03.483
Do you believe what
you're selling?

35:03.530 --> 35:06.613
I don't even know
what I'm selling.

35:06.660 --> 35:09.925
That makes two of us.

35:12.370 --> 35:16.409
[Air Raid Siren]

35:16.460 --> 35:19.418
All clear.

35:19.460 --> 35:20.415
That's Wailing Willy.

35:20.460 --> 35:21.677
I'll say.

35:31.390 --> 35:34.553
Must mean they found
the prisoners.

35:34.610 --> 35:37.295
At least enough they're not
worried about a bomb-plot.

35:37.350 --> 35:40.217
I'm so sorry about
everything.

35:40.260 --> 35:43.172
Sorry, schmorry.
The blackout's over.

35:43.220 --> 35:45.393
We survived!

35:48.450 --> 35:50.668
It's been a night.

35:54.450 --> 35:58.329
That's okay, come on Minnie,
here you go.

35:58.370 --> 36:00.326
Let's get you to bed.

36:04.460 --> 36:09.727
Lorna, Bob? Thanks for
a lovely evening.

36:09.770 --> 36:11.283
Let's go dear.

36:13.170 --> 36:13.943
That's it.

36:17.430 --> 36:26.429
Laughing.

36:30.530 --> 36:35.354
It's the all clear.

36:35.410 --> 36:38.220
You didn't turn me in,

36:38.280 --> 36:41.454
because you can't.

36:41.500 --> 36:42.842
Because we're the same.

36:48.290 --> 36:50.895
Look just leave.

36:50.940 --> 36:54.330
I won't yell. I promise.

36:54.380 --> 36:58.942
I told you there is a guy
upstairs who will kill you.

36:58.990 --> 37:01.777
I've been hiding
Germans my whole life.

37:01.820 --> 37:03.378
Tonight's no different.

37:06.440 --> 37:07.600
Go!

37:12.490 --> 37:17.052
I was so happy when he came
home in one piece,

37:17.100 --> 37:21.753
I let myself believe the
war made him into a man.

37:21.800 --> 37:27.363
He's as selfish and as
stubborn as he was when
he was a little boy.

37:27.410 --> 37:30.197
I loved that little
boy so much.

37:32.770 --> 37:35.591
But he's always done
what he wanted,

37:35.640 --> 37:37.073
when he wanted.

37:37.120 --> 37:39.156
And I've let him.

37:39.210 --> 37:42.111
We let him.

37:42.170 --> 37:45.207
Everything's gone so wrong.

37:47.910 --> 37:51.380
I used to think I
was a good mother.

37:51.440 --> 37:52.862
You are.

37:54.530 --> 37:55.747
You are.

37:55.790 --> 38:01.228
No one can predict what
war will do to a man.

38:13.420 --> 38:15.229
Nothing happened.

38:15.290 --> 38:18.248
_ Thanks to the air raid
Siren ruming your moment.

38:18.290 --> 38:20.372
I've been fighting
Gene off all night...

38:20.420 --> 38:23.901
Poor Gladys, endlessly
fighting off men.

38:27.130 --> 38:28.779
It's time.

38:32.130 --> 38:34.473
Am I right to
trust you, Lili?

38:35.180 --> 38:37.000
Ya.

38:37.050 --> 38:40.838
And why do you think
I should do that?

38:42.840 --> 38:44.740
Something happened to
you, Kate,

38:44.800 --> 38:49.316
and it sure as sugar has nothing
to do with Eugene Corbett.

38:49.370 --> 38:52.919
You're not yourself anymore.

38:52.980 --> 38:53.969
My father...

38:54.020 --> 38:56.807
Has gone.

38:56.850 --> 38:59.102
So what are you afraid of?

39:01.680 --> 39:03.591
Everything.

39:04.510 --> 39:05.329
Here.

39:14.130 --> 39:18.169
He's getting away!
Help! Help!

39:18.220 --> 39:19.209
Betty?

39:19.260 --> 39:21.876
Here's in the baclqard!

39:21.920 --> 39:23.353
What is it?

39:23.400 --> 39:24.173
Who is he?

39:24.230 --> 39:25.709
The prisoner of war.

39:25.750 --> 39:28.139
You're one of the
damn escaped Nazis!

39:28.190 --> 39:30.317
I am a prisoner under
the Geneva...

39:31.190 --> 39:33.317
Stop! You're killing him!

39:35.280 --> 39:37.145
Stop it!

39:41.420 --> 39:43.320
Someone call the police.

39:51.210 --> 39:54.862
Ladies, say hello to Fritz.

40:01.390 --> 40:03.608
You're wrong.

40:03.660 --> 40:06.390
I'm not like you.

40:06.440 --> 40:09.227
None of us can hide forever.
[In German]

40:09.270 --> 40:11.659
Speak for yourself.

40:17.320 --> 40:19.311
Betty, what happened?

40:24.160 --> 40:26.196
I didn't get pickles.

40:43.310 --> 40:47.269
A Nazi in our home,
I can't fathom it.

40:47.310 --> 40:51.701
He might have killed you.

40:51.750 --> 40:53.479
He said something to you.

40:55.450 --> 41:01.446
He told me none of
us can hide forever.

41:01.500 --> 41:04.401
We do what we have to,

41:04.460 --> 41:05.802
to survive.

41:07.500 --> 41:11.504
But when we're finally safe?

41:11.550 --> 41:16.328
It's okay to stop fighting.

41:30.180 --> 41:32.876
Your mother does
not deserve this.

41:35.490 --> 41:38.835
You are going to make
it up to her...

41:48.500 --> 41:51.025
Here's some supper
from last night.

41:52.680 --> 41:55.410
Come; it's been a
busy night.

41:58.510 --> 42:00.819
Good morning Karl,
how are you?

42:18.440 --> 42:21.568
Mrs. Beaverton...?

42:37.550 --> 42:40.508
You're in the paper Gene.

42:40.550 --> 42:42.859
You really should read this.
