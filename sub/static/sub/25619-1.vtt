00:18.119 --> 00:20.821
- When I couldn't find Karla I

00:20.821 --> 00:24.325
knew immediately that
something bad happened to her.

00:24.325 --> 00:25.559
And I'm scared.

00:28.562 --> 00:32.232
As more scared as I've
ever been in my life.

00:34.302 --> 00:36.637
It reminded me of
like when you're a kid

00:36.637 --> 00:38.406
and you do something wrong,

00:38.406 --> 00:40.741
that feeling that you get
in the pit of your stomach.

00:40.741 --> 00:42.009
'Cause you know it was
just a matter of time

00:42.009 --> 00:45.045
before someone found
out what you did.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.547
That's how I felt.

00:57.391 --> 00:59.560
Because I knew right away.

01:00.528 --> 01:03.597
No one's ever gonna believe me.

01:06.434 --> 01:08.102
- It has
been nearly three days

01:08.102 --> 01:10.204
since 28 year old Karla Marks

01:10.204 --> 01:12.773
was first reported
missing by her husband.

01:12.773 --> 01:15.476
And authorities are still
searching for any clues

01:15.476 --> 01:17.745
as to the woman's whereabouts.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.980
Police are still
questioning the husband,

01:19.980 --> 01:21.882
but as of now there is no word

01:21.882 --> 01:26.086
as to whether or not they
believe foul play was a factor.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.389
Police and search
parties continue to comb

01:28.389 --> 01:31.592
the nearby area, including
the surrounding woods

01:31.592 --> 01:34.562
for any sign of Marks but so far

01:34.562 --> 01:38.232
little is known of her
possible whereabouts.

02:05.759 --> 02:08.961
- I arrived at the scene
at approximately 6:20 a.m..

02:08.961 --> 02:10.398
The first thing I
noticed when I arrived

02:10.398 --> 02:12.466
is that Mr. Marks did
seem to be genuinely

02:12.466 --> 02:14.702
concerned for the
safety of his wife.

02:14.702 --> 02:16.837
He was adamant that
something had happened to her

02:16.837 --> 02:19.940
though he never specified
what he thought that was.

02:19.940 --> 02:23.811
He just kept making
statements such as,

02:23.811 --> 02:25.346
"No one's gonna believe me

02:25.346 --> 02:27.981
"and everyone's gonna
think I'm making this up."

02:27.981 --> 02:29.417
Things like that.

02:29.417 --> 02:32.586
Which seemed a little
odd at the time.

02:34.188 --> 02:37.491
- I had no idea if the police
were gonna believe me or not.

02:37.491 --> 02:40.394
I mean hell, I didn't
even know what I believed.

02:40.394 --> 02:42.830
I just knew that Karla was gone

02:42.830 --> 02:44.298
and I was positive
that it had something

02:44.298 --> 02:46.234
to do with that place.

02:46.234 --> 02:48.469
- Mr. Marks claimed
he left the building

02:48.469 --> 02:49.937
to go out to the car

02:49.937 --> 02:52.406
and when he returned
she was gone.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.975
He then spent the next
few hours looking for her

02:54.975 --> 02:58.011
before becoming concerned
enough to contact the police.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.848
I did the think the whole
thing was a bit suspicious,

03:00.848 --> 03:02.850
but there were
several explanations

03:02.850 --> 03:04.218
that had to be considered before

03:04.218 --> 03:06.254
pointing any fingers at him.

03:06.254 --> 03:08.589
- How do you convince
someone, especially the police

03:08.589 --> 03:12.760
that you think your wife is a
victim of a paranormal event?

03:14.262 --> 03:17.698
It almost sounds crazy coming
out of my mouth right now.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.234
- I did a search
of the property,

03:20.234 --> 03:23.337
there didn't seem to be
any signs of a struggle

03:23.337 --> 03:25.773
or anything indicating that
a crime had taken place.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.875
And at that point, the
sun was just about up

03:27.875 --> 03:29.277
and I was unsure
of how to proceed

03:29.277 --> 03:30.878
so I called for backup.

03:30.878 --> 03:34.648
And I'll be honest, from
everything I saw at the scene,

03:34.648 --> 03:38.218
it did appear that
Karla had just vanished.

03:55.369 --> 03:58.138
- I remember lying in
bed when the phone rang.

03:58.138 --> 04:01.442
It was about 7 o'clock
in the morning.

04:01.442 --> 04:03.110
I remember thinking
it was strange that

04:03.110 --> 04:07.080
the phone was ringing
so early in the morning.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.882
I thought it must be
some kind of mistake,

04:08.882 --> 04:11.218
a wrong number perhaps.

04:11.218 --> 04:12.453
Nancy offered to get it

04:12.453 --> 04:14.187
and I was already pretty much up

04:14.187 --> 04:15.923
so I answered it myself.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.492
- I remembered John
answering the phone

04:18.492 --> 04:22.062
and I knew immediately
before he even said a word

04:22.062 --> 04:24.498
that something was wrong.

04:24.498 --> 04:26.233
Some might call it a
mother's intuition,

04:26.233 --> 04:28.836
but I knew right
away that something

04:28.836 --> 04:30.338
had happened to Karla.

04:30.338 --> 04:32.072
- I still thought it
might be a wrong number

04:32.072 --> 04:34.342
til the voice at the
other end said my name

04:34.342 --> 04:37.511
and I knew right
away it was Bryan.

04:37.511 --> 04:40.748
He then told me that
Karla was missing.

04:40.748 --> 04:42.316
- John got off the phone

04:42.316 --> 04:45.486
and he told me that
Karla was missing.

04:46.887 --> 04:49.323
But there was a search
party out looking for her.

04:49.323 --> 04:52.059
So in that moment
I was relieved.

04:53.727 --> 04:56.630
I mean I didn't think they
weren't going to find her.

04:56.630 --> 04:57.798
- Once the police
started the search

04:57.798 --> 05:00.468
they kept me away from the area.

05:00.468 --> 05:03.837
I wanted to help out but
they wouldn't let me.

05:03.837 --> 05:06.340
They just kept interviewing me

05:06.340 --> 05:08.308
and asking me questions.

05:08.308 --> 05:12.045
Same questions over
and over again.

05:12.045 --> 05:14.181
That's when I knew
they didn't believe me.

05:14.181 --> 05:16.083
- There's so much going on.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.918
Nancy and I made phone calls.

05:17.918 --> 05:20.187
We contacted the media.

05:20.187 --> 05:22.790
We helped with the search party.

05:22.790 --> 05:25.225
It was just a
frenzy of emotions.

05:25.225 --> 05:28.896
- You hear stories about
people going missing

05:28.896 --> 05:30.564
and never found but,

05:32.666 --> 05:35.335
when it's someone you know,

05:35.335 --> 05:38.338
you just automatically assume
they're going to be found.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.508
I had hope that everything

05:43.043 --> 05:45.813
would still be
alright, you know?

05:53.421 --> 05:54.254
I...

05:58.158 --> 05:59.560
I didn't realize,

06:03.531 --> 06:07.701
I didn't realize how foolish
that idea really was.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.174
- It was after they
called off the search,

06:14.174 --> 06:16.810
that the reality of
the situation just

06:16.810 --> 06:19.212
came crashing down around us.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.115
Just as quickly
as it all started

06:22.115 --> 06:25.719
it seemed like everyone
just forgot about Karla.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.455
Nancy and I were left
to deal with this

06:27.455 --> 06:30.157
all by ourselves and all
we had were questions

06:30.157 --> 06:31.425
and no answers.

06:36.196 --> 06:38.532
- Karla and Bryan
met in 2009 I think.

06:38.532 --> 06:40.968
We were just about to
graduate from college.

06:40.968 --> 06:42.670
That's actually how
her and Bryan met,

06:42.670 --> 06:45.205
at a paranormal
convention on campus.

06:45.205 --> 06:47.074
He was there with a
group of his friends.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.510
They were all part of an
amateur paranormal group.

06:49.510 --> 06:52.012
They hit it off right away
and started dating right away.

06:52.012 --> 06:54.882
And it wasn't long before Bryan
eventually proposed to her.

06:54.882 --> 06:57.818
- The supernatural that always

06:57.818 --> 06:59.753
interested both of us.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.155
And I guess you could say

07:02.155 --> 07:04.191
it's the one thing that
brought us together.

07:04.191 --> 07:07.728
- I knew Karla and Bryan
mainly on a professional level.

07:07.728 --> 07:09.296
My husband and I were
on Horror New Network,

07:09.296 --> 07:10.931
which is a horror website.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.666
Very similar to what
they do so we would

07:12.666 --> 07:14.868
see them at conventions.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.937
They were very much liked
in the horror community

07:16.937 --> 07:20.007
which why it was so shocking
when she disappeared.

07:20.007 --> 07:23.310
- Karla was in love with
Bryan from the start.

07:23.310 --> 07:25.312
You could just tell right away.

07:25.312 --> 07:30.250
And everyone in the family
really seemed to like him.

07:30.250 --> 07:33.721
The only problem
was Karla's father.

07:33.721 --> 07:37.525
He didn't seem to approve
of their lifestyle.

07:37.525 --> 07:40.828
- I knew that her father
didn't really approve of it.

07:40.828 --> 07:43.263
But I never forced
her into anything.

07:43.263 --> 07:45.098
- While most girls were
spending their money

07:45.098 --> 07:47.367
on clothes and makeup,
Karla was spending

07:47.367 --> 07:50.671
her money on EMF detectors and

07:50.671 --> 07:52.506
audio equipment.

07:52.506 --> 07:54.542
- In fact it was actually Karla

07:54.542 --> 07:56.977
who had the idea
for the website.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.980
It gave her a chance
to immerse herself in

07:59.980 --> 08:01.248
all of her passions.

08:01.248 --> 08:04.417
Writing, photography,
paranormal.

08:04.417 --> 08:06.419
It was the perfect job for her.

08:06.419 --> 08:07.988
- I didn't like all
the supernatural

08:07.988 --> 08:09.823
ghost crap they were into.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.424
I especially didn't
like them roaming around

08:11.424 --> 08:13.260
all these strange
and secluded places

08:13.260 --> 08:15.062
all by themselves.

08:15.062 --> 08:16.029
I was always afraid
something like this

08:16.029 --> 08:17.898
was gonna happen one day.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.967
- He just doesn't
believe in the paranormal

08:19.967 --> 08:23.170
and it's something he definitely
doesn't wanna talk about.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.906
- No I don't believe
in that nonsense.

08:25.906 --> 08:28.175
I think it's a bunch
of make believe.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.710
Stories people like
to tell each other

08:29.710 --> 08:32.111
in order to scare each other.

08:33.914 --> 08:35.749
And frankly, it's not Christian.

08:35.749 --> 08:38.919
The Bible doesn't
ever mention ghosts.

08:39.886 --> 08:40.721
Of course.

08:45.392 --> 08:47.527
I believe in the Holy Spirit.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.931
And angels, well,
they're not human.

08:50.931 --> 08:52.733
They're God's
messengers, his way of

08:52.733 --> 08:54.902
connecting heaven and earth.

08:54.902 --> 08:58.839
And when people die their
soul ascends into heaven.

08:58.839 --> 09:00.207
Which would mean there'd be

09:00.207 --> 09:03.176
no such thing as
ghosts would there?

09:12.820 --> 09:14.054
- We were investigating a place

09:14.054 --> 09:16.456
called the Devil's
Well in Connecticut.

09:16.456 --> 09:19.292
It's believed by some that

09:19.292 --> 09:23.831
the well is actually a
gateway or portal to hell.

09:23.831 --> 09:25.933
- Now one of our
more popular legends

09:25.933 --> 09:28.368
is about the Devil's Well.

09:28.368 --> 09:30.871
And it has sort of a dark past

09:32.039 --> 09:33.641
which is why there've
been a lot of

09:33.641 --> 09:36.143
sort of colorful stories
associated with it.

09:36.143 --> 09:38.478
- I think New
England in general,

09:38.478 --> 09:41.314
due to it's location and
the history of the area,

09:41.314 --> 09:43.817
it has quite a bit of
paranormal activity.

09:43.817 --> 09:46.053
- We encourage our
readers to write into us

09:46.053 --> 09:48.188
and suggest places
that they think

09:48.188 --> 09:49.589
that we should investigate.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.892
And one of our
readers emailed us

09:51.892 --> 09:54.995
about the Devil's Well and
it sounded interesting.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.596
So we thought we'd check it out.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.866
- I have never been
to the Devil's Well.

09:58.866 --> 10:00.634
I think it's some place
I'd like to check out.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.636
I'm a little curious
and intrigued by it.

10:02.636 --> 10:07.440
- The well just seemed
like a normal well I guess.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.176
The weirdest thing
about it was that

10:09.176 --> 10:10.844
it was in the middle
of this basement.

10:10.844 --> 10:13.280
It just didn't seem like
it belonged there you know.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.182
- No one knows who
actually built the well,

10:15.182 --> 10:17.851
but the first
recorded information

10:17.851 --> 10:20.721
about who actually
owned the property

10:20.721 --> 10:22.622
relates to a family
called Woods.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.659
In the early 1700's
they bought the place.

10:25.659 --> 10:27.961
It was a mother, a
father, and two daughters.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.997
Mary and Margaret.

10:29.997 --> 10:31.899
There was some kind
of an accident.

10:31.899 --> 10:35.803
Mary ended up dead at
the bottom of the well.

10:35.803 --> 10:37.337
Of course the
family claimed that

10:37.337 --> 10:38.872
she had just slipped
and fallen in.

10:38.872 --> 10:41.474
But what was strange is that
her sister Margaret said,

10:41.474 --> 10:43.010
no, she had not slipped,

10:43.010 --> 10:46.613
that Mary had flung
herself into the well

10:46.613 --> 10:48.148
and committed suicide.

10:48.148 --> 10:51.719
- I don't consider myself
like a religious person

10:51.719 --> 10:54.621
so I don't necessarily
believe that it leads to hell.

10:54.621 --> 10:56.623
But, one thing I can say

10:57.657 --> 11:00.027
is there definitely is a strong

11:00.027 --> 11:01.895
negative energy in that place.

11:01.895 --> 11:06.633
- Now in 1915, a man named Henry
Kidder bought the property.

11:06.633 --> 11:08.235
And he bought it
because he wanted

11:08.235 --> 11:10.670
to put up a textile
mill, which he did.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.172
And it was very successful.

11:12.172 --> 11:15.075
Lots of the local people
were employed here.

11:15.075 --> 11:18.078
But there were strange rumors
about his personal life.

11:18.078 --> 11:20.147
Especially his
fascination with the

11:20.147 --> 11:22.449
dark arts and the occult.

11:22.449 --> 11:23.917
And it didn't help
any that he built

11:23.917 --> 11:26.253
the mill right on
top of the well

11:26.253 --> 11:29.356
and he built a room
around the well.

11:29.356 --> 11:32.192
Very specifically designed.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.294
But no one knows
why he did that.

11:34.294 --> 11:36.396
Ever since then,

11:36.396 --> 11:39.499
well the well was kind
of associated with

11:39.499 --> 11:41.601
dark doings shall we say.

11:41.601 --> 11:43.236
- We got called to
that area a lot.

11:43.236 --> 11:46.639
Claims of satanists,
and devil worshipers.

11:46.639 --> 11:48.041
Of course it was the 80's,

11:48.041 --> 11:51.411
the whole satanic panic
was in full swing.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.313
- Everything was quiet
up there until the 80's

11:53.313 --> 11:56.116
when there was some
kind of an incident.

11:56.116 --> 11:59.386
- I never liked getting
called to that place.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.755
And on this particular night,

12:03.123 --> 12:05.793
it was definitely something off.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.796
- The
police were called,

12:08.796 --> 12:10.063
there was an altercation,

12:10.063 --> 12:12.800
and the police
officer was stabbed

12:12.800 --> 12:15.168
and another man was shot.

12:15.168 --> 12:19.006
- I observed a bunch of
people in hooded robes

12:20.440 --> 12:22.709
and there's this naked girl

12:24.444 --> 12:26.613
standing in front of them.

12:28.448 --> 12:32.285
And I immediately noticed
that she had blood

12:32.285 --> 12:33.720
on her.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.956
I drew my weapon, I ordered
everybody to get down

12:35.956 --> 12:39.459
and they turned around,
they looked at me.

12:40.961 --> 12:42.629
I couldn't see their faces.

12:42.629 --> 12:43.897
Either they were wearing masks

12:43.897 --> 12:46.633
or their faces were painted.

12:46.633 --> 12:49.636
But I could tell
from their demeanor

12:49.636 --> 12:51.538
they weren't scared of me.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.006
They were angry.

12:53.006 --> 12:56.944
I was interrupting
whatever they were up to.

12:56.944 --> 13:00.848
I didn't see the suspect
come up behind me,

13:00.848 --> 13:03.817
but I felt a sharp
pain in my back.

13:03.817 --> 13:07.154
I turned, I realized
I had been stabbed.

13:08.355 --> 13:12.292
So I started firing my
weapon several times.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.928
I don't know how
many people I hit

13:14.928 --> 13:18.265
but one, only one guy,
one suspect went down.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.200
Everybody else fled
and were never found.

13:20.200 --> 13:23.370
As far as what they
were doing down there,

13:23.370 --> 13:24.471
I don't know.

13:25.672 --> 13:28.508
But, it scared the
hell out of me.

13:30.343 --> 13:34.147
And not a day goes by that
I don't think about it.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.582
And I just always wonder

13:35.582 --> 13:37.350
what happened to that

13:38.651 --> 13:39.486
poor girl

13:43.456 --> 13:45.792
that I had found down there.

13:50.097 --> 13:51.698
- I've done a lot
of investigations

13:51.698 --> 13:54.367
and I've never felt that sort of

13:55.368 --> 13:56.970
energy so strongly.

14:00.240 --> 14:03.010
I hope that it's not the case,

14:03.010 --> 14:05.412
but there is part
of me that thinks

14:05.412 --> 14:09.917
it absolutely had something
to do with Karla disappearing.

14:34.942 --> 14:36.977
- See anything?

14:36.977 --> 14:38.878
- No, not yet.

14:41.581 --> 14:45.118
- This place
seems really fucking creepy.

14:45.118 --> 14:46.553
- Yeah it is.

14:46.553 --> 14:49.389
It feels like a heaviness
near, you feel that?

14:49.389 --> 14:54.061
- Yeah, probably
because the place is so old.

14:54.061 --> 14:57.064
- Or it's all the asbestos
we're breathing in.

14:57.064 --> 14:58.865
- Let's hope not.

14:58.865 --> 15:00.400
- Why didn't
we bring the masks?

15:00.400 --> 15:02.502
Did we buy some?

15:02.502 --> 15:04.671
- What
the fuck was that?

15:04.671 --> 15:05.605
Did you hear that?

15:05.605 --> 15:06.974
- Yes I heard that.

15:06.974 --> 15:08.141
- Hey, take
a picture in there.

15:08.141 --> 15:10.143
See if you see anything.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.981
- Ugh.

15:13.981 --> 15:15.748
- What?

15:15.748 --> 15:17.417
- The camera died.

15:17.417 --> 15:18.785
- Is it the battery?

15:18.785 --> 15:20.787
- Yeah, but I mean
something must've drained it

15:20.787 --> 15:22.355
'cause I charged them.

15:22.355 --> 15:23.890
- Well
just use another one.

15:23.890 --> 15:27.094
- I can't, I left the
battery packs in the car.

15:27.094 --> 15:29.963
- Oh
god, damn it Karla.

15:29.963 --> 15:30.930
Alright.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.233
- Just use yours, we'll be fine.

15:33.233 --> 15:34.667
- No, we
should get backups.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.403
Here, I'll go get it.

15:37.804 --> 15:39.672
- Are you sure?

15:39.672 --> 15:41.041
- Yes, as
long as you're okay

15:41.041 --> 15:44.044
with being down
here by yourself.

15:44.044 --> 15:45.378
- I'll be fine.

15:45.378 --> 15:48.248
Just go, just be quick okay?

15:48.248 --> 15:50.283
- Alright
here, take the camera.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.851
Keep filming.

15:51.851 --> 15:53.020
I'll be right back okay?

15:53.020 --> 15:55.422
- Okay, I'll be here.

16:00.960 --> 16:01.794
Hello?

16:05.465 --> 16:07.534
Is there anyone in there?

16:11.604 --> 16:12.939
Can you hear me?

16:15.742 --> 16:18.911
I know someone's
here, I can feel you.

16:20.980 --> 16:25.152
If you can, please give me
a sign that you're here.

16:27.720 --> 16:28.555
Hello?

16:39.066 --> 16:39.899
Hello?

17:00.653 --> 17:02.289
- It has been
nearly two weeks now

17:02.289 --> 17:05.858
since we first reported on the
disappearance of Karla Marks.

17:05.858 --> 17:09.429
Unfortunately, no sign of
Marks has been discovered

17:09.429 --> 17:12.999
and police have officially
called off their search.

17:12.999 --> 17:14.601
Resources tell us
that the police

17:14.601 --> 17:18.704
are now putting the focus
on the husband, Bryan Marks.

17:18.704 --> 17:22.142
It has been confirmed that
Marks was officially arrested

17:22.142 --> 17:26.378
earlier today in connection
with his wife's disappearance.

17:26.378 --> 17:28.147
It's unknown at the
time what evidence

17:28.147 --> 17:30.783
was discovered to
warrant the arrest,

17:30.783 --> 17:32.719
but if you'll notice behind me,

17:32.719 --> 17:35.688
police tape has been put
up around the building

17:35.688 --> 17:38.491
and they are treating the
area like a crime scene.

17:38.491 --> 17:42.162
Forensics teams have
been busy here all day.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.565
- We did everything we could
think of to find Karla.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.534
We sent out search parties.

17:47.534 --> 17:50.137
We had dogs search the
building in the nearby woods.

17:50.137 --> 17:51.938
We drained the well
and had climbers

17:51.938 --> 17:53.340
go down into it.

17:53.340 --> 17:55.542
We even searched a
nearby lake just in case,

17:55.542 --> 17:56.376
but,

17:57.710 --> 17:59.146
we found nothing.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.515
No trace of Karla.

18:02.515 --> 18:05.718
Nothing to support the theory
that she might be lost.

18:05.718 --> 18:06.953
That's when we
turned our attention

18:06.953 --> 18:09.289
to the theory of foul play.

18:09.289 --> 18:13.693
- Once I was arrested, it
was all over from there.

18:13.693 --> 18:16.163
People just assumed
that if I was arrested

18:16.163 --> 18:17.897
that I must have
had something to do

18:17.897 --> 18:20.200
with Karla's disappearance.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.569
- They had nothing
and they knew it.

18:22.569 --> 18:25.372
The town was fed up
with the unwanted press

18:25.372 --> 18:28.040
and the department was
under scrutiny at the time.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.277
Now I think the police
were hoping if an arrest

18:30.277 --> 18:33.613
was made then the media
attention would go away.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.882
And the whole town wanted
to forget the whole thing.

18:35.882 --> 18:38.518
They wanted everything
to go back to normal.

18:38.518 --> 18:41.821
So the police were under
pressure to make that happen

18:41.821 --> 18:44.157
and they arrested my client.

20:21.220 --> 20:24.223
He was exhausted and stressed.

20:24.223 --> 20:27.126
I mean he hadn't eaten
or slept for days.

20:27.126 --> 20:28.628
And he was scared.

20:30.162 --> 20:32.131
You could see it in his eyes.

20:32.131 --> 20:35.134
I think he was scared because

20:35.134 --> 20:37.504
the realization
that Karla was gone

20:37.504 --> 20:38.805
had settled in.

20:38.805 --> 20:40.106
And not only that she was gone

20:40.106 --> 20:42.642
but that he was starting to get

20:42.642 --> 20:45.177
the blame for his
wife's disappearance.

20:45.177 --> 20:46.646
- No one wanted
to believe anymore

20:46.646 --> 20:48.915
and everyone just
kept looking at me

20:48.915 --> 20:51.351
as if I was hiding something.

20:54.421 --> 20:56.356
Of course they had to
cut me loose eventually

20:56.356 --> 20:58.725
because they had nothing on me.

20:58.725 --> 21:01.728
But by then the damage was done.

21:01.728 --> 21:04.230
- It's been a while
since we've seen Bryan.

21:04.230 --> 21:07.467
After he was released he
tried to come and talk to us

21:07.467 --> 21:10.236
but, John wouldn't have it.

21:10.236 --> 21:13.806
In fact he went after
Bryan physically.

21:13.806 --> 21:17.410
We haven't seen or
heard from him since.

21:17.410 --> 21:20.513
- Do I think Bryan did
something to Karla?

21:20.513 --> 21:23.516
Honestly I have to
believe that he did.

21:23.516 --> 21:26.386
Otherwise what possible
explanation is there?

21:26.386 --> 21:27.654
People just don't
disappear without

21:27.654 --> 21:30.657
someone making them
disappear right?

21:32.158 --> 21:33.993
So if you ask me, yes.

21:35.328 --> 21:38.164
I think Bryan did
something to my daughter.

21:38.164 --> 21:41.634
- John believes that Bryan
did something the Karla.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.503
And even if he doesn't
really believe it,

21:43.503 --> 21:46.606
he won't let himself
think otherwise.

21:47.974 --> 21:50.510
Because it's too
painful any other way.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.812
I still have hope that some day

21:52.812 --> 21:54.146
my daughter will be found.

21:54.146 --> 21:57.484
But, it's that hope
that hurts the most.

21:58.885 --> 22:02.822
Keeps the whole thing
fresh in my mind every day.

22:03.956 --> 22:07.494
I just don't think John
can live like that.

22:07.494 --> 22:10.062
I think he has to
assume the worst.

22:10.062 --> 22:11.564
So he can move on.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.467
- I'd like to think
that he didn't have

22:14.467 --> 22:18.004
anything to do with
her disappearance.

22:18.004 --> 22:22.108
Of course, I mean I guess
you never really know.

22:22.108 --> 22:24.110
But I don't think
that that's the case

22:24.110 --> 22:25.612
in this situation.

22:26.713 --> 22:28.715
At least I hope not.

22:28.715 --> 22:31.684
- I mean they were planning
on having kids together.

22:31.684 --> 22:32.919
I don't think that
that's something you do

22:32.919 --> 22:36.589
when you're planning
on murdering your wife.

22:41.494 --> 22:45.197
No I just meant I don't think
he killed her or anything.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.365
But he brought her to that place

22:46.365 --> 22:49.101
so indirectly he
was responsible.

22:52.271 --> 22:54.073
- I can't say what
happened to Karla.

22:54.073 --> 22:58.244
Any theories I may have
would be mere speculation.

23:04.484 --> 23:08.655
As an attorney, I don't think
I should answer that question.

23:15.828 --> 23:17.063
- No.

23:17.063 --> 23:20.132
No, I don't believe
in the paranormal.

23:21.434 --> 23:23.402
I believe in facts and evidence.

23:23.402 --> 23:24.771
In my line of work it's always

23:24.771 --> 23:27.106
people harming other people.

23:28.407 --> 23:31.478
Not to mention, I spent
days at that location

23:31.478 --> 23:33.079
along with several
other detectives

23:33.079 --> 23:35.615
and forensic professionals.

23:35.615 --> 23:36.916
And none of them reported

23:36.916 --> 23:39.786
anything unusual
happening to them.

25:54.954 --> 25:57.590
- I'm Lucas Baker, the lead
investigator for S.I.G.N.S..

25:57.590 --> 26:00.092
Bryan contacted me because
back in our college days

26:00.092 --> 26:02.261
we actually used to do some
investigations together.

26:02.261 --> 26:03.763
So we have a bit of a history.

26:03.763 --> 26:06.565
- I contacted Lucas because
of our past history together.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.100
At this point in
time I feel like

26:08.100 --> 26:10.903
he's one of the few people
that I can actually trust.

26:10.903 --> 26:13.673
- News of his
wife's disappearance

26:13.673 --> 26:16.542
spread pretty quickly throughout
the paranormal community.

26:16.542 --> 26:18.510
So when he called
I pretty much knew

26:18.510 --> 26:20.512
exactly what he wanted.

26:20.512 --> 26:22.882
- I'm confident that
he'll put together

26:22.882 --> 26:25.484
the right team to do
this investigation.

26:25.484 --> 26:29.321
- When she disappeared,
it was fascinating to me.

26:29.321 --> 26:30.823
I mean there have been
numerous cases of people

26:30.823 --> 26:32.458
disappearing throughout history.

26:32.458 --> 26:34.360
I mean they tend to
just chalk this up

26:34.360 --> 26:36.763
to bad technology or poor
resources at the time.

26:36.763 --> 26:39.666
But today we have
resources that far

26:39.666 --> 26:41.167
surpass what we used to.

26:41.167 --> 26:44.236
So I'm actually pretty
excited to get down there

26:44.236 --> 26:47.006
and see if we can
find some answers.

26:47.006 --> 26:49.041
And possibly some
really strong evidence

26:49.041 --> 26:51.477
that we've never seen before.

26:51.477 --> 26:55.882
- I'm Kris Manners, I'm one of
the investigators for SIGNS.

26:55.882 --> 26:57.717
Yeah, I'm pretty
excited to know we're

26:57.717 --> 26:59.752
gonna be checking out the
place around the Devil's Well.

26:59.752 --> 27:02.354
There's a lot of crazy
stories about that place.

27:02.354 --> 27:04.523
Who knows what we
might find down there.

27:04.523 --> 27:05.992
- Hi, my name is Riley Harper

27:05.992 --> 27:08.661
and I've been involved with
SIGNS for about three years now.

27:08.661 --> 27:10.062
Well let me put it this way,

27:10.062 --> 27:12.264
either something supernatural
happened to that girl

27:12.264 --> 27:14.233
and the same thing could
happen to all of us

27:14.233 --> 27:16.368
or her husband did it.

27:16.368 --> 27:17.770
And now we are
voluntarily putting

27:17.770 --> 27:20.807
ourselves in an abandoned
building with him.

27:20.807 --> 27:22.441
How would that make you feel?

27:22.441 --> 27:24.677
- I'm Dennis Howard.

27:24.677 --> 27:25.978
I'm the tech guy for S.I.G.N.S..

27:25.978 --> 27:27.446
I'm in charge of the equipment

27:27.446 --> 27:31.283
and examining any evidence
that we might collect.

27:31.283 --> 27:33.920
You know, if you ask me,
this whole thing is a hoax.

27:33.920 --> 27:35.722
Think about it.

27:35.722 --> 27:38.090
This husband and wife own

27:38.090 --> 27:39.859
a paranormal website.

27:41.060 --> 27:43.062
What better way to drum
up a little publicity

27:43.062 --> 27:45.164
than have one of you go missing.

27:45.164 --> 27:46.398
She's probably sitting
on a beach somewhere

27:46.398 --> 27:49.568
drinking a fucking
margarita right now.

27:49.568 --> 27:51.303
- Hi, I'm Lynn Baker.

27:52.905 --> 27:55.241
I am Lucas's younger sister

27:55.241 --> 27:57.176
and I guess you could say

27:57.176 --> 28:00.713
I am the groups
resident psychic medium.

28:00.713 --> 28:03.415
Yeah I don't have
a lot to say about

28:03.415 --> 28:05.184
this other than the
fact that I have

28:05.184 --> 28:07.653
a really bad feeling about it.

28:07.653 --> 28:09.421
- My name if Kurt Schafer.

28:09.421 --> 28:11.991
And I guess you could
say that I'm a filmmaker.

28:11.991 --> 28:14.693
I've done some short films and

28:14.693 --> 28:16.863
a couple of music videos
for my brother's band.

28:16.863 --> 28:18.630
Actually that's how
Lucas contacted me.

28:18.630 --> 28:20.232
He's friends with
my brother Nathan.

28:20.232 --> 28:23.569
So he called me
and it was his idea

28:23.569 --> 28:25.872
to try to turn this whole
thing into a documentary.

28:25.872 --> 28:28.607
- I agreed to be a
part of the documentary

28:28.607 --> 28:30.743
in hopes of clearing my name.

28:30.743 --> 28:32.779
- I mean I've heard
of the Devil's Well,

28:32.779 --> 28:34.646
a lot of people have.

28:34.646 --> 28:36.282
I've just never
been there myself

28:36.282 --> 28:39.085
and I don't even know if I
believe any of the stories.

28:39.085 --> 28:41.888
If I'm being honest,
I'm really not

28:41.888 --> 28:44.490
that excited to be going there.

28:45.657 --> 28:48.660
- That's why I wanna
go back to that place.

28:48.660 --> 28:51.363
I don't necessarily think that

28:51.363 --> 28:53.933
we're gonna find Karla but,

28:53.933 --> 28:56.202
if we can prove that
there's something

28:56.202 --> 28:59.038
paranormal going
on in that place,

29:01.073 --> 29:04.110
maybe someone will
finally believe me.

29:25.697 --> 29:27.199
- Most of my life I guess.

29:27.199 --> 29:29.101
- Most of all my life.

29:29.101 --> 29:32.504
It's a good town
with good people.

29:32.504 --> 29:33.772
- Yeah I've heard of it.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.909
- Yeah of course, of
course, we all have.

29:38.010 --> 29:39.245
- No, I'm too
scared to go there.

29:39.245 --> 29:40.379
- Yeah I've been up there.

29:40.379 --> 29:42.314
- Yeah, me too.

29:42.314 --> 29:43.850
- Naw, definitely not.

29:43.850 --> 29:45.918
I've never been there and
I don't plan on it either.

29:45.918 --> 29:48.420
Just an unholy place to go to.

29:48.420 --> 29:50.589
- Oh, are you guys
here about that crap?

29:50.589 --> 29:52.091
Just go away and
leave this town alone

29:52.091 --> 29:53.960
and stop exploiting us please.

29:53.960 --> 29:55.461
- You know, after
that girl disappeared

29:55.461 --> 29:57.930
we had all sorts of
people like you up here

29:57.930 --> 30:00.266
taking photo's,
asking questions.

30:00.266 --> 30:01.500
- Kids in high
school used to go up

30:01.500 --> 30:04.036
and they used to
have these stories.

30:04.036 --> 30:05.537
The stories kind of scared me.

30:05.537 --> 30:06.939
- You know, it's just a
bunch of high school kids,

30:06.939 --> 30:09.508
wanna be satanists
hanging out up there.

30:09.508 --> 30:12.278
They say they hear crazy
sounds, stuff like that.

30:12.278 --> 30:14.713
But they go up there
expecting to get scared

30:14.713 --> 30:16.182
and so they do.

30:16.182 --> 30:18.284
But I don't think the
place is actually haunted.

30:18.284 --> 30:19.818
- Yeah my sister went
up there in high school

30:19.818 --> 30:22.154
with some of her
friends and she said

30:22.154 --> 30:24.790
one of the girls
that she was with

30:24.790 --> 30:28.961
supposedly got like, scratched
by a ghost or something.

30:30.429 --> 30:31.763
- I mean I don't know
if it has anything

30:31.763 --> 30:34.867
to do with ghosts or
anything like that,

30:34.867 --> 30:38.370
but when I was in the
basement I got really dizzy

30:38.370 --> 30:39.705
and I felt sick.

30:40.772 --> 30:41.974
But as soon as I went outside

30:41.974 --> 30:44.610
I immediately felt better.

30:44.610 --> 30:47.313
- Look, what we have are
a bunch of young kids

30:47.313 --> 30:50.082
up there drinking, taking drugs,

30:50.082 --> 30:52.684
carousing, they're in
an abandoned building

30:52.684 --> 30:56.088
above an old well,
that's all it is.

30:56.088 --> 30:58.857
- It's just not a
good place to go.

30:58.857 --> 31:02.094
And if you plan on going
down there, just don't.

31:02.094 --> 31:03.529
You start messing
around with the devil

31:03.529 --> 31:05.797
and that devil start
messing around with you,

31:05.797 --> 31:07.299
understand?

32:08.961 --> 32:10.029
- Are we rolling?

32:10.029 --> 32:11.497
- Yeah we're rolling.

32:11.497 --> 32:13.732
- Bryan, you wanna lead the way?

32:13.732 --> 32:15.267
- Yeah, sure.

32:15.267 --> 32:16.835
It's down this way.

33:03.349 --> 33:05.584
- Let's keep going.

33:18.397 --> 33:20.166
- We're almost there.

33:21.133 --> 33:23.369
It should be right up here.

33:35.814 --> 33:36.982
It's in there.

33:38.484 --> 33:39.685
- Okay.

33:39.685 --> 33:41.953
Guys hang back for a second.

33:41.953 --> 33:42.788
Bryan.

33:43.689 --> 33:46.024
Go in first and I'll follow.

34:09.581 --> 34:11.350
What are you feeling?

34:15.321 --> 34:20.326
- This is the last place
Karla stood before I lost her.

34:20.326 --> 34:23.529
We still have no
idea where she is,

34:23.529 --> 34:25.297
what happened to her.

34:27.833 --> 34:29.668
I'm sorry, it's just
a little overwhelming.

34:29.668 --> 34:31.303
- It's okay.

34:31.303 --> 34:33.472
It's okay, take your time.

34:37.342 --> 34:39.010
- I just left her down there.

34:39.010 --> 34:41.280
- Hey, it's not your fault.

34:42.447 --> 34:44.616
We're here now to get answers.

34:44.616 --> 34:45.451
Okay?

34:51.822 --> 34:54.659
- Look, I think maybe
this was a bad idea okay?

34:54.659 --> 34:56.195
Whatever happened here
could happen any one of you.

34:56.195 --> 34:57.563
I can't be held
responsible for that.

34:57.563 --> 34:59.365
- We're all here by choice.

34:59.365 --> 35:02.268
We all knew the risk of
coming to a place like this.

35:02.268 --> 35:04.703
Focus on what we're here for.

35:29.828 --> 35:30.662
Bryan.

35:33.532 --> 35:34.366
Bryan!

35:36.067 --> 35:36.902
Bryan.

35:38.437 --> 35:39.705
Hey talk to me.

35:41.307 --> 35:42.140
- Sorry.

35:45.010 --> 35:45.944
I couldn't be in there.

35:45.944 --> 35:46.778
I just...

35:49.815 --> 35:51.250
Feeling of dread.

35:52.484 --> 35:53.585
- Okay, okay.

35:55.454 --> 35:57.956
Take a couple minutes alright?

36:00.359 --> 36:03.629
Alright guys, let's
set up the generator.

36:03.629 --> 36:04.963
Let's get some lights hanging.

36:04.963 --> 36:05.797
We got some work to do.

36:05.797 --> 36:06.965
Let's go guys.

36:13.205 --> 36:14.039
Alright.

36:15.374 --> 36:18.109
We're here, it's
gonna be alright.

36:35.694 --> 36:36.528
- Hey Lucas.

36:36.528 --> 36:37.763
- Yeah.

36:37.763 --> 36:38.997
- Where do
you want me to get?

36:38.997 --> 36:41.032
- Just get shots of
everybody setting up.

36:41.032 --> 36:41.867
Yup.

36:41.867 --> 36:43.769
- Okay cool.

37:08.727 --> 37:09.895
Hey, you busy?

37:11.730 --> 37:12.664
- No.

37:12.664 --> 37:13.799
- Can I grab you

37:13.799 --> 37:16.535
for a quick interview
or something?

37:16.535 --> 37:17.969
- Yeah I guess.

37:17.969 --> 37:20.205
- I asked everybody
else why they ghost hunt

37:20.205 --> 37:21.340
and I've never asked you.

37:21.340 --> 37:23.275
So I guess I'm just curious.

37:23.275 --> 37:24.876
Why do you do this?

37:26.478 --> 37:27.746
- It's a good question.

37:27.746 --> 37:29.247
- Hey Kurt, mind if I
grab you for a second?

37:29.247 --> 37:30.382
I need you for a few shots.

37:30.382 --> 37:31.617
- Oh yeah yeah.

37:31.617 --> 37:33.452
Alright, we'll finish
this later alright?

37:33.452 --> 37:34.286
- Yeah.

37:46.932 --> 37:48.367
- Kris to Dennis.

37:49.468 --> 37:50.802
- Go for Dennis.

37:51.937 --> 37:55.273
- How's camera
one looking, over.

37:56.575 --> 37:58.810
- Naw, it's looking
good, picture's clear.

37:58.810 --> 38:02.247
But adjust the camera to
the left a little bit.

38:02.247 --> 38:03.248
- Copy that.

38:05.884 --> 38:08.286
Wait, my left or yours, over.

38:08.286 --> 38:10.956
- Camera left, your right, over.

38:11.957 --> 38:13.759
- Copy that, stand by.

38:19.264 --> 38:21.467
How 'bout now, over.

38:21.467 --> 38:24.370
- That looks good, move
on to the next one over.

38:24.370 --> 38:25.971
- Copy that.

38:30.842 --> 38:32.344
- Dennis to Riley.

38:34.813 --> 38:36.582
- Go for Riley.

38:36.582 --> 38:39.785
- How is everything
going down there?

38:39.785 --> 38:42.320
- Are you seriously
checking up on me?

38:42.320 --> 38:45.457
- Hey, I just want
you to know that

38:45.457 --> 38:48.727
I got my eye on you in case
anything happens down there.

38:48.727 --> 38:50.462
- Dennis
don't be a creeper.

38:50.462 --> 38:53.732
- Hey, I'm just
trying to help out.

38:53.732 --> 38:55.801
- Alright, well I'm
heading back now.

38:55.801 --> 38:57.903
- Copy that, sounds good.

39:26.765 --> 39:27.699
- Hey Lucas.

39:27.699 --> 39:28.900
- Yeah.

39:28.900 --> 39:32.938
- What's your
sister doing over there?

39:32.938 --> 39:34.606
- Let's go find out.

39:44.916 --> 39:47.486
So what are you feeling?

39:47.486 --> 39:49.220
- Nothing good.

39:49.220 --> 39:50.722
- That's to be
expected though right?

39:50.722 --> 39:55.260
I mean there's supposed to be
a gateway to hell down here.

39:55.260 --> 39:57.829
- Let's hope that's not true.

39:57.829 --> 40:01.166
- If it isn't then
why did we come here?

40:13.178 --> 40:15.413
Alright team, let's get started.

40:15.413 --> 40:18.083
Riley I want you and Kris
to go explore the hallways.

40:18.083 --> 40:20.018
Kurt, stay with them.

40:20.018 --> 40:21.219
- Okay.

40:21.219 --> 40:22.287
- Lynn and I will
investigate the well.

40:22.287 --> 40:24.656
Dennis, you know your job.

40:24.656 --> 40:26.091
- What about me?

40:26.091 --> 40:27.292
- I'm gonna have
you stay behind,

40:27.292 --> 40:29.127
help Dennis keep an eye
on the monitors now.

40:29.127 --> 40:30.061
I'll come get you in a bit

40:30.061 --> 40:31.563
and we'll investigate together.

40:31.563 --> 40:33.832
Give us about an hour and
then come meet us back here.

40:33.832 --> 40:34.666
- Sounds good dude.

40:34.666 --> 40:35.501
- Cool.

40:35.501 --> 40:36.334
- Let's roll.

40:36.334 --> 40:37.168
- Let's go.

40:37.168 --> 40:38.336
- Let's do it!

41:27.485 --> 41:31.289
- I mean I'm not hearing
anything yet anyway.

41:31.289 --> 41:33.291
- I don't hear much.

41:33.291 --> 41:34.125
Yeah.

41:35.326 --> 41:37.228
What's this doing here?

41:38.997 --> 41:41.667
- It's a pair of gloves.

41:42.868 --> 41:46.004
- They've
been here a while.

41:56.682 --> 41:59.250
Apparently Big Daddy was here.

41:59.250 --> 42:00.485
Whoever that is.

42:00.485 --> 42:01.920
- It
was here back when

42:01.920 --> 42:02.854
they were still doing
graffiti with a paintbrush.

42:16.802 --> 42:18.937
It says pussy cafe huh?

42:18.937 --> 42:20.806
- It says pussy cafe.
- They're fresh out

42:20.806 --> 42:22.307
- of everything.

42:22.307 --> 42:23.609
I don't think the
pussy cafe is open.

42:23.609 --> 42:25.276
- No I definitely don't.

42:25.276 --> 42:26.712
- I don't think so either.

42:26.712 --> 42:28.346
Come on, that's
the best you got?

42:28.346 --> 42:30.448
- No ghosts
in there either.

42:30.448 --> 42:31.617
- Alright then.

42:31.617 --> 42:34.886
We'll have to look through these

42:34.886 --> 42:36.487
later to see if
anything pops up.

42:36.487 --> 42:38.489
- Yeah yeah, definitely.

42:40.258 --> 42:42.160
Also the silhouette
of a naked woman.

42:42.160 --> 42:43.094
135 pounds.

42:45.631 --> 42:47.498
- Well.

42:47.498 --> 42:49.635
- She's got
that nice hourglass.

42:49.635 --> 42:51.336
- Alright guys.

42:51.336 --> 42:52.771
- Part
of the Pussy Cafe.

42:54.740 --> 42:57.442
- Well no, there are
actual dates on the other side

42:57.442 --> 42:59.077
passed the naked woman.

42:59.077 --> 43:01.680
But clearly you didn't see that.

43:02.714 --> 43:03.815
- Wait hold on.

43:03.815 --> 43:06.584
I actually just heard something.

43:06.584 --> 43:09.755
Like seriously I
just heard something.

43:12.924 --> 43:15.226
- Meter's still low.

43:15.226 --> 43:16.662
Not zero but low.

43:17.696 --> 43:19.297
- Let's keep going.

43:58.269 --> 43:59.237
- Riley.

43:59.237 --> 44:00.471
- Huh?

44:00.471 --> 44:01.139
- What camera
did you put down here?

44:01.139 --> 44:02.073
- Four.

44:02.073 --> 44:03.308
- Why don't you radio Dennis

44:03.308 --> 44:04.509
and let him know
we're approaching.

44:04.509 --> 44:05.510
He likes to keep
tabs on us you know.

44:05.510 --> 44:07.378
- Yes he does.

44:07.378 --> 44:08.446
Riley Dennis.

44:10.982 --> 44:12.984
- Go for Dennis.

44:12.984 --> 44:15.787
- Kris and I are
approaching camera four.

44:15.787 --> 44:17.288
- Yeah roger that.

44:18.389 --> 44:20.258
Riley and Kris are
approaching camera four,

44:20.258 --> 44:21.592
make a note of that.

44:21.592 --> 44:22.427
- Yeah.

44:26.798 --> 44:27.632
Okay.

44:30.702 --> 44:31.536
Got it.

44:39.144 --> 44:42.748
So how long have you
been doing all this?

44:42.748 --> 44:46.584
- I've been doing this
for about 12 years now.

44:47.953 --> 44:50.688
You know, this stuff has
always kind of fascinated me.

44:50.688 --> 44:54.192
But I guess you
could say that I'm

44:54.192 --> 44:56.627
the skeptic of the team.

44:56.627 --> 44:57.996
You know, I like to
think that I bring in

44:57.996 --> 45:00.631
necessary cynicism to the group.

45:01.967 --> 45:05.971
- Do you deal with
S.I.G.N.S. the whole time?

45:05.971 --> 45:07.538
- No, I've only
been with S.I.G.N.S.

45:07.538 --> 45:08.974
for about five years now.

45:08.974 --> 45:11.376
Kris and Lucas, they
were together before that

45:11.376 --> 45:14.445
and they asked me to join up.

45:14.445 --> 45:15.380
- I've been meaning to ask,

45:15.380 --> 45:17.482
what's the deal with Kris?

45:18.649 --> 45:20.318
- What with the gun?

45:20.318 --> 45:22.620
- Yeah, I mean who brings

45:22.620 --> 45:24.489
a gun on a ghost hunt?

45:24.489 --> 45:25.490
- I don't know.

45:25.490 --> 45:28.359
That's always been his thing.

45:28.359 --> 45:30.996
Don't worry, he's got a permit.

45:30.996 --> 45:34.299
- Okay but, you can't
exactly shoot a ghost so...

45:34.299 --> 45:38.203
- Who said anything
about shooting a ghost?

45:38.203 --> 45:41.206
You know, these places,
they tend to attract

45:41.206 --> 45:42.908
some weird types.

45:42.908 --> 45:45.410
You never know
who or what you'll

45:45.410 --> 45:47.712
run into around here.

45:47.712 --> 45:50.148
There was this one time we
were in upstate New York.

45:50.148 --> 45:53.151
We were at an
abandoned hospital.

45:53.151 --> 45:56.121
And we come upon
a pack of wolves.

45:56.121 --> 45:58.189
Kris fires his gun in
the air a couple times,

45:58.189 --> 45:59.124
scares them off.

45:59.124 --> 46:01.592
It was actually pretty bad ass.

46:01.592 --> 46:05.964
- Yeah, I guess it makes sense
when you put it like that.

46:05.964 --> 46:07.432
- You know, to be honest,

46:07.432 --> 46:10.301
I'm happy he has it
with him tonight.

46:10.301 --> 46:11.402
- Why's that?

46:12.603 --> 46:15.540
- I'm not sure that
any of us trust you.

46:26.684 --> 46:28.553
- Check it out.

46:28.553 --> 46:29.387
- Huh?

46:29.387 --> 46:30.388
- See.

46:30.388 --> 46:31.222
A door.

46:34.559 --> 46:37.062
- It's a very industrial door.

46:39.564 --> 46:40.398
Whoa!

46:40.398 --> 46:42.233
- Holy shit.

46:42.233 --> 46:43.234
- What,
what's in there?

46:43.234 --> 46:44.469
- Look at this.

46:44.469 --> 46:47.738
- A big
piece of machinery.

46:47.738 --> 46:50.075
- This thing's huge.

46:51.576 --> 46:53.211
- There's
two more of 'em.

46:53.211 --> 46:54.045
Holy shit!

46:55.113 --> 46:56.347
What the fuck?!

47:05.056 --> 47:07.959
What do you think
about this place?

47:07.959 --> 47:09.427
I mean like in general.

47:09.427 --> 47:12.597
- It definitely has a weird
vibe, I'll give it that.

47:12.597 --> 47:14.565
- A weird vibe?

47:14.565 --> 47:16.667
It's no weirder than any of

47:16.667 --> 47:18.503
the other places we've been in.

47:18.503 --> 47:20.638
- I'm pretty sure this is worse.

47:20.638 --> 47:21.472
- Really?

47:21.472 --> 47:22.307
- Yeah.

47:22.307 --> 47:23.574
- Why?

47:23.574 --> 47:24.709
- I don't know,

47:24.709 --> 47:25.944
there's just
something in the air

47:25.944 --> 47:28.279
it's like really unsettling.

47:28.279 --> 47:30.048
- You don't really
think that well in there

47:30.048 --> 47:32.750
is a portal to hell do you?

47:32.750 --> 47:35.853
- I can see why people
would think that.

47:35.853 --> 47:38.289
- Why, 'cause it's in a
dark and creepy basement?

47:38.289 --> 47:39.124
- Exactly.

47:39.124 --> 47:40.491
- Come on.

47:40.491 --> 47:41.426
I mean if you think about it,

47:41.426 --> 47:42.793
like really think about it,

47:42.793 --> 47:44.395
heaven is always
in the sky right?

47:44.395 --> 47:45.897
And hell's always in the ground.

47:45.897 --> 47:47.966
But we know that if I start
drilling a hole right now

47:47.966 --> 47:49.467
I'm not gonna get to hell.

47:49.467 --> 47:50.701
It's not really true.

47:50.701 --> 47:52.437
So like, why does
a portal to hell

47:52.437 --> 47:54.940
have to be in the dark
in a creepy basement?

47:54.940 --> 47:56.942
Couldn't it be anywhere?

47:59.210 --> 48:00.878
- I mean maybe
that's your answer.

48:00.878 --> 48:02.747
People associate
the sky with heaven

48:02.747 --> 48:04.983
and hell with being underground.

48:04.983 --> 48:06.217
So if there is a portal to hell

48:06.217 --> 48:07.718
it's gonna be in
a place like this

48:07.718 --> 48:12.190
because it's exactly where
people expect it to be.

48:12.190 --> 48:13.758
- So, you're saying

48:14.926 --> 48:18.263
that if that well
was a portal to hell,

48:18.263 --> 48:20.431
it would appear in
a place like this

48:20.431 --> 48:22.400
precisely because
that's where we

48:22.400 --> 48:24.802
would expect it to be?

48:24.802 --> 48:28.039
- Kris that's exactly
what I just said.

48:29.740 --> 48:31.176
- That's interesting.

48:31.176 --> 48:32.443
Very interesting.

48:32.443 --> 48:35.280
I still don't think
it's a portal to hell.

48:35.280 --> 48:36.914
- Think what you will.

48:36.914 --> 48:39.985
Look, is that not
hair or is that

48:39.985 --> 48:42.053
just really dusty spiderwebs?

48:42.053 --> 48:43.121
I can't tell.

48:45.323 --> 48:47.125
- It might be a hair.

48:47.125 --> 48:48.293
Why would there be hair on that?

48:48.293 --> 48:50.495
- I don't know.

48:50.495 --> 48:51.562
I can't tell.

48:55.766 --> 48:56.601
- Is that you?

48:56.601 --> 48:57.468
- Did you hear that?

48:57.468 --> 48:58.469
Is that you?

48:59.670 --> 49:01.672
Is it going off?

49:16.221 --> 49:17.555
What's in there?

49:25.796 --> 49:26.631
- Can
you see in there?

49:26.631 --> 49:28.433
- No it's just dark.

49:28.433 --> 49:29.434
- Is your
meter still going off?

49:29.434 --> 49:30.801
- No, it stopped as soon as I...

49:36.174 --> 49:37.008
- This is--

49:37.008 --> 49:38.576
- It's going crazy.

49:40.011 --> 49:41.712
- Is there anything
in your photos or anything?

49:41.712 --> 49:43.548
- Check it.

49:46.717 --> 49:47.718
- Let's see.

49:49.554 --> 49:51.556
- Oh
shit, it stopped.

49:51.556 --> 49:52.390
- Hold on.

49:56.327 --> 49:57.962
- No.

49:57.962 --> 49:58.829
- Nothing.

49:58.829 --> 50:00.531
- Nothing.

50:00.531 --> 50:01.899
- Got something to report.

50:01.899 --> 50:03.301
Radio Dennis and let him know.

50:03.301 --> 50:04.702
- Alright.

51:10.067 --> 51:11.836
- What is it?

51:14.739 --> 51:16.841
- There's definitely
a strong concentration

51:16.841 --> 51:18.609
of energy right here.

51:22.380 --> 51:23.381
Dark energy.

51:25.483 --> 51:27.718
- EMF is normal.

51:29.820 --> 51:32.523
- Feel over this, it's
colder over this well

51:32.523 --> 51:34.992
than it is in the
rest of the room.

51:34.992 --> 51:36.161
You feel that?

51:36.161 --> 51:37.262
- Yeah, I do.

51:39.330 --> 51:42.900
I'm gonna take the
temperature of the well.

51:43.801 --> 51:45.136
Lucas to Dennis.

51:46.036 --> 51:47.405
- Go for Dennis.

51:47.405 --> 51:50.575
- Can you give me a temperature
readout of the room?

51:50.575 --> 51:51.409
- Standby.

51:56.347 --> 52:00.485
Yeah, your room is reading
at a steady 61 degrees.

52:01.919 --> 52:04.222
- Copy that, I'm gonna take a
thermal reading of the well.

52:04.222 --> 52:05.055
Standby.

52:10.528 --> 52:12.997
The well is reading
at 43 degrees.

52:12.997 --> 52:15.200
Once again that's
four three degrees.

52:15.200 --> 52:16.033
Over.

52:17.101 --> 52:19.103
- Copy that, 43 degrees.

52:22.673 --> 52:25.410
- It's kind of strange right?

52:25.410 --> 52:27.445
- Well, the water's cold

52:27.445 --> 52:31.148
so the well is probably
reading colder.

52:31.148 --> 52:34.752
- Yeah but, that's almost
a 20 degree difference.

52:34.752 --> 52:36.086
- Yeah but the water's probably

52:36.086 --> 52:37.688
coming up from pretty deep.

52:37.688 --> 52:39.357
So I don't think
it's anything to

52:39.357 --> 52:41.526
really get worked up over.

52:47.865 --> 52:51.469
- I feel like there's
someone here with us.

52:54.672 --> 52:55.506
A woman.

52:56.441 --> 52:57.775
Or a girl maybe.

53:01.045 --> 53:03.548
Ugh, I hear a woman screaming.

53:05.616 --> 53:06.784
Several women.

53:08.986 --> 53:09.820
There's something else.

53:09.820 --> 53:10.655
I feel

53:12.857 --> 53:14.359
a male presence too

53:14.359 --> 53:16.026
but his energy is...

53:19.930 --> 53:24.335
It feels like they're
being controlled by him

53:24.335 --> 53:25.336
in some way.

53:26.737 --> 53:29.674
He does not feel
human, he feels...

53:32.243 --> 53:34.279
The girl, the first girl
who jumped in the well,

53:34.279 --> 53:35.179
I feel her.

53:37.882 --> 53:39.550
- Well what about that recording

53:39.550 --> 53:42.219
that the crime scene woman took?

53:43.053 --> 53:45.022
- What about it?

53:45.022 --> 53:46.924
- What are your thoughts on it?

53:46.924 --> 53:49.026
I mean she's a third party,

53:49.026 --> 53:53.097
she has nothing to gain
from any of this so what?

53:55.099 --> 53:57.302
- Well she made that
recording after they

53:57.302 --> 53:59.537
drained the well right?

53:59.537 --> 54:00.771
- Yeah.

54:00.771 --> 54:02.273
- Alright, then it's
probably just air

54:02.273 --> 54:06.243
rushing out of the hole
and distorting the mikes.

54:06.243 --> 54:09.347
- Yeah, I guess
that's a possibility.

54:12.249 --> 54:14.919
- Is there someone here with us?

54:16.487 --> 54:18.122
I can feel you.

54:18.122 --> 54:19.790
- Call their name.

54:19.790 --> 54:21.225
Mary, Mary Woods.

54:22.993 --> 54:23.828
- Mary.

54:26.764 --> 54:28.265
Is that you honey?

54:31.001 --> 54:32.670
It's okay if you
want to talk to me,

54:32.670 --> 54:34.439
I'm here to help you.

54:42.179 --> 54:43.914
- What is it?

54:45.483 --> 54:46.317
Lynn.

54:47.785 --> 54:49.286
Lynn what's wrong?

54:50.855 --> 54:52.357
- Get out get out!

54:54.659 --> 54:56.861
- Lynn, Lynn Jesus.

54:56.861 --> 54:58.629
Lynn come back to me!

55:01.065 --> 55:01.899
Lynn are you okay?

55:01.899 --> 55:03.934
What the fuck happened?

55:03.934 --> 55:04.769
- Oh god.

55:06.036 --> 55:06.871
Something,

55:08.539 --> 55:09.540
something got inside me.

55:09.540 --> 55:10.408
Where are you?

55:10.408 --> 55:13.210
Something got inside me.

55:13.210 --> 55:14.812
- Okay.

55:14.812 --> 55:18.649
Okay alright, let's get
you in the other room.

55:26.891 --> 55:28.859
- What the hell was all
that screaming about?

55:28.859 --> 55:30.127
- I don't know.

55:30.127 --> 55:30.928
Something happened
to Lynn in there.

55:30.928 --> 55:32.262
- Here, sit her down.

55:33.197 --> 55:35.800
- Here, keep recording.

55:40.405 --> 55:42.807
How are you feeling?

55:42.807 --> 55:45.743
- Sorry, I had to
get out of there.

55:47.478 --> 55:50.214
Whatever is in there
overpowered me.

55:50.214 --> 55:53.884
- Okay look, what exactly
happened in there?

55:54.952 --> 55:57.455
- I'll play back the recorder.

56:01.358 --> 56:02.527
- Mary.

56:05.162 --> 56:06.831
Is that you honey?

56:08.733 --> 56:10.267
- Stop, right there.

56:10.267 --> 56:11.201
Did you hear that?

56:11.201 --> 56:13.203
It sounded like growling.

56:15.406 --> 56:16.474
Play it back.

56:19.677 --> 56:20.845
- Mary.

56:23.448 --> 56:25.282
Is that you honey?

56:25.282 --> 56:26.584
- Right there.

56:26.584 --> 56:28.653
- Yeah, yeah
I heard it that time.

56:28.653 --> 56:29.787
- There is definitely
something else

56:29.787 --> 56:31.055
in there with us.

56:31.055 --> 56:32.990
- Look, let me put it
through a few filters,

56:32.990 --> 56:35.292
clean it up, see exactly
what we're dealing with.

56:35.292 --> 56:36.827
- Alright, work on it.

56:36.827 --> 56:38.128
I'm going back in there.

56:38.128 --> 56:39.430
Bryan, you're coming with me.

56:39.430 --> 56:40.898
- Okay.

56:40.898 --> 56:42.733
- Lynn you stay here with
Dennis until you feel better.

56:42.733 --> 56:43.568
- Okay.

56:44.535 --> 56:45.470
- Let's go.

56:53.878 --> 56:55.646
- No sign of
anybody down here huh?

56:55.646 --> 56:56.781
- No it's pretty quiet.

56:56.781 --> 56:58.082
- Yeah pretty quiet.

56:58.082 --> 56:59.316
- Watch your head guys.

56:59.316 --> 57:00.150
- Thanks.

57:00.918 --> 57:02.252
Doing alright Kurt?

57:02.252 --> 57:05.590
- Yeah, I'm
doing alright I guess.

57:05.590 --> 57:08.358
- What do you think
about all this?

57:08.358 --> 57:09.860
- Honestly I don't know.

57:09.860 --> 57:11.195
It's not really my thing.

57:11.195 --> 57:12.429
- It's not your thing?

57:12.429 --> 57:13.664
- Yeah.

57:13.664 --> 57:14.965
- Then why did you
agree to come along?

57:14.965 --> 57:16.166
- I don't know.

57:16.166 --> 57:17.434
I don't know, Lucas
just called me

57:17.434 --> 57:19.704
and asked me to do
this documentary.

57:19.704 --> 57:20.971
I really didn't know I was gonna

57:20.971 --> 57:22.339
be coming here with you guys.

57:22.339 --> 57:23.273
- Are you serious dude?

57:23.273 --> 57:24.108
- Yeah I'm serious.

57:24.108 --> 57:25.576
- Holy shit.

57:25.576 --> 57:29.146
So you don't believe in ghosts
or are you scared of 'em?

57:29.146 --> 57:30.447
- Maybe a little
bit of both I guess.

57:30.447 --> 57:32.382
I don't really know.

57:32.382 --> 57:33.618
- Oh come
on, go outside...

57:33.618 --> 57:35.586
- Whoa, whoa,
whoa, what is it?

57:35.586 --> 57:36.487
What is it?

57:40.591 --> 57:41.492
- Shit!

57:41.492 --> 57:42.593
- Fuck!

57:42.593 --> 57:44.061
I swear I saw somebody.

57:44.061 --> 57:45.262
They looked like they
walked across the hallway

57:45.262 --> 57:47.565
and came into this room.

57:47.565 --> 57:48.398
Hello!

57:50.367 --> 57:51.201
Hello!

57:53.604 --> 57:55.706
- Riley to Dennis.

57:55.706 --> 57:56.907
- Go for Dennis.

57:56.907 --> 57:57.908
- Yeah, is there anyone
else in the hallway

57:57.908 --> 57:58.743
or the rooms with us?

57:58.743 --> 58:00.110
- Nothing.

58:00.110 --> 58:02.346
- No, everyone's
down here, why?

58:02.346 --> 58:04.582
- Kris thought he saw
movement in one of the rooms.

58:04.582 --> 58:06.584
So just keep an eye out.

58:07.785 --> 58:10.487
- Copy that, I'll
keep my eyes open.

58:12.723 --> 58:14.659
- I swear I saw something,
it looked like a person.

58:14.659 --> 58:16.226
- I know, I believe you.

58:16.226 --> 58:17.728
- What do you wanna do?

58:17.728 --> 58:18.796
You wanna stay down here
and look around some more

58:18.796 --> 58:20.064
or do you wanna go back?

58:20.064 --> 58:21.031
- No, let's stay here.

58:21.031 --> 58:22.232
We might be on to something.

58:22.232 --> 58:23.701
Why don't you double
check in here,

58:23.701 --> 58:25.435
look around, and I'm gonna
go this way with Kurt.

58:25.435 --> 58:26.904
- Alright I'll cut across here,

58:26.904 --> 58:28.005
you go around, I'll meet
you guys on the other side.

58:28.005 --> 58:29.740
Be careful.

58:29.740 --> 58:32.242
- Do you actually
think he saw something?

58:32.242 --> 58:33.443
- I mean, Kris
fucks around a lot

58:33.443 --> 58:34.945
but he takes his work seriously.

58:34.945 --> 58:36.614
- Oh shit!
- Oh my god!

58:36.614 --> 58:37.447
- Kris!

58:37.447 --> 58:38.816
Kurt what happened?!

58:38.816 --> 58:39.750
- What happened, what happened?!

58:39.750 --> 58:40.885
- I don't know.

58:40.885 --> 58:42.019
- You alright,
you alright?!

58:42.019 --> 58:43.220
- No, something
pushed me man!

58:43.220 --> 58:44.154
- Hey, you
sure you didn't trip?

58:44.154 --> 58:45.322
- No I didn't trip.

58:45.322 --> 58:46.523
- Are you
sure you didn't trip?

58:46.523 --> 58:47.725
- I didn't
fucking trip alright.

58:47.725 --> 58:48.959
Something like pulled
me to the ground.

58:48.959 --> 58:50.227
I wanna head back
with the others.

58:50.227 --> 58:51.028
- Dude, you
can't go anywhere.

58:51.028 --> 58:51.829
You've got a job to do.

58:51.829 --> 58:53.030
Just wait a second!

58:53.030 --> 58:53.964
- No no
you wait a second!

58:53.964 --> 58:55.966
Fuck it, fuck it, I'm out.

58:55.966 --> 58:56.901
- Hey!

58:56.901 --> 58:57.635
- Kris just let him go.

58:57.635 --> 58:58.836
- Kurt!

58:58.836 --> 59:00.337
Kurt!
- Let him go.

59:01.505 --> 59:02.973
- Fuck this
shit man, fuck.

59:06.343 --> 59:07.477
This is fucking bullshit.

59:07.477 --> 59:08.713
Where the fuck am I going?

59:08.713 --> 59:10.247
I don't know where
the fuck I'm going.

59:10.247 --> 59:13.150
Oh god, where the
fuck is this huh?

59:16.120 --> 59:17.788
Okay okay okay okay.

59:20.658 --> 59:21.558
Fuck!

59:21.558 --> 59:22.660
What the fuck was that?

59:22.660 --> 59:23.828
Okay, oh fuck.

59:24.895 --> 59:25.730
Kris!

59:26.931 --> 59:28.232
Riley!

59:28.232 --> 59:29.066
Oh shit!

59:33.537 --> 59:34.672
I thought they were in here.

59:34.672 --> 59:35.505
This room?

59:36.373 --> 59:37.207
Fuck.

59:50.454 --> 59:51.822
Hey where are you guys!

59:51.822 --> 59:52.657
- Hey.

59:52.657 --> 59:53.891
- Oh shit.

59:53.891 --> 59:54.825
- Where the fuck
are you going man?

59:54.825 --> 59:55.626
What the fuck are you doing?

59:55.626 --> 59:56.560
- What's wrong?

59:56.560 --> 59:57.695
- I fucking saw somebody,

59:57.695 --> 59:58.929
- Calm down, calm down.

59:58.929 --> 59:59.596
- At the end of
one of the hallways.

59:59.596 --> 01:00:00.530
- Okay.

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:01.766
- No you guys were right,

01:00:01.766 --> 01:00:03.167
there's like somebody
down here or something.

01:00:03.167 --> 01:00:05.202
I got it on the camera,
I got it in the camera.

01:00:05.202 --> 01:00:06.436
I'll show you guys.

01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:07.938
- Alright, we're
gonna go check in

01:00:07.938 --> 01:00:09.106
with Dennis and the crew
and then see the footage.

01:00:09.106 --> 01:00:10.040
Let's go.

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:11.308
- Take a breath, let's go.

01:00:11.308 --> 01:00:12.810
- Alright,
alright, alright.

01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:13.944
Dude, you guys are right dude.

01:00:13.944 --> 01:00:15.279
There's somebody here.

01:00:15.279 --> 01:00:17.882
Something down
here, I don't know.

01:00:17.882 --> 01:00:19.083
Shit.

01:00:19.083 --> 01:00:20.250
- But you got it,
you got it on camera?

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:21.652
- Yeah,
it's on the camera.

01:00:21.652 --> 01:00:24.822
I'll show you the footage
when we get there.

01:00:31.328 --> 01:00:32.496
- God damn it.

01:00:37.234 --> 01:00:38.736
You feel anything?

01:00:39.804 --> 01:00:41.071
- Yeah.

01:00:41.972 --> 01:00:43.974
It's almost like there's

01:00:46.176 --> 01:00:49.179
some kind of heavy weight
bearing down on me.

01:00:49.179 --> 01:00:51.248
You don't feel that?

01:00:51.248 --> 01:00:52.082
- No.

01:00:54.384 --> 01:00:56.854
- I mean, Lynn
seems to be convinced

01:00:56.854 --> 01:00:58.856
there's something in here.

01:00:58.856 --> 01:01:01.258
Is she usually right
about this kind of stuff?

01:01:01.258 --> 01:01:04.428
- I've never seen
her be wrong before.

01:01:05.863 --> 01:01:09.033
- I don't know if
that's a relief or not.

01:01:09.033 --> 01:01:10.400
- Hey guys, we got
something to look at.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.468
- What's going on?

01:01:11.468 --> 01:01:12.737
- Kurt got pushed in the hallway

01:01:12.737 --> 01:01:14.171
and he also caught
someone on camera.

01:01:14.171 --> 01:01:15.372
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what do you mean?

01:01:15.372 --> 01:01:16.673
- He said he got pushed,
I think he tripped.

01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:18.508
- Are you sure you didn't trip?

01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:19.977
- No, he got pushed.

01:01:19.977 --> 01:01:20.911
- She saw it, she was there.
- I was there, I saw it.

01:01:20.911 --> 01:01:21.712
- Did you see it?

01:01:21.712 --> 01:01:23.213
- My back was turned.

01:01:23.213 --> 01:01:24.014
- I'm telling you, something
like pushed me to the ground.

01:01:24.014 --> 01:01:24.815
It doesn't matter.

01:01:24.815 --> 01:01:26.316
I got footage of like,

01:01:26.316 --> 01:01:28.085
I don't know, I think it's
somebody in the hallway.

01:01:28.085 --> 01:01:29.219
You guys should see it alright.

01:01:29.219 --> 01:01:30.988
Just hold on.

01:01:30.988 --> 01:01:33.858
- Look, do I believe
something is happening here?

01:01:33.858 --> 01:01:36.360
Yeah I believe you, it's just,

01:01:37.762 --> 01:01:41.098
the whole point was to come
down here and get proof.

01:01:41.098 --> 01:01:44.234
Static on a digital
recorder is not enough.

01:01:44.234 --> 01:01:45.235
I need more.

01:01:48.438 --> 01:01:49.639
- Do you think it's possible

01:01:49.639 --> 01:01:52.242
this well is a gateway to hell?

01:01:57.047 --> 01:02:00.050
- Look, I don't believe
in heaven or hell.

01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:01.451
Not in the traditional
sense anyway.

01:02:01.451 --> 01:02:03.153
I believe in energy.

01:02:03.153 --> 01:02:05.222
Energy is something
that you can measure

01:02:05.222 --> 01:02:06.556
and that you can feel.

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:08.826
And there's a clear
distinction between

01:02:08.826 --> 01:02:10.227
positive and negative energy.

01:02:10.227 --> 01:02:12.062
And certain places
tend to act as magnets,

01:02:12.062 --> 01:02:13.030
like this well.

01:02:13.030 --> 01:02:14.832
But for whatever reason,

01:02:14.832 --> 01:02:16.166
maybe because of
all the dark things

01:02:16.166 --> 01:02:17.401
that have happened
here, you guys

01:02:17.401 --> 01:02:20.237
are feeling a lot
of negative energy.

01:02:22.272 --> 01:02:23.808
I need more.

01:02:23.808 --> 01:02:26.110
I need evidence, I need to
be able to prove it or...

01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:26.944
- Fuck!

01:02:26.944 --> 01:02:27.878
Right there!

01:02:27.878 --> 01:02:28.612
- What the fuck was that?

01:02:28.612 --> 01:02:29.880
- See that!

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:31.148
That was somebody in the
hallway with me alright.

01:02:31.148 --> 01:02:32.416
- That's not one of us.

01:02:32.416 --> 01:02:33.517
- It's a person.

01:02:33.517 --> 01:02:34.518
- I swear to god.

01:02:34.518 --> 01:02:35.953
- Wait, radio Lucas.

01:02:35.953 --> 01:02:37.487
Tell him to get there.

01:02:37.487 --> 01:02:38.989
- Dennis to Lucas.

01:02:39.890 --> 01:02:41.358
- Go for Lucas.

01:02:41.358 --> 01:02:42.592
- Lucas I think
you need to come down here,

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:44.094
Kurt has something
you need to look at.

01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:45.429
- I'm on my way.

01:02:47.664 --> 01:02:49.433
Stay here okay.

01:02:49.433 --> 01:02:51.035
Don't stop filming.

01:02:57.374 --> 01:02:58.809
- This is not good.

01:02:58.809 --> 01:02:59.776
- Okay what do you have?

01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:01.311
- Hey, you gotta see this.

01:03:01.311 --> 01:03:02.546
- Come here.

01:03:02.546 --> 01:03:04.915
Okay, I have to
show you, hold on.

01:03:04.915 --> 01:03:05.749
- Okay.

01:03:07.017 --> 01:03:08.452
- Okay alright.

01:03:08.452 --> 01:03:11.221
Alright I'm going
down the hallways.

01:03:15.259 --> 01:03:16.660
- What?

01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:17.494
Hello?

01:03:30.174 --> 01:03:31.008
Oh my god.

01:03:32.542 --> 01:03:33.377
Karla.

01:03:37.281 --> 01:03:38.115
Karla.

01:03:40.918 --> 01:03:41.852
- Oh fuck!

01:03:41.852 --> 01:03:43.320
Right there, you see that?

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:44.554
You see that?

01:03:44.554 --> 01:03:46.156
There was somebody in
the hallway with me.

01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:46.991
- Play it again.

01:03:46.991 --> 01:03:47.925
- Okay hold on.

01:03:47.925 --> 01:03:49.426
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

01:03:49.426 --> 01:03:53.263
something, something is
going on with camera one.

01:03:53.263 --> 01:03:55.132
- Kris with me, Kurt let's go.

01:03:55.132 --> 01:03:56.300
Kurt let's go!

01:04:00.504 --> 01:04:01.805
- Karla.

01:04:04.942 --> 01:04:06.543
- Oh shit.

01:04:06.543 --> 01:04:07.377
Is that her?

01:04:07.377 --> 01:04:08.979
Shit, is that her?!

01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:12.883
- Hey.
- What the fuck?

01:04:12.883 --> 01:04:14.151
- What's she doing?

01:04:14.151 --> 01:04:14.952
- Karla, my name is
Lucas, Lucas Baker,

01:04:14.952 --> 01:04:15.953
I'm here to help you.

01:04:15.953 --> 01:04:16.921
Do you understand?

01:04:16.921 --> 01:04:18.989
- Karla hey, hey it's me.

01:04:19.924 --> 01:04:20.757
- Go easy.

01:04:20.757 --> 01:04:21.725
- It's Bryan.

01:04:21.725 --> 01:04:23.593
Are you okay?

01:04:23.593 --> 01:04:25.029
Can you talk to me?

01:04:25.029 --> 01:04:26.596
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:04:29.766 --> 01:04:30.867
Are you okay?

01:04:36.473 --> 01:04:39.910
- Go get a blanket,
or a coat, something!

01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:41.145
- It's okay.

01:04:41.145 --> 01:04:42.379
- Where the hell
did she come from?

01:04:42.379 --> 01:04:43.880
- I don't
know, I went out

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:44.548
for two seconds, I come back
and she's standing there.

01:04:44.548 --> 01:04:45.382
Hey!

01:04:46.883 --> 01:04:48.953
- What the fuck is going on?!

01:04:48.953 --> 01:04:49.886
- It's Karla!

01:04:49.886 --> 01:04:50.820
- What?!

01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:52.122
- Karla's in the well room.

01:04:52.122 --> 01:04:53.623
- Are you serious?

01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:03.033
- What the fuck!

01:05:03.033 --> 01:05:04.801
- Okay Kris come here.

01:05:04.801 --> 01:05:07.337
Alright, come upstairs, pull
the van around, call the cops.

01:05:07.337 --> 01:05:08.238
And take a camera with you.

01:05:08.238 --> 01:05:09.173
- Camera?

01:05:09.173 --> 01:05:09.906
- Take the god damn camera!

01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:11.108
- Okay!

01:05:11.108 --> 01:05:12.342
- And that goes
for everybody else!

01:05:12.342 --> 01:05:13.143
I don't know what the
fuck is going on here--

01:05:13.143 --> 01:05:13.810
- I need to talk to you.

01:05:13.810 --> 01:05:14.478
- Not now.

01:05:14.478 --> 01:05:15.479
- Yes now.

01:05:15.479 --> 01:05:16.913
- Fuck.

01:05:16.913 --> 01:05:19.183
- I'm gonna stay with them.

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:25.189
- What is it?

01:05:25.189 --> 01:05:26.123
- Hey look, could
you just get that

01:05:26.123 --> 01:05:27.057
out of my face for a second?

01:05:27.057 --> 01:05:28.258
- No, no, document everything.

01:05:28.258 --> 01:05:29.493
Look, make it quick
because I wanna

01:05:29.493 --> 01:05:30.694
get back in there
and talk to her.

01:05:30.694 --> 01:05:31.628
- That's what I wanna
talk to you about.

01:05:31.628 --> 01:05:33.297
Don't you think this whole thing

01:05:33.297 --> 01:05:35.599
is a little too convenient?

01:05:35.599 --> 01:05:37.201
You leave him alone in that room

01:05:37.201 --> 01:05:38.935
and she just magically appears?

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:40.204
- What are you saying?

01:05:40.204 --> 01:05:42.639
- I'm saying that this
is some sort of a hoax

01:05:42.639 --> 01:05:45.142
or a set up, I don't trust it.

01:05:49.646 --> 01:05:51.615
Lucas just think about it.

01:05:51.615 --> 01:05:53.483
Everything that has
happened down here

01:05:53.483 --> 01:05:55.219
has a rational explanation.

01:05:55.219 --> 01:05:57.154
We are being fucked with.

01:05:57.154 --> 01:05:58.989
- All the more reason
to record everything.

01:05:58.989 --> 01:06:00.490
Okay, either we are
witnessing some amazing

01:06:00.490 --> 01:06:02.292
paranormal event
or we the victims

01:06:02.292 --> 01:06:03.860
of some elaborate hoax.

01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:06.330
Either way, I need evidence.

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:10.134
- Fuck.

01:06:11.335 --> 01:06:13.037
What the fuck?

01:06:13.037 --> 01:06:15.372
Who the fuck locked this?

01:06:15.372 --> 01:06:16.173
Fuck!

01:06:17.341 --> 01:06:18.575
- You know what,

01:06:18.575 --> 01:06:20.044
set up some cameras in here

01:06:20.044 --> 01:06:21.845
because I wanna talk to
her before the cops arrive.

01:06:21.845 --> 01:06:24.381
- We need to wait on the police

01:06:24.381 --> 01:06:26.016
and let them sort this out.

01:06:26.016 --> 01:06:27.251
- No, no.

01:06:27.251 --> 01:06:28.552
Because if this is
actually paranormal

01:06:28.552 --> 01:06:29.953
the police aren't gonna
know what to do with it

01:06:29.953 --> 01:06:31.188
and they'll sweep
it under the rug.

01:06:31.188 --> 01:06:32.822
This is our chance to actually

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:35.825
find out what
happened to that girl.

01:06:37.861 --> 01:06:39.696
This could be big.

01:06:39.696 --> 01:06:41.031
- Lucas!

01:06:41.031 --> 01:06:42.132
Lucas!

01:06:42.132 --> 01:06:43.533
We got a problem man.

01:06:43.533 --> 01:06:44.768
We're locked in here.

01:06:44.768 --> 01:06:46.002
- What do
you mean locked?

01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:46.670
- The door we came
in, it's locked.

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:47.471
- You sure?

01:06:47.471 --> 01:06:49.573
- Yeah, it's locked man!

01:06:49.573 --> 01:06:51.608
- This is what I
am talking about.

01:06:51.608 --> 01:06:53.143
There is something
going on down here

01:06:53.143 --> 01:06:54.644
and I don't think
it's paranormal.

01:06:54.644 --> 01:06:55.579
- What do you mean?

01:06:55.579 --> 01:06:56.380
You think Bryan did this?

01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:57.814
Why would he do that?

01:06:57.814 --> 01:06:59.349
- Because this whole
fucking thing was planned.

01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:00.617
- When would he have done this?

01:07:00.617 --> 01:07:02.686
You were with him
most of the time.

01:07:02.686 --> 01:07:04.488
- And where the hell
did she come from?

01:07:04.488 --> 01:07:06.056
And don't tell me
that fucking hole

01:07:06.056 --> 01:07:08.225
because I'm not buying it.

01:07:09.393 --> 01:07:11.728
- Okay, okay Kris,
find us another

01:07:11.728 --> 01:07:13.830
way out of here, that
couldn't be the only door.

01:07:13.830 --> 01:07:15.132
- Yeah.

01:07:15.132 --> 01:07:17.401
Alright, alright man, come on.

01:07:17.401 --> 01:07:20.003
- Dennis, Dennis,
you may be right

01:07:20.003 --> 01:07:21.438
but the only way
I'm gonna find out

01:07:21.438 --> 01:07:23.207
is if I talk to that girl.

01:07:23.207 --> 01:07:24.040
Agreed?

01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:26.710
- Fine.

01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:27.644
I mean we're stuck down here

01:07:27.644 --> 01:07:28.712
we might as well do something.

01:07:28.712 --> 01:07:29.646
- Good.

01:07:29.646 --> 01:07:30.880
Okay I'm gonna talk to Bryan.

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.782
You set up the cameras.

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:48.398
Has she said anything yet?

01:07:48.398 --> 01:07:49.833
- No, nothing.

01:07:49.833 --> 01:07:51.235
- Alright, let's get her
up in the other room.

01:07:51.235 --> 01:07:52.769
I need to talk to her.

01:07:52.769 --> 01:07:54.204
- What?

01:07:54.204 --> 01:07:55.038
No.

01:07:56.673 --> 01:07:57.607
She's not acting like herself.

01:07:57.607 --> 01:07:58.842
- Well that's the whole point.

01:07:58.842 --> 01:08:00.677
I need to know if
she's acting at all.

01:08:00.677 --> 01:08:01.911
- What are you talking about?

01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:02.912
- Don't you think it's
a little convenient

01:08:02.912 --> 01:08:04.181
that you're down
here by yourself

01:08:04.181 --> 01:08:06.483
and then she just
suddenly appears?

01:08:07.451 --> 01:08:08.818
- I get it.

01:08:08.818 --> 01:08:10.053
So what, you two
think this is just

01:08:10.053 --> 01:08:12.889
some big fucking
hoax or something?

01:08:12.889 --> 01:08:14.124
Let me tell you something.

01:08:14.124 --> 01:08:16.660
Last year my life's been
a god damn nightmare.

01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:17.894
Okay I had no idea
where my wife was

01:08:17.894 --> 01:08:19.263
and everyone's looking
at me like I had

01:08:19.263 --> 01:08:20.497
something to do with it.

01:08:20.497 --> 01:08:22.366
Do you have any idea
what that is like?

01:08:22.366 --> 01:08:24.301
Now she's back proving that
I didn't do anything to her

01:08:24.301 --> 01:08:25.535
and what?

01:08:25.535 --> 01:08:26.470
You guys wanna stand
here and accuse me of

01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:27.937
staging this whole thing?!

01:08:27.937 --> 01:08:29.738
- Listen, it is a possibility
that we have to consider.

01:08:29.738 --> 01:08:30.907
- Oh fuck you man,
I trusted you!

01:08:30.907 --> 01:08:31.841
- Hey!

01:08:31.841 --> 01:08:34.377
Listen okay, I believe you.

01:08:34.377 --> 01:08:35.612
But there are a whole
lot of other people

01:08:35.612 --> 01:08:37.281
out there that won't
and this may be

01:08:37.281 --> 01:08:38.881
your only chance to
stop the accusations

01:08:38.881 --> 01:08:40.116
before they even start.

01:08:40.116 --> 01:08:42.085
And you know that
they're coming.

01:08:42.085 --> 01:08:44.520
Without any proof of
what happened down here,

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:47.023
nobody's gonna believe anything.

01:08:47.023 --> 01:08:48.591
Let me talk to her.

01:08:51.795 --> 01:08:53.095
- Fine.

01:08:53.095 --> 01:08:54.363
But I wanna be in
there when you do it.

01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:55.432
- Absolutely.

01:08:57.533 --> 01:08:59.102
Set up the cameras.

01:09:03.607 --> 01:09:07.611
- Hey, I'll take you to
the other room now okay.

01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:12.148
- Are we rolling?

01:09:12.148 --> 01:09:14.417
- Yeah we're rolling.

01:09:14.417 --> 01:09:16.386
- Dennis do you have a visual?

01:09:16.386 --> 01:09:17.787
- Affirmative.

01:09:17.787 --> 01:09:18.622
- Good.

01:09:19.656 --> 01:09:20.823
Keep an eye on us

01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:23.727
and radio if anything
unusual happens.

01:09:23.727 --> 01:09:25.161
- Copy that.

01:09:25.161 --> 01:09:26.595
This is bullshit.

01:09:27.796 --> 01:09:28.932
- You really think
this is all fake?

01:09:28.932 --> 01:09:30.500
- Yeah I do.

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:32.469
- Well then why the hell
would they bring us down here?

01:09:32.469 --> 01:09:34.904
- We come in here, they start
screwing around with us,

01:09:34.904 --> 01:09:36.805
we claim that this
place is haunted,

01:09:36.805 --> 01:09:39.243
there, we just
validated their story.

01:09:39.243 --> 01:09:41.109
- But there really is
something going on.

01:09:41.109 --> 01:09:42.779
- You don't know
that for sure Riley.

01:09:42.779 --> 01:09:45.615
- Kurt got pushed, Kris and I
saw movement in the hallway,

01:09:45.615 --> 01:09:46.850
we got something on camera.

01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:50.386
- And all of that can
be rationally explained.

01:09:50.386 --> 01:09:51.787
This place has been hyped up.

01:09:51.787 --> 01:09:55.459
We can't let it
get into our heads.

01:09:55.459 --> 01:09:58.562
Look, there may be very well

01:09:58.562 --> 01:10:00.697
something paranormal
going on here.

01:10:00.697 --> 01:10:02.165
All I'm saying is I don't think

01:10:02.165 --> 01:10:04.634
anything happened to Karla.

01:10:04.634 --> 01:10:05.869
Think about it.

01:10:05.869 --> 01:10:08.204
Just take a step back
and think about it.

01:10:08.204 --> 01:10:11.475
Did she just go to hell
and now she's back.

01:10:11.475 --> 01:10:15.245
- Well where the hell
did she come from then?

01:10:21.951 --> 01:10:24.288
- Can you tell me your name?

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:33.229
Do you remember your name?

01:10:45.742 --> 01:10:47.176
It matters to me.

01:10:48.678 --> 01:10:52.115
I need you to tell me your name.

01:10:52.115 --> 01:10:53.550
Bryan, if you say
one more thing,

01:10:53.550 --> 01:10:55.552
we're through here and
you're on your own.

01:10:55.552 --> 01:10:56.486
Understand?

01:10:58.955 --> 01:11:01.190
I need you to tell me your name.

01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:02.426
- We should radio Kris.

01:11:02.426 --> 01:11:04.694
He's been gone for a while.

01:11:08.131 --> 01:11:10.334
- There's someone here.

01:11:10.334 --> 01:11:11.167
- What?

01:11:12.068 --> 01:11:13.537
Where are you going?

01:11:13.537 --> 01:11:14.738
I should follow her.

01:11:14.738 --> 01:11:15.672
She shouldn't be alone.

01:11:15.672 --> 01:11:17.273
- Take a camera.

01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:18.508
- Lynn!

01:11:25.682 --> 01:11:27.684
- Why doesn't it matter?

01:11:36.793 --> 01:11:38.462
What do you mean this world?

01:11:38.462 --> 01:11:40.630
Do you know where you are?

01:11:46.202 --> 01:11:47.671
- Lynn wait.

01:11:47.671 --> 01:11:48.972
Where are you going?

01:11:48.972 --> 01:11:50.239
- They're coming.

01:11:50.239 --> 01:11:51.708
- What?

01:11:51.708 --> 01:11:52.676
Who?

01:11:52.676 --> 01:11:54.310
What are you talking about?

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:55.545
- They're coming.

01:11:55.545 --> 01:11:56.480
- Lynn
you're scaring me.

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:58.147
Where are you going?

01:12:02.285 --> 01:12:05.955
- Do you know how long
you've been gone for?

01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:13.763
You don't know
you've been missing?

01:12:18.968 --> 01:12:20.404
In this building?

01:12:24.474 --> 01:12:26.543
What have you been doing?

01:12:28.712 --> 01:12:30.113
Waiting for what?

01:12:33.417 --> 01:12:34.250
Who?

01:12:46.963 --> 01:12:48.965
- Dennis to Riley.

01:12:48.965 --> 01:12:50.934
- Shit!

01:12:50.934 --> 01:12:52.402
Lynn wait!

01:12:52.402 --> 01:12:53.603
What is it?

01:12:53.603 --> 01:12:54.938
- I just saw movement
by camera five.

01:12:54.938 --> 01:12:56.740
I need you to go check
it out right now.

01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:58.207
- No, Lynn
is acting weird.

01:12:58.207 --> 01:12:59.509
Lynn wait!

01:12:59.509 --> 01:13:01.144
She's acting weird, I
should stay with her.

01:13:01.144 --> 01:13:02.612
- Lynn will be fine.

01:13:02.612 --> 01:13:03.780
If there is somebody
else down there

01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:05.114
we need to know.

01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:07.083
- Look, call Kris.

01:13:07.083 --> 01:13:08.151
Lynn, where are you going?!

01:13:08.151 --> 01:13:09.085
Come back.

01:13:09.085 --> 01:13:09.886
- Kris is nowhere near there,

01:13:09.886 --> 01:13:11.588
just go check it out.

01:13:21.598 --> 01:13:23.767
- Lynn wait, stop!

01:13:27.471 --> 01:13:28.905
Damn it!

01:13:35.945 --> 01:13:38.181
- What the hell is that?

01:13:38.181 --> 01:13:39.015
Kurt.

01:13:39.015 --> 01:13:39.849
- Yeah.

01:13:39.849 --> 01:13:40.684
- Check it out.

01:13:40.684 --> 01:13:41.851
- Okay.

01:13:48.992 --> 01:13:51.127
- Dennis I don't
see anybody here.

01:13:51.127 --> 01:13:53.062
- Dennis, Dennis, shit!

01:13:54.731 --> 01:13:55.732
Oh fuck.

01:13:55.732 --> 01:13:56.633
- Dennis do you copy?

01:13:56.633 --> 01:13:57.467
- Oh fuck.

01:13:58.401 --> 01:13:59.235
- Hello.

01:14:02.906 --> 01:14:04.007
Hello Dennis.

01:14:06.710 --> 01:14:08.044
Riley to Dennis.

01:15:07.737 --> 01:15:10.807
- How long were you
in that room for?

01:15:17.547 --> 01:15:18.381
Why not?

01:15:21.551 --> 01:15:24.621
Was anyone else in
the room with you?

01:15:24.621 --> 01:15:25.454
Who?

01:15:30.226 --> 01:15:31.160
Who is him?

01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:38.902
The one who is coming for?

01:15:46.976 --> 01:15:48.645
Does he have a name?

01:16:02.826 --> 01:16:05.595
- Kris to Dennis.

01:16:05.595 --> 01:16:06.830
Kris to Dennis.

01:16:08.932 --> 01:16:10.099
Kris to Riley.

01:16:11.735 --> 01:16:12.902
Kris to Riley.

01:16:14.604 --> 01:16:16.272
Can anybody hear me?

01:16:17.306 --> 01:16:18.141
Fuck.

01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:36.793
- Who has come for you?

01:16:36.793 --> 01:16:39.028
Who has come for you, tell me?!

01:16:48.337 --> 01:16:49.238
- Fuck.

01:16:49.238 --> 01:16:50.674
Fuck fuck.

01:16:50.674 --> 01:16:52.475
- What the fuck is
going on out there!

01:16:52.475 --> 01:16:54.077
- Fuck fuck!

01:17:04.721 --> 01:17:07.056
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:17:07.056 --> 01:17:09.458
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, please please.

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:11.627
Wait, wait, wait.

01:17:17.433 --> 01:17:19.769
- Tell me what the
fuck is going on.

01:17:19.769 --> 01:17:21.004
I know you know.

01:17:21.004 --> 01:17:24.573
I am fucking done
playing games here!

01:17:24.573 --> 01:17:26.710
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, no no!

01:17:34.383 --> 01:17:35.885
- God damn it Karla I know
you know what's going on,

01:17:35.885 --> 01:17:36.786
tell me right now!

01:22:38.487 --> 01:22:40.523
- Some people, when they hear

01:22:40.523 --> 01:22:43.259
a noise in the
middle of the night,

01:22:43.259 --> 01:22:46.629
are quick to assume
that it's a ghost.

01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:48.897
When in reality they
should be more concerned

01:22:48.897 --> 01:22:51.200
about somebody
being in the house

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:53.969
who wants to cause them harm.

01:22:53.969 --> 01:22:56.139
That's what we have here.

01:22:56.139 --> 01:22:58.074
People murdering
people just like every

01:22:58.074 --> 01:23:00.143
other case I've ever worked on.

01:23:00.143 --> 01:23:02.078
Now, I'll be the first to admit

01:23:02.078 --> 01:23:04.780
that those tapes raise
a lot of questions.

01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:07.216
And until we find Karla or the

01:23:07.216 --> 01:23:09.718
other people on those tapes,

01:23:09.718 --> 01:23:13.222
those questions will
not have answers.

01:23:13.222 --> 01:23:15.224
But I'm more than
certain that when

01:23:15.224 --> 01:23:17.326
we do find those answers,

01:23:19.162 --> 01:23:21.497
they will not be paranormal.

01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:03.672
- Lynn and I grew up
in a haunted house

01:24:03.672 --> 01:24:05.674
and with a single mother

01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:09.478
who had two jobs,
that was not easy

01:24:10.646 --> 01:24:11.880
for her dealing
with kids who were

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:13.349
scared of ghosts all the time.

01:24:13.349 --> 01:24:15.218
So we had to find some
other way to deal with it.

01:24:15.218 --> 01:24:19.388
Lynn could always see and
feel things that I couldn't so

01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:23.092
I did what I could.

01:24:23.092 --> 01:24:26.595
I researched, I delved into
any book about the paranormal

01:24:26.595 --> 01:24:28.597
trying to find some sort
of scientific explanation

01:24:28.597 --> 01:24:29.932
for what was happening.

01:24:29.932 --> 01:24:32.135
I became obsessed.

01:24:32.135 --> 01:24:33.902
Trying to prove that it

01:24:33.902 --> 01:24:36.139
wasn't just my imagination

01:24:36.139 --> 01:24:39.808
and I wasn't just
scared of nothing.

01:24:39.808 --> 01:24:42.077
I went to college,
I started S.I.G.N.S.

01:24:42.077 --> 01:24:45.381
and we've been working
on it ever since.

01:24:45.381 --> 01:24:47.783
- After high school I
went and joined the corp.

01:24:47.783 --> 01:24:49.852
I did two tours in Afghanistan.

01:24:49.852 --> 01:24:51.387
I didn't see any
really crazy combat

01:24:51.387 --> 01:24:55.791
but you know, it makes you
think about these things.

01:24:55.791 --> 01:24:59.128
You know, life after
death, ghosts, whatever.

01:24:59.128 --> 01:25:00.463
I came back and
after a little while

01:25:00.463 --> 01:25:02.331
I reconnected with
Lucas and I think he

01:25:02.331 --> 01:25:04.433
could tell that I was
kind of floundering.

01:25:04.433 --> 01:25:06.302
And needed something to do.

01:25:06.302 --> 01:25:08.171
So he offered me to tag along.

01:25:08.171 --> 01:25:10.473
And I fucking loved it.

01:25:10.473 --> 01:25:11.940
It turned into a
permanent position.

01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:13.409
That's a great way for
me to get my kicks,

01:25:13.409 --> 01:25:17.346
get the bills paid, maybe
answer some questions.

01:25:17.346 --> 01:25:18.414
- I used to have
an imaginary friend

01:25:18.414 --> 01:25:19.815
when I was a kid.

01:25:19.815 --> 01:25:21.650
Or at least that's what
my parents called him.

01:25:21.650 --> 01:25:22.885
He was this little boy who would

01:25:22.885 --> 01:25:24.052
come visit me in my room.

01:25:24.052 --> 01:25:26.088
And then my parents,
as I grew up,

01:25:26.088 --> 01:25:28.023
convinced me that
he wasn't real.

01:25:28.023 --> 01:25:29.758
And I eventually
stopped seeing him.

01:25:29.758 --> 01:25:31.394
So I guess I got
involved with paranormal

01:25:31.394 --> 01:25:34.530
investigations as a way to
reconnect with my childhood

01:25:34.530 --> 01:25:36.131
and to prove to myself
that he was real

01:25:36.131 --> 01:25:40.503
and not a result of an
overactive imagination.

01:25:40.503 --> 01:25:44.240
And it also reminds me of
a better time in my life.

01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:45.608
- I'm not like the others.

01:25:45.608 --> 01:25:47.310
I didn't grow up
in a haunted house.

01:25:47.310 --> 01:25:49.845
I didn't see ghosts
when I was a kid.

01:25:49.845 --> 01:25:52.481
In fact, I've seen very little

01:25:52.481 --> 01:25:55.451
in my life that I would actually

01:25:55.451 --> 01:25:56.785
call paranormal.

01:25:57.986 --> 01:25:59.488
My brother William

01:26:00.956 --> 01:26:03.926
claimed that he was
possessed by a demon

01:26:03.926 --> 01:26:07.062
that was trying to
control his mind.

01:26:07.062 --> 01:26:10.032
And he was also a diagnosed

01:26:10.032 --> 01:26:11.800
severe schizophrenic.

01:26:14.670 --> 01:26:17.973
Then he killed himself
when he was 23.

01:26:17.973 --> 01:26:18.807
So I began

01:26:21.143 --> 01:26:24.213
investigating the paranormal.

01:26:24.213 --> 01:26:26.449
Because if there
was even a 1% chance

01:26:26.449 --> 01:26:28.384
that my brother was
telling the truth,

01:26:28.384 --> 01:26:31.820
then I owed it to him
to find that truth.

01:26:33.389 --> 01:26:36.625
But until I am presented
with absolute proof,

01:26:36.625 --> 01:26:38.026
I remain skeptic.

01:26:39.262 --> 01:26:41.364
- As a kid I didn't
really understand

01:26:41.364 --> 01:26:43.432
what was happening to me.

01:26:45.401 --> 01:26:47.336
And it didn't help that

01:26:49.037 --> 01:26:51.139
my mom didn't believe me.

01:26:52.541 --> 01:26:56.712
And then Lucas had the idea
to start this group and

01:26:59.214 --> 01:27:02.651
that was the first
time really that I felt

01:27:03.786 --> 01:27:07.356
valued for what I
had always thought of

01:27:07.356 --> 01:27:10.359
as something that
made me different.

01:27:11.494 --> 01:27:12.961
For the first time I
wasn't really alienated

01:27:12.961 --> 01:27:15.197
from a group, I was
a part of a group.

01:27:15.197 --> 01:27:16.699
And that was nice.
