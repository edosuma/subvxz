01:10.152 --> 01:12.152
John?

01:16.325 --> 01:18.291
You know, you didn't
have to do this alone.

01:18.327 --> 01:19.993
A lot of us
would have liked

01:19.995 --> 01:22.495
to have had a chance
to say goodbye.

01:27.135 --> 01:30.003
Look,
I know that you blame me.

01:32.174 --> 01:37.010
This war's taken so many people
that we love.

01:37.012 --> 01:39.346
All we can do is keep fighting
and win this war

01:39.348 --> 01:42.349
and honor their memory
and their sacrifice.

01:46.521 --> 01:49.856
And we need you.

01:49.858 --> 01:52.859
You know,
we're so close.

01:56.865 --> 02:00.200
We need you.
That's all I came to say.

02:04.172 --> 02:07.340
If you want to share your grief,
we're here.

02:31.066 --> 02:32.899
You're wrong, Anne.
I'm fine.

02:32.951 --> 02:35.068
I want to be put back
on active duty.

02:35.120 --> 02:37.954
Anthony, I don't make
these calls lightly, okay?

02:37.990 --> 02:39.823
You're suffering from
post-traumatic stress disorder.

02:39.875 --> 02:41.992
I'm not!
I would know!

02:42.044 --> 02:43.877
That's the thing
about PTSD

02:43.912 --> 02:45.412
is that sometimes
you don't know, okay?

02:45.414 --> 02:47.163
You've been through
a lot recently.

02:47.215 --> 02:49.249
You need to --
What do I have to do to prove it to you?

02:49.301 --> 02:51.134
Stand down, soldier.

02:51.169 --> 02:53.253
Colonel,
you need me in this fight.

02:53.305 --> 02:55.588
You need every
able-bodied soldier here.

02:55.590 --> 02:57.223
No, you're not ready.

02:57.259 --> 02:58.925
We can't risk you having
another lapse in judgment.

02:58.927 --> 03:01.594
This is stupid, all right?!
We're fighting a war!

03:01.596 --> 03:04.597
And you keep your best soldier
out of the fight?!

03:04.599 --> 03:08.985
With all due respect, Colonel,
is this how you run an outfit?

03:11.490 --> 03:13.440
Looks like you're having
about as much luck

03:13.492 --> 03:15.158
with Anthony
as I had with Pope.

03:15.193 --> 03:17.160
He's still
blaming you, isn't he?

03:17.195 --> 03:19.863
Well, he's right to.
It was my decision.

03:19.915 --> 03:22.866
You did what you had to do
under the circumstances.

03:22.918 --> 03:25.869
I said he was right to blame me.
I didn't say I was wrong.

03:25.921 --> 03:28.288
You want to say goodbye?

03:35.630 --> 03:37.464
Say goodbye to that.

03:37.466 --> 03:40.383
That's all she meant to you.

03:40.435 --> 03:42.302
That's all she meant
to any of you.

03:42.354 --> 03:46.389
Sacrifice the ones you love.
Nobody asked me.

03:50.529 --> 03:51.978
That's a Volm ship.

03:55.317 --> 03:58.318
Hey, Cochise,
did you know the Volm

03:58.320 --> 04:01.654
were planning
on returning today?

04:01.656 --> 04:03.073
No, Tom Mason.

04:03.125 --> 04:05.125
It is I who summoned
the greater Volm.

04:05.160 --> 04:08.628
I need to see my father
to say goodbye.

04:08.663 --> 04:11.164
Where's he going now?

04:11.166 --> 04:13.166
He is not
going anywhere.

04:13.218 --> 04:14.667
I am dying.

04:14.669 --> 04:16.503
- What?
- What? Dying?

04:16.505 --> 04:18.004
What are you talking about?
What do you mean you're dying?

04:18.055 --> 04:19.889
My life-span has reached
its conclusion.

04:19.925 --> 04:22.892
We know what the word means.
I-I don't understand.

04:22.928 --> 04:26.563
I sought out my father
for the exchange of silence.

04:26.598 --> 04:29.015
Exchange of silence?

04:29.017 --> 04:31.017
We sit together
and experience

04:31.019 --> 04:33.186
each other's presence
for a final time.

04:33.188 --> 04:35.355
Cochise, talk to me.
What are you talking about?

04:35.357 --> 04:37.023
How are you dying?
How is that possible?

04:37.025 --> 04:39.109
How can -- how can we help you?
Yeah.

04:39.161 --> 04:40.610
You cannot.

04:40.662 --> 04:42.996
We Volm
have two vital organs

04:43.031 --> 04:44.664
that are similar
to your kidneys.

04:44.699 --> 04:46.699
I was born
with only one.

04:46.701 --> 04:48.034
That one is now failing,

04:48.086 --> 04:50.537
and so my life-span
is concluded.

04:50.539 --> 04:53.957
So you're --
you're just giving up?

04:54.009 --> 04:56.259
What other course of action
would you suggest?

04:56.294 --> 04:58.261
How about fighting?

04:58.296 --> 04:59.963
Haven't we seen
enough people die?

05:00.015 --> 05:02.298
Haven't we lost enough people
that we love?

05:02.350 --> 05:04.350
If there's a chance
of you surviving this --

05:04.386 --> 05:06.386
If these organs
are like kidneys,

05:06.438 --> 05:08.271
can't you just transplant
a healthy one from a donor?

05:08.306 --> 05:09.606
Hey, your father --
he could be a match.

05:09.641 --> 05:11.307
I could go see him.
He's here.

05:11.359 --> 05:14.060
Cochise, you in pain right now?

05:14.112 --> 05:16.229
How can we help you?

05:16.281 --> 05:18.982
No, I found Anne Mason's
suggestion to be humorous.

05:20.452 --> 05:23.570
That was laughter?
Yes.

05:23.572 --> 05:25.488
A transplant could be
a long shot,

05:25.540 --> 05:27.240
but we have to
try something.

05:27.292 --> 05:29.576
My father, Waschak Cha'ab,

05:29.628 --> 05:32.128
is a soldier
in the midst of war.

05:32.164 --> 05:34.004
He cannot be distracted
by something like this.

05:34.049 --> 05:36.299
- "Something like this"?
- Oh, I get it.

05:36.334 --> 05:39.969
A soldier doesn't blink
until the battle is won.

05:40.005 --> 05:42.639
Now I must go.

05:42.674 --> 05:46.092
My energy is fading,
and my father awaits.

05:46.144 --> 05:49.762
Well, I'm not blinking
until this battle is won.

05:49.764 --> 05:51.147
"Life-span concluded" --

05:51.183 --> 05:52.482
I mean, I'm sorry.
That's insane.

05:52.517 --> 05:53.983
Maybe I can talk
to your father.

05:54.019 --> 05:55.351
Maybe I can explain
to him --

05:55.403 --> 05:57.103
Or I can go and give him
a medical perspective.

05:57.105 --> 05:59.189
I'll bring Ben.

05:59.241 --> 06:00.523
I am sorry.

06:00.575 --> 06:02.742
I did not expect this
to trouble you so.

06:02.777 --> 06:04.744
Of course it's gonna trouble us,
Cochise. You're our friend.

06:04.779 --> 06:06.506
In fact, we're gonna do
everything we can to help you.

06:06.529 --> 06:07.198
Yeah.

06:07.199 --> 06:11.084
Thank you, my friends.

06:14.372 --> 06:16.122
A gift, Tom Mason.

06:16.124 --> 06:17.540
I will not be with you,

06:17.592 --> 06:20.093
but shak-chic il she-sheshash
will know how to use it.

06:20.128 --> 06:22.462
Shaq?
Mm.

06:26.301 --> 06:28.551
We've got to help him.

06:28.603 --> 06:32.305
I'm not working
with Shaq.

06:34.142 --> 06:36.609
Okay, that's cool.

06:38.480 --> 06:41.314
If I may?

06:41.366 --> 06:43.066
As you can see,

06:43.118 --> 06:45.401
the suspected Espheni activity
near Washington, D.C.,

06:45.453 --> 06:46.736
continues to jam our Intel.

06:46.788 --> 06:48.821
It has increased
by a powerful margin.

06:48.823 --> 06:51.324
They appear to be hiding
several major operations.

06:51.376 --> 06:53.493
Several operations?
Where else are they jamming?

06:53.545 --> 06:58.798
Mostly capital cities --
Moscow, Tokyo.

06:58.833 --> 07:02.051
The largest appears
to be above your Washington.

07:02.087 --> 07:06.055
And one very remote location --
Tiwanaku.

07:06.091 --> 07:08.258
Bolivia.
Dad. Dad.

07:08.310 --> 07:12.262
Hang on one second. That's near
the, uh -- the Nazca lines.

07:12.314 --> 07:15.348
What the hell are those?
Geoglyphs.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.817
There's an ancient myth that aliens landed
there centuries ago.

07:17.852 --> 07:19.602
Perhaps not a myth.

07:19.654 --> 07:21.821
Hmm.
What about Fayetteville?

07:21.856 --> 07:24.357
Are they still jamming Fayetteville?
Worse than before.

07:24.359 --> 07:25.742
How soon
can you get there?

07:25.777 --> 07:27.443
As soon as we can get more
vehicles and fuel.

07:27.495 --> 07:28.861
Oh, see, that's what I came
to tell you.

07:28.863 --> 07:31.197
See, it looks like there's
a police storage facility

07:31.249 --> 07:33.199
about 20 klicks away.

07:33.251 --> 07:35.201
Shaq, turn that thing off
before it gives us cancer.

07:35.253 --> 07:37.704
Think there's fuel there?

07:37.756 --> 07:40.123
Uh, yeah, I mean,
it's way off the grid.

07:40.175 --> 07:41.874
There's a chance
there's gasoline, transpo.

07:41.876 --> 07:44.177
We should check this out A.S.A.P.
yeah, man. Good, Matt.

07:44.212 --> 07:45.545
The Espheni are on their heels

07:45.547 --> 07:47.347
thanks to the worldwide
Mason militias.

07:47.382 --> 07:50.550
But whatever they are hiding
in Fayetteville

07:50.552 --> 07:53.219
and your capital
may reverse all those advances.

07:53.221 --> 07:54.687
All the more reason
to get on the road quickly.

07:54.723 --> 07:56.139
Well,
if we're gonna march

07:56.191 --> 07:57.523
into the middle of something
that nasty,

07:57.559 --> 07:58.858
think we ought to have
a lot more humans, guns,

07:58.893 --> 08:00.393
weapons, ammunition --
all that stuff.

08:00.395 --> 08:01.728
Abso-damn-lutely.

08:01.730 --> 08:03.229
Tom,
I been talking to you

08:03.281 --> 08:05.698
about this expeditionary
naval base near Norfolk.

08:05.734 --> 08:07.283
Supposed to
still be standing.

08:07.319 --> 08:09.202
Yeah, it's on the way to Washington.
Yep.

08:09.237 --> 08:11.788
Maybe you can get your portrait
painted crossing the Potomac.

08:11.823 --> 08:15.541
Is that all
you have to contribute?

08:15.577 --> 08:16.876
I'm starting a pool.

08:16.911 --> 08:18.745
I'd like to see
who might be next

08:18.747 --> 08:20.413
to be "sacrificed
for the greater good."

08:20.465 --> 08:22.548
With a bit of luck,
it might just be you, Mason.

08:22.584 --> 08:24.217
Do you
want to do this now?

08:26.838 --> 08:30.890
Tangle
with the Mason militia?

08:35.480 --> 08:38.147
Pope, listen.

08:38.183 --> 08:39.816
No, no, no, Anthony,
don't bother.

08:39.851 --> 08:42.184
I-I am not following
that son of a bitch anywhere.

08:42.236 --> 08:44.687
You're wasting --
Look, John!

08:44.739 --> 08:47.774
You're not the only one
that hates the Masons.

08:47.826 --> 08:51.411
All right, they take away
a soldier's weapon.

08:51.446 --> 08:53.780
Okay,
they take <i> me</i> out the fight.

08:58.203 --> 09:01.371
To hell with that.

09:04.676 --> 09:06.793
To hell with that.

09:10.509 --> 09:12.406
Well, we got enough gas
to make it to the facility,

09:12.407 --> 09:14.529
but we better find more or
we're gonna be walking to D.C.

09:14.530 --> 09:18.279
We could use another hand.
Ryan, want to go for a ride?

09:18.448 --> 09:20.247
You kidding?
I'm getting stir-crazy.

09:20.283 --> 09:21.749
Grab your weapon.
Load up.

09:21.784 --> 09:24.251
Let's hit the road.

09:24.287 --> 09:25.953
Really?

09:25.955 --> 09:27.288
I mean, yeah, why?

09:27.290 --> 09:30.841
No reason. Great.
Hop in.

09:33.045 --> 09:35.012
What if it had been
one of the Mason boys

09:35.047 --> 09:37.014
that got stuck in that
Espheni muck instead of Sara?

09:37.049 --> 09:39.717
You think Tom
would sacrifice them?

09:39.769 --> 09:41.218
Swing by
and pick them up later?

09:41.270 --> 09:42.937
Hell no, he wouldn't.

09:42.972 --> 09:45.139
He would move heaven and earth
for those boys

09:45.191 --> 09:47.141
and to hell
with the greater good.

09:47.193 --> 09:48.859
And what about Denny?

09:48.895 --> 09:50.861
Mason's got -- what? --
A dozen guys

09:50.897 --> 09:52.279
do all the heavy lifting
for him,

09:52.315 --> 09:54.148
and he lets a kid
get in there

09:54.150 --> 09:56.117
and do the most dangerous
grunt work.

09:56.152 --> 09:58.736
Yeah, she was a kid.

09:58.788 --> 10:01.739
A kid, man.

10:01.791 --> 10:04.074
And she died for what?

10:04.127 --> 10:05.793
For nothing.

10:05.828 --> 10:07.461
Well, heads up,
gentlemen.

10:07.497 --> 10:10.998
The next sacrifice
just might be you.

11:01.801 --> 11:03.767
I shall speak
in English,

11:03.803 --> 11:07.021
since you choose their customs
over ours.

11:07.056 --> 11:08.889
I do not choose that.

11:08.891 --> 11:10.140
Do you not?

11:10.193 --> 11:13.477
Have you not adopted
their custom of love?

11:13.529 --> 11:15.312
Is it not some love
for these humans

11:15.364 --> 11:16.447
that is behind all this?

11:16.482 --> 11:18.115
It is not. I-I --

11:18.150 --> 11:21.819
We do not tamper
with the fated order of life.

11:21.871 --> 11:24.989
If that were true, we would
cease fighting all battles

11:25.041 --> 11:26.824
and simply allow ourselves
to become extinct.

11:26.876 --> 11:29.159
Chichauk,
you will not be corrupted

11:29.212 --> 11:31.245
by petty
human narcissism!

11:31.247 --> 11:35.583
Is it narcissism to want to live
in service to our cause?

11:35.585 --> 11:37.918
I believe it
to be the ultimate strength.

11:39.222 --> 11:41.055
To die is easy.

11:41.090 --> 11:43.924
But to continue to fight
through all impediments --

11:43.926 --> 11:46.927
that is
the honorable thing.

11:46.929 --> 11:48.429
It is the human will
to survive

11:48.431 --> 11:49.930
that has kept them fighting
all these years.

11:49.982 --> 11:52.816
And despite what you believe,
father...

11:54.353 --> 12:00.324
...it is possible to learn
from this race.

12:10.453 --> 12:14.588
And every last one of you
is being led to the slaughter.

12:14.624 --> 12:19.510
But some of us are gonna fight
for our survival.

12:19.545 --> 12:20.594
- Not for the Masons.
- Hey!

12:20.630 --> 12:23.130
What the hell
are you doing?

12:23.182 --> 12:24.298
I'm telling the truth.
Oh, yeah?

12:24.350 --> 12:26.350
What are you doing?

12:26.385 --> 12:29.436
Pope, I'm sorry he couldn't
make it to Sara in time.

12:29.472 --> 12:31.522
Don't you dare apologize
for him.

12:31.557 --> 12:33.307
Your father's
responsible.

12:33.359 --> 12:34.975
Did you somehow forget
that we're invaded

12:34.977 --> 12:36.610
by hostile aliens
that are trying to wipe us out?

12:36.646 --> 12:38.479
He's not responsible
for every death.

12:38.481 --> 12:40.531
He's certainly connected to
a whole hell of a lot of them.

12:40.566 --> 12:42.066
You remember Lourdes,
Hal?

12:42.118 --> 12:44.118
She was murdered
by Tom Mason's daughter.

12:44.153 --> 12:48.455
Tector wasted
executing a Tom Mason plot.

12:48.491 --> 12:50.491
Scotty --
boy's body was barely cold

12:50.543 --> 12:53.127
before your daddy decided
to use him as bait.

12:53.162 --> 12:59.383
Dai, Kadar, Lyle, Crazy Lee,
Jimmy, Sara!

12:59.418 --> 13:01.135
They're all gone.

13:01.170 --> 13:04.254
Seems that whenever
somebody dies around here,

13:04.307 --> 13:07.508
it's usually because of one
of Tom Mason's big plans.

13:07.510 --> 13:09.977
What are John Pope's big plans?
You gonna hoard some supplies?

13:10.012 --> 13:11.478
You gonna piss
on every idea?

13:11.514 --> 13:14.181
Spread your toxic bile around?
Is that what the plan is?

13:14.183 --> 13:16.517
Smart.
You're right.

13:16.519 --> 13:20.020
We've been thinking
way too small.

13:20.072 --> 13:23.357
Got to start thinking
on a much grander scale.

13:23.409 --> 13:24.992
Remember...

13:25.027 --> 13:28.028
It was your idea.

13:53.139 --> 13:54.555
Gold mine.

13:54.607 --> 13:56.557
Looks like some of these
vehicles might actually run.

13:56.609 --> 13:59.526
Nicely done, Matt.

13:59.562 --> 14:01.362
All right, let's break into
some of these storage lockers --

14:01.397 --> 14:02.529
find something useful.

14:02.565 --> 14:06.483
I'll check out
the other side.

14:20.166 --> 14:22.132
Tom!
It's the jackpot.

14:22.168 --> 14:24.208
Oh, great.
These cans are filled with gasoline.

14:24.220 --> 14:25.586
All right, let's load them up
on the truck.

14:25.588 --> 14:27.421
Hey, Dad.

14:30.259 --> 14:32.476
There's no weapons,
but, uh, can we use these?

14:32.511 --> 14:34.178
Oh, definitely.

14:34.230 --> 14:36.063
Especially if the batteries
are still good.

14:36.098 --> 14:37.181
Okay.

14:37.233 --> 14:39.733
Uh, can we use mace?

14:41.270 --> 14:44.188
Mace? Good find, Matt.

14:44.240 --> 14:45.562
I think that would reach
an overlord's eye, don't you?

14:45.586 --> 14:46.491
Yeah.

14:46.492 --> 14:49.076
Yeah, let's put it all in the
truck. Keep bringing stuff out.

14:51.280 --> 14:54.114
Damn it.

14:54.166 --> 14:55.449
What's the matter?

14:55.501 --> 14:57.117
Did you get it running?

14:57.169 --> 14:58.619
It's a communications truck
with a short-wave setup,

14:58.671 --> 15:01.205
but I can't raise
anybody else on it.

15:01.257 --> 15:03.090
<i>Hallo?</i>

15:03.125 --> 15:06.093
<i>Kan iemand my hoor?</i>

15:06.128 --> 15:08.429
<i>Hallo?</i>

15:08.464 --> 15:12.132
<i>Kann Mich jemand hoeren?</i>

15:12.134 --> 15:13.801
<i>Bonjour?</i>

15:13.803 --> 15:16.136
<i>Es Que quelqu'un m'entend?</i>

15:17.807 --> 15:19.306
<i>Hujambo?</i>

15:19.358 --> 15:22.192
<i>Je,
mtu yeyote kusikia Mimi?</i>

15:22.228 --> 15:24.361
That's all the languages
I know.

15:24.396 --> 15:26.563
Only five?
Such a barbarian.

15:26.615 --> 15:28.148
Let's go see
if we can help Weaver.

15:28.200 --> 15:30.150
Hello? Are you there?

15:30.152 --> 15:32.453
Hello? Hello?
Are you there?

15:32.488 --> 15:34.154
Oh, my God.
Do you speak English?

15:34.156 --> 15:35.823
It's the queen.

15:35.825 --> 15:38.492
Do you speak English?
I forgot to try English.

15:38.544 --> 15:40.377
Yes, where are you?

15:40.412 --> 15:42.329
This is Professor Cecily

15:42.381 --> 15:44.665
at the SETI installation
in Inca, Peru.

15:44.717 --> 15:46.500
That's near
the Bolivian border.

15:46.502 --> 15:48.817
If they're at SETI, they must be
using a very powerful satellite.

15:48.841 --> 15:49.587
Can you hear me?

15:49.588 --> 15:51.088
What's happening there?

15:51.140 --> 15:53.090
I've been trying...
Anyone...With...

15:54.393 --> 15:56.343
...great deal
of...Alien activity...

15:56.395 --> 15:58.345
...Ly gone...Location?

15:58.397 --> 16:00.230
Did she say our location?
Yeah.

16:00.266 --> 16:02.733
Savannah, Georgia,
U.S. of A.

16:02.768 --> 16:05.319
Very good. Americans.

16:05.354 --> 16:08.489
I do hope you have a plan...
Americans always have a plan.

16:08.524 --> 16:10.190
I'm so...

16:10.192 --> 16:12.409
Is she gone?
See if you can get her back.

16:12.444 --> 16:14.745
Wh-o-o-o-oa!
Sweet Jesus!

16:14.780 --> 16:16.613
I better go see
what that is.

16:16.665 --> 16:18.115
See if you
can get her back.

16:18.167 --> 16:19.833
If you can, tell her
about the power core.

16:19.869 --> 16:21.451
And any militias
in the area

16:21.504 --> 16:23.464
should be focused on dismantling
any Espheni tech.

16:23.506 --> 16:24.671
Yeah?
All right, will do.

16:24.707 --> 16:27.207
Hello?

16:30.462 --> 16:33.130
She's pristine, Tom.

16:33.182 --> 16:35.516
She got a big-block
396 V8 engine,

16:35.551 --> 16:38.218
aluminum intake,
custom dual exhaust,

16:38.270 --> 16:42.723
rock crusher four-speed,
and a 12-bolt posi rear end.

16:42.775 --> 16:44.441
Not terribly practical,
though.

16:44.476 --> 16:48.195
No, they never were.

16:50.566 --> 16:53.567
She's completely useless
to us.

16:53.569 --> 16:56.203
But I've never wanted anything
so much in my life.

16:58.324 --> 16:59.623
Dan.

16:59.658 --> 17:01.875
I'm just gonna see
if she still runs.

17:01.911 --> 17:04.578
Don't take too long.

17:04.579 --> 17:06.579
No, no.

17:06.582 --> 17:09.583
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, baby.

17:09.585 --> 17:11.752
I don't really have
medical expertise.

17:11.753 --> 17:13.587
Why did you ask me
to come?

17:13.638 --> 17:16.138
Tom and Weaver were busy.
You were there.

17:16.175 --> 17:17.473
Thank you.

17:17.509 --> 17:20.344
Um, no, it's -- we just --
we haven't really had

17:20.396 --> 17:22.229
much of a chance
to talk about, um --

17:22.263 --> 17:24.231
talk about what?

17:24.266 --> 17:26.233
Lexi and everything.

17:26.268 --> 17:28.318
You think
this is about Lexi?

17:28.354 --> 17:30.437
Cochise is like family,
right?

17:30.489 --> 17:32.639
So maybe if we can help save
Cochise, it'll help us to --

17:32.663 --> 17:33.491
get over Lexi?

17:33.492 --> 17:36.410
No, not get --
Ben, I'm a doctor. Doctors fix things.

17:36.445 --> 17:38.278
If I can't fix things,
I get really pissed off.

17:38.280 --> 17:39.780
That's all.

17:39.832 --> 17:42.449
This has nothing to do with Lexi.
Okay.

17:42.451 --> 17:44.451
Waschak cha'ab: Anne Mason.
General. Good.

17:44.453 --> 17:46.286
Listen, we got off
on the wrong foot.

17:46.338 --> 17:48.288
We will proceed
with the operation.

17:48.290 --> 17:49.790
Really?
You will?

17:49.792 --> 17:51.959
It better serves
the Volm battle plan

17:51.961 --> 17:54.428
if my son were
to have a longer life-span.

17:54.463 --> 17:57.347
What a beautiful sentiment.
It's poetic.

17:57.383 --> 17:59.383
Let's begin immediately.
Yes, of course.

17:59.435 --> 18:01.602
Um, I would like to meet
your ship's doctor.

18:01.637 --> 18:03.437
I'd like to
observe the procedure.

18:03.472 --> 18:05.439
Observe it?
Well, you will perform it.

18:05.474 --> 18:07.608
Perform it?
No, no, no.

18:07.643 --> 18:09.476
I can't --
surely your ship's doctor

18:09.478 --> 18:11.311
is better equipped
than I am.

18:11.363 --> 18:13.313
I have
no "ship's doctor."

18:13.365 --> 18:16.650
An injured Volm goes
into stasis and heals himself,

18:16.702 --> 18:18.285
unless his life-span
is concluded.

18:18.320 --> 18:19.703
Chichauk will tell you
all you need to know.

18:19.738 --> 18:21.238
Okay, General,
I really don't think

18:21.290 --> 18:23.407
that I'm qualified to --
to --

18:23.459 --> 18:25.492
Thank you,
Doctor Anne Mason.

18:25.494 --> 18:27.828
Immediately, please.

18:29.665 --> 18:30.998
It's your idea.

18:34.970 --> 18:37.337
Hey, there's something
running in here.

18:37.389 --> 18:40.557
No, Ryan,
don't open that!

18:40.592 --> 18:41.842
Ryan!

18:43.595 --> 18:45.646
Ryan.
What the hell? No!

18:58.577 --> 19:02.696
Matt, run!
Drop the box! Run!

19:02.748 --> 19:04.614
Dingaan, get him in the truck!
Get in!

19:04.667 --> 19:07.784
Close the door!
Close the door!

19:07.836 --> 19:09.586
Hey!

19:09.621 --> 19:12.005
Hey! Over here!

19:12.041 --> 19:13.707
Hey! Over here!

19:13.759 --> 19:15.375
Over here!

19:34.914 --> 19:36.741
So, he can just
anesthetize himself?

19:36.742 --> 19:39.710
Yes.
He's put himself into stasis.

19:39.745 --> 19:41.828
So he'll begin to heal

19:41.830 --> 19:43.497
I-Immediately following
the procedure.

19:43.499 --> 19:47.334
The organ that regulates
my father's life force

19:47.386 --> 19:50.420
has been slowed in preparation
for the transplant.

19:50.472 --> 19:52.306
He can slow
his own heart?

19:52.341 --> 19:56.843
Yes, it will return
to its normal function...

19:56.895 --> 19:58.478
After...He has...Healed.

19:58.514 --> 19:59.763
Cochise?
Got you.

19:59.815 --> 20:00.897
Oh, Cochise,
are you all right?

20:03.519 --> 20:06.770
Anne Mason,
thank you for this.

20:06.822 --> 20:10.190
Save the thanks for later,
okay?

20:10.192 --> 20:13.193
This is
a six-petawatt laser.

20:13.195 --> 20:16.029
It will deliver 180 joules
of energy with each pulse.

20:16.031 --> 20:19.166
You will need it to cut through
our exoskeletal sheath --

20:19.201 --> 20:21.034
our -- our skin.

20:21.086 --> 20:23.754
Wouldn't it be safer
if you made the incision?

20:23.789 --> 20:25.422
I'm afraid my eyesight
and coordination

20:25.457 --> 20:27.541
have begun to falter.

20:27.543 --> 20:30.544
But I shall assist.

20:30.546 --> 20:32.546
Press the button on top.

20:32.548 --> 20:33.880
Okay.

20:33.932 --> 20:36.049
Excellent. Good.

20:40.856 --> 20:44.274
Yes.
Another few inches.

20:49.064 --> 20:52.866
Good. Quite good.

20:52.901 --> 20:54.901
Complete.

20:54.903 --> 20:58.238
Now we are ready.
You may proceed.

20:58.240 --> 20:59.456
Okay.

21:05.047 --> 21:07.881
Oh, good.

21:07.916 --> 21:10.967
It is very healthy.

21:16.558 --> 21:19.309
The incision --
it's closed.

21:19.344 --> 21:21.845
His body has begun
to heal itself.

21:21.897 --> 21:25.348
The procedure, for his part,
h-has been a success.

21:25.401 --> 21:27.350
Good, good.
Wow.

21:27.403 --> 21:29.820
Cochise! Oh!
Cochise!

21:29.855 --> 21:31.188
Put him on the table.
Okay.

21:33.075 --> 21:36.410
Okay, slow. It's okay.
We're right here.

21:36.445 --> 21:38.361
Okay.

21:38.414 --> 21:39.613
After I am in stasis,

21:39.615 --> 21:41.915
simply reverse
the procedure on me.

21:41.950 --> 21:43.583
Okay.

21:43.619 --> 21:48.538
I have now calculated our
probability of success at 35%.

21:48.590 --> 21:52.092
No, I will make this work
100%.

21:52.127 --> 21:54.211
My father is correct.

21:54.263 --> 21:57.597
It appears I...have adopted
one of your customs.

21:57.633 --> 21:59.850
I...

21:59.885 --> 22:04.438
I do love you all.

22:06.108 --> 22:09.309
Cochise?

22:14.650 --> 22:16.149
You ready?

22:16.201 --> 22:19.536
Yes.

22:34.253 --> 22:38.255
Eyes --
they've got human eyes.

22:58.193 --> 23:00.193
I saw those things.

23:00.245 --> 23:01.912
Let's load up
everything we can

23:01.947 --> 23:04.581
and get the hell out of here, pronto.
Yeah.

23:04.616 --> 23:06.283
Dad!
It's okay. I'm okay.

23:06.335 --> 23:08.368
What about Ryan?

23:08.370 --> 23:11.087
They got him.
He's gone.

23:12.257 --> 23:13.540
Well, let's keep moving.

23:13.592 --> 23:15.675
Got to keep moving, Tom.
Yeah.

23:15.711 --> 23:17.177
Come on.

23:17.212 --> 23:20.680
Come on.
Dingaan, grab the comms truck.

23:22.017 --> 23:25.685
This wait is killing me.

23:25.721 --> 23:27.554
This is the only time
I'm at peace.

23:27.556 --> 23:29.556
My work is done.

23:29.608 --> 23:31.558
I just pray and hope

23:31.610 --> 23:34.144
I'm...
Sorry about before.

23:34.196 --> 23:36.646
I-I didn't mean to --
No, I'm -- I'm sorry.

23:36.698 --> 23:39.065
You were right.

23:39.067 --> 23:42.402
This is all about Lexi.

23:42.454 --> 23:44.287
Of course it is.

23:44.323 --> 23:48.158
I just realized that
in the back of my head,

23:48.210 --> 23:50.327
I've -- I've been thinking
that when this...

23:52.714 --> 23:54.664
...when this absurd war
is over...

23:54.716 --> 23:57.217
That what?

23:57.252 --> 23:59.502
...that everyone
would just be back.

23:59.555 --> 24:05.759
That everybody we lost
would just...be back.

24:05.761 --> 24:10.513
I think I know
what you mean.

24:13.569 --> 24:17.237
Just a big reunion.

24:17.272 --> 24:20.156
A victory party.

24:21.193 --> 24:23.326
That would be some party.

24:23.362 --> 24:24.744
Cochise.
Cochise.

24:24.780 --> 24:27.581
Hey, are you okay?

24:27.616 --> 24:29.449
Let's get him up.

24:29.451 --> 24:31.167
Oh.

24:31.203 --> 24:34.788
It would appear you have
achieved your 100%, Anne Mason.

24:34.790 --> 24:36.706
I feel quite better.
Good.

24:36.758 --> 24:39.509
Good,
when your father wakes up,

24:39.544 --> 24:41.044
I think he's gonna be glad
he went through with this.

24:41.096 --> 24:42.629
My father's not yet
out of stasis?

24:42.681 --> 24:44.214
Uh, no, he's still healing.
Isn't he?

24:46.051 --> 24:48.268
His heart seems
to have stopped.

24:49.438 --> 24:50.720
Anne?

24:50.772 --> 24:53.306
We don't have
a defibrillator.

24:53.308 --> 24:55.692
We need something that can
produce an electrical charge.

24:55.727 --> 24:57.777
They're back.

24:57.813 --> 24:59.312
They have vehicles --
a car battery.

24:59.364 --> 25:01.648
Yes, stay here with him.
We'll be back.

25:01.700 --> 25:04.150
Oh, God.

25:04.152 --> 25:06.653
Baba?

25:12.707 --> 25:15.246
- Colonel, we need your car battery.
- What?

25:15.370 --> 25:15.946
We need the battery.

25:15.970 --> 25:17.690
Can somebody get me
some jumper cables?

25:17.691 --> 25:19.191
- What?
- Anne, what's wrong?

25:19.225 --> 25:20.775
Quickly.
I'll explain it to you later.

25:20.810 --> 25:22.052
Is everything all right?
Just pop the hood, please.

25:22.052 --> 25:22.811
Not yet.

25:22.835 --> 25:23.470
Is everything all right
with Cochise?

25:23.471 --> 25:24.607
What happened
with the transplant?

25:24.608 --> 25:26.357
Cochise is okay, but I can't
explain it right now.

25:26.392 --> 25:27.524
We need the battery.
Get me some wrenches over here!

25:27.560 --> 25:30.727
All hail
the conquering hero!

25:33.983 --> 25:36.200
You left here
with five, Tom.

25:36.235 --> 25:38.402
I'm only counting four.

25:38.404 --> 25:41.205
I wonder what happened
to young Ryan?

25:44.076 --> 25:45.796
What's the matter, Tom?
Cat got your tongue?

25:48.547 --> 25:50.130
Ryan was killed.

25:53.636 --> 25:56.420
It's a war, Pope. People die.
Oh, yeah.

25:56.472 --> 25:59.629
Yeah, they do when you're
at the wheel. That's for sure.

25:59.653 --> 26:01.015
Hey, Pope.
No, no, no. I got it.

26:01.016 --> 26:01.808
Why don't you just come over
here and talk to me?

26:01.843 --> 26:04.344
We got attacked
by those bugs.

26:04.346 --> 26:05.645
They got to Ryan
before I could help him.

26:05.681 --> 26:07.347
Same things
that killed Sara.

26:07.349 --> 26:10.183
You of all people might
have a little compassion.

26:10.235 --> 26:12.185
Compassion? Why?

26:12.187 --> 26:14.688
I mean, uh,
Ryan was just sacrificed

26:14.690 --> 26:16.273
for the greater good,
right?

26:16.325 --> 26:19.526
I'd say it was
a successful Tom Mason mission.

26:19.528 --> 26:21.528
You got a bunch
of trucks,

26:21.530 --> 26:23.113
and it only cost you
one human life.

26:23.165 --> 26:26.249
Come on.
You honestly believe --

26:26.285 --> 26:28.168
All right. You know what?
Let's get loaded up, everybody.

26:28.203 --> 26:30.083
We leave first light
for Fayetteville tomorrow.

26:30.172 --> 26:32.122
Come on, guys. Let's go.
Yeah, we'll leave for Fayetteville

26:32.174 --> 26:33.506
first thing in the morning,
everybody.

26:33.542 --> 26:36.293
What brave member
of the 2nd Mass

26:36.345 --> 26:38.628
is gonna volunteer
for this one?

26:38.680 --> 26:41.631
How about you, Anne?
You'd make a good martyr.

26:41.683 --> 26:45.685
How about one of
the precious Mason boys, huh?

26:45.721 --> 26:48.138
I mean, when are they gonna do --
all right, that's it!

26:48.190 --> 26:49.889
Tom.

26:49.891 --> 26:51.474
This isn't
your grief talking.

26:51.526 --> 26:52.892
This is just more
of your pent-up bullshit.

26:52.894 --> 26:55.729
What do you want?
You want to lead?

26:55.781 --> 26:57.480
Always bitching and moaning
on the sidelines.

26:57.532 --> 26:59.316
You finally ready to step up
to the plate and lead?

26:59.368 --> 27:01.318
I'd get a lot less people
killed, yeah.

27:01.370 --> 27:02.652
People don't die
if people don't fight.

27:02.704 --> 27:04.287
I have fought...
Is that your plan?

27:04.323 --> 27:07.407
...just as hard, if not harder
than anybody here!

27:07.409 --> 27:09.576
The difference is
you're happy

27:09.628 --> 27:12.212
to let somebody else
do the dying!

27:12.247 --> 27:15.882
Three years of this war,

27:15.917 --> 27:20.337
and the Mason family
doesn't have a scratch on them.

27:20.389 --> 27:22.255
Is that a coincidence?
We don't count my daughter?

27:22.257 --> 27:24.424
Is that it?

27:25.510 --> 27:26.676
My family's
been at the front

27:26.728 --> 27:28.812
of every battle each
and every time.

27:28.847 --> 27:30.513
Always in harm's way -- you
think that's been easy for me?

27:30.565 --> 27:32.265
You gonna stand there,
you gonna tell me

27:32.267 --> 27:35.435
that if it had been Hal or Ben
or Matt in that Espheni crap,

27:35.437 --> 27:36.853
you'd have just
left him there?

27:36.905 --> 27:38.738
No, of course I would have
gone back for them.

27:38.774 --> 27:40.907
But I wouldn't have taken our
only transportation to do it,

27:40.942 --> 27:43.193
and I wouldn't have stopped
the assault on the factory.

27:43.245 --> 27:44.611
I would have gone off
alone,

27:44.613 --> 27:46.746
and I would have figured it out,
so don't blame me --

27:46.782 --> 27:48.331
you're saying
it's my fault?!

27:48.367 --> 27:49.833
Is that it?!

27:49.868 --> 27:53.203
Yeah,
it's my fault Sara died.

27:53.255 --> 27:56.873
Yeah, the great Tom Mason
takes his daughter

27:56.925 --> 27:58.842
and flies her
to her own death.

27:58.877 --> 28:00.510
You know, Tom, you and,
uh, the misses there...

28:00.545 --> 28:02.512
Hey, dad.
Let that go, dad.

28:02.547 --> 28:04.964
...should try banging out a few more
half-breeds, you know?

28:04.966 --> 28:06.766
Hey, hey, t-Tom. Tom.
You don't want to lead.

28:06.802 --> 28:08.718
You just want to hurt me.
You want me dead, is that it?

28:08.770 --> 28:12.722
Tom.
Oh, you don't have the guts.

28:17.479 --> 28:20.947
If I am responsible
for all the death,

28:20.982 --> 28:22.482
if it's really me
that has led all these people

28:22.484 --> 28:25.652
to their graves,
then please, John Pope,

28:25.704 --> 28:28.204
in front of all these people...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:28.240 --> 28:29.739
...be my judge, jury,
and executioner.

28:29.791 --> 28:31.825
Look me in the eye
and take me out!

28:31.877 --> 28:33.460
Take it easy.

28:33.495 --> 28:35.495
Do it!

28:45.757 --> 28:48.308
No.

28:49.845 --> 28:51.678
That's not fair.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.680
Not like this.

28:53.682 --> 28:55.849
We have to go.
I know. I know.

29:03.358 --> 29:05.575
Not today.

29:05.610 --> 29:07.944
Who wants to go
with him?

29:09.614 --> 29:11.781
Anybody that thinks
it's a mistake to follow me

29:11.833 --> 29:14.033
can follow Mr. Pope,
but he is not going with us.

29:14.035 --> 29:17.504
That's right, Pope, you want to
be out of here, get out!

29:17.539 --> 29:18.872
Be gone by tomorrow.

29:20.292 --> 29:24.043
We are done.
You and I are finally done.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.714
No, Tom.

29:27.766 --> 29:31.050
This is just beginning.

29:31.052 --> 29:33.052
Clear!

29:33.054 --> 29:35.889
Still nothing.
Again.

29:37.609 --> 29:38.808
Anne Mason.

29:38.860 --> 29:40.360
Again.

29:41.730 --> 29:43.863
Anne.

29:43.899 --> 29:46.032
There's nothing more
that can be accomplished here.

29:47.402 --> 29:51.871
My father has...

29:51.907 --> 29:54.874
Reached the end
of his life-span.

29:54.910 --> 29:58.578
Mm-hmm.

30:12.901 --> 30:14.434
Cochise?

30:16.073 --> 30:17.453
Yes, Anne Mason?

30:17.454 --> 30:20.321
I wish
there was something...

30:27.196 --> 30:29.646
You never had
the exchange of silence

30:29.698 --> 30:33.534
with your father,
did you?

30:33.569 --> 30:35.285
No, I did not.

30:35.321 --> 30:37.454
That is a regret.

30:37.490 --> 30:41.158
Would it help if...

30:41.210 --> 30:46.330
I mean, would you like me
to share that with you?

30:54.223 --> 30:57.341
Yes, I think
that may be helpful.

32:35.741 --> 32:39.276
I'll be damned.

32:41.330 --> 32:44.531
There is...
An emptiness I can sense

32:44.533 --> 32:49.369
that infects
my every thought.

32:49.421 --> 32:52.506
Is this
what you call grief?

32:52.541 --> 32:56.209
Yes.

32:56.211 --> 32:59.546
It eases over time...

33:01.267 --> 33:04.134
...but it never
really goes away.

33:05.721 --> 33:11.391
It will become a part of how
you remember your father...

33:11.393 --> 33:13.860
But a sweet part.

33:13.896 --> 33:17.731
I feel...

33:17.733 --> 33:22.569
Strangely relieved of a burden
I did not know I carried.

33:22.621 --> 33:23.904
So do I, Cochise.

33:23.906 --> 33:25.238
Ah.

33:30.879 --> 33:32.796
Anne.
Anthony.

33:32.831 --> 33:35.332
Oh, you scared the hell out of me.
I'm sorry.

33:35.384 --> 33:38.552
Listen, can we talk
and clear the air?

33:38.587 --> 33:41.138
I'm so glad
to hear you say that.

33:41.173 --> 33:42.589
Can we find a place
a bit more dry?

33:42.641 --> 33:43.924
Yeah.

33:43.926 --> 33:46.593
So, you know,
it's not uncommon

33:46.645 --> 33:48.145
after going through
what you went through

33:48.180 --> 33:51.648
for a soldier
to lose his bearings.

33:51.684 --> 33:55.652
See, that's where
we disagree, Anne.

33:55.688 --> 33:58.822
I know
exactly who I am.

33:58.857 --> 34:01.358
This is where I am now.

34:01.410 --> 34:02.609
Where you are?
What...

34:02.661 --> 34:06.163
Please.

34:06.198 --> 34:08.532
Okay.

34:18.877 --> 34:21.545
Hello, Anne.

34:21.597 --> 34:23.714
You know...

34:23.766 --> 34:29.436
Sara was
always after me about...

34:29.471 --> 34:34.224
cutting my hair.

34:40.713 --> 34:44.882
I figured it's time
for a clean slate, you know?

34:44.884 --> 34:47.551
Especially since
your hubby there

34:47.603 --> 34:51.554
kicked me out
of his little "club."

34:51.607 --> 34:55.476
I thought it would be good
to start fresh, you know?

34:55.527 --> 34:57.694
He kicked you out?

34:57.730 --> 35:01.398
I mean, I kind of get it.
I mean, he's right.

35:01.400 --> 35:04.318
I hate this place.

35:04.370 --> 35:06.653
Guess I always have.

35:06.705 --> 35:10.207
I mean, I'm always bitching
and whining

35:10.242 --> 35:13.377
and complaining,
and I don't want to be that guy.

35:15.498 --> 35:19.466
I figure
if I hang around here,

35:19.502 --> 35:24.838
all I'll think about
is evening the score.

35:24.890 --> 35:27.591
So that's what
this is about.

35:31.297 --> 35:33.597
You blame Tom for Sara.

35:33.632 --> 35:36.150
You kill me...

35:36.185 --> 35:37.684
And now you're even.

35:39.772 --> 35:42.940
It's an
interesting idea.

35:42.942 --> 35:45.492
Have to
write that down.

35:45.528 --> 35:50.831
Pope...
Tom made a call.

35:50.866 --> 35:54.618
Maybe it was wrong.
Maybe it was a mistake.

35:54.620 --> 35:56.620
I don't know.

35:56.622 --> 35:58.539
But somebody has to
make the decisions.

35:58.591 --> 36:02.459
Do you think that's easy?
I don't want to do it.

36:02.461 --> 36:06.513
Day after day, year after year,
everybody looking to you.

36:06.549 --> 36:08.182
Everybody expecting you
to know

36:08.217 --> 36:09.683
what's best
for the greater good.

36:12.304 --> 36:14.188
No!

36:14.223 --> 36:19.977
What if one person
was your greater good?

36:22.865 --> 36:26.817
John...
I know your pain.

36:26.869 --> 36:28.485
You know I do.

36:30.289 --> 36:34.741
I live with it
every day.

36:34.793 --> 36:39.329
Do you really think killing me
is gonna hurt Tom?

36:39.331 --> 36:41.832
You know him
better than that.

36:41.834 --> 36:44.801
All he cares about
is getting our world back --

36:44.837 --> 36:47.004
for the future.

36:47.006 --> 36:49.339
Not for himself.
Not for me.

36:49.391 --> 36:50.841
For his sons.

36:50.843 --> 36:52.843
For his legacy.

36:54.847 --> 36:57.347
What is your legacy
gonna be?

37:00.736 --> 37:02.603
Is this what you want?

37:22.841 --> 37:24.708
Do you hear me, Tom?

37:24.760 --> 37:26.426
It's important.

37:26.462 --> 37:28.295
Do you hear me, Tom?

37:28.347 --> 37:31.848
There's no such thing
as a one-way relationship, Tom.

37:37.022 --> 37:38.972
What is this?
I don't remember this.

37:39.024 --> 37:40.724
This isn't a memory.

37:40.776 --> 37:44.645
We've learned enough about you
now to communicate directly.

37:46.815 --> 37:50.651
Rebecca.

37:50.703 --> 37:53.820
This is...

37:53.872 --> 37:55.572
This feels good.

37:59.745 --> 38:02.579
No, no, don't.
Stop. don't.

38:02.631 --> 38:05.082
I don't need an image of
my dead wife to communicate.

38:06.635 --> 38:08.468
Why can't I talk directly
to the Dorniya?

38:08.504 --> 38:10.754
We cannot exist in the same
state of matter together.

38:10.806 --> 38:12.389
We would die.

38:12.424 --> 38:14.841
The Volm said you're extinct.
How are you here?

38:16.812 --> 38:20.063
Are you the greater threat
that the Espheni alluded to?

38:20.099 --> 38:22.599
To them, yes,
we hope so.

38:22.651 --> 38:24.935
We're going to be
asking something of you, Tom.

38:24.987 --> 38:27.938
There is one final battle
yet to come.

38:27.990 --> 38:31.491
You must be ready.

38:31.527 --> 38:33.443
What's happening
in Washington, D.C.?

38:33.495 --> 38:34.578
Can you tell me that?

38:34.613 --> 38:36.113
It will
all become clear.

38:36.115 --> 38:37.531
What does that mean?
Tell me something.

38:37.583 --> 38:38.782
Tell -- you're not
telling me anything!

38:38.834 --> 38:40.784
Tom, wait. Where's Hal?
"Where's Hal?"

38:40.836 --> 38:42.669
What does that have to do
with anything?

38:42.705 --> 38:46.123
Tell me something important
or leave me alone.

38:46.125 --> 38:48.625
He was supposed to be home
from school by now.

38:50.129 --> 38:51.762
Where's Hal?

38:51.797 --> 38:55.632
Hal.

38:55.634 --> 38:56.967
Hal?!

38:57.019 --> 38:59.720
Hal?

39:13.485 --> 39:14.818
He didn't hurt you
at all?

39:14.820 --> 39:17.487
No,
but he was planning to.

39:17.539 --> 39:19.823
He's snapped.

39:19.875 --> 39:21.658
He's not the same man.

39:21.660 --> 39:23.827
He's dangerous.
And he's got Hal.

39:27.716 --> 39:31.418
If you're not back in 72 hours,
I'm coming after you.

39:39.928 --> 39:41.845
All right, Butterfield,
you drive the second vehicle.

39:41.897 --> 39:44.014
Let me know
when you're loaded up.

39:44.066 --> 39:47.734
Pope took the Bronco.
He's got a head start on you.

39:47.770 --> 39:51.438
You lead the 2nd Mass
to the naval yard.

39:51.490 --> 39:53.774
Don't say a word about Pope.
Or Hal.

39:53.826 --> 39:55.575
Just say that Hal
went scouting ahead with me.

39:55.611 --> 39:57.444
I wish you'd take
a couple of guys with you.

39:57.496 --> 39:58.945
There's no telling what you're
gonna find when you get there.

39:58.997 --> 40:00.497
He's already got his finger
on the trigger.

40:00.532 --> 40:02.115
If he gets spooked,
he's gonna pull it.

40:02.167 --> 40:04.501
I'm not letting anybody else get
killed 'cause of my problems.

40:04.536 --> 40:06.703
These are our problems.
No, it's my problem.

40:06.705 --> 40:07.871
It's between me and Pope.

40:07.923 --> 40:10.590
It's...personal.
You know that.

40:10.626 --> 40:12.926
And I'm not gonna Hal get pulled into --
Nobody's saying that.

40:12.961 --> 40:16.046
You got to do this,
all right.

40:16.048 --> 40:17.631
Just stay centered.

40:17.683 --> 40:20.133
And you get
our boy back.

40:20.185 --> 40:22.552
We'll meet you at the rendezvous point
in Fayetteville.

40:22.554 --> 40:24.888
I'll get Hal back,
I'll get out of there,

40:24.890 --> 40:26.723
and I'll deal with Pope.

40:26.775 --> 40:28.725
I'll do
whatever I have to do.

40:28.777 --> 40:31.445
War can be a drug.

40:31.480 --> 40:34.781
People forget who they are,
do things they'd never do.

40:34.817 --> 40:36.950
I know.
He's a dangerous man now.

40:36.985 --> 40:39.119
He's not the same man that he was --
no, I'm not talking about Pope.

40:39.154 --> 40:41.154
I'm talking about you.

40:47.880 --> 40:50.213
Be careful.

40:53.752 --> 40:54.918
Wakey, wakey.

41:06.265 --> 41:07.898
What?
You gonna kill me?

41:07.933 --> 41:10.267
Do it.

41:10.269 --> 41:11.735
Go ahead.

41:11.770 --> 41:13.520
Nah.

41:13.572 --> 41:15.238
You'll get your chance.

41:17.826 --> 41:22.946
You'll get your chance to die
for the cause, young Mason.

41:22.998 --> 41:25.115
See, I could have killed
your daddy.

41:25.167 --> 41:27.117
I could have killed him
right there

41:27.169 --> 41:29.119
in front
of the entire 2nd Mass.

41:29.171 --> 41:32.122
But I didn't.
You want to know why?

41:32.174 --> 41:35.008
It's too easy.

41:35.043 --> 41:39.546
Then I thought...

41:39.598 --> 41:42.215
He'll come for you.

41:42.267 --> 41:45.519
And when he does...

41:45.554 --> 41:49.689
...I'm gonna kill you.

41:49.725 --> 41:52.058
And then
I'm gonna kill your dad.

41:53.228 --> 41:55.812
That's fair.
