WEBVTT

02:21.182 --> 02:24.185
My name is Juanita Lewiston.

02:25.061 --> 02:27.980
I work second shift here at Saint Pete's.

02:27.981 --> 02:32.568
Well, now they call it
Fairdell Medical Center. Whatever.

02:32.569 --> 02:35.737
Ain't like nobody talked to me
about a name change.

02:35.738 --> 02:39.449
I'm still the one cleaning up the messes
these bitches won't clean up theyself.

02:39.450 --> 02:40.869
Hey, girl.
Hi.

02:42.162 --> 02:47.250
Some of the patients are nice though.
Like Ms. Berman here. She's sweet.

02:48.209 --> 02:51.044
But it ain't like I love my job
or nothin'.

02:51.045 --> 02:54.673
It's just work. Five-, six-day weeks.

02:54.674 --> 02:58.510
2:30 in the afternoon,
12:30 at night.

02:58.511 --> 03:03.265
Hey, and it ain't like I'm-I'm sleepin'
and takin' long bubble baths

03:03.266 --> 03:05.184
in between time neither.

03:05.643 --> 03:07.353
'Cause I have a family.

03:08.104 --> 03:10.231
Hey, Ms. Berman.
Hey.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.612
This my grandbaby, Teisha.

03:16.487 --> 03:19.073
Teisha, how'd I get to be a grandmama?
Hmm?

03:19.490 --> 03:21.992
That is something you don't know,
isn't it?

03:21.993 --> 03:24.244
You do not know that.

03:24.245 --> 03:27.582
I'll tell you how. Let me introduce you
to my daughter, Bertie.

03:28.249 --> 03:31.543
My mama told me to wait to have kids,
and I did.

03:31.544 --> 03:33.379
But I should've kept on Waitin'.

03:34.255 --> 03:37.883
I did the best I could, but Bertie,
she dropped out of school,

03:37.884 --> 03:41.595
had this one at 19, and then moved in here
with me and Rashawn,

03:41.596 --> 03:44.223
her brother by another father.

03:44.224 --> 03:47.017
Rashawn just smart enough
to where he ain't got no job,

03:47.018 --> 03:49.311
but he always got a pocket full of money.

03:49.312 --> 03:53.607
He ain't nearly damn smart enough for
witness protection, know what I'm sayin'?

03:54.859 --> 03:57.110
I'm a fuckin' ghetto cliché.

03:57.111 --> 04:00.907
And you are my
little ghetto grandbaby doll, ain't you?

04:01.324 --> 04:04.660
Look, it's Swee'pea.

04:04.661 --> 04:05.661
Mom.

04:06.913 --> 04:07.956
Mom.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.416
Mom!
What?

04:11.417 --> 04:13.169
You smilin' at the TV again.

04:13.962 --> 04:16.171
Ain't nothin' wrong with smilin'.

04:16.172 --> 04:18.257
I like Popeye and Swee'pea.

04:19.175 --> 04:20.841
Ooh!

04:20.843 --> 04:23.428
Teisha, you shit your britches,
didn't you?

04:23.429 --> 04:25.430
Ma, I'm going out. Can you keep her?
Uh-uh.

04:25.431 --> 04:28.892
No. This is my only night off. Come on.
But I ain't been out in two days.

04:28.893 --> 04:31.436
You ain't goin' out tonight neither.
Come get your child.

04:31.437 --> 04:33.188
But I'm dressed.

04:33.189 --> 04:35.482
Where the hell Rashawn?
He not here.

04:35.483 --> 04:37.276
Look, she gonna go right to sleep, okay?

04:37.277 --> 04:39.736
Then you can have this place
all to yourself for once.

04:39.737 --> 04:41.406
All right? I love you. I got to go.

04:43.825 --> 04:46.702
Teisha, your mama's a ho.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.328
You know, right?

04:48.329 --> 04:50.247
<i>Juanita.</i>
Look.

04:50.248 --> 04:51.581
<i>Blair Underwood.</i>

04:51.582 --> 04:56.586
<i>Ever since I met you, it's like I'm...
like I'm breathing from a different place.</i>

04:58.756 --> 05:02.010
It's like a drum.
I just want to make you happy, baby.

05:03.219 --> 05:04.511
Can I do that?

05:17.775 --> 05:20.777
I've been working at this place
for nine years.

05:20.778 --> 05:24.239
My take-home is still $12.50 an hour.

05:24.240 --> 05:27.784
Folks be talkin' about,
“Least you got a job.”

05:27.785 --> 05:29.494
I understand that.

05:29.495 --> 05:33.206
But I ain't even got time to get nothin'
from Blair Underwood in my dreams.

05:33.207 --> 05:35.625
Vincent, Jacob, hey.
Hey, Juanita.

05:35.626 --> 05:38.379
So fuck me for not countin' my blessings.

05:43.301 --> 05:45.469
How's your other son?

05:48.056 --> 05:49.765
Um…

05:49.766 --> 05:51.059
R...

05:51.976 --> 05:53.727
Starts with an “R.”

05:53.728 --> 05:55.896
Randy.

05:55.897 --> 05:57.482
He fine, Ms. Berman.

05:59.192 --> 06:02.444
He in prison, but other than that,
he doing real good.

06:04.947 --> 06:07.574
Well, that's nice. That's nice.
Yeah.

06:07.575 --> 06:09.493
Oh, sorry, here. Yeah.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.870
Okay. So has he made any new friends?

06:11.871 --> 06:12.996
No.
No?

06:12.997 --> 06:16.583
But his triflin' brother Rashawn
probably be joinin' him soon.

06:16.584 --> 06:18.085
So there's that.

06:19.587 --> 06:21.963
Well, that's great for both of 'em.

06:21.964 --> 06:24.050
Yeah, they can move in together.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.970
Yeah, and pick out curtains.

06:30.264 --> 06:32.600
Oh! Oh!

07:05.007 --> 07:06.968
Ms. Berman used to be a dancer.

07:14.642 --> 07:16.769
She been to Europe a bunch of times.

07:27.029 --> 07:28.406
Nighty-night.

07:35.246 --> 07:37.747
<i>I get in a
workout on the yard every day</i>

07:37.748 --> 07:39.499
<i>with some brothers that's got my back.</i>

07:39.500 --> 07:43.879
<i>I don't get to play ball as much,
'cause that's when I get to the library.</i>

07:43.880 --> 07:46.548
That's good, baby.
That'll make the time go quicker.

07:47.967 --> 07:50.469
Ain't nothin'
making time go quick in here, Ma.

07:50.470 --> 07:53.847
I know that.
But you're using the time in a good way.

07:53.848 --> 07:56.266
Yeah.
Better than being a knucklehead, I guess.

07:56.267 --> 08:00.020
That's what I'm talkin' about.
You are a smart brother.

08:00.021 --> 08:03.107
I'm proud of you, Randy. I believe in you.

08:03.774 --> 08:04.984
Thanks, Ma.

08:05.902 --> 08:07.195
Listen.

08:07.528 --> 08:11.282
I was thinking that I might...
I might take a little trip.

08:12.158 --> 08:16.871
I need to go away, Randy.
There's somethin' I got to do.

08:18.122 --> 08:19.499
Where you gonna go?

08:20.041 --> 08:22.126
I don't know.

08:23.419 --> 08:24.962
But sometimes I feel like,

08:25.838 --> 08:29.342
if I don't get out of Columbus,
I'll lose my mind.

08:30.301 --> 08:31.969
Damn sure know that feeling.

08:33.596 --> 08:35.097
Do what you got to do.

08:36.057 --> 08:37.808
Okay. Oh...

08:38.643 --> 08:39.936
All right.

08:40.811 --> 08:43.522
I don't know when I'm gonna go,
but when I do,

08:43.523 --> 08:45.274
I will let you know.

08:45.816 --> 08:48.401
All right.
<i>Time's up. Wrap it up. Let's go.</i>

08:48.402 --> 08:51.364
I got to hang up now.
There's a lot of brothers waiting.

08:52.323 --> 08:56.034
But you go on. And don't worry about me.

08:56.035 --> 08:58.329
Oh, okay.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.040
I love you, man.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.626
I love you too, Ma.

09:04.627 --> 09:06.170
I got to get back to work.

09:16.389 --> 09:17.974
Hey, how's...

10:01.976 --> 10:04.020
What? Where you goin'?

10:04.687 --> 10:06.896
I-I got some ideas.

10:06.897 --> 10:09.566
You don't even know?
I ain't decided.

10:09.567 --> 10:12.110
Ma, you trippin'.
That's just some bullshit.

10:12.111 --> 10:14.779
No, it ain't.
You need to get yourself a job.

10:14.780 --> 10:18.325
You need to look out for her
and this baby.

10:18.326 --> 10:20.994
Ma, you ain't goin' nowhere.
This ain't real.

10:20.995 --> 10:23.496
The fuck it ain't. Y'all grown!

10:23.497 --> 10:27.667
I ain't got to be up here Waitin' on you.
You got to do for yourselves.

10:27.668 --> 10:31.921
And I do not have to tell you
where I'm going or when I'm comin' back.

10:31.922 --> 10:35.676
Matter of fact,
I ain't got to do shit for y'all no more.

10:41.599 --> 10:43.643
Oh, man. Get your baby.

10:46.020 --> 10:47.772
Oh, shit.

10:49.523 --> 10:51.733
I still don't know where I'm going.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.778
But after that, I better start packin'.

10:58.115 --> 11:00.200
<i>Juanita.</i>

11:00.201 --> 11:01.702
Oh, my.

11:02.620 --> 11:05.622
So… Florida?

11:05.623 --> 11:06.957
Absolutely.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.377
But they got hurricanes down there,
Blair Underwood.

11:10.378 --> 11:13.506
And half them folks can't speak English.
Yes.

11:14.215 --> 11:18.094
But Miami is exciting and very fish.

11:19.720 --> 11:24.432
Yes, but Miami is exciting and very sexy.

11:24.433 --> 11:26.059
Is that what that mean, baby?

11:26.060 --> 11:28.521
Yes, I fell, my darling mama.

11:28.979 --> 11:32.357
Don't call me “mama,” Blair Underwood.
Oh, right.

11:32.358 --> 11:34.984
I ain't your mama.
Right. That's my bad. I'm sorry.

11:34.985 --> 11:38.279
What the fuck's the matter with you?
I don't know. I don't know.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.782
All right. Check it. Come on.

11:40.783 --> 11:44.452
What? What?
Come on. There it is.

11:44.453 --> 11:47.080
Ah! Don't hurt yourself.
Don't hurt yourself.

11:47.081 --> 11:51.167
So… So you really think
Florida's a good idea?

11:51.168 --> 11:54.004
That I do. And speaking of good ideas…

11:55.214 --> 11:57.174
Mm-hmm?
I'm thinkin' we might, um…

11:58.175 --> 12:00.802
might try something
a little different tonight.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.595
Oh.
What do you think about that?

12:02.596 --> 12:05.098
What do you have in mind, Blair Underwood?

12:05.099 --> 12:07.643
Well, I might, uh, do a little of this.

12:08.102 --> 12:10.937
Mm-hmm.

12:10.938 --> 12:13.440
Uh-oh.
And then I might move this here.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.860
Then I'm gonna work on this little bunion.

12:16.861 --> 12:18.863
Ha!

12:19.196 --> 12:22.074
I'm gonna work my way
right on down the line.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.868
But before I go any further…
Uh-huh?

12:24.869 --> 12:27.120
…There's something
I need to know from you.

12:27.121 --> 12:29.122
My safe word?
No.

12:29.123 --> 12:31.791
What I need to know is…
Mm-hmm?

12:31.792 --> 12:33.419
…Can you front me $50?

12:34.086 --> 12:37.755
What?
No, well, 60. Sixty would be perfect.

12:37.756 --> 12:41.092
No, I cannot front you $60,
Blair Underwood.

12:41.093 --> 12:43.219
It's not for me.

12:43.220 --> 12:45.555
No, it's for a project
I'm doing with Denzel.

12:45.556 --> 12:47.765
Parker, my-my neighbor.

12:47.766 --> 12:51.936
So we need some seed money for this
muffin truck idea that we're developing.

12:51.937 --> 12:54.606
Now, it's a food truck, but just muffins.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.983
Oh, no, no, no. I ain't hearin' this.

12:56.984 --> 12:59.777
Come on, baby. You know I'm good for it.
I don't know that.

12:59.778 --> 13:03.156
Yes, you do! Look, I'm here.
I'm taking care of you.

13:03.157 --> 13:06.784
Come on. All I ask is that you, you know,
you take care of me some, that's all.

13:06.785 --> 13:08.286
Take care of you?
Yeah.

13:08.287 --> 13:09.662
You too?

13:09.663 --> 13:13.374
I got three grown kids
by two deadbeat daddies, Blair Underwood.

13:13.375 --> 13:16.377
All right, I understand.
You want some time to think about it.

13:16.378 --> 13:18.505
I don't need to think about it.
It's cool.

13:18.506 --> 13:20.131
I'll be back.
When?

13:20.132 --> 13:22.718
When you get your mind right
about my proposal.

13:26.805 --> 13:28.182
You believe this shit?

13:29.183 --> 13:32.645
The only man I got
just tried to borrow money from me.

13:33.479 --> 13:34.980
And he ain't even real.

13:43.489 --> 13:47.159
I know one thing. I ain't goin' to Miami.

13:48.410 --> 13:51.120
Matter of fact, let me just see

13:51.121 --> 13:57.585
how far in the opposite direction
I can get

13:57.586 --> 13:59.838
from Miami damn Florida.

14:51.807 --> 14:53.517
Excuse me a minute, darlin'.

14:59.356 --> 15:02.026
Where you gonna go?
West.

15:03.319 --> 15:04.612
Towards…

15:06.363 --> 15:07.448
West.

15:08.198 --> 15:11.660
How you gonna get there?
On the bus.

15:12.745 --> 15:16.247
You just gonna get on a bus
and don't know where you goin'?

15:16.248 --> 15:19.793
I... I just haven't decided yet.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.378
Are you sick?

15:22.379 --> 15:25.590
Did you catch the cancer
from one of them patients of yours?

15:25.591 --> 15:27.634
What if you get one of your panic attacks?

15:27.635 --> 15:30.846
You can't... You can't catch cancer.

15:31.805 --> 15:35.516
Listen, my rent is paid up
to the end of next month.

15:35.517 --> 15:37.268
And Bertie is going to need a job, so...

15:37.269 --> 15:39.604
Bertie been needin' a damn job
for a while now.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.648
Instead of sittin' there
letting you wait on her…

15:41.649 --> 15:43.524
Now she gonna have to get one.

15:43.525 --> 15:47.613
So if you wanna help her and me,
now's your chance.

15:51.367 --> 15:52.951
Okay. All right.
Thank you.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.286
You're very welcome.

15:55.245 --> 15:59.083
I just came to tell you
that I'm gonna take this trip.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.126
And I'm gonna miss you,

16:01.961 --> 16:03.795
but not that much.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.798
Not at least for a while.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.424
You think you funny.
I am funny.

16:08.425 --> 16:09.885
No, you're not.

16:12.054 --> 16:15.349
For real though.
What's the matter with you, Juanita?

16:17.768 --> 16:21.062
Rashawn's half a thug.

16:21.063 --> 16:23.648
Bertie's trying to be a ho.

16:23.649 --> 16:27.276
And Randy's the one in prison. Randy.

16:27.277 --> 16:28.654
And I'm not…

16:29.655 --> 16:33.825
I'm not doin' any of 'em no good,
and I can't.

16:33.826 --> 16:34.952
I'm just…

16:35.786 --> 16:39.915
I'm just nervous and sad
most all the time.

16:40.958 --> 16:42.709
Oh, Kay-Rita,

16:42.710 --> 16:46.714
there's got to be something more
out there for me.

16:48.298 --> 16:49.883
So I'm just gonna go.

17:12.948 --> 17:14.199
I'll call you.

17:16.827 --> 17:18.162
Gonna miss you.

17:35.304 --> 17:38.681

19:17.322 --> 19:19.074
I'd like a ticket to “Butt.”

19:19.783 --> 19:22.952
I believe it's pronounced
“Butte,” Montana.

19:22.953 --> 19:26.915
Oh, okay. Uh, then one-way to Butte.

19:27.791 --> 19:31.336
Yes, ma'am. That'll be $197.

19:36.675 --> 19:40.095
Is it nice there? In Butte?

19:40.470 --> 19:44.098
I don't know. I don't think I've even sold
a ticket from here to Butte.

19:44.099 --> 19:46.351
I'm the first?
Mm-hmm.

19:47.644 --> 19:49.062
Do you have family there?

19:49.855 --> 19:51.023
Oh, no.

19:52.858 --> 19:57.029
If I had family there, you still wouldn't
have sold your first ticket to Butte.

19:57.946 --> 20:00.949
Thank you. Have a good day.

They let you smoke in here?

27:26.895 --> 27:30.147
Well, technically, no.
But we're in Montana.

27:30.148 --> 27:32.983
You know, folks here think
they should have the right to drink,

27:32.984 --> 27:36.029
smoke, drive, and shoot a gun
all at the same time.

27:36.654 --> 27:40.408
But God forbid my hand ends up in your

27:40.909 --> 27:42.994

27:44.204 --> 27:46.623
But I am gonna order a drink. Excuse me.

27:51.211 --> 27:54.047
I'd like a cold beer
and a shot of bourbon,

27:54.464 --> 27:57.091
and whatever Peaches is drinking.

27:57.092 --> 27:58.675
Mmm.

27:58.676 --> 28:04.306
Well, I got to drive this big,
hard, powerful truck

28:04.307 --> 28:07.268

28:08.144 --> 28:10.021
So I guess I'll have a Cherry Coke.

28:13.024 --> 28:15.276
Oh, shit.

28:15.860 --> 28:17.362
I got some stories.

28:19.114 --> 28:21.825
What was the charge?
Attempted murder.

28:22.659 --> 28:25.661
But you just said Randy didn't know
the gun was in the car.

28:25.662 --> 28:27.037
It don't matter.

28:27.038 --> 28:30.999
The prosecutor said Randy knew
the boy was in a gang.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.044
So once he got in the car,
it amount to the same thing.

28:34.045 --> 28:35.421
What?
Look.

28:35.422 --> 28:37.756
We talkin' about my neighborhood,
all right?

28:37.757 --> 28:41.802
Some of the kids
that my kids grew up with is in gangs.

28:41.803 --> 28:43.262
Most of 'em ain't.

28:43.263 --> 28:47.099
Some of 'em carry guns. Most of 'em don't.

28:47.100 --> 28:49.268
But as far as the police is concerned,

28:49.269 --> 28:52.646
they're all suspects 'cause they black
and they know each other.

28:52.647 --> 28:53.731
Hmm.

28:53.732 --> 28:56.608
They get the young ones
convicted of something,

28:56.609 --> 28:59.903
and then they don't have
to go sort niggas out at the precinct.

28:59.904 --> 29:04.950
You know, you get a rap sheet, you ain't
gettin' a job except for with the gang.

29:04.951 --> 29:10.038
The police is puttin' more kids
in the gangs than the goddamn gangsters.

29:10.039 --> 29:13.959
White people don't want to believe that
'cause it ain't happenin' where they live.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.169
I believe you.

29:15.170 --> 29:18.422
Oh, please, girl, do not get me started
about right and wrong.

29:18.423 --> 29:20.299
What, you ain't gotten started?

29:20.300 --> 29:23.136

29:24.929 --> 29:26.389
Feel free to tip.

29:29.434 --> 29:30.935
What, for this crap?

29:38.318 --> 29:41.987
Juanita, something tells me
Butte was not your final destination.

29:41.988 --> 29:46.158
No, but I hadn't planned
on going further tonight.

29:46.159 --> 29:49.870
I know a place that's a little friendlier.
Why don't you let me give you a ride?

29:49.871 --> 29:51.456
I'm right behind you.

29:53.625 --> 29:54.709

29:57.962 --> 29:59.254

30:36.626 --> 30:40.420
Well, if you wanna float off to sleep,
you can crawl back to my rack back there,

30:40.421 --> 30:42.006
catch a wink or two.

30:45.802 --> 30:48.637
Juanita, I got to ask you something.

30:48.638 --> 30:51.266
Why did you get on that bus
in the first place?

30:53.434 --> 30:57.522
'Cause if I'd have stayed, I'd end up
hating the people I'm supposed to love.

30:59.941 --> 31:03.068
And I damn sure wasn't going to Miami.

31:03.069 --> 31:04.988

Yeah.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.407
It's a long story.

31:09.033 --> 31:12.120

to be on my own for a while.

32:35.286 --> 32:36.871
He ain't even real.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.417

32:45.213 --> 32:46.589

32:47.382 --> 32:49.342

32:55.723 --> 32:59.894
Oh, Peaches, this is the dead-up sticks.

33:00.853 --> 33:03.146
This is the place I was telling you about.

33:03.147 --> 33:06.400
Don't let the outside fool you.
The cook knows what he's doing.

33:06.401 --> 33:09.152
Uh, don't stay at the motel.
The manager's a peeper.

33:09.153 --> 33:12.614
There's a boardinghouse up yonder.
Old gal named Millie owns it.

33:12.615 --> 33:16.703
That's where I stay when I come through.
Don't worry. She takes all kinds.

33:17.745 --> 33:20.580
Uh, here's my card.

33:20.581 --> 33:23.500

33:23.501 --> 33:26.212

33:34.554 --> 33:35.805

34:49.545 --> 34:50.543
Hi.
Hey.

34:50.545 --> 34:52.632

Oh, yes, please.

34:53.132 --> 34:55.176
Let me know if you need help with that.

34:57.470 --> 34:58.888
Wait...
It's French.

34:59.680 --> 35:01.015
Oh.

35:01.557 --> 35:07.354
Well, I just want fried eggs,
crispy bacon, hash browns, and some OJ.

35:07.355 --> 35:09.981
The special this morning
is croque monsieur

35:09.982 --> 35:12.150
with capers and smoked salmon.

35:12.151 --> 35:14.444
That don't sound like breakfast.

35:14.445 --> 35:15.946
Or eggs Benedict.

35:15.947 --> 35:20.075
It's two poached eggs, Canadian bacon
on English muffin with Hollandaise sauce.

35:20.076 --> 35:23.870
Okay. I don't do poached.
Can you just fry 'em up?

35:23.871 --> 35:26.415
We don't do substitutions.
Well, we could, but he…

35:27.959 --> 35:30.335
Can I talk to him?
Can I watch?

35:30.336 --> 35:31.337
Mom!

35:32.338 --> 35:34.257
Oh, Jess?
Yeah.

35:36.217 --> 35:39.094
Good morning. How can I help you?
Morning.

35:39.095 --> 35:43.640
Could I please have some fried eggs,
crispy bacon, and hash browns?

35:43.641 --> 35:47.645
Our menu doesn't include that.
I can offer you an eggs Benedict.

35:48.146 --> 35:51.940
Um, thanks, but I don't do poached.
They don't agree with me.

35:51.941 --> 35:55.443
Could you just flip 'em over,
fry 'em medium,

35:55.444 --> 35:58.238
butter the muffins, and hold the sauce?

36:00.241 --> 36:01.408
Here it comes.

36:01.409 --> 36:05.246
We do have the herb omelet
with andouille sausage and a croissant.

36:05.830 --> 36:08.415
A croissant sounds good.

36:08.416 --> 36:13.211
But what I really would like is
some regular whole wheat toast

36:13.212 --> 36:15.673
with my fried eggs and bacon.

36:16.549 --> 36:19.427
Ma'am…
Juanita Lewiston.

36:21.596 --> 36:24.598
Jess Gardiner. This is my place.

36:24.599 --> 36:27.310
Oh, it's really quiet.

36:28.519 --> 36:32.480
I don't do substitutions, so…
I ain't askin' you to substitute.

36:32.481 --> 36:36.318
Just rearrange the ingredients
so they come out like breakfast.

36:36.319 --> 36:39.279
I'll drink to that.
Dear God, sweet music.

36:39.280 --> 36:43.033
Mr. Gardiner,
I just rode seven hours in a big truck

36:43.034 --> 36:46.787
with a lady named Peaches
who speaks very highly of your cookin'.

36:47.205 --> 36:49.789
I'm so tired. And I'm hungry.

36:49.790 --> 36:54.336
And I would really appreciate
you fryin' me some eggs, please.

36:54.337 --> 36:57.631
Ma'am, this is my restaurant.
I'm not a short-order cook.

36:57.632 --> 37:00.175
See, that might be the problem
right there.

37:00.176 --> 37:05.222
I mean, no offense,
but something is wrong up in here.

37:05.223 --> 37:07.265
I mean, it's the only place for miles.

37:07.266 --> 37:10.353
It's cute as hell.
Y'all should have lines out the door.

37:11.312 --> 37:12.520
True that.

37:12.521 --> 37:17.275
I'm establishing a fine dining experience.
It takes time for that.

37:17.276 --> 37:19.986
Well, I don't know about fine dining.

37:19.987 --> 37:23.698
But it's 7:00 in the morning.
This here is a diner.

37:23.699 --> 37:25.867
That's what I'm talkin' about.
Lady's making a point.

37:25.868 --> 37:28.870
Yeah, you know what, Jess?
You make a really good cup of coffee.

37:28.871 --> 37:31.164
There ain't no ifs, ands,
and buts about that.

37:31.165 --> 37:34.626
And the crescents that you make,
those are pretty damn good too.

37:34.627 --> 37:36.920
But I think I speak for the little lady

37:36.921 --> 37:39.798
and pretty much everyone
around here when I say

37:39.799 --> 37:43.093
we do not want French cuisine breakfast.

37:43.094 --> 37:44.844
Period. Don't want it.

37:44.845 --> 37:48.598
And if I have to spend another winter
chewing on my wife's frozen waffles,

37:48.599 --> 37:51.935
I might as well go ahead and shoot myself
in the head and put myself out of misery.

37:51.936 --> 37:53.395
Geez, Drew. Come on.

37:53.396 --> 37:56.564
I don't want that on my conscience.
Well, then deal with it.

37:56.565 --> 37:58.984
So all of a sudden
nobody likes my cooking?

37:58.985 --> 38:01.696
Tell the truth, my friend.

38:06.659 --> 38:10.871
Well, Juanita. Since you started all this,
why don't I lend you an apron?

38:13.541 --> 38:14.709
Excuse me?

38:15.584 --> 38:18.336
Or are you here on vacation?

38:18.337 --> 38:19.755
Not really.

38:20.131 --> 38:24.385
But I don't know how long I'm staying.
Then stay as long as you like.

38:26.137 --> 38:30.308
I'll pay you on a trial basis
to cook breakfast for one week.

38:31.100 --> 38:32.893
Two weeks. Cash.

38:34.103 --> 38:35.354
All right.

38:35.688 --> 38:39.650
I'll have my niece Mignon
and her mother, Mary, show you the layout.

38:40.359 --> 38:41.360
Fine.

38:42.486 --> 38:43.486
Fine.

38:58.961 --> 39:00.463
What can I do to help?

39:02.757 --> 39:05.509
You could go ask those guys
how they like their eggs.

39:07.928 --> 39:11.264
Tell 'em after they've ate
to go spread the word.

39:11.265 --> 39:14.476
Black lady cookin' at the diner.
Okay.

39:14.477 --> 39:17.980
Bacon, butter, biscuits for everybody.

39:21.817 --> 39:23.569
Y'all got biscuits, don't you?

39:24.487 --> 39:27.239
We've got the ingredients.
Well, then.

39:28.616 --> 39:29.950
Go on.
Okay.

39:32.912 --> 39:33.912
Okay.

39:37.583 --> 39:39.460
I have stepped into some shit.

39:41.796 --> 39:45.216
I got to say, nice job in there, Juanita.
Mm-hmm.

39:48.844 --> 39:51.389
Want one?
I quit.

39:52.848 --> 39:54.141
So did I.

39:55.101 --> 39:57.186
You shouldn't stay at that motel.

39:58.062 --> 40:00.271
The guy there likes to peep.

40:00.272 --> 40:02.858
I'm aware.

40:03.401 --> 40:06.861
Millie's boardinghouse is a lot better.

40:06.862 --> 40:10.282
Just let her know you're working with me.
She'll give you a discount.

40:11.909 --> 40:15.663
This is the biggest littlest place
that I have ever been.

40:17.039 --> 40:22.503
Well, it's a shame
that you're scared of the outdoors.

40:24.171 --> 40:25.464
I'll be all right.

40:29.260 --> 40:30.344
Come on.

40:31.846 --> 40:33.805
I'll take you to Millie's.

40:33.806 --> 40:36.225
Oh, you don't have to.

40:37.101 --> 40:39.854
Just take it off. I'll take you.

40:42.106 --> 40:43.107
Thanks.

41:17.308 --> 41:20.978
Thanks for the tasty breakfast.
You're welcome.

41:21.812 --> 41:25.773
I wish I knew
how to poach an egg properly.

41:25.774 --> 41:27.902
Well I'd be happy
to be the first to show you.

41:32.156 --> 41:34.366
But I'm sure you need to freshen up.

41:37.077 --> 41:38.496
Asshole.

41:43.751 --> 41:46.961
I mix water and vinegar.
I don't care for vinegar.

41:46.962 --> 41:50.341
The vinegar you don't taste.
It's just to keep the egg together.

41:50.758 --> 41:54.260
Then I slowly turn it around.

41:54.261 --> 41:59.767
I like to plump up the egg
to make it look like…

42:00.768 --> 42:02.478
White girls' titties.

42:04.021 --> 42:05.105
Okay.

42:06.774 --> 42:08.651
Well, we'll cover it up.

42:09.652 --> 42:11.986
Then we grab the salade.

42:11.987 --> 42:14.365
Salad?
Yes.

42:15.032 --> 42:18.701
And then we reach for the… titties.

42:18.702 --> 42:20.537
Correct. Yes.

42:20.538 --> 42:22.831
Dip them in the ice-cold water,

42:23.624 --> 42:26.334
so it stops the cooking process.

42:26.335 --> 42:27.962
And then I take it out.

42:29.129 --> 42:30.464
Put it there.

42:31.632 --> 42:33.884
Take off the excess moisture.

42:35.261 --> 42:37.888
You add your garnish, voilà.

42:38.889 --> 42:41.725
Bon appétit.
Same to you.

42:42.434 --> 42:44.228
Hey.
Oh!

42:45.854 --> 42:47.940
Be right back with the cash, Mountain.

42:50.025 --> 42:51.944
Hey.
Hey.

42:52.987 --> 42:55.322
I'm the deputy sheriff around here.

42:56.031 --> 42:58.742
Deputy sheriff?
Mm-hmm. They call me Mountain.

42:59.535 --> 43:01.537
I'm Juanita.
Hi, Juanita.

43:03.581 --> 43:05.958
Here you go.
I'm off duty.

43:06.667 --> 43:08.002
See you.
See you later.

43:09.962 --> 43:11.337
None of my business.

43:11.338 --> 43:14.592
No, it's just that I've had problems
with credit and…

43:15.342 --> 43:17.886
It's a long story. Try the eggs.

43:23.684 --> 43:25.853
Okay. It's good.

44:28.374 --> 44:30.042
Jess won't be in today.

44:30.626 --> 44:32.752
Why not?
It's “E” day.

44:32.753 --> 44:36.215
It's the day my brother reminds everyone
he's just another drunk Indian.

44:37.925 --> 44:41.928
He's what you call a binge alcoholic.
He's getting a lot better.

44:41.929 --> 44:44.639
How do you figure?
He talks in whole sentences now.

44:44.640 --> 44:46.350
Not to me.
Well, yeah.

44:46.934 --> 44:48.768
Okay, what the fuck's “E” day?

44:48.769 --> 44:52.313
Desert Storm, on this day 23 years ago.

44:52.314 --> 44:53.649
He won't let it go.

44:54.483 --> 44:58.194
And what,
everybody in town knows what “E” day is?

44:58.195 --> 45:00.239
Well, it's a small town.
Pretty much.

45:01.573 --> 45:04.659
I thought he might've trashed the place
like he did last year, but…

45:04.660 --> 45:07.246
Well, even he knows
he can't afford to do that again.

45:11.875 --> 45:13.502
Where does Jess live?

45:49.329 --> 45:50.789
Oh, shit.

45:54.460 --> 45:55.461
Jess?

46:02.426 --> 46:03.427
Jess?

46:11.894 --> 46:15.898
<i>♪ But that wind never stops ♪</i>
Woo!

46:17.232 --> 46:21.862
<i>♪ Nashville was nothing
Like I'd ever seen ♪</i>

46:22.404 --> 46:23.404
Hey.

46:24.323 --> 46:25.365
Juanita.

46:26.158 --> 46:27.493
Jess, your hand.

46:30.579 --> 46:33.664
I wasn't expecting anyone.
Where's your first aid?

46:33.665 --> 46:36.418
<i>♪ Were you lookin' for me? ♪</i>

46:37.044 --> 46:39.212
<i>♪ Won't you please… ♪</i>

46:39.213 --> 46:40.756
Jesus, shut up.

46:50.224 --> 46:54.143
I'm not gonna be covering for you
every time you lose your mind

46:54.144 --> 46:57.855
'cause of some guy named Eddie
or whatever other shit you got goin' on.

46:57.856 --> 46:59.482
How do you know about Eddie?

46:59.483 --> 47:03.319
Apparently the whole town knows.
It's like it's a holiday around here.

47:03.320 --> 47:05.863
If I'd have known, I could've slept in.

47:05.864 --> 47:09.742
I didn't ask you to come see me.
I can take care of myself.

47:09.743 --> 47:11.870
Yeah, this is you taking care of yourself?

47:12.704 --> 47:15.122
You don't know about anything.

47:15.123 --> 47:18.794
Huh? I know enough to know
that you ain't right.

47:23.924 --> 47:26.718
Look here. I've seen bodies.

47:27.886 --> 47:32.599
Boys that I've known
since they were in Pampers.

47:36.395 --> 47:38.021
Was it your fault?

47:39.982 --> 47:42.401
Did you tell them, “It's clear.

47:43.569 --> 47:47.573
You can walk through.
I checked. There's no live ones”?

47:49.866 --> 47:51.577
Then ten feet later…

47:56.123 --> 47:58.584
his body parts were everywhere.

48:03.130 --> 48:07.050
Eddie had my back. I should've had his.

48:08.844 --> 48:12.055
Well, now you can't.
So you got to look after yourself.

48:13.557 --> 48:14.808
Yeah?

48:23.191 --> 48:24.359
My ride.

48:25.944 --> 48:27.571
I have to get back to work.

48:28.739 --> 48:32.034
Wait, how did you get here?

48:32.868 --> 48:34.202
I walked.

48:39.499 --> 48:42.251
I done told you already.
I don't know where she is.

48:42.252 --> 48:45.088
And I wouldn't tell you if I did.

48:45.797 --> 48:47.423
Hello?
<i>Kay-Rita.</i>

48:47.424 --> 48:49.717
<i>I'm gone five minutes
and you miss me already?</i>

48:49.718 --> 48:52.261
Hey, girl. What's up?

48:52.262 --> 48:54.180
<i>What's wrong? What happened?</i>

48:54.181 --> 48:55.723
Nothin'. Everything's fine.

48:55.724 --> 48:57.558
Bertie's fine. The baby's fine.
Is that her?

48:57.559 --> 48:59.644
Rashawn's still dumb as dirt.

48:59.645 --> 49:02.563
<i>What happened?</i>
Let me talk to her. Mama. Mama.

49:02.564 --> 49:04.107
<i>Hey.</i>
How you doin'?

49:04.691 --> 49:08.319
I'm fine, Rashawn. How are you?
<i>You know how it is.</i>

49:08.320 --> 49:11.280
I've been, like, thinking,
you know what I'm sayin'?

49:11.281 --> 49:13.240
How's that going for you?

49:13.241 --> 49:14.826
<i>What you thinking about, man?</i>

49:15.702 --> 49:18.579
For real. I'm lookin' to make a change,

49:18.580 --> 49:21.332
and like,
get out of the game for real, you know?

49:21.333 --> 49:23.584
Oh, really? That's good.

49:23.585 --> 49:25.461
<i>Yeah. No doubt. For real, right?</i>

49:25.462 --> 49:27.046
<i>But I'm gonna need,</i>

49:27.047 --> 49:29.840
you know, just like,
some dollars, you know,

49:29.841 --> 49:32.051
to help me make this transition
in my life.

49:32.052 --> 49:36.597
The transition from jail to bail.
And that transition ain't happenin'.

49:36.598 --> 49:40.142
I'm tryin' to talk to Mama.
You tryin' to go in her pocketbook.

49:40.143 --> 49:42.228
You believe this?
<i>She ain't got time for that.</i>

49:42.229 --> 49:43.979
Let me talk.
<i>Juanita.</i>

49:43.980 --> 49:47.483
He gettin' out the game
because he got a warrant and he's scared.

49:47.484 --> 49:50.444
No I ain't.
<i>Look, he is still my baby, Kay-Rita.</i>

49:50.445 --> 49:54.448
You said yourself your baby's half a thug.
Well, he got a choice now.

49:54.449 --> 49:58.035
He gonna be a whole thug
or he got to get out for real.

49:58.036 --> 50:00.288
You just got to
let this thing play out, girl.

50:01.790 --> 50:03.290
The police is here.

50:03.291 --> 50:05.961
Let me talk to him.
<i>Yeah, all right.</i>

50:13.719 --> 50:16.513
Mama?
<i>Rashawn, shut up and listen to me.</i>

50:17.305 --> 50:19.056
<i>I know you scared.</i>

50:19.057 --> 50:21.892
And when you get inside,
you're gonna be even more scared

50:21.893 --> 50:24.145
and you're not gonna be thinking right.

50:24.146 --> 50:27.231
And when that happens,
I want you to stop and think,

50:27.232 --> 50:28.858
“What would Randy do?”

50:28.859 --> 50:31.862
<i>And you do that. You hear me?</i>

50:32.362 --> 50:35.197
Your brother's gonna be fine,
and you are gonna be fine.

50:35.198 --> 50:38.325
You just…
You have to keep your mind right.

50:38.326 --> 50:40.078
<i>You understanding me, Rashawn?</i>

50:40.787 --> 50:43.331
Yeah. I hear you.
<i>Okay.</i>

50:43.957 --> 50:45.500
I love you.

50:46.585 --> 50:49.587
Love you too. I got to go.

51:22.996 --> 51:24.623
Garnish, garnish, garnish.

51:25.248 --> 51:28.960
Got it. Got it.
Orders are backing up here.

51:55.237 --> 51:56.904
Everybody ready?
Hell yeah.

51:56.905 --> 51:59.073
Juanita, ready?
Wait, wait.

51:59.074 --> 52:00.534
What powwow?

52:01.243 --> 52:04.746
I'll tell you on the way. Come on.
Hey. On the way to where?

52:05.580 --> 52:08.582
You know what? It's up in the middle
of the mountains, ain't it?

52:08.583 --> 52:11.502
I know 'cause I looked it up
on the Google.

52:11.503 --> 52:13.128
Google.
Right.

52:13.129 --> 52:16.048
Maybe you could tweet it to us
so we know how to get there.

52:16.049 --> 52:17.967
You know what?
Fuck all y'all.

52:17.968 --> 52:21.262
It's gonna be fun. We're gonna
be feeding a bunch of hungry Indians.

52:21.263 --> 52:24.348
And don't worry,
I got your wheelie bag of bricks.

52:24.349 --> 52:25.474
Shut up.

52:25.475 --> 52:27.726
You shut up.
You shut up.

52:29.437 --> 52:30.564
Go!

53:39.382 --> 53:40.717
Dusty.

53:41.468 --> 53:43.594
How are you, buddy?
I'm good.

53:43.595 --> 53:46.222
Right on. Pleasure. Where should we park?

53:46.765 --> 53:49.016
Uh, right on up there.

53:49.017 --> 53:52.145
All right. I'll see you in a bit.
See you in a little bit.

54:00.487 --> 54:02.072
Keep the wings coming.

54:36.606 --> 54:38.440
Jess! Jess!

54:38.441 --> 54:41.527
Yeah?
Jess. Come here.

54:41.528 --> 54:43.238
Yeah?
Give me your arm.

54:44.322 --> 54:46.865
Take me over there, please.
I need to sit inside.

54:46.866 --> 54:49.076
Okay. Well, just have a seat here and…

54:49.077 --> 54:52.455
No. I'm telling you, I need to go inside.
Okay.

54:52.956 --> 54:55.792
My heart's racing. I can't breathe.

54:56.501 --> 54:58.919
Jess, I can't... I can't breathe.

54:58.920 --> 55:01.380
Just listen to the drums.
Yeah. Yeah.

55:01.381 --> 55:03.341
Feel your heart beat.
Yes.

55:22.610 --> 55:23.987
Better?
Mm-hmm.

56:03.985 --> 56:08.031
We're gonna say a short prayer over you
and bless you and cleanse you up.

56:08.698 --> 56:12.660
And then we'll sing a song
for your spirit to heal you.

56:20.335 --> 56:22.211
We ask the Creator to help us…

56:23.713 --> 56:25.673
…To bless us and watch over you.

56:28.218 --> 56:31.137
We ask all the spirits of the earth
to come and help you.

56:36.851 --> 56:39.394
We ask the old people, our holy people,

56:39.395 --> 56:41.815
the ones that passed on,
to come and help you.

56:53.368 --> 56:57.913
So all your energy
that will go inside the smoke

56:57.914 --> 56:59.874
will go into the Creator's world,

57:00.542 --> 57:03.294
so that you think of all the things
that will help you,

57:03.920 --> 57:06.214
all your relatives that come and help you.

57:07.090 --> 57:08.882
As we sing this song for them,

57:08.883 --> 57:11.927
we call on their spirits
to come in and give you a hand.

57:11.928 --> 57:16.056
We cleanse your body
so you can travel in a good way.

57:16.057 --> 57:17.725
Your life will be good again.

57:18.685 --> 57:20.812
It's up to you to keep it that way.

57:22.272 --> 57:23.523
Thank you.

59:54.090 --> 59:55.383
Mornin'.
Mornin'.

01:00:01.639 --> 01:00:03.390
Seen Juanita?
No.

01:00:03.391 --> 01:00:05.685
Wishing she was sleeping with you
in your bed there?

01:00:07.186 --> 01:00:09.062
Thought she was bunking with you
last night.

01:00:09.063 --> 01:00:13.151
Well, she was. But she's not there now.
And I didn't know whether you and her had…

01:00:14.902 --> 01:00:16.696
It's not such a crazy idea, is it?

01:00:20.742 --> 01:00:22.118
She went that way.

01:00:24.078 --> 01:00:26.914
All right. Thanks for the coffee.

01:00:46.851 --> 01:00:48.852
So what's wrong?

01:00:48.853 --> 01:00:52.439
I wish I hadn't gone
this far from my kids.

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:54.442
I miss 'em so much.

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:58.946
But I wasn't doing any of 'em any good.

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:02.075
You got to do
what's right for you.

01:01:03.117 --> 01:01:05.244
Do you know what you've done for me?

01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:08.706
Look, you've helped
turn my business around.

01:01:10.249 --> 01:01:13.294
And you patched me up the other day.

01:01:16.631 --> 01:01:19.801
I... I appreciate you, Juanita.

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:29.768
Come on. I'll take you back.

01:01:29.769 --> 01:01:31.896
Don't want people to think you're crazy.

01:01:51.958 --> 01:01:55.336
What are you all smiling for?
The food that good?

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:00.425
I'm hungry.
You hungry?

01:02:14.772 --> 01:02:17.316
I love that hair color.
Thank you.

01:02:42.049 --> 01:02:44.969
Oh, man.
What's up with you?

01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:49.891
It's my shoulder. It's just out of place.

01:02:50.641 --> 01:02:52.894
It needs something to rest on.

01:02:56.189 --> 01:02:57.398
All right.

01:02:58.191 --> 01:03:00.859
You better not get us in a wreck.

01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:04.447
I'm the one out of my belt.
We can share my seat belt.

01:03:05.072 --> 01:03:07.116
Shut up.
No, you shut up.

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:10.202
Ooh!

01:03:10.203 --> 01:03:11.954
Hey.

01:03:14.290 --> 01:03:15.958
Carl!
Oh.

01:04:01.838 --> 01:04:02.964
All right.

01:04:04.423 --> 01:04:05.508
Oh, my.

01:04:20.815 --> 01:04:22.483
Oh, my God.

01:04:34.495 --> 01:04:35.495
Jess.

01:04:36.455 --> 01:04:38.582
Jess.

01:04:38.583 --> 01:04:39.958
Jess. Hey.

01:04:39.959 --> 01:04:42.294
Jess, hey! Shh!

01:04:42.295 --> 01:04:44.629
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:46.798
Okay? Hey.

01:04:46.799 --> 01:04:48.884
Shh.

01:04:48.885 --> 01:04:51.386
You all right?
Oh, Juanita…

01:04:51.387 --> 01:04:52.721
Yeah?

01:04:52.722 --> 01:04:56.601
Oh, goddamn.

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:01.605
This terrible dream…

01:05:01.606 --> 01:05:03.858
Yeah, yeah, I got that.

01:05:06.193 --> 01:05:08.904
God, I could use a drink.

01:05:08.905 --> 01:05:10.823
Okay. All right.

01:05:11.407 --> 01:05:14.659
You go ahead and get one,

01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:16.787
and I will be on my way.

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.581
What? No. I...

01:05:19.582 --> 01:05:23.793
I don't want one. It just helps to say it.

01:05:23.794 --> 01:05:25.962
Well, that's bullshit.

01:05:25.963 --> 01:05:28.757
See, that's puttin' it on me,

01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:31.886
so when you drink, then it's my fault.

01:05:32.803 --> 01:05:34.971
I know the territory.

01:05:34.972 --> 01:05:36.974
I ain't sticking around for it, Jess.

01:05:38.351 --> 01:05:39.810
I... Hey.

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:44.231
I wouldn't do that to you.

01:05:45.399 --> 01:05:46.943
You don't know that.

01:05:49.862 --> 01:05:52.406
That's true. I'm sorry.

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:56.577
Look, I do want a drink.
But I'm not gonna.

01:05:58.245 --> 01:05:59.997
I want you to trust me.

01:06:03.084 --> 01:06:04.794
I don't know if I can.

01:06:08.756 --> 01:06:10.091
Well, that's fair.

01:06:12.093 --> 01:06:13.970
Can I make you some breakfast?

01:06:17.473 --> 01:06:20.226
You know they put us together as a joke.

01:06:21.227 --> 01:06:23.854
The Blackfoot Montana Indian…

01:06:24.855 --> 01:06:27.024
and the black kid from Newark.

01:06:31.112 --> 01:06:32.738
Thank you.
Welcome.

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:35.615
Before we went to the Gulf,

01:06:35.616 --> 01:06:39.285
we already had plans
to work together after the army.

01:06:39.286 --> 01:06:41.163
I was gonna show him how to cook.

01:06:47.044 --> 01:06:49.255
I think that's why I like black people.

01:06:52.341 --> 01:06:55.553
I told Randy not to get in the car
with those knuckleheads.

01:06:56.595 --> 01:06:58.179
I been telling him that

01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:01.851
since before he was old enough
to cross the street by himself.

01:07:02.935 --> 01:07:05.146
And he'd always say,
“Yes, ma'am. I won't.”

01:07:05.646 --> 01:07:08.649
But he did. He made a mistake.

01:07:10.276 --> 01:07:11.569
So did Eddie.

01:07:12.695 --> 01:07:14.488
It's not our fault, Jess.

01:07:16.407 --> 01:07:19.118
Voilà, breakfast <i>américain</i>.

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:23.539
Bon appétit.
Thank you.

01:07:29.462 --> 01:07:30.755
I like you.

01:07:34.258 --> 01:07:35.718
I like you too.

01:07:36.552 --> 01:07:39.013
But…
But what?

01:07:42.266 --> 01:07:45.478
We ought to take this slow.
I don't know, Juanita.

01:07:46.312 --> 01:07:48.730
You know me. I enjoy the fast lane. I'm...

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:53.152
Jess, I ain't playin'.
I mean, I wanna keep moving.

01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:57.198
Then keep moving.

01:07:58.282 --> 01:08:00.325
I'll be here when you come back.

01:08:00.326 --> 01:08:02.787
Bullshit.
What?

01:08:03.996 --> 01:08:06.998
Do you mean that?
Yeah, I think so.

01:08:06.999 --> 01:08:09.877
You think so?
Well, yeah, I mean it.

01:08:11.003 --> 01:08:15.215
You don't believe me.
Why the fuck should I believe you?

01:08:15.216 --> 01:08:18.844
I mean, this is all nice,

01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:23.098
but drunk motherfucker in the kitchen,
he ain't so nice.

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:25.725
And what about you,
always stumbling everywhere?

01:08:26.685 --> 01:08:29.354
The black woman
who always has her guard up.

01:08:31.649 --> 01:08:35.486
No one's perfect.
But no one wants to be alone.

01:08:36.654 --> 01:08:37.947
I don't mind it.

01:08:38.656 --> 01:08:44.036
I took this trip to be on my own,
and this certainly is not my last stop.

01:08:45.496 --> 01:08:48.290
I'm going to California to see the ocean.

01:08:48.999 --> 01:08:50.709
And I want you to see it.

01:08:52.752 --> 01:08:56.090
But when you come back,
you better take that bug out of your ass.

01:08:57.675 --> 01:09:01.095
Maybe I will, and maybe I won't.

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:04.723
Man, I miss you already.

01:09:08.018 --> 01:09:10.769
Hey, welcome back.
Hey.

01:09:10.770 --> 01:09:13.106
Juanita, you look great.
Doesn't she?

01:09:13.107 --> 01:09:15.774
What'd you do, get a makeover?
Wow.

01:09:15.776 --> 01:09:16.819
No.

01:09:18.194 --> 01:09:20.904
I think our secret is out.

01:09:20.906 --> 01:09:22.158
Oh, God.

01:09:28.912 --> 01:09:33.544

I'm not ready for all this.

01:09:52.979 --> 01:09:54.356
Ready for what?

01:09:57.067 --> 01:09:58.152

Mama?

01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:37.733
Randy! What-What are you doing here?

01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:42.904
Did you escape?
No, I'm out on parole.

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:46.866
You know, they have so many brothers
locked up, somethin' had to give.

01:10:46.867 --> 01:10:50.036
And I've been doing good,
staying busy like we talked about.

01:10:50.037 --> 01:10:52.830
Oh!

01:10:52.831 --> 01:10:54.290
Oh...

01:10:54.291 --> 01:10:57.585
How did you get here?
On the bus, same as you.

01:10:57.586 --> 01:11:00.004
Mountain just dropped me off
from town, so…

01:11:00.005 --> 01:11:01.714
Morning, Miss Juanita.

01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:08.012
Oh, my God.

01:11:08.013 --> 01:11:11.474
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
Surprise.

01:11:11.475 --> 01:11:14.852
I'll be damned. Oh, my God.
Ma, Ma, Ma.

01:11:14.853 --> 01:11:17.022
What?
I'm hungry.

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:21.902
Oh, hell. Yeah, let's go. Oh! Oh!

01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:25.405
Hey, everybody. This is…
You got to be Randy.

01:11:25.406 --> 01:11:27.825
Hey, how you doing, Mr. Gardiner?
Call me Jess.

01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:30.618
How you doing, Jess?
Too late for breakfast.

01:11:30.619 --> 01:11:34.872
I can offer you coffee.
Shut up. I got you covered. I got you.

01:11:34.873 --> 01:11:37.459
Hey. Here. I got…

01:11:39.378 --> 01:11:42.338
I'll keep five. I'll have the rest to you
when I'm able, all right?

01:11:42.339 --> 01:11:45.133
That's all right. Long trip?
Long, yeah.

01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:46.968
All right. This is, uh...

01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:49.637
Drew. How was the bus ride?
Long.

01:11:49.638 --> 01:11:52.432
You had no right
to keep it a secret from me, Jess.

01:11:52.433 --> 01:11:55.436
It wasn't my decision.
Oh, bullshit.

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:58.104
He didn't want you to know.

01:11:58.105 --> 01:11:59.231
Why not?

01:12:00.274 --> 01:12:03.819
'Cause he knew you'd get anxious
waiting for him all weekend.

01:12:05.029 --> 01:12:08.406
No. He knew you was buyin' him a ticket.

01:12:08.407 --> 01:12:12.035
I loaned him that money.
He said he'd buy the ticket himself.

01:12:12.036 --> 01:12:15.830
And you wanted me to come out
and cook for y'all all weekend.

01:12:15.831 --> 01:12:18.082
What? Jesus.
Yeah, yeah.

01:12:18.083 --> 01:12:21.627
You want to be the man,
keepin' my black ass in your kitchen.

01:12:21.628 --> 01:12:23.880
What? Now you're making things up.

01:12:23.881 --> 01:12:26.215
Dragging me out in the middle of nowhere.

01:12:26.216 --> 01:12:27.675
Drag you?
Mmm.

01:12:27.676 --> 01:12:31.471
Juanita, there is no possible way
that I could ever make you do anything.

01:12:31.472 --> 01:12:35.141
Hey! I wish you'd go ahead
and just yell at each other

01:12:35.142 --> 01:12:36.559
so I can go back to sleep.

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:38.729
It's noisier than prison. Shit.

01:12:39.229 --> 01:12:41.315
All this whispering is what woke me up.

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:47.363
Oh, and, Ma,
I told him not to tell you I was coming.

01:12:49.907 --> 01:12:51.658
Good night.
Night.

01:13:00.334 --> 01:13:02.461
Now can we go to bed?

01:13:15.349 --> 01:13:16.974
Let's try this again.
Okay.

01:13:16.975 --> 01:13:19.894
The vinegar in the water
is to keep the egg together.

01:13:19.895 --> 01:13:23.356
Twirl it around like the whirlpool.
Okay.

01:13:23.357 --> 01:13:26.859
All right. Just like that. That's good.
Okay.

01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:30.071
Crack it, keep it close
'cause it's gonna suck it in the middle.

01:13:30.072 --> 01:13:31.656
There you go.
Okay.

01:13:31.657 --> 01:13:34.785
Voilà. So keep at it, and, uh…

01:13:35.911 --> 01:13:38.163
be better than your last five eggs.

01:13:39.081 --> 01:13:41.249
<i>Say hi to your big mama, Tee.</i>
Hey!

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:44.544
<i>Go on, now. Say hi. Well, at least wave.</i>
Tee!

01:13:44.545 --> 01:13:48.381
<i>I told Bertie I wasn't gonna hire her
if she was gonna be late or lazy.</i>

01:13:48.382 --> 01:13:50.091
<i>Tell your mama what you said, Bertie.</i>

01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:53.595
<i>I told her, I said,
“I don't need no job from you, Kay-Rita,</i>

01:13:54.012 --> 01:13:58.182
<i>'cause I got me a job at the Kroger.”</i>
Ooh-hoo! Go on, girl!

01:13:58.183 --> 01:14:00.977
<i>And she wasn't lyin', either.
Got her a job!</i>

01:14:00.978 --> 01:14:04.021
<i>And last week
they made me assistant manager.</i>

01:14:04.022 --> 01:14:07.608
Damn. A manager? Oh, girl.

01:14:07.609 --> 01:14:11.905
<i>Teisha, quit. Lord, this baby is strong.</i>
Bye, Teisha. Bye, baby.

01:14:16.869 --> 01:14:19.162
<i>She doin' real good, Juanita.</i>

01:14:19.163 --> 01:14:21.747
Maybe I oughta leave home more often.

01:14:21.748 --> 01:14:24.543
<i>I guess so. When you coming back?</i>

01:14:25.961 --> 01:14:28.004
Not for a while.

01:14:28.005 --> 01:14:32.675
<i>Oh. You like living in… What is it?
Paper Cup? Paper Towel? What is it?</i>

01:14:32.676 --> 01:14:36.762
Paper Moon, fool.
<i>Paper Moon. Right.</i>

01:14:36.763 --> 01:14:41.350
<i>Girl, I can't even find it on the Google.</i>
That's 'cause it's just little.

01:14:41.351 --> 01:14:44.353
<i>See, I couldn't do that.</i>
Why not?

01:14:44.354 --> 01:14:46.272
<i>It's bigger than your neighborhood.</i>

01:14:46.273 --> 01:14:50.569
Oh, so now it's my neighborhood? Shit.
You was livin' here six weeks ago.

01:14:51.195 --> 01:14:54.614
And you just gonna what,
live in Paper Plate the rest of your life?

01:14:56.241 --> 01:14:58.409
<i>Look here, when Randy showed up,</i>

01:14:58.410 --> 01:15:01.078
<i>the black population
of Paper Moon doubled.</i>

01:15:01.079 --> 01:15:04.832
If y'all come, all the white folks
just might up and move out.

01:15:04.833 --> 01:15:08.669
Then it'd just be us and the Indians.
We'd have the whole place to ourselves.

01:15:08.670 --> 01:15:11.964
Speaking of Indians,
tell me about Cochise.

01:15:14.301 --> 01:15:16.512
Jess Gardiner.

01:15:18.013 --> 01:15:22.017
He's nice and good and all that shit.

01:15:23.018 --> 01:15:26.270
But… I don't wanna talk about him.

01:15:26.271 --> 01:15:27.813
<i>Why not?</i>

01:15:27.814 --> 01:15:29.857
Because my trip ain't over.

01:15:29.858 --> 01:15:34.446
And if I come back here
after I go to California…

01:15:35.489 --> 01:15:37.782
then we can talk about Jess Gardiner.

01:15:37.783 --> 01:15:40.076
<i>Oh. All right.</i>

01:15:40.077 --> 01:15:43.956
Now. No stalling. Where Rashawn at?

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:48.292
<i>Well, he out of jail.</i>

01:15:48.293 --> 01:15:51.671
<i>He on probation
'cause he's a first-time offender.</i>

01:15:51.672 --> 01:15:55.716
<i>But he's got to do
100 hours of community service</i>

01:15:55.717 --> 01:15:57.803
<i>or else he going back to jail.</i>

01:15:59.096 --> 01:16:02.139
<i>I don't know if he gonna
stay off them corners though.</i>

01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:04.142
<i>I mean, I just don't know.</i>

01:16:05.018 --> 01:16:06.728
<i>Hey, I believe he will.</i>

01:16:07.521 --> 01:16:10.147
<i>Hey. Rita, I got to go.</i>

01:16:10.148 --> 01:16:13.609
<i>How I look?</i>
Oh, you look good, girl!

01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:16.946
Ooh!
Did you get a makeover or somethin'?

01:16:16.947 --> 01:16:18.656
Ha, ha!

01:16:18.657 --> 01:16:19.865
Or somethin'.

01:16:21.952 --> 01:16:25.205
Bye-bye, my sister.
<i>Come on, y'all. Come on. Say, “Bye.”</i>

01:16:25.747 --> 01:16:28.416
Thank you.
<i>Bye. Say, “Bye.”</i>

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:29.668
<i>Bye.</i>

01:16:30.919 --> 01:16:33.839
Okay, who had the trout amandine?

01:16:39.845 --> 01:16:42.138
Millsy says he caught this up in Alaska.

01:16:42.139 --> 01:16:43.473
Huh.

01:16:44.891 --> 01:16:46.559
Oh, bullshit.

01:16:48.562 --> 01:16:50.438
Hey, Peaches.
Hey, sug'.

01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:52.773
Hey, fellas. How's it hangin'?
Good.

01:16:52.774 --> 01:16:55.568
Lower and lower.
“Springtime fresh.”

01:16:55.569 --> 01:16:57.820
Comfy.
Hey, girl.

01:16:57.821 --> 01:17:00.364
Mary, what's the specials today?
Trout amandine,

01:17:00.365 --> 01:17:04.619
medallions with beef on pommes frites,
and Mediterranean smothered chicken.

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:07.039
All right.
I'll have all of them and a Diet Coke.

01:17:08.373 --> 01:17:09.582
Gimme the chicken.

01:17:09.583 --> 01:17:12.001
Glad to see nothing's changed.
Pickup!

01:17:12.002 --> 01:17:14.420
Hey, Jess.
You're looking nice.

01:17:14.421 --> 01:17:16.881
Two more and a poached egg salad.

01:17:16.882 --> 01:17:18.841
Salade des œufs. Say it.

01:17:18.842 --> 01:17:21.135
Salade des “oof.”

01:17:21.136 --> 01:17:22.678
I say it for the customers.

01:17:22.679 --> 01:17:25.264
Say it to me.
I love when you talk dirty.

01:17:25.265 --> 01:17:27.016
Oh, Lord.

01:17:27.017 --> 01:17:29.935
Ordering Mediterranean smothered chicken
for Peaches.

01:17:29.936 --> 01:17:33.023
Chicken. Got it. Poulet étouffé.

01:17:34.608 --> 01:17:37.360
Who's the new cook?
Randy, come meet Peaches.

01:17:37.361 --> 01:17:39.112
This is Juanita's oldest son.

01:17:40.030 --> 01:17:42.991
Well, hello, Juanita's oldest son.

01:17:44.326 --> 01:17:46.536
Speaking of dates,
how's my new girlfriend?

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:48.788
Your girlfriend?

01:17:48.789 --> 01:17:50.706
I have to go get her.

01:17:50.707 --> 01:17:54.085
Peaches, make yourself useful.
Don't forget the eggs.

01:17:54.086 --> 01:17:55.337
Eggs! Sh...

01:18:01.718 --> 01:18:04.261
Come on, woman. I got no time.

01:18:04.262 --> 01:18:07.139
You also ain't got no manners.

01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:08.392
Just get in.

01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:13.688
I don't know why, but I'm gonna miss you.

01:18:13.689 --> 01:18:14.940
Then don't go.

01:18:15.774 --> 01:18:18.567
You know, I've been to California.

01:18:18.568 --> 01:18:20.529
All the people there are shallow.

01:18:21.905 --> 01:18:24.323
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

01:18:24.324 --> 01:18:27.327
You all deep and shit.
Hell yeah.

01:18:55.689 --> 01:18:57.023
Eyes closed.

01:19:01.945 --> 01:19:04.823
Keep 'em closed.
They're closed.

01:19:10.370 --> 01:19:12.538
All right. There you go.

01:19:12.539 --> 01:19:14.666
Oh...

01:19:15.333 --> 01:19:17.586
I got you.
Oh, God.

01:19:19.129 --> 01:19:22.089
There we go.
I'm getting dizzy.

01:19:22.090 --> 01:19:24.175
We got it. Watch out!

01:19:24.176 --> 01:19:26.011
That's not funny.

01:19:27.596 --> 01:19:31.016
Close your eyes.
I'm getting dizzy.

01:19:32.559 --> 01:19:36.604
All right. Here we are.

01:19:36.605 --> 01:19:37.647
Hold it.

01:19:39.983 --> 01:19:43.611
Open your eyes. Now, I will be here.

01:19:43.612 --> 01:19:47.908
And this place will be here
whenever you wanna come back.

01:19:52.662 --> 01:19:55.749
Voilà. “Chez J and J.”

01:20:02.088 --> 01:20:05.175
That's nice. It's nice.

01:20:05.675 --> 01:20:07.427
And they will too.

01:20:09.221 --> 01:20:11.848
Surprise!

01:20:17.813 --> 01:20:18.939
Yeah!

01:20:27.447 --> 01:20:29.908
Get a room!
Close your eyes.

01:20:32.702 --> 01:20:35.497
California, here we come.

01:20:36.581 --> 01:20:37.748
Come on, girl.

01:20:37.749 --> 01:20:41.795
Peaches, you got some precious
cargo there now. You take care of her.

01:20:43.797 --> 01:20:45.048
Have a safe trip.

01:21:36.266 --> 01:21:38.601
I knew it.

01:21:38.602 --> 01:21:43.355
I knew that if I waited long enough,
you'd come back to me, Juanita.

01:21:43.356 --> 01:21:46.108
Hey, Blair Underwood.
Hey!

01:21:47.569 --> 01:21:50.988
Ain't it a little early for that?
Nah, it's the weekend.

01:21:50.989 --> 01:21:52.490
It's Tuesday morning.

01:21:53.366 --> 01:21:57.870
Right. Well, it's Tuesday brunch.
It's a Hollywood thing.

01:21:57.871 --> 01:21:59.872
You want some?
No.

01:21:59.873 --> 01:22:01.374
Here.
No, you go ahead.

01:22:02.125 --> 01:22:03.168
All right.

01:22:05.253 --> 01:22:06.671
So look here, Juanita.

01:22:07.213 --> 01:22:12.301
Uh, so this whole you-and-me thing
ain't gonna work out no more, huh?

01:22:12.302 --> 01:22:14.511
Nope. Not a chance.

01:22:14.512 --> 01:22:16.388
All right. I'm good with that.

01:22:16.389 --> 01:22:20.017
Say, Juanita, you remember
that cooking show I told you about?

01:22:20.018 --> 01:22:23.395
Mm-hmm. I remember.
“Cooking with Blair Underwood.”

01:22:23.396 --> 01:22:24.981
Right? Right?

01:22:25.690 --> 01:22:30.361
So, we've run into a little bit
of what I call a cash flow problem.

01:22:30.362 --> 01:22:32.405
I got to go, Blair Underwood.

01:22:34.324 --> 01:22:36.034
Oh, okay. Sure.

01:22:37.577 --> 01:22:38.620
Juanita?

01:22:40.997 --> 01:22:42.457
You look really nice.

01:22:44.125 --> 01:22:47.087
Did you get a makeover or something?
Ha!

01:22:48.588 --> 01:22:50.131
