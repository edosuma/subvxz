Uh... Golly, Gordon.
Professor Moffat and I
are simply old friends.

00:20.667 --> 00:23.700
Sure, Brains.
Like nobody can feel
all that nerd-trino energy

00:23.767 --> 00:25.300
with the two of you
in a room together.

00:27.200 --> 00:28.967

Lady Penelope

00:29.033 --> 00:31.233
while she and Parker are on
bodyguard for the Professor.

00:31.300 --> 00:34.333
They're heading for
a Global Defense Force
research facility in Iceland.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.333
Seems, while we were having
all that fun with gravity,

00:36.400 --> 00:39.933
her accelerator coughed up
some kind of wacky
new quantum particle.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.100
Moffy... Professor Moffat,
is calling it Centurium 21.

00:44.167 --> 00:48.367
And her early research
suggests it could be
the big breakthrough

00:48.433 --> 00:50.500
in the field
of zero point energy.

00:50.567 --> 00:52.033
Colonel Casey says
our friend The Hood

00:52.100 --> 00:54.767

several attempts
to steal it from the GDF.

just fly it there?

01:02.133 --> 01:03.633
That's part of the problem,
Alan.

01:03.700 --> 01:07.733
The Centurium 21 is stabilized
in a gravitonic flask.

01:07.800 --> 01:11.733
But at altitude,
unfortunately, it still
reacts erratically

01:11.800 --> 01:15.133
to even micro-changes in the
Earth's magnetic fields.

The Professor has moved
all the passengers
to this compartment.

15:46.333 --> 15:48.867
And we're sealed like a drum.
Perfect. Lady P?

15:48.933 --> 15:50.567

15:51.867 --> 15:53.767

dead on his tail?

16:33.467 --> 16:34.867
PARKER: Like glue, ma'am.

16:34.933 --> 16:39.500
But these ocean canyons keep
wavering the locator signal.

-He could be almost anywhere.

16:42.367 --> 16:44.267

he couldn't.

have nobbled our turbines.

PARKER: Yes, m'lady.

17:18.667 --> 17:20.333
Ah! He's getting away.

17:21.767 --> 17:24.667
GORDON: We're losing aft

GORDON: (GRUNTS) I can't make
the lift power.

17:45.533 --> 17:47.100
My turbines are overloading.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.500
No, no, no, no!

17:48.567 --> 17:52.400
Gordon, it looks like
that airbag pump
has a blockage.

17:52.467 --> 17:54.233
-I can't clear it remotely.

Thunderbird 4.

18:25.667 --> 18:27.533
I'll take it from here
with the cable.

18:28.767 --> 18:29.833
The cable!

18:29.900 --> 18:31.200
Thanks, Virgil.

18:31.267 --> 18:33.167
I just had an idea.

A little too nippy for us to
catch up, I'm afraid, m'lady.

Although, apparently,
our locator seems to be
still inside.

20:35.667 --> 20:38.800

Thanks to Gordon salvaging
the gravitonic casket from
The Hood's ship,

we still got the Centurium 21
to the GDF facility in time.

And kept it out of that

Hey, improvisation's

in Iceland, Moffy?

trying to get rid of me.

at least tease me

-with this allegedly
fabulous lab of yours.
