00:13.096 --> 00:15.098
...the johnson.

00:15.181 --> 00:19.519
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson
is one hot Paul Bunyan.

00:19.602 --> 00:22.564
I've got morning wood... to chop.

00:22.981 --> 00:24.232
-[growls]
-Hyah!

00:25.483 --> 00:26.568
Oh, yeah!

00:26.651 --> 00:30.113
Damn, Paul, your sticky chest
gave me blue balls.

00:30.196 --> 00:34.617
[announcer]  This fall, Paul Bunyan
takes on the Big Apple

00:34.701 --> 00:36.369
and swallows every bite.

00:36.453 --> 00:37.662
[man]  Yum-yum!

00:38.538 --> 00:42.709
Oh, my God, that movie looks so good.

00:42.792 --> 00:44.210
Yeah, it's a movie, it's gonna be great.

00:44.294 --> 00:46.546
That's it. I'm getting us tickets
the second they go on sale.

00:47.213 --> 00:49.299
Uh, you actually
don't have to get me one.

00:49.382 --> 00:50.759
What? We see every movie together.

00:50.842 --> 00:52.886
Well, Jessi and I are going out now...

00:52.969 --> 00:54.262
-Oh!
-and so--

00:54.345 --> 00:55.764
-And you feel like you should go with her?
-Well--

00:55.847 --> 00:59.809
-Yeah, that-- that totally makes sense.
-But we can watch the trailer together.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.436
Nick, I'd like that very much.

01:01.519 --> 01:03.396
All right, loading.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.356
[online voices panting, grunting]

01:05.440 --> 01:07.484
Oh! Bryan Singer directed this.

What's up, my man? You page me?
Who we hard for?

01:15.950 --> 01:18.411
-Well, um...
-Rihanna? The Land O' Lakes butter chick?

01:18.495 --> 01:19.704
-Um...
-Oh!

01:19.788 --> 01:22.540
-The Rock gave you a boner.
-No! What? No!

01:22.624 --> 01:25.543
No way, this is a fluke.
You know I have no control over these.

01:25.627 --> 01:28.254
Like, remember when I saw
that particularly plump tomato?

01:28.338 --> 01:31.925
Yeah, yeah, could be a fluke,
or maybe... you're gay.

01:32.008 --> 01:34.010
Okay, that's crazy, all right?

01:34.093 --> 01:36.054
All I do is fantasize about girls.

01:36.137 --> 01:39.057
Only one way to find out.
Okay, have a seat.

01:39.766 --> 01:43.102
-Er, should I take off my glasses?
-Oh, no, no. This isn't an eye test.

01:43.186 --> 01:44.646
It's a gay test.

01:44.729 --> 01:47.440
[Hormone Monster]
Now tell me-- number one, or number two?

01:47.524 --> 01:49.359
-[Andrew] Number one...?
-Interesting.

01:49.442 --> 01:51.319
Number one, number two?

01:51.402 --> 01:53.196
-[Andrew] Number two...?
-Cool, cool.

01:53.279 --> 01:56.574
-Number one, number two?
-[Andrew] Can I see number one again?

01:56.658 --> 01:58.326
-Yeah.
-[Andrew] Number one?

01:58.409 --> 02:01.329
Interesting.
Okay, number one, or number two?

02:01.412 --> 02:03.123
-[gasps] Oh, my God.
-Number two, right?

02:03.206 --> 02:07.210
-Maybe I  am  gay.
-Okay, all right. That's good to know.

02:07.293 --> 02:09.337
Wait, what-- don't write this down.
Are you filling out a form?

02:09.420 --> 02:11.422
No, I'm just drawing a picture
of a unicorn...

02:11.506 --> 02:14.884
-Oh, you have a sweet side.
-...buttfucking Mr. Clean!

02:51.671 --> 02:52.839
Mmm.

02:52.922 --> 02:55.091
It's good, the water.

02:55.174 --> 02:59.178
Yeah, I hear tap water's good
'cause there's fluoride in it.

02:59.262 --> 03:01.681
-Cool.
-Cool.

03:02.849 --> 03:05.810
-Andrew did the funniest thing today.
-Oh, God, tell me. What did he do?

03:05.894 --> 03:07.979
-[chuckles] His fruit snacks...
-Uh-huh?

03:08.062 --> 03:10.481
-...they melted into one big fruit snack.
-Uh-huh?

03:11.649 --> 03:14.611
-And then what happened?
-And then he, um, well, he ate it.

03:14.694 --> 03:17.071
Oh. I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

03:17.155 --> 03:20.199
-Cool, cool.  El baño.
-I'm sorry, what?

03:20.283 --> 03:23.369
[stammers] Oh, uh, Span--
um,  "El baño"  is Spanish for--

03:23.453 --> 03:25.079
-Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom now.
-Okay.

03:25.163 --> 03:26.039
[pattering]

03:26.915 --> 03:31.294
Ugh! That was positively painful,
my pretty little  pupusa.

03:31.377 --> 03:34.005
I know. We used to have so much fun.

03:34.088 --> 03:38.635
-Why is it so weird now?
-Because you two do not belong together.

03:38.718 --> 03:41.930
-But I really like Nick.
-As a friend.

03:42.013 --> 03:44.724
But remember when y'all did
your Frenched kiss?

03:44.807 --> 03:47.936
-What did you  feel?
-Not much.

03:48.019 --> 03:49.145
How's it supposed to feel?

03:49.229 --> 03:51.981
Like Stanley Kowalski picking you up
and thrusting you

03:52.065 --> 03:54.651
onto a kitchen counter
like you weigh nothing.

03:54.734 --> 03:56.778
I don't know who that is
but that does sound good.

03:56.861 --> 04:00.114
There's a reason they named
that streetcar Desire.

04:00.198 --> 04:02.825
-Now go out there and lose that boy.
-[moans]

04:04.160 --> 04:06.996
I've got morning wood... to chop.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.207
Lights out. It's 9:05.

04:09.290 --> 04:12.418
Hey, Dad, um...
can I ask you something?

04:12.502 --> 04:16.089
Me? Okay, fine, but the lights stay off.
I don't own stock in Con Ed.

04:16.172 --> 04:19.342
Um, when did you start to like women?

04:19.425 --> 04:21.970
-Women? Ugh. Can't stand women.
-Really?

04:22.053 --> 04:24.722
Don't care for men, either.
I don't like people in general.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.891
-Well, what about Mom?
-Well, I love your mother,

04:26.975 --> 04:29.018
but don't tell her that. Who else?

04:29.102 --> 04:31.437
I would say that there's about
four other people--

04:31.521 --> 04:33.439
Terry Bradshaw, of course.

04:33.523 --> 04:36.025
There's a Metro North conductor
who's good.

04:36.109 --> 04:39.612
My cousin Eugene...
no, that's it. I think that's it.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.739
I think three.
Yeah, I like three people.

04:41.823 --> 04:44.659
-Andrew, did this talk help?
-I guess?

04:44.742 --> 04:48.121
Good. I'm gonna go lie down on the floor
in the den and open mail.

04:50.498 --> 04:53.376
-Thanks for dinner.
-Yeah, sorry I sent back my food.

04:53.459 --> 04:55.920
See, I thought tilapia
was a kind of pasta.

04:56.004 --> 04:59.048
-No, it's a fish.
-Yeah, no, no, I know that now.

04:59.132 --> 05:03.261
You know, I was thinking,
we were so good as friends.

05:03.344 --> 05:06.431
-So good.
-So maybe we should just be friends again?

05:06.514 --> 05:09.309
I love that. That's what this is missing,
right? Being friends.

05:09.392 --> 05:12.270
[sighs] Oh, Good.
I'm so glad you feel the same way.

05:12.895 --> 05:15.398
Nick! Nice blazer, my man.

05:15.481 --> 05:17.150
Thanks. I got it
for my aunt's first wedding.

05:17.233 --> 05:19.485
Love's a journey, dude.
She'll figure it out.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.571
-You ready, Jellybean?
-Yep. Bye, Nick.

05:21.654 --> 05:23.406
And thanks again.

05:24.657 --> 05:28.202
This is so great!
I'm friends with my girlfriend.

05:29.329 --> 05:32.373
Judd, anything special
going on in school today?

05:32.457 --> 05:34.834
-No.
-[chuckles] Terrific.

05:34.917 --> 05:37.253
So mysterious.
I get such a kick out of this kid.

05:37.336 --> 05:42.258
-Nick, how was your big date last night?
-It started out a little awkward,

05:42.341 --> 05:45.595
but then Jessi had this idea
that we would just be friends again

05:45.678 --> 05:47.513
and now I'm really excited about it.

05:47.597 --> 05:48.431
[Judd chuckles]

05:48.514 --> 05:50.558
-Oh, honey.
-What?

05:50.641 --> 05:54.729
Did she say just be friends
or "just be friends"?

05:54.812 --> 05:57.440
-Is there a difference?
-I'll rip that little bitch to shreds.

05:57.523 --> 06:00.735
-What?
-It sounds like she broke up with you.

06:00.818 --> 06:04.947
No. Guys, nobody dumped anyone.
We're still going out. We're just friends.

06:05.031 --> 06:07.408
She made you feel
like it was  your  idea, didn't she?

06:07.492 --> 06:09.327
That's exactly what I did
to Tyler Kinney.

06:09.410 --> 06:12.830
You remember Tyler. He tried to light
himself on fire in our front yard.

06:12.914 --> 06:15.208
-Oh, man, Jessi dumped me.
-Ha!

06:15.291 --> 06:17.960
-Everyone's gonna think I'm a loser.
-Well, you're a winner to me.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.213
-Wanna go on a date with your old man?
-No!

06:20.296 --> 06:22.256
-Oh, my God.
-[whispers] Light yourself on fire.

06:22.340 --> 06:23.257
[class bell rings]

06:24.550 --> 06:26.094
Hey, um, Matthew?

06:26.177 --> 06:28.888
Oh, look, the lost and found
became a person.

06:28.971 --> 06:30.890
Uh, I was wondering-- if you don't mind--

06:30.973 --> 06:35.478
um, how did you know
that you were, um... gay?

06:35.561 --> 06:37.313
Sorry, you're the only gay person I know.

06:37.396 --> 06:40.983
Uh, I'm the only gay person
you  know  you know.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.318
Why are we talking about this?

06:42.485 --> 06:45.571
[gasps] Oh-hh...!
You think you're gay.

06:45.655 --> 06:49.325
What? No! No.
Well, yeah. I'm not sure.

06:49.408 --> 06:52.620
No, I can see it.
I mean, you suck at being straight.

06:52.703 --> 06:55.164
Hi, Andrew, I just wanted
to preemptively let you know

06:55.248 --> 06:58.584
-that I'm not interested in you.
-And may I say that I fully understand

06:58.668 --> 07:00.628
-and I thank you for your candor.
-You're welcome.

07:00.711 --> 07:02.922
That. That, too. You're weirdly formal,

07:03.005 --> 07:05.508
like the kind of gay guy
who's in the Air Force

07:05.591 --> 07:08.719
and then became middle management at IBM,
and you have a condo,

07:08.803 --> 07:10.430
and there's like, a side gym
in the building.

07:10.513 --> 07:13.182
That sounds like a nice little life
I've made for myself.

07:13.266 --> 07:16.519
Let's face it, Andrew,
if you're asking, you're probably gay.

07:16.602 --> 07:18.646
"Probably gay"?
What does that even mean?

07:18.729 --> 07:20.731
Not my job.
I have morning announcements,

07:20.815 --> 07:24.485
-and you have, like, a pear shape.
-Oh, God.

07:25.236 --> 07:27.447
[music playing]

07:27.530 --> 07:29.407
Lacrosse tryouts are tomorrow.

07:29.490 --> 07:33.494
Exciting news for rich sociopaths
with a loose concept of consent.

07:33.578 --> 07:36.706
But let's move on to something
actually care about--

07:36.789 --> 07:38.958
Nick and Jessi.

07:39.041 --> 07:41.544
Everyone wants to know
who broke up with who,

07:41.627 --> 07:44.422
and here to give us the inside scoop
is Nick.

07:45.673 --> 07:50.970
Nick, tell us, in your own tiny words,
who dumped who?

07:51.053 --> 07:54.599
[chuckles]  First of all,
I really don't like the word "dump."

07:54.682 --> 07:58.394
I find it offensive. I mean, does
it really matter who broke up with who?

07:58.478 --> 08:01.689
-Of course it does. You know that.
-Okay, here's what I will say--

08:01.772 --> 08:04.400
I think Jessi is a fantastic girl,

08:04.484 --> 08:08.821
and that's why it was so hard
for  me  to break up with  her.

08:09.363 --> 08:10.948
-[all gasp]
-[Matthew]  You heard it here--

08:11.032 --> 08:13.701
- Nick dumped Jessi.
-[growls]

08:15.203 --> 08:16.287
Angry.

08:16.579 --> 08:22.126
We shall reach up that little pygmy's ass
and pull out his heart!

08:22.210 --> 08:24.879
-[thunderclap crashes]
-His ass heart!

08:24.962 --> 08:28.883
Tomorrow, an exclusive interview
with Patient Zero in our pinkeye epidemic.

08:28.966 --> 08:33.846
Yeah, looking back, there was definitely
fecal matter on some of the basketballs.

08:33.930 --> 08:38.142
This is Coach Steve, by the way.
Ooh, I can't believe I'm gonna be on TV!

08:38.226 --> 08:39.560
[faint barking]

08:39.644 --> 08:41.020
[whistling]

08:41.103 --> 08:45.358
Okay, so, normally right about now
I'd watch the Mets game.

08:45.441 --> 08:49.487
But if I'm probably gay,
maybe I should--

08:49.570 --> 08:51.948
Definitely watch gay porn.

08:52.031 --> 08:54.617
I know, I know, but I've been scared
to look at  any  porn.

08:54.700 --> 08:58.037
Isn't going directly to gay porn
like jumping head first into the deep end?

08:58.120 --> 09:01.040
More like dick first into the butt end.
Nailed it.

09:01.123 --> 09:02.124
[clicking]

09:02.208 --> 09:05.336
Don't just type in "gay porn."
Switch over to private browsing first.

09:05.419 --> 09:06.420
Good call, good call.

09:06.504 --> 09:09.674
We're gonna have to clear more cookies
than a fat kid at a birthday party.

09:09.757 --> 09:11.467
[laughs]
Nailed it again.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.385
-[clicking]
-Um...

09:12.468 --> 09:15.471
All right, Andrew, this is your journey.
You must be your own shaman.

09:15.555 --> 09:16.639
Ugh...

09:16.722 --> 09:18.891
-Click the mouse.
-Okay. Here goes.

09:19.892 --> 09:21.394
-[clicks]
-[siren wails]

09:22.061 --> 09:23.938
-Well, all right.
-Shit. Wait. What's this?

09:24.021 --> 09:25.231
-That's good.
-Wait. Close that.

09:25.314 --> 09:27.149
-That won't close. Why won't this close?
-[Hormone Monster] Open that one.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.986
-No, I don't want to zoom.
-Yes! Yes!

09:30.069 --> 09:31.862
-[Andrew] Stop clicking on it!
-It's got a life of its own!

09:31.946 --> 09:35.575
Virus, virus! Shame on you!

09:35.658 --> 09:38.411
-[Dad] Andrew, what's going on up there?
-Nothing! I'm asleep.

09:38.494 --> 09:41.581
[Dad]
Well, something's wrong with the computer.

09:41.664 --> 09:44.542
Terry Bradshaw's taking a shower
with Howie Long,

09:44.625 --> 09:47.211
and why does Shannon Sharpe
want to get in there?

09:47.295 --> 09:49.380
Oh, my God!
[thumps]

09:49.463 --> 09:50.715
[bell rings]

09:50.798 --> 09:53.634
Ooh, how'd you break up with Jessi?
Did you make her cry?

09:53.718 --> 09:56.554
To be honest, it was, like,
the hardest thing I've ever had to do

09:56.637 --> 09:59.515
but it was the right thing to do.
Does that make sense?

09:59.599 --> 10:02.059
-Ha! You my dawg.
-Nick Birch!

10:07.023 --> 10:09.400
Looks like I picked the right outfit
this morning.

10:10.234 --> 10:12.486
Jessi, it's-- ahem, good to see you.

10:12.570 --> 10:14.280
-Is it?
-What's going on?

10:14.363 --> 10:16.407
I can't see. My eyes are crusted shut.

10:16.490 --> 10:18.576
Look, we could still be friends.

10:19.493 --> 10:21.412
Friends? Ha!

10:21.495 --> 10:23.581
Oh, we're  not  friends.

10:23.664 --> 10:25.833
Cut that little pipsqueak down to size.

10:25.916 --> 10:29.629
And to set the record straight,
I  broke up with  you.

10:29.712 --> 10:31.797
-Well, it was mutual.
-No, no, no.

10:31.881 --> 10:34.300
-Gun him down.
-I knew it wasn't gonna work

10:34.383 --> 10:38.387
as soon as I kissed
your big, weird catfish mouth.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.765
-[all gasp]
-Yeah, paint a picture, baby.

10:40.848 --> 10:43.351
Jessi, let's not forget  you  kissed  me.

10:43.434 --> 10:46.103
-Oh, I'll never forget.
-Sing it, sister.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.897
Just with your giant blubbery lips

10:47.980 --> 10:50.524
it felt like I was chewing
on two lukewarm hot dogs.

10:50.608 --> 10:52.485
-Okay.
-More, more, more!

10:52.568 --> 10:56.739
The gross poking and prodding
from your scaly alligator tongue.

10:56.822 --> 10:58.658
Rub his nose in it.

10:58.741 --> 11:03.996
And I  pity  the poor girl who makes
the mistake of kissing you next.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.749
You're gonna hear that from time to time.
It's part of the game.

11:06.832 --> 11:08.751
But that's not gonna happen.

11:08.834 --> 11:12.630
'Cause I'm gonna tell everyone
that you, Nick Birch,

11:12.713 --> 11:16.133
[screams]
are the world's  worst  kisser!

11:16.217 --> 11:17.343
[all gasp]

11:18.469 --> 11:21.347
Yippie-ki-yay, motherfucker.

11:21.430 --> 11:23.099
Now let's mosey.

11:25.518 --> 11:28.354
Aw, don't worry about it, Nick.
Opinions are like assholes--

11:28.437 --> 11:31.023
keep 'em away
from your basketballs, all right?

11:31.107 --> 11:32.024
[distant dog barking]

11:32.108 --> 11:34.235
Okay, okay, you gotta get back at Jessi.

11:34.318 --> 11:36.112
-Jay.
-And I've got just the idea.

11:36.195 --> 11:37.905
-Jay--
-It's a little bit juvenile,

11:37.988 --> 11:39.990
but it's simple and it's timeless.

11:40.074 --> 11:42.243
-Jay--
-We let it be known that Jessi,

11:42.326 --> 11:47.623
-for a snack, eats tiny pieces of shit.
-What? She doesn't eat pieces of shit.

11:47.706 --> 11:50.042
Andrew, you're picturing it
and we're talking about it.

11:50.126 --> 11:51.585
-That's a win in my book.
-Wait, wait, wait.

11:51.669 --> 11:54.213
I'm not gonna say that Jessi eats shit.

11:54.296 --> 11:57.049
We're in a fight but ultimately
we're still friends, right?

11:57.133 --> 12:00.469
No! She  was  your friend,
then she was your lover,

12:00.553 --> 12:02.263
now she's your enemy.

12:02.346 --> 12:04.974
Please stop quoting your dad's
divorce lawyer commercials.

12:05.057 --> 12:08.018
Okay, fine. We'll take the high road.
We'll just say she's a lesbo.

12:08.102 --> 12:11.021
No, if I call her a lesbo,
then she's gonna say that I'm gay.

12:11.105 --> 12:13.983
And, hey, is--
that's a bad thing, right?

12:14.066 --> 12:15.734
Like if people think you're gay
that's bad?

12:15.818 --> 12:18.320
-No, we all know it's okay to be gay.
-Do we?

12:18.404 --> 12:21.699
I mean, if it's so "okay" to be gay,

12:21.782 --> 12:23.701
then why are you so afraid
to be called gay?

12:23.784 --> 12:25.411
-Because I'm not.
-But if you were--

12:25.494 --> 12:26.704
-It'd be a nightmare.
-Why?

12:26.787 --> 12:28.330
Why? Come on, Andrew.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.374
No girl's gonna hook up with you
if you're gay.

12:30.458 --> 12:33.043
They'll think all you do is stick
your dick inside other dudes' dicks.

12:33.127 --> 12:36.338
Jay, gay people don't stick their dicks
inside other dicks.

12:36.422 --> 12:37.882
You're picturing it
and we're talking about it.

12:37.965 --> 12:40.009
-I'm not picturing that.
-Let me ask you this--

12:40.092 --> 12:42.970
would you rather that lesbo
call you "catfish mouth" or gay?

12:43.053 --> 12:44.346
I don't want to be called either.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.891
Because being gay is as bad
as having a catfish mouth.

12:46.974 --> 12:48.100
We're all on the same page.

12:48.184 --> 12:50.394
-What's so bad about being gay?
-Nothing.

12:50.478 --> 12:52.605
It just seems kinda hard to be gay.

12:52.688 --> 12:55.191
Oh, it's really hard. I mean,
have you ever looked at gay porn?

12:55.274 --> 12:58.027
-What? No.
-Neither have I, right? Okay.

12:58.110 --> 13:00.321
Now if you'll excuse me, bathroom.

13:00.863 --> 13:04.492
Okay, okay, how about this-- we'll say
Jessi puts peanut butter on her dog's dick

13:04.575 --> 13:06.076
and licks it off. Yum, yum, yum.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.537
Aren't you supposed to put
the peanut butter on your  own  dick?

13:08.621 --> 13:11.415
Oh. Wow. That would feel way better.

13:11.999 --> 13:16.545
Um, hello? Mr. Ghost of Duke Ellington?
It's Andrew.

13:16.629 --> 13:19.632
Why, hello, Andrew!
[laughs]

13:19.715 --> 13:21.759
Are you doing a report on me for school?

13:21.842 --> 13:26.180
Here's a fun fact-- Stevie Wonder
wrote the song "Sir Duke" about  me.

13:26.263 --> 13:29.266
And he's been faking his blindness
his entire life.

13:29.350 --> 13:32.186
That sounds like
a crazy conspiracy theory.

13:32.269 --> 13:34.855
[laughing]
You should hear my views on 9/11.

13:34.939 --> 13:38.400
How come all the Jews knew
not to come to work that day?

13:38.484 --> 13:40.611
No, that's been proven to be untrue.

13:40.694 --> 13:44.365
You're picturing it
and we're talking about it. [laughs]

13:44.949 --> 13:48.869
Anyway, Duke, I wanted your advice,
and I guess I still do.

13:48.953 --> 13:53.123
You see, Duke, I'm probably gay
and it is scary.

13:53.207 --> 13:57.836
Only if you find disposable income
and terrific summer houses scary.

13:57.920 --> 13:58.837
[laughing]

13:58.921 --> 14:01.131
Did you know any gay people
when you were alive?

14:01.215 --> 14:04.426
Of course! I was in show business,

14:04.510 --> 14:06.804
the official profession of the gay people.

14:06.887 --> 14:12.017
Allow me to introduce you
to famous deceased homosexuals

14:12.101 --> 14:14.687
Socrates, Freddie Mercury,

14:14.770 --> 14:18.482
and Justice Antonin Scalia.

14:18.566 --> 14:20.943
Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia?

14:21.026 --> 14:22.987
But weren't you famously anti-gay?

14:23.070 --> 14:27.366
I was deep in the closet,
and I wish I came out while I was alive.

14:27.449 --> 14:32.371
Ghost cock is like vegan bacon--
it just isn't as good as the real thing.

14:32.454 --> 14:34.999
-And it has a weird texture.
-Wow, yeah.

14:35.082 --> 14:38.210
Also, it's the best time to be gay
since ancient Greece.

14:38.294 --> 14:39.879
Huh. I had no idea.

14:39.962 --> 14:41.797
As long as you live on one of the coasts,

14:41.881 --> 14:45.134
or Austin, Texas--
that place is keeping it weird.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.344
Being gay can be bloody brilliant.

14:47.428 --> 14:50.306
-How so, Freddie Mercury?
-I was hoping you would ask.

that I'm a proud gay man.

Okay, what's next?
How am I supposed to dress?

16:29.571 --> 16:32.074
How do I meet other gay people?
How do I find a boyfriend?

16:32.157 --> 16:34.868
Well, first of all,
you already  have  a boyfriend.

16:34.952 --> 16:36.620
-What? Who?
-"Peanut."

16:36.704 --> 16:38.038
-Who?
-"Little Purse Dog."

16:38.122 --> 16:40.916
-Purse Dog?
-"Mr. Teddy Graham."

16:41.000 --> 16:43.669
-Nick?
-Yes! "Little Baby Salt Shaker."

16:43.752 --> 16:46.588
What? No, Nick's not my boyfriend.
We're just best friends.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.966
Oh, please!
You do everything together.

16:49.049 --> 16:52.344
You're always making each other jealous,
getting in your stupid little fights.

16:52.428 --> 16:55.848
-It's classic. You're a tall and a short.
-Is that a thing?

16:55.931 --> 16:58.392
Everything in the gay community
is a thing.

16:58.475 --> 17:00.894
Also, bye-ee!

17:02.271 --> 17:06.692
He's right, it's Nick.
It's always been Nick.

17:06.775 --> 17:08.569
So what's up?
You officially gay?

17:08.652 --> 17:11.238
What? Yes. Where have you been?

17:11.321 --> 17:14.783
I'm sorry, I was inducting
my dear friend Joe Walsh

17:14.867 --> 17:16.827
into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

17:16.910 --> 17:21.123
And as long as he's around,
rock and roll will never die.

17:21.206 --> 17:26.253
Ladies and gentlemen, Eagles legend
and my brother-in-arms, Mr. Joe--

17:26.336 --> 17:27.463
Well, you get it.

17:27.546 --> 17:31.383
Is this the gay kid
you were talking about, man?

17:31.467 --> 17:33.385
Yeah. He thinks he's in love
with his best friend.

17:33.469 --> 17:37.556
It would be kind of perfect, right?
We get along, his parents love me--

17:37.639 --> 17:41.727
Well, if he's gay and into it,
then you're making music.

17:41.810 --> 17:45.064
Beautiful music. Though,
I should figure out if Nick is into it.

17:45.147 --> 17:48.025
But if he's not,
that's a hard morning light

17:48.108 --> 17:50.402
coming through your window, brother.

17:50.486 --> 17:53.155
Joe Walsh is right.
If I come right out and tell him

17:53.238 --> 17:55.574
and he's not into it,
that could ruin everything.

17:55.657 --> 17:58.744
Yeah, and then you'll get caught up
in a bunch of lawsuits

17:58.827 --> 18:00.621
about publishing rights,

18:00.704 --> 18:04.875
and Don Henley doesn't call you
on your birthday anymore, man.

18:04.958 --> 18:07.669
It's a bummer
'cause he was your brother.

18:07.753 --> 18:09.171
[bell rings]

18:16.136 --> 18:18.013
-What's up, jerk?
-Hey, Jessi,

18:18.097 --> 18:22.184
-do you want to sit over here with me?
-Oh, yeah. Thanks, Missy.

18:22.267 --> 18:24.061
Do you want some of
my homemade fruit leather?

18:24.144 --> 18:27.856
-I'm not allowed refined sugar.
-Uh, thanks. I'm all set.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.274
Oh. Okay, how about this?

18:29.358 --> 18:32.319
Wow. It must be hard for you
that you can't sit with the boys anymore

18:32.402 --> 18:36.031
after all that stuff you said
about Nick's mouth.

18:36.115 --> 18:39.201
-Yeah.
-The gloves came off in a fit of rage.

18:39.284 --> 18:41.161
I was really mad.

18:41.245 --> 18:44.414
And I guess as goes Nick
so goes Andrew.

18:44.498 --> 18:47.084
It's the law of the jungle, Jessi.
It's the law of the jungle.

18:47.167 --> 18:49.795
Yeah, that part
I didn't really think through.

18:52.673 --> 18:55.050
Fucking bitch!
Eating those baby carrots

18:55.134 --> 18:57.886
when you know she wants to be eating
little pieces of shit.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.597
Jay, please.
How did everything get so messed up?

19:00.681 --> 19:03.684
I know. This whole thing with Jessi,
it makes you wonder,

19:03.767 --> 19:05.978
like, hey, women, do we even need them?

19:06.061 --> 19:09.690
What? Of course we do.
What about my mom and, like, whores?

19:09.773 --> 19:13.152
My point is, when it's just the boys
it's, hey, we make music.

19:13.235 --> 19:14.611
-Uh-huh.
-But with girls it's like,

19:14.695 --> 19:16.864
-"Aw, why aren't they boys?"
-I don't get it.

19:16.947 --> 19:18.657
Are you saying
that we can't be friends with girls?

19:18.740 --> 19:22.703
No, I'm just saying maybe the two of us
should go on a vacation,

19:22.786 --> 19:25.455
go camping or something,
get away from all this woman drama.

19:25.539 --> 19:28.792
-Oh, I love that. Camping's a great--
-It's just Nick and me!

19:28.876 --> 19:31.128
Oh-- yeah, no, that-- that's fine.

19:31.211 --> 19:33.630
I mean, I know how to track you guys.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.599
-[music playing]
-Nick-o-teen,

19:43.682 --> 19:46.768
you caught me working on a new song
that no one will ever hear.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.145
[laughing]

19:48.228 --> 19:52.024
Oh, death is so profoundly sad.

19:52.107 --> 19:54.443
But enough about me.
Why the long face?

19:54.526 --> 19:57.362
Duke, I guess I was wondering,
have you ever stayed friends with an ex?

19:57.446 --> 19:59.865
-Nope. Impossible.
-That's a bummer.

19:59.948 --> 20:01.700
I'd really like to be friends
with Jessi again.

20:01.783 --> 20:05.120
Man, you boys
having a lot of problems this week, huh?

20:05.204 --> 20:06.955
-What do you mean?
-Your lumpy friend Andrew

20:07.039 --> 20:08.457
was up here the other day.

20:08.540 --> 20:11.210
Good kid.
Thinks he might be a homosexual.

20:11.293 --> 20:13.503
What? Andrew? That's impossible.

20:13.587 --> 20:15.422
-He would tell me.
-Would he?

20:15.505 --> 20:18.091
What if he's shaking
in his little gay boots,

20:18.175 --> 20:20.385
scared you won't want to be
his friend anymore?

20:20.469 --> 20:23.305
I don't care if Andrew's gay,
I'll always want to be his friend.

20:23.388 --> 20:27.559
Let's just say he comes out to you
and you fire him from your band,

20:27.643 --> 20:31.813
so he becomes destitute and
flings himself in front of a trolley car.

20:31.897 --> 20:34.483
Duke, did you fire a guy for being gay?

20:34.566 --> 20:38.820
Oh, God, no! I loved having
gay guys in my band.

20:38.904 --> 20:41.406
More groupie for Dukie.
Yum, yum, yum!

20:41.490 --> 20:43.742
I would never fire Andrew from my band.

20:43.825 --> 20:45.494
Oh, my God, poor Andrew.

20:45.577 --> 20:49.248
"Oh, my God, poor Andrew"?
That sounds like a good song.

20:49.331 --> 20:51.792
I'm gonna change the "oh, my God"
to "hey, now"

20:51.875 --> 20:54.962
and "poor Andrew" to "sweet Desiree."

20:55.045 --> 20:58.006
♪ Hey now, sweet Desiree ♪

21:00.550 --> 21:02.010
-Hey.
-Hi.

21:02.094 --> 21:05.889
-What are you doing here?
-I spoke to Duke.

21:05.973 --> 21:09.476
Oh. Did he mention anything
about Stevie Wonder

21:09.559 --> 21:14.356
-and his connection to 9/11?
-No. We actually talked about you.

21:14.439 --> 21:17.192
-Oh, God.
-He said you think you might be gay.

21:17.276 --> 21:21.863
What the hell? Is there
no child-ghost confidentiality anymore?

21:21.947 --> 21:24.866
-Well, is it true?
-I don't know.

21:24.950 --> 21:28.537
Look, I got a boner
watching the  "PB:NYC"  trailer.

21:28.620 --> 21:31.665
Like, a big, hard boner.
And I don't know how to talk to girls

21:31.748 --> 21:34.334
but I wanna jizz all the time,

21:34.418 --> 21:37.838
and I'm so awkward around everyone
except you, 'cause we're best friends,

21:37.921 --> 21:40.924
and I guess it just seemed
like being gay might actually be great.

21:41.008 --> 21:44.094
But now that I'm saying it out loud
I don't know.

21:44.177 --> 21:46.888
I wish there was some way to know.
I've never even kissed a guy.

21:46.972 --> 21:49.599
I've never kissed anyone, for that matter.
How am I supposed to know if--

21:58.942 --> 22:00.569
You just kissed me.

22:00.652 --> 22:03.405
It was scientific.
I was just trying to help.

22:03.488 --> 22:04.823
Did you feel anything?

22:04.906 --> 22:07.034
-Uh...
-Nothing, flaccid.

22:07.117 --> 22:09.619
Maybe we should pin him to the ground,
jam it in his mouth,

22:09.703 --> 22:13.248
-just the sheer fucking degradation--
-Wait, wait, wait. Hush.

22:13.332 --> 22:17.377
-I-- I'm actually not into this.
-Yeah, no, I could tell.

22:17.461 --> 22:19.463
I was just spitballin'. Poof!

22:19.546 --> 22:21.923
So, are the test results in?

22:22.007 --> 22:24.676
Honestly, I didn't like it.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.553
Is it because
I have a gross catfish mouth?

22:26.636 --> 22:31.058
No, no, no, your mouth is fine.
I just didn't feel anything.

22:31.141 --> 22:32.517
Maybe I'm not gay.

22:32.601 --> 22:35.228
But thank you for kissing me...?

22:35.312 --> 22:37.147
Um, my pleasure...?

22:37.230 --> 22:39.775
Oh, I can't believe
that you were my first kiss.

22:39.858 --> 22:41.693
What am I gonna tell my grandkids?

22:41.777 --> 22:44.571
Grandpa Andrew, who was your first kiss?

22:44.654 --> 22:47.783
Well, you know your great-uncle Nick?

22:47.866 --> 22:51.119
You mean Nick Starr, the host
of "Countdown to Money"?

22:51.203 --> 22:53.955
Two robots and two humanoids
are here to compete

22:54.039 --> 22:56.958
for Most Glorious Kingdom of China
Bitcoin units.

22:57.042 --> 23:01.088
So sit tight or shake your booty
'cause it's time to...

23:01.171 --> 23:06.718
[contestants chanting]
"Countdown to Money with Nick Starr!"

23:06.802 --> 23:07.761
Ni hao!

23:09.346 --> 23:11.223
God, what's taking so long?

23:11.306 --> 23:13.558
Hey, man, hurry it up!
We're gonna miss the movie.

23:13.642 --> 23:17.145
Movie? I thought this was
the self-checkout at Walgreens.

23:17.229 --> 23:19.523
No wonder I couldn't find
prescription eye drops

23:19.606 --> 23:21.608
and those sticks you could floss with.

23:21.691 --> 23:23.902
-Oh, God, Jessi's here.
-What?

23:23.985 --> 23:26.905
-Come on, let's get out of here.
-No. You guys have to talk to each other.

23:26.988 --> 23:28.073
This is crazy.

23:28.865 --> 23:31.785
Oh, hello, Nick.
Did you bring a phone book to sit on?

23:31.868 --> 23:34.037
Oh, did you bring a big butt
that's yours?

23:34.121 --> 23:36.206
Hey! You two stop it.
This is ridiculous.

23:36.289 --> 23:38.708
You were friends,
then you're girlfriend and boyfriend,

23:38.792 --> 23:40.293
now you're not friends at all?

23:40.377 --> 23:43.296
Go stand by those two weird
Christmas movie posters

23:43.380 --> 23:46.466
and work your shit out.

23:46.967 --> 23:47.884
Maybe I  am  gay.

23:47.968 --> 23:51.096
-Okay, Andrew's not wrong.
-I know.

23:51.179 --> 23:53.306
When you said "let's be friends,"
I was excited

23:53.390 --> 23:55.600
because I really like being friends
with you.

23:55.684 --> 23:58.019
And we sucked
at being boyfriend and girlfriend.

23:58.103 --> 24:01.314
-Totally sucked at it.
-Are you sure we're not at Walgreens?

24:01.398 --> 24:04.109
I need to find the bin
filled with plastic balls

24:04.192 --> 24:05.610
that are too light to throw.

24:05.694 --> 24:08.530
I'm really sorry I said
all those terrible things about you.

24:08.613 --> 24:11.241
It's my fault.
I lied about how we broke up.

24:11.324 --> 24:13.493
I guess I just didn't want
to seem like the loser.

24:13.577 --> 24:15.495
We were both kind of losers.

24:15.579 --> 24:16.955
Yeah, we were.

24:17.038 --> 24:18.415
Shall we go to the movie?

24:18.498 --> 24:21.418
-After you, milady.
-Thank you, good sir.

24:23.211 --> 24:28.758
Aw, Atlanta Claus, you gotta help me find
a dying Mylar balloon that says "Wow."

24:28.842 --> 24:30.719
Merry Christ-murs!

24:30.802 --> 24:33.513
Have you been nar-ghty or nice?

24:33.597 --> 24:36.057
I can't be dishonest with you,
Black Santa.

24:36.141 --> 24:37.475
I've been real nar-ghty.

24:37.559 --> 24:40.770
I'm the one who put the fecal matter
on the basketballs.

24:40.854 --> 24:43.273
Hallelujer!

24:43.356 --> 24:48.278
Hey, Matthew, I just want to let you know
that I-- I figured it out.

24:48.361 --> 24:50.447
-I'm not gay.
-Oh!

24:50.530 --> 24:52.991
You had a whole little journey,
didn't you?

24:53.074 --> 24:57.287
Well, guess what, sack of potatoes?
No one is 100-percent gay or straight.

24:57.370 --> 25:00.457
-It's a spectrum.
-Oh. Well, how gay are you?

25:00.540 --> 25:03.293
I'm 20/20. Didn't Morrey
give you the gay test?

25:03.376 --> 25:05.879
"Morrey"? Do you mean
the Hormone Monster?

25:05.962 --> 25:08.924
Yeah, Morrey. He's the fucking man.

25:09.007 --> 25:10.884
And he's only a monster
when he does coke.

25:10.967 --> 25:12.761
Wow. Hmm. Well, that's--

25:12.844 --> 25:16.097
anyway, I guess I should be in less
of a hurry to figure everything out

25:16.181 --> 25:18.266
and just take each boner as it comes.

25:18.350 --> 25:19.976
[laughs] You're precious.

25:20.060 --> 25:23.104
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go watch  "PB:NYC,"

25:23.188 --> 25:26.858
which looks... super gay.

25:26.942 --> 25:28.235
Bye-ee!

Where do we go now, Paul Bunyan?

We're going to the Brambles
in Central Park.

Wait, what? Please tell me
there's a Walgreens

25:39.037 --> 25:41.122
in the gay part of Central Park.

25:41.206 --> 25:45.126
I really need a DVD of "Van Helsing"
and a six-foot-long receipt.

25:50.799 --> 25:53.802
Please tell me they put a Walgreens
in this Netflix.

25:53.885 --> 25:56.221
What are you guys gonna watch next?
Do you wanna hang out?

25:56.304 --> 25:58.473
You guys gonna watch another episode?
