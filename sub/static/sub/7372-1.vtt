04:04.286 --> 04:06.162
Very nearly there, sir.

04:07.164 --> 04:10.333
I have to say, your face is familiar.
Have I drawn you before?

04:10.417 --> 04:11.459
Occasionally.

04:11.543 --> 04:14.295
Of course! I've seen you in the newspaper.

04:14.379 --> 04:17.214
- You're a reporter?
- I'm a journalist.

04:18.050 --> 04:20.551
Be patient, Snowy, not much longer.

04:44.743 --> 04:46.911
I do beg your pardon.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.798
There.

04:58.882 --> 05:02.218
I believe I have captured something
of your likeness.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.637
Not bad!

05:05.222 --> 05:07.223
What do you think, Snowy?

05:08.976 --> 05:10.476
Snowy!

05:11.937 --> 05:13.479
There you are, sir.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.940
Now where's he run off to?

05:19.069 --> 05:20.277
Anything?

05:20.362 --> 05:21.570
Nothing.

05:26.410 --> 05:27.576
Snowy!

05:32.082 --> 05:34.500
Where have you been?

05:34.584 --> 05:36.335
Chasing cats again?

05:40.507 --> 05:42.758
Snowy, look at this!

05:56.273 --> 05:58.524
Triple masted.

05:58.608 --> 06:01.110
Double decks. Fifty guns.

06:02.237 --> 06:04.071
Isn't she a beauty?

06:04.156 --> 06:08.701
That's a very unique specimen, that is.
From an old sea captain's estate.

06:09.327 --> 06:10.369
"The Unicorn."

06:10.454 --> 06:13.039
Unicorn. Man o'war sailing ship.

06:13.123 --> 06:15.875
It's very old, that is. 16th century.

06:15.959 --> 06:17.251
17th, I would think.

06:17.335 --> 06:19.170
- Reign of Charles I.
- Charles II.

06:19.254 --> 06:23.049
That's what I said, Charles II.
As fine a ship as ever sailed the seven seas.

06:23.133 --> 06:24.884
You won't find another one of these, mate.

06:25.677 --> 06:27.344
And it's only two quid.

06:29.681 --> 06:32.016
- I'll give you a pound.
- Done!

06:36.396 --> 06:37.480
Gently does it.

06:38.482 --> 06:39.565
Excuse me!

06:39.649 --> 06:40.941
Here you go. Careful.

06:42.652 --> 06:44.737
Hey, bud, how much for the boat?

06:44.821 --> 06:46.947
I'm sorry, I just sold
it to this young gent.

06:47.032 --> 06:48.157
Oh, yeah?

06:48.492 --> 06:50.576
Tell me what you paid
and I'll give you double.

06:50.660 --> 06:53.913
- Double?
- Thanks. But it's not for sale.

06:53.997 --> 06:56.832
Look, kid, I'm trying to help you out.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.751
I don't think you realise this,

06:58.835 --> 07:01.170
but you're about to walk
into a whole mess of danger.

07:01.505 --> 07:02.713
What kind of danger?

07:04.049 --> 07:07.718
I'm warning you, get rid of the boat
and get out while you still can.

07:07.803 --> 07:10.262
These people do not play nice.

07:10.347 --> 07:11.514
What people?

07:11.598 --> 07:12.765
Wonderful!

07:13.850 --> 07:16.435
It's just wonderful.

07:16.520 --> 07:20.731
Don't bother wrapping it, I'll take it as is.
Does anybody object if I pay by cheque?

07:20.816 --> 07:23.984
If you want to buy it,
you'll have to talk to the kid.

07:24.069 --> 07:25.778
I see.

07:25.862 --> 07:29.073
Well, let the "kid" name his price.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.825
"Name his price"?

07:32.327 --> 07:33.953
Ten years I've been flogging bric-a-brac

07:34.037 --> 07:36.539
and I miss "name your price"
by one bleedin' minute!

07:36.623 --> 07:39.500
I'm sorry.
I already explained to the other gentleman.

07:39.584 --> 07:42.628
American he was. All hair oil and no socks.

07:42.712 --> 07:43.879
It's not for sale.

07:45.215 --> 07:48.467
Then let me appeal to your better nature.

07:48.552 --> 07:50.970
I have recently acquired Marlinspike Hall,

07:51.054 --> 07:55.141
and this ship, as I'm sure you're aware,
was once part of the estate.

07:55.225 --> 07:56.517
Of the late sea captain?

07:56.601 --> 07:59.812
The family fell upon hard times.
Lost everything.

07:59.896 --> 08:03.232
They've been living in a cloud
of bad luck ever since.

08:03.316 --> 08:07.987
We are talking generations of drinking
and irrational behaviour...

08:08.071 --> 08:09.446
I'm sorry.

08:09.531 --> 08:13.659
But as I told you before,
it's not for sale.

08:13.743 --> 08:15.119
Good day to you, sir.

08:19.583 --> 08:22.168
That young man, what's his name?

08:22.252 --> 08:25.796
Him? Everybody knows him. That's Tintin.

08:32.304 --> 08:34.429
What is it about this ship?

08:35.640 --> 08:38.350
Why has it attracted so much attention?

08:42.313 --> 08:44.315
What secrets do you hold?

08:53.074 --> 08:55.367
Where is that magnifying glass?

08:58.455 --> 09:00.664
I could have sworn it was...

09:08.840 --> 09:10.674
Where could it possibly be?

09:12.177 --> 09:13.260
Snowy, you haven't seen the...

09:15.472 --> 09:16.847
Where is it?

09:21.728 --> 09:22.978
Thank you.

09:25.649 --> 09:27.107
No, Snowy!

09:46.378 --> 09:48.045
Look what you did.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.422
You broke it!

09:50.924 --> 09:52.174
Bad dog!

10:01.017 --> 10:03.352
Something happened on this ship.

10:04.104 --> 10:07.606
And we're going to the one place
that could have the answer.

10:07.691 --> 10:09.233
Come on, Snowy.

10:31.381 --> 10:32.423
Here it is.

10:33.550 --> 10:38.095
"Sir Francis Haddock of Marlinspike Hall,
the last captain of the ill-fated Unicorn."

10:38.179 --> 10:40.639
"The ship set sail from Barbados in 1676"

10:40.724 --> 10:44.184
"on one of the most ruinous voyages
in maritime history."

10:44.269 --> 10:45.978
"Ship never reached destination."

10:46.187 --> 10:50.357
"Attacked by pirates,
all hands lost except for one survivor."

10:50.442 --> 10:52.985
"When Sir Francis was rescued
and returned home,"

10:53.069 --> 10:56.113
"he was convinced his name
had been cursed."

10:56.197 --> 10:57.573
"The Unicorn's manifest stated"

10:57.657 --> 11:00.242
"that it was carrying a cargo of rum
and tobacco bound for Europe,"

11:00.327 --> 11:04.663
"but it was long claimed
the ship was carrying a secret cargo."

11:06.249 --> 11:08.667
What was the ship carrying, Snowy?

11:10.754 --> 11:15.341
"Historians have tried and failed to
discover what happened on that fatal voyage,

11:15.425 --> 11:17.676
"but Sir Francis' last words,

11:18.928 --> 11:22.931
"'Only a true Haddock will discover
the secret of the Unicorn. "'

11:48.458 --> 11:50.459
I've missed something, Snowy.

11:51.461 --> 11:53.462
We need to take a closer
look at that model.

12:05.892 --> 12:07.976
Of course it's gone!

12:08.061 --> 12:10.062
How could I be so stupid?

12:32.627 --> 12:34.128
How'd you do that?

12:38.341 --> 12:39.675
Clever boy.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.278
A coat of arms.

12:59.946 --> 13:02.406
Why does that look familiar?

13:02.490 --> 13:04.116
Hang on a minute.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.660
That fish!

13:06.744 --> 13:08.287
It's a haddock.

13:08.621 --> 13:12.458
Of course!
Marlinspike Hall is the old Haddock estate.

13:14.210 --> 13:15.377
Snowy!

13:43.072 --> 13:44.656
Well done, Snowy!

13:44.741 --> 13:46.033
Good boy.

14:40.421 --> 14:42.089
Well, well, well.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.217
It seems we've caught our thief.

14:55.144 --> 14:57.729
Welcome to Marlinspike Hall.

14:57.814 --> 15:00.023
I see you let yourself in.

15:00.108 --> 15:02.276
I came to retrieve my property.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.903
I'm sorry, I'm not sure I follow you.

15:04.988 --> 15:06.405
I think you do.

15:06.489 --> 15:09.741
This ship was stolen from my apartment
less than an hour ago.

15:09.826 --> 15:12.494
I'm afraid you're mistaken, Mr Tintin.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.746
There's no mistake. It belongs to me.

15:14.831 --> 15:16.290
Are you sure?

15:18.376 --> 15:19.835
Of course I'm sure.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.296
I took it home,
I put it on a cabinet in the living room,

15:22.380 --> 15:25.716
and then Snowy chased the cat
and knocked it over, and it

15:26.467 --> 15:27.634
fell.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.388
This isn't my ship.

15:31.472 --> 15:33.140
No. Indeed.

15:34.559 --> 15:35.684
I'm sorry.

15:35.768 --> 15:39.187
- It looks identical.
- Well, looks can be deceiving.

15:39.272 --> 15:42.274
Yes, indeed. But I don't understand!

15:43.318 --> 15:46.778
Why did Sir Francis make two ships
exactly alike?

15:46.863 --> 15:50.324
And you have one already.
Why do you want another?

15:51.367 --> 15:54.328
What is it about this model
that would cause someone to steal it?

15:54.412 --> 15:58.040
Goodness me, why so many questions?

15:58.124 --> 15:59.458
It's my job.

15:59.542 --> 16:02.502
There could be a story here.
That's what I do, you see.

16:02.587 --> 16:04.129
Well, it's no great mystery.

16:04.213 --> 16:07.132
Sir Francis Haddock was a drunkard
and a hopeless reprobate.

16:07.216 --> 16:11.762
He was doomed to fail,
and he bequeathed that failure to his sons.

16:12.513 --> 16:15.932
So it's true! The Haddock line is cursed.

16:17.810 --> 16:21.188
- What else have you found out?
- What is there to find?

16:22.565 --> 16:24.399
That depends what you're looking for.

16:24.525 --> 16:27.903
I'm looking for answers, Mr Sakharine.

16:28.071 --> 16:30.489
You're looking in the wrong place.

16:31.282 --> 16:33.075
It's late.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.160
I think you should go home.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.745
This way, sir.

16:52.136 --> 16:53.512
It's a pity, sir.

16:54.430 --> 16:55.430
I'm sorry?

16:55.598 --> 16:57.933
That the mast broke on
your model ship, sir.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.769
I hope you found all the pieces.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.396
Things are so easily lost.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.940
Nestor! Where are you?

17:05.650 --> 17:07.275
Good night, sir.

17:11.614 --> 17:13.740
Some things are easily lost.

17:15.326 --> 17:17.661
What did he mean by that, Snowy?

17:17.744 --> 17:20.372
What was he trying to tell me?

17:20.455 --> 17:22.624
Some things are easily lost.

17:29.674 --> 17:30.841
Snowy!

17:36.973 --> 17:38.432
Great snakes!

17:45.648 --> 17:47.315
What is it, Snowy?

18:05.501 --> 18:06.877
What's this?

18:08.963 --> 18:10.756
This was in the mast!

18:17.764 --> 18:19.347
Good boy, Snowy.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.812
"Three brothers joined."

18:25.897 --> 18:28.482
"Three Unicorns in company"

18:28.775 --> 18:31.693
"sailing in the noonday sun will speak."

18:32.028 --> 18:35.572
"For 'tis from the light
that light will dawn."

18:35.656 --> 18:38.492
"And then shines forth the Eagle's Cross."

18:41.245 --> 18:42.996
What are these markings?

18:43.206 --> 18:46.792
Some kind of secret language or code?

18:46.918 --> 18:48.960
It makes no sense.

18:49.045 --> 18:51.630
But it does explain
why they ransacked the flat.

18:51.714 --> 18:54.466
They were looking for this,
and they didn't find it.

18:54.926 --> 18:56.343
Which means

18:58.429 --> 18:59.679
they'll be back.

19:01.182 --> 19:04.392
No, I don't know where he is, dearie.
I think he's gone out.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.311
And anyway, it's after dark,

19:06.395 --> 19:11.316
and Mr Tintin is most particular
about not admitting visitors after bedtime.

19:11.901 --> 19:13.944
I have to go back to my cocoa.

19:14.070 --> 19:17.072
I've got a very good
book and a cup of cocoa.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.990
It's really lovely!

19:19.075 --> 19:22.077
Thank you, Mrs Finch.
I can look after this.

19:25.331 --> 19:28.667
Hey, kid, is that you? Open the door.

19:29.377 --> 19:30.460
What do you want?

19:30.545 --> 19:34.297
Look, the game is up. He's gonna be back.

19:34.382 --> 19:36.842
Now, I know he wanted those boats,
but I swear to God,

19:36.926 --> 19:38.760
I never thought he'd kill anyone over it!

19:38.886 --> 19:41.346
Who? Who are you talking about?

19:41.430 --> 19:43.890
I'm trying to tell you
that your life is in danger.

19:43.975 --> 19:44.975
Answer me! Who?

20:05.454 --> 20:09.374
Mrs Finch!
A man's been shot on our doorstep!

20:09.458 --> 20:12.002
- Not again.
- Call an ambulance!

20:15.548 --> 20:16.882
No, Snowy!

20:30.730 --> 20:32.147
Can you hear me?

20:32.231 --> 20:33.565
Can you...

20:42.783 --> 20:45.368
The victim's name was Barnaby Dawes.

20:45.453 --> 20:47.913
He was one of the top agents at Interpol,

20:47.997 --> 20:50.081
but we haven't got a clue
what he was working on.

20:50.166 --> 20:52.792
Quite right, Thompson.
We're completely clueless.

20:52.877 --> 20:54.502
Interpol doesn't have any other leads?

20:54.587 --> 20:57.172
Steady on, Tintin.
We're still filling out the paperwork.

20:57.256 --> 21:00.800
Police work's not all glamour and guns.
There's an awful lot of filing.

21:00.885 --> 21:02.385
Well, I might have something for you.

21:02.470 --> 21:04.930
Before he lost consciousness,
Dawes tried to tell me something,

21:05.014 --> 21:07.015
and I think he was spelling out a word.

21:07.141 --> 21:09.142
"...B- O-U"

21:09.769 --> 21:12.437
"D-J-A-N."

21:14.774 --> 21:16.149
"Karaboudjan."

21:16.233 --> 21:17.651
Karaboudjan!

21:18.319 --> 21:19.486
Does that mean anything to you?

21:19.570 --> 21:21.780
Great Scotland Yard! That's extraordinary!

21:21.864 --> 21:22.864
What is?

21:22.949 --> 21:25.325
Worthington's have a half-price sale
on bowler hats!

21:25.409 --> 21:28.244
Really, Thomson! This is hardly the time.

21:28.329 --> 21:30.330
- Great Scotland Yard!
- What is it?

21:30.414 --> 21:31.456
Canes are half-price, too!

21:31.540 --> 21:33.124
Are you going to take charge
of this evidence?

21:33.209 --> 21:34.376
Positively.

21:34.460 --> 21:37.629
Never fear, Tintin,
the evidence is safe with us!

21:39.131 --> 21:41.216
Thomson? Where are you?

21:41.342 --> 21:44.594
Well, I'm already downstairs.
Do try to keep up.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.723
Wait! You dropped this.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.643
Good heavens, Thomson!
Look after the evidence, man.

21:51.727 --> 21:54.145
Sorry, Thompson.
My mind is on other things.

21:54.230 --> 21:57.065
Yes. Our light-fingered larcenist.

21:57.566 --> 21:58.942
- What?
- The pickpocket.

21:59.026 --> 22:01.569
He has no idea what's coming.

22:01.654 --> 22:04.322
Go on, Tintin, take my wallet.

22:07.743 --> 22:10.328
Yes, industrial strength elastic.

22:10.413 --> 22:12.163
Very resourceful.

22:12.248 --> 22:16.001
On the contrary. It was childishly simple.

22:16.085 --> 22:17.836
Simply childish, I agree.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.004
- Tintin.
- Tintin.

22:19.088 --> 22:20.422
Gentlemen.

22:22.008 --> 22:24.509
Mind you, I expect he's miles away by now.

22:24.593 --> 22:26.553
I presume you're referring
to the pickpocket?

22:26.637 --> 22:30.098
Yes. I mean,
knowing we're just a few steps behind him.

22:30.766 --> 22:33.435
Snowy, what is it, boy? What do you see?

22:33.519 --> 22:35.353
I don't suppose you'd fancy a cup of tea?

22:35.438 --> 22:37.605
You're quite mistaken. I'd love one.

22:37.815 --> 22:39.107
My treat.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.403
- I've got you now!
- You devil!

22:43.487 --> 22:45.947
Stop, in the name of the law!

22:47.616 --> 22:48.700
Got you!

22:52.621 --> 22:54.706
What's going on down there?

22:54.790 --> 22:55.915
Come on, Snowy!

22:57.668 --> 23:00.045
- I do beg your pardon.
- Sorry, sir!

23:00.129 --> 23:03.715
The pickpocket, Tintin! He's getting away!

23:03.799 --> 23:05.842
My wallet!

23:05.926 --> 23:07.260
It's gone!

23:09.889 --> 23:12.223
Come on! Snowy, after him!

23:12.308 --> 23:13.683
Stop! Wait!

23:26.655 --> 23:29.365
- Got you!
- Steady on.

23:29.450 --> 23:31.493
I've lost him!

23:31.577 --> 23:34.579
You must find my wallet.
It's very important. I have to get it back.

23:34.663 --> 23:38.208
And you will.
Leave it to the professionals.

23:40.002 --> 23:41.836
We've lost the scroll.

23:41.921 --> 23:44.255
But we haven't lost the story.

23:44.340 --> 23:45.840
"Karaboudjan."

23:45.925 --> 23:48.093
It's an Armenian word.
That's our lead, Snowy.

23:48.177 --> 23:51.304
What was Barnaby Dawes trying to tell us
when he said our lives were in danger?

23:51.388 --> 23:53.848
- Mr Tin... Tin?
- Yes.

23:53.933 --> 23:56.434
- Delivery for you.
- But I didn't order anything.

23:56.519 --> 23:59.979
Well, that's because it's you
that's getting delivered!

24:03.359 --> 24:05.401
Quick, get him in the van!

24:08.030 --> 24:10.532
Get off me, you confounded mutt!

24:11.534 --> 24:13.118
He bit me!

24:13.202 --> 24:14.369
Quick!

24:43.566 --> 24:44.983
Get him off!

24:46.861 --> 24:49.070
Shake him off, then run him over!

25:34.116 --> 25:36.159
I want this on the starboard side!

25:43.709 --> 25:45.710
Not here. Look your side.

25:45.794 --> 25:47.045
Hang on.

25:47.129 --> 25:48.713
- Nothing.
- Well, check that pocket, Tom.

25:48.797 --> 25:50.715
No, I've looked in this one already,
I'm sure of it.

25:50.799 --> 25:51.966
Well, have a look in his socks.

25:54.887 --> 25:56.971
- Have you found it?
- He doesn't have it.

25:57.056 --> 25:58.348
It's not on him, boss. It's not here.

25:58.432 --> 26:00.767
- Not here? Then where is it?
- Where's what?

26:01.644 --> 26:04.979
I am tired of your games.
The scroll, from the Unicorn.

26:05.105 --> 26:08.191
A piece of paper like this!

26:08.275 --> 26:09.817
You mean the poem?

26:10.527 --> 26:12.195
Yes.

26:12.279 --> 26:15.740
- The poem written in Old English.
- Yes.

26:15.824 --> 26:18.117
- It was inside a cylinder.
- Yes.

26:18.202 --> 26:20.662
- Concealed in the mast.
- Yes!

26:22.122 --> 26:23.164
I don't have it.

26:25.501 --> 26:29.963
You know the value of that scroll.
Why else would you take it?

26:30.047 --> 26:33.925
Two ships and two scrolls,
both part of a puzzle.

26:34.009 --> 26:36.719
You have one, you need the other.

26:36.804 --> 26:40.139
But that's not it. There's something else.

26:41.225 --> 26:45.061
I will find it, with or without your help.

26:46.730 --> 26:49.983
You need to think about
exactly how useful you are to me.

26:54.530 --> 26:57.073
- We'll deal with him on the way.
- Aye-aye, sir.

26:57.157 --> 26:58.783
Hold this course.

27:05.874 --> 27:07.041
Snowy!

27:08.711 --> 27:12.213
It's good to see you, too.
See if you can chew through these ropes.

27:16.969 --> 27:21.055
He's lying! He must have the scroll.
The question is, what has he done with it?

27:21.140 --> 27:22.890
We searched him all over, boss.

27:22.975 --> 27:25.727
I want you to go back down there
and make him talk.

27:25.811 --> 27:28.604
Break every bone in his
body if you have to!

27:28.689 --> 27:29.772
That's nasty.

27:29.857 --> 27:32.817
You know the stakes.
You know what we're playing for. Just do it!

27:32.901 --> 27:35.987
Mr Sakharine! Mr Sakharine!
All hell has broken loose!

27:36.071 --> 27:38.114
It's a disaster!
The captain has come around.

27:38.198 --> 27:39.824
- What?
- He's conscious.

27:39.908 --> 27:41.784
He's accusing you of mutiny.

27:41.869 --> 27:45.413
- He says you turned the crew against him.
- Sounds like he's sobered up again.

27:45.497 --> 27:48.082
Well, don't just stand there.
Get him another bottle.

27:48.709 --> 27:49.751
Aye, sir!

27:59.261 --> 28:00.470
Okay.

28:18.280 --> 28:19.864
- Jiggle it a bit, it's just stuck.
- Jiggle?

28:19.948 --> 28:21.115
Here.

28:23.077 --> 28:25.953
What are you doing? Get off!

28:26.038 --> 28:29.332
It's not stuck, you idiot.
He's bolted it from the inside!

28:29.416 --> 28:32.085
So you want to play like that then,
do you, Tintin?

28:32.169 --> 28:33.586
Get the TNT.

28:35.005 --> 28:38.424
Broken crates. Rope. Champagne.

28:39.593 --> 28:40.802
What else do we have, Snowy?

28:41.470 --> 28:43.971
There are other ways to open this door.

28:44.681 --> 28:47.517
They'll be swabbing the decks
with your innards when we're done with you.

28:52.481 --> 28:54.023
Give it here.

29:18.674 --> 29:20.466
- Don't move.
- What...

29:26.473 --> 29:27.807
Let's go!

29:28.600 --> 29:30.309
Let me have him!

29:30.394 --> 29:32.478
He's got a big shooter!

29:32.855 --> 29:34.188
He got me!

29:39.027 --> 29:40.403
Hold your fire.

29:47.536 --> 29:50.037
He ain't here. He's vanished.

29:52.207 --> 29:53.416
He's hiding.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.710
Search the ship. Quickly!

30:07.139 --> 30:09.474
A giant rat of Sumatra!

30:11.643 --> 30:13.561
So, you thought you could
sneak in behind me

30:13.645 --> 30:16.314
and catch me with my trousers down, huh?

30:16.398 --> 30:18.483
I'd rather you kept your trousers on,
if it's all the same to you.

30:18.567 --> 30:21.527
- I know your game. You're one of them.
- Sorry?

30:21.612 --> 30:24.280
- They sent you here to kill me, huh?
- Look, I don't know who you are!

30:24.364 --> 30:26.115
That's how he's planned to bump me off.

30:26.700 --> 30:29.577
Murdered in my bed
by a baby-faced assassin!

30:31.246 --> 30:33.414
Assassin? Look, you've got it all wrong.

30:33.499 --> 30:36.000
I was kidnapped by a gang of thugs.

30:37.961 --> 30:39.795
The filthy swine.

30:40.714 --> 30:42.965
He's turned the whole crew against me!

30:43.050 --> 30:44.300
Who?

30:44.384 --> 30:46.636
A sour-faced man with a sugary name.

30:46.720 --> 30:49.514
He's bought them all off, every last man.

30:49.598 --> 30:50.681
Sakharine!

30:51.391 --> 30:55.019
Nobody takes my ship!

30:55.103 --> 30:56.145
You're the captain?

30:56.230 --> 30:59.440
Of course I'm the captain.
Who else could I be?

30:59.525 --> 31:02.818
I've been locked in this room for days

31:02.903 --> 31:07.740
with only whisky to sustain my mortal soul.

31:13.789 --> 31:15.414
Well, I assumed it was locked.

31:15.582 --> 31:16.999
Well, it's not.

31:17.084 --> 31:20.169
Now, you must excuse me.
If they find me here, they'll kill me.

31:20.254 --> 31:24.382
I have to keep moving.
Try and find my way off this drunken tub.

31:24.466 --> 31:26.217
"Tub"? Tub?

31:31.515 --> 31:33.115
Tub?

31:41.108 --> 31:42.775
- Thanks.
- Pleasure.

31:44.778 --> 31:46.237
I'm Tintin, by the way.

31:46.321 --> 31:48.614
Haddock. Archibald Haddock.

31:48.699 --> 31:51.033
There's a longboat up on deck. Follow me.

31:51.118 --> 31:52.451
Hang on a second.

31:52.536 --> 31:53.869
Did you say "Haddock"?

31:54.871 --> 31:56.956
How could you let them escape?

31:57.040 --> 31:59.542
Find them. Find them both.

31:59.626 --> 32:02.044
- Don't worry, we'll kill them, sir.
- No.

32:02.129 --> 32:04.755
You can kill the boy. Not Haddock.

32:04.840 --> 32:07.091
What? He's just a hopeless old soak.

32:07.175 --> 32:09.385
We should've killed him long since.

32:09.469 --> 32:14.307
You think it's an accident that I
chose Haddock's ship, Haddock's crew,

32:14.391 --> 32:17.018
Haddock's treacherous first mate?

32:17.853 --> 32:20.104
Nothing is an accident.

32:26.278 --> 32:29.947
We go back a long way,
Captain Haddock and I.

32:30.032 --> 32:32.908
We've unfinished business.

32:32.993 --> 32:37.121
And this time, I'm going to make him pay.

32:38.081 --> 32:42.251
We have to reach a locked door at the end
of this corridor. This is gonna be tricky.

32:42.336 --> 32:43.628
You wouldn't happen to be related

32:43.712 --> 32:45.504
to the Haddocks of Marlinspike Hall,
would you?

32:45.964 --> 32:46.964
Why do you ask?

32:47.049 --> 32:48.507
It's for a story I've been working on.

32:48.592 --> 32:51.260
An old shipwreck that happened
off the coast of Barbados.

32:51.345 --> 32:54.096
A man o'war. Triple masted. Fifty guns.

32:56.683 --> 33:00.728
- What do you know of the Unicorn?
- Not a lot. That's why I'm asking you.

33:00.812 --> 33:04.273
The secret of that ship
is known only to my family!

33:04.358 --> 33:07.318
It's been passed down
from generation to generation.

33:07.402 --> 33:12.239
My granddaddy himself,
with his dying breath, told me the tale.

33:13.075 --> 33:14.200
And?

33:14.910 --> 33:16.035
Gone.

33:16.870 --> 33:17.995
What do you mean, gone?

33:18.080 --> 33:21.499
I was so upset when he kicked the bucket,
I had no choice but to drown my sorrows.

33:21.583 --> 33:25.127
When I woke up in the morning, it was gone!
I'd forgotten it all.

33:25.212 --> 33:26.962
- Everything?
- Every last word.

33:27.047 --> 33:30.132
Well, is there somebody else in your family?
Maybe they would know.

33:30.217 --> 33:33.469
Sir Francis had three sons.
All but my bloodline failed.

33:33.553 --> 33:36.681
I am the last of the Haddocks!

33:36.765 --> 33:38.432
Did you say three sons?

33:39.017 --> 33:40.476
Let's check below!

33:40.936 --> 33:43.354
There is a bottle of rum for the man
who finds Haddock.

33:43.438 --> 33:46.357
And kill the boy. Hope I find him first.

33:46.441 --> 33:47.858
What's that?

33:48.652 --> 33:50.027
You're hearing things.

33:50.112 --> 33:51.445
Quiet, Ali.

33:54.032 --> 33:55.533
There's nothing there.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.284
Let's go up.

33:58.286 --> 33:59.870
I know what Sakharine's looking for.

33:59.955 --> 34:03.708
- What are you raving on about?
- It was written on the scroll.

34:03.792 --> 34:05.668
"Three brothers joined."

34:05.794 --> 34:09.170
"Three Unicorns in company
sailing in the noonday sun will speak."

34:09.255 --> 34:10.297
Really?

34:10.632 --> 34:13.926
Sir Francis didn't make two models
of the Unicorn.

34:14.010 --> 34:15.219
He made three!

34:15.762 --> 34:18.931
Three ships for three sons.

34:19.014 --> 34:20.141
Excellent!

34:22.143 --> 34:24.853
Sakharine's after the third model ship.

34:26.481 --> 34:28.690
Barnacles! Someone's locked the door!

34:28.775 --> 34:30.985
- Well, is there a key?
- A key?

34:34.114 --> 34:37.158
Yes, now, that would be the problem.

34:42.831 --> 34:43.956
Mr Jaggerman!

34:44.498 --> 34:47.710
Top bunk in the centre. Keeper of the keys.

34:47.793 --> 34:52.547
Careful, mind. He's a restless sleeper on
account of the tragic loss of his eyelids.

34:52.632 --> 34:54.425
- He lost his eyelids?
- Aye.

34:54.509 --> 34:57.344
Now, that was a card game to remember.

34:58.013 --> 35:00.723
You really had to be there.

35:00.807 --> 35:02.183
I'd do this myself, Tintin,

35:02.267 --> 35:05.936
but you've a lighter tread
and less chance of waking the boys.

35:06.021 --> 35:10.065
- Are you sure this is a good idea?
- You've nothing to worry about.

35:10.317 --> 35:12.359
Provided they all stay asleep.

35:13.195 --> 35:15.529
I wouldn't get too close to Mr Hobbs.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.865
He's very handy with a razor.

35:20.786 --> 35:23.954
And I'd steer clear of Mr Gitch.

35:26.792 --> 35:30.878
Sacked as a shepherd
on account of his "animal husbandry."

35:58.073 --> 35:59.657
Not the sandwich.

35:59.741 --> 36:01.033
The keys!

36:20.720 --> 36:22.555
You're a brave lad, Tintin.

36:22.681 --> 36:25.224
My heart was in my mouth,
I don't mind telling you.

36:25.308 --> 36:29.562
Well, that is, if it was my heart.

36:29.646 --> 36:31.480
Judging by my stomach,
it could've been anything, really.

36:31.565 --> 36:33.607
Hurry up, Captain! We've no time to lose.

36:34.109 --> 36:35.609
Bingo!

36:36.361 --> 36:37.903
Just the necessities, of course.

36:44.953 --> 36:46.579
To the lifeboats.

36:47.163 --> 36:48.539
Ease it in!

36:51.042 --> 36:52.209
Put your back into it!

36:52.294 --> 36:54.420
Hold her there, steady!

36:54.504 --> 36:55.838
Any sign of him, Jumbo?

36:55.964 --> 36:59.800
Nothing yet. Watch yourself.
The boss says he's a handful.

37:11.646 --> 37:12.897
Come on.

37:33.126 --> 37:34.543
It's Allan.

37:34.628 --> 37:38.589
- Is that the bridge?
- Aye, on the other side of the radio room.

37:38.673 --> 37:40.549
Radio room?

37:40.634 --> 37:43.761
Wait here, Captain.
Sound the alarm if anyone comes.

37:43.845 --> 37:45.471
Careful, Tintin.

37:47.849 --> 37:49.141
I can't see a thing!

37:49.225 --> 37:52.102
Quit your whining and find the kid!

37:52.187 --> 37:53.896
I didn't sign on for this!

37:53.980 --> 37:55.230
Keep searching!

37:55.607 --> 37:57.900
- Message just come through, boss.
- What's it say?

37:57.984 --> 38:03.238
"The Milanese Nightingale has landed.
Waiting in the wings for action."

38:03.323 --> 38:05.157
"Milanese Nightingale"?

38:05.241 --> 38:07.076
Now pray this cheers him up.

38:23.551 --> 38:24.802
"Bagghar."

38:26.221 --> 38:27.388
What's this?

38:28.181 --> 38:30.307
"The Sultanate of Bagghar"

38:32.894 --> 38:35.396
"ruled over by Sheikh Omar Ben Salaad,"

38:35.897 --> 38:39.692
"whose love of music and culture
is matched only by his love of..."

38:42.070 --> 38:43.070
Great snakes!

38:48.910 --> 38:50.119
Bagghar.

38:52.914 --> 38:55.165
The Port of Bagghar.

38:55.250 --> 38:56.583
Morocco.

39:04.843 --> 39:06.176
Tintin!

39:08.555 --> 39:10.639
Hey! Put your hands up!

39:15.103 --> 39:17.062
And let that be a lesson to you!

39:17.856 --> 39:19.273
Help me!

39:28.950 --> 39:30.409
In here! He's in here!

39:35.248 --> 39:36.749
Here! By the lifeboats!

39:36.833 --> 39:38.333
Out of the way!

39:38.418 --> 39:40.294
After him! Get him!

39:48.053 --> 39:50.012
Quick, quick, in here!

39:54.768 --> 39:56.060
Over there!

39:56.811 --> 39:58.479
Why, you little...

40:17.707 --> 40:19.583
- He's up there!
- Go!

40:24.214 --> 40:26.006
I can see him now!

40:32.514 --> 40:33.680
Don't let them get away!

40:38.269 --> 40:39.728
Help me!

40:46.194 --> 40:47.778
- Turn this ship around!
- Aye, sir!

40:47.862 --> 40:49.404
Get me a flare!

40:55.328 --> 40:57.454
Captain, get down! Get down!

41:00.375 --> 41:02.751
- There he is!
- Get out of the way!

41:07.090 --> 41:09.716
Now! Full ahead! Full speed!

41:15.557 --> 41:17.099
Got you now.

41:18.309 --> 41:19.852
Stay down.

41:31.030 --> 41:32.072
Look! Down there!

41:44.919 --> 41:47.546
Idiots! You idiots! What have you done?

41:47.630 --> 41:49.756
We killed them, boss, like you wanted!

41:49.841 --> 41:54.386
No! Not like I wanted!
I needed Haddock alive!

41:54.470 --> 41:57.598
Wait a minute, boss!
There are two boats missing!

41:57.932 --> 42:00.642
So, that one must have been a decoy.

42:09.068 --> 42:12.321
They're onto us, and our destination.

42:12.405 --> 42:16.783
Find them! Make absolutely certain
they never reach Bagghar!

42:17.160 --> 42:19.995
Yes, boss.

42:22.373 --> 42:25.209
Get up there!

42:32.717 --> 42:34.593
We have to get to Bagghar
ahead of Sakharine.

42:34.677 --> 42:36.220
I know. I know.

42:37.013 --> 42:38.096
Why?

42:38.306 --> 42:40.557
Because he has the third model ship.

42:40.642 --> 42:42.267
How do you know?

42:43.228 --> 42:46.313
The Sheikh collects old ships. And this

42:46.981 --> 42:49.316
is the prize of his collection.

42:50.735 --> 42:53.904
Blistering blue barnacles,
that is the Unicorn!

42:53.988 --> 42:55.906
Captain, do you see the distortion
around the model?

42:55.990 --> 42:57.032
Aye.

42:57.116 --> 43:01.119
It means that Ben Salaad exhibits it
in a bulletproof glass case in his palace.

43:01.204 --> 43:03.914
And Sakharine is going there to steal it!

43:03.998 --> 43:06.583
Yes, he has a secret weapon.
The Milanese Nightingale.

43:06.668 --> 43:08.210
But that won't be enough
to solve the mystery,

43:08.294 --> 43:11.630
and that is why Sakharine needs you.

43:11.714 --> 43:13.048
That's why he made you his prisoner.

43:13.383 --> 43:16.301
There is something
he needs you to remember.

43:18.304 --> 43:19.721
I don't follow you.

43:21.224 --> 43:22.516
I read it in a book.

43:23.518 --> 43:27.145
That only a true Haddock
can discover the secret of the Unicorn.

43:33.069 --> 43:34.945
I don't remember anything about anything.

43:35.029 --> 43:37.864
But you must know about your ancestors,
Sir Francis. It's your family legacy!

43:37.949 --> 43:39.366
My memory is not what it used to be.

43:39.450 --> 43:42.160
- Well, what did it used to be?
- I've forgotten.

43:43.621 --> 43:44.663
Captain,

43:45.581 --> 43:46.832
can you get us to Bagghar?

43:47.875 --> 43:50.752
What sort of a stupid question is that?

43:51.546 --> 43:55.632
Give me those oars!
I'll show you some real seamanship, laddie.

43:55.717 --> 44:01.430
I'll not be doubted by some pipsqueak tuft
of ginger and his irritating dog!

44:01.514 --> 44:05.559
I am master and commander of the seas!

44:07.228 --> 44:11.064
I know these waters better than the warts
on my mother's face!

44:13.568 --> 44:16.320
Look at the pair of them. Fast asleep.

44:16.863 --> 44:20.824
Typical landlubbers.
Aye, no stamina these days.

44:20.908 --> 44:24.536
Never mind. I'll get you there, Tintin.

44:41.095 --> 44:43.263
Look, Thomson. There's the fellow.

44:45.224 --> 44:46.391
Oh, my.

44:56.402 --> 44:58.862
- Mr Silk?
- Yes?

44:58.946 --> 45:01.156
- My name is Thompson.
- And Thomson.

45:01.240 --> 45:03.158
- We're police officers!
- We're police officers!

45:04.952 --> 45:06.328
Oh, crumbs.

45:08.706 --> 45:10.082
Good gracious!

45:10.166 --> 45:11.458
- Mr Silk!
- Mr Silk!

45:11.542 --> 45:13.210
- Dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.
- Are you okay?

45:13.294 --> 45:14.669
Poor fellow!

45:17.006 --> 45:19.007
- Are you all right?
- Are you all right, sir?

45:19.092 --> 45:21.635
- Here, let me help you up.
- Thank you, that's very kind.

45:21.719 --> 45:24.054
- No need to run away, sir.
- No, no, you see,

45:24.138 --> 45:27.557
yesterday we very nearly caught the
pickpocket who's been terrorising the town!

45:27.642 --> 45:28.642
Pickpocket?

45:28.726 --> 45:32.020
We pulled his jacket off
and inside we found a wallet.

45:32.105 --> 45:33.980
A wallet with your name and address!

45:34.065 --> 45:36.233
- That's my wallet.
- Well, it's obvious he stole it from you.

45:36.317 --> 45:38.318
- No, no, that's my wallet.
- Are you all right, sir?

45:38.403 --> 45:40.987
We didn't mean to startle you.
Let us help you into your apartment.

45:41.489 --> 45:44.533
Thank you so much. No need to come in.
I'll be quite all right, really.

45:44.617 --> 45:47.244
- No, we insist.
- Better safe than sorry.

45:47.328 --> 45:49.621
- It's the least we can do.
- Thank you.

45:49.705 --> 45:51.164
There we are.

45:52.166 --> 45:54.209
Good grief! What's all this?

45:54.293 --> 45:56.336
It's my collection?

45:56.838 --> 45:59.714
- What a lot of wallets!
- I can't help it.

45:59.799 --> 46:03.844
It started with coin purses
and sort of went on from there, really.

46:03.928 --> 46:07.180
You want to be careful. Haven't you heard?
There's a pickpocket about.

46:07.265 --> 46:11.017
- Yes, he'd love this. Can you imagine?
- What do you mean, "pickpocket"?

46:11.102 --> 46:12.561
A master criminal.

46:12.645 --> 46:16.314
A bag-snatching, purse-pilfering,
wallet-lifting sneak thief!

46:16.399 --> 46:17.983
I'm not a bad person.

46:18.818 --> 46:20.569
I'm a kleptomaniac.

46:21.195 --> 46:23.822
- A what?
- It's a fear of open spaces.

46:24.115 --> 46:26.950
Poor man. No wonder he keeps his wallets
in the living room.

46:27.034 --> 46:30.787
Wallets. I just can't resist
the lovely little things.

46:30.872 --> 46:33.540
It's a harmless little habit, really.

46:33.624 --> 46:36.877
Good heavens, Thomson, look at this!
His name's Thompson, too.

46:36.961 --> 46:38.003
What a coincidence.

46:38.087 --> 46:40.797
No, Thomson, this is Thomson without a "P,"
as in "psychic."

46:40.882 --> 46:44.009
No, no, no, it's Thompson with a "P,"
as in "psychologist."

46:44.093 --> 46:46.428
Look at this one!
A green one that I managed to pick

46:46.512 --> 46:48.805
from a pickpocket
actually pickpocketing at the time.

46:48.890 --> 46:50.599
- And this one! Cuir de cochon.
- No, you have it all wrong.

46:50.683 --> 46:53.643
- There is a "P" in "psychic."
- I am not your sidekick! You are mine!

46:53.728 --> 46:56.313
- Smell it, won't you? Piggy leather!
- No, you have it all wrong.

46:56.397 --> 46:58.064
- How dare you!
- How dare you!

46:58.399 --> 47:00.108
- I met you first.
- I met you first.

47:00.193 --> 47:01.193
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

47:01.277 --> 47:02.319
- No, you did not.
- Yes, I did.

47:02.403 --> 47:03.445
- Didn't!
- Did!

47:03.529 --> 47:05.864
- Listen! I can't stand it any more!
- Hey!

47:05.948 --> 47:08.116
All right, I'll come quietly.

47:08.201 --> 47:10.660
Take them! Take them! Take them all!

47:10.745 --> 47:12.829
Stop it. Pull yourself together, man!

47:12.914 --> 47:15.415
We can't take your wallets!
Do we look like thieves?

47:15.750 --> 47:17.667
Good heavens, Thompson.

47:18.127 --> 47:19.628
This looks familiar.

47:19.712 --> 47:21.046
Can't be.

47:21.756 --> 47:22.923
It is!

47:23.341 --> 47:24.382
- Tintin!
- Tintin!

47:33.309 --> 47:36.019
I'm so cold.

47:36.103 --> 47:37.604
And thirsty.

47:40.816 --> 47:42.692
My throat is parched.

47:42.777 --> 47:44.778
Let's see if there's any fresh water.

47:52.954 --> 47:55.455
What have we here?

47:59.835 --> 48:02.879
Tintin.

48:03.798 --> 48:05.423
Come and warm yourself, laddie.

48:06.050 --> 48:07.300
Captain?

48:08.261 --> 48:10.887
- What have you done?
- No need to thank me.

48:10.972 --> 48:12.097
What?

48:12.181 --> 48:15.976
Well, you looked a little cold,
so I lit a wee fire.

48:16.060 --> 48:17.143
In a boat?

48:17.228 --> 48:19.563
No! Those are our oars! We need those oars!

48:19.647 --> 48:21.356
Yes, but not for much longer.

48:21.440 --> 48:24.609
Have you gone mad?
Quick, Captain, help me!

48:24.986 --> 48:27.404
- Captain, help me, quick!
- He's right. What have I done?

48:27.488 --> 48:29.823
- What have I done?
- No, Captain, not that!

48:32.493 --> 48:34.911
Thundering typhoons!

48:35.746 --> 48:37.122
Well, this is a fine mess.

48:37.206 --> 48:38.206
- I'm weak.
- We're stranded here...

48:38.291 --> 48:40.083
- Selfish.
...with no hope of rescue...

48:40.167 --> 48:41.293
I'm hopeless.

48:41.377 --> 48:43.336
While Sakharine and his men
are halfway to Bagghar.

48:43.421 --> 48:45.505
Poor, miserable wretch!

48:45.590 --> 48:47.132
Yes, all right. That's enough of that.

48:48.342 --> 48:52.095
It was his fault, you see.
It was Sir Francis.

48:52.179 --> 48:53.597
Tell me, how did you work that one out?

48:53.681 --> 48:56.683
Because he was a figurehead
of great courage and bold exploits.

48:56.767 --> 48:59.853
No one like him ever existed in my family.

49:00.938 --> 49:02.939
Why do you think I drink?

49:03.024 --> 49:05.108
Because I know I'll never be like him.

49:05.192 --> 49:10.030
No, it's far better that I end it now.
Put us both out of our misery.

49:12.199 --> 49:13.783
What is it, Snowy?

49:13.868 --> 49:16.411
I'm gonna lower myself into the sea.

49:19.165 --> 49:23.460
Into the cold embrace of the big blue!

49:24.128 --> 49:25.587
Those are Portuguese markings.

49:25.671 --> 49:28.673
- Are you even listening?
- Where is the Karaboudjan registered?

49:28.758 --> 49:30.342
We're saved.

49:30.426 --> 49:31.760
We're saved!

49:31.844 --> 49:34.888
It's a sign from above!

49:40.895 --> 49:43.480
- Troglodytes!
- Captain, get down.

49:43.564 --> 49:47.984
Slave-traders! Mutant malingerers!

49:48.069 --> 49:50.904
Freshwater politicians!

49:51.989 --> 49:54.491
Bad news, Captain.
We've only got one bullet.

49:54.575 --> 49:57.494
- And what's the good news?
- We've got one bullet.

50:10.508 --> 50:11.758
You got him!

50:17.056 --> 50:18.306
Well done, my boy.

50:26.148 --> 50:27.315
Stay here, Captain.

50:28.109 --> 50:30.902
Tintin?

50:30.986 --> 50:34.239
- Don't take your eyes off of them.
- Hurry up!

50:35.616 --> 50:39.202
Just as I thought.
The ignition lead has been cut.

50:40.287 --> 50:41.996
Lucky shot!

50:42.081 --> 50:44.499
One more pass, and we will finish them off.

50:45.710 --> 50:46.793
Put your hands in the air.

50:48.170 --> 50:49.254
Now!

50:53.509 --> 50:54.801
Let's see here.

50:56.387 --> 50:59.139
You do know what you're doing, eh, Tintin?

51:00.391 --> 51:01.850
More or less.

51:04.186 --> 51:06.771
Well, which is it? More or less?

51:06.856 --> 51:10.191
Relax. I interviewed a pilot once.

51:19.827 --> 51:21.870
Which way to North Africa?

51:33.966 --> 51:35.467
Captain, look!

51:35.843 --> 51:37.886
We've caught up with them.

51:39.889 --> 51:41.598
Wonderful!

51:41.682 --> 51:44.476
But you think we might find another way
to North Africa

51:44.560 --> 51:47.270
that doesn't take us
through that Wall of Death?

51:52.234 --> 51:54.152
We can't turn back.

51:54.236 --> 51:57.530
Not now.

52:19.595 --> 52:23.181
No, Captain! Those are surgical spirits
for medicinal purposes only.

52:23.307 --> 52:25.725
Quite right, laddie, quite right.

53:23.409 --> 53:24.659
No, no, no!

53:24.743 --> 53:27.245
The fuel tank! It's almost empty!

53:27.329 --> 53:29.998
Captain! This may sound crazy,
but I've got a plan.

53:30.624 --> 53:34.168
The alcohol in that bottle
may give us a few more miles.

53:35.170 --> 53:38.673
I need you to climb out of the plane
and pour it into the fuel tank.

53:38.757 --> 53:40.466
Christopher Columbus!

53:47.099 --> 53:49.601
There's a terrible storm out there.

53:50.853 --> 53:52.770
And it's raining.

53:53.564 --> 53:55.481
And you call yourself a Haddock?

54:01.363 --> 54:02.614
Captain!

54:02.698 --> 54:05.074
Captain! Can you hear me?

54:05.159 --> 54:06.409
Captain!

54:07.244 --> 54:08.494
Captain?

54:10.456 --> 54:14.125
You're doing fine!
Now, pour the bottle into the tank.

54:15.044 --> 54:16.961
We're running on fumes.

54:18.339 --> 54:20.006
Fumes!

54:28.682 --> 54:30.016
Oh, no.

54:45.574 --> 54:47.450
Captain! I can't see!

54:47.534 --> 54:49.243
Land! Land!

54:49.745 --> 54:51.496
We can't! We're not there yet!

54:51.580 --> 54:53.373
No, land!

55:01.173 --> 55:02.966
No, no, no, starboard!
Starboard! Starboard!

55:45.551 --> 55:47.135
Hang on, Tintin!

55:48.804 --> 55:50.930
I'm coming!

56:34.850 --> 56:39.395
The Land of Thirst.

56:39.480 --> 56:41.981
- The Land of Thirst.
- Will you stop saying that?

56:42.066 --> 56:45.151
You don't understand. I've run out.

56:45.903 --> 56:49.947
I've run out.
You don't know what that means.

56:50.032 --> 56:51.741
Captain, we have to keep going.

56:51.825 --> 56:55.328
One step at a time. Come on, on your feet!
Lean your weight on me.

56:55.412 --> 56:58.873
A man can only hang on so long
without his vitals.

56:58.957 --> 57:02.043
Captain, calm down.
There are worse things than sobering up.

57:02.127 --> 57:03.711
Look! Tintin!

57:04.421 --> 57:05.546
We're saved.

57:06.423 --> 57:08.341
Water. Water!

57:08.675 --> 57:10.510
Stop! Captain!

57:10.844 --> 57:12.512
It's just a mirage!

57:12.596 --> 57:15.515
But it was here. I saw it.

57:15.599 --> 57:19.519
It was just your mind playing tricks.
It's the heat!

57:19.603 --> 57:21.270
I have to go home.

57:22.439 --> 57:24.774
- What?
- I have to go back to the sea.

57:24.858 --> 57:26.859
Captain, you're hallucinating.

57:26.944 --> 57:28.528
Look.

57:28.612 --> 57:32.198
Did you ever see a more beautiful sight?

57:33.700 --> 57:37.537
She's turning into the wind, all sails set.

57:38.747 --> 57:40.248
Triple masted.

57:40.624 --> 57:43.709
Double decks. Fifty guns.

57:44.753 --> 57:46.045
The Unicorn?

57:46.130 --> 57:49.465
- Isn't she a beauty?
- Yes! Yes, she is!

57:49.550 --> 57:52.468
Tell me, Captain, what else can you see?

57:53.846 --> 57:56.389
She's got the wind behind her.

57:56.473 --> 57:58.558
Look at the pace she's setting!

57:59.643 --> 58:02.520
Barely a day out of Barbados,

58:02.604 --> 58:05.314
a hold full of rum and the finest tobacco

58:05.399 --> 58:08.860
and the hearts of the sailors set for home.

58:35.470 --> 58:36.888
The red pennant.

58:37.347 --> 58:40.683
The blood runs cold in every sea captain
who looks upon that flag,

58:40.767 --> 58:43.019
for he knows he's facing
a fight to the death.

58:43.103 --> 58:46.939
But Sir Francis is a Haddock.

58:47.024 --> 58:50.526
And Haddocks don't flee.

58:53.197 --> 58:57.241
All hands on deck!
Gunners to their stations!

58:57.326 --> 59:00.077
Let's unload the King's shot into these

59:00.204 --> 59:02.788
yellow-bellied, lily-livered sea slugs!

59:02.873 --> 59:06.334
- Prepare to bring her about, Mr Nicholls.
- Aye-aye, Captain!

59:06.418 --> 59:08.502
Prepare to bring her about!

59:21.016 --> 59:22.433
Fire!

59:22.768 --> 59:24.727
Portside gun, fire!

59:27.314 --> 59:29.315
Look lively, lads!

59:44.581 --> 59:48.084
- Mr Nicholls, secure the cargo.
- Right you are, sir.

59:48.168 --> 59:50.836
Prepare to repel all boarders!

01:00:27.124 --> 01:00:29.959
This way! We need more men!

01:01:26.266 --> 01:01:27.600
And then he saw him.

01:01:29.853 --> 01:01:33.439
Like a phantom, rising from the dead.

01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:36.692
Who?

01:01:36.777 --> 01:01:39.028
Captain, who did he see?

01:01:40.989 --> 01:01:42.615
It's gone.

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:46.535
What do you mean, gone?
What happened next?

01:01:47.287 --> 01:01:50.956
By Jupiter, I have a beard!
Since when did I have a beard?

01:01:51.041 --> 01:01:53.709
Captain, something happened
on the Unicorn.

01:01:53.794 --> 01:01:57.380
It's the key to everything.
You must try to remember.

01:01:57.464 --> 01:02:00.216
The Unicorn? What? I'm so terribly thirsty.

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:02.635
- Captain!
- Tintin!

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:04.678
What is happening to me?

01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:15.231
And to think all it took was a day
in the Sahara.

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:19.151
Congratulations, Captain, you're sober.

01:02:20.153 --> 01:02:22.363
Sober.

01:02:38.505 --> 01:02:39.797
Good dog!

01:02:42.175 --> 01:02:44.260
This one's alive.

01:02:44.344 --> 01:02:46.345
- Check the other!
- Yes, sir.

01:02:49.474 --> 01:02:51.642
Company, halt!

01:02:51.768 --> 01:02:55.438
I'm Lieutenant Delcourt.
Welcome to the Afghar Outpost.

01:02:55.522 --> 01:02:58.691
Thank you, Lieutenant.
We owe you our lives.

01:02:58.775 --> 01:03:03.070
- Did you find my friend?
- Yes, but he's not in good shape, I'm afraid.

01:03:03.155 --> 01:03:07.616
He's still suffering the effects
of acute dehydration. He's quite delirious.

01:03:07.701 --> 01:03:09.869
Why don't we pay him a visit?

01:03:10.579 --> 01:03:12.913
Haddock! You're awake.

01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:16.167
Good! I have a visitor for you.

01:03:16.543 --> 01:03:18.335
- Captain?
- Hello!

01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:20.129
I think you've got the wrong room.

01:03:21.715 --> 01:03:23.549
Captain, it's Tintin.

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:26.135
Our plane crashed in the desert.
Don't you remember?

01:03:26.219 --> 01:03:29.972
Plane? No, no, I'm a naval man myself.
I never fly if I can help it.

01:03:30.056 --> 01:03:32.433
He's got me confused with someone else.

01:03:32.517 --> 01:03:35.144
What is this peculiar liquid?

01:03:35.228 --> 01:03:37.646
There's no bouquet.
It's completely transparent.

01:03:37.731 --> 01:03:38.814
Why, it's water.

01:03:38.899 --> 01:03:41.317
What will they think of next?

01:03:43.737 --> 01:03:47.823
We suspect he has a concussion.
Heatstroke. Delirium.

01:03:47.908 --> 01:03:49.492
He's sober.

01:03:49.576 --> 01:03:52.077
Now, Captain, out in the desert...

01:03:52.162 --> 01:03:54.580
- The desert?
- Yes. You were talking about Sir Francis.

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:56.999
- Sir who?
- Sir Francis.

01:03:57.083 --> 01:03:59.251
And you were telling me
about what happened on the Unicorn.

01:03:59.336 --> 01:04:01.504
- The unicorn!
- Yes!

01:04:01.588 --> 01:04:04.173
The stuff that dreams are made of.

01:04:04.257 --> 01:04:06.008
Wee children's dreams.

01:04:06.092 --> 01:04:09.428
No, the ship.
Please try to remember, Captain.

01:04:09.513 --> 01:04:11.180
Lives are at risk.

01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:17.728
Snowy, what have you done?

01:04:22.025 --> 01:04:23.984
I'd stand back if I were you.

01:04:27.113 --> 01:04:29.740
Out! Everybody out of the room!

01:04:30.534 --> 01:04:31.867
Snowy!

01:04:31.952 --> 01:04:33.702
This man is insane!

01:04:40.335 --> 01:04:44.129
Show yourself, Red Rackham!

01:04:50.303 --> 01:04:53.681
If it's a fight you want,
you've met your match!

01:04:53.765 --> 01:04:54.932
A fight with who?

01:04:55.308 --> 01:04:58.602
To the death, Red Rackham!

01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:23.002
No, wait!

01:05:26.172 --> 01:05:27.464
Wait. Captain...

01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:31.010
I remember everything now.

01:05:31.094 --> 01:05:33.345
Everything Granddaddy told me.

01:05:34.097 --> 01:05:36.932
The Unicorn was taken.

01:05:37.434 --> 01:05:40.394
The pirates were now masters of the ship.

01:05:40.478 --> 01:05:41.854
The crew surrendered?

01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:47.860
Granddaddy said that Red Rackham
called Sir Francis the King's dog.

01:05:47.986 --> 01:05:52.156
A pirate hunter sent to reclaim
their hard-won plunder.

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:57.995
Why would I waste my time on rum,
tobacco, molasses and dates

01:05:58.079 --> 01:06:01.123
when you have
a more valuable cargo onboard?

01:06:01.207 --> 01:06:02.708
Where is it?

01:06:03.251 --> 01:06:05.377
You'll have to kill me first.

01:06:05.462 --> 01:06:07.212
Not first, no.

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:08.505
Please.

01:06:09.049 --> 01:06:11.050
I'll start with your men.

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:16.138
To save his men,

01:06:16.222 --> 01:06:19.141
he would give up the secret cargo.

01:06:19.225 --> 01:06:20.726
And where was it?

01:06:39.496 --> 01:06:44.625
Four hundredweight
of gold, jewels and treasure.

01:06:54.761 --> 01:06:56.428
Kill his men!

01:06:56.554 --> 01:06:58.555
No, Rackham! No!

01:07:00.016 --> 01:07:03.018
Rackham, you gave me your word! Rackham!

01:07:03.353 --> 01:07:05.020
Rackham!

01:07:08.525 --> 01:07:11.443
Sir Francis knew he was doomed.

01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:14.405
That he'd be hung from the highest yardarm.

01:07:15.699 --> 01:07:17.700
But they didn't reckon on one thing!

01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:21.120
Sir Francis was a Haddock.

01:07:21.621 --> 01:07:26.250
And a Haddock always has a trick
up his sleeve.

01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:45.227
And with that, he hurls himself forward!

01:07:45.311 --> 01:07:47.396
On the pirates? Like that? Unarmed?

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:50.315
No! No, on a bottle of rum
rolling on the deck.

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:53.736
And he opens it up,
and puts it to his lips, and...

01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:55.070
And then he stops.

01:07:55.155 --> 01:07:58.657
"This is no time for drinking," he says.
"I need all my wits about me."

01:07:58.742 --> 01:08:01.660
With that, he puts down the bottle and...

01:08:01.745 --> 01:08:03.287
Yes, yes, he puts down the bottle...

01:08:03.371 --> 01:08:05.622
And he seizes a cutlass.

01:08:05.999 --> 01:08:11.712
And then he makes his way
to the ship's magazine,

01:08:11.796 --> 01:08:14.840
where they keep all the gunpowder
and the shot!

01:08:27.604 --> 01:08:29.479
You dog!

01:08:29.564 --> 01:08:31.774
You'd blow us sky high?

01:08:31.858 --> 01:08:33.358
Come on, then.

01:08:34.444 --> 01:08:35.986
Let's have you.

01:08:39.491 --> 01:08:41.408
Not this time.

01:09:41.261 --> 01:09:42.761
You!

01:09:43.263 --> 01:09:44.429
Captain, what is it?

01:09:47.433 --> 01:09:50.185
How could I be so blind?

01:09:50.270 --> 01:09:52.187
What are you talking about?

01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:56.900
This isn't just about the scrolls or...

01:09:56.985 --> 01:09:59.319
Or the treasure that
went down with the ship.

01:10:01.114 --> 01:10:02.447
It's me.

01:10:03.825 --> 01:10:05.576
It's me he's after!

01:10:08.121 --> 01:10:11.832
You'll suffer a curse upon you
and your name, Haddock.

01:10:11.916 --> 01:10:13.792
He wants vengeance.

01:10:15.461 --> 01:10:17.963
Come back and face me!

01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:19.423
- Hurry, Tintin.
- What?

01:10:19.507 --> 01:10:21.174
- We're out of time.
- Captain!

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:39.359
I curse you!

01:10:39.611 --> 01:10:44.197
I curse your name and all who come after!

01:10:44.282 --> 01:10:46.825
We will meet again, Haddock!

01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:50.162
In another time! In another life!

01:11:09.849 --> 01:11:12.267
It's not over. It was never over!

01:11:12.352 --> 01:11:14.561
I don't understand. Who's after your blood?

01:11:14.646 --> 01:11:16.855
- Sakharine!
- Sakharine? Why?

01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:20.609
He's Red Rackham's descendent!
He means to finish it!

01:11:20.693 --> 01:11:22.527
- That's why he did it.
- Did what?

01:11:22.612 --> 01:11:26.573
Sank his own ship. Sir Francis sent
that treasure to the bottom of the sea.

01:11:26.658 --> 01:11:28.867
He would be damned
before he let Red Rackham have it.

01:11:28.993 --> 01:11:30.619
- And he was.
- But he couldn't let it lie.

01:11:30.703 --> 01:11:32.245
- No.
- He left a clue.

01:11:32.330 --> 01:11:35.207
Three clues wrapped in a riddle,
concealing a secret.

01:11:35.291 --> 01:11:37.960
But only a true Haddock
would be able to solve it.

01:11:38.044 --> 01:11:40.379
- What secret?
- The location.

01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:43.298
To one of the greatest sunken treasures
in all history.

01:11:43.383 --> 01:11:46.218
The wreck of the Unicorn.

01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:50.222
He means to steal it! The third scroll!

01:11:51.099 --> 01:11:53.809
Billions of blue, blistering barnacles!

01:11:53.893 --> 01:11:58.730
I swear, as the last of the Haddocks,
I'll find that treasure before him!

01:11:59.065 --> 01:12:02.275
To Bagghar.

01:12:22.672 --> 01:12:24.006
He's here.

01:12:48.197 --> 01:12:50.449
It's no good. They could be anywhere.

01:12:54.162 --> 01:12:55.620
Captain.

01:12:55.705 --> 01:12:58.206
Don't look now, but we're being followed.

01:12:59.917 --> 01:13:02.085
Yes, we are.

01:13:05.631 --> 01:13:08.592
What do you want?
Why are you following us?

01:13:08.676 --> 01:13:11.553
Who are you working for?

01:13:11.637 --> 01:13:13.055
Captain, stop! Stop!

01:13:14.057 --> 01:13:15.891
- Thompson and Thomson.
- Not so loud.

01:13:15.975 --> 01:13:18.143
- We're in disguise.
- So I see.

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:20.228
You got the message I sent from the ship?

01:13:20.313 --> 01:13:22.731
Yes, well, bit of a long story, that.

01:13:22.815 --> 01:13:25.233
The upshot is we caught the thief,
retrieved your wallet,

01:13:25.318 --> 01:13:26.985
and then hopped on the next plane
to Bagghar.

01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:30.072
Yes, that pocket picker
has picked his last pocket.

01:13:30.156 --> 01:13:32.908
There. Don't worry.
He didn't take any money.

01:13:32.992 --> 01:13:35.619
It's not the money I'm worried about.

01:13:40.541 --> 01:13:41.708
The odds are even.

01:13:43.086 --> 01:13:45.504
Now, to find the next two scrolls.

01:13:50.176 --> 01:13:51.885
The Milanese Nightingale.

01:13:59.519 --> 01:14:01.353
That's his secret weapon?

01:14:01.521 --> 01:14:03.188
- My!
- My!

01:14:04.941 --> 01:14:06.650
What a dish.

01:14:12.365 --> 01:14:14.116
Enchanted, signora!

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.785
Benvenuto! Welcome! Marhaba!

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:19.704
We are blessed with your presence.

01:14:19.789 --> 01:14:24.376
Yes. Indeed, Signor Salad!

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:27.129
What charming peasants.

01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:30.966
May I introduce my escort,

01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:34.219
Monsieur Shuggair Addeitiff.

01:14:35.054 --> 01:14:36.471
He's been very

01:14:37.974 --> 01:14:41.893
passionate in his support of this concert.

01:14:41.978 --> 01:14:45.313
It's my first visit to the Third World.

01:14:45.398 --> 01:14:50.068
Please forgive me. I must escort madame
to her dressing room. Excuse us.

01:14:55.575 --> 01:14:56.908
After you.

01:15:08.254 --> 01:15:11.089
- Hello, how are you?
- Hello...

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:17.554
Here. I want you to look after this.

01:15:18.139 --> 01:15:19.389
- What are you doing?
- Me?

01:15:19.473 --> 01:15:21.224
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

01:15:21.309 --> 01:15:23.518
If I'm caught,
I don't want them to find this on me.

01:15:23.603 --> 01:15:25.854
Look, just keep it hidden.

01:15:26.814 --> 01:15:28.857
I will guard this with my life!

01:15:28.941 --> 01:15:30.108
Get up! Get up!

01:16:06.145 --> 01:16:07.479
It's her!

01:17:00.866 --> 01:17:02.701
Blistering barnacles!

01:17:03.995 --> 01:17:05.662
What's that noise?

01:17:12.586 --> 01:17:13.920
My ears,

01:17:15.298 --> 01:17:17.340
- they're bleeding.
- No, they're not.

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:28.810
Captain.

01:17:31.897 --> 01:17:33.398
Shut up, Snowy.

01:17:40.448 --> 01:17:43.408
Oh, Columbus, it's every man for himself!
Make way.

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:45.994
Make way! Medical emergency.

01:18:07.808 --> 01:18:08.933
That was close.

01:18:10.895 --> 01:18:12.020
Hello, Captain.

01:18:12.104 --> 01:18:13.188
You!

01:18:49.308 --> 01:18:50.433
Oh, no!

01:18:53.938 --> 01:18:55.271
Sakharine!

01:19:22.341 --> 01:19:24.342
The falcon! Snowy, after him!

01:19:24.468 --> 01:19:27.011
Tintin! Tintin!

01:19:27.096 --> 01:19:29.973
Those two! There!
They're here to steal your ship!

01:19:30.057 --> 01:19:31.474
No, no, no, no, no, we're not!

01:19:31.559 --> 01:19:33.726
Arrest him! The ugly one!

01:19:33.811 --> 01:19:35.270
- No, wait!
- Who, me?

01:19:35.354 --> 01:19:36.438
Yes!

01:19:36.522 --> 01:19:38.273
Thief! Arrest him!

01:20:00.212 --> 01:20:01.463
Captain!

01:20:03.883 --> 01:20:05.967
- Sakharine's got the scroll!
- It's worse than that.

01:20:06.051 --> 01:20:09.721
- What do you mean?
- They took your scroll, Tintin. It's gone.

01:20:09.805 --> 01:20:11.806
How? What happened?

01:20:11.891 --> 01:20:13.766
It was Allan.

01:20:13.851 --> 01:20:16.561
He knobbled me in the garden, and then

01:20:16.645 --> 01:20:18.938
- there was a bottle of alcohol and...
- There always is.

01:20:19.023 --> 01:20:21.399
No, no! No, not like that.

01:20:23.486 --> 01:20:25.361
I can smell it on you.

01:20:33.078 --> 01:20:34.621
Hurry. Back to the boat.

01:20:35.873 --> 01:20:38.791
- Tintin! Where are you going?
- I'm going after Sakharine.

01:20:38.876 --> 01:20:40.668
- By yourself?
- Yes!

01:20:40.753 --> 01:20:42.253
Come on, Snowy!

01:20:45.549 --> 01:20:47.717
Catch them, catch them!

01:21:00.397 --> 01:21:03.233
Lose them! Get him off our tail!

01:21:16.455 --> 01:21:18.289
Did you hit anything?

01:21:21.252 --> 01:21:22.710
Oh, dear.

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:30.426
Faster, you idiot, faster!

01:21:36.433 --> 01:21:38.142
Not again!

01:21:39.353 --> 01:21:41.312
- I'll have those, thank you.
- Come on, Snowy!

01:21:41.397 --> 01:21:42.438
No!

01:21:42.523 --> 01:21:44.774
Incoming falcon at four o'clock!

01:21:57.830 --> 01:22:00.498
Tintin, faster!

01:22:03.168 --> 01:22:06.004
- The scrolls!
- I got one, two...

01:22:06.088 --> 01:22:07.338
And three!

01:22:08.716 --> 01:22:10.049
Snowy!

01:22:19.685 --> 01:22:21.352
Oh, no! Not again.

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:25.273
Come here, my beauty.

01:22:27.526 --> 01:22:31.696
Ten thousand thundering typhoons!
Come here, you pilfering parakeet!

01:22:34.033 --> 01:22:36.159
Captain, the bird! Grab it!

01:22:41.457 --> 01:22:43.958
Nice work, Snowy! Don't let him go!

01:22:51.842 --> 01:22:54.677
You blue blistering barnacles!

01:22:55.721 --> 01:22:58.139
Hang on, Snowy! Snowy, I'm coming!

01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:06.272
There he is! Stop!

01:23:06.357 --> 01:23:08.524
That's right, that's right, come to Daddy.

01:23:08.609 --> 01:23:10.234
Come to Daddy.

01:23:10.319 --> 01:23:11.402
Gotcha!

01:23:13.238 --> 01:23:14.572
No!

01:23:18.285 --> 01:23:21.079
Geronimo!

01:23:22.581 --> 01:23:25.667
You double-dealing, pilfering parasites!

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:35.385
Excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry.

01:24:04.665 --> 01:24:05.957
Gotcha!

01:24:10.963 --> 01:24:12.922
The scrolls are lining up.

01:24:13.006 --> 01:24:14.632
These are hidden numbers.

01:24:17.094 --> 01:24:18.344
What does it say?

01:24:18.429 --> 01:24:20.596
I wouldn't do that if I were you!

01:24:21.306 --> 01:24:22.932
Let the bird go.

01:24:25.436 --> 01:24:28.563
What do you value more,
those scrolls or Haddock's life?

01:24:28.647 --> 01:24:29.731
Don't listen to him.

01:24:29.815 --> 01:24:32.191
You'll never get away with this,
you sour-faced sassonack!

01:24:32.276 --> 01:24:33.443
I will kill him.

01:24:35.404 --> 01:24:37.613
Don't worry about me, Tintin, I'm fine.

01:24:37.698 --> 01:24:40.742
Let the bird go now, or this man dies!

01:24:40.826 --> 01:24:42.118
No! Wait!

01:24:42.828 --> 01:24:46.831
You two-timing troglodyte!
You simpering son of a po-faced profiteer!

01:24:46.915 --> 01:24:51.085
Perhaps we should put it to the test.
Here's mud in your eye.

01:24:51.170 --> 01:24:52.253
Fathead!

01:24:52.337 --> 01:24:53.588
Captain!

01:25:19.656 --> 01:25:22.366
- We're saved!
- I love the beach.

01:25:22.451 --> 01:25:25.411
- You said you wanted a holiday.
- Quite.

01:25:25.496 --> 01:25:26.829
Very good.

01:25:34.671 --> 01:25:38.132
- Nobody takes my ship!
- They've already taken it.

01:25:38.217 --> 01:25:40.676
Nobody takes my ship twice!

01:25:41.053 --> 01:25:44.138
We'll show them, won't we, Tintin?
All right then, what's the plan?

01:25:44.223 --> 01:25:45.264
There is no plan.

01:25:45.349 --> 01:25:47.558
Of course there's a plan.
You've always got a plan.

01:25:47.643 --> 01:25:48.726
Not this time.

01:25:49.353 --> 01:25:52.647
Sakharine has the scrolls.
They'll lead him to the treasure.

01:25:52.731 --> 01:25:56.067
It could be anywhere in the world.
We'll never see him again.

01:25:57.069 --> 01:25:58.402
It's over.

01:25:59.571 --> 01:26:02.240
I thought you were an optimist.

01:26:02.324 --> 01:26:05.493
Well, you were wrong, weren't you?
I'm a realist.

01:26:05.577 --> 01:26:07.912
That's just another name for a quitter.

01:26:07.996 --> 01:26:10.498
You can call me what you like.

01:26:10.582 --> 01:26:13.251
Don't you get it? We failed.

01:26:14.211 --> 01:26:15.378
"Failed."

01:26:16.672 --> 01:26:20.007
There are plenty of others
willing to call you a failure.

01:26:20.092 --> 01:26:24.387
A fool. A loser. A hopeless souse!

01:26:24.471 --> 01:26:27.557
Don't you ever say it of yourself.

01:26:29.434 --> 01:26:33.521
You send out the wrong signal.
That is what people pick up.

01:26:33.605 --> 01:26:35.773
Do you understand?

01:26:35.858 --> 01:26:38.860
You care about something, you fight for it.

01:26:38.944 --> 01:26:42.113
You hit a wall, you push through it.

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:47.034
There's something you need to know
about failure, Tintin.

01:26:51.623 --> 01:26:53.958
You can never let it defeat you.

01:26:55.127 --> 01:26:56.752
What did you just say?

01:26:56.837 --> 01:26:59.046
You hit a wall, you push through it.

01:26:59.131 --> 01:27:02.800
No, no, no, you said something
about sending out a signal.

01:27:06.138 --> 01:27:08.723
Of course! Captain!

01:27:08.807 --> 01:27:11.350
I sent a radio message
from the Karaboudjan.

01:27:11.435 --> 01:27:13.561
I know what radio frequency
they're transmitting on.

01:27:13.645 --> 01:27:14.937
Well, how does that help us?

01:27:15.022 --> 01:27:17.231
All we have to do
is send that information to Interpol,

01:27:17.316 --> 01:27:19.650
they can track the signals
and figure out which way they're headed.

01:27:19.735 --> 01:27:20.776
Here comes Interpol now.

01:27:20.986 --> 01:27:22.361
- Tintin!
- Tintin!

01:27:22.446 --> 01:27:24.822
Any port they enter we'll know at once.

01:27:24.990 --> 01:27:27.658
And we can get there first.

01:27:39.421 --> 01:27:43.466
What are we doing here, boss? I don't get it.
We're right back where we started.

01:27:43.550 --> 01:27:45.760
You're to speak of this to no one.
Keep your mouths shut.

01:27:45.844 --> 01:27:49.597
- Don't worry. As long as we get our share.
- You'll get your share.

01:27:49.681 --> 01:27:50.973
- Where are you going?
- Just guard the ship.

01:27:51.058 --> 01:27:52.266
Where's the filthy moolah?

01:27:52.351 --> 01:27:55.436
Good evening, sir.
I trust you had a successful trip abroad.

01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:58.064
Do I pay you to talk to me?

01:27:58.148 --> 01:28:00.107
You don't pay me at all.

01:28:02.444 --> 01:28:03.945
What the blazes? Nestor!

01:28:05.364 --> 01:28:06.530
Nestor!

01:28:09.618 --> 01:28:11.118
Tom! Allan!

01:28:11.203 --> 01:28:15.289
You blithering idiots, don't
just stand there! Do something!

01:28:21.546 --> 01:28:23.422
Caught him like a rat in a trap.

01:28:24.007 --> 01:28:26.717
Congratulations, gentlemen. He's all yours.

01:28:26.802 --> 01:28:30.972
Yes! We also have an arrest warrant issued
by both Interpol and the FBI.

01:28:31.056 --> 01:28:33.015
- Your friend who got shot...
- Barnaby.

01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:35.977
He was one of their agents.
Hot on Sakharine's trail from the start.

01:28:36.061 --> 01:28:37.728
It still doesn't make sense.

01:28:37.813 --> 01:28:40.106
He has the key to the
treasure of the Unicorn,

01:28:40.190 --> 01:28:42.984
which is sitting somewhere
on the ocean floor.

01:28:43.068 --> 01:28:44.694
Why would he come back home?

01:28:49.408 --> 01:28:50.616
Right.

01:28:50.701 --> 01:28:51.784
- Sakharine?
- Sakharine?

01:28:51.868 --> 01:28:54.078
That's Mr Sakharine to you.

01:28:54.705 --> 01:28:55.955
Hold it.

01:29:02.671 --> 01:29:03.838
- Look out!
- What...

01:29:03.922 --> 01:29:05.131
Oh, no!

01:29:10.303 --> 01:29:12.763
Allan! Allan, get me down!

01:29:16.435 --> 01:29:18.144
What? Not that way!

01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:24.942
Not that way, you fool, the other way!

01:29:36.079 --> 01:29:37.679
Right.

01:30:05.484 --> 01:30:06.776
Look out!

01:30:25.670 --> 01:30:27.671
Good Lord! Come on!

01:30:36.139 --> 01:30:37.848
Close but no cigar!

01:31:18.348 --> 01:31:22.309
- Red Rackham!
- That's right. My ancestor.

01:31:22.394 --> 01:31:24.311
Just as Sir Francis was yours.

01:31:24.396 --> 01:31:25.855
Unfinished business.

01:31:25.939 --> 01:31:30.276
I'm glad you know the truth, Haddock.
Until you could remember,

01:31:30.569 --> 01:31:33.821
killing you
wouldn't have been this much fun.

01:31:59.764 --> 01:32:03.058
Who gave you permission to board my ship?

01:32:03.310 --> 01:32:05.186
I don't need it.

01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:06.854
I've never needed it.

01:33:09.167 --> 01:33:13.462
The legend says only a Haddock
can discover the secret of the Unicorn,

01:33:14.839 --> 01:33:18.050
but it took a Rackham to get the job done.

01:33:18.134 --> 01:33:20.344
So you've lost again, Haddock.

01:33:20.845 --> 01:33:24.098
That's right. Why don't you have a drink?

01:33:24.182 --> 01:33:26.600
That's all you've got left, isn't it?

01:33:26.685 --> 01:33:30.437
Everything that was rightfully yours
is now mine.

01:33:30.689 --> 01:33:32.481
Including this ship.

01:33:38.196 --> 01:33:42.616
Thundering typhoons.
Nobody takes my ship.

01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:04.221
We have you now, you devil.

01:34:05.181 --> 01:34:07.766
- You are under arrest.
- To be precise,

01:34:08.810 --> 01:34:09.977
you are under arrest.

01:34:24.326 --> 01:34:25.826
Do you see?

01:34:28.913 --> 01:34:31.206
Blistering barnacles, they're coordinates.

01:34:31.291 --> 01:34:35.502
- It took all three scrolls to form the numbers.
- Latitude and longitude.

01:34:35.587 --> 01:34:38.756
That is it.
That's the location of the treasure.

01:34:43.094 --> 01:34:44.428
We did it!

01:34:55.482 --> 01:34:58.692
Almost there, Mr Tintin!

01:34:58.777 --> 01:35:00.694
A nudge to starboard should do it.

01:35:00.779 --> 01:35:04.073
- Are you sure we're on course?
- Trust me, laddie.

01:35:04.157 --> 01:35:07.201
I know these parts like
the back of my hand.

01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:11.038
Starboard! Quickly! Quickly!

01:35:11.122 --> 01:35:13.374
Aye, Captain, starboard it is!

01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:22.591
All stop!

01:35:28.765 --> 01:35:31.892
Marlinspike Hall.

01:35:31.976 --> 01:35:34.228
Those coordinates lead here.

01:35:35.063 --> 01:35:37.272
And this is where Sir Francis hid it?

01:35:38.608 --> 01:35:41.026
I thought the treasure went down
with the ship.

01:35:41.111 --> 01:35:45.114
Master Haddock, Mr Tintin,
I've been expecting you.

01:35:47.325 --> 01:35:49.701
Welcome to Marlinspike Hall.

01:35:49.786 --> 01:35:51.787
Will you look at this place?

01:35:51.871 --> 01:35:54.915
I don't think it's changed at all
since I was a wee boy.

01:35:54.999 --> 01:35:57.501
And may I say, sir,
how much I'm looking forward

01:35:57.585 --> 01:36:00.003
to having a Haddock
back in charge of the estate.

01:36:00.088 --> 01:36:04.883
You'll be waiting a long time, Nestor.
There's no way I could afford to live here!

01:36:04.968 --> 01:36:07.928
Well, Captain, you know the house.

01:36:08.012 --> 01:36:09.680
Where do we start?

01:36:10.598 --> 01:36:12.141
Is the cellar still here?

01:36:22.193 --> 01:36:24.278
No, no, no, no, this isn't it.

01:36:24.362 --> 01:36:25.487
I meant the other cellar.

01:36:25.572 --> 01:36:28.449
I'm sorry, sir, there is no "other cellar."

01:36:28.908 --> 01:36:30.367
It was bigger than this.

01:36:30.493 --> 01:36:31.743
Snowy.

01:36:32.829 --> 01:36:34.246
Snowy, where are you?

01:36:34.789 --> 01:36:36.165
No, Hector.

01:36:38.918 --> 01:36:40.002
Hector.

01:36:40.086 --> 01:36:41.712
Captain, help me.

01:36:48.052 --> 01:36:49.386
Heel, boy.

01:36:52.432 --> 01:36:53.599
Snowy?

01:36:57.020 --> 01:36:58.437
Just like you said, Captain.

01:36:59.564 --> 01:37:01.064
You hit a wall...

01:37:01.733 --> 01:37:03.901
you push through it.

01:37:08.740 --> 01:37:11.408
My grandfather must have walled it up
before he lost the house.

01:37:11.493 --> 01:37:14.411
"And then shines forth the Eagle's Cross."

01:37:21.586 --> 01:37:24.963
Well, I can see the cross,
but where's the eagle?

01:37:25.048 --> 01:37:26.673
St John the Evangelist,

01:37:27.175 --> 01:37:29.676
who was always depicted with an eagle.

01:37:29.761 --> 01:37:31.803
And he's called the Eagle of Patmos.

01:37:32.430 --> 01:37:34.139
He is the eagle.

01:37:36.351 --> 01:37:39.603
What's he trying to tell us, Captain?

01:37:39.687 --> 01:37:41.188
I'm at a loss.

01:37:42.190 --> 01:37:44.983
That island, the one in the middle,
that doesn't exist.

01:37:45.485 --> 01:37:46.568
How do you know?

01:37:46.653 --> 01:37:49.238
Because I've sailed those waters
countless times.

01:37:49.322 --> 01:37:51.865
I've been there. It's a mistake.

01:37:55.453 --> 01:37:56.828
What if it isn't?

01:37:58.498 --> 01:38:02.584
Sir Francis wanted his inheritance
to go to a man who was worthy of it.

01:38:03.294 --> 01:38:08.715
A man like himself, who knows the seas
like the back of his hand.

01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:12.219
A man who could look at a globe

01:38:12.303 --> 01:38:15.556
and tell if one tiny island

01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:17.307
was out of place.

01:38:30.822 --> 01:38:32.823
Blistering treasure.

01:38:33.575 --> 01:38:36.326
It's Red Rackham's barnacles!

01:38:42.333 --> 01:38:43.834
What is this?

01:39:26.169 --> 01:39:28.128
Just a wee tipple.

01:39:28.212 --> 01:39:31.256
A toast to our good fortune.

01:39:33.468 --> 01:39:34.926
That's better.

01:39:35.011 --> 01:39:36.470
It's odd, really. You would've thought,

01:39:36.554 --> 01:39:38.764
after all the fuss and bother,
there would've been more.

01:39:38.848 --> 01:39:41.391
- More of what?
- Red Rackham's treasure.

01:39:41.476 --> 01:39:45.687
I mean, by your account, he looted
half of South America. I just thought...

01:39:45.772 --> 01:39:48.523
Never mind. There's plenty to go around.

01:39:50.068 --> 01:39:52.361
It's a funny old life, eh?

01:39:52.445 --> 01:39:55.697
Well, you've got your story
for your newspaper.

01:39:55.782 --> 01:39:57.824
All's well that ends well.

01:39:57.909 --> 01:40:00.077
It's not ended.

01:40:00.161 --> 01:40:03.288
Sir Francis left another clue
at the bottom of the globe.

01:40:03.373 --> 01:40:07.042
- A clue to what?
- Four hundredweight of gold,

01:40:07.126 --> 01:40:09.670
just lying at the bottom of the sea.

01:40:10.421 --> 01:40:13.256
How's your thirst for adventure, Captain?

01:40:15.385 --> 01:40:17.803
Unquenchable, Tintin.
