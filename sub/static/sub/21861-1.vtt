00:12.612 --> 00:15.248
Uh, please state your name,
and who you are.

00:16.015 --> 00:19.285
My name is Dylan Maxwell, and I'm...

00:23.156 --> 00:25.024
I don't know, dude. I'm just Dylan.

00:25.091 --> 00:27.427
What do you mean, who am I?
That's a stupid question.

00:27.494 --> 00:28.361
That's okay.

00:28.561 --> 00:32.432
Um... Uh, now, just look at me,
and not the camera, please.

00:33.633 --> 00:35.635
Dylan, why am I interviewing you?

00:36.436 --> 00:38.638
- Because everyone thinks I did it.
- Did what?

00:39.105 --> 00:40.073
The dicks.

00:46.413 --> 00:51.484
KOYF3's Erin Caldwell
is live on the scene in Oceanside. Erin?

00:51.551 --> 00:54.421
Chris, it is a shocking scene
for Hanover High teachers

00:54.487 --> 00:58.124
who left school today only to find
their cars vandalized with obscene images.

00:58.191 --> 01:02.062
It was supposed to be a quiet
administrative day at Hanover High.

01:02.128 --> 01:06.132
A day off for students, teachers took part
in a series of mandatory faculty...

01:06.399 --> 01:10.236
- Oh, my God, dude.
- Look what happened at school.

01:10.303 --> 01:12.572
They put a big one
on my Jeep Wrangler behind me.

01:12.639 --> 01:16.443
They got this entire row, as you can see.

01:16.509 --> 01:18.845
All the way back there,
they must've made a big loop,

01:19.112 --> 01:21.581
- and got pretty much everybody.
- Holy shit.

01:21.781 --> 01:23.650
- Are you getting the head?
- Yeah.

01:23.716 --> 01:25.084
For Principal Janet Regan,

01:25.151 --> 01:27.153
this type of mischief
is no laughing matter.

01:27.620 --> 01:29.789
I'm sure they thought it was a prank.

01:29.856 --> 01:33.760
But it's destruction of property.
We'll find out who did it.

01:33.827 --> 01:36.863
The vandal spray-painted obscene images
on 27 cars

01:37.130 --> 01:40.800
in the staff parking lot,
causing an estimated $100,000 in damages.

01:40.867 --> 01:43.570
As of now, investigators have no leads.

01:43.636 --> 01:45.538
Soon as I heard about the dicks, I knew.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.874
- This is what Dylan does.
- Dylan's a burnout loser.

01:48.141 --> 01:49.142
Of course, he did it.

01:49.209 --> 01:52.245
Dylan Maxwell
is the stupidest kid I've ever met.

01:52.312 --> 01:53.413
He's a fucking idiot.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.181
This is not an isolated incident.

01:55.615 --> 01:57.150
Dylan has a history

01:57.217 --> 01:59.419
- of this kind of behavior.
- Dylan.

01:59.486 --> 02:01.588
- This administration...
- Dylan!

02:01.654 --> 02:04.591
...has exhausted all other
disciplinary options with Dylan.

02:04.824 --> 02:08.328
For the sake of the other students
and their learning environment,

02:08.394 --> 02:11.598
I strongly recommend
that you vote to expel Dylan Maxwell

02:11.664 --> 02:13.833
for vandalizing the 27 vehicles.

02:17.670 --> 02:19.572
- Do you know who did it?
- No.

02:20.507 --> 02:21.541
But, like...

02:22.242 --> 02:24.210
"fuck you" to whoever did.

02:25.445 --> 02:26.579
I mean, seriously.

02:26.646 --> 02:29.716
Like, it's super fucking funny,
so, that's all chill, but...

02:31.451 --> 02:34.821
like, letting me get expelled
for something I didn't even do is just...

02:36.422 --> 02:38.691
It's just such a bitch move.

03:08.221 --> 03:10.356
Consider for a moment
the type of person

03:10.423 --> 03:13.526
who would spray-paint dicks
on cars in the staff parking lot.

03:13.960 --> 03:16.729
What do they look like?
Who do they hang out with?

03:17.263 --> 03:19.265
Where do they sit in the cafeteria?

03:19.499 --> 03:20.900
What kind of grades do they get?

03:21.601 --> 03:22.902
Is this what you're imagining?

03:23.603 --> 03:24.537
Probably not.

03:25.772 --> 03:26.639
How about her?

03:27.373 --> 03:28.241
Or him?

03:28.308 --> 03:29.275
Or her?

03:29.576 --> 03:30.810
It doesn't seem right.

03:31.644 --> 03:34.380
Or are you picturing someone
more like this?

03:35.615 --> 03:36.816
Yeah. You're not alone.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.551
The school board thought so, too.

03:39.485 --> 03:40.620
Everyone thinks I did it.

03:41.955 --> 03:42.956
Like, everyone.

03:44.591 --> 03:46.826
Except for my boys and my girl.

03:47.527 --> 03:48.995
Who I was with at the time.

03:50.730 --> 03:51.798
But no one believes us.

04:03.509 --> 04:04.711
So, here's what we know.

04:05.311 --> 04:08.314
Tuesday, March 15th, 2016.

04:08.481 --> 04:10.550
It was an admin day,
so, no classes were held.

04:11.584 --> 04:16.389
Twenty-seven dicks were spray-painted
onto 27 cars in the staff parking lot

04:16.456 --> 04:18.958
of Hanover High School
in Oceanside, California.

04:19.659 --> 04:20.760
It was horrible.

04:21.361 --> 04:22.795
I had to drive home with a big...

04:24.264 --> 04:24.995
...penis on my car.

04:26.299 --> 04:28.368
The children in the neighborhood saw it.

04:30.536 --> 04:35.375
I'll never understand
what's so amusing about penises.

04:35.808 --> 04:38.411
The vandalism occurred
between two and 2:30.

04:39.412 --> 04:42.015
We know this because the security footage
in the parking lot

04:42.282 --> 04:43.850
from that time frame is missing.

04:44.651 --> 04:47.620
Oceanside Police took statements
and collected spray paint left

04:47.687 --> 04:49.656
at the northeast corner
of the parking lot.

04:51.557 --> 04:54.661
A criminal hearing for Dylan
will likely take place this summer.

04:54.894 --> 04:58.798
It will take the district court months
to process charges for felony vandalism,

04:59.065 --> 05:02.502
but the school board only needed two weeks
to process their decision.

05:07.940 --> 05:08.808
Join us.

05:11.344 --> 05:12.545
- Hi, Pat.
- Hi.

05:12.945 --> 05:13.946
- Come on.
- Perfect.

05:14.414 --> 05:15.548
I'm so sorry.

05:16.783 --> 05:18.751
- I didn't do it, Mom.
- I know.

05:19.686 --> 05:24.857
When Dylan does, like, something stupid,
and he does stupid things all the time,

05:24.924 --> 05:28.494
I mean, he usually will...
He admits it to me. I mean...

05:30.997 --> 05:34.100
I could... Well, okay,
so, he doesn't admit it.

05:34.367 --> 05:36.836
He lies to me a lot.
But I can tell when he's lying,

05:36.903 --> 05:38.938
and he knows
that I can tell when he's lying,

05:39.005 --> 05:40.973
so, he knows he can't really lie to me,

05:41.040 --> 05:44.377
because when he looks at me,
and he lies, and I ask him a question,

05:44.444 --> 05:46.813
it's like his ears get red on the top,
so, I know.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.716
So, I don't think that he did it.

05:50.616 --> 05:51.484
Because...

05:56.956 --> 05:57.990
I just don't.

06:06.466 --> 06:08.634
I've personally
known Dylan for two years.

06:08.768 --> 06:10.970
We're part of Hanover High School's
Morning Show.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.705
Hi. Welcome to the Morning Show.

06:12.772 --> 06:15.808
Today is Wednesday,
January 20th, and it is a C day.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.543
My name is Peter Maldonado.

06:17.977 --> 06:20.513
I'm a reporter on the show.
He's a cameraman.

06:20.580 --> 06:21.881
Madison with today's menu.

06:22.515 --> 06:25.051
If I'm being honest,
I can't say I really like Dylan.

06:25.651 --> 06:27.920
Mostly because he's
always doing stuff like this.

06:27.987 --> 06:30.490
...some exciting new additions
to the lunch menu.

06:31.824 --> 06:33.626
Today, we have tacos and meatloaf...

06:33.693 --> 06:37.430
Disruptive, disrespectful,
a history of poor decisions.

06:37.597 --> 06:39.966
You can see
why the school board was convinced

06:40.032 --> 06:42.602
that Dylan was the type of person
to do the dicks.

06:43.002 --> 06:44.003
The label fit.

06:45.171 --> 06:48.141
So, all the school board had to do
was make their case.

06:48.474 --> 06:50.610
And it's a compelling one. It's damning.

06:51.144 --> 06:55.681
The school structured their case
against Dylan using four major points.

07:01.587 --> 07:04.957
Can you tell us where
you were on the afternoon of March 15th?

07:05.591 --> 07:07.960
Sure. Uh, I'd just come back
to pick up some books.

07:08.027 --> 07:12.031
Um, we had a science test next day,
I went to grab them from my locker.

07:12.865 --> 07:15.034
I came out into the parking lot, and...

07:16.469 --> 07:20.440
...I saw Dylan Maxwell
spray-painting the cars.

07:22.842 --> 07:24.844
You are certain that it's Dylan?

07:25.478 --> 07:26.579
Oh, hundred percent.

07:33.753 --> 07:35.555
So, tell me exactly what you saw.

07:36.055 --> 07:38.624
Oh, well, I was coming out
of the school over there.

07:39.659 --> 07:43.729
And I kind of noticed something,
out of the corner of my eye, so, I turned.

07:45.097 --> 07:46.632
That's where I saw him.

07:47.667 --> 07:50.136
And he just went...
Every single car along this row.

07:52.772 --> 07:53.873
Dick.

07:57.577 --> 07:58.711
Dick.

08:02.515 --> 08:03.583
Dick.

08:07.086 --> 08:08.221
Dick.

08:09.155 --> 08:11.123
So, would you say he was frantic about it,

08:11.190 --> 08:13.226
- or going kind of slow, at his own pace?
- No.

08:14.060 --> 08:15.261
He was methodical about it.

08:16.729 --> 08:19.599
That's what was so messed up.
Like he had the whole thing planned out.

08:21.801 --> 08:24.737
There's no way you could've mistaken Dylan
for someone else?

08:24.804 --> 08:26.072
You're positive it was Dylan?

08:26.739 --> 08:29.175
No, it was...
It was definitely Dylan Maxwell.

08:30.276 --> 08:33.946
From the day he came forward,
Alex Trimboli had one story,

08:34.246 --> 08:35.780
a consistent story.

08:35.982 --> 08:39.284
And it made the school board's case
against Dylan clean and simple.

08:39.919 --> 08:42.587
All Dylan had to do
was provide a reliable alibi

08:42.655 --> 08:44.824
to contradict Alex Trimboli.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.193
Dylan's friends were his best bet.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.228
They call themselves the Wayback Boys.

08:49.862 --> 08:53.065
But when it comes to reliability,
they don't exactly fit the bill.

08:54.233 --> 08:55.768
The day after the vandalism,

08:55.835 --> 08:59.238
Vice Principal Keene called in Dylan
and his friends for separate interviews

08:59.305 --> 09:01.641
to see if they could keep
their story straight.

09:02.108 --> 09:02.975
They couldn't.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.217
Okay, great. Have a seat.
So, you know why you're here, right?

09:12.051 --> 09:13.953
Yeah, probably
'cause of the dicks.

09:14.687 --> 09:16.722
So, where were you
yesterday afternoon?

09:17.290 --> 09:20.326
I was at Lucas Wiley's house.
We were prank calling his neighbor.

09:21.127 --> 09:23.095
- Hello?
- Jansen? They're on to you.

09:23.162 --> 09:26.165
You know too much, right?
Especially about 9/11.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.934
And you were there the whole day?

09:28.768 --> 09:32.038
Pretty much. I left for a bit to
go to my girlfriend Mackenzie's house,

09:32.104 --> 09:33.806
but other than that, yeah.

09:34.874 --> 09:36.943
Well, that's not
what your friends said.

09:37.610 --> 09:38.611
What did they say?

09:40.813 --> 09:43.749
So, where were you
yesterday afternoon?

09:43.816 --> 09:45.351
I was at Lucas Wiley's house.

09:45.718 --> 09:47.086
We were making prank calls.

09:47.587 --> 09:48.955
And where was Dylan Maxwell?

09:49.255 --> 09:50.656
He was there with us.

09:51.123 --> 09:53.192
- The whole day?
- Yeah.

09:53.759 --> 09:57.129
I mean, he left for a little bit to go
to Priceless Moments to take a dump.

09:59.231 --> 10:00.700
So, Dylan left?

10:00.766 --> 10:03.970
Yeah.
He shits at Priceless Moments.

10:04.270 --> 10:07.039
It's this antique store
down the street from my house.

10:07.940 --> 10:12.712
He doesn't like my bathroom.
My mom has one of those squishy seats.

10:14.880 --> 10:18.651
Dylan says the squishy
toilet seats are like pressing your butt

10:18.718 --> 10:21.854
against someone else's butt,
and then pooping into their butthole.

10:22.622 --> 10:23.789
Okay, okay.

10:25.625 --> 10:29.061
Mackenzie,
on the afternoon of March 15th,

10:29.128 --> 10:31.931
do you remember where Dylan was?

10:32.098 --> 10:34.767
Yeah, he was, uh,
hanging over at Lucas Wiley's,

10:34.834 --> 10:37.269
and then he came
and dropped off dog food at my place.

10:37.336 --> 10:40.840
Great. Do you remember about what time
he came to drop off the dog food?

10:41.007 --> 10:44.243
Um, like two-ish, 2:10, 2:15.

10:44.310 --> 10:48.080
Okay. Well, sometime... Would you say
sometime between two and 2:30?

10:48.147 --> 10:49.215
- Yeah.
- Okay, great.

10:49.815 --> 10:53.753
Um, do you have any proof
that he was there?

10:54.820 --> 10:56.322
Um...

10:58.124 --> 10:59.058
I saw him.

11:00.826 --> 11:02.161
Okay. Um...

11:02.228 --> 11:05.031
But if Dylan's friends all agree
on Priceless Moments,

11:05.898 --> 11:07.099
why doesn't his girlfriend?

11:08.067 --> 11:08.934
I saw him.

11:09.135 --> 11:10.269
- You saw him.
- Yes.

11:10.903 --> 11:12.772
You say he's at your house.

11:12.972 --> 11:15.141
His friends say he's at an antique store.

11:15.674 --> 11:18.878
And then we have vandalism
at the high school.

11:18.944 --> 11:20.780
All in the same 30-minute period.

11:21.680 --> 11:24.417
So, let's see if we can try
and sort, uh, some of this out.

11:28.154 --> 11:32.191
All right. What I have right now is purple
for theories and yellow for facts.

11:32.258 --> 11:34.894
This is my good friend
and co-producer, Sam Ecklund.

11:35.761 --> 11:36.896
He's really into string.

11:37.897 --> 11:40.266
What bothers me
are these conflicting testimonies.

11:41.400 --> 11:44.837
Dylan and Mackenzie both say
that Dylan was at Mackenzie's house.

11:44.904 --> 11:47.940
The Wayback Boys said he went
to Priceless Moments to take a dump.

11:48.007 --> 11:49.942
He wasn't...
Look. He was lying about both.

11:50.009 --> 11:52.178
He wasn't at either.
He was drawing the dicks.

11:52.845 --> 11:56.816
If Dylan, his girlfriend,
and the Wayback Boys are all lying,

11:56.882 --> 11:57.950
as Sam believes,

11:58.150 --> 12:00.286
then we have a narrative
that's easy to digest.

12:01.087 --> 12:05.091
He wasn't at Mackenzie's house
or taking a dump at Priceless Moments.

12:05.157 --> 12:07.460
Instead, he was at Hanover High School,

12:07.860 --> 12:10.763
and more specifically,
the parking lot of Hanover High School,

12:10.830 --> 12:13.265
to draw the dicks,
as Alex Trimboli claims.

12:13.999 --> 12:16.068
Even if they had gotten
their story straight,

12:16.135 --> 12:18.471
it's not easy to trust Dylan
and his friends.

12:18.737 --> 12:21.073
They call themselves
the Wayback Boys.

12:22.208 --> 12:23.075
So fucking dumb.

12:23.843 --> 12:25.311
- Those guys are idiots.
- Again.

12:25.377 --> 12:27.046
- Let's see.
- Do it again.

12:27.313 --> 12:29.748
I don't know what they said,
but Dylan did it.

12:29.815 --> 12:32.852
The key to this whole thing
is in these conflicting testimonies.

12:33.285 --> 12:36.322
You either trust Alex Trimboli
from the National Honor Society,

12:37.089 --> 12:38.924
or you trust Dylan and his friends,

12:39.058 --> 12:42.194
creators of the YouTube video,
Porta Potty Shit Prank.

12:43.329 --> 12:45.264
So, what's your opinion
on Alex Trimboli?

12:45.331 --> 12:46.899
Fuck Alex Trimboli.

12:47.900 --> 12:48.801
Come on, dude.

12:48.868 --> 12:52.338
There was one of him saying he was there,
and four of us saying he wasn't.

12:52.404 --> 12:56.008
Okay, if Dylan cheated
on a test in school...

12:56.075 --> 13:00.045
...and, um, this teacher was suspicious
of... That somebody had cheated,

13:00.246 --> 13:02.381
would you lie
and say that Dylan did not cheat?

13:03.082 --> 13:03.949
Yeah.

13:04.416 --> 13:06.051
Dude, don't say that.

13:06.152 --> 13:07.319
That doesn't help.

13:07.486 --> 13:08.354
What?

13:08.420 --> 13:11.090
- Say no. Say no.
- Well, I mean, I ain't know that, what?

13:11.157 --> 13:12.791
I would also say, yeah.

13:13.192 --> 13:14.927
- I also feel...
- But that's different.

13:14.994 --> 13:16.428
- School is different than...
- Yeah.

13:16.495 --> 13:18.330
Like, I was with this dude.

13:18.397 --> 13:20.432
This is 100-percent.

13:20.499 --> 13:21.534
He was here.

13:25.171 --> 13:27.173
Remember I said
parking lot security footage

13:27.239 --> 13:29.208
at the time of the vandalism was missing?

13:30.176 --> 13:32.945
This was the school board's
second key point against Dylan.

13:33.245 --> 13:36.415
Because he was one of the nine students
who had access to the footage.

13:36.482 --> 13:41.020
The media server stores the footage
for the Morning Show in one directory...

13:41.086 --> 13:43.189
...and the security footage in the other.

13:43.389 --> 13:45.157
Okay. Awesome. And...

13:45.591 --> 13:49.128
you know,
which students of yours had access

13:49.195 --> 13:51.530
to the media server room
where that's held?

13:51.964 --> 13:54.033
Uh... Nine students:

13:54.433 --> 13:55.401
Uh, Randall Snyder,

13:56.435 --> 13:57.303
Sam Ecklund,

13:58.137 --> 13:59.004
Emily Hershey,

13:59.605 --> 14:00.940
Phil Huang,

14:01.006 --> 14:01.874
Christa Carlyle,

14:02.341 --> 14:03.442
Ming Zhang,

14:03.509 --> 14:04.376
Peter Maldonado,

14:05.044 --> 14:07.279
Madison Kaplan, and Dylan Maxwell.

14:07.413 --> 14:10.149
Dylan often tells me,
the vandal could be anyone.

14:10.883 --> 14:12.484
But that's not entirely true.

14:12.952 --> 14:15.187
Sure, anyone could spray-paint dicks,

14:15.354 --> 14:18.290
but deleting security footage
from the school's private server?

14:18.557 --> 14:21.093
There's only a short list
of people capable of that.

14:21.927 --> 14:23.529
Nine people who could've done it,

14:23.596 --> 14:25.931
or at the very least,
helped the person who did.

14:26.866 --> 14:27.933
Since the vandalism,

14:28.000 --> 14:30.569
I've started referring to them
as the Morning Show Nine.

14:30.936 --> 14:34.206
Nine hundred and fifty-eight students
enrolled in Hanover High, correct?

14:34.273 --> 14:35.975
Yes, 958.

14:36.342 --> 14:38.344
Nine have a key and a login

14:38.410 --> 14:40.546
which gives them access
to the security footage,

14:40.613 --> 14:43.549
and Dylan Maxwell is one of those nine,
correct?

14:43.916 --> 14:44.650
Yeah.

14:45.484 --> 14:46.652
Thank you.

14:52.157 --> 14:54.126
Oh, no, my pencil broke.

14:54.293 --> 14:57.096
Dylan's weak alibi
and media server access

14:57.162 --> 14:59.131
gave him opportunity to draw the dicks.

14:59.198 --> 15:02.001
But his Spanish teacher,
Ms. Shapiro, gave him motive.

15:03.135 --> 15:06.138
She claimed the dicks weren't directed
at a bunch of random teachers.

15:06.205 --> 15:07.306
She was a target.

15:21.387 --> 15:22.254
Dylan.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.624
Dylan, please. Not today.

15:25.691 --> 15:28.460
What? Like,
I like it really, really, really sharp.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.598
- Dylan.
- It's still not sharp.

15:33.098 --> 15:35.200
Did anything happen
between you and Dylan

15:35.267 --> 15:37.636
in the days leading up
that could've contributed to this?

15:37.703 --> 15:41.540
Yes. I had just given him
another week of detention.

15:42.041 --> 15:44.209
So, he must've wanted to get back at me.

15:44.977 --> 15:48.447
He not only spray-painted my car,
he slashed my tire.

15:49.315 --> 15:51.550
Were any of the other teachers'
tires slashed?

15:51.617 --> 15:53.953
- No.
- Yours was the only one?

15:54.253 --> 15:56.388
Yes, mine was the only one.

15:57.022 --> 15:59.325
Twenty-seven dicks on 27 cars.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.293
But only one slashed tire,

16:01.493 --> 16:05.097
on the car of Ms. Shapiro,
the teacher Dylan hated the most.

16:05.564 --> 16:08.267
I gotta say,
this target theory makes sense.

16:08.667 --> 16:11.036
I did not see him slashing the tires.

16:12.571 --> 16:16.375
But it would make sense
that if he slashed the tires

16:16.442 --> 16:19.678
and drew the first dick on her car,
that he would just keep going

16:19.745 --> 16:21.747
until someone like me came out
to stop him.

16:23.382 --> 16:24.550
That's what I think.

16:25.117 --> 16:27.519
This isn't the first time
he's vandalized my vehicle.

16:27.686 --> 16:30.556
Oh, really?
So, he's vandalized your car prior?

16:30.622 --> 16:34.626
Yes. There was an incident
with a changed license plate.

16:34.693 --> 16:37.129
He replaced my license plate frame

16:37.429 --> 16:41.266
with another frame that said,
"I heart boobs."

16:41.700 --> 16:44.103
The fact that he'd pranked her car
in the past

16:44.169 --> 16:46.438
with the "I heart boobs"
license plate frame,

16:46.505 --> 16:50.309
the fact that Shapiro's was the only car
with a slashed tire,

16:50.376 --> 16:53.012
it adds up.
It doesn't look good for Dylan.

16:53.612 --> 16:57.016
But the school board saved
their most damning point for last:

16:57.616 --> 17:01.020
Dylan was a known dick drawer.

17:01.086 --> 17:03.355
Have you ever drawn obscene images

17:03.422 --> 17:06.025
like the ones
that were on the parking lot cars before?

17:07.459 --> 17:08.359
I dabble.

17:09.094 --> 17:12.431
I do a lot of pranks in her class.
Like sometimes I'll just get up and...

17:13.232 --> 17:16.135
just, like, draw a big dick
on the whiteboard.

17:16.702 --> 17:19.271
And then she'll, like, turn around,
and be like...

17:20.406 --> 17:23.575
Like, "Who drew this dick?
Dylan, did you draw this dick?"

17:24.076 --> 17:25.577
And I'd be like, "No."

17:26.545 --> 17:29.181
But I did, and she knows.
Like, she knows I did it.

17:29.248 --> 17:31.817
I mean, yeah, I draw...

17:33.652 --> 17:35.587
a penis from time to time.

17:35.821 --> 17:37.456
- Time to time.
- On a whiteboard.

17:37.523 --> 17:38.424
Once a week?

17:41.126 --> 17:42.761
- Four times a week.
- Four times a week.

17:42.828 --> 17:46.498
He drew these same drawings
on my whiteboard

17:46.698 --> 17:48.567
in my classroom almost every day.

17:49.234 --> 17:52.371
At the hearing, Shapiro talked
at length about these drawings.

17:52.538 --> 17:56.408
Dylan's whiteboard dicks were a major part
of the school board's narrative.

17:56.475 --> 17:59.578
This is just the last three months.

17:59.845 --> 18:02.614
I have two years' worth of photographs.

18:02.681 --> 18:04.683
I can certainly present more to the board.

18:05.317 --> 18:09.088
So, as you can see,
he clearly is the young man

18:09.154 --> 18:11.356
who's been drawing penises
all over campus.

18:11.423 --> 18:13.559
Conflicting
eyewitness testimonies,

18:13.625 --> 18:15.160
access to security footage,

18:15.227 --> 18:18.330
a teacher vendetta,
and a history of dick drawing?

18:18.397 --> 18:21.200
Everything pointed to Dylan,
open-and-shut.

18:21.667 --> 18:25.571
But I discovered one glaring discrepancy
no one was even looking at.

18:25.637 --> 18:29.341
Something so huge,
it could blow the case wide open.

18:33.245 --> 18:34.113
Ball hairs.

18:34.346 --> 18:36.515
- Right.
- I can't believe I never noticed that.

18:36.582 --> 18:38.250
Does that change things for you?

18:40.252 --> 18:41.854
There's gotta be at least one.

18:42.121 --> 18:45.424
No, there's not a single hairless nutsack
on those whiteboards.

18:45.491 --> 18:48.293
I went through every photo,
dating back to the sixth grade.

18:48.360 --> 18:51.130
You're right.
All of the whiteboard dicks look the same.

18:51.196 --> 18:52.164
Yeah.

18:53.799 --> 18:55.868
Maybe, you know,
he didn't have enough time

18:56.135 --> 18:57.402
to draw ball hairs, you know?

18:57.469 --> 18:59.771
He was in a rush,
just went around the parking lot,

18:59.838 --> 19:01.507
- and drew dick.
- Yeah. No, no, no.

19:01.573 --> 19:03.876
I was thinking about that, too,
but take a look at the tips.

19:05.677 --> 19:07.846
- Yeah, way better mushroom heads.
- Exactly.

19:07.913 --> 19:09.281
If you're concerned about time,

19:09.348 --> 19:11.416
why would you spend time
drawing mushrooms?

19:11.483 --> 19:14.386
- Those are difficult and take time.
- I see what you mean, yeah.

19:15.220 --> 19:17.222
I gotta admit, this looks good for Dylan.

19:17.289 --> 19:19.591
Oh, yeah.
This looks really good for Dylan.

19:20.425 --> 19:23.829
The hairs, the tip, the ball size?
They're different.

19:24.463 --> 19:26.532
None of this was mentioned
at Dylan's hearing.

19:26.932 --> 19:28.934
What else did the school board miss?

19:29.201 --> 19:30.569
All right, take a look at this.

19:30.669 --> 19:33.272
These are the dicks that you drew
in Shapiro's class.

19:33.338 --> 19:34.640
- Yeah. Of course.
- Right?

19:34.706 --> 19:38.443
And then this is the dicks
that were drawn on the car.

19:38.510 --> 19:42.347
- Oh, shit, these are totally different.
- Yeah, they're completely different. Yeah.

19:43.248 --> 19:43.949
Wow.

19:44.216 --> 19:46.485
And we checked
every single whiteboard dick

19:46.552 --> 19:49.354
that you drew in Shapiro's class,
all had hairs.

19:50.222 --> 19:52.324
Yeah, I never forget the ball hairs.

19:52.391 --> 19:54.860
It's just...
It's such an important part of the dick.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.895
And, like, the mushroom head's all off.

19:57.563 --> 19:59.831
Mine's way different.
I usually just do, like, a...

20:01.466 --> 20:02.801
- You know?
- The mushroom tip.

20:03.268 --> 20:05.771
They really...
That's like a heart, almost.

20:05.837 --> 20:07.806
They didn't even
bring it up in your case.

20:08.807 --> 20:09.675
This is dope.

20:10.509 --> 20:11.810
This is really dope, right?

20:12.244 --> 20:13.445
Yeah. I think so.

20:25.490 --> 20:28.994
Greg made me get a job working
for fucking Postmates.

20:29.261 --> 20:30.629
Greg is Dylan's stepdad.

20:30.696 --> 20:34.833
Postmates is kind of like pizza delivery,
except it's not pizza.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.603
Well, I mean, sometimes it's pizza,
you can order pizza.

20:37.669 --> 20:40.505
But usually people order,
like, I don't know, random shit.

20:40.572 --> 20:43.976
And a lot of the time,
I want that shit, too.

20:44.810 --> 20:47.012
You know, I gotta buy someone a smoothie,

20:47.446 --> 20:49.915
you know, I'm like...
Obviously I'm gonna get a smoothie.

20:50.882 --> 20:53.752
So, sometimes I lose money on this job.
But whatever.

20:54.453 --> 20:56.588
There's some perks.
You get free fries and shit.

20:56.888 --> 20:59.925
- Oh, can I get one?
- No, if you take too much, they notice.

21:02.427 --> 21:05.264
You know what sucks,
is that if you get charged,

21:05.564 --> 21:09.268
your parents are gonna have
to pay like $100,000.

21:09.334 --> 21:11.303
- Yeah, so...
- And, like, what?

21:11.370 --> 21:14.439
You only make like $10 an hour
at Postmates, so, you do the math.

21:15.540 --> 21:17.576
- Fuck, I'm gonna be here all year.
- Mm-hm.

21:20.712 --> 21:22.914
So, your history with Ms. Shapiro
was a huge part

21:22.981 --> 21:25.050
- of the school board's case, right?
- Dude.

21:25.317 --> 21:26.351
She has it out for me.

21:26.818 --> 21:28.520
It's so wack. Everyone knows.

21:28.587 --> 21:31.890
No, it's true.
I mean, most teachers hate Dylan, like...

21:32.024 --> 21:34.593
But Shapiro, she fucking hates him.

21:34.660 --> 21:37.796
Like, a lot more than that.
Like in a really kind of fucked-up way...

21:37.863 --> 21:40.666
- Like, a lot, dude.
- How much time do you have on your hands

21:40.732 --> 21:42.834
to focus your energy on one kid?

21:42.901 --> 21:46.672
Shapiro did give Dylan
19 detentions this year.

21:46.738 --> 21:50.042
But you guys have to admit
that the fact that her tires were slashed,

21:50.409 --> 21:53.612
she was the first car hit,
that you vandalized her car in the past,

21:53.679 --> 21:55.814
you see how, like, that looks bad for you.

21:55.881 --> 21:58.750
Dude, the license plate thing wasn't me.

21:59.985 --> 22:02.954
I swear to God.
If it was, I would admit it,

22:03.021 --> 22:04.489
because it's fucking funny.

22:04.890 --> 22:06.925
But it... But it wasn't.

22:07.793 --> 22:10.662
Here's the thing.
How could I have vandalized her car

22:11.063 --> 22:12.931
if I don't even know what it looks like?

22:13.832 --> 22:16.501
- For sure.
- It's physically impossible, dude.

22:17.035 --> 22:19.504
Dylan made this point
at the school board hearing,

22:19.571 --> 22:22.607
but ultimately it came down
to his word against hers,

22:22.674 --> 22:24.643
and everyone knew he hated Shapiro.

22:24.710 --> 22:26.978
You're saying
you've never seen Ms. Shapiro's car?

22:27.045 --> 22:28.780
- Never seen her car.
- In your life?

22:28.847 --> 22:29.715
Never, dude.

22:30.515 --> 22:33.952
For all I know,
she could have a beige fucking motorcycle.

22:39.458 --> 22:42.627
School's talking about Dylan
like he's some criminal mastermind. Okay.

22:42.794 --> 22:45.797
They say he deleted the security footage.

22:46.131 --> 22:48.567
Dude, Dylan's too dumb to delete footage.

22:49.534 --> 22:51.403
Yeah, true. I'd never think to do that.

22:51.470 --> 22:53.071
And it's not just thinking about it.

22:53.138 --> 22:56.575
It's, like, how does one go...?
Like, do you know how to delete footage?

22:57.075 --> 22:57.943
Yeah.

22:59.144 --> 23:01.913
- You don't.
- Yeah. You just go into the FTP.

23:02.614 --> 23:04.449
I mean, yeah, but it's very difficult.

23:04.516 --> 23:06.017
Do you know what an FTP is?

23:06.585 --> 23:08.520
- No.
- Exactly.

23:09.721 --> 23:10.856
That's hilarious.

23:11.490 --> 23:14.059
He's saying he's too dumb
to have deleted the footage?

23:14.126 --> 23:14.993
Uh-huh.

23:15.060 --> 23:18.163
That's actually a really good point,
the smartest thing he's ever said.

23:18.430 --> 23:19.898
- So, you are believing it?
- Yeah.

23:20.499 --> 23:22.901
While it's true Dylan was a part
of the Morning Show,

23:22.968 --> 23:25.137
that doesn't mean he's smart enough
to delete the footage

23:25.403 --> 23:26.772
from the school's media server.

23:26.838 --> 23:29.407
He would've had to have known
how to log into the FTP

23:29.474 --> 23:31.076
and navigate to the right directory

23:31.143 --> 23:34.045
that stores the right security camera
at the right time,

23:34.179 --> 23:37.449
pretty complicated for someone
who never pays attention in class.

23:37.883 --> 23:41.419
In fact, the only reason he joined
the Morning Show in the first place

23:41.486 --> 23:45.457
was so he could borrow camera equipment
for his YouTube channel, Wayback Boys TV.

23:48.460 --> 23:50.729
So, tell me a little bit
about the Wayback Boys.

23:50.796 --> 23:51.897
Our shit's dope, man.

23:51.963 --> 23:54.699
We call ourselves the Wayback Boys
'cause we go way back.

23:55.100 --> 24:00.872
But we actually go way-er back
than most people even realize.

24:01.506 --> 24:03.208
We've been doing these videos... Well,

24:03.475 --> 24:08.046
me and Spencer have, since we were,
like, nine or even younger.

24:08.113 --> 24:09.447
Man, I gotta fart.

24:13.819 --> 24:17.522
And it's cool to actually look
at the video, like, the old videos,

24:17.956 --> 24:20.592
compare them to the new videos,
'cause you just watch...

24:20.659 --> 24:22.694
You look at the difference,
you're just like:

24:23.662 --> 24:25.463
"Damn, they got good."

24:27.098 --> 24:33.104
With 29 videos, 5,173 views,
and 358 subscribers,

24:33.471 --> 24:35.740
Dylan's convinced that
they're the next big thing.

24:35.807 --> 24:38.510
- What up? I'm Dylan.
- And I'm Spencer.

24:38.577 --> 24:40.912
- And this is Baby Farting.
- And this is Baby Farting.

24:55.794 --> 24:57.529
Oh, my God,
I almost shit myself.

24:57.829 --> 24:59.064
We keep getting better, man.

24:59.130 --> 25:01.933
Like, you compare Baby Farting 2
to Baby Farting 1...

25:02.567 --> 25:04.803
huge difference in quality.

25:04.870 --> 25:06.972
- What up? I'm Dylan.
- And I'm Lucas.

25:07.105 --> 25:09.040
And this is Dad Pantsing.

25:11.843 --> 25:12.878
His pants are down!

25:12.944 --> 25:14.613
- Fuck!
- Pedophile! Pedophile!

25:15.981 --> 25:19.017
Dylan claims he's not smart enough
to delete the security footage.

25:19.084 --> 25:20.986
But he is technologically savvy enough

25:21.052 --> 25:23.088
to edit and upload his own videos
to YouTube.

25:25.757 --> 25:27.792
So, is he really as dumb as he lets on?

25:31.930 --> 25:33.198
Did you eat the fries?

25:36.167 --> 25:37.035
Yeah.

25:37.769 --> 25:39.604
Personally, I think he is.

25:42.140 --> 25:45.110
The day after the vandalism,
Vice Principal Keene,

25:45.176 --> 25:47.212
he interviewed, uh, Lucas Wiley

25:47.579 --> 25:50.749
and the other two of your friends
who are in the Wayback Boys.

25:50.815 --> 25:52.183
- Right.
- And they said

25:52.284 --> 25:55.053
that on March 15th at two o'clock,

25:55.120 --> 25:57.789
- you did leave the premises.
- Right. Yeah, yeah.

25:57.856 --> 25:59.691
But they say you went

25:59.758 --> 26:03.028
to the Priceless Moments antique store,
and then came back.

26:03.094 --> 26:06.097
- Well...
- You can see why this is tricky for us.

26:06.164 --> 26:11.102
Yeah, no, I told them I was going
to Priceless Moments,

26:11.603 --> 26:13.571
but I went to Mackenzie's house.

26:13.638 --> 26:16.107
- So, you were not at Priceless Moments?
- No.

26:16.174 --> 26:17.976
- You were at Mackenzie's.
- Right.

26:18.043 --> 26:21.046
The Wayback Boys are lying
to Vice Principal Keene.

26:21.112 --> 26:24.316
Well,
they think I was at Priceless Moments.

26:24.582 --> 26:26.818
- Because you lied to them.
- 'Cause I lied to them.

26:26.885 --> 26:28.887
- Okay.
- I wanted to hang out with Mackenzie,

26:28.954 --> 26:31.823
but I didn't want them to be like,
"You're whipped." You know?

26:31.890 --> 26:33.091
We're clear on all of this.

26:34.225 --> 26:35.160
Go poop, Ruff.

26:36.027 --> 26:39.264
Dylan, what's the deal
with the conflicting testimonies?

26:39.331 --> 26:41.032
You were there. You know the truth.

26:41.099 --> 26:42.667
I mean, look. Here's the thing.

26:42.734 --> 26:44.869
I don't talk about Mac
in front of my boys.

26:45.303 --> 26:47.739
And I don't talk about my boys
in front of Mac.

26:48.173 --> 26:50.942
That's why I told them
I was shitting at Priceless Moments.

26:51.009 --> 26:53.211
If I told them I was with Mac,
they'd be like...

26:53.278 --> 26:55.814
Just give me a bunch of shit. You know?

26:55.880 --> 26:58.683
And they believe I'm at Priceless Moments,
because they know

26:58.750 --> 27:01.886
that's where I go to take a shit
when I'm at Lucas' house, you know?

27:01.953 --> 27:03.388
They know I hate Lucas' bathroom.

27:03.655 --> 27:05.857
He's got one of those squishy toilets.
I don't...

27:06.257 --> 27:08.360
Mackenzie fucking sucks.

27:09.094 --> 27:11.196
Dylan is whipped as fuck, dude.

27:11.896 --> 27:13.264
It's, like, problematic.

27:13.898 --> 27:17.002
She could pretty much have
any guy she wants, but she picked me.

27:17.635 --> 27:19.104
And she's, like, hot.

27:19.170 --> 27:21.039
Like, everyone on Twitch is always like:

27:21.639 --> 27:23.975
"That's hot. Like, that girl's hot."
You know?

27:24.376 --> 27:26.778
I don't really know what it is,
to be honest,

27:26.845 --> 27:28.680
but she just makes me feel...

27:31.182 --> 27:32.050
different.

27:33.351 --> 27:35.820
It's kind of weird to say, I guess, but...

27:36.654 --> 27:37.385
I think I love her.

27:39.057 --> 27:40.959
It's just like a crazy thing to say.

27:41.893 --> 27:44.696
But, I mean, obviously,
there's other girls...

27:45.663 --> 27:50.735
that are really hot,
and have nice bodies or whatever.

27:51.236 --> 27:54.039
But... I don't know, man.

27:54.105 --> 27:56.207
The way Mackenzie makes me feel is just...

27:58.009 --> 28:02.781
It just... No other girl
can... make me feel like that.

28:04.816 --> 28:06.951
And she also has, like, a way better ass.

28:08.820 --> 28:09.854
Mac, look, look.

28:10.922 --> 28:12.991
Oh, my God, you're gonna break his neck.

28:13.058 --> 28:14.826
I'm sorry.

28:14.893 --> 28:16.361
- Ruff.
- If we could prove

28:16.428 --> 28:17.295
that you were here

28:17.362 --> 28:20.098
instead of the school parking lot,
we prove Alex Trimboli is lying.

28:20.165 --> 28:22.967
Yeah, but, like,
how do we prove that, you know?

28:23.034 --> 28:25.270
I already told them
to go through my phone, and...

28:25.770 --> 28:28.006
I was like,
"Yo, do some CSI-type stuff, you know?"

28:28.073 --> 28:31.242
Track me,
you'll be able to see that I was here,

28:31.309 --> 28:34.379
"and I wasn't, you know,
in the parking lot."

28:34.446 --> 28:35.313
But they said...

28:36.147 --> 28:38.817
I don't know,
they said they don't have the technology.

28:38.883 --> 28:40.185
Which is actually accurate.

28:40.452 --> 28:42.120
Even when the police get involved,

28:42.187 --> 28:45.090
cell phone records can only put Dylan
in a particular location

28:45.156 --> 28:47.292
if he made or received a phone call.

28:48.159 --> 28:49.027
But he didn't.

28:49.294 --> 28:50.462
Ruff was here.

28:50.729 --> 28:53.932
Ruff was here. Yo, Ruff, tell them.

28:54.833 --> 28:57.168
He knows I'm innocent. Listen to him.

28:57.235 --> 28:58.269
He knows.

28:59.104 --> 29:02.440
Yeah. That's him saying,
"Don't do this to Dylan."

29:03.174 --> 29:06.311
- "Don't do this to Dylan."
- "Don't do this to Dylan. He's innocent."

29:15.820 --> 29:18.256
Like, at first, I didn't...
I mean, I didn't even think

29:18.523 --> 29:20.291
being expelled was gonna be that bad.

29:20.925 --> 29:22.894
Like, I was almost...
I was kind of excited.

29:22.961 --> 29:24.963
I thought I was gonna be able to, like...

29:25.497 --> 29:30.301
just kick it, and go get smoothies,
and skate.

29:30.935 --> 29:32.403
You know, honestly, it's just...

29:33.772 --> 29:37.809
Now that everyone's at school,
and I'm just here...

29:41.880 --> 29:43.481
it's actually kind of lonely.

29:47.418 --> 29:50.021
I gotta work this shit job
for half the day.

29:51.856 --> 29:53.324
The only thing on TV is, like...

29:55.160 --> 29:56.060
Ellen...

29:57.395 --> 29:59.264
Wendy, Tyra...

30:00.298 --> 30:03.835
all those fucking first-name shows.

30:04.469 --> 30:05.370
Maury.

30:08.339 --> 30:10.875
It's just not the way
I thought things were gonna go.

30:10.942 --> 30:13.411
You know,
I was gonna graduate high school...

30:14.445 --> 30:17.982
go to Boulder with Mackenzie in the fall,
get my degree in, like...

30:18.516 --> 30:21.119
engineering or some shit,
and then move up north,

30:21.186 --> 30:22.420
work at a snowboard shop.

30:23.221 --> 30:27.091
I mean, at this point,
best-case scenario is

30:27.158 --> 30:29.160
me and Mackenzie do long-distance.

30:29.227 --> 30:34.165
But, I mean, that basically just means
I have to jerk myself off... every night.

30:38.336 --> 30:41.072
I mean, honestly,
she'd probably just break up with me.

30:43.575 --> 30:46.177
So, I would still have
to jerk myself off every night.

30:48.246 --> 30:50.315
Either way,
I'm gonna have to jerk off myself.

30:51.349 --> 30:53.618
I mean, I guess the worst part
of this whole thing

30:53.918 --> 30:55.386
is just the fact that, like...

30:56.855 --> 30:58.022
I know I didn't do it.

31:00.525 --> 31:03.394
You know? Like, I didn't fucking do it.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.031
But everyone is talking about me
like I did.

31:08.032 --> 31:09.200
Like, everyone.

31:12.437 --> 31:15.139
And I'm not even there, you know?

31:16.241 --> 31:19.644
I can't even, like, defend myself.

31:20.245 --> 31:21.546
Dylan Maxwell, no question.

31:21.613 --> 31:23.548
He's, like, a known dick drawer.

31:23.615 --> 31:25.483
Ball hairs? Who cares?

31:25.550 --> 31:28.453
Parking lot dicks could have two nutsacks
and warts,

31:28.519 --> 31:30.255
and... it doesn't even matter.

31:30.321 --> 31:34.125
I don't think he was even gonna graduate.
Who gives a shit about Dylan Maxwell?

31:34.192 --> 31:36.461
Yeah, I wouldn't trust anything
that Dylan says.

31:37.362 --> 31:40.899
But then again, I wouldn't trust anything
that Alex Trimboli says, either.

31:41.266 --> 31:42.133
Why not?

31:42.333 --> 31:46.271
For starters, he said he got to third base
with Sara Pearson at summer camp.

31:46.938 --> 31:48.139
Wait, what?

31:51.476 --> 31:55.113
As you can tell from my reaction,
this news is a little bit shocking.

31:55.613 --> 31:59.450
Alex Trimboli claims he got a hand job
from Sara Pearson?

32:00.018 --> 32:03.154
Sara Pearson has hooked up
with Michael Polowski,

32:03.388 --> 32:06.591
Brad Cormack, Scott Winter.

32:07.125 --> 32:09.360
And then she hooks up with Alex Trimboli?

32:09.994 --> 32:11.596
Sara Pearson? Like, no way, dude.

32:11.663 --> 32:13.998
Have you seen Alex?
And have you seen Sara?

32:14.065 --> 32:17.402
There is no way Alex got a hand job
from Sara.

32:17.468 --> 32:19.938
She's... kind of top-notch.

32:20.004 --> 32:21.706
Sara Pearson is so hot.

32:21.973 --> 32:23.274
She used to date Scott Winter.

32:23.574 --> 32:26.277
Scott... Sara.

32:27.245 --> 32:28.613
- Alex.
- No.

32:30.648 --> 32:31.516
Alex.

32:31.582 --> 32:35.086
With only circumstantial evidence
tying him to the vandalism,

32:35.219 --> 32:38.056
the school board built its entire case
against Dylan

32:38.122 --> 32:41.125
on the back of Alex Trimboli's
eyewitness testimony.

32:41.359 --> 32:44.562
Yes, they had his whiteboard dicks,
Shapiro's tire,

32:44.629 --> 32:47.999
and the media server,
but Trimboli was their star.

32:48.399 --> 32:51.636
While Dylan spends his days
delivering diapers and french fries,

32:51.970 --> 32:54.973
robbed of his senior year,
and potentially college,

32:55.206 --> 32:57.208
Trimboli walks the halls like a hero.

32:57.675 --> 32:59.344
But what if we can't trust him?

32:59.711 --> 33:01.145
What if he's not as reliable

33:01.212 --> 33:03.281
as the school board would have you
to believe?

33:03.348 --> 33:05.483
What if he's a liar?

33:07.085 --> 33:08.119
So, Alex, tell me.

33:09.387 --> 33:11.322
Did you get a hand job
from Sara Pearson?
