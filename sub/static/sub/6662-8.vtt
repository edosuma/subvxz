WEBVTT

00:05.380 --> 00:06.790
My name is Bridget.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.380
I witnessed a murder.

00:08.420 --> 00:10.550
Just get up on the stand and
tell the judge what you saw,

00:10.590 --> 00:13.050
and we'll protect you.
<b></b>
You don't get it.

00:13.090 --> 00:16.180
Bodaway wants me dead,
I'm dead.

00:16.220 --> 00:19.470
BRIDGET: I ran to my sister
Siobhan for help.

00:19.510 --> 00:21.470
Siobhan? Siobhan!

00:21.520 --> 00:24.690
Siobhan killed herself,
and I assumed her identity.

00:24.730 --> 00:25.810
It was so easy.

00:25.850 --> 00:27.810
I saw a way out, and I took it.

00:27.860 --> 00:29.360
They all think that I'm her.

00:29.400 --> 00:30.650
Her husband.

00:30.690 --> 00:32.110
The doctor's gonna check
on the baby.

00:32.150 --> 00:33.110
What?

00:33.150 --> 00:34.360
Her stepdaughter.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.820
Siobhan has a twin sister.

00:36.870 --> 00:37.910
JULIET:
Oh, God.

00:37.950 --> 00:39.120
There's two of them?

00:39.160 --> 00:41.370
Her lover.
<b></b>
That baby is ours.

00:41.410 --> 00:42.370
Her best friend.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.040
It's ridiculous.

00:44.080 --> 00:45.710
Aren't you supposed to be
pregnant, for crying out loud?

00:45.750 --> 00:47.830
The only person I can trust.

00:47.880 --> 00:49.920
I know you've been
in contact with Mr. Ward.

00:49.960 --> 00:51.090
Well, he called me a few times.

00:51.130 --> 00:52.760
He was concerned about Bridget.

00:52.800 --> 00:54.760
Well, now there's reason
to be concerned about him.

00:54.800 --> 00:56.130
He's missing.

00:56.180 --> 00:58.430
MAN (over phone):
Siobhan, we have a problem.

00:58.470 --> 00:59.510
Bridget's still alive.

01:01.640 --> 01:03.640
(siren wailing)

01:24.620 --> 01:26.620
Relax. The first ultrasound's

01:26.660 --> 01:29.420
always hard
to read.

01:29.460 --> 01:33.170
Baby is no bigger
than a bean.

01:33.210 --> 01:35.050
How's your head?

01:35.090 --> 01:37.090
Sore.

01:37.130 --> 01:39.340
Any idea why she fainted?

01:39.390 --> 01:41.810
Vasovagal is the
likely culprit.

01:41.850 --> 01:44.180
She was in a hot,
crowded environment.

01:44.220 --> 01:46.390
That's all
it takes.

01:46.430 --> 01:47.600
Will you shift to
the left, please?

01:53.230 --> 01:54.900
Everything OK?

01:54.940 --> 01:58.910
Well, I'm not
seeing anything.

01:58.950 --> 02:00.700
What do you mean?

02:00.740 --> 02:03.030
I, uh,

02:03.080 --> 02:05.910
I don't see a baby.

02:05.950 --> 02:09.120
But I, uh, I-I thought
this was a precaution.

02:09.170 --> 02:11.580
The nurses assured me
my wife was fine.

02:11.630 --> 02:13.340
I had some bleeding last week.

02:13.380 --> 02:15.170
What?

02:15.210 --> 02:16.920
Why didn't you say something?

02:16.970 --> 02:19.090
I didn't want
you to worry.

02:19.130 --> 02:21.800
I-I thought
that spotting was normal.

02:21.850 --> 02:23.470
It can be.

02:23.510 --> 02:26.430
Doctor, please, what happened?

02:26.470 --> 02:27.770
I can't be
certain.

02:27.810 --> 02:29.270
But my guess?

02:29.310 --> 02:31.060
An ectopic
pregnancy.

02:31.100 --> 02:33.520
It's when the embryo
is implanted outside
the uterus,

02:33.570 --> 02:35.980
and they're
rarely viable.

02:36.030 --> 02:38.030
So, uh, my wife is no longer...

02:38.070 --> 02:39.990
No longer
pregnant.

02:40.030 --> 02:42.570
(removing gloves)

02:42.620 --> 02:44.950
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

02:44.990 --> 02:45.990
I'll give you
a few minutes.

02:50.540 --> 02:51.540
I can't believe this.

03:05.140 --> 03:07.270
I'm really sorry.

03:07.310 --> 03:10.020
You have nothing
to be sorry about.

03:10.060 --> 03:11.060
This isn't
your fault.

03:11.100 --> 03:13.440
You know
that, right?

03:13.480 --> 03:14.770
I'm just glad
that you're OK.

03:18.400 --> 03:19.400
I made you some tea.

03:20.650 --> 03:21.650
Thank you.

03:26.780 --> 03:29.370
Does it hurt?

03:29.410 --> 03:30.370
No.

03:32.830 --> 03:34.500
What does it feel like?

03:37.380 --> 03:39.210
It doesn't feel
like anything...

03:41.260 --> 03:42.760
except sad.

03:52.190 --> 03:57.150
Look, why don't we let
Siobhan get some rest?

03:57.190 --> 03:59.900
And you let us know
if you need anything.

03:59.940 --> 04:00.940
OK.

04:03.820 --> 04:05.110
(phone ringing)

04:15.750 --> 04:17.590
Hey, Bridge, it's Malcolm.

04:17.630 --> 04:20.670
I'm at the Motor Inn
on 95th, room 610.

04:20.710 --> 04:21.880
I need to see you.

04:49.740 --> 04:51.240
I thought
you were dead.

04:51.290 --> 04:53.250
I thought
I was, too.

04:53.290 --> 04:54.580
What happened?

04:56.210 --> 04:58.380
I just spent
the last week

04:58.420 --> 05:00.340
tied up
in Bodaway's basement.

05:00.380 --> 05:02.460
He's looking
for you, Bridge,

05:02.510 --> 05:03.880
and when I didn't tell
him where you were...

05:06.930 --> 05:09.300
I'm so sorry.

05:09.350 --> 05:10.510
How did you get away?

05:10.560 --> 05:11.850
I shook him

05:11.890 --> 05:14.730
after I made him believe
you were in Seattle.

05:14.770 --> 05:17.810
Made it here in one piece...
for the most part.

05:21.570 --> 05:22.690
Don't worry.

05:22.730 --> 05:23.990
He didn't follow me.

05:24.030 --> 05:25.650
I was careful.

05:25.700 --> 05:28.610
I'm only worried
about you.

05:28.660 --> 05:30.700
I still can't believe
that you're here.

05:30.740 --> 05:32.200
Yeah, well, I'm not
planning on staying,

05:32.240 --> 05:33.540
and neither
should you.

05:33.580 --> 05:34.700
It's just as dangerous
in New York.

05:34.750 --> 05:36.540
We got to get
the hell out of here.

05:36.580 --> 05:39.960
I, I can't just
leave right now.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.040
Why not?

05:43.170 --> 05:45.550
'Cause I sort of threw
Bridget under the bus.

05:47.970 --> 05:50.970
I made the cops think
that she was somehow involved

05:51.010 --> 05:52.720
in Gemma's disappearance.

05:52.760 --> 05:54.060
Why the hell
would you do that?

05:54.100 --> 05:56.270
I didn't really
have a choice.

05:56.310 --> 05:58.690
That was the only thing
that I could think of.

05:58.730 --> 06:01.440
I'm sorry, I-I didn't mean to
get you messed up in all this.

06:01.480 --> 06:03.480
Well, I am.

06:06.240 --> 06:09.570
You can't stay here.
This place isn't safe.

06:09.610 --> 06:11.240
There's a hotel
right by the apartment.

06:11.280 --> 06:12.660
I can get you
moved in tonight

06:12.700 --> 06:14.040
and still make it home
before Andrew wakes up.

06:14.080 --> 06:15.750
You should just go.

06:15.790 --> 06:18.000
But...you don't even know
where you're going.

06:24.920 --> 06:25.880
I'll figure it out.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.090
Are you sure you're OK?

06:30.130 --> 06:33.010
Bridget, I just
traveled 2,000 miles

06:33.050 --> 06:35.680
after getting my
ass handed to me.

06:35.720 --> 06:36.680
Cut me some slack, OK?

06:39.850 --> 06:44.150
Sorry, um, I was just
worried about you.

06:44.190 --> 06:45.820
I'll, uh, I'll call you
in the morning?

06:45.860 --> 06:46.940
I grabbed this
before I left.

06:49.820 --> 06:51.740
It's your
six-monther.

06:51.780 --> 06:54.080
Thought you'd want it...

06:54.120 --> 06:55.410
so you don't forget
who you are.

07:03.250 --> 07:04.920
(door opens)

07:04.960 --> 07:05.920
(door closes)

07:43.790 --> 07:45.540
MALCOLM:
My name is Malcolm,

07:45.590 --> 07:47.000
and I'm an addict.

07:47.040 --> 07:49.920
THE GROUP:
Hi, Malcolm.

07:49.960 --> 07:53.090
Those words
come easy now.

07:53.130 --> 07:56.430
Took me a while
to get there, though.

07:56.470 --> 07:59.600
I had to hit
bottom first.

07:59.640 --> 08:00.890
We all did, right?

08:00.930 --> 08:01.890
Yeah.

08:01.930 --> 08:03.640
Sure did.

08:03.690 --> 08:04.850
We have a new face
here today.

08:07.060 --> 08:08.020
Feel like sharing?

08:14.200 --> 08:15.160
I'm good.

08:18.370 --> 08:22.120
Felix, want to lead us
in the Serenity Prayer?

08:22.160 --> 08:24.920
(knocking)
ANDREW:
Shiv?

08:24.960 --> 08:26.960
Everything all right?

08:27.000 --> 08:28.210
Yeah, I'll be right there.

08:34.550 --> 08:36.510
You don't have to
worry about me.

08:36.550 --> 08:38.050
I'm OK.

08:38.100 --> 08:41.270
I took the day off
so we could spend it together.

08:41.310 --> 08:43.480
I have a follow-up
doctor's appointment.

08:43.520 --> 08:45.850
So I'll come with you.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.480
I'd rather go alone.

08:47.520 --> 08:49.610
We should be together
at a time like this.

08:51.480 --> 08:53.990
I appreciate that,
I-I really do.

08:54.030 --> 08:56.160
Um, I just feel like
this is something

08:56.200 --> 08:58.450
I want to do by myself.

08:58.490 --> 08:59.660
Fine.

08:59.700 --> 09:00.660
I'll see you later.

09:04.290 --> 09:05.830
MR. CARPENTER:
All right,

09:05.870 --> 09:07.920
we'll finish up
with an easy one.

09:07.960 --> 09:09.250
What did the rabbits represent?

09:13.760 --> 09:15.510
Seriously? Anyone?

09:20.010 --> 09:21.930
Yes.

09:21.970 --> 09:25.310
The rabbits represent
happiness for Lennie?

09:25.350 --> 09:26.980
He likes soft things,
and the rabbits' fur is soft,

09:27.020 --> 09:31.110
so, you know,
they make him happy.

09:31.150 --> 09:33.480
Very good, Juliet.

09:33.530 --> 09:35.820
Now, for tomorrow...

09:35.860 --> 09:39.030
Rich Girl scores
some brownie points.

09:39.070 --> 09:41.410
Way to go, Rich Girl.

09:41.450 --> 09:43.160
Course, Rich Girl's daddy
probably pays somebody

09:43.200 --> 09:45.040
to read to her
every night.

09:45.080 --> 09:46.370
We tried to
hire your mom,

09:46.410 --> 09:48.500
but she couldn't
handle the big words.

09:48.540 --> 09:50.460
(laughter)

09:50.500 --> 09:51.920
MR. CARPENTER:
Don't tell me, ladies...

09:51.960 --> 09:53.420
you find the book
so enriching,

09:53.460 --> 09:55.380
you can't help but discuss
it amongst yourselves?

09:55.420 --> 09:57.010
(bell ringing)

09:57.050 --> 09:58.680
BOY:
Oh, cool, finally.

09:58.720 --> 10:00.260
(indistinct chatter)

10:00.300 --> 10:02.260
(overlapping chatter)

10:07.140 --> 10:09.980
Um...

10:10.020 --> 10:11.730
could you please
do something about Tessa?

10:11.770 --> 10:14.530
It's-It's like she finds
some sort of sick pleasure

10:14.570 --> 10:16.110
in torturing me.

10:16.150 --> 10:17.110
I'll talk to her.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.570
No disrespect, Mr. C,

10:18.610 --> 10:21.530
but I don't think her
getting a talking to...

10:21.570 --> 10:22.030
I said I'll take care of it.

10:25.830 --> 10:27.460
It's just been a tough week
for me.

10:29.540 --> 10:33.670
I'm not getting my trust fund
till I'm, like, 25.

10:33.710 --> 10:36.130
Is that because of your
little fender bender?

10:36.170 --> 10:38.470
Yeah, and something really bad
happened to my stepmom.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.800
She had a miscarriage.

10:43.850 --> 10:46.470
I'm sorry to hear that.

10:46.520 --> 10:47.770
If you need to
talk to someone

10:47.810 --> 10:49.060
in the guidance
counselor's office...

10:51.730 --> 10:52.860
What if I want to
talk to you?

10:55.400 --> 10:57.150
There's a revival theater

10:57.190 --> 11:00.400
in the Village that's showing
"Of Mice and Men" this weekend.

11:00.450 --> 11:02.740
The original...
with Burgess Meredith.

11:02.780 --> 11:04.370
I have the DVD.

11:04.410 --> 11:06.660
Really?

11:06.700 --> 11:08.450
Maybe I could come over
and watch it sometime?

11:11.170 --> 11:13.960
You're going to be late
for your next class.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.960
(bell ringing)

11:18.960 --> 11:20.090
Yeah.

11:22.130 --> 11:23.220
(scoffs)

11:24.930 --> 11:27.060
ANDREW: I fired the head of
European Operations.

11:27.100 --> 11:30.480
Oh. Good morning
to you, too.

11:30.520 --> 11:34.520
I had Henri Jeunet
escorted out by security.

11:34.560 --> 11:36.570
Mon Dieu!

11:36.610 --> 11:38.230
It's not funny.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.240
Well, what on earth
did Mr. Jeunet do?

11:40.280 --> 11:43.110
When I was in Paris, we had an
amazing dinner at Chez Julien

11:43.160 --> 11:45.990
and he showed me 20% returns.

11:46.030 --> 11:48.870
He lost transfer documents
with my signature on them.

11:48.910 --> 11:50.200
He's blaming it
on his subordinates,

11:50.250 --> 11:51.960
but I think he's lying.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.040
So, what are we going to do?

11:54.080 --> 11:55.710
Don't worry.

11:55.750 --> 11:58.500
I'm taking care of it.

11:58.550 --> 12:00.170
Is something else
bothering you?

12:05.180 --> 12:06.050
Siobhan lost the baby.

12:09.970 --> 12:10.430
Oh, God.

12:12.520 --> 12:17.020
Oh, Andrew, I'm-I'm...
I'm so sorry.

12:17.060 --> 12:18.230
You should

12:18.270 --> 12:21.110
go home and-and be
with her.

12:21.150 --> 12:24.160
I offered,
but she wasn't interested.

12:24.200 --> 12:28.160
I...I guess she's dealing
with it in her own way.

12:28.200 --> 12:30.870
And how are you
dealing with it?

12:30.910 --> 12:33.160
I don't know.

12:33.210 --> 12:34.540
(sighing):
I guess we were pretty set

12:34.580 --> 12:38.130
on not having kids, but...

12:38.170 --> 12:41.960
since Shiv found out
she was pregnant, I was...

12:42.010 --> 12:44.630
I was starting to warm up
to the idea.

12:44.680 --> 12:45.630
Can't you try again?

12:47.720 --> 12:48.680
That's a very good question.

12:50.680 --> 12:52.640

12:58.770 --> 13:02.110

in the shadows ♪

13:02.150 --> 13:05.490

13:13.870 --> 13:16.370
(phone ringing)

13:16.420 --> 13:17.370
Hello?

13:17.420 --> 13:18.790
HENRY:
Hi, Juliet.

13:18.830 --> 13:21.340
Oh, hey, Mr. Butler.
You, uh, looking for my dad?

13:21.380 --> 13:24.010
Uh, no. Your stepmom, actually.
Is she around?

13:24.050 --> 13:27.050
Oh, no. I think my dad said
she had a doctor's appointment.

13:27.090 --> 13:30.050
Right, right, right,
first ultrasound.

13:30.100 --> 13:32.220
Oh, I guess you didn't hear.

13:32.260 --> 13:33.350
Siobhan lost the baby.

13:40.610 --> 13:44.240
I spent 3 hours
in JFK long-term parking.

13:44.280 --> 13:46.110
I found a few hairs
that probably belong to her,

13:46.150 --> 13:47.610
but little else.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.410
(echoing):
I'm sorry, I don't think

13:49.450 --> 13:51.990
(slowly fading out): Gemma's car
is the key to finding her...

13:52.030 --> 13:53.200
(no voice)

13:56.960 --> 14:00.210
MALCOLM:
It's Bridget, right?

14:00.250 --> 14:02.880
How long have
you been clean?

14:02.920 --> 14:04.130
What time is it?

14:04.170 --> 14:06.720
Hey. You're here.

14:06.760 --> 14:09.340
That's all that counts.

14:09.390 --> 14:11.180
I'm here because I have to be,

14:11.220 --> 14:13.600
not because I want to be.

14:13.640 --> 14:16.310
Fair enough.

14:16.350 --> 14:18.310
So what's your poison?

14:18.350 --> 14:21.230
Mine was heroin.

14:21.270 --> 14:24.530
Crushing and snorting.

14:24.570 --> 14:26.360
Creative.

14:26.400 --> 14:27.400
I don't like needles.

14:29.110 --> 14:33.280
Listen, Bridget, I see
a lot of myself in you.

14:33.330 --> 14:35.330
I had a tough
time opening up.

14:35.370 --> 14:37.500
And I can help
you through it.

14:37.540 --> 14:39.040
(sighs)
If I didn't know any better,

14:39.080 --> 14:40.670
I'd think you were offering
to be my sponsor.

14:43.130 --> 14:44.750
Hi.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.720
Are you with me here?

14:47.760 --> 14:49.680
I'm sorry.

14:49.720 --> 14:52.720
My old sponsor's in town.

14:52.760 --> 14:55.100
Oh. All right, yeah,
and you just wanted

14:55.140 --> 14:56.720
to tell me
that you're shaking me loose?

14:56.770 --> 14:57.810
No.

14:57.850 --> 14:58.810
Not at all.

14:58.850 --> 15:01.060
I like what we have.

15:01.100 --> 15:02.940
Good.

15:02.980 --> 15:04.150
You made me nervous there
for a minute.

15:04.190 --> 15:06.650
You had that
"I want to break up" face.

15:06.690 --> 15:08.900
No, no breakup, I promise.

15:08.940 --> 15:11.860
I'm just a little stressed.

15:11.910 --> 15:16.160
Having Malcolm here could...
complicate things.

15:16.200 --> 15:18.200
How so?

15:18.250 --> 15:20.960
I just...I'm dealing
with a lot right now.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.080
Not just Gemma.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.540
My husband and I are, um...

15:24.590 --> 15:27.420
(clears throat)
...going through some stuff.

15:27.460 --> 15:31.090
Ah. And Malcolm
doesn't understand?

15:31.130 --> 15:32.800
It's not that. I...

15:32.840 --> 15:35.850
I want to be there
for both of them.

15:35.890 --> 15:37.060
OK.

15:37.100 --> 15:39.930
Hey, just be honest
with these guys.

15:39.980 --> 15:42.190
Like you've been
honest with me.

15:42.230 --> 15:44.190
Remember, if
you come clean...

15:44.230 --> 15:45.940
You stay clean.
Yeah.

15:45.980 --> 15:47.480
Yeah. Thank you. I mean it.

15:49.110 --> 15:51.450
OK, I gotta go.

15:51.490 --> 15:52.450
Bye.

15:57.660 --> 15:59.750
(phone beeps on)

15:59.790 --> 16:00.830
(beep)

16:02.540 --> 16:04.500
(phone ringing)

16:07.460 --> 16:08.960
(ringing continues)

16:09.000 --> 16:10.090
Yeah?

16:10.130 --> 16:11.880
Malcolm Ward is
in New York City.

16:11.920 --> 16:13.010
Does Bridget know?

16:13.050 --> 16:14.840
She's the one who told me.

16:14.890 --> 16:15.970
What is he doing there?

16:16.010 --> 16:17.430
Don't know yet.

16:17.470 --> 16:20.020
I'm trying to pace myself
with the questions.

16:20.060 --> 16:22.690
I want to be supportive,
not intrusive.

16:22.730 --> 16:25.020
Just following
the sponsor guidelines.

16:25.060 --> 16:26.940
Just make sure
he doesn't mess things up.

16:26.980 --> 16:28.900
Just so you know,

16:28.940 --> 16:31.490
I'm gonna take a different
approach with this guy.

16:31.530 --> 16:33.530
The Gemma thing got way
out of hand.

16:33.570 --> 16:34.990
When I signed on to this job,

16:35.030 --> 16:36.280
I didn't know
that you were gonna make me...

16:36.320 --> 16:37.910
Spare me the details.

16:37.950 --> 16:39.280
I've spent
the last few weeks listening

16:39.330 --> 16:41.000
to a man complain
about his job.

16:41.040 --> 16:42.620
I don't need to do it
long distance.

16:42.660 --> 16:46.830
(door opens)
<b></b>
I got to go. Just...
take care of it.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.750
TYLER: All right, Cora, I'm
gonna ask one more time,

16:48.790 --> 16:50.300
and then I promise
I will shut up.

16:50.340 --> 16:53.170
Are you sure you don't want
to go with me to Rome?

16:53.220 --> 16:55.300
I mean,
the company's paying.

16:55.340 --> 16:57.390
I think I need to see
a little bit of Paris

16:57.430 --> 16:59.470
before I start on Rome.

16:59.510 --> 17:02.430
Hey, it's not my fault we
never leave the hotel room.

17:02.470 --> 17:03.810
Oh, but it is.

17:06.940 --> 17:09.610
Mmm. I feel like I would
just be a distraction.

17:09.650 --> 17:12.150
You need to concentrate
on work.

17:12.190 --> 17:14.190
And why would you say that?

17:14.240 --> 17:15.240
(laughs)

17:17.030 --> 17:18.780
You need to go get dressed.

17:18.820 --> 17:20.950
You don't want
to miss your plane.

17:20.990 --> 17:21.950
Fine.

17:31.710 --> 17:32.670
(sighs)

17:42.310 --> 17:44.270
(horns honking)

17:48.560 --> 17:50.690
(phone ringing)

17:50.730 --> 17:51.820
This is Tyler.

17:51.860 --> 17:53.570
WOMAN:
Please hold for Mr. Martin.

17:53.610 --> 17:55.860
Tyler. Andrew Martin.

17:55.900 --> 17:57.400
Uh, hello, sir.

17:57.450 --> 17:59.240
Oh, what can I do for you?

17:59.280 --> 18:00.660
I just wanted to let you know

18:00.700 --> 18:04.500
that Mr. Jeunet is no longer
with Martin/Charles.

18:04.540 --> 18:06.040
Oh. Wow.

18:06.080 --> 18:08.710
I just talked
to him last night.

18:08.750 --> 18:10.830
I'm so sorry to hear that.

18:10.880 --> 18:11.920
Me, too.

18:11.960 --> 18:13.750
So, what can I help you with?

18:13.800 --> 18:15.380
I wanted to talk to you
about replacing him

18:15.420 --> 18:19.130
as Head of European Operations.

18:19.180 --> 18:20.510
Really?

18:20.550 --> 18:21.550
(laughs)

18:21.600 --> 18:22.850
Well, then I'm not so sorry.

18:22.890 --> 18:24.180
(laughs)

18:24.220 --> 18:25.720
Look, I know you're set
to fly to Rome,

18:25.770 --> 18:28.140
but how about changing
your flight to New York?

18:28.190 --> 18:30.400
I'd love to discuss
this in person.

18:30.440 --> 18:32.230
Oh, I'd like that, too, sir.

18:32.270 --> 18:33.230
Excellent.

18:37.900 --> 18:38.950
(elevator bell dings)

18:46.870 --> 18:47.830
Hey.

18:51.540 --> 18:53.500
Hi.

18:53.540 --> 18:54.710
Is Andrew home?

18:54.750 --> 18:57.510
Uh, no. He's still at work.

18:57.550 --> 18:59.470
Is everything OK?

18:59.510 --> 19:02.340
I called earlier, um,

19:02.390 --> 19:06.640
to see if your guy
found anything in Gemma's car.

19:06.680 --> 19:08.270
He didn't.

19:08.310 --> 19:10.100
But we're not giving up.
I want you to know that.

19:13.650 --> 19:14.820
Juliet told me
about the baby.

19:18.860 --> 19:22.240
(sighs)
I'm sorry.

19:22.280 --> 19:25.530
I didn't mean for you
to find out that way.

19:25.580 --> 19:26.540
Well, I did.

19:29.330 --> 19:31.920
You must be relieved?

19:31.960 --> 19:33.540
Why would you say that?

19:33.580 --> 19:36.880
Well, because it ties everything
up in a nice, little bow.

19:36.920 --> 19:39.210
You know, problem solved.

19:39.260 --> 19:40.970
That's a really
ugly thing to say.

19:41.010 --> 19:42.510
Why?

19:42.550 --> 19:44.180
It's the truth, Siobhan.

19:46.510 --> 19:49.350
You know, I guess
I should be grateful.

19:49.390 --> 19:50.560
For what?

19:50.600 --> 19:51.640
Closure.

19:51.690 --> 19:52.640
Henry, we said

19:52.690 --> 19:55.520
good-bye at the beach.

19:55.560 --> 19:58.360
I thought you let me go.

19:58.400 --> 20:01.150
Yeah.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.160
I just thought that, deep down,
when you had our baby,

20:04.200 --> 20:05.620
it might make you change
your mind.

20:08.290 --> 20:11.580
But without it...

20:11.620 --> 20:12.620
it is over.

20:16.380 --> 20:17.340
(elevator bell dings)

20:17.380 --> 20:19.340
(siren wailing in distance)

20:22.380 --> 20:25.590
ANNOUNCER: ...there for years!
What you need is Mighty Saw!

20:25.640 --> 20:29.350
The fastest, easiest way
to cut, trim, prune, and clear.

20:29.390 --> 20:30.560
(phone ringing)

20:30.600 --> 20:31.930
Just wrap it around,
pull it through,

20:31.980 --> 20:34.100
and Mighty Saw does
the cutting for you.

20:34.140 --> 20:36.230
(knocking on door)

20:36.270 --> 20:37.310
What do you want?

20:40.570 --> 20:41.610
NYPD.

20:46.990 --> 20:48.620
Lot of people been
looking for you,
Mr. Ward.

20:56.080 --> 20:58.750
Cops found this on you.

20:58.790 --> 21:00.880
I-I thought you had
this beat, man.

21:00.920 --> 21:03.630
What happened?

21:03.670 --> 21:06.680
We've known each other,
what, 7 months now?

21:06.720 --> 21:09.680
You've been nothing but
honest and reliable, and...

21:09.720 --> 21:12.810
a dependable sponsor--
and now you're skipping town

21:12.850 --> 21:16.060
and getting high?

21:16.100 --> 21:17.650
By the way, if you
really want to stay hidden,

21:17.690 --> 21:20.610
don't pay for your motel
with a credit card.

21:20.650 --> 21:22.650
And who would I be hiding from,
Agent Machado?

21:22.690 --> 21:26.150
Well, I don't know,
Bodaway Macawi, maybe?

21:26.200 --> 21:29.120
He's responsible for
the way you look, right?

21:29.160 --> 21:30.580
He beat you...

21:30.620 --> 21:32.200
till you told him
where Bridget is.

21:32.240 --> 21:33.700
I don't know
where Bridget is.

21:33.750 --> 21:36.040
Malcolm, if that's what
happened, just tell me.

21:36.080 --> 21:37.290
You know me.

21:37.330 --> 21:38.920
You can trust me.

21:38.960 --> 21:40.340
If you tell me
what you know,

21:40.380 --> 21:43.300
there's a chance we
could put this guy away.

21:43.340 --> 21:45.220
And who'd believe me?

21:45.260 --> 21:47.010
I'm a drug addict.

21:47.050 --> 21:48.800
There's no evidence
against Bodaway.

21:48.840 --> 21:51.760
My word against his.
<b></b>
You're looking for Bridget
in New York.

21:51.810 --> 21:54.560
You can at least admit that.

21:54.600 --> 21:58.690
I knew Bridget
hooked up with her sister.

21:58.730 --> 22:00.270
But now she's gone.

22:00.310 --> 22:02.980
I can't find her.
No one can.

22:03.030 --> 22:04.530
You know I want
to help her, right?

22:04.570 --> 22:06.700
I'm not tracking her down
to punish her, you know.

22:06.740 --> 22:08.700
I'm trying to protect her.

22:08.740 --> 22:14.040
Right. You're
selflessly trying
to come to her rescue.

22:14.080 --> 22:15.450
You need Bridget.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.000
Hey, I'm not
denying that.

22:17.040 --> 22:18.710
She's the only witness
to a murder

22:18.750 --> 22:20.830
that Bodaway Macawi committed.

22:20.880 --> 22:23.250
I know how
valuable she is.

22:23.300 --> 22:25.630
I also know that she
trusted you with her life.

22:25.670 --> 22:27.720
She's gonna reach out
to you at some point.

22:27.760 --> 22:31.050
And when you do
hear from her...

22:31.090 --> 22:32.260
I just hope
you do the right thing.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.150
Hold him overnight,
and then kick him loose.

22:47.190 --> 22:48.530
Kick him loose?
We got enough

22:48.570 --> 22:50.410
to charge him
for possession.

22:50.450 --> 22:52.740
I'm not interested
in a drug bust.

22:52.780 --> 22:56.040
Malcolm Ward's gonna take us
to Bridget Kelly.

22:56.080 --> 22:58.870
NEWSCASTER: Switching gears,
let's check the financial news.

22:58.910 --> 23:00.500
REPORTER: Looks like
a little bit of an upswing...

23:00.540 --> 23:02.330
JULIET:
Daddy's working late?

23:02.380 --> 23:03.380
Yeah.

23:10.760 --> 23:12.510
How's school?

23:12.550 --> 23:13.600
It's school.

23:16.060 --> 23:18.270
That girl still
bothering you?

23:18.310 --> 23:21.230
Yeah...but my teacher's
taking care of it.

23:21.270 --> 23:22.350
He gets it.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.360
(newscast continues quietly)

23:28.860 --> 23:31.150
You know, it sucks
about what happened.

23:31.200 --> 23:33.700
With the baby.

23:33.740 --> 23:35.910
I feel awful.

23:35.950 --> 23:38.950
Why? It's not your fault.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.580
(laughs):
I'm not gonna lie.

23:41.620 --> 23:45.290
I was anti-baby in
the beginning, but...

23:45.340 --> 23:49.170
then I started to think
it'd be...cool

23:49.210 --> 23:52.630
to have a little
brother or sister.

23:52.680 --> 23:54.470
You think you and Daddy are
gonna try again or...?

23:58.640 --> 24:01.350
I don't think so.

24:01.390 --> 24:02.810
I really just...

24:02.850 --> 24:04.520
I want things to go back
to the way they were.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.900
Maybe we could get
a dog instead.

24:09.940 --> 24:11.900
(both laugh)

24:16.320 --> 24:17.370
(door closes)

24:20.830 --> 24:22.250
Hey. Morning.

24:22.290 --> 24:23.790
Morning.

24:23.830 --> 24:25.830
I was thinking that maybe
we could have lunch today...

24:25.880 --> 24:29.800
Do you mind?
I'm reading.

24:29.840 --> 24:31.380
What's wrong?

24:31.420 --> 24:32.510
Just doing
what you want,

24:32.550 --> 24:35.760
going back to the
way things were.

24:35.800 --> 24:37.390
When did I say that?

24:37.430 --> 24:39.430
To Juliet.

24:39.470 --> 24:40.810
Last night.

24:40.850 --> 24:42.980
I heard you two talking.

24:43.020 --> 24:44.940
We really need to get
some doors in this place.

24:47.610 --> 24:51.110
I just meant I want things
to go back to normal.

24:51.150 --> 24:53.740
Before Gemma, before my sister.

24:53.780 --> 24:56.490
Trust me, the last thing that
I want is to be playing games.

24:56.530 --> 24:58.910
Really?

24:58.950 --> 25:01.160
You blew me off
yesterday morning.

25:01.200 --> 25:04.870
I didn't mean to blow you--
<b></b>
You tell Juliet you
don't want to try again.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.830
Because I thought
it was too soon.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.170
Siobhan...

25:08.210 --> 25:11.250
we talked about it.

25:11.300 --> 25:13.800
This baby changed things.

25:13.840 --> 25:15.970
And without it, I just
don't know where we stand.

25:16.010 --> 25:19.350
(phone ringing)

25:19.390 --> 25:21.520
Take it, I've got to
go to work anyway.

25:21.560 --> 25:22.720
Could we talk later?

25:22.770 --> 25:24.390
I've got a business
dinner later.

25:24.430 --> 25:26.350
I would invite you,
but I know how much
you hate those.

25:26.390 --> 25:28.940
I don't. I just want us
to spend time together.

25:28.980 --> 25:31.610
Well, you've got a very
funny way of showing it.

25:31.650 --> 25:32.980
(ringing continues)

25:33.030 --> 25:33.900
Take your call.

25:37.820 --> 25:38.780
(sighs)

25:39.820 --> 25:41.410
Where have you been?

25:41.450 --> 25:43.790
I've left you, like,
a million messages.

25:43.830 --> 25:46.540
I need to see you.

25:46.580 --> 25:48.830
There's a coffee shop on 83rd
across from the park.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.420
Meet me in 10.

25:50.460 --> 25:51.500
I'll be there.

25:53.260 --> 25:54.840
(phone rings)

25:54.880 --> 25:56.800
(groans softly)

25:56.840 --> 25:57.930
Yeah?

25:57.970 --> 26:00.260
Mrs. Martin, this is
Agent Machado.

26:00.300 --> 26:01.930
I'm surprised to be
hearing from you.

26:01.970 --> 26:03.100
I thought you were leaving town.

26:03.140 --> 26:04.930
Yeah. Change of plans.

26:04.980 --> 26:07.020
Did you know Malcolm Ward's
in New York?

26:07.060 --> 26:08.730
Yeah.

26:08.770 --> 26:10.810
Have you spoken to him?

26:10.860 --> 26:13.820
Actually, I'm on my way
to meet him right now.

26:13.860 --> 26:16.650
You think he knows
where your sister is?

26:16.700 --> 26:18.990
I don't know,
but if I find anything out,

26:19.030 --> 26:20.620
I'll be sure to call you.

26:20.660 --> 26:22.660
I appreciate it, Mrs. Martin.

26:22.700 --> 26:26.870
(sighs)
I have
a better idea.

26:26.910 --> 26:29.250
You can wear a wire,
and then I can watch you

26:29.290 --> 26:32.290
from a surveillance van
across the street.

26:32.340 --> 26:34.960
I don't know if I'm
comfortable with that.
<b></b>
Oh, no, no, no, no.

26:35.010 --> 26:37.090
Come on, Mrs. Martin, you've
been so cooperative lately.

26:37.130 --> 26:39.090
Don't make me do
this the hard way.

26:39.130 --> 26:41.260
What, you're gonna throw me
in jail if I won't do it?

26:41.300 --> 26:44.100
No. No, but I know
some things about you

26:44.140 --> 26:46.020
and Henry Butler that
you want to keep quiet,

26:46.060 --> 26:48.730
and I'd just hate
to start talking if
I didn't have to.

27:04.030 --> 27:05.330
You must be Malcolm.

27:05.370 --> 27:07.200
Sorry I'm late.

27:07.250 --> 27:08.200
Siobhan.

27:11.040 --> 27:12.000
Siobhan.

27:14.880 --> 27:18.210
I, uh, wish we were meeting
under better circumstances.

27:18.260 --> 27:21.340
Excuse me?

27:21.380 --> 27:24.140
Are you OK?

27:24.180 --> 27:25.430
I'm fine.

27:25.470 --> 27:27.600
Are you?

27:27.640 --> 27:29.140
I'm holding up all right,

27:29.180 --> 27:30.480
considering the circumstances.

27:33.730 --> 27:36.320
Oh! Aah! Goodness. Um...

27:36.360 --> 27:37.440
Oh, that might stain.

27:37.480 --> 27:38.610
Will you excuse me
for one second?

27:41.530 --> 27:43.280
Oh, come on.
You gotta be kidding me.

27:51.410 --> 27:52.370
Sorry about that.

27:52.420 --> 27:54.040
(laughs)

27:54.080 --> 27:56.630
It's a sign I've already had
too much coffee today.

27:56.670 --> 27:59.130
So, have you heard from Bridget?

27:59.170 --> 28:00.760
WAITER:
Sir?

28:00.800 --> 28:01.880
Can I interest you
in something to eat?

28:07.010 --> 28:09.020
Just leave the damn menu
and get out of there.

28:13.440 --> 28:15.360
I'm good. Thanks.

28:15.400 --> 28:16.360
I'm fine.

28:19.320 --> 28:22.070
No, I haven't
heard from her.

28:22.110 --> 28:24.200
That's why I came
to New York.

28:24.240 --> 28:26.830
To try to find her.

28:26.870 --> 28:29.040
You know, if you do,
you can tell me.

28:29.080 --> 28:30.750
You can trust me.

28:30.790 --> 28:32.710
MALCOLM:
It's not about trust.

28:32.750 --> 28:34.040
I'm in the dark.

28:34.080 --> 28:35.920
I was hoping
you could fill me in.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.130
This isn't going anywhere.

28:42.840 --> 28:43.800
What the hell
was that?

28:43.840 --> 28:45.140
You didn't tell me

28:45.180 --> 28:47.010
that Bridget's friend
was a drug addict.

28:47.050 --> 28:48.180
We had your back.

28:48.220 --> 28:49.640
I just needed to know
what he knows.

28:49.680 --> 28:52.230
(laughs)
My back? What about his?

28:52.270 --> 28:53.230
You should have gotten him help.

28:53.270 --> 28:54.560
You helped Bridget.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.100
Bridget was a witness
in my custody.

28:56.150 --> 28:58.110
Malcolm Ward's not
my responsibility.

28:58.150 --> 29:00.110
Oh. I get it.

29:00.150 --> 29:02.360
Only help people if you have
a vested interest in them.

29:07.410 --> 29:08.530
Malcolm?!

29:11.490 --> 29:12.870
You lied to me.

29:12.910 --> 29:15.000
It was the one thing you
said you would never do.

29:15.040 --> 29:17.710
I'm sorry. Am I talking
to Bridget or Siobhan?

29:17.750 --> 29:19.040
I didn't have a choice.

29:19.090 --> 29:20.800
I told you, Machado
made me wear that wire.

29:20.840 --> 29:22.090
So you're Bridget now?

29:22.130 --> 29:23.670
Because I can't tell
anymore. Can you?

29:23.720 --> 29:25.260
You think I like pretending
to be somebody else?

29:25.300 --> 29:26.630
I hate it.

29:26.680 --> 29:28.510
Well, I think
you're starting to like it.

29:28.550 --> 29:31.560
The clothes,
the money, the guy.

29:31.600 --> 29:32.930
You're calling me a liar,

29:32.970 --> 29:34.480
but you're the one
that's full of it.

29:34.520 --> 29:35.730
You know what?
This isn't about
me right now.

29:35.770 --> 29:36.940
This is about you.

29:38.690 --> 29:39.860
You're using.

29:39.900 --> 29:42.110
No, I'm not.
<b></b>
How could you do this?

29:42.150 --> 29:43.530
I didn't do anything.

29:45.650 --> 29:48.280
Bodaway did.

29:48.320 --> 29:52.240
He got me hooked,
just to take it away.

29:52.290 --> 29:55.870
He thought the withdrawal
would make me give you up.

29:55.910 --> 29:57.460
Malcolm, why didn't you
tell me?

29:57.500 --> 30:00.040
(laughing):
Like that's so easy.

30:00.080 --> 30:02.340
I'd been sober for 5 years.

30:02.380 --> 30:04.260
And that piece of crap took
everything I worked for

30:04.300 --> 30:06.420
away in a few weeks.

30:06.470 --> 30:09.260
I barely got
out alive,

30:09.300 --> 30:12.560
and when I did...I wanted more.

30:13.930 --> 30:16.680
But I can beat this.

30:16.730 --> 30:19.650
I beat it once,
I can do it again.

30:19.690 --> 30:22.610
Let me help you, please.

30:22.650 --> 30:24.190
I could use some more money.

30:24.230 --> 30:27.570
No, I will not
help you buy drugs.

30:27.610 --> 30:30.280
I need to wean myself.

30:30.320 --> 30:31.410
I can handle it.

30:31.450 --> 30:33.490
No, you can't.

30:33.540 --> 30:37.120
Come on, step number one--
admitting you're powerless.

30:37.160 --> 30:38.540
I don't need you
to remind me of the steps.

30:38.580 --> 30:40.080
Well, apparently you do

30:40.120 --> 30:43.500
because you think you can
beat this while still using.

30:43.550 --> 30:45.420
Malcolm, come on.

30:45.460 --> 30:47.970
This time let me be the one
that's straight with you.

30:48.010 --> 30:49.680
(laughs)
How can you be the one

30:49.720 --> 30:51.890
that's straight with me
when you can't even be honest

30:51.930 --> 30:52.930
about who you are?

31:06.940 --> 31:08.190
What the hell, Mr. C.?

31:08.240 --> 31:10.240
Why did you transfer me
out of your class?

31:10.280 --> 31:12.030
You and Tessa were becoming
a bit of a disruption.

31:12.070 --> 31:13.280
But I thought you were going
to transfer her.

31:13.320 --> 31:14.450
I don't,
I don't get it.

31:16.290 --> 31:19.410
I...I thought
you liked me.

31:19.460 --> 31:20.460
I do like you.

31:22.460 --> 31:24.840
Just not that way.

31:24.880 --> 31:28.010
You're a good kid, Juliet,
but this is for the best.

31:29.840 --> 31:31.260

34:16.300 --> 34:18.260
(phone ringing)

34:24.270 --> 34:25.890
Tyler?

34:25.930 --> 34:28.640
TYLER: I'm surprised
you even answered, Siobhan.

34:28.690 --> 34:30.150
Excuse me?

34:30.190 --> 34:32.730
No wonder you didn't want
to go to Rome with me.

34:32.770 --> 34:35.570
Too busy flying to New York
to see your husband.

34:35.610 --> 34:38.200
Wow, you...you are
an amazing actress.

34:38.240 --> 34:40.110
3 full courses
of pretending like we never met.

34:43.200 --> 34:45.200
Tyler, I'm coming back
to Paris tomorrow, we can...

34:45.240 --> 34:46.910
Don't bother.

34:46.950 --> 34:48.410
Tyler, please...

34:48.460 --> 34:50.790
Oh, and you might want
to find yourself a new hotel.

34:50.830 --> 34:53.380
Martin/Charles is done
bankrolling your stay.

34:53.420 --> 34:54.840
Tyler...

34:54.880 --> 34:55.840
(sighing)

35:03.810 --> 35:05.430
...so, heaven.
Evening.

35:14.480 --> 35:15.780
I think I need some help.

35:20.820 --> 35:24.080
Andrew...

35:24.120 --> 35:26.620
this is Malcolm Ward.

35:32.750 --> 35:34.790
Why didn't you tell me
the other night at the hospital

35:34.840 --> 35:37.710
that you were a friend
of Siobhan's sister?

35:37.760 --> 35:39.510
Your wife needed help.

35:39.550 --> 35:42.010
Just didn't
seem important

35:42.050 --> 35:43.390
Here.
Thank you.

35:52.480 --> 35:55.190
I was kind of hoping
that we could give him

35:55.230 --> 35:57.820
a place to stay
for the night.

35:57.860 --> 35:59.440
I know he was a
friend of Bridget's,

35:59.490 --> 36:03.820
and that's not exactly
a ringing endorsement,

36:03.870 --> 36:06.450
but he was one of
the only good things

36:06.490 --> 36:08.290
in my sister's life.

36:08.330 --> 36:10.290
MALCOLM:
You can do this.

36:10.330 --> 36:12.460
I know making amends
is a scary step,

36:12.500 --> 36:14.500
but after everything
you've been through,

36:14.540 --> 36:17.210
this will be a
piece of cake.

36:17.250 --> 36:18.210
I'm just here for backup.

36:19.760 --> 36:24.300
(line ringing)

36:24.340 --> 36:28.850
Hey, Siobhan, it's Bridge.

36:28.890 --> 36:31.600
Shiv, the man
helped you out.

36:31.640 --> 36:32.770
That's all the convincing
I need.

36:52.250 --> 36:54.040
right here, you know,
just in case.

36:56.380 --> 36:58.750
I know this is awkward,

36:58.790 --> 37:01.420
but thank you.

37:03.720 --> 37:06.680
I'm just here

37:06.720 --> 37:08.720
You all squared away?

37:08.760 --> 37:11.850
I'm set, thanks.

37:11.890 --> 37:13.980
Are you coming, Shiv?

37:14.020 --> 37:15.730
It's OK.

37:15.770 --> 37:18.400
Go to bed.

37:18.440 --> 37:20.730
You know, just
give me a second.

37:20.780 --> 37:21.730
Of course.

37:27.240 --> 37:29.370
Are you sure?

37:29.410 --> 37:31.490
I don't want to mess
anything up for you.

37:31.540 --> 37:32.580
You won't.

37:36.460 --> 37:38.540
Malcolm, I need you to know

37:38.580 --> 37:41.550

Yeah, I mean, sign

you never use it,

38:03.070 --> 38:05.530

38:15.710 --> 38:17.330
Of course, yeah.

38:17.370 --> 38:18.370
Come in.

38:22.500 --> 38:23.670
You're going to get
through this.

38:34.390 --> 38:36.680
Siobhan.

38:36.730 --> 38:38.600
This is my friend Malcolm.

38:38.640 --> 38:42.980
He needs my help,
and I need yours.

38:43.020 --> 38:45.530
