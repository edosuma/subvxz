00:25.270 --> 00:28.290
This isn’t the time to be playing chess.

00:30.730 --> 00:33.840
Nothing good comes of overexerting yourself.

00:33.840 --> 00:35.930
Why not leave it to Sebastian?

00:36.460 --> 00:38.700
He’s nothing more than one of my pawns.

00:38.700 --> 00:40.890
It’s me who gives the orders and moves him.

00:41.700 --> 00:43.850
However, he is not a normal pawn.

00:44.170 --> 00:47.170
He is a pawn that can get across the whole board in one move.

00:47.730 --> 00:48.520
Like this.

00:49.900 --> 00:52.060
Isn’t that against the rules?

00:52.060 --> 00:55.220
Yes, if it was a game we were talking about.

00:55.220 --> 00:58.490
However, rules hold no meaning in the real world.

00:59.240 --> 01:03.890
There will inevitably be knights who break the rules, and pawns who disobey orders.

01:03.890 --> 01:09.160
If you let your guard down for even an instant, you’ll be in checkmate.

03:04.890 --> 03:09.850
<font size="50">His Butler,</font>

03:05.510 --> 03:09.850
<font size="50"><font color="#2f281c">Fated</font></font>

03:06.140 --> 03:09.850
<font size="50"><font color="#2f281c">Meeting</font></font>

03:11.190 --> 03:13.830
There should be many ways for you to live

03:14.210 --> 03:16.600
that don’t involve being the underworld’s guard dog.

03:16.600 --> 03:20.800
My sister, your mother, would have wanted that for you as well.

03:21.230 --> 03:25.010
Even so, the reason you have returned to this underworld

03:25.870 --> 03:29.480
is that you want revenge for the death of your parents, isn’t it?

03:32.260 --> 03:36.270
Even if you exact revenge, it will not bring back those who have died,

03:36.270 --> 03:38.250
nor will it will bring happiness to them.

03:38.250 --> 03:39.740
But…

03:39.740 --> 03:45.080
I did not return to the ways of the Phantomhives because of the previous generation.

03:47.720 --> 03:49.080
I did it for myself,

03:51.040 --> 03:54.520
in order to bestow the same pain and humiliation I felt

03:54.520 --> 03:59.250
upon those who betrayed us and sullied the Phantomhive name.

04:00.200 --> 04:04.220
I still remember the day you were born.

04:04.610 --> 04:10.180
You were so small and fragile, and you brought out my protective instinct.

04:11.400 --> 04:18.300
I was unable to have children, but I really do think of you as my own son.

04:18.950 --> 04:21.470
If possible, I’d like you to take your leave of…

04:21.470 --> 04:26.910
The reason I’m doing this right now is down to my own wishes and choices.

04:27.530 --> 04:30.370
I do not regret it, nor do I wish to be indulged out of pity.

04:31.110 --> 04:32.210
Not by anyone.

04:35.360 --> 04:37.560
I’ll be fine from here, Sebastian.

04:37.560 --> 04:38.720
But…

04:40.490 --> 04:43.260
Please do not stray from that child’s side,

04:43.840 --> 04:48.140
so he does not wander off his path and get lost.

04:49.660 --> 04:55.350
I shall, without fail. I intend to stay and protect him until the end.

04:57.440 --> 05:00.860
I have come to pick you up, Mistress.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.030
How is it?

05:11.090 --> 05:13.870
No matter how many times I re-examine it, the answer is the same.

05:14.540 --> 05:17.540
The viscount wasn’t involved in yesterday’s case.

05:17.540 --> 05:18.630
That is correct.

05:19.290 --> 05:22.170
It would have been impossible for him or anyone in his household.

05:22.170 --> 05:25.770
That’s right, the people in there are…

05:26.380 --> 05:28.260
At any rate, tomorrow we shall…

05:29.980 --> 05:32.470
Sebastian… Impossible!

05:33.030 --> 05:37.770
I’ve told you many times, have I not? I will not lie to you.

05:38.400 --> 05:43.530
Of those with proficiency in the medical arts, connections to black magic or cults,

05:43.530 --> 05:46.740
and who lack an alibi at the time of the incidents,

05:47.490 --> 05:51.920
Viscount Druitt is the only one who fits the profile.

05:51.920 --> 05:54.700
Does that mean the investigation was just a farce, then?

05:54.700 --> 06:01.920
I am one hell of a butler, so I am faithful only to that which my master has ordered and asked of me.

06:04.910 --> 06:09.430
Under one of your orders, I am to be your pawn and your sword.

06:10.820 --> 06:14.560
So, please, Young Master, move me into check.

06:21.860 --> 06:24.670
He’ll come if we hang out here, won’t he?

06:24.670 --> 06:25.150
Yes.

06:25.690 --> 06:28.840
It’s true that, among the prostitutes who were killed,

06:28.840 --> 06:31.530
there were other similarities apart from their organs having been removed.

06:32.160 --> 06:34.370
Beautiful, shimmering black hair.

06:34.370 --> 06:37.330
But why did he need to kill them?

06:37.870 --> 06:40.670
That allure which could even be called sinful.

06:40.670 --> 06:42.010
And also, I—

06:42.010 --> 06:43.180
That wonderful softness.

06:43.180 --> 06:45.380
Ah, that wonderful softness.

06:45.380 --> 06:47.580
Listen when someone is talking to you!

06:48.060 --> 06:50.960
I apologise. I was simply so taken with its rare beauty that…

06:50.960 --> 06:51.640
Soft.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.130
There shouldn’t be any way for someone to go through.

06:57.130 --> 06:57.810
Let us go.

07:12.060 --> 07:12.570
You cannot…

07:27.460 --> 07:29.880
You’ve splattered it around in a rather lavish way, have you not,

07:30.920 --> 07:32.580
Jack the Ripper?

07:34.090 --> 07:34.970
No,

07:34.970 --> 07:36.780
Greil Sutcliffe.

07:37.830 --> 07:40.180
N—No, this isn’t…

07:40.860 --> 07:43.600
I rushed here after hearing the scream and it was already too…

07:44.250 --> 07:48.360
Do you really think you can feign innocence when you look like that, Greil?

07:48.970 --> 07:52.820
This is the first time I have met someone like you in the human world.

07:53.650 --> 07:56.360
You show the façade of a helpless butler to everyone.

07:57.390 --> 08:00.500
You really fooled everyone quite splendidly.

08:02.590 --> 08:04.880
Splendidly…

08:07.340 --> 08:09.160
Really?

08:10.420 --> 08:11.880
That’s right.

08:11.880 --> 08:14.810
I am an actress.

08:14.810 --> 08:17.340
Quite an exceptional one at that.

08:19.050 --> 08:23.310
But you aren’t just a normal Sebastian either, are you?

08:23.890 --> 08:28.770
It’s the name I was given by the young master, so I am Sebastian. For now.

08:28.770 --> 08:31.710
My, that’s quite the subservient personality you have.

08:31.710 --> 08:34.750
However, I suppose that’s also splendid in a handsome man like yourself.

08:34.750 --> 08:40.520
Well then, once again, Sebastian… No, Sebby.

08:40.520 --> 08:44.610
I will introduce myself anew. I am the Barnett family butler Greil Sutcliffe.

08:44.610 --> 08:47.210
As a fellow butler, please treat me kindly.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.470
My, I finally get to meet you without a disguise.

08:52.470 --> 08:56.510
I was quite surprised to begin with as it was the first time I had seen a demon act as a butler.

08:57.020 --> 08:59.440
Surely that is my line.

08:59.440 --> 09:02.140
For someone like you to be acting as a butler…

09:02.650 --> 09:06.100
You are supposed to be a neutral being in the balance between gods and humans;

09:07.600 --> 09:09.440
a Reaper.

09:10.050 --> 09:13.070
Why would you, briefly like unto God, become a butler?

09:13.520 --> 09:15.090
Indeed…

09:15.090 --> 09:17.870
Shall we say for now that I fell in love with a woman?

09:19.650 --> 09:21.410
And that woman is?

09:21.410 --> 09:24.250
You know that without even asking, don’t you?

09:34.110 --> 09:35.230
Madam.

09:36.190 --> 09:38.270
This was beyond my expectations.

09:38.270 --> 09:41.350
To think that there would be someone able to see Greil’s true nature…

09:42.180 --> 09:45.520
You were on the preliminary suspect list, of course, Madam.

09:45.910 --> 09:48.860
However, your alibi was perfect.

09:48.860 --> 09:51.360
You even suspected me, one of your relatives?

09:51.730 --> 09:56.070
If the individual was capable of becoming “Jack”, blood relations had no bearing.

09:56.480 --> 10:01.640
It was impossible for any human on that list to be involved in all the incidents.

10:01.640 --> 10:05.790
However, if the accomplice were inhuman, then that would change everything.

10:06.490 --> 10:10.420
If they were able to get into a room within a split second without us noticing,

10:10.980 --> 10:15.170
and move from the viscount’s home to the East End in an instant,

10:16.060 --> 10:19.130
then “Jack the Ripper” could be none other

10:19.830 --> 10:23.310
than Madam Red and Greil Sutcliffe!

10:24.070 --> 10:28.550
Among the victims of Jack the Ripper, there were other connecting factors.

10:28.550 --> 10:34.170
They all underwent specific surgery at the Central London hospital where you work.

10:34.170 --> 10:36.350
Among the list of patients we compiled,

10:36.350 --> 10:40.780
the only one who had not been killed was the one living in that room, Mary Kelly.

10:41.650 --> 10:44.950
We knew that, if we loitered around here, you’d be sure to show up.

10:47.490 --> 10:49.920
Though we could not save her…

10:50.320 --> 10:51.980
This is so unfortunate, Ciel,

10:51.980 --> 10:54.000
my adorable nephew.

10:54.700 --> 10:58.010
If you hadn’t noticed, we would have been able to play chess again.

10:58.880 --> 11:03.220
However, this time, I will not give anything up!

11:12.190 --> 11:13.450
What is that?

11:15.020 --> 11:18.430
Reapers have a tool they use to prey on people’s souls.

11:18.430 --> 11:20.610
It is the Reaper’s scythe.

11:20.610 --> 11:23.250
Don’t give it a lame name like “scythe”!

11:23.250 --> 11:25.280
I took such trouble to customise it!

11:26.100 --> 11:28.640
It’s able to shred any substance that stands in its way.

11:28.640 --> 11:31.790
Only I am permitted this death-scythe.

11:32.650 --> 11:36.050
I was playing nice for so long that my skills have grown rusty.

11:36.050 --> 11:38.600
It’s been a while, so I want a good workout

11:38.600 --> 11:41.010
wi-th yo-u!

11:41.600 --> 11:44.420
Can you refrain from making such repulsive comments?

11:44.420 --> 11:45.680
I am in the middle of my work.

11:45.680 --> 11:47.650
Ah! How stoic!

11:47.650 --> 11:50.100
That part of you pushes me over the edge, too!

11:50.730 --> 11:53.440
You know, I love the colour red.

11:54.130 --> 11:56.020
Hair, clothes, even lipstick.

11:56.020 --> 11:57.690
Red is my favourite colour.

11:58.460 --> 12:01.150
That’s why I gave those ugly whores a makeover

12:01.150 --> 12:03.910
with their beautiful red blood.

12:04.310 --> 12:08.250
Sebastian, I’ll make you into an even more appealing man.

12:08.250 --> 12:11.960
I will carve you down to your inner depths,

12:12.850 --> 12:15.250
scattering that beautiful rose-colour everywhere.

12:15.740 --> 12:20.090
Reapers are those who should peacefully hunt down souls heading for death.

12:20.700 --> 12:24.640
Butlers are those who should obey their masters like loyal shadows.

12:25.350 --> 12:28.430
Your poor taste, which violates both of those ideals,

12:28.430 --> 12:31.560
quite simply sickens me.

12:31.980 --> 12:34.420
Oh my, Sebby.

12:34.420 --> 12:37.960
Even so, I am a butler to die for.

12:41.830 --> 12:44.990
On behalf of Her Majesty, and by my own sullied name, I order you:

12:47.220 --> 12:48.990
Dispose of them!

12:49.640 --> 12:52.120
Yes, my Lord!

13:05.760 --> 13:07.840
Ah! Splendid!

13:07.840 --> 13:09.220
Flee more!

13:09.220 --> 13:11.340
This is terrific, Sebby!

13:26.240 --> 13:29.950
See? If you don’t run fast, you’ll be shredded.

13:31.330 --> 13:34.830
Hurting you little by little will be most effective, won’t it?

13:34.830 --> 13:39.130
You and I have become the guard dog and the prey.

13:39.630 --> 13:41.440
If you’re going to hunt me down,

13:43.270 --> 13:44.380
there’s only one way!

13:48.820 --> 13:51.200
Why would you, a doctor…

13:51.200 --> 13:55.140
Even if I explained, a brat like you would never understand!

13:58.870 --> 14:00.430
A brat like you…

14:01.940 --> 14:03.980
Like you…

14:06.360 --> 14:08.990
You should never have been born!

14:13.890 --> 14:14.820
Sister!

14:15.790 --> 14:16.660
Young Master!

14:19.330 --> 14:22.500
Stop, Sebastian. Don’t kill her!

14:32.870 --> 14:34.390
Sebastian…

14:35.830 --> 14:39.600
My, Sebby, you’re so daring!

14:40.380 --> 14:44.230
Even at the cost of an arm, you went to save that kid.

14:44.230 --> 14:47.700
Look at yourself in comparison, Madam.

14:48.350 --> 14:51.160
Hurry up and get rid of that kid!

15:00.560 --> 15:02.480
My beloved sister…

15:03.200 --> 15:05.420
My beloved…

15:06.420 --> 15:08.580
Their beloved little…

15:11.490 --> 15:12.530
I can’t.

15:13.790 --> 15:15.740
I just can’t.

15:15.740 --> 15:18.020
I can’t kill this child.

15:18.410 --> 15:22.480
What are you saying after having cut up all those women?

15:22.480 --> 15:25.690
If you don’t get rid of that kid, you’ll be the one who’s disposed of.

15:25.690 --> 15:27.180
Madam.

15:29.070 --> 15:32.280
But this child is my…

15:36.600 --> 15:38.790
I am so disappointed, Madam Red!

15:39.710 --> 15:43.130
I have no interest in you if you’re just like all the other women!

15:50.890 --> 15:51.970
This is…

15:51.970 --> 15:53.890
The memories played back to be judged

15:53.890 --> 15:57.930
on the list of those who are scheduled to die by a higher power.

15:57.930 --> 16:01.120
That is the job of us Reapers.

16:01.120 --> 16:04.400
What kind of human they are, what sort of life they led,

16:04.400 --> 16:07.040
whether they should be allowed to live or be killed…

16:07.650 --> 16:09.860
In other words, a flashback of their life?

16:09.860 --> 16:13.320
My, do stop it with all those horrible, old-fashioned names.

16:14.290 --> 16:16.220
The dramatic pain.

16:16.220 --> 16:18.640
This is the true power of the Reaper.

16:18.640 --> 16:21.010
Cinematic record.

16:22.850 --> 16:25.570
Rachel, Angelina,

16:25.570 --> 16:28.340
please welcome the Earl of Phantomhive.

16:30.730 --> 16:34.170
I always hated the red hair I’d inherited from my father.

16:34.170 --> 16:37.050
Your red hair is truly beautiful, Anne.

16:37.720 --> 16:39.810
It’s like the colour of liquorice that burns a landscape.

16:40.310 --> 16:42.940
Red suits you very well.

16:42.940 --> 16:45.970
I came to love the red hair I’d inherited from my father.

16:45.970 --> 16:48.230
I came to love red…

16:49.020 --> 16:50.840
I came to love you.

16:50.840 --> 16:53.820
Anne, I have something wonderful to tell you!

16:55.810 --> 16:57.370
You…

16:58.840 --> 17:01.370
I came to hate the colour red once more.

17:02.300 --> 17:06.750
However, I could never hate you.

17:08.990 --> 17:12.670
I married a man I became acquainted with at a banquet.

17:12.670 --> 17:15.339
Will it be a boy, or will it be a girl?

17:16.270 --> 17:19.680
Men are so impatient! I don’t know yet.

17:20.920 --> 17:24.710
It was different from what I had actually wanted, but…

17:24.710 --> 17:27.540
Even so, this time…

17:29.940 --> 17:32.340
A carriage went out of control and hit someone!

17:32.340 --> 17:33.500
Someone call a doctor!

17:34.020 --> 17:36.700
Somehow, it drifted away.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.140
Your husband passed away immediately

17:40.140 --> 17:42.910
and, in order to save your life,

17:43.290 --> 17:47.650
we were forced to remove your womb and abort your child.

17:47.650 --> 17:49.110
Your internal bleeding has…

17:49.110 --> 17:50.770
Everything

17:50.770 --> 17:53.410
drifted further away from me.

17:54.880 --> 17:57.260
That which I had loved,

17:57.730 --> 18:01.140
that which I was coming to love

18:04.280 --> 18:05.600
was dyed.

18:06.910 --> 18:09.100
It was all dyed

18:09.100 --> 18:13.640
in the red colour I so despised.

18:16.750 --> 18:19.680
My sister was able to pass on with her beloved.

18:21.260 --> 18:27.790
If only my feelings had also been buried beneath the ground back then.

18:30.130 --> 18:33.140
Children are just a nuisance.

18:33.140 --> 18:37.900
You never know whose child it might be, and you have to keep things child-safe and can’t entertain men.

18:37.900 --> 18:41.180
I, who lost everything…

18:41.700 --> 18:47.890
Though they have what will never again come into my life…

18:48.640 --> 18:51.410
Women who throw that away without a second thought…

18:52.770 --> 18:55.600
I will dye them.

18:57.170 --> 18:59.400
Oh, you’re the one from the other day.

19:00.280 --> 19:01.520
What are you doing?

19:02.330 --> 19:02.970
Stop!

19:04.910 --> 19:09.120
I will turn everything red with these hands.

19:12.500 --> 19:15.880
My, you put on quite a show.

19:19.680 --> 19:22.720
A bright red Reaper laughingly called out to me.

19:24.860 --> 19:26.610
After a few months,

19:26.610 --> 19:29.980
my nephew, who had gone missing abruptly, came back.

19:30.380 --> 19:31.350
Ciel!

19:32.510 --> 19:35.820
He brought along a butler clad in black.

19:37.440 --> 19:38.940
You were all right!

19:39.920 --> 19:42.420
I was able to have one thing back.

19:42.420 --> 19:45.870
I am so glad that even you alone were spared.

19:46.510 --> 19:48.580
Let me take a look at you.

19:49.060 --> 19:54.540
The child of my beloved and my sister.

19:56.370 --> 20:00.300
“That child came back, so why didn’t he?”

20:01.170 --> 20:04.370
“Why did he end up with my sister and not me?”

20:04.780 --> 20:07.400
This time, I won’t let anything be taken away.

20:07.400 --> 20:09.520
I won’t give anything up.

20:09.760 --> 20:12.390
I won’t give anything up!

20:24.510 --> 20:29.870
I loved you covered in the blood of others, Madam Red!

20:33.040 --> 20:36.500
To think you were such a ridiculous woman! I’m so disappointed.

20:37.030 --> 20:39.630
You have no right to wear red.

20:40.310 --> 20:43.260
The cheap show is now over.

20:43.860 --> 20:46.640
Goodbye, Madam.

20:55.900 --> 20:57.650
Sebastian, what are you doing?

20:59.760 --> 21:02.740
I told you to hunt down Jack the Ripper.

21:03.120 --> 21:05.200
It’s not over yet.

21:06.720 --> 21:08.160
Don’t stand around.

21:08.160 --> 21:10.160
Get rid of the other one.

21:12.480 --> 21:13.620
Understood.

21:14.830 --> 21:17.270
I was going to spare you,

21:17.270 --> 21:20.000
but if it’s your wish, I’ll send you there, too.

21:21.130 --> 21:24.380
Both of you will go to Heaven together!

21:25.330 --> 21:26.620
Heaven?

21:29.990 --> 21:31.520
That has no hold over me.

21:37.970 --> 21:40.040
You just aimed for a lady’s face, didn’t you?

21:40.040 --> 21:41.330
You scum of a man!

21:41.700 --> 21:43.050
Indeed.

21:43.050 --> 21:45.400
I am one hell of a butler, after all.

21:46.550 --> 21:49.340
Do you really think a demon can win against someone who is like unto God?

21:49.960 --> 21:51.150
I wonder.

21:52.060 --> 21:56.040
However, if the young master has told me to win, then I shall win.

21:56.400 --> 21:59.670
You’re putting a lot of effort in for that little shrimp, aren’t you?

21:59.670 --> 22:01.000
You’ll get burnt.

22:01.470 --> 22:02.910
Even if you are a demon,

22:02.910 --> 22:06.440
if you get “hunted” by a real death-scythe, you’ll be eliminated, you know?

22:06.440 --> 22:07.760
Aren’t you scared?

22:08.390 --> 22:16.390
At this moment, my body and soul, to the last hair, belong to my master.

22:16.950 --> 22:24.550
As long as the contract continues, obeying his orders is my duty as a butler.

22:42.250 --> 22:45.130
Nothing I say comes out right.

22:45.130 --> 22:47.880
I can't love without a fight.

22:47.880 --> 22:50.640
No one ever knows my name.

22:50.640 --> 22:53.350
When I pray for sun, it rains.

22:53.350 --> 22:56.060
I'm so sick of wasting time,

22:56.060 --> 22:58.770
but nothing's moving in my mind.

22:58.770 --> 23:01.520
Inspiration can't be found.

23:01.520 --> 23:03.730
I get up and fall, but...

23:03.730 --> 23:06.530
I'm alive!

23:06.530 --> 23:08.860
I'm alive!

23:08.860 --> 23:09.780
Oh yeah!

23:09.780 --> 23:13.200
Between the good and bad is where you'll find me,

23:13.200 --> 23:14.700
reaching for Heaven!

23:14.700 --> 23:17.450
I will fight!

23:17.450 --> 23:19.710
And I'll sleep when I die!

23:19.710 --> 23:22.420
I live my life!

23:22.880 --> 23:25.630
I'm alive!

23:25.630 --> 23:27.970
I'm alive!

23:27.970 --> 23:28.970
Oh yeah!

23:28.970 --> 23:32.340
Between the good and bad is where you'll find me,

23:32.340 --> 23:33.890
reaching for Heaven!

23:33.890 --> 23:36.640
I will fight!

23:36.640 --> 23:38.850
And I'll sleep when I die!

23:38.850 --> 23:44.360
I live my hard life!

23:44.360 --> 23:50.860
I live my life! I'm alive!

23:58.030 --> 24:00.690
Liquorice flowers, so red they seem to burn the landscape,

24:00.690 --> 24:02.500
eventually turn brown,

24:02.500 --> 24:04.850
wither and wilt.

24:04.850 --> 24:08.970
Yes, this all obeys nature’s laws, <i>death!</i>

24:09.770 --> 24:11.570
I apologise for that.

24:11.570 --> 24:15.070
I do not wish to allow that terrible taste to prevail anymore.

24:15.070 --> 24:18.220
I will have him take his leave by means of a swift death.

24:18.870 --> 24:22.800
Next time on Kuroshitsuji: His Butler, At the Funeral

24:20.500 --> 24:26.710
<font size="50"><font color="#ffffff">His Butler, At the Funeral</font></font>

24:20.500 --> 24:26.710
<font size="35"><font color="#ffffff">Preview</font></font>

24:22.800 --> 24:25.400
After all, I am one hell of a butler.

24:26.840 --> 24:29.610
<font size="22" face="Californian FB">We shall await you next time...</font>
