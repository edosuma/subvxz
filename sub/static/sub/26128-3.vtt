WEBVTT

00:02.086 --> 00:03.379
Fuck you guys want?

00:03.462 --> 00:05.798
It's the recap shit.

00:05.881 --> 00:08.134
What, you guys miss
last week's episode?

00:08.217 --> 00:09.719
Eh, we should probably
show it to 'em.

00:09.802 --> 00:11.804
I guess.

00:12.847 --> 00:13.848
Go!

00:13.931 --> 00:15.933
You want to volunteer?
Here?

00:16.017 --> 00:18.227
Yes, sir.
In need of some documentation,

00:18.310 --> 00:20.521
community service.
Trying to get into West Point.

00:20.604 --> 00:22.189
Only takes three
or four minutes

00:22.273 --> 00:24.942
if you get the, uh,
hose on the tailpipe right.

00:25.026 --> 00:26.152
You're killing dogs?

00:26.235 --> 00:28.112
All right, well,
you guys just relax.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.905
Just die naturally.

00:29.989 --> 00:31.574
Where are all
the female employees?

00:31.657 --> 00:34.368
- At the woman's march!
- Selling pussy hats.

00:34.452 --> 00:35.703
"Jugs"?

00:35.786 --> 00:36.787
I lied to you this morning.

00:36.871 --> 00:38.622
- There is a woman on my site.
- Who?

00:38.706 --> 00:39.790
Me.

00:40.791 --> 00:42.626
A-are they giving you
your meds in there?

00:42.710 --> 00:44.879
I-I'm protecting
defenseless lambs from having

00:44.962 --> 00:47.506
their emotional and physical
spirits slaughtered.

00:49.091 --> 00:51.385
Gallagher!
You made bail.

00:51.469 --> 00:52.636
Your disciples!

00:52.720 --> 00:55.139
We crowdsourced your bail
to get you out.

00:55.222 --> 00:56.515
Gay Jesus!

01:00.061 --> 01:01.395
- Commercial real estate?
- Yeah,

01:01.479 --> 01:02.563
you're the one
who told me to invest.

01:02.646 --> 01:04.732
Max Whitford's just gonna try
and fuck you, trust me.

01:04.815 --> 01:06.317
You seem savvy.
We're putting in

01:06.400 --> 01:08.319
another Sunset Brooks
senior care center.

01:08.402 --> 01:09.737
You'd need a hundred to play.

01:09.820 --> 01:11.238
Then I got a hundred
in my pocket.

01:13.824 --> 01:15.201
We did it.

01:16.952 --> 01:18.996
- I need a sponsor.
- Me?

01:19.080 --> 01:20.289
Helping another AA member's

01:20.372 --> 01:21.916
a hell of a lot better
for your sobriety

01:21.999 --> 01:23.959
than chasing after a kid
who's not yours.

01:24.043 --> 01:27.880
Uh, I'll sponsor you.
Come on.

01:27.963 --> 01:31.550
We someone who will promote
and protect our values!

01:32.259 --> 01:33.302
What about Mo White?

01:33.385 --> 01:35.596
Let's make Chicago White again!

01:37.014 --> 01:38.057
Mo White?

01:38.724 --> 01:39.725
Yeah. Who are you?

01:39.809 --> 01:41.727

It's more like this.

03:18.824 --> 03:20.284
Ooh.
Hey.

03:20.367 --> 03:21.952
- En garde!
- Ooh!

03:22.036 --> 03:24.079
Ooh!

03:24.163 --> 03:25.789
Shh, shh!

03:30.586 --> 03:32.046
Yeah, we're gonna
get busted.

03:32.129 --> 03:33.172

Uh, this one.

03:35.424 --> 03:37.593
Oh, hell, no.

03:37.676 --> 03:41.347
Yo, yo,
Darryl fucking Feathers, man!

03:41.430 --> 03:43.724
He was the foreman
at my last job.

03:43.807 --> 03:47.102
Oh, shit.
This one gets two dicks.

04:02.993 --> 04:03.994
Hey.

04:05.079 --> 04:06.205
Hey.

04:12.711 --> 04:14.588
Um...

04:15.631 --> 04:17.132
The fuck you doing?

04:17.800 --> 04:19.385
Waiting.

04:19.468 --> 04:21.387
- Waiting for what?
- Shim.

04:21.470 --> 04:24.890
Good morning,
my indigenous South Siders!

04:24.974 --> 04:26.183
Don't mind me.

04:26.267 --> 04:27.893
Just showing our support

04:27.977 --> 04:29.853
for a better tomorrow.

04:29.937 --> 04:30.938
Huh?

04:31.021 --> 04:32.273
Hi.

04:32.898 --> 04:34.024
W-what's a "shim"?

04:34.108 --> 04:36.235
Shim. God.

04:36.318 --> 04:39.280
But God doesn't have a gender,
or maybe it's both genders,

04:39.363 --> 04:41.615
so she, him--Shim.

04:41.699 --> 04:43.617
Mother-father God.

04:45.202 --> 04:46.829
And you're waiting
for Shim to...

04:46.912 --> 04:48.706
Talk to me.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.208
Tell me what to do next.

04:53.002 --> 04:54.837
Does that happen a lot?

04:54.920 --> 04:56.255
Used to all the time in jail,

04:56.338 --> 04:58.799
but since I've been out,
nothing.

04:58.882 --> 05:00.592
That's because
it never happened.

05:00.676 --> 05:02.386
Shim,

05:02.469 --> 05:05.889
a higher power,
the great I Am, Great Spirit--

05:05.973 --> 05:08.517
call it whatever you want--
but it ain't talking to you.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.144
And we
weren't talking to you.

05:10.227 --> 05:12.896
Enlightenment, or whatever
these new-fangled

05:12.980 --> 05:14.815

are selling,

05:14.898 --> 05:17.318

05:17.401 --> 05:19.987
Gay Jesus, Taoism,

05:20.070 --> 05:23.073
Scientology,
Christian Science,

05:23.157 --> 05:26.076
Joel Osteen, Deepak Chopra--

05:26.785 --> 05:29.496
It's like going
to one of those flaky schools

05:29.580 --> 05:32.207
where the students create
their own curriculum,

05:32.291 --> 05:35.252
then don't get graded on it.

05:35.336 --> 05:37.338
Religion isn't a startup, Ian.

05:37.421 --> 05:38.589
You want God to talk to you,

05:38.672 --> 05:41.800
you gotta stick with
the classics: Buddhism,

05:41.884 --> 05:44.219
Judaism, Christianity.

05:44.303 --> 05:46.138
And if you break the rules,

05:46.221 --> 05:48.807
you burn in hell
for all eternity.

05:48.891 --> 05:50.392
And there's your enlightenment.

05:50.476 --> 05:52.561
In the meantime,

05:52.644 --> 05:55.272
I shall be saving

07:52.556 --> 07:54.141
Hm.

07:54.224 --> 07:55.851
"Hm"?
What is "hm"?

07:56.477 --> 07:58.228
Well, just seems
like they could've put

07:58.312 --> 07:59.646
a bit more money
into the architecture,

07:59.730 --> 08:01.273
you know?

08:01.356 --> 08:02.941
Well, they're going for a

08:03.025 --> 08:04.568

08:04.651 --> 08:06.320

I love it.

08:06.403 --> 08:08.447
Yeah, well,
it's definitely practical.

08:08.530 --> 08:10.032
Is the thing
Whitford sucked you into?

08:12.034 --> 08:13.452
Whitford didn't suck me
into anything.

08:13.535 --> 08:15.537
I invested
in a limited partnership.

08:15.621 --> 08:17.122
So Max Whitford

08:17.206 --> 08:18.415
makes all the decisions?

08:18.499 --> 08:19.875
The general partner does, yes.

08:19.958 --> 08:22.586
It's an LLC, which means
my liability is limited,

08:22.669 --> 08:24.671
so I can't get sued
by some junkie roofer.

08:24.755 --> 08:26.465
Ah, so you can only lose
all your investment,

08:26.548 --> 08:29.635
- which was how much again?
- 100,000.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.138
- 100,000?
- Mm-hm.

08:33.222 --> 08:34.765
- Dollars?
- With a 30% return

08:34.848 --> 08:36.141

Yo, I gotta go, all right?

09:47.963 --> 09:49.256
My kid's in the emergency room.

09:49.798 --> 09:51.341
You have a kid?

09:52.968 --> 09:54.094
We need more dicks.

09:54.177 --> 09:55.929
I know!

09:56.013 --> 09:57.931
So I know these women in my
trade school welding class.

09:58.015 --> 10:00.225
- I think they can help.
- Mm, cool.

10:01.018 --> 10:02.311

- Watch.

10:09.651 --> 10:11.820
Oh, my God.
It totally does.

10:11.903 --> 10:13.363
Right?

10:13.447 --> 10:14.823
Yeah, I don't have
many straight friends.

10:14.906 --> 10:16.617
I kind of like this.

10:16.700 --> 10:19.494
Me too.
I like having a gay friend.

10:20.329 --> 10:22.581
How old were you when
you realized you were gay?

10:22.664 --> 10:24.583
Uh, the second
they slapped my ass

10:24.666 --> 10:25.876
and cut the umbilical cord.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.336
Okay.

10:27.419 --> 10:30.172

Hey.

10:49.650 --> 10:50.776
What the hell?

10:51.443 --> 10:53.320
They made a list
of the rapiest bars

10:53.403 --> 10:56.114
in the South Side,
and The Alibi's number one?

10:56.198 --> 10:57.449
I haven't raped anybody
in here.

10:57.532 --> 10:59.409
No one's ever raped
anyone in here!

10:59.493 --> 11:01.828
At least not in the inside.
Out in the alleyway, maybe.

11:01.912 --> 11:03.497
But I knew people thought
The Alibi was shitty,

11:03.580 --> 11:04.956
but now they think
we're rapey?

11:05.040 --> 11:07.918
- Who says we're rapey?
- Some stupid article.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.337
Give it to me.
Who wrote it?

11:10.420 --> 11:12.005
Bethany Pickford-Watson.

11:12.089 --> 11:14.549
Of course she has
two last names.

11:14.633 --> 11:16.677
Does she look familiar
to you?

11:16.760 --> 11:18.220
- Oh, probably some lesbo.
- No. No.

11:18.303 --> 11:20.013
- I'd hit that for sure.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

11:20.097 --> 11:22.057
"They even pay
black prostitutes

11:22.140 --> 11:24.101
with fake boobs to walk around
in short skirts."

11:24.184 --> 11:25.268
I'ma kill that bitch.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.395
This is so unfair.

11:26.478 --> 11:28.021
I mean, look around.

11:28.105 --> 11:30.273
W-w-what's so rapey
about this place, anyway?

11:30.357 --> 11:32.401
<i>♪♪ Do your thing, girl ♪♪</i>

11:32.484 --> 11:33.944

11:49.000 --> 11:50.210
I don't know, V.
Maybe this place

11:50.293 --> 11:51.795
- is a little rapey.
- You think?

11:51.878 --> 11:53.380
Craig has his dick out
right now.

11:53.463 --> 11:55.424
Craig! Damn it, man!

11:55.507 --> 11:56.758
Ball bag was hot.

11:58.510 --> 12:01.221
Just a little pop quiz

12:01.304 --> 12:03.515
to see how
your weekend was.

12:03.598 --> 12:06.601
Just kidding.
It's actually ten questions

12:06.685 --> 12:10.021
to see if you remember
how to diagram a sentence.

12:12.983 --> 12:14.860
Liam.

12:14.943 --> 12:16.278
Since this is your first day,

12:16.361 --> 12:18.363
I don't expect you
to know any of this.

12:18.447 --> 12:19.948
Just do the best you can.

12:20.741 --> 12:22.117
Begin.

12:24.828 --> 12:26.913
Psst.

12:26.997 --> 12:28.832
Psst, hey.

12:48.059 --> 12:50.270
Greetings, fellow men
of leisure!

12:50.353 --> 12:52.564
I brought free shit
for ya,

12:52.647 --> 12:54.900
so wear it with pride.

12:54.983 --> 12:57.611
I got hats.
Here you go.

12:57.694 --> 12:59.321
Hats for everyone.

12:59.404 --> 13:01.615
V, can I get a little, um...

13:01.698 --> 13:03.158
What else have I got?
Oh!

13:03.241 --> 13:04.785
T-shirts.
Check these out.

13:04.868 --> 13:06.244
Pass 'em down there.

13:06.328 --> 13:08.288
These are cool.
One size fits all.

13:08.371 --> 13:11.458
What else do I have?
Bumper stickers.

13:11.541 --> 13:13.627
Here, pass those down,
would you?

13:13.710 --> 13:16.922
And, of course, it wouldn't be
a political campaign

13:17.506 --> 13:18.924
without buttons.

13:20.926 --> 13:22.427
Thank you, V.

13:24.262 --> 13:26.556
"Mo White: Mo Better."

13:26.640 --> 13:28.391
You know that's racist, right?

13:28.475 --> 13:29.976
And, needless to say,

13:31.061 --> 13:33.522
your political contributions
are welcome

13:33.605 --> 13:35.690
and most appreciated.

13:36.191 --> 13:38.318
Are you joking me?

13:38.401 --> 13:40.946
Need I remind you,
gentlemen and lady,

13:41.029 --> 13:42.697
what is at stake here?

13:42.781 --> 13:45.325
No one is protecting us.

13:45.408 --> 13:47.577
Mo White
is our only hope.

13:47.661 --> 13:49.830
You sure this isn't
about the money, Frank?

13:49.913 --> 13:52.582
Of course it's about the money,
Tommy!

13:52.666 --> 13:56.711
Contributions are the lifeblood
of a political campaign.

13:56.795 --> 13:59.714
Do you really think the Ruiz
or Wyman campaign

13:59.798 --> 14:02.133
gives a shit about us?

14:02.217 --> 14:03.635
Hell, no!

14:03.718 --> 14:05.262
They're too busy whining

14:05.345 --> 14:09.516
about equality
and cultural heritage.

14:09.599 --> 14:12.269
They're not even
from the South Side!

14:13.854 --> 14:15.063
And I don't know
that they were

14:15.146 --> 14:16.731
born in this country.

14:16.815 --> 14:18.775
Ruiz?

14:18.859 --> 14:21.027
The hell kind of a name
is that?

14:21.778 --> 14:24.239
I'd like to see
that birth certificate.

14:29.953 --> 14:34.332
Mo White will fight
for the things we care about.

14:38.753 --> 14:41.089
Thank you, man.
Thank you. Gentlemen?

14:41.172 --> 14:43.091
Come on, guys. Let's do this.

14:43.174 --> 14:44.759
I know.
It's a bitter pill.

14:44.843 --> 14:48.221
We gotta do it
for our own good.

14:48.305 --> 14:50.265
Here you go.
There you go.

14:50.348 --> 14:52.767
Don't look at me like that.
Come on. Come on.

14:52.851 --> 14:54.728
- Guys, come on.
- Come on. South Side!

14:54.811 --> 14:55.937
It's important.

14:56.021 --> 14:57.397
Fine.

14:58.273 --> 15:00.650
I'm not even gonna ask.

15:00.734 --> 15:03.820
If you will excuse me...

15:05.864 --> 15:07.490
I got some winnin' to do.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.453
Make sure you vote!

15:13.413 --> 15:15.081
I still can't believe
you invested

15:15.165 --> 15:16.917
$100,000 in a vacant lot.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.044
Yep.
Signing the papers tonight,

15:19.127 --> 15:21.004
and then we're gonna flip it
quick.

15:21.087 --> 15:24.007
Ah, I'm meeting him at 7:00.

15:24.841 --> 15:26.885
Does Whitford even know
about me?

15:26.968 --> 15:28.094
Huh?

15:28.178 --> 15:30.430
Does he know about me,
that we're together?

15:31.097 --> 15:32.849
Yeah, we talked
about you.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.226
Hm.

15:35.310 --> 15:37.312
Who are you selling it to?

15:37.395 --> 15:38.813
Sunset Brook.

15:38.897 --> 15:41.024
They're in negotiations
to buy the land.

15:41.107 --> 15:42.108
Hi!

15:42.192 --> 15:43.693
So the deal isn't done yet?

15:43.777 --> 15:45.278
Why are you shitting
on my parade?

15:45.362 --> 15:46.821
Just because you don't think
it's a good idea

15:46.905 --> 15:48.823
doesn't mean you gotta be
a dick about it.

15:48.907 --> 15:50.867
I'm not trying to be a dick.

15:50.951 --> 15:53.620
I'm just saying
that it might be...

15:54.996 --> 15:56.081
I thought we were
gonna eat together.

15:56.164 --> 15:58.333
We can't sit at the table
like normal human beings?

15:58.416 --> 15:59.834
Yeah, but then
the fries get cold.

15:59.918 --> 16:01.753
- Who likes cold French fries?
- Well you didn't even

16:01.836 --> 16:03.630
order fries.
Those are my fries.

16:03.713 --> 16:05.048
Well, here.
You can't eat them all.

16:05.590 --> 16:07.509
Thank you very much.

16:09.427 --> 16:11.513
Listen, for the record,
I do fully support you.

16:11.596 --> 16:14.724
Phase two is...
is gonna be great.

16:14.808 --> 16:16.059
Well, don't just say it
'cause you think

16:16.142 --> 16:17.477
it's what I want to hear.
Be honest.

16:17.560 --> 16:18.770
I was being honest,
and then you told me

16:18.853 --> 16:20.271
I was shitting all over
your parade.

16:20.355 --> 16:21.898
Can I have
my cheeseburger, please?

16:21.982 --> 16:23.441
Yeah.

16:24.693 --> 16:25.944
Thank you.

16:26.027 --> 16:27.320
I'll be at the table.

16:27.404 --> 16:28.655
Mm-hm.

16:51.970 --> 16:55.181
Look, I've never been
to a Buddhist temple before.

16:56.474 --> 16:58.601
I need Shim to talk to me.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.146
Uh, God.
To talk to me.

17:04.607 --> 17:06.192
Any tips?

17:07.027 --> 17:09.154
Repeat.
?
"I'm here to learn.

17:09.237 --> 17:10.780
I'm here to learn.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.449
"I take refuge

17:12.532 --> 17:13.616
in the Buddha."

17:13.700 --> 17:15.785
I take refuge in the Buddha.

17:15.869 --> 17:18.079
"Until I attain enlightenment."

17:18.163 --> 17:21.041
Until I attain
enlightenment.

17:27.672 --> 17:29.090
Quick question.

17:33.428 --> 17:35.221
Once I attain enlightenment,

17:35.305 --> 17:37.098
then will Shim talk to me?

17:37.182 --> 17:39.017
'Cause they did for a while.

17:39.100 --> 17:42.103
But then, suddenly,
it stopped.

17:42.187 --> 17:45.690
So did Shim
stop talking to me,

17:45.774 --> 17:47.692
or did I stop hearing Shim?

17:56.868 --> 17:57.911
I got this, Ralph.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.205
- You sure?
- Yeah, don't worry about it.

18:00.288 --> 18:01.998
I'll take care of Bootsie.

18:02.082 --> 18:03.875
Okay.
Thanks, Carl.

18:03.958 --> 18:05.376
See you tomorrow.

18:07.170 --> 18:08.505
Don't worry, Bootsie.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.507
No serenity
for you today.

18:26.231 --> 18:29.442
Get your dumb-ass tote bag
out of my space!

18:29.526 --> 18:31.069
It's actually
not a tote bag.

18:31.152 --> 18:32.320
It's a satchel.

18:32.403 --> 18:33.780
And who the hell
starts a new school

18:33.863 --> 18:35.281
with three weeks left
in the school year?

18:35.365 --> 18:37.700
All the private schools
were full.

18:39.661 --> 18:41.996
Fucking satchel boy.

18:47.544 --> 18:50.547
I have two daughters.
What kind of father am I

18:50.630 --> 18:53.258
if I'm also the owner
of the local rapery?

18:53.341 --> 18:54.759
V got to you, didn't she?

18:54.843 --> 18:56.427
The Alibi should be
a sanctuary,

18:56.511 --> 18:58.972
a haven where women
can come, relax,

18:59.055 --> 19:00.682
and only get laid
if they want to.

19:00.765 --> 19:02.100
We could all use a place
where we could

19:02.183 --> 19:03.518
get laid if we wanted to.

19:03.601 --> 19:05.019
In this day and age,
you can't

19:05.103 --> 19:06.354
say shit to a woman

19:06.437 --> 19:09.023
without her crying harassment.
Hell, they'd sue

19:09.107 --> 19:11.025
their own reflections
if they could.

19:11.109 --> 19:12.986
I'm just not gonna talk
to them anymore.

19:13.069 --> 19:14.529
No one talks
to your ass anyway.

19:14.612 --> 19:16.531
Yeah, but if they did,
I wouldn't say anything.

19:16.614 --> 19:18.950
Creepily glaring at them
is not the answer.

19:19.033 --> 19:21.995
Hell, I probably catcalled
nine or ten women yesterday.

19:22.078 --> 19:24.164
- You think women like that?
- I'm in construction.

19:24.247 --> 19:25.832
I can't just change.
Doesn't matter

19:25.915 --> 19:28.626
if time's up or not.
If a chick walks by,

19:28.710 --> 19:30.170
I instinctively grab my balls,

19:30.253 --> 19:32.130
?
and yell Suck on this."
It's just what happens.

19:32.213 --> 19:33.840
All right, let's start there.

19:34.549 --> 19:36.384
You can't call 'em chicks
anymore.

19:36.467 --> 19:37.969
Tail?

19:38.052 --> 19:39.721
- No.
- Wool?

19:39.804 --> 19:41.222
No.

19:41.306 --> 19:42.473
Women?

19:42.557 --> 19:44.058
Mm, I don't think so.

19:44.142 --> 19:45.602
Contains the word "men."

19:47.729 --> 19:49.272
I got it.

19:50.064 --> 19:51.649
Vaginal enterprises.

19:52.942 --> 19:54.611
Okay, I'm out.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.196
Maybe we should just
stick with "women."

19:56.279 --> 19:58.573
Oh.
Some... women...

19:58.656 --> 20:00.366
That's better.

20:00.450 --> 20:02.410
Some women like
to be told they're pretty.

20:02.493 --> 20:03.536
- Mm-hmm.
- Now, how are we supposed

20:03.620 --> 20:05.205
to know the difference
between the ones

20:05.288 --> 20:06.456
that like it
and the ones that don't?

20:06.539 --> 20:08.041
Old women like being hit on.

20:08.124 --> 20:10.210
Maybe we should just allow
the old women in.

20:10.293 --> 20:11.502
- Kermit!
- Why the hell

20:11.586 --> 20:13.004
would we want that?

20:13.087 --> 20:15.048
We need a consistent standard.

20:15.131 --> 20:16.716
All right,
here's your standard.

20:16.799 --> 20:18.259
Assume you are disgusting,

20:18.343 --> 20:19.844
that no one wants you
to touch them,

20:19.928 --> 20:21.221
and they couldn't care less
if you think

20:21.304 --> 20:23.514
they're pretty or not--
there's your damn standard.

20:24.265 --> 20:25.808
I've never been
so confused.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.143
The bottom line

20:27.227 --> 20:29.520
is that the bar
can't be rapey anymore.

20:30.396 --> 20:32.273
If women stay away,

20:32.732 --> 20:34.192
bad for business.

20:34.275 --> 20:36.486
Plus, rapey is wrong.

20:37.820 --> 20:40.031
A-and more importantly,
rapey is wrong.

20:45.328 --> 20:47.288
What's that twirly writing?

20:47.372 --> 20:48.456
Cursive.

20:48.915 --> 20:51.084
- You know cursive.
- Yes, ma'am.

20:51.167 --> 20:52.543
Wow.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.219
Sorry, 'scuse me!

21:01.302 --> 21:02.720
Hi.
Hey, I'm looking

21:02.804 --> 21:04.430
for a Xan,
X-A-N.

21:04.514 --> 21:05.515
Last name?

21:05.598 --> 21:07.141
Um, Galvez.

21:07.225 --> 21:08.768
Xan Galvez.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.562
Is she here?
She okay?

21:11.646 --> 21:12.772
And you are...

21:12.855 --> 21:14.440
Lip.
I'm her, um--her brother.

21:20.863 --> 21:23.032
Sorry, don't have
any record of a Xan.

21:23.116 --> 21:25.159
Oh, she, uh--
she has really crazy hair,

21:25.243 --> 21:26.828
she came in
with a broken arm.

21:26.911 --> 21:28.496
We had a girl come in earlier
with a broken arm.

21:28.579 --> 21:29.914
Yeah?

21:29.998 --> 21:31.624
Let's see...

21:31.708 --> 21:33.876
- Alexandra Galvez?
- Yes, that's her.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.295
Have a seat.
We'll be with you in a minute.

21:35.378 --> 21:36.879
All right.

21:43.428 --> 21:45.179
Hi, I'm Frank Gallagher,

21:45.263 --> 21:47.015
and, uh, that's Mo White.

21:47.098 --> 21:49.225
- He's running for Congress.
- Hello.

21:49.309 --> 21:52.145
And what is your name,
if you don't mind my asking?

21:52.228 --> 21:54.314
Evelyn.
Evelyn Thomas.

21:54.397 --> 21:55.732
Well, Evelyn,

21:55.815 --> 21:56.941
the reason we're here

21:57.025 --> 21:58.401
is that Mo is a

21:58.484 --> 22:00.153
proud South Sider,
just like yourself.

22:00.236 --> 22:02.822
He grew up two blocks
from here, over on Halsted,

22:02.905 --> 22:04.866
in what is now a crack den.

22:04.949 --> 22:06.659
Huh?

22:08.328 --> 22:09.787
And the point being, Evelyn,

22:09.871 --> 22:11.789
it's time for us to take pride

22:11.873 --> 22:13.207
in the South Side,

22:13.291 --> 22:16.085
and that starts
with good people like you.

22:16.169 --> 22:18.588
Sir, I don't give a rat's ass
about the South Side.

22:18.671 --> 22:19.672
I don't even
have a damn job.

22:21.299 --> 22:23.009
I don't either,

22:23.634 --> 22:26.346
which is why we need
Mo White in office!

22:26.429 --> 22:28.556
- Right, Mo?
- That's right.

22:31.225 --> 22:32.727
Mo wants to bring the jobs

22:32.810 --> 22:35.313
back to the working people
in the South Side,

22:35.396 --> 22:38.358
the people whose parents and
grandparents built this city!

22:38.441 --> 22:41.652
Pride is what made
the South Side safe

22:41.736 --> 22:43.613
and strong,
and that all starts

22:43.696 --> 22:45.114
with one thing,
which is what?

22:45.198 --> 22:46.032
A job.

22:46.115 --> 22:47.325
A job.
Bingo.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.494
Would you mind
if we put a sign on your yard

22:49.577 --> 22:50.912
to show your support for Mo?

22:51.496 --> 22:53.414
Yeah, I guess that'd be okay.
Sure.

22:53.498 --> 22:54.999
That's the South Side pride
I'm talking about.

22:55.083 --> 22:56.751
All right.
South Side pride.

22:56.834 --> 22:58.169
- You bet.
- I like that.

22:58.252 --> 22:59.712
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

23:00.213 --> 23:02.548
Oh, sorry.
$10, please.

23:03.257 --> 23:04.258
What?

23:04.342 --> 23:07.178
Uh, any contribution
is gratefully welcome.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.389
Uh, we suggest 10.

23:09.472 --> 23:11.849
Uh, some people are doing $20.

23:14.394 --> 23:16.312
Thank you, Evelyn.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.393
Sorry.

23:57.311 --> 23:58.729
Hey, um,

23:58.813 --> 24:01.357
have you achieved enlightenment
here before?

24:02.233 --> 24:03.317
I'm just--
I'm not

24:03.401 --> 24:04.777
really getting anything.

24:07.029 --> 24:08.573
Okay, uh,
rough estimate,

24:08.656 --> 24:10.199
how long does it normally take?

24:10.283 --> 24:12.702
For Buddha, it took one night.

24:12.785 --> 24:13.911
Well, that's not that bad.

24:13.995 --> 24:16.789
After ages and lives
of meditation.

24:16.873 --> 24:18.833
Right, okay.

24:19.417 --> 24:20.710
I don't have
that kind of time.

24:20.793 --> 24:21.794
I'm sorry.

24:21.878 --> 24:23.504
Uh, namaste.

25:13.179 --> 25:14.180

Hey, you okay?
What the hell happened to you?

25:30.905 --> 25:31.906
Fell off the jungle gym.

25:32.448 --> 25:33.824
Made it to the top, though.

25:33.908 --> 25:35.201
Good job.

25:35.284 --> 25:36.410
Does that hurt?

25:36.494 --> 25:37.620
- A little.
- Hi.

25:37.703 --> 25:39.163
- Are you the father?
- Ah, no.

25:39.247 --> 25:41.123
Uh, no, no, I'm the,
uh, brother.

25:42.208 --> 25:44.961
My dad's a drunk,
and my mom disappeared.

25:45.545 --> 25:46.587
Are you the guardian?

25:47.547 --> 25:49.382
No, not exactly.

25:49.465 --> 25:52.468
Okay, well, we'll get her
over to X-ray and set the arm.

25:52.552 --> 25:53.636
- Okay.
- And we can only release her

25:53.719 --> 25:56.305
to a parent or legal guardian.
Okay, sweetie.

25:56.389 --> 25:58.057
Okay.

26:00.351 --> 26:01.602
Right back this way.

26:06.274 --> 26:08.109
Hey, V.
Shot of Jaeger?

26:08.192 --> 26:09.527
Hey, Carl.
No way.

26:09.610 --> 26:10.695
What, I can die
for our country

26:10.778 --> 26:11.779
but can't get a simple liquor

26:11.862 --> 26:13.656
- till I'm 21?
- It's an incentive.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.533
You don't die,
you get to drink.

26:15.616 --> 26:17.535
But you're not gonna stay alive
in the South Side for long

26:17.618 --> 26:19.370
if you keep carrying
that little poodle around.

26:19.453 --> 26:21.289
It's a Yorkie,
and he has cancer.

26:21.372 --> 26:22.873
Probably only a few days
left to live.

26:25.251 --> 26:28.379
- For the dog, not you.
- Thank you.

26:28.462 --> 26:30.256
Whatcha doing
with a cancer dog, anyway?

26:30.339 --> 26:31.716
Community service.
Need it to get into

26:31.799 --> 26:33.801
- West Point.
- You're going to West Point?

26:34.343 --> 26:36.429
Want to, but it'll
probably never happen.

26:36.512 --> 26:37.888
Went to
Congressman Ubberman's office,

26:37.972 --> 26:39.098
see if he could recommend me,

26:39.181 --> 26:41.100
but I couldn't even
get an appointment.

26:41.183 --> 26:43.144
Ubberman.
He's a congressman?

26:43.227 --> 26:44.228
You know him?

26:44.312 --> 26:45.354
White guy?
Red face?

26:45.438 --> 26:46.647
- Sweaty?
- Yeah.

26:46.731 --> 26:48.149
I'll be damned!

26:48.232 --> 26:52.361
Hey, babe, did you know
that Wubby's a congressman?

26:52.445 --> 26:53.738
Seriously?

26:54.447 --> 26:55.448
When I was a dominatrix,

26:55.531 --> 26:56.866
he was one of my regulars.

26:56.949 --> 26:58.659
Dude used to like me
to whip him

26:58.743 --> 27:00.620
- and call him Wubby.
- And now he's a congressman.

27:01.912 --> 27:03.205
Do you still whip him?

27:03.289 --> 27:05.124
Ah, I retired years ago.

27:05.207 --> 27:07.418
Leather underwear is not
too good for my lady parts.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.129
Would you ever think
about coming out of retirement?

27:10.212 --> 27:11.589
- Never.
- Even if it meant giving

27:11.672 --> 27:12.757
an underprivileged
South Side kid

27:12.840 --> 27:14.550
a chance at achieving
his dream?

27:15.259 --> 27:17.178
S&M is not like
riding a bike, Carl.

27:17.261 --> 27:19.263
You can't just strap on
a pair of stilettos,

27:19.347 --> 27:20.598
pop a ball gag
in someone's mouth,

27:20.681 --> 27:21.766
and start to whipping them.

27:21.849 --> 27:23.851
That is not how you ride
a bike.

27:23.934 --> 27:25.853
I mean, that's okay.
Who's gonna let

27:25.936 --> 27:29.023
a poor South Side kid
become an officer, anyway?

27:29.106 --> 27:31.400
I'll just enlist,
embrace the suck,

27:31.484 --> 27:34.487
retire an old, disabled,
sad alcoholic.

27:34.570 --> 27:36.697
Maybe they'll let me
teach high school ROTC

27:36.781 --> 27:38.115
from my wheelchair
if I'm lucky.

27:38.949 --> 27:40.326
Come on, Bootsie.
I know you gotta eat.

28:06.310 --> 28:08.562
Hello.
I'm afraid you just missed

28:08.646 --> 28:10.147
the Chabot morning service.

28:10.231 --> 28:11.941
Oh, actually,
I was just, uh,

28:12.024 --> 28:13.526
looking for some answers.

28:13.609 --> 28:15.861
I'm the rabbi.
What's the question?

28:15.945 --> 28:18.406
If a religion
or a movement

28:18.489 --> 28:20.282
makes the world a better place,
does it matter

28:20.366 --> 28:21.450
if it goes
in a different direction

28:21.534 --> 28:22.535
than originally intended?

28:22.618 --> 28:25.246
Well, you pretty much
just summed up every religion.

28:25.329 --> 28:28.124
A better question might be
"What is God's will?"

28:28.207 --> 28:30.251
That's exactly
what I want to know.

28:30.334 --> 28:32.336
- Does God speak to you?
- I pray to God, yeah,

28:32.420 --> 28:33.713
but in the Jewish faith,

28:33.796 --> 28:35.214
we believe that the five books
of the Torah

28:35.297 --> 28:36.632
are the word of God.

28:36.716 --> 28:37.842
Kind of like the Bible.

28:37.925 --> 28:39.260
Mm, just the first part.

28:39.343 --> 28:43.180
Yeah, I read it.
So... God did speak to someone?

28:43.264 --> 28:44.598
To Moses, and Moses...

28:44.682 --> 28:45.683
wrote it down.

28:46.225 --> 28:48.728
But he spoke to him,
with words?

28:48.811 --> 28:51.272
Mm-hm, but only to Moses.

28:51.355 --> 28:54.066
No one else, ever?

28:54.150 --> 28:57.194
Not with words.
He did set a bush on fire once.

28:57.278 --> 29:00.239
What is it with religions
and setting things on fire?

29:16.589 --> 29:17.590
Hey.

29:17.673 --> 29:18.841
'Sup, nerd?

29:18.924 --> 29:20.593
Got a deal for you.

29:20.676 --> 29:22.386
- Vikes?
- What?

29:22.470 --> 29:24.305
No.
See that girl over there?

29:26.932 --> 29:29.185
Cracker Girl?
What about her?

29:29.268 --> 29:31.353
She wants to kill me,

29:31.437 --> 29:33.022
so what I was thinking

29:33.105 --> 29:34.732
what if I help you
get better grades?

29:35.191 --> 29:36.984
Like, with homework and stuff?

29:37.067 --> 29:38.694
For free?

29:38.778 --> 29:41.363
No, for protection
from Cracker Girl.

29:43.199 --> 29:45.785
I am failing the shit
out of this class.

29:46.535 --> 29:48.204
Okay, deal.

29:48.746 --> 29:49.789
Name's Todd.

29:49.872 --> 29:50.998
Liam.

29:57.797 --> 29:58.798
Yes?

29:58.881 --> 30:00.966
Oh, wrong house.
Sorry.

30:01.050 --> 30:03.052
Whoa, hold on a second.
Hold on a second.

30:03.135 --> 30:04.929
Uh,

30:05.012 --> 30:06.388
you a Wyman supporter?

30:06.472 --> 30:07.932
I am.

30:08.015 --> 30:10.309
Mo White.
And you are?

30:10.392 --> 30:11.560
Dee Sanders.

30:11.644 --> 30:14.104
Well, Dee, it is a pleasure
to meet you.

30:14.188 --> 30:17.191
Look, I know Wyman
is an African-American,

30:17.274 --> 30:18.859
but is that
why you're voting for her?

30:18.943 --> 30:20.653
Absolutely.
I always do.

30:20.736 --> 30:23.072
And that is terrific,
unless...

30:24.073 --> 30:26.242
you want your street
repaved.

30:26.325 --> 30:28.577
Look at these potholes, Dee.

30:28.661 --> 30:30.371
Wyman's been in Congress
for ten years.

30:30.454 --> 30:32.081
You still have potholes.

30:32.164 --> 30:35.417
We need to repair
our infrastructure.

30:35.501 --> 30:38.587
The South Side was
the crown jewel of Chicago:

30:38.671 --> 30:40.673
Clean, safe parks
where families

30:40.756 --> 30:43.717
and friends could picnic
and unwind.

30:43.801 --> 30:46.971
We were a community.
We looked out for each other.

30:47.054 --> 30:48.430
We--we were a family.

30:49.431 --> 30:51.100
Now,

30:51.183 --> 30:53.060
it's a liquor store
on every corner,

30:53.143 --> 30:54.895
graffiti on every sign.

30:54.979 --> 30:56.230
Yeah, it's just sad.

30:57.314 --> 30:59.650
My question to you is,

30:59.733 --> 31:01.193
will a Martin Luther King

31:01.277 --> 31:03.946
African Arts Center fix that?

31:04.029 --> 31:06.115
We could use that money
to repave your street,

31:06.198 --> 31:09.535
clean our parks, make
the South Side proud again,

31:09.618 --> 31:11.787
and that's why
I'm running for Congress, Dee.

31:11.871 --> 31:14.164
South Side pride.

31:14.248 --> 31:17.334
And I'd really appreciate
your vote, Dee.

31:17.418 --> 31:19.128
South Side pride.

31:20.546 --> 31:22.715

32:26.987 --> 32:28.322
Ugh!

32:30.366 --> 32:33.118
No.
No.

32:33.994 --> 32:35.746
Fuck.
What the hell do you wear

32:35.829 --> 32:38.749
to a 7:00 business meeting
at a hotel bar?

32:38.832 --> 32:40.960
- It's in a bar?
- Uh-huh.

32:41.043 --> 32:42.753
Where?

32:46.382 --> 32:47.383
Just gonna be you and Max,

32:47.466 --> 32:48.926
or will there be
other people there?

32:49.009 --> 32:51.053
Yeah, it's me and Max

32:51.136 --> 32:52.596
at a bar,
signing papers.

32:52.680 --> 32:54.223
Super exciting.

32:54.306 --> 32:55.891
Can I tag along?

32:55.975 --> 32:57.142
No.

32:59.687 --> 33:01.730
It'll make me look weak
if you're there.

33:01.814 --> 33:04.024
Like, "Hi, I'm just
a stupid woman.

33:04.108 --> 33:08.779
I can't sign a document myself,
?
so I brought along some dude.

33:10.364 --> 33:11.949
- Some dude?
- You know what I mean.

33:12.032 --> 33:13.242
No, I don't know
what you mean.

33:13.325 --> 33:15.661
I don't know
what the fuck we are.

33:15.744 --> 33:18.789
So now you want a
relationship? What the fuck?

33:18.872 --> 33:21.250
I was asking you how you feel
about us--normal question.

33:21.709 --> 33:24.003
Why are we having
this conversation now?

33:24.086 --> 33:25.254
Do you not trust me?

33:25.337 --> 33:27.089
I trust you.
I just...

33:28.090 --> 33:30.259
I don't trust Whitford.

33:30.843 --> 33:31.844
So you're jealous?

33:31.927 --> 33:33.846
Yeah, I'm fucking jealous.
Yeah.

33:34.888 --> 33:36.098
You happy?

33:37.725 --> 33:39.935
I'm doing a business deal
with Max.

33:40.602 --> 33:42.771
We're going to communicate.
We're going to text.

33:42.855 --> 33:44.106
We're gonna have meetings.

33:45.399 --> 33:47.735
If that makes you jealous,
I'm sorry.

33:48.944 --> 33:50.904
But it doesn't mean
that I'm gonna sleep with him.

33:53.115 --> 33:54.867
What it does mean

33:55.909 --> 33:57.327
is that I need
new fucking clothes.

34:38.118 --> 34:39.244
Sorry, dude.
I got here

34:39.328 --> 34:41.538
as quick as I could.
Is she all right?

34:41.622 --> 34:42.790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
She got a broken arm,

34:42.873 --> 34:45.167
but she's fine.
Look, I need you to be her dad.

34:45.667 --> 34:46.668
What?

34:46.752 --> 34:49.046
They'll only release her
to a parent or a guardian,

34:49.129 --> 34:50.839
so I need you
to pretend to be her dad.

34:50.923 --> 34:54.426
- Also, you're a drunk.
- I'm not doing that.

34:54.510 --> 34:56.053
Brad, come on,
help me out here.

34:56.136 --> 34:57.805
So you want me
to impersonate her father?

34:57.888 --> 34:59.389
Yeah, and sign some paperwork,

34:59.473 --> 35:00.641
but I already filled out
most of it.

35:00.724 --> 35:01.934
Well, why can't you do it?

35:02.017 --> 35:03.185
I'm not old enough
to be her dad,

35:03.268 --> 35:04.770
and plus, I already told them
I was her brother.

35:05.521 --> 35:06.980
So I'm your father, too?

35:07.064 --> 35:09.191
Yeah.
Father, stepfather, whatever.

35:09.274 --> 35:10.651
I'm not old enough
to be your father!

35:10.734 --> 35:11.944
Yeah, but you look old.

35:12.027 --> 35:14.321
Dude, I'm married now.

35:14.404 --> 35:16.156
Okay, I just got
my shit together.

35:16.240 --> 35:17.658
No way am I getting sucked

35:17.741 --> 35:19.910
into your weirdo
Gallagher vortex.

35:19.993 --> 35:21.245
What the fuck?
Brad, please.

35:21.328 --> 35:22.496
Look, if I don't get her
out of here,

35:22.579 --> 35:24.039
they're gonna call DCFS.

35:24.123 --> 35:25.874
You can't just walk
into an emergency room

35:25.958 --> 35:27.000
and pretend to be

35:27.084 --> 35:28.335
- some kid's da--
- Shh!

35:30.295 --> 35:31.588
This is the universe
telling you

35:31.672 --> 35:34.758
to do the right thing.
What if Xan was seriously hurt?

35:34.842 --> 35:37.052
You ever think about that?
You're not her parent.

35:37.136 --> 35:39.221
You wouldn't be able
to help her.

35:39.304 --> 35:40.639
- Look, Brad...
- Sorry, dude.

35:40.722 --> 35:42.182
Brad.

35:45.394 --> 35:46.854
Was that the father?

35:47.604 --> 35:48.856
Yeah.

35:48.939 --> 35:50.566
There he goes.

35:50.649 --> 35:52.234
Mr. Reliable.

35:56.905 --> 35:58.699
God, this feels good!

35:58.782 --> 36:01.118
We're doing important work
here, Frank!

36:01.201 --> 36:03.662
South Side loves you.
We're doing great.

36:03.745 --> 36:06.039
And I love the South Side.

36:06.123 --> 36:07.749
You know, the least I could do
is help these people

36:07.833 --> 36:10.711
remember what our neighborhood
stands for, huh?

36:10.794 --> 36:12.963
Mo White is back!

36:13.046 --> 36:14.631
Oh! Oh.

36:14.715 --> 36:15.757
What happened?

36:15.841 --> 36:16.925
Uh, uh, nothing, nothing.

36:17.009 --> 36:18.218
You sure?

36:18.302 --> 36:20.179
Yeah, yeah.
Everything's fine.

36:20.262 --> 36:22.181
Oh!

36:22.264 --> 36:24.600
Oh, geez.
L-le-le-let's go this way.

36:24.683 --> 36:27.311
What the hell is happening?
Are you all right?

36:27.394 --> 36:29.062
Never better.
Never better.

36:29.146 --> 36:30.480
Are you in pain?

36:30.564 --> 36:32.399
Mo, I'm your campaign manager.

36:32.482 --> 36:34.067
If you've got
a health condition,

36:34.151 --> 36:35.402
you gotta tell me about it.

36:35.485 --> 36:36.820
I don't have
a health condition!

36:36.904 --> 36:38.405
I just have to watch
where I walk.

36:38.488 --> 36:41.283
That's all.
Hey, is--is, uh,

36:41.366 --> 36:43.202
is there a school nearby?

36:43.285 --> 36:44.536
Why?

36:47.789 --> 36:48.999
Ankle bracelet.
Whenever I get

36:49.082 --> 36:51.335
within 100 yards of a school,

36:51.418 --> 36:53.545
- I get this little shock.
- What?

36:53.629 --> 36:55.464
Why do you wear
an ankle bracelet

36:55.547 --> 36:57.424
that shocks you
when you get near a school?

36:57.507 --> 36:59.509
It was years ago.
She told me

36:59.593 --> 37:01.136
she was 18, but...

37:01.220 --> 37:03.597
But?
But what, Mo?

37:03.680 --> 37:05.807
- She wasn't.
- What?

37:05.891 --> 37:07.059
Look, we were in love.

37:07.142 --> 37:08.477
We were together
for five years.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.020
She left me!

37:10.103 --> 37:11.647
On her 20th birthday.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.774
Oh, so she was 15.

37:13.857 --> 37:16.318
Frank, will you calm down?

37:16.401 --> 37:17.653
I paid my dues.

37:17.736 --> 37:19.029
Well, then why do you have
to wear

37:19.112 --> 37:20.239
a fucking ankle bracelet?

37:20.322 --> 37:21.907
It's only
for another six months,

37:21.990 --> 37:23.283
until...

37:23.367 --> 37:25.619
Until I'm off parole.

37:25.702 --> 37:27.454
Huh?
Frank, listen.

37:27.537 --> 37:29.498
Don't give up on me.

37:29.581 --> 37:32.042
These people...
huh?

37:32.125 --> 37:33.210
They need me.

Hi.
My name is Tyrell.

38:09.288 --> 38:10.706
What the hell is this?

38:10.789 --> 38:12.791
This is a consent form.

38:12.874 --> 38:15.794
From now on, any woman
you want to harass

38:15.877 --> 38:18.130
has to give
her written consent

38:18.213 --> 38:20.090
before you're allowed
to bother her.

38:20.173 --> 38:22.342
No woman's gonna sign this
unless she's hammered.

38:22.426 --> 38:23.593
She has to be sober.

38:24.303 --> 38:26.096
I'm never, ever
getting laid again.

38:26.722 --> 38:28.473
Did you ever think you were?

38:29.516 --> 38:32.019
Also, The Alibi will no longer
be serving

38:32.102 --> 38:34.187
any drink called
Sex on the Beach.

38:34.271 --> 38:36.898
It will only be known
as "The Beach."

38:36.982 --> 38:39.234
What is this, Acapulco?
Nobody drinks those.

38:39.318 --> 38:40.569
Women do.

38:40.652 --> 38:42.195
TV-wise,
while we'll still be showing

38:42.279 --> 38:44.448
the White Sox games,
we're gonna be introducing

38:44.531 --> 38:47.075
some alternative programming
for the ladies.

38:47.159 --> 38:49.119
- Like what?
- Cooking shows?

38:49.202 --> 38:50.203
<i>Ellen?</i>

38:50.287 --> 38:51.371
<i>This is Us.</i>

38:51.913 --> 38:53.665
Let's not get carried away,
Kermit.

38:54.041 --> 38:55.042
What?

39:10.140 --> 39:12.351
Got it on eBay for $21.

39:13.060 --> 39:14.603
Really?

39:14.686 --> 39:15.896
No.
That thing's, like,

39:15.979 --> 39:17.773
300 years old.

39:17.856 --> 39:20.359
You thinking about converting?

39:20.442 --> 39:21.860
What?

39:21.943 --> 39:23.445
You're wearing a yarmulke.

39:23.528 --> 39:25.906
Ah, uh, y--no.

39:25.989 --> 39:28.116
Just, uh, looking around.

39:28.950 --> 39:31.286
Well, let me know
if you see anything you like.

39:33.372 --> 39:35.749
Wait.

39:35.832 --> 39:38.001
Do you know what God
wants us to do next?

39:38.085 --> 39:40.420
- I have a pretty good idea.
- You do?

39:40.504 --> 39:41.713
How?
Did God talk to you?

39:41.797 --> 39:43.215
No.

39:44.132 --> 39:45.634
Someone's gotta have answers.

39:45.717 --> 39:47.969
It's called the Bible.
Read it.

39:48.845 --> 39:50.764
This stuff's been figured out
since day one.

39:50.847 --> 39:52.307
Day 39.
Whatever.

39:52.391 --> 39:54.226
Whenever Eve ate that apple.

39:54.309 --> 39:56.061
You really believe
there was an Eve?

39:56.144 --> 39:57.145
Don't overthink it.

39:57.229 --> 39:59.314
You want to know
what God wants you to do?

39:59.398 --> 40:01.358
Start with
the Ten Commandments.

40:01.441 --> 40:03.110
They're commandments.

40:08.824 --> 40:09.825
Okay.

40:11.451 --> 40:14.704
Greetings, Mo White supporters.
Hey, Kev,

40:14.788 --> 40:17.541
couple of cold ones
for your future congressman

40:17.624 --> 40:20.335
and his loyal campaign manager.

40:20.419 --> 40:23.213
And two whiskey chasers,
please.

40:23.296 --> 40:26.550
Gentlemen, if I could have
your attention, please.

40:26.633 --> 40:28.385
The fact that you
might want me

40:28.468 --> 40:30.762
- as your congressman again...
- Kev!

40:30.846 --> 40:32.264
That means a lot.

40:32.347 --> 40:36.226
I would like to clear
my existing tab,

40:36.309 --> 40:38.895
and here's a hundie
for the next one.

40:38.979 --> 40:40.230
Thank you, my good man.

40:40.313 --> 40:42.065
Thank you, Frank.

40:42.149 --> 40:44.359
And nobody understands
the people of the South Side

40:44.443 --> 40:46.611
- better than Mo White.
- That's right.

40:46.695 --> 40:48.238
- You want better jobs!
- Yeah.

40:48.321 --> 40:50.282
- You want safer streets.
- Yeah.

40:50.365 --> 40:51.867
You want
more affordable housing.

40:51.950 --> 40:53.243
- Yeah.
- Well, then,

40:53.326 --> 40:56.580
I humbly, humbly,
ask for your vote.

40:56.663 --> 40:57.747
Cheers.

40:57.831 --> 40:59.666
Another round!

41:02.794 --> 41:04.546
And, uh, you are?

41:04.629 --> 41:07.883
If I could just have you
sign this right here.

41:07.966 --> 41:09.676
Thank you.

41:09.759 --> 41:11.845
Consent form.

41:11.928 --> 41:13.930
Here we go.
For the thousandth time,

41:14.014 --> 41:15.432
there was no way I could know

41:15.515 --> 41:17.267
that girl was only 15.

41:17.350 --> 41:18.602
What?

41:18.685 --> 41:20.353
And my relationship
with Heather

41:20.437 --> 41:22.105
is long behind me now.

41:22.189 --> 41:24.149
And did you know
that in China,

41:24.232 --> 41:26.526
the age of consent is 13?

41:26.610 --> 41:28.612
And that is a country
on the rise.

41:28.695 --> 41:30.238
Shit.
Okay, thank you, Mo.

41:30.322 --> 41:32.032
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

41:32.115 --> 41:34.075
All right.
We will see you at the polls.

41:34.159 --> 41:36.453
I remember this dude!
They hiked

41:36.536 --> 41:38.497
the Appalachian Trail together.
Said he was

41:38.580 --> 41:40.165
helping her get a merit badge.

41:40.248 --> 41:42.792
Mo left Congress to care
for his dying wife.

41:42.876 --> 41:44.920
Mo left Congress
to bang a 15-year-old.

41:45.003 --> 41:47.422
She said she was 18,
and you should've seen her.

41:47.506 --> 41:50.258
Look at this, you tell me
this girl looks 15, huh?

41:50.342 --> 41:52.719
Jesus!
She looks like she's ten.

41:52.802 --> 41:53.970
12, maybe.

41:54.054 --> 41:56.014
Okay, okay.
Did Mo make a mistake?

41:56.097 --> 41:57.557
Yes, he did.

41:57.641 --> 41:59.267
But he regrets it,

41:59.351 --> 42:02.145
and what's more important,
he paid for it.

42:02.229 --> 42:03.980
He went to jail.

42:04.064 --> 42:07.859
He's been rehabilitated.
The system works.

42:07.943 --> 42:10.362
I think what we all
have to keep in mind here

42:10.445 --> 42:13.406
is that Mo's
a great congressman,

42:13.490 --> 42:16.660
and before that,
he was the best football coach

42:16.743 --> 42:18.703
that Robert E. Lee High
ever had,

42:18.787 --> 42:21.122
and do you know
what's even more American

42:21.206 --> 42:22.541
than football?

42:22.624 --> 42:24.543
Second chances.

42:24.626 --> 42:27.629
Hell, this whole country
was built on second chances.

42:27.712 --> 42:29.631
O.J. got one.

42:29.714 --> 42:31.508
He blew it, but he got one.

42:31.591 --> 42:34.010
Teddy Kennedy, the man
you don't want behind the wheel

42:34.094 --> 42:36.096
if you need a ride
to the other end of the bridge?

42:36.179 --> 42:38.306
Reelected seven times.

42:38.390 --> 42:40.850
And admit it,
we're all pulling for Tiger

42:40.934 --> 42:43.353
every time he walks
on the course.

42:43.436 --> 42:46.356
My point is,
we all make mistakes.

42:46.439 --> 42:49.359
Don't we all
want a second chance?

42:49.442 --> 42:51.611
Man, I know I do.

42:51.695 --> 42:53.154
And for the South Side,

42:53.238 --> 42:56.658
Mo White is that second chance.

43:00.036 --> 43:01.830
You got my vote, Mo.

43:01.913 --> 43:03.081
Mo White.

43:03.164 --> 43:04.791
- Mo White!
- Mo White!

43:04.874 --> 43:06.918
Mo White! Mo White!

43:07.002 --> 43:09.045
Mo White! Mo White!

43:09.129 --> 43:11.172
Mo White! Mo White!

43:11.256 --> 43:12.757
Mo White!
Mo White!

43:12.841 --> 43:14.467
Another round!
Let's go!

43:18.430 --> 43:20.890
Oh, yeah!

43:20.974 --> 43:22.892
I'm sorry to bother you,
Mr. Congressman,

43:22.976 --> 43:24.227
but there's a, uh...

43:24.311 --> 43:27.355
- Lenora.
- Lenora here to see you.

43:27.439 --> 43:28.648
She says
she has an appointment,

43:28.732 --> 43:31.276
but I don't have it
on the calendar.

43:35.989 --> 43:38.033
Congressman Ubberman
will see you now.

43:38.116 --> 43:39.618
Thank you so much.

43:55.258 --> 43:56.718
Hi, I'm Denise.

43:56.801 --> 43:57.886
Are you Alexandra's guardian?

43:57.969 --> 43:59.471
- Um, yeah.
- Great.

43:59.554 --> 44:00.555
Can I have
your driver's license

44:00.639 --> 44:02.223
and insurance card, please?

44:02.307 --> 44:03.683
Um...

44:05.143 --> 44:06.895
look, Denise, uh,

44:06.978 --> 44:09.105
technically, I'm not
her legal guardian.

44:09.189 --> 44:10.690
All right?
But I'm--

44:10.774 --> 44:12.942
I'm looking out for her
until her mother gets back.

44:13.818 --> 44:15.945
But you don't know
when that's gonna be?

44:16.571 --> 44:17.822
No.

44:18.448 --> 44:20.241
You know where she is,
though?

44:21.284 --> 44:22.494
No.

44:23.328 --> 44:26.247
Okay, I'm a social worker
here at the hospital.

44:26.331 --> 44:28.208
They sent me down here
because they have concerns

44:28.291 --> 44:29.751
about Alexandra's household.

44:30.418 --> 44:31.503
What does that mean?

44:31.586 --> 44:34.047
You say you're her brother,
and then you're her guardian.

44:34.130 --> 44:35.924
A man shows up and then leaves,
and now you say

44:36.007 --> 44:37.676
you're taking care of her
until her mother comes back,

44:37.759 --> 44:39.135
but she said her mother's
not coming back.

44:39.219 --> 44:41.179
Okay, I understand
that that sounds--

44:41.262 --> 44:44.057
We will sort all this out
when DCFS gets here.

44:46.142 --> 44:47.519
Right.

45:08.623 --> 45:11.459
You ready?

45:11.543 --> 45:14.337
Wubby missed you so much.

45:14.879 --> 45:16.756
It's been a while.

45:16.840 --> 45:18.800
- What made you--
- No talking!

45:18.883 --> 45:20.009
Harder.

45:20.093 --> 45:21.553
What did I just say?

45:21.636 --> 45:23.513
- Harder!
- You want harder?

45:23.596 --> 45:26.182
Oh, my God!

45:28.601 --> 45:30.061
There's a kid...

45:30.145 --> 45:33.189
I want you to recommend
to West Point.

45:33.273 --> 45:35.150
Oh!

45:35.233 --> 45:37.318
Good kid.
Big heart.

45:37.402 --> 45:38.403
Born to serve.

45:38.486 --> 45:40.238
Ow!

45:41.990 --> 45:45.618
I already recommended someone!

45:45.702 --> 45:47.871
- Oh!
- Bitch, I'm not asking.

45:48.913 --> 45:50.540
What's his name?

45:51.291 --> 45:53.251
Carl Gallagher.

45:53.334 --> 45:54.753
Ah!

45:57.630 --> 45:59.257
Maybe--maybe I could, uh,

45:59.340 --> 46:01.134
un-recommend the other kid.

46:01.217 --> 46:02.218
Maybe?

46:02.302 --> 46:03.470
<i>Oh!</i>

46:03.553 --> 46:04.679
<i>Yes!</i>

46:04.763 --> 46:07.098

46:07.182 --> 46:10.310

Come on with me, all right?

47:18.586 --> 47:20.755
<i>Code blue.
Code blue.</i>

47:40.066 --> 47:41.317
Hey.

47:41.401 --> 47:44.362
Oh, damn, girl!
What you all dressed up for?

47:44.445 --> 47:45.822
I could ask you the same thing.

47:45.905 --> 47:47.365
A story for another time.

47:47.448 --> 47:48.700
I gotta look professional.

47:48.783 --> 47:49.826
I got a meeting.

47:49.909 --> 47:51.619
Oh, well, you look good.

47:51.703 --> 47:53.162
Thank you.
It's H&M.

47:53.246 --> 47:54.956
Gonna return this shit
tomorrow.

47:55.039 --> 47:57.041
Meeting with a man
or a woman?

47:57.125 --> 47:58.418
Does it matter?
I'd wear exactly

47:58.501 --> 48:00.545
the same thing, regardless.

48:00.628 --> 48:01.963
So a man.

48:02.046 --> 48:03.882
Look, I need this deal
to happen, okay?

48:03.965 --> 48:05.675
If I look good, can't hurt.

48:05.758 --> 48:06.968
It's called
dress for success.

48:07.051 --> 48:08.845
Preaching to the choir.

48:08.928 --> 48:10.972
So, are there gonna be drinks
at this meeting?

48:11.055 --> 48:13.600
No, no, we're just
gonna sign some papers.

48:13.683 --> 48:16.060
Uh, might have a little
champagne to celebrate.

48:16.144 --> 48:17.770
Oh, nice.
Where?

48:17.854 --> 48:19.898
At a hotel downtown.

48:20.940 --> 48:22.442
Ford cool with that?

48:24.569 --> 48:25.987
Fucking Ford.

48:26.571 --> 48:28.114
He's acting weird.

48:28.197 --> 48:30.074
Like, jealous.

48:30.158 --> 48:31.534
Mm.
Wonder why.

48:31.618 --> 48:32.994
Mm, it's not like that.

48:33.077 --> 48:34.704
Then what's wrong?

48:34.787 --> 48:36.748
Why is he bringing this up now?
I mean, suddenly,

48:36.831 --> 48:38.082
he wants to be in
a relationship

48:38.166 --> 48:39.292
'cause I got a meeting
with a guy?

48:40.293 --> 48:41.461
Is the guy hot?

48:42.629 --> 48:43.922
Yeah, he's hot as fuck.

48:44.005 --> 48:45.590
Yeah, but the--

48:45.673 --> 48:47.008
why is it all on me?

48:47.091 --> 48:48.760
Why can't Ford and I
just hang out?

48:48.843 --> 48:51.220
Why does it have to turn
to some official thing?

48:51.304 --> 48:53.097
Because when it's not
an official thing,

48:53.181 --> 48:54.557
people get hurt.

48:54.641 --> 48:56.517
- Hey, what's up, Fiona?
- Hi, Kev.

48:56.601 --> 48:58.311
When people leave
their options open,

48:58.394 --> 48:59.646
you can't trust each other.

48:59.729 --> 49:02.065
When I started dating Kev,
I was like, "You're my man,

49:02.148 --> 49:04.067
"I'm your girl, and if you're
not happy with that,

49:04.150 --> 49:05.401
I'll kill you in your sleep."

49:05.485 --> 49:06.653
It's true.

49:07.570 --> 49:08.571
What's that?

49:08.655 --> 49:12.116
I'm trying to make a logo
or a symbol or something

49:12.200 --> 49:13.534
so I can put it in the window

49:13.618 --> 49:15.244
so women know
that they're safe here.

49:16.079 --> 49:17.080
- Hey, Kev.
- They're not.

49:17.163 --> 49:19.332
I know. That's why I'm doing
a symbol, or a logo.

49:19.415 --> 49:21.042
I need a quick beer
and a bump.

49:21.125 --> 49:24.462
This might be the hardest
I have ever worked.

49:24.545 --> 49:26.381
Where's your candidate?
Kissing babies?

49:26.464 --> 49:28.508
I hope he's just kissing.

49:28.591 --> 49:30.259
Disgusting pedophile.

49:30.343 --> 49:32.303
Which is why
there's no way in hell

49:32.387 --> 49:35.264
he's ever gonna win.
I just need him to shut up,

49:35.348 --> 49:36.975
or else people
are gonna stop contributing

49:37.058 --> 49:37.976
to the campaign.

49:38.059 --> 49:39.852
You are unbelievable.

49:40.853 --> 49:43.231
You know me,
daughter of my dreams.

49:43.314 --> 49:45.942
I never stop thinking
about tomorrow.

49:46.693 --> 49:47.944
Kev.

49:48.027 --> 49:50.613
Can I get a bump
of Jamie, please?

49:50.697 --> 49:54.075
Hey, wasn't that
Bill Clinton's campaign song?

49:54.158 --> 49:56.536
"Don't Stop Thinking
About Tomorrow"?

49:57.912 --> 49:59.956
That's what we need.

50:00.039 --> 50:01.958
A campaign song.

50:02.041 --> 50:03.459
Well...

50:06.629 --> 50:08.798
Ugh!

50:08.881 --> 50:10.508
Democracy never sleeps.

50:10.591 --> 50:13.094
Unless it's
with a 15-year-old.

50:17.181 --> 50:18.641
Hi.

50:19.350 --> 50:21.060
Hey.

50:21.728 --> 50:23.563
Not even gonna ask.

50:25.773 --> 50:27.942
Totally forgot
I was wearing it.

50:29.902 --> 50:31.487
How did you know for sure
you were gay?

50:32.530 --> 50:34.323
'Cause I was having sex
with a man.

50:34.407 --> 50:35.658
Why?

50:35.742 --> 50:37.702
I don't know.

50:37.785 --> 50:39.579
I think I might be gay.

50:39.662 --> 50:40.663
You're not gay.

50:40.747 --> 50:42.331
How do you know?

50:42.415 --> 50:43.791
Where is this coming from?
Is this 'cause

50:43.875 --> 50:46.294
- you're a welder now?
- No.

50:46.377 --> 50:48.296
I don't know.
I...

50:48.379 --> 50:49.380
I've just been feeling ways

50:49.464 --> 50:50.757
that I've never felt before.

50:51.382 --> 50:53.009
Have you had sex
with another woman?

50:53.092 --> 50:54.552
Yeah. I did, once.

50:54.635 --> 50:56.179
It was a long time ago,
but I

50:56.262 --> 50:57.388
let a woman
I was babysitting for

50:57.472 --> 50:58.931
go down on me.

50:59.932 --> 51:00.933
Really?

51:01.017 --> 51:02.351
Yeah.
Got a great tip.

51:02.435 --> 51:05.980
- Did you return the favor?
- No.

51:06.064 --> 51:08.483
Yeah, you're not gay.
You're a pillow princess.

51:08.566 --> 51:10.610
Have you been
with a girl since?

51:10.693 --> 51:11.694
Yep.
I just made out with one

51:11.778 --> 51:12.779
in the bathroom.

51:12.862 --> 51:14.197
Okay, well,
that's a start.

51:14.280 --> 51:15.698
What kind of porn
do you like?

51:15.782 --> 51:16.783
I don't watch porn.

51:16.866 --> 51:19.285
Bullshit.
Everyone watches porn.

51:21.370 --> 51:23.164
- I'm at least bisexual.
- No.

51:23.247 --> 51:25.083
You're not.

51:25.166 --> 51:27.335
Why do you keep telling me
what I'm not?

51:27.418 --> 51:30.463
I thought Gay Jesus was all
about love and acceptance.

51:32.340 --> 51:33.633
Sorry.

51:34.884 --> 51:36.636
Yeah, I don't know
what we're about anymore.

51:36.719 --> 51:38.888
The whole Gay Jesus thing

51:38.971 --> 51:40.556
has gotten
completely out of hand.

51:40.640 --> 51:44.310
I mean, people are doing
crazy shit.

51:44.393 --> 51:47.063
Apparently,
now I'm the gay Che.

51:47.146 --> 51:48.689
Lately, I'm just feeling like--

51:48.773 --> 51:50.233
Hey, news flash:

51:50.316 --> 51:52.610
you're not Jesus,
and you're not gay Che.

51:52.693 --> 51:55.404
You're a bipolar Gallagher
who doesn't take his meds.

51:55.488 --> 51:56.739
So why don't you stop trying
to save the world

51:56.823 --> 51:57.949
and save yourself?

51:59.075 --> 52:00.660
I don't know what I am anymore.

52:00.743 --> 52:02.829
At least you know you're gay.

52:02.912 --> 52:04.330
Yeah.

52:10.419 --> 52:12.046
Lenora...

52:12.130 --> 52:14.882
obviously thinks
very highly of you.

52:14.966 --> 52:16.926
Yes, sir.

52:17.009 --> 52:18.427
So...

52:23.724 --> 52:26.310
I know of no finer candidate

52:26.394 --> 52:29.355
for admittance to West Point

52:29.438 --> 52:32.316
than Carl... Gallagher.

52:35.611 --> 52:37.488
