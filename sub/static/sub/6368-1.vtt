What's up, Hondo?

01:45.387 --> 01:47.823
You guys got nothing on me.

01:47.857 --> 01:50.558
- You killed a cop.
- Allegedly.

01:50.893 --> 01:52.460
And then you bragged about it.

01:52.729 --> 01:54.096
<i>So arrest me, sweetheart.</i>

01:54.396 --> 01:55.764
All right? You got nothing tying me

01:56.065 --> 01:57.565
to that nigger friend of yours.

01:57.900 --> 02:00.201
Okay, why don't you see
if you can make it stick?

02:00.236 --> 02:02.737
No. You killed our friend.

02:04.240 --> 02:05.507
We're not gonna arrest you.

02:05.774 --> 02:07.308
What are you talkin' about?

02:07.343 --> 02:10.745
You're right, we couldn't make it stick.

02:12.581 --> 02:15.016
You're fucking cops, okay?
Arrest me.

02:15.251 --> 02:16.751
See any badges?

02:18.253 --> 02:19.754
You're the fuckin' sheriff!

02:22.590 --> 02:25.425
- Allegedly.
- Oh, fu...

Where do you go?

05:20.095 --> 05:21.262
What do you mean?

05:21.464 --> 05:23.965
It's like...

05:24.266 --> 05:25.767
you can't even look at me.

05:28.638 --> 05:29.805
It's nothing like that.

05:38.613 --> 05:41.349
You know, maybe you
should really think about

05:41.383 --> 05:42.717
getting a new place.

05:43.118 --> 05:46.454
Eh, it has a certain
old-school charm, no?

05:47.789 --> 05:49.858
No.

05:50.993 --> 05:52.793
Well, you can't beat the rent.

05:56.465 --> 06:00.601
I mean, I get that this isn't a
relationship, and I'm fine with that.

06:03.638 --> 06:04.938
I have to go to work.

06:05.340 --> 06:07.608
You could at least hire a cleaning
service or something.

06:07.976 --> 06:10.177
I don't like people touching my things.

06:10.478 --> 06:12.279
- Your things?
- Yeah.

06:12.313 --> 06:16.449
- These aren't your things.
- Okay, time to get up.

06:16.817 --> 06:19.052
This is where Sugar's
old crap goes to die.

06:19.087 --> 06:21.889
Yeah, this coming from the
girl who lives in an Airstream.

06:25.325 --> 06:28.595
You just seem like somebody who
could use a friend is all I'm saying.

06:28.996 --> 06:31.664
We're just two adults
having sex in a motel room.

06:31.999 --> 06:33.600
You know what? 
Fuck it.

06:35.202 --> 06:36.836
Come here.

06:37.805 --> 06:39.338
Great sex.

06:40.674 --> 06:42.841
Always room for improvement.

06:49.749 --> 06:52.751
- Hey, Carrie, you're early.
- I couldn't sleep.

06:54.388 --> 06:57.890
<i>- Order up.
- Eggs Benedict, hold the sauce.</i>

06:57.924 --> 06:59.491
<i>Man, you guys.</i>

06:59.893 --> 07:02.360
- Take the back five, okay?
- You got it.

07:05.732 --> 07:07.499
Who had an eggs Florentine?

07:11.471 --> 07:16.041
- You want some eggs?
- No, thanks.

07:28.887 --> 07:31.989
- You hear that?
- What?

07:32.223 --> 07:33.925
Quiet.

07:39.064 --> 07:40.832
- You missing Job?
- No.

07:41.232 --> 07:45.503
I'm just sayin' how
nice and quiet it's been

07:45.938 --> 07:49.340
since you got back from your
little trip to New York last month.

07:49.574 --> 07:50.907
You got a problem with quiet?

07:53.979 --> 07:57.814
On the contrary.
I'm gonna miss it when it's gone.

08:05.953 --> 08:07.374
<i>Yes?</i>

08:11.929 --> 08:13.530
In regards to the matter we discussed,

08:13.564 --> 08:15.799
you should come down to the basement.

08:15.833 --> 08:17.767
- Now?
- Yes.

08:29.480 --> 08:31.780
Is he ready to talk?

08:33.616 --> 08:35.518
Looks like you two made
quite a night of it.

08:37.120 --> 08:38.621
I know, I know.
Burton's interview style

08:38.955 --> 08:41.957
can be a little rigid at times,
but he's very precise.

08:43.626 --> 08:45.093
These cuts will all heal.

08:45.495 --> 08:47.997
You just make sure you live
long enough to let that happen.

08:48.297 --> 08:50.900
Do you understand?
Good.

08:51.300 --> 08:54.503
Now, has Jim Cage been supplying
Philadelphia with Molly?

08:54.637 --> 08:55.737
Yeah.

08:56.139 --> 08:58.340
And he's been selling
to Frazier exclusively?

08:58.641 --> 09:02.977
They cut your prices.
He's got the whole territory locked up.

09:04.813 --> 09:05.980
Thank you for your cooperation.

09:08.684 --> 09:09.984
Wait!

09:20.495 --> 09:23.064
Please. Please help me.

09:31.339 --> 09:32.664
Pl...

09:34.676 --> 09:37.044
That's not really my thing.

09:41.849 --> 09:44.051
Stay the fuck away from me!

09:51.192 --> 09:53.093
Fruit platter and oatmeal with soy milk.

09:53.360 --> 09:56.529
- And an egg white omelet.
- Hi, Carrie.

09:56.864 --> 09:59.265
<i>How are you?
How are the kids?</i>

09:59.533 --> 10:00.633
Everyone's great. Thanks.

10:00.901 --> 10:05.671
<i>Eggs over easy.
Side of bacon, crisp.</i>

10:05.872 --> 10:07.273
Thank you.

10:09.042 --> 10:12.445
I give her a lot of credit.
It can't be easy, huh?

10:16.382 --> 10:19.974
- You okay?
- Yeah.

10:34.667 --> 10:37.603
- Mr. Proctor.
- Sheriff, Deputy.

10:37.903 --> 10:41.240
Charging me with unlicensed firearms.
That was the best you could do?

10:41.741 --> 10:43.275
Eh, just getting the ball
rolling till I can charge you

10:43.309 --> 10:45.326
- with the Longshadow murder.
- I'm sure you are,

10:45.332 --> 10:47.446
but thanks to you I have
an airtight alibi, don't I?

10:47.747 --> 10:49.080
You had me locked up, remember?

10:49.115 --> 10:51.816
The way I see it, a guy like you,
I'll get another shot.

10:52.284 --> 10:55.086
Yeah, but your track record isn't
exactly giving me much cause for concern.

10:55.287 --> 10:57.088
See you around, Kai.

11:02.862 --> 11:05.463
I still come in every day
expecting to see Emmett there.

11:05.497 --> 11:07.165
Yeah, me, too.

11:11.603 --> 11:12.336
Hey, morning.

11:12.604 --> 11:13.638
- Hey.
- Raven.

11:13.805 --> 11:15.773
Uh...

11:16.941 --> 11:21.078
listen, I know that I...
have some pretty big shoes to fill here.

11:21.446 --> 11:23.313
- Huge.
- Yeah, yeah, I get that.

11:24.949 --> 11:26.483
But all I did was answer an ad.

11:26.818 --> 11:29.286
I'm sorry.
This can't be easy for you.

11:29.654 --> 11:32.656
It's not, but it gets my
family off the reservation.

11:32.691 --> 11:35.893
And I gotta tell you after
working six years for KPD,

11:36.327 --> 11:39.563
it's great to be working in an
actual functioning police station.

11:39.830 --> 11:42.732
"Functional."
That's us.

11:45.069 --> 11:49.806
- Hey, Hood, you got a minute?
- Uh, yeah. What's up?

11:53.311 --> 11:55.411
Hondo file.

11:55.813 --> 11:57.379
Medical examiner said
they're not gonna send out

11:57.681 --> 11:58.881
for ballistics on the bullets.

11:59.183 --> 12:03.720
They're prioritizing, I guess. And I...
I canvassed the area.

12:04.021 --> 12:05.888
No one seems to have seen anything.

12:05.923 --> 12:09.859
So, basically, the official consensus is

12:10.160 --> 12:12.127
three anonymous shooters
did the world a favor

12:12.161 --> 12:14.129
and nobody's gonna lose any sleep over

12:14.497 --> 12:17.132
a dead neo-Nazi with multiple priors.

12:17.367 --> 12:19.868
- So...
- Sounds good to me.

12:20.036 --> 12:21.837
Okay.

12:25.842 --> 12:27.175
Something else?

12:31.013 --> 12:33.181
Are you even fazed by this?

12:35.918 --> 12:38.053
- We executed a man, Hood.
- He killed one of us.

12:38.087 --> 12:39.687
I know that.

12:41.858 --> 12:43.225
I understand.

12:49.197 --> 12:51.733
You've done this sort of thing before?

12:51.900 --> 12:55.403
What?
Killed a man?

12:57.706 --> 13:02.576
- No, executed him.
- Brock...

13:02.744 --> 13:09.078
- you'll be okay. Now let's go.
- Let's just not make a habit of it, okay? I...

13:13.271 --> 13:15.572
Does Father know that we've
been meeting like this?

13:18.776 --> 13:21.345
To what end?

13:21.746 --> 13:24.080
You don't think he'll join us, do you?

13:27.252 --> 13:28.552
But you would think at
one point he'd want to know

13:28.753 --> 13:30.987
what became of his son.

13:32.290 --> 13:34.090
Let's be honest, Kai.

13:36.260 --> 13:39.295
Who you've become is
exactly what he is afraid of.

13:43.300 --> 13:45.301
How is my granddaughter doing?

13:47.504 --> 13:49.939
She's fine.

13:57.263 --> 13:59.231
<i>Hit him!</i>

14:23.522 --> 14:27.859
<i>The fire trials
are a sacred Redbone tradition</i>

14:28.160 --> 14:32.397
<i>to prove yourself a worthy leader.
Times have changed</i>

14:32.665 --> 14:36.033
<i>and the Redbones must change with them.</i>

14:38.637 --> 14:40.304
Wrong.

14:57.489 --> 15:01.091
- Sheriff's Department.
- Billy. Billy.

15:01.493 --> 15:03.226
You have to press that
interface button first

15:03.661 --> 15:04.661
in order to pull the call
off Alma's switchboard.

15:04.696 --> 15:06.263
- Thanks.
- Got it?

15:06.297 --> 15:07.698
- Yeah.
- Time and experience, son.

15:09.634 --> 15:12.335
<i>Interface.</i>

15:12.704 --> 15:14.704
<i>- There you go.
- Sheriff's Department.</i>

15:15.172 --> 15:17.473
Deputy Lotus stepped away
for a moment. Can I help you?

15:17.708 --> 15:21.778
Do you see him now?
Are all your doors locked?

15:21.812 --> 15:25.181
Can you check them for me, please?
And tell me your address.

15:26.183 --> 15:29.219
Got it.
Okay, we're on our way, ma'am.

15:29.520 --> 15:31.220
<i>Okay, we got a prowler call.</i>

15:31.254 --> 15:33.255
Lady said there's a guy
hiding in her shrubbery

15:33.557 --> 15:35.024
- in her backyard.
- Whoa, whoa.

15:36.359 --> 15:40.062
- Is it 63 Oakwood Lane?
- Yeah. How'd you know?

15:41.899 --> 15:43.265
Time and experience, son.

15:44.902 --> 15:46.535
<i>I'll get it.</i>

15:48.571 --> 15:51.773
- We should both go...
- No, no, I need you to stay here

15:52.075 --> 15:54.443
and hold down the fort, all right?

16:00.583 --> 16:03.552
Times have not changed.

16:04.887 --> 16:07.522
We are still being raped and plundered

16:07.890 --> 16:11.827
by the white man like we
have been for 500 years.

16:12.227 --> 16:14.095
What exactly is it you think
we're going to celebrate?

16:14.396 --> 16:16.331
You left, Chayton. I'm in charge.

16:16.599 --> 16:18.667
- I understand.
- Do you?

16:18.901 --> 16:22.103
- I don't want to fight you.
- I don't want to fight you, either,

16:22.571 --> 16:25.006
but that's how we do it unless
you see another way, Chayton.

16:25.240 --> 16:28.443
- You could just step down.
- Would you?

16:56.937 --> 16:59.806
- Had enough?
- Yeah. Yeah.

17:30.670 --> 17:33.672
- We done?
- Yeah.

17:39.312 --> 17:42.480
We are here, all of us,

17:42.815 --> 17:44.550
to fight in a war that we will never win

17:44.851 --> 17:47.753
because it was lost by
our people centuries ago.

17:47.787 --> 17:51.056
We will never reclaim our country.

17:51.490 --> 17:54.225
But I've come back because
I'd rather die fighting

17:54.260 --> 17:57.162
than to live like
a slave in my own land.

17:58.664 --> 18:02.733
It's time we took something back.

18:25.023 --> 18:26.356
Hello?

18:33.531 --> 18:34.898
Another prowler, huh?

18:40.371 --> 18:41.705
Gotta stop it with these
prowler calls, Emily.

18:41.739 --> 18:44.541
All right?
Look, what if I was out

18:44.576 --> 18:45.709
when Billy Raven took that call?

18:46.043 --> 18:47.611
Who the hell's Billy Raven?

18:49.413 --> 18:52.048
- New deputy.
- Oh.

18:53.350 --> 18:55.551
- Poor Emmett.
- I gotta get back.

18:55.886 --> 18:58.387
Just have a drink with me.

18:58.723 --> 19:01.124
<i>- Em, I'm on duty.
- You're always on duty.</i>

19:01.391 --> 19:03.926
- That's why we got divorced.
- No, we got divorced

19:03.927 --> 19:06.462
because you were fucking Elliot Granger.

19:06.896 --> 19:09.832
I was fucking Elliot Granger
because you were never home.

19:10.100 --> 19:11.601
Classic chicken and the egg debate.

19:15.239 --> 19:16.606
Just sit with me.

19:19.109 --> 19:20.575
Please?

19:25.581 --> 19:27.883
I just get lonely sometimes.

19:28.251 --> 19:29.952
Well, maybe you shouldn't
drink alone at night.

19:37.860 --> 19:39.026
Done.

19:41.430 --> 19:42.831
To us.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.168
Yeah.

19:47.936 --> 19:49.737
How's everything? How's...
How's work and...

19:50.105 --> 19:51.206
You don't have to make
small talk with me.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.775
Come on. Stop it.
Stop, stop.

19:56.645 --> 19:59.847
Damn it, Em. I just wanted
to make sure you were okay.

20:00.115 --> 20:01.783
Then make me okay.

20:05.620 --> 20:07.689
<i>Damn it.</i>

20:11.826 --> 20:13.960
Fuck me.

20:15.830 --> 20:18.699
Harder.

20:28.009 --> 20:30.343
Oh!

20:45.492 --> 20:47.026
Did it hurt?

20:47.494 --> 20:50.563
I mean, at first when they jab
you with the needle it hurt a lot,

20:50.631 --> 20:53.633
but, I don't know, after a while
you just kind of get used to it.

20:53.867 --> 20:57.247
Kind of like my life.

20:58.038 --> 20:59.805
Did your dad find a new place yet?

21:00.173 --> 21:03.508
Yeah, he's renting this
shitty little apartment.

21:03.543 --> 21:05.510
It's pretty depressing, actually.

21:06.713 --> 21:10.349
- Are he and your mom, like, talking?
- Sometimes, yeah.

21:11.684 --> 21:13.719
The whole thing is just so fucked up.

21:14.020 --> 21:15.454
I bet they freaked
when they saw your tat.

21:15.856 --> 21:17.422
They're way too caught
up in their own bullshit

21:17.690 --> 21:19.791
to pay any attention to me.

21:20.226 --> 21:22.594
I know where we can get some
premium bud for, like, 50 bucks.

21:22.895 --> 21:24.863
- You have 50 bucks?
- Tapped out.

21:24.897 --> 21:27.733
- No shit. You're always tapped out.
- Bite me.

21:30.536 --> 21:32.070
I have an idea.

21:43.883 --> 21:47.218
<i>Holy shit.</i>

21:49.421 --> 21:51.355
It's like a stoner's Toys "R" Us.

22:03.568 --> 22:05.836
All right, guys.
Guys, come on.

22:06.070 --> 22:07.137
Come on!

22:16.781 --> 22:18.816
Doing a little late-night shopping?

22:23.120 --> 22:25.888
You two, head home now.

22:25.923 --> 22:29.125
- Consider this your last warning.
- Is he joking?

22:29.460 --> 22:31.728
You guys, just...
just get out of here.

22:32.095 --> 22:34.197
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Just go!

22:34.432 --> 22:36.299
Hey! Leave the stuff.

22:44.774 --> 22:46.843
So, you wanna be a thief now?

22:52.615 --> 22:54.817
A little piece of advice.

22:57.620 --> 22:59.722
It's harder than you think.

22:59.756 --> 23:04.474
Your first mistake was your numbers.

23:06.963 --> 23:09.431
<i>Every extra person increases
your chances of getting caught</i>

23:09.799 --> 23:12.600
<i>and you had three
people on a one-man job.</i>

23:12.801 --> 23:14.202
It's not a great start.

23:15.637 --> 23:16.972
<i>Come with me.</i>

23:17.940 --> 23:20.641
You see an alarm on the door, window?

23:23.846 --> 23:26.982
Nope?
So how did I get here so fast?

23:28.817 --> 23:31.753
See that little white box up there?

23:31.987 --> 23:33.388
It's a sound sensor.

23:33.822 --> 23:36.724
You break the glass,
that triggers a silent alarm.

23:36.759 --> 23:40.922
10 seconds later,
my office is on the radio, here I am.

23:41.997 --> 23:44.465
<i>Your only option with glass is a cutter.</i>

23:44.700 --> 23:47.334
So this is it, huh? Jackpot.

23:47.668 --> 23:51.872
- How much you got?
- $37.

23:52.040 --> 23:53.340
<i>Wow.</i>

23:55.343 --> 23:58.012
See, the register is also
connected to the alarm.

23:58.346 --> 23:59.713
So you would've been better
to take the whole thing

24:00.015 --> 24:01.848
and open it when you got clear.

24:02.216 --> 24:06.586
Although, if there is any
real cash left overnight...

24:07.855 --> 24:11.858
<i>it's gonna be in the safe,
which is also bolted to the floor.</i>

24:14.395 --> 24:17.764
So unless you know
how to crack a safe...

24:19.733 --> 24:21.301
No?

24:21.701 --> 24:26.105
<i>Well, then there's really nothing
in here worth getting arrested for.</i>

24:28.208 --> 24:29.642
Unless, of course, that was the point.

24:29.676 --> 24:31.911
You think I wanted to get caught?

24:32.212 --> 24:33.712
Self-destruction runs in the family.

24:34.048 --> 24:38.116
A little soon to be making daddy jokes,
don't you think?

24:38.384 --> 24:40.719
You never know until you try.

25:19.157 --> 25:20.724
To your health.

25:24.296 --> 25:26.930
I don't know what you've
been up to, but, uh...

25:28.766 --> 25:32.804
I just had sex with my ex-wife.
Again.

25:33.437 --> 25:35.873
I know, I know, I know.

25:36.273 --> 25:37.865
But you know what? I
know what you're gonna say

25:37.900 --> 25:39.876
and you've never been divorced, so...

25:43.481 --> 25:46.782
Hey, look, I wanted to tell you...

25:49.653 --> 25:52.389
we took care of Hondo.

25:52.423 --> 25:54.991
Oh, man, we made him pay
for what he did to you.

25:56.994 --> 25:58.895
I doubt you'll be running
in the same circles up there

25:59.129 --> 26:02.364
or wherever, but...

26:02.666 --> 26:05.535
if you happen to run
into him, that was us.

26:05.969 --> 26:07.803
I know, I know, you probably
have some Bible verse

26:08.138 --> 26:09.605
about leaving revenge to God,

26:09.973 --> 26:13.242
but, you see, Emmett,
sometimes you cannot wait

26:13.677 --> 26:16.028
for God to put the world
to right because while

26:16.029 --> 26:18.380
you're waiting, the world
just keeps going to shit.

26:20.016 --> 26:23.085
And when you have a guy
like Hood leading the charge,

26:23.119 --> 26:26.498
well, God's just gonna
have to move a lot faster

26:26.503 --> 26:29.023
if He wants to keep up
and you can tell Him I said that.

26:32.194 --> 26:34.274
I miss you.

26:46.008 --> 26:47.575
Cheers.

27:13.567 --> 27:15.000
What are you doing here?

27:15.368 --> 27:17.970
I stopped by to see the kids,
found them here alone,

27:18.371 --> 27:20.005
so I decided to stay and
have dinner with them.

27:20.407 --> 27:22.441
- Where's Deva?
- She went to bed hours ago, Carrie.

27:22.476 --> 27:25.410
- It's past midnight.
- I had to work late.

27:25.444 --> 27:27.679
You know, somehow I don't
think you were at the diner.

27:27.714 --> 27:28.854
Well, you know, a lot of single mothers

27:28.855 --> 27:31.316
- have to work two jobs.
- This has to stop!

27:31.550 --> 27:33.418
Let's not do this.

27:33.886 --> 27:36.054
Isn't the whole point of getting
a divorce so we don't have to fight?

27:36.388 --> 27:37.923
How can you not realize
that you are risking

27:38.224 --> 27:40.191
the well-being of your children?

27:40.593 --> 27:43.060
What is it with you?
Some sort of addiction or something?

27:44.730 --> 27:46.231
You would know.

27:48.700 --> 27:49.967
I'm sorry.

28:06.752 --> 28:08.919
So you and Mom way back when.

28:10.756 --> 28:13.089
- Yeah.
- But not anymore?

28:17.094 --> 28:19.363
- No.
- How come you left her?

28:19.597 --> 28:24.368
I mean, she was pregnant.
She should have found you.

28:24.402 --> 28:26.503
- She should have told you.
- No, no.

28:26.538 --> 28:28.438
It wasn't her fault.

28:28.773 --> 28:31.474
There was no way she
could have got to me

28:31.942 --> 28:35.645
without putting herself,
and you... in a lot of danger.

28:35.946 --> 28:38.548
<i>Then after she met your father,</i>

28:38.816 --> 28:41.184
she did what was best for you.

28:43.453 --> 28:47.335
The point is...
why don't you take it easy on your mom?

28:47.370 --> 28:50.726
- She lied to me my whole life.
- No, she tried to keep you safe.

28:50.760 --> 28:52.861
She left everything. Her whole life.

28:53.129 --> 28:55.665
Gave it all up. Everything.

28:57.701 --> 28:59.368
She did that for you.

29:06.142 --> 29:08.143
When did you know about me?

29:10.146 --> 29:12.047
The first time I saw you.

29:15.051 --> 29:20.131
- You came here for her?
- But I stayed for you.

29:30.333 --> 29:32.500
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, I saw you go to bed...

29:32.535 --> 29:35.069
- Woke up.
- Deva?

29:36.304 --> 29:40.241
- This is not okay.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

29:49.718 --> 29:53.687
- Where'd you find her?
- She was just out with some other kids.

29:54.021 --> 29:56.056
Yeah, well, thanks
for bringing her back.

29:56.358 --> 29:59.760
- Yeah. Have a good night.
- Hood.

30:04.766 --> 30:08.235
You know, Carrie promised
to tell me everything,

30:08.535 --> 30:13.807
but when it came to you...
nothin'.

30:14.075 --> 30:15.208
Whatever your secrets are,

30:15.576 --> 30:18.278
they were worth breaking
a promise to her husband.

30:18.545 --> 30:22.215
<i>You ended my marriage.
Please...</i>

30:23.384 --> 30:26.061
leave me my daughter.

30:28.389 --> 30:31.786
I don't care who made her.
I'm her...

30:35.128 --> 30:37.597
I'm her father.

30:41.902 --> 30:44.103
I'm asking you, please.

31:04.890 --> 31:07.326
This is what we took in last night.

31:07.760 --> 31:10.962
And if you click here, you
can see the same day last week,

31:10.996 --> 31:13.298
last month, and last year.

31:13.466 --> 31:16.634
<i>You click here, you can see
what each girl is bringing in.</i>

31:16.668 --> 31:19.637
- Okay.
- Anyway, I think this is enough for tonight.

31:19.939 --> 31:22.373
Why don't you check on the club?
I'll finish up a few things here.

31:56.307 --> 31:58.508
Proctor had his hands
in Longshadow's pockets.

31:58.809 --> 32:00.810
One thing leads to another.

32:02.013 --> 32:04.681
Now Longshadow is dead.

32:04.982 --> 32:07.484
We'll be coming for you, white girl.

32:07.651 --> 32:11.311
You...
and Proctor.

32:11.655 --> 32:13.656
Soon.

32:55.231 --> 32:58.366
<i>Come on, come on. Let's go!</i>

33:16.217 --> 33:17.418
Who the hell is that?

33:19.254 --> 33:21.021
This is a United States
Marine Corps vehicle.

33:21.222 --> 33:22.857
Step aside...

33:27.062 --> 33:30.431
TOC, kilo-one-niner. Taking
hostile contact on Pondfield 15.

33:30.898 --> 33:32.132
- Requesting...
- We don't have time to wait for backup.

33:32.400 --> 33:33.733
<i>Get us out of here.</i>

33:37.439 --> 33:38.973
Motherfuckers.

33:51.619 --> 33:54.087
<i>Just got a report of shots
being fired on Pondfield Road.</i>

33:54.421 --> 33:56.723
Pondfield Road, that's near Camp Genoa.

33:57.091 --> 33:59.225
- Could be running exercises.
- Not without notifying us.

33:59.593 --> 34:00.994
Siobhan, we're close by.
We're on it.

34:09.936 --> 34:10.902
<i>Jackson, you okay?</i>

34:11.138 --> 34:13.306
Jackson, answer...

34:15.775 --> 34:17.275
<i>Got him.</i>

34:26.452 --> 34:27.820
<i>Come on, let's go!</i>

34:33.126 --> 34:34.458
<i>Move it, move it!</i>

34:55.813 --> 34:59.050
Alma, we need backup!
EMS, we got multiple casualties!

34:59.317 --> 35:01.152
Repeat, multiple casualties!

35:15.300 --> 35:17.834
Are you worried about the Indian?

35:19.671 --> 35:22.606
He knew.
How could he know?

35:23.007 --> 35:24.608
They would naturally
suspect my involvement.

35:25.009 --> 35:26.810
Who pulled the trigger
is not important to them.

35:27.178 --> 35:29.379
It seemed pretty important to him.

35:29.681 --> 35:32.515
You know, I'm gonna put
a guard in the house.

35:32.850 --> 35:35.052
Anywhere you go,
Burton will go with you.

35:35.386 --> 35:37.820
That Indian won't get near you again.

35:49.400 --> 35:51.033
- Morning, Sheriff.
- Morning.

35:51.402 --> 35:53.303
- How can I help you, sir?
- Who's the CO here?

35:53.537 --> 35:54.537
Colonel Stowe, sir.

35:56.707 --> 35:59.328
Okay, well, I need to see him.

36:02.879 --> 36:04.714
You have an appointment
to see the colonel?

36:04.748 --> 36:07.149
You just told me his name.
How could I have an appointment?

36:07.550 --> 36:08.951
<i>No one gets
on base without authorization.</i>

36:09.385 --> 36:11.520
There were four Marines killed
on the road earlier today,

36:11.554 --> 36:13.409
about eight miles from here.

36:13.444 --> 36:14.656
- I'm sure you heard about it.
- Yes, sir.

36:14.924 --> 36:19.707
Well, this is a homicide investigation.
That's my authorization.

36:22.064 --> 36:24.566
<i>- Sheriff Hood.
- Colonel Stowe.</i>

36:32.441 --> 36:34.075
I've been expecting you.

36:34.409 --> 36:35.476
Not according to your men at the gate.

36:35.778 --> 36:39.313
They were just following protocol.
This way.

36:41.951 --> 36:43.317
Hey, Colonel.

36:44.919 --> 36:46.787
Let me just start by
saying how sorry I am.

36:47.256 --> 36:50.124
- It's a tragedy.
- Nine tours in Iraq and Afghanistan between 'em,

36:50.592 --> 36:54.128
and they get killed demilling an
antiquated base in Banshee, Pennsylvania.

36:54.596 --> 36:57.456
I have no idea how I'm gonna talk
their families through that one.

37:03.138 --> 37:05.773
Colonel Douglas Stowe.

37:10.978 --> 37:12.812
So you're shutting the place down?

37:12.846 --> 37:14.714
We're basically clearing
house for all the contraband

37:14.982 --> 37:16.215
that gets shipped out of the war zones.

37:16.249 --> 37:19.152
Guns, valuables, drugs, you name it.

37:20.788 --> 37:22.121
And cash.

37:26.326 --> 37:28.627
Your tax dollars at
work. Whether we're buying

37:28.628 --> 37:30.977
guns off the streets to
keep them from the Taliban

37:31.042 --> 37:35.668
or sending out soldiers with briefcases
full of money to pay off informants.

37:35.702 --> 37:39.037
We've got half of Afghanistan
on the damn payroll.

37:39.072 --> 37:41.006
<i>The money we don't use
has to be inventoried</i>

37:41.340 --> 37:43.208
<i>and sent back to the Fed to
be wasted in the next war.</i>

37:46.378 --> 37:51.382
- Right. You don't agree?
- I don't like war.

37:51.684 --> 37:55.553
But when you ask me to fight,
let me fight.

38:01.293 --> 38:06.497
So the four Marines who were killed,
they were transporting cash?

38:06.532 --> 38:11.135
No, we don't move cash in trucks.
We contract armored vehicles for that.

38:11.503 --> 38:14.438
Those were mostly
confiscated automatic weapons.

38:14.840 --> 38:17.842
AKs and M4s headed to a Fed
facility to be destroyed.

38:18.176 --> 38:20.865
Great, so now the Redbones
are armed like the Taliban.

38:20.900 --> 38:23.413
- I'm sorry, the Redbones?
- Yeah. The guys who jacked your truck.

38:23.448 --> 38:26.183
They're a tribal gang
from the reservation.

38:26.551 --> 38:28.518
Do you have a list of everything
that was in those crates?

38:28.854 --> 38:31.380
- I do.
- Great, well, if you could just have one

38:31.415 --> 38:32.522
of your people
print that out for me, then...

38:32.857 --> 38:35.559
Sheriff Hood, I appreciate
the visit and the fact that

38:35.560 --> 38:38.262
you and your deputies tried
your best to stop these people.

38:38.730 --> 38:41.048
But the moment they
killed my Marines and stole

38:41.049 --> 38:43.367
government property, this
became a matter for the military.

38:43.701 --> 38:47.170
NCIS will lead the investigation
with the FBI and the BIA.

38:47.204 --> 38:49.539
Now, that's a lot of fuckin'
letters, and the last thing

38:49.540 --> 38:52.235
you want is be getting
caught up in the middle of it.

38:56.046 --> 38:58.714
That's true, but those guns may
end up on the streets of my town.

38:59.049 --> 39:01.251
And if they do,
you feel free to shoot back.

39:01.551 --> 39:03.018
We got four dead Marines here.

39:03.420 --> 39:05.382
No one's gonna have the patience for

39:05.383 --> 39:08.326
a small-town sheriff who
thinks he knows better.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.102
Okay.

39:20.136 --> 39:22.737
- Thanks for your time.
- Captain Murphy here will show you out.

39:23.907 --> 39:25.774
Thanks again for coming by.

39:31.080 --> 39:34.370
You don't look like
a Marine, Captain Murphy.

39:52.600 --> 39:53.801
<i>Sugar here.</i>

39:53.836 --> 39:56.170
You know that one big job
we've been looking for?

39:56.438 --> 39:57.705
<i>Well, I think I found it.</i>

39:58.106 --> 40:01.843
- Do tell.
- The Marine base, Camp Genoa.

40:01.877 --> 40:04.045
<i>They're moving cash by the truckload.</i>

40:04.446 --> 40:06.314
<i>- Millions of dollars.
- If they're moving</i>

40:06.614 --> 40:08.216
that kind of money,
they're still gonna have

40:08.250 --> 40:10.517
<i>military grade security systems.</i>

40:10.819 --> 40:13.119
Yeah, if only we knew someone

40:13.455 --> 40:15.956
who could hack into
the military network.

40:17.992 --> 40:19.860
<i>It's been 25 minutes.</i>

40:19.894 --> 40:22.596
<i>You should be in by now.</i>

40:22.630 --> 40:26.466
You try working with a motherfuckin'
hand cannon in your face.

40:30.972 --> 40:33.907
This here is the New
York Stock Exchange.

40:34.141 --> 40:35.408
There's a lot of moving parts.

40:35.809 --> 40:37.710
Well, then, make them
move a little bit faster.

40:37.979 --> 40:39.880
The trick ain't gettin' in.

40:40.314 --> 40:42.849
The trick is gettin' out without
anyone knowing you've been there.

40:42.883 --> 40:44.821
That's of no concern to me.

40:44.852 --> 40:47.953
- There.
- That's it? You're in?

40:48.188 --> 40:51.482
- Oh, no, that's just the signal.
- Signal? What signal?

41:03.303 --> 41:06.571
- Damn it, he got the fuckin' money!
- Go get him.

41:09.009 --> 41:11.176
- Have you seen me run?
- Bullshit!

41:50.011 --> 41:52.490
<i>- Huh!
- Shit!</i>

42:02.494 --> 42:04.061
Bollocks.

42:26.450 --> 42:27.817
Fuck me!

42:38.462 --> 42:40.429
Now is not really a good time.

42:40.763 --> 42:43.432
Everything okay?
How'd the Fat Al thing go?

42:43.467 --> 42:45.968
Up in fuckin' smoke.

42:46.003 --> 42:49.005
You know, I'm actually
starting to believe in God?

42:49.306 --> 42:51.707
And I'm thinkin' that
motherfucker hates me.

42:52.142 --> 42:55.210
Yeah, well, I got
something might cheer you up.

42:55.444 --> 42:58.324
I highly doubt that.

42:58.359 --> 43:02.283
- What the fuck, Job?
- Hold on.

43:02.318 --> 43:06.354
- Is this all the money?
- Motherfucker sat on his own grenade!

43:06.389 --> 43:08.289
Damn.

43:10.426 --> 43:12.394
I ain't coming back to Pennsylvania.

43:12.828 --> 43:16.964
I just had eyes on eight
to 10 million in unwashed U.S. dollars.

43:25.641 --> 43:27.174
I hate you.

43:27.475 --> 43:30.144
You know that?
I fuckin' hate you.

43:33.348 --> 43:37.051
- I see you met the "Duck Dynasty" guys.
- Yeah.

43:37.085 --> 43:39.687
Don't worry, I'll sanitize
the booth when they leave.

43:42.223 --> 43:44.158
Here you go.

43:45.493 --> 43:47.227
What can I get you guys to eat?

43:47.529 --> 43:49.496
How about a deluxe burger
and your phone number?

43:51.332 --> 43:53.700
- I don't have a phone.
- That's all right.

43:53.734 --> 43:55.269
We don't have to talk.

43:55.303 --> 43:57.538
You're gonna want to move that hand.

44:02.677 --> 44:04.911
<i>- How's that?
- Yeah.</i>

44:05.212 --> 44:07.213
- Does that feel good?
- Sure does.

44:07.347 --> 44:08.347
Yeah?

44:09.850 --> 44:12.218
- Hope it was worth it.
- Worth what?

44:17.657 --> 44:19.874
How do you want that burger cooked?

44:23.230 --> 44:26.865
Hi.
So what happened?

44:27.201 --> 44:29.724
- He grabbed my ass.
- So you broke his nose?

44:29.766 --> 44:31.471
Do you really think you're the
right person to be lecturing me?

44:31.871 --> 44:34.406
Yeah, 'cause right now I'm
the only friend you've got.

44:37.043 --> 44:41.113
So I'll ask you one more time.
What's going on with you?

44:42.716 --> 44:44.416
I'm a fucking waitress.

44:46.886 --> 44:48.754
I'm getting divorced
and my kids look at me

44:49.055 --> 44:51.055
like they don't know me anymore.

44:51.390 --> 44:55.627
And I'm getting groped by inbred freaks.
Fucking look at me.

45:04.837 --> 45:08.072
Go home.
I'll clean this up.

45:11.243 --> 45:15.079
- So this is the one, huh?
- Yeah.

45:16.949 --> 45:20.451
I don't know.
A military base.

45:20.485 --> 45:25.623
- Sounds risky.
- Anything worthwhile usually is.

45:25.923 --> 45:29.260
- And it's being decommissioned.
- What about Job?

45:30.428 --> 45:31.862
He said he'd think about it.

45:31.896 --> 45:35.166
<i>I don't think he's coming back here.</i>

45:35.433 --> 45:39.435
Look at you, Sugar,
already trying to cut me out.

45:41.039 --> 45:43.707
Is that your driving outfit?

45:43.741 --> 45:45.341
Yes, it is.

45:45.777 --> 45:49.345
And fortunately it's also my
"don't take any shit" outfit.

45:49.380 --> 45:51.114
So whatever it is you
thinking about sayin',

45:51.448 --> 45:53.892
swallow it and pour
me a fuckin' whiskey.

45:56.180 --> 45:58.137
If I start drinkin' now,

45:58.172 --> 46:01.965
maybe I'll be drunk enough to
handle this town in daylight.

46:04.662 --> 46:06.629
<i>Gentlemen...</i>

46:09.800 --> 46:10.966
Camp Genoa.

46:11.168 --> 46:13.368
Camp Genoa.

46:17.174 --> 46:20.943
You know, my whole way over here,
I just kept thinking,

46:21.311 --> 46:23.979
"I can't believe
I'm coming back to this shithole

46:24.314 --> 46:26.015
to mix it up with the fuckin' Marines."

46:26.316 --> 46:30.219
Well, it's not the
Marines I'm worried about.

46:30.520 --> 46:32.221
- It's the mercs.
- The mercs?

46:32.255 --> 46:34.389
You didn't say nothing
about no motherfuck...

46:34.424 --> 46:38.393
- What kind of mercs?!
- Well, the bad kind.

46:38.428 --> 46:41.396
I'd say ex-Navy SEALs if I had to guess.

46:41.664 --> 46:45.934
I don't believe this shit.
What is it with you?

46:46.202 --> 46:47.902
Is it a death wish?
Is that what it is?

46:48.170 --> 46:53.574
Because if it is, why don't you
go out and get yourself killed?!

46:53.876 --> 46:55.576
Why do you always want
to get me killed with you?!

46:55.611 --> 46:58.579
- It's a lot of money.
- It's fucking soldiers with guns.

46:58.614 --> 47:01.380
Big fucking guns.
We ain't talking about rent-a-cops.

47:01.383 --> 47:03.851
We ain't even talkin' about real cops.

47:04.185 --> 47:05.886
We talkin' about fuckin' commandos.

47:06.221 --> 47:08.187
- They'll never see us com...
- Uh-uh, nope!

47:23.203 --> 47:24.703
Tell me about the money.
