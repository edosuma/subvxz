WEBVTT

00:01.034 --> 00:02.672
Next, on Airwolf.

00:04.771 --> 00:06.512
Somebody's entered the lair.

00:06.573 --> 00:07.677
They found Airwolf?

00:07.741 --> 00:10.278
Finding that helicopter
means a great deal to me.

00:10.344 --> 00:12.381
You might say it's a
matter of life or death.

00:12.446 --> 00:13.857
Look out!

00:15.215 --> 00:17.286
John Bradford Horn.

00:17.351 --> 00:20.059
I always thought he'd make
another try for Airwolf.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.891
There's no smell of gas on
the rocks. There's nothing.

00:22.956 --> 00:25.436
The helicopter was here, I'm positive.

00:25.492 --> 00:27.665
I have to find a new home for the Lady.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.074

02:00.354 --> 02:03.892
For crying out loud, this
is no way to treat a lady.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.460
You see, she's starting to act up.

02:06.526 --> 02:09.564
You should have told Archangel to forget it.

02:15.602 --> 02:16.979
What's your location?

02:17.037 --> 02:20.484
About 500 miles west of the
Virgin Islands, 1,000 feet.

02:20.540 --> 02:23.487
Make this quick, Michael, we're
getting the hell knocked out of us.

02:23.543 --> 02:26.990
Okay, insert that special
laser disc I gave you.

02:28.181 --> 02:29.353
You got it.

02:29.416 --> 02:32.158
Now baby, let's show ‘em how it's done.

02:39.960 --> 02:42.941
Okay Michael, all systems are go here.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.374
Telemetry should be starting now.

02:45.599 --> 02:47.704
Roger, Dominic.

02:48.902 --> 02:50.438
How much longer Michael?

02:50.504 --> 02:52.575
Hang on almost finished.

03:04.885 --> 03:07.126
Easy baby. Just a little more.

03:15.662 --> 03:17.335
We lost him.

03:17.397 --> 03:19.308
It's okay, we got enough.

03:44.624 --> 03:46.433
Keys are dead ahead. We cleared the storm.

03:46.493 --> 03:47.995
Hallelujah!

04:14.855 --> 04:17.733
Well, a mission like that makes
this valley look mighty pretty.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.065
It's good to be home.

04:19.125 --> 04:21.504
Let's put the Lady to bed.

04:45.418 --> 04:47.398
So what kind of damage we got on the Lady?

04:47.454 --> 04:49.161
We popped a few rivets,

04:49.222 --> 04:51.566
shook lose some components
and some lateral scanners,

04:51.625 --> 04:54.003
nothing fatal. Not this time.

04:54.060 --> 04:57.371
Now, how about that cold
one you promised me?

05:23.123 --> 05:24.864
How much further is it?

05:24.925 --> 05:27.769
Not far, another coupla minutes.

05:27.828 --> 05:31.503
Good. I know your boss likes
to keep his meetings private,

05:32.165 --> 05:34.771
but this is the far side of nowhere.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.008
Has he got a problem, Quist? Should he?

05:37.070 --> 05:40.313
Well, it took longer to put this
deal together then I told him.

05:40.373 --> 05:42.649
We're very close, maybe a couple of days.

05:42.709 --> 05:45.485
Maybe you should talk to him about that.

05:46.279 --> 05:48.987
Honey, relax, he's just doing his job.

05:51.117 --> 05:53.529
Exactly, I'm just doing my job.

05:57.057 --> 06:00.527
Eddie, this is far enough.
Could you pull it over please?

06:13.340 --> 06:15.786
Well, this is where we get out.

06:16.776 --> 06:18.585
I think we'd better wait,
I don't think he's here yet.

06:18.645 --> 06:20.750
He'll show himself after he sees you.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.452
Now, get out.

06:22.649 --> 06:23.889
Now.

06:40.367 --> 06:42.074
Run, Grace, run!

06:55.081 --> 06:56.458
Come on.

07:18.071 --> 07:20.051
She couldn't have got too far.

07:20.106 --> 07:21.517
Come on.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.704
Come on, we'd better get outta here.

08:28.241 --> 08:31.188
No sign of a malfunction.
Must be the real thing.

08:31.244 --> 08:32.722
What real thing? What is it?

08:32.779 --> 08:35.054
Somebody's entered the lair.

09:11.551 --> 09:14.361
Everything looks okay, nothing disturbed.

09:14.687 --> 09:16.325
Hey Dom, look!

09:18.958 --> 09:20.198
Oh my God!

09:20.260 --> 09:21.739
She's got a bullet wound.

09:22.695 --> 09:24.936
I'll get on the horn, get some help.

09:34.140 --> 09:35.585
Hello?

09:36.142 --> 09:37.883
One moment please.

09:38.078 --> 09:41.355
There, that should keep
you occupied for a while.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.724
Call for you sir, Mr. Quist.

09:51.157 --> 09:52.568
Check.

09:55.695 --> 09:57.072
All right Quist, what is it?

09:57.130 --> 10:00.543
Yes Mr. Horn, it's about that little
problem you had with Billings.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.238
That should have been settled by now.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.804
Yes sir, he's history.

10:03.870 --> 10:06.976
When you ask me to handle
something sir, it gets done.

10:07.040 --> 10:10.453
We had a slight problem
with his girlfriend, sir.

10:10.510 --> 10:13.957
What happened, Quist?
And please don't snow me.

10:14.514 --> 10:16.016
No sir, I wouldn't do that.

10:16.082 --> 10:18.688
Mr. Horn, it was like this.
Billings put up a fight.

10:18.751 --> 10:21.322
I took care of him but his girlfriend ran.

10:21.387 --> 10:22.525
Now, I hit her once

10:22.589 --> 10:25.536
but some people showed up just
before I could find her body.

10:25.592 --> 10:27.594
Are you saying that she's escaped?

10:27.660 --> 10:30.140
No sir. No sir. That'd be a 1,000-to-1 shot.

10:30.196 --> 10:33.302
She was alone out there in the desert,
she was bleeding all over the place.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.471
She's lying out there dead
sir, I'm sure of it.

10:35.535 --> 10:37.139
Well, I'm not.

10:37.504 --> 10:39.381
Now listen, Quist.

10:39.706 --> 10:42.186
No one in my operations make mistakes.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.779
Billings already found that out.

10:44.844 --> 10:46.619
I understand, sir.

10:47.013 --> 10:49.118
I want you to pick me up at 4:30,

10:49.182 --> 10:51.594
and I'll be expecting good news.

10:51.918 --> 10:53.829
You can depend on me.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.265
Mate.

11:43.937 --> 11:45.575
Is she going to be all right?

11:45.638 --> 11:47.345
It looks like it.

12:10.830 --> 12:12.275
Thank you.

12:13.833 --> 12:16.746
I understand you're Miss Grace Harrison.

12:17.704 --> 12:19.911
Michael Goldsmith-Briggs.

12:21.574 --> 12:25.454
Miss Harrison, you were found
in a classified installation.

12:25.778 --> 12:28.884
I'd like to ask you a
few questions about that.

12:28.948 --> 12:30.052
You a cop?

12:30.116 --> 12:32.027
No, I work for the government.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.792
- Oh, the FBI?
- No.

12:34.153 --> 12:37.691
Nah, I didn't think so. They
don't dress snazzy like you.

12:40.593 --> 12:43.005
Did you get that working for the government?

12:43.062 --> 12:44.905
Yes, a couple of years ago.

12:44.964 --> 12:46.705
And they're still making you work?

12:46.766 --> 12:48.268
You shoulda got a pension.

12:48.334 --> 12:50.610
You could sue. You know
my first cousin's a lawyer.

12:50.670 --> 12:52.274
Yes, well…

12:52.372 --> 12:55.546
Miss Harrison, if we could, I'd
like to get back to business.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.521
Do you feel up to
answering a few questions?

12:58.578 --> 13:02.583
Yeah, I guess so, but
don't make it too hard on me,

13:02.649 --> 13:06.256
my head still feels like someone
used it for hockey practice.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.128
I'll keep it simple.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.329
Is Grace Harrison your full name?

13:11.924 --> 13:13.198
Do I have to answer that?

13:13.259 --> 13:15.000
I'd appreciate it.

13:16.229 --> 13:18.505
Yeah, okay, but don't laugh.

13:19.666 --> 13:22.738
My real name is Alma Grace Harrison.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.344
But I never use it.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.748
Alma, it sounds like
I should be making quilts

13:26.806 --> 13:29.412
or worked in a library or something.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.319
What were you doing in the desert alone?

13:32.378 --> 13:35.848
Oh, well, I was take’n pictures.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.024
You know, like with a camera.

13:40.086 --> 13:43.124
I mean, sometimes I just get these
urges to go out in the desert

13:43.189 --> 13:44.930
and take pictures.

13:44.991 --> 13:47.494
Kind of a junior Ansel Adams, hmm?

13:48.761 --> 13:50.331
If you say so.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.868
What kind of a camera do you use?

13:53.933 --> 13:55.970
Now, I'm not real good with names.

13:56.035 --> 13:59.346
It was Japanese though,
I think, they called it…

14:00.139 --> 14:01.447
Tokyo.

14:01.507 --> 14:03.783
I see. How did you get hurt?

14:04.877 --> 14:08.154
Well, it was like this, I was
out there take’n pictures

14:08.214 --> 14:10.694
and, all of a sudden,
I hear all these engines,

14:10.750 --> 14:12.991
and it's a motorcycle gang.

14:13.953 --> 14:16.763
Now, I don't want to brag,
but a woman who looks like me

14:16.823 --> 14:19.429
shouldn't meet a motorcycle gang
out in the middle of the desert,

14:19.492 --> 14:21.335
if you know what I mean.

14:21.394 --> 14:23.840
- Absolutely.
- Anyway…

14:24.797 --> 14:26.902
they had these guns and they were
shoot’n ‘em all over the place.

14:26.966 --> 14:28.843
So, I hid behind these rocks,

14:28.901 --> 14:32.178
and one of the bullets must
have bounced off a boulder

14:32.238 --> 14:35.082
or something, because it hit me.

14:35.475 --> 14:38.581
Did you cry out, let
them know you were there?

14:38.678 --> 14:40.089
Are you kid’n?

14:40.146 --> 14:42.558
I stayed hidden until they left.

14:42.615 --> 14:45.528
Then I was just wander’n around and

14:45.585 --> 14:48.191
I found that cave and the helicopter.

14:48.254 --> 14:50.029
It's a hot look’n machine.

14:50.089 --> 14:53.559
I remember think’n that
it must have a radio inside,

14:53.626 --> 14:54.900
but I must have blacked out or someth’n

14:54.961 --> 14:57.407
before I figured out
how to open up the door,

14:57.463 --> 15:00.603
and the next thing I
remember, I woke up here.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.039
Why didn't you use your vehicle?
You must have driven to that area.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.582
Oh, yeah, my car.

15:09.142 --> 15:11.452
Well, I forgot to tell you that part.

15:11.511 --> 15:13.855
The motorcycle gang stole it.

15:14.380 --> 15:15.620
I see.

15:16.082 --> 15:18.494
Thank you Grace, that
will be enough for now.

15:18.551 --> 15:20.758
Why don't you get some rest?

15:30.630 --> 15:32.007
Quite a performance, eh?

15:32.064 --> 15:34.010
Yeah, I thought I was a bad liar.

15:34.066 --> 15:35.636
What do you think she's up to?

15:35.701 --> 15:36.702
I'm not sure.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.579
But, she's certainly not
my idea of some super spy

15:39.639 --> 15:42.210
who tracked down Airwolf on purpose.

15:43.342 --> 15:45.686
There's no argument about that.

15:46.179 --> 15:48.989
What puzzles me is that gunshot wound.

15:50.116 --> 15:52.960
Why would anybody want to
hurt a gal like that?

15:53.019 --> 15:56.523
Well, I could turn up the heat
on her, demolish her story,

15:56.589 --> 15:57.829
maybe break her down, but…

15:57.890 --> 16:01.360
No, Michael. She's already so
frightened of whoever shot her.

16:01.427 --> 16:03.464
Cate's right about that.

16:04.130 --> 16:07.077
If we scared her, she'd just clam up more.

16:09.569 --> 16:12.880
Gotta find some way to get
her to tell the truth

16:13.873 --> 16:16.479
without her knowing she's tell’n it.

16:18.611 --> 16:19.783
Hi.

16:20.413 --> 16:23.189
We cleaned your slacks and
replaced the sweater and jacket.

16:23.249 --> 16:24.819
I'll just hang ‘em here.

16:24.884 --> 16:26.591
Oh, thanks a lot.

16:29.388 --> 16:31.994
- Think I'm gonna take a nap.
- Okay.

17:34.487 --> 17:36.160
You head’n into town?

17:36.222 --> 17:37.997
Yeah, hop in.

17:48.634 --> 17:50.636
So, I told him to keep his hands off me,

17:50.703 --> 17:53.513
and he dumped me by the side of the road.

17:54.273 --> 17:55.479
Creep.

17:56.842 --> 17:59.083
For some reason, I seem to attract ‘em.

17:59.145 --> 18:02.183
Other girls draw millionaires,
I get the weirdos.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.990
Come on, a nice look’n lady like you?

18:05.051 --> 18:06.997
Ought to have your pick of men.

18:07.053 --> 18:09.226
Yeah, tell me about it.

18:10.389 --> 18:13.700
The trouble is, I'm a
sucker for a good story.

18:14.393 --> 18:17.499
I mean, these guys can
see me come’n a mile away.

18:17.563 --> 18:20.840
And they've always got
these sad puppy dog eyes.

18:25.705 --> 18:29.744
Next thing you know, I'm do’n their
laundry and support’n the 2 of us.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.288
Well Grace,

18:31.777 --> 18:34.553
you ought to know how to change that.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.184
Yeah, sure.

18:37.216 --> 18:39.287
But, the way I figure it,

18:39.719 --> 18:42.962
sooner or later, there will be a Mr. Right.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.671
No luck, sir.

18:58.004 --> 19:00.780
She hasn't been in her room and her
car's not in the parking garage.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.047
We've got a problem, Quist.

19:08.180 --> 19:10.854
There she is. Right there in that car.

19:11.884 --> 19:14.490
Well, well, Stringfellow Hawke.

19:14.587 --> 19:16.157
Stringfellow who?

19:16.222 --> 19:17.701
Never mind.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.825
Let's see what they do.

19:20.726 --> 19:23.172
Well, thanks a lot for the ride.

19:23.462 --> 19:25.635
Sure I can't see you again?

19:25.698 --> 19:28.304
Well gee, any other time, but…

19:28.401 --> 19:30.972
I gotta go out of town for a while.

19:31.771 --> 19:33.045
Why did she come back?

19:33.105 --> 19:34.641
She knows we're following her.

19:34.707 --> 19:36.653
She's kind of a dim bulb.

19:36.842 --> 19:40.619
Well, be that as it may, she
wouldn't come back here to stay.

19:44.216 --> 19:46.958
Tell Eddie to drive into the garage.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.396
Eddie.

20:30.362 --> 20:31.500
What?

20:31.564 --> 20:32.770
I'm sorry, sir.

20:32.832 --> 20:34.140
She's not in her room.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.840
And her key is still in the box.

20:38.404 --> 20:40.145
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

20:58.457 --> 21:01.734
I know it sounds crazy, but
that's really what happened.

21:01.794 --> 21:03.501
See, they caught me there

21:03.562 --> 21:07.066
and this government man was
giving me the 3rd degree.

21:07.133 --> 21:09.511
Well, I didn't say noth’n
about you, Mr. Horn.

21:10.002 --> 21:11.811
I just sandbagged and gave ‘em the slip.

21:11.871 --> 21:15.751
And I was on my way out of town
when you and Mr. Quist, well…

21:15.808 --> 21:18.721
I know this doesn't make a lot of sense.

21:18.844 --> 21:22.189
Oh, that's all right, Grace.
I'm sure it's the truth.

21:22.248 --> 21:25.525
Would you like something to settle
your nerves? A drink perhaps?

21:25.584 --> 21:28.758
Thanks Mr. Horn, I'd love a Scotch and milk.

21:29.188 --> 21:32.362
With a couple of teaspoons
of sugar stirred in.

21:34.693 --> 21:36.832
You heard the lady, Quist.

21:39.431 --> 21:40.774
Grace,

21:43.035 --> 21:46.573
have you any idea what
you've stumbled onto here?

21:47.139 --> 21:49.642
No, I guess I don't, Mr. Horn.

21:49.708 --> 21:52.712
Do you think you could
find that cave again?

21:52.778 --> 21:55.588
Oh, I don't know. I don't have a
real good sense of direction.

21:55.648 --> 21:58.925
My Dad used to say I could
get lost in a closet.

21:59.718 --> 22:03.632
Suppose I had Quist help you,
take you back to that same area.

22:04.089 --> 22:05.830
Well, I could try.

22:06.425 --> 22:09.872
You'll have to do a lot
better than that, Grace.

22:10.362 --> 22:13.605
Finding that helicopter
means a great deal to me.

22:14.300 --> 22:17.509
You might say it's a
matter of life or death.

22:34.687 --> 22:37.463
I wasn't 30 seconds
behind her at that hotel.

22:37.523 --> 22:39.332
She just disappeared.

22:39.391 --> 22:41.064
You think she could have
made you as a plant?

22:41.126 --> 22:43.936
Oh, come on Michael, she couldn't
make a philodendron as a plant.

22:43.996 --> 22:45.805
Grace is no spy.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.243
Whether she fooled us or not,
the bottom line is,

22:48.300 --> 22:51.110
she's gone and she's out of our control.

22:51.403 --> 22:54.850
I say we better start make’n
some plans of our own.

22:55.374 --> 22:59.049
Yeah, I think it's time we
pulled off our little surprise.

23:16.595 --> 23:18.097
This is it?

23:18.163 --> 23:19.904
It sure looks like it.

23:19.965 --> 23:22.104
Yeah, I'm almost positive.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.575
Ladies first.

23:55.834 --> 23:57.871
Okay, Grace, where is it?

23:58.337 --> 24:00.715
I don't know. It was here.

24:04.410 --> 24:06.321
You're sure this is the right place?

24:06.378 --> 24:08.255
Well, it's got to be.

24:09.615 --> 24:13.119
See, that's where they get
the helicopter in and out.

24:14.053 --> 24:15.555
Looks awfully narrow to me.

24:15.621 --> 24:16.964
There's no oil spots on the ground,

24:17.022 --> 24:19.024
there's no smell of gas
on the rocks. There's noth’n.

24:19.091 --> 24:20.900
Do you think the man is her boss?

24:20.960 --> 24:22.030
We'll see.

24:22.094 --> 24:25.234
If he is, I'll have an
assault team all over them.

24:25.297 --> 24:27.868
The helicopter was here. I'm positive.

24:28.434 --> 24:30.471
I'm not sure what your game is Grace,

24:30.536 --> 24:33.949
but I'm not going back to the
boss with another problem.

24:34.006 --> 24:37.453
He said if you fail, I should
carry out my contract.

24:37.576 --> 24:39.112
Quist, please.

24:41.046 --> 24:43.856
Okay Grace, I'm gonna help you out.

24:44.383 --> 24:47.956
We'll go back and we'll
talk to Mr. John Horn.

24:48.020 --> 24:50.125
I'll take the heat for ya.

24:50.856 --> 24:52.392
Thanks, Quist.

24:53.359 --> 24:55.339
Let's get outta here.

24:58.597 --> 25:01.305
I have to find a new home for the Lady.

25:01.967 --> 25:03.969
John Bradford Horn.

25:04.770 --> 25:07.580
Boy, if we could get our hands on him.

25:07.906 --> 25:09.943
Do you think he's still in this area?

25:10.009 --> 25:12.615
Who knows? The last report I had
said he was out of the country,

25:12.678 --> 25:14.783
doing business here by telephone.

25:14.847 --> 25:17.225
I always thought he'd try
again to grab Airwolf.

25:17.282 --> 25:19.489
It's the key to the one thing he hasn't got.

25:19.551 --> 25:23.727
Right, a place where he can
live without fear of expulsion.

25:25.157 --> 25:27.535
With Airwolf, he'd take over
some little island country,

25:27.593 --> 25:29.766
and then set up his own government.

25:29.828 --> 25:32.035
Not while I'm walk’n around, Michael.

25:35.601 --> 25:37.547
When we got there,
everything had been cleaned out.

25:37.603 --> 25:40.379
No helicopter, no bench, no tool, nothing.

25:40.439 --> 25:42.646
Well, that's disappointing.

25:42.808 --> 25:45.948
Well, I'm awful sorry,
Mr. Horn. I did my best.

25:46.945 --> 25:49.118
Obviously, they became suspicious of you

25:49.181 --> 25:52.060
when you disappeared from your hotel room.

25:52.718 --> 25:56.188
So, they relocated Airwolf just to be safe.

25:56.855 --> 26:00.598
Well Grace, you'll just have to
make contact with them again.

26:00.659 --> 26:01.831
Me?

26:01.894 --> 26:05.307
Well, I lied to ‘em, they'll never
believe me. They'll arrest me.

26:05.364 --> 26:07.776
Of course, if you'd rather not risk it.

26:07.833 --> 26:10.643
Well, to tell you the truth, Mr. Horn…

26:13.038 --> 26:15.279
But if you don't,

26:15.340 --> 26:17.718
you will no longer be of any use to me.

26:17.776 --> 26:19.585
And you remember what happened to Billings

26:19.645 --> 26:22.455
when he was no longer of any use to me?

26:26.852 --> 26:29.059
Anything you say, Mr. Horn.

26:30.289 --> 26:31.495
Good.

26:32.624 --> 26:34.103
Now, the first thing we have to do

26:34.159 --> 26:37.072
is let them think they caught up with you

26:37.963 --> 26:39.533
on their own.

26:51.910 --> 26:54.117
That's it, 2 more leg lifts.

26:54.179 --> 26:55.214
Like this?

26:55.280 --> 26:58.352
Yeah. Nice and slow
till your injury heals.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.787
One more. Couple more.

27:02.588 --> 27:04.067
Keep go’n.

27:05.657 --> 27:07.728
There you go, keep go’n.

27:08.494 --> 27:09.973
3 more.

27:10.229 --> 27:12.436
That's it. There you go.

27:13.398 --> 27:14.741
Grace, look out!

27:16.902 --> 27:18.245
Grace!

27:31.016 --> 27:32.586
Are you okay?

28:23.635 --> 28:25.376
She popped a couple of stitches,

28:25.437 --> 28:27.212
but surgical tape should hold it.

28:27.272 --> 28:30.082
- Otherwise, she's fine.
- Thank you, Doctor.

28:31.109 --> 28:33.487
Now, Miss Harrison,

28:33.545 --> 28:37.118
my colleagues and I know that
you're in deep trouble.

28:38.116 --> 28:42.758
We also know that your
previous story is a fairytale.

28:42.821 --> 28:44.095
You must think I'm really terrible

28:44.156 --> 28:47.194
lying to the government and everything,

28:47.259 --> 28:49.432
but I was just so scared.

28:49.995 --> 28:53.101
See, there's this man
named John Bradford Horn…

28:53.165 --> 28:54.735
Excuse me.

28:54.967 --> 28:57.004
Michael, shouldn't Hawke be here for this?

28:57.069 --> 28:58.878
He's busy outside.

28:59.304 --> 29:01.875
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. Go ahead.

29:01.940 --> 29:05.319
Please, Miss Harrison, continue.

29:06.111 --> 29:09.752
Well, Tom Billings, the man they
found murdered in the desert,

29:09.815 --> 29:11.522
was my boyfriend.

29:11.883 --> 29:13.556
He tried to double-cross Horn,

29:13.619 --> 29:16.395
and Horn sent his hitmen out to
try to kill us, and I got away,

29:16.455 --> 29:18.935
and I just stumbled into that cave.

29:18.991 --> 29:20.971
Why didn't you tell us this before?

29:21.026 --> 29:22.903
Why did you run away?

29:23.262 --> 29:25.742
Well, when I saw that helicopter,

29:25.797 --> 29:28.607
I knew that it had to be something special.

29:28.667 --> 29:31.739
And I thought I could make a deal with Horn.

29:31.803 --> 29:35.945
But Horn didn't believe me, he
thought I was trying to trick him.

29:36.308 --> 29:38.151
You gotta help me,

29:38.443 --> 29:39.820
or I'm dead.

29:39.878 --> 29:42.290
There's only one way
you're going to be safe,

29:42.347 --> 29:46.124
and that is for you to help us capture Horn.

29:46.785 --> 29:47.923
Me?

29:48.587 --> 29:49.964
Well, how?

29:50.022 --> 29:52.195
Tell us everything you know about him.

29:52.257 --> 29:55.204
Have you seen him? Is he in the country?

29:55.260 --> 29:59.037
Well no, I talk to him. He's in, um…

29:59.698 --> 30:02.304
Costa Rica or, uh…

30:03.568 --> 30:06.139
Puerto Rico, or one of those Ricas.

30:09.408 --> 30:11.752
But you can contact him, right?

30:11.910 --> 30:15.380
Well see, I call this number and they
pick me up and they drive me around

30:15.447 --> 30:18.451
and then they take me to this
weird looking phone, and I call,

30:18.517 --> 30:21.828
but it sounds like he's
under water or someth’n.

30:21.887 --> 30:24.629
Grace, there's only one thing that
will tempt Horn to come back,

30:24.690 --> 30:25.828
the helicopter.

30:25.891 --> 30:29.270
You've got to convince him
that you know where it is.

30:29.328 --> 30:31.535
Well, I could do my best.

30:31.797 --> 30:35.244
Once you're absolutely certain
that he's coming in person,

30:35.300 --> 30:38.474
we'll give you a likely-sounding
location, and then when he shows up,

30:38.904 --> 30:41.350
we'll grab him, and you can just walk away.

30:42.441 --> 30:45.115
And you'll back me up if I need it?

30:45.177 --> 30:47.453
- Absolutely.
- Grace.

30:49.548 --> 30:52.290
Take a few minutes and you think about this.

30:52.351 --> 30:53.796
Michael.

31:08.500 --> 31:12.380
Are you sure there's nothing
else that you want to tell me?

31:13.472 --> 31:14.712
No.

31:15.907 --> 31:18.911
I mean, I don't know
what you want me to say.

31:20.045 --> 31:21.820
You know Grace,

31:22.881 --> 31:27.352
you're not the kind of person that should
be involved in something like this.

31:27.419 --> 31:29.990
And the only way that you're
going to make it through,

31:30.055 --> 31:33.696
is to quit playing games
and just tell the pure truth.

31:35.360 --> 31:38.034
But I did Hawke, honest.

31:42.067 --> 31:44.240
All right, if you're sure.

31:50.609 --> 31:51.952
Grace,

31:53.378 --> 31:55.187
you be careful.

32:09.594 --> 32:10.937
Did she tell you anything?

32:10.996 --> 32:12.134
No.

32:16.001 --> 32:17.844
You know Michael,

32:19.337 --> 32:21.715
sometimes this job really stinks.

32:24.209 --> 32:27.156
This is Bird Dog, we have subject in sight.

32:35.787 --> 32:39.997
Subject is leaving control vehicle
at Spring Avenue and Maple Drive.

32:49.167 --> 32:52.614
Subject is being picked up
in a late-model blue sedan.

32:52.671 --> 32:56.676
They are southbound on Maple Drive.
We are maintaining contact.

33:25.003 --> 33:28.450
We are maintaining contact, Subject
is still on Stevens Canyon Drive,

33:28.507 --> 33:30.612
just exiting the tunnel.

33:32.277 --> 33:33.813
We lost her.

33:36.047 --> 33:39.893
You know, I still don't believe
Grace was working with Horn.

33:39.951 --> 33:43.023
In fact, Horn probably arranged all this.

33:43.688 --> 33:47.761
Yeah, wouldn't it have been nice
if she could have lead us to him.

33:53.999 --> 33:57.469
Well, she didn't, so we'll
have to do it the hard way.

34:04.576 --> 34:06.419
So Grace,

34:06.478 --> 34:08.924
they were waiting for you to betray me, huh?

34:08.980 --> 34:10.425
We got them totally fooled, sir.

34:10.482 --> 34:11.927
Naturally.

34:13.083 --> 34:14.859
Did they mention Airwolf?

34:14.920 --> 34:16.763
Well, not exactly,

34:16.821 --> 34:20.792
but I'm pretty sure they've hidden
it on a field in that farm.

34:23.995 --> 34:25.940
Why do you say that, Grace?

34:25.996 --> 34:28.876
Well, it's just little hints, you know,

34:28.934 --> 34:31.346
veiled remarks, nods of the
head, things like that.

34:31.402 --> 34:32.710
I see.

34:32.904 --> 34:36.784
Yes, I bet they'd love me to come
to that field after Airwolf.

34:36.841 --> 34:40.219
They'd have quite a reception
committee waiting for me.

34:40.478 --> 34:41.650
I don't get it.

34:41.713 --> 34:42.987
It's simple, Grace.

34:43.547 --> 34:48.293
Hawke and the Firm don't just drop little
hints, they're too smart for that.

34:48.853 --> 34:51.993
They were deliberately
trying to mislead you.

34:52.056 --> 34:54.594
You mean they're just using me, too?

34:56.860 --> 34:58.636
But no matter,

34:59.965 --> 35:03.412
I know where they'll hide Airwolf.

35:04.903 --> 35:07.042
The only logical place.

35:09.107 --> 35:12.281
Your people did a pretty good job with that.

35:12.344 --> 35:15.985
You'd have to get up pretty close
to find out it's not Airwolf.

35:16.047 --> 35:18.152
That is, of course, if they show up at all.

35:18.216 --> 35:20.025
Remember, we're betting they won't.

35:20.085 --> 35:21.530
Oh, mama mia!

35:21.586 --> 35:23.623
I hope this thing
doesn't get so complicated

35:23.688 --> 35:25.668
that we're gonna outsmart ourselves.

35:25.724 --> 35:28.796
Well, there's always that possibility.
Maybe they'll take the bait.

35:28.860 --> 35:32.364
I don't see how you all can stand
around so calmly talking about this.

35:32.430 --> 35:34.501
You're gambling with Airwolf.
I think it's a big mistake.

35:34.566 --> 35:36.239
I know what you mean, Cate.

35:36.301 --> 35:39.839
It's like betting the
“Mona Lisa” on a roll of the dice.

35:41.206 --> 35:45.518
None of us like the idea very much,
but it's the only way to get Horn.

35:46.111 --> 35:47.419
Yeah, I guess.

36:29.487 --> 36:31.524
Horn grabbed Airwolf.

36:58.383 --> 37:00.727
They're still headed due west.

37:01.319 --> 37:03.162
Squad's ready, sir.

37:03.788 --> 37:05.529
Right. Let's go.

37:10.528 --> 37:12.439
- Here we go.
- All right, men, load it up.

37:12.497 --> 37:13.703
Come on, move it.

37:13.765 --> 37:15.870
Hey you 2, hurry up.

37:35.353 --> 37:37.663
This is Santini 1 to Archangel, over.

37:37.722 --> 37:39.599
Hawke, we read you.

37:39.991 --> 37:41.868
We've picked up the signal from Airwolf.

37:41.926 --> 37:43.872
Well, that's good news.

37:43.928 --> 37:45.737
Where they headed?

37:45.797 --> 37:49.472
Due west. If it continues its present
course, the likely destination is…

37:49.534 --> 37:50.740
The harbor, San Pedro.

37:50.802 --> 37:52.145
… the harbor at San Pedro.

37:52.203 --> 37:53.307
Listen to me.

37:53.371 --> 37:55.180
There's a park

37:55.240 --> 37:58.346
about a mile from the harbor on 2nd Avenue.

37:58.409 --> 37:59.547
We'll meet you there.

37:59.611 --> 38:01.181
Roger.

38:03.581 --> 38:06.585
Well, looks like everything's
going accord’n to plan.

38:06.651 --> 38:10.622
But I don't mind tell’n you I had nightmares
about that little beeper not work’n,

38:10.688 --> 38:13.897
and that guy Horn head’n south with my baby.

38:23.101 --> 38:25.342
Relax Gracie, it'll all be over soon.

38:25.470 --> 38:26.972
I'll be Mr. Horn's right-hand man

38:27.038 --> 38:28.483
and you'll be free as a bird.

38:28.540 --> 38:31.316
Oh, please God, let it be the truth.

38:31.576 --> 38:35.888
If I ever get outta this, I'm
going to get a job in a rest home.

38:36.214 --> 38:38.660
Guess it's been pretty rough
on a civilian like you.

38:38.716 --> 38:41.959
Yeah, now I know what
a Ping-Pong ball feels like.

38:46.891 --> 38:49.497
There it is, Grace. We're home free.

39:37.642 --> 39:39.019
So, how we do’n on time?

39:39.077 --> 39:41.683
We'll make it, let's
just hope Horn is there.

39:41.746 --> 39:44.124
- Where's the Lady?
- Right where we thought.

39:44.182 --> 39:46.423
Stopped at pier 11.

39:46.484 --> 39:48.191
What about Grace?

39:48.753 --> 39:51.632
I've assigned 2 men from the
Zebra Squad to watch out for her

39:51.689 --> 39:53.930
and protect her if she's there.

39:54.292 --> 39:56.602
It's the best I can do, Hawke.

40:25.990 --> 40:27.936
- Hello, Grace, Quist.
- Hi, Mr. Horn.

40:27.992 --> 40:29.494
If you'll excuse me.

40:35.934 --> 40:38.938
All right, get this ready for departure.

40:43.875 --> 40:45.548
You've done well.

40:45.843 --> 40:47.618
You both deserve a little reward.

40:47.679 --> 40:49.488
It's not necessary, sir.

40:49.547 --> 40:51.527
Gee, thanks a lot, Mr. Horn.

40:51.582 --> 40:55.724
John Horn always pays
top dollar for a top job.

41:09.367 --> 41:11.040
Get them!

41:12.136 --> 41:13.376
Get them!

41:52.643 --> 41:55.419
Hawke! Hawke! Hawke!

42:24.675 --> 42:26.052
Dom.

42:26.110 --> 42:27.987
Go fire up the Lady.

42:31.082 --> 42:32.959
All right, follow me.

42:36.487 --> 42:37.761
Grace?

42:45.897 --> 42:46.932
You'll be all right.

42:46.998 --> 42:49.478
No, not this time.

42:51.035 --> 42:55.745
It's only one miracle to a customer.

42:59.444 --> 43:00.650
I…

43:02.146 --> 43:03.557
I'm cold.

43:30.274 --> 43:32.880
She deserved better then that, Dom.

43:33.144 --> 43:36.091
It was her fight. You can't
blame yourself, String.

43:36.147 --> 43:39.185
There's really only one
reason Grace is dead,

43:39.584 --> 43:41.564
John Bradford Horn.

43:53.531 --> 43:55.101
Open their communication channel, Dom.

43:55.166 --> 43:56.372
Roger.

43:58.302 --> 44:00.976
Report, this is Stringfellow Hawke.

44:29.700 --> 44:31.873
Copperhead on the line.

44:49.787 --> 44:51.289
You know String, I hate to think

44:51.355 --> 44:54.097
what could’ve happened if Horn
had taken the Lady with him.

44:54.158 --> 44:56.195
Somethings wrong, Dom.

44:56.794 --> 44:57.898
It was too easy.

44:57.962 --> 45:00.806
Very perceptive, Hawke.
Better luck next time.

45:00.865 --> 45:02.105
Track him.

45:02.667 --> 45:03.771
I knew it.

45:03.834 --> 45:07.145
No time to track that source,
String. He's long gone.

45:07.205 --> 45:09.742
He's gotta be down there somewhere.

45:13.444 --> 45:15.219
Sure, but where?

45:16.305 --> 45:22.700
