00:10.958 --> 00:16.041
[narrator] In the beginning,
there was only the Primordial Mind.

00:16.125 --> 00:20.500
From this mind sprang
the whole of creation.

00:20.583 --> 00:26.166
The stars, the planets, life and death.

00:26.666 --> 00:31.583
But in time, the Mind
was divided against itself.

00:31.666 --> 00:38.541
Two fragments, the Radiant and the Dire,
thought and action,

00:38.625 --> 00:44.083
warred over creation
with irreconcilable ferocity.

00:44.166 --> 00:47.500
The Chaos of the Infinite followed.

00:50.541 --> 00:52.541
[ominous music]

00:53.875 --> 00:55.666
[narrator] Kings, queens.

00:56.708 --> 00:58.166
Gods.

00:58.250 --> 00:59.708
Monsters.

00:59.791 --> 01:04.041
They all sought wisdom
in the shattered Primordial Mind

01:04.125 --> 01:07.125
and power from its ineffable madness.

01:07.208 --> 01:08.916
[ominous music continues]

01:09.000 --> 01:12.333
But in his prison in Foulfell,

01:12.416 --> 01:16.208
the demon Terrorblade gazed into the chaos

01:17.083 --> 01:19.291
and found Truth.

01:20.166 --> 01:23.541
Terrorblade found the idea.

01:24.125 --> 01:26.916
Fuse thought and action.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.125
Remake creation in his own infernal image.

[Frühling] What the hell is he doing?

03:00.250 --> 03:02.791
Why isn't he killing the damn thing?

03:02.875 --> 03:05.166
Quiet. Watch the man work.

[epic music]

03:34.708 --> 03:36.208
[Bram] He's not coming out.

03:38.125 --> 03:39.458
They always come out.

03:41.041 --> 03:43.166
[Davion] Crazy, stupid…

03:43.875 --> 03:45.250
Here we go.

03:46.250 --> 03:48.000

[grunting]

04:45.791 --> 04:47.708
-Piece of shit!
-Hey!

04:48.208 --> 04:50.916
Dishonor my kill again, you're next.

04:51.416 --> 04:52.541
Dishonor it?

04:52.625 --> 04:56.875
Fucking thing killed four of mine,
injured at least five more.

04:56.958 --> 04:58.791
Gods! Another one!

05:02.583 --> 05:04.708
Hatchling. Dead.

05:05.583 --> 05:08.541
Hatchlings. Pups. Wee babies.

05:08.625 --> 05:11.000
[scoffs]
Bite your face off, boyo.

05:12.541 --> 05:14.208
[Davion] The entire nest…

05:14.791 --> 05:15.916
it's gone.

05:16.500 --> 05:20.250
They tore each other apart.
It's like they all went crazy.

05:20.750 --> 05:25.083
Like they all lost their minds
and turned on one another, all at once.

05:25.166 --> 05:27.625
Crazy wyrmlings, crazy hatchlings…

05:28.125 --> 05:29.750
I'm sure it's fine.

05:31.583 --> 05:33.958
This nest, it opens up.

05:46.166 --> 05:47.375
Bram.

05:52.083 --> 05:53.708
[Bram] An eldwyrm dug this.

05:54.291 --> 05:55.333
Asleep.

05:55.416 --> 05:56.875
How do you know?

05:56.958 --> 05:58.125
We're not dead.

05:58.750 --> 05:59.750
Asleep, then.

06:00.958 --> 06:02.291
Lovely.

06:03.083 --> 06:08.250
Now is our chance. Now we kill the beast.

06:08.333 --> 06:11.916
No. Now we pray he doesn't wake up.

06:16.833 --> 06:18.833
[ominous music]

06:23.708 --> 06:27.208
And when, pray you,
do we return to kill the big one?

06:28.375 --> 06:29.958
"Kill the big one?"

06:30.041 --> 06:31.916
Do you know how many living Dragon Knights

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
have ever seen a "big one"
that still had fire in its guts?

06:35.083 --> 06:37.750
Or whatever they have in their guts,
it varies from dragon to dragon.

06:37.833 --> 06:38.666
Bram.

06:39.250 --> 06:40.958
One. That's how many.

06:41.458 --> 06:43.416
Ah, you're afraid, then.

06:43.500 --> 06:45.625
We'll ride for Dragon Hold in the morning.

06:45.708 --> 06:47.458
Get advice, find help.

06:47.541 --> 06:51.583
But tonight, I plan to celebrate
the fact that I'm still breathing.

06:52.416 --> 06:53.625
As should you.

06:54.208 --> 06:55.416
You especially.

06:57.291 --> 06:59.583
[scoffs]
Coward.

07:01.250 --> 07:03.791
[villagers cheering]

07:08.375 --> 07:09.791
[Bram] All these people…

07:09.875 --> 07:11.333
Just for you.

07:12.666 --> 07:13.916
[Davion] For that.

07:14.541 --> 07:17.625
This morning they were terrified,
tonight they feel safe.

07:17.708 --> 07:20.416
All I'm doing is delivering their trophy.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.208
-Davion!
-Davion!

07:24.291 --> 07:26.500
Oh, no. Not for you.

07:26.583 --> 07:29.291
All right. It's a little bit for me.

07:29.958 --> 07:32.125
[villagers cheering]

07:32.916 --> 07:34.791
[woman sobbing]

07:35.375 --> 07:37.041
[cries]

07:38.958 --> 07:40.583
Your father was a militian.

07:41.625 --> 07:44.541
-Yes, sir.
-He was a brave son of a bitch.

07:45.375 --> 07:47.541
You look like you're
a brave son of a bitch, too.

07:47.625 --> 07:48.666
Like him.

07:50.125 --> 07:54.041
Here. I want you to have this.
Dragon fang.

07:55.416 --> 07:56.958
I've got one just like it. See?

07:57.833 --> 08:03.041
When you're of age, when you're ready,
take yours to Dragon Hold.

08:03.833 --> 08:05.208
They'll know what it means.

08:05.708 --> 08:10.166
I'll slay monsters too someday.
Just like father.

08:10.750 --> 08:12.083
Just like father.

08:13.500 --> 08:16.291
[Bram] Davion leaped left,
he leaped right.

08:16.375 --> 08:20.458
Bobbing and weaving as the great
beast lunged and snapped!

08:20.958 --> 08:26.375
Finally, knowing it was beaten,
the dragon fled under the earth!

08:26.458 --> 08:27.750
Davion followed.

08:27.833 --> 08:32.541
There, alone in the darkness,
he slew the beast!

08:33.041 --> 08:34.333
When we found him,

08:34.416 --> 08:37.708
covered in the enemy's black,
stinking blood,

08:37.791 --> 08:42.791
he said, "Tonight, we dine!
Tonight, we drink!

08:42.875 --> 08:45.541
The village is saved!"

08:45.625 --> 08:46.708
-[clanks]
-[cheering]

08:46.791 --> 08:49.083
[laughter]

08:49.958 --> 08:51.625
Of course, I played a critical role.

08:51.708 --> 08:53.833
He'd have been dead a hundred times
if I weren't there.

08:53.916 --> 08:55.666
A hundred times?

08:55.750 --> 08:57.833
A hundred times at least.

08:57.916 --> 08:59.208
At least!

09:02.375 --> 09:05.458
Worry not. I'll return
with fresh cups for everyone.

09:06.416 --> 09:09.125
-[indistinct chatter]
-[laughter]

09:09.208 --> 09:11.166
[merrymaking]

09:12.208 --> 09:15.041
-Barkeep, another round.
-Excuse me.

09:17.250 --> 09:18.583
I was waiting.

09:20.708 --> 09:24.000
Forgive me. I'm in my cups.
I didn't see you there.

09:24.083 --> 09:26.250
Please, help the lady.

09:26.333 --> 09:27.666
Thank you.

09:28.333 --> 09:30.000
An Icewrack white, please.

09:30.083 --> 09:33.083
Two glasses, chilled of course,
not so sharp.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.708
-[clanks]
-Two crowns.

09:38.625 --> 09:41.000
It smells terrible. And it's warm.

09:41.083 --> 09:43.333
It's beer. It's all we got.

09:43.416 --> 09:46.708
Wet, sour and sharp enough
to cut the head off a hellbear.

09:47.291 --> 09:49.208
-Smells like mom.
-But…

09:49.291 --> 09:51.666
-Two crowns.
-For this?

09:51.750 --> 09:56.625
-I'll pay for her Icewrack white.
-Oh, uh, in that case, they're free.

09:56.708 --> 10:02.791
Wait. If I order, it's two crowns.
If he orders, he pays nothing.

10:02.875 --> 10:05.791
Well, yeah. He's Davion
the fucking Dragon Knight

10:05.875 --> 10:07.250
what killed a fucking dragon.

10:07.333 --> 10:10.708
-This fucking dragon.
-Among others.

10:10.791 --> 10:12.916
Many, I'm sure.

10:13.000 --> 10:18.875
But the one, the big one,
you left down in that gods-empty hole!

10:18.958 --> 10:21.333
-Don't talk much about him.
-You're drunk.

10:21.833 --> 10:23.750
Tell her all about it.

10:23.833 --> 10:27.458
Tell her how you bravely ran away.

10:27.541 --> 10:30.166
If all your stories
were worth a steaming sod,

10:30.250 --> 10:31.541
you'd be killing that thing.

10:31.625 --> 10:33.083
Listen up, idiot.

10:33.166 --> 10:37.291
One man alone can't kill an eldwyrm,
nor 10, nor 20.

10:37.375 --> 10:38.958
It would be stupid to try.

10:39.541 --> 10:43.333
Waking that monster means death
for everyone within miles of here.

10:43.416 --> 10:46.083
Let the dragon sleep.

10:46.166 --> 10:51.416
Now, if you'll sod right off,
I was talking to the… lady.

10:52.083 --> 10:53.083
Shit.

10:53.166 --> 10:55.750
Ah! She thinks you're a coward, too.

10:55.833 --> 10:58.708
[laughter]

11:00.750 --> 11:01.750
[grumbles]

11:03.500 --> 11:05.083
Icewrack white.

11:10.458 --> 11:12.166
It's supposed to be warm.

11:14.208 --> 11:16.083
A human tavern.

11:16.666 --> 11:17.500
[Mirana] Barely.

11:17.583 --> 11:19.541
[Gwanwyn] This isn't exactly neutral.

11:19.625 --> 11:23.291
I assume you would've preferred
a dark alley or the foothills.

11:24.041 --> 11:25.333
The better to rob me.

11:25.416 --> 11:26.750
Rob you?
[sighs]

11:26.833 --> 11:31.375
Locating precious things for the wealthy
is more lucrative than stealing from them.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.041
My lotuses.

11:34.000 --> 11:39.000
Selemene's lotuses. The usurper's lotuses.

11:39.083 --> 11:40.583
I don't really care.

11:40.666 --> 11:42.875
I care only to make them mine now.

11:42.958 --> 11:44.333
I don't have your lotuses.

11:44.416 --> 11:48.500
What I do have is a name.
Travel to the Black Market in Haupstadt.

11:48.583 --> 11:50.958
Ask for Nikdo. He'll arrange the rest.

11:51.041 --> 11:52.875
You promised to bring them.

11:52.958 --> 11:54.958
[Gwanwyn] I promised to find them.

11:55.041 --> 11:56.958
Now, the matter of my payment.

11:57.041 --> 11:59.208
I'm not paying for a name.

11:59.958 --> 12:02.833
Then I'll find Nikdo
and tell him there's no bargain.

12:02.916 --> 12:04.208
Safe travels, miss.

12:04.291 --> 12:05.208
Wait.

12:05.708 --> 12:07.791
I don't have money.

12:07.875 --> 12:10.958
But I do have other items of value.

12:11.041 --> 12:13.250
Oh, sorry. Not interested.

12:13.333 --> 12:17.583
Human women are pleasantly soft,
but too easy to come by.

12:18.583 --> 12:20.583
That's not my offer.

12:20.666 --> 12:21.833
This.

12:22.833 --> 12:25.625
This bracelet. Your tiara.

12:25.708 --> 12:27.958
I know who you are.

12:28.625 --> 12:32.333
[banging]
Ah! My future ex-wife.

12:33.083 --> 12:36.833
And my other future ex-wife. Huh?
[laughs]

12:36.916 --> 12:39.416
Never come down from the throne
to address a peasant.

12:39.500 --> 12:43.416
Oh, I see.
Skinny bastard is your boyfriend.

12:43.500 --> 12:45.208
Been stepping out on me, huh?

12:45.291 --> 12:48.083
Snogging my future ex-wife, are we?

12:48.166 --> 12:51.500
Believe me when I tell you,
I would never dare tread

12:51.583 --> 12:54.458
where you've set foot or anything else.

12:54.541 --> 12:56.541
[laughs]
Oh!

12:56.625 --> 12:59.375
Ah! Insulting me now, huh?

12:59.458 --> 13:01.166
[groans]

13:01.250 --> 13:02.541
[grunts]

13:04.041 --> 13:05.333
[gasps]

13:05.416 --> 13:09.833
-Elf! Filthy spawn of tree rot.
-[villagers gasp]

13:09.916 --> 13:12.458
Long-eared murderous animal.

13:13.291 --> 13:17.041
Cousin of mine wandered
into one of your enclaves once.

13:17.541 --> 13:22.708
Came out half-mad,
minus an arm and two balls.

13:23.291 --> 13:28.833
Elves cut him a smile ear to ear.

13:30.958 --> 13:32.041
[Davion] Wait here.

13:33.125 --> 13:34.833
He's holding me in reserve.

13:35.333 --> 13:38.291
Think I'll cut you one to match it.

13:38.375 --> 13:40.458
-[drunk villager growls]
-[grunts]

13:40.541 --> 13:41.666
Enough talk.

13:43.791 --> 13:45.875
I'll handle this animal myself.

13:47.458 --> 13:49.166
[elf pants]

13:52.250 --> 13:54.958
[Davion] This seems like the right place
to drop the garbage.

13:56.500 --> 13:57.541
Run.

13:58.208 --> 13:59.833
Now, while you can.

14:02.083 --> 14:05.291
Nikdo. In Haupstadt, Princess.

14:06.125 --> 14:07.333
Princess?

14:08.958 --> 14:10.791
You get more interesting by the minute.

14:10.875 --> 14:15.750
Most men would've left him to the mob.
Most men would've joined it.

14:15.833 --> 14:18.541
I'm not most men. Barkeep!

14:18.625 --> 14:21.083
Another round for all my friends!

14:23.375 --> 14:24.583
"Princess."

14:26.125 --> 14:28.708
[horses snort]

14:31.541 --> 14:32.875
[screams]

14:36.250 --> 14:39.000
[grumbles]
I'm not afraid of any dragon!

14:39.083 --> 14:40.291
[clanks]

14:40.958 --> 14:44.375
Hear me! I'm not afraid of you!

14:46.000 --> 14:48.291
[grunts]
Not afraid.

14:49.958 --> 14:52.041
[Terrorblade] Not afraid?

14:53.125 --> 14:55.958
I can still smell the piss on your leg.

14:56.041 --> 14:57.666
Everyone knows.

14:58.166 --> 15:02.416
Everyone laughs at you, Captain.

15:02.500 --> 15:03.583
Shut up.

15:04.083 --> 15:05.791
[sword clanking]

15:06.375 --> 15:08.875
[Terrorblade]
You're the joke of the village.

15:09.458 --> 15:11.625
Sad and pathetic.

15:12.458 --> 15:13.750
A coward.

15:13.833 --> 15:14.916
Shut up!

15:15.000 --> 15:18.416
[Terrorblade] Rage. Yes.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.291
Oh, we can use that.

15:20.833 --> 15:22.833
Yes, we can.

15:22.916 --> 15:28.416
We can slay that beast. You and I.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.541
And no one ever has to know
your secret terror.

15:34.250 --> 15:37.500
Your impotence. I'll do all the work.

15:37.583 --> 15:40.041
All you have to do…

15:40.833 --> 15:42.250
is let me in.

15:43.291 --> 15:45.416
[ominous music]

15:50.041 --> 15:51.958
[rooster crowing]

16:08.083 --> 16:09.750
Did you want another go?

16:10.583 --> 16:13.208
No. Not really. I, I just…

16:13.875 --> 16:15.458
It's fine. I'm fine.

16:15.958 --> 16:17.666
Sleep, lovely.

16:17.750 --> 16:20.125
-You don't even know my name, do you?
-[Bram] Davion!

16:20.208 --> 16:22.916
It's all right. I know yours.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.750
-Davion.
-[Bram] Davion!

16:25.750 --> 16:26.916
Davion, wake up!

16:27.000 --> 16:29.291
Gods' mercy, Bram, I hear you.

16:29.375 --> 16:31.166
-[Davion] Come in.
-Oh, finally!

16:31.250 --> 16:33.333
Searched every room for you.
I woke up half the…

16:33.416 --> 16:34.666
[chuckles]
Hey, ma'am.

16:34.750 --> 16:37.458
It's Captain Frühling.
He's gone to the foothills.

16:38.916 --> 16:40.833
[Davion] Moron. Brainless, arrogant…

16:40.916 --> 16:43.000
He means to kill the eldwyrm.

16:43.583 --> 16:48.041
I'm going after him.
I'll try to stop him. One way or another.

16:48.125 --> 16:50.166
-I'm coming with you.
-[Davion] You won't.

16:50.250 --> 16:53.208
Go to Dragon Hold.
The Fathers need to know.

16:53.291 --> 16:55.083
They need to send everyone.

17:01.666 --> 17:03.791
[sighs]
Always hated this part.

17:04.833 --> 17:06.166
[Bram] Oh, shit.

17:08.833 --> 17:09.833
[grunts]

17:11.333 --> 17:13.333
[Bram] Hoping I show up
in Dragon Hold with a head.

17:13.416 --> 17:14.750
And both arms.

17:14.833 --> 17:16.166
And they'll both be mine.

17:16.791 --> 17:17.625
Eridu.

17:19.333 --> 17:21.416
[grunts]

17:21.500 --> 17:23.000
-Huh?
-[groans]

17:23.083 --> 17:25.625
[zapping]

17:27.000 --> 17:28.083
How?

17:28.583 --> 17:30.583
[birds chirping]

17:34.500 --> 17:36.166
[sighs deeply]

17:39.041 --> 17:40.083
[grunts]

17:41.625 --> 17:42.708
[rumbling]

17:54.125 --> 17:55.375
Frühling.

17:55.458 --> 17:58.041
[yelps, grunts]

17:59.750 --> 18:04.125
Dragon Knight, we do the gods' work here.

18:04.625 --> 18:08.333
You and I, we should be friends.

18:08.416 --> 18:11.625
Friends? Frühling, what did you do?

18:12.208 --> 18:15.458
No man is capable of… this.

18:15.541 --> 18:19.083
Uldorak was old. Sick.

18:19.166 --> 18:23.666
Yet even his powers at their height
could not have saved him.

18:24.375 --> 18:26.250
Not from me.

18:26.750 --> 18:28.625
What in the Seven Hells?

18:29.375 --> 18:31.791
Your voice. Your eyes…

18:34.083 --> 18:35.041
[Davion] Gods.

18:35.125 --> 18:38.916
Tell me, Dragon Knight, Davion.

18:39.416 --> 18:42.541
If you could do what has been done,

18:42.625 --> 18:47.250
if you had the power,
wouldn't you take it?

18:47.333 --> 18:53.208
The little boy who stood frozen
as his father burned alive.

18:53.291 --> 18:55.458
I was just a child. How do you--?

18:55.541 --> 18:59.708
Childhood evaporated
with your father's flesh.

18:59.791 --> 19:04.083
A boy made man by your despair.

19:04.166 --> 19:08.125
Your rage. I know you.

19:08.625 --> 19:13.541
I see you,
trapped in your own hell of regret.

19:13.625 --> 19:16.500
What wouldn't you do to escape?

19:16.583 --> 19:19.541
-[Davion] You know nothing.
-I know this much.

19:20.083 --> 19:23.375
Together, we can slay dragons.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.166
Every dragon.

19:27.416 --> 19:34.416
All you have to do is let me in.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.666
[Slyrak] You will release Uldorak's soul

19:40.750 --> 19:44.833
so he may rejoin the Thunder
and take new form.

19:44.916 --> 19:47.416
[rumbling]

19:49.833 --> 19:51.500
[Terrorblade through Frühling]
Slyrak.

19:52.125 --> 19:54.166
Father of Fire.

19:54.250 --> 19:59.375
The Thunder speaks
and chooses you to give it voice.

19:59.458 --> 20:04.083
I'll collect your soul
as I collected Uldorak's.

20:04.750 --> 20:09.375
[Slyrak] Uldorak was ready for death.
The madness was upon him.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.041
The weakness.

20:12.041 --> 20:15.250
I am not so disadvantaged.

20:19.041 --> 20:20.041
[grunts]

20:24.250 --> 20:25.916
[epic music]

20:32.416 --> 20:34.750
[Slyrak] Run, little mouse.

20:35.416 --> 20:42.416
Count yourself fortunate
I have no taste for manflesh today.

20:44.875 --> 20:46.208
[Terrorblade] Dragons.

20:47.500 --> 20:49.333
No imagination.

20:49.416 --> 20:51.416
All brute force.

20:52.500 --> 20:54.000
No cunning.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.875
[zapping]

21:01.083 --> 21:03.000
[epic music]

21:07.000 --> 21:09.333
No guile.

21:10.250 --> 21:11.833
Weak.

21:14.250 --> 21:16.500
[suspenseful music]

21:19.666 --> 21:21.000
[roars]

21:21.625 --> 21:22.750
[snarls]

21:36.916 --> 21:38.250
[snarls]

21:43.333 --> 21:44.541
[explosion]

21:47.458 --> 21:49.291
[fire roaring]

22:00.083 --> 22:01.625
[snarling]

22:02.250 --> 22:03.500
[shrieks]

22:10.791 --> 22:12.208
[rumbling]

22:15.500 --> 22:19.500
[heavy thudding]

22:24.291 --> 22:25.208
Fuck.

22:25.708 --> 22:30.708
I smell your fear.

22:31.708 --> 22:35.041
Only my hate!

22:40.250 --> 22:42.250
[epic music]

22:43.291 --> 22:44.708
[grunts]

22:54.708 --> 22:55.958
[grunting]

22:56.041 --> 22:58.000
[yells]

23:03.166 --> 23:07.041
[Slyrak] Brave little mouse.

23:10.541 --> 23:11.750
[Davion grunts]

23:12.375 --> 23:13.958
[yelps, grunts]

23:17.708 --> 23:21.666
[blast]

23:28.333 --> 23:29.500
The demon…

23:30.208 --> 23:33.125
Fled to the hell he calls home.

23:33.708 --> 23:38.833
Uldorak, his soul lost.

23:38.916 --> 23:40.333
[groans]

23:46.416 --> 23:48.208
I couldn't just let him…

23:48.875 --> 23:49.750
I…

23:49.833 --> 23:53.166
You chose a side.

23:53.250 --> 23:56.250
[ragged breaths]

23:58.541 --> 23:59.958
[Davion] Sleep, dragon.

24:00.708 --> 24:01.750
Die in peace.

24:02.333 --> 24:05.916
I want nothing of peace, little mouse.

24:06.875 --> 24:10.125
You know of the death I want.

24:11.208 --> 24:12.833
You fought well.

24:15.541 --> 24:17.666
You honor me.

24:19.833 --> 24:21.333
As you honor me.

24:22.083 --> 24:23.208
[grunts]

24:27.416 --> 24:28.833
[gasps]

24:30.000 --> 24:31.291
[choking gasps]

24:35.791 --> 24:38.666
[Slyrak] Forgive me, little mouse.

24:43.625 --> 24:47.541
For all the suffering you will now endure.

24:52.250 --> 24:53.750
[Mirana] Drunk and naked.

24:54.291 --> 24:56.416
The best help I could offer
is to let him sleep,

24:56.500 --> 24:57.583
and when he wakes,

24:57.666 --> 25:00.416
understand he must make
better life choices.

25:01.041 --> 25:04.000
It's not my responsibility
to protect people from themselves,

25:04.083 --> 25:07.291
no matter what good and noble qualities
they might possess.

25:10.333 --> 25:12.666
Don't look at me that way, Marci.

25:12.750 --> 25:15.166
You can't possibly know
he would come to my aid

25:15.250 --> 25:16.250
if the tables were turned.

25:16.833 --> 25:18.750
Which they never would be.

25:19.250 --> 25:21.125
I should hardly need to tell you.

25:25.333 --> 25:26.416
Fine.

25:27.208 --> 25:30.458
Get him up, but put a cloak on him
for decency's sake.

25:31.833 --> 25:36.208
You will not be happy when you awaken,
Davion the Dragon Knight.

25:37.375 --> 25:38.666
[Mirana] But you'll live.

25:41.291 --> 25:43.291
[closing theme music]
