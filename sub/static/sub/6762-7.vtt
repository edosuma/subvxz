01:35.957 --> 01:38.115
Brandon, you better give me
your toothbrush and stuff

01:38.334 --> 01:40.907
- if you want me to pack them for you.
- l'll be right there.

01:42.589 --> 01:44.415
l hope you're not finding
more stuff to take.

01:44.590 --> 01:46.499
Your half the bag is already full.

01:48.261 --> 01:49.920
- Brandon, are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:50.096 --> 01:51.258
What is that?

01:51.430 --> 01:52.461
lt's my lucky hat.

01:52.640 --> 01:55.391
l'm sorry, Brandon,
but that is one nerdy-looking thing.

01:55.559 --> 01:56.638
Come on, l think it's cool.

01:56.810 --> 01:58.352
Well, maybe to a beaver.

01:58.520 --> 02:00.845
Brandon, you have got
to do something about your friend.

02:01.023 --> 02:02.054
Who, Steve?

02:02.232 --> 02:03.774
Yes, he is unpacking
Donna's suitcases.

02:03.942 --> 02:05.768
He says she's exceeded
her luggage allowance.

02:05.944 --> 02:08.150
Yeah, l'll see what l can do.

02:08.321 --> 02:09.863
Why is Steve so uptight?

02:10.031 --> 02:12.438
There's more than enough room
for six people in that van.

02:12.617 --> 02:15.701
Try seven. My mother's
making me bring David.

02:15.870 --> 02:18.574
David Silver, David?
Are you serious?

02:18.748 --> 02:21.535
His dad and my mom are going away
for the weekend.

02:21.709 --> 02:24.081
- Oh, that does sound serious.
- Yeah.

02:24.253 --> 02:27.289
So instead of staying home alone,
he has to tag along with us.

02:27.464 --> 02:30.667
Well, Kel, it might not be so bad.

02:31.218 --> 02:33.376
Yeah, he'll probably videotape
the whole trip for us.

02:33.553 --> 02:35.545
Oh, right. Yosemite: The Movie.

02:35.722 --> 02:38.259
Well, at least we can show Dylan
what he missed out on.

02:38.433 --> 02:39.547
He's not coming?

02:39.726 --> 02:41.635
No, since his mom moved back
from Hawaii.

02:41.811 --> 02:43.353
He just doesn't want
to cut out on her.

02:43.521 --> 02:45.228
He wants to make sure
she's all settled in.

02:45.898 --> 02:49.646
Donna, nobody takes shoulder pads
on a camping trip.

02:51.111 --> 02:52.770
Brandon, tell him
to give them back to me.

02:52.946 --> 02:55.271
And she doesn't need 1 6 bags
of makeup, okay?

02:55.491 --> 02:57.530
- Steve is not my father--
- Don't you understand--

02:57.701 --> 02:59.527
Hey, hey, hey.

02:59.745 --> 03:01.404
Now, Donna,
Steve does have a good point.

03:01.580 --> 03:04.070
- Thank you.
- You'll never wear half this stuff.

03:04.249 --> 03:07.202
And as far as l'm concerned,
you never need makeup anyway.

03:07.377 --> 03:09.867
Well, thank you.

03:10.088 --> 03:11.498
Now, let's get going, all right?

03:11.672 --> 03:14.542
We're gonna have a great time
once we get on the road.

03:14.759 --> 03:15.957
Dylan, what's the rumpus?

03:16.135 --> 03:18.092
Hey, nice wheels,
for a mobile home.

03:18.262 --> 03:19.542
Oh, yeah? She's got everything.

03:19.763 --> 03:22.929
Four-wheel drive, cruise control,
removable seats.

03:23.100 --> 03:25.590
lf it had a john, we could live in it.

03:25.769 --> 03:27.049
Send me a postcard, man.

03:27.271 --> 03:29.180
Thanks for the bags.

03:30.315 --> 03:33.315
Dylan, sorry you're not coming
with us, man.

03:33.485 --> 03:35.062
Oh, it's probably better anyway.

03:35.278 --> 03:36.820
My mom said
that my planetary alignment

03:36.988 --> 03:38.779
is in severe disarray.

03:39.866 --> 03:41.324
ls that contagious?

03:41.534 --> 03:43.941
lt must be. She's gotta go
to the desert this weekend.

03:44.120 --> 03:45.614
l'm not invited.

03:45.788 --> 03:47.910
So much for quality time with Mom.

03:48.999 --> 03:50.078
Are you okay with that?

03:50.292 --> 03:53.660
Are you kidding, man? l am so sick
of her cosmic mumbo jumbo.

03:53.837 --> 03:55.414
So, Jones, come with us.

03:55.589 --> 03:57.415
- Come on.
- l don't think so.

03:57.632 --> 03:59.505
Wait, wait a second...

03:59.676 --> 04:01.383
Just got a message
from my cosmic advisor.

04:01.553 --> 04:05.632
Your planets need aligning muy pronto
in the Yosemite Valley. l swear it.

04:05.807 --> 04:07.431
- l don't know--
- No, hey, now.

04:07.600 --> 04:10.434
The planets get very touchy
when you argue with them.

04:11.145 --> 04:12.971
Since you put it that way...

04:13.147 --> 04:15.637
- l gotta get my jacket.
- Cool, l'll get you some gear.

04:16.317 --> 04:19.233
Captain Steve, make room
for one more. McKay's coming with.

04:19.403 --> 04:23.067
Oh, great. l'll just rearrange
a few hundred bags.

04:24.616 --> 04:26.988
Okay, be extra careful
on those steep hiking trails.

04:27.160 --> 04:28.702
- We will.
- And be sure to head back

04:28.870 --> 04:30.068
to the camp well before dark.

04:30.247 --> 04:31.741
- We will.
- And make sure those boys

04:31.915 --> 04:33.029
stay on top of you.

04:33.208 --> 04:34.406
When you're hiking, that is.

04:34.584 --> 04:36.291
Mom, don't worry.
Dylan's not even coming.

04:36.461 --> 04:37.836
Oh, yes, he is.

04:38.004 --> 04:40.329
- He is? Since when?
- Since now. Here, open up this bag.

04:40.506 --> 04:41.537
Brandon, it's too full.

04:41.716 --> 04:44.503
Well, you don't want Dylan
to go naked, do you?

04:44.677 --> 04:45.708
Or do you?

04:45.886 --> 04:48.341
Let's just see what we can do.

04:48.931 --> 04:50.638
Brandon,
where is your sister already?

04:50.808 --> 04:53.381
lf we don't leave soon, we'll never
make it to camp before dark.

04:53.560 --> 04:56.133
Steve, you gotta get over
this rush-hour mentality of yours.

04:56.313 --> 04:59.313
l keep trying to tell you,
think vacation, think fun.

04:59.482 --> 05:00.644
Think, ''Let's go.''

05:00.817 --> 05:02.690
l'll get her.

05:12.036 --> 05:13.660
Need a hand?

05:14.288 --> 05:15.367
Yes.

05:15.539 --> 05:17.911
l always knew you'd turn out
to be good for something.

05:18.125 --> 05:21.244
Well, when you figure out what it is,
let me know.

05:21.420 --> 05:23.957
You're very sensitive these days.

05:24.131 --> 05:25.874
Maybe l shouldn't be going.

05:26.049 --> 05:27.080
You have to go.

05:27.259 --> 05:28.918
Why do l have to go?

05:29.678 --> 05:32.299
Because l just repacked
this whole thing for you.

05:35.683 --> 05:37.342
Because l want you to go.

05:38.311 --> 05:40.932
You won't feel a little weird
with me there?

05:41.105 --> 05:42.764
Why should l feel weird?

05:42.982 --> 05:44.689
l mean, this is a completely platonic
trip.

05:44.859 --> 05:47.231
Separate cabins, boys and girls.

05:47.403 --> 05:49.691
Listen, it'll do you good
to get away with some friends.

05:49.863 --> 05:51.107
lt'll be fun.

05:52.491 --> 05:57.615
You know, you and your brother,
you're like twins, or something.

05:59.539 --> 06:01.282
l'm coming!

06:01.458 --> 06:03.082
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

06:03.251 --> 06:04.910
All right.

06:11.217 --> 06:12.592
All right, everybody listen up.

06:12.760 --> 06:14.467
Brandon's got a little announcement
to make

06:14.637 --> 06:18.052
and then we're out of here.
Come on, come on, don't be shy.

06:18.640 --> 06:21.474
l know l don't have to remind any of
you that school starts next week.

06:21.685 --> 06:23.843
So let's get a little national park spirit
going here,

06:24.020 --> 06:27.720
and focus in on the fact that we're all
young, free, healthy, wealthy and wise,

06:27.941 --> 06:30.514
and about to embark on probably
the most righteous journey

06:30.693 --> 06:32.103
of our lives thus far.

06:32.278 --> 06:34.104
Let's get busy.

06:38.159 --> 06:41.693
Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall
Ninety-nine bottles of beer

06:41.871 --> 06:44.029
David, not that one, please.

06:44.248 --> 06:45.576
How about...

06:45.749 --> 06:48.453
Yosemite here we come

06:48.627 --> 06:51.414
Right back where we started from

06:51.588 --> 06:54.125
The flowers, the flowers
They bloom in the spring

06:55.884 --> 06:57.757
Birdies singin' everything

06:57.927 --> 07:01.093
Sun shines bright
So don't be late

07:25.370 --> 07:27.777
So anyone know
any good rain songs?

07:29.999 --> 07:33.248
Look at that. Who in the world would
come here for their honeymoon?

07:33.461 --> 07:35.583
l don't know, maybe a duck or a frog?

07:35.796 --> 07:38.037
l cannot believe you forgot
to check the weather report.

07:38.215 --> 07:40.172
l didn't forget to check
the weather report.

07:40.342 --> 07:42.251
l just didn't believe
the weather report.

07:42.469 --> 07:43.797
God, l'm freezing.

07:43.971 --> 07:47.256
l'd give you my coat,
but it's a little wet.

07:47.474 --> 07:48.968
Well, if Mr. Good Samaritan
over there

07:49.142 --> 07:52.391
hadn't have us stop
to change old bozo's tyre,

07:52.562 --> 07:54.435
l think we would've been
through the Tioga Pass

07:54.606 --> 07:56.645
before the highway patrol
closed the roads.

07:56.858 --> 08:00.143
Hey, come on, guys,
this is a minor setback.

08:01.112 --> 08:04.812
- Remember, guys, we're on vacation.
- Vacation.

08:13.666 --> 08:17.533
Okay, there is good news
and there is bad news.

08:17.753 --> 08:19.163
Good news, please.

08:19.379 --> 08:22.048
The good news
is there's one cabin left.

08:22.215 --> 08:24.373
What's the bad news?

08:32.892 --> 08:35.726
Well, at least l negotiated
a reduced room rate.

08:35.895 --> 08:37.389
You got what you paid for.

08:37.563 --> 08:39.354
The accommodations,
though sparse,

08:39.523 --> 08:42.274
have got an undeniably
rustic ambience.

08:42.443 --> 08:44.649
Turn that thing off already.

08:44.862 --> 08:46.735
Hey, come on, you guys,
it's not that bad.

08:46.905 --> 08:49.277
Well, yeah, if you don't mind
the smell of mildew.

08:49.491 --> 08:52.527
There aren't enough beds.
Where are we all gonna sleep?

08:53.370 --> 08:55.243
Hey, we'll get it worked out.

08:55.455 --> 08:57.281
We've all got our own sleeping bags,
remember?

08:57.457 --> 08:59.248
Great, the floor's wet though.

08:59.459 --> 09:03.408
Okay, maybe it'll dry
if we get a fire going.

09:03.588 --> 09:06.505
Well, not with this wood. lt's soaked.

09:06.716 --> 09:07.830
l need a good hot bath.

09:08.008 --> 09:10.333
- Don't count on it, Kelly.
- No tub?

09:10.511 --> 09:13.879
No hot water. Oh, and be careful
with the toilet seat, it's got splinters.

09:14.056 --> 09:15.087
Oh, terrific.

09:15.265 --> 09:17.886
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

09:18.101 --> 09:19.892
Over there. Over there.
A big spider.

09:20.103 --> 09:21.810
- A big one.
- Okay.

09:21.980 --> 09:25.514
Sorry, Charlotte. You are history.

09:25.733 --> 09:29.481
l've had some bad experiences
with spiders.

09:29.696 --> 09:31.735
lt's okay. l feel the exact same way
about rodents.

09:31.906 --> 09:34.776
Maybe there's some bug spray
under the counter...

09:35.409 --> 09:37.235
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

09:37.411 --> 09:39.818
That's it, you guys are right.
This place is terrible.

09:40.039 --> 09:41.663
What's the matter, Bren?

09:41.874 --> 09:43.202
Mousetrap under the sink.

09:43.417 --> 09:45.575
- Empty or full?
- Empty.

09:45.794 --> 09:48.082
But the cheese was nibbled.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.749
Oh, my God.

09:49.965 --> 09:52.253
Then what's the problem, Bren?
There's no mouse.

09:53.593 --> 09:57.008
Look, you guys, l'm gonna go get
some dry firewood,

09:57.180 --> 10:01.557
make a fire, warm this place up
as soon as l change my clothes,

10:01.726 --> 10:04.263
especially my shoes.

10:04.770 --> 10:07.142
Bren, where are my hiking boots?

10:08.065 --> 10:09.772
By the bed.

10:11.944 --> 10:13.568
Where?

10:14.988 --> 10:17.905
By my bed.

10:18.116 --> 10:20.571
ln my room in our house,

10:20.785 --> 10:23.240
where l really sort of wish
l was right now.

10:23.913 --> 10:25.739
You left my hiking boots
by your bed?

10:26.791 --> 10:30.622
My perfectly broken in,
dry hiking boots by your bed?

10:30.795 --> 10:34.329
So now l have to climb up Half Dome
in sopping wet, slippery tennis shoes,

10:34.507 --> 10:36.914
because you left my hiking boots
by your bed?

10:40.804 --> 10:42.214
l just have one question.

10:42.389 --> 10:43.420
What's that?

10:43.599 --> 10:45.971
Are we having fun yet?

10:53.274 --> 10:54.768
Soggy sandwiches.

10:54.943 --> 10:56.900
- Soggy muffins.
- Soggy cheese balls.

10:57.070 --> 10:58.612
Well, at least we're consistent.

10:58.780 --> 11:00.571
l wish they had a TV Guide here.

11:00.740 --> 11:02.317
Donna, there's no TV.

11:02.491 --> 11:04.863
l know, but l just like to know
what l'm missing.

11:05.077 --> 11:06.191
What l'm missing is music.

11:06.370 --> 11:08.860
l can't believe
nobody brought a CD player.

11:09.957 --> 11:10.988
l almost forgot.

11:11.166 --> 11:13.372
All right, Donna comes through
in the clutch.

11:13.585 --> 11:15.910
And you were hassling her
about bringing too much luggage.

11:19.049 --> 11:21.088
That's only good
for one person, Donna.

11:21.259 --> 11:23.050
Well, we could take turns.

11:23.219 --> 11:24.333
That's stupid.

11:24.554 --> 11:27.507
Not as stupid as driving hundreds
of miles through a rainstorm.

11:28.724 --> 11:30.597
- Hey, where are you going, man?
- Beer run.

11:30.768 --> 11:32.843
- l'm gonna liven up this joint.
- Steve, forget it.

11:33.062 --> 11:35.137
- Brandon, come on.
- Don't look at me, partner.

11:35.314 --> 11:36.689
My drinking days are over.

11:36.899 --> 11:38.393
- Dylan?
- You know he doesn't drink.

11:38.567 --> 11:40.358
Why are you trying to tempt him?

11:40.569 --> 11:43.190
Excuse me, l can answer for myself.

11:50.829 --> 11:52.786
Not this time, man.

11:52.997 --> 11:54.788
- l'll go.
- What would your dad say?

11:54.999 --> 11:56.161
Hey, leave him alone.

11:56.334 --> 11:58.706
Not everybody in this party's
got to be a deadbeat.

11:58.920 --> 12:02.205
You know, you guys
make a perfect pair. Mutt and Jeff.

12:03.132 --> 12:05.504
You know, you say
you don't want any now,

12:05.718 --> 12:09.169
but when l break out the six-packs,
you'll all be begging for a brewski.

12:09.388 --> 12:10.668
lf you can get any.

12:10.889 --> 12:12.264
Which really isn't likely.

12:12.474 --> 12:14.846
lf l say l'll deliver, l'll deliver.

12:15.727 --> 12:17.386
Let's go.

12:18.730 --> 12:21.185
- l'll go too.
- Donna?

12:21.399 --> 12:22.774
For the ride.

12:22.942 --> 12:25.397
Don't encourage him, all right?

12:25.903 --> 12:29.188
There's something l need to get
while we're out.

12:29.907 --> 12:32.148
- Like what?
- Yeah, like what?

12:34.954 --> 12:36.364
A feminine product, okay?

12:36.580 --> 12:38.453
ls everyone happy now?

12:42.419 --> 12:43.961
Hey, it's too bad you guys
can't get me

12:44.129 --> 12:46.287
a new pair of hiking boots
while you're at it.

12:48.299 --> 12:50.587
Look, it was an oversight
and l said l was sorry.

12:50.760 --> 12:53.085
What about my lucky hat?
Was that an oversight too?

12:53.262 --> 12:54.839
How'd you expect me
to fit everything in

12:55.014 --> 12:57.884
when you had me pack
all those extra clothes for...?

13:00.019 --> 13:01.892
Hey, l'm sorry,
l shouldn't have come.

13:02.062 --> 13:06.011
That way you'd have your lucky charm
instead of a cosmic jinx.

13:24.083 --> 13:25.874
Dylan, where are you going?

13:26.043 --> 13:29.209
To get a soda, if you don't mind.

13:29.380 --> 13:31.289
What l said about the clothes,
l didn't mean it.

13:31.507 --> 13:32.538
Okay, forget it.

13:32.716 --> 13:35.835
And listen, about the beer,
why did you say, ''Not this time''?

13:36.011 --> 13:38.762
- What are you, my mother?
- l'm just worried about you, that's all.

13:38.972 --> 13:42.091
Oh, well, you are definitely
not my mother.

13:44.894 --> 13:46.803
Look, if we're gonna salvage
this weekend,

13:46.980 --> 13:49.767
all of us need to mellow out a little bit,
including you.

13:49.983 --> 13:52.604
l just don't feel like being the life
of the party, okay?

13:53.236 --> 13:56.153
That's okay, just try not
to be the death of it.

13:58.866 --> 14:00.905
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:01.118 --> 14:03.359
This is going to sound
like l'm asking for spare change,

14:03.537 --> 14:05.743
but do you, by any chance,
have an extra quarter?

14:06.290 --> 14:09.409
- Sure.
- Thank you, thanks a lot.

14:09.584 --> 14:12.288
You aren't, by any chance,
on your honeymoon, are you?

14:13.505 --> 14:14.963
Not too obvious, huh?

14:15.131 --> 14:16.459
Yeah, we saw your car.

14:19.052 --> 14:21.721
Oh, Neil, you didn't have to do that.

14:21.888 --> 14:25.967
Oh, yes, l did. l missed you.

14:28.936 --> 14:31.936
Do you have a quarter, sweetheart?
l had to borrow one from...

14:32.106 --> 14:35.557
- What's your name?
- Brenda, and this is Dylan.

14:35.776 --> 14:38.313
l'm Alison
and this is my husband, Neil.

14:38.487 --> 14:41.108
Do you like the sound of that, honey?
My husband, Neil.

14:41.323 --> 14:43.232
Music to my ears.

14:43.408 --> 14:46.112
Let's go back to our cabin
and you can sing it to me.

14:47.203 --> 14:49.528
Nice meeting you, Brenda.

14:49.706 --> 14:53.074
Hey, aren't you guys bummed
that you got stuck here?

14:53.751 --> 14:57.618
Oh, yeah.
Aren't you bummed, honey?

14:58.297 --> 15:00.254
Devastated.

15:10.350 --> 15:11.381
What a jerk.

15:11.560 --> 15:13.184
Who does this country hick
think he is?

15:13.353 --> 15:14.728
l think he said he was the owner.

15:14.896 --> 15:17.683
Oh, yeah? Well, he doesn't know
diddly about running a business.

15:17.857 --> 15:20.561
Why else wouldn't he sell me
a six-pack at twice the price?

15:20.735 --> 15:23.023
Because you're underage?

15:26.782 --> 15:28.489
Time for plan B.

15:28.659 --> 15:30.947
The front man.

15:32.955 --> 15:34.746
Excuse me, folks.

15:34.915 --> 15:38.366
l was wondering if maybe
you could help me out of a jam.

15:39.085 --> 15:42.453
They'll never go for it.
They're, like, grandparents.

15:42.630 --> 15:45.037
Steve knows what he's doing.

15:45.466 --> 15:46.497
That was quick.

15:46.676 --> 15:47.838
We're in.

15:48.011 --> 15:49.042
How?

15:49.220 --> 15:51.177
Well, l just turned on the charm,

15:51.347 --> 15:54.347
told him he could keep the change
from the 50.

16:08.655 --> 16:12.272
Do you have any 7 s?

16:13.993 --> 16:15.950
Go fish.

16:18.706 --> 16:20.698
Picked a seven.
That's another book.

16:23.002 --> 16:24.626
No, no, no, move that log over.

16:26.046 --> 16:27.125
No, the one in front.

16:27.298 --> 16:29.207
Andrea, l know how to build a fire,
all right?

16:29.425 --> 16:30.883
Well, so far, l don't see any.

16:31.093 --> 16:33.583
Why don't you add
some newspaper?

16:33.804 --> 16:35.298
Andrea, please.

16:35.472 --> 16:37.594
How many fires have you built
in your lifetime?

16:37.807 --> 16:39.598
l've built a fire before, Brandon.

16:39.809 --> 16:42.560
Well, l've built many fires,
possibly hundreds of fires.

16:42.770 --> 16:44.477
- Excuse me.
- Probably thousands of fires.

16:44.647 --> 16:46.473
The problem is we don't have
any dry wood.

16:46.649 --> 16:48.724
Well, young fire starter,
why don't you go get some

16:48.901 --> 16:51.438
from the newlyweds next door?
l mean, they have plenty.

16:52.113 --> 16:55.446
Well, why didn't you say so?
Come on.

16:56.867 --> 16:58.574
You can't just barge in
on their honeymoon.

16:58.744 --> 17:00.403
We're not gonna barge.
We'll knock first.

17:00.579 --> 17:01.610
Brandon.

17:01.788 --> 17:05.239
lf we don't get some heat in here,
we're all gonna die from hypothermia.

17:19.680 --> 17:21.257
Hi, sorry, we don't mean
to bother you.

17:21.432 --> 17:22.890
On this night, of all nights.

17:23.058 --> 17:26.011
But do you have any dry firewood
you could spare?

17:26.228 --> 17:29.347
- Well, you know--
- Oh, sure, come on in.

17:32.442 --> 17:34.233
Thanks.

17:35.028 --> 17:38.194
Well, looks like you got
the deluxe cabin.

17:38.365 --> 17:40.274
l bet you even have hot water, huh?

17:40.492 --> 17:42.567
Neil was about to make a toast.
Will you join us?

17:42.744 --> 17:43.775
Oh, honey, l--

17:43.953 --> 17:47.368
We really don't want to intrude.

17:47.582 --> 17:49.373
Oh, you poor things.

17:49.542 --> 17:51.415
How about some hot chocolate?

17:51.585 --> 17:52.783
Oh, babe, l--

17:56.882 --> 17:58.506
Cheers.

18:08.351 --> 18:10.888
Hey, Steve,
isn't that your couple over there?

18:11.062 --> 18:13.896
David, they haven't come out yet.
We've been here the whole time.

18:14.065 --> 18:16.140
Maybe they snuck out the back?

18:23.240 --> 18:25.362
Hey, where the hell are you going?

18:25.534 --> 18:28.321
You got my $50!

18:37.212 --> 18:39.251
So even though we knew each other
in high school,

18:39.422 --> 18:42.173
we were just friends,
acquaintances, really.

18:42.383 --> 18:44.920
But when l bumped into Neil
in Cambridge--

18:45.136 --> 18:47.757
- You went to Harvard?
- B.U.

18:47.930 --> 18:51.014
- Alison's the brain, not me.
- Stop, l am not.

18:51.183 --> 18:53.009
Anyway, something clicked,

18:53.185 --> 18:55.758
and we knew we were meant
to be together.

18:55.979 --> 18:58.137
No doubts, huh?
No sneaky little feelings

18:58.315 --> 18:59.643
you were making
a heinous mistake?

18:59.816 --> 19:00.847
- Brandon.
- What?

19:01.026 --> 19:04.525
No, l understand what he means.
How can you be sure it'll last forever?

19:04.738 --> 19:06.018
You can't.

19:06.197 --> 19:08.485
You've just gotta go
with your gut instinct.

19:08.658 --> 19:10.401
What feels right.

19:10.577 --> 19:11.608
Don't you think so, honey?

19:11.786 --> 19:12.865
Absolutely.

19:13.037 --> 19:14.614
Maybe we should demonstrate.

19:14.831 --> 19:15.910
Honey.

19:16.540 --> 19:18.283
Can l get you
some more hot chocolate?

19:18.501 --> 19:22.118
No, actually,
we're expected back next door.

19:23.714 --> 19:26.880
Oh, right. Right.

19:34.724 --> 19:37.297
Thanks for the wood--

19:39.062 --> 19:41.932
l swear, it was like
they were con artists or something.

19:42.148 --> 19:43.725
And you were
the innocent victim, right?

19:43.900 --> 19:47.149
- Hey, l hate to say l told you so, but--
- No, hey, go ahead, l'm a jerk.

19:47.361 --> 19:48.938
Come on, l wouldn't go that far.

19:49.155 --> 19:50.435
l would.

19:51.240 --> 19:52.698
l even forgot to get food.

19:53.325 --> 19:54.487
lt's okay.

19:54.660 --> 19:57.447
l'm developing a taste
for soggy cheese puffs.

19:57.663 --> 19:59.489
Man, l can't wait till l'm 21 .

19:59.706 --> 20:02.659
Why, so you can buy beer?
Big deal.

20:02.876 --> 20:04.251
Don't you wish you were older?

20:04.419 --> 20:08.250
Sometimes, but l'm really not in a rush
to be out on my own anymore.

20:08.464 --> 20:10.290
lt's gotta be better
than where we're at now.

20:10.466 --> 20:13.170
Everyone saying you can't do
something because you're too young.

20:13.344 --> 20:14.838
Or you can't dance in this club.

20:15.012 --> 20:16.589
Or you can't watch this movie.

20:16.806 --> 20:17.837
Can't vote in an election,

20:18.015 --> 20:20.054
even though you might know more
than your parents.

20:20.267 --> 20:21.677
Who don't vote anyway.

20:21.894 --> 20:22.925
Well, my parents vote.

20:23.103 --> 20:25.428
- Yeah, but they're different.
- Very different.

20:26.523 --> 20:29.440
They're the exception. lt's like they've
discovered the meaning of life.

20:29.651 --> 20:32.438
And what is the meaning of life,
oh, Cosmic Steve?

20:35.073 --> 20:36.531
l haven't got a clue.

20:37.158 --> 20:38.189
You said it.

20:38.785 --> 20:40.860
- Oh, like you do?
- Yeah.

20:42.371 --> 20:43.485
lt's love.

20:45.708 --> 20:46.988
Yeah, love.

20:47.209 --> 20:48.703
Love makes the world
go around, right?

20:48.919 --> 20:50.033
She's right.

20:52.714 --> 20:54.706
Well, l can't prove it empirically,

20:54.883 --> 20:58.251
but, l don't know, there seems
to be a heightened awareness

20:58.428 --> 21:03.385
experienced by people in love
that transcends the physical plane.

21:03.600 --> 21:06.055
But it won't buy you dinner
when you're hungry.

21:07.729 --> 21:10.480
So, what are you trying to say?
That life is just about money?

21:10.690 --> 21:13.975
Survival. That's it. Getting by.

21:14.193 --> 21:16.315
How romantic.

21:16.529 --> 21:17.939
Love just gets in the way.

21:18.155 --> 21:19.779
Confuses people.

21:19.990 --> 21:21.697
Makes them scattered.

21:23.243 --> 21:25.615
l don't think those newlyweds
next door would agree.

21:25.787 --> 21:27.862
l mean, they seemed
pretty focused to me.

21:29.749 --> 21:32.418
Yeah, focused on a horizontal plane.

21:34.295 --> 21:35.409
You're so immature.

21:35.630 --> 21:37.456
No, wait, wait, Andrea,
so, what's your point?

21:37.632 --> 21:40.419
lf you're not in love,
you're somewhat a lesser specie?

21:40.635 --> 21:43.042
Look, all she's trying to say
is that Alison and Neil

21:43.220 --> 21:46.090
are able to tune out the rain and cold
and be at one with each other.

21:46.307 --> 21:48.264
And each and every one of us
would be lucky

21:48.475 --> 21:50.633
if we could find someone
like that to rely on.

21:52.813 --> 21:53.844
Excuse me.

21:58.318 --> 21:59.977
Alison, what's wrong?

22:00.153 --> 22:01.730
ls something wrong with Neil?

22:01.905 --> 22:04.193
Yes, he's a stupid idiot.

22:06.784 --> 22:09.868
l don't want to impose
but do you guys have room

22:10.037 --> 22:12.076
for one more in here tonight?

22:29.639 --> 22:32.723
Divorce? Don't you think
that's a little drastic?

22:32.892 --> 22:34.220
Maybe you're right.

22:34.394 --> 22:35.769
We'll get an annulment.

22:35.978 --> 22:37.436
Oh, God.

22:37.605 --> 22:39.811
Does Neil feel the same way?

22:40.024 --> 22:43.357
Who cares?
He's a fool and l hate his guts.

22:43.569 --> 22:46.902
The transcendence of love
has again been transcended.

22:47.072 --> 22:49.194
So much for your theory, ladies.

22:49.408 --> 22:53.903
Alison, l don't understand,
l mean, what went wrong?

22:54.079 --> 22:55.786
The bastard got me pregnant.

22:55.997 --> 22:58.203
So? He married you, didn't he?

22:58.416 --> 23:00.040
Steve, shut up.

23:00.251 --> 23:03.038
l didn't know l was pregnant
before last week.

23:03.254 --> 23:04.712
l was planning to tell him tonight,

23:04.881 --> 23:07.917
until l found out he doesn't ever
wanna have children.

23:08.134 --> 23:09.676
This is great.
We don't even need a TV.

23:09.844 --> 23:12.251
We have Days of our Lives
right here, in the flesh.

23:12.471 --> 23:16.717
Well, actually, it's a little more
like Young and the Restless.

23:22.856 --> 23:25.181
Hi, is my wife here, by any chance?

23:25.358 --> 23:26.733
Oh, hello, Ricky, come on in.

23:26.901 --> 23:29.142
Lucy is talking to Ethel
right over there.

23:29.320 --> 23:30.778
Alison, Alison...

23:30.947 --> 23:33.900
Excuse me,
l have to use the restroom.

23:34.075 --> 23:35.782
What did l do?

23:35.993 --> 23:37.652
Man's eternal question.

23:37.870 --> 23:38.901
You don't know?

23:39.080 --> 23:41.749
We were just talking
and...she blew up on me.

23:41.916 --> 23:45.000
You would've thought l told her l'd
slept with her best friend or something.

23:45.169 --> 23:47.624
No, it's not that at all, you see,
she's upset because--

23:47.796 --> 23:51.247
David, l think we should let Alison
discuss this with him.

23:51.466 --> 23:54.669
- Discuss what with him?
- lt's kind of personal.

23:54.886 --> 23:58.385
So she told you guys?

23:58.556 --> 24:00.963
l gotta get this on film.

24:02.935 --> 24:05.141
l don't get it. l just don't get this.

24:05.354 --> 24:07.346
Whatever you do,
don't go begging for forgiveness.

24:07.523 --> 24:09.230
l hate to see a grown man grovel.

24:09.442 --> 24:11.351
Hey, why should l?
l didn't do anything wrong.

24:11.569 --> 24:13.276
Absolutely, so stick to your guns.

24:13.487 --> 24:15.479
l agree. You gotta hang tough
on this one, buddy.

24:15.656 --> 24:18.111
Brandon, how can you say that?
You know what the problem is.

24:18.283 --> 24:21.153
That's exactly my point.
How come we know and he doesn't?

24:21.328 --> 24:22.359
Really?

24:22.537 --> 24:24.944
So obviously, there is a small
communication breakdown

24:25.123 --> 24:26.914
on her side, don't you think?

24:29.544 --> 24:31.951
Oh, Alison, honey,
can we go now, please?

24:32.171 --> 24:34.661
Will someone please tell him
that he can go whenever he likes?

24:34.841 --> 24:35.872
Oh, come on, Allie.

24:36.050 --> 24:38.422
Don't you think it would be better
to talk things out?

24:38.636 --> 24:39.667
Thank you.

24:39.845 --> 24:42.300
l think you said it all before.

24:42.473 --> 24:44.264
What? What did l say?

24:44.475 --> 24:46.847
Why are you making me do this
in front of strangers?

24:47.060 --> 24:49.729
Why not? You're as much a stranger
to me as they are.

24:49.938 --> 24:51.977
Sorry, could you guys
get a little closer together?

24:52.190 --> 24:53.518
l can't get you both in the shot.

24:53.692 --> 24:55.980
Do you mind?

24:56.152 --> 24:57.943
Excuse me.

24:58.112 --> 25:03.106
Allie, honey, at the risk of sounding
like a sexist pig, l have to ask.

25:03.284 --> 25:04.694
ls it that time of the month?

25:09.665 --> 25:12.452
Look, Neil, considering
Alison's frame of mind,

25:12.626 --> 25:17.252
l think that you should let her
stay where she is for the time being.

25:17.422 --> 25:20.790
Great, now l'm getting marital
counselling from the teenagers.

25:22.010 --> 25:24.465
There he goes
with that you're-too-young mentality.

25:24.679 --> 25:25.710
lt never fails.

25:25.889 --> 25:28.593
Well, what do you know about it?
Have you ever been married before?

25:28.766 --> 25:31.138
No, but a lot of us
have been through a divorce.

25:31.352 --> 25:34.720
- Two divorces.
- And a trial separation.

25:34.897 --> 25:38.100
And since we've been through it,
we can tell you, it's no fun.

25:38.901 --> 25:41.854
Well, hey, l don't want a divorce.

25:42.029 --> 25:44.566
Tell it to her, if she ever comes out
of the bathroom again.

25:45.032 --> 25:46.490
Yeah. Take a seat.

25:59.337 --> 26:02.670
So anybody know
any good divorce songs?

26:03.466 --> 26:05.043
What?

26:05.760 --> 26:07.088
Are all your parents divorced?

26:07.261 --> 26:09.300
Well, no, mine aren't, but...

26:09.471 --> 26:14.132
Mine are, his are, his are,
hers aren't, theirs aren't, and his are.

26:15.644 --> 26:17.138
l can hardly remember what it's like

26:17.312 --> 26:19.470
to have my mom and dad
both living in the same house.

26:21.316 --> 26:22.774
How old were you
when they split up?

26:23.902 --> 26:25.894
l was 3 and a half.

26:26.070 --> 26:27.861
l was 5.

26:29.282 --> 26:31.440
How old were you, Dylan?
About 6, right?

26:31.617 --> 26:32.648
So? No big deal.

26:32.827 --> 26:35.946
l mean, better to split up than spend
the rest of your life fighting.

26:36.789 --> 26:39.161
Well, it was a big deal to me.

26:39.375 --> 26:40.869
When l was young l can remember,

26:41.043 --> 26:44.079
whenever l'd meet a new friend
whose parents were divorced,

26:44.254 --> 26:47.871
l'd always think,
''Hey, she's a nice girl.

26:48.049 --> 26:49.958
lt's not her fault
that her dad moved out.''

26:50.176 --> 26:53.342
l guess l kind of reassured myself
that it wasn't my fault.

26:53.513 --> 26:55.007
l know.

26:55.223 --> 26:57.298
l used to think
that if l hadn't made too much noise

26:57.475 --> 27:00.179
so early in the morning,
maybe things could've been different.

27:00.353 --> 27:03.140
Well, l know l didn't cause my parents
to split up.

27:03.314 --> 27:04.891
l could see it coming.

27:05.107 --> 27:06.731
That's because you were 1 4.

27:06.942 --> 27:09.859
No, it's because my dad
became a jerk.

27:10.070 --> 27:12.395
David, it's not that simple.

27:12.573 --> 27:15.573
Well, you know what they say.
lt takes two to tangle.

27:15.784 --> 27:18.239
lt's tango. lt takes two to tango.

27:19.579 --> 27:21.488
My mom was pretty patient
with him.

27:21.664 --> 27:26.041
But she started getting tired
of waiting for his midlife crisis to end.

27:26.252 --> 27:29.834
Hey, guys, l know divorce
is no picnic for kids.

27:30.047 --> 27:34.210
But we don't have any kids,
and we don't plan on having any either.

27:34.427 --> 27:36.384
See? There you go.

27:37.513 --> 27:40.003
ls that what this is all about?

27:41.141 --> 27:42.421
Honey, you want kids?

27:43.268 --> 27:46.304
Alison, you told me they didn't fit in
to your lifestyle.

27:46.480 --> 27:47.938
l was single then.

27:48.148 --> 27:49.725
You told me your firm
didn't look kindly

27:49.899 --> 27:51.606
on associates
who took maternity leave.

27:51.818 --> 27:54.652
So? l can find another firm.

27:54.821 --> 27:56.480
You told me you loved kids.

27:56.656 --> 27:58.814
Yeah, other people's.

27:59.033 --> 28:02.448
But you're always raving
about your nieces and your nephews--

28:02.661 --> 28:05.780
Whom l love very much,
particularly when they all go home.

28:05.998 --> 28:07.907
Does that suddenly
make me a bad person?

28:08.751 --> 28:09.782
No.

28:10.794 --> 28:13.960
it just makes you a bad father-to-be.

28:14.172 --> 28:15.915
Honey...

28:18.218 --> 28:19.249
Are you kidding me?

28:20.595 --> 28:22.302
Oh, my God.

28:22.514 --> 28:24.305
l don't see him jumping for joy.

28:24.515 --> 28:29.757
Alison, honey, you told me
that you weren't able to get pregnant.

28:29.979 --> 28:32.434
Apparently, a misdiagnosis.

28:33.691 --> 28:35.398
Oh, my God.

28:35.609 --> 28:36.640
l've had it. Enough.

28:36.819 --> 28:39.356
l mean, if you want to sit around here
and play ''Dear Abby,''

28:39.530 --> 28:41.985
knock yourselves out, l'm history.

28:42.199 --> 28:44.487
Neil, you don't mind
if l use your cabin do you,

28:44.659 --> 28:46.900
since you're not
gonna be needing it at the moment?

28:47.078 --> 28:48.453
Oh, yeah, fine, fine.

28:54.210 --> 28:57.246
What is the matter with Dylan?
He's so antisocial.

28:57.463 --> 29:00.333
Well, we're not exactly
having a party.

29:20.443 --> 29:22.601
Mind if l join you?

29:23.112 --> 29:25.567
l don't know why you'd want to.

29:27.200 --> 29:29.488
Dylan, what's wrong with you?

29:30.369 --> 29:32.610
l've never seen you like this.

29:32.788 --> 29:35.575
l'm just not into psychodrama.
lt's not my scene.

29:36.250 --> 29:38.740
Yeah, how awful to fight
on your wedding night.

29:38.961 --> 29:41.748
Serves them right for getting married
in the first place.

29:41.963 --> 29:44.169
Just because your parents
didn't make it together

29:44.341 --> 29:46.000
doesn't mean that every couple
is doomed.

29:46.217 --> 29:49.087
Yeah, right. Whatever you say.

29:49.762 --> 29:51.304
l know you're having a hard time--

29:51.472 --> 29:54.508
But what?
What do you know, Bren?

29:54.684 --> 29:58.301
You got a nice home,
a secure family.

29:58.479 --> 30:03.187
My mom is a Looney Tune
and my dad is in jail for God's sake.

30:03.400 --> 30:05.309
l know.

30:05.486 --> 30:07.145
l can't even imagine
how that must feel.

30:07.321 --> 30:09.313
That's right. You can't.

30:09.531 --> 30:10.811
You can't even imagine it.

30:10.991 --> 30:14.324
So who are you to come down on me
about my negative attitude?

30:14.536 --> 30:16.243
Dylan.

30:17.330 --> 30:19.702
l know you got a bum deal,

30:19.874 --> 30:22.080
but can't you look
at what you have that is good?

30:22.251 --> 30:23.745
Like what?

30:23.920 --> 30:25.663
Like your friends.

30:26.005 --> 30:28.377
Brandon loves you,
all the guys think you're totally cool.

30:28.549 --> 30:30.624
Every girl l know would love
to go out with you--

30:30.801 --> 30:34.050
Every girl, but one.

30:35.222 --> 30:38.092
l thought we both decided that it
would be better to see other people.

30:38.308 --> 30:41.012
Yeah, better for you.

30:41.770 --> 30:44.889
Can't you just accept the fact
that l care about you,

30:45.065 --> 30:47.306
and that l want to help you
and stop twisting it around?

30:47.525 --> 30:51.107
Oh, l forgot. You care about me,
but l'm just too intense.

30:54.156 --> 30:56.444
Hi, guys, we're back.

30:56.659 --> 30:57.939
And still married.

30:58.160 --> 31:00.117
So you guys
worked everything out, huh?

31:00.329 --> 31:03.946
Yeah, see, we both feel--
Now stop me if l'm wrong, honey.

31:04.124 --> 31:06.449
--that even though we didn't plan
on having children,

31:06.627 --> 31:08.286
well, we've got nine months
for the idea

31:08.462 --> 31:10.288
to grow on us, so to speak.

31:10.505 --> 31:12.414
l'm already getting used to it.

31:12.632 --> 31:14.423
Hopefully by then, Neil will be too.

31:14.968 --> 31:15.999
What if he isn't?

31:16.636 --> 31:18.842
Oh, l probably will be.

31:19.055 --> 31:21.012
But you don't know, Neil.

31:23.476 --> 31:26.145
Well, then, that'll just
be our problem, won't it?

31:26.354 --> 31:29.805
No, it'll be that kid's problem who
didn't ask to be born in the first place.

31:30.024 --> 31:32.479
- Dylan--
- Dylan, nobody asks to be born.

31:32.651 --> 31:35.320
That's right, that's why you better
make sure you want this baby,

31:35.487 --> 31:37.111
or else, give it to someone
who does.

31:37.322 --> 31:39.943
You make a lot of assumptions
for someone who doesn't know us.

31:40.158 --> 31:41.486
l know what it's like to grow up

31:41.660 --> 31:43.652
being constantly reminded
that you are a mistake.

31:43.828 --> 31:46.200
And if you're not prepared
to love that baby or give it up,

31:46.372 --> 31:48.364
you might as well
have an abortion right now.

31:48.583 --> 31:49.827
Dylan, stop it.

31:51.127 --> 31:54.127
Fine, it's stopped.

32:09.269 --> 32:10.431
How was the honeymoon suite?

32:10.604 --> 32:12.762
l don't want to talk about it.

32:13.982 --> 32:16.140
Hey, Bren, is everything okay?
Where's Dylan?

32:16.317 --> 32:17.941
He stalked off.

32:18.111 --> 32:22.060
He'll be okay. The van's open.
He can sleep in there.

33:25.633 --> 33:27.340
McKay!

33:27.509 --> 33:29.881
Rise and shine, Jones!

33:51.032 --> 33:52.691
Morning.

33:54.160 --> 33:55.951
Morning.

33:56.120 --> 33:58.361
Did you sleep last night?

33:58.539 --> 34:01.824
Not a whole lot. How about you?

34:02.000 --> 34:03.909
l slept great.

34:05.337 --> 34:07.376
l guess you needed
to be alone.

34:08.840 --> 34:11.330
l guess l needed a drink.

34:13.678 --> 34:15.337
Found them
in the honeymoon cabin.

34:18.558 --> 34:20.467
A ''drink'' drink.

34:22.812 --> 34:24.804
Oh, man.

34:24.980 --> 34:28.099
l got mine, though.
l puked my guts out.

34:28.317 --> 34:30.309
From these little bottles?

34:30.485 --> 34:33.355
lt wasn't the alcohol, man.

34:33.947 --> 34:35.145
lt was everything.

34:40.911 --> 34:43.070
But you were clean for so long.

34:43.246 --> 34:44.277
Yeah, so chalk it up

34:44.456 --> 34:48.324
to the ever-growing list
of failures.

34:51.297 --> 34:53.170
So how are you feeling now?

34:53.340 --> 34:54.964
Now?

34:55.592 --> 34:57.714
Yeah, now.

34:57.886 --> 34:59.428
Now that the sun is shining again,

34:59.596 --> 35:03.095
and the air smells fresh,
and the birdies are chirping.

35:03.975 --> 35:09.135
Now l feel...okay.

35:09.772 --> 35:11.314
Just okay?

35:11.482 --> 35:13.439
You made it through last night,
didn't you?

35:13.609 --> 35:15.850
l'm still here.

35:16.028 --> 35:18.779
You battled your demons, man,
and you won.

35:18.948 --> 35:21.521
l didn't win, Brandon.

35:24.203 --> 35:27.654
Okay, so we'll call it a tie then.

35:27.873 --> 35:30.079
But you gotta stop
beating yourself up.

35:30.292 --> 35:31.702
So who do l beat up?

35:31.877 --> 35:34.664
My dad? My mom?

35:36.756 --> 35:38.250
l know it's a real sore spot for you,

35:38.424 --> 35:42.587
but your mom really let you down
this weekend, didn't she?

35:42.804 --> 35:45.045
lt's so damn old, man.

35:45.223 --> 35:47.381
lt's an old story with me.
l should've seen it coming.

35:47.558 --> 35:49.965
l should never let my guard down.

35:51.562 --> 35:53.056
Did you ever tell her how you feel?

35:53.230 --> 35:55.518
At this point, what good would it do?

35:55.732 --> 35:58.935
l don't know,
l mean, l'm not a shrink,

35:59.111 --> 36:03.606
but it seems to me that your parents
should be helping you.

36:03.782 --> 36:06.403
Supporting you, loving you.
That's their job.

36:07.285 --> 36:10.451
l just gotta stop expecting anything.

36:10.622 --> 36:12.329
lt's better to know where you stand.

36:13.332 --> 36:15.822
Well, l know
where you're standing now, bud.

36:16.627 --> 36:19.461
You're standing next to me, we should
take advantage of the situation,

36:19.672 --> 36:21.664
go find ourselves a trail
and take a hike

36:21.840 --> 36:24.793
through this righteously
beautiful countryside.

36:24.968 --> 36:26.082
What do you say?

36:30.348 --> 36:33.218
lt's a brand-new morning here
at Huck-a-Muck Lodge,

36:33.435 --> 36:36.684
and as you can see, some campers
tend to be less bright-eyed

36:36.855 --> 36:38.894
and bushy-tailed than others.

36:39.065 --> 36:42.647
We've heard tell of some wild boar
living in these parts.

36:42.819 --> 36:45.274
Give me a break, okay?

36:45.863 --> 36:49.278
Oh, isn't it a little early
for this, David?

36:49.450 --> 36:51.857
David, get out!

36:53.036 --> 36:56.451
Haven't you people ever heard
of cinema verite?

36:58.625 --> 37:00.202
Steve, what are you doing?

37:00.377 --> 37:01.456
Leave me alone.

37:01.628 --> 37:03.834
He's clearing his sinuses,
or so he claims.

37:04.005 --> 37:05.084
lt's true.

37:05.256 --> 37:07.082
l'm starving.

37:07.258 --> 37:08.456
Let's order room service.

37:08.635 --> 37:09.666
Oh, that'd be great.

37:09.844 --> 37:11.503
l'll have bacon and eggs
and French toast,

37:11.679 --> 37:13.552
and a basket of sweet rolls.

37:13.723 --> 37:14.967
Make it two.

37:15.141 --> 37:16.599
Why am l eating this?

37:16.767 --> 37:18.593
Well, Brenda, l think there's
some cheese left

37:18.769 --> 37:20.642
in the mousetrap.

37:23.816 --> 37:26.650
God, it's gorgeous out.

37:28.153 --> 37:30.062
Where's Brandon?

37:30.739 --> 37:33.312
l don't know. Where's the van?

37:40.790 --> 37:43.790
- Yeah, now this is more like it.
- You feel better?

37:43.959 --> 37:45.121
l don't know what it is, man.

37:45.294 --> 37:47.867
Sometimes, l lose faith
in myself, you know?

37:48.464 --> 37:50.006
Yep.

38:04.479 --> 38:05.510
You all right, man?

38:05.688 --> 38:08.641
Yeah, it's okay.

38:08.816 --> 38:10.559
Come on, let's go.

38:11.402 --> 38:13.975
l wish l had my hiking boots.

38:21.745 --> 38:24.532
Let's go up to that peak up there,
the view's gotta be incredible.

38:24.748 --> 38:26.028
Yeah.

39:04.702 --> 39:07.027
You know, it's like, sometimes,
l try to imagine my future

39:07.205 --> 39:09.280
and l just can't see anything.

39:09.457 --> 39:11.782
l try not to look too far ahead.

39:11.959 --> 39:14.959
You know what they say.
The future is now.

39:15.921 --> 39:17.712
Man, this is beautiful.

39:21.468 --> 39:22.499
Brandon!

39:24.846 --> 39:26.719
Brandon!

39:36.274 --> 39:38.231
Brandon!

39:38.818 --> 39:40.609
Where you at, man?

39:40.778 --> 39:42.604
Answer me!

39:44.031 --> 39:46.070
- Brandon.
- Dylan, get back, man.

39:46.241 --> 39:49.028
-The ledge is gonna go.
- lt's all right, man.

39:49.203 --> 39:50.282
Grab my hand!

39:50.495 --> 39:52.202
l can't, man, l can't let go.

39:56.501 --> 39:59.750
Come on, man, just grab it, let's go.

39:59.963 --> 40:01.243
You gotta try.

40:05.885 --> 40:07.676
Come on.

40:11.891 --> 40:14.216
Don't look down, don't look down!

40:14.393 --> 40:16.266
Look up here, look right here.

40:16.478 --> 40:18.269
Come on.

40:20.565 --> 40:22.189
Come on.

40:25.612 --> 40:27.770
That's it. Stretch, damn it.

40:27.989 --> 40:29.020
Come on.

40:44.505 --> 40:48.122
All right, come on. Up.

41:04.941 --> 41:07.016
Okay, buddy, just a little more.

41:19.454 --> 41:21.363
You all right, man?

41:21.540 --> 41:23.947
Yeah, sure, solid as a rock.

41:24.125 --> 41:26.615
Yeah, tell me about it.

41:28.880 --> 41:31.417
Man, l thought my number was up.

41:32.467 --> 41:35.040
Apparently not, thank God.

41:37.680 --> 41:39.387
Thank you.

41:41.767 --> 41:43.510
You're filthy, you know that?

41:43.686 --> 41:47.434
Yeah, l know.
Can't take me anywhere.

41:55.113 --> 41:57.319
- Any message?
- They haven't called the office.

41:57.490 --> 41:59.565
They said there've
been some rockslides in the area

41:59.742 --> 42:01.022
because of the rain.

42:01.202 --> 42:03.739
But they're probably fine, right?

42:03.913 --> 42:05.988
Yeah, well, if they don't get here soon,

42:06.165 --> 42:08.406
l think l'm gonna die from malnutrition.

42:11.962 --> 42:14.666
All right, here they are.

42:15.257 --> 42:16.751
The van doesn't have
a scratch on it.

42:26.267 --> 42:27.298
Where have you guys been?

42:27.477 --> 42:29.718
- Did you guys get in an accident?
- Did you get mugged?

42:29.896 --> 42:31.639
Did you get any food?
What's going on?

42:31.814 --> 42:34.055
All of the above
and none of the above.

42:34.233 --> 42:36.391
Brandon, what happened?

42:36.569 --> 42:38.727
Nothing, we were just hanging out.

42:38.946 --> 42:41.899
- Well, you lost a shoe.
- Well, at least l still have my foot.

42:42.116 --> 42:43.907
Two feet. And two arms.

42:44.076 --> 42:45.867
True, two arms.

42:46.036 --> 42:47.150
- And a head.
- And a head.

42:48.747 --> 42:49.778
But what--?

42:49.956 --> 42:51.450
l'll explain it to you later, okay?

42:51.666 --> 42:54.287
Guys, come on. What do you say
we get out of here already, huh?

42:54.836 --> 42:57.291
- All right, good.
- Let's go. Let's go.

42:58.047 --> 42:59.541
Dylan.

42:59.716 --> 43:01.423
- l--
- l know.

43:01.592 --> 43:04.509
Listen, about last night--

43:04.679 --> 43:06.754
Oh, hey, forget it.

43:06.931 --> 43:09.303
Although you did have me scared
for a little while there.

43:09.475 --> 43:13.258
Yeah, me too, babe, me too.

43:13.729 --> 43:16.932
l knew you'd be okay
since Brandon was with you.

43:17.107 --> 43:18.814
Yeah.

43:33.247 --> 43:34.741
Hey.

43:36.709 --> 43:39.034
l'm sorry if l freaked you guys out
last night.

43:39.253 --> 43:41.826
No, don't apologise, really.

43:42.005 --> 43:43.547
You gave us a lot to think about.

43:44.466 --> 43:46.008
Good luck with your baby.

43:46.176 --> 43:49.959
And hey, if it's a boy,
you could name it Dylan.

43:51.431 --> 43:53.968
Well, he'd be in some
good company.

43:54.475 --> 43:57.428
- Take it easy.
- Have a safe trip.

44:00.940 --> 44:02.897
Oh, we are jamming now.

44:03.067 --> 44:04.395
Yosemite, here we come.

44:04.568 --> 44:06.359
We're stopping
for breakfast first, right?

44:06.529 --> 44:07.560
Absolutely.

44:07.738 --> 44:09.944
Good, otherwise,
l was gonna eat this van.

44:10.115 --> 44:12.605
You guys, this is finally starting
to feel like a vacation.

44:12.784 --> 44:14.657
Yeah, well, it started off rocky there
at first

44:14.828 --> 44:17.662
but whenever you leave L.A.,
it takes a few days to unwind.

44:18.373 --> 44:19.867
Not for me.

44:25.838 --> 44:27.296
Hey.

44:27.465 --> 44:29.338
Are you okay?

44:29.508 --> 44:31.215
Yeah.

44:32.011 --> 44:34.680
Actually, l'm incredibly okay.

44:34.847 --> 44:36.389
Come here.

44:40.102 --> 44:43.719
All right, you guys,
let's grab those bags and dangle.

44:44.856 --> 44:46.398
- Dangle?
- How about a little of this.

44:46.566 --> 44:48.475
Dangle it.
