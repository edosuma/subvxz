01:25.162 --> 01:26.429
Welcome to Moscow.

01:27.164 --> 01:28.698
Please enjoy your stay.

01:39.410 --> 01:42.345
- The Boss is expecting you.
- Right this way.

01:46.784 --> 01:48.284
Showtime.

01:50.888 --> 01:52.889
'Kay, Gerry. We have no visuals inside.

01:52.891 --> 01:54.290
It's on you now.

02:22.620 --> 02:24.220
Welcome.

02:24.222 --> 02:25.455
<i>Sala'am aleikum.</i>

02:26.590 --> 02:27.657
Take a seat.

02:34.565 --> 02:37.534
You've traveled a long way.
Please. I insist.

02:46.610 --> 02:50.180
You'll have to forgive the
less-than-tasteful decor.

02:50.182 --> 02:54.284
The fancy hotels are all booked
for the anti-terrorism summit.

03:00.791 --> 03:01.858
Is that it?

03:04.195 --> 03:05.195
All of it?

03:14.238 --> 03:16.472
Gentlemen, please.

03:16.474 --> 03:17.907
Please.

03:19.243 --> 03:20.476
We're all friends here.

03:25.382 --> 03:26.316
Hmm?

03:29.820 --> 03:31.788
I understand you are anxious, here,

03:32.556 --> 03:34.257
in your enemy's territory.

03:34.259 --> 03:37.260
But I assure you that is
precisely why you are safe.

03:37.262 --> 03:41.331
No one would dream of looking for you
here, right under their noses. Hmm?

03:50.808 --> 03:53.476
Of course mistrust is healthy

03:53.478 --> 03:56.446
when conducting these
sorts of transactions,

03:56.448 --> 03:57.780
but rest assured, gentlemen,

03:58.549 --> 04:00.250
nobody wants to die today.

04:01.485 --> 04:03.786
We are honest criminals.

04:14.698 --> 04:16.766
Here it comes.

04:16.767 --> 04:19.502
I'll show you mine, if you show me yours.

04:39.957 --> 04:40.957
Um-hmm.

04:52.903 --> 04:53.970
You're happy?

04:57.841 --> 04:58.875
Yes.

05:01.478 --> 05:03.513
I'll take your word for it.

05:03.515 --> 05:05.048
Don't forget this.

05:05.916 --> 05:08.651
Without it, she's useless.

05:11.422 --> 05:14.390
What is this? -We celebrate
our new partnership.

05:15.092 --> 05:16.526
There is no need for this.

05:18.629 --> 05:19.929
I insist.

05:38.048 --> 05:39.015
Ah.

05:48.659 --> 05:50.760
Ah.

05:50.762 --> 05:53.096
What's going on? -I don't know.
Something's not right.

05:53.098 --> 05:54.530
He should've confirmed by now.

05:55.666 --> 05:56.833
We need to go in.

05:56.835 --> 05:58.501
We're not supposed to be engaging at all.

05:58.503 --> 05:59.669
Track and confirm only.

06:03.907 --> 06:06.642
- Our business is concluded.
- Of course.

06:09.614 --> 06:10.880
What is it?

06:23.694 --> 06:25.027
What the hell just happened?

06:25.029 --> 06:26.062
I'm not sure.

06:35.806 --> 06:36.873
Sleep well, chaps.

06:48.787 --> 06:49.752
What is that?

06:50.788 --> 06:52.822
A homing beacon's been activated.

06:52.824 --> 06:54.023
What? From where?

06:55.058 --> 06:56.125
From in there.

07:18.715 --> 07:20.917
Now, I know this must look bad.

07:20.919 --> 07:22.852
There's actually a very funny story.

07:26.223 --> 07:27.924
You didn't let me get to the funny part.

07:29.960 --> 07:31.694
That was definitely gunfire.

07:31.696 --> 07:34.197
Agent Cooper, stand down! -You
want to stop me, shoot me.

08:19.576 --> 08:20.843
- Goodbye.
- Wait.

08:22.513 --> 08:24.614
My finger's on the trigger button.

08:24.616 --> 08:27.517
If you shoot me, this whole
place becomes a memory.

08:27.519 --> 08:30.753
Now, lower your weapon and walk away.

08:30.755 --> 08:33.722
- No.
- What do you mean, "no"?

08:33.725 --> 08:35.024
I mean, "no."

08:35.025 --> 08:36.958
I will not lower weapon.

08:36.961 --> 08:39.794
You do understand what will
happen if I push this button?

08:40.130 --> 08:41.097
Um-hmm.

08:43.100 --> 08:45.268
Okay, so just to be clear,
you're perfectly happy for me

08:45.270 --> 08:47.737
to kill us, your friends, your family,
and millions of innocent people,

08:47.739 --> 08:48.671
have I got that right?

08:49.206 --> 08:50.139
<i>Da.</i>

08:52.276 --> 08:54.577
Because button does nothing without key.

08:56.146 --> 08:57.113
That's a good point.

09:12.696 --> 09:13.663
You hit good...

09:14.231 --> 09:15.231
For a lady.

09:32.182 --> 09:33.149
Enough!

09:33.650 --> 09:34.584
Goodbye.

09:35.218 --> 09:36.953
FBI! Drop your weapon!

09:49.800 --> 09:51.334
Agent Cooper?

09:52.970 --> 09:54.103
Agent Cooper, come in.

09:55.238 --> 09:56.172
Nothing.

10:03.747 --> 10:05.348
Who are you and what are you doing here?

10:05.350 --> 10:07.249
Simon Templar. And, at the moment, hiding.

10:11.688 --> 10:14.824
Well, Simon, you're interfering
with a government operation.

10:14.826 --> 10:17.126
Special agent Cooper, FBI.

10:17.128 --> 10:19.061
Since when does the FBI have
jurisdiction in Russia.

10:23.166 --> 10:25.101
It's a joint task force.

10:26.069 --> 10:27.803
- Who's coming?
- Coming?

10:27.805 --> 10:29.071
You set off a homing device on the nuke.

10:29.073 --> 10:30.806
- Who are you trying to contact?
- Interpol.

10:30.808 --> 10:30.806
- Bullshit.
- Look, agent Cooper,

10:30.808 --> 10:34.677
we can sit here with you
continuing to not believe me

10:34.679 --> 10:36.045
and be turned into Swiss cheese

10:36.047 --> 10:38.681
or we can, I don't know, do
something to try and survive.

10:42.720 --> 10:44.186
Wait, wait, wait! What are you doing?

10:46.790 --> 10:47.923
Making the sensible choice.

10:47.925 --> 10:49.792
- Cover me.
- Wait. Stop.

11:06.243 --> 11:08.077
Son of a bitch!

11:16.920 --> 11:19.188
I need some backup in here.

11:27.264 --> 11:29.398
Only ten in clip, rookie.

11:29.400 --> 11:30.900
You want to reload? I wait.

11:35.138 --> 11:37.740
- You're welcome.
- You're under arrest.

11:37.742 --> 11:39.842
- Are you serious?
- Always.

11:39.844 --> 11:42.211
And what's the charge? -I don't know.
I'll think of something.

11:44.816 --> 11:46.015
Agent Cooper?

11:47.017 --> 11:48.317
Agent Cooper, we're in.

11:48.319 --> 11:49.952
Better late than never.

11:49.954 --> 11:52.388
But don't worry. Situation's under control.

11:52.390 --> 11:54.256
We just need to place him under arrest.

11:54.925 --> 11:55.891
Who?

12:08.171 --> 12:09.305
Son of a...

12:20.450 --> 12:21.484
The Saint?

12:27.224 --> 12:29.959
Patricia, perfect timing.

12:29.961 --> 12:31.360
My specialty.

12:31.362 --> 12:33.796
How's your Russian adventure?

12:33.798 --> 12:35.164
Very Russian. Very adventurous.

12:35.166 --> 12:37.333
And, uh...

12:37.335 --> 12:38.501
Not quite over.

12:39.536 --> 12:40.836
Escape route's on your phone.

12:41.304 --> 12:42.304
Right.

12:42.939 --> 12:45.207
Where am I going?

12:45.209 --> 12:47.543
The airport. He'll meet you
in Bucharest tomorrow.

12:47.545 --> 12:50.146
I've got you a charter flight.
Wheels up in an hour.

12:50.148 --> 12:53.549
Ms. Holm, you are as efficient
as you are beautiful.

12:53.551 --> 12:53.549
Ah, thank you as always, darling.

12:53.551 --> 13:00.256
And I must say, the beard does give
you a certain... Sophistication.

13:01.925 --> 13:03.425
Oh? Can't have that.

13:03.427 --> 13:05.828
I should shave it off at
the first opportunity.

13:05.830 --> 13:08.164
Oh, I like you with a little scruff.

13:08.166 --> 13:09.865
I'll take that into consideration.

13:13.370 --> 13:15.137
The united nations - relief agency

13:15.139 --> 13:17.139
has pledged aid to the region,

13:17.141 --> 13:21.510
but the money's been held up over fears
that it simply won't reach those in need.

13:21.512 --> 13:24.113
Meanwhile, president Ezekiel Ibaka

13:24.115 --> 13:29.919
is said to have secured nearly 2.5 billion
dollars in aid from private entities.

13:29.921 --> 13:31.253
The newly elected president,

13:31.255 --> 13:33.255
who promised to stamp out corruption,

13:33.257 --> 13:35.424
personally reached out to
groups around the world

13:35.426 --> 13:37.893
in an effort to keep his
country from falling apart.

13:39.196 --> 13:41.130
My father was a hero.

13:41.598 --> 13:43.299
A warrior.

13:43.301 --> 13:46.235
As inspiring as he was fearsome.

13:46.237 --> 13:50.072
One of the greatest generals
Nigeria has ever known.

13:50.074 --> 13:51.307
He loved his country...

13:53.911 --> 13:56.345
At times, I felt, even
more than he loved me.

13:58.215 --> 14:00.482
It would pain him greatly
to know what I have done.

14:01.852 --> 14:03.552
He was a proud man.

14:03.554 --> 14:06.555
He would never stoop to begging, as I have.

14:06.557 --> 14:10.159
That's not true. Your father
would be very proud of you.

14:10.161 --> 14:12.528
The lengths to which you have gone
to help your people, Mr. president,

14:12.530 --> 14:14.563
will go down in history.

14:14.565 --> 14:19.068
And remember, it takes
courage to ask for help.

14:19.070 --> 14:23.272
The generosity you have shown my
country has been overwhelming,

14:23.274 --> 14:26.575
and it will certainly help the
healing process, but sadly,

14:26.577 --> 14:28.143
it's still not enough.

14:30.313 --> 14:34.884
Did you ever think that 2.5 billion
dollars would not be enough?

14:36.453 --> 14:38.220
Well, that's why I'm here.

14:38.222 --> 14:41.457
I pledge to you, and your
country, all of my talents.

14:41.459 --> 14:43.592
We will make this work. We have to.

14:45.362 --> 14:48.931
Yes, we will.

14:48.933 --> 14:51.901
I don't think I have ever seen
a ring like this before. -Oh.

14:52.535 --> 14:55.170
Well... family heirloom.

14:55.172 --> 14:57.506
It's very dear to me, actually.

14:57.508 --> 15:02.144
It serves as a reminder, of a time long
ago, when the world was very different.

15:02.913 --> 15:04.980
Less complicated.

15:04.982 --> 15:07.549
When good men banded together
to fight for what was right.

15:09.052 --> 15:11.253
It motivates me to this day.

15:11.255 --> 15:13.188
It brought me here, to you.

15:14.357 --> 15:16.625
And I'm incredibly grateful that it did.

15:43.086 --> 15:44.553
All right.

15:44.555 --> 15:46.722
You'll have access to the
bank accounts at midnight.

15:46.724 --> 15:48.958
By 12:01, I want them cleaned out.

15:48.960 --> 15:49.725
Yes, Sir.

16:06.209 --> 16:07.242
Um...

16:08.178 --> 16:09.645
- What is it?
- Sir.

16:11.381 --> 16:12.681
Should we be doing this?

16:14.017 --> 16:17.219
I mean the 2.5 billion isn't blood money.

16:17.221 --> 16:19.254
It's going for aid to people in need.

16:19.256 --> 16:23.292
Now don't start growing a conscience,
Arnie. You haven't had the experience.

16:26.730 --> 16:28.397
He asked you about your ring, didn't he?

16:30.000 --> 16:31.700
It practically sealed the deal.

16:32.535 --> 16:34.069
How did you know he would?

16:35.372 --> 16:37.606
It's a conversation starter.

16:37.608 --> 16:39.775
- What did you tell him?
- The truth.

16:39.777 --> 16:42.111
That it was a family heirloom.

16:42.113 --> 16:44.179
I just didn't tell him it wasn't my family.

16:45.382 --> 16:47.483
I almost gave it to him.

16:48.385 --> 16:50.319
Why?

16:50.321 --> 16:52.755
Because he's pathetic, just
like the man I took it from.

16:54.424 --> 16:57.159
You've kept it all these years,
it must mean something to you.

17:00.096 --> 17:01.063
Here.

17:02.265 --> 17:04.633
It's yours. That's how much it means to me.

17:07.569 --> 17:10.039
All right. Get on with it.
Time's a-wasting.

17:11.141 --> 17:12.241
Yes, Sir.

17:47.777 --> 17:52.381
Simon Templar, you're the
most peculiar thief I know.

17:52.383 --> 17:54.383
Coming from you, I'll take
that as a compliment.

17:55.752 --> 17:56.752
You have the list?

17:59.255 --> 18:00.322
Right here.

18:02.625 --> 18:06.261
Eight hundred thousand to
doctors without borders.

18:06.263 --> 18:09.832
Seven hundred fifty thousand to
migrant assistance. -Um-hmm.

18:09.834 --> 18:13.202
1.5 million to children's hunger fund...

18:13.470 --> 18:14.770
Listen...

18:14.772 --> 18:17.673
You want to give all
this money to children?

18:17.675 --> 18:21.210
Th-they are so little. Maybe
they don't eat so much.

18:23.546 --> 18:25.514
Your money. You're the Boss.

18:25.516 --> 18:28.183
Just make sure the money
gets where it needs to go.

18:29.252 --> 18:31.186
Minus my very little commission.

18:31.188 --> 18:33.188
Minus your rather hefty commission

18:33.190 --> 18:35.591
which several of your competitors
would gladly undercut.

18:36.126 --> 18:37.392
Yes.

18:37.394 --> 18:39.862
But they don't have my good looks.

18:39.864 --> 18:42.364
Or your discretion... Old friend.

19:40.557 --> 19:42.925
And in international news,

19:42.927 --> 19:47.629
2.5 billion dollars earmarked
to aid the nation of Nigeria

19:47.631 --> 19:49.898
has apparently gone missing.

19:49.900 --> 19:53.769
Newly elected president Ezekiel
Ibaka has vowed to find

19:53.771 --> 19:55.871
the missing funds or resign.

20:03.446 --> 20:06.248
Did you watch it? -Yes, it's hardly news.

20:06.250 --> 20:10.352
Just another corrupt dictator stealing
from his people. Plus ca change.

20:10.920 --> 20:12.921
No. I trust him.

20:12.923 --> 20:15.257
I think he's just been
trusting the wrong people.

20:15.259 --> 20:16.758
And you know this because...

20:16.760 --> 20:19.995
A hunch. A little digging
I've been doing on my own.

20:19.997 --> 20:22.364
How very entrepreneurial of you, darling.

20:22.366 --> 20:23.632
Better watch my back or you'll have my job.

20:23.634 --> 20:25.934
No, you can keep it, darling.

20:25.936 --> 20:27.836
I like being the brains of the operation.

20:28.805 --> 20:29.938
Oh, is that what you are?

20:30.873 --> 20:32.341
So what does that make me?

20:32.343 --> 20:33.642
The muscle, love.

20:33.644 --> 20:34.710
You're all muscle.

20:35.380 --> 20:36.279
Now, listen.

20:36.280 --> 20:41.583
I've recently seen the Nigerian
president in the company of this man.

20:41.585 --> 20:42.951
Just sent to your phone.

20:46.556 --> 20:47.489
Who's this?

20:47.491 --> 20:49.424
I don't have a name yet.

20:49.426 --> 20:49.424
But I've run his picture

20:49.426 --> 20:54.363
through every facial recognition
database I could tap into

20:54.365 --> 20:56.331
and the only other time he ever appears

20:56.333 --> 21:00.902
is in an NSA surveillance photo
with Sheik Muhammad Al Khabiri,

21:00.904 --> 21:04.306
a terrorist financier who's now
enjoying a lifelong vacation

21:04.308 --> 21:07.409
in a CIA black prison somewhere.

21:07.411 --> 21:09.544
Something oddly familiar about him.

21:09.546 --> 21:10.646
Lemme guess.

21:10.648 --> 21:12.014
You rowed together at Oxford.

21:15.718 --> 21:17.552
Tell you what. Let's do some more digging.

21:17.554 --> 21:19.821
If you can find some leads
on the missing money,

21:19.823 --> 21:21.490
it's gonna be right up our boulevard.

21:21.492 --> 21:23.792
Yeah. My thoughts exactly. Already on it.

21:27.530 --> 21:30.065
- But, Simon?
- Yes, darling.

21:30.067 --> 21:32.534
I might have been wrong about the beard.

21:32.536 --> 21:35.504
It makes you a little, dare I say...

21:35.506 --> 21:36.805
Older.

21:36.807 --> 21:37.839
Goodbye, darling.

21:48.084 --> 21:54.523
You, gentlemen, were the only ones who
got perfect scores on your exams.

21:58.961 --> 22:01.963
I am most surprised at you, Mr. Templar.

22:01.965 --> 22:06.802
You had perfect grades. You did not
need to steal the answer sheets.

22:06.804 --> 22:08.503
I never looked at the answers, Sir.

22:10.540 --> 22:14.109
And yet you felt compelled to
break into the master's office...

22:14.111 --> 22:16.011
we didn't break in, Sir.

22:19.449 --> 22:21.016
I made an impression of the key.

22:21.551 --> 22:22.884
So you admit it?

22:22.886 --> 22:25.120
There's nothing to admit, Sir.
You caught us.

22:25.122 --> 22:27.823
Which would have never happened
if you'd stuck to the plan.

22:27.825 --> 22:30.625
You were supposed to miss
a few answers on purpose.

22:40.002 --> 22:43.004
Why would you steal an exam paper?

22:43.006 --> 22:45.140
You don't need to cheat. You're a Templar.

22:46.008 --> 22:47.709
You have a responsibility.

22:50.813 --> 22:53.548
I expect you to conduct yourself
in a certain manner in this world.

22:54.851 --> 22:56.084
I didn't cheat.

22:57.453 --> 22:58.687
I just stole.

23:00.690 --> 23:02.858
I appreciate the distinction.

23:03.993 --> 23:05.560
But why, Simon?

23:08.664 --> 23:09.998
I wanted them to like me.

23:11.968 --> 23:16.037
I wanted to be... A part of something.

23:16.039 --> 23:18.874
- You are a part of something.
- A part of what?

23:18.876 --> 23:21.643
A family of rich snobs no one likes?

23:31.921 --> 23:33.455
Do you have any idea how this
family acquired its fortune?

23:38.194 --> 23:39.928
Do you even know what it
is I do for a living?

23:43.566 --> 23:45.033
Well, perhaps it's time you learned.

23:50.540 --> 23:52.007
You've seen this before, haven't you?

23:57.780 --> 24:00.482
That is the symbol of the knights Templar.

24:04.854 --> 24:07.022
Who are the knights Templar?

24:08.658 --> 24:09.925
That is a very interesting question.

24:10.927 --> 24:14.729
See, a long time ago, in 1119,

24:14.731 --> 24:18.033
just after the end of the first crusade...

24:18.035 --> 24:21.036
A small band of knights were
traveling back to their kingdom...

24:43.527 --> 24:45.060
You did good, Coop.

24:45.062 --> 24:47.662
Why don't you take some time off?
You've earned it.

24:47.997 --> 24:48.997
I, uh...

24:50.032 --> 24:51.733
I want to open a new investigation.

24:52.735 --> 24:53.668
What?

25:01.010 --> 25:02.811
Simon Templar... who's that?

25:02.813 --> 25:04.846
They call him "the Saint."

25:04.848 --> 25:08.550
I talked to Brodsky at Interpol as well
as inspector teal over at Scotland yard.

25:08.552 --> 25:10.018
They've been after him for years.

25:10.020 --> 25:11.786
He's an international thief.

25:11.788 --> 25:15.056
He's wanted for money laundering,
computer fraud, smuggling...

25:15.058 --> 25:16.725
- This the guy from Russia?
- Yeah.

25:17.159 --> 25:18.727
Coop, look, uh...

25:20.129 --> 25:22.597
You're the kid genius and all,

25:22.599 --> 25:26.868
but the director feels we went way out
of our comfort zone for you last time.

25:26.870 --> 25:31.239
There's nothing on this guy that involves the
United States, for sure not domestically.

25:31.241 --> 25:35.010
We're the FBI, not the CIA or Interpol.

25:35.012 --> 25:38.046
He compromised an active
anti-terrorism operation,

25:38.048 --> 25:40.115
and we're what? We-we're
gonna let him walk?

25:40.117 --> 25:41.816
He's not our problem.

25:41.818 --> 25:43.151
The bureau won't back you on this.

25:43.153 --> 25:44.252
- No, but you...
- I...

25:45.087 --> 25:46.087
Won't back you.

25:51.561 --> 25:52.894
Speaking of Interpol,

25:52.896 --> 25:54.763
- that ever check out?
- What?

25:54.765 --> 25:57.032
In your report, you said this "Saint"

25:57.034 --> 26:00.335
set off a homing device
alerting Interpol to the nuke.

26:00.337 --> 26:03.939
Did that ever check out? -Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It did. What's your point?

26:03.941 --> 26:07.075
So maybe he wasn't really the
bad guy in the situation.

26:07.077 --> 26:09.911
What about the gold? He took off with
most of the bullion, didn't he or what?

26:09.913 --> 26:11.346
What, you think he gave it to charity?

26:12.114 --> 26:13.815
Agent Cooper...

26:13.817 --> 26:16.851
I don't wanna hear you talk
about this "Saint" again.

26:16.853 --> 26:19.888
And you know what, no more
field trips for a while.

26:19.890 --> 26:21.656
You're desk bound until further notice.

26:21.658 --> 26:24.125
- It's absolute bullshit. You 'Kay?
- you wanna make it permanent?

26:39.910 --> 26:41.209
Yeah, who is it?

26:42.178 --> 26:43.278
I'd rather not say.

26:43.946 --> 26:45.213
Okay.

26:45.215 --> 26:47.115
I need protection.

26:47.117 --> 26:49.951
For me and my family.
Before I tell you anything.

26:49.953 --> 26:52.787
I need your assurance that
we will be protected.

26:52.789 --> 26:54.255
How'd you get this number?

26:54.257 --> 26:54.255
Come on, agent Cooper.

26:54.257 --> 26:58.927
That is the least interesting detail
that I have information about.

26:59.795 --> 27:01.663
Okay, you have my attention.

27:04.667 --> 27:05.800
Last night,

27:06.736 --> 27:09.137
2.5 billion dollars

27:09.139 --> 27:13.642
intended for relief in Nigeria was diverted
to several untraceable bank accounts.

27:13.644 --> 27:15.677
H-hang on. How do you know this?

27:18.414 --> 27:20.015
Because I diverted it.

27:39.835 --> 27:41.670
Yes.

28:07.763 --> 28:09.898
It was Valecross. No doubt about it.

28:11.133 --> 28:15.203
I didn't think he had the balls.
How interesting.

28:15.205 --> 28:19.207
You know, the first call he'll make will
be to the FBI, asking for protection.

28:19.209 --> 28:21.309
And he'll offer them the money in exchange.

28:21.311 --> 28:23.411
And we can't allow that to happen.

28:25.314 --> 28:26.247
Good.

28:37.493 --> 28:39.494
I'm not immature. She's being unreasonable.

28:39.496 --> 28:42.330
I'm eighteen years old, daddy.
I can go out when I want.

28:42.332 --> 28:44.866
Zooey, I didn't say you couldn't go.

28:44.868 --> 28:46.401
I just said you couldn't drive my car.

28:46.403 --> 28:48.503
I'm not talking to you, Katherine!

28:48.505 --> 28:50.271
Why did you marry her anyway?

28:50.273 --> 28:53.141
She's not even mom's age.
It's totally gross.

28:53.143 --> 28:55.343
God! Why do you always have to be so mean?

28:59.281 --> 29:01.116
Okay. I'll try.

29:08.023 --> 29:09.958
I don't speak that language.

29:09.960 --> 29:11.760
Are you here for my Dad?

29:11.762 --> 29:13.862
He deals with a lot of
sketchy, foreign guys.

29:14.797 --> 29:16.364
Because...

29:16.366 --> 29:20.101
I could not stop for death,
he kindly stopped for me.

29:20.970 --> 29:22.237
Emily Dickinson.

29:23.038 --> 29:25.140
I love her, Ms. Valecross.

29:29.411 --> 29:30.912
School's out for summer.

29:38.956 --> 29:39.855
It's a mess.

29:39.856 --> 29:43.458
We know that the fans are already
blaming him for the charges

29:43.460 --> 29:45.560
of trying to leave out of town.

29:45.562 --> 29:47.962
All right, that's all we've got time for.

29:47.964 --> 29:51.499
Now moving to headline news at the top of
the hour with our very own Fiona Krinchauf.

30:00.511 --> 30:01.410
Hello, Zooey?

30:01.411 --> 30:05.914
It's a helpless feeling, isn't it, Arnie?

30:05.916 --> 30:09.017
You take from me, I take from you.

30:09.019 --> 30:12.353
I'll get you your money back. I swear.

30:12.355 --> 30:13.888
I know you will.

30:13.890 --> 30:15.557
I just need a little bit of time.

30:15.559 --> 30:18.159
While I've got all the time in
the world, but, unfortunately,

30:18.161 --> 30:20.261
your daughter doesn't have that luxury.

30:20.996 --> 30:22.430
Please...

30:22.432 --> 30:22.430
Don't hurt her.

30:22.432 --> 30:27.068
We... her wellbeing is
entirely in your hands.

30:28.070 --> 30:29.437
I tell you what.

30:29.439 --> 30:31.139
Because I like you,

30:31.141 --> 30:32.540
you've got 48 hours.

31:22.892 --> 31:26.294
Patricia, I knew you missed me.

31:26.896 --> 31:26.895
Desperately.

31:26.897 --> 31:32.066
Really just thought you might be interested
in something I picked up at brunch.

31:32.068 --> 31:34.936
- One of the waiters.
- Ha. Cute.

31:34.938 --> 31:38.439
Actually, no. But you know that
missing aid money for Nigeria?

31:38.441 --> 31:40.675
Hard to forget 2.5 billion dollars.

31:40.677 --> 31:42.176
Exactly.

31:42.178 --> 31:44.045
Well, I've found it. All of it.

31:44.281 --> 31:45.180
Where?

31:45.181 --> 31:49.284
In accounts managed by a private banker.

31:49.286 --> 31:52.320
- Arnie Valecross. You know him?
- Heard of him.

31:53.489 --> 31:55.957
Like most thieves he tries
to stay off the radar.

31:57.226 --> 31:59.294
Sorry, old boy.

31:59.296 --> 32:01.429
Lotta people are looking for that money,

32:01.431 --> 32:03.231
none of them with good intentions.

32:03.233 --> 32:06.234
I tracked Valecross to San Diego.
Meet me there.

32:06.236 --> 32:08.069
On my way.

32:08.071 --> 32:10.071
Just need to Chuck a few things in a bag.

32:10.506 --> 32:11.706
Morning, ladies.

32:11.708 --> 32:14.108
Hi.
- -Hi

32:14.110 --> 32:17.111
oh, and I took your advice
and got rid of the beard.

32:17.113 --> 32:20.048
Whatever makes you happy. Cheers.

32:39.535 --> 32:41.002
Hey.

32:41.004 --> 32:43.037
Hey, Dora, whatcha got for me?

32:43.039 --> 32:46.607
Well, the call definitely originated from
the grand Del mar resort in San Diego.

32:46.609 --> 32:50.545
Uh-huh. -Now the guest registry
didn't bring up any obvious suspects,

32:50.547 --> 32:53.548
but I did find something interesting.

32:54.216 --> 32:54.215
Oh, yeah?

32:54.217 --> 32:59.520
So one of the guests is
listed as "Ronald Crossvale."

32:59.522 --> 33:04.158
Which is a pretty obvious
recombination of "Arnold Valecross,"

33:04.160 --> 33:09.297
a banker at BICI who's been red-flagged in
our system for the last couple of years.

33:09.299 --> 33:12.100
Thank god for the stupid criminal mind.

33:12.102 --> 33:14.435
Uh... what's BICI?

33:14.437 --> 33:17.138
Bank of international
credit and investment.

33:17.140 --> 33:19.273
IRS have been after them for years.

33:19.275 --> 33:23.578
Major tax cheats, off shore accounts,
suspected money laundering.

33:23.580 --> 33:26.247
Just the sort of people
who can not only steal

33:26.249 --> 33:28.182
but wipe clean 2.5 billion dollars.

33:28.184 --> 33:29.117
Right.

33:34.723 --> 33:36.524
What's wrong, sweetie?

33:36.526 --> 33:39.293
I don't even know why I'm bothering.
I'm grounded.

33:39.295 --> 33:43.564
There's no way that Simms is gonna let
me fly out west and deal with all this.

33:43.566 --> 33:46.467
- I've been thinking about that.
- Yeah?

33:46.469 --> 33:50.405
My girlfriend used to date a guy
in the international ops division

33:50.407 --> 33:52.607
who'd probably love to help out.

33:52.609 --> 33:54.575
Oh, yeah? Who?

33:54.577 --> 33:57.678
Special agent John Fernack.

33:57.680 --> 33:59.714
- Fernack?
- Um-hmm.

33:59.716 --> 34:02.316
- And you wanna know why?
- Huh?

34:02.318 --> 34:06.621
She says he's been chasing
your Saint for years.

34:08.223 --> 34:09.190
Really?

34:13.262 --> 34:14.195
Fernack.

34:43.525 --> 34:45.126
Please tell me you're hear.

34:45.128 --> 34:47.862
"Is Valecross here?" Is the
more important question.

34:47.864 --> 34:49.297
He is.

34:49.299 --> 34:49.297
For how much longer, I have no idea.

34:49.299 --> 34:56.204
Well, if he tries to leave, I expect you
to use your many charms to keep him there.

34:56.206 --> 34:59.107
You're such a boy, Simon Templar.

34:59.109 --> 35:02.143
- Zooey, sweetheart. Zooey!
- Help! Help me!

35:02.145 --> 35:02.143
- I don't...
- Zooey! Zooey!

35:02.145 --> 35:07.515
Daddy, they're gonna kill me.

35:07.517 --> 35:11.419
As you can hear, your daughter is getting
rather agitated. Have you got my money yet?

35:11.421 --> 35:14.589
Yes, of course. Just
tell me what I gotta do.

35:14.591 --> 35:17.391
Wire the full amount to the
account number you were sent

35:17.393 --> 35:19.560
and your daughter will be
returned to you unharmed.

35:20.662 --> 35:23.431
How can I trust you?

35:23.433 --> 35:25.733
Frankly, I don't see you
have much of a choice.

35:47.756 --> 35:49.457
Welcome to the grand Del mar.

35:49.459 --> 35:51.526
- Thank you.
- Yup.

35:53.896 --> 35:55.696
Nice ride.

35:55.698 --> 35:58.232
Thank you. Her name is Jenia.

35:58.234 --> 36:01.836
Valecross knows we have his daughter.
He'll give us the money.

36:01.838 --> 36:06.240
We've got a problem. A new problem.
Templar's here.

36:06.242 --> 36:08.209
- Simon Templar?
- Yes.

36:08.644 --> 36:11.212
Huh.

36:11.214 --> 36:14.649
I have to hand it to Valecross,
bringing in outside help...

36:14.651 --> 36:17.418
I may have underestimated him...

36:17.420 --> 36:21.722
On the other hand, the universe has a funny
was of circling back on itself, isn't it?

36:22.758 --> 36:22.757
We should kill Templar now.

36:22.759 --> 36:29.597
Patience, Marius. We don't want to spook Valecross
before he transfers the money, now, do we?

36:29.599 --> 36:32.800
Yes. But if Templar gets in the way?

36:32.802 --> 36:35.336
That I leave entirely to your discretion.

36:36.572 --> 36:38.439
This will be fun.

36:38.441 --> 36:41.776
- Pool side?
- Whenever possible.

36:41.778 --> 36:44.478
Lovely day. What exactly
are you wearing out there?

36:44.480 --> 36:46.380
Oil -huh.

36:46.382 --> 36:48.983
- Using any protection?
- Always.

36:48.985 --> 36:50.318
You know me.

36:50.986 --> 36:51.919
Hmm.

36:52.888 --> 36:54.755
Focus, darling.

36:54.757 --> 36:57.858
Our mission is to get the bank
info from the Valecross safe.

36:57.860 --> 36:59.794
It's in the Manchester suite.

36:59.796 --> 37:02.396
One guard at the door. -What
kinda safe am I hitting?

37:02.398 --> 37:03.931
Keller 9000.

37:03.933 --> 37:06.434
If he has the account data,
it will be in there.

37:06.436 --> 37:08.369
You are a very clever girl, Ms. Holm.

37:08.371 --> 37:09.337
I know.

37:18.647 --> 37:19.680
FBI.

37:27.489 --> 37:29.590
Mr. Valecross, how do you do?

37:29.592 --> 37:32.627
I'm special agent John Henry Fernack.

37:32.629 --> 37:35.396
I understand you have information
from you regarding the assets of...

37:35.398 --> 37:37.565
- no, I don't.
- You don't?

37:37.567 --> 37:39.567
Well, then why did you call the FBI?
Regarding your emp...

37:39.569 --> 37:42.370
I must have dialed the wrong
number, inspector. -Oh.

37:42.372 --> 37:43.938
I no longer work for the BICI.

37:43.940 --> 37:45.806
Were you stealing from them?
Did they catch you?

37:45.808 --> 37:46.841
Threaten you?

37:46.843 --> 37:49.577
Look, I'm sorry, inspector.

37:49.579 --> 37:51.912
- You made your trip for nothing.
- Not nothing.

37:53.348 --> 37:55.349
It's never nothing, Mr. Valecross.

37:56.518 --> 37:57.618
Good day.

38:14.603 --> 38:17.805
Oh, well. Our old friend,
special agent Fernack's here.

38:17.807 --> 38:21.342
- He followed you here from Russia.
- No, different agent.

38:21.344 --> 38:24.378
But I know these FBI
boys talk to each other.

38:24.380 --> 38:26.614
Y'know, there's something
too easy about this.

38:26.616 --> 38:28.916
I felt the same thing when
I traced the accounts.

38:28.918 --> 38:31.319
It's like Valecross wanted to be found.

38:31.321 --> 38:32.653
Simon...

38:32.655 --> 38:34.855
- Be careful.
- No risk. No reward.

38:37.459 --> 38:39.760
- So, where am I headed?
- 310.

38:39.762 --> 38:42.563
The room right next to Valecross' suite.

38:42.565 --> 38:43.764
Now, be nice to the bodyguard.

38:44.466 --> 38:45.533
Morning.

38:49.037 --> 38:50.037
Housekeeping.

38:52.107 --> 38:53.974
If you could do your
thing, please, Ms. Holm?

39:16.131 --> 39:18.566
Hey, there's a guard right
behind the adjoining door.

39:30.512 --> 39:33.114
Sorry, my friend. Nothing a
decent bloody Mary won't fix.

39:59.574 --> 40:01.809
Um, my favorite sound.

40:04.179 --> 40:06.180
Well, hello, you promising little box.

40:09.718 --> 40:11.118
You are a part of something.

40:12.454 --> 40:13.954
You've seen this before, haven't you?

40:15.056 --> 40:18.459
That is the symbol of the knights Templar.

40:19.961 --> 40:22.430
- What is it, Simon?
- What did you find?

40:25.767 --> 40:27.201
Simon?

40:29.671 --> 40:32.807
This is a very thoughtful gift, Mr.
Valecross.

40:32.809 --> 40:35.109
I've been looking for my
father's ring for a long time.

40:35.111 --> 40:36.510
May I show you something?

40:44.953 --> 40:46.687
Now, would you mind telling
me why you lured me here?

40:46.689 --> 40:49.623
I figured you wouldn't wanna
talk with a guy like me, but

40:49.625 --> 40:52.493
- maybe for 2.5 billion dollars you would.
- You figured right.

40:52.495 --> 40:54.929
Unless you're gonna cut me a
check, what can I do for you?

40:54.931 --> 40:56.497
My daughter's been kidnapped.

40:56.499 --> 40:58.499
Well, the FBI's in the building.
Why not talk to them?

40:58.501 --> 41:01.502
If I let the FBI handle this,
I'll never see my daughter again.

41:01.504 --> 41:03.637
My sympathies, Mr. Valecross,
but when you launder cash

41:03.639 --> 41:05.005
for the world's most corrupt dictators,

41:05.007 --> 41:06.240
that kind of thing tends to happen.

41:06.242 --> 41:07.942
I hid the money.

41:07.944 --> 41:09.477
I was going to give it to the FBI

41:09.479 --> 41:10.911
but my daughter was taken
before I could turn it over.

41:10.913 --> 41:14.048
Look... if they'll exchange her
for the money, just do it.

41:14.050 --> 41:16.817
They'll just kill me.
They'll kill my daughter.

41:16.819 --> 41:18.886
She doesn't deserve that.

41:18.888 --> 41:20.187
That's why I need you.

41:21.022 --> 41:22.790
To handle the exchange.

41:22.792 --> 41:23.958
To help us get away safely.

41:25.260 --> 41:27.661
Please.

41:27.663 --> 41:28.929
You're the Saint.

41:28.931 --> 41:30.965
You Americans always take
everything so literally.

41:36.271 --> 41:38.138
Simon, Simon, get outta there, now!

41:47.782 --> 41:49.817
Everybody, clear out, now!

42:17.112 --> 42:18.679
Brace for hard landing!

42:28.890 --> 42:30.291
It's okay. It's okay.

42:32.193 --> 42:35.763
The account numbers... Are in your ring.

42:35.765 --> 42:38.933
The key is a nomad. Please...

42:38.935 --> 42:40.734
Save my little girl.

42:43.171 --> 42:44.738
Where did you get the ring?

42:50.045 --> 42:52.780
Simon Templar. Remember me?

42:52.782 --> 42:55.082
Put the bloody gun down,
Fernack, and call an ambulance.

42:55.084 --> 42:57.985
Put the gun down, no. Put your hands up!

42:58.286 --> 42:59.320
Now!

43:01.723 --> 43:04.325
After years of chasing
you around the globe,

43:04.327 --> 43:05.893
I finally got the Saint.

43:07.596 --> 43:08.596
Simon!

43:29.217 --> 43:31.018
- Good to see you.
- You too.

43:31.020 --> 43:32.953
- Valecross?
- 'Fraid not.

43:32.955 --> 43:34.154
But we need to find his daughter.

43:56.111 --> 43:58.178
This had better be good news.

43:58.180 --> 44:01.115
Things got a little out of hand.

44:01.117 --> 44:03.150
- Valecross is dead.
- And Templar?

44:03.752 --> 44:04.952
Templar got away.

44:04.954 --> 44:06.687
Probably with my money.

44:06.689 --> 44:08.389
You losing your touch, Marius?

44:08.391 --> 44:09.890
I can fix this.

44:09.892 --> 44:11.959
Yes, well, I sincerely hope so.

44:24.973 --> 44:26.040
Simon!

44:27.042 --> 44:28.075
Simon?

44:34.215 --> 44:36.016
Why didn't you answer
when you heard me call?

44:36.018 --> 44:39.153
I'm sorry, I was reading.

44:40.255 --> 44:42.256
I have someone I want you to meet.

44:42.258 --> 44:44.958
Someone very special. His name is Xander.

44:44.960 --> 44:46.427
How do you do, Sir?

44:46.429 --> 44:48.128
I do just fine, young man.

44:50.932 --> 44:52.066
Well, I should leave you to it.

44:53.935 --> 44:55.235
Leave us to what?

44:55.237 --> 44:57.271
I think I'll let Xander explain that.

44:58.373 --> 44:59.440
Good luck.

45:07.015 --> 45:09.817
I've heard you've been having
some troubles at school.

45:09.819 --> 45:11.752
Don't be ashamed, Simon.

45:12.821 --> 45:14.388
It happens to the best of us.

45:17.425 --> 45:19.193
What are you?

45:19.195 --> 45:21.795
- A head doctor?
- A head doctor?

45:21.797 --> 45:23.964
You know, a psychiatrist.

45:23.966 --> 45:26.066
No. While I like to believe

45:26.068 --> 45:28.836
that my teachings help heal mind and body,

45:28.838 --> 45:30.738
I'm not a doctor.

45:30.740 --> 45:33.240
I'm a trainer.

45:33.242 --> 45:36.276
After we get finished here, no
bully in the entire United Kingdom

45:36.278 --> 45:37.745
will dare mess with you.

45:40.381 --> 45:41.915
Good reflexes.

45:43.818 --> 45:44.918
Now hit me.

45:44.920 --> 45:46.453
- What?
- Hit me.

45:46.455 --> 45:48.922
Don't be scared.

45:48.924 --> 45:51.158
Loosen up a little on the grip. That's it.

46:00.368 --> 46:01.869
Lesson one:

46:01.871 --> 46:04.271
Never take your eyes off your opponent.

46:04.273 --> 46:06.807
- Can you teach me to do that?
- Yes.

46:07.175 --> 46:08.909
And much more.

46:08.911 --> 46:10.244
Now, hit me again.

46:21.790 --> 46:23.023
That's crazy.

46:23.025 --> 46:24.858
A helicopter attack in broad daylight.

46:24.860 --> 46:27.361
You know what, I'm gonna
sleep with my shoes on.

46:27.363 --> 46:30.230
There's never a dull moment
when Simon Templar comes to la.

46:30.232 --> 46:32.199
How's all that gear working out for you?

46:32.201 --> 46:36.570
I can see why you're Simon's go-to
for local transport and op-tech.

46:36.572 --> 46:38.205
Doyle, any chance for some breakfast?

46:38.207 --> 46:40.808
It's two boiled eggs, toast,
marmalade, and a pint of coffee.

46:40.810 --> 46:40.808
What, do you think I'd forget, Boss?

46:40.810 --> 46:45.813
Okay, so we got two and a half billion
dollars floating in the wind.

46:45.815 --> 46:48.816
I've always wanted to buy my own Hawaii.

46:48.818 --> 46:52.419
What's ten percent of two and a
half billion split three ways?

46:52.421 --> 46:54.855
83.3 million.

46:54.857 --> 46:58.892
The money is ransom for the banker's
daughter, we're not keeping it.

46:58.894 --> 47:00.961
Sorry if that puts a damper on
your real estate ambitions.

47:00.963 --> 47:03.897
How are we going to find all this money
that, we're not, you know, keeping?

47:03.899 --> 47:03.897
My long lost ring.

47:03.899 --> 47:08.001
Valecross said that the account
numbers are on it somewhere.

47:08.003 --> 47:10.904
The Templar cross. -Symbolizing those
who have dedicated their lives

47:10.906 --> 47:12.139
to the service of others.

47:13.007 --> 47:14.141
In theory anyway.

47:14.143 --> 47:15.475
The inscription is Latin.

47:16.511 --> 47:18.445
<i>Nullum est periculum. Non mercedi.</i>

47:19.480 --> 47:20.614
No risk. No reward.

47:22.884 --> 47:24.084
That's recent work.

47:25.320 --> 47:26.320
Oh, yes.

47:27.989 --> 47:28.922
Ha.

47:33.461 --> 47:36.230
I think that is what
detectives would call a clue.

47:36.232 --> 47:38.031
Looks like a diamond.

47:38.033 --> 47:39.967
- It's synthetic.
- Doyle,

47:39.969 --> 47:44.004
does this house we're squatting
in have a DVD player?

47:44.006 --> 47:47.374
With all due respect, you are as
beautiful as you are tech friendly.

47:47.376 --> 47:50.244
Where did you find her? -It
was the Rubalkali desert

47:50.246 --> 47:53.180
and she was the vision of
grace in dire circumstances.

47:53.182 --> 47:56.483
It was hardly dire. I had
the situation well in hand.

48:47.102 --> 48:50.437
A beautiful woman in chains, three dead
bodies, sixty miles south of Baghdad.

48:50.439 --> 48:51.705
I can't wait to hear this one.

48:51.707 --> 48:53.206
Ha! Uh-uh.

48:55.677 --> 48:57.144
You know, if you let me put my hands down

48:57.146 --> 48:59.379
I might be able to find
the key to those chains.

48:59.381 --> 49:01.448
- You're British?
- To the core.

49:01.450 --> 49:03.383
I even understand cricket.

49:03.385 --> 49:05.352
- Special forces?
- Motorcycle holiday.

49:05.620 --> 49:07.054
In Iraq?

49:07.056 --> 49:08.555
Well, the gas is very
cheap here at the moment.

49:09.157 --> 49:10.157
Hm.

49:11.159 --> 49:12.259
Do you have a name?

49:12.627 --> 49:13.660
Patricia holm.

49:14.562 --> 49:16.596
Simon Templar.

49:16.598 --> 49:18.432
Can I offer you a lift somewhere, Ms. holm?

49:23.304 --> 49:24.738
That's enough of the flattery.

49:24.740 --> 49:26.573
It's only flattery, Ms.
holm, if it isn't true.

49:27.675 --> 49:29.710
Now, what are we looking at here?

49:29.712 --> 49:29.710
Scrambled bank account numbers, I assume.

49:29.712 --> 49:35.649
I need the right frequency to decrypt
the data and a password or a key.

49:35.651 --> 49:38.318
Before he died, valecross
said the key is in the nomad.

49:38.320 --> 49:41.722
A nomad is a digital file, it
doesn't live on a computer.

49:41.724 --> 49:44.992
But in separate packets, on
multiple servers. Not here.

49:44.994 --> 49:44.992
I love it when you talk nerd.

49:44.994 --> 49:49.062
So we need to find this nomad,
get the key, read the crystal,

49:49.064 --> 49:51.298
swap it for the girl, and Bob's your uncle.

49:51.300 --> 49:53.433
- So where the devil do we start?
- The valecross home?

49:54.569 --> 49:56.503
Doyle, have you checked the garage?

50:02.110 --> 50:04.211
I love a flash ride.

50:04.213 --> 50:06.013
But we have the kids.

50:06.015 --> 50:07.180
It's a family trip, love.

50:10.718 --> 50:13.320
- Trust me, Cap'n.
- Exact same dough.

50:13.322 --> 50:15.222
It's like zygotes, they
could go either way.

50:15.224 --> 50:18.692
You know, it's a pizza or
donuts, donuts or pizza.

50:18.694 --> 50:21.094
Hey, donut-pizza.

50:21.096 --> 50:23.296
- There's another one.
- Yeah, there's another one.

50:25.400 --> 50:27.034
- FBI.
- Whoa!

50:27.036 --> 50:28.769
Special agent John Henry fernack.

50:28.771 --> 50:30.270
You must be captain Miller.

50:30.272 --> 50:33.273
And I'm, uh, I'm Garces.
Detective actually.

50:33.275 --> 50:36.676
You know, the guys down at the precinct
said you, uh, you might be here.

50:36.678 --> 50:39.513
Oh, yeah, this is our spot. -I got
the call you'd be showing up.

50:39.515 --> 50:41.648
You could've let me finish my lunch.
What's this about?

50:41.650 --> 50:43.650
About this. Simon Templar.

50:43.652 --> 50:46.253
International thief coming
out of London and New York.

50:46.255 --> 50:47.587
I've been chasing him for years.

50:47.589 --> 50:50.323
- And?
- And he's here, in la.

50:50.325 --> 50:51.358
I need the help of a native.

50:53.694 --> 50:54.761
I'm one-eighth Cherokee.

51:01.235 --> 51:03.770
Take him. Please.

51:03.772 --> 51:05.405
- The Cherokee?
- Thanks, Cap'n.

51:06.441 --> 51:07.541
It's gonna be fun.

51:11.112 --> 51:15.282
Who are we today? -Insurance investigators,
here to appraise the estate.

51:15.284 --> 51:18.785
You keep her busy, I'll scan the
electronics for signs of the nomad.

51:21.322 --> 51:22.823
Mrs. valecross,

51:22.825 --> 51:24.691
so sorry for your loss.

51:24.693 --> 51:27.561
We represent the holders of
your husband's life insurance.

51:27.563 --> 51:28.728
Are you Simon Templar?

51:32.633 --> 51:33.633
Yes.

51:34.402 --> 51:37.337
- Yes, I am.
- Come in.

51:37.339 --> 51:40.340
I heard what happened to
Arnie on the radio...

51:40.342 --> 51:42.109
When I was coming home from work.

51:43.544 --> 51:45.645
When I walked into the house,
the phone was ringing.

51:46.647 --> 51:49.683
It was the kidnappers.

51:49.685 --> 51:54.855
They said you'd be coming, and if I
called the police, they'd kill zooey.

51:54.857 --> 51:57.424
Until that moment, you had
no idea she had been taken.

51:57.426 --> 51:59.826
No. I thought she was out with friends.

52:04.632 --> 52:06.833
Zooey and I never really got along.

52:06.835 --> 52:09.536
She thought I was too
young to be with her Dad.

52:09.538 --> 52:11.438
Mrs. valecross...

52:11.440 --> 52:13.807
How much did you know about
Arnie's banking activities?

52:15.476 --> 52:19.346
I knew the men Arnie represented were evil.

52:19.348 --> 52:24.317
I knew he helped them steal and hide
billions from the countries they ruled.

52:24.319 --> 52:26.553
But, you know, recently...

52:26.555 --> 52:28.722
I don't know, maybe through
my influence, he...

52:29.557 --> 52:31.825
He had a change of heart.

52:31.827 --> 52:34.561
He wanted that money to go
back to those countries.

52:34.563 --> 52:37.297
Back to those people just so
they could have better lives.

52:38.299 --> 52:40.667
But I feel so guilty, like

52:40.669 --> 52:43.670
I'm responsible for what happened
to my husband and zooey.

52:43.672 --> 52:44.871
You shouldn't blame yourself.

52:46.340 --> 52:48.308
I'm gonna find that money

52:48.310 --> 52:50.177
and use it to bring your stepdaughter home.

52:50.678 --> 52:51.645
Okay?

52:53.214 --> 52:54.748
Thank you.

52:54.750 --> 52:57.551
I scanned the computers, but
the drives have been wiped.

52:57.553 --> 53:00.320
Arnie must have done it
remotely before he was killed.

53:00.322 --> 53:02.222
So where lies our nomad?

53:02.224 --> 53:05.659
The data we need is off-site.
It'll take time to find it.

53:05.661 --> 53:06.793
Time we don't have.

53:09.530 --> 53:11.631
Kidnappers didn't happen to leave
their phone numbers, did they?

53:24.579 --> 53:26.546
Keep him talking as long as you can.

53:27.348 --> 53:28.615
Templar.

53:28.617 --> 53:30.584
Shame I missed you in San Diego.

53:30.586 --> 53:32.786
Sorry about your helicopter, old boy.

53:32.788 --> 53:35.322
It's okay. It was stolen.

53:35.324 --> 53:37.824
I'm more upset about you
destroying my arms deal.

53:37.826 --> 53:39.726
Well, that container of
assault rifles in Mali?

53:39.728 --> 53:41.261
I thought that blew up rather nicely.

53:41.796 --> 53:44.731
Shall we set the exchange?

53:44.733 --> 53:46.399
The girl for the money?

53:46.401 --> 53:48.535
I need a bit more time.

53:48.537 --> 53:51.338
So why don't you send the girl
home to mum as a sign of goodwill,

53:51.340 --> 53:53.306
and Patricia and I will
keep looking for the money.

53:53.308 --> 53:56.009
You know I can't release
her without cash in hand.

53:56.011 --> 53:58.645
Let's say 24 hours, and she dies.

54:00.015 --> 54:01.915
Tell Patricia I say "hello."

54:05.987 --> 54:07.887
Rayt Marius says "hello."

54:08.489 --> 54:09.556
Does he?

54:09.558 --> 54:10.690
Didn't know you two were acquainted.

54:11.525 --> 54:12.926
Before your time, darling.

54:16.564 --> 54:18.365
I only got a partial trace.

54:18.367 --> 54:19.833
Not enough to get his exact location.

54:21.802 --> 54:24.371
The money? Can you get the money?

54:24.373 --> 54:27.574
Rayt's waiting for it, which
means we have a bit of time,

54:27.576 --> 54:28.775
but we need to get moving.

54:31.712 --> 54:35.415
If I don't see the money, you'll
die just like your daddy.

54:35.583 --> 54:36.549
No!

54:44.725 --> 54:46.026
Please stop.

54:46.028 --> 54:47.460
- Please.
- Okay.

54:48.562 --> 54:50.664
I'm in a band with a bunch of Cops.

54:50.666 --> 54:52.866
I've got that metronome going... - that
explains it. You know what? Carry on.

55:00.708 --> 55:03.743
Let me ask you a question. The
guy that we want is right there.

55:03.745 --> 55:03.743
Why don't we grab him?

55:03.745 --> 55:07.047
No, that would be the
worst move we can make.

55:07.049 --> 55:09.949
- If we wanted to bust him.
- I'm just saying.

55:09.951 --> 55:11.785
He's a person of interest
in the valecross homicide.

55:11.787 --> 55:14.321
No, because he's our best chance
of recovering that money.

55:14.323 --> 55:15.755
The minute he gets it, I will be there.

55:15.757 --> 55:17.824
All we need to worry about
is not losing sight of him.

55:36.410 --> 55:38.378
Doyle, corner of Grandview and lake.

55:38.380 --> 55:38.378
That's Arnie's data facility.

55:38.380 --> 55:43.783
Can you hack into it? -I'm
testing their firewalls.

55:43.785 --> 55:47.420
Hard to imagine you and Rayt
Marius having much to talk about.

55:47.422 --> 55:49.055
You're right. We didn't.

55:49.057 --> 55:52.092
So, what exactly did you and he do?

55:52.094 --> 55:54.027
Simon...

55:54.029 --> 55:57.497
What? I'm entitled to some
degree of curiosity, aren't I?

55:57.499 --> 55:59.399
We have been on the road
together for a year now.

55:59.401 --> 56:03.903
And by design we've avoided any
nights of wine addled over-sharing.

56:03.905 --> 56:05.138
We all have our secrets.

56:11.078 --> 56:12.512
Okay, back off, back off, back off.

56:12.514 --> 56:14.047
I'm sorry, you gotta stop.
I can't take that.

56:14.049 --> 56:16.082
What? -The yelling. I
cannot take the yelling.

56:16.084 --> 56:18.952
You told me to-to stay close to these guys.

56:18.954 --> 56:21.521
Fine. It's just that if you
rear end them, guess what?

56:21.523 --> 56:22.989
They're gonna know we're behind them!

56:22.991 --> 56:26.126
- I never tailed anyone.
- How are you a detective?

56:26.128 --> 56:27.861
Guys, the firewall is too heavy.

56:27.863 --> 56:30.830
We'll have to find an interesting
way to liberate that file.

56:30.832 --> 56:33.099
Gonna be really interesting.
I think we're being tailed.

56:35.803 --> 56:38.471
Oh, bloody hell, it's fernack.

56:41.776 --> 56:42.976
- Darling...
- Hmm?

56:42.978 --> 56:44.110
Can you run in those heels?

56:48.015 --> 56:49.115
You see?

56:57.057 --> 56:58.825
Out of the way. FBI. Move.

57:01.595 --> 57:03.930
Garces, go after her!

57:04.732 --> 57:06.633
She's faster than him!

57:06.635 --> 57:07.801
Hey, out of the way.

57:45.072 --> 57:46.039
Freeze!

57:53.714 --> 57:56.082
Where are you gonna go now? Hmm?

57:58.185 --> 57:59.552
You're under arrest.

58:08.629 --> 58:11.598
Really, fernack? Three guns?
You only have two hands.

58:17.738 --> 58:19.272
Enjoy this moment.

58:19.274 --> 58:21.674
'Cause I'll be coming after you again.

58:21.676 --> 58:24.978
You know, it doesn't have to be like
this, fernack. We could work together.

58:24.980 --> 58:26.746
I don't work with criminals.

58:26.748 --> 58:27.881
I lock 'em up.

58:28.516 --> 58:29.816
Not me, my friend.

58:31.085 --> 58:32.185
Not ever.

58:50.638 --> 58:53.806
Sorry I'm late. -You're not late, darling.
You're on Simon time.

58:53.808 --> 58:55.942
How'd you leave things with agent fernack?

58:55.944 --> 58:57.644
Better than that car factory in Cologne,

58:57.646 --> 59:00.580
but, uh, slightly more
humiliating than Mumbai.

59:00.582 --> 59:00.580
Hm.

59:00.582 --> 59:03.816
So the data storage
facility's in there, is it?

59:03.818 --> 59:07.086
- Yeah. The nomad file is on their network.
- In a server room somewhere.

59:07.088 --> 59:08.955
We'll use that trick from studio Nippon.

59:08.957 --> 59:10.757
- Following the power drain.
- Yeah.

59:13.129 --> 59:14.028
Gotcha.

59:14.029 --> 59:16.763
The servers are in the sub-basement.

59:16.765 --> 59:18.231
And the nomad packets?

59:18.233 --> 59:20.800
- How do we hook those fish?
- A bait box.

59:20.802 --> 59:22.802
Splice into the hard line,
send 'em out one by one.

59:22.804 --> 59:25.138
That leads us to the money, which
we then swap for the girl.

59:25.140 --> 59:25.138
One problem.

59:25.140 --> 59:29.175
The valecross accounts shut
down and reboot at 6:00 A.M.

59:29.177 --> 59:30.343
Then we'll never find the money.

59:30.345 --> 59:32.912
Simon, Rayt will kill zooey.

59:34.114 --> 59:34.113
We need to gear up as soon as possible.

59:34.115 --> 59:39.319
On that clock? There's only one spot in
town that will have the gear we need.

59:39.321 --> 59:42.322
- Sonali Alvez.
- I haven't seen her since Rio.

59:42.324 --> 59:45.124
There's no chance she's
forgiven you for that, Boss.

59:45.126 --> 59:46.159
What happened in Rio?

59:47.795 --> 59:50.296
Um... Carnivale.

59:50.298 --> 59:51.297
Ah.

59:57.838 --> 59:59.872
Who's Sonali Alvez?

59:59.874 --> 01:00:01.908
I'm not surprised Simon has
not told you about her.

01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:03.276
- Is she a butcher?
- Sometimes.

01:00:04.078 --> 01:00:05.945
Is it too late to order?

01:00:05.947 --> 01:00:09.282
I'm thinking some <i>queijo minas</i> with
pinhao in a half-moon pasteis.

01:00:09.284 --> 01:00:11.084
And maybe some <i>cuscuz branco.</i>

01:00:26.735 --> 01:00:28.735
So what happened in Rio?

01:00:28.737 --> 01:00:29.969
Before your time, darling.

01:00:32.039 --> 01:00:34.273
Sonali, good to see you.

01:00:37.345 --> 01:00:39.679
You used to be happy to see my face.

01:00:39.681 --> 01:00:41.681
Remember breakfast in
bed at the Copa palace?

01:00:43.751 --> 01:00:45.385
Whoa, whoa, whoa, tranquilo, huh?

01:00:45.387 --> 01:00:49.122
You clip me, I take out your Boss.

01:00:49.124 --> 01:00:52.258
Sonali, I know I'm not your favorite
person anymore, but we need your help.

01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:55.261
You burned my super note
deal, I lost everything.

01:00:55.263 --> 01:00:58.231
The ink, that copier
built to federal specs.

01:00:58.233 --> 01:00:59.932
Look, we had a wonderful time together

01:00:59.934 --> 01:01:02.735
but I simply couldn't let you
destabilize the global economy.

01:01:02.737 --> 01:01:05.805
- An influx of counterfeit cash...
- Simon... now is not the time.

01:01:07.241 --> 01:01:09.342
Listen to me, we need your help.

01:01:09.344 --> 01:01:12.912
A girl's been kidnapped. In order to save
her, we need to buy some of your gear.

01:01:12.914 --> 01:01:15.181
- We have cash.
- We pay retail.

01:01:16.684 --> 01:01:19.452
- Hmm... you two are okay.
- All right.

01:01:19.454 --> 01:01:21.320
But him...

01:01:21.322 --> 01:01:23.456
He's gotta pay for what he's done.

01:01:23.458 --> 01:01:25.091
<i>Obter o rinoceronte.</i>

01:01:28.329 --> 01:01:29.829
Rhinoceros?

01:01:47.114 --> 01:01:48.448
Perhaps we could talk about this.

01:01:50.818 --> 01:01:52.919
Let's pack another freon spinner,

01:01:52.921 --> 01:01:56.989
the acidic gel, and the fiber-optic
splicer with petabyte piggy back.

01:01:56.991 --> 01:01:58.424
- A bait box?
- Oh, yeah.

01:02:00.095 --> 01:02:01.794
Do you need anything else?

01:02:01.796 --> 01:02:04.897
Uh... nope. I think I'm good.

01:02:04.899 --> 01:02:06.866
Are you not at all concerned about Simon?

01:02:15.075 --> 01:02:16.008
Oh.

01:02:25.819 --> 01:02:27.920
You're a big boy. You're aware, of course,

01:02:27.922 --> 01:02:30.256
the steroids cause liver damage
and erectile dysfunction?

01:02:34.061 --> 01:02:38.531
Other side effects include acne, testicular
atrophy and prostate swelling. Seriously.

01:02:54.948 --> 01:02:56.983
Thank you. Thank you.

01:02:57.785 --> 01:02:59.418
Thank you. Thank you.

01:03:02.389 --> 01:03:04.023
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:03:04.025 --> 01:03:05.191
Here's your 40.

01:03:05.193 --> 01:03:05.191
Um...

01:03:05.193 --> 01:03:08.795
It was good doing business
with you, girl. -Likewise.

01:03:08.797 --> 01:03:10.997
- Sorry about your guy.
- He's not my guy.

01:03:10.999 --> 01:03:12.799
We're associates.

01:03:13.433 --> 01:03:15.268
He has never made love to you?

01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:18.037
Are you recommending it?

01:03:18.039 --> 01:03:21.908
Much as I would love to hear the answer
to that, aah, we have somewhere to be.

01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:23.476
- Are we done here?
- Hmm.

01:03:23.478 --> 01:03:24.877
Very good.

01:03:24.879 --> 01:03:26.212
- Sonali.
- Hmm?

01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:30.416
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

01:03:41.296 --> 01:03:43.396
I thought you said you
weren't one to take a punch.

01:03:43.398 --> 01:03:45.164
Oh, it's all pretend.

01:03:45.166 --> 01:03:47.033
How are we for time?

01:03:47.968 --> 01:03:49.836
The server resets in 40.

01:03:49.838 --> 01:03:52.138
Your point of entry is the emergency exit.

01:03:54.008 --> 01:03:57.877
Simon, are you sure you can muster
the strength for a midnight heist?

01:03:57.879 --> 01:04:00.112
Of course I can muster, Patricia.
I'm British.

01:04:00.114 --> 01:04:01.214
We invented muster.

01:04:01.216 --> 01:04:03.049
- Did you?
- Yeah.

01:04:08.222 --> 01:04:10.356
I found Templar, with the girl.

01:04:10.358 --> 01:04:12.225
They are on their way to the money.

01:04:12.227 --> 01:04:13.893
This may work out as planned.

01:04:13.895 --> 01:04:17.330
If I want your opinion,
Marius, I will ask for it.

01:04:17.332 --> 01:04:20.600
Simon Templar is not going to
just hand over 2.5 billion.

01:04:20.602 --> 01:04:22.501
He's going to try and be a hero.

01:04:22.503 --> 01:04:24.270
What would you like me to do?

01:04:24.272 --> 01:04:26.572
- Your job.
- Okay.

01:04:33.413 --> 01:04:36.916
I am not going to let an innocent
girl pay for the sins of her father.

01:04:36.918 --> 01:04:41.387
Saintly courage worthy of a Templar.

01:04:41.389 --> 01:04:45.658
The Templars are nothing but a boy's own
bedtime story, of medieval knights gone bad.

01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:49.428
And yet you go, charging to the
rescue, heart on your sleeve.

01:04:54.134 --> 01:04:55.134
Here.

01:04:57.638 --> 01:04:59.906
Can you keep this safe
for me while I'm inside?

01:05:01.508 --> 01:05:04.110
Giving me a ring without taking a knee?

01:05:08.348 --> 01:05:13.019
Well, I'd hate to ruin this wonderful
friendship that neither one of us deserve.

01:05:16.156 --> 01:05:17.556
Will you agree, Ms. holm?

01:05:18.558 --> 01:05:21.227
No risk. No reward.

01:05:28.602 --> 01:05:29.669
That's it.

01:05:33.573 --> 01:05:34.607
Hey!

01:05:42.416 --> 01:05:43.683
What's wrong?

01:05:43.685 --> 01:05:45.718
- That wasn't fair.
- Fair.

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:49.121
No battle in the history of mankind
has ever been "fair," Simon.

01:05:49.123 --> 01:05:49.121
This isn't a game,

01:05:49.123 --> 01:05:54.026
where rules exist to ensure
integrity between participants

01:05:54.028 --> 01:05:56.696
in order to determine a winner and loser.

01:05:56.698 --> 01:05:58.331
This is life.

01:05:58.333 --> 01:06:01.200
Was it fair to the Japanese at Hiroshima?

01:06:01.202 --> 01:06:03.402
Or what about the Jews in Poland?

01:06:05.073 --> 01:06:08.074
"Fair" is something created by the weak,

01:06:08.076 --> 01:06:11.510
because they know they
can't defeat the strong.

01:06:11.512 --> 01:06:14.213
But what about honor?

01:06:14.215 --> 01:06:17.049
I know you love your Templar
knight stories, Simon,

01:06:17.051 --> 01:06:21.020
but at some point you'll have
to realize that they're just...

01:06:21.022 --> 01:06:22.755
Stories.

01:06:22.757 --> 01:06:26.459
It is survival of the fittest out there.

01:06:26.461 --> 01:06:29.996
Your enemies will seek out any
and all advantages they can.

01:06:29.998 --> 01:06:32.431
You must be prepared.

01:06:32.433 --> 01:06:36.369
How do you prepare for the unexpected?

01:06:37.504 --> 01:06:39.472
By expecting everything.

01:06:57.124 --> 01:06:59.325
I'm at the outer access door.

01:06:59.327 --> 01:07:01.093
You need to disable the alarm.

01:07:01.095 --> 01:07:04.096
I'm on it. I've got Doyle
flying in to plant the hotspot.

01:07:04.098 --> 01:07:06.198
If I have to, someone's getting tased.

01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:07.533
Just get in there.

01:07:07.535 --> 01:07:09.635
Excuse me. Hi.

01:07:09.637 --> 01:07:11.337
Sorry to disturb you. Um...

01:07:11.339 --> 01:07:14.040
I was just wondering if you could
show me where the restroom is.

01:07:15.242 --> 01:07:16.442
No.

01:07:16.444 --> 01:07:19.378
Okay... guess I'm just
gonna have to hold it.

01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:20.713
But you got a bad attitude, pal.

01:07:25.085 --> 01:07:26.752
- What is this?
- Um...

01:07:32.659 --> 01:07:34.760
Honestly. Who fitted these locks?

01:07:34.762 --> 01:07:37.396
Give me a minute, darling.
Doyle's got a problem.

01:07:41.368 --> 01:07:42.268
Oof!

01:07:45.605 --> 01:07:48.407
Okay, okay, okay, I can explain.
I can explain.

01:07:50.178 --> 01:07:52.078
- You know what? Talk to her.
- She'll explain. She'll explain.

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:53.412
No, seriously. You should
have a conversation with her.

01:07:53.414 --> 01:07:54.547
You want me?

01:07:59.252 --> 01:08:01.220
You got this? -Yeah, I got the
whole situation under control.

01:08:01.222 --> 01:08:02.555
Go, you go! Go, go, go!

01:08:03.090 --> 01:08:04.090
Go!

01:08:04.092 --> 01:08:05.825
Come here, buddy. Come here.

01:08:05.827 --> 01:08:05.825
Back on task, Simon.

01:08:05.827 --> 01:08:09.528
Huh? Have a little conversation
with manners. Huh?

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:14.867
Alarm is down. Go, go, go.

01:08:17.136 --> 01:08:18.304
That's weird.

01:08:18.305 --> 01:08:20.506
That guy was unconscious two seconds ago.

01:08:22.709 --> 01:08:23.843
Um...

01:08:31.751 --> 01:08:35.354
All right, the best way into the
server room is through the vault door.

01:08:35.356 --> 01:08:38.657
Careful, it's rigged with explosive
bolts, and if these are touched

01:08:38.658 --> 01:08:38.657
an alarm is triggered,

01:08:38.658 --> 01:08:42.194
and a set of secondary doors are released.

01:08:42.196 --> 01:08:44.529
You're going to have to leave
those hinges in place.

01:08:57.412 --> 01:08:58.310
I'm through.

01:08:58.312 --> 01:09:01.580
Now, the floor behind the escape hatch

01:09:01.582 --> 01:09:04.517
is made up of pressure
sensitive floating tiles.

01:09:04.519 --> 01:09:06.785
These must be frozen before
you can step on them.

01:09:06.787 --> 01:09:09.787
The tiles will thaw in ten seconds.
So be quick.

01:09:22.502 --> 01:09:24.270
I'm at the biometric scanner.

01:09:24.904 --> 01:09:27.206
You, uh, give me a hand?

01:09:27.207 --> 01:09:32.545
You are now Sidney Felzberg...
No, make that Alexandra Krevoy.

01:09:43.490 --> 01:09:44.823
Okay, I'm in.

01:09:44.825 --> 01:09:46.959
Set the bait box. Start the download.

01:09:58.638 --> 01:10:00.472
All right, let's go fishing.

01:10:06.846 --> 01:10:10.349
- Hello, Ms. holm.
- Fernack.

01:10:10.351 --> 01:10:11.984
Finally.

01:10:11.986 --> 01:10:13.519
Looks like he's in the server room.

01:10:13.521 --> 01:10:15.588
Watch her. I'm going to go after Templar.

01:10:18.325 --> 01:10:19.792
I'm garces.

01:10:19.794 --> 01:10:20.993
Detective garces.

01:10:21.661 --> 01:10:22.728
Charmed.

01:10:23.964 --> 01:10:25.965
FBI.

01:10:25.967 --> 01:10:27.967
- Where's your server room?
- It's in the basement.

01:10:27.969 --> 01:10:30.703
You, black jacket. Wipe your nose,
grab your gun, you come with me.

01:10:30.705 --> 01:10:32.271
- Yes, Sir.
- What about me?

01:10:32.273 --> 01:10:33.405
Yeah, what about you?

01:11:27.594 --> 01:11:28.994
Hello.

01:11:28.996 --> 01:11:30.596
Hand me the bag.

01:11:30.598 --> 01:11:32.965
Fernack, if I do that, an
innocent girl is going to die.

01:11:32.967 --> 01:11:36.602
Saving people's lives is my job, not yours.

01:11:36.604 --> 01:11:37.603
Whatever you say.

01:11:55.755 --> 01:11:56.855
Templar!

01:12:05.098 --> 01:12:06.865
I could... I couldn't stop him.

01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:08.534
He took her.

01:12:09.836 --> 01:12:10.869
I'm sorry.

01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:15.741
I told you I was going
to catch you, didn't I?

01:12:15.743 --> 01:12:17.710
Your concern for your
colleague is touching.

01:12:17.712 --> 01:12:19.511
He's not dead.

01:12:19.513 --> 01:12:21.380
Let's go.

01:12:21.382 --> 01:12:22.681
No...

01:12:22.683 --> 01:12:24.016
It's Ms. holm.

01:12:24.018 --> 01:12:25.918
Special agent John Henry fernack.

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:28.687
- I have to talk to Simon.
- He's listening.

01:12:28.689 --> 01:12:31.557
Simon, I need the crystal from your ring.

01:12:31.559 --> 01:12:34.860
It's the only way I can access
the valecross accounts.

01:12:34.862 --> 01:12:38.997
I have a yacht at the port
of Los Angeles. Pier 5.

01:12:38.999 --> 01:12:43.068
Be here by sun up. And Templar,
do I need to say "come alone"?

01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:44.870
Marius will kill them both
if we don't stop them.

01:12:45.372 --> 01:12:47.106
We?

01:12:47.108 --> 01:12:49.408
I'll call it in. -Come on, believe me.

01:12:49.410 --> 01:12:52.745
If you do that, they are
already dead. Okay?

01:12:55.648 --> 01:12:56.715
It's your call.

01:13:01.454 --> 01:13:04.590
These are the account numbers
you will use for the transfer.

01:13:07.594 --> 01:13:08.727
One question.

01:13:10.397 --> 01:13:11.930
When did you lose your mind?

01:13:11.932 --> 01:13:12.931
Get it done.

01:13:26.179 --> 01:13:28.680
You really think you're
something, don't you?

01:13:29.816 --> 01:13:31.116
British accent.

01:13:31.118 --> 01:13:32.551
Designer clothes.

01:13:33.086 --> 01:13:35.854
Hot little sidekick.

01:13:35.856 --> 01:13:38.824
She's not my "side-kick,"
she's my associate.

01:13:38.826 --> 01:13:40.726
A position I'd like her to retain.

01:13:40.728 --> 01:13:42.928
You do know we're riding
into a trap, don't you?

01:13:44.531 --> 01:13:46.198
I think that's the one
thing we can count on.

01:14:04.217 --> 01:14:05.918
There are six guards on deck.

01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:09.121
Once I've taken care of them,
get in, take the girl, get out.

01:14:12.525 --> 01:14:13.659
When all this is over...

01:14:14.694 --> 01:14:15.627
I'm taking you in.

01:14:32.847 --> 01:14:34.213
Move! Move!

01:14:49.629 --> 01:14:52.197
Taking a cruise without me, darling?

01:14:52.199 --> 01:14:56.001
Ever the hero. How predictable.
The ring, if you please.

01:14:56.003 --> 01:14:57.069
Where's the girl?

01:14:58.373 --> 01:14:59.272
Bring her up.

01:14:59.273 --> 01:15:01.740
Send her up.

01:15:01.742 --> 01:15:04.610
Here. Finish the job, or I finish you.

01:15:05.812 --> 01:15:07.613
That's not how you talk to a lady.

01:15:07.615 --> 01:15:09.715
I talk to my wife any way I please.

01:15:09.717 --> 01:15:10.849
Ex-wife!

01:15:12.652 --> 01:15:14.152
Were you gonna mention this?

01:15:14.154 --> 01:15:15.587
Hmm, you didn't ask.

01:15:33.673 --> 01:15:35.874
I'm special agent John Henry fernack.

01:15:35.876 --> 01:15:38.010
You're gonna be okay, but you
cannot make a sound, okay?

01:15:39.712 --> 01:15:40.712
Okay?
- -Okay.

01:15:40.714 --> 01:15:41.713
Let's get this off you.

01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:48.954
This side, clear.

01:15:55.696 --> 01:15:57.029
Come here, you little bitch.

01:15:58.831 --> 01:16:01.099
The famous Templar family ring.

01:16:02.335 --> 01:16:03.969
Poor little Simon...

01:16:03.971 --> 01:16:08.340
His mommy and his daddy shot
dead right before his eyes.

01:16:10.043 --> 01:16:12.010
How do you know about that?

01:16:12.012 --> 01:16:14.646
How do you think valecross
got this in the first place?

01:16:15.982 --> 01:16:19.952
From the same man who shot
your mother and your father.

01:16:19.954 --> 01:16:21.186
It's the only me you're after.

01:16:22.889 --> 01:16:24.790
Leave my family out of this.

01:16:37.370 --> 01:16:40.872
First time my Dad brought
you home, I knew it.

01:16:40.874 --> 01:16:43.909
And you know something, it
feels good to be right.

01:16:43.911 --> 01:16:45.377
- Shut up.
- Well, well.

01:16:45.379 --> 01:16:48.280
Isn't this a morning full of surprises?

01:16:48.282 --> 01:16:52.117
What's so surprising about a gold-digger
killing her husband for his money?

01:17:01.995 --> 01:17:03.662
Katherine, really?

01:17:33.426 --> 01:17:36.294
That's why I have three guns.

01:17:43.970 --> 01:17:45.437
Time to leave.

01:17:45.439 --> 01:17:47.239
It's over, Marius. Let the girl go.

01:17:48.441 --> 01:17:50.876
Saving the girl won't
bring your parents back.

01:18:03.756 --> 01:18:04.756
Who killed them?

01:18:05.825 --> 01:18:07.159
Who killed my parents?

01:18:08.161 --> 01:18:10.829
You, Simon Templar,

01:18:10.831 --> 01:18:13.098
are just a pawn in a bigger game.

01:18:17.905 --> 01:18:20.238
How you doing?

01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:24.209
She just used him. Took him
for everything he had.

01:18:24.211 --> 01:18:27.713
You should know, your father
was a very brave man.

01:18:27.715 --> 01:18:29.181
He risked his life trying to return money

01:18:29.183 --> 01:18:31.149
stolen from people who desperately need it.

01:18:31.151 --> 01:18:33.485
If you like you can finish what he started.

01:18:33.487 --> 01:18:35.721
Just press enter and the
money will be returned

01:18:35.723 --> 01:18:37.022
to those who need it most.

01:18:46.466 --> 01:18:47.733
You'll be okay.

01:18:49.502 --> 01:18:50.502
Thank you.

01:18:54.073 --> 01:18:55.741
Say goodbye to your boyfriend.

01:18:59.078 --> 01:19:01.513
I still love him. I'll get him out.

01:19:01.515 --> 01:19:03.849
Actually, you won't.

01:19:06.452 --> 01:19:08.019
Templar.

01:19:11.891 --> 01:19:12.858
Templar?

01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:14.793
Templar?

01:19:25.947 --> 01:19:27.206
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:19:27.207 --> 01:19:31.510
this is all the information
we have at this time.

01:19:31.512 --> 01:19:34.312
- Um, Mr. president.
- President ibaka...

01:19:34.314 --> 01:19:38.316
Do you know any detail surrounding the
missing funds' sudden reappearance?

01:19:38.318 --> 01:19:40.952
I don't know where this money vanished to,

01:19:40.954 --> 01:19:42.854
or where it came back from.

01:19:42.856 --> 01:19:46.925
But right now, all I care
about is using these funds

01:19:46.927 --> 01:19:51.530
to help my fellow countrymen devastated
by this horrible catastrophe.

01:19:56.069 --> 01:19:57.903
Come on, come on.

01:20:17.123 --> 01:20:19.825
I was expecting your call.

01:20:19.827 --> 01:20:23.562
Too bad your thug Marius
failed in his endeavors.

01:20:23.564 --> 01:20:25.030
He's not my thug.

01:20:25.032 --> 01:20:27.165
Your man recommended him for the job.

01:20:27.167 --> 01:20:29.134
Look, we can lay blame later on.

01:20:29.136 --> 01:20:31.469
Right now, I need help
disappearing for a while.

01:20:31.471 --> 01:20:34.606
You can try, but you better hurry.

01:20:34.608 --> 01:20:38.343
You are not leaving me to
take the fall for this.

01:20:38.345 --> 01:20:40.846
I'm sorry but the brotherhood has decided.

01:21:27.059 --> 01:21:28.493
My compliments.

01:21:28.495 --> 01:21:31.229
It's taken me an unusually
long time to find you.

01:21:33.299 --> 01:21:34.966
Hyah! Hyah!

01:21:50.449 --> 01:21:51.549
Looking for this.

01:21:56.155 --> 01:21:57.355
I'm getting too old for this.

01:22:00.193 --> 01:22:03.528
Hello, Simon. It's been a while.

01:22:03.530 --> 01:22:05.597
I have someone - I want you to meet.

01:22:05.599 --> 01:22:07.666
Someone very special. His name is Xander.

01:22:11.370 --> 01:22:13.338
- Xander.
- Heh.

01:22:18.577 --> 01:22:20.211
Take whatever you want.

01:22:22.348 --> 01:22:25.684
Jewelry, silverware... We don't
have any money in the house.

01:22:27.987 --> 01:22:32.724
You, of all people, should know that
money is the motivator of lesser minds.

01:22:40.533 --> 01:22:43.468
And what motivates the brotherhood?
World peace?

01:22:43.470 --> 01:22:45.370
So smug.

01:22:45.372 --> 01:22:48.139
So holier than thou.

01:22:48.141 --> 01:22:51.076
But a Templar is just a
crusader by another name.

01:22:56.048 --> 01:22:59.751
We too have a holy cause.

01:22:59.753 --> 01:23:03.655
To wipe every last Templar

01:23:03.657 --> 01:23:05.423
from the face of the earth.

01:23:07.259 --> 01:23:09.294
It's only me you're after.

01:23:09.296 --> 01:23:11.997
Leave my family, my wife, out of this.

01:24:38.117 --> 01:24:41.086
My father asked you for
mercy, not for himself,

01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:43.121
for his family.

01:24:43.789 --> 01:24:45.256
And you gave him none.

01:24:47.726 --> 01:24:50.595
I'm glad it's you, Simon.
It ought to be you.

01:24:50.597 --> 01:24:52.197
But there's more than just me out there.

01:24:52.199 --> 01:24:54.432
The brotherhood will be coming after you.

01:24:54.434 --> 01:24:56.501
I'll worry about that when you're dead.

01:25:14.287 --> 01:25:16.154
You can't do it.

01:25:16.156 --> 01:25:18.690
You're still a little boy
concerned with "honor."

01:25:20.759 --> 01:25:22.160
I'm no assassin.

01:25:23.729 --> 01:25:25.163
I'm a Templar.

01:25:25.165 --> 01:25:26.898
You're weak. Like your father.

01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:27.899
He wasn't weak.

01:25:29.835 --> 01:25:31.336
He welcomed you into his home

01:25:31.871 --> 01:25:33.238
and you betrayed him.

01:25:34.507 --> 01:25:36.241
But I'd rather be "weak,"

01:25:37.643 --> 01:25:39.144
than whatever it is you are.

01:25:47.686 --> 01:25:49.921
Good luck, Xander. You're gonna need it.

01:25:54.727 --> 01:25:57.428
You do understand, don't you,

01:25:57.430 --> 01:26:00.231
that with one phone call, I won't
spend a single day in jail.

01:26:01.233 --> 01:26:02.634
We'll see.

01:26:02.636 --> 01:26:04.302
Hands up. You're under arrest.

01:26:05.237 --> 01:26:07.338
Special agent Cooper. FBI.

01:26:08.507 --> 01:26:11.609
Agent Cooper. Pleasure to see you again.

01:26:11.611 --> 01:26:13.211
Wish I could say the same.

01:26:14.246 --> 01:26:16.281
I see you've brought a friend with you.

01:26:16.283 --> 01:26:19.417
Yes, this is my associate, agent Dora Lee.

01:26:19.419 --> 01:26:21.252
Based just on what I've tapped into

01:26:21.254 --> 01:26:23.855
during his file transfers
in the last half an hour,

01:26:23.857 --> 01:26:27.258
he's got enough connections to
terror groups and suspect funds

01:26:27.260 --> 01:26:30.595
to keep homeland security
busy for a long time.

01:26:30.597 --> 01:26:34.299
What are the charges? -What makes you
think we're charging you with anything?

01:26:34.301 --> 01:26:36.367
The us government just
wants to talk to you.

01:26:36.369 --> 01:26:41.806
Under national defense and authorization
act sections 1021 to 1022.

01:26:41.808 --> 01:26:46.978
Which authorizes the indefinite
detention of terrorism suspects.

01:26:46.980 --> 01:26:49.948
You see, we don't like to rush
into anything without the facts.

01:26:49.950 --> 01:26:53.885
Facts that could take a
long time to unearth.

01:26:54.420 --> 01:26:55.520
Yeah.

01:26:56.355 --> 01:26:57.488
And as for you, Mr. temp...

01:27:02.494 --> 01:27:03.528
Son of a...

01:27:06.332 --> 01:27:07.465
Take him away.

01:27:13.372 --> 01:27:14.606
Come on.

01:27:14.608 --> 01:27:16.941
One out of two criminal
masterminds isn't bad.

01:27:19.446 --> 01:27:23.348
I guess I should be glad that fernack did all
the leg work and then let me get the collar.

01:27:23.616 --> 01:27:24.616
Heh, yeah.
