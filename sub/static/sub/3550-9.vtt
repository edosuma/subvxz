WEBVTT

00:01.172 --> 00:03.134
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:03.134 --> 00:05.506
GABY MADE A DISCOVERY...
 OH! YOUR STOMACH
JUST KICKED ME.

00:05.506 --> 00:09.180
I WANT YOU TO RUN
THE MIAMI OFFICE.
 SO CARLOS PLAYED HARDBALL.

00:09.180 --> 00:12.183
YOU CAN'T FIRE ME
FOR BEING PREGNANT.
 I'M OFFERING YOU A PROMOTION.

00:12.183 --> 00:14.785
IF YOU CHOOSE TO TURN IT DOWN
AND QUIT INSTEAD,

00:14.785 --> 00:17.088
I CAN'T STOP YOU.
 KATHERINE BROKE DOWN.

00:17.088 --> 00:19.490
THE MAN I LOVE CHOSE YOU.
IT'S OVER.

00:19.490 --> 00:22.793
WHY HAS THIS BEEN
SO HARD ON ME?
 YOU LOVE HIM.

00:22.793 --> 00:26.797
I FOUND A WAY TO SPRING YOU
FROM THIS MARRIAGE.
 KARL MADE A PLAN.

00:26.797 --> 00:29.300
IF HE VIOLATES PAROLE BY
ASSOCIATING WITH A KNOWN FELON,

00:29.300 --> 00:31.632
THEY CAN REVOKE IT.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.304
ALL WE NEED TO DO IS GET SOME
EX-CON IN A ROOM WITH ORSON,

00:33.304 --> 00:35.606
TAKE SOME PICTURES,
AND IT'S BYE-BYE, ORSON.

00:35.606 --> 00:38.069
THAT'S PERFECT! AND THEN
HE'LL HAVE TO LET ME GO.

00:38.069 --> 00:40.771
NICK MADE A CALL.

00:40.771 --> 00:43.614
AGENT PADILLA?
I'M THINKING ABOUT COMING IN.

00:43.614 --> 00:46.547
AND EVIL...
 DID YOU FORGET SOMETHING?

00:46.547 --> 00:49.120
RETURNED TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
 WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:49.120 --> 00:51.322
(choking)

00:55.086 --> 00:59.130
(Mary Alice) HER NAME
WAS EMILY PORTSMITH,

00:59.130 --> 01:01.061
AND WORD OF HER DEATH

01:01.061 --> 01:04.295
SPREAD QUICKLY.

01:04.295 --> 01:09.300
YOU SEE,
EVERYONE IN TOWN KNEW EMILY.

01:09.300 --> 01:14.545
HER FAMILY WAS WELL KNOWN
AND RESPECTED,

01:14.545 --> 01:18.109
SHE'D BEEN POPULAR IN SCHOOL...

01:18.109 --> 01:20.080
(speaking inaudibly)

01:20.080 --> 01:25.386
AND HER CUSTOMERS
AT THE COFFEE SHOP ADORED HER.

01:25.386 --> 01:30.561
PEOPLE WERE SHOCKED
TO HEAR SHE'D BEEN MURDERED,

01:30.561 --> 01:34.094
MOSTLY BECAUSE
ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN

01:34.094 --> 01:39.099
HAD BEEN ATTACKED
JUST A FEW WEEKS BEFORE.

01:39.099 --> 01:43.874
YES, EVERYONE IN FAIRVIEW
NOW KNEW

01:43.874 --> 01:46.877
A KILLER
WAS WALKING AMONG THEM.

01:48.879 --> 01:51.382
AND THEY WOULD SOON LEARN...

01:52.843 --> 01:57.148
HE WASN'T FINISHED.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.632
THE NEXT DAY,

02:11.632 --> 02:13.904
THE WOMEN OF WISTERIA LANE
GOT TOGETHER

02:13.904 --> 02:16.607
FOR THEIR WEEKLY POKER GAME.

02:16.607 --> 02:20.471
BUT AS IT TURNED OUT, NO ONE
WAS IN THE MOOD TO GAMBLE.

02:20.471 --> 02:22.643
THE GIRL AT THE COFFEE SHOP
WAS STRANGLED,

02:22.643 --> 02:25.216
AND JULIE WAS ATTACKED
THE SAME WAY.

02:25.216 --> 02:28.879
THERE IS OBVIOUSLY
A MADMAN ON THE LOOSE.
 I'M AFRAID TO LEAVE MY HOUSE
AT NIGHT.

02:28.879 --> 02:31.151
AT LEAST NOW YOU HAVE
A BOYFRIEND TO PROTECT YOU.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.854
ROY? THE MAN THREW OUT HIS BACK
PEELING AN ORANGE.

02:33.854 --> 02:37.358
I'M ON MY OWN HERE.
 SO WHAT DO WE DO
TO PROTECT OURSELVES?

02:37.358 --> 02:39.360
DOWN AT THE HOSPITAL
WHERE I WORK,

02:39.360 --> 02:41.192
THEY OFFER
A SELF-DEFENSE CLASS.

02:41.192 --> 02:44.235
MAYBE WE SHOULD CONSIDER
TAKING THAT.
 (Karen) THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

02:44.235 --> 02:46.897
I GUESS WE COULD,
BUT YOU KNOW MY MOTTO--

02:46.897 --> 02:49.740
.38 SPECIAL
IS A GIRL'S BEST FRIEND.

02:49.740 --> 02:52.243
OOH, I LOVE THE PEARL HANDLE.

02:52.243 --> 02:54.545
IT WOULD LOOK SO GOOD
WITH MY WHITE SUIT.

02:54.545 --> 02:56.847
SUSAN, YOU SHOULD FEEL IT.
IT'S SO LIGHT.

02:56.847 --> 02:58.849
I DON'T TOUCH GUNS ANYMORE,

02:58.849 --> 03:01.612
NOT SINCE I ACCIDENTALLY
GRAZED KATHERINE.

03:01.612 --> 03:04.285
OH, STILL GOING WITH
"ACCIDENTALLY," ARE WE?

03:04.285 --> 03:05.956
(women chuckle)

03:05.956 --> 03:08.619
OH, HEY, HONEY. WE'RE ALL GONNA
TAKE A SELF-DEFENSE CLASS.

03:08.619 --> 03:10.621
YOU WANNA COME WITH US?

03:10.621 --> 03:13.394
YEAH. IT MIGHT
MAKE YOU FEEL SAFER.

03:13.394 --> 03:17.568
WELL... I WAS TAKING OUT
THE TRASH WHEN I WAS ATTACKED.

03:17.568 --> 03:19.570
HE CAME OUT OF NOWHERE,

03:19.570 --> 03:21.872
AND I BLACKED OUT BEFORE
I KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

03:23.874 --> 03:27.808
IF SOMEONE REALLY WANTS
TO GET YOU, THEY CAN GET YOU.

03:39.990 --> 03:43.254
I'M OFF. OH, YOU'RE SEWING
PENNY'S COSTUME?

03:43.254 --> 03:46.457
YEAH, BUT I'M READING
THE SPORTS PAGE WHILE DOING IT,

03:46.457 --> 03:48.599
SO THEY KINDA
CANCEL EACH OTHER OUT.

03:49.900 --> 03:53.233
OH... (clears throat)
AHEM, I GOT YOU THIS--

03:53.233 --> 03:54.905
A PRICEY BOURBON.

03:54.905 --> 03:56.967
IT'S 8:45 IN THE MORNING,
AND I'M PREGNANT.

03:56.967 --> 03:58.939
I THINK I'LL PASS.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.341
FOR CARLOS.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.873
IT'S A "SORRY I LIED
ABOUT BEING PREGNANT" GIFT.

04:02.873 --> 04:04.875
I DON'T NEED THAT.
I KNOW CARLOS.

04:04.875 --> 04:06.547
HE LOSES HIS TEMPER,

04:06.547 --> 04:08.549
THEN HE CALMS DOWN
AND THINKS RATIONALLY.

04:08.549 --> 04:11.251
GOOD-BYE. MWAH.
 I'D STILL BRING THE BOOZE.

04:11.251 --> 04:14.254
I'M TELLING YOU, I AM
TOO VALUABLE RIGHT WHERE I AM.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.027
THERE'S NO WAY HE'S GONNA
TRY AND SEND ME TO FLORIDA.

04:17.027 --> 04:20.260
(all) BON VOYAGE!

04:20.260 --> 04:21.661
WHAT'S GOING ON?

04:21.661 --> 04:23.964
CARLOS TOLD US ABOUT
THE PROMOTION IN FLORIDA.

04:23.964 --> 04:26.637
CONGRATULATIONS.

04:26.637 --> 04:27.938
(squeals)

04:27.938 --> 04:31.802
YOU ARE GOING TO BE SO MISSED
AROUND HERE!

04:34.605 --> 04:36.907
LYNETTE, WHERE YOU GOING?
RITA WROTE YOU A GOOD-BYE POEM.

04:36.907 --> 04:39.550
CAN I SEE YOU
IN MY OFFICE, PLEASE?

04:43.584 --> 04:45.586
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

04:45.586 --> 04:48.489
YOU KNOW I'M NOT MOVING
TO FLORIDA.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.961
OKAY, SO THEN WE JUST, UH,
CHANGE THE BANNER TO READ,

04:50.961 --> 04:53.924
"GOOD LUCK AND SO LONG."
 NO, IT NEEDS TO READ,

04:53.924 --> 04:57.628
"I TOLD YOU I'M NOT LEAVING.
SOMEONE GET ME A BAGEL."
 LYNETTE, WHAT CAN I TELL YOU?

04:57.628 --> 04:59.830
WE HAVE AN OPENING FOR YOU
IN OUR FLORIDA BRANCH.

04:59.830 --> 05:02.903
BUT HERE, YOUR JOB'S
ALREADY BEEN GIVEN TO TIM.

05:02.903 --> 05:05.936
WELL, TELL TIM
YOU MADE A MISTAKE.
 I CAN'T DO THAT.

05:05.936 --> 05:08.809
SO I GUESS THIS LEAVES YOU
NO CHOICE BUT TO QUIT.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.882
LOOK, I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING,
AND I AM NOT GOING FOR IT.

05:11.882 --> 05:14.885
YOU WANT ME GONE,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIRE ME.

05:14.885 --> 05:17.988
AND OPEN MYSELF UP TO A LAWSUIT
BY FIRING A PREGNANT WOMAN?

05:17.988 --> 05:20.451
I DON'T THINK SO.

05:20.451 --> 05:23.654
THEN IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I HAVE WORK TO DO.

05:23.654 --> 05:25.556
HEY.

05:25.556 --> 05:27.027
THESE AREN'T MY KIDS.

05:27.027 --> 05:29.960
NO. THOSE... (chuckles)
ARE TIM'S KIDS.

05:29.960 --> 05:32.933
THIS IS HIS OFFICE NOW.

05:32.933 --> 05:35.506
SO...

05:35.506 --> 05:37.508
WHAT OFFICE WILL I BE USING?

05:43.574 --> 05:45.576
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

05:45.576 --> 05:48.949
THESE TWINS HAVE
A BIGGER OFFICE.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.080
ENJOY.

05:53.424 --> 05:55.926
(knock on door)

05:55.926 --> 05:57.658
HOW YOU DOING?

05:57.658 --> 06:00.731
I'M OKAY.

06:00.731 --> 06:02.933
EVERYBODY SEEMS TO THINK
WHOEVER KILLED EMILY

06:02.933 --> 06:06.036
WAS PROBABLY THE SAME PERSON
WHO ATTACKED ME.

06:06.036 --> 06:08.539
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
THE POLICE ARE SAYING.

06:11.542 --> 06:15.676
AND I THINK THAT WE SHOULD DO
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HELP THEM.

06:17.748 --> 06:19.079
MEANING WHAT?

06:19.079 --> 06:21.081
MAYBE NOW IS THE TIME

06:21.081 --> 06:22.983
TO TELL THEM ABOUT
THE MARRIED MAN YOU WERE SEEING.

06:22.983 --> 06:26.056
HE HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.
 YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

06:26.056 --> 06:28.158
MEN WHO CHEAT SOMETIMES HAVE
MORE THAN ONE GIRLFRIEND.

06:28.158 --> 06:31.121
MOM, LISTEN. THERE IS NO WAY
HE COULD EVER HURT SOMEONE,

06:31.121 --> 06:32.993
MUCH LESS KILL THEM.

06:35.125 --> 06:36.527
(sighs deeply)

06:36.527 --> 06:38.028
OKAY.

06:38.028 --> 06:40.571
(whispers) IF YOU'RE SURE.

06:40.571 --> 06:42.933
I AM. I MEAN... (sighs)

06:42.933 --> 06:45.936
WHY WOULD HE ATTACK ME AND THEN
WANNA GET BACK TOGETHER?

06:45.936 --> 06:49.710
WAIT. HAVE YOU STARTED
SEEING HIM AGAIN?

06:49.710 --> 06:50.741
NO.

06:50.741 --> 06:52.182
JULIE...
 EVEN IF I DID,

06:52.182 --> 06:54.114
IT IS MY LIFE, RIGHT?

06:57.988 --> 07:00.721
THAT'S RIGHT.
IT IS YOUR LIFE.

07:03.494 --> 07:04.955
IS IT JUST ME,

07:04.955 --> 07:07.998
OR WAS LIFE MUCH LESS
COMPLICATED WHEN YOU WERE 7?

07:10.861 --> 07:12.803
SORRY I GREW UP.

07:12.803 --> 07:15.966
ME, TOO.

07:21.812 --> 07:23.474
POLICE ARE CONCERNED

07:23.474 --> 07:25.576
THAT THE STRANGLING
OF PORTSMITH

07:25.576 --> 07:27.578
IS CONNECTED
TO A SIMILAR ATTACK

07:27.578 --> 07:30.481
ON A FAIRVIEW WOMAN
EARLIER THIS YEAR.

07:30.481 --> 07:33.453
ANYONE WITH INFORMATION
IS BEING ASKED TO CALL--

07:33.453 --> 07:34.785
JUST THINK--

07:34.785 --> 07:36.987
IF THE COPS HADN'T WASTED
SO MUCH TIME ON DANNY,

07:36.987 --> 07:39.930
THEY MIGHT'VE CAUGHT THIS GUY
BEFORE HE DID THIS AGAIN, RIGHT?

07:42.493 --> 07:44.094
WHAT?

07:44.094 --> 07:47.097
I WAS THERE.

07:47.097 --> 07:49.199
YOU WERE WHERE?

07:49.199 --> 07:51.201
AT THE COFFEE SHOP.
 (object clatters)

07:51.201 --> 07:53.674
I GOT THERE RIGHT WHEN
THAT GIRL WAS CLOSING UP.

07:53.674 --> 07:56.146
OH, PLEASE BE KIDDING.
 NAH, I WISH I WAS.

07:56.146 --> 07:58.979
AND I'M PRETTY SURE
I WAS HER LAST CUSTOMER.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.512
BUT DID ANYBODY SEE YOU?

08:01.512 --> 08:04.014
NO, I DON'T THINK SO,
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN

08:04.014 --> 08:07.057
THE COPS WON'T FIGURE OUT THAT
I WAS THERE. AND IF THEY DO...

08:07.057 --> 08:09.059
YEAH, THEY'RE GONNA WANNA
COME AND TALK TO YOU AGAIN

08:09.059 --> 08:11.522
A-AND MAYBE RUN YOUR PRINTS.

08:11.522 --> 08:13.524
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
I WAS THINKING.

08:15.265 --> 08:17.067
I WAS ALSO THINKING

08:17.067 --> 08:20.070
THAT MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T
WAIT AROUND FOR THAT TO HAPPEN.

08:20.070 --> 08:22.032
NO. I'M NOT MOVING AGAIN.
N-NOT THIS TIME.

08:22.032 --> 08:24.535
LOOK, ANGIE--ANGE--ANGE,
WILL YOU JUST LET ME FINISH?

08:24.535 --> 08:26.537
NO, NO, NO, NICK,
I LIKE THIS PLACE!

08:26.537 --> 08:28.579
I HAVE FRIENDS.
I HAVE A JOB.

08:28.579 --> 08:30.981
I-I-I-I FEEL LIKE
A REAL PERSON HERE AGAIN.

08:30.981 --> 08:34.784
AFTER 18 YEARS OF BEING A GHOST,
I-I DON'T WANNA GIVE THAT UP.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.990
FINE.

08:39.990 --> 08:42.693
(exhales deeply) ALL RIGHT,
MAYBE WE'LL GET LUCKY,

08:42.693 --> 08:44.695
AND THE COPS
JUST WON'T COME.

08:44.695 --> 08:46.156
BUT HONESTLY,

08:46.156 --> 08:49.660
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH MORE LUCK
WE GOT LEFT.

08:52.062 --> 08:55.065
(baby crying,
dog barking in distance)

08:56.967 --> 08:59.169
HEY.
 (chuckles nervously)

08:59.169 --> 09:02.042
(siren wailing in distance)

09:05.075 --> 09:06.577
(sighs)

09:14.625 --> 09:16.126
HELLO.

09:16.126 --> 09:18.128
ARE YOU LAMAR BENJAMIN?

09:18.128 --> 09:20.560
YOU GOT A WARRANT?

09:20.560 --> 09:23.563
OH, NO, I'M NOT WITH THE POLICE.
MY NAME IS BREE HODGE.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.136
YOU KNOW MY HUSBAND ORSON
FROM THE STATE PENITENTIARY.

09:26.136 --> 09:29.099
DO YOU HAVE A MOMENT?

09:29.099 --> 09:31.772
I GOT NOTHING BUT MOMENTS.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.073
(chuckles)

09:41.211 --> 09:44.715
SO YOU'RE MRS. HODGE?

09:44.715 --> 09:46.116
DAMN.

09:46.116 --> 09:48.118
FLOSSY DID OKAY FOR HISSELF.

09:48.118 --> 09:49.760
UH, "FLOSSY"?

09:49.760 --> 09:51.762
THAT'S WHAT WE CALLED ORSON

09:51.762 --> 09:53.764
'CAUSE HE GOT US ALL
DENTAL FLOSS

09:53.764 --> 09:55.966
AND THEN NAGGED US TO USE IT
AFTER EVERY MEAL.

09:55.966 --> 09:57.968
(chuckles) I SEE.
 PAIN IN THE ASS.

09:57.968 --> 10:00.270
I WAS GLAD WHEN SOMEBODY USED IT
TO STRANGLE A GUARD,

10:00.270 --> 10:02.302
AND THEY TOOK IT ALL AWAY.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.104
(can fizzes)

10:04.104 --> 10:06.076
SO HOW'S ORSON DOING?

10:06.076 --> 10:09.079
WELL, UH, TO BE HONEST,
LAMAR,

10:09.079 --> 10:12.082
LIFE ON THE OUTSIDE'S
BEEN A LITTLE HARD FOR HIM.

10:12.082 --> 10:15.946
PEOPLE CAN BE SO JUDGMENTAL
ABOUT MEN WHO HAVE SERVED TIME.

10:15.946 --> 10:19.119
AND IF YOU'RE A REPEAT OFFENDER,
YOU CAN FORGET IT.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.350
YES.

10:20.350 --> 10:22.222
WELL... (chuckles)

10:22.222 --> 10:25.055
I'VE HEARD ORSON SPEAK VERY
FONDLY OF HIS PRISON FRIENDS,

10:25.055 --> 10:27.758
ESPECIALLY YOU.

10:27.758 --> 10:28.929
REALLY?

10:28.929 --> 10:30.931
'CAUSE HE SEEMED KIND OF MAD

10:30.931 --> 10:33.934
AFTER I USED HIM AS A SHIELD
IN THAT YARD FIGHT.

10:33.934 --> 10:37.167
LAMAR, HE JUST TELLS THAT STORY
NOW AND LAUGHS AND LAUGHS.

10:37.167 --> 10:39.269
(laughs)

10:39.269 --> 10:42.172
ANYWAY, HE'S BEEN FEELING
A LITTLE BLUE,

10:42.172 --> 10:45.175
AND I WAS HOPING YOU WOULD PAY
HIM A VISIT AND CHEER HIM UP.

10:45.175 --> 10:48.719
SORRY.
I'D BE BREAKING MY PAROLE.

10:48.719 --> 10:50.821
THEY CATCH ME HANGING OUT
WITH OTHER EX-CONS,

10:50.821 --> 10:53.353
THEY CAN SEND ME
BACK TO JAIL.

10:53.353 --> 10:55.355
REALLY? WELL,
THAT'S A SILLY RULE.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.227
DON'T WORRY, THOUGH.

10:57.227 --> 11:00.090
OUR HOUSE IS ON THE END
OF A VERY QUIET CUL-DE-SAC.

11:00.090 --> 11:02.162
NO ONE WOULD EVEN KNOW
YOU STOPPED BY.

11:04.034 --> 11:06.737
AND, OF COURSE,
I WOULD COMPENSATE YOU...

11:08.739 --> 11:10.440
FOR YOUR TIME.

11:15.345 --> 11:18.709
AND ANOTHER 3
WHEN YOU COME.

11:18.709 --> 11:21.211
WHAT THE HELL?

11:22.783 --> 11:24.885
NO HARM
IN A LITTLE SOCIAL CALL.

11:26.256 --> 11:29.689
BUT YOU CAN'T TELL ANYBODY
I CAME.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.192
WHEN YOU GET
TO KNOW ME BETTER, LAMAR,

11:32.192 --> 11:34.224
YOU'LL FIND I HAVE
NO TROUBLE...

11:34.224 --> 11:35.726
(whispers)
KEEPING SECRETS.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.911
HEY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

11:50.911 --> 11:52.913
YOUR MOM TOLD ME
YOU WERE UPSET.

11:52.913 --> 11:55.385
I TOLD HER I KNEW HOW
TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

11:55.385 --> 11:57.117
MINT CHOCOLATE CHIP?

11:57.117 --> 11:58.248
THANKS, DADDY.

11:58.248 --> 12:01.051
I KNOW THIS ONE'S GONNA TAKE
A LOT MORE THAN ICE CREAM.

12:01.051 --> 12:04.094
I KEEP THINKING ABOUT HIM.

12:04.094 --> 12:06.096
HE'S OUT THERE, AND...

12:06.096 --> 12:08.098
MAYBE HE'S THINKING
ABOUT ME.

12:08.098 --> 12:10.300
HONEY, HONEY, HE'S NOT.

12:10.300 --> 12:13.403
HE KNOWS WHERE I LIVE. HE KNOWS
WHAT KIND OF CAR I DRIVE.

12:13.403 --> 12:16.106
I'VE BEEN WANTING TO GO
TO THE LIBRARY,

12:16.106 --> 12:19.309
BUT I'M AFRAID
HE'S GONNA FOLLOW ME.
 LOOK, IF YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT YOUR CAR,

12:19.309 --> 12:23.013
WHY DON'T WE SWITCH
FOR A WHILE?
 SERIOUSLY?
I'D DRIVE YOUR FANCY CAR,

12:23.013 --> 12:25.475
AND YOU'D DRIVE
MY TINY, LITTLE COMPACT?

12:25.475 --> 12:28.518
HEY, THERE'S NOTHING
I WOULD NOT DO FOR MY LITTLE...

12:28.518 --> 12:30.520
YOU HAVE
AIR CONDITIONING, RIGHT?

12:32.282 --> 12:35.255
YEAH, THERE'S NOTHING I WOULDN'T
DO FOR MY LITTLE GIRL.

12:47.437 --> 12:48.999
YOU OKAY?

12:48.999 --> 12:53.073
I'M JUST HAVING A BAD DAY.

12:53.073 --> 12:55.775
MY LIFE
HAS GOTTEN SORT OF...

12:55.775 --> 12:57.147
COMPLICATED.

12:57.147 --> 12:59.209
WHY?

12:59.209 --> 13:03.253
OH, IT'S...
GROWN-UP RELATIONSHIP STUFF.

13:03.253 --> 13:04.955
YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

13:04.955 --> 13:07.087
OKAY.

13:07.087 --> 13:08.959
BUT...

13:10.490 --> 13:13.093
SINCE YOU ASKED...

13:15.195 --> 13:19.499
SO I THINK YOU'RE REALLY GONNA
HAVE FUN AT BRANDON'S PARTY.

13:19.499 --> 13:22.572
I HEARD THERE'S GONNA
BE A PONY.

13:22.572 --> 13:24.274
HEY, YOU OKAY?

13:24.274 --> 13:27.237
I'M WORRIED
ABOUT MRS. MAYFAIR.

13:27.237 --> 13:29.179
WHY?

13:29.179 --> 13:31.181
SHE'S NOT GETTING
ANY YOUNGER,

13:31.181 --> 13:34.344
AND IT'S REALLY HARD
TO MEET GUYS IN THIS TOWN.

13:34.344 --> 13:37.287
(laughs)
WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT?

13:37.287 --> 13:39.249
SHE TOLD ME.

13:39.249 --> 13:41.391
SHE ALSO SAID

13:41.391 --> 13:43.423
MOMMY STOLE YOU FROM HER,

13:43.423 --> 13:46.256
AND THAT MAKES MOMMY
A BAD PERSON.

13:49.429 --> 13:52.062
BUDDY...

13:52.062 --> 13:54.064
YOUR MOMMY IS A GREAT PERSON.

13:54.064 --> 13:57.137
NOW WHY YOU, UH,
SIGN BRANDON'S CARD, OKAY?

13:57.137 --> 13:59.439
AND, UH, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

14:07.577 --> 14:09.319
MIKE, WATCH IT.

14:09.319 --> 14:12.052
DID YOU ACTUALLY TELL
MY 6-YEAR-OLD SON

14:12.052 --> 14:14.885
THAT HIS MOTHER'S
A BAD PERSON?

14:16.957 --> 14:20.390
WELL, I WOULD'VE USED
MORE COLORFUL LANGUAGE,

14:20.390 --> 14:23.433
BUT LIKE YOU SAID,
HE'S ONLY 6.

14:23.433 --> 14:27.197
YOU'VE NEVER REALLY
SEEN ME GET ANGRY.

14:27.197 --> 14:29.199
BUT IF YOU WANT TO,

14:29.199 --> 14:31.902
JUST TALK TO MY SON
ONE MORE TIME.

14:33.443 --> 14:36.276
THEN YOU'LL KNOW
WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF.

14:38.979 --> 14:41.211
MIKE.

14:41.211 --> 14:44.654
I LOVE M.J. I-I-I WOULD NEVER
DO ANYTHING TO HURT HIM.

14:44.654 --> 14:47.487
ONE MORE TIME.

14:52.422 --> 14:56.166
(horns honking in distance)

15:01.031 --> 15:02.202
(gasps)

15:02.202 --> 15:05.375
OH, JULIE. (sighs)

15:05.375 --> 15:07.177
NO!

15:10.410 --> 15:14.044
(cell phone vibrates)

15:14.044 --> 15:15.185
HELLO?

15:15.185 --> 15:17.687
HI. IT'S YOUR MOTHER.

15:17.687 --> 15:19.619
AM I INTERRUPTING ANYTHING?

15:19.619 --> 15:21.952
NOPE.
I'M JUST AT THE LIBRARY.

15:21.952 --> 15:25.325
OH, REALLY. THE LIBRARY.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.497
YEAH. I THOUGHT I'D DIVE
INTO AN OLD FAVORITE.

15:27.497 --> 15:30.160
AND VICE VERSA, I'M SURE.

15:30.160 --> 15:33.263
HUH?
 Honey, I don't blame you.

15:33.263 --> 15:36.266
YOU'VE GONE BACK TO THAT PLACE
BECAUSE IT SEEMS...

15:36.266 --> 15:38.508
SAFE AND COMFORTING.
AM I RIGHT?

15:38.508 --> 15:41.271
I GUESS.

15:41.271 --> 15:44.944
BUT TRUST ME,
IT'S A BAD IDEA.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.946
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THIS LATER?

15:46.946 --> 15:49.279
I ONLY HAVE AN HOUR,
AND I REALLY WANNA FINISH.

15:49.279 --> 15:51.951
OKAY, I WANT YOU OUT OF THERE
RIGHT NOW!

15:51.951 --> 15:54.524
MOM, I'LL SEE YOU SOON.
 (beep)

15:54.524 --> 15:57.257
YOU BET YOU WILL.

15:59.529 --> 16:02.032
YOU'VE BEEN A BUSY GIRL.

16:02.032 --> 16:04.034
YOU GOT THE EX-CON BOOKED,

16:04.034 --> 16:06.566
HIDDEN CAMERAS ALL SET UP.

16:06.566 --> 16:08.438
COME FRIDAY NIGHT...

16:08.438 --> 16:10.640
SHOWTIME.

16:12.202 --> 16:14.204
SO WHAT'S THE MATTER?

16:14.204 --> 16:16.476
WE SHOULD BE CELEBRATING.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.478
I JUST HOPE
WE'RE BOTH CLEAR

16:18.478 --> 16:21.281
THAT THESE PHOTOS
ARE STRICTLY FOR BLACKMAIL.

16:21.281 --> 16:24.084
OF COURSE. WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY
GONNA SEND HIM TO PRISON.

16:24.084 --> 16:27.187
UNLESS, I MEAN, WE HAVE TO.
 NO, KARL.

16:27.187 --> 16:30.160
EVEN IF HE CALLS OUR BLUFF,
WE ARE NOT GONNA TURN HIM IN.

16:34.294 --> 16:36.626
EXCUSE ME. UM,
I'M LOOKING FOR THE PERSON

16:36.626 --> 16:38.668
THAT BELONGS
TO THE LITTLE BLUE CAR.

16:38.668 --> 16:41.371
SHE'S A REDHEAD.
 WITH A MAN?

16:41.371 --> 16:45.235
YEAH, SHE'S WITH A MAN.
THE REDHEAD'S MY DAUGHTER.

16:45.235 --> 16:47.707
YOUR DAUGHTER? DAMN.

16:47.707 --> 16:50.340
YOU LOOK GOOD.
 THANK YOU.

16:50.340 --> 16:52.742
SO CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT ROOM THEY'RE IN?

16:55.285 --> 16:57.287
I MAY NOT LOVE HIM ANYMORE,

16:57.287 --> 17:01.591
BUT I'M NOT GONNA WIN MY FREEDOM
BY TAKING AWAY HIS.

17:01.591 --> 17:04.094
NOW YOU'RE ANGRY.

17:04.094 --> 17:06.096
BREE, WHEN YOU TELL ME

17:06.096 --> 17:09.098
YOU COULD NEVER HURT
A MAN YOU USED TO LOVE,

17:09.098 --> 17:11.300
IT DOESN'T MAKE ME ANGRY.

17:11.300 --> 17:14.263
IT JUST REMINDS ME
WHY I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

17:14.263 --> 17:16.736
DON'T YOU WORRY.

17:16.736 --> 17:18.738
NO ONE'S GONNA GET HURT.

17:22.372 --> 17:25.575
(gasps)

17:25.575 --> 17:27.277
(whispers) OH, MY GOD!

17:27.277 --> 17:30.049
OH, MY GOD!

17:38.388 --> 17:41.391
HEY, ERIC. CAN YOU TELL CARLOS
I'M HERE FOR LUNCH?

17:41.391 --> 17:43.533
I'M GONNA RUN
TO THE LADIES' ROOM.

17:43.533 --> 17:46.065
I'LL TELL HIM.

17:46.065 --> 17:50.140
(pencil sharpener whirring)

17:50.140 --> 17:51.801
(telephone rings)

17:51.801 --> 17:54.444
HI, LYNETTE.

17:54.444 --> 17:56.206
HI, GABY.

17:56.206 --> 17:58.208
I'D ASK YOU IN,
BUT I DON'T THINK

17:58.208 --> 18:01.281
THERE'S ENOUGH OXYGEN IN HERE
FOR THE BOTH OF US.

18:01.281 --> 18:03.553
NO, IT'S, UH... COMFY.

18:05.285 --> 18:06.786
(clears throat)

18:06.786 --> 18:09.219
HEY.

18:09.219 --> 18:11.261
I GET THAT CARLOS
IS TRYING TO PUNISH ME.

18:11.261 --> 18:14.364
BUT ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.
YOU GOTTA TALK TO HIM.

18:14.364 --> 18:17.367
LYNETTE, YOU NEVER EVEN CAME TO
ME TO TELL ME YOU WERE PREGNANT.

18:17.367 --> 18:20.370
I THINK THIS IS BETWEEN
YOU AND CARLOS.
 OKAY, I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET,

18:20.370 --> 18:23.203
BUT ME KEEPING MY PREGNANCY
SECRET WASN'T PERSONAL.
 WASN'T IT?

18:23.203 --> 18:26.206
NO. LISTEN TO ME.
TOM AND I ARE STILL IN DEBT.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.708
I NEEDED THIS PROMOTION,
AND CARLOS HAD ALREADY

18:28.708 --> 18:31.241
PASSED OVER A COWORKER
 BECAUSE SHE WAS PREGNANT.

18:31.241 --> 18:33.343
I COULDN'T RISK
YOUR TELLING HIM.

18:33.343 --> 18:36.446
OH, BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT I'D
TELL CARLOS, AND HE'D FIRE YOU.

18:36.446 --> 18:38.188
YES.

18:38.188 --> 18:41.351
SO CLEARLY I WASN'T ENOUGH
OF A FRIEND FOR YOU TO TRUST ME.

18:41.351 --> 18:43.653
N-NO.
 BUT NOW I'M SUCH A GOOD FRIEND.

18:43.653 --> 18:46.656
I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN FIX IT FOR YOU?

18:46.656 --> 18:49.229
I'M GUESSING YOU'RE NOT GONNA
TALK TO CARLOS.

18:49.229 --> 18:50.760
GOOD GUESS.

18:56.806 --> 19:00.810
(sharpener whirring)

19:06.676 --> 19:09.749
I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE'S DEAD.

19:09.749 --> 19:12.282
I JUST SAW HER
A FEW DAYS AGO.

19:12.282 --> 19:14.224
WE TALKED ABOUT
GOING TO THE MALL.

19:14.224 --> 19:15.855
WHO FOUND HER?

19:15.855 --> 19:17.527
THE ASSISTANT MANAGER.

19:17.527 --> 19:20.430
I WAS LATE YESTERDAY.
I MEAN, THANK GOD.

19:20.430 --> 19:22.592
IT WOULD'VE FREAKED ME OUT.

19:22.592 --> 19:24.794
HEY.
 HI.

19:24.794 --> 19:27.597
WE WERE JUST TALKING
ABOUT EMILY.

19:27.597 --> 19:29.599
YEAH, I DIDN'T REALLY
KNOW HER,

19:29.599 --> 19:32.342
BUT I GUESS
WE'RE SORT OF CONNECTED NOW.

19:32.342 --> 19:35.205
YOU WOULD'VE LIKED HER.
SHE WAS SUPER NICE.

19:35.205 --> 19:36.676
I GOTTA GO HOME.

19:36.676 --> 19:39.679
MY MOM'S SO FREAKED OUT
THAT THIS COULD'VE BEEN ME,

19:39.679 --> 19:43.553
SHE WANTS ME AROUND.
 I'LL GIVE YOU A RIDE.

19:43.553 --> 19:46.916
WE SHOULD GO, TOO, DANNY.
 UH, NO, YOU GO AHEAD.

19:46.916 --> 19:49.489
BUT...
DON'T YOU NEED A RIDE?

19:49.489 --> 19:52.191
UH, NAH, I'LL WALK.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.324
I JUST WANNA TALK TO JULIE.

20:03.633 --> 20:06.736
(sighs) SO YOU WANNA
GET SOMETHING TO EAT?

20:06.736 --> 20:09.479
THANKS, BUT I'M NOT HUNGRY.

20:09.479 --> 20:12.912
WELL, MAYBE YOU WANNA
GO TO EMILY'S FUNERAL TOGETHER?

20:12.912 --> 20:14.414
EVERYBODY'S GOING.

20:14.414 --> 20:16.346
DANNY...

20:16.346 --> 20:18.348
I KNOW YOU LIKE ME,

20:18.348 --> 20:20.650
BUT I CAN'T
HANG OUT WITH YOU.

20:20.650 --> 20:22.452
WHY NOT?

20:22.452 --> 20:24.394
I JUST CAN'T.

20:24.394 --> 20:26.656
IT'S COMPLICATED.

20:26.656 --> 20:31.361
IT'S 'CAUSE YOU SLEPT
WITH MY DAD, ISN'T IT?

20:31.361 --> 20:33.333
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

20:33.333 --> 20:37.307
I FIGURED OUT A WHILE AGO.
 IF YOU KNOW THAT,

20:37.307 --> 20:41.711
THEN WHY IN THE WORLD
WOULD YOU STILL--
 BECAUSE I LIKE YOU!

20:41.711 --> 20:43.413
A LOT.

20:44.914 --> 20:47.417
DO YOU NOT SEE
HOW WEIRD THAT IS?

20:47.417 --> 20:51.921
NO, IT'S--IT'S OKAY
'CAUSE I'VE FORGIVEN YOU.

20:51.921 --> 20:55.685
THAT'S--THAT'S NICE,

20:55.685 --> 20:58.928
BUT IT'S STILL WEIRD.

20:58.928 --> 21:00.530
JULIE, P--

21:00.530 --> 21:02.532
PLEASE, I WANNA BE WITH YOU.

21:02.532 --> 21:04.534
DANNY, I AM SO SORRY,

21:04.534 --> 21:07.997
BUT THAT IS NEVER
GOING TO HAPPEN.

21:39.569 --> 21:41.431
(sighs)

21:41.431 --> 21:43.433
COME ON, IF THEY'RE GONNA COME,
THEY'RE GONNA COME.

21:43.433 --> 21:46.436
I FEEL LIKE I SPENT MY ENTIRE
LIFE LOOKING OUT WINDOWS.

21:46.436 --> 21:47.937
YEAH.

21:51.641 --> 21:55.385
MAYBE IT'S TIME WE STOP.

21:56.886 --> 21:58.848
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

21:58.848 --> 22:02.392
I'M SAYING MAYBE IT'S TIME
WE THOUGHT ABOUT COMING IN.

22:02.392 --> 22:06.496
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU DIDN'T TALK TO THEM.

22:06.496 --> 22:09.759
OH, MY GOD!
 ALL RIGHT. CALM DOWN,
ALL RIGHT? I'M NOT AN IDIOT.

22:09.759 --> 22:12.362
I USED A PREPAID, AND THE CALL
LASTED LESS THAN A MINUTE.

22:12.362 --> 22:15.064
THERE'S NO WAY
THEY'RE EVER GONNA FIND US.
 BUT STILL,
THEY KNOW WE'RE ALIVE!

22:15.064 --> 22:18.568
(Nick) DON'T YOU WANNA KNOW
IF THEY'RE READY TO MAKE A DEAL?
 I KILLED A MAN.

22:18.568 --> 22:21.571
THEY'LL BE READY TO MAKE A DEAL
WHEN I GOT A NEEDLE IN MY ARM

22:21.571 --> 22:24.774
AND MY EYES ARE
ROLLED BACK IN MY HEAD!
 COME ON, YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

22:24.774 --> 22:27.777
YOU ARE NEVER TALKING
TO THEM AGAIN! DO YOU HEAR ME?

22:30.980 --> 22:34.123
I STILL CAN'T GET THAT IMAGE
OF LYNETTE OUT OF MY HEAD.

22:34.123 --> 22:36.826
THE ONLY THING MISSING
IN THAT CRAMPED LITTLE OFFICE

22:36.826 --> 22:39.088
WAS A HAMSTER WHEEL
AND WOOD CHIPS.

22:39.088 --> 22:41.791
YEAH, I FIGURE
A COUPLE MORE DAYS OF THIS,

22:41.791 --> 22:44.494
SHE'LL BE READY
TO PACK HER THINGS.

22:46.436 --> 22:48.598
SHE DOES DESERVE THIS, RIGHT?

22:50.800 --> 22:53.403
SHE LIED
WHEN SHE TOOK THE PROMOTION.

22:53.403 --> 22:56.105
WHAT--WHAT IF HER DOCTOR
HAD PUT HER ON BED REST?

22:56.105 --> 22:58.107
WHAT IF--WHAT IF I NEEDED HER
TO FLY SOMEWHERE?

22:58.107 --> 23:00.580
SHE COULD'VE PUT
THE WHOLE COMPANY IN JEOPARDY.

23:00.580 --> 23:02.712
YEAH, BUT THAT NEVER HAPPENED.

23:02.712 --> 23:04.714
AND YOU SAID SHE WAS DOING
A GOOD JOB,

23:04.714 --> 23:07.457
AND NOW YOU'RE DOING
ALL THESE MEAN THINGS TO HER.

23:07.457 --> 23:09.459
ME? THIS WAS YOUR IDEA.

23:09.459 --> 23:11.891
YOU WANTED TO PUT SNAKES
IN HER OFFICE.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.162
RUBBER SNAKES.

23:13.162 --> 23:17.396
WE ARE
COMPLETELY JUSTIFIED HERE.

23:17.396 --> 23:18.898
YOU'RE RIGHT.

23:18.898 --> 23:21.400
YOU'RE RIGHT, WHICH IS WHY
WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

23:21.400 --> 23:23.873
TO DO SOMETHING
WE NEVER DO, CARLOS--

23:23.873 --> 23:25.475
FORGIVE.

23:27.607 --> 23:28.938
SERIOUSLY?

23:28.938 --> 23:31.641
TOM AND LYNETTE HAVE BEEN
OUR FRIENDS FOR 15 YEARS.

23:31.641 --> 23:33.643
THEY GAVE US
SAUSAGE-OF-THE-MONTH

23:33.643 --> 23:34.984
LAST CHRISTMAS.

23:34.984 --> 23:37.617
THOSE WERE GOOD SAUSAGES.

23:37.617 --> 23:39.889
I KNOW LYNETTE.

23:39.889 --> 23:42.191
SHE WOULD NEVER SET OUT
TO INTENTIONALLY HURT US.

23:42.191 --> 23:45.595
I GOTTA ADMIT,
I DO SORT OF MISS THOSE GUYS.

23:45.595 --> 23:48.828
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN HER
WHEN I WAS LEAVING HER OFFICE.

23:48.828 --> 23:52.462
SHE HAD THIS LOOK IN HER EYES.
SHE WAS SO DEFEATED.

23:52.462 --> 23:54.464
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN
THIS LOOK IN HER EYES.

23:54.464 --> 23:56.466
IT WAS LIKE, "SCREW YOU,
LYNETTE. I WIN!"

23:56.466 --> 23:59.469
SO THAT'S WHEN
YOU CALLED THE LAWYER?
 HELL, YES. THEY'RE NOT
GETTING AWAY WITH THIS.

23:59.469 --> 24:02.141
THEY ARE NOT GONNA HARASS ME.
I AM GONNA SUE THEIR ASS!

24:02.141 --> 24:05.475
AND CARLOS IS BEING
SERVED PAPERS TOMORROW.

24:05.475 --> 24:07.977
WOW. YOU'RE REALLY GETTIN'
WORKED UP HERE.

24:07.977 --> 24:10.480
WE ARE NOT HAVING ANGRY SEX.

24:10.480 --> 24:12.482
JUST THOUGHT I'D ASK.

24:16.125 --> 24:18.057
(sighs)

24:18.057 --> 24:21.060
WHAT DID I TELL YOU ABOUT
PUTTIN' AWAY THOSE CLOTHES?

24:23.533 --> 24:25.034
I'M SERIOUS.

24:25.034 --> 24:26.696
NAP TIME'S OVER!

24:30.670 --> 24:32.241
DANNY?

24:32.241 --> 24:34.103
DANNY? NO, NO, NO.

24:34.103 --> 24:36.105
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!
NICK!

24:44.584 --> 24:47.086
ANY WOMAN CAN BE THE VICTIM
OF A VIOLENT CRIME.

24:47.086 --> 24:50.159
THAT IS WHY IT'S NECESSARY
TO LEARN HOW TO DEFEND YOURSELF.

24:50.159 --> 24:54.163
A PARKING LOT, A PARK,
YOUR OWN DRIVEWAY.

24:54.163 --> 24:57.166
AN ATTACK CAN HAPPEN ANYWHERE.
IT ONLY TAKES A FEW SECONDS.

24:57.166 --> 25:00.169
SORRY I'M LATE.
I HAD THREE PARTIES TO PREP FOR.

25:00.169 --> 25:03.703
HOW TIRING THAT MUST BE FOR YOU,
JUGGLING ALL THOSE AFFAIRS.

25:03.703 --> 25:06.906
OKAY, EVERYONE, TEAM UP.
I WANT AN ATTACKER AND A VICTIM.

25:06.906 --> 25:09.138
HEY, GABY,
YOU WANNA ATTACK ME?

25:09.138 --> 25:11.681
OH, MRS. McCLUSKEY,
I DON'T WANNA HURT YOU.

25:11.681 --> 25:14.544
OH, PLEASE. I'VE EATEN
BURGERS BIGGER THAN YOU.

25:14.544 --> 25:18.147
ALL RIGHT, BRING IT ON.
 ALL RIGHT, GRANNY.
PREPARE TO BREAK A HIP.

25:18.147 --> 25:20.189
SO, UH...

25:20.189 --> 25:22.692
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE PARTNERS.
DO YOU WANNA ATTACK ME?

25:22.692 --> 25:25.154
I COULD BE PERSUADED.

25:25.154 --> 25:29.298
NOW, ATTACKERS, I WANT YOU
TO APPROACH YOUR VICTIM.

25:29.298 --> 25:30.700
(Gabrielle) OH!

25:30.700 --> 25:32.161
(strained voice) HEY!

25:32.161 --> 25:35.104
FREAKISHLY STRONG
OLD LADY HERE!

25:35.104 --> 25:37.907
I CREDIT THE BRAN.

25:37.907 --> 25:41.110
OH, THAT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE.
BUT THE REST OF YOU,

25:41.110 --> 25:43.112
APPROACH YOUR VICTIM
FROM BEHIND.

25:43.112 --> 25:45.975
PLACE HER IN A CHOKEHOLD.

25:45.975 --> 25:48.978
NOW, VICTIMS, YOUR IMPULSE
WILL BE TO PULL AWAY. WRONG.

25:48.978 --> 25:50.650
YOU'LL JUST CHOKE HARDER.

25:50.650 --> 25:53.783
INSTEAD, I WANT YOU TO
PUSH BACK ON YOUR ATTACKER,

25:53.783 --> 25:55.885
USING YOUR WEIGHT
TO PUSH HIM OFF BALANCE.

25:55.885 --> 25:58.888
(strained voice)
SUSAN, A LITTLE TIGHT.
 OH, I'M SORRY.

25:58.888 --> 26:00.590
(grunts) OUCH.

26:00.590 --> 26:02.592
THIS FEELS BAD, HUH?

26:02.592 --> 26:05.595
BEING BETRAYED BY SOMEONE
YOU TRUSTED NOT TO HURT YOU?

26:05.595 --> 26:08.598
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
 (whispers) I KNOW
ABOUT YOU AND KARL.

26:08.598 --> 26:09.939
(whispers) OH, NO.

26:09.939 --> 26:11.941
(normal voice)
OH, YEAH. TRAITOR!

26:11.941 --> 26:13.903
OH! STOP IT!

26:13.903 --> 26:15.244
(grunts)

26:15.244 --> 26:18.207
UH, YOU CAN'T TALK YOUR WAY
OUT OF AN ATTACK.

26:18.207 --> 26:20.309
JAB WITH YOUR ELBOWS.
 I AM TRYING TO! UHH!

26:20.309 --> 26:21.651
(grunts)
 AAH!

26:21.651 --> 26:22.982
(gasps)

26:22.982 --> 26:25.284
HOW COULD YOU?!
YOU KNOW HOW KARL TREATED ME.

26:25.284 --> 26:27.687
SUSAN, I AM SORRY.
IF YOU WILL L-LET ME EXPLAIN...

26:27.687 --> 26:30.820
OKAY, NOW,
ATTACKER AND VICTIM, SWITCH.

26:30.820 --> 26:33.823
YOU HEARD HIM! SWITCH! (grunts)
 I AM NOT LETTING YOU
GET BEHIND ME!

26:33.823 --> 26:35.825
YOU'VE ALREADY
STABBED ME IN THE BACK!
 (coughs)

26:35.825 --> 26:37.867
MRS. DELFINO,
RELEASE YOUR VICTIM.

26:37.867 --> 26:40.299
(gasps) OH!
 SHE IS NOT THE VICTIM HERE!

26:40.299 --> 26:42.031
(pants)

26:42.031 --> 26:46.135
(whispers) WHAT ABOUT ORSON?
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO HIM?!

26:46.135 --> 26:48.177
(gasps)
 YOU KNOW NOTHING
 ABOUT MY MARRIAGE TO ORSON.

26:48.177 --> 26:51.180
ORSON HAS PUT ME
THROUGH HELL THIS YEAR!
 (strained voice)
BREE, TOO TIGHT!

26:51.180 --> 26:53.012
SUSAN, I KNOW YOU'RE ANGRY...
 (gasping)

26:53.012 --> 26:54.984
BUT KARL MEANS MORE TO ME
THAN JUST A FLING,

26:54.984 --> 26:56.986
AND I AM NOT GIVING HIM UP.

26:56.986 --> 26:58.988
SO IF THAT MEANS
OUR FRIENDSHIP IS OVER,

26:58.988 --> 27:02.692
THEN THAT'S YOUR DECISION,
NOT MINE.
 UHH!

27:02.692 --> 27:05.925
YOU'RE GOING?
WE JUST, UH, GOT STARTED.

27:05.925 --> 27:07.256
I KNOW,

27:07.256 --> 27:10.629
BUT I THINK I'VE DEFENDED MYSELF
ENOUGH FOR ONE DAY.

27:13.162 --> 27:14.904
(sighs)

27:14.904 --> 27:16.265
HEY.

27:16.265 --> 27:17.236
HEY.

27:17.236 --> 27:19.769
I JUST GOT A CALL
FROM THE LAWYER.

27:19.769 --> 27:21.771
THEY'RE GONNA BE SERVING CARLOS
ANY MINUTE.

27:21.771 --> 27:23.773
WOW. YOU'RE REALLY
GOING THROUGH WITH THIS, HUH?

27:23.773 --> 27:27.116
YEAH. WE'RE NOT BAD PEOPLE,
ARE WE, TOM?

27:27.116 --> 27:29.118
LOOK, WHAT CARLOS
IS DOING TO YOU

27:29.118 --> 27:31.120
IS TOTALLY UNFAIR
AND ILLEGAL.

27:31.120 --> 27:35.324
NO, WE'RE GOOD PEOPLE.
 RIGHT, HE STARTED IT.
SCREW HIM.

27:35.324 --> 27:37.727
(Gabrielle) YOO-HOO!

27:40.029 --> 27:42.361
HEY!

27:42.361 --> 27:44.233
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

27:44.233 --> 27:46.696
UH, CANDY, FLOWERS,
BABY GIFT.

27:46.696 --> 27:48.698
SORT OF MY WAY OF SAYING,

27:48.698 --> 27:51.100
"I'M SORRY, AND HERE'S
SOME CRAP TO PROVE IT."

27:51.100 --> 27:53.272
REALLY?
 YEAH.

27:53.272 --> 27:56.275
I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT ANYMORE,
AND NEITHER DOES CARLOS.

27:56.275 --> 27:58.347
I WAS HOPING WE COULD TALK.

27:58.347 --> 28:01.350
OH, GABY! I AM SO HAPPY!

28:01.350 --> 28:03.452
AW! HERE, TAKE IT.
IT'S GETTIN' HEAVY.

28:03.452 --> 28:05.014
AW!
 (chuckles)

28:05.014 --> 28:07.016
I MISSED YOU!

28:10.089 --> 28:11.390
AW!
 UM, LYNETTE?

28:11.390 --> 28:14.393
HONEY, WE'RE HAVING A MOMENT
HERE. PLEASE DON'T SPOIL IT.

28:14.393 --> 28:19.468
(exhales deeply) I'M NOT
WHAT'S GONNA SPOIL IT.

28:19.468 --> 28:22.271
OH. COULD YOU HOLD ON
A SECOND?

28:22.271 --> 28:24.874
I'M JUST--I'M GONNA MAKE
A QUICK PHONE CALL.

28:24.874 --> 28:27.106
YOU KNOW WHAT, GUYS?
I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENS.

28:27.106 --> 28:30.379
LET'S NOT LET ANYTHING INTERFERE
WITH OUR FRIENDSHIP EVER AGAIN.

28:30.379 --> 28:32.882
REMEMBER YOU SAID THAT.

28:32.882 --> 28:35.014
(whispers) ANSWER THE PHONE.
ANSWER THE PHONE.
 (chuckles)

28:35.014 --> 28:38.087
(speaks inaudibly)

28:38.087 --> 28:39.418
WHAT?!

28:44.794 --> 28:46.996
(cell phone rings)

28:46.996 --> 28:51.030
OH! IT'S CARLOS.
I WONDER WHAT HE WANTS.

28:51.030 --> 28:54.403
GABY, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SAID
ABOUT OUR FRIENDSHIP BEFORE?

28:54.403 --> 28:57.406
(stammers) LET'S JUST
MAKE A PACT THAT WE SHOULD--

28:57.406 --> 28:59.408
HEY, BABE, WHAT'S UP?

29:04.043 --> 29:06.075
I WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU
FOR THIS.

29:06.075 --> 29:08.077
GABY, PLEASE.
WHAT ABOUT OUR PACT?

29:08.077 --> 29:11.020
WE NEVER MADE A PACT!
HERE, M.J., CATCH.

29:11.020 --> 29:14.423
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND.
I WAS JUST PROTECTING MYSELF.

29:14.423 --> 29:16.185
HELLO, LADIES. WHAT'S NEW?

29:16.185 --> 29:18.788
LYNETTE'S SUING CARLOS. HERE.

29:18.788 --> 29:21.290
ONCE YOU APOLOGIZED,
I TRIED TO CALL THE GUY OFF.

29:21.290 --> 29:23.292
LYNETTE,
YOU WANTED TO SUE US!

29:23.292 --> 29:25.995
THAT PROVES THAT
YOU ARE NOT MY FRIEND!

29:25.995 --> 29:28.437
HEY, KAREN! HERE'S SOME CANDY.
 TRYING TO CUT DOWN.

29:28.437 --> 29:30.769
REALLY?
AT YOUR AGE, WHY BOTHER?

29:30.769 --> 29:33.843
PLEASE,
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

29:33.843 --> 29:35.945
NO, YOU NEED
TO TALK TO MY LAWYER.

29:39.548 --> 29:42.311
(door opens and closes)

29:51.290 --> 29:54.423
(spritzes)

29:56.425 --> 29:58.898
HEY, LYNETTE.
GOT A PROJECT FOR YOU.

29:58.898 --> 30:01.570
OKAY. WHO'S THIS?

30:01.570 --> 30:03.432
STEVE MATTHEWS FROM LEGAL.

30:03.432 --> 30:06.435
YOU KNOW, SINCE WE ALL SEEM
TO BE LAWYERING UP AROUND HERE.

30:06.435 --> 30:09.108
LOOK, I WAS JUST TRYING
TO PROTECT MYSELF.

30:09.108 --> 30:11.110
NO, IT'S JUST BUSINESS.

30:11.110 --> 30:13.943
THIS IS THE DEPARTMENT'S
PURCHASES AND EXPENSES

30:13.943 --> 30:15.945
FROM THE LAST FISCAL YEAR.

30:15.945 --> 30:17.286
(heavy thud)

30:17.286 --> 30:19.288
I'M GONNA NEED
ALL OF THAT ITEMIZED...
 DONE.

30:19.288 --> 30:21.390
BY TOMORROW MORNING,
9:00 A.M.

30:21.390 --> 30:25.254
(laughs)

30:25.254 --> 30:27.556
I... HATE IT WHEN
I'M THE ONLY ONE LAUGHING.

30:27.556 --> 30:31.260
THIS, UH, THIS IS AT LEAST
TWO DAYS' WORK.

30:31.260 --> 30:34.233
NOT IF YOU WORK TONIGHT.

30:34.233 --> 30:36.365
(scoffs) PENNY'S
CHRISTMAS PAGEANT IS TONIGHT.

30:36.365 --> 30:38.908
YOU KNOW THAT.
YOU GO EVERY YEAR.

30:38.908 --> 30:42.271
LYNETTE, ARE YOU TELLING ME
THAT YOU'RE UNABLE TO...

30:42.271 --> 30:45.274
WHAT WAS IT AGAIN?
 UNABLE TO PERFORM
THE ASSIGNED TASK

30:45.274 --> 30:48.077
IN A TIMELY MANNER.
 YEAH, THAT'S IT.

30:48.077 --> 30:49.248
NO.

30:49.248 --> 30:51.250
TELL YOUR UNDERTAKER FRIEND

30:51.250 --> 30:53.252
THAT I WILL
GET THE ASSIGNMENT DONE...

30:53.252 --> 30:54.924
IN A TIMELY MANNER.

30:54.924 --> 30:57.326
GREAT.
AND WILL YOU TELL PENNY

30:57.326 --> 31:01.460
GABY AND I ARE GONNA HAVE
TO MISS HER PAGEANT THIS YEAR?

31:01.460 --> 31:03.292
AND WE ARE SO SORRY.

31:09.368 --> 31:12.401
THANK YOU BOTH FOR COMING.

31:12.401 --> 31:15.374
BEFORE WE GET STARTED,
CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING?

31:15.374 --> 31:17.346
GIVEN WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT
TO DO TO US,

31:17.346 --> 31:20.409
I'LL TAKE A CIGARETTE
AND A BLINDFOLD.
 NO, NO. NO, NO.

31:20.409 --> 31:24.453
I HAVE DECIDED TO PUT ASIDE
MY RAGE AND SENSE OF BETRAYAL.

31:24.453 --> 31:26.455
I'M HERE TO HELP YOU.

31:26.455 --> 31:28.918
REALLY?
 NOT YOU.

31:31.290 --> 31:34.463
IF YOU ARE
ACTUALLY CONSIDERING

31:34.463 --> 31:36.465
HAVING A SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP
WITH THIS MAN,

31:36.465 --> 31:39.398
THEN I WANNA MAKE SURE
THAT YOU HAVE ALL THE FACTS.

31:39.398 --> 31:41.370
WHAT KIND OF FACTS?

31:41.370 --> 31:43.472
KARL FACTS.

31:43.472 --> 31:48.477
KARL, TELL BREE WHAT YOU GOT ME
FOR MY 30th BIRTHDAY.

31:48.477 --> 31:50.479
WHO CAN REMEMBER?
IT WAS SO LONG AGO.

31:50.479 --> 31:54.443
NOTHING! HE GOT ME NOTHING
BECAUSE HE FORGOT MY BIRTHDAY.

31:54.443 --> 31:57.916
AND IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO.
 I DON'T SEE THE POINT OF--

31:57.916 --> 32:00.950
NOW TELL HER WHERE YOU SPENT
OUR TENTH ANNIVERSARY.

32:00.950 --> 32:04.093
(mutters)

32:04.093 --> 32:06.525
I'M SORRY. WHAT WAS THAT?
 A STRIP CLUB.

32:06.525 --> 32:08.427
OH, KARL!

32:08.427 --> 32:10.129
THAT'S NOTHING.

32:10.129 --> 32:13.602
NOW TELL HER WHAT YOU WANTED
FOR YOUR 35th BIRTHDAY.

32:13.602 --> 32:16.035
AW, COME ON.

32:16.035 --> 32:20.009
HE WANTED ME TO ASK A FRIEND
TO JOIN US IN THE BEDROOM.

32:21.440 --> 32:24.413
YOU KEPT SAYING
I WAS HARD TO SHOP FOR.

32:24.413 --> 32:27.146
THERE HE IS, BREE.

32:27.146 --> 32:30.149
THAT IS THE MAN
YOU SAY YOU WANNA BE WITH.

32:30.149 --> 32:34.023
SUSAN, I WENT INTO THIS
WITH MY EYES WIDE OPEN.

32:34.023 --> 32:37.156
I KNOW WHO KARL WAS
AND WHO HE SOMETIMES STILL IS.

32:37.156 --> 32:40.159
BUT I BELIEVE HIM WHEN
HE SAYS HE WANTS TO CHANGE.

32:40.159 --> 32:42.331
AND ISN'T THAT
WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO

32:42.331 --> 32:44.333
WHEN YOU LOVE SOMEONE?

32:46.365 --> 32:49.498
DID YOU SAY... "LOVE"?

32:54.543 --> 32:56.405
I THINK I DID.

32:56.405 --> 32:59.608
BREE, I HAVE TO ASK YOU
ONE QUESTION.

32:59.608 --> 33:01.350
ARE YOU DRINKING AGAIN?

33:01.350 --> 33:02.611
NO!

33:02.611 --> 33:06.015
OKAY, OKAY,
I WAS JUST CHECKING.

33:06.015 --> 33:08.157
WELL...

33:08.157 --> 33:11.090
IF THAT'S REALLY
THE WAY YOU FEEL,

33:11.090 --> 33:13.322
THEN YOU SHOULD BE
WITH HIM.

33:13.322 --> 33:17.396
AND YOU HAVE...
MY BLESSING.

33:17.396 --> 33:20.399
REALLY? YOU CAN FORGIVE ME
JUST LIKE THAT?

33:20.399 --> 33:22.701
YOU KNOW, I WAS DOING
A LOT OF THINKING

33:22.701 --> 33:24.703
SINCE, YOU KNOW, YESTERDAY,

33:24.703 --> 33:28.137
AND I REALIZED THAT, UH...

33:28.137 --> 33:31.410
IT'S HARD TO FIND... LOVE.

33:31.410 --> 33:33.712
AND WHEN YOU DO,
YOU SHOULD GRAB IT.

33:33.712 --> 33:36.014
AND WHO CARES
WHAT ANYBODY THINKS?

33:38.117 --> 33:41.390
AND I REALLY DO WANT YOU TO BE
AS HAPPY AS I AM WITH MIKE.

33:41.390 --> 33:43.492
OH.

33:43.492 --> 33:45.154
THANK YOU, SUSAN.

33:45.154 --> 33:48.026
(chuckles)

33:48.026 --> 33:50.028
DON'T WORRY, SUSIE Q.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.501
I'M GOING TO DO RIGHT
BY HER.

33:52.501 --> 33:56.405
YOU REALLY THINK
YOU CAN CHANGE?

33:56.405 --> 33:57.706
WELL, IT'S EASY

33:57.706 --> 34:00.409
WHEN YOU'VE FOUND A WOMAN
WORTH CHANGING FOR.

34:00.409 --> 34:01.770
OH, I-I-I DIDN'T MEAN...

34:01.770 --> 34:04.443
OH! AH! OW! OW!
OW! OW! OW! OW!

34:04.443 --> 34:08.177
LEARNED THAT
IN SELF-DEFENSE CLASS.

34:11.080 --> 34:12.551
BYE, MOM.
 BYE, MOM.

34:12.551 --> 34:14.553
BYE-BYE!
 HEY, WE'RE TAKING OFF.

34:14.553 --> 34:16.554
OKAY.
 WISH YOUR LITTLE ANGEL LUCK.

34:16.554 --> 34:18.427
OH, GOOD LUCK, SWEETIE.

34:18.427 --> 34:20.629
NOW REMEMBER, YOUR DAD'S GONNA
VIDEOTAPE YOUR PAGEANT,

34:20.629 --> 34:22.291
AND WE'RE ALL GONNA
WATCH IT TOMORROW.

34:22.291 --> 34:25.364
SWEETIE, I'M SORRY.
YOU KNOW I'D BE THERE, BUT--

34:25.364 --> 34:28.237
YOU HAVE TO WORK.
IT'S OKAY.

34:38.377 --> 34:40.409
HEY, GUYS! WAIT UP!

34:43.482 --> 34:47.286
THE DOCTOR'S PUTTING HIM
UNDER OBSERVATION FOR 72 HOURS.

34:47.286 --> 34:50.518
IT'S STANDARD PROCEDURE FOR...

34:50.518 --> 34:53.322
A SUICIDE ATTEMPT.

34:53.322 --> 34:55.164
IT'S OKAY, MONA.

34:55.164 --> 34:58.467
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.

34:58.467 --> 35:00.469
(exhales deeply)

35:01.870 --> 35:04.433
MY BABY...

35:04.433 --> 35:06.635
WHAT WERE YOU THINKIN', HUH?

35:17.686 --> 35:19.848
I'M SORRY I CALLED THE FEDS.

35:22.591 --> 35:25.294
I WAS TRYING TO
MAKE YOUR LIFE EASIER

35:25.294 --> 35:29.458
AFTER ALL THE THINGS I'D DONE
TO MAKE IT HARDER.

35:29.458 --> 35:31.760
OH, LOOK WHAT I'VE DONE
TO THIS KID.

35:34.403 --> 35:36.565
(scoffs)

35:36.565 --> 35:40.409
NOVEMBER 10th, 1991.

35:40.409 --> 35:42.371
IT RAINED ALL DAY. REMEMBER?

35:42.371 --> 35:43.712
MM-HMM.

35:43.712 --> 35:45.714
YOU WENT TO THE DINER

35:45.714 --> 35:48.647
BEFORE WE WENT
TO MEET UP WITH THE OTHERS.

35:48.647 --> 35:51.420
I HAD PUMPKIN PANCAKES.

35:51.420 --> 35:52.881
YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING.

35:52.881 --> 35:55.524
I HAD COFFEE.
 HMM.

35:55.524 --> 35:59.488
I FORGET MY UMBRELLA
IN THE BOOTH.

35:59.488 --> 36:02.891
AND THEN EIGHT HOURS LATER,
NEITHER OF US EXISTED ANYMORE.

36:09.538 --> 36:12.741
I HAD TO RUN,
BUT YOU DIDN'T.

36:12.741 --> 36:16.905
YOU GAVE UP A HELL OF A LOT
JUST SO I WOULDN'T BE ALONE.

36:16.905 --> 36:18.877
I'D DO IT AGAIN.

36:18.877 --> 36:22.581
I'D DO ANYTHING
FOR YOU GUYS.

36:22.581 --> 36:24.583
I HOPE YOU KNOW THAT.

36:24.583 --> 36:27.586
I DO.

36:49.538 --> 36:50.979
(knock on door)

36:50.979 --> 36:53.582
GOOD MORNING, LYNETTE.
IT'S 9:00.

36:53.582 --> 36:55.444
GOT MY REPORTS?

36:55.444 --> 36:57.346
ALMOST.

36:57.346 --> 36:59.418
SO ARE YOU TELLING ME
YOU'RE NOT DONE?

36:59.418 --> 37:02.291
I JUST NEED ONE MORE HOUR.

37:02.291 --> 37:06.255
OH, LYNETTE. (sighs)
IF ONLY I NEEDED THEM BY 10:00.

37:06.255 --> 37:10.299
UNFORTUNATELY, I TOLD YOU
THAT I NEEDED THEM BY 9:00.

37:10.299 --> 37:12.661
WAS I NOT CLEAR?
 YOU WERE CRYSTAL CLEAR.

37:12.661 --> 37:14.663
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE

37:14.663 --> 37:16.905
TO GET ALL THIS WORK DONE
IN A NIGHT, CARLOS.

37:16.905 --> 37:18.907
YOU KNEW THAT
WHEN YOU GAVE IT TO ME.

37:18.907 --> 37:20.909
WELL, IT WOULDN'T HAVE
BEEN IMPOSSIBLE

37:20.909 --> 37:23.812
IF YOU'D SKIPPED
YOUR DAUGHTER'S PAGEANT.

37:23.812 --> 37:25.874
I KNOW YOU WENT.

37:25.874 --> 37:28.847
ANYWAY, THIS IS
VERY PAINFUL FOR ME,

37:28.847 --> 37:30.849
BUT I HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE

37:30.849 --> 37:32.981
BUT TO TERMINATE
YOUR EMPLOYMENT.

37:32.981 --> 37:35.484
YOU'RE REALLY
GOING TO DO THIS?

37:35.484 --> 37:38.587
I BELIEVE I'M WITHIN
MY LEGAL RIGHTS.

37:38.587 --> 37:40.889
YOU NEED TO CLEAR OUT
YOUR PERSONAL BELONGINGS

37:40.889 --> 37:43.261
WITHIN THE HOUR, MRS. SCAVO.

37:43.261 --> 37:45.594
(exhales deeply)

37:45.594 --> 37:47.696
(pen clatters)

37:47.696 --> 37:50.869
(voice breaks)
I WAS UP ALL NIGHT ON THIS.

37:50.869 --> 37:53.001
THAT'S A SHAME.

37:53.001 --> 37:56.004
SO MR. MATTHEWS HAS
SOME PAPERWORK FOR YOU TO SIGN.

37:56.004 --> 37:59.508
YOU'RE GONNA REGRET THIS.
I'M NOT GONNA GO QUIETLY.

38:04.483 --> 38:07.516
I DON'T CARE HOW YOU GO.

38:07.516 --> 38:09.688
I JUST WANT YOU GONE.

38:21.069 --> 38:23.732
OH, GOOD. YOU'RE UP.
I'M MONA CLARKE.

38:23.732 --> 38:26.705
I LIVE DOWN THE STREET
FROM YOU AND YOUR FOLKS.

38:26.705 --> 38:29.738
I TOLD THEM I WOULD
TAKE REAL GOOD CARE OF YOU.

38:29.738 --> 38:32.581
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME JUICE, DANNY?
 TYLER.

38:32.581 --> 38:34.343
WHAT?

38:34.343 --> 38:37.486
(exhales deeply)
IT'S NOT DANNY.

38:39.518 --> 38:41.990
MY NAME'S TYLER.

38:47.456 --> 38:48.957
BYE, GIRLS.
THANKS FOR COMING.

38:48.957 --> 38:50.629
(children shouting in distance)

38:50.629 --> 38:52.501
MIKE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

38:52.501 --> 38:55.764
I'M HERE TO PICK UP M.J.
 BUT SHE SAID
YOU COULDN'T MAKE IT.

38:55.764 --> 38:58.437
SHE WAS
PICKING HIM UP FOR YOU.
 WHO? SUSAN?

38:58.437 --> 39:00.369
NO, YOUR NEIGHBOR KATHERINE.

39:00.369 --> 39:03.572
WHAT?!

39:03.572 --> 39:06.344
DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG?
 (car door closes,
engine starts)

39:20.529 --> 39:22.561
M.J.!

39:22.561 --> 39:24.533
HI, DADDY.

39:24.533 --> 39:25.994
I DROVE BY EILEEN'S,

39:25.994 --> 39:28.397
AND I-I SAW MY LITTLE BUDDY
STANDING OUT THERE.

39:28.397 --> 39:30.399
HE LOOKED SO FORLORN.

39:33.802 --> 39:35.844
M.J., GO HOME.

39:35.844 --> 39:37.846
I FIGURED YOU WERE
LATE AT SOME JOB,

39:37.846 --> 39:40.649
SO I THOUGHT
I'D DO YOU A FAVOR.
 NOW.

39:49.157 --> 39:50.519
(door opens and closes)

39:52.661 --> 39:55.594
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

39:55.594 --> 39:57.896
I NEEDED
TO TALK TO HIM, MIKE.

39:57.896 --> 40:00.499
HE DESERVES
TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

40:00.499 --> 40:02.501
(voice breaks)
HIS MOTHER LIES TO HIM.

40:02.501 --> 40:06.034
HE NEEDS TO KNOW THAT
WHAT YOU AND I HAD WAS REAL.

40:06.034 --> 40:09.738
YOU AND I HAD NOTHING.

40:09.738 --> 40:12.581
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

40:12.581 --> 40:14.843
IT'S TRUE.

40:14.843 --> 40:17.646
THE WHOLE TIME
I WAS WITH YOU,

40:17.646 --> 40:19.648
ALL I THOUGHT ABOUT
WAS SUSAN.

40:19.648 --> 40:21.920
EVERY TIME I HELD YOU,

40:21.920 --> 40:24.523
EVERY TIME I KISSED YOU,

40:24.523 --> 40:27.826
ALL I WAS THINKING WAS,

40:27.826 --> 40:31.159
GOD, I WISH YOU WERE SUSAN.

40:38.507 --> 40:40.008
(knife clatters)

40:44.543 --> 40:46.515
IF YOU MEAN IT,

40:46.515 --> 40:49.518
THEN PLEASE KILL ME.

40:49.518 --> 40:52.551
(whispers)
IT WOULD BE LESS PAINFUL.

40:58.557 --> 41:01.159
I DON'T CARE ENOUGH ABOUT YOU
TO KILL YOU.

41:01.159 --> 41:02.931
(knife clatters)

41:08.637 --> 41:10.939
(door opens and closes)

41:10.939 --> 41:16.575
THE WORLD IS A DANGEROUS PLACE,

41:16.575 --> 41:18.547
AND WE MUST LEARN
TO DEFEND OURSELVES

41:18.547 --> 41:21.580
FROM THOSE
WHO WANT TO HURT US...

41:25.684 --> 41:29.918
THAT STRANGER WITHOUT A NAME...

41:32.961 --> 41:36.925
AN EMPLOYER WHO HOLDS
A GRUDGE...

41:39.698 --> 41:43.702
THE HUSBAND WHO WON'T LET GO.

41:43.702 --> 41:47.175
YES, WE ALL TRY
TO DEFEND OURSELVES

41:47.175 --> 41:49.708
SO WE WON'T GET HURT.

41:49.708 --> 41:51.179
(gasping)

41:51.179 --> 41:54.713
(shaky voice) YES, I NEED
AN AMBULANCE RIGHT AWAY.

41:54.713 --> 41:56.585
4356 WISTERIA LANE.

41:56.585 --> 41:59.548
PLEASE HURRY.
I'M LOSING A LOT OF BLOOD.

41:59.548 --> 42:01.920
(telephone clatters)

42:03.952 --> 42:08.697
UNTIL THE MOMENT WE REALIZE
 OUR PAIN...

42:08.697 --> 42:10.028
(stabbing sound)
 (gasps)

42:10.028 --> 42:13.862
CAN HURT SOMEONE ELSE.

42:16.635 --> 42:17.966
(thud)
