WEBVTT

00:01.134 --> 00:02.601
We've all known what it's like

00:02.603 --> 00:04.336
When it seems
that our only light

00:04.338 --> 00:07.239
Is the flicker of a candle
in the heart of a shaft,

00:07.241 --> 00:09.641
But I believe that
that candle is providence,

00:09.643 --> 00:12.211
Guiding us through
our own darkness

00:12.213 --> 00:14.246
These past few months...

00:14.248 --> 00:16.348
Heathen. What?

00:17.250 --> 00:18.617
You're late.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.219
Only heathens arrive late
to a church service.

00:20.221 --> 00:22.087
Uncouth.

00:22.089 --> 00:24.223
Me? Uncouth?

00:24.225 --> 00:26.358
Only the uncouth
whisper during a sermon.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.626
Shh!

00:27.628 --> 00:29.228
...Because together,

00:29.230 --> 00:32.331
We can see a way
out of the darkness.

00:39.239 --> 00:41.106
Nice sermon.

00:41.108 --> 00:44.109
Well, I'm glad you enjoyed
the sentiment.

00:44.111 --> 00:46.378
I'm very sentimental.

00:46.380 --> 00:49.181
I thought you knew.

00:49.183 --> 00:52.051
Good day, mrs. Montgomery.

00:54.521 --> 00:56.688
[elizabeth, quietly]:
Why does the company

00:56.690 --> 00:58.190
Feel the need
to send its spies

00:58.192 --> 00:59.391
Even to a Sunday school?

00:59.393 --> 01:02.061
Because, clearly,
some people in this town

01:02.063 --> 01:04.196
Don't trust each other.

01:10.136 --> 01:12.071
It's my job to find out why.

01:16.443 --> 01:21.180
I'm trying to puzzle
something out, reverend.

01:21.182 --> 01:23.082
Now, I'm paying you

01:23.084 --> 01:24.416
To offer wisdom

01:24.418 --> 01:26.552
And spiritual inspiration
from the good book

01:26.554 --> 01:28.187
To the people
of this community.

01:28.189 --> 01:30.155
That's correct,
is it not?

01:30.157 --> 01:32.091
That's what
I'm doing, mr. Gowen.

01:34.294 --> 01:38.430
Though I notice
that your head-count

01:38.432 --> 01:40.299
Is practically nil.

01:41.501 --> 01:45.304
Now, why am I
paying for the cow

01:45.306 --> 01:47.339
When no one's drinking the milk?

01:47.341 --> 01:51.376
With a new church building,
I am certain they will return.

01:51.378 --> 01:53.378
As you might imagine,

01:53.380 --> 01:56.181
Not many people want to worship
in a saloon.

01:56.183 --> 01:57.449
Well, I can appreciate that,

01:57.451 --> 01:59.451
Except that cat montgomery
is drawing a crowd

01:59.453 --> 02:01.420
In a grove of trees.

02:03.323 --> 02:06.125
Perhaps I should put her
on the payroll.

02:07.393 --> 02:11.530
[â™ª]

02:30.250 --> 02:32.551
You're gonna get trampled.

02:32.553 --> 02:34.319
Come on up here.

02:42.529 --> 02:44.229
Good dog.

02:44.231 --> 02:46.231
[elizabeth]:
Imagine it's 2,000 years ago.

02:46.233 --> 02:49.701
We're living in ancient rome.

02:49.703 --> 02:52.504
How did we know
when the work day had ended?

02:52.506 --> 02:53.705
Rosaleen, do you know?

02:56.643 --> 02:58.377
The steam whistle blows?

02:58.379 --> 03:00.779
Good try, but it hasn't
been invented yet.

03:00.781 --> 03:03.382
Before machines,

03:03.384 --> 03:06.385
How did people tell time?

03:06.387 --> 03:07.519
The sun?

03:07.521 --> 03:08.654
Yes!

03:08.656 --> 03:09.922
They used sundials.

03:09.924 --> 03:12.791
Here's a picture
of a roman sundial.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.526
And this is
a latin phrase,

03:14.528 --> 03:17.462
"ut hora fugit vita."

03:17.464 --> 03:18.664
"hora."

03:18.666 --> 03:20.732
Does that sound like
an english word?

03:22.602 --> 03:24.836
It means "hour."

03:24.838 --> 03:27.706
"ut hora fugit vita."

03:27.708 --> 03:28.807
"as an hour,

03:28.809 --> 03:31.410
Life flies."

03:31.412 --> 03:34.279
Our lives are made up of hours.

03:34.281 --> 03:35.614
I want all of you to think of

03:35.616 --> 03:37.416
Your most important hour
of the day,

03:37.418 --> 03:39.484
And write a paragraph
describing it.

03:41.421 --> 03:42.721
If you aren't writing

03:42.723 --> 03:45.290
All of your letters
and words yet,

03:45.292 --> 03:46.692
Draw a picture instead.

03:46.694 --> 03:47.759
Okay, rosaleen?

03:52.832 --> 03:56.235
[knock on door]

04:01.841 --> 04:03.508
Good afternoon,

04:03.510 --> 04:04.710
Mrs. Montgomery.

04:04.712 --> 04:06.445
Reverend.

04:06.447 --> 04:07.713
Please, come in.

04:07.715 --> 04:09.748
I hope you like
poppyseed cake.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.316
Well, it's
gabe's favorite,

04:11.318 --> 04:14.419
And I've been known
to take a bite.

04:15.855 --> 04:17.589
You don't see many
of these in coal valley.

04:17.591 --> 04:18.523
I brought it with me.

04:20.460 --> 04:23.595
My husband loved hearing me
play the old songs.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.330
Took his mind
off of work.

04:25.332 --> 04:26.665
I'd enjoy hearing you play.

04:26.667 --> 04:29.468
Oh, they're just...
Sweet, little songs.

04:29.470 --> 04:32.271
Sweet, old songs
are the best.

04:46.786 --> 04:49.554
[plays piano]

04:58.765 --> 05:00.565
[finishes song]

05:02.669 --> 05:04.670
You have a soothing touch.

05:04.672 --> 05:07.439
I envy you.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.641
I am...
Not that way.

05:09.643 --> 05:10.909
Ever since the disaster,

05:10.911 --> 05:13.645
I've felt the miners
draw away from me.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.447
Reverend,

05:15.449 --> 05:16.848
The families needed
someone who could comfort them.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.817
Someone
who understood.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.519
That's the appeal
of your preaching.

05:20.521 --> 05:22.387
I don't preach.

05:22.389 --> 05:23.922
You speak to
a congregation of people

05:23.924 --> 05:25.390
Each Sunday morning.

05:25.392 --> 05:27.592
That seems like preaching to me.

05:27.594 --> 05:29.661
I teach Sunday school,
that is all.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.430
I appreciate

05:31.432 --> 05:33.565
That you preach
the word of the lord,

05:33.567 --> 05:37.669
But, mrs. Montgomery,
those are my congregants.

05:37.671 --> 05:41.573
After they explosion, I...

05:41.575 --> 05:45.711
I told the children of this town
some stories

05:45.713 --> 05:50.682
To lift their hearts.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.551
Then their parents
started to come, too.

05:52.553 --> 05:54.986
Maybe they just liked
the fresh air,

05:54.988 --> 05:57.889
Or maybe they like
what I have to say,

05:57.891 --> 05:59.424
But if you won't

05:59.426 --> 06:01.026
Meet their needs,

06:01.028 --> 06:03.095
They will flock
to someone who will.

06:03.097 --> 06:06.698
And if they are getting
any comfort from me,

06:06.700 --> 06:09.568
Then I will not stop.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.636
I see.

06:16.442 --> 06:19.411
Thank you for the music.

06:28.521 --> 06:29.955
Rosaleen, wanna play?

06:31.858 --> 06:33.725
With mrs. Stanton
out of town

06:33.727 --> 06:34.993
Tending to her cousin,

06:34.995 --> 06:36.628
Rosaleen's mother
invited me for dinner,

06:36.630 --> 06:37.996
But I'm sure rosaleen

06:37.998 --> 06:39.998
Would love to play
with you another day.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.400
Bye.

06:41.402 --> 06:42.534
Bye!

06:43.736 --> 06:44.736
Anna's nice,

06:44.738 --> 06:46.772
Don't you think?

06:46.774 --> 06:48.740
I'm looking forward to dinner.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.909
Do you know
what we're having?

06:50.911 --> 06:52.477
Oh.

06:52.479 --> 06:54.780
Then it'll be a surprise.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.715
Surprises are fun.

07:18.838 --> 07:21.072
I'm hungry, aren't you?

07:21.074 --> 07:22.707
Let's hurry.

07:30.783 --> 07:32.884
Rosaleen was named after
her grandmother.

07:34.587 --> 07:35.787
Isn't that right?

07:35.789 --> 07:37.456
Dear?

07:38.558 --> 07:39.925
And her grandfather
worked in the mines

07:39.927 --> 07:40.992
Across the water,

07:40.994 --> 07:44.563
So we have coal dust
in our blood.

07:44.565 --> 07:46.064
There's no more,

07:46.066 --> 07:47.933
I'm sorry to say.

07:47.935 --> 07:49.134
It was delicious,

07:49.136 --> 07:50.735
And certainly
all I could ask for.

07:50.737 --> 07:53.939
Ah, well, we did our best,
the dear knows.

07:55.074 --> 07:56.608
Rosaleen,
isn't that the truth?

07:58.945 --> 08:01.680
You may be excused
if you wish.

08:16.162 --> 08:17.562
She was such
a happy child

08:17.564 --> 08:19.030
Before that day,

08:19.032 --> 08:20.832
The day
of the disaster.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.835
You wouldn't know it now,
but she had a joy about her,

08:23.837 --> 08:25.036
There was a joy and a lightness,
I tell you.

08:25.038 --> 08:27.706
I know there was.

08:27.708 --> 08:28.907
It's still there, I'm sure.

08:30.743 --> 08:33.578
She so loved her father.

08:33.580 --> 08:34.646
Patrick.

08:35.982 --> 08:38.783
Every day, she'd take
his lunch pail to him,

08:38.785 --> 08:40.719
And the two of them...

08:40.721 --> 08:42.654
Aw, the two of them,

08:42.656 --> 08:45.991
Patrick so big
and little rosaleen...

08:45.993 --> 08:47.893
They'd sit at the entrance
of the mine,

08:47.895 --> 08:48.960
And she'd laugh with him.

08:53.165 --> 08:56.535
She hasn't spoken
since that day.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.538
You're a teacher.

08:59.540 --> 09:00.906
You can help her.

09:00.908 --> 09:04.142
Can't you?

09:04.144 --> 09:06.077
You must know some way
we can reach her.

09:07.146 --> 09:08.213
What should I do?

09:11.083 --> 09:12.717
We'll find a way.

09:16.622 --> 09:18.123
Molly...

09:19.892 --> 09:22.928
We saw a man
on they way here.

09:22.930 --> 09:25.163
He had a black wagon.

09:25.165 --> 09:30.101
A broken-down wagon,
a broken down man...

09:30.103 --> 09:33.705
He looked at rosaleen
and he seemed to upset her.

09:34.707 --> 09:36.207
That would be wendell backus.

09:36.209 --> 09:39.177
He upsets everyone.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.980
Some of the miners find
they need drink,

09:41.982 --> 09:44.849
But wendell has always
been known to haunt the saloon.

09:46.786 --> 09:49.654
Since the disaster,
it's gotten worse.

09:53.225 --> 09:55.126
Can you say good night
to miss thatcher?

09:59.799 --> 10:01.066
Then a hug will have to do.

10:07.073 --> 10:08.773
Off we go to bed, now.

10:14.680 --> 10:16.881
Please help my little girl.

10:28.694 --> 10:30.895
Well, look who's here.

10:56.255 --> 10:58.823
If you're movin' in,
you're gonna need a name.

11:00.993 --> 11:03.194
I'm calling you "rip,"
as in "rip van winkle."

11:06.265 --> 11:07.265
[door opens and closes]

11:07.267 --> 11:08.933
Excuse me...

11:10.269 --> 11:12.671
Might I have
a moment of your time?

11:12.673 --> 11:15.006
Of course.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.175
I was happy to see this hat
ride into town.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.910
Hope you haven't
been too disappointed

11:18.912 --> 11:20.278
In the head under it.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.781
Please.

11:22.783 --> 11:23.948
I trust I won't be.

11:27.887 --> 11:29.888
As the official lawman
in town,

11:29.890 --> 11:33.758
There is an unresolved case
that requires your attention.

11:36.295 --> 11:38.897
Someone burned down my church
six weeks ago.

11:38.899 --> 11:41.166
That's a pretty
serious charge.

11:41.168 --> 11:42.834
And what makes you
think it was arson,

11:42.836 --> 11:44.035
Not just an accident?

11:44.037 --> 11:45.303
It was too coincidental.

11:45.305 --> 11:48.039
On the same night
as we held a vigil

11:48.041 --> 11:50.175
For 43 deceased miners,

11:50.177 --> 11:51.843
My church burns.

11:51.845 --> 11:54.312
Well, I understand you
questioning coincidence,

11:54.314 --> 11:56.915
But I don't understand
the motive.

11:56.917 --> 11:59.084
My position here
at coal valley

11:59.086 --> 12:01.119
Has always been delicate.

12:01.121 --> 12:02.821
I have always tended

12:02.823 --> 12:04.055
To the spiritual needs
of the people, but..

12:04.057 --> 12:07.225
Something changed.

12:07.227 --> 12:10.128
After the mine explosion.

12:10.130 --> 12:12.197
People stopped
seeing me as a man of god

12:12.199 --> 12:14.999
And started only seeing me
as a company man.

12:16.068 --> 12:17.068
Pacific northwest mining

12:17.070 --> 12:18.970
Funds my salary.

12:18.972 --> 12:21.072
Maybe they don't like
praying at an altar

12:21.074 --> 12:22.841
Paid for by the coal company.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.075
But why burn down the church?

12:24.077 --> 12:27.345
People were sad and angry.

12:27.347 --> 12:29.214
They lashed out at the company,

12:29.216 --> 12:31.216
At god.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.217
In both cases,

12:32.219 --> 12:33.952
Their anger
was misplaced

12:33.954 --> 12:36.054
And fueled by cat montgomery
and her preaching.

12:37.356 --> 12:40.258
You think cat montgomery
somehow burned down the church?

12:40.260 --> 12:43.128
Oh, I am not making
any accusations,

12:43.130 --> 12:45.029
But I do know my church burned.

12:45.031 --> 12:47.232
The pinkerton men
were unable to find out

12:47.234 --> 12:48.233
How the fire started,

12:48.235 --> 12:50.101
And ever since then,

12:50.103 --> 12:54.105
Mrs. Montgomery has enjoyed,
shall we say, a larger audience.

12:54.107 --> 12:57.008
I am asking you to investigate.

12:57.010 --> 13:00.044
That is the duty
your uniform represents.

13:02.982 --> 13:04.916
I'll have a look around
the burn site.

13:05.885 --> 13:06.885
Thank you.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.253
I would appreciate

13:08.255 --> 13:10.321
At least finding out
what mrs. Montgomery knows.

13:11.390 --> 13:12.991
I am not
a vindictive man,

13:12.993 --> 13:15.860
But everyone deserves justice,

13:15.862 --> 13:17.862
Even a preacher.

14:42.948 --> 14:44.415
[shop bell jingles]

14:44.417 --> 14:47.952
Morning.

14:47.954 --> 14:52.290
I wonder if you happen to know
what this can is.

14:53.292 --> 14:54.292
Maybe. Not sure.

14:56.028 --> 14:57.028
I'll take your best guess.

15:06.238 --> 15:07.972
That's whale oil.

15:07.974 --> 15:09.540
Really?

15:09.542 --> 15:10.508
That's my best guess.

15:12.311 --> 15:14.979
Do you sell it here?

15:17.049 --> 15:18.516
I don't know if you are aware,

15:18.518 --> 15:20.451
But the world
hasn't used whale oil

15:20.453 --> 15:22.053
For a couple of decades.

15:23.255 --> 15:26.925
Well, any idea
who might need to use it today?

15:28.260 --> 15:31.129
Maybe someone making
foul-smelling soap,

15:31.131 --> 15:33.331
Or, uh... An eskimo.

15:35.034 --> 15:37.135
Don't see many of them
around here, though.

15:37.137 --> 15:39.537
Can't say I have either.

15:39.539 --> 15:41.039
Thank you, ned.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.540
You've been... Helpful.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.075
Mm-hmm.

15:46.211 --> 15:50.181
Do you like red?

15:50.183 --> 15:51.349
Can you draw a picture

15:51.351 --> 15:52.216
Of your most important
hour of the day?

15:54.420 --> 15:57.422
I can help if you like.

16:04.596 --> 16:06.164
You seem tired.

16:06.166 --> 16:07.165
Did you have your lunch today?

16:09.435 --> 16:11.436
Lunch is
very important.

16:11.438 --> 16:13.371
It gives you energy
for your school work.

16:13.373 --> 16:15.340
You should never skip lunch.

16:15.342 --> 16:17.508
It helps
keep you strong.

16:20.479 --> 16:22.313
What's wrong?

16:22.315 --> 16:24.582
If you can't find
the out-loud words,

16:24.584 --> 16:26.584
That's all right.

16:26.586 --> 16:29.520
Maybe you can draw a picture
of how you're feeling.

16:55.381 --> 16:56.447
Rosaleen?

16:59.118 --> 17:00.284
Rosaleen, it's time
to walk home now.

17:02.221 --> 17:04.355
I'll come with you.

17:13.766 --> 17:18.202
[someone
practices piano inside]

17:23.509 --> 17:24.575
Oh!

17:24.577 --> 17:25.643
Good afternoon, constable.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.245
Afternoon, ma'am.

17:27.247 --> 17:28.513
What can I do for you?
[kids squabbling]

17:28.515 --> 17:30.681
I had a question...

17:30.683 --> 17:34.152
But I can come back
at a more convenient time.

17:34.154 --> 17:35.253
Nonsense, with
three children,

17:35.255 --> 17:37.255
Trust me, no time is convenient.

17:37.257 --> 17:38.523
Please, come in,

17:38.525 --> 17:40.258
So long as
you don't mind talking

17:40.260 --> 17:41.159
While I'm
preparing dinner--

17:41.161 --> 17:42.393
[children arguing]

17:42.395 --> 17:44.395
Gabe, give it back
to your brother.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.130
[piano practice resumes]

17:46.132 --> 17:48.066
Can you clean up
the table for me, miles?

17:53.539 --> 17:55.239
Please hello
to the constable.

17:57.142 --> 17:58.342
Gabe.

18:04.683 --> 18:06.084
Keep that thumb
in line.

18:07.152 --> 18:08.352
There you go.

18:08.354 --> 18:10.455
Really? You didn't
put my stuff away?

18:10.457 --> 18:11.556
Put the books
away, miles.

18:11.558 --> 18:13.224
[miles]:
Well, it's yours.

18:16.628 --> 18:18.429
So, knives?

18:18.431 --> 18:19.497
What was the question
you wanted to ask?

18:19.499 --> 18:21.566
Oh, um,

18:21.568 --> 18:23.701
I, uh...

18:23.703 --> 18:27.338
I was just wondering
if you had a spare coal caddy?

18:27.340 --> 18:29.574
When I took over the jailhouse
from the pinkertons,

18:29.576 --> 18:31.175
They, you know,
had stripped it bare.

18:31.177 --> 18:33.444
Uh, yes, please, take that one.

18:33.446 --> 18:34.579
We have a spare in the shed.

18:34.581 --> 18:35.713
Thank you, ma'am.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.348
Forks?

18:37.350 --> 18:40.384
You take the forks,
he's getting the plates.

18:40.386 --> 18:41.486
Emily, come on, sweetheart,
it's dinner.

18:41.488 --> 18:42.653
Go say goodbye to the constable.

18:47.359 --> 18:49.193
As you were.

18:51.597 --> 18:53.464
Ready?

18:53.466 --> 18:54.532
One, two,
three, scooch!

18:54.534 --> 18:56.467
There we go.

18:59.605 --> 19:00.605
Jack!

19:00.607 --> 19:02.740
Wait a moment!

19:02.742 --> 19:04.809
One of my students,
rosaleen sullivan,

19:04.811 --> 19:06.210
She will not speak.

19:06.212 --> 19:07.612
She simply
will not say a word.

19:07.614 --> 19:08.646
I've been
working with her,

19:08.648 --> 19:09.747
And I believe

19:09.749 --> 19:11.349
She was on the verge
of a breakthrough,

19:11.351 --> 19:12.216
When we saw a man,
wendell backus--

19:12.218 --> 19:13.417
Slow down for a second.

19:14.620 --> 19:17.221
You big city folk
rattle a mile a minute.

19:17.223 --> 19:19.490
I'm just a country boy
who needs to understand this.

19:19.492 --> 19:22.360
I'm concerned
for one of my students.

19:22.362 --> 19:24.395
Rosaleen sullivan,
who doesn't speak,

19:24.397 --> 19:26.297
And why do you think mr. Backus
had something to do with that?

19:29.501 --> 19:30.635
When she saw him,

19:30.637 --> 19:31.669
He stared at her,

19:31.671 --> 19:33.437
And it was like
her blood froze.

19:33.439 --> 19:34.372
It just happened again.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.541
She saw him,

19:36.543 --> 19:38.809
And she just crawled
back into a shell.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.778
There's something
wrong here, I know it.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.780
Well, wendell's a drinker,
if that's what you mean,

19:42.782 --> 19:46.517
But so are other miners.

19:46.519 --> 19:47.518
It's more than that.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.287
Hmm.

19:49.289 --> 19:51.722
Well, working in a mine
can break a lot of men.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.591
It's not a pretty sight,

19:53.593 --> 19:55.259
But it doesn't mean
that he's a bad man.

19:55.261 --> 19:56.661
There's something wrong
about him

19:56.663 --> 19:58.596
And it's connected to
why rosaleen won't speak.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.268
How old is she?

20:04.270 --> 20:06.237
She's only eight.

20:09.608 --> 20:10.608
Okay.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.376
I'll talk to him.

20:15.280 --> 20:17.481
[children laugh and play]

20:43.709 --> 20:44.842
Hi.

20:44.844 --> 20:47.712
I'm glad you brought
your lunch today.

20:52.584 --> 20:53.718
When I was a girl,

20:53.720 --> 20:55.586
We called jacks
"knucklebones."

20:55.588 --> 20:57.521
My favorite game with them was
called "horse in the stable."

20:57.523 --> 20:58.589
Would you like to learn
how to play?

21:00.359 --> 21:02.760
Okay... You start with--

21:02.762 --> 21:03.794
[children shouting]

21:07.466 --> 21:09.600
I'll be right back.

21:09.602 --> 21:10.835

[shouting and arguing]

21:33.659 --> 21:34.759
Boys, stop it.

21:34.761 --> 21:35.893
Stop this immediately.

21:35.895 --> 21:36.827
That's enough!

21:37.896 --> 21:38.796
What happened?

21:38.798 --> 21:39.764
He stole my coins.

21:39.766 --> 21:40.765
Did not!

21:40.767 --> 21:41.799
They were on the ground!

21:41.801 --> 21:43.501
Yeah, but
I saw 'em first!

21:43.503 --> 21:44.769
Whatever happened,

21:44.771 --> 21:45.936
There will be no fisticuffs
on my watch.

21:45.938 --> 21:47.305
This is no way
to resolve a dispute.

21:47.307 --> 21:48.506
But they're mine!

21:48.508 --> 21:49.540
But I saw 'em first

21:49.542 --> 21:50.574
Did not!
They were on the ground!

21:50.576 --> 21:51.642
Call heads or tails.

21:53.645 --> 21:55.313
Heads.

22:02.454 --> 22:03.721
Oh, my...

22:09.394 --> 22:10.328
Rosaleen!

22:12.597 --> 22:13.731
Rosaleen!

22:19.404 --> 22:20.938
Okay...

22:20.940 --> 22:23.441
We're gonna do it this time,
are you ready?

22:23.443 --> 22:25.543
[barks]

22:25.545 --> 22:26.677
Okay, and...

22:26.679 --> 22:28.746
And... Fetch!

22:30.082 --> 22:31.749
Sorry, reverend.

22:34.820 --> 22:36.387
Have you ever seen
a less mobile dog?

22:38.890 --> 22:41.459
No, sir.

22:41.461 --> 22:42.693
I hope it's not catching.

22:42.695 --> 22:43.694
I beg your pardon?

22:43.696 --> 22:45.730
I am questioning the slow pace

22:45.732 --> 22:46.697
Of your investigation

22:46.699 --> 22:48.432
Into the church fire.

22:48.434 --> 22:50.835
I'm happy with my pace.

22:51.970 --> 22:53.437
Have you uncovered
anything of interest?

22:53.439 --> 22:55.773
I can't discuss
an ongoing investigation.

22:55.775 --> 22:56.774
Jack! Jack!

22:56.776 --> 22:57.975
Rosaleen is missing.

22:57.977 --> 22:59.710
The children were outside
for lunch,

22:59.712 --> 23:00.978
And the next thing I know,

23:00.980 --> 23:01.846
I see wendell's wagon
going down the road,

23:01.848 --> 23:03.447
And rosaleen is gone.

23:03.449 --> 23:04.715
-Okay, when did this happen?
-Just now.

23:04.717 --> 23:05.716
I told you about wendell.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.017
We don't know anything yet.

23:07.019 --> 23:08.753
Maybe she went back
to the schoolroom.

23:08.755 --> 23:09.854
Did you look there?

23:09.856 --> 23:10.755
Of course!
She wasn't there.

23:10.757 --> 23:12.523
Maybe she went home.

23:12.525 --> 23:14.592
Are you sure you're not
jumping to conclusions?

23:14.594 --> 23:16.494
Jack, I think he's taken her.

23:16.496 --> 23:17.862
[reverend]: I know
wendell backus.

23:17.864 --> 23:19.930
Ever since the explosion,
he's been a troubled soul.

23:19.932 --> 23:21.065
You should
hurry.

23:21.067 --> 23:22.533
Which way was
his wagon headed?

23:22.535 --> 23:23.868
Out of town.

23:23.870 --> 23:25.669
I think he was headed
west out of town.

23:25.671 --> 23:26.737
Okay, go back to the classroom.
She might return there.

23:26.739 --> 23:27.805
I'll track down wendell.

23:27.807 --> 23:29.006
Go!

23:29.008 --> 23:30.641
Is there anything
I can do to help?

23:30.643 --> 23:32.610
Start knocking on doors
on main street,

23:32.612 --> 23:33.677
See if anyone
saw something.

23:46.792 --> 23:48.759
[banging on door]
wendell!

23:48.761 --> 23:49.827
Wendell backus!

23:51.963 --> 23:53.597
What do you want?

23:55.500 --> 23:56.634
Say, what are you doin'?

23:56.636 --> 23:59.503
Looking for
a missing child.

23:59.505 --> 24:00.771
Rosaleen! You here?

24:00.773 --> 24:02.106
I don't
know nothin'.

24:02.108 --> 24:04.508
Hey, this is
my house!

24:04.510 --> 24:06.510
Rosaleen?

24:06.512 --> 24:07.645
Move.

24:07.647 --> 24:10.581
What's goin' on?

24:10.583 --> 24:11.982
I need you to sober up

24:11.984 --> 24:13.784
Right now, wendell.

24:13.786 --> 24:15.186
You bust in here...
I ain't bothered you.

24:15.188 --> 24:18.656
There is a little girl,
rosaleen sullivan.

24:18.658 --> 24:20.791
You know her?

24:20.793 --> 24:22.660
She went missing
from school today.

24:22.662 --> 24:24.595
Do you know anything about that?

24:24.597 --> 24:25.763
No. No, of course not.

24:27.566 --> 24:29.700
You got no right to accuse me.

24:29.702 --> 24:30.868
You tell me
what you know.

24:30.870 --> 24:32.136
Nothin'.

24:32.138 --> 24:33.537
I ain't known
nothin' my whole life.

24:33.539 --> 24:35.206
If you're lying to me--

24:35.208 --> 24:36.574
What?
What can you do to me

24:36.576 --> 24:37.875
That's worse than
my life is now?

24:37.877 --> 24:39.076
If I find out

24:39.078 --> 24:40.678
That little girl is missing

24:40.680 --> 24:41.612
Because of something
you've done...

24:43.081 --> 24:44.682
I will personally see to it

24:44.684 --> 24:45.883
You are locked away
in medicine hat prison,

24:45.885 --> 24:48.085
Shackled to the wall
of a stone-cold cell

24:48.087 --> 24:51.555
For the rest
of your miserable life.

24:51.557 --> 24:54.658
I didn't do nothing, I swear.

24:56.995 --> 25:02.800
Your eyes are telling me
a different story.

25:04.703 --> 25:06.871
The story...

25:06.873 --> 25:08.973
It was a day a while back,

25:08.975 --> 25:12.176
A day I...

25:12.178 --> 25:15.913
Sometimes, liquor
gets the best of me.

25:15.915 --> 25:17.615
I had a few too many
a while back,

25:17.617 --> 25:18.849
And I saw
that little irish girl,

25:18.851 --> 25:21.118
And I asked her what day it was.

25:21.120 --> 25:22.853
She didn't answer.

25:22.855 --> 25:25.122
She was being disrespectful.

25:25.124 --> 25:26.790
I'm an old mine hog.

25:26.792 --> 25:27.992
I'm not much,

25:27.994 --> 25:28.893
But you should show
some respect.

25:28.895 --> 25:30.027
I have earned some respect!

25:30.029 --> 25:31.929
So, what did you do to her?

25:31.931 --> 25:33.998
Nothin', really.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.132
I raised my hand to her.

25:35.134 --> 25:36.734
She drew back,

25:36.736 --> 25:37.868
And I could see
how scared she was,

25:37.870 --> 25:40.604
But I swear,
I never hit her, never.

25:43.909 --> 25:46.577
But I know I put the fear of god
into her that day.

25:47.779 --> 25:51.882
Oh, you put the fear
of a very flawed man in her.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.884
Not god.

25:53.886 --> 25:57.221
I shouldn't even
be alive.

25:57.223 --> 26:00.691
I should've died in that mine
with the rest of them.

26:02.761 --> 26:04.094
I was sick that day,

26:04.096 --> 26:09.033
So my best friend
worked the shift for me.

26:09.035 --> 26:11.001
It's like I killed him myself.

26:12.237 --> 26:13.771
And ever since,

26:13.773 --> 26:15.706
You've been
doing your best to die.

26:15.708 --> 26:17.041
Drink yourself to death.

26:17.043 --> 26:18.842
That's about right.

26:20.078 --> 26:22.913
Maybe you were spared
for a reason.

26:22.915 --> 26:25.883
It's not to late to do something
good with your life, wendell.

26:58.817 --> 27:00.718
Did rosaleen
have a favorite place

27:00.720 --> 27:02.886
Where she might
have gone?

27:04.823 --> 27:06.957
She's a smart girl.

27:06.959 --> 27:07.992
I think she'll be
sitting with us

27:07.994 --> 27:08.959
Tomorrow morning,

27:08.961 --> 27:10.027
Right there in her spot.

27:12.297 --> 27:15.165
Class, open your readers
to chapter seven, please,

27:15.167 --> 27:16.700
And read on your own.

27:18.036 --> 27:19.703
[quietly]
I found wendell.

27:19.705 --> 27:21.105
She wasn't there.

27:21.107 --> 27:22.106
I don't think he knows
where she is.

27:22.108 --> 27:23.974
Then I went by
the sullivan home.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.709
She hasn't turned up.

27:25.711 --> 27:26.877
Molly and some of
the other mothers

27:26.879 --> 27:28.012
Are searching
right now.

27:28.014 --> 27:30.280
Poor molly.

27:30.282 --> 27:32.116
Most coal valley kids, they can
take care of themselves,

27:32.118 --> 27:33.150
But from what you've told me

27:33.152 --> 27:34.752
About rosaleen--

27:34.754 --> 27:35.786
I think we need
an all-out search.

27:35.788 --> 27:37.655
I think you're right.

27:39.991 --> 27:41.058
Rosaleen!

27:42.060 --> 27:43.994
Rosaleen!

27:43.996 --> 27:46.030
[searchers shout]

27:46.032 --> 27:47.097
Rosaleen!

27:50.068 --> 27:51.669
[calls echo]

28:02.147 --> 28:04.081
Rosaleen!

28:07.786 --> 28:11.989
[searchers call out]

28:22.333 --> 28:23.701
Whoa...

28:25.170 --> 28:26.236
I'd like to help.

28:27.772 --> 28:30.774
It's good to have you with us.

28:33.078 --> 28:34.978
Rosaleen!

28:36.781 --> 28:39.049
Rosaleen!

28:39.051 --> 28:40.984
Rosaleen!

28:41.986 --> 28:42.953
Anything at the south end?

28:42.955 --> 28:44.054
Nothing.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.055
Aw, get some rest.

28:45.057 --> 28:46.056
You'll need it
for the morning.

28:46.058 --> 28:48.092
How can I rest?

28:48.094 --> 28:50.928
I'll never be able to rest
when she's out there somewhere.

28:50.930 --> 28:52.863
She could be in trouble.

28:52.865 --> 28:55.099
No, I'll not rest now,
or ever until I find her.

28:55.101 --> 28:57.067
Rosaleen!

28:57.069 --> 28:58.969
Rosaleen,
my darling!

28:58.971 --> 29:00.838
We keep looking.

29:00.840 --> 29:03.073
Okay, some of you,
follow molly,

29:03.075 --> 29:07.044
And the rest of us,
let's check the east side.

29:09.347 --> 29:11.115
I'll head to the school.

29:11.117 --> 29:14.351
Maybe she made her way there...

29:21.392 --> 29:24.294
Rosaleen?

29:28.867 --> 29:30.167
[sighing]

29:37.442 --> 29:39.176
[sighs shakily]

29:46.851 --> 29:48.318
Oh...

29:55.994 --> 29:57.194
Rosaleen!

30:06.204 --> 30:08.338
[quietly] rosaleen?

30:21.886 --> 30:24.822
Rosaleen?

30:25.924 --> 30:27.858
Rosaleen?

30:47.345 --> 30:51.248
Rosaleen?

30:51.250 --> 30:55.052
[soft crying in the distance]

30:55.054 --> 30:56.386
Rosaleen...

30:59.123 --> 31:00.324
[gasps in relief]

31:00.326 --> 31:01.325
Rosaleen...

31:01.327 --> 31:03.327
Oh, my god.

31:03.329 --> 31:04.461
Oh, you're okay.

31:04.463 --> 31:06.330
It's okay, it's okay.

31:06.332 --> 31:08.332
I'm here now.
You're all right.

31:08.334 --> 31:10.100
You're all right.

31:10.102 --> 31:12.002
[sighing in relief,
rosaleen still sobbing]

31:12.004 --> 31:13.403
Oh, sweetheart,

31:13.405 --> 31:18.208
I am so glad I found you.

31:18.210 --> 31:19.243
The whole town has been out
looking for you.

31:19.245 --> 31:20.410
Did you know that?

31:22.213 --> 31:23.480
Oh, you're safe now.

31:23.482 --> 31:24.615
You're safe.

31:29.220 --> 31:30.254
Rosaleen,

31:30.256 --> 31:32.990
I found
your picture,

31:32.992 --> 31:36.093
And I think I know
why you came here.

31:36.095 --> 31:39.997
You wanted to bring your daddy
his lunch, didn't you?

31:39.999 --> 31:42.232
I...

31:42.234 --> 31:43.433
I...

31:46.371 --> 31:48.171
I didn't bring him his lunch.

31:50.408 --> 31:54.978
That day, my friend, anna,
asked me to play.

31:54.980 --> 31:56.246
I wanted to play

31:56.248 --> 31:58.382
And I didn't bring him
his lunch.

32:00.018 --> 32:02.319
Then the boom came.

32:02.321 --> 32:04.521
Oh...

32:04.523 --> 32:05.522
Sweetheart,

32:05.524 --> 32:08.458
Look at me.

32:08.460 --> 32:10.527
It is not your fault

32:10.529 --> 32:12.396
That your daddy lost his life
in this mine.

32:15.266 --> 32:17.134
What will mommy say

32:17.136 --> 32:19.937
When she finds out
I didn't bring him his lunch?

32:21.339 --> 32:24.141
She will tell you

32:24.143 --> 32:27.344
That she loves you
more than life itself.

32:29.414 --> 32:30.414
All right,

32:30.416 --> 32:33.984
It's time to go home now.

32:38.189 --> 32:39.222
[sobbing and shivering]

32:52.437 --> 32:54.037
Mommy!

32:54.039 --> 32:55.305
Mommy!

32:58.242 --> 32:59.176
Rosa--

32:59.178 --> 33:00.510
Mommy!

33:01.980 --> 33:04.214
Rosaleen.

33:04.216 --> 33:06.316
Mommy!

33:08.586 --> 33:11.054
They've found her...

33:11.056 --> 33:13.056
They've found her!

33:15.226 --> 33:16.226
<i>[elizabeth writes]:</i>
<i>The searchers</i>

33:16.228 --> 33:17.728

33:17.730 --> 33:20.197

33:31.610 --> 33:34.444
[â™ª]

33:47.225 --> 33:49.026
I'm sorry, mommy.

33:51.529 --> 33:53.196
I love you.

33:54.532 --> 33:57.100
I love you.

33:58.269 --> 34:01.171
Oh, dear little one,
I love you so.

34:24.429 --> 34:30.100
<i>The light of love</i>
<i>restores every lost voice.</i>

34:39.410 --> 34:40.477
Can anyone say this?

34:43.181 --> 34:44.414
Gabe?

34:46.184 --> 34:48.485
"sol...

34:48.487 --> 34:51.421
Omnibus lucet."

34:51.423 --> 34:53.156
Very good, gabe.

34:53.158 --> 34:55.225
"sol omnibus lucet."

34:57.228 --> 34:59.463
Rosaleen, would you
like to guess

34:59.465 --> 35:02.132
What the word
"sol" means?

35:05.436 --> 35:06.570
Does it mean "sun"?

35:06.572 --> 35:08.305
Yes.

35:08.307 --> 35:12.642
[everyone applauds]

35:19.450 --> 35:22.586
This means
"the sun shines for everyone."

35:22.588 --> 35:23.587
That's all for today.

35:23.589 --> 35:26.123
Enjoy the sunshine.

35:35.399 --> 35:37.200
A very good lesson.

35:37.202 --> 35:39.236
Thank you.

35:39.238 --> 35:42.239
I, uh...

35:42.241 --> 35:44.608
I owe you an apology.

35:44.610 --> 35:46.510
For what?

35:46.512 --> 35:48.211
For jumping to conclusions
about your character

35:48.213 --> 35:51.548
When I first
got to town.

35:51.550 --> 35:53.416
[chuckles]

35:53.418 --> 35:56.253
But last night,
once again,

35:56.255 --> 35:58.421
You proved me...

35:58.423 --> 35:59.689
"erro."

35:59.691 --> 36:00.624
Ah...

36:00.626 --> 36:01.758
The latin word

36:01.760 --> 36:03.827
For "mistaken."

36:03.829 --> 36:05.762
You know latin, do you?

36:05.764 --> 36:08.298
A little.

36:08.300 --> 36:09.733
For instance, "bella."

36:12.503 --> 36:13.503
Oh.

36:13.505 --> 36:16.506
Did I pronounce that correctly?

36:16.508 --> 36:20.710
Yes, I believe you did.

36:25.316 --> 36:29.653
Well, there's also "pergisci."

36:31.556 --> 36:34.658
I'm afraid
I don't know that one.

36:34.660 --> 36:36.326
Also, why are you whispering?

36:38.796 --> 36:41.798
[whispering] it means...

36:41.800 --> 36:43.333
"wake up."

36:53.544 --> 36:56.680
Take this over to ned
at the mercantile.

37:00.318 --> 37:01.618
Reverend,

37:01.620 --> 37:03.286
Thank heaven,
they found that little girl.

37:03.288 --> 37:05.622
Yeah, it's a true miracle.

37:05.624 --> 37:06.723
I see that
you're making some progress.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.558
Mr. Spurlock tells me

37:08.560 --> 37:09.626
That the constable is
investigating the church fire.

37:09.628 --> 37:11.328
Yes.

37:11.330 --> 37:13.430
Well, hopefully, there will be
a quick arrest

37:13.432 --> 37:14.397
And a resolution to this matter.

37:16.434 --> 37:19.302
Now, I know that you want me
to build you a new church--

37:19.304 --> 37:20.604
About the church--

37:20.606 --> 37:21.605
But with
the perpetrator

37:21.607 --> 37:22.973
Put away,

37:22.975 --> 37:25.375
Be it cat montgomery,
or whomever,

37:25.377 --> 37:26.910
I'll certainly feel
more inspired

37:26.912 --> 37:28.712
To build you
a new place of worship.

37:28.714 --> 37:30.313
I don't want that.

37:30.315 --> 37:32.482
Gathering together

37:32.484 --> 37:34.384
To praise the lord,

37:34.386 --> 37:36.586
Worship in his name,

37:36.588 --> 37:38.355
Doesn't require a building.

37:38.357 --> 37:41.791
You were the one who's been
pestering me about it.

37:41.793 --> 37:44.594
Now, if you wish
to continue to preach

37:44.596 --> 37:45.595
At the saloon,

37:45.597 --> 37:46.930
That's fine by me,

37:46.932 --> 37:49.866
As long as everyone
continues to move forward,

37:49.868 --> 37:51.635
And people have their minds
taken off the...

37:51.637 --> 37:53.270
Unfortunate mine disaster.

37:55.873 --> 37:59.542
I blamed a poor widow
for burning down my church

37:59.544 --> 38:01.378
And stealing my parishioners.

38:01.380 --> 38:03.413
Well, it certainly appears

38:03.415 --> 38:04.514
That that's exactly
what's happened.

38:04.516 --> 38:06.016
I have no idea

38:06.018 --> 38:08.318
Whether cat montgomery
burned down that church or not.

38:09.787 --> 38:11.354
But even if she did,

38:11.356 --> 38:14.491
It's not my place to judge.

38:14.493 --> 38:16.493
I came here looking for justice,

38:16.495 --> 38:19.763
As if that church
belonged to me,

38:19.765 --> 38:22.832
As if it was
my personal property--

38:22.834 --> 38:24.567
But it never was.

38:26.504 --> 38:27.704
The church belongs
to the people,

38:27.706 --> 38:30.974
And I...

38:30.976 --> 38:33.943
I am supposed to be
their humble servant.

38:33.945 --> 38:36.846
Well, so long as you
continue to do the job

38:36.848 --> 38:40.650
That I am paying you to do.

38:42.386 --> 38:44.387
"whereas I was blind,
but now I see."

38:45.856 --> 38:48.558
Gospel of john
9:1:11.

38:48.560 --> 38:51.795
I'm sorry, parson,
but I don't speak bible.

38:53.431 --> 38:55.532
I don't work for you anymore,
mr. Gowen.

38:55.534 --> 38:58.401
I am resigning
my position

38:58.403 --> 38:59.536
With the company.

38:59.538 --> 39:00.937
I hope the good people
of this town

39:00.939 --> 39:01.938
Can forgive me my weaknesses

39:01.940 --> 39:04.674
So I can go back to my calling--

39:04.676 --> 39:06.609
As their preacher.

39:07.678 --> 39:08.611
How are you going to do that

39:08.613 --> 39:10.547
Without a church?

39:10.549 --> 39:12.615
How are you going to
keep your flock together

39:12.617 --> 39:14.617
Without some kind of
financial backing

39:14.619 --> 39:16.353
And a place to preach?

39:17.822 --> 39:22.625
Where god guides,
god provides.

40:03.901 --> 40:05.602
Is your mother home?

40:05.604 --> 40:07.804
She's in back,
gardening.

40:09.673 --> 40:10.673
Thanks.

40:16.647 --> 40:19.015
Mind hanging onto
this guy for a minute?

40:19.017 --> 40:20.784
Yes, sir.

40:20.786 --> 40:22.552
You're getting
good at that.

40:22.554 --> 40:24.154
Thanks.

40:35.666 --> 40:36.766
Hi there.

40:36.768 --> 40:37.901
Hi.

40:37.903 --> 40:41.504
I came to return this.

40:41.506 --> 40:42.572
I have one of my own now,

40:42.574 --> 40:43.907
But thank you
for the loan.

40:43.909 --> 40:45.442
Oh, you're welcome.

40:45.444 --> 40:46.643
You can just put it
in the shed for now.

40:46.645 --> 40:47.844
Yes, ma'am.

41:27.551 --> 41:29.886
[humming peacefully]

41:34.825 --> 41:38.628
