MAN:
I'm gonna take
all these teddy bears, man.

00:27.328 --> 00:30.362
You're gonna need a lot more.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.464
Let's see.

Come on, man.

00:38.239 --> 00:39.805
How many teddy bears
you need, huh?

00:39.807 --> 00:41.924
Come on,<i> payaso.</i>

00:41.925 --> 00:44.042
Hey, let me tell you something.
You play your little games.

00:44.045 --> 00:46.512
I want my paper.
You give me my money, hear?

00:46.514 --> 00:48.514
Yo, Hector, chill out, man.

00:48.516 --> 00:51.150
Don't worry.
You're gonna get paid.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.052
Don't worry about it.
I don't want
to chill.

00:53.054 --> 00:54.386
I want my money.

00:54.388 --> 00:55.654
(<i> gun fires</i> )

00:56.390 --> 00:57.523
Ahh!

00:57.525 --> 01:00.325
<i> Payaso,</i> this is fixed, man.

01:02.229 --> 01:06.298
I was your age, I thought about
two things all the time.

01:06.300 --> 01:08.267
Women and...?

01:08.269 --> 01:10.069
Money.

01:10.071 --> 01:12.404
Now what do you
think about?

01:12.406 --> 01:14.339
Money...

01:14.341 --> 01:16.442
and women.

01:28.422 --> 01:29.855
LOPEZ:
How do you figure?

01:29.857 --> 01:33.392
I got 20 years in.
I retire, I get
half my paycheck.

01:33.394 --> 01:36.395
I work-- all I'm working
for is the other half.

01:36.397 --> 01:38.330
Retire to Hawaii.

01:38.332 --> 01:40.432
With my pension,
I live like a king.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.334
You'll still
be a fat cop.

I don't know.

02:00.588 --> 02:02.321
(<i> indistinct murmuring</i> )

02:08.462 --> 02:12.231
Okay! Who saw the shooting?

02:12.233 --> 02:13.732
You?

02:13.734 --> 02:15.334
<i> Nada.</i>

02:15.336 --> 02:18.203
<i>Yo, no he visto nada.</i>

04:00.341 --> 04:03.308
You happened to be in front,

04:03.310 --> 04:05.711
It was bang,
bang, bang.

04:05.713 --> 04:07.879
By the time
I got there

04:07.881 --> 04:10.616
it was just him
on the ground.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.751
It's very dark.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.786
It's very dark
out here.

04:17.791 --> 04:20.325
(<i> exasperated sigh</i> )

04:20.327 --> 04:21.760
Excuse me.

Let's go play.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.532
We're batting a thousand.

04:26.533 --> 04:28.267
All our witnesses
are deaf, dumb and blind.

04:28.269 --> 04:29.835
What did I tell you?

04:29.837 --> 04:31.870
The guy didn't really
get shot.

04:31.872 --> 04:34.006
Upstairs?
They take a look?

04:34.008 --> 04:37.576
Here? A .38 going off is
background music for dinner.

04:37.578 --> 04:40.279
An imaginary killing,
but a real body.

04:40.281 --> 04:41.980
No I.D. except this.

04:43.784 --> 04:46.285
Hell, he's a dealer.
No wonder no one's talking.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.926
Damn it.
Where did that come from?

04:54.928 --> 04:58.430
Was it in his hand

04:58.432 --> 05:01.433
or in the waistband?
STUART:
I didn't see.

05:03.704 --> 05:05.671
Terrific.

05:06.974 --> 05:09.341
Not fired.

05:11.445 --> 05:12.911
What do you call that?

05:14.348 --> 05:15.614
A lesson.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.949
Pay for your drugs,
or we'll kill you.

05:17.951 --> 05:21.820
Ah, this is personal.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.922
And this is trouble in court.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.726
The waist, the hand--
what's the difference?

05:27.728 --> 05:29.728
He's shot in the back
and in the crotch.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.797
Chicken or egg--
which came first?

05:31.799 --> 05:33.665
That's important?

05:35.002 --> 05:37.869
Just wait.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.871
Your victim? Lovely guy.

05:39.873 --> 05:41.340
Urbano, Jose.

05:41.342 --> 05:44.810
Robbery, rape at 15,
year in Spofford.

05:44.812 --> 05:47.746
Assaults,
two narcotics felonies,

05:47.748 --> 05:49.748
three stops at Attica.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.350
What? No homicides?

05:51.352 --> 05:53.752
GREEVEY:
Get this--
no witnesses.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.887
40-odd interviews.<i> Nada.</i>

05:55.889 --> 05:56.855
Nothing?

05:56.857 --> 05:58.724
They don't want an arrest.

05:58.726 --> 06:01.793
The carny operator, he says
a guy gave Urbano money.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.895
About six feet tall
with a moustache.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.964
He ought to come walking in
any minute.

06:05.966 --> 06:07.866
You sure this isn't about drugs?

06:07.868 --> 06:10.402
Doesn't play that way.
Not four in the crotch.

06:10.404 --> 06:11.803
That's sexual.

06:11.805 --> 06:14.840
Okay, I give up.
Why?

06:14.842 --> 06:16.475
(<i> sighs</i> )

06:16.477 --> 06:18.710
Urbano had six months
more parole.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.779
Find out
who his business was.

06:20.781 --> 06:23.081
You know,
like an investigation.

06:25.953 --> 06:28.954
MAN:
<i> The slugs are from a Glock.</i>

06:28.956 --> 06:30.856
LOGAN:
Awfully expensive automatic
for the barrio.

06:30.858 --> 06:31.990
This one...

06:31.992 --> 06:33.859
real crisp rifling
on all the slugs.

06:33.861 --> 06:37.829
Must be almost brand new.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.431
Run a check, anyhow, huh?

06:39.433 --> 06:42.000
find a match.
See if you can

06:44.705 --> 06:46.772
MAN:
<i> May he rest in peace,</i>

06:46.774 --> 06:48.807
but on the scale
of living things

06:48.809 --> 06:51.410
our friend Jose
is just a couple of steps up

06:51.412 --> 06:53.011
from the snail.

06:53.013 --> 06:55.180
What's wrong with me?

06:55.182 --> 06:59.851
All I see is
the dark side of people.

06:59.853 --> 07:02.854
Was Urbano
still dealing?

07:02.856 --> 07:04.890
The charming Jose.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.825
New story every week.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.927
This job, that job.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.129
Somehow, they never worked out.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.999
He swore he was going straight.

07:14.001 --> 07:15.967
You believe him?

07:15.969 --> 07:17.502
Oh, absolutely.

07:17.504 --> 07:21.873
All my cons have been
rehabilitated by the system.

07:21.875 --> 07:24.009
You got an address?

07:24.011 --> 07:27.012
Had a sister with a kid.

07:27.014 --> 07:29.481
Lived with her sometimes.

07:29.483 --> 07:31.016
Gave her money.

07:31.018 --> 07:33.585
He wasn't<i> all</i> bad.

07:33.587 --> 07:39.024
First time Jose went to Attica,
I visited him.

07:39.026 --> 07:41.159
Have you ever been there?

07:41.161 --> 07:44.930
Doesn't look as bad
as on TV.

07:44.932 --> 07:49.134
$100 a week he gave me.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.536
For her.

07:52.940 --> 07:55.874
Night he died,
he won her a teddy bear.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.776
Where did he get the money?

07:57.778 --> 08:00.612
You were with Jose
Saturday night

08:00.614 --> 08:02.981
when he won the teddy bear?

08:02.983 --> 08:04.950
Anita...

08:04.952 --> 08:07.953
he was so good to you,
you don't care who whacked him?

08:07.955 --> 08:10.989
Look, Jose was
with Hector Cartagena.

08:10.991 --> 08:14.059
Hector and Jose had been
together in Attica.

08:14.061 --> 08:15.060
They argued.

08:15.062 --> 08:16.094
I came home.

08:16.096 --> 08:18.029
Argued? About what?

08:18.031 --> 08:19.965
A deal.

08:19.967 --> 08:22.200
Hector said Jose shorted him.

08:22.202 --> 08:26.004
And Hector said Jose
was no good to his friends.

08:26.006 --> 08:29.074
He was mad.
He wanted to kill him.

08:29.076 --> 08:32.244
Business.

08:35.048 --> 08:39.050
Cartagena's got narcotics,
arson, larceny

08:39.052 --> 08:42.020
armed robbery,
aggravated assault.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.589
Hey, listen,
thanks a lot, okay?

08:44.591 --> 08:46.892
Paroled from Attica
two months ago.

08:46.894 --> 08:49.060
Lives on 108th Street.
Let's go get a warrant.

08:49.062 --> 08:51.930
I don't want to see
this guy without back-up.

08:51.932 --> 08:55.200
Backup? I don't want to see him
without nuclear weapons.

08:55.202 --> 08:58.203
(<i> babycrying</i> )

09:01.642 --> 09:04.142
This isn't going
to give easy.

09:09.082 --> 09:10.982
HECTOR:
Yeah. Who is it?

09:10.984 --> 09:12.217
Con Ed--
gas leak.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.852
Police!

09:13.854 --> 09:16.221
Get over there!
Get your hands up.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.123
HECTOR:
I'm cool. All right.

09:18.125 --> 09:20.692
You're under arrest
for the murder of Jose Urbano.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.327
I don't kill nobody.

09:22.328 --> 09:23.961
You have the right
to remain silent and refuse

09:23.964 --> 09:26.264
to answer any questions.
Do you understand that?

09:28.001 --> 09:31.169
Anita says you wanted
to kill Jose.

09:33.040 --> 09:36.575
You believe that...?

09:36.577 --> 09:38.977
Look, use your head.

09:38.979 --> 09:41.079
Why would I do it, huh?

09:41.081 --> 09:45.116
I kill him,
I don't get the paper he owe me.

09:45.118 --> 09:47.085
All right?<i> Mucho dinero,</i> okay?

09:47.087 --> 09:49.321
You visit anyone
besides Jose last night?

09:49.323 --> 09:50.956
That's right, Hector.
Come up with an alibi.

09:50.958 --> 09:53.258
That's what
you're supposed to do now.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.160
I went home.

09:55.162 --> 09:56.261
Solo.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.729
You understand?

09:57.731 --> 10:00.999
Yeah. Did you lose the Glock
on the way?

10:01.001 --> 10:04.135
Look, no my style, okay?

10:04.137 --> 10:06.605
Never like automatic weapons.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.607
Can openers.

10:08.609 --> 10:11.643
Jamming on you all the time,
you know?

10:11.645 --> 10:15.080
You better hope we don't find
that can opener on the street.

10:15.082 --> 10:16.748
Oh, yeah?

10:16.750 --> 10:20.018
And what you going to do?

10:20.020 --> 10:23.622
You and your<i> compadre,</i> huh,
yougoing to prove it's mine?

10:23.624 --> 10:25.624
Come on.
You're wasting my time.

10:25.626 --> 10:27.258
Can I go now, all right?

10:27.260 --> 10:28.393
You can go home, sure.

10:28.395 --> 10:30.028
Right back to Attica.

10:30.030 --> 10:32.697
Attica, my ass, man.

10:32.699 --> 10:36.067
Your ass is grass,<i> hombre.</i>

10:36.069 --> 10:37.302
You're
on parole.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.304
You can't hang
with felons.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.306
Even dead ones.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.041
Yeah, right.

10:43.043 --> 10:45.143
Get this--

10:45.144 --> 10:47.244
good old Hector swears
we didn't Mirandize him.

10:47.247 --> 10:49.247
Not so dumb, this Hector, huh?

10:49.249 --> 10:52.283
Smart enough to know we
couldn't tie him to the
gun, but stupid enough

10:52.285 --> 10:55.286
to say he was gonna waste Jose
in front of Jose's sister?

10:57.324 --> 11:01.993
He crawled out of the same sewer
as the late Jose.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.729
No way the neighborhood's going
to protect him.

11:04.731 --> 11:06.097
He didn't do it.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.198
No.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.100
You got the file?

11:09.102 --> 11:11.102
The carny operator--

11:11.104 --> 11:13.672
what's his name, Harmon?
The one that described Hector...

11:13.674 --> 11:18.076
Let's walk him
down memory lane again.

11:18.078 --> 11:20.712
What do you want from me, huh?
I'm watching the till.

11:20.714 --> 11:23.348
The drug dealer's done shooting,
I'm on to the next.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.717
Oh! How do you know
he's a drug dealer?

11:25.719 --> 11:28.053
2,000 bucks in clothes
on his back,

11:28.055 --> 11:29.354
a couple gold rings.

11:29.356 --> 11:32.090
You really care
who killed this guy?

11:32.092 --> 11:34.125
I mean, come on, he's scum.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.127
Wait a minute. You think he's
scum, I think he's scum

11:36.129 --> 11:38.730
but he had a sister
who needed him

11:38.732 --> 11:41.099
and a six-year-old niece who
thinks he's Mister Rogers.

11:41.101 --> 11:44.169
This probably has nothing
to do with it,

11:44.171 --> 11:47.439
but the kid from the church,
the girl...

11:47.441 --> 11:49.074
Which girl is this?

11:49.076 --> 11:52.110
The one I paid my fee to.
Pretty kid-- Alicia.

11:52.112 --> 11:56.114
She comes by, checks,
makes sure everything's okay

11:56.116 --> 11:58.817
then she's talking
to the drug dealer.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.452
What's his name-- Jose?

12:00.454 --> 12:02.120
About what?

12:02.122 --> 12:04.122
You think
I listened?

12:04.124 --> 12:06.057
She was hanging on the guy

12:06.059 --> 12:09.194
like she was trying
to pick him up.

12:13.834 --> 12:16.868
GREEVEY:
<i> says you talked to Urbanor</i>

12:16.870 --> 12:18.303
at the fair.

12:18.305 --> 12:21.239
At a fair, I talk to a lot of
people.

12:21.241 --> 12:24.209
Way we heard it is you dragged
him off into the crowd

12:24.211 --> 12:26.778
and he never came back.
You know, just like
a Roach Motel--

12:26.780 --> 12:28.880
he checked in,
but he didn't check out.

12:28.882 --> 12:30.215
And it's a good thing.

12:30.217 --> 12:32.150
Cockroaches should be dead.

12:32.152 --> 12:35.420
Innocent people get hurt,
you don't come up here so quick.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.088
Innocent people?

12:37.090 --> 12:39.157
What was Urbano guilty of?

12:39.159 --> 12:40.792
Look, enough.

12:40.794 --> 12:42.293
I've heard of Urbano.

12:42.295 --> 12:43.294
Drug dealer.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.296
They kill each other, fine.

12:45.298 --> 12:46.765
We're better off.

12:46.767 --> 12:49.200
Strange thing
for a priest to say.

12:49.202 --> 12:52.403
Strange times to be a priest.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.305
Send in a couple of
Puerto Rican cops.

12:54.307 --> 12:56.174
Maybe they can open this up.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.909
You been reading a different
duty roster, Max?

12:57.911 --> 13:01.146
I got Puerto Rican detectives
I haven't noticed?

13:01.148 --> 13:04.415
The priest--
he knows where Alicia was.

13:04.417 --> 13:05.784
Rivers, Alicia.

13:05.786 --> 13:08.086
One misdemeanor--
smoking weed.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.788
You know, when I was a kid

13:09.790 --> 13:11.422
I put a baseball
through a windshield.

13:11.424 --> 13:15.093
I was shakingbefore
they started asking
me questions.

13:15.095 --> 13:18.797
This chick, she did Urbano?
I'd like to know what she
takes for her nerves.

13:18.799 --> 13:21.149
A kid with no record.

13:21.150 --> 13:23.500
She didn't get a ..9mm and shoot
a drug dealer, that's for sure.

13:23.503 --> 13:25.236
(<i> phone rings</i> )

13:25.238 --> 13:27.138
Cragen.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.807
Uh-huh.

13:28.809 --> 13:31.209
Thank you.

13:31.211 --> 13:32.477
Hurley in Ballistics.

13:32.479 --> 13:33.878
Your Glock?

13:33.880 --> 13:36.381
Not used in any other shooting.

13:36.383 --> 13:38.483
Hey, I went back a year.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.485
You want to go back two, three,
all right?

13:40.487 --> 13:42.954
I'd love the overtime,
but who's going to pay?

13:42.956 --> 13:45.824
Listen, go back two years
and while you're at it,

13:45.826 --> 13:47.492
see if you can access
the license division files

13:47.494 --> 13:48.960
on your computer.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.228
Why?

13:50.230 --> 13:52.080
Why?

13:52.081 --> 13:53.931
Because let's see if anybody
connected to this thing

13:53.934 --> 13:55.433
has a gun license, okay?

13:55.435 --> 13:57.902
Right, then we'll check
lottery winners.

13:57.904 --> 14:00.138
Well, I'm just
a cockeyed optimist.

14:00.140 --> 14:01.606
(<i> chuckles</i> )

14:01.608 --> 14:03.241
Max?
Hmm?

14:03.243 --> 14:04.475
Torres, the priest--
what's his first name?

14:04.477 --> 14:05.610
A priest?

14:05.612 --> 14:06.945
Uh-huh.

14:06.947 --> 14:08.413
Roberto.

14:13.253 --> 14:15.186
Nope.

14:17.157 --> 14:20.208
Put up Rivers.

14:20.209 --> 14:23.260
See if you got one within 20
blocks of East 113th Street.

14:33.273 --> 14:34.539
Rivers, Anna.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.174
55 years old.

14:36.176 --> 14:38.610
642 East
117th Street.

14:38.612 --> 14:42.413
Registered owner of a .9mm Glock
semi-automatic.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.249
Yes!

14:46.620 --> 14:50.021
(<i> salsa music playing</i> )

15:01.201 --> 15:02.667
My gun?

15:02.669 --> 15:04.235
They stole it.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.337
Is that right?
When?

15:06.339 --> 15:10.108
Couple of weeks ago.
They broke in.

15:10.110 --> 15:13.211
Law says, if a gun is stolen,
you have to report it.

15:13.213 --> 15:14.612
Did you?

15:14.614 --> 15:16.314
Why bother?

15:16.316 --> 15:18.583
Would you have investigated

15:18.585 --> 15:21.119
or written a piece
of paper on it?

15:21.121 --> 15:23.655
Look, the gun was licensed,
and it was stolen.

15:23.657 --> 15:26.090
You want me to prove it wasn't?

15:26.092 --> 15:28.660
She goes to all the trouble
of getting a license

15:28.662 --> 15:30.995
but when her gun's stolen,
she doesn't replace it.

15:30.997 --> 15:32.330
I don't understand it.

15:32.332 --> 15:35.199
Next time she goes
to the bank deposit

15:35.201 --> 15:37.201
what's she going to do?

15:37.203 --> 15:40.672
Look, somebody killed a man
with a .9mm Glock

15:40.674 --> 15:42.607
just like yours.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.342
We find out it was
the same gun

15:44.344 --> 15:47.011
we're gonna wonder
why you didn't
report a burglary.

15:47.013 --> 15:50.048
Your granddaughter, Alicia--

15:50.050 --> 15:52.717
was she here the night
of the burglary?

15:52.719 --> 15:55.620
The night your gun got stolen?

15:59.592 --> 16:02.226
No, she wasn't.

16:05.332 --> 16:07.165
(<i> knocking at door</i> )

16:07.167 --> 16:10.168
(<i> footsteps</i> )

16:10.170 --> 16:11.703
Hey, hey, folks.

16:11.705 --> 16:14.172
Folks, you know
the Rivers family?

16:14.174 --> 16:15.707
Nope.

16:15.709 --> 16:17.408
Seen Alicia
tonight?

16:17.410 --> 16:19.010
Now you come?

16:19.012 --> 16:20.144
Three days later

16:20.146 --> 16:22.413
you want to know
where she is?

16:22.415 --> 16:24.415
She's at Central
Harlem Hospital.

16:24.417 --> 16:26.150
What?
Alicia's hurt?

16:26.152 --> 16:27.685
No, not Alicia,
her sister.

16:27.687 --> 16:30.154
What are you guys
doing here?

16:30.156 --> 16:31.689
Hey, we're looking
for Alicia.

16:31.691 --> 16:34.659
Lucy got beat up,
not Alicia.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.396
Six gunshots, four stabbings,

16:38.398 --> 16:41.632
baby who almost starved
to death-- slow night.

16:41.634 --> 16:44.202
You got a patient
named Rivers?

16:44.204 --> 16:45.370
Lucy Rivers?

16:45.372 --> 16:47.672
What the hell's the matter with
you cops?

16:47.674 --> 16:49.640
Just 'cause she couldn't talk
the first night

16:49.642 --> 16:51.476
you never come back?

16:51.478 --> 16:54.746
Somebody turned that girl
into mashed potatoes.

16:54.748 --> 16:56.481
Was she raped?

16:56.483 --> 16:58.649
She said she was mugged.

16:58.651 --> 17:00.218
Family honor.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.753
You didn't administer
a rape kit?

17:01.755 --> 17:04.689
I told you,
she said she wasn't raped.

17:04.691 --> 17:07.658
I told the grandmother,
the boyfriend.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.660
I told the damn priest.

17:09.662 --> 17:12.697
The girl's gonna need help
to get over this.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.700
They say patch her up
and get her home.

17:15.702 --> 17:20.104
The priest who was with her--
his name Torres?

17:20.106 --> 17:22.807
Is this nursery school?
I took roll call?

17:22.809 --> 17:25.109
612. The boyfriend's there.

17:25.111 --> 17:26.377
You fight with him.

17:26.379 --> 17:30.148
Lucy can't remember anything.

17:30.150 --> 17:33.184
That's why we told the cops
not to come back.

17:33.186 --> 17:36.054
We're sorry
about your girlfriend,

17:36.056 --> 17:39.524
but we have to talk
to her sister, Alicia.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.459
Alicia? Why?

17:41.461 --> 17:44.262
She around, Nicky?
Yeah, she's, um...

17:44.264 --> 17:46.264
She's downstairs.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.799
She's coming back.

17:47.801 --> 17:50.068
You go to the church fair
on Saturday night?

17:50.070 --> 17:51.736
No, no.

17:51.738 --> 17:56.507
I was here all night with Lucy.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.743
You're a little late
to help my sister.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.545
You didn't mention that
she was hurt.

18:00.547 --> 18:03.247
You were worried
about a drug dealer.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.249
the nurses if you
So, Nicky, we ask

18:05.251 --> 18:07.418
were around Saturday night,
they're gonna say yes, right?

18:07.420 --> 18:09.821
He came to the fair
for an hour.

18:09.823 --> 18:11.823
No, I was going to go.
I stayed here.

18:11.825 --> 18:15.560
You never heard
of Jose Urbano, right?

18:15.562 --> 18:18.529
Somebody shot him--
that's all I've heard.

18:18.531 --> 18:20.531
All I've heard
is that you have been

18:20.533 --> 18:23.301
in two places at the same time
Saturday night.

18:23.303 --> 18:26.471
Come on, Nicky.
Let's sit with Lucy.

18:28.274 --> 18:31.375
your beeper.
Dr. Wise, please check
WOMAN (<i> over P.A.</i> ):

18:31.377 --> 18:35.379
Dr. Wise, please check
your beeper.

18:35.381 --> 18:36.781
You know what
we have here?

18:36.783 --> 18:38.749
Exactly what we had
two weeks ago-- squat.

18:38.751 --> 18:39.817
It's like
the Bible.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.419
Oh?
The Gospels.

18:41.421 --> 18:44.188
Four guys that are all
telling the same story,

18:44.190 --> 18:45.990
except each one
of them's different.

18:45.991 --> 18:47.791
Nicky was at the church;
no, he was at the hospital.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.327
The gun was stolen;
no, it wasn't.

18:49.329 --> 18:51.462
The sister was raped;
no, she was just beat up.

18:51.464 --> 18:54.765
Alicia lured Urbano away;
Alicia didn't kill Urbano.

18:54.767 --> 18:58.436
The only thing that makes sense
is that Urbano raped Lucy

18:58.438 --> 19:00.338
and Guzman shot him--
pure revenge.

19:00.340 --> 19:01.539
Guzman, Nicky.

19:01.541 --> 19:03.441
Couple of juveniles,
shoplifting.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.844
No guns, no felonies.

19:05.845 --> 19:08.246
GREEVEY:
Even if the kid did it, we got
a hole here the size of Tulsa.

19:08.248 --> 19:11.182
Like why did Urbano rape
Nicky's girlfriend?

19:11.184 --> 19:13.484
What, a guy like Urbano needs a
motive for rape?

19:13.486 --> 19:15.786
What about the vic?
You talk to her yet?

19:15.788 --> 19:17.455
Hard to get her alone.

19:17.457 --> 19:20.925
Go after visiting hours.

19:23.196 --> 19:26.564
Can you tell us what happened?

19:26.566 --> 19:28.332
A man...

19:28.334 --> 19:29.567
he took my purse.

19:29.569 --> 19:31.502
I didn't see him.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.604
Where did this happen, Lucy?

19:33.606 --> 19:36.641
109th Street and Lexington.

19:36.643 --> 19:38.576
That's a bright corner.

19:38.578 --> 19:41.579
You didn't get a look
at his face?

19:42.515 --> 19:44.582
No.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.651
Lucy,
do you know

19:46.653 --> 19:48.920
who Jose Urbano was?

19:48.922 --> 19:54.392
He's from around
the neighborhood, I guess.

19:54.394 --> 19:57.595
Was it Jose Urbano
who attacked you?

20:04.270 --> 20:06.237
(<i> whispers</i> ):
No.

20:06.239 --> 20:08.239
When Mr. Urbano
takes a purse

20:08.241 --> 20:10.241
he does a lot
of damage.

20:10.243 --> 20:13.477
You find anybody
who heard what was going on?

20:13.479 --> 20:14.946
Mm-hmm. Julie Reyes.

20:14.948 --> 20:17.582
She was born here,
but she knows the language.

20:17.584 --> 20:19.483
Julia, honey, in case you don't

20:19.485 --> 20:21.485
recognize
these suits, these men are cops.

20:21.487 --> 20:24.222
Sergeant Greevey,
Detective Logan.

20:24.224 --> 20:27.592
You were on duty
when Lucy Rivers
was brought in?

20:27.594 --> 20:29.594
That night, the next day.

20:29.596 --> 20:31.562
What was all
the yelling about?

20:31.564 --> 20:34.232
I didn't hear all of it.

20:34.234 --> 20:37.902
The sister and the boyfriend--
they were so upset.

20:37.904 --> 20:41.539
The boyfriend kept yelling,
"How could he do it?"

20:41.541 --> 20:44.508
What about the priest, Torres?

20:44.510 --> 20:46.611
You know him?

20:48.514 --> 20:49.914
Yeah, well, we, uh...

20:49.916 --> 20:52.583
we pray at his church sometimes.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.552
Down at the soda machine

20:54.554 --> 20:57.321
he took the boyfriend aside.

20:57.323 --> 20:59.590
He was yelling at him,

20:59.592 --> 21:02.593
saying God would not
forgive them.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.029
TORRES:
This isn't Nazi Germany.

21:05.031 --> 21:07.498
You can't act
like storm troopers

21:07.500 --> 21:09.900
terrorizing my parishioners,
accusing them of crimes!

21:09.902 --> 21:12.637
You're not playing it
straight with us, Father.

21:12.639 --> 21:14.372
A nurse overheard your
conversation with Nicky.

21:14.374 --> 21:15.740
Knowing the streets
the way you do,

21:15.742 --> 21:18.309
Father, you probably know the
law, right?

21:18.311 --> 21:19.610
Cover up a crime?

21:19.612 --> 21:21.479
That's a crime, too.

21:21.481 --> 21:23.614
Oh, you care so much about
crime? They left a body

21:23.616 --> 21:25.683
in my church last year,
dead on the altar!

21:25.685 --> 21:27.351
They do that in your church?

21:27.353 --> 21:30.288
In my church
two kids don't plan a murder

21:30.290 --> 21:32.390
in front of their priest.

21:32.392 --> 21:35.660
The law considers that
accessory and conspiracy.

21:35.662 --> 21:38.029
You have something to tell us?

21:38.031 --> 21:40.498
They say
confession's good

21:40.500 --> 21:42.633
for the soul.

21:42.635 --> 21:45.503
Look, why don't you just forget
about this?

21:45.505 --> 21:48.673
How many murders do you have
never get solved?

21:48.675 --> 21:50.941
Why don't you just let this be
one of them?

21:50.943 --> 21:52.743
I'm waiting for offers.

21:52.745 --> 21:57.014
Two weeks, all expenses paid
in downtown Altoona.

21:57.016 --> 21:59.016
What do you got?
The Glock? Mrs. Rivers?

21:59.018 --> 22:02.053
18 months ago,
in a fight in her club

22:02.055 --> 22:03.654
she winged a guy.

22:03.656 --> 22:06.557
And it matches
the slugs in Urbano.

22:06.559 --> 22:08.459
Ha!

22:08.461 --> 22:10.061
A lot of maybes.

22:10.063 --> 22:12.530
You got motive,
the gun, the priest

22:12.532 --> 22:15.633
the girl leading Urbano
out of the church.

22:15.635 --> 22:17.101
What did
Torres say?

22:17.103 --> 22:20.438
Loosely translated? Go to hell.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.557
Tough to sell.

22:22.558 --> 22:24.675
CRAGEN:
You don't arrest somebody
now then kiss it good-bye.

22:24.677 --> 22:27.445
The memory lapses
these guys are getting,

22:27.447 --> 22:29.680
two weeks-- nobody's gonna
remember Urbano's name.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.082
And the Guzman kid?

22:31.084 --> 22:34.685
He's got my vote,
but enough for an arrest? No.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.420
The girl's an adult.

22:36.422 --> 22:38.489
Get her a legal aid lawyer.

22:38.491 --> 22:40.658
Scare the hell out of her.
She'll roll.

22:42.462 --> 22:44.362
Pick her up.

22:46.666 --> 22:49.066
(<i> knocking</i> )

22:49.068 --> 22:51.068
Are you here
to apologize
this time?

22:51.070 --> 22:53.003
Alicia Rivers,
you're under arrest

22:53.005 --> 22:54.839
for the murder
of Jose Urbano.
What?!

22:54.841 --> 22:57.141
You have the right
to remain silent and refuse

22:57.143 --> 22:59.076
to answer questions...
This is ridiculous.
This is wrong!

22:59.078 --> 23:02.012
Anything you do say
may be used against you
in a court of law.

23:02.014 --> 23:04.448
Do you understand?
You're entitled
to an attorney...

23:06.819 --> 23:08.719
The charges are murder
in the second degree

23:08.721 --> 23:12.757
and conspiracy
in the first degree.

23:12.759 --> 23:15.659
Are the defendants ready
to enter a plea?

23:15.661 --> 23:17.795
Not guilty.

23:17.797 --> 23:20.798
Your Honor, the district
attorney has outdone himself.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.400
We respectfully submit

23:22.402 --> 23:24.769
that the charges
are so inflated...

23:24.771 --> 23:26.404
I get the message, Ms. Greene.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.806
Do you want
to address the bail issues?

23:28.808 --> 23:30.007
They're simple.

23:30.009 --> 23:32.910
No record, no resources,
no risk of flight.

23:32.912 --> 23:36.680
Ms. Green. Thank you.
We don't get much alliteration,

23:36.682 --> 23:39.050
Mr. Robinette?

23:39.051 --> 23:41.419
Your Honor, the murder charged
here is particularly vicious.

23:41.421 --> 23:42.787
In addition, the defendant
has relatives

23:42.789 --> 23:44.922
in the Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico.

23:44.924 --> 23:47.658
And the risk of flight
is not negligible.

23:47.660 --> 23:50.895
The people request
substantial bail.

23:50.897 --> 23:52.830
Your Honor, you<i> know</i>
what bail means.

23:52.832 --> 23:55.699
It means Alicia Rivers stays in
jail because she is poor.

23:55.701 --> 23:56.867
If you don't see...

23:56.869 --> 23:59.337
Please, Ms. Green,

23:59.338 --> 24:01.806
Society dinner speech.
I have heard your Legal Aid

24:01.808 --> 24:03.507
I'm sympathetic.

24:03.509 --> 24:06.944
in a homicide? I'm sorry.
But one's own recognizance

24:06.946 --> 24:10.781
Bail is set for the defendant
at $100,000.

24:10.783 --> 24:14.084
A three-legged table
would stand up better
in court than your case.

24:14.086 --> 24:16.854
Not to mention the fact that if
she lived on Park Avenue

24:16.856 --> 24:18.272
you wouldn't
have filed.

24:18.273 --> 24:19.689
Wait a minute.
What do minorities
complain about?

24:19.692 --> 24:21.592
They kill whites,
they get prosecuted.

24:21.594 --> 24:24.462
They kill each other,
the system doesn't care.

24:24.464 --> 24:25.563
I never realized

24:25.565 --> 24:27.097
that passions
about minorities

24:27.099 --> 24:28.899
ran so high
in this office.

24:28.901 --> 24:30.868
Next time you
care so much

24:30.870 --> 24:32.736
pick a case you can win.

24:32.738 --> 24:35.840
We always care when we have
a criminal conspiracy.

24:35.842 --> 24:38.576
Who said that
when the links rattle

24:38.578 --> 24:40.511
they're probably in a chain?

24:40.513 --> 24:43.848
Ah! The light dawns.

24:43.850 --> 24:46.016
You're after the boy.

24:46.018 --> 24:48.819
You're looking for a deal.

24:48.821 --> 24:50.821
You put a young girl

24:50.823 --> 24:52.857
through the indignity of
jail for no other reason

24:52.859 --> 24:54.859
but to force her to talk?

24:54.861 --> 24:57.995
If she's protecting
somebody, it is not in
her interest to refuse.

24:57.997 --> 25:00.865
How could I refuse
when you didn't offer?

25:00.867 --> 25:02.132
But don't bother.

25:02.134 --> 25:04.001
The way I read the penal law

25:04.003 --> 25:05.135
conspiracy means

25:05.137 --> 25:07.872
people have to agree
to commit a crime.

25:07.874 --> 25:10.241
You can't prove

25:10.242 --> 25:12.609
that Nicky and Alicia
agreed on the time of day.

25:12.612 --> 25:14.979
This case is about revenge.
and the last time I looked,

25:14.981 --> 25:16.747
that is not
a valid criminal defense.

25:16.749 --> 25:18.616
We have evidence that will prove

25:18.618 --> 25:21.619
that your client conspired
to commit murder.

25:21.621 --> 25:22.820
Really?

25:22.822 --> 25:25.890
You have so much evidence,
you're accusing her

25:25.892 --> 25:29.760
of conspiring with someone
who isn't even charged.

25:29.762 --> 25:31.762
Want some advice
on this one gentlemen?

25:31.764 --> 25:32.897
Cut your losses.

25:32.899 --> 25:35.933
You're going to end up
feasting on crow.

25:35.935 --> 25:37.902
Ms. Green has a point.

25:37.904 --> 25:39.036
No, Alicia walked him out.

25:39.038 --> 25:40.137
The grandmother's gun
killed Urbano.

25:40.139 --> 25:43.140
If I had to win on conspiracy,
I would

25:43.142 --> 25:45.543
but I want the Guzman kid for
murder.

25:45.545 --> 25:47.611
You moved on the girl too soon.

25:47.613 --> 25:48.879
Would<i> you</i> like to ramrod
this case?

25:48.881 --> 25:51.916
Your ability to forget
people's skin color

25:51.918 --> 25:53.968
is admirable.

25:53.969 --> 25:56.019
Unfortunately, if we lose,
white people think

25:56.022 --> 25:58.923
that Puerto Ricans
get away with murder

25:58.925 --> 26:01.559
and if you don't
get the Guzman boy

26:01.561 --> 26:03.928
it looks like
selective prosecution.

26:03.930 --> 26:05.496
And if we drop it

26:05.497 --> 26:07.063
we have a clear-cut case
of revenge

26:07.066 --> 26:08.966
and there's
daily obstruction.

26:08.968 --> 26:11.735
The girl raped,
her sister on trial.

26:11.737 --> 26:13.203
Shambala Green with a jury.

26:13.205 --> 26:15.205
She'll milk them
till they moo.

26:15.207 --> 26:16.807
You see a winner?

26:16.809 --> 26:20.778
The girl's tied to the victim
and the gun.

26:20.780 --> 26:22.913
If Judge Markham
doesn't dismiss.

26:22.915 --> 26:25.149
The whole thing
is circumstantial.

26:25.151 --> 26:27.151
The girl works for a priest,
no less.

26:27.153 --> 26:30.054
To a jury, she's practically
got a halo.

26:30.056 --> 26:32.022
Do you have any<i> helpful</i>
suggestions?

26:34.160 --> 26:35.859
Get the priest to talk.

26:35.861 --> 26:37.995
And try the grandmother, too.

26:37.997 --> 26:39.129
Thank you.

26:39.131 --> 26:41.832
Cops-- a lot
of good they do us

26:41.834 --> 26:43.667
in this neighborhood.

26:43.669 --> 26:46.670
Is that why
you didn't call them

26:46.672 --> 26:48.939
when your gun
was stolen?

26:48.941 --> 26:54.044
Your gun, your granddaughter,
and no report of a break-in.

26:54.046 --> 26:55.946
Ms. Rivers,

26:55.948 --> 26:59.817
do you know what
women's prisons are like?

26:59.819 --> 27:01.719
It's not
going to happen.

27:01.721 --> 27:03.020
Everybody says so.

27:03.022 --> 27:03.988
Everybody?

27:03.990 --> 27:05.823
You mean Father Torres?

27:05.825 --> 27:07.925
I talked to Shambala,
the lawyer.

27:07.927 --> 27:08.926
Ms. Green

27:08.928 --> 27:10.694
is a legal aid lawyer.

27:10.696 --> 27:13.097
Legal aid loses two-thirds
of its cases.

27:13.099 --> 27:16.967
The district attorney
<i>wins</i> two-thirds.

27:16.969 --> 27:19.103
Do you want to gamble
with Ms. Green?

27:19.105 --> 27:22.806
Your granddaughter, Lucy,
is in the hospital.

27:22.808 --> 27:24.074
Alicia is in jail.

27:24.076 --> 27:27.945
Witnesses will place Alicia
with the victim.

27:27.947 --> 27:32.216
Ballistics experts will testify
your gun was used.

27:32.218 --> 27:35.085
A nurse will testify
she heard

27:35.087 --> 27:37.921
Father Torres
warning Alicia and Nicky.

27:37.923 --> 27:41.191
15 or 20 years from now,
when Alicia gets out of jail

27:41.193 --> 27:43.961
I hope Father Torres
and Ms. Green

27:43.963 --> 27:45.129
are waiting for her.

27:45.131 --> 27:47.865
Look, you're trying
to push me around.

27:47.867 --> 27:52.903
No. I'm trying to help you,
<i> and</i> your granddaughter.

27:52.905 --> 27:57.041
And she doesn't go to prison?

27:57.043 --> 27:58.308
I can't promise that.

27:58.310 --> 28:02.112
But if there is any time,
it will be minimal.

28:06.318 --> 28:08.052
Time for
the truth

28:08.054 --> 28:09.186
to come out.

28:09.188 --> 28:12.256
You got a car?

28:12.258 --> 28:16.794
GREEN:
<i>Anna, you have to listen to me.</i>

28:16.796 --> 28:18.228
I told you about this.

28:18.230 --> 28:20.964
They will try
any trick in the book.

28:20.966 --> 28:23.000
This is<i> my</i> trick.

28:23.002 --> 28:26.870
GUARD:
Green for
Alicia Rivers.

28:30.910 --> 28:32.209
Alicia, how are you?

28:32.211 --> 28:33.611
I'm all right.

28:33.612 --> 28:35.012
Your grandmother wants
me to tell them.

28:35.014 --> 28:35.979
Shut up, you!

28:35.981 --> 28:37.548
What is this?

28:37.549 --> 28:39.116
Grandma, no!
(<i> indistinct shouting</i> )

28:39.118 --> 28:41.218
NICKY:
Alicia, you want me to tell?

28:41.220 --> 28:45.322
Are you going
to let her die in jail?

28:46.726 --> 28:48.726
Urbano raped Lucy.

28:48.728 --> 28:49.993
Nicky killed him.

28:49.995 --> 28:54.264
BAILIFF:
<i> in the second degree.</i>

28:54.266 --> 28:57.868
Your Honor,
may we approach?

29:03.042 --> 29:04.942
Now what's the problem?

29:04.944 --> 29:06.777
We haven't even gotten
to bail yet.

29:06.779 --> 29:08.045
Ms. Green represents
the defendant

29:08.047 --> 29:11.014
to be tried jointly
with Mr. Guzman.

29:11.016 --> 29:12.583
Clear conflict
of interest.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.151
Hmm, now I get why
this was assigned to me.

29:14.153 --> 29:17.087
It's the same case as the girl.
Yes, it is,
Your Honor,

29:17.089 --> 29:18.188
but I don't
see any conflict...

29:18.190 --> 29:19.690
Please.

29:19.691 --> 29:21.191
Ms. Green, of course there's
conflict.

29:21.193 --> 29:25.329
If he wants to roll the girl
against Mr. Guzman here

29:25.331 --> 29:27.898
you can't defend both of them.

29:27.900 --> 29:32.002
My clerk read
the grand jury minutes.

29:32.004 --> 29:34.171
I was going
to do the girl's trial

29:34.173 --> 29:37.274
but I was considering
dismissal<i> sua sponte.</i>

29:37.276 --> 29:40.010
We feel there's a case.

29:40.012 --> 29:41.662
It's a judgment call,
Mr. Robinette.

29:41.663 --> 29:43.313
If you want to go back
to the grand jury

29:43.315 --> 29:46.350
and get better evidence,
I'll let you re-present.

29:46.352 --> 29:49.052
In the interest of justice,
I'm dismissing on the girl.

29:49.054 --> 29:51.021
I'll let her represent the boy.

29:51.023 --> 29:54.091
Now, let's see
if we can get some bail here.

29:54.093 --> 29:55.959
About bail,
Your Honor...

29:55.961 --> 29:57.478
Please,

29:57.479 --> 29:58.996
Ms. Green, spare me
your usual sanctimonies.

29:58.998 --> 30:01.131
I'm not in the mood. Okay?

30:10.042 --> 30:12.910
to enter a plea?
Uh, now, does the defendant wish

30:12.912 --> 30:15.813
Not guilty,
Your Honor.

30:15.815 --> 30:17.414
Bail $200,000.

30:17.416 --> 30:19.983
Short date.

30:19.985 --> 30:22.419
I'm going
for temporary insanity.

30:22.421 --> 30:24.288
Yours or your client's?

30:24.290 --> 30:26.290
Murder two.

30:26.292 --> 30:29.059
He was not going
to kill the guy.

30:29.061 --> 30:30.427
He just wanted
to talk.

30:30.429 --> 30:31.929
Seven shots from a
semiautomatic?

30:31.931 --> 30:33.397
What language is that?

30:33.399 --> 30:35.299
I'll interpret for the jury.
He was enraged.

30:35.301 --> 30:37.835
He didn't know what
the hell he was doing.

30:37.837 --> 30:39.203
The sister was in the hospital
on Wednesday.

30:39.205 --> 30:41.138
The shooting happened
on Saturday.

30:41.140 --> 30:43.140
He was insane
for three whole days?

30:43.142 --> 30:47.077
In a moment of normal,
excusable, and acceptable rage

30:47.079 --> 30:49.046
after his fiance was raped.

30:49.048 --> 30:52.316
This is a nice-looking kid,
very appealing.

30:52.318 --> 30:55.419
I believe the jury
will identify with him

30:55.421 --> 30:58.055
and the press
will crucify you.

30:58.057 --> 31:00.958
Let's discuss
reckless endangerment.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.993
Oh, please.

31:02.994 --> 31:05.027
He endangered a man's life
with seven shots?

31:05.030 --> 31:08.432
My dictionary calls that
more than endangering.

31:08.434 --> 31:10.000
Manslaughter one.

31:10.002 --> 31:12.186
He does three years.

31:12.187 --> 31:14.371
Manslaughter two--
he does a year on the farm.
He sees a shrink.

31:14.373 --> 31:17.341
No deal.
You're really gonna
push this, aren't you?

31:17.343 --> 31:18.442
All the way.

31:18.444 --> 31:20.177
This is a good kid!

31:20.179 --> 31:21.979
A role model for minority youth.

31:21.981 --> 31:24.147
You got a problem,
put seven shots into him.

31:24.149 --> 31:26.183
A drug dealer and a rapist?

31:26.185 --> 31:28.118
What are you
telling me?

31:28.120 --> 31:31.154
The proper compensation
for a human life is one year?

31:31.156 --> 31:33.073
What's next?

31:33.074 --> 31:34.991
A retarded petty thief--
you do a year and a half.

31:34.994 --> 31:36.159
Unarmed burglar-- two years.

31:36.161 --> 31:38.128
A white, Anglo-Saxon
Protestant-- 25 to life.

31:38.130 --> 31:41.031
The commandment says
"thou shalt not kill."

31:41.033 --> 31:42.099
It does not say

31:42.101 --> 31:44.134
"thou shalt not
kill nice people."

31:44.136 --> 31:47.004
The boy's girlfriend raped,
beaten to a pulp.

31:47.006 --> 31:51.141
You won't find 12 people
who will convict him

31:51.143 --> 31:53.543
of criminal
possession of a weapon.

31:53.545 --> 31:56.113
Fine, you take the plea
and the press conference, too.

31:56.115 --> 31:59.016
You got a suit of armor and a
white charger waiting outside?

31:59.018 --> 32:00.550
The boy is not
a cold-blooded killer.

32:00.552 --> 32:02.286
That's fine,
but where does it stop?

32:02.288 --> 32:04.288
Do we write a revenge exception
in the penal law?

32:04.290 --> 32:06.156
Now listen,
why don't you...?
First Green, now you.

32:06.158 --> 32:08.158
I must be way behind the
curve of judicial thinking.

32:08.160 --> 32:10.093
I'm not saying
let him go.

32:10.095 --> 32:11.094
Plead him.

32:11.096 --> 32:13.230
Have him do
a couple of years.

32:13.232 --> 32:16.233
And let's get it
off our plate.

32:22.174 --> 32:23.140
We take a plea.

32:23.142 --> 32:24.274
It's an order.

32:24.276 --> 32:25.275
Forget it.
What?

32:25.277 --> 32:27.277
I was just coming
to tell you.

32:27.279 --> 32:30.347
We're getting visitors
from another planet.

32:30.349 --> 32:31.581
Green resigned.
There's a new counsel.

32:31.583 --> 32:33.483
Resigned? In favor of who?

32:33.485 --> 32:35.953
A showboat from Dallas--
Chet Burton.

32:35.955 --> 32:37.587
Flew in this morning.
He's taking it, no fee.

32:37.589 --> 32:39.189
And, yes, I checked--

32:39.191 --> 32:41.291
he's admitted
to the New York Bar.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.026
You're a fine lawyer, Mr. Stone.

32:43.028 --> 32:45.128
I've heard
a whole lot about you.

32:45.130 --> 32:47.130
Thanks, sir. I've read
a great deal about you.

32:47.132 --> 32:50.033
I'm afraid you severely
misunderstand this case.

32:50.035 --> 32:51.201
How so?

32:51.203 --> 32:53.036
According to his culture

32:53.038 --> 32:55.138
Nicky Guzman
did the right thing.

32:55.140 --> 32:58.141
See, most first-generation
immigrant neighborhoods

32:58.143 --> 33:01.211
somebody rapes your woman,
you go get a gun.

33:01.213 --> 33:05.215
Up here in New York,
you go get a warrant for arrest.

33:05.217 --> 33:08.318
I'd like to remind you
that we have a witness

33:08.320 --> 33:11.021
who heard the boy
plan the murder.

33:11.023 --> 33:12.622
My motion, Mr. Stone.

33:12.624 --> 33:16.460
Start with<i> People v. Gates,</i>
New York Court of Appeals

33:16.462 --> 33:18.595
on priest-penitent
privilege.

33:18.597 --> 33:20.464
I don't think Father Torres

33:20.466 --> 33:23.133
will ever spend any time
on the witness stand.

33:23.135 --> 33:24.201
You know

33:24.203 --> 33:26.636
my whole life
as a lawyer--

33:26.638 --> 33:29.339
27 years in court--

33:29.341 --> 33:32.542
you know how many
criminal cases I've lost?

33:34.113 --> 33:37.247
Zero. Zip. Not a one.

33:37.249 --> 33:39.216
Oh, really?

33:41.053 --> 33:44.154
Well, this is not Texas, sir.

33:44.156 --> 33:47.357
If I were you,
I wouldn't be too sure of that.

33:51.563 --> 33:54.064
BURTON:
Howdy, Mr. Stone.

33:54.066 --> 33:57.567
A new day, a new voice--
what will tomorrow bring?

33:57.569 --> 34:00.103
Oh, I get up some mornings
I just naturally hear

34:00.105 --> 34:02.039
my pappy's twang in my head.

34:02.041 --> 34:03.573
What are you dressed
for, a rodeo?

34:03.575 --> 34:04.574
Yup.

34:04.576 --> 34:06.109
Legal bull riding.

34:06.111 --> 34:07.811
Excuse me,
one question.

34:07.813 --> 34:10.147
Shoot.
How did you find
out about this case?

34:10.149 --> 34:13.050
It was only on page
seven in the New York papers.

34:13.052 --> 34:14.618
I hadn't heard a word about it

34:14.620 --> 34:17.354
until Nicky's lawyer
called me-- a Ms. Green.

34:17.356 --> 34:18.455
Oh, I see.

34:18.457 --> 34:21.792
Said you needed
to be taught a lesson.

34:21.794 --> 34:24.061
What's in it for you?

34:24.063 --> 34:26.463
Well, I have saved
many rich folks

34:26.465 --> 34:28.065
from unjust incarceration.

34:28.067 --> 34:30.067
As much as I'm able

34:30.069 --> 34:34.571
I plan to give the poor
the same consideration.

34:34.573 --> 34:37.207
STONE:
Mrs. Rivers, you told police

34:37.209 --> 34:40.444
that your gun was stolen
in a burglary.

34:40.446 --> 34:41.545
Is that true?

34:41.547 --> 34:43.447
No.

34:43.449 --> 34:47.684
When did you first notice
the gun was missing?

34:47.686 --> 34:49.486
On Saturday night.

34:49.488 --> 34:51.721
The night Mr. Urbano was killed.

34:51.723 --> 34:53.590
Yes.

34:53.592 --> 34:56.560
Was Nicky Guzman
at your club that night?

35:00.699 --> 35:02.632
Yes.

35:02.634 --> 35:06.103
Had you ever shown him
where you kept your gun?

35:06.105 --> 35:08.572
He knew it was
in the cash drawer

35:08.574 --> 35:10.240
under the register.

35:10.242 --> 35:11.508
Thank you.

35:11.510 --> 35:13.610
No further questions.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.745
Nicky said he wanted
to fight Urbano,

35:15.747 --> 35:17.514
to teach him a lesson.

35:17.516 --> 35:20.117
Did he show you the gun
he was carrying?

35:20.119 --> 35:21.251
Yes.

35:21.253 --> 35:23.687
But he said
he only wanted a fist fight.

35:23.689 --> 35:24.688
Objection.

35:24.690 --> 35:26.156
Asked and answered.

35:26.158 --> 35:27.224
Sustained.

35:27.226 --> 35:28.859
Your witness.

35:35.267 --> 35:40.270
Miss Rivers, on the morning
after Mr. Urbano was shot

35:40.272 --> 35:43.773
did you go to church
with Nicky Guzman?

35:43.775 --> 35:45.575
Yes.

35:45.577 --> 35:48.678
And did Mr. Guzman
take confession that morning?

35:48.680 --> 35:50.147
Yes.

35:50.149 --> 35:52.883
Now about this cocaine dealer
who was shot...

35:52.885 --> 35:53.884
Objection.

35:53.886 --> 35:55.552
Characterization.

35:55.554 --> 35:56.553
Sustained.

35:56.555 --> 35:58.188
Miss Rivers,

35:58.189 --> 35:59.822
did you have
a personal relationship

35:59.825 --> 36:00.824
with Jose Urbano?

36:00.826 --> 36:01.925
Objection.
Relevance.

36:01.927 --> 36:03.760
Overruled.

36:03.761 --> 36:05.594
I'll let it go, Mr. Burton,
but watch your step.

36:05.597 --> 36:07.564
The witness will answer.

36:07.566 --> 36:09.533
Jose tried to sell me crack.

36:09.535 --> 36:10.534
Objection.

36:10.536 --> 36:12.536
The victim is not on trial here.

36:12.538 --> 36:13.637
Sustained.

36:13.639 --> 36:15.572
The jury
will disregard the answer.

36:15.574 --> 36:17.841
Mr. Burton, you will
confine yourself to events.

36:17.843 --> 36:20.544
Miss Rivers, were you aware

36:20.546 --> 36:25.715
that Jose Urbano was known
to carry a gun at all times?

36:25.717 --> 36:26.917
STONE:
Your Honor?

36:26.919 --> 36:29.886
You are straining my good will,
Mr. Burton.

36:29.888 --> 36:34.591
Since I cannot ask any questions
about the sainted Señor Urbano

36:34.593 --> 36:37.861
I have no further questions
of this witness.

36:37.863 --> 36:39.496
Manslaughter two.

36:39.498 --> 36:43.533
In this state, Mr. Stone,
what can you get for that?

36:43.535 --> 36:46.937
Mr. Guzman does two years.

36:46.939 --> 36:48.738
He doesn't do two seconds.

36:48.740 --> 36:50.807
Criminally negligent homicide.

36:50.809 --> 36:54.611
And you put him in a program
where he gets his head candled.

36:54.613 --> 36:57.681
It was an accident. The gun went
off by itself seven times?

36:57.683 --> 36:59.282
You know what a "bubba" is?

36:59.284 --> 37:01.818
Up here, you call them
"rednecks."

37:01.820 --> 37:03.620
Where I come from

37:03.622 --> 37:06.356
all the men got shotguns
in their pickups

37:06.358 --> 37:08.892
and a can of beer in their hand.

37:08.894 --> 37:13.363
My shotgun stays in the house,
and I drink California cabernet

37:13.365 --> 37:15.865
but in my heart,
I'm still a bubba.

37:15.867 --> 37:20.237
That's why there's no plea
unless the boy does no time.

37:20.239 --> 37:23.773
The "boy" put seven holes
in somebody.

37:23.775 --> 37:24.774
Somebody.

37:24.776 --> 37:26.810
Drug-dealing rapist scum.

37:26.812 --> 37:30.714
Most towns in Texas,
the kid would get a medal.

37:30.716 --> 37:35.552
You may not like my style,
Mr. Stone, but this I believe--

37:35.554 --> 37:40.657
you don't put people in prison
for defending their loved ones.

37:40.659 --> 37:42.726
Defending or avenging?

37:42.728 --> 37:46.730
I'll let the jury
split that hair.

37:49.901 --> 37:52.302
You're due in chambers at 2:00.

37:52.304 --> 37:54.904
Markham wants to talk
about the priest.

37:54.906 --> 37:57.574
BURTON:
<i> You can't allow it!</i>

37:57.576 --> 37:58.942
<i> If he testifies,</i>

37:58.944 --> 38:00.877
you destroy the sanctity

38:00.879 --> 38:02.045
of the priest/penitent
relationship.

38:02.047 --> 38:04.681
If he's not acting
as his spiritual advisor,

38:04.683 --> 38:06.683
if it's not confession
there's no privilege.

38:06.685 --> 38:09.586
For God's sake, he was at the
hospital as a priest.

38:09.588 --> 38:11.655
Did he wear a collar? Yes.

38:11.657 --> 38:13.690
Did he minister
to his flock? Yes.

38:13.692 --> 38:16.760
Unfortunately,
Alicia Rivers called the priest,

38:16.762 --> 38:18.862
not your client.

38:18.863 --> 38:20.963
Personally, I have
a very hard time believing

38:20.966 --> 38:23.767
that he fell to his knees
in the I.C.U.

38:23.769 --> 38:26.369
and mistook it
for a confessional.

38:27.839 --> 38:29.939
I have made a decision.

38:29.941 --> 38:31.808
Torres will testify.

38:31.810 --> 38:33.843
And while I'm about it

38:33.845 --> 38:39.649
it will do you good to remember
this is New York, not Texas.

38:39.651 --> 38:43.086
Permission to treat this witness
as hostile, Your Honor.

38:43.088 --> 38:44.688
Granted.

38:44.690 --> 38:47.757
Did Lucy Rivers tell you
that she had been raped?

38:47.759 --> 38:49.392
Counselor?

38:49.394 --> 38:52.862
I have no problem
with the question, Your Honor.

38:52.864 --> 38:55.832
Yes, she told me
she had been raped.

38:55.834 --> 38:58.668
Did she tell you
she had been raped

38:58.670 --> 39:00.003
by Jose Urbano?

39:00.005 --> 39:01.705
Yes.

39:01.707 --> 39:03.740
And did the defendant tell you

39:03.742 --> 39:05.975
that he was planning
on killing Jose Urbano

39:05.977 --> 39:07.877
because he had raped Lucy
Rivers?

39:07.879 --> 39:10.046
He said he was going
to get a gun.

39:10.048 --> 39:12.682
When you left the hospital
with Nicky that night,

39:12.684 --> 39:14.784
what did he do on the way out?

39:14.786 --> 39:18.021
He put his fist
through a plate glass window--

39:18.023 --> 39:19.356
a phone booth.

39:19.358 --> 39:21.057
But he was very angry.

39:21.059 --> 39:24.027
Thank you. No further questions,
Your Honor.

39:28.767 --> 39:30.767
Father Torres,

39:30.769 --> 39:34.037
please tell the court
about your relationship

39:34.039 --> 39:36.873
with Nicky Guzman
and Lucy Rivers.

39:36.875 --> 39:39.142
They're engaged
to be married,

39:39.144 --> 39:41.878
and they're in my counseling
class for new couples.

39:41.880 --> 39:46.683
Now, in your experience
with members of your parish

39:46.685 --> 39:49.753
how serious is
the crime of rape?

39:49.755 --> 39:52.722
There's a sense of...

39:52.724 --> 39:54.758
terrible shame.

39:54.760 --> 39:59.429
It's like, you're a lawyer
and your son is a thief.

39:59.431 --> 40:04.501
The woman is shamed,
the husband is shamed,

40:04.503 --> 40:06.503
the whole family.

40:06.505 --> 40:09.739
In a way, they've taken more
than her own life.

40:13.812 --> 40:15.545
Let's get back to the window.

40:15.547 --> 40:19.182
You ever put your fist
through a plate glass window?

40:19.184 --> 40:21.050
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance.

40:21.052 --> 40:22.519
We're talking about
plate glass windows.

40:22.521 --> 40:24.821
I'd like to know a little more
on the subject.

40:24.823 --> 40:25.822
I'll allow it.

40:25.824 --> 40:27.724
You may answer the question.

40:27.726 --> 40:30.560
When I was in the Marines,
before I became a priest,

40:30.562 --> 40:32.128
I got drunk on leave

40:32.130 --> 40:34.998
and I busted
a couple of windows, yes.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.166
Ever kill anybody?

40:36.168 --> 40:37.767
Your Honor?
Mr. Burton...

40:37.769 --> 40:39.436
No, I haven't.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.104
You think most people
that break plate glass windows

40:41.106 --> 40:42.205
end up killing someone, Father?

40:42.207 --> 40:43.807
Objection.

40:43.809 --> 40:45.425
Sustained.
Mr. Burton,

40:45.426 --> 40:47.042
you will not ask for conclusions
in this court room.

40:47.045 --> 40:49.879
The jury will disregard
that last remark.

40:49.881 --> 40:53.817
And you will play by the rules
here, or you'll be in trouble.

40:55.787 --> 40:57.987
The gun was on the ground,
not near his hand?

40:57.989 --> 40:59.489
That's correct.

40:59.491 --> 41:01.224
It was directly
under his waist.

41:01.226 --> 41:02.592
It probably fell...

41:02.594 --> 41:04.027
Objection.

41:04.028 --> 41:05.461
The detective is supposin'
and concludin'.

41:05.464 --> 41:06.463
Sustained.

41:06.465 --> 41:07.764
Had the gun

41:07.766 --> 41:08.531
been fired?

41:08.533 --> 41:09.532
No.

41:09.534 --> 41:11.568
Was there
any evidence

41:11.570 --> 41:13.903
that the victim
attempted to fire the gun?

41:13.905 --> 41:16.139
None.

41:16.141 --> 41:17.607
Your witness.

41:22.013 --> 41:23.847
This gun, Detective--

41:23.849 --> 41:27.150
were Mr. Urbano's
fingerprints on it?

41:27.152 --> 41:28.518
It was<i> his</i> gun, so...

41:28.520 --> 41:30.620
Any other prints on it?

41:30.622 --> 41:32.021
No.

41:32.023 --> 41:34.958
So this gun was not
in his pants.

41:34.960 --> 41:36.593
It was out.
Is that correct?

41:36.595 --> 41:38.895
Yes.

41:38.896 --> 41:41.196
So Mr. Urbano could have drawn
his weapon and been shot

41:41.199 --> 41:43.533
by somebody defending himself,
isn't that possible?

41:43.535 --> 41:44.934
Objection.

41:44.936 --> 41:46.035
That's ridiculous.

41:46.037 --> 41:47.036
Sustained.

41:47.038 --> 41:48.872
But isn't it
possible?

41:48.874 --> 41:49.873
Mr. Burton!

41:49.875 --> 41:51.541
Excuse me,
Your Honor.

41:51.543 --> 41:54.143
No more questions.

41:54.145 --> 41:57.013
ROBINETTE:
<i> Seed of doubt.</i>

41:57.015 --> 41:58.882
Sounds like
self-defense.

41:58.884 --> 42:00.617
Mr. Stone, the Spanish loverboy
shooting,

42:00.619 --> 42:01.918
detective
named Greevey called.

42:01.920 --> 42:04.020
He wants to see you
at Rikers.

42:04.022 --> 42:05.588
GREEVEY:
<i> Nuñez, Ramon, 21.</i>

42:05.590 --> 42:08.925
Picked up
in a sweep.

42:08.927 --> 42:11.661
College student
and a crack addict.

42:11.663 --> 42:13.062
D.A. to see Nuñez.

42:13.064 --> 42:16.199
Had crack on him
when they picked him up.

42:16.201 --> 42:18.635
Asked to see
a homicide detective.

42:18.637 --> 42:21.638
DEFENDER:
No information
without a deal.

42:21.640 --> 42:24.541
I have to get out of this.
I have a conviction.

42:24.543 --> 42:26.576
I'll lose my scholarship.

42:26.578 --> 42:31.581
If he has something we can use,
criminal possession five.

42:31.583 --> 42:32.949
Six. I want a misdemeanor.

42:32.951 --> 42:34.851
Depends on what
he has to say.

42:34.853 --> 42:38.154
Nicky Guzman sold me crack.

42:38.156 --> 42:40.557
Nicky's a dealer?

42:40.559 --> 42:43.226
I haven't seen him
for four, five months

42:43.228 --> 42:44.694
but I bought from him

42:44.696 --> 42:47.130
all the time
last spring.

42:47.132 --> 42:48.665
Urbano's his supplier.

42:48.667 --> 42:51.000
He came with him
to school one day.

42:51.002 --> 42:53.036
We have a deal, Stone?

42:54.639 --> 42:56.639
Yeah.

42:56.641 --> 43:00.877
<i> Urbano and Nicky</i>
<i> being drug dealers</i>

43:00.879 --> 43:01.978
explains everything.

43:01.980 --> 43:03.112
Bull!

43:03.114 --> 43:05.949
Nicky hadn't seen Urbano
in four months.

43:05.951 --> 43:08.985
He stopped having
anything to do with drugs

43:08.987 --> 43:10.587
when he got engaged.
Now, Your Honor,

43:10.589 --> 43:13.623
even arguing that this
was intentional murder--

43:13.625 --> 43:15.224
and I'm not
saying it was--

43:15.226 --> 43:16.659
it's about revenge.

43:16.661 --> 43:18.661
Call that boy a drug dealer

43:18.663 --> 43:21.030
they'll convict him
on that alone.

43:21.032 --> 43:22.599
Doesn't prove anything, Ben.

43:22.601 --> 43:24.233
Even I find it prejudicial.

43:24.235 --> 43:25.335
I don't see why.

43:25.337 --> 43:27.270
It's relevant as to motive.

43:27.272 --> 43:29.005
<i> People v. Malino.</i>
Urbano raped Lucy Rivers

43:29.007 --> 43:32.008
because her boyfriend
quit working for him.

43:32.010 --> 43:33.242
This is ridiculous.

43:33.244 --> 43:34.611
It's like pimps with
their prostitutes.

43:34.613 --> 43:36.045
It's not a job
they allow

43:36.047 --> 43:38.147
the street dealers
to walk away from.

43:38.149 --> 43:40.316
Drug dealing is the underlying
cause of this murder.

43:40.318 --> 43:41.951
That's your opinion, Ben.

43:41.953 --> 43:44.020
The defendant
has no record

43:44.022 --> 43:45.154
of drug offense.

43:45.156 --> 43:47.290
Plus,<i> your</i> witness is suspect.

43:47.292 --> 43:48.958
You made a deal
for his testimony.

43:48.960 --> 43:50.360
Let the jury decide.

43:50.362 --> 43:52.729
Allow the testimony,
then instruct them to disregard?

43:52.731 --> 43:54.330
Now you know as well as I do...

43:54.332 --> 43:56.733
Put some ice on it, Mr. Burton.

43:56.735 --> 43:58.167
I don't like you.

43:58.169 --> 44:01.638
I don't like your theatrics
in my courtroom.

44:01.640 --> 44:03.673
I may be
old-fashioned,

44:03.675 --> 44:05.008
but I find them

44:05.010 --> 44:08.411
undignified and maybe unethical.

44:08.413 --> 44:10.313
Remember the Watson murder?

44:10.315 --> 44:11.681
Killed his wife?

44:12.651 --> 44:14.651
I let some D.A. sweet-talk me

44:14.653 --> 44:17.353
into allowing
some improper testimony.

44:17.355 --> 44:19.422
The court of appeals
reversed it

44:19.424 --> 44:22.325
and Mr. Watson
is walking the streets.

44:22.327 --> 44:25.662
Now, if I allow this
and your boy gets convicted

44:25.664 --> 44:28.364
Mr. Burton here will be
in appellate court

44:28.366 --> 44:30.199
before I hit the bed.

44:32.037 --> 44:33.970
Ben, Burton's
junked his list.

44:33.972 --> 44:35.038
His only witness

44:35.040 --> 44:37.173
is the dealer
who was with Urbano

44:37.175 --> 44:38.975
just before he was killed.

44:38.977 --> 44:39.976
Cartagena?

44:39.978 --> 44:41.344
He wasn't even there.

44:41.346 --> 44:42.345
I know.

44:42.347 --> 44:44.347
Now, you told police

44:44.349 --> 44:48.251
you left the church
before the shooting.

44:48.253 --> 44:49.786
Why did you lie?

44:49.788 --> 44:52.606
I had to.

44:52.607 --> 44:55.425
You know, being on parole,
being with a guy like Jose,

44:55.427 --> 44:58.761
him being a dealer and all,
bad for me.

44:58.763 --> 45:03.066
When Mr. Urbano left
with the girl, did you follow?

45:03.068 --> 45:04.067
No.

45:04.069 --> 45:05.768
I told him not to go,

45:05.770 --> 45:08.237
but he put his hand
on his pistol

45:08.239 --> 45:11.741
and he said
he could take care of himself.

45:11.743 --> 45:15.712
Was Mr. Urbano a violent man?

45:15.714 --> 45:17.847
Objection.
Calls for a conclusion.

45:17.849 --> 45:19.082
Sustained.

45:19.084 --> 45:21.284
I'll rephrase.

45:21.286 --> 45:24.454
Did you ever personally see
Jose Urbano

45:24.456 --> 45:27.356
fire his gun at anybody?

45:27.358 --> 45:31.094
New Year's Eve, 1989.

45:31.096 --> 45:33.763
He shot a dealer.

45:33.765 --> 45:35.798
Jesus Costelo.

45:35.800 --> 45:37.867
Thank you.

45:45.343 --> 45:48.044
Three days.

45:48.045 --> 45:50.746
The verdict should have been in
yesterday at the latest.

45:50.749 --> 45:53.816
I hope you're not here
to say you warned me.

45:53.818 --> 45:56.052
You did
what you had to do.

45:56.054 --> 45:57.887
You wish I hadn't.

45:57.889 --> 46:00.356
The jury just asked
for the statutes

46:00.358 --> 46:02.525
on justification
for deadly force.

46:02.527 --> 46:04.260
Not gonna say it.

46:04.262 --> 46:05.828
What?

46:05.830 --> 46:08.765
He told me so.

46:08.767 --> 46:11.868
Has the jury reached a verdict?

46:12.837 --> 46:14.203
We have, Your Honor.

46:14.205 --> 46:16.539
On the sole count
of the indictment

46:16.541 --> 46:18.074
the charge of murder

46:18.076 --> 46:19.308
in the second degree,

46:19.310 --> 46:20.910
how does the jury find?

46:20.912 --> 46:23.312
Not guilty.

46:23.314 --> 46:24.847
(<i> gasps</i> )

46:32.791 --> 46:36.459
We felt he was a good kid,
putting himself through school.

46:36.461 --> 46:39.328
Uh... maybe he meant
to kill Urbano, but...

46:39.330 --> 46:42.799
How many times have you
given me the "you don't
win every time" speech?

46:42.801 --> 46:44.500
I don't mind losing, Paul.
Could've fooled me.

46:44.502 --> 46:47.203
What I do mind is
that 12 honest citizens

46:47.205 --> 46:49.806
knew he was guilty
and acquitted him.

46:49.808 --> 46:52.508
They were flimflammed
on the self-defense.

46:52.510 --> 46:54.544
They knew they were
being flimflammed

46:54.546 --> 46:56.579
and they still
acquitted him.

46:56.581 --> 46:56.612
And that's frightening.
