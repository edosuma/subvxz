WEBVTT

00:08.708 --> 00:10.791
-Autumn is here already.
-You're right.

00:16.250 --> 00:18.250
I smell meat.

00:20.958 --> 00:21.916
It's over there.

00:25.083 --> 00:26.916
-It's been a while.
-Yeah.

00:28.833 --> 00:30.500
I've been here once before.

00:30.583 --> 00:32.250
-For a shoot?
-Thank you.

00:35.250 --> 00:38.375
-Hello.
-My goodness! It's been five years.

00:43.541 --> 00:44.833
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:45.750 --> 00:47.250
-Hello.
-When'd you get here?

00:47.333 --> 00:48.458
Nice to meet you.

00:48.541 --> 00:49.625
-Loco!
-I'm Loco.

00:49.708 --> 00:51.041
-Nice to meet you.
-My friend.

00:51.125 --> 00:53.291
-I'm Jay Park.
-Hi, nice to meet you.

00:53.375 --> 00:55.291
-Haven't you met Jay?
-Nope.

00:55.375 --> 00:57.458
-This is the first time.
-Is that right?

00:57.541 --> 01:00.041
I thought you two had met already.

01:01.208 --> 01:02.333
Did you wait long?

01:02.416 --> 01:04.875
-Maybe five minutes?
-We got here five minutes ago.

01:04.958 --> 01:07.333
Are you Jay's age or older?

01:07.416 --> 01:09.541
I'm two years younger.

01:09.625 --> 01:11.041
Really? We're the same age.

01:12.250 --> 01:14.125
Is he your childhood friend?

01:14.208 --> 01:16.833
Since college. No. 2 at our company.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.333
How about you guys?

01:20.958 --> 01:22.875
He's the CEO, I'm one of his artists.

01:22.958 --> 01:23.916
-At his label?
-Yes.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.875
We also run a burger joint together.

01:25.958 --> 01:26.791
Really?

01:26.875 --> 01:29.000
I started it, and he joined the business.

01:29.083 --> 01:30.041
-You like food.
-Yes.

01:30.125 --> 01:30.958
FRIEND OF A FRIEND

01:31.041 --> 01:32.375
I've always liked burgers.

01:32.458 --> 01:33.458
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

01:33.541 --> 01:35.250
I must say,

01:35.333 --> 01:38.166
it feels weird to be sitting
with these famous people.

01:38.875 --> 01:41.125
-Not at all.
-We're just drinking buddies.

01:41.625 --> 01:42.916
DRINKING BUDDIES

01:43.000 --> 01:45.458
Excuse me. Can we get a bottle of soju?

01:45.541 --> 01:47.166
-Which soju?
-Chamisul, of course.

01:47.250 --> 01:49.833
-Sure.
-Fresh, right?

01:49.916 --> 01:51.666
Anything other than Mild and Fresh?

01:51.750 --> 01:54.083
-Give us the red one.
-Sure.

02:44.750 --> 02:48.000
SOJU

03:23.291 --> 03:27.583
SOJU

03:51.166 --> 03:52.208
Thank you.

03:52.291 --> 03:53.250
Is this one harder?

03:53.333 --> 03:54.500
Have you not had this?

03:54.583 --> 03:56.958
-I have.
-It has a higher alcohol content.

03:57.666 --> 04:00.166
I believe
Whole Foods in the US carries this.

04:00.250 --> 04:01.375
-Really?
-This version.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.416
-The classic one.
-Listen to him.

04:03.500 --> 04:05.666
-Whole Foods?
-Yes, Whole Foods.

04:05.750 --> 04:06.791
I see.

04:06.875 --> 04:08.750
I thought you were talking about golf.

04:08.833 --> 04:12.458
-Hold on. You first.
-Thank you.

04:12.541 --> 04:15.083
I should use both hands
since this is the first shot.

04:16.208 --> 04:17.125
How have you been?

04:18.291 --> 04:20.166
I've been good. Same old.

04:20.250 --> 04:21.500
It's been a while for us.

04:21.583 --> 04:22.666
-I know.
-Really?

04:23.333 --> 04:25.500
Especially
at a samgyeopsal place like this.

04:33.916 --> 04:36.208
-Cheers.
-Nice to meet you guys.

04:39.875 --> 04:40.708
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

04:40.791 --> 04:41.916
The first shot is key.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.666
Let's see if it's smooth.

04:43.750 --> 04:46.125
-Bon appétit.
-Bon appétit.

04:48.583 --> 04:50.166
We're getting drunk tonight.

04:52.458 --> 04:53.708
Do you guys get that too?

04:53.791 --> 04:55.041
-I do.
-You do?

04:55.125 --> 04:57.083
Yes, this is practically water right now.

04:57.166 --> 04:59.625
He had actually quit drinking.

04:59.708 --> 05:01.041
What? Why did you quit?

05:01.125 --> 05:03.541
-Do you get hangovers at all?
-Why do you ask?

05:03.625 --> 05:06.875
I get such bad hangovers.

05:06.958 --> 05:08.916
-So I haven't drank since July.
-I see.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.125
But Jay asked me to join today.

05:11.208 --> 05:14.500
-Bad drinking habits?
-I black out.

05:14.583 --> 05:15.666
Only my friends know.

05:15.750 --> 05:16.583
No memory?

05:16.666 --> 05:19.625
-His rap name is Loco, you see.
-Yeah.

05:19.708 --> 05:22.666
In Spanish, it means "crazy."

05:22.750 --> 05:24.458
-As in "El Pollo Loco"?
-That's it.

05:24.541 --> 05:26.375
-Crazy?
-Yup.

05:26.458 --> 05:28.291
-"El Pollo Loco" in LA.
-The one in LA.

05:28.375 --> 05:29.541
-That "Loco"?
-Yes.

05:29.625 --> 05:30.708
So he's a crazy dude.

05:32.083 --> 05:34.875
-So back when he used to drink a lot--
-Sorry.

05:34.958 --> 05:36.916
-We can talk casually, right?
-Yes.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.250
We're all buddies now.

05:38.333 --> 05:39.458
Yes, of course.

05:39.541 --> 05:41.291
-Drop the honorifics.
-Nah.

05:42.583 --> 05:45.291
Let's have another shot
before we grill the meat.

05:46.916 --> 05:49.083
-I'm drinking a lot today.
-Here, try this.

05:49.791 --> 05:51.625
It matters who you drink with.

05:51.708 --> 05:52.541
Yes, totally.

05:52.625 --> 05:54.875
More so than the food
you're pairing it with.

05:57.083 --> 05:58.500
Cheers, guys.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.250
Two shots on an empty stomach
means we'll get drunk fast.

06:09.708 --> 06:13.125
It tastes similar to the other ones.
It's my first time trying this.

06:13.208 --> 06:14.541
You know what's funny?

06:14.625 --> 06:17.375
The alcohol content used to be higher.

06:17.458 --> 06:20.250
But for this generation,
this is on the higher side.

06:20.333 --> 06:22.583
It's nothing compared
to how strong it used to be.

06:22.666 --> 06:24.791
Is this 19 or 21 percent?

06:24.875 --> 06:26.291
What is this? Let's check.

06:26.375 --> 06:28.500
Maybe 22? Or around 20?

06:29.250 --> 06:31.708
Drinking the red one makes you look tough.

06:33.583 --> 06:35.541
-You know what I mean?
-Yeah.

06:35.625 --> 06:39.333
In terms of taste,
all the different soju brands…

06:39.416 --> 06:40.416
They taste the same.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.666
In a way, they're like cocktail companies.

06:42.750 --> 06:45.000
-Cocktail?
-Yeah. What is a cocktail?

06:56.166 --> 06:58.625
COCKTAIL?

06:58.708 --> 06:59.791
What is a cocktail?

06:59.875 --> 07:02.041
-It's a mixed drink.
-Yeah.

07:02.125 --> 07:05.083
You mix alcohol with other ingredients
to make it taste good.

07:05.166 --> 07:07.083
-Right.
-Some are colorful, but anyway…

07:07.166 --> 07:09.166
Soju companies
are like cocktail companies.

07:09.250 --> 07:12.083
Jujeong is 95 percent alcohol.

07:12.166 --> 07:13.166
Edible alcohol.

07:13.250 --> 07:17.166
These soju companies receive this
from a government-selected manufacturer.

07:17.250 --> 07:19.416
They add water
to lower the alcohol content.

07:19.500 --> 07:23.166
Since it's 95 percent alcohol,
they'll need a lot of water.

07:23.250 --> 07:26.375
Since it's pure alcohol,
they also need some additives.

07:26.458 --> 07:29.375
They add sweeteners like aspartame.

07:29.458 --> 07:31.750
In other words,
they bring in 95% edible alcohol

07:31.833 --> 07:34.708
add water and sweeteners,
such as aspartame and oligosaccharides.

07:34.791 --> 07:36.041
JUJEONG, WATER, SWEETENER

07:36.125 --> 07:38.708
Each soju company has its unique recipe.

07:39.875 --> 07:41.416
Just like making cocktails.

07:41.500 --> 07:46.375
And is there a company
that makes the base alcohol?

07:46.458 --> 07:48.875
Correct. They turn that alcohol into this.

07:48.958 --> 07:50.500
Edible alcohol is…

07:50.583 --> 07:53.083
-You know bubble tea?
-Yeah.

07:53.166 --> 07:55.875
-Those chewy bubbles.
-Yeah.

07:55.958 --> 07:57.833
-They're made from starch.
-Tapioca.

07:57.916 --> 07:59.000
-Tapioca.
-Yes, tapioca.

07:59.083 --> 08:03.000
They make edible alcohol
using tapioca or potato starch.

08:24.666 --> 08:25.916
SPIRIT OF ALCOHOL

08:26.000 --> 08:27.250
JUJEONG

08:51.791 --> 08:56.708
TAPIOCA

09:37.750 --> 09:40.375
TAPIOCA, BARLEY, BROWN RICE, WHITE RICE

09:43.208 --> 09:45.750

10:49.041 --> 10:51.708
DISTRIBUTION

10:51.791 --> 10:53.791
KOREA ETHANOL SUPPLIES COMPANY

10:59.791 --> 11:06.791
CHAMISUL ORIGINAL

11:14.208 --> 11:17.666
That alcohol is sent
to Korea Ethanol Supplies Company.

11:17.750 --> 11:19.041
That company

11:19.125 --> 11:22.208
supplies all the soju companies
with the alcohol

11:22.291 --> 11:25.625
-and all you gotta do is add more water.
-Right.

11:25.708 --> 11:29.041
The one with the different color
is basically this plus more water.

11:29.125 --> 11:32.500
You get more alcohol for the same price.
We, entrepreneurs, gotta do that.

11:33.833 --> 11:37.875
Soju is the best-selling liquor
in the world.

11:37.958 --> 11:40.041
-The best-selling distilled liquor.
-Really?

11:40.125 --> 11:42.083
YEONTAE KAOLIANG

11:46.583 --> 11:47.666
CHAMISUL ORIGINAL

11:47.750 --> 11:52.125
WORLD-CLASS SOJU

11:52.208 --> 11:53.708
It wasn't too long ago

11:53.791 --> 11:57.583
that distilled spirits
were first introduced to Korea.

11:57.666 --> 11:59.500
-You know Andong soju, right?
-Yes.

11:59.583 --> 12:01.875
-Do you know why it's famous?
-No idea.

12:01.958 --> 12:04.583
One of the theories is that
centuries ago, the Mongol Empire

12:04.666 --> 12:06.833
invaded us during the Goryeo dynasty.

12:06.916 --> 12:11.458
So the Mongols came
and started making distilled spirits.

12:11.958 --> 12:14.541
Before then,
we didn't have distilled spirits.

12:14.625 --> 12:16.458
As they made distilled spirits

12:16.541 --> 12:18.125
we learned the technique.

12:18.208 --> 12:21.375
Andong was where they stocked up
on military supplies.

12:21.916 --> 12:24.250
They got their horses from Jeju.

12:25.041 --> 12:26.250
Then Gaeseong.

12:26.333 --> 12:28.083
The three cities sent the supplies.

12:28.166 --> 12:30.375
Some say that's the beginning
of Andong soju.

12:30.916 --> 12:33.875
In Korea, Jeju is known
for its distillation method.

12:33.958 --> 12:35.541
Gaeseong, too. It's famous.

12:36.333 --> 12:39.375
And so the distillation method
became very popular.

12:39.458 --> 12:41.916
During the Joseon dynasty,
people would make a distilled soju

12:42.000 --> 12:43.583
called gayangju, at home.

12:43.666 --> 12:45.708
So the techniques became quite advanced.

12:45.791 --> 12:49.666
But under the Japanese annexation,
Japan prohibited liquor making at home

12:49.750 --> 12:52.625
so they could collect taxes on alcohol.

12:52.708 --> 12:55.416
With the liberation,
people thought the ban would lift.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.625
But the country was so poor

12:57.708 --> 13:00.458
that the government banned
using rice to make alcohol.

13:00.541 --> 13:02.458
The series of events

13:02.541 --> 13:04.708
caused stagnation
of the distilled spirits culture.

13:05.291 --> 13:09.625
The government started controlling
the entire process

13:09.708 --> 13:11.083
so people couldn't make it.

13:11.166 --> 13:13.291
"This year, potatoes are cheap."

13:13.375 --> 13:15.583
"You can use potatoes to make jujeong."

13:15.666 --> 13:17.000
Then the alcohol from that

13:17.083 --> 13:20.750
is distributed to the soju companies
where they mix in the additives.

13:20.833 --> 13:22.833
That's how diluted soju became popular.

13:22.916 --> 13:24.625
It became mainstream later on.

13:25.125 --> 13:27.958
We're drinking nonstop
because we're talking about booze.

13:28.916 --> 13:31.250
-Since back in the day-- Excuse me!
-Yup!

13:31.333 --> 13:32.958
-We'll get another bottle.
-Sure.

13:33.666 --> 13:38.375
You see, originally, soju is made
by taking fermented alcohol

13:38.458 --> 13:40.041
-and distilling it.
-Distilled.

13:40.125 --> 13:42.291
-Like Andong soju.
-Yes, distilled liquor.

13:42.375 --> 13:45.375
You boil a perfectly well-made alcohol
to make this.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.708
You know what's funny?

13:46.791 --> 13:50.708
Do you know what people compare
the distillation process to?

13:50.791 --> 13:52.500
"Squeezing out the soul," they say.

13:53.375 --> 13:55.500
So a well-fermented alcohol,

13:55.583 --> 13:59.083
such as makgeolli or cheongju,

13:59.166 --> 14:02.208
being distilled is described as
"squeezing out its soul."

14:02.791 --> 14:05.583
Hence, "spirit."

14:05.666 --> 14:08.333
-Oh, I see.
-That's why this is

14:08.416 --> 14:10.125
-Paik's Spirit.
-Paik's Spirit.

14:13.833 --> 14:16.000
-Nice.
-I had no idea.

14:25.833 --> 14:29.875
I learned to drink later than most.

14:29.958 --> 14:32.583
I didn't drink until I was 23 or 24.

14:32.666 --> 14:34.250
Soju or alcohol in general?

14:34.333 --> 14:37.291
Alcohol.
I didn't drink soju until much later.

14:37.375 --> 14:39.625
Who'd believe that?

14:40.583 --> 14:43.000
Right? Who'd buy that?

14:44.625 --> 14:46.000
-For real?
-Yes, for real.

14:46.083 --> 14:48.541
I'd go to Hongdae
and get Long Island iced tea.

14:49.125 --> 14:50.750
I liked the tipsy feeling.

14:50.833 --> 14:54.166
And it was fun
getting drunk and hanging out with people.

14:54.875 --> 14:56.708
But as I got older,

14:56.791 --> 15:00.833
I cared less for clubs and champagne

15:00.916 --> 15:03.083
and started drinking soju.

15:03.166 --> 15:05.916
I've grown to enjoy this much more.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.666
You've matured early.

15:07.750 --> 15:10.166
And these days

15:10.250 --> 15:14.375
I'm all about making good memories
with the people that I like

15:14.458 --> 15:16.708
because I find that more meaningful.

15:16.791 --> 15:18.375
-How old are you?
-I'm 34.

15:19.375 --> 15:20.916
That's what I realize now.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.416
You talk like an older man.

15:23.958 --> 15:24.916
I guess so.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.750
I think I only started realizing that
maybe seven, eight years ago.

15:28.833 --> 15:30.375
-Really?
-You're already there.

15:30.458 --> 15:31.291
You think so?

15:31.375 --> 15:33.625
Now that we're close, I know.

15:33.708 --> 15:34.583
He's a good kid.

15:34.666 --> 15:35.666
Right.

15:36.166 --> 15:38.833
Well, at times, I'm good

15:38.916 --> 15:41.541
and there are other times
when we go loco together.

15:42.125 --> 15:43.625
You guys go loco together?

15:44.750 --> 15:46.250
So he's a college friend of mine.

15:46.958 --> 15:49.125
We've been friends
since our freshman year.

15:49.208 --> 15:51.000
And I managed to lure him

15:51.083 --> 15:53.791
into working with me.

15:53.875 --> 15:57.208
-He's seen me through my ups and downs.
-I see.

15:57.291 --> 15:58.333
Wow.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.375
How long have you worked together?

16:01.458 --> 16:03.708
We've been friends since 1985.

16:03.791 --> 16:05.958
-Since 1985?
-So it's been over 30…

16:06.041 --> 16:07.125
Friends for 35 years.

16:09.375 --> 16:11.125
You know why we became close?

16:11.208 --> 16:12.291
You'll see later.

16:12.375 --> 16:13.208
Yeah?

16:13.291 --> 16:15.458
Take a guess.
I'm sure you can tell at once.

16:15.541 --> 16:17.208
I don't think they can tell.

16:17.291 --> 16:18.375
Where's our food?

16:20.125 --> 16:22.958
-Just a moment.
-We'll get drunk on an empty stomach.

16:23.041 --> 16:24.666
PORK BELLY

18:33.750 --> 18:35.833
-Are you going to grill it yourself?
-Yes.

18:35.916 --> 18:37.583
-Will you do it?
-Yes, I'll do it.

18:37.666 --> 18:39.625
Great! I'm used to doing it myself.

18:40.708 --> 18:43.041
I see meat,
and my hands reach for the tong.

18:43.125 --> 18:44.250
It's a habit.

18:44.333 --> 18:45.708
This works for us.

19:24.333 --> 19:26.375
-There's a way to eat this.
-Please.

19:26.458 --> 19:27.583
-A unique way?
-Where?

19:27.666 --> 19:28.666
-That dish.
-Here?

19:28.750 --> 19:29.625
Yes.

19:30.125 --> 19:31.708
-Lay down a perilla leaf.
-Okay.

19:36.500 --> 19:38.166
Get some food ready.

19:38.250 --> 19:39.208
Let's do this.

19:40.250 --> 19:41.166
Let's drink, guys.

19:55.458 --> 19:56.416
Here's some wasabi.

19:59.833 --> 20:00.750
It's delicious.

20:03.125 --> 20:05.583
He squeals when he eats something good.

20:05.666 --> 20:07.750
-I get it. He's not drunk.
-I know.

20:07.833 --> 20:10.375
-I like that it's not awkward.
-Thank you.

20:10.458 --> 20:11.916
When I eat something good,

20:12.000 --> 20:14.458
-I express it.
-I praise it.

20:17.416 --> 20:20.333
-Can we get some chopped Cheongyang chili?
-Sure.

20:20.416 --> 20:22.541
-It's so good with meljeot.
-Yes.

20:22.625 --> 20:24.583
We have some chopped already.

20:24.666 --> 20:25.708
Yes.

20:32.541 --> 20:34.166
-Thank you.
-Sure.

20:39.125 --> 20:41.833
This is a bad habit of mine.
I'm so impatient.

20:41.916 --> 20:44.291
I drink before clinking glasses
with others. Cheers.

20:45.916 --> 20:47.250
Don't you love that sound?

20:58.500 --> 21:00.250
-Isn't it the best?
-It is.

21:02.333 --> 21:03.541
It's good.

21:05.458 --> 21:08.000
-How about a different cut?
-We'll eat this first.

21:14.333 --> 21:15.541
Like this.

21:28.666 --> 21:30.333
Loco, will you be all right?

21:30.416 --> 21:34.500
-That just tasted like water too.
-Nice.

21:34.583 --> 21:35.750
Yes.

21:36.583 --> 21:38.708
-Do you like samgyeopsal?
-I do.

21:38.791 --> 21:40.041
I don't bother asking him.

21:40.125 --> 21:41.583
Is he a vegetarian?

21:41.666 --> 21:43.375
-No.
-Because he struggled back then?

21:43.458 --> 21:46.000
This is the biggest reason
we became friends.

21:46.083 --> 21:47.125
He doesn't eat.

21:49.333 --> 21:52.083
There were six of us
who always hung out together.

21:52.166 --> 21:55.583
We'd get seated at a restaurant
and who you sit next to matters.

21:55.666 --> 21:58.000
Let's say we went to a Chinese restaurant.

21:58.083 --> 22:00.375
-His food becomes mine.
-I see.

22:00.458 --> 22:01.333
He doesn't eat.

22:02.250 --> 22:05.500
I'm a glutton.
I like to eat a lot no matter what it is.

22:05.583 --> 22:08.458
-I used to be like that.
-You're still like that.

22:08.541 --> 22:09.625
No.

22:09.708 --> 22:11.458
So he's a light eater?

22:11.541 --> 22:12.458
-Somewhat.
-A bit.

22:12.541 --> 22:15.958
But when it comes to booze,
he goes all out.

22:16.041 --> 22:18.291
You better be ready
when you drink with him.

22:19.083 --> 22:20.416
He drinks all night.

22:20.500 --> 22:21.458
You come across

22:22.208 --> 22:24.250
as very serious.

22:24.333 --> 22:26.375
-Me?
-Yeah, you are quiet too.

22:26.458 --> 22:27.375
He needs more.

22:28.583 --> 22:30.166
Just kidding. He's never flippant.

22:30.666 --> 22:32.291
Isn't this better?

22:32.375 --> 22:34.416
If he's not talking, he looks important.

22:34.500 --> 22:36.083
Look at me. I look like a joke.

22:36.958 --> 22:39.416
-You two make the perfect team.
-That's right.

22:39.500 --> 22:41.166
You've got good chemistry.

22:53.041 --> 22:56.000
What do you usually pair soju with
when you're in Korea?

22:57.208 --> 22:59.416
Actually, I rarely drink when I eat.

22:59.500 --> 23:01.666
-Really? Then what?
-I usually keep it separate.

23:01.750 --> 23:03.958
Food and alcohol, that is.

23:04.041 --> 23:08.291
I think it's my first time
having soju with Jay

23:08.375 --> 23:09.958
-at a place like this.
-Really?

23:10.041 --> 23:11.625
-Is this a generation gap?
-No.

23:11.708 --> 23:13.958
We almost always had soju
at a samgyeopsal place.

23:14.041 --> 23:15.041
-Really?
-Yeah.

23:15.125 --> 23:16.791
-Wrong location today?
-No.

23:16.875 --> 23:19.083
For team dinners,

23:19.166 --> 23:20.916
nothing beats samgyeopsal and soju.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.125
That's what we do for our team dinners.

23:23.208 --> 23:24.041
Right.

23:24.125 --> 23:26.208
-It's the safest choice.
-True.

23:26.291 --> 23:28.041
Anything else is just not the same.

23:28.125 --> 23:29.125
Something about this

23:29.208 --> 23:31.041
-just feels right.
-Exactly.

23:31.125 --> 23:32.500
It wasn't long ago

23:33.500 --> 23:35.583
that Koreans started eating so much pork.

23:35.666 --> 23:36.666
Oh, really?

23:37.166 --> 23:39.625
Back in the day, we ate beef.

23:40.541 --> 23:42.541
-For real.
-Beef? Then?

23:42.625 --> 23:43.500
-Yeah.
-Really?

23:43.583 --> 23:45.458
-But beef is more expensive.
-Exactly.

23:45.541 --> 23:47.791
You see, people used to think

23:48.291 --> 23:50.791
-that pigs are dirty.
-I see.

23:50.875 --> 23:52.958
-The way they're raised.
-Lazy.

23:53.041 --> 23:56.208
All they do is eat, really.
But cows are useful.

23:56.291 --> 23:58.583
That's why people ate more beef back then.

23:58.666 --> 24:00.250
It only changed recently.

24:00.333 --> 24:03.125
It was in the 1970s.

24:03.208 --> 24:04.541
People needed protein.

24:04.625 --> 24:07.291
So they started large-scale pig farming.

24:07.375 --> 24:09.333
The government promoted it.

24:09.416 --> 24:12.875
Interesting, isn't it?
It's fun to hear when you drink.

24:15.333 --> 24:18.250
Do you know which company

24:18.333 --> 24:20.666
started large-scale pig farming in Korea?

24:23.041 --> 24:26.416
-In Korea?
-Samsung? Lotte?

24:26.500 --> 24:28.625
-That was a shot in the dark, right?
-Yes.

24:28.708 --> 24:30.500
-It was Samsung.
-No way!

24:31.625 --> 24:33.208
-Funny, isn't it?
-Yes, kind of.

24:33.291 --> 24:37.166
Samsung was the first company
to start large-scale pig farming.

24:37.250 --> 24:38.083
Guess where?

24:38.166 --> 24:41.708
-Busan?
-Which of the Samsung affiliates

24:41.791 --> 24:46.041
occupies the biggest land
just outside of Seoul?

24:46.125 --> 24:46.958
Want a hint?

24:47.958 --> 24:50.875
-What?
-Lotte has one too. In Jamsil.

24:50.958 --> 24:53.250
Do you know?

24:53.333 --> 24:54.416
Do you know Everland?

24:54.500 --> 24:56.583
-Samsung owns that?
-Yes, it's in Yongin.

24:57.291 --> 24:58.375
-Yongin Everland.
-No!

24:58.458 --> 25:00.875
Samsung owns Everland.
Look at you all surprised.

25:00.958 --> 25:02.666
-It's Samsung's.
-Right.

25:02.750 --> 25:04.833
-You knew?
-Nope.

25:05.500 --> 25:08.125
Do you know
what Everland was formerly called?

25:08.208 --> 25:09.958
-I do.
-What?

25:10.041 --> 25:11.958
-Jayeon Nongwon.
-Yes, as in "natural farm."

25:12.041 --> 25:14.166
-Jayeon Nongwon?
-Yes, Yongin Jayeon Nongwon.

25:14.250 --> 25:15.083
That was it.

25:15.166 --> 25:17.416
It was like an animal park of a sort.

25:17.500 --> 25:20.041
It was named that way

25:20.125 --> 25:23.750
because the founder of Samsung,
Lee Byung-chul,

25:23.833 --> 25:27.041
built a large-scale pig farm there.

25:27.625 --> 25:28.625
Right there.

25:29.208 --> 25:32.458
But then the farmers got all angry.

25:32.541 --> 25:34.500
"A big conglomerate is taking us over."

25:34.583 --> 25:35.625
A huge backlash.

25:35.708 --> 25:37.333
They had to stop.

25:38.791 --> 25:40.000
So instead,

25:40.083 --> 25:42.250
they built an amusement park, Everland.

25:42.333 --> 25:43.291
-Really?
-Yeah.

25:43.375 --> 25:44.375
Is that true?

25:45.208 --> 25:48.625
Think about it. It's ironic.

25:48.708 --> 25:50.791
Samsung makes the world's best

25:50.875 --> 25:52.875
-phones and semiconductors now.
-Electronics.

25:52.958 --> 25:57.000
But imagine if there hadn't been
a backlash from the pig farms

25:57.083 --> 25:59.916
and Samsung was successful
at large-scale pig farming

26:00.000 --> 26:01.333
No semiconductors.

26:01.416 --> 26:03.708
-Right.
-Not even that.

26:03.791 --> 26:07.500
Instead of being known for cell phones,
they could've been known for the pork.

26:07.583 --> 26:09.541
And we'd be saying, "Eat Samsung pork."

26:10.625 --> 26:14.458
INFINITY
11.8 IN DYNAMIC RANGE

26:15.458 --> 26:18.291
VARIETY
THICK OR THIN, THE CHOICE IS YOURS

26:18.375 --> 26:19.333
FOLDABLE
OH-SO-PORTABLE

26:21.291 --> 26:23.166
THIS IS REVOLUTIONARY EVOLUTION

26:25.166 --> 26:28.166
It hasn't been long
since Korea started eating a lot of pork.

26:28.250 --> 26:29.875
The same goes for samgyeopsal.

26:29.958 --> 26:32.083
This cut of pork became popular recently.

26:32.166 --> 26:34.291
The cut didn't exist back in the day.

26:34.375 --> 26:37.708
Here's another theory about Gaeseong.

26:37.791 --> 26:41.208
It has three layers.
So it was called segyeopsal.

26:41.291 --> 26:43.458
People in Gaeseong
wanted to sell sam, ginseng,

26:43.541 --> 26:47.041
and named it samgyeopsal
saying that they're best eaten together.

26:47.125 --> 26:49.083
Gaeseong is known for ginseng.

26:49.166 --> 26:50.000
Ginseng.

26:50.083 --> 26:52.750
So one theory is the ginseng story.

26:52.833 --> 26:53.833
That's a theory?

26:53.916 --> 26:55.166
THEORY

26:55.250 --> 26:58.958
Some say it got the name
because sam also means "three."

26:59.041 --> 27:01.791
-Samgyeopsal is a recent thing.
-You and your theories.

27:01.875 --> 27:04.083
-I know many theories.
-We need more soju.

27:04.166 --> 27:06.583
-You know so many.
-I can go on all night.

27:06.666 --> 27:08.458
-One more bottle, please!
-Sure.

27:11.416 --> 27:14.333
Come on. Be more generous.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.208
Don't be generous to me.

27:18.833 --> 27:22.458
-Come on, take my love.
-Okay.

27:24.291 --> 27:25.125
Okay.

27:28.250 --> 27:30.500
-A lot of stories to tell with a drink.
-Yes.

27:30.583 --> 27:32.666
When you want to talk about food, I'm it.

27:33.166 --> 27:34.291
So funny.

27:41.375 --> 27:43.416
I'm suddenly curious.

27:43.500 --> 27:47.208
Why is booze called "sul" in Korean?

27:47.291 --> 27:49.458
Why sul?

27:49.541 --> 27:51.500
-Why is it called sul?
-Yes.

27:51.583 --> 27:53.208
There are many theories.

27:53.291 --> 27:55.958
When you make makgeolli
and leave it overnight,

27:56.041 --> 27:58.166
you see the bubbles rise as it ferments.

27:58.250 --> 27:59.125
Right.

27:59.208 --> 28:01.583
It looks like it's boiling,
as if it's on fire.

28:01.666 --> 28:03.708
So people called it "subul," water fire.

28:03.791 --> 28:06.250
Over time, "subul" became "suul"

28:06.333 --> 28:07.958
then "sueul," and finally "sul."

28:08.041 --> 28:08.916
Like that.

28:10.291 --> 28:12.833
-It's just a theory.
-It is?

28:12.916 --> 28:15.416
Everything that I didn't witness
is a theory to me.

28:15.916 --> 28:17.166
THEORY

28:17.250 --> 28:20.833
-We also drink through our lips.
-"Ipsul" for lips.

28:20.916 --> 28:23.875
If you keep telling people that
about 50 years later,

28:23.958 --> 28:26.166
it could be told like a fact.

28:26.250 --> 28:29.625
And then someone like me would come along…

28:29.708 --> 28:31.125
-Right.
-…and talk about it

28:31.208 --> 28:32.958
That "sul" came from "ipsul."

28:33.041 --> 28:34.291
And say, "It's a theory."

28:37.083 --> 28:38.875
-My glass is empty.
-Here.

28:40.375 --> 28:42.333
When the food's ready, fill your glass.

28:54.625 --> 28:56.291
Never pour your own drink.

28:56.375 --> 28:57.375
-All right.
-Here.

28:57.458 --> 29:00.333
-Here.
-Cheers.

29:12.541 --> 29:13.541
Excuse me!

29:13.625 --> 29:15.083
-Sir.
-Can we get more meat?

29:15.166 --> 29:17.333
-Which cut would you like?
-Samgyeopsal.

29:17.416 --> 29:19.166
-Samgyeopsal?
-Samgyeopsal is good.

29:19.250 --> 29:20.083
Yeah?

29:20.166 --> 29:21.791
It's really good.

29:25.083 --> 29:26.541
Here's your water.

29:29.875 --> 29:31.291
It's been a while. So good.

29:34.333 --> 29:35.958
I couldn't even eat perilla leaves.

29:36.041 --> 29:39.000
-Really? Too fragrant?
-Yeah.

29:39.083 --> 29:40.208
Thanks to you guys.

29:40.291 --> 29:43.000
Thanks to K-pop,
the Korean drinking and food culture

29:43.083 --> 29:44.833
has become a world trend.

29:44.916 --> 29:46.833
-I know.
-I run many restaurants in China.

29:46.916 --> 29:48.041
K-pop fans would come

29:48.125 --> 29:50.333
and eat and drink soju

29:50.416 --> 29:51.666
just like we do.

29:51.750 --> 29:52.791
Right.

29:52.875 --> 29:55.000
They know words like "geonbae" or "obba."

29:55.083 --> 29:57.833
-They use those words.
-Yeah.

29:57.916 --> 30:01.250
The thing people struggle with at first
is perilla leaves.

30:37.333 --> 30:44.333
PERILLA LEAVES

30:45.708 --> 30:48.250
It's like us going into
a Chinese restaurant

30:48.333 --> 30:50.041
and asking about cilantro.

30:50.125 --> 30:52.041
They brag about being able to eat it.

30:52.125 --> 30:53.541
Really? That's fascinating.

30:53.625 --> 30:56.791
They say you're not a true fan
if you can't eat perilla leaves.

30:56.875 --> 30:57.708
I see.

30:57.791 --> 31:00.250
When I go to my restaurants abroad,

31:00.333 --> 31:02.041
I see people bringing friends

31:02.125 --> 31:04.833
to show them how to eat perilla wraps.

31:04.916 --> 31:07.833
It's an acquired taste.

31:07.916 --> 31:09.125
It's funny, really.

31:09.208 --> 31:12.666
I've only lived in Korea for 15 years

31:12.750 --> 31:15.375
and I already feel this way.
There's something

31:15.458 --> 31:17.500
appealing about the Korean culture.

31:17.583 --> 31:20.875
Something that pulls you in.
Something in the water.

31:20.958 --> 31:24.041
It means you've gone out for drinks
with lots of people here.

31:24.125 --> 31:27.250
Would you say
soju is your favorite liquor?

31:27.875 --> 31:29.875
-Well…
-He even has a song titled "SOJU."

31:29.958 --> 31:32.625
-Right?
-It was his first single in the US.

31:32.708 --> 31:34.375
-Right?
-Yes.

31:34.458 --> 31:37.791
It's one of the best-selling liquors

31:37.875 --> 31:40.041
but when you ask Americans about soju,

31:40.125 --> 31:41.791
about half of them say

31:42.708 --> 31:44.666
that they don't know what it is.

31:44.750 --> 31:47.416
Everyone knows sake or vodka

31:47.500 --> 31:48.875
but not soju.

31:48.958 --> 31:52.541
So we removed the label

31:52.625 --> 31:54.625
and put our sticker on for publicity.

31:54.708 --> 31:56.541
-In Korea or the US?
-US.

31:56.625 --> 32:00.333
SOJU
JAY PARK FT. 2CHAINZ

32:25.708 --> 32:27.541
HIP-HOP SOJU

32:27.625 --> 32:29.500
I get it. In other countries

32:29.583 --> 32:32.583
famous pop stars or celebrities
have their brands of alcohol.

32:32.666 --> 32:34.625
-Exactly.
-Some own tequila brands.

32:34.708 --> 32:36.708
So that's when you thought
of the soju brand.

32:36.791 --> 32:38.458
Something like that.

32:38.541 --> 32:40.166
Jay-Z owns Armand de Brignac.

32:40.250 --> 32:41.291
-D'Ussé.
-Right.

32:41.375 --> 32:44.416
-George Clooney has Casamigos.
-Right, he started a tequila brand.

32:44.500 --> 32:46.291
No Korean celebrity has done it.

32:46.375 --> 32:49.250
So I thought it'd be nice
to be the first to do it.

32:49.333 --> 32:52.041
That was a part of it.
And I was hoping I might help.

32:52.125 --> 32:53.875
There are K-pop fans too,

32:53.958 --> 32:57.208
but the hip-hop fans who aren't into K-pop
could like our music

32:57.291 --> 32:58.666
and we could be the channel

32:58.750 --> 33:02.750
through which we could showcase
the charm of Korea.

33:02.833 --> 33:04.125
Full of surprises, isn't he?

33:04.708 --> 33:06.750
-He's very thoughtful.
-He is.

33:06.833 --> 33:10.916
This is why
you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.

33:15.750 --> 33:17.875
-Did you always have this?
-Yes.

33:17.958 --> 33:19.166
Why haven't I seen it?

33:19.250 --> 33:20.750
I have to cover it for TV shows.

33:20.833 --> 33:22.750
-What does it say?
-H1GHR Music.

33:22.833 --> 33:24.833
I started AOMG seven years ago.

33:24.916 --> 33:26.875
H1GHR Music, I started three years ago.

33:26.958 --> 33:29.791
-Another tat if you start a new business?
-Possibly.

33:30.291 --> 33:32.208
I could get one for each of my companies.

33:32.291 --> 33:34.166
-"Saemaul," "Paik's Noodle."
-Exactly.

33:34.250 --> 33:37.250
What about your face on the right chest?

33:37.958 --> 33:38.916
It's too late.

33:40.041 --> 33:42.125
-It'd be nice, you know.
-Yeah.

33:47.208 --> 33:48.750
-Excuse me.
-Yeah.

33:48.833 --> 33:50.166
-One more.
-One more soju.

33:50.250 --> 33:53.500
How about some jjigae?
Perhaps sundubu jjigae?

33:53.583 --> 33:55.166
One gyeranjjim and one jjigae.

33:55.916 --> 33:57.166
Sundubu sounds good.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.000
-Make it spicy.
-Yup.

33:59.083 --> 34:00.166
-Thanks.
-And the soju.

34:00.250 --> 34:01.125
Sure.

34:04.083 --> 34:06.000
GYERANJJIM & SUNDUBU

36:02.083 --> 36:04.000
This is insanely good.

36:04.083 --> 36:06.000
-Isn't it?
-Sorry?

36:06.083 --> 36:09.166
This is the trick.
Putting bits of meat in the jjigae.

36:10.041 --> 36:11.833
-Did you see it?
-I saw it.

36:11.916 --> 36:15.250
Seriously, wow. This is crazy good.
I can't even…

36:15.333 --> 36:16.833
Hold on. Yup.

36:19.416 --> 36:21.500
This is what dreams are made of.

36:21.583 --> 36:22.958
We'll chop more in.

36:23.041 --> 36:25.000
See? It matters whom you eat meat with.

36:25.083 --> 36:26.708
If I may, since we are wrapping up.

36:26.791 --> 36:28.625
Let me show off a little.

36:28.708 --> 36:30.875
Am I the best meat buddy or what?

36:30.958 --> 36:31.791
'Spirit.'

36:33.375 --> 36:36.041
I put my soul into this jjigae.

36:37.041 --> 36:38.750
Gotta use all your resources.

36:39.291 --> 36:41.541
I feel warm because of the alcohol.

36:41.625 --> 36:44.375
-Yeah.
-I start to feel the sweat coming.

36:44.458 --> 36:46.833
-Let's have another shot.
-One more?

36:53.541 --> 36:55.291
Do you know why we clink our glasses?

36:55.375 --> 36:57.208
Well?

36:58.791 --> 37:01.041
-Because it sounds nice?
-That too.

37:02.708 --> 37:03.583
Here's a theory.

37:03.666 --> 37:06.791
We didn't top up just now
but if we did, the drinks would mix.

37:06.875 --> 37:08.541
Oh, I see.

37:08.625 --> 37:10.583
During wartime in the Middle Ages

37:10.666 --> 37:12.291
someone could poison your drink.

37:12.375 --> 37:15.375
So if someone offered you a drink,
you wouldn't trust it.

37:15.458 --> 37:17.750
But if you do this,
the drinks mix a little.

37:17.833 --> 37:19.500
If it was poisoned, we all die.

37:19.583 --> 37:20.541
Right.

37:21.041 --> 37:23.208
Just a theory.

37:23.291 --> 37:26.500
You mentioned the sound earlier.
When we drink,

37:26.583 --> 37:30.375
we look at the color,
then we taste the flavor

37:30.458 --> 37:32.166
and use our five senses.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.625
We smell it.

37:34.125 --> 37:36.833
Then we feel the texture.

37:36.916 --> 37:38.333
What's left then?

37:39.291 --> 37:40.375
Our sense of hearing.

37:41.041 --> 37:44.333
The four senses are engaged.

37:44.416 --> 37:46.291
But this way, you engage hearing too.

37:47.291 --> 37:48.625
Right?

37:48.708 --> 37:49.958
THEORY

37:50.583 --> 37:53.125
Everything you say sounds believable.

37:53.208 --> 37:55.708
-It does!
-I'd buy it.

37:55.791 --> 37:58.541
Seriously though, it's an actual theory.

38:03.375 --> 38:05.250
Clinking glasses lifts your spirits.

38:05.333 --> 38:08.791
-The experience is incomplete without it.
-It makes it go down better.

38:09.291 --> 38:11.916
-Have you heard of MC Sniper?
-Yes.

38:12.000 --> 38:15.333
He and I
used to drink soju together often.

38:15.416 --> 38:17.125
He's kind of stingy

38:17.208 --> 38:19.166
but he's good with words.

38:19.250 --> 38:20.541
-For example…
-Like a toast?

38:20.625 --> 38:22.500
-Yeah.
-Like what?

38:22.583 --> 38:24.541
For instance, he'd suddenly say,

38:24.625 --> 38:25.666
"Loco.

38:27.416 --> 38:30.416
We were here today."

38:30.500 --> 38:32.000
Something like that.

38:32.583 --> 38:34.750
-I don't get it.
-I'm against that.

38:34.833 --> 38:37.541
-Remember? Right before we went bankrupt.
-Yup.

38:37.625 --> 38:39.375
We had many single male employees.

38:39.458 --> 38:44.291
As the CEO, I can predict what's coming.

38:44.875 --> 38:47.833
Like, we can't pay
the creditors right now.

38:47.916 --> 38:49.375
-We manage somehow.
-Yeah.

38:49.458 --> 38:51.125
Then there's the following month.

38:51.208 --> 38:54.375
I could see the future ahead of me.
That's the scariest feeling.

38:55.708 --> 38:58.416
Then what I'd do
is start preparing to sink.

38:58.500 --> 38:59.500
Prepare for the shock.

38:59.583 --> 39:03.500
Just like putting on a seat belt
to protect yourself from a collision.

39:03.583 --> 39:05.583
You prepare for the shock.

39:05.666 --> 39:07.250
I'd gather up my bachelor staff

39:07.333 --> 39:11.833
and say, "This is life. Let's do this.
At least die trying. We got this."

39:11.916 --> 39:13.083
Drink every day.

39:13.166 --> 39:14.375
Drank back then too.

39:14.916 --> 39:17.791
All the young employees were like,

39:17.875 --> 39:20.750
"Sir! We're in this together.
You have our loyalty."

39:21.916 --> 39:22.750
All of them.

39:23.250 --> 39:25.958
Singing, drinking, bonding.

39:26.458 --> 39:29.625
My favorite song at the time
was called "Life Is."

39:30.208 --> 39:31.708
-"Life Is" and so on.
-Right.

39:31.791 --> 39:33.500
-A tear-jerker.
-Sang it every day.

39:33.583 --> 39:36.541
I felt the end coming
but I could hold out 'cause I had my guys.

39:36.625 --> 39:37.708
In the end, they left.

39:40.125 --> 39:41.625
-Seriously?
-Seriously.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.125
-That was a big lesson for me.
-Right.

39:45.208 --> 39:46.166
Really.

39:46.250 --> 39:48.333
I never give a toast at team dinners now.

39:49.083 --> 39:49.958
It's a formality.

39:50.625 --> 39:52.541
-Right.
-It feels good at the moment

39:52.625 --> 39:54.500
but why make promises you can't keep?

39:54.583 --> 39:56.416
-I've never done it.
-True.

39:56.500 --> 39:59.083
-For seven years, not once.
-Don't.

39:59.791 --> 40:01.291
Paik here,

40:01.375 --> 40:03.875
he tends to entrust a person with a task.

40:03.958 --> 40:05.500
-It's his strength.
-Right.

40:05.583 --> 40:09.333
And sometimes, it leads to good results

40:09.416 --> 40:11.250
-but not always.
-True.

40:11.833 --> 40:13.500
But it's all a learning process.

40:13.583 --> 40:16.291
-This guy's still with me.
-I've learned a lot.

40:16.875 --> 40:19.958
-Exactly.
-He takes care of everything for me.

40:20.041 --> 40:23.125
We are what we are
because of our painful past.

40:23.208 --> 40:24.291
-Right.
-It was hard.

40:24.375 --> 40:26.833
When my company went bust
during the IMF crisis,

40:26.916 --> 40:29.375
I let everyone go
so I could sort things out.

40:29.875 --> 40:31.875
I sent everyone home.

40:31.958 --> 40:34.333
It was rough
sorting everything out on my own.

40:34.416 --> 40:36.708
What's great about this guy

40:36.791 --> 40:39.833
is when I was able
to stabilize my business,

40:39.916 --> 40:42.583
I contacted him first to join me.
Guess what he said.

40:42.666 --> 40:44.250
"Hey, I'm doing all right."

40:45.000 --> 40:47.166
If his wife found out,
she'd be really mad.

40:47.250 --> 40:49.708
He said, "My wife's working,
and I'm doing all right."

40:49.791 --> 40:52.166
Then he told me
to rehire other people first.

40:52.250 --> 40:53.583
"Bring him back first."

40:53.666 --> 40:56.166
My former employees
who were struggling financially.

40:56.250 --> 40:57.666
"Rehire him first."

40:57.750 --> 41:00.083
So he ended up being
the fourth or so that I rehired.

41:00.166 --> 41:02.500
He told me to do so.

41:02.583 --> 41:07.208
What was the reason or motivation
that kept you by his side?

41:07.291 --> 41:09.250
Was it really about loyalty?

41:09.333 --> 41:11.333
No, I think it was meant to be that way.

41:11.416 --> 41:14.375
Whether you call that feeling or loyalty,

41:14.458 --> 41:16.083
I think it was meant to be.

41:16.875 --> 41:19.125
-It's loyalty. Say it's loyalty.
-Right?

41:19.208 --> 41:22.000
-Here.
-It's very inspiring.

41:22.083 --> 41:25.291
The relationship you two have
and having such a loyal friend.

41:25.375 --> 41:26.208
Definitely.

41:26.291 --> 41:28.666
Everything you've done. How to put this?

41:28.750 --> 41:30.041
I'd say…

41:33.916 --> 41:38.500
It's not something you can have
just because you want it.

41:39.458 --> 41:41.666
When I got married…
He doesn't dye his hair.

41:42.250 --> 41:44.833
He never dyes his hair
but he did it once, for my wedding.

41:45.541 --> 41:46.750
I told him all the time.

41:46.833 --> 41:50.416
"Hey, can you cover your gray hair?
You embarrass me.

41:50.500 --> 41:51.875
Dye it for my wedding."

41:51.958 --> 41:53.500
And he really did it.

41:53.583 --> 41:56.583
-Did you dye it black?
-Yes, I'll tell you why.

41:56.666 --> 42:02.583
-Back then, we were in our mid-40s.
-Right.

42:02.666 --> 42:05.791
I didn't want people
to think that we were not serious.

42:06.375 --> 42:09.041
-Right.
-He didn't like that.

42:09.125 --> 42:10.125
Have you had?

42:10.208 --> 42:12.291
Like you, I started my business
at a young age.

42:12.375 --> 42:15.125
I started it when I was in my late 20s.

42:15.208 --> 42:19.125
-I wanted people to take me seriously.
-You wanted to be taken seriously.

42:19.208 --> 42:21.833
I tried to look and act more maturely.

42:21.916 --> 42:24.125
Well, I have this.

42:24.208 --> 42:26.875
There's nothing I can do
about the way I look.

42:26.958 --> 42:28.583
But I'm more direct about it.

42:28.666 --> 42:31.041
"So how shall we
proceed with this contract?"

42:31.125 --> 42:32.833
-I discuss the terms.
-Professionally.

42:32.916 --> 42:37.333
The meeting was arranged with a purpose,
so I get straight to the point.

42:37.416 --> 42:41.583
I know they would've ditched us already
if my company wasn't successful.

42:41.666 --> 42:42.875
I know that much.

42:42.958 --> 42:43.875
They're objective.

42:43.958 --> 42:46.791
So I treat them the same way.

42:46.875 --> 42:48.000
I keep it objective.

42:48.083 --> 42:51.791
Many people
want to take advantage of his name.

42:51.875 --> 42:52.750
-So…
-Right.

42:52.833 --> 42:55.041
I learned then
that I'm free to sign any contract

42:55.125 --> 42:58.375
and that I need to be
very careful about it.

42:58.458 --> 43:01.791
I'm sure he can relate to it too,

43:01.875 --> 43:04.000
but CEOs have this thing.

43:04.083 --> 43:06.916
Your decision can have
such important consequences.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.208
-Right.
-It can affect many people's lives.

43:09.291 --> 43:11.083
It can make or break the business.

43:11.166 --> 43:12.083
Exactly.

43:12.166 --> 43:13.291
You feel responsible.

43:13.375 --> 43:16.166
-Everyone cries once.
-I'm sure.

43:16.250 --> 43:19.666
Jong-won doesn't show it.

43:19.750 --> 43:22.625
-I'm sure he cries alone somewhere.
-Right.

43:22.708 --> 43:24.750
-He must've shed so many tears.
-Right.

43:24.833 --> 43:27.583
I cried a lot, even during my sleep.

43:27.666 --> 43:30.500
But I rarely cry in front of others.
It's not cool.

43:30.583 --> 43:32.500
We like to keep it cool.

43:33.250 --> 43:35.000
I know I should show my feelings.

43:35.500 --> 43:39.916
But there's this odd social image

43:40.000 --> 43:42.458
-that being tough means otherwise.
-Right.

43:42.541 --> 43:44.541
As the boss, you can't be weak. You know?

43:44.625 --> 43:45.708
You mean like,

43:45.791 --> 43:47.833
people asking you if you're all right.

43:47.916 --> 43:52.291
And bring you a tissue and whatnot.

43:52.916 --> 43:54.708
Even to wipe my sweat. I hate that.

43:54.791 --> 43:57.166
It's like bosses aren't allowed to sweat.

43:57.250 --> 43:58.833
It's a problem, really.

43:58.916 --> 44:01.166
He needs to learn to relax more.

44:01.250 --> 44:03.083
-It's hard.
-I really should.

44:03.166 --> 44:04.166
-It's a lot.
-It is.

44:04.791 --> 44:07.041
-I'm sure it's hard for you sometimes.
-Yes.

44:07.125 --> 44:09.208
I wish he'd share.

44:09.291 --> 44:11.791
-It must be stressful.
-Korean culture can be that way.

44:12.541 --> 44:17.083
My lifestyle, even drinking habits
take after him.

44:17.708 --> 44:21.125
I met him when I was little.

44:21.208 --> 44:24.166
So I look up to him as my role model.

44:25.625 --> 44:27.250
I try to copy him and stuff.

44:27.333 --> 44:28.833
Be honest with me.

44:28.916 --> 44:32.583
Are there other artists
who look up to him at your label?

44:32.666 --> 44:33.750
So many of them.

44:33.833 --> 44:35.458
-Stop it.
-For real.

44:35.541 --> 44:37.541
You drink to be frank with each other.

44:37.625 --> 44:38.875
Want me to say the same?

44:38.958 --> 44:39.875
No, don't.

44:41.291 --> 44:42.833
-Please don't.
-Thank goodness.

44:43.666 --> 44:45.083
Be honest, now.

44:45.166 --> 44:46.416
But really.

44:47.916 --> 44:49.958
The artists at our label.

44:50.041 --> 44:54.625
Many of them had their lives changed
thanks to Jay.

44:54.708 --> 44:55.958
-Really?
-I'm one of them.

44:56.041 --> 44:59.458
He paid the penalty
to get me out of a contract

44:59.541 --> 45:02.708
with my old agency
so he could sign with me.

45:02.791 --> 45:04.166
-To sign with you?
-Yes.

45:04.250 --> 45:07.291
That was back in 2014.

45:07.375 --> 45:11.291
I had to pull in over 100 million won
for me to have an income

45:11.375 --> 45:12.750
because he lent me money.

45:12.833 --> 45:14.125
-Right.
-Yeah.

45:14.208 --> 45:15.541
And I knew then too.

45:15.625 --> 45:17.166
People around him were asking

45:17.250 --> 45:21.916
if it was worth investing
so much money to bring me in.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.250
-You knew about it?
-Well.

45:23.333 --> 45:25.416
-It's not that they disliked him.
-Right.

45:25.500 --> 45:29.875
We were a very small company at the time.

45:29.958 --> 45:32.291
And even for me, tens of million of won…

45:32.375 --> 45:33.708
It's a hefty sum.

45:33.791 --> 45:35.458
…was a considerable amount.

45:35.541 --> 45:37.916
It had nothing to do with Loco.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.291
So I had this one song.

45:40.375 --> 45:44.250
I released it
three months after I signed with Jay.

45:44.333 --> 45:48.333
And that song topped
the Korean music chart…

45:48.416 --> 45:49.458
What's it called?

45:49.541 --> 45:51.708
-"Hold Me Tight."
-I don't know it.

45:53.166 --> 45:54.458
Sorry I asked.

45:54.541 --> 45:56.541
-I might recognize it if I hear it.
-Yes.

45:57.208 --> 45:58.500
-So…
-2013?

45:58.583 --> 46:00.000
What was I doing then?

46:00.083 --> 46:01.916
-In 2013?
-Yeah.

46:02.000 --> 46:03.166
You got married.

46:03.250 --> 46:05.791
-Right.
-No wonder you don't know it.

46:05.875 --> 46:09.833
Anyway, I got off to such a good start
thanks to Jay.

46:09.916 --> 46:13.833
I think of him as my savior.

46:14.416 --> 46:16.250
That's not an easy thing to say.

46:16.333 --> 46:19.416
It's not easy
to feel that way about your boss.

46:25.041 --> 46:27.250
IN EVERY MOMENT OF DESPAIR

46:30.541 --> 46:32.750
HIS FRIEND WAS BY HIS SIDE

46:41.583 --> 46:43.083
AT THE END OF HIS DESPAIR

46:44.750 --> 46:47.666
HIS FRIEND WAS STILL BY HIS SIDE

46:47.750 --> 46:49.291
I'm so grateful to Loco

46:49.375 --> 46:51.291
because he's the one friend

46:51.375 --> 46:55.375
who hasn't changed much from before.

46:55.458 --> 46:58.125
I respect that about him.

46:58.208 --> 46:59.500
-Right.
-Yeah.

46:59.583 --> 47:01.208
He only changes when he's drunk.

47:02.416 --> 47:03.250
Exactly.

47:03.333 --> 47:05.666
But thanks to him,

47:05.750 --> 47:08.166
AOMG was able to grow.

47:08.250 --> 47:09.291
Because at first,

47:09.375 --> 47:12.416
I put my trust in him
knowing I was taking on a risk.

47:12.500 --> 47:15.750
But he did such a great job
that it worked out for both of us.

47:15.833 --> 47:21.541
I like to think that it sets us apart
from other labels.

47:21.625 --> 47:23.333
How old were you when you started?

47:23.416 --> 47:25.666
AOMG was founded seven years ago

47:25.750 --> 47:28.250
and I'm 34 now, so 27.

47:28.333 --> 47:31.166
-You and I are very similar.
-You started right around then.

47:31.250 --> 47:32.291
Really?

47:33.041 --> 47:35.291
You're 34 now? It's been seven years?

47:35.375 --> 47:36.791
That's when I went bankrupt.

47:38.916 --> 47:40.916
-Hold on.
-Nah.

47:42.208 --> 47:44.333
You won't ever go bankrupt.

47:44.416 --> 47:49.291
I went out of business
because of the IMF crisis.

47:49.375 --> 47:50.916
-It was bad timing.
-It was.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.916
It wasn't my fault.
Everyone went bankrupt then.

47:54.000 --> 47:54.958
Right.

47:57.000 --> 47:58.541
We have you…

47:59.375 --> 48:00.541
-Yeah.
-…so we are good.

48:00.625 --> 48:03.166
If you ever made a mistake…

48:03.250 --> 48:05.458
Not that you would. I trust you.

48:05.541 --> 48:07.833
But if I see the signs, I'll let you know.

48:07.916 --> 48:09.291
I'll always be here.

48:10.375 --> 48:12.750
-It's an honor.
-Can we get some mugeunji?

48:12.833 --> 48:13.708
Yup.

48:15.083 --> 48:17.291
Actually,

48:17.375 --> 48:19.541
when I was young,

48:20.125 --> 48:22.250
there was an event

48:22.333 --> 48:25.125
where Jay was criticized
by the entire Korean public.

48:25.208 --> 48:26.541
What happened then?

48:27.541 --> 48:30.333
-Right.
-I really don't know.

48:30.416 --> 48:33.791
You see, I was born in the US.

48:33.875 --> 48:37.125
Back then,
my family was struggling financially.

48:37.208 --> 48:39.125
My father was in Korea

48:39.208 --> 48:41.291
while my mother, brother, and I
were in the US.

48:41.375 --> 48:42.791
Then…

48:44.000 --> 48:45.416
we had a bit of a situation,

48:46.291 --> 48:49.625
and my mother suggested
that I move to Korea for my future.

48:49.708 --> 48:50.791
-Move here?
-Right.

48:50.875 --> 48:52.541
Because back then

48:52.625 --> 48:56.500
JYP Entertainment had Rain, g.o.d.

48:56.583 --> 48:58.500
Solid artists.

48:58.583 --> 48:59.750
Because it was JYP.

48:59.833 --> 49:01.291
Back then, I didn't know.

49:01.375 --> 49:05.291
I just decided to go
because it's for my family.

49:05.375 --> 49:09.333
But it was so different
from what I expected, so it was tough.

49:09.416 --> 49:13.375
I was living away from my mom and brother
for the first time.

49:13.458 --> 49:17.583
I'd given up my friends
and my life there to be here.

49:17.666 --> 49:18.958
It felt utterly foreign.

49:19.041 --> 49:21.833
-Different from the US.
-So these things are hard to understand.

49:21.916 --> 49:23.416
Korean culture, right?

49:23.500 --> 49:27.208
So then I'd say
some negative things, you know?

49:27.291 --> 49:28.583
Right.

49:28.666 --> 49:32.125
But somebody
found it four, five years later.

49:32.208 --> 49:34.541
-They took a screenshot?
-Yes.

49:34.625 --> 49:36.833
-Then it became--
-When you became famous?

49:36.916 --> 49:38.833
-It was brought up again.
-Right.

49:38.916 --> 49:40.750
That Jay Park hates Koreans.

49:40.833 --> 49:41.833
I had no idea.

49:41.916 --> 49:44.541
That I hate Korean society,
which doesn't make sense

49:44.625 --> 49:47.458
because my parents are Korean

49:47.541 --> 49:49.791
and I can't hate the people.

49:49.875 --> 49:52.583
-I see what you're saying.
-Anyway, it got out of hand.

49:52.666 --> 49:54.833
-I had no idea.
-I was ignorant.

49:54.916 --> 49:57.500
I made a thoughtless comment
because I was young.

49:57.583 --> 50:01.208
Then, I wanted everyone

50:01.291 --> 50:05.875
to cater to the way
I had lived up until then.

50:05.958 --> 50:08.375
But that was me being greedy and selfish.

50:08.458 --> 50:12.583
I had only lived
in that one small town in the US

50:12.666 --> 50:14.583
and I couldn't understand that back then.

50:14.666 --> 50:17.791
So that became a huge issue.

50:17.875 --> 50:20.333
He talks wisely now. Where'd you grow up?

50:20.416 --> 50:22.916
-Seattle.
-Seattle's not a small town.

50:24.166 --> 50:26.708
It is if you look at the entire planet.

50:26.791 --> 50:28.375
That's all I knew.

50:28.458 --> 50:30.083
This is what makes him so mature.

50:30.166 --> 50:31.666
It's a difficult subject.

50:31.750 --> 50:33.833
I forget you, too, are an adult. Sorry.

50:33.916 --> 50:36.583
-No worries.
-Seattle makes you sleepless, right?

50:36.666 --> 50:38.958
That's right.

50:39.041 --> 50:41.291
-And it rains a lot.
-And the time difference.

50:44.916 --> 50:46.375
Drinking…

50:47.583 --> 50:51.125
Drinking really does work wonders.

50:51.708 --> 50:53.208
I makes you open up.

51:31.458 --> 51:38.375
SUNDAE, BUDAEJJIGAE, CHICKEN
DDUKBOKKI, PIG FEET, KIMCHI

51:59.958 --> 52:02.625
Years after that, I became an AOMG artist

52:02.708 --> 52:05.291
and there was a time
I got criticized for some time.

52:05.375 --> 52:07.375
So I would talk to people at work.

52:07.458 --> 52:09.500
-You were criticized too?
-Yes, me.

52:09.583 --> 52:11.833
I'd vent to them.

52:11.916 --> 52:13.833
Then someone told me.

52:13.916 --> 52:17.750
"If this is stressing you out,
then Jay shouldn't even be alive."

52:18.625 --> 52:20.833
-In other words, it's nothing.
-Yes.

52:20.916 --> 52:25.500
So I thought about what he went through
and my issue really was nothing.

52:26.583 --> 52:30.041
But even if we were the same person
and the same things happened,

52:30.125 --> 52:32.833
it could've been ten times harder for you

52:32.916 --> 52:35.916
because we're different people.

52:37.125 --> 52:38.583
But in any case,

52:38.666 --> 52:41.708
-I think we are very blessed.
-Right.

52:41.791 --> 52:45.458
Because there are many people
who have it worse than us.

52:45.541 --> 52:47.291
We are grateful. We're lucky.

52:50.041 --> 52:52.333
-I need to use the restroom.
-Me too.

52:52.416 --> 52:54.166
I was wondering who'd be the first.

52:59.750 --> 53:01.000
It's nice to be buzzed.

53:02.333 --> 53:05.583
It's been a while
since I last drank at a samgyeopsal place.

53:10.291 --> 53:12.458
-You all right? Aren't you tired?
-I'm fine.

53:13.458 --> 53:14.750
Did you cook the skin once?

53:14.833 --> 53:15.875
-Boiled?
-Grilled once.

53:15.958 --> 53:16.916
I see.

53:17.416 --> 53:18.416
Without boiling it?

53:18.500 --> 53:20.166
Nope, we didn't boil it.

53:24.791 --> 53:26.333
Do you press it down on purpose?

53:26.416 --> 53:28.208
-In case it splatters?
-I see.

53:29.916 --> 53:30.916
That's science.

53:49.250 --> 53:51.208
Take better care of your health.

53:51.708 --> 53:53.708
That's always my concern.

53:53.791 --> 53:55.458
I know you'll do fine, but still.

53:56.333 --> 53:57.500
I feel fine these days.

53:58.875 --> 54:00.500
I can't drink like I used to.

54:01.083 --> 54:03.250
It's not the alcohol.
You're mentally tired.

54:03.333 --> 54:04.750
A lot to stress about.

54:04.833 --> 54:05.958
I'm not stressed.

54:06.666 --> 54:08.750
-It's fun.
-But it's exhausting.

54:11.500 --> 54:13.583
You have it harder, managing the company.

54:14.375 --> 54:17.500
I just do my part.

54:19.416 --> 54:21.083
-Thank you.
-No problem.

54:35.291 --> 54:36.416
Isn't he so mature?

54:36.500 --> 54:38.791
Especially for his age.

54:41.666 --> 54:43.583
I was surprised when I first met Jay.

54:43.666 --> 54:45.500
That's why I asked you earlier.

54:46.000 --> 54:49.875
I know you rarely meet people
outside of work.

54:51.416 --> 54:52.875
He's very mature.

55:02.166 --> 55:04.416
Even for him,

55:04.500 --> 55:07.625
I'm sure being here has helped him grow.

55:07.708 --> 55:10.583
Meeting people,
growing comfortable around them.

55:14.083 --> 55:16.750
I gotta say,
he's done a good job growing up.

55:18.666 --> 55:20.916
-I was pleasantly surprised.
-Yeah.

55:26.000 --> 55:28.333
As we used to say,
if you want to know someone,

55:28.416 --> 55:30.916
you drink with them.

55:31.666 --> 55:32.875
He never makes mistakes.

55:34.250 --> 55:36.333
Neither do you.

55:36.416 --> 55:39.000
You throw up. You know when to stop.

55:39.583 --> 55:41.416
You drink your share, and that's it.

55:43.458 --> 55:44.458
Between us

55:45.541 --> 55:47.000
I'm the one to make mistakes.

55:47.083 --> 55:48.958
I thought people like us were rare.

55:49.041 --> 55:51.708
-But young people are different now.
-Right.

55:54.916 --> 55:56.458
The world changes so quickly.

55:56.958 --> 55:57.916
Aren't you cold?

55:58.000 --> 56:00.416
-Not at all.
-Not now. It should feel good.

56:01.666 --> 56:03.583
-I never imagined…
-What?

56:03.666 --> 56:05.250
…that we could--

56:05.333 --> 56:06.875
Drink with these guys?

56:06.958 --> 56:09.083
Especially considering the age difference.

56:09.166 --> 56:10.458
What's our age gap?

56:10.541 --> 56:12.583
-21 years?
-You're right.

56:18.291 --> 56:23.083
Have you ever had a candid conversation
about your friendship

56:23.166 --> 56:27.291
and how much you appreciate each other?

56:27.375 --> 56:28.916
-This kind of talk?
-No.

56:29.000 --> 56:30.000
Never.

56:30.083 --> 56:32.833
Our generation is worse.
But we do have this.

56:32.916 --> 56:35.333
When we get buzzed, like Jay was saying,

56:35.416 --> 56:38.416
you are no longer embarrassed
so you start saying stuff.

56:38.500 --> 56:40.166
"You gave me your trust."

56:40.250 --> 56:42.250
"You helped me unconditionally."

56:42.333 --> 56:44.375
-When else do you say that?
-Right.

56:44.458 --> 56:47.750
With a bit of help from alcohol,
you can say things like that.

56:47.833 --> 56:51.166
The funny thing
is that if you say these things,

56:51.250 --> 56:53.458
you think you'd forget
'cause you were drunk.

56:53.541 --> 56:55.000
But it gets saved right here.

56:56.000 --> 56:57.625
That's a good effect.

56:57.708 --> 57:01.000
Just so you know, I made a move on my wife
when we were drunk.

57:03.333 --> 57:05.541
Men and women are the same. What's that?

57:05.625 --> 57:08.291
-It means we get it.
-It's sort of a sign.

57:08.375 --> 57:11.708
-I thought it meant third round.
-It means, "Wow, that's cool."

57:12.416 --> 57:14.083
Third round is a must when drinking.

57:14.833 --> 57:15.833
That's how you see it?

57:18.041 --> 57:21.375
But seriously, drinking is good
if you drink wisely.

57:21.458 --> 57:22.333
Totally.

57:22.416 --> 57:25.333
I always say this,
but we should age gracefully.

57:25.416 --> 57:27.041
What else, right?

57:27.125 --> 57:29.041
You guys can't relate yet,

57:29.125 --> 57:32.625
but we both want to age gracefully.

57:32.708 --> 57:34.916
Reminiscing about good memories.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.041
It's like drinking.

57:37.125 --> 57:39.458
We are drinking buddies.
All old friends are.

57:39.541 --> 57:42.208
We want to enjoy a drink
and live a fun life.

57:42.291 --> 57:43.166
It's not easy.

57:43.250 --> 57:44.958
-Let's go. Spirit!
-Okay.

58:21.375 --> 58:24.875
It's my mother's birthday this Friday.
She's turning 60.

58:24.958 --> 58:26.750
-Oh really?
-Yes.

58:26.833 --> 58:29.125
So I wanted to make miyeokguk for her.

58:29.208 --> 58:30.791
Do you know how to make it?

58:31.375 --> 58:33.083
-I made it for her before.
-Oh really?

58:33.166 --> 58:38.833
More importantly
I was hoping I could get your recipe.

58:38.916 --> 58:42.375
-That's what I wanted to make.
-A recipe from the man himself.

58:42.458 --> 58:44.958
-Are you going to use meat?
-Yes, beef.

58:45.041 --> 58:46.666
This Friday?

58:46.750 --> 58:48.625
I'm not sure if I have a shoot.

58:48.708 --> 58:51.625
-If not, I'd make it myself.
-Oh no.

58:52.125 --> 58:54.000
I'm not just saying 'cause I'm drunk.

58:54.666 --> 58:56.541
I'll make it for you on Thursday.

58:57.291 --> 58:59.625
-Wouldn't it be better for him to make it?
-No, it's okay.

59:01.666 --> 59:02.541
Lucky you.

59:02.625 --> 59:03.708
I'll remember.

59:03.791 --> 59:07.041
-It's not a big deal.
-I'll remember later.

59:08.708 --> 59:10.000
How should I contact you?

59:10.083 --> 59:12.416
-Let's see.
-Give me your number.

59:13.583 --> 59:16.250
-Call me. Zero-one-zero.
-Okay.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.541
"This is Loco. Wednesday, miyeokguk."

59:26.625 --> 59:28.833
-Okay.
-"Mother's birthday."
