01:01.084 --> 01:03.051
Hey, Cora. What's up?

01:03.053 --> 01:04.252
What's up, Cora?

01:07.991 --> 01:10.258
You look fantastic.

01:10.260 --> 01:13.728
No. You look electric.
Electrifying.

01:13.730 --> 01:16.965
You look absolutely
electrifying.

01:54.804 --> 01:56.270
Rats.

02:09.285 --> 02:12.054
What's up, Cora?

02:23.666 --> 02:25.933
Kat, please tell me
you're not incarcerated.

02:25.935 --> 02:29.304
Not yet, but it's
a distinct possibility.

02:29.306 --> 02:31.706
The lifeguard's still here.

02:31.708 --> 02:34.610
And there's a stupid
"no bands" sign.

02:34.612 --> 02:37.079
- <i>Oh, no. Disaster.</i>
- Mission abort?

02:37.081 --> 02:39.181
This is a finely tuned
precision operation.

02:39.183 --> 02:40.414
No abortion.

02:40.416 --> 02:42.084
<i>Distract them with
your feminine charms, dude.</i>

02:42.086 --> 02:44.986
Oh, god.
Even his muscles have muscles.

02:44.988 --> 02:46.788
<i>All right, I've got to go
pick up Cora.</i>

02:46.790 --> 02:48.390
I believe in you, Kat.

02:57.900 --> 02:59.367
I'll text you in, like, an hour.

02:59.369 --> 03:01.937
Stop being so mean.

03:01.939 --> 03:02.804
Cora!

03:02.806 --> 03:06.707
Wow! You look
absolutely electrifying.

03:06.709 --> 03:08.377
Oh, god. Do you mean my hair?

03:08.379 --> 03:09.910
I usually blow it out,

03:09.912 --> 03:12.080
but I just could not
be bothered tonight.

03:12.082 --> 03:16.183
Oh, well, you look great.
Natural curls.

03:16.185 --> 03:20.989
I mean, you electrify the atoms
and neutrinos, like, between us.

03:20.991 --> 03:23.991
Like, I can feel it
across time and space.

03:23.993 --> 03:27.361
You just give everything
a positive charge.

03:27.363 --> 03:29.296
- Are you rolling.
- What?

03:29.298 --> 03:30.799
- Are you on Molly?
- Oh.

03:30.801 --> 03:32.134
I want some.

03:32.136 --> 03:34.102
Um, no, no.

03:34.104 --> 03:37.806
I'm on a natural high
just from being with you.

03:39.208 --> 03:41.009
Um...

03:48.017 --> 03:49.986
Thanks.

03:56.025 --> 03:58.092
Help, help!

03:58.094 --> 04:02.164
Help! Help!

04:02.166 --> 04:04.265
Help! Help!

04:12.475 --> 04:14.475
Okay, okay, cough it out.
There you go.

04:14.477 --> 04:16.311
Cough it out. Okay.

04:16.313 --> 04:18.947
- Oh, my god.
- There you go.

04:26.323 --> 04:28.757
Take a deep, breathe.

04:28.759 --> 04:32.394
How many fingers
am I holding up?

04:32.396 --> 04:34.699
Eight.

04:38.035 --> 04:41.037
All right, let's see
if you can try and stand up.

04:42.239 --> 04:43.872
Want me to call your parents
or something?

04:43.874 --> 04:46.208
No, no, I'm good, thank you.

04:46.210 --> 04:48.112
Thanks for the rescue.

04:50.314 --> 04:52.146
Are there dolphins in Malibu?

04:52.148 --> 04:53.148
Yes.

04:53.150 --> 04:55.750
- Dolphins are my spirit animal.
- Oh, really,

04:55.752 --> 04:57.151
- mm-hmm.
- Mine's an aardvark.

04:57.153 --> 04:59.053
Do they eat ants?

04:59.055 --> 05:00.855
And stop.

05:00.857 --> 05:04.091
All right.
I'm going to blindfold.

05:04.093 --> 05:06.995
Dude, uh, I mean,
I'm usually down, but, um...

05:06.997 --> 05:09.964
Oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no,
this isn't a sexy thing.

05:09.966 --> 05:11.833
It's a surprise, I promise.
Okay?

05:11.835 --> 05:14.069
I just need to strap this
on you.

05:14.071 --> 05:17.338
And yelp if it gets too tight.

05:17.340 --> 05:18.507
- Aah!
- Oh.

05:18.509 --> 05:21.278
- I'm kidding.
- Oh. Okay.

05:22.980 --> 05:25.781
We're almost there, okay?

05:25.783 --> 05:27.516
Really close.

05:27.518 --> 05:29.417
I'm so excited.

05:29.419 --> 05:30.918
Oh, me too.

05:30.920 --> 05:33.321
All right, so, okay,
step right here.

05:33.323 --> 05:35.223
You can take
your blindfold off now.

05:42.965 --> 05:45.834
Oh, my god!

05:45.836 --> 05:48.235
Oh, cy!

05:48.237 --> 05:49.303
Oh.

05:49.305 --> 05:54.141
Oh, wow! This is a really
great prom-posal, dude.

05:54.143 --> 05:58.547
Oh, wow, i'm... I'm flattered.
I really am.

05:58.549 --> 06:00.415
But?

06:08.826 --> 06:10.927
Oh, okay.

06:12.429 --> 06:16.096
When I imagine my perfect,
magical prom night

06:16.098 --> 06:17.932
a night that
I'm going to remember

06:17.934 --> 06:21.202
for the rest of my life,
I just...

06:21.204 --> 06:24.305
I just can't imagine
you going down on me.

06:24.307 --> 06:27.209
It's a special night.

06:27.211 --> 06:31.348
And I've just always imagined
it ending with lady head.

06:33.182 --> 06:34.583
I mean, we wouldn't have to...

06:34.585 --> 06:36.151
Oh, no, it'd have to.

06:36.153 --> 06:38.452
It's a very important part
of my prom fantasy.

06:38.454 --> 06:40.021
I'm sorry.

06:40.023 --> 06:42.893
You'll find a girl
that you're right for.

06:45.028 --> 06:47.194
I'll call an uber.

06:58.374 --> 07:00.175
Cy.

07:00.177 --> 07:01.910
What are you doing?
You have to get up.

07:01.912 --> 07:04.144
I'm sick, or whatever excuse

07:04.146 --> 07:06.047
seems the most believable.

07:06.049 --> 07:08.617
You think it's terminal?

07:08.619 --> 07:11.452
Hey. You masturbating?

07:11.454 --> 07:13.487
Oh, god, no.

07:13.489 --> 07:15.055
Leave him alone.

07:15.057 --> 07:16.958
I don't think his date
went very well.

07:16.960 --> 07:20.961
Oh, women, huh? Yeah. Gotta say.

07:20.963 --> 07:22.497
You know what I don't
understand?

07:22.499 --> 07:25.901
Is how could someone not fall,
like, totally head over heels,

07:25.903 --> 07:28.435
like, madly in love
with my extraordinary,

07:28.437 --> 07:30.906
handsome, amazing, smart son?

07:30.908 --> 07:32.339
She said she couldn't go with me

07:32.341 --> 07:35.910
because she couldn't imagine me
going down on her.

07:35.912 --> 07:38.312
Ah. Well, is, uh...

07:38.314 --> 07:41.016
Is oral sex
this year's prom theme?

07:44.453 --> 07:46.254
Oh, come on, come on!

07:46.256 --> 07:48.490
You have to admit
it's a very important aspect

07:48.492 --> 07:49.658
- of lovemaking.
- Mom!

07:49.660 --> 07:51.526
I mean, it's true. It really is.

07:51.528 --> 07:53.627
What? What, are you gonna
be all puritan on me?

07:53.629 --> 07:55.129
I mean, my gosh, grow a pair

07:55.131 --> 07:56.997
so we can actually
converse like adults.

07:56.999 --> 07:58.333
Right?

07:58.335 --> 08:00.701
And enjoy talking about
the very important act

08:00.703 --> 08:02.536
of just human sexuality.

08:02.538 --> 08:04.139
What? I mean, honestly, sweetie,

08:04.141 --> 08:07.042
if I could not appreciate
that actual experience with you,

08:07.044 --> 08:09.410
I don't know what I would do.

08:09.412 --> 08:12.413
- Oh, god. Make its stop.
- Cy, look at me.

08:12.415 --> 08:15.417
You are the most
interesting, kind,

08:15.419 --> 08:17.351
caring kid
I've ever given birth to.

08:17.353 --> 08:19.420
And if she can't see that,
well, then she's a total idiot.

08:19.422 --> 08:21.523
Well, I'm the <i>only</i> kid
you've ever given birth to.

08:21.525 --> 08:24.192
All right. Don't mince words
with me, young man.

08:24.194 --> 08:25.526
- Hey!
- Oh, yeah.

08:25.528 --> 08:28.295
- Speaking of smarty pants...
- Good morning!

08:28.297 --> 08:30.165
- Open it already!
- Yeah, I will, I will.

08:30.167 --> 08:31.432
- Come on.
- All right.

08:31.434 --> 08:33.434
- Read it, read it.
- All right, all right.

08:33.436 --> 08:35.556
Well, I mean, it just says
that I've gotten all "a" s.

08:38.275 --> 08:40.442
Oh, no, no! Oh, god.

08:40.444 --> 08:42.409
Okay, okay.

08:42.411 --> 08:44.312
- We're so proud of you.
- Thanks.

08:44.314 --> 08:45.178
Mwah!

08:45.180 --> 08:48.182
So, you know how, like,
you said that

08:48.184 --> 08:51.019
if I got straight "a" s, you'd
get me anything I wanted, right?

08:51.021 --> 08:52.687
Yeah. Not, like, a pony,
but yeah.

08:52.689 --> 08:54.188
It's not a pony.

08:54.190 --> 08:55.724
Well, 'cause, like,
I have been, like,

08:55.726 --> 08:57.392
putting thought into this.

08:57.394 --> 09:00.028
Like, I'm spending hours and
hours contemplating what I want.

09:00.030 --> 09:02.529
And I... well...

09:02.531 --> 09:04.334
This is what I want.

09:07.069 --> 09:09.070
I'd have to do a few procedures
first and then...

09:09.072 --> 09:12.240
- What is it, cosmetic surgery?
- Why would you want to do this?

09:12.242 --> 09:14.542
Why do you think?
It's 'cause I'm hideous.

09:14.544 --> 09:17.479
- What are you talking about?
- I'm disgusting.

09:17.481 --> 09:20.414
Honey, you are just
extraordinary and amazing.

09:20.416 --> 09:22.283
What are... what...
I don't understand.

09:22.285 --> 09:23.618
- You're so unique. I don't...
- This doesn't make any sense.

09:23.620 --> 09:25.787
Look at me. My mouth is
too small for my face,

09:25.789 --> 09:27.187
and nostrils are asymmetrical.

09:27.189 --> 09:30.325
I've got one eye that's, like,
<i>way</i> bigger than the other.

09:30.327 --> 09:33.094
- My face is ugly.
- This is not happening. No.

09:33.096 --> 09:34.796
No, absolutely not.

09:34.798 --> 09:37.432
- Wait.
- No. No!

09:37.434 --> 09:40.134
All right, it's Kat.
I've got to get dressed.

09:40.136 --> 09:42.736
Can you please...?

09:42.738 --> 09:44.339
He gets this from you, you know.

09:44.341 --> 09:46.374
No, I think he gets it from
the anonymous donor...

09:46.376 --> 09:48.043
It's always the anonymous donor.

09:48.045 --> 09:49.644
- Please, please.
- It's not your perfectionism.

09:49.646 --> 09:51.578
Please tell Kat I said hello.
This is crazy.

09:51.580 --> 09:53.248
All right, I will.

09:53.250 --> 09:55.450
And don't ever show me that
or go to that place again.

09:55.452 --> 09:58.052
- Hurry up.
- Can you please close the door?

09:58.054 --> 10:00.587
No.

10:00.589 --> 10:02.389
You're gonna be fine!

10:02.391 --> 10:06.126
You kinda just turned her into
this, like, sexy,

10:06.128 --> 10:07.562
unattainable archetype.

10:07.564 --> 10:09.697
I loved her.

10:09.699 --> 10:12.667
No. No, you didn't.

10:12.669 --> 10:14.201
She's dead to me now.

10:14.203 --> 10:16.607
But you didn't even know her.

10:18.809 --> 10:21.676
I feel like my organs are being
ripped through my orifices.

10:21.678 --> 10:24.245
No, the small ones,

10:24.247 --> 10:26.413
- like my urethra.
- Oh, gross!

10:26.415 --> 10:29.317
Yeah, no, that's how I feel
right now.

10:29.319 --> 10:31.852
Okay, well, I need your lungs
to help me practice

10:31.854 --> 10:35.423
for my audition, so let's go.

10:36.525 --> 10:39.293
It doesn't matter how lazy,

10:39.295 --> 10:41.495
stupid, or uncultured you are.

10:41.497 --> 10:43.498
It's like, if you have
a pretty face,

10:43.500 --> 10:45.501
people love you.

10:47.103 --> 10:50.406
For example... Chris Newton.

10:52.309 --> 10:54.741
Hiya!

10:54.743 --> 10:56.711
- Wat-sa!
- Good, good.

10:56.713 --> 10:59.114
Just make sure you get my
tricep on this one.

10:59.116 --> 11:01.482
Yeah, I see it. It's divine.

11:14.463 --> 11:16.563
Hiya!

11:21.804 --> 11:24.672
He's so dreamy.

11:24.674 --> 11:26.543
I'd do him.

11:28.678 --> 11:31.211
Oh, my god!
That was totally tourettic.

11:31.213 --> 11:32.813
- You meant that.
- No, no, no.

11:32.815 --> 11:35.283
Only my deepest reptilian brain.

11:35.285 --> 11:38.387
Your reptilian brain
is disgusting.

11:39.455 --> 11:42.222
Wait. Oh, my god. You're jelly!

11:42.224 --> 11:44.192
What? No, I'm not. That's
preposterous.

11:44.194 --> 11:45.759
- Yeah, you are.
- Ah!

11:45.761 --> 11:48.328
You're the boner dude
that Cora Davidson said

11:48.330 --> 11:49.596
that she would puke
if he ate her peach.

11:49.598 --> 11:52.634
What? Peach?
Wait. She didn't say that.

11:52.636 --> 11:54.635
Rad boner, though, dude.

11:54.637 --> 11:57.705
Ow.

12:00.544 --> 12:02.342
- Oh, cy.
- What?

12:02.344 --> 12:05.746
<i>When I imagine my perfect
magical prom night,</i>

12:05.748 --> 12:07.782
<i>a night that
I'm going to remember</i>

12:07.784 --> 12:09.384
<i>for the rest of my life,</i>

12:09.386 --> 12:11.852
<i>I just can't imagine
you going down on me.</i>

12:11.854 --> 12:15.389
<i>- I mean, we wouldn't have to...
- Oh, no, it'd have to.</i>

12:15.391 --> 12:18.393
What asshole troll posted this?

12:18.395 --> 12:20.564
<i>You'll find a girl that...</i>

12:23.466 --> 12:26.734
Well, it's kind of
an in-involuntary reflex, right?

12:26.736 --> 12:29.303
I mean, you can't control
what pops up.

12:31.540 --> 12:33.640
Well, I-I don't think you have
anything to be ashamed of.

12:33.642 --> 12:37.245
I mean, it's just, um, I don't
have that much experience

12:37.247 --> 12:38.679
with, like...

12:40.583 --> 12:43.384
Or any experience at all,
but I don't...

12:43.386 --> 12:45.452
You know, I-I wouldn't
feel bad about it.

12:45.454 --> 12:46.955
This is a glitch in the matrix.

12:46.957 --> 12:49.490
- Boner boy!
- Oh, my god. I'm in hell.

12:49.492 --> 12:52.527
I feel like I'm gonna
puke up my entire soul.

12:52.529 --> 12:55.230
Your <i>entire</i> soul?

12:55.232 --> 12:56.496
Wah-hiya!

12:56.498 --> 12:57.966
Dude, it's the fuckin'
boner dude.

12:57.968 --> 13:01.469
Dude, kick his ass.
Right now. Go! Go!

13:01.471 --> 13:04.605
- Hiya!
- Oh! Oh, you got... oh!

13:04.607 --> 13:07.609
Oh, shit. What the hell?
You asshole.

13:07.611 --> 13:09.610
Motherfucker! Oh!

13:09.612 --> 13:11.745
Hey, get off me!
What are you doing?

13:11.747 --> 13:13.248
Oh!

13:13.250 --> 13:15.515
- You're the king!
- We're dancing!

13:15.517 --> 13:17.784
Yeah! Post it, bro!

13:17.786 --> 13:21.288
So, can you stop acting
like an effing idiot, please?

13:21.290 --> 13:24.325
Thank you. Just, you know,
up your medication

13:24.327 --> 13:26.561
do pilates, or something.
I don't know.

13:26.563 --> 13:28.830
Have a lovely time in detention.

13:28.832 --> 13:30.597
And you, Mr. Newton,

13:30.599 --> 13:33.634
what's with your stupid
karate-chopping videos?

13:33.636 --> 13:35.903
Hiya!

13:35.905 --> 13:38.605
Bro, if I would have
gotten suspended,

13:38.607 --> 13:40.008
my mom would have lost her shit.

13:40.010 --> 13:42.476
Yeah, sorry,
I kinda lost my shit.

13:42.478 --> 13:43.977
Dude, you got anger issues, man.

13:43.979 --> 13:46.380
- You need to check that shit out.
- Yeah. How about you try getting

13:46.382 --> 13:48.316
a video of you passed around
around you getting

13:48.318 --> 13:50.317
royally dissed
while having an erection?

13:50.319 --> 13:52.787
That's no big deal, bro.
Rock the sconge.

13:52.789 --> 13:55.289
- Sconge?
- Yeah.

13:55.291 --> 13:57.725
- Boner town, bro.
- Geez, man.

14:00.497 --> 14:02.629
Well, gotta fly, cy.

14:02.631 --> 14:05.633
Oh, shit! Fly, cy.

14:05.635 --> 14:07.902
He sees the girls,
the pee-pee gets high.

14:27.957 --> 14:30.390
- I saw your video.
- Okay, it's not <i>mine.</i>

14:30.392 --> 14:32.826
And, also, why do people think
it's, like,

14:32.828 --> 14:34.828
okay to come up to me
and tell me that they've seen

14:34.830 --> 14:37.030
something super private
and totally mortifying?

14:37.032 --> 14:41.469
And, also, it's just
a stupid erection, okay?

14:41.471 --> 14:43.937
Like, so, come on.
Who doesn't get one?

14:43.939 --> 14:46.443
Shh!

14:48.344 --> 14:51.812
I-I don't... get them.

14:51.814 --> 14:54.014
I mean, I guess there's, like,
such thing as a lady boner,

14:54.016 --> 14:55.584
but...

14:57.520 --> 15:01.022
I'm sorry. It's been a long day.

15:01.024 --> 15:02.823
I'm cy.

15:02.825 --> 15:04.991
I'm roxy, and I'm sorry,

15:04.993 --> 15:07.861
I probably came off
like such a dick just now.

15:07.863 --> 15:09.897
You're new, right?

15:09.899 --> 15:11.966
It's my first day.

15:11.968 --> 15:14.701
Wow. Super auspicious start.

15:14.703 --> 15:18.105
Nice job lending in detention
on day one.

15:18.107 --> 15:19.974
Seriously, you're my hero.

15:19.976 --> 15:23.644
Oh, well, I saw you
jump on that gorilla.

15:23.646 --> 15:25.113
Why did they threw you in here?

15:25.115 --> 15:29.082
I was ranting about "1984"
being an inherently sexist text.

15:29.084 --> 15:32.019
I guess that
that was, uh, disruptive.

15:32.021 --> 15:34.121
So they tossed me in this gulag.

15:34.123 --> 15:36.456
"1984" is sexist?

15:36.458 --> 15:38.594
Yeah. Look.

15:39.828 --> 15:41.662
You ready?

15:41.664 --> 15:43.730
"The improvement in
her appearance was startling.

15:43.732 --> 15:45.799
With just a few dabs of color
in the right places,

15:45.801 --> 15:48.403
she'd become not only
very much prettier,

15:48.405 --> 15:51.105
but above all,
far more feminine."

15:51.107 --> 15:52.740
He's saying that
we need capitalism

15:52.742 --> 15:55.109
because it allows,
even encourages, women

15:55.111 --> 15:58.078
to paint their faces
to be more desirable to men.

15:58.080 --> 16:02.417
In fact, like, he's saying that
that's what makes them women.

16:02.419 --> 16:04.051
It's a great book in many ways.

16:04.053 --> 16:08.623
But let's just be conscious
of inherent gender bias.

16:08.625 --> 16:10.892
- Wow.
- <i>When I imagine...</i>

16:12.996 --> 16:16.197
Cy, this really sucks.

16:16.199 --> 16:17.631
Do you realize
this is gonna be on here

16:17.633 --> 16:19.769
until the Internet breaks?

16:22.171 --> 16:26.974
It's up to, um, 232,000.

16:26.976 --> 16:29.943
<i>You'll find a girl
that you're right for.</i>

16:39.655 --> 16:41.589
What are you still doing here?

16:41.591 --> 16:43.124
Oh, well, it's always
so depressing

16:43.126 --> 16:44.524
when you get released from jail

16:44.526 --> 16:45.927
and, like, no one's there
to meet you.

16:45.929 --> 16:49.230
- Mm.
- I hate that.

16:49.232 --> 16:51.731
Hi. I, uh...

16:51.733 --> 16:55.536
You guys are so, like...
Like the...

16:55.538 --> 16:57.672
I am roxy. Hi. Nice to meet you.

16:57.674 --> 16:59.807
Oh, hi. Yes, I am Kat.

16:59.809 --> 17:01.576
- I like what you're wearing.
- I like your skirt.

17:01.578 --> 17:02.876
- Oh, thank you. I...
- Jinx.

17:02.878 --> 17:06.113
- I made it myself.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

17:06.115 --> 17:08.082
- I made this, too.
- Ah!

17:08.084 --> 17:09.784
Yeah.

17:09.786 --> 17:12.823
All my clothes are made
by Bangladeshi children.

17:15.157 --> 17:16.857
- Okay.
- That was... all right.

17:16.859 --> 17:18.226
- Um...
- I'll see you guys later.

17:18.228 --> 17:20.494
- It was nice to meet you.
- Yeah. Here.

17:20.496 --> 17:23.263
- My lady.
- Thank you.

17:23.265 --> 17:25.199
Those were for me, but okay.

17:29.771 --> 17:31.672
You could have offered her
a ride.

17:31.674 --> 17:33.641
I'm already enough of a pariah.

17:33.643 --> 17:35.742
I'm not gonna embarrass myself
further.

17:54.998 --> 17:57.934
Ooh! Frosty!

18:00.970 --> 18:03.069
Icy!

18:24.193 --> 18:25.826
Hello.

18:25.828 --> 18:28.663
My magical skateboard
never lets me down.

18:28.665 --> 18:31.031
- Oh.
- Just led me straight to you.

18:31.033 --> 18:32.700
I'm soy Chris, señorita.

18:32.702 --> 18:34.769
Just learned that
in that Spanish class.

18:34.771 --> 18:36.304
Cool.

18:36.306 --> 18:39.740
Um... hiya!

18:39.742 --> 18:41.041
- Right?
- Hmm?

18:41.043 --> 18:42.910
I'm the guy!
I'm the guy from the videos.

18:42.912 --> 18:44.912
- I do the "hiya" videos.
- The... I don't...

18:44.914 --> 18:46.314
You have to have seen
the videos.

18:46.316 --> 18:48.782
- No, I...
- You've never seen the videos?

18:48.784 --> 18:50.351
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

18:50.353 --> 18:52.353
Oh, shit! Oh!

18:52.355 --> 18:55.122
- You okay?
- Yeah, I just hit my face.

18:55.124 --> 18:57.191
I think you might need
to nurse me back to health.

18:57.193 --> 18:58.925
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

18:58.927 --> 19:03.631
Well, um, maybe... maybe your
your comrades could babysit you.

19:03.633 --> 19:07.067
Listen, the only baby here
is you, babe,

19:07.069 --> 19:10.637
as in a, "hey, baby,
you're a babe" way.

19:10.639 --> 19:13.974
- Wow.
- You are a babe.

19:13.976 --> 19:16.076
- Wow. That was, um...
- Smooth?

19:16.078 --> 19:18.746
That was really smooth,
soy Chris, yeah.

19:18.748 --> 19:20.247
What bad '90s song
was that from?

19:20.249 --> 19:22.117
It's not. It's all me.

19:24.953 --> 19:28.122
- What else you got?
- Uh...

19:28.124 --> 19:29.957
I'm a... um...

19:29.959 --> 19:31.858
Yeah, you should expand
your repertoire, dude.

19:31.860 --> 19:33.827
Wh... don't bounce yet,
don't bounce yet.

19:33.829 --> 19:36.196
Okay, give me one reason.

19:36.198 --> 19:38.265
I want to do a 720 gazelle flip
for you. Watch.

19:38.267 --> 19:40.101
Look, Chris, I'm not trying to
be an ass...

19:40.103 --> 19:42.872
Just wait. Just wait.
Watch, watch, watch.

20:03.826 --> 20:05.859
- Wow!
- Whoo!

20:05.861 --> 20:08.028
- Pretty dope, huh?
- That was, um...

20:08.030 --> 20:10.330
- Pretty cool, huh?
- That was really impressive.

20:10.332 --> 20:12.133
You sure you haven't seen
<i>any</i> of my videos?

20:12.135 --> 20:13.867
- I haven't.
- Some of them average

20:13.869 --> 20:16.804
like 250,000 views.
That's like a million people.

20:16.806 --> 20:19.272
That <i>is</i> like a million people.
That's rad, yeah.

20:19.274 --> 20:22.009
- You should probably, um...
- You have to have heard of me!

20:22.011 --> 20:23.376
Re-crunch your numbers,
though, man.

20:23.378 --> 20:25.813
Let me take you out. We could...

20:25.815 --> 20:27.882
I don't know, bowl or some shit.

20:27.884 --> 20:30.317
- "Bowl or some shit"?
- Huh? You bowl?

20:30.319 --> 20:34.355
Um, no.
Look, you seem like a, uh,

20:34.357 --> 20:39.460
a really swell guy,
but I'm just not interested.

20:39.462 --> 20:41.996
- In-interested in me?
- Yes.

20:41.998 --> 20:43.798
Well, what are you
interested in?

20:43.800 --> 20:47.902
Um, art, reading,
women's rights.

20:47.904 --> 20:49.303
I'm actually trying to
get into a good college

20:49.305 --> 20:52.772
so I can make this, like,
a less-shitty planet.

20:52.774 --> 20:54.909
Well, I mean,
I like planets, too.

20:54.911 --> 20:56.777
Like, I don't want
a shitty planet.

20:56.779 --> 20:59.281
Right. I'm...

21:05.454 --> 21:09.125
I spent a summer building houses
in Vietnam for poor people!

21:11.426 --> 21:13.193
Shit.

21:13.195 --> 21:18.201
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit.

21:21.803 --> 21:23.436
She said no, bro.

21:23.438 --> 21:26.339
Damn.

21:26.341 --> 21:27.775
You want to... you want a hug?

21:27.777 --> 21:29.242
No, I don't want a hug!

21:29.244 --> 21:31.479
We're at a skate park, man.

21:31.481 --> 21:34.017
What are you thinking?

21:37.220 --> 21:40.488
All right, fine, bro.

21:40.490 --> 21:42.222
Oh, easy.

24:04.666 --> 24:06.366
- Hiya!
- Aaaah!

24:06.368 --> 24:09.236
Whoa, bro,

24:09.238 --> 24:11.137
I totally shut down
your sexy me time.

24:11.139 --> 24:12.472
- No, you didn't, no, you didn't.
- I did.

24:12.474 --> 24:14.040
Yeah, you got the music going...

24:14.042 --> 24:15.576
- No, no, no, no.
- You go the shirt off.

24:15.578 --> 24:17.944
- I see...
- Hey, boys.

24:17.946 --> 24:19.680
Do you two want some couscous?

24:19.682 --> 24:21.515
No, that's gross, mom.

24:21.517 --> 24:24.518
- Okay, thank you. You can go.
- All right, privacy time.

24:24.520 --> 24:27.153
- Have fun, friends.
- Have fun. Have a great night.

24:27.155 --> 24:28.489
Okay.

24:28.491 --> 24:31.157
Dude, you have two moms?
Those are your moms?

24:31.159 --> 24:33.928
- Yep.
- No way!

24:33.930 --> 24:35.229
I mean, that's...
That's totally fine.

24:35.231 --> 24:36.497
- Like, it's cool.
- Oh, yeah.

24:36.499 --> 24:37.998
I'll tell them that
you're cool with it.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.333
Cool, cool, cool.

24:39.335 --> 24:42.102
Hey, if you don't mind me
asking, who's the man?

24:42.104 --> 24:45.538
There is no man, dumb-ass.
That's the point.

24:45.540 --> 24:49.143
Right, right. Um...

24:49.145 --> 24:52.278
So, you're, like, into, like,
art and culture and stuff?

24:52.280 --> 24:53.346
And stuff.

24:53.348 --> 24:56.150
Think we could go for a walk
or something, man?

24:56.152 --> 24:57.550
I'm getting all twitchy.

24:59.155 --> 25:01.989
Bro, I'm <i>super</i> into her.

25:01.991 --> 25:04.258
She's into art and books
and shit.

25:04.260 --> 25:06.292
- She should date me, then.
- Bingo, dude.

25:06.294 --> 25:08.962
I just have to look like
I'm into art and culture.

25:08.964 --> 25:12.999
So, what if I get a smart, artsy
dude to run my social media

25:13.001 --> 25:14.401
so it looks like I'm down with
that shit?

25:14.403 --> 25:18.038
- You want me to be you online?
- Yes, bro!

25:18.040 --> 25:20.441
You blow her away
with how dope "my" brain is,

25:20.443 --> 25:23.544
I swoop in irl
and seal the deal!

25:23.546 --> 25:26.279
All right? I mean, we both do
what we're gifted at, all right?

25:26.281 --> 25:29.351
You got the brains,
I got the endless charm.

25:33.055 --> 25:35.990
Dude, you've seen
too many movies.

25:35.992 --> 25:38.592
Irl, this kind of thing
never works out.

25:42.030 --> 25:44.565
- What's this?
- My offer.

25:44.567 --> 25:47.067
Why are there so many zeros?

25:47.069 --> 25:49.068
What can I say, bro?

25:49.070 --> 25:51.672
You know what's out there.
Sheer lameness.

25:51.674 --> 25:54.208
Right? They want more.

25:54.210 --> 25:56.576
They're diggin' my hiya.

25:56.578 --> 25:59.480
Wat-sa! Ooh-hoo-hoo!

25:59.482 --> 26:01.080
You weren't ready for that,
were you?

26:01.082 --> 26:03.118
Jesus. Fuck.

26:04.552 --> 26:05.786
Whatever, bro.

26:05.788 --> 26:08.622
Let me know
if you change your mind.

26:13.628 --> 26:16.329
Dude.

26:16.331 --> 26:18.233
Shit!

26:32.615 --> 26:34.681
Oh.

26:38.119 --> 26:40.686
Say hello to your new
digital self.

26:40.688 --> 26:43.624
So, we're gonna do this social
platform by social platform.

26:43.626 --> 26:47.326
By the time we're done,
roxy is gonna be all over you.

26:47.328 --> 26:49.395
- Hoo-hoo! Make my nerdy, daddy.
- All right.

26:49.397 --> 26:52.132
So, first, we're gonna
have you follow people

26:52.134 --> 26:53.599
who make you look smart.

26:53.601 --> 26:55.169
Who do you follow right now?

26:55.171 --> 26:57.438
Rob gronkowski, kanye,

26:57.440 --> 27:00.240
Bruce Lee, for obvious reasons.

27:00.242 --> 27:02.409
Wat-sa!

27:02.411 --> 27:05.345
Um, my bros
and my little sister.

27:05.347 --> 27:07.448
She's super woke
for being 6, bro.

27:07.450 --> 27:10.550
Okay, from now on,
we'll have you follow

27:10.552 --> 27:13.820
scientists
like Neil degrasse Tyson,

27:13.822 --> 27:16.423
Stephen Hawking, Jane goodall,

27:16.425 --> 27:20.426
philosophers and activists
like cornel west, slavoj zizek,

27:20.428 --> 27:24.163
and, um, Lena Dunham
for some third-wave feminism.

27:24.165 --> 27:25.566
- Ugh!
- I'm sorry.

27:25.568 --> 27:27.835
You'll also be following
celebrated writers

27:27.837 --> 27:30.336
like Joan didion, Roxane gay.

27:30.338 --> 27:32.506
You said "gay," bro.

27:32.508 --> 27:34.610
Ooh!

27:36.479 --> 27:38.612
Oh.

27:38.614 --> 27:41.882
"The noblest pleasure
is the joy of understanding."

27:41.884 --> 27:44.117
Leonardo da Vinci.

27:44.119 --> 27:45.384
Damn, bro.

27:45.386 --> 27:48.689
And that's why I won the Oscar.

27:48.691 --> 27:51.422
All right, let's post a pic
of you at an exhibit

27:51.424 --> 27:52.558
- at an art museum, all right?
- Let's do it, bro.

27:52.560 --> 27:55.328
You're high-tech, brah.

27:55.330 --> 27:58.464
Hey, that Vietnam thing I did...
I actually did that, so...

27:58.466 --> 28:01.103
- Smile.
- Okay.

28:02.338 --> 28:04.438
How's the bicep, bro?

28:04.440 --> 28:06.507
Shadows?

28:06.509 --> 28:08.342
- Huh?
- Mm-hmm.

28:08.344 --> 28:12.346
All right, now let's
put you in the louvre.

28:12.348 --> 28:13.680
- Okay.
- Looking at art.

28:13.682 --> 28:15.548
Looking at the "Mona Lisa."

28:15.550 --> 28:17.217
Ah! Check it out!

28:17.219 --> 28:19.286
You're in the uffizi gallerie
now.

28:19.288 --> 28:21.454
Yep, that's a real uffizi face.

28:21.456 --> 28:24.525
All right, let me see, dude.

28:24.527 --> 28:27.161
No, no, no, no.
Dude, we gotta do these again.

28:27.163 --> 28:29.829
Look at my chin. Higher angles.

28:29.831 --> 28:31.365
Okay, all right.
Okay. All right.

28:31.367 --> 28:32.900
- All right. All right.
- All right, all right.

28:32.902 --> 28:35.501
All right.

28:37.740 --> 28:40.440
- Do you need to get that?
- Yeah, dude, hold on. Sorry.

28:40.442 --> 28:42.942
Ugh.

28:42.944 --> 28:44.944
- Yo!
- Bro.

28:44.946 --> 28:47.247
What about "ttyl"
do you not get?

28:47.249 --> 28:48.515
I just though
we could go to the beach,

28:48.517 --> 28:50.784
get some savage shots
of us surfing!

28:50.786 --> 28:52.251
Smack the lip. Wa-pah!

28:52.253 --> 28:54.288
Dude, I can't be myself
anymore, all right?

28:54.290 --> 28:56.522
I told you...
I'm gotta be a kook now.

28:56.524 --> 28:57.891
Yeah, but I just thought
that we...

28:57.893 --> 28:59.358
Don't be thirsty!

28:59.360 --> 29:01.194
All right? It looks bad.

29:01.196 --> 29:07.800
And I ran out of my deodorant,
so can you get me my regular?

29:07.802 --> 29:10.403
Thanks, bro.

29:10.405 --> 29:13.240
Sorry, bro.
Are we... are we good here?

29:13.242 --> 29:15.776
Yeah, so any time
you're at a poetry reading

29:15.778 --> 29:18.811
or an art installation,
just take a snap,

29:18.813 --> 29:20.413
and then talk about, like...

29:20.415 --> 29:21.949
Bro, that sounds
like a lot of work.

29:21.951 --> 29:24.851
Well, I mean, you could just
give me your password,

29:24.853 --> 29:26.586
and I can just go myself.

29:26.588 --> 29:28.888
So you can hack me
and steal my identity?

29:28.890 --> 29:30.289
Like what you're
paying me to do?

29:30.291 --> 29:32.759
- No, bro, not happening.
- All right, fine.

29:32.761 --> 29:35.695
Run Snapchat yourself.
Let's talk about Facebook.

29:35.697 --> 29:37.431
Ugh!

29:46.575 --> 29:49.742
All right, no, I can't...
I can't go on.

29:49.744 --> 29:54.280
Chris <i>Newton</i> asked <i>you</i>
to pretend to be him online,

29:54.282 --> 29:56.650
and you're just not concerned?

29:56.652 --> 29:58.551
Well, what should I be
concerned about?

29:58.553 --> 30:00.721
How about he's secretly
involved in a bet

30:00.723 --> 30:02.355
to see if he can make
the nerdy kid popular?

30:02.357 --> 30:04.324
Like that would be
the end of the world?

30:04.326 --> 30:06.460
I mean, it's gonna end
with you onstage,

30:06.462 --> 30:08.028
covered in pig's blood,

30:08.030 --> 30:10.596
just without
the telekinetic powers.

30:10.598 --> 30:13.634
Why am I the female character
in this scenario?

30:13.636 --> 30:15.402
- I don't know.
- Whatever.

30:15.404 --> 30:17.738
Practice, or else you're not
gonna get in,

30:17.740 --> 30:20.007
and instead of carnegie hall,
you'll be an old lady

30:20.009 --> 30:21.942
playing to a house full of cats.

30:21.944 --> 30:24.845
Thanks. That helps.

30:24.847 --> 30:26.980
I'm nervous!

30:26.982 --> 30:29.615
Look, you'll be fine.
Don't worry.

30:29.617 --> 30:31.451
I'll be there.

30:31.453 --> 30:33.487
- Okay.
- Also, like...

30:33.489 --> 30:35.454
Do you really think that
it's impossible

30:35.456 --> 30:36.757
that I may have some traits

30:36.759 --> 30:38.991
that people might be envious of?

30:38.993 --> 30:43.297
Yeah, some people. Sure.

30:43.299 --> 30:45.399
But Chris Newton?

30:45.401 --> 30:47.733
Why would Chris Newton want to
seem more like you?

30:47.735 --> 30:51.337
Because it will help him
get to roxy faster,

30:51.339 --> 30:53.606
'cause apparently
I'm just her type,

30:53.608 --> 30:56.777
except from my head,
face, and body.

30:56.779 --> 31:00.314
Oh, okay, so you're catfishing
the poor girl.

31:00.316 --> 31:01.815
Uh, no, I wouldn't call it that.

31:01.817 --> 31:03.583
Oh, really?
I would call it that,

31:03.585 --> 31:05.051
'cause that's, like, exactly
what you're doing.

31:05.053 --> 31:06.720
- What? No.
- Okay, you know what?

31:06.722 --> 31:09.990
No, I'll put you in your misery
'cause you're suffering.

31:12.394 --> 31:14.060
No! Stop it.

31:14.062 --> 31:17.564
I'm a social media consultant
it's what celebrities have.

31:17.566 --> 31:19.999
Chris is a YouTube celebrity.

31:20.001 --> 31:21.701
Okay, okay.

31:21.703 --> 31:26.006
So I'm a celebrity consultant
online.

31:26.008 --> 31:27.710
Ah.

31:30.044 --> 31:31.944
Ugh.

31:31.946 --> 31:33.646
I'd love to keep wasting time

31:33.648 --> 31:35.715
discussing your bizarre
personal problems,

31:35.717 --> 31:39.521
but it's eating into
my silent disco break.

31:47.096 --> 31:49.829
It's not a silent disco if
there's only one participant.

31:49.831 --> 31:51.733
Oh, sure.

32:03.378 --> 32:05.714
That's how you dance?

32:09.585 --> 32:10.817
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hey, sweetie, what you doing?

32:10.819 --> 32:14.587
- Nothing.
- What you looking at?

32:14.589 --> 32:18.422
- Were you looking at porn?
- What? No.

32:18.424 --> 32:18.759
You know, having a healthy
sexual appetite

32:18.761 --> 32:20.594
is actually awesome.
It's just, if you're gonna

32:20.596 --> 32:22.528
look at porn, you need to be
aware of the exploitation.

32:22.530 --> 32:24.096
I'm gonna send you
some ethical sites.

32:24.098 --> 32:26.599
- Okay, I'm looking at a girl.
- Oh!

32:26.601 --> 32:28.101
- Jesus.
- Oh, my gosh.

32:28.103 --> 32:29.736
She is just drop-dead hot.

32:29.738 --> 32:31.637
- That's really gross, mom.
- No, I'm just noticing.

32:31.639 --> 32:33.606
I mean, look at her.
She's just beautiful.

32:33.608 --> 32:34.907
- Ugh.
- She's so pretty.

32:34.909 --> 32:36.977
- You gonna ask her to prom?
- No, I'm not.

32:36.979 --> 32:38.811
I'm not asking her to prom.

32:38.813 --> 32:41.914
No, she wouldn't go with me.
Not with how I look.

32:41.916 --> 32:43.650
Honey, what are you talking
about?

32:43.652 --> 32:46.153
- That's crazy.
- How do we explain this to you?

32:46.155 --> 32:48.020
- You are perfect.
- Absolutely perfect.

32:48.022 --> 32:50.856
Okay, look, I love you guys,
but that's really hard

32:50.858 --> 32:52.659
to take to heart
coming from my moms.

32:52.661 --> 32:55.028
You know what? For a kid
who's raised by lesbians,

32:55.030 --> 32:57.631
you know startlingly little
about women, okay?

32:57.633 --> 33:00.733
She's a person.
She is a real, live person.

33:00.735 --> 33:02.536
Instead of just thinking
what girls want,

33:02.538 --> 33:04.637
you know, you have to know
what girls... blank.

33:04.639 --> 33:06.705
You have to
learn about this woman.

33:06.707 --> 33:09.843
Can I have my room back now?

33:09.845 --> 33:11.778
- Yes.
- Hmm.

33:35.203 --> 33:36.903
Stop!

33:51.953 --> 33:55.821
Bro, this place smells like
ass cheeks and hot cheetos.

33:55.823 --> 33:57.656
Well, roxy loves this place.
All right?

33:57.658 --> 33:58.959
So let's just get you
on Snapchat

33:58.961 --> 34:01.161
saying something interesting
about the dj.

34:01.163 --> 34:02.962
All right.

34:05.233 --> 34:06.766
Yo, what up, hiyas?

34:06.768 --> 34:08.234
We out here at some stanky-ass
club listening to

34:08.236 --> 34:11.571
some skinny kids on laptops
play some weird-ass beats!

34:11.573 --> 34:13.573
It's gonna be lit.

34:13.575 --> 34:16.243
Stop. Dude, I ran out of time.

34:16.245 --> 34:18.278
All right, now try talking about

34:18.280 --> 34:19.845
how the music makes you feel.

34:19.847 --> 34:21.982
Remember, this is not
Coachella after dark.

34:21.984 --> 34:25.051
Bro, I can see that.

34:25.053 --> 34:27.720
Yo, I just got to say, tbh!

34:27.722 --> 34:29.622
These beats is illin'!

34:29.624 --> 34:33.125
They got the potench
to burn this club up!

34:33.127 --> 34:35.761
- Think that was it, dude.
- Mnh-mnh.

34:35.763 --> 34:38.968
What? Bro, is how I feel
not up to your standards?

34:40.702 --> 34:43.203
Okay, so the music that
they're playing right now

34:43.205 --> 34:46.038
is like an intellectual take
on electronic music.

34:46.040 --> 34:48.808
Every bros says that
these beats are illin'.

34:48.810 --> 34:51.011
Try talking about, like,
the instrumentation

34:51.013 --> 34:54.948
and the unique rhythms
or how a hook, like, grabs you

34:54.950 --> 34:57.082
and triggers a long-lost memory,
like, how that makes you feel.

34:57.084 --> 34:58.752
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

34:58.754 --> 35:00.252
- Okay.
- Yep. Got you.

35:00.254 --> 35:03.055
Yo, these legit-as-shit beats
are making me think of

35:03.057 --> 35:05.191
this one time
I was on lake Michigan.

35:05.193 --> 35:06.859
I was 11 years old.

35:06.861 --> 35:08.962
I had just learned
how to wakeboard.

35:08.964 --> 35:10.129
I was nervous.

35:10.131 --> 35:13.033
I wiped out so bad that I had
to go to the E.R. by...

35:13.035 --> 35:14.767
You know what?
Let's just get a pic of you

35:14.769 --> 35:17.937
and then call it a night
'cause this place fucking sucks.

35:17.939 --> 35:19.638
- Bro, bro.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:19.640 --> 35:22.042
- How's the bicep, bro?
- Uh, looking good.

35:22.044 --> 35:24.113
Hiya!

35:26.113 --> 35:27.781
Okay.

35:27.783 --> 35:29.950
All right, one more. Nice.

35:29.952 --> 35:32.218
- What?
- Oh, shit, bro. She's here.

35:32.220 --> 35:34.587
Get down. She's gonna see me.

35:41.330 --> 35:42.895
No, dude, stay down.

35:42.897 --> 35:44.798
She looks like a robot
with epilepsy.

35:44.800 --> 35:46.165
We're gonna have to
hide out here

35:46.167 --> 35:47.334
till the end of the night, bro.

35:47.336 --> 35:48.935
Shouldn't you go talk to her,
man?

35:48.937 --> 35:50.736
No, dude, I can't talk to her.
Stay down, please?

35:50.738 --> 35:54.674
- That's why we came here.
- I will hurt you.

35:54.676 --> 35:56.075
I mean, I won't hurt you.

35:56.077 --> 35:57.776
Listen, we gotta get out of
here, bro.

35:57.778 --> 35:59.312
We have to escape. Put these on.

35:59.314 --> 36:01.080
What? Why is this...

36:01.082 --> 36:03.116
Dude, just shut up!
Just shut up!

36:03.118 --> 36:05.819
Bro, you have two pairs
of sunglasses?

36:05.821 --> 36:07.620
- Yeah, whatever.
- Ugh.

36:10.926 --> 36:14.326
Let's go. Yeah.
This way. This way.

36:20.801 --> 36:22.901
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

36:22.903 --> 36:24.703
Myself isn't good enough, bro.

36:24.705 --> 36:27.173
No, it totally is, man.

36:27.175 --> 36:29.075
You're handsome, you're cool,

36:29.077 --> 36:31.011
you're...
You're fucking awesome.

36:31.013 --> 36:32.912
And, oh, my god.
I should like my mom.

36:32.914 --> 36:35.247
She looks at me like
a little turd, bro,

36:35.249 --> 36:36.415
you know what?

36:36.417 --> 36:38.283
Have you ever been
to og gallery?

36:38.285 --> 36:39.919
It's a cool art gallery.

36:39.921 --> 36:42.721
And they've got a lot of, like,
cool showings and stuff.

36:42.723 --> 36:44.658
And she has a lot
of check-ins there.

36:44.660 --> 36:47.694
There's an opening tomorrow,
and I'm pretty sure she'll go.

36:47.696 --> 36:49.395
- You know what, bro?
- What?

36:49.397 --> 36:50.863
I'm gonna give you my password,

36:50.865 --> 36:53.799
- and you're gonna go for me.
- What is it?

36:53.801 --> 36:56.903
- You're not gonna tell anybody?
- I'm... no.

36:56.905 --> 36:59.104
Look at me in the eye, bro.

36:59.106 --> 37:02.875
- I'm never gonna tell anyone.
- Okay.

37:02.877 --> 37:04.977
It's "chrisnewton."

37:04.979 --> 37:07.212
- Like, that's it?
- Yeah, dude.

37:07.214 --> 37:08.714
Like, all lower case?

37:08.716 --> 37:09.982
"Chrisnewton," lower case,
that's it.

37:09.984 --> 37:12.151
- Any numbers?
- No, bro, "chrisnewton."

37:12.153 --> 37:14.421
That's your password
for which account?

37:14.423 --> 37:16.756
Shut up!

37:16.758 --> 37:19.158
Oh, shit, bro!

37:42.117 --> 37:45.218
You can't put this artist's
work into words.

37:45.220 --> 37:47.153
Oh, hey, roxy.

37:47.155 --> 37:49.723
Were you at El enfermo
last night?

37:49.725 --> 37:52.060
No, never heard of it.

37:54.896 --> 37:58.064
There are some really cool
pieces here.

37:58.066 --> 38:02.067
Yeah, I'm taking an art class
at the community college,

38:02.069 --> 38:04.970
and my professor showed me
this place.

38:04.972 --> 38:08.341
It's really cool,
and they really focus on,

38:08.343 --> 38:11.944
like, up-and-coming artists.

38:11.946 --> 38:14.080
Honestly, I hang out here
all the time

38:14.082 --> 38:17.953
because I'm hoping
they'll show my art someday.

38:19.421 --> 38:21.120
Good strategy.

38:25.227 --> 38:27.029
Hmm.

38:28.497 --> 38:30.964
You know, my friend Chris Newton

38:30.966 --> 38:33.466
told me about this artist.

38:33.468 --> 38:35.033
Chris Newton?

38:35.035 --> 38:36.269
Yeah.

38:36.271 --> 38:38.971
"Hiya" Chris Newton
knows what art is?

38:38.973 --> 38:41.975
He's actually
kind of a renaissance man.

38:41.977 --> 38:45.410
Oh, so he's just
disguised as a douche?

38:45.412 --> 38:47.412
Yeah. No.

38:47.414 --> 38:48.982
Um...

38:48.984 --> 38:50.316
You know what? Here.

38:50.318 --> 38:52.252
You might want to just
look at his online stuff.

38:52.254 --> 38:56.890
It gives you a way better idea
of what he's like as a person.

38:56.892 --> 38:59.526
- Mm.
- Honestly...

38:59.528 --> 39:01.528
- Try and keep this on the dl.
- Okay.

39:01.530 --> 39:06.435
He is painfully shy around
intelligent, beautiful women.

39:06.935 --> 39:09.134
Get out of town.

39:09.136 --> 39:11.970
No, like, his brain, like,
freezes up

39:11.972 --> 39:14.040
and then his mouth gets all dry.

39:14.042 --> 39:16.142
And then there's the tourette's.

39:16.144 --> 39:18.511
Tourette's? He has tourette's?

39:18.513 --> 39:20.446
- Mm-hmm.
- Really?

39:20.448 --> 39:23.383
Yeah.

39:23.385 --> 39:25.218
I didn't know.

39:25.220 --> 39:27.886
I kind of feel like
an asshole now.

39:27.888 --> 39:31.957
Well, I mean, you probably
still have a chance.

39:31.959 --> 39:35.229
Try maybe speaking
with him in person.

39:40.100 --> 39:42.134
Uh...

39:42.136 --> 39:43.303
See you, cy.

39:43.305 --> 39:45.140
Bye.

39:47.609 --> 39:49.812
Ugh.

39:53.981 --> 39:55.848
Bro! She did it.

39:55.850 --> 39:57.549
Roxy... she followed me
on picto-stache,

39:57.551 --> 39:59.319
and she double clicked your boy!

39:59.321 --> 40:01.220
- Okay, okay, calm down.
- Maybe I should like

40:01.222 --> 40:02.855
a few of her posts right now,
just so she knows

40:02.857 --> 40:04.256
- that I saw it, right?
- No, no, no, no.

40:04.258 --> 40:06.058
- We don't want to seem thirsty.
- What the shit, bro?

40:06.060 --> 40:07.926
- Give me my phone back.
- It's my phone, dude.

40:07.928 --> 40:09.229
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I gotta let her know

40:09.231 --> 40:11.064
that I saw it, bro. I gotta...

40:11.066 --> 40:13.899
- Shit, dog.
- What?

40:13.901 --> 40:15.167
Oh, shoot, oh, shoot.

40:15.169 --> 40:16.368
I think she's facetiming me,
bro.

40:16.370 --> 40:19.638
- Why is she facetiming me?
- Dude, answer it.

40:19.640 --> 40:21.207
Okay, every time
she asks you a question,

40:21.209 --> 40:22.941
just freeze
like there's bad Wi-Fi,

40:22.943 --> 40:25.578
- and I'll feed you lines, okay?
- Bro, that's your genius plan?

40:25.580 --> 40:27.080
Oh, I'm sorry. Hold on.

40:27.082 --> 40:28.647
Let me just come up
with like 12 more ideas

40:28.649 --> 40:31.283
so we can focus-group them and
figure out which one is best.

40:31.285 --> 40:34.419
Okay. Okay. Okay.

40:34.421 --> 40:35.622
Sup?

40:35.624 --> 40:39.091
Hi, Chris. How goes it?

40:39.093 --> 40:43.095
Oh, it's going.
How's it going? It's going.

40:43.097 --> 40:45.999
Are you... did you...
I think you're frozen.

40:46.001 --> 40:47.566
Say there's bad Wi-Fi.
It's worse than the time

40:47.568 --> 40:49.968
you were in Vietnam building
houses for poor people.

40:49.970 --> 40:52.537
- Actually, I can't...
- Sorry, this Wi-Fi sucks.

40:52.539 --> 40:55.642
I mean, it's almost as bad
as when I was in Vietnam

40:55.644 --> 40:57.977
building houses for poor people.

40:57.979 --> 40:59.578
Oh, you were...
You were in Vietnam?

40:59.580 --> 41:02.115
You were building houses
for poor people?

41:02.117 --> 41:04.651
Yeah, it's badass.

41:04.653 --> 41:06.986
- Uh, what are you doing?
- What am I doing?

41:06.988 --> 41:11.424
I, uh... I'm just chillin.
You look really hot.

41:11.426 --> 41:15.294
- What. I look hot?
- Tell her her face is so hot

41:15.296 --> 41:18.196
that... that... that it melts
even the coldest night

41:18.198 --> 41:19.933
because of the radiance
of its glow.

41:19.935 --> 41:21.301
Are you... you're frozen again.

41:21.303 --> 41:24.002
I meant to say
that's your your face is so hot

41:24.004 --> 41:25.270
it can melt the coldest
of nights

41:25.272 --> 41:27.105
- with the radiance of its glow.
- Mm.

41:27.107 --> 41:29.207
You're a bit of a charmer,
aren't you?

41:29.209 --> 41:32.312
Oh, well, what can I say?
You must bring it out in me.

41:32.314 --> 41:36.417
Well, should we see if you can
be this charming in person?

41:39.421 --> 41:42.488
Yeah, sure, yeah,
I'll pick you up soon.

41:42.490 --> 41:45.424
Yeah? Okay.
All right, see you tonight.

41:45.426 --> 41:47.160
Bye.

41:49.296 --> 41:53.098
Oh, my god, dude! We did it!

41:53.100 --> 41:54.334
- What?!
- No, no, no, no.

41:54.336 --> 41:56.102
Dude, what's wrong with you,
man?

41:56.104 --> 41:58.437
We just got you a date.
You should be ecstatic!

41:58.439 --> 42:00.305
Bro, I don't know what
I'm gonna say!

42:00.307 --> 42:04.176
I'm gonna be there by myself.
Oh!

42:04.178 --> 42:07.714
- Shit, shit, shit.
- Oh! I'm not ready.

42:07.716 --> 42:09.549
- Oh, shit.
- Ohhhhhh!

42:09.551 --> 42:11.316
Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.
Look, look, look.

42:11.318 --> 42:12.685
Look what I have.
Look what I have.

42:12.687 --> 42:15.620
- Dude, dude, look!
- What, bro?

42:15.622 --> 42:19.058
It's a Bluetooth!
We can talk on the Bluetooth!

42:19.060 --> 42:21.593
- Ohh! Secret agents, bro!
- Yeah!

42:21.595 --> 42:24.564
Hell yeah, you fucking nerd!

42:24.566 --> 42:26.401
Check this out.

42:28.435 --> 42:30.569
Whoa!

42:30.571 --> 42:32.437
Just like that.

42:32.439 --> 42:34.607
You just happen to have
a fake cast?

42:34.609 --> 42:36.475
Bro, chicks love it.

42:36.477 --> 42:38.678
You're certifiable, man.

42:38.680 --> 42:42.250
Huh. Thanks, dude. You, too.

42:47.155 --> 42:48.620
How did you break your arm?

42:48.622 --> 42:51.457
Oh, I was skateboarding.

42:51.459 --> 42:53.058
<i>- I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.</i>

42:53.060 --> 42:54.359
<i>It's just
super tender right now.</i>

42:54.361 --> 42:56.129
- Unbelievable.
- Well, at least you got

42:56.131 --> 42:57.397
- a lot of signatures.
- Yeah.

42:57.399 --> 42:59.799
- Quickly.
- I'm a pretty popular dude.

42:59.801 --> 43:01.700
<i>Okay, so her shirt
looks like it could have been</i>

43:01.702 --> 43:04.504
made by this Japanese artist
who's obsessed with polka dots.

43:04.506 --> 43:06.238
Her name is yayoi kusama.

43:06.240 --> 43:08.241
<i>Your shirt is great.</i>

43:08.243 --> 43:10.642
- Yay-yay kusumi, right?
- Uh, kusama. I... yeah.

43:10.644 --> 43:11.810
- I love her.
- Kusama.

43:11.812 --> 43:13.312
- Yeah.
- Me too.

43:13.314 --> 43:15.048
Oh, did you see her exhibit
at the broad?

43:15.050 --> 43:16.348
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

43:16.350 --> 43:17.649
Well, actually
I caught it on YouTube.

43:17.651 --> 43:21.490
- <i>No, you didn't.</i>
- Yes, I did.

43:22.356 --> 43:25.259
So while it
still resonates today...

43:26.461 --> 43:30.296
Its tropes feel dated
from when kerouac wrote it.

43:30.298 --> 43:33.131
Well, I still kind of love it.

43:33.133 --> 43:35.567
<i>I find it sexy and romantic.</i>

43:35.569 --> 43:41.506
Yeah, imagine how zietgeisty
it felt reading it back in 1957.

43:41.508 --> 43:45.812
<i>Imagine how zietgeisty it felt
reading it back in 1957.</i>

43:45.814 --> 43:48.848
Hmm. I can't imagine.

43:48.850 --> 43:51.417
Are you... are you more of Dean
or a sal?

43:51.419 --> 43:54.287
<i>Well, marylou,
what do you think?</i>

43:54.289 --> 43:58.723
Well, marylou,
what do you think?

44:02.397 --> 44:04.162
Tell her she has
the kind of beauty

44:04.164 --> 44:06.531
that inspires great works of art
to be made.

44:06.533 --> 44:07.500
Hey.

44:07.502 --> 44:12.171
Your beauty just inspires
great works of...

44:12.173 --> 44:13.506
Ah, shi...

44:13.508 --> 44:15.174
Wait. Hey, wait a second,
you can't do that.

44:15.176 --> 44:16.709
That's my phone.
Hey, give it back!

44:16.711 --> 44:18.678
What are you doing?!
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

44:18.680 --> 44:20.212
- Um, yeah.
- Are you okay?

44:20.214 --> 44:22.348
Yeah, yeah.
It's just, like, a sudden pain.

44:22.350 --> 44:25.785
But what were we saying?
What was I saying?

44:25.787 --> 44:29.154
- Um...
- You're beautiful.

44:29.156 --> 44:31.890
And art's beautiful.

44:31.892 --> 44:35.261
So you're beautiful art.

44:35.263 --> 44:38.163
Thank you.

44:38.165 --> 44:41.669
Wait.

44:45.439 --> 44:48.640
- Are you feeling better?
- Yeah.

44:55.482 --> 44:58.750
- You have a...
- What are you doing?

44:58.752 --> 45:01.888
I'm, um... i'm...
I can palm read.

45:01.890 --> 45:03.321
- Oh. Oh.
- Yeah.

45:03.323 --> 45:06.660
Check this out. You, um...

45:09.464 --> 45:11.930
You've experienced some loss.

45:11.932 --> 45:14.834
Mm. Haven't we all?

45:14.836 --> 45:16.836
Um...

45:16.838 --> 45:21.506
Oh, it was your dad?

45:21.508 --> 45:25.477
Um, you have a very strong
lifeline.

45:25.479 --> 45:26.511
Mm.

45:26.513 --> 45:28.781
And, uh, your love line...

45:28.783 --> 45:33.586
You need a guy who, like...
Gets the whole you.

45:33.588 --> 45:34.787
Mm.

45:34.789 --> 45:37.256
It's a very cute party trick.

45:37.258 --> 45:38.924
- It's good, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:38.926 --> 45:40.526
It's all right.

45:40.528 --> 45:43.328
What are you...

45:43.330 --> 45:44.930
This is another part of it.

45:44.932 --> 45:48.267
Okay. Okay, my turn.

45:48.269 --> 45:49.634
I'm gonna ask you
some questions.

45:49.636 --> 45:52.404
Seriously, do you...

45:52.406 --> 45:53.772
Oh, this is gonna sound mean.

45:53.774 --> 45:56.375
Do you ever feel schizophrenic,

45:56.377 --> 45:59.377
like stuck between your
douchebag school persona

45:59.379 --> 46:03.515
and the, like,
cultured real you?

46:03.517 --> 46:06.819
You know, you just... you got
to go with the flow, right?

46:06.821 --> 46:10.455
If you don't break you'll bend.

46:10.457 --> 46:13.459
You can't make
a horse drink water, right?

46:13.461 --> 46:16.529
Um, sorry.
I'm just really curious.

46:16.531 --> 46:19.298
Do you... do you feel a need
to, like, be seen

46:19.300 --> 46:21.566
by a lot of people
to be validated,

46:21.568 --> 46:24.537
like that's why you do
your videos and stuff?

46:24.539 --> 46:27.406
'Cause you seem like you're
actually really sensitive.

46:27.408 --> 46:28.975
You're saying <i>i'm</i> sensitive.

46:28.977 --> 46:31.776
Oh, no, no, no. I meant that...
I meant that as a good thing.

46:31.778 --> 46:35.448
I... I've won homecoming king
three times in a row.

46:35.450 --> 46:37.683
The third time I was
disqualified for being wasted.

46:37.685 --> 46:42.254
I have 347,000 followers
who watch every dope thing I do.

46:42.256 --> 46:43.488
I'm savage, okay?

46:43.490 --> 46:45.524
I'm not some sensitive chick,
who...

46:45.526 --> 46:46.758
No, no, no, okay. Yeah I get it.

46:46.760 --> 46:49.462
Yeah, it was meant to be
a compliment.

46:49.464 --> 46:52.665
- What? Sensitive?
- Yeah.

46:52.667 --> 46:54.000
I'm not gonna be
some sensitive...

46:57.305 --> 47:00.506
That just...

47:00.508 --> 47:02.008
Dude!

47:02.010 --> 47:03.609
- I can explain.
- You're a dick.

47:03.611 --> 47:04.944
- No.
- I cannot believe that

47:04.946 --> 47:06.511
I actually felt sorry for you,

47:06.513 --> 47:08.613
like, I felt sorry
for your fake broken arm

47:08.615 --> 47:10.582
and your stupid
skateboarding accident.

47:10.584 --> 47:13.352
- My body has tourette's, too.
- Your body has tourette's?

47:13.354 --> 47:15.020
Yeah, that's a thing. Yeah.

47:15.022 --> 47:17.723
Wow! I...

47:17.725 --> 47:19.725
I can't believe that I thought
I could have a real conversation

47:19.727 --> 47:22.461
with someone who karate chops
innocent people all day.

47:22.463 --> 47:24.529
- That was stupid.
- I'm changing my channel, okay?

47:24.531 --> 47:26.064
It's gonna be life-changing
life acts from now on,

47:26.066 --> 47:28.533
and I'm gonna be doing stuff
for, like, Cologne for guys

47:28.535 --> 47:30.035
and how to get ripped abs,
shit like that.

47:30.037 --> 47:32.404
Oh, that's brilliant.
You should... that's brilliant.

47:32.406 --> 47:34.506
Where are you going?
Roxy, wait, roxy!

47:34.508 --> 47:38.412
Yo, seriously, like,
leave me alone, okay?

47:43.350 --> 47:46.951
Good morning, lch high!

47:46.953 --> 47:49.488
It's six days until senior prom.

47:49.490 --> 47:51.357
Have you found
your better half yet?

47:51.359 --> 47:55.394
If not, remember, you only get
one or two proms a lifetime.

47:55.396 --> 47:56.662
Hey, Kat, what about you?

47:56.664 --> 47:59.631
Have you found
your special someone?

47:59.633 --> 48:02.734
Oh, well, prom's an archaic
heteronormative perpetuating

48:02.736 --> 48:06.404
sexist mating ritual
that's outlasted its necessity.

48:06.406 --> 48:09.808
It's patriarchal
and quasi-fascist.

48:09.810 --> 48:12.646
Well, it makes great content.
Keep it up.

48:13.981 --> 48:15.915
Where did you hear that from?

48:15.917 --> 48:18.417
Yo mama!

48:18.419 --> 48:20.419
No, seriously,
Sarah's been giving me some,

48:20.421 --> 48:22.087
like, really engaging
books to read.

48:22.089 --> 48:24.756
- Psst! Cy!
- Fuck.

48:24.758 --> 48:26.558
- Gotta deal with Chris.
- Cy!

48:26.560 --> 48:29.095
- Yeah, I'm coming. I'm coming.
- Okay.

48:29.097 --> 48:30.495
I need to talk to you.

48:30.497 --> 48:31.830
I'm really sorry
about last night.

48:31.832 --> 48:33.698
However, I think
we've set you up good.

48:33.700 --> 48:36.134
Just a little more effort, we
can finish strong, no problem.

48:36.136 --> 48:38.837
No, I screwed up pretty bad,
man. What are we gonna do?

48:38.839 --> 48:42.140
We? Uh, I got her to go on
a date with you.

48:42.142 --> 48:44.542
- That was the deal.
- Seriously, bro?

48:44.544 --> 48:46.611
Dude, that date was the ultimate
fail, man.

48:46.613 --> 48:48.747
Don't you give up on me, bro.

48:48.749 --> 48:51.049
I at least want her to go
to prom with me, all right?

48:51.051 --> 48:52.685
- Help.
- I don't know.

48:52.687 --> 48:55.388
- A week isn't enough time.
- I will double your money.

48:55.390 --> 48:56.888
Double.

48:56.890 --> 49:00.593
So, if I get her to go to prom
with you, we're square?

49:00.595 --> 49:02.995
We're square, dude,
but we're better than square.

49:02.997 --> 49:04.596
We're, like... we're rectangle,

49:04.598 --> 49:06.799
whatever shape is the dankest,
bro!

49:06.801 --> 49:08.968
But don't... you can't
bribe her, okay?

49:08.970 --> 49:11.002
- I won't.
- Deal?

49:11.004 --> 49:14.406
That's a deal.

49:14.408 --> 49:16.508
Dude, your hands are soft, bro.

49:16.510 --> 49:18.009
- Dude, stop, man.
- Nice.

49:18.011 --> 49:19.477
I've got class.

49:19.479 --> 49:22.615
"When I'm with you,

49:22.617 --> 49:27.819
I feel like I'm evaporating.

49:27.821 --> 49:30.756
You're so beautiful.

49:30.758 --> 49:33.591
I am diminishing

49:33.593 --> 49:38.029
like I'm nothing
in your presence.

49:38.031 --> 49:42.767
There aren't many things in this
world that are that perfect.

49:42.769 --> 49:49.774
Your perfection
magnifies my flaws.

49:49.776 --> 49:54.546
I hope you accept this sincere
apology

49:54.548 --> 49:58.584
for my ludicrous,
inappropriate behavior.

49:58.586 --> 50:01.486
Please give me another chance
to prove myself

50:01.488 --> 50:03.622
worthy of your affections.

50:03.624 --> 50:06.792
"Forever yours, cy."

50:12.466 --> 50:16.801
I meant Chris.

50:18.506 --> 50:21.740
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

50:21.742 --> 50:23.075
Fuck!

50:26.113 --> 50:27.946
Agh!

50:33.120 --> 50:34.989
Roxy!

50:39.961 --> 50:41.560
What are you doing?

50:41.562 --> 50:43.995
Oh, th-they're just pebbles.

50:43.997 --> 50:46.131
Well, first of all,
that's the wrong window.

50:46.133 --> 50:48.834
And who throws pebbles anymore?

50:50.705 --> 50:53.071
Seriously,
off my fucking property.

50:55.142 --> 50:57.609
Want to come in?

50:57.611 --> 51:00.647
Come on. Just climb through
the window, yeah?

51:03.283 --> 51:05.250
Oh, you got it?

51:05.252 --> 51:07.051
Yeah, I got it.

51:07.053 --> 51:09.087
That's graceful.

51:09.089 --> 51:10.855
Sorry to pop up like that,

51:10.857 --> 51:13.725
but it's kind of an emergency.

51:13.727 --> 51:15.127
Why are you whispering?

51:15.129 --> 51:17.830
Oh, your parents.

51:17.832 --> 51:19.999
Oh, my mom's at a fundraiser

51:20.001 --> 51:21.933
for saving rhinoceroses.

51:21.935 --> 51:24.169
Oh. Also, wait.

51:24.171 --> 51:26.138
Isn't it "rhinoceri"?

51:26.140 --> 51:29.073
You're not... I...

51:29.075 --> 51:30.276
What's your emergency?

51:30.278 --> 51:33.712
Oh, I came to
talk to you about...

51:33.714 --> 51:38.883
For, uh, about...
Giving Chris another chance.

51:38.885 --> 51:40.653
Ooh! Out, out
the way you came in.

51:40.655 --> 51:42.620
Hey, wait, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

51:42.622 --> 51:44.756
He feels terrible, okay?

51:44.758 --> 51:47.593
He was... he was super,
super nervous, all right?

51:47.595 --> 51:50.629
He would do anything
to make it up to you.

51:50.631 --> 51:51.964
He wore a fake cast.

51:51.966 --> 51:54.767
Like, he's a liar
and probably a sociopath.

51:54.769 --> 51:56.734
Yeah, but kind of
a hot sociopath.

51:56.736 --> 51:59.772
Oh. Why don't you date him?

51:59.774 --> 52:01.339
Okay, wait. When you
think of it like this,

52:01.341 --> 52:03.341
it's actually kind of brilliant,
what he did.

52:03.343 --> 52:07.745
He designed an elaborate,

52:07.747 --> 52:12.850
sympathy-inducing contraption,
all because he was afraid

52:12.852 --> 52:16.721
that just him on his own
wasn't enough.

52:16.723 --> 52:20.562
Really, it's sadly admirable.

52:22.363 --> 52:24.062
I don't even know
what to say to him.

52:24.064 --> 52:25.763
Oh, just give me your phone,
I'll just text him for you.

52:25.765 --> 52:27.700
Nope. Actually...

52:27.702 --> 52:29.602
I have a project.

52:29.604 --> 52:31.035
Be my assistant?

52:31.037 --> 52:32.870
Sorry if I interrupted
your night.

52:32.872 --> 52:35.841
Nope, I was just ordering
leather to make leather pants.

52:35.843 --> 52:38.910
I have no idea how you, like,
survive in that stuff.

52:38.912 --> 52:41.145
I don't know.
It's pretty comfortable.

52:41.147 --> 52:43.381
- Oh, shit, shit!
- What?

52:43.383 --> 52:44.917
I need to, um...

52:44.919 --> 52:46.951
Sorry.
I need to borrow your phone.

52:46.953 --> 52:49.053
- And I have to text my moms.
- Oh.

52:49.055 --> 52:51.924
They freak out if they don't
know exactly, like,

52:51.926 --> 52:54.892
everything about
where and when I'm at.

52:54.894 --> 52:57.196
Yeah, parents are...
Parents are terrible.

52:57.198 --> 53:01.834
Yeah, and I'm just a little
too lazy to go back inside...

53:01.836 --> 53:04.205
- Right.
- To get my phone.

53:05.640 --> 53:07.705
All right.

53:07.707 --> 53:08.941
What are you doing?

53:08.943 --> 53:12.778
- Sorry. Bad Wi-Fi.
- Okay.

53:12.780 --> 53:14.113
- Dude, are you in my photos?
- No, I'm not.

53:14.115 --> 53:15.913
There's nothing in there,
like...

53:15.915 --> 53:17.982
I know, I know, I know. Just...

53:17.984 --> 53:19.384
I don't have nudes.
I don't do that.

53:19.386 --> 53:22.955
Ahhh.

53:22.957 --> 53:24.790
- Okay, all right.
- You did it?

53:24.792 --> 53:27.158
- I'm good. Here.
- Thank you.

53:27.160 --> 53:29.662
Yeah, just feel like a weight's
been lifted off your shoulders?

53:29.664 --> 53:31.397
- You have no idea.
- Yeah. Here.

53:31.399 --> 53:32.865
Thanks.

53:32.867 --> 53:35.401
All right.

53:35.403 --> 53:38.839
- Are you ready?
- I don't know. Am I?

53:44.412 --> 53:47.279
Hmm.

53:47.281 --> 53:48.881
What are you thinking?

53:48.883 --> 53:51.683
No, I'm just... I'm looking.
It's cool.

53:51.685 --> 53:53.053
Thank you.

53:55.356 --> 53:57.022
What's that one?

53:57.024 --> 53:59.424
Oh, just a piece of working on.

53:59.426 --> 54:04.229
It shows how we use social media
to lie and distort reality.

54:06.466 --> 54:08.366
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

54:10.370 --> 54:11.937
You were saying?

54:11.939 --> 54:14.038
I was just saying that,
you know,

54:14.040 --> 54:16.741
we doctor our photos
before we put them online.

54:16.743 --> 54:19.778
And, you know, if you strip away
all the filters and the makeup,

54:19.780 --> 54:23.816
that's where you get the truth.

54:23.818 --> 54:26.919
Yeah, feels like my life.

54:26.921 --> 54:28.720
It's all our lives.

54:28.722 --> 54:30.888
We're all hyper-self-conscious

54:30.890 --> 54:34.695
and feel inadequate, like,
all the time.

54:37.497 --> 54:41.001
- It's awful.
- Yeah, I can relate.

54:43.037 --> 54:45.104
How so?

54:45.106 --> 54:46.874
Mm.

54:49.209 --> 54:51.075
You know, like this.

54:51.077 --> 54:54.078
Your face? What about your face?

54:54.080 --> 54:58.417
Well, I mean, you know,
it's got a lot of flaws.

54:58.419 --> 55:00.486
Like what?

55:00.488 --> 55:02.190
It's stupid.

55:04.325 --> 55:06.125
It's not stupid.

55:12.165 --> 55:14.098
Okay.

55:14.100 --> 55:20.004
Your eyes are piercing,
deep, volatile.

55:20.006 --> 55:25.209
Your nose is the Mark
of a witty,

55:25.211 --> 55:27.513
courteous, affable,

55:27.515 --> 55:30.515
generous, and liberal man.

55:30.517 --> 55:35.319
Your chin is goofy, spontaneous,

55:35.321 --> 55:39.026
light, and obviously adorable.

55:40.294 --> 55:43.529
You've got very rosy cheeks.
That's also very adorable.

55:43.531 --> 55:46.033
Mm. I made you smile.

55:47.935 --> 55:53.037
It's not perfect,
but perfect's boring.

55:53.039 --> 55:55.006
So, no.

55:55.008 --> 55:57.475
I don't know what flaws
you're referring to.

56:05.285 --> 56:07.519
I-I have to go now.

56:07.521 --> 56:09.957
Thanks for the water.

56:17.397 --> 56:19.964
So, does Chris know about

56:19.966 --> 56:23.401
your extracurricular activities?

56:23.403 --> 56:25.169
Mm.

56:25.171 --> 56:27.305
You don't actually like her,
do you?

56:27.307 --> 56:29.042
No, come on.

56:30.611 --> 56:33.011
You do! You like her!

56:33.013 --> 56:35.046
- No, I don't, no.
- Yeah, I can tell.

56:35.048 --> 56:36.314
That's ridiculous.

56:36.316 --> 56:38.049
You're avoiding eye contact
with me.

56:38.051 --> 56:40.484
That's 'cause I'm awkward.

56:40.486 --> 56:44.022
No, I can tell every single time
you've had a crush on a girl

56:44.024 --> 56:45.857
since, like, fourth grade.

56:45.859 --> 56:49.928
Yeah, you get this whole...

56:49.930 --> 56:53.234
Wistful thing about you.

56:54.935 --> 56:56.267
That's what you look like.

56:56.269 --> 56:58.038
Whatever.

56:59.138 --> 57:01.205
All right, I got you a present.

57:01.207 --> 57:03.107
It's... no.

57:05.946 --> 57:08.080
Wait, no.

57:10.450 --> 57:13.618
It's a rhino.

57:13.620 --> 57:15.953
I had a dream
that you were a rhino,

57:15.955 --> 57:17.622
'cause you kind of
look like one.

57:17.624 --> 57:20.325
How?

57:20.327 --> 57:23.495
I think it's, um...

57:23.497 --> 57:25.162
Like, the mouth area.

57:25.164 --> 57:28.933
I mean, look at this
and then your mouth.

57:28.935 --> 57:31.104
Can't really see my mouth.

57:31.671 --> 57:34.140
Rawr!

57:40.546 --> 57:42.647
Cy, okay, listen.

57:42.649 --> 57:46.317
This is an esz,

57:46.319 --> 57:49.254
- an emotional safe zone, okay?
- All right.

57:49.256 --> 57:52.189
Feel free to express
any and all emotions

57:52.191 --> 57:56.028
within the parameters
of this esz.

57:56.030 --> 57:57.995
Stop.

57:57.997 --> 58:00.464
Where did you get that from?

58:00.466 --> 58:02.234
My therapist.

58:02.236 --> 58:05.270
Oh, well, I actually
really like our place,

58:05.272 --> 58:08.674
and I don't want to tainted
with the stench of emotions.

58:08.676 --> 58:10.912
Emotions don't smell.

58:13.147 --> 58:14.345
Okay.

58:14.347 --> 58:20.453
I mean, feel free to be
a festering ball of repression.

58:22.957 --> 58:25.957
Just remember,
my audition is next week.

58:25.959 --> 58:28.060
Hey, don't worry. I'll be there.

58:28.062 --> 58:30.361
Pinkie promise.

58:30.363 --> 58:32.430
- I'm gonna hold you to it.
- Okay.

58:32.432 --> 58:36.200
- You gonna hold him to it, too?
- Yeah.

58:36.202 --> 58:41.605
Just like you want roxy
hold against your body

58:41.607 --> 58:44.308
but you pop a trom-boner.

58:44.310 --> 58:47.312
Ah, kids, get off my roof!

58:47.314 --> 58:49.180
Oh, shit!

59:24.084 --> 59:25.584
- Hiya!
- Oh.

59:25.586 --> 59:29.354
- Hiya!
- Keep it loose.

59:29.356 --> 59:32.089
It's all, like...
I mean, you're perfect.

59:35.062 --> 59:38.031
Fuckin' crazy!

59:38.631 --> 59:41.500
- Hiya!
- Yeah.

59:41.502 --> 59:42.767
What the hell, brah?

59:42.769 --> 59:44.201
You're aping my skeeze!

59:44.203 --> 59:46.238
Hold on, man. I'm filming.

59:46.240 --> 59:47.506
Take a five-minute break, bro?

59:47.508 --> 59:50.042
Alex, what the heck
are you doing, brah?

59:50.044 --> 59:51.209
What does it look like
we're doing, man?

59:51.211 --> 59:52.442
We're showing "hiya" videos.

59:52.444 --> 59:55.781
- That's <i>my</i> thing.
- It <i>was</i> your thing.

59:55.783 --> 59:57.549
Now it's Trent and my's thing.

59:57.551 --> 1:00:02.654
Your social media is lame, man.
Your fans are bored.

1:00:02.656 --> 1:00:04.522
You're losing your influence.

1:00:04.524 --> 1:00:07.526
How dare you stick my brand
on some knockoff loser?

1:00:07.528 --> 1:00:09.761
Whoa!

1:00:09.763 --> 1:00:11.263
Sorry, bro.
You're pretty savage.

1:00:11.265 --> 1:00:14.399
He's savage.
The audience is hungry.

1:00:14.401 --> 1:00:16.834
And if your feed isn't supplying
the audience with what it wants,

1:00:16.836 --> 1:00:19.370
someone else's feed will.

1:00:19.372 --> 1:00:22.406
Just give me a couple of days
to just get roxy

1:00:22.408 --> 1:00:24.308
to go to prom with me,
then I'm back in business, bro.

1:00:24.310 --> 1:00:25.776
You don't have to do all this.

1:00:25.778 --> 1:00:28.281
The feed waits for no man.

1:00:30.283 --> 1:00:33.484
All right, Trent, from the top.

1:00:33.486 --> 1:00:35.654
Let's go. Thunder.

1:00:35.656 --> 1:00:37.421
Hiya!

1:00:40.327 --> 1:00:42.694
You know, when I've left
"hiya" videos in my dust,

1:00:42.696 --> 1:00:45.564
and I'm making life-changing
like-hack videos,

1:00:45.566 --> 1:00:47.165
you won't be laughing!

1:00:47.167 --> 1:00:49.567
Don't throw your churro at me,
you dick!

1:00:49.569 --> 1:00:52.437
I will throw what I want at you!

1:00:52.439 --> 1:00:55.540
Dude, have even been reading
the comments, man?

1:00:55.542 --> 1:00:57.411
- No?
- I...

1:01:00.314 --> 1:01:01.580
"Lame."

1:01:01.582 --> 1:01:04.415
"Nerd af," bro.

1:01:04.417 --> 1:01:08.319
"Kill it before it lays eggs."

1:01:08.321 --> 1:01:10.721
That is how you smoke
a cigarette

1:01:10.723 --> 1:01:14.191
in a bathroom stall.

1:01:14.193 --> 1:01:18.263
Chris. Hiya! Or whatever.

1:01:18.265 --> 1:01:20.832
Now, the lch bros are wondering,

1:01:20.834 --> 1:01:22.200
who are you taking to prom?

1:01:22.202 --> 1:01:24.269
Well, lch bros,

1:01:24.271 --> 1:01:26.504
I haven't really figured
that out yet, but...

1:01:26.506 --> 1:01:28.205
No one, huh? Seems like
the rumors are true.

1:01:28.207 --> 1:01:30.642
Well, you heard it here...

1:01:30.644 --> 1:01:33.211
Delete it.

1:01:33.213 --> 1:01:34.546
I would like to know...

1:01:34.548 --> 1:01:38.316
I said, bro, delete it.

1:01:38.318 --> 1:01:41.589
- Do it, bro.
- Yes, yes, yes, okay.

1:01:43.557 --> 1:01:44.555
Fascist.

1:01:44.557 --> 1:01:46.591
You shouldn't film shit
in the bathroom, bro.

1:01:46.593 --> 1:01:48.493
Haven't you heard of
freedom of the press?

1:01:48.495 --> 1:01:50.462
Freedom of the bathroom, dude.

1:01:50.464 --> 1:01:51.796
I'm gonna tell everybody
you're a pervert.

1:01:51.798 --> 1:01:53.230
I am not a pervert.

1:01:53.232 --> 1:01:54.533
I am a content creator.

1:01:54.535 --> 1:01:56.801
And one day
you will work for me.

1:01:56.803 --> 1:01:59.837
Bro, get out of here!

1:01:59.839 --> 1:02:03.707
There's got to be a bunch of
laws against that, right?

1:02:03.709 --> 1:02:05.676
There's got to be.

1:02:05.678 --> 1:02:07.479
Why hasn't there been
any roxy updates?

1:02:07.481 --> 1:02:09.513
Look, dude, romance takes time.

1:02:09.515 --> 1:02:13.384
Dude, she... she makes me feel
like my heart's on fire,

1:02:13.386 --> 1:02:16.321
like <i>everything's</i> on fire.

1:02:16.323 --> 1:02:17.788
But I've got this reputation
to protect,

1:02:17.790 --> 1:02:21.526
and I got fans to please,
and right or wrong, bro,

1:02:21.528 --> 1:02:25.732
they hate this cultured shit,
so we to wrap it up fast.

1:02:27.667 --> 1:02:29.636
Do you have a projector?

1:02:34.640 --> 1:02:36.774
Roxy!

1:02:36.776 --> 1:02:37.942
It's me!

1:02:37.944 --> 1:02:40.645
- What?
- Hey! Come here.

1:02:40.647 --> 1:02:43.247
Come out. Look.

1:02:43.249 --> 1:02:45.618
- Oh, boy.
- Come see, come on, come out.

1:02:48.955 --> 1:02:50.721
- Come here.
- Okay.

1:02:55.828 --> 1:02:57.761
- Yeah, come here.
- Mm-hmm.

1:02:57.763 --> 1:03:00.365
Okay. Look.

1:03:00.367 --> 1:03:04.002
"The real Chris."

1:03:06.740 --> 1:03:08.609
"Hates pasta."

1:03:10.443 --> 1:03:12.444
"Is terrified of snakes."

1:03:12.446 --> 1:03:15.382
- I... I can read. I...
- Okay.

1:03:19.553 --> 1:03:21.019
Just her music, though, like...

1:03:21.021 --> 1:03:23.223
- Right.
- Yeah.

1:03:28.828 --> 1:03:30.861
Francis... it's creative, right?

1:03:30.863 --> 1:03:32.863
- It's cute.
- Thanks.

1:03:32.865 --> 1:03:36.301
"Loves sunrises over lakes."

1:03:40.039 --> 1:03:41.772
That's where I learned
to wakeboard.

1:03:41.774 --> 1:03:44.875
Mm. That's cool.

1:03:47.981 --> 1:03:49.913
That's... that is true.

1:03:49.915 --> 1:03:51.718
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

1:03:55.622 --> 1:03:57.656
It's a good place to start.
Yeah.

1:03:57.658 --> 1:03:59.793
Yeah? Okay, good.

1:04:07.801 --> 1:04:09.600
I, um...

1:04:09.602 --> 1:04:14.071
I really made a mess
the other night.

1:04:14.073 --> 1:04:15.506
I mean, fukushima was a mess.

1:04:15.508 --> 1:04:18.509
You just kind of
dropped your fake cast.

1:04:18.511 --> 1:04:20.779
Yeah.

1:04:20.781 --> 1:04:22.946
I'm really sorry, roxy.

1:04:39.399 --> 1:04:41.665
Mm-hmm. Do you want to...?

1:04:41.667 --> 1:04:43.067
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah? Oh.

1:04:43.069 --> 1:04:45.403
- Uh, just... okay.
- Okay.

1:04:45.405 --> 1:04:47.339
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1:05:11.932 --> 1:05:13.934
Shit.

1:05:15.502 --> 1:05:16.734
"Thanks for understanding that

1:05:16.736 --> 1:05:19.703
I didn't want to take it
too far, Chris."

1:05:19.705 --> 1:05:23.908
"Well, you're an incredibly
special girl... person...

1:05:23.910 --> 1:05:27.479
And I'm cool with waiting."

1:05:27.481 --> 1:05:31.116
"Well, thank you for respecting
my girl person-ness."

1:05:31.118 --> 1:05:33.417
"Why are you still up?"

1:05:33.419 --> 1:05:36.520
"Can't sleep. Wanna talk?"

1:05:36.522 --> 1:05:38.691
"With you? Always."

1:05:41.727 --> 1:05:42.894
Cool.

1:05:42.896 --> 1:05:45.696
You have a very weird brain.

1:05:45.698 --> 1:05:47.700
I like to see what's in it.

1:05:49.403 --> 1:05:51.468
So, did you know
about the jellyfish

1:05:51.470 --> 1:05:53.738
that's biologically immortal?

1:05:59.780 --> 1:06:02.479
You know, if...
If that's true...

1:06:17.097 --> 1:06:19.497
In that tiny change...

1:07:10.584 --> 1:07:13.017
- Hey, roxy?
- Yeah?

1:07:13.019 --> 1:07:15.720
Is there any possible
reality where

1:07:15.722 --> 1:07:18.823
you might wanna go to prom
with me?

1:07:27.100 --> 1:07:29.167
Yes.

1:07:33.240 --> 1:07:35.540
"I'd love to, Chris."

1:08:14.180 --> 1:08:17.247
All right, which brings us
to a miss Katherine Walker.

1:08:17.249 --> 1:08:19.017
Is that correct?

1:08:19.019 --> 1:08:20.285
Yes, thank you.

1:08:20.287 --> 1:08:22.286
Hi, Ms. Walker. Welcome.

1:08:22.288 --> 1:08:24.221
What will you be playing
for us today?

1:08:24.223 --> 1:08:28.626
Uh, the "morceau symphonique"
by Alexandre guilmant.

1:08:28.628 --> 1:08:33.130
Very ambitious.
Uh, well, give it a shot.

1:08:33.132 --> 1:08:34.967
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

1:08:56.989 --> 1:08:59.924
Uh, can I just try it
one more time?

1:08:59.926 --> 1:09:01.593
Ms. Walker...

1:09:01.595 --> 1:09:04.261
Please?

1:09:04.263 --> 1:09:06.098
No.

1:09:25.819 --> 1:09:28.185
Let's go, let's go!

1:09:28.187 --> 1:09:30.156
Hey!

1:09:33.193 --> 1:09:34.892
I'm in love with her.

1:09:34.894 --> 1:09:37.161
And I'm gonna tell her,
like, tonight.

1:09:37.163 --> 1:09:39.831
I'm so happy for you.

1:09:39.833 --> 1:09:42.966
What?
No, "this is a huge mistake"?

1:09:42.968 --> 1:09:47.371
Or, "this is gonna ruin your
life utterly and completely"?

1:09:47.373 --> 1:09:51.341
No, no, you do you, okay?

1:09:51.343 --> 1:09:53.044
What's wrong with you, man?

1:09:53.046 --> 1:09:56.014
What's wrong with <i>me?</i>
What's wrong with <i>you?</i>

1:09:56.016 --> 1:09:57.982
You forgot about
my audition, cy.

1:09:57.984 --> 1:10:00.283
- I had to do it alone.
- What?

1:10:00.285 --> 1:10:02.019
Oh, no, no, no. No way.
I didn't.

1:10:02.021 --> 1:10:03.854
W-W-What?

1:10:03.856 --> 1:10:06.424
Clearly, your little
catfishing love triangle

1:10:06.426 --> 1:10:08.893
is your one and only priority.

1:10:08.895 --> 1:10:11.062
And since you're always
so desperate for my advice

1:10:11.064 --> 1:10:16.267
regarding your pathetic charade,
here it is.

1:10:16.269 --> 1:10:19.170
Go ahead, tell her the truth.

1:10:19.172 --> 1:10:20.938
Look at me!

1:10:20.940 --> 1:10:22.706
Either she'll never believe you,

1:10:22.708 --> 1:10:24.876
or she'll be so embarrassed
and mortified

1:10:24.878 --> 1:10:26.911
that you manipulated
and lied to her,

1:10:26.913 --> 1:10:29.883
she'll never believe you anyway.

1:10:32.351 --> 1:10:35.018
God. It's all bullshit!

1:10:35.020 --> 1:10:39.959
You decided to live in this,
like, weird fantasy world and...

1:10:44.763 --> 1:10:47.165
I just thought
you were different.

1:10:47.167 --> 1:10:50.300
Obviously, I was wrong.

1:10:50.302 --> 1:10:53.871
You're a phony, cy,

1:10:53.873 --> 1:10:55.942
just like everyone else.

1:11:02.481 --> 1:11:04.182
Well, I appreciate your honesty.

1:11:04.184 --> 1:11:05.750
- My honesty?
- Yeah.

1:11:05.752 --> 1:11:07.285
That's what friends are for, cy!

1:11:07.287 --> 1:11:10.087
You know, also, they're supposed
to show up for each other.

1:11:10.089 --> 1:11:12.889
That's kind of an integral
part of things.

1:11:12.891 --> 1:11:15.026
Well, you're just pissed off
because I can't give you

1:11:15.028 --> 1:11:18.795
my undivided attention
like I used to.

1:11:18.797 --> 1:11:20.363
Oh, okay, you know what?

1:11:20.365 --> 1:11:23.067
Good luck telling roxy
you're in love with her

1:11:23.069 --> 1:11:24.935
or whatever.

1:11:24.937 --> 1:11:27.205
I hope Chris leaves some of
your internal organs intact

1:11:27.207 --> 1:11:30.340
so you can still donate them
after you're dead, you fucker!

1:12:13.953 --> 1:12:15.987
<i>Hey, Chris, uh, this is cy.</i>

1:12:15.989 --> 1:12:17.554
<i>I'm calling you about roxy.</i>

1:12:17.556 --> 1:12:20.825
<i>I think I'm the one
who deserves to be with her.</i>

1:12:20.827 --> 1:12:22.794
<i>I think she deserves
to be with me.</i>

1:12:22.796 --> 1:12:26.130
<i>You're not good enough.
You're not... I mean, you're...</i>

1:12:26.132 --> 1:12:28.331
<i>You're not the right person
for her.</i>

1:12:28.333 --> 1:12:29.532
<i>I think I am.</i>

1:12:29.534 --> 1:12:33.537
<i>And I think I'm the one
she needs to be with me</i>

1:12:33.539 --> 1:12:37.140
<i>and not you.</i>

1:12:37.142 --> 1:12:38.142
<i>Uh, sorry.</i>

1:12:38.144 --> 1:12:40.010
<i>I don't know how else to say it.</i>

1:12:40.012 --> 1:12:41.478
<i>I hope you understand.</i>

1:12:41.480 --> 1:12:44.816
<i>No hard feelings.
I just had to be upfront.</i>

1:12:49.388 --> 1:12:51.288
Love, lust...

1:12:51.290 --> 1:12:56.260
It all comes together
tonight at prom 2018!

1:12:56.262 --> 1:13:00.497
Who's with me?
It's gonna be dooooope!

1:13:00.499 --> 1:13:03.033
Hey. I don't know
what that means,

1:13:03.035 --> 1:13:04.835
but if it involves alcohol
or drugs,

1:13:04.837 --> 1:13:06.237
I <i>will</i> ruin you.

1:13:06.239 --> 1:13:08.038
- Oh, principal Hendrix.
- Yeah.

1:13:08.040 --> 1:13:09.907
Principal Hendrix, the student
body is dying to know,

1:13:09.909 --> 1:13:12.042
what was <i>your</i> prom night like?

1:13:12.044 --> 1:13:14.245
- Picture or video?
- It's video.

1:13:14.247 --> 1:13:17.380
Uh, my prom... captain of
the water Polo team

1:13:17.382 --> 1:13:19.916
fingered my urethra
for an hour and a half

1:13:19.918 --> 1:13:21.117
in the back of my mom's minivan.

1:13:21.119 --> 1:13:24.054
It was a very painful
experience.

1:13:24.056 --> 1:13:27.425
Pay attention in anatomy.

1:13:27.427 --> 1:13:28.925
I love you guys a lot.

1:13:28.927 --> 1:13:32.295
It's gonna be so much fun.

1:13:32.297 --> 1:13:36.068
Is that something that's,
like, easy to get wrong, or...?

1:13:47.881 --> 1:13:51.448
I'm going to tell her
everything.

1:13:51.450 --> 1:13:53.084
I want to show you something.

1:13:53.086 --> 1:13:54.618
Come with me. It'll be quick.

1:13:54.620 --> 1:13:58.555
Just something in my garage
that I think you'll like.

1:13:58.557 --> 1:14:00.392
This way here, buddy.

1:14:03.495 --> 1:14:05.161
Come here, come here, come here,
yeah, yeah.

1:14:05.163 --> 1:14:06.997
There's something back here.
Just over here.

1:14:06.999 --> 1:14:09.599
No, no, no, no, no! Aah! Aah!

1:14:09.601 --> 1:14:10.968
- Give me your phone, bro.
- Dude!

1:14:10.970 --> 1:14:12.269
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1:14:12.271 --> 1:14:14.037
I may not be right
for her, like you said,

1:14:14.039 --> 1:14:15.505
but I can't have you
screw up tonight, okay?

1:14:15.507 --> 1:14:17.041
I'm not a bad guy, all right?

1:14:17.043 --> 1:14:20.377
It's just, I need this.
Dinner's on me, bro.

1:14:20.379 --> 1:14:22.179
But you took my phone.

1:14:22.181 --> 1:14:23.980
I don't want you calling
anybody.

1:14:23.982 --> 1:14:26.416
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1:14:26.418 --> 1:14:29.319
Ugh! Ugh!

1:14:31.123 --> 1:14:32.188
Damn it!

1:15:27.245 --> 1:15:28.545
Come on, you ancient

1:15:28.547 --> 1:15:32.049
asshole computer.

1:15:32.051 --> 1:15:33.584
Oh, my god.

1:15:33.586 --> 1:15:35.251
All right, okay.

1:15:35.253 --> 1:15:38.221
Uh, there's got to be something,
got to be something.

1:15:38.223 --> 1:15:42.059
- <i>You've got mail!</i>
- How pleasant.

1:15:42.061 --> 1:15:45.328
Man, this computer's old.
All right.

1:15:45.330 --> 1:15:47.266
Okay.

1:16:14.026 --> 1:16:16.559
You freak!

1:16:16.561 --> 1:16:19.064
Oh, shit.

1:16:20.766 --> 1:16:23.634
Well...

1:16:23.636 --> 1:16:25.372
"Jk."

1:16:55.534 --> 1:16:57.369
Hello?

1:16:59.404 --> 1:17:01.407
Who is this?

1:17:03.275 --> 1:17:05.276
All right, listen,
you sick asshole,

1:17:05.278 --> 1:17:08.411
I don't know
how you got my number.

1:17:08.413 --> 1:17:10.281
Wait. Where?

1:17:15.154 --> 1:17:18.154
God!

1:17:18.156 --> 1:17:19.790
Oh, my god, oh, my god,
oh, my god.

1:17:19.792 --> 1:17:21.258
- Dude.
- Thank you so much.

1:17:21.260 --> 1:17:22.593
- You saved me.
- Okay, you want to tell me

1:17:22.595 --> 1:17:24.828
why the hell you were locked
in Chris's garage?

1:17:24.830 --> 1:17:26.397
It's actually...
It's a really long story,

1:17:26.399 --> 1:17:29.300
but I need to get to prom.
Can you please drive me?

1:17:29.302 --> 1:17:31.469
Like, look,
you've been an amazing friend,

1:17:31.471 --> 1:17:33.304
and I know
I've been really shitty.

1:17:33.306 --> 1:17:34.638
- Yeah.
- And I'm really sorry.

1:17:34.640 --> 1:17:37.407
And are you still mad at me?

1:17:37.409 --> 1:17:41.211
I mean, do you think that
I would just snap out of it?

1:17:41.213 --> 1:17:44.617
Yes, I am still mad.
You hurt my feelings.

1:17:46.319 --> 1:17:48.318
You knew how important
that audition was.

1:17:48.320 --> 1:17:49.886
Yeah, I know.
And I'm really, really, really,

1:17:49.888 --> 1:17:51.455
really, really, really,
really sorry.

1:17:51.457 --> 1:17:53.523
And I fucking suck
and I'm terrible

1:17:53.525 --> 1:17:55.425
and everything bad,
and you every right

1:17:55.427 --> 1:17:57.193
to be mad at me,
and I'm fucking awful,

1:17:57.195 --> 1:17:59.863
and I'm really, really sorry.

1:17:59.865 --> 1:18:03.533
Okay, okay.

1:18:03.535 --> 1:18:06.202
It's fine.
They said I can audition again.

1:18:06.204 --> 1:18:08.205
My mom, like...

1:18:08.207 --> 1:18:10.273
My mom told them
that I have diabetes

1:18:10.275 --> 1:18:12.475
and I was, like, low on Insulin.

1:18:12.477 --> 1:18:14.812
- Oh, my god. That's great.
- Yeah.

1:18:14.814 --> 1:18:17.281
I promise
I'll be there this time.

1:18:17.283 --> 1:18:19.817
Hey, there, girls.

1:18:19.819 --> 1:18:23.386
Oh, I thought you were
two girls.

1:18:23.388 --> 1:18:26.189
Oh, well, that's cool. I'm down.

1:18:26.191 --> 1:18:28.392
She's 16.

1:18:28.394 --> 1:18:30.161
So you might actually
want to leave

1:18:30.163 --> 1:18:32.662
before the guy
from "dateline" comes.

1:18:32.664 --> 1:18:36.901
Is it because I don't look like
my profile picture?

1:18:36.903 --> 1:18:39.603
Hey, lady.

1:19:03.930 --> 1:19:06.529
So, you don't shave
your armpits?

1:19:06.531 --> 1:19:07.965
I feel like
if you don't have to,

1:19:07.967 --> 1:19:10.434
I shouldn't have to shave them,
mm-hmm.

1:19:10.436 --> 1:19:12.769
- Serious? That's... yes.
- Yeah.

1:19:12.771 --> 1:19:15.973
I just want you to know
I think it's really hot.

1:19:18.711 --> 1:19:19.977
Whoa, hey, hey.

1:19:19.979 --> 1:19:21.879
Suit and tie
for the gentleman only.

1:19:21.881 --> 1:19:23.413
Come on, man.

1:19:23.415 --> 1:19:25.782
Hey, boner boy.

1:19:25.784 --> 1:19:27.586
Ugh.

1:19:28.954 --> 1:19:31.854
Hello! Hi, guys.

1:19:31.856 --> 1:19:33.523
So, most of you don't know this,

1:19:33.525 --> 1:19:36.492
but I'm not just
principal Hendrix.

1:19:36.494 --> 1:19:41.631
I'm also quite an accomplished
singer/songwriter.

1:19:43.836 --> 1:19:46.002

Hey, could you cut the music?
Can you please cut the music?

1:21:58.570 --> 1:22:01.371
Please. Hey, hello?

1:22:01.373 --> 1:22:02.740
Hey, can you cut the music.

1:22:02.742 --> 1:22:04.474
Thank you.

1:22:04.476 --> 1:22:07.877
Hi. Hello, everyone, look at me,
please. Hello.

1:22:07.879 --> 1:22:09.813
- Oh, shit.
- This isn't really easy to say,

1:22:09.815 --> 1:22:11.648
- but, um...
- I'll be right back.

1:22:11.650 --> 1:22:14.385
Over the last month,
I've actually been pretending

1:22:14.387 --> 1:22:16.719
to be Chris Newton online.

1:22:16.721 --> 1:22:18.554
He's actually been
paying me to do this.

1:22:18.556 --> 1:22:21.157
So that way, he'd impress
roxy enough

1:22:21.159 --> 1:22:23.794
that she'd go to prom with him.

1:22:23.796 --> 1:22:25.661
Hey, roxy.

1:22:25.663 --> 1:22:26.964
Yeah, it's actually been me

1:22:26.966 --> 1:22:28.932
you been liking
this whole time, and, uh,

1:22:28.934 --> 1:22:32.469
well, I just really wanted
to tell you that I like you.

1:22:32.471 --> 1:22:34.071
How do you guys believe
this clown?!

1:22:34.073 --> 1:22:36.740
The nerd who went
viral for this?

1:22:37.743 --> 1:22:41.478
- Boner boy!
- Boner boy, right?

1:22:41.480 --> 1:22:43.580
Boner boy! Boner boy!

1:22:43.582 --> 1:22:46.082
Shut up. Shut up. Hey.
I get it. All right?

1:22:46.084 --> 1:22:48.585
I've lived it. It... it...
It sucks.

1:22:48.587 --> 1:22:49.952
It fucking sucks, all right?

1:22:49.954 --> 1:22:53.791
It sucks to be humiliated,
and it sucks to be flawed

1:22:53.793 --> 1:22:57.760
and awkward and weird
in this perfect goddamn world.

1:22:57.762 --> 1:22:59.996
But you know what?
I would rather be weird,

1:22:59.998 --> 1:23:03.901
lame, and awkward than live
a superficial lie, all right?

1:23:03.903 --> 1:23:06.937
Also, I know I've never
gone down on a woman before,

1:23:06.939 --> 1:23:10.974
but I have no doubt that
I'd be fantastic at it.

1:23:12.211 --> 1:23:13.710
We'll see.

1:23:13.712 --> 1:23:17.781
Fuck off, man. Fuck this video.

1:23:17.783 --> 1:23:19.148
Oh, hey, roxy.

1:23:19.150 --> 1:23:21.984
Hey. You both lied to me.

1:23:21.986 --> 1:23:23.754
Well, I mean, I was really like

1:23:23.756 --> 1:23:25.188
his social media
image consultant.

1:23:25.190 --> 1:23:27.491
Yeah, roxy,
like celebrities have.

1:23:27.493 --> 1:23:28.858
Yeah.

1:23:30.061 --> 1:23:32.629
- Shit!
- Oh.

1:23:32.631 --> 1:23:35.198
Yeah, you really made
the right choice there.

1:23:35.200 --> 1:23:37.067
Is your hand okay?

1:23:37.069 --> 1:23:39.670
- Yeah, no, it's fine.
- Aah!

1:23:41.507 --> 1:23:43.240
- Jesus.
- Your glasses.

1:23:43.242 --> 1:23:46.712
- Thank you.
- No problem.

1:23:48.780 --> 1:23:50.913
Uh, you think it's broke?

1:23:50.915 --> 1:23:52.582
I don't know, man.

1:23:52.584 --> 1:23:54.984
- Dude, don't move it like that.
- I'm sorry.

1:23:54.986 --> 1:23:57.824
- All right, dude, it's in.
- Dude, I'm sorry.

1:24:00.258 --> 1:24:01.724
Let's hide.

1:24:01.726 --> 1:24:03.893
- No, we got it.
- Yeah.

1:24:05.230 --> 1:24:06.996
- Hey.
- Hi.

1:24:06.998 --> 1:24:08.965
I... I, um...

1:24:08.967 --> 1:24:13.002
I just... I don't know
any girls like you at all

1:24:13.004 --> 1:24:14.705
because you...

1:24:14.707 --> 1:24:16.974
You make me nervous and scared,

1:24:16.976 --> 1:24:21.111
and I feel like you're
judging me but not judging me.

1:24:21.113 --> 1:24:24.615
- Mm-hmm.
- And when you look at me

1:24:24.617 --> 1:24:27.584
like this, I feel like, ugh,

1:24:27.586 --> 1:24:29.719
like, I feel like
you can see me.

1:24:29.721 --> 1:24:30.953
Like I can't see me.

1:24:30.955 --> 1:24:35.992
And I feel like
like a naked boy.

1:24:35.994 --> 1:24:41.800
But... but you make me you make
me want to be like a naked man.

1:24:42.834 --> 1:24:44.134
Right?

1:24:44.136 --> 1:24:46.638
Mm-hmm.

1:24:48.908 --> 1:24:50.607
What are those?

1:24:50.609 --> 1:24:53.309
- Frozen peas.
- Oh.

1:24:53.311 --> 1:24:55.144
Not for me?

1:24:55.146 --> 1:24:58.117
- Not for you.
- Okay.

1:24:58.816 --> 1:25:02.618
I am so sorry
for embarrassing you.

1:25:02.620 --> 1:25:05.056
And I just...

1:25:14.766 --> 1:25:17.000
You're not a bad guy.

1:25:17.002 --> 1:25:20.036
You just...

1:25:20.038 --> 1:25:24.575
You're actually quite
interesting and odd.

1:25:24.577 --> 1:25:26.678
Just be you.

1:25:28.780 --> 1:25:31.113
Can you see on my hand that
I'd like to give you

1:25:31.115 --> 1:25:33.983
a ride home?

1:25:33.985 --> 1:25:35.919
Mm.

1:25:35.921 --> 1:25:37.054
Please.

1:25:37.056 --> 1:25:39.590
You may like me
because I punched you.

1:25:41.293 --> 1:25:43.794
I mean, it's pretty hot.

1:25:43.796 --> 1:25:46.228
Mm-hmm.

1:25:46.230 --> 1:25:48.066
Yeah.

1:26:03.082 --> 1:26:05.017
Brought you these.

1:26:06.685 --> 1:26:09.318
Pretty sure they expired
in the '90s, but...

1:26:09.320 --> 1:26:11.957
You can still use them.

1:26:16.695 --> 1:26:18.127
Well, at least your
new viral video

1:26:18.129 --> 1:26:21.965
might erase your previous one
from pop culture.

1:26:21.967 --> 1:26:24.901
"Rad chick clobbers two tools."

1:26:24.903 --> 1:26:28.772
So only witness protection
program embarrassing.

1:26:28.774 --> 1:26:31.644
I can handle that.

1:26:41.052 --> 1:26:46.255
So I know what I did
was really stupid,

1:26:46.257 --> 1:26:51.728
and you probably don't ever want
to see me again, but...

1:26:51.730 --> 1:26:53.863
I'm crazy for you, roxy.

1:26:53.865 --> 1:26:57.000
Like, if you if you have any
room left in your heart

1:26:57.002 --> 1:27:00.136
for forgiveness, I'd do anything
for a second chance.

1:27:00.138 --> 1:27:02.038
Stop.

1:27:02.040 --> 1:27:04.875
You're just saying
what you think you should say.

1:27:04.877 --> 1:27:06.943
I don't even think
you know if it's true.

1:27:06.945 --> 1:27:09.379
No, it's you. I want you.

1:27:09.381 --> 1:27:11.848
I'm not a trophy.

1:27:11.850 --> 1:27:15.184
Look, you don't... you don't
even really know me.

1:27:15.186 --> 1:27:20.659
You just kind of made me who you
wanted me to be in your head.

1:27:21.392 --> 1:27:25.996
Look, is is way more beautiful
to watch a rhinoceros

1:27:25.998 --> 1:27:29.935
be a rhinoceros
that try to be an elephant.

1:27:34.873 --> 1:27:37.243
What? What are you thinking?

1:27:38.910 --> 1:27:40.812
Like...

1:27:41.180 --> 1:27:43.982
- Uh...
- Okay.

1:28:35.167 --> 1:28:36.366
Oh!

1:28:56.954 --> 1:29:00.158
Oh, Kat. Whew. Hey.

1:29:03.128 --> 1:29:05.261
What happened?

1:29:05.263 --> 1:29:07.298
A lot.

1:29:08.867 --> 1:29:10.267
I so wish I told you

1:29:10.269 --> 1:29:12.268
so it wasn't such
a true thing right now.

1:29:12.270 --> 1:29:14.403
Yeah, I was I was looking
all over for you,

1:29:14.405 --> 1:29:16.939
but not a phone or a car.

1:29:16.941 --> 1:29:19.175
It's actually really
fucking difficult.

1:29:19.177 --> 1:29:22.213
I don't know how you used
to do it, like, at all.

1:29:29.187 --> 1:29:31.420
Let me see.

1:29:46.404 --> 1:29:49.906
I had become so deluded
from my whacked out,

1:29:49.908 --> 1:29:52.309
hormone addled brain
that I've been missing

1:29:52.311 --> 1:29:54.077
this fantastic reality,

1:29:54.079 --> 1:29:58.581
like, this golden sunset
like, right here, like...

1:29:58.583 --> 1:30:00.250
- Shut up.
- What?

1:30:00.252 --> 1:30:02.352
Shut up.

1:30:02.354 --> 1:30:03.987
But... but I making
my big speech.

1:30:03.989 --> 1:30:06.223
Okay, look, look.

1:30:06.225 --> 1:30:08.058
I only have 15 minutes
until my parents are going

1:30:08.060 --> 1:30:09.593
to freak if I'm not home.

1:30:09.595 --> 1:30:14.930
So do you want to keep acting
like a stupid teen movie scene,

1:30:14.932 --> 1:30:16.465
or do you want to make out
some more?

1:30:16.467 --> 1:30:18.468
I want to make out some more.

1:30:18.470 --> 1:30:21.470
- For real?
- For real.

1:31:12.123 --> 1:31:13.523
Hey, guys, didn't see you there.

1:31:13.525 --> 1:31:14.691
It's Kat.

1:31:14.693 --> 1:31:17.493
Uh, welcome to my
updated natural,

1:31:17.495 --> 1:31:19.595
everyday makeup tutorial.

1:31:19.597 --> 1:31:21.497
A staple thing is this thing.

1:31:21.499 --> 1:31:22.666
It's called lipstick.

1:31:22.668 --> 1:31:25.237
Like, the thicker, the better.

1:31:26.570 --> 1:31:28.404
Oh, my god, this looks so good.

1:31:28.406 --> 1:31:31.041
Hey, guys. Cy here.

1:31:31.043 --> 1:31:36.011
I'm currently trying out
some cool Japanese candy.

1:31:36.013 --> 1:31:40.452
This first one here
is called high soft.

1:31:43.622 --> 1:31:46.458
All right.

1:31:46.725 --> 1:31:48.425
Hm.

1:31:48.427 --> 1:31:50.327
Hey, it's roxy.

1:31:50.329 --> 1:31:53.196
Today, I'm going to show you
some vintage clothes.

1:31:53.198 --> 1:31:55.298
The reason I love vintage
clothes is that I feel like

1:31:55.300 --> 1:31:57.567
you get to, like, step
into somebody else's shoes

1:31:57.569 --> 1:32:00.269
for the day, you know, and you
get to pretend to be them.

1:32:00.271 --> 1:32:02.205
Sometimes I name these people.

1:32:02.207 --> 1:32:04.674
Sometimes I walk around
trying to be these people.

1:32:04.676 --> 1:32:07.212
So, yeah, let me
show you some stuff.

1:32:08.446 --> 1:32:10.080
Wha-ha!

1:32:10.082 --> 1:32:14.017
Hi-hi! Yah!

1:32:14.019 --> 1:32:16.055
Hi-yah!

1:32:17.388 --> 1:32:22.658
I like it. It's like
basically caramel.

1:32:22.660 --> 1:32:24.327
And I like caramel.

1:32:24.329 --> 1:32:26.062
I learned this trick
from my mom.

1:32:26.064 --> 1:32:28.163
Put this on your eyebrows,

1:32:28.165 --> 1:32:30.733
and it just, like, darkens
them a little bit.

1:32:30.735 --> 1:32:34.504
And if you want to go for that,
like Frida kahlo look,

1:32:34.506 --> 1:32:36.372
you just...

1:32:36.374 --> 1:32:37.474
Yeah.

1:32:37.476 --> 1:32:40.443
I love wearing the shirt.
I wear it with everything.

1:32:40.445 --> 1:32:43.779
But I also wear with...
Let's see if you can see this.

1:32:43.781 --> 1:32:47.384
With these pants.
You kind of get the gist.

1:32:47.386 --> 1:32:53.089
When I wear it, I feel like
an old school executive.

1:32:53.091 --> 1:32:56.459
I feel like I can go
and work at a desk

1:32:56.461 --> 1:33:00.130
and tell the boys what to do,
and my name is Sarah.

1:33:00.132 --> 1:33:01.764
I don't know why,
but when I put this on,

1:33:01.766 --> 1:33:04.067
I feel like Sarah
owned this shirt.

1:33:04.069 --> 1:33:06.603
Ha! Hi-yah!

1:33:06.605 --> 1:33:08.237
Ooh! Ahh!

1:33:08.239 --> 1:33:12.474
Second candy I got is
just called premium milk candy.

1:33:12.476 --> 1:33:14.376
Approximation of
what it will look like.

1:33:14.378 --> 1:33:17.046
I decided I'm going
to go on with a darker shade.

1:33:17.048 --> 1:33:19.115
So I'm gonna go on
with this one right here.

1:33:19.117 --> 1:33:21.785
This shade is called
"I killed my mom."

1:33:21.787 --> 1:33:23.353
I use this one every day.

1:33:23.355 --> 1:33:26.255
Just gives me
that really nice kind of

1:33:26.257 --> 1:33:28.291
"just punched in the face" look.

1:33:28.293 --> 1:33:30.393
So let me show you
some more cool shit.

1:33:30.395 --> 1:33:32.661
I'm using this shade here.

1:33:32.663 --> 1:33:35.465
It's called "starvation."

1:33:35.467 --> 1:33:37.267
Not sure if I'm supposed to
suck on this

1:33:37.269 --> 1:33:38.835
of if I can bite into it.

1:33:38.837 --> 1:33:43.175
Ha! Ha! Yah! Ha!

1:33:47.745 --> 1:33:51.514
Aaaaah! Yah!

1:33:51.516 --> 1:33:53.349
Yeah, I think this
is a sucking candy.

1:33:53.351 --> 1:33:56.118
You just want to put
a little bit of your lipstick

1:33:56.120 --> 1:34:00.156
on your cheeks, and it actually
makes it look more natural

1:34:00.158 --> 1:34:02.591
because it's the same shade
as your lips.

1:34:02.593 --> 1:34:06.563
I would say that you guys
only need like $300 or $400

1:34:06.565 --> 1:34:08.430
to achieve this look.

1:34:08.432 --> 1:34:11.334
Oh, my god, my cheekbones
are snatched.
