the proper nuance.

resident of St. Cloud

10:08.608 --> 10:10.143
Maurice LeFay,
in case you were wondering,

10:10.177 --> 10:12.179
also died under
mysterious circumstances,

10:12.212 --> 10:13.446
making him
victim number three.

10:13.480 --> 10:14.748
Allegedly.

10:14.782 --> 10:15.949
And at the heart of the case

10:15.983 --> 10:17.317
is what we believe
to be a rivalry

10:17.350 --> 10:19.286
between Ray Stussy
and his brother, Emmit,

10:19.319 --> 10:20.921
the parking lot king
of Minnesota.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.455
I know who Emmit Stussy is.

10:22.489 --> 10:24.324
Then you can understand
how a rich man like that,

10:24.357 --> 10:25.525
pillar of the community,

10:25.558 --> 10:26.760
might be targeted
by his younger,

10:26.794 --> 10:27.995
less successful brother.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.697
A brother with
possibly shaky morals

10:29.730 --> 10:31.464
and access to
wily criminal elements.

10:31.498 --> 10:33.100
Unfortunately, Ray's plan,

10:33.133 --> 10:34.668
as far as I can tell,
went off the rails,

10:34.702 --> 10:36.436
resulting in the death
of my random Stussy

10:36.469 --> 10:38.371

I'm sitting here today.

10:43.043 --> 10:47.347

believe something so stupid.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.983
Well, sirs, as you'll see
if you try working the angles,

10:50.017 --> 10:51.785
the alternatives
make even less sense.

10:51.819 --> 10:53.453
Especially given
the new victim...

10:53.486 --> 10:55.522
Uh...

10:55.555 --> 10:57.490
Get back to
traffic enforcement.

10:58.658 --> 10:59.727
Yes, sir.

11:02.395 --> 11:05.032
And you, I got
no jurisdiction over you,

11:05.065 --> 11:07.835
but this is St. Cloud Metro's
case now.

11:07.868 --> 11:10.570

Well, you know,
Sy thinks it's time.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.519
(LAUGHS) That's funny.
He said that you...

18:39.552 --> 18:42.255
We're both ready.
We agreed this was

18:42.289 --> 18:44.957
the way to...
Quit while we're ahead.

18:44.991 --> 18:46.193
What's the saying?

18:46.226 --> 18:48.528
"If you love something,
let it go."

it's yours."

My front office guy
took a look at your numbers

19:22.395 --> 19:23.963

your books really sing.

Mmm. Well then,
I say we call it a night.

started on the paperwork.

-Not a real one, of course.

it was a real sex tape,

he's deceased.

earlier this evening.

Yes, sir,
I'm sorry for your loss.

It's that girlfriend,
the criminal.

put the cuffs on.

Are you saying
he had a heart attack?

that you saw your brother?

call Bruce Lipshitz...

for the information.

he meant well.

demanding money,

24:53.693 --> 24:55.862
him and his girl,
with us in the black,

24:55.895 --> 25:00.132
and how he gained access
to my safety deposit box?

25:00.166 --> 25:01.801
-I don't...
-Not to mention

25:01.834 --> 25:03.302
things you said to me.

25:03.335 --> 25:06.906
Accusations, you might say,
about Ermentraub

25:06.939 --> 25:08.741

that urged caution

25:08.775 --> 25:10.142
as opposed to rushing in.

25:10.176 --> 25:11.544
Blaming me, in other words.

I was thinking,
maybe you and Ray...

25:20.920 --> 25:22.021
What?

25:22.054 --> 25:24.924
You and Ray.

25:24.957 --> 25:27.326
Me and Ray?

25:27.359 --> 25:30.229
Is that what he's telling you?
Varga?

Me.

26:19.979 --> 26:22.181
You can always trust me.

convinced now than ever,

in harm's way,

26:37.797 --> 26:39.398

but I really think this is...
What choice do we have?

for our lives here.

26:59.451 --> 27:02.488
I'm sure,
given the circumstances,

27:02.521 --> 27:05.457
maybe this leads
to reconciliation.
