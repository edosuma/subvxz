01:57.670 --> 01:59.420
Uh,
what are you doing?

01:59.420 --> 02:00.750
I lost
my engagement ring.

02:00.750 --> 02:01.500
Oh.

02:01.500 --> 02:03.330
Oh, no!

Isn't that, like,
some sort of --

Yes.

02:05.830 --> 02:09.120
Ugh. That's why I never take
mine off except for surgery.

02:10.120 --> 02:11.250
I'll --
I'll keep an eye out.

02:24.330 --> 02:26.670
You told me to take
some time to think,

02:26.670 --> 02:29.670
which I didn't like, because
two people who are together

02:29.670 --> 02:31.670
should think through things
together.

02:32.790 --> 02:37.290
Look, I-I did a routine lap appy
on a patient,

02:37.290 --> 02:38.460
and she's
not getting better.

02:38.460 --> 02:40.330
She's post op day three,
she's fevering,

02:40.330 --> 02:41.460
she's got
a high white count.

02:41.460 --> 02:44.170
I did a sepsis workup.
It all came back negative.

02:44.170 --> 02:46.500
Okay, well,
I'll think on it.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.500
In the meantime, I think
you should fill Bailey in.

02:49.500 --> 02:50.290
Yeah.

02:56.380 --> 02:57.460
Hey.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.080
You know, I didn't dump you,
Meredith, so...

03:02.080 --> 03:03.580
you don't have to miss me.

03:08.830 --> 03:10.250
Coffee smells good.

03:11.250 --> 03:12.710
You okay?

03:12.710 --> 03:15.250
Coffee smells bad?

03:15.250 --> 03:18.040
Uh...baby's kicking?

03:18.040 --> 03:19.460
You woke up this morning

03:19.460 --> 03:22.750
with a deep knowing
I'm not fatherhood material?

03:22.750 --> 03:24.380
Link, I hate this.

03:24.380 --> 03:27.040
I -- I'm not sure
that I have the ability

03:27.040 --> 03:29.750
to convey
how much I hate this.

03:29.750 --> 03:31.500
But I promise you,

03:31.500 --> 03:33.540
no blood test can change
the way I feel about you.

03:33.540 --> 03:35.670
It's just a matter
of some cells.

03:35.670 --> 03:38.830
I...still have no idea
what you're talking about.

03:40.420 --> 03:43.250
I am more pregnant
than I thought.

03:43.250 --> 03:45.580
Okay...?

03:45.580 --> 03:48.500
Which means there is a chance
that you aren't the father.

03:54.290 --> 03:55.500
It took me a few days
to work up the nerve

03:55.500 --> 03:57.170
to tell you.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.420
We're talking about Owen,
right?

04:04.420 --> 04:06.290
Yeah.

04:06.290 --> 04:07.290
Does he know?

04:08.500 --> 04:11.500
I'm talking to you first.

04:11.500 --> 04:13.460
Because I don't need
a paternity test

04:13.460 --> 04:15.750
to know that I want
to be with you.

04:15.750 --> 04:19.500
I love what we have.

04:19.500 --> 04:24.580
I love your kindness
and I love our ease

04:24.580 --> 04:28.460
and I love that you
make me laugh all the time

04:28.460 --> 04:30.880
and you have yet
to make me cry.

04:32.920 --> 04:35.670
I'm in love with you,
Link.

04:35.670 --> 04:38.330
And the genetics
don't matter to me.

04:38.330 --> 04:40.500
But I have been sitting with it
for a few days,

04:40.500 --> 04:41.830
and you haven't.

04:43.250 --> 04:45.080
So...

04:50.710 --> 04:52.500
Take some time
to think.

04:57.420 --> 04:59.460
Welcome back,
Dr. Bailey.

04:59.460 --> 05:01.790
Quick update on the residents --
we've removed Simms' trach

05:01.790 --> 05:03.210
and started him
on a soft diet.

05:03.210 --> 05:04.670
Helm's chest tubes
were removed,

05:04.670 --> 05:06.420
and she actually took
a couple steps today with PT.

05:06.420 --> 05:08.040
Parker left
for neural rehab,

05:08.040 --> 05:10.250
and Schmitt was discharged with
a couple weeks' medical leave.

05:10.250 --> 05:11.790
Sounds like
you're pretty busy.

05:11.790 --> 05:13.330
Yeah, I am.

05:13.330 --> 05:15.540
So, why are you
glued to my side right now?

05:15.540 --> 05:17.830
I was hoping you could weigh in
on an appy patient of mine.

05:17.830 --> 05:19.000
She's post-op day three.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.500
She's been giving me
more questions than answers.

05:20.500 --> 05:21.920
Mm. Lead the way.

05:21.920 --> 05:23.920
Dr. Bailey. A funny thing
happened yesterday.

05:23.920 --> 05:25.500
I came to your office
for a budget meeting,

05:25.500 --> 05:26.620
and you weren't there.

05:26.620 --> 05:28.290
I took some personal days.

05:28.290 --> 05:30.000
Even when half your residents
are on bedpans?

05:30.000 --> 05:31.380
That's great timing,
Chief.

05:31.380 --> 05:32.710
I asked
some of the other departments

05:32.710 --> 05:33.790
to lend us
some residents

05:33.790 --> 05:35.080
for surgical floor
and ICU coverage.

05:35.080 --> 05:36.250
They were happy to help.

05:36.250 --> 05:37.830
Even so, next time
you want to take a vacay,

05:37.830 --> 05:40.380
run it up the flagpole,
as in me.

05:41.920 --> 05:43.580
D-- Uh, thank you.

05:43.580 --> 05:44.830
Mom?
Suzanne: Yes, honey?

05:44.830 --> 05:47.000
Can I be done?

05:47.000 --> 05:49.290
Just a few more times,
sweet girl. You got this.

05:50.540 --> 05:51.920
Oh. It's her therapy.

05:51.920 --> 05:53.290
I know it looks nuts.

05:53.290 --> 05:55.790
Mei Li was adopted
from an orphanage,

05:55.790 --> 05:58.000
and she was recently diagnosed
with attachment disorder,

05:58.000 --> 05:59.790
so we've been doing
this crawling therapy

05:59.790 --> 06:01.710
because it's supposed to
rewire her brain.

06:01.710 --> 06:04.080
But you got to do it every day,
and you got to be

06:04.080 --> 06:05.790
super consistent with it
every day.

06:05.790 --> 06:08.040
Hi.
I'm her sister.

06:08.040 --> 06:10.210
It was an appendectomy. You said
it went without a hitch.

06:10.210 --> 06:11.380
So, um,
why are we still here?

06:11.380 --> 06:12.460
Take this. Please.

06:12.460 --> 06:14.120
She's been spiking fevers
every night.

06:14.120 --> 06:16.170
Yeah, I know.
I'm asking why.

06:16.170 --> 06:17.380
And I have brought
our chief of surgery...
Mom?
Yes, sweetheart.

06:17.380 --> 06:18.830
...to help
determine that.

06:18.830 --> 06:20.620
Uh, here.
You, too, sweetheart. Here.

06:20.620 --> 06:22.000
Dr. Bailey,
Suzanne Britland.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.380
Hi.
Bailey: Good morning.

06:23.380 --> 06:24.830
Ms. Britland,
how are you feeling?

06:24.830 --> 06:26.170
She has a sore throat.
She has a sore throat.

06:26.170 --> 06:29.250
It's just a little sore.

06:29.250 --> 06:31.170
I'm probably
just getting a cold.

06:31.170 --> 06:32.750
It could still be
from the intubation.

06:32.750 --> 06:33.830
Could be.

06:33.830 --> 06:35.620
I know that the answer
is probably "no,"

06:35.620 --> 06:37.380
but is there any way
you could just send me home

06:37.380 --> 06:38.710
with some antibiotics?

06:38.710 --> 06:41.460
Not until you've been fever-free
for 24 hours. I'm sorry.

06:41.460 --> 06:43.620
Oh, it's just, the kids are
missing so much school.

06:43.620 --> 06:45.120
Well, I can take them
to school.

06:45.120 --> 06:46.080
No!
No!

06:47.500 --> 06:48.380
Okay.

06:48.380 --> 06:49.540
It's okay.

06:52.750 --> 06:53.960
Their dad died
last year.

06:55.250 --> 06:58.000
He had a migraine,
and then when it got really bad,

06:58.000 --> 07:00.580
we took him to the ER,
and the doctors told us

07:00.580 --> 07:02.290
we could go home
and he would be fine,

07:02.290 --> 07:03.170
and then...

07:05.500 --> 07:07.000
...he very much wasn't.

07:09.330 --> 07:11.040
We are running
a fresh set of labs,

07:11.040 --> 07:12.540
and we hope
to know more soon.

07:12.540 --> 07:14.290
Okay.

07:24.040 --> 07:25.330
Dr. Grey.

07:25.330 --> 07:27.210
Hey.

07:27.210 --> 07:30.000
So,
elephant in the room --

07:30.000 --> 07:32.380
I'm not sure what Cristina
said to you, but...

07:32.380 --> 07:34.120
Who?
...I --

07:34.120 --> 07:35.670
Never mind.
Who did you say?

07:35.670 --> 07:37.620
Never mind.

07:37.620 --> 07:39.080
Are you coming
to the pit?

07:39.080 --> 07:40.920
What?
The pit.

07:40.920 --> 07:42.880
The what?
The ER.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.620
You call the ER
"the pit"?

07:44.620 --> 07:46.210
Yeah.
Why?

07:46.210 --> 07:48.000
I don't know.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.580
Oh, my God! Kai?

07:53.580 --> 07:54.880
What's happening to him?

07:54.880 --> 07:56.290
What do we know?
17 years old.

07:56.290 --> 07:57.330
He came in with
shortness of breath.

07:57.330 --> 07:59.040
He just started
coughing up blood.

07:59.040 --> 08:01.380
We need suction
and an intubation tray.
Help him, please!

08:01.380 --> 08:03.500
We should set up for
an emergency bronchoscopy also.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.620
The door is frosted,
and the curtains were drawn.

08:39.620 --> 08:40.540
You can't see inside.

08:41.750 --> 08:43.000
Was I wrong?

08:45.250 --> 08:47.330
What are you doing here?

08:47.330 --> 08:49.420
Um, well, I was thinking
about taking you to breakfast,

08:49.420 --> 08:51.040
but, uh,
now that I see you,

08:51.040 --> 08:54.960
um, I'm thinking eat in.

08:54.960 --> 08:55.920
How's pancakes sound?

08:56.880 --> 08:58.620
What?

08:58.620 --> 08:59.790
I didn't know
you could cook.

09:01.170 --> 09:02.250
Please.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.500
Hey!

09:06.500 --> 09:07.920
Hey.

09:07.920 --> 09:10.210
What's, uh --
What are we --

09:10.210 --> 09:12.170
Oh. Oh, wait.
Are you meditating?

09:12.170 --> 09:14.380
I'm sorry. I can --
No. No, I was --

09:14.380 --> 09:16.830
Amelia said
the baby might be Owen's.

09:16.830 --> 09:18.000
What?

09:18.000 --> 09:19.670
Evan:
Somebody help me, please!

09:19.670 --> 09:21.960
All these blue pajamas, I can't
get any help over here?!

09:21.960 --> 09:24.080
Oh, sorry.
The ER's this way.
What happened?

09:24.080 --> 09:26.170
We'll go get your hand
fixed up, and I promise
you can punch me.

09:26.170 --> 09:27.170
Okay,
what happened?

09:27.170 --> 09:28.790
I'm trying to rush Chuck
to the ER,

09:28.790 --> 09:31.000
and I accidentally slammed
his hand in the cab's door.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.580
Wait. Why were you
rushing to the ER?

09:32.580 --> 09:33.830
Oh,
because of the fish.

09:35.620 --> 09:37.330
There's a fish
inside of there.

09:37.330 --> 09:39.460
What, like -- like,
part of a fish or a bone or --

09:39.460 --> 09:41.210
No,
an entire fish, sir.

09:42.620 --> 09:44.420
Okay, Link,
with you --
Later.

09:44.420 --> 09:46.120
Spilling blood
everywhere.

09:46.120 --> 09:48.790
Kai's bronchoscopy was
surprisingly clean.

09:48.790 --> 09:50.380
We didn't see any bleeding
in his lungs,

09:50.380 --> 09:51.920
just some inflammation.

09:51.920 --> 09:53.040
Isn't that good news?

09:53.040 --> 09:54.710
Not exactly.
Dr. Grey did an EGD.

09:54.710 --> 09:56.830
She found the source
of the bleed in his esophagus.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.750
We're just not sure
exactly why he's bleeding.

09:58.750 --> 10:00.710
Everything was normal
at practice.

10:00.710 --> 10:02.540
He started hacking up
like crazy.

10:02.540 --> 10:03.790
I mean,
Kai's never sick.

10:03.790 --> 10:05.080
Kai's the best
on the team.

10:05.080 --> 10:06.960
He's got the fastest 200
in the school's history.

10:06.960 --> 10:08.330
Does he drink or smoke?

10:08.330 --> 10:10.120
No way. All he cares about
is his swimming.

10:10.120 --> 10:12.170
This bleeding --
you can stop it?

10:12.170 --> 10:14.250
We stopped it long enough
to get your son up to CT,

10:14.250 --> 10:16.040
so we'll keep you posted,
okay?

10:19.670 --> 10:22.710
All the places in the world
to put food...

10:22.710 --> 10:25.080
and yet, no food.

10:25.080 --> 10:26.790
How do you people
eat here?

10:26.790 --> 10:28.880
Three kids who eat
like a pack of wolves.

10:28.880 --> 10:31.670
Richard, you don't
have to do this.

10:31.670 --> 10:33.500
What am I doing here?

10:33.500 --> 10:36.420
Forgiving me or -- or...
putting me back together.

10:36.420 --> 10:37.580
Whatever this is.

10:37.580 --> 10:40.580
It's called...eating.

10:40.580 --> 10:42.170
And I don't deserve it.

10:42.170 --> 10:43.540
Especially not from you.

10:46.120 --> 10:49.750
We just hired
an amazing psychologist

10:49.750 --> 10:51.210
at Pac-North.

10:51.210 --> 10:52.880
She's excellent with sur--

10:52.880 --> 10:54.210
With surgeons
who kill their cousins

10:54.210 --> 10:56.080
and get sued
by their uncles?

10:58.210 --> 11:00.540
I'm sorry. I'm --

11:01.790 --> 11:04.250
I shouldn't --
I --

11:04.250 --> 11:08.000
I'm useless and mean
and depressed and awful.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.620
This is why I just --
I want to be alone.

11:09.620 --> 11:12.000
Can -- Can we just go back
to that?

11:12.000 --> 11:14.580
Can we go back to you just not
even being able to look at me?

11:16.670 --> 11:18.620
Maybe we start
with coffee.

11:23.330 --> 11:24.880
Hey. Hey!

11:24.880 --> 11:25.960
Hey.
Hi!

11:27.040 --> 11:28.500
What are you doing here?

11:28.500 --> 11:31.920
I am on my day off, and I want
to take you for lunch,

11:31.920 --> 11:33.290
and I want to see you.

11:33.290 --> 11:36.080
And...

11:36.080 --> 11:37.830
I want to talk
wedding plans.

11:37.830 --> 11:39.250
That's so sweet.
Mm-hmm.

11:39.250 --> 11:40.880
Mm.

11:44.170 --> 11:45.170
I'm sorry.

11:45.170 --> 11:47.210
I lost
your engagement ring.

11:47.210 --> 11:48.620
I lost the ring
that your grandfather

11:48.620 --> 11:50.920
brought back from France
after he helped liberate Paris.

11:50.920 --> 11:53.750
And I knew that this
is such an important
ring to your family,

11:53.750 --> 11:56.000
and I wasn't gonna tell you,
but then I knew

11:56.000 --> 11:57.620
that you were obviously
gonna notice and --

11:57.620 --> 12:00.000
Teddy, Teddy, stop crying.
It's okay. It's okay.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.500
No! No! It's -- It's not.
It's not okay.

12:02.500 --> 12:04.290
This ring means everything
to you.

12:04.290 --> 12:06.250
Maybe a little.
More to my mom.

12:06.250 --> 12:07.710
You know,
she's gonna kill me.

12:07.710 --> 12:09.120
Or you.

12:09.120 --> 12:10.790
S-She's not gonna know,
okay?

12:10.790 --> 12:13.710
We're not gonna say anything
because we are going to find it.

12:13.710 --> 12:15.420
Okay?

12:15.420 --> 12:17.750
Okay, we'll look together.
Okay?

12:17.750 --> 12:18.750
Okay.

12:20.250 --> 12:23.040
Jackson: Alright,
what happened, exactly?

12:23.040 --> 12:24.920
The bar had an aquarium.

12:24.920 --> 12:27.580
Alright, so we're winding down
Chuck's bachelor party.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.500
You know what I'm saying?
It's his bachelor party.

12:29.500 --> 12:30.830
So, we start
daring each other

12:30.830 --> 12:32.290
to swallow fish
from the aquarium.

12:32.290 --> 12:34.540
You know how it is --
end of the night?

12:34.540 --> 12:35.830
Yeah.
No.
Okay.

12:35.830 --> 12:38.540
I honestly worry for
your entire gender sometimes.

12:38.540 --> 12:40.380
Anyway, he grabbed
the biggest one.

12:40.380 --> 12:41.500
We didn't think
he was gonna do it.

12:41.500 --> 12:42.750
We're like,
"He ain't about to do it."

12:42.750 --> 12:44.250
He gulps
the whole damn fish,

12:44.250 --> 12:45.880
and I guess
the fish didn't like that,

12:45.880 --> 12:49.420
so the fish start fighting back,
start slapping...

12:49.420 --> 12:51.290
just start going crazy,
and it goes in deeper, deeper.

12:51.290 --> 12:53.080
We tried to pull it out.
It would not come out.

12:53.080 --> 12:54.500
And then
it kind of puffed up.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.460
That...doesn't sound like
a goldfish.

12:56.460 --> 12:57.710
Yeah. No.

12:57.710 --> 13:00.040
And according to this X-ray,
this thing's got spikes.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.500
And then I got scared

13:01.500 --> 13:03.120
because I thought
he was gonna choke or puke.

13:03.120 --> 13:05.040
Or that the fish
could be poisonous.

13:06.380 --> 13:08.460
I didn't even think
of that.

13:08.460 --> 13:11.120
I'm-a call the bar,
see what kind of fish it was.

13:13.670 --> 13:15.880
You think you'd have better luck
just writing it down?

13:15.880 --> 13:17.790
Oh, yeah.
Write it down.

13:19.500 --> 13:23.170
"Please don't tell
Roxanne."

13:23.170 --> 13:24.250
Yeah,
that's his fiancée.

13:24.250 --> 13:26.120
She told us
not to do anything stupid.

13:31.540 --> 13:34.210
Hey.
Suzanne: Aptitude is like
having a talent for something.

13:34.210 --> 13:35.080
Great.
Okay, what do we got next?

13:35.080 --> 13:36.170
Ooh. "Penultimate."

13:36.170 --> 13:38.420
Uh, uh...
I don't know.

13:38.420 --> 13:41.500
"Guys, that was
the penultimate concert."

13:41.500 --> 13:43.460
Wait, was it the second-to-last
concert you ever saw?

13:43.460 --> 13:45.290
'Cause "penultimate"
means "second-to-last."

13:45.290 --> 13:47.210
It does not mean
"super-extra ultimate."

13:47.210 --> 13:48.750
Mom, the doctors.
What? Really?

13:48.750 --> 13:50.880
Vocab homework. Did you know
that "penultimate" means --

13:50.880 --> 13:52.500
"Second-to-last."
Yeah, I knew that.

13:52.500 --> 13:55.330
Excellent. Any chance
you also know what's
wrong with my sister?

13:55.330 --> 13:58.960
Well, the labs showed your
white counts are way up again.

13:58.960 --> 14:02.210
It's likely just an abscess
developing in your abdomen.

14:02.210 --> 14:03.620
We'd like to monitor you
one more night,

14:03.620 --> 14:05.880
get a CT in the morning
if things don't improve.

14:05.880 --> 14:07.540
No!
No more days!

14:07.540 --> 14:09.290
Okay, come on, guys.
We listen to the doctors.
Okay, okay.

14:09.290 --> 14:11.000
We are not big fans
of hospitals,

14:11.000 --> 14:13.170
'cause, you know...
last time.

14:13.170 --> 14:15.670
So, we are keeping
brave faces,

14:15.670 --> 14:18.620
but we would very much like
for last night to be

14:18.620 --> 14:21.040
my penultimate night
in the hospital.

14:21.040 --> 14:22.170
Ding, ding, ding!

14:22.170 --> 14:23.790
See, that is
the correct usage.

14:23.790 --> 14:25.540
Lock it in, Matty.

14:25.540 --> 14:29.170
Well, I can't see
why we need to wait,

14:29.170 --> 14:31.620
so, DeLuca,
let's get her a CT now.

14:31.620 --> 14:32.920
Okay.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.580
His friend called the bar.

14:39.580 --> 14:41.420
The bronze catfish.

14:41.420 --> 14:43.210
The spines do give off
a low-level toxin

14:43.210 --> 14:44.500
when attacked
by other fish.

14:44.500 --> 14:46.580
Or being swallowed
by a dumbass human.

14:46.580 --> 14:49.170
But it's not enough
to worry about, so...

14:52.290 --> 14:53.790
So...

14:53.790 --> 14:56.420
...you're not freaking out?

14:56.420 --> 14:57.790
What?

14:57.790 --> 14:59.080
No.

14:59.080 --> 15:01.000
No, it doesn't really
change anything, right?

15:01.000 --> 15:03.790
Except for, like,
everything.

15:03.790 --> 15:06.290
If it's Owen's kid, he's gonna
want to be in his life.

15:06.290 --> 15:07.580
He's gonna want
to raise him, right?

15:07.580 --> 15:11.170
Allison's awesome,
so Owen's got great genes,

15:11.170 --> 15:14.170
he's a veteran dad by now,
and he's engaged to Teddy,

15:14.170 --> 15:15.790
so the kid'll have,
like, eight parents.

15:17.290 --> 15:19.290
It's all hypothetical,
anyway.

15:19.290 --> 15:20.750
Amelia doesn't want
a paternity test.

15:20.750 --> 15:21.540
She says
it doesn't matter.

15:21.540 --> 15:23.580
Wai-- What?!

15:23.580 --> 15:25.580
And you're okay with that?

15:25.580 --> 15:28.120
Oh, wait, wait, are you doing
that thing where you pretend

15:28.120 --> 15:30.080
to be all cool and evolved
and optimistic

15:30.080 --> 15:32.000
but you're secretly
losing your mind?

15:33.500 --> 15:35.250
Nope.

15:35.250 --> 15:37.040
You can love her

15:37.040 --> 15:39.830
and be mad at her
at the same time.

15:39.830 --> 15:42.670
Both things can be true.

15:50.170 --> 15:52.750
Yesterday,
I made coffee in here,

15:52.750 --> 15:54.670
and then
I washed my hands.

15:54.670 --> 15:55.710
So, you're sure
that it's here?

15:55.710 --> 15:57.040
I think.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.250
Wait. Wait.
You think?

15:58.250 --> 16:00.170
Teddy, are we even
in the right lounge?

16:00.170 --> 16:02.670
Yes, yes, because I showed it
to Meredith in here,

16:02.670 --> 16:04.170
and she said
that it was beautiful.

16:04.170 --> 16:05.540
Well, that's great.

16:05.540 --> 16:06.540
Oh, hey.

16:08.290 --> 16:10.540
You're...operating
on a sink.

16:10.540 --> 16:12.380
Yeah, we're looking
for a ring.

16:12.380 --> 16:14.620
You haven't seen one,
by chance, have you?

16:15.580 --> 16:16.960
No.

16:16.960 --> 16:18.670
Uh, maybe
we should, um,

16:18.670 --> 16:20.040
maybe we should
call maintenance.

16:20.040 --> 16:21.420
Yep. I don't think
it's down here.

16:22.460 --> 16:23.670
Okay.

16:25.580 --> 16:27.120
Are you okay?

16:27.120 --> 16:28.040
Hey.

16:29.250 --> 16:31.210
U-Uh...dizzy.

16:31.210 --> 16:32.670
A...little dizzy.

16:32.670 --> 16:35.460
It happens with,
um...anxiety.

16:35.460 --> 16:37.210
You --
You should sit down.
Yes.

16:37.210 --> 16:39.750
I think
I should sit down, too.

16:41.170 --> 16:42.830
Why are you anxious?

16:42.830 --> 16:44.920
I-I'm worried about...

16:46.330 --> 16:47.540
...your ring.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.040
Teddy?
Yeah?

16:49.040 --> 16:51.080
Leo just threw up
all over daycare.

16:51.080 --> 16:52.710
We should --

17:02.500 --> 17:04.710
I've got a couple of boys
at home this age.

17:06.040 --> 17:07.420
I had to read
a whole book

17:07.420 --> 17:09.790
about how their brains
haven't fully developed yet.

17:09.790 --> 17:11.790
It's the only way
I could manage to forgive them.

17:13.380 --> 17:14.920
For what?

17:14.920 --> 17:15.960
Everything they do.

17:17.580 --> 17:19.000
I came home the other night,
and the oldest one

17:19.000 --> 17:20.750
was throwing a tennis ball
as hard as he could

17:20.750 --> 17:23.290
over and over
at the younger one's head.

17:23.290 --> 17:25.080
The game was,
could his brother dodge it

17:25.080 --> 17:26.790
before he got
brain damage?

17:28.790 --> 17:31.000
Sorry.
I shouldn't laugh at that.

17:32.250 --> 17:35.540
Listen, Grey, uh...

17:35.540 --> 17:37.460
the other day...

17:37.460 --> 17:39.250
it was kind of a tough day
for me.

17:39.250 --> 17:41.250
I get a bit dark
this time of year

17:41.250 --> 17:42.790
because it's, um...

17:42.790 --> 17:44.750
it's when I lost their mum.

17:46.620 --> 17:48.790
Cancer.

17:48.790 --> 17:51.080
So, um...

17:51.080 --> 17:53.460
you know,
I hope we can...

17:53.460 --> 17:55.210
start over.

17:55.210 --> 17:56.750
Sure.

17:58.830 --> 18:00.830
How long ago
did she pass?

18:02.420 --> 18:04.210
Uh, two years ago
last week.

18:06.540 --> 18:09.000
Two years is tough.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.380
Yeah.

18:10.380 --> 18:11.750
Gets better.

18:13.620 --> 18:15.880
Not all the way better,
obviously,

18:15.880 --> 18:18.120
but...
a little bit better.

18:22.250 --> 18:25.000
Look at the inflammation
in his lungs.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.420
I mean...you said
he was an athlete.

18:27.420 --> 18:30.920
These are the lungs
of a 60-year-old smoker.

18:30.920 --> 18:32.250
I've seen this before.

18:32.250 --> 18:35.120
I bet you a naggin
he vapes.

18:36.290 --> 18:37.620
Daniel:
Vaping? No way!

18:37.620 --> 18:40.120
He follows
all the training rules.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.670
This is no time
for secrets, lads.

18:41.670 --> 18:43.080
If you know
something...

18:43.080 --> 18:45.290
I mean, yeah.
He vapes.

18:45.290 --> 18:46.580
Half the school does,
though.

18:46.580 --> 18:47.920
And, I mean,
it wouldn't hurt him.

18:47.920 --> 18:49.000
It's not like
smoking.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.380
How is it
not like smoking?

18:50.380 --> 18:51.960
There's no smoke.

18:51.960 --> 18:54.330
Your lungs are meant
to inhale air, not smoke

18:54.330 --> 18:56.000
and not vapors
filled with chemicals.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Look.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.380
See there?

18:59.380 --> 19:01.170
That's what a normal lung
looks like.

19:03.210 --> 19:05.040
That's your mate's lungs.

19:05.040 --> 19:06.670
Does that look safe
to you?

19:06.670 --> 19:08.500
Damn.
That's disgusting.

19:08.500 --> 19:10.170
Disgusting?
It's more than disgusting.

19:10.170 --> 19:11.420
People are dying
from this stuff.

19:11.420 --> 19:12.540
Go and tell your friends.

19:12.540 --> 19:13.670
I mean it! Go!

19:13.670 --> 19:15.000
Go and tell
half the school

19:15.000 --> 19:16.380
they're turning their lungs
into rubbish dumps.

19:16.380 --> 19:18.170
Get out of my face!
Go!

19:18.170 --> 19:20.000
You said "dying."
Is my son dying?

19:20.000 --> 19:21.380
No. He's not.

19:21.380 --> 19:23.040
But with his lungs
in this bad a shape,

19:23.040 --> 19:24.500
our only definitive option
is to repair the esophagus

19:24.500 --> 19:25.920
and remove
part of the lung.
Remove p--

19:25.920 --> 19:28.080
Well, it's not
our only option.

19:28.080 --> 19:30.460
I mean, we could try
to stop the bleeding
by coiling the artery.

19:30.460 --> 19:32.170
Then he would lose
less lung capacity.

19:32.170 --> 19:33.330
Yes, but it might not
be enough

19:33.330 --> 19:34.670
to prevent more bleeding
in the future.

19:34.670 --> 19:36.040
That's true.

19:36.040 --> 19:37.460
But if it were my kid,
I guess I would just rather

19:37.460 --> 19:39.290
take the least invasive
option

19:39.290 --> 19:42.290
and try to not cut
a piece of the lung out.

19:42.290 --> 19:44.210
That sounds safer.

19:44.210 --> 19:46.750
It is safer, and it
preserves lung function.

19:46.750 --> 19:48.290
Then that's what I want.

19:50.080 --> 19:52.580
Okay.
We'll get back to you.

19:52.580 --> 19:54.120
In that case, Dr. Grey,
I'll defer to you.

19:54.120 --> 19:55.500
Well, no. I mean,
I didn't mean that I --

19:55.500 --> 19:56.580
No, please.
You should do it.

19:56.580 --> 19:57.750
Okay.

19:59.290 --> 20:00.880
Rubbish dumps, huh?

20:00.880 --> 20:02.500
You really like
terrifying these parents.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.920
I was trying
to terrify the kids.

20:07.500 --> 20:10.210
Richard, I just want
to be alone.

20:10.210 --> 20:13.000
I want to be alone,
too.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.580
But I came here
to find out why you quit.

20:20.250 --> 20:23.830
Maggie, you're family,
and you're hurting,

20:23.830 --> 20:26.250
and you're hiding
because you lost Sabi.

20:26.250 --> 20:28.620
You've lost patients
before.

20:28.620 --> 20:30.250
Not like this.

20:31.500 --> 20:34.290
Maggie, she was practically dead
when she came in.

20:34.290 --> 20:36.290
Her only shot
was with you.

20:36.290 --> 20:38.920
Richard...
let's not pretend --

20:38.920 --> 20:41.380
Look, the reason
I couldn't look at you

20:41.380 --> 20:43.380
isn't because of
what you did to Sabi.

20:43.380 --> 20:46.120
It's because of
what I did to you.

20:46.120 --> 20:47.960
I...

20:47.960 --> 20:49.920
I sent you in there.

20:49.920 --> 20:52.210
I knew that it was likely
that you would lose her,

20:52.210 --> 20:54.580
but I wanted to give her
a fighting chance.

20:54.580 --> 20:56.920
She wasn't a lost cause,
Richard.

20:58.880 --> 21:00.620
I made a mistake.

21:00.620 --> 21:03.420
I didn't check her ACT
with the perfusionist.

21:03.420 --> 21:06.710
I, uh, I didn't...

21:06.710 --> 21:08.920
know that the protocol was
different at Pac-North.

21:08.920 --> 21:11.500
I just assumed they'd tell me,
and they didn't.

21:11.500 --> 21:14.170
Sabi is dead
because I didn't ask.

21:14.170 --> 21:16.710
I told her I was the best,
I told her I was brilliant,

21:16.710 --> 21:20.330
and I-I couldn't
even be clear in my OR.

21:20.330 --> 21:23.620
I was arrogant,
and I was blinded by emotion,

21:23.620 --> 21:25.540
and now Sabi is dead.

21:25.540 --> 21:29.210
And I can't change it,
and I can't fix it.

21:29.210 --> 21:32.290
And I can't go back into an OR
and pretend I belong there

21:32.290 --> 21:33.420
after what I've done.

21:34.830 --> 21:36.330
Please, just go.

21:40.040 --> 21:41.620
Please.

22:04.960 --> 22:07.380
What'd he have
for breakfast?
Oatmeal.

22:07.380 --> 22:08.620
He probably caught something
from that kid Lucas.

22:08.620 --> 22:10.790
I swear, he is Patient Zero
for half this hospital.

22:12.670 --> 22:15.170
You know, getting an X-ray
probably wasn't even necessary.

22:15.170 --> 22:17.330
Well, you said that
he didn't seem like
himself this morning.

22:17.330 --> 22:18.790
Well,
I say a lot of things.

22:18.790 --> 22:20.420
See?
What?

22:20.420 --> 22:22.040
You are mad at me
about the ring.

22:22.040 --> 22:23.710
I'm not mad.
I'm just --

22:23.710 --> 22:26.040
You are. You're practically
biting the air as you speak.

22:26.040 --> 22:27.830
What? I'm --

22:27.830 --> 22:29.620
Images should be coming up now
on the monitor right there.

22:29.620 --> 22:30.750
Great. Thank you.

22:35.830 --> 22:37.750
Is that --
Yep.

22:37.750 --> 22:39.670
Oh, Leo.

22:39.670 --> 22:41.880
You ate my ring.

22:44.250 --> 22:45.920
Okay.

22:45.920 --> 22:48.080
There it is.

22:48.080 --> 22:49.500
Deploying the coil.

22:49.500 --> 22:50.830
Nice.

22:50.830 --> 22:52.290
Steady coming back.

22:52.290 --> 22:54.330
You know, if you wanted
to do this yourself,

22:54.330 --> 22:56.330
I did offer you
the option.

22:56.330 --> 22:58.120
I didn't want
to do it myself.

22:58.120 --> 22:59.500
This isn't the first time

22:59.500 --> 23:01.080
I've seen lungs
destroyed by this stuff.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.210
That's how
I recognized it.

23:02.210 --> 23:03.790
Very often,
there is a rebleed.

23:06.170 --> 23:08.250
Yep. There it is.
Damn it!

23:08.250 --> 23:10.120
The tube's only a temporary fix.
We need to open him up.

23:10.120 --> 23:12.500
Okay, wait a minute,
because maybe I can
deploy another coil.

23:12.500 --> 23:14.460
He doesn't have a minute.
The coils have failed.

23:14.460 --> 23:15.620
This is exactly
what I was talking about.

23:15.620 --> 23:17.330
Prep his chest
for a thoracotomy.

23:17.330 --> 23:18.880
I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry.

23:18.880 --> 23:20.540
Tried it your way.
Now help me with mine.

23:24.250 --> 23:25.830
Jackson:
Damn it.

23:25.830 --> 23:28.620
It keeps breaking
into smaller pieces.

23:28.620 --> 23:30.670
Every time
I think I've seen

23:30.670 --> 23:35.040
the craziest, dumbest things
a person can do...

23:35.040 --> 23:37.670
the ER's just like,
"Hold my beer."

23:37.670 --> 23:39.170
Maybe he had
reservations.

23:39.170 --> 23:40.620
Maybe this is
the sort of thing

23:40.620 --> 23:42.920
he would never do
in a million years,

23:42.920 --> 23:45.540
but he was in the moment.

23:45.540 --> 23:48.040
He was feeling good
and -- and -- and happy,

23:48.040 --> 23:50.540
and his friends had just
thrown him this great party,

23:50.540 --> 23:52.330
and he didn't want
to let them down.

23:52.330 --> 23:54.080
So, he was just
in this impossible situation

23:54.080 --> 23:55.960
that couldn't be avoided.

23:55.960 --> 23:59.500
Except...if he just didn't
swallow the fish, man.

24:01.620 --> 24:03.750
Right. Okay.

24:06.920 --> 24:08.620
Drill.

24:09.750 --> 24:11.880
Stapler.

24:11.880 --> 24:13.750
Good exposure
of the fistula.

24:13.750 --> 24:16.080
Full disclosure --
this isn't the first time

24:16.080 --> 24:19.080
I've had the debate
about whether to coil
or resect, either.

24:19.080 --> 24:21.000
No? So, I was wrong
but I'm not alone?

24:21.000 --> 24:22.420
Thanks.
No.

24:22.420 --> 24:24.210
Last time,
I was on your side.

24:24.210 --> 24:26.880
Woman in her 40s,
vaped like a chimney.

24:26.880 --> 24:29.420
I was convinced I could coil
and stop the bleeding,

24:29.420 --> 24:31.960
even though my colleague
adamantly disagreed.

24:31.960 --> 24:34.580
I didn't even get
as far as you did before
everything went sideways.

24:34.580 --> 24:36.170
Specimen.

24:39.790 --> 24:41.880
Who was the colleague?

24:41.880 --> 24:43.830
Head of
the Klausman Institute.

24:43.830 --> 24:45.750
Dr. Yang.

24:45.750 --> 24:46.920
Absolute nightmare.

24:49.170 --> 24:51.500
Oh, wow.

24:51.500 --> 24:53.250
I do not like it in here.

24:54.750 --> 24:56.290
Feels like...

24:56.290 --> 24:58.040
the inside of a coffin.

24:58.040 --> 25:02.330
You know, I've never actually
been in a coffin, but this is

25:02.330 --> 25:03.880
definitely how
I pictured it feeling.

25:05.330 --> 25:06.880
We're almost done here,
Suzanne.

25:08.460 --> 25:10.880
There's no signs of abscess
in the right lower quadrant.

25:10.880 --> 25:14.170
So, whatever this is,
it's likely not your screw-up.

25:14.170 --> 25:16.460
Oh.
So, I-I heard right.

25:16.460 --> 25:19.290
Nurse told me my chief was
doing follow-ups on an appy.

25:19.290 --> 25:21.670
Seemed too crazy to be true,
but here we are.

25:21.670 --> 25:22.880
I guess it makes sense,
though.

25:22.880 --> 25:24.670
Ease yourself back
into the real work. Y--

25:29.880 --> 25:31.170
Everything okay?

25:31.170 --> 25:33.330
Not really,
but thanks for asking.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.830
What?

25:36.830 --> 25:38.710
I'm calling a code.
Oh, get her out.
Get her out!

25:38.710 --> 25:41.380
Code Blue.
Code Blue.

25:41.380 --> 25:43.080
Blood pressure's
dropping.

25:43.750 --> 25:45.290
Mm. JVD.

25:45.290 --> 25:46.710
And muffled heart sounds.

25:46.710 --> 25:48.290
She's got
cardiac tamponade.

25:48.290 --> 25:49.580
She's not gonna make it
to the OR.

25:49.580 --> 25:51.210
We need to aspirate her
right here.

25:51.210 --> 25:52.620
Okay, give me an 18 gauge needle
on a syringe.

25:52.620 --> 25:54.040
Betadine.

25:54.040 --> 25:55.710
Come on, Suzanne.

25:55.710 --> 25:56.880
Inserting the needle.

25:58.790 --> 26:00.080
Come on. Come on!

26:00.080 --> 26:02.500
Come on. Suzanne, come on!
Those kids need you.

26:08.120 --> 26:10.170
I managed to remove
all the spines.

26:10.170 --> 26:12.330
You're likely gonna
experience some discomfort

26:12.330 --> 26:14.040
in your throat
for the next few days.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.250
And your hand
is repaired.

26:15.250 --> 26:16.960
Uh, but I need to have you
follow up with me

26:16.960 --> 26:18.290
in a couple of weeks.

26:18.290 --> 26:20.080
Hey, so, you guys, uh --
You guys are smart.

26:20.080 --> 26:21.330
You're doctors, right?

26:21.330 --> 26:23.290
So, how do I
tell Roxanne?

26:23.290 --> 26:24.960
I mean, what should I
tell my fiancée?

26:24.960 --> 26:27.040
Maybe just tell her
the truth.

26:27.040 --> 26:28.620
She might think
it's hilarious.

26:28.620 --> 26:31.290
No, she definitely won't
think it's hilarious.

26:31.290 --> 26:33.170
I don't know, man.
She looked past that time

26:33.170 --> 26:34.790
you crashed her Volvo
into that pond

26:34.790 --> 26:36.540
or when you sorta
got her dad arrested.

26:36.540 --> 26:38.830
No known predators,
Chuck!

26:38.830 --> 26:40.170
Hey, babe!

26:40.170 --> 26:43.330
The bronze catfish has
no known predators, Chuck!

26:43.330 --> 26:44.710
She knows.

26:44.710 --> 26:46.250
Would you two like
a little privacy?
Yeah.

26:46.250 --> 26:47.500
No known predators.

26:47.500 --> 26:49.830
That means you have
worse survival instincts

26:49.830 --> 26:51.790
than any other creature
on Earth!

26:51.790 --> 26:54.750
You are dumber
than a turtle!

26:54.750 --> 26:56.170
Y-You are dumber
than a chicken!

26:56.170 --> 26:57.540
You are dumber
than a frog!

26:59.080 --> 27:00.580
Is he gonna live?
He'll be fine.
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

27:00.580 --> 27:03.080
You may have to modify
the tux to fit over the cast.

27:03.080 --> 27:04.710
No, there's not gonna be
any kind of tux.

27:04.710 --> 27:06.500
I just needed to know
that he was gonna survive this

27:06.500 --> 27:08.120
so that I wouldn't feel guilty
for leaving him.

27:08.120 --> 27:10.290
Whoa!
Babe, I -- come on.

27:10.290 --> 27:11.540
I mean,
they -- they dared me.

27:11.540 --> 27:14.330
Last month, my mother
offered me $10,000

27:14.330 --> 27:15.580
to push the wedding back
a year.

27:15.580 --> 27:16.830
One year.

27:16.830 --> 27:18.580
I told her no!

27:18.580 --> 27:19.710
I said it was just
'cause she couldn't see you

27:19.710 --> 27:21.080
for who you are.

27:21.080 --> 27:22.380
But it turns out
it was me.

27:22.380 --> 27:23.710
I couldn't see you
for who you are

27:23.710 --> 27:26.170
because the sex is good

27:26.170 --> 27:28.170
and because
you make me laugh.

27:28.170 --> 27:32.250
And I just keep excusing
your unbelievable stupidity.

27:32.250 --> 27:34.120
I keep making excuses
for you.

27:34.120 --> 27:35.290
You about to leave him?

27:35.290 --> 27:37.380
Because I ate a catfish?

27:37.380 --> 27:38.580
Damn it.

27:38.580 --> 27:39.710
No.

27:39.710 --> 27:41.500
I am leaving you

27:41.500 --> 27:45.330
because this is not
the life that I want.

27:45.330 --> 27:49.170
And when someone shows you
who they are over and over,

27:49.170 --> 27:50.670
you're supposed to
believe them.

27:57.790 --> 28:00.710
The CT revealed
no abscess or infection

28:00.710 --> 28:02.080
from the surgery,

28:02.080 --> 28:03.830
but there was fluid
around her heart,

28:03.830 --> 28:05.170
which we were able
to remove.

28:05.170 --> 28:07.170
So, she's okay?

28:07.170 --> 28:08.670
She's gonna be okay?

28:08.670 --> 28:09.790
It was
a temporary measure.

28:09.790 --> 28:11.330
Unfortunately...

28:11.330 --> 28:13.830
we still don't know
the cause.

28:13.830 --> 28:15.330
Well, how long
'til you do know?

28:15.330 --> 28:17.080
We're sending the fluid
we aspirated from the heart

28:17.080 --> 28:18.420
to the lab.

28:18.420 --> 28:20.000
We'll also send
new blood cultures.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.290
W-We'll keep looking,

28:21.290 --> 28:22.830
but at this point,
we just don't know.

28:22.830 --> 28:23.830
I-I'm so sorry.

28:23.830 --> 28:25.670
Mommy, Mommy!
Mei Mei!

28:25.670 --> 28:28.290
Oh, no, no, no, no!
You can't go in there!
Hey, hey! Come back!

28:28.290 --> 28:30.210
Mommy, I want to go home.
Let's go home.

28:30.210 --> 28:31.920
Bailey: Okay,
back away from her, Mei Li.

28:31.920 --> 28:33.620
I'm sorry.
We can't risk infection.
DeLuca: Hey.

28:35.040 --> 28:37.420
Sweet girl, look at me.

28:37.420 --> 28:38.460
Look at me.

28:38.460 --> 28:40.670
I'm here.

28:40.670 --> 28:42.290
I'm alive.

28:42.290 --> 28:44.670
I'm not dying.

28:44.670 --> 28:47.170
I'm not sick
like Daddy was sick.

28:47.170 --> 28:50.460
And these doctors --

28:50.460 --> 28:52.620
Oh, baby girl,

28:52.620 --> 28:55.170
these doctors --
they are the best.

28:56.790 --> 28:58.120
They're the smartest.

28:59.620 --> 29:01.250
They're gonna
figure this out.

29:01.250 --> 29:03.670

29:03.670 --> 29:04.880

29:09.330 --> 29:10.250

29:19.210 --> 29:20.670
I can see that.

29:20.670 --> 29:21.790
Uh, and -- and yes.

29:23.290 --> 29:25.330
We are going to
figure this out.

29:25.330 --> 29:26.920
Put every brain on this
you can find.

29:26.920 --> 29:28.380
Create a war room.

29:28.380 --> 29:30.500
We're not letting
that mother die. You hear me?

29:46.670 --> 29:49.710
Let's see what it's like
to actually eat some.

29:49.710 --> 29:51.460
How did you even
get in here?

29:51.460 --> 29:54.000
You know, you all should
really move that spare key

29:54.000 --> 29:55.670
to under
a more convenient rock.

29:55.670 --> 29:57.620
I nearly
threw my back out.

29:57.620 --> 29:59.000
Please.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.920
Please, just...

30:00.920 --> 30:02.790
just yell,
just be mad at me.

30:05.830 --> 30:07.210
Okay, I liked her.

30:07.210 --> 30:09.580
I-I-I really loved
the idea

30:09.580 --> 30:11.420
of finally having
one of those big families

30:11.420 --> 30:13.080
like I saw all my friends
growing up with

30:13.080 --> 30:14.830
when I was a kid,

30:14.830 --> 30:17.710
and I only got her for one day,
and then she was gone.

30:17.710 --> 30:20.250
But you...

30:20.250 --> 30:22.540
you lost your niece.

30:22.540 --> 30:24.460
And probably your brother.

30:24.460 --> 30:26.290
I destroyed your family,

30:26.290 --> 30:29.250
and they deserve to sue me
for everything that I've got.

30:34.080 --> 30:36.790
Why don't you
make yourself useful

30:36.790 --> 30:39.040
and open the flour,
would you?

30:42.670 --> 30:44.040
Guess I can see

30:44.040 --> 30:47.420
who I inherited my distaste
for sharing my emotions from.

30:48.710 --> 30:50.080
When, uh...

30:50.080 --> 30:54.170
I was only 10 years old...
when my mother died.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.460
I don't remember much,
you know,

30:58.460 --> 31:02.120
but I remember
I was temperamental sometimes.

31:02.120 --> 31:04.210
A "hot head," she called it.

31:04.210 --> 31:07.380
But she wouldn't send me
to a time-out

31:07.380 --> 31:10.750
or make me sit and think
about what I've done.

31:10.750 --> 31:12.170
She would go
to the kitchen

31:12.170 --> 31:14.420
and she would make us both
some pancakes,

31:14.420 --> 31:16.710
and she'd say,
"Let's talk about it

31:16.710 --> 31:18.540
after you've had
something to eat."

31:20.540 --> 31:23.460
She didn't get a chance
to teach me much.

31:23.460 --> 31:25.620
But it's a lesson
I'll never forget.

31:30.710 --> 31:32.330
Ah, let's see.

31:39.960 --> 31:43.670
I've been doing it
over and over again.

31:43.670 --> 31:47.670
I've been...going over
every second of Sabi.

31:47.670 --> 31:51.580
I've been replaying in my mind
and just...

31:51.580 --> 31:53.880
wondering what
I could have done

31:53.880 --> 31:57.420
better, smarter...

31:57.420 --> 31:58.420
faster.

31:58.420 --> 32:00.290
It's not on you.

32:00.290 --> 32:03.380
Family doesn't operate
on family, Maggie.

32:03.380 --> 32:05.040
I knew better.

32:05.040 --> 32:08.710
I put you in that OR anyway
out of desperation.

32:08.710 --> 32:10.880
I made a mistake.

32:10.880 --> 32:12.620
And now Sabi is dead.

32:12.620 --> 32:14.210
And you'll never
make that mistake again.

32:15.920 --> 32:17.250
That's what you say
to interns

32:17.250 --> 32:20.120
who -- who have lost
their first patient, not to --

32:20.120 --> 32:22.080
They're human.

32:22.080 --> 32:24.080
And imperfect.

32:24.080 --> 32:25.580
Like you.

32:30.290 --> 32:33.040
No one has ever
had to tell me that before.

32:33.040 --> 32:35.040
Then let Sabi's legacy
be that.

32:35.040 --> 32:36.210
She taught you

32:36.210 --> 32:39.330
what years of school
and residency

32:39.330 --> 32:41.290
and countless hours
never did.

32:41.290 --> 32:44.880
Maggie, you have insurance
for this.

32:44.880 --> 32:46.790
They'll settle with Chris.

32:46.790 --> 32:48.330
It won't bring Sabi back,

32:48.330 --> 32:53.420
but he'll feel like
he's got some justice for her.

32:53.420 --> 32:55.500
And he needs that.

32:55.500 --> 32:58.580
Every surgeon I know
goes through this.

32:58.580 --> 33:01.080
And if you quit now,
you'll be quitting

33:01.080 --> 33:04.120
on all those lives
that only you can save.

33:04.120 --> 33:06.210
And I know
Sabi wouldn't want that.

33:10.830 --> 33:12.830
I wish I could've had
more time with her.

33:12.830 --> 33:16.210
Well, ask me
anything you want about her.

33:16.210 --> 33:17.960
No. Richard,
I am not gonna make you --

33:17.960 --> 33:20.500
No, you know, truth be told,
talking about her

33:20.500 --> 33:22.540
is about the only thing
I want to do right now.

33:30.040 --> 33:31.380
Okay,
you don't have to stay

33:31.380 --> 33:33.500
if you need
to check in downstairs.

33:33.500 --> 33:35.250
No, I'm staying.
I feel awful.

33:35.250 --> 33:37.120
Listen, we know
where the ring is, Teddy,

33:37.120 --> 33:38.790
and it's not
perforating anything.

33:38.790 --> 33:40.250
He's gonna be fine.

33:40.250 --> 33:41.920
I mean, kids do
this kind of stuff, you know?

33:41.920 --> 33:43.750
We see cases like this
all the time.

33:43.750 --> 33:45.670
I know, Owen,
but I feel awful.

33:45.670 --> 33:49.460
I mean, your grandmother
and your mom all wore the ring,

33:49.460 --> 33:51.500
and it's survived
in your family for years,

33:51.500 --> 33:53.290
through wars
and depressions,

33:53.290 --> 33:55.380
and I couldn't even
keep it for a week.

33:55.380 --> 33:57.420
'Cause you're tired
and overworked, you know?

33:57.420 --> 33:59.290
Could have been
a lot worse.

33:59.290 --> 34:01.170
You know, at least you didn't
leave it inside a patient.

34:01.170 --> 34:03.040
Yeah, well,
now it's inside our child.

34:04.920 --> 34:07.880
Teddy, I shouldn't have
given you the ring
in the first place.

34:07.880 --> 34:09.580
You're a trauma surgeon.

34:09.580 --> 34:12.000
No, but I-I want
to wear the ring.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.380
I love the ring.

34:13.380 --> 34:14.420
And --

34:14.420 --> 34:16.000
And I-I love you.

34:18.580 --> 34:20.210
Okay.

34:20.210 --> 34:21.460
You have a necklace.
Mm-hmm.

34:21.460 --> 34:24.210
And you have an A for Allison
and an L for Leo.

34:24.210 --> 34:26.580
How about
we add a T and an O

34:26.580 --> 34:29.250
and you can wear
your entire family
around your neck?

34:29.250 --> 34:30.920
Okay?

34:30.920 --> 34:33.330
And we're gonna
keep that ring in a safe

34:33.330 --> 34:34.750
for special occasions,
okay?

34:36.210 --> 34:38.670
I have never
loved you more.

34:44.080 --> 34:45.460
Do you smell that?

34:45.460 --> 34:46.620
Mm-hmm.

34:48.540 --> 34:49.790
Okay.

34:51.500 --> 34:52.620
Rock --

34:52.620 --> 34:54.620
You know what? I got it.
This one's on me.

34:54.620 --> 34:56.790
You sure?
Mm-hmm.

34:56.790 --> 34:59.000
'Cause it's...
I know. Go.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.420
Let's do this.

35:08.040 --> 35:09.670
Kai's condition
was too advanced

35:09.670 --> 35:11.750
to successfully coil
the bleeding vessel,

35:11.750 --> 35:14.710
so we had to open him up,
do the partial lung resection.

35:16.420 --> 35:18.250
It's going to be
a difficult recovery.

35:18.250 --> 35:20.290
In time, he will
be able to swim,

35:20.290 --> 35:23.790
but not competitively,
I'm afraid.

35:23.790 --> 35:25.880
That stuff --

35:25.880 --> 35:28.170
it's flavored
like French toast, right?

35:28.170 --> 35:29.420
Mm-hmm.

35:29.420 --> 35:32.330
I always smell
French toast.

35:32.330 --> 35:34.120
I feel like an idiot
I didn't know.

35:34.120 --> 35:35.670
They're targeting kids.

35:35.670 --> 35:39.790
It's flavored like cotton candy
and bubble gum, as well.

35:39.790 --> 35:41.620
You're not an idiot.

35:41.620 --> 35:43.170
They're evil.

35:46.210 --> 35:48.710
Thank you
for saving my son.

35:55.040 --> 35:57.710
Don't worry.
I won't rub it in.

35:57.710 --> 35:58.920
I'm sorry.

36:00.330 --> 36:02.920
Listen, when I was
on the other side of this,

36:02.920 --> 36:04.420
Yang drove me mad.

36:04.420 --> 36:07.380
She'd leave me notes
all over the place
every day for months.

36:07.380 --> 36:09.210
"I was right.
You were wrong."

36:09.210 --> 36:11.210
Little pictures
of resected lungs.

36:11.210 --> 36:12.960
Well,
sounds about right.

36:14.580 --> 36:16.120
Wait, you know her?

36:17.750 --> 36:19.290
I, um...

36:19.290 --> 36:20.620
W--

36:20.620 --> 36:23.170
Um...I gotta go.

36:23.170 --> 36:25.960
Meredith:
Most patients put off facing
the truth as long as possible.

36:25.960 --> 36:27.380
And we get it.

36:27.380 --> 36:28.790
We do it, too.

36:28.790 --> 36:30.460
We ignore things.

36:30.460 --> 36:32.000
We stay under the covers.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.880
We don't pick up the phone.

36:33.880 --> 36:36.620
Ah. I thought you'd have
some work to catch up on.

36:36.620 --> 36:38.620
You -- You probably need
to do some unpacking,

36:38.620 --> 36:40.670
shake the sand out from
the beach, do some laundry --

36:40.670 --> 36:43.040
I wasn't on vacation,
Tom.

36:43.040 --> 36:45.210
I sat in my house
for three days.

36:45.210 --> 36:47.620
I didn't get out of bed,
I drank chamomile tea,

36:47.620 --> 36:51.170
and I cried my eyes out
because I had a miscarriage.

36:51.170 --> 36:54.500
That happened,
I'm sad about it,

36:54.500 --> 36:55.750
and I'm taking care
of myself.

36:55.750 --> 36:56.880
Any questions?

36:56.880 --> 36:58.080
You could have told me.

36:58.080 --> 36:59.040
I just did.

37:00.120 --> 37:01.460
W-- Light a candle.

37:01.460 --> 37:02.880
What?

37:02.880 --> 37:05.420
When my wife --
uh, my ex-wife, uh, Dana --

37:05.420 --> 37:08.580
she miscarried twice
before we had David.

37:08.580 --> 37:12.380
Once at 10 weeks,
once at 18, which was --

37:12.380 --> 37:14.880
well, I mean, you know --
you know how it was.

37:14.880 --> 37:17.290
I mean, people have
this idea that, uh...

37:17.290 --> 37:18.540
you just get over it,

37:18.540 --> 37:22.290
that, uh, you know,
you're sad and you move on.

37:22.290 --> 37:25.420
But...that wasn't
my experience.

37:25.420 --> 37:27.920
Wasn't
my wife's experience.

37:27.920 --> 37:30.210
So every year, still,

37:30.210 --> 37:33.210
uh, on what would be
their birthdays,

37:33.210 --> 37:36.170
I, uh,
I light a candle.

37:36.170 --> 37:40.880
They took with them
little pieces of our...hearts,

37:40.880 --> 37:43.420
and those pieces
will never be...

37:43.420 --> 37:44.620
replaced.

37:46.790 --> 37:49.620
So, maybe, uh...

37:49.620 --> 37:50.580
light a candle.

37:52.750 --> 37:54.210
Yeah.

38:01.670 --> 38:05.290
We don't face the music
and all that crap.

38:05.290 --> 38:08.830
♪ Mamma,
you have shown me love ♪

38:08.830 --> 38:11.170
You paged me
to the plant room.

38:13.040 --> 38:14.580
Never a good sign.

38:18.250 --> 38:20.000
When someone shows you
who they are,

38:20.000 --> 38:22.080
you're supposed to
believe them.

38:23.460 --> 38:26.330
Someone said that today,
and it -- it kinda hit me.

38:28.960 --> 38:31.210
We're doctors.

38:31.210 --> 38:33.210
There are tests.

38:33.210 --> 38:37.080
If there was a question
who the father was,

38:37.080 --> 38:39.460
I should have known that
from the beginning.

38:39.460 --> 38:40.750
You're right.

38:40.750 --> 38:43.540
I'm not always...

38:43.540 --> 38:44.790
measured.

38:46.000 --> 38:49.170
I'm not ever measured.

38:51.540 --> 38:53.670
I'm a little bit chaotic.

38:53.670 --> 38:56.000
I fly
by the seat of my pants,

38:56.000 --> 38:58.830
and I...don't think things
all the way through,

38:58.830 --> 39:01.420
and...

39:01.420 --> 39:03.040
sometimes
that hurts people.

39:05.750 --> 39:07.420
I'm sorry
that I hurt you.

39:08.790 --> 39:12.380

39:12.380 --> 39:15.750
There are a bunch of people
involved in this.

39:15.750 --> 39:18.080
And they deserve to know.

39:20.880 --> 39:22.880
I deserve to know.

39:22.880 --> 39:26.960
♪ I'm captured
by the good you do ♪

39:26.960 --> 39:30.920
And if we do
find out...

39:30.920 --> 39:33.420
that you're not
the father?

39:33.420 --> 39:36.790
I want to be the guy that says,
uh, it doesn't matter,

39:36.790 --> 39:39.080
but I don't know yet.

39:39.080 --> 39:41.420
I don't know
how much it matters.

39:41.420 --> 39:45.000
I guess --
I-I think we should...

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
take it
one step at a time.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.330
Gather information.

39:57.250 --> 40:00.670
So much for me
never making you cry.

40:00.670 --> 40:05.380
But the longer we hide,
the worse it can be.

40:05.380 --> 40:07.620
So, open the test results.

40:07.620 --> 40:08.710
Hey.

40:08.710 --> 40:09.920
Have the hard conversation.

40:09.920 --> 40:11.080
I got your text.

40:11.080 --> 40:12.750
Say what you mean.

40:12.750 --> 40:14.290
Hey, maybe
we should go to dinner

40:14.290 --> 40:16.040
and clear your head
a little bit.

40:16.040 --> 40:18.330
Her name's Suzanne,
she's got two young kids,

40:18.330 --> 40:20.580
she's a single mom,
and I think she's dying.

40:20.580 --> 40:22.380
Okay.
Are these from today?

40:22.380 --> 40:23.620
Yeah,
she crashed on me.

40:23.620 --> 40:26.500
I had to aspirate
a cardiac tamponade -- in CT.

40:26.500 --> 40:27.790
I don't get it.

40:27.790 --> 40:29.500
It was a simple appy,
a no-brainer case,

40:29.500 --> 40:31.790
and -- and now,
I mean, look at all this.

40:31.790 --> 40:33.880
She's --
She's getting worse.

40:33.880 --> 40:35.460
And I don't know why
or how to help her.

40:35.460 --> 40:36.500
Hey.

40:36.500 --> 40:39.170
Andrew, look at me.

40:39.170 --> 40:41.120
Walk me through it.
From the beginning.

40:41.120 --> 40:43.540
Good or bad...
Okay.

40:43.540 --> 40:45.420
...you may be surprised
at what you find.

40:45.420 --> 40:46.750
You're right. Okay.

40:46.750 --> 40:48.830

Uh, uneventful.

41:28.500 --> 41:31.920
Dr. Wells from Pac-North called,
looking for you.

41:31.920 --> 41:34.580
Said you didn't go to work.

41:34.580 --> 41:36.000
I didn't.

41:36.000 --> 41:40.290
I was...trying to convince
Maggie to go back to work.

41:40.290 --> 41:42.750

42:01.830 --> 42:03.210
