03:02.527 --> 03:04.563
If it doesn't hold the curve,

03:04.598 --> 03:07.704
the ski is going to want
to dive into the snow,

03:07.739 --> 03:10.569
and that's not going
to work out very good.

03:10.604 --> 03:14.124
The whole idea of skis is,
you can just slide them forward.

03:14.159 --> 03:17.162
Morgan will steam the wood

going here on the stove.

much of it is compromised.

19:22.471 --> 19:26.441
The water that's inside
a living tree freezes,

19:26.475 --> 19:27.718

19:27.752 --> 19:31.066
an ice block

19:49.153 --> 19:53.226
My plan is to find some logs
on the shores of an island

19:53.261 --> 19:56.402
that lies about
5 miles from here.

19:56.436 --> 19:59.232
It's a place where prevailing
winds generally push logs

19:59.267 --> 20:00.682
and driftwood
up out of the ocean

20:00.716 --> 20:02.994
and onto the beach.

20:03.029 --> 20:05.376
And, if it's been in salt water,
it's been cured to the point

20:05.411 --> 20:09.277
where it's going to be stable
enough for me to build with.

20:09.311 --> 20:12.901

Just as salt draws moisture from
meat in order to preserve it,

20:12.935 --> 20:15.524
timber that's been exposed
to salty sea water

20:15.559 --> 20:17.630
is protected by
a type of curing.

20:17.664 --> 20:19.148
The salt prevents moisture

20:19.183 --> 20:21.185
from rotting
the log's heartwood.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.567
But, to find enough
cured driftwood,

20:23.601 --> 20:24.809

20:24.844 --> 20:27.398
the freezing waters

20:42.586 --> 20:44.898
It's always a sketchy feeling
leaving the shore.

20:44.933 --> 20:47.453
Once you reach the open water,
you're leaving the safety

20:47.487 --> 20:50.801

land close by.

across a 3-mile-wide channel

20:54.874 --> 20:58.015
that's a gauntlet of
dangerous currents and tides.

20:58.049 --> 21:01.225
Brent:
Alaska experiences some of the
most extreme tides in the world.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.986
Right now, there's about
a 22-foot tide swing,

21:04.021 --> 21:06.403
so that's a lot of surging
and a lot of powerful water

21:06.437 --> 21:10.027
moving very quickly
in and out.

21:10.061 --> 21:12.478
There's essentially mountains
under the ocean,

21:12.512 --> 21:13.893
so when those currents
get to ripping

21:13.927 --> 21:16.309
and the tide is moving fast,
it can create whirlpools.

21:16.344 --> 21:19.554
And waves are going one way and
then crashing in the other way,

21:19.588 --> 21:22.004
and it creates a whole mess
of problems out there.

21:23.868 --> 21:25.629
When you get in the wrong
current in a little boat

21:25.663 --> 21:26.906
like this,

21:26.940 --> 21:32.291
you get swept out
to the open ocean in no time.

21:32.325 --> 21:36.295
Narrator:
Every crossing carries dangers
from below and above.

21:36.329 --> 21:39.677
The channel is prone to sudden
and extreme changes in weather

21:39.712 --> 21:43.819
that can quickly overwhelm
a 6-foot skiff.

21:43.854 --> 21:46.477
Brent:
It's crazy how quickly the
weather can change up here.

21:46.512 --> 21:49.169
It can be sunny at one moment
and then, within an hour,

21:49.204 --> 21:52.000
it could be dumping rain
or even blowing snow.

21:53.967 --> 21:57.039
This weather is looking
awfully moody right now.

really have another choice.
