00:13.200 --> 00:15.367
- Hey!
Go back to bed.

00:15.433 --> 00:18.000
You don't need to be up
for me to stretch canvases.

00:18.067 --> 00:19.867
- Oh, please,
some of my best art

00:19.933 --> 00:22.000
comes from
my worst hangovers.

00:22.067 --> 00:26.767
Here, wait.
Let me have this.

00:26.833 --> 00:28.200
Shit!

00:28.267 --> 00:30.233
Never drink absinthe
from a food truck.

00:30.300 --> 00:32.267
- How about I staple

00:32.333 --> 00:33.533
and you tell me
about Josh?

00:33.600 --> 00:35.033
- Josh?

00:35.100 --> 00:37.133
- You know,
super-hot tattoo guy.

00:37.200 --> 00:39.100
Wait, his name is Josh,
isn't it?

00:39.167 --> 00:40.700
He would've corrected me

00:40.767 --> 00:42.900
if I said the wrong name
during sex, right?

00:42.967 --> 00:45.000
- Wha--Please,
tell me you didn't.

00:45.067 --> 00:46.400
- Why?

00:46.467 --> 00:47.900
- He's Liza's ex.

00:47.967 --> 00:50.367
- Wait, Liza, like
your roommate, Liza?

00:50.433 --> 00:52.400
What?

00:52.467 --> 00:54.067
- Hey, good morning.
What you up to?

00:54.133 --> 00:56.133
- I banged your ex-boyfriend.
I'm sorry.

00:56.200 --> 00:58.267
- Okay.

00:58.333 --> 01:00.433
- She really
didn't know.

01:00.500 --> 01:02.200
- Of course not.

01:02.267 --> 01:04.200
- Oh, it's fine,
really.

01:04.267 --> 01:06.400
Bang away...

01:06.467 --> 01:08.667
like a screen door
in a hurricane.

01:08.733 --> 01:10.467
- Okay.
- Yeah, okay.

01:10.533 --> 01:12.633
I'm gonna go
to work now.

01:12.700 --> 01:15.667
Have a great day.

01:15.733 --> 01:19.200

01:19.267 --> 01:20.600
- Oh, shit.

01:20.667 --> 01:25.133
* *

01:25.200 --> 01:27.500
- If no one has
anything else,

01:27.567 --> 01:30.200
I have an announcement
to make.

01:30.267 --> 01:33.500
After a successful
early run,

01:33.567 --> 01:35.833
including a pair
of best sellers,

01:35.900 --> 01:38.067
Millennial
has quickly established itself

01:38.067 --> 01:40.167
as a major player.

01:40.233 --> 01:43.267
And while it is already
in excellent hands,

01:43.333 --> 01:46.433
we think its growth potential
is going to require

01:46.500 --> 01:48.433
another executive.

01:48.500 --> 01:51.067
So it is my great pleasure
to announce

01:51.067 --> 01:54.533
Millennial's new
associate editor...

01:54.600 --> 01:55.967
Liza Miller.

01:56.067 --> 01:59.633
- Oh, you guys.

01:59.700 --> 02:01.367
Did you do this?

02:01.433 --> 02:03.067
- We all agreed,
you're ready.

02:03.133 --> 02:04.567
- Oh.

02:04.633 --> 02:06.333
- Congratulations, Liza,

02:06.400 --> 02:07.867
and here are your new
business cards.

02:07.933 --> 02:09.733
- Ooh.
- Thank you.

02:09.800 --> 02:11.667
This is unbelievable.

02:11.733 --> 02:14.067
- What's unbelievable is
the work you've been doing

02:14.067 --> 02:15.367
on an assistant's salary.

02:15.433 --> 02:16.900
- I am just happy
to work here

02:16.967 --> 02:18.933
in whatever capacity
you'll have me.

02:19.067 --> 02:20.333
- We are so glad
to hear you say that.

02:20.400 --> 02:23.167
- There's a bit
of a catch.

02:23.233 --> 02:24.733
We're thrilled to
give you a raise

02:24.800 --> 02:27.933
and a title bump,
but we can't afford that

02:28.067 --> 02:29.400
and a new assistant
for Diana.

02:29.467 --> 02:32.067
- But for today,
we celebrate.

02:32.100 --> 02:33.867
- Yes. We'd like to
have you join us

02:33.933 --> 02:37.600
for our yearly wine and dine
with Belinda Lacroix.

02:37.667 --> 02:38.700
1:00 okay?

02:38.767 --> 02:40.567
- Of course.

02:40.633 --> 02:42.400
- Call the restaurant and change
the reservation to 4:00

02:42.467 --> 02:44.367
and make sure they know
about my dairy allergies.

02:44.433 --> 02:46.500
Congratulations.

02:46.567 --> 02:49.500
[upbeat music]

02:49.567 --> 02:54.933

02:55.067 --> 02:57.667
- Associate editor,
that's wonderful.

02:57.733 --> 02:59.267
We should have
champagne.

02:59.333 --> 03:01.533
- Why don't we work on
our sidecar first?

03:01.600 --> 03:05.400
- Always he scolds me about
drinking too much at lunch.

03:05.467 --> 03:07.600
Didn't bother you
when you were 15

03:07.667 --> 03:09.800
and stealing sips
of my whiskey.

03:09.867 --> 03:12.633
- 15? Belinda, how long
have you been at Empirical?

03:12.700 --> 03:13.900
- Many, many years.

03:13.967 --> 03:15.733
- Many prolific years.

03:15.800 --> 03:17.400
Belinda's been writing
a book a year for Empirical

03:17.467 --> 03:19.267
since the early 1970s.

03:19.333 --> 03:21.267
- Her romance novels kept
the lights on for a long time.

03:21.333 --> 03:23.067
Before Edward L.L. Moore,

03:23.133 --> 03:25.800
she was our biggest earner
for over a decade, right?

03:25.867 --> 03:28.300
- And I outlasted
that old pervert

03:28.367 --> 03:31.333
with his tales
of dragons and incest.

03:31.400 --> 03:33.067
Where's my Netflix deal?

03:33.067 --> 03:34.567
- No one can get past
the romance stigma.

03:34.633 --> 03:36.600
Snobs.

03:36.667 --> 03:39.067
- And that kind of snobbery is
just sexism in a tweed jacket.

03:39.133 --> 03:41.067
Men decide romance
is silly,

03:41.067 --> 03:44.067
and women feel embarrassed
about reading it.

03:44.067 --> 03:46.067
- What's so embarrassing
about a woman being a hero

03:46.133 --> 03:47.433
and having great sex?

03:47.500 --> 03:49.067
- You should be
a feminist icon.

03:49.067 --> 03:50.900
- Feminists!
Oh, goodness.

03:50.967 --> 03:53.067
They don't want anything to do
with my books either,

03:53.067 --> 03:54.567
at least not in public.

03:54.633 --> 03:55.933
- We're working hard
to change that.

03:56.067 --> 03:57.867
That's why I had
Liza join us.

03:57.933 --> 03:59.733
We are hoping to
introduce your novels

03:59.800 --> 04:02.400
to a new generation
of readers.

04:02.467 --> 04:04.533
- And I can't wait to
hear all about it,

04:04.600 --> 04:07.067
but might I have an escort
to the ladies' room?

04:07.133 --> 04:08.700
I can get down
just fine,

04:08.767 --> 04:12.067
but the--the getting up
can be melodramatic.

04:12.067 --> 04:14.967
- Why don't we have our new
associate editor do that?

04:15.067 --> 04:16.367
And then you two can get
to know each other better.

04:16.433 --> 04:17.467
- Of course.

04:17.533 --> 04:19.300
- Wonderful,
but we--

04:19.367 --> 04:21.067
we--we--we should
go quickly.

04:21.067 --> 04:23.267
- Right. Okay.

04:25.267 --> 04:28.500
- Uh, Diana and I have
some really fun ideas

04:28.567 --> 04:30.333
about this
upcoming book tour,

04:30.400 --> 04:31.867
if you're up for it.

04:31.933 --> 04:33.467
- Of course I am.

04:33.533 --> 04:36.700
My fans have become
my friends.

04:36.767 --> 04:38.500
Men come and go,

04:38.567 --> 04:40.533
but those women
in pink hats,

04:40.600 --> 04:41.933
they've gotten me
through a lot.

04:42.067 --> 04:43.633
- Yeah, I hear you.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.933
I don't know where I'd be
without my girlfriends.

04:46.067 --> 04:47.633
I mean, I wouldn't have
this job,

04:47.700 --> 04:50.600
and--and I wouldn't be
in New York.

04:50.667 --> 04:53.367
- Don't let all
the unrequited lust fool you.

04:53.433 --> 04:57.833
My books are about
women coming together

04:57.900 --> 05:00.867
to control their lives.

05:00.933 --> 05:01.933
- Hmm.

05:02.067 --> 05:03.267
- Men...
[coughs]

05:03.333 --> 05:04.600
Are just candy.

05:04.667 --> 05:06.067
- [laughing]

05:06.100 --> 05:07.333
- [laughs, breathes deeply]

05:07.400 --> 05:09.200
Oh.

05:11.333 --> 05:13.667
- Belinda?

05:16.967 --> 05:18.933
Belinda? Oh, my God!
Belinda!

05:19.067 --> 05:21.933
Oh, my God!

05:22.067 --> 05:23.633
Shoot.

05:25.667 --> 05:28.367
[siren wails]

05:28.433 --> 05:30.067
She was fine.
She was joking.

05:30.100 --> 05:32.600
And then she was
just gone.

05:32.667 --> 05:34.133
- I'm so sorry,
Charles.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.267
I know what she meant to
you and your family.

05:36.333 --> 05:39.467
- Did she--did she say
anything before she...?

05:39.533 --> 05:41.933
- The last thing
she said was,

05:42.067 --> 05:44.067
"Men are just candy."
- [chuckles]

05:44.100 --> 05:46.100
- It's a great
book title.

05:46.167 --> 05:49.100
[organ music]

05:49.167 --> 05:53.467
* *

05:53.533 --> 05:56.100
- Zadie Smith just bummed gum
from me in the ladies' room.

05:56.167 --> 05:59.567
- I just saw Danielle Steel
icing Janet Evanovich.

05:59.633 --> 06:01.767
It's like the who's who
of publishing here.

06:01.833 --> 06:04.600
- I hate wearing pink. It's
like Barbie's dream funeral.

06:04.667 --> 06:07.400
But it's what
Belinda wanted, so I--

06:07.467 --> 06:09.400
- That guy seems to be
pulling it off pretty well.

06:09.467 --> 06:11.633
- [chuckles]
That's Zane Anders.

06:11.700 --> 06:13.600
Rivington brought him in
to run their company.

06:13.667 --> 06:15.300
"Esquire" did
a profile on him.

06:15.367 --> 06:17.133
He has
a clothing allowance.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.800
- He's really
attractive.

06:18.867 --> 06:20.333
- Yeah. He knows.

06:20.400 --> 06:22.067
- Stop ogling
the competition.

06:22.067 --> 06:24.067
[gasps]
Barbara Walters.

06:24.067 --> 06:26.500
Barbara.

06:27.567 --> 06:29.100
- [scoffs]

06:29.167 --> 06:30.600
It's Lachlan Flynn.

06:30.667 --> 06:32.400
- The spy novelist?
- Yeah.

06:32.467 --> 06:34.067
I tore through all of his books
in high school.

06:34.133 --> 06:35.667
Is it weird
if I go introduce myself?

06:35.733 --> 06:37.533
- Diana's pretty much
on Barbara Walters' lap,

06:37.600 --> 06:38.600
so go for it.

06:38.667 --> 06:40.067
- Yeah, okay.

06:41.733 --> 06:45.300
Mr. Flynn. Hi, Kelsey Peters
with Millennial.

06:45.367 --> 06:46.933
- Hello.

06:47.067 --> 06:48.733
- I don't mean to fangirl
at a funeral,

06:48.800 --> 06:50.467
but I read your entire
Grant Stone series twice.

06:50.533 --> 06:51.967
- Really?

06:52.067 --> 06:53.500
Now, I didn't realize
girls even knew

06:53.567 --> 06:55.400
my books existed.

06:55.467 --> 06:58.300
- You might want to mention
that to your publisher.

06:58.367 --> 07:00.067
We're a huge part
of the market.

07:00.133 --> 07:01.867
- Good afternoon,
everyone.

07:01.933 --> 07:03.467
Thank you all
for coming,

07:03.533 --> 07:06.900
and thank you all
for showing your pink.

07:06.967 --> 07:09.600
[laughter]

07:09.667 --> 07:13.600
Belinda would be sorry
she missed that.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.400
I want to say a few words...

07:15.467 --> 07:17.133
- We should probably
take our seats.

07:17.200 --> 07:19.833
It was lovely
meeting you.

07:19.900 --> 07:21.800
- The Empirical family
for decades.

07:21.867 --> 07:24.800
[lively music]

07:24.867 --> 07:29.800
* *

07:29.867 --> 07:33.167
- So we just buried a woman
in a hot-pink coffin.

07:33.233 --> 07:34.800
I need a drink.

07:34.867 --> 07:36.733
- What, dressed
like this?

07:36.800 --> 07:39.567
It looks like we bailed halfway
through a breast cancer 10K.

07:39.633 --> 07:41.200
- Come on, shouldn't
that scare you

07:41.267 --> 07:43.067
into living life
to the fullest?

07:43.100 --> 07:45.067
You're 40.

07:45.133 --> 07:46.900
- 41, actually.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.600
Last week.
Kind of flew under the radar.

07:49.667 --> 07:51.233
- What?
- Well, I mean,

07:51.300 --> 07:53.467
we weren't in
a good place, so...

07:53.533 --> 07:55.567
- Right.

07:55.633 --> 07:58.833
- So are we in
a good place now?

07:58.900 --> 08:00.533
- Yeah.

08:00.600 --> 08:02.933
You did what you had
to do for your kid.

08:03.067 --> 08:05.200
I would like to think that
my mom would do something crazy

08:05.267 --> 08:07.767
like that for me.

08:07.833 --> 08:09.567
We're good.

08:09.633 --> 08:11.267
- Thank you.

08:11.333 --> 08:13.733
- Don't thank me. Come out
and get some birthday ass.

08:13.800 --> 08:17.433
- Birth--[laughs]
I-I'll pass on the ass.

08:17.500 --> 08:19.600
- Josh is moving on,
and so should you.

08:19.667 --> 08:22.067
That's what you do
after a nasty breakup.

08:22.067 --> 08:23.867
You got to clear the pipes.
- Ugh.

08:23.933 --> 08:25.733
- As long as he's
the last person you slept with,

08:25.800 --> 08:27.433
he'll be clogging your drain.
- That is disgusting.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.533
- Come on,
it's not bothering you

08:29.600 --> 08:33.667
that he's screwing a girl
that's working in your loft?

08:33.733 --> 08:35.133
- Okay, fine,
one drink.

08:35.200 --> 08:36.933
But no weird
hipster places

08:37.067 --> 08:38.667
where you have to walk
through a fake barbershop

08:38.733 --> 08:40.267
to get to the bar.

08:40.333 --> 08:42.233
- Don't worry, we'll go
to one of your places.

08:42.300 --> 08:45.133
- What does that mean?

08:46.667 --> 08:48.433
Old, that's what
you meant.

08:48.500 --> 08:50.733
- They're only old
to Work Liza.

08:50.800 --> 08:51.900
That guy at the bar,

08:51.967 --> 08:53.867
he's perfect
for Real Liza.

08:53.933 --> 08:55.467
He is hot.

08:55.533 --> 08:57.267
And he--he's totally
hitting on you.

08:57.333 --> 08:59.400
- Well, I'm not gonna hit back.
- Why?

08:59.467 --> 09:01.400
- Because I'm not getting
involved with anyone right now.

09:01.467 --> 09:03.233
- Who said anything
about getting involved?

09:03.300 --> 09:05.100
You don't have to go collecting
an engagement ring

09:05.167 --> 09:07.500
from every guy you sleep with.
Just smash and dash.

09:07.567 --> 09:09.200
- Okay, I think I'm too old
for both of those verbs.

Sorry I'm late.

all the pink?

Let's go blow it out.

Okay, listen, I need this.

09:21.467 --> 09:23.167
I am boo'd up,
and I am bored.

Max is great.

09:24.933 --> 09:27.067
- Um, is he?

09:27.100 --> 09:28.667
You guys, I've been tracking
my emotional journey

09:28.733 --> 09:30.400
through
this relationship,

09:30.467 --> 09:32.633
and my sticker system
shows it has been grim.

09:32.700 --> 09:33.733
- You have
a sticker system?

09:33.800 --> 09:35.533
- Mm-hmm, I do, yes.

09:35.600 --> 09:37.367
On the days Max makes me happy,
he gets a gold star.

09:37.433 --> 09:39.200
- And the red dots
are for when--

09:39.267 --> 09:41.233
- When he repulses me
and I want to rip off his beard.

09:41.300 --> 09:42.633
- Okay.
- Come on!

09:42.700 --> 09:44.467
Don't make
that face at me.

09:44.533 --> 09:47.733
Listen, Max's dull normalcy
was cute at first.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.167
It was, but, you guys, it has
chipped away at my edges,

09:50.233 --> 09:52.100
and now I'm dull
and I'm normal.

09:52.167 --> 09:55.967
Oh, my God, I'm sorry. Is this
an assisted-living facility?

09:56.067 --> 09:57.233
- Shh.
- What?

09:57.300 --> 09:58.733

doing here?

for a gay sleaze bar either.

dressed like a drag queen,

10:19.167 --> 10:20.100

the L on our way downtown.

I'll get home on my own.

10:29.533 --> 10:31.100
Thanks.

go home on your own.

That guy at the bar was
totally checking you out.

10:34.733 --> 10:36.500

- But you know

10:36.567 --> 10:39.333

10:57.467 --> 10:59.867
Oh, no, these
aren't costumes.

11:00.067 --> 11:01.267
We were at a funeral.

mocking a death.

It was in her will.

see him again.

Oh, my God, hi.

It's my stupid bullet journal.

grading me?

it doesn't mean anything.

It's just a silly,

I repulse you?

Okay, listen, this is about me.
Okay, this is not about you.
