<i>about my grade,
but I'll come back later.</i>

01:38.632 --> 01:40.225
Hold it, Cunningham!

01:40.367 --> 01:41.562
Now, why are you here?

01:41.702 --> 01:43.397
Well, sir, uh,

01:43.537 --> 01:46.029
about my grade
on my last assignment.

01:46.173 --> 01:48.300
This is my first
college journalism course,

01:48.442 --> 01:49.807
and you gave me a

01:49.943 --> 01:52.037
Now, I have never complained
about a grade before,

01:52.179 --> 01:53.408
but I-l just honestly felt

01:53.547 --> 01:54.776
that it deserved
better than a

01:54.915 --> 01:55.848
Is that a fact?

01:55.983 --> 01:57.348
Well, I suggest
you read it over again.

01:57.484 --> 01:58.576
Well, I did.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.482
It's got who, what, why,
where, when and how.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.612
It's got all the information
in the first paragraph.

02:02.756 --> 02:04.053
It-it's well-written,
and I just think that it

02:04.191 --> 02:05.886
-deserves a little better. I...
- Let me see that.

02:06.026 --> 02:07.960
Oh, yeah, I remember.

02:08.095 --> 02:10.359
Yeah, colorful,
good sentence structure.

02:10.497 --> 02:11.555
Then why did it get a "D"?

02:11.698 --> 02:12.825
What's the name of this course?

02:12.966 --> 02:14.991
The name, uh,
Investigative Reporting 101.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.193
That's right.

02:16.336 --> 02:18.134
Investigative Reporting.

02:18.271 --> 02:20.137
Cunningham, this story deals

02:20.273 --> 02:22.902
with a stoplight that has been
burned out for over a month.

02:23.043 --> 02:24.010
Right, right.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.407
It's a good subject.

02:25.545 --> 02:27.480
It hasn't been fixed;
people have been late to work.

02:27.614 --> 02:29.844
There have been traffic jams.
A city with no heart.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.952
Uh-huh, where's a quote
from the traffic commissioner?

02:32.085 --> 02:33.382
- Well, uh, I tried...
- What do the people

02:33.520 --> 02:34.544
in the neighborhood think?

02:34.688 --> 02:36.451
- The people, they...
- How about the police

02:36.590 --> 02:37.750
who cover the area?

02:37.891 --> 02:39.188
- The police...
- The school guard?

02:39.326 --> 02:41.761
How about a motorist
who's had a close call?

02:41.895 --> 02:43.590
How about
my colorful description

02:43.730 --> 02:45.130
of the light itself?

02:46.133 --> 02:47.396
Now, what's wrong with...

02:47.534 --> 02:49.662
"The fiery red glow,

02:49.803 --> 02:52.704
"which once flashed
like a one-eyed giant,

02:52.839 --> 02:55.832
now stands like a lonely,
silent sentinel."

02:55.976 --> 02:58.001
Who cares about one-eyed giants?

02:58.145 --> 03:00.375
Investigative reporting!

03:00.514 --> 03:02.641
If you want to write
about one-eyed giants,

03:02.783 --> 03:04.250
write for television.

03:04.384 --> 03:06.683
Oh, well, I see your point.

03:06.820 --> 03:07.981
Congratulations.

03:08.121 --> 03:09.111
I guess I didn't dig enough.

03:09.256 --> 03:10.223
That's right, Cunningham.

03:10.357 --> 03:12.223
Dig, dig, dig!

03:12.359 --> 03:13.588
- Dig...
- Right.

03:13.727 --> 03:16.253
Get down in the muck
and wallow, hunt,

03:16.396 --> 03:18.126
root around, ferret out.

03:18.265 --> 03:20.165
You don't do it this time,
Cunningham,

03:20.300 --> 03:21.768
you get another

03:21.902 --> 03:23.768
A A "D" in journalism.

03:23.904 --> 03:24.894
It's embarrassing.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.665
A "D" in my chosen field.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.434
L-I think I should just
forget it,

03:28.575 --> 03:30.202
go to work for Dad
at his hardware store.

03:30.343 --> 03:31.606
I mean, I know nuts and bolts

03:31.745 --> 03:33.645
and shingles and hacksaws
and things. I can do that.

03:33.780 --> 03:35.214
Oh, now, Richard,
you're talking silly.

03:35.348 --> 03:37.874
Professor Garrity
is an old fuddy-duddy.

03:38.018 --> 03:39.679
That's not what you said
about my Spanish teacher

03:39.820 --> 03:40.912
when I got a

03:41.054 --> 03:41.953
That was different.

03:42.089 --> 03:43.317
You deserved that,

03:43.457 --> 03:45.357
telling him that hasta Ia vista

03:45.492 --> 03:48.188
means "sit on it."

03:50.063 --> 03:52.464
Nobody understands
my sense of humor.

03:52.599 --> 03:54.124
Oh, boy, I got a

03:54.267 --> 03:56.566
How am I supposed to tell Dad
that I got a "D"

03:56.703 --> 03:58.637
when he's spending all
this money on going to college?

03:58.772 --> 03:59.796
Don't worry.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.305
We're gonna help you
find something

04:01.441 --> 04:03.410
to investigate right here.

04:03.543 --> 04:06.069
You're gonna show
that old codger

04:06.213 --> 04:08.147
what reporting is all about.

04:08.281 --> 04:11.342
Yeah. Here's something
for you to investigate, Rich.

04:11.485 --> 04:12.452
Oh, what?

04:12.586 --> 04:14.850
It says here that Desi and Lucy

04:14.988 --> 04:17.548
bought a home in Beverly Hills.

04:17.690 --> 04:18.783
Well, that's interesting.

04:18.925 --> 04:21.326
I wonder where
Fred and Ethel Mertz will live.

04:23.163 --> 04:24.562
Mom, you're not helping me.

04:24.698 --> 04:27.030
Here, give me a section
of this. I'll...

04:27.167 --> 04:28.600
I've got it.

04:28.735 --> 04:30.965
I'll borrow
Jenny Piccalo's diary.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.572
She's got great stories.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.936
She has four pages
about the time

04:35.075 --> 04:36.508
she got stuck
in the tunnel of love.

04:36.643 --> 04:39.044
I'm gonna call her;
this is great, this is great.

04:39.179 --> 04:40.544
No, no good.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.615

04:58.198 --> 04:59.688
Good evening, dear.

04:59.833 --> 05:00.800
How was your day?

05:00.934 --> 05:03.960
I had a lousy day,
thank you, Marion.

05:04.104 --> 05:06.402
Better tell him
about the "D" later.

05:06.540 --> 05:09.907
Oh, I'm sorry about your day,
dear, but cheer up.

05:10.043 --> 05:12.102
I have a pot roast for dinner.

05:12.245 --> 05:14.179
Now, does that make you
feel better?

05:14.314 --> 05:15.611
No.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.909
With little carrots
in the gravy?

05:19.953 --> 05:21.079
Yes.

05:21.221 --> 05:23.121
Well, it's a start.

05:23.256 --> 05:25.156
Oh, what's the trouble, dear?

05:25.292 --> 05:28.557
Are your feather dusters
molting again?

05:28.695 --> 05:29.958
No, Marion.

05:30.096 --> 05:31.394
It's the garbagemen.

05:31.531 --> 05:33.727
They are demanding a surcharge.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.130
A surcharge?

05:35.268 --> 05:37.362
How dare they.

05:37.504 --> 05:40.200
What exactly is that?

05:40.340 --> 05:42.104
I'll tell you
what it is, Marion.

05:42.242 --> 05:45.234
They are demanding extra money
every week

05:45.378 --> 05:46.505
to pick up the trash.

05:46.646 --> 05:48.546
Now, Richard,
they call that a surcharge.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.411
You know what I call it?
Bullying me!

05:50.550 --> 05:52.917
- Extortion!
- Extortion?

05:53.053 --> 05:54.145
Well, you know
what they say, dear.

05:54.287 --> 05:55.755
You can't fight city hall.

05:55.889 --> 05:57.482
Fight city hall.

05:57.624 --> 05:59.023
City hall.

05:59.159 --> 06:01.059
This may be it;
this may be my story.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.389
He wants me to dig.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.258
Well, what's better to dig in
than garbage?

06:04.397 --> 06:06.889
Oh, boy.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.330
I'm really cooking now.

06:08.468 --> 06:10.835
I'm cooking with gas.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.734
What is he talking about?

06:12.873 --> 06:14.636
I'm Scoop Cunningham, Dad.

06:14.774 --> 06:16.504
I got an important story,
and you can really help me.

06:16.643 --> 06:17.769
All right, now, uh,

06:17.911 --> 06:19.970
who told you
about this so-called surcharge?

06:20.113 --> 06:21.513
The regular garbagemen.

06:21.648 --> 06:23.116
Yeah, uh, what are their names?

06:23.250 --> 06:24.547
Names?

06:24.684 --> 06:26.653
I don't know their names.

06:26.786 --> 06:28.049
Well, what do you call them?

06:28.188 --> 06:30.623
Well, they're trying
to get money out of me, Marion!

06:30.757 --> 06:32.384
I call them crooks!

06:32.525 --> 06:34.756
Well, is there anything
you can tell me about them?

06:34.895 --> 06:36.123
Well, what's to tell?

06:36.263 --> 06:37.890
They pick up my trashcans,

06:38.031 --> 06:39.590
they throw the trash
into the trucks,

06:39.733 --> 06:41.223
and then they run over my lids.

06:42.702 --> 06:44.693
What a story.

06:45.905 --> 06:48.306
Running over lids?

06:48.441 --> 06:51.070
Richard, what is the matter
with you?

06:51.211 --> 06:54.738
Dad, I got a "D"
on my journalism assignment,

06:54.881 --> 06:56.611
but don't worry,
that's not gonna happen again.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.775
This is gonna be
a great story, Dad.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.216
(door closes)

07:00.353 --> 07:02.447
He got a

07:02.589 --> 07:05.251
Only Joanie gets "D"s.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.526
I got a

07:18.071 --> 07:19.505
You think you got troubles.

07:19.639 --> 07:21.403
I'm doing so bad in ROTC,

07:21.541 --> 07:23.737
they're talking firing squad.

07:23.877 --> 07:26.141
They won't do that.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.145
In the Navy,
they walk the plank.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.908
-(chuckles)
- Good one, Malph.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.017
I Still got it.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.812
Every year, I get better.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.353
Hey, Pots, I missed some
of the biology notes.

07:35.488 --> 07:36.512
- Can I see yours?
- Yeah.

That's it?

07:47.267 --> 07:50.032
Yeah, that's when Linda Shanley
crossed her legs.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.036
Hmm.

07:52.172 --> 07:54.106
Come on, let's go find somebody
we can get the notes from.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.333
Okay.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.000
- Hey, Rich. -Hey, Rich.
- Hi, guys.

07:57.143 --> 07:58.406
Oh, Rich, we missed some
of the biology notes.

07:58.545 --> 07:59.774
I have no time for kid stuff.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.881
I've got big business over here.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.574
He didn't get them, either.

08:03.717 --> 08:05.912
Right.
Let's go find Linda Shanley.

08:06.052 --> 08:07.577
What if she doesn't have
the notes?

08:07.721 --> 08:09.712
BOTH:
We'll look at her legs!

08:11.191 --> 08:12.784
Is that right? (chuckles)

08:12.926 --> 08:14.826
Al, Al, please,
I have to have the phone.

08:14.961 --> 08:16.019
I'm waiting
for an important call

08:16.162 --> 08:17.095
from the Department
of Sanitation.

08:17.230 --> 08:18.163
I've got to have it.

08:18.298 --> 08:20.266
But this is it;
it's Mrs. Miller.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.027
- Mrs. Miller...
- She belongs to my parish.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.228
Yeah, Mrs. Miller,

08:24.371 --> 08:26.703
did you know I have a brother
that's a priest?

08:26.840 --> 08:28.103
- Uh-huh.
- Al, Al, please.

08:28.241 --> 08:30.300
- Well, look, I got to go
right now. -Al, please.

08:30.443 --> 08:32.241
Here's Richard Cunningham

08:32.379 --> 08:34.506
Boy, could you believe?
Small world.

08:34.647 --> 08:35.671
Yeah.

08:35.815 --> 08:37.078
Hello. Yes.

08:37.217 --> 08:38.844
Yes, this is Richie Cunningham.

08:38.985 --> 08:40.385
Yeah, oh, well, now...

08:40.520 --> 08:42.818
Oh, yeah, yeah,
Al is a nice guy.

08:42.956 --> 08:45.254
Right, now,
about the commissioner.

08:45.392 --> 08:46.689
Well, look,
I know the commissioner

08:46.826 --> 08:48.761
doesn't want to talk to me,
but, Mrs. Miller...

08:48.895 --> 08:51.592
Mrs. Miller, please, I would
just like to talk to you.

08:51.731 --> 08:54.564
Please, if you can't set up
an appointment...

08:54.701 --> 08:56.066
Please, Mrs. Miller, all right.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.068
Let me take you out to dinner,
lunch, anything.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.934
I just...
I just have to talk to you.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.404
- Mrs. Miller, ple...
-(click)

09:01.541 --> 09:03.373
(groans)

09:05.145 --> 09:06.078
She hung up.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.408
As well she should.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.277
You don't fool around
with married women.

09:10.417 --> 09:13.113
I find that
personally disgraceful.

09:13.253 --> 09:15.085
Oh, no, that's-that's not
a married woman, Fonz.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.019
- Uh-huh.
- Well, yeah, she is married,

09:17.157 --> 09:18.818
but she's from Al's parish,
and she...

09:18.958 --> 09:21.188
Well, look, don't worry
about her, Fonz.

09:21.327 --> 09:24.058
Look, I'm doing this expose
on the Sanitation Department.

09:24.197 --> 09:25.494
Now, I've got some
very good leads,

09:25.632 --> 09:28.123
but I just can't get anybody
to confirm anything.

09:28.268 --> 09:30.134
Oh, I get it. What you need is,

09:30.270 --> 09:32.204
uh, to know somebody
down at city hall.

09:32.338 --> 09:33.499
That's what I need!

09:33.640 --> 09:35.506
No, what you need
is to let my arm go.

09:35.642 --> 09:36.871
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:37.010 --> 09:40.275
But, uh, do you know anybody
down at city hall?

09:40.413 --> 09:42.848
Let's see, city hall,
yeah, there's, uh...

09:42.982 --> 09:45.144
Cecilia, Belvy,

09:45.285 --> 09:46.878
uh, Marilyn.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.817
- Uh, Fonz, uh...
- Yeah, there's, uh,

09:48.955 --> 09:50.423
-would you step over here?
- Lorraine,

09:50.557 --> 09:52.252
- Bunny,
- Not so loud, Fonz.

09:52.392 --> 09:55.259
- Sharon, Ellen.
- That's gonna be plenty.

09:55.395 --> 09:56.863
Boy, it's great to know somebody
with friends

09:56.996 --> 09:58.464
-in the right places.
- Yeah.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.123
Sally, Rachel...

10:00.266 --> 10:02.963
Fonz, I need somebody
on the inside.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.537
Marsha.

10:05.672 --> 10:08.232
I need somebody in the know
with all the info.

10:08.374 --> 10:10.741
I am gonna rip the lid
off city hall, Fonz.

10:10.877 --> 10:12.845
Rip, rip, rip.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.541
I get your drift.

10:15.682 --> 10:17.582
Rip.

10:17.717 --> 10:20.550
What you need
is a chatty garbageman.

10:20.687 --> 10:21.813
(chuckles)
Right.

10:21.955 --> 10:22.979
Let's find one and chat.

10:23.122 --> 10:24.090
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.851
This takes time.

10:25.992 --> 10:28.290
Yes, but the assignment
is due tomorrow morning.

10:28.428 --> 10:30.089
I'll see what I can do.

10:30.230 --> 10:31.595
This is great.

10:31.731 --> 10:35.190
I could blow in a chick's ear
without ever moving my head.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.101
Yeah.

10:47.247 --> 10:48.805
Come on,
we'll be late for school

10:48.948 --> 10:51.042
-and miss Parents Night.
- We're coming, we're coming.

10:51.184 --> 10:53.152
I'm so glad Lori Beth came by.

10:53.286 --> 10:54.879
Richard needs something
to help him

10:55.021 --> 10:56.318
get his mind
off this garbage business.

10:56.456 --> 10:58.754
You want me to get
Jenny Piccalo to try?

10:58.892 --> 11:00.325
That's enough, young lady. Out.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.155
Out.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.923
You know her teacher's gonna
tell us she's got a fresh mouth.

11:05.064 --> 11:06.657
(groans)

11:06.799 --> 11:07.926
<i>LORI BETH:
Richie?</i>

11:08.067 --> 11:09.057
<i>RICHIE:
Yeah, Lori Beth?</i>

11:09.202 --> 11:10.692
Aren't you glad I came over

11:10.837 --> 11:12.532
to study with you, Rich?

11:12.672 --> 11:14.197
Oh, oh, yeah.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.331
Yeah, I really am. Yes.

11:19.546 --> 11:22.913
Well, here we are,
all alone in the house.

11:23.049 --> 11:25.313
-(chuckles)
- Hmm.

11:25.451 --> 11:27.579
You want to play some records?

11:27.720 --> 11:28.983
Hmm.

11:29.122 --> 11:30.851
Romantic records?

11:30.990 --> 11:32.083
Records!

11:32.225 --> 11:33.749
Records, that's it!

11:33.893 --> 11:35.657
If I can get hold of the
Sanitation Department records,

11:35.795 --> 11:37.525
I think I could really nail
those guys.

11:37.664 --> 11:38.892
Do you know what it's like

11:39.032 --> 11:40.795
playing second fiddle
to garbage?

11:40.934 --> 11:43.061
I'm sorry, Lori Beth,

11:43.202 --> 11:45.569
but, you see, even though
this is just a class assignment,

11:45.705 --> 11:46.866
if it's a good story,

11:47.006 --> 11:48.770
Professor Garrity might put it
in the school paper.

11:48.908 --> 11:51.434
And if it's a really good
investigative reporting job,

11:51.578 --> 11:53.637
it might even go in the...
in the Milwaukee Journal.

11:53.780 --> 11:54.906
(knocking)

11:55.048 --> 11:56.072
Wonder who that could be.

11:56.215 --> 11:57.376
I thought
we were gonna be alone.

11:59.519 --> 12:02.454
Is this the Cunningham house?

12:02.589 --> 12:03.851
Yeah, it is.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.288
Here's a present
for your old man.

12:07.427 --> 12:10.954
It's from his friends
at the Sanitation Department.

12:14.100 --> 12:15.693
(clears throat)

12:17.303 --> 12:19.636
Okay, bucko, the joke's over.

12:24.611 --> 12:28.570
You tell your old man
the joke is gonna be on him

12:28.715 --> 12:30.706
unless he calls off the snoops.

12:38.791 --> 12:39.952
You're the snoops.

12:40.093 --> 12:40.992
Yeah.

12:41.127 --> 12:42.492
That man hurt me
with his finger.

12:42.629 --> 12:44.620
Aw!

12:52.639 --> 12:55.130
Well, that's the best we can do.

12:55.274 --> 12:57.971
(groans) I'll shampoo
the rug in the morning.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.739
What a mess.
What a terrible thing.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.245
<i>.53“?
“mm?</i>

13:02.382 --> 13:03.713
Look, I didn't want
to worry Mom.

13:03.850 --> 13:05.647
But they left you a note.

13:05.785 --> 13:06.650
Oh?

13:06.786 --> 13:08.777
On this.

13:10.189 --> 13:12.055
"Cunningham, keep your nose

13:12.191 --> 13:14.786
"out of our business or...

13:14.927 --> 13:16.919
or you'll get your can kicked."

13:18.931 --> 13:20.900
Well.

13:21.034 --> 13:23.093
Guess we better forget
about the whole matter now.

13:23.236 --> 13:25.432
Oh, so you think
we just better

13:25.571 --> 13:27.437
let the whole thing die,
is that it?

13:27.573 --> 13:29.667
Yeah, I don't want
to see my dad getting hurt.

13:29.809 --> 13:30.776
Richard?

13:30.910 --> 13:32.139
Exposing an extortionist

13:32.278 --> 13:34.212
is much more important
than getting kicked.

13:34.347 --> 13:37.146
Besides, nobody kicks
Howard Cunningham's can

13:37.283 --> 13:39.081
without getting kicked back!

13:39.218 --> 13:40.151
Oh.

13:40.286 --> 13:41.276
Yeah, but-but, Dad?

13:41.421 --> 13:42.888
Dad, you didn't see this guy.

13:43.022 --> 13:44.922
I mean, this guy was... he...

13:45.058 --> 13:46.992
And he was...
And up here, nothing.

13:47.126 --> 13:48.617
Absolutely nothing at all.

13:48.761 --> 13:50.195
He was wide and...

13:50.329 --> 13:51.558
what a poker he had.

13:51.698 --> 13:53.222
It was...

13:53.366 --> 13:55.596
Who cares, Richard?!

13:55.735 --> 13:58.761
I mean, first,
it was the tea tax in Boston,

13:58.905 --> 14:01.635
and now it's the garbage tax
in Milwaukee.

14:01.774 --> 14:03.572
Tell me something:
Are you digging into this mess

14:03.710 --> 14:05.234
just to get
a good grade in school,

14:05.378 --> 14:06.971
or are you really
trying for justice?

14:07.113 --> 14:08.876
L-I'm trying for justice.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.312
Truth and justice.

14:12.151 --> 14:15.212
Psst. Come here.

14:15.354 --> 14:17.721
What's the matter
with his mouth?

14:17.857 --> 14:19.325
I got an informant.

14:19.459 --> 14:22.360
Oh, nothing, Dad.
That's just the way we talk now.

14:22.495 --> 14:23.860
Can we trust him?

14:23.996 --> 14:26.056
I'm his father.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.598
Right.
Besides, he already knows.

14:27.734 --> 14:28.860
And look over there, Fonz.

14:32.238 --> 14:35.071
Somebody threatened your can?

14:40.747 --> 14:42.612
Let me tell you something.

14:42.749 --> 14:44.011
We're gonna crack this case.
You understand?

14:44.150 --> 14:45.310
I got a plan.

14:45.451 --> 14:46.919
What is it, Fonz?

14:47.053 --> 14:48.350
All right.

14:48.488 --> 14:49.546
Ralph and Potsie's apartment.

14:49.689 --> 14:51.157
You be there 11:00.

14:51.290 --> 14:53.259
I'll have the informant there.

14:53.392 --> 14:55.020
Alone. Be there alone.

14:55.161 --> 14:57.562
All right. Oh, Fonz?

14:57.697 --> 14:59.790
What if Ralph and Potsie
are doing something?

14:59.932 --> 15:01.867
What are those two
gonna be doing?

15:04.036 --> 15:05.163
<i>RALPH:
Okay, girls.</i>

15:05.304 --> 15:07.534
<i>Sefior Potsie will now sing.</i>

15:07.673 --> 15:08.697
(knocking)

15:08.841 --> 15:09.934
(high-pitched):
Uh, someone's at the door.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.874
- Come in.
- Please!

15:12.011 --> 15:14.002
Oh, oh, hello, everybody.

15:14.147 --> 15:16.115
Look, I'm sorry
to break up all the fun,

15:16.249 --> 15:17.682
but I got...

15:17.817 --> 15:19.114
What are you guys doing?

15:19.252 --> 15:20.185
Hi, Rich.

15:20.319 --> 15:22.481
Oh, no.
Not the ventriloquist bit.

15:22.622 --> 15:24.180
Uh, okay, look.
I got to talk to you.

15:24.323 --> 15:25.484
Come on, please,
Ralph, Potsie, come on.

15:25.625 --> 15:26.853
I have to talk
to you right away.

15:26.993 --> 15:28.017
All right, all right, talk.

15:28.161 --> 15:29.059
Don't go away, girls.

15:29.195 --> 15:31.186
We got a big finish!

15:32.999 --> 15:35.934
Rich, telephone operators!

15:36.068 --> 15:38.628
Ring-a-ding-ding.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.466
Oh, right, right.
"Ring-a-ding-ding."

15:40.606 --> 15:42.404
Look, I need
a favor from you guys.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.271
I got to have
your apartment right away.

15:44.410 --> 15:45.935
Got a hot one, huh, Rich?

15:46.078 --> 15:47.569
Hey, Pots, look!

15:47.713 --> 15:50.308
She lets him take pictures!

15:50.449 --> 15:52.577
No kidding?!

15:52.718 --> 15:54.448
Oh, yeah, it is a hot one, yeah.

15:54.587 --> 15:57.215
P-Pictures, uh, tape recordings,
the whole bit.

15:57.356 --> 15:58.551
No!

15:58.691 --> 16:00.022
(laughs)
Yeah!

16:00.159 --> 16:01.786
BOTH:
Ooh!

16:01.928 --> 16:03.122
Lori Beth!

16:03.262 --> 16:04.787
Oh, no, it's not Lori Beth.

16:04.931 --> 16:05.829
(both groan)

16:05.965 --> 16:07.126
No. No, it's a new girl.

16:07.266 --> 16:09.292
But I have to be
alone with her, okay?

16:09.435 --> 16:11.267
Sounds good to us.

16:11.404 --> 16:12.928
Where you going, girls?

16:13.072 --> 16:14.335
You haven't seen
the end of the act yet.

16:14.473 --> 16:15.600
Oh, yes, we have.

16:15.741 --> 16:16.606
We'll see you.

16:16.742 --> 16:18.506
Don't call us. We'll call you.

16:18.644 --> 16:19.805
Wait a minute, wait a minute!

16:19.946 --> 16:21.277
You're missing the best part!

16:21.414 --> 16:25.316
I was gonna turn Senor Potsie's
head completely around!

16:26.686 --> 16:28.916
You can show us on the way home.

16:30.389 --> 16:31.914
Completely around?

16:32.058 --> 16:33.616
It won't hurt.

16:33.759 --> 16:34.692
Just kidding, Pots.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.022
Take care of the girls.

16:36.162 --> 16:38.961
Rich, you're amazing!
Tape recorders, cameras!

16:39.098 --> 16:41.590
Who would've thought--
Richie Cunningham a weirdo?

16:41.734 --> 16:43.725
(scoffs)

16:46.672 --> 16:47.799
Weirdo?

16:47.940 --> 16:49.306
Chachi, what are you doing here?

16:49.442 --> 16:50.966
- I live in the building,
remember? -Oh.

16:51.110 --> 16:52.236
What are you doing here?

16:52.378 --> 16:53.368
Well, I need the apartment.

16:53.512 --> 16:54.639
I have to be alone with someone.

16:54.780 --> 16:55.873
Say no more, Rich.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.312
I'm a man of the world.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.850
You know, you're lucky
I got here before she did.

16:59.986 --> 17:01.510
I got just what you need.

17:01.654 --> 17:05.488
Chachi's You Can Make Out
on the First Date Kit.

17:05.625 --> 17:06.990
Yeah, she's gonna be here
any second, Chachi.

17:07.126 --> 17:08.150
- I don't have time to...
- The kit contains

17:08.294 --> 17:09.659
an empty wine bottle.

17:09.795 --> 17:11.194
With a candle in it.

17:11.329 --> 17:12.525
Very romantic.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.155
She's not the
"candle in the bottle" type.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.858
- Now, would you go...?
- And it also contains

17:16.002 --> 17:17.992
<i>Chachfs Special Books
of Sweet Nothings</i>

17:18.137 --> 17:19.969
<i>to Whisper in Her Ears.</i>

17:20.106 --> 17:21.164
Two volumes.

17:21.307 --> 17:22.205
Yeah, two volumes.

17:22.340 --> 17:23.502
One for each ear.

17:23.643 --> 17:24.632
She's hard of hearing.

17:24.777 --> 17:26.074
Now, would you get out of here?!

17:26.212 --> 17:27.941
And it also contains a dime.

17:28.079 --> 17:29.912
A dime? Why a dime?

17:30.049 --> 17:32.950
If you get tired, call me.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.210
Yeah, yeah.

17:35.354 --> 17:36.788
Ralph would love that.

17:36.923 --> 17:38.914
Come on, will you hit the road?

17:39.992 --> 17:42.018
Hi, Fonz.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.554
Wah, wah, wah.

17:48.234 --> 17:49.531
Will you please get out of here?

17:49.669 --> 17:51.398
I got some, uh,
private business.

17:51.537 --> 17:54.097
Boy, can't sell
anything tonight.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.708
Must be the recession.

17:55.841 --> 17:57.241
So long, Fonz.

17:57.376 --> 18:00.107
So long, lady I'm dying to meet.

18:00.246 --> 18:02.044
Wah, wah, wah...

18:07.353 --> 18:08.320
Uh, Fonz?

18:08.454 --> 18:10.081
Is this, uh...?
(clears throat)

18:10.222 --> 18:11.588
Uh, yeah.
Excuse me for a minute.

18:11.724 --> 18:13.954
I'll be right back, my sweet.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.288
Fonz, is this the informant?

18:15.428 --> 18:17.396
Because if it is,
I'm glad I brought my camera.

18:17.530 --> 18:18.656
This is no informant.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.425
And you can't take a camera.

18:20.566 --> 18:21.727
Will you please put this down?

18:21.867 --> 18:23.733
Don't you know anything
about informing?

18:23.869 --> 18:25.235
This is on the QT.

18:25.371 --> 18:26.702
Oh, it's my first time.
I'm sorry.

18:26.839 --> 18:27.806
Look.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.670
Your informant
will be in the alley.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.037
- Huh?
- You won't speak to him.

18:31.177 --> 18:32.144
You won't see him.

18:32.278 --> 18:34.178
All you'll see
is his silhouette.

18:34.313 --> 18:36.805
Oh, that's a great idea.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.850
Well, I got the idea
from Clarice over here.

18:39.986 --> 18:41.817
You see, I was just
walking down the street,

18:41.954 --> 18:45.481
and I look up at this shade,
and there she was.

18:45.624 --> 18:47.422
Oh.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.392
She must cast some shadow.

18:49.528 --> 18:52.225
I'll tell you,
she barely fit on that shade.

18:52.365 --> 18:53.957
(chuckling)

18:54.100 --> 18:55.863
RICHIE:
All right, okay.

18:56.002 --> 18:57.060
So, I'm gonna talk to him

18:57.203 --> 18:58.170
-through the window, right?
- Wrong.

18:58.304 --> 18:59.169
There's no talking.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.296
Get up here.

19:01.440 --> 19:03.466
He's going to hit
the garbage cans.

19:03.609 --> 19:05.168
Once for yes, twice for no.

19:05.311 --> 19:06.210
You got that?

19:06.345 --> 19:07.278
Oh, that's very clever.

19:07.413 --> 19:08.539
That way, I can't
indentify his...

19:08.681 --> 19:09.739
his voice in court or anything.

19:09.882 --> 19:10.815
You got to protect them.

19:10.950 --> 19:11.815
- It's import...
- Cunningham?

19:11.951 --> 19:12.816
Well, it is very clever.

19:12.952 --> 19:13.817
All right, are you ready?

19:13.953 --> 19:14.943
Yes, I am.

19:24.330 --> 19:26.162
(clears throat)

19:26.298 --> 19:28.460
Uh, excuse me, stranger.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.501
Be right with you.

19:30.636 --> 19:32.627
Yeah?

19:34.540 --> 19:36.167
Fonzie, this is Al.

19:36.308 --> 19:37.173
That's right, it's Al.

19:37.309 --> 19:38.538
You want somebody who knows.

19:38.677 --> 19:39.804
Al knows.

19:39.945 --> 19:41.811
Al? How does he know
anything about the...?

19:41.947 --> 19:43.677
Oh, you're right.
I got you. Don't ask.

19:43.816 --> 19:45.045
FONZIE:
Okay.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.949
I'm gonna, uh, do a little
investigating myself.

19:48.087 --> 19:50.715
However,
I ain't gonna report it.

19:52.358 --> 19:53.416
Adios, amigos.

19:53.559 --> 19:54.492
Right.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.652
Whoa!

19:56.796 --> 19:58.787
Thanks, Fonz!

20:01.033 --> 20:03.468
(clears throat)

20:03.602 --> 20:05.798
All right, uh, Mr. Informant?

20:05.938 --> 20:08.134
Let's see, it's, uh, uh,

20:08.274 --> 20:10.538
once for yes,
twice for no, right?

20:10.676 --> 20:11.575
(bangs once)

20:11.710 --> 20:12.575
Oh, good.

20:12.711 --> 20:13.906
Uh, can you hear me okay?

20:14.046 --> 20:15.377
(bangs once)

20:15.514 --> 20:17.039
Fine. I can hear you good, too.

20:17.183 --> 20:18.275
All right.

20:18.417 --> 20:19.282
Hmm.

20:19.418 --> 20:21.910
Uh, here's the first question.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.887
Is it someone higher up
in the Sanitation Department

20:25.024 --> 20:26.821
who's getting the kickbacks
from the garbagemen?

20:26.959 --> 20:28.450
(bangs once)

20:28.594 --> 20:31.689
Oh, it is. And-and everybody's
afraid to talk, right?

20:31.831 --> 20:33.264
-(bangs once)
- I knew it!

20:33.399 --> 20:34.696
What is it? Is it the mob?

20:34.834 --> 20:36.426
Oh, what a scoop that would be.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.162
Al Capone, Lucky Luciano.

20:38.304 --> 20:39.430
I'm really hot now.

20:39.572 --> 20:40.800
(bangs twice)

20:40.940 --> 20:41.907
Oh, right. Not that hot.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.474
Okay, uh...

20:43.609 --> 20:44.940
All right.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.478
One, one person

20:47.613 --> 20:49.206
keeps cropping up.

20:49.348 --> 20:50.873
The dispatcher.

20:51.016 --> 20:52.279
Is he the one?

20:52.418 --> 20:53.442
(bangs once)

20:53.586 --> 20:54.610
He is! He's the one!

20:54.753 --> 20:55.618
I knew it! All right.

20:55.754 --> 20:57.279
Al, how can I prove it?

20:57.423 --> 21:00.449
There's only one thing
you can do, Richie.

21:08.367 --> 21:10.461
You knew it was me, didn't you?

21:10.603 --> 21:12.662
- Well, yeah, I-l did.
- Oh, boy.

21:12.805 --> 21:15.137
Now my cousin the garbageman's
gonna get in a lot of trouble

21:15.274 --> 21:16.969
-for telling me about it.
- No, he won't!

21:17.109 --> 21:18.941
No, a reporter's sources
are sacred.

21:19.078 --> 21:19.840
Are you sure?

21:19.979 --> 21:21.913
I'm positive.

21:22.047 --> 21:23.310
All right, listen.

21:23.449 --> 21:25.281
There's a new dispatcher
on your father's route.

21:25.417 --> 21:27.079
He worked this racket before.

21:27.219 --> 21:29.245
Just ask him
where he got his motorboat.

21:29.388 --> 21:30.685
Motorboat?

21:30.823 --> 21:32.484
- Yeah, the summerhouse.
- Summerhouse?

21:32.625 --> 21:33.683
And a dishwasher.

21:33.826 --> 21:34.918
A di... Well, Al.

21:35.060 --> 21:36.585
A lot of people
have dishwashers.

21:36.729 --> 21:38.959
One that cooks and makes beds?

21:39.098 --> 21:41.624
No, kidding.
He's got a maid, too?

21:41.767 --> 21:43.497
-(shushes)
- Oh, boy, I tell you.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.433
I'm gonna show him
Investigative Reporting 101.

21:45.571 --> 21:46.970
This is fantastic, Al.

21:47.106 --> 21:48.733
Rich, wait, someone's coming.
I got to get out of here!

21:48.874 --> 21:49.966
All right, thanks a lot!

21:50.109 --> 21:51.736
Oh, boy!

21:51.877 --> 21:53.106
I got to write
all this stuff down.

21:53.245 --> 21:54.838
This is fantastic.

22:26.011 --> 22:27.502
Professor Garrity?

22:27.646 --> 22:29.478
Uh, you wanted to talk to me?

22:29.615 --> 22:31.140
Wanted to talk to you? Ha!

22:31.283 --> 22:32.979
I'll tell the world
I wanted to talk to you!

22:33.118 --> 22:34.017
Come over here!

22:34.153 --> 22:35.746
You know what's been happening?

22:35.888 --> 22:37.287
I've been on the phone
for the last half hour

22:37.423 --> 22:38.981
with the sanitation
commissioner!

22:39.124 --> 22:40.888
The commissioner?
He has no reason to call you...

22:41.026 --> 22:42.824
The district attorney's office
has been yelling at me!

22:42.962 --> 22:45.021
The Better Business Bureau!
The mayor's office!

22:45.164 --> 22:46.859
- All yelling!
-(groans)

22:46.999 --> 22:48.865
- I'm sorry, I...
- Sorry?!

22:49.001 --> 22:50.161
I love it!

22:50.302 --> 22:52.100
That's newspapering.
(laughs)

22:52.238 --> 22:53.569
Really?

22:53.706 --> 22:54.832
You-you love it?

22:54.974 --> 22:57.067
Cunningham, you murdered them!

22:57.209 --> 22:58.233
(laughs)

22:58.377 --> 23:00.106
You nailed them to the wall.

23:00.246 --> 23:02.942
The dispatcher had to resign
to avoid prosecution.

23:03.082 --> 23:04.515
(both laugh)

23:04.650 --> 23:08.143
Cunningham, you took the stink
out of Milwaukee's garbage.

23:08.287 --> 23:09.254
I love it!

23:09.388 --> 23:10.913
Oh, gee! We murdered 'em.

23:11.056 --> 23:12.717
Think of the grade
I'm gonna get now.

23:12.858 --> 23:14.656
You got a

23:14.793 --> 23:16.056
A "B"?

23:16.195 --> 23:18.459
For taking the stink
out of Milwaukee's garbage?

23:18.597 --> 23:20.463
Cunningham, you did a great job.

23:20.599 --> 23:22.192
But I know you can do better.

23:22.334 --> 23:25.429
And I don't want to ever see
you relax and sit back, no.

23:25.571 --> 23:27.539
If you keep on the way you are,
you're gonna make something

23:27.673 --> 23:29.232
there's darn few of.

23:29.375 --> 23:31.571
A real newspaperman.

23:46.792 --> 23:48.055
Richard?

23:48.193 --> 23:49.923
Your mother told me
what a good job you did

23:50.062 --> 23:51.587
with that story,
and I just want you to know

23:51.730 --> 23:52.891
how proud I am of you.

23:53.032 --> 23:54.465
Well, I'm proud of you, Dad.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.033
There aren't too many fathers
who'd put their can

23:56.168 --> 23:57.829
on the line for their son's
newspaper story.

23:57.970 --> 23:58.835
Hmm.

23:58.971 --> 24:00.336
You're really something special.

24:00.472 --> 24:01.337
Ah!

24:01.473 --> 24:02.338
LORI BETH:
Aw.

24:02.474 --> 24:03.806
Thanks, son.

24:03.942 --> 24:05.843
Oh, hello, Lori Beth, Richard.

24:05.978 --> 24:07.673
Hurry, Howard.
We don't want to be late.

24:07.813 --> 24:09.941
Have fun with your homework.

24:10.082 --> 24:12.414
We will.

24:12.551 --> 24:15.487
Isn't it nice how they do their
homework together every night?

24:15.621 --> 24:16.713
Mm-hmm.

24:18.424 --> 24:20.790
Leave the lights on,
will you, Richard?

24:20.926 --> 24:22.792
RICHIE:
Okay, we'll leave the lights on.

24:22.928 --> 24:24.862
Yeah, good night, kids.

24:24.997 --> 24:26.863
Stop worrying about him, Howard.

24:26.999 --> 24:28.694
Richard's a good student.

24:28.834 --> 24:31.769
They're in there studying
their little hearts out.
