Is Balki around?

01:26.319 --> 01:27.220
Well, no, he's not.

01:27.253 --> 01:29.122
Then, hurry up,
Lydia, before he gets here.

01:29.155 --> 01:30.691
Harriette! Harriette!

01:30.724 --> 01:33.660
Oh, hi, baby. Bye, baby.

01:33.694 --> 01:36.830
No. Wait, wait!

01:36.863 --> 01:39.132
This is the day you said
I could drive the elevator.

01:39.165 --> 01:41.134
You big kidder, you.

01:42.836 --> 01:45.572
Don't do that, baby.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.608
Uh, but I've been looking
forward to this all week.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.511
Okay, let's get to it.

01:50.544 --> 01:54.314
Oh, I'm so excited.

01:54.347 --> 01:56.416
I've been practicing
at home in my closet.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.353
Now, now, don't worry.

02:00.386 --> 02:02.689
I remember everything
you‐you teach me.

02:02.723 --> 02:04.925
Balki, make sure you
don't accelerate too fast.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.827
Well, of course, I won't.

02:06.860 --> 02:07.894
Don't be ridiculous.

02:09.763 --> 02:11.732
What does accelerate mean?

02:13.499 --> 02:16.136
[screams]

02:19.973 --> 02:21.742
Gotta remember
to use smaller words.

02:23.744 --> 02:24.945
Appleton.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.813
Uh, yes, sir, Mr. Wainright.

02:26.847 --> 02:27.948
Appleton, that was a great story

02:27.981 --> 02:29.182
you wrote on
the commodities scandal.

02:29.215 --> 02:32.553
Well, thank you, sir. I try to
do my small part for the paper.

02:32.586 --> 02:34.354
Oh, don't be
so modest. It was good.

02:34.387 --> 02:36.256
You should try being
a little more assertive.

02:36.289 --> 02:37.691
Well, how about an office

02:37.724 --> 02:39.560
on the same floor with the other
investigative reporters?

02:39.593 --> 02:41.427
I said assertive, not pushy.

02:41.461 --> 02:43.229
Oh, sorry, sir.

02:43.263 --> 02:44.898
Where did you find
that informant?

02:44.931 --> 02:46.432
‐ What was it you called him?
‐ Sore Throat.

02:48.835 --> 02:50.537
Actually, Balki
came up with the name.

02:50.571 --> 02:52.238
In fact, Balki was
the one who found him.

02:52.272 --> 02:54.340
That's why Balki's name
is on the article, too.

02:54.374 --> 02:56.442
Well, I should say
well done to Bartokomous, too.

02:56.476 --> 02:58.244
Uh, is he around?

02:58.278 --> 03:00.614
Well, Harriette's
letting him drive the elevator.

03:00.647 --> 03:03.517
(Harriette)
'Stop!'

03:05.351 --> 03:06.352
That would be him now.

03:14.728 --> 03:15.562
Wow.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.668
That thing can stop on a dime.

03:24.437 --> 03:27.741
Harriette, I think
I'm going to try it again.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.612
Why don't you
take a breather, baby

03:31.645 --> 03:33.747
while I try finding my contacts?

03:35.415 --> 03:37.684
My God.
I'm shorter!

03:41.522 --> 03:43.690
Balki, Balki,
look who's come to see us.

03:44.791 --> 03:46.993
Mr. Wainright.

03:47.027 --> 03:48.729
It's so nice of you to come down

03:48.762 --> 03:50.463
and‐and join us in our basement.

03:50.496 --> 03:51.898
Well, I‐I just
came by to tell you

03:51.932 --> 03:54.334
what an asset
you've been to Appleton.

03:54.367 --> 03:56.002
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Wainright.

03:56.036 --> 03:58.438
I didn't realize..

03:58.471 --> 04:00.774
I didn't realize
I'd made an asset of myself.

04:03.510 --> 04:04.911
Uh, no, no, no, Balki‐‐

04:04.945 --> 04:07.480
I‐I know, I've made
a few mistakes in my time

04:07.514 --> 04:09.550
but I don't think that's
any reason for name‐calling.

04:09.583 --> 04:13.286
No, no, no.
It's not what you think.

04:13.319 --> 04:14.821
He's still
learning the language.

04:14.855 --> 04:16.422
Obviously.

04:16.456 --> 04:18.825
Well, just keep up
the good work, Appleton.

04:18.858 --> 04:21.562
You have a great
future as a reporter.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.864
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

04:23.897 --> 04:26.299
Now, wasn't that nice
of him to come down here?

04:26.332 --> 04:27.834
Well, to be honest with you

04:27.868 --> 04:29.836
I'm still smarting from
that asset remark.

04:31.705 --> 04:35.576
No, no, no, Balki, an asset
is a good thing. A good thing.

04:35.609 --> 04:36.710
He was paying you a compliment.

04:36.743 --> 04:38.679
‐ Really?
‐ Yes.

04:38.712 --> 04:40.013
Wish I could
have understood this

04:40.046 --> 04:41.682
so I could have
enjoyed the moment.

04:44.518 --> 04:45.719
Excuse me, gentlemen.

04:45.752 --> 04:47.721
Where can I find Larry Appleton

04:47.754 --> 04:49.790
and Balki Bartokomous?

04:49.823 --> 04:51.958
‐ I'm Larry Appleton.
‐ I'm Balki Bartokomous.

04:51.992 --> 04:54.628
Oh, I saw your names were on
that commodities scandal story.

04:54.661 --> 04:55.662
Nice work.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.497
Oh, thank you.

04:57.531 --> 04:58.899
We're already celebrities.

05:01.768 --> 05:02.669
What can we do for you?

05:05.639 --> 05:06.573
This is a subpoena.

05:08.509 --> 05:10.076
What...what that is?

05:10.110 --> 05:11.912
Oh, uh, you're
to appear in court

05:11.945 --> 05:13.780
tomorrow before Judge Gideon

05:13.814 --> 05:15.816
and reveal everything you know
about the commodities scandal.

05:17.518 --> 05:20.086
Well, uh, cousin,
I guess you're right.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.923
We are becoming celebrities.

05:22.956 --> 05:25.559
People want us to start
making personal appearances.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.095
[instrumental music]

05:35.068 --> 05:37.671
Okay, cousin,
what if the judge asks you

05:37.704 --> 05:39.873
"How was the inside
information passed?"

05:39.906 --> 05:42.342
Alright, alright,
your honor, uh..

05:44.010 --> 05:46.379
"Each commodity
was given a code name."

05:46.412 --> 05:48.114
If I can give an example..

05:48.148 --> 05:50.083
"Pork bellies
were called porky pigs."

05:50.116 --> 05:51.117
I can elaborate, if you'd like.

05:51.151 --> 05:53.754
No need, cousin. No need.

05:53.787 --> 05:56.489
Wow. You really..

05:56.523 --> 05:58.892
You really have these facts
at your fingernails.

06:00.460 --> 06:01.528
I have to, Balki.

06:01.562 --> 06:02.963
I'm representing "The Chronicle"

06:02.996 --> 06:05.566
in what could be
the trial of the decade.

06:05.599 --> 06:08.434
I have a responsibility to
have all of my facts straight.

06:08.468 --> 06:10.537
Besides, we could
be on television.

06:13.674 --> 06:15.441
Oh, cousin, then that‐that means

06:15.475 --> 06:16.977
we'll have to dress
for the camera.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.880
That means nothing
too busy. No stripes.

06:19.913 --> 06:22.015
And I would recommend
you don't wear yellow

06:22.048 --> 06:24.184
because it makes
you look very pale.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.553
Kind of like that guy
in "Poltergeist 2".

06:26.587 --> 06:28.522
You're gonna die.

06:31.024 --> 06:33.560
‐ Thanks for the tip.
‐ You're welcome.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.662
Hey, cousin, when do I get
to tell the judge what I know?

06:39.866 --> 06:41.868
What do you know?

06:41.902 --> 06:44.070
Well...I've got that right here

06:44.104 --> 06:45.105
in my filing system.

06:50.877 --> 06:52.946
"Your Honor, I have
everything you want to know

06:52.979 --> 06:54.881
"about Sore Throat, right here.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.150
"Name, Waldo Gillings.

06:57.183 --> 07:01.487
"Occupation, driver for
a big Chicago stockbroker.

07:01.522 --> 07:04.891
"Hobby, listening
to his boss make crooked deals

07:04.925 --> 07:06.527
"in the back seat of the Limo."

07:08.895 --> 07:11.464
Balki..

07:11.497 --> 07:14.701
...you can't tell the judge
anything about Sore Throat.

07:14.735 --> 07:16.703
We promised Waldo
that we would not reveal

07:16.737 --> 07:19.239
that he was the source
of our information.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.974
As reporters, we
have to protect people

07:21.007 --> 07:24.144
who come to us with information
they feel should be made public.

07:24.177 --> 07:27.213
They know a reporter will
not divulge their identity.

07:27.247 --> 07:29.816
And that is what
I promised Waldo.

07:29.850 --> 07:32.152
But‐but, cousin, I have heard
that if you don't tell a judge

07:32.185 --> 07:35.589
what he wants to know,
he can send you to jail.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.691
Now, Balki, yes, it's true.

07:37.724 --> 07:40.060
The judge could
have us incarcerated.

07:40.093 --> 07:42.162
Oh, cousin, I don't
want to be set on fire!

07:44.798 --> 07:45.866
No, no.

07:49.235 --> 07:54.074
Not incinerated, incarcerated.

07:54.107 --> 07:55.742
Incarcerated.

07:57.010 --> 07:59.813
It means sent to jail.

07:59.846 --> 08:03.249
But, Balki,
it's a small price to pay.

08:03.283 --> 08:05.118
We have to stand up
for the first amendment.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.888
Sit down.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.222
We have to stand up
for freedom of the press.

08:09.255 --> 08:11.558
Sit down.

08:11.592 --> 08:13.259
We have to stand up..
Sit down!

08:13.293 --> 08:17.531
For the very constitution upon
which this country was founded.

08:17.564 --> 08:20.033
Well, cousin, why you
didn't say so sooner?

08:20.066 --> 08:21.101
I didn't know
we were fighting

08:21.134 --> 08:23.937
for life, puberty,
and the pursuit of happiness.

08:25.939 --> 08:27.674
Well, we are, Balki. We are.

08:27.708 --> 08:30.644
Well, that settles it.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.679
If that judge wants
to know anything

08:32.712 --> 08:35.881
about Sore Throat, we aren't
going to tell him a thing

08:35.916 --> 08:38.251
even if he sends
us to jail forever!

08:38.284 --> 08:39.820
And if he don't like that

08:39.852 --> 08:42.889
he can take it
to the bank and smoke it!

08:45.826 --> 08:47.728
That's the spirit.

08:47.761 --> 08:48.895
And you know
what I think, Balki?

08:48.929 --> 08:51.031
Not really.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.734
Tomorrow when
the judge sees the strength

08:53.767 --> 08:57.638
of our commitment, he's not
going to throw us in jail.

08:57.671 --> 08:59.305
He's going to throw us a parade.

08:59.339 --> 09:00.574
Ha ha!

09:06.179 --> 09:07.848
Does this mean we
missed the parade?

09:16.857 --> 09:17.858
[instrumental music]

09:28.118 --> 09:28.894
It's five big ones, Balki.

09:31.163 --> 09:34.132
We've been in stir
for five hours.

09:36.735 --> 09:38.336
Well, cousin, you
did tell Judge Gideon

09:38.370 --> 09:41.306
that we'd stay in here
until hell warms over.

09:42.775 --> 09:43.809
And I meant it.

09:44.877 --> 09:47.445
‐ Could you believe that judge?
‐ Hmm.

09:47.479 --> 09:48.847
He thought he could break me

09:48.881 --> 09:51.183
by throwing me
in this hole. Ha!

09:51.216 --> 09:53.251
Ha! Yeah..

09:53.285 --> 09:55.153
This cell isn't so bad.

09:55.187 --> 09:57.923
It's not as bad as
the one I was in on Mypos.

09:57.956 --> 10:01.326
It's got nice bunk beds
and ru‐running water.

10:01.359 --> 10:04.763
Judge Gideon didn't know
who he was dealing with.

10:04.797 --> 10:05.964
We're..
You were in jail?

10:08.266 --> 10:09.234
What for?

10:13.305 --> 10:14.339
Kidnapping.

10:17.275 --> 10:18.944
You were arrested
for kidnapping?

10:21.914 --> 10:25.818
Yeah, I was
accused of a 506..

10:27.520 --> 10:28.987
Stealing a baby goat.

10:32.958 --> 10:34.292
Oh. Kid‐napping.

10:38.030 --> 10:39.865
But it was all a mistake.
A mistake, I tell you.

10:41.266 --> 10:44.837
The‐the baby goat
had a rotten home life and..

10:44.870 --> 10:46.171
...used to like to
hang around with me.

10:48.073 --> 10:50.275
I gave him a lot of
positive ego re‐inforcement.

10:52.945 --> 10:56.048
So, you've been
behind bars before.

10:56.081 --> 10:58.183
Yeah, we‐well, on‐on Mypos.

10:58.216 --> 10:59.785
Their cell don't have bars.

11:04.256 --> 11:05.824
‐ No bars?
‐ No, no.

11:05.858 --> 11:07.359
On Mypos, when they
put you in jail

11:07.392 --> 11:09.562
they make you stand
in front of the court house

11:09.595 --> 11:11.296
and they draw
a circle around you.

11:20.372 --> 11:21.540
What keeps you from escaping?

11:21.574 --> 11:22.440
It's against the law.

11:29.548 --> 11:31.917
Here's your blankets.

11:31.950 --> 11:34.286
Thanks, but I doubt
we'll need them.

11:34.319 --> 11:35.487
We'll be gettin'
out of here soon.

11:35.521 --> 11:37.355
Well, I wouldn't
get my hopes up.

11:37.389 --> 11:39.224
The last reporter
Judge Gideon put here in jail

11:39.257 --> 11:41.860
for not revealing
his sources is still here.

11:41.894 --> 11:44.262
‐ He is?
‐ How long ago was that?

11:44.296 --> 11:46.431
Oh, let's see,
he was here when I got here.

11:46.464 --> 11:49.467
And I've been here,
let's see, uh...three years.

11:50.435 --> 11:51.403
Goodnight.

11:55.508 --> 11:57.142
Three years?

12:00.579 --> 12:02.380
Balki, I don't think
I can do three years.

12:04.016 --> 12:06.151
Yes, you can, cousin.

12:06.184 --> 12:07.285

12:07.319 --> 12:08.887
in that compact little body.

We could be here for years.

What did I say?
Was it something good?

12:51.263 --> 12:53.031
Well, of course it was good.

12:53.065 --> 12:54.900
Yeah, you‐you said that...

12:54.933 --> 12:57.970
...that we were in here
because we are protecting Waldo

12:58.003 --> 13:00.172
and the constitution
and freedom of the press.

13:01.674 --> 13:04.577

a lot of things.

takes to become a reporter.

to stand up for anything.

13:24.630 --> 13:25.931
Well, then sit down.

13:27.165 --> 13:27.933
I can do that.

13:29.735 --> 13:33.038
Now, look, cousin,
people like you

13:33.071 --> 13:35.373

the constitution.

regular people like you

upon to do something heroic

be in separate cells?

I'll get on it right away.

Oh, no, no, no, no,

That was my plan.

to have a word with Dutch.

through a bad time in his life

to reach out to.
