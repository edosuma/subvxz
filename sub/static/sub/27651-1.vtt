[Alec] Okay, I've made

00:14.845 --> 00:16.685

No worries, thank you.

00:16.725 --> 00:19.645
[Fred]<i> Many of us dream</i>

00:16.725 --> 00:19.645

00:19.685 --> 00:22.045
Duck wrap? Yep.

00:19.685 --> 00:22.045
Hot one? Yep.

00:22.085 --> 00:25.605
[Fred]<i> But some people</i>

00:22.085 --> 00:25.605
<i>are determined</i>

00:22.085 --> 00:25.605
<i>to make it a reality.</i>

00:25.645 --> 00:26.645
Thank you.

00:26.685 --> 00:28.805
There's nothing

00:26.685 --> 00:28.805
like this out there.

00:28.845 --> 00:31.325
We left our jobs

00:28.845 --> 00:31.325
to follow our dream.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.565
I want to be

00:31.365 --> 00:33.565
the Nando's of duck.

00:36.565 --> 00:40.045

00:36.565 --> 00:40.045

00:43.845 --> 00:45.565
Over the next six weeks,

00:45.605 --> 00:48.885
I'll be looking

00:45.605 --> 00:48.885
for the new generation

00:45.605 --> 00:48.885

00:51.085 --> 00:54.605
Here in Manchester,

00:51.085 --> 00:54.605
the food capital of the north,

00:54.645 --> 00:57.445
some of the UK's most

01:08.925 --> 01:11.565

-Service.

01:15.765 --> 01:17.525
It is tough out there,

01:17.565 --> 01:20.485
but businesses that offer

01:17.565 --> 01:20.485
the customer something

01:17.565 --> 01:20.485
different are thriving.

how long?

01:22.445 --> 01:25.205
If the business plan is right,

01:22.445 --> 01:25.205
I'll fight to invest.

-Probably.

01:38.925 --> 01:40.805
That's a £400,000 pork chop.

01:40.845 --> 01:44.685
When the kitchen closes,

01:40.845 --> 01:44.685
will the investors

01:40.845 --> 01:44.685
make them an offer?

01:44.725 --> 01:46.245
Everything's riding on it now.

01:46.285 --> 01:49.045
The doors are open

01:46.285 --> 01:49.045

The sector is so successful,

02:30.485 --> 02:35.765
in fact, that it has almost

02:30.485 --> 02:35.765
doubled in three years.

02:35.805 --> 02:39.165
<i>The investors try out</i>

02:35.805 --> 02:39.165

02:41.685 --> 02:44.205
[Charlie] Quickly check

02:41.685 --> 02:44.205
the margin calculation.

02:44.245 --> 02:46.645
The margin's wrong

02:44.245 --> 02:46.645

03:09.325 --> 03:12.125
for the investors

03:09.325 --> 03:12.125
is the masala dosa,

03:19.685 --> 03:21.725
Yeah, they're lovely,

03:29.645 --> 03:31.605
It's wicked,

03:29.645 --> 03:31.605

-Good afternoon.

03:46.765 --> 03:49.405
-Hi.

03:49.445 --> 03:51.045
Well, it looks like

03:49.445 --> 03:51.045
it's a good atmosphere

03:49.445 --> 03:51.045
in the kitchen.

03:51.085 --> 03:52.725
-Yes.

03:51.085 --> 03:52.725
-Yeah.

03:52.765 --> 03:55.445
It's a big day today.

03:52.765 --> 03:55.445
It's an amazing opportunity

03:52.765 --> 03:55.445
that you have.

03:55.485 --> 03:59.365
In there, you've got some

03:55.485 --> 03:59.365
of the most respected investors

03:55.485 --> 03:59.365
in the restaurant business.

03:59.405 --> 04:01.605
All you have to do

03:59.405 --> 04:01.605
is cook one dish.

04:01.645 --> 04:03.885
One dish that will

04:01.645 --> 04:03.885
blow their mind away.

04:03.925 --> 04:07.605
The investors can only

04:03.925 --> 04:07.605
choose one of you

04:03.925 --> 04:07.605
to go to Manchester.

04:07.645 --> 04:09.485
-So good luck.

04:07.645 --> 04:09.485
-Thank you.

04:09.525 --> 04:11.325
Thanks very much.

04:11.365 --> 04:14.565
[Fred]<i> They have</i>

04:11.365 --> 04:14.565
<i>millions of pounds</i>

04:11.365 --> 04:14.565
<i>to fund new ideas,</i>

04:14.605 --> 04:18.565
<i>but these investors</i>

04:14.605 --> 04:18.565
<i>back just a handful</i>

04:14.605 --> 04:18.565
<i>of start-ups each year.</i>

04:18.605 --> 04:20.605
Right. Let's get ready

04:18.605 --> 04:20.605
for business.

04:21.565 --> 04:23.885
-How are you?

04:21.565 --> 04:23.885
-Good.

04:23.925 --> 04:27.365
Right.

04:23.925 --> 04:27.365
This is an important sector,

04:23.925 --> 04:27.365
but what is fast casual?

04:27.405 --> 04:29.645
If I was to define

04:27.405 --> 04:29.645
fast causal,

04:29.685 --> 04:33.285
it's still often cooked

04:29.685 --> 04:33.285
to order, but it's delivered

04:29.685 --> 04:33.285
consistently and fast.

04:33.325 --> 04:34.885
Chipotle, Nando's and so on.

04:34.925 --> 04:37.845
And I think it's

04:34.925 --> 04:37.845
an emerging sector,

04:34.925 --> 04:37.845
particularly in the UK.

04:38.605 --> 04:40.285
I'm Jane O'Riordan.

04:40.325 --> 04:42.325
I build restaurant brands.

04:42.365 --> 04:46.965
<i>Most of these brands</i>

04:42.365 --> 04:46.965
<i>you would have heard of.</i>

04:42.365 --> 04:46.965
<i>Nando's, Pizza Express, GBK.</i>

04:47.005 --> 04:48.885
What's the first thing

04:47.005 --> 04:48.885
you're gonna be looking at?

04:48.925 --> 04:50.965
That dish that we get served

04:51.005 --> 04:54.285
has got to be something

04:51.005 --> 04:54.285
that you crave,

04:51.005 --> 04:54.285
even when you're not hungry.

04:54.325 --> 04:57.245
My name is Charlie McVeigh,

04:54.325 --> 04:57.245
I've been in the restaurant

04:54.325 --> 04:57.245
business for 20 years.

04:57.285 --> 05:01.165
<i>First and foremost,</i>

04:57.285 --> 05:01.165
<i>I'm going to look for</i>

04:57.285 --> 05:01.165
<i>a brand that stands out,</i>

05:01.205 --> 05:05.445
which is the basis for

05:01.205 --> 05:05.445
a rollout, i.e. an expansion

05:01.205 --> 05:05.445
across high streets.

05:05.485 --> 05:08.485
If there is

05:05.485 --> 05:08.485
something out there,

05:05.485 --> 05:08.485
we'd like to find it.

05:08.525 --> 05:10.445
-[Paul] What are you

05:08.525 --> 05:10.445
going to go for?

05:08.525 --> 05:10.445
-[man] For a dosa.

05:10.485 --> 05:12.045
[Paul]

05:10.485 --> 05:12.045
Yeah, no problem.

05:12.085 --> 05:14.165
[Fred]

05:12.085 --> 05:14.165
<i>First to pitch are Jah Jyot,</i>

05:14.205 --> 05:18.285
<i>lead by 46-year-old Ranie,</i>

05:14.205 --> 05:18.285
<i>who used to sell cars.</i>

05:18.325 --> 05:20.565
[Ranie]

05:18.325 --> 05:20.565
<i>It was a light bulb moment</i>

05:18.325 --> 05:20.565
<i>three and a half years ago</i>

05:20.605 --> 05:22.525
and it was my son,

05:20.605 --> 05:22.525
who was only ten years old

05:20.605 --> 05:22.525
at the time,

05:22.565 --> 05:24.645
he turned around

05:22.565 --> 05:24.645
"Dad, you really need

05:22.565 --> 05:24.645
to do something

05:24.685 --> 05:26.925
that truly makes

05:24.685 --> 05:26.925
you happy again."

05:26.965 --> 05:29.365
And that was it.

05:26.965 --> 05:29.365
It was that eureka moment.

05:30.085 --> 05:31.605
Chicken?

05:31.645 --> 05:34.405
It started off with

05:31.645 --> 05:34.405
a drunken conversation

05:31.645 --> 05:34.405
in our local pub.

05:34.445 --> 05:36.805
<i>Obviously, he knew</i>

05:34.445 --> 05:36.805
<i>that I was a chef.</i>

05:36.845 --> 05:40.765
So, we sat down

05:36.845 --> 05:40.765
over a few beers,

05:36.845 --> 05:40.765
and it's like, "Do it then."

05:40.805 --> 05:43.725
[Fred]<i> The three friends</i>

05:40.805 --> 05:43.725
<i>have big dreams for Jah Jyot.</i>

05:43.765 --> 05:47.285
<i>Instead of a stall,</i>

05:43.765 --> 05:47.285
<i>they want five</i>

05:43.765 --> 05:47.285
<i>permanent sites</i>

05:47.325 --> 05:50.525
<i>delivering a full-on</i>

05:52.125 --> 05:54.605
a mini Punjab, you know.

05:54.645 --> 05:56.965
You'll have everything.

05:54.645 --> 05:56.965
You'll have your tuk tuks,

05:54.645 --> 05:56.965
you'll have your smells,

05:57.005 --> 05:58.765
<i>you'll have authenticity.</i>

05:58.805 --> 06:01.445
<i>And not just being</i>

<i>your standard curry house.</i>

06:03.485 --> 06:06.365
[Fred]<i> Each team will serve</i>

06:03.485 --> 06:06.365
<i>just one signature dish</i>

06:06.405 --> 06:10.365
<i>to prove that their food</i>

06:06.405 --> 06:10.365
<i>is as good as their idea.</i>

06:10.405 --> 06:13.845
[Ranie] The key to it

06:10.405 --> 06:13.845
is making sure that

06:10.405 --> 06:13.845
the temperature of this griddle

06:13.885 --> 06:17.165
is extremely high

06:13.885 --> 06:17.165
to start with.

06:17.205 --> 06:21.885
[Fred]<i> Jah Jyot believe</i>

06:17.205 --> 06:21.885
<i>their filled dosas could be</i>

06:17.205 --> 06:21.885
<i>a hit on the high street.</i>

06:21.925 --> 06:24.805
As soon as the dosa mix

06:21.925 --> 06:24.805
hits the griddle,

06:24.845 --> 06:27.245
it starts crisping up already.

06:27.285 --> 06:29.165
Clearly, they've got

06:27.285 --> 06:29.165
some experience there.

06:29.205 --> 06:33.485
But I would say is

06:29.205 --> 06:33.485
that it's ambitious

06:29.205 --> 06:33.485
to open up five sites

06:33.525 --> 06:35.405
all at once.

06:33.525 --> 06:35.405
I would start with one,

06:35.445 --> 06:39.605
prove the model,

06:35.445 --> 06:39.605
and then look at

06:35.445 --> 06:39.605
funding for growth.

06:39.645 --> 06:43.725
I'm Maurice Abboudi,

06:39.645 --> 06:43.725
I've been in the industry

06:39.645 --> 06:43.725
for over 20 years.

06:43.765 --> 06:48.165
I've been involved and worked

06:43.765 --> 06:48.165
for Domino's Pizza as head

06:43.765 --> 06:48.165
of business development.

06:48.205 --> 06:49.565
It looks good.

06:49.605 --> 06:52.445
There's three guys

06:49.605 --> 06:52.445
involved, though.

06:52.485 --> 06:54.445
Is that too many chefs,

06:52.485 --> 06:54.445
so to speak?

06:54.485 --> 06:59.125
My name is Scott Collins,

06:54.485 --> 06:59.125

-Yeah.

Let me get Jah Jyot now.

07:23.885 --> 07:25.325
-[Jane] Hello.

07:23.885 --> 07:25.325
-Hi.

07:25.365 --> 07:26.885
[Jane] Wow, look at this.

07:26.925 --> 07:28.485
-[Maurice]

07:26.925 --> 07:28.485
It looks fabulous.

07:26.925 --> 07:28.485
-[Ranie] Thank you very much.

07:28.525 --> 07:30.445
[Jane] The candles,

07:28.525 --> 07:30.445
look at that.

07:33.245 --> 07:36.405
So the dish that

07:33.245 --> 07:36.405
you're having here today

07:33.245 --> 07:36.405
is masala dosa.

07:36.445 --> 07:40.725
So, a gluten-free rice

07:36.445 --> 07:40.725
flour pancake with masala

07:36.445 --> 07:40.725
sauce over the top.

07:40.765 --> 07:44.125
Inside is a slow-cooked

07:40.765 --> 07:44.125
chicken tikka pieces,

07:44.165 --> 07:49.405
presented with a Jyot

07:44.165 --> 07:49.405
which signifies, really,

07:44.165 --> 07:49.405
our journey as Jah Jyot.

07:49.445 --> 07:52.085
Jack, Alannah and Holly,

07:49.445 --> 07:52.085
who are my three children.

07:52.125 --> 07:53.565
So, my children are my light.

07:55.085 --> 07:56.885
We have put chillies

07:55.085 --> 07:56.885
down the side.

07:56.925 --> 07:58.405
I will warn you,

07:56.925 --> 07:58.405
they are very hot.

08:00.205 --> 08:01.685
[Jane] Okay,

08:00.205 --> 08:01.685
he's trying the chili.

08:03.245 --> 08:05.405
[Jane chuckles]

08:05.445 --> 08:07.165
-[Charlie] Did you have one?

08:05.445 --> 08:07.165
-[both laughing]

08:07.205 --> 08:09.805
[Maurice]

08:07.205 --> 08:09.805
I have as well.

08:09.845 --> 08:13.285
I think its utter genius

08:09.845 --> 08:13.285
to have spotted something

08:09.845 --> 08:13.285
where it's gluten-free,

08:13.325 --> 08:14.925
but it's designed

08:13.325 --> 08:14.925
to be gluten-free,

08:14.965 --> 08:18.685
it's made with rice.

08:14.965 --> 08:18.685
It's a fast-growing

08:14.965 --> 08:18.685
segment of the market.

08:18.725 --> 08:20.605
And I think

08:18.725 --> 08:20.605
it tastes delicious.

08:20.645 --> 08:22.765
What sort of locations

08:20.645 --> 08:22.765
are you looking for?

08:22.805 --> 08:26.325
The idea or the vision.

08:22.805 --> 08:26.325
You've got an open space

08:26.365 --> 08:29.885
and in there would be

08:26.365 --> 08:29.885
the visuals of India.

08:29.925 --> 08:33.805
Of tuk tuks and taxis

08:29.925 --> 08:33.805
and people walking

08:29.925 --> 08:33.805
and hustle and bustle.

08:33.845 --> 08:36.805
So, if I understand,

08:33.845 --> 08:36.805
it's a sort of miniature

08:33.845 --> 08:36.805
street market?

08:36.845 --> 08:39.645
-Basically.

08:36.845 --> 08:39.645
-[Charlie] With different

08:36.845 --> 08:39.645
stands selling different items.

08:39.685 --> 08:42.125
-A bit more theater.

08:39.685 --> 08:42.125
I mean, I can see that.

08:39.685 --> 08:42.125
-Yeah.

08:42.165 --> 08:44.205
And the idea...

08:42.165 --> 08:44.205
You're asking for

08:42.165 --> 08:44.205
quite a lot of money.

08:44.245 --> 08:46.925
The idea is that you want

08:44.245 --> 08:46.925
to do five of these

08:44.245 --> 08:46.925
all at the same time?

08:46.965 --> 08:51.405
It's a staged five over

08:46.965 --> 08:51.405
a very small period of time

08:51.445 --> 08:54.645
and bringing culture

08:51.445 --> 08:54.645
as well as food together.

08:54.685 --> 08:58.125
I think there's

08:54.685 --> 08:58.125
an exciting opportunity here

08:54.685 --> 08:58.125
trying to get out,

08:58.165 --> 09:03.245
but I find the street market

08:58.165 --> 09:03.245
idea to be overly complicated

08:58.165 --> 09:03.245
and probably undeliverable.

09:03.285 --> 09:07.565
However, I do think

09:03.285 --> 09:07.565
that the idea of doing

09:03.285 --> 09:07.565
dosas to this quality

09:07.605 --> 09:10.645
with this gluten-free

09:07.605 --> 09:10.645
wrapper is phenomenal.

09:10.685 --> 09:12.165
Okay. Thank you.

09:12.205 --> 09:13.645
-Glad it's over.

09:13.685 --> 09:15.765

a lot of different cultures.

11:00.525 --> 11:02.485
-Thank you.

11:02.525 --> 11:04.005
[indistinct chatter]

11:06.125 --> 11:07.845
[Fred] Can you tell us

11:06.125 --> 11:07.845
what we're about to eat?

11:07.885 --> 11:11.165
Absolutely. The pork

11:07.885 --> 11:11.165
is based on a dish

11:07.885 --> 11:11.165
called lechon kawali,

11:11.205 --> 11:12.805
a traditional Filipino recipe.

11:12.845 --> 11:14.845
And then it comes with

11:12.845 --> 11:14.845
a pickled papaya salad,

11:14.885 --> 11:16.925
steamed jasmine rice,

11:16.965 --> 11:18.805
and then you have three

11:16.965 --> 11:18.805
different dipping sauces.

11:28.165 --> 11:29.525
[Jane] Wow.

11:29.565 --> 11:30.965
[Charlie] Oh, my God.

11:31.005 --> 11:33.765
-That's very good.

11:31.005 --> 11:33.765
-That is bloody delicious.

11:35.125 --> 11:36.725
-This is absolutely delicious.

11:35.125 --> 11:36.725
-[Lee] Thank you.

11:36.765 --> 11:38.245
I really, really love it.

11:38.285 --> 11:41.325
But most importantly,

11:38.285 --> 11:41.325
what do the investors

11:38.285 --> 11:41.325
think? Jane?

11:41.365 --> 11:43.565
I think the combination

11:41.365 --> 11:43.565
of flavor is amazing.

11:43.605 --> 11:47.045
It's very interesting,

11:43.605 --> 11:47.045
I have never eaten

11:43.605 --> 11:47.045
Filipino-inspired food before.

11:47.085 --> 11:48.285
-[Fred] Maurice?

11:47.085 --> 11:48.285
-It's superb.

11:48.325 --> 11:50.605
It's the sort of food

11:48.325 --> 11:50.605
I could eat twice a week.

11:50.645 --> 11:54.405
It's hearty,

11:50.645 --> 11:54.405
it's delicious, it's fresh.

11:54.445 --> 11:57.565
You know, charge me

11:54.445 --> 11:57.565
nine, £10 for this,

11:54.445 --> 11:57.565
I'm not gonna feel ripped off.

11:57.605 --> 11:58.845
-Thank you.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.565
It might actually be

11:58.885 --> 12:00.565
the best pork I've ever had.

12:02.525 --> 12:04.165
[Scott] I can't fault it

12:02.525 --> 12:04.165
flavor-wise,

12:04.205 --> 12:06.005
but where does

12:04.205 --> 12:06.005
the barbecue bit

12:04.205 --> 12:06.005
come into the name?

12:07.485 --> 12:10.445
When we started,

12:07.485 --> 12:10.445
we barbecued everything,

12:10.485 --> 12:13.965
and we found that

12:10.485 --> 12:13.965
as we got more

12:10.485 --> 12:13.965
and more popular,

12:14.005 --> 12:16.045
we had to adapt the way

12:14.005 --> 12:16.045
that we were cooking.

12:16.085 --> 12:19.205
What we would like to do now

12:16.085 --> 12:19.205
is to bring the barbecue

12:16.085 --> 12:19.205
back into it

12:19.245 --> 12:21.125
because it's a massive part

12:19.245 --> 12:21.125
of Filipino culture.

12:21.165 --> 12:25.045
You mention in your dec

12:21.165 --> 12:25.045
about nose-to-tail eating.

12:25.085 --> 12:28.205
Do you think there will be

12:25.085 --> 12:28.205
a challenge with some of

12:25.085 --> 12:28.205
the items on the menu?

12:28.245 --> 12:31.125
How do we think ox heart

12:28.245 --> 12:31.125
and duck heart...

12:31.165 --> 12:35.285
It really is only for

12:31.165 --> 12:35.285
the people who are

12:31.165 --> 12:35.285
willing to take a risk.

12:35.325 --> 12:37.445
When they do,

12:35.325 --> 12:37.445
they absolutely love it.

12:37.485 --> 12:39.765
-It's kind of what we're about.

12:37.485 --> 12:39.765
-Good, stick to your guns.

12:39.805 --> 12:41.005
Yeah.

12:41.045 --> 12:43.885
Right, guys,

12:41.045 --> 12:43.885
if they go to Manchester,

12:43.925 --> 12:45.285
what do you want to see?

12:45.325 --> 12:46.965
I'm particularly interested

12:45.325 --> 12:46.965
to see how it goes

12:47.005 --> 12:49.205
from a British, sort of,

12:47.005 --> 12:49.205
public point of view.

12:49.245 --> 12:51.765
Are they going

12:49.245 --> 12:51.765
to come regularly

12:49.245 --> 12:51.765
and have ox heart?

12:51.805 --> 12:54.645
If you get to Manchester,

12:51.805 --> 12:54.645
I want an immersive experience.

12:54.685 --> 12:56.725
But even if it's something

12:54.685 --> 12:56.725
that feels authentic

12:56.765 --> 12:59.285
and I come away knowing

12:56.765 --> 12:59.285
a little bit more

12:56.765 --> 12:59.285
about the Philippines,

12:59.325 --> 13:01.525
and culture

12:59.325 --> 13:01.525
and food and drink,

13:01.565 --> 13:03.805
that's what people go away

13:01.565 --> 13:03.805
talking about nowadays.

13:03.845 --> 13:05.045
A hundred percent,

13:03.845 --> 13:05.045
I agree.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.525
I think we did our best.

13:06.565 --> 13:09.045
We delivered on the food

13:09.085 --> 13:12.445
and we had a really nice

13:09.085 --> 13:12.445
chat with them, so I mean...

13:12.485 --> 13:14.885
-I think we're worth

13:12.485 --> 13:14.885
every penny, right?

13:12.485 --> 13:14.885
-Yeah. [laughs]

13:14.925 --> 13:17.845
Yeah, we're worth every penny.

13:52.205 --> 13:54.845
These are my duck legs

13:52.205 --> 13:54.845
which have been slow cooked

13:54.885 --> 13:56.845
in a water bath,

13:54.885 --> 13:56.845
so like sous vide

13:56.885 --> 14:00.125
for between four to six hours,

13:56.885 --> 14:00.125
so they become

13:56.885 --> 14:00.125
beautifully tender.

14:00.165 --> 14:02.925
So, I'm putting these

14:00.165 --> 14:02.925
under the grill now

14:00.165 --> 14:02.925
to finish off the skin.

14:02.965 --> 14:04.605
We need nice, thin crispy skin.

14:05.125 --> 14:06.445
Bit of texture.

14:06.485 --> 14:08.765
This is my little mascot,

14:06.485 --> 14:08.765
little Quackers.

14:08.805 --> 14:11.005
Named after my first

14:08.805 --> 14:11.005
ever pet which was a duck.

14:11.045 --> 14:13.925
Do you think

14:11.045 --> 14:13.925
it's a potential

14:11.045 --> 14:13.925
good investment?

14:13.965 --> 14:16.005
As a brand,

14:13.965 --> 14:16.005
it's instantly understandable.

14:16.045 --> 14:18.685
I know where he comes from,

14:16.045 --> 14:18.685
I know what they do.

14:18.725 --> 14:21.565
What sort of gets me though

14:18.725 --> 14:21.565
is it's been around a while.

14:21.605 --> 14:23.485
Duck is not new.

14:23.525 --> 14:25.765
Why haven't we seen it before?

14:25.805 --> 14:31.365
[Fred]<i> Ed needs an investor</i>

14:25.805 --> 14:31.365

14:31.405 --> 14:35.565
It's taken me six years

14:31.405 --> 14:35.565
to turn it into a relatively

14:31.405 --> 14:35.565
good, profitable business,

14:35.605 --> 14:40.085
but I need it to be

14:35.605 --> 14:40.085
a business that can

14:35.605 --> 14:40.085
sustain my family,

14:40.125 --> 14:43.205
<i>so if I don't get it</i>

<i>to that level</i>

14:40.125 --> 14:43.205

14:43.245 --> 14:45.005
then I may well have to think

14:43.245 --> 14:45.005
about doing something else.

14:47.725 --> 14:49.005
Do you fancy some duck?

14:49.045 --> 14:50.205
-Yeah.

14:49.045 --> 14:50.205
-Yes.

14:54.885 --> 14:56.645
Hey, everyone.

14:56.685 --> 14:57.885
-Hello.

14:56.685 --> 14:57.885
-How are you doing?

15:00.765 --> 15:02.525
Can you tell us what

15:00.765 --> 15:02.525
we are about to eat, please?

15:02.565 --> 15:06.165
Absolutely.

15:02.565 --> 15:06.165
So, I've cooked for you today,

15:02.565 --> 15:06.165
traditional confit duck leg

15:06.205 --> 15:10.325
on a bed of chips cooked

15:06.205 --> 15:10.325
in our very own duck fat,

15:06.205 --> 15:10.325
and a side of Asian slaw.

15:10.365 --> 15:13.125
You've got a hoisin sauce,

15:10.365 --> 15:13.125
and you've got a chili

15:10.365 --> 15:13.125
mayo for the chips.

15:16.525 --> 15:18.005
[Maurice]

15:16.525 --> 15:18.005
The chips are fantastic.

15:19.565 --> 15:21.205
[Fred] That looks

15:19.565 --> 15:21.205
delicious actually.

15:21.245 --> 15:24.205
I was brought up on duck.

15:21.245 --> 15:24.205
I love duck.

15:24.245 --> 15:25.885
[Maurice] Ed,

15:24.245 --> 15:25.885
what do you sell this for?

15:25.925 --> 15:28.005
That's £10

15:25.925 --> 15:28.005
we sell that for, that box.

15:28.045 --> 15:30.525
The actual confit duck itself

15:28.045 --> 15:30.525
is delicious. It's great.

15:30.565 --> 15:32.445
I can't believe

15:30.565 --> 15:32.445
it's £10, actually.

15:32.485 --> 15:35.045
How can you do

15:32.485 --> 15:35.045
that duck at that price

15:32.485 --> 15:35.045
and make a profit?

15:35.085 --> 15:37.725
I used to work in

15:35.085 --> 15:37.725
the duck industry, so I have

15:35.085 --> 15:37.725
a lot of good contacts.

15:37.765 --> 15:40.885
Confit duck leg, I think,

15:37.765 --> 15:40.885
is put on the menu

15:37.765 --> 15:40.885
at a high price

15:40.925 --> 15:42.645
with a view to making

15:40.925 --> 15:42.645
a ton of money off it,

15:42.685 --> 15:44.445
but it's actually not

15:42.685 --> 15:44.445
very expensive, generally.

15:44.485 --> 15:46.125
What about you, Scott?

15:44.485 --> 15:46.125
I mean, you know your food.

15:46.165 --> 15:49.365
It's hard to describe it

15:46.165 --> 15:49.365
without using a pun

15:46.165 --> 15:49.365
really, isn't it?

15:49.405 --> 15:51.165
-Please do.

15:49.405 --> 15:51.165
-It's ducking great!

15:51.645 --> 15:53.085
[all laughing]

15:54.965 --> 15:56.205
This is the obvious question,

15:56.245 --> 15:58.085
but you're going out

15:56.245 --> 15:58.085
for dinner with three people

15:58.125 --> 16:00.365
and one of them

15:58.125 --> 16:00.365
doesn't like duck.

16:00.405 --> 16:05.445
-That sort of kiboshes

16:00.405 --> 16:05.445
the opportunity for you.

16:00.405 --> 16:05.445
-I know.

16:05.485 --> 16:08.005
I've thought about adding

16:05.485 --> 16:08.005
other things to my menu,

16:08.045 --> 16:10.965
but you know what I think?

16:08.045 --> 16:10.965
If you don't like duck

16:08.045 --> 16:10.965
you're out of luck.

16:12.405 --> 16:14.405
That might rule

16:12.405 --> 16:14.405
a few customers out,

16:14.445 --> 16:18.045
but there's plenty

16:14.445 --> 16:18.045
of one-option restaurants

16:14.445 --> 16:18.045
out there.

16:18.085 --> 16:19.845
-Thank you very much, Ed.

16:18.085 --> 16:19.845
-Thank you.

16:24.365 --> 16:27.125
[Ed]<i> You know, there were</i>

16:24.365 --> 16:27.125
<i>some tough questions.</i>

16:24.365 --> 16:27.125
<i>But they loved the product.</i>

16:27.165 --> 16:29.965
It's a proven concept.

16:27.165 --> 16:29.965
So, I think I'm there.

16:34.605 --> 16:36.725
Right, investors,

16:34.605 --> 16:36.725
we've seen three strong ideas.

16:36.765 --> 16:39.845
Which one excites you the most?

16:36.765 --> 16:39.845
Who is going to go

16:36.765 --> 16:39.845
to Manchester?

16:39.885 --> 16:43.525
<i>The investors will</i>

16:39.885 --> 16:43.525
<i>choose the best idea</i>

16:39.885 --> 16:43.525
<i>by majority vote,</i>

16:43.565 --> 16:46.165
<i>and can pull out</i>

16:43.565 --> 16:46.165
<i>if they're not interested.</i>

16:46.205 --> 16:48.845
Maurice, shall we start

16:46.205 --> 16:48.845
with you maybe?

16:46.205 --> 16:48.845
The Duck Truck.

16:48.885 --> 16:50.685
I thought

16:48.885 --> 16:50.685
he was very investible.

16:50.725 --> 16:53.765
The product was fantastic,

16:50.725 --> 16:53.765
I know he's got

16:50.725 --> 16:53.765
a great supply chain.

16:53.805 --> 16:57.045
What we had then was delicious.

16:53.805 --> 16:57.045
It couldn't have been better,

16:57.085 --> 17:01.565
but how often

16:57.085 --> 17:01.565
would you eat it

16:57.085 --> 17:01.565
and how adaptable is it?

17:01.605 --> 17:04.645
I actually felt more relaxed

17:01.605 --> 17:04.645
in there with them.

17:04.685 --> 17:06.045
Just because you're

17:04.685 --> 17:06.045
talking about your business.

17:06.085 --> 17:08.805
That's what you do every day,

17:06.085 --> 17:08.805
you know it, don't you?

17:08.845 --> 17:11.285
Shall we go for

17:08.845 --> 17:11.285
the second business,

17:08.845 --> 17:11.285
BBQ Dreamz?

17:11.325 --> 17:13.365
It's a confusing name,

17:13.405 --> 17:15.445
but the food speaks

17:13.405 --> 17:15.445
for itself, I think.

17:15.485 --> 17:17.925
It's pretty much first

17:15.485 --> 17:17.925
into the marketplace.

17:17.965 --> 17:21.125
The biggest problem

17:17.965 --> 17:21.125
is the branding

17:17.965 --> 17:21.125
of Filipino food,

17:21.165 --> 17:23.045
because no one

17:21.165 --> 17:23.045
is aware of that.

17:23.085 --> 17:25.605
I think the UK is always

17:23.085 --> 17:25.605
ready for great food.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.365
And this is great food.

17:27.405 --> 17:29.645
[Lee] They all had, like,

17:27.405 --> 17:29.645
different points to bring up.

17:29.685 --> 17:31.205
It just made you think about

17:31.245 --> 17:34.325
a much broader scheme

17:31.245 --> 17:34.325
of stuff, which is great.

17:34.365 --> 17:36.045
[Jane]<i> So, Jah Jyot.</i>

17:36.085 --> 17:39.045
I thought the product

17:36.085 --> 17:39.045
was actually delicious,

17:36.085 --> 17:39.045
I really enjoyed it.

17:39.085 --> 17:41.205
I've had better chicken tikka,

17:39.085 --> 17:41.205
I've had better dosas,

17:41.245 --> 17:42.925
so it was okay.

17:42.965 --> 17:47.765
There is potentially

17:42.965 --> 17:47.765
a good business there

17:42.965 --> 17:47.765
struggling to get out.

17:47.805 --> 17:50.445
It doesn't have that

17:47.805 --> 17:50.445
<i>je ne c'est quoi,</i> does it?

17:50.485 --> 17:52.005
Correct my pronunciation.

17:52.045 --> 17:54.685
No, no, I mean,

17:52.045 --> 17:54.685
there's nothing to correct.

17:52.045 --> 17:54.685
It's perfect.

17:54.725 --> 17:57.365
Maurice was the scariest

17:54.725 --> 17:57.365
for me, out of all of them.

17:57.405 --> 17:58.565
It was intense.

17:58.605 --> 18:00.845
Investors, we've seen

17:58.605 --> 18:00.845
three very strong ideas.

18:00.885 --> 18:02.525
We're gonna have

18:00.885 --> 18:02.525
to make a decision.

18:02.565 --> 18:05.325
So, we need to work out

18:02.565 --> 18:05.325
who has the most

18:02.565 --> 18:05.325
investment potential,

18:05.365 --> 18:08.005
and who is going to go,

18:05.365 --> 18:08.005
on that basis, to Manchester.

18:10.925 --> 18:15.445
[Fred]<i> Someone is about to be</i>

18:10.925 --> 18:15.445
<i>a step closer to the dream</i>

18:10.925 --> 18:15.445
<i>of their own restaurant.</i>

18:18.685 --> 18:21.565
Right, the time has come.

18:21.605 --> 18:25.525
I've got to tell you

18:21.605 --> 18:25.525
who has the most

18:21.605 --> 18:25.525
investment potential

18:25.565 --> 18:27.725
and who, therefore,

18:25.565 --> 18:27.725
is going to go to Manchester

18:27.765 --> 18:30.405
to run a pop-up

18:27.765 --> 18:30.405
for a couple of days.

18:30.445 --> 18:31.965
So, the business

18:30.445 --> 18:31.965
that's going through

18:32.605 --> 18:34.605
is BBQ Dreamz.

18:35.405 --> 18:36.565
Well done.

18:37.485 --> 18:38.645
[Sinead] Thank you.

18:38.685 --> 18:40.645
Congratulations, guys.

18:38.685 --> 18:40.645
Well done.

18:42.245 --> 18:47.045
BBQ Dreamz, themselves

18:42.245 --> 18:47.045
and their business plan,

18:42.245 --> 18:47.045
were quite humble

18:47.085 --> 18:51.645
<i>unlike one of the other</i>

18:47.085 --> 18:51.645
<i>operators' business plan,</i>

18:47.085 --> 18:51.645
<i>which was very ambitious.</i>

18:51.685 --> 18:53.965
It was actually

18:51.685 --> 18:53.965
a really, really

18:51.685 --> 18:53.965
tough decision.

18:54.005 --> 18:57.405
In the end, I think

18:54.005 --> 18:57.405
we came to BBQ Dreamz

18:57.445 --> 19:00.925
<i>primarily because</i>

18:57.445 --> 19:00.925
<i>the food was among the best</i>

18:57.445 --> 19:00.925
<i>food I've had this year,</i>

19:00.965 --> 19:04.405
and I felt very strongly

19:00.965 --> 19:04.405
that if they could

19:00.965 --> 19:04.405
deliver that consistently

19:04.445 --> 19:07.165
that was kind of

19:04.445 --> 19:07.165
a compelling argument

19:04.445 --> 19:07.165
for investment.

19:07.205 --> 19:08.565
[Fred] I can see how much

19:07.205 --> 19:08.565
it means to you guys.

19:08.605 --> 19:09.845
Thank you, yeah.

19:09.885 --> 19:11.285
And it's nice to see

19:09.885 --> 19:11.285
that you're a couple

19:11.325 --> 19:13.245
who have been working together

19:11.325 --> 19:13.245
for four and a half years.

19:13.285 --> 19:15.725
I think BBQ Dreamz

19:13.285 --> 19:15.725
is a big gamble.

19:15.765 --> 19:19.765
At the end of the day,

19:15.765 --> 19:19.765
there's quite a big,

19:15.765 --> 19:19.765
steep learning curve.

19:19.805 --> 19:22.445
I don't think

19:19.805 --> 19:22.445
the UK mass market's

19:19.805 --> 19:22.445
ready for offal.

19:22.485 --> 19:25.045
I actually think the whole

19:22.485 --> 19:25.045
combination of flavors,

19:25.085 --> 19:27.925
Filipino food, cooking,

19:25.085 --> 19:27.925
it's so many unknowns.

19:27.965 --> 19:30.445
But at the same time,

19:27.965 --> 19:30.445
there's two

19:27.965 --> 19:30.445
very passionate people

19:30.485 --> 19:33.445
who have proven that

19:30.485 --> 19:33.445
they can deliver

19:30.485 --> 19:33.445
something truly wonderful,

19:33.485 --> 19:35.045
and we're going

19:33.485 --> 19:35.045
to give them a shot to see

19:35.085 --> 19:37.165
whether that can actually

19:35.085 --> 19:37.165
translate into a restaurant.

19:37.205 --> 19:38.685
It's a big learning curve.

19:38.725 --> 19:40.445
What are you going to do

19:38.725 --> 19:40.445
with this feedback?

19:40.485 --> 19:43.605
Filipino education

19:40.485 --> 19:43.605
of the British public,

19:40.485 --> 19:43.605
how are you going to do that?

19:43.645 --> 19:45.605
I mean, it's a big,

19:43.645 --> 19:45.605
big, big piece.

19:45.645 --> 19:47.725
-It is big.

19:45.645 --> 19:47.725
-Yeah, we're going

19:45.645 --> 19:47.725
to work on that.

19:47.765 --> 19:50.285
Yeah, but it's something

19:47.765 --> 19:50.285
that we've been doing

19:47.765 --> 19:50.285
for four years now.

19:50.325 --> 19:54.005
And I think that

19:50.325 --> 19:54.005
the business has grown

19:50.325 --> 19:54.005
from strength to strength.

19:54.045 --> 19:56.765
I'd like to see

19:54.045 --> 19:56.765
how capable they are

19:56.805 --> 19:59.485
of actually managing

19:56.805 --> 19:59.485
a busy restaurant.

19:59.525 --> 20:01.045
I'd like to look

19:59.525 --> 20:01.045
at their numbers

20:01.085 --> 20:03.125
and I'd like to see

20:01.085 --> 20:03.125
the quality maintained.

20:03.165 --> 20:04.605
I think we can nail this.

20:04.645 --> 20:06.685
-So, yeah,

20:04.645 --> 20:06.685
we're pretty confident.

20:04.645 --> 20:06.685
-I'm very happy for you.

20:06.725 --> 20:08.045
-Well done.

20:06.725 --> 20:08.045
-Thank you very much.

20:08.085 --> 20:09.165
See you in Manchester, guys.

20:09.205 --> 20:10.445
-See you later.

20:09.205 --> 20:10.445
-Thank you.

Bit of an exciting atmosphere.

[Lee]

21:50.525 --> 21:52.125

21:52.165 --> 21:54.405
I thought Sinead

was incredibly cute.

22:07.845 --> 22:10.525
<i>in the Philippines,</i>

<i>but I was brought up</i>

22:10.565 --> 22:12.325
<i>in Northampton.</i>

22:12.365 --> 22:15.365
<i>So, like, my mum</i>

<i>and a lot of Filipino.</i>

<i>is the proper Northerner</i>

22:15.405 --> 22:18.845
<i>and so, you know,</i>

22:18.885 --> 22:22.445
like dripping on toast

22:18.885 --> 22:22.445
and all these sort of

22:18.885 --> 22:22.445
old-school dishes as well.

22:22.485 --> 22:25.605
<i>So, yeah,</i>

22:22.485 --> 22:25.605
<i>quite a varied cuisine.</i>

22:25.645 --> 22:27.445
-[woman whoops]

22:25.645 --> 22:27.445
-How was that?

22:25.645 --> 22:27.445
Was that beautiful?

22:29.205 --> 22:34.525
So, I grew up in a small town

22:29.205 --> 22:34.525
called Tuam, in County Galway.

22:34.565 --> 22:38.045
<i>I didn't have a great</i>

22:34.565 --> 22:38.045

22:34.565 --> 22:38.045
<i>before I met Lee.</i>

22:38.085 --> 22:39.885
<i>And like, when we'd</i>

22:38.085 --> 22:39.885
<i>go down to his mum's,</i>

22:39.925 --> 22:42.885
<i>you know, she'd have</i>

22:39.925 --> 22:42.885
<i>cooked some food</i>

22:39.925 --> 22:42.885
<i>and I thought it was delicious.</i>

22:42.925 --> 22:44.245
And it just kind of

22:42.925 --> 22:44.245
grew from there.

23:09.165 --> 23:12.525
to remind you, tomorrow

23:09.165 --> 23:12.525

23:20.805 --> 23:23.885
No, the brain is, like,

23:20.805 --> 23:23.885
ticking over constantly.

23:23.925 --> 23:25.685
Who's going to run

23:23.925 --> 23:25.685
the front of house?

23:25.725 --> 23:29.165
It's going to be me.

23:25.725 --> 23:29.165

Filipino face of the company.

23:31.165 --> 23:33.325
-You're cooking?

23:31.165 --> 23:33.325
-Well, yeah, I'm going

23:31.165 --> 23:33.325
to be on the pass,

23:33.365 --> 23:35.045
like garnishing,

23:33.365 --> 23:35.045
getting stuff out.

23:35.085 --> 23:37.165
-Orchestrating, controlling.

23:35.085 --> 23:37.165
-Yeah.

23:37.205 --> 23:39.485
And what are you doing here?

23:37.205 --> 23:39.485
It's a bit like

23:37.205 --> 23:39.485
a French brasserie,

23:39.525 --> 23:40.885
the tables are

23:39.525 --> 23:40.885
so close together.

23:40.925 --> 23:42.765
-Yeah.

23:40.925 --> 23:42.765
-You want to bring

23:40.925 --> 23:42.765
people together?

23:42.805 --> 23:43.885
[Lee] That's exactly it.

23:43.925 --> 23:45.125
Shall I give you a hand

23:43.925 --> 23:45.125
with the tables?

23:45.165 --> 23:46.805
That would be amazing.

23:45.165 --> 23:46.805
Yeah, thank you.

23:48.045 --> 23:49.885
There's something

23:48.045 --> 23:49.885
very therapeutic about

23:49.925 --> 23:51.885
organizing tables

23:49.925 --> 23:51.885
like this in the morning.

23:51.925 --> 23:53.965
-[Lee] Yeah.

23:51.925 --> 23:53.965
-I like it.

23:54.005 --> 23:57.245
What we've got to think about,

23:54.005 --> 23:57.245
if you take both

23:54.005 --> 23:57.245
the seats here...

23:59.445 --> 24:01.925
Can you imagine,

23:59.445 --> 24:01.925
when you're passing, you've got

23:59.445 --> 24:01.925
to have enough space.

24:01.965 --> 24:03.045
You've got to think

24:01.965 --> 24:03.045
about that one.

24:04.805 --> 24:07.605
It's a small thing,

24:04.805 --> 24:07.605
but it means that you have

24:04.805 --> 24:07.605
thought about all this.

24:07.645 --> 24:09.485
-This is about

24:07.645 --> 24:09.485
the first impression.

24:07.645 --> 24:09.485
-[Lee] Absolutely, yeah.

24:09.525 --> 24:11.765
Anyway, look, guys.

24:09.525 --> 24:11.765
You've got a lot to do.

24:09.525 --> 24:11.765
I'll see you later on.

24:11.805 --> 24:13.605
See you later.

24:11.805 --> 24:13.605
Good luck. Take care.

24:15.165 --> 24:17.005
[Lee] All right, dude.

24:17.045 --> 24:19.005
-[Joe] How you doing?

24:17.045 --> 24:19.005
-Yeah. Good. How are you?

24:19.045 --> 24:21.165
Welcome to BBQ Dreamz.

24:21.205 --> 24:24.285
[Fred]<i> 11:00 a.m.,</i>

24:21.205 --> 24:24.285
<i>six hours till they open.</i>

24:24.325 --> 24:28.405
<i>Lee and Sinead have brought</i>

24:24.325 --> 24:28.405
<i>the team from their food truck</i>

24:24.325 --> 24:28.405
<i>to help them win investment.</i>

24:29.965 --> 24:31.565
[Sinead]

24:29.965 --> 24:31.565
This is the main thing.

24:31.605 --> 24:35.645
We need to get the pork belly

24:31.605 --> 24:35.645
and score the skin

24:31.605 --> 24:35.645
and then salt them

24:35.685 --> 24:38.205
so that when we fry it,

24:35.685 --> 24:38.205
it goes crispy.

24:38.245 --> 24:40.965
[Fred]<i> Tonight will be</i>

24:38.245 --> 24:40.965
<i>their soft launch.</i>

24:41.005 --> 24:42.285
[Lee] Push, push, chefs.

24:41.005 --> 24:42.285
Push, push.

24:42.325 --> 24:44.285
[Fred]<i> It's a standard</i>

24:42.325 --> 24:44.285
<i>industry practice.</i>

24:44.325 --> 24:46.445
<i>Customers will pay</i>

24:44.325 --> 24:46.445
<i>just half price</i>

24:46.485 --> 24:50.485
<i>as BBQ Dreamz road-test</i>

24:46.485 --> 24:50.485
<i>their operation and food.</i>

24:50.525 --> 24:52.485
[Lee]<i> Filipino cuisine</i>

24:50.525 --> 24:52.485
<i>is very rice-based.</i>

24:52.525 --> 24:55.005
A lot of chicken and pork.

24:55.045 --> 24:58.045
A lot of roasted meats.

24:55.045 --> 24:58.045
A lot of dipping sauces.

24:58.685 --> 25:00.285
<i>It's not very spicy,</i>

25:00.325 --> 25:04.125
but we use quite punchy

25:00.325 --> 25:04.125
but warming flavors.

25:09.965 --> 25:13.125
The investors have one

25:09.965 --> 25:13.125
big issue with BBQ Dreamz.

25:13.165 --> 25:16.365
Filipino food is virtually

25:13.165 --> 25:16.365
unknown in the UK.

25:16.405 --> 25:19.885
The public needs educating,

25:16.405 --> 25:19.885
and that's a big ask.

25:19.925 --> 25:22.805
Lee and Sinead need to make

25:19.925 --> 25:22.805
their food accessible.

25:25.005 --> 25:29.605
<i>The couple have tried</i>

25:25.005 --> 25:29.605
<i>to design a Filipino menu</i>

25:25.005 --> 25:29.605
<i>to suit British tastes.</i>

25:29.645 --> 25:31.485
Yes. That looks

25:29.645 --> 25:31.485
so good, doesn't it?

25:31.525 --> 25:33.125
Well done.

25:35.885 --> 25:38.485
[Fred]<i> Adobo,</i>

25:35.885 --> 25:38.485
<i>the Filipino national dish,</i>

25:38.525 --> 25:42.445
<i>is a simple chicken stew</i>

25:38.525 --> 25:42.445
<i>flavored with</i>

25:38.525 --> 25:42.445
<i>soy and vinegar.</i>

25:42.485 --> 25:44.205
<i>It sells for £8.</i>

25:46.605 --> 25:51.605
<i>Lechon kawali,</i>

25:46.605 --> 25:51.605
<i>the crispy pork belly that</i>

25:46.605 --> 25:51.605
<i>previously wowed the investors</i>

25:51.645 --> 25:53.405
<i>is also £8.</i>

25:54.965 --> 25:57.965
<i>And the classic</i>

25:54.965 --> 25:57.965
<i>and delicious Manila snack,</i>

25:58.005 --> 26:02.525
<i>prawns marinated</i>

25:58.005 --> 26:02.525
<i>in lemongrass, ginger</i>

25:58.005 --> 26:02.525
<i>and garlic, is £6.</i>

26:04.485 --> 26:06.365
<i>It all looks very appealing,</i>

26:06.405 --> 26:09.165
<i>but I want to know why</i>

26:06.405 --> 26:09.165
<i>Lee and Sinead are sticking</i>

26:09.205 --> 26:12.645
<i>with their most</i>

26:09.205 --> 26:12.645
<i>challenging dish</i>

26:09.205 --> 26:12.645
<i>despite the investors' worries.</i>

26:16.605 --> 26:18.325
So, what are you doing here?

26:18.365 --> 26:20.765
So, I'm just preparing

26:18.365 --> 26:20.765
our duck hearts for tonight.

26:20.805 --> 26:23.205
[Fred]

26:20.805 --> 26:23.205
The investors did pick up

26:20.805 --> 26:23.205
on that in London.

26:23.245 --> 26:26.965
In terms of Filipino food

26:23.245 --> 26:26.965
and how known

26:23.245 --> 26:26.965
it was in the UK.

26:27.005 --> 26:28.605
No, it's not.

26:28.645 --> 26:30.325
How are you going

26:28.645 --> 26:30.325
to convince the public

26:28.645 --> 26:30.325
that this is good to eat?

26:30.365 --> 26:33.405
Yeah, I think we make

26:30.365 --> 26:33.405
a really good satay sauce.

26:33.445 --> 26:35.285
Which is really

26:33.445 --> 26:35.285
well-known and familiar.

26:35.325 --> 26:37.965
So, people might not

26:35.325 --> 26:37.965
be that keen to try,

26:38.005 --> 26:40.365
but I think once they do

26:38.005 --> 26:40.365
and they taste the flavor

26:38.005 --> 26:40.365
of the satay...

26:40.405 --> 26:43.805
I mean, you don't have

26:40.405 --> 26:43.805
to convince me, I'm French,

26:40.405 --> 26:43.805
I'll eat anything.

26:43.845 --> 26:45.885
But obviously,

26:43.845 --> 26:45.885
there lots of other things

26:43.845 --> 26:45.885
on the menu as well

26:45.925 --> 26:48.525
like wings and prawn skewers

26:45.925 --> 26:48.525
and things,

26:48.565 --> 26:50.645
so we'll see how

26:48.565 --> 26:50.645
people feel about it.

26:50.685 --> 26:52.125
-It's going to be all right.

26:50.685 --> 26:52.125
-Thank you.

[Scott]

[Jane]

27:50.645 --> 27:53.005
<i>I think the British public</i>

27:50.645 --> 27:53.005
<i>are open to new foods,</i>

27:53.045 --> 27:56.325

27:53.045 --> 27:56.325
amount of patience and a huge

27:53.045 --> 27:56.325
amount of effort to build,

27:56.365 --> 27:59.645
and particularly a brand

27:56.365 --> 27:59.645

27:56.365 --> 27:59.645

But Filipino street food

28:03.605 --> 28:05.685
that's offal...

28:08.645 --> 28:09.885
Bit more of a challenge.

[Fred]<i> Charlie McVeigh</i>

28:16.885 --> 28:20.965
<i>for £16 million.</i>

28:21.005 --> 28:24.605
The big question

28:21.005 --> 28:24.605
that BBQ Dreamz

28:21.005 --> 28:24.605
needs to answer tonight is,

28:24.645 --> 28:27.005
<i>can you always</i>

28:24.645 --> 28:27.005
<i>make pork that good?</i>

28:27.045 --> 28:29.765
I don't know,

28:27.045 --> 28:29.765
but they have to.

28:29.805 --> 28:32.765
<i>The consistency of the food</i>

28:32.805 --> 28:35.485
<i>customers won't return</i>

28:32.805 --> 28:35.485
<i>once they've been once</i>

28:35.525 --> 28:38.645
and there's no way

28:35.525 --> 28:38.645
we can roll this restaurant

28:35.525 --> 28:38.645
out into more locations.

28:48.685 --> 28:50.965
<i>to a chain</i>

28:48.685 --> 28:50.965
<i>of sushi restaurants.</i>

28:51.005 --> 28:54.925
There are different ways

28:51.005 --> 28:54.925
this could actually become

28:51.005 --> 28:54.925
a restaurant operation.

28:54.965 --> 28:57.605
It could be a grab and go,

28:54.965 --> 28:57.605
so when you go in

28:57.645 --> 29:00.765
you actually just

28:57.645 --> 29:00.765
order at the counter,

28:57.645 --> 29:00.765
you take it away and go.

29:00.805 --> 29:03.125
<i>Or it could be more</i>

29:00.805 --> 29:03.125
<i>of a sit-down restaurant</i>

29:03.165 --> 29:06.125
<i>and actually have</i>

30:29.205 --> 30:31.685
-Thanks, Fred.

30:31.725 --> 30:35.605
Hello, guys!

30:31.725 --> 30:35.605
Welcome to BBQ Dreamz,

30:31.725 --> 30:35.605
you're the first.

30:35.645 --> 30:37.885
For the two of you,

30:35.645 --> 30:37.885
I would throw in

30:35.645 --> 30:37.885
a couple of larges,

30:37.925 --> 30:39.485
a couple of lighter dishes

30:37.925 --> 30:39.485
and maybe a couple of sides.

30:39.525 --> 30:40.965
We always over-order.

30:41.005 --> 30:43.005
[Fred]

30:41.005 --> 30:43.005
<i>The food may be half price...</i>

30:43.045 --> 30:46.045
One wings.

30:43.045 --> 30:46.045
One skewers, prawn.

30:47.125 --> 30:49.085
<i>...but as</i>

30:47.125 --> 30:49.085
<i>the investors feared,</i>

30:49.125 --> 30:52.205
<i>some customers are struggling</i>

30:49.125 --> 30:52.205
<i>with unfamiliar dishes.</i>

30:54.445 --> 30:57.565
I've never really

30:54.445 --> 30:57.565
had Filipino cuisine,

30:57.605 --> 30:59.885
so it's all, like, new to me,

30:57.605 --> 30:59.885
to be honest.

30:59.925 --> 31:01.645
Would you recommend

30:59.925 --> 31:01.645
the duck heart?

31:01.685 --> 31:04.405
We did have some earlier

31:01.685 --> 31:04.405
and it was really good.

31:01.685 --> 31:04.405
Really good.

31:06.325 --> 31:07.845
We're gonna start you

31:06.325 --> 31:07.845
with the duck hearts, Fred.

31:07.885 --> 31:09.365
-Thank you very much.

31:07.885 --> 31:09.365
-You're very welcome.

31:09.405 --> 31:11.405
-Brilliant.

31:09.405 --> 31:11.405
-Just get the lime

31:09.405 --> 31:11.405
on there as well.

31:16.485 --> 31:18.685
Oh, this is so tender.

31:18.725 --> 31:20.805
The flavor, it's amazing.

31:20.845 --> 31:23.445
I mean, if anybody

31:20.845 --> 31:23.445
doesn't like that,

31:20.845 --> 31:23.445
they're missing out.

31:23.485 --> 31:25.725
You've got to try it. Oh!

31:27.565 --> 31:29.205
[Fred]<i> 6:45 p.m.,</i>

31:29.245 --> 31:31.885
<i>an hour and a half</i>

31:29.245 --> 31:31.885
<i>into the soft launch.</i>

31:31.925 --> 31:34.005
There's four of you,

31:31.925 --> 31:34.005
isn't there, yeah?

31:34.045 --> 31:37.085
[Fred]<i> Tonight's most important</i>

31:34.045 --> 31:37.085
<i>diners are about to arrive.</i>

31:40.925 --> 31:42.325
[Scott]

31:40.925 --> 31:42.325
<i>Soft launches go wrong,</i>

31:42.365 --> 31:45.965
that may not necessarily

31:42.365 --> 31:45.965
be down to the operator.

31:46.005 --> 31:47.645
It could be a power cut.

31:47.685 --> 31:51.005
It could be someone

31:47.685 --> 31:51.005
getting assassinated

31:47.685 --> 31:51.005
outside your pub,

31:51.045 --> 31:53.685
which happened

31:51.045 --> 31:53.685
at my first pub

31:51.045 --> 31:53.685
when it opened.

31:53.725 --> 31:55.485
So, put that

31:53.725 --> 31:55.485
in your business plan.

31:57.125 --> 31:58.965
-Hi.

31:57.125 --> 31:58.965
-Hi, hello.

31:59.005 --> 32:00.885
-How are you?

31:59.005 --> 32:00.885
-[Lee] Good, how are you?

32:00.925 --> 32:03.485
Oh, we're very excited.

32:00.925 --> 32:03.485
And you'll be pleased

32:00.925 --> 32:03.485
to know, hungry.

32:05.125 --> 32:08.525
I'm not convinced

32:05.125 --> 32:08.525
Filipino is going to be

32:05.125 --> 32:08.525
the next big thing,

32:08.565 --> 32:11.725
but I am convinced

32:08.565 --> 32:11.725
that street food

32:08.565 --> 32:11.725
is very, very popular.

32:11.765 --> 32:13.725
[Sinead]

32:11.765 --> 32:13.725
Can I get a chicken adobo?

32:13.765 --> 32:18.605
And food which translates

32:13.765 --> 32:18.605
well into that environment

32:13.765 --> 32:18.605
has lots of appeal.

32:18.645 --> 32:20.445
What they've

32:18.645 --> 32:20.445
done very cleverly,

32:18.645 --> 32:20.445
is they've put the names

32:20.485 --> 32:22.685
of the things

32:20.485 --> 32:22.685
that we know first,

32:20.485 --> 32:22.685
which is good.

32:22.725 --> 32:25.885
So grilled satay, prawn,

32:22.725 --> 32:25.885
grilled aubergine.

32:25.925 --> 32:29.365
Honestly, I wouldn't have

32:25.925 --> 32:29.365
come to Manchester

32:25.925 --> 32:29.365
if I wasn't excited about this.

32:29.405 --> 32:33.645
I haven't seen

32:29.405 --> 32:33.645
what BBQ Dreamz has

32:29.405 --> 32:33.645
before in the market.

32:33.685 --> 32:35.365
The food smells amazing

32:33.685 --> 32:35.365
when you walk in,

32:35.405 --> 32:37.685
that's really important, yeah.

32:37.725 --> 32:40.005
There's something

32:37.725 --> 32:40.005
about BBQ Dreamz

32:37.725 --> 32:40.005
that excites me.

32:40.045 --> 32:42.085
<i>It started with</i>

32:40.045 --> 32:42.085
<i>this incredible pork dish.</i>

32:42.845 --> 32:44.125
Service!

32:44.165 --> 32:46.205
If I like BBQ Dreamz

32:44.165 --> 32:46.205
enough, I'll fight to invest.

32:48.645 --> 32:50.685
So, we had

32:48.645 --> 32:50.685
the pork belly last time.

32:50.725 --> 32:53.005
Are we going to get one

32:50.725 --> 32:53.005
of those again to see if it's

32:50.725 --> 32:53.005
the same when they execute it.

32:53.045 --> 32:55.245
I reckon we can

32:53.045 --> 32:55.245
do all of it

32:53.045 --> 32:55.245
if its staggered nicely.

32:55.285 --> 32:56.325
Yeah, okay.

32:56.365 --> 32:57.765
[Lee] How are we doing?

32:57.805 --> 32:59.085
[Jane] I'm really

32:57.805 --> 32:59.085
sorry about this,

32:59.125 --> 33:00.605
but we've decided that

32:59.125 --> 33:00.605
we're going to eat the menu.

33:00.645 --> 33:02.685
I think that's the best way.

33:00.645 --> 33:02.685
Absolutely, yeah.

33:03.645 --> 33:04.925
Cool, all right.

33:07.285 --> 33:09.125
[Justin]

33:07.285 --> 33:09.125
So, I've got wings,

33:07.285 --> 33:09.125
coriander salad.

33:09.165 --> 33:11.565
-[Sinead] And you've got

33:09.165 --> 33:11.565
these duck hearts.

33:09.165 --> 33:11.565
-[Richard] Duck hearts, yeah.

33:12.565 --> 33:14.085
Sorry, guys,

33:12.565 --> 33:14.085
excuse the interruption.

33:14.125 --> 33:15.445
I'm going to start

33:14.125 --> 33:15.445
plating down.

33:15.485 --> 33:17.965
You can put it all there

33:15.485 --> 33:17.965
in front of me if you like.

33:18.005 --> 33:19.925
[Charlie]<i> So, the menu</i>

33:18.005 --> 33:19.925
<i>has got one very</i>

33:18.005 --> 33:19.925
<i>challenging dish on it,</i>

33:19.965 --> 33:22.125
<i>duck hearts on a skewer.</i>

33:22.165 --> 33:24.205
Is that something

33:22.165 --> 33:24.205
people want to eat?

33:22.165 --> 33:24.205
Probably not.

33:24.245 --> 33:26.525
Is it something that

33:24.245 --> 33:26.525
people will talk about?

33:24.245 --> 33:26.525
Absolutely.

33:27.325 --> 33:28.605
Keen on the duck heart?

33:28.645 --> 33:30.725
I'm not really

33:28.645 --> 33:30.725
a big offal eater,

33:30.765 --> 33:32.605
but I'm very happy to try it.

33:36.725 --> 33:38.605
It just tastes

33:36.725 --> 33:38.605
incredibly original.

33:38.645 --> 33:40.165
[Jane] I've never eaten

33:38.645 --> 33:40.165
a duck heart before in my life.

33:40.205 --> 33:41.845
Well, cheers to you

33:40.205 --> 33:41.845
for trying it.

33:41.885 --> 33:43.365
To Jane and her duck heart.

33:44.365 --> 33:45.765
Might be my last duck heart

33:45.805 --> 33:47.445
if I'm being brutally honest.

33:48.965 --> 33:50.925
My favorite today

33:48.965 --> 33:50.925
is the cauliflower.

33:50.965 --> 33:53.605
I think the cauliflower

33:50.965 --> 33:53.605
is heroic.

33:53.645 --> 33:54.765
[Maurice]

33:53.645 --> 33:54.765
That is really good.

33:54.805 --> 33:55.965
Do you want

33:54.805 --> 33:55.965
another cauliflower?

33:56.525 --> 33:57.925
I think we should.

33:57.965 --> 33:59.885
[Sinead] Service!

33:59.925 --> 34:02.525
So, this is the lechon kawali,

33:59.925 --> 34:02.525
the pork that

33:59.925 --> 34:02.525
some of us thought

34:02.565 --> 34:04.925
was the best thing

34:02.565 --> 34:04.925
we'd eaten all year

34:02.565 --> 34:04.925
when we had it in London.

34:04.965 --> 34:07.045
And you are craving it

34:04.965 --> 34:07.045
and have been craving it.

34:07.085 --> 34:09.405
I have been craving it.

34:07.085 --> 34:09.405
I have been craving it!

34:09.445 --> 34:12.645
You said it was

34:09.445 --> 34:12.645
one of the best bits

34:09.445 --> 34:12.645
of pork you've ever had.

34:17.645 --> 34:19.725
-I don't think it's as good.

34:17.645 --> 34:19.725
-[Scott] It isn't.

34:19.765 --> 34:21.365
It hasn't got

34:19.765 --> 34:21.365
the same crackling,

34:21.405 --> 34:23.325
I don't think the fat's

34:21.405 --> 34:23.325
rendered down enough.

34:23.365 --> 34:25.645
I think they just

34:23.365 --> 34:25.645
haven't fried it enough,

34:23.365 --> 34:25.645
do you not think?

34:25.685 --> 34:28.205
I can't notice the flavors.

34:25.685 --> 34:28.205
Where are the flavors in it?

34:28.245 --> 34:30.965
[Lee] Ah, Sin, I feel that

34:28.245 --> 34:30.965
we're starting to fall behind.

34:31.005 --> 34:32.205
[Sinead] Yeah, we are.

34:33.285 --> 34:34.885
[Scott] Now that's

34:33.285 --> 34:34.885
a different color.

34:34.925 --> 34:36.565
[Jane] That doesn't

34:34.925 --> 34:36.565
look the same, does it?

34:36.605 --> 34:40.085
This definitely doesn't

34:36.605 --> 34:40.085
look the same as

34:36.605 --> 34:40.085
the one we just had.

34:40.125 --> 34:43.845
Lee, can I ask you,

34:40.125 --> 34:43.845
this cauliflower,

34:43.885 --> 34:47.125
the first portion we had

34:43.885 --> 34:47.125
was really roasted

34:43.885 --> 34:47.125
and charred.

34:47.165 --> 34:49.165
Was that overdone

34:47.165 --> 34:49.165
and this underdone?

34:49.205 --> 34:50.485
-How's it supposed to be?

34:49.205 --> 34:50.485
-[Jane] They're very different.

34:50.525 --> 34:52.965
It's meant to be dark

34:50.525 --> 34:52.965
and crispy, yeah.

34:53.005 --> 34:55.365
And the pork,

34:53.005 --> 34:55.365
this is still very good.

34:55.405 --> 34:57.765
When we had it

34:55.405 --> 34:57.765
on its own the first time,

34:57.805 --> 34:59.965
there was a lot more

34:57.805 --> 34:59.965
of the spices from that

34:57.805 --> 34:59.965
sous vide, you see.

35:00.005 --> 35:02.245
To be honest,

35:00.005 --> 35:02.245
I got my aromatics

35:00.005 --> 35:02.245
slightly wrong.

35:02.285 --> 35:04.205
So, I actually didn't put in

35:02.285 --> 35:04.205
as much as I should have.

35:04.245 --> 35:06.365
Oh, that is why

35:04.245 --> 35:06.365
you couldn't taste it.

35:08.005 --> 35:11.965
Stress level eight.

35:08.005 --> 35:11.965
That's kind of where

35:08.005 --> 35:11.965
I am at the moment.

35:12.005 --> 35:14.325
-How are you guys?

35:12.005 --> 35:14.325
-We are living the dream.

35:14.365 --> 35:16.285
So here is the $1 million

35:14.365 --> 35:16.285
question now.

35:17.805 --> 35:19.445
Are you interested

35:17.805 --> 35:19.445
in investing?

35:19.485 --> 35:22.325
My concerns remain,

35:19.485 --> 35:22.325
and they still remain,

35:22.365 --> 35:25.005
I think there is

35:22.365 --> 35:25.005
a huge amount of work to do

35:25.045 --> 35:28.285
to take what is great food

35:25.045 --> 35:28.285
and put it into a restaurant.

35:28.325 --> 35:30.645
And do I think it's possible?

35:28.325 --> 35:30.645
Yes, I think it's possible.

35:30.685 --> 35:32.765
Do I think it's something

35:30.685 --> 35:32.765
that I want to do?

35:32.805 --> 35:35.285
This probably

35:32.805 --> 35:35.285
isn't right up there,

35:32.805 --> 35:35.285
if I'm being brutally honest.

35:35.325 --> 35:37.045
Because I think

35:35.325 --> 35:37.045
the challenge is huge.

35:37.085 --> 35:41.205
I would happily put

35:37.085 --> 35:41.205
my hand in my pocket

35:37.085 --> 35:41.205
for this meal, undoubtedly.

35:41.245 --> 35:44.685
But it's going to be

35:41.245 --> 35:44.685
a deeper conversation

35:41.245 --> 35:44.685
with those guys tomorrow

35:44.725 --> 35:47.525
-about how they...

35:44.725 --> 35:47.525
Their big vision.

35:44.725 --> 35:47.525
-[Charlie] Very well put.

35:49.645 --> 35:54.045
[Fred]<i> 9:00 p.m.</i>

35:49.645 --> 35:54.045
<i>The first of BBQ Dreamz's two</i>

35:49.645 --> 35:54.045
<i>restaurant services is over.</i>

35:55.965 --> 35:58.045
<i>Consistency was</i>

35:55.965 --> 35:58.045

35:58.085 --> 36:02.365

36:02.405 --> 36:07.045

36:02.405 --> 36:07.045
the food enough

36:02.405 --> 36:07.045
to still consider investing.

36:07.085 --> 36:09.885
But they've still got

36:07.085 --> 36:09.885
a long way to go.

36:09.925 --> 36:12.445
I'm looking forward

36:09.925 --> 36:12.445
to sitting down with

36:09.925 --> 36:12.445
Lee and Sinead tomorrow

36:12.485 --> 36:17.125
and just finding out

36:12.485 --> 36:17.125
what they want

36:12.485 --> 36:17.125
in terms of an investment.

36:17.165 --> 36:22.325
I initially thought

36:17.165 --> 36:22.325
this was going to be

36:17.165 --> 36:22.325
a takeaway-type operation.

36:22.365 --> 36:24.925
<i>But now this is</i>

36:22.365 --> 36:24.925
<i>more of a restaurant.</i>

36:24.965 --> 36:27.845
<i>I wasn't particularly looking</i>

36:24.965 --> 36:27.845
<i>at that sector at the moment.</i>

36:27.885 --> 36:30.365
I've got to think

36:27.885 --> 36:30.365
a little bit more

36:27.885 --> 36:30.365
deeply about this,

36:30.405 --> 36:32.765
because the food

36:30.405 --> 36:32.765
was as good as I...

36:32.805 --> 36:34.245
You know,

36:32.805 --> 36:34.245
as good as it gets,

36:34.285 --> 36:37.205
and that's something

36:34.285 --> 36:37.205
you don't often get.

36:37.245 --> 36:38.885
-How are you?

36:37.245 --> 36:38.885
-[Lee] Hi, yeah, good.

36:38.925 --> 36:40.765
It was hard,

36:38.925 --> 36:40.765
it was definitely hard.

36:40.805 --> 36:45.005
Yeah. It definitely had

36:40.805 --> 36:45.005
its highs and lows

36:40.805 --> 36:45.005
throughout the night.

36:45.045 --> 36:47.525
What I look for in a room

36:45.045 --> 36:47.525
full of people eating food

36:47.565 --> 36:49.765
is are people waving

36:47.565 --> 36:49.765
their hands around and going,

36:49.805 --> 36:52.325
you know, "I need attention"

36:49.805 --> 36:52.325
or "I'm not happy with this."

36:52.365 --> 36:53.805
There was none of that

36:52.365 --> 36:53.805
kind of body language.

36:53.845 --> 36:55.245
Thank you, bye.

36:55.285 --> 36:58.285
What we have to try

36:55.285 --> 36:58.285
and establish tomorrow

36:58.325 --> 37:00.805
<i>is whether they have</i>

36:58.325 --> 37:00.805
<i>any idea about numbers.</i>

37:00.845 --> 37:03.125
Do they know their way

37:00.845 --> 37:03.125
around a pound note?

37:03.165 --> 37:04.885
[Fred]<i> BBQ Dreamz</i>

37:03.165 --> 37:04.885
<i>have impressed,</i>

37:04.925 --> 37:08.445
<i>but did they do enough</i>

37:04.925 --> 37:08.445
<i>to win over the most</i>

37:04.925 --> 37:08.445
<i>skeptical investor?</i>

37:08.485 --> 37:12.085
I think

37:08.485 --> 37:12.085
mainstream Filipino food

37:08.485 --> 37:12.085
is a little way off.

37:12.125 --> 37:14.965
<i>It requires lots of patience,</i>

37:12.125 --> 37:14.965
<i>a lot of time,</i>

37:12.125 --> 37:14.965
<i>a lot of resources</i>

37:15.005 --> 37:16.765
<i>to educate the public,</i>

37:16.805 --> 37:20.445
to get their heads around

37:16.805 --> 37:20.445
a casual dining offering

37:16.805 --> 37:20.445
in the Filipino space.

37:20.485 --> 37:23.205
But I think that

37:20.485 --> 37:23.205
the amount of work it's

37:20.485 --> 37:23.205
going to take to get there

37:23.245 --> 37:26.045
<i>requires more time</i>

37:23.245 --> 37:26.045
<i>than I have available.</i>

37:26.085 --> 37:27.165
Thank you.

37:28.925 --> 37:31.725
So that leaves me,

37:28.925 --> 37:31.725
tonight, going home.

37:33.365 --> 37:34.845
I'm not going to invest.

37:52.805 --> 37:55.045
[Fred]<i> BBQ Dreamz</i>

37:52.805 --> 37:55.045
<i>were impressive last night</i>

37:55.085 --> 37:58.165
<i>but Lee and Sinead</i>

37:55.085 --> 37:58.165
<i>have so much more to do today.</i>

37:59.325 --> 38:01.045
[Lee] Morning.

38:01.085 --> 38:03.525
[Fred]

38:01.085 --> 38:03.525
<i>The investors want to see</i>

38:01.085 --> 38:03.525
<i>their financial plans</i>

38:03.565 --> 38:07.405
<i>before putting them through</i>

38:03.565 --> 38:07.405
<i>a last lunch service.</i>

38:07.445 --> 38:10.245
<i>But first, I have to</i>

38:07.445 --> 38:10.245
<i>give them the news about Jane.</i>

38:10.285 --> 38:11.565
Morning.

38:11.605 --> 38:13.285
-[Lee] Ah, good morning.

38:11.605 --> 38:13.285
-You feeling good?

38:13.325 --> 38:15.325
Quite nervous. But excited.

38:17.045 --> 38:19.205
-It's a big day.

38:17.045 --> 38:19.205
-Yeah, it's a really big day.

38:19.245 --> 38:20.445
I've got some bad news.

38:21.965 --> 38:24.005
One of the investors is out.

38:24.045 --> 38:26.565
-Jane has decided

38:24.045 --> 38:26.565
that it wasn't for her.

38:24.045 --> 38:26.565
-Okay.

38:26.605 --> 38:29.165
She doesn't believe that

38:26.605 --> 38:29.165
you're ready yet

38:29.205 --> 38:33.525
and she just can't

38:29.205 --> 38:33.525
spend the time to develop

38:29.205 --> 38:33.525
BBQ Dreamz with you.

38:33.565 --> 38:35.725
Sure, okay.

38:35.765 --> 38:39.925
So, there's only three

38:35.765 --> 38:39.925
business meetings

38:35.765 --> 38:39.925
this morning.

38:39.965 --> 38:42.285
I think that

38:39.965 --> 38:42.285
you can run a restaurant,

38:39.965 --> 38:42.285
what you did last night.

38:42.325 --> 38:45.845
But you're not here

38:42.325 --> 38:45.845
to show how good you are

38:42.325 --> 38:45.845
as restaurateurs.

38:45.885 --> 38:48.885
Remember what you're here for.

38:45.885 --> 38:48.885
You are here to get

38:45.885 --> 38:48.885
an investment.

38:48.925 --> 38:51.725
Make sure that

38:48.925 --> 38:51.725
you know your figures,

38:48.925 --> 38:51.725
know your numbers.

38:51.765 --> 38:54.405
You've got to go in

38:51.765 --> 38:54.405
really confident.

38:54.445 --> 38:56.525
-Listen, good luck.

38:54.445 --> 38:56.525
-Thank you. Bye.

39:00.645 --> 39:02.205
[Lee]

39:00.645 --> 39:02.205
As much as I didn't think

39:00.645 --> 39:02.205
it would,

39:02.245 --> 39:04.765
Jane O'Riordan

39:02.245 --> 39:04.765
dropping out kind of

39:02.245 --> 39:04.765
made me go, "Huh."

39:04.805 --> 39:06.885
Brings you back down to earth

39:04.805 --> 39:06.885
a little bit, doesn't it?

39:06.925 --> 39:11.525
I wonder what it is.

39:06.925 --> 39:11.525
The food, the concept,

39:06.925 --> 39:11.525
us ourselves.

39:11.565 --> 39:14.205
-No idea what's going on

39:11.565 --> 39:14.205
in people's, like...

39:11.565 --> 39:14.205
-Mmm.

39:18.445 --> 39:22.965
[Fred]<i> Lee and Sinead now face</i>

39:18.445 --> 39:22.965
<i>meetings to interrogate</i>

39:18.445 --> 39:22.965
<i>their financial strategy.</i>

39:23.005 --> 39:26.325
<i>As the investors</i>

39:23.005 --> 39:26.325
<i>are in competition</i>

39:23.005 --> 39:26.325
<i>with each other,</i>

39:26.365 --> 39:28.205
<i>they'll each have</i>

39:26.365 --> 39:28.205
<i>an hour alone.</i>

39:28.245 --> 39:30.005
[Charlie]<i> The business</i>

39:28.245 --> 39:30.005
<i>meeting is absolutely vital.</i>

39:30.045 --> 39:32.845
I need to believe

39:30.045 --> 39:32.845
that these guys

39:30.045 --> 39:32.845
can do it themselves

39:32.885 --> 39:34.685
because I'm not going

39:32.885 --> 39:34.685
to be there every day

39:34.725 --> 39:37.365
making sure that

39:34.725 --> 39:37.365
the lechon kawali

39:34.725 --> 39:37.365
is crispy on top,

39:37.405 --> 39:39.445
making sure that the staff

39:37.405 --> 39:39.445
turn up to work,

39:39.485 --> 39:41.285
<i>making sure that</i>

39:39.485 --> 39:41.285
<i>the toilets are clean.</i>

39:41.325 --> 39:44.005
[Maurice]<i> They've got to</i>

39:41.325 --> 39:44.005
<i>understand the numbers.</i>

39:44.045 --> 39:48.245
Is there enough margin

39:44.045 --> 39:48.245
after your food,

39:44.045 --> 39:48.245
your labor costs?

39:48.285 --> 39:49.565
-Hello.

39:48.285 --> 39:49.565
-[Sinead] Hello.

39:49.605 --> 39:52.245
If they can't make a profit,

39:49.605 --> 39:52.245
I won't be investing.

39:53.045 --> 39:54.845
-Morning.

39:53.045 --> 39:54.845
-[Sinead] Morning.

39:54.885 --> 39:56.285
[Scott]

39:54.885 --> 39:56.285
<i>It's 100% a marriage.</i>

39:56.325 --> 39:57.645
-Lee.

39:56.325 --> 39:57.645
-How are you?

39:57.685 --> 39:59.445
Probably better than you two.

39:59.485 --> 40:01.525
And it doesn't matter how much

39:59.485 --> 40:01.525
paper work you've got,

40:01.565 --> 40:02.965
like a wedding certificate,

40:03.885 --> 40:05.485
it can still hit the fan.

40:09.165 --> 40:15.205
[Fred]<i> Lee and Sinead</i>

40:09.165 --> 40:15.205
<i>are looking for an investment</i>

40:09.165 --> 40:15.205
<i>of £350,000.</i>

40:15.245 --> 40:18.485
<i>But if their figures</i>

40:15.245 --> 40:18.485
<i>don't add up, the investors</i>

40:15.245 --> 40:18.485
<i>could walk away.</i>

40:20.885 --> 40:22.445
So, who does

40:20.885 --> 40:22.445
all your accounting?

40:22.485 --> 40:24.445
Who put together this plan?

40:24.485 --> 40:25.805
That was myself, yeah.

40:27.485 --> 40:31.565
I've got some quite serious

40:27.485 --> 40:31.565
reservations about

40:27.485 --> 40:31.565
the business plan.

40:31.605 --> 40:33.485
-Well, or lack of.

40:31.605 --> 40:33.485
-Mmm-hmm.

40:34.525 --> 40:36.005
There's a lot of holes.

40:39.765 --> 40:43.285
You've got sales projections

40:39.765 --> 40:43.285
of £1 million here.

40:43.325 --> 40:46.765
Twenty grand a week roughly,

40:43.325 --> 40:46.765
that's quite ambitious.

40:48.605 --> 40:51.085
What makes you think

40:48.605 --> 40:51.085
you'll actually generate

40:48.605 --> 40:51.085
those sales?

40:51.845 --> 40:53.045
Um...

40:57.245 --> 40:59.245
I think it's just

40:57.245 --> 40:59.245
a unique product.

41:01.525 --> 41:05.645
They're not numbers people,

41:01.525 --> 41:05.645
and that is my issue here.

41:05.685 --> 41:09.285
Right now, Lee and Sinead

41:05.685 --> 41:09.285
are in the pitch

41:05.685 --> 41:09.285
of their lives.

41:09.325 --> 41:14.205
They're asking for £350,000

41:09.325 --> 41:14.205
to take Filipino food

41:09.325 --> 41:14.205
to the high street.

41:14.245 --> 41:16.325
<i>They believe in the concept,</i>

41:16.365 --> 41:18.285
<i>but will the investors</i>

41:16.365 --> 41:18.285
<i>feel the same?</i>

41:18.325 --> 41:20.245
[Scott]

41:18.325 --> 41:20.245
Rather than the financials,

41:20.285 --> 41:22.245
I'm trying to work out

41:20.285 --> 41:22.245
what you're looking for.

41:23.285 --> 41:24.725
I think we need

41:23.285 --> 41:24.725
a bit more support

41:24.765 --> 41:27.285
in the logistics of contracts

41:24.765 --> 41:27.285
and all that sort of stuff.

41:28.285 --> 41:30.605
Do you both still work

41:28.285 --> 41:30.605
with other jobs?

41:30.645 --> 41:32.125
-No.

41:32.165 --> 41:33.525
'Cause you're going to

41:32.165 --> 41:33.525
keep running the van,

41:32.165 --> 41:33.525
aren't you?

41:33.565 --> 41:35.605
Yeah, we would

41:33.565 --> 41:35.605
like to keep it.

41:35.645 --> 41:38.285
I think that for us to just

41:35.645 --> 41:38.285
cut all of that off,

41:38.325 --> 41:40.205
you know,

41:38.325 --> 41:40.205
would be silly of us.

41:41.405 --> 41:43.525
[Scott]<i> A few curve balls.</i>

41:43.565 --> 41:47.165
Finding out that they're still

41:43.565 --> 41:47.165
going to be running the van

41:43.565 --> 41:47.165
and opening a new restaurant.

41:47.205 --> 41:51.325
If you're taking an investment

41:47.205 --> 41:51.325
from someone, to still

41:47.205 --> 41:51.325
be running your other business,

41:51.365 --> 41:54.725
what do you prioritize?

41:51.365 --> 41:54.725
How do you split your time?

41:56.765 --> 41:58.085
[Fred]<i> At the end</i>

41:56.765 --> 41:58.085
<i>of the meetings,</i>

41:58.125 --> 42:00.645
<i>the investors can spell out</i>

41:58.125 --> 42:00.645
<i>the offer they'll make</i>

42:00.685 --> 42:04.645
<i>if, and only if,</i>

42:00.685 --> 42:04.645
<i>they decide to invest.</i>

42:04.685 --> 42:06.285
[Charlie]

42:04.685 --> 42:06.285
Putting my cards on the table,

42:04.685 --> 42:06.285
I am interested

42:06.325 --> 42:09.885
to be involved potentially

42:06.325 --> 42:09.885
to offer £350,000.

42:09.925 --> 42:14.845
I think the biggest, uh,

42:09.925 --> 42:14.845
challenge for me is

42:09.925 --> 42:14.845
inconsistency in the food.

42:14.885 --> 42:18.205
For example, an issue we had

42:14.885 --> 42:18.205
last night was the cauliflower

42:18.245 --> 42:22.005
which came out dark and crispy,

42:22.045 --> 42:24.885
and then the second time

42:22.045 --> 42:24.885
it was kind of beige.

42:24.925 --> 42:27.245
No, and I completely agree.

42:27.285 --> 42:29.525
Like, it drives me crazy

42:27.285 --> 42:29.525
when things aren't consistent.

42:32.245 --> 42:34.165
And is that something you think

42:32.245 --> 42:34.165
you can deliver, Sinead?

42:35.365 --> 42:36.605
Yeah, definitely.

42:39.325 --> 42:41.525
[Charlie]

42:39.325 --> 42:41.525
<i>Lunch service today</i>

42:39.325 --> 42:41.525
<i>is absolutely vital.</i>

42:41.565 --> 42:44.405
You know, I spent 20 years

42:41.565 --> 42:44.405
getting to where I am now,

42:44.445 --> 42:46.805
and I don't want

42:44.445 --> 42:46.805
to throw it all away

42:44.445 --> 42:46.805
on a Filipino food concept.

42:46.845 --> 42:49.045
<i>I need to be</i>

42:46.845 --> 42:49.045
<i>absolutely convinced</i>

42:49.085 --> 42:52.405
<i>that these guys are going</i>

42:49.085 --> 42:52.405
<i>to deliver at all times.</i>

42:56.485 --> 42:58.285
I mean, it's 350 grand.

42:58.325 --> 43:00.765
I've opened restaurants

42:58.325 --> 43:00.765
for a lot more than that,

43:00.805 --> 43:03.965
so that figure is not out

43:00.805 --> 43:03.965
of the realm of possibility.

43:04.005 --> 43:07.565
[Scott]<i> I've got to give a lot</i>

43:04.005 --> 43:07.565
<i>of thought to how much time</i>

43:04.005 --> 43:07.565
<i>they'd need from me.</i>

43:07.605 --> 43:09.805
Thank you very much,

43:07.605 --> 43:09.805
see you in a bit.

43:07.605 --> 43:09.805
Thank you, Scott.

43:09.845 --> 43:12.125
It's still completely up

43:09.845 --> 43:12.125
in the air.

43:12.165 --> 43:17.645
Lee and Sinead

43:12.165 --> 43:17.645
are asking for £350,000

43:12.165 --> 43:17.645
to open their first restaurant.

43:17.685 --> 43:20.405
But Maurice Abboudi

43:17.685 --> 43:20.405
has a different idea.

43:20.445 --> 43:22.085
If I was to come back

43:20.445 --> 43:22.085
and make an offer,

43:22.125 --> 43:24.685
it would be for

43:22.125 --> 43:24.685
a takeaway business,

43:24.725 --> 43:27.125
it would not be

43:24.725 --> 43:27.125
for the restaurant.

43:27.165 --> 43:30.165
I would be looking at

43:27.165 --> 43:30.165
an investment of £150,000

43:30.205 --> 43:32.965
to get the first site

43:30.205 --> 43:32.965
up and running.

43:33.005 --> 43:36.165
I think we feel the restaurant

43:33.005 --> 43:36.165
is the way forward.

43:38.805 --> 43:43.045
I've been involved in a couple

43:38.805 --> 43:43.045
of businesses that have become

43:38.805 --> 43:43.045
huge successes on a takeaway.

43:46.285 --> 43:49.285
There's the opportunity there

43:46.285 --> 43:49.285
for you guys to make some money

43:49.325 --> 43:51.045
-'cause ultimately

43:49.325 --> 43:51.045
that's what it's about.

43:49.325 --> 43:51.045
-Yeah.

43:53.045 --> 43:55.565
I think their heart's

43:53.045 --> 43:55.565
in a restaurant.

43:55.605 --> 43:57.205
Takeaway could be

43:55.605 --> 43:57.205
more successful.

43:57.245 --> 44:01.325
You're selling

43:57.245 --> 44:01.325
a lot more £8 meals

43:57.245 --> 44:01.325
than you are £30 meals.

44:03.045 --> 44:06.765
Obviously, with our background,

44:03.045 --> 44:06.765
the takeaway would

44:03.045 --> 44:06.765
make more sense.

44:06.805 --> 44:09.245
We've got to keep

44:06.805 --> 44:09.245
all of our options open.

44:10.245 --> 44:11.405
Great, thank you very much.

44:11.445 --> 44:12.845
Thank you so much.

44:11.445 --> 44:12.845
Thank you for your time.

44:12.885 --> 44:15.085
-Thank you.

44:12.885 --> 44:15.085
-Bye-bye.

44:15.125 --> 44:16.565
[Lee]<i> If being a takeaway's</i>

44:15.125 --> 44:16.565
<i>the only option,</i>

44:16.605 --> 44:19.205
<i>I definitely think we could</i>

44:16.605 --> 44:19.205
<i>work with Maurice.</i>

44:19.245 --> 44:21.725
But, you know, like

44:19.245 --> 44:21.725
we've already found

44:19.245 --> 44:21.725
already in this process,

44:21.765 --> 44:24.885
you kind of have an idea

44:21.765 --> 44:24.885
of how you think it might

44:21.765 --> 44:24.885
turn out, and it doesn't.

44:28.565 --> 44:30.125
How are we doing

44:28.565 --> 44:30.125
with the list,

44:28.565 --> 44:30.125
are we good?

44:30.165 --> 44:31.805
-We just need your adobo.

44:30.165 --> 44:31.805
-All right, cool.

44:31.845 --> 44:33.325
-So, we need to cook an adobo?

44:31.845 --> 44:33.325
-Yes.

44:33.365 --> 44:34.965
[Fred]

44:33.365 --> 44:34.965
<i>It's an hour until lunch.</i>

44:35.005 --> 44:38.245
<i>After four years of hard work</i>

44:35.005 --> 44:38.245
<i>on their street food stall,</i>

44:38.285 --> 44:42.725
<i>this service could take</i>

44:38.285 --> 44:42.725
<i>Lee and Sinead's business</i>

44:38.285 --> 44:42.725
<i>to the next level.</i>

44:42.765 --> 44:45.245
[Lee]<i> We want</i>

44:42.765 --> 44:45.245
<i>to get BBQ Dreamz</i>

44:42.765 --> 44:45.245
<i>as a restaurant now.</i>

44:45.285 --> 44:48.565
It would be a shame for us

44:45.285 --> 44:48.565
to miss that.

44:48.605 --> 44:52.245
Um, yeah that would...

44:48.605 --> 44:52.245
That'd kind of be a bit of

44:48.605 --> 44:52.245
a kick in the nuts.

44:52.285 --> 44:55.285
Ten minutes

44:52.285 --> 44:55.285
till doors, people!

44:55.325 --> 44:59.685
We've got to show

44:55.325 --> 44:59.685
three investors we can

44:55.325 --> 44:59.685
take on board their criticism

44:59.725 --> 45:02.445
and kind of

44:59.725 --> 45:02.445
turn it around quickly.

45:02.485 --> 45:06.085
We've got £350,000 riding on

45:02.485 --> 45:06.085
this lunch service,

45:06.125 --> 45:08.885
so it's a lot of pressure.

45:08.925 --> 45:11.725
-I'd like to see

45:08.925 --> 45:11.725
a BBQ Dreamz in--

45:08.925 --> 45:11.725
-Newcastle.

45:11.765 --> 45:13.925
-Newcastle. In Dublin.

45:11.765 --> 45:13.925
-Yeah.

45:13.965 --> 45:15.445
Could you just

45:13.965 --> 45:15.445
watch the door?

45:15.485 --> 45:18.165
We want people to be sat

45:15.485 --> 45:18.165
in Liverpool going,

45:18.205 --> 45:20.245
"Oh, do you fancy

45:18.205 --> 45:20.245
a BBQ Dreamz tonight?"

45:20.285 --> 45:22.245
Yeah, I think

45:20.285 --> 45:22.245
that'd be wicked.

45:25.285 --> 45:27.005
[Lee] First customers!

45:27.045 --> 45:28.805
Welcome to BBQ Dreamz.

45:28.845 --> 45:30.805
What's the name

45:28.845 --> 45:30.805
on the booking?

45:30.845 --> 45:33.565
[Fred]

45:30.845 --> 45:33.565
<i>Customers will pay full price</i>

45:30.845 --> 45:33.565
<i>for today's lunch.</i>

45:33.605 --> 45:35.885
Do you just want tap water?

45:33.605 --> 45:35.885
Yeah.

45:35.925 --> 45:39.285
[Fred]<i> Just after opening,</i>

45:35.925 --> 45:39.285
<i>I thought I should</i>

45:35.925 --> 45:39.285
<i>take a look.</i>

45:39.325 --> 45:41.365
-Table for two?

45:39.325 --> 45:41.365
-Yes, please.

45:41.405 --> 45:44.445
Pork belly, and a cauliflower.

45:44.485 --> 45:47.045
-And we need another

45:44.485 --> 45:47.045
rice as well. Yeah.

45:44.485 --> 45:47.045
-[woman] One more rice, sweet.

45:47.085 --> 45:49.485
I'd say about two or three

45:47.085 --> 45:49.485
of the larger dishes,

45:49.525 --> 45:52.245
a couple of the top and then

45:49.525 --> 45:52.245
at least one from the bottom,

45:49.525 --> 45:52.245
all right?

45:52.285 --> 45:54.445
What can I get you? Yep.

45:54.485 --> 45:56.165
A green bean salad, ladies.

45:56.965 --> 45:58.925
No aioli.

45:58.965 --> 46:02.565
When I came in just now

45:58.965 --> 46:02.565
I felt like the energy levels

45:58.965 --> 46:02.565
were a bit low.

46:02.605 --> 46:04.085
You know,

46:02.605 --> 46:04.085
and the focus wasn't there.

46:04.125 --> 46:05.685
Have I just lost a ticket?

46:06.885 --> 46:08.485
Do you want any rice as well?

46:08.525 --> 46:09.565
Rice?

46:09.605 --> 46:11.325
Lee, very quickly.

46:09.605 --> 46:11.325
I know you are busy.

46:11.365 --> 46:13.485
Come with me,

46:11.365 --> 46:13.485
please come with me.

46:13.525 --> 46:16.765
Can everybody come a second?

46:13.525 --> 46:16.765
Come here, all of you,

46:13.525 --> 46:16.765
one second.

46:16.805 --> 46:21.245
Guys, I just cannot explain

46:16.805 --> 46:21.245
to you how important

46:16.805 --> 46:21.245
this lunch is

46:21.285 --> 46:23.165
and how much is riding on it.

46:23.205 --> 46:25.685
I want to see smiles

46:23.205 --> 46:25.685
from everybody here.

46:25.725 --> 46:30.005
It's your job

46:25.725 --> 46:30.005
to be charming first,

46:25.725 --> 46:30.005
not the other way around, okay?

46:30.045 --> 46:31.885
-Come on, please, come on.

46:30.045 --> 46:31.885
-Yeah, let's do this.

46:31.925 --> 46:35.205
-These guys need it, come on.

46:31.925 --> 46:35.205
-Smiles, smiles, smiles.

46:31.925 --> 46:35.205
Let's do this, guys.

46:37.605 --> 46:40.565
Just checking everything

46:37.605 --> 46:40.565
is okay here. Can I get you

46:37.605 --> 46:40.565
some more water maybe?

46:40.605 --> 46:42.845
The cauliflower is so good.

46:42.885 --> 46:44.405
Lovely. I'll take this,

46:42.885 --> 46:44.405
get you a fresh one.

46:47.485 --> 46:49.645

<i>a chance to talk</i>

46:52.165 --> 46:55.645
<i>to customers.</i>

46:55.685 --> 46:59.765
I want to try it again now,

46:55.685 --> 46:59.765
see what the service is like.

46:59.805 --> 47:01.685
-Nice to see you again.

46:59.805 --> 47:01.685
-How are you? Good?

47:01.725 --> 47:03.885
[Maurice]

<i>reactions are like.</i>

47:03.925 --> 47:06.125

47:03.925 --> 47:06.125
We are going to have you

47:03.925 --> 47:06.125
on this side, if that is okay.

47:06.165 --> 47:09.725
[Maurice]<i> The most fundamental</i>

47:06.165 --> 47:09.725
<i>thing of all is, do we</i>

47:09.765 --> 47:11.405
How are you guys

47:11.445 --> 47:13.845
-Fantastic.

47:11.445 --> 47:13.845
-The duck hearts

47:11.445 --> 47:13.845
are beautiful.

47:13.885 --> 47:15.725
Oh. They are, aren't they?

47:13.885 --> 47:15.725
Have you had them?

47:15.765 --> 47:17.365
-I have tried them.

47:15.765 --> 47:17.365
-They're great, aren't they?

47:19.085 --> 47:21.765
[Scott]<i> Last night</i>

47:24.045 --> 47:25.845
<i>Completely different dynamic.</i>

-I'm starving.

47:37.885 --> 47:39.645

47:39.685 --> 47:43.965
There were some

47:44.005 --> 47:47.005

[Claire]

47:47.045 --> 47:48.245
What can I get you?

47:48.285 --> 47:50.085
The pork belly, please.

47:50.125 --> 47:51.365
And the cauliflower.

47:51.405 --> 47:52.605
The cauliflower's amazing.

47:52.645 --> 47:54.685
I'll get the cauliflower.

47:54.725 --> 47:57.485
-Can I have the cauliflower?

47:54.725 --> 47:57.485
-Yep.

47:57.525 --> 47:59.565
Now I need

47:57.525 --> 47:59.565
another cauliflower, Joe.

48:01.085 --> 48:02.405
[Fred] Quelle surprise!

48:02.445 --> 48:05.405
<i>The investors have ordered</i>

48:02.445 --> 48:05.405
<i>the same dishes.</i>

48:05.445 --> 48:07.565
-Yep.

<i>If they're going to back</i>

48:14.525 --> 48:16.405
<i>the cauliflower last night,</i>

48:16.445 --> 48:18.885

48:16.445 --> 48:18.885
to see whether they get

48:16.445 --> 48:18.885
that right this time.

48:18.925 --> 48:20.525
-Okay, food's ready, yep?

48:18.925 --> 48:20.525
-Yeah.

48:20.565 --> 48:23.125
Here we go, so we have

48:20.565 --> 48:23.125
the adobo-glazed cauliflower

48:23.165 --> 48:25.005
-with the lime aioli.

48:23.165 --> 48:25.005
-Thank you.

48:27.565 --> 48:30.165
The cauliflower that's

48:27.565 --> 48:30.165
just come out now

48:27.565 --> 48:30.165
was correct

48:30.965 --> 48:33.085
and incredibly delicious.

48:33.885 --> 48:36.565
This is going out to Scott.

48:36.605 --> 48:39.085
So, this is their

48:36.605 --> 48:39.085
signature dish, lechon kawali.

48:40.005 --> 48:41.365
Go for it,

48:40.005 --> 48:41.365
I'd use your fingers.

48:42.445 --> 48:45.085
It looks like Scott

48:42.445 --> 48:45.085
is sharing his food.

48:45.125 --> 48:46.565
It's nice and succulent.

48:46.605 --> 48:48.205
Yeah, well, that'll be

48:46.605 --> 48:48.205
in the sous vide.

48:48.245 --> 48:50.925
But last night,

48:48.245 --> 48:50.925
I think when they were

48:48.245 --> 48:50.925
rushing things through,

48:50.965 --> 48:52.525
they didn't deep fry it

48:50.965 --> 48:52.525
long enough.

48:52.565 --> 48:54.485
So, there was a bit more fat

48:52.565 --> 48:54.485
that hadn't quite

48:52.565 --> 48:54.485
rendered down,

48:54.525 --> 48:57.205
but that's much crispier.

48:57.245 --> 49:00.485
[Fred]<i> The investors</i>

49:03.045 --> 49:04.885
Have you ever had

49:03.045 --> 49:04.885
Filipino food before?

49:04.925 --> 49:07.525
No, I usually go

49:04.925 --> 49:07.525
for Thai food.

49:04.925 --> 49:07.525
I love Thai food.

49:07.565 --> 49:10.325
It'll be really interesting

49:07.565 --> 49:10.325
to hear what you think.

49:07.565 --> 49:10.325
It's actually very different.

49:10.365 --> 49:12.005
Have you ever tried it,

49:10.365 --> 49:12.005
have you...

49:12.045 --> 49:13.365
I've not, no it's--

49:13.405 --> 49:15.645
Generally, do you like

49:13.405 --> 49:15.645
trying new stuff out?

49:15.685 --> 49:17.005
I'm well willing to try.

49:17.045 --> 49:19.365
Oh, well, excellent,

49:17.045 --> 49:19.365
good. Good.

49:20.685 --> 49:23.005
The beef I could probably

49:20.685 --> 49:23.005
eat all day, it's fantastic.

49:23.045 --> 49:24.965
The best pork ever.

49:25.005 --> 49:28.165
I would like to see this

49:25.005 --> 49:28.165
as an actual restaurant,

49:28.205 --> 49:31.805
even as... From Deliveroo,

49:28.205 --> 49:31.805
takeaway stuff.

49:31.845 --> 49:33.485
Very, very good, yeah.

49:33.525 --> 49:35.725
Charlie's got two pots

49:33.525 --> 49:35.725
of herbs to speak to.

49:35.765 --> 49:37.525
[all laughing]

49:37.565 --> 49:38.805
And even those herbs

49:37.565 --> 49:38.805
are wilting.

49:38.845 --> 49:39.965
[all laughing]

49:45.525 --> 49:47.725
Charlie? How's it going?

49:47.765 --> 49:50.885
Good. Everyone I've spoken to

49:47.765 --> 49:50.885
all really feel that

49:50.925 --> 49:52.645
it's something genuinely

49:50.925 --> 49:52.645
original and new.

49:52.685 --> 49:54.605
I can't help to think

49:52.685 --> 49:54.605
there's going to be a but.

49:54.645 --> 49:55.925
Is there a but here?

49:55.965 --> 49:57.845
There's an enormous but.

49:57.885 --> 50:00.205
We're going into a business

49:57.885 --> 50:00.205
where thousands of start-ups

49:57.885 --> 50:00.205
go bust every year.

50:00.245 --> 50:01.725
There is an

50:00.245 --> 50:01.725
enormous risk here,

50:01.765 --> 50:04.245
but the most

50:01.765 --> 50:04.245
important thing is,

50:04.285 --> 50:08.685
at the core of this business,

50:04.285 --> 50:08.685
we've got two very committed

50:04.285 --> 50:08.685
and brilliant people.

50:08.725 --> 50:12.245
And we've got some dishes

50:08.725 --> 50:12.245
that are as good as

50:08.725 --> 50:12.245
I've ever eaten anywhere.

50:12.285 --> 50:15.445
Well, Charlie, if you're

50:12.285 --> 50:15.445
really interested I'm going

50:12.285 --> 50:15.445
to give you a deadline.

50:15.485 --> 50:17.605
You've got to come back

50:15.485 --> 50:17.605
here tonight by 7:00 p.m.

50:17.645 --> 50:20.765
If you're that means

50:17.645 --> 50:20.765
you're in, if you're not,

50:17.645 --> 50:20.765
we know you're out.

50:20.805 --> 50:23.845
Okay, well, I've got a lot

50:20.805 --> 50:23.845
of thinking to do between

50:20.805 --> 50:23.845
now and seven o'clock.

50:23.885 --> 50:25.205
Good luck.

50:27.645 --> 50:29.285
-Two rice.

50:27.645 --> 50:29.285
-[woman] Two rice.

50:29.805 --> 50:31.325
And cauliflower.

50:31.365 --> 50:32.885
Sweet.

50:32.925 --> 50:35.285
Thank you,

50:32.925 --> 50:35.285
thanks for coming.

50:36.605 --> 50:38.605
[Scott]<i> What they've done</i>

50:36.605 --> 50:38.605
<i>in two shifts is great.</i>

50:38.645 --> 50:42.165
But what's become apparent

50:38.645 --> 50:42.165
after my chat with them

50:42.205 --> 50:45.165
this morning and seeing them

50:42.205 --> 50:45.165
in action here,

50:45.205 --> 50:47.525
they probably need expertise

50:47.565 --> 50:50.005
<i>as well as</i>

50:47.565 --> 50:50.005
<i>some financial input.</i>

50:50.045 --> 50:53.165
Which takes up

50:50.045 --> 50:53.165
quite a bit more time.

50:53.205 --> 50:55.885
I'm going to need

50:53.205 --> 50:55.885
to mull it over

50:55.925 --> 50:57.285
and make a decision shortly.

50:57.325 --> 50:59.125
-It was good seeing you.

50:57.325 --> 50:59.125
-Great lunch.

50:59.165 --> 51:00.565
-Thank you very much.

50:59.165 --> 51:00.565
-Good luck this afternoon.

51:00.605 --> 51:02.445
[Lee] Yeah, thank you.

51:00.605 --> 51:02.445
See you soon.

51:06.285 --> 51:08.165

51:08.205 --> 51:11.925
So many things can go wrong.

51:08.205 --> 51:11.925
Among other things,

51:08.205 --> 51:11.925
customers might not like it,

51:11.965 --> 51:14.125
so it's a huge risk.

51:14.165 --> 51:16.445
There's a large distance

and my hand

51:16.485 --> 51:18.165
being in my pocket.

How are you, Maurice?

51:21.525 --> 51:23.125
-Very good.

51:23.165 --> 51:25.645
So, tell me, do you have

51:23.165 --> 51:25.645
a specific vision

51:23.165 --> 51:25.645
for this place?

51:25.685 --> 51:28.325
Yeah, my vision

51:25.685 --> 51:28.325
is really for a takeaway.

51:28.365 --> 51:31.045
Your labor costs

51:28.365 --> 51:31.045
are a lot lower,

51:31.085 --> 51:34.805
the capital expenditure

51:31.085 --> 51:34.805
is a lot less than when

51:31.085 --> 51:34.805
you open up a restaurant.

51:34.845 --> 51:36.285
Well, you've got

51:34.845 --> 51:36.285
a lot to think about.

51:36.325 --> 51:38.005
A lot to think about.

51:38.045 --> 51:39.205
I'm going to give you

51:38.045 --> 51:39.205
a deadline and you've

51:38.045 --> 51:39.205
got to come back here

51:39.245 --> 51:41.205
tonight at seven o'clock.

51:41.245 --> 51:42.565
-Fair enough.

[Sinead] The last dish.

51:47.885 --> 51:49.605
[Joe] It's only right

51:47.885 --> 51:49.605
it was cauliflower.

51:50.685 --> 51:52.165
-[Maurice]

51:50.685 --> 51:52.165
It was really good.

51:50.685 --> 51:52.165
-Good.

51:52.205 --> 51:53.845

51:53.885 --> 51:55.205
-Well done.

51:55.245 --> 51:56.845
Thank you,

51:55.245 --> 51:56.845
thanks very much.

52:02.045 --> 52:04.605
[Sinead]

52:02.045 --> 52:04.605
I feel relieved about that.

52:04.645 --> 52:07.525
-You don't seem so sure.

52:04.645 --> 52:07.525
There's like a but--

52:04.645 --> 52:07.525
-I'm just...

52:07.565 --> 52:10.005
-No, I'm just

52:07.565 --> 52:10.005
honestly exhausted.

52:07.565 --> 52:10.005
-Yeah.

52:10.045 --> 52:12.965
I'm just, like, I've been

52:10.045 --> 52:12.965
so full of stress and tension

52:13.005 --> 52:15.205
that now it's like

52:13.005 --> 52:15.205
the service is done

52:15.245 --> 52:16.925
and now we just have to wait.

52:16.965 --> 52:20.805
The relief is that

52:16.965 --> 52:20.805
we've done everything

52:16.965 --> 52:20.805
that we can, you know,

52:20.845 --> 52:22.485
and I think that

52:20.845 --> 52:22.485
we did it really well.

52:22.525 --> 52:24.525
I think that we're relieved

52:22.525 --> 52:24.525
that we haven't

52:22.525 --> 52:24.525
let ourselves down.

the clock goes 7:00,

52:46.005 --> 52:50.165
it's game on.

52:50.205 --> 52:52.325
If not, I'm afraid

52:50.205 --> 52:52.325
it's game over.

52:52.365 --> 52:54.125

53:51.765 --> 53:56.125
not to say anything about

53:51.765 --> 53:56.125
what you want to offer them?

53:56.165 --> 53:59.365
-Okay.

53:56.165 --> 53:59.365
-Because we have

53:56.165 --> 53:59.365
a deadline until seven o'clock.

53:59.405 --> 54:01.245
Ah, okay.

54:01.285 --> 54:03.685

54:01.285 --> 54:03.685
that Charlie and Scott have

54:01.285 --> 54:03.685
the time to come back.

54:08.685 --> 54:10.805

54:27.845 --> 54:30.085
-How are you?

54:30.125 --> 54:31.805
I thought that I had it

54:30.125 --> 54:31.805
all to myself, Charlie.

54:31.845 --> 54:33.485
Oh, well, you know.

54:33.525 --> 54:36.005
Charlie, before you start,

54:36.045 --> 54:37.965
two minutes to turn up.

54:56.685 --> 54:59.285
Very good result.

54:59.325 --> 55:03.525
I'd love to help them out.

54:59.325 --> 55:03.525
But they are going to need

54:59.325 --> 55:03.525
a lot more than just money.

55:04.765 --> 55:06.765
<i>I think there's a couple</i>

55:04.765 --> 55:06.765
<i>of the other investors</i>

55:06.805 --> 55:09.245
who could probably plug

55:06.805 --> 55:09.245
that gap a lot better than me.

55:09.285 --> 55:11.925
So begrudgingly,

55:09.285 --> 55:11.925
I'm not going to invest.

55:13.765 --> 55:16.325
Let's cut to the chase,

55:13.765 --> 55:16.325
we are here to talk business.

55:16.365 --> 55:18.805
Maurice you are keenest.

55:16.365 --> 55:18.805
You arrived first.

55:18.845 --> 55:20.605
[all laughing]

55:20.645 --> 55:24.845
So, I think it's fair

55:20.645 --> 55:24.845
we hear your offer

55:20.645 --> 55:24.845
and your vision for BBQ Dreamz.

55:24.885 --> 55:29.205
I would like to offer you

55:24.885 --> 55:29.205
£150,000

55:29.245 --> 55:32.125
to open up a takeaway unit.

55:32.165 --> 55:34.925
I've been fortunate

55:32.165 --> 55:34.925
enough that I've had

55:34.965 --> 55:37.525
four businesses

55:34.965 --> 55:37.525
where I have expanded.

55:37.565 --> 55:40.165
That includes Domino's Pizza.

55:40.205 --> 55:43.925
I think with your hard work,

55:40.205 --> 55:43.925
your commitment,

55:40.205 --> 55:43.925
the product that you have,

55:43.965 --> 55:47.525
we can open up multiple sites

55:43.965 --> 55:47.525
in the next few years.

55:47.565 --> 55:48.965
-That's where I am.

55:47.565 --> 55:48.965
-Thank you, cheers.

55:49.005 --> 55:49.925
Thank you.

55:49.965 --> 55:51.245
Charlie.

55:51.285 --> 55:54.365
I think it's a menu that

55:51.285 --> 55:54.365
actually needs a restaurant.

55:54.405 --> 55:58.245
I've developed and sold

55:54.405 --> 55:58.245
five businesses successfully.

55:58.285 --> 56:00.645
Most recently,

55:58.285 --> 56:00.645
a group of 16 pubs.

56:00.685 --> 56:04.125
As a result,

56:00.685 --> 56:04.125
I'm happy to offer

56:04.165 --> 56:06.965
the amount you've asked for

56:04.165 --> 56:06.965
which is £350,000

56:07.005 --> 56:10.085
to invest in one site.

56:10.125 --> 56:13.005
If that site is successful,

56:10.125 --> 56:13.005
why not do 200?

56:14.445 --> 56:18.085
So that's it, £350,000,

56:14.445 --> 56:18.085
a restaurant,

56:18.125 --> 56:19.765
and me hanging around

56:18.125 --> 56:19.765
being a pain in the neck.

56:19.805 --> 56:21.325
[both chuckling]

56:21.365 --> 56:23.805
[all laughing]

56:23.845 --> 56:25.405
[Fred]

56:23.845 --> 56:25.405
Two very different offers.

56:25.445 --> 56:28.325
I think you maybe

56:25.445 --> 56:28.325
need to take a moment and--

56:28.365 --> 56:29.525
If we could, yeah.

56:29.565 --> 56:32.005
Talk and discuss

56:29.565 --> 56:32.005
what you want to do.

56:32.045 --> 56:33.285
-We'll wait for you.

56:32.045 --> 56:33.285
-Thanks.

56:36.125 --> 56:38.125
-[Lee] Oh.

56:36.125 --> 56:38.125
-I wasn't expecting that.

56:38.165 --> 56:39.805
I wasn't expecting that.

56:40.485 --> 56:42.245
[Lee] My gut instinct,

56:42.285 --> 56:44.165
I'm pulling more

56:42.285 --> 56:44.165
towards Charlie.

56:44.205 --> 56:46.645
I could also see,

56:44.205 --> 56:46.645
like, Maurice, like,

56:46.685 --> 56:48.045
I valued his opinion.

56:48.085 --> 56:50.725
I thought that he was...

56:48.085 --> 56:50.725
I really liked him.

56:50.765 --> 56:54.325
[Sinead] And it's, like,

56:50.765 --> 56:54.325
taking his advice because

56:50.765 --> 56:54.325
he's built something huge.

56:54.365 --> 56:56.685
-Huge, right?

56:54.365 --> 56:56.685
-Yeah.

56:56.725 --> 56:59.245
-We eat Domino's

56:56.725 --> 56:59.245
all the time.

56:56.725 --> 56:59.245
-All the time.

56:59.285 --> 57:00.605
[Lee and Sinead laughing]

57:01.485 --> 57:03.005
I love you so much.

57:12.045 --> 57:13.525
So, what's your decision?

57:13.565 --> 57:15.205
As hard as this is,

57:15.245 --> 57:18.245
we think that for us,

57:15.245 --> 57:18.245
we would like to go

57:15.245 --> 57:18.245
with Charlie's offer.

57:18.285 --> 57:19.645
-Oh.

57:18.285 --> 57:19.645
-Absolutely.

57:19.685 --> 57:21.445
-Thank you.

57:19.685 --> 57:21.445
-Congratulations.

57:21.485 --> 57:22.885
-Thank you both.

57:21.485 --> 57:22.885
-Thank you.

57:22.925 --> 57:24.525
Thank you for choosing me.

57:25.845 --> 57:27.245
Thank you for choosing us.

57:27.285 --> 57:28.925
I really hope it works out.

57:28.965 --> 57:30.685
All the best.

57:28.965 --> 57:30.685
Charlie, good luck.

57:30.725 --> 57:32.805
-[Charlie] Cheers, Maurice.

57:30.725 --> 57:32.805
-Thank you. Bye-bye.

57:32.845 --> 57:36.165
I'm a little bit disappointed

57:32.845 --> 57:36.165
that I didn't win that.

57:36.205 --> 57:40.325
But I think in their

57:36.205 --> 57:40.325
heart of hearts, what they want

57:36.205 --> 57:40.325
to do is open up a restaurant.

57:40.365 --> 57:44.605
I wish I had the opportunity

57:40.365 --> 57:44.605
to take this forward

57:40.365 --> 57:44.605
as a takeaway business.

57:44.645 --> 57:48.165
Who knows?

57:44.645 --> 57:48.165
There may be an offshoot.

57:44.645 --> 57:48.165
It doesn't end here.

57:48.205 --> 57:50.485
-Cheers. To you guys.

57:48.205 --> 57:50.485
-Cheers. Well done.

57:50.525 --> 57:52.125
-Thank you so much.

57:50.525 --> 57:52.125
-[Sinead] Cheers.

57:52.165 --> 57:54.405
[Fred] Well done, Charlie.

57:52.165 --> 57:54.405
Congratulations.

57:54.445 --> 57:57.805
In a business investment,

57:54.445 --> 57:57.805
you need a lot more

57:54.445 --> 57:57.805
than a good idea.

57:57.845 --> 58:01.485
At the very least

57:57.845 --> 58:01.485
you need a good idea,

57:57.845 --> 58:01.485
a great team

58:01.525 --> 58:05.125
and, in this case, we've got

58:01.525 --> 58:05.125
what we already know

58:01.525 --> 58:05.125
is a sensational product.

58:05.165 --> 58:09.205
So, to put money behind that

58:05.165 --> 58:09.205
doesn't feel like

58:05.165 --> 58:09.205
that great a risk.

58:09.245 --> 58:10.685
-Tastes good, doesn't it?

58:09.245 --> 58:10.685
-Really good.

58:10.725 --> 58:12.285
[all laughing]

58:12.325 --> 58:15.685
-What, the investment,

58:12.325 --> 58:15.685
or the champagne?

58:12.325 --> 58:15.685
-The whole thing.

58:15.725 --> 58:17.845
-We're in shock, I think.

58:15.725 --> 58:17.845
-We are in shock, yeah.

58:17.885 --> 58:20.685
I think, like, in a couple of

58:17.885 --> 58:20.685
days' time we'll probably have

58:17.885 --> 58:20.685
a breakdown and start crying

58:20.725 --> 58:22.605
and start laughing deliriously.

58:22.645 --> 58:25.205
Thank you so much.

58:22.645 --> 58:25.205
See you soon.

58:25.245 --> 58:27.365
-Look forward to getting

58:25.245 --> 58:27.365
to know you better.

58:25.245 --> 58:27.365
-[Lee] Thank you.

58:27.405 --> 58:29.645
And to opening up

58:27.405 --> 58:29.645
a superb restaurant.

58:29.685 --> 58:32.005
-It's crazy.

58:32.045 --> 58:35.125
Honestly, I don't think

58:32.045 --> 58:35.125
we can take it all in

58:32.045 --> 58:35.125
right now.

58:35.165 --> 58:37.365
£350,000!

58:37.405 --> 58:40.045
I'm so pleased

58:37.405 --> 58:40.045
for Lee and Sinead,

58:37.405 --> 58:40.045
they are such lovely people.

58:40.085 --> 58:42.925
Dedicated, passionate

58:40.085 --> 58:42.925
and hardworking.

58:42.965 --> 58:45.485
If anyone tells you

58:42.965 --> 58:45.485
that hard work doesn't pay,

58:45.525 --> 58:48.805
remind them of Lee and Sinead.

58:45.525 --> 58:48.805
Remind them of BBQ Dreamz.

58:54.965 --> 58:56.445
We're making

58:54.965 --> 58:56.445
our Bhangra burgers.

58:58.245 --> 59:00.445
That sauce on the side,

58:58.245 --> 59:00.445
it's really hot.

59:00.485 --> 59:02.005
[exhales] My God!

59:03.405 --> 59:05.125
What do you think

59:03.405 --> 59:05.125
about the food, guys?

59:05.165 --> 59:06.845
[Chris] That's a really

59:05.165 --> 59:06.845
ugly plate of food.

59:06.885 --> 59:10.845
If we invested in you,

59:06.885 --> 59:10.845
how do you think we would

59:06.885 --> 59:10.845
get that money back?
