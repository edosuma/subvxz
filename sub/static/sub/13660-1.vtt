00:02.000 --> 00:04.680
[poker chips clink]

00:04.720 --> 00:06.960
[Daniel Negreanu] You can
tell if you lose this pot,

00:07.000 --> 00:09.160
you can tell the people
back home you got unlucky,

00:09.200 --> 00:11.480
otherwise you'd have won
this tournament for sure.

00:11.520 --> 00:13.520
[man laughs]

00:13.560 --> 00:14.960
- Ah!
- Okay.

00:16.760 --> 00:19.280
[Daniel] Oh, shoot, that's
a bad flop for you.

00:19.320 --> 00:22.600
Oh, boy. Now he needs
a queen, ace or a ten.

00:22.640 --> 00:24.880
Everything but.

00:24.920 --> 00:26.680
- [knocks]
- He's in.

00:26.720 --> 00:28.840
- Good cash, anyway, right?
- Yeah.

00:28.880 --> 00:31.800
Not everybody cashes in
the EPT Grand Final in Monaco.

00:31.840 --> 00:33.680
- That's right.
- And you just did.

00:36.920 --> 00:40.560
[Jason] <i> When you think of</i>
<i>poker, most people think</i>
<i>of Daniel Negreanu.</i>

00:40.600 --> 00:43.280
[Oren] <i> We knew that he was</i>
<i>always going to be a winner.</i>

00:43.320 --> 00:45.280
[Antonio] <i> There was just</i>
<i>something about him.</i>

00:45.320 --> 00:48.080
[Phil Ivey] <i> When I met</i>
<i>Daniel he was already a legend.</i>

00:48.120 --> 00:51.440
<i>[Phil Hellmuth]
Six bracelets, two WPT titles.</i>

00:51.480 --> 00:55.000
[John] <i> His understanding</i>
<i>of the game is peerless.</i>

00:55.040 --> 00:57.560
[James]
<i>Daniel is clearly the best</i>

00:57.600 --> 00:59.600
<i>tournament poker player
in the world.</i>

00:59.640 --> 01:01.440
[Vanessa] <i> He's seen poker</i>

01:01.480 --> 01:03.240
<i>in all of its different
incarnations</i>

01:03.280 --> 01:05.360
<i>in the past 20 years and</i>

01:05.400 --> 01:08.360
<i>he's still talking up a storm
while doing it.</i>

01:08.400 --> 01:12.280
[Maria] <i> I can't even imagine</i>
<i>what kind of legacy he'll</i>
<i>have in the game.</i>

01:12.320 --> 01:14.040
[Doyle] <i> He crushes it.</i>

01:14.080 --> 01:16.640
[Mike] <i> My brother</i>
<i>wrote his own rules.</i>

01:16.680 --> 01:19.640
[Overlapping voices] <i> He went</i>
<i>through a phase where</i>
<i>his ego ran riot.</i>

01:19.680 --> 01:22.480
<i>Daniel made bad decisions. He
ended up having to start over.</i>

01:22.520 --> 01:25.000
<i>Daniel was super-driven,
very outspoken.</i>

01:25.040 --> 01:27.280
<i>Very opinionated. That's
what we love about him.</i>

01:27.320 --> 01:30.000
<i>- ..Universally loved.
- He's usually right.</i>

01:30.040 --> 01:32.760
<i>I can't think of too many
people who've done more for
the game of poker today.</i>

01:32.800 --> 01:35.640
<i>He's never turned anybody
down when they needed him.</i>

01:35.680 --> 01:38.640
<i>I think Daniel Negreanu
is the most notable,</i>

01:38.680 --> 01:42.480
<i>most recognised,
most famous poker player...</i>

01:43.920 --> 01:45.640
<i>..in the world.</i>

02:27.960 --> 02:30.160
This is where I started.

02:30.200 --> 02:31.880
It's been so long
since I've been here.

02:31.920 --> 02:34.080
[laughter]

02:34.120 --> 02:37.400
<i>To be honest with you, when
the whole thing came calling</i>

02:37.440 --> 02:42.040
<i>as I turned 40, it didn't
really sink in. I mean, I
expected it, I'm not gonna lie.</i>

02:42.080 --> 02:45.480
<i>Like, I figured that if
I wasn't inducted, what
exactly do I gotta do</i>

02:45.520 --> 02:46.960
<i>to get in this thing then?</i>

02:47.000 --> 02:48.880
<i>So it wasn't a shock.</i>

02:48.920 --> 02:51.520
<i>It didn't really sink in,
till I was up there</i>

02:51.560 --> 02:54.000
<i>and shared what I wanted
to share.</i>

02:54.040 --> 02:58.040
<i>And went through the journey in
my head of how it all started.</i>

03:07.600 --> 03:10.600
I was born in 1974
in Toronto, Canada.

03:13.080 --> 03:16.400
Both my parents
are from Romania.

03:16.440 --> 03:20.800
They came to Canada in
about 1967 with five dollars
in their pocket

03:20.840 --> 03:22.440
and really just
worked their way up.

03:24.520 --> 03:27.920
They started, like, doing
candy floss at the exhibition.

03:27.960 --> 03:31.960
But my dad was an electrician.
Started to work in
the electrical department.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.840
Then they started to buy
houses and rent them out,

03:35.880 --> 03:38.200
and speculate and
all that kind of stuff.

03:38.240 --> 03:42.240
They did a great job of creating
an upper middle-class life

03:42.280 --> 03:44.080
from essentially nothing.

03:45.960 --> 03:49.080
My dad knew very little English.
He knew, in Romanian,

03:49.120 --> 03:52.120
you say, "I'm gonna do
something," you say,
"Okay, fuck." Right?

03:52.160 --> 03:55.720
So he would have, like,
these moments where he'd
be working for someone,

03:55.760 --> 03:58.800
and the lady would say,
"Okay, I need you to do this."
And he'd say, "Okay, fuck."

03:58.840 --> 04:02.800
And he would keep saying...
Eventually, she's like,
"Why do you keep saying that?"

04:02.840 --> 04:06.840
And he's like... He didn't get
that was a bad word in English.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.440
[he laughs]
True story!

04:09.480 --> 04:12.000
He almost got in a big fight,
when the husband came home.

04:12.040 --> 04:14.480
"Why do you want
to fuck my wife?!"

04:18.200 --> 04:20.640
My childhood, I would
describe it as

04:20.680 --> 04:23.040
typical European-style
childhood.

04:23.080 --> 04:25.960
My mother, she cooked,
she cleaned, she was sweet.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.520
She fed everybody. You came
over to the house, you're like,
"I'm not hungry, I'm good."

04:29.560 --> 04:32.640
She'd put a plate of food
in front of you and
make you eat it.

04:32.680 --> 04:35.520
My dad was always filling your
cup, make sure you had a drink.

04:35.560 --> 04:37.920
Very hospitable, very loving.

04:37.960 --> 04:40.480
I would say more on
the liberal side. Open.

04:40.520 --> 04:44.240
You know, they talked about
whatever in front of me.

04:44.280 --> 04:46.720
We just had a perfect,
loving family.

04:47.960 --> 04:49.880
- Get that?
- Yeah.

04:49.920 --> 04:52.080
My parents were selfless.

04:52.120 --> 04:56.040
They both loved me and my
brother more than, you know,

04:56.080 --> 04:58.440
anyone could imagine and
they were great role models.

05:00.280 --> 05:03.040
My mum, just that generous,
selfless heart,

05:03.080 --> 05:05.560
of just giving.

05:05.600 --> 05:09.360
She'd been through a lot
in her life. She had nine
miscarriages.

05:09.400 --> 05:12.440
She had five boys, four girls.

05:12.480 --> 05:15.040
Finally, my brother and me.

05:15.080 --> 05:19.600
It's one of the reasons I think
that she was so smothering
and spoiling.

05:19.640 --> 05:21.840
Cos she just cherished us
so much more,

05:21.880 --> 05:24.680
because of all she suffered
to go through to just have us.

05:26.480 --> 05:29.080
And my dad was like
my best friend.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.600
We'd watch TV late.

05:31.640 --> 05:34.320
I'd pretend to fall asleep
so he'd carry me up to my bed.

05:34.360 --> 05:36.160
[Dad] Now it starts
to scratch, eh?

05:36.200 --> 05:39.000
He taught me how to be
hospitable and generous.

05:39.040 --> 05:41.120
My dad was just that guy.

05:41.160 --> 05:43.920
If we had a party and there was
somebody who wasn't having fun,

05:43.960 --> 05:46.000
my dad could sense it.
He would make a joke.

05:46.040 --> 05:48.320
Crack a joke with them,
liven up the mood.

05:48.360 --> 05:51.840
And I feel like I got a lot
of those traits from my father.

05:51.880 --> 05:54.760
I think of other people and the
rough childhoods they've had,

05:54.800 --> 05:57.840
and I was really blessed.

05:57.880 --> 06:01.640
Well, at school I was a bit
of a know-it-all and
a bit of a...

06:01.680 --> 06:05.360
When people would fight me,
I didn't care how big they
were, I would fight back.

06:07.840 --> 06:10.880
[Mike] Maybe some might
consider him a brat.

06:10.920 --> 06:14.200
A troublemaker.
I don't know if it was because

06:14.240 --> 06:16.080
he was always a smaller kid,

06:16.120 --> 06:19.640
so he had to prove
that, er, he was heard.

06:21.480 --> 06:23.880
My brother always knew
that I had his back.

06:23.920 --> 06:27.720
So he'd let his mouth
get him in trouble.

06:30.560 --> 06:33.240
[Daniel] When I was in
the first grade, Mike
was in the sixth grade.

06:33.280 --> 06:36.720
He was six foot tall already.
He was really a big kid.

06:36.760 --> 06:39.720
It's actually part of the reason
I have a big mouth.

06:39.760 --> 06:44.240
He's the big protector guy
and he would absolutely
take a bullet for me.

06:44.280 --> 06:47.080
There were numerous times
when I would have to like

06:47.120 --> 06:51.960
settle his battles for him
or just let people know that
Daniel has a bigger brother.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.920
[Daniel] I was a small guy.
I'd fight for myself but
having my brother as back-up

06:55.960 --> 06:58.320
certainly made it easier.

06:58.360 --> 07:01.400
The truth is, I was actually
really cocky.

07:01.440 --> 07:03.880
My teachers actually...
they shouldn't have liked me,

07:03.920 --> 07:06.080
but I think they did like me
and appreciate me.

07:06.120 --> 07:08.360
Often, I would come
to class with a pillow.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.640
[Mike] My brother
found class so boring.

07:12.680 --> 07:15.800
He stood up from his desk,
walked to the back of the class,

07:15.840 --> 07:18.560
laid on the floor
and went to sleep.

07:20.200 --> 07:22.360
And the teacher says,
"You can't do that."

07:22.400 --> 07:24.840
Well, he goes, "I'm tired.
This is boring."

07:26.120 --> 07:28.480
Structure for my brother wasn't

07:28.520 --> 07:30.600
on his priority list.

07:30.640 --> 07:32.840
He did things when
he wanted to do things.

07:32.880 --> 07:38.440
And...it was always difficult
for him to follow the rules.

07:38.480 --> 07:42.800
[Daniel] I was a tough kid.
There's a letter my mum
got me for my birthday

07:42.840 --> 07:45.400
a few years ago from when
I was ten years old.

07:45.440 --> 07:49.600
And it reads... This is,
like, five days into school,
cos it starts on September 6th.

07:49.640 --> 07:53.240
"Dear Mrs Negreanu, I am writing
as a follow up to my telephone
conversation

07:53.280 --> 07:56.040
with you Tuesday,
September 11, 1984.

07:56.080 --> 07:58.440
I want it clearly understood
that I will not tolerate

07:58.480 --> 08:00.960
Daniel's poor manners
or behaviour.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.960
In light of your own position
to always support and
excuse Daniel,

08:04.000 --> 08:06.440
I will have no option but
to remove him from school

08:06.480 --> 08:08.240
should he continue to ignore
the school rules."

08:08.280 --> 08:10.520
Ha! I love that one!

08:10.560 --> 08:12.880
It was so funny,
cos that's what she was.

08:12.920 --> 08:14.960
"It wasn't Daniel's fault,
couldn't be."

08:16.880 --> 08:19.120
[Mike] School wasn't
easy for him.

08:19.160 --> 08:21.600
We couldn't figure out why.

08:21.640 --> 08:26.000
We later found out that
he looked at things in
a different way.

08:26.040 --> 08:29.600
I think Daniel's
just misunderstood,

08:29.640 --> 08:32.440
because, instead of
thinking in the box,

08:32.480 --> 08:36.080
he was drawing his own lines
and his lines were a lot
bigger than that box.

08:36.120 --> 08:39.039
So they put him
in gifted math class,

08:39.080 --> 08:43.039
to accelerate
his desire to learn.

08:43.080 --> 08:47.600
[Daniel] I was always a numbers
geek and it was just very fun
for me to look at numbers.

08:49.400 --> 08:52.080
When I was a kid and I
used to play video games...

08:52.120 --> 08:55.560
I'd play a baseball game or
something, and I wrote
down the stats.

08:55.600 --> 08:58.200
I kept logs of it,
so I knew like, you know,

08:58.240 --> 09:02.720
three for 11 is 372 -
or 373, pardon me!

09:05.360 --> 09:10.520
[Mike] I total believe
that my brother was never
challenged enough in school.

09:10.560 --> 09:13.880
He found things to be
boring all the time.

09:13.920 --> 09:16.720
He always wanted to find out,
"What's next?"

09:16.760 --> 09:20.800
Sometimes I'd just sit there
with my mother going, "What
are we going to do with him?"

09:20.840 --> 09:23.520
He doesn't listen.
He does what he wants, but yet,

09:23.560 --> 09:26.640
everything he does
he excels and does well.

09:26.680 --> 09:30.040
How are you supposed to
discipline someone for
always doing well?

09:32.320 --> 09:35.040
[Daniel] By the time I was in
high school, I actually
did really well.

09:35.080 --> 09:37.720
But then I started to, you know,
go down the other path.

09:37.760 --> 09:41.400
I was going to the pool halls
with my friends Regev and Oren.

09:43.680 --> 09:47.400
Oren and Regev are essentially
like my brothers.

09:47.440 --> 09:52.160
We grew up in Toronto, you know,
becoming men and doing all
kinds of bad stuff.

09:52.200 --> 09:55.240
Trouble? Us? Never.
We were really nice.

09:55.280 --> 09:58.560
- [he laughs]
- We got in trouble.

09:58.600 --> 10:00.760
- I asked like that.
- [girl] Oh, my God!

10:00.800 --> 10:02.400
In about two seconds,
he did nothing.

10:02.440 --> 10:04.320
[girl] What did you do that for?

10:04.360 --> 10:05.880
I thought you wanted everything.

10:05.920 --> 10:08.120
[girl] No, his hair,
not his eyebrows!

10:08.160 --> 10:11.680
- Hey, man! Look at my eyebrow!
- It's cool.

10:11.720 --> 10:14.160
Daniel, you trust me so far.

10:15.320 --> 10:17.480
Oren and Regev?

10:17.520 --> 10:20.120
Brothers from another mother.

10:20.160 --> 10:23.640
[Oren] We were always like
the clowns of the class,
making everybody laugh.

10:23.680 --> 10:28.040
He was the entertainer
of the group, by far.

10:28.080 --> 10:30.520
[laughter]

10:30.560 --> 10:33.840
But tomorrow I'll be better.
Tomorrow, you'll look the same.

10:33.880 --> 10:35.720
[laughter]

10:35.760 --> 10:38.480
[Oren] You know, it was all
about just having fun.

10:38.520 --> 10:41.280
Not doing bad stuff,
but just doing funny stuff.

10:44.560 --> 10:48.840
We didn't really like school.
Unfortunately, the pool hall
was really close to school.

10:48.880 --> 10:54.720
So it made it really easy for
us, before we could even drive,
to make that trip.

10:54.760 --> 10:57.040
[Mike] It was a place
to hang out.

10:57.080 --> 10:59.280
After school or on
the weekends, evenings,

10:59.320 --> 11:01.600
they would just go congregate
and play billiards.

11:01.640 --> 11:03.840
And he got really good
at playing snooker.

11:03.880 --> 11:07.320
And he made some money
on that felt as well.

11:09.240 --> 11:11.600
[Daniel] We were gambling
for five bucks and drink

11:11.640 --> 11:15.200
and, you know, the table charge,
so it wasn't like big gambling,

11:15.240 --> 11:18.640
but it was where I was entered
into that world where I met

11:18.680 --> 11:21.360
some people who played poker and
I sort of got introduced to it.

11:23.800 --> 11:27.520
I thought it was all luck,
but then I noticed
the same guys keep winning

11:27.560 --> 11:30.560
and the same guys keep losing.
I was like, "Hm? Interesting."

11:30.600 --> 11:32.960
So I went to the library
to get a book on the game,

11:33.000 --> 11:35.400
and I was like, "You don't
play king-seven off-suit?"

11:35.440 --> 11:38.560
It was such a shock to me,
cos I had no idea.

11:38.600 --> 11:43.480
And then me, Regev and Oren,
we'd play in the basement
just for fun.

11:43.520 --> 11:47.720
[Oren] When he started, we knew
that he was always gonna be
really good at it.

11:47.760 --> 11:50.520
When he puts a target,
he'll do anything to get it.

11:52.360 --> 11:55.720
Playing poker, you saw
there was a gleam in his eye.

11:55.760 --> 11:58.040
I think that's when
a light went off

11:58.080 --> 12:01.480
and Daniel started hosting
more games at our home
in the basement.

12:01.520 --> 12:05.920
He'd have his friends over and
you'd see people coming in
and out of the house.

12:05.960 --> 12:09.720
And some people would have
smiles and some people
would leave

12:09.760 --> 12:13.400
being really upset because
he would just clean them out.

12:13.440 --> 12:16.320
He made so much money
it was like a clinic.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.840
And, even to this day,
it makes me laugh!

12:21.240 --> 12:23.840
[Daniel] From there,
we escalated to some
of the private clubs.

12:23.880 --> 12:27.920
And they were all older guys.
They were in their 40s, 50s
and beyond.

12:27.960 --> 12:30.400
So I was the young kid.
I was "Kid Poker".

12:30.440 --> 12:33.680
After about two, three months
of playing with this
regular crew,

12:33.720 --> 12:36.280
I started to become
a winner myself.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.320
Something changed.

12:38.360 --> 12:40.520
School didn't become
his priority any more.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.760
He does well when he's there.

12:42.800 --> 12:45.320
But attendance was a problem.

12:45.360 --> 12:48.040
[Daniel] Well, to be honest,
my mother was not supportive

12:48.080 --> 12:49.960
of what I was doing
as a teenager.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.880
My dad was. He was like on
the black market as a kid.

12:52.920 --> 12:56.960
He was kind of a hustler.
He knew I'd be okay.
My mother was more concerned.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.080
She said, "Daniel, forget about
the poker. You go to school!"

13:02.000 --> 13:04.920
[Mike] We were always taught
to believe you go to school,

13:04.960 --> 13:07.640
you follow the rules,
you get a good job.

13:07.680 --> 13:09.960
And you work and you're
gonna have a good life.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.280
But for Daniel that
wasn't the case.

13:12.320 --> 13:14.240
My brother wrote his own rules.

13:16.720 --> 13:20.760
I really started to take
it seriously when I was
playing in charity casinos,

13:20.800 --> 13:23.160
Monday to Friday, noon to eight.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.040
We'd play $10, $20
limit hold'em,

13:25.080 --> 13:28.320
and I was making
about $44 an hour.

13:28.360 --> 13:32.080
You know, my teacher,
he'd be trying to tell me
what to do and I'm like,

13:32.120 --> 13:34.680
"At 18, 19, I make
more money than you do.

13:34.720 --> 13:36.880
Why would I listen
to you? Pff!"

13:40.600 --> 13:44.920
I felt such a passion for poker
and I felt like this was
my calling

13:44.960 --> 13:48.960
that I didn't even finish
high school, despite the fact
that I loved school.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.400
[Mike] In the beginning,
my mother was totally against
my brother playing poker,

13:52.440 --> 13:55.160
for the simple reason
that it wasn't a career.

13:55.200 --> 13:59.640
It wasn't received well
by her peers.

13:59.680 --> 14:01.720
My mother was on the phone
with one of her friends.

14:01.760 --> 14:05.080
Her friend said, "I don't want
my son doing what yours does."

14:05.120 --> 14:07.840
And this is a guy
who sold car stereos

14:07.880 --> 14:11.120
out of the back of a truck that
were stolen, as well as cocaine.

14:11.160 --> 14:15.200
And my mother, being
fierce, the way she was,

14:15.240 --> 14:19.560
she let her have it
and she defended my brother.

14:19.600 --> 14:24.360
When my mother saw that
her friend put Daniel down,

14:24.400 --> 14:26.480
that was it.

14:26.520 --> 14:30.440
And we knew. Then, after
that point, my mother
was proud to say,

14:30.480 --> 14:34.680
"My son, he's a poker player
and he's good."

14:34.720 --> 14:36.760
So I remember that moment,
thinking to myself,

14:36.800 --> 14:39.240
"I want to make my mother
proud of what I do."

14:41.720 --> 14:46.040
[Mike] It was interesting.
After my brother would come
home from playing poker,

14:46.080 --> 14:51.760
my mother would always ask,
"Daniel..." Or she'd say,
"Danielle. How d'you do today?"

14:51.800 --> 14:56.320
He's like, "Oh, Mummy,
you know, I did okay. I was up,
I was down, I was even."

14:56.360 --> 14:59.440
But every now and then, he would
just like, he would take money.

14:59.480 --> 15:03.720
He would have like a fat stack
of cash and he would throw it
on the ground.

15:03.760 --> 15:05.640
He'd say, "Mummy, look.
What is that?"

15:05.680 --> 15:09.040
And she would look and
she'd go, "Wooh-hoo!"

15:09.080 --> 15:13.720
And she'd have to pick it all
up and sit there and count it,
one at a time.

15:13.760 --> 15:17.800
I think that made him laugh,
just feel good because

15:17.840 --> 15:21.880
my mother, growing up,
she never had much of anything.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.760
And then my brother
would come home in a car,

15:24.800 --> 15:28.280
a Honda Prelude, that he won
in a poker game.

15:28.320 --> 15:30.960
So my mother said, "Daniel,
where did you get this car?"

15:31.000 --> 15:33.520
"Ah, don't worry about it,
Mummy. I just won it at poker."

15:33.560 --> 15:35.440
So she just looked at him.

15:35.480 --> 15:40.160
So he would come home with
like stacks of cash, cars...

15:40.200 --> 15:43.080
"How do you get all this?"
"Mummy, I play poker."

15:46.520 --> 15:49.000
My brother started touring.

15:49.040 --> 15:53.680
Going to different places,
different events, playing
different poker tournaments.

15:53.720 --> 15:56.440
Okay, let me
put the cake on light.

15:56.480 --> 16:00.880
[Mike] <i> Our dad was starting to</i>
<i>get a little ill at the time.</i>

16:00.920 --> 16:03.240
<i>But still wanted my brother...</i>

16:03.280 --> 16:05.560
to go live his dream.

16:05.600 --> 16:09.320
- Cheers, Daddy.
- Cheers, Daniel.

16:09.360 --> 16:13.160
[Daniel] My dad was a big,
strong guy. He was a boxer
as a teenager.

16:13.200 --> 16:17.240
In good health. You know,
he worked as an electrician
till he was 60-something.

16:17.280 --> 16:20.800
And then, all of a sudden,
everything about his health
just kind of faded.

16:22.480 --> 16:25.360
I was in Windsor playing poker.

16:25.400 --> 16:28.560
I remember getting a call that
my dad was really, really sick

16:28.600 --> 16:31.200
and that he might, you know,
he might go.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.960
We got in the car and we
were going to drive back,
but the roads were so icy.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.040
And I saw cars in the ditches
left and right. And I didn't
have a nice car.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.520
I'm like, "We'll never make it.
It's a three-hour drive."

16:40.560 --> 16:43.600
So we turned back and we said,
"Okay, we'll go in the morning
when it's safer."

16:43.640 --> 16:46.200
On the way back, halfway there,

16:46.240 --> 16:48.040
I got the call that
he'd passed away.

16:48.080 --> 16:50.440
So I wasn't there, you know,
for the last moments.

16:50.480 --> 16:53.600
[Mike] <i> We lost our icon.</i>

16:53.640 --> 16:55.840
This is my father's big nose.

16:55.880 --> 16:57.400
<i>He was everything to us.</i>

16:57.440 --> 16:58.840
Look who's talking!

16:58.880 --> 17:01.640
We took it all really hard.

17:01.680 --> 17:04.160
[Daniel] My dad was my superman.

17:04.200 --> 17:08.319
I had to separate myself
somewhat from the father that
I knew and this, you know,

17:08.359 --> 17:10.680
shell of who he was
when he died.

17:10.720 --> 17:14.440
[Mike] My brother
was only 21 years old.

17:14.480 --> 17:18.480
He was still young. Nothing
was concrete in his life yet.

17:18.520 --> 17:21.359
But poker was there

17:21.400 --> 17:25.640
and I think it gave him
that outlet and ability
to express himself

17:25.680 --> 17:28.480
and just...focus on something

17:28.520 --> 17:31.520
other than the pain we
were suffering as a family.

17:33.480 --> 17:35.680
My father always made
the best of things.

17:35.720 --> 17:38.200
He always believed in us kids.

17:38.240 --> 17:42.120
Whatever we did, he goes,
"Mike, Daniel,

17:42.160 --> 17:45.640
do what you have to do,
but be the best."

17:45.680 --> 17:48.120
Smile. Let's see your nice,
beautiful teeth.

17:48.160 --> 17:50.320
- My beautiful teeth?
- Yeah, smile.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.760
- Okay, if you want me to smile.
- Smile.

17:52.800 --> 17:54.440
Cheese!

17:56.880 --> 17:58.840
Daniel was always driven.

17:58.880 --> 18:00.840
And with my father's passing,

18:00.880 --> 18:03.880
I think it gave him
even more focus

18:03.920 --> 18:07.120
on being successful
at what was his passion.

18:08.960 --> 18:11.000
[Daniel] I remember,
as a teenager, watching

18:11.040 --> 18:13.440
the old ESPN footage
of the World Series of Poker

18:13.480 --> 18:16.800
and seeing Phil Hellmuth win
and being like, "Wow!
That's so cool."

18:16.840 --> 18:20.360
Just these old-school gamblers,
they had stories. They
were so interesting.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.800
Guys like Eskimo Clark and
Devilfish and all these guys.

18:23.840 --> 18:26.880
Like Sammy Farha. They came
from different worlds.

18:26.920 --> 18:28.720
I wanted to experience that.

18:30.800 --> 18:33.920
[Mike] So he made some money
here, a couple of grand,

18:33.960 --> 18:36.680
and figured, "You know what?
I'm going to give it a shot."

18:36.720 --> 18:38.840
My mother said, "Daniel,
where are you going?"

18:38.880 --> 18:42.000
"Mummy, I'm going to Vegas.
I'm going to make it."

18:48.440 --> 18:51.680
[Daniel] I remember when
I first came to Las Vegas,
I was on the Strip

18:51.720 --> 18:54.120
and I thought it was
like a fantasy land.

18:54.160 --> 18:56.880
I remember thinking to myself,
"This is where I belong."

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
I went down to the Horseshoe,
where all the history happened.

19:02.040 --> 19:05.560
I had, like, maybe
a $3,000 bankroll.

19:05.600 --> 19:09.600
And, about 24 hours later,
I had no bankroll.

19:16.440 --> 19:19.720
I left Vegas feeling distraught.

19:21.920 --> 19:24.040
I went back to Toronto
and after a few days

19:24.080 --> 19:25.720
kind of said, "Okay,
I'm going to rebuild."

19:25.760 --> 19:27.480
Had some friends who
loaned me a bit of money,

19:27.520 --> 19:29.760
so I could play ten,
20 limit hold'em games.

19:29.800 --> 19:33.040
And when I had my
next bankroll of 3,000,

19:33.080 --> 19:35.440
I made another trip to Vegas.

19:35.480 --> 19:39.000
And, er, very similar story.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.040
Five or six trips,
I went to Las Vegas,

19:43.080 --> 19:45.280
I went with a bankroll
and left without one.

19:48.720 --> 19:52.640
[Mike] There were times my
brother came back from
Vegas broke.

19:52.680 --> 19:57.280
But...he had that desire.
He says, "I'm going back.

19:57.320 --> 19:59.920
They're not going to beat me."

20:03.360 --> 20:05.600
[Daniel] Essentially,
what I would do is,

20:05.640 --> 20:08.600
there would be charter flights
on Thursdays and Sundays
back to Toronto.

20:08.640 --> 20:11.920
On Wednesday night,
if I was short on money,

20:11.960 --> 20:15.360
I would play all night till
Thursday and, if I had enough
money to stay,

20:15.400 --> 20:18.040
I would stay till Sunday
and then again I'd do
the same thing.

20:18.080 --> 20:20.880
By Saturday night, if I was
short of money, I'd play
all night

20:20.920 --> 20:24.160
and if I didn't have
any money, I'd go home
on the Sunday flight.

20:26.280 --> 20:28.320
I basically got a place
at Budget Suites.

20:28.360 --> 20:32.520
It had a TV, it had a bed,
it had a kitchen and a bathroom.

20:32.560 --> 20:35.000
You know, basic needs.

20:35.040 --> 20:38.200
And, after a while, when I would
go back to Toronto, I knew
I was coming back,

20:38.240 --> 20:40.720
so I would just keep it and
I started to keep more
and more stuff there.

20:47.280 --> 20:52.440
[Mike] In the younger years,
my mum went down to see
my brother in Vegas.

20:52.480 --> 20:55.680
Make sure he was fed, clothed.

20:55.720 --> 20:58.640
Make sure that he had family
around him and good support.

20:58.680 --> 21:02.080
Daniel was alone.
He didn't know anybody.

21:02.120 --> 21:05.120
I felt better because I could
always keep tabs on him,

21:05.160 --> 21:08.240
knowing that my mother
was there.

21:08.280 --> 21:10.600
[Daniel] She just enjoyed
being close to me.

21:10.640 --> 21:13.360
She'd cook for me, do my
laundry and all that stuff
that she wanted to do.

21:13.400 --> 21:16.320
I never made her.
That's what she wanted to do.

21:16.360 --> 21:18.520
My mother supported me
through it all.

21:21.920 --> 21:25.320
I remember a very, very,
very important story
early in my development,

21:25.360 --> 21:27.920
where I was playing
in a seven-hand game.

21:27.960 --> 21:30.240
It was like three
in the morning.

21:30.280 --> 21:32.880
And I went broke. I lost my last
chips. I went to the bathroom.

21:32.920 --> 21:34.960
Washed my face,
washed my hands.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.400
Came out. All of them were gone.

21:38.440 --> 21:41.800
It was the first time in my life
where I realised, like, "Oh,
my God! I was the sucker."

21:41.840 --> 21:44.400
They were playing because of me.

21:44.440 --> 21:46.920
In Toronto, I was a bull.
I just pushed people around.

21:46.960 --> 21:50.520
But in Vegas, they're like,
"We've seen these home-town
heroes come and go.

21:50.560 --> 21:55.360
They're a dime a dozen."
So I needed to learn how
to have a better table image.

21:55.400 --> 21:59.080
How to change the way
that I was playing.
Not just be 100% bull.

21:59.120 --> 22:02.360
I had to tone it down a
little bit. I learned a lot.

22:02.400 --> 22:05.120
From there, things started
to change for me.

22:08.080 --> 22:12.320
I was playing in a satellite,
to play in my first-ever
World Series of Poker event.

22:12.360 --> 22:16.320
Me and Todd Brunson got heads
up. I got lucky and beat him.

22:16.360 --> 22:19.360
Then he said, "Why don't
I take a piece of you in
the tournament tomorrow?"

22:19.400 --> 22:21.840
I wasn't even going to play,
cos that was all my money.

22:21.880 --> 22:25.480
But I was like, "Well, if Todd
Brunson thinks I can win,
maybe I should play."

22:25.520 --> 22:29.560
My goal was just really to enjoy
the experience and maybe cash.

22:29.600 --> 22:33.760
My first table was, you know,
a murderers' row at the time.

22:33.800 --> 22:36.960
There was Eric Seidel,
Humberto Brenes,

22:37.000 --> 22:41.920
Men Nguyen, Johnny Chan,
Dan Harrington.

22:41.960 --> 22:45.720
And I remember bluffing
Johnny Chan and thinking,

22:45.760 --> 22:48.400
"Woah! He didn't catch me."

22:48.440 --> 22:51.440
And then I caught Erik Seidel
trying to bluff me.

22:51.480 --> 22:55.920
So, in that moment, I was like,
"You know what? I can play
with these guys. I can do it."

22:55.960 --> 23:01.160
[Jennifer] I was dating Todd
Brunson. Daniel makes it
to the final table.

23:01.200 --> 23:04.320
And Todd comes home and he says,

23:04.360 --> 23:07.160
"You know, I took
a piece of this kid,

23:07.200 --> 23:11.680
but I don't really know
his name - Daniel Niagara,
Daniel N, Daniel something.

23:11.720 --> 23:14.240
And you're going to be down
at the Horseshoe playing anyway,

23:14.280 --> 23:16.560
so could you watch him
and keep an eye on him,

23:16.600 --> 23:20.520
and make sure whatever he
cashes out that you get
the money from him?"

23:20.560 --> 23:23.120
And I said, "Sure."

23:23.160 --> 23:27.240
So I was playing cash games
and I'd run over and see
how he's doing.

23:27.280 --> 23:30.000
Then I go play cash again and
run over and see how he's doing.

23:30.040 --> 23:32.680
And then ninth place left,
eighth place left,

23:32.720 --> 23:35.280
seventh place left,
sixth place left, fifth place.

23:35.320 --> 23:39.640
By fourth place, I said,
"Okay, I'm just going to quit
my cash game and watch him,

23:39.680 --> 23:43.600
cos this is ridiculous."
Cos I'm actually excited
for him and nervous for him,

23:43.640 --> 23:45.840
not even knowing
who the man is.

23:47.760 --> 23:51.040
I ended up heads up against
a kid named Dominic Bourke,

23:51.080 --> 23:54.120
who was so much better than
I was at pot limit hold'em.

23:55.920 --> 23:59.600
I got in with like a coin-flip
situation. It was 50-50.

23:59.640 --> 24:02.360
I didn't even see the card.
It was fuzzy.

24:02.400 --> 24:04.600
I looked at the crowd.
I knew most of them
were cheering for me.

24:04.640 --> 24:07.360
I saw them raise their arms,
so I must have won.

24:07.400 --> 24:09.640
And I fell to my knees.

24:09.680 --> 24:13.240
It was just surreal
because it felt like
I didn't deserve it yet,

24:13.280 --> 24:15.200
it was too early in the game.

24:15.240 --> 24:17.200
My first event
and I won already.

24:19.480 --> 24:23.160
I walked right up to him
and said, "Hi, I'm Jennifer.
Nice to meet you.

24:23.200 --> 24:26.240
Congratulations."
I gave him a big hug.

24:26.280 --> 24:28.960
And he was so excited.
We went to the bar.

24:29.000 --> 24:33.240
[Daniel] We went for beers that
night and then every night
for like a week straight,

24:33.280 --> 24:35.600
and we became really,
really close friends.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.920
[Jennifer] I never did get
the money from him like
I was supposed to!

24:37.960 --> 24:41.000
But he paid Todd the next day

24:41.040 --> 24:44.040
and that's how it all started.

24:44.080 --> 24:46.760
We were kind of inseparable
after that.

24:48.880 --> 24:51.360
At the time, I was the youngest
player ever to win a bracelet.

24:51.400 --> 24:55.160
And I remember in that moment
feeling like I've sort
of arrived, if you will.

24:55.200 --> 24:58.280
I was definitely emerging right
around that time in my career.

25:00.800 --> 25:03.600
[Jennifer] The poker world
wasn't that big back then.

25:03.640 --> 25:07.480
A lot of the big players
I was playing with,
they didn't know Daniel.

25:07.520 --> 25:10.200
A World Series of Poker
bracelet's big,

25:10.240 --> 25:14.440
but in the cash games,
it's more about being good
in the cash games.

25:14.480 --> 25:18.640
[Daniel] She was always playing
in super-high limit games.
She would let me watch her play.

25:18.680 --> 25:22.760
I would lick my chops and go,
"I wish I could play in
this game one day."

25:22.800 --> 25:24.760
[Jennifer] As far as his skill,

25:24.800 --> 25:28.280
he was probably there to play,
but as far as his bankroll,

25:28.320 --> 25:31.120
he wasn't in the shape
to play in those games.

25:31.160 --> 25:34.200
And Daniel basically
made bad decisions.

25:36.240 --> 25:38.840
[Daniel] I was kinda crazy.

25:38.880 --> 25:41.280
If I had $10,000,
I'd put it on the table.

25:41.320 --> 25:45.000
She's like, "You need some
bankroll management skills."

25:45.040 --> 25:48.440
[Jennifer] One night, I think
he had $30,000 to his name.

25:48.480 --> 25:52.440
And he was so drunk,
he couldn't even walk.

25:52.480 --> 25:56.160
And he came up to me and said,
"I'm gonna play in this game."

25:56.200 --> 26:01.640
And I'd take him aside and I
said, "Daniel, you have $30,000.
You cannot play in this game.

26:01.680 --> 26:05.600
It's one buy-in." I said,
"If you lose a couple of hands,
you're done."

26:07.360 --> 26:10.880
And it was like me hitting
my head against the wall,

26:10.920 --> 26:13.520
because he...he wasn't
going to listen to me.

26:13.560 --> 26:16.280
So he sat down and played.

26:16.320 --> 26:19.680
And he ended up going broke
and having to start over again.

26:21.560 --> 26:23.960
[Daniel] There was a lot
of doubt at that point.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.360
Months of really being
introspective and
digging deeper,

26:27.400 --> 26:30.320
and saying like, you know,
"What do I got to do
to make it work?

26:30.360 --> 26:32.960
Can I? Am I capable?
Am I good enough?"

26:33.000 --> 26:35.960
[Jennifer] You know, people
when they first are
starting poker

26:36.000 --> 26:37.760
make bad decisions.

26:37.800 --> 26:39.680
He was one of them.

26:39.720 --> 26:41.720
I'm not throwing stones
in a glass house,

26:41.760 --> 26:44.440
because I made bad decisions
when I first started out
playing.

26:44.480 --> 26:48.400
<i>So I tried to give him a little
bit of wisdom from what I knew,</i>

26:48.440 --> 26:50.440
<i>from the experience
that I had in the past.</i>

26:50.480 --> 26:53.080
And he listened.

26:53.120 --> 26:55.840
[Daniel] I learned a lot.
She's a great player.

26:55.880 --> 26:58.640
Really, really smart.
Really intuitive.

26:58.680 --> 27:02.080
And just learned a lot about
life too and sort of balance.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.080
[Jennifer] I think he probably

27:04.120 --> 27:07.000
played poker
80, 90 hours a week.

27:07.040 --> 27:11.600
Some crazy amount of hours,
grinding, trying
to build back a bankroll.

27:11.640 --> 27:17.320
Daniel put in enough hard work
to get everybody's respect
and he did work hard.

27:17.360 --> 27:22.480
[Daniel] Mirage is where I sweat
blood and tears, if you will,
really learning.

27:22.520 --> 27:25.120
But I enjoyed it.
I had so much confidence

27:25.160 --> 27:28.600
that those were just
character-building moments
for me.

27:28.640 --> 27:31.680
Cos I'd wake up in the morning
ready to go.

27:31.720 --> 27:34.440
[Jennifer] He learned a lot
of lessons, but he did learn.

27:34.480 --> 27:37.280
And the good ones do learn.

27:41.000 --> 27:45.000
My first event that I'd played
on television was in 1999.

27:45.040 --> 27:47.520
It was the US Poker
Championship.

27:47.560 --> 27:51.440
And I got heads up
against John Bonetti,

27:51.480 --> 27:54.360
who was a legend,
you know, at the time.

27:54.400 --> 27:58.280
[commentator] <i> It's going to</i>
<i>be a very exciting showdown</i>
<i>to see who can take it here.</i>

27:58.320 --> 28:01.840
<i>And a clash of eras.
John Bonetti's 71 years old.</i>

28:01.880 --> 28:05.000
<i>He has a lot of respect
for Danny, one of the
young guns coming up.</i>

28:06.840 --> 28:09.280
Going into it, I wasn't
thinking about the TV table.

28:09.320 --> 28:11.600
The night before, I thought
about what I was going to wear

28:11.640 --> 28:14.080
and it was going to be
my patented tracksuit
which was like, you know,

28:14.120 --> 28:16.640
half white, half black
with the Nike hat.

28:16.680 --> 28:19.520
I was like a mini Andre Agassi
lookalike type thing.

28:19.560 --> 28:22.520
And really green to it all,
but very comfortable, oddly.

28:22.560 --> 28:24.960
Cameras didn't bother me.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.520
I felt very comfortable
under the lights.

28:27.560 --> 28:30.360
- Want to look at 'em?
- Well, I didn't call yet.

28:30.400 --> 28:32.280
Well, I ain't got no tens.

28:32.320 --> 28:34.680
[commentator laughs]
<i>He takes it back!</i>

28:34.720 --> 28:37.400
<i>Oh, the gamesmanship here!</i>

28:37.440 --> 28:39.120
Do I want to flip?

28:39.160 --> 28:42.640
Let's give him a hand!
Attaboy, Danny. Go ahead.

28:42.680 --> 28:46.760
<i>John Bonetti looks like
he's trying to goad him
into the final showdown.</i>

28:46.800 --> 28:49.200
<i>And he's going in!</i>

28:49.240 --> 28:52.560
<i>He's going to play
the low percentage</i>

28:52.600 --> 28:55.080
<i>because he has a feeling
about the card.</i>

28:58.560 --> 29:00.680
<i>And the feeling is correct!</i>

29:00.720 --> 29:03.080
<i>Danny Negreanu
takes the spade!</i>

29:03.120 --> 29:06.680
<i>He will take a stranglehold
on this tournament.</i>

29:08.560 --> 29:11.000
<i>And it's a full boat.</i>

29:11.040 --> 29:14.960
<i>Danny Negreanu gets it done.
Hoses the show with
a full house.</i>

29:15.000 --> 29:18.480
<i>So this 25 year old
has got $210,000</i>

29:18.520 --> 29:20.720
<i>and is on top of
the poker world.</i>

29:20.760 --> 29:23.160
Bonetti's so good a player
that I decided

29:23.200 --> 29:25.160
this is going to be my best
shot at winning the tournament.

29:25.200 --> 29:27.240
Luckily a spade hit and,
you know, it's all over now.

29:27.280 --> 29:29.560
[cheering]

29:29.600 --> 29:32.720
[Jennifer] Then people started
to take him seriously.

29:32.760 --> 29:37.920
He knew he was going to be
a staple in the poker world.
He was here to stay.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.440
When I met Daniel,
he was already a legend.

29:44.480 --> 29:47.400
He had already won a bracelet.
It was in Atlantic City.

29:47.440 --> 29:50.680
I think I was 23, 22.

29:50.720 --> 29:53.600
I'm 38 now, so maybe
that was 15 years ago.

29:53.640 --> 29:57.480
I always would be asking him
questions about certain hands.

29:57.520 --> 30:00.080
He always gives
an honest answer.

30:00.120 --> 30:02.480
Right away, we became
pretty friendly.

30:02.520 --> 30:05.800
[Daniel] Phil Ivey,
Allen Cunningham.

30:05.840 --> 30:08.960
Also John Juanda.
The four of us.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.520
We're the only really young guns
that were playing in these
tournaments at the time.

30:12.560 --> 30:15.800
There was not people under 30
and we were in our early 20s.

30:15.840 --> 30:20.200
So we grew together, you know,
we learned together. We'd go
to dinners, we'd talk poker.

30:20.240 --> 30:22.960
[Phil] Every day we felt
like we were learning.
That was a good time.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.800
You don't think about those
times while they're happening.

30:25.840 --> 30:30.040
You look back on your life and
you think that was a good time.
We had a lot of fun back then.

30:32.720 --> 30:35.920
[Antonio] Daniel, obviously,
made a name for himself
right in the beginning.

30:35.960 --> 30:39.560
There was just something
about him. It's unexplainable.

30:39.600 --> 30:42.400
Super-driven and
you just kind of knew

30:42.440 --> 30:44.800
that he was going to be
the guy in poker.

30:47.880 --> 30:51.320
[Mike] We knew as a family that
Daniel was going to succeed.

30:51.360 --> 30:56.000
It wasn't a question if he
was going to, it was just
a matter of when.

30:59.160 --> 31:02.320
In the Romanian culture, when
a child turns one year old,

31:02.360 --> 31:06.680
there's a little ceremony
we have - the child's
placed in a high chair.

31:06.720 --> 31:10.560
And in that high chair
there's like a little tray.

31:10.600 --> 31:13.520
And on that tray
is various items.

31:13.560 --> 31:16.400
Those items can range from books

31:16.440 --> 31:19.360
to tools, money.

31:19.400 --> 31:24.240
And whatever items your child
picks, that's their future.

31:24.280 --> 31:29.160
The first thing my brother
grabbed was gold and money.

31:32.600 --> 31:34.480
You can't deny your destiny.

31:38.360 --> 31:42.680
[Daniel] By the end of 1999,
I had a really good year.
I won the US Poker Championship.

31:42.720 --> 31:47.040
Won a bunch in the cash games
and I had myself about
300,000 in a bag,

31:47.080 --> 31:49.440
covered in dirty laundry,

31:49.480 --> 31:53.200
with a cheque on one side
that said $210,000
Taj Mahal winner,

31:53.240 --> 31:55.200
going through the airport
with that.

31:55.240 --> 31:57.080
Brought it back to Vegas
and said, "Okay.

31:57.120 --> 32:01.200
As of January 1st the year 2000,
this is where I live."

32:05.040 --> 32:08.440
I was basically
a cash game grinder.

32:08.480 --> 32:11.640
I was playing two and 400.
I moved up to three and six,
four and eight,

32:11.680 --> 32:14.240
all the way up till
four and 8,000.

32:14.280 --> 32:18.520
So even before the poker boom,
before the WPT and the World
Series being on TV,

32:18.560 --> 32:22.600
I built up a significant
bankroll, playing in
the biggest games in the world.

32:24.280 --> 32:27.080
Ultimately, I finally
built up enough money

32:27.120 --> 32:30.000
so I could play in the big game
and got to play with Jennifer.

32:31.480 --> 32:33.720
But cash felt more like work.

32:33.760 --> 32:36.080
Going to the office, put in
your hours, get your pay cheque.

32:36.120 --> 32:39.000
Tournaments was the dessert,
the gravy.

32:39.040 --> 32:41.400
Whether I had a lot
of money or not,

32:41.440 --> 32:43.960
that was secondary.
I loved the game so much.

32:44.000 --> 32:48.120
I loved tournaments so much
because there was a beginning,
middle and an end,

32:48.160 --> 32:51.640
and there was a trophy
at the end and it was like
an accomplishment.

32:51.680 --> 32:54.240
After my bracelet in 1998,

32:54.280 --> 32:58.000
I was like, "Well, this is
easy! I'm just gonna win one
every year and whatever."

32:58.040 --> 33:01.040
But then I went year after year,

33:01.080 --> 33:04.040
and there was quite a big gap
in terms of my first
and my second bracelet.

33:06.040 --> 33:08.360
During that period, you know,
I went through some struggles.

33:08.400 --> 33:10.280
I was learning to play
a lot of the games.

33:10.320 --> 33:13.080
I was a mixed game player.
I've always been.

33:13.120 --> 33:18.360
I was playing high limits and
going through the ups and downs
and battles with the confidence.

33:18.400 --> 33:21.560
That's always something you're
going to face, especially
as you move up in levels

33:21.600 --> 33:23.160
and play against better
and better opponents.

33:23.200 --> 33:25.760
You ask yourself,
"Am I better than them,

33:25.800 --> 33:29.000
or is this my limit?
Can I not push any further?"

33:29.040 --> 33:32.160
And so, not wining
a bracelet for years,

33:32.200 --> 33:35.960
makes you feel like, "Wow!
I don't know. Maybe there's
something I'm doing wrong."

33:36.000 --> 33:40.640
And it was just a really nice
relief, if anything, to win
that second bracelet in 2003.

33:45.040 --> 33:47.240
I first came across Daniel

33:47.280 --> 33:50.000
when the WPT first came on TV.

33:50.040 --> 33:53.480
And he was kind of
on the fringes.

33:53.520 --> 33:56.560
And then that summer,
I think, it was 2004,

33:56.600 --> 33:59.480
the World Series of Poker,
it was the first year

33:59.520 --> 34:02.320
where I think they aired
the final table of
every single event.

34:02.360 --> 34:04.640
And, of course, that was an
amazing World Series for Daniel.

34:04.680 --> 34:07.360
[cheering and applause]

34:10.920 --> 34:14.400
Lately, I've been coming second,
third and that gets frustrating.
You start to wonder.

34:14.440 --> 34:16.960
I get John Juanda needling
me all the time.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.440
"You don't know how to finish!
Your short-handed game's
no good!"

34:20.480 --> 34:23.239
[he laughs]
Where's he at? Yeah!

34:23.280 --> 34:26.520
It's like a relief. I felt
like I was going to win
a bracelet this year.

34:26.560 --> 34:29.960
- This is not garbage.
- This is nice.
See the bracelet?

34:30.000 --> 34:31.920
I'm here this month
to win bracelets.

34:31.960 --> 34:34.400
I'm here to win that
Best All-round Player award.

34:34.440 --> 34:37.639
That's been my goal and
I feel like I'm halfway there.

34:37.679 --> 34:40.440
[James]
Building off the back of that,

34:40.480 --> 34:43.239
I think it was in the very
next season of the WPT,

34:43.280 --> 34:45.800
I think he won like
two events back to back.

34:47.920 --> 34:49.440
[commentator] <i> Starting out</i>
<i>in third chip position</i>

34:49.480 --> 34:51.360
<i>with 950,000 in chips,</i>

34:51.400 --> 34:53.280
<i>is 30-year-old Daniel Negreanu,</i>

34:53.320 --> 34:55.679
<i>another superstar
in the poker world,</i>

34:55.719 --> 34:58.280
<i>but has yet to claim
a WPT title.</i>

34:58.320 --> 35:00.360
<i>Let's see if he can
do it here tonight.</i>

35:00.400 --> 35:02.320
I got a phone call. It's Daniel.

35:02.360 --> 35:05.080
He says, "Mike,
I made a final table.

35:05.120 --> 35:07.440
Are you gonna come?"
I'm like, "Absolutely."

35:08.840 --> 35:10.600
He was in the zone.

35:10.640 --> 35:13.000
There was nothing you could
do that day to beat him.

35:13.040 --> 35:15.120
<i>- 60 to call.
- That's a very nice lay down.</i>

35:15.160 --> 35:18.560
<i>Oh, look at this!
Daniel shows him a queen.</i>

35:18.600 --> 35:22.640
<i>- Yes, he does.
- But what a little toy play
Daniel made there.</i>

35:22.680 --> 35:25.560
<i>Putting doubt in the mind
of Josh. You can read it
on his face.</i>

35:25.600 --> 35:27.360
<i>He thinks he laid
down the best hand.</i>

35:27.400 --> 35:29.280
300,000.

35:29.320 --> 35:31.280
<i>This is a great value bet
by Daniel Negreanu here.</i>

35:31.320 --> 35:33.680
- The flop master, everybody.
- The flop master!

35:35.160 --> 35:37.080
[Mike] Me and my mother,

35:37.120 --> 35:40.720
we were just ecstatic
to watch him in his element.

35:40.760 --> 35:44.920
He was playing so good and just
to watch people cheer for him,

35:44.960 --> 35:48.640
that was like, "Wow, people are
cheering for my little brother."

35:48.680 --> 35:51.080
It was just an amazing day.

35:51.120 --> 35:53.720
- You're all in?
- Yeah.

35:55.200 --> 35:57.120
<i>- What is he waiting on?</i>
- I call.

35:57.160 --> 35:59.400
<i>- Well, he does call.
- He was being dramatic.</i>

35:59.440 --> 36:01.640
<i>Of course he's gonna call it!</i>

36:01.680 --> 36:04.720
<i>- You got aces versus kings.</i>
- Two aces.

36:04.760 --> 36:07.640
<i>- They're very close in chips.</i>
- Nice slow roll.

36:11.720 --> 36:13.840
- Yeah! That's a good one.
- <i> Well, a jack comes off.</i>

36:13.880 --> 36:17.760
<i>Right now, David Williams
must catch a king.</i>

36:17.800 --> 36:20.680
<i>This thing could be over.</i>

36:20.720 --> 36:22.680
<i>- It is over!
- It is.</i>

36:22.720 --> 36:25.160
<i>Daniel Negreanu
is our champion.</i>

36:25.200 --> 36:27.360
<i>He has done it!</i>

36:27.400 --> 36:29.360
- Aah! Yeah!
<i>- Wow!</i>

36:29.400 --> 36:31.880
Finally! Yes!

36:31.920 --> 36:35.760
- Yeah!
<i>- Well, you see</i>
<i>the jubilation in Daniel.</i>

36:35.800 --> 36:38.520
[cheering and applause]

36:49.000 --> 36:53.480
[Daniel] A few months later,
a week before the final
event of 2004,

36:53.520 --> 36:57.360
a gentleman by the name of
David Pham had passed me in the
Card Player of the Year race.

37:00.200 --> 37:05.480
So I needed out of 400 players
to come in the top nine in the
World Poker Tour event there.

37:05.520 --> 37:07.400
Not only did I make
the top nine,

37:07.440 --> 37:09.880
I did so with the biggest
chip lead in history.

37:09.920 --> 37:12.360
[commentator]
<i>Nearly $7 million in chips!</i>

37:12.400 --> 37:15.560
<i>- Oh, boy!
- He's the man in poker right
now. Daniel Negreanu.</i>

37:15.600 --> 37:17.760
<i>He's the Tournament Player
of the Year</i>

37:17.800 --> 37:20.160
<i>and he's got a commanding
chip lead here.</i>

37:20.200 --> 37:21.880
<i>He'll be the man to beat
for sure tonight.</i>

37:21.920 --> 37:24.680
- I'm all in.
- Ah! I knew you'd do that.

37:24.720 --> 37:28.480
<i>- She's going all in.
- There's no friends on the
green felt, that's for sure.</i>

37:28.520 --> 37:31.080
<i>Right back into the chip
leader's face.</i>

37:31.120 --> 37:33.320
[cheering and applause]

37:33.360 --> 37:36.000
<i>Okay, he's going lay it down.</i>

37:36.040 --> 37:38.280
<i>A nice re-raise there
by Jennifer.</i>

37:38.320 --> 37:40.560
You keep trying that,
little girl.

37:40.600 --> 37:45.360
<i>Just a tremendous over-raise
by Kid Poker, Daniel Negreanu.</i>

37:45.400 --> 37:47.680
<i>$4 million and I can tell
you, folks,</i>

37:47.720 --> 37:49.800
<i>when you get hit with
a re-raise like that,</i>

37:49.840 --> 37:52.960
<i>your two fives shrivel up
like a spider on a hot stove.</i>

37:53.000 --> 37:55.840
<i>- And it's gonna work.</i>
- You're not gonna like it.

37:55.880 --> 37:59.040
<i>Daniel shows him
the three, folks!</i>

37:59.080 --> 38:02.280
<i>Now that is like a kidney
blow if you're Humberto
Brenes right now.</i>

38:02.320 --> 38:04.840
<i>That is the needle
extraordinaire.</i>

38:04.880 --> 38:06.960
Oh, no!

38:07.000 --> 38:08.920
3.4 million.

38:08.960 --> 38:11.400
I've never been able
to say that before.

38:11.440 --> 38:14.320
- That's so fun.
- Okay, you can have it!

38:14.360 --> 38:17.840
Can you make any suggestions?
How about...4.2 million?

38:17.880 --> 38:20.640
<i>That's gonna set both
his opponents all in.</i>

38:20.680 --> 38:23.160
[applause]

38:23.200 --> 38:27.840
<i>This power poker being
demonstrated by Daniel
Negreanu right now.</i>

38:27.880 --> 38:31.360
<i>Daniel knows he'll get
paid off on the turn.</i>

38:31.400 --> 38:33.960
<i>He's assuming Humberto
puts him on a draw.</i>

38:34.000 --> 38:37.400
<i>He's gonna bet the four
of a kind. 550,000.
Humberto quickly calls him,</i>

38:37.440 --> 38:39.840
<i>thinking ace high might
be the best hand.</i>

38:39.880 --> 38:42.560
<i>- Oh, my gosh!
- Look at Humberto.</i>

38:42.600 --> 38:46.400
<i>You can just feel the air going
out of his balloons there.</i>

38:48.960 --> 38:52.440
<i>Going for the big... That's
a million he's setting
out there, folks.</i>

38:52.480 --> 38:55.320
<i>Humberto's going
all in with him.</i>

38:55.360 --> 38:58.080
<i>A major mistake here
by Humberto.</i>

38:59.800 --> 39:02.240
<i>So here we go.</i>

39:02.280 --> 39:06.360
<i>- Nearly $6 million
in this pot.
- Daniel clenches the fist.</i>

39:06.400 --> 39:09.440
<i>He can taste his second World
Poker Tour title here
right now.</i>

39:09.480 --> 39:12.200
<i>- Here's the turn.
- Well, a six comes off.</i>

39:12.240 --> 39:14.160
<i>Daniel doesn't like that card.</i>

39:14.200 --> 39:17.320
<i>He knows a five will win
the pot right now for Humberto,</i>

39:17.360 --> 39:19.960
<i>as well as an eight.</i>

39:20.000 --> 39:22.480
<i>Here comes the river.</i>

39:24.280 --> 39:27.480
- Yes!
<i>- Daniel Negreanu has done it!</i>

39:27.520 --> 39:31.760
<i>He is due in the elite company
of Gus Hanson, Howard
Lederer and Eric Lindgren,</i>

39:31.800 --> 39:34.640
<i>to capture his second
World Poker Tour title.</i>

39:34.680 --> 39:36.480
Mummy!

39:36.520 --> 39:39.520
<i>Look at this, Kid Poker
going into the stands!</i>

39:39.560 --> 39:41.320
That's two, baby! That's two!

39:41.360 --> 39:43.160
<i>The leading money winner
on the World Poker Tour</i>

39:43.200 --> 39:46.200
<i>gets a big hug from
Mrs Negreanu, his mom.</i>

39:46.240 --> 39:49.840
<i>- Gotta be so proud.</i>
- [applause]

39:49.880 --> 39:52.600
It's like just the perfect way
to go out

39:52.640 --> 39:55.600
and end like an amazing year
in 2004.

39:55.640 --> 39:59.680
[James] He won his WPT titles
and he won Player of the Year

39:59.720 --> 40:03.160
and clearly established himself
as one of, if not the best,

40:03.200 --> 40:05.400
tournament poker players
in the world.

40:07.320 --> 40:11.200
[Mike] My mother was
just amazed at how well

40:11.240 --> 40:14.720
Daniel's career progressed.

40:14.760 --> 40:19.240
She was my brother's biggest
supporter. His biggest fan.

40:19.280 --> 40:23.240
It's funny that my mother
chooses, like when I get
heads up, to go to the buffet.

40:23.280 --> 40:26.800
My mother she prepares me every
day. She brings me a lunch.
She's really supportive.

40:26.840 --> 40:30.040
She's out here for the month
to make my life easier.

40:30.080 --> 40:32.760
And all that other stuff
that seems insignificant,

40:32.800 --> 40:35.920
is so much more important
than people give it credit for.

40:35.960 --> 40:41.040
Eventually, she was coming
so often that I bought
my mum a house,

40:41.080 --> 40:43.200
like five minutes down the road.

40:43.240 --> 40:45.520
[Mike] She was there for him.

40:45.560 --> 40:48.280
Every morning,
she had to make his lunch.

40:48.320 --> 40:51.400
My brother was probably
the only guy... [he laughs]

40:51.440 --> 40:55.240
..playing who brought
a brown bag of lunch

40:55.280 --> 40:56.960
to the poker table.

40:57.000 --> 41:00.080
It's amazing because...

41:00.120 --> 41:03.080
he was doing well and
there was an instance where

41:03.120 --> 41:06.440
Mummy gave Phil Ivey a lunch.

41:06.480 --> 41:08.680
And, after that,
he was doing well, too.

41:10.920 --> 41:13.840
So it became a little joke,
where like...

41:13.880 --> 41:15.840
"Mummy's got to make
everybody lunch,

41:15.880 --> 41:18.200
cos if she does it,
then we're all gonna do well."

41:18.240 --> 41:22.000
- What did your mum
make us for dinner?
- A little of everything.

41:22.040 --> 41:24.840
[Daniel] <i> I remember being</i>
<i>31 years old and she made</i>
<i>me some soup,</i>

41:24.880 --> 41:27.040
and I got the spoon and
I'm putting it to my mouth,

41:27.080 --> 41:29.320
and she blows on it.
I'm like, "Mum, I'm 31!

41:29.360 --> 41:31.960
You gotta stop." She's like,
"You're always gonna
be my baby."

41:33.520 --> 41:35.480
[Jennifer]
Daniel adored his mother.

41:35.520 --> 41:37.480
The relationship
was like that.

41:39.160 --> 41:41.720
There was so much respect there.

41:41.760 --> 41:45.120
And she was always
rooting for him.

41:45.160 --> 41:47.560
It was just an amazing thing
to watch.

41:49.480 --> 41:52.240
[Mike] There was one time,
she's driving on the freeway

41:52.280 --> 41:56.000
and she looks up and she
sees my brother's face
on a big billboard.

41:56.040 --> 42:00.360
And she called me. She says,
"Mike, Daniel's face
is all over.

42:00.400 --> 42:03.800
It's on the highway."
I said, "I know, Mummy."

42:03.840 --> 42:07.520
We always knew it was going
to be okay.

42:07.560 --> 42:09.080
He made it happen.

42:11.160 --> 42:13.440
I have six World Series Poker
bracelets.

42:13.480 --> 42:17.280
Two World Poker Tour titles.
Number one on the all-time
money list.

42:17.320 --> 42:19.480
I won the World Series Poker
Player of the Year twice.

42:22.920 --> 42:25.360
There's so many moments
that I treasure,

42:25.400 --> 42:28.120
but the ones that I love the
most are like when it's
bottom of the ninth

42:28.160 --> 42:30.240
and you've just gotta do it.

42:30.280 --> 42:32.960
In 2013,

42:33.000 --> 42:35.920
it looked like Matthew Ashton
had the World Series Poker
Player of the Year locked up.

42:38.600 --> 42:42.200
In the Main Event, I came 25th
and it wasn't quite enough
to pass him.

42:42.240 --> 42:44.640
I had one more shot.

42:44.680 --> 42:47.160
So I jumped in late
into the High Roller.

42:47.200 --> 42:50.120
And I was in an interesting
situation because I needed
to come in eighth

42:50.160 --> 42:52.320
to win Player of the Year.

42:52.360 --> 42:54.680
There was a money bubble
at nine, so two guys
were just folding.

42:54.720 --> 42:58.120
I'm like, "Ah!"
You know? I just want to
move up a couple of spots

42:58.160 --> 43:01.080
and win the Player of the Year,
but, at the same time,
there's a bracelet on the line.

43:01.120 --> 43:04.000
Those two guys
eventually went broke,

43:04.040 --> 43:06.760
so it just worked out
like a Hollywood script.

43:06.800 --> 43:09.720
[commentator]
<i>We're down to eight.</i>

43:09.760 --> 43:12.000
<i>Daniel, the extreme
short stack.</i>

43:12.040 --> 43:15.120
<i>Negreanu at risk.
Another eight!</i>

43:15.160 --> 43:17.000
- Yeah!
<i>- They'll chop it.</i>

43:17.040 --> 43:19.000
Oh, yes!

43:19.040 --> 43:21.200
- Woo!
<i>- Daniel survives.</i>

43:21.240 --> 43:24.360
[he laughs]
Staying alive! Staying alive!

43:24.400 --> 43:27.560
<i>And they're racing for
Daniel's tournament life.</i>

43:27.600 --> 43:30.440
Ace or a king
for all the cheese!

43:30.480 --> 43:32.800
I feel it coming.

43:32.840 --> 43:35.200
I feel the mojo. Ace or a king.

43:35.240 --> 43:39.560
<i>- Negreanu at risk.
- Ace in the flop! Mojo found!</i>

43:39.600 --> 43:41.080
<i>Daniel in party mode.</i>

43:43.640 --> 43:47.320
- There may be no one worse to
lose to than Daniel Negreanu.
- You're pretty bad.

43:47.360 --> 43:51.720
<i>It's not a ten and not what
the rest of the table
wanted to see.</i>

43:51.760 --> 43:55.440
<i>Five-time bracelet winner
Daniel Negreanu with more than
a million chips!</i>

43:55.480 --> 43:57.520
<i>What a run he's enjoying.</i>

43:57.560 --> 44:00.200
<i>He was all in like five minutes
ago for seven big blinds!</i>

44:00.240 --> 44:02.760
<i>Not resting on his newly won
Player of the Year laurels,</i>

44:02.800 --> 44:05.280
<i>Negreanu out for
bracelet number six.</i>

44:05.320 --> 44:08.760
<i>Negreanu spikes it.
Seiver pays the price.</i>

44:11.080 --> 44:13.880
<i>Negreanu's charmed
tournament run continues,</i>

44:13.920 --> 44:16.320
<i>as he knocks out Timothy Adams.</i>

44:16.360 --> 44:19.960
<i>Gruissem comes up empty and
will fall in third place.</i>

44:20.000 --> 44:21.960
See you at the bar in a bit.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.560
<i>Bracelet number six
is coming into focus.</i>

44:24.600 --> 44:27.960
<i>All in, snap call,
just like that.</i>

44:28.000 --> 44:30.640
<i>Negreanu a strong favourite
to win this hand</i>

44:30.680 --> 44:33.200
<i>and bracelet number six.</i>

44:33.240 --> 44:36.360
<i>Queen, nine, deuce.
No help to Villa-Lobos.</i>

44:36.400 --> 44:38.240
<i>Turn card, king of diamonds,</i>

44:38.280 --> 44:41.200
<i>brings Daniel one card
closer to victory.</i>

44:41.240 --> 44:45.200
<i>Trey of clubs and
Daniel Negreanu</i>

44:45.240 --> 44:49.800
<i>completes a remarkable comeback
to win bracelet number six!</i>

44:49.840 --> 44:51.920
[applause]

44:56.320 --> 45:00.000
Well, I said I was
going to do it.

45:00.040 --> 45:02.840
[cheering and applause]

45:02.880 --> 45:05.720
So I was the little itty-bitty
short stack at the final table.

45:05.760 --> 45:07.800
But I won it anyway.

45:09.960 --> 45:12.800
I think if you had to identify
Daniel's unique talent

45:12.840 --> 45:16.120
or what he is best at,
it's clearly

45:16.160 --> 45:20.640
reading situations,
reading people and eliciting
information from them.

45:22.520 --> 45:24.800
We know that Daniel's a
chatterbox and loves to talk,

45:24.840 --> 45:28.120
and I believe he does that
because he wants the table
to be lively

45:28.160 --> 45:31.600
and he wants a good atmosphere
at the table, but
the by-product of that

45:31.640 --> 45:34.320
is he's able to gain
information from people.

45:34.360 --> 45:36.160
Okay, friendly game.

45:36.200 --> 45:38.200
Lots of fun stuff
happening on that board.

45:40.440 --> 45:44.360
I learned many years ago
I hate to fold,
so I don't fold any more.

45:44.400 --> 45:47.120
Feeling comfortable right now.
See?

45:47.160 --> 45:51.040
You can tell by my energy.
Relaxed. What does that
usually mean? Huh? What?

45:51.080 --> 45:54.640
Hey! Soon as I start yapping
he goes in.

45:54.680 --> 45:58.120
Oh, man! Woo! Scare card.

45:58.160 --> 46:00.600
- Show one card.
- I'll show you one
after you fold.

46:00.640 --> 46:04.040
How about if I gave you $1,000
out of my pocket?

46:04.080 --> 46:08.080
- Even if you gave me a million,
I wouldn't show you.
- A million?!

46:08.120 --> 46:10.440
I love that bet.
That's beautiful!

46:10.480 --> 46:13.160
I don't know what you have
but I just think that was
a really good move.

46:13.200 --> 46:15.960
- [he laughs]
- Whatever next?

46:16.000 --> 46:18.760
You know, I tell myself
jokes sometimes.

46:18.800 --> 46:21.400
They're appropriate for TV.
That make me laugh.

46:27.400 --> 46:30.800
I told you I have three threes
and you just don't care?

46:30.840 --> 46:35.120
Well, if I talk too much, I
might let you know what I have.

46:35.160 --> 46:37.800
Don't ever talk to Daniel!

46:37.840 --> 46:41.280
He's always fishing for
information. Do not
give it to him.

46:41.320 --> 46:44.320
He's looking very GQ. He's got
the sweater, he's got the shirt.

46:44.360 --> 46:49.160
The pants are pressed. Have you
got bronzer on, the whole deal?

46:49.200 --> 46:52.320
Oh! It's really hard
to be bluffing.

46:52.360 --> 46:55.200
- You're special though.
- That's what I've been told.

46:55.240 --> 46:57.720
- You live in Hollywood now?
- Huh?

46:57.760 --> 46:59.400
- You live in Hollywood now?
- Why?

46:59.440 --> 47:01.320
You've learned a lot from
those guys in Hollywood.

47:01.360 --> 47:03.160
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it was very good.

47:03.200 --> 47:05.240
I was reading the whole thing,
the whole move.

47:05.280 --> 47:08.200
It was very good. I was going
to give you a standing ovation.

47:08.240 --> 47:10.720
I think you had
a good hand, Eugene.

47:10.760 --> 47:13.120
- I think you had a good hand.
- That's a good reading.

47:14.400 --> 47:15.760
Sick, right?

47:19.040 --> 47:23.480
Obviously, he's very smart with
math, but he's a people person

47:23.520 --> 47:28.360
and he knows how to figure out
what somebody has.

47:28.400 --> 47:31.000
It's a tough, tough, tough
decision. I'm gonna
need a minute.

47:31.040 --> 47:33.840
Why would you raise me now?
I guess you would, yeah.

47:35.480 --> 47:37.520
Do you have fives?

47:37.560 --> 47:39.760
Ah! Whatever!

47:39.800 --> 47:45.000
- Seven is my card today.
- You don't have seven.
Don't believe it.

47:45.040 --> 47:48.160
I fold, but did
you have ace, king?

47:48.200 --> 47:50.680
You had like jacks or queens
or something like that?

47:50.720 --> 47:53.160
Is that what you have?
With a spade?

47:53.200 --> 47:55.840
Is that what you have? Jacks
or queens with spade?
Oh, I got it!

47:55.880 --> 47:58.200
He smiled! That's what he's got!

47:58.240 --> 48:00.680
I'm smiling because
you are talking.

48:00.720 --> 48:03.080
Oh, I love to talk.
I don't shut up.

48:03.120 --> 48:07.040
Just keep bluh, bluh, bluh.
Diarrhoea of the mouth.
Can't help myself.

48:07.080 --> 48:09.840
Call, because you're Negreanu.

48:09.880 --> 48:13.280
This is fun. I love
having fun playing poker.

48:16.320 --> 48:20.160
He basically takes
his emotion out of it

48:20.200 --> 48:21.960
and plays almost robotic.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.080
Obviously, he's talkative,

48:24.120 --> 48:26.080
but I'm sure while
he's talking

48:26.120 --> 48:29.320
50,000 questions are going off
in his brain,

48:29.360 --> 48:31.200
as he's trying to figure
stuff out.

48:31.240 --> 48:33.800
And he's very, very
good at that.

48:33.840 --> 48:37.520
And he does not stereotype.

48:37.560 --> 48:40.440
He always gives people
the benefit of the doubt,

48:40.480 --> 48:43.320
until they prove him wrong.

48:43.360 --> 48:45.680
<i>What Daniel does
is pretty simple.</i>

48:45.720 --> 48:47.440
<i>He says you get
into someone's head, </i>

48:47.480 --> 48:49.560
<i>understand how they
approach the game</i>

48:49.600 --> 48:52.560
<i>and you play their tendencies.
It's just hard to master.</i>

48:52.600 --> 48:54.560
<i>Traudt check raises all in!</i>

48:54.600 --> 48:57.600
<i>I had you on the flop
and you got me on the turn.</i>

48:57.640 --> 49:00.560
[commentator laughs]
<i>He's right again.</i>

49:00.600 --> 49:04.920
I had you, but then that card
changed your leader.
I'm pretty sure, right?

49:04.960 --> 49:09.280
You had like some kind of a nine
in your hand, right? King, nine?

49:09.320 --> 49:11.040
<i>King, nine.</i>

49:11.080 --> 49:14.200
- Take it.
<i>- Daniel folds!</i>

49:14.240 --> 49:16.840
- You're a sick human.
- King, nine?

49:16.880 --> 49:19.160
<i>King, nine.</i>

49:19.200 --> 49:22.560
- I did it again! Yes!
- [commentator laughs]

49:22.600 --> 49:24.560
[applause]

49:24.600 --> 49:27.640
I think the most valuable aspect
of being a great poker player

49:27.680 --> 49:31.520
is self-awareness, understanding
how people perceive you.

49:31.560 --> 49:33.560
Cos once you know how
they perceive you,

49:33.600 --> 49:35.960
you'll know how they're
going to react to it.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.880
When you're playing poker,
you have an idea of how
this person thinks,

49:38.920 --> 49:42.440
what kinds of cards they play,
are they tight or loose,
so you can pinpoint them more.

49:42.480 --> 49:46.600
But at the core, how do you
figure out those things?
What kind of person is this?

49:46.640 --> 49:50.080
And that comes from
understanding how they think
and now they view the world.

49:50.120 --> 49:52.640
And that's shaped
by their upbringing.

49:52.680 --> 49:54.920
Where they're from, what
they've done for a living,

49:54.960 --> 49:57.080
how long they've been in poker.

49:58.880 --> 50:01.040
[Mike] My brother,
when he was younger,

50:01.080 --> 50:02.560
wanted to become an actor.

50:02.600 --> 50:04.560
And he was able to sing and act,

50:04.600 --> 50:07.200
and portray the character
perfectly.

50:07.240 --> 50:11.640
And acting was his first love
and I think that's where
he gets it now,

50:11.680 --> 50:16.600
where he can change himself
and become that person
or that character.

50:19.680 --> 50:22.400
[Daniel] I love nothing more
than being under the lights

50:22.440 --> 50:25.280
on centre stage playing
the final tables.

50:25.320 --> 50:29.520
Because, innately, I already
feel like, "Okay, this
is my comfort zone."

50:29.560 --> 50:31.840
<i>Daniel Negreanu!</i>

50:31.880 --> 50:36.400
[Mike] He's able to like
take different situations
and make the best of it

50:36.440 --> 50:40.960
and become that person or
think how that person thinks.

50:42.840 --> 50:45.360
And then he uses it
against them.

50:48.800 --> 50:52.080
[Daniel] Even if I was a little
nervous, they're way more
nervous than I am.

50:52.120 --> 50:56.720
Because this is something I've
been doing for so many years.
Been there, done that.

50:58.840 --> 51:01.280
So I use that to my advantage,
if anything.

51:01.320 --> 51:04.440
I try to make them even more
uncomfortable, put them
under even more pressure.

51:05.840 --> 51:07.800
Tough one, huh? Close.

51:10.720 --> 51:12.280
<i>Talked him into it.</i>

51:12.320 --> 51:14.120
<i>He could sell ice to an Eskimo.</i>

51:16.160 --> 51:18.920
[Daniel] I can sense when people
are afraid, when they're happy.

51:18.960 --> 51:22.840
I can sense when people are
intimidated or when they're
trying to push me around.

51:24.400 --> 51:26.800
There's no tangible way
to explain it,

51:26.840 --> 51:28.720
other than, you know,
I feel it.

51:28.760 --> 51:30.680
Raise.

51:30.720 --> 51:32.480
<i>Daniel's worked out he
doesn't have the best hand</i>

51:32.520 --> 51:35.520
<i>but he does think he can
get Shlomi to fold,</i>

51:35.560 --> 51:38.080
<i>hence the bluff raise.</i>

51:38.120 --> 51:40.920
I figure you've got aces
or kings.

51:40.960 --> 51:43.000
Can I say that or
is that illegal?

51:43.040 --> 51:46.280
I can say what he has
but not what I have? Okay.

51:46.320 --> 51:49.440
- I'm thinking aces or kings.
<i>- You think right.</i>

51:49.480 --> 51:51.800
<i>Daniel really pulled the
trigger correctly on that one.</i>

51:54.680 --> 51:57.600
<i>And Shlomi's now thinking,
"If you've read me for aces
or kings,</i>

51:57.640 --> 52:00.680
<i>surely you can beat aces
or kings. I have to fold."</i>

52:00.720 --> 52:02.480
If I show one,
do I have to show all?

52:02.520 --> 52:04.880
- No.
- Okay. I can show one?

52:04.920 --> 52:08.680
I can show one if I want to? I
don't feel like it. Never mind.

52:08.720 --> 52:11.840
I don't have a good one
to show.

52:11.880 --> 52:14.640
<i>Great start for Daniel.</i>

52:14.680 --> 52:19.200
<i>Almost a double float there
and then a bluff on the river,
which got the job done.</i>

52:19.240 --> 52:23.160
<i>Negreanu wasted no time
pulling out the tricks
from his play book.</i>

52:25.760 --> 52:28.320
- Ace or kings looked good?
- Of course.

52:30.760 --> 52:35.240
I'm just saying that's what
I thought he had, but not
that I could beat it.

52:35.280 --> 52:39.000
[John] If his understanding
of the game is peerless,

52:39.040 --> 52:42.200
you don't get to be the World
Series Player of the Year

52:42.240 --> 52:44.840
and so high up on
the Global Poker Index

52:44.880 --> 52:47.440
without being
astonishingly talented.

52:50.000 --> 52:53.480
I've got about eight years
when I've won a million plus,

52:53.520 --> 52:57.320
so I'm proud of the fact
that I've been able to put
up winning years

52:57.360 --> 52:59.880
every year, despite the game
evolving and changing.

52:59.920 --> 53:02.160
I'm always able to
stay one step ahead.

53:03.800 --> 53:06.320
That's the great thing
about poker is that

53:06.360 --> 53:08.680
every time you sit down
you can get better.

53:08.720 --> 53:11.760
You can always play a hand
a little bit better
or a bit differently

53:11.800 --> 53:16.640
and make a situation better
and you just have to work at it.

53:18.960 --> 53:21.640
[Daniel] Online poker's
changed the game immensely.

53:21.680 --> 53:25.160
All of a sudden, a lot of
players got really, really good.

53:25.200 --> 53:28.120
When I first came into the game,
if you didn't know somebody,

53:28.160 --> 53:30.360
you could assume
they were not right,

53:30.400 --> 53:33.000
because if you didn't know them,
that means they hadn't been
playing.

53:33.040 --> 53:36.520
Now, you'll sit with a kid
who looks like he's barely
old enough to be there

53:36.560 --> 53:40.800
and, meanwhile, he's got
20 million hands of experience
in the last six months.

53:40.840 --> 53:43.120
You know? And he's really,
really good.

53:43.160 --> 53:46.360
So the anonymity factors
in and it's a different
playing field now,

53:46.400 --> 53:48.520
where the average player
is just much better.

53:48.560 --> 53:52.280
They're playing a lot more
close to what's optimum.

53:52.320 --> 53:56.480
[Maria] I think the reason
why Daniel maintained that
level of success

53:56.520 --> 53:59.800
and actually even gotten better
is because he's willing to

53:59.840 --> 54:02.760
adapt to all of these
young guns coming in

54:02.800 --> 54:07.120
and all of these different,
new theories in poker.
He appreciates that,

54:07.160 --> 54:09.640
you know, just because
you're good five years ago,

54:09.680 --> 54:11.600
doesn't mean you're
gonna be good now,

54:11.640 --> 54:13.920
and you really have to keep
up to date with everything.

54:16.000 --> 54:19.800
Part of what I like to do when
I play is use my people skills.

54:19.840 --> 54:23.600
That's not really an option
online, but what I found fun

54:23.640 --> 54:27.680
was just sort of like focusing
on the fundamentals
and the math and the stats,

54:27.720 --> 54:30.520
and the numbers, cos I've
always been a numbers geek.

54:30.560 --> 54:34.040
So definitely
took some adjusting,
understanding a little better.

54:34.080 --> 54:37.840
Like, "I can't get away with
doing all my sloppy stuff,

54:37.880 --> 54:41.680
because I can't get a read
later in the hand where
I can, you know,

54:41.720 --> 54:44.400
use that to my advantage."

54:44.440 --> 54:49.400
I decided to relearn a lot
of the stuff that these kids
are learning and adjust.

54:49.440 --> 54:54.000
And also just realising, "What
areas do I need to improve on?"
And being honest with myself.

54:54.040 --> 54:56.400
There was a time when I went
back to playing on Poker Stars

54:56.440 --> 54:59.840
for quite a while, where I was
grinding in the big cash
games - 100, 200.

54:59.880 --> 55:02.280
People were like, "Oh, he'll
never succeed!" Whatever.

55:02.320 --> 55:07.480
It wasn't about them.
It was about me testing
myself and pushing myself.

55:07.520 --> 55:10.720
I've been playing this game
a long time and I do feel
like I've reached my peak.

55:10.760 --> 55:13.120
Cos I've combined
all the sort of moves

55:13.160 --> 55:16.200
with some wisdom and patience
and discipline.

55:16.240 --> 55:18.400
I see some kids doing things
and I'm like... [laughs]

55:18.440 --> 55:21.000
"I might have done that 15 years
ago, but I know better now."

55:25.080 --> 55:29.680
[Jennifer] He grew up
and now he's...more wise.

55:29.720 --> 55:32.960
He's confident. Although
he does have his faults.

55:33.000 --> 55:36.480
He's a little arrogant.
He always has to be right.

55:38.200 --> 55:40.040
I remember one time,

55:40.080 --> 55:42.040
we were playing
in the same game.

55:42.080 --> 55:44.360
And I got beat
by a straight flush.

55:46.720 --> 55:49.960
Daniel said I should
have bet on the turn. And
I said, "I did bet on the turn."

55:50.000 --> 55:54.240
And he said, "No, you didn't."
I said, "Yes, I did. I played
the hand. I bet on the turn."

55:54.280 --> 55:57.000
I know what was going through
my mind during the hand.

55:57.040 --> 56:00.000
He says, "I'll bet you $20,000
that you didn't bet
on the turn."

56:00.040 --> 56:02.840
I said, "Alright, Daniel,
we'll bet this."

56:02.880 --> 56:06.280
And Phil Ivey was also in
the game, so we called Phil

56:06.320 --> 56:10.000
and asked him about this hand,
and Phil said, "Yes,
she bet on the turn."

56:10.040 --> 56:13.200
So it was like sweet!

56:13.240 --> 56:17.160
Finally, you know,
I won an argument.

56:17.200 --> 56:20.480
I don't think we ever settled
on that bet, by the way.

56:22.640 --> 56:24.720
I might have to call him up.

56:24.760 --> 56:28.640
He went through a phase
where his kind of ego ran riot.

56:28.680 --> 56:31.960
I do like Floyd. This move.
Check, check, check.

56:32.000 --> 56:34.320
He's comparing himself
to Floyd Mayweather now.

56:34.360 --> 56:36.520
He was always a presence
cos he's always very loud.

56:36.560 --> 56:41.400
Spade, spade! I win! Sweet!
There's no way you can win now.

56:41.440 --> 56:44.720
He's a huge personality.
You will know if you're
at a table with him.

56:44.760 --> 56:46.840
You'll probably know if
you're in the same room as him.

56:46.880 --> 56:52.120
- Cards good, flop good.
- Jesus!

56:52.160 --> 56:55.680
He's very one for the rules.
I remember, we were playing
in a limit hold'em event.

56:55.720 --> 56:57.320
It must have been about 2000,
I think.

56:57.360 --> 56:59.880
There were about 17 of us left.

56:59.920 --> 57:04.040
The WSOP had just introduced
this new rule which meant
that your bum

57:04.080 --> 57:08.200
had to be in your seat
when the last card was dealt.

57:08.240 --> 57:12.080
And I remember, I was playing
at the same table as Daniel,

57:12.120 --> 57:15.120
and my legs were tired,
so I stood up at my seat,

57:15.160 --> 57:17.960
and I was stretching. Literally,
all I was doing was stretching.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.360
I hadn't gone anywhere.
I was stretching.

57:20.400 --> 57:24.760
And the dealer dealt the last
card and I saw Daniel
nod to the dealer.

57:24.800 --> 57:29.880
Like going, you know, because
my bum wasn't in my seat right.

57:29.920 --> 57:33.800
And suddenly the dealer mucked
my hand in the big blind
and I just freaked out.

57:33.840 --> 57:37.000
I said, "What are you doing?
This is just stupid.

57:37.040 --> 57:39.520
You've got to use some
common sense here. It's mad."

57:39.560 --> 57:42.480
At the time, I thought,
"What a tosser!"

57:42.520 --> 57:46.480
I thought, "God, you snake!"
But then I realised,
actually, he was right.

57:46.520 --> 57:50.440
He was just playing by the
rules and it was a stupid rule.

57:50.480 --> 57:54.400
Well, my big mouth gets
me in trouble on a regular
basis and I'm okay with that.

57:54.440 --> 57:57.880
[John] He's kind of
controversial in some
ways, Daniel.

57:57.920 --> 58:03.080
He often gets himself into
situations. He's not
universally liked.

58:03.120 --> 58:06.520
[Antonio] I stay away from
controversy, but Daniel
was so vocal

58:06.560 --> 58:10.560
about how he felt about certain
players and their behaviours,

58:10.600 --> 58:13.240
myself included.

58:13.280 --> 58:16.440
In a way, I kind of respected
him for that,

58:16.480 --> 58:18.560
except when it was aimed at me.

58:18.600 --> 58:21.920
So there was definitely
a couple of incidences where

58:21.960 --> 58:24.320
you know, we didn't see
eye to eye.

58:24.360 --> 58:28.720
One was where he was judgmental
of my personal behaviour

58:28.760 --> 58:31.320
that had absolutely nothing
to do with him.

58:31.360 --> 58:34.760
And, you know, I didn't believe,
and I still don't believe,

58:34.800 --> 58:37.280
that he had any right
to voice his opinion

58:37.320 --> 58:41.280
in front of other people
about something that was
personal in my life.

58:41.320 --> 58:45.120
[Daniel] Sometimes I say things
where I do cross the line.
I'm like, "Okay. Yeah, oops."

58:45.160 --> 58:48.080
But you'll do that when you
ride the line as often as I do.

58:48.120 --> 58:50.480
Sometimes you're gonna fall over
on the one side or the other.

58:50.520 --> 58:53.240
In terms of like, even
the way I word certain things.

58:53.280 --> 58:57.440
After I send a Tweet, I'm like,
"Oh, yeah, I guess I shouldn't
have said that like that."

58:57.480 --> 59:00.920
[James] Daniel obviously
feels that he wants to put
everything out there.

59:00.960 --> 59:03.720
And I disagree with him
about a lot of things.

59:03.760 --> 59:06.360
But he obviously, genuinely,
holds those opinions.

59:06.400 --> 59:10.040
And he has solid reasoning
for holding those opinions.

59:10.080 --> 59:12.640
He's willing to discuss.
He's willing to engage.

59:12.680 --> 59:15.400
He's willing to debate.

59:15.440 --> 59:19.160
If you have a belief, I don't
mind hearing it. I can have
a civil discussion about it.

59:19.200 --> 59:23.320
It doesn't mean I hate you.
I can respect others
with differing views.

59:23.360 --> 59:26.600
I've just always been somebody
that's believed wholehearted

59:26.640 --> 59:29.880
that integrity is the most
important aspect of being a man.

59:29.920 --> 59:34.320
And part of that, for me,
is being honest about
my true feelings about things.

59:34.360 --> 59:37.880
If you buy into a tournament
like, whatever,

59:37.920 --> 59:40.920
in a re-buy tournament
two hours late, for example,

59:40.960 --> 59:44.120
according to this rule,
you should only lose
three rounds of blinds.

59:44.160 --> 59:46.960
I've showed up two hours late
in the last re-buy tournament

59:47.000 --> 59:49.560
and I only had 1,125
of my 2,000.

59:49.600 --> 59:53.960
So how can you selectively
enforce a rule, not only
from tournament to tournament,

59:54.000 --> 59:57.480
but in this specific tournament?
Because I should have started
with more chips too.

59:57.520 --> 59:59.920
I'm not complaining. I'm
fine with what I started with.

59:59.960 --> 01:00:02.840
But if you're gonna start
everyone else with more
chips, bro, come on!

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:05.320
How can you selectively enforce
this rule? It makes no sense.

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:11.040
He did used to be this tribune
of the people type of character,

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:13.800
which I think some people
found quite irritating,

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:17.000
cos, if you're a tribune of
the people, you have to be an
elected tribune of the people.

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:22.360
But I think he was all for
fairness and he's usually
right. That's the thing.

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:25.400
Justifiably, he was
furious about, you know,

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:27.720
the Full Tilt scandal.

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:30.280
He might have gone a little
bit too far in some cases

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:33.040
with the righteous
indignation card.

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:37.680
I think there was one instance
where he was suggesting
somebody's legs got broken.

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:40.720
I think that might have been
going a little bit too far.

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:44.520
Er, I think he would probably
admit that himself maybe.

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:47.400
I've come to realise that those
comments are pretty harsh.

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:51.040
And I've had some time
to think about what I'd said.

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:54.160
Yeah, I think they're
absolutely appropriate.

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:56.840
I do, Howard. If you're
listening and watching us, I do.

01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:59.320
I don't think I would have
any problem with somebody

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:02.640
who had $15,000 of their
hard-earned money on your site

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:06.440
come up to you and bash you
in the nuts with a baseball bat.

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:11.520
Howard, Ray and Chris, you
asked the poker world to...

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:14.240
you know, accept your brand
and come play at your site.

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:18.880
Come play and chat with the
pros. Come chat with the pros.

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:24.960
There's a lot of people
that would like to chat
with you right now.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.360
But all of a sudden...zip.

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:29.960
I waited a long time. I really
didn't say anything for months,

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.880
hoping that you guys could
rectify the situation,
but you are scumbags!

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:39.080
Absolute, flat-out scumbags
for ignoring the poker world
that you fleeced

01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:42.400
for as much money as you did
and now you have nothing to say?

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:45.160
Nothing to say?!
Are you freaking serious?

01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:49.320
There's not a lawyer in the
world that can force you
to keep as quiet as you have.

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:53.680
And it's shameful, disgusting
and you deserve a smack in
the face for what you've done.

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:55.840
You have no respect
for our community.

01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:58.600
You should be shunned and
ostracised from our
community forever

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:01.840
for the lack of respect you've
shown us by not giving us
a single statement.

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:05.280
Something to the effect of,
"Wow, I'm so sorry about
what happened.

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:07.880
I'll do everything in my power
to rectify the situation."
Nothing.

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:10.480
Instead, you hide out like
a shameful little weasel.

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:15.080
Shameful little weasel that
you are. All three of you
disgust me. Bluuh!

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:18.560
[John] If everybody spoke up
the same way that he does,

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:21.200
then it would be different.

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:24.680
You know, at the time, he was
right about what he was saying
about certain people.

01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:29.000
Erm, but maybe stretched it
a little bit, I don't know.

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:33.920
I have to be true to myself
and part of that means

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:35.560
I have an opinion and
I'm gonna share it.

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:37.200
I realise, wholeheartedly,

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:39.600
that when I take stand
on something,

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:42.000
it's gonna piss some people off
and other people may
applaud me for it.

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:44.800
That's just gonna happen when
you're as outspoken as I am.

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:49.320
But I'd rather be that kind of
person than someone who has
no opinion at all.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.200
[Antonio] I didn't want to be
involved in the politics
of poker.

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:57.560
Daniel is much different.

01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:00.920
He voices his opinion.
He knows everything that's
going on in poker.

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:04.280
[Daniel] I've been at odds
with the Tournament
Directors Association,

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:07.200
in terms of the way that they're
implementing new rule changes

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:10.520
and giving themselves
some self-appointed power,
if you will.

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:13.600
And really kind of blurring
the lines of their role.

01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:15.880
A rule that makes
your job easier

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:18.560
doesn't, necessarily,
make it a better rule.

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:21.320
A rule the players appreciate,
that the players want,

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:25.040
the players prefer, is
the rule that should trump

01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:28.600
the idea that it might make
your job just a little
bit easier.

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:31.000
<i>I see that the role
of the tournament director...</i>

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:33.560
as customer service
because it's the players

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:37.200
that are paying the entry fees
to play in the tournaments
that pay your salary.

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:39.520
So it's not a prison guard,
prisoner mentality.

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:43.040
And I saw a shift,
where a lot of rules
that were being implemented

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:45.480
that were not recreational
player friendly.

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:48.520
So I spoke out, you know,
and a lot of the time
they don't like that.

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:51.880
And I appreciate what they do.
But if I don't agree with
something, I'm gonna say it,

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:55.840
regardless of the backlash
that it may create, even if
I'm the only one saying it.

01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:00.200
[Phil] Dan's very opinionated.
That's what we love about him.

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:03.520
I mean, he's gonna give you
his opinion Whether you
like it or not.

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:05.400
And I wish more people
were like that.

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:07.960
At least with Daniel, you
always know where you stand.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.360
If he doesn't like you, he'll
tell you he doesn't like you.

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:12.560
There's nothing phoney
about him.

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:15.240
And, er...that's just
the way it is.

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:18.360
Sometimes he gets
people's backs up.

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:21.680
But he always presents
a strong argument.

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:24.720
And he's also not petty.

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:27.960
And I have, occasionally, seen
him even change his position

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.600
when listening to
the opinions of others.

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:34.640
But, yes, it does sometimes
make him a target for people,

01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:37.480
who sometimes feel
that it's not his place.

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:40.600
But he's an individual
and that's who he is.

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:42.800
It's very much part
of his personality

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:47.280
and, actually, I don't think
he would be who he is now

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:49.360
had he played it safe.

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:52.920
Had he stayed mute on
so many things over the years.

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:56.200
I often stick my nose
where it doesn't belong.

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:59.600
I often have an opinion
that is strong

01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:02.480
and righteous, if you will,
and I'm wrong...

01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:04.440
You know. I don't know.
I can't remember.

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:06.480
But I'm sure I have
been wrong once or twice.

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:10.920
And I just hope that
you all understand that

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:14.400
I appreciate this award
so much

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:16.720
because it's a validation of

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:20.960
me sticking for what I believe
is truly best for this
poker community.

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:28.080
[John] Recently, I've seen
a different side to him.

01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:30.280
He's listening and thinking
about others.

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:36.280
[Mike] My brother changed
after my mother's passing.

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:38.320
It made him...

01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:40.560
look at...

01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:42.360
the world a little different.

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.280
Where, you know what?

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:48.480
That support has gone.

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:53.520
You know, Daniel's mother
was fine.

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:56.640
And then, she wasn't.
It was like that.

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:03.320
[Mike] My mother suffered
from heart issues.

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:06.240
One day, she had a minor stroke.

01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:08.520
She had to be
hospitalised for it.

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:12.040
I had to bring my mother
back home to Toronto.

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:18.240
[Daniel] And she recovered,
but the doctors explained
to us that...

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:21.000
they need to go back in cos,
if they don't, she may
have a bigger stroke.

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:24.920
He warned us it would be
a high-risk surgery

01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:26.960
and I didn't really hear that.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.040
I'm like, "Okay,
I'm sure it will be fine.

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:30.920
Surgery, doctors, they
know what they're doing."

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:33.000
Well, it wasn't good because

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:35.000
that was the last I ever
spoke to my mother,

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:38.400
or the last she could ever speak
to me because during the, erm,

01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:40.960
surgery, when they were trying
to get the blood clots out,

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.680
she had a massive stroke,
where she was fully paralysed
on her left side.

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:48.400
Never spoke another word.
Was in a coma for quite a while.

01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:51.360
And, er...
So for seven, eight months,

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:54.160
she led a "life" where
she was bed-ridden

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:57.000
and couldn't speak, couldn't
drink water, couldn't eat food.

01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:59.200
Just absolutely miserable, like.

01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:04.120
My brother was at the hospital
every day.

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:07.480
I was living in Vegas
and I would go visit.

01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:10.600
[Mike] There was
one day I remember.

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:13.640
I told her, "I have
a surprise for you."

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:16.880
But she couldn't speak, but...

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:19.480
through eye contact we knew
what was going on.

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:23.200
We could always communicate
just by the way
we looked at each other.

01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:26.520
"I have a surprise for you."

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:28.400
She looked at me
and she's like...

01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:33.000
I said, "Daniel's here."
And Daniel walked in.

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:36.520
And she's like this.
Her eyes lit up.

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:39.440
So even at that point in time,

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:43.280
having Daniel there just
brightened up her world.
It was amazing.

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:48.840
It was hard for him to see
his mother in that condition.

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:51.720
It took a lot out of my brother,

01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:53.880
because the demands put on him.

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:57.760
At that time,
his career was rising.

01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:01.040
He always had to keep up
with appearances.

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:04.440
It took a big toll, even with
his performance at the table.

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:07.280
Like, you could see
things weren't right.

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:08.800
And...

01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:14.120
I don't think...
he was able to deal with it.

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:17.560
I let him know that it's okay.

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:21.040
I got your back.
We'll deal with this together.

01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:23.800
And my mum hung in there
for a long time.

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:26.240
And, ultimately,
the doctors said,

01:08:26.279 --> 01:08:29.240
"She's getting better.
It looks like she might
get out next week,

01:08:29.279 --> 01:08:31.960
and we'll put her
in some rehab."

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.080
And then my brother, he has
an annual football game
that he goes to.

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:38.520
So, that weekend, he went
to the football game.

01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:40.800
Cos he'd been to the hospital
every single day.

01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:43.960
I flew in to Toronto.
I was going to see my mother
the next morning.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.600
That's the night she died.
It's amazing.

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:49.399
Like, as soon as my brother
was gone and I wasn't there,

01:08:49.439 --> 01:08:53.760
I felt like she finally felt
the peace where she's like, "I
don't have to hang on any more."

01:08:57.240 --> 01:08:59.520
After the funeral, er...

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:02.720
I drove my brother
to the airport.

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:05.920
And, er, he went back to Vegas.

01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:08.279
Back home.

01:09:08.319 --> 01:09:10.960
While he's walking away,

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.080
I looked at him and
I said to myself...

01:09:16.359 --> 01:09:19.120
"He's on his own."

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:21.920
But I knew Vegas was his home.

01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:25.120
He'd established himself
there and...

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:27.600
he had a lot of friends
and a lot of support.

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:30.279
I knew he was gonna be okay.

01:09:30.319 --> 01:09:32.600
Vegas is his home.

01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:39.200
[Daniel] It wasn't till,
you know, a few weeks later,

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:41.600
when something funny happened
and I wanted to tell my mum,

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:46.800
and realised that I couldn't,
cos she's not there any more.

01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:50.680
That's when it all
kind of hit me.

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:57.280
[Jennifer] It did change him
a little bit.

01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:01.000
He became a little bit more

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:04.040
focused on the things he wanted

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:06.600
and went after them
a little bit more.

01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:09.280
Became a little bit more
ambitious and...

01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:12.560
a little bit more
caring and loving,

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:16.440
because he did realise that,

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:20.240
you know, you do die
and life is short.

01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:27.400
[Mike] The way we are,
the way we behave and act,
the way we treat others.

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:30.840
You know, the legacy lives on.

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:35.760
Seeing my brother,
I see my father,

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:39.000
as he's a spitting image
of him, so...

01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:41.280
just getting down or whatever,

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:43.840
I would call him, he'd always
have a funny story

01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:48.080
or act out and make me laugh
and remember the good times.

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:50.800
[Daniel] The only regret I have

01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:53.600
or sadness, outside
of a perfect childhood,

01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:55.920
is the fact that my parents
weren't around longer.

01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:01.480
[Mike] In my household,
growing up, it was always

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:03.960
boisterous, it was always fun,

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.200
fun-loving, always
music being played.

01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:08.920
Dancing and singing.

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:11.440
Food and drink.

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:15.640
And I think maybe we've become
like our parents a little bit.

01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:26.280
[Daniel] I'd already started
down a path of self-discovery
and introspection

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:30.560
when my agent, Brian, did this
course on emotional
intelligence,

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:34.360
here in Vegas, called
ChoiceCenter, and he said,
"Dude, you gotta try it."

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:37.720
I went there. The first couple
of days I'm like, "Huh?
This seems silly," you know?

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:41.000
It's not really for me, but,
ultimately, I learned a lot

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:45.160
about what's held me back
from being the best version
of myself.

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:49.640
I had sort of an experience
with a girl who I was
absolutely in love with.

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:53.440
The signs were there, right? I
knew there were things going on.

01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:55.840
And I knew all this stuff,
but I chose to stay in that.

01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:58.480
And I hadn't realised how
much that affected me,

01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:02.240
that failed relationship with
the girl, in all areas
of my life.

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:04.880
It didn't just hurt
my confidence there,

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:06.520
but it hurt my confidence
at the poker table.

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:10.240
So when I read on the internet
people saying,

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:12.760
"He's over the hill.
All these young kids are
better than him,"

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:16.320
I started to believe it.
"Yeah, maybe they're right.
Maybe I can't compete any more."

01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:21.240
So, through the course, I tapped
into that confidence again.

01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:24.440
Like, "Wait a minute,
I've done it before.
I can totally do it again."

01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:27.960
I told my story
of a broken heart, right?

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.280
So I told it,
as me being the victim.

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:33.640
And then I retold the story
again, where I'm 100%
responsible.

01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:36.040
It was one of the most freeing
experiences I've ever had.

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:38.880
Cos I realised,
I chose all that.

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:42.280
So it gave me the power back.

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:45.600
I had a coach and I had a plan
of how I was going to do it.

01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:47.520
Part of it was watching video.

01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:49.600
I would watch
the high roller events.

01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:52.000
I would talk poker with friends.
I would practise poker.

01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:54.080
I was re-studying the game.

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:56.320
The biggest thing
I've been able to shift

01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:58.800
is when I'm in a bad place,
cos I'm still there.

01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:01.320
I still get pissed off,
I still get angry and annoyed.

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:04.320
I still get arrogant, I still
get condescending to people.

01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:07.880
What I'm able to do is recognise
it much quicker and then
I can shift out of it.

01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:10.440
So, instead of being in that
place for a week or two weeks,

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:12.760
and being like, "Poor me,
look at me." No, no, no.

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:15.000
"How am I responsible for
creating this situation?

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:17.440
How am I being in this moment?
How do I want to be?

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:19.880
How am I going to shift
into that?" I do that much
quicker than in the past.

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:23.760
If I make a mistake or I
do something wrong, I'll
acknowledge it, right?

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:26.200
And then commit to what I'm
going to do differently
about it.

01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:31.080
I look back on all the things
I've created in my life

01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:33.680
and I believe that I'm 100%
responsible for all of it,

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:35.800
in the sense of, like,
the good and the bad.

01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:37.840
Cos I'm responsible for
all the decisions I make.

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:40.560
Sure, you could use the fact
I was born into good parents

01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:43.320
and I didn't choose that.
I was lucky, absolutely,

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:46.040
and I don't take that for
granted, but from that point,

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:48.960
erm, I believe that people
are right where they are at

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.400
based on decisions that
they've made in their life,
both good and bad.

01:13:55.440 --> 01:14:00.200
[John] He's a much more relaxed
and much calmer person.

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:03.520
So he's moving slowly
towards humility,

01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:06.080
like we all try to do.

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:11.840
Daniel and I, we were always
cordial but it was never
a friendship.

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:15.600
And I can say that in the last
couple of years that has
completely shifted.

01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:18.880
I think that we've
both grown up a lot and,

01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:21.960
you know, now I consider
Daniel a true friend.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.040
He's a really solid human.
He has a big heart.

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:29.360
[Mike] I think he's able
to talk to people.

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:31.000
And listen.

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:35.680
As opposed to always
wanting to be heard.

01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:38.160
He's able to listen now.

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:40.160
And...

01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:43.000
I find our relationship
strengthened.

01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:45.400
Cos now he's attentive.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.720
I see him focused and driven.

01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:52.600
Wanting to succeed again.

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:56.600
[Daniel] I'm a big believer
in the idea that

01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:59.600
everything starts
with a thought, right?

01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:03.880
A belief that you can or
can't do something. Call it
clear intention, if you will.

01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:06.360
So I'm very, very clear
on, "What is it that
I want to achieve?"

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:09.560
And if I believe that I can,
I'm going to put in the work.

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:13.920
So this is my vision board
or vision wall, if you will.

01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:17.280
Essentially, the idea behind
this is you put things out
there that you want to achieve.

01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:20.960
And it's a constant
reminder daily.

01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:25.720
I have a personality type
that's very goal driven.

01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:29.840
I'm self-motivated. I put more
pressure on myself than
anyone else can.

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:34.200
In fact, sometimes when people
doubt me, it fuels me.

01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:38.880
When I hear people saying I'm
done, I can't do this or that,

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:42.560
I'm like, "Oh, really? Oh, man,
do I want to shove this
in your face!"

01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:46.480
That's what drives me.

01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:54.840
In poker, each year I try to
come up with new ways
to motivate myself.

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:58.560
Right now, the one area I feel
like I'm falling behind
or I need to address

01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:01.240
is the number of bracelets
I've got. I've got six.

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:03.680
And I feel like I should have
nine or ten right now.

01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:06.280
So the next few years, I'm
going to push really hard

01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:10.720
towards, you know, getting
back into the race for the
all-time lead in bracelets.

01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:15.600
Also I've been close to winning
an EPT title twice.

01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:17.960
The Grand Final,

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.600
which is, you know,
the crown jewel, is one
where I came fourth in.

01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:25.080
And I had a fourth before that.

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:31.400
EPTs are considered
very prestigious.

01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:33.640
There's a lot
of tough competition.

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:38.120
So having that on my resume
is something that
does matter to me.

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:40.840
[Mike] I think my brother

01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:43.280
just wants to succeed
at what he loves to do,

01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:47.800
whether it be soccer,
playing sports...

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:51.800
..and poker.

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:55.360
It's not about the money.
It's about that bracelet.

01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:58.160
That Holy Grail,
getting to the next level.

01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:01.680
And...

01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:04.320
my brother's determined.

01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:07.480
No matter what,
he will get what he wants.

01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:13.400
I've got a broader scope of what
I want to create in my life.

01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:17.720
I am focusing on what ways I can
do the more mainstream stuff
and things outside of poker.

01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:19.920
I'm always going to be a poker
player and care about that,

01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:23.480
but I have a lot of goals
that are in different verticals.

01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:27.280
I'm very, very excited
about hockey

01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:28.960
possibly coming to Las Vegas

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.360
and being a part of
the ownership group.

01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:34.040
I'm hoping to be
a minority owner as well.

01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:37.920
I mean, as a kid, growing up
in Toronto, the idea of owning
a piece of an NHL team.

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:40.520
Even if it's not gonna
make me a bunch of money,

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:42.640
it's more of a dream come true.

01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:48.520
It's really about expanding.
Using the platform that
I've been given

01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:52.000
to make a difference
in the world, in various ways.

01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:56.720
One of the events that I'm
working on now is one with
St Jude's Children's Hospital.

01:17:56.760 --> 01:18:01.560
And I'm really inspired by
what the Germans are doing,
raising for effective giving,

01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:05.160
which is, essentially, asking
the poker world to make
a difference.

01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:07.440
A lot of people are conflicted.
If you play poker for a living,

01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:10.320
what do you contribute to
society? You take money
from other people.

01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:14.480
What are you gonna do to live
a balanced life and make
sure you're contributing?

01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:16.960
And one of the ways you can do
that is by giving effectively.

01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:21.920
[Mike] Growing up,
he always wanted
to hustle, hustle, hustle

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:23.960
and get to the next level.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.480
Now, I think he's
able to reflect,

01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:29.600
look back,

01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:33.320
and start to give
to his community.

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:40.600
And now, I know just recently,
he went to California,

01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:44.240
to talk to people in government

01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:48.040
and help get poker
back in the United States.

01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:53.600
So I think he's become
a poker ambassador.

01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:55.360
He's the voice of poker.

01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:01.280
[Jason] When you think
of poker, most people think
of Daniel Negreanu.

01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:03.560
Somebody that I look up to.

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:07.840
Basically, if he says something,
you know, that's what
he believes.

01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:11.360
That's something that,
you know, I try to

01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:12.960
do in my own life.

01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:16.760
[John] I don't think
you can actually measure

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:20.440
the contribution that
Daniel's made to the game.

01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:25.840
He's had a massive influence.
I'm sure he would have been
responsible for a lot of people

01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:27.920
learning the game.

01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:32.560
[Jennifer] He's written columns.
He's done interviews.

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:36.000
He teaches strategy. He's
always there to help people.

01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:39.960
[Maria] I see a lot of people
go to him for advice

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.880
and he's never turned anybody
down when they needed him.

01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:48.920
It's actually amazing to see
how many people who actually
don't even play poker

01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:52.400
or necessarily like poker,
but Daniel's transcended that.

01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:56.800
[Antonio] He's fun to watch.
When he's on TV, you want
to watch him,

01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:59.280
cos he takes you through
the process of the hand,

01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:01.800
he calls it out right,
most of the time,

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:04.680
and that's what people
want to watch.

01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:08.240
[James] Most people look up to
Daniel in one way or another,

01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:12.480
for his ability as a poker
player but also his ability
to market the game.

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:17.280
At the American Poker Wars,
the first-ever ceremony,
he was named poker ambassador,

01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:20.800
and he had no competition
because, throughout the years,

01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:26.280
he has completely understood
his role, understood the need
to bring people into poker,

01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:31.200
to make it appealing and really
publicise what great fun it is

01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:33.520
and what a great experience
it is for everyone.

01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:35.640
And he's excellent at it.

01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:37.960
[Daniel] Being an ambassador
is a role I fell into

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.080
that I feel very comfortable
in for the game.

01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:42.600
And, er...

01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:44.800
It's just I'm
compelled to do it.

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:47.480
I don't feel as though
it's an obligation at all.

01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:49.480
It just feels like
I love this game.

01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:52.160
I want to see it grow and
I want to see people enjoy it

01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:54.320
and have fun with it,
like they always have.

01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:57.000
And if I can contribute
to that, I'm going to.

01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:06.840
[Phil] I can't think of too
many people who've done more
for the game of poker today.

01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:11.920
No one deserved it more than
Daniel getting in the
Poker Hall of Fame.

01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:13.320
Period.

01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:21.880
[Daniel] <i> Well, to be inducted</i>
<i>at 40 years old,</i>

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:23.640
<i>first-time balloter,
alongside Chip Reese,</i>

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:26.440
<i>who I admired as a player
and as a person,</i>

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:29.240
<i>is certainly an honour.</i>

01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:30.760
Hey, my man.

01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:32.640
<i>It's recognition
from your peers.</i>

01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:34.800
<i>From the living members
of the Hall of Fame,</i>

01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:38.800
<i>who are saying that, you know,
you're part of the club now.</i>

01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:42.040
Most of the youngsters,
they don't meet the criteria.

01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:44.920
But Daniel, he crushes it.

01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:47.800
Daniel deserves to be
in the Hall of Fame.

01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:50.240
He's earned a spot. He's
been an amazing ambassador.

01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:54.760
But he's made it because
of the player that he is.

01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:59.960
I'd like to welcome Daniel
into the 2014 Poker
Hall of Fame.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.720
[cheering and applause]

01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:12.360
I just wanted to start
by saying, this is
an absolute honour

01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:14.600
and thanks for being here.

01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:17.720
[laughter]

01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:24.560
Did anyone buy that, right,
that that's all I had to say?

01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:27.200
No, I've got a lot to say.

01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:30.040
When I started playing poker
as a teenager,

01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:32.600
I remember watching the World
Series of Poker on ESPN

01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:35.680
and seeing guys like Phil
Hellmuth and Johnny Chan
battling it out

01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:38.640
and thought, you know, "I just
want to be a part of that."

01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:41.360
I decided I wanted to make
my mother proud of what I do,

01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:43.680
because, when I started
in the late '90s,

01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:46.160
being a professional poker
player wasn't something
to be proud of.

01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:50.320
After all, what do we
contribute to society?
What do we give back?

01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:53.800
I've been in the game for over,
I don't know, about
20 years now,

01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:57.000
and I plan to be in this game
another 40 years.

01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:01.120
I want to be part
of the conversation,
a big part of the conversation,

01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:04.880
changing the definition
of what a poker player is
and what we do.

01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:07.440
Thinking of my parents, who,
if they were here today,

01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:11.840
I know would be proud.
My mother would have
cooked all the food.

01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:15.440
Cos that's what she does,
and my dad would make sure
all your glasses were full,

01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:17.600
cos that's just the kind
of people they were.

01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:20.320
I had parents who just
loved me unconditionally.

01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:22.760
And I'm super thankful
and grateful for that.

01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:26.120
For me, it was never
about the money.

01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:30.280
My first trip to Las Vegas
was here, actually in Binion's
Horseshoe, downstairs.

01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:32.440
I brought a $3,000 bankroll.

01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:34.880
And about 24 hours later,

01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:37.200
I had a lot of free time
on my hands.

01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:40.120
- [laughter]
- I was like watching
the room going, "Oh, okay."

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:43.440
So I learned my lesson.
But really the reason
I got into poker

01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:45.600
was cos it was a passion for me.

01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:48.400
I believe that whatever it is
you choose to do in your life,

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:50.960
being passionate
is a prerequisite.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.560
Wanting it for fame and fortune
will not get you there.

01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:56.960
Unless you have a passion
for it and it's something
you truly love, the craft,

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:00.920
then you're very unlikely
to be successful.

01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:04.720
Integrity is a word that
really means a lot to me.

01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:09.560
I know probably in the last
15, 20 years, I've pissed off
a lot of people.

01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:11.960
Some of you are in this room,
right? [he laughs]

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.360
- [laughter]
- But I'm going
to have an opinion.

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:17.240
If I stand alone...
I have stood alone

01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:19.880
many times on
controversial issues.

01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:23.320
But I'm always telling you
exactly what I feel

01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:26.280
and like what I really
truly believe.

01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:29.680
It reminds me of an Aristotle
quote, actually.

01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:34.200
I've never really been afraid
of controversy and this
one quote sums it up.

01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:37.800
It says "to avoid criticism
say nothing,

01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:41.400
do nothing and be nothing".

01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:44.720
And that's not the way
I live my life.

01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:46.600
In this 20-year journey,

01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:49.000
one of my goals was
to make my mother proud.

01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:51.200
And I hope that in doing so...

01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:55.640
..I've inspired others
to dream bigger,

01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:57.920
live a bigger life

01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:01.200
and also show the world
that just because we play
poker for a living

01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:03.920
doesn't mean that we can't
contribute to society.

01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:07.680
So I want to thank everyone
here, all the living members
who voted me in.

01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:11.440
I'm honoured,
I'm thankful and, erm...

01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:13.560
That's all I got.

01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:16.600
[applause]

01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:22.640
We always knew that the
potential was just no ceiling,

01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:25.400
up to the sky.

01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:29.200
The field that he's in has a lot
to do with your character
and who you are.

01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:33.120
It's not only about reading
cards and math and stats,
which he's also really good at,

01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:35.840
but it's your personality.

01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:39.240
If your tombstone says
"great poker player",

01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:42.240
that seems like
an unfulfilled life.

01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:45.640
I'd rather be seen as someone
who was inspiring to others.

01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:49.320
Someone who gave back,
a good friend, a good brother.

01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:51.960
A good son.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.120
[Mike] I think both my parents
are looking down on us

01:25:56.160 --> 01:25:58.280
and saying, "You know what?

01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:01.360
He did what he said
he was going to do."

01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:05.400
Having my parents support him,

01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:09.320
his endeavours, I think,
means the world to my brother.

01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:12.240
Everything about the way that
I see the world I owe them,

01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:14.720
because they taught me
that anything is possible.

01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:17.520
They taught me that, you know,
that giving is important.

01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:21.040
You know, they taught me that
motivation and drive and
having fun,

01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:24.400
and being hospitable,
like that's really the core,

01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:27.480
the things that I still,
to this day, view as important.

01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:29.520
And it comes from them.
