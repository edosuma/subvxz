00:02.068 --> 00:05.334
TORRID:
I conjure and constrain thee!

00:05.405 --> 00:08.000
Demons of the equal sphere!

00:08.074 --> 00:10.168
Creatures of the second world!

00:10.243 --> 00:13.441
Enter my circle
and do my will!

00:13.513 --> 00:15.744
For I command this!

00:15.815 --> 00:18.046
Torrid's a dick.
Who does that?

00:18.118 --> 00:20.019
Who opens up hell?
Honestly.

00:20.086 --> 00:22.112
If Torrid gets the portal open
we're done for.

00:22.188 --> 00:24.089
Once the second world
comes through,

00:24.157 --> 00:25.887
we haven't the power
to stop them.

00:25.959 --> 00:27.552
I gotta be honest
I'm scared.

00:27.627 --> 00:28.925
I'm at like a nine scared.

00:28.995 --> 00:30.224
Nine point three, maybe.

00:30.296 --> 00:31.696
We should all be at ten!

00:31.765 --> 00:33.666
There isn't a sorcerer alive
who has the ability

00:33.733 --> 00:35.668
to fight the denizens
of the second world...

00:35.735 --> 00:36.828
I'm a ten.

00:36.903 --> 00:38.496
If Orpheus is going
Bo Derrick,

00:38.571 --> 00:39.766
then I'm pushing it up
to eight.

00:39.839 --> 00:41.137
I admire your bravery.

00:41.207 --> 00:43.301
Now are you ready to wage
our final battle?

00:43.376 --> 00:44.674
What? Hell no.

00:44.744 --> 00:46.076
I have one more thing
to try.

00:46.146 --> 00:47.614
Stop being a pud!

00:47.680 --> 00:49.012
Knock it off, ya dingbat!

00:49.082 --> 00:51.916
Nobody wants you to open
a door to hell!

00:57.824 --> 01:00.157
TORRID:
Nooo! I command thee!

01:00.226 --> 01:02.320
Nooo! Please!

01:02.395 --> 01:03.658
Aaaahhhh!

01:03.730 --> 01:05.892
Something just came out
of the vortex

01:05.965 --> 01:07.092
and killed Torrid.

01:07.167 --> 01:09.500
So... that happened.

01:09.569 --> 01:11.538
The time is now!
Triad, join me!

01:11.604 --> 01:13.596
For I am Dr. Orpheus!

01:13.673 --> 01:16.666
Master of mysticism!

01:16.743 --> 01:18.871
I don't want to do that
introducing ourselves bit.

01:18.945 --> 01:20.174
It's goofy.

01:20.246 --> 01:21.908
Let's not die being goofy.

01:21.981 --> 01:23.074
I'm with Al.

01:23.149 --> 01:24.674
Maybe we could sing
a Stevie Wonder song together?

01:24.751 --> 01:26.185
Yeah, that's not
much better.

01:26.252 --> 01:28.084
Triad! Attack!

01:39.833 --> 01:41.802
I'm pretty sure that
all my ribs are broken!

01:41.868 --> 01:42.927
Can someone help!?

01:43.002 --> 01:47.633
Haristum, lend me your
power of fire!

01:49.709 --> 01:51.974
Nice!
You made it bigger.

01:52.045 --> 01:53.707
Forget him. Shoot me!

01:53.780 --> 01:56.079
Kill me!

01:56.149 --> 01:58.880
[ horse neighs ]

02:04.224 --> 02:08.354
OUTRIDER:
Back to the depth
from which you came!

[groans ]

02:19.005 --> 02:20.906
He was just dead.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.966
He'll be fine.

02:23.042 --> 02:24.635
Till the next time,
gentlemen.

02:24.711 --> 02:26.942
Black lightning!
Ride!

02:27.013 --> 02:28.948
Call me!

02:29.015 --> 02:30.483
"Call me"?
What was that?

02:30.550 --> 02:32.712
Instinct?
He's adorable. I panicked.

02:32.785 --> 02:34.117
Who was that guy?

02:34.187 --> 02:36.418
That guy was
The Outrider.

02:36.489 --> 02:38.253
Oh my god!

02:38.324 --> 02:39.690
That's the guy who --

02:39.759 --> 02:43.491
Stole my wife!

02:49.002 --> 02:50.937
HANK:
Did Uncle Gentleman
die again?

02:51.004 --> 02:52.131
What's with the suit?

02:52.205 --> 02:53.901
Nothing.
Is it illegal to look good?

02:53.973 --> 02:55.635
Yeah, in this house
it kinda is.

02:55.708 --> 02:57.506
You think I like
wearing prison pajamas

02:57.577 --> 02:59.478
with position locators
sewn into them?

02:59.546 --> 03:00.639
Yes.

03:00.713 --> 03:02.011
That's because
I look good in them!

03:02.081 --> 03:03.447
But if you are
gonna wear that,

03:03.516 --> 03:06.315
there is a little appointment
I'd like to make to mine.

03:06.386 --> 03:08.184
So this has nothing to do
with Triana and her father

03:08.254 --> 03:10.052
piling up crap
on our front lawn?

03:10.123 --> 03:12.752
Oh, is she out there too?

03:12.825 --> 03:14.088
Dean. Deano.

03:14.160 --> 03:15.321
When are you just
gonna admit it?

03:15.395 --> 03:16.226
Admit what?

03:16.296 --> 03:18.891
Admit that I can still
rock a kerchief!

03:35.582 --> 03:37.210
For one, you killed
Matthew Lesko.

03:37.283 --> 03:39.718
That was-- well he was wearing
punctuation on his suit!

03:39.786 --> 03:41.414
That's a total bad-guy suit!

03:41.487 --> 03:43.649
He helps people get free money
from the government.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.191
That is a good guy.

03:45.258 --> 03:46.453
It's reflected

I have no magic powers!

03:49.362 --> 03:51.194
The second someone uses magic,
I get killed.

03:51.264 --> 03:52.664
That was humbling
for all of us.

03:52.732 --> 03:54.860
It was like he pulled down our
pants and powdered our bottoms.

03:54.934 --> 03:56.869
Humiliating.
He brought me back to life.

03:56.936 --> 03:58.632
I'm serious.
I saw my dead mom.

03:58.705 --> 04:01.766
And she was all "Jefferson,
head into the light,"

04:01.841 --> 04:03.605
and I was like "I can't Mom,
I have to stay here

04:03.676 --> 04:05.872
and get my ass kicked
by a guy made outta fire."

04:05.945 --> 04:07.937
Thank God that Outrider guy
was there.

04:08.014 --> 04:09.380
Don't let Orpheus
hear that.

04:09.449 --> 04:12.112
If you'd a' told me you were
gonna have a yard-sale,

04:12.185 --> 04:13.778
I would've brought Dean's
ever growing collection

04:13.853 --> 04:15.185
of apple head dolls.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.224
It's not a yard-sale.

04:17.290 --> 04:21.250
This configuration is a portal
to the second world!

04:21.327 --> 04:22.886
DOC:
Sure it is.

04:22.962 --> 04:23.793
DEAN:
I don't get it.

04:23.863 --> 04:25.354
It's an ego thing.

04:25.431 --> 04:27.457
My dad thinks that
if The Outrider can travel
through hell,

04:27.533 --> 04:28.967
he can too.

04:29.035 --> 04:30.594
Isn't The Outrider married
to your mom?

04:30.670 --> 04:31.899
Yeah.
I only met him once.

04:31.971 --> 04:32.802
I was eight.

04:32.872 --> 04:34.932
If I was your dad,
and you were your mom,

04:35.008 --> 04:36.977
and the you that wasn't your mom
was another girl,

04:37.043 --> 04:39.410
I would never let anyone
take the you-mom.

04:39.479 --> 04:40.970
That would be really
sweet...

04:41.047 --> 04:42.310
if it wasn't so confusing.

04:42.382 --> 04:43.680
I'm sorry.

04:43.750 --> 04:44.911
Ooh!
Can I pet your pussy?

04:44.984 --> 04:47.078
There is no irony
in that, is there?

04:47.153 --> 04:49.145
It's soft.

04:49.222 --> 04:51.248
Your pussy hates me.

04:51.324 --> 04:53.589
Did Orpheus open
the ridiculous pile of crap

04:53.660 --> 04:54.821
he calls
a portal yet?

04:54.894 --> 04:55.918
Is that what that is?

04:55.995 --> 04:57.657
Oh, hey.
Can I ask you something?

04:57.730 --> 04:59.392
You're gay right?

04:59.499 --> 05:01.161
- Yeah.
- What's it look like?

05:01.234 --> 05:03.760
Does it look real,
or all Frankenstein?

05:03.836 --> 05:05.429
- Hank?
- Your dingus. Does it look real?

05:05.505 --> 05:07.201
What is Kid Crazy
talking about?

05:07.273 --> 05:08.639
He thinks you're
transgender.

05:08.708 --> 05:10.768
Hank, it looks real
because it is real.

05:10.843 --> 05:11.742
I'm gay.

05:11.811 --> 05:13.211
That doesn't mean
I was born a woman.

05:13.279 --> 05:15.612
I have a regular "dingus"
as you say.

05:15.682 --> 05:17.651
Hank, aren't you just a little
ashamed of your ignorance?

05:17.717 --> 05:18.946
Like just a little?

05:19.018 --> 05:20.179
Yeah.
Constantly.

05:20.253 --> 05:22.347
O thou great
and powerful Amaymon,

05:22.422 --> 05:24.584
I invoke and command thee

05:24.657 --> 05:29.652
to open these gates
to the second world!

05:29.729 --> 05:31.561
Maybe you forgot
to plug it in.

05:31.631 --> 05:32.599
Something has come through!

05:34.634 --> 05:35.761
Oh come on!

05:35.835 --> 05:37.428
And did you
have to do that?

05:37.503 --> 05:39.472
Is the whole of this world
your personal bathroom?

05:39.539 --> 05:41.235
It was Simba...

05:41.307 --> 05:43.299
She's okay.
It's my cat.

05:43.376 --> 05:44.935
She's from this world.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.309
What was supposed
to happen?

05:46.379 --> 05:47.472
My mom calls his cell phone

05:47.547 --> 05:49.038
and tells him he's a better
kisser, I think.

05:49.115 --> 05:51.277
Did the portal work?
Is he in hell yet?

05:51.351 --> 05:53.013
Oooh, he's in hell alright.

05:53.086 --> 05:55.715
Master? Master?

05:55.788 --> 05:56.619
Master?

05:58.925 --> 06:01.121
Tatjana?

06:01.194 --> 06:02.355
What are you doing here?

06:02.428 --> 06:04.363
I was just sitting here
thinking how glad I am

06:04.430 --> 06:05.625
that I left you
for The Outrider.

06:05.698 --> 06:07.826
And how he does that thing
you used to do with your mouth,

06:07.900 --> 06:10.199
but better because he can hold
his breath longer.

06:10.269 --> 06:13.364
Oh, it is you,
my master.

06:13.439 --> 06:14.600
Duh, Orpheus.

06:14.674 --> 06:16.074
Now what's all this
crybaby crap about?

06:16.142 --> 06:17.371
Aren't you used
to The Outrider

06:17.443 --> 06:18.706
making you look
like a schnook by now?

06:18.778 --> 06:21.043
He came out of a portal
to the second world!

06:21.114 --> 06:22.707
I have been training
my whole life

06:22.782 --> 06:24.842
just to perceive that
there is a second world,

06:24.917 --> 06:26.476
and he can move
between them?

06:26.552 --> 06:28.544
Tell me, master.
How can this be?

06:28.621 --> 06:30.453
MASTER:
The love of a good woman
can do wonders, Orpheus.

06:30.523 --> 06:32.082
I mean look at me.

06:32.158 --> 06:33.456
These are natural C cups.

06:33.526 --> 06:34.619
Aren't they beautiful?

06:34.694 --> 06:36.822
I mean, you could bounce
a penis off these.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.990
I doubt my ex-wife's
breasts are the answer.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.055
It doesn't stop there.

06:40.133 --> 06:42.193
I am sitting on what is easily
the ass of a teenager.

06:42.268 --> 06:44.237
What, does she do --
pilates or something?

06:44.303 --> 06:45.430
You could rest
a coffee mug on it.

06:45.505 --> 06:47.098
Really?
She's almost 40 by now.

06:47.173 --> 06:48.471
Tell it to the heinie,
Orpheus,

06:48.541 --> 06:50.237
'cause it still thinks
it's 1992.

06:50.309 --> 06:52.141
[sighs ]

06:52.211 --> 06:53.042
What ya doing?

06:53.112 --> 06:54.080
Nothing.

06:54.147 --> 06:55.479
Nothing because our dad,

06:55.548 --> 06:57.278
the globe-trotting
super action scientist

06:57.350 --> 06:59.649
is on the couch,
"resting his eyes."

06:59.719 --> 07:01.017
This blows!

07:01.087 --> 07:02.282
I for one am appreciating

07:02.355 --> 07:03.846
our newfound sedentary
lifestyle.

07:03.923 --> 07:07.018
I appreciate our sedentary --
Oh my God! Why?!

07:07.093 --> 07:09.358
For one, I get to hang out
with Triana more.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.590
I saw you two.

07:10.663 --> 07:11.756
She treats you
like her friend.

07:11.831 --> 07:12.764
I am her friend.

07:12.832 --> 07:14.323
- Aaand, that's it.
- Nuh uhh!

07:14.400 --> 07:15.993
- Have you seen her naked?
- No.

07:16.068 --> 07:17.593
- Have you kissed her?
- No.

07:17.670 --> 07:19.662
- Have you even held her hand?
- No.

07:19.739 --> 07:21.765
And are you ready for the super
depressing part?

07:21.841 --> 07:23.833
Have you helped her
shop for shoes?

07:23.910 --> 07:25.344
Oh my glory!

07:25.411 --> 07:26.606
Dean, she's your hag.

07:26.679 --> 07:28.773
- You're right.
- It's gonna be okay.

07:28.848 --> 07:31.477
I know a place where
native girls abound!

07:31.551 --> 07:33.645
A paradise of young women
all waiting

07:33.719 --> 07:36.621
to venture into adventure
with a Dean Venture!

07:36.689 --> 07:37.713
Get your coat!

07:37.790 --> 07:41.124
But master,
The Outrider was my student!

07:41.194 --> 07:42.890
He was
a petulant layabout!

07:42.962 --> 07:45.261
There is no way he could
achieve this ability!

07:45.331 --> 07:46.390
Well, he did.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.401
Maybe he got super good
at meditating, I don't know.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.334
- Impossible!
- Well, Orpheus, it happened.

07:50.403 --> 07:51.302
Hey, are you looking
up my dress?

07:51.370 --> 07:52.702
See anything you miss?

07:52.772 --> 07:53.796
No...

07:53.873 --> 07:56.069
I don't miss her astounding
beauty daily.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.940
Orpheus, you can't take
being bested.

07:58.010 --> 07:59.979
You really thought that you
could just build a portal

08:00.046 --> 08:01.912
with lawn furniture
and go kick his ass?

08:01.981 --> 08:03.415
Well, yes.
Yes, I did.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.473
If that insect could do it.

08:04.550 --> 08:05.745
Okay, well go to it, champ!

08:05.818 --> 08:07.309
Go find a portal
and beat him up!

08:07.386 --> 08:08.979
Solved!
Just stop whining.

08:09.055 --> 08:10.580
You are giving me
a huge headache.

08:10.656 --> 08:12.124
Can you rub my temples?
- Must I?

08:12.191 --> 08:13.955
- Do you have an aspirin then?
- I don't take them.

08:14.026 --> 08:15.460
- What about ibuprofen?
- Sorry.

08:15.528 --> 08:17.326
- What about acedo-mino-mophin?
- Nope.

08:17.396 --> 08:18.420
- Tylenol PM?
- No.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.329
- What about ecstasy?
- Nothing.

08:19.398 --> 08:20.991
It's earsplitting,
Orpheus.

08:21.067 --> 08:22.035
Maybe I have a brain tumor.

08:22.101 --> 08:23.501
Seriously, you don't know any
other way to cure my headache?

08:23.569 --> 08:26.300
I can't really
think of one.

08:26.372 --> 08:27.601
Oh wait, I have one.

08:27.673 --> 08:29.608
Why don't you leave me alone
so I can jump rope naked

08:29.675 --> 08:32.110
in front of a mirror
in your ex-wife's body.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.145
Welcome to Girl Island.

08:35.914 --> 08:38.248
Hey Madison,
got your text.

08:38.317 --> 08:39.477
April!

08:39.552 --> 08:41.453
Little busy now,
can I hit you back later?

08:41.520 --> 08:44.116
Tina, see you got that...
blue hat.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.988
That you told me about
when we were--

08:46.058 --> 08:47.526
Okay, yeah, I'm busy too.

08:47.593 --> 08:48.788
You know all these girls?

08:48.861 --> 08:50.557
We talk.
I keep it cas'.

08:50.630 --> 08:52.121
Don't wanna get tied down.

08:52.198 --> 08:53.666
There are tons of ladies
out there.

08:53.733 --> 08:55.167
You can't walk
into your back yard

08:55.234 --> 08:57.032
and fall for the first girl
you see.

08:57.103 --> 08:58.401
Hank, you had a crush
on the mail lady

08:58.471 --> 08:59.370
for like five years.

08:59.438 --> 09:00.906
Ouch, touche.

09:00.973 --> 09:03.465
In my defense, she wore
very attractive shorts.

09:03.543 --> 09:04.476
And this isn't about me!

09:04.544 --> 09:06.376
You gotta get out there
and take a bite outta crime!

09:06.445 --> 09:07.845
Alright, let's get
this over with...

09:07.914 --> 09:08.813
what do I do?

09:08.881 --> 09:10.941
I've done some research
on the getting of ladies.

09:11.017 --> 09:13.179
First off, pull those pants
down from your armpits.

09:15.955 --> 09:18.220
Now muss up your hair.

09:18.291 --> 09:19.657
I look like Rufio.

09:19.725 --> 09:22.126
You are the Pan, Dean.
You are the Pan.

09:22.194 --> 09:23.992
Okay, that blonde
is showing indicators.

09:24.063 --> 09:25.998
Feigning disinterest
is a clear signal.

09:26.065 --> 09:27.761
Now go engage that two-set!

09:27.833 --> 09:28.823
What are you saying!?

09:28.901 --> 09:30.563
Go talk to them!

09:30.636 --> 09:32.195
My brother pushed me.

09:32.271 --> 09:35.036
You blew your opener, so lock in
and move to kino escalation.

09:35.107 --> 09:37.235
Body contact!

09:37.310 --> 09:39.905
Isolate the target,
and enter your set.

09:39.979 --> 09:42.346
I'll run wing
on the remainder.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.179
I'm going home.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.513
It's just a freeze-out!

09:45.585 --> 09:48.054
You can still reengage
and number close!

09:50.456 --> 09:52.391
This is
inappropriately short.

09:52.458 --> 09:53.756
ALCHEMIST:
How did it go?

09:53.826 --> 09:54.725
What are you doing in here?

09:54.794 --> 09:55.693
Did he mention me?

09:55.761 --> 09:58.128
The Master in your daughter's
closet, that may not exist?

09:58.197 --> 09:59.631
No, he didn't mention you.

09:59.699 --> 10:01.065
It went like it always does.

10:01.133 --> 10:03.193
He tore away at my heart
till he kicked me out.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.601
No mystic revelations?

10:04.670 --> 10:06.104
Clues to deeper meanings?

10:06.172 --> 10:09.700
No, he told me to go to my
portal and beat up The Outrider.

10:09.775 --> 10:11.437
Isn't that helpful?

10:11.510 --> 10:12.808
That's not the only portal.

10:12.878 --> 10:14.437
Honestly, that's not even
'a' portal.

10:14.513 --> 10:16.778
I think he wants us to go
to the original one.

10:16.849 --> 10:18.010
Al!

10:18.084 --> 10:20.315
You are again
a shining example

10:20.386 --> 10:22.446
of the Triad's great spark!

10:22.521 --> 10:24.683
Swoosh, and the crowd
goes crazy!

10:24.757 --> 10:26.726
So can I go into the closet
with you next time

10:26.792 --> 10:28.385
and meet your mystic Master?

10:28.461 --> 10:31.226
No, that's my--
that's my thing.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.232
Oh, hi Pumpkin.

10:33.299 --> 10:34.961
What were you guys doing
in my bedroom?

10:35.034 --> 10:37.594
Umm, well Al wanted, uh --

10:37.670 --> 10:41.732
I wanted to see your
CD collection!

10:41.807 --> 10:43.400
Yeah, I'm
old-school deathrock.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.342
I used to go
to the bat cave

10:45.411 --> 10:47.812
when Nick Fiend was
still the doorman.

10:47.880 --> 10:50.315
Yes! That's true.
He was.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.318
We'd love to stay and bail
ourselves out, but we--

10:52.385 --> 10:54.752
Yes!
So... with wings of light!

10:54.820 --> 10:56.618
By day and night!

10:56.689 --> 10:58.681
We make our flight!

11:03.729 --> 11:05.357
Hello?

11:08.668 --> 11:11.399
[all screaming ]

11:11.470 --> 11:12.665
- Knew it!
- Every time!

11:12.738 --> 11:14.604
So close!
So close.

11:14.674 --> 11:15.505
No, it's true.

11:15.574 --> 11:16.735
We were way closer
to the ground this time.

11:16.809 --> 11:17.640
You know it's me.

11:17.710 --> 11:19.372
You won't admit that
the non-magic Blackula hunter

11:19.445 --> 11:20.708
is holding you back.

11:20.780 --> 11:23.181
Jefferson, astral peregrination
is very difficult.

11:23.249 --> 11:25.081
It could be something as minor
as a weight issue.

11:25.151 --> 11:26.779
Okay, that is
a genetic problem!

11:26.852 --> 11:28.753
So why don't we stop
picking on the fat kid

11:28.821 --> 11:30.619
and crank this portal up.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.785
Place is creeping me out.

11:33.859 --> 11:35.350
Man, somebody's
been practicing.

11:35.428 --> 11:36.691
I didn't do anything.

11:36.762 --> 11:38.128
That's just happening.

11:38.197 --> 11:40.325
Triad! Be unseen!

11:40.399 --> 11:42.891
Was something
supposed to happen?

11:42.968 --> 11:44.436
Are we invisible now,
or something?

11:44.503 --> 11:45.869
No, I meant that
we should hide.

11:45.938 --> 11:47.736
Just like
behind something.

11:47.807 --> 11:51.039
ALCHEMIST:
Well be specific next time.

11:54.513 --> 11:59.542
[ coughing ]

11:59.618 --> 12:01.280
Kill me, Outrider.

12:01.353 --> 12:02.753
I have seen too much.

12:02.822 --> 12:05.485
Hell is my every sight,
my every thought...

12:05.558 --> 12:07.151
end my pain!

12:07.226 --> 12:09.718
Silat!
Anabotas!

12:09.795 --> 12:12.094
Deliver this infidel
to peace.

12:12.164 --> 12:15.032
His suffering has
been long enough.

12:15.101 --> 12:17.002
My pain is yours,
Outrider!

12:17.069 --> 12:18.867
I devour you!

12:18.938 --> 12:21.169
Albrot, abracadabra, el!

12:21.240 --> 12:23.106
Enter the dragon's eye!

12:23.175 --> 12:25.269
I condemn you
to damnation!

12:25.344 --> 12:26.312
[ Outrider screaming in agony]

12:30.082 --> 12:32.677
That was 100% bad-ass!

12:32.752 --> 12:34.618
That was total movie cool.

12:34.687 --> 12:36.849
And Torrid actually said
"abracadabra."

12:36.922 --> 12:38.948
I so thought that was
a fake magic word.

12:39.024 --> 12:40.788
It's a real magic word.

12:40.860 --> 12:42.852
One of the three
holy names...

12:42.928 --> 12:44.453
Oh, look at his face!

12:44.530 --> 12:46.226
Great, so we take credit
for killing Torrid,

12:46.298 --> 12:48.494
you take credit for kicking
The Outrider's ass,

12:48.567 --> 12:51.036
then we make a secret pact

12:51.103 --> 12:52.969
to never speak
of this again.

12:53.038 --> 12:54.939
I've been wrong about
The Outrider.

12:55.007 --> 12:57.203
He was noble and good.

12:57.276 --> 12:59.802
We can't leave him
like this.

12:59.879 --> 13:01.711
Okay, we drop a rock
on his head,

13:01.781 --> 13:05.047
then we make a secret pact to
never speak of this again.

13:05.117 --> 13:06.551
No.
Help me get him up.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.315
We are going to rescue him...

13:08.387 --> 13:10.913
from Hell!

13:10.990 --> 13:11.821
Hello?

13:11.891 --> 13:13.519
Is anyone in here?

13:13.592 --> 13:15.220
Hi, sugar-dumpling.
I was just vacuuming.

13:15.294 --> 13:17.661
After this I'm gonna watch TV,
then cry myself to sleep.

13:17.730 --> 13:19.562
I don't know, I might wake you
up in the middle of the night

13:19.632 --> 13:22.158
and threaten to kill myself
if you leave me... again.

13:22.234 --> 13:23.998
So! How's work?

13:24.069 --> 13:26.163
What is this?
Who are you?

13:26.238 --> 13:28.707
Baby-doll, it's me, your loyal
husband, Dean Venture.

13:28.774 --> 13:31.300
I'm your future!
Isn't this great?!

13:31.377 --> 13:32.640
[ baby crying ]

13:32.711 --> 13:34.441
That's our baby, Rusty Jr.

13:34.513 --> 13:37.347
Well, if you can
call it a baby.

13:37.416 --> 13:39.112
It's got like a leg
growing out of what

13:39.185 --> 13:41.017
would be the head
on a regular baby.

13:41.086 --> 13:43.248
And if you squeeze him,
poop comes out of his eyes

13:43.322 --> 13:44.756
and a little bit
under his fingernails.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.349
I just walked into a closet!

13:46.425 --> 13:48.189
What is going on?

13:48.260 --> 13:50.627
We had a deformed kid
because my gene pool

13:50.696 --> 13:52.392
is more of like
a gene septic tank.

13:52.464 --> 13:55.298
Yeah, I was cloned so much
I only make monster babies.

13:55.367 --> 13:57.768
Wait, Dean was cloned?

13:57.837 --> 13:59.328
Dean was cloned,
Hank was cloned,

13:59.405 --> 14:01.135
and you've been here like
10 times before this.

14:01.207 --> 14:02.106
Surprise!

14:02.174 --> 14:04.040
Somebody's been getting
her memory wiped!

14:04.109 --> 14:05.372
Dean!

14:05.444 --> 14:06.537
Deeeean!

14:06.612 --> 14:08.080
Deeeean!

14:08.147 --> 14:10.048
Hey fart knocker!
Over here!

14:10.115 --> 14:11.549
Dude, what are you
doing here?

14:11.617 --> 14:13.210
Came for a new pair
of heavy bag gloves.

14:13.285 --> 14:15.777
Tore through my last pair
whaling on the bag.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.721
Then why are you wearing
a Big Bargains apron?

14:17.790 --> 14:18.758
I don't know.
What are you doing here?

14:18.824 --> 14:20.349
I thought your old man
kept you on a leash.

14:20.426 --> 14:22.895
I can't find my brother and we
have to be home by dark.

14:22.962 --> 14:24.294
Sucks to be you.

14:24.363 --> 14:25.831
Oh snap!
I found your brother.

14:25.898 --> 14:26.888
Where?

14:26.966 --> 14:28.730
Duh, the guy with the other
flying scooter.

14:28.801 --> 14:31.293
Holy shit,
he's talking to a girl!

14:31.370 --> 14:34.363
Maybe we should strip him down
and rub him with magic unctions?

14:34.440 --> 14:35.703
How will that help him?

14:35.774 --> 14:37.242
Him? I was thinking of me.

14:37.309 --> 14:39.642
We can't bring him back
till we know how he got there.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.544
There are doors
to the second world.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.412
You must exit the one
you entered.

14:43.482 --> 14:45.110
So, back to the portal?

14:45.184 --> 14:46.709
Portals are like windows.

14:46.785 --> 14:49.311
We need the door.
The original door.

14:49.388 --> 14:51.857
This is confusing.
I'm getting a headache.

14:51.924 --> 14:54.393
I don't have any asp-- wait!

14:54.460 --> 14:56.622
Yes! How did I miss it?!

14:56.695 --> 14:59.324
The master asked me
to cure his headache.

14:59.398 --> 15:03.494
A headache so severe
that medication couldn't help.

15:03.569 --> 15:06.095
Of course!
Trepanning.

15:06.171 --> 15:07.002
Home brain surgery!

15:09.008 --> 15:11.568
I've had all the hot chicks
in this town.

15:11.644 --> 15:13.510
Yeah, my new one,
she lives out of state.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.514
We hook up whenever
I road trip.

15:15.581 --> 15:16.549
Is she pretty?

15:16.615 --> 15:18.880
Dude, she's a model.
She's like 23.

15:18.951 --> 15:21.079
Well, Tracy --
that's the girl I just met.

15:21.153 --> 15:22.121
She's a cashier.

15:22.187 --> 15:23.348
You gonna go
for that piece?

15:23.422 --> 15:25.288
I'm kinda seeing
someone else.

15:25.357 --> 15:26.416
What are you, married?

15:26.492 --> 15:28.188
Man, do you dig
this Tracy girl or what?

15:28.260 --> 15:29.558
Well, she seems nice.

15:29.628 --> 15:30.857
And her hair is
really pretty.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.193
Well talk to her then.

15:32.264 --> 15:34.460
You don't have to nail her.
Just see what happens.

15:34.533 --> 15:36.195
Man, way to be uptight.

15:36.268 --> 15:38.260
Wait, did you just give
good advice?

15:38.337 --> 15:39.999
I gotta go check
the temperature in hell.

15:40.072 --> 15:41.472
You can both blow me.

15:41.540 --> 15:44.339
It's like he used a bottle
opener on his prefrontal cortex.

15:44.410 --> 15:46.208
He all but gave himself
a lobotomy.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.270
Holy shit!
There's an old marble in here!

15:48.347 --> 15:49.212
It's an amulet.

15:49.281 --> 15:50.681
The Eye of Osiris.

15:50.749 --> 15:52.741
They were placed in the wound
left after embalming

15:52.818 --> 15:54.810
to protect the mummy on his
journey to the underworld.

15:54.887 --> 15:57.322
- It's filthy.
- Remove it at once!

15:57.389 --> 15:58.721
The Outrider did it.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.817
He found a shortcut
to the second world.

16:00.893 --> 16:04.330
I'm not sure if he's the bravest
sorcerer, or the stupidest.

16:04.396 --> 16:05.728
It's out!
I did it.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.391
So, am I part of the triad?

16:07.466 --> 16:09.196
Triad implies three.

16:09.268 --> 16:10.668
So...

16:10.736 --> 16:13.570
Alright, Then you guys have to
pay my rather steep fee.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.767
Welcome to the mystical order
of The Triad,

16:15.841 --> 16:17.503
special brother Billy!

16:17.576 --> 16:18.874
Why is he still like that?

16:18.944 --> 16:20.139
We must draw him out!

16:20.212 --> 16:22.340
Draw him from hell, with hell.

16:22.414 --> 16:25.145
Quickly! What is the worst thing
that ever happened to you?!

16:25.217 --> 16:27.516
Ummm, I saw my mom
raped by Blackulas.

16:27.586 --> 16:29.578
I was ten...
she called my name.

16:29.655 --> 16:31.248
I just stood there.

16:31.323 --> 16:32.518
Ahhh, wow.

16:32.591 --> 16:34.253
Wait. I can hear him!

16:34.326 --> 16:35.692
More ugliness!

16:35.761 --> 16:37.457
Ummm, I once saw
two homeless guys

16:37.529 --> 16:38.861
giving each other oral sex.

16:38.931 --> 16:41.025
Yes! He's closer!
More like that.

16:41.100 --> 16:42.796
Okay, this is really gross.

16:42.868 --> 16:45.861
Once I was out of toilet paper
so I used cotton balls.

16:45.938 --> 16:47.338
So, you know, I'm wiping,

16:47.406 --> 16:49.637
and I think my finger kinda
poked through the cotton.

16:49.708 --> 16:51.836
So I --
and do not ask me why --

16:51.910 --> 16:53.606
I smell my finger to check.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.545
Gross.
I see where this is going.

16:55.614 --> 16:57.446
Quickly, Al!
He's so close!

16:57.516 --> 16:59.451
Okay, I bring it up
to smell it, right.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.749
But somehow the cotton got stuck
to my fingers,

17:01.820 --> 17:03.448
so when I smell my fingers,

17:03.522 --> 17:05.888
the cotton's getting stuck
to my razor stubble.

17:05.958 --> 17:08.655
So I have this shitty cotton
all over my face!

17:12.397 --> 17:14.765
- This can't be good.
- Tell me about it.

17:14.833 --> 17:16.768
Hey, do I really
look that short?

17:16.835 --> 17:18.098
I mean, you like him, right?

17:18.170 --> 17:19.661
Yeah, but not in that way.

17:19.738 --> 17:21.205
I mean, I could...
maybe.

17:21.272 --> 17:22.935
I don't know.
It's so confusing.

17:23.008 --> 17:25.340
I didn't know I had to make up
my mind so fast.

17:25.411 --> 17:26.378
Maybe-schmaby!

17:26.444 --> 17:27.469
You gotta set that kid free,

17:27.546 --> 17:28.946
or you better start
getting into this!

17:29.014 --> 17:30.312
Did you know that he is
uncircumcised?

17:30.382 --> 17:32.613
Yeah, Mr. Baldy will forever
wear his turtleneck.

17:32.684 --> 17:34.346
That's so gross.

17:34.420 --> 17:35.547
Do I have
to break his heart?

17:35.621 --> 17:37.453
No, you don't have
to break his heart,

17:37.523 --> 17:39.458
but you do have to clean
his penis with a Q-tip.

17:39.525 --> 17:40.458
Okay, I'm the master.

17:40.526 --> 17:42.427
I'm like your dad's
omniscient boss.

17:42.494 --> 17:44.292
So let me give you
some advice.

17:44.363 --> 17:45.558
Get on with your life.

17:45.631 --> 17:47.964
You think just anyone can walk
into your closet and see me?

17:48.033 --> 17:49.023
Never thought about that.

17:49.101 --> 17:51.297
That's a regular closet
to anyone without the gift!

17:51.370 --> 17:52.895
You should start
your training now.

17:52.971 --> 17:54.997
And seriously, you can make
better money at this stuff

17:55.074 --> 17:56.770
than you can as a manager
of the Gap.

17:56.842 --> 17:58.743
My dad kinda wants me
to go to art school.

17:58.811 --> 18:00.746
And get the world's most
useless diploma!?

18:00.813 --> 18:02.304
Forget your dad.

18:02.381 --> 18:04.714
He's trying to save you
from his life, not yours.

18:04.783 --> 18:06.775
Triana Orpheus, you should go
live with your mother

18:06.852 --> 18:08.787
and begin your training
to be a sorceress.

18:08.854 --> 18:09.878
It's your destiny!

18:09.955 --> 18:11.218
And it's way cheaper
than art school!

18:11.290 --> 18:14.818
Wow. Ya know, that all
seems so right.

18:14.893 --> 18:16.987
It's like everything just
makes sense now.

18:17.062 --> 18:20.055
Too bad you will forget
all this ever happened.

18:20.132 --> 18:22.727
Okay, a toupee might
be too severe.

18:22.801 --> 18:24.099
Maybe a hat?

18:24.169 --> 18:25.137
Gentlemen,
welcome to Hell.

18:27.139 --> 18:28.801
It kinda looks like
Orpheus' kitchen.

18:28.874 --> 18:30.502
I kinda imagined it would be,

18:30.576 --> 18:33.011
I don't know, hotter,
maybe some lava pits.

18:33.078 --> 18:34.569
SIMBA:
I don't like dry cat food.

18:34.646 --> 18:35.807
Simba?

18:35.881 --> 18:37.679
Tell your daughter I don't like
being scratched near my tail.

18:37.749 --> 18:38.944
She just doesn't get it.

18:39.017 --> 18:40.508
Oh...
I'm sorry.

18:40.586 --> 18:42.111
Okay, that's better.

18:42.187 --> 18:43.883
More what I was looking for.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.948
I apologize, Outrider.

18:46.024 --> 18:48.186
I was blinded by my jealousy.

18:48.260 --> 18:51.424
I just couldn't deal with being
bested in so many ways.

18:51.497 --> 18:53.261
Ya know, I idolized you.

18:53.332 --> 18:55.130
You were everything
I wanted to be.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.361
Then when I got to know you,

18:56.435 --> 18:58.131
I realized how you got
so powerful.

18:58.203 --> 19:00.570
You sacrificed everything.

19:00.639 --> 19:03.541
And I knew there was a quicker
way to enlightenment.

19:03.609 --> 19:05.100
Oops, sorry.

19:05.177 --> 19:06.008
I'm in hell.

19:06.078 --> 19:08.604
Quicker, yes.
But clearly more dangerous.

19:08.680 --> 19:11.013
Family was just
more important to me.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.949
Whoa!
Okay, let me get that...

19:13.018 --> 19:14.111
That is...

19:14.186 --> 19:16.485
Um...You dropped your
dino-damage.

19:16.555 --> 19:19.423
Yes, I know that I was
a rotten husband,

19:19.491 --> 19:22.359
and not much of a father,
but I tried to --

19:22.427 --> 19:24.987
Why don't you
and Brundle-Fly here

19:25.063 --> 19:27.430
finish this love-fest
outside of Hell?

19:27.499 --> 19:29.798
Oh, we can't leave.

19:29.868 --> 19:32.565
You need to be between the two
worlds to bring us back.

19:32.638 --> 19:34.800
You are trapped with me.

19:34.873 --> 19:37.001
Are you sleeping?

19:37.075 --> 19:38.737
Huh? What?
Oh...

19:38.810 --> 19:40.574
I was just thinking.

19:40.646 --> 19:41.909
Did Triana call?

19:41.980 --> 19:43.039
Nobody called you.

19:43.115 --> 19:44.583
Ya know, I don't think you've
ever gotten a phone call.

19:44.650 --> 19:46.175
Because if she did,
I wasn't here.

19:46.251 --> 19:47.651
I was out with the boys.

19:47.719 --> 19:49.244
Meeting girls and stuff.

19:49.321 --> 19:50.448
Okay.

19:50.522 --> 19:52.423
If a girl does call,
I'll be in my room.

19:52.491 --> 19:53.925
And I'll be here, Dean.

19:53.992 --> 19:55.255
Are you okay?

19:55.327 --> 19:58.058
Yeah...
I'm pretty good.

19:58.130 --> 19:59.860
Well did you have to remove
the Eye of Osiris

19:59.932 --> 20:01.366
from my brain?

20:01.433 --> 20:02.799
That was working great.

20:02.868 --> 20:06.066
Me? Torrid messed that up.
I'm clean.

20:06.138 --> 20:07.834
That guy's a loser.

20:07.906 --> 20:09.340
Seriously.

20:09.408 --> 20:11.900
It's always the guy that opens
up hell that gets killed first.

20:11.977 --> 20:13.605
That's basic.

20:13.679 --> 20:15.443
That is, like, first-year
villain stuff.

20:15.514 --> 20:16.948
I can hear you guys.

20:17.015 --> 20:20.747
Jefferson, you are
between worlds!

20:20.819 --> 20:22.845
Dude!
You have a magic power!

20:22.921 --> 20:24.150
Really?!
I'm magic?

20:24.223 --> 20:28.422
Yes! Outstretch your hand
and bring us home!

20:28.493 --> 20:30.826
I'm trying...
is it moving?

20:30.896 --> 20:32.990
Meh.
You really gotta lean into it.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.966
I'm magic! Damn!

20:35.033 --> 20:36.661
Magic Blackula hunter!

20:36.735 --> 20:38.863
That should do it!
Orpheus?

20:38.937 --> 20:41.771
After you.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.570
Al, your turn.

20:43.642 --> 20:44.837
Orpheus is back.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.936
I am so totally magic!

20:47.012 --> 20:50.278
Ugh! We are never gonna hear
the end of this.

20:57.522 --> 20:59.684
[laughs ]
No, no, no, really!

20:59.758 --> 21:02.728
This woman is easily
230 pounds,

21:02.794 --> 21:04.888
and she has Orpheus tied up,
right...

21:04.963 --> 21:06.989
Was he kidnapped to perform
experimental surgery?

21:07.065 --> 21:09.398
[laughs ]
No, that's your thing!

21:09.468 --> 21:11.403
Five times this year alone!

21:11.470 --> 21:13.564
Hi, sweetie.

21:13.639 --> 21:15.164
Can't sleep?

21:15.240 --> 21:16.435
Yeah...

21:16.508 --> 21:18.443
Hey, can we talk?

21:46.738 --> 21:48.366
Now if you can't get my phone,

21:48.440 --> 21:49.874
you have my e-mail address.

21:49.941 --> 21:51.705
And if that doesn't work

21:51.777 --> 21:53.405
you can psychically communicate
any time.

21:53.478 --> 21:55.276
Dad!
I'm just going to mom's.

21:55.347 --> 21:58.010
I'll see you all the time.
Relax.

21:58.083 --> 21:59.847
Okay, okay...
I worry.

21:59.918 --> 22:02.752
Jefferson, you wanna
hand me that bag?

22:02.821 --> 22:05.552
Hold on!
I'll use my magic powers!

22:08.960 --> 22:11.953
Yes, uh, why don't you just
hand it to me regular?

22:12.030 --> 22:14.226
Can we talk?

22:14.299 --> 22:16.598
You know what this
means, right?

22:16.668 --> 22:20.537
Yes, my little girl
has grown up.

22:20.605 --> 22:21.834
Ahhh, no.

22:21.907 --> 22:24.775
It means that we are gonna have
to throw a huge party

22:24.843 --> 22:26.971
in your empty house!

22:27.045 --> 22:28.570
I've been doing
a lot of thinking,

22:28.647 --> 22:31.344
and I think we should
see other people.

22:31.416 --> 22:33.476
Long distance relationships
can be rough.

22:33.552 --> 22:35.282
You are so wise, Dean.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.687
I'm gonna miss you.

22:37.756 --> 22:40.749
Or maybe we could try
a long distance relationship?

22:40.826 --> 22:42.590
There are too many girls
waiting in line.

22:42.661 --> 22:44.755
I can't hog you
all to myself.

22:44.830 --> 22:47.459
True.
