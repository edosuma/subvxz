41:47.573 --> 41:50.876
* The one who says
"You got time to breathe *
[ Shouts ]

41:50.909 --> 41:54.846
* 'Cause, child, you were born
We're all born free" *

41:54.880 --> 41:58.216
* For we've been

41:58.249 --> 42:00.919
* Out running

42:00.952 --> 42:05.757
* For all of our lives

42:07.626 --> 42:10.662
* No chance

42:10.696 --> 42:13.832
* In stopping
I'm a go.

42:13.865 --> 42:17.335
* We'd surely lose sight

42:17.368 --> 42:19.638
Please stand.

42:19.671 --> 42:23.809
* In the back of his mind
is a smiling face *

42:23.842 --> 42:27.445
* The one who said
"You know, it's no race" *

42:27.478 --> 42:31.917
* The one who says
"You got time to breathe *

42:31.950 --> 42:36.187
* 'Cause, child, you were born
We're all born free" *

42:36.221 --> 42:40.291
* But the back of his mind
is the back of a room *
Please be seated.

42:40.325 --> 42:44.630
* So dust enshrouded
and no dust broom *

42:44.663 --> 42:48.734
Congratulations, General.
* Stands a chance
to clear the cobwebs away *

42:48.767 --> 42:52.804
* So there in the back
In the dark it'll stay *

42:52.838 --> 42:54.806
* And we've

42:54.840 --> 42:58.977
* Been out running

42:59.010 --> 43:03.815
* For all of our lives

43:03.849 --> 43:05.784
You may now
kiss the bride.

43:05.817 --> 43:09.120
* No chance

43:09.154 --> 43:11.022
* In stopping

43:11.056 --> 43:15.226
* We'd surely lose sight

43:21.266 --> 43:25.370
* Tell me, son
What are you livin' for *

43:25.403 --> 43:29.708
* Tell me, boy
What are you livin' for *

43:29.741 --> 43:33.779
* Tell me, son
What are you livin' for *

43:33.812 --> 43:38.216
* Tell me, tell me
What are you livin' for **
