WEBVTT

00:07.199 --> 00:08.734
Ruby.

00:08.834 --> 00:10.670
Kaya? Is that you?

00:10.770 --> 00:13.238
The portal to the netherworld
has been established.

00:13.339 --> 00:15.808
Free me and I'll stand with you again.

00:15.908 --> 00:18.444
I'll free you
when I find a suitable host.

00:18.544 --> 00:20.045
Well, Pablo has this weird
writing all over him.

00:20.145 --> 00:21.313
Maybe he can decipher.

00:23.683 --> 00:25.250
Am I dead again?

00:25.351 --> 00:26.752
You left yourself vulnerable to evil.

00:26.852 --> 00:29.221
Now you must prove yourself worthy.

00:29.321 --> 00:33.061
<i>Â¡Yo soy el Brujo Especial!</i>

00:34.037 --> 00:35.795
That cute little kid is a demon.

00:35.895 --> 00:38.097
What is that dastardly Ruby up to now?!

00:38.197 --> 00:39.449
He hurt me.

00:39.486 --> 00:41.074
You've got some explaining
to do Mr. Williams.

00:41.144 --> 00:43.002
Dad, get in!

00:43.102 --> 00:46.005
You know this is the first time
you ever called me dad.

00:46.129 --> 00:48.371
You fuck with my Pablo,
you fuck with me.

00:48.437 --> 00:50.973
And I am done being fucked with Ruby.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.074

01:08.594 --> 01:10.863
You're almost there.

01:10.963 --> 01:13.437
Once that idiot Ash Williams is dead,

01:13.510 --> 01:16.212
you and I will go on to immortal glory.

01:40.926 --> 01:42.666
Kelly!

01:42.720 --> 01:44.229
What a lovely surprise...

01:48.502 --> 01:50.637
<i>That</i> was for Pablo getting possessed!

01:56.343 --> 01:59.446
That was for Brandy's mom...

01:59.546 --> 02:00.847
Oh, come on...

02:11.358 --> 02:12.492
And this one?

02:13.960 --> 02:15.229
Kelly, stop...

02:19.199 --> 02:21.167
This one's for me.

02:30.210 --> 02:33.980
Shoot me all you want, you stupid girl.

02:34.080 --> 02:36.883
You forget I'm immortal.

02:36.983 --> 02:38.552
I didn't forget.

02:46.125 --> 02:47.827
So I brought this.

02:50.297 --> 02:52.299
The dagger.

02:52.399 --> 02:54.303
You're the one who found it.

02:55.435 --> 02:57.571
Don't you just love a good surprise.

03:04.481 --> 03:06.346
It burns, doesn't it?

03:06.446 --> 03:08.948
You're not worthy.

03:12.786 --> 03:15.268
Did you really think
it was gonna be that easy?

03:15.385 --> 03:16.556
Did you?

03:17.826 --> 03:20.662
Don't start a fight you can't finish...

03:21.060 --> 03:23.377
All right, you she-devil fuck!

03:23.431 --> 03:24.566
Let's go.

03:42.384 --> 03:44.486
I can't believe this!

03:44.586 --> 03:46.921
A week ago I was cramming for midterms

03:47.021 --> 03:47.989
and now I'm running from the cops!

03:48.090 --> 03:49.491
Ooh, bad idea.

03:49.591 --> 03:52.260
Until the heat dies down, no lights.

03:52.360 --> 03:55.330
Sounds like someone's
hidden from the cops before.

03:55.430 --> 03:57.099
I don't have to answer that.

03:58.866 --> 04:01.303
I gotta admit, though,

04:01.403 --> 04:03.871
you handled that Delta with style.

04:03.971 --> 04:05.207
Just gotta remember though,

04:05.307 --> 04:06.841
that ass end starts to skid,

04:06.941 --> 04:07.942
you just gotta give it...

04:08.042 --> 04:09.677
- a little gas.
- A little gas.

04:09.777 --> 04:12.780
Y'know I've been thinkin' it,
now I'm gonna say it:

04:12.880 --> 04:14.216
like daughter like dad.

04:17.285 --> 04:20.588
So that kid in your car...

04:20.688 --> 04:21.689
The Demon imposter kid.

04:21.789 --> 04:23.091
Yeah.

04:23.191 --> 04:25.860
And you really think that that had
something to do with Ms. Prevett?

04:25.960 --> 04:28.630
Look, that little freak was
running all over her house!

04:28.730 --> 04:31.999
Granted, the trunk thing
might've raised some eyebrows,

04:32.100 --> 04:34.269
but this so called
counselor of yours, kiddo.

04:34.369 --> 04:36.438
I can't say enough bad things about her!

04:38.740 --> 04:40.208
You gotta eat.

04:43.478 --> 04:45.813
Oh, my God.

04:45.913 --> 04:47.249
This is so much better toasted.

04:47.349 --> 04:49.884
Look, I hear what you're saying,

04:49.984 --> 04:52.754
but Ms. Prevett has been nothing
but kind and thoughtful to me.

04:52.854 --> 04:55.957
Okay? The stern "father"
voice doesn't change that.

04:56.057 --> 04:57.525
Oh.

04:58.489 --> 05:00.491
Look at me.

05:00.662 --> 05:02.530
I need to go clean up.

05:02.630 --> 05:03.998
Demon spunk!

05:04.098 --> 05:05.667
It's so gross!

05:10.738 --> 05:11.973
Mr. Williams!

05:12.073 --> 05:13.475
Oh, shit.

05:20.248 --> 05:22.617
Mr. Williams, we're with Dalton!

05:27.689 --> 05:29.224
Yeah?

05:33.127 --> 05:35.730
Oh, my God.

05:35.830 --> 05:37.632
It's really him.

05:40.034 --> 05:41.603
Do you guys get discounts on kneepads?

05:41.703 --> 05:43.338
Ash Williams,
we're with the Knights of...

05:43.438 --> 05:44.539
Oh, not this again!

05:44.639 --> 05:46.107
Spare me will you?

05:46.208 --> 05:48.276
Dalton already told me
the whole boring story.

05:48.376 --> 05:52.046
Wait. You must know the world
is in grave danger.

05:52.146 --> 05:54.582
Look, Dalton sent for us,
but he's disappeared.

05:54.682 --> 05:56.384
All right, come on in.

05:56.484 --> 05:58.386
Don't touch any of my stuff.

06:02.324 --> 06:03.958
Yeah, don't kill the messenger,

06:04.058 --> 06:07.028
but I heard your buddy bought
a one-way ticket to demon-ville.

06:07.128 --> 06:09.364
Years ago, another Knight came
to Elk Grove looking for you.

06:09.464 --> 06:11.165
He never came back either.

06:11.266 --> 06:13.801
We call ourselves
the Knights of Sumeria.

06:17.572 --> 06:18.840
Pushy guy?

06:18.940 --> 06:19.807
Long leather jacket?

06:19.907 --> 06:21.075
Gary's here?

06:21.175 --> 06:22.677
Mm, in a dead kind of way.

06:22.777 --> 06:25.913
He left a bunch of ancient
scribbles on my cellar wall.

06:28.983 --> 06:30.252
And these.

06:32.554 --> 06:34.387
They're the lost pages
of the Necronomicon!

06:34.458 --> 06:35.473
Don't get too excited.

06:35.523 --> 06:36.658
Last person who read those

06:36.758 --> 06:38.393
wound up with a dagger in their back.

06:38.493 --> 06:40.295
Mr. Williams,
if you show us this writing,

06:40.395 --> 06:43.398
we might be able to end
this nightmare once and for all.

06:44.799 --> 06:45.967
End evil.

06:46.067 --> 06:48.069
For all time?

06:48.169 --> 06:50.137
Lady you're yankin' my crank.

06:50.238 --> 06:51.606
No, no, we're not! Honest!

06:51.706 --> 06:52.807
You better not be,

06:52.907 --> 06:54.342
because my daughter
is on evil's short-list,

06:54.442 --> 06:56.678
and she's the best cook
this house ever had.

06:56.778 --> 06:58.680
Okay, come on.

07:01.402 --> 07:02.550
Let's roll.

07:18.366 --> 07:20.201
Big mistake coming here alone.

07:20.302 --> 07:22.437
Maybe.

07:22.537 --> 07:24.739
But no one else
was gonna die on my watch.

07:24.839 --> 07:27.809
And I've been waiting
for this moment a long time.

07:29.344 --> 07:30.945
Let's see whatcha got.

07:33.315 --> 07:35.283
Ohhhh, fuck!

07:48.763 --> 07:50.298
Fuck!

08:08.483 --> 08:09.884
I'll give it to you.

08:09.984 --> 08:11.353
Digging up that dagger, coming in here,

08:11.453 --> 08:13.988
all guns blazing, it wasn't a bad plan.

08:15.857 --> 08:18.560
You giving out gold stars today, teach?

08:18.660 --> 08:20.127
It was a terrible plan.

08:24.198 --> 08:25.867
And your little Knight friend...

08:25.967 --> 08:28.135
His name was Dalton.

08:28.235 --> 08:29.437
Well, he's dead.

08:35.047 --> 08:36.510
We've all sworn to protect you.

08:36.611 --> 08:38.179
It's our sacred duty.

08:38.279 --> 08:39.514
Ah, yeah, well that's very flattering.

08:39.614 --> 08:41.948
But this kimosabe already has a Tonto.

08:42.049 --> 08:45.520
Hey, let's back to the part
about getting rid of evil.

08:45.620 --> 08:47.055
The Dark One that betrayed
the others, knew...

08:47.125 --> 08:48.823
She's got a name now. She's called Ruby.

08:48.923 --> 08:50.191
Ruby?

08:50.291 --> 08:52.627
Mm-hm, I guess succubus was taken.

08:52.727 --> 08:54.945
Ruby used a Necromancer named Kaya

08:55.024 --> 08:56.464
to exile the other Dark Ones.

08:56.534 --> 08:57.836
Look, if they get free,

08:57.936 --> 09:00.172
they'll start a war
that'll destroy mankind.

09:00.272 --> 09:02.875
But you guys are here
to stop that, right?

09:02.975 --> 09:05.443
Our mission has been
to find the prophesied one.

09:05.543 --> 09:07.245
Mission accomplished baby.

09:07.345 --> 09:09.214
It's said that he will have the
Necronomicon Ex-Mortis and...

09:11.316 --> 09:14.386
And only together can evil
be banished from this world.

09:14.486 --> 09:15.453
Forever.

09:15.553 --> 09:16.554
Mm.

09:16.654 --> 09:17.689
About that.

09:17.790 --> 09:20.192
Hypothetically, um...

09:20.292 --> 09:22.660
what if, what if I didn't have the book?

09:22.761 --> 09:23.661
You don't have the book?

09:23.762 --> 09:25.463
I said hypothetically.

09:25.563 --> 09:27.365
Come on.

09:27.465 --> 09:28.433
Okay, it's true.

09:28.533 --> 09:30.602
I don't have it. Ruby does.

09:30.702 --> 09:32.604
I mean the end of days is-is upon us.

09:32.704 --> 09:34.172
There's still a chance.

09:34.272 --> 09:36.108
Look, hopefully what
ever Gary left in the cellar

09:36.208 --> 09:38.243
will take us to the Dead lands.

09:38.343 --> 09:41.046
- Doesn't sound like a very happy place.
- Yeah, well, it's not.

09:41.146 --> 09:43.281
It's where the Dark Ones
have been imprisoned.

09:43.381 --> 09:45.884
Man, you guys are such a buzz kill.

09:45.984 --> 09:47.052
Let's get wasted.

09:49.254 --> 09:52.991
All right, I should have
opened this months ago.

09:54.326 --> 09:57.162
Sorry, <i>Brujo</i>, let's see what you got.

10:04.469 --> 10:06.071
Whoa...

10:10.742 --> 10:12.144
This shit really happened.

10:13.578 --> 10:15.347
Naked lady?!

10:21.286 --> 10:22.888
Dad?

10:23.621 --> 10:25.290
Dad?

10:29.661 --> 10:31.663
- Pablo!
- Hey.

10:31.763 --> 10:33.565
You're still better, right?

10:33.665 --> 10:37.084
Oh, no. Yeah. No, no, I-I'm good.

10:37.640 --> 10:39.341
I'm sorry about the crazy.

10:39.637 --> 10:41.606
Are you okay?

10:41.706 --> 10:43.641
Have you seen my dad?

10:43.741 --> 10:45.177
I mean he was here a few minutes ago,

10:45.277 --> 10:47.045
and now I can't find him anywhere.

10:49.547 --> 10:51.749
Have you checked the fridge?
Are we outta beer?

10:51.850 --> 10:54.086
Nope, and I'm kinda getting worried.

11:05.463 --> 11:06.431
What?

11:07.499 --> 11:08.566
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

11:10.835 --> 11:12.570
I think your dad's in trouble.

11:12.670 --> 11:13.939
But how would you know that?

11:14.039 --> 11:15.307
I've gotta get to the hardware store.

11:17.309 --> 11:19.111
Kelly gets back, you let
her know what's going down.

11:19.211 --> 11:20.245
It's probably safer if you stay here.

11:20.345 --> 11:21.313
All right?

11:21.413 --> 11:22.314
Lock the door behind me.

11:22.414 --> 11:23.315
Wait. What about you?

11:23.415 --> 11:24.849
I gotta roll.

11:24.950 --> 11:26.284
<i>Jefe</i> needs me.

11:28.453 --> 11:29.854
Okay.

11:32.390 --> 11:34.192
Watch your steps,

11:34.292 --> 11:36.194
'cause your <i>compadre</i> sure didn't.

11:39.664 --> 11:41.799
There's your boy.

11:41.900 --> 11:44.002
Poor Gary.

11:44.102 --> 11:45.570
But at least he died battling evil.

11:45.670 --> 11:48.503
Actually, he picked a fight with
my 75 year old dad.

12:00.452 --> 12:02.354
Gary obviously left this translation

12:02.454 --> 12:05.350
of the lost pages for us to find.

12:06.624 --> 12:08.593
You know, he may have found a
way to open the rift!

12:08.693 --> 12:10.462
Ah... rift?

12:12.084 --> 12:13.999
I've been in rifts before
and it never ends well.

12:14.099 --> 12:16.701
Not like this one.

12:16.801 --> 12:18.103
We believe it's a mystic passage

12:18.203 --> 12:20.105
between the human sphere
and the dead lands.

12:20.205 --> 12:22.007
Whatever comes next,

12:22.107 --> 12:23.808
I promise Gary's death
will not have been in vain!

12:23.908 --> 12:25.910
Oh, Power Ranger, tone it down, man.

12:26.011 --> 12:26.911
Nobody's even watchin'.

12:27.012 --> 12:28.246
You don't understand.

12:28.346 --> 12:29.982
If Gary found a way to open the rift,

12:30.082 --> 12:31.516
then you can enter the other realm

12:31.616 --> 12:34.519
and lead us in eternal
battle against evil.

12:34.619 --> 12:36.388
Hey, you know what?
That sounds like a ball.

12:36.488 --> 12:38.556
I don't really do the eternal thing.

12:38.656 --> 12:40.825
I'm fifty something, you know years old.

12:40.925 --> 12:42.827
Why don't you just move on without me.

12:42.927 --> 12:44.196
Yo! <i>Jefe</i> ? You down here?

12:44.259 --> 12:45.275
Pablo!

12:45.300 --> 12:46.306
So much has happened since I last saw...

12:46.331 --> 12:48.400
- Oh, shit!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...

12:48.500 --> 12:50.969
It's okay, that's my trusty sidekick.

12:52.704 --> 12:54.006
Hey.

12:54.839 --> 12:55.940
Hey.

12:56.041 --> 12:59.111
Uh, what is going on?
Who are all these people?

12:59.211 --> 13:00.912
And what are you guys
doing in this weird cellar

13:01.013 --> 13:02.747
that I never knew you had?

13:02.847 --> 13:04.482
Uh, not much, so far.

13:04.582 --> 13:07.085
I think these guys flunked Sumerian 101.

13:08.987 --> 13:11.689
Oh, shit!

13:45.723 --> 13:49.161
What the fuck!

13:49.261 --> 13:51.429
I gave you a chance to join me,

13:51.529 --> 13:54.199
to fight a war you could actually win.

13:54.299 --> 13:57.602
Yeah, well, that's still a hard pass.

14:09.147 --> 14:11.383
Do you know what evil is, Kelly?

14:12.884 --> 14:15.287
It's power without fear,

14:16.621 --> 14:18.523
without guilt,

14:24.729 --> 14:26.331
and without pain.

14:26.431 --> 14:29.201
Don't you ever shut the fuck up?

14:51.156 --> 14:53.525
Last chance, Kelly.

14:53.625 --> 14:56.161
Leave now and I might let you live.

14:56.261 --> 14:58.763
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

14:58.863 --> 15:00.598
Fuck that.

15:02.200 --> 15:04.402
Evil murdered my mother.

15:04.502 --> 15:09.006
I watched a fork
go through my father's skull.

15:09.107 --> 15:10.542
I know it's impossible for a demonic

15:10.642 --> 15:13.044
piece of shit like you to understand,

15:13.145 --> 15:15.380
but us humans?

15:15.480 --> 15:18.583
We get attached to people we love.

15:18.683 --> 15:21.553
And when they get fucked over,
we want revenge.

15:23.188 --> 15:25.823
And I ain't leaving 'til I get mine.

15:27.459 --> 15:29.294
It's gladiator time, bitch.

15:31.196 --> 15:33.198
Works for me.

15:48.846 --> 15:52.717
<i>Gu musen ud,</i>

15:59.291 --> 16:02.054
My God, he's deciphering
the incantation!

16:03.648 --> 16:06.471
<i>kandar...</i>

16:06.571 --> 16:08.506
Zoe, look!

16:12.244 --> 16:13.545
Oh, my God! The rift.

16:15.946 --> 16:17.782
He's found a way to open it!

16:17.882 --> 16:19.055
He better not! Pablo!

16:19.118 --> 16:20.752
Get the hell away from that wall!

16:25.757 --> 16:28.226
You had to pick today
to learn a new language?

16:28.326 --> 16:29.527
I don't know what came over me.

16:29.627 --> 16:32.397
All of a sudden I just... knew.

16:32.497 --> 16:34.532
All right, boys, this is it!

16:34.632 --> 16:35.633
We're going in!

16:38.336 --> 16:40.538
I got a bad feeling about this.

16:40.638 --> 16:41.639
I got this.

16:41.739 --> 16:43.107
Hey, boys and girls, me personally,

16:43.207 --> 16:44.276
I've saved the world enough.

16:44.376 --> 16:47.679
- But but none of this works without you.
- What I'm saying is,

16:47.779 --> 16:49.614
I'm the only Prophesied One you got.

16:49.714 --> 16:52.183
You're not gonna try me
on some Hail Mary move, are ya?

16:52.284 --> 16:53.651
He may be right.

16:53.751 --> 16:55.553
Okay! See? Good.

16:55.653 --> 16:56.854
Take a break, crack a few...

16:56.954 --> 16:58.723
One of us should go first.
A reconnaissance!

16:58.823 --> 16:59.991
That's not what I was talking about.

17:00.091 --> 17:01.125
You're right, Marcus.

17:01.225 --> 17:02.927
- Good luck.
- I'll be back soon.

17:07.031 --> 17:10.001
<i>Gu musen ud,</i>

17:12.361 --> 17:14.939

17:48.906 --> 17:49.974
Marcus?!

18:07.258 --> 18:08.626
Oh.

18:16.067 --> 18:17.935
So much potential.

18:19.671 --> 18:21.473
Now you're just gonna bleed out here

18:21.573 --> 18:23.475
on this nasty old woman's carpet?

18:27.845 --> 18:29.847
What a waste.

18:52.203 --> 18:54.439
Does it hurt?

19:23.200 --> 19:25.069
I hated you least of all Kelly.

19:52.834 --> 19:54.466
Something's not right.

19:56.805 --> 19:58.307
I've just got a bad feeling.

19:58.736 --> 20:00.404
<i>Jefe</i> ?

20:00.505 --> 20:02.907
You ain't the only one.

20:03.007 --> 20:05.577
I've got a seriously demon vibe
from this joker!

20:05.677 --> 20:07.779
Marcus! What did you see?

20:07.879 --> 20:09.781
Help me up...

20:14.185 --> 20:15.887
Thank you, Peter.

20:17.524 --> 20:19.259
We Knights stick together, right?

20:26.230 --> 20:27.899
Marcus?!

20:31.894 --> 20:32.904
Peter!

20:42.413 --> 20:43.648
Oh!

20:59.531 --> 21:01.032
Sorry, man.

21:13.244 --> 21:14.646
Aww!

21:16.313 --> 21:18.182
Can't just kill the guy!

21:20.718 --> 21:23.120
Back off circus freak.

21:23.220 --> 21:25.222
You're next.

21:38.402 --> 21:39.704
Join us.

21:39.804 --> 21:41.806
No, I'm good. I joined the Elks.

21:50.215 --> 21:51.261
Kaya.

21:51.314 --> 21:52.341
Ruby.

21:52.366 --> 21:53.911
The rift has been opened.

21:55.810 --> 21:57.479
Then we don't have much time.

21:59.489 --> 22:02.024
I have a vessel.

22:02.359 --> 22:03.747
She brought me the dagger.

22:03.864 --> 22:05.840
And died by its blade.

22:05.880 --> 22:07.315
The darkness is in her.

22:26.906 --> 22:30.876
<i>Kandar roi est char Kaya.</i>

22:43.051 --> 22:45.153
I'm here.

22:46.654 --> 22:50.425
Ruby, the Dark Ones know about the rift.

22:50.525 --> 22:53.628
We need to find it before they get out.

22:53.728 --> 22:56.030
You help me drive
Ash's daughter over the edge

22:56.131 --> 22:58.300
and we won't have to.

23:06.308 --> 23:07.809
Ooh.

23:30.632 --> 23:32.066
Ah!

23:36.304 --> 23:38.206
Time to suck a little saw.

23:57.929 --> 24:00.412
Am I the only one fighting this asshole?

24:07.787 --> 24:10.890
Go back to hell you
Siamese son of a bitch!

24:26.371 --> 24:30.275
And that is how you kill a demon.

24:30.375 --> 24:31.744
It's not as easy as it looks.

24:31.844 --> 24:36.516
My God, they're all dead.

24:36.616 --> 24:38.150
Welcome to my world, lady.

24:38.250 --> 24:40.252
Shit just got really weird.

24:40.352 --> 24:42.655
That thing is sick.

24:42.755 --> 24:44.757
And I think some more
demons want to come out.

24:44.857 --> 24:46.492
I was afraid you were gonna say that.

24:46.560 --> 24:47.597
You better hang on to those pages.

24:47.667 --> 24:48.994
Pablo you gotta find a way

24:49.094 --> 24:52.480
to shut down this demonic
poop chute once and for all.

24:52.558 --> 24:54.834
Wish I could stay but I have to
get back to my lovely daughter.

25:08.699 --> 25:10.746
Brandy!

25:10.785 --> 25:11.884
It's Pop!

25:11.984 --> 25:13.018
Dad!

25:13.118 --> 25:14.787
I was so worried.

25:14.887 --> 25:16.522
Whoa, again?

25:16.622 --> 25:17.823
Yeah, you know what they say kiddo.

25:17.923 --> 25:20.192
A demon fighter's work is never done.

25:20.292 --> 25:22.795
So I've heard.

25:22.895 --> 25:24.496
Kelly!

25:24.597 --> 25:25.899
Where have you been?

25:25.969 --> 25:27.626
Looking for you quite honestly.

25:29.602 --> 25:32.371
What is that smell?

25:32.471 --> 25:34.473
Pop Tarts.

25:34.574 --> 25:35.675
You want one?

25:35.775 --> 25:36.942
Does the Pope shit in the woods?

25:37.042 --> 25:39.945
- I'll make two.
- Hah. Toast it like last time.

25:45.517 --> 25:47.219
Son of a bitch, you found it.

25:47.319 --> 25:48.988
Lucky us.

25:49.088 --> 25:50.956
It was buried right where we thought.

25:53.325 --> 25:55.260
Good work, Kelly.

25:55.360 --> 25:57.096
This changes everything.

25:59.599 --> 26:01.601
Yes, it does.
