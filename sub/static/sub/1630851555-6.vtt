WEBVTT

00:07.048 --> 00:09.467
The cab had to leave. I paid him.

00:09.551 --> 00:11.052
No problem. Víctor will take you.

00:11.136 --> 00:12.721
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:15.098 --> 00:16.016
Where to, Miss?

00:31.114 --> 00:32.282
I'm home, Boss.

00:32.365 --> 00:33.992
I'll call you when I'm done.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.349
Is Simón back already?

02:21.975 --> 02:24.519
Víctor took some clothes to his office.

02:27.355 --> 02:30.567
Gracie, did I say a lot of crazy things
last night?

02:31.317 --> 02:33.403
The last thing I remember is

02:33.486 --> 02:36.823
I took my wedding photo album
to the garden.

02:36.906 --> 02:39.701
No, my child. You said nothing crazy.

02:39.784 --> 02:42.495
And don't worry.
The photos are back where they belong.

03:00.555 --> 03:03.016
I just filed the report as I promised.

03:05.852 --> 03:09.731
They'll call me
when they have news about Manny.

03:13.109 --> 03:18.156
Susana, could your daughter be involved
with some dangerous people?

03:18.740 --> 03:19.574
Well…

03:20.992 --> 03:23.494
Manny owes some money in Spain.

03:24.078 --> 03:25.622
-I see.
-A lot.

03:25.705 --> 03:26.748
Right.

03:26.831 --> 03:30.293
But I don't think
they know she's here in Mexico.

03:31.794 --> 03:34.130
But I don't know what contacts they have.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.048
Right.

03:36.132 --> 03:39.177
-I don't even want to think…
-Don't worry about it.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.346
I'm here.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.523
Fine. I'd better leave.

03:59.739 --> 04:03.201
If Manny is in trouble,
she might try to fool you.

04:03.284 --> 04:04.118
Fool me?

04:04.202 --> 04:08.289
Yes, call you asking you
to get her some money, or…

04:09.791 --> 04:12.252
Or make up stories to scare you.

04:12.335 --> 04:15.255
She'd never do something like that.

04:15.338 --> 04:16.965
Only if they're threatening her.

04:18.675 --> 04:22.595
All I ask is if she sends you
another note, or phones you,

04:22.679 --> 04:24.305
please call me first.

04:24.389 --> 04:25.431
I will.

04:28.101 --> 04:28.935
Okay.

05:07.473 --> 05:09.350
We identified the guy in the photo,

05:09.434 --> 05:14.230
who before being a mayor in Yucatán,
was arrested during the Jiutepec case.

05:17.275 --> 05:19.694
So Ana sacrificed herself for nothing?

05:21.070 --> 05:24.699
Where are the other bastards?
Are they deputies, senators?

05:25.366 --> 05:28.911
All bigwigs, I think we'll catch
the biggest one in Mexico.

05:36.377 --> 05:38.296
Sorry. I have to go.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.214
All yours.

05:41.674 --> 05:46.012
We're celebrating a colleague's birthday
at the bar where Matilde sings.

05:46.095 --> 05:48.556
-I can't.
-How about a movie tomorrow?

05:48.639 --> 05:49.474
Sorry.

06:01.861 --> 06:05.114
-Why is my mom on a different floor?
-I'll be right there.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.284
-I want to see her.
-In a few days.

06:08.368 --> 06:12.121
Dr. Zapata is researching a new drug
for cases like Alice's.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.373
That's all.

06:13.456 --> 06:16.751
He's had very promising results
with other patients.

06:16.834 --> 06:18.044
That's good news.

06:18.753 --> 06:19.921
Really? For whom?

06:20.797 --> 06:23.549
Nobody asked if I wanted my mom
to be transferred.

06:23.633 --> 06:26.052
The foundation makes those decisions.

06:26.135 --> 06:30.181
Why the foundation?
I am her daughter, damn it!

06:34.894 --> 06:37.146
-It's very possible that…
-It's so good that…

06:37.605 --> 06:40.233
Don't say another word. And you?

06:40.316 --> 06:45.238
She tells you everything you need,
and then what? Bye, right?

06:45.321 --> 06:49.283
And if Chango comes and kills her,
tough luck, right?

06:49.867 --> 06:50.785
Are you okay?

06:50.868 --> 06:53.204
No, I'm not okay,
I'm sick and tired of people

06:53.287 --> 06:56.624
who think they can do
whatever they want to women.

06:56.707 --> 06:57.708
Caridad!

06:57.792 --> 07:02.588
No, from now on, go out there
and get your own information.

07:03.297 --> 07:06.259
Aren't you the great detective? Then go!

07:06.342 --> 07:09.637
That's enough, I told him to come over
when he had something.

07:11.180 --> 07:12.765
I'm fed up of running.

07:13.724 --> 07:15.435
I want them to catch the scumbags.

07:23.526 --> 07:26.779
Fifteen thousand dollars
at today's exchange rate

07:26.863 --> 07:29.282
from your investment account, Cati?

07:29.365 --> 07:32.368
That's right.
15,000 in cash, please, Pedrito.

07:33.536 --> 07:34.787
I'm sure there's enough.

07:35.538 --> 07:39.000
Yes, there's enough,
but there's a $200,000 withdrawal.

07:39.083 --> 07:40.585
Two hundred thousand?

07:44.464 --> 07:46.841
Right. Recently, right?

07:46.924 --> 07:49.427
Yes, at the end of last week.

07:50.636 --> 07:51.471
Exactly.

07:55.016 --> 07:57.935
We're doing our job.
There's no need to be rude or push us.

07:58.019 --> 07:59.562
There's no need to push us.

08:02.773 --> 08:05.943
When will we know something?
It's been months now.

08:06.027 --> 08:07.111
It's not up to me.

08:07.195 --> 08:10.239
The Senate has to appoint
the new Justice Minister.

08:10.323 --> 08:13.284
Can you at least tell us what to expect?

08:13.367 --> 08:17.872
All I can say is if Simón Marroquín
is elected as many think he'll be,

08:17.955 --> 08:20.082
I wouldn't get my hopes up.

08:20.166 --> 08:23.169
-Why not?
-Have a nice day.

08:24.921 --> 08:25.755
Thanks.

08:41.938 --> 08:42.772
Caridad.

08:43.814 --> 08:45.316
I'm not using Teresa.

08:46.567 --> 08:47.985
I'd never put her in danger.

08:49.403 --> 08:50.238
I know.

08:53.824 --> 08:55.576
You're not the problem.

08:57.119 --> 08:59.830
It's other people.

09:06.504 --> 09:07.338
Sorry.

09:10.258 --> 09:11.884
If I can help in any way…

09:13.344 --> 09:16.556
My entire life has been about praying,

09:17.723 --> 09:21.769
baking cakes, visiting the sick,
praying some more.

09:24.855 --> 09:27.400
Always protected within these walls.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.195
Life isn't necessarily better out there.

09:32.488 --> 09:33.322
Trust me.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.824
How would I know?

09:36.659 --> 09:39.161
Peeking through my window at the convent?

09:42.206 --> 09:45.084
There's a birthday party this evening.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.961
A table for a party of three, fine.

10:30.838 --> 10:31.672
See you later.

10:33.257 --> 10:35.259
Hi. What are you doing here?

10:36.135 --> 10:37.970
I'm invited to a birthday party.

10:38.054 --> 10:38.888
Really?

10:39.639 --> 10:40.473
Whose?

10:43.559 --> 10:44.393
Hi.

10:47.188 --> 10:50.983
Daniel is the owner and this is Lorenzo.

10:51.067 --> 10:52.068
Nice to meet you.

10:52.151 --> 10:54.278
-Welcome, Lorenzo.
-Thanks.

10:55.112 --> 10:57.114
-Make yourselves at home.
-Thanks.

11:54.922 --> 11:57.675
-You're a great dancer.
-Thank you.

11:57.758 --> 11:59.677
Way to move your butt, baby.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.263
You bastard.

12:05.433 --> 12:06.308
What a jerk!

12:13.315 --> 12:17.737
-What's up, Benny?
-How are you, sir? Welcome.

12:17.820 --> 12:21.157
-Is Manny available?
-Jeez! She's not here.

12:21.240 --> 12:24.034
Damn! But it's Thursday, dude.

12:24.118 --> 12:28.080
I know, but she called in sick.
Nina's available.

12:28.956 --> 12:29.957
Damn it!

12:31.751 --> 12:34.503
-Are we leaving, sir?
-No. It's no big deal.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.381
Come in. Please go with him.

12:39.175 --> 12:42.595
Suárez is using lounge 2 with Nina.
No cameras.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.598
-How are you?
-Fine.

12:50.144 --> 12:51.979
That punk Manny isn't sick, dude.

12:53.314 --> 12:56.484
She stopped coming one day
and just vanished.

12:56.567 --> 12:57.985
Is Manny the Dominican?

12:58.944 --> 13:00.237
No, the Mexican, dude.

13:01.155 --> 13:05.409
The one with a Spanish accent
because she lived in Spain, remember?

13:05.493 --> 13:07.787
-Right! She's Manny?
-Right.

13:08.496 --> 13:11.457
I saw her do a pole dance once,
and the woman is…

13:12.875 --> 13:15.503
-Who is she?
-Hey! That's my cousin.

13:21.550 --> 13:22.384
Hey.

13:24.178 --> 13:25.095
Hey.

13:25.679 --> 13:28.599
Why not? Am I too ugly for you or what?

13:29.183 --> 13:31.852
First, you're not ugly, you're hideous.

13:31.936 --> 13:37.399
Second, I'd never date a guy like you.
And third, you make me sick.

13:43.239 --> 13:45.032
Careful, Pocho! Stop!

13:45.866 --> 13:47.535
Stop, Pocho!

13:48.702 --> 13:52.790
-You want a piece of me?
-Stop! I'm taking both of you jerks in.

13:55.334 --> 13:56.794
Pocho!

13:57.419 --> 13:58.295
Pocho.

14:04.510 --> 14:05.344
Are you okay?

14:07.096 --> 14:08.764
What did I say about the real world?

14:11.809 --> 14:12.810
Cheers.

14:16.939 --> 14:17.982
It has to be here!

14:37.459 --> 14:38.419
What is this?

14:39.628 --> 14:41.046
I think it's here.

14:43.841 --> 14:47.344
Give me a break.
We'd get five broads for 20,000 pesos.

14:48.178 --> 14:50.389
Those two bitches think I'm dumb.

14:51.098 --> 14:54.560
The woman whose neck you bruised
knows who you are.

14:55.394 --> 14:58.856
Pay them and forget it.
You can't take any risks for 30 days.

15:00.316 --> 15:01.817
Damn it! You pay them.

15:10.367 --> 15:11.785
I ran out of tequila.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.914
Can you lend me some?

15:15.414 --> 15:16.248
For today.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.292
Tomorrow.

15:45.027 --> 15:47.988
There are smarter ways
to put a jerk in his place.

15:48.072 --> 15:50.074
Violence doesn't solve everything.

15:51.450 --> 15:53.285
Is he violent with you too?

15:53.369 --> 15:58.248
No. Pocho? He worships me.
He tells me so every day.

15:58.332 --> 16:00.209
I won't cancel your contract.

16:01.418 --> 16:04.129
But you can't play today.

16:04.213 --> 16:06.423
Pocho needs to learn a lesson.

16:06.840 --> 16:07.675
Yes.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.427
It won't happen again.

16:12.304 --> 16:13.138
Matilde.

16:14.765 --> 16:17.059
If Pocho ever gets violent with you,

16:17.142 --> 16:20.270
or you feel uncomfortable,
you're welcome at my place.

16:20.354 --> 16:22.231
There's an extra room.

16:29.613 --> 16:31.699
We've got a great product, Uncle.

16:32.449 --> 16:35.744
All we need now is the cash
to get it going.

16:35.828 --> 16:39.915
I'll give you the details
if you come over this month as you said.

16:40.541 --> 16:42.459
I guess Simón doesn't know about this?

16:42.543 --> 16:45.587
He has no idea I'm brewing a craft beer.

16:46.171 --> 16:48.257
How have you financed it so far?

16:49.341 --> 16:50.843
Mom is a genius.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.638
How is Catalina?

16:57.182 --> 16:58.100
Fine.

16:58.183 --> 17:02.354
I planned on flying to Mexico City
and back on Saturday,

17:02.438 --> 17:05.399
but I can stay until Monday
to try your beer.

17:05.482 --> 17:07.735
Sure, just say when and where.

17:07.818 --> 17:12.072
I like the name "Woman of Courage."
Where did you get it?

17:12.656 --> 17:15.075
It's about this girl I met.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.786
I might even introduce her to you.

18:00.287 --> 18:01.580
-Let's go.
-Wait.

18:01.663 --> 18:04.416
-That's not a question, Juana, now!
-Wait!

18:35.072 --> 18:36.240
Sorry.

19:00.889 --> 19:04.017
ACTRESS NICTÉ MAI
DIES IN TRAGIC ACCIDENT

19:06.353 --> 19:09.439
FROM: GREGORIO ROBLES
FOUNDATION LINKED TO CONACULTA

19:16.155 --> 19:17.072
Is Vale here?

19:20.617 --> 19:22.119
She said she'd be back late.

19:23.871 --> 19:24.705
What is it?

19:25.747 --> 19:27.416
I need to crash somewhere.

19:28.083 --> 19:31.503
I can't sleep with the Sacred Heart
judging me.

19:33.547 --> 19:35.382
I don't know why I kissed him.

19:36.758 --> 19:40.345
Because you're a normal girl
who likes to have fun sometimes.

19:42.222 --> 19:43.390
Just like my mom.

19:44.850 --> 19:47.936
That didn't work too well for her, did it?

19:49.313 --> 19:51.481
You kissed a guy. That's all.

19:56.820 --> 19:57.988
Was it your first time?

20:03.493 --> 20:05.996
My first kiss was when I was 12.

20:06.079 --> 20:08.957
I still remember how ecstatic I felt.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.543
How does it feel at your age?

20:14.463 --> 20:17.841
Once, the Pope came to Mexico.

20:19.092 --> 20:22.262
And I saw him. I met him personally.

20:23.513 --> 20:27.226
I thought my heart
would jump out of my chest

20:28.018 --> 20:31.355
and my knees were shaking.

20:33.023 --> 20:37.152
Mother Elena says going to heaven
feels just like that.

20:40.948 --> 20:43.784
The poor woman
has obviously never been kissed.

20:54.586 --> 20:58.006
That's part of what you deal with
if you sing in a bar.

20:58.674 --> 20:59.883
You know that, Pochi.

21:00.592 --> 21:03.011
I'd kick his ass
if it weren't for that cop.

21:04.763 --> 21:08.058
You didn't have to defend me.
I put him in his place.

21:09.226 --> 21:10.727
I wasn't defending you.

21:10.811 --> 21:13.438
The moron tried to make fun of me.

21:14.147 --> 21:15.148
And you too.

21:15.232 --> 21:16.191
No, I…

21:16.275 --> 21:17.734
You are my wife.

21:18.610 --> 21:21.530
This won't happen again. Got it?

21:22.739 --> 21:23.824
Got it?

21:32.958 --> 21:35.794
Lorenzo is just a friend.
He can kiss anyone he likes.

21:36.461 --> 21:40.299
-He's in love with you.
-You're the only one that doesn't know.

21:40.799 --> 21:43.302
That would explain so many things.

21:44.970 --> 21:49.266
Oh, no! I need to get back to the convent
or they'll know I didn't sleep there.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.268
Have you seen my purse?

21:52.936 --> 21:56.231
Caridad, if you want to move in
for a while,

21:56.315 --> 21:59.276
one Juana more or less, no problem,
you're welcome.

22:04.489 --> 22:06.074
So, Federico's your guy?

22:06.867 --> 22:09.244
Federico, no last name.

22:09.953 --> 22:15.292
Because our sister's been too busy
with other issues,

22:15.375 --> 22:17.336
to ask what his last name is.

22:17.419 --> 22:20.130
What can I say? Don't you work today?

22:20.213 --> 22:22.799
-I don't have any clients.
-See you later.

22:23.633 --> 22:27.471
Valentina, I forgot to tell you
Gregorio e-mailed you yesterday.

22:27.554 --> 22:28.805
It seemed important.

22:28.889 --> 22:31.558
I'll check it out
when I come back to change.

22:32.476 --> 22:33.602
I'm glad you came.

22:33.685 --> 22:37.189
I had to get out of the apartment
for a couple of hours.

22:37.272 --> 22:38.440
Right.

22:39.566 --> 22:42.361
Speaking about something
other than Manny, helps.

22:43.487 --> 22:44.488
How are you?

22:46.031 --> 22:49.451
I think Simón is cheating on me.

22:51.328 --> 22:52.287
Why?

22:52.371 --> 22:56.249
Besides not remembering
the last time he touched me,

22:56.333 --> 22:57.834
it wouldn't be the first time.

22:58.460 --> 23:00.379
But this time it's like…

23:02.089 --> 23:03.673
This time it's like what?

23:06.343 --> 23:08.178
Cata, you can tell me anything.

23:08.762 --> 23:12.182
He withdrew 200,000 dollars
without telling me.

23:12.933 --> 23:14.393
That's never happened before.

23:15.435 --> 23:16.937
Can't there be another reason?

23:17.020 --> 23:19.106
It could be some dirty business,

23:19.189 --> 23:22.442
but not now
with his nomination as minister.

23:22.526 --> 23:24.736
It's another woman,
but he overdid it this time.

23:25.404 --> 23:28.740
It's a deposit for an apartment,
or jewelry, who knows?

23:31.576 --> 23:33.286
-I'm so sorry, Cata.
-I'm not.

23:34.329 --> 23:37.040
Now I can leave him after he's appointed.

23:39.126 --> 23:41.128
It's been 26 years, Susi.

23:41.753 --> 23:46.591
Twenty-six years of not complaining
and I think I deserve to be happy.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.553
Right? I think it's my turn.

23:53.056 --> 23:55.725
You're such a jackass! And you!

23:57.185 --> 23:58.770
What are you? A rookie?

24:00.355 --> 24:03.733
I had it under control,
but that damn woman…

24:03.817 --> 24:07.279
That damn woman is smarter
than both of you put together.

24:09.030 --> 24:12.951
How many houses are near Simón's
in Valle de Bravo?

24:13.034 --> 24:15.871
How many? At least half a dozen.

24:16.371 --> 24:20.709
Nobody saw a thing, boss.
They all know me. They would've asked.

24:20.792 --> 24:24.463
She'd screw me over if she wanted.
She vanished five days ago.

24:24.546 --> 24:27.007
Maybe she took off for good.

24:27.674 --> 24:28.842
With 5,000 dollars?

24:29.676 --> 24:31.720
After losing 200 grand?

24:31.803 --> 24:34.431
If she does, she'll have to admit
she blackmailed me.

24:35.557 --> 24:39.644
It's the word of a damn punk
against that of the next Justice Minister.

24:53.033 --> 24:54.242
Is she your kid?

24:55.118 --> 24:57.204
Not without a DNA test.

24:58.288 --> 24:59.915
Is she your kid or not, damn it?

25:01.500 --> 25:02.334
Simón!

25:04.419 --> 25:06.796
There's too much at stake
with your appointment.

25:09.049 --> 25:10.550
I hope Víctor is right.

25:12.719 --> 25:14.471
And the damn punk never comes back.

25:15.096 --> 25:16.139
Get lost.

25:17.641 --> 25:19.893
My next meeting is much more important.

26:08.817 --> 26:10.819
KETAMINE - FLUNITRAZEPAM

26:16.074 --> 26:18.577
I'm glad you'll be with your sisters.

26:19.536 --> 26:21.746
But don't forget us.

26:22.289 --> 26:23.123
How could I?

26:24.708 --> 26:26.126
You are my family.

26:27.294 --> 26:30.297
I'll keep coming to the shelter
to help all I can.

26:31.840 --> 26:32.882
And Alice?

26:35.552 --> 26:39.097
I don't know how,
but I'm taking her out of there.

26:39.180 --> 26:40.890
I know she can still recover.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.019
She's welcome here too if need be.

26:44.686 --> 26:45.520
Thanks.

26:49.316 --> 26:51.735
Thanks for looking after me.

26:52.736 --> 26:55.614
And everything you did for my mom.

26:56.573 --> 26:57.407
Caridad.

26:59.284 --> 27:00.493
When I took my vows…

27:02.495 --> 27:06.207
the toughest part was missing
any chance I had of giving birth.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.502
But God brought you here.

27:10.837 --> 27:14.883
And watching you grow up
was one of my greatest joys ever.

27:17.594 --> 27:19.054
You'll always be my daughter.

27:28.063 --> 27:29.856
You look great in all of them.

27:30.899 --> 27:35.111
And you won't be dressed for long anyway.

27:35.737 --> 27:39.115
Why am I so tense?
This never happens with other guys.

27:40.283 --> 27:41.826
Federico must be special.

27:44.037 --> 27:47.540
It's as if we communicate
without saying a word.

27:48.124 --> 27:51.378
It's weird, as if I already knew him.

27:52.045 --> 27:53.880
When we reincarnate,

27:53.963 --> 27:57.884
we meet the same people
we were attached to in other lives.

27:58.927 --> 28:01.805
In our previous life,
they could've been siblings,

28:01.888 --> 28:05.475
a grandparent and a grandchild,
or mother and child.

28:08.144 --> 28:11.731
Could you check out Gregorio's e-mail?
It might be important.

28:11.815 --> 28:15.527
There might be something we can use
to help Caridad with Alice.

28:16.319 --> 28:17.320
Okay?

28:24.452 --> 28:26.788
Hey. What is it?

28:28.123 --> 28:28.957
Nothing.

28:30.709 --> 28:33.712
Just don't drink too much tonight, okay?

28:35.547 --> 28:36.464
Yes, Mom.

28:37.507 --> 28:40.427
Camilo, my uncle's very interested.

28:40.510 --> 28:42.762
Our lives might change this weekend.

28:43.513 --> 28:44.556
Move, you idiot!

28:46.391 --> 28:49.185
That's great news, dude.

28:49.269 --> 28:54.399
That cousin of yours
whose photo you showed me,

28:54.482 --> 28:56.568
she looks familiar, dude.

28:56.651 --> 28:57.736
Who? Manny?

28:58.236 --> 29:01.406
We haven't heard from her in days.
Have you seen her?

29:01.489 --> 29:04.576
She's a half Mexican,
half Spanish bartender.

29:06.745 --> 29:09.038
No, I must be mistaken.

29:11.332 --> 29:13.626
-Talk to you later, dude.
-Bye.

29:17.756 --> 29:18.673
Great.

29:24.721 --> 29:27.265
Hey! Wake up!

29:27.348 --> 29:29.726
Sorry, sir. How did your meeting go?

29:30.226 --> 29:31.060
What was that?

29:32.604 --> 29:34.063
How did your meeting go?

29:36.316 --> 29:40.069
Great. They gave me the aquarium, dude!

29:46.910 --> 29:49.913
-Good evening.
-I'd like a glass of your red wine.

29:49.996 --> 29:50.830
Coming up.

29:50.914 --> 29:56.461
DEPUTY CORTÉS BACKS REFORM
OF ABUSE VICTIMS PROTECTION LAW

30:03.301 --> 30:04.135
Hello.

30:04.219 --> 30:08.473
Sorry, had I known the entire nation
was coming to Mexico City,

30:08.556 --> 30:10.683
I would've left Puebla at 8:00.

30:11.392 --> 30:12.477
Are you at the hotel?

30:13.186 --> 30:14.312
I just got here.

30:14.395 --> 30:16.773
I'm having a glass of wine at the bar.

30:17.398 --> 30:21.194
The suite has an amazing view
in case you want to check in.

30:21.277 --> 30:23.863
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

30:23.947 --> 30:27.700
I think I'll have to go upstairs
and jump in the tub.

30:28.368 --> 30:29.369
All by myself.

30:29.452 --> 30:31.830
Make that 15 minutes instead of 30.

30:31.913 --> 30:35.542
Even if it means leaving the car
and running over. Move it!

30:37.335 --> 30:38.169
Bye.

30:54.310 --> 30:57.564
Caridad, a lady's here to see you.

30:58.982 --> 31:01.025
She won't speak with anyone but you.

31:02.735 --> 31:04.821
-Hi.
-Hi.

31:04.904 --> 31:07.866
-I'm Valentina de la Paz.
-One moment, please.

31:10.076 --> 31:13.580
Mr. Federico Marroquín
registered your name, Miss.

31:14.956 --> 31:15.957
Marroquín.

31:36.394 --> 31:37.228
Hi.

31:38.688 --> 31:39.647
I am Caridad.

31:40.231 --> 31:41.900
You're safe here.

32:07.508 --> 32:12.013
VALENTINA, I CAN'T WAIT TO BE WITH YOU.
FEDERICO.

32:12.096 --> 32:13.264
What's your name?

32:14.557 --> 32:15.475
Juana.

32:26.986 --> 32:29.238
I'm not repeating myself, Caridad.

32:29.322 --> 32:30.573
Do as I say.

32:30.657 --> 32:32.492
Don't order me around, Manny.

32:32.575 --> 32:36.120
Tell me why you're here,
or I'm not calling anyone.

32:36.621 --> 32:38.498
I fled because they tried to kill me.

32:38.581 --> 32:41.751
You mentioned the women's shelter
and I lost my phone.

32:42.460 --> 32:43.503
Who?

32:44.837 --> 32:45.672
Our dad.

32:51.469 --> 32:52.303
Hello.

32:52.387 --> 32:54.263
Bautista, it's me, Caridad.

32:54.347 --> 32:57.266
All four of us need to meet here
at the convent.

32:57.350 --> 32:58.309
Manny's here.

32:58.935 --> 33:00.728
Manny? But how?

33:00.812 --> 33:03.147
She'll only talk when we're together.

33:03.231 --> 33:05.650
But she knows who our dad is.

33:06.401 --> 33:08.111
His name is Simón Marroquín.

33:10.655 --> 33:14.784
Memories come back, you know.
I remember everything, Simón.

33:16.244 --> 33:17.662
Are you there, Bautista?

33:19.956 --> 33:23.084
-Yes.
-Tell Valentina. I'll call Matilde.

33:23.167 --> 33:26.963
Please be very careful.
She says we're in danger.

33:28.214 --> 33:29.549
They're watching us.

33:41.227 --> 33:44.147
Mom, if you're checking
if I'm drinking too much…

33:44.230 --> 33:49.027
Val, Manny's at the convent.
She has information about our dad.

33:49.110 --> 33:51.571
-What?
-Yes. Caridad just phoned me.

33:51.654 --> 33:53.031
Do you know who he is?

33:53.114 --> 33:55.616
The guy in the report Gregorio sent you.

33:56.743 --> 33:57.827
He's on my screen.

33:58.327 --> 34:01.581
He's very important.
They just named him something.

34:02.665 --> 34:05.043
And I had another vision of the car crash.

34:05.126 --> 34:07.628
He took off when my Mom was hurt.

34:07.712 --> 34:10.214
-Do you know his name?
-Simón Marroquín.

34:11.883 --> 34:15.428
If Simón Marroquín is elected,
I wouldn't get my hopes up.

34:16.345 --> 34:17.847
I'm researching him.

34:17.930 --> 34:20.349
He's a partner at his dad's law office.

34:20.433 --> 34:23.269
And he worked at Conaculta
when he was young.

34:23.352 --> 34:26.105
Simón Marroquín
is the next Justice Minister.

34:26.939 --> 34:28.149
Is Manny sure?

34:28.232 --> 34:29.484
Caridad thinks so.

34:30.109 --> 34:33.696
He's married and has a son about our age.

34:34.614 --> 34:36.199
What's his son's name?

34:36.783 --> 34:37.784
Federico.

34:38.534 --> 34:41.829
Federico Marroquín
registered your name, Miss.

34:42.663 --> 34:45.583
-Have you got his picture?
-I'll send it to you.

35:22.537 --> 35:23.621
Finally.

35:39.387 --> 35:40.221
Valentina?

37:05.473 --> 37:07.350
