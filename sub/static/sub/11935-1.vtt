00:39.165 --> 00:43.837
No questions about the layout, right?
No questions.

00:47.173 --> 00:49.217
Let's go over this shit again.

00:49.342 --> 00:53.221
They got a small dinger on the door.
I'll get 'em to open it.

00:53.346 --> 00:58.434
Then me and Levine go in. Giolito
and Pederson, block this door.

00:58.560 --> 01:02.313
OK? Rondell and Leppert,
hit the back door.

01:02.438 --> 01:05.149
No problem. It's a piece of cake.

01:05.275 --> 01:10.113
McKee and Cline, you're outside
in case we get some jump-outs...

01:10.196 --> 01:12.740
- Foley.
- Excuse me a sec.

01:14.617 --> 01:16.953
Where in the hell is SWAT?

01:17.078 --> 01:20.081
- Boss, I cancelled the SWAT team.
- You what?

01:20.206 --> 01:23.918
I wouldn't raid
a church bingo game without SWAT.

01:24.043 --> 01:27.547
These guys are carjackers.
They're mechanics.

01:27.672 --> 01:30.758
We don't need SWAT
blowing holes in my evidence.

01:30.884 --> 01:34.470
Besides, they might shoot somebody.
Let's do this.

01:35.597 --> 01:41.019
This is your operation. I'm just
an observer, but I'll be watching.

01:41.144 --> 01:45.398
Just observe how I don't have
to use SWAT, and trust me.

01:46.691 --> 01:51.905
Everybody's ready?
Nobody need to take a nervous piss?

01:52.030 --> 01:54.032
Let's mount up.

02:01.331 --> 02:04.542
This is Dick Burton.
We've got 55 degrees this morning.

02:04.667 --> 02:08.420
Here's Diana Ross and the Supremes,
Come See About Me.

03:00.056 --> 03:01.850
What are you doing?

03:05.353 --> 03:07.146
Bobby, they're here.

03:50.899 --> 03:52.692
Any trouble with the hijack?

03:52.817 --> 03:55.570
- Right where you said.
- Piece of cake.

03:55.695 --> 03:58.031
- Anybody hurt?
- No.

03:58.156 --> 04:02.118
Good. I don't like to see
people unnecessarily injured.

04:02.243 --> 04:04.829
Nobody got hurt, boss.

04:05.997 --> 04:09.375
- Keys?
- Ain't yours till we see money.

04:09.501 --> 04:11.503
I just want to look in the back.

04:34.526 --> 04:37.820
- Where's our money?
- Pay him.

05:35.795 --> 05:38.214
You think we should have used SWAT?

05:38.339 --> 05:42.135
- Fuck SWAT.
- That's what I say. Fuck SWAT.

05:51.978 --> 05:55.565
- Some guy. What should I do?
- Kill him.

05:59.736 --> 06:04.073
How you doing? Is this the illegal
chop shop where they chop up cars?

06:04.199 --> 06:09.829
I got my wife's Buick. I want it
chopped, the bitch ain't been right.

06:12.248 --> 06:13.541
Go, go, go!

06:20.840 --> 06:22.800
Go!

06:34.437 --> 06:36.439
They got fucking machineguns.

06:45.406 --> 06:48.952
- You said they had no guns!
- They must have changed their view.

06:54.499 --> 06:56.876
Get the 12-gauge.

07:33.663 --> 07:35.665
We should've called SWAT.

07:38.084 --> 07:40.378
Police! Hands in the air!

07:42.130 --> 07:45.466
Move it! Go! Go!

07:50.180 --> 07:51.806
What the...?

07:59.898 --> 08:01.941
Daniel, come on!

08:25.173 --> 08:27.467
Cover me. I'm going in with Todd.

09:06.548 --> 09:09.467
Axel, you on a coffee break?

09:11.761 --> 09:14.013
Go get that son of a bitch.

09:22.730 --> 09:27.110
Boss. Hey, man! Shit!

10:07.692 --> 10:09.527
We got a tail.

10:10.695 --> 10:12.989
Wax that clown.

10:59.536 --> 11:01.329
God damn it!

11:12.340 --> 11:14.133
Help me, man.

12:07.729 --> 12:10.773
Police officer!
Trying to catch a killer. Move it!

12:10.899 --> 12:14.319
- Get out of my way! I'm a cop!
- Take it easy.

12:14.444 --> 12:17.322
Get the fuck out of here,
all right?

12:22.452 --> 12:27.999
Thank you. My name's Steve Fulbright.
Could I see some ID, please?

12:28.124 --> 12:32.879
I am a Detroit police officer.
My name is Axel... Where's my shit?

12:33.004 --> 12:37.592
I'm a police officer chasing
a killer who's getting away now.

12:37.717 --> 12:40.011
- We know.
- You know what?

12:40.136 --> 12:42.680
We know.

12:42.805 --> 12:47.769
What's happened is you're in the
middle of a federal investigation.

12:47.894 --> 12:52.690
What, income tax? The fucking guy
just shot a police officer!

12:52.815 --> 12:56.152
It's very important
he not be apprehended at this time.

12:58.655 --> 13:02.200
We want to know where he's going
and who he's selling it to.

13:02.325 --> 13:07.413
- It's drugs?
- We're not DEA.

13:12.460 --> 13:15.630
We appreciate
your co-operation on this.

14:15.481 --> 14:18.318
I checked with Washington,
Fulbright's kosher.

14:18.443 --> 14:21.279
He's working
on something classified.

14:21.404 --> 14:25.241
If they want these guys loose
we should close the investigation.

14:25.366 --> 14:29.120
Fuck them. I want the man
that killed Todd. What you got?

14:29.245 --> 14:33.666
Not a hell of a lot.
The dead mechanics were executed.

14:33.791 --> 14:36.169
Only one was strapped,
he was still holstered.

14:36.294 --> 14:39.088
The bodies of the shooters
had 30,000 cash.

14:39.214 --> 14:42.634
- High-price heat.
- San Diego drivers' licenses.

14:42.759 --> 14:47.680
San Diego PD's sheet says enforcers
for hire for Tijuana drug dealers.

14:47.805 --> 14:49.349
It's about drugs?

14:49.474 --> 14:54.687
An attaché case had a towel from
the Wonder World Hotel, California.

14:54.812 --> 14:59.359
Wonder World? Did you check out
that car they shot Todd from?

14:59.484 --> 15:03.196
Rental from the airport.
The renter's a Dr Oliver Hirsch.

15:03.321 --> 15:04.906
- A stolen ID?
- Yeah.

15:05.031 --> 15:08.576
Doctor said it was lifted
while in an amusement park.

15:08.701 --> 15:12.205
- I hope the park was Wonder World.
- Yeah.

15:13.873 --> 15:18.127
- Excuse me.
- Wonder World.

15:21.673 --> 15:25.260
I understand
that you were with him at the end.

15:26.344 --> 15:29.430
Yeah. His last words were about you.

15:30.932 --> 15:35.645
That does not sound
like my Douglas, Axel. Try again.

15:37.772 --> 15:40.149
Actually, his last words were,

15:40.275 --> 15:44.529
"Axel, are you on a coffee break?
Go and get that son of a bitch."

15:44.654 --> 15:46.656
Those were his last words.

15:49.826 --> 15:55.248
- That sounds like my Douglas.
- It sounds like a good idea, too.

16:11.598 --> 16:14.392
Hello, I'm looking
for Billy Rosewood.

16:14.517 --> 16:17.061
Welcome to Beverly Hills Police.

16:44.422 --> 16:47.675
Monsieur Rosewood? In the house?

16:49.594 --> 16:51.930
Le Rosewood. Moi le Rosewood.

16:53.389 --> 16:58.645
"Monsieur était beau.
Le crayon. La table."

17:07.612 --> 17:09.405
Come in.

17:10.740 --> 17:12.742
It's open.

17:28.340 --> 17:31.052
- Axel Foley!
- Billy, how you doing?

17:31.177 --> 17:34.931
- I don't believe it.
- Look at your office! Look at this!

17:35.056 --> 17:38.643
You got three windows,
venetian blinds, and a ficus.

17:38.768 --> 17:42.063
One of them big, healthy
ficus in your office.

17:42.188 --> 17:46.359
Not just the ficus. Look.

17:46.484 --> 17:48.903
You got a refrigerator
in your office?

17:49.028 --> 17:51.906
J Edgar Hoover
didn't have a refrigerator.

17:52.031 --> 17:54.409
Just some hair curlers or something.

17:54.534 --> 17:58.872
- Did they promote you to captain?
- I'm DDO-JSIOC.

17:58.997 --> 18:01.791
The JG-Joe-Joe-C? What is that?

18:01.916 --> 18:03.793
Deputy Director of Operations

18:03.918 --> 18:08.214
for Joint Systems Interdepartmental
Operational Command.

18:11.509 --> 18:16.264
Here we are. Los Angeles. one of the
greatest cities in the world, Axel,

18:16.389 --> 18:19.100
divided by its unique geography.

18:19.225 --> 18:22.604
- Geography?
- LA is a vast metropolis

18:22.729 --> 18:26.524
with social and economic imbalances
spread over an enormous distance.

18:26.649 --> 18:30.945
A criminal hits Beverly Hills,
then West Hollywood, then downtown.

18:31.070 --> 18:34.741
Whose responsibility is it?
Everybody's?

18:34.866 --> 18:39.329
Impossible. So it comes here. Every
crime that crosses the green line.

18:39.454 --> 18:42.540
- The green line?
- Green lines of jurisdiction.

18:42.665 --> 18:45.585
Beverly Hills,
West Hollywood, Santa Monica.

18:45.710 --> 18:50.048
Officers respect these green lines,
but the criminal doesn't.

18:50.131 --> 18:55.053
Whenever a criminal crosses green
lines, the DDO-JSIOC goes to work.

18:55.178 --> 18:56.971
Very impressive, Billy.

18:57.096 --> 19:00.141
I control the green lines,
and Axel...

19:00.266 --> 19:04.729
whoever controls the green lines
controls Southern California.

19:07.357 --> 19:09.692
You wanted to see me, Billy?

19:09.817 --> 19:14.739
The sheriff's department nabbed
two guys pulling a stall-and-hook.

19:14.864 --> 19:17.825
It's the same MO
as those jobs on Melrose.

19:17.951 --> 19:20.161
I'll run out there and talk to them.

19:20.286 --> 19:23.706
They're in Van Nuys.
I'll tell them you're coming.

19:23.790 --> 19:26.376
Jon, I want you
to meet a friend of mine.

19:26.501 --> 19:29.045
Axel Foley. Axel, Jon Flint.

19:29.170 --> 19:33.424
How are you? I've heard about you.
You're from Detroit, right?

19:33.550 --> 19:37.887
- Taggart talked about you.
- Taggart! Where is he?

19:38.012 --> 19:40.181
Taggart's retired to Phoenix.

19:40.306 --> 19:44.394
Spends his days lost in the woods
looking for his golf balls.

19:45.520 --> 19:48.064
That's a dream
I'm not too far from myself.

19:48.189 --> 19:51.526
What brings you to California?
Vacation?

19:51.651 --> 19:55.363
- I'm looking for a killer.
- In Beverly Hills?

19:55.488 --> 19:58.908
- No. Wonder World.
- Wonder World?

19:59.033 --> 20:01.995
You mean Rufus Rabbit
has gone berserko?

20:02.078 --> 20:04.330
No. My boss got gunned down.

20:04.455 --> 20:07.917
The killer escaped
in a cream-coloured Ford truck.

20:08.042 --> 20:10.086
- I think it's here.
- Plates?

20:10.170 --> 20:14.215
Plates were phoney. Some evidence
points to Wonder World.

20:14.340 --> 20:17.719
I want to go to Wonder World
and ask some questions.

20:17.844 --> 20:22.182
- Would y'all know somebody there?
- Ellis DeWald, head of security.

20:22.307 --> 20:25.560
Biggest private
security force in America.

20:25.685 --> 20:30.565
- Can you introduce me to him?
- Soon as I get back from Van Nuys.

20:30.690 --> 20:34.402
You go on out. I'll call DeWald,
tell him you're coming.

20:34.527 --> 20:38.364
- He's a pal of mine. I'll meet you.
- Great. Thanks.

20:38.489 --> 20:41.534
You'll love Wonder World,
it's a great place.

20:41.659 --> 20:45.371
Axel, don't forget,
we play by the rules around here.

20:45.496 --> 20:48.208
I've heard Taggart's stories.

20:53.129 --> 20:54.881
Which one of those green lines
is Wonder World behind?

21:21.783 --> 21:24.160
Welcome to Wonder World. Can I help?

21:24.285 --> 21:28.289
Yes, I'd like to talk to a park
executive, a Mr. Ellis DeWald.

21:28.373 --> 21:32.001
- Do you have an appointment?
- I'm supposed to. Axel Foley.

21:32.126 --> 21:35.213
I'm sorry, sir.
I don't have you on the list.

21:35.338 --> 21:37.423
Maybe they haven't called yet.

21:37.507 --> 21:41.803
A Detective Flint was supposed
to call and get me squared away.

21:41.928 --> 21:45.765
If you don't have an appointment
you'll need a ticket.

21:46.891 --> 21:51.604
- How much is a ticket?
- $35.

21:51.729 --> 21:55.191
That allows you access
to all rides and attractions.

21:55.316 --> 21:59.195
Wait a minute.
I don't want to go on any rides.

21:59.320 --> 22:02.907
All I wanna do
is talk to the director of security.

22:03.032 --> 22:05.869
Excuse me, sir,
would you step out of line?

22:06.661 --> 22:09.831
- What line?
- Just step over here, please, sir.

22:09.956 --> 22:12.000
Thank you.

22:14.002 --> 22:18.506
- Is there a problem, sir?
- $35, that's the problem.

22:18.631 --> 22:21.885
If the admission seems high,
try Fantasy Park.

22:22.010 --> 22:25.388
You might find
their ticket price to your liking.

22:25.471 --> 22:28.725
I'm here to see Ellis DeWald.
Is he your boss?

22:28.850 --> 22:31.686
Yes. Mr. DeWald
is head of guest relations.

22:31.811 --> 22:36.065
- Do you have an appointment?
- I'm supposed to.

22:36.149 --> 22:39.402
Supposed to is not having,
is it, sir?

22:43.448 --> 22:45.283
Excuse me.

22:52.165 --> 22:55.335
- One, please.
- There you go. Thank you.

22:55.460 --> 22:56.878
Thank you.

22:59.214 --> 23:02.383
You should have your tailor
cut the jacket a little wider.

23:02.509 --> 23:05.678
That way your gun
won't bulge in the back.

23:11.267 --> 23:13.061
Thank you.

23:24.489 --> 23:26.491
Uncle Dave.

23:40.880 --> 23:42.632
What's going on?

24:39.022 --> 24:41.524
"Alien Attack"?

24:58.875 --> 25:00.668
Can I help you?

25:00.793 --> 25:03.296
I was just curious
what Alien Attack is.

25:05.131 --> 25:06.716
Watch.

25:09.469 --> 25:14.182
Attention! This is a red alert.
Aliens are invading the city.

25:14.307 --> 25:17.894
Board the subway trains
for immediate evacuation.

25:57.642 --> 25:59.435
This is wild.

25:59.561 --> 26:03.481
Yes. It's one of
our more popular attractions.

26:03.606 --> 26:06.901
Excuse me,
but what are you doing in here?

26:07.026 --> 26:12.448
You're right. I gotta go. I have
a meeting, but thanks for the show.

26:18.663 --> 26:21.332
Tunnel nine. Take a look.

26:24.919 --> 26:28.631
- What should we do?
- I'll send Cooper. Get him.

27:16.846 --> 27:18.848
Excuse me.

27:19.724 --> 27:24.354
- That's not fair.
- Maintenance. Gotta grease a chain.

27:24.479 --> 27:27.148
- Hear how dry it sounds?
- Sorry.

27:29.025 --> 27:31.027
Come on. Let's go.

27:43.998 --> 27:45.875
- Hi, Mom!
- Up here!

27:46.000 --> 27:50.171
- Hi, Mommy! Up here!
- We're here!

27:54.843 --> 27:57.887
- Bring that man down.
- I can't until it goes all...

27:58.012 --> 28:00.306
- Bring it down, damn it.
- Don't...

28:02.642 --> 28:04.769
Don't. Don't! Jesus!

28:12.443 --> 28:15.697
- What the hell?
- Oh, my God!

28:42.015 --> 28:43.558
Code red on The Spider.

28:50.690 --> 28:52.859
Wonder World? Axel!

29:08.041 --> 29:10.335
Help!

29:13.421 --> 29:15.340
Help! Please!

29:15.465 --> 29:17.091
Shit!

29:25.975 --> 29:27.769
My God. Look!

29:52.335 --> 29:55.630
- Are you all right?
- I'm OK, just don't let go.

30:15.316 --> 30:18.027
All units near Wonder World,

30:18.152 --> 30:21.030
proceed to assist
in emergency rescue.

31:30.975 --> 31:34.938
You see this rope? We're gonna
slide down it to the ground.

31:35.063 --> 31:39.234
- We are?
- We're gonna try.

31:43.238 --> 31:45.240
Come up and hold on to my neck.

31:47.534 --> 31:49.827
Come on. It's OK.

31:52.163 --> 31:57.961
You gonna grab onto my neck really
tight. Come on. Hold on really tight.

31:58.086 --> 32:00.338
Not too tight!

32:08.721 --> 32:10.932
Give me your hand.

32:11.057 --> 32:15.854
Come on. None of that.
Give me your hand. Come on. It's OK.

32:19.107 --> 32:20.692
Come on.

32:25.613 --> 32:27.866
Hang on tight!

32:33.371 --> 32:35.790
Come on. Come on up.

33:15.205 --> 33:20.126
Our head of security confirmed your
identity with the Detroit police.

33:22.128 --> 33:24.797
But neither they nor l...

33:27.175 --> 33:30.220
..understand what
you're doing at Wonder World.

33:30.345 --> 33:32.680
I'm investigating a crime.

33:32.805 --> 33:35.225
I've been here 10 minutes
and I've already been shot at.

33:35.350 --> 33:38.686
Yes. Some of our
guest relations people, you said.

33:40.563 --> 33:42.607
Miss Perkins is here
with the surveillance tapes.

33:42.732 --> 33:45.151
Send her right in.

33:53.868 --> 33:57.205
This starts in The Spider
maintenance tunnel.

34:01.501 --> 34:04.337
There I am,
coming down the tunnel.

34:07.841 --> 34:11.844
- What is that?
- Tracking. The monitors are looped.

34:14.889 --> 34:19.393
- I don't see any gunmen, Mr. Foley.
- So who was I shooting at?

34:19.518 --> 34:23.648
You better think about a lawyer.
The tapes don't show your gunman.

34:23.773 --> 34:25.942
They don't show something else,

34:26.067 --> 34:31.447
Mr. Foley's courage when the ride
malfunctioned. He risked his life.

34:31.572 --> 34:33.074
They don't show that.

34:33.199 --> 34:38.830
That would be very impressive,
if you didn't cause the malfunction.

34:40.164 --> 34:42.958
- Mr. DeWald.
- Send him in.

34:43.960 --> 34:46.295
Mr. Foley, Mr. DeWald.

34:46.963 --> 34:50.132
You fuck! Motherfucker...
That's him!

34:51.217 --> 34:53.887
That's the fucking guy
I'm looking for!

34:53.969 --> 34:55.972
What's going on here?

34:56.097 --> 34:58.683
He shot a Detroit police officer
last weekend!

34:58.808 --> 35:03.688
Last weekend? I was at my
beach house in Laguna last weekend.

35:03.813 --> 35:05.857
Your beach home in Laguna?

35:07.025 --> 35:09.402
Wait. I think I got the wrong guy.

35:09.527 --> 35:12.447
I'm sorry.
This is a big misunderstanding.

35:12.572 --> 35:14.574
You were at your beach...

35:14.699 --> 35:17.702
Fuck! Beach house in Laguna!
You motherfucker!

35:17.827 --> 35:21.873
- Miss Bruce, call the police.
- They just walked in.

35:25.418 --> 35:29.589
- That guy! That's the killer!
- Ellis DeWald?

35:36.763 --> 35:39.224
We really appreciate this, Ellis.

35:39.307 --> 35:42.810
Your friend is lucky Mr. Sanderson
doesn't want any publicity.

35:42.936 --> 35:48.274
You just keep him and his delusions
out of my face and out of my park.

35:48.399 --> 35:53.404
No problem. You got it. By the way,
are we still on for Sunday?

35:54.614 --> 35:56.491
Bring your money, sucker.

35:56.574 --> 35:59.911
All right. When you have
some time, I'd like to...

36:00.036 --> 36:02.247
Not right now. Later, perhaps.

36:02.372 --> 36:04.374
Thanks.

36:11.422 --> 36:13.508
Here we go.

36:14.551 --> 36:16.344
Thank you.

36:17.762 --> 36:20.181
And the usual for you, Billy.

36:24.018 --> 36:27.689
- Thanks a lot.
- Isn't it possible you're mistaken?

36:28.898 --> 36:32.235
That Ellis DeWald
just resembles Todd's killer?

36:32.360 --> 36:35.154
I made the guy in Detroit.
It was DeWald.

36:35.280 --> 36:41.035
He's the head of the largest private
police department in California.

36:41.160 --> 36:46.791
He works with us, with the governor's
office. Everybody loves him.

36:46.916 --> 36:51.671
He's getting an award from the
Association of Security Agencies.

36:53.214 --> 36:56.342
It's understandable
that you're distraught

36:56.467 --> 36:59.762
and looking for justice,
not to mention revenge.

36:59.888 --> 37:03.975
But isn't it just possible
that you want it so much

37:04.100 --> 37:07.687
that you saw your killer in a man
who bore a slight resemblance?

37:07.812 --> 37:11.316
We run into this
all the time in police work.

37:11.441 --> 37:14.360
- Where's he getting that award?
- Don't!

37:14.485 --> 37:18.239
Flint, your friend DeWald is foul.
I know he's foul,

37:18.364 --> 37:22.410
and I'm going to this awards show
to put some pressure on him.

37:22.535 --> 37:25.580
Maybe panic him
into doing something stupid.

37:25.663 --> 37:28.958
Axel, if you go
to that dinner tonight...

37:29.083 --> 37:34.047
- I'm going with you.
- Pick me up at the Sunset Motel.

38:08.831 --> 38:10.834
Freeze, motherfucker!

38:13.461 --> 38:17.215
- Detective Foley?
- You're Uncle Dave!

38:18.341 --> 38:21.344
Oh, my God. I almost shot Uncle Dave!

38:21.469 --> 38:26.057
I'm so embarrassed. I'm sorry.
Nice to meet you! Uncle Dave!

38:26.140 --> 38:29.143
The front desk let us in.
I hope that's OK.

38:29.269 --> 38:32.438
No, it's fine. It's Uncle Dave!

38:32.564 --> 38:35.859
Uncle Dave! Have a seat.

38:35.984 --> 38:38.486
- Thank you.
- I was such a fan of yours.

38:38.611 --> 38:41.030
- Thank you, son.
- Uncle Dave...

38:41.155 --> 38:47.912
You're very kind. Detective Foley,
what's going on at my park?

38:48.037 --> 38:51.249
- There's something going on?
- I have no doubts.

38:51.374 --> 38:54.586
- What?
- I have no doubts,

38:54.711 --> 38:56.963
nor do I have any ideas.

38:57.088 --> 39:00.884
Exactly two weeks ago,
Detective Foley,

39:01.009 --> 39:05.638
Roger Fry, the park's
chief operating officer...

39:05.763 --> 39:08.600
and my friend, disappeared.

39:08.725 --> 39:14.147
Roger Fry designed the park, from the
landscaping to the concession stands.

39:14.272 --> 39:17.442
- What do you mean, disappeared?
- Show him the note.

39:18.651 --> 39:23.156
I received this interoffice
the day Roger disappeared.

39:23.281 --> 39:26.242
"This is important,
life and death. Roger"

39:27.368 --> 39:29.787
- What was so important?
- I don't know.

39:29.913 --> 39:32.582
What was he doing
the day he disappeared?

39:32.665 --> 39:37.003
He was probably doing
one of his usual inspections.

39:38.588 --> 39:42.425
- This guy designed the whole park?
- Yes.

39:44.802 --> 39:48.765
- And he knew the place cold?
- Of course.

39:48.890 --> 39:50.892
So what are you thinking?

39:51.017 --> 39:54.729
He must've found something
someone didn't want him to find.

39:54.812 --> 39:58.733
At Wonder World?
What on earth could that be?

39:58.858 --> 40:01.861
It's a place
of childhood innocence and fun.

40:01.986 --> 40:03.071
And life and death.

40:08.117 --> 40:12.205
You met Uncle Dave? Uncle Dave.

40:14.582 --> 40:18.628
I don't believe it. I'd give
anything to have been with you.

40:18.753 --> 40:21.464
- Did he do the Oki-Doki Shuffle?
- No.

40:31.933 --> 40:33.935
Outstanding.

40:35.979 --> 40:40.108
- William Rosewood, DDO-JSIOC.
- I beg your pardon?

40:42.443 --> 40:44.821
This is me. Thank you.

40:48.950 --> 40:51.619
What you gonna do with this shit?

40:53.621 --> 40:57.542
No way.
I don't believe this! Ackwell!

40:59.169 --> 41:04.674
Ackwell Folee! Ackwell Folee, you
crazy thing. What you doing here?

41:07.385 --> 41:09.220
- "Surge."
- Serge.

41:11.472 --> 41:13.975
Look at your head!
I love it short!

41:14.058 --> 41:17.979
- Yeah, Serge.
- Turn around. Turn around.

41:18.104 --> 41:22.317
You look perfect! And finally
you have black "Hush Poopies",

41:22.400 --> 41:26.154
which are totally retro.
You put a good package together.

41:27.405 --> 41:31.659
- You remember Billy Rosewood.
- Billy, I remember you.

41:31.743 --> 41:33.745
- Do you remember?
- Of course.

41:33.828 --> 41:37.624
I made you an espresso at
the art gallery with a lemon twist?

41:39.167 --> 41:41.503
It was the last one I ever made.

41:41.628 --> 41:44.380
It's terrible, espresso.
You know why?

41:44.506 --> 41:48.134
It stain your teeth. I won't
show you mine. Show me your teeth.

41:49.928 --> 41:52.263
They're so pretty.
Can I see your teeth?

41:53.598 --> 41:55.558
And you got healthy gums.

41:55.683 --> 41:57.810
- Do you do colonics?
- Excuse me?

41:57.936 --> 42:00.271
- Do you do colonics?
- No. Never...

42:00.396 --> 42:03.149
- It's my new favourite!
- You dig colonics?

42:03.274 --> 42:06.444
- They stick a hose up inside you...
- I know...

42:06.569 --> 42:08.571
No, you've got to understand.

42:08.696 --> 42:12.408
Out comes a candy bar
from when you were five!

42:14.160 --> 42:18.289
- What happened to your art gallery?
- It is completely bankrupt,

42:18.414 --> 42:20.750
in the toilet. Why?

42:20.875 --> 42:24.921
Because we had an owner who was
obstinate and stupid and ignorant.

42:25.046 --> 42:27.882
- You shot him, remember?
- Yes. I shot him.

42:28.007 --> 42:31.094
- What are you doing now?
- I'm doing guns. Come!

42:35.098 --> 42:37.851
This is my booth.
The Survival Boutique.

42:37.976 --> 42:43.356
We are doing weapons and protective
devices and products for survival

42:43.481 --> 42:46.192
in the helter-skelter world of today.

42:47.277 --> 42:50.780
One thing's very important.
At the Survival Boutique,

42:50.905 --> 42:56.286
it's my philosophy that everything
must conform to the three P's.

42:56.411 --> 42:59.831
Which is protection,
prestige and pretty.

43:01.791 --> 43:05.712
Why should you look ugly
if you're just trying to survive?

43:05.837 --> 43:10.675
You should maintain your style
and be safe. Guess what this is.

43:11.885 --> 43:15.013
Is look like a key chain,
but it's so much more.

43:15.138 --> 43:18.975
It's called a stunner.
It is designed by an ex-Navy SEAL.

43:19.100 --> 43:21.978
Very serious individual,
I never see him smile.

43:22.103 --> 43:24.772
Also I never see him
in pants that fit.

43:27.775 --> 43:30.778
Someone comes up to you
who is a carjacker.

43:30.904 --> 43:34.282
Do you want to die for your Camry?
I don't think so.

43:34.407 --> 43:37.327
So you say -
a little bit of deception -

43:37.410 --> 43:40.205
"l want to separate
my house and car keys.

43:40.330 --> 43:43.833
"I'll just push this button, OK?"
And he says, "OK."

43:43.958 --> 43:48.379
And then you push this button,
and out it comes from the mechanism,

43:48.505 --> 43:52.091
the brightest, blinding light
ever that you seeing.

43:52.217 --> 43:54.344
He cannot see. He's like this.

43:54.469 --> 43:56.971
Everyone is come running
to help you.

43:57.096 --> 44:00.099
And once again,
you have survived with style.

44:00.225 --> 44:02.352
That's cool.

44:02.435 --> 44:06.564
Billy, I want to give you one
for a present.

44:06.648 --> 44:08.483
Thank you.

44:08.608 --> 44:12.153
And, Ackwell, I want to give you one
because I worry about you.

44:12.278 --> 44:16.199
- I want you to be safe.
- Thanks.

44:16.324 --> 44:20.870
Now I'll show you something that
is going to blow your rocks off.

44:20.995 --> 44:25.625
It's absolutely orgasmic
and my most thing that I'm proud of.

44:25.750 --> 44:30.547
It's the most up-to-date, the
ultimate survival tool for today.

44:31.631 --> 44:37.011
A new generation of luxury personal
weaponry, the Annihilator 2000

44:37.136 --> 44:41.766
is America's premier survival,
home and travel security unit.

44:41.891 --> 44:45.895
The Annihilator 2000
is a high-performance weapon

44:46.020 --> 44:50.483
that meets the demands
of upper income urban survivalists.

44:50.608 --> 44:53.444
The Annihilator 2000
has the conveniences

44:53.528 --> 44:56.614
of a cellphone,
fax and microwave oven.

44:58.241 --> 45:01.327
Night-vision goggles,
microprocessor,

45:01.452 --> 45:05.582
verbal alarm systems,
compact disc player, digital radio,

45:05.707 --> 45:09.878
video camera and playback functions
are just a few features

45:10.003 --> 45:12.422
of the extraordinary
Annihilator 2000.

45:12.547 --> 45:14.716
You think those are real?

45:14.841 --> 45:18.219
Stopping power
is a matter of convenience.

45:20.263 --> 45:26.060
That's Dodi, my personal trainer.
She can bench-press 200lbs.

45:27.145 --> 45:30.773
She's working on reducing
my body fat, but it's difficult

45:30.899 --> 45:35.612
because I keep sneaking goat cheese.
I don't care. I wear suits.

45:35.737 --> 45:39.407
The Annihilator 2000
is constructed of aluminium alloy

45:39.532 --> 45:44.037
combined with polymer technology,
totally resistant to corrosion.

45:46.539 --> 45:51.336
A new generation in luxury personal
weaponry, the Annihilator 2000

45:51.461 --> 45:56.382
is America's premier survival,
home and travel security unit.

45:56.508 --> 45:58.259
Who's gonna buy that shit?

45:58.384 --> 46:03.014
Are you joking? This is LA.
I'm selling hundreds of these.

46:03.139 --> 46:06.893
- Get the fuck outta here!
- No, because I am telling you,

46:07.018 --> 46:10.021
I sell 10 of these
to Jackie Stallone.

46:10.146 --> 46:13.358
- Get the fuck outta here.
- Sly bought 14.

46:13.483 --> 46:16.069
Zsa Zsa Gabor has one...

46:16.194 --> 46:18.488
- We gotta go, Surge.
- Thanks.

46:18.613 --> 46:21.950
Ackwell, try to say Serge.
It's not so difficult.

46:22.075 --> 46:23.660
"Surge" sounds like a detergent.

46:35.880 --> 46:37.799
What are you gonna do?

46:37.924 --> 46:41.302
Nothing.
I just wanna hear the man speak.

46:42.178 --> 46:49.102
To keep a park like Wonder World
a safe, wholesome, family environment

46:49.227 --> 46:54.357
in difficult times like these
is an enormous challenge.

46:56.568 --> 47:00.530
But my friend Ellis DeWald
has done just that.

47:04.993 --> 47:09.163
Couple that with Ellis' work
with underprivileged kids,

47:09.289 --> 47:13.626
some of whom are seated at the
head table right now with Ellis...

47:27.974 --> 47:31.269
..and you can understand
why he's our award winner.

47:31.394 --> 47:35.648
So let's bring him up here.
Head of security at Wonder World

47:35.773 --> 47:39.110
and private law enforcement's
Man of the Year award winner,

47:39.235 --> 47:41.446
my dear friend, Ellis DeWald.

47:55.168 --> 47:59.005
- Congratulations. You deserve it.
- Thank you, Orrin.

47:59.130 --> 48:01.549
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Mike.

48:17.398 --> 48:20.735
You're not gonna do nothing.
You never do nothing.

48:20.860 --> 48:24.948
Thank you very much.
You know, a lot of nice things happen

48:25.073 --> 48:28.493
when you work at a nice place
like Wonder World,

48:28.618 --> 48:32.914
especially when your bosses
are people like Orrin Sanderson

48:33.039 --> 48:38.294
and Uncle Dave Thornton. I don't
think that Uncle Dave would mind

48:38.419 --> 48:43.633
if I said that this is
the nicest thing yet.

48:43.758 --> 48:45.760
Thank you very much.

48:50.348 --> 48:54.018
Please don't do this, Axel.
Please don't do it. Don't do it.

48:54.143 --> 48:56.521
- Bravo! Bravo!
- Don't do it.

48:56.646 --> 48:59.816
Bravo, Ellis DeWald! Ellis DeWald!

49:06.197 --> 49:09.450
Ellis DeWald, ladies and gentlemen!

49:09.576 --> 49:11.870
Ellis DeWald! Y'all keep it going!

49:11.995 --> 49:15.582
Keep it going for Ellis DeWald!
Come on, it's Ellis!

49:17.458 --> 49:21.337
You're not clapping loud enough!
This is Ellis DeWald!

49:24.132 --> 49:27.468
Ladies and gentlemen,
I've travelled from Detroit

49:27.594 --> 49:31.264
to be with this man tonight,
to honour this man tonight.

49:31.389 --> 49:34.893
My name is Axel Foley.
I'm a Detroit police officer.

49:35.018 --> 49:39.272
It is a tremendous surprise
for Mr. DeWald to have me next to him.

49:39.397 --> 49:41.399
I can feel his body tingling!

49:41.524 --> 49:45.904
But, ladies and gentlemen,
there's not a night that goes by

49:46.029 --> 49:49.824
that I don't think about
what I owe Ellis DeWald.

49:49.949 --> 49:54.037
And there's not a night that passes
that I don't think about

49:54.162 --> 49:57.832
what the people of Detroit
owe Ellis DeWald.

49:57.957 --> 50:01.544
And I'd like to say,
when I see y'all give him this...

50:01.669 --> 50:04.339
What's this? That's beautiful...

50:04.464 --> 50:07.592
"With gratitude
for community service."

50:07.717 --> 50:10.553
And I'm going to do
the community a service

50:10.678 --> 50:13.806
because I'm going
to pay back Ellis DeWald

50:13.932 --> 50:16.768
everything we owe him with interest!

50:25.902 --> 50:29.864
Go on, smile.
Get them last few smiles in.

50:29.989 --> 50:34.118
What's the matter? You mad at me
for shooting your boyfriend?

50:45.338 --> 50:47.757
I got him! I got him! I got him!

50:52.637 --> 50:55.849
You and Billy
disturbing the peace? No!

50:56.850 --> 51:00.019
Just make your phone call
and get us out of here.

51:00.144 --> 51:04.190
Sure. Who do I know
down there? Let's see.

51:04.315 --> 51:06.317
Don't fuck with me right now.

51:06.442 --> 51:08.862
Keep your shirt on.
I'll get you out.

51:08.987 --> 51:12.198
Incidentally,
we found that truck you wanted.

51:13.366 --> 51:15.618
- Where?
- By the Santa Monica pier.

51:15.743 --> 51:18.997
I'm headed there now.
I'll pick you up on the way.

51:19.122 --> 51:22.375
In the meantime,
don't take any showers.

51:32.844 --> 51:35.763
I'm all washed-up. Dead in the water.

51:35.889 --> 51:39.225
Stop worrying.
Flint's going to get us out.

51:39.350 --> 51:42.020
I really liked that office.

51:42.103 --> 51:46.232
- Foley! You're out of here.
- That was quick.

51:48.026 --> 51:49.777
Not him, just you.

51:55.950 --> 51:57.994
Come in.

52:09.839 --> 52:12.217
Thank you, officer.

52:15.386 --> 52:17.597
I ran a check on you, Foley.

52:19.432 --> 52:23.269
You're a hell of a detective,
but something of a maverick.

52:26.898 --> 52:29.567
I know what you're doing.
I know the drill.

52:30.985 --> 52:35.615
You hassle DeWald, you get him
to panic, make a rash move...

52:36.783 --> 52:41.162
But God damn it, Foley,
we do not want to panic this man.

52:41.287 --> 52:47.752
We want him doing business as fucking
usual. Do you copy me, Foley?

52:54.092 --> 52:59.514
Ticket to Detroit, first class,
courtesy of the Federal Government.

52:59.639 --> 53:01.891
Also, my card.

53:02.016 --> 53:06.729
Should you have any more thoughts
about DeWald, let us handle it.

53:14.654 --> 53:17.073
I give you my word as a gentleman
I'll be on that plane.

53:26.624 --> 53:29.711
Truck was spotted
by an LAPD traffic officer.

53:29.836 --> 53:33.590
It's a different colour
but the same make and model.

53:33.715 --> 53:37.844
Read you. Out. Beach leader, over?

53:37.969 --> 53:40.388
Negatory, SWAT,
hold for our arrival.

53:40.513 --> 53:43.725
ETA...11 minutes. Out.

53:45.727 --> 53:47.729
Billy, who were you talking to?

53:47.854 --> 53:50.523
Truck was inside
the county green line,

53:50.648 --> 53:53.234
so I co-ordinated
with the SMPD, BHPD,

53:53.359 --> 53:58.031
LAPD, sheriff of Los Angeles County,
Parks and Recreation,

53:58.156 --> 54:03.369
Highway Patrol, district attorney's
office and US Naval Shore Patrol.

54:14.464 --> 54:16.925
Beach leader to team one. Proceed.

54:42.992 --> 54:44.994
All teams standing ready...

54:46.663 --> 54:48.248
Go! Go! Go!

54:57.507 --> 54:59.300
Area secured.

55:09.060 --> 55:12.605
Lab says these are the same
fibres as the truck upholstery.

55:12.730 --> 55:17.902
No help there. Some sand, probably
blew in after it was abandoned.

55:21.489 --> 55:24.951
I just had a very unpleasant
conversation with my superiors.

55:25.076 --> 55:27.912
- About being busted?
- No.

55:28.037 --> 55:32.333
There was some objection to my use
of manpower on Operation Truck Siege.

55:37.839 --> 55:40.175
- What is it?
- You got a $50 bill?

55:40.300 --> 55:43.428
I'm married with kids.
I haven't seen a 50 in 12 years.

55:43.553 --> 55:47.056
- You got a $50 bill?
- When do I get it back?

55:47.182 --> 55:49.851
Man, give me $50!

55:54.564 --> 55:56.566
It's all I got.

56:03.364 --> 56:07.619
This is part of a $50 bill like
Billy's with the hidden barcode.

56:07.744 --> 56:10.205
The corner tore.
Happens all the time.

56:10.330 --> 56:14.209
No, the barcode's going up,
so it comes off this corner.

56:14.334 --> 56:17.629
If it comes off this corner
it should have ink on it.

56:17.754 --> 56:19.088
It's too big to be blank.

56:48.618 --> 56:51.496
Look! It's Oki-Doki!

56:56.209 --> 57:00.380
Don't let your brother get away.
I got to load my camera.

57:00.505 --> 57:02.423
Oki-Doki!

57:02.549 --> 57:06.344
Nice little kid.
How you doing? Good to see you.

57:06.469 --> 57:12.433
- I love you, Oki-Doki!
- Oki, do the Oki Shuffle.

57:17.355 --> 57:19.774
That's not right! It's like this.

57:21.985 --> 57:25.572
Listen, I changed the steps.
You got a problem with that?

57:26.865 --> 57:29.868
You're supposed to be nice,
no matter what!

57:31.369 --> 57:33.371
You little motherfucker...

57:42.422 --> 57:45.758
Grandma! Grandma!
Oki-Doki pushed me!

57:52.515 --> 57:54.684
You take it already.

57:54.809 --> 57:57.562
Come on, Sheldon.
You playing or what?

57:57.687 --> 57:59.689
Who ate garlic?

57:59.814 --> 58:02.859
When's lunch?
I want a pastrami on rye.

58:02.984 --> 58:04.944
See that move, Rufus Rabbit?

58:07.822 --> 58:09.407
- Axel?
- What?

58:09.532 --> 58:13.244
Coffee. Would you like some coffee?

58:13.369 --> 58:15.538
Louis, how's it going?

58:15.663 --> 58:18.333
- Fine, fine.
- Say hi to Irene.

58:18.416 --> 58:20.793
- Will do.
- Louis?

58:22.837 --> 58:24.464
Follow me.

58:24.589 --> 58:28.551
I wouldn't mind giving her a massage.

58:28.676 --> 58:31.596
When DeWald took over
he stuck me down here

58:31.721 --> 58:34.140
on what he calls park safety watch.

58:34.265 --> 58:37.143
He thinks he took me
out of the loop,

58:37.268 --> 58:39.604
but as long as I have a computer

58:39.729 --> 58:43.566
I can still access
most of what's in the mainframe.

58:43.691 --> 58:46.653
- Is this the tunnel system?
- Yes.

58:46.778 --> 58:52.492
Do any of these tunnels lead to
somewhere only DeWald's boys can go?

58:52.617 --> 58:56.788
No. All park accesses are
unrestricted to park personnel.

58:56.913 --> 59:00.208
Except for the Happy Forest.
That's being redone.

59:00.333 --> 59:02.335
Show me the Happy Forest.

59:02.460 --> 59:06.965
That would be right here
at the end of corridor B.

59:07.090 --> 59:09.092
It's right after...

59:11.177 --> 59:13.346
It's right after...

59:14.264 --> 59:17.559
- How long's it been closed?
- Too long.

59:20.812 --> 59:23.815
I'm talking about
the Happy Forest ride?

59:26.526 --> 59:30.613
The Forest.
Yes, about a couple of weeks.

59:30.738 --> 59:34.576
It wasn't very popular
so they're trying some new ideas.

59:34.701 --> 59:37.871
I think they found one.
Can I have this?

59:37.996 --> 59:40.456
- Sure.
- Thanks.

59:45.336 --> 59:47.255
There you go.

59:47.380 --> 59:51.176
You know...
when this thing is over...

59:56.681 --> 01:00:01.102
Would you like to get together
and have some dinner or something?

01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:05.231
- That would be nice.
- Can you put that in here?

01:00:05.356 --> 01:00:07.650
Sure. There you go.

01:00:07.775 --> 01:00:09.485
- We have a date.
- A date.

01:00:09.611 --> 01:00:11.988
All right.
Can you help me with this?

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:16.242
There you go.

01:00:17.410 --> 01:00:19.412
Remember, an elephant never forgets.

01:00:19.537 --> 01:00:21.497
All right.

01:00:30.632 --> 01:00:33.051
- Louis, how goes it?
- Fine. Nice to see you.

01:00:33.176 --> 01:00:36.387
- Say hello to Irene.
- You bet. See you.

01:02:17.322 --> 01:02:19.282
Everything on schedule?

01:02:19.407 --> 01:02:23.661
I had to tweak the image a little
bit, but it's under control now.

01:02:33.379 --> 01:02:35.632
Foley's up there.

01:03:11.543 --> 01:03:13.628
Get him!

01:04:06.556 --> 01:04:09.392
Will the DeWald family
please come to Tiny Town?

01:04:09.517 --> 01:04:11.895
The DeWald family to Tiny Town.

01:04:21.362 --> 01:04:25.074
But, honey,
the Happy Forest is closed.

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:29.245
OK, I'll meet you
at the main gate at 5:00.

01:04:30.371 --> 01:04:33.082
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

01:04:47.096 --> 01:04:51.392
This is Detective Axel Foley. I'd
like to speak with Agent Fulbright.

01:04:51.518 --> 01:04:55.230
Could you patch me into his radio?
It's an emergency.

01:04:57.148 --> 01:04:58.942
Fulbright, Foley.

01:05:02.737 --> 01:05:06.157
I found what you're looking for.
I'm at Wonder World.

01:05:07.659 --> 01:05:09.661
Fuck! Get out here now!

01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:12.455
Get me 911.

01:05:35.728 --> 01:05:38.773
All cars in the vicinity
of Wonder World.

01:05:38.898 --> 01:05:43.528
Proceed there immediately.
10-19, 10-45, and 12-22 in progress.

01:05:43.653 --> 01:05:46.114
Why am I not surprised?

01:06:31.659 --> 01:06:34.996
All right, don't shoot!
I'll put my gun down.

01:06:35.997 --> 01:06:40.960
I put my gun on the ground,
and I'm unarmed. Don't shoot.

01:06:43.379 --> 01:06:45.006
This is great.

01:06:46.758 --> 01:06:50.803
You caught him. Good.
He broke into a security area.

01:06:52.305 --> 01:06:55.558
Relax. Save that shit
for new talent night at San Quentin.

01:06:55.683 --> 01:06:59.562
- I'm on to your operation.
- My operation?

01:07:00.730 --> 01:07:03.399
God damn it, Axel,
what have you done now?

01:07:03.483 --> 01:07:06.861
He went berserk.
He was firing a weapon in the park.

01:07:06.986 --> 01:07:09.656
There are hundreds
of children around.

01:07:09.781 --> 01:07:13.952
- They don't give Oscars in prison.
- Fuck you!

01:07:16.996 --> 01:07:18.998
There's someone here from...

01:07:20.166 --> 01:07:22.377
Fulbright, Secret Service.

01:07:30.635 --> 01:07:34.597
- I put you on a plane to Detroit.
- You're gonna be glad I stayed.

01:07:34.722 --> 01:07:38.309
I know what you're investigating.
It's right here.

01:07:38.434 --> 01:07:41.104
Yeah? And what am I investigating?

01:07:41.187 --> 01:07:44.858
Paper, US Mint quality.
That's what was in that truck.

01:07:44.983 --> 01:07:49.863
You wanted to follow the truck
back to LA to find his print shop.

01:07:49.988 --> 01:07:53.616
- It's right here in Wonder World.
- What is he raving on about?

01:07:53.741 --> 01:07:56.870
- He's insane! He's proved that.
- In Wonder World?

01:07:56.995 --> 01:08:00.874
This place is as high-tech
as NASA and Nintendo combined.

01:08:00.999 --> 01:08:05.336
They got a hidden room under
this closed ride. I was in there.

01:08:05.461 --> 01:08:07.505
That's why they were chasing me.

01:08:07.630 --> 01:08:09.632
My men were pursuing Mr. Foley

01:08:09.757 --> 01:08:12.802
because he's delusionary
and potentially dangerous.

01:08:12.927 --> 01:08:15.430
This room, delusionary also?

01:08:16.598 --> 01:08:19.475
No. There is a closed ride,
which we use to...

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:24.272
- I'd better take a look at it.
- Maybe we'd better look at it.

01:08:31.863 --> 01:08:35.617
Right here. Counterfeit bills,
out of this machine.

01:08:35.742 --> 01:08:38.786
- Is this true?
- 'Fraid so, officer.

01:08:38.912 --> 01:08:42.415
'Fraid we've been
caught red-handed, right, Ellis?

01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:44.876
'Fraid so.

01:08:46.377 --> 01:08:50.506
Would you like to see them?
First quality. Make a run, Donald.

01:09:06.523 --> 01:09:09.108
We call them Wonder World dollars.

01:09:09.234 --> 01:09:12.403
Redeemable for admission,
rides, souvenirs.

01:09:12.529 --> 01:09:14.781
It's our big Christmas promotion.

01:09:14.906 --> 01:09:19.035
We're giving it away to elementary
schools across the country.

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:21.246
You must be in on this.

01:09:21.371 --> 01:09:24.707
You supply equipment,
he supplies paper, right?

01:09:24.832 --> 01:09:27.585
They changed it
to this shit after I left.

01:09:27.710 --> 01:09:32.340
- After we leave they'll put it back.
- What's this paper?

01:09:34.634 --> 01:09:37.095
- Ordinary rag.
- They switched it.

01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:40.139
I am tired
of these accusations, officers.

01:09:40.265 --> 01:09:43.685
I want this man
arrested for public endangerment.

01:09:45.812 --> 01:09:47.814
Could I speak with you a moment?

01:09:49.274 --> 01:09:53.944
God damn it, we spent a fucking year
with our noses up DeWald's ass!

01:09:54.069 --> 01:09:59.576
We're this close to locking this up,
and you piss all over us!

01:09:59.701 --> 01:10:01.870
Our case is blown.

01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:06.374
You're going back to Detroit,
and if you weren't a cop,

01:10:06.499 --> 01:10:10.378
I'd have you doing dead time
in Leavenworth for life.

01:10:11.421 --> 01:10:13.631
Detective Flint, he's yours.

01:10:17.135 --> 01:10:19.137
Let's go, Axel.

01:10:25.018 --> 01:10:26.811
Make sure he doesn't
get on the plane.

01:10:28.563 --> 01:10:32.650
I got a wife, three kids, a mortgage
and a pension that won't cut it.

01:10:32.775 --> 01:10:35.904
That job at Wonder World
is my retirement plan.

01:10:39.073 --> 01:10:41.075
We're being followed.

01:10:42.452 --> 01:10:45.121
It's the security guards
at Wonder World.

01:10:45.246 --> 01:10:48.082
They probably want to make sure
you get on that plane.

01:10:50.126 --> 01:10:53.546
Because of you, my future
is in real fucking jeopardy.

01:10:53.671 --> 01:10:57.717
DeWald is pissed. Sanderson
won't think too highly of me.

01:10:57.842 --> 01:10:59.761
Hold up! Stop the car!

01:11:00.803 --> 01:11:04.057
- That liquor store. Stop!
- What?

01:11:04.182 --> 01:11:06.601
- Oh, shit!
- Wait!

01:11:13.483 --> 01:11:19.155
It's all right. Don't worry. I'll
get him. When I do, I'll kill him!

01:11:28.248 --> 01:11:31.543
Axel, I left as soon
as I got your call. Are you OK?

01:11:31.668 --> 01:11:36.756
I'm fine, but I want you to think
back to the night Fry disappeared.

01:11:36.881 --> 01:11:41.636
- Maybe you forgot something.
- No. Why would you think that?

01:11:41.761 --> 01:11:46.224
Because this note by itself...
it just don't make no sense.

01:11:46.349 --> 01:11:50.979
"This is important. Life and death."
Why would he even send that?

01:11:52.647 --> 01:11:57.318
Not "help, I need to talk to you,"
nothing. Just this.

01:12:14.669 --> 01:12:19.716
Oh, shit. Fry must have found
some sample paper.

01:12:19.841 --> 01:12:21.885
He knew they'd kill him
so he sent it to you.

01:12:22.010 --> 01:12:24.679
- There's a barcode.
- What does that mean?

01:12:24.804 --> 01:12:26.806
It used to belong to Uncle Sam.

01:12:26.931 --> 01:12:31.227
Now we got evidence. We can put
Sanderson and DeWald's ass in jail.

01:12:31.352 --> 01:12:34.147
I don't think so.

01:12:34.272 --> 01:12:38.401
I figured you'd call Uncle Dave
here, so we followed him.

01:12:40.778 --> 01:12:45.825
I actually was a real cop once
so I know how you assholes think,

01:12:45.950 --> 01:12:48.328
which is to say, slowly.

01:12:49.454 --> 01:12:51.497
Very slowly.

01:12:54.626 --> 01:12:58.963
So you were carrying the evidence
the whole time, Sherlock?

01:13:00.715 --> 01:13:05.803
Here's the real ending of the story.
Let's see if you like it.

01:13:05.929 --> 01:13:09.599
We heard you were loose.
You had a grudge against the park.

01:13:10.767 --> 01:13:15.146
I feared you might try
to harm our beloved Uncle Dave,

01:13:15.271 --> 01:13:19.692
so I raced over here as fast
as I could to try and stop you,

01:13:19.817 --> 01:13:24.155
but alas, it was too late.

01:13:29.244 --> 01:13:31.913
Get him all the way in the car.

01:13:41.297 --> 01:13:43.299
Take it.

01:13:43.424 --> 01:13:47.303
Take it.
You worried about fingerprints?

01:13:47.428 --> 01:13:50.849
Forget it.
Look at the gun. It's yours.

01:13:52.141 --> 01:13:54.143
Give me your weapon.

01:14:02.902 --> 01:14:05.864
Throw that gun in the street!

01:14:08.199 --> 01:14:10.577
Close the door and get over there!

01:14:43.526 --> 01:14:46.279
Hold on, Uncle Dave. Damn it!

01:14:51.701 --> 01:14:53.745
Don't you die on me, man.

01:15:05.798 --> 01:15:09.928
I got an emergency out here.
It's a gut shot. Come on!

01:15:14.182 --> 01:15:16.351
That was Uncle Dave.

01:15:23.525 --> 01:15:26.027
- Pressure?
- 90 over 40 and dropping.

01:15:26.152 --> 01:15:29.489
I got to get his pressure up.
Let's go, guys.

01:15:29.614 --> 01:15:33.034
I need oxygen. Let's go.
On three. One, two, three.

01:15:33.117 --> 01:15:36.579
Get an arterial line in him.
Any medical history?

01:15:36.704 --> 01:15:39.582
I've been shot before,
but it's no big deal.

01:15:39.707 --> 01:15:42.794
- Where's the coffee machine?
- Down the hall.

01:15:42.919 --> 01:15:47.382
This is an all-city alert for
a suspect in the Thornton shooting.

01:15:47.507 --> 01:15:50.468
Suspect is an
African-American male...

01:16:05.859 --> 01:16:08.319
You hear some black guy
shot Uncle Dave?

01:16:08.444 --> 01:16:11.114
- No?
- Come on, let's get out of here.

01:16:36.139 --> 01:16:39.058
Did you hear?
Somebody shot Dave Thornton.

01:16:39.184 --> 01:16:42.228
- Somebody shot Uncle Dave?
- Is there a TV here?

01:16:42.353 --> 01:16:44.480
Yes, of course.

01:16:46.816 --> 01:16:50.445
Authorities believe
that Foley attacked Uncle Dave

01:16:50.570 --> 01:16:53.615
in retaliation
for some personal rejection.

01:16:53.740 --> 01:16:58.453
The much-loved Uncle Dave is
undergoing surgery at this moment.

01:16:58.536 --> 01:17:02.040
According to hospital sources,
the prognosis is bleak.

01:17:02.165 --> 01:17:05.001
How does a psycho like that
live with himself?

01:17:05.835 --> 01:17:07.837
Janice, Axel. Get out of the park.

01:17:07.921 --> 01:17:11.674
They're going to kill whoever
knows about Roger Fry's note.

01:17:11.799 --> 01:17:16.304
Janice can't come to the phone
right now. Can I take a message?

01:17:16.387 --> 01:17:19.098
- If you do anything...
- It'll be your fault.

01:17:19.182 --> 01:17:22.018
I want you at Wonder World
within the hour.

01:17:22.143 --> 01:17:24.812
Come to the main gate
alone and unarmed.

01:17:24.938 --> 01:17:28.107
- And bring the Mint paper.
- Then you let us go?

01:17:28.233 --> 01:17:30.818
If you don't show up here
in a half-hour,

01:17:30.902 --> 01:17:34.489
alone, unarmed and with no cops,
I kill your friend.

01:17:34.614 --> 01:17:37.575
And it wouldn't
be the first time, would it?

01:17:43.039 --> 01:17:46.918
We have an amateur video
of the incident this afternoon

01:17:47.043 --> 01:17:49.879
involving Uncle Dave's assassin,
Axel Foley.

01:17:52.048 --> 01:17:56.135
All right, don't shoot.
I'm putting my gun down.

01:17:56.261 --> 01:18:01.432
I'm putting it on the ground.
I'm not armed. Don't shoot.

01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:06.688
That was an amateur video
shot earlier today by a tourist.

01:18:19.784 --> 01:18:22.453
Would you please
take special care of my car?

01:18:22.537 --> 01:18:24.998
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

01:18:41.764 --> 01:18:44.017
- Shit!
- Ackwell...

01:18:44.142 --> 01:18:46.352
Serge, I need a weapon.

01:18:46.477 --> 01:18:49.564
I don't have any weapon.
I take all back.

01:18:49.689 --> 01:18:53.026
- What about this?
- This is the floor model.

01:18:53.151 --> 01:18:56.571
People been breathing on it,
coughing on it...

01:18:56.696 --> 01:18:59.490
Serge, I need a weapon now.

01:19:00.658 --> 01:19:04.871
Donny. Donny, Ackwell
in some kind of rush, OK?

01:19:04.996 --> 01:19:10.335
So take the Annihilator
and wash it off with some cologne,

01:19:10.418 --> 01:19:15.089
and take the case and make sure
it's nice and pretty.

01:19:15.173 --> 01:19:16.341
It's Corinthian leather.

01:19:18.092 --> 01:19:22.347
- Billy, Axel calling.
- Axel, listen. Am I your friend?

01:19:22.430 --> 01:19:26.059
I'm sure you can explain,
or maybe you can't explain,

01:19:26.184 --> 01:19:28.520
but you've got to turn yourself in.

01:19:28.645 --> 01:19:33.191
- I'm going to Wonder World.
- No! Wait for me! Axel!

01:20:09.227 --> 01:20:12.564
Put your arms out
and hold for a pat-down.

01:20:18.611 --> 01:20:20.613
Foley just arrived, sir.

01:20:20.738 --> 01:20:23.783
Take him to control.
We have Foley.

01:20:25.451 --> 01:20:26.911
Come on.

01:20:27.036 --> 01:20:30.164
- How much do you want run?
- All of it.

01:20:32.542 --> 01:20:35.336
- Are you OK?
- Let's have the paper.

01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:39.757
There's a Porsche by the front gate.
There's a phone inside.

01:20:39.883 --> 01:20:42.177
When she calls, I'll give you it.

01:20:42.302 --> 01:20:45.805
- I don't think so.
- Then we got a stalemate.

01:20:45.889 --> 01:20:47.932
Not quite. Orrin...

01:20:48.016 --> 01:20:51.978
We kill you both.
The paper don't mean jack shit.

01:20:52.103 --> 01:20:55.481
How you know I didn't mail
it to the Secret Service?

01:20:55.607 --> 01:20:59.194
- He's bluffing.
- You think so? Call me.

01:20:59.319 --> 01:21:04.574
Orrin, I know how cops think.
The note is in the car.

01:21:07.327 --> 01:21:09.954
The keys, Foley.

01:21:11.748 --> 01:21:13.875
Give me the fucking keys.

01:21:28.223 --> 01:21:31.726
- Drop that fucking gun!
- Again?

01:21:31.809 --> 01:21:33.853
Drop it!

01:21:36.481 --> 01:21:39.067
Axel, what are you doing here?

01:22:25.613 --> 01:22:29.200
- What happened?
- It's the coolant safety system.

01:22:29.325 --> 01:22:31.995
Protects the mainframe
in case of fire.

01:22:32.078 --> 01:22:35.790
- How do we get it open?
- We can't. Not from this side.

01:23:30.929 --> 01:23:34.224
He's trying to use an outside line.
Do something!

01:23:35.934 --> 01:23:38.061
Hello, police?

01:23:38.853 --> 01:23:40.230
Shit!

01:23:40.355 --> 01:23:42.190
Foley's loose in the park!

01:23:42.315 --> 01:23:45.860
I repeat...
Foley's loose in the park! Get him!

01:23:50.448 --> 01:23:52.659
Mr. DeWald!

01:23:52.784 --> 01:23:55.161
We gotta do something.
Call for help!

01:23:55.286 --> 01:23:58.540
There's just the modem line
for the computers.

01:24:00.083 --> 01:24:02.627
I got it!
Just let the computer dial...

01:24:02.752 --> 01:24:07.632
The phone would just ring and ring.
That's it. What good would that be?

01:24:09.217 --> 01:24:12.804
A lot of good.
We can call Flint's pager.

01:24:23.106 --> 01:24:28.570
Foley is in Hometown Square. Repeat,
Foley is in Hometown Square.

01:26:10.630 --> 01:26:12.799
Foley is heading for Alien Attack.

01:26:29.107 --> 01:26:34.070
Attention. This is a red alert.
Aliens are invading the city.

01:26:34.153 --> 01:26:37.824
Board the subway trains
for immediate evacuation.

01:27:35.465 --> 01:27:37.467
He ran up those stairs.

01:27:55.527 --> 01:27:57.987
I need that right away!

01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:01.699
Damn it. Not again. Excuse me.

01:28:04.536 --> 01:28:06.454
Dispatch, this is Flint.

01:28:06.579 --> 01:28:10.667
Trace that number
that keeps calling me. 555-4085.

01:28:10.792 --> 01:28:14.462
It's a computer line
at the Wonder World theme park.

01:28:14.587 --> 01:28:17.590
Call and tell them
their computer's broken.

01:28:17.715 --> 01:28:20.677
We tried,
but all the voice lines are down.

01:28:20.802 --> 01:28:23.096
Must be that Uncle Dave shooting.

01:28:24.639 --> 01:28:28.560
- Jesus! Somebody shot Uncle Dave?
- Some fool named Axel Foley.

01:28:57.797 --> 01:29:00.091
Where the fuck is he?

01:30:50.618 --> 01:30:54.497
Get to a phone and call the police.
I'll try and find Axel.

01:30:54.622 --> 01:30:56.457
All right!

01:31:14.767 --> 01:31:16.769
There you are. Foley's...

01:32:00.563 --> 01:32:04.692
Name's Wild Bill Rosewood.
I'm the sheriff of this town.

01:32:24.546 --> 01:32:28.174
What the hell happened here?

01:32:38.226 --> 01:32:39.185
Shit!

01:32:41.896 --> 01:32:43.898
Damn it!

01:32:56.035 --> 01:32:58.413
Turn that fucking song off!

01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:24.999
Foley? You all right?

01:34:26.167 --> 01:34:30.421
- Hello, Fulbright.
- You hurt bad?

01:34:32.924 --> 01:34:38.721
Look, Foley, I guess I owe you
an apology. You were right.

01:34:38.847 --> 01:34:43.017
I got Sanderson handcuffed
in the car. He was in on it, right?

01:34:44.352 --> 01:34:47.522
I found out about another partner
that was in on it.

01:34:50.608 --> 01:34:52.402
So long, Foley.

01:35:12.213 --> 01:35:14.215
You OK?

01:35:15.550 --> 01:35:19.470
Any chance you can explain
any of this to me?

01:35:20.638 --> 01:35:23.183
Like why the fuck am I shot?

01:35:29.063 --> 01:35:31.065
You guys OK?

01:35:35.612 --> 01:35:39.407
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

01:35:43.578 --> 01:35:46.164
I wonder what time the park opens.

01:35:59.636 --> 01:36:02.222
He needs medical attention.

01:36:07.060 --> 01:36:10.021
- Does this hurt?
- Don't touch it.

01:36:17.153 --> 01:36:24.661
I am so happy to introduce to you
our new character in Wonder World,

01:36:24.786 --> 01:36:29.916
named after a man who's most
responsible for my being here today.

01:36:34.087 --> 01:36:36.673
Axel Fox!

01:37:00.321 --> 01:37:05.159
I don't think you've seen
the Tunnel of Love ride, have you?

01:37:06.327 --> 01:37:10.248
I didn't know y'all had a
Tunnel of Love ride in Wonder World.

01:37:10.373 --> 01:37:12.417
There will be shortly.
