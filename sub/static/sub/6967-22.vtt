00:35.051 --> 00:36.643
- What ho!
- What ho!

00:36.753 --> 00:39.984
Hey, Lazard, why do the night guys
get a piece like you,

00:40.056 --> 00:42.388
when we're stuck with old eel breath?

00:42.492 --> 00:44.858
It's fate, detective,

00:44.961 --> 00:48.021
conspiring to keep us apart.

00:48.098 --> 00:50.692
All right. I'm outta here.

00:53.069 --> 00:55.060
See ya.

00:55.171 --> 00:57.230
See ya tomorrow.

01:19.262 --> 01:21.389
You all right?

01:22.732 --> 01:23.824
You lost?

01:29.672 --> 01:34.075
I got her in the holding room,
but she's not talking, at least not to me.

01:34.144 --> 01:36.704
You're asking me
cos you know I'm good with kids?

01:36.813 --> 01:38.872
Yeah, a regular Mr Greenjeans.

01:45.255 --> 01:46.722
Hi.

01:46.823 --> 01:48.882
This is Detective Barbala.

01:48.958 --> 01:51.688
He's gonna help you find your parents.

01:51.761 --> 01:53.922
Hiya, sweetheart.

01:54.030 --> 01:56.726
- What's your name?
- Michelle.

01:59.469 --> 02:02.267
Everything's gonna be all right, OK?

02:02.338 --> 02:04.465
Don't be scared now.

02:10.446 --> 02:11.276
Michelle what?

02:13.583 --> 02:17.110
You said your first name was Michelle.
What's your last name?

02:17.187 --> 02:18.552
Bishop.

02:18.755 --> 02:19.949
Bishop.

02:20.056 --> 02:22.581
Michelle... Bishop.

02:23.359 --> 02:26.988
And where do you live, Michelle?
Here in Buffalo?

02:33.770 --> 02:36.102
What was that? Did you hear that?

02:45.281 --> 02:47.943
Somebody call an ambulance!

03:55.985 --> 03:59.853
- How'd you hear about us?
- My brother. My brother's a cop.

03:59.956 --> 04:01.389
Baltimore.

04:01.457 --> 04:03.891
He told me about your work
on the Tooms case.

04:03.993 --> 04:07.394
He said you got a good feel
for things... out of the ordinary.

04:07.463 --> 04:12.765
Look, the truth is Barbala never won
any popularity contests here at the One Four.

04:13.403 --> 04:15.462
But he's still a cop, you know?

04:17.173 --> 04:19.869
I guess that's why I can'tjust let this rest.

04:19.976 --> 04:24.436
You said there was one witness -
a little girl. What did she say happened?

04:24.514 --> 04:26.982
She said there was another man in the room.

04:27.050 --> 04:30.486
- It stands to reason somebody was...
- I was right outside.

04:30.586 --> 04:33.180
There was nobody else
except Barbala and the kid.

04:33.256 --> 04:38.057
- You didn't get a description of the man?
- I'm telling you, there was no one else.

04:39.062 --> 04:40.620
Listen.

04:41.431 --> 04:45.197
The department's treating this as a suicide,
but I knew this guy.

04:45.268 --> 04:47.702
There's no way he did himself.

04:47.804 --> 04:51.501
Well, was he depressed
or under psychiatric care of any kind?

04:51.808 --> 04:53.070
Nah.

04:53.142 --> 04:58.341
Only time he ever looked at himself was in
the mirror, and he always liked what he saw.

05:04.120 --> 05:06.850
Plus, jumpers tend to open windows
before they jump.

05:06.923 --> 05:08.550
Where's the kid now?

05:08.658 --> 05:11.821
She was released an hour ago.
Her mother picked her up.

05:11.894 --> 05:14.954
You don't think the girl
had anything to do with it?

05:15.064 --> 05:16.929
I don't know what to believe.

05:17.033 --> 05:21.970
Eight years I've been on this force.
I've seen a lot of strange things, but this kid...

05:22.872 --> 05:25.898
Something's just not right about her.

05:26.642 --> 05:29.770
- Did he have long hair or short hair?
- Short.

05:33.483 --> 05:35.542
Like that?

05:36.352 --> 05:39.549
Was his hair dark like mine,
or lighter like yours?

05:39.655 --> 05:41.520
Like mine.

05:45.061 --> 05:49.054
- How about a beard or a mustache?
- Mustache.

05:49.799 --> 05:51.892
You got a funny one?

05:53.703 --> 05:55.796
Like this?

05:58.574 --> 06:00.064
Or this?

06:03.913 --> 06:06.347
Whoa. What happened?

06:07.583 --> 06:09.278
Weird.

06:09.352 --> 06:11.411
I didn't even hit a key.

06:12.989 --> 06:15.321
Must be a glitch in the new software.

06:16.726 --> 06:20.628
Michelle, was his mustache like that?

06:24.200 --> 06:27.727
Do you have any idea
how your daughter might have gotten there?

06:27.837 --> 06:33.298
Buffalo's half an hour away by train,
and the station is a five-minute car ride.

06:34.577 --> 06:38.138
When I came home
Mrs Dougherty was locked in the wine cellar.

06:38.214 --> 06:40.307
I called the police immediately.

06:40.383 --> 06:43.409
- And Mrs Dougherty is?
- Michelle's nanny.

06:43.519 --> 06:48.718
Her latest that is. She's already gone through
four this year, and it's only April.

06:49.792 --> 06:51.726
What seems to be the problem?

06:54.263 --> 06:56.356
Michelle is the problem.

07:00.169 --> 07:02.228
How do you mean?

07:02.338 --> 07:05.967
As hard as it is for a mother to admit,

07:06.943 --> 07:09.070
Michelle is a disturbed child.

07:10.079 --> 07:12.741
I know this sounds terrible to say,

07:12.815 --> 07:16.012
but the truth is that
sometimes she frightens me.

07:17.753 --> 07:18.845
Frightens you how?

07:20.756 --> 07:23.247
She's not like other girls, Agent Scully.

07:26.229 --> 07:27.253
Tell me.

07:28.965 --> 07:31.024
She just isn't.

07:31.634 --> 07:33.693
She doesn't have any friends.

07:34.470 --> 07:36.563
She hardly ever smiles.

07:38.274 --> 07:41.072
It breaks my heart, but I can't comfort her.

07:43.513 --> 07:46.448
She says she sees things that I can't see.

07:46.516 --> 07:48.984
She hears people yelling in her head.

07:52.121 --> 07:54.112
Last summer we had to cover our pool.

07:54.223 --> 07:57.852
Jim was trying to teach her how to swim,

07:57.927 --> 08:02.694
but every time Michelle would get close
to the water, she would start to scream.

08:02.798 --> 08:05.892
Scream like you've never heard
in all your life.

08:06.903 --> 08:09.030
Your husband, where is he now?

08:10.306 --> 08:12.399
We're divorced.

08:21.317 --> 08:23.410
Mrs Bishop?

08:23.486 --> 08:28.423
This is the man Michelle said she saw
at the police station. Do you recognize him?

08:28.491 --> 08:30.152
No, I'm sorry.

08:30.927 --> 08:34.226
She also mentioned a friend,
someone named Sheila.

08:34.297 --> 08:36.958
- Do you know who that is?
- That would be Dr Braun.

08:37.099 --> 08:40.557
She's the developmental psychologist
at Brylin Hospital.

08:40.669 --> 08:42.933
Michelle sees her twice a week.

08:50.947 --> 08:53.074
Look at that.

08:53.149 --> 08:55.743
Looks like a hawk. A falcon.

08:55.851 --> 08:57.910
It's beautiful.

08:57.987 --> 09:01.514
- It's called origami.
- Japanese paper folding.

09:01.591 --> 09:04.185
Where did she learn how to do that?

09:04.293 --> 09:06.352
I have no idea.

09:10.466 --> 09:13.765
- Harry, you'll put that face into the system?
- As we speak.

09:13.869 --> 09:15.996
Can you drive Scully into the city?

09:16.138 --> 09:19.335
- Wait. We have an autopsy at seven.
- That's your department.

09:19.408 --> 09:23.674
I'm gonna go to Brylin Hospital,
see if I can have a chat with Michelle's shrink.

09:24.513 --> 09:27.573
And check for burns or lesions
on Barbala's body.

09:28.751 --> 09:30.412
Why?

09:30.519 --> 09:35.320
Psychokinesis is usually
associated with an electrical charge.

09:35.391 --> 09:39.885
Are you saying Michelle possesses the ability
to psychically project her own will?

09:39.962 --> 09:43.830
How else could a 60lb kid
throw a 200lb detective out the window?

09:50.106 --> 09:52.404
No, I don't recognize him.

09:52.508 --> 09:54.738
I have no idea who this man is.

09:56.212 --> 09:59.443
- Could Michelle have fabricated him?
- Quite possibly.

09:59.548 --> 10:04.645
As with many dissociative disorders,
the intensity of the patient's emotions

10:04.754 --> 10:08.053
is often too much
for one personality to process.

10:08.190 --> 10:11.250
So, in defense,
part of the personality splits itself off.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.726
As in schizophrenia?

10:14.830 --> 10:17.628
I'm afraid Michelle's diagnosis
is not that simple.

10:17.733 --> 10:22.636
You see, my primary challenge has been
to discover the source of her extreme rage.

10:22.738 --> 10:26.572
In most cases,
it's a traumatic event in the patient's past.

10:26.642 --> 10:28.872
And in Michelle's case?

10:32.581 --> 10:37.416
Occasionally I would leave Michelle alone
for part of our sessions...

10:39.088 --> 10:41.181
with this doll.

10:41.857 --> 10:45.054
Each time a new doll, anatomically intact.

10:45.161 --> 10:49.894
And each time she dismembers
and disfigures it in exactly the same way.

10:49.999 --> 10:54.493
First I thought she was being abused,
but after some sessions with her parents

10:54.603 --> 10:58.835
I became convinced there was
something else behind Michelle's anxiety.

10:58.908 --> 11:03.436
Something much deeper, much more elusive.

11:03.512 --> 11:06.572
- Any theories?
- Frankly, no.

11:06.649 --> 11:08.844
I'm at a loss.

11:08.918 --> 11:12.285
Have you tried deep-progression hypnosis?

11:12.388 --> 11:16.825
I've found hypnosis
an unreliable approach at best.

11:16.892 --> 11:19.520
OK. So how have you been treating Michelle?

11:19.628 --> 11:23.894
The Thorazine has been effective
in regulating her more bizarre behavior.

11:23.999 --> 11:26.126
I'm sure.

11:26.235 --> 11:31.502
Have you observed any unexplained
phenomena in Michelle's presence?

11:31.607 --> 11:33.700
Unexplained phenomena?

11:33.809 --> 11:38.439
Inordinate physical strength,
psychic ability, telekinesis?

11:39.648 --> 11:42.116
You're joking, of course.

11:47.256 --> 11:51.317
I have a patient waiting, Agent Mulder.
If you'll excuse me.

11:52.561 --> 11:55.621
Note postmortem examination
is being conducted

11:55.698 --> 11:59.862
eleven hours and 45 minutes
after subject was pronounced.

12:03.839 --> 12:08.071
Note... raised... lesion

12:08.144 --> 12:11.910
approximately seven centimeters
below sternum.

12:13.048 --> 12:17.075
Deep necrosis
inconsistent with cause of death,

12:17.153 --> 12:19.485
as pronounced by Dr Guilder.

12:20.689 --> 12:23.920
And suggest localized electrocution.

12:25.661 --> 12:29.791
But a further tissue analysis
will be necessary.

12:29.899 --> 12:31.958
Excuse me?

12:32.067 --> 12:34.126
Could I talk to you for a second?

12:34.203 --> 12:36.296
I just started the autopsy.

12:36.372 --> 12:39.933
Yeah, I don't think he's going anywhere.

12:42.077 --> 12:45.569
Will you take a couple for scale, please?

12:47.483 --> 12:49.542
Thank you. Be right back.

12:53.489 --> 12:55.548
So what do you think?

12:57.126 --> 13:00.289
- Looks like a match.
- Yeah.

13:00.362 --> 13:05.026
Name's Charlie Morris. Officer Charlie Morris.
Used to work Narcotics out at the Two Seven.

13:05.134 --> 13:09.002
- D'you know him?
- No. Before my time.

13:09.104 --> 13:12.039
Well, where is he now?
Has he been transferred?

13:12.141 --> 13:14.200
You could say that.

13:14.310 --> 13:17.302
Agent Scully,
this guy's been dead for nine years.

13:18.981 --> 13:21.347
Which means that little girl

13:21.550 --> 13:23.609
saw a ghost.

13:39.869 --> 13:41.962
This way, please.

13:43.939 --> 13:46.271
Just by the side of my desk.

13:49.678 --> 13:53.842
He was killed in Chinatown, gangland style,
allegedly by the Triads,

13:53.949 --> 13:56.144
although no arrests were ever made.

13:56.218 --> 13:59.244
If you're gonna tell me
Michelle saw a poltergeist...

13:59.355 --> 14:02.347
You're the one
that found the lesion on Barbala's body

14:02.424 --> 14:06.417
that could have been caused by
a concentration of electrothermal energy.

14:06.495 --> 14:09.020
"Could have been"
being the operative phrase.

14:09.098 --> 14:12.067
I won't know for sure
until the lab results are in...

14:12.167 --> 14:17.503
Why's it so hard to believe, when all evidence
suggests extraordinary phenomena?

14:17.640 --> 14:19.904
Because sometimes...

14:20.009 --> 14:23.172
- What?
- Looking for extreme possibilities

14:23.245 --> 14:27.705
makes you blind to the probable explanation
right in front of you.

14:28.651 --> 14:32.246
This is the face that Michelle Bishop saw.

14:32.321 --> 14:35.313
She walked by here
and saw the face of Charlie Morris.

14:35.424 --> 14:38.916
Which means there were no ghosts
flying around the precinct.

14:39.028 --> 14:41.792
D'you have the report
describing Morris's death?

14:41.864 --> 14:45.265
Yeah. I have what's been declassified. Why?

14:45.334 --> 14:50.203
- Does it describe how he was murdered?
- Yes, I told you. It was a signature hit.

14:50.272 --> 14:52.467
Give me the grizzly details.

14:56.412 --> 15:00.815
"His arm was severed just below
the shoulder, presumably by a chain saw,

15:00.883 --> 15:03.215
and his right eye was gouged out."

15:03.285 --> 15:06.948
This is what Michelle did to a dozen dolls
in her shrink's office.

15:07.056 --> 15:10.150
Hell of a coincidence, wouldn't you say?

15:10.259 --> 15:13.228
I think we should find out
more about Charlie Morris.

15:13.295 --> 15:19.131
I got the address of his partner on the force.
Hopefully he can tell us something.

15:40.656 --> 15:44.922
Detective Fiore? We're with the FBI.
Can we talk to you for a minute?

15:46.161 --> 15:48.254
D'you know this man?

16:01.677 --> 16:05.272
Do you mind if we do this out here?
I don't wanna wake my wife.

16:05.347 --> 16:07.212
This won't take long.

16:07.316 --> 16:11.013
Yeah, sure I know him.
That's Charlie... Charlie Morris.

16:11.120 --> 16:12.553
You two were partners.

16:12.621 --> 16:16.216
Yeah, we rode together
his first nine months out of the Academy.

16:16.325 --> 16:20.728
What can you tell us about the circumstances
surrounding his death?

16:29.938 --> 16:34.432
That matter is still under investigation,
and so I can't comment on it.

16:34.543 --> 16:39.207
Detective, we're under the direct authority
of Captain Gersham at the 14th Precinct.

16:39.314 --> 16:43.216
14th Precinct?
I never worked out of the One Four.

16:43.318 --> 16:47.914
- What's all this about?
- We believe the death of Detective Barbala

16:47.990 --> 16:51.221
can be linked to the death of
Officer Morris nine years ago.

16:51.326 --> 16:55.524
Linked how? I thought this Barbala
flipped his wig and jumped out a window.

16:55.597 --> 16:58.998
- Did you know the detective?
- By reputation.

16:59.068 --> 17:02.799
- What's this got to do with Charlie?
- That's why we need your help.

17:02.938 --> 17:05.873
The report said
Officer Morris was killed off duty.

17:05.973 --> 17:09.535
That's right. Best we can figure,
it was some kind of payback.

17:09.611 --> 17:12.876
- For what?
- Around that time Organized Crime

17:12.981 --> 17:15.244
was doing a major sweep in Chinatown.

17:15.349 --> 17:17.011
- The Triads?
- Yeah.

17:17.086 --> 17:19.781
Some heavy busts went down
against the Woo Shing Woo.

17:19.887 --> 17:22.789
Lot of smack never made it to the street.

17:22.891 --> 17:26.417
There were some pissed-off people
playing mahjong that week.

17:26.494 --> 17:30.056
So you think Charlie Morris was killed
as a warning to back off?

17:31.567 --> 17:34.434
I think they picked a cop, any cop,

17:34.503 --> 17:36.198
and they whacked him.

17:36.271 --> 17:40.071
- Who is it, Tony?
- It's nothing to worry about, honey.

17:40.175 --> 17:44.271
Just some people from the FBI
asking about a case I'm working.

17:44.379 --> 17:48.247
- Sir, would you mind...
- It's the weekend. You guys mind?

17:48.317 --> 17:52.014
You can get me at the squad
first thing Monday morning, OK?

17:52.087 --> 17:53.520
Good luck.

17:59.228 --> 18:01.696
Is it me, or did we just get the brush-off?

18:01.797 --> 18:04.527
- Did you notice her hands?
- What?

18:04.633 --> 18:09.229
He says she was sleeping,
but her hands were dusted with baking flour.

18:15.144 --> 18:17.408
It's not a big deal, all right?

18:17.479 --> 18:21.643
Don't jerk yourself around, Tony.
You're acting like a little bug.

18:21.717 --> 18:24.447
- They were FBI!
- So what?

18:26.221 --> 18:29.918
They start sniffing around too much,
they're gonna turn something up.

18:30.058 --> 18:34.552
Relax. They're just people like us
going through the motions.

18:34.663 --> 18:37.689
Yeah? Then how are they
connecting Charlie to Barbala?

18:37.766 --> 18:39.859
And what do they know?

18:40.836 --> 18:42.701
Nothing.

18:48.277 --> 18:51.178
Come on. We're going to Citibank right now.

18:51.280 --> 18:53.578
- For what?
- The safety box!

18:55.651 --> 19:00.486
And what shall we do, Tony? Make
a donation to the Little Sisters for the Poor?

19:00.556 --> 19:02.786
Dump it somewhere.

19:02.891 --> 19:08.124
Tony, there's only two of us left now.
That's over a million each.

19:08.197 --> 19:10.290
Take it all! I don't care!

19:10.365 --> 19:13.960
Do your dream on the beach in Costa Rica,
or wherever you wanna do it.

19:16.338 --> 19:18.397
You think I like this?

19:18.974 --> 19:22.410
Selling disability insurance to morons?

19:22.511 --> 19:26.003
"Well, sir, what if you should
break your neck on the shore,

19:26.148 --> 19:28.309
or lose your leg in a car crash?"

19:30.319 --> 19:32.719
You listen to me, Tony.

19:32.788 --> 19:36.986
We agreed to wait ten years
and that is exactly what we're gonna do.

19:37.125 --> 19:40.822
I listened to you once before
and look what happened.

19:40.929 --> 19:44.956
Nobody! Not me, not Barbala,
wanted to see Charlie wind up like that.

19:45.033 --> 19:47.558
We just tried to scare some sense into him.

19:51.139 --> 19:53.198
It was an accident.

19:53.308 --> 19:55.367
End of story.

19:56.511 --> 19:59.344
And you better pull yourself together, Tony.

20:14.196 --> 20:16.255
Excuse me, sir?

21:16.491 --> 21:17.924
Hey!

21:20.796 --> 21:22.491
Open the door!

21:22.931 --> 21:25.331
Open the door!

21:26.601 --> 21:28.330
Open the door!

21:40.849 --> 21:43.079
Hey! Open the door!

21:45.053 --> 21:47.112
For God's sake, help me!

22:27.262 --> 22:29.127
Hey.

22:30.098 --> 22:32.794
Get your hands off me, all right.

22:32.901 --> 22:36.860
A patrol unit picked her up
a few blocks away from the bus stop.

22:36.938 --> 22:38.599
What's going on?

22:41.009 --> 22:43.102
We don't know.

22:43.178 --> 22:47.444
All we know is that your daughter has
witnessed two deaths in the past two days.

22:48.917 --> 22:52.080
She's only eight.
She couldn't have done anything.

22:52.154 --> 22:55.954
Mrs Bishop,
no one is accusing Michelle of anything.

22:56.024 --> 22:58.117
She's just a little girl.

23:00.962 --> 23:03.226
Is there anything you have not told us?

23:03.331 --> 23:05.822
Is there anything at all you can think of

23:05.934 --> 23:09.199
that might shed some light
on what happened tonight?

23:09.304 --> 23:11.238
No.

23:13.542 --> 23:17.444
This police station
has a designated room at the Sheraton.

23:17.546 --> 23:20.709
An officer will take
you and Michelle over there.

23:21.783 --> 23:24.911
Why is this happening to us? Why?

23:29.624 --> 23:31.717
Can I talk to you for a minute?

23:33.528 --> 23:35.587
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

23:40.602 --> 23:44.732
Listen to this. You know that guy
that bought it tonight? Leon Felder?

23:44.806 --> 23:49.209
Before he started peddling life insurance,
he was a cop out of the One Four.

23:49.277 --> 23:51.438
Guess who his partner used to be?

23:51.580 --> 23:53.639
Rudy Barbala.

23:55.784 --> 23:57.843
Four cops.

23:58.653 --> 24:00.985
Three of whom are now dead.

24:01.990 --> 24:06.654
Their only connection being a drug bust
in Chinatown almost nine years ago.

24:06.761 --> 24:09.229
And a little girl from Orchard Park.

24:10.599 --> 24:14.968
Morris, Fiore, Barbala and Felder.

24:16.138 --> 24:18.402
What's wrong with this picture?

24:19.841 --> 24:23.607
For one thing, Fiore said
he only knew Barbala by reputation.

24:23.678 --> 24:26.647
Right. So why would he say that?

24:26.715 --> 24:28.376
I don't know.

24:33.889 --> 24:35.982
What?

24:36.391 --> 24:39.690
There's a page gone
from Morris's homicide file.

24:39.794 --> 24:43.127
- Where could it be?
- Is there a log sheet?

24:43.231 --> 24:45.290
Should be.

24:45.834 --> 24:47.699
Yeah.

24:49.204 --> 24:52.298
Tony Fiore... Checked out this afternoon.

25:00.949 --> 25:04.715
Mrs Fiore, we're sorry for the early hour,
but is your husband home?

25:04.819 --> 25:08.448
No, he's not. He never came home last night.

25:08.523 --> 25:10.650
May we come in?

25:32.280 --> 25:33.508
Scully.

25:40.555 --> 25:42.455
Look familiar?

25:44.726 --> 25:47.194
He said he was working a double shift,

25:47.295 --> 25:51.925
but when I called the precinct,
he wasn't scheduled.

25:52.867 --> 25:55.131
It's just not like him not to call.

25:55.203 --> 26:00.334
Does your husband have family or friends in
the area he might go to if he were in trouble?

26:05.113 --> 26:07.172
I've been on the phone all night.

26:08.283 --> 26:10.751
Is he in any trouble?

26:10.819 --> 26:13.982
Did you husband ever mention a detective
named Rudy Barbala?

26:14.089 --> 26:17.183
Or an ex-police officer named Leon Felder?

26:18.793 --> 26:20.624
I don't think so.

26:20.762 --> 26:25.096
Someone you might have had dinner with
once, a friend of Tony's from work,

26:25.166 --> 26:26.827
a name you can't remember?

26:26.935 --> 26:30.530
We don't normally socialize with other cops.

26:30.605 --> 26:34.006
Mrs Fiore, I couldn't help noticing
your origami collection.

26:34.109 --> 26:35.974
Did you do these yourself?

26:36.044 --> 26:38.410
Oh, no. Not me. No.

26:38.513 --> 26:40.572
That was Charlie's hobby.

26:40.649 --> 26:43.812
- Charlie?
- My first husband.

26:43.918 --> 26:46.944
He was born in Japan.
His father was stationed there.

26:48.456 --> 26:50.788
Not Charlie Morris, Tony's ex-partner.

26:50.859 --> 26:53.054
Yeah.

26:54.729 --> 26:58.028
I was waiting for him to come home, too,
nine years ago.

26:58.133 --> 27:00.192
Just like this.

27:01.870 --> 27:05.135
He was working on a whole set
from the painting.

27:05.206 --> 27:08.471
The only animal he never got to
was the giraffe.

27:08.576 --> 27:10.874
See right there, behind the zebra?

27:12.981 --> 27:15.245
Michelle is eight years old.

27:15.350 --> 27:19.377
That means she was conceived
at the same time Officer Morris was killed.

27:19.454 --> 27:22.651
Do me a favor, Mulder,
and let me say it. Reincarnation.

27:22.757 --> 27:26.557
Metempsychosis, transmigration,
re-embodiment - call it what you will.

27:26.628 --> 27:31.759
All based on the coincidence that Michelle
Bishop and Officer Morris practiced origami?

27:31.866 --> 27:34.027
What about the drawing, the dolls,

27:34.102 --> 27:38.004
and that Michelle witnessed two deaths
that can be tied to Morris?

27:38.073 --> 27:41.406
So you think he's back like Peter Proud
to avenge his murder?

27:41.476 --> 27:46.607
It's not so far-fetched, Scully. Reincarnation
is a basic tenet of many major religions.

27:46.681 --> 27:51.380
That still doesn't explain how
an eight-year-old girl can kill two grown men.

27:51.453 --> 27:55.822
Individuals with strong past-life memories
often exhibit psychic abilities.

27:55.924 --> 27:59.052
- ESP, telekinesis.
- So where does that leave us?

27:59.127 --> 28:03.587
One short step away from proving
the pre-existence of the human soul.

28:04.399 --> 28:08.096
On the count of fiive,
tell me where you are now.

28:08.203 --> 28:13.038
One... two... three... four... fiive.

28:15.310 --> 28:18.404
- Do you know where you are?
- Yes.

28:18.480 --> 28:20.539
Where?

28:20.648 --> 28:23.481
- Tell me where you are.
- At home.

28:24.352 --> 28:25.751
What time of day is it?

28:26.621 --> 28:27.679
Night-time.

28:27.756 --> 28:30.350
How old are you now?

28:30.458 --> 28:32.119
24.

28:33.661 --> 28:37.256
No! We can't! We can't do this! It's wrong!

28:37.332 --> 28:39.425
What's wrong? What can't you do?

28:42.170 --> 28:46.231
- It's all right. You can trust me.
- No, I can't! I can't!

28:47.375 --> 28:48.967
I can't! I can't!

28:49.077 --> 28:52.513
- This is dangerous.
- Dr Spitz has conducted many sessions...

28:52.580 --> 28:56.311
If this continues, it could push Michelle
deeper into withdrawal.

28:56.384 --> 28:59.251
Is it more dangerous
than pumping her with Thorazine?

28:59.320 --> 29:01.982
They're killing me! They're killing me!

29:02.090 --> 29:04.058
- That's enough!
- Mrs Bishop...

29:04.125 --> 29:06.184
No! No! No!

29:06.294 --> 29:08.489
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

29:08.563 --> 29:10.656
It's over. It's over!

29:18.473 --> 29:21.965
- They just left.
- We almost had it. We were right there.

29:22.110 --> 29:24.977
- I know.
- We'll have to try it again.

29:25.113 --> 29:27.980
Mrs Bishop won't go for that.
Not in this lifetime.

29:28.116 --> 29:30.175
Then we have to change her mind.

29:30.952 --> 29:33.079
How? And to what end?

29:33.154 --> 29:36.555
I mean, what exactly
do you hope to discover by all this?

29:36.624 --> 29:40.685
The truth. What really happened
to Charlie Morris nine years ago.

29:41.663 --> 29:43.597
We'll find the truth when we find Fiore.

29:43.698 --> 29:46.826
If we find Fiore. And if he's still alive.

29:48.336 --> 29:50.964
Scully, you saw what happened in there.

29:51.105 --> 29:55.337
What I saw
was some... traumatized little girl

29:55.410 --> 29:59.369
who, for no apparent reason,
has some connection to Charlie Morris.

29:59.447 --> 30:02.314
All evidence suggests
Michelle is Charlie Morris.

30:02.383 --> 30:05.011
- Mulder...
- Short of her growing a mustache,

30:05.153 --> 30:09.988
how much more apparent
does it have to become for you to accept it?

30:10.124 --> 30:11.751
OK.

30:11.826 --> 30:16.763
Let's just say that by some small miracle you
managed to convince Michelle's mother

30:16.831 --> 30:20.631
and the next hypnoregression
provides you with all you could hope for.

30:20.735 --> 30:24.603
No grand jury is gonna listen
to that kind of testimony.

30:25.540 --> 30:28.441
We still will not have an actionable case.

30:38.286 --> 30:41.949
On the count of fiive,
tell me where you are now.

30:42.023 --> 30:45.857
The inconclusive results
of Michelle's regression

30:45.960 --> 30:50.420
do not shake my basic belief in hypnosis
as a tool for psychological healing.

30:50.498 --> 30:55.868
Whether or not it offers us defiinitive proof
of previous lifetimes is another matter.

30:55.970 --> 30:58.564
However, in this particular case,

30:58.640 --> 31:02.599
all other explanations
seem to be even more wanting.

31:02.677 --> 31:05.305
- How old are you?
- 24.

31:05.413 --> 31:08.871
No, we can't! We can't do this! It's wrong!

31:08.983 --> 31:11.042
What's wrong? What can't you do?

31:15.456 --> 31:18.721
- And how old are you?
- 24.

31:19.093 --> 31:20.117
No, we ca!

31:24.098 --> 31:26.328
24.

31:37.345 --> 31:40.803
No, no, I... I wanna be here

31:40.882 --> 31:43.112
in case he shows up.

31:43.217 --> 31:45.310
Yeah, thanks again. I'll...

31:45.653 --> 31:48.315
I'll call you the minute I hear anything.

31:48.423 --> 31:50.482
OK, yeah. OK. Bye-bye.

32:13.314 --> 32:14.542
Tony!

32:20.088 --> 32:22.147
Tony!

32:58.092 --> 33:01.118
I checked the wind-up profiles.
They're up to speed.

33:01.195 --> 33:02.890
Which means?

33:02.964 --> 33:07.401
Whatever this image is,
it was recorded in that room with the girl.

33:07.502 --> 33:09.129
How is that possible?

33:09.203 --> 33:13.105
There was a documented case in the '70s
of a man from Porlock, Ohio,

33:13.174 --> 33:15.699
who could influence undeveloped film.

33:15.777 --> 33:19.213
He could create shapes on the negative
from his mind.

33:20.214 --> 33:25.242
I don't know how much noise I can clean up.
Depends on the strength of the latent image.

33:28.256 --> 33:30.224
I tracked him down.

33:30.324 --> 33:32.417
He's retired in Palm Beach.

33:32.527 --> 33:36.759
You were right, Agent Scully.
He backed up all his records on disc.

33:36.831 --> 33:38.992
Pathologists are paranoid by nature.

33:39.067 --> 33:42.161
He faxed me the missing page
from the autopsy report.

33:42.236 --> 33:43.931
Great.

33:46.074 --> 33:50.204
Well, apparently, Charlie Morris
did not die as a result of his wounds.

33:50.278 --> 33:54.271
Says here there was a frothing of fluid
in the respiratory tract.

33:54.382 --> 33:56.612
That indicates death by drowning.

33:56.684 --> 34:01.280
So he was drowned first, then mutilated
to make it look like a signature execution?

34:01.389 --> 34:04.586
Dr Yamaguchi said
there were no signs of submersion,

34:04.659 --> 34:09.027
such as goose skin or wrinkled flesh,
except for around the face and head.

34:09.097 --> 34:11.190
That's right.

34:11.264 --> 34:16.668
Suggesting that he was killed
in either a bathtub or a toilet. Except...

34:16.771 --> 34:18.398
Except for what?

34:19.907 --> 34:24.105
The marked bradycardia.
It indicates a raised plasma sodium level.

34:25.513 --> 34:27.811
He was killed in seawater.

34:47.702 --> 34:49.795
Anita!

34:51.839 --> 34:53.898
Anita!

34:57.043 --> 34:58.477
Tony!

34:58.613 --> 35:02.071
What's going on? Where have you been?
I know something's going on.

35:02.150 --> 35:04.277
I need you to listen to me right now.

35:04.352 --> 35:07.116
I need you to go upstairs and pack a bag.

35:07.221 --> 35:09.746
Why? What kind of trouble are you in?

35:09.857 --> 35:12.121
I think someone's trying to kill me.

35:12.226 --> 35:14.751
- Who?
- I don't know.

35:14.862 --> 35:17.092
Why would anybody want to kill you?

35:19.133 --> 35:23.502
- Tell me what's going on.
- Will you please just do what I'm asking you!

35:24.639 --> 35:26.266
Please.

35:26.340 --> 35:30.743
I'm your husband and I love you,
and I need you to trust me on this, OK?

35:52.400 --> 35:54.493
Almost there.

36:00.141 --> 36:03.907
What I've done is to map
the frequencies of the interference.

36:03.978 --> 36:07.880
Coefficients for sine on this monitor.
Cosine on that one.

36:07.949 --> 36:12.545
Now, using an algorithm program,
I can remove the frequencies...

36:13.554 --> 36:14.816
like this.

36:15.723 --> 36:17.554
Presto.

36:19.193 --> 36:20.888
What the hell?

36:28.269 --> 36:29.531
Mulder, what is it?

36:29.604 --> 36:34.166
- You said salt water, right?
- Right. So?

36:34.242 --> 36:38.110
So Charlie Morris was drowned
in his own tropical fish tank.

36:38.179 --> 36:40.374
That's what he last saw before he died.

36:40.448 --> 36:44.009
We better hope
Michelle Bishop is at home tucked in bed.

36:51.158 --> 36:53.023
Tony.

36:54.528 --> 36:58.055
Tony, somebody... somebody left this
on our doorstep tonight.

36:59.333 --> 37:01.392
Do you know who?

37:04.205 --> 37:06.070
Answer me, Tony!

37:16.350 --> 37:18.818
You stay here and keep the door closed.

38:12.006 --> 38:13.837
Tony, are you all right?

38:18.512 --> 38:20.605
Tony, answer me!

38:57.118 --> 38:59.450
Tony!

39:00.354 --> 39:04.120
Tony, please, who's there?
What's happening?

39:07.194 --> 39:08.456
Tony!

39:12.166 --> 39:13.758
Let me out of here!

39:20.608 --> 39:22.701
Mulder!

39:44.331 --> 39:46.799
They said they were just gonna talk to you.

39:46.901 --> 39:49.631
Talk some sense into you.

39:50.438 --> 39:52.531
What was I supposed to do?

39:54.842 --> 39:57.310
All you had to do was take the money, man!

39:57.378 --> 39:59.972
Why didn't you just take the money?

40:11.392 --> 40:13.155
Tony, get me out!

40:20.601 --> 40:22.865
What's going on? Let me out!

40:22.970 --> 40:26.770
- Go check upstairs.
- Please open the door. I'm scared!

40:35.049 --> 40:36.949
Michelle!

40:37.751 --> 40:40.015
This won't make right what happened.

40:43.157 --> 40:45.557
Please, I can't get out! Who's there?

40:45.626 --> 40:47.560
I can't get out! Please!

41:00.508 --> 41:02.476
Tony!

41:11.485 --> 41:13.248
Tony...

41:14.622 --> 41:15.850
I'm sorry.

41:18.058 --> 41:20.185
I knew what they did to Charlie.

41:24.265 --> 41:26.927
I was a part of it and I never said anything.

41:29.470 --> 41:31.097
I couldn't.

41:31.238 --> 41:32.865
Oh, no...

41:36.710 --> 41:38.803
I just wanted to take care of you.

41:41.048 --> 41:43.346
Who else would've taken care of you?

42:00.134 --> 42:02.466
Oh, God...

42:06.106 --> 42:08.700
No... No more...

42:13.280 --> 42:15.748
Please... please don't hurt him any more.

43:04.632 --> 43:08.363
Closing entry. File number X40271.

43:08.435 --> 43:12.394
Detective Anthony Fiore
pleaded guilty yesterday in federal court

43:12.506 --> 43:18.775
to charges of fiirst-degree murder after the
fact, grand larceny, and obstruction of justice.

43:18.846 --> 43:23.180
The deaths of Detective Rudy Barbala
and former police offiicer Leon Felder

43:23.250 --> 43:25.377
are being ruled as accidental.

43:25.452 --> 43:30.856
But their complicity in the murder of Charlie
Morris has been defiinitively established.

43:30.958 --> 43:33.950
No charges were brought
against Michelle Bishop,

43:34.028 --> 43:36.553
who, today, took her fiirst swimming lesson.

43:36.630 --> 43:40.430
She claims no memory
of the preceding events

43:40.534 --> 43:46.131
and her mother and Dr Braun have denied
my requests for a second past-life regression.

43:48.842 --> 43:52.938
End of fiield journal, April 19, 1994.

43:53.013 --> 43:56.449
