00:30.000 --> 00:31.120
Oh, God.

00:31.200 --> 00:33.479
How are you, Richard? Hot enough for you?

00:34.238 --> 00:35.558
Yeah.

00:42.555 --> 00:44.234
Hey, what are you doing?

00:44.834 --> 00:47.713
You dummy, why don't you watch
where you are going?

01:14.581 --> 01:16.821
Does this look like 10:00, or like 10:30?

01:16.901 --> 01:19.020
- Morning, Richard!
- Good morning.

01:19.060 --> 01:21.259
- You are a half hour late.
- Only a half hour?

01:21.339 --> 01:24.257
I am usually 45 minutes late.
I am early today.

01:24.897 --> 01:26.057
I see.

01:32.454 --> 01:35.253
- Are you going to join me today or what?
- Coming.

01:37.172 --> 01:39.371
Give me your money and your wallets.

01:39.611 --> 01:42.010
Get your ass out of here. It is too hot.

01:48.527 --> 01:51.966
Color me old-fashioned, Rich,
but I just love the park on a Sunday.

01:52.046 --> 01:55.964
I would love it more if we didn't have
to work today. Come on, let's go.

02:06.920 --> 02:09.439
Let me open that for you, all right?

02:34.908 --> 02:36.907
Hot enough for you, Larry?

02:37.307 --> 02:39.746
No, Harris, why don't you turn up the heat?

02:39.826 --> 02:42.105
Okay. I'll tell the engineer.

02:46.183 --> 02:49.582
Cheap bastards. Turn off
the air conditioning on the weekends.

03:13.812 --> 03:17.051
- Let's go to the beach.
- No.

03:17.410 --> 03:21.049
- We are going to be here our whole lives.
- Yeah, I am afraid so.

03:25.367 --> 03:27.926
- I am going to the beach!
- Give me those papers.

03:28.006 --> 03:30.405
- The papers are going to the beach.
- We aren't going.

03:30.485 --> 03:32.524
You want these?
You're coming to the beach.

03:32.604 --> 03:35.283
- I guess we are going to the beach.
- Wilson at the line.

03:36.882 --> 03:39.281
That was beautiful. Replay.

03:42.200 --> 03:43.760
Give me those papers!

03:47.238 --> 03:51.236
- You think it's safe to go in the water?
- No, better not.

03:52.236 --> 03:56.394
- You just ate. You might get cramps.
- I'll risk it.

04:05.031 --> 04:07.949
{y:i}We'll get back to you with more tunes,
{y:i}but first we'll hear...

04:08.029 --> 04:10.109
{y:i}the latest from Weather Central.

04:10.189 --> 04:13.187
{y:i}- What is happening out there, buddy?
{y:i}- Sizzle, sizzle...

04:13.267 --> 04:15.706
{y:i}as the Big Apple becomes the Baked Apple.

04:15.826 --> 04:17.545
{y:i}You better believe that these are...

04:17.625 --> 04:19.545
Oh, Christ. Will you shut that thing off?

04:19.625 --> 04:21.664
{y:i}... continues before Labor Day weekend.

04:21.704 --> 04:26.142
{y:i}It is going to be the four "H's":
{y:i}Hot, humid, hazy, and horrible.

04:28.741 --> 04:30.940
This sucks. I am so unhappy.

04:31.740 --> 04:35.578
- We should be at a real beach.
- There are no more real beaches.

04:35.618 --> 04:39.576
I mean we could go to Jones Beach
and float around in the hospital waste.

04:39.656 --> 04:41.655
Then again Coney Island is always real nice.

04:41.735 --> 04:45.134
We could go there and watch the fish
disintegrate in front of our eyes.

04:45.214 --> 04:49.372
Wait a minute. Wait a goddamn...
Hold the phone, buddy! I got it!

04:49.412 --> 04:51.851
I got the $2 million. Where are your pages?

04:51.891 --> 04:53.451
Get your pages.

04:53.491 --> 04:56.809
Oh, my God!
You are not going to believe what you see!

04:57.649 --> 04:59.448
- Okay.
- Turn to Page 28.

05:01.847 --> 05:02.887
Right after 27.

05:04.766 --> 05:06.165
- Got it.
- All right? You got it?

05:06.245 --> 05:08.364
I want you to turn to Page 41 now.

05:10.204 --> 05:11.723
- I got it.
- Check out line 18.

05:11.763 --> 05:12.803
- Okay?
- Yeah.

05:12.842 --> 05:13.962
- You see it?
- I see it.

05:14.202 --> 05:15.801
What about it?

05:16.801 --> 05:19.200
You are such a stupid piece of rat shit.

05:19.440 --> 05:20.919
Hot!

05:20.999 --> 05:23.558
- Watch your step!
- I am being barbecued here!

05:23.878 --> 05:27.516
All right. Okay. All right, buddy
I am going to explain it to you real slow.

05:27.596 --> 05:28.636
- Good.
- Okay.

05:28.716 --> 05:32.354
There's more than one check issued
on the same life insurance policy claim.

05:32.394 --> 05:36.193
One in December of '87, another in
April of '88, and two more in June.

05:36.273 --> 05:38.232
- Making any sense?
- Yeah, he died four times.

05:38.312 --> 05:40.991
Yes. According to this, he died four times.

05:41.071 --> 05:43.550
So somebody screwed up.
It wasn't us. Was it?

05:43.630 --> 05:45.589
No. It wasn't us.

05:45.669 --> 05:48.428
Don't you see?
We just uncovered a $2 million error.

05:48.508 --> 05:51.386
We're going to be heroes.
We're going up the corporate ladder.

05:51.466 --> 05:53.865
- This is good for me.
- Yes, this is good for you.

05:53.905 --> 05:57.464
- It's good for me, too.
- I'll tell Lomax first thing in the morning.

05:57.544 --> 05:59.703
- What page is it?
- No, Larry. Let me tell him.

05:59.783 --> 06:02.062
- We'll both tell him.
- Okay. Great!

06:09.579 --> 06:11.298
There is what's-her-name.

06:23.333 --> 06:24.773
Stop staring at her.

06:24.853 --> 06:26.732
You've not shut up about her
for two months.

06:26.812 --> 06:29.691
- Ask her out already, will you?
- No. I don't know what to say.

06:29.731 --> 06:31.890
She's a summer intern.
She'll be gone in a week.

06:31.930 --> 06:33.129
No, I've no idea what to say.

06:33.209 --> 06:36.368
- Say "Hi, I want to go out with you."
- I can't say that.

06:36.848 --> 06:38.127
Why not?

06:38.207 --> 06:40.006
Because there are too many people around.

06:40.086 --> 06:42.525
It's New York City.
There are always too many people.

06:42.605 --> 06:44.125
Excuse me, miss.

06:50.002 --> 06:51.402
Oh, shit.

06:52.041 --> 06:53.441
Good weekend, Bob?

06:59.078 --> 07:01.317
- You going to say something?
- Shut up.

07:02.517 --> 07:04.596
- You are blowing it.
- Shut...

07:05.556 --> 07:07.395
Please, shut up, all right?

07:14.192 --> 07:15.512
Thank you.

07:23.028 --> 07:24.108
Okay.

07:24.828 --> 07:26.387
Try witty.

07:26.787 --> 07:29.306
Say, "You know what would look
good on you?"

07:29.746 --> 07:33.024
- "Me." Huh?
- Oh, please.

07:33.184 --> 07:35.583
- Richard, that is a very good line.
- Enough, look...

07:35.663 --> 07:38.462
- if I wanted to talk to her, I'll talk to her.
- Talk to her.

07:38.502 --> 07:40.301
- Would you talk to her?
- Would you stop?

07:40.541 --> 07:42.300
- You want me to talk to her?
- Yes.

07:42.340 --> 07:43.860
Okay. Shut up.

07:44.499 --> 07:45.819
Excuse me.

07:55.415 --> 07:57.214
My aunt is very sick.

08:03.372 --> 08:04.451
What?

08:06.410 --> 08:07.650
Nothing.

08:17.366 --> 08:18.605
I don't believe this, she's...

08:18.685 --> 08:21.364
Now, don't flagellate yourself
over this, Richard.

08:21.444 --> 08:23.923
It was a very good effort.
You'll get her next time.

08:24.003 --> 08:26.762
Why did I just say that?
Larry, I don't even have an aunt.

08:26.842 --> 08:28.041
So what?

08:28.681 --> 08:30.440
Anything going on?

08:30.720 --> 08:32.200
There are these messages.

08:32.280 --> 08:35.198
And you are late for
the creative sales meeting, Mr. Lomax.

08:35.238 --> 08:37.876
- Excuse us, Mr. Lomax.
- Let me get that, sir.

08:38.397 --> 08:39.636
Sammy. Hank. How are you?

08:39.717 --> 08:41.076
Richard Parker, sir.

08:41.116 --> 08:42.835
- Larry Wilson.
- Whatever.

08:43.115 --> 08:45.274
There's nothing from a Doreena,
a Martha, Judy?

08:45.314 --> 08:47.713
- No.
- Well, that's their tough luck.

08:47.753 --> 08:49.073
- Excuse us, Mr. Lomax.
- What?

08:49.153 --> 08:51.232
There's something
we would like to show you.

08:51.312 --> 08:54.630
Wait. It's Monday morning.
After lunch, right?

08:54.750 --> 08:56.470
Quite a bit after lunch.

08:56.909 --> 08:57.909
Shoo.

09:20.580 --> 09:22.059
Yeah, I got it, François.

09:25.458 --> 09:26.537
That's $2.

09:29.096 --> 09:30.176
Rich.

09:30.256 --> 09:31.735
Look at Lomax.

09:31.855 --> 09:33.014
God.

09:33.854 --> 09:36.373
My God. Look at her.

09:36.453 --> 09:37.453
My God.

09:38.732 --> 09:40.411
Jesus. That guy.

09:40.971 --> 09:44.090
Beautiful apartment. House at the beach.

09:44.410 --> 09:47.169
Babes. A boat. A car.

09:47.528 --> 09:50.887
Do you know how much it costs
to park a car in Manhattan every month?

09:50.927 --> 09:54.765
- More than my rent.
- I mean, it's only fair.

09:54.845 --> 09:57.884
His car is a bit bigger than your apartment.

09:58.004 --> 10:00.643
So my apartment is small. It's dark.

10:00.883 --> 10:04.082
It's hot. It's in a high-crime area.
Beats living with Mom and Dad.

10:04.161 --> 10:07.480
All right. Enough.
It's just until I can afford something decent.

10:07.560 --> 10:10.119
Something without
wall-to-wall cockroaches.

10:12.558 --> 10:15.797
All I have to do is just keep
setting my goals and working hard...

10:15.837 --> 10:17.236
- I'll be fine.
- You are so naive.

10:17.476 --> 10:19.075
- I'm sorry.
- Excuse me.

10:19.835 --> 10:22.274
Go ahead. Oh, God.

10:22.354 --> 10:24.313
I hope your aunt feels better.

10:25.912 --> 10:27.072
- What?
- I said...

10:27.112 --> 10:29.391
She said, "I hope your aunt feels better."

10:29.471 --> 10:32.550
My aunt? The sick aunt. Yes, she is fine.

10:32.630 --> 10:33.909
They thought it was...

10:33.989 --> 10:36.508
Either get on the elevator or get off.

10:37.588 --> 10:38.787
I'll be back.

10:43.345 --> 10:45.624
And I lose again.

10:45.704 --> 10:48.583
I won. I have a date.

10:49.543 --> 10:50.862
- You are kidding.
- No.

10:50.942 --> 10:54.021
Gwen and I, Thursday night,
8:00 p.m., dinner.

10:54.061 --> 10:57.379
- Fabulous.
- It was the clumsy approach. It worked.

10:57.819 --> 11:00.298
You are going to want
to borrow my apartment.

11:00.378 --> 11:02.857
No, but thank you. That's sweet.

11:02.937 --> 11:05.656
But I can't do that to you. Thank you.

11:06.735 --> 11:10.174
If she finds out you live with your folks,
you will embarrass yourself.

11:10.254 --> 11:12.813
Yeah, I know, but I can't do that to you.

11:16.891 --> 11:18.970
It is the cockroaches, isn't it?

11:19.650 --> 11:22.169
- Well...
- They scatter when the lights go on.

11:24.208 --> 11:26.727
{y:i}Mr. Parker, Mr. Lomax will see you now.

11:27.007 --> 11:28.207
I feel lucky.

11:31.405 --> 11:34.684
No, I only want the Maserati
if it comes in that jet black.

11:34.684 --> 11:36.163
Look, if you can't do it for me...

11:36.243 --> 11:39.202
I'll just have to take my business
to another dealer.

11:39.682 --> 11:40.761
Yeah.

11:41.641 --> 11:44.560
So paint it! I mean how hard
can this whole thing be?

11:44.640 --> 11:45.799
Right.

11:46.839 --> 11:48.798
All right. See, that's better.

11:48.838 --> 11:51.637
See how easy it is to do business with me?

11:54.196 --> 11:56.555
No trade. Strictly cash.

11:56.795 --> 11:58.114
Right.

11:58.954 --> 12:00.313
All right. Good.

12:05.511 --> 12:07.710
Gentlemen, what have you got for me?

12:10.589 --> 12:13.308
As you may or may not know, Mr. Lomax...

12:13.388 --> 12:17.506
Larry and I have been, I mean, working.

12:17.586 --> 12:20.305
- Where is he going?
- I don't know.

12:21.384 --> 12:23.344
What are we supposed to do?

12:24.663 --> 12:27.262
Bet that thing moves, huh? Jesus.

12:27.342 --> 12:29.901
- Put that back.
- It's a beautiful boat.

12:40.337 --> 12:41.896
You gentlemen were saying...

12:41.976 --> 12:43.175
Yes, well.

12:43.255 --> 12:45.135
As you might have heard...

12:45.934 --> 12:50.053
Larry and I have been reprogramming
the accounts on the new computer system.

12:50.133 --> 12:51.732
- Right.
- Thanks.

12:53.251 --> 12:54.891
Sir, it's a very big job.

12:54.971 --> 12:57.250
A big job. We have been working hard.

12:57.330 --> 12:58.329
A very big job.

12:58.409 --> 13:00.728
I've been at it for quite some time.
Weekends also.

13:00.808 --> 13:02.887
- Weekends, late, and...
- Why don't you show him?

13:02.967 --> 13:03.967
Thank you.

13:04.007 --> 13:05.886
We've got something
you should know about.

13:05.966 --> 13:08.565
- Got them both there?
- Yes. Page 28 and 41.

13:19.960 --> 13:22.359
You sure these figures are accurate?

13:22.759 --> 13:24.158
- Yes.
- Positive.

13:24.238 --> 13:25.918
Yes, sir, Mr. Lomax.

13:28.557 --> 13:29.716
Bernie.

13:34.194 --> 13:35.714
Call me Bernie.

13:35.794 --> 13:38.073
I mean my father is Mr. Lomax, right?

13:46.989 --> 13:48.748
Okay, Bernie.

13:49.188 --> 13:53.626
- Yes, it's all there in black and white.
- We both worked on this one, Bern.

13:54.506 --> 13:55.465
"E."

13:56.105 --> 13:57.465
Bernie.

13:59.184 --> 14:01.903
- Papers.
- Right here, Bernie.

14:03.142 --> 14:05.381
If anything has to go,
I am glad it's my vision...

14:05.461 --> 14:08.540
and not the old joystick,
you know what I mean?

14:10.299 --> 14:12.338
That's computer ink, sir.

14:16.577 --> 14:18.776
Oh, no, you are wrong. Look.

14:19.255 --> 14:23.454
There are multiple checks issued
because there were several policies written.

14:23.494 --> 14:26.053
You didn't take into consideration
that it's normal...

14:26.133 --> 14:29.131
especially when using
a fluctuating COL index to combine...

14:29.211 --> 14:33.090
Iook here, a package containing
short-term and straight life policies...

14:33.130 --> 14:35.009
in an overall insurance portfolio.

14:35.089 --> 14:37.208
Now you are wasting my time.

14:42.166 --> 14:44.565
Richard worked on that part, sir.

14:45.645 --> 14:48.163
That is true, Bernie.

14:48.723 --> 14:53.001
But if you were to look at the back page,
where the policy indexes are...

14:53.081 --> 14:55.440
you'll notice that the remaining policies...

14:55.480 --> 14:59.639
are dated after
the policy holder died, Bernie.

14:59.839 --> 15:01.358
You are right.

15:01.878 --> 15:04.477
You are absolutely right.
Gentlemen, this is good work.

15:04.557 --> 15:06.236
Very, very good work.

15:06.316 --> 15:07.915
Thank you, Bernie.

15:07.955 --> 15:10.914
I hate to say this, but it appears
as if somebody is trying...

15:10.954 --> 15:13.793
to defraud the company.
Perhaps we should check back records.

15:13.873 --> 15:16.472
Somebody tried to smoke it
past the wrong guy.

15:17.191 --> 15:18.551
No smoking.

15:18.951 --> 15:21.949
Gentlemen, how long have you two
been working here?

15:22.029 --> 15:24.428
- Nineteen months and a week.
- I am not really sure.

15:24.468 --> 15:27.187
- A little longer, I think.
- Longer? I was here before you.

15:27.267 --> 15:28.547
No, Richard. I trained you.

15:28.627 --> 15:31.466
I came here in January,
you came the end of May.

15:31.545 --> 15:33.105
I trained you.

15:33.185 --> 15:34.464
Whatever!

15:35.424 --> 15:38.303
What I am saying is that
I think there is a big future here...

15:38.383 --> 15:41.101
for a couple of bright fellows
like yourselves.

15:41.781 --> 15:42.901
Thank you.

15:42.981 --> 15:45.220
But I'd like to go over these numbers
with you...

15:45.300 --> 15:47.619
just to make sure
that you've gotten everything.

15:47.699 --> 15:50.737
The only trouble is if someone is trying to...

15:51.057 --> 15:53.256
like you said
"smoke it past the wrong guy"...

15:53.336 --> 15:55.575
I'd like to just keep it confidential.

15:55.615 --> 15:58.254
I mean there is no sense sending up
a bunch of red flags.

15:58.334 --> 15:59.494
No, absolutely not.

15:59.574 --> 16:01.453
If you would like, we'll work late.

16:01.493 --> 16:04.772
- Yes, I mean we'll work weekends.
- Weekends are very good for me.

16:04.852 --> 16:07.251
Weekends. Good idea.

16:07.650 --> 16:10.449
Give us plenty of time together,
no distractions.

16:10.569 --> 16:12.169
It is Labor Day.

16:15.847 --> 16:17.326
I got an idea.

16:19.925 --> 16:23.524
How would you two like to come
to my house at the beach?

16:23.644 --> 16:24.883
- Me?
- Us?

16:24.963 --> 16:26.643
Yeah. Hampton Island.

16:26.723 --> 16:29.401
Ever been there? Well, you will love it.

16:29.481 --> 16:31.720
When we're not working,
there are distractions.

16:31.800 --> 16:34.639
There are women, swimming,
boating, famous people.

16:37.878 --> 16:39.237
Well?

16:39.277 --> 16:40.317
- Love to!
- Okay.

16:40.397 --> 16:42.196
Good! It's settled.

16:42.836 --> 16:45.795
We are going to have a good time,
I guarantee.

16:45.875 --> 16:47.874
My secretary will write down
the directions...

16:47.914 --> 16:50.193
- give you the ferry schedule.
- The ferry schedule?

16:50.273 --> 16:53.551
It's the only way to get there,
unless you have a boat. I don't know.

16:53.631 --> 16:55.391
I have never even been on a boat.

16:55.471 --> 16:57.870
I was once on the Staten Island Ferry
with my folks...

16:57.950 --> 17:01.748
Whatever. You come out Friday night,
you'll have a great time, I guarantee it.

17:01.788 --> 17:04.787
I'll even drive you back to the city myself
on Monday. Okay?

17:04.867 --> 17:06.986
We don't know what to say, Bernie.

17:07.746 --> 17:09.944
You don't have to say anything.

17:10.105 --> 17:12.943
If you two uncovered what I think
you uncovered...

17:13.262 --> 17:16.742
old Bernie here owes you both a great deal.
I mean it sincerely.

17:16.821 --> 17:19.021
Now get out of here. Go on.

17:20.980 --> 17:22.419
He loves us.

17:22.739 --> 17:26.657
The man absolutely loves us.

17:28.777 --> 17:30.256
You have to kill them, Vito.

17:41.811 --> 17:44.050
Let me explain something to you.

17:44.810 --> 17:48.569
We don't do that anymore.
We are a corporation now.

17:49.528 --> 17:51.967
We are in the market. We invest.

17:52.007 --> 17:55.806
Real estate. Car rentals. Parking lots.

17:57.165 --> 17:59.404
Parking lots. That's good.

18:00.124 --> 18:03.043
- I understand that, but...
- Didn't I order the walnut dressing?

18:03.083 --> 18:05.442
- Yes, you did.
- Taste that.

18:07.081 --> 18:10.160
Does that taste
anything like walnut dressing? Tell me.

18:10.879 --> 18:13.198
This is the raspberry vinaigrette.

18:13.998 --> 18:16.677
Should I have Paulie go
and talk to the chef?

18:19.236 --> 18:22.794
This goddamn raspberry vinaigrette...

18:26.953 --> 18:28.512
Excuse me, Vito.

18:36.948 --> 18:39.667
I know how important food is to you,
I mean...

18:40.987 --> 18:42.866
But we've got a problem here.

18:43.706 --> 18:46.225
I give problems. I don't get problems.

18:51.582 --> 18:53.941
How do you propose to handle it?

18:53.981 --> 18:57.060
Let's make it a murder-suicide job. All right?

18:57.700 --> 18:59.059
Okay, gentlemen?

18:59.459 --> 19:02.898
I'll plant some money, fake a note,
and they can take the rap and...

19:02.978 --> 19:05.776
I won't even have to change the books.

19:06.096 --> 19:07.776
What do you think?

19:11.854 --> 19:14.173
I like it. It's creative.

19:17.891 --> 19:20.650
I am a little rusty. But it'll come back to me.

19:26.728 --> 19:27.847
Okay.

19:30.526 --> 19:33.165
- Do it.
- This is good.

19:33.285 --> 19:35.844
I mean this is really good. Good.

19:37.963 --> 19:41.402
I think we are going to have some fun.

19:46.040 --> 19:49.318
- I have to get going. I really do.
- What, no dessert?

19:49.838 --> 19:52.877
They do a wonderful crème brûlée here.
It's delicious.

19:53.157 --> 19:56.715
No, gentlemen, I really must be going.
Thanks for dinner, Vito.

20:03.393 --> 20:05.552
I got to go powder my nose.

20:22.265 --> 20:24.544
Forget the accident with the two guys.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.063
Take care of Lomax.

20:27.782 --> 20:28.982
He's getting too careless...

20:30.661 --> 20:31.741
too greedy.

20:34.779 --> 20:36.139
Besides...

20:37.538 --> 20:39.498
he's screwing my girlfriend.

20:39.737 --> 20:42.576
But you said we were going to
spend the weekend at the beach!

20:42.656 --> 20:45.575
You heard the conversation.
What am I supposed to do about it?

20:45.615 --> 20:46.615
- Bernie.
- What?

20:46.695 --> 20:50.333
I told Vito I was going to spend
some time with my mother!

20:57.090 --> 20:58.929
I have to see you, Bernie.

21:00.169 --> 21:01.368
Cut it out.

21:02.008 --> 21:04.847
- What's wrong with you? Wait a minute.
- What?

21:04.927 --> 21:06.806
- I have an idea.
- What?

21:06.886 --> 21:09.885
You are on, 9:00 Friday night.
I'll be at the apartment.

21:09.965 --> 21:11.844
Just use your key. All right?

21:12.644 --> 21:14.803
I'll wear something special.

21:15.842 --> 21:18.201
I bet you never had sweet and sour
matzo balls before.

21:18.281 --> 21:19.281
No.

21:22.120 --> 21:24.999
- I am glad you finally asked me out.
- You are?

21:26.278 --> 21:28.437
I wish you had asked me out sooner.

21:28.677 --> 21:31.876
Today was my last day at work.
I am going back to college.

21:32.915 --> 21:35.154
We could still have
this weekend together, right?

21:35.234 --> 21:37.194
I am spending it with my folks.

21:37.274 --> 21:39.713
- Are your folks in town?
- No.

21:40.472 --> 21:44.071
Is this the intimate evening
I promised you, or what?

21:44.750 --> 21:47.669
You think there's anywhere we could go
to just sit and talk...

21:47.749 --> 21:50.988
and not have to scream
and get run over by garbage trucks?

21:51.068 --> 21:52.947
- Hey, want to throw her in?
- How you doing?

21:53.027 --> 21:56.186
I'd invite you to my apartment,
but I have five roommates.

21:56.266 --> 21:58.625
And they are all at home
doing their hair right now.

21:58.705 --> 22:02.703
That's a lot of hair. But it's clean. I like that.

22:03.303 --> 22:07.221
It's either that or living with my parents,
and I don't think that's a good idea.

22:07.301 --> 22:10.740
I can't blame you. Who'd want
to live with their folks? That's no good.

22:10.820 --> 22:13.858
- Do you have any roommates?
- No. Roommates? No. None.

22:14.218 --> 22:15.698
Why don't we go to your place?

22:15.778 --> 22:19.376
Come on, baby. You're not a woman.
Are you? Tell me the truth.

22:25.094 --> 22:26.373
Okay.

22:38.448 --> 22:40.327
Why are you tiptoeing?

22:41.847 --> 22:43.166
Because...

22:46.485 --> 22:50.123
the people who live downstairs,
they're very light sleepers.

22:51.363 --> 22:53.762
They get angry when I walk.

22:54.961 --> 22:56.880
Why are you whispering?

22:58.400 --> 22:59.999
- Am I?
- Yes.

23:00.599 --> 23:04.917
I am. That's because of the walls.
They are too thin.

23:05.917 --> 23:09.555
- Make yourself at home.
- Thank you.

23:22.150 --> 23:26.108
Look at this teak.
I mean this whole apartment.

23:26.628 --> 23:28.827
Sort of '60s style.

23:28.907 --> 23:31.906
Yeah. I know.
I've been meaning to redo that for years.

23:31.986 --> 23:35.065
No, I love it. I mean, it's very hip.

23:36.464 --> 23:38.743
I think you have done the place beautifully.

23:38.823 --> 23:41.062
I like it. It's home.

23:41.142 --> 23:44.061
You know, it's a side of you
I never would have expected.

23:44.101 --> 23:45.660
I'm very impressed.

23:45.740 --> 23:47.379
- Are you?
- Yeah.

23:48.499 --> 23:49.858
About what?

23:50.258 --> 23:53.057
This apartment has got to be expensive.

23:53.137 --> 23:55.896
So obviously you could have taken me
to some flash restaurant instead of that...

23:56.016 --> 23:58.535
Is "dump" the word you are groping for?

23:59.055 --> 24:01.134
You didn't like Hymie's Hunan?

24:01.734 --> 24:04.852
- It's a four-star dive.
- It was great. I loved it.

24:04.932 --> 24:08.291
It's just that some men
would try to impress women by...

24:08.371 --> 24:10.490
pretending to be something they are not.

24:10.570 --> 24:14.048
I absolutely agree. That's a terrible way
to begin a relationship.

24:14.128 --> 24:16.887
Pretending to be something you are not.

24:17.007 --> 24:18.247
Oh, God.

24:18.487 --> 24:21.445
You don't have to answer this
if you don't want to...

24:21.525 --> 24:24.204
but how do you afford a place like this?

24:26.443 --> 24:28.602
I don't like to brag.

24:28.802 --> 24:31.961
I just feel uncomfortable
showing off my money...

24:32.041 --> 24:36.199
but I've made some wise investments.
I dabble in the stock market.

24:36.439 --> 24:40.557
And of course my parents
were rather well off.

24:41.197 --> 24:42.916
Do you want to sit?

24:45.995 --> 24:47.634
They passed away?

24:48.714 --> 24:49.754
Yes.

24:49.914 --> 24:51.953
They must have been young.

24:52.752 --> 24:54.032
Oh, yeah.

24:54.312 --> 24:56.911
I feel I can trust you.

24:58.910 --> 25:01.149
They were in a train accident.

25:01.349 --> 25:03.788
Yeah, I mean I don't know
what it was with trains...

25:03.868 --> 25:07.466
but they just always liked to travel in trains.

25:08.466 --> 25:09.825
I am sorry.

25:10.865 --> 25:13.064
- How awful for you.
- Yeah.

25:14.983 --> 25:19.581
You know, I always thought trains
were so much safer than planes.

25:20.221 --> 25:23.540
Well, actually, a plane...

25:24.619 --> 25:26.418
fell on the train.

25:52.288 --> 25:53.807
- Richard.
- Gwen.

25:56.286 --> 26:00.124
There's a man in his underwear
in your kitchen.

26:01.044 --> 26:02.923
He's... He's with me.

26:05.962 --> 26:08.241
He's my butler. But...

26:08.841 --> 26:11.440
- You have a butler?
- Yeah. Don't get him started.

26:11.520 --> 26:14.838
He'll just go away if you just be quiet.

26:23.235 --> 26:25.434
Sorry. I didn't realize you had company.

26:25.514 --> 26:27.193
Good evening, young lady.

26:27.273 --> 26:29.312
That's all right, Monroe.

26:32.031 --> 26:36.589
Yes, will you, please, just go lay out
my navy blue suit for the morning?

26:36.669 --> 26:37.749
Please.

26:37.829 --> 26:40.188
- How about if I lay you out?
- Very well.

26:45.106 --> 26:48.544
- You let your butler talk to you like that?
- Well, he is a vet.

26:48.624 --> 26:50.863
He has got a steel plate in his head.

26:52.822 --> 26:55.141
Gwen, it's not what you think.

26:55.661 --> 26:57.341
Goodbye, Richard.

27:24.449 --> 27:25.489
I'll grab the bow line.

27:25.569 --> 27:28.648
- Hey, Skeet. How are you doing?
- Hey, Mr. Lomax.

27:28.728 --> 27:31.606
Here you go, my friend.
Buy yourself a girlfriend.

27:32.726 --> 27:34.485
Where have you been, Candy?

27:35.445 --> 27:38.443
- Hey, Bernie. How about a drink?
- A little bit later.

27:41.642 --> 27:44.961
- Yo, Bernie. The cocktail flag is up.
- A little bit later.

27:45.041 --> 27:47.800
Booze and women.
That is my lifestyle and I love it!

27:47.880 --> 27:49.159
And I!

28:25.744 --> 28:28.543
- George, how are you?
- Nice to see you, Mr. Lomax.

28:31.821 --> 28:34.020
What are you doing here?
I fired you last week.

28:34.100 --> 28:35.660
- I just want my $90, okay?
- Bullshit!

28:35.740 --> 28:38.099
You drank my liquor
and the toilets still don't work.

28:38.179 --> 28:40.018
I don't want to see you.

28:40.258 --> 28:41.617
Get out of here!

28:42.297 --> 28:44.656
You come back again,
I am going to call the cops!

28:44.736 --> 28:46.495
You son of a bitch.

28:49.454 --> 28:53.292
- I am sorry. I think she needs a little B-12.
- Whatever.

28:53.372 --> 28:56.211
{y:i}This is Bernie. Leave a message,
{y:i}I'll get right back to you.

28:56.291 --> 28:58.250
- Goodbye, Mr. Lomax.
- Bye.

28:58.330 --> 28:59.890
Hello?

29:00.409 --> 29:03.688
Hey, Lomax. It's Paulie.
I just got to the island.

29:04.048 --> 29:05.087
You are early.

29:05.167 --> 29:07.526
Those schmucks are not coming
until the 6:00 ferry...

29:07.606 --> 29:10.085
- and I still have to plant the note.
- Yeah.

29:10.205 --> 29:11.485
So where is your house?

29:11.525 --> 29:13.604
It's on the point, top of the dune.

29:13.684 --> 29:16.523
Look, Paulie,
don't kill them while I am around.

29:16.563 --> 29:18.682
Bernie, we are on a phone here.

29:18.762 --> 29:20.521
Right. You are right. Okay, I am sorry.

29:20.601 --> 29:23.920
The point is, I just want to be
back in New York with an alibi, okay?

29:23.960 --> 29:25.999
Yeah. Don't worry about it.

29:37.074 --> 29:38.554
Oh, God!

29:40.433 --> 29:42.032
Rich. It is leaving. Come on!

29:42.112 --> 29:44.591
I told you we should've taken
a taxi from the station.

29:44.631 --> 29:47.590
- There's another boat in a half hour.
- We'll miss the parties.

29:47.670 --> 29:49.629
We got it. Excuse me.

29:49.669 --> 29:51.988
- Sorry.
- Coming through.

29:52.068 --> 29:55.507
Don't be ridiculous! What are you doing?
We are not jumping on this boat!

29:55.587 --> 29:56.946
- Do you hear me?
- Here we go!

29:57.026 --> 30:00.065
Listen to me, Larry, we are not
jumping on this boat!

30:00.145 --> 30:02.504
- Jesus Christ! My elbow!
- Piece of cake!

30:04.903 --> 30:06.422
Thanks, pal.

30:09.141 --> 30:12.460
This ferry isn't leaving. It's docking.

30:13.779 --> 30:15.858
- Okay. We're early.
- You schmuck.

30:30.612 --> 30:33.171
- What is your name?
- What is your name?

30:33.291 --> 30:35.370
- Larry.
- Hi, Larry. I am Michelle.

30:35.730 --> 30:38.968
Come on! Lighten up there, Rich!
We are on our way!

30:39.008 --> 30:42.727
I am so depressed.
I made a fool out of myself last night.

30:42.807 --> 30:43.886
Of course you did.

30:43.966 --> 30:46.445
- I should've stayed home.
- What are you talking about?

30:46.525 --> 30:50.084
We've been summoned to the mountain top.
This is good for your career.

30:50.164 --> 30:54.082
You know, by the time this weekend is over,
I promise you won't even remember...

30:54.162 --> 30:57.201
what's-her-name's name.
I'll get you a drink. Come on.

30:57.281 --> 30:59.400
Look, I'll see you later.

30:59.480 --> 31:01.959
Goodbye, young man. Nice talking to you.

31:15.273 --> 31:17.512
That is good. This is very good.

31:23.790 --> 31:26.109
- I did not hear you come in.
- I know.

31:26.949 --> 31:28.308
I am real good at that.

31:28.348 --> 31:30.947
- I told you the guys aren't here yet, didn't I?
- You did.

31:31.027 --> 31:32.786
- Good.
- Quite a shack you have here.

31:32.866 --> 31:34.306
It's home.

31:35.585 --> 31:37.224
Can I have a cigarette?

31:39.064 --> 31:40.143
Cigarette.

31:42.422 --> 31:43.542
Sure.

31:48.220 --> 31:49.819
What was...

31:59.455 --> 32:01.494
Quite a ride, huh, Bern?

32:20.326 --> 32:22.485
Glorious day out, or what?

32:22.525 --> 32:24.005
Where's Bernie?

32:24.085 --> 32:28.323
I got it right here. It says it's the last house
on the point, top of the dune.

32:29.443 --> 32:33.001
Pardon me, Monsignor, sir, could you
tell me where the top of the dune is?

32:33.081 --> 32:36.600
- Bless you, my son.
- Thank you, Father.

32:36.919 --> 32:39.079
Look, we'll find it. Okay.

32:39.758 --> 32:42.557
- You know, it's an island, right?
- How hard can it be?

32:43.877 --> 32:45.956
Excuse me. Is this the way to...

33:01.109 --> 33:04.388
- Yo, is this Bernie Lomax's house?
- Sure is.

33:04.868 --> 33:06.027
Wow.

33:06.107 --> 33:08.866
Holy shit. Look at this.

33:10.466 --> 33:11.945
Come on, Rich.

33:14.704 --> 33:16.183
Oh, beautiful.

33:16.303 --> 33:18.462
Oh, my God. He has got a pool.

33:18.702 --> 33:21.701
He has got a goddamn pool at the beach.
It's heated.

33:21.781 --> 33:23.100
I love this man.

33:24.060 --> 33:26.779
This is inspiring. Look at this view.

33:26.939 --> 33:30.177
- I am getting laid.
- Sure beats Coney Island.

33:36.215 --> 33:38.414
What? Should we just walk in?

33:39.773 --> 33:44.012
No, we'll stand out here all weekend.
Come on, we are houseguests.

33:45.651 --> 33:48.010
Hello! Bernie, we are here.

33:48.570 --> 33:49.769
Amazing.

33:50.569 --> 33:51.888
I am home.

33:52.008 --> 33:53.328
Excellent.

33:54.207 --> 33:58.246
- Admit it. You are glad you came.
- Okay, I admit it.

33:59.085 --> 34:02.524
- We got three days of this ahead of us.
- Oh, yeah. This is something.

34:02.604 --> 34:06.922
I mean a place like this must go for what,
a $1.6 million, $1.7 million. Unfurnished.

34:07.002 --> 34:10.121
- Good God! That's a Lichtenstein!
- What? Where?

34:10.201 --> 34:12.560
Not the piano. The painting. It's an original.

34:12.639 --> 34:14.239
Of course it is.

34:14.319 --> 34:17.558
All of this could be yours,
if you set your goals and work hard.

34:17.638 --> 34:20.916
My old man worked hard.
All they did was give him more work.

34:23.715 --> 34:25.514
Hey, is Bernie around?

34:26.434 --> 34:29.833
Hello. No, haven't seen him.
But we just got here.

34:29.913 --> 34:32.391
We're going to be here all weekend.
We are houseguests.

34:32.471 --> 34:34.751
Tell him Tawny borrowed his boat
to go skiing.

34:34.831 --> 34:36.710
Hi, Tawny. I am horny.

34:36.750 --> 34:40.947
- Hi. Look, don't forget to tell Bernie, okay?
- Okay.

34:41.148 --> 34:44.746
Tawny, you wouldn't happen to know
where Bernie is, would you?

34:44.826 --> 34:46.186
He's probably making the rounds.

34:46.266 --> 34:50.184
Everybody parties from house to house,
but they always end up here. Bye!

34:50.824 --> 34:54.621
- And you didn't want to come.
- I admit it, I was wrong.

34:55.502 --> 34:57.501
Oh, my God.

34:58.461 --> 35:02.939
Nothing but champagne and caviar.
Pierre Jouët.

35:03.019 --> 35:04.778
This guy is my idol.

35:04.858 --> 35:06.657
- Don't open that.
- Why not?

35:06.737 --> 35:08.816
We are houseguests, come on.
You want some?

35:08.896 --> 35:11.895
No, thanks. This is strange.
Where's our host?

35:12.455 --> 35:15.094
You heard Tawny. He's out partying.
Come on.

35:15.174 --> 35:17.853
Let's check out the rest of this joint.

35:18.412 --> 35:19.492
This is fabulous.

35:25.090 --> 35:28.008
I found him. Mr. Lomax.

35:28.328 --> 35:30.048
Bernie! How are you doing? Great place.

35:30.128 --> 35:33.606
I hope you don't mind, but we just
walked in. We didn't know that you...

35:33.686 --> 35:34.886
Bernie?

35:35.805 --> 35:37.205
He's sleeping.

35:39.963 --> 35:41.163
Yeah.

35:43.242 --> 35:45.561
It's not even dark out
and he's out of his skull.

35:45.641 --> 35:48.120
He's been working awfully hard, you know.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.919
Don't slap him. That's your boss.

35:51.639 --> 35:54.038
I know. He's meditating.

35:54.158 --> 35:57.116
He's not. He's like dead, man.
Come on, let's walk him around.

35:57.196 --> 35:58.996
We'll get the blood circulating.

35:59.076 --> 36:01.155
There we go. Okay, this way.

36:02.554 --> 36:03.914
Here we go.

36:04.953 --> 36:07.352
That's it. Move those feet, Bernie.
That's a boy.

36:07.432 --> 36:09.551
- Here you go.
- Get him up.

36:09.791 --> 36:11.630
Carry your weight, here, Richard.

36:11.710 --> 36:12.990
Come on, Bernie.

36:13.070 --> 36:15.549
- Move those feet.
- He's giving me a hernia.

36:16.028 --> 36:19.027
I am losing him. Put him on the couch.

36:21.706 --> 36:25.145
- We can't just leave him like this, you know.
- Come on, Bernie.

36:29.823 --> 36:32.062
Get your hand off me, Bernie.

36:34.741 --> 36:36.500
I'll make the coffee.

36:43.537 --> 36:47.375
Don't you worry, Mr. Lomax, we'll make
you some coffee, fix you right up.

36:49.974 --> 36:52.453
Tell you what, let's just make you
a little more comfy.

36:52.533 --> 36:54.652
That is better. There you go.

36:55.092 --> 36:58.531
You are dropping things
right out of your pocket here.

37:05.048 --> 37:07.487
You want to come in here for a minute?

37:07.567 --> 37:10.166
- Yeah, look, Rich, is instant okay?
- That's fine.

37:10.246 --> 37:12.885
- Good. What?
- Look what I found in his pocket.

37:15.924 --> 37:17.203
Wow.

37:18.123 --> 37:19.282
Jesus.

37:19.962 --> 37:22.681
I never knew he was into the drug scene.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.799
God. Look how much is here.

37:25.879 --> 37:28.838
This is not recreational. This is a career.

37:29.238 --> 37:31.077
This man needs some help. You know that?

37:31.157 --> 37:33.396
If he's not careful,
he's going to wake up dead.

37:33.476 --> 37:36.355
I watch {y:i}20/{y:i}20. I know the statistics.

37:37.075 --> 37:38.274
I read.

37:40.313 --> 37:42.632
- What?
- Larry, Lomax is dead.

37:47.550 --> 37:49.190
He can't be.

38:01.944 --> 38:04.663
Why do these things always happen to me?

38:07.742 --> 38:11.900
What kind of a host invites you to his house
for the weekend and dies on you?

38:13.100 --> 38:16.458
Why would he do this?
I mean, he had everything.

38:16.938 --> 38:19.577
A house. Cars. Women.

38:20.657 --> 38:22.176
This is tragic.

38:22.896 --> 38:27.294
I don't understand why he couldn't wait
until Monday to kill himself.

38:28.653 --> 38:31.172
Look. We have to call the police.

38:31.372 --> 38:35.451
And how am I going to get back to the city?
He promised me a ride.

38:35.690 --> 38:39.809
Knock it off, Larry. Who cares about a ride?
We are talking death here.

38:41.608 --> 38:43.407
I mean this is just my luck.

38:43.887 --> 38:45.766
I finally catch a break at the office...

38:45.846 --> 38:48.965
finally see some light
at the end of the tunnel and wham! Gone!

38:49.045 --> 38:52.044
Wait a minute. What am I going to tell them?

38:52.164 --> 38:54.403
They might think
we had something to do with it.

38:54.483 --> 38:57.481
I told everyone we were going
to Bernie's house for the weekend.

38:57.561 --> 38:59.960
They were so jealous. I mean, I loved it.

39:00.760 --> 39:03.959
- Now what am I going to tell them?
- I don't know.

39:04.878 --> 39:06.917
Bernie, you should have been on the court.

39:07.757 --> 39:09.596
- What a great day.
- Do you see him?

39:09.676 --> 39:10.916
Where are you?

39:18.233 --> 39:22.471
Bernie, baby, get off your ass.
It's party time!

39:23.231 --> 39:25.630
You should have been out there
sailing with us today.

39:25.710 --> 39:28.748
The sun was fabulous, the wind was
fabulous, we had a great time.

39:28.828 --> 39:30.508
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

39:30.668 --> 39:34.066
Love you, darling, just love you.
You know, you could use a little sun.

39:34.106 --> 39:36.185
We are going again tomorrow
if you want to go.

39:36.265 --> 39:39.984
Lie on the deck, catch those rays.
Don't worry. I'll help myself.

39:41.903 --> 39:43.222
He's dead.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.701
That's the idea, isn't it? Cheers.

39:48.020 --> 39:49.300
Hi, Bern!

39:50.100 --> 39:51.499
Hey, Bernie.

39:54.298 --> 39:55.417
Hi, Bernie.

39:57.297 --> 39:59.536
Hey, dude. You need to pump some iron.

40:02.135 --> 40:03.814
So, Bernie. What about your Porsche?

40:03.894 --> 40:05.533
Had a chance to think about my offer?

40:05.613 --> 40:09.332
You know, $30,000 is a more than
decent price for that car.

40:10.091 --> 40:14.449
You just think about it, take your time,
don't rush into anything. See you later.

40:19.727 --> 40:20.767
Excuse me.

40:20.847 --> 40:21.966
You promised me a review...

40:22.046 --> 40:24.285
on the front page
of the {y:i}Sunday Times book section.

40:24.365 --> 40:26.085
I know, Alice, but he won't bend on it.

40:26.165 --> 40:28.484
He says there's no interest
in the subject matter.

40:28.564 --> 40:30.643
Pardon me. What's the book about?

40:30.723 --> 40:33.801
Whether Sherlock Holmes
and Dr. Watson were secretly married.

40:33.881 --> 40:35.841
- Eyes, nose, and breasts.
- How much?

40:35.881 --> 40:38.639
A little tuck here, little sand there,
a little lift there.

40:38.719 --> 40:39.999
Do I need that much?

40:40.079 --> 40:42.838
These people.
Where did all these people come from?

40:42.878 --> 40:45.277
Floating party. Happens every weekend.

40:45.397 --> 40:47.436
- Like a drink?
- No, thanks.

40:47.556 --> 40:49.875
Yeah, I'd love some champagne, thanks.

40:49.955 --> 40:52.434
Hey, Bernie. What a radical party.

40:53.193 --> 40:55.912
Got to move your workout
to late tomorrow afternoon, B.

40:55.952 --> 41:00.110
Liza's maid is over for the weekend,
and I had to give her your regular time.

41:01.150 --> 41:02.909
Thanks, Klaus. I got it.

41:03.189 --> 41:04.549
See you, Bern.

41:05.068 --> 41:07.947
Feels good, eh, Bern? You are really loose.

41:08.147 --> 41:11.186
Never seen you this relaxed before.
Keep it up.

41:11.266 --> 41:13.065
I've got to go. Duty calls.

41:14.145 --> 41:15.904
Hey, babe.

41:15.984 --> 41:19.223
Hi, Bernie. I hear you got something for me.

41:19.502 --> 41:21.142
A little present.

41:22.701 --> 41:24.620
Playing games, are we?

41:25.220 --> 41:27.779
It's got to be in here somewhere.

41:29.378 --> 41:31.497
I think I found something.

41:33.097 --> 41:34.896
Thanks a lot, Bernie.

41:36.495 --> 41:39.134
Doesn't anyone realize he's dead?

41:41.693 --> 41:43.732
Okay, Bernie, I'm going to shoot the wad.

41:43.812 --> 41:47.131
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I am going to go $40,000.

41:47.811 --> 41:49.890
No? You'll be begging me.

41:52.089 --> 41:53.848
We have to call the police.

41:55.527 --> 41:56.687
Here.

41:57.806 --> 42:00.166
- Some of the biggest producers.
- Yeah?

42:10.161 --> 42:12.480
Hello, is this the police? Yes...

42:12.560 --> 42:14.719
I got an idea.

42:14.799 --> 42:17.638
I know it's going to sound funny,
but just hear me out.

42:17.718 --> 42:20.677
No, why is the hair on the back of
my neck starting to stand up?

42:20.757 --> 42:23.276
Okay, now, we could call the police,
we could do that...

42:23.356 --> 42:25.595
but you know where we'd be
spending our weekend...

42:25.635 --> 42:30.153
in some hot police station answering
questions we don't know the answers to.

42:30.233 --> 42:33.512
Now, obviously Bernie felt
he owed us something here...

42:33.592 --> 42:36.910
some small little favor for discovering
those mistakes at the company.

42:36.990 --> 42:40.269
That's why he invited us out here
for the weekend in the first place.

42:40.349 --> 42:43.667
It'd be almost disrespectful
not to grant him his final wish.

42:43.747 --> 42:48.226
All I am saying is,
why don't we just pretend he didn't die?

42:50.984 --> 42:52.504
Just for a bit?

42:55.782 --> 42:58.141
I don't believe I am hearing this.

42:58.221 --> 43:01.460
I loved that man. He loved me.

43:01.700 --> 43:03.459
I know he loved you.

43:04.219 --> 43:05.938
He'd want this.

43:06.618 --> 43:10.896
I mean he would really want this.

43:12.815 --> 43:15.934
Yes, Operator, can you get me
the police, please? Thank you.

43:15.974 --> 43:18.613
Incidentally,
you're a disgusting human being.

43:20.372 --> 43:21.492
Gwen.

43:25.650 --> 43:28.049
- Well, hello, Gwen.
- Wayne. Hi.

43:29.328 --> 43:31.488
{y:i}Hampton Bay Police Department.

43:32.127 --> 43:33.647
{y:i}Hello?

43:34.926 --> 43:36.326
It's amazing.

43:38.285 --> 43:41.204
{y:i}- Hello. Police department.
- I'll call the police.

43:41.244 --> 43:44.722
No, you know, you were right.
Bernie would have wanted it this way.

43:44.802 --> 43:46.881
No, I think we should call the police.

43:46.961 --> 43:49.720
Larry, just give me 10 minutes, okay?

43:51.159 --> 43:52.279
Take 20.

43:53.598 --> 43:55.398
- Hi.
- Hi, Freda.

43:55.478 --> 43:56.997
Darling, you look wonderful.

43:57.357 --> 43:59.116
$45,000.

43:59.356 --> 44:02.515
Plus free tennis lessons.
That's it, take it or leave it.

44:04.314 --> 44:06.873
Is this guy a tough negotiator or what?

44:08.192 --> 44:10.112
Keep the piece of shit.

44:12.870 --> 44:14.230
What a bash.

44:18.348 --> 44:21.467
You animal. You are insatiable.

44:21.787 --> 44:23.906
You slay me, Bernie.

44:23.986 --> 44:27.824
- I've got to talk to you.
- Bernie is a little wasted right now.

44:27.904 --> 44:30.343
Hi. Wait. Okay.

44:30.423 --> 44:33.022
I can't blame you if you
never want to speak to me again.

44:33.102 --> 44:35.621
If I were you, I wouldn't want
to speak to me, either.

44:35.701 --> 44:39.979
But I just want to tell you I am sorry
for being such a jerk last night.

44:40.019 --> 44:43.578
I don't know what got into me.
I hope you can forgive me.

44:47.656 --> 44:52.094
It was kind of funny, seeing your father
in his underwear and everything.

44:53.813 --> 44:57.492
- So you do forgive me?
- No, but it was kind of funny.

44:58.092 --> 45:00.651
I'll never lie again. Honest.

45:03.929 --> 45:05.608
So what are you doing here?

45:05.688 --> 45:09.367
Mr. Lomax invited me and my friend Larry
for the weekend.

45:09.607 --> 45:12.765
- Moving up in the company?
- Yeah.

45:14.245 --> 45:17.324
I saw this great play. Yeah, it' s called...

45:17.124 --> 45:19.563
You are on your own for a minute here.

45:19.962 --> 45:22.362
Great writer.

45:24.161 --> 45:25.560
Well, hello.

45:29.199 --> 45:30.558
I'm Larry.

45:31.198 --> 45:32.757
Fuck off, Larry.

45:34.317 --> 45:35.556
Okay.

45:37.075 --> 45:39.155
By the way, how's your aunt?

45:39.354 --> 45:41.114
- Who?
- Your aunt?

45:41.833 --> 45:44.472
- She passed away.
- I'm sorry.

45:44.552 --> 45:45.752
It's all right.

45:45.832 --> 45:48.870
Didn't you say you'd be spending
this weekend with your parents?

45:48.950 --> 45:51.989
- Yes, I did. I am. They have a house here.
- Great.

45:54.468 --> 45:57.027
There's Bernie. I wanted to thank him
for my summer job.

45:57.107 --> 45:58.826
I'll be right back.

45:59.186 --> 46:00.346
No!

46:01.225 --> 46:02.345
What?

46:03.504 --> 46:04.704
Nothing.

46:10.182 --> 46:12.301
Go see Bernie about it. Go see Bernie.

46:13.380 --> 46:16.499
- Gwen, darling, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.

46:16.699 --> 46:20.657
Have I ever told you
I never liked the name Gwen on you?

46:21.097 --> 46:23.456
To me you'll always be Vanessa.

46:24.176 --> 46:27.215
Her father and I,
we went to Harvard together.

46:27.534 --> 46:30.133
You are probably right. Oh, Bernie.

46:30.333 --> 46:32.332
Here we go, sugar, move it over!
Okay, baby?

46:32.412 --> 46:33.492
Asshole!

46:33.572 --> 46:37.050
- I don't understand why we've to move him.
- Don't ask. Just move him.

46:37.130 --> 46:38.370
Here we go. Ready?

46:38.410 --> 46:42.328
- I can't believe I'm touching a dead body.
- He was your boss. Come on, let's go.

46:44.647 --> 46:47.966
- What a kidder.
- Bernie, you had a little too much.

46:48.046 --> 46:50.645
Come on, you had too much again,
you big knucklehead.

46:50.725 --> 46:52.404
Come on, let's go.

46:52.444 --> 46:54.003
Come on. He is crazy.

46:54.083 --> 46:55.883
Here we go. Walk it off, big guy.

46:55.963 --> 46:57.322
Nice outfit.

46:57.402 --> 47:01.320
Look even nicer
crumpled up on my floor in the morning.

47:03.679 --> 47:05.759
Polyester doesn't crumple.

47:08.997 --> 47:11.556
- Here we go. That's it, Bernie.
- Hi, Bernie.

47:12.316 --> 47:14.515
- Just like last week, huh?
- Come on.

47:17.474 --> 47:19.913
All right. Okay.

47:20.193 --> 47:24.151
Look me in the eye. $50,000.

47:24.231 --> 47:27.909
Yes! I knew it! Thank you, Bernie!

47:27.989 --> 47:31.108
Thank you so much. This guy is like family.

47:31.188 --> 47:32.587
You are beautiful!

47:33.187 --> 47:35.666
Grab him. Larry.

47:37.745 --> 47:39.864
- Jesus.
- Oh, God.

47:40.544 --> 47:44.023
- Hi, boys. Great view.
- Hello, there. How are you?

47:47.101 --> 47:48.781
I give it an 8.3.

47:50.500 --> 47:52.859
We can't just leave him there, you know.

48:02.695 --> 48:07.133
Girl. Beach. Sand. Surf. Moonlight.
Did you ever see {y:i}Here to Eternity?

48:10.891 --> 48:12.971
You are right. We better get him.

48:13.650 --> 48:16.889
- Thirty minutes. Then we call the cops.
- Not a second more.

48:18.728 --> 48:19.848
Ladies, how are you?

48:30.883 --> 48:31.763
Hi.

48:30.883 --> 48:31.763
Hi.

48:40.999 --> 48:43.238
Are we allowed to talk or anything?

48:47.396 --> 48:49.595
Why did you leave the party?

48:49.675 --> 48:52.954
I just don't feel comfortable
with most of those people.

48:53.034 --> 48:57.792
I don't really know any of those people.
I just know, knew, know Bernie.

48:58.432 --> 49:01.231
Besides, I figure
I can thank Bernie tomorrow.

49:01.311 --> 49:03.030
When there's more privacy.

49:04.509 --> 49:07.868
- Where are we going?
- There's a beautiful view from up there.

49:08.907 --> 49:09.947
Great.

49:18.064 --> 49:20.263
Ever been in a lighthouse before?

49:20.303 --> 49:23.181
No, this is my first time. This is great.

49:23.661 --> 49:27.780
Does anybody live up there?
A lighthouse keeper or someone?

49:27.860 --> 49:30.418
No, It's all automated now. Come on.

49:33.257 --> 49:36.256
That takes some of the romance out of it.

49:37.775 --> 49:38.935
Does it?

49:58.807 --> 50:00.366
- You all right?
- Yeah.

50:03.285 --> 50:05.684
You're right. This is beautiful.

50:07.243 --> 50:10.322
My God.
You can see the whole island from up here.

50:14.680 --> 50:16.679
I've always wondered
how these things work.

50:16.759 --> 50:18.119
Richard, don't.

50:18.878 --> 50:21.237
- I can't see.
- Watch out for the trap...

50:23.077 --> 50:24.076
door.

50:29.594 --> 50:30.833
Oh, my God.

50:38.750 --> 50:40.469
- That one works.
- Richard.

50:41.589 --> 50:43.308
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

50:43.388 --> 50:45.507
- Are you sure?
- I fell down a couple of stairs.

50:45.587 --> 50:47.426
- Anything broken?
- Nothing's broken.

50:47.506 --> 50:50.305
- Are you sure?
- A little pain, but I'm all right.

50:50.385 --> 50:52.464
- I'm fine. How are you?
- I'm good.

50:52.824 --> 50:54.344
Here. Hold on.

50:54.424 --> 50:56.543
The good news is, I can see again.

51:00.461 --> 51:03.020
- I'm so sorry, Richard.
- No, it's okay, really.

51:03.100 --> 51:04.979
I've always wanted a limp.

51:05.619 --> 51:07.658
I must thank you.
This has been a great date.

51:07.738 --> 51:09.857
I hope my major medical covers it.

51:10.377 --> 51:11.377
What?

51:12.336 --> 51:15.895
I'm sorry. I don't mean to laugh...

51:16.374 --> 51:20.013
but the look on your face
when you fell through the trapdoor.

51:20.253 --> 51:22.212
I think I've got a cracked rib.

51:22.292 --> 51:25.091
- Do you want to sit down?
- No.

51:25.171 --> 51:29.009
No, I better not. The way things are going,
I'm gonna break my ass.

51:29.409 --> 51:31.008
You'll be okay.

51:59.197 --> 52:02.115
I've had a crush on you
since the first day I saw you at work.

52:02.195 --> 52:03.635
I'm crazy about you.

52:07.073 --> 52:08.513
This is so right.

52:10.592 --> 52:13.751
Oh, my God. This can't be happening to me.

52:13.831 --> 52:17.589
It's happening to both of us.
You're right. It's so right.

52:17.669 --> 52:20.348
No. This isn't right, it's all wrong.
Not here in the sand.

52:20.428 --> 52:21.867
- What?
- You deserve more than this.

52:21.947 --> 52:24.666
You need music, flowers, candles.
You need...

52:26.265 --> 52:28.265
You need to get out of here.

52:28.345 --> 52:31.303
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm serious. You could catch a cold.

52:31.343 --> 52:33.342
- Where do you live?
- Dune Walk.

52:51.495 --> 52:52.974
Are you dead, too?

52:54.134 --> 52:55.893
Mister? Hello?

52:56.453 --> 52:58.732
Oh, Jesus. What is it with this place?

53:01.491 --> 53:03.770
How are you? Party's over.
You have to go home now.

53:03.850 --> 53:05.569
- Where's Bernie?
- He's swimming.

53:05.649 --> 53:08.368
I had a wonderful time.
I'm sorry I had to leave so early.

53:08.408 --> 53:10.967
Have fun. See you at the next one. Larry!

53:20.843 --> 53:22.562
Larry, are you in there?

53:22.682 --> 53:25.561
- Come on out, Lar. Right now.
- Go away.

53:25.641 --> 53:27.200
I need to talk to you.

53:27.680 --> 53:29.679
Can you just give me 30 seconds?

53:30.719 --> 53:32.918
Bernie is waiting for us.

53:34.797 --> 53:38.475
- Look, Bernie isn't going anywhere, okay?
- I need you, Lar.

53:48.751 --> 53:49.951
Bernie, he needs you, too.

53:50.111 --> 53:51.070
Unbelievable.

54:02.186 --> 54:05.464
How am I supposed to know
that the tide is gonna come up that high?

54:05.504 --> 54:07.463
I don't want to talk about it.

54:07.543 --> 54:10.062
I don't understand why this is becoming
all my fault.

54:11.142 --> 54:13.821
- Did you invite somebody over?
- Of course not.

54:13.901 --> 54:14.980
Somebody's here.

54:15.060 --> 54:17.819
Let's just shove him in the bedroom,
we'll say he's sleeping.

54:18.379 --> 54:20.898
Bernie, you cheat.

54:21.218 --> 54:22.457
Two-timer.

54:29.894 --> 54:31.293
Bernie, open up.

54:34.372 --> 54:35.932
Darn you, Bernie.

54:36.611 --> 54:38.171
Don't do this to me.

54:40.170 --> 54:42.809
Where the hell are you, you son of a bitch?

54:42.969 --> 54:45.608
I got you now, you two-timing bastard.

54:48.166 --> 54:51.045
Who the hell are you? Where's Bernie?

54:51.565 --> 54:53.604
We're Bernie's houseguests. Who are you?

54:53.684 --> 54:55.044
I'm his woman.

54:56.043 --> 54:59.522
And I'll kill him if he's cheating on me.
Now, where the hell is he?

54:59.602 --> 55:02.081
And don't try to cover up for him, either.

55:02.640 --> 55:04.959
- He's not here.
- Haven't seen him.

55:05.039 --> 55:06.599
I don't believe you.

55:07.798 --> 55:09.997
I'm gonna tear this place apart.

55:16.275 --> 55:18.754
- That's his woman?
- I guess so.

55:29.829 --> 55:31.588
Where the hell is he?

55:31.668 --> 55:34.347
- He's in the bedroom.
- Is that so?

55:35.867 --> 55:37.346
He better be alone.

55:39.625 --> 55:40.945
God damn it.

55:41.024 --> 55:42.544
Fun while it lasted, huh?

55:42.624 --> 55:45.783
What difference does it make,
we might as well get this over with.

55:45.822 --> 55:49.021
This is good. She discovers the body,
she calls the police.

55:49.101 --> 55:51.060
Fix me a drink, will you?

55:51.660 --> 55:53.579
I hate it when they scream.

56:18.449 --> 56:19.888
Oh, no!

56:31.963 --> 56:34.562
What gives? She has been up there, what,
10, 15 minutes?

56:34.922 --> 56:36.521
I don't get it.

57:07.109 --> 57:08.868
Got a little scotch?

57:10.907 --> 57:11.987
Sure.

57:24.302 --> 57:28.020
- Did everything go okay up there?
- Never been better.

57:33.178 --> 57:34.297
Good.

57:44.813 --> 57:48.731
How do you like that?
The guy gets laid more dead than I do alive.

57:49.811 --> 57:51.370
No, she couldn't have.

57:52.730 --> 57:54.169
He couldn't have.

57:54.849 --> 57:57.128
I get yelled at when I just lay there.

58:21.598 --> 58:26.116
Vito, I'm telling you, Lomax is alive.
She was with him for at least half an hour...

58:26.516 --> 58:29.874
- in the bedroom.
{y:i}- What were they doing in the bedroom?

58:29.954 --> 58:31.913
I'd rather not say.

58:31.953 --> 58:34.073
{y:i}What the hell happened to Paulie?

58:34.153 --> 58:37.591
Yeah, maybe Paulie
is rustier than we thought, huh?

58:39.990 --> 58:43.829
- What a night.
- Great, isn't it? It isn't over yet.

58:44.068 --> 58:47.147
It is for me. I'm dead. No offense, Bernie.

58:47.947 --> 58:49.786
I just gotta lie down for a minute.

58:49.866 --> 58:53.664
Suit yourself. Whatever you like.
I'm going on to find the next party.

58:54.144 --> 58:57.383
- Just wake me up when you get back.
- Okay, sure.

58:57.423 --> 58:59.862
- Whatever you like.
- Because I got to call the cops.

58:59.942 --> 59:03.061
- Of course you do. In the morning.
- I need a clear head.

59:03.460 --> 59:04.900
Good night, buddy.

59:05.540 --> 59:08.218
Don't forget. Wake me up.

59:14.336 --> 59:17.375
I made these a little sweeter this time.
Okay, Bernie?

59:18.254 --> 59:20.053
God, it's glorious out, huh?

59:21.613 --> 59:23.212
Here we go, my friend.

59:24.452 --> 59:25.931
This should do it.

59:28.050 --> 59:29.050
Okay.

59:29.450 --> 59:31.249
How did you deal with?

59:32.328 --> 59:35.327
Oriental? I think I own that one.

59:36.127 --> 59:37.486
With hotel.

59:38.886 --> 59:40.525
$550.

59:40.565 --> 59:42.724
Give me $600, we'll call it square.

59:42.804 --> 59:44.483
Hey, Bernie, Larry.

59:44.603 --> 59:47.162
Great party last night, Bernie.
Your best ever.

59:47.242 --> 59:49.601
Ladies. Hello. How are you today?

59:49.681 --> 59:50.721
- Great.
- Fine.

59:50.801 --> 59:54.199
- Are we doing it again today?
- Absolutely. You know we are.

59:54.239 --> 59:56.438
- Great. We'll see you later, guys.
- Bye-bye.

59:56.518 --> 59:58.797
Bye-bye, ladies. We'll see you later.

59:58.957 --> 01:00:00.637
Is this great or what?

01:00:01.916 --> 01:00:03.915
Okay, coming out. My turn.

01:00:04.235 --> 01:00:05.435
Shooter now.

01:00:06.034 --> 01:00:08.913
Yes! Free parking. $500 for me.

01:00:14.511 --> 01:00:15.630
Bastard!

01:00:21.308 --> 01:00:24.787
I own it. Okay, that is $24...

01:00:24.907 --> 01:00:27.905
I own them all. $46, my friend. Call it $50.

01:00:28.225 --> 01:00:30.784
Thank you. My turn. Here we go.

01:00:30.864 --> 01:00:32.463
Lucky seven coming out.

01:00:32.663 --> 01:00:33.663
Shit.

01:00:34.543 --> 01:00:38.701
One more you get out of jail free.
All right. Fine. Your turn. I'll roll.

01:00:38.781 --> 01:00:40.420
Here we go. Coming out.

01:00:42.419 --> 01:00:43.779
Community Chest.

01:00:45.378 --> 01:00:47.497
Second prize in a beauty contest.

01:00:47.977 --> 01:00:50.936
- What are you doing?
- Playing Monopoly. You want to play?

01:00:50.976 --> 01:00:53.055
- No.
- Here we go.

01:00:53.815 --> 01:00:55.814
- How did he get down here?
- He walked.

01:00:55.894 --> 01:00:57.253
- He walked?
- Say good morning.

01:00:58.013 --> 01:01:00.972
Oh, God. You're just a sick man, Larry.

01:01:01.611 --> 01:01:04.730
- What time is it?
- It's 11:30.

01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:06.529
11:30?

01:01:07.209 --> 01:01:09.888
You let me sleep till 11:30? I have...

01:01:11.247 --> 01:01:13.646
- When did you get a Rolex?
- Oh, this.

01:01:16.485 --> 01:01:19.244
- Good God!
- He didn't need it anymore.

01:01:19.644 --> 01:01:22.643
That's it. We're gonna go to jail.
They're gonna arrest us.

01:01:22.683 --> 01:01:26.361
- I'm calling the cops.
- I wanted to call them yesterday, my friend.

01:01:27.321 --> 01:01:29.440
He's very upset. Richard, look.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:33.718
Let me just say one thing here.
There's no reason to get pissy about this.

01:01:36.557 --> 01:01:37.676
Hello.

01:01:39.675 --> 01:01:41.595
- Richard?
- It's for you.

01:01:42.554 --> 01:01:44.394
- Gwen.
- Hi.

01:01:45.433 --> 01:01:47.272
What are you doing here?

01:01:47.672 --> 01:01:50.351
I just came by to talk to Bernie.
I didn't get a chance to last night, so...

01:01:51.431 --> 01:01:54.269
Oh, no. Bernie and I
are in a very big business meeting.

01:01:54.349 --> 01:01:55.549
- Now?
- Yes.

01:01:55.589 --> 01:01:58.588
Bernie has such little time,
so can you come back later?

01:01:58.628 --> 01:02:01.386
Wait a minute.
What happened to Mr. Romantic?

01:02:01.466 --> 01:02:05.425
- Candlelight? Flowers?
- I know. But Bernie is tied up right now.

01:02:07.824 --> 01:02:10.383
- It's a bad time.
- What is going on, Richard?

01:02:10.463 --> 01:02:12.822
Okay. I'll tell you.

01:02:12.902 --> 01:02:15.461
I probably shouldn't,
I know I shouldn't, but...

01:02:15.541 --> 01:02:18.499
at this point, why not? Mr. Lomax is...

01:02:27.136 --> 01:02:30.095
my boss. I work for him
at the insurance company.

01:02:33.253 --> 01:02:35.252
Bernie, you're starting to peel.

01:02:35.492 --> 01:02:37.651
Better get you out of the sun, huh?

01:02:39.731 --> 01:02:41.050
Here we go.

01:02:45.208 --> 01:02:47.767
We were really looking forward
to coming out here...

01:02:47.847 --> 01:02:49.766
when we got here, Mr. Lomax...

01:02:50.406 --> 01:02:51.766
Bernie was...

01:02:53.925 --> 01:02:54.924
dead.

01:02:57.323 --> 01:02:58.403
Dead.

01:02:58.603 --> 01:03:01.761
Like your mother and father were dead.
And your aunt is dead, too?

01:03:01.841 --> 01:03:02.841
Different kind of dead.

01:03:16.035 --> 01:03:18.514
You son of a bitch. I got you.

01:03:23.592 --> 01:03:27.151
Then how come I saw Bernie
with you and your friend at the party?

01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:30.110
Because...

01:03:32.469 --> 01:03:34.028
You don't believe me?

01:03:35.867 --> 01:03:38.346
Okay, I'm gonna prove it to you. Come on.

01:03:38.506 --> 01:03:39.946
This is not going to be fun.

01:03:50.141 --> 01:03:52.300
I know you think I'm crazy, but...

01:03:57.058 --> 01:03:58.058
Well?

01:03:59.617 --> 01:04:00.977
Where is Bernie?

01:04:01.497 --> 01:04:02.736
Oh, hello.

01:04:03.776 --> 01:04:05.975
- Where's Bernie?
- He went for more daiquiri mix.

01:04:06.055 --> 01:04:07.334
No, he didn't.

01:04:07.414 --> 01:04:10.213
Richard, I don't know what
this game is you're playing...

01:04:10.293 --> 01:04:12.012
but this is ridiculous.

01:04:12.092 --> 01:04:14.851
- I'm out of here.
- Gwen, I'm not playing any games with you.

01:04:14.931 --> 01:04:17.410
I'm telling you the truth! Bernie is here.

01:04:18.809 --> 01:04:20.569
Where is Bernie?

01:04:20.649 --> 01:04:23.328
What, you bastard, did you do with Bernie?

01:04:27.926 --> 01:04:29.645
I'm phoning the police.

01:04:35.962 --> 01:04:38.761
There's no dial tone. With 97 buttons...

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:43.639
{y:i}- Where is your house?
- Where is the off button?

01:04:43.719 --> 01:04:46.678
{y:i}Look, Paulie, just don't kill them
{y:i}while I'm around.

01:04:46.918 --> 01:04:49.876
{y:i}- Bernie, we're on a phone here.
{y:i}- You're right.

01:04:49.916 --> 01:04:52.435
- Play that back.
- I just got it stopped.

01:04:52.515 --> 01:04:54.115
Play it back, please.

01:04:55.234 --> 01:04:58.353
{y:i}Hey, Lomax, it's Paulie.
{y:i}I just got to the island.

01:04:58.913 --> 01:04:59.872
{y:i}You're early.

01:04:59.952 --> 01:05:02.351
{y:i}Those two schmucks
{y:i}won't come until the 6:00 ferry...

01:05:02.391 --> 01:05:05.110
{y:i}- and I still have to plant the note.
{y:i}- Yeah.

01:05:05.550 --> 01:05:08.749
{y:i}- Where is your house?
{y:i}- It's on the point, top of the dune.

01:05:09.308 --> 01:05:10.868
{y:i}Look, Paulie...

01:05:11.188 --> 01:05:14.706
{y:i}- don't kill them while I'm around.
{y:i}- Bernie, we're on the phone here.

01:05:14.786 --> 01:05:16.705
{y:i}You're right. I'm sorry.

01:05:16.785 --> 01:05:19.824
{y:i}The point is, I just want to be
{y:i}back in New York with an alibi.

01:05:19.904 --> 01:05:21.383
{y:i}Don't worry about it.

01:05:25.742 --> 01:05:27.621
We were on the 6:00 ferry.

01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:31.099
And we're two schmucks.

01:05:34.058 --> 01:05:36.217
- Kill us?
- Lomax?

01:05:36.817 --> 01:05:39.416
Bernie is gonna have us killed?

01:05:39.976 --> 01:05:41.095
Kill us?

01:05:42.415 --> 01:05:43.894
- Why?
- I don't know.

01:05:47.053 --> 01:05:50.411
Unless he's the one
whose been stealing from the company.

01:05:51.131 --> 01:05:53.890
Son of a bitch. He's gonna kill me!

01:05:54.810 --> 01:05:56.209
I liked the guy.

01:05:57.169 --> 01:05:58.248
Okay.

01:05:58.408 --> 01:06:00.847
He said something about a note, right?

01:06:00.927 --> 01:06:03.406
- I know, Richard.
- Let's find it.

01:06:21.318 --> 01:06:23.358
Bernie, you lying swine.

01:06:30.115 --> 01:06:31.794
Holy crap!

01:06:32.234 --> 01:06:33.393
What?

01:06:43.189 --> 01:06:46.268
- There's a $100,000 here easy.
- This is the note. Listen.

01:06:46.348 --> 01:06:49.867
"Richard Parker and I
stole this money from the company...

01:06:49.867 --> 01:06:52.785
- "to pay for my sex change operation."
- What?

01:06:52.865 --> 01:06:54.545
That's what it says.

01:06:54.985 --> 01:06:59.543
"Now he tells me he loves someone else.
I can't live with that, and neither will he."

01:06:59.743 --> 01:07:01.662
It's got my name on it.

01:07:03.141 --> 01:07:04.621
Oh, God.

01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:09.538
Son of a bitch. It's not bad enough
that he's trying to kill me...

01:07:09.618 --> 01:07:11.977
now he's turning me into a drag queen.

01:07:13.177 --> 01:07:15.496
Why couldn't he say
you were having the operation?

01:07:15.576 --> 01:07:17.975
- It doesn't matter.
- It does matter, Richard.

01:07:18.015 --> 01:07:21.374
- I've a reputation to protect here.
- For Christ's sakes, Larry!

01:07:21.454 --> 01:07:24.532
No one is going
to have a sex change operation.

01:07:26.811 --> 01:07:28.211
Oh, yeah!

01:07:28.251 --> 01:07:29.890
I got to call the cops.

01:07:31.729 --> 01:07:34.408
{y:i}- Operator.
- Operator, the police, please.

01:07:34.808 --> 01:07:37.967
{y:i}You mean Ed?
{y:i}He's out on the beach somewhere.

01:07:38.127 --> 01:07:41.445
When do you expect Ed back?
It's a bit of an emergency.

01:07:41.525 --> 01:07:44.404
{y:i}I don't know. Wanna leave a message?

01:07:44.484 --> 01:07:45.923
- Yeah. Help!
{y:i}- Okay.

01:07:46.003 --> 01:07:47.843
Let's get out of here.

01:07:48.322 --> 01:07:51.601
We have to get off this island,
and maybe not get killed doing it.

01:07:51.681 --> 01:07:55.439
- Wait a minute.
- Tell me you have a brilliant idea.

01:07:55.719 --> 01:07:57.838
- I have an idea.
- What is it?

01:07:57.918 --> 01:08:01.957
Lomax told whoever he was talking to
not to kill us if he's around, right?

01:08:02.037 --> 01:08:04.796
But Lomax is dead.
He isn't around anybody anymore.

01:08:04.875 --> 01:08:07.035
I know that. You know that.

01:08:08.354 --> 01:08:09.953
Nobody else knows that.

01:08:10.793 --> 01:08:11.833
Where's Bernie?

01:08:13.992 --> 01:08:15.351
Right there.

01:08:16.231 --> 01:08:17.670
There's no Bernie.

01:08:18.750 --> 01:08:20.988
He's gotta to be, Rich.
I dumped him here myself.

01:08:21.069 --> 01:08:22.228
Where is he?

01:08:23.587 --> 01:08:25.067
- Larry.
- What?

01:08:27.185 --> 01:08:28.866
- Excuse me.
- Hey, kid.

01:08:28.944 --> 01:08:30.745
- What are you doing?
- What do you want?

01:08:30.825 --> 01:08:32.464
- You little brat!
- What are you doing?

01:08:32.544 --> 01:08:34.183
Get out of there.

01:08:34.223 --> 01:08:36.662
- What the hell are you doing?
- You can't do that.

01:08:36.742 --> 01:08:38.462
This is private property.

01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:41.140
- You're talking to me?
- Yeah.

01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:43.499
- Shut up.
- Who are you... You lousy...

01:08:45.179 --> 01:08:47.778
You better be gone by the time we get there.

01:08:47.858 --> 01:08:50.895
- Scram! Get out of here!
- You little bastard.

01:08:51.296 --> 01:08:53.455
How'd you like to kiss this?

01:08:53.654 --> 01:08:55.573
- We have bigger problems.
- Kiss my ass.

01:08:55.654 --> 01:08:58.973
- What kind of home training is that?
- He buried all of Bernie.

01:08:59.053 --> 01:09:00.093
Jesus.

01:09:00.492 --> 01:09:01.452
Come on.

01:09:20.804 --> 01:09:25.322
- Good thing for you, you're dead, pal.
- I actually felt sorry for you, you rat shit.

01:09:25.362 --> 01:09:27.361
He looks good enough. Let's go.

01:09:28.001 --> 01:09:29.520
- Larry.
- What?

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:32.118
Jesus.

01:09:32.799 --> 01:09:35.198
I never knew he wore a toupee.
You can hardly tell.

01:09:35.238 --> 01:09:38.756
Who cares? What are we gonna do about it?
We can't take him out like this.

01:09:38.836 --> 01:09:41.675
The killer might not know it's Bernie
and shoot us.

01:09:45.714 --> 01:09:49.232
- So long, Lar, it has been fun but not really.
- Goodbye, Rich.

01:09:56.109 --> 01:09:58.828
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is...

01:10:00.108 --> 01:10:01.147
Jesus.

01:10:01.267 --> 01:10:03.826
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is...

01:10:10.503 --> 01:10:12.063
You little bastard.

01:10:13.902 --> 01:10:16.461
- Get back here, you little monster.
- Never mind him.

01:10:16.541 --> 01:10:18.300
I'm gonna rip your gums out!

01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:22.058
- I'm gonna get that little kid.
- What are we gonna do with Bernie?

01:10:22.778 --> 01:10:23.738
Oh, boy.

01:10:24.298 --> 01:10:27.296
Come on, Bernie. Up.

01:10:30.335 --> 01:10:32.254
Put it on him.

01:10:33.734 --> 01:10:34.973
Brilliant.

01:10:39.011 --> 01:10:41.131
- Sambuca on the rocks.
- Yes, sir.

01:10:51.046 --> 01:10:53.046
Here we go. Ready. Up.

01:10:55.285 --> 01:10:57.564
You take him down. I'll get the cart.

01:11:12.797 --> 01:11:14.277
Hey, Bernie!

01:11:16.596 --> 01:11:17.915
Bernie, wait a minute.

01:11:17.995 --> 01:11:20.514
- That guy talking to us?
- Who cares? Get out of here.

01:11:20.594 --> 01:11:22.593
Bernie, I've got to talk to you.

01:11:23.473 --> 01:11:24.912
Bernie, come on.

01:11:28.511 --> 01:11:30.510
- Hey, Bernie. Looking good.
- Hi.

01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:32.749
- Hi, Bernie.
- Hello.

01:11:34.189 --> 01:11:36.707
- Great party last night, Bern.
- How are you?

01:11:38.227 --> 01:11:40.186
Bernie, I've got to talk to you.

01:11:40.266 --> 01:11:41.865
Jesus. He's behind us.

01:11:43.105 --> 01:11:45.064
Shit! Is that the killer?

01:11:45.144 --> 01:11:47.383
How do I know, Richard?
Should I stop and ask him?

01:11:47.463 --> 01:11:49.022
No. Just drive. Just go.

01:11:49.142 --> 01:11:50.982
Bernie, I gotta talk to you.

01:11:51.341 --> 01:11:54.180
- Doesn't this thing go any faster?
- This is it.

01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:55.939
We gotta talk.

01:11:59.178 --> 01:12:00.658
What about our arrangement?

01:12:00.737 --> 01:12:02.737
Come on, Larry. Move it.

01:12:11.293 --> 01:12:14.492
Hey, Bernie. The Maserati.
I painted it black for you.

01:12:15.371 --> 01:12:16.851
The Maserati!

01:12:21.409 --> 01:12:22.768
Ferry's gonna leave.

01:12:22.848 --> 01:12:25.727
Hold it. Wait. Stop this for a second.

01:12:27.686 --> 01:12:29.006
Let's go.

01:12:29.086 --> 01:12:32.884
Rich, grab him. Grab a leg.

01:12:32.964 --> 01:12:34.843
Wait.

01:12:34.963 --> 01:12:38.242
We can't just drag him in.
He's got to look like he's alive.

01:12:39.721 --> 01:12:40.721
Idea.

01:12:50.037 --> 01:12:53.556
Your right leg on three, ready?
Here we go. One, two, three, go.

01:12:53.636 --> 01:12:54.795
Hold the boat!

01:12:54.835 --> 01:12:56.474
Got it? Hold the boat.

01:12:56.554 --> 01:12:58.673
Hold that boat.

01:13:01.152 --> 01:13:02.392
Hold it.

01:13:02.552 --> 01:13:03.871
- Hi, Bern.
- How are you doing?

01:13:03.951 --> 01:13:05.870
Hold the boat!

01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:09.389
Hold the boat, please.

01:13:09.469 --> 01:13:11.388
Hold on. We'll be right there.

01:13:13.107 --> 01:13:14.707
We're coming.

01:13:18.465 --> 01:13:19.665
Come on, Bern.

01:13:22.823 --> 01:13:24.903
Hold it. Hold the boat.

01:13:25.902 --> 01:13:28.141
Shit! What do we do?

01:13:29.261 --> 01:13:30.500
Stop the boat.

01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:34.978
Look at this fool.
He wants to get off, we want to get on.

01:13:35.058 --> 01:13:36.898
- I'm gonna kill you.
- What?

01:13:36.978 --> 01:13:39.736
You don't have to worry about
anybody else murdering you...

01:13:39.816 --> 01:13:41.815
because I'll do it. This was all your fault.

01:13:41.895 --> 01:13:44.414
- We'll die on this crummy island.
- Let me remind you...

01:13:44.494 --> 01:13:46.973
you're the one who did the extra work
on the computer.

01:13:47.053 --> 01:13:49.292
If it wasn't for me
you'd be fired six months ago.

01:13:49.372 --> 01:13:51.052
You can't even work the coffee machine.

01:13:51.132 --> 01:13:54.730
A little brownnosing, ass kissing,
to work our way up that corporate ladder.

01:13:54.810 --> 01:13:57.249
Why can't you be a lazy shit like I am?

01:13:58.329 --> 01:14:01.008
Somebody talk to the captain.

01:14:01.647 --> 01:14:03.127
I've got to get off the boat.

01:14:03.207 --> 01:14:04.806
- Let's go.
- I'm sorry.

01:14:04.886 --> 01:14:06.165
Please.

01:14:08.884 --> 01:14:10.803
Somebody talk to the captain.

01:14:12.683 --> 01:14:15.761
- I'm sorry, but we're still gonna die.
- Not if Bernie's with us.

01:14:15.841 --> 01:14:17.920
Great, I hope the killer keeps that in mind.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.359
Larry, please tell me
how we're going to get off this island.

01:14:21.399 --> 01:14:22.998
- We got a boat.
- What boat?

01:14:23.078 --> 01:14:24.438
Lomax's boat.

01:14:24.638 --> 01:14:27.157
- Tawny brought the keys back, remember?
- Right. Okay.

01:14:27.237 --> 01:14:29.396
You go and get them,
I'll stay here with Bernie.

01:14:29.476 --> 01:14:31.115
I'm not going anywhere without Bernie.

01:14:31.195 --> 01:14:33.554
You go back, get the keys.
I'll stay with Bernie.

01:14:33.634 --> 01:14:36.753
We'll all go back to the house.
We'll all get the goddamn keys.

01:14:36.833 --> 01:14:38.952
- We'll all stay with Bernie.
- Fine.

01:14:40.311 --> 01:14:41.271
Hurry up.

01:14:42.150 --> 01:14:43.830
Move it.

01:14:46.029 --> 01:14:47.348
Hold up.

01:14:47.988 --> 01:14:49.307
Okay. The keys.

01:14:49.987 --> 01:14:52.026
- Here they are.
- Got it. Let's go.

01:14:52.106 --> 01:14:53.586
Oh, my God, Richard!

01:14:55.425 --> 01:14:57.024
It's the killer.

01:14:59.063 --> 01:15:00.383
Get the door.

01:15:02.102 --> 01:15:03.262
Quiet.

01:15:04.661 --> 01:15:06.420
- Lock it.
- I can't lock it.

01:15:06.620 --> 01:15:08.340
I only have a key to the boat.

01:15:09.459 --> 01:15:10.539
Kitchen.

01:15:10.619 --> 01:15:13.817
- There's no door. Back door.
- Okay.

01:15:15.537 --> 01:15:17.296
Don't panic.

01:15:19.175 --> 01:15:20.894
Do something, Rich.

01:15:21.174 --> 01:15:23.093
I got Bernie, you get the guy.

01:15:24.733 --> 01:15:26.212
Do something, Rich.

01:15:27.052 --> 01:15:28.291
Get him, Rich.

01:15:33.129 --> 01:15:35.608
You in here, Lomax? You little bastard.

01:15:36.368 --> 01:15:37.487
You jerk.

01:15:38.167 --> 01:15:39.846
Kick me in the ass.

01:15:41.166 --> 01:15:42.685
It's my turn now.

01:15:46.444 --> 01:15:47.683
Got him, Lar.

01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:56.080
There's another one.

01:16:03.277 --> 01:16:04.596
He's got a knife.

01:16:07.235 --> 01:16:08.395
Mr. Lomax.

01:16:09.434 --> 01:16:10.674
What the hell?

01:16:16.871 --> 01:16:19.550
- You can come out now, Rambo.
- You sure, Rich?

01:16:21.269 --> 01:16:22.429
Good job.

01:16:25.308 --> 01:16:27.627
- Two killers.
- Anybody could be the killer.

01:16:27.707 --> 01:16:31.665
- Jesus, we gotta get rid of them.
- Let's shove them in the kitchen pantry.

01:16:37.942 --> 01:16:40.661
I don't know why
I have to carry the heavy guy.

01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:44.700
Get his legs.

01:16:45.579 --> 01:16:47.498
Larry, let me out.

01:16:53.256 --> 01:16:54.655
Here comes Bernie.

01:16:56.695 --> 01:16:57.734
Coming through!

01:16:59.174 --> 01:17:00.933
There it is. Stop.

01:17:03.052 --> 01:17:04.091
Hi, guys.

01:17:05.531 --> 01:17:09.729
Ready? On three, here we go.
One, two, three.

01:17:12.048 --> 01:17:13.288
Let's go.

01:17:18.485 --> 01:17:19.845
Okay. Untie us.

01:17:22.604 --> 01:17:23.603
Okay?

01:17:25.043 --> 01:17:27.522
- Give me the keys.
- Have you ever driven a boat before?

01:17:27.602 --> 01:17:29.321
I was born on a boat.

01:17:36.398 --> 01:17:37.917
This is a fancy boat.

01:17:42.755 --> 01:17:44.275
- Push something.
- I am, Richard.

01:17:44.355 --> 01:17:45.674
- Nothing's happening.
- I know.

01:17:45.754 --> 01:17:47.873
- Push something else.
- Something's happening.

01:17:47.953 --> 01:17:50.432
Something's definitely
happening here, huh?

01:17:51.832 --> 01:17:53.791
Wait a minute, hold on.

01:17:53.871 --> 01:17:55.910
Are you trying to give me a heart attack?

01:17:56.110 --> 01:17:58.669
- I know it's here.
- Just keep pressing those buttons.

01:17:59.029 --> 01:18:01.428
I'm pressing. I pressed that button.

01:18:01.588 --> 01:18:03.667
- Nothing is happening, Larry.
- I know that.

01:18:03.747 --> 01:18:06.146
- Did you try the key?
- Don't insult my intelligence.

01:18:06.186 --> 01:18:07.625
- Try the key again.
- Fine.

01:18:07.705 --> 01:18:09.104
See that?

01:18:09.224 --> 01:18:11.623
- Here we go!
- We're going home. Give it some gas now.

01:18:11.663 --> 01:18:12.903
Giving it gas.

01:18:15.022 --> 01:18:16.581
Gas.

01:18:16.661 --> 01:18:18.980
- Nothing's happening.
- More gas.

01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:20.420
A little more gas.

01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:22.339
We're not moving. Why aren't we moving?

01:18:22.419 --> 01:18:23.698
I don't know.

01:18:24.258 --> 01:18:28.416
- Larry, you said you've done this before.
- It's different than my boat, okay?

01:18:28.456 --> 01:18:30.016
Don't panic.

01:18:30.256 --> 01:18:31.775
Stop the boat, Larry.

01:18:33.055 --> 01:18:34.174
Stop!

01:18:38.692 --> 01:18:39.972
Back it up.

01:18:41.931 --> 01:18:43.210
We got it.

01:18:43.290 --> 01:18:45.090
- What's going on?
- That's illegal.

01:18:45.169 --> 01:18:48.288
- What you're doing is illegal.
- You have a nice day now.

01:18:48.568 --> 01:18:49.808
Are you nuts?

01:18:52.326 --> 01:18:55.725
- Got it now. Moving forward. Hold on.
- Oh, shit!

01:19:01.803 --> 01:19:03.642
Sorry, Rich. Coming back.

01:19:05.441 --> 01:19:06.760
Coming around.

01:19:09.399 --> 01:19:11.039
Why is this happening to me?

01:19:11.119 --> 01:19:12.278
Coming back.

01:19:17.076 --> 01:19:19.875
- Here we are.
- Stop the boat. Idiot.

01:19:20.115 --> 01:19:21.754
Stop the boat!

01:19:24.113 --> 01:19:27.032
- Where are the brakes?
- Boats don't have brakes, Captain.

01:19:27.112 --> 01:19:29.751
You're kidding. How do they stop?

01:19:29.831 --> 01:19:31.230
Throw the anchor.

01:19:31.270 --> 01:19:32.390
The anchor, throw it.

01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:34.549
- They're headed for us.
- Here we go.

01:19:34.629 --> 01:19:36.508
Whatever you're doing, don't.

01:19:38.227 --> 01:19:39.267
Sorry.

01:19:43.785 --> 01:19:45.225
You broke my watch.

01:19:45.584 --> 01:19:46.944
Mine still works.

01:19:47.024 --> 01:19:49.223
You better put that thing
back on the dead body.

01:19:49.303 --> 01:19:50.982
Drive the boat, Richard.

01:19:51.062 --> 01:19:54.061
The cops are gonna take
our fat heads to jail.

01:19:54.501 --> 01:19:57.339
My God. Look at them.

01:19:57.379 --> 01:19:59.059
Ladies, how are you?

01:19:59.459 --> 01:20:01.898
Hello, Betty.

01:20:02.058 --> 01:20:04.976
God! Just once, I'd like a woman like that.

01:20:05.296 --> 01:20:06.376
Let's party.

01:20:12.333 --> 01:20:14.093
Turn the boat.

01:20:17.491 --> 01:20:19.370
Watch the fishermen.

01:20:26.527 --> 01:20:28.726
- Watch the wake!
- Duck!

01:20:28.806 --> 01:20:30.486
Watch the wake, Richard!

01:20:40.082 --> 01:20:42.041
This is tougher than it looks.

01:20:42.161 --> 01:20:44.080
You're doing very well, Richard.

01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:46.279
- Sorry I snapped at you.
- It's okay.

01:20:46.359 --> 01:20:48.678
I've never been chased by a killer before.

01:20:48.718 --> 01:20:51.077
It's all right. You're doing very well.

01:20:52.876 --> 01:20:55.955
- Why is everybody waving at us?
- I'm popular.

01:20:56.035 --> 01:20:57.035
I see.

01:20:57.115 --> 01:20:59.074
Hey, Bernie, showing off again?

01:21:01.993 --> 01:21:04.711
Oh, God. What the hell are those things?

01:21:05.551 --> 01:21:08.310
Those are obviously channel markers.

01:21:08.790 --> 01:21:09.789
Obviously.

01:21:09.869 --> 01:21:12.788
Okay, wise ass, do you know
what side I'm supposed to pass on?

01:21:12.868 --> 01:21:15.747
That I don't know. Just stay close.
What else can happen here?

01:21:15.787 --> 01:21:17.146
I've got no idea.

01:21:17.746 --> 01:21:20.225
- Serpentine.
- Is that close enough?

01:21:21.904 --> 01:21:23.504
Do you hear something?

01:21:25.343 --> 01:21:27.022
- There it's again.
- Yeah.

01:21:27.462 --> 01:21:29.741
- I wonder what that is.
- What is that?

01:21:35.539 --> 01:21:37.218
- Man overboard.
- What?

01:21:37.298 --> 01:21:38.577
Stop the boat.

01:21:41.696 --> 01:21:43.216
He's got nice form.

01:21:47.694 --> 01:21:49.733
- I don't know.
- I'm trying to drive a boat.

01:21:49.813 --> 01:21:52.652
- You're doing well.
- Trying to get us off this island of hell.

01:21:52.692 --> 01:21:54.771
You had maybe one job to do.
Watch a dead body.

01:21:54.851 --> 01:21:57.330
- Well, let's not argue about it.
- Jesus.

01:21:58.449 --> 01:22:01.448
- You were the one who tied him up.
- Don't blame this all on me.

01:22:01.528 --> 01:22:03.567
- Oh, my God.
- What?

01:22:04.007 --> 01:22:05.726
You've lost my sunglasses.

01:22:21.839 --> 01:22:23.319
What are you doing?

01:22:24.758 --> 01:22:26.278
I haven't got a clue.

01:22:27.957 --> 01:22:29.476
I don't believe this.

01:22:29.996 --> 01:22:31.156
What?

01:22:33.155 --> 01:22:34.474
We're out of gas.

01:22:37.433 --> 01:22:39.912
Paddling in the Atlantic Ocean...

01:22:40.192 --> 01:22:42.791
- on a dead body.
- I'm getting swimmer's ear.

01:22:42.991 --> 01:22:44.990
This is now the perfect weekend.

01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:49.468
It started when I almost broke my leg
jumping on a moving ferry.

01:22:49.828 --> 01:22:53.666
I get to this beautiful beach and my host...
Sorry, he's dead.

01:22:55.745 --> 01:22:57.065
Hampton Island.

01:22:58.824 --> 01:23:01.343
Checkers. Excuse me, sir.
Is this your launch?

01:23:01.423 --> 01:23:03.662
- Come on, let's go.
- Don't rush.

01:23:06.781 --> 01:23:08.260
Come on.

01:23:08.340 --> 01:23:11.459
- Can you put a little snap in it, fellows?
- Okay, Cappy.

01:23:17.017 --> 01:23:18.776
Hold on, you damn fool.

01:23:19.056 --> 01:23:22.734
I fell down a lighthouse.
I had a corpse wash up...

01:23:22.814 --> 01:23:24.134
next to me on the shore.

01:23:24.214 --> 01:23:28.492
And then I find out that my dead boss
is not only a thief, he wants to kill me.

01:23:34.489 --> 01:23:35.809
I almost drown.

01:23:36.009 --> 01:23:38.887
The girl of my dreams
now thinks I'm a raving lunatic.

01:23:38.967 --> 01:23:40.767
You mean what's-her-name?

01:23:41.686 --> 01:23:44.205
And, now, we're going back
to the house of death.

01:23:44.285 --> 01:23:46.444
- Great weekend, huh?
- Great weekend!

01:23:47.484 --> 01:23:50.003
Just get here as fast as you can.
Thanks, Ed.

01:23:50.243 --> 01:23:51.282
Police is on the way.

01:23:51.362 --> 01:23:53.921
Can just lock ourselves in
until they get here?

01:23:54.001 --> 01:23:56.400
I hate it when he stares at me like that.

01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:57.800
Let's go.

01:24:00.478 --> 01:24:02.158
Put him in his bathroom.

01:24:05.556 --> 01:24:08.195
- Bernie's picked up a little weight.
- What do you expect?

01:24:08.275 --> 01:24:10.274
He's been soaking in the ocean
for two hours.

01:24:10.354 --> 01:24:11.714
Made a damn good float though.

01:24:16.552 --> 01:24:17.991
Are you in here?

01:24:32.385 --> 01:24:33.825
It's Gwen.

01:24:35.344 --> 01:24:36.583
Hi, Gwen.

01:24:36.623 --> 01:24:39.382
You've got to be the weirdest guy
I've ever met.

01:24:39.982 --> 01:24:42.021
You told me Bernie was dead, right?

01:24:42.101 --> 01:24:43.940
I just saw you with him.

01:24:44.020 --> 01:24:46.060
What's your explanation this time?

01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:48.179
I don't mean to be rude,
but get the hell out of here.

01:24:48.778 --> 01:24:51.017
No, I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me what is going on.

01:24:51.097 --> 01:24:52.097
Listen to me!

01:24:52.177 --> 01:24:55.456
You're in danger here,
leave unless you want to get shot.

01:24:56.455 --> 01:24:59.214
Lomax is dead,
somebody is trying to kill us.

01:24:59.294 --> 01:25:02.293
Can we stay at your house
until the cops come or what?

01:25:04.692 --> 01:25:06.211
It's just Bernie.

01:25:09.930 --> 01:25:13.048
Gwen, listen to me.

01:25:13.128 --> 01:25:16.207
We didn't do this to him.
Do we look like we could kill someone?

01:25:16.287 --> 01:25:18.526
Honey, have a drink, relax. You'll be fine.

01:25:18.566 --> 01:25:21.325
Let me rephrase that.
Do I look like I could kill someone?

01:25:21.405 --> 01:25:23.124
What is going on in there?

01:25:27.882 --> 01:25:30.761
- Which one of you bastards hit me?
- Son of a bitch.

01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:34.519
You want to get your butt kicked?

01:25:39.597 --> 01:25:40.877
I can explain.

01:25:57.350 --> 01:25:58.629
Company.

01:26:02.068 --> 01:26:04.867
I didn't see anything.
I was looking at my watch.

01:26:05.507 --> 01:26:06.666
I'm blind.

01:26:14.823 --> 01:26:16.102
It's empty.

01:26:17.182 --> 01:26:19.421
That's right. But this ain't.

01:26:23.539 --> 01:26:24.579
Run!

01:26:24.739 --> 01:26:25.938
Move it! This way!

01:26:29.177 --> 01:26:30.176
It's locked.

01:26:30.256 --> 01:26:32.655
What are you doing?
We're friends of Bernie's.

01:26:32.735 --> 01:26:34.415
I hate Bernie's friends.

01:26:40.052 --> 01:26:41.052
This way.

01:26:42.011 --> 01:26:43.491
To the bedroom.

01:26:44.730 --> 01:26:46.809
Come on, let's go. Up.

01:26:47.049 --> 01:26:49.488
You're dead meat, you little bastards.

01:26:54.206 --> 01:26:55.806
Now I'm really mad!

01:26:56.325 --> 01:26:57.685
Wait.

01:26:57.765 --> 01:27:01.243
- What?
- You take Gwen, you go hide...

01:27:01.323 --> 01:27:04.402
I'll let him chase me,
you try and call the cops, okay?

01:27:04.642 --> 01:27:06.961
Okay? That's it? No arguments?

01:27:07.881 --> 01:27:10.160
I'll get you all, one by one.

01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:12.399
There's no place to hide.

01:27:27.153 --> 01:27:28.752
I'm gonna die.

01:27:44.425 --> 01:27:46.944
You kicked me, you bastard.

01:27:49.223 --> 01:27:50.943
Shit! Out of bullets.

01:28:21.530 --> 01:28:22.929
Sit the hell down.

01:28:27.288 --> 01:28:28.607
Hang on, Lar.

01:28:30.926 --> 01:28:33.565
- Coming.
- I got him.

01:28:37.763 --> 01:28:38.923
Get off.

01:28:39.523 --> 01:28:41.242
- Hang on, Lar.
- I got him.

01:28:41.522 --> 01:28:45.200
Stand up. Fight like a man.
Come on. Put them up, you chicken.

01:28:48.799 --> 01:28:50.278
Watch this, Richard.

01:28:58.075 --> 01:28:59.594
All right, Lar.

01:29:06.671 --> 01:29:08.431
Fists of steel.

01:29:10.590 --> 01:29:12.269
Bernie, let go of me.

01:29:13.109 --> 01:29:14.868
I always liked you, Bernie.

01:29:19.306 --> 01:29:20.665
I got it, thanks.

01:29:20.825 --> 01:29:23.304
Just a little closer. Just get the two of us.

01:29:23.384 --> 01:29:25.184
Get the handshake in, okay?

01:29:25.423 --> 01:29:29.262
Wait a minute. I think I blinked. Did I blink?
I think I blinked a second there.

01:29:29.342 --> 01:29:31.501
- He blinked.
- He blinked. I saw him.

01:29:31.581 --> 01:29:33.140
Make sure he's wrapped up good.

01:29:33.220 --> 01:29:34.460
Wait a minute.

01:29:37.259 --> 01:29:39.338
I didn't kill him. He's not dead.

01:29:40.137 --> 01:29:41.657
I tried to kill him.

01:29:43.096 --> 01:29:44.775
Look at him. He's alive.

01:29:45.295 --> 01:29:47.574
- He's not dead. He's alive.
- Move it.

01:29:47.614 --> 01:29:49.573
That man is alive!

01:29:50.733 --> 01:29:51.813
Now what?

01:29:53.172 --> 01:29:54.691
Now I'm gonna take a week off.

01:29:54.771 --> 01:29:57.730
You're taking a vacation?
The man who won't take a coffee break?

01:29:57.810 --> 01:30:00.369
Gwen just invited me to stay with her.
What should I say?

01:30:00.449 --> 01:30:03.768
You're kidding me. You invited him?
You fool. That's fabulous.

01:30:03.808 --> 01:30:05.967
You deserve it, Richard.
The company owes you.

01:30:06.047 --> 01:30:08.366
Just a couple of days
until Gwen leaves for school.

01:30:08.446 --> 01:30:11.164
There's plenty of room
if you want to stay, Lar.

01:30:12.524 --> 01:30:15.962
Me? Oh, no, thanks.
I'll just tough it out here at Bernie's.

01:30:16.042 --> 01:30:19.201
I hear the party Saturday night is
better than Friday, actually.

01:30:24.439 --> 01:30:25.758
What is going on?

01:30:26.438 --> 01:30:29.597
- What's happened?
- Didn't you hear? Bernie Lomax got killed.

01:30:29.677 --> 01:30:30.996
- No.
- Yeah.

01:30:31.076 --> 01:30:33.515
- Did you go to that party last night?
- No.

01:30:33.715 --> 01:30:36.154
Lawrence, you done real good.
I'm proud of you.

01:30:36.474 --> 01:30:39.433
Yeah, I did okay, huh? Surprised myself.

01:30:40.512 --> 01:30:42.072
You did great, Rich.

01:30:50.348 --> 01:30:53.307
Hi, Bernie. See you at the party tonight.

01:30:53.867 --> 01:30:55.066
What?

01:30:56.905 --> 01:30:59.105
What did she say?

01:31:05.942 --> 01:31:08.101
Mister, can I bury you?

01:31:10.100 --> 01:31:11.140
Great!
