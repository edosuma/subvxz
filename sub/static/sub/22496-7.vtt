<b>7x07 - "Snarfer Image"</b>

00:37.538 --> 00:41.408
Robeast, dead ahead!
Better form Voltron!

00:45.662 --> 00:47.347
Hey, guys!

00:47.349 --> 00:50.550
- Mind if I get in on this action?
- Uh, this isn't really that

00:50.552 --> 00:52.519
kind of party, Pink Lion.

00:52.521 --> 00:56.189
- Aw, damn it. Pink lion!
- Okay, guys, I'm backing up!

00:56.191 --> 01:00.627
Uh, uh, uh, negative, Pink lion.

01:00.629 --> 01:03.630
Never mind that!

01:03.632 --> 01:06.699
- Eyes up here, Robeast!
- This is it! It's go ... oh, no!

01:06.701 --> 01:11.671
- I haven't even had sex ed in school yet!
- All right! We lured him in!

01:11.673 --> 01:14.441
Launching acidic plasma!

01:14.443 --> 01:18.745
We've all been there, buddy.

01:18.747 --> 01:22.048
To give you a better sense of
what being on a slave ship would

01:22.050 --> 01:25.118
have been like, everyone lie
down on the floor so I can duct

01:25.120 --> 01:27.020
tape your hands and feet together.

01:27.022 --> 01:31.324
Then, I'm going to choose five
of you to be the slave masters.

01:42.405 --> 01:44.402
Dad!

01:48.376 --> 01:51.511
Dad!

01:51.513 --> 01:53.746
- Unh!
- Dad!

01:53.748 --> 01:56.916
No, Clark. Stay back.
Aaah!

01:56.918 --> 02:01.754
- Whoa!
- Dad!

02:01.756 --> 02:06.326
Whaaaa!
Whoa!

02:06.328 --> 02:08.961
Ah, shit, a [bleep] bear?!

02:08.964 --> 02:12.232
Ow, it's got my head!
Clark, get the hell over here!

02:12.234 --> 02:15.135
No, no. Go back!
You can't ... ahhh! [bleep]

02:15.137 --> 02:18.872
Come back. Come rescue me!
This bear is deep into my skull!

02:18.874 --> 02:21.608
No, Clark. Don't listen to me.
I'm not thinking straight!

02:24.579 --> 02:26.213
This was the only way, Clark.

02:26.214 --> 02:30.416
People can't know that you
have superpowers.

02:30.418 --> 02:32.585
Aw, damn.
My bad, Clark!

02:36.090 --> 02:38.024
It's time for my check-up, Bones.

02:38.026 --> 02:39.926
- Let's make this fast.
- Sorry, Jim.

02:39.928 --> 02:41.795
Starfleet just handed me the orders.

02:41.797 --> 02:44.297
I'm to give every male crew
member a prostate exam.

02:44.299 --> 02:46.199
Fine.
Which one of these gizmos

02:46.201 --> 02:48.268
- do I... blow?
- I have to insert my finger

02:48.270 --> 02:51.204
into your rectum and
examine the prostate gland.

02:51.206 --> 02:54.007
- This... isn't fair.
- It's routine, Jim.

02:54.009 --> 02:56.476
I was talking about your
walnut-sized knuckles.

02:56.478 --> 02:59.145
- I'm going to get hollowed out.
- Are you ready, Jim?

02:59.147 --> 03:03.383
- Just go, Bones. Boldly go.
- Where no man

03:03.385 --> 03:05.418
- has gone before.
- Not while I was sober.

03:06.655 --> 03:09.155
- Don't be nervous, Spock.
- "Nervous," doctor?

03:09.157 --> 03:11.091
Vulcans are not emotional.

03:11.093 --> 03:13.159
Ah, god!
Do you trim your fingernails?!

03:13.161 --> 03:15.228
[bleep] it!

03:15.230 --> 03:18.598
Aye, mommy, if you can see me
from heaven, shut your eyes.

03:18.600 --> 03:21.101
- I'll be with you soon.
- Damn it, Scotty!

03:21.103 --> 03:23.870
It's a rectal examination, not
an execution!

03:23.872 --> 03:27.507
Aye, it is, Bones ...
a butt execution.

03:28.910 --> 03:31.277
Who's around to beam up old Scotty?

03:31.279 --> 03:34.848
- If you feel any discomfort ...
- This ain't my first rodeo, doc.

03:34.850 --> 03:36.783
Mount up.

03:36.785 --> 03:39.285
Bush league.

03:39.287 --> 03:42.365
- So, uh...
- So.

03:42.366 --> 03:46.092
<i>Captain's log. Stardate 4725.</i>

03:46.094 --> 03:48.762
<i>McCoy... touched my... butthole.</i>

03:49.063 --> 03:53.466
After "the bell jar," I cannot
seem to write another word.

03:53.468 --> 03:55.502
I, Sylvia Plath, must end it all.

03:55.504 --> 03:57.537
There, that should be hot enough.

03:59.107 --> 04:02.409
Oh, goodness, that's painful!
How do people do this?!

04:03.445 --> 04:05.620
Oh, my god. Oh, my
[bleep] god. Okay. Okay.

04:05.718 --> 04:08.281
Don't puss out. This is a
time-tested way to kill oneself.

04:08.283 --> 04:09.549
Trust the process.

04:09.988 --> 04:11.217
[bleep] this!

04:11.219 --> 04:14.587
"The bell jar 2: A good bell to jar hard."

04:14.589 --> 04:16.289
Writing sure is a lot easier

04:16.291 --> 04:19.492
when the alternative is sticking
your head in the [bleep] oven.

04:19.494 --> 04:21.761
I really don't think this is
going to work, your grace.

04:21.762 --> 04:27.534
Well, he [bleep] the queen,
so hang that giraffe!

04:27.536 --> 04:29.603
<i>Category 5 Kaiju approaching.</i>

04:29.604 --> 04:31.671
<i>All pilots report to jeagers now!</i>

04:31.673 --> 04:35.475
First, we drift our memories together.
Then we fight. Got it?

04:35.477 --> 04:37.210
- Not really.
- Let's just gloss over this part

04:37.212 --> 04:39.112
and hope the monster fights
are cool, all right?

04:39.114 --> 04:41.981
Let's do it.

04:41.983 --> 04:45.485
This is incredible. Your whole life,
laid out in front of me.

04:45.487 --> 04:47.187
<i>You stupid [bleep] dog!
I hate you!</i>

04:47.189 --> 04:49.222
Oh, my god!
You abuse your dog?!

04:49.224 --> 04:51.424
H-he ate my TV Guide!
Now focus!

04:51.426 --> 04:53.927
<i>Ooooh, yeah.</i>

04:53.929 --> 04:56.329
It's okay, Dave.
E-everyone does it.

04:56.331 --> 04:58.832
<i>But cows in top hats are a
St. Olaf tradition!</i>

04:58.834 --> 05:02.235
<i>Rose, you're so stupid!</i>

05:02.237 --> 05:05.105
- "Golden Girls"?!
- The drift goes deep, rookie.

05:05.107 --> 05:09.309
- Wait, is this one of my memories?
- Uhhhhhh...

05:09.311 --> 05:11.344
Oh, you're sick!

05:11.346 --> 05:14.013
- I've always loved you!
- Go eat a toilet sandwich, freak!

05:19.855 --> 05:23.590
My queen, you ...
You son of a bitch!

05:25.961 --> 05:28.328
The escaped animal is a polar bear

05:28.330 --> 05:31.498
with the ability to survive
in the Arctic and Antarctic.

05:31.500 --> 05:34.734
It exhibits massive mood swings
like that of a manic-depressive

05:34.736 --> 05:37.670
and has equal sexual desires
for both males and females.

05:37.672 --> 05:40.273
Dear god, are you suggesting
what I think you're suggesting?

05:40.275 --> 05:43.405
That's right.
A bi-polar, bipolar,

05:43.495 --> 05:47.747
- bi polar bear.
- That is very stupid.

05:49.751 --> 05:52.785
Time travel has not been
invented yet...

05:52.787 --> 05:56.623
...but in 30 years, it will be.

05:56.625 --> 06:00.527
<i>In the future, TV networks don't
awwow cartoons to have guns,</i>

06:00.529 --> 06:04.464
<i>so if they want to kill someone,
they send them back here to me.</i>

06:04.466 --> 06:09.504
<i>My name is Elmer Fudd,
and I'm a Wooper.</i>

06:11.506 --> 06:16.242
<i>The only wule is never let your
target escape, even</i>

06:16.244 --> 06:20.980
- if your target... is you.
- What are you waiting for?

06:20.982 --> 06:22.582
- Shoot me!
- What?!

06:22.584 --> 06:25.752
In the future, they don't let
me have a gun!

06:25.754 --> 06:28.688
That was my one
dimension as a character!

06:28.690 --> 06:32.036
Know what I did yesterday?
I slept for 15 hours

06:32.064 --> 06:36.129
and then beat it to a
Weader's Digest! Help me!

06:36.131 --> 06:39.299
- I can't.
- Come on. Give it to me.

06:39.301 --> 06:42.457
Pleeeease.

06:43.779 --> 06:45.772
I'll have what he's having.

06:45.774 --> 06:48.141
Blee... blee... blee...

06:48.143 --> 06:50.296
That's all, folks!

06:50.589 --> 06:53.112
Can I listen to this tape in
teddy ruxpin, mommy?

06:53.114 --> 06:54.881
Of course, Jessie.

06:54.883 --> 06:56.649
<i>Do I wish I could just leave my wife?</i>

06:56.651 --> 06:58.451
<i>Yes.
If she'd take Jessie with her</i>

06:58.453 --> 07:00.097
<i>and get out of my life,
that would be ideal.</i>

07:00.210 --> 07:02.883
<i>I just don't see that happening.
Sometimes I just think</i>

07:02.976 --> 07:06.547
<i>- murder is the only option.
- Honey, I'm missing the tape</i>

07:06.663 --> 07:09.220
from my therapy session.
Oh, shit.

07:09.464 --> 07:11.531
My wife, Melissa, and
I have decided to adopt.

07:11.533 --> 07:15.101
That's wonderful. Why don't I
bring out the first child? Annie?

07:15.103 --> 07:19.439
I'm little orphan Annie!
Leapin' lizards, I sure am cute!

07:19.441 --> 07:22.208
- How adorable.
- And this is

07:22.210 --> 07:26.045
- Pippi Longstocking!
- I'm Pippi Longstocking!

07:26.047 --> 07:29.616
- Gee whiz, I sure am cute!
- You sure are, Pippi!

07:29.618 --> 07:32.433
Let's do our dance for them!

07:37.775 --> 07:40.977
Pippi Longstocking is one of
Annie's multiple personalities.

07:40.979 --> 07:44.147
She's had a hard-knock life.
You know, uh... sex slavery.

07:44.149 --> 07:47.417
Are all her personalities
plucky singing orphans?

07:47.419 --> 07:50.553
- She's not that creative.
- My daddy's a pirate!

07:50.555 --> 07:52.122
Sure, he is.
He's not.

07:52.124 --> 07:54.157
Hello. I'm Harry Potter.

07:54.159 --> 07:56.826
This poor dear's parents were
killed in front of him, and his

07:56.828 --> 07:59.262
aunt and uncle kept him in a
cupboard until child services came.

07:59.264 --> 08:01.721
Uh, you should
know he has night terrors.

08:01.722 --> 08:04.701
- A lot of kids have nightmares.
- Well, I'm a wizard, so my

08:04.703 --> 08:07.237
night terrors manifest
themselves into actual creatures

08:07.239 --> 08:09.239
that try to claw me
to death in my sleep.

08:09.241 --> 08:11.307
- Ha.
- What else is on the table?

08:11.309 --> 08:13.743
I'm Oliver Twist!
# Food is great #

08:13.745 --> 08:15.612
* another helping would be swell *

08:15.614 --> 08:17.547
- # I'm poor #
- Go to bed, Annie.

08:17.549 --> 08:19.682
- Where is the love?
- Are you my mommy?!

08:19.684 --> 08:22.986
Oh, say hello to Bruce Wayne.
His parents were killed

08:22.988 --> 08:25.021
- in front of him, too.
- My favorite story is

08:25.023 --> 08:28.725
"Goodnight moon."
Remember to do the voices.

08:28.927 --> 08:32.294
Yes, He-Man is nigh
unbeatable now, but what if we

08:32.297 --> 08:36.299
use this spell to travel back in
time and kill his mother

08:36.301 --> 08:39.669
before he is born?!

08:39.671 --> 08:41.770
- Well?
- I've stopped pretending my

08:41.773 --> 08:43.373
opinion is taken into consideration.

08:43.375 --> 08:45.675
Yeah, well, you're right.
We're traveling back in time

08:45.677 --> 08:48.044
to kill He-Man's mother and ...
beep beep beep beep ba-boop boop.

08:48.046 --> 08:51.888
This just in ... I don't give a shit
what you think about it.

08:52.593 --> 08:55.628
Want to get some hot wings?

08:58.373 --> 09:02.892
Ha ha! The perfect plan!
Aaah!

09:02.894 --> 09:05.028
Is that a berry blue jelly belly?

09:05.030 --> 09:07.197
Oh, no, man, no!
That's my dick!

09:07.199 --> 09:10.233
My body's gone back in time, as well!

09:10.235 --> 09:12.402
Beast Man?
Beast Man?

09:12.404 --> 09:15.972
They call these hot?
I-I should have ordered the atomic!

09:15.974 --> 09:20.376
- We ordered the mild.
- [bleep] you we ordered the mild!

09:20.378 --> 09:23.013
Can I drink your blue cheese?!

09:23.014 --> 09:25.648
Ah, what did I do to deserve this?!

09:25.650 --> 09:30.887
- How am I going to kill He-Man's mom now?!
- Is that a baby alone in the street?

09:30.889 --> 09:36.059
Wait, perhaps I can use my
diminutive stature to my advantage.

09:36.061 --> 09:39.662
- Waaah! Waaah! Waaah!
- Dear god!

09:39.664 --> 09:41.965
A wild dog bit this baby's face off!

09:41.967 --> 09:45.135
- I'm a widdle baby!
- It's still alive in defiance

09:45.137 --> 09:47.804
of nature itself!
Kill it! Kill it!

09:47.806 --> 09:50.573
No one stomps a baby in
King Randor's kingdom!

09:50.575 --> 09:52.709
- Whoa!
- Wuv me.

09:52.711 --> 09:56.012
Sorry, everyone. Carry on.
Ah, they're gone.

09:56.014 --> 09:58.748
What luck!
He-Man's father will take me

09:58.750 --> 10:03.126
to his wife! I'll smother her
in her sleep and be a hero...

10:03.127 --> 10:06.818
to myself, not to society
or god, natch.

10:06.915 --> 10:10.827
Whoops, sorry, little buddy.
Got to make a quick detour.

10:10.829 --> 10:13.530
And, uh, what say we keep
this a secret from

10:13.532 --> 10:17.600
- old Mrs. Randor?
- So, King Randor has a piece

10:17.602 --> 10:19.335
on the side.
Well, that's cool.

10:19.337 --> 10:21.671
You know, I get it.
But what if this woman is

10:21.673 --> 10:24.807
He-Man's mother?
No, this won't do at all!

10:27.495 --> 10:31.814
Now, let's get a look at this harpy!
Mom?!

10:31.816 --> 10:37.987
That means King Randor was my
father, which means... Noooo!

10:37.989 --> 10:43.877
<i>Avenge me, Beast Man!
Avenge me!</i>

10:44.312 --> 10:45.461
- Wet nap?
- Wet nap?!

10:45.463 --> 10:47.030
I'm gonna have to shave this out!

10:47.032 --> 10:49.806
- Oh, first time eating buffalo wings?
- What if it is?
