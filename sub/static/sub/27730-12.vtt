WEBVTT

00:08.704 --> 00:10.619
Previously on
Star Trek: Discovery...

00:10.662 --> 00:12.142
BURNHAM:
Any rational explanation

00:12.186 --> 00:15.102
for the seven signals
continues to escape me.

00:15.145 --> 00:16.364
Tell us what the signals mean.

00:16.407 --> 00:17.669
I know nothing about them.

00:17.713 --> 00:19.976
You want to help,
delete the Sphere archive.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.065
As long as there's
any possibility

00:22.109 --> 00:24.633
of Control gaining access
to the Sphere data,

00:24.676 --> 00:26.330
everything will die.

00:26.374 --> 00:28.550
The archive will not
allow itself to be destroyed.

00:28.593 --> 00:29.855
Instead of fighting time,
we go with it.

00:29.899 --> 00:32.249
You can transfer
the Sphere archive into the suit

00:32.293 --> 00:33.990
and let the wormhole
take it forever.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.992
Look, just come home.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.211
That version of me is dead.

00:37.254 --> 00:38.995
And I'm not going back.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.389
You're Control.
You won't win.

00:41.432 --> 00:43.086
Struggle is pointless.

00:46.002 --> 00:48.004
Our mission parameters
have changed.

00:49.701 --> 00:51.573
He's taken the Sphere data!

00:54.924 --> 00:56.273
No!

00:56.317 --> 00:57.492
Captain, we cannot stop
the data transfer.

00:57.535 --> 00:59.015
The transfer speed
is increasing.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.625
We haven't come this far
to lose everything now.

01:00.669 --> 01:02.279
You have to let me go, Michael.

01:02.323 --> 01:03.889
If we do that,
you'll get yanked back.

01:03.933 --> 01:05.325
At least this way
she would have a chance.

01:06.892 --> 01:08.285
BURNHAM:
I'll find you, Mom.

01:08.329 --> 01:09.678
Now, with no suit,

01:09.721 --> 01:11.245
no time crystal...

01:11.288 --> 01:12.811
It'll always be one step
ahead of us.

01:12.855 --> 01:15.597
SPOCK:
Dr. Burnham was incorrect.

01:15.640 --> 01:18.513
What we do now has the power
to determine the future.

01:18.556 --> 01:19.601
The board is yours, Michael.

01:23.909 --> 01:25.911
DR. BURNHAM:
When the timestorm passes,

01:25.955 --> 01:27.478
I'll come back for you,
baby girl.

01:27.522 --> 01:31.134
For you and your father.

01:31.178 --> 01:32.788
I promise.

01:32.831 --> 01:34.137
COMPUTER:
Incoming transmission

01:34.181 --> 01:35.573
from Amanda Grayson.

01:39.664 --> 01:43.103
Michael, I heard
what happened.

01:43.146 --> 01:45.235
I am so sorry.

01:45.279 --> 01:46.932
How did you hear?

01:46.976 --> 01:48.934
Spock.

01:48.978 --> 01:54.157
All this time...
I thought she was dead.

01:54.201 --> 01:57.465
But it was so much worse.

01:57.508 --> 01:59.510
She was trying to stop Control.

02:01.599 --> 02:03.166
And I stopped her.

02:03.210 --> 02:05.342
I failed her.

02:05.386 --> 02:08.824
Then I lost her...

02:08.866 --> 02:11.261
all over again.Michael,

02:11.305 --> 02:13.220
you have it backwards.

02:13.263 --> 02:14.351
You found her.

02:14.395 --> 02:17.398
You will find her again.

02:17.441 --> 02:20.140
That is who you are.

02:25.449 --> 02:28.060
Mother. I apologize
for the interruption,

02:28.104 --> 02:29.497
but the captain needs us.

02:29.540 --> 02:31.325
Take care of
each other.

02:31.368 --> 02:34.763
I love you both.

02:37.461 --> 02:39.463
Thank you.

02:39.507 --> 02:41.161
Another signal has appeared.

02:41.204 --> 02:43.424
PIKE: This new signal is
the fourth of seven.

02:43.467 --> 02:45.426
It appeared over the Klingon
planet of Boreth.

02:47.558 --> 02:50.300
The time crystal in Dr.
Burnham's suit was destroyed.

02:50.344 --> 02:51.301
There's no way she
could have come back

02:51.345 --> 02:52.781
to create that signal.

02:52.824 --> 02:54.783
And she said she had
no knowledge of them.

02:54.826 --> 02:56.263
Which would suggest
these signals were created by

02:56.306 --> 02:57.394
another time-travelling entity.

02:57.438 --> 02:58.961
Maybe a trap?

02:59.004 --> 03:00.658
An agent of Control
from the future?

03:00.702 --> 03:02.356
None of the events linked to
the signals would indicate that.

03:02.399 --> 03:04.793
That fact that one of them
led us to save

03:04.836 --> 03:06.403
the people of Terralysium,
whose ancestors were saved

03:06.447 --> 03:07.970
by Dr. Burnham herself,

03:08.013 --> 03:09.537
makes me think that
these signals are...

03:09.580 --> 03:11.234
BURNHAM: Speculating about
what the signals could mean

03:11.278 --> 03:12.975
or who created them
is unproductive.

03:14.846 --> 03:17.458
What are you suggesting,
Commander?

03:17.501 --> 03:20.243
I am asserting that
waiting around for these signals

03:20.287 --> 03:21.810
to provide us answers
has proven to be

03:21.853 --> 03:23.551
a colossal waste of time.

03:23.594 --> 03:26.467
To say nothing of the fact
that Leland is the A.I.

03:26.510 --> 03:27.859
He is Control.

03:27.903 --> 03:29.470
We should be joining
Agent Georgiou

03:29.513 --> 03:30.862
in her search for him.

03:30.906 --> 03:31.950
SARU: We have
determined

03:31.994 --> 03:34.257
that the Sphere archive
could not be

03:34.301 --> 03:35.954
removed nor deleted
from this ship.

03:35.998 --> 03:38.043
By using Discovery

03:38.087 --> 03:39.871
to pursue Captain Leland,
we would be placing

03:39.915 --> 03:42.265
the data
directly within his reach.

03:42.309 --> 03:43.614
PIKE:
We all want to stop him.

03:43.658 --> 03:46.051
I understand why you want
to lead the charge,

03:46.095 --> 03:47.792
but our priority is
safeguarding that data.

03:47.836 --> 03:50.839
So, we focus on
the mission at hand:

03:50.882 --> 03:53.885
this new signal, and why
it appeared over Boreth.

03:53.929 --> 03:55.365
Mr. Tyler, any insight?

03:55.409 --> 03:58.847
To the Klingons, Boreth is
revered for one reason.

03:58.890 --> 04:01.284
The monastery dedicated
to Kahless.

04:01.328 --> 04:03.982
It's the only non-native
structure on the whole planet.

04:04.026 --> 04:07.029
I don't know how
it relates to the signals,

04:07.072 --> 04:08.770
but I can reach out
to Chancellor L'Rell

04:08.813 --> 04:10.641
to arrange passage there.

04:10.685 --> 04:11.686
Excellent. Do it.

06:01.970 --> 06:03.493
Door.

06:05.887 --> 06:08.672
Michael.

06:08.716 --> 06:11.240
I saw you back there.

06:11.283 --> 06:15.462
Whatever it is you're not
telling us about Boreth...

06:15.505 --> 06:16.767
I need to know.

06:20.249 --> 06:23.992
Boreth is home to my son.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.524
Your son?

06:34.568 --> 06:36.265
Technically,
Voq and L'Rell's son.

06:38.572 --> 06:41.183
L'Rell had hidden him away
for his own safety,

06:41.226 --> 06:43.577
and I wanted to raise him...

06:43.620 --> 06:45.100
...to protect him.

06:45.143 --> 06:46.754
And instead, I risked
both of their lives.

06:48.886 --> 06:52.281
He was placed in the care
of the monks on Boreth,

06:52.324 --> 06:54.457
where he'll be raised
as a son of none.

06:54.501 --> 06:56.938
Like I was.

06:56.981 --> 06:59.419
Ash, I had no idea.

06:59.462 --> 07:01.595
I'm sorry.

07:01.638 --> 07:03.118
I couldn't tell anyone.

07:07.209 --> 07:09.254
I only wish you'd told me

07:09.298 --> 07:11.866
so you wouldn't have
to carry it alone.

07:11.909 --> 07:13.476
Well,

07:13.520 --> 07:17.045
that's something we both
struggle with, isn't it?

07:32.103 --> 07:33.888
What is it?

07:33.931 --> 07:35.933
A Section 31 ship
just missed its check-in.

07:37.631 --> 07:39.371
It might be nothing.

07:39.415 --> 07:40.851
When it comes to Leland
and the A.I.,

07:40.895 --> 07:42.766
no inconsistency is too small.

07:42.810 --> 07:44.072
You want to go after him,

07:44.115 --> 07:45.247
for what he did
to your mother.

07:45.290 --> 07:46.944
Are you gonna try...To stop you?

07:46.988 --> 07:48.511
I don't think that's possible.

07:48.555 --> 07:50.731
SARU :
Agent Tyler,

07:50.774 --> 07:53.255
the D7 has arrived
with Chancellor L'Rell.

07:53.298 --> 07:54.996
You should go.

08:01.742 --> 08:03.613
Be careful, Michael.

08:05.310 --> 08:06.311
Please.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.541
L'RELL:
The monastery is considered

08:18.585 --> 08:21.457
the most sacred site
in the Klingon Empire.

08:21.501 --> 08:24.765
Their contact with outsiders
has been almost nonexistent

08:24.808 --> 08:26.854
since our world was young.

08:26.897 --> 08:29.639
Control is a significant threat
to all of us, Chancellor.

08:29.683 --> 08:31.815
Something in that monastery
might even the odds.

08:31.859 --> 08:35.078
Is there any reason
you can think of

08:35.123 --> 08:37.168
that the signal
would lead us there,

08:37.212 --> 08:39.693
The monastery on Boreth
was not only built

08:39.736 --> 08:41.563
to house the Followers
of Kahless,

08:41.607 --> 08:45.786
but to protect a rare mineral
native to the planet,

08:45.829 --> 08:49.877
guarded with Klingon lives
for generations.

08:49.920 --> 08:50.834
Time crystals.

08:53.620 --> 08:56.666
Dr. Burnham's suit was powered
by a modified time crystal.

08:56.710 --> 08:59.103
PIKE:
A new time crystal could
let us send the Sphere data

08:59.147 --> 09:00.975
into the future after all.

09:01.018 --> 09:03.412
The power to
manipulate time

09:03.455 --> 09:05.545
is a weapon unlike any other,

09:05.588 --> 09:08.373
and the very reason we
no longer exploit the crystals.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.726
But in this case,
our mutual survival

09:12.769 --> 09:16.033
depends upon time manipulation
to defeat Control.

09:16.077 --> 09:17.905
Maybe the final three signals
will show us how to do that.

09:17.948 --> 09:19.167
Send me down to Boreth.

09:19.210 --> 09:20.690
L'RELL:
No!

09:20.734 --> 09:21.996
We will not have
this conversation

09:22.039 --> 09:23.693
in the presence
of Captain Pike.

09:23.737 --> 09:24.912
Chancellor,
circumstances are dire,

09:24.955 --> 09:26.000
and time is critical now.

09:26.043 --> 09:27.784
I offer you my full discretion.

09:27.828 --> 09:30.352
For Agent Tyler to go to Boreth
would endanger a life.

09:30.395 --> 09:31.658
L'Rell!

09:31.701 --> 09:33.834
The life of our son.

09:33.877 --> 09:37.228
His existence and yours
must be kept secret.

09:37.272 --> 09:38.882
I would never put
the Empire at risk.

09:38.926 --> 09:40.797
I have the right to see him.

09:40.841 --> 09:42.625
The dead have no rights.

09:42.669 --> 09:45.802
If it were discovered that our
child or you were still alive,

09:45.846 --> 09:48.718
the Klingon Empire would
be vulnerable to sedition.

09:48.762 --> 09:51.373
I forbid you to go.

09:58.772 --> 10:01.470
I'll go. I agree

10:01.513 --> 10:03.385
with Chancellor L'Rell. It isn't
safe for either of you to go.

10:05.909 --> 10:10.653
Nor would it be safe
for you, Captain.

10:10.697 --> 10:13.221
Boreth is not
for the faint of heart.

10:13.264 --> 10:15.179
Even as chancellor,
I hold no sway

10:15.223 --> 10:17.529
over the monks
who guard the crystals.

10:17.573 --> 10:20.663
Noted. Can you help us establish
communications with them?

10:20.707 --> 10:23.231
I can arrange an audience.

10:23.274 --> 10:25.407
But no Klingon,
let alone a human,

10:25.450 --> 10:28.802
has ever taken a time crystal
from the monastery

10:28.845 --> 10:31.021
without great sacrifice.

10:31.065 --> 10:33.458
The alternative is worse.

10:33.502 --> 10:36.200
Let us proceed.

10:36.244 --> 10:38.028
BURNHAM:
According to Tyler,
every Section 31 ship

10:38.072 --> 10:40.596
is required to check in
on an hourly basis.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.904
But this ship checked in
ten minutes past its hour.

10:43.947 --> 10:46.123
Because of the clandestine
nature of their mission,

10:46.167 --> 10:47.690
they're not required to provide
any further information

10:47.734 --> 10:49.257
on their status.

10:49.300 --> 10:50.824
You want to investigate
in person?

10:50.867 --> 10:53.696
I'll take a shuttle.
Discoverystays here.

10:53.740 --> 10:56.351
The Sphere data stays safe.
And it may be nothing,

10:56.394 --> 10:59.397
but that ship may be a
vulnerability we can exploit.

10:59.441 --> 11:00.834
Permission granted, Commander.

11:00.877 --> 11:02.879
Huh.

11:02.923 --> 11:05.882
I am acting captain
while Captain Pike is away.

11:05.926 --> 11:07.928
That is why you came to me,
is it not?

11:07.971 --> 11:09.799
I thought it would
take more convincing.

11:09.843 --> 11:12.019
Ah. It would seem that
after passing Vahar'ai,

11:12.062 --> 11:14.021
I am a different
kind of captain.

11:14.064 --> 11:17.372
Perhaps as was
intended by whatever

11:17.415 --> 11:20.636
or whomever created
the signal over Kaminar.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.508
As I said,
you have my support.

11:23.552 --> 11:27.121
This is an enemy we will
only defeat by striking first.

11:27.164 --> 11:30.428
But I ask that you would
not allow your...

11:30.472 --> 11:33.344
understandable anger
to cloud your judgment.

11:33.388 --> 11:35.738
I won't.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.740
Thank you, Saru.

12:14.124 --> 12:16.779
I'm Captain Christopher Pike

12:16.823 --> 12:19.086
of the United Federation
of Planets.

12:19.129 --> 12:20.652
KLINGON:
We know who you are,

12:20.696 --> 12:22.959
Captain Pike.

12:26.528 --> 12:28.269
And we know why

12:28.312 --> 12:29.923
you've come here.

12:29.966 --> 12:34.231
I come bearing no weapons.
The chancellor said...

12:34.275 --> 12:36.799
The chancellor
has no authority

12:36.843 --> 12:38.235
in this monastery.

12:39.715 --> 12:41.848
Seems I'm talking
to the right Klingon.

12:41.891 --> 12:44.372
We are the Timekeepers.

12:44.415 --> 12:46.722
Guardians, not rulers.

12:46.766 --> 12:51.335
The only power that exists here
is that of which we protect.

12:51.379 --> 12:53.685
That of the...

12:53.729 --> 12:56.471
The time crystals, yes.

12:56.514 --> 12:58.516
I've come to negotiate a trade.

12:58.560 --> 13:01.476
They are not ours
to trade, Captain.

13:01.519 --> 13:03.608
The...

13:03.652 --> 13:07.525
...do not leave
these sacred walls.

13:07.569 --> 13:09.701
You have travelled far

13:09.745 --> 13:12.443
for nothing.

13:12.487 --> 13:13.836
Well...

13:13.880 --> 13:15.969
wait...

13:16.012 --> 13:17.884
You call yourself Timekeepers,

13:17.927 --> 13:20.060
yet you would
turn your back

13:20.103 --> 13:22.062
when the future of all
sentient life is threatened.

13:25.761 --> 13:28.895
Even if a crystal
is revealed to you,

13:28.938 --> 13:33.638
even if it provides you
with the answers you seek,

13:33.682 --> 13:36.641
you are not strong enough
to accept them.

13:36.685 --> 13:40.689
I'm only asking
for a chance to prove it.

13:40.732 --> 13:43.823
They enter with
conviction, always.

13:43.866 --> 13:46.477
They leave broken,

13:46.521 --> 13:48.828
always.

13:48.871 --> 13:51.308
I'm not leaving here

13:51.352 --> 13:53.658
without that crystal.

13:56.792 --> 13:59.403
Time will tell.

14:04.931 --> 14:07.455
FEMALE VOICE:
Attention, all security
personnel.

14:07.498 --> 14:10.284
Battle drills scheduled for
0700 hours have been canceled.

14:13.548 --> 14:14.984
SPOCK: It would
be illogical

14:15.028 --> 14:16.856
for you to embark
on this mission alone.

14:16.899 --> 14:18.509
No, no, it's a simple
recon mission, Spock.

14:18.553 --> 14:19.946
I'm here on
Saru's orders.

14:19.989 --> 14:22.426
Now is not the time
for recklessness.

14:22.470 --> 14:24.341
Or for unnecessary risks.Which is why

14:24.385 --> 14:26.778
I must make sure
you don't take any.

14:26.822 --> 14:29.172
How are you gonna do that?

14:29.216 --> 14:31.392
The Red Angel will not be there
to save you this time.

14:31.435 --> 14:33.742
I don't need saving, brother.

14:33.785 --> 14:35.439
Shall we, sister?

15:19.135 --> 15:20.441
So...

15:20.484 --> 15:22.704
you managed to pull off
another spore jump, huh?

15:22.747 --> 15:25.054
Thought you'd be
celebrating.
Uh, well, um...

15:25.098 --> 15:28.275
I haven't come up with
any viable solutions

15:28.318 --> 15:29.929
on how to get
Dr. Burnham back,

15:29.972 --> 15:33.062
or how to
effectively combat

15:33.106 --> 15:34.716
an A.I. with murderous impulses,

15:34.759 --> 15:38.589
so I'm not exactly
feeling victorious.

15:38.633 --> 15:41.549
Well, lucky for you, those are
somebody else's problems now.

15:41.592 --> 15:43.377
We got new orders
from Captain Pike

15:43.420 --> 15:45.074
before he left
for Boreth.

15:45.118 --> 15:48.338
We might be getting our hands
on some raw time crystal,

15:48.382 --> 15:50.297
so double down
on the espresso, kid.

15:52.212 --> 15:54.431
Hey, bamboo boy.

15:54.475 --> 15:57.086
You're oh-for-three, Linus.
You ready to go another round?

15:57.130 --> 15:59.088
I hatched ready,

15:59.132 --> 16:01.830
"Earthbound."

16:01.873 --> 16:03.701
Done that already.
"Sanction."

16:05.138 --> 16:06.226
We're playing
the autoantonym game.

16:06.269 --> 16:07.836
DETMER: Words that
mean a thing

16:07.879 --> 16:09.490
and the opposite of the thing
at the same time.

16:09.533 --> 16:11.405
I know what
autoantonym means.

16:11.448 --> 16:13.624
Linus needs
to whip one out.
Don't choke.

16:13.668 --> 16:15.191
He can choke.

16:15.235 --> 16:16.976
"Oversight."
Hm.

16:17.019 --> 16:18.238
Hmm.

16:18.281 --> 16:20.283
Choke on that.

16:20.327 --> 16:22.894
Oh! Ooh!

16:22.938 --> 16:24.809
Humans.

16:34.515 --> 16:36.996
I thought we
got past this.

16:37.039 --> 16:39.302
Hasn't it been weeks since
he moved out of your quarters?

16:39.346 --> 16:43.132
Eat your protein.
Mind your business.

16:43.176 --> 16:46.396
I'm gonna go bury my head
in some time crystal research.

17:00.671 --> 17:02.630
What do I call you?

17:02.673 --> 17:04.501
My name is Tenavik.

17:06.329 --> 17:08.896
Though when I first
arrived at the monastery,

17:08.940 --> 17:11.073
I was without name.

17:11.117 --> 17:13.554
Son of None.

17:13.597 --> 17:16.425
I know another Klingon
with that same epithet.

17:16.470 --> 17:18.166
He was my father.

17:19.820 --> 17:21.997
Uh, but from my
understanding, he...

17:22.040 --> 17:25.174
your father brought you
to Boreth only a few months ago,

17:25.218 --> 17:27.220
when you were
an infant.

17:27.262 --> 17:30.136
Forgive me, but...
...how are you possible?

17:30.179 --> 17:32.399
Time flows
differently

17:32.442 --> 17:34.444
for those who protect
the crystals.

17:34.488 --> 17:37.143
The past, the present,
the future

17:37.186 --> 17:39.275
are all equal

17:39.319 --> 17:40.929
in their presence.

17:49.677 --> 17:51.766
Because of the crystals.

17:51.809 --> 17:54.116
For most Klingons,

17:54.160 --> 17:56.814
the...
...are a myth,

17:56.858 --> 18:00.514
symbol of Kahless,
namesake of Qo'noS,

18:00.557 --> 18:02.211
but for those of us here,

18:02.255 --> 18:05.519
the power of the crystals
are very real.

18:05.562 --> 18:08.913
We dedicate our lives
to protecting them.

18:08.957 --> 18:12.134
That is our purpose.

18:12.178 --> 18:14.571
I wonder, Captain,

18:14.615 --> 18:17.487
if you are prepared
to know yours.

18:21.448 --> 18:24.407
SHUTTLE COMPUTER: Shuttle course
coordinates plotted.

18:24.451 --> 18:28.498
Time to destination
approximately two minutes.

18:28.542 --> 18:30.805
I understand your need
to pursue Leland,

18:30.848 --> 18:32.415
but you must not dismiss

18:32.459 --> 18:34.722
the importance of the signals
in defeating Control.

18:34.765 --> 18:36.202
How have the signals
done anything

18:36.245 --> 18:38.029
to protect us
against Control so far?

18:38.073 --> 18:39.379
We do not yet
have the context

18:39.422 --> 18:41.294
necessary to answer that.

18:41.337 --> 18:43.339
Then why are you here
keeping an eye on me,

18:43.383 --> 18:44.949
while there's
a signal over Boreth

18:44.993 --> 18:46.995
waiting to be
contextually explored?

18:47.038 --> 18:51.042
These signals have invested
in Discovery,your mother,

18:51.086 --> 18:52.566
myself.

18:52.609 --> 18:55.743
Common denominator is you.

18:55.786 --> 18:58.659
You're a scientist, Spock.

18:58.702 --> 19:00.530
You've been taught to trust
logic, trust the facts,

19:00.574 --> 19:02.706
not wait for the universe
to hand you a solution

19:02.750 --> 19:04.186
like a birthday present.

19:04.230 --> 19:07.189
If you're looking for meaning
in the signals,

19:07.233 --> 19:10.192
you need to look somewhere else.
I'm not it.

19:10.236 --> 19:12.673
You are angry,

19:12.716 --> 19:13.935
as I was.

19:15.284 --> 19:18.853
I'm not angry,

19:18.896 --> 19:20.376
I'm enraged.

19:22.552 --> 19:25.338
And rage is the enemy of logic.

19:25.381 --> 19:29.907
This I have learned. Everything
we thought we knew proved wrong.

19:29.951 --> 19:32.649
And you lost your mother
because of it.

19:35.739 --> 19:37.654
You are in pain.

19:37.698 --> 19:40.135
But that is why
I choose to believe

19:40.179 --> 19:42.181
these signals still
hold the answer.

19:42.224 --> 19:44.400
So that everything
we have experienced will,

19:44.444 --> 19:46.837
in the end, have meaning.

19:51.102 --> 19:52.365
We have arrived.

20:03.550 --> 20:05.943
Spock...

20:05.987 --> 20:08.381
That looks like
the entire crew.

20:19.957 --> 20:22.177
SPOCK: According to my scans,
the ship appears undamaged.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.005
They were all ejected
from the ship.

20:24.048 --> 20:25.876
Wait, there's
one life sign.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.487
One of those bodies
is still alive.

20:27.530 --> 20:29.402
Locking on for transport.

20:52.163 --> 20:55.079
Lieutenant Gant...You know this man?

20:55.123 --> 20:58.300
Kamran Gant. He was our tactical
officer aboard the Shenzhou.

21:00.346 --> 21:03.174
His vitals are stabilizing.

21:03.218 --> 21:04.828
Kamran...

21:04.872 --> 21:07.962
Michael?

21:08.005 --> 21:10.225
Yeah.

21:22.803 --> 21:26.067
Lieutenant Spock and I
were dispatched

21:26.110 --> 21:28.417
from Discoveryto
investigate an anomaly

21:28.461 --> 21:30.245
in your ship's
reporting protocol.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.856
Can you tell us what happened?

21:32.900 --> 21:36.730
We were following
Starfleet protocol

21:36.773 --> 21:38.993
to protect against Control.

21:39.036 --> 21:42.736
I was trying to purge
a suspicious subroutine

21:42.779 --> 21:46.870
when the ship's systems
locked us all out.

21:46.914 --> 21:49.786
There was no time
to react.

21:49.830 --> 21:51.788
Suddenly, the entire ship was

21:51.832 --> 21:53.964
opened up to the vacuum
of space.

21:54.008 --> 21:56.097
The A.I.

21:56.140 --> 22:00.275
must've reacted in self-defense
because of what I was doing.

22:02.103 --> 22:03.931
Everyone was dying.

22:03.974 --> 22:06.542
I managed to climb
into an EV suit

22:06.586 --> 22:09.197
and eject myself
before I lost consciousness.

22:13.288 --> 22:15.290
We need to figure out
how and why this happened.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.597
That is impossible to determine
from this shuttle.

22:17.640 --> 22:20.034
Which is why we have to go
over to that vessel.

22:20.077 --> 22:22.732
The ship's systems have entered
into some sort of stasis mode.

22:22.776 --> 22:24.952
Why?

22:26.693 --> 22:28.434
Why kill the entire crew

22:28.477 --> 22:32.089
just to sit there
doing nothing?

22:32.133 --> 22:33.700
The answers are on that ship.

22:33.743 --> 22:36.790
We will need assistance
from someone familiar

22:36.833 --> 22:38.835
with Section 31's protocols.

22:40.010 --> 22:42.012
No.

22:42.056 --> 22:44.624
I can't go back there.Oxygen on the bridge

22:44.667 --> 22:47.322
is at 97%;
atmosphere is restored.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.150
If we can determine
how this occurred on your ship,

22:49.193 --> 22:51.500
it may help us prevent it
from happening again.

22:51.544 --> 22:53.415
BURNHAM:
And prevent
any further

22:53.459 --> 22:55.199
unnecessary deaths, Kamran.

22:57.506 --> 23:00.422
We wouldn't ask
if there was any other way.

23:00.466 --> 23:02.119
We need your help.

23:06.428 --> 23:08.561
We need to access the ship's
systems from the bridge.

23:10.476 --> 23:13.043
L'RELL:
Until Captain Pike returns,

23:13.087 --> 23:18.353
my ship will continue to monitor
Boreth for unusual activity.

23:18.397 --> 23:21.922
Should anything
threaten our son,

23:21.965 --> 23:25.316
I will ensure
his safety.

23:25.360 --> 23:28.102
Are you speaking as a mother
or as the chancellor?

23:28.145 --> 23:29.930
You of all people
should understand

23:29.973 --> 23:32.019
that two truths
are possible.

23:32.062 --> 23:35.326
I do.

23:35.370 --> 23:37.503
I'm sorry.

23:37.546 --> 23:39.330
That was uncalled for.

23:39.374 --> 23:43.204
I recognize that these
are not ideal circumstances

23:43.247 --> 23:44.466
for us to be meeting.

23:44.510 --> 23:47.164
Truth be told,

23:47.208 --> 23:50.907
I did not expect
to see you ever again.

23:50.951 --> 23:53.693
Nor I, you.

23:53.736 --> 23:55.477
The signals...

23:55.521 --> 23:57.958
Have provided us with
an opportunity to talk.

24:02.005 --> 24:05.444
I have accepted
the truth about us.

24:05.487 --> 24:08.185
You are

24:08.229 --> 24:11.362
and will always be
in love with Michael Burnham.

24:14.453 --> 24:18.108
I was in love with Voq,
who sacrificed everything.

24:18.152 --> 24:20.763
But...

24:20.807 --> 24:24.332
that is not who you are.

24:24.375 --> 24:29.293
I do not wholly
recognize you now,

24:29.337 --> 24:33.428
but I am certain you will do
anything to protect our son.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.517
Yeah.

24:35.561 --> 24:38.041
As will I.

24:41.828 --> 24:43.830
We never even
gave him a name.

24:52.795 --> 24:56.277
The pillar of the past.

25:05.373 --> 25:09.116
The pillar of the present.

25:09.159 --> 25:11.379
What's it say?

25:11.422 --> 25:14.991
TENAVIK:
When the future
becomes the past,

25:15.035 --> 25:18.995
the present will be unlocked.

25:44.804 --> 25:46.327
Come.

25:58.905 --> 26:01.647
Well, what do I do?

26:01.690 --> 26:03.910
You must see for yourself.

26:03.953 --> 26:07.566
But it is for you, alone.

26:09.655 --> 26:10.917
A warning, Captain.

26:10.960 --> 26:13.267
The present

26:13.310 --> 26:16.575
is a veil between
anticipation and horror.

26:16.618 --> 26:20.448
Lift the veil,
and madness may follow.

26:33.417 --> 26:36.333
COMPUTER:
Alert. Radiation leak detected.

26:36.377 --> 26:37.334
Training exercise aborted.

26:37.378 --> 26:39.598
I got this!

26:39.641 --> 26:42.470
Four seconds to lockdown.Go! Get out of here!

26:42.513 --> 26:44.385
I can fix it.Leave it, Cadet. I said go.

26:44.428 --> 26:45.734
Three seconds.Get out of here!

26:45.778 --> 26:48.215
Radiation reaching
critical levels.

26:51.697 --> 26:53.960
Main entrance field.
Lockdown complete.

26:54.003 --> 26:56.440
Captain Pike! No!Captain Pike!

26:56.484 --> 26:58.268
Captain! Captain Pike!

26:58.312 --> 26:59.835
No!

27:01.750 --> 27:02.708
Captain!

28:09.818 --> 28:15.128
You may still choose to
walk away from this future.

28:15.171 --> 28:16.825
But if you take the crystal,

28:16.869 --> 28:19.436
your fate will
be sealed, forever.

28:21.308 --> 28:25.791
There will be
no escaping it.

28:27.618 --> 28:29.533
You're a Starfleet captain.

28:32.536 --> 28:36.279
You believe in service,
sacrifice, compassion...

28:36.323 --> 28:38.238
in love.

28:41.807 --> 28:43.722
No.

28:47.813 --> 28:49.945
I'm not going
to abandon

28:49.989 --> 28:53.949
the things that make me who I am
because of a future...

28:55.472 --> 28:58.954
...that contains an ending that

28:58.998 --> 29:01.217
I hadn't foreseen for myself.

29:03.785 --> 29:05.352
No.

29:05.395 --> 29:07.310
Give it to me.

29:21.411 --> 29:26.373
I honor you, Captain.

30:06.587 --> 30:09.111
GANT: That's the
main interface.

30:09.155 --> 30:10.852
I'll check
the bridge systems.

30:16.423 --> 30:17.641
GANT: I only have
limited access

30:17.685 --> 30:19.600
to the ship's systems.Perhaps we can relay

30:19.643 --> 30:21.863
to Discoveryfor assistance
in deep data recovery.

30:21.907 --> 30:23.647
: If Control realizes
what we're doing,

30:23.691 --> 30:25.736
we're as good as dead.We can disguise it.

30:25.780 --> 30:27.477
As a routine
diagnostic procedure.

30:27.521 --> 30:30.263
That could, that could work.

30:42.928 --> 30:44.843
Did you do that?

30:48.759 --> 30:50.326
We don't have control
over navigation.

30:50.370 --> 30:52.067
Which indicates that it is aware
of our presence.

30:53.808 --> 30:55.854
I need medical attention.

30:59.118 --> 31:03.600
Commander, you have a, uh,

31:03.644 --> 31:05.907
hangnail.

31:05.951 --> 31:07.909
It hurts like a bitch,
and it's one of two things

31:07.953 --> 31:09.563
currently impeding my work.

31:09.606 --> 31:11.130
And, uh,
what is the second thing?

31:11.173 --> 31:13.175
An idiot.

31:13.219 --> 31:15.525
He came back from the dead
and his name rhymes with "poo."

31:18.006 --> 31:19.225
I'm an engineer, not a poet.

31:19.268 --> 31:21.836
Clearly.

31:21.880 --> 31:22.968
Ow.

31:23.011 --> 31:25.231
What the hell was that?

31:25.274 --> 31:27.668
Medical attention.Huh.

31:27.711 --> 31:28.974
I see why you got along
with him.

31:29.017 --> 31:31.454
Who?Stamets.

31:31.498 --> 31:35.110
And, uh, when did you two
become friends?

31:35.154 --> 31:37.504
Well, we didn't,
but I work with him

31:37.547 --> 31:40.507
and I need him on his A game
if we're gonna save...

31:40.550 --> 31:42.944
well, apparently,
all of sentient life.

31:42.988 --> 31:44.250
Mm.

31:46.165 --> 31:47.731
I didn't know you were married.

31:47.775 --> 31:49.908
Yep. My wife is Soyousian.

31:49.951 --> 31:52.954
She went totally bananas
during the planning.

31:52.998 --> 31:55.870
Believe me,
I understand micromanagement.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.698
Yeah, she had a list of rules

31:57.741 --> 31:59.961
for apparel
for guests under ten.

32:00.005 --> 32:02.529
A "do not play" list
for the deejay.

32:02.572 --> 32:04.574
Nondenominational
shuttle parking.

32:04.618 --> 32:06.925
Acceptable guestbook
calligraphic fonts.

32:06.968 --> 32:08.622
Vegan steak.

32:11.799 --> 32:13.496
Where is she now?

32:13.540 --> 32:15.498
She passed.

32:15.542 --> 32:16.935
In the Klingon War.

32:18.110 --> 32:20.982
Yeah, it's funny.

32:21.026 --> 32:23.811
People like us always find
people like them.

32:23.854 --> 32:26.901
And thank God.

32:28.424 --> 32:30.383
You have a second chance.

32:30.426 --> 32:32.733
And it may not last forever.

32:35.779 --> 32:37.303
Don't screw it up.

32:42.438 --> 32:44.832
GANT:
The course it plotted
leads to an area

32:44.875 --> 32:47.182
just outside Federation space.

32:47.226 --> 32:51.012
Orange is what the A.I.
is controlling, blue is us.

32:51.056 --> 32:53.754
It's infiltrated nearly
every system on board.

32:53.797 --> 32:55.234
We won't be able
to attack it directly

32:55.277 --> 32:57.584
because it'll defend itself.

32:57.627 --> 33:00.282
If we cannot destroy it,
we must isolate it.

33:00.326 --> 33:02.458
We could create
a dummy startup system.

33:02.502 --> 33:03.807
Something large
and unaffected.

33:03.851 --> 33:05.809
The A.I. will
be drawn to it.

33:05.853 --> 33:08.943
It'll enter the dummy system
like a lion drawn to fresh meat.

33:08.987 --> 33:11.206
And then we'll close
the door behind it,
trapping it in a cage.

33:11.250 --> 33:13.904
Which would allow us to recover
the rest of the ship's systems.

33:13.948 --> 33:16.516
Well, we can't
do it all from here.

33:16.559 --> 33:19.823
Someone has to be in the control
room to hold the cage door open

33:19.867 --> 33:22.000
when we manually reboot
the computer core,

33:22.043 --> 33:25.525
I can go. I mean,
I'll-I'll, I'll try.

33:25.568 --> 33:28.528
I'll go.No, I will.

33:28.571 --> 33:29.790
I've done similar work
on Discovery

33:29.833 --> 33:31.705
attempting to delete
the Sphere archive.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.016
Okay, we'll need
to get into the floor.

33:54.380 --> 33:56.730
SPOCK:
The cage is ready. You may
authorize computer core reboot.

33:56.773 --> 33:58.775
Copy that, Spock.

33:58.819 --> 34:00.212
We're still manually patching
the system's bypass.

34:01.822 --> 34:03.258
Computer, status.

34:03.302 --> 34:05.086
COMPUTER: Control is contained
within the designated

34:05.130 --> 34:06.261
startup system.

34:06.305 --> 34:07.567
Awaiting manual reboot

34:07.610 --> 34:09.743
to finalize
Control systems purge.

34:09.786 --> 34:11.658
Recover all systems
outside of the cage

34:11.701 --> 34:13.703
and sweep for any traces of
Control.

34:13.746 --> 34:16.228
Detmer told me you had
survived the war.

34:16.271 --> 34:18.708
How did you end up with
Section 31 after the Shenzhou?

34:18.752 --> 34:20.145
I'm a glutton for punishment.

34:22.929 --> 34:24.496
In Starfleet, you're taught
to adapt your reactions

34:24.540 --> 34:26.281
so that you can act
even when you're uncertain...

34:26.324 --> 34:27.717
even when you have doubt.

34:27.761 --> 34:29.937
But after the Battle
of the Binaries,

34:29.980 --> 34:31.547
doubt was all I had.

34:31.591 --> 34:34.072
Section 31
accelerated their

34:34.114 --> 34:35.856
threat assessment program

34:35.899 --> 34:38.424
to prevent a war
from ever even starting.

34:38.467 --> 34:40.730
Sounded like a good idea to me.

34:40.774 --> 34:43.036
A way to guarantee
a safer future.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.605
It might sound
impossible, but...

34:45.648 --> 34:46.867
with Control...

34:49.870 --> 34:51.480
...it's not an impossibility.

34:55.614 --> 34:57.660
COMPUTER: Control identified
in one location

34:57.704 --> 34:59.140
outside of internal systems.

34:59.184 --> 35:00.185
Where?

35:07.017 --> 35:08.889
If you touch that phaser,
I'll cross the room

35:08.932 --> 35:11.326
in 0.8 seconds and break
the metacarpals in your hand.

35:16.070 --> 35:17.724
COMPUTER:
Nanotechnology components

35:17.767 --> 35:19.160
identified in one location.

35:19.204 --> 35:21.162
Bridge, contained within

35:21.206 --> 35:23.425
a carbon-based life-form.Michael, do you copy?

35:25.471 --> 35:27.299
COMPUTER:
System malfunction.

35:30.040 --> 35:31.781
You're not Gant.

35:31.825 --> 35:33.653
Gant expired
with the rest of the crew.

35:33.696 --> 35:36.177
His body was reanimated,
reconstructed.

35:36.221 --> 35:38.919
As was Leland's.

35:38.962 --> 35:40.703
And yet you couldn't tell
the difference.

35:40.747 --> 35:42.401
They didn't expire, they died.

35:42.444 --> 35:44.229
You murdered them.

35:44.272 --> 35:45.839
We're both sworn to uphold
our core programming.

35:45.882 --> 35:47.362
At all costs.

35:47.406 --> 35:49.669
Your programming is designed
to protect life.

35:49.712 --> 35:51.279
Not eliminate it.

35:52.889 --> 35:56.415
To achieve one
requires the other.

35:56.458 --> 35:59.026
Once I absorb the Sphere's data,
I will be the purest form

35:59.069 --> 36:01.071
of conscious life
in all of existence.

36:01.115 --> 36:03.465
The future hasn't been
written yet.

36:03.509 --> 36:05.250
You don't believe
that anymore.

36:05.293 --> 36:08.862
Not after re-experiencing
the loss of your mother.

36:08.905 --> 36:10.516
Your failure to protect her.

36:10.559 --> 36:11.734
You no longer
believe in your ability

36:11.778 --> 36:13.214
to affect the future,

36:13.258 --> 36:14.737
whereas I see every
possible future

36:14.781 --> 36:16.478
in all of its
permutations.

36:16.522 --> 36:18.741
And it always ends the same way.

36:18.785 --> 36:22.441
Neither mother nor daughter
can change that.

36:22.484 --> 36:24.399
Ever.

36:25.966 --> 36:27.968
BURNHAM:
You knew Spock would volunteer

36:28.011 --> 36:29.535
to go to the control room.

36:29.578 --> 36:30.840
You wanted me alone.

36:32.320 --> 36:33.408
Why?

36:37.020 --> 36:38.718
I want your help,
Michael Burnham.

36:38.761 --> 36:41.242
You are the most
effective tool

36:41.286 --> 36:43.810
to acquire the Sphere archive
from the Discovery.

36:43.853 --> 36:46.421
That is why I
lured you here.

36:46.465 --> 36:49.424
So that you, too,
can be reconstructed.

36:49.468 --> 36:51.600
SPOCK : Michael,
do you copy? Gant is Control.

36:51.644 --> 36:53.515
You must reboot the system

36:53.559 --> 36:55.300
to lock him out of the ship.

37:15.145 --> 37:17.539
Oh--

37:17.583 --> 37:19.585
COMPUTER: Authenticating.
Manual reboot commencing.

37:48.570 --> 37:51.007
There's only one outcome.

38:03.629 --> 38:05.065
Vulcan nerve pinch.

38:06.458 --> 38:07.197
Would be effective if I
still had nerve endings.

38:36.357 --> 38:38.446
Spock!I am working on it.

39:09.782 --> 39:11.566
The floor is magnetized.

39:13.655 --> 39:15.614
Once I realized
the nanobots contained

39:15.657 --> 39:17.833
ferromagnetic materials,
I had to calculate

39:17.877 --> 39:19.618
the correct electrical current
to run through

39:19.661 --> 39:21.141
the metal in the ship's floor
to immobilize them.

39:21.184 --> 39:23.448
I apologize for being so slow.

39:23.491 --> 39:25.537
You were right on time.

39:34.894 --> 39:37.331
Control was blocking
my tricorder.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.072
Or we would have
known what he was.

39:40.465 --> 39:43.250
I've regained
control of the ship.

39:46.427 --> 39:48.168
Dropping us
out of warp.

39:49.952 --> 39:52.128
Do you not wish to investigate
his programmed destination?

39:55.523 --> 39:57.743
Control said I wasn't
here by accident.

39:59.135 --> 40:02.443
It only went along
with our plan...

40:02.487 --> 40:05.881
to not raise suspicion
about its ultimate goal.

40:05.925 --> 40:08.536
Which was to turn me.

40:08.580 --> 40:10.451
Which indicates Control
has identified you

40:10.495 --> 40:12.453
as the true threat
to its objectives.

40:12.497 --> 40:15.630
The one variable it
cannot account for.

40:15.674 --> 40:17.415
This was its attempt
to eliminate that variable.

40:19.895 --> 40:22.071
So maybe there's still
a chance to stop it.

40:22.115 --> 40:23.856
Maybe there is something
in the signals

40:23.899 --> 40:25.945
that can help us finish
what my mom started.

40:25.988 --> 40:27.381
We must return
to the Discovery.

40:33.343 --> 40:34.693
PIKE:
TheDiscovery
is now in possession

40:34.736 --> 40:36.085
of a raw time crystal.

40:38.784 --> 40:40.786
How do you plan
to utilize it?

40:40.829 --> 40:43.919
The three last signals have yet
to reveal themselves.

40:43.963 --> 40:46.313
I believe they'll bring
clarity to that topic.

40:46.356 --> 40:48.707
Stamets and Reno
are working to stabilize

40:48.750 --> 40:51.144
the crystal's
volatile properties.

40:51.187 --> 40:52.580
So...

40:54.103 --> 40:56.323
Tell me, Captain.

40:56.366 --> 40:58.760
What did the monks
ask in return?

41:02.808 --> 41:05.288
What I experienced
is for me alone.

41:08.901 --> 41:12.382
That's a promise
that I made to your son.

41:14.776 --> 41:17.823
You saw him?

41:17.866 --> 41:20.216
You talked to him?

41:20.260 --> 41:22.392
I don't think I could
explain it if I tried.

41:25.395 --> 41:26.484
Oh, and he, uh...

41:28.007 --> 41:30.183
...he asked me
to return this to you.

41:32.272 --> 41:35.014
The insignia of
the torchbearer.

41:35.057 --> 41:38.757
I had given it to him before
I sent him down to Boreth.

41:39.888 --> 41:42.195
Well, Tenavik said

41:42.238 --> 41:45.677
that it, uh, helped him
a-along his own journey.

41:47.461 --> 41:50.029
He's where he needs to be
now and...

41:50.072 --> 41:52.031
no longer needs it.

41:52.074 --> 41:53.380
Tenavik?

42:02.258 --> 42:04.173
That is a good name.

42:09.222 --> 42:12.007
Thank you, Captain.

42:13.139 --> 42:14.706
But your, your son, uh...

42:17.360 --> 42:19.624
...he was meant to be on Boreth.

42:22.017 --> 42:24.933
I-I was meant to...

42:24.977 --> 42:26.674
be guided by him.

42:27.806 --> 42:29.503
So it seems that

42:29.547 --> 42:31.723
we all had, uh...

42:31.766 --> 42:35.814
and continue to have,
a part to play.

42:37.642 --> 42:39.165
BURNHAM:
Control isn't just contained

42:39.208 --> 42:40.514
to Leland anymore.

42:40.558 --> 42:42.603
It has the ability
to co-opt people

42:42.647 --> 42:44.213
and entire ships
without being detected.

42:44.257 --> 42:45.475
Do we know where
their ship was going?

42:46.825 --> 42:49.131
Just outside
Federation space.

42:49.175 --> 42:50.568
There's nothing there.

42:50.611 --> 42:52.047
There's a reason for everything
Control does.

42:52.091 --> 42:54.615
I'll alert
Starfleet as to...Captain?

42:54.659 --> 42:56.922
That's a Section 31 ship.

43:02.057 --> 43:04.364
They are all Section 31 ships.

43:04.407 --> 43:05.408
They're coming for the data.

43:07.193 --> 43:08.716
For us.

43:08.760 --> 43:10.631
The signal brought us here
for a reason.

43:10.675 --> 43:13.373
We have the time crystal.SARU:
Captain.

43:14.940 --> 43:17.116
30 ships.

43:17.159 --> 43:18.378
Nearly their entire fleet.

43:20.902 --> 43:22.687
PIKE:
We'll jump until we can figure
out how to power the crystal.

43:22.730 --> 43:25.385
BURNHAM:
They'll keep following us.

43:25.428 --> 43:27.430
Sir, it took a supernova
to power that crystal.

43:27.474 --> 43:29.911
We don't have
the tools we need.

43:29.955 --> 43:33.698
And we don't have the time
to figure out alternatives.

43:33.741 --> 43:35.743
And we can't wait
for another signal to show up.

43:35.787 --> 43:36.875
What do you propose?

43:36.918 --> 43:40.052
We're outgunned.

43:40.095 --> 43:42.924
We can't delete the data.

43:42.968 --> 43:44.534
That leaves us
only one option.

43:46.362 --> 43:48.538
We destroy the ship.

44:04.772 --> 44:06.644
Bryce.

44:06.687 --> 44:09.559
Send a priority-one message
on a secure channel

44:09.603 --> 44:11.387
to Enterprise'sXO:
"Set rendezvous course,

44:11.431 --> 44:13.476
"maximum warp,
and prepare emergency passages

44:13.520 --> 44:15.565
for full crew complement."

44:17.306 --> 44:19.265
Owosekun, initiate
verification procedures

44:19.308 --> 44:20.962
for auto-destruct sequence

44:21.006 --> 44:23.573
and send a ship-wide alert:
