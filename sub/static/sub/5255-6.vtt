26:01.160 --> 26:02.627
- "Protect this body and soul."
- No, no, no!

26:02.661 --> 26:04.696
"Sanctify this vessel."

26:04.730 --> 26:06.664
Stop!

26:06.699 --> 26:08.800
"Leave this body. Burn away."

26:08.834 --> 26:10.101
Please...

26:10.136 --> 26:12.470
- listen...
- "Leave this body. I command you."

26:12.505 --> 26:14.439
- Traitor!
- "Leave this body."

26:14.473 --> 26:16.207
How could you let them do this to me?

26:16.242 --> 26:18.710
"Burn away. Come into the light."

26:18.744 --> 26:20.612
Please. I'll do anything.

26:20.646 --> 26:22.180
- I'll do anything.
- "Come into the light.

26:22.214 --> 26:23.615
- Burn away."
- I'm sorry.

26:23.649 --> 26:25.717
- Please!
- "I command you, leave this body."

26:25.751 --> 26:27.919
- You'll kill us both.
- "Sanctify this vessel.

26:27.953 --> 26:30.255
- Every shadow has its light."
- I'm sorry.

26:30.289 --> 26:32.757
"Banish the spirit that
inhabits Clementine."

26:32.792 --> 26:35.126
You... you shut your mouth!

26:35.161 --> 26:36.828
[Snarling]

26:36.862 --> 26:39.464
Focus, Alex.

26:39.498 --> 26:42.000
[Clementine snarling]

26:42.034 --> 26:43.802
"Protect this body and soul.

26:43.836 --> 26:45.370
Sanctify this vessel."

26:45.404 --> 26:46.971
Why are you letting them hurt me, Izzie?

26:47.006 --> 26:49.874
- Why?
- "Every shadow has its light.

26:49.909 --> 26:52.210
Banish the spirit that
inhabits Clementine."

26:52.244 --> 26:53.878
- Izzie.
- "Protect this body.

26:53.913 --> 26:55.380
Burn away."

26:55.414 --> 26:57.782
[Snarling shriek]

27:00.186 --> 27:01.252
Again, Alex, again.

27:01.287 --> 27:02.887
"Every shadow has its light.

27:02.922 --> 27:05.690
"Banish the spirit that
inhabits Clementine.

27:05.724 --> 27:07.692
- "Protect this body and soul.
- [Clementine snarling]

27:07.726 --> 27:11.396
"Sanctify this vessel
so this soul can live on.

27:11.430 --> 27:13.765
Leave this body. Burn away."

27:13.799 --> 27:15.500
Michael, what's happening to her?

27:15.534 --> 27:17.469
- Be patient.
- "Come into the light.

27:17.503 --> 27:19.170
- I command you."
- [Shrieking, snarling]

27:19.205 --> 27:21.039
"Burn away.

27:21.073 --> 27:22.841
"Leave this body.

27:22.875 --> 27:24.676
"Burn away.

27:24.710 --> 27:28.746
"Sanctify. Sanctify.

27:28.781 --> 27:32.016
- Sanctify."
- [Gasping]

27:32.051 --> 27:34.252
"Sanctify."

27:34.286 --> 27:37.255
[Echoing exhale]

27:37.289 --> 27:40.158
Forgive me.

27:54.473 --> 27:57.842
[Laughs]

28:09.421 --> 28:11.256
My baby.

28:15.194 --> 28:17.996
Mom?

28:18.030 --> 28:20.932
My baby.

28:30.309 --> 28:32.577
My baby.

28:35.414 --> 28:38.750
[Laughs]

28:38.784 --> 28:41.286
Izzie. Izzie.

28:41.320 --> 28:46.291
Izzie.

28:46.325 --> 28:49.360
I can't believe you came back.

28:49.395 --> 28:52.063
- I can't believe you came back.
- [Laughs]

28:52.097 --> 28:55.033
You are beautiful. You are beautiful.

28:59.205 --> 29:02.006
Thank you. Thank you.

29:02.041 --> 29:05.009
[Both sniffling, laughing]

29:05.044 --> 29:08.413
[Gasping]

29:12.885 --> 29:15.019
What... Michael.

29:15.054 --> 29:17.288
What's happening? What's happening to her?

29:17.323 --> 29:19.357
- She can't breathe.
- Michael.

29:22.895 --> 29:24.395
Alex?

29:24.430 --> 29:25.630
Michael, help her.

29:25.664 --> 29:29.067
- Do something!
- Michael!

29:29.101 --> 29:32.403
I can't.

29:32.438 --> 29:35.306
No one can. Your mother's spirit is gone.

29:35.341 --> 29:37.008
This is all that will ever be left.

29:37.042 --> 29:38.810
This is your fault!

29:38.844 --> 29:42.113
Claire, I... I'm... I'm sorry.

29:42.147 --> 29:44.582
Get off of me. You...

29:44.617 --> 29:46.017
Claire, I'm sorry.

29:46.051 --> 29:50.154
I couldn't. I tried, Claire. I tried.

30:05.851 --> 30:07.419
Where are all the others?

30:07.453 --> 30:08.920
I pulled the session forward an hour.

30:08.955 --> 30:11.423
Sorry, did you not get word?

30:14.961 --> 30:18.463
I'm torn.

30:18.497 --> 30:23.935
Should I stand, or should I sit for this?

30:23.970 --> 30:25.170
Please.

30:25.204 --> 30:26.972
The suspense is killing me.

30:27.006 --> 30:30.842
David, you negotiated
quite a deal with Arika.

30:30.876 --> 30:33.979
- Good for both sides.
- Thank you.

30:34.013 --> 30:37.782
But information can never
compete with knowledge.

30:37.817 --> 30:40.518
You overpromised, and she embellished.

30:40.553 --> 30:42.587
Heh, Helena's air force is nowhere near

30:42.621 --> 30:45.256
as formidable as you were told.

30:45.291 --> 30:47.092
All the other members of
the senate were relieved

30:47.126 --> 30:48.426
that I found out in time,

30:48.461 --> 30:50.028
thankful that we didn't give away

30:50.062 --> 30:53.498
our invaluable technology
for one B-52 bomber.

30:54.900 --> 30:57.135
I think if you investigate further...

30:57.169 --> 30:58.670
It's over, David.

30:58.704 --> 31:03.375
She conned you.

31:03.409 --> 31:05.210
What about her?

31:05.244 --> 31:06.444
Arika?

31:06.479 --> 31:08.313
We need her.

31:08.347 --> 31:10.248
She needs us.

31:10.282 --> 31:12.217
Our deal is she goes back to Helena.

31:12.251 --> 31:14.719
To do what?

31:14.754 --> 31:17.722
She'll jump straight
back into bed with Evelyn,

31:17.757 --> 31:19.791
literally, and stab you in the back.

31:19.825 --> 31:22.594
There will be no Evelyn.

31:22.628 --> 31:24.896
It's time for a leadership
change in Helena,

31:24.930 --> 31:27.899
and as you know, Arika has
many loyalists in her homeland.

31:27.933 --> 31:30.101
I don't want just an alliance.

31:30.136 --> 31:33.371
I want influence, control.

31:33.406 --> 31:35.240
Once Arika has got rid of Evelyn,

31:35.274 --> 31:39.778
our agreement is that
Vega will help govern them.

31:39.812 --> 31:43.114
Yeah, well, I hope your
sick heart beats long enough

31:43.149 --> 31:46.117
to enjoy your new city of crazy women.

31:46.152 --> 31:50.388
Consul Whele, there is
one other order of business

31:50.423 --> 31:52.424
before you go.

31:55.828 --> 31:58.496
We did hold the no-confidence vote,

31:58.531 --> 32:01.666
yours being the only vote that wasn't cast.

32:01.700 --> 32:03.768
If you wish to do so now, I'll make sure

32:03.803 --> 32:07.772
that it's recorded accurately.

32:07.807 --> 32:13.178
Well, I vote confidence of course.

32:13.212 --> 32:14.913
Then it's unanimous.

32:14.947 --> 32:16.781
Thank you, Consul.

32:21.887 --> 32:23.655
[Chuckles]

32:29.161 --> 32:30.729
I've been trying to call you all day.

32:30.764 --> 32:32.597
Where were you?

32:32.632 --> 32:35.797
You should've seen what
happened in the senate.

32:46.011 --> 32:48.813
You okay?

32:48.848 --> 32:52.183
I know.

32:52.218 --> 32:53.918
- Sweetheart...
- I know.

32:58.991 --> 33:02.360
I spoke with her.

33:02.394 --> 33:05.530
I held her in my arms.

33:09.268 --> 33:13.905
You didn't want to let her go.

33:13.939 --> 33:16.875
Neither did I.

33:16.909 --> 33:20.578
- Where is she?
- She's safe.

33:27.286 --> 33:29.888
I understand.

33:29.922 --> 33:33.491
I think I understand.

33:33.526 --> 33:35.093
But the people of Vega won't.

33:35.127 --> 33:36.394
Well, people don't need to know.

33:36.428 --> 33:39.097
People don't need to
know anything, do they?

33:43.068 --> 33:44.669
No.

33:44.703 --> 33:47.272
And they never will.

33:47.306 --> 33:49.374
But they wouldn't want you as their leader.

33:49.408 --> 33:54.512
They wouldn't trust you, and neither can I.

33:54.547 --> 33:57.448
As soon as this wedding is over,

33:57.483 --> 34:01.119
you're gonna get up there,
and you are gonna tell the city

34:01.153 --> 34:05.356
that you have done everything
that you possibly can,

34:05.391 --> 34:07.725
and then you're gonna step down.

34:07.760 --> 34:10.293
- Claire, I don't think...
- No.

34:12.464 --> 34:14.465
This isn't negotiable.

34:52.504 --> 34:56.608
William, is it not painfully obvious

34:56.641 --> 34:59.043
that I want to be alone?

35:03.716 --> 35:06.017
Something wrong?

35:06.051 --> 35:07.685
Yes, Father.

35:07.720 --> 35:10.688
Something is wrong.

35:10.723 --> 35:13.757
Those guards you sent won't be returning.

35:13.792 --> 35:15.526
What did you do?

35:15.561 --> 35:19.197
My acolytes need protecting

35:19.231 --> 35:21.733
at all costs.

35:24.637 --> 35:27.138
From the day you were born,

35:27.172 --> 35:30.441
the first time I held you in my arms,

35:30.476 --> 35:34.812
I knew you were destined
to be nothing but a curse.

35:34.847 --> 35:39.050
Weak, useless in every conceivable way.

35:39.084 --> 35:40.184
Are you finished?

35:40.219 --> 35:42.987
No. You're finished.

35:43.022 --> 35:45.657
Beg, plead, sell your infected soul.

35:45.691 --> 35:47.292
It won't matter.

35:47.326 --> 35:50.361
Nothing you can do will
save you from this betrayal.

35:52.264 --> 35:53.598
[Trigger cocks]

36:06.078 --> 36:08.046
I can't believe this, William.

36:11.517 --> 36:12.884
For the first time,

36:12.918 --> 36:16.321
I can honestly say I'm proud of you.

36:19.024 --> 36:20.858
Son, you come across a wounded animal,

36:20.893 --> 36:23.528
you got to put it down.

36:23.562 --> 36:25.496
You almost did it when
you sent the soldiers

36:25.531 --> 36:28.199
into the agri-tower. But...

36:28.233 --> 36:32.437
Want to make sure a job's done,
you got to do it yourself, huh?

36:34.039 --> 36:37.275
It's what you've always wanted.

36:37.309 --> 36:41.346
Take your best shot, son.

36:41.380 --> 36:44.782
But let me give you a word of advice.

36:44.817 --> 36:46.918
If you do have the balls to do this,

36:46.952 --> 36:49.654
you better not miss.

36:49.688 --> 36:53.925
That's my boy.

36:53.959 --> 36:57.729
Show me how strong you really are.

37:02.601 --> 37:06.170
[Laughing]

37:20.452 --> 37:21.552
[Grunts]

37:44.457 --> 37:46.491
Just like a stream or a river,

37:46.525 --> 37:49.327
constantly changing, the
stream you draw is a stream

37:49.361 --> 37:51.195
long gone, no longer relevant.

37:51.230 --> 37:53.631
But don't let me discourage you.

37:53.666 --> 37:56.167
When have you known me to be discouraged?

37:56.201 --> 37:58.039
Do you really think the
child is the only one

37:58.074 --> 37:59.239
who could ever read these?

37:59.274 --> 38:01.175
From what I know of Father,

38:01.209 --> 38:02.710
he's never been that predictable.

38:02.744 --> 38:05.513
Which is why I'm asking
for discretion, secrecy.

38:05.547 --> 38:07.982
Confine these images to memory only.

38:08.016 --> 38:11.519
In return, the Vermeer is yours.

38:11.553 --> 38:13.554
Deal.

38:15.724 --> 38:17.325
Now, stop looking at me like that.

38:17.359 --> 38:19.660
Your word is the only thing
stronger than your mind.

38:19.695 --> 38:21.728
I'll be needing it now.

38:25.167 --> 38:27.802
Gabriel will not see the markings.

38:27.836 --> 38:30.370
You have my word.

38:35.510 --> 38:37.345
What's going on?

38:37.379 --> 38:40.314
What... William?

38:40.349 --> 38:42.149
Father.

38:42.184 --> 38:44.685
Your time of darkness has ended.

38:44.720 --> 38:47.488
I will help bring you into the light.

38:47.522 --> 38:48.556
What... what light?

38:48.590 --> 38:51.959
What are you talking about?

38:54.096 --> 38:56.030
The light of Gabriel.

38:57.566 --> 39:00.534
Where am I? What is all this?

39:00.569 --> 39:02.370
Talk to me, son. Please.

39:02.404 --> 39:05.660
I want to save you, Father.

39:05.695 --> 39:09.981
We all have faith that you can be saved.

39:15.104 --> 39:18.407
Son, I... I know I've... I've...

39:18.441 --> 39:21.810
I've made mistakes.
I-I-I've...

39:21.844 --> 39:24.980
and I'm sorry for that.

39:25.014 --> 39:27.682
Shh, quiet now.

39:27.717 --> 39:29.918
Quiet.

39:29.952 --> 39:31.486
Uhh!

39:31.521 --> 39:34.623
Ah! You little son...!

39:34.657 --> 39:37.059
You want to talk about being saved?

39:37.093 --> 39:39.261
I saved you!

39:39.295 --> 39:42.764
I've been saving you your entire life!

39:46.769 --> 39:49.504
What's that? [Panting]

39:49.539 --> 39:51.740
I'm sorry. Sorry.

39:51.774 --> 39:54.176
Just trying to get... get
through to you, that's all.

39:54.210 --> 39:56.812
What are you do...
Please, William, William.

39:56.846 --> 39:59.314
I... Please.

39:59.348 --> 40:00.982
[Panting, murmuring]

40:01.017 --> 40:02.317
Please, don't.

40:02.351 --> 40:04.285
Don't do this.

40:05.621 --> 40:07.889
Please, William, stop it right now!

40:07.924 --> 40:10.859
My hope is that you will
one day learn to accept

40:10.893 --> 40:13.962
the love of the Archangel Gabriel.

40:13.996 --> 40:16.665
[Groaning]

40:16.699 --> 40:18.767
Son, there must be another way.

40:18.801 --> 40:22.104
There is only one way.

40:22.138 --> 40:26.408
All: Where one breaks, one becomes strong.

40:26.442 --> 40:29.678
Where one is strong, we are all strong.

40:29.712 --> 40:32.514
- Aah!
- In Gabriel's name.

40:32.548 --> 40:35.050
In Gabriel's name.

40:35.084 --> 40:38.120
All: In Gabriel's name. In Gabriel's name.

40:38.154 --> 40:40.021
- Aah!
- In Gabriel's name.

40:40.056 --> 40:42.023
[Crack]

40:46.662 --> 40:49.764
[Crying]

40:49.799 --> 40:52.134
It's okay, Father.
