WEBVTT

01:07.966 --> 01:10.141
My boys.

01:24.639 --> 01:26.687
Oh, shoot.

01:26.719 --> 01:31.231
Shoot.

01:37.407 --> 01:39.071
You're not real.

01:39.104 --> 01:40.831
You...

01:40.864 --> 01:42.623
You're not real.

01:45.248 --> 01:48.287
One.

01:48.320 --> 01:51.488
Two.

01:51.521 --> 01:54.175
Three.

02:08.032 --> 02:09.377
No.

02:09.410 --> 02:11.041
Go away!

02:11.074 --> 02:13.825
Go away, leave!

02:21.443 --> 02:23.937
No, go away.

02:29.347 --> 02:29.890
Mom?

02:29.923 --> 02:31.074
I can't.

02:31.107 --> 02:34.498
No baby, no,
stay up there, Aiden!

02:34.531 --> 02:35.874
Stay up there.

02:35.908 --> 02:39.266
Don't you come down here,
you stay with your brother.

02:41.123 --> 02:42.851
No, no, no, no,
you stay right there.

02:42.884 --> 02:44.962
Don't you go,
you leave them alone.

02:44.996 --> 02:46.115
Take me!

02:50.917 --> 02:52.963
I'll go.

02:57.733 --> 03:00.740
I'll go if you
leave them alone.

03:08.357 --> 03:09.668
I swear.

03:16.101 --> 03:18.053
I deserve it.

03:24.806 --> 03:27.077
I deserve it.

05:31.342 --> 05:34.349
An American doctor, living in Haiti, has vanished,

05:34.382 --> 05:36.013
and with him, thousands of dollars

05:36.046 --> 05:39.182
of earthquake relief money
that he was in charge of.

05:39.214 --> 05:41.390
Dr. Cody Chase, who ran a mental health hospital

05:41.422 --> 05:43.214
outside of Port-au-Prince, Haiti,

05:43.246 --> 05:45.165
has been missing for three weeks.

05:45.198 --> 05:48.429
Local authorities have
suspended their investigation.

05:48.463 --> 05:51.118
After the earthquake that rocked Haiti, in 2010,

05:51.151 --> 05:52.654
Dr. Cody Chase was put in charge

05:52.687 --> 05:54.062
of hundreds of thousands of dollars

05:54.095 --> 05:55.438
of earthquake relief money,

05:55.471 --> 05:57.486
and became a bit of a local hero.

05:57.520 --> 06:00.399
But "Hardline Investigates"
discovered a checkered past,

06:00.431 --> 06:02.447
involving drug dealing, assault,

06:02.479 --> 06:04.431
and accusations of embezzlement.

06:04.463 --> 06:08.303
This raises even more questions
about what really happened.

06:08.336 --> 06:10.831
Did Cody Chase revert back to his old ways

06:10.865 --> 06:12.591
and abscond with the money?

06:12.624 --> 06:13.999
Or did the darker forces of Haiti,

06:14.032 --> 06:16.271
filled with corruption, violence and gangs,

06:16.305 --> 06:18.224
get the best of a man just trying to

06:18.256 --> 06:20.048
turn his life around?

06:20.080 --> 06:22.384
Only Haiti knows.

06:30.225 --> 06:31.632
I'm looking at your records, Mr. Chase,

06:31.665 --> 06:34.576
and you did previously request an extension.

06:34.610 --> 06:36.625
Unfortunately, we can't do that, since we have

06:36.658 --> 06:37.937
some past due payments.

06:37.970 --> 06:39.281
I-- I understand, I-- I just,

06:39.313 --> 06:41.041
you would really be doing me a favor

06:41.074 --> 06:43.217
if you could just help me
out and extend my prescription.

06:43.250 --> 06:44.465
I haven't been late on my payments

06:44.498 --> 06:46.033
until recently.

06:46.066 --> 06:48.081
But why do you need an extension?

06:48.114 --> 06:50.514
Because my prescription
is only good for three months,

06:50.546 --> 06:54.481
and, please, you would really be helping me out.

06:54.515 --> 06:57.746
I'm sorry, sir, that's the best I can do.

06:57.779 --> 07:00.274
Okay, look.

07:00.307 --> 07:02.707
I am trying to make ends meet, okay?

07:02.739 --> 07:04.979
I lost my job, I lost my benefits,

07:05.011 --> 07:07.282
I am moving out of my condo, as we speak.

07:07.315 --> 07:10.163
I don't have time to keep going back and forth

07:10.195 --> 07:11.891
to the doctor's office.

07:11.924 --> 07:13.778
I'm sorry, sir, that's the best I can do.

07:13.812 --> 07:14.963
Oh, my God.

07:14.996 --> 07:15.923
Ah!

07:15.956 --> 07:17.299
Dammit, you suck.

07:17.332 --> 07:18.355
No need to be rude, sir.

07:18.388 --> 07:19.571
Thank you for calling.

07:19.604 --> 07:20.179
No!

07:20.212 --> 07:21.075
No, no, no, no!

07:21.108 --> 07:23.603
No, hello, hello, hello?

07:23.636 --> 07:25.011
Oh, what next?

07:28.373 --> 07:30.932
Moving?

07:30.965 --> 07:33.140
Again.

07:38.005 --> 07:40.052
So much for sentimentality.

07:40.086 --> 07:42.740
I gave at the office.

07:42.774 --> 07:47.349
Nice to see you, too.

07:47.381 --> 07:50.229
Pack your bags.

07:50.262 --> 07:52.661
HI wants us to go to Haiti for a longer segment

07:52.694 --> 07:55.541
about Cody's disappearance.

07:55.574 --> 07:57.397
Us?

07:57.431 --> 07:58.613
You're the tabloid TV reporter.

07:58.646 --> 08:01.014
Dirty laundry is your gig, not mine.

08:04.023 --> 08:05.878
Oh, come on, Aiden.

08:05.911 --> 08:06.998
You know what I do,

08:07.031 --> 08:08.534
so I had to twist things around a bit,

08:08.567 --> 08:10.486
that's part of the job, and it worked.

08:10.519 --> 08:12.023
And I got you a spot on the crew,

08:12.055 --> 08:14.039
which wasn't easy.

08:14.071 --> 08:16.694
I was expecting a "thank you".

08:19.608 --> 08:21.751
Got it all figured out, as usual, huh?

08:21.784 --> 08:26.455
Everything except why you're so goddamn stubborn.

08:26.488 --> 08:28.983
Cody and I lost each other a long time ago.

08:29.016 --> 08:30.520
You should know that.

08:30.552 --> 08:32.663
You were there.

08:37.529 --> 08:40.760
And I put that behind me.

08:40.793 --> 08:43.544
You should, too.

08:43.577 --> 08:44.856
Behind me?

08:44.889 --> 08:46.040
Yes.

08:46.073 --> 08:48.153
My entire life has fallen apart since then

08:48.185 --> 08:49.625
and I don't know why.

08:49.658 --> 08:51.193
I was on track to be Vice President,

08:51.226 --> 08:54.521
now I can barely hold a job.

08:54.554 --> 08:56.409
I have been popping Benizone
for the last five years

08:56.442 --> 08:58.041
just to keep myself from jumping off a bridge

08:58.074 --> 08:59.289
in my sleep!

08:59.322 --> 09:00.601
That's how much that fucked me up

09:00.634 --> 09:01.817
five years ago.

09:01.851 --> 09:06.394
And you want me just to put that behind me?

09:06.426 --> 09:09.466
And on top of that my benefits just ran out.

09:13.371 --> 09:18.010
We're dead to each other.

09:18.043 --> 09:22.074
Why should I help him now?

09:22.108 --> 09:25.179
Because he's your brother.

09:25.211 --> 09:26.618
Despite all your rivalry bullshit

09:26.652 --> 09:30.235
he wouldn't give up on you.

09:30.268 --> 09:34.331
So don't you dare give up on him.

09:34.364 --> 09:36.795
Again.

09:42.621 --> 09:44.956
No.

09:44.989 --> 09:47.324
He gave up on me first.

09:47.357 --> 09:50.236
I don't know why, and it doesn't matter.

09:50.269 --> 09:52.508
But we're in different worlds now.

09:52.541 --> 09:56.157
And wherever we end up...

09:58.909 --> 10:02.749
...that's where we should stay.

10:14.207 --> 10:17.822
You know the past can only haunt you

10:17.854 --> 10:19.870
if you let it.

10:57.377 --> 10:59.712
Take care
of your brother.

11:10.850 --> 11:13.057
I abandoned him.

11:33.859 --> 11:34.434
Aiden.

11:34.467 --> 11:36.515
Aiden, wake up.

11:43.396 --> 11:45.955
Again.

11:45.988 --> 11:48.355
Yeah.

11:53.989 --> 11:58.659
They're getting worse.

11:58.693 --> 12:00.996
More real each time.

12:05.830 --> 12:09.988
I came by to give you these.

12:10.022 --> 12:13.349
Guess I was a little late.

12:13.382 --> 12:15.749
Where did you get this?

12:15.782 --> 12:18.725
Being a B-list celebrity has its perks.

12:21.990 --> 12:24.645
I need something stronger than this.

12:34.119 --> 12:36.134
Let's go find my brother.

12:41.895 --> 12:44.231
Haiti is a nation in recovery.

12:44.264 --> 12:47.174
Since the 2010 earthquake, Haiti has struggled

12:47.208 --> 12:48.679
to get back on its feet.

12:48.712 --> 12:50.343
But if anyone has the spirit in them,

12:50.376 --> 12:52.423
to fight back from tough times,

12:52.456 --> 12:53.703
it's the Haitians.

12:53.736 --> 12:55.335
This is where Cody Chase decided to try

12:55.368 --> 12:56.679
and make a difference.

12:56.713 --> 12:58.024
Perhaps in a land full of people

12:58.056 --> 12:59.751
trying to start their lives over,

12:59.785 --> 13:02.312
he could as well.

13:02.344 --> 13:04.520
He found this vacant building in a remote village

13:04.552 --> 13:07.368
thirty minutes outside of the Haitian capitol

13:07.401 --> 13:09.128
of Port-au-Prince.

13:09.161 --> 13:12.232
Here he took his patients
in an effort to build again.

13:12.265 --> 13:15.816
This is the last place
Dr. Cody Chase was seen alive.

13:20.106 --> 13:21.513
This is where Hardline Investigates

13:21.546 --> 13:24.233
begins our search for a man in turmoil,

13:24.266 --> 13:27.401
a man shrouded in mystery, a man gone missing.

13:27.434 --> 13:30.377
That's a bit overly dramatic, isn't it?

13:30.411 --> 13:31.305
Do you mind?

13:31.338 --> 13:35.818
We're still filming.

13:35.851 --> 13:37.290
That's good, thanks.

13:37.323 --> 13:39.146
Don't you think we should at least meet our host

13:39.179 --> 13:40.490
before you try to win your Emmy?

13:40.523 --> 13:41.737
We might as well get some work done

13:41.771 --> 13:44.971
while we're waiting for the welcome wagon.

13:46.923 --> 13:48.138
<i>Bonjour.</i>

13:48.171 --> 13:51.691
Dr. Yveline Montase, hospital director.

13:51.724 --> 13:53.035
I apologize for my tardiness,

13:53.067 --> 13:55.531
but we had a patient emergency.

13:55.564 --> 13:58.827
Nice to finally meet all of you in person.

13:58.860 --> 14:00.747
This is Duane, my cameraman.

14:00.780 --> 14:02.187
<i>-Hi.
- Bonjour.</i>

14:02.220 --> 14:04.491
And Peanut, my associate producer.

14:04.525 --> 14:05.099
Hi.

14:05.132 --> 14:05.963
<i>Bonjour.</i>

14:05.996 --> 14:08.972
Welcome to Haiti.

14:09.005 --> 14:10.251
And you are?

14:10.285 --> 14:10.988
Oh, hi.

14:11.021 --> 14:14.027
This is Aiden Konstipovan.

14:14.061 --> 14:16.332
Aiden Konstipovan my assistant.

14:16.365 --> 14:17.164
<i>Bonjour.</i>

14:17.197 --> 14:17.804
Welcome.

14:17.837 --> 14:19.180
Please, come.

14:19.213 --> 14:20.845
Let me show you around.

14:20.877 --> 14:23.821
I am so grateful that you can do this story.

14:23.853 --> 14:27.820
It's important that the world
know how far we've come.

14:27.854 --> 14:30.765
And yes, how far we've yet to go.

14:30.798 --> 14:32.045
This place is massive.

14:32.078 --> 14:33.133
Oh, yes, it is.

14:33.166 --> 14:36.013
Most of it is abandoned and boarded up.

14:36.046 --> 14:38.349
Not touched in years.

14:38.382 --> 14:41.390
But we fixed up a small area that we can use.

14:41.422 --> 14:45.998
Still a work in progress, as you can see.

14:46.031 --> 14:48.718
If this place doesn't have hot water, I'm out.

14:48.751 --> 14:49.326
Who cares?

14:49.359 --> 14:50.478
It's badass.

14:50.511 --> 14:52.942
Think of it as urban camping.

14:52.975 --> 14:54.414
You mean the ghetto.

14:54.448 --> 14:58.190
Something only hipsters think is cool.

15:04.336 --> 15:07.279
Um, "Konstipovan"?

15:07.312 --> 15:09.711
We don't want them to know
that you're his brother.

15:09.744 --> 15:11.279
Could be dangerous.

15:11.312 --> 15:14.575
Yeah, but, "Konstipovan"?

15:14.609 --> 15:17.008
It's Croatian for "constipated".

15:17.040 --> 15:18.416
Thought it fit.

15:18.449 --> 15:21.680
Dude, this place is freakin' amazeballs.

15:21.713 --> 15:23.184
Amazeballs.

15:23.217 --> 15:25.584
Wow, is that what they're saying these days?

15:25.617 --> 15:27.376
I am getting old.

15:27.409 --> 15:29.809
Stick with me, Pops, I got your back.

15:29.841 --> 15:31.248
I'll make you relevant again.

15:31.282 --> 15:34.545
What made you think I was ever
relevant to begin with?

15:36.626 --> 15:39.824
Doctor, when did you first start working here?

15:39.858 --> 15:43.889
I started shortly after our last
hospital director,

15:43.922 --> 15:46.482
Dr. Chase, went missing.

15:46.514 --> 15:50.001
He did a very good thing founding this hospital.

15:50.034 --> 15:54.098
Mental illness is highly
stigmatized in our culture.

15:54.130 --> 15:56.145
It's a shame what's happened.

15:56.179 --> 15:58.450
Was there ever any investigation?

15:58.483 --> 16:00.882
Any police that we can speak to?

16:00.915 --> 16:03.250
The local police were of little assistance

16:03.283 --> 16:05.843
and no one else here cares to talk.

16:05.876 --> 16:09.586
This village doesn't exactly
embrace western beliefs

16:09.620 --> 16:11.923
and medicine.

16:11.956 --> 16:14.227
And the things that they do believe in

16:14.260 --> 16:16.947
are not to be talked about.

16:16.980 --> 16:21.460
You'll find this village has many secrets.

16:27.732 --> 16:30.932
Is there a secret Starbucks around somewhere?

16:30.965 --> 16:32.820
'Cause I'd love a Frappuccino.

16:32.853 --> 16:34.132
Jeez, pussy.

16:34.165 --> 16:38.485
Please, let's continue.

16:55.670 --> 16:58.486
Aaahh!

16:58.518 --> 17:00.406
Maybe I should get your back.

17:00.439 --> 17:01.654
What was that about?

17:01.686 --> 17:03.126
My apologies.

17:03.159 --> 17:06.965
We are in a mental hospital with very few staff.

17:06.999 --> 17:09.303
Some patients we allow to roam freely,

17:09.335 --> 17:11.894
but others we must restrain.

17:11.928 --> 17:15.223
We've had to move this one a few times already.

17:15.256 --> 17:16.567
Please.

17:16.598 --> 17:19.670
Let's get you settled, huh?

17:41.850 --> 17:46.072
Feel free to use our lobby as your workplace.

17:46.105 --> 17:50.265
It is much more comfortable here.

17:50.297 --> 17:51.864
Oh, hello.

17:51.898 --> 17:53.272
It's great.

17:53.306 --> 17:55.705
Welcome home.

17:55.738 --> 17:58.170
This is really great.

17:58.202 --> 18:02.937
<i>Ewenso, desann bou ou ak pran yo nan chanm yo!</i>

19:26.336 --> 19:27.358
Hey, Boss.

19:27.392 --> 19:29.023
We're American news crew, right?

19:29.056 --> 19:30.142
Yeah.

19:30.176 --> 19:32.158
Well, I was gonna go on that Starbucks run,

19:32.192 --> 19:33.951
just fuckin' with you, there's no Starbucks,

19:33.983 --> 19:37.535
but when I came back this was on the doorstep.

19:39.520 --> 19:40.447
Has Bree seen this?

19:40.480 --> 19:42.847
No, you're the first.

19:56.289 --> 19:58.816
"I heard you're investigating
the hospital disappearances.

19:58.849 --> 20:00.033
"My friend worked at the hospital,

20:00.065 --> 20:02.113
"he sent me this before he vanished.

20:02.145 --> 20:05.569
"I am not in a position to help,
but maybe you Americans can.

20:05.602 --> 20:10.401
Sincerely, a friend of Emmanuel."

20:12.002 --> 20:12.834
Shall we?

20:12.866 --> 20:14.401
Yeah.

20:14.434 --> 20:17.953
Yes, indeed.

20:17.987 --> 20:20.098
All right, so these files are huge

20:20.130 --> 20:21.762
so they're taking forever to load

20:21.795 --> 20:25.378
so we're just gonna watch them, one by one, okay?

20:28.387 --> 20:29.859
Is the camera on now?

20:29.891 --> 20:32.035
It's on?

20:32.067 --> 20:32.835
Cody.

20:32.867 --> 20:34.595
Okay, here we go.

20:34.627 --> 20:36.898
Entry number seven, in Project Resurrection,

20:36.932 --> 20:38.531
exploring voodoo's role in seizures

20:38.563 --> 20:41.571
associated with autoscopy
of temporal lobe epilepsy.

20:41.604 --> 20:42.787
I'm Dr. Cody Chase.

20:42.820 --> 20:44.899
This is hospital administrator, Billy Kross.

20:44.932 --> 20:47.267
Behind the camera is our assistant, Emmanuel.

20:47.300 --> 20:49.795
And this is our newest patient,

20:49.828 --> 20:52.067
dubbed by the orderlies as, Ke Kontan Nonm,

20:52.100 --> 20:54.084
or Happy Man.

20:54.117 --> 20:56.708
So, what's this guy's story?

20:56.741 --> 20:57.700
School principal.

20:57.733 --> 20:59.172
Post traumatic stress disorder

20:59.205 --> 21:02.020
after the earthquake killed
a bunch of his students.

21:02.053 --> 21:04.836
Probably couldn't handle the guilt.

21:04.870 --> 21:07.620
Looks like he had time for art classes.

21:07.654 --> 21:09.540
Yeah, he's been drawing these voodoo symbols

21:09.574 --> 21:11.556
the last few days.

21:11.590 --> 21:12.901
We're gonna need a real voodoo priest

21:12.934 --> 21:14.949
to analyze this.

21:14.982 --> 21:16.773
Have to call Papa J.

21:16.806 --> 21:21.190
Doc, the voodoo in this place is off the deep end,

21:21.222 --> 21:23.589
even for Haiti.

21:23.623 --> 21:27.013
I don't like swimmin' in the deep end.

21:27.047 --> 21:28.902
The fact that the village is, is a magnet

21:28.934 --> 21:31.046
for Haitian black magic, could be a godsend.

21:31.079 --> 21:32.326
I mean, we have all these resources

21:32.358 --> 21:34.182
at our fingertips to help us.

21:34.215 --> 21:35.334
Help us?

21:35.367 --> 21:37.415
They think this place is cursed.

21:37.447 --> 21:40.262
They say these patients aren't crazy.

21:40.296 --> 21:43.815
They're possessed by voodoo spirits.

21:43.847 --> 21:48.039
You-- you sound like you're
starting to believe it.

21:48.072 --> 21:51.335
All I know is, patients have been disappearing.

21:51.368 --> 21:53.255
- I've heard rumors.
- Yeah.

21:53.288 --> 21:56.135
Or, or they could have
just wandered off.

21:56.168 --> 21:59.944
We don't have the resources
to watch every patient 24/7.

21:59.976 --> 22:04.040
I'm saying there's some strange
stuff going on in this village.

22:04.073 --> 22:06.408
Stuff that we will never even begin to understand.

22:06.441 --> 22:08.808
Alright, well, what do you want me to do?

22:08.841 --> 22:10.536
We've done everything known to western medicine

22:10.569 --> 22:11.528
at our disposal,

22:11.561 --> 22:15.401
it is time to try something else.

22:15.433 --> 22:17.704
It's easy to fear the things we don't understand.

22:17.738 --> 22:21.257
We just need to understand it.

22:21.290 --> 22:24.873
I need you to document
some research on this for me.

22:24.906 --> 22:26.249
I'll review it when I get back.

22:26.283 --> 22:27.082
Back?

22:27.114 --> 22:28.489
Where are you going?

22:28.522 --> 22:29.993
Gonna go to the village.

22:30.026 --> 22:32.074
I'm gonna find Papa J.

22:32.106 --> 22:35.306
We need our voodoo priest back.

22:41.131 --> 22:44.363
Entry 12 in Project Resurrection.

22:44.395 --> 22:47.243
Today's class: Voodoo 101.

22:47.275 --> 22:49.323
"Voodoo is an ancient religion

22:49.356 --> 22:51.850
"that worships a supreme, silent god.

22:51.884 --> 22:56.107
"This silent god works
through countless lesser spirits

22:56.140 --> 22:59.819
"who interact with the human world."

22:59.852 --> 23:02.156
Okay, now can you get some shots of this stuff,

23:02.188 --> 23:03.404
you know, and edit it in?

23:03.436 --> 23:06.636
"Each spirit has their own aspect of life

23:06.668 --> 23:07.883
"they rule over.

23:07.917 --> 23:11.980
"Such as Erzulie Dantor, the goddess of romance

23:12.012 --> 23:12.971
"and jealousy.

23:13.005 --> 23:17.132
"Baron Samedi, the god of death.

23:17.166 --> 23:19.500
"Kalfu, black magic,

23:19.534 --> 23:22.828
"guardian of the entrance to the spirit world,

23:22.862 --> 23:24.237
"the crossroads."

23:24.270 --> 23:26.797
Boy, this stuff is really creepin' me out.

23:26.829 --> 23:28.397
Here.

23:28.430 --> 23:32.045
This is about the drawing
we found in Happy Man's room.

23:32.078 --> 23:34.253
"Voodoo has symbols representing

23:34.286 --> 23:35.854
"various voodoo spirits.

23:35.886 --> 23:40.461
"Each spirit has his or her own symbol

23:40.495 --> 23:43.118
"which can vary from region to region

23:43.150 --> 23:45.966
"and serves as a beacon for the spirit world.

23:45.999 --> 23:50.159
"During voodoo rituals
the symbols are usually drawn

23:50.191 --> 23:53.135
"on the floor and call the spirit

23:53.167 --> 23:55.278
"to descend towards earth."

23:55.312 --> 23:56.942
Holy...

23:56.976 --> 23:59.791
Every house of voodoo worships differently.

23:59.823 --> 24:04.591
Papa J's house believes that the demons

24:04.624 --> 24:06.383
are in the deepest, darkest corners

24:06.416 --> 24:08.335
of the spirit world.

24:08.368 --> 24:11.055
Papa J gives this place a name,

24:11.088 --> 24:13.519
<i>lanfe' vodou.</i>

24:13.553 --> 24:17.488
This is where they keep their possessed souls.

24:17.521 --> 24:20.592
Here, Cody, check this out.

24:20.625 --> 24:22.160
"The bizango

24:22.193 --> 24:26.256
"are a black magic secret society of sorcerers

24:26.290 --> 24:29.296
"who use voodoo to serve the more evil

24:29.329 --> 24:31.377
"and violent spirits."

24:31.409 --> 24:34.257
See, this is what I was talking about.

24:34.290 --> 24:36.561
I been hearing rumors about the bizango

24:36.594 --> 24:38.513
kidnapping patients.

24:42.963 --> 24:44.305
People say they take them

24:44.338 --> 24:47.473
deep into the abandoned areas of the building

24:47.507 --> 24:50.897
for human sacrifices.

24:50.931 --> 24:54.610
I been hearing things at night,
and I know you have, too.

25:02.547 --> 25:06.227
This place is cursed.

25:06.259 --> 25:10.355
And if we don't leave, so are we.

25:10.388 --> 25:14.292
Check this out.

25:14.324 --> 25:15.923
No...

25:15.957 --> 25:20.371
No, no, no, no.

25:20.405 --> 25:22.387
It froze, this video's corrupt or something.

25:22.421 --> 25:23.476
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

25:23.509 --> 25:24.147
Can you fix it?

25:24.181 --> 25:25.524
Y... Yeah, I think so,

25:25.557 --> 25:27.444
it's just, last time this happened it took,

25:27.477 --> 25:28.916
like, a whole day to debug, so...

25:28.949 --> 25:30.548
Come on, man.

25:30.581 --> 25:34.868
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

26:18.424 --> 26:19.511
Hello?

26:19.544 --> 26:21.240
Yes, I am looking for Papa J.

26:21.272 --> 26:22.775
My name is Aiden,

26:22.809 --> 26:24.983
I'm with a television company
from the United States

26:25.016 --> 26:26.551
and I was wondering if I could just ask you

26:26.585 --> 26:29.624
a few questions...

26:29.657 --> 26:31.768
Well, yes, I am staying at the Saint Dymphna.

26:31.801 --> 26:36.248
Um, is there any way that I could just as...

26:36.281 --> 26:38.777
Hello?

26:41.529 --> 26:43.352
Hi, yes, uh, my name is Aiden

26:43.385 --> 26:45.721
and I'm working with an American
television company.

26:45.753 --> 26:47.609
I was wondering if I could
just ask you a few questions

26:47.642 --> 26:50.393
regarding the disappearance...

26:50.426 --> 26:52.857
Hello?

27:00.666 --> 27:03.738
Hey.

27:03.771 --> 27:06.810
Coffee?

27:06.843 --> 27:09.050
How's it going?

27:09.083 --> 27:10.842
Something's wrong with the phones in this country,

27:10.875 --> 27:13.914
they keep dropping my calls.

27:14.235 --> 27:16.859
Maybe they didn't like my brother, either.

27:16.891 --> 27:18.362
Yeah, you hate your brother so much

27:18.395 --> 27:20.891
you flew all the way over here to save him.

27:20.923 --> 27:23.611
You have a lump of coal for a heart.

27:23.644 --> 27:25.403
I have a heart?

27:25.436 --> 27:26.907
Maybe I should get one these witch doctors

27:26.940 --> 27:28.347
to operate on me to find it, huh?

27:28.380 --> 27:29.211
Hm.

27:29.244 --> 27:30.683
Maybe.

27:30.717 --> 27:33.244
<i>Actually, we prefer houngan.</i>

27:33.276 --> 27:36.283
Jean Drouillard, assistant to Papa J,

27:36.317 --> 27:38.363
at your service.

27:38.397 --> 27:40.188
Witch doctor.

27:44.669 --> 27:48.060
I assisted Papa J when he consulted Dr. Cody

27:48.094 --> 27:51.165
on voodoo treatments for the patients.

27:51.197 --> 27:54.172
I was not here when he disappeared.

27:54.206 --> 27:56.477
Well, we do appreciate your help.

27:56.510 --> 27:57.565
The best way to help you,

27:57.598 --> 27:59.901
and your stupid American reality TV,

27:59.934 --> 28:02.813
is to ask you to leave this village.

28:05.662 --> 28:07.773
You trying to scare us stupid Americans away

28:07.807 --> 28:11.709
with your voodoo bullshit?

28:11.743 --> 28:14.238
Ah, stupid Americans.

28:16.863 --> 28:19.422
Voodoo is a world religion.

28:19.455 --> 28:21.822
Over 400 years old.

28:21.856 --> 28:23.678
It's a melange of African traditions

28:23.712 --> 28:26.175
and European Christianity.

28:26.207 --> 28:29.727
You should not reject what you do not understand.

28:29.760 --> 28:32.287
You should not fear the people of Haiti,

28:32.319 --> 28:35.039
you should fear its spirits.

28:35.072 --> 28:36.895
What happens to all of us in life

28:36.928 --> 28:39.232
is the will of the spirits.

28:39.264 --> 28:42.816
They must be honored in ceremony and ritual.

28:42.848 --> 28:44.768
If the spirits are satisfied with our offerings

28:44.800 --> 28:48.352
they will bring good fortune.

28:48.385 --> 28:50.368
And if they're not satisfied?

28:50.401 --> 28:52.768
What do they bring?

28:52.801 --> 28:54.624
Punishment.

28:54.657 --> 28:55.776
By whom?

28:55.810 --> 28:57.121
The spirits?

28:57.153 --> 29:00.512
Or the bizango?

29:00.546 --> 29:01.536
I should go.

29:01.570 --> 29:05.857
Wait.

29:05.890 --> 29:07.873
Cody is my brother.

29:07.906 --> 29:09.954
I have to find him.

29:09.986 --> 29:11.649
If someone was kidnapping the patients

29:11.683 --> 29:13.121
then maybe Cody was trying to stop them.

29:13.154 --> 29:14.369
Maybe he...

29:14.403 --> 29:18.114
Maybe he took the money and ran, hm?

29:18.147 --> 29:20.898
I don't believe he did.

29:23.971 --> 29:25.571
I found this video with their experiments

29:25.603 --> 29:27.587
on the patients.

29:27.619 --> 29:30.754
He was exploring the effects of voodoo on them.

29:30.787 --> 29:32.354
Where did you get that?

29:32.388 --> 29:33.666
It's complicated.

29:33.700 --> 29:37.091
Us stupid Americans are like that.

29:37.124 --> 29:39.363
Now.

29:39.396 --> 29:41.411
Where is Papa J?

29:41.444 --> 29:43.556
I need to talk to him.

29:47.460 --> 29:51.236
Papa J disappeared with the rest of them.

29:51.269 --> 29:52.932
I've been looking for that old man ever since

29:52.964 --> 29:55.620
without a clue.

29:55.653 --> 29:57.892
Until now.

30:01.733 --> 30:05.444
We still have a couple videos we've yet to view.

30:05.478 --> 30:09.413
You wanna find out what happened to them?

30:09.445 --> 30:12.164
Let's find out together.

30:14.950 --> 30:16.901
The last few days we've been experiencing

30:16.934 --> 30:19.397
some oddities.

30:22.726 --> 30:25.957
These bloody handprints appeared out of nowhere.

30:27.878 --> 30:28.837
Reminds me,

30:28.871 --> 30:30.566
when my brother and I were little,

30:30.599 --> 30:33.670
we used to paint our hands
and put 'em on the wall.

30:33.703 --> 30:35.399
God.

30:35.431 --> 30:39.239
Mom was pissed.

30:39.271 --> 30:41.030
Got this?

30:41.064 --> 30:43.271
This viscous fluid emanating from the walls

30:43.303 --> 30:47.367
has yet to be thoroughly tested,
but it appears to be blood.

30:54.376 --> 30:56.520
Is this really necessary, Kross?

30:56.552 --> 31:00.712
Unfortunately, yes, Doctor.

31:00.745 --> 31:04.744
This place has gotten weird
ever since we admitted him.

31:04.777 --> 31:06.888
He makes the other patients go bonkers.

31:06.921 --> 31:08.520
Okay, look, I just don't like to restrict him

31:08.553 --> 31:09.576
if we don't have to.

31:09.610 --> 31:10.792
Look.

31:10.826 --> 31:12.489
It's my job to keep this place safe.

31:12.521 --> 31:16.040
Let me do my job.

31:16.074 --> 31:17.033
See?

31:17.066 --> 31:18.793
See?

31:18.826 --> 31:20.617
That's what I mean.

31:20.650 --> 31:21.994
Look, fine, fine.

31:22.026 --> 31:26.538
You do your job your way and let
me handle this mess mine.

31:26.570 --> 31:27.977
Voodoo is not the answer, Doc.

31:28.010 --> 31:31.434
I am trying to use it to save them.

31:31.467 --> 31:33.034
They believe their curse.

31:33.066 --> 31:34.570
They have to confront that curse

31:34.603 --> 31:36.522
in their own minds.

31:36.555 --> 31:38.282
What do you know about being cursed?

31:38.315 --> 31:41.899
Everything.

31:41.931 --> 31:44.938
We all have our demons, Kross.

31:44.972 --> 31:48.074
Even you.

31:48.108 --> 31:50.155
What would you give to be rid of that thing

31:50.188 --> 31:53.739
that haunts you the most?

31:53.772 --> 31:56.043
Anything.

31:56.076 --> 31:58.220
So would I.

31:58.252 --> 32:00.715
So would they.

32:28.590 --> 32:31.245
I'm scared, Aiden.

32:31.278 --> 32:33.934
I'm really scared.

32:33.966 --> 32:35.725
You gotta get out of here.

32:35.759 --> 32:37.997
You were protected, but he's coming for you, too.

32:38.031 --> 32:39.374
He's coming for you, too.

32:39.406 --> 32:40.142
Who, who?

32:40.174 --> 32:43.214
Who's coming for me?

32:43.246 --> 32:46.030
The Tormentor.

33:17.361 --> 33:20.400
Holy shit.

33:20.433 --> 33:24.688
I was just in my childhood basement with Cody.

33:24.722 --> 33:26.320
It was so,

33:26.353 --> 33:29.809
it was so real.

33:29.841 --> 33:32.081
The Tormentor was there.

33:32.113 --> 33:33.553
Who?

33:33.586 --> 33:35.601
The Tormentor.

33:35.634 --> 33:37.009
It's what we used to call
a night terror

33:37.042 --> 33:40.177
that Cody would have when we were younger.

33:40.210 --> 33:44.978
I didn't start havin' 'em until a few years ago.

33:45.010 --> 33:48.081
I was standing on that thing.

33:48.115 --> 33:51.154
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

33:53.651 --> 33:56.051
That is Kalfu.

33:56.083 --> 33:57.875
The dark guardian of the crossroads,

33:57.907 --> 34:02.130
who allows access in and out of the spirit world.

34:02.164 --> 34:03.635
Aiden.

34:03.668 --> 34:05.235
Aiden!

34:05.267 --> 34:07.923
You traveled into the spirit world.

34:07.956 --> 34:11.699
How?

34:11.732 --> 34:14.388
The spirits must be using your memories

34:14.420 --> 34:17.812
to draw you and Cody together.

34:17.844 --> 34:18.643
For what?

34:18.677 --> 34:20.916
I do not know.

34:23.637 --> 34:25.139
Happy Man was there.

34:25.174 --> 34:26.739
He knows something, we need to talk to him,

34:26.772 --> 34:27.603
he knows something, now.

34:27.637 --> 34:29.235
Happy Man is possessed.

34:29.268 --> 34:33.748
He cannot respond because he's not of this earth.

34:33.781 --> 34:37.525
We should ask the spirit who possesses him.

34:37.556 --> 34:40.628
How do we do that?

35:01.399 --> 35:03.255
The last staff member has left

35:03.287 --> 35:07.607
and the patients are locked down.

35:07.640 --> 35:11.831
<i>Ewenso, mwen te panse mwen
te di nou ranje sa yo limye.</i>

35:19.288 --> 35:22.743
For the record, I do not agree with this.

35:22.776 --> 35:27.063
But out of respect for Dr. Chase's work,

35:27.097 --> 35:29.976
I will allow this to proceed.

35:30.009 --> 35:34.808
Let's get this over with.

35:44.249 --> 35:47.289
Before a spirit helps us

35:47.322 --> 35:50.457
we must satisfy them with offerings.

35:50.490 --> 35:54.361
Usually food, drink, and blood.

36:02.042 --> 36:05.882
The fresher and warmer the blood,

36:05.915 --> 36:10.107
the more life power for the spirit.

36:10.139 --> 36:13.435
Sometimes the spirit possesses people

36:13.467 --> 36:16.186
to continue its quest for blood.

36:39.101 --> 36:40.988
Don't be afraid.

37:03.167 --> 37:07.102
When an angry spirit possesses a person,

37:07.135 --> 37:10.653
the spirit must be appeased.

37:10.687 --> 37:13.630
If the spirit is satisfied, he, in turn,

37:13.663 --> 37:18.015
releases the body and blesses us with rain,

37:18.047 --> 37:20.447
crops, good luck.

37:20.479 --> 37:25.214
If he's not satisfied, he will be angry!

38:01.378 --> 38:03.841
Duane, wait, don't go!

38:10.306 --> 38:15.042
<i>Lespri, tanpri pale ak nou.</i>

38:15.074 --> 38:18.786
<i>Ou te rele m', Linglesou,</i>

38:18.818 --> 38:23.362
<i>lespri a krwaze semen yo.</i>

38:23.395 --> 38:25.923
He said,

38:25.955 --> 38:29.859
"You have summoned me, Linglesou,

38:29.891 --> 38:33.379
spirit of vengeance, to assist you

38:33.412 --> 38:37.987
in finding the spirit lost in the darkness."

38:38.020 --> 38:41.059
Peanut, why?

38:41.093 --> 38:44.803
<i>Yon ansorseleur majik</i>

38:44.836 --> 38:47.171
<i>nwa reklamasyon</i>

38:47.205 --> 38:51.748
<i>domen sou kote sa a nan mond ou.</i>

38:51.781 --> 38:56.196
"A black magic sorcerer has claimed domain

38:56.229 --> 38:58.628
over this place in your world."

38:58.661 --> 39:03.205
<i>Jwenn sa a ansorseleur epi w ap jwenn</i>

39:03.237 --> 39:07.941
<i>nanm pedi ou bloke nan kacho l 'yo.</i>

39:07.974 --> 39:11.781
"Find this sorcerer and you will find

39:11.814 --> 39:15.813
your soul trapped in his dungeon."

39:15.846 --> 39:17.989
Help, Aiden, help!

39:29.479 --> 39:33.062
<i>Si ou sove l 'soti</i>

39:49.480 --> 39:50.791

39:50.825 --> 39:54.919
"If you rescue him from the dungeon,

39:54.953 --> 39:57.736
I will let you go in peace.

39:57.769 --> 40:00.712
But if you do not,

40:00.745 --> 40:04.392
you will pay homage to me for eternity...

40:06.793 --> 40:09.865
...with your blood!"

40:09.897 --> 40:10.696
No!

40:10.730 --> 40:12.264
No, no, no!

40:12.298 --> 40:13.001
No, no!

40:13.034 --> 40:14.537
Aaahh!

40:14.570 --> 40:17.225
Aaahh!

40:21.002 --> 40:23.818
Aaahh!

40:28.234 --> 40:32.106
<i>Nan san yo nan lespri mwen!</i>

40:38.155 --> 40:41.418
Where'd they go?

40:43.212 --> 40:46.635
It's... it's Happy Man.

40:46.667 --> 40:49.515
He has taken her into the spirit world

40:49.547 --> 40:52.011
to escape us.

40:52.044 --> 40:54.699
But he will be back.

40:54.732 --> 40:57.195
Wait, wait, wait, what?

41:01.261 --> 41:05.228
He's going to sacrifice them.

41:05.260 --> 41:08.172
He'll be back for our blood, too.

41:08.205 --> 41:10.476
Oh, ding-ding-ding-ding-ding, I'm sorry,

41:10.509 --> 41:11.404
this is where I get off.

41:11.437 --> 41:12.877
Wait, Duane, wait!

41:12.909 --> 41:14.189
What about Bree?

41:14.221 --> 41:15.180
I'm sorry.

41:15.213 --> 41:16.940
I can't do this.

41:16.974 --> 41:21.741
You selfish prick!

41:21.774 --> 41:23.437
Whoa.

41:23.470 --> 41:26.413
What the fuck just happened?

41:29.518 --> 41:33.709
Really?

41:33.743 --> 41:35.885
That is enough!

41:35.919 --> 41:39.630
You tell us exactly what in the world is going on!

41:41.903 --> 41:44.558
Of course.

41:44.591 --> 41:48.334
But we are no longer in our world.

42:06.481 --> 42:09.616
I will try to explain.

42:09.648 --> 42:13.584
We were in the real world,
where only humans dwell.

42:16.145 --> 42:18.832
For the spirit to come here

42:18.865 --> 42:21.936
they need to possess a human.

42:21.969 --> 42:25.712
The ceremony pushed us into the crossroads

42:25.746 --> 42:27.793
where we are now trapped.

42:27.825 --> 42:30.609
We are still part of the physical world,

42:30.642 --> 42:34.034
but the spirits have much more power here.

42:34.066 --> 42:37.266
We cannot leave until we appease them.

42:37.298 --> 42:40.977
Happy Man has taken Bree and the others

42:41.010 --> 42:44.210
into the spirit world to escape us.

42:45.970 --> 42:48.978
But blood that is sacrificed to the spirits

42:49.011 --> 42:53.746
must come from the physical plane of existence.

42:53.779 --> 42:57.554
So, Happy Man will emerge,

42:57.587 --> 43:02.163
no doubt, back to the crossroads

43:02.196 --> 43:04.915
to take Bree to the sorcerer

43:04.948 --> 43:08.467
as a sacrifice to the spirits.

43:08.500 --> 43:10.131
Well, then we don't have much time.

43:10.164 --> 43:12.211
We need to find this black magic sorcerer

43:12.244 --> 43:13.523
and get Bree back.

43:13.556 --> 43:15.027
Is Happy Man the sorcerer?

43:15.061 --> 43:16.595
Maybe someone from the village?

43:16.629 --> 43:17.940
I don't know.

43:17.973 --> 43:19.411
It could be one of the patients as well.

43:19.445 --> 43:20.564
What about Papa J?

43:20.597 --> 43:22.548
Oh, my lad, it could not be him.

43:22.581 --> 43:23.124
Are you sure?

43:23.157 --> 43:23.860
Then who?

43:23.893 --> 43:25.140
Kross.

43:25.173 --> 43:26.676
Like, well, how can we trust you, Jack?

43:26.709 --> 43:27.989
Duane, come on.

43:28.021 --> 43:29.588
No, man, I'm having trouble processing

43:29.621 --> 43:31.252
all this crazy shit.

43:31.285 --> 43:33.077
People are dying and disappearin'

43:33.109 --> 43:35.765
and reappearin' out of thin air.

43:35.798 --> 43:37.973
Bree and Happy Man and my ex.

43:38.005 --> 43:38.869
Who?

43:38.902 --> 43:40.309
Who did you see?

43:40.342 --> 43:42.198
For a minute there I thought I saw

43:42.230 --> 43:43.381
my ex fiancee.

43:43.414 --> 43:46.230
Wh... what happened with her?

43:49.526 --> 43:52.438
I got her pregnant.

43:52.470 --> 43:55.285
And I told her I would take
care of her and the baby,

43:55.319 --> 43:57.110
but I thought she was cheating on me so,

43:57.143 --> 44:00.566
as a huge "fuck you" I left them both.

44:00.599 --> 44:04.983
And she tried to kill herself because of it.

44:07.256 --> 44:11.862
Anyone else have a vision from their past?

44:11.896 --> 44:14.359
I uh...

44:14.392 --> 44:17.335
I thought I saw my big brother.

44:17.368 --> 44:20.375
Please, tell us.

44:20.408 --> 44:24.247
Ricky was your basic, overprotective big brother

44:24.281 --> 44:28.056
and got mad at my asshole
boyfriend at the time, Puck.

44:28.088 --> 44:29.944
I told Ricky I'd break up with Puck,

44:29.977 --> 44:32.536
but I lied.

44:32.569 --> 44:37.048
I saw Puck about to jump Ricky,
but I was so mad at Ricky

44:37.081 --> 44:40.793
I didn't warn him.

44:40.825 --> 44:44.921
He broke Ricky's jaw.

44:44.954 --> 44:49.177
He's my big brother, I should have had his back.

44:51.771 --> 44:54.490
Of course.

44:54.522 --> 44:57.305
During the ceremony Happy Man revealed

44:57.338 --> 45:00.954
that this place was cursed
by the spirit Linglesou.

45:00.987 --> 45:01.818
Is that bad?

45:01.851 --> 45:03.194
Linglesou.

45:03.227 --> 45:06.522
Linglesou is the evil spirit who punishes those

45:06.555 --> 45:08.955
who go back on their word.

45:08.987 --> 45:11.419
Tears the flesh of humans.

45:11.451 --> 45:14.299
Craves fresh, warm blood.

45:14.331 --> 45:15.867
Oh, that sounds bad.

45:15.900 --> 45:18.810
He's punishing us for our broken promises.

45:21.724 --> 45:22.331
Wait.

45:22.364 --> 45:24.603
Our broken promises?

45:24.636 --> 45:27.771
What did you do?

45:27.805 --> 45:30.587
I assisted Papa J and Cody.

45:30.621 --> 45:34.972
But, I ran.

45:35.005 --> 45:39.836
I'm here now to keep my word to Cody and find him.

45:39.869 --> 45:40.764
What about Bree?

45:40.797 --> 45:42.172
Look, we gotta save her from crazy guy

45:42.206 --> 45:43.965
who can teleport people through space.

45:43.997 --> 45:45.437
God, I wish we could do that.

45:45.469 --> 45:49.501
Then we could just follow 'em.

45:49.533 --> 45:53.853
If Happy Man can take passengers, can I?

45:53.886 --> 45:55.613
It's worth a try.

45:55.646 --> 45:56.477
So?

45:56.510 --> 45:58.366
Who do we rescue first?

45:58.398 --> 46:01.661
Bree or Cody?

46:04.319 --> 46:05.822
Bree.

46:05.854 --> 46:09.566
The spirit world is composed of our memories.

46:09.598 --> 46:12.734
Aiden's memories of Cody trigger his descent

46:12.767 --> 46:14.526
into the spirit world.

46:14.559 --> 46:17.119
So we will start our search for Bree

46:17.151 --> 46:19.839
in Aiden's memories of Cody.

46:22.816 --> 46:24.767
I don't understand.

46:29.824 --> 46:34.719
This line is Cody's memories.

46:34.753 --> 46:37.951
He is here, we hope.

46:37.985 --> 46:41.056
This line is Bree's memories.

46:41.089 --> 46:44.736
This is where she will be.

46:44.769 --> 46:48.832
This line is your memory, Aiden.

46:48.865 --> 46:52.256
We need to follow your memory to a time

46:52.290 --> 46:55.169
you, Bree, and Cody shared together.

46:55.202 --> 46:59.681
From this moment we can go
down Bree's line of memories.

46:59.714 --> 47:02.497
Those will lead us to the whereabouts

47:02.530 --> 47:04.289
of where she is now.

47:04.322 --> 47:07.329
Did you share a moment like that together?

47:09.507 --> 47:11.137
Aiden!

47:11.171 --> 47:12.994
Did you?

47:13.026 --> 47:14.338
Yes.

47:14.371 --> 47:16.258
Yes, we did.

47:16.291 --> 47:18.818
Then we must find this moment.

47:21.187 --> 47:22.242
Duane.

47:22.275 --> 47:24.323
Is that last video ready yet?

47:29.795 --> 47:32.451
Find something specific that triggers a memory

47:32.484 --> 47:34.403
you both share.

47:38.948 --> 47:40.836
Kross.

47:40.868 --> 47:42.148
Kross.

47:42.180 --> 47:43.235
You want blood?

47:43.269 --> 47:44.291
Take mine!

47:44.325 --> 47:46.404
Take mine!

47:46.437 --> 47:48.739
Kross, what happened?

47:51.333 --> 47:54.020
He said in order to free my grandson

47:54.053 --> 47:56.709
I needed to provide a sacrifice of blood.

47:56.741 --> 47:58.212
So I did.

47:58.245 --> 48:01.093
Who said that?

48:01.125 --> 48:03.044
The spirit.

48:03.078 --> 48:07.780
Kross, your grandson has been dead for five years.

48:07.814 --> 48:10.789
The chicken wasn't enough.

48:10.822 --> 48:11.685
He needs more blood.

48:11.719 --> 48:12.389
Help us.

48:12.422 --> 48:13.030
Help us all!

48:13.062 --> 48:14.565
Hey, help yourself.

48:14.599 --> 48:16.133
We'll go into the crossroads, hey.

48:16.167 --> 48:20.517
And we'll find our demons together.

48:20.551 --> 48:21.477
No!

48:21.511 --> 48:23.366
No!

48:23.398 --> 48:26.278
We need to leave this place!

48:26.311 --> 48:29.094
It's cursed!

48:29.127 --> 48:30.118
We gotta get out of here...

48:30.151 --> 48:32.614
We make our stand now!

48:32.647 --> 48:34.726
Look, I've learned enough voodoo to take the fight

48:34.760 --> 48:39.079
to our demons in the spirit world.

48:39.111 --> 48:42.567
G... God be with you, Cody.

48:42.600 --> 48:44.647
'Cause I can't.

48:44.680 --> 48:46.247
Kross, Kross!

48:51.144 --> 48:53.863
If I don't come back,

48:53.897 --> 48:56.647
tell my brother, tell my brother I um...

48:59.913 --> 49:04.072
Tell him he didn't bring me into this.

49:04.105 --> 49:06.089
I brought it to him.

49:06.121 --> 49:08.168
And I'm sorry.

49:14.378 --> 49:16.617
Go Crocs.

49:24.746 --> 49:26.378
It's a poster.

49:29.515 --> 49:34.442
It's my brother's old apartment.

49:34.475 --> 49:36.459
We are in your memories.

49:36.491 --> 49:38.154
Oh, your memories stink.

49:38.187 --> 49:41.386
What's with the plastic?

49:41.419 --> 49:42.955
I have no idea.

49:52.748 --> 49:56.620
But this is definitely my brother's old apartment.

50:11.853 --> 50:13.100
How could you do this to me?

50:13.134 --> 50:15.276
I took care of you after Mom died!

50:15.310 --> 50:17.005
It's your fault she died.

50:17.037 --> 50:18.445
I didn't wanna do it, but you made me.

50:18.478 --> 50:20.077
You brought me into this!

50:20.110 --> 50:21.453
Into what?

50:21.485 --> 50:23.021
You've lost it, man.

50:23.054 --> 50:25.357
Aiden.

50:25.390 --> 50:28.013
Holy shit.

50:28.047 --> 50:29.389
What's happening to me?

50:29.422 --> 50:33.709
Aiden, you must remember, this isn't now.

50:33.743 --> 50:35.726
This is a memory.

50:35.759 --> 50:37.326
Don't get lost in it.

50:37.358 --> 50:38.254
No.

50:38.287 --> 50:40.206
But I've been here before.

50:40.239 --> 50:42.703
I am seeing things, I'm hearing things,

50:42.735 --> 50:45.006
I'm feeling things that I have felt before.

50:45.039 --> 50:47.247
It's like I'm reliving this and I don't know...

50:47.279 --> 50:51.535
You're not.

50:51.568 --> 50:55.983
This is five years ago.

50:56.016 --> 50:58.255
What, why can't they see us?

50:58.288 --> 51:00.527
They're in their own reality.

51:00.560 --> 51:02.159
We have to breech it to make contact.

51:02.192 --> 51:03.887
Do not talk to them.

51:03.921 --> 51:05.711
And if we do?

51:05.745 --> 51:07.311
We may be pulled in by their reality

51:07.345 --> 51:10.864
and lose ourselves.

51:10.897 --> 51:12.560
I stuck my neck out to get you

51:12.593 --> 51:13.936
that job interview and you blow it off

51:13.969 --> 51:15.376
to get drunk?

51:15.409 --> 51:16.464
Look at you!

51:16.497 --> 51:18.960
You're a goddamn waste of space.

51:18.993 --> 51:20.464
Damn you, Cody.

51:20.498 --> 51:23.857
How many more second chances
can I hand you to fuck up?

51:23.889 --> 51:26.001
How many you got?

51:29.010 --> 51:32.017
This was a few months before our fight.

51:32.050 --> 51:36.529
We're moving backward through your memories.

52:29.397 --> 52:30.869
Oh, Jesus Christ!

53:00.311 --> 53:02.103
Many believe that voodoo spirits

53:02.135 --> 53:06.006
are ghosts of ancestors past.

53:06.040 --> 53:10.455
A person's special talent or skill in life

53:10.488 --> 53:11.831
comes from a spirit.

53:11.864 --> 53:13.335
When the person dies,

53:13.368 --> 53:17.335
the spirit must be transferred to a living person.

53:17.369 --> 53:18.647
If it's not,

53:18.681 --> 53:21.335
then the dead person will return to plague

53:21.368 --> 53:22.872
their living relatives.

53:35.514 --> 53:39.097
Hey, where's Cody?

53:39.130 --> 53:40.857
Where's my buddy?

53:48.347 --> 53:52.026
There's my favorite guy.

53:52.058 --> 53:56.570
Oh, don't cry.

53:56.602 --> 53:58.490
Aiden, go play.

54:04.763 --> 54:07.291
Come on.

54:07.323 --> 54:09.051
Come on, now.

54:24.860 --> 54:27.900
You just do as I say,
everything will be all right.

54:27.932 --> 54:28.860
What are you doing?

54:28.892 --> 54:30.204
Stop it!

54:30.237 --> 54:33.019
No, stop it!

54:33.053 --> 54:34.460
No!

54:34.493 --> 54:37.500
Stop it!

54:37.533 --> 54:39.356
Help, Aiden, help!

54:47.677 --> 54:50.044
Whoa, easy.

54:50.078 --> 54:54.397
Dude, we lost ya there for a second.

54:54.430 --> 54:55.902
Yeah, I'm fine.

54:55.934 --> 54:58.557
But, what is this?

54:58.590 --> 54:59.869
Damn you, Cody.

54:59.902 --> 55:03.485
How many more second chances
can I hand you to fuck up?

55:03.519 --> 55:06.750
How many you got?

55:06.783 --> 55:09.086
We can't all be perfect like you, Aiden.

55:09.119 --> 55:11.615
Your perfect suit and your perfect job

55:11.647 --> 55:13.470
and your perfect girlfriend.

55:13.503 --> 55:16.351
Oh, yeah, right, Bree perfect.

55:16.383 --> 55:18.623
You just don't know what you got.

55:18.655 --> 55:20.478
If only you could see it.

55:20.512 --> 55:24.351
I've seen enough to know that she's not the one.

55:24.384 --> 55:27.583
Asshole.

55:27.616 --> 55:28.863
Bree!

55:28.896 --> 55:29.535
No.

55:29.568 --> 55:30.431
Wait, no!

55:30.465 --> 55:31.711
Don't stop her.

55:31.744 --> 55:33.536
We'll follow her memory back to the present.

55:33.568 --> 55:35.135
Up a level to the crossroads.

55:35.168 --> 55:36.512
Aiden!

55:36.544 --> 55:37.760
Aiden.

56:01.282 --> 56:03.073
Bree!

56:09.059 --> 56:12.065
Cody!

56:12.099 --> 56:13.666
No!

56:13.699 --> 56:15.202
No!

56:15.235 --> 56:19.266
No!

56:19.299 --> 56:22.178
Peanut!

56:44.741 --> 56:46.916
It's my fault.

56:46.949 --> 56:49.892
I brought her here.

56:49.925 --> 56:52.932
At least we know what happened
to Dr. Yveline and Papa J.

56:55.429 --> 57:00.101
I stopped Cody's bleeding, for now.

57:00.134 --> 57:02.084
I should have foreseen it.

57:02.118 --> 57:06.533
Foreseen what?

57:06.566 --> 57:09.541
Me and Papa J

57:09.574 --> 57:11.718
helped train Dr. Cody

57:11.750 --> 57:15.206
in just enough voodoo to care for the patients.

57:15.238 --> 57:17.605
But he always wanted more.

57:17.639 --> 57:21.318
Pompous American fool, I thought.

57:21.351 --> 57:24.262
I never believed he would call upon Linglesou

57:24.295 --> 57:27.270
to achieve that power we denied him.

57:27.303 --> 57:29.542
The power to fight the Tormentor.

57:29.575 --> 57:30.790
But he lost.

57:30.824 --> 57:33.959
So Linglesou claimed Cody's body as his own

57:33.992 --> 57:38.310
and became the black magic sorcerer.

57:38.344 --> 57:41.288
Can we get him out of here?

57:41.320 --> 57:43.591
His soul is lost somewhere.

57:43.624 --> 57:47.111
His body will not survive unless we find his soul.

57:51.912 --> 57:53.608
Oh, good Lord!

57:53.641 --> 57:55.688
What the...

57:55.721 --> 57:57.672
Is that...?

57:57.705 --> 57:59.625
Duane.

57:59.657 --> 58:02.568
This is the same image from the videos.

58:02.602 --> 58:05.192
Jean, what does this mean?

58:05.226 --> 58:08.201
This is a message from Dr. Cody.

58:08.233 --> 58:11.593
<i>He is trapped in lanfe' vodou.</i>

58:11.626 --> 58:13.513
Voodoo hell.

58:13.546 --> 58:15.977
So all we have to do is go down there

58:16.010 --> 58:17.449
and get him, then.

58:17.482 --> 58:18.441
Go down there,

58:18.475 --> 58:21.002
evade demons who swallow your soul,

58:21.034 --> 58:23.818
defeat the Tormentor, who imprisons Dr. Cody,

58:23.850 --> 58:27.850
and bring his soul back alive.

58:27.882 --> 58:29.610
Is that all?

58:29.643 --> 58:31.562
But you said if we don't mess with the memories,

58:31.595 --> 58:33.706
they won't mess with us.

58:33.739 --> 58:35.626
This place is different.

58:35.659 --> 58:38.315
In voodoo hell everything and everyone

58:38.347 --> 58:40.170
can hurt each other.

58:40.204 --> 58:42.603
And they will try.

58:42.635 --> 58:46.507
If your soul dies down there,
your body dies up here

58:46.540 --> 58:48.715
and vice versa.

58:48.748 --> 58:51.915
The body cannot live without the soul.

59:00.397 --> 59:02.380
Well, what are we waiting for?

59:02.413 --> 59:03.756
We're not getting any younger.

59:03.789 --> 59:04.876
No, no.

59:04.909 --> 59:06.477
He is my brother, my battle,

59:06.509 --> 59:09.868
I go alone.

59:09.901 --> 59:13.229
A long time ago when we were together

59:13.261 --> 59:15.180
I told you I'd follow you to hell and back

59:15.214 --> 59:18.445
no matter what.

59:18.478 --> 59:21.293
Well, here we are.

59:21.326 --> 59:24.333
Make room.

59:24.367 --> 59:28.206
This whole thing is making
me see things clearly now.

59:32.527 --> 59:36.526
My whole damn life I've been living for myself.

59:36.559 --> 59:40.335
But no more.

59:40.367 --> 59:41.550
I gotta get my daughter back

59:41.583 --> 59:43.854
and if this is gonna help me do it,

59:43.887 --> 59:46.062
then I'm in.

59:46.096 --> 59:47.822
Okay.

59:47.856 --> 59:50.446
That makes four of us.

59:50.480 --> 59:51.663
No.

59:51.696 --> 59:53.935
Three.

59:53.968 --> 59:55.727
I must remain here

59:55.760 --> 59:58.511
and send you deep into the spirit world.

59:58.544 --> 01:00:00.688
It's the only way.

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:04.688
Besides, I know what's down there.

01:00:04.721 --> 01:00:07.471
I will stay with Dr. Cody.

01:00:07.505 --> 01:00:11.280
You Americans may be simple,
but you are braver than I.

01:00:13.169 --> 01:00:14.897
So how do we know when we get to voodoo hell?

01:00:14.929 --> 01:00:17.136
Does it look like the DMV?

01:00:17.170 --> 01:00:20.145
These will be Aiden's memories.

01:00:20.177 --> 01:00:22.865
He will know where to find it.

01:00:26.002 --> 01:00:29.809
Are you scared?

01:00:29.842 --> 01:00:34.001
I'm terrified.

01:00:34.034 --> 01:00:35.858
Just wait.

01:00:42.898 --> 01:00:46.226
This is officially the worst shoot

01:00:46.259 --> 01:00:47.635
I've ever been on!

01:01:31.638 --> 01:01:33.013
Who's that in the picture?

01:01:33.046 --> 01:01:34.773
Hey, where's Cody?

01:01:34.806 --> 01:01:36.213
Where's my buddy?

01:01:36.246 --> 01:01:38.997
Our stepfather, Bob.

01:01:41.238 --> 01:01:45.014
Aiden, go play.

01:01:45.046 --> 01:01:46.838
Cody was frightened.

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:49.942
Didn't want the monster to hurt him anymore.

01:01:49.975 --> 01:01:51.990
Monster?

01:01:52.023 --> 01:01:53.462
Is Bob your Tormentor?

01:01:53.495 --> 01:01:56.822
I totally blocked...

01:01:56.855 --> 01:02:00.470
I totally blocked it out of my mind.

01:02:00.504 --> 01:02:03.542
We were just kids.

01:02:03.576 --> 01:02:06.007
I promised Cody from then on I'd protect him.

01:02:09.304 --> 01:02:13.336
I remember poisoning Bob's scotch.

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:18.584
He wanted a nightcap.

01:02:18.616 --> 01:02:21.656
So we gave it to him.

01:02:37.114 --> 01:02:38.649
Oh...

01:02:38.682 --> 01:02:40.024
No.

01:02:40.058 --> 01:02:44.249
He had it coming!

01:02:44.282 --> 01:02:46.778
You knew and you didn't do anything!

01:02:52.987 --> 01:02:56.474
I'm so sorry.

01:02:56.507 --> 01:03:00.954
I'm so sorry.

01:03:00.987 --> 01:03:02.874
I'll make it up to you.

01:03:02.908 --> 01:03:07.035
I'll make it up to you!

01:03:07.067 --> 01:03:10.203
Cody blamed it on me.

01:03:10.235 --> 01:03:11.354
He said he didn't want to do it,

01:03:11.388 --> 01:03:15.451
but I made him.

01:03:15.484 --> 01:03:17.851
Why did you do that to Bob?

01:03:17.884 --> 01:03:19.324
For you!

01:03:19.356 --> 01:03:22.779
I did that for you!

01:03:22.813 --> 01:03:23.931
Boss.

01:03:23.965 --> 01:03:26.428
Come on back now, Boss.

01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:28.252
I got your back.

01:03:33.276 --> 01:03:35.452
I remember now.

01:03:35.485 --> 01:03:38.365
I remember all of it.

01:03:38.397 --> 01:03:40.604
After we killed Bob,

01:03:40.638 --> 01:03:43.517
Mom covered up the evidence.

01:03:52.542 --> 01:03:57.118
She buried his body parts
in the hole in the basement.

01:03:57.150 --> 01:03:59.165
But she couldn't bury her guilt.

01:04:09.663 --> 01:04:11.871
I'm sorry.

01:04:19.296 --> 01:04:22.431
This is when Cody's night terrors started.

01:04:22.464 --> 01:04:24.383
When the Tormentor came.

01:04:29.665 --> 01:04:32.255
She had us all hypnotized
that we would bury the memories

01:04:32.289 --> 01:04:34.367
deep within us.

01:04:34.401 --> 01:04:36.672
So that they wouldn't haunt us.

01:04:39.585 --> 01:04:41.728
But I don't think it worked on Cody.

01:04:44.865 --> 01:04:46.368
Or my mom.

01:04:50.466 --> 01:04:53.729
I deserve this.

01:04:55.970 --> 01:04:57.761
I deserve this.

01:05:05.922 --> 01:05:08.066
Cody blamed me for Mom's suicide.

01:05:08.099 --> 01:05:10.082
I never wanted to do it, but...

01:05:10.115 --> 01:05:11.586
I didn't want to do it, but you made me!

01:05:11.619 --> 01:05:12.802
You brought me into it!

01:05:12.835 --> 01:05:14.626
But it was really all...

01:05:14.659 --> 01:05:19.138
But it was really all my fault.

01:05:19.171 --> 01:05:21.058
Wait a minute.

01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:28.034
Who... who's coming for me?

01:05:28.068 --> 01:05:30.083
The Tormentor.

01:05:33.796 --> 01:05:36.356
I'll make it up to you.

01:05:36.388 --> 01:05:38.691
I'll make it up to you.

01:05:47.845 --> 01:05:49.701
Aiden.

01:06:08.070 --> 01:06:12.038
I know what it is.

01:06:12.071 --> 01:06:15.878
The Tormentor wasn't Bob.

01:06:15.911 --> 01:06:20.646
It was our guilt.

01:06:20.679 --> 01:06:21.798
It always lurked there

01:06:21.831 --> 01:06:24.358
like a creature in the darkness until...

01:06:24.391 --> 01:06:28.359
until it finally became one.

01:06:28.391 --> 01:06:32.071
Drove Mom mad.

01:06:32.103 --> 01:06:35.175
Cody tried to fight it, but he lost.

01:06:37.032 --> 01:06:40.936
And now...

01:06:40.968 --> 01:06:42.567
now it's my turn.

01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:50.343
We have to rescue Cody.

01:06:50.377 --> 01:06:53.320
Where is he?

01:06:53.353 --> 01:06:54.664
He would have taken Cody to the place

01:06:54.697 --> 01:06:58.184
where he was most afraid of.

01:06:58.218 --> 01:07:01.608
Where Mom buried Bob.

01:07:03.593 --> 01:07:05.385
The hole.

01:07:43.692 --> 01:07:45.195
Shit.

01:07:45.228 --> 01:07:47.788
Okay, we got a problem.

01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:49.035
Happy Man's guarding Cody.

01:07:49.068 --> 01:07:50.508
Tortured souls are in there.

01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:52.363
God, of all the crazy people in this place

01:07:52.396 --> 01:07:54.796
I definitely hate him the most.

01:07:54.828 --> 01:07:57.868
Okay, we need to get him out of there.

01:07:57.900 --> 01:08:00.588
One of us needs to be bait.

01:08:00.621 --> 01:08:02.188
Not it.

01:08:02.221 --> 01:08:03.405
You stay.

01:08:03.437 --> 01:08:04.428
You need to find Cody.

01:08:04.461 --> 01:08:06.125
We'll create a diversion.

01:08:06.157 --> 01:08:06.700
A diversion?

01:08:06.734 --> 01:08:07.693
How?

01:08:07.725 --> 01:08:09.869
Introduce him to Bob, the pedophile?

01:08:09.901 --> 01:08:12.781
Yeah, sure, they can have
a "Hey, we're all crazy" party.

01:08:12.813 --> 01:08:14.445
That's not a bad idea.

01:08:14.477 --> 01:08:16.877
No, no, no, it's a bad idea because I was joking.

01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:20.332
Look, I know where to hide in Aiden's memories.

01:08:20.366 --> 01:08:22.798
We could lead Happy Man back up there,

01:08:22.830 --> 01:08:25.613
buy Aiden some time.

01:08:25.645 --> 01:08:27.438
Well, how will we know that the Tormentor

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:29.774
didn't get you?

01:08:29.807 --> 01:08:32.109
Because if I fail we all end up rotting in there

01:08:32.143 --> 01:08:35.438
for the rest of eternity.

01:08:35.470 --> 01:08:39.214
I was hoping for a text message.

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:44.687
Well.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:47.183
This is it.

01:08:47.215 --> 01:08:48.846
When I said "hell and back" I should have kept

01:08:48.879 --> 01:08:51.662
my big mouth shut.

01:08:51.696 --> 01:08:55.279
Well, we made it to hell.

01:08:55.312 --> 01:08:58.895
Now we just gotta make it back.

01:08:58.929 --> 01:09:02.831
Don't quit on me now.

01:09:02.865 --> 01:09:04.720
I never have.

01:09:09.328 --> 01:09:11.024
Okay.

01:09:14.961 --> 01:09:17.265
Let's go get your brother.

01:09:20.176 --> 01:09:23.408
All right.

01:09:32.787 --> 01:09:37.296
- Go, go, go, go!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

01:09:58.740 --> 01:10:00.755
Under the bed, under the bed.

01:10:00.788 --> 01:10:01.875
That's the worst place to hide!

01:10:01.908 --> 01:10:02.931
Do you have a better idea?

01:10:02.964 --> 01:10:03.571
Go!

01:10:03.604 --> 01:10:06.163
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

01:10:11.412 --> 01:10:13.460
This is a really fucking bad idea.

01:10:13.493 --> 01:10:14.900
Sh, sh.

01:12:01.691 --> 01:12:02.555
Come on, come on.

01:12:02.587 --> 01:12:03.163
Stop it!

01:12:03.195 --> 01:12:03.770
Come on.

01:12:03.803 --> 01:12:05.019
Stop!

01:12:05.051 --> 01:12:05.787
You are such a goof.

01:12:05.819 --> 01:12:08.538
What am I gonna do with you?

01:12:19.612 --> 01:12:22.012
We shouldn't do this.

01:12:22.045 --> 01:12:24.476
Happened once, let's just leave it at that, okay?

01:12:24.508 --> 01:12:26.172
Aiden's acting weird.

01:12:26.205 --> 01:12:27.836
Yeah, but he deserves it.

01:12:27.869 --> 01:12:30.300
Treating us both like shit.

01:12:30.333 --> 01:12:34.172
You deserve better.

01:12:36.958 --> 01:12:40.285
Oh, gosh.

01:12:40.317 --> 01:12:42.332
Oh, shit, it's Aiden!

01:12:42.366 --> 01:12:44.348
Ohhh, shit.

01:12:44.382 --> 01:12:45.405
Hide under the bed.

01:12:45.438 --> 01:12:48.093
That's a terrible idea.

01:12:48.126 --> 01:12:49.181
Oh, shit.

01:12:49.214 --> 01:12:51.101
Just be quiet.

01:13:00.703 --> 01:13:04.094
Where is she?

01:13:04.127 --> 01:13:05.662
What the hell are you talking about?

01:13:05.695 --> 01:13:06.527
I know she's in here.

01:13:06.559 --> 01:13:09.886
Tell me where she is.

01:13:09.919 --> 01:13:11.967
Don't ever tell me what to do again.

01:13:11.999 --> 01:13:13.503
Oh, so you're gonna be a man now?

01:13:13.536 --> 01:13:14.718
Yeah.

01:13:14.752 --> 01:13:17.887
Because you weren't man enough.

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:20.479
You motherfucker!

01:13:24.896 --> 01:13:28.991
Get off of me!

01:13:29.024 --> 01:13:30.751
How could you do this to me?

01:13:30.785 --> 01:13:34.048
I took care of you after Mom died!

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:36.032
It's your fault she died.

01:13:36.065 --> 01:13:37.536
I didn't wanna do it, but you made me!

01:13:37.569 --> 01:13:38.880
You brought me into this!

01:13:38.913 --> 01:13:40.224
Into what?

01:13:40.257 --> 01:13:42.208
You've lost it, man!

01:13:42.241 --> 01:13:43.840
Bree!

01:13:43.873 --> 01:13:47.008
Bree get out here, I know you're in here.

01:13:47.042 --> 01:13:49.632
Bree!

01:14:03.171 --> 01:14:07.490
Why?

01:14:07.522 --> 01:14:09.378
You know why.

01:14:09.411 --> 01:14:13.987
'Cause I was never good enough for you.

01:14:14.019 --> 01:14:17.219
Why him?

01:14:19.076 --> 01:14:22.915
Because he sees me.

01:14:22.947 --> 01:14:26.595
You don't see anything, Aiden.

01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:28.803
I mean, you used to be so full of life,

01:14:28.836 --> 01:14:33.571
but it's been replaced by this darkness.

01:14:33.604 --> 01:14:36.708
And there's this part of you that,

01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:39.876
that's missing.

01:14:39.909 --> 01:14:42.980
The part of you that loved.

01:14:43.013 --> 01:14:46.084
It's gone.

01:14:46.117 --> 01:14:49.540
But I still have the part that hurts.

01:14:52.134 --> 01:14:54.532
And the part that hates.

01:14:54.565 --> 01:14:56.101
Why have you become like this?

01:14:56.133 --> 01:14:57.700
You did this to me.

01:14:57.734 --> 01:15:00.037
I've tried our whole lives
to protect you from yourself.

01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:01.285
Drugs, jail.

01:15:01.318 --> 01:15:02.629
But your demons won't let you go,

01:15:02.662 --> 01:15:04.453
and now they're trying to take me with you.

01:15:11.302 --> 01:15:14.534
You're right.

01:15:14.567 --> 01:15:17.222
It's him.

01:15:17.254 --> 01:15:19.942
Who?

01:15:19.975 --> 01:15:22.470
It worked on you.

01:15:22.504 --> 01:15:24.423
You were protected.

01:15:24.455 --> 01:15:27.110
How could I have not seen this the whole time?

01:15:27.144 --> 01:15:29.799
Seen what?

01:15:29.832 --> 01:15:31.111
He can't get to you.

01:15:31.144 --> 01:15:33.127
So he's pulling you into his darkness

01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:35.271
through me.

01:15:35.304 --> 01:15:37.031
Who?

01:15:37.064 --> 01:15:40.136
I hope you never know, Aiden.

01:15:40.168 --> 01:15:43.175
I hope you never know.

01:15:43.209 --> 01:15:44.999
I go...

01:15:45.033 --> 01:15:49.064
I gotta go somewhere where
he can't reach you from.

01:15:49.097 --> 01:15:50.216
And I gotta...

01:15:50.248 --> 01:15:54.376
I gotta find a way to stop this.

01:15:54.409 --> 01:15:58.184
I'm sorry.

01:15:58.218 --> 01:16:02.473
Wait.

01:16:02.506 --> 01:16:05.449
I'm sorry.

01:16:22.027 --> 01:16:23.530
Cody?

01:16:23.563 --> 01:16:26.090
Cody, it's me, Aiden.

01:16:28.748 --> 01:16:29.803
Aiden?

01:16:29.835 --> 01:16:30.890
Yeah!

01:16:30.923 --> 01:16:32.650
Cody, Cody, it's me, it's me.

01:16:32.684 --> 01:16:34.155
Oh, my God.

01:16:34.188 --> 01:16:35.755
Oh, my God.

01:16:35.787 --> 01:16:37.642
What are you doing here?

01:16:37.676 --> 01:16:39.562
I'm saving you.

01:16:39.596 --> 01:16:40.747
I am so sorry.

01:16:40.779 --> 01:16:42.059
I... I understand it all now.

01:16:42.091 --> 01:16:45.995
You, Mom, the Tormentor.

01:16:46.029 --> 01:16:48.300
Why didn't you protect me, Aiden?

01:16:48.332 --> 01:16:51.659
Like you said you would.

01:16:51.692 --> 01:16:53.740
I'm here now.

01:16:53.772 --> 01:16:55.980
I'm gonna get you out of here.

01:16:56.013 --> 01:16:58.476
It's locked.

01:17:39.151 --> 01:17:40.910
No, no, no!

01:18:02.321 --> 01:18:03.440
Hold on.

01:18:08.177 --> 01:18:09.072
Okay.

01:18:09.105 --> 01:18:10.832
Step away from the ledge.

01:18:19.442 --> 01:18:21.553
It won't break!

01:18:34.578 --> 01:18:37.201
Let's go, let's go, right now!

01:18:45.715 --> 01:18:46.962
Okay, let's go, right now!

01:18:46.996 --> 01:18:48.147
Holy shit, your leg!

01:18:48.179 --> 01:18:52.210
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

01:18:52.244 --> 01:18:56.563
Shit, shit!

01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:10.423
The Tormentor.

01:20:10.456 --> 01:20:12.888
He's been with me this whole time.

01:20:17.048 --> 01:20:19.128
I can't kill my guilt.

01:20:19.161 --> 01:20:22.040
He'll always be with me.

01:21:09.852 --> 01:21:12.347
I promised Mom I'd take care of him,

01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:14.331
but I failed.

01:21:14.364 --> 01:21:16.860
I failed.

01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:26.047
You can't hurt us any more.

01:22:33.057 --> 01:22:35.488
It is too late.

01:22:35.521 --> 01:22:38.784
Get out of my head!

01:22:38.817 --> 01:22:41.601
We're both his now.

01:22:41.633 --> 01:22:42.880
No!

01:22:42.914 --> 01:22:45.664
There's no use for you any more.

01:22:45.698 --> 01:22:48.224
We did what we had to do!

01:22:48.258 --> 01:22:51.361
He was supposed to protect me.

01:22:51.394 --> 01:22:52.257
No!

01:22:52.290 --> 01:22:54.113
He did all he could!

01:22:54.146 --> 01:22:56.033
He kept his word.

01:22:56.066 --> 01:22:58.849
He came back to save me.

01:22:58.883 --> 01:23:02.050
He hasn't saved you yet.

01:23:02.082 --> 01:23:04.738
It doesn't matter.

01:23:04.771 --> 01:23:06.754
I forgive him.

01:23:12.131 --> 01:23:15.010
I just hope he can forgive me.

01:24:04.519 --> 01:24:07.046
Nooo.

01:24:07.078 --> 01:24:09.702
Noooo.

01:25:31.083 --> 01:25:32.042
We got him, bro.

01:25:32.076 --> 01:25:35.819
We got him.

01:25:35.852 --> 01:25:39.339
You saved my ass again, huh?

01:25:39.371 --> 01:25:40.491
No, Cody.

01:25:40.524 --> 01:25:41.419
No.

01:25:41.452 --> 01:25:45.259
This time, you saved mine.

01:25:45.292 --> 01:25:46.059
I'm so sorry.

01:25:46.092 --> 01:25:47.852
No, no, no, no.

01:25:47.884 --> 01:25:49.004
No more guilt.

01:25:49.036 --> 01:25:51.755
No more guilt.

01:25:51.789 --> 01:25:54.956
All our lives I've been trying to protect you.

01:25:54.988 --> 01:25:57.420
You were trying to protect me from him.

01:26:00.525 --> 01:26:02.509
Thank you.

01:26:02.541 --> 01:26:04.013
Don't say "thank you".

01:26:04.045 --> 01:26:08.045
I just, I just wanted to be like you.

01:26:16.046 --> 01:26:19.149
I miss Mom.

01:26:19.183 --> 01:26:21.646
Take me home, Aiden.

01:26:21.678 --> 01:26:23.533
Take me home.

01:26:35.823 --> 01:26:39.598
One, two,

01:26:39.632 --> 01:26:40.814
three.

01:26:44.816 --> 01:26:45.903
Hey.

01:26:45.936 --> 01:26:47.503
Cody, wake up.

01:26:47.536 --> 01:26:49.071
Hey, we did it, we did it!

01:26:49.104 --> 01:26:50.767
We killed the Tormentor, it's over.

01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:53.711
It's over.

01:26:53.745 --> 01:26:55.248
Cody.

01:27:04.721 --> 01:27:06.480
But...

01:27:06.513 --> 01:27:08.560
I'm sorry, Aiden.

01:27:08.594 --> 01:27:12.816
I tried, but the bleeding never stopped.

01:27:12.849 --> 01:27:14.832
He just passed a moment ago.

01:27:19.250 --> 01:27:23.537
We lost Duane, too.

01:27:23.570 --> 01:27:25.874
No.

01:27:25.906 --> 01:27:29.554
Nooo!

01:27:29.586 --> 01:27:32.018
My brother!

01:27:44.755 --> 01:27:46.547
I wish you had a chance to talk to him

01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:50.835
before he passed into the next world.

01:28:00.085 --> 01:28:03.027
I did.

01:28:03.061 --> 01:28:06.388
I did.

01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:09.139
He's with Mom now.

01:28:09.173 --> 01:28:12.564
And they're both safe.

01:28:12.597 --> 01:28:16.468
He made his big brother proud.
