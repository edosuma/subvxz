01:28.200 --> 01:29.466
You wanna rephrase that, baby?

I'm sorry, Harriette,
I‐I‐I just mean

I am expecting
a very important phone call.

Cousin Larry is on the verge
of a very big perversion.

Very big promotion.

about it. It's very hush hush.

‐ People talk in elevators.

01:56.800 --> 02:00.766
‐ I listen.
‐ Cousin, there's an idea.

02:00.800 --> 02:03.600
You should wait in the elevator.
That's where all the news is.

02:05.566 --> 02:06.633
Well, I hope
you get your call soon.

02:06.666 --> 02:08.433

the phone company.

our phone hooked up.

Well, they didn't give me
a raise as such.

Well, no need to be greedy.

05:35.266 --> 05:38.166
After all, you got
that fancy new office.

best if I stayed right here.

writing the hard news.

Hard salami.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.766
They want me to get them lunch.

Well, you still got
that snappy title.

06:58.800 --> 06:59.766
Well, Balki.

07:01.666 --> 07:04.033
My first day
as an investigative reporter

07:04.066 --> 07:06.600
and the only thing I exposed
was some fatty corned beef.

07:08.500 --> 07:11.200
Oh, come on, cousin.
Don't be discouraged.

07:11.233 --> 07:13.500
‐ Your dream is coming true.
‐ Oh!

07:13.533 --> 07:15.500
Come on, you're‐you're a member

07:15.533 --> 07:18.500
of the Investigative Reporting
team.

07:18.533 --> 07:20.666
Don't you think that
Mushmouth and Polevault

07:20.700 --> 07:22.300
started out
where you're starting out?

07:23.666 --> 07:26.333
Marshall and Walpole.

07:26.366 --> 07:29.433
Alright, alright, look,
I read all about them.

07:29.466 --> 07:31.633
I know that they started out
at the bottom

07:31.666 --> 07:34.166
writing little tiny pieces
for the paper.

07:34.200 --> 07:36.566
And then they moved on
to the Features department

07:36.600 --> 07:38.600
and they are writing
bigger stories.

07:38.633 --> 07:41.033
And then, after a few years,
they stumbled

07:41.066 --> 07:44.233
onto that milk scandal
and the rest, as they say

07:44.266 --> 07:45.666
is hysterectomy.

07:50.533 --> 07:52.566
You know, Balki, you're right.

07:54.533 --> 07:55.700
You've shown me
what I have to do.

07:55.733 --> 07:57.400
And not for the first time
either.

08:00.333 --> 08:04.533
Cousin, I'm glad you're seeing
that patience is the key.

08:04.566 --> 08:06.533
What patience?
Patience is for losers.

08:06.566 --> 08:08.433
I don't have time for patience.

08:08.466 --> 08:10.533
What I need
is a sensational story

08:10.566 --> 08:12.066
that will launch me
right to the top.

08:12.100 --> 08:13.766
Just like Marshall and Walpole.

08:13.800 --> 08:17.166
But right now, I'm gonna
get a good night sleep.

08:17.200 --> 08:19.400
I'm gonna get up at 3:30,
go hang out at night court.

08:19.433 --> 08:20.766
Love that show.

happening down there.

Listen, uh, Harriette and I
still don't have our phone yet.

but I'm expecting

08:36.765 --> 08:39.265
a real important phone call from
headquarters, and I told them

08:39.299 --> 08:41.232
they could reach me here,
I hope you guys don't mind

08:41.265 --> 08:43.066
if I kinda hang around
a little while?

08:43.100 --> 08:44.333
‐ Oh, no. Come on in.
‐ No, it's no problem.

08:44.366 --> 08:46.800
‐ Alright.
‐ Alright.

08:46.833 --> 08:49.266
Uh, look, Carl, uh,
I don't mean to seem rude

08:49.300 --> 08:50.433
but, uh, I gotta get
some shut‐eye.

08:50.466 --> 08:51.700
‐ Oh!
‐ I'm exhausted.

08:51.733 --> 08:53.600
‐ Okay. Goodnight.
‐ Goodnight.

‐ So, Carl, how's it going?
‐ Oh, great.

08:56.700 --> 08:59.166
We're this close
to busting a big politician.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.500
But, hey, I can sleep tomorrow.

09:02.133 --> 09:03.433
Let's talk.

09:05.233 --> 09:07.466
Cousin, I‐I thought
you were going to bed.

09:07.500 --> 09:09.333
Oh, suddenly, I feel wide awake.

09:09.366 --> 09:11.166
Guess I'm getting
my second wind.

09:11.200 --> 09:12.700
I'll get the antacid.

09:18.400 --> 09:22.166
So, Carl, uh, you're closing
in on a corrupt politician?

09:22.200 --> 09:24.566
Yeah, I really wanna nail
this guy.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.400
And we're about to spring
a trap for him

09:26.433 --> 09:28.133
and a big mob kingpin.

09:28.166 --> 09:31.166
Cousin, you want,
uh, mint or original formula?

09:32.733 --> 09:36.033
‐ Original formula.
‐ Yeah.

09:36.066 --> 09:38.433
He's been takin' bribes
from the mob for years.

09:38.466 --> 09:40.166
Cousin, uh, you want a spoon

09:40.200 --> 09:41.366
or will you be
chugalugging tonight?

09:44.233 --> 09:46.200
Chugalugging, chugalugging.
Ahem!

09:46.233 --> 09:49.600
So, uh, this politician,
we talking, uh, local, state

09:49.633 --> 09:51.466
federal, appointed, elected?
Did I vote for him?

09:51.500 --> 09:53.233
Did you vote for him?
Nod if I'm getting warm.

09:53.266 --> 09:56.066
Uh, Larry, I really
can't say anymore about it.

09:56.100 --> 09:57.733
This is official
police business.

09:57.766 --> 10:00.033
And I've got to remember,
I'm talking to a member

10:00.066 --> 10:02.233
of the "Chronicle's"
Investigative Reporting team.

10:02.266 --> 10:04.100
I wouldn't wanna see this
on the front page.

Which drip do you
want to talk to?

10:14.300 --> 10:17.333
‐ Carl, it's‐it's for you.
‐ That's my call.

10:17.366 --> 10:19.200
Oh, two points.

10:19.233 --> 10:21.266
Hello. Yeah.

10:21.300 --> 10:23.300
It's going down tonight?

10:23.333 --> 10:26.566
‐ Oh, when?
‐ Oh! "Childproof cap."

10:28.500 --> 10:31.333
Okay, you make sure
that Alderman is there

10:31.366 --> 10:32.766
and I'll bring Carmine.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.800
Right. Uh‐huh.

10:35.833 --> 10:38.233
Okay, no, he doesn't
suspect a thing.

10:38.266 --> 10:40.766
Listen, uh, what's the address
to the restaurant?

10:40.800 --> 10:45.100
Uh‐huh. Uh‐huh.
Okay, got it.

10:45.133 --> 10:47.733
Alright, I'll see you
in 20 minutes. Bye.

10:47.766 --> 10:50.300
Listen, fellas, I really
shouldn't have said all I said

10:50.333 --> 10:51.533
about the case I'm workin' on.

10:51.566 --> 10:54.033
You know, if it ever got out,
I could get in a lot of trouble.

10:54.066 --> 10:55.400
But you two guys are my friends

10:55.433 --> 10:57.800
and I know that you won't say
anything to anybody.

10:57.833 --> 11:01.466
Carl, don't worry because
your secret is safe with us.

11:01.500 --> 11:02.500
Thanks.

11:02.533 --> 11:05.033
If anybody knows
how to keep a secret

11:05.066 --> 11:07.033
we are those people.

11:07.066 --> 11:09.466
‐ Thank you.
‐ Once again, Carl, don't worry.

11:09.500 --> 11:10.333
Alright.

11:10.366 --> 11:12.766
Because your secret
is safe with us.

11:12.800 --> 11:14.400
Gee, thanks.

11:16.800 --> 11:18.500
What secret is he talking about?

11:20.566 --> 11:24.166
I think Carl is going
to make a big bust.

11:24.200 --> 11:27.133
That's the secret?
Carl is interested in sculpting?

11:28.800 --> 11:30.533
Not that kind of bust.

11:30.566 --> 11:31.733
No.

11:33.633 --> 11:36.633
A bust means Carl is going
to arrest a crooked politician

11:36.666 --> 11:39.100
who is involved
with organized crime.

11:39.133 --> 11:41.700
This is the story
I'm looking for.

11:41.733 --> 11:44.166
All I have to do is rub
a pencil across this pad.

11:44.200 --> 11:45.600
Then I can make out
the impression and find out

11:45.633 --> 11:47.700
where the arrest
is going to happen.

11:47.733 --> 11:50.166
Cousin, cousin,
why would you want to do that?

11:50.200 --> 11:51.666
Because I am going
to put this story

11:51.700 --> 11:53.733
on the front page
of "The Chronicle."

11:53.766 --> 11:55.266
On the front page?

11:55.300 --> 11:57.400
Someone might see it.

11:57.433 --> 12:00.200
Not just someone. Everyone.

12:02.133 --> 12:04.166
Cousin, I don't think so.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.533
We promised Carl
that we would keep this a secret

12:06.566 --> 12:08.366
and I intend to keep our word.

12:21.800 --> 12:26.300
Give me the pad...Balki.

12:26.333 --> 12:28.600
I need the address on that pad.

12:28.633 --> 12:30.533
When Carl makes the arrest,
I've got to be there.

12:30.566 --> 12:34.233
This is my big story. This is
my ticket to the big time.

12:34.266 --> 12:37.166
Well, in this case,
you don't have a ticket to ride.

12:39.433 --> 12:41.600
Cousin, Carl told us
to keep this a secret

12:41.633 --> 12:43.700
and I intend to do it.

12:43.733 --> 12:47.433
Oh, hey, hey, hey, I don't
have a problem with that.

12:47.466 --> 12:50.600
You keep it a secret,
but give me the pad.

12:57.533 --> 12:59.733
Cousin, if you build a career
by betraying a friend

12:59.766 --> 13:01.433
you'll hate yourself.

13:01.466 --> 13:03.100
I'd get over it.

13:09.800 --> 13:12.266
Stand back..

13:12.300 --> 13:14.766
...or I'll sweep you
into tomorrow.

13:17.766 --> 13:21.100
Balki, give me that pad.

13:23.633 --> 13:26.033
No, cousin. This is wrong.

13:26.066 --> 13:28.433
Carl don't want us
to have this information.

13:28.466 --> 13:30.766
Oh, oh, oh!

13:30.800 --> 13:33.466
So that's what's bothering you.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.700
Yes.

13:35.733 --> 13:38.266
You think Carl doesn't want us
to have that information.

13:38.300 --> 13:40.233
‐ That is correct.
‐ But Balki, no.

13:40.266 --> 13:43.133
That is not correct.
The truth, the truth is..

13:43.166 --> 13:45.266
The truth..

13:45.300 --> 13:48.366
...is that Carl wants me
to have that address.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.266
You see this is the way
information is passed

13:50.300 --> 13:53.200
from undercover cops
to investigative reporters.

13:55.433 --> 13:58.266
But if, if Carl wanted you
to have this information

13:58.300 --> 14:00.266
why he didn't just come out
and say it?

14:00.300 --> 14:02.200
‐ Well, he couldn't do that.
‐ No?

14:02.233 --> 14:05.133
No.
He'd get into trouble.

14:05.166 --> 14:06.666
We wouldn't want that
to happen now, would we?

14:06.700 --> 14:07.766
‐ No.
‐ 'No.'

14:07.800 --> 14:09.633
‐ 'No.'
‐ No.

14:09.666 --> 14:12.333
But you said that Carl wanted
you to have this address.

14:12.366 --> 14:14.266
He does want me
to have that address.

14:14.300 --> 14:16.233
‐ He does.
‐ But he can't give it to me.

14:16.266 --> 14:17.200
‐ He can't?
‐ No.

14:17.233 --> 14:19.400
That's why he told me
to keep it a secret.

14:19.433 --> 14:21.133
Balki, think about it.

14:24.333 --> 14:26.166
If Carl didn't want me
to put it in the paper

14:26.200 --> 14:28.200
he wouldn't have told me
to keep it a secret.

14:31.366 --> 14:33.533
Wait a minute.

14:33.566 --> 14:38.266
Are you, are you saying
that Carl gave us a secret

14:38.300 --> 14:41.300
and told us to keep
that secret a secret

14:41.333 --> 14:44.166
but that‐that really
wasn't what he wanted?

14:44.200 --> 14:46.133
What he really wanted
was for you

14:46.166 --> 14:47.733
to put that secret
on the front page

14:47.766 --> 14:51.800
of the newspaper so that
everyone can know this secret

14:51.833 --> 14:54.000
that we are supposed
to be keeping a secret?

14:57.500 --> 15:00.433
Exactly.

15:00.466 --> 15:02.500
‐ Exactly what?
‐ Exactly what you just said.

15:02.533 --> 15:04.266
I don't know what I just said.

15:05.700 --> 15:08.166
All I know is
you had the wind problem.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.600
I went into the kitchen
to get the antacid.

15:10.633 --> 15:12.500
I couldn't get
the top of it off‐‐

15:12.533 --> 15:15.233
Balki, Balki, Balki,
Balki, Balki.

15:15.266 --> 15:19.200
Look, this is all
very, very simple.

15:19.233 --> 15:21.433
Carl told us to keep a secret

15:21.466 --> 15:23.266
hoping we would make it public.

15:23.300 --> 15:25.500
On the other hand, if Carl
had told us to make it public

15:25.533 --> 15:28.466
we would be honor‐bound
to keep it a secret.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.666
Because Carl knows a secret
being a secret

15:30.700 --> 15:32.533
is the only thing
worth making public.

15:32.566 --> 15:34.300
Otherwise, why call it a secret?

15:40.533 --> 15:42.133
Take the pad.

15:44.500 --> 15:46.266
I've got a headache.

15:51.666 --> 15:53.266
[panting]

15:55.766 --> 15:59.666
Nothing. There is nothing.
This always works in the movies.

15:59.700 --> 16:01.666
Balki, how am I gonna find out
where Carl's making the arrest?

16:03.366 --> 16:06.200
He gave us a secret..

16:06.233 --> 16:08.266
...he wanted to keep a secret.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.800
Balki, why can't I
ever get a break?

16:10.833 --> 16:12.600
Oh, don't worry, cousin.

16:12.633 --> 16:17.733
It's the Side Show Restaurant,
6818 West Fullerton.

16:17.766 --> 16:21.133
I‐I‐I glanced at the pad
while he was writing it down.

16:21.166 --> 16:24.133
Balki, I'll never forget you
for this.

16:24.166 --> 16:26.100
We've got ten minutes
to get there.

16:27.433 --> 16:29.433
He, and‐and..

16:29.466 --> 16:32.166
I‐if you put on the front page
of the newspaper

16:32.200 --> 16:34.200
then everyone would know
the secret

16:34.233 --> 16:35.766
that we are supposed
to be keeping a secret.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.533
‐ Because he said to us that‐‐
‐ Let's go.

16:48.100 --> 16:49.500
Hey, Alderman, I'm glad
you could make it.

16:49.533 --> 16:52.166
‐ Hey.
‐ Adios.

16:52.200 --> 16:53.700
Well, there was no way
I was gonna miss

16:53.733 --> 16:55.466
Sergeant Bergetti's
surprise party.

16:55.500 --> 16:58.566
After all, Carmine is one
of the best cops on the force.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.333
So, uh, how is Carl
gonna get him here

17:00.366 --> 17:01.733
without, uh,
spoiling the surprise?

17:01.766 --> 17:03.533
How do you get a cop
to go anywhere?

17:03.566 --> 17:06.400
You promise him
a free meal, right?

17:06.433 --> 17:08.333
Alright, alright,
but one question.

17:08.366 --> 17:10.333
With all the cops in here,
who's minding the city?

17:10.366 --> 17:12.099
[all laughing]

17:19.532 --> 17:21.165
Look at this place.

17:21.200 --> 17:23.066
It's crawling with criminals.

17:24.766 --> 17:26.433
They look like nice people
to me.

17:26.465 --> 17:28.700
Oh, Balki, Balki, Balki.

17:30.466 --> 17:32.766
When you've been on the street
as long as I have

17:32.800 --> 17:36.300
there are some things
you just know.

17:36.333 --> 17:38.466
I have been on the street
as long as you have.

17:38.500 --> 17:40.333
We left the house
at the same time.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.400
Just stick close to me.

17:48.433 --> 17:51.000
Try not to draw attention
to yourself.

17:59.333 --> 18:00.566
Planter.

18:04.566 --> 18:06.000
[rattling]

18:08.833 --> 18:10.333
Loose tile. Careful.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.633
Oh, my Lord.

18:22.666 --> 18:26.233
Alderman Zittrell is sitting
at a table in the corner.

18:26.266 --> 18:27.800
'He must be
the crooked politician'

18:27.833 --> 18:29.633
Carl is going to arrest.

18:31.100 --> 18:33.100
Oh, my Lord!

18:33.133 --> 18:34.733
That's the chief of police
with him.

18:34.766 --> 18:36.466
He must be a crook too.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.733
What a story!

18:38.766 --> 18:39.766
I've got to know
what they're talking about.

18:39.800 --> 18:42.300
Balki..

18:42.333 --> 18:45.600
...I am going to try
to tape their conversation.

18:45.633 --> 18:48.066
Wait here.

18:48.100 --> 18:49.700
Could I have a Shirley Temple
over here?

18:54.700 --> 18:58.233
Wait here.
Don't speak.

18:58.266 --> 19:00.000
Don't move.

19:05.466 --> 19:07.266
Let me freshen that for you.

19:15.766 --> 19:17.700
‐ There you are.
‐ Thank you.

19:26.066 --> 19:28.133
I can't believe it.

19:28.166 --> 19:30.733
I am blowing the lid off
the biggest story in town.

19:30.766 --> 19:32.733
If Carl hadn't let this slip,
I'd still be getting lunch

19:32.766 --> 19:34.633
for those bozos,
Marshall and Walpole.

19:36.433 --> 19:39.333
Let it slip? What?

19:39.366 --> 19:42.133
You told me that Carl wanted us
to have this information.

19:42.166 --> 19:44.666
No, he did, uh,
let it slip is a generic term

19:44.700 --> 19:46.500
which can be used to denote
one who wants to convey inform‐‐

19:46.533 --> 19:49.666
Cousin, cut the Bullwinkle!

19:53.100 --> 19:56.433
Okay. I lied. Big deal.

19:56.466 --> 19:58.166
I'm trying to build
a career here.

19:58.200 --> 20:00.433
If you have a problem
with that..

20:00.466 --> 20:02.366
...go home.

20:05.133 --> 20:06.600
I will.

20:08.466 --> 20:12.100
But first, I'm going
to get that tape recorder.

20:14.333 --> 20:17.433
Balki, you are interfering
with the freedom of the press.

20:17.466 --> 20:18.566
Oh, phoo!

20:23.200 --> 20:24.166
Cousin.

20:27.133 --> 20:28.100
Balki.

20:31.500 --> 20:33.033
Cousin, please.

20:36.333 --> 20:37.300
(both)
Hi!

20:38.800 --> 20:40.766
‐ What do you want?
‐ How about your bread?

20:40.800 --> 20:41.700
The bread's fine.

20:41.733 --> 20:43.633
Well, then,
you'll be wanting some more.

20:52.266 --> 20:53.766
Loose tile, careful.

20:59.400 --> 21:01.033
‐ Are you happy?
‐ Well..

21:01.066 --> 21:02.466
You could have gotten us killed.

21:06.700 --> 21:08.766
(chief of police on recorder)
'Don't worry,
everything's all set.'

21:08.800 --> 21:11.466
'As soon as Carl comes
in that door with Carmine'

21:11.500 --> 21:13.600
'boom, we'll let him have it.'

21:13.633 --> 21:16.366
(Alderman on recorder)
'I can't wait to see his face.
He is going to die when‐‐'

21:17.833 --> 21:19.500
(Balki and Larry on recorder)
'Hi.'

21:22.733 --> 21:25.533
Balki, Alderman Zittrell
is planning to murder Carl.

21:25.566 --> 21:27.033
We've got to get out of here
and warn him.

21:28.300 --> 21:29.733
Quiet down, everybody,
they're comin'.

21:29.766 --> 21:32.233
Okay, this is it.

21:32.266 --> 21:35.066
‐ Now when I give the signal.
‐ Balki, we've got to stop him.

21:35.100 --> 21:36.500
[muffled screaming]

21:43.566 --> 21:46.666
Surprise!

21:46.700 --> 21:48.333
Well, you got that right.

22:01.533 --> 22:04.566
Carl, I am so sorry
about all the embarrassment‐‐

22:04.600 --> 22:06.766
Hey, Larry,
don't worry about it.

22:06.800 --> 22:09.033
You're already
a legend downtown.

22:09.066 --> 22:11.166
They'll be laughing about you
for years.

22:12.333 --> 22:14.366
Oh, cousin, isn't that nice?

22:14.400 --> 22:16.466
And you thought
you made a fool of yourself.

22:18.333 --> 22:20.266
Well, I better get downstairs.

22:20.300 --> 22:22.100
Harriette waits up for me.

22:22.133 --> 22:23.766
She likes to dust me
for fingerprints.

22:25.700 --> 22:27.466
Why? Doesn't she trust you
when you work undercover?

22:27.500 --> 22:30.066
Oh, no, no, no.
It's nothing like that.

22:30.100 --> 22:33.066
It's just a little thing
that we do.

22:40.700 --> 22:45.066
Boy, some
investigative reporter.

22:45.100 --> 22:47.100
I blew the lid off
a surprise party.

22:48.833 --> 22:51.433
Oh, come on, cousin.
Don't be down on yourself.

22:51.466 --> 22:53.633
You're a good writer
and a hard worker.

22:53.666 --> 22:56.133
And someday,
you're gonna be just as famous

22:56.166 --> 22:58.033
as Maytag and Whirlpool.

22:59.666 --> 23:00.700
You really think
I'm a good writer?

23:00.733 --> 23:02.566
Well, of course, I do.

23:02.600 --> 23:04.066
Don't be ridiculous.

23:05.533 --> 23:07.600
Well, maybe you're right.

23:07.633 --> 23:10.800
If I just hang in there,
work hard..

23:10.833 --> 23:11.800
...my time will come.

23:11.833 --> 23:13.533
Of course, it will.

23:13.566 --> 23:16.400
Remember, cousin,
patience is a virgin.

23:26.800 --> 23:28.300
[theme music]
