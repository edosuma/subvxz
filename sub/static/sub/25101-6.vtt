01:03:23.930 --> 01:03:26.330
Yeah.
The first one was, you know,

01:03:26.330 --> 01:03:27.960
you've won
a karaoke competition,

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:29.460
and you sang a karaoke song,

01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:30.900
and now you're
singing your song.

01:04:11.530 --> 01:04:14.100

that's been the low

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:16.030
and the high point getting to

01:04:16.031 --> 01:04:17.960
where you've been today?

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:21.130
The low is I've been out

01:04:21.131 --> 01:04:24.300
on my own since I was 18,

01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:26.630

enough money to eat,

01:04:32.830 --> 01:04:35.115
and it just makes moments

01:04:35.116 --> 01:04:37.400
like this

01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:38.960
that much better.

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:40.430
Okay.

01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:41.830

if we would have left it

I would have given you a no,

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:56.060
but now I'm gonna kick this
voting off with your first yes,

01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:57.000

this is gonna go.

give you some advice.

01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:09.430
I think at this point
you're still too closed,

01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:12.360
'cause America's watching, and
it's not just about your song.

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:14.095
It's about you.

01:05:14.096 --> 01:05:15.830
So at this point I'm saying no.

01:05:15.830 --> 01:05:17.500
You need to open up
and come back.

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:18.930
What?
He just did.

01:05:18.930 --> 01:05:20.360
No, he didn't.
He just sung a song

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:21.700
about leaving a girl behind.

01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:23.360

dragging it out of him.

can be intimidating,

01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:29.460

01:05:29.461 --> 01:05:30.960

a really good song.
