00:03.602 --> 00:07.227

00:07.563 --> 00:10.547
_

00:10.624 --> 00:14.375
_

00:14.914 --> 00:18.619
_

00:25.984 --> 00:28.552
Henry, are you sure about this?

00:28.739 --> 00:31.865
I was hoping after high school,
you'd think about college.

00:31.890 --> 00:34.061
I know. But college
isn't going anywhere.

00:34.086 --> 00:36.926
I just... I need to do this.

00:37.028 --> 00:38.761
Operation Cobra is over.

00:38.863 --> 00:40.663
We did it. We have our happy endings.

00:40.688 --> 00:42.198
So then why leave?

00:42.300 --> 00:43.453
Because I'm still the Author.

00:43.478 --> 00:46.002
I've been writing
everyone else's stories.

00:46.104 --> 00:48.338
I need to figure out what my story is.

00:48.363 --> 00:51.708
And... it's not here.

00:51.810 --> 00:53.376
Then where do you think it is?

00:53.478 --> 00:54.477
I don't know.

00:54.579 --> 00:56.846
But when I finished the book,

00:56.948 --> 00:58.431
I returned it to the Sorcerer's mansion.

00:58.456 --> 00:59.882
And you know what I found?

00:59.985 --> 01:01.784
Hundreds of other books.

01:01.886 --> 01:04.554
With the stories I thought
I knew, but told differently.

01:04.656 --> 01:06.338
Like, you know how
there's a French Snow White

01:06.363 --> 01:07.957
and an Italian one...

01:08.059 --> 01:09.826
There's endless possibilities.

01:09.928 --> 01:13.796
And what does that have to do with you?

01:13.898 --> 01:16.299
I'm not in any of them.

01:16.401 --> 01:19.469
I'm the only me.

01:19.571 --> 01:22.205
It's time I figure out where I belong.

01:46.498 --> 01:48.731
Henry, if that's the only bean you have,

01:48.833 --> 01:49.900
getting back here is...

01:50.027 --> 01:51.393
Will be an adventure.

01:51.495 --> 01:54.095
That's where I'm going.

01:54.197 --> 01:55.830
I love you, Mom.

01:58.368 --> 02:00.335
I love you too.

02:11.349 --> 02:15.761
_

02:58.595 --> 03:00.727
Cinderella?

03:17.915 --> 03:21.336
_

04:07.287 --> 04:09.841
_

04:20.043 --> 04:21.843
Uh, hello?

04:21.911 --> 04:24.746
Hi. Are you Henry Mills?

04:25.647 --> 04:27.350
Yeah. Who are you?

04:27.584 --> 04:28.771
My name's Lucy.

04:28.796 --> 04:29.829
I'm your daughter.

04:32.889 --> 04:35.323
Is this some kind of a joke?
Kid, I don't have a daughter.

04:35.392 --> 04:38.293
Oh, that's just the curse.
It changed all your memories.

04:38.777 --> 04:40.462
- A curse, huh?
- Huh...

04:40.530 --> 04:42.511
I kind of expected my favorite writer

04:42.536 --> 04:43.998
to have a little more...

04:44.519 --> 04:46.201
success.

04:46.303 --> 04:47.502
This place is a dump.

04:47.571 --> 04:49.204
You know, I didn't exactly
write "Harry Potter"...

04:49.306 --> 04:51.206
Or anything since that one book...

04:51.274 --> 04:54.075
"Poetic opening line goes here."

04:54.177 --> 04:55.710
You got some work to do.

04:55.812 --> 04:58.146
Not all stories come easy.
Sophomore albums are hard.

04:58.248 --> 04:59.615
And actually, this is
none of your business.

04:59.640 --> 05:01.983
What are you, some kind
of stalkery super fan?

05:02.085 --> 05:04.853
- No, I'm your dau...
- Daughter. Right.

05:04.955 --> 05:05.987
Wrong.

05:06.056 --> 05:08.189
Unh-unh, it's like your book.

05:08.291 --> 05:10.558
You just don't remember
'cause you're cursed.

05:10.627 --> 05:12.527
This is why you're not writing now.

05:12.596 --> 05:15.563
It's because you're not
living your own story.

05:15.917 --> 05:18.900
Come with me to my
neighborhood, Hyperion Heights.

05:19.002 --> 05:20.034
Hyperion Heights?

05:20.103 --> 05:21.936
- It's like your Storybrooke.
- No, it's not.

05:22.005 --> 05:23.771
It's a real neighborhood in Seattle.

05:23.840 --> 05:25.240
A real city with real people.

05:25.342 --> 05:27.475
And living with them... your family.

05:27.577 --> 05:30.044
And the other cursed
fairy-tale characters.

05:30.113 --> 05:31.024
Come with me.

05:31.049 --> 05:32.614
You can meet your true
love and break the curse...

05:32.682 --> 05:34.172
My true love?

05:34.211 --> 05:35.450
My mom.

05:35.552 --> 05:37.252
- Cinderella.
- Mm.

05:37.320 --> 05:38.820
You met her in the
last chapter, remember?

05:38.922 --> 05:40.622
Kid, none of that was real.

05:40.724 --> 05:42.056
Snow White isn't my grandma.

05:42.125 --> 05:43.412
My shrink isn't Jiminy Cricket.

05:43.437 --> 05:44.759
I never flew with Peter Pan

05:44.828 --> 05:46.728
and I never crashed into
Cinderella's carriage.

05:46.796 --> 05:49.597
No, it's true. You returned
all the happy endings.

05:49.666 --> 05:52.867
And now my mom and all the
others need you to do it again.

05:52.936 --> 05:55.036
The curse put most people
in Hyperion Heights, but...

05:55.105 --> 05:56.437
I hear that's an
up-and-coming neighborhood.

05:56.506 --> 05:58.052
Doesn't really sound like a curse to me.

05:58.077 --> 05:59.340
It is!

05:59.409 --> 06:01.843
It's up-and-coming
because my step-grandma,

06:01.945 --> 06:03.244
Cinderella's step-mom,

06:03.313 --> 06:05.914
is trying to bring
people from this world in,

06:05.982 --> 06:08.416
so all the fairy-tale
characters move out.

06:08.830 --> 06:11.019
Move away. Get separated.

06:11.393 --> 06:13.791
Just like you lost Cinderella,

06:13.823 --> 06:16.824
everyone will lose each other...

06:16.893 --> 06:18.893
forever.

06:18.962 --> 06:21.095
Sad story, kid.

06:21.164 --> 06:22.864
But that's all it is. Now
come on, I got stuff to do.

06:22.933 --> 06:24.065
But my mom! She needs...

06:24.167 --> 06:25.833
Look kid, I'm sorry about your mom.

06:25.902 --> 06:27.802
But I'm not some magic
fairy-tale character

06:27.871 --> 06:29.830
who can swoop in and change her life.

06:30.221 --> 06:32.205
She's got to do what we all do.

06:34.277 --> 06:36.945
She's got to save herself.

06:59.369 --> 07:01.436
You're late.

07:01.504 --> 07:02.437
Again.

07:02.505 --> 07:03.705
I ran here as fast as I could,

07:03.773 --> 07:05.840
but my... but my roommate took
too long in the bathroom...

07:05.942 --> 07:07.141
and then the door got stuck...

07:07.210 --> 07:08.810
I don't give a crap!

07:08.912 --> 07:10.164
I'm paying you for 39 hours...

07:11.634 --> 07:12.914
Really, Carl?

07:12.983 --> 07:14.282
That's coming out of your paycheck.

07:14.428 --> 07:15.994
Hey, Louie, lay off.

07:16.580 --> 07:17.696
It's just chicken.

07:17.721 --> 07:19.354
You don't need to be a jerk about it.

07:22.300 --> 07:23.717
Apologize.

07:24.798 --> 07:26.798
Now! Or get out.

07:28.365 --> 07:31.032
I can't, because it's true.

07:31.101 --> 07:32.867
You're a jerk.

07:32.969 --> 07:35.103
You think you know me so well, huh?

07:35.488 --> 07:36.971
I know you.

07:37.073 --> 07:38.862
I've known a million yous.

07:38.887 --> 07:40.942
Single mom. Kid to take care of.

07:41.011 --> 07:43.478
No real skills other than that temper.

07:43.777 --> 07:45.112
You need this job.

07:45.137 --> 07:47.548
This is the best you
can do, and you know it.

07:47.617 --> 07:49.284
So, yeah,

07:49.386 --> 07:50.818
you're gonna apologize.

07:51.059 --> 07:52.642
Right?

07:57.017 --> 07:58.305
Never.

08:04.501 --> 08:06.734
Uh, Cinderella? Are you okay?

08:06.803 --> 08:08.836
Come on. Come on, wake up. Come on.

08:08.905 --> 08:10.794
You okay?

08:10.819 --> 08:12.273
I think so.

08:12.375 --> 08:14.942
The hyacinths broke my fall.

08:15.045 --> 08:17.011
Your lucky flower.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.280
And you broke my carriage.

08:19.382 --> 08:21.149
And scared off Felipe.

08:21.251 --> 08:22.617
Felipe?

08:22.686 --> 08:24.619
My s...

08:24.688 --> 08:25.820
My steed.

08:25.922 --> 08:28.823
It's, uh, one with an actual head,

08:28.925 --> 08:31.859
unlike your headless-horse contraption.

08:31.928 --> 08:33.361
Motorcycle.

08:33.429 --> 08:35.096
What the hell were you
doing there, anyway?

08:35.164 --> 08:36.397
Uh, heading home,

08:36.466 --> 08:39.433
and, well, time is
kind of of the essence.

08:39.501 --> 08:41.336
Is your home going somewhere?

08:41.438 --> 08:42.870
No, but the way home is.

08:42.972 --> 08:44.339
I'm from another realm.

08:44.441 --> 08:46.174
Portals and, well,
they don't stay open...

08:46.242 --> 08:48.976
Enough. I have somewhere to be too.

08:49.045 --> 08:51.612
And I am not walking the rest
of the way in glass slippers.

08:51.715 --> 08:54.315
Right, the slippers. Your story...

08:54.417 --> 08:55.650
My story?

08:55.752 --> 08:57.251
Well, yeah, sure. Everyone knows it.

08:57.354 --> 08:59.253
You know, from the books.
And there was the cartoon.

08:59.356 --> 09:00.221
Who are you?

09:00.246 --> 09:01.538
That doesn't really matter right now,

09:01.563 --> 09:03.791
because it's your story we got to fix.

09:04.866 --> 09:07.562
Don't you have a prince to find?

09:07.741 --> 09:08.973
Yeah.

09:08.998 --> 09:10.198
I do.

09:10.577 --> 09:13.267
Well, maybe I can give you a ride.

09:13.987 --> 09:15.893
You want me to get on that thing?

09:16.290 --> 09:18.336
Well, yeah. You're gonna love it.

09:35.325 --> 09:37.759
"If you want to see your
laptop again, meet me at Roni's.

09:37.827 --> 09:40.628
Take a left at the Troll
under the Aurora Bridge."

09:54.511 --> 09:56.444
Really?

10:38.188 --> 10:40.922
Uh... hello?

11:00.777 --> 11:04.512
Uh, excuse me? Is this Roni's?

11:05.986 --> 11:07.915
I sure hope so.

11:08.017 --> 11:10.985
Or else I put the wrong sign out front.

11:11.087 --> 11:13.254
I'm Roni.

11:13.356 --> 11:15.690
What can I get ya?

11:19.512 --> 11:21.446
It's your lucky day, kid.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.714
Whole bar's half off till midnight.

11:23.750 --> 11:26.382
Midnight, huh? Then what?
Place turns into a pumpkin?

11:26.686 --> 11:29.487
More like a juice bar,

11:29.556 --> 11:33.810
or... whatever the bitch
who bought us out drinks.

11:34.060 --> 11:35.316
You're selling, huh?

11:35.341 --> 11:37.128
Well, neighborhood's changing.

11:37.761 --> 11:41.429
And not by choice. By Belfrey.

11:41.574 --> 11:42.867
By what-frey?

11:42.936 --> 11:45.309
Victoria Belfrey?

11:46.168 --> 11:49.540
She's buying up everything.
Bringing folks in.

11:49.846 --> 11:51.252
This used to be...

11:51.277 --> 11:52.810
used to be a community here.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.412
Used to be nice.

11:54.514 --> 11:57.682
Now... everyone's scattering.

11:57.784 --> 11:59.183
Mm.

11:59.208 --> 12:01.341
Can't fight the power, right?

12:01.454 --> 12:03.807
Might as well take the money.

12:05.235 --> 12:07.212
You don't exactly look

12:07.237 --> 12:08.926
like you're having a banner day either.

12:09.028 --> 12:10.495
Been interesting, that's for sure.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.562
What gives?

12:11.631 --> 12:13.464
Imagine if I walked through that door

12:13.620 --> 12:15.445
and told you that I was your son.

12:17.547 --> 12:20.271
That would be a kicker.

12:21.080 --> 12:23.641
It's pretty simple. You
turn here to give it gas.

12:23.710 --> 12:26.744
Squeeze here for the
breaks to slow it down.

12:26.922 --> 12:28.321
Squeeze here to shift gears.

12:28.346 --> 12:29.480
A lot of squeezing.

12:29.944 --> 12:31.110
Yeah.

12:31.135 --> 12:32.550
Here... how about you
hop on, I can show you.

12:32.652 --> 12:34.188
All you have to do is hold on tight.

12:34.828 --> 12:37.530
Well, I suppose there are
worse ways of getting to a ball

12:37.555 --> 12:39.359
than getting escorted by a handsome man

12:39.384 --> 12:41.918
in a tiny smoke-breathing carriage.

12:42.020 --> 12:43.786
- Motorcycle.
- Ahh.

12:44.442 --> 12:45.565
Did you say handsome?

12:45.590 --> 12:47.423
Would you show me the
gas and breaks again?

12:47.525 --> 12:48.524
Yeah.

12:48.610 --> 12:50.215
Mm-hmm.

12:50.240 --> 12:51.867
See? Simple.

12:52.097 --> 12:54.778
- Oh, one more thing.
- Yeah?

12:54.857 --> 12:57.091
My story... how does it end?

12:57.160 --> 13:01.062
Do the Prince and I just dance
and live happily ever after?

13:01.700 --> 13:03.698
There's usually a
complication before that.

13:03.766 --> 13:05.533
He has to find you.

13:05.602 --> 13:07.068
How does he do that?

13:07.370 --> 13:09.571
In most versions, you
leave him a sign...

13:09.596 --> 13:10.494
The glass slipper...

13:10.519 --> 13:12.617
Which he uses to find
the girl who fits it.

13:12.642 --> 13:14.642
- Wha...
- That is ridiculous.

13:14.788 --> 13:17.255
Do you know how many girls
have the same size foot as me?

13:17.280 --> 13:18.539
- Yeah.
- Mm.

13:18.564 --> 13:20.281
A plot hole. For sure.

13:20.383 --> 13:23.517
And, uh, I don't believe in signs.

13:23.620 --> 13:24.885
Well, that's how it goes.

13:24.954 --> 13:26.320
Usually.

13:26.389 --> 13:29.390
Well, maybe it could use a twist?

13:35.074 --> 13:37.298
Thanks for the lesson.

13:51.258 --> 13:52.647
Whoa, whoa!

13:52.969 --> 13:54.821
What're you doing home so early?

13:55.785 --> 13:57.785
I quit.

13:58.297 --> 13:59.353
What?

13:59.455 --> 14:01.652
You know, Louie, he's...

14:01.677 --> 14:02.923
Yeah, I know what Louie is.

14:03.026 --> 14:04.425
He's what you grin and bear

14:04.450 --> 14:07.194
so that the singles in the
rent jar don't get lonely.

14:07.296 --> 14:09.330
I'll figure something out.

14:09.399 --> 14:11.011
What's your step-mom gonna say?

14:11.036 --> 14:12.083
You know, she wasn't thrilled

14:12.108 --> 14:13.868
to let you have custody
of Lucy with a job.

14:13.970 --> 14:15.202
So now...

14:15.227 --> 14:18.061
She's not gonna say a thing,
because she is never gonna know.

14:18.511 --> 14:19.410
Here.

14:19.435 --> 14:21.175
Speaking of that uptight crone,

14:21.244 --> 14:22.843
it's time for Lucy to go to her.

14:22.945 --> 14:24.412
- She almost ready?
- Don't know.

14:24.480 --> 14:25.880
Door's been closed all morning.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.715
If she's still asleep...

14:27.817 --> 14:29.817
Her grandma will kill me if she's late!

14:29.886 --> 14:31.252
Hey!

14:31.741 --> 14:33.154
Lucy?

14:37.493 --> 14:38.859
Hey!

14:38.961 --> 14:40.795
Oh, no!

14:40.897 --> 14:43.097
I'm gonna kill her!

14:44.901 --> 14:47.176
My step-mother's gonna
kill the both of us.

15:03.052 --> 15:04.418
She's coming up!

15:04.520 --> 15:05.519
Come on, people, look alive!

15:05.621 --> 15:06.554
You, clean that up!

15:06.656 --> 15:08.078
You, take off that ridiculous tie!

15:08.103 --> 15:11.305
Everybody look busy! And
remember, not eye contact!

15:13.319 --> 15:15.396
- Good morning.
- Is it?

15:15.465 --> 15:17.582
So tell me, how is it that
I have three assistants

15:17.607 --> 15:20.000
and none of them know
where my granddaughter is?

15:20.103 --> 15:22.305
- Why wasn't she at the house?
- I don't know.

15:22.330 --> 15:24.095
I've been trying to get
a hold of Jacinda all day.

15:24.767 --> 15:26.340
Stop trying.

15:26.409 --> 15:28.242
Start succeeding.

15:28.344 --> 15:31.412
Or must I do everything myself?

15:34.751 --> 15:37.852
So your Cinderella's Fairy Godmother.

15:39.922 --> 15:42.323
You're not very impressive
without your wings.

15:42.425 --> 15:44.959
My wings... they're gone!

15:45.027 --> 15:47.428
I cut them off. While you were sleeping.

15:47.842 --> 15:48.963
Surprise.

15:49.740 --> 15:52.333
But why? Why are you doing this?

15:52.435 --> 15:55.202
Consider it a "teaching moment"

15:55.304 --> 15:56.504
for my other daughter.

15:56.572 --> 15:58.172
Are you done here, Mother?

15:58.241 --> 16:00.272
I have a ball to get to,
and the Prince won't...

16:00.297 --> 16:01.942
Isn't going anywhere, Drizella.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.611
And if you're going to be a princess,

16:03.713 --> 16:04.945
you need to understand

16:05.014 --> 16:08.382
what real power looks like.

16:10.486 --> 16:12.553
You have her wand. Can I?

16:12.655 --> 16:14.516
Never rely on magic.

16:14.541 --> 16:16.657
Magic isn't power...

16:17.087 --> 16:19.827
because magic can be taken.

16:20.141 --> 16:22.062
But fear...

16:22.165 --> 16:24.665
fear lasts forever.

16:24.767 --> 16:27.001
Of course, Mother. I'm sorry.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.636
As you should be.

16:29.053 --> 16:31.972
I suppose there's no harm in
using this wand just the once.

16:32.041 --> 16:32.943
How does this work?

16:32.968 --> 16:34.208
Something like...

16:34.653 --> 16:36.677
Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo.

16:39.969 --> 16:41.559
I guess that was it.

16:42.718 --> 16:46.887
If Cinderella ever returns,
have her clean that up.

16:55.498 --> 16:56.964
Lucy!

16:57.698 --> 17:00.067
Hey!

17:00.136 --> 17:01.635
- What are you doing?
- Making a wish

17:01.737 --> 17:04.137
before Grandma demolishes
this whole place for condos.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.473
Demolishes what place, baby?

17:06.576 --> 17:08.675
This? It's just a sad and a random lot.

17:08.778 --> 17:11.145
No... this used to be a garden.

17:11.214 --> 17:14.147
- Things used to grow here. They can again.
- Right.

17:14.250 --> 17:17.117
See, I found this quarter right here.

17:17.358 --> 17:19.143
It's a sign.

17:19.321 --> 17:20.887
Things can change.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.789
I don't believe in signs.

17:22.971 --> 17:24.224
Throwing that in there,

17:24.327 --> 17:25.988
it's just a waste of a quarter.

17:26.152 --> 17:27.795
Not if the wish comes true.

17:27.896 --> 17:29.263
Okay.

17:34.070 --> 17:36.303
Uh... still empty.

17:36.405 --> 17:37.538
Give it time.

17:38.188 --> 17:39.450
Okay, now come on.

17:39.475 --> 17:42.042
Got to get you ready for ballet class.

17:42.144 --> 17:44.945
You already got me in enough
trouble with my step-mom today.

17:45.047 --> 17:46.013
Sorry.

17:46.115 --> 17:47.748
Yeah, I know.

17:47.850 --> 17:49.083
Where did you go anyway?

17:49.950 --> 17:51.342
I found my dad.

17:58.318 --> 18:01.146
Oh, hey, Jacinda. How's it going?

18:02.373 --> 18:06.191
Great. Lucy's stealing
computers now so... that's new.

18:06.293 --> 18:08.059
Never a dull moment with that kid.

18:09.072 --> 18:11.329
Speaking of my little felon...

18:11.432 --> 18:13.965
you must be Henry.

18:14.034 --> 18:15.700
I'm so sorry about all this.

18:15.769 --> 18:17.168
I don't know what's gotten into her,

18:17.193 --> 18:19.271
but I promise you,
it won't happen again.

18:22.109 --> 18:23.475
What?

18:23.577 --> 18:25.677
Oh... Oh, oh... no... uh, nothing.

18:25.702 --> 18:28.803
Nothing. I'm just, uh, relieved.

18:29.511 --> 18:31.349
And I was starting to wonder
if I really did have a kid.

18:31.418 --> 18:35.187
But clearly I don't,
because meeting you...

18:35.255 --> 18:36.555
I would definitely remember.

18:36.941 --> 18:39.224
Well, that's a...

18:39.326 --> 18:40.394
Yeah.

18:40.419 --> 18:43.261
Looks like you two kids
need an ice breaker.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.223
On the house.

18:47.067 --> 18:48.400
Cheers.

19:14.261 --> 19:15.901
Oh, frog legs. No...

19:15.926 --> 19:17.696
No, thank you.

19:20.868 --> 19:22.133
Drink?

19:34.214 --> 19:36.448
May I have this dance?

19:36.517 --> 19:38.817
Thanks, but I'm not
really the dancing type.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.352
Yeah, I picked up on that.

19:40.454 --> 19:42.988
Brought your lucky flower... a hyacinth.

19:43.013 --> 19:45.047
I promise not to knock you over again...

19:45.192 --> 19:47.325
It is lovely.

19:49.229 --> 19:51.096
One dance.

19:54.368 --> 19:56.935
If you're here about your
headless horse, it's out back.

19:57.037 --> 19:58.670
Actually...

19:58.739 --> 20:01.506
I'm less concerned with that
than the dagger you stole.

20:01.575 --> 20:02.774
I don't know what you're talking about.

20:02.843 --> 20:04.276
Oh, really? Then what's this?

20:04.344 --> 20:06.177
It has my initials engraved on the hilt.

20:06.246 --> 20:07.512
"H.M." Henry Mills.

20:07.581 --> 20:09.006
Are you crazy?

20:11.422 --> 20:14.490
You didn't come here to fall in
love with the Prince, did you?

20:15.631 --> 20:17.355
No, I didn't.

20:19.927 --> 20:22.011
I came here to kill him.

20:23.030 --> 20:24.696
Why would you do that?

20:25.043 --> 20:27.699
'Cause that "prince"
took everything from me.

20:27.801 --> 20:29.000
"He killed my father,

20:29.069 --> 20:32.437
and I've been locked up
sweeping floors ever since."

20:32.506 --> 20:35.106
You're gonna throw your
life away for revenge?

20:35.208 --> 20:36.975
Once you kill him, they'll kill you.

20:37.044 --> 20:38.843
That's not a happy ending.

20:38.912 --> 20:41.179
There is no happy ending for me.

20:41.281 --> 20:43.315
Maybe things are changing.

20:43.417 --> 20:45.083
Maybe me crashing into your carriage

20:45.185 --> 20:46.477
was a sign you can start over.

20:46.502 --> 20:49.444
I told you, I don't believe in signs.

20:52.029 --> 20:53.778
What if I told you I know a place.

20:53.803 --> 20:55.594
A land where people
start over all the time.

20:55.696 --> 20:58.037
I'm going back tonight.
You can come with me.

20:59.514 --> 21:01.132
Start over.

21:01.201 --> 21:03.268
Find your own story.

21:03.964 --> 21:05.904
Sounds lovely, but...

21:06.006 --> 21:09.027
my father, he meant the world to me.

21:10.110 --> 21:11.843
I just can't let it go.

21:11.945 --> 21:14.145
No, no, no! No, hey, wait!

21:29.730 --> 21:30.962
What did you do?

21:40.654 --> 21:43.512
You should really be more
careful what you drink.

21:45.345 --> 21:47.245
I'm Alice.

21:55.589 --> 21:57.555
I need to see Weaver.

22:00.627 --> 22:01.793
Someone to see you, Weaver.

22:01.895 --> 22:04.929
- What?
- There's someone new in town.

22:05.032 --> 22:06.831
Thought you'd want to know.

22:14.441 --> 22:18.210
So... I take it there's
no father in the picture?

22:21.214 --> 22:24.482
Well, there was this guy,
but it was just a fling.

22:24.714 --> 22:28.809
Not my proudest moment,
but, uh, it gave me Lucy.

22:29.450 --> 22:32.590
And I wouldn't change
that for the world.

22:32.846 --> 22:34.912
As for the rest of my life...

22:34.937 --> 22:37.437
Hm. Not too happy with your story?

22:38.416 --> 22:40.047
What would you change?

22:44.638 --> 22:46.554
Well, every day on my way to work,

22:46.579 --> 22:49.274
I see this island out in the bay.

22:49.376 --> 22:51.476
And I always imagine...

22:51.545 --> 22:55.547
What if Lucy and I had
a little home there?

22:55.649 --> 22:58.950
There's a lighthouse, and gardens,

22:59.019 --> 23:02.082
and it just looks like the kind of place

23:02.107 --> 23:05.108
where people live quiet, happy lives.

23:05.496 --> 23:08.460
I guess it's not much of a story.

23:08.562 --> 23:10.325
I think it sounds perfect.

23:17.571 --> 23:20.438
The bar's yours at midnight, Victoria.

23:20.476 --> 23:21.542
Take a hike till then.

23:21.567 --> 23:23.775
Happy to... as soon as Jacinda tells me

23:23.877 --> 23:25.547
what the hell is going on.

23:25.572 --> 23:29.047
Lucy is sneaking out of your
house in the middle of the night

23:29.149 --> 23:30.982
to meet up with some strange man?

23:31.084 --> 23:32.150
I can explain that.

23:32.219 --> 23:34.486
It's okay, Henry. This isn't your fault.

23:34.588 --> 23:35.580
I'll fix it.

23:35.605 --> 23:36.737
How?

23:36.990 --> 23:38.056
By day-drinking?

23:38.202 --> 23:40.802
If I remember, that's
how we ended up with Lucy

23:40.827 --> 23:41.893
in the first place.

23:41.995 --> 23:43.228
That's not fair.

23:43.296 --> 23:45.352
Life isn't fair, Jacinda.

23:46.466 --> 23:48.313
Lucy needs some stability.

23:48.338 --> 23:51.172
She needs someone she can count on.

23:51.438 --> 23:53.004
What are you saying?

23:53.073 --> 23:56.232
As of tomorrow, Lucy
moves back in with me,

23:57.364 --> 23:58.830
permanently.

24:05.975 --> 24:08.052
Well, I'm starting to understand
the whole Cinderella thing.

24:12.058 --> 24:14.659
I don't know what you're doing here,

24:14.990 --> 24:17.729
but you're not helping anyone.

24:17.798 --> 24:21.466
Lucy is a lonely little girl, Mr. Mills.

24:21.568 --> 24:24.702
Whatever hole you're trying to fill...

24:24.805 --> 24:27.071
she's not your answer.

24:27.174 --> 24:30.175
So do her a favor, and
go back to your books.

24:30.277 --> 24:33.344
Your fairy lands. Whatever
nonsense you write.

24:33.446 --> 24:36.481
Because in this world...
the real world...

24:36.583 --> 24:38.716
People get hurt.

24:38.819 --> 24:40.618
And if that happens,

24:40.720 --> 24:44.656
you'll be sorry you ever
stepped foot on this street.

25:05.879 --> 25:09.050
Hey. Hello. I think my car was stolen.

25:09.394 --> 25:12.717
Really? That sucks.

25:12.819 --> 25:15.266
Yeah. So... can you look for it?

25:15.665 --> 25:17.389
Sure. No problem.

25:17.491 --> 25:20.125
How 'bout I, uh, look
under my desk here.

25:20.227 --> 25:21.092
Nope...

25:21.194 --> 25:22.661
I'm stumped.

25:22.763 --> 25:25.430
Don't worry. I'll help you.

25:25.532 --> 25:27.399
Some of us still care about police work.

25:27.467 --> 25:30.168
Some of us still want to help people.

25:30.193 --> 25:32.513
Have at it, Eagle Scout.

25:33.840 --> 25:35.473
So what happened, mate?

25:35.575 --> 25:37.309
Missing auto?

25:37.411 --> 25:39.678
All right. Here. Fill this out.

25:39.780 --> 25:41.012
How long's this gonna take?

25:41.114 --> 25:43.181
Well, that's hard to tell.

25:43.250 --> 25:44.646
I'll call around the impound lots,

25:44.668 --> 25:46.268
but honestly... most people find them

25:46.336 --> 25:48.003
stripped in a parking lot somewhere.

25:48.028 --> 25:51.074
So our best bet's hitting the pavement.

25:51.099 --> 25:54.209
Yeah. Okay. Fine. Whatever it takes.

25:54.311 --> 25:56.411
I got to get out of this place.

25:59.614 --> 26:01.355
Can you get me out of this, please?

26:01.380 --> 26:02.551
Out of what?

26:08.845 --> 26:10.063
_

26:11.081 --> 26:12.460
Wait, "Alice"?

26:12.563 --> 26:14.162
You're the Alice? From Wonderland?

26:14.231 --> 26:16.464
And other places.

26:16.567 --> 26:19.067
You have one weird trip and
it's all anyone knows about you.

26:19.136 --> 26:20.368
Okay, well, I don't know
what this is all about,

26:20.437 --> 26:22.671
Alice from... wherever,

26:22.773 --> 26:23.772
but I got to get back now.

26:23.874 --> 26:25.540
Oh, no. Mm.

26:25.716 --> 26:26.925
You can't do that.

26:26.950 --> 26:27.843
Why not?

26:27.911 --> 26:29.444
Because this isn't your story,

26:29.934 --> 26:31.177
Henry Mills.

26:32.583 --> 26:33.715
How do you know who I am?

26:33.817 --> 26:35.417
I don't...

26:35.485 --> 26:38.320
but Rumplestiltskin does.

26:38.688 --> 26:39.665
You know Rumple?

26:39.690 --> 26:41.790
Don't you know by now your
grandpa knows everyone?

26:41.859 --> 26:43.091
He's watching out for you.

26:43.160 --> 26:44.793
Okay, look, I don't
have time for mind games.

26:44.895 --> 26:47.462
This isn't a game. Trust me.

26:47.564 --> 26:50.365
When it's not your story...

26:50.764 --> 26:53.301
bad things happen.

26:54.371 --> 26:56.004
You gonna stop me?

26:56.201 --> 26:57.772
Oh, no.

26:58.389 --> 27:00.508
When bad things happen...

27:00.849 --> 27:03.245
I want to be far, far away.

27:03.847 --> 27:05.457
Forget that Cinderella

27:05.482 --> 27:08.817
and go home.

27:08.886 --> 27:12.721
When someone needs help, I help them.

27:24.578 --> 27:26.311
Been looking for you.

27:26.336 --> 27:28.901
So, tell me. I want to hear everything.

27:28.926 --> 27:30.693
My car was stolen.

27:30.718 --> 27:31.717
What?

27:31.742 --> 27:33.174
You didn't help with
that in any way, did you?

27:33.277 --> 27:34.109
Of course not.

27:34.211 --> 27:35.744
My feet can't even reach the pedal.

27:35.846 --> 27:36.978
Mm-hmm.

27:37.047 --> 27:39.147
Well, if you remember
anything, you let me know. Okay?

27:39.249 --> 27:41.850
Wait. Where are you going?

27:41.952 --> 27:45.053
To look for my car, and
then I'm... going home.

27:45.122 --> 27:46.488
But you are home.

27:46.556 --> 27:48.356
Lucy, listen to me.

27:48.458 --> 27:50.325
Your mom is really nice.

27:50.394 --> 27:52.093
And I get the feeling that you
don't have the easiest life,

27:52.195 --> 27:53.128
and I'm sorry about that,

27:53.196 --> 27:54.829
but I am not the one who can save you.

27:54.898 --> 27:56.731
You still don't believe me.

27:56.833 --> 27:58.333
But you always believe!

27:58.435 --> 27:59.985
I can't go through this again.

28:00.266 --> 28:01.836
Wait!

28:01.905 --> 28:03.939
It didn't happen right
away with Emma either.

28:04.041 --> 28:06.041
Lucy, it was just a book.

28:06.143 --> 28:08.009
You are not my daughter.

28:08.111 --> 28:10.378
- But how do you know that?
- Because I know.

28:10.447 --> 28:13.315
- That's the curse.
- Stop it, Lucy! It's not a curse!

28:15.900 --> 28:17.986
I know because I had a family, okay?

28:18.055 --> 28:19.483
And I lost them.

28:21.140 --> 28:22.557
- What?
- I had a family.

28:22.659 --> 28:25.760
I had a wife and a kid that I
loved more than anything, and...

28:27.731 --> 28:29.664
Lucy, there was a fire...

28:29.766 --> 28:31.199
and they died.

28:32.472 --> 28:34.636
No. No, those are your cursed memories.

28:34.705 --> 28:37.072
I'm your daughter and
my mom is your wife

28:37.140 --> 28:39.107
- and your true love!
- But Lucy, listen to me.

28:39.209 --> 28:41.576
I would give anything for
another chance at a family,

28:41.678 --> 28:43.378
- but...
- You don't need another chance.

28:43.787 --> 28:45.257
We are your family.

28:45.282 --> 28:47.515
Please, you have to believe me.

28:47.617 --> 28:50.218
You have to. It's why you can't write.

28:50.320 --> 28:52.287
You're waiting for the
perfect first sentence.

28:52.389 --> 28:54.589
But no story is perfect.

28:54.691 --> 28:57.158
It just needs to start.

29:02.366 --> 29:05.767
I'm sorry, Lucy. I really am.

29:18.035 --> 29:19.134
Get in.

29:19.774 --> 29:21.516
Why? Where are we going?

29:22.203 --> 29:24.258
To live our story.

29:30.310 --> 29:31.643
Shoot!

29:31.745 --> 29:33.245
Damn it!

29:33.508 --> 29:35.189
Stupid car!

29:37.785 --> 29:39.951
It's not the car. It's the curse.

29:40.020 --> 29:42.454
It wants us to stay here.

29:46.238 --> 29:48.572
Come on, baby. We're walking.

29:57.204 --> 30:00.472
I must say, when my father
suggested this garish affair

30:00.574 --> 30:03.554
as a way to find a royal
bride, I had my doubts.

30:04.678 --> 30:07.145
But who knew I'd find a
girl as stunning as you...

30:10.883 --> 30:12.818
You don't recognize me, do you?

30:13.157 --> 30:15.253
Simple girl from a simple family

30:15.322 --> 30:18.924
that you destroyed.

30:23.860 --> 30:25.099
I can't.

30:26.874 --> 30:29.786
Thank you. You won't re...

30:38.412 --> 30:42.080
You never quite manage to finish
your chores, do you Cinderella?

30:43.134 --> 30:44.133
What?

30:44.158 --> 30:46.484
That fool rejected my Drizella.

30:46.962 --> 30:48.531
His younger brother, now...

30:48.556 --> 30:49.554
there's a man of taste.

30:49.623 --> 30:51.823
He's taken quite a shine to my girl.

30:52.550 --> 30:55.360
I had hoped that you would
do my dirty work for me.

30:55.915 --> 30:57.815
But at least there's one
thing you can still do...

30:57.948 --> 30:59.197
Guards!

30:59.581 --> 31:01.433
This woman assassinated the Prince!

31:06.073 --> 31:07.172
Henry.

31:07.241 --> 31:08.907
Take my bike and wait
for me where we first met.

31:08.976 --> 31:10.408
The portal to my land opens at midnight.

31:10.477 --> 31:12.919
You'll be safe there. You need to go!

31:13.247 --> 31:14.579
Stop that girl!

31:14.681 --> 31:16.581
That girl killed the Prince!

31:47.225 --> 31:48.942
Really? You checked
every lot and chop shop

31:48.967 --> 31:49.840
and none of them have my car?

31:49.865 --> 31:52.190
Yes. And seeing as I'm the only
one here willing to help you,

31:52.252 --> 31:54.451
you might want to curb
your agitation a bit.

31:54.771 --> 31:56.185
Sorry.

31:56.209 --> 31:59.283
Look, I'm on your
side. Just give me time.

31:59.308 --> 32:01.769
Officer Rogers, whatever
you're working on can wait.

32:01.794 --> 32:03.745
Ms. Belfrey, what can I do for you?

32:03.770 --> 32:05.339
Find my granddaughter.

32:05.597 --> 32:06.759
Lucy's missing?

32:06.784 --> 32:08.133
Mr. Mills, you're still here.

32:08.201 --> 32:09.601
Believe me, I'm trying not to be.

32:09.703 --> 32:10.999
Just need to find my car.

32:11.024 --> 32:12.704
Hm. Jacinda's also missing.

32:12.773 --> 32:15.307
I don't suppose you have any
idea where they ran off to,

32:15.409 --> 32:16.508
do you?

32:17.226 --> 32:18.398
Uh...

32:19.405 --> 32:20.571
No.

32:24.274 --> 32:26.351
Mr. Mills...

32:26.790 --> 32:29.487
I do know what you think of me,

32:29.790 --> 32:32.424
but I do care about my girls.

32:32.526 --> 32:34.292
You sure have a funny way of showing it.

32:35.305 --> 32:38.419
Jacinda tends to make mistakes.

32:38.444 --> 32:39.931
But if she wants to build a better life

32:40.033 --> 32:42.367
for herself and her daughter,

32:42.469 --> 32:46.084
she simply can't do it by
running away from her problems.

32:48.209 --> 32:50.041
Tell me what you know.

32:50.518 --> 32:51.845
You want your car back?

32:53.464 --> 32:55.313
Help me find my girls.

33:02.589 --> 33:05.790
I'm not going! Lucy, no.

33:05.859 --> 33:08.293
Hey. We can't stay.

33:08.395 --> 33:09.861
No.

33:10.265 --> 33:12.189
Listen, baby...

33:14.220 --> 33:17.045
There's something you don't know.

33:17.704 --> 33:19.204
Grandma wants you to live with her.

33:19.272 --> 33:20.472
Permanently.

33:20.906 --> 33:23.121
What? Why?

33:23.146 --> 33:24.546
It doesn't matter.

33:24.688 --> 33:26.011
See that island over there?

33:26.113 --> 33:29.289
That's where our story begins, Luce.

33:29.314 --> 33:31.214
That's where we can have a fresh start.

33:31.239 --> 33:32.205
Together.

33:32.283 --> 33:35.418
But what about Henry
and breaking the curse?

33:37.505 --> 33:40.658
You have such a big and
beautiful imagination.

33:40.727 --> 33:43.695
And I know why you want
to believe in fairy tales.

33:44.271 --> 33:46.240
Because life is hard.

33:47.012 --> 33:48.945
You got to believe in something.

33:49.951 --> 33:52.737
But just this once,

33:52.839 --> 33:55.073
can you believe in me?

34:00.320 --> 34:01.807
I believe, Mom.

34:03.386 --> 34:05.016
I believe in you.

34:15.797 --> 34:18.266
Lucy, come here. Now.

34:19.800 --> 34:21.841
Your grandmother is worried sick.

34:21.866 --> 34:24.069
Just not worried enough to show up.

34:24.170 --> 34:25.703
How'd you find us?

34:25.806 --> 34:29.206
Mr. Mills told us about
your little island fantasy.

34:29.275 --> 34:30.542
He was only trying to help.

34:30.643 --> 34:33.311
That's not true. He...
he wouldn't do that.

34:33.380 --> 34:35.580
The truth hurts more than fiction.

34:36.176 --> 34:37.581
Speaking of which...

34:37.684 --> 34:38.783
No!

34:38.885 --> 34:40.819
Officer Rogers, can you
please put this in evidence?

34:40.920 --> 34:42.887
Or get rid of it. Or destroy
it. Or... I don't care.

34:42.989 --> 34:44.522
It has caused enough trouble.

35:04.086 --> 35:06.186
Everything okay?

35:06.295 --> 35:08.061
Yeah, everything's okay.

35:14.029 --> 35:16.262
They found it, hm?

35:16.699 --> 35:17.864
Yeah.

35:17.933 --> 35:19.698
Cops found it abandoned
on the side of the road.

35:19.723 --> 35:21.668
Nothing taken. No damage.

35:21.736 --> 35:23.803
Doesn't make any sense.

35:23.872 --> 35:26.973
Yeah, well, life doesn't
make any sense sometimes.

35:27.075 --> 35:29.542
But you got what you
wanted, so that's good.

35:29.611 --> 35:32.312
For you. I hope it was worth it.

35:32.380 --> 35:36.015
Look, I didn't ask to be
dragged into your family drama.

35:36.117 --> 35:38.128
Goodbye, Henry Mills.

35:38.153 --> 35:40.354
And good luck on that second book.

35:47.028 --> 35:48.862
Cinderella!

35:48.930 --> 35:50.899
Cinderella, I'm here!

35:52.876 --> 35:54.376
Cinderella?!

36:01.309 --> 36:03.676
Yeah, I know. I was
crazy to think she'd come.

36:04.912 --> 36:07.013
Ah, you get it.

36:50.792 --> 36:53.860
Operation Glass Slipper is a go.

36:59.547 --> 37:01.914
Hey, Eagle Scout.

37:02.102 --> 37:03.902
I hear congrats are in order.

37:04.239 --> 37:05.772
What are you talking about?

37:05.840 --> 37:07.407
You made detective.

37:07.894 --> 37:10.777
Looks like somebody
has a fairy godmother.

37:10.879 --> 37:14.380
Ms. Belfrey must have
taken a liking to you.

37:14.449 --> 37:17.483
Come on, I'll introduce
you to your new partner.

37:17.552 --> 37:20.153
So I tell the punk, "Go ahead.

37:20.255 --> 37:22.121
Give me the finger one more time,

37:22.190 --> 37:23.890
and you'll be picking it off the floor."

37:23.959 --> 37:24.991
And did he?

37:25.093 --> 37:26.893
No. But I broke his finger anyway.

37:28.630 --> 37:32.031
Hey, Detective. Special delivery for ya.

37:32.133 --> 37:34.100
Meet your new partner.

37:37.059 --> 37:38.240
A pleasure...

37:41.276 --> 37:42.809
Detective.

37:45.113 --> 37:47.146
We'll do great work together.

38:05.056 --> 38:06.789
Nah.

38:06.814 --> 38:09.282
I don't think I'm gonna
give you my bar today.

38:09.437 --> 38:11.404
What? We had a deal.

38:11.506 --> 38:12.672
Yeah, well, that was yesterday.

38:12.774 --> 38:13.973
And what happened today?

38:14.075 --> 38:15.828
Your step-daughter...

38:16.788 --> 38:18.321
She inspired me.

38:18.346 --> 38:19.479
By running away?

38:19.547 --> 38:22.169
By not giving in to you.

38:23.685 --> 38:25.251
You're so used to pushing people around,

38:25.320 --> 38:26.919
I think it's time you
felt what it's like

38:27.022 --> 38:28.688
when someone pushes back.

38:28.790 --> 38:30.388
You can't win.

38:31.080 --> 38:33.013
Maybe.

38:33.548 --> 38:34.947
Maybe not.

38:36.229 --> 38:40.967
Today... I watched you march into my bar

38:41.036 --> 38:44.337
acting like you own the place.

38:44.439 --> 38:46.372
And you know what?

38:46.474 --> 38:48.174
I didn't like it.

38:48.243 --> 38:49.509
And I realized...

38:49.577 --> 38:52.011
if I sign this piece of
paper you will own this place.

38:52.036 --> 38:54.971
And that I really don't like.

38:55.339 --> 38:57.750
This is my bar.

38:58.511 --> 39:00.353
It's my home.

39:02.524 --> 39:04.624
It's my life.

39:06.594 --> 39:07.963
Sure, it's seen better days,

39:07.988 --> 39:11.180
but that doesn't mean it
won't have better days again.

39:13.124 --> 39:16.916
And just because life isn't
what you want it to be right now,

39:18.440 --> 39:20.740
doesn't mean you should tear it down.

39:33.088 --> 39:35.788
I started thinking about

39:35.890 --> 39:38.246
all the things I want to do and have

39:40.106 --> 39:43.324
that I'm not doing or having.

39:46.038 --> 39:47.570
Excuse me?

39:47.595 --> 39:49.669
- This is 10th and Oak, right? 
- Uh-huh.

39:49.771 --> 39:51.204
Shouldn't there be a
cemetery right here?

39:51.306 --> 39:52.371
Not that I know of.

39:52.440 --> 39:55.274
Been like this long as I can remember.

40:03.651 --> 40:05.382
And how everyone in this neighborhood

40:05.407 --> 40:06.477
seems to have given up

40:06.502 --> 40:09.055
imagining what a better
life might look like...

40:17.966 --> 40:20.967
But if we can admit to ourselves

40:21.035 --> 40:25.204
what we want is out there somewhere...

40:27.208 --> 40:29.776
then maybe we can fight for it.

40:29.844 --> 40:32.419
And if we do that... then
we're halfway to getting it.

40:35.183 --> 40:37.887
That's the thing about
the people of this town...

40:39.629 --> 40:42.288
Things can seem...

40:42.390 --> 40:44.824
hopeless.

40:47.061 --> 40:49.128
When suddenly,

40:49.197 --> 40:54.934
someone gives the rest of us...

40:56.651 --> 40:58.884
inspiration.

41:03.602 --> 41:07.727
_

41:09.284 --> 41:12.218
Because the first step
to a new beginning...

41:12.865 --> 41:15.623
is imagining that one is even possible.

41:17.185 --> 41:19.525
And I'll be damned

41:19.627 --> 41:21.568
if I stand by

41:22.089 --> 41:25.223
and let a bully like you...

41:25.466 --> 41:28.301
take that away from us anymore.

41:28.403 --> 41:30.706
Now if you'll excuse me.
