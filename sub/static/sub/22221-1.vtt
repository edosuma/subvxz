WEBVTT

00:02.837 --> 00:05.169
Pilot:
The Sheyang vessel is
about to fire.

00:05.256 --> 00:06.962
Starburst. Starburst now.

00:07.049 --> 00:08.789
Moya can't. She isn't ready.

00:08.885 --> 00:10.876
Zhaan! Zhaan, do something.

00:10.970 --> 00:12.506
D'Argo. He can help him.

00:12.597 --> 00:14.178
He can talk to them.
-No, no, no.

00:14.265 --> 00:15.926
Listen to me. D'Argo is gone.

00:16.017 --> 00:18.349
No D'Argo, no Aeryn,
no Crichton.

00:18.436 --> 00:21.223
Just us, okay? And in a few
microts, we'll be dead, too.

00:21.314 --> 00:24.181
No, D'Argo can save us.

00:24.275 --> 00:25.185
He can.

00:25.276 --> 00:27.392
He, he has to save us.

00:28.070 --> 00:28.650
They're firing.

00:28.738 --> 00:30.274
D'Argo, we need you.

00:34.869 --> 00:36.200
Zhaan?!

00:37.079 --> 00:41.618
(echoing screams )
D'Argo!

00:42.919 --> 00:44.284
D'Argo.

00:44.378 --> 00:45.584
Shake it off.

00:45.671 --> 00:49.209
Come on Rock, get off the
canvas. You can do it.

00:49.300 --> 00:53.168
Rise and shine. Up and at 'em.
Break through.

00:53.262 --> 00:54.547
Man, this is getting old.

00:54.639 --> 00:56.721
The least you can do is
talk in your sleep.

00:59.268 --> 01:00.178
What would you like me to say?

01:00.269 --> 01:03.181
Whoa. How about great
to be back?

01:03.272 --> 01:04.182
Was I away?

01:04.273 --> 01:05.888
You sure as hell were. Days.

01:05.983 --> 01:07.564
I don't know how many.
I kind of lost track of time.

01:07.652 --> 01:09.108
Do you know who I am?

01:09.195 --> 01:12.107
Yes, I recognize you, John, but
I do not recognize this place.

01:12.198 --> 01:13.187
Am I dead?

01:13.282 --> 01:15.273
-No.
-Am I dead?!

01:15.368 --> 01:17.199
No.

01:17.286 --> 01:18.401
You're not dead.

01:21.791 --> 01:24.999
l, uh... lthought
we were dead.

01:25.086 --> 01:26.041
Why aren't we?

01:26.128 --> 01:27.208
Aeryn.

01:27.296 --> 01:29.161
She finally managed to scoop
us up, brought us here.

01:29.257 --> 01:31.543
Some asteroid.

01:31.634 --> 01:35.047
Abandoned mining camp, factory.
I don't know, something
like that.

01:35.137 --> 01:36.468
Where is she?

01:36.555 --> 01:38.466
She's in the Prowler,
grocery shopping.

01:38.557 --> 01:43.347
This rock gets a nine on
atmosphere but only two
on food and water.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.769
We have a lot to thank her for.

01:45.856 --> 01:47.187
Yeah.

01:49.068 --> 01:50.478
Aeryn:
Prowler to Talyn.

01:50.569 --> 01:52.184
Crais:
What delayed you?

01:52.280 --> 01:53.736
You were supposed to check in
two arns ago.

01:53.823 --> 01:55.905
I can't always get away
on schedule.

01:55.992 --> 01:59.234
Don't forget, I have to give
Crichton a reason for
my absence.

01:59.328 --> 02:01.614
He still has no knowledge
of our arrangement?

02:01.706 --> 02:03.242
Aeryn:
None.

02:03.332 --> 02:05.709
It might facilitate matters
if you explained to him.

02:05.793 --> 02:06.623
No.

02:06.711 --> 02:09.453
Eventually, you'll have to.

02:10.673 --> 02:13.915
Only when it's too late
for him to interfere.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.803
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

02:23.894 --> 02:27.307
A radiation wave hit and I got
shot through a wormhole.

02:27.398 --> 02:30.014
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship,

02:30.109 --> 02:33.442
a living ship, full of strange
alien life-forms.

02:33.529 --> 02:34.314
Help me.

02:34.405 --> 02:35.861
Listen, please.

02:35.948 --> 02:37.779
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

02:37.867 --> 02:42.156
I'm being hunted by an insane
military commander.

02:42.246 --> 02:44.362
I'm doing everything I can.

02:44.457 --> 02:47.290
I'm just looking for
a way home.

03:07.396 --> 03:09.387
Crichton:
You sure your memory's okay?

03:09.482 --> 03:11.723
How long was I without
oxygen for?

03:11.817 --> 03:14.433
Long enough to scare the
hell out of me.

03:14.528 --> 03:17.190
What's the last thing
you remember?

03:17.281 --> 03:18.316
Space.

03:18.407 --> 03:19.271
Kronite.

03:19.367 --> 03:21.323
Gammak base aflame.

03:21.410 --> 03:23.196
Magnificent sight.

03:23.287 --> 03:24.197
Absolutely.

03:24.288 --> 03:26.119
Did Moya get away?

03:26.207 --> 03:29.119
Moya did but Talyn...

03:29.210 --> 03:29.949
Talyn?

03:30.044 --> 03:31.784
Yeah, Moya's baby.

03:32.588 --> 03:33.623
Awful name.

03:33.714 --> 03:34.749
What happened to him?

03:34.840 --> 03:36.626
Crais happened.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.002
He made off with the baby.

03:38.094 --> 03:39.959
We should never have
let him live.

03:40.054 --> 03:42.340
-Yeah, I know.
What happened to the
Command Carrier?

03:42.431 --> 03:43.386
It's still in the area.

03:43.474 --> 03:45.385
Aeryn has spotted Marauders

03:45.476 --> 03:47.683
checking the asteroid field out
but they haven't seen us yet.

03:47.770 --> 03:50.352
So now we have to
evade Scorpius.

03:50.439 --> 03:54.398
And then we have to find Crais,
remove him from Talyn.

03:54.485 --> 03:56.225
Who the yotz named him Talyn?

03:56.320 --> 03:58.982
I did. After my father.

04:00.699 --> 04:03.281
Aeryn, check out who finally
woke up from his little siesta.

04:03.369 --> 04:04.905
Yes, l have eyes, Crichton.

04:04.995 --> 04:09.614
l have eyes as well, and they're
very pleased to see you alive.

04:12.294 --> 04:13.579
Hey, yo.

04:13.671 --> 04:15.161
What's the matter?
Is there a problem?

04:15.256 --> 04:16.996
All I managed to find
was a little water.

04:17.091 --> 04:18.376
I'll have to keep exploring.

04:18.467 --> 04:21.174
If this asteroid is unsuitable
then we should all leave.

04:21.262 --> 04:22.502
Good idea. Change of scenery.

04:22.596 --> 04:23.972
No.

04:24.056 --> 04:25.557
This is the only asteroid I've
seen with structures

04:25.641 --> 04:27.256
that'll hide you from the
Marauder patrols.

04:27.351 --> 04:30.309
Yeah, but D'Argo's awake.

04:30.396 --> 04:33.183
We get out of the asteroid, we
signal to Moya, she comes
and she picks us up.

04:33.274 --> 04:36.357
We don't even know if Moya is
in range and we can't outrun
a Command Carrier.

04:36.444 --> 04:38.856
So we have to remain hidden
until the Carrier withdraws.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.106
What if it never does?

04:40.197 --> 04:41.403
Well, Scorpius can't look
for us forever,

04:41.490 --> 04:43.276
and he can't even be certain
that you survived.

04:43.367 --> 04:45.107
Aeryn, Scorpius wants
me pretty bad.

04:45.202 --> 04:47.693
His patience may outlast our
Prowler's fuel.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.700
When the Prowler's fuel runs
out we starve.

04:50.791 --> 04:55.000
As John once said, I would
rather go down on a swing.

04:55.087 --> 04:57.203
"Swinging." That you want
to go down "swinging."

04:57.298 --> 04:58.253
Swinging.

04:58.340 --> 04:59.671
The only reason we'll starve

04:59.758 --> 05:01.214
is if you don't stop this
useless discussion

05:01.302 --> 05:02.758
and let me keep searching
for food.

05:02.845 --> 05:04.210
-This discussion...
-Aeryn, D'Argo.

05:04.305 --> 05:05.795
Stop it! Both of you.

05:05.890 --> 05:07.926
If not for me you'd both
be dead, all right?

05:08.017 --> 05:09.848
So stop fighting me!

05:21.447 --> 05:23.904
Chiana:
Rygel, eat.

05:23.991 --> 05:26.778
I can't eat.

05:26.869 --> 05:28.951
What, you... you can't eat?

05:29.038 --> 05:31.029
Nnn...

05:31.123 --> 05:32.704
What? Any fever?

05:32.791 --> 05:34.247
Or dizziness?

05:34.335 --> 05:36.542
Or secretions that are even
abnormal for you?

05:36.629 --> 05:39.541
I'm not sick.
I'm simply not hungry.

05:39.632 --> 05:41.543
Ask Pilot why.

05:41.634 --> 05:43.215
Bad news, Pilot?

05:43.302 --> 05:46.669
Moya is returning to the
asteroid field where she
last saw Talyn.

05:46.764 --> 05:47.514
What?

05:47.598 --> 05:49.179
There, you see?

05:49.266 --> 05:52.633
ls Moya unclear on the concept
of why we ran away?

05:52.728 --> 05:57.142
She insists on searching for
her offspring despite the risk.

05:57.233 --> 06:01.226
A Peacekeeper Command Carrier
is slightly more than a risk.

06:01.320 --> 06:07.281
Moya and l have chosen a course
that should allow us to
re-enter the field undetected.

06:07.368 --> 06:09.950
But even then, we're flying
back in unarmed, defenseless.

06:10.037 --> 06:12.028
We aren't entirely defenseless.

06:12.122 --> 06:13.828
Hal As good as.

06:13.916 --> 06:19.127
All we have is that antiquated
defense screen we took from the
wreck of the Zelbinion.

06:19.213 --> 06:20.373
This pile of dren?

06:20.464 --> 06:21.965
Well, l-is it even functional?

06:22.049 --> 06:26.133
I'll have the DRDs give it
a thorough going-over.

06:26.220 --> 06:28.802
Moya doesn't understand
your distress.

06:28.889 --> 06:32.882
Besides Talyn, we might also
find Crichton, D'Argo
and Aeryn.

06:32.977 --> 06:37.311
If they could have gotten out,
they would have by now.

07:04.425 --> 07:07.258
All patrols still report
nothing, sir.

07:07.344 --> 07:09.209
Uh, no signal from Leviathan
offspring.

07:09.305 --> 07:11.637
No trace of Crichton.

07:11.724 --> 07:13.260
Nothing.

07:14.727 --> 07:19.061
| comprehend the meaning of
nothing, Lieutenant.

07:19.148 --> 07:21.480
After Crichton ejected from
the Transport,

07:21.567 --> 07:26.277
it may have been a mistake to
pull back and allow that rogue
Prowler to rescue him.

07:26.363 --> 07:28.228
Oh, you had little choice, sir.

07:28.324 --> 07:29.814
Oh, true.

07:29.908 --> 07:34.447
He would have chosen to perish
rather than be saved by us.

07:34.538 --> 07:36.494
But...

07:38.459 --> 07:43.044
the Prowler eluded capture,

07:43.130 --> 07:45.246
and continues to.

07:45.341 --> 07:48.333
In a field of this size,
we may never find it.

07:49.219 --> 07:51.505
Time for a change of tactics.

08:00.481 --> 08:03.188
Talyn! Stop this senseless
behavior.

08:03.275 --> 08:06.142
You mother has gone.
Do you understand?

08:06.236 --> 08:08.443
Moya has abandoned you.

08:10.324 --> 08:11.564
What are you doing?

08:11.659 --> 08:15.243
Power down your engines
at once.

08:15.329 --> 08:19.117
Leaving the protection of the
field right now is suicidal.

08:19.208 --> 08:22.575
I know you detest all
this hiding.

08:22.670 --> 08:25.207
You're a gunship, a warrior.

08:25.297 --> 08:27.253
You want to move, to fight.

08:27.341 --> 08:30.253
But you're not yet strong enough
to take on a Command Carrier.

08:30.344 --> 08:32.175
He's going berserk.

08:32.262 --> 08:33.547
Talk to him!

08:33.639 --> 08:35.254
Talyn.

08:35.349 --> 08:37.214
What's the matter?

08:38.310 --> 08:39.925
Show us.

08:42.314 --> 08:44.270
There's no reason to be afraid.

08:44.358 --> 08:46.223
I'm here.

08:46.318 --> 08:47.854
So is Crais.

08:47.945 --> 08:51.688
Talyn, we want to help
you, please.

08:51.782 --> 08:54.489
Let us see what's upsetting you.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.568
Communications.

09:00.791 --> 09:03.157
Broadband transmissions.

09:03.252 --> 09:05.868
Random noises mixed with
distortion spikes.

09:05.963 --> 09:07.203
Scorpius.

09:07.297 --> 09:10.425
Talyn, these signals
mean nothing.

09:10.509 --> 09:13.467
They're intended to alarm you
and to make you run.

09:13.554 --> 09:16.591
Talyn, do not play into the
hands of your enemy.

09:16.682 --> 09:19.765
Remain right where you are.

09:19.852 --> 09:24.437
You're brave enough to
do that, aren't you?

09:24.523 --> 09:27.481
( systems powering down )

09:32.072 --> 09:33.232
Very good, Talyn.

09:33.323 --> 09:38.192
Talyn, excuse us for a moment.

09:38.287 --> 09:40.994
D'Argo's regained
consciousness.

09:41.081 --> 09:44.744
He and Crichton are
eager to leave.

09:44.835 --> 09:47.702
And don't suggest that we
simply abandon them

09:47.796 --> 09:50.173
because that was not part
of our arrangement.

09:50.257 --> 09:54.250
We can't leave just yet.

09:54.344 --> 09:56.335
Talyn is still too immature.

09:56.430 --> 10:02.346
No weapons, no Starburst and
he continues to ignore
my commands.

10:02.436 --> 10:05.269
You can't command a Leviathan.
You can only persuade.

10:05.355 --> 10:10.349
Talyn is part Leviathan, part
Peacekeeper. He was designed
to take orders.

10:11.528 --> 10:14.486
Why don't you let me
talk to him?

10:15.115 --> 10:16.821
Alone.

10:16.909 --> 10:18.524
No.

10:18.619 --> 10:21.110
I'm willing to share
command of Talyn.

10:21.205 --> 10:24.197
I will not relinquish it.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.115
-Again?
-Yeah.

10:27.211 --> 10:28.576
One, two, three.

10:28.670 --> 10:30.456
(laughing)

10:30.547 --> 10:31.502
Again, I win.

10:31.590 --> 10:33.922
No, I win. Paper wraps rock.

10:34.009 --> 10:35.670
No, paper cannot possibly
beat rock.

10:35.761 --> 10:37.046
It does. Paper beats rock.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.343
Rock rips through paper.

10:38.430 --> 10:40.091
D'Argo, that's not how
it works.

10:40.182 --> 10:42.298
-Paper beats rock.
-That is unrealistic.

10:42.392 --> 10:45.429
Well, it's the rules and it's
not supposed to be realistic.

10:45.521 --> 10:47.603
It's supposed to be
entertaining.

10:47.689 --> 10:49.350
My coma was more entertaining.

10:49.441 --> 10:51.147
It's a kid's game.

10:52.486 --> 10:53.601
Aeryn.

10:53.695 --> 10:54.730
Good hunting?

10:54.822 --> 10:55.937
Should we give you a hand?

10:56.031 --> 10:56.611
No need.

10:56.698 --> 10:57.733
No. It's no problem.

10:57.825 --> 10:59.531
What did I say?
ldon't need any help.

10:59.618 --> 11:01.825
You know what? I think you do.

11:01.912 --> 11:03.573
I'm certain you do.

11:03.664 --> 11:05.279
This is ridiculous.

11:05.374 --> 11:06.830
l have a question.

11:06.917 --> 11:09.408
How many times have we saved
each others lives?

11:09.503 --> 11:10.959
I've lost count.

11:11.046 --> 11:12.081
Safe to say more than once?

11:12.172 --> 11:13.252
Sure.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.422
Right. And how many times have
you and I been close?

11:21.682 --> 11:22.762
Just the once.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.135
(clearing throat)

11:24.226 --> 11:26.433
No, no, uh, not that
kind of close.

11:26.520 --> 11:29.102
Oh, uh, friend close?

11:29.189 --> 11:30.053
Yes.

11:30.148 --> 11:30.853
Um...

11:30.941 --> 11:31.930
(clearing throat)

11:32.025 --> 11:34.232
Um, 'em, ah, ah,
more than once.

11:34.319 --> 11:37.026
Yeah, right. Well.

11:37.114 --> 11:42.279
Whatever our relationship is...

11:42.369 --> 11:44.781
we should be at a place where
we can trust one another.

11:47.249 --> 11:48.989
I think you're holding
something back.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.164
Look me in the eye.

11:54.298 --> 11:55.538
Look me in the eye.

11:55.632 --> 11:58.294
Tell me that I'm wrong.

12:08.186 --> 12:10.677
You're not going to like
what I have to say.

12:11.189 --> 12:13.350
Maybe not.

12:14.735 --> 12:18.648
In order to save your lives I
had to make a deal with Crais.

12:18.739 --> 12:19.569
What?!

12:19.656 --> 12:21.521
Slow down. Stop.

12:21.617 --> 12:23.573
You had to what?

12:23.660 --> 12:28.199
By the time | retrieved you,
Moya had gone you were both
about to suffocate.

12:28.290 --> 12:30.155
And then Crais signaled
me from Talyn

12:30.250 --> 12:33.117
with the coordinates to an
oxygen-atmosphere asteroid.

12:33.211 --> 12:34.496
This asteroid.

12:34.588 --> 12:37.705
I never would have found it on
my own. Not in time, anyway.

12:37.799 --> 12:39.414
Back up.

12:39.509 --> 12:42.000
What's your end in this deal?

12:42.095 --> 12:45.132
When Moya left, Talyn got
upset, stopped obeying Crais.

12:45.223 --> 12:51.219
I agreed to help calm Talyn
down and teach him to start
obeying Crais's orders.

12:51.313 --> 12:52.644
Oh, well...

12:52.731 --> 12:54.471
that makes sense.

12:54.566 --> 12:58.775
You're helping Talyn obey the
guy who kidnapped him?!

12:58.862 --> 13:00.147
I didn't have a another choice.

13:00.238 --> 13:01.569
You should have let us die.

13:01.657 --> 13:02.897
No, I couldn't have.

13:02.991 --> 13:05.277
That offspring has weaponry!

13:05.369 --> 13:08.111
And you've put that weaponry
within the grasp of Crais.

13:08.205 --> 13:09.741
Oh, what would you prefer,
D'Argo?

13:09.831 --> 13:13.119
That Scorpius gets Talyn,
or destroys Talyn?

13:13.210 --> 13:16.953
Right now, even Crais's
control is better than
no control at all.

13:17.047 --> 13:18.162
Right now?!

13:18.256 --> 13:21.089
When exactly is that going
to change, Aeryn?

13:21.176 --> 13:24.885
After Crais has brainwashed him
he's going to give him back?!

13:24.972 --> 13:27.054
I told you you wouldn't
like what I had to say.

13:27.140 --> 13:27.674
ldonﬂ

13:27.766 --> 13:28.676
Neither do |.

13:28.767 --> 13:29.973
Yeah, well, it's all we have.

13:30.060 --> 13:31.220
No, it isn't.

13:36.817 --> 13:40.480
All right, we cannot allow
Crais to remain aboard Talyn.
Do you agree?

13:40.570 --> 13:42.071
Absolutely.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.316
She's going to be pissed
when she gets up, though.

13:44.408 --> 13:45.614
It was a time-saver.

13:45.701 --> 13:48.283
You look after her while I go
and break Crais' neck.

13:48.370 --> 13:50.326
D'Argo, you couldn't break
wind right now.

13:50.414 --> 13:52.621
I'm going.

13:52.708 --> 13:54.869
I owe Crais.

13:56.044 --> 13:58.501
You think I don't owe him?

14:00.257 --> 14:02.213
Shoot for it.

14:03.844 --> 14:05.209
One, two, three.

14:06.638 --> 14:08.594
I'll see ya.

14:08.682 --> 14:12.516
( chanting softly)

14:12.602 --> 14:15.184
Zhaan? It's me.

14:16.314 --> 14:18.100
Hello?

14:18.191 --> 14:20.352
It's me. Chiana.

14:21.737 --> 14:25.355
Look, I hate to disturb you
while you're so busy.

14:25.449 --> 14:27.280
Well, not that I understand
what you're doing.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.403
I mean, I understand it's part
of the Delvian Seek thing

14:29.494 --> 14:32.327
so you can become a priest
again or...

14:32.414 --> 14:34.530
or something...

14:34.624 --> 14:37.161
But I don't see how it works.

14:38.712 --> 14:41.749
Not that it's my business.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.922
You have 30 microts.

14:44.009 --> 14:46.375
Moya's got some farhbot idea
about going back

14:46.470 --> 14:48.677
to the asteroid field to
look for her baby

14:48.764 --> 14:50.550
even though we're sure to get
captured by Peacekeepers

14:50.640 --> 14:52.505
and I don't have to tell you
what happens then.

14:52.601 --> 14:54.967
So, I was wondering if you could
talk to Pilot so he could
talk to Moya

14:55.062 --> 14:57.394
to convince her that this bad
idea is, well, a bad idea.

14:57.481 --> 14:59.142
Did you get all that?

14:59.232 --> 15:00.187
Yes.

15:00.275 --> 15:02.266
So, you'll do it?

15:03.111 --> 15:04.271
No.

15:04.362 --> 15:06.068
Aeryn:
You've killed all three
of us now.

15:06.156 --> 15:08.989
Without Crais and Talyn's
help we'll never get
out of here alive.

15:09.076 --> 15:13.911
Do you really think that Crais
would return us to Moya once
Talyn is under his control?

15:13.997 --> 15:16.238
His word is worth
next to nothing.

15:16.333 --> 15:19.370
He no longer considers
himself a Peacekeeper.

15:19.461 --> 15:20.746
Or so he claims.

15:20.837 --> 15:23.123
I believe him. He knows Scorpius
would have him executed.

15:23.215 --> 15:25.422
Oh, then his conversion doesn't
mean much, does it?

15:25.509 --> 15:28.842
Well, perhaps not, but he is
a fugitive, just as we are

15:28.929 --> 15:32.888
which means that his goals and
ours may no longer conflict.

15:32.974 --> 15:36.341
If he has deserted the
Peacekeepers,

15:36.436 --> 15:39.303
then his loyalties lie
only to himself,

15:39.397 --> 15:43.231
which makes him more dangerous
not less.

15:47.697 --> 15:50.939
Locking scramble,
Security Three Velka.

15:51.034 --> 15:52.774
Please confirm.

15:52.869 --> 15:54.530
Scramble confirmed.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.327
Proceed.

15:56.414 --> 15:57.790
The gunship is still...

15:57.874 --> 15:59.660
not my concern.

15:59.751 --> 16:01.252
Where's Crichton?

16:01.336 --> 16:04.203
Officer Sun won't tell me yet.

16:04.297 --> 16:09.917
Building her trust is
time-consuming, as is building
the gunship's trust.

16:10.011 --> 16:11.922
The latter task is made
no easier

16:12.013 --> 16:15.471
when the gunship is panicked by
your spurious transmissions.

16:15.559 --> 16:20.303
Your progress report was
overdue, I concluded you
were incapacitated,

16:20.397 --> 16:22.558
and I attempted to retrieve
the gunship.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.389
Then it is among your concerns?

16:24.484 --> 16:27.271
As a means to recovering
Crichton, no more.

16:27.362 --> 16:32.777
Deliver Crichton to me and
I will allow you to keep
the gunship.

16:32.868 --> 16:39.114
Demonstrate some of the
formidable patience you're
always bragging you possess.

16:39.207 --> 16:42.370
My patience is formidable,
Crais...

16:43.420 --> 16:45.786
but it is not infinite.

16:48.717 --> 16:51.379
Crais:
Talyn, you heard Scorpius.

16:51.469 --> 16:53.676
You are not his concern.

16:53.763 --> 16:56.300
Merely a too! he can use
or barter away.

16:56.391 --> 16:59.224
This is how the Peacekeepers
treat their own.

16:59.311 --> 17:01.393
You, me, Officer Sun.

17:01.479 --> 17:05.392
But we are alike now.
Orphaned from all we ever knew.

17:05.483 --> 17:08.270
We have only one another
to rely upon.

17:08.361 --> 17:12.274
You must believe me, trust me.

17:13.783 --> 17:14.943
Crichton.

17:15.035 --> 17:17.447
I know. I know. Sorry.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.152
You know, I should have called

17:19.247 --> 17:22.580
but I was in the neighborhood,
thought I'd drop in, say hi.

17:24.502 --> 17:25.662
How you doing?

17:25.754 --> 17:28.496
Where's Officer Sun?
Have you harmed her?

17:28.590 --> 17:31.206
You're asking me if I've
harmed Aeryn?

17:32.594 --> 17:35.176
That's a winner, Crais.

17:35.263 --> 17:37.345
Do Sebaceans have a word
for "Chutzpah"?

17:37.432 --> 17:38.638
What do you want, Crichton?

17:38.725 --> 17:40.966
Oh, a couple of things.

17:41.061 --> 17:43.302
Your head on a platter,
for starters.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.897
l'm unarmed.

17:44.981 --> 17:47.017
You can kill me easily.

17:47.651 --> 17:48.936
Be warned, however.

17:49.027 --> 17:51.689
Talyn regards me as a friend.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.942
Interesting.

17:55.033 --> 17:57.900
I heard that you had a long way
to go in that department.

17:57.994 --> 17:59.154
I have.

17:59.246 --> 18:01.282
Nevertheless, I believe he
would react badly to my death

18:01.373 --> 18:03.238
and retaliate by killing you.

18:03.333 --> 18:05.324
Oh.

18:05.418 --> 18:11.254
Well, but if you're dead,
he's out of your clutches.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.507
A fair price to pay, I'd say.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.969
Consider this.

18:18.056 --> 18:23.050
Neither of us wants to see
Talyn in Scorpius' hands.

18:24.312 --> 18:26.268
Okay.

18:26.356 --> 18:28.142
I give.

18:28.233 --> 18:30.315
What do you want, Crais?

18:31.111 --> 18:33.648
Simply to escape.

18:33.738 --> 18:36.980
To travel deeper into the
Uncharted Territories.

18:37.075 --> 18:39.361
To re-examine my path.

18:42.622 --> 18:45.534
You want to have a
midlife crisis?

18:46.334 --> 18:47.995
Fine.

18:48.086 --> 18:54.423
Just ditch the firm, head off
to Maui, shack up with
a supermodel,

18:54.509 --> 18:58.593
but you do not get to
keep the Porsche!

18:58.680 --> 19:02.343
You don't get the keys
to Moya's baby.

19:03.435 --> 19:06.222
Talyn. Intruder.

19:08.565 --> 19:10.521
( groans )

19:11.568 --> 19:14.150
You're about to lose your head.

19:14.237 --> 19:16.944
Now, tell Talyn to put
away the toys.

19:17.449 --> 19:18.985
Talyn...

19:24.748 --> 19:26.784
Now open the hatch.

19:29.294 --> 19:32.081
We're going to go for
a little drive.

19:36.801 --> 19:38.302
Wha...? Pilot!

19:38.386 --> 19:40.092
What the yotz was that?

19:40.180 --> 19:42.262
Moya is accelerating.

19:42.349 --> 19:43.338
I know that.

19:43.433 --> 19:45.264
I felt it in all three stomachs.

19:45.352 --> 19:48.014
She heard a transmission
from Talyn.

19:48.104 --> 19:52.063
He's in the asteroid field,
apparently in great pain.

19:52.150 --> 19:54.061
I'll try to find out more.

19:54.152 --> 19:56.063
Moya's in full lunatic
mother mode.

19:56.154 --> 19:59.112
She'll blunder right into
Scorpius' bad teeth.

19:59.199 --> 20:05.240
Ah, that, ah... module thing
of Crichton's is still
operational.

20:07.248 --> 20:08.988
We could let Moya go on
without us.

20:09.084 --> 20:10.415
Mmm, we could.

20:10.502 --> 20:14.415
Not that any planet in this
vicinity was very hospitable.

20:14.506 --> 20:16.212
(grunts)

20:16.299 --> 20:21.384
Pilot and... Pilot and Moya
didn't abandon us during
Zhaan's trial.

20:22.430 --> 20:23.806
We can't ditch.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.346
We have to stick.

20:25.433 --> 20:27.264
Stupid though it may be.

20:27.352 --> 20:32.847
There is a transport pod
available should you not wish
to accompany us.

20:32.941 --> 20:35.353
What? Leave you and Moya?

20:35.443 --> 20:37.479
No. We... we couldn't!

20:37.570 --> 20:38.821
Could we?

20:38.905 --> 20:41.897
Uh, no. Oh, we'd never
consider such a thing.

20:41.991 --> 20:43.447
(grunts)

20:43.535 --> 20:47.323
Scorpius:
This transmission can only
be one thing:

20:47.414 --> 20:49.075
a Leviathan distress call.

20:49.165 --> 20:52.123
Then if Moya is anywhere in the
area, she should come running.

20:52.210 --> 20:55.373
But the gunship has not emerged
from the asteroid field.

20:55.463 --> 21:01.208
If Moya joins her offspring
in concealment, we have
gained nothing.

21:14.691 --> 21:20.152
Nearing the origin of Talyn's
transmission, but there's
no sign of Talyn.

21:20.238 --> 21:23.150
He may have fled further
into the field.

21:23.241 --> 21:24.777
Any other ships around?

21:24.868 --> 21:25.823
None.

21:25.910 --> 21:27.491
Wait. A Prowler.

21:27.579 --> 21:29.035
Has it seen us?

21:29.122 --> 21:31.408
Apparently, it's changing
course to intersect with ours.

21:31.499 --> 21:34.115
It's been a thrill,
Your Frogness.

21:34.210 --> 21:38.499
May your afterlife be almost
as pleasant as mine.

21:38.590 --> 21:40.000
This is odd.

21:40.091 --> 21:42.958
The Prowler has not initiated
any communications.

21:43.052 --> 21:44.132
Not sending word home?

21:44.220 --> 21:49.089
No. In fact it's maneuvering
as if it wishes to dock.

21:50.310 --> 21:52.050
You don't think...?

21:52.645 --> 21:54.897
No. It couldn't be.

21:55.690 --> 21:57.430
Pilot, let it dock.

21:57.525 --> 21:59.311
Chiana, but don't you...?
-Chiana...?

22:12.248 --> 22:14.910
Yo, Chi! What up?

22:15.001 --> 22:16.957
Stay where you frelling are!

22:20.757 --> 22:23.089
How do I know it's you?

22:23.176 --> 22:24.757
You want to check my birthmarks?

22:27.555 --> 22:29.386
Yeah, maybe.

22:31.935 --> 22:34.677
Uh... Why didn't you signal?

22:34.771 --> 22:38.263
'Cause the bad guys
might be listening.

22:40.360 --> 22:43.852
Okay, so, uh... so what are
you doing with him?

22:44.364 --> 22:46.355
What? This guy?

22:48.368 --> 22:51.155
I'm putting this guy
back in his cell!

22:51.246 --> 22:52.361
(grunts)

23:03.132 --> 23:04.121
Whoa!

23:04.217 --> 23:06.299
( excited laughter)

23:10.598 --> 23:12.259
You survived!

23:12.350 --> 23:14.887
Hey, don't I always?

23:16.813 --> 23:18.269
Hey, blue.

23:23.027 --> 23:24.608
Zhaan.

23:26.239 --> 23:29.151
Hey, darling, can you hear me?

23:29.242 --> 23:30.903
Certainly I can hear you, John.

23:30.994 --> 23:32.905
I can always hear you.

23:32.996 --> 23:34.532
Uh-huh.

23:37.375 --> 23:39.036
You okay?

23:39.127 --> 23:40.708
Perfectly.

23:40.795 --> 23:42.831
You're not...

23:43.673 --> 23:45.379
surprised to see me?

23:45.466 --> 23:47.331
Not at all.

23:50.013 --> 23:52.470
I apologize for shouting
at you, John.

23:52.557 --> 23:54.172
( chuckles )

23:54.267 --> 23:55.302
That's okay.

23:55.393 --> 23:58.135
Um, when exactly was that?

23:58.229 --> 23:59.810
On Litigara.

23:59.897 --> 24:02.309
I accused you of not being
there for me.

24:02.400 --> 24:05.563
I realize now that...
that wasn't true.

24:05.653 --> 24:06.938
Liti...

24:07.655 --> 24:09.065
gara?

24:09.157 --> 24:13.070
I don't think that I've been
there but I'm here now.

24:14.412 --> 24:17.119
Yes. Your spirit is with me.

24:17.206 --> 24:19.618
The flesh is unimportant.

24:19.709 --> 24:21.700
No. It's kind of important.

24:23.588 --> 24:25.124
Whoa!

24:25.214 --> 24:28.377
Oh, ho, oh, I'm not dead.

24:28.468 --> 24:30.550
She thinks I'm dead.

24:30.637 --> 24:32.502
I'm real.

24:33.306 --> 24:34.967
Yes, John.

24:35.058 --> 24:37.720
You always will be to me.

24:45.902 --> 24:47.517
Oh!

24:54.202 --> 24:55.942
( groans )

24:57.955 --> 24:59.115
Uh, what the ah, hell...?

24:59.207 --> 25:01.163
Pilot thinks nothing's wrong.

25:01.250 --> 25:02.114
She's resumed the Delvian Seek.

25:02.210 --> 25:03.666
What... wait. The Del...

25:03.753 --> 25:05.835
Why didn't you tell me? Is this
supposed to be important?

25:05.922 --> 25:07.002
Oh, you tell me.

25:07.090 --> 25:08.580
You've seen more Delvians
than I have.

25:08.675 --> 25:10.666
You think that's a help?

25:15.223 --> 25:17.430
(sighs)

25:18.976 --> 25:20.762
D'Argo:
Oh, tie.

25:20.853 --> 25:24.220
We're low on food. I'd conserve
your energy, if I were you.

25:24.315 --> 25:25.270
For what purpose?

25:25.358 --> 25:27.189
To live longer.

25:27.276 --> 25:30.985
If I am to die on this asteroid,
I would rather it was sooner
than later.

25:31.072 --> 25:33.984
Besides, if I die,
you can eat me.

25:34.075 --> 25:35.565
You don't look ripe to me.

25:35.660 --> 25:38.117
Crichton:
Somebody call for a taxi?

25:38.204 --> 25:39.865
Crichton, you succeeded?

25:39.956 --> 25:43.198
I'm one for two. I'll give you
the details on the way back.

25:43.292 --> 25:45.328
Crichton, you must return now.

25:45.420 --> 25:46.910
Moya's made contact with Talyn.

25:47.004 --> 25:47.993
Where is Talyn?

25:48.089 --> 25:49.954
About to leave the
asteroid field.

25:50.049 --> 25:52.335
We're on the way, Pilot.

25:52.427 --> 25:53.837
There's no mistake, sir.

25:53.928 --> 25:56.510
The gunship is leaving the
asteroid field and Moya
is pursuing.

25:56.597 --> 25:59.384
Follow them, but stay well
clear of their sensor range.

25:59.475 --> 26:04.720
They must not see us, until
they are too far from the
asteroid field to hide again.

26:04.814 --> 26:08.056
But we won't be able to catch
the Leviathan if she Starbursts.

26:08.151 --> 26:11.894
She won't because her
offspring can't.

26:11.988 --> 26:14.855
On my signal, cripple
both ships.

26:14.949 --> 26:19.739
Commando units will take
Crichton alive, but I care for
no other prisoners. Clear?

26:27.462 --> 26:29.168
Sparky!

26:29.255 --> 26:30.995
How's my favorite Hynerian?

26:31.090 --> 26:32.796
(gasping)

26:36.387 --> 26:37.968
Even I'm pleased to see you.

26:38.055 --> 26:40.432
(gasping)

26:42.935 --> 26:45.096
Are, uh... are you not well?

26:45.188 --> 26:46.644
(gasping continues)

26:46.731 --> 26:49.143
Crichton:
You got a frog in your throat?

26:49.233 --> 26:51.189
You need a Hynerian heimlich?

26:54.113 --> 26:55.228
Fine.

26:55.323 --> 26:57.314
I'll be fine.

26:58.117 --> 27:00.403
(gasping)

27:02.246 --> 27:05.158
A slight case of the intons.

27:05.249 --> 27:06.785
The what?

27:06.876 --> 27:10.789
It's a Hynerian airway seizure
caused by very strong emotions.

27:10.880 --> 27:13.838
(laughing)

27:13.925 --> 27:17.213
I didn't know you had strong
emotions in you, Sparky.

27:17.303 --> 27:19.544
Other than greed, of course.

27:19.639 --> 27:24.008
A simple reaction to the shock
of seeing you again.

27:24.101 --> 27:26.717
Pilot:
It is good to have you
all back aboard.

27:26.813 --> 27:28.144
Crichton:
We missed you, too, Pilot.

27:28.231 --> 27:30.187
Very much.
What's Talyn's status?

27:30.274 --> 27:31.684
Highly distraught.

27:31.776 --> 27:35.735
He continues to flee and
won't even acknowledge
Moya's signals.

27:35.822 --> 27:37.278
Pilot, I might have a
little more luck.

27:37.365 --> 27:39.481
ls Moya willing to let me try?

27:40.868 --> 27:42.699
Moya consents.

27:42.787 --> 27:44.152
You may proceed.

27:44.247 --> 27:46.158
Thank you.

27:47.875 --> 27:50.582
Talyn, this is Aeryn.

27:50.670 --> 27:52.456
Please answer.

27:55.800 --> 28:01.215
Talyn, you don't have to run
from Moya. She only wants
to protect you.

28:01.305 --> 28:05.298
Look Talyn, I know you're
confused. You've heard
so many voices.

28:05.393 --> 28:10.228
But you know that I
care about you.

28:10.314 --> 28:13.272
At least let me know that you
can hear what I'm saying.

28:13.359 --> 28:15.850
Hey, you might want to
give it a rest.

28:15.945 --> 28:17.606
Poor kid's confused. He doesn't
know who to listen to.

28:17.697 --> 28:20.484
Moya's still trying to catch
him, which can't be
helping matters.

28:20.575 --> 28:24.067
No. Look, I'm going to go have
a chat with Pilot.

28:30.418 --> 28:31.578
I'm sorry, Commander.

28:31.669 --> 28:33.876
Moya refuses to allow Talyn
to get further away.

28:33.963 --> 28:38.673
Look, does she not realize that
by chasing him, she's making
him more nervous?

28:38.759 --> 28:42.172
She's convinced she can still
get through to him and
talk him down.

28:42.263 --> 28:45.801
Having found him, she's
terrified at the thought of
losing him again.

28:45.892 --> 28:48.554
I know. I know. It's her kid.
It's her kid.

28:48.644 --> 28:52.387
I know that. I know that.
Maybe Morn really
does know best.

28:53.482 --> 28:55.222
There's no sign of the
Command Carrier, right?

28:55.318 --> 28:58.060
None... yet.

28:58.154 --> 29:02.397
(ethereal, rhythmic ringing )

29:06.287 --> 29:08.323
Zhaan?

29:08.414 --> 29:10.200
Hello, Aeryn. Come in.

29:12.084 --> 29:14.370
Crichton said you
were chanting.

29:17.048 --> 29:19.209
Are you finished yet?

29:19.300 --> 29:20.756
I'll never be finished.

29:20.843 --> 29:23.300
This is a different phase
of the Seek.

29:23.387 --> 29:25.252
Right.

29:25.348 --> 29:28.306
Well, I just wanted to see
how you were.

29:28.893 --> 29:29.973
I love you.

29:30.061 --> 29:31.096
You what?

29:31.187 --> 29:32.472
I love you.

29:32.563 --> 29:35.930
Oh, yes, I did hear it the first
time and you know what? I, l...

29:36.025 --> 29:38.732
I love all living beings.

29:38.819 --> 29:43.108
The Seek has reopened my eyes
to the wonder of the spirit.

29:43.199 --> 29:45.986
I am now going to devote my
life to enlightenment.

29:46.077 --> 29:47.487
Oh.

29:48.746 --> 29:51.032
Well, I think that's, um...

29:52.375 --> 29:55.959
really selfish, actually.

29:56.045 --> 29:59.663
You know, before you bliss off
completely into oblivion,

29:59.757 --> 30:01.213
you might want to have a
little look around you,

30:01.300 --> 30:04.337
because Moya and Talyn are in
dangen

30:07.431 --> 30:09.513
Worldly concerns do not
interest me now.

30:09.600 --> 30:13.559
Oh, really? Well, then, don't
give me any dren about how
much you love me.

30:16.107 --> 30:18.439
Love in its most
rarefied sense...

30:18.526 --> 30:20.767
Too rarefied for me.

30:20.861 --> 30:23.147
I'm just an ignorant warrior
who believes that love means

30:23.239 --> 30:27.152
you're willing to fight and die
for your fellow living beings.

30:32.123 --> 30:34.785
(discordant ringing )

30:37.628 --> 30:40.836
You're an atypical Luxan,
Ka D'Argo.

30:40.923 --> 30:48.091
You left your military service
to raise a family upon a
rural planet.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.216
Spare me your disapproval.

30:50.307 --> 30:52.138
ldont

30:52.226 --> 30:56.469
I lived upon a farming community
until the Peacekeepers
conscripted me.

30:56.564 --> 30:59.021
My wife was a Sebacean.

30:59.108 --> 31:01.394
Tell me you approve of that.

31:01.485 --> 31:06.320
No. | find it repellent.

31:06.407 --> 31:09.945
But that reaction, the concept
of irreversible contamination

31:10.036 --> 31:12.118
was instilled in me by
the Peacekeepers.

31:12.204 --> 31:16.823
As such, it needs to be
questioned, re-examined.

31:16.917 --> 31:19.784
A containment cell is a fine
place for reflection.

31:19.879 --> 31:23.792
True. Pa'u Zhaan achieved much
during her incarceration,

31:23.883 --> 31:27.375
but I cannot stay here.

31:27.470 --> 31:30.337
Talyn needs me.

31:30.431 --> 31:32.547
Too frelling bad.

31:33.934 --> 31:37.301
Your hatred of me, though well
earned blinds you.

31:37.396 --> 31:40.980
I can keep Talyn out of
Peacekeeper hands.

31:41.067 --> 31:42.147
And | will.

31:42.234 --> 31:44.316
You're not getting back
aboard Talyn.

31:44.403 --> 31:45.904
Get used to the idea.

31:45.988 --> 31:47.569
Re-examine it.

31:48.866 --> 31:50.447
I shall.

31:52.286 --> 31:56.245
Before you were arrested,

31:56.332 --> 31:59.074
were you happy?

32:01.295 --> 32:03.957
Happier than you can
ever imagine.

32:04.507 --> 32:06.463
Then I envy you.

32:09.345 --> 32:11.757
Braca:
Both Leviathans are
decelerating.

32:11.847 --> 32:15.135
Either they have no
plan whatsoever,

32:15.226 --> 32:20.766
or they're about to implement
one which isn't immediately
apparent.

32:22.650 --> 32:26.643
Our wisest move in both cases
is the same.

32:28.614 --> 32:32.277
Overtake and engage.

32:36.080 --> 32:37.945
Well, don't take your
time or anything.

32:38.040 --> 32:39.371
You're sure it's the
Command Carrier, Pilot?

32:39.458 --> 32:41.699
Yes. Closing fast.

32:41.794 --> 32:44.035
Firing range in 6,000 microts.

32:44.130 --> 32:46.371
Scorpius, he just can't
live without me.

32:46.465 --> 32:47.750
Talyn sees the Carrier.

32:47.842 --> 32:49.878
He's powering up his
main cannon.

32:49.969 --> 32:53.678
Excellent! Have him aim dead
amidships, right in
Scorpius's...

32:53.764 --> 32:56.005
He's aiming for Moya.

32:58.602 --> 33:00.103
Damn it! What the hell's
he doing?

33:00.187 --> 33:02.473
Talyn says that was
a warning shot.

33:02.565 --> 33:04.146
He's sending Moya a demand.

33:04.233 --> 33:05.313
What's he want?

33:05.401 --> 33:08.017
A captain. Talyn's afraid.

33:08.112 --> 33:11.229
He doesn't know what to do about
the approaching Command Carrier.

33:11.323 --> 33:13.109
Oh, like we do?

33:13.200 --> 33:15.111
He insists he needs guidance.

33:15.202 --> 33:18.820
Ouch. Let's get that boy some
guidance before he turns into a
full-blown Menendez brother.

33:18.914 --> 33:20.165
I'll go at once.

33:20.249 --> 33:23.116
Talyn demands that we
send over Crais.
-What?

33:23.210 --> 33:24.825
He said he wants Crais?
-He can't have him.

33:24.920 --> 33:26.660
Pilot, get that boy
on the phone.

33:26.755 --> 33:28.791
He's unwilling to discuss
it further.

33:28.883 --> 33:33.252
He says he'll fire upon us
unless we agree to return
Crais now.

33:33.345 --> 33:34.255
Pilot, evasives.

33:34.346 --> 33:36.507
Moya won't. She doesn't
believe he'll fire.

33:36.599 --> 33:39.682
Pilot, let's get the defense
screen up just in case
mama's wrong.

33:41.353 --> 33:43.810
Done. But it may not hold.

33:58.746 --> 34:01.658
Man, haven't you people
ever heard of fuses?

34:01.749 --> 34:05.162
Moya's unhurt, but the
defense screen is out.

34:05.252 --> 34:06.833
No? Really?

34:06.921 --> 34:10.163
And another shot would do Moya
considerable harm.

34:10.257 --> 34:14.341
Scorpius will be upon us in
no more than 5,000 microts.

34:16.263 --> 34:18.640
I'm going to take Crais
to Talyn.

34:19.683 --> 34:20.718
And then what?

34:20.809 --> 34:22.936
We leave Talyn in
Crais' control?

34:23.020 --> 34:26.308
His and mine. I'll stay aboard
Talyn with Crais.

34:26.398 --> 34:28.184
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

34:28.275 --> 34:29.435
For how long?

34:29.526 --> 34:32.188
For as long as necessary
to protect Talyn.

34:32.279 --> 34:33.610
He's very intelligent, John.

34:33.697 --> 34:35.813
Once he matures, he'll no
longer want a captain.

34:35.908 --> 34:37.398
Yeah, but Aeryn in the
meantime...

34:37.493 --> 34:40.826
I'll be there to mitigate any
damage that Crais does.

34:42.623 --> 34:44.329
Crais is never going to
go for that.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.327
Yes, he will.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.500
He's already offered to
take me with him.

34:55.344 --> 34:56.675
And you'd do that?

34:56.762 --> 34:58.218
I don't have another choice.

34:58.305 --> 35:00.466
There are always choices,
Aeryn.

35:00.557 --> 35:04.846
The only other choice is death
for everyone, Talyn included.

35:04.937 --> 35:06.347
Well, I'm not going to let
you go with him.

35:06.438 --> 35:08.269
There isn't another solution.

35:08.357 --> 35:10.097
There has to be.

35:11.151 --> 35:13.233
We're out of time.

35:15.197 --> 35:16.812
Aeryn.

35:21.120 --> 35:22.451
Your nephew wants to see you.

35:22.538 --> 35:24.153
(grunts)

35:26.750 --> 35:29.662
I knew he would, eventually.

35:32.131 --> 35:34.167
Officer Sun,

35:36.051 --> 35:37.507
make your choice.

35:39.013 --> 35:40.378
I want to go with you.

35:42.391 --> 35:43.722
Crichton,

35:43.809 --> 35:48.849
this is a beneficial turn of
events for all concerned,

35:48.939 --> 35:53.524
with the happy exception
of Scorpius.

35:53.610 --> 35:57.979
Crais, I don't like this plan
and I never will.

35:58.073 --> 36:03.193
So you better behave yourself
with Talyn and Aeryn.

36:05.247 --> 36:07.784
'Cause if you hurt either
one of them,

36:11.253 --> 36:14.336
I'm going to hunt you down.

36:14.423 --> 36:16.584
You hunt me down.

36:18.344 --> 36:22.007
That would complete the
symmetry nicely, wouldn't it?

36:46.372 --> 36:50.035
Last time we stood here,
we didn't say goodbye.

36:50.125 --> 36:52.662
And it wasn't goodbye,
as it turned out.

37:02.429 --> 37:05.136
Here's hoping history
repeats itself.

37:25.786 --> 37:28.744
Talyn, we have returned.

37:28.831 --> 37:30.992
We are prepared to guide you
out of danger,

37:31.083 --> 37:33.199
take you far from the domain
of the Peacekeepers.

37:33.293 --> 37:37.377
Maneuver very close to Moya and
her Starburst will carry us
all to safety.

37:41.135 --> 37:42.295
What is that?

37:43.429 --> 37:45.260
It's the Hand of Friendship.

37:45.347 --> 37:48.009
It's the greatest honor
it can bestow.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.640
Talyn...

37:54.731 --> 37:56.187
who's it for?

37:56.275 --> 38:00.268
( beeping )

38:04.533 --> 38:06.398
Thank you.

38:07.035 --> 38:09.412
I humbly accept.

38:12.249 --> 38:14.410
No, Talyn.

38:17.004 --> 38:18.289
Talyn.

38:21.842 --> 38:23.082
( screaming )

38:23.177 --> 38:24.917
Talyn, what's happening?

38:27.306 --> 38:29.467
Talyn, what have you done?

38:29.558 --> 38:31.890
What is that?

38:31.977 --> 38:34.844
A neural transponder.

38:36.982 --> 38:41.271
A direct interface with Talyn.

38:41.361 --> 38:42.521
His senses...

38:42.613 --> 38:44.319
his propulsors...

38:45.073 --> 38:46.358
his weaponry.

38:46.450 --> 38:48.441
I command them all.

38:48.535 --> 38:50.400
You command him?

38:50.496 --> 38:52.032
Every system.

38:52.122 --> 38:53.578
It's indescribable.

38:53.665 --> 38:55.496
It's a pity you can't
experience it.

38:55.584 --> 39:00.328
Crais, we were going to share
command of Talyn.
-Talyn chose otherwise.

39:00.422 --> 39:01.582
He needs both of us.

39:01.673 --> 39:03.880
No.

39:03.967 --> 39:05.878
We no longer need you.

39:05.969 --> 39:07.880
Talyn can only have one master.

39:07.971 --> 39:09.086
You may return to Moya.

39:09.181 --> 39:10.842
I will not.

39:10.933 --> 39:12.139
You must.

39:12.226 --> 39:15.093
He and I are of like mind
on this.

39:16.813 --> 39:19.270
Crais, take that thing off.

39:21.652 --> 39:24.189
Take it off.

39:24.279 --> 39:26.361
Take it off or I will!

39:33.205 --> 39:34.536
( laser firing )

39:44.424 --> 39:45.880
(firing)

39:57.437 --> 39:59.894
Talyn, I'm not the enemy.

39:59.982 --> 40:01.267
We know that.

40:01.358 --> 40:03.269
But you cannot stay
aboard here.

40:03.360 --> 40:06.818
You have 50 microts to get
back to your Prowler

40:06.905 --> 40:10.614
before we open that
passageway into space.

40:10.701 --> 40:13.113
Good health, Officer Sun.

40:13.203 --> 40:16.695
Pilot, why hasn't Talyn
tucked in close?
We need a Starburst damn soon.

40:16.790 --> 40:20.282
In 90 microts. The Carrier
will be in range to fire.

40:20.377 --> 40:21.366
Then what's keeping them?

40:21.461 --> 40:24.168
The Prowler has just
emerged from Talyn.

40:24.256 --> 40:26.121
Who's aboard?

40:26.216 --> 40:27.956
Officer Sun.

40:28.051 --> 40:30.167
She's asking to return to Moya.

40:30.262 --> 40:32.503
Pilot, get her aboard fast.

40:32.598 --> 40:34.714
Scorpius:
40 more microts.

40:34.808 --> 40:38.266
Braca:
Charging all frag cannons.
Boarding parties standing by.

40:38.353 --> 40:40.309
Fire when at optimal range.

40:40.397 --> 40:41.887
Crais:
Scorpius.

40:41.982 --> 40:44.098
My final progress report.

40:44.192 --> 40:45.853
Stay that command.

40:45.944 --> 40:49.562
The gunship is secured,

40:49.656 --> 40:53.615
and I am resigning my
Peacekeeper commission
effective immediately.

40:53.702 --> 40:57.160
Crais, cease this nonsense.

40:57.247 --> 40:58.748
As for Crichton,

40:58.832 --> 41:00.163
he is dead.

41:00.250 --> 41:02.992
I killed him with my
bare hands.

41:03.086 --> 41:05.122
My brother is avenged.

41:05.213 --> 41:08.125
Here ends my report, Captain.

41:08.216 --> 41:09.205
( growls )

41:09.301 --> 41:11.883
Fire upon both Leviathans.

41:23.231 --> 41:24.562
Chiana:
Starburst?

41:24.650 --> 41:26.060
I thought Talyn wasn't ready.

41:26.151 --> 41:28.483
He obviously learns a lot
faster than we thought.

41:28.570 --> 41:30.071
Pilot, is the Prowler aboard?

41:30.155 --> 41:33.318
Yes. Prepare for immediate
Starburst.

41:43.627 --> 41:45.618
Lieutenant.

41:46.546 --> 41:51.461
Your tactical expert claimed...

41:51.551 --> 41:55.169
the gunship's ability
to Starburst...

41:55.263 --> 41:58.676
would not mature for an arn.

41:58.767 --> 42:04.137
Send him to me so I might
educate him.

42:04.231 --> 42:06.973
Yes, sir.

42:07.067 --> 42:11.185
Start searching for Moya,
on her most probable
Starburst vectors.

42:11.279 --> 42:12.564
Not the gunship, sir?

42:12.656 --> 42:14.317
After all, with
Crichton dead...

42:14.408 --> 42:17.195
Crichton isn't dead.

42:17.285 --> 42:21.198
That's merely Crais' small
attempt to take revenge upon me.

42:21.289 --> 42:22.540
How can you be so sure?

42:22.624 --> 42:27.209
If Crais had killed Crichton,
he wouldn't tell me.

42:27.295 --> 42:30.162
Crichton is alive!

42:30.257 --> 42:32.339
And I will find him.

42:45.105 --> 42:48.597
If you are going to sit there
in a coma, you could at
least smile.

42:53.405 --> 42:56.067
Sweet D'Argo.

42:56.158 --> 42:58.240
I wasjust thinking.

42:59.411 --> 43:01.697
Part of the Seek?

43:01.788 --> 43:04.279
No, Aeryn was right.

43:04.374 --> 43:10.085
As much as I wish to immerse
myself in the Seek and in the
next level of existence,

43:10.172 --> 43:13.289
I cannot abandon you all.

43:15.427 --> 43:18.214
I will slow down the Seek.

43:19.931 --> 43:22.138
The next level will
always there.

43:22.225 --> 43:25.683
This one will not.

43:25.771 --> 43:28.854
Then we must cherish it
while we have it.

43:28.940 --> 43:31.101
And we must cherish each other.

43:35.238 --> 43:37.775
I failed.

43:37.866 --> 43:39.822
Well, you did everything
you could.

43:39.910 --> 43:42.743
In other words, I failed.

43:42.829 --> 43:44.785
Pilot:
Officer Sun,

43:44.873 --> 43:49.333
Talyn told Moya he was choosing
Crais of his own volition.

43:49.419 --> 43:52.377
Yeah. For what that's worth.

43:52.464 --> 43:57.049
He'll contact her from time to
time and let her know he's okay.

43:57.135 --> 44:01.378
Well, they say they'll call
home, Pilot, once a week.

44:01.473 --> 44:03.088
They never do.

44:06.603 --> 44:10.095
Talyn will be all right,
won't he?

44:10.190 --> 44:13.603
Well, he's young,

44:13.693 --> 44:16.685
and he's going to make mistakes.

44:16.780 --> 44:19.146
But he'll learn.

44:19.241 --> 44:22.654
And if Crais ever mistreats
him, he'll bounce him.

44:22.744 --> 44:25.281
Maybe Crais won't mistreat him.

44:25.372 --> 44:27.328
He could have killed me,
you know.

44:27.415 --> 44:29.622
He could have killed all
of us and he didn't.

44:29.709 --> 44:34.248
Yeah. Maybe he just needed to
save the energy for Starburst.

44:34.339 --> 44:37.297
Or maybe he's changed.

44:39.177 --> 44:44.092
Well, you do believe people can
change, don't you, John?

44:46.810 --> 44:48.050
( chuckles )

44:48.144 --> 44:49.520
Well?

44:51.106 --> 44:54.894
Well, you have.

44:54.985 --> 44:56.521
Mmm?
-Mm-hmm.

44:56.611 --> 44:57.566
I have.

44:57.654 --> 44:59.019
Mm-hmm.

45:00.699 --> 45:02.906
But Crais?
