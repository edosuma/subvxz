WEBVTT

00:21.375 --> 00:22.750
Where the hell have you been?

00:22.834 --> 00:24.250
You are 20 minutes
late and this is
our

00:24.333 --> 00:25.792
first actual
press for this
campaign.

00:25.875 --> 00:27.792
I'll make it up to him.

00:27.875 --> 00:30.417
It's gonna take a little more
than just a charming smile,
Dex.

00:30.500 --> 00:32.208
what
on your feet?'

00:32.291 --> 00:33.417
You told me to buy the suit.

00:33.500 --> 00:35.125
You didn't say anything
about the shoes.

00:37.166 --> 00:38.500
Sorry to hold you up.

00:38.583 --> 00:40.083
I was at the community center.

00:40.166 --> 00:42.583
Yeah, runnin' that center
must
certainly get culture shock

00:42.667 --> 00:44.333
compared to corporate
litigation, eh?

00:44.417 --> 00:45.500
No comparison.

00:45.583 --> 00:47.166
What I do now matters.

00:47.250 --> 00:48.709
So, uh, what made you decide

00:48.792 --> 00:50.792
to jump into the tar
pit
of municipal
politics?

00:50.875 --> 00:53.125
- 'Watch out!'
- Oh!

00:57.083 --> 00:59.750
(Dex)
Gonna have to get you boys
a real hoop one of these
days.

00:59.834 --> 01:00.917
Sorry about
that Dex is

01:01.000 --> 01:02.625
really dedicated
to the kids down here.

01:02.709 --> 01:03.917
He's gonna need
more dedication

01:04.000 --> 01:05.583
to knock Grover Boone
off his perch.

01:05.667 --> 01:08.250
Your guy has got no name,
no connections, and no
money.

01:08.333 --> 01:10.458
Well, he's got
something better..

01:10.542 --> 01:11.875
(Dex)
Hey, Eric.

01:11.959 --> 01:13.375
...heart.

01:13.458 --> 01:15.792
They move your brother
out of the ICU yet?

01:15.875 --> 01:17.417
I'm keeping him
in my prayers.

01:17.500 --> 01:19.500
You need anything,
you come see me, you hear?

01:23.834 --> 01:26.959
This boy Eric's older brother
was walking home

01:27.041 --> 01:28.458
the other night,
caught a stray bullet.

01:28.542 --> 01:30.917
Local dealers flexing
muscle at each other.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.917
(male #1)
'Happens every
day out here.'

01:33.000 --> 01:35.375
It doesn't make it right,
though, does it?

01:35.458 --> 01:37.000
'So to answer your question.'

01:37.083 --> 01:38.583
That's why I'm running
for city council.

01:38.667 --> 01:40.709
Sixth Street is the biggest
drug
market in North Philly.

01:40.792 --> 01:42.792
Cops can't stop it.
Boone can't stop it.

01:42.875 --> 01:44.875
What are you gonna
do about it?

01:47.542 --> 01:50.166
I'm gonna shut
the whole thing down.

02:05.458 --> 02:07.750
(woman on TV)
'In other news,
police sources said today'

02:07.834 --> 02:10.250
'that murdered city council
hopeful, Dexter Collins'

02:10.333 --> 02:12.041
'was in possession
of a significant amount'

02:12.125 --> 02:13.625
'of crack cocaine'

02:13.709 --> 02:16.041
'strengthening speculation
that the anti-drug candidate'

02:16.125 --> 02:18.542
'struggled with an addiction
that led to his death'

02:18.625 --> 02:21.000
'just five days
before the election.'

02:27.125 --> 02:29.208
Bleedin' ulcers, man.

02:29.291 --> 02:30.834
I haven't eaten in days.

02:30.917 --> 02:33.125
The prison
doctors
are useless.

02:33.208 --> 02:34.417
I can't take
it anymore.

02:34.500 --> 02:35.709
That's something
you should've considered

02:35.792 --> 02:37.375
before
five liquor stores.

02:37.458 --> 02:39.250
Show some holiday
spirit, man.

02:39.333 --> 02:40.875
I'm looking at 15 years.

02:40.959 --> 02:43.166
We're looking at a three-hour
drive back to Philly.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.542
Lawyer said you got
something to give?

02:44.625 --> 02:47.166
You know that
after-hours
joint on Susky?

02:47.250 --> 02:48.875
The Red Rooster?

02:48.959 --> 02:50.166
Got it on
good
authority

02:50.250 --> 02:53.083
a lot of those
waitresses are
pros.

02:55.333 --> 02:57.583
- What? You're leaving?
- We're homicide, Luther.

02:57.667 --> 02:59.458
We deal in bodies,
not hookers.

02:59.542 --> 03:00.792
You're as dumb
as you look if you

03:00.875 --> 03:02.458
think that weak crap
is gonna to fly.

03:02.542 --> 03:03.625
I was just warming up.

03:03.709 --> 03:05.417
I'll see
you
in 15.

03:05.500 --> 03:07.250
Dexter Collins?

03:09.125 --> 03:10.250
What about him?

03:10.333 --> 03:12.166
'He didn't get
killed by no drugs.'

03:12.250 --> 03:14.250
He was assassinated.

03:14.333 --> 03:16.667
- Sixth Street Mafia.
- And you witnessed this?

03:16.750 --> 03:18.166
A crackhead up
at Graterford told me

03:18.250 --> 03:21.250
on the cell block,
when I serving my last bit.

03:21.333 --> 03:23.083
He saw the whole thing go down.

03:23.166 --> 03:24.709
Let's talk
to the smokehound.

03:24.792 --> 03:26.917
Dead. TB.
Last year.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.458
Happen to ID the doer
before he died?

03:28.542 --> 03:30.125
He said he didn't get
a good look.

03:30.208 --> 03:31.333
Aw, that's great, Luther

03:31.417 --> 03:32.834
second-hand BS
from a dead
witness.

03:32.917 --> 03:34.250
Any more garbage
you wanna peddle?

03:34.333 --> 03:35.959
- Hey.
- 'The gun they used.'

03:36.041 --> 03:37.500
.40 caliber SIG?

03:38.875 --> 03:41.625
Y'all ever find it?

03:41.709 --> 03:43.166
What's your point?

03:45.750 --> 03:48.291
I know where it is.

03:52.667 --> 03:55.083
(Scotty)
'Nah, there's nothing here.'

03:55.166 --> 03:56.792
Wait a minute.

03:58.375 --> 03:59.625
Aw.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.875
.40 caliber SIG Sauer.

04:11.959 --> 04:14.542
Guess Luther's not as dumb
as he looks.

04:48.917 --> 04:51.667
(Will)
'Dexter Collins, found shot
to death on Sixth Street'

04:51.750 --> 04:52.834
2:00 in the morning.

04:52.917 --> 04:54.875
Looked like a drug deal
gone bad.

04:54.959 --> 04:56.959
He was 30 years old,
raised in the badlands

04:57.041 --> 04:59.500
full ride at Penn, Yale Law,
then Wall Street.

04:59.583 --> 05:00.875
The guy was a lightweight.

05:00.959 --> 05:02.375
'He gave it up
to be a community activist'

05:02.458 --> 05:04.792
ran for city council,
said he was gonna

05:04.875 --> 05:06.208
take on the drug dealers.

05:06.291 --> 05:08.583
Anti-drug candidate
found shot to death

05:08.667 --> 05:10.583
with a crack pipe
and a fistful of vials.

05:10.667 --> 05:12.750
You know, the crack thing
never jibed to me.

05:12.834 --> 05:14.208
'He was a reformer.'

05:14.291 --> 05:15.625
'Refused to take
street money.'

05:15.709 --> 05:18.166
Said he was gonna earn
votes, not buy them.

05:18.250 --> 05:19.917
Now, ward bosses
must've loved that.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.709
Newspapers went to town
after his death.

05:21.792 --> 05:23.083
Called him
the crackhead candidate.

05:23.166 --> 05:24.542
But they never reported this

05:24.625 --> 05:25.583
"the autopsy didn't find

05:25.667 --> 05:27.208
"any drugs in Dex's system."

05:27.291 --> 05:29.000
(Will)
'Maybe he hadn't used
in a while?'

05:29.083 --> 05:30.542
Or maybe the drugs were planted.

05:30.625 --> 05:32.875
- Frame job?
- This was a nasty campaign.

05:32.959 --> 05:35.083
Dex was giving Grover Boone
a run for his money.

05:35.166 --> 05:36.750
Like 30 years on
the city council?

05:36.834 --> 05:39.417
Boone would eat his own
children to hold on to his
seat.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.375
(Will)
'Commissioner created
a task force'

05:41.458 --> 05:42.959
to solve Dex's murder.

05:43.041 --> 05:44.792
Two dozen cops, handpicked

05:44.875 --> 05:46.792
hardly any homicide experience.

05:46.875 --> 05:48.458
Guess how
that went.

05:48.542 --> 05:50.083
So, let's look
into Luther's story.

05:50.166 --> 05:51.917
The gun we found is a match
as the murder weapon

05:52.000 --> 05:54.333
but there's nothing connecting
it to the Sixth Street Mafia.

05:54.417 --> 05:57.166
We need more on Dex Collins
than news reports and rumors.

05:57.250 --> 05:59.583
- 'Who was close to him?'
- The father, Ronnie Collins.

05:59.667 --> 06:01.125
Raised Dex by himself.

06:01.208 --> 06:04.417
And also his campaign manager,
Cassie Michaels.

06:04.500 --> 06:05.625
We'll re-interview them

06:05.709 --> 06:07.166
but let's not rattle
too many cages

06:07.250 --> 06:09.917
until we know
what we're goin' at.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.667
I'm going to meet
the campaign manager.

06:16.750 --> 06:20.458
Something I got to take care of.

06:20.542 --> 06:22.750
"Cooper." Who's that?

06:22.834 --> 06:24.333
I keep getting
my neighbor's
mail.

06:24.417 --> 06:27.208
You might want to stop
by the post office.

06:34.709 --> 06:36.583
Check it out
9 o'clock.

06:37.709 --> 06:40.333
(Scotty)
'Oh, not bad.'

06:40.417 --> 06:42.875
You think I got a chance
at something like that?

06:42.959 --> 06:44.625
Absolutely.

06:44.709 --> 06:46.208
Yeah.

06:52.792 --> 06:55.959
- Hey, you.
- How's it going, Frankie?

06:56.041 --> 06:59.250
Oh, you know,
busy working on my swing.

06:59.333 --> 07:00.959
- Yep.
- Listen, I gotta jet.

07:01.041 --> 07:02.917
Um, see you later?

07:04.750 --> 07:06.500
- I'm sorry.
- See ya.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.166
You're an ass.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.709
Dex was special.

07:23.792 --> 07:25.375
We met in law school
and I could tell

07:25.458 --> 07:27.500
he was going places,
so I jumped at the chance

07:27.583 --> 07:28.875
to work on his campaign.

07:28.959 --> 07:31.333
That must've been a shock,
the way he died

07:31.417 --> 07:32.750
'murdered in
the street like that?'

07:32.834 --> 07:34.500
Couple questions
that never got resolved

07:34.583 --> 07:36.625
Dex's involvement
with drugs for one.

07:36.709 --> 07:38.583
Dex never so much
as took a drink

07:38.667 --> 07:40.542
as long as I knew him.

07:40.625 --> 07:41.959
'I was his
campaign manager.'

07:42.041 --> 07:44.041
My job was knowing
about his skeletons

07:44.125 --> 07:45.291
and he didn't have any.

07:45.375 --> 07:46.583
Sounds too good to be true.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.041
Well, it's too good
for this city.

07:48.125 --> 07:49.000
Meanin'?

07:49.083 --> 07:50.542
'Philly's political machine'

07:50.625 --> 07:52.583
has been in place forever,
if you wanna run for office

07:52.667 --> 07:54.291
then you need name recognition.

07:54.375 --> 07:56.291
So you pay the ward
leaders, in cash.

07:56.375 --> 07:58.625
- To go spread the good word.
- Street money.

07:58.709 --> 08:01.333
Ostensibly it
goes to expenses
but

08:01.417 --> 08:02.875
mostly it just goes
into their pockets.

08:02.959 --> 08:05.667
Dex refused to do that,
so he made some enemies.

08:05.750 --> 08:06.875
Any of these enemies the type

08:06.959 --> 08:08.542
who'd shoot Dex,
plant drugs on him?

08:08.625 --> 08:12.709
In my business, we
specialize
in character assassination.

08:12.792 --> 08:13.917
Not the other kind.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.333
So explain what Dex was doing

08:15.417 --> 08:16.834
on a known drug corner

08:16.917 --> 08:19.375
dead of night,
if it wasn't for drugs.

08:19.458 --> 08:21.583
He was on a mission.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.250
(Dex)
'Let's get real.'

08:24.333 --> 08:27.125
The drug war is
over,
we lost.

08:28.166 --> 08:32.583
There's a boy, 16-years-old

08:32.667 --> 08:34.417
'who was shot by drug dealers'

08:34.500 --> 08:36.750
died in ICU last night.

08:36.834 --> 08:39.500
'His 12-year-old brother
cried in my arms'

08:39.583 --> 08:41.750
asked me why.

08:41.834 --> 08:45.000
'I couldn't tell him that's
just how it is on Sixth
Street.'

08:45.083 --> 08:47.333
I couldn't say,
our district leader

08:47.417 --> 08:49.000
Grover Boone, is too busy

08:49.083 --> 08:51.417
hosting parties
for real estate developers

08:51.500 --> 08:54.083
to be accountable
for the blood on our street.

08:57.291 --> 08:59.583
I need to answer
that boy's question.

09:02.125 --> 09:04.291
Give me a chance.

09:04.375 --> 09:07.125
Sign my petition
to be added to the ballot

09:07.208 --> 09:11.125
and I swear to you,
I will always be here

09:11.208 --> 09:12.542
and accountable.

09:16.208 --> 09:18.291
Your name's
Warren, right?

09:18.375 --> 09:21.667
Own the Diamond Diner.
What's wrong?

09:21.750 --> 09:23.125
I don't need an outsider
telling me

09:23.208 --> 09:24.875
what it's like on my own street.

09:24.959 --> 09:27.250
I'm not an outsider.

09:27.333 --> 09:28.667
I grew up here.

09:28.750 --> 09:30.625
Live here now,
just down the block.

09:30.709 --> 09:34.959
Well, you sure as hell didn't
get that suit on Sixth Street.

09:36.875 --> 09:38.041
Come on.

09:38.875 --> 09:40.041
Come on.

09:50.166 --> 09:52.917
Um, I, uh..

09:54.125 --> 09:57.333
I assure you I, uh, plan
to take better care

09:57.417 --> 10:00.959
of our district
than I do of my apartment.

10:01.041 --> 10:02.750
What's this about?

10:04.000 --> 10:06.625
Uh...my dad.

10:06.709 --> 10:08.417
'Some of you
may know him.'

10:08.500 --> 10:10.834
Ronnie Collins.

10:10.917 --> 10:13.083
'Every morning
he's woken up'

10:14.291 --> 10:16.834
knowin' he'd have
to push a mop all day.

10:16.917 --> 10:19.750
But he's had faith each day

10:19.834 --> 10:23.333
his hard work was
going to pay off.

10:23.417 --> 10:25.500
That faith gave me
a better life.

10:25.583 --> 10:27.208
'So every morning,
I wake up'

10:27.291 --> 10:31.166
I look in the mirror,
and I see faith.

10:32.291 --> 10:35.417
'I know I can do
the same for you.'

10:35.500 --> 10:37.917
All I need is
your signature.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.542
Do you remember
those signs painted

10:51.625 --> 10:54.000
on sidewalks and bus shelters?

10:54.083 --> 10:55.834
Yeah, faith.
They were everywhere.

10:55.917 --> 10:57.500
(Cassie)
'You know, it wasn't
even us who did that?'

10:57.583 --> 11:00.959
Dex's supporters did it
themselves.

11:01.041 --> 11:02.583
End of the day,
it wasn't power

11:02.667 --> 11:04.041
or politics
for Dex.

11:04.125 --> 11:07.041
All he cared about was
that damn street.

11:08.834 --> 11:11.375
And he paid for it
with his life.

11:12.542 --> 11:14.375
Got a hit on
the murder weapon,
boss.

11:14.458 --> 11:16.834
Registered in '04
to a Jay Quincy

11:16.917 --> 11:18.291
a truck
driver
in Chester.

11:18.375 --> 11:20.083
Reported the gun
stolen
with a couple others

11:20.166 --> 11:21.709
a few weeks
before Dex's
death.

11:21.792 --> 11:23.250
He's done
it before,
too.

11:23.333 --> 11:24.750
Once in Jersey,
twice in
Delaware.

11:24.834 --> 11:26.750
- A straw purchaser.
- Lowest of the low.

11:26.834 --> 11:29.000
Reports guns stolen
and
sells them on the
street.

11:29.083 --> 11:30.583
Figure he
sold
to Dex's
killer.

11:30.667 --> 11:33.667
Maybe one of
the Sixth Street Mafia.

11:33.750 --> 11:36.041
Last cops I talked
to were a joke.

11:36.125 --> 11:37.917
They already made up
their minds about him.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.542
They didn't even know
what he was about.

11:39.625 --> 11:41.583
You and your son
pretty
tight, Mr. Collins?

11:41.667 --> 11:44.667
Put everything into Dex.

11:44.750 --> 11:46.291
You understand, I..

11:46.375 --> 11:49.500
I wanted him
to have opportunity

11:49.583 --> 11:51.458
get him away from here.

11:51.542 --> 11:52.834
But he came home.

11:52.917 --> 11:54.125
Said he wanted
to change the way

11:54.208 --> 11:55.917
things worked
on the streets.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.125
Who was I to tell him the
street
wasn't worth the trouble?

11:58.208 --> 12:00.083
He was going
after the
dealers.

12:00.166 --> 12:03.583
Only one who had guts enough
to stand up to 'em.

12:05.208 --> 12:07.375
What was his reward?

12:07.458 --> 12:10.834
Called him
the crackhead candidate.

12:12.417 --> 12:15.417
Guess that sells
more papers than..

12:15.500 --> 12:16.875
...faith.

12:16.959 --> 12:19.500
Taking a look at
the Sixth Street
Mafia.

12:19.583 --> 12:21.458
- It's about time.
- Why is that?

12:21.542 --> 12:24.917
Dex was out there every night
trying to save folks

12:25.000 --> 12:28.333
and those gangsters
didn't like it one damn bit.

12:31.709 --> 12:33.417
(Dex)
'Hey, friend,
can I talk to you?'

12:33.500 --> 12:36.250
Listen, man, you don't have
to be doing this.

12:36.333 --> 12:38.375
Saying you're not alone.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.166
Hey, take my card,
come see me.

12:40.250 --> 12:41.583
'We can help you
get clean'

12:41.667 --> 12:43.875
'give you options.'

12:52.750 --> 12:54.291
You best start movin'.

12:56.667 --> 12:58.125
I ain't even playing.

12:59.625 --> 13:01.208
I know you.

13:01.291 --> 13:02.792
'Victor Nash.'

13:02.875 --> 13:04.667
- 'We grew up together.'
- 'Yeah, so?'

13:04.750 --> 13:07.333
My dad helped us set up
that car wash, remember?

13:07.417 --> 13:10.417
Two bucks a car. Thought we
were some regular Trumps.

13:10.500 --> 13:13.542
Look, 'cause we
know each other

13:13.625 --> 13:15.667
I'm gonna give you a pass.

13:15.750 --> 13:16.875
Go home.

13:16.959 --> 13:18.917
'Now.'

13:19.000 --> 13:21.417
I won't go
until all of you go first.

13:21.500 --> 13:22.959
How you plan on
pulling that off?

13:23.041 --> 13:25.208
You strapped?

13:25.291 --> 13:27.166
I don't got a gun.

13:28.792 --> 13:30.917
'I got faith.'

13:31.000 --> 13:33.750
But see, I got a gun.

13:36.542 --> 13:37.959
Yeah?

13:38.041 --> 13:39.709
But you won't use it.

13:44.583 --> 13:46.709
Victor Nash was..

13:46.792 --> 13:49.041
...a screwup from
the age of ten.

13:49.125 --> 13:51.166
Dex saw something there
worth saving.

13:52.750 --> 13:54.792
For a while,
it looked like he was right.

13:54.875 --> 13:56.000
Victor left the corner?

13:56.083 --> 13:58.500
Did odd jobs
at the campaign office.

13:58.583 --> 14:00.291
But I never
trusted him myself.

14:00.375 --> 14:02.834
You don't just walk away
from a gang like Sixth Street.

14:02.917 --> 14:05.750
And after Dex died,
Victor went right back to
them.

14:05.834 --> 14:08.000
No questions asked.

14:29.834 --> 14:31.667
Yeah, Scotty.

14:32.667 --> 14:33.750
Traffic hour.

14:33.834 --> 14:36.083
I'll meet you on Sixth Street.

14:40.834 --> 14:42.083
Hey.

14:43.750 --> 14:45.417
This a private game?

14:45.500 --> 14:47.000
(Scotty)
'Relax, folks.'

14:47.083 --> 14:48.542
Just looking
for someone.

14:56.291 --> 14:58.667
- 'Hey, Victor.'
- I didn't do nothing.

14:58.750 --> 15:01.166
Besides slinging rock,
guns, agg assault?

15:01.250 --> 15:02.458
That's all in the past?

15:02.542 --> 15:03.875
One of those early
achievers, I guess.

15:03.959 --> 15:05.291
(Victor)
Hey, why y'all
hassling me?

15:05.375 --> 15:07.834
- 'Dex Collins.'
- I can't help you.

15:07.917 --> 15:09.667
(Scotty)
'Now, see, that's
not how this works.'

15:09.750 --> 15:12.083
We ask questions,
then you lie.

15:12.166 --> 15:13.375
Whoops, a gun.

15:13.458 --> 15:15.917
This the one
you pulled on Dex?

15:16.000 --> 15:17.458
That was a misunderstanding.

15:17.542 --> 15:19.834
Like hanging around his
campaign
just before you popped him?

15:19.917 --> 15:21.417
Where were you, huh,
the night he got shot?

15:21.500 --> 15:23.166
- I was at an NA meeting.
- Yeah.

15:23.250 --> 15:25.291
I was all messed up,
I was getting high

15:25.375 --> 15:27.792
half hoping
to get busted or dead.

15:27.875 --> 15:29.417
He helped me.

15:29.500 --> 15:31.166
Come on, Victor.
Still a soldier.

15:31.250 --> 15:32.458
Sixth Street was losing business

15:32.542 --> 15:34.083
with his nightly visits
to the corner.

15:34.166 --> 15:35.083
'Dex reached out
to you'

15:35.166 --> 15:37.000
and you put one in his chest.

15:37.083 --> 15:38.250
Sixth Street was nothing

15:38.333 --> 15:41.041
compared to who
was really after Dex.

15:52.125 --> 15:53.500
Is all this really necessary?

15:53.583 --> 15:55.875
Yes. Dex, I have every member

15:55.959 --> 15:57.834
of the district
coming here today.

15:57.917 --> 15:59.417
'I have ward leaders
and clergy'

15:59.500 --> 16:00.667
'most of them
expecting'

16:00.750 --> 16:02.125
more than just a free meal.

16:02.208 --> 16:03.542
I'm not paying for votes.

16:03.625 --> 16:05.792
'Then, you need to
convince them to support you.'

16:05.875 --> 16:07.458
Dex, champagne's
gonna help with that.

16:07.542 --> 16:10.041
I should be out on the
corner,
not kissing political ass.

16:10.125 --> 16:12.959
You need to do both.

16:13.041 --> 16:14.458
Dex, look,
I think that you

16:14.542 --> 16:18.125
actually have a shot here,
okay,
so just straighten this tie

16:18.208 --> 16:20.625
and put on a smile.

16:20.709 --> 16:22.583
It's only gonna hurt a little.

16:30.542 --> 16:31.834
What's going on?

16:33.834 --> 16:34.917
Warren Wilson..

16:35.000 --> 16:36.250
I'm Lieutenant Doherty.

16:36.333 --> 16:37.709
This is notification
that you're shut down

16:37.792 --> 16:39.709
for health
violations
pending review.

16:39.792 --> 16:41.250
The inspector
was here two months ago.

16:41.333 --> 16:42.458
There weren't any problems.

16:42.542 --> 16:43.625
You'll have to
take that up
with

16:43.709 --> 16:45.375
the Health
Department, assuming

16:45.458 --> 16:46.917
you have a liquor license.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.917
We're hosting a
private
party here tonight

16:49.000 --> 16:50.250
expecting 150 guests.

16:50.333 --> 16:52.750
Not anymore,
building's
only zoned for 70.

16:52.834 --> 16:54.250
(Cassie)
'Oh, are you the
fire marshal, too'

16:54.333 --> 16:55.625
or just Boone's
hatchet man?

16:55.709 --> 16:57.542
Cassie, it's okay.

16:57.625 --> 16:59.417
He's only doing
what he's told.

16:59.500 --> 17:01.417
Isn't that
right,
lieutenant?

17:01.500 --> 17:03.250
(man on PA)
'Send the rich boy home.'

17:03.333 --> 17:04.750
'Vote Grover Boone.'

17:04.834 --> 17:06.875
'He stands alone.'

17:06.959 --> 17:09.375
'Send the rich boy home.'

17:09.458 --> 17:10.750
'Vote Grover Boone.'

17:10.834 --> 17:12.542
'He stands alone.'

17:12.625 --> 17:15.250
Boone is like any
other gangster in the street.

17:15.333 --> 17:16.834
He's got muscle, too..

17:16.917 --> 17:18.125
...only they wear badges.

17:18.208 --> 17:20.291
Now I know you're
still using,
Victor.

17:20.375 --> 17:22.083
Saying a cop did
Dex Collins, huh?

17:22.166 --> 17:23.750
Saying if Boone
wanted Dex done

17:23.834 --> 17:25.166
he'd be done.

17:25.250 --> 17:27.417
- You fill in the blanks.
- Yeah, we'll do that.

17:27.500 --> 17:30.333
You remember how the rest
of this goes.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.000
Came up in the department
with Pat Doherty.

17:32.083 --> 17:34.041
He's never served a day
of street duty.

17:34.125 --> 17:36.250
- Desk jockey, huh?
- Political operator.

17:36.333 --> 17:38.834
Goes lieutenant to deputy
commissioner in two years.

17:38.917 --> 17:41.208
- Hitched his wagon to Boone.
- Not just him.

17:41.291 --> 17:43.709
Health Department closes
Warren's restaurant in '05.

17:43.792 --> 17:45.959
He files a complaint
that gets thrown out.

17:46.041 --> 17:48.458
Electricity's shut down
in his house the next day.

17:48.542 --> 17:50.250
Yeah, Boone takes
no prisoners.

17:50.333 --> 17:52.792
He's not all bad. Hires cops
to
moonlight for him.

17:52.875 --> 17:54.208
Speaks up for
us
at city hall.

17:54.291 --> 17:56.458
And then condemns us
on the 5 o'clock news

17:56.542 --> 17:57.458
when it hits the fan.

17:57.542 --> 17:58.959
'This election
got ugly.'

17:59.041 --> 18:00.458
Dex's campaign office
was broken into

18:00.542 --> 18:02.291
volunteers harassed.

18:02.375 --> 18:03.834
Maybe someone went too far.

18:03.917 --> 18:06.166
Making extra points for
taking out the competition.

18:06.250 --> 18:08.375
Meeting with Warren,
see if he remembers

18:08.458 --> 18:10.166
any rabid Boone supporters.

18:10.250 --> 18:12.208
Gonna contact Boone, too.

18:12.291 --> 18:14.375
That's a
hornet's
nest, Scotty.

18:14.458 --> 18:16.041
I'll handle Boone.

18:18.041 --> 18:19.250
You sold the guns
on the street

18:19.333 --> 18:20.667
filed a false report.

18:20.750 --> 18:21.834
Not the first
time, either.

18:21.917 --> 18:23.333
You got a whole
side business going.

18:23.417 --> 18:24.500
'Ain't that right?'

18:24.583 --> 18:25.709
I don't recall.

18:30.583 --> 18:31.750
Listen, Ray.

18:31.834 --> 18:33.125
It's Jay.

18:33.917 --> 18:35.959
Right, Jay.

18:36.041 --> 18:37.875
I pulled the other reports
you filed.

18:37.959 --> 18:39.458
I got 'em right here.

18:39.542 --> 18:41.542
Uh...somewhere.

18:41.625 --> 18:43.291
Hang on a second.
I know that..

18:43.375 --> 18:44.500
Was it yesterday..

18:44.583 --> 18:46.875
Seven handguns
in Delaware in 2002.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.041
'12 in Jersey
the next year.'

18:49.125 --> 18:50.500
I got bad luck.

18:50.583 --> 18:52.000
Don't know the half of it.

18:52.083 --> 18:54.625
One of your guns was used
in the shooting of a
policeman.

18:54.709 --> 18:57.125
'Another wounded a
little girl on a
playground.'

18:57.208 --> 18:59.709
Now, I'm a cop and a mom, Jay.

18:59.792 --> 19:02.041
You've pissed me off
twice already.

19:02.125 --> 19:03.583
Then, there's Dex Collins.

19:03.667 --> 19:05.250
'Sold the gun
to the killer.'

19:05.333 --> 19:06.625
That's conspiracy.

19:08.542 --> 19:10.709
- Prove it.
- That's why the DA's here,
Jay.

19:10.792 --> 19:13.291
To be honest, I'm not
that
good a lawyer.

19:13.375 --> 19:15.750
ADD, you know?
Makes it hard.

19:15.834 --> 19:17.333
That's why I work this crap job.

19:17.417 --> 19:20.041
Oh, here we
go,
okay, so..

19:20.125 --> 19:22.542
The report says that the guns

19:22.625 --> 19:24.333
were stolen
from your mother's house

19:24.417 --> 19:27.417
so even when we prove
this false and we will

19:27.500 --> 19:29.417
any half-assed public
defender's gonna say

19:29.500 --> 19:30.583
that we can't
connect it to
you

19:30.667 --> 19:32.083
'so what I'm
proposing is--'

19:32.166 --> 19:34.542
So I can go.

19:34.625 --> 19:35.792
Yeah..

19:35.875 --> 19:38.083
...but Mom's
gonna
have to stay.

19:38.166 --> 19:39.917
Like you're gonna arrest
an old lady.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.750
You see, Ray, not
only
are we arresting her

19:42.834 --> 19:44.125
but, uh..

19:45.667 --> 19:47.375
...we're gonna
convict her,
too.

19:47.458 --> 19:51.333
Hey, Mrs. Quincy. Your
old
lady's gonna spend

19:51.417 --> 19:54.917
the rest of her life
in a cage thinking one thing

19:55.000 --> 19:56.458
my son did this to me.

20:02.250 --> 20:04.250
It was a Dominican guy.

20:04.333 --> 20:06.041
Hangs out at the hardware depot.

20:07.333 --> 20:08.792
Jorge Gonzalez.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.166
'Okay?'

20:10.250 --> 20:11.291
Anything else?

20:11.375 --> 20:13.333
Yeah, you gonna drink that?

20:29.000 --> 20:30.333
You should have
called first, John.

20:30.417 --> 20:33.208
Yeah, would he
have called back?

20:33.291 --> 20:35.417
This is about
Dex Collins?

20:35.500 --> 20:36.959
I'm looking for
a list of supporters

20:37.041 --> 20:38.375
from the last campaign.

20:38.458 --> 20:39.375
Never gonna happen.

20:39.458 --> 20:41.000
You impeding
an investigation?

20:41.083 --> 20:43.125
I'm looking out
for you, John.

20:43.208 --> 20:47.458
Look, Boone is just gonna
refer you to his attorney.

20:47.542 --> 20:48.834
Then, he's gonna
call
the commissioner

20:48.917 --> 20:50.792
and have you
transferred
to the motor pool.

20:50.875 --> 20:54.000
We did a thorough job
on
this case three years
ago.

20:54.083 --> 20:56.041
Dex Collins was
killed
buying dope.

20:56.125 --> 20:57.500
Except you didn't find the doer.

20:57.583 --> 20:58.834
He was probably
dead too

20:58.917 --> 21:00.333
community service murder.

21:01.875 --> 21:03.875
You don't wanna
start a riot in the
streets

21:03.959 --> 21:05.000
by stirring this up.

21:05.083 --> 21:06.291
You worried about
a riot in the streets?

21:06.375 --> 21:08.959
- Or a riot in city hall?
- Both.

21:09.041 --> 21:11.458
So, Boone is refusing
to cooperate?

21:11.542 --> 21:13.000
Did I say that?

21:13.083 --> 21:15.166
Come on, John,
relax,
we're working

21:15.250 --> 21:16.917
the same job here.

21:17.625 --> 21:18.834
I do police work, Pat.

21:18.917 --> 21:20.792
Not exactly sure what you do.

21:22.792 --> 21:23.792
Councilman Boone.

21:23.875 --> 21:25.041
Good to see
you,
Lieutenant.

21:25.125 --> 21:26.792
'Sorry I can't talk.'

21:27.667 --> 21:29.750
Do it again real soon.

21:36.959 --> 21:39.542
(Lilly)
'You paid a big price
supporting Dexter Collins'

21:39.625 --> 21:40.875
during the election

21:40.959 --> 21:43.166
going against
the Boone machine.

21:43.250 --> 21:45.375
Yeah, it was
tough for a
while.

21:45.458 --> 21:47.375
No income,
three
daughters.

21:47.458 --> 21:49.709
Worked 12 hours
a day for Dex

21:49.792 --> 21:52.625
then bartended at a
club
after hours just to get
by.

21:52.709 --> 21:54.959
But back in
business
now, though.

21:55.041 --> 21:56.792
Boone cooled off
after Dex died.

21:56.875 --> 21:58.041
Think it was one
of Boone's people?

21:58.125 --> 22:00.834
Got overenthusiastic,
went after Dex?

22:00.917 --> 22:03.125
Well, everybody
was kind of
crazy.

22:03.208 --> 22:07.125
You know, bricks were
thrown, tires slashed

22:07.208 --> 22:09.542
but the worst damage
we did to ourselves.

22:09.625 --> 22:12.542
- What does that mean?
- We were doing well in
polls.

22:12.625 --> 22:14.583
But, uh, flat broke.

22:14.667 --> 22:17.125
The big donors were
afraid
of alienating Boone

22:17.208 --> 22:19.417
so we got into bed
with the wrong
people.

22:19.500 --> 22:21.041
You're saying
it was one of Dex's own

22:21.125 --> 22:23.291
supporters
who took him out?

22:23.375 --> 22:27.250
I'm saying,
you lie down with
dogs..

22:31.875 --> 22:35.083
He's here. Mulwrey is here.
He's, five steps behind me.

22:35.166 --> 22:36.417
I thought
you were pitching him.

22:36.500 --> 22:38.000
But he said that
he wanted to meet
you.

22:38.083 --> 22:40.709
Dex, this guy is big
money,
and he is no bull, okay?

22:40.792 --> 22:41.959
We are one minute away

22:42.041 --> 22:43.291
from having our
phones repossessed

22:43.375 --> 22:44.917
so, please don't
piss him off,
okay?

22:45.000 --> 22:48.166
Don't preach to him.
Just be normal, okay?

22:48.250 --> 22:49.375
We need this.

22:49.458 --> 22:50.834
Mr. Mulwrey, um..

22:52.333 --> 22:54.542
Why don't you, uh,
come into my office?

23:07.875 --> 23:09.417
- Mr. Mulwrey?
- I've heard enough.

23:09.500 --> 23:12.000
You're my guy. Just maybe
consider some real shoes.

23:20.917 --> 23:22.709
Oh, my God!

23:27.333 --> 23:30.250
There was 50 grand
easy in that case.

23:30.333 --> 23:33.375
Street money.
What did Mulwrey want in
return?

23:33.458 --> 23:34.709
He was lobbying city hall

23:34.792 --> 23:36.625
to redevelop
the Chandler Housing
Projects.

23:36.709 --> 23:39.333
Would have displaced
hundreds of poor
residents.

23:39.417 --> 23:41.333
Dex spoke out against that
during the campaign.

23:41.417 --> 23:44.583
Mulwrey figured
he'd buy Dex's
silence.

23:44.667 --> 23:47.333
But the next day, Dex
held a press
conference

23:47.417 --> 23:49.417
denouncing
the Chandler
redevelopment.

23:49.500 --> 23:52.625
So Dex takes the man's money
and screws him a day later.

23:52.709 --> 23:56.000
Mulwrey comes out
of the construction business.

23:56.083 --> 23:57.041
Waste management.

23:57.125 --> 23:58.333
Plays by
different
rules.

23:58.417 --> 24:00.458
You hit him, he hits back.

24:00.542 --> 24:02.375
With a vengeance.

24:05.709 --> 24:07.291
(male #2)
'Closing it up now.'

24:08.792 --> 24:11.375
This used to be the Chandler
Housing Project, right?

24:13.417 --> 24:16.000
Pulled that eyesore down
three years ago.

24:16.083 --> 24:17.125
Feels good to give back.

24:17.208 --> 24:18.750
I'm sure you
relocated all the
people

24:18.834 --> 24:20.542
who got displaced, too.

24:20.625 --> 24:22.333
The city contracted me
to redevelop here.

24:22.417 --> 24:23.875
Yeah, 'cause
you paid 'em off.

24:23.959 --> 24:27.208
But not everyone toed the
line.
Dex Collins, for example.

24:27.291 --> 24:29.041
(Nick)
'Gave him a lot
of money to back off.'

24:29.125 --> 24:32.041
Only he screwed you to the
wall
with a press conference.

24:32.125 --> 24:33.834
Almost ended this cash cow.

24:33.917 --> 24:35.458
It's called the cost
of doing business.

24:35.542 --> 24:38.500
As you can see,
I ended up on top.

24:38.583 --> 24:40.291
And Dex ended up dead.

24:41.625 --> 24:43.500
Dex and I were straight.

24:43.583 --> 24:45.458
First time in the history
of Philly politics

24:45.542 --> 24:47.834
that a candidate actually
gave money back.

24:47.917 --> 24:49.208
Dex returned
the 50 grand?

24:49.291 --> 24:51.625
Guy was sincere,
I'll give him that.

24:51.709 --> 24:53.291
But a bit too naive
for his own good.

24:53.375 --> 24:55.500
Because he was on
the up-and-up?

24:55.583 --> 24:57.542
Because he didn't know
that his campaign manager

24:57.625 --> 24:59.041
was taking cash from everyone

24:59.125 --> 25:01.250
and putting it on the street.

25:01.333 --> 25:02.458
Cassie Michaels told us

25:02.542 --> 25:04.083
they never took a penny
of street money.

25:04.166 --> 25:06.041
Well, then she lied.

25:06.125 --> 25:08.500
I don't care
how charismatic you are.

25:08.583 --> 25:09.959
In ward politics

25:10.041 --> 25:12.625
the bosses don't lift a
finger
without getting paid.

25:12.709 --> 25:14.417
Cassie went behind his back?

25:14.500 --> 25:17.583
The guy ran his whole campaign
on doing things different.

25:17.667 --> 25:19.750
He just didn't know
what the other hand was doing.

25:19.834 --> 25:21.166
So, he gave you
your money back?

25:21.250 --> 25:22.959
'Figured he found out
what she was up to.'

25:23.041 --> 25:24.917
Isn't that why
he fired her?

25:30.792 --> 25:31.917
What's up with
this new DA?

25:32.000 --> 25:33.250
Waiting half
an hour to
start

25:33.333 --> 25:35.041
lineup for our
straw purchaser
Quincy.

25:35.125 --> 25:37.333
Bell's nowhere.
Who is this jackass
anyway?

25:37.417 --> 25:39.583
Bell's good people.
His dad was a cop.

25:39.667 --> 25:40.959
Killed in the line.

25:46.750 --> 25:48.041
Car broke down.

25:48.667 --> 25:49.917
Hey.

25:56.709 --> 25:58.583
Recognize any
of them, Jay?

25:58.667 --> 26:00.959
Hard to say.
They all look alike.

26:01.041 --> 26:02.458
(Bell)
'Let's pretend
for a minute that'

26:02.542 --> 26:03.875
your mom's life
depended on it

26:03.959 --> 26:06.291
because it
kinda does.

26:11.834 --> 26:13.250
(Jay)
'Number four.'

26:13.333 --> 26:15.583
Wasn't hard to
say,
after all.

26:21.542 --> 26:23.750
You held back
about the street money.

26:23.834 --> 26:26.417
Dex wasn't taking it,
but you were.

26:26.500 --> 26:28.333
Well, I was doing my job.

26:28.417 --> 26:29.959
That how Dex saw it?

26:30.041 --> 26:31.834
- 'Goin' behind his back.'
- Yeah, he understood.

26:31.917 --> 26:32.959
That why he let you go?

26:33.041 --> 26:35.375
I was good at my job..

26:35.458 --> 26:36.500
...and he knew that.

26:36.583 --> 26:37.917
'Well, it was more
than that.'

26:38.000 --> 26:40.667
I did some background
on you two.

26:40.750 --> 26:42.125
You met at Yale.

26:42.208 --> 26:44.083
- Shared an apartment.
- Yeah, we were friends.

26:44.166 --> 26:45.667
With benefits, right?

26:45.750 --> 26:47.166
'But the relationship changed.'

26:47.250 --> 26:48.583
We went in different directions.

26:48.667 --> 26:51.417
Yet you drop
everything when he calls.

26:53.709 --> 26:56.500
Okay, what do
you want me to say?

26:56.583 --> 26:58.542
You want me to say that I
still
had a thing for Dex?

26:58.625 --> 27:00.166
So what if I did?

27:00.250 --> 27:01.875
It had to be tough.

27:01.959 --> 27:06.291
Him wanting you in his camp,
just not on his arm.

27:06.375 --> 27:09.750
<i>his</i>
neighborhood at least.

27:13.250 --> 27:15.000
You know, in my
experience

27:15.083 --> 27:17.709
top motives for murder

27:17.792 --> 27:19.667
love and money.

27:19.750 --> 27:23.000
- I didn't kill Dex.
- 'Which was worse, Cassie?'

27:23.083 --> 27:24.458
Getting fired or dumped?

27:24.542 --> 27:26.500
I was protecting him
from himself.

27:26.583 --> 27:27.750
'Dex was a saint.'

27:27.834 --> 27:29.709
But he never understood.

27:29.792 --> 27:32.542
Saints don't win elections.

27:32.625 --> 27:35.041
We are about to take down
the most powerful member

27:35.125 --> 27:36.625
of the city council,
that wouldn't happen

27:36.709 --> 27:37.834
without street money.

27:37.917 --> 27:39.208
You don't get it, Cass.

27:39.291 --> 27:41.041
It doesn't count if
we
play by their
rules.

27:41.125 --> 27:42.667
Says who?
Where is it written

27:42.750 --> 27:45.000
that Dex Collins
can't work the system?

27:45.083 --> 27:46.500
The system's broken.

27:46.583 --> 27:48.375
I am trying to show people
we don't need it anymore.

27:48.458 --> 27:51.583
Your ideals are nothing
if you lose. They're nothing.

27:51.667 --> 27:52.959
'That is why I'm here.'

27:53.041 --> 27:55.250
Because I keep you grounded.

27:55.333 --> 27:57.417
I put you in the game.

27:57.500 --> 27:59.291
I didn't ask you to.

27:59.375 --> 28:01.041
'You think
you've done this alone?'

28:01.125 --> 28:02.417
If it wasn't for me,
you would still be

28:02.500 --> 28:05.125
the most popular activist
on Sixth Street.

28:07.834 --> 28:10.166
Instead, you..

28:10.250 --> 28:12.208
...are a political presence.

28:13.583 --> 28:16.333
Just imagine
what we can do.

28:22.792 --> 28:25.333
You can't be a
part
of this anymore.

28:27.792 --> 28:29.458
There's a reporter on the
phone
<i>Inquirer.</i>

28:29.542 --> 28:32.542
Wants a comment from Dex
about a story for tomorrow.

28:32.625 --> 28:36.333
Has to do with June 13, 1987.

28:36.417 --> 28:38.709
I'm sorry, is that
supposed to mean something?

28:44.667 --> 28:46.000
(Scotty)
'What did the reporter have?'

28:46.083 --> 28:47.417
He never said.

28:48.375 --> 28:50.625
Dex kept things from me, too.

28:51.583 --> 28:52.709
And a day later, he was dead.

28:52.792 --> 28:54.083
'Yeah, that's not
good enough.'

28:54.166 --> 28:55.917
Cassie, you were
his campaign manager.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.875
His friend. You saying
you never found out?

28:58.959 --> 29:00.667
Yeah.

29:01.709 --> 29:04.333
Unfortunately, I did.

29:14.917 --> 29:18.458
I've been meaning to tell you
how much I admired your son.

29:19.583 --> 29:21.917
Of course
no one's perfect.

29:22.875 --> 29:24.041
'Cause in 1987

29:24.125 --> 29:26.417
Dex was arrested
for dealing drugs.

29:29.792 --> 29:31.625
Just like the rest,
looking to bring my son down.

29:31.709 --> 29:35.792
I'm looking for the
truth.
Why didn't you tell
me?

29:35.875 --> 29:37.333
It would have given you
an excuse to walk away.

29:37.417 --> 29:40.500
You owe Dex more than just
sitting vigil for him.

29:42.959 --> 29:44.625
Tell me what happened.

29:48.750 --> 29:51.875
Cops come to my house
one morning.

29:51.959 --> 29:53.125
Say they busted Dex

29:53.208 --> 29:56.500
for slinging dope
the night before.

29:58.041 --> 30:00.250
I said, no, sir, not my son.

30:00.333 --> 30:02.458
You must have got it wrong.

30:02.542 --> 30:04.333
But they were right.

30:07.125 --> 30:08.583
13-years-old..

30:10.125 --> 30:12.041
...and they got him in lockup.

30:13.583 --> 30:17.458
Judge suspended the charges
because of my boy's academics.

30:19.709 --> 30:24.667
Yeah, I did everything I
could
to keep him off the street.

30:24.750 --> 30:27.500
Street still killed him
in the end.

30:29.208 --> 30:30.583
'Juvenile record's sealed'

30:30.667 --> 30:32.208
but a reporter
found out
anyway.

30:32.291 --> 30:35.208
Any idea who else
could have told him, Ronnie?

30:36.375 --> 30:38.125
Oh, yeah.

30:39.458 --> 30:40.709
(Lilly)
'Dex's juvenile record.'

30:40.792 --> 30:41.959
'Picked up for distribution'

30:42.041 --> 30:44.750
of cocaine, June '87.

30:44.834 --> 30:47.250
Were you with him.
Dex got off.

30:47.333 --> 30:48.875
His father made a deal.

30:48.959 --> 30:51.166
Sent him away
to a fancy school.

30:51.250 --> 30:52.375
'But not you, Victor.'

30:52.458 --> 30:54.000
Nah, I took the full hit.

30:54.083 --> 30:57.625
Now, 24 months at Glen Mills
Youth Detention Center.

30:57.709 --> 31:00.417
These records are sealed.
Public has no access to them.

31:00.500 --> 31:03.625
So tell me how the "Inquirer"
found out about it.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.083
You charging me?

31:06.166 --> 31:08.000
Only other person
who'd remember.

31:08.083 --> 31:11.125
Only one who can
confirm it, you.

31:11.208 --> 31:13.375
Charge me,
if you're gonna charge me.

31:13.458 --> 31:14.750
Call Boone,
tell him the job's
done.

31:14.834 --> 31:16.333
Oh, you think
I answer to Boone?

31:16.417 --> 31:18.500
You police, ain't you?

31:24.000 --> 31:26.291
I answer to him.

31:27.917 --> 31:29.291
You were pissed
at Dex for dodging

31:29.375 --> 31:30.333
the bullet
all those years ago.

31:30.417 --> 31:31.667
Making something of himself.

31:31.750 --> 31:34.291
- He gave me a second chance.
- 'Right.'

31:34.375 --> 31:36.208
As his errand boy.

31:36.291 --> 31:38.291
What else was I good for?

31:38.375 --> 31:39.875
Exactly. You were
nothing but a thug.

31:39.959 --> 31:41.500
You thought you'd take him
down a notch.

31:41.583 --> 31:44.125
Remind everyone exactly
what street Dex comes from.

31:44.208 --> 31:45.583
But what I can't
figure out, Victor

31:45.667 --> 31:47.542
why you had to shoot him, too.

31:49.542 --> 31:51.625
I was so high that
night
I barely remember

31:51.709 --> 31:53.583
what was happening.

31:53.667 --> 31:55.709
Go the hell away!

31:55.792 --> 31:57.417
Look, I told you. I..

31:58.667 --> 32:00.667
'Damn, I thought you was
a reporter.'

32:00.750 --> 32:02.375
Where have you been?

32:02.458 --> 32:05.417
I'm in here,
not feeling too good.

32:11.834 --> 32:13.291
Any more?

32:13.375 --> 32:15.834
Look, I ain't ever had nobody
looking out for me.

32:15.917 --> 32:17.333
Hey, drop
that self-pity routine.

32:17.417 --> 32:18.792
The reporter just came.

32:18.875 --> 32:20.250
They wanted me to know
about what happened between us

32:20.333 --> 32:21.625
back in the day, you know?

32:21.709 --> 32:24.333
I didn't say anything
but they gave me money anyway.

32:24.417 --> 32:27.333
Doesn't matter, Victor.

32:27.417 --> 32:29.500
I said nothing. I don't
even
know how they found out.

32:29.583 --> 32:31.917
It was Boone.

32:32.000 --> 32:35.959
Someone slipped these
under my door this morning.

32:36.041 --> 32:37.875
'Thought it was you.'

32:40.417 --> 32:43.625
Boone keeps pushing and pushing.

32:43.709 --> 32:45.583
I'm sick of it.

32:47.625 --> 32:49.834
- This ends tonight.
- What are you gonna do?

32:49.917 --> 32:51.583
Talk to Boone.

32:51.667 --> 32:55.417
He's got dirt on me,
and I've got dirt on him.

33:02.458 --> 33:04.208
The photo showed Boone
with a woman?

33:04.291 --> 33:06.083
Stripper from
the Oasis
Club.

33:06.166 --> 33:09.041
He was doing her for months
while his wife was sick

33:09.125 --> 33:10.375
and dying in the hospital.

33:10.458 --> 33:11.917
A man of the people, my ass.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.834
When exactly did Dex go
to see Boone?

33:14.917 --> 33:17.583
A few hours
before he
died.

33:17.667 --> 33:19.125
And you never told?

33:19.208 --> 33:20.792
A guy like Dex.

33:20.875 --> 33:23.291
High-profile, respected.

33:24.417 --> 33:26.834
Gunned down like a dog.

33:28.166 --> 33:31.333
What do you think
they'll do to a guy like me?

33:42.083 --> 33:44.250
Patrick.

33:44.333 --> 33:46.583
They're towing my damn car.

33:46.667 --> 33:48.083
Jeez.

33:50.375 --> 33:51.709
Hey!

33:58.166 --> 34:02.458
Where did you find a parking
employee with the balls

34:02.542 --> 34:04.125
to tow my car?

34:04.208 --> 34:06.625
You've got your people,
I've got mine.

34:06.709 --> 34:08.250
Let's talk about Dex Collins.

34:08.333 --> 34:09.375
Why would I do that?

34:09.458 --> 34:10.959
Because Doherty's
wife works

34:11.041 --> 34:12.959
admin at a juvenile court.

34:13.041 --> 34:15.125
You had her look
into Dex's sealed
record

34:15.208 --> 34:16.709
'leak it to "The Inquirer."'

34:16.792 --> 34:18.041
You can do better than that.

34:18.125 --> 34:19.542
I also have a witness

34:19.625 --> 34:22.542
placing you with Dex
the night he was
murdered.

34:22.625 --> 34:23.792
Maybe I should
call my lawyers.

34:23.875 --> 34:26.291
Well, then we're
talking
headlines, Grover.

34:26.375 --> 34:28.625
Being a suspect in
a murder
investigation

34:28.709 --> 34:30.959
doesn't really help when
you're
making a run at mayor.

34:31.041 --> 34:34.083
You know, I never knew you
to be political, John.

34:34.166 --> 34:36.208
If you'd played ball
a few years ago

34:36.291 --> 34:37.709
you'd be head
of the department now.

34:37.792 --> 34:39.583
This isn't politics.

34:40.417 --> 34:42.625
Everything's politics.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.625
But since I like you

34:46.709 --> 34:48.291
I'm gonna give you
ten minutes.

34:48.375 --> 34:50.083
Ask your questions.

34:50.166 --> 34:52.542
Dex came to you
the night he
died.

34:52.625 --> 34:53.667
He had some photographs.

34:53.750 --> 34:55.166
'I was expecting
a showdown.'

34:55.250 --> 34:57.750
But the boy had a way
of surprising you.

34:59.667 --> 35:01.500
You had a..

35:01.583 --> 35:03.667
'...tough day
in the press.'

35:03.750 --> 35:06.250
'It's only gonna
get tougher.'

35:06.333 --> 35:10.500
Unless, if you've come
to surrender.

35:15.291 --> 35:18.291
You should probably
avoid the Oasis Club.

35:19.917 --> 35:22.917
At least while your wife's
in the hospital.

35:26.375 --> 35:29.875
Hmm, that's like telling
a dog not to bark.

35:31.667 --> 35:33.834
Everyone has something.

35:35.083 --> 35:36.625
Even you.

35:38.625 --> 35:41.458
Let me tell my wife first.

35:41.542 --> 35:43.875
I don't want her
to see this in the news.

35:43.959 --> 35:46.375
I'm giving these back to you.

35:46.458 --> 35:49.834
We're wasting time
beating each other to a pulp.

35:50.792 --> 35:52.083
And what do you propose?

35:52.166 --> 35:53.542
'You kill the newspaper story'

35:53.625 --> 35:55.917
I kill the photos,
no more smear jobs.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.458
How do I know
there aren't more copies?

35:57.542 --> 36:01.000
You don't. So let's be
the good guys, Grover.

36:02.125 --> 36:04.959
I absolutely underestimated you.

36:06.542 --> 36:09.875
You know, if the roles
were reversed

36:11.333 --> 36:13.583
I wouldn't pay you the courtesy.

36:13.667 --> 36:14.792
I know.

36:14.875 --> 36:17.458
So why are you doing it?

36:17.542 --> 36:20.208
'Cause I'm gonna
beat you anyway.

36:22.667 --> 36:26.125
All my years in politics,
I never met anyone like him.

36:26.208 --> 36:28.417
Kinda wish
he was still around.

36:28.500 --> 36:30.250
It would've
made life interesting.

36:30.333 --> 36:32.333
You couldn't last 30
years
on the city council

36:32.417 --> 36:34.083
without knowing your enemies.

36:34.166 --> 36:35.917
You ever find out
who took the
photos?

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
No one in my campaign.

36:38.083 --> 36:40.667
I'm curious, Grover,
if Dex had lived

36:41.959 --> 36:44.208
would you have killed
the news story?

36:52.083 --> 36:54.834
Looks like your
ten minutes are up.

36:57.709 --> 37:00.000
We'll do it again real soon.

37:05.834 --> 37:07.375
Something kicked up
on your suspect

37:07.458 --> 37:09.250
from the lineup,
Jorge Gomez.

37:09.333 --> 37:11.583
Turns out this isn't
his first arrest.

37:11.667 --> 37:13.083
I ran his
name,
no felonies.

37:13.166 --> 37:14.375
But he's got
a misdemeanor.

37:14.458 --> 37:16.000
Drunk and
disorderly in '04.

37:16.083 --> 37:17.792
Held overnight on $500 bail.

37:17.875 --> 37:19.625
His boss at the time
bailed him out.

37:19.709 --> 37:21.166
His boss?

37:21.250 --> 37:23.542
Owner of the Diamond Diner.

37:27.291 --> 37:30.291
You're no career criminal,
Warren.

37:30.375 --> 37:31.750
(Lilly)
'If you were,
you wouldn't ask'

37:31.834 --> 37:33.458
three other employees
where to buy a gun

37:33.542 --> 37:34.959
before Jorge Gomez.

37:35.041 --> 37:37.250
Or you'd have thought
to toss it in the
Schuylkill.

37:37.333 --> 37:39.834
Not in a drain pipe
half a block from Dex's
body.

37:39.917 --> 37:41.417
(Lilly)
'Checked your story
for that night.'

37:41.500 --> 37:43.125
Bartending at the Oasis.

37:43.208 --> 37:45.125
But the manager says
you clocked you out early.

37:45.208 --> 37:48.500
Alibi's shot, got you with the
gun, it's premeditated murder.

37:48.583 --> 37:50.709
You're looking at life.

37:52.417 --> 37:54.000
That gun was for protection.

37:54.083 --> 37:55.834
That's not how you used it.

37:55.917 --> 37:57.709
(Lilly)
'The thing
about the Oasis Club?'

37:57.792 --> 38:00.041
That's where those blackmail
photos of Boone were taken.

38:00.125 --> 38:02.583
See, what I don't get,
why put your neck out

38:02.667 --> 38:04.959
for Dex taking those photos,
then get a gun to kill him?

38:05.041 --> 38:06.792
That's not how it happened.

38:06.875 --> 38:09.834
(Lilly)
'You're gonna have to explain
it to us then, Warren.'

38:09.917 --> 38:11.709
So we can help you.

38:13.166 --> 38:16.041
Give us something for the DA.

38:16.125 --> 38:17.333
Do 20 years instead.

38:17.417 --> 38:19.834
Get some time with your
family at the other end.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.750
I got a right
to support a candidate

38:22.834 --> 38:24.625
without being harassed.

38:24.709 --> 38:26.500
Sure,
as long as it's Boone.

38:26.583 --> 38:28.834
(Scotty)
'Yeah, but Boone put
the screws to you.'

38:28.917 --> 38:31.166
He used
everything
in his arsenal

38:31.250 --> 38:34.083
the health
department,
even the cops.

38:34.166 --> 38:36.959
He was out for blood.

38:37.041 --> 38:38.834
He had people watching me.

38:38.917 --> 38:41.583
- It's why I got the gun.
- 'Sure.'

38:43.875 --> 38:45.709
Position you were in

38:45.792 --> 38:47.250
I'd have done the same.

38:47.333 --> 38:49.542
I mean, all that rage

38:49.625 --> 38:51.792
but why take it
out on the wrong
guy?

38:51.875 --> 38:54.375
This epic dogfight
between him and Boone

38:54.458 --> 38:56.291
and you're caught
in the middle.

38:56.375 --> 38:57.500
'Over your head.'

38:57.583 --> 38:59.750
I mean, I couldn't
think straight.

38:59.834 --> 39:01.625
I couldn't sleep anymore.

39:02.542 --> 39:04.500
And Dex wouldn't..

39:05.834 --> 39:07.083
(Scotty)
'What? What happened?'

39:07.166 --> 39:09.000
What made you turn?

39:13.709 --> 39:17.250
All that talk about
looking in the mirror

39:17.333 --> 39:19.917
seeing faith,
that was powerful stuff.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.792
That's what hooked you
onto Dex, right?

39:22.875 --> 39:24.083
So let me ask you

39:24.166 --> 39:26.166
when you look
in the mirror now..

39:26.250 --> 39:27.875
Go on.

39:30.875 --> 39:32.709
What do you see?

39:37.041 --> 39:38.959
I see Dex.

39:48.792 --> 39:50.625
- Whoo!
- 'Dex.'

39:50.709 --> 39:52.417
There you are.

39:53.458 --> 39:54.625
'Where have you been?'

39:54.709 --> 39:56.166
Look at this.

39:56.250 --> 39:58.250
No dealers.
No buyers.

39:58.333 --> 40:00.166
Boone had the cops
sweep the block.

40:00.250 --> 40:01.667
'Today, Sixth Street.'

40:01.750 --> 40:04.291
Tomorrow, Seventh, the Eighth

40:04.375 --> 40:07.959
- The whole district--
- What happened with Boone?

40:08.041 --> 40:12.083
I wish I could've seen his
face
when he got those photos.

40:12.166 --> 40:14.125
It was you?

40:14.208 --> 40:16.917
You're messing with
the wrong guy,
Warren.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.917
That's why I got this.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.291
Anyway, who cares?

40:20.375 --> 40:22.208
We are gonna win now!

40:27.750 --> 40:29.208
Dex..

40:31.500 --> 40:33.667
You didn't use the photos?

40:33.750 --> 40:35.750
'We don't have
a chance without 'em.'

40:35.834 --> 40:38.375
Look, we're in a
dead
heat right now.

40:38.458 --> 40:41.125
But if we don't pull it out
this
time, we'll get him next
time.

40:41.208 --> 40:43.917
Next time
is four years from now.

40:44.750 --> 40:46.834
I don't have four weeks!

40:47.959 --> 40:50.583
Boone's taken my restaurant.

40:51.583 --> 40:52.917
I can't pay my bills.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.500
Now what's he gonna do
to me when you lose?

40:54.583 --> 40:57.667
Warren, I guarantee
you,
he stays away.

41:06.208 --> 41:08.333
You cut a deal.

41:09.125 --> 41:10.542
'What'd Boone offer?'

41:10.625 --> 41:12.333
Clean up your street?

41:12.417 --> 41:13.667
Run you in another district?

41:14.917 --> 41:16.166
Or was it a straight-up payoff?

41:16.250 --> 41:18.417
No, it's not like that.

41:18.500 --> 41:19.709
'I should've known.'

41:19.792 --> 41:22.041
You're just like the rest.
All crooks!

41:22.125 --> 41:23.625
- Sellouts!
- Warren, for God's sake--

41:23.709 --> 41:25.375
And I'm the one who gets
screwed!

41:25.458 --> 41:26.917
Listen, man!

43:57.625 --> 43:58.875
