01:18.378 --> 01:19.970
Princess Kasumi.

01:21.618 --> 01:25.293
Your brother is dead.
Your destiny is to lead your people.

01:30.378 --> 01:33.654
I will not believe he is dead
until I see his body.

01:35.698 --> 01:37.290
There is no body.

01:38.418 --> 01:40.215
Then he is not dead.

01:42.058 --> 01:45.494
- I am going to find him.
- The guards won't let you leave.

01:45.578 --> 01:50.493
I am not a cricket in a box.
I alone determine my destiny.

01:50.578 --> 01:54.093
But, Princess, as your brother's best friend
you must let me help you.

01:54.178 --> 01:58.330
If my brother is really dead
then you are no longer his best friend.

02:00.778 --> 02:04.691
Princess Kasumi, if you leave
you suffer the same fate as your brother.

02:04.778 --> 02:06.734
You'll become an outcast,

02:07.658 --> 02:09.295
a <i>shinobi</i>.

02:10.418 --> 02:11.692
So be it.

02:14.378 --> 02:16.846
Princess, the guards will kill you.

03:15.338 --> 03:18.808
Ayane, I know of your love for my brother.

03:20.058 --> 03:22.697
I will find Hayate and bring him home.

03:25.498 --> 03:27.056
Princess Kasumi,

03:28.698 --> 03:31.087
I beg you, do not leave the clan.

03:36.258 --> 03:41.252
I am your servant. But if you leave,
I'm honor-bound to kill you.

04:44.898 --> 04:48.095
Miss Armstrong, I'm sorry to interrupt,
but it's your father again.

04:48.378 --> 04:49.936
I told you I'm busy.

04:50.018 --> 04:51.337
But, Miss Armstrong, he just...

04:51.418 --> 04:54.012
- Okay, put him on speaker.
- Very good.

04:55.498 --> 04:56.772
Hi, Dad, what's up?

04:56.858 --> 04:59.326
<i>Sweetheart, I just hope you know</i>
<i>what you're giving up.</i>

04:59.418 --> 05:00.931
Dad, we already talked about this.

05:01.018 --> 05:03.486
<i>But if you get the afternoon flight,</i>
<i>you can still make it</i>

05:03.578 --> 05:05.694
<i>to the Tag Team Championship</i>
<i>in Des Moines.</i>

05:05.778 --> 05:10.374
Dad, I already told you, I am done wrestling.
I'm done being fake. I'm done.

05:11.018 --> 05:12.371
<i>Sweetheart?</i>

05:14.138 --> 05:15.651
<i>Are you there?</i>

05:15.738 --> 05:18.775
Hey, Dad. I'm gonna have to call you back
in a minute, okay?

05:34.618 --> 05:35.846
Miss Armstrong.

05:37.098 --> 05:38.611
Miss Armstrong!

05:47.698 --> 05:50.496
Here's the deal, lady. We want the yacht.

05:50.778 --> 05:53.576
If you do exactly as we say, you'll live.

05:54.578 --> 05:57.536
If you don't,
then you'll pay with excruciating...

05:57.618 --> 05:59.176
No deal, boys.

06:01.258 --> 06:06.776
You boys get off my yacht now,
and y'all will avoid excruciating pain.

06:50.578 --> 06:52.330
You need some help, buddy?

06:52.418 --> 06:56.047
It's okay. Come on. Come on. It's okay.

06:56.218 --> 06:58.732
I'll give you a hand. Yeah.

06:59.858 --> 07:00.973
Yeah.

07:14.458 --> 07:17.814
What do you know?
Looks like I'm going to the ball after all.

07:32.698 --> 07:35.053
- May I help you?
- You're under arrest.

07:40.978 --> 07:44.493
Someone broke into the safe
at the Hotel Peking last night.

07:45.458 --> 07:49.531
Stole cash and diamonds.
We received an anonymous tip it was you.

07:49.978 --> 07:51.969
- It was Max.
- He said it was you.

07:53.018 --> 07:55.168
You just said your tip was anonymous.

07:56.218 --> 07:57.856
Tell me about the diamonds.

07:57.938 --> 08:00.452
Well, they're a girl's best friend.

08:00.938 --> 08:03.452
Made from carbon
subjected to high pressure.

08:03.538 --> 08:06.211
Traditionally a 60th wedding
anniversary gift.

08:06.898 --> 08:08.297
And they're forever.

08:08.378 --> 08:11.973
Well, perhaps spending a few hours
in a cold cell under some hot lights

08:12.058 --> 08:14.652
will make you a little more agreeable.

08:14.978 --> 08:18.368
- Could I at least get dressed first?
- Be my guest.

08:43.778 --> 08:46.167
Would you hand me my bra, please?

09:17.138 --> 09:18.412
Do me up.

09:41.378 --> 09:42.606
Evening.

10:09.418 --> 10:11.249
Hey, you okay?

10:46.458 --> 10:48.210
Kasumi has abandoned the temple.

10:49.378 --> 10:52.734
She has become <i>shinobi</i>, an outcast.

10:54.058 --> 10:57.334
A disgrace to the clan
like her brother before her.

10:58.498 --> 11:00.250
You must follow her.

11:00.938 --> 11:03.168
Find her and kill her.

11:08.978 --> 11:13.051
Welcome to the world's greatest
martial arts tournament, DOA.

11:13.258 --> 11:17.649
<i>I'm Helena Douglas and I want</i>
<i>to thank you for accepting our invitation.</i>

11:17.818 --> 11:19.968
<i>Each of you has been individually selected</i>

11:20.058 --> 11:23.937
<i>because you represent the best</i>
<i>fighting style in your specialized field.</i>

11:24.018 --> 11:28.808
<i>Soon you will get a chance to prove</i>
<i>that you are the best fighter in the world.</i>

11:28.898 --> 11:32.208
<i>And at the same time,</i>
<i>pick up a $10 million prize.</i>

11:32.298 --> 11:36.211
<i>In the meantime,</i>
<i>relax before the real fun begins.</i>

11:36.298 --> 11:39.608
God, this is so embarrassing, Dad.
I cannot believe you're here.

11:39.698 --> 11:42.007
What? I got an invitation just like you.

11:42.098 --> 11:45.215
Tina Armstrong. Baby.

11:45.938 --> 11:47.291
So, how come you're here?

11:47.378 --> 11:50.848
That lady just said,
"The best in your fighting style."

11:51.298 --> 11:55.735
Now if I recall, you're a wrestler.
Wrestling ain't really fighting, now is it?

11:55.818 --> 11:58.810
- Don't worry, Tina, he's beneath you.
- I sure would like to be.

11:59.138 --> 12:00.776
- Son of a...
- Dad.

12:02.218 --> 12:03.537
Whatever.

12:06.498 --> 12:08.966
God, I cannot wait to kick his ass.

12:11.138 --> 12:14.813
- Why do you follow me?
- I was invited to DOA.

12:15.978 --> 12:19.448
- I promise not to harm you.
- Unless we meet in a match.

12:19.978 --> 12:22.811
- Max.
- Oh, no.

12:23.698 --> 12:24.892
Max!

12:25.578 --> 12:29.173
Listen, I don't know
who you're pretending to be

12:29.658 --> 12:32.297
or how you got yourself invited to DOA,

12:33.658 --> 12:37.856
but what I do know is you left me alone
in my Hong Kong hotel room.

12:38.658 --> 12:41.650
I would never leave
such a woman as you alone.

12:42.058 --> 12:44.253
Especially not in a hotel room.

12:44.938 --> 12:47.213
I'm winning the $10 million prize money.

12:47.298 --> 12:51.416
And if I get to put your double-dealing arse
in the "D" column of "Dead or Alive",

12:52.778 --> 12:54.496
so much the better.

12:55.618 --> 12:57.654
Let me help you with that.

12:59.498 --> 13:02.296
<i>Hey, everybody.</i>
<i>I hope you're enjoying the flight.</i>

13:02.378 --> 13:04.846
<i>My welcome gift to you is this.</i>

13:04.938 --> 13:07.975
<i>To get to DOA Island</i>
<i>you have to bail out now.</i>

13:08.298 --> 13:10.573
<i>Parachutes are under your seats.</i>

13:10.938 --> 13:14.567
<i>Just aim for the Buddha on your left.</i>
<i>Have fun.</i>

13:15.018 --> 13:16.246
<i>Oh, and one more thing.</i>

13:16.338 --> 13:19.967
<i>Whoever doesn't make it to the compound</i>
<i>by sundown is disqualified.</i>

13:26.218 --> 13:28.493
Princess, allow me to go first.

14:03.498 --> 14:05.807
Looks like we landed off target.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.773
How in hell
are we supposed to get up there?

14:13.858 --> 14:15.211
We'd better get going.

14:15.298 --> 14:18.370
Well, you're both on your own.
I don't do teams.

14:18.458 --> 14:22.371
That's fine with me. Any team you're part of
is bound to lose anyway.

14:22.458 --> 14:26.246
Well, I'll remember that
when I'm collecting the $10 million.

14:29.298 --> 14:30.936
Okay. Here goes.

14:32.538 --> 14:33.812
Race you.

15:17.098 --> 15:21.137
If we're going to make it,
we need to work together.

15:43.418 --> 15:44.487
Hey!

15:46.818 --> 15:47.967
Sorry.

16:07.578 --> 16:13.210
Oh, God, what are you doing down there?
Jesus, hurry up.

16:18.258 --> 16:19.691
We've gotta go.

16:20.698 --> 16:21.847
Thanks, guys.

16:27.418 --> 16:29.773
Hey, what took you guys so long?

16:30.498 --> 16:32.295
Who the hell is that?

16:33.218 --> 16:35.607
Trust me, you don't want to know.

16:39.498 --> 16:42.456
Welcome to DOA. Glad you made it.

16:51.578 --> 16:54.012
I'm afraid you guys were the last to arrive.

16:54.098 --> 16:58.011
Now, if you'll all follow me,
I will conduct you to the others.

17:07.258 --> 17:12.127
<i>DOA combatants, your host,</i>
<i>Dr. Victor Donovan.</i>

17:16.137 --> 17:17.856
Welcome to you all.

17:19.498 --> 17:25.095
Dead or Alive was created
by the late great Fame Douglas,

17:25.617 --> 17:28.371
Helena's father and my very good friend.

17:29.378 --> 17:31.653
Fame's will decreed this tournament,

17:31.738 --> 17:36.607
and as of this year, marking her
21st birthday, Helena's participation.

17:37.298 --> 17:39.812
My assistants will escort you to the lab

17:39.898 --> 17:42.696
where you will now undergo
a complete physical.

17:44.658 --> 17:48.173
<i>Once you pass your physicals,</i>
<i>DOA begins.</i>

17:49.418 --> 17:52.137
Hey, this thing kind of reminds me
of a disco.

17:57.178 --> 17:58.213
- Zack.
- Yo.

17:58.298 --> 18:01.176
May I please remind you
of the importance of this procedure?

18:01.258 --> 18:03.772
It's important, I know.
But you can't stop Zack, man.

18:03.858 --> 18:05.894
You can only hope to contain him a little bit.

18:11.898 --> 18:15.254
So, what do you got there,
some modern kind of dentistry chair?

18:16.978 --> 18:18.696
- I'm sorry, sweetheart.
- It's okay.

18:39.538 --> 18:43.292
Weatherby, have you got those
diagnostic reports I requested?

18:43.378 --> 18:46.814
Thank you.
And how do our contestants look?

18:47.378 --> 18:50.575
We got a strong group, sir.
They look really good.

18:51.498 --> 18:55.730
Bring up Tina Armstrong.
I was impressed with her musculature.

19:01.138 --> 19:03.254
Oh, God, this is gonna hurt.

19:03.338 --> 19:06.808
Standard procedure, Miss Armstrong.
Everyone's going through this.

19:13.098 --> 19:17.137
- Are the nanobots broadcasting?
- Perfectly. All contestants are online.

19:17.218 --> 19:19.095
All metabolic functions
and muscle movements

19:19.178 --> 19:21.055
are being broadcast
and ready to download to computer.

19:21.138 --> 19:24.016
Good. Start a contestant database.

19:27.938 --> 19:29.656
We are up and recording.

20:31.378 --> 20:35.166
<i>This is Donovan to all combatants.</i>
<i>Welcome to DOA.</i>

20:36.378 --> 20:40.735
<i>Fights can happen anytime, anyplace,</i>
<i>against anyone.</i>

20:40.818 --> 20:43.412
<i>I select match-ups</i>
<i>based on computer analyses</i>

20:43.498 --> 20:45.693
<i>of the most competitive scenarios.</i>

20:47.498 --> 20:49.932
<i>The computer will broadcast</i>
<i>your opponent's image</i>

20:50.018 --> 20:51.246
<i>to your ID bracelet.</i>

20:53.138 --> 20:57.575
<i>No weapons are allowed in a DOA fight,</i>
<i>except the human weapon.</i>

20:57.658 --> 20:59.216
<i>Get ready.</i>

21:07.298 --> 21:08.731
<i>To win,</i>

21:08.818 --> 21:12.572
<i>you must knock out your opponent.</i>
<i>Losers will be sent home.</i>

21:43.778 --> 21:45.336
<i>KO.</i>

21:46.298 --> 21:47.697
<i>Bayman wins.</i>

21:53.138 --> 21:54.696
<i>KO.</i>

21:55.298 --> 21:56.697
<i>Christie wins.</i>

22:06.418 --> 22:08.409
Hey, Helena.

22:08.898 --> 22:10.456
<i>KO.</i>

22:11.098 --> 22:12.497
<i>Helena wins.</i>

22:16.618 --> 22:20.133
<i>KO. Hayabusa wins.</i>

22:28.338 --> 22:31.489
<i>KO. Gen Fu wins.</i>

23:54.418 --> 23:58.013
Princess Kasumi, sister of Hayate.

23:58.938 --> 24:01.133
It is an honor to meet you.

24:01.898 --> 24:06.255
I came to find my brother.
I have been told he died last year at DOA.

24:07.178 --> 24:09.169
I want to know what happened.

24:09.538 --> 24:14.248
Your brother was a great and noble fighter.
He met his end with dignity.

24:15.658 --> 24:17.933
Hayate was matched against Leon.

24:24.858 --> 24:28.976
Hayate fell from this very balcony.
We never found his body.

24:30.218 --> 24:33.130
I hope you would choose to stay with us
at the tournament

24:33.218 --> 24:37.006
and fight in the same spirit
that made your brother so great.

24:41.738 --> 24:45.890
You will win DOA.
You're the best in the world.

24:46.858 --> 24:48.769
Thank you, little sister.

24:49.538 --> 24:53.975
When I leave, I will be a <i>shinobi</i>.
But I must accept this challenge.

24:54.618 --> 24:56.688
- I wish I could go with you.
- No.

24:57.338 --> 25:00.648
You have to stay and lead the clan.

25:02.098 --> 25:05.170
Farewell, Kasumi.
Hayabusa will protect you.

25:17.618 --> 25:21.657
Hayabusa, why do you invade
my privacy this way?

25:23.258 --> 25:27.171
- She is here.
- I know. I have seen her.

25:28.738 --> 25:33.812
I beg you once again, Princess.
Go home. Ask for forgiveness.

25:34.978 --> 25:37.048
You have a responsibility to your people.

25:37.138 --> 25:40.096
But I also have a responsibility
to my brother.

25:42.658 --> 25:46.776
Donavan is lying. He says Leon
killed Hayate above the Buddha head.

25:48.098 --> 25:52.216
- Why would he lie?
- I am convinced he is hiding the truth.

25:53.858 --> 25:55.894
What do you propose to do?

25:57.178 --> 25:58.736
Find my brother.

26:00.338 --> 26:04.013
Then I will help you.
Hayate was like a brother to me, too.

26:15.338 --> 26:17.090
Be careful, Kasumi.

26:32.938 --> 26:35.896
- I knew you'd miss me.
- That's presumptuous.

26:35.978 --> 26:39.448
No, it's Perrier Jouet Belle Epoch '88.
Your favorite.

26:41.098 --> 26:43.692
So how did you survive the first round?

26:43.778 --> 26:46.576
I feigned an injury so Zack went through.

26:47.498 --> 26:50.251
You know I set you up in Hong Kong
on purpose.

26:51.458 --> 26:54.370
You'd never have come here
if you'd gotten away with all that money.

26:54.458 --> 26:55.811
And you wouldn't have been invited to DOA

26:55.898 --> 26:59.049
without demolishing the pride
of the Hong Kong police.

26:59.138 --> 27:03.575
Don't tell me you want me to help you
steal the $10 million prize money.

27:03.658 --> 27:06.411
Try $100 million.

27:07.978 --> 27:10.970
Just waiting for us in a vault on the island.

27:12.258 --> 27:13.896
What's the catch?

27:13.978 --> 27:18.415
Well, we have to find the vault
and we have to crack the code. The usual.

27:20.138 --> 27:24.529
- Shall I tell you more?
- Later.

27:24.658 --> 27:29.413
Right now I'd prefer you do something else
with your mouth.

27:34.058 --> 27:37.414
Well, well, well.
Don't you just love this place?

27:45.178 --> 27:47.373
Know what I especially love?

27:49.098 --> 27:50.417
The view.

27:54.098 --> 27:56.532
- Want some?
- I'll pass.

28:00.018 --> 28:04.569
- It's been quite a day, sir.
- I want to see Kasumi in action.

28:04.658 --> 28:09.174
Her data is stronger than I expected.
Let's match her against Leon.

28:09.258 --> 28:11.931
Leon? That's harsh.

28:12.458 --> 28:16.770
Now that she's decided to stay,
let's see how she compares to her brother.

28:16.858 --> 28:18.211
All right.

28:48.778 --> 28:52.771
Before I take your life,
will you repent for leaving the clan?

28:52.858 --> 28:56.168
My only goal is to find out
what happened to my brother.

29:00.938 --> 29:02.053
Leon.

29:03.898 --> 29:05.377
Room service.

29:17.058 --> 29:18.650
You want to play, little girl?

29:45.698 --> 29:49.407
So, according to my source,
Helena is the key.

29:50.338 --> 29:52.056
Helena is the key?

29:54.898 --> 29:57.651
- I felt the earth move.
- Yeah, that's the desired effect.

29:57.738 --> 29:59.490
No, really, I felt the earth move.

30:14.978 --> 30:19.290
Come on, loosen up.
You're way too beautiful to be this tense.

30:19.698 --> 30:23.088
Maybe a little quality time with Zack
will loosen you up.

30:51.098 --> 30:53.658
You couldn't have killed my brother.

30:57.698 --> 30:59.336
Close your eyes.

31:02.338 --> 31:03.896
- Keep them closed.
- Okay.

31:03.978 --> 31:07.129
- You're wearing way too much clothing.
- Hey, now.

31:08.578 --> 31:10.933
Come to daddy. Lay it on me.

31:18.298 --> 31:19.890
Oh, shit!

31:22.578 --> 31:23.693
Tina!

31:25.698 --> 31:27.131
Quite a fight.

31:28.098 --> 31:30.692
Kasumi lives up to her brother's reputation.

31:30.778 --> 31:32.416
One quarter final spot left.

31:33.098 --> 31:36.454
Looks like a father-daughter
grudge match. Yeah.

31:37.298 --> 31:41.211
Thanks for letting me sleep here.
My room is an absolute wreck.

31:42.658 --> 31:44.614
Tina! It's show time!

31:45.378 --> 31:48.734
Dad! Not now. I'm in my underwear.

31:48.898 --> 31:50.490
Which I hate.

31:50.578 --> 31:53.536
Why you can't just sleep in the nude
like me, I'll never know.

31:54.298 --> 31:57.847
- Oh, my God.
- No. Dad, she's just another fighter.

31:57.938 --> 31:59.849
- We're just sleeping together.
- Yeah, I can see that.

31:59.938 --> 32:03.408
No, no. I mean, we're not sleeping together,

32:03.498 --> 32:05.170
we're just sleeping.

32:05.258 --> 32:08.330
It seems to be like my baby girl's found
herself a special friend.

32:09.938 --> 32:12.736
We'll settle up tomorrow, sweetie.
Nice to meet you, miss.

32:12.818 --> 32:14.376
Oh, it's Christie.

32:14.458 --> 32:16.926
- Tina's real name is Christina.
- Dad!

32:20.858 --> 32:22.576
Thanks a lot, bitch.

32:22.658 --> 32:26.617
Save your strength, sweetheart.
Big day tomorrow fighting Daddy.

32:30.578 --> 32:32.614
Dr. Donovan, you should take a look at this.

32:32.698 --> 32:36.373
Have you seen this Max character?
A DOA fighter. Yeah, right.

32:36.458 --> 32:40.212
This guy's a total fake.
We should kick him off the island.

32:40.298 --> 32:44.496
You're just worried this phony's
making the moves on your dream girl.

32:44.858 --> 32:49.409
I can have him removed from DOA island,
or I can have some fun.

32:50.018 --> 32:52.486
- Punch up Bayman.
- Good call, sir.

32:55.658 --> 32:57.649
Hey, buddy, your time's up.

33:05.898 --> 33:08.173
You know, that was an accident. I...

33:18.658 --> 33:19.727
Wow.

33:25.338 --> 33:29.729
I had the worst sleep ever last night.
Christie kept stealing all the blankets.

33:30.818 --> 33:32.695
You know, are you sure
this is such a good idea?

33:32.778 --> 33:35.451
Because those things look really sharp.

33:37.258 --> 33:40.216
Acupuncture has many medicinal qualities.

33:40.298 --> 33:43.529
But in a ninja's hands, it can be lethal.

33:48.978 --> 33:51.651
That actually feels better.

33:54.178 --> 33:55.327
Tina!

33:57.338 --> 33:58.817
Careful, baby.

33:59.298 --> 34:02.290
Sweetie? I've come at a bad time again,
haven't I?

34:03.418 --> 34:06.376
- Does Christie know about you two?
- Dad!

34:06.858 --> 34:09.531
You know what?
Let's just go ahead and get this over with.

34:09.618 --> 34:13.896
My raft, my rules.
Whoever falls in the water first loses.

34:13.978 --> 34:15.456
Fair enough, Tina.

34:30.378 --> 34:34.929
- No! Dad, you bit me!
- Sorry. Old wrestling reflex.

34:35.018 --> 34:39.136
Dad, you have to understand.
I'm here to prove that I'm not a fake.

34:40.058 --> 34:42.697
Even if that means I have to hurt you.

34:52.498 --> 34:54.170
Nice try, sweetie.

35:08.418 --> 35:11.057
Dad, you're not taking this seriously.

35:22.658 --> 35:23.693
Yes!

35:27.138 --> 35:28.253
Yeah!

35:34.018 --> 35:36.293
- That's ticklish!
- Seriously, I'm an expert...

35:36.378 --> 35:38.096
- Stop it.
- Trust me.

35:48.538 --> 35:50.210
I have a question.

35:52.098 --> 35:53.816
Do you do squats?

35:53.898 --> 35:57.174
Sorry. Just slipped right out of my hands.

35:57.258 --> 36:00.887
- We're playing volleyball, you want in?
- Yeah, let's play.

36:04.058 --> 36:06.367
If you must know, I was working.

36:06.458 --> 36:09.256
"Working it" seemed a better description.

36:13.138 --> 36:15.254
Helena and I take on all comers!

36:15.338 --> 36:17.806
Hey, Kasumi, come on,
let's go kick some ass.

36:22.818 --> 36:26.606
I just hope you're better at volleyball
than you are at seduction.

36:28.338 --> 36:31.535
Fifty says that Tina
gets her little ass stomped.

36:33.418 --> 36:38.253
You know, on second thought, why don't we
just go ahead and make it a whole dollar?

36:49.818 --> 36:51.968
Hayabusa, are you all right?

36:53.458 --> 36:54.573
Yeah.

36:58.738 --> 37:01.047
Do you think you can manage
to keep them occupied?

37:01.138 --> 37:04.687
I'd like to explore his lab.
Search for signs of Hayate.

37:04.778 --> 37:06.211
I can try.

37:09.178 --> 37:10.577
Hey, Kasumi, come on!

37:10.658 --> 37:14.936
<i>Party people gather around!</i>
<i>I hope you're enjoying the fun in the sun,</i>

37:15.018 --> 37:17.896
<i>but before the day is done</i>
<i>we got some hot action.</i>

37:17.978 --> 37:19.013
Just in time.

37:25.898 --> 37:30.255
<i>Now without further ado,</i>
<i>let's get this game started for all of you!</i>

37:30.338 --> 37:32.294
<i>DOA style! Bring it on!</i>

37:45.458 --> 37:47.494
<i>First to five wins, folks.</i>

38:21.778 --> 38:23.973
<i>Oh! This action is hot!</i>

38:43.338 --> 38:44.453
Yeah.

38:56.218 --> 39:00.006
<i>Oh, Christie with a monster smash!</i>
<i>You go, girl.</i>

39:14.618 --> 39:18.054
<i>Yes! Kasumi and Tina</i>
<i>making a comeback with that shot.</i>

39:51.578 --> 39:52.931
I must go.

40:16.618 --> 40:19.530
Ayane, I don't want to fight you!

41:02.778 --> 41:04.097
You are a <i>shinobi</i>.

41:04.178 --> 41:07.693
So was Hayate when he came here,
yet you did not pursue him.

41:08.058 --> 41:09.889
Hayate was different.

41:11.618 --> 41:13.449
Because you loved him?

41:24.098 --> 41:28.250
Hayate is in both our hearts.
Help me find out what happened to him.

41:28.858 --> 41:32.214
He's dead. Prepare to join him.

42:09.338 --> 42:12.933
Kasumi! Kasumi!

42:23.698 --> 42:26.292
The tattoo she has
is on her lower back, right?

42:26.378 --> 42:31.213
Well, I've just deciphered it
and it means "Helena". Get it?

42:31.298 --> 42:35.928
- Helena is the key. Helena must be the code.
- Max, it's brilliant.

42:37.018 --> 42:41.569
Except she had it done last year in Paris.
She's been showing it off to us.

43:19.778 --> 43:22.895
- I'm Weatherby.
- What are you doing?

43:26.498 --> 43:28.887
I work in the lab. I'm Weatherby.

43:30.778 --> 43:33.246
- Helena.
- I know.

43:38.458 --> 43:41.291
Would you like another drink?
I'll get you another drink.

43:41.378 --> 43:43.448
- I'll get you another drink, yeah.
- Thanks, Wellington.

43:43.538 --> 43:46.450
Actually, it's Weatherby.
It's a pretty funny story.

43:47.058 --> 43:49.891
My grandfather came over with his horse...

43:51.858 --> 43:53.530
- Hey, Wallaby!
- Yes?

43:53.618 --> 43:55.290
What are you doing?

43:56.498 --> 43:58.489
My grandfather came over...

44:00.258 --> 44:04.012
Hey, baby, come on, loosen up. It's a party.

44:05.738 --> 44:08.047
Come on, you know
you want to dance with me.

44:08.138 --> 44:09.491
Well, see, I'd love to.

44:09.578 --> 44:14.174
But I don't know how good you're gonna be
on the dance floor with two broken legs.

44:22.258 --> 44:25.933
So, what, you're just gonna ruin
this party for everybody?

44:30.378 --> 44:33.688
Fine. Sunrise tomorrow morning.

44:34.618 --> 44:35.494
- Forbidden Square?
- Fine.

46:06.138 --> 46:07.696
You wanna play?

47:02.938 --> 47:05.736
Boy, am I sorry I messed with you so much.

47:06.338 --> 47:09.648
From now on, I tell you,
my money is on you to win.

47:16.098 --> 47:17.770
I appreciate that.

47:19.098 --> 47:24.297
Our nanobots were working overtime
on that fight, but you were right about Tina.

47:24.978 --> 47:27.333
I have to say I did not see it coming.

47:28.178 --> 47:31.409
That leaves a showdown
between Helena and Christie.

47:31.498 --> 47:34.251
And who's your favorite to win,
Mr. Weatherby?

47:34.338 --> 47:36.647
My money's on Helena. She rocks.

47:42.938 --> 47:46.089
You were right.
She does have another tattoo.

47:50.498 --> 47:52.011
First I want a deal.

47:52.858 --> 47:54.576
- Okay.
- I want half.

47:55.658 --> 47:58.650
And if I win, I get to keep the prize money.

48:00.338 --> 48:01.737
Of course.

50:24.218 --> 50:26.095
Let me show you something.

50:31.538 --> 50:32.891
Very smart.

50:36.578 --> 50:40.856
- The vault's in the Buddha head.
- So now we just need to find a way in.

50:45.778 --> 50:49.214
<i>So, it's down to the four of us.</i>
<i>But where's Hayabusa?</i>

50:50.378 --> 50:54.610
- I haven't seen him since yesterday.
- Well, let's go find him.

50:54.898 --> 50:58.777
- No. I go alone.
- Well, I'm gonna come, too.

50:58.858 --> 51:03.170
- I said no. He means nothing to you.
- Well, now, that's not entirely true.

51:03.458 --> 51:06.211
- You know, he and I...
- You mean...

51:07.378 --> 51:10.688
Just once. He was so persistent, you know.

51:13.018 --> 51:14.656
I'm just kidding.

51:15.338 --> 51:16.930
Come on, Christie.

51:21.738 --> 51:23.615
Second floor. Follow me.

51:24.538 --> 51:26.529
<i>Weatherby, take the rest of the day off.</i>

51:26.618 --> 51:29.655
I've got some unfinished business
to attend to.

51:38.978 --> 51:41.014
Holy shit!

51:41.098 --> 51:45.808
See, when I win the money, this is exactly
the kind of office I'm gonna build.

51:48.458 --> 51:51.848
I know you.
But why are you facing that way?

52:02.778 --> 52:03.813
<i>Well done.</i>

52:03.898 --> 52:06.093
<i>Yeah, what did you say</i>
<i>your day job was?</i>

52:17.658 --> 52:21.651
That's a lot of steps. My legs are on fire.

52:27.258 --> 52:31.251
- I guess you had a pretty rough day.
- You could say that.

52:34.338 --> 52:36.294
I lost to Christie.

52:37.978 --> 52:41.015
Yeah, I saw that. But it was a close fight.

52:43.058 --> 52:46.414
You almost made it to the semi-finals
of DOA, Helena.

52:47.738 --> 52:50.377
Your father would have been very proud.

52:51.938 --> 52:55.248
- Thanks, Weatherby.
- It's Weatherby, but you don't...

53:03.498 --> 53:04.726
Wow.

53:08.258 --> 53:09.930
This looks homey.

53:12.418 --> 53:15.888
Look at this.
They've been monitoring everything we do.

53:16.378 --> 53:17.891
Bunch of pervs.

53:35.378 --> 53:36.652
Hayabusa.

53:42.138 --> 53:44.094
Hayabusa. What happened?

53:51.338 --> 53:52.566
Perfect.

53:54.458 --> 53:58.337
<i>I mean, it was amazing. Your father</i>
<i>recruited me straight out of college.</i>

53:58.418 --> 53:59.612
<i>I had no idea.</i>

53:59.698 --> 54:02.929
- That's great.
- Your father was a great man.

54:08.218 --> 54:11.051
Helena, there's something I should tell you.

54:13.098 --> 54:16.408
<i>Donovan wanted to take my research</i>
<i>into a different direction.</i>

54:16.498 --> 54:18.534
It's never gonna happen,
I can guarantee you.

54:18.618 --> 54:20.336
I did not set up DOA
for this purpose.

54:20.418 --> 54:22.249
I want to know what happened...

54:22.338 --> 54:25.375
<i>He and your father got into</i>
<i>this big argument about it.</i>

54:25.458 --> 54:26.937
You're not gonna get away
with this, Donovan.

54:27.018 --> 54:30.647
<i>Your father was so against this,</i>
<i>he decided to shut down the whole thing.</i>

54:32.058 --> 54:34.777
- So why didn't he?
- He never got a chance to.

54:35.858 --> 54:37.530
He died that night.

54:49.698 --> 54:51.848
This is Donovan to all units.

54:51.938 --> 54:57.171
<i>Proceed immediately to the Great Steps</i>
<i>and eliminate Weatherby and Helena.</i>

54:57.658 --> 55:01.173
No one is to enter the lab complex
for the rest of the day.

55:01.258 --> 55:03.374
And I mean no one.

55:06.298 --> 55:09.415
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna go see Donovan.

55:09.498 --> 55:12.808
My father didn't want him to get away with it
so neither can I. Come on.

55:12.898 --> 55:15.366
- Well, what do you want me to do?
- Protect me.

55:15.458 --> 55:19.133
That's funny. I was just about
to make the same suggestion.

55:34.138 --> 55:35.287
What the...

55:46.858 --> 55:48.655
I've got your back, Helena!

57:09.538 --> 57:11.972
That hurt. That didn't feel good.

57:12.618 --> 57:16.736
Whoa! Okay.
Well, I'm never gonna mess with you.

57:17.698 --> 57:18.847
Never?

57:20.058 --> 57:22.253
Well, maybe in a controlled environment.

57:22.338 --> 57:23.817
There's gotta be
another way into the lab.

57:23.898 --> 57:26.014
Well, that's where I come in.
Come on.

57:42.098 --> 57:43.417
Princess!

57:57.338 --> 57:59.613
Now that I have your attention,

58:00.258 --> 58:03.694
let me introduce you to the future.

58:27.178 --> 58:30.932
This is amazing. I can't believe
my father never told me about this.

58:31.018 --> 58:33.248
Well, I'm afraid that's not
the only thing you don't know.

58:33.338 --> 58:36.171
Donovan has taken my concept
and used it for his own ends.

58:36.258 --> 58:38.488
So stupid.
I should have done something earlier.

58:39.138 --> 58:42.528
Now it's time to harvest.

58:49.298 --> 58:50.287
Okay, now what?

58:50.378 --> 58:52.209
Donovan has begun the download.
We got to go!

58:52.298 --> 58:55.529
- Do you think it will really work?
- Of course! I created it!

01:00:01.338 --> 01:00:02.453
Look.

01:00:03.818 --> 01:00:05.649
- Help them.
- I'm on it. I'm on it.

01:00:05.738 --> 01:00:07.968
Come on. Come on.

01:00:08.418 --> 01:00:11.216
I've got to bypass
four security protocols to free them.

01:00:11.298 --> 01:00:12.447
Not easy.

01:00:21.338 --> 01:00:25.411
Now for the ultimate test.
The moment I've had to wait a year for.

01:00:26.618 --> 01:00:29.496
I've kept him in superb fighting condition.

01:00:30.978 --> 01:00:32.331
Send him in.

01:00:46.258 --> 01:00:48.613
Hayate! My brother.

01:01:03.698 --> 01:01:05.654
- Hayate.
- Kasumi.

01:01:08.018 --> 01:01:09.292
Kasumi!

01:01:13.618 --> 01:01:16.894
Kasumi, I was afraid
you would come looking for me.

01:01:19.218 --> 01:01:20.446
Hayabusa.

01:01:24.298 --> 01:01:26.528
How could you let this happen?

01:01:26.618 --> 01:01:30.657
- Your sister has the same strong will as you.
- Yes, she does.

01:01:31.418 --> 01:01:36.617
But she lacks that perfect blend of skills,
timing and strength

01:01:37.418 --> 01:01:40.569
that set you apart
as the world's greatest warrior.

01:01:41.458 --> 01:01:44.291
You have me. Let them go.

01:01:47.058 --> 01:01:50.687
First things first. I challenge you to a fight.

01:01:51.698 --> 01:01:54.132
You win, they all go free.

01:01:57.058 --> 01:02:01.415
If you refuse my simple request, they die.

01:02:02.298 --> 01:02:03.697
Your choice.

01:02:15.978 --> 01:02:17.616
So be it.

01:03:28.298 --> 01:03:29.526
Hayate!

01:04:15.458 --> 01:04:18.131
- No!
- Hayate!

01:04:31.658 --> 01:04:32.977
Ayane.

01:04:36.258 --> 01:04:38.214
I thought you were dead.

01:04:41.458 --> 01:04:43.653
I will never leave your side.

01:05:33.938 --> 01:05:35.769
- Come on.
- We're almost there.

01:05:46.418 --> 01:05:48.454
Buyers from around the world,

01:05:48.538 --> 01:05:51.211
I hope you've enjoyed
this live demonstration

01:05:51.298 --> 01:05:54.131
of the sheer power of this new technology.

01:05:54.618 --> 01:05:57.178
Thank you for your down payments.

01:05:57.258 --> 01:06:01.490
Transmission to you of the download
program will begin immediately.

01:06:10.978 --> 01:06:13.890
- What's going on?
- Oh, no.

01:06:14.258 --> 01:06:16.135
- This is not good.
- What's not good?

01:06:16.218 --> 01:06:19.847
Donovan's transmitting the program
to buyers across the world.

01:06:22.418 --> 01:06:24.010
I have to stop him.

01:06:46.978 --> 01:06:48.127
What?

01:06:48.218 --> 01:06:49.173
That was close.

01:06:49.298 --> 01:06:51.528
Okay, time to call the cavalry.

01:06:52.178 --> 01:06:54.646
Donavan needs to know this is over.

01:07:04.098 --> 01:07:05.417
What now?

01:07:08.098 --> 01:07:11.374
Bayman, grab the money from the vault.
Meet me outside the lab.

01:07:13.058 --> 01:07:15.777
Look! He's headed this way.

01:07:17.338 --> 01:07:19.852
I need more time to free the others.

01:07:40.298 --> 01:07:42.129
Show me the money.

01:07:48.378 --> 01:07:51.495
Oh, no, no, listen. I can explain. Look, just...

01:07:58.898 --> 01:08:01.332
You're not gonna get away
with this, Donovan.

01:08:01.418 --> 01:08:05.934
That's exactly what your father said
right before I had him killed.

01:08:33.578 --> 01:08:36.376
What a shame.
You didn't download my moves.

01:08:36.938 --> 01:08:39.247
I think I underestimated you, Helena.

01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:51.212
You believe the CIA will stop me?
I don't think so.

01:08:52.457 --> 01:08:56.087
I'll take this. All your hard work right here.

01:09:01.098 --> 01:09:04.613
By the time they get here,
this place will be dust.

01:09:07.457 --> 01:09:10.336
<i>Warning.</i>
<i>Self destruct activated.</i>

01:09:10.417 --> 01:09:14.616
Enjoy your life with your new girlfriend.
All three minutes of it.

01:09:14.698 --> 01:09:20.216
<i>Warning. Self destruct activated.</i>
<i>Please evacuate immediately.</i>

01:09:20.298 --> 01:09:21.412
Follow me.

01:09:21.497 --> 01:09:26.856
<i>Warning. Self destruct activated.</i>
<i>Please evacuate immediately.</i>

01:09:38.497 --> 01:09:44.050
<i>Warning. Self destruct activated.</i>
<i>Please evacuate immediately.</i>

01:09:47.337 --> 01:09:48.612
Take care of this.

01:09:57.898 --> 01:10:00.412
Come on. Follow me.
Donovan's getting away.

01:10:00.498 --> 01:10:02.728
<i>Please evacuate immediately.</i>

01:10:11.738 --> 01:10:13.490
Go! I'll handle him.

01:10:51.458 --> 01:10:53.653
<i>Warning. Two minutes.</i>

01:11:17.538 --> 01:11:18.687
Oh, no.

01:11:25.738 --> 01:11:26.853
Come on.

01:12:04.058 --> 01:12:06.526
Tina! Kasumi!

01:12:13.698 --> 01:12:15.814
<i>Warning. Self destruct in...</i>

01:12:35.058 --> 01:12:37.526
Come on. We got to get out of here.

01:12:45.698 --> 01:12:46.892
Oh, no.

01:12:53.698 --> 01:12:55.928
Some thief you are!
The lab is gonna explode!

01:12:56.018 --> 01:12:58.407
- Forget the money!
- No, I'm not leaving the money.

01:12:58.498 --> 01:13:01.171
- We got to go now!
- No!

01:13:34.218 --> 01:13:36.209
Ten seconds! Oh, no.

01:13:36.898 --> 01:13:39.890
- Oh, my God. Max. The money.
- Weatherby.

01:13:40.178 --> 01:13:42.567
Get out of here! It's gonna blow!

01:13:45.338 --> 01:13:47.693
- Come on. There's another way out.
- We gotta go now!

01:13:47.778 --> 01:13:49.928
- What about the money?
- Get in. It leads to the ocean.

01:13:50.018 --> 01:13:52.657
- Wallaby, the money. The money!
- This whole place is gonna explode!

01:13:52.738 --> 01:13:53.932
- Let's go!
- Come on, let's go!

01:13:54.018 --> 01:13:56.009
- Forget the money.
- I don't swim!

01:13:56.618 --> 01:13:58.017
Go! Go!

01:14:13.298 --> 01:14:14.651
Move!

01:14:19.538 --> 01:14:22.530
Oh, shit!

01:15:04.098 --> 01:15:05.167
No.

01:15:13.858 --> 01:15:15.928
- Hey!
- Boys!

01:15:23.698 --> 01:15:28.328
- What about the money?
- Well, it was either me or the money.

01:15:29.138 --> 01:15:34.087
- And Wallaby chose me.
- My name is Weatherby. Weatherby.

01:15:40.058 --> 01:15:42.413
Oh, for God's sakes, get a room!

01:16:13.578 --> 01:16:16.615
Don't you think that guy
in the second row is cute?

01:16:16.698 --> 01:16:19.895
Is there a guy in this world
you don't have a crush on?

01:16:20.418 --> 01:16:24.013
You can have him,
but what about the other 300?

01:16:27.578 --> 01:16:29.489
Why don't we just split them up evenly?

01:16:30.305 --> 01:16:36.780
