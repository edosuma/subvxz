Caleb: <i>Tracks lead south.</i>

00:38.374 --> 00:40.511
15, maybe 20 men.

00:40.546 --> 00:42.985
But it don't look like
regular army to me, you know?

00:45.825 --> 00:48.596
Tallmadge. They went south.

00:48.631 --> 00:50.601
Yeah, well, it doesn't
matter. We were too late.

00:50.635 --> 00:53.946
We were late? No, we were lucky.

00:53.981 --> 00:56.421
What, you wanted to turn
up in time for all of this?

00:56.455 --> 00:58.356
The Lord's watching out for us, Ben.

00:59.826 --> 01:02.498
It's like that word your
father used to preach about.

01:02.532 --> 01:04.099
What's that word?

01:04.134 --> 01:06.671
- Providence.
- Yeah, providence.

01:06.705 --> 01:07.940
Look at that.

01:07.974 --> 01:11.182
I found that on the lieutenant there.

01:11.216 --> 01:14.053
Turns out Washington decided
to pardon Hewlett after all,

01:14.087 --> 01:16.895
but the day before these
poor bastards executed him.

01:16.929 --> 01:19.669
And in doing so they've all but signed

01:19.703 --> 01:22.442
the execution order for Abraham in New York.

01:23.410 --> 01:25.216
God, huh? God's watching?

01:25.250 --> 01:28.591
- He's laughing at us.
- Hey, Abe isn't dead yet, all right?

01:28.626 --> 01:32.102
Without Hewlett's word, Abe will hang.

01:35.643 --> 01:38.383
- Three days.
- What?

01:38.417 --> 01:41.523
It'll take three days for news of
this to reach New York at least.

01:41.557 --> 01:44.995
- Yeah, so?
- So we've got three whole days to get into the city,

01:45.029 --> 01:48.065
break Woody out of jail, and
haul his ass back to safety.

01:48.099 --> 01:49.634
- <i> Yeah, three whole days.</i>
- That's right.

01:49.668 --> 01:52.170
Because it only took us three
months to properly infiltrate

01:52.205 --> 01:54.074
a man onto the island in
the first place, right?

01:54.108 --> 01:58.580
Yeah. Well, that was your
plan. This one's mine.

02:03.692 --> 02:05.729
( Chatter )

02:16.352 --> 02:17.689
<i>( branches snapping )</i>

02:19.492 --> 02:21.194
Cold!

02:21.228 --> 02:23.765
Hungry!

02:23.799 --> 02:26.303
<i>We spotted some footprints, Captain,</i>

02:26.337 --> 02:28.208
<i>but they have all their toes.</i>

02:28.243 --> 02:29.644
He can't have gone far.

02:29.678 --> 02:32.145
There ain't a living creature out there.

02:32.179 --> 02:34.549
<i>Ain't no creature 'cept us.</i>

02:34.583 --> 02:38.249
And a pair of frozen cows.
Died recent by their look.

02:40.752 --> 02:44.353
Recall Akinbode. Have
him meet us at the shore.

02:45.388 --> 02:46.989
We're sailing on to Oyster Bay

02:47.023 --> 02:48.723
with orders from Major John André

02:48.757 --> 02:50.456
to hunt down some hidden rebels there.

02:50.490 --> 02:54.195
- Sir?
- Hewlett's no frontiersman.

02:54.229 --> 02:56.563
He could never have
eluded us in good health.

02:56.597 --> 03:01.269
<i>I expect the snowmelt to
reveal his body somewhere.</i>

03:01.304 --> 03:04.335
<i>Perhaps we'll return here in the spring.</i>

Ben: <i>I thought that Sackett moved</i>

04:27.978 --> 04:30.179
-<i> all of his devices to Valley Forge.</i>
- Mostly did.

04:30.213 --> 04:32.181
But not all his treasures
could fit in his wagon.

04:32.215 --> 04:34.347
Including...

04:37.316 --> 04:39.917
our way into New York Harbor.

04:39.951 --> 04:42.218
- My God, is this...
- Yeah.

04:42.252 --> 04:44.351
Davey Bushnell's underwater machine.

04:44.386 --> 04:46.218
The Turtle, he calls it.

04:46.252 --> 04:47.451
The Turtle?

04:47.486 --> 04:50.488
I knew Bushnell at Yale.

04:50.523 --> 04:52.190
I can't recall much about the man

04:52.224 --> 04:53.957
other than stories that he exploded

04:53.991 --> 04:55.657
kegs of gunpowder on the Mill River.

04:55.691 --> 04:58.158
Like the one you're touching now?

04:58.192 --> 05:01.593
150 pounds of powder fired by a gunlock.

05:01.627 --> 05:04.262
You see, you yank that there

05:04.297 --> 05:07.132
and then a watchwork timer,
it ignites the magazine.

05:07.166 --> 05:10.468
Then you got 10 minutes to
row away before it goes boom.

05:10.503 --> 05:13.235
My God.

05:13.270 --> 05:16.372
I thought that Sackett wouldn't
let you touch this thing.

05:16.406 --> 05:19.041
Let's just say I grew on the bastard.

05:19.076 --> 05:21.379
Yeah, I'm sure you did.

05:21.413 --> 05:24.245
How on earth do you navigate
this while underwater?

05:24.278 --> 05:28.614
Ah, Ben Franklin suggested to Sackett

05:28.648 --> 05:30.846
to coat the gauges with foxfire.

05:30.881 --> 05:32.148
You know, from dead trees.

05:32.182 --> 05:35.085
<i>So now the compass glows in the dark.</i>

05:35.120 --> 05:38.117
And I'll be damned, Benny, but it works.

05:42.635 --> 05:45.199
All right.

05:45.234 --> 05:48.735
All right, well, I'm coming with you.

05:49.704 --> 05:51.738
Sorry, but it's a one-man craft.

05:51.772 --> 05:53.572
Tight as a fish's arsehole in there.

05:53.606 --> 05:55.941
You can ride along on
the whaleboat if you like

05:55.975 --> 05:57.809
as it tows me into harbor,
but once we get close...

05:57.843 --> 05:59.477
Wait, if there's only room for one,

05:59.511 --> 06:01.044
then how the hell do you get Abe back?

06:01.078 --> 06:03.346
I said it was myay into New York, Ben.

06:03.381 --> 06:05.149
Never said it was my way out.

06:06.518 --> 06:08.618
No, Caleb, I'm sorry. I
can't let you do this alone.

06:08.653 --> 06:10.686
That's all right, Benny.

06:10.720 --> 06:12.687
'Cause I ain't asking your permission.

06:12.722 --> 06:15.256
Our little spy ring might be done for,

06:15.290 --> 06:16.857
but Abe is still alive.

06:16.892 --> 06:18.993
And you know I'd do the same for you.

06:19.028 --> 06:22.299
So let's get that bastard in the water.

06:23.768 --> 06:27.767
This, gentlemen, will be
the last battle of the war.

06:27.801 --> 06:30.095
You mean for them or for us?

06:30.129 --> 06:33.030
Their ships will sail into the river
and reinforce the garrison.

06:33.064 --> 06:35.061
Yes, I should hope so.

06:35.096 --> 06:38.295
Our main force will
cross into Staten Island,

06:38.330 --> 06:40.429
march up its eastern coast,

06:40.463 --> 06:42.093
and with their fleet occupied,

06:42.127 --> 06:45.861
you will be free to cross
the narrows into Brooklyn.

06:45.895 --> 06:48.127
It's precisely what Howe
did not two years ago.

06:48.161 --> 06:50.494
I will take a good idea
wherever it comes from.

06:50.529 --> 06:52.194
He did it in August, not the dead of winter.

06:52.229 --> 06:54.795
All the more reason they
won't be expecting us.

06:59.168 --> 07:03.401
I assure you, the whole of
the king's troops in New York

07:03.436 --> 07:07.104
does not exceed 3,500 men.

07:10.572 --> 07:13.141
How did you come by this intelligence?

07:14.577 --> 07:17.647
Are you certain it's accurate?

07:17.682 --> 07:20.248
- Completely.
- ( whispers )

07:20.282 --> 07:22.217
Because you risk the entire army.

07:22.252 --> 07:25.787
If you're not up to leading
the men, Charles, then I will.

07:30.659 --> 07:32.359
Excuse me.

07:42.571 --> 07:44.939
- Your Excellency.
- Marquis.

07:50.211 --> 07:53.111
Tell me, Lafayette, did
Albany agree with you?

07:53.145 --> 07:54.945
I confess I never made it there.

07:54.979 --> 07:57.046
I was summoned to Boston instead.

07:57.081 --> 07:58.281
Who summoned you?

07:58.316 --> 08:01.486
Conrad Gérard, the new
emissary from Versailles.

08:03.689 --> 08:05.756
I hope you expressed my deep regret

08:05.791 --> 08:07.759
at the loss of his predecessor

08:07.793 --> 08:10.863
as well as the vital
intelligence he was carrying.

08:10.897 --> 08:13.499
That was not the purpose of
the meeting, I assure you.

08:13.533 --> 08:17.166
He wished me to convey a
message to you personally.

08:18.636 --> 08:20.971
King Louis has commenced negotiations

08:21.006 --> 08:22.873
with Messieurs Franklin and Adams

08:22.907 --> 08:24.741
of the American delegation.

08:26.042 --> 08:27.341
Negotiations?

08:27.375 --> 08:30.038
A treaty of alliance between France

08:30.072 --> 08:32.842
and the United States is imminent.

08:36.514 --> 08:39.879
The number of regulars
taken prisoner at Saratoga,

08:39.914 --> 08:42.780
in particular, has earned
King Louis' support

08:42.813 --> 08:46.085
and the admiration of Parliament.

08:50.989 --> 08:52.892
Man: <i> Fire!</i>

08:52.926 --> 08:55.660
( men cheering )

09:14.277 --> 09:17.076
<i>( cannons firing )</i>

09:33.219 --> 09:34.687
Man: <i> Fire!</i>

09:34.722 --> 09:36.625

09:45.203 --> 09:48.468

09:59.316 --> 10:00.850
<i>( overlapping chatter )</i>

10:00.884 --> 10:02.318
Would you stand back, William?

10:02.353 --> 10:04.487
- Two. Two.
- Two sons? All right, just stop.

10:04.522 --> 10:05.655
Back off, all right?

10:05.689 --> 10:07.489
Just back off. I can't breathe.

10:07.524 --> 10:09.691
If you want some counsel, you've just
got to give me some room, all right?

10:09.725 --> 10:12.128
I'm dealing with this gentleman
first. You, come here.

10:12.163 --> 10:15.331
All right, so, corruption of blood,
do you know what that means?

10:15.365 --> 10:17.899
- Man: <i> No.</i>
-<i> It means you cannot transfer your property</i>

10:17.933 --> 10:19.700
<i>to your sons before the British seize it.</i>

10:19.735 --> 10:21.569
Man: <i>Corruption of blood?</i>

10:21.603 --> 10:23.570
Now, do you have a brother
that you can count on?

10:23.605 --> 10:25.238
He's the reason I'm here.

10:25.273 --> 10:27.274
All right, well, a cousin, a relative...

10:27.308 --> 10:30.473
Don't believe a word that comes
out of this Tory bastard's mouth.

10:31.707 --> 10:33.309
I'd rather be a Tory than a snitch, Gareth.

10:33.343 --> 10:34.611
Shut your gob, Gareth.

10:34.645 --> 10:36.780
- Man #2: <i> Shut it, Gareth.</i>
- Boys! Boys, look!

10:36.815 --> 10:40.786
"King Louis to make treaty
with illegal Congress."

10:40.821 --> 10:42.421
<i>The French have joined.</i>

10:42.456 --> 10:44.488
No, no. Where? Where? Where? Where?

10:44.523 --> 10:46.389
( Man laughs )

10:46.423 --> 10:47.857
Whatcha think of that, Woodhull?

10:47.891 --> 10:49.293
I think it changes everything...

10:49.327 --> 10:51.529
- ( man laughs )
- for your side.

10:55.104 --> 10:57.749
__

10:57.749 --> 11:00.516
Peggy: <i>The French? Are you certain?</i>

11:00.550 --> 11:02.284
General Gates fears the French

11:02.318 --> 11:04.352
will position their navy
between here and New York,

11:04.386 --> 11:06.519
in which case we'll be cut off.

11:08.088 --> 11:12.158
He's ordered the army to
evacuate Philadelphia.

11:14.761 --> 11:17.096
You're leaving?

11:20.235 --> 11:23.002
Well, New York has its charms.

11:23.036 --> 11:25.734
Not that I'm quite certain what they are.

11:28.805 --> 11:30.670
But I know we'll be happy there.

11:30.704 --> 11:33.106
- We?
- I'm going with you.

11:33.140 --> 11:35.142
Your father will never abandon this city.

11:35.177 --> 11:38.848
John, I am going with you.

11:45.590 --> 11:47.257
You wish to elope?

11:47.291 --> 11:50.797
I wish to be with the man I love.

11:50.831 --> 11:52.832
I'll elope if I must.

11:52.866 --> 11:55.097
It will make you a stranger to your family.

11:55.132 --> 11:57.333
They will shun you. They will disown you.

11:57.368 --> 11:59.505
I don't care.

12:07.817 --> 12:11.621
They may abandon you, but I won't.

12:12.490 --> 12:15.724
Your husband will be your new family.

12:25.862 --> 12:27.729
Don't mind me.

12:27.763 --> 12:30.528
I'm just enjoying the show.

12:30.563 --> 12:32.362
How did you get in here?

12:32.397 --> 12:34.397
( laughs )

12:35.566 --> 12:38.833
Major Robert Rogers

12:38.867 --> 12:40.399
of the King's Rangers.

12:40.433 --> 12:43.935
- And you would be, eh?
- Don't answer him.

12:43.969 --> 12:45.503
I'll wait upstairs.

12:45.537 --> 12:47.568
Ah. ( laughs )

12:47.603 --> 12:49.567
- John.
- Don't worry.

12:49.601 --> 12:51.065
He won't test me any further.

12:51.100 --> 12:52.965
He's smarter than he looks.

12:55.167 --> 12:58.037
Oh, this Philly filly

12:58.072 --> 13:00.840
ain't no common actress.

13:00.875 --> 13:03.571
I smell a secret.

13:03.606 --> 13:07.640
I find it hard to believe you
can smell anything past yourself.

13:10.110 --> 13:13.848
Secrets can kill, you know, John.

13:13.882 --> 13:16.519
<i>I have a license to kill anyone</i>

13:16.553 --> 13:20.086
who's seen the secrets
on this piece of paper.

13:20.121 --> 13:22.387
Do you want to take a peek?

13:22.422 --> 13:24.555
Do you even know what this is, John?

13:24.589 --> 13:26.358
According to the letter
I received from London,

13:26.392 --> 13:28.462
I'm assuming it's the property of our king

13:28.496 --> 13:31.198
stolen from his throne
room by an American spy.

13:31.233 --> 13:34.303
And retrieved by me.

13:35.607 --> 13:37.975
What else has London told you?

13:38.010 --> 13:41.048
Only that I'm to verify the seal
and witness you destroy it.

13:41.082 --> 13:44.020
And see that I'm paid, John.

13:44.054 --> 13:45.455
Ha!

13:45.489 --> 13:49.458
That part burns you just
a wee bit, doesn't it?

13:49.492 --> 13:51.963
I received the letter four months ago.

13:51.997 --> 13:54.864
I wonder what took you
so long to lay hand to it.

13:54.897 --> 13:57.365
Well, I'd explain it to you,

13:57.400 --> 14:02.068
but with your lack of field experience,

14:02.102 --> 14:05.903
I somehow doubt that
you'd comprehend a lick.

14:05.937 --> 14:07.637
Let's get this over and done with.

14:07.672 --> 14:09.438
I want my payment in gold.

14:09.472 --> 14:11.707
I'm authorized to extend a line of credit.

14:11.741 --> 14:14.309
In gold.

14:14.343 --> 14:16.675
I'm off for the Northwest Passage.

14:16.709 --> 14:19.111
Far away from this army.

14:19.145 --> 14:21.446
Far away from this war.

14:21.480 --> 14:24.446
I somehow doubt that the
emperors of the Orient

14:24.481 --> 14:27.714
will accept a letter of credit.

14:31.520 --> 14:33.487
Give us a day to collect the bullion.

14:33.521 --> 14:35.455
You can claim it at the customshouse.

14:39.694 --> 14:42.163
It does burn you, doesn't it?

14:43.699 --> 14:46.970
Good luck with your evacuation.

weren't gonna turn up.

don't try and pawn your
worthless dollars off on me again.

15:24.342 --> 15:27.977

Take me back to Setauket

15:49.669 --> 15:52.505

20:03.717 --> 20:06.185
I think it they who should be toasting us.

20:06.220 --> 20:09.123
Providence is on our side, not the papists.

20:09.157 --> 20:12.358
We're all on the same side now.

20:12.392 --> 20:13.925
Well...

20:13.960 --> 20:16.360
providence favors the righteous.

20:16.395 --> 20:18.395
And the bold.

20:18.429 --> 20:20.893
Are we to carry out the attack on New York?

20:22.428 --> 20:24.596
Circumstances have changed.

20:24.631 --> 20:27.431
The enemy's as well as ours.

20:28.732 --> 20:31.201
Philadelphia

20:31.235 --> 20:33.438
will soon be recovered.

20:34.905 --> 20:37.207
And I wish you to serve

20:37.242 --> 20:41.312
as military commandant of the city.

20:42.514 --> 20:46.017
I've longed to drive them from the capital.

20:46.052 --> 20:48.184
House by house if need be.

20:48.219 --> 20:49.919
There shall be no such need.

20:49.953 --> 20:53.992
The regulars will soon be evacuating
to New York within the week.

20:54.026 --> 20:55.392
And am I to pursue them?

20:55.427 --> 20:58.431
That task falls to the army in the field.

21:03.736 --> 21:05.907
How long am I

21:05.941 --> 21:08.512
to remain in Philadelphia?

21:08.546 --> 21:09.747
How long?

21:09.781 --> 21:12.484
Well, surely you understand my concern.

21:12.518 --> 21:14.186
No, I'm afraid I don't.

21:14.221 --> 21:17.522
This is the promotion you've long sought.

21:17.556 --> 21:19.192
Who the hell am I going to fight

21:19.227 --> 21:23.993
from behind my glorious
desk in Philadelphia?

21:24.028 --> 21:25.763
You know, the French wouldn't even be here

21:25.797 --> 21:28.164
if it weren't for my victory at Saratoga.

21:28.198 --> 21:30.665
And it was <i> my</i> victory,

21:30.699 --> 21:33.870
no matter what laurels General
Gates lays at his own feet.

21:33.904 --> 21:35.036
This isn't about Gates.

21:35.070 --> 21:36.603
But he's behind this, isn't he?

21:36.637 --> 21:38.437
Gates or Lee.

21:38.472 --> 21:41.006
Or those Judases in Congress.

21:41.041 --> 21:43.610
The decision is mine.

21:48.681 --> 21:50.950
You need more time to recuperate.

21:52.620 --> 21:55.922
You are a commander who joins the fray

21:55.956 --> 21:58.559
and engages the enemy personally.

21:58.594 --> 22:01.431
If you can't lead by example,

22:01.466 --> 22:03.634
your men will lose heart.

22:04.834 --> 22:09.340
The men are mindful of my leg, sir.

22:09.374 --> 22:11.644
But it gives them heart.

22:11.678 --> 22:13.612
It reminds them of victory

22:13.647 --> 22:16.784
and the sacrifice that victory requires.

22:18.788 --> 22:21.158
I can fight.

22:21.192 --> 22:23.325
Let me prove it to you.

22:23.360 --> 22:26.596
And I assure you that my glory
will not detract from your own.

22:26.630 --> 22:28.734
It will only enhance it.

22:38.075 --> 22:41.677
This has nothing to do with glory.

22:44.115 --> 22:46.685
Says the glorified.

22:52.827 --> 22:53.893
Right, right.

22:55.796 --> 22:59.134
Well, the inventor,
he called it an Infernal.

22:59.168 --> 23:00.736
And by God, was he right.

23:00.771 --> 23:02.406
I sent a man for rope.

23:02.440 --> 23:04.441
<i>Perhaps we'll hang you with it.</i>

23:04.476 --> 23:06.042

It's been 10 minutes by my count.

25:48.617 --> 25:50.283
You have a visitor.

25:53.687 --> 25:56.188
You're going to wish you had confessed.

26:00.525 --> 26:02.992
Yates: <i>He don't look like much, sir,</i>

26:03.026 --> 26:05.327
but he's a snake in the grass.

26:05.362 --> 26:08.801
Thank you, Warden. I'll take it from here.

26:17.382 --> 26:19.453

26:22.291 --> 26:24.527
Huh?

26:26.063 --> 26:27.698
( Grunts )

26:28.901 --> 26:30.603
- Look at you.
- ( chuckles )

26:30.637 --> 26:33.139
- Look at those whiskers.
- Where the hell did yours go?

26:33.173 --> 26:35.543
- Mine came off.
- ( laughs )

26:35.578 --> 26:37.645
What are you doing here?

26:37.680 --> 26:39.881
What do you mean, what am I doing here?

26:39.915 --> 26:41.916
I'm here to save your bacon.

26:41.950 --> 26:44.449
You're walking out that door today, huh?

26:44.484 --> 26:47.051
Right through the city gates
and all the way to Valley Forge.

26:47.085 --> 26:48.819
- No.
- What?

26:48.853 --> 26:50.520
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

26:50.554 --> 26:51.887
- I mean you have to go.
- What?

26:51.922 --> 26:53.988
- You have... shh.
- No. No.

26:54.023 --> 26:56.754
- What, without you?
- They still think I'm a Loyalist.

26:56.788 --> 26:59.391
- I've maintained innocence and my story.
- Abe, but...

26:59.427 --> 27:01.593
And when Hewlett gets traded
back and he writes to them,

27:01.628 --> 27:02.894
that story will be intact.

27:02.929 --> 27:06.968
- You have to go.
- Listen, Hewlett is dead.

27:09.539 --> 27:11.542
What?

27:11.576 --> 27:14.013
He's dead.

27:14.047 --> 27:15.982
Are you... Are you certain?

27:17.017 --> 27:18.819
Are you certain?

27:18.853 --> 27:21.689
- I stood over his grave.
- ( sighs )

27:21.723 --> 27:24.827
Now look, we rode out to Connecticut

27:24.862 --> 27:26.497
to free him, right?

27:26.531 --> 27:28.398
We did all we could.

27:28.432 --> 27:30.365
Washington even wrote the man a pardon,

27:30.399 --> 27:32.401
but it was too late.

27:32.436 --> 27:35.502
Now look,

27:35.537 --> 27:37.571
Culper is dead.

27:38.707 --> 27:40.741
But you don't have to be.

27:42.643 --> 27:45.542
Now let's get out of here.

27:45.577 --> 27:48.579
Come on. Come on.

27:50.482 --> 27:51.815
- No.
- What are you doing?

27:51.850 --> 27:54.084
- Abe...
- No, no, there is still a chance.

27:55.455 --> 27:58.125
Did you... did you not
hear what I just said?

27:58.159 --> 28:00.227
If they were going to kill me,
they would have done it already.

28:00.262 --> 28:02.631
This place, this prison is a business.

28:02.665 --> 28:04.401
All right? Yates gets a stipend

28:04.437 --> 28:07.037
for each person that's in here,
but it's not enough to turn a profit.

28:07.071 --> 28:09.338
So for that, he relies
on family gifts, bribes.

28:09.373 --> 28:12.909
Mary, she sends provisions, cutlery,

28:12.944 --> 28:15.146
guineas every week like clockwork.

28:15.180 --> 28:17.883
So if I die, so does his revenue, all right?

28:17.917 --> 28:21.523
I'm not even sure if he's told the
commissary that I'm even a spy yet.

28:21.558 --> 28:22.992
Do you know what I had to do to get in here?

28:23.027 --> 28:24.828
What the hell are you doing?
I didn't ask you to come here.

28:24.862 --> 28:27.798
I shaved off my beard for
you, you ungrateful shite.

28:29.666 --> 28:31.333
- Well, you missed a spot.
- What are you doing?

28:31.367 --> 28:34.035
Washington pardoned Hewlett.

28:34.069 --> 28:36.904
That means that he still
holds out hope for me, for us.

28:36.938 --> 28:39.139
And now that the French
have joined our cause,

28:39.173 --> 28:42.241
the British will relocate their
headquarters to New York.

28:42.276 --> 28:45.840
Our operation is needed
here now more than ever.

28:45.875 --> 28:47.075
Do you understand?

28:48.377 --> 28:50.578
Lower the knife.

28:52.913 --> 28:55.812
Now you listen to me, Woodhull.

28:55.847 --> 28:58.650
If you do make it out of here
Tory bona fides and all,

28:58.684 --> 29:02.089
there is no way Samuel Culper can
skulk around in New York in the future.

29:02.123 --> 29:03.657
That's why we need a man here.

29:03.691 --> 29:05.659
I've already told Ben about him.

29:06.961 --> 29:08.429
- What, Townsley?
- Townsend.

29:08.463 --> 29:10.831
His name's Townsend. He owns
a boardinghouse in the Bowery.

29:10.865 --> 29:12.732
I left my bag there before I was arrested.

29:12.767 --> 29:15.601
- All right, slow down.
- Hidden in the bottom of it is a vial of invisible ink.

29:15.636 --> 29:17.102
You need to get that ink to him.

29:17.136 --> 29:19.102
You need to show him how to use it.

29:21.005 --> 29:22.206
What if he doesn't take it?

29:22.241 --> 29:23.975
You're gonna have to convince him.

29:24.009 --> 29:26.510
But I know this man.

29:27.512 --> 29:29.946
He is the answer to our problem.

29:29.980 --> 29:32.350
And Culper is not dead.

29:32.385 --> 29:35.052
Neither is our ring.

29:37.887 --> 29:40.122
It's just not completed yet.

29:47.536 --> 29:49.706
<i>( Clock ticking )</i>

29:49.740 --> 29:52.176
<i>( fire crackling )</i>

30:02.456 --> 30:06.389
I pray you've not been attending
me this entire day, Mrs. Woodhull.

30:08.291 --> 30:10.325
It was no trouble.

30:10.359 --> 30:12.825
How do you feel?

30:12.860 --> 30:14.759
Oh, wretched.

30:14.793 --> 30:16.958
But I no longer despair.

30:22.326 --> 30:26.293
I never thought to have a roof over me.

30:26.327 --> 30:28.865
Never sleep in my own bed.

30:30.433 --> 30:32.232
It's good to be home.

30:36.636 --> 30:39.003
Richard.

30:39.038 --> 30:41.505
Glad to see you, old friend.

30:41.540 --> 30:45.074
I'm so sorry that you got
caught up in all of this, Richard.

30:45.108 --> 30:48.405
- You and your family.
- You have nothing to apologize for.

30:48.440 --> 30:50.675
We recovered from it as will you.

30:50.709 --> 30:53.141
And now, if there's anything
I can do to be of service...

30:53.176 --> 30:55.777
You already have. You've kept
the town running in my stead.

30:55.811 --> 30:59.645
- Well, it wasn't just me.
- No doubt young Abraham was helpful, too.

31:01.281 --> 31:04.552
Abraham remains in New York.

31:04.587 --> 31:06.254
<i>What?</i>

31:06.288 --> 31:08.788
I take it his studies are going well.

31:10.091 --> 31:12.691
He's been in prison this whole time.

31:14.261 --> 31:15.828
They say he's been spying.

31:15.863 --> 31:18.798
<i>But I know that this is some
kind of misunderstanding.</i>

31:20.734 --> 31:22.700
Indeed there is, Mrs. Woodhull.

31:22.735 --> 31:24.767
He was operating under my sanction.

31:24.802 --> 31:27.736
Have you not communicated
with the authorities, Richard?

31:27.770 --> 31:31.073
As a father, I feared my testimony

31:31.108 --> 31:33.308
would be perceived as biased.

31:33.343 --> 31:36.778
Fortunately the major has no such bias.

31:36.812 --> 31:39.046
I will write to his jailers

31:39.081 --> 31:41.650
and order them to release him.

31:41.684 --> 31:46.350
But there is another matter
that I must attend to first

31:46.384 --> 31:49.054
now that I've recovered some strength.

31:55.895 --> 31:59.730
<i>- ( Carriage wheels rattling )
- ( horse neighs )</i>

32:02.630 --> 32:05.798
I was thinking of taking some
of Mr. Franklin's inventions

32:05.832 --> 32:07.964
<i>as mementos from my time here.</i>

32:07.998 --> 32:10.033
Is that really necessary, John?

32:10.068 --> 32:13.503
What better memento could you
have of this place than a wife?

32:19.147 --> 32:20.580
Something the matter?

32:20.614 --> 32:23.980
Not for me. It's for General Arnold.

32:24.014 --> 32:26.114
I would think he'd be
crowing about the French.

32:26.148 --> 32:28.782
To the contrary. He seems melancholic.

32:28.816 --> 32:31.185
"I do not relish the coming of spring.

32:31.220 --> 32:33.556
<i>I would prefer the hardships of the field</i>

32:33.590 --> 32:35.256
<i>to the comforts of the city.</i>

32:35.290 --> 32:37.122
Yet if glory is beyond my grasp,

32:37.156 --> 32:40.761
my sole consolation will be
to resume our acquaintance

32:40.795 --> 32:44.533
and cast my eyes upon you on a daily basis."

32:53.408 --> 32:55.743
They're giving him Philadelphia.

32:56.711 --> 32:59.012
He's coming here?

33:01.918 --> 33:03.955
John, what's wrong?

33:05.323 --> 33:07.553
This could be a blessing in disguise.

33:09.056 --> 33:10.457
Margaret...

33:10.491 --> 33:13.059
Why are you calling me that?

33:18.236 --> 33:20.738
I need you to remain here.

33:20.773 --> 33:24.577
To befriend Arnold and
make an introduction to me.

33:24.611 --> 33:27.212
Remain here?

33:27.246 --> 33:29.884
I... I thought we were going to be together.

33:29.918 --> 33:31.518
We shall be.

33:31.553 --> 33:33.788
And with the blessing of your father.

33:33.822 --> 33:37.090
<i>The man who contrives the
defection of Arnold will be lauded,</i>

33:37.124 --> 33:39.124
hailed as the savior of the colonies.

33:39.158 --> 33:41.089
I'll be given land and title,

33:41.123 --> 33:43.791
all the things your father thinks I lack.

33:45.195 --> 33:48.826
What if Benedict Arnold
doesn't want my friendship?

33:48.860 --> 33:50.528
I suppose there's a first
time for everything.

33:50.563 --> 33:53.031
I mean, what if he wants something more?

33:54.065 --> 33:56.499
Peggy, you are an expert

33:56.533 --> 33:59.470
in the art of fending off an ardent suitor.

33:59.504 --> 34:01.503
And you can look to your father for help.

34:01.537 --> 34:03.137
If he found my pedigree lacking,

34:03.171 --> 34:06.674
I can only imagine what he would
think of an apothecary's son.

34:12.683 --> 34:15.184
Peggy...

34:15.219 --> 34:17.454
don't you understand?

34:17.489 --> 34:19.793
We wouldn't have to elope.

34:21.931 --> 34:24.764
Make me a man you can marry

34:24.799 --> 34:27.032
and your father will give me your hand.

34:50.491 --> 34:52.425
Planning to sketch me?

34:52.458 --> 34:55.260
Trying to commit you to memory.

34:55.295 --> 34:58.594
You have drawings of me, but I
have nothing to remember you by.

35:20.083 --> 35:22.583
My great-great-grandmother
was forbidden to marry

35:22.617 --> 35:24.485
the man she loved, yet
they ended up together.

35:24.519 --> 35:26.354
Then there is precedent.

35:26.388 --> 35:28.790
She wed him in secret.

35:28.824 --> 35:30.225
They were Quakers.

35:30.259 --> 35:32.660
They didn't require a
meetinghouse or a clergyman,

35:32.694 --> 35:37.035
just a simple vow such as we are married.

35:37.070 --> 35:39.204
And it wouldn't matter that
there were no witnesses,

35:39.238 --> 35:42.172
- for the only ones needed to be...
- We are married.

35:44.845 --> 35:47.046
If you'll have me, that is.

35:49.549 --> 35:52.616
Yes, we are married.

36:18.440 --> 36:21.609
<i>( Wind whistling )</i>

36:21.644 --> 36:24.179
<i>( horse neighing )</i>

36:25.348 --> 36:26.716
<i>( lock clicks )</i>

36:44.423 --> 36:46.911
<i>( Birds screeching )</i>

36:52.023 --> 36:54.323
Anna: <i>I'm sorry, we've closed.</i>

36:54.357 --> 36:56.891
<i>( silverware clinking )</i>

36:56.926 --> 36:59.662
I've just returned from a long journey.

36:59.696 --> 37:02.365
I'm in need of a drink.

37:03.435 --> 37:06.040
Where is the major?

37:06.074 --> 37:08.709
Perhaps you should be seated.

37:10.144 --> 37:11.980
He didn't return?

37:12.014 --> 37:15.152
I did my best, Mrs. Strong.

37:15.187 --> 37:17.421
The brutes murdered
Hewlett before we arrived.

37:17.455 --> 37:19.357
- ( Crying )
- My sole consolation

37:19.392 --> 37:21.762
was meting out the same rough
treatment they'd given him.

37:21.797 --> 37:23.767
I even sustained this wound.

37:23.801 --> 37:25.636
( Sobbing )

37:29.709 --> 37:32.446
I'm here to console you

37:32.480 --> 37:35.316
if you so require.

37:35.350 --> 37:37.450
You're not alone.

37:41.887 --> 37:44.354
Good evening, Mrs. Strong.

37:51.794 --> 37:53.829
I thought you were lost.

37:53.863 --> 37:56.362
I feared for you, too.

37:58.768 --> 38:00.704
Major.

38:04.205 --> 38:07.307
- This is...
- Somewhat of a surprise?

38:10.776 --> 38:13.311
I did everything I could to rescue you,

38:13.346 --> 38:15.515
as my men will attest.

38:19.120 --> 38:21.556
I have no doubt of it.

38:21.590 --> 38:24.727
But I outwitted the rebels

38:24.761 --> 38:26.429
and escaped.

38:28.031 --> 38:29.665
Were you injured, Captain?

38:29.699 --> 38:32.370
Was it the young rebel lieutenant?

38:32.404 --> 38:35.174
An adversary of no consequence.

38:35.209 --> 38:36.643
Hmm.

38:36.678 --> 38:40.216
Well, it is a pity that
you sustained an injury.

38:41.551 --> 38:44.521
I do hope that it didn't cut too deeply.

38:50.993 --> 38:55.563
Mrs. Strong, I have come to
escort you back to Whitehall.

38:55.597 --> 38:59.133
That is, if you are ready to travel.

38:59.167 --> 39:01.068
I'll gather my things.

39:14.347 --> 39:16.449
( Metal squeaking )

39:16.588 --> 39:21.412
__

39:21.412 --> 39:24.185
Man: <i>"Whereas Major Rogers hath demonstrated</i>

39:24.220 --> 39:27.456
<i>inestimable valor in
service to His Majesty...</i>

39:29.392 --> 39:32.193

himself a steadfast servant,

39:32.227 --> 39:35.265

- and whereas he... "
- Just get on with it.

39:40.908 --> 39:43.709
Your king is waiting.

39:45.279 --> 39:48.547
Northwest passage ain't
gonna discover itself.

39:48.582 --> 39:50.348
As you wish.

40:00.729 --> 40:03.165
Your mission must remain a secret.

40:07.701 --> 40:09.770
You may collect your reward.

40:10.840 --> 40:12.872
Right through there.

40:25.051 --> 40:28.288
How about you get it for me?

40:28.322 --> 40:29.656
Hmm?

40:31.993 --> 40:33.992
Very well.

40:38.128 --> 40:41.031
<i>- ( Screaming ) It's me!

41:01.626 --> 41:04.492
- ( blows landing )

41:06.197 --> 41:07.932
<i>( punching, grunting continue )</i>

41:07.967 --> 41:10.437
<i>- ( thuds )

41:10.472 --> 41:12.136
<i>( dragging )</i>

41:13.537 --> 41:14.870

41:20.774 --> 41:24.073
Who is the coward behind this?

41:24.107 --> 41:26.843
Was it André?

41:26.877 --> 41:31.047
You wouldn't dare hatch this on your own,

41:31.081 --> 41:33.215
you pissant!

41:33.249 --> 41:35.485
On whose orders?

41:36.454 --> 41:38.856
The...

41:38.891 --> 41:40.996
