WEBVTT

00:03.090 --> 00:04.047
The vet called.

00:04.091 --> 00:06.136
Stella's test results
came back.

00:06.180 --> 00:09.139
He wants me to
bring her in...today.

00:09.183 --> 00:11.707
Oh, no.
Come here, you.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.274
Oh, Jay,
I'm so sorry.

00:13.317 --> 00:17.278
That is the bad thing
about loving animals, right?

00:17.321 --> 00:21.108
But think about all the
wonderful things you gave her,

00:21.151 --> 00:24.111
like a beautiful home,
delicious food...

00:24.154 --> 00:26.983
...our marital bed.

00:27.027 --> 00:31.205
Ay, Stella will not
be forgotten.

00:32.249 --> 00:34.860
I'm not putting her down,
you goblin.

00:34.904 --> 00:36.210
She needs a surgery.

00:36.253 --> 00:39.430
Oh. That is
such great news.

00:39.474 --> 00:41.084
Oh, what's wrong
with Stella?

00:41.128 --> 00:43.086
She has an elongated
soft palate,

00:43.130 --> 00:45.306
which is why sometimes
it's hard for her to breathe.

00:45.349 --> 00:46.872
And she snores a lot.

00:46.916 --> 00:48.439
Any chance that
they can do you, too?

00:48.483 --> 00:50.876
This is a serious operation.
They have to put her out.

00:50.920 --> 00:52.661
What happens
if she doesn't wake up?

00:52.704 --> 00:53.879
What would I do?!

00:53.923 --> 00:55.316
When I got
my wisdom teeth out,

00:55.359 --> 00:57.318
you made me walk the last
four blocks to the dentist

00:57.361 --> 00:59.885
so you could get an Egg McMuffin
before the 10:30 cut-off.

00:59.929 --> 01:01.148
You're gonna
have to let that go.

01:01.191 --> 01:02.801
You know what?
I'm not gonna do it.

01:02.845 --> 01:04.803
She seems fine.Maybe she just needs

01:04.847 --> 01:06.153
some fresh air
to breathe better.

01:06.196 --> 01:08.111
Why don't we take her
to the dog park?

01:08.155 --> 01:11.114
That's a great idea. Might be
a little muddy out there.

01:11.158 --> 01:12.681
I'm gonna get your boots,
gorgeous.

01:12.724 --> 01:14.465
Thank you.

01:14.509 --> 01:17.903
My boots are in the closet,
next to the --

01:17.947 --> 01:19.470
Was he just talking
to Stella?

01:19.514 --> 01:20.906
Come here, you.

01:34.920 --> 01:37.140
Crown molding wainscoting,
crown molding wainscoting,

01:37.184 --> 01:39.273
French door credit score,
French door credit score.

01:39.316 --> 01:40.709
You warming up
for a big showing?

01:40.752 --> 01:41.753
Very big.

01:41.797 --> 01:43.581
I finally found Pepper
his dream house.

01:43.625 --> 01:44.582
I can't believe you're still

01:44.626 --> 01:45.714
letting that man
waste your time.

01:45.757 --> 01:47.281
How many houses
have you shown him?

01:47.324 --> 01:50.719
Pfft, only, like --
I don't know, like, uh, 120.

01:50.762 --> 01:52.286
But we have fun.
He's a hoot.

01:52.329 --> 01:54.940
Honey, even Mitch and Cam agree
that he's impossible,

01:54.984 --> 01:56.420
and he's never gonna
buy a house.

01:56.464 --> 01:57.552
Yes, he will.
No.

01:57.595 --> 01:59.380
He always manages
to find something wrong.

01:59.423 --> 02:03.558
The last house, the yoga room
was too close to the panic room.

02:03.601 --> 02:05.212
He was willing
to live with that,

02:05.255 --> 02:07.779
but the property
wasn't zoned for his falcons.

02:07.823 --> 02:10.347
This one today, though,
checks every single box.

02:10.391 --> 02:13.785
Great. So if Pepper doesn't
buy the house today,

02:13.829 --> 02:16.353
you agree to stop letting
him string you along

02:16.397 --> 02:18.442
and drop him as a client.

02:18.486 --> 02:21.880
How long did you string me along
before I closed that deal?

02:21.924 --> 02:24.100
Honey, you can't
get Pepper pregnant

02:24.144 --> 02:26.015
and trap him in a house.You're on.

02:26.058 --> 02:27.016
You remember
you need to be home

02:27.059 --> 02:28.800
by 5:00, right?
Yeah.

02:28.844 --> 02:30.193
Wait, why?

02:30.237 --> 02:32.369
Alex's boyfriend, Bill,
has cooked up some invention

02:32.413 --> 02:34.241
he wants us to invest in.

02:34.284 --> 02:35.590
Why us?

02:35.633 --> 02:39.594
Because someone
inspired him.

02:39.637 --> 02:41.813
As you can see,
my patent-pending

02:41.857 --> 02:45.469
Wear-Chair TM,
barely noticeable.

02:45.513 --> 02:47.471
I love it.
Whenever I get
tired of standing,

02:47.515 --> 02:49.821
all I have to do --
press this button.

02:49.865 --> 02:54.348
A spring-loaded leg jets out to
provide me with a comfy seat.

02:55.392 --> 02:57.829
You put it on backwards,
didn't you?

02:57.873 --> 02:59.396
My point is, Bill,

02:59.440 --> 03:01.790
there's a great invention
inside all of us.

03:01.833 --> 03:03.618
Please,
just be home in time.

03:03.661 --> 03:05.489
I don't want to crush
a man's dreams on my own.

03:05.533 --> 03:06.229
You have to do it with me.

03:06.273 --> 03:08.797
Who knows? We might love
his invention.

03:08.840 --> 03:09.928
It's gonna be stupid.

03:09.972 --> 03:11.278
Good thing you weren't
married to George Foreman

03:11.321 --> 03:13.410
or we'd still be grilling
our meats one side at a time.

03:13.454 --> 03:14.890
Mm.

03:14.933 --> 03:19.460
So, Lily, how --
how are you today?!

03:19.503 --> 03:20.809
Lily?!

03:20.852 --> 03:22.376
Lily.

03:22.419 --> 03:24.465
Your father was just asking
how you're doing.

03:24.508 --> 03:25.596
Are --
Are you all right?

03:25.640 --> 03:26.902
I'm fine.
Okay.

03:28.295 --> 03:30.688
Yeah.

03:30.732 --> 03:32.690
Okay, uh...
I gestured you over here

03:32.734 --> 03:34.257
'cause we need to
talk about Lily.

03:34.301 --> 03:35.476
Yes, I puzzled that out.

03:35.519 --> 03:37.260
Also, you don't need to whisper.
Watch.

03:37.304 --> 03:39.175
Honey, your father and I
may get divorced

03:39.219 --> 03:40.959
because he's thinking
about becoming a woman.

03:41.003 --> 03:42.657
That explains a lot.

03:42.700 --> 03:46.704
I'm in between songs.Okay, all right.
Now out. This way.

03:46.748 --> 03:48.097
What is going on
with her?

03:48.140 --> 03:50.099
I don't want to be shut out
like this another day.

03:50.142 --> 03:52.275
I know, but let's --
let's not get hysterical.

03:52.319 --> 03:53.537
I'm not getting
hysterical.

03:53.581 --> 03:54.973
We're minutes away.Fair enough.

03:55.017 --> 03:56.758
I just want to see
her smile.

03:56.801 --> 03:58.542
Yeah, okay, I'm gonna
text Ronaldo again.

03:58.586 --> 04:01.458
Hopefully he got us into
that KimmyLoveandStuff party.

04:01.502 --> 04:03.765
KimmyLoveandStuff
is an Internet sensation

04:03.808 --> 04:05.375
that Lily loves.
Yeah.

04:05.419 --> 04:06.942
Boom!She tries on clothes,

04:06.985 --> 04:09.510
she cries about bullies
and plastic.

04:09.553 --> 04:11.512
You guys, just imagine

04:11.555 --> 04:13.862
if you were a turtle
and this happened to you.

04:13.905 --> 04:15.864
Our whole family
is obsessed with her.

04:15.907 --> 04:18.301
And that's the great thing
about a tween girl

04:18.345 --> 04:19.433
having two gay dads.

04:19.476 --> 04:21.565
I mean, we --
we love the same things.

04:21.609 --> 04:23.567
Cute guys,
fashion, gossip.

04:23.611 --> 04:26.091
Oh, my God!
Ronaldo, he got us in!

04:26.135 --> 04:27.179
Amazing.

04:27.223 --> 04:28.311
Okay, we have to get him
a thank-you gift.

04:28.355 --> 04:29.878
No, no, he owes you, okay?

04:29.921 --> 04:31.445
You gave him
your bone marrow.

04:31.488 --> 04:32.794
Well, how could I not?

04:32.837 --> 04:35.710
He was still hungry, and I
wasn't gonna eat any more of it.

04:35.753 --> 04:39.714
And we make our way back
to the formal entryway,

04:39.757 --> 04:41.933
which, according
to your checklist,

04:41.977 --> 04:44.153
"must be large enough
to make people swoon

04:44.196 --> 04:45.328
when they step inside."

04:45.372 --> 04:47.678
I want to do it again.

04:47.722 --> 04:50.464
Ugh, that Pepper claims
to be wealthy,

04:50.507 --> 04:51.682
but I don't believe it
for a --

04:51.726 --> 04:53.118
Oh, my heavens!

04:53.162 --> 04:54.337
We're peasants.

04:54.381 --> 04:56.426
It's got everything
on your list --

04:56.470 --> 04:58.994
piano bar,
his and his dining rooms,

04:59.037 --> 05:02.476
plus a view of Rihanna's roof,
which I never quite understood.

05:02.519 --> 05:04.521
I did a party for her once,
and I could feel

05:04.565 --> 05:07.959
those judgy Barbadian eyes
looking down on me.

05:08.003 --> 05:11.485
Now who's looking down
on who, RiRi?

05:11.528 --> 05:14.357
Like they say, location,
location, vengeance.

05:14.401 --> 05:16.577
You're funny.

05:16.620 --> 05:19.493
Oh, it's fabulous, Phil.
Mother would love it.

05:19.536 --> 05:21.582
It's her generosity
and my power of attorney

05:21.625 --> 05:23.584
that are making
this purchase possible.

05:23.627 --> 05:26.587
So...are we ready
to sign the offer?

05:26.630 --> 05:28.284
Very close.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.851
I just want to live
in it for a bit,

05:29.894 --> 05:31.505
get a feel
for the everyday.

05:31.548 --> 05:32.636
You're in no hurry,
right?

05:32.680 --> 05:34.072
Oh, no, no, no.
If I was in a hurry,

05:34.116 --> 05:36.597
would I have shown you
over 200 houses?

05:36.640 --> 05:38.729
I can't wait
to get to the park.

05:38.773 --> 05:40.165
Hey, there's our mailman.

05:40.209 --> 05:41.515
Hey! Hey!

05:41.558 --> 05:42.733
Settle down, Jay.

05:42.777 --> 05:44.169
Boy, I'm itchy today.

05:44.213 --> 05:46.171
Hey, I hope that dog
Bingo's at the park.

05:46.215 --> 05:47.521
He's fun to play with.

05:47.564 --> 05:49.479
What are you doing?
You just missed our turn.

05:49.523 --> 05:50.828
I'm just
going another way.

05:50.872 --> 05:53.309
There is no other way.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.442
You're not taking us
to the park.

05:55.485 --> 05:56.791
We're going to the vet.

05:56.834 --> 05:59.663
The doctor said
that she needs this surgery.

05:59.707 --> 06:02.013
She's gonna be fine.I feel sick. I need some air.

06:06.670 --> 06:09.543
So, here I am on an ordinary day
in my new house

06:09.586 --> 06:13.198
everyone hates me for and
I'm walking and I'm kvelling...

06:13.242 --> 06:17.507
And we're panting
and we're schvitzing...

06:17.551 --> 06:21.424
And we're laughing
and we're crying...

06:21.468 --> 06:23.295
And we're thinking.

06:23.339 --> 06:24.906
And I'm putting.

06:24.949 --> 06:26.342
So,
you have an entire wardrobe

06:26.386 --> 06:27.691
in your car?
Shh!

06:27.735 --> 06:31.913
♪ And I'm playing
and I'm singing ♪

06:31.956 --> 06:33.480
♪ And they're loving it

06:34.742 --> 06:36.570
I said loving it.

06:38.572 --> 06:41.531
This is a disaster!

06:41.575 --> 06:43.228
What a fun way
to enter a room.

06:43.272 --> 06:45.230
I know Bill's coming over
to talk to you guys today,

06:45.274 --> 06:47.232
and I'm freaking out.Oh, honey, don't worry.

06:47.276 --> 06:48.843
We're not gonna invest
in his invention.

06:48.886 --> 06:50.497
That's not why
he wants to talk to you.

06:50.540 --> 06:51.585
It's a cover.

06:51.628 --> 06:54.239
He's going to ask
for your blessing to marry me.

06:54.283 --> 06:56.459
Whoa, what?And you have to tell him no.

06:56.503 --> 06:57.939
How do you know this?

06:57.982 --> 07:00.594
All of the men in his family
propose on Valentine's Day,

07:00.637 --> 07:01.508
which is coming up.

07:01.551 --> 07:03.248
I read a text he sent
to his buddy

07:03.292 --> 07:05.033
who just got engaged
asking for tips

07:05.076 --> 07:06.817
for a good proposal,
and my friend saw him

07:06.861 --> 07:08.602
coming out of
a jewelry store.

07:08.645 --> 07:11.605
So you read his texts
and you track his movements.

07:11.648 --> 07:13.607
I can see why he's so eager
to lock you down.

07:13.650 --> 07:16.174
Look, I really like
being with Bill,

07:16.218 --> 07:17.959
and if I have to
turn him down,

07:18.002 --> 07:20.614
that means the end of
the relationship

07:20.657 --> 07:23.399
and all that great sex.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.662
Really come out of your shell,
haven't you?

07:27.882 --> 07:30.058
-Okay.

07:30.101 --> 07:33.888
Okay. Are you ready?!
Surprise!

07:33.931 --> 07:36.325
I'm gonna need a little bit
more information.

07:36.368 --> 07:40.329
You are at KimmyLoveandStuff's
exclusive launch party...KimmyLoveandStuff.

07:40.372 --> 07:43.680
...for her new makeup line,
and she's gonna sing

07:43.724 --> 07:44.899
her hit single...Single!

07:44.942 --> 07:46.509
..."Give Me Love and Stuff.""Love and Stuff."

07:46.553 --> 07:49.164
Okay.
How did you guys do this?

07:49.207 --> 07:52.733
Hello, total strangers.
Welcome.

07:52.776 --> 07:54.343
Thank you so much
for doing this, Ronaldo.

07:54.386 --> 07:55.779
If anyone
asks who you are,

07:55.823 --> 07:57.694
say you were looking for
the Garth Brooks book signing.

07:57.738 --> 07:59.609
Oh.They'll believe you
because of your clothes.

07:59.653 --> 08:01.611
I'm gonna go look
for the bathroom.

08:01.655 --> 08:04.658
Okay.Oh, look, she is so nervous,
it's adorable.

08:04.701 --> 08:06.660
Um, uh, do you think
that there's any way

08:06.703 --> 08:09.184
we can get KimmyLoveandStuff
to come over and meet Lily?

08:09.227 --> 08:11.403
I'm not allowed to look her
in the eye, so no.

08:11.447 --> 08:13.754
This is Ronaldo.

08:13.797 --> 08:16.626
Just pick it up, blow on it,
and put it back on the tray.

08:16.670 --> 08:18.236
Are you kidding me
with these questions?

08:18.280 --> 08:19.977
We got to get KimmyLoveandStuff

08:20.021 --> 08:23.415
to say hi to Lily.Well, there's
her dog, Boo, so she's nearby.

08:23.459 --> 08:25.548
Okay, I just got a really
sketchy but great idea.

08:25.592 --> 08:28.420
Um, did you pack
your jerky?

08:28.464 --> 08:29.639
Turkey, beef, or salmon?

08:29.683 --> 08:30.988
Here's what we're gonna do.Oh, please.

08:31.032 --> 08:32.555
This is not the first time
I've lured an animal

08:32.599 --> 08:34.992
away from its owner
with my purse jerky.

08:36.820 --> 08:39.606
Boo, come here.
Boo, you want some food?

08:39.649 --> 08:41.042
Good girl. Come here.

08:41.085 --> 08:43.261
Move! Boo!

08:43.305 --> 08:45.263
Does anyone have eyes
on Boo?!

08:45.307 --> 08:47.048
Those old men
snatched her.

08:47.091 --> 08:48.702
Are you trying to
steal my dog?

08:48.745 --> 08:50.051
No, no, no, no. I'm so sorry.
We were just --

08:50.094 --> 08:51.705
We're just trying to,
uh, get your attention.

08:51.748 --> 08:53.271
Yeah, you see, our daughter,
Lily, she --

08:53.315 --> 08:54.708
she's a massive fan

08:54.751 --> 08:57.058
and she's a little depressed
right now and we just --

08:57.101 --> 08:58.842
we want to see
her smile again.

08:58.886 --> 09:01.410
Oh...my...God.

09:02.977 --> 09:04.935
Gay dads are the best!

09:04.979 --> 09:07.372
That's what we said.We say that.

09:07.416 --> 09:08.939
I think it's because
we love to have fun,

09:08.983 --> 09:10.811
but we're also
not afraid to get real.

09:10.854 --> 09:13.857
Aww. I hate the idea
of your daughter not smiling.

09:13.901 --> 09:15.598
Let's go make her day.

09:15.642 --> 09:17.034
Okay, well,
that's her right there.

09:17.078 --> 09:18.645
Um, that's Lily.

09:18.688 --> 09:19.646
Film this.

09:19.689 --> 09:20.821
I-Is she talking to me?

09:20.864 --> 09:21.822
Yeah.

09:21.865 --> 09:24.738
Of course, Ms. LoveandStuff.

09:24.781 --> 09:27.610
Hey, lovers and stuffers.
It's your girl, Kimmy.

09:27.654 --> 09:28.959
We're here at my launch party

09:29.003 --> 09:32.833
where I'm about to surprise
my biggest fan.

09:32.876 --> 09:35.444
You ready to see someone's mind
kim-plode?

09:37.881 --> 09:40.971
Hey, Lily.
You having fun and stuff?

09:41.015 --> 09:42.799
Hey.

09:42.843 --> 09:44.279
Lily,
it's KimmyLoveandStuff.

09:44.322 --> 09:45.454
I know. I said "hey."

09:45.497 --> 09:46.890
You know what?
I think she's in shock.

09:46.934 --> 09:48.675
Lily, why don't you tell her
your favorite video.

09:48.718 --> 09:50.677
Mine was when you tackled racism

09:50.720 --> 09:52.679
and gave yourself that cute
fishtail braid.

09:52.722 --> 09:53.854
Uh-huh. And Lily.

09:53.897 --> 09:56.291
I don't watch them anymore.
Sorry. Can we go?

09:56.334 --> 09:57.858
Cut! Give me that!

09:57.901 --> 09:59.642
Lily? You're --
You're being very rude.

09:59.686 --> 10:01.426
Extra rude!

10:01.470 --> 10:03.777
And who are you people
and how did you get in here?

10:03.820 --> 10:06.693
Both: Garth Brooks.When I find out,
heads will roll.

10:06.736 --> 10:09.565
I'm so embarrassed.Both: You'reso embarrassed?

10:09.609 --> 10:12.002
You're so embarrassed?

10:13.047 --> 10:14.875
Okay.
We're ready for Stella.

10:14.918 --> 10:16.354
Well, I'm not ready.

10:16.398 --> 10:18.443
Jay, come on.Ah.

10:18.487 --> 10:21.055
All right. Careful.

10:22.709 --> 10:26.016
Wait a second.
I-I have to say something.

10:26.060 --> 10:28.671
Little girl,
I know you're scared.

10:28.715 --> 10:30.847
Me too.
But you're a fighter.

10:30.891 --> 10:33.807
"Don't worry, Daddy.
I'll be fine."

10:33.850 --> 10:34.938
She doesn't
sound like that.

10:34.982 --> 10:37.724
Sorry.
She'll do great.

10:37.767 --> 10:40.814
What is going on with you?
I've never seen you like this.

10:40.857 --> 10:41.858
I don't know.

10:41.902 --> 10:45.079
When I was 10,
Dad came home with a rescue,

10:45.122 --> 10:47.298
and I was
so damned excited.

10:47.342 --> 10:49.083
But the dog wanted nothing
to do with me --

10:49.126 --> 10:52.564
went straight to my sister
and never left her side.

10:52.608 --> 10:56.307
Then years later, we got
a puppy who went right to Dede,

10:56.351 --> 10:58.135
growled at me every time
I went near her.

10:58.179 --> 11:03.140
But with Stella, I didn't even
bother trying, and she chose me.

11:03.184 --> 11:06.274
Now I may never
see her again.

11:06.317 --> 11:09.581
I-I-I can't sit here.
I need to take a walk.

11:11.409 --> 11:13.368
What kind of surgery?

11:13.411 --> 11:15.370
They just have to
fix her breathing.

11:15.413 --> 11:16.719
It's not a big deal.

11:16.763 --> 11:18.721
Hmm.
Is that what they told you?

11:18.765 --> 11:20.592
I'd be careful
if I were you.

11:20.636 --> 11:21.768
What do you mean?

11:21.811 --> 11:24.553
Men get crazy
about their animals.

11:24.596 --> 11:28.383
My husband had this horrible cat
with a big lump on its neck.

11:28.426 --> 11:31.168
It was benign,
didn't bother my husband,

11:31.212 --> 11:32.953
but I couldn't stand
looking at it.

11:32.996 --> 11:35.172
So one day,
when my husband was at work,

11:35.216 --> 11:37.609
I brought the cat in here
to have them take

11:37.653 --> 11:39.611
that thing off and --
Kchhh.

11:39.655 --> 11:41.875
It died
right on the table.

11:41.918 --> 11:44.094
Ay, no.
Was your husband mad?

11:44.138 --> 11:46.793
Ex-husband, so yeah.

11:46.836 --> 11:50.231
Ay...Damn it.

11:50.274 --> 11:51.841
Hola.

11:51.885 --> 11:53.408
Hello?

11:56.237 --> 11:59.893
Well, all righty.
I thought I was next.

11:59.936 --> 12:03.810
Well, that's the first time I've
slow-cooked ribs for a showing.

12:03.853 --> 12:04.898
Mother's recipe.

12:04.941 --> 12:07.596
So, are you ready
to make an offer?

12:09.424 --> 12:10.817
I don't know, Phil.

12:10.860 --> 12:11.992
Don't know what, Pep?

12:13.036 --> 12:14.559
I'm just not feeling it.Oh.

12:14.603 --> 12:17.562
Maybe we should see
some more houses?No problemo.

12:17.606 --> 12:19.347
Um, did you want to look
in another neighborhood

12:19.390 --> 12:22.045
or stay right here
in Hell?!

12:22.089 --> 12:24.831
Aah! Oh!
I beg your --

12:24.874 --> 12:28.617
No, I beg. For God's sakes,
buy this house.

12:28.660 --> 12:31.794
I've worked harder for you than
any client in my entire career.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.796
I don't know
if you're indecisive,

12:33.840 --> 12:35.842
sadistic,
or just plain crazy.

12:35.885 --> 12:36.843
Hey there, honey.

12:36.886 --> 12:37.844
You're still there,
aren't you?

12:37.887 --> 12:40.063
He's just dotting the I's,
crossing the T's.

12:40.107 --> 12:42.936
Yanking your chain.
Dump him.

12:42.979 --> 12:44.285
Listen, Bill's about to
be here any minute,

12:44.328 --> 12:46.417
and the situation
has changed.

12:47.462 --> 12:48.419
Got to go.

12:49.943 --> 12:53.076
Get back here! I found you
a bathroom with a koi pond!

12:57.515 --> 13:00.083
I have Stella! Get in!

13:04.087 --> 13:05.654
Where is she?

13:05.697 --> 13:07.656
She's in the back.Is she okay?

13:07.699 --> 13:10.093
I busted her out.
I can't make you do this.

13:10.137 --> 13:11.007
If something happens to her,

13:11.051 --> 13:12.617
you're never going to
forgive me,

13:12.661 --> 13:14.228
and I don't want to lose you
like that.

13:14.271 --> 13:16.883
Well, that's touching, but you
just blew through a stop sign.

13:16.926 --> 13:19.189
She'd probably
be safer at the vet.

13:20.451 --> 13:22.932
Ronaldo.
It's Phil Dunphy.

13:22.976 --> 13:23.846
Hello, Phil.

13:23.890 --> 13:25.848
I'm preparing
a plate for a diva.

13:25.892 --> 13:27.241
Is everything okay?

13:27.284 --> 13:28.895
Uh, actually, no.

13:28.938 --> 13:30.679
I lost my temper with Pepper
when he told me

13:30.722 --> 13:32.246
he wanted to see more houses,
and I've been calling

13:32.289 --> 13:34.422
to apologize, but...He's not picking up.

13:34.465 --> 13:35.510
How did you know?

13:35.553 --> 13:36.728
It seemed the only
possible conclusion

13:36.772 --> 13:38.121
to your sentence.Oh.

13:38.165 --> 13:39.775
Phil,
do you know the reason

13:39.819 --> 13:41.429
I stopped house hunting
with Pepper?

13:41.472 --> 13:43.648
Was it when that seller
thought Pepper was your grandpa?

13:43.692 --> 13:45.650
He hasn't let me wear
sunscreen since.

13:45.694 --> 13:48.871
No. I finally realized
he wasn't going to buy a house.

13:48.915 --> 13:51.743
Are you kidding?
I've wasted hundreds of hours.

13:51.787 --> 13:54.790
I postponed hernia surgery.
Why would he do that to me?

13:54.834 --> 13:56.357
He likes you.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.924
Most straight guys
find Pepper annoying,

13:57.967 --> 14:00.013
but you're always
so nice with him.

14:00.056 --> 14:01.579
I think he's afraid
if he buys a house,

14:01.623 --> 14:03.799
he'll never see you again.Really?

14:03.843 --> 14:06.106
Wow, it's so painful keeping
everything inside.

14:06.149 --> 14:07.237
It's how he was raised.

14:07.281 --> 14:08.673
No,
my truss isn't working.

14:08.717 --> 14:10.110
I've got to schedule
that procedure.

14:10.153 --> 14:11.502
Do you know
where Pepper is?

14:11.546 --> 14:13.940
He has a special place
he goes when he's sad.

14:13.983 --> 14:15.115
It's pretty gay.

14:15.158 --> 14:17.117
Have you ever seen
the movie "La La Land"?

14:17.160 --> 14:18.683
Of course. Wait,
does he go to the bench

14:18.727 --> 14:20.685
overlooking the city where
Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone

14:20.729 --> 14:21.904
tap danced into
each other's hearts?

14:21.948 --> 14:24.472
That's not so gay.
Okay.

14:24.515 --> 14:26.039
No, no, no, no, no, no.

14:26.082 --> 14:28.128
Take those things off,
please.

14:28.171 --> 14:31.044
We need to talk about whatever's
going on with you right now.

14:31.087 --> 14:33.524
I'm fine.No, you're not fine.

14:33.568 --> 14:35.091
You're sullen
and aloof and --

14:35.135 --> 14:37.528
and you embarrassed us in front
of KimmyLoveandStu--

14:37.572 --> 14:38.790
I can't say it again.
I can't.

14:38.834 --> 14:41.924
Okay, we gave you
every tween girl's dream day,

14:41.968 --> 14:44.492
and -- and you can
barely crack a smile.

14:44.535 --> 14:47.103
It's not mydream day.
It's yours.

14:47.147 --> 14:49.801
I'm not the same kind
of tween girl you guys are.

14:49.845 --> 14:51.934
But we love
all the same things.

14:51.978 --> 14:53.936
I've changed.
I don't like Beyoncé.

14:53.980 --> 14:55.503
You take that back!

14:55.546 --> 14:56.591
Or Britney.

14:56.634 --> 14:58.158
Or Gaga.

14:58.201 --> 15:00.943
I only fake it 'cause
you guys like that stuff.

15:00.987 --> 15:02.510
I'm different.

15:02.553 --> 15:04.338
Well, honey, is it --

15:04.381 --> 15:06.340
is that why you've been feeling
so down, because you --

15:06.383 --> 15:08.037
you feel different than us?

15:08.081 --> 15:10.953
I don't know. I guess I feel
different than a lot of people.

15:10.997 --> 15:13.303
Well, sweetie,
that is one thing

15:13.347 --> 15:15.044
your dad and I
can relate to.

15:15.088 --> 15:18.004
I guess, well, that's the great
thing about having two gay dads.

15:18.047 --> 15:20.658
We -- We know what it feels
like to be an outsider.

15:20.702 --> 15:22.095
Okay,
but here's what happens.

15:22.138 --> 15:25.098
You start finding people
who don't quite fit in,

15:25.141 --> 15:27.970
and you start not
fitting in together.

15:28.014 --> 15:29.232
We never want you
to feel like

15:29.276 --> 15:31.104
you have to be
someone else for us.

15:31.147 --> 15:32.888
Never.
I mean --

15:32.932 --> 15:35.108
What is this music
you're always listening to?

15:35.151 --> 15:35.978
Come on. Let us in.
Yeah.

15:36.022 --> 15:37.849
Okay. I like this.

15:37.893 --> 15:38.981
Okay.
Let's put it on, huh?

15:39.025 --> 15:40.852
All right. Here we go.

15:40.896 --> 15:45.988
♪ Where's your sanity?♪

15:46.032 --> 15:46.989
Fun!
Yeah.

15:47.033 --> 15:49.209
Yeah, yeah, I like it.

15:49.252 --> 15:51.515
She's gonna kill us someday.Mm-hmm.

15:53.169 --> 15:55.345
Hey. I just want to say,
I really appreciate you

15:55.389 --> 15:57.695
wanting to save Stella
like that.

15:57.739 --> 15:59.915
Well, Stella is not
the only one that choose you.

15:59.959 --> 16:03.875
I choose you every day, and I
love her more than I show.

16:05.094 --> 16:07.053
Okay, sweetheart.
Let's get you inside.

16:07.096 --> 16:09.185
I'll throw on a couple of steaks
for both of us.

16:11.318 --> 16:12.058
What the hell
dog is this?

16:12.101 --> 16:14.451
It's Stella.
No, it's not.

16:14.495 --> 16:16.932
Eight years,
you don't recognize our dog?

16:16.976 --> 16:19.717
Well, 10 years, and you don't
notice one haircut?

16:21.284 --> 16:24.157
By the time we got through to
the vet, the surgery was over.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.636
And Stella was fine.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.638
I just have to say Gloria
really stepped up

16:27.682 --> 16:29.640
and nursed my baby
back to health.

16:29.684 --> 16:31.860
Only one problem.

16:31.903 --> 16:33.427
Stella choose me now.

16:33.470 --> 16:35.646
It's not real.
You give her pain meds.

16:35.690 --> 16:38.214
It's like she's sucking up
to her dealer.

16:38.258 --> 16:40.129
Hi, Bill.

16:40.173 --> 16:41.043
Hey.
Come on in.

16:41.087 --> 16:43.654
Thanks. Is, uh,
Mr. Dunphy around, too?

16:43.698 --> 16:46.092
Uh, no, he's probably
on his way back,

16:46.135 --> 16:47.658
and we should definitely
wait for him.

16:47.702 --> 16:49.443
Oh. I actually have to
get to work pretty soon.

16:49.486 --> 16:51.314
Do you think maybe you could
just speak for the both of you?

16:51.358 --> 16:54.317
Nope.
Phil is very opinionated.

16:54.361 --> 16:57.320
And strict.
"What I say goes around here."

16:57.364 --> 16:59.192
He's a very scary
customer.

16:59.235 --> 17:01.629
Okay. I don't really
have a choice here.

17:01.672 --> 17:04.936
Mm-hmm.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.938
Mr. and Mrs. Dunphy...

17:06.982 --> 17:09.941
would you be willing to take
a chance on a guy like me

17:09.985 --> 17:12.292
and let me --Alex is too young
to get married.

17:12.335 --> 17:14.729
I'm sorry. Phil,
who is very quick to anger,

17:14.772 --> 17:15.947
would never allow it.

17:15.991 --> 17:18.167
Oh, I wasn't asking
to marry Alex.

17:20.126 --> 17:22.128
What -- What's happening?

17:22.171 --> 17:24.086
And then it got weirder.

17:24.130 --> 17:25.653
Ladies and gentlemen...Hmm?

17:25.696 --> 17:28.221
...I give you
my new invention,

17:28.264 --> 17:32.094
the Pull-Yourself-Up-
By-Your-Bootstraps-TM.

17:32.138 --> 17:33.748
How many times
has this happened to you?

17:33.791 --> 17:35.315
You're in bed, asleep.

17:35.358 --> 17:36.968
All of a sudden...

17:37.012 --> 17:38.318
Oh, no.

17:38.361 --> 17:41.190
It's an earthquake.
No time to get dressed.

17:41.234 --> 17:44.541
I'm gonna have to run out
into the street naked again.

17:44.585 --> 17:46.761
Huh.
Unless...

17:46.804 --> 17:48.197
Oh.

17:52.854 --> 17:54.160
And I'm out the door
in seconds.

17:54.203 --> 17:56.162
Oh, okay.That's it?

17:56.205 --> 17:58.947
You didn't come to ask
for my hand in marriage?

17:58.990 --> 18:00.688
Wh-- Of course not.

18:00.731 --> 18:01.689
What do you mean,
"of course not"?

18:01.732 --> 18:02.907
What are we doing,
Bill?

18:02.951 --> 18:04.126
Honey, take the win.

18:04.170 --> 18:05.736
Okay, first of all,

18:05.780 --> 18:08.174
you're a super smart,
independent woman

18:08.217 --> 18:09.740
with an amazing future
ahead of you.

18:09.784 --> 18:10.959
Why would you want to
get married right now?

18:11.002 --> 18:12.178
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
So, what were you doing

18:12.221 --> 18:13.309
in that jewelry store
yesterday?

18:13.353 --> 18:15.311
I was getting a battery
for my watch.

18:15.355 --> 18:17.922
How did you know
I was in a jewelry store?And what about that text you s--

18:17.966 --> 18:19.359
For what it's worth,

18:19.402 --> 18:21.491
if that's what I thought you
wanted, I would propose today.

18:21.535 --> 18:24.364
Hmm.I'm pretty sure
you're my forever someone.

18:24.407 --> 18:26.409
Really?

18:26.453 --> 18:28.498
Alexandra Dunphy...

18:28.542 --> 18:30.370
would you --
Mom!

18:30.413 --> 18:32.285
Okay, everybody up.
All right.

18:32.328 --> 18:34.200
There we go.
A lot of fires to put out.

18:34.243 --> 18:36.202
Next time,
I'll get to the end.

18:36.245 --> 18:38.378
Next time,
I might be ready.

18:38.421 --> 18:41.903
Ugh. Not a fan
of liberated Alex.

18:43.774 --> 18:45.733
Ugh.

18:49.432 --> 18:51.304
Lovely night.

18:51.347 --> 18:53.175
What are you
doing here?

18:53.219 --> 18:55.395
I called Ronaldo
looking for you.

18:58.789 --> 19:00.748
I come to this place

19:00.791 --> 19:03.968
when life turns out
not to be a musical.

19:04.012 --> 19:05.187
I'm up here a lot.

19:05.231 --> 19:07.189
I'm sorry
I yelled at you.

19:07.233 --> 19:09.278
Well, Phil,
you're not the first person

19:09.322 --> 19:11.280
to find me a tad trying.

19:11.324 --> 19:14.936
This may shock you,
but I don't have many friends.

19:17.852 --> 19:19.810
Express some shock,
Phil.

19:19.854 --> 19:21.812
But you have tons
of friends.

19:21.856 --> 19:23.814
Mitch and Cam love you.

19:23.858 --> 19:27.470
Yeah, they're okay
in small doses.

19:27.514 --> 19:29.820
And a straight-guy friend,
never.

19:29.864 --> 19:32.475
A lot of straight guys
find me...

19:32.519 --> 19:34.260
Annoying?
Intimidating.

19:34.303 --> 19:37.480
Wait for me to finish.
This isn't Mad Libs.

19:37.524 --> 19:39.830
Don't you believe that
I like you, though, Pepper?

19:39.874 --> 19:42.268
I want to,
but maybe I'm just a big,

19:42.311 --> 19:46.097
fat mother's purse
to you.

19:46.141 --> 19:47.882
I'm your friend, Pepper

19:47.925 --> 19:49.231
What are you doing?

19:49.275 --> 19:52.103
This is a yellow suit!

19:52.147 --> 19:53.453
♪ Till the end, Pepper

19:53.496 --> 19:55.455
You're making a scene!

19:55.498 --> 19:57.892
♪ I know that old line

19:57.935 --> 20:02.897
♪ But as soon as I sign,
he'll toss me aside like ♪

20:02.940 --> 20:05.116
♪ Yesterday's wine

20:05.160 --> 20:08.119
♪ My heart's on my sleeve

20:08.163 --> 20:10.905
♪ I want to believe

20:10.948 --> 20:12.689
This is weird.
We're people!

20:12.733 --> 20:13.864
Look.

20:13.908 --> 20:15.518
The only way
you're ever gonna find out

20:15.562 --> 20:17.433
if we're friends
is if you buy that house

20:17.477 --> 20:19.130
and see
if I stick around.

20:19.174 --> 20:22.482
Seems like
an expensive experiment.

20:22.525 --> 20:25.702
Sign the offer...
if you love the house.

20:25.746 --> 20:27.356
Either that or fire me.

20:27.400 --> 20:30.141
It's the only way
you're gonna know.

20:35.886 --> 20:37.497
My heart is in your --I'll see you.

20:37.540 --> 20:39.281
I knew it. Assassin!

20:39.325 --> 20:41.283
I'm messing with you.

20:41.327 --> 20:43.285
That's what I do
with my friends.

20:43.329 --> 20:46.288
Oh. I see. Delightful.

20:46.332 --> 20:48.638
I'm new
at straight chummery.

20:53.556 --> 20:56.994
Stop checking
your watch, Phil.

21:00.563 --> 21:02.739
Oh, no!

21:02.783 --> 21:04.437
It's the big one!

21:04.480 --> 21:06.874
And I'm not dressed!

21:06.917 --> 21:09.311
Grab the earthquake kit!

21:09.355 --> 21:12.662
Everybody, get under a table!

21:12.706 --> 21:16.318
There's cash in the freezer!

21:19.016 --> 21:22.193
Honey, we got to get in on this.

21:22.237 --> 21:24.500
Ah. My high-school boyfriend
could have used that.

21:24.544 --> 21:26.807
You ruined it.
