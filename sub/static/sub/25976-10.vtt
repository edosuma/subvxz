of the Seven Bloods--
where you were.

Why do you care about
Bud Carl so much?


07:47.733 --> 07:49.134

What is that supposed to mean?


07:49.168 --> 07:51.103

I know you helped him
that night.


08:01.713 --> 08:03.882

Hey, if-if you know so much,
why dont you just


08:03.915 --> 08:05.151

take me in right now?


08:05.184 --> 08:06.853

Look, heres what I know
happened.


08:06.886 --> 08:09.555

I know you went there
and I know you loaded bodies


08:09.588 --> 08:11.156

in the back of that truck.


08:11.189 --> 08:13.860

I know you helped Bud Carl
get rid of them.


08:13.893 --> 08:16.928

But I didnt see everything,
and to be honest,


08:16.963 --> 08:19.331

I dont think
you killed anybody.


08:19.365 --> 08:22.300

I think youre a good kid
who got caught up in something.


08:24.103 --> 08:25.937

What do you want me to do?


08:25.971 --> 08:28.173

We go down to the police and you
tell them everything you know,


08:28.206 --> 08:31.610

and we find a way to plea
bargain you to freedom.


08:31.644 --> 08:33.712

What does he have on you


08:33.745 --> 08:35.347

that you aint telling me
everything you know right now?


08:35.380 --> 08:37.283

Cause you got
a lot to lose, buddy.


08:37.316 --> 08:40.086

Whyd you go help
him that night?


08:40.119 --> 08:42.687

I didnt.


08:40.119 --> 08:42.687

You did. You know
you did, but why?


08:42.721 --> 08:44.289

Because your boss calls, okay?


08:44.322 --> 08:46.292

But then you get there,
and see all that


08:46.325 --> 08:47.894

and still go through with it?


08:49.028 --> 08:50.696

Why are you
protecting him?


08:50.730 --> 08:54.066

I dont know
what youre talking about.


09:05.811 --> 09:09.215

You know much about
the foster system?


09:09.248 --> 09:11.650

No, no, I dont.


09:11.683 --> 09:13.251

When youre in the foster
system, your chances


09:13.285 --> 09:15.788

of getting adopted
are around ten to 15%.


09:15.821 --> 09:18.924

Now, Im not gonna pretend your
lifes been easy, Mr. Drimmer.


09:20.091 --> 09:23.328

Im sure it really hasnt.


09:23.361 --> 09:27.767

But I am sure you want
a better one for your daughter.


09:27.799 --> 09:29.100

Now, when you dont have someone


09:29.134 --> 09:31.236

that loves you
to take care of you,


09:31.269 --> 09:34.807

every night, you get the idea
that your mom and dad


09:34.840 --> 09:38.878

didnt care enough
to stop you going to jail,


09:38.911 --> 09:42.981

stop you getting hooked
on drugs.


09:43.014 --> 09:44.850

Or you just start to think
that maybe


09:44.884 --> 09:47.919

they didnt want you
in the first place.


09:47.953 --> 09:51.957

And that feeling
doesnt go away.


09:51.990 --> 09:54.726

It stays with you
your whole life.


10:00.365 --> 10:04.235

Yeah. Yeah, I know that feeling.


10:09.341 --> 10:11.344

was your name? Jake?


10:18.017 --> 10:21.320

Uh-huh.


10:21.354 --> 10:25.256

Uh, y-you have a father
that was around for you, Jake?


10:25.291 --> 10:28.293

Its weird with
dads, you know?


10:28.326 --> 10:31.797

Sometimes they, they come back
into your life.


10:33.798 --> 10:38.971

Uh, mine seems to be getting me
into a lot of trouble right now.


10:40.072 --> 10:42.040

Yeah?


10:42.073 --> 10:44.110

Yeah.


10:44.143 --> 10:48.880

Get in touch when youre ready
to tell me the whole story.


10:48.913 --> 10:52.018

Itll make it
a lot easier on you.


10:52.051 --> 10:53.351

If you dont,


10:53.385 --> 10:56.855

itll be a lot worse.


10:56.889 --> 10:58.923

Are you still furious at me?


10:58.957 --> 11:00.493

No, of course not.


11:00.525 --> 11:03.495

Im sorry I was nasty to you
about the Garrett thing.


11:03.528 --> 11:05.331

I talked to my therapist
about it, and she said


11:05.364 --> 11:07.466

she thought I was quitting
before I was being fired.


11:07.500 --> 11:09.769

What does that mean?


11:09.802 --> 11:12.738

That I was making up an
excuse to be mad at you


11:12.772 --> 11:17.243

because I was worried about us
losing touch when we go away.


11:17.275 --> 11:19.044

We only have a few more weeks
here left.


11:19.077 --> 11:20.913

I really dont want to spend
them being mad at you.


11:20.946 --> 11:22.914

Thank you.


11:22.947 --> 11:24.417

And Im sorry.


11:24.450 --> 11:26.418

You know,
I was, I was a jerk, too.


11:27.820 --> 11:31.823

So have you heard from him?


11:31.856 --> 11:36.294

Yeah, I... yeah, turns out, we
were completely wrong about him,


11:36.327 --> 11:39.130

and the guy
who beat up Carries mom?


11:39.164 --> 11:41.767

Totally different guy.


11:41.801 --> 11:43.969

Oh, my God.

11:46.004 --> 11:47.405

Im sorry.


11:47.440 --> 11:48.941

Honestly, its for
the best, though.


11:48.974 --> 11:50.275

Im not saying that
because of him.


11:50.308 --> 11:52.144

I just mean, like,
were about to leave


11:52.177 --> 11:55.914

and start this whole new
life and hes staying here.


11:55.947 --> 11:57.917

Yeah.


11:57.950 --> 11:59.951

I mean, you are still excited
about leaving, arent you?

22:11.028 --> 22:12.830

for the rest of his life
and more.


22:12.864 --> 22:15.032

Then whats the question?
You need to take this


22:15.067 --> 22:16.902

to Mr. Trask right now, honey.


22:16.934 --> 22:18.836

But if I do,
the mill shuts down.


22:18.869 --> 22:21.038

I spoke to this kid,
Garrett Drimmer.


22:21.073 --> 22:22.907

Young fella, works at the mill.


22:22.941 --> 22:24.875

Hes on that video, too.


22:24.910 --> 22:26.744

Then you turn him in.


22:26.778 --> 22:28.747

Hes got a little
girl, Etta.


22:28.779 --> 22:30.615

So if I take this to Trask,


22:30.648 --> 22:32.150

this young man gets arrested.


22:32.183 --> 22:34.019

What happens to his little girl?


22:34.051 --> 22:35.886

She-she ends up like I did--


22:35.921 --> 22:37.823

coming to a place like this.


22:37.855 --> 22:41.526

Coming to a place like this
is not the end of the world.


22:41.559 --> 22:44.195

When you got a dad
who cares about you, it sure is.


22:44.229 --> 22:45.997

My point is, theres no telling


22:46.030 --> 22:47.999

how many folks
like this Drimmer kid there are,


22:48.032 --> 22:50.801

how many families are ruined
by this place shutting down.


22:50.836 --> 22:55.140

Youre telling me that you know
who murdered seven people,


22:55.173 --> 22:58.743

and youre worried about
a steel mill shutting down?


22:58.777 --> 23:02.446

(scoffs) I dont think
you can do this alone,


23:02.480 --> 23:04.782

and I dont think you
can decide this on your own.


23:04.816 --> 23:06.651

You need
to take this to Peter.


23:06.684 --> 23:07.986

Hmm.


23:08.019 --> 23:09.887

So he gets to bring
it home, right?


23:09.921 --> 23:13.057

So thats whats stopping you,


23:13.090 --> 23:14.859

your vanity.


23:14.893 --> 23:16.528

Nah, it aint that.


23:16.560 --> 23:18.529

Ive had enough of this.


23:18.563 --> 23:20.531

Im going back to bed.


23:20.565 --> 23:23.468

Well, thanks for the insight.


23:25.269 --> 23:27.972

Its not a moral question


23:28.006 --> 23:30.642

if you know
what needs to be done.


23:30.674 --> 23:34.145

The moral question
is whether you do it or not.


23:34.179 --> 23:38.182

Now, let yourself out
and turn out my lights.

38:32.943 --> 38:35.646

Follow me, please.


38:40.851 --> 38:43.454

And, uh, what can I do for you?


38:43.487 --> 38:46.657

Well, I got some information,
so I wanted to come right over.


38:46.690 --> 38:49.492

Ive never had a problem
with you, Mr. Carl.


38:49.527 --> 38:53.530

Youve employed a lot of people
I care about over the years.


38:53.563 --> 38:55.532

Well, thats
good to hear.


38:55.565 --> 38:57.967

Mr. Carl, I have
footage of you,


38:58.001 --> 39:01.005

Rick Mitchell,
Garrett Drimmer.


39:03.907 --> 39:05.876

Hey, Jimmy.


39:05.909 --> 39:08.411

Two coffees.


39:08.445 --> 39:11.782

And I didnt fully know why,
or what you were up to,


39:11.815 --> 39:16.554

but... then I found this.


39:18.456 --> 39:20.958

Now, Ive been thinking
about how to handle this.


39:20.990 --> 39:23.494

After all, Im a detective,
not a cop,


39:23.527 --> 39:26.831

so we can be
a little more creative.


39:26.864 --> 39:29.532

Creative.


39:29.567 --> 39:31.534

What do you want, money?


39:31.568 --> 39:32.869

Listen,


39:32.902 --> 39:35.206

Mr. Carl, this can go
one of two ways:


39:35.239 --> 39:39.610

you can deny all this and I hand
everything over to the cops.


39:39.643 --> 39:43.514

Theyll investigate,
and this will be real hard.


39:43.547 --> 39:45.682

Theyll shut down the
mill in the process.


39:45.715 --> 39:47.918

Or you can walk
into the Braden PD


39:47.952 --> 39:49.652

on your own volition
and confess.


39:49.686 --> 39:51.789

And why would I do that?


39:51.822 --> 39:54.992

Because I think youre
about to lose everything.


39:55.025 --> 39:57.795

They find out about the murder,


39:57.827 --> 40:01.731

they find out about
your involvement, and this...


40:01.766 --> 40:03.233

But we find a way to keep


40:03.266 --> 40:04.934

the deal you made quiet
so the mill can stay open.


40:04.969 --> 40:07.070

You got a green piece of cloth,
and I dont know


40:07.103 --> 40:08.838

what youre talking about...


40:07.103 --> 40:08.838

Dont fuck with
me on this, Bud.


40:08.873 --> 40:11.708

You understand?
You killed a man.


40:11.742 --> 40:14.545

And this harebrained fucking
get-rich-quick scheme of yours


40:14.577 --> 40:16.880

caused six other people to die.


40:18.581 --> 40:20.483

This is bigger than you.


40:20.518 --> 40:22.152

Look around.


40:22.186 --> 40:24.021

Now, Im doing something
Ive never done before,


40:24.054 --> 40:26.791

which is compromise,
but not for you.


40:26.824 --> 40:30.561

But so all these good people
can keep the jobs that you


40:30.594 --> 40:33.731

and your father
and your grandfather


40:33.764 --> 40:35.965

worked all these years
to provide.


40:40.704 --> 40:43.206

Youre from here, right?


40:43.239 --> 40:46.577

Well, then you know.


40:46.610 --> 40:50.614

See, the Carls lived in Braden.


40:50.648 --> 40:52.949

We gave back.


40:52.983 --> 40:55.786

We-we took responsibility.


40:55.820 --> 40:57.755

I went to school
with the workers kids


40:57.788 --> 41:01.157

and the accountants kids,
the foremans kids.


41:01.192 --> 41:04.260

See, a bosss life
was something you could see.


41:04.295 --> 41:06.864

Something to aspire to.


41:06.896 --> 41:10.867

It wasnt some
get-rich-quick scheme.


41:10.900 --> 41:13.003

I dont know
when it changed.


41:14.204 --> 41:16.106

I dont know.


41:16.139 --> 41:18.576

Maybe when it was...


41:18.608 --> 41:22.579

the bosses living further
and further away and...


41:22.612 --> 41:25.782

nobody in these towns seem
like people to them anymore.


41:28.619 --> 41:31.288

But theyve always
been people to me.


41:34.057 --> 41:36.594

Even the ones who died here.


41:36.626 --> 41:40.831

If you care about the
people, turn yourself in,


41:40.864 --> 41:44.702

so your son can be free
and clear,


41:44.735 --> 41:47.070

and take care
of your granddaughter.


41:47.103 --> 41:50.206

You got till 5:00


41:50.240 --> 41:54.811

today to hand yourself in
to the Braden Police,


41:54.844 --> 41:57.882

or I go there
and show them everything.


42:09.860 --> 42:10.994

42:11.027 --> 42:13.030

42:43.293 --> 42:44.628

Oh, it was good.


42:44.661 --> 42:46.697

I think I got it.


42:46.730 --> 42:48.632

(gasps)
Good for you.


42:48.666 --> 42:50.367

42:48.666 --> 42:50.367

Thanks. Dad?


42:50.400 --> 42:52.068

WILSON:

42:52.101 --> 42:53.137

Get the door.


42:53.170 --> 42:54.304

42:54.338 --> 42:57.907

Why do I always have to...?


43:03.414 --> 43:07.717

You. You upgraded.


43:07.751 --> 43:09.286

You got a bigger wagon.


43:09.320 --> 43:11.355

You...


43:09.320 --> 43:11.355

Downgraded.


43:11.387 --> 43:13.190

This is your house?


43:13.222 --> 43:14.724

Dont judge.


43:14.757 --> 43:16.927

So, whats your story?


43:16.960 --> 43:20.431

in the hospital,


43:20.463 --> 43:23.233

and they still cant find Dad.


43:23.266 --> 43:25.101

Oh, thats good, thats good.


43:25.135 --> 43:28.304

But I did get accepted
into the National Science Fair.


43:28.338 --> 43:29.405

When is it?


43:29.440 --> 43:31.275

43:29.440 --> 43:31.275

October. Phoenix, Arizona.


43:31.307 --> 43:32.775

Whats your project?


43:31.307 --> 43:32.775

Desalinating water.


43:32.809 --> 43:34.411

Why?


43:32.809 --> 43:34.411

Global warming.


43:34.445 --> 43:36.947

People in coastal areas during
hurricanes will need clean water


43:36.981 --> 43:39.248

in order to survive,
before help arrives.


43:39.282 --> 43:40.717

How much are your sculptures?


43:40.751 --> 43:43.387

One for seven, two for 12.


43:43.420 --> 43:46.222

Uh-huh. Yeah, thats good.


43:46.255 --> 43:47.925

54:11.880 --> 54:14.351

Want to come in?


54:16.920 --> 54:20.623

Yeah, I was just making,
uh, some, uh, dinner.


54:20.657 --> 54:23.326

Hi, pretty girl.
Whatcha got?


54:23.360 --> 54:24.494

(gasps)


54:24.527 --> 54:26.528

Are you hiding?


54:30.967 --> 54:35.472

I-I thought youd be, like,
um, at college by now.


54:35.505 --> 54:38.842

Yeah, uh...


54:38.875 --> 54:44.447

um... Im not going.


54:44.481 --> 54:47.684

Why?


54:44.481 --> 54:47.684

Funding fell through,


54:47.717 --> 54:51.755

so Im gonna take a year
and work, I guess.


54:51.788 --> 54:53.757

What, do you, like,
need a job or-or, uh...?


54:53.789 --> 54:54.923

(chuckles)


54:54.958 --> 54:56.960

I just, I figured


54:56.992 --> 55:01.498

that since Im not going,


55:01.530 --> 55:04.867

we could... hang out?


55:16.913 --> 55:18.914

(laughs softly)


55:21.483 --> 55:24.788

Um...


55:21.483 --> 55:24.788

(timer dings)


55:24.820 --> 55:28.791

You want to, like, I dont know,
do you want to stay for...


55:28.824 --> 55:30.126

(Carrie babbles)


55:30.159 --> 55:31.827

You want to stay
for dinner, or...?


55:31.860 --> 55:33.963

Yeah. No, dinner sounds great.


55:33.996 --> 55:36.599

Hey, Jake.


55:36.632 --> 55:38.702

JAKE:
Chief Trask.


55:38.735 --> 55:39.869

Thanks for coming down.


55:39.902 --> 55:42.871

Of course.


55:42.905 --> 55:45.875

Congratulations
on getting your man.


55:45.909 --> 55:49.945

Yeah.


55:49.978 --> 55:52.815

I wish we could, uh,
pursue things further,


55:52.849 --> 55:57.420

but whoever Bud was connected
with seems to be a cold trail.


55:57.454 --> 56:01.423

Hmm. All right.


56:01.458 --> 56:03.760

Right.


56:03.793 --> 56:08.465

Well, I have to head home.


56:08.498 --> 56:10.065

Im on baby duty tonight.


56:10.099 --> 56:12.702

(chuckles)


56:10.099 --> 56:12.702

Oh, yeah.


56:12.735 --> 56:15.137

But...


56:15.170 --> 56:18.507

I wanted to say that, uh,


56:18.541 --> 56:21.210

well, if you could ever see
your way clear to joining


56:21.244 --> 56:25.849

this department again,
it would mean a lot to me.


56:25.882 --> 56:29.686

And I did, uh,


56:29.719 --> 56:31.721

did leave some
start paperwork over there


56:31.755 --> 56:35.157

in case you decide to.


56:35.190 --> 56:40.496

And-and if you do
want to come back,


56:40.530 --> 56:43.532

I thought we could take another
run at the Abby Washington case.


56:55.244 --> 56:57.447

(door opens)


57:00.949 --> 57:02.952

(door closes)


57:11.527 --> 57:13.730

57:35.318 --> 57:37.519

(button clicks)


57:44.193 --> 57:46.728

(flap clicks)


57:46.762 --> 57:48.764

(clicking)


57:52.268 --> 57:54.269

(bangs)


58:08.717 --> 58:09.719
