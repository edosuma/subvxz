00:07.215 --> 00:10.125
Oh, damn it. Where are all the spoons?!

00:10.126 --> 00:11.592
Ugh. [Sighs]

00:11.593 --> 00:13.307
Sorry, Brick. This will have to do.

00:13.308 --> 00:14.737
Hey, if you get a chance,

00:14.738 --> 00:16.457
bring some spoons home from the cafeteria.

00:16.458 --> 00:18.456
It's not stealing 'cause we pay taxes.

00:18.457 --> 00:21.603
Okay, I looked everywhere,
and I can't find any towels.

00:21.604 --> 00:23.768
Okay, this is driving me crazy.

00:23.769 --> 00:25.570
I mean, this morning when
I got out of the shower,

00:25.571 --> 00:27.833
I had to dry off with a bath mat.

00:27.834 --> 00:29.738
Nothing is where it's supposed to be.

00:29.739 --> 00:32.345
Is this dementia? Is it finally here?

00:32.345 --> 00:33.975
Where the hell's everything going?

00:34.438 --> 00:36.020
[Axl whistles]

00:36.021 --> 00:37.708
[Utensils clatter]

00:37.709 --> 00:39.548
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. What are you doing?

00:39.549 --> 00:42.644
Unlike you, the government
doesn't just give me stuff.

00:42.645 --> 00:44.436
The government doesn't give us stuff.

00:44.437 --> 00:46.160
If it did, we'd have better stuff.

00:46.161 --> 00:47.249
[Sniffs] Oh! Pbht!

00:47.250 --> 00:49.755
If you people would stop
thinking only about yourselves,

00:49.756 --> 00:52.618
you'd remember, hutch and
I are in our own house now.

00:52.619 --> 00:54.239
And by the way, when they
say a place is unfurnished,

00:54.240 --> 00:55.247
they don't give you anything.

00:55.248 --> 00:58.031
No silverware, no furniture,
no accent pillows, nothing.

00:59.327 --> 01:01.070
Ooh. Eh. I doubt we'll make soup.

01:01.071 --> 01:04.510
Axl, you can't just come in here
and start stealing our stuff.

01:04.512 --> 01:07.086
Uh, last time I checked, there
was five of us in this family,

01:07.087 --> 01:09.691
so, legally, I own 30% of everything.

01:10.857 --> 01:13.086
It's my house, and you're
not taking any of it.

01:13.087 --> 01:14.159
- Put it back.
- [Groans]

01:14.907 --> 01:16.929
You know when you die,
it's all mine anyway, right?

01:16.930 --> 01:18.097
I'm the male heir.

01:18.098 --> 01:20.116
It's just sad you won't
let me have this stuff now

01:20.117 --> 01:21.619
so you can watch me enjoy it.

01:21.620 --> 01:23.600
- Guess what.
- Nobody likes you?

01:23.601 --> 01:25.831
- Can't ruin my day, Axl.
- Ooh, a challenge.

01:25.832 --> 01:28.861
Anyway, thank God I took
the A.C.T.s a second time

01:28.862 --> 01:30.835
because I just heard from Ms. Marsh,

01:30.836 --> 01:32.036
the Guidance Counselor,

01:32.037 --> 01:34.218
that my scores went through the roof!

01:34.219 --> 01:36.275
She actually used the
phrase "through the roof"!

01:36.276 --> 01:37.987
- Oh, way to go, Sue.
- Oh, that's great.

01:37.988 --> 01:39.140
Snore.

01:39.141 --> 01:40.328
Sue: You know what this means, right?

01:40.329 --> 01:42.886
This opens up a whole
new list of possibilities

01:42.887 --> 01:44.502
of where I can go to college.

01:44.503 --> 01:48.727
[Gasps] We're talking Denison,
Michigan, Wheaton, Oberlin.

01:48.728 --> 01:51.850
Yep, my future is wide-open.

01:51.851 --> 01:53.499
[Shrieks shrilly]

01:53.500 --> 01:54.797
- [Groans]
- [Sighs]

01:54.798 --> 01:57.779
- We're screwed.
- We are so screwed.

01:57.780 --> 01:59.521
How are we gonna afford
to send her to college?!

01:59.522 --> 02:01.705
Who told her to take
the A.C.T. a second time?

02:01.706 --> 02:02.753
[Sighs] Was that your idea?

02:02.754 --> 02:05.797
You take your low score,
a-and you live with it.

02:05.798 --> 02:07.971
That's what we did, and we turned out okay.

02:07.972 --> 02:09.756
You know, this is really our fault.

02:09.757 --> 02:12.931
Always encouraging her,
telling her she can do anything.

02:12.932 --> 02:14.574
We just got to be honest with her, Frankie.

02:14.575 --> 02:16.016
She's talking about all these private

02:16.017 --> 02:17.367
and out-of-state schools.

02:17.368 --> 02:19.078
She's go to know that's
probably not going to happen.

02:19.079 --> 02:20.634
Well, we don't know.

02:20.635 --> 02:22.220
[Scoffs] Pretty sure we do.

02:22.221 --> 02:24.619
Well, we don't. I mean, who knows?

02:24.620 --> 02:26.458
Maybe there'll be one of those billionaires

02:26.459 --> 02:27.659
that comes into the class

02:27.660 --> 02:29.339
and offers to pay everyone's college.

02:30.364 --> 02:31.391
Are you drunk?

02:32.276 --> 02:33.987
I might have had a beer.

02:33.988 --> 02:35.298
[Scoffs]

02:35.299 --> 02:36.362
Come on, Mike.

02:36.363 --> 02:37.994
You saw how excited she was...

02:37.995 --> 02:40.274
that little sparkle of hope in her eyes.

02:40.275 --> 02:42.299
Oh. We used to have that.

02:42.300 --> 02:44.113
Hmm. Promise me...

02:44.114 --> 02:46.457
please promise me you won't say anything.

02:46.458 --> 02:48.569
We're not dashing her dreams right now.

02:48.570 --> 02:51.536
Right now we are gonna do
everything we can possibly do

02:51.537 --> 02:52.913
to get her into college.

02:52.914 --> 02:55.696
And we can keep dream dashing in our pocket

02:55.697 --> 02:56.793
as a solid plan "B".

02:57.653 --> 02:59.979
I guess I can always try
to pick up some extra work

02:59.980 --> 03:01.064
at Little Betty.

03:01.065 --> 03:02.976
Yeah, no, I'll find something, too.

03:02.977 --> 03:05.024
It's not all bad

03:05.025 --> 03:07.879
'cause when you come home,
you'll smell like cake.

03:07.880 --> 03:09.423
[Chuckles lightly]

03:09.424 --> 03:12.696
[Sighs]

03:14.185 --> 03:16.399
A shower chair!

03:16.400 --> 03:17.824
Dude, this is so cool.

03:17.825 --> 03:20.055
We've been standing up
like idiots for years.

03:20.056 --> 03:21.320
Definitely take.

03:21.321 --> 03:22.912
Ho-ho! Whoa!

03:23.523 --> 03:25.227
Check out this fondue set.

03:25.228 --> 03:26.776
We can have fondue night.

03:26.777 --> 03:29.152
I thought mom said you couldn't
take any more of our stuff.

03:29.153 --> 03:31.016
Mom said I could take
anything I want down here...

03:31.017 --> 03:33.225
including you, if I
wanted to, which I don't.

03:33.226 --> 03:35.494
But I still could, so
I'm like a God right now,

03:35.495 --> 03:36.495
determining your fate,

03:36.496 --> 03:39.067
so I would choose my next words carefully.

03:39.068 --> 03:41.591
[Claps] Whoo! [Grunts]

03:41.592 --> 03:43.045
Oh.

03:46.932 --> 03:48.166
Hey, is that...

03:48.167 --> 03:50.006
It is!

03:50.007 --> 03:51.763
My old "Farmer Says" toy.

03:56.696 --> 03:59.158
Oh, wow. It's my old math buddy.

03:59.159 --> 04:01.336
Mom said I left you out in the rain.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.201
<i>8 times 8 is...</i>

04:04.202 --> 04:06.362

04:06.363 --> 04:08.538
Oh, no wonder it's down here. It's broken.

04:23.669 --> 04:25.032
Hello, mother.

04:25.033 --> 04:27.001
Look what I found in the basement.

04:29.729 --> 04:30.824
Remember this?

04:30.825 --> 04:32.496
[Siren wailing]

04:32.497 --> 04:33.632
[Chuckles nervously]

04:34.687 --> 04:36.726
You said these disappeared.

04:36.727 --> 04:38.862
Well, they did...

04:38.863 --> 04:41.079
<i>Frankie: With a little help from me.</i>

<i>Automated voice: "A." "A." "A."</i>

04:55.263 --> 04:57.354
Hey, you know what's fun? Reading.

04:59.412 --> 05:00.705
I can't believe you did this.

05:00.706 --> 05:03.320
I could have been a
professional basketball man.

05:03.321 --> 05:06.360
You're always on me 'cause
my nose is buried in a book,

05:06.361 --> 05:08.072
but turns out, it's all your fault.

05:08.073 --> 05:10.656
All because you didn't want
your son to play with his toys.

05:10.657 --> 05:12.600
Sad.

05:12.601 --> 05:14.384
Look, you played with plenty of toys.

05:14.385 --> 05:17.618
Those were just the loud,
annoying, obnoxious ones

05:17.619 --> 05:19.673
I couldn't stand to hear
anymore after the first 500

05:19.674 --> 05:22.432
beep-beeps, ding-dings,
and woo-woo-woos.

05:22.433 --> 05:25.512
Well, seeing how these were ripped from me

05:25.513 --> 05:26.617
at such a young age,

05:26.618 --> 05:29.601
I'm now going to make up
for a lot of lost time.

05:29.602 --> 05:31.185
Come on, old friends.

05:31.186 --> 05:32.905
<i>[Siren wails] Konnichiwa.</i>

05:32.906 --> 05:36.105
Ah, crap, he found the noisy toys.

05:36.106 --> 05:37.185
<i>Mm-hmm. Hola.</i>

05:37.186 --> 05:38.455
Guess what!

05:38.456 --> 05:40.110
Sue, we do a lot of guessing in this house.

05:40.111 --> 05:41.170
Why don't you just tell us?

05:41.171 --> 05:43.314
I was chosen to write the senior play!

05:43.315 --> 05:44.716
- Ha ha!
- Oh.

05:44.717 --> 05:46.899
Well, actually, Brad was chosen,

05:46.900 --> 05:49.644
and then he tapped me,
but it's a huge deal.

05:49.645 --> 05:51.739
I mean, like, parents come,

05:51.740 --> 05:54.468
it's at nighttime, there's beverages.

05:54.469 --> 05:56.467
- Sue, that's great.
- Your mom will go.

05:56.468 --> 06:00.161
And Brad and I decided
we do not just want to do

06:00.162 --> 06:01.458
the usual follies, you know,

06:01.459 --> 06:03.163
like where football
players dress up like girls

06:03.164 --> 06:04.264
and everyone loves it.

06:04.265 --> 06:06.087
No, no, no, no, no.

06:06.088 --> 06:08.596
We want to tackle the real
issues teens are dealing with,

06:08.597 --> 06:10.956
the ones that are living in the shadows,

06:10.957 --> 06:14.292
like, uh, low self-esteem or bulimia.

06:14.293 --> 06:15.860
I don't know. We're still working it out.

06:15.861 --> 06:17.981
But with my new A.C.T. scores

06:17.982 --> 06:20.673
and this groundbreaking
play on my résumé,

06:20.674 --> 06:23.881
there is no limit to
where I can go to college.

06:23.882 --> 06:25.477
Maybe even international.

06:25.478 --> 06:27.307
Like [British accent] Oxford

06:27.308 --> 06:29.872
or [French accent] The Sorbonne.

06:29.873 --> 06:31.528
[Chuckles]

<i>Frankie: So my back was against
the wall, and I was desperate.</i>

06:36.898 --> 06:38.585
<i>I could only see one way out.</i>

06:38.586 --> 06:41.928
So that's one seat,
economy class, to Bermuda.

06:41.929 --> 06:43.328
And that's a one-way ticket.

06:43.329 --> 06:45.520
<i>No, I'm not fleeing my family.</i>

06:45.521 --> 06:46.688
<i>Not yet.</i>

06:46.689 --> 06:48.384
Well, that was my pleasure,

06:48.385 --> 06:50.751
and thank you for flying
Econo Blue Airlines.

06:50.752 --> 06:52.328
[Scoffs]

06:52.329 --> 06:53.656
I am telling you, Mike...

06:53.657 --> 06:55.396
this job is even better than I thought.

06:55.397 --> 06:56.893
I just let them know my schedule,

06:56.894 --> 06:59.339
and they send calls to me... it's perfect.

06:59.340 --> 07:00.946
I can do it in my P.J.s.

07:00.947 --> 07:02.494
I can make dinner if while I work,

07:02.495 --> 07:05.423
I can even do this job in bed if I want to,

07:05.424 --> 07:06.529
and let's face it...

07:06.530 --> 07:08.120
It's the only way I'm
gonna make money in bed.

07:08.121 --> 07:09.232
[Telephone rings]

07:09.233 --> 07:11.407
Thank you for calling
Econo Blue Airlines,

07:11.408 --> 07:12.852
where we put the customer first.

07:12.853 --> 07:13.924
Please hold.

07:13.925 --> 07:15.716
I know we had sprinkles.

07:15.717 --> 07:18.868
Well [Sighs] I'm heading
off to my other job.

07:18.869 --> 07:21.571
And I will be here working at my other job.

07:21.572 --> 07:23.467
You know, I am proud of us, Mike.

07:23.468 --> 07:24.819
We're getting out in front of it.

07:24.820 --> 07:26.316
We're embracing the possible,

07:26.317 --> 07:28.084
and good things are gonna come of it.

07:28.414 --> 07:29.481
[Clicks tongue]

07:29.482 --> 07:31.049
Yep, we've finally achieved our dream

07:31.050 --> 07:32.451
of working around the clock.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.585
Brad: [Grunts]

07:33.586 --> 07:34.953
[Grunts] The other...

07:34.954 --> 07:36.521
oh, okay. Ah!

07:36.522 --> 07:38.790
Mr. Heck, thanks for letting
us work on the play here.

07:38.791 --> 07:40.092
Plenty of room in the basement.

07:40.093 --> 07:42.494
Oh, dad, wait, before you
go, watch this one part.

07:42.495 --> 07:44.463
Sue, I got to get to work. Oh, no, no, no.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.132
But last time, you said you
were just coming home from work.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.400
It's a pretty small window.

07:48.401 --> 07:50.135
Oh, please, please, please.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.371
It'll just take one second!

07:52.372 --> 07:54.473
[High-pitched] Please!

07:54.474 --> 07:55.674
[Laughs]

07:55.675 --> 07:56.942
Okay.

07:56.943 --> 07:58.410
Okay. [Clears throat]

07:58.411 --> 08:01.012
So, we're calling it
"The Loneliest Locker,"

08:01.013 --> 08:04.716
and it's about Savannah,
a lonely bulimic teen

08:04.717 --> 08:08.487
who is bullied and cuts
herself and has anorexia

08:08.488 --> 08:11.990
and problems with alcohol
and abuses A.D.D. medication.

08:11.991 --> 08:12.991
Mm.

08:12.992 --> 08:15.760
I thought she just had bulimia.

08:15.761 --> 08:17.228
So did her mom.

08:17.229 --> 08:19.764
Sounds like Savannah's
got a lot going on there.

08:19.765 --> 08:23.001
Okay, Mr. Heck, imagine this is a hall.

08:23.002 --> 08:24.202
Got it.

08:24.203 --> 08:26.738
Both: Energy, energy, energy. Focus.

08:26.739 --> 08:28.873
[Exhales sharply]

08:28.874 --> 08:31.876
Did you talk to the new girl?

08:31.877 --> 08:34.679
No, I'm not talking to the new girl.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.815
Should we talk to the new girl?

08:36.816 --> 08:38.350
If we talk to the new girl,

08:38.351 --> 08:41.119
then we're the only people
who've talked to the new girl.

08:41.120 --> 08:42.187
Yeah. You're right.

08:42.188 --> 08:43.888
Let's not talk to the new girl.

08:43.889 --> 08:45.924
[Gasps] Freeze.

08:45.925 --> 08:47.225
That's what we said.

08:47.226 --> 08:49.594
Here's what we should have said.

08:49.595 --> 08:51.630
[Both imitate tape rewinding]

08:51.631 --> 08:54.599
Hey, look... there's the new girl.

08:54.600 --> 08:57.602
Let's talk to her at lunch
and welcome her to our school.

08:57.603 --> 08:58.703
Neutral space.

08:58.704 --> 09:00.905
Now we're in the new girl's mind.

09:00.906 --> 09:04.743
[Both whooshing]

09:04.744 --> 09:06.945
[Breathes deeply]

09:06.946 --> 09:08.580
Why won't they talk to me?

09:08.581 --> 09:11.116
I'm crying out for help.

09:11.117 --> 09:15.320
Why did we move here? I
was so happy in Dallas.

09:15.321 --> 09:16.621
Dallas, Dallas, Dallas,
Dallas, Dallas, Dallas.

09:16.622 --> 09:18.023
Dallas, Dallas, Dallas, Dallas, Dallas.

09:18.024 --> 09:20.325
Oh, my God, Sue! That was so good!

09:20.326 --> 09:21.726
We have to write this down.

09:21.727 --> 09:22.861
Dad, did you remember what we said?

09:22.862 --> 09:24.596
Unfortunately, yes.

09:24.597 --> 09:25.830
Dallas, Dallas, Dallas.

09:25.831 --> 09:26.899
- Echo.
- Echo. Dallas echo.

09:29.661 --> 09:32.203
Hold on. Let me check another flight.

09:32.204 --> 09:35.106
As it turned out, the only
problem with working from home

09:35.107 --> 09:37.075
is that I was working from my home.

09:37.076 --> 09:38.943
Automated voice: Flip it. Bop it.

09:38.944 --> 09:40.679
Flip it.

09:40.680 --> 09:43.148
Tap it.

09:43.149 --> 09:45.016
Pull it.

09:45.017 --> 09:48.553
So, as a Platinum Member,
you earned double miles

09:48.554 --> 09:52.157
and you're eligible for a day
pass to our executive club.

09:52.158 --> 09:54.159
Thank you and enjoy your trip.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.695
[Toilet flushes]

09:56.696 --> 09:59.531
Oh, don't worry. The
extra legroom is a rip-off.

09:59.532 --> 10:02.567
It's only like half an
inch. You won't miss it.

10:02.568 --> 10:03.635
Let go.

10:03.636 --> 10:06.004
Why?

10:06.005 --> 10:07.539
It's been there forever.

10:07.540 --> 10:08.607
You only want it 'cause I want it.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.709
I'm gonna crackle-paint it someday.

10:10.710 --> 10:11.877
[Scoffs] Okay. I'm sorry.

10:11.878 --> 10:13.411
If you want to all sit together,

10:13.412 --> 10:14.880
someone's gonna have to
sit in the middle seat.

10:14.881 --> 10:17.682
Mom! Where is the costume box?

10:17.683 --> 10:19.384
It was in the basement.

10:19.385 --> 10:20.619
I'm talking to a customer.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.420
Yeah, hi, Joan. Still here.

10:22.421 --> 10:25.490
If you can take a later flight,
I might be able to get... oh.

10:25.491 --> 10:27.626
No, sorry. There's a
middle seat there, too.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.594
The black cape was in it, and I need it

10:29.595 --> 10:31.730
to play bulimia in "The Loneliest Locker."

10:31.731 --> 10:33.098
[Gasps] Brad doesn't
want to use his good cape.

10:33.099 --> 10:34.699
Oh, yeah, I took that for a shower curtain.

10:34.700 --> 10:37.369
You used my cape as a shower curtain?!

10:37.370 --> 10:39.104
To be fair, it was a shower curtain.

10:39.105 --> 10:41.835
Mom! Make him give me back my cape!

10:41.836 --> 10:43.284
Figure it out. [Door opens, closes]

10:43.285 --> 10:45.744
I got it on the middle seat,
Joan. Just give me a second.

10:45.745 --> 10:47.679
[Toy popping]

10:47.680 --> 10:49.848
Ahh... This takes me back.

10:49.849 --> 10:53.885
Axl, you just show up here,
and you take all our stuff!

10:53.886 --> 10:55.687
- That's so-o-o-o selfish!
- Why?

10:55.688 --> 10:57.155
'Cause I think of myself first?

10:57.156 --> 11:01.026
Uh, it's called being an
American. Check it out.

11:01.027 --> 11:03.962
I get it, Joan! You
don't want a middle seat!

11:03.963 --> 11:05.697
Nobody wants a middle seat!

11:05.698 --> 11:09.401
Well, maybe your mom shouldn't
have died on a Thursday.

11:09.402 --> 11:10.869
Yes.

11:10.870 --> 11:13.139
I'd be happy to connect
you to my supervisor.

11:15.074 --> 11:17.609
Just let me have the... oh, my God!

11:17.610 --> 11:20.446
You don't want any of this!

11:24.417 --> 11:26.885
[Groans]

11:26.886 --> 11:29.087
I'm so glad it's Saturday.

11:29.088 --> 11:32.457
Oh, crap. It's Saturday. I got to work.

11:32.458 --> 11:33.725
[Groans]

11:33.726 --> 11:35.327
What happened to "you never give up,"

11:35.328 --> 11:36.394
and "it's the perfect job"?

11:36.395 --> 11:38.497
Well, it turns out, embracing the possible

11:38.498 --> 11:39.984
doesn't pay all that great.

11:39.985 --> 11:41.598
You think Sue would hate us if we made her

11:41.599 --> 11:42.968
repeat senior year a couple of times?

11:42.969 --> 11:44.603
I'm calling it.

11:44.604 --> 11:46.471
The dream is dead.

11:46.472 --> 11:50.751
You want to tell Sue over nachos
or a ice-cream-sundae tower?

11:50.752 --> 11:52.096
We're not telling her anything right now,

11:52.097 --> 11:54.402
but if we do, definitely
the ice-cream tower.

11:54.403 --> 11:55.751
What are we waiting for, Frankie?

11:55.752 --> 11:58.383
We accidentally got free
premium channels for a month.

11:58.384 --> 12:00.485
We've had our miracle.
It's her senior year, Mike.

12:00.486 --> 12:02.949
You really want to ruin her senior year?

12:02.950 --> 12:04.906
I mean, I can pick up a couple more hours,

12:04.907 --> 12:06.354
maybe get a third job.

12:06.355 --> 12:08.434
Yeah, right. And who knows?

12:08.435 --> 12:10.837
I'm so tired, maybe I'll
fall in a hole at the quarry,

12:10.838 --> 12:12.238
and we'll all hit the jackpot.

12:12.239 --> 12:14.581
Well, we can't count on
that, but I like the attitude.

12:14.582 --> 12:16.717
Okay.

12:16.718 --> 12:17.901
- [Headset clatters]
- [Clears throat]

12:18.576 --> 12:20.193
Are you serious?

12:20.194 --> 12:22.105
He took my nightstand.

12:22.778 --> 12:24.482
There were cookies in there.

12:25.951 --> 12:27.063
[Scoffs] Don't you see?

12:27.064 --> 12:28.687
If Savannah doesn't find her way back,

12:28.688 --> 12:31.281
her dreams of one day becoming
a senator/jewelry designer

12:31.282 --> 12:33.415
don't come true... that's reality, Sue.

12:33.416 --> 12:34.591
You know what, Brad?

12:34.592 --> 12:36.752
I didn't want to say
anything, but you have been

12:36.753 --> 12:38.640
very controlling
throughout this whole thing.

12:38.641 --> 12:40.576
Well, I'm sorry, but
some of the best directors

12:40.577 --> 12:43.311
have not been well-liked...
Barbra Streisand.

12:43.312 --> 12:44.645
I-I can't think of any others.

12:44.646 --> 12:46.215
Anyway, I'm sorry, Sue,

12:46.216 --> 12:48.262
but the ending of the
play needs to be darker.

12:48.263 --> 12:50.614
No one befriends Savannah.
She ends up alone.

12:50.615 --> 12:52.166
It'll have so much more impact.

12:52.167 --> 12:54.918
No! Savannah needs to have hope

12:54.919 --> 12:57.006
and believe that things
are going to work out.

12:57.007 --> 12:59.118
That's what people want. Right, guys?

12:59.119 --> 13:00.358
That's right.

13:00.359 --> 13:03.015
Well, actually, Sue, I got to go with Brad.

13:03.016 --> 13:04.518
Sometimes you got to be realistic.

13:04.519 --> 13:06.686
People do better in life
when they face facts.

13:06.687 --> 13:08.078
Dad!

13:08.079 --> 13:09.581
Oh, Sue's right.

13:09.582 --> 13:12.966
If you don't have hope,
Mike, you don't have anything.

13:12.967 --> 13:15.385
Well, maybe if Savannah's parents

13:15.386 --> 13:17.011
had been more honest with
her from the beginning,

13:17.012 --> 13:18.145
she would never have gotten all of these

13:18.146 --> 13:20.583
pie-in-the-sky ideas that
never were gonna happen.

13:20.584 --> 13:23.440
Oh, yeah? Maybe Savannah's
parents told her the truth

13:23.441 --> 13:25.743
and dashed her dreams and
sent her down a bad path.

13:25.744 --> 13:28.613
Well, I happen to have a little
more faith in Savannah than that.

13:28.614 --> 13:29.887
I think she can handle it.

13:29.888 --> 13:31.646
Hope's a powerful thing, Mike.

13:31.647 --> 13:33.204
You never know what might come of it.

13:33.205 --> 13:35.804
Okay, you and Savannah
go live in the fairy world

13:35.805 --> 13:38.132
where she's heading for
a big disappointment,

13:38.133 --> 13:40.229
and no one that loves
her protected her from it.

13:40.230 --> 13:41.580
[Sighs]

13:41.581 --> 13:43.029
My body's tingling.

13:43.030 --> 13:45.069
We just moved people with art.

13:50.416 --> 13:51.917
All right, that's it!

13:54.364 --> 13:56.137
- Cookie man.
-  Oh!

13:59.177 --> 14:01.028
[Laughs] Yes!

14:01.029 --> 14:02.756
- [Knock on door]
- It's open!

14:02.757 --> 14:04.046
Up.

14:04.047 --> 14:06.214
Oh. [Groans]

14:07.980 --> 14:09.660
Oh, but those are our cushions.

14:09.661 --> 14:10.756
I know.

14:11.147 --> 14:12.217
[Sighs]

14:12.818 --> 14:14.823
- That was harsh.
- Way harsh.

14:17.924 --> 14:19.480
[Cash register beeping]
Automated voice: 45 cents.

14:19.481 --> 14:21.956
One dollar. Let's play.

14:21.957 --> 14:24.403
I did not think our home
could become more annoying,

14:24.404 --> 14:25.900
and yet, it has.

14:25.901 --> 14:29.172
[Gasping] Oh, my God. I am so nervous.

14:30.099 --> 14:33.067
I am the director, producer, star,

14:33.068 --> 14:35.030
and I designed the programs.

14:35.031 --> 14:38.032
This is what Ryan Seacrest
must feel like every day.

14:38.341 --> 14:40.466
Okay, come on, come on. I can't be late.

14:41.126 --> 14:42.153
[Cash register beeping] Two dollars.

14:42.154 --> 14:43.939
Brick, turn that thing off. We're leaving.

14:43.940 --> 14:45.941
- [Telephone rings]
- You know, if you would have just let me

14:45.942 --> 14:47.169
play with this when I was little,

14:47.170 --> 14:49.040
it would have been lost a long time ago.

14:49.041 --> 14:50.745
Ironic, isn't it?

14:50.746 --> 14:52.972
Frankie: Okay, you're
not gonna believe this.

14:52.973 --> 14:54.035
That was work.

14:54.036 --> 14:56.150
Severe thunderstorms have
shut down the Atlanta Airport,

14:56.151 --> 14:58.865
and they want everybody on the
phone to reroute passengers.

14:58.866 --> 15:01.171
What?! But that means
you're gonna miss my play!

15:01.172 --> 15:02.921
Mom, I don't think you're
getting how big of a deal this is.

15:02.922 --> 15:05.649
The vice principal and the
nurse are going to be there,

15:05.650 --> 15:07.712
so, yeah, it's a huge deal.

15:07.713 --> 15:09.377
Look, Sue, I'll be there.

15:09.378 --> 15:10.932
It's... it's just that
this pays time-and-a-half,

15:10.933 --> 15:12.870
and it's a new job, and I got to do it.

15:12.871 --> 15:14.339
You go and be great,

15:14.340 --> 15:15.930
and I'll be there before
the curtain goes up...

15:15.931 --> 15:18.420
- I promise.
- Okay, but don't be late

15:18.421 --> 15:19.471
because if you miss the opening

15:19.472 --> 15:21.111
"Dream Dance Within a
Dream Dance" sequence,

15:21.112 --> 15:23.335
the rest of the play won't make sense.

15:34.167 --> 15:35.740
Whose locker is that?

15:35.741 --> 15:37.300
It's the new girl's.

15:37.301 --> 15:39.236
I think her name is Savannah or something.

15:39.237 --> 15:40.948
Have you talked to her?

15:40.949 --> 15:43.076
[Scoffs] I can't talk to her.

15:43.077 --> 15:44.812
I'm quarterback of the football team.

15:44.813 --> 15:47.092
[Scoffs] Well, I can't talk to her.

15:47.093 --> 15:48.686
I'm top cheerleader.

15:48.687 --> 15:52.605
Look, somebody'll talk to
her, maybe some uncool kids.

15:52.606 --> 15:56.314
Mm-hmm. The new girl's
not really our problem.

15:59.206 --> 16:00.641
Oh! [Gasps]

16:01.483 --> 16:03.874
God, I'm not even a part
of this family anymore.

16:03.875 --> 16:05.607
Why do I have to sit
through Sue's lame plays?

16:05.608 --> 16:07.310
'Cause it's a big deal to your sister,

16:07.311 --> 16:08.781
and for every hour you sit through it,

16:08.782 --> 16:09.949
you earn back a cushion.

16:12.327 --> 16:14.060
Florida. Tallahassee.

16:14.061 --> 16:15.896
I'm sorry, but we don't
control the weather.

16:15.897 --> 16:18.160
Yeah, if we did, it would
be sunny all the time.

16:18.161 --> 16:20.215
- [Laughs]
- Florida. Tallahassee.

16:20.216 --> 16:21.331
I know, and I'm gonna get you
to Tallahassee, if it's the I...

16:21.332 --> 16:23.245
Florida. Tallahassee.

16:23.246 --> 16:25.120
I-I-I'm sorry. Did I say Tallahassee?

16:25.121 --> 16:26.705
- I meant Chicago!
- Florida. Tallahassee.

16:26.706 --> 16:28.359
I don't know what made me say Tallahassee!

16:28.360 --> 16:30.031
Florida. Tallahassee.

16:30.032 --> 16:32.830
- No, I understand your frustration.
- Florida. Tallahassee.

16:32.831 --> 16:33.957
And I am doing everything I can

16:33.958 --> 16:35.904
- to resolve this to your satisfaction.
- Florida. Tallahassee.

I am Bulimia.

bathroom wall, but you ignore me.

I am depression.

16:46.971 --> 16:49.745
You give me a cinnamon roll
and beg me to get off the couch.

- Yes!
- Sue: I am negative thoughts.

yelling made you feel better.

Yeah, I know. I know I'm not there.

17:18.502 --> 17:20.086
But I am doing my best.

17:20.087 --> 17:21.766
Well, Sue's asking for you.

17:21.767 --> 17:23.606
Look, I'm trying, but the storm

17:23.607 --> 17:25.382
grounded like a million flights.

17:25.383 --> 17:27.430
Well, you've already missed half the play.

17:27.431 --> 17:28.853
At least, I hope it's half.

17:28.854 --> 17:30.286
I understand your frustration,

17:30.287 --> 17:32.455
and I assure you I am doing all I can

17:32.456 --> 17:34.214
to resolve this to your satisfaction.

17:34.215 --> 17:36.426
Hey! Don't Econo Blue me.

17:36.427 --> 17:37.839
All right. Got to go.

17:39.896 --> 17:40.983
You know, Clark,

17:40.984 --> 17:43.525
I wish we would have
reached out to Savannah.

17:43.526 --> 17:46.086
Savannah's gone. Forget about her.

17:46.087 --> 17:48.937
Instead, feel the wind
in your hair in my jeep.

17:49.374 --> 17:51.460
Maybe I could Instagram Savannah.

17:51.461 --> 17:53.289
It's too late, Skyler.

17:53.290 --> 17:55.865
She left, and now she's beyond help.

17:55.866 --> 17:59.809
But not completely beyond
help because she has hope.

17:59.810 --> 18:02.777
But the point is it happened,

18:02.778 --> 18:06.297
and we will always, always remember...

18:06.298 --> 18:08.625
Both: The Loneliest Locker.

18:10.212 --> 18:12.440
I had a lonely locker.

18:12.441 --> 18:15.663
I've had a lonely locker, too. Have you?

18:15.664 --> 18:17.272
Or you? Or you?

18:18.009 --> 18:21.510
We've all had The Loneliest Locker.

18:21.511 --> 18:23.014

19:10.817 --> 19:13.470
Well, have fun and thank you
for choosing Econo Blue Airlines.

19:16.805 --> 19:18.028
Where were you?

19:18.029 --> 19:20.428
You promised you'd be
there, and you missed it.

19:20.429 --> 19:22.168
You missed my senior play,

19:22.169 --> 19:24.991
and it'll never happen again,
and it was a huge success.

19:24.992 --> 19:26.914
- Tell her, dad.
- Yep.

19:26.915 --> 19:28.858
I think the third ending was my favorite.

19:28.859 --> 19:30.033
Brick: I liked the puppets.

19:30.034 --> 19:32.650
I was shocked at how many
meds bipolar bear had to take

19:32.651 --> 19:33.672
to get through the day.

19:35.247 --> 19:37.591
Sue, I am so, so sorry.

19:37.592 --> 19:40.202
You said you'd come before the
curtain came up, and you didn't.

19:40.203 --> 19:42.655
You know, even Axl came,
and he didn't have to.

19:42.656 --> 19:43.656
He was just being nice.

19:43.657 --> 19:45.709
Look, I tried, Sue. I really did.

19:45.710 --> 19:48.852
But I just started this job,
and I can't get fired, okay?

19:48.853 --> 19:50.772
Why did you even take this job, anyway?!

19:50.773 --> 19:52.142
You're already so busy!

19:52.143 --> 19:53.233
Well, it's not like I wanted...

19:53.234 --> 19:56.039
Oh! You're missing my whole senior year!

19:56.040 --> 19:57.993
You're just missing everything.

19:57.994 --> 20:00.490
You want to know why, Sue?
Do you want to know why?

20:00.491 --> 20:02.324
Because I don't know how we're gonna pay

20:02.325 --> 20:03.757
for your college, all right?

20:03.758 --> 20:06.188
I mean, I am trying really hard here

20:06.189 --> 20:08.162
to embrace the possible, but you know what?

20:08.163 --> 20:10.081
It's just getting harder and harder

20:10.082 --> 20:13.185
because you want to go to all
these great and awesome places,

20:13.186 --> 20:15.982
and we want to send you there,

20:15.983 --> 20:17.226
but to tell you the truth,

20:17.227 --> 20:19.386
I just don't know how it's gonna happen.

20:20.443 --> 20:22.490
I just don't know at all.

20:22.491 --> 20:24.386
[Sighs]

20:24.387 --> 20:26.316
I wanted to tell you at Chili's.

20:33.380 --> 20:35.229
Look, I know.

20:35.230 --> 20:38.489
I know we can't afford
any of those schools.

20:38.490 --> 20:42.666
I was just talking and
dreaming and stuff for fun,

20:42.667 --> 20:46.490
but I would never want to do anything

20:46.491 --> 20:48.422
that would make you
guys have to work harder.

20:48.423 --> 20:50.790
You guys work so hard already.

20:50.791 --> 20:54.925
But I love you,

20:54.926 --> 20:56.998
and honestly, honestly, honestly,

20:56.999 --> 20:58.919
please don't kill yourself for me.

20:58.920 --> 21:02.358
Whatever happens, I am gonna be fine.

21:03.911 --> 21:07.532
[Sighs] Oh, she's so sweet and wonderful.

21:08.187 --> 21:10.503
The best. How'd we get a kid this great?

21:10.504 --> 21:11.752
I have no idea.

21:11.753 --> 21:13.127
She deserves to go to college

21:13.128 --> 21:15.104
wherever she wants, whatever it costs.

21:15.105 --> 21:16.288
No matter what it takes.

21:16.289 --> 21:18.236
- Third jobs, even.
- Done.

21:18.237 --> 21:19.667
[Sighs]

21:19.668 --> 21:21.756
Just don't let her major in theater.
