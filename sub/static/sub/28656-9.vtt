ELEMENTARY #709
"On The Scent"
Closed Captioned

00:00.834 --> 00:02.336
Previously on Elementary...
And that, folks,

00:02.336 --> 00:04.638
is the principle
on which Odker was built.

00:04.638 --> 00:06.707
Simple solutions

00:06.707 --> 00:09.476
for complicated problems.

00:09.476 --> 00:11.245
Well, you can call me Odin.
My friends do.

00:11.245 --> 00:12.713
I haven’t decided
if we’re going to be friends.

00:12.713 --> 00:16.383
I have saved hundreds of lives.

00:16.383 --> 00:18.719
You two understand
the criminal mind.

00:18.719 --> 00:21.388
Together, we could avert
so many tragedies.

00:21.388 --> 00:24.925
What on earth makes you think
that we would ever consider

00:24.925 --> 00:27.227
joining your stable
of executioners?

00:27.227 --> 00:30.197
Might be nice to help prevent
some murders for a change.

00:30.197 --> 00:31.732
Watson and I
are very interested.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.901
But it would have
to be on our terms.

00:33.901 --> 00:37.671
We would vet every single case
to 100% certainty

00:37.671 --> 00:39.873
before you did the irrevocable.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.341
We got everything.

00:41.341 --> 00:43.277
Now we’re gonna start a case.

00:43.277 --> 00:45.412
Is the entire NSA
in Odin’s pocket,

00:45.412 --> 00:47.447
or is it just you?

00:50.117 --> 00:52.052
Come to that, has it?

00:52.052 --> 00:55.255
Well, what’s a little murder
if you can stop the next 9/11?

00:55.255 --> 00:56.690
Our friend doesn’t want
to hurt any of you,

00:56.690 --> 00:57.891
but I think it’s
important you realize

00:57.891 --> 00:59.693
he could hurt all of you.

00:59.693 --> 01:00.961
How’d it go with McNally?

01:00.961 --> 01:02.796
HOLMES: The NSA
has opened a case,

01:02.796 --> 01:05.132
so there’s nothing more
for us to do.

01:11.204 --> 01:13.206
Oh, that’s what you do
down here.

01:13.206 --> 01:15.809
I’m working.
You missed a call

01:15.809 --> 01:17.744
from the Maricopa County
Sheriff’s Office.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.580
Struck me as odd.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.448
Didn’t think you’d
ever been to Arizona.

01:21.448 --> 01:24.284
Not in real life, anyway.
Yeah, I’ve been looking into

01:24.284 --> 01:25.586
this murder in Phoenix.

01:25.586 --> 01:26.753
So, two weeks ago,

01:26.753 --> 01:28.322
a man named Parker Landis

01:28.322 --> 01:30.123
was driving home,
and he was rear-ended.

01:30.123 --> 01:32.426
He got out of his car
to yell at the other driver.

01:32.426 --> 01:35.095
Then the guy shot him
and then fled.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.663
So no one got a good look

01:36.663 --> 01:38.932
at the shooter’s face
or the license plate.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.901
There are myriad crimes to solve
here in New York.

01:40.901 --> 01:42.836
If it’s mundane
commuter violence you’re after,

01:42.836 --> 01:45.172
you need look no further
than the Bronx River Parkway.

01:45.172 --> 01:46.473
Well, that’s just the thing.

01:46.473 --> 01:48.108
I don’t think
this case is mundane.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.644
So I’ve been trying to recreate
the collision

01:50.644 --> 01:52.312
because I think
Parker’s assailant

01:52.312 --> 01:54.081
hit his car on purpose.

01:54.081 --> 01:55.315
Why would he do that?

01:55.315 --> 01:59.152
This is why.

01:59.152 --> 02:00.654
So two days ago,
his sister went

02:00.654 --> 02:02.589
to clean out his apartment
and found a stash

02:02.589 --> 02:04.324
of botulism samples.

02:04.324 --> 02:06.827
He must have stolen it
from the lab where he worked.

02:06.827 --> 02:09.763
She also found a list of buffet
restaurants in the area.

02:09.763 --> 02:11.164
Landis was plotting
a mass poisoning?

02:11.164 --> 02:13.834
But he was killed before
he could go through with it.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.836
You think Odin Reichenbach
is responsible.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.471
He orchestrated Landis’s death

02:17.471 --> 02:19.373
to stop him
from carrying out his plot?

02:19.373 --> 02:20.807
It sounds like him, right?

02:20.807 --> 02:22.642
So the call I missed
was from the detective

02:22.642 --> 02:24.044
handling the case.

02:24.044 --> 02:25.712
She chalked up
the shooting to road rage.

02:25.712 --> 02:27.214
But I left her a message saying

02:27.214 --> 02:28.482
she might want
to take another look.

02:28.482 --> 02:29.816
You told her about Odin?

02:29.816 --> 02:32.185
No. A megalomaniacal billionaire

02:32.185 --> 02:33.854
preemptively
assassinating anyone

02:33.854 --> 02:35.656
who says the wrong thing
in an e-mail?

02:35.656 --> 02:37.357
She would think I was nuts.

02:37.357 --> 02:39.626
I just gave her my number
and said she could reach out

02:39.626 --> 02:41.828
if she wanted help
IDing the killer.

02:41.828 --> 02:43.897
You should disengage.

02:43.897 --> 02:46.500
What do you mean?
If that detective

02:46.500 --> 02:48.635
shares her file, we could
help her find the triggerman.

02:48.635 --> 02:50.404
Put a dent in Odin’s operation.

02:50.404 --> 02:51.638
It’s not ours to dent.

02:51.638 --> 02:53.540
Odin Reichenbach has
immeasurable resources

02:53.540 --> 02:55.242
and power.

02:55.242 --> 02:56.843
The people investigating him
should, too, which is why

02:56.843 --> 02:59.246
we entrusted this to the NSA.

02:59.246 --> 03:01.681
That was a mutual decision,
you’ll recall.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.550
Sure, but...
I could share
your concerns

03:03.550 --> 03:06.553
with Agent McNally.
I’m sure he’d appreciate it.

03:06.553 --> 03:09.656
But moving forward,
we should leave this to the NSA.

03:09.656 --> 03:11.658
Inserting ourselves
in their case...

03:11.658 --> 03:13.794
it could cause untold problems.

What, uh... a-a friend
of mine reached out...

05:04.771 --> 05:07.941
A friend of mine reached
out from the French police.

05:07.941 --> 05:10.610
Someone robbed and sank a
yacht off the coast of Toulon.

05:10.610 --> 05:12.212
I reviewed the case file,

05:12.212 --> 05:14.481
and I think that the
police have it backwards.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.983
I think the thief sank the boat
first, and then plundered it.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.385
So I’m just doing
some experiments

05:18.385 --> 05:19.819
with underwater safecracking.

05:19.819 --> 05:22.856
No. What is this?

05:22.856 --> 05:25.158
I found it under a stack
of books in the library.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.661
You said you were gonna give it
to Agent McNally two days ago.

05:27.661 --> 05:30.797
I was, I-I am, I just, I’ve been
busy. Uh, my apologies.

05:30.797 --> 05:31.865
You know how important
this is.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.200
(phone chimes)
This could be

05:33.200 --> 05:35.702
a real lead on Odin.
McNally needs to see it.

05:35.702 --> 05:37.070
He will, just not right now.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.205
We’re needed
at the 11th immediately.

05:38.205 --> 05:41.241
All hands on
deck, apparently.

05:41.241 --> 05:43.810
The NYPD needs help
finding a ghost.

05:45.212 --> 05:47.314
GREGSON:
The Ghost of Brooklyn.

05:47.314 --> 05:48.848
Strangest serial killer
I can recall.

05:48.848 --> 05:50.050
You two remember him?

05:50.050 --> 05:51.751
Of course. Early 2000s.

05:51.751 --> 05:54.221
I was in the middle of my
residency. I read all about him.

05:54.221 --> 05:56.389
I was still in London.
I’ve never heard of him.

05:56.389 --> 05:58.024
I take it he killed
four people?

05:58.024 --> 06:00.327
His DNA first showed up
at a murder scene in Bushwick,

06:00.327 --> 06:02.429
January 2000.
He went on to kill

06:02.429 --> 06:04.431
three more people
in the tristate area

06:04.431 --> 06:05.899
over the next
nine years.

06:05.899 --> 06:09.069
There was no discernible pattern
to his victims.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.704
Different MO every time.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.038
That’s unusual for a serial.

06:12.038 --> 06:13.440
BELL:
Unusual for them to stop

06:13.440 --> 06:16.443
on their own, too, but
we thought maybe the Ghost did.

06:16.443 --> 06:19.713
Ten years went by without
a trace of his DNA turning up.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.715
Everyone figured he was
either dead or retired,

06:21.715 --> 06:24.251
but then, he struck again
two nights ago.

06:24.251 --> 06:27.354
Caroline Gibbs.

06:27.354 --> 06:29.889
Do I know that name?
If you’re into
sculpture.

06:29.889 --> 06:31.224
She was an artist,
made stuff out of metal.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.093
Lived on Staten Island.

06:33.093 --> 06:35.228
Neighbors said her dogs wouldn’t
stop barking Tuesday night.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.896
They went over to check it out,
found Caroline

06:36.896 --> 06:39.399
with her head
bashed in.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.635
The murder weapon was
just a piece of scrap metal

06:41.635 --> 06:43.570
the killer found at the scene.
It’s not gonna help us

06:43.570 --> 06:47.374
find the guy,
but maybe this will.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.148
Looks like part of a shirt.

06:55.148 --> 06:56.783
BELL:
The killer’s.

06:56.783 --> 06:58.385
CSU figures
one of the victim’s dogs

06:58.385 --> 06:59.920
went after him, tore it off.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.755
Initially, detectives
out of the 1-2-5

07:01.755 --> 07:04.224
caught the case.
They were starting to circle

07:04.224 --> 07:07.060
a rival artist, someone who
had a beef with Caroline.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.629
But then the lab report
on that fabric came back.

07:09.629 --> 07:11.731
It has the Ghost’s DNA on it.

07:11.731 --> 07:13.300
This is everything
we’ve got on the guy.

07:13.300 --> 07:15.635
All four of the original cases,
plus the new one.

07:15.635 --> 07:18.138
This whole investigation
has been kicked up to us,

07:18.138 --> 07:20.307
so let’s get on it.

07:20.307 --> 07:23.143
HUTCHINS:
Megan’s been gone 15 years now.

07:23.143 --> 07:25.478
In a way, though,

07:25.478 --> 07:28.114
I feel like I just
lost her yesterday.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.917
When we stopped hearing

07:30.917 --> 07:32.786
about the Ghost of Brooklyn
on the news,

07:32.786 --> 07:36.156
I hoped it meant he was dead.

07:36.156 --> 07:38.992
Finally in hell,
where he belongs.

07:38.992 --> 07:41.361
We’re gonna find him
this time, Mr. Hutchins.

07:41.361 --> 07:45.131
You said you thought
I could help you.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.533
How?

07:46.533 --> 07:48.134
During the original
string of murders,

07:48.134 --> 07:50.303
you were the closest
anyone got to witnessing

07:50.303 --> 07:52.205
one of the Ghost’s crimes.

07:52.205 --> 07:55.675
We have your statement, but we
thought it might help if you

07:55.675 --> 07:58.511
walked us through what you saw
the night you found Megan.

07:58.511 --> 08:00.447
HOLMES: We know
it’s difficult.

08:00.447 --> 08:02.015
But in the light
of the recent murder,

08:02.015 --> 08:04.451
any detail which might have
seemed trivial then

08:04.451 --> 08:07.354
could be hugely important now.

08:07.354 --> 08:11.191
Well, the, the night she died,

08:11.191 --> 08:13.393
we were supposed to have dinner.

08:13.393 --> 08:16.229
I went to pick her up,

08:16.229 --> 08:19.866
but there was no answer
when I knocked on her door.

08:19.866 --> 08:23.069
So I looked through
the window and, uh...

08:25.572 --> 08:28.575
...she was on the ground.

08:28.575 --> 08:30.343
Rope around her neck.

08:30.343 --> 08:33.146
I broke the door down

08:33.146 --> 08:35.415
and I ran to her and...

08:35.415 --> 08:37.417
She was already gone?

08:37.417 --> 08:40.420
Yeah. Her body was still warm.

08:40.420 --> 08:43.590
I must have just missed him.

08:43.590 --> 08:47.861
Did you see anyone suspicious
as you approached the house?

08:47.861 --> 08:49.195
No.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.898
But I heard
this sound.

08:51.898 --> 08:56.102
It was, uh, my son-in-law’s car
on the road behind the house.

08:56.102 --> 08:57.604
Megan’s husband,

08:57.604 --> 08:59.606
Dean Voight?

08:59.606 --> 09:03.042
Mm-hmm. I’d recognize
the sound of his car anywhere.

09:03.042 --> 09:05.445
I was always telling him
he needed a new fan belt.

09:05.445 --> 09:07.180
File says

09:07.180 --> 09:10.050
Dean told police he was working
in his garage that night.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.352
He left to pick up
some groceries

09:12.352 --> 09:14.220
around the time you showed up.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.856
Yeah. Not that he had
any groceries with him

09:16.856 --> 09:19.259
when he came home and found
his house full of cops.

09:19.259 --> 09:20.927
You think he lied?

09:20.927 --> 09:22.796
I thought he killed Megan.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.931
Everybody did.

09:24.931 --> 09:28.134
It came out
he was cheating on her.

09:28.134 --> 09:33.640
But DNA on the rope matched
the Ghost of Brooklyn,

09:33.640 --> 09:37.477
and, um, Dean had alibis
for all the other murders.

09:37.477 --> 09:38.945
You know where we can find him?

09:38.945 --> 09:40.547
Sure.

09:40.547 --> 09:43.316
Frost Cemetery in Queens.

09:43.316 --> 09:45.218
He’s deceased?

09:45.218 --> 09:47.454
Shot himself.

09:47.454 --> 09:50.056
July 29, 2005.

09:50.056 --> 09:53.460
Anniversary of Megan’s death.

09:53.460 --> 09:56.463
There was a note.
It just said, uh, "I’m sorry."

09:56.463 --> 09:57.931
For?

09:57.931 --> 10:00.099
Killing himself.

10:00.099 --> 10:01.634
Not for his part
in Megan’s demise?

10:01.634 --> 10:04.471
No. I mean,

10:04.471 --> 10:08.141
there was a DNA test
that pointed to somebody else.

10:08.141 --> 10:10.343
Y-You always thought
he was the culprit.

10:10.343 --> 10:12.779
Well, yeah.

10:12.779 --> 10:15.348
He was there that night.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.951
I thought
he was fleeing the scene.

10:17.951 --> 10:18.952
Man kills himself

10:18.952 --> 10:19.953
on the one-year
anniversary

10:19.953 --> 10:21.354
of a wife
he didn’t kill.

10:21.354 --> 10:23.123
Sound right to you?

10:23.123 --> 10:24.624
The DNA

10:24.624 --> 10:26.926
might be worth
another look.

10:28.828 --> 10:33.166
MAN: Your side’s
got to go up, Aspen.

10:33.166 --> 10:36.302
Get it square. Come on.

10:37.437 --> 10:39.772
These are intense.

10:39.772 --> 10:42.208
Gallery’s closed, love.

10:42.208 --> 10:44.210
You’re Carson Mayfield,
right?

10:44.210 --> 10:46.312
Oh. The caterer.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.448
Actually, my name
is Joan Watson.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.383
I’m a consultant
for the NYPD.

10:50.383 --> 10:53.052
I’m investigating the
murder of Caroline Gibbs.

10:53.052 --> 10:56.222
Two detectives on Staten Island
suggested I speak with you.

10:56.222 --> 10:59.125
Can you give us
a moment, please?

11:00.293 --> 11:02.695
You just said
Caroline is dead?

11:02.695 --> 11:04.297
Are you saying
you didn’t know?

11:04.297 --> 11:06.966
I’ve been completely consumed,
getting ready for this opening.

11:06.966 --> 11:09.869
It happened Tuesday
night, around 8:00.

11:09.869 --> 11:11.704
Can you tell me
where you were then?

11:11.704 --> 11:13.172
Home. Working.

11:13.172 --> 11:14.974
Alone?
Yes.

11:14.974 --> 11:16.976
I’m confused.

11:16.976 --> 11:18.745
Do you think I killed Caroline?

11:18.745 --> 11:21.981
I heard the two of you got
into an ugly fight a month ago.

11:21.981 --> 11:23.383
Oh, my God.

11:23.383 --> 11:24.851
Can you tell me what
the fight was about?

11:24.851 --> 11:26.586
It wasn’t a real fight.

11:26.586 --> 11:29.222
That’s not what the Staten
Island police heard.

11:29.222 --> 11:30.523
No, you don’t understand.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.659
It literally wasn’t real.
It was fake.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.428
(sighs)
Um,

11:35.428 --> 11:38.264
she threw a drink at me
at a party.

11:38.264 --> 11:40.099
We yelled, talked trash online.

11:40.099 --> 11:41.935
But it was all just
a performance.

11:41.935 --> 11:45.038
We were organizing an exhibition
together for next year,

11:45.038 --> 11:47.941
and we figured we could drum up
some extra interest if we,

11:47.941 --> 11:50.877
you know, stirred the pot.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.879
So you’re saying the fight
was a publicity stunt?

11:52.879 --> 11:55.281
Exactly. Make everyone
think we’re at war,

11:55.281 --> 11:57.717
then reconcile through art.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.887
Here, I’ll show you.

12:04.691 --> 12:05.792
This was last week.

12:08.394 --> 12:12.065
Caroline was a brilliant artist

12:12.065 --> 12:14.067
and a very dear friend.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.769
Her death is a travesty for me
on every level.

12:16.769 --> 12:18.771
The killer left his DNA
at the scene.

12:18.771 --> 12:21.040
Would you be willing
to give the police a sample?

12:21.040 --> 12:22.408
Anything.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.744
But I’m not the only one
who needs to be tested.

12:24.744 --> 12:28.081
When I was at Caroline’s,
this guy turned up and demanded

12:28.081 --> 12:29.916
to talk to her.
They stepped outside,

12:29.916 --> 12:31.718
and, right away,
he began yelling at her.

12:31.718 --> 12:35.288
So I went out to make sure
Caroline was okay.

12:35.288 --> 12:36.823
Hey! What are you doing?

12:36.823 --> 12:39.258
Hey, turn that off.
I’ve got you on video.

12:39.258 --> 12:41.227
Stop yelling at her.
I said turn it off!

12:41.227 --> 12:43.763
Who is he?
Caroline’s
next-door neighbor.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.132
She said his name
was Benjamin or something.

12:46.132 --> 12:47.567
Do you know why he was so upset?

12:47.567 --> 12:48.968
I didn’t catch
everything he said,

12:48.968 --> 12:51.471
but I’m pretty sure
I heard the word "affair."

12:51.471 --> 12:53.506
So you think
he was sleeping with Caroline?

12:53.506 --> 12:55.108
I didn’t want to think it.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.110
The man was such an ass.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.745
But after he left,
Caroline said

12:58.745 --> 13:00.246
she didn’t want
to talk about it.

13:01.347 --> 13:02.615
I’m telling you,

13:02.615 --> 13:04.283
that’s what a killer
looks like.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.423
WATSON: His name is
Benjamin Long. He lives

13:10.423 --> 13:12.859
next to Caroline Gibbs.
The artist I spoke to

13:12.859 --> 13:14.293
caught them arguing last week.

13:14.293 --> 13:15.828
He thinks they were
having an affair.

13:15.828 --> 13:17.764
You think he’s the Ghost?

13:17.764 --> 13:19.932
Well, as far as I could
tell, he’s lived in New
York his entire life.

13:19.932 --> 13:22.201
He would’ve been here for
the initial string of murders.

13:22.201 --> 13:23.936
HOLMES:
He isn’t the Ghost.

13:23.936 --> 13:25.972
Whoever you’re considering,
it isn’t him.

13:25.972 --> 13:28.541
How do you know?
’Cause Marcus and I
just found the Ghost.

13:28.541 --> 13:30.376
He’s sitting in interrogation.

13:30.376 --> 13:33.212
I don’t know what I was
expecting the Ghost

13:33.212 --> 13:35.381
to look like,
but it wasn’t him.

13:35.381 --> 13:37.216
His name is Albert Wu.

13:37.216 --> 13:39.886
He’s a manager
at Northeast Med Tech.

13:39.886 --> 13:41.788
I know that company.
They make the DNA kits

13:41.788 --> 13:43.222
used by the department.

13:43.222 --> 13:44.891
BELL: Mr. Wu started
working for them in 1999,

13:44.891 --> 13:47.393
a year before the Ghost
became active.

13:47.393 --> 13:49.896
Spent ten years
on their factory floor,

13:49.896 --> 13:51.831
packaging their DNA
collection swabs.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.700
You’re kidding me.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.535
In 2009,
he was promoted to manager

13:55.535 --> 13:57.904
and stopped having
direct contact with the swabs.

13:57.904 --> 14:00.506
Until a few months ago,
when he helped a sick coworker

14:00.506 --> 14:02.075
by covering a few
of their packaging shifts.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.910
It was the first time
he’d been on the factory floor

14:03.910 --> 14:05.178
since his promotion.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.846
So the reason
there was no discernible pattern

14:06.846 --> 14:08.247
to the Ghost of Brooklyn’s
victims

14:08.247 --> 14:10.683
and the reason
no one could find him...

14:10.683 --> 14:12.351
Is the Ghost of Brooklyn
doesn’t exist.

14:12.351 --> 14:14.187
It was just Mr. Wu,

14:14.187 --> 14:16.322
obliviously
contaminating swabs.

14:16.322 --> 14:18.524
He has a condition
called hyperhidrosis.

14:18.524 --> 14:21.594
He sweats a lot. We’re guessing
that’s what caused the problem.

14:21.594 --> 14:22.995
How did you find him?

14:22.995 --> 14:24.230
We talked to a relative

14:24.230 --> 14:25.898
of one of the Ghost’s
supposed victims.

14:25.898 --> 14:27.900
He was convinced that
the culprit was his son-in-law.

14:27.900 --> 14:29.736
After reviewing the case,
I was, too.

14:29.736 --> 14:32.371
But the DNA results all
pointed to the Ghost.

14:32.371 --> 14:34.207
We went through another
one of the Ghost’s cases,

14:34.207 --> 14:37.176
and it was a similar situation,
so we started looking

14:37.176 --> 14:39.178
at the DNA tests themselves,
and wound up

14:39.178 --> 14:40.913
at Northeast Med Tech.

14:40.913 --> 14:43.382
You can call off
the ghost hunt, Captain.

14:43.382 --> 14:47.120
Albert Wu didn’t hurt anyone,
including Caroline Gibbs.

14:56.295 --> 14:59.198
I just got off the phone
with the chief of detectives.

14:59.198 --> 15:00.900
She wants the Ghost’s
original cases

15:00.900 --> 15:03.369
sent back to the squads
where they first landed

15:03.369 --> 15:06.639
for reevaluation and referral.

15:06.639 --> 15:08.374
The good news is
a lot of cops

15:08.374 --> 15:10.042
will get to close
their old cases.

15:10.042 --> 15:11.811
It’s not hard to ID
the real killer

15:11.811 --> 15:14.247
when the wrong DNA
isn’t muddying the water.

15:14.247 --> 15:17.216
This one was the husband,
this one was the boyfriend.

15:17.216 --> 15:18.618
The boss.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.453
The wicked stepmother.

15:20.453 --> 15:22.221
What about Caroline Gibbs?

15:22.221 --> 15:24.090
We’re still working on that.
The neighbor, Benjamin--

15:24.090 --> 15:25.458
the one I told you about--

15:25.458 --> 15:27.160
he’s coming in
for an interview.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.928
Any other angles we’re pursuing?

15:28.928 --> 15:31.297
We asked the lab
to re-test the shirt cuff

15:31.297 --> 15:32.799
that was found at the scene.

15:32.799 --> 15:35.168
Unfortunately, after
you account for Albert Wu,

15:35.168 --> 15:36.836
there’s no human DNA.

15:36.836 --> 15:39.305
No human DNA?

15:39.305 --> 15:40.907
It appears the theory that
the cuff was bitten off

15:40.907 --> 15:43.075
by one of Caroline’s dogs
is correct.

15:43.075 --> 15:44.811
The remaining DNA was canine.

15:44.811 --> 15:47.680
Sherlock and I are about to go
visit anyone who’s shown up

15:47.680 --> 15:50.616
in an emergency room with a bite
wound since the murder.

15:50.616 --> 15:51.984
Any luck, the dog
got a taste of more

15:51.984 --> 15:53.786
than just the killer’s shirt.

15:55.755 --> 15:57.523
Yeah, that’s me. So what?

15:57.523 --> 15:59.258
So, that’s you yelling
at a lady

15:59.258 --> 16:01.260
who got her skull caved in
a week later.

16:01.260 --> 16:03.696
WATSON: The man
who recorded that

16:03.696 --> 16:06.032
thought the two of you
were sleeping together.

16:06.032 --> 16:07.633
Well, then, he must have
been high, that’s ridiculous.

16:07.633 --> 16:10.102
And, frankly, insulting.
I’m a married man.

16:10.102 --> 16:12.805
So what was the fight about?

16:12.805 --> 16:16.642
Caroline’s dogs.
They never stop barking.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.211
I was working from home
that day.

16:18.211 --> 16:20.112
I went over to ask her
to quiet them down.

16:20.112 --> 16:22.481
I told her I would call the cops
if she didn’t shut ’em up.

16:22.481 --> 16:24.550
We argued, the end.

16:24.550 --> 16:26.319
You think that’s motive
for murder?

16:26.319 --> 16:27.887
People have been killed
for less.

16:27.887 --> 16:30.323
We think that one
of Caroline’s dogs

16:30.323 --> 16:31.490
might have bitten her killer.

16:31.490 --> 16:32.925
Do you mind showing us
your arms?

16:35.661 --> 16:37.864
I had nothing to do
with Caroline’s death.

16:37.864 --> 16:40.299
I wasn’t even home
the night she died.

16:40.299 --> 16:42.201
I was at a business dinner.

16:42.201 --> 16:45.238
Then all you need to do
is write down everyone

16:45.238 --> 16:47.173
who was there, and how
we can get in touch.

16:49.909 --> 16:51.577
You know, if getting mad
at Caroline is enough

16:51.577 --> 16:53.412
to land me in this room,
you’re gonna have to call

16:53.412 --> 16:54.847
the whole neighborhood
down here.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.315
What are you talking about?

16:56.315 --> 16:58.251
She wasn’t exactly
a model citizen.

16:58.251 --> 17:01.654
Barking dogs, strange men coming
and going from her house.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.322
Loud music at all hours.

17:03.322 --> 17:04.891
What do you mean by
"strange men"?

17:04.891 --> 17:08.027
These... punks that are
knocking on her door

17:08.027 --> 17:09.862
at weird hours.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.632
They only stay for a few
minutes, then they leave?

17:14.834 --> 17:16.235
I really have to
spell it out for you?

17:16.235 --> 17:18.437
She was a drug dealer,
obviously.

17:18.437 --> 17:21.173
You ask me,
that’s what got her killed.

17:22.608 --> 17:25.611
Esther Kelton?
My name is Marcus Bell.

17:25.611 --> 17:26.846
I’m a detective
with the NYPD.

17:26.846 --> 17:28.414
This is my colleague,
Mr. Holmes.

17:28.414 --> 17:30.249
Hello.

17:30.249 --> 17:31.717
Would you mind if we
asked you some questions?

17:31.717 --> 17:33.519
Sure. What about?

17:33.519 --> 17:36.355
You visited the ER
three days ago, Mr. Fowler?

17:36.355 --> 17:38.424
We understand you were
attacked by a dog.

17:38.424 --> 17:40.259
Golden retriever.

17:40.259 --> 17:42.194
I was jogging through
Central Park,

17:42.194 --> 17:43.763
he came out of nowhere.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.398
Jumped up and got me
on the arm.

17:45.398 --> 17:48.935
This? That’s nothing.

17:48.935 --> 17:51.370
I-I just got Bingo
two weeks ago.

17:51.370 --> 17:53.272
He’s still a pup.

17:53.272 --> 17:55.241
I was feeding him.
He got overexcited.

17:55.241 --> 17:57.810
I was at a party.
We were playing charades,

17:57.810 --> 18:00.146
and I got Reservoir Dogs.

18:00.146 --> 18:02.748
So I’m crawling around on the
ground barking and everything,

18:02.748 --> 18:05.785
and my friend’s Dalmatian
freaks out and attacks.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.486
Why do you ask?

18:07.486 --> 18:09.555
Why do you guys care about this?

18:09.555 --> 18:12.725
I mean, I don’t want the dog
sent to the pound or anything.

18:12.725 --> 18:15.995
Three nights ago, a woman
was murdered on Staten Island.

18:15.995 --> 18:18.331
We think one of her dogs might
have bitten the killer.

18:18.331 --> 18:19.465
Oh, my.

18:19.465 --> 18:20.633
Would you mind telling us

18:20.633 --> 18:21.767
where you were
three nights ago?

18:21.767 --> 18:23.269
I was at the gym.

18:23.269 --> 18:25.171
A hundred people must have
seen me there.

18:25.171 --> 18:26.906
I play bridge on Monday nights.

18:26.906 --> 18:29.408
Every week, since 1981.

18:29.408 --> 18:31.143
I went to the movies.

18:31.143 --> 18:33.346
I think I still have
the receipt.

18:38.317 --> 18:39.785
Do you own all of
those phones, Mr. Fowler?

18:41.687 --> 18:43.122
Yeah.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.591
Name on the back of
that one says "Mandy."

18:45.591 --> 18:47.860
Yeah, she’s my girlfriend.

18:47.860 --> 18:50.429
If you show us
the other phones,

18:50.429 --> 18:53.132
are we gonna find a Mandy
in any of the contact lists?

18:55.167 --> 18:57.937
Did you steal those phones,
Mr. Fowler?

19:11.617 --> 19:14.020
Well, not the arrest
we were hoping for,

19:14.020 --> 19:16.022
but I guess beggars
can’t be choosers.

19:16.022 --> 19:17.790
Watson says she’s
made some progress

19:17.790 --> 19:19.325
at Caroline Gibbs’ home.

19:19.325 --> 19:21.661
She’s asked us to
go meet her there.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.996
You go, I’ll bring
this knucklehead downtown,

19:23.996 --> 19:25.898
meet up with you.

19:32.338 --> 19:33.673
There you are.

19:33.673 --> 19:37.009
Oh. Any luck with
the dog bite victims?
None.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.177
If he was bitten by a dog,

19:38.177 --> 19:39.178
he didn’t get treated
at a hospital.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.913
You said you found evidence

19:40.913 --> 19:43.683
that Caroline Gibbs was
selling drugs.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.618
Yeah, a pound of it.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.490
Leaves of Grass, indeed.

19:51.490 --> 19:52.558
Caroline’s neighbors said a lot
of strange people came here

19:52.558 --> 19:54.326
to buy drugs.

19:54.326 --> 19:56.362
I was hoping that she left a
list of her customers somewhere,

19:56.362 --> 19:58.664
but I’m starting to think
she was too smart for that.

19:58.664 --> 20:00.066
But it’s worth looking into.

20:00.066 --> 20:01.701
Oh, how’d it go with McNally?

20:01.701 --> 20:03.035
You saw him this morning, right?

20:03.035 --> 20:04.270
Good. I gave him a copy
of your dossier

20:04.270 --> 20:06.272
on the Phoenix shooting.

20:06.272 --> 20:08.641
He was appreciative.
Said they’d look into it.

20:11.110 --> 20:14.113
Did you know that
you have a tell...

20:14.113 --> 20:16.949
when you lie,

20:16.949 --> 20:19.118
but no one else can
see it but me?

20:19.118 --> 20:21.020
Did you partake of any of that?

20:21.020 --> 20:22.121
You lied just now
when you said that

20:22.121 --> 20:24.123
you gave McNally what I found.

20:24.123 --> 20:26.525
Watson...
Just tell me.

20:26.525 --> 20:28.227
All right, I lied.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.562
Why?

20:29.562 --> 20:32.031
Because I don’t want you,
Marcus or the captain

20:32.031 --> 20:34.100
or anyone else that
we care about to be murdered.

20:34.100 --> 20:35.401
What?

20:35.401 --> 20:38.037
McNally has no intention
of dismantling Odin’s operation.

20:38.037 --> 20:41.540
In fact, he’ll do everything
in his power to keep it going.

20:41.540 --> 20:43.476
So he’s a part of it.
How long have you known?

20:43.476 --> 20:45.044
Weeks.

20:45.044 --> 20:48.247
He made his allegiances
quite clear

20:48.247 --> 20:49.915
when he threatened the lives
of everyone in our orbit

20:49.915 --> 20:51.650
if we didn’t drop
our investigation.

20:51.650 --> 20:54.720
Since when do I need to be
shielded from the truth?

20:54.720 --> 20:57.556
I didn’t do it to shield you,
I did it to spare you.

20:57.556 --> 20:59.425
From what?
From having to lie
to everyone else.

20:59.425 --> 21:01.160
Odin is the reason
the captain was shot

21:01.160 --> 21:02.561
and we can’t tell him.

21:02.561 --> 21:04.763
Or Marcus or anyone else,
for that matter.

21:04.763 --> 21:07.600
Knowing a secret of that
magnitude, kno-knowing the truth

21:07.600 --> 21:09.401
about an attack
that almost killed a friend

21:09.401 --> 21:12.438
and keeping silent,
it’s... corrosive.

21:12.438 --> 21:14.640
I want to talk to you more
about this later.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.275
Well, why not now?

21:16.275 --> 21:18.010
Because you’re not the only one
who lied to me today.

21:18.010 --> 21:20.179
Caroline’s neighbor
was upset about an affair,

21:20.179 --> 21:22.381
Just not his own.

21:23.949 --> 21:27.453
Benjamin said he told you
about Caroline selling drugs.

21:27.453 --> 21:30.156
Is that what this is about?
HOLMES: No.

21:30.156 --> 21:32.258
It’s about the affair
you were having.

21:33.859 --> 21:36.095
W-What?

21:36.095 --> 21:37.830
We spoke to an artist friend
of Caroline’s.

21:37.830 --> 21:40.132
He saw your husband
arguing with her last week.

21:40.132 --> 21:42.268
He overheard something
about an affair,

21:42.268 --> 21:44.103
he assumed it was
about Benjamin and Caroline.

21:44.103 --> 21:46.438
But then I found
some long pink hairs

21:46.438 --> 21:49.608
in the bristles of a brush
in her bedroom.

21:49.608 --> 21:51.410
Where were you
the night she was murdered?

21:52.545 --> 21:54.280
Here, at home.

21:54.280 --> 21:56.882
Your husband told us that
he was at a business center.

21:56.882 --> 21:59.385
I didn’t hurt Caroline.

21:59.385 --> 22:00.986
I could never.

22:00.986 --> 22:03.022
I loved her.

22:03.022 --> 22:05.057
HOLMES: I’m afraid that
that is not exculpatory.

22:05.057 --> 22:08.394
2.5 women are murdered every day
by an intimate partner.

22:08.394 --> 22:11.130
So we’re going to have to cover
our statistical bases

22:11.130 --> 22:13.365
with a little more
than your word.

22:13.365 --> 22:14.967
When’s the last
time you saw her?

22:14.967 --> 22:17.336
It was the night she died.

22:17.336 --> 22:20.372
I was doing dishes
in the kitchen.

22:20.372 --> 22:24.843
I saw her out the window,
she had her welding gear on.

22:24.843 --> 22:26.512
I just figured she was working.

22:26.512 --> 22:27.813
What time was that?

22:27.813 --> 22:29.748
Um... 9:00.

22:29.748 --> 22:32.685
On the dot,
actually.

22:32.685 --> 22:34.720
I know this because
my watch beeps

22:34.720 --> 22:36.522
when I have to take
my thyroid pill.

22:36.522 --> 22:39.525
Well, you’re either
mistaken or you’re lying.

22:39.525 --> 22:43.395
Caroline’s time of death
was placed at 8:30.

22:43.395 --> 22:45.397
Around the same time
other neighbors heard

22:45.397 --> 22:46.832
the dogs start barking.

22:46.832 --> 22:49.168
The medical examiner
is rarely off by much

22:49.168 --> 22:50.769
when a body
is found promptly.

22:50.769 --> 22:52.271
And it’s unlikely
she was walking around

22:52.271 --> 22:54.273
after she was murdered.

22:54.273 --> 22:56.041
Maybe it wasn’t her.

22:56.041 --> 22:58.711
You said that she was wearing
her welding gear.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.379
I assume it included a mask?

23:01.513 --> 23:03.582
Yeah, i-it covered her face.

23:03.582 --> 23:05.951
You think the killer
disguised himself as Caroline

23:05.951 --> 23:07.419
to sneak around her property.

23:07.419 --> 23:09.555
I’m sure her social
media probably has

23:09.555 --> 23:11.690
plenty of photos of
her making art, right?

23:11.690 --> 23:13.592
Jeans and a
welding mask

23:13.592 --> 23:15.594
would have been an easy look
to replicate.

23:15.594 --> 23:18.731
So if it wasn’t Caroline
I saw that night,

23:18.731 --> 23:20.699
it was the person
that killed her,

23:20.699 --> 23:22.368
why would they have had her dog?

23:22.368 --> 23:25.437
Her dog?
Ollie, her German Shepherd.

23:25.437 --> 23:27.873
Whoever it was,
they had him on a leash.

23:27.873 --> 23:30.876
The ASPCA removed five dogs
from Caroline’s property

23:30.876 --> 23:32.711
after her body
was discovered.

23:32.711 --> 23:34.780
None of them
was a German Shepherd.

23:34.780 --> 23:36.782
I don’t know what to tell you.

23:36.782 --> 23:38.250
She definitely had one.

23:40.052 --> 23:43.589
Okay. Yeah. Thank you.

23:43.589 --> 23:47.059
The ASPCA has no record
of the dog you described.

23:47.059 --> 23:49.395
This is him, if it helps.

23:49.395 --> 23:51.930
Caroline fostered rescue dogs.

23:51.930 --> 23:53.465
So they were always
coming and going,

23:53.465 --> 23:54.833
but I couldn’t forget Ollie.

23:54.833 --> 23:56.769
Are you sure he hadn’t
outstayed his welcome?

23:56.769 --> 23:58.804
I mean, she fosters animals,
they came and went

23:58.804 --> 24:00.406
with some regularity, no?

24:00.406 --> 24:01.607
There’s six dog bowls here

24:01.607 --> 24:03.175
and only five leashes.

24:03.175 --> 24:04.977
I think he was taken.

24:04.977 --> 24:07.179
We’ve investigated
several possible motives

24:07.179 --> 24:09.915
for Caroline’s murder
and we found each one lacking.

24:09.915 --> 24:13.852
What if it wasn’t her life
the killer wanted...

24:13.852 --> 24:15.187
...but her dog.

24:21.026 --> 24:22.428
BELL:
His name’s Ollie.

24:22.428 --> 24:23.796
Far as Joan and
Sherlock can tell,

24:23.796 --> 24:25.464
no one’s seen him since
Caroline Gibbs’s murder.

24:25.464 --> 24:28.300
Tell me he’s not a suspect.
Actually, we think

24:28.300 --> 24:30.336
he’s the reason the killer
went to her house that night.

24:30.336 --> 24:31.804
He wanted to steal her dog?

24:31.804 --> 24:35.007
Ollie was one of six
Caroline was fostering.

24:35.007 --> 24:37.343
Thing is,
ASPCA only collected five

24:37.343 --> 24:39.144
from her house after her death.

24:39.144 --> 24:41.680
Are German Shepherds
more valuable than I thought?

24:41.680 --> 24:43.282
Pretty sure
this wasn’t about money.

24:43.282 --> 24:45.451
I called around to different
rescue organizations

24:45.451 --> 24:48.020
this morning, found out
Caroline got Ollie from

24:48.020 --> 24:50.990
a place called The Doghauser
about four months ago.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.558
Where was he before that?

24:53.659 --> 24:55.127
Funny you should ask.

24:57.730 --> 24:59.365
He was a police dog?

24:59.365 --> 25:02.134
K-9 unit out
of the 3-6.

25:02.134 --> 25:04.536
Did five years there before
retiring last spring.

25:04.536 --> 25:07.206
Bomb sniffer?
Narcotics.

25:07.206 --> 25:08.874
According to his file,
he was good at it.

25:08.874 --> 25:11.176
Helped out on a bunch
of successful arrests.

25:11.176 --> 25:13.212
His ex-partner’s coming in
to talk to me,

25:13.212 --> 25:16.081
in case you
want to join.

25:16.081 --> 25:18.851
Ollie and I worked together
five years.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.319
Best partner I ever had.

25:22.254 --> 25:24.723
I know how it might sound,
but Ollie’s not just a dog.

25:24.723 --> 25:26.925
He’s... he’s a police officer.

25:26.925 --> 25:28.761
One of us.

25:28.761 --> 25:30.429
You got to get him back.

25:30.429 --> 25:32.498
We’re doing our best.

25:32.498 --> 25:35.667
So I understand Ollie
was retired last year?

25:35.667 --> 25:37.870
Yeah, he got
hip dysplasia.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.705
My girlfriend and I
wanted to adopt him,

25:39.705 --> 25:43.075
but third floor walk-up’s
no good for 100-pound Shepherd

25:43.075 --> 25:44.710
with wonky hips, so...

25:44.710 --> 25:46.078
he went to a rescue group.

25:46.078 --> 25:48.213
Him being taken.

25:48.213 --> 25:50.082
Any chance it’s about you?

25:50.082 --> 25:51.250
Me?

25:51.250 --> 25:52.618
Yeah, you obviously
care about him,

25:52.618 --> 25:54.219
maybe someone took him
to hurt you.

25:54.219 --> 25:55.888
I-I don’t think so.

25:55.888 --> 25:58.123
I mean, you don’t make a lot
of enemies in the K-9 unit.

25:58.123 --> 26:00.192
I’m just the guy
that shows up with a dog

26:00.192 --> 26:02.428
and finds your drugs.
What about Ollie?

26:02.428 --> 26:03.762
He have any enemies?

26:03.762 --> 26:05.097
He’s a dog.

26:05.097 --> 26:08.901
Couple years ago,
the Urabeños cartel in Colombia

26:08.901 --> 26:11.770
put out a $70,000 hit
on a police dog

26:11.770 --> 26:13.572
’cause he kept sniffing out
their shipments.

26:13.572 --> 26:15.908
Okay, but Ollie was retired.

26:15.908 --> 26:17.209
I’m not saying it’s logical.

26:17.209 --> 26:19.111
But cartels hold grudges.

26:19.111 --> 26:20.712
Maybe they were trying
to prove a point

26:20.712 --> 26:22.481
and our vic just got in the way.

26:23.982 --> 26:25.451
Ollie’s specialty
was marijuana.

26:25.451 --> 26:28.053
So most of the guys we collared
were stoners, you know?

26:28.053 --> 26:29.688
Not the most
bloodthirsty of bad guys.

26:31.089 --> 26:33.926
No, no one jumps out.

26:33.926 --> 26:35.961
We didn’t realize
Ollie had a specialty.

26:35.961 --> 26:38.230
Yeah, most of our dogs do.

26:38.230 --> 26:40.165
It’s kind of ironic, huh?

26:40.165 --> 26:44.636
Weed-sniffing dog being fostered
by someone who sells the stuff.

26:44.636 --> 26:46.472
I don’t know
about ironic, but...

26:46.472 --> 26:48.707
it might not be a coincidence.

26:51.176 --> 26:52.811
HOLMES: I thought perhaps
now is a good time

26:52.811 --> 26:54.279
to finish
our conversation.

26:54.279 --> 26:55.914
My handling of
the Odin Reichenbach situation.

26:55.914 --> 26:57.649
I assume you have
more questions.

26:57.649 --> 27:01.086
I don’t really have questions;
I have strong feelings.

27:01.086 --> 27:02.921
And I understand full well
how powerful Odin is.

27:04.756 --> 27:06.525
I mean, I get why
you didn’t tell me

27:06.525 --> 27:08.527
what was going on with
the NSA investigation.

27:08.527 --> 27:11.797
I mean, I don’t love
it, but I get it.

27:11.797 --> 27:13.131
Still, it doesn’t
change the fact

27:13.131 --> 27:14.700
that he’s too
dangerous to ignore.

27:14.700 --> 27:16.702
We’ve got to find some
angle on the guy,

27:16.702 --> 27:18.971
we can’t just just
roll over for him.

27:18.971 --> 27:21.006
You were under the impression
that’s what I’ve done?

27:21.006 --> 27:22.975
Over the last month,

27:22.975 --> 27:26.678
I’ve been attempting
to reach my contacts at SIS.

27:26.678 --> 27:28.113
It’s delicate.

27:28.113 --> 27:31.149
Odin casts a long shadow online,

27:31.149 --> 27:34.953
so I’ve been limited
to analog back channels.

27:34.953 --> 27:38.690
Which is why I wanted
to give you this.

27:38.690 --> 27:41.193
When my message reaches
the appropriate parties,

27:41.193 --> 27:43.896
agents of the Crown will call
that encrypted cell phone.

27:43.896 --> 27:45.397
Why give it to me?

27:45.397 --> 27:47.132
Because I trust you.

27:47.132 --> 27:48.901
Then I want to show
that I’m worthy

27:48.901 --> 27:50.369
of your trust in return.

27:50.369 --> 27:52.871
I lied to you once about Odin.

27:52.871 --> 27:54.506
I won’t do it again.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.275
(cell phone ringing)

27:58.377 --> 28:00.178
(phone clicks)

28:00.178 --> 28:02.481
Marcus, you have us both.

28:02.481 --> 28:03.815
Couple things.

28:03.815 --> 28:05.484
The lab says the marijuana
you found

28:05.484 --> 28:06.818
at Caroline Gibbs’s house

28:06.818 --> 28:09.087
is from a particular
sativa strain.

28:09.087 --> 28:11.089
Last time they saw
the stuff it came from

28:11.089 --> 28:13.392
a street rip Vice did
out on Staten Island.

28:13.392 --> 28:15.027
Near where Caroline lived?

28:15.027 --> 28:17.529
Yeah, a few low-level dealers
from a Mexican gang

28:17.529 --> 28:18.764
were holding the stuff.

28:18.764 --> 28:20.365
Los Santiagos.

28:20.365 --> 28:21.833
Other thing I thought
you should know

28:21.833 --> 28:24.403
is that Ollie the police dog
had a specialty.

28:24.403 --> 28:26.572
He was great at sniffing out
marijuana.

28:26.572 --> 28:29.508
Perhaps we should introduce
ourselves to Los Santiagos.

28:29.508 --> 28:31.276
If they were
Caroline’s suppliers,

28:31.276 --> 28:33.445
perhaps they knew
she was fostering a police dog.

28:33.445 --> 28:35.581
Yeah, crossed my mind, too,
but you really think

28:35.581 --> 28:37.783
she’s talking to her suppliers
about her dogs?

28:37.783 --> 28:39.217
WATSON:
I don’t know.

28:39.217 --> 28:41.720
Pet owners will talk
to anybody about their pets.

28:41.720 --> 28:44.222
Our mailman knows
Clyde’s life story.

28:44.222 --> 28:46.925
Say the Santiagos
did know about Ollie.

28:46.925 --> 28:48.527
What would they want with him?

28:48.527 --> 28:49.761
WATSON:
Maybe they wanted to use him

28:49.761 --> 28:51.597
to test their smuggling methods.

28:51.597 --> 28:54.566
Ollie would be a good canary
in the cannabis coalmine.

28:54.566 --> 28:57.703
Those in the marijuana business
are constantly experimenting

28:57.703 --> 29:00.138
with new packing materials,
masking agents,

29:00.138 --> 29:02.241
even innovations in the agronomy
of the plant itself.

29:03.875 --> 29:05.310
If Ollie sniffed it out,
then they would

29:05.310 --> 29:06.612
go back to the drawing board.

29:06.612 --> 29:08.046
If he can’t,

29:08.046 --> 29:09.982
they have a police-proof way
of moving their product.

29:09.982 --> 29:11.783
Well, the leader
of the New York Santiagos

29:11.783 --> 29:13.719
is a guy named Enrique Ruiz.

29:13.719 --> 29:16.788
Narcotics tells me he works
out of an OTB he owns.

29:16.788 --> 29:19.791
Feel like joining me
for a visit?

29:19.791 --> 29:22.561
(man speaking Spanish)

29:22.561 --> 29:24.496
(mutters in Spanish)

29:25.597 --> 29:27.432
We’d like to speak
to Enrique Ruiz.

29:27.432 --> 29:29.368
(continues
speaking Spanish)

29:30.502 --> 29:32.104
Enrique Ruiz,

29:32.104 --> 29:34.673
head of New York operations
for the Santiago Cartel.

29:34.673 --> 29:37.576
We know he’s here.
Lo siento, no hablo inglés.

29:37.576 --> 29:39.511
Estás ocupado.
No hay problema.

29:39.511 --> 29:40.846
Encontraré a Enrique yo solo.

29:40.846 --> 29:42.147
Hey, hey.

29:42.147 --> 29:43.582
You can’t go back there.

29:43.582 --> 29:45.083
Just ’cause you’re police
doesn’t mean

29:45.083 --> 29:46.685
you can do whatever you want.
BELL:
That’s true.

29:46.685 --> 29:49.187
But, since you reek of weed,

29:49.187 --> 29:51.023
and you just lied
to a police officer

29:51.023 --> 29:52.591
about being able
to speak English,

29:52.591 --> 29:54.593
one thing I can do
is search you.

29:54.593 --> 29:56.328
So either show me
your pockets

29:56.328 --> 29:58.397
or show me
Enrique Ruiz.

30:00.198 --> 30:01.867
Down the stairs,
second door on the left.

30:10.275 --> 30:12.611
(speaking Spanish, laughing)

30:15.147 --> 30:17.082
Looking for Enrique Ruiz.

30:18.150 --> 30:20.318
Who the hell are you?

30:20.318 --> 30:21.887
Marcus Bell, NYPD.
These are my associates,

30:21.887 --> 30:23.555
Ms. Watson,
Mr. Holmes.

30:23.555 --> 30:24.890
Whatever it was,

30:24.890 --> 30:26.658
I didn’t do it.

30:26.658 --> 30:29.161
BELL: Two days ago,
a woman named Caroline Gibbs

30:29.161 --> 30:31.496
was murdered
and a retired police dog

30:31.496 --> 30:33.165
was stolen
from her property.

30:33.165 --> 30:34.866
When we searched the house,
we found marijuana

30:34.866 --> 30:38.036
that matches a strain of sativa
sold by you.

30:38.036 --> 30:41.006
That’s very interesting,
but I don’t sell weed.

30:41.006 --> 30:42.708
I own an OTB.

30:42.708 --> 30:44.876
That said,

30:44.876 --> 30:46.545
if I did sell weed,

30:46.545 --> 30:48.580
I bet it would be the best.

30:48.580 --> 30:50.849
A lot of people would
probably have it.

30:50.849 --> 30:53.085
Maybe even your dead lady.

30:53.085 --> 30:54.986
Well, we think she sold for you.

30:54.986 --> 30:57.089
We also think she made
the mistake of telling you

30:57.089 --> 30:58.757
or one of your men
that she’d adopted

30:58.757 --> 31:00.225
a former police dog
that used to specialize

31:00.225 --> 31:01.860
in detecting marijuana.

31:01.860 --> 31:06.198
So I didn’t just kill this lady,
I stole her pooch?

31:06.198 --> 31:07.466
You tell us.

31:10.402 --> 31:11.837
(banging on wall)

31:11.837 --> 31:14.740
Hey. Let’s everyone
just stay calm.

31:14.740 --> 31:17.576
Of course. Very calm.

31:17.576 --> 31:19.511
Looking for me?

31:19.511 --> 31:21.847
This is my attorney,
Danielle Olivera.

31:21.847 --> 31:24.249
They’re with the police.

31:24.249 --> 31:27.252
(chuckles) Your attorney just
happened to be in the back room

31:27.252 --> 31:28.954
of the nerve center

31:28.954 --> 31:30.088
of your drug
dealing operation?

31:30.088 --> 31:31.123
DANIELLE: This isn’t
a nerve center,

31:31.123 --> 31:32.858
it’s an OTB.

31:32.858 --> 31:34.359
And there’s no back room
behind that wall,

31:34.359 --> 31:35.927
just my legal offices.

31:35.927 --> 31:38.230
Mr. Ruiz leases space
to me at a bargain rate,

31:38.230 --> 31:40.565
and I provide free
legal services in exchange.

31:40.565 --> 31:43.301
They think I killed some lady
and kidnapped her dog.

31:43.301 --> 31:46.905
I see. Have you said everything
you want to say to them?

31:46.905 --> 31:48.707
I have.

31:48.707 --> 31:50.842
Do you have a warrant?

31:52.410 --> 31:55.981
Then please,
show yourselves out.

31:57.916 --> 32:00.485
HOLMES: Well, I just
heard from Marcus.

32:00.485 --> 32:03.555
There’s no way to get a warrant
to search the Santiagos’ OTB

32:03.555 --> 32:07.259
without more evidence linking
them to Caroline Gibbs’s murder.

32:07.259 --> 32:08.593
Apparently, their lawyer,
Ms. Olivera,

32:08.593 --> 32:10.328
has won her fair share
of skirmishes

32:10.328 --> 32:12.164
with the D.A.’s office,
and they’re afraid of her.

32:12.164 --> 32:14.266
Well, I think I might’ve
found something

32:14.266 --> 32:16.134
that will help them turn
the tables. I took this photo

32:16.134 --> 32:17.969
in the back office at the OTB.

32:17.969 --> 32:20.238
The guys in the gang
were distracted, and you were

32:20.238 --> 32:22.274
talking to Enrique
and his lawyer.

32:22.274 --> 32:23.842
At first, I thought
I’d just gotten pictures

32:23.842 --> 32:26.678
of some basic bookie stuff,
but check this out.

32:29.581 --> 32:31.917
I find sports gambling
as boring as the stock market.

32:31.917 --> 32:33.919
Never developed
a taste for it.

32:33.919 --> 32:35.453
Well, it kind of looks
like a line for a game

32:35.453 --> 32:37.422
between Boston and Milwaukee.

32:37.422 --> 32:39.457
The thing is, those two cities
aren’t playing each other

32:39.457 --> 32:42.828
in any major sport
for another three months.

32:42.828 --> 32:44.663
You think the Santiagos
are not that forward-thinking?

32:44.663 --> 32:47.132
It would be crazy
to set odds this far ahead.

32:47.132 --> 32:49.034
I mean, as a native New Yorker,
it hurts to say,

32:49.034 --> 32:51.603
but Boston has great teams
pretty much across the board.

32:51.603 --> 32:53.638
I can’t think of a single game
where one of their teams

32:53.638 --> 32:56.842
would be favored to lose
to Milwaukee at those odds.

32:56.842 --> 32:58.210
So what are we looking at?

32:58.210 --> 32:59.778
I think it’s a
shipping schedule.

32:59.778 --> 33:02.681
I mean, now that marijuana is
legal in some parts of the U.S.,

33:02.681 --> 33:05.217
a lot more of it is being
smuggled state to state,

33:05.217 --> 33:07.018
sometimes by train.

33:07.018 --> 33:09.654
Boston to Milwaukee takes
about 25 hours by rail,

33:09.654 --> 33:11.189
so if you left at 11:24,
you would arrive

33:11.189 --> 33:13.191
at 12:09 the next day.

33:13.191 --> 33:15.026
That must be what
the plus-one is.

33:15.026 --> 33:16.461
And I’m guessing the 300
is a reference

33:16.461 --> 33:18.363
to shipment size, 300 pounds?

33:18.363 --> 33:20.632
Yeah. I don’t see any dates.
There aren’t any.

33:20.632 --> 33:22.868
But if you cross-reference
the times

33:22.868 --> 33:24.502
against a commercial
rail schedule,

33:24.502 --> 33:26.071
it’s not hard to pin them down.

33:26.071 --> 33:27.839
I was thinking, if
the police could seize

33:27.839 --> 33:30.342
one of the gang’s shipments,
we could use it as leverage

33:30.342 --> 33:31.743
to pry the truth out of them.

33:31.743 --> 33:33.545
Unfortunately,
we just missed this train.

33:33.545 --> 33:36.348
It came through New York
for a fuel stop an hour ago.

33:36.348 --> 33:39.417
But there is another shipment
coming in early next week.

33:39.417 --> 33:41.052
(phone ringing)

33:41.052 --> 33:42.754
Hey, Marcus.
We’ve got good news.

33:42.754 --> 33:45.690
BELL: Yeah? So do I.
Ollie just turned up.

33:45.690 --> 33:47.092
You’re kidding. Where?

33:47.092 --> 33:48.460
Would you believe a train yard?

33:50.395 --> 33:53.398
Yard manager showed up
for work an hour ago

33:53.398 --> 33:56.334
and found the security guard
lying here, unconscious.

33:56.334 --> 33:58.737
Someone attacked him?

33:58.737 --> 34:00.171
Hit him with a Taser.

34:00.171 --> 34:01.573
Paramedics said
he’s gonna be fine,

34:01.573 --> 34:04.376
they took him
to the hospital just to be safe.

34:04.376 --> 34:06.378
First officers on the scene
halted all rail traffic,

34:06.378 --> 34:08.947
had a look around.
They found this guy.

34:08.947 --> 34:10.682
Saw his name on his collar,
recognized it

34:10.682 --> 34:13.752
from the Finest Message
we put out, and called it in.

34:13.752 --> 34:17.022
Was the guard able to describe
the person who Tased him?

34:17.022 --> 34:18.256
No. Apparently,
he got zapped from behind

34:18.256 --> 34:19.758
while he was making his rounds.

34:19.758 --> 34:20.759
Whatever happened,

34:20.759 --> 34:22.928
he didn’t see or hear anything.

34:22.928 --> 34:24.562
Someone stole a shipment
of the Santiagos’ marijuana.

34:26.765 --> 34:29.734
The smugglers had
their stash in here,

34:29.734 --> 34:32.871
the one Watson flagged
for a 12:09 arrival,

34:32.871 --> 34:35.407
hidden behind a false wall

34:35.407 --> 34:36.908
and a bunch of
packing boxes.

34:36.908 --> 34:39.311
That’s a big compartment.

34:39.311 --> 34:40.912
So if I’m right about
the code they were using,

34:40.912 --> 34:42.447
it was holding 300 pounds
of marijuana.

34:42.447 --> 34:45.717
That much marijuana
would have a street value

34:45.717 --> 34:46.818
of a million dollars, at least.

34:46.818 --> 34:48.286
But you’re sure it was stolen?

34:48.286 --> 34:50.555
Could’ve just been
the cartel guys, right?

34:50.555 --> 34:51.957
Los Santiagos
wouldn’t need a drug dog

34:51.957 --> 34:53.258
to find their own product.

34:53.258 --> 34:54.926
They’d know where it was.

34:54.926 --> 34:56.328
WATSON: That’s why
Ollie was taken.

34:56.328 --> 34:58.296
To help someone
pull off a heist.

34:58.296 --> 35:00.298
They knew the drugs were
in one of these cars,

35:00.298 --> 35:01.633
they just didn’t know which one.

35:01.633 --> 35:02.968
Say you’re right.

35:02.968 --> 35:04.970
The person who killed
Caroline Gibbs

35:04.970 --> 35:07.973
would have a seven-figure score
and a serious head start.

35:07.973 --> 35:09.240
So, unless Ollie over there

35:09.240 --> 35:11.142
can give us
a description,

35:11.142 --> 35:13.378
I’d say we’ve got a lot
of ground to make up.

35:20.118 --> 35:21.620
WATSON: Hey. I need your
opinion on something.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.321
Do you think anyone would
mistake Bob for you

35:23.321 --> 35:25.190
if he was dressed like this?

35:25.190 --> 35:27.425
I imagine they’d think
the same thing I’m thinking.

35:27.425 --> 35:29.160
There’s no species
of Anthophila known

35:29.160 --> 35:30.829
to attack inanimate
rubber dummies.

35:30.829 --> 35:32.430
No, I mean,
there’s no chance they’d think

35:32.430 --> 35:34.165
it was you, right?
No, Watson,

35:34.165 --> 35:36.167
I don’t imagine they would.
I wouldn’t, either,

35:36.167 --> 35:38.436
even though I would recognize
this outfit as yours.

35:38.436 --> 35:39.938
I mean, he’s broader,
his pecs are more pronounced.

35:39.938 --> 35:42.007
I’m not sure
what you’re getting at.

35:42.007 --> 35:43.875
I was just thinking
about Diana Long.

35:43.875 --> 35:45.877
So the night
that Caroline was murdered,

35:45.877 --> 35:47.946
Diana saw someone
dressed just like her.

35:47.946 --> 35:49.948
And if we’re right,
and that was her killer,

35:49.948 --> 35:51.182
their dimensions would have
to be similar

35:51.182 --> 35:53.284
to Caroline’s.
It was night.

35:53.284 --> 35:54.686
The killer
was seen from a distance.

35:54.686 --> 35:56.688
Sure, but it wasn’t
just some random passerby.

35:56.688 --> 35:59.290
It was Diana.
She and Caroline were intimate.

35:59.290 --> 36:02.127
She knew Caroline’s body.
She would’ve
noticed some

36:02.127 --> 36:03.862
obvious discrepancy.
We’ve been looking
at everyone

36:03.862 --> 36:06.498
who knew about
the cartel’s shipment schedule.

36:06.498 --> 36:09.234
I think we can narrow our scope
and eliminate anyone

36:09.234 --> 36:11.169
who wasn’t at least
Caroline’s size.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.171
So what about Danielle Olivera?

36:13.171 --> 36:16.374
I mean, she has the same
build as Caroline’s.

36:16.374 --> 36:17.842
Since she works for the
Santiagos, she probably knows

36:17.842 --> 36:19.044
their shipping schedule.

36:19.044 --> 36:21.513
Maybe she double-crossed them.

36:21.513 --> 36:23.148
What is it?

36:23.148 --> 36:25.650
That bookcase.
I’ve seen it somewhere before.

36:25.650 --> 36:27.152
Where?

36:27.152 --> 36:30.822
If I’m not mistaken,
at the home of our killer.

36:30.822 --> 36:32.524
You again.

36:32.524 --> 36:34.392
What’d I do now?

36:34.392 --> 36:37.362
A lot, actually.
Murder, theft of a dog.

36:37.362 --> 36:39.197
Pretty sure you’re
also in possession

36:39.197 --> 36:41.433
of about 300 pounds
of marijuana.

36:41.433 --> 36:43.334
Just ’cause I pled guilty
to swiping some phones

36:43.334 --> 36:46.071
doesn’t mean you can pin every
random crime in the world on me.

36:46.071 --> 36:48.440
You’re right. Not
without evidence.

36:48.440 --> 36:50.442
That’s what the warrant’s for.

36:50.442 --> 36:53.912
Seriously?
What the hell is this about?

36:53.912 --> 36:56.114
WATSON: You stole
a shipment of marijuana

36:56.114 --> 36:57.549
from the Santiago cartel.

36:57.549 --> 36:59.050
We know you know the name.

36:59.050 --> 37:00.719
Your sister is one
of their lawyers.

37:00.719 --> 37:03.421
My sister?
HOLMES:
Danielle Olivera.

37:03.421 --> 37:06.458
Of course, she was Danielle
Fowler before she got married.

37:06.458 --> 37:09.194
I began to suspect a family
connection when I saw

37:09.194 --> 37:11.563
this bookcase in the back
of her professional headshot.

37:11.563 --> 37:13.131
It’s the same as that one there.

37:14.766 --> 37:16.701
We were just
at Danielle’s office.

37:16.701 --> 37:18.870
She’s got
all new furniture now.

37:18.870 --> 37:20.271
She said that she gave you
all the old furniture

37:20.271 --> 37:21.873
after the upgrade.

37:21.873 --> 37:24.576
She told us that you went
and picked it all up yourself.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.478
Yeah. So what?

37:26.478 --> 37:28.947
You think that’s proof
of something?

37:28.947 --> 37:30.782
No, but it might explain
how you knew the Santiagos

37:30.782 --> 37:33.218
had a big shipment
of pot coming in

37:33.218 --> 37:34.452
on a freight train
yesterday.

37:34.452 --> 37:35.587
You knew what time the
train would arrive,

37:35.587 --> 37:37.222
but you didn’t know which car

37:37.222 --> 37:38.990
the weed would be in.

37:38.990 --> 37:42.260
So you abducted Ollie,
a dog with a nose for cannabis.

37:42.260 --> 37:45.263
WATSON: We know you heard
about him from her, too.

37:45.263 --> 37:46.631
She was pretty cooperative
once we told her

37:46.631 --> 37:48.733
what we thought you’d done.

37:48.733 --> 37:51.569
She said she’d never steal from
the cartel. She’s not suicidal.

37:51.569 --> 37:53.138
So we believed her when she said

37:53.138 --> 37:55.106
that Caroline Gibbs
had mentioned Ollie

37:55.106 --> 37:56.908
to some of the guys
in the gang.

37:56.908 --> 37:58.943
They thought it was pretty
funny, a pot dealer

37:58.943 --> 38:02.080
taking care of a
pot-sniffing dog, but you,

38:02.080 --> 38:03.748
you saw
an opportunity.

38:03.748 --> 38:06.451
"Gibbs." That’s the woman
you were asking me about

38:06.451 --> 38:08.653
the other day, right?

38:08.653 --> 38:12.190
I told you, I was at the movies
the night she was killed.

38:12.190 --> 38:13.625
Yeah. You did go to the movies,

38:13.625 --> 38:15.160
then you walked
right back out again.

38:15.160 --> 38:17.428
Security cameras show
you leaving the theater

38:17.428 --> 38:19.264
five minutes
after the movie started.

38:19.264 --> 38:22.934
No. No, just
’cause I didn’t see a movie

38:22.934 --> 38:24.536
doesn’t mean I killed someone.

38:24.536 --> 38:26.604
(Ollie barking)

38:26.604 --> 38:28.473
That’s Ollie.

38:28.473 --> 38:30.041
I wonder what he’s found.

38:32.277 --> 38:34.946
(indistinct chatter)

38:34.946 --> 38:37.115
Whew.

38:38.983 --> 38:42.587
That’s a lot of
weed, Mr. Fowler.

38:44.522 --> 38:46.491
Good boy, Ollie.

38:46.491 --> 38:48.560
He really is

38:48.560 --> 38:50.461
a magnificent animal, isn’t he?

39:04.042 --> 39:06.844
ODIN: I see Dr. Maynard
is back on the threat list?

39:06.844 --> 39:08.046
ANTONIA:
Yeah.

39:08.046 --> 39:10.048
It’s not looking
good in Atlanta.

39:10.048 --> 39:12.584
Is he still making noise
about shooting up his office?

39:12.584 --> 39:14.819
He’s performed three
firearms-related searches

39:14.819 --> 39:17.088
in the last week, and he
sent his lawyer an e-mail

39:17.088 --> 39:19.591
about scheduling a meeting
to update his will.

College student.

39:29.701 --> 39:32.270
The other girls in her dorm
are still bullying her.

39:32.270 --> 39:33.838
E-mails to her
sister make it sound

39:33.838 --> 39:35.707
like she’s close
to breaking.

39:35.707 --> 39:37.909
Has she taken
any concrete steps?

40:04.469 --> 40:07.038
Phoenix. Parker Landis.

40:07.038 --> 40:08.940
Joan Watson has
been poking around.

40:08.940 --> 40:11.242
Has she?

40:11.242 --> 40:14.078
She reached out to the Maricopa
County Sheriff’s Office.

40:14.078 --> 40:16.581
I’m pretty sure
she suspects.

40:16.581 --> 40:20.218
Would you like me to...
No.

40:20.218 --> 40:23.554
No. I think I’ll handle
this one myself.
