01:16.692 --> 01:17.777
MAN: (ON RADIO)
The President doesn't care

01:17.902 --> 01:19.029
about the Hispanic plight.

01:19.154 --> 01:21.865
He doesn't care
about poor Mexicans...

01:42.886 --> 01:45.722
Well, you didn't miss much, if
it makes you feel any better.

01:45.847 --> 01:47.155
Except movie night.

01:47.275 --> 01:49.726
We got Joe Versus the Volcano.
That was pretty good.

01:49.851 --> 01:51.895
And we got meatloaf twice.

01:52.229 --> 01:54.565
Personally,
I think it should be baked,

01:54.731 --> 01:57.067
and here they steam it
so it gets all pasty.

01:57.150 --> 01:59.319
Do not tell Red I said that.

01:59.403 --> 02:02.739
I mean, she knows, but she got
feelings just like everybody else.

02:03.407 --> 02:05.409
You know those good mashed
potatoes that Red makes,

02:05.534 --> 02:06.826
from the real
potatoes and not the box?

02:06.910 --> 02:07.911
Yeah.

02:08.036 --> 02:11.164
Maybe you could ask about getting
some of that served up tonight.

02:11.456 --> 02:12.499
You her girl.

02:13.041 --> 02:15.252
Well, she works up the menus
a week in advance, so...

02:16.253 --> 02:18.796
Think about what
I've been through.

02:21.592 --> 02:23.260
Can't promise anything.

02:36.398 --> 02:41.445
Twenty-six, 27, 28, 29, 30! Ha-ha!
Who's the big talker now?

02:41.570 --> 02:42.738
(MUFFLED) You were
counting too fast!

02:42.820 --> 02:44.864
Bullshit, Vause.
I told you, it can't be done.

02:44.948 --> 02:46.658
Six saltines in 30 seconds?

02:46.782 --> 02:47.783
(SPITS)

02:48.076 --> 02:49.286
(LAUGHING)

02:49.411 --> 02:54.625
You are a disgusting animal.
Okay? What the fuck?

02:54.750 --> 02:57.919
I mean, which is a quality
I greatly admire in a person.

02:58.002 --> 02:59.546
You're in touch
with your primal self.

03:00.922 --> 03:05.135
Yeah, well, my primal self cannot
resist a dare, apparently.

03:05.801 --> 03:09.514
Which is also how I ended up
with three broken toes

03:09.640 --> 03:11.433
and, briefly, chlamydia.

03:12.350 --> 03:13.477
And in prison.

03:13.602 --> 03:16.020
Well, that wasn't so much
a dare, as it was a deal.

03:18.523 --> 03:21.318
MAN ON PA: Officer Webster,
pick up extension 414.

03:28.492 --> 03:31.328
Hey, get over here.
You're missing a moment.

03:31.453 --> 03:33.664
MAN ON PA: Visitation will be
ending in five minutes.

03:35.915 --> 03:37.626
God, SHU must really suck ass.

03:37.709 --> 03:38.876
Man, she was in
there for two weeks.

03:39.002 --> 03:39.961
I've taken shits
longer than that.

03:40.044 --> 03:41.129
(CHUCKLING)

03:44.299 --> 03:47.218
Hey, Kate Winslet.
See any icebergs?

03:47.344 --> 03:48.345
(SCOFFS)

03:50.430 --> 03:51.807
GIRL:
They're back again, Janae.

03:55.935 --> 03:57.895
Cut that out!

04:00.440 --> 04:01.566
Boys chase girls!

04:01.692 --> 04:03.151
Whatcha gonna do
if you catch us?

04:03.318 --> 04:04.986
Only one way to find out.

04:05.236 --> 04:06.655
(SCOFFS)
Go back to your mama.

04:06.863 --> 04:08.615
GIRLS: Ooh...

04:24.506 --> 04:27.342
Janae! Quit showing off!

04:51.616 --> 04:54.745
Good morning. Welcome.

04:54.870 --> 04:56.663
Hey!
HEALY: Ladies of the WAC.

04:56.747 --> 04:59.207
Are you taking us
to prom or something?

04:59.290 --> 05:00.411
Just close the door, please.

05:04.087 --> 05:05.422
Thank you.

05:07.382 --> 05:08.383
All right.

05:09.760 --> 05:13.430
Now, a small token
of my esteem.

05:14.013 --> 05:17.100
Dang, Healy.
That's proper!

05:17.768 --> 05:19.686
(HEALY CHUCKLING)
Oh!

05:20.186 --> 05:21.605
Now you talk
about this outside,

05:21.730 --> 05:23.147
you never see bear claws again.

05:23.273 --> 05:25.817
Silencio, Mr. Healy. We're
gonna be like Red's lady.

05:25.942 --> 05:27.068
What's her name?
The one that don't talk?

05:27.151 --> 05:28.403
Norma.

05:28.528 --> 05:29.780
We gonna be like four Normas.

05:30.906 --> 05:32.824
HEALY: All right, now,
business,

05:32.948 --> 05:37.621
i.e. if you will, the concerns
of your fellow inmates.

05:37.953 --> 05:43.167
Mr. Healy, the pillow that we get
for sleeping is thin like paper.

05:43.293 --> 05:47.046
Sometimes, yo necessito two pillows.
For ergonomics.

05:47.130 --> 05:48.799
A second pillow?
Write it down.

05:49.132 --> 05:53.804
Okay, first of all, the hot sauce
in the commissary is bullshit.

05:53.887 --> 05:56.640
We want that Thailand sauce, the
one with the rooster on it.

05:57.307 --> 05:58.266
Rooster sauce.

05:58.349 --> 06:00.477
And second of all,
ain't no reason we can't

06:00.644 --> 06:02.771
get Fifty Shades of
Grey in the library!

06:02.896 --> 06:04.731
We talked about this,
Jefferson.

06:04.856 --> 06:06.691
Fed's not gonna
subsidize erotica.

06:07.651 --> 06:09.277
I've got a copy.

06:09.527 --> 06:10.904
I've got one, too.

06:12.572 --> 06:14.324
Fifty Shade.

06:15.325 --> 06:18.994
I withdraw my request. But Maria's
straight up about the pillows.

06:19.454 --> 06:20.996
Pillows again. Chapman.

06:23.207 --> 06:24.835
You're done?

06:24.918 --> 06:26.419
Far as I know.

06:27.253 --> 06:28.296
Okay.

06:29.965 --> 06:32.717
The thing is, I think
that a few basic changes

06:32.843 --> 06:35.637
could drastically
improve the quality of life.

06:36.220 --> 06:40.851
Like clinic hours every week
for preventative health care.

06:41.142 --> 06:42.477
And re-opening the track.

06:43.436 --> 06:45.522
And maybe legal counseling.

06:47.190 --> 06:48.232
And the GED program.

06:49.108 --> 06:53.070
Now, I understand that there's a
mold situation in the classroom,

06:53.196 --> 06:54.698
but this needs to be addressed.

06:54.865 --> 06:56.992
The inmates down the hill,
they get classes,

06:57.116 --> 06:59.243
and they are not
getting out any time soon.

06:59.828 --> 07:01.538
We are here for shorter stays.

07:01.872 --> 07:04.749
We should be learning
to improve ourselves,

07:04.875 --> 07:06.376
as students

07:06.543 --> 07:09.713
or even teachers.

07:10.714 --> 07:13.633
Something's telling me
she has a teacher in mind.

07:13.717 --> 07:15.051
(BOTH LAUGHING)

07:15.802 --> 07:16.803
Chang, you're up.

07:16.887 --> 07:18.889
Okay, Mr. Healy. Okay.

07:25.395 --> 07:26.938
Lay it on me, Chang.

07:27.063 --> 07:28.314
Okay.

07:33.403 --> 07:34.571
Good.

07:34.696 --> 07:36.537
We got a good list going here,
some good ideas.

07:36.573 --> 07:37.824
Now, the problem as I see it...

07:37.949 --> 07:39.200
No, sir, I really think that...

07:39.283 --> 07:41.912
...is that we have
a budget situation.

07:42.037 --> 07:44.414
Now, I can do my best,

07:45.248 --> 07:48.251
but it's gonna be hard for me
to do all these things

07:48.376 --> 07:51.212
and still be able to bring donuts
to our meetings every month.

07:56.092 --> 07:57.176
And coffee.

07:58.720 --> 08:00.597
Well, we tried.

08:04.768 --> 08:05.769
(CHUCKLING)

08:05.852 --> 08:07.103
What just happened?

08:07.186 --> 08:08.521
You were there.

08:09.105 --> 08:10.690
We finally get an opportunity

08:10.815 --> 08:12.358
to make some improvements
around here and...

08:12.442 --> 08:14.193
Don't be gettin' all Amistad
on me, Chapman.

08:14.277 --> 08:16.446
Healy look like he
gunning for change?

08:16.529 --> 08:18.782
Okay, but what about your
campaign promises?

08:18.865 --> 08:20.145
Everyone say
shit to get elected.

08:20.241 --> 08:21.451
You ain't actually gotta do it.

08:21.576 --> 08:23.202
That's politics.

08:23.536 --> 08:25.663
I got a disciplinary
board hearing this week,

08:25.789 --> 08:29.084
which, if they don't take away
my good time, I go home.

08:29.584 --> 08:32.003
Healy said he would write
a letter vouching for me.

08:32.629 --> 08:34.297
I ain't looking to make waves.

08:34.380 --> 08:37.341
Glassy water. Smooth sailin'
right on out of here.

08:38.342 --> 08:42.847
So this whole WAC
thing is basically bullshit.

08:44.348 --> 08:45.976
Just take the donuts, girl.

08:50.814 --> 08:52.231
PENNSATUCKY:
Can you believe her?

08:52.315 --> 08:55.192
That college bitch thinks
she can come up in here

08:55.318 --> 08:57.487
and take charge of
shit with her nice teeth

08:57.570 --> 08:59.739
and her pinky
stuck up in the air.

08:59.823 --> 09:01.324
She's got a surprise coming.

09:01.866 --> 09:03.159
Is it a pony?

09:03.952 --> 09:05.745
Just shut your trap, Lurch.

09:05.829 --> 09:08.205
Nobody cares what's comin'
outta them slit lickin' lips.

09:12.335 --> 09:13.920
Did you vote for her?
No.

09:14.045 --> 09:15.672
Did you vote for her?

09:15.797 --> 09:18.215
Who voted for that bitch,
raise your hand! Raise it.

09:19.550 --> 09:20.551
That's what I thought.

09:20.677 --> 09:24.681
Some Garden-of-Gethsemane
shit up in here, y'all.

09:24.848 --> 09:30.478
Chapman is a Judas Iscariot, cozied
on up to the High Priest Healy.

09:30.561 --> 09:32.022
And he throws out my vote.

09:32.105 --> 09:34.774
My votes that
were bestowed upon me

09:34.899 --> 09:37.568
from my Lord,
and gives her all the silver?

09:39.320 --> 09:42.699
So in this analogy,
you're Jesus Christ?

09:43.282 --> 09:45.035
I've been betrayed.

10:25.742 --> 10:28.036
Oh, gosh! Oh, no, no.

10:28.578 --> 10:30.413
(BANGING ON DOOR)
Uh...

10:32.040 --> 10:36.920
Gonna be a while. I'm a little
backed up in here. Sorry.

10:37.128 --> 10:38.171
(BANG ON DOOR)

10:51.684 --> 10:54.020
We were starting to
think you deserted us.

10:56.522 --> 11:01.485
I tried making that coconut cake myself.
Nicky called it "coco-not."

11:01.611 --> 11:02.612
(CHUCKLES)

11:02.695 --> 11:04.948
What pain did you bring down
on her for that?

11:05.073 --> 11:09.326
She was right.
Your cake is inimitable.

11:11.579 --> 11:15.208
Norma got me an improve-your-vocabulary
book out of the library.

11:15.290 --> 11:18.461
You got to keep the brain
cells working, or they die.

11:18.962 --> 11:21.798
To be honest, there's a few things
I wouldn't mind forgetting.

11:22.799 --> 11:24.299
Norma saw you in the library,

11:25.760 --> 11:28.805
bent over a law book like a
boy hiding a titty magazine.

11:29.346 --> 11:31.557
I got interests
beyond coconut cake.

11:31.849 --> 11:34.144
So does every idiot in here.

11:35.061 --> 11:36.479
Where's my Mexican vanilla?

11:37.312 --> 11:38.313
Oh.

11:44.612 --> 11:48.616
Everything off the books
lives like Anne Frank now.

12:02.880 --> 12:04.339
Seems like a lot of trouble.

12:05.258 --> 12:08.845
You get too comfortable,
people take advantage.

12:11.181 --> 12:12.515
You got it under control?

12:13.891 --> 12:16.519
Don't go looking for miracles,
Claudette.

12:17.187 --> 12:20.023
You and me, we figured out
how to do time.

12:22.650 --> 12:23.651
(GRUNTING)

12:23.734 --> 12:27.655
Well, at least it's
better than SHU, right?

12:29.157 --> 12:32.409
I mean, the isolation
must just be terrible.

12:33.119 --> 12:34.204
Or not.

12:34.287 --> 12:35.913
I've never been to SHU.

12:36.622 --> 12:38.666
I've read that it can be
very loud down there,

12:38.749 --> 12:41.044
with people yelling
at each other all the time?

12:43.504 --> 12:45.173
When I said that
I'd never been to SHU,

12:45.298 --> 12:47.008
did that make me
sound like an asshole?

12:47.133 --> 12:48.343
Because obviously I didn't...

12:48.425 --> 12:50.053
Fuck, Chapman.

12:54.598 --> 12:55.599
Ah!

12:55.975 --> 12:59.062
Here's why
the floodlights went out.

13:00.021 --> 13:02.106
It looks like
a rat got to this.

13:02.232 --> 13:04.483
Ew! I fucking hate rats.

13:05.026 --> 13:07.904
My brother had one
while we were growing up.

13:08.029 --> 13:09.906
It was kind of cute, actually.

13:09.989 --> 13:11.741
He named it Antonio.

13:13.243 --> 13:15.578
I saw one chewed
up a baby's face.

13:15.703 --> 13:17.997
I named it "fuckin'
face-chewing rat."

13:18.706 --> 13:19.999
You gonna fix the wire or what?

13:20.124 --> 13:21.458
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:25.171 --> 13:26.172
Ah! Shit!

13:26.256 --> 13:27.631
Did you turn off the switch?

13:27.757 --> 13:29.092
I thought that you
turned off the switch.

13:29.217 --> 13:30.593
Oh, man!

13:30.676 --> 13:32.595
It's okay. It's my fault.

13:34.889 --> 13:37.600
So you're back
in the rooms, huh?

13:38.851 --> 13:40.811
I hope they didn't
stick you with De Marco.

13:40.937 --> 13:42.772
I mean, she's super
nice and everything,

13:42.897 --> 13:47.610
but, man, that breathing machine
can just drive you bonkers.

13:49.279 --> 13:52.782
You know, if you want,
I can make you some ear plugs.

13:52.865 --> 13:55.326
I take a little bit of
stuffing out of a pillow,

13:55.450 --> 13:57.954
and I just smush it
up in some Vaseline,

13:58.246 --> 14:01.791
and then I wrap it up in some
plastic wrap from the sack lunches.

14:01.874 --> 14:05.420
The rooms is full, all right?
I'm in the ghetto tonight.

14:05.628 --> 14:07.880
But you could still
use them in there.

14:07.964 --> 14:09.966
I'll make you some, okay?

14:12.302 --> 14:15.846
Jesus fucking shit.

14:16.597 --> 14:17.932
Sorry?

14:18.933 --> 14:20.059
What?

14:23.479 --> 14:24.563
It was you.

14:25.315 --> 14:26.316
What?

14:26.441 --> 14:28.318
The screwdriver what.

14:28.443 --> 14:30.820
Acting all sweet
like a piece of candy.

14:31.737 --> 14:34.324
Nobody's sweet in
here except for a reason.

14:35.825 --> 14:37.534
I don't know what
you're talking about.

14:37.660 --> 14:40.496
Do not fucking
lie to me, bitch.

14:41.372 --> 14:44.792
Do not fucking insult me
after what you done already.

14:53.217 --> 14:54.302
In my defense,

14:55.261 --> 14:56.846
I would just like
to point out that technically,

14:56.971 --> 14:58.812
you did not go down
because of the screwdriver.

14:58.848 --> 15:00.128
Technically,
you went down to SHU

15:00.183 --> 15:01.767
because you got all
up in Caputo's face.

15:01.851 --> 15:05.355
Lady, we in a tight-ass space
and I bench 140.

15:05.438 --> 15:08.316
You sure "technically" is how
you wanna handle this shit?

15:11.361 --> 15:12.611
Are you gonna say anything?

15:14.947 --> 15:16.240
I ain't a snitch.

15:22.579 --> 15:23.580
Damn!

15:26.376 --> 15:29.086
See? This one got
the same number on both ends.

15:29.212 --> 15:31.047
The first time you play that,
it's called a spinner.

15:31.130 --> 15:34.384
You have to play the ends
and the sides, both.

15:35.009 --> 15:37.594
Like a no-class girl
lets you use any hole.

15:37.720 --> 15:38.721
(CHUCKLING)

15:39.347 --> 15:40.390
Yeah.

15:48.856 --> 15:52.402
These are all the places I'm
gonna travel when I get out.

15:52.485 --> 15:55.696
Starting with Anguilla.

15:55.779 --> 15:58.574
I read that Orlando Bloom
honeymooned there.

15:58.699 --> 16:00.139
And Courteney Cox
and David Arquette,

16:00.243 --> 16:01.660
even though that
didn't work out.

16:02.036 --> 16:05.664
I love the beach,
but I burn like a lobster,

16:05.748 --> 16:07.417
so I'm gonna get
a good swim shirt

16:07.500 --> 16:10.836
and, bonus, it's gonna hide
the gallbladder scar.

16:19.970 --> 16:21.431
Oh, yeah. Sure.

16:21.556 --> 16:24.434
Come on. Okay, bitches,

16:24.559 --> 16:27.353
who's first in line
for some puppy lovin'?

16:27.770 --> 16:29.272
Puppy lovin'!

16:32.400 --> 16:33.692
He's so cute.

16:33.776 --> 16:35.903
He looks just like my dog
from when I was a kid.

16:35.986 --> 16:37.447
Except mine was
more of a Dachshund,

16:37.613 --> 16:39.115
but the nostril
part is the same.

16:39.365 --> 16:40.908
You look just like Chummy.

16:41.284 --> 16:42.952
Make him do a trick.

16:43.077 --> 16:44.870
She doesn't know any yet.

16:44.995 --> 16:46.581
Well, maybe you can
take some time off

16:46.705 --> 16:48.249
from sitting
around eating all day,

16:48.332 --> 16:50.209
and teach him something.

16:50.334 --> 16:52.295
(LAUGHING SARCASTICALLY)

16:52.378 --> 16:53.879
(MOUTHING) Fucking asshole.

16:53.963 --> 16:56.799
Chapman wrote me three letters
for my case and it did fuck-all.

16:56.924 --> 16:59.135
They ain't lettin' people out who
hasn't done their whole time.

16:59.302 --> 17:02.472
Well, I ain't people.
I'm training for this, bitch.

17:02.638 --> 17:06.016
And I ain't never comin' back,
neither, not like the rest of y'all.

17:06.434 --> 17:09.811
Like Oprah say,
"the road less traveled."

17:09.936 --> 17:11.814
You know, that doesn't mean
what everybody thinks it means.

17:12.064 --> 17:14.650
Aw, shit, we about to
get educated and shit.

17:14.775 --> 17:17.319
No, no, no. I'm just saying that
everyone thinks the poem means

17:17.403 --> 17:19.321
to break away from the crowd
and, like, do your own thing.

17:19.446 --> 17:21.324
But if you read it,
Frost is very clear

17:21.491 --> 17:23.367
that the two roads
are exactly the same.

17:23.492 --> 17:25.118
He just chooses one at random.

17:25.202 --> 17:27.704
And then it's only later at a dinner
party, when he's talking about it

17:27.829 --> 17:28.956
that he tells
everybody he chose

17:29.039 --> 17:30.679
the road less
traveled by, but he's lying.

17:35.087 --> 17:36.797
So the point of the poem is,

17:36.880 --> 17:38.174
that everyone
wants to look back

17:38.299 --> 17:39.509
and think that
their choices mattered,

17:39.634 --> 17:43.262
but in reality, shit just happens
the way that it happens,

17:43.346 --> 17:45.598
and it does not mean anything.

17:47.099 --> 17:49.852
I will probably kill
her in her sleep tonight.

17:49.977 --> 17:51.854
Wake me up so I can watch.

17:53.189 --> 17:54.565
I'm gonna...

17:56.192 --> 17:57.693
Laundry.

17:57.776 --> 18:00.446
You ever notice how some dog
breeds, they sound kind of dirty?

18:00.946 --> 18:05.493
Like, shih tzu,
cocker, Jack-something.

18:06.869 --> 18:07.911
Poodle.

18:08.204 --> 18:11.332
(LAUGHING) That is good.

18:12.208 --> 18:15.211
I didn't think of that one.
That is very clever.

18:15.961 --> 18:18.548
BIG BOO: Hey, you know what, guys?
Look at that face.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.508
I'm gonna call her Little Boo.
Aw!

18:20.591 --> 18:23.760
Little Boo.
Who's a little boo? Yes!

drop this off, but...

18:37.567 --> 18:38.775
Tomorrow.

18:38.901 --> 18:39.902
Just give it.

18:42.405 --> 18:43.406
Give it to me.

MAN ON PA:
Attention all personnel,

18:47.493 --> 18:50.246
be advised count is off. Can
we please conduct a recount?

18:58.421 --> 19:01.006
Do you remember the Four
Seasons in the Seychelles?

19:06.262 --> 19:08.556
Gosh, we just threw
our laundry into the hallway,

19:08.639 --> 19:10.516
it was like 40 bucks
for a pair of pants.

19:21.193 --> 19:22.236
(SIGHING) Hey.

19:25.364 --> 19:27.366
I've been thinking about it...

19:29.034 --> 19:30.035
...a lot.

19:32.871 --> 19:34.998
And I just
wanted to let you know

19:35.124 --> 19:37.293
that there are
no hard feelings.

19:37.501 --> 19:42.131
I was pretty angry,
but, I'm over it.

19:44.258 --> 19:46.135
So, um...

19:48.137 --> 19:49.430
Friend?

19:51.474 --> 19:52.475
Wow.

19:54.644 --> 19:56.312

big of you, Pipes.

dance on a pole.

20:08.991 --> 20:13.996
If you want to be a stripper,
you can wait until I die.

20:14.204 --> 20:19.585
It's not stripping. It's for nice
ladies, housewives. For exercise.

20:20.002 --> 20:23.714
That's what they tell you!

20:24.173 --> 20:26.717
Then one day you
wake up in Atlantic City...

20:27.176 --> 20:29.011
where girls are trash...

20:29.094 --> 20:31.806
and I'm lighting candles
under your picture.

21:18.227 --> 21:20.855
You look very
pretty in that dress.

21:21.564 --> 21:24.941
Thank you, Sam. It is very...

21:26.902 --> 21:27.903
...blue.

21:34.910 --> 21:36.751
You guys ever notice how,
once you're a couple,

21:36.787 --> 21:38.707
you pretty much only hang out
with other couples?

21:39.582 --> 21:43.836
A guy, a girl and another guy?
It just looks weird.

21:43.960 --> 21:45.838
People probably just assume
you're divorced.

21:46.589 --> 21:49.425
Oh. Great, so,
I look divorced,

21:49.550 --> 21:53.970
which conveys sadness and
ex-wife shit and lawyers' fees,

21:54.096 --> 21:56.223
or I look single,
34 and single,

21:56.348 --> 21:58.475
which must mean there's
something wrong with me.

21:58.601 --> 22:01.478
Like, you keep
large reptiles in tanks.

22:01.604 --> 22:03.689
Or I have a very special
relationship with my mother.

22:04.774 --> 22:06.901

22:07.109 --> 22:08.549

switch seats with Pete?

22:08.652 --> 22:10.172

right, babe?

look like a loser.

complaining about, right?

stipulate there are children

22:28.881 --> 22:30.507
are dying of
diarrhea in Malawi.

22:30.633 --> 22:32.914
That doesn't mean we don't get
to complain about our lives.

22:32.927 --> 22:36.012
I am pregnant and the heat in our
apartment is always too high

22:36.138 --> 22:38.557

he's grown that horrible beard.

spend on healthcare per year?

27:38.899 --> 27:40.274
(CHUCKLES)

27:40.358 --> 27:44.696
Walking for a half an hour a day
reduces the risk of anxiety,

arthritis, depression, things
like dementia and diabetes.

27:48.867 --> 27:49.910

27:49.993 --> 27:53.038
If you could save money
on medical expenses

27:53.122 --> 27:56.374
with something as simple as
walking, why wouldn't you?

27:57.126 --> 27:58.207
I mean, in the long term...

27:58.292 --> 28:02.089
No one here gives a crap
about the long term, Chapman.

28:02.965 --> 28:04.007

28:05.550 --> 28:07.761
Oops. Sorry.

done taking orders.

28:12.099 --> 28:13.100
(DOOR CLOSES)

28:15.269 --> 28:16.812
Sitting around all day
is the worst possible thing

28:16.937 --> 28:18.480
that you can do for your body.

28:18.605 --> 28:19.765
We're already doing the time.

28:19.815 --> 28:21.233
I've got a deal
for you, Chapman.

28:23.193 --> 28:27.990
Caputo thinks a CO's been putting
inside photos on the Internet,

28:28.364 --> 28:31.701
but I think that kind of nonsense
is too stupid even for a CO.

28:32.077 --> 28:33.411
I don't know
what you're asking.

28:34.746 --> 28:38.917
Let's say an inmate is hiding a
camera or a cell phone or something.

28:40.085 --> 28:44.464
And you find it for me, I'll take
a look at opening that track.

28:47.509 --> 28:49.385
Prison's a big place,
Mr. Healy.

28:50.179 --> 28:52.181

30:03.085 --> 30:04.920

30:05.045 --> 30:06.213

30:09.758 --> 30:10.759
They were fake.

30:10.926 --> 30:11.927

half-Brazilian.

Thank you, sir.

30:35.367 --> 30:36.952
Let the record show

30:37.077 --> 30:39.955
I only had three infractions
for all my time here.

30:40.080 --> 30:44.293
One was for smacking a bitch for not
respecting my ice machine choices,

30:44.418 --> 30:48.463
and, well, the second...
They was bullshit.

30:48.546 --> 30:52.008
Also, I ain't never missed a
day workin' in the library.

30:52.217 --> 30:56.179
Don't say, "workin'," say, "employed."
The shit sound more elegant.

30:56.471 --> 30:59.015
Also, maybe go easy
on the bitch-smacking?

30:59.141 --> 31:00.392
Like, don't bring that shit up.

31:01.310 --> 31:03.228
All right.
Miss Jefferson,

31:03.353 --> 31:05.314
what have you learned from
your time in prison?

31:05.439 --> 31:07.649
Learned?
I ain't learned nothing.

31:07.774 --> 31:11.069
I came in this motherfucker

31:11.153 --> 31:12.154

31:17.742 --> 31:20.383
We are all just in here 'cause we
took a wrong turn goin' to church.

Listen, what you did or didn't do.
That shit is irrelevant now.

31:25.334 --> 31:26.668

40:44.796 --> 40:47.548
(SNORTS) What, you think Healy's
running around here like a frat boy

40:47.632 --> 40:48.841

40:50.302 --> 40:51.502
I think we should look into it.

40:51.636 --> 40:54.472
Seems kind of irrelevant now,
don't you think?

40:57.350 --> 40:59.144
We both know you're
after my job, Joe.

40:59.811 --> 41:02.563
But I'm not worried. Never have been.
Know why?

41:02.939 --> 41:05.066
'Cause you get
mired down in pettiness

41:05.191 --> 41:07.319
instead of
stepping your shit up.

41:08.736 --> 41:10.071
Nice haircut, by the way.

41:25.920 --> 41:26.963
Thanks.

41:27.255 --> 41:28.423
Sure.

41:29.674 --> 41:31.676
I keep feeling like I know you
from somewhere.

did you?

41:36.514 --> 41:37.682

41:37.765 --> 41:39.017
Nope.

41:39.809 --> 41:42.354
You know, I lived in Red Hook
for a while after college.

41:43.188 --> 41:45.064
I used to bag
groceries at Fairway.

41:45.190 --> 41:46.358
No way!

41:46.565 --> 41:48.485
Oh, my God, I remember you.

41:48.567 --> 41:49.986
You were always
forgetting your cloth bags.

41:50.111 --> 41:51.511
And I would pack
everything in paper

41:51.570 --> 41:53.698
and then you'd remember and get
the bags out of your purse

41:53.781 --> 41:55.116
and make me
re-pack everything.

41:55.658 --> 41:58.495
Oh, boy. Yeah, I guess that did
happen a couple of times, huh.

41:58.661 --> 42:02.040
Every time. For months.
You were a pain in the ass.

42:02.123 --> 42:03.458
Well...

42:03.666 --> 42:05.960
Who'da thunk we'd
end up here, huh?

42:07.337 --> 42:10.965
Anyway, I just want you to know,
that as far as I'm concerned,

42:11.049 --> 42:12.884
you and me are the same.

42:13.634 --> 42:14.635
Pardon?

42:14.719 --> 42:15.720
The only
difference between us is,

42:15.803 --> 42:18.556
when I made bad decisions in
life, I didn't get caught.

42:18.681 --> 42:20.850
It coulda been me
here in khaki, easy.

42:22.268 --> 42:23.478
Thank you for saying that.

42:26.064 --> 42:27.565

it's really nice to know

42:27.690 --> 42:29.192

somebody on our side.

42:29.650 --> 42:31.152
Well, you know.

42:33.988 --> 42:37.033
You know what would really help
to boost morale around here?

42:41.538 --> 42:43.248
You know, I saw that
bitch heading on over

42:43.331 --> 42:46.584
to Healy's office,
looking guilty as fuck.

42:47.793 --> 42:50.922
Guess suckin' dick's a little
easier than honest hard work.

42:51.089 --> 42:53.049
I feel sorry for her.

42:56.135 --> 42:58.012
You're right, Leanne.
Compassion

42:58.137 --> 43:00.056
is what we got
over the monkeys.

43:01.266 --> 43:02.434
You know what, though?

43:02.559 --> 43:06.645
Compassion ain't gonna help this
girl learn the way of things.

43:06.771 --> 43:08.314

she's got the Bambi shtick
going on, I get all of it.

43:24.456 --> 43:28.000
But I'm gonna need you to
shut the fuck up about her

43:28.126 --> 43:30.503
and get over your shit.

43:30.920 --> 43:31.963
Or what?

43:39.304 --> 43:40.805
Or I will fuck you.

43:42.515 --> 43:43.891
Literally.

43:44.976 --> 43:47.479
I will sneak into your bunk
in the middle of the night

43:47.645 --> 43:49.522
and I'll lick your pussy.

43:49.939 --> 43:53.234
And I will do it
so good and so soft

43:53.318 --> 43:56.529

of coming by the time you wake up,

43:56.654 --> 43:57.989

and you'll beg for it.

Oh, you will beg for it.

44:05.413 --> 44:07.999

and maybe I won't,

44:08.124 --> 44:11.252

The things you feel?

44:13.546 --> 44:15.840
They will ruin you forever.
