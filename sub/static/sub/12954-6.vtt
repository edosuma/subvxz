Previsouly on Alias...

00:03.685 --> 00:04.685
Hello, Arvin.

00:05.686 --> 00:06.686
Hello, Gordon.

00:08.060 --> 00:10.247
So you're my mysterious benefactor.

00:10.499 --> 00:12.749
Your security clearance hasn't been reinstated.

00:12.750 --> 00:15.434
My chances of returning to APO are slim.

00:15.435 --> 00:17.185
I need you at A.P.O.

00:19.059 --> 00:22.121
I had to dig through my friends yesterday

00:22.312 --> 00:23.749
because of Gordon Dean.

00:23.810 --> 00:27.435
If I can help you stop him, then that's what I need to do.

00:36.499 --> 00:39.749
Hey, dad, Fiona wants to know if I can come over and study for awhile.

00:39.750 --> 00:41.875
Maybe tomorrow night, okay kiddo?

00:49.224 --> 00:51.311
I left another message.

00:51.360 --> 00:53.812
Look, you know she's always travelling.

00:53.813 --> 00:55.375
I mean, where is she now, Europe?

00:55.376 --> 00:58.126
Yeah, but she usually calls.

00:59.171 --> 01:01.233
Come... that's okay. I got it.

01:01.988 --> 01:04.988
It's probably just, you know, a circuit breaker.

01:41.736 --> 01:43.111
How much do they know?

01:44.363 --> 01:45.363
Not much...

01:46.113 --> 01:48.273
that this is a government facility,

01:48.274 --> 01:51.050
That they're here for their own protection.

01:52.299 --> 01:54.737
- I've ruined their lives.
- That's not true.

01:54.738 --> 01:56.425
They can't go home.

01:56.606 --> 01:57.714
They can't go back to work.

01:57.715 --> 01:59.685
They can't even say good-bye to their friends.

01:59.686 --> 02:01.735
Because it's not safe. You know that.

02:03.363 --> 02:05.049
There were taps on their phones.

02:05.050 --> 02:07.112
There was surveillance equipment.

02:07.172 --> 02:10.797
Witness protection is the best way to ensure their safety.

02:14.424 --> 02:17.111
They say I won't even be able to call them.

02:18.797 --> 02:20.984
How am I supposed to do this alone?

02:22.673 --> 02:25.423
You do it because you don't have a choice...

02:26.548 --> 02:30.423
because you want the world to be safe for the people you love.

02:34.864 --> 02:37.800
I know some people think I'm crazy, still working like this,

02:37.801 --> 02:42.738
but I can't go home and sit there and just be pregnant.

02:44.487 --> 02:47.924
Not when the men who killed Vaughn are still out there.

02:48.923 --> 02:51.110
It's my responsibility to stop them

02:53.550 --> 02:55.237
so this baby can be safe...

02:57.613 --> 02:59.550
so you can be with your family.

03:05.425 --> 03:07.237
We're kind of a weird family.

03:10.239 --> 03:11.989
We actually like each other.

03:14.673 --> 03:17.548
Then go in there and let them see you're okay.

03:19.612 --> 03:21.299
That's all they care about.

03:25.923 --> 03:26.923
Okay.

03:32.799 --> 03:35.186
My God! Rachel!

03:36.862 --> 03:39.237
I wanted to call. I just... I couldn't.

03:39.363 --> 03:41.987
We were worried something had happened to you.

03:41.988 --> 03:46.050
Something did happen, and that's why you're here.

03:46.799 --> 03:48.111
Where do I begin?

03:48.799 --> 03:49.799
Okay...

03:50.925 --> 03:55.051
Rachel Gibson's family has been moved to a witness protection program.

03:55.052 --> 03:56.677
We knew that might happen.

03:57.176 --> 03:59.548
I will not hurt Rachel or anyone else from A.P.O.

03:59.549 --> 04:00.985
It was not part of our agreement.

04:00.986 --> 04:03.361
Our agreement is whatever I say it is.

04:03.799 --> 04:08.111
I'm the one who got you out of prison, and I can easily put you back.

04:08.300 --> 04:10.075
Let me say this again.

04:10.987 --> 04:12.799
I will not hurt those people.

04:13.427 --> 04:16.113
I'm not telling you to... not yet, at least.

04:17.301 --> 04:20.365
But we both know you'll do whatever it takes to save your daughter.

04:20.366 --> 04:24.616
If that means you have to hurt a few people along the way, so be it.

04:24.799 --> 04:26.611
- Are we finished?
- Almost.

04:28.114 --> 04:31.426
Have you heard of a weapons designer named Janos Vak?

04:31.675 --> 04:32.675
No.

04:33.615 --> 04:36.487
We've been after him for some time. He's disappeared.

04:36.488 --> 04:39.988
I want you to use your resources at A.P.O. and find him.

04:42.116 --> 04:46.116
What would your colleagues do if they knew you answered to me...

04:46.799 --> 04:49.674
that you were betraying them on a daily basis?

04:50.549 --> 04:52.986
Same thing I hope to do to you someday.

04:56.366 --> 04:57.991
Call me when you find Vak.

05:50.764 --> 05:53.577
Now that Arvin's returned in the capacity of Assistant Director,

05:53.578 --> 05:56.703
I've asked him to read Rachel Gibson's debriefing.

05:56.827 --> 05:57.827
I believe his

05:58.139 --> 06:01.200
unique insights into a covert organization like The Shed

06:01.201 --> 06:03.138
will be extremely useful to us.

06:03.450 --> 06:04.450
Thank you, Jack.

06:05.391 --> 06:08.453
This is an extremely well insulated organization.

06:08.700 --> 06:10.763
Of all the names mentioned in the debrief,

06:10.764 --> 06:13.515
there was only one that I recognized immediately...

06:13.516 --> 06:15.703
a weapons designer named Janos Vak.

06:17.140 --> 06:18.826
Mr. Vak is a Hungarian national.

06:18.827 --> 06:23.140
For the past decade, he has specialized in designing targeting software.

06:23.141 --> 06:24.578
His present obsession...

06:24.801 --> 06:26.738
he calls it "lasso technology. "

06:26.925 --> 06:28.736
DoD.'s been worried about this.

06:28.737 --> 06:30.426
It's a software program that would allow

06:30.427 --> 06:31.718
an incoming missile to be

06:31.719 --> 06:33.989
electronically intercepted and redirected.

06:33.990 --> 06:35.115
Right. Basically,

06:35.216 --> 06:36.301
you could lasso a missile

06:36.302 --> 06:38.111
that was headed for a military target, say

06:38.112 --> 06:41.674
in the Middle East, and then redirect it to Switzerland, you know?

06:41.675 --> 06:43.647
And then the Swiss call, and they're like,

06:43.648 --> 06:45.114
"Hey, we're neutral, remember?"

06:45.115 --> 06:47.114
Thank you, Marshall. I think we all understand.

06:47.115 --> 06:48.731
Right. That was just a hypothetical...

06:48.732 --> 06:50.489
Based on Ms. Gibson's statement,

06:50.550 --> 06:54.675
Gordon Dean has been trying to locate Vak for the past six months.

06:54.865 --> 06:57.603
Arvin has suggested, and I agree, that if we can find Vak first,

06:57.604 --> 07:00.564
we can then use him as bait to catch Gordon Dean.

07:00.614 --> 07:02.798
In the past, he has been known to frequently partner

07:02.799 --> 07:05.411
with an Algerian arms broker.

07:06.114 --> 07:08.615
Evidently, they had a meeting a few months ago.

07:08.616 --> 07:10.423
Nobody has heard from Vak since.

07:10.424 --> 07:13.924
The Algerian underworld is particularly difficult to penetrate.

07:13.925 --> 07:16.237
I think I know someone who can do it.

07:16.865 --> 07:17.860
Renée Rienne.

07:17.861 --> 07:19.456
Yeah.

07:21.617 --> 07:25.492
Make contact with her. See if she can get a lead on Janos Vak.

07:29.616 --> 07:32.903
Sydney, I haven't had a chance to thank you

07:32.989 --> 07:36.549
for the letter of recommendation you wrote to the tribunal.

07:36.550 --> 07:40.175
I know it helped persuade the judges regarding my release.

07:40.176 --> 07:41.176
You're welcome.

07:42.874 --> 07:45.109
Look, there's something I need to confess to you,

07:45.110 --> 07:47.801
and I hope you don't judge me too harshly for it.

07:52.304 --> 07:55.779
Every day, I go to the hospital to visit Nadia.

07:57.050 --> 08:00.600
I get off at her floor, talk to the doctors.

08:02.617 --> 08:08.279
And yet, I cannot set foot into her room.

08:09.839 --> 08:13.339
I can't bear to see her hooked up to all those machines,

08:14.338 --> 08:16.025
knowing that it's my fault.

08:20.589 --> 08:23.689
I know you'll do everything in your power to find a cure for Nadia.

08:25.594 --> 08:26.594
Yes, I will.

08:27.845 --> 08:30.845
I will do whatever it takes to save my daughter.

09:59.330 --> 10:00.330
Sorry.

10:01.081 --> 10:03.456
No, you can use the bag. I'm done.

10:03.457 --> 10:06.013
No, I don't really like to work out around other people.

10:06.014 --> 10:08.805
Hey... I could use somebody to spar with.

10:09.767 --> 10:11.904
I don't really... spar.

10:13.146 --> 10:14.146
I don't either.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.707
Which is why I could really use your help.

10:18.144 --> 10:20.956
Don't want to get my ass kicked in the field.

10:21.459 --> 10:22.459
What do you say?

10:23.581 --> 10:24.897
How many fights you been in?

10:24.898 --> 10:26.510
I don't know. Enough.

10:26.705 --> 10:27.705
You win?

10:29.583 --> 10:30.583
Of course.

10:32.645 --> 10:33.645
Mostly.

10:34.707 --> 10:35.895
Why, what did you hear?

10:35.896 --> 10:38.958
Nothing. I've just never been in any real fights.

10:39.333 --> 10:41.458
I kind of want to know what to do.

10:46.268 --> 10:50.255
Not that. Don't ever do that spinning kung fu crap.

10:50.459 --> 10:51.728
You'll get yourself killed.

10:51.729 --> 10:54.845
Okay, fine. What should I be doing?

10:55.143 --> 10:56.143
All right.

10:56.894 --> 10:57.894
For real?

10:59.709 --> 11:01.038
I fight dirty.

11:01.138 --> 11:02.642
Dirty?

11:02.644 --> 11:04.329
Go for the eyes, the throat, the nuts.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.330
The nuts?

11:05.331 --> 11:10.555
Cause as much damage, inflict as much pain as humanly possible.

11:11.020 --> 11:12.268
I don't know if I can do that.

11:12.269 --> 11:14.331
Well, then you shouldn't be here.

11:15.019 --> 11:18.020
I'm serious! Look, everybody is taking care of you.

11:18.021 --> 11:19.896
If they can't depend on you...

11:20.460 --> 11:23.772
just go pack up your playthings! Go home to mom and...

11:32.707 --> 11:33.707
That was better.

11:36.584 --> 11:38.271
I want to see more of that.

11:44.393 --> 11:45.393
Tom Grace.

11:46.832 --> 11:47.832
Got it.

11:49.707 --> 11:50.707
Briefing in 15.

11:54.458 --> 11:56.520
Renée located the Algerian arms dealer.

11:56.521 --> 11:58.644
The lasso technology is no longer a rumor.

11:58.645 --> 12:02.519
Janos Vak designed a program to intercept and redirect missiles.

12:02.520 --> 12:04.768
According to the arms dealer, three months ago,

12:04.769 --> 12:07.330
Vak met with a Chinese official who bought the new weapon.

12:07.331 --> 12:09.081
Do we know where Vak is now?

12:09.397 --> 12:12.185
No one's seen him since the meet. He's just dropped off the planet.

12:12.186 --> 12:14.513
Which is why we're going to pursue the Chinese official.

12:14.514 --> 12:15.834
His name is General Li Yum Sung,

12:15.835 --> 12:18.458
and he's staying at the Chinese consulate in Bombay.

12:18.459 --> 12:21.208
The General is marrying an Indian woman next month.

12:21.209 --> 12:23.893
The consulate is throwing them an engagement party.

12:23.894 --> 12:26.083
I've checked with our contact in Indian intelligence.

12:26.084 --> 12:28.396
He says the General keeps an encrypted copy

12:28.397 --> 12:31.456
of his contacts and schedule in a safe in his room.

12:31.457 --> 12:33.144
They should lead us to Vak.

12:33.521 --> 12:35.574
Sydney, you're to break into the General's safe

12:35.575 --> 12:36.685
and acquire the intel.

12:36.686 --> 12:38.522
Agents Dixon and Grace will offer support.

12:39.271 --> 12:42.583
Marshall and Miss Gibson will run op tech. Good luck.

13:20.271 --> 13:21.710
The General is still upstairs.

13:21.711 --> 13:24.411
Doesn't the man know it's kind of hard to break into his safe

13:24.412 --> 13:26.085
if he's sitting right in front of it?

13:28.344 --> 13:30.157
I don't think he's coming down tonight.

13:30.158 --> 13:33.658
See that woman over there? That's the General's fiancée.

13:33.660 --> 13:35.222
She looks pretty unhappy.

13:35.845 --> 13:38.406
I think the General might be having second thoughts.

13:38.407 --> 13:39.151
Hey, Marshall?

13:39.251 --> 13:40.537
Go, Phoenix.

13:40.538 --> 13:41.844
What's going on upstairs?

13:41.845 --> 13:43.845
Wait for uno momento, por favor.

13:47.658 --> 13:49.535
Okay, looks like all's quiet.

13:49.536 --> 13:52.135
Just one soldier outside the General's door,

13:52.136 --> 13:53.406
very sharply dressed.

13:53.407 --> 13:55.721
We've got to go about this a different way.

13:55.722 --> 13:57.348
Remember the prince in Bahrein?

13:57.349 --> 13:58.723
The guy with the harem?

13:58.724 --> 14:01.020
- Let's try and do that.
- What are you talking about?

14:01.021 --> 14:02.031
I'll need your watch.

14:02.032 --> 14:03.969
It's okay, I'm not really here...

14:05.973 --> 14:07.223
Just follow my lead.

14:14.720 --> 14:20.645
I am sorry, but I cannot allow you to marry the other man.

14:22.411 --> 14:23.873
You belong to me.

14:25.849 --> 14:29.086
It is time we told the world the truth.

14:30.533 --> 14:32.658
Our love cannot be denied.

14:39.192 --> 14:40.717
Marry me, Naomika.

14:41.818 --> 14:44.705
Let us share our joy with everyone!

14:46.245 --> 14:47.245
Let go of me!

14:47.744 --> 14:49.244
I know that you love me!

14:50.558 --> 14:51.807
Uh, the lady said let her go.

14:51.808 --> 14:53.433
- What?
- Let her go! Hey!

14:53.930 --> 14:56.430
We are destined for each other, Naomika.

14:57.369 --> 14:59.481
Tell them! Tell them!

15:04.756 --> 15:07.318
Ours is a forbidden love!

15:49.321 --> 15:51.115
She improvised that whole thing.

15:51.116 --> 15:53.540
Yeah, who'd think you could turn a pregnancy into an alias?

15:53.541 --> 15:54.581
And in chinese.

15:54.582 --> 15:57.275
Listen, I've had to do little alias magic myself

15:57.276 --> 15:58.869
to save the day a few times.

15:58.870 --> 15:59.794
Do you know what a spork is?

15:59.795 --> 16:01.368
They're letting her in.

16:13.397 --> 16:14.772
I just need more time.

16:16.461 --> 16:17.461
I just...

16:17.958 --> 16:18.958
need more time.

16:19.524 --> 16:20.524
It's okay.

16:21.336 --> 16:22.398
It's still early.

16:30.960 --> 16:32.146
Okay, Marshall, I'm ready.

16:32.147 --> 16:33.147
Okay...

16:34.896 --> 16:36.957
You know what? I'm not getting a reading, Phoenix.

16:36.962 --> 16:39.055
There must be too much shielding in the building.

16:39.056 --> 16:40.710
Are you saying you can't do it?

16:40.711 --> 16:42.211
Well, no. Of course not.

16:46.022 --> 16:47.956
All right, Phoenix, this is gonna take a sec.

16:47.957 --> 16:48.988
I need to set a relay

16:48.989 --> 16:51.085
closer to the building so I can boost your signal.

16:51.086 --> 16:52.461
- Copy that.
- Got it.

16:52.647 --> 16:55.708
I can do it. You'll need to be here when it's activated.

16:55.709 --> 16:57.271
It'll be faster this way.

16:59.186 --> 17:00.186
Thanks.

17:05.046 --> 17:06.046
Okay.

17:06.308 --> 17:07.335
Thank you for your help.

17:07.336 --> 17:10.522
He's not a bad guy. He's just had his heart broken.

17:10.587 --> 17:11.712
I'll get him home.

17:12.527 --> 17:13.527
Thanks.

17:14.464 --> 17:17.276
Heads up, Phoenix. Fiancée's moving your way.

17:18.089 --> 17:19.839
Marshall, what's the E.T.A.?

17:20.523 --> 17:22.023
Oracle, what's your status?

17:22.025 --> 17:23.400
- Relay's set.
- Okay.

17:25.464 --> 17:26.464
Hang on a sec.

17:27.589 --> 17:30.090
Great. We're at five by five. Way to go.

17:43.712 --> 17:45.399
I've got it. I'm on my way.

18:01.985 --> 18:02.985
I'm busted.

18:03.228 --> 18:04.478
East side of the building.

18:04.479 --> 18:05.479
Wait for Sydney.

18:27.230 --> 18:28.430
Get down.

18:36.414 --> 18:37.414
You okay?

18:38.040 --> 18:42.165
If by okay you mean freaked and embarrassed, then yeah, I'm great.

19:19.543 --> 19:21.043
Finding everything okay?

19:21.606 --> 19:24.664
Yes, thank you. Oh, I'd like to get this, please.

19:24.665 --> 19:25.665
Okay, great.

19:29.165 --> 19:31.915
We get so many dads in the store these days.

19:32.106 --> 19:35.352
I don't think my husband ever bought so much as a diaper.

19:35.353 --> 19:36.353
Yeah.

19:37.355 --> 19:39.730
My dad wasn't exactly hands-on either.

19:40.791 --> 19:43.666
What about your husband? Is he doing his part?

19:45.103 --> 19:46.103
He's been great.

19:47.291 --> 19:48.791
Wishes he could do more.

19:49.916 --> 19:51.166
I love hearing that.

19:53.544 --> 19:55.044
Times sure have changed.

19:56.044 --> 19:57.044
Yeah.

20:04.294 --> 20:05.372
Hello.

20:06.073 --> 20:07.156
Hello.

20:07.231 --> 20:10.843
You altered a suit for me. Here's the ticket.

20:11.480 --> 20:15.605
Oh, yes, why don't you wait in the back, and I'll bring it to you?

20:16.721 --> 20:17.721
Thank you.

20:28.722 --> 20:30.816
You should've told me about the Chinese Consulate

20:30.817 --> 20:31.905
before your team went in.

20:31.906 --> 20:34.468
There was no reason to complicate things.

20:35.407 --> 20:38.782
Anyway, I assumed that you wanted A.P.O. to do the heavy lifting.

20:38.783 --> 20:40.845
You don't get to assume anything.

20:42.406 --> 20:43.968
Did you locate Janos Vak?

20:44.406 --> 20:45.906
The intel was encrypted.

20:46.846 --> 20:50.094
I'll have an answer for you before the end of the day.

20:50.095 --> 20:51.345
Call me when you do.

21:01.095 --> 21:04.970
I don't have time to explain. Yeah, she's here now, thank you.

21:06.531 --> 21:07.531
Hey. - Hey.

21:07.846 --> 21:08.846
We found Vak.

21:09.097 --> 21:11.781
He's secluded on an oil platform in the South China Sea

21:11.782 --> 21:14.219
while he finishes his software program.

21:14.347 --> 21:16.846
Marshall's still pinpointing the exact coordinates.

21:16.847 --> 21:18.534
Great. How are we going in?

21:19.344 --> 21:20.344
We're not.

21:21.161 --> 21:22.161
We're backup.

21:23.532 --> 21:26.032
- Who's my dad sending?
- Rachel Gibson.

21:27.472 --> 21:28.472
Rachel?

21:29.407 --> 21:30.969
He's sending her in solo?

21:33.283 --> 21:34.595
Why would he do that?

21:34.972 --> 21:37.222
The Chinese government has suspended

21:37.531 --> 21:40.155
all shore leave for the men working on the platform.

21:40.156 --> 21:41.970
No one gets on or off until Vak is done.

21:41.971 --> 21:47.071
The sole exception is that every other weekend, Vak is allowed...

21:47.470 --> 21:48.782
female companionship.

21:53.249 --> 21:54.723
We can't send her in alone.

21:54.724 --> 21:57.361
Rachel's incredibly bright. You've seen it yourself.

21:57.362 --> 21:59.594
You saw what happened on our last mission. She ran.

21:59.595 --> 22:01.720
The mission was a success, Sydney.

22:02.535 --> 22:05.344
You may not want to hear it, but this isn't an assignment you can do.

22:05.345 --> 22:07.095
You know it as well as I do.

22:09.472 --> 22:10.472
She's not ready.

22:11.160 --> 22:14.032
At least, delay the mission a few weeks. Just give her time to train.

22:14.033 --> 22:15.047
That's not an option.

22:15.048 --> 22:17.938
If we're going to use Vak and his weapon as bait to catch Gordon Dean,

22:17.939 --> 22:19.222
we can't afford to wait.

22:19.720 --> 22:23.345
This is no different than when you were sent back into SD-6.

22:25.910 --> 22:27.535
It's completely different.

22:28.659 --> 22:29.659
I had Vaughn.

22:31.473 --> 22:33.535
And Rachel will have you.

22:41.910 --> 22:45.346
Okay, once you see Vak alone, you'll need to knock him out, right?

22:45.347 --> 22:48.419
You know, I don't mean, you know, like, rock 'em, sock 'em, knock him out.

22:48.420 --> 22:50.784
It's more of a, um, actually, here we go.

22:50.785 --> 22:53.264
Okay, take a look. Righ, this looks like a normal lipstick.

22:53.265 --> 22:55.720
It's a very nice shade of red. I think it would look good...

22:55.721 --> 22:58.408
but, anyway, touch it anywhere on his skin,

22:58.424 --> 23:00.386
it'll knock him out for at least two hours.

23:00.387 --> 23:03.296
By the time he wakes up, he'll think he had the time of his life.

23:03.297 --> 23:05.104
You... you'll be on a chopper halfway home.

23:05.105 --> 23:08.794
Oh, and, also... I spring-loaded an ice pick into here.

23:09.224 --> 23:10.661
You know, just in case.

23:13.096 --> 23:15.983
But you're probably not gonna... need that.

23:16.099 --> 23:18.911
I mean, I'm sure you'll be... you'll be fine.

23:25.035 --> 23:26.285
Are you about ready?

23:27.848 --> 23:29.971
I've been going to the firing range every night

23:29.972 --> 23:32.534
so that when the time came, I'd be ready.

23:34.096 --> 23:36.346
Of course, on my first solo mission,

23:36.596 --> 23:38.096
I have to go in unarmed.

23:38.847 --> 23:39.847
Rachel...

23:40.283 --> 23:43.532
Jack wouldn't send you in if he didn't have complete faith

23:43.533 --> 23:45.220
in your ability to succeed.

23:45.533 --> 23:49.720
I appreciate you saying that, but I know what everyone is thinking.

23:51.346 --> 23:52.408
I'm the new girl.

23:52.909 --> 23:54.783
I panicked on the last mission.

23:54.784 --> 23:59.158
And everybody is asking whether or not I can do it. And the truth is...

23:59.159 --> 24:00.159
I don't know.

24:01.411 --> 24:02.411
I'm terrified.

24:05.223 --> 24:07.285
But I'm more terrified of not trying.

24:08.523 --> 24:09.565
So...

24:10.835 --> 24:15.222
I'm gonna put on my strappy shoes and my teeny dress, and I'm gonna try.

24:16.307 --> 24:17.845
and by this time tomorrow,

24:19.323 --> 24:21.368
we'll know whether I can do it or not.

24:39.122 --> 24:40.684
Janos Vak has been found.

24:42.871 --> 24:44.372
The details are in here.

24:45.372 --> 24:48.619
A.P.O. is send in your former associate Rachel Gibson.

24:48.620 --> 24:51.308
She's going in solo to get the weapons design.

24:51.504 --> 24:52.514
Gibson?

24:53.230 --> 24:53.980
Alone?

24:53.981 --> 24:57.033
Once she acquires it I'll swap it out.

24:57.749 --> 24:59.497
I'll get you the real program.

25:07.122 --> 25:09.559
Did he just say they're sending Rachel?

25:09.933 --> 25:11.245
I don't trust Sloane.

25:12.869 --> 25:14.181
We're not gonna wait.

25:19.310 --> 25:21.685
I want you to get the weapon yourself.

25:24.057 --> 25:25.244
Is there a problem?

25:26.745 --> 25:29.870
It'll just be strange if Rachel and I cross paths.

25:30.685 --> 25:32.430
She thought I was her best friend.

25:32.431 --> 25:36.681
Look, if we could've convinced her to play on our side, we would have.

25:36.682 --> 25:38.557
But things didn't go that way.

25:40.622 --> 25:42.769
So if I run into her?

25:43.685 --> 25:47.872
Show her the professional courtesy of putting a bullet in her head.

27:07.080 --> 27:08.205
This is a mistake.

27:09.330 --> 27:13.580
I've never done anything like this with the wig and the dress and...

27:16.455 --> 27:18.142
What am I gonna say to him?

27:18.644 --> 27:20.391
Well, it isn't what you'd say.

27:20.392 --> 27:24.267
Remember, you're playing a character. It's what she would say.

27:24.608 --> 27:26.541
Who was the sluttiest girl in your high school?

27:26.542 --> 27:27.594
Mandy Camarillo.

27:28.454 --> 27:30.392
You didn't have to think very hard on that one.

27:30.393 --> 27:32.580
Tramp stole my date at junior prom.

27:32.956 --> 27:35.540
She had red hair and a pierced tongue.

27:36.954 --> 27:38.954
Okay, so you're Mandy Camarillo,

27:39.644 --> 27:41.644
and Janos Vak is your prom date.

27:42.142 --> 27:43.642
Just say what she'd say.

27:46.642 --> 27:48.895
You're not gonna be alone, Rachel. Not for a second.

27:48.896 --> 27:50.896
I'll be on comms the whole time,

27:52.145 --> 27:53.770
the way Vaughn was for me.

27:56.707 --> 27:57.876
It helps a lot...

27:59.075 --> 28:00.147
having you.

28:02.671 --> 28:03.927
I can do this, right?

28:04.642 --> 28:05.676
Absolutely.

28:51.269 --> 28:52.269
Sydney?

28:52.333 --> 28:54.895
Okay, I'm with you, Rachel, just breathe.

29:18.960 --> 29:22.272
You're so cute. They didn't tell me you'd be so cute.

29:23.832 --> 29:25.459
You do speak English, don't you?

29:25.460 --> 29:27.585
I mean, they told me you would speak english.

29:27.586 --> 29:30.076
Of course, English. I love English.

29:32.835 --> 29:33.897
Nice to meet you.

29:35.709 --> 29:36.867
I am Janos.

29:38.024 --> 29:39.792
Ray... Mandy.

29:42.149 --> 29:43.377
Raymandy?

29:44.648 --> 29:45.710
A beautiful name.

29:47.271 --> 29:50.453
So this is where you live, huh? It's pretty sweet.

29:51.710 --> 29:53.082
Only for a few more days.

29:53.083 --> 29:55.083
My business here is almost done.

29:56.960 --> 29:58.522
You must get very lonely.

29:58.959 --> 30:01.648
Well, yes, which is why I'm so happy to see you.

30:01.649 --> 30:05.961
Perhaps you would be more comfortable over here on the bed, Raymandy.

30:06.396 --> 30:08.069
No, I'm, uh, I'm good.

30:08.772 --> 30:11.084
Come on, Rachel. What would Mandy do?

30:11.646 --> 30:13.771
Do you know how to make daiquiris?

30:13.774 --> 30:14.745
I have champagne.

30:14.746 --> 30:16.209
Even better.

30:19.960 --> 30:20.960
Idiot.

30:28.237 --> 30:29.237
Uh-oh.

30:29.674 --> 30:30.660
What do you mean, "uh-oh?"

30:30.660 --> 30:32.189
I dropped my lipstick.

30:32.612 --> 30:36.424
Not a problem, your lips are absolutely perfect

30:36.425 --> 30:38.251
just the way they are.

30:38.610 --> 30:41.117
Don't let him kiss you. You're the one in charge.

30:41.153 --> 30:42.301
Let me show you.

30:50.177 --> 30:51.526
Has baby been bad?

30:55.236 --> 30:57.611
This is gonna be too easy, Rachel.

31:17.114 --> 31:19.550
Raymandy, you're driving me crazy!

31:22.302 --> 31:23.864
Did I say you could talk?

31:30.862 --> 31:32.549
You've been a very bad boy.

31:33.049 --> 31:34.049
I'm sorry.

31:34.543 --> 31:38.113
But you know what? I'm gonna be honest with you.

31:41.177 --> 31:43.672
This whole "baby talk" thing kinda creeps me out.

31:43.673 --> 31:46.235
So I'm just gonna cut to the chase, okay?

31:49.674 --> 31:50.674
I gotta go.

32:03.926 --> 32:04.727
Downloading now.

32:04.728 --> 32:05.903
You're doing great.

32:29.708 --> 32:32.148
Phoenix, I've got the data. I destroyed the original.

32:32.149 --> 32:34.248
Copy that. Almost home.

32:48.272 --> 32:50.520
Phoenix, I've got a small problem.

32:50.835 --> 32:53.211
There's a dead soldier and the boat's gone.

32:53.212 --> 32:56.274
Copy that. I'm sending in an emergency extraction. Outrigger?

32:56.275 --> 32:57.899
We heard, Phoenix. We're on our way.

32:57.900 --> 33:00.462
Rendezvous in approximately five minutes.

33:05.023 --> 33:07.042
Did you hear that, Rachel? You're gonna be fine.

33:07.051 --> 33:08.521
Just make your way to the helideck.

33:08.522 --> 33:09.522
Copy that.

33:42.334 --> 33:43.334
Surprise.

33:44.650 --> 33:46.525
- My God, you're...
- Not dead?

33:46.836 --> 33:48.148
I was gonna say evil.

33:49.813 --> 33:50.858
Tell me I'm wrong.

33:52.148 --> 33:54.835
Let's just say we work for different teams.

33:55.210 --> 33:58.025
You knew this whole time. You were in on it with Dean!

33:58.026 --> 33:59.338
I wanted to tell you.

33:59.401 --> 34:02.459
You blew up that building and you killed all those people.

34:02.460 --> 34:03.960
It wasn't personal. I...

34:04.087 --> 34:05.274
I always liked you.

34:05.275 --> 34:06.664
It was a lie... everything we did!

34:06.665 --> 34:07.689
That's enough!

34:09.058 --> 34:10.870
And now you're gonna kill me.

34:12.121 --> 34:13.559
That's what Dean wants.

34:15.436 --> 34:18.561
You've made it really hard for him since you left.

34:20.496 --> 34:21.496
Like I said...

34:23.371 --> 34:24.558
I always liked you.

34:26.623 --> 34:28.185
I don't want to kill you.

34:29.435 --> 34:31.243
Just give me Vak's software program

34:31.266 --> 34:33.204
and you walk away from this.

34:33.871 --> 34:36.550
Rachel, we can always track Peyton after she leaves the platform.

34:36.551 --> 34:38.870
If you believe she'll let you live, give her the data.

34:38.871 --> 34:41.370
Your life is more important than the mission.

34:41.371 --> 34:42.371
Come on, Rachel.

34:43.060 --> 34:44.871
You're in way over your head.

34:45.870 --> 34:47.370
Don't make me shoot you.

34:49.371 --> 34:50.433
Give me the disk.

34:55.498 --> 34:56.498
Okay.

35:02.187 --> 35:04.062
You've got two seconds. One...

35:05.934 --> 35:06.934
Here.

35:11.059 --> 35:12.059
You bitch!

35:20.874 --> 35:22.874
You should've given me the disk.

35:23.875 --> 35:25.750
You were gonna kill me anyway.

35:26.312 --> 35:27.312
Yeah.

35:27.894 --> 35:29.935
But I would've felt bad about it.

35:31.874 --> 35:33.249
Now it's gonna be fun.

35:45.684 --> 35:46.746
Still having fun?

37:04.686 --> 37:05.688
You're late.

37:05.689 --> 37:07.688
I told you none of my people were to get hurt.

37:07.689 --> 37:10.430
I do what I want, when I want. Now where is it?

37:10.431 --> 37:11.500
You didn't trust me

37:11.501 --> 37:13.310
and you nearly ruined the entire operation.

37:13.311 --> 37:14.738
I want the weapon.

37:14.739 --> 37:16.580
You don't get to have it.

37:17.060 --> 37:18.810
That's my price for your mistake.

37:18.811 --> 37:19.811
My mistake?

37:20.748 --> 37:23.313
I'm not the one responsible for 100,000 deaths.

37:23.314 --> 37:26.375
I'm not the one dangling on the end of a fish hook.

37:26.376 --> 37:28.238
I'm the one who decides if the little fish

37:28.239 --> 37:29.624
gets thrown back into the pond,

37:29.625 --> 37:32.935
or if it gets flushed down the toilet. Am I being clear?

37:32.936 --> 37:35.223
You don't get Vak's weapon.

37:37.939 --> 37:39.189
How's your daughter?

37:41.064 --> 37:43.189
Nadia has nothing to do with this.

37:43.748 --> 37:44.873
Sure she does.

37:47.747 --> 37:51.684
I want a copy of the lasso software first thing in the morning.

38:22.812 --> 38:24.562
Your father's kind of scary.

38:24.999 --> 38:26.061
Tell me about it.

38:27.190 --> 38:28.998
But he said we all did good so...

38:28.999 --> 38:30.536
No, you did great.

38:32.886 --> 38:33.896
Thanks...

38:34.554 --> 38:35.787
for being in my head.

38:36.510 --> 38:37.510
You're welcome.

38:38.760 --> 38:40.382
I know how important that voice can be.

38:40.383 --> 38:44.258
Vaughn talked me through all my early missions with the C.I.A.

38:45.633 --> 38:49.258
Sometimes his voice was the only thing that kept me going.

38:50.259 --> 38:51.884
I wish I could've met him.

38:55.383 --> 38:56.758
I'll see you tomorrow.

40:33.701 --> 40:34.701
You okay?

40:35.259 --> 40:37.134
Just having some trouble picking the lock.

40:37.135 --> 40:38.760
My fingers are kinda numb.

40:39.449 --> 40:42.885
Look, you're almost home. Just get inside and plant the bug.

40:43.011 --> 40:44.636
That's easy for you to say.

40:44.637 --> 40:46.571
It's 20-below out here. You're nice and warm.

40:46.572 --> 40:48.325
I'll tell you what, I'll talk to Langley,

40:48.326 --> 40:50.884
see if we can send you someplace warm next time.

40:50.885 --> 40:52.322
It should have a beach.

40:52.951 --> 40:54.238
Absolutely.

40:54.295 --> 40:56.884
I'll find a bad guy who owns a really nice beach resort,

40:56.885 --> 41:00.072
and you'll have to go undercover for like, a month.

41:00.138 --> 41:02.910
You know what? That sounds pretty dangerous.

41:02.911 --> 41:04.450
Maybe we both should go.

41:04.457 --> 41:05.769
You'd do that for me?

41:06.079 --> 41:07.918
Hey, we're in this together, right?
