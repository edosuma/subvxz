00:53.209 --> 00:54.626
Where is Biggie Chen?

00:57.751 --> 00:59.417
I told you. He's in Manila.

00:59.959 --> 01:01.667
Where exactly?

01:04.042 --> 01:05.167
- Sir Alvarez!
- Don't look at him.

01:05.167 --> 01:06.334
He's not gonna help you!

01:06.334 --> 01:07.751
I own you.

01:08.084 --> 01:10.209
Look at me.
You motherfucker!

01:10.209 --> 01:11.334
Answer me!

01:11.334 --> 01:12.459
Where is Biggie Chen?

01:13.459 --> 01:14.167
Dela Cruz.

01:15.084 --> 01:16.417
Dela Cruz.

01:43.042 --> 01:43.792
You know,

01:45.251 --> 01:47.334
we both want this to end.

01:48.709 --> 01:51.417
But that will only happen if you help us.

01:55.209 --> 01:57.459
I'm sure you're tired of all this.

02:00.792 --> 02:01.501
Help us.

02:02.542 --> 02:05.584
And I swear, we'll protect you.

02:17.459 --> 02:18.542
He's in Tondo.

02:24.126 --> 02:24.792
What did you say?

02:26.417 --> 02:27.209
In Tondo.

02:27.251 --> 02:27.917
Tondo?

02:27.959 --> 02:28.834
Yes, sir.

02:31.209 --> 02:32.251
Really now?

02:38.834 --> 02:39.834
Look at this.

02:43.917 --> 02:44.751
What is it?

02:46.292 --> 02:47.376
That's Tondo, sir.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.709
Do you know what the blue area means?

02:54.959 --> 02:55.834
Peace?

03:01.417 --> 03:03.709
If a district is code blue,

03:03.709 --> 03:05.709
that means it's already drug-free.

03:06.292 --> 03:07.959
I helped rehabilitate that place.

03:07.959 --> 03:09.251
You can't fool me.

03:15.084 --> 03:18.751
Now I get it!

03:18.751 --> 03:20.251
That was you?

03:20.251 --> 03:22.459
What the fuck is so funny?

03:25.584 --> 03:27.959
It's just that you look like

03:27.959 --> 03:29.751
you just got out of rehab.

03:46.709 --> 03:47.834
It hurts.

03:53.167 --> 03:54.334
HonesHy,sH.

03:54.959 --> 03:56.501
No matter how you clean up that place,

03:57.042 --> 04:00.376
they will eventually return.

04:01.959 --> 04:03.626
Don't change the topic!

04:03.626 --> 04:07.334
Are you gonna tell us
where Biggie Chen is?

04:08.584 --> 04:10.126
Tell us.

04:38.251 --> 04:39.542
You don't want to talk?

04:46.042 --> 04:47.417
Maybe your wife has the information.

04:48.292 --> 04:50.126
She lives in 16th Kalayaan,

04:51.667 --> 04:52.417
Culiat.

04:53.084 --> 04:53.751
Wait, sir.

04:54.417 --> 04:55.584
Don't be so serious.

04:55.917 --> 04:56.792
I'm just kidding.

04:59.626 --> 05:01.459
All right, I'll talk.

05:01.709 --> 05:02.834
I'll give you Biggie Chen.

05:14.042 --> 05:15.834
I don't know where he is.

05:17.459 --> 05:20.709
But I can smoke him out.

05:26.167 --> 05:29.376
I don't care who you are or where you're from.

05:29.792 --> 05:31.126
You are in my squad now.

05:31.834 --> 05:32.417
Set!

05:34.667 --> 05:37.959
Show me that you're not pathetic amateurs

05:37.959 --> 05:39.792
like they've all been saying.

05:40.334 --> 05:42.959
From now on, we are bonded until death.

05:43.626 --> 05:46.459
I told my morn I'm not dumb.

05:46.501 --> 05:49.459
I told my morn I'm not dumb.

05:49.667 --> 05:52.376
'Cause I can shoot straight

05:52.584 --> 05:55.084
with my jumbo gun.

05:59.417 --> 06:00.417
I have control!

06:00.542 --> 06:01.459
I have control!

06:01.834 --> 06:02.459
Five.

06:02.459 --> 06:03.167
Four.

06:03.209 --> 06:03.876
Three.

06:03.959 --> 06:04.542
Two.

06:04.667 --> 06:05.126
One.

06:09.334 --> 06:10.042
Room clear.

06:10.042 --> 06:10.542
Restack.

06:18.626 --> 06:19.459
Room clear!

06:19.459 --> 06:20.167
<i>Re stash!</i>

06:22.334 --> 06:23.001
Go.

06:26.834 --> 06:27.501
Room clear.

06:27.542 --> 06:28.126
Restack.

06:31.459 --> 06:32.042
Go left!

06:32.959 --> 06:34.292
While you're in my squad,

06:34.667 --> 06:36.251
you only breathe when I tell you to,

06:36.751 --> 06:38.709
blink when I tell you to.

06:39.084 --> 06:42.959
You will follow every command together as a unit.

06:46.001 --> 06:47.584
So if you want to stay in the squad,

06:47.959 --> 06:50.626
you bastards better take this seriously.

06:51.376 --> 06:53.167
I'm not keeping any dead weight.

06:54.209 --> 06:54.917
I'm no

06:55.751 --> 06:56.542
losen

06:57.417 --> 07:00.167
My prized package has arrived.

07:00.417 --> 07:03.209
Open your mouth for my surprise.

07:13.167 --> 07:14.667
To your position.

07:19.876 --> 07:21.084
Elia, take the lead!

07:22.459 --> 07:23.459
GO! Go!

07:29.292 --> 07:30.376
EHa,focus.

07:38.292 --> 07:38.959
Room clear!

07:39.167 --> 07:39.876
<i>Re stash!</i>

07:49.959 --> 07:50.709
Room clear!

07:52.126 --> 07:53.251
Regroup! Regroup!

07:53.292 --> 07:54.167
Now!

08:14.334 --> 08:15.834
Flying solo are we, Manigan?

08:15.876 --> 08:17.751
I'm sorry, sir. I got distracted.

08:17.751 --> 08:18.501
Shut up.

08:18.959 --> 08:20.334
Why did you leave your squad?

08:20.376 --> 08:21.626
I think that was the right move, sir.

08:21.626 --> 08:24.001
You think? That wasn't your sector!

08:24.001 --> 08:25.667
We have a combat SOP!

08:25.751 --> 08:28.751
Disobey me again in a real operation,

08:28.792 --> 08:30.792
and someone will die because of you.

08:33.833 --> 08:35.292
With all due respect, sir

08:36.167 --> 08:38.626
people die from following orders too.

08:42.958 --> 08:43.792
What did you say?

08:45.917 --> 08:47.251
Permission to leave, sir.

08:57.667 --> 08:58.667
That's what will happen

08:58.667 --> 09:00.167
if you don't care about the squad.

10:03.667 --> 10:06.626
Judas?

10:11.167 --> 10:12.876
Room, ten-hut!

10:16.292 --> 10:17.042
As you were.

10:21.042 --> 10:22.376
How's your back?

10:24.376 --> 10:25.126
Sir.

10:30.376 --> 10:33.042
Manigan, there's no such thing as a one-man army.

10:35.959 --> 10:37.709
I know losing your old squad was rough,

10:37.792 --> 10:40.584
but that's no excuse to disobey me.

10:48.501 --> 10:50.292
I took you in my squad

10:52.084 --> 10:53.751
even though no one else wanted to.

10:55.542 --> 10:57.917
This is my first chance to be a team leader.

10:58.334 --> 10:59.709
I will not waste this.

11:00.292 --> 11:03.501
And I hope you won't waste this chance too.

11:05.542 --> 11:07.084
So before we start,

11:09.876 --> 11:12.042
can you assure me that you will be a team player?

11:18.959 --> 11:21.667
They say when a man takes a fatal shot,
he feels nothing.

11:24.042 --> 11:25.292
Because of adrenaline.

11:27.834 --> 11:30.126
It's the body's last defense before we die.

11:31.917 --> 11:34.126
The man thinks he's fine

11:34.667 --> 11:35.709
but the truth is

11:37.626 --> 11:41.751
his body is giving him all he's got before he dies.

11:43.542 --> 11:44.459
Sir,

11:45.751 --> 11:47.042
from what I've seen,

11:47.917 --> 11:49.542
when you get shot, you fall.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.251
No adrenaline.

11:51.584 --> 11:52.834
Once you're dead, you're dead.

11:52.834 --> 11:55.542
Yes, but you still haven't answered my question.

11:56.792 --> 11:58.459
Will you follow me?

12:01.667 --> 12:02.834
Yes, sir.

12:04.459 --> 12:06.417
Everybody, 19:00! Chow!

12:06.542 --> 12:08.042
Yes, sir!

12:37.542 --> 12:38.167
Rookies,

12:39.167 --> 12:40.126
welcome to the squad.

12:51.876 --> 12:54.709
Welcome to the squad, Manigan.

12:57.626 --> 12:59.501
<i>Y atom!</i>

12:59.501 --> 13:00.792
Open your mouth.

13:08.167 --> 13:09.584
This mission is about

13:10.751 --> 13:12.417
one of the biggest players

13:13.209 --> 13:15.792
in illegal narcotics in our country.

13:17.084 --> 13:18.334
He is one of the most elusive.

13:20.001 --> 13:22.084
He frequently moves around

13:22.834 --> 13:24.542
and has ears everywhere,

13:25.251 --> 13:26.917
even in high places before.

13:27.709 --> 13:29.376
There's little info about him.

13:32.126 --> 13:33.542
That's Biggie Chen.

13:39.334 --> 13:43.417
Recently our operatives discovered a meth lab

13:43.459 --> 13:44.709
that's owned by him.

13:44.834 --> 13:45.501
But,

13:45.709 --> 13:47.667
we have yet to capture Chen.

13:47.876 --> 13:51.917
We got word that he plans to lie low overseas

13:52.167 --> 13:54.209
in the wake of our operations.

13:54.459 --> 13:56.542
So we need to act right away.

13:57.292 --> 14:00.126
This will be our inside man.

14:02.251 --> 14:03.584
They call him 'Teban'.

14:07.209 --> 14:09.542
He is a mid-level drug dealer.

14:09.751 --> 14:12.709
He is the key to capture Chen.

14:13.167 --> 14:15.459
So our mission is to lock-up Teban?

14:15.542 --> 14:16.834
Don't sweat it, Lacson.

14:16.917 --> 14:19.084
I already have him. He's now our asset.

14:19.417 --> 14:21.459
This is Agent Rudy Dela Cruz.

14:21.459 --> 14:25.834
He coordinated the clean up operations in Tondo.

14:26.709 --> 14:29.376
He will be leading this mission.

14:34.084 --> 14:35.834
At your service.

14:36.626 --> 14:38.584
Congrats. You finally got promoted.

14:39.292 --> 14:41.251
As what Agent Dela Cruz said,

14:42.167 --> 14:45.126
Teban is in our custody.

14:45.126 --> 14:47.334
He will serve as bait.

14:47.959 --> 14:49.917
And this operation happens tonight.

14:52.167 --> 14:53.167
Calm down.

14:54.834 --> 14:56.792
Calm down, assholes.

14:57.917 --> 15:00.792
You don't know anything yet so shut up.

15:00.834 --> 15:02.376
Your board, Dela Cruz. Go.

15:03.042 --> 15:03.917
Thank you, sir.

15:05.626 --> 15:06.376
Listen!

15:06.792 --> 15:12.584
The buy will be at Rajah Sulayman

15:12.626 --> 15:14.042
at 20:00 tonight.

15:14.751 --> 15:18.334
Enter two vans here.

15:22.834 --> 15:25.084
Rabbit enters from the back.

15:30.501 --> 15:33.917
Team Bravo, stand by for the bust.

15:34.667 --> 15:37.209
Team Alpha, on the perimeter.

15:37.376 --> 15:39.667
What's our assurance that the target will come?

15:40.459 --> 15:42.334
Biggie is a shrewd man.

15:42.751 --> 15:43.876
Based on my intel,

15:43.876 --> 15:47.001
he personally deals with big transactions.

15:47.626 --> 15:48.959
Remember,

15:49.292 --> 15:50.709
we can hear you

15:50.751 --> 15:52.084
and you can hear us.

15:53.126 --> 15:53.667
Okay.

15:53.959 --> 15:55.001
All set.

15:55.542 --> 15:57.251
Got something bigger?

15:58.042 --> 16:00.251
I've got headphones. Wanna borrow them?

16:01.001 --> 16:02.167
Questions?

16:02.334 --> 16:02.917
None?

16:03.167 --> 16:03.792
Move out.

16:04.334 --> 16:04.959
Now.

17:31.917 --> 17:36.042
Lacson, don't get too close or you're toast.

17:36.209 --> 17:38.959
Don't tell me what to do. I know what I'm doing.

17:53.792 --> 17:54.667
Hello?

17:54.959 --> 17:57.376
Yeah, I can't tomorrow.

17:57.376 --> 17:59.292
Just reschedule.

17:59.501 --> 18:00.834
I don't have money.

18:01.417 --> 18:02.709
Go away.

18:03.001 --> 18:06.376
- Please, sir.
- Spare change will do.

18:08.584 --> 18:10.251
Come on, sir!

18:10.459 --> 18:12.542
My pockets are empty. Stop badgering.

18:12.626 --> 18:13.751
Go. Stay away.

18:14.001 --> 18:15.876
I said go.

18:33.334 --> 18:35.959
Relax. It's just a roving patrol.

18:59.209 --> 19:00.917
Recover the asset!

19:02.417 --> 19:03.751
Fuck. I'm gonna get killed.

19:03.876 --> 19:06.667
I can't align the asset. I can't see the rabbit.

19:06.667 --> 19:08.209
I'm gonna die.

19:08.959 --> 19:10.751
Recover the asset. Recover him!

19:19.584 --> 19:21.917
Don't panic. I can still see you.

19:36.334 --> 19:37.209
Hello?

19:37.626 --> 19:38.417
You're early.

19:38.501 --> 19:39.167
Biggie?

19:40.626 --> 19:41.792
Yes, I've been waiting.

19:41.792 --> 19:43.459
Sorry, but I'm not coming.

19:43.459 --> 19:44.126
What?

19:44.459 --> 19:45.334
Why?

19:45.917 --> 19:46.959
Something's UP-

19:47.292 --> 19:48.417
You got company?

19:48.417 --> 19:49.792
No way!

19:50.417 --> 19:52.251
Then why do you sound nervous?

19:52.292 --> 19:54.917
I swear, I'm not nervous.

19:55.209 --> 19:58.376
Did I ever lie to you, boss?
I've been loyal ever since.

19:58.917 --> 20:01.251
Boss, I'm already here.

20:01.792 --> 20:05.126
I have the money, all of it. Let's do this!

20:14.709 --> 20:15.584
Okay.

20:20.001 --> 20:21.959
Guys, we're changing location.

20:23.459 --> 20:25.042
Seven, follow the rabbit.

20:25.042 --> 20:26.876
Check where he is heading.

20:43.751 --> 20:47.084
The plan has changed.
We're going into Gracia ni Maria.

20:47.417 --> 20:48.834
Bravo, hand over your gear.

20:49.542 --> 20:53.042
Team Alpha, we won't move until
agent Dela Cruz says the call sign.

20:53.251 --> 20:54.417
"Ecstasy"

20:54.584 --> 20:55.584
What about backup, sir?

20:55.751 --> 20:58.417
We're going in quietly. We can't risk alerting Biggie.

20:58.834 --> 21:00.667
We have backup, but they're on call.

21:02.209 --> 21:03.042
On call?

21:03.501 --> 21:04.667
Yes, on call.

21:05.167 --> 21:06.167
On my call.

21:06.959 --> 21:07.834
Got a problem?

21:11.501 --> 21:12.751
All right! Let's move!

21:12.834 --> 21:13.876
Yes sir!

21:15.626 --> 21:17.959
You had dinner yet?

21:17.959 --> 21:20.292
Later, morn. I'm in the middle of a game.

21:20.292 --> 21:20.792
What?

21:20.792 --> 21:22.584
I'm still playing.

21:23.001 --> 21:24.792
Talk to your son.
He won't eat.

21:24.792 --> 21:25.667
Just let him be.

21:25.667 --> 21:27.417
He's a man. He won't die.

21:27.626 --> 21:28.667
Are you kidding me?

21:28.667 --> 21:30.584
Man or not, if you don't eat you'll die.

21:30.626 --> 21:32.251
Sir, doesn't this look like a suicide mission?

21:32.292 --> 21:35.001
Do you really trust his plan?

21:36.959 --> 21:38.042
Not one hundred percent,

21:38.459 --> 21:39.959
but this is our duty.

21:40.626 --> 21:42.126
I know you have something to prove.

21:42.126 --> 21:43.084
We're the same.

21:44.001 --> 21:45.292
You're not jinxed.

21:47.334 --> 21:50.001
What happened to your old squad wasn't your fault.

21:50.001 --> 21:52.584
And whatever happens tonight will not be your fault.

21:53.709 --> 21:54.959
This is your squad now.

21:56.042 --> 21:57.709
Focus on the mission.

21:57.709 --> 21:59.376
You'll be the last man later.

21:59.376 --> 22:00.376
Protect your team.

22:04.001 --> 22:05.167
You Okay?

22:05.626 --> 22:06.876
Scared?

22:07.626 --> 22:09.667
Why? Aren't you scared?

22:11.126 --> 22:11.917
Not anymore.

22:13.501 --> 22:14.542
I'm used to it.

22:15.542 --> 22:16.667
What's that thing?

22:16.709 --> 22:17.876
This?

22:18.459 --> 22:19.709
My lucky charm.

22:20.292 --> 22:23.959
As long as I have this, I'm invincible.

22:25.876 --> 22:26.917
Keep calm.

22:27.376 --> 22:29.167
Don't get too excited.

22:30.792 --> 22:33.626
You don't know what's
in the district of Gracia ni Maria.

22:35.084 --> 22:38.042
It's like a jungle out there,

22:38.376 --> 22:40.626
a playground of both sinners and saints.

22:47.251 --> 22:49.542
He will save you from peril,

22:49.751 --> 22:51.792
from the mouth of a trap.

22:52.126 --> 22:55.626
And no matter how strong the enemy,
you will prevail.

22:56.501 --> 23:00.542
He will shelter you under His wings.

23:00.959 --> 23:05.459
You are my Lord, the Lord that I trust.

25:15.709 --> 25:18.417
Boss Chongki, we're here.

25:19.959 --> 25:21.584
Okay, we'll look for him.

27:07.959 --> 27:08.792
Wait here.

27:09.001 --> 27:09.959
Here?

27:10.917 --> 27:11.917
Got a problem?

27:13.084 --> 27:14.126
Chongkfl

27:14.126 --> 27:14.917
Teban.

27:19.334 --> 27:20.959
Been a long a time, Chongki.

27:27.126 --> 27:28.667
That's a big entourage.

27:29.876 --> 27:31.626
Just extra porters, Chongki!

27:32.209 --> 27:32.917
Okay.

27:33.292 --> 27:34.584
Spread your legs.

27:38.001 --> 27:41.042
Wow. You've gone big time, Chongki.

27:42.876 --> 27:44.001
Hey, boss!

27:44.292 --> 27:45.542
Do you have to check there?

27:46.001 --> 27:47.251
Don't move.

27:47.292 --> 27:48.751
Are you hiding something?

27:50.126 --> 27:51.584
Of course not.

27:52.876 --> 27:53.542
Okay.

27:54.292 --> 27:54.876
Clear.

27:58.876 --> 27:59.626
No need.

28:00.417 --> 28:01.209
We're armed.

28:04.459 --> 28:05.292
Bring them out.

28:05.459 --> 28:06.626
Surrender them to Jet.

28:07.584 --> 28:10.292
Is this a staring contest or what?

28:11.376 --> 28:12.334
Hand them over.

28:13.376 --> 28:14.584
Come on!

28:17.584 --> 28:18.626
If we refuse?

28:20.876 --> 28:23.626
You got a death wish?

28:24.417 --> 28:25.001
Teban,

28:25.709 --> 28:27.542
you know the rules here.

28:28.501 --> 28:30.751
Is he trying to be funny?

28:30.792 --> 28:31.251
No.

28:31.584 --> 28:32.626
Friends, friends!

28:33.792 --> 28:34.917
Relax.

28:36.251 --> 28:36.792
Come on.

28:37.084 --> 28:38.751
- Alda, return.
- You'll get them back.

28:38.751 --> 28:40.001
Just hand them over.

28:46.501 --> 28:47.917
Come on, it's getting cold.

28:57.751 --> 28:58.584
Let's go.

29:22.584 --> 29:23.084
Hey!

29:23.084 --> 29:24.084
Don't!

29:24.292 --> 29:25.334
Who are you?

29:29.792 --> 29:31.251
I won't rat you out!

29:34.251 --> 29:35.251
Please don't.

29:55.292 --> 29:57.292
This place is like a maze.

29:58.001 --> 29:59.167
How much farther?

29:59.876 --> 30:02.334
We've gone past this red house three times!

30:04.667 --> 30:05.251
Teban,

30:05.251 --> 30:06.417
tell your boy to shut up.

30:07.917 --> 30:09.501
What? We're not allowed to talk?

30:10.834 --> 30:12.167
This time we take a right.

30:13.292 --> 30:14.042
Hey!

30:14.292 --> 30:15.209
Where are you going?

30:16.626 --> 30:18.917
It's on the next corner.

30:18.917 --> 30:21.334
Be careful. It's easy to get lost.

30:35.251 --> 30:38.751
Smells good. Can I have some now?

30:38.876 --> 30:40.542
Just wait a little more.

30:40.667 --> 30:42.292
Morn, what's for dinner?

30:42.417 --> 30:43.417
Noodles.

30:43.667 --> 30:45.084
I'll have the chicken flavor please.

30:45.376 --> 30:49.376
Sure. Can you go buy some soda?

30:49.459 --> 30:50.876
Get money from my wallet.

30:50.959 --> 30:53.626
Can I buy snacks too?

30:55.501 --> 30:56.709
What the fuck!

30:56.709 --> 30:58.167
Where have you been?

30:59.209 --> 31:01.126
I've been working!

31:01.126 --> 31:03.417
You reek of alcohol!

31:03.542 --> 31:05.292
You're such a liar!

31:10.084 --> 31:10.917
Hey,Teban!

31:10.917 --> 31:12.334
Tell your boys to walk faster!

31:12.417 --> 31:14.001
Fucking slowpokes.

31:14.167 --> 31:16.917
Hurry it up, skinhead!

31:28.626 --> 31:31.626
Jenny, can you take your brother please?

32:13.334 --> 32:14.834
Why are you here?

32:15.459 --> 32:16.209
Let me go.

32:16.209 --> 32:17.126
- Let me go.
- Just come with us.

32:18.542 --> 32:19.709
We'll send you home later!

32:19.709 --> 32:21.292
Mom's gonna look for me!

32:46.251 --> 32:49.042
Judiel! My child!

33:33.376 --> 33:34.542
Boss Chongki!

33:35.292 --> 33:36.334
Where's boss Biggie?

33:37.084 --> 33:37.917
He's upstairs.

33:38.126 --> 33:39.126
Call him.

33:53.542 --> 33:55.292
Hey,Teban.

33:55.959 --> 33:56.792
How are you?

33:57.209 --> 33:59.292
Still breathing.

33:59.501 --> 34:01.001
You suddenly disappeared.

34:01.792 --> 34:03.376
Heard the cops caught you.

34:04.084 --> 34:06.667
No way! They wouldn't dare.

34:07.001 --> 34:07.792
I see.

34:17.167 --> 34:18.958
Hey! Where are you going?

34:44.501 --> 34:46.417
Why rush this deal?

34:46.417 --> 34:48.167
Cops are still hot on your area.

34:48.333 --> 34:51.458
Business can't wait, boss.

34:52.083 --> 34:53.917
This bag feels light.

34:57.001 --> 35:00.792
I swear, boss. It's all there.

35:02.376 --> 35:04.292
So who are these guys?

35:05.501 --> 35:07.209
Our client sent them.

35:09.626 --> 35:10.959
Have we met before?

35:12.792 --> 35:13.959
Doubt it, sir.

35:14.001 --> 35:15.042
Call the backup.

35:15.292 --> 35:15.792
Yes, sir.

35:15.792 --> 35:16.626
Are you sure?

35:16.751 --> 35:17.959
You look very familiar.

35:22.834 --> 35:24.126
No signal.

35:25.001 --> 35:26.334
They've got a signal jammer.

35:26.376 --> 35:28.042
Quit playing billiards!

35:28.084 --> 35:29.334
Don't be fucking rude!

35:30.292 --> 35:31.334
Sorry, boss.

35:34.126 --> 35:35.126
What are we waiting for?

35:35.417 --> 35:36.376
Let's do it.

35:37.626 --> 35:38.584
Bring it here.

35:39.084 --> 35:41.501
Elia, just keep on calling.

36:30.376 --> 36:31.126
Shit head!

36:43.709 --> 36:45.209
I'll have some of that.

36:46.501 --> 36:48.709
W33' to 90, boss!

36:49.376 --> 36:51.501
You're too close! We're not even close!

36:51.792 --> 36:52.876
Boss, we'll stay here!

36:53.001 --> 36:54.084
Fine!

37:06.626 --> 37:08.667
You're flirting like crazy.

37:08.667 --> 37:09.667
She's a dude!

37:10.042 --> 37:10.751
You there,

37:11.042 --> 37:12.001
check the money.

37:12.626 --> 37:14.167
Boss Chongki, it's Cocky.

37:15.667 --> 37:17.126
Excuse me, boss.

37:40.126 --> 37:40.792
Sir!

37:41.417 --> 37:42.334
Let's pullout.

37:42.959 --> 37:43.792
Stand down.

37:43.792 --> 37:45.626
Let's wait for Bravo's exit.

37:55.751 --> 37:56.626
What is it, Chongki?

37:56.626 --> 37:57.792
What did Cocky say?

37:58.876 --> 38:00.292
Got a minute, boss?

38:01.251 --> 38:02.251
Excuse us.

38:17.459 --> 38:19.292
Here it is.

38:19.667 --> 38:21.001
That's pure stuff.

38:22.042 --> 38:24.876
All right boss, we'll take it.

38:27.376 --> 38:28.751
Aren't you gonna check?

38:29.709 --> 38:31.334
What kind of businessmen are you?

38:31.917 --> 38:34.292
No need, boss. I trust you.

38:36.001 --> 38:37.376
Are you in a hurry?

38:38.876 --> 38:40.126
Stay a while.

38:40.876 --> 38:42.876
Enjoy the best of Gracia

38:43.001 --> 38:45.626
Why not invite our guests outside?

38:46.834 --> 38:48.626
You're all staying here for good.

38:50.501 --> 38:51.209
Biggie!

38:53.334 --> 38:54.417
This is a set-up!

38:54.667 --> 38:56.042
Alpha, pullout!

38:56.084 --> 38:58.459
GO! Go!

38:58.459 --> 38:59.876
Fucking shit! There's cops!

39:38.126 --> 39:39.334
Go back! Move!

39:42.001 --> 39:44.584
Thanks, Judas.

39:44.667 --> 39:46.126
You delivered as always.

39:46.167 --> 39:47.626
Did you hear that?

39:48.167 --> 39:49.792
Come on! Let's go!

40:14.626 --> 40:16.209
Go back! We're trapped!

40:30.626 --> 40:31.542
Hizon!

40:34.917 --> 40:36.126
Get him!

40:36.834 --> 40:37.834
Hizon!

41:06.876 --> 41:08.001
Motherfucker!

41:51.501 --> 41:54.667
Agents!

41:55.084 --> 41:56.459
Listen up!

41:57.292 --> 42:01.917
Listen as I take your friend's life!

42:04.876 --> 42:05.917
Listen well!

42:08.417 --> 42:09.334
Remember,

42:09.709 --> 42:12.917
his blood is on your hands not mine!

42:13.834 --> 42:14.959
Hear this!

42:39.667 --> 42:40.376
Santos!

42:56.126 --> 42:56.667
So,

42:57.876 --> 42:59.376
listen closely.

42:59.626 --> 43:00.751
Here's our deal.

43:02.042 --> 43:03.251
If you surrender,

43:04.417 --> 43:06.417
none of you will get hurt.

43:07.542 --> 43:09.667
You know, I sympathize with you.

43:10.667 --> 43:13.584
You're simply doing your jobs.

43:14.542 --> 43:15.459
However-

43:16.542 --> 43:17.751
What is that?

43:18.542 --> 43:19.292
Who's that?

43:21.542 --> 43:21.917
Hey!

43:22.251 --> 43:22.751
YOu!

43:23.334 --> 43:23.917
Come here.

43:24.334 --> 43:25.001
Stay put.

43:25.334 --> 43:26.209
Come here!

43:26.251 --> 43:27.209
- Come here!
- Elmer!

43:27.209 --> 43:29.876
Chongki, please let it go.

43:29.917 --> 43:31.209
Turn off your alarm!

43:34.876 --> 43:35.876
Shut it Off.

43:39.417 --> 43:40.709
You piece of shit!

43:41.042 --> 43:41.751
Fuck you!

43:43.792 --> 43:44.584
Hey!

43:45.667 --> 43:46.792
Let's do it this way,

43:47.709 --> 43:49.667
I'll count to five.

43:50.584 --> 43:51.959
If you surrender,

43:52.792 --> 43:54.251
this old man stays alive.

43:55.792 --> 43:56.792
If not,

43:57.376 --> 43:58.334
I'm sorry.

44:01.459 --> 44:02.584
Listen!

44:04.959 --> 44:05.792
One.

44:14.626 --> 44:15.626
Two.

44:16.209 --> 44:18.667
You've already deserted your teammate.

44:18.834 --> 44:20.084
This man, too?

44:21.501 --> 44:22.376
Three.

44:26.667 --> 44:27.584
Four.

44:34.209 --> 44:35.751
I'm sorry, old man.

44:35.917 --> 44:37.917
My hands are clean here.

44:40.626 --> 44:41.626
Chongkfl

44:41.626 --> 44:42.667
Chongki, no!

44:47.751 --> 44:48.417
Who's there?

44:49.251 --> 44:50.667
Boss, it's us.

44:57.167 --> 44:58.292
What happened?

44:58.292 --> 44:59.334
They're gone, boss.

45:04.792 --> 45:05.834
Find them.

45:05.834 --> 45:06.876
Okay, boss.

45:06.876 --> 45:08.251
I'm sorry for your loss.

45:15.209 --> 45:16.917
Elmer!

45:21.626 --> 45:23.042
God damn it!

45:24.709 --> 45:26.167
What happened?

45:26.209 --> 45:28.001
We're always caught in the crossfire.

45:28.042 --> 45:31.001
Judiel isn't even buried yet!

45:39.459 --> 45:41.376
It's going to be a long night.

45:42.834 --> 45:43.626
<i>Let' s gm!</i>

45:44.167 --> 45:45.626
Let's hunt them down!

46:02.376 --> 46:02.917
Clear.

46:05.792 --> 46:06.876
Let's stay put.

46:07.667 --> 46:09.792
Sir, we need to leave.

46:09.792 --> 46:11.126
We need a plan.

46:13.042 --> 46:14.084
Just let me think.

46:26.959 --> 46:28.292
How can we get out of here?

46:28.709 --> 46:30.084
Bravo team needs us.

46:30.667 --> 46:32.001
Yatco, they're dead.

46:32.334 --> 46:34.209
How can you be sure?

46:34.209 --> 46:37.001
We can't get out without backup.

46:37.667 --> 46:38.209
Sir!

46:38.626 --> 46:39.751
This was a setup.

46:40.209 --> 46:42.167
It's too dangerous to stay.

46:42.459 --> 46:44.751
We can't leave Bravo behind.

46:44.792 --> 46:45.542
<i>Y atom!</i>

46:50.334 --> 46:51.584
We're getting out.

46:52.251 --> 46:54.292
We don't know if we even have backup.

46:54.751 --> 46:56.292
Let's find a way out.

46:57.084 --> 46:57.834
Save your bullets.

47:03.834 --> 47:04.834
GO! Go!

47:11.917 --> 47:12.917
Shoot them!

47:13.084 --> 47:14.501
Elia!

47:19.751 --> 47:20.792
Surround them!

47:21.251 --> 47:22.334
Agents! Suck my dick!

47:24.084 --> 47:24.751
Stoppage!

47:24.751 --> 47:25.751
Cover me!

47:29.126 --> 47:30.376
You little shits!

47:33.417 --> 47:34.959
You're dead meat!

47:35.709 --> 47:36.709
Change mag!

47:41.876 --> 47:43.292
Change mag!

47:51.251 --> 47:52.251
Stoppage!

48:04.167 --> 48:05.167
Change mag!

48:08.209 --> 48:09.209
Change mag!

48:11.542 --> 48:13.209
Stoppage! Cover me!

48:15.917 --> 48:16.501
Santos!

48:17.001 --> 48:17.501
Calm down!

48:17.501 --> 48:18.376
Don't waste your bullets!

48:18.417 --> 48:19.084
<i>Let' s gm!</i>

48:19.167 --> 48:19.709
Manigan!

48:19.834 --> 48:21.042
Elia! Santos!

48:21.251 --> 48:21.959
<i>Y atom!</i>

48:32.167 --> 48:32.959
Manigan, move!

49:58.501 --> 49:59.167
Don't!

50:26.667 --> 50:27.459
Santos!

50:33.209 --> 50:34.167
Santos.

50:57.626 --> 50:58.251
Come on!

50:58.626 --> 50:59.459
I'm right behind you.

51:15.584 --> 51:17.001
Alpha, let's get out of here!

51:17.334 --> 51:18.501
Who are these people?

51:18.542 --> 51:19.251
What about Santos?

51:19.334 --> 51:19.959
Manigan!

51:20.084 --> 51:21.584
We can't leave Santos!

51:53.959 --> 51:55.667
Don't be stubborn! Come on!

51:58.417 --> 51:59.126
<i>Let' s gm!</i>

51:59.917 --> 52:00.459
Gelo!

52:02.709 --> 52:03.751
Hurry up!

52:05.167 --> 52:06.209
Rico, come on!

52:16.126 --> 52:16.917
Manigan!

52:17.584 --> 52:18.167
Get inside.

52:28.626 --> 52:29.417
Judas.

52:33.709 --> 52:34.376
Dela Cruz!

52:37.584 --> 52:38.917
Thank God you're still alive.

52:39.001 --> 52:39.751
What happened?

52:41.459 --> 52:42.334
You heard, right?

52:43.126 --> 52:43.834
Bravo Team?

52:44.292 --> 52:46.251
We got separated.

52:46.501 --> 52:47.376
You weren't shot?

52:48.084 --> 52:49.709
Luckily, just my lapel.

52:50.001 --> 52:50.917
Lucky, huh?

52:51.751 --> 52:52.667
Got an extra gun?

52:52.959 --> 52:53.501
Sorry.

52:54.209 --> 52:55.626
We're almost out of bullets.

52:56.459 --> 53:00.292
Let's go back to the exchange site.
We can get guns and bullets there.

53:00.376 --> 53:02.042
I need to find my team too.

53:02.542 --> 53:04.959
Wait. It's too dangerous.
We need to call for backup.

53:06.251 --> 53:07.251
I already called.

53:07.417 --> 53:08.126
They're coming.

53:09.501 --> 53:10.584
Thank God!

53:12.042 --> 53:13.959
Come on! We can't stay here!

53:19.209 --> 53:21.501
We have to find all of them.

53:22.459 --> 53:25.001
Where the hell are those motherfuckers?

53:25.501 --> 53:27.501
We'll have to split up.

53:28.251 --> 53:29.751
Let's put an end to this.

55:10.417 --> 55:11.917
Sir!

55:14.584 --> 55:15.667
I'm okay. I wasn't shot.

55:15.667 --> 55:16.626
- I'm okay. I wasn't shot.
- What happened?

55:16.709 --> 55:18.876
I just smeared her blood on me.

55:18.876 --> 55:20.584
- You weren't shot?
- No I'm fine.

55:21.542 --> 55:22.584
You set us up!

55:22.626 --> 55:23.042
Hey!

55:24.084 --> 55:24.834
Fuck you.

55:24.876 --> 55:26.417
What set up?

55:27.167 --> 55:28.876
- I'm not that smart! Quit hitting me!
- Manigan, what are you doing?

55:29.084 --> 55:30.626
Teban didn't set us up.

55:31.584 --> 55:33.417
Who then? Me?
Fuck you, Manigan!

55:33.542 --> 55:35.251
You made sure we had no backup.

55:35.667 --> 55:36.709
He called already!

55:37.042 --> 55:38.001
Without signal?

55:38.834 --> 55:39.917
So it was you!

55:42.251 --> 55:43.209
You trapped us

55:43.209 --> 55:45.126
just like you did to my old squad!

55:45.417 --> 55:47.084
You still blame me for that?

55:47.751 --> 55:48.459
Manigan.

55:50.917 --> 55:52.126
Put your gun down.

55:54.459 --> 55:55.501
Admit it.

55:55.751 --> 55:56.792
You are Judas!

55:56.834 --> 55:58.001
He sure is!

55:58.292 --> 56:00.042
You think I'd betray my own team?

56:00.126 --> 56:01.167
You weren't shot!

56:01.209 --> 56:03.334
- So?
- While your men were gunned down?

56:04.167 --> 56:04.417
You have a deal with Biggie, don't you?

56:04.459 --> 56:05.959
- You have a deal with Biggie, don't you?
- Do you believe this?

56:05.959 --> 56:07.167
That's why you brought us here.

56:07.417 --> 56:08.376
I bet.

56:09.167 --> 56:09.667
What?

56:10.167 --> 56:11.709
Is that your motive?

56:11.834 --> 56:14.167
Son of a bitch! I'll have you all arrested!

56:15.001 --> 56:15.709
Dela Cruz!

56:22.292 --> 56:23.167
Admit it!

56:24.084 --> 56:24.751
No!

56:25.584 --> 56:27.167
I want to capture Biggie.

56:31.209 --> 56:32.626
Elia, Lacson.

56:35.751 --> 56:36.501
Manigan.

56:45.917 --> 56:47.376
Yeah, cuff him.

56:47.917 --> 56:50.292
Why me? He's the criminal.

56:51.917 --> 56:53.292
Who's the Judas now?

57:39.876 --> 57:42.167
Elia, go that way.

58:14.001 --> 58:14.751
Clear.

58:15.417 --> 58:16.167
Clear.

58:17.459 --> 58:18.209
Clear.

58:28.084 --> 58:29.292
I know we don't get along

58:29.292 --> 58:30.334
but this isn't right.

58:30.417 --> 58:31.001
Sir.

58:31.251 --> 58:32.459
They're coming.

58:40.167 --> 58:41.667
Have you found them?

58:41.709 --> 58:42.792
Not yet.

58:42.792 --> 58:44.167
Where are those assholes?

59:26.376 --> 59:27.209
<i>Let' s gm!</i>

59:27.501 --> 59:28.167
GO! Go!

59:38.709 --> 59:39.751
Manigan.

59:40.084 --> 59:41.167
They're inside!

01:00:10.334 --> 01:00:10.959
Move!

01:00:12.751 --> 01:00:13.751
You motherfuckers!

01:00:14.042 --> 01:00:15.001
Open the door!

01:00:16.459 --> 01:00:18.876
Yatco! Out of the way!

01:01:08.959 --> 01:01:10.584
Run!

01:01:18.209 --> 01:01:19.542
Hurry!

01:01:33.251 --> 01:01:34.292
Climb up!

01:01:34.542 --> 01:01:35.876
Catch them!

01:01:36.084 --> 01:01:36.584
YOu!

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:39.251
Go back! Go to the other side!

01:01:48.001 --> 01:01:48.542
Hurry up!

01:01:48.542 --> 01:01:50.251
I need momentum!

01:01:51.751 --> 01:01:52.501
Faster!

01:02:20.626 --> 01:02:25.209
Let us sleep you bastards!

01:02:53.126 --> 01:02:54.084
Go back for Elia!

01:02:54.209 --> 01:02:55.501
Yatco, Manigan!

01:02:55.709 --> 01:02:57.501
Lacson! Look for an exit!

01:03:11.876 --> 01:03:13.584
- Come on!
- But I'm cuffed!

01:03:14.251 --> 01:03:15.042
Just jump!

01:03:15.042 --> 01:03:16.126
Son of a bitch!

01:03:17.667 --> 01:03:19.126
Easy, right?

01:03:19.126 --> 01:03:20.251
Fuck you!

01:03:26.042 --> 01:03:27.292
Get away from him!

01:03:29.042 --> 01:03:30.542
Finish him off!

01:03:37.542 --> 01:03:39.376
Kill him!

01:04:25.501 --> 01:04:26.501
Fuck you!

01:04:29.667 --> 01:04:30.959
Manigan, come on!

01:04:31.042 --> 01:04:32.584
What about Elia?

01:05:09.959 --> 01:05:11.292
You son of a bitch!

01:05:16.626 --> 01:05:18.292
Fuck you!

01:05:24.459 --> 01:05:26.501
You fucking monster!

01:05:30.917 --> 01:05:32.042
Piece of shit!

01:05:33.126 --> 01:05:34.084
Son of a bitch!

01:05:45.292 --> 01:05:46.709
Annoying bitch!

01:06:38.167 --> 01:06:38.876
Manigan?

01:06:39.792 --> 01:06:40.751
Yatco?

01:06:41.709 --> 01:06:43.167
No response. Fuck!

01:06:45.959 --> 01:06:48.167
I hope authorities respond to the noise.

01:06:48.167 --> 01:06:49.376
You wish.

01:06:49.584 --> 01:06:51.292
We don't have bullets left, Yatco.

01:06:51.417 --> 01:06:52.334
Sir?

01:06:55.917 --> 01:06:56.959
We're the police.

01:06:56.959 --> 01:06:58.334
We need assistance!

01:06:58.334 --> 01:06:59.376
Let us in!

01:06:59.376 --> 01:07:02.417
You think we wanna get involved
with you scumbags?

01:07:06.709 --> 01:07:08.542
Have you heard from Jet?

01:07:09.542 --> 01:07:11.167
They haven't found them yet, sir.

01:07:36.751 --> 01:07:38.376
We need to call for backup.

01:07:38.501 --> 01:07:39.292
Get out of here!

01:07:39.584 --> 01:07:41.084
Don't involve us!

01:07:45.876 --> 01:07:47.417
It's not that we don't want to help,

01:07:47.459 --> 01:07:49.459
but we can't do anything.

01:07:49.751 --> 01:07:50.751
Go inside.

01:07:51.542 --> 01:07:53.751
We need to call for rescue.

01:08:02.751 --> 01:08:04.001
I can let you use this,

01:08:04.001 --> 01:08:05.126
but in situations like this,

01:08:05.542 --> 01:08:06.917
I'm sure there's no signal.

01:08:10.876 --> 01:08:12.292
How can we get out?

01:08:17.626 --> 01:08:20.251
If I help you, can you guarantee our safety?

01:08:21.334 --> 01:08:22.084
I'm sorry.

01:08:27.626 --> 01:08:28.459
Berns.

01:08:29.042 --> 01:08:30.001
What's the plan?

01:08:30.626 --> 01:08:32.251
You can barely walk.

01:08:34.834 --> 01:08:37.626
Make a call, team leader. That's your job.

01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:50.709
Berns!

01:08:58.959 --> 01:08:59.417
There.

01:09:01.167 --> 01:09:02.042
That's our exit.

01:09:02.334 --> 01:09:04.126
Are you sure about that?

01:09:04.959 --> 01:09:05.459
Teban,

01:09:05.876 --> 01:09:07.376
guard our hostage.

01:09:07.667 --> 01:09:08.876
Just trust me, come on.

01:09:09.167 --> 01:09:12.626
Fuck you. I own your ass now!

01:09:23.834 --> 01:09:24.834
They're here!

01:09:24.834 --> 01:09:26.001
Yeah, that's them!

01:09:29.042 --> 01:09:30.417
You killed our husbands!

01:09:30.417 --> 01:09:31.626
My son was innocent!

01:09:31.751 --> 01:09:32.876
Leave us alone!

01:09:33.209 --> 01:09:35.001
We just want to get out.

01:09:35.167 --> 01:09:36.001
Shameless bastards!

01:09:36.626 --> 01:09:38.751
You bring nothing but trouble for us!

01:09:39.001 --> 01:09:40.251
We're minding our own business here.

01:09:40.376 --> 01:09:41.709
Can't you let us be?

01:09:44.084 --> 01:09:44.834
Worthless scum!

01:09:46.542 --> 01:09:47.542
Just let us go!

01:09:48.417 --> 01:09:49.417
What about us?

01:09:49.667 --> 01:09:51.334
You ruined our families!

01:09:59.876 --> 01:10:00.792
Get ready.

01:10:01.959 --> 01:10:03.167
This will get ugly.

01:10:03.917 --> 01:10:05.417
I know.

01:11:39.167 --> 01:11:41.001
I swear, I will kill you.

01:12:02.292 --> 01:12:03.376
Manigan!

01:12:51.126 --> 01:12:51.709
Yatco?

01:12:54.792 --> 01:12:55.542
<i>Y atom!</i>

01:13:07.667 --> 01:13:08.542
Rico!

01:13:10.126 --> 01:13:11.126
Rico!

01:13:13.876 --> 01:13:14.834
Fuck.

01:13:50.042 --> 01:13:51.042
Go home

01:14:26.084 --> 01:14:26.876
Manigan!

01:14:29.126 --> 01:14:29.834
<i>Y atom!</i>

01:14:30.501 --> 01:14:31.667
That's our way out.

01:14:31.751 --> 01:14:32.501
Hurry, Yatco.

01:14:32.917 --> 01:14:35.834
Help me bring him there.

01:14:36.209 --> 01:14:37.251
Go on without me.

01:14:37.376 --> 01:14:38.501
I'm not leaving you!

01:14:39.792 --> 01:14:41.251
Don't force it.

01:14:41.501 --> 01:14:42.501
It's too high.

01:14:43.917 --> 01:14:44.501
Wait.

01:14:44.834 --> 01:14:46.292
One, two.

01:15:47.792 --> 01:15:49.001
Dela Cruz!

01:15:50.792 --> 01:15:52.709
We're going that way.

01:15:54.667 --> 01:15:55.667
Get it?

01:16:31.001 --> 01:16:31.667
Berns!

01:16:33.542 --> 01:16:34.376
Aida!

01:16:47.876 --> 01:16:49.334
Judas!

01:16:50.626 --> 01:16:51.834
Go! Hurry!

01:16:53.167 --> 01:16:54.084
Judas!

01:17:01.292 --> 01:17:02.292
Hey!

01:17:11.917 --> 01:17:14.376
Capture Dela Cruz.

01:17:15.167 --> 01:17:16.001
Leave me.

01:17:17.167 --> 01:17:17.792
But, sir.

01:17:17.917 --> 01:17:18.876
Don't be stubborn.

01:17:19.126 --> 01:17:20.126
That's an order!

01:17:21.959 --> 01:17:22.959
Yes, sir.

01:17:28.292 --> 01:17:29.834
If anyone can hear me,

01:17:29.959 --> 01:17:30.917
we are the police!

01:17:31.167 --> 01:17:32.334
There's been a shoot-out!

01:17:32.376 --> 01:17:34.292
Call 911!

01:17:36.542 --> 01:17:37.209
Sir.

01:18:06.834 --> 01:18:08.584
Catch him! Hurry!

01:18:13.501 --> 01:18:15.417
- Where do you think you're going?
- Not too loud!

01:18:15.584 --> 01:18:16.542
You son of a bitch!

01:18:16.709 --> 01:18:17.751
<i>Miss! Miss!</i>

01:18:19.459 --> 01:18:20.876
It's dangerous here.

01:18:21.376 --> 01:18:22.917
I know a place.

01:18:23.542 --> 01:18:24.209
<i>Miss.</i>

01:18:24.376 --> 01:18:26.042
You're going to believe that pusher?

01:18:27.084 --> 01:18:28.751
Where will I go if I betray you?

01:18:29.751 --> 01:18:30.917
You're the Judas here.

01:18:31.042 --> 01:18:32.042
Where?

01:18:32.209 --> 01:18:32.959
Hold on.

01:18:34.792 --> 01:18:35.667
Follow me.

01:18:45.459 --> 01:18:46.251
Manigan!

01:18:47.001 --> 01:18:49.751
Are you gonna play innocent again, Judas?

01:18:50.292 --> 01:18:52.167
Fuck this. I told you a million times!

01:18:52.376 --> 01:18:54.126
I'm not Judas!

01:18:54.417 --> 01:18:56.126
Then why did you run?

01:18:56.792 --> 01:18:57.917
That's his style.

01:18:58.584 --> 01:18:59.292
Hello?

01:18:59.709 --> 01:19:01.126
You deserve that.

01:19:01.542 --> 01:19:04.167
You let my squad die back in Santa Clara.

01:19:04.209 --> 01:19:06.501
I had nothing to do with that then.

01:19:06.584 --> 01:19:08.001
Even more so now!

01:19:08.251 --> 01:19:10.417
That was you? Tough luck.

01:19:10.584 --> 01:19:11.709
She's jinxed alright!

01:19:12.376 --> 01:19:14.584
And you're Boss Kiko's whore.

01:19:14.584 --> 01:19:15.584
Fuck you!

01:19:15.667 --> 01:19:17.209
Don't deny it.

01:19:17.209 --> 01:19:19.334
You love extorting 'ransom' from him.

01:19:19.334 --> 01:19:22.209
A hundred thousand per bust.

01:19:22.501 --> 01:19:23.876
You do it all the time!

01:19:25.876 --> 01:19:27.001
Believe me, Manigan.

01:19:27.917 --> 01:19:30.126
I didn't plan for your squad to die.

01:19:30.417 --> 01:19:32.292
Boss Kiko and I had a deal.

01:19:33.417 --> 01:19:35.792
We were all gonna come out alive.

01:19:35.792 --> 01:19:36.751
Without any trouble.

01:19:39.667 --> 01:19:41.376
If you only listened to my orders.

01:19:41.417 --> 01:19:42.667
But you didn't.

01:19:42.834 --> 01:19:44.501
We already had Kiko.

01:19:44.501 --> 01:19:46.376
That's when you told us to pullout.

01:19:46.876 --> 01:19:49.292
You used us in your scheme.

01:19:49.584 --> 01:19:50.626
You really are the Judas!

01:19:52.876 --> 01:19:56.084
So why didn't you shoot when you had the chance?

01:19:57.584 --> 01:20:00.417
You would've been heroes and finished the mission.

01:20:01.501 --> 01:20:03.542
He told us he'd surrender.

01:20:05.626 --> 01:20:06.251
Manigan.

01:20:07.334 --> 01:20:08.126
Don't.

01:20:10.792 --> 01:20:11.959
And you believed him?

01:20:11.959 --> 01:20:13.292
We were wrong to believe you.

01:20:14.376 --> 01:20:15.001
Shit!

01:20:16.626 --> 01:20:17.626
What did you do?

01:20:18.042 --> 01:20:19.001
What's right.

01:20:20.334 --> 01:20:21.167
You choose.

01:20:21.792 --> 01:20:22.959
Him or us.

01:20:24.251 --> 01:20:25.501
Him, for sure.

01:20:31.376 --> 01:20:32.542
You're not the law.

01:20:43.126 --> 01:20:44.001
Agents.

01:20:44.501 --> 01:20:48.459
Do you enjoy being hunted down?

01:20:49.209 --> 01:20:50.251
Just give it up-

01:20:50.334 --> 01:20:51.792
Boss Chongki!

01:20:53.376 --> 01:20:54.167
Boss!

01:20:56.501 --> 01:20:58.417
What the hell is that, Cocky?

01:20:58.709 --> 01:20:59.667
Nothing, boss.

01:20:59.751 --> 01:21:00.834
Just trash.

01:21:02.251 --> 01:21:03.834
So what's our plan?

01:21:03.959 --> 01:21:06.126
Are we killing these motherfuckers tonight?

01:21:10.709 --> 01:21:12.292
Don't do that in front me.

01:21:12.334 --> 01:21:13.667
I'll smash this on you.

01:21:13.959 --> 01:21:14.876
- Last two.
- Stop that!

01:21:14.917 --> 01:21:15.917
Last two hits.

01:21:19.209 --> 01:21:19.876
Enough!

01:21:25.626 --> 01:21:27.459
Why are the Tondo Kids here?

01:21:27.501 --> 01:21:28.292
You called them?

01:21:28.709 --> 01:21:29.417
No way!

01:21:29.501 --> 01:21:31.084
Motherfucking show offs.

01:21:34.959 --> 01:21:36.501
Got tired of snatching?

01:21:52.417 --> 01:21:53.417
Get back!

01:22:17.459 --> 01:22:19.584
What are those idiots up to?

01:22:44.084 --> 01:22:44.792
Manigan.

01:22:45.501 --> 01:22:46.626
I'll take half.

01:22:48.834 --> 01:22:49.876
You assholes!

01:23:00.167 --> 01:23:00.917
Get him!

01:23:00.917 --> 01:23:02.959
Bring it out!

01:23:04.334 --> 01:23:06.209
Place it here.

01:23:06.417 --> 01:23:07.167
Hurry!

01:23:07.917 --> 01:23:08.917
You're full of shit!

01:23:12.834 --> 01:23:13.626
The fuck is that?

01:23:13.876 --> 01:23:16.501
We'll blast them at once. Saves us bullets!

01:23:16.792 --> 01:23:18.626
Make sure that gets it done.

01:23:18.709 --> 01:23:20.751
It's all on you.

01:23:20.792 --> 01:23:21.667
Yes, boss!

01:23:21.709 --> 01:23:22.876
I got this!

01:23:23.501 --> 01:23:25.542
Light it up quick.

01:23:27.917 --> 01:23:28.917
Will that work?

01:23:29.209 --> 01:23:29.834
Yes, boss.

01:23:29.834 --> 01:23:30.501
You tested it?

01:23:31.292 --> 01:23:32.042
Light them all!

01:23:43.834 --> 01:23:44.876
Boss Biggie!

01:23:45.167 --> 01:23:46.167
Boss Chongki!

01:23:46.792 --> 01:23:48.751
I'll finish this for you!

01:23:53.126 --> 01:23:55.001
Dela Cruz, we already have Kiko.

01:23:55.167 --> 01:23:55.792
How do we proceed?

01:23:55.959 --> 01:23:56.959
Pullout! Pullout!

01:23:57.417 --> 01:23:59.501
But we have the target!

01:24:00.042 --> 01:24:01.334
I said pullout!

01:24:05.834 --> 01:24:07.126
Bautista!

01:24:08.042 --> 01:24:09.792
Guzman, cover me!

01:24:10.251 --> 01:24:12.084
We have to get out!

01:24:12.251 --> 01:24:13.042
Run!

01:24:14.292 --> 01:24:15.084
Sir!

01:24:15.501 --> 01:24:16.292
Manigan!

01:24:22.834 --> 01:24:23.834
Get down!

01:24:25.209 --> 01:24:26.209
One!

01:24:27.167 --> 01:24:28.584
TWo!

01:24:29.209 --> 01:24:30.001
Cocky!

01:24:30.792 --> 01:24:32.334
I'm the one you want right?

01:24:33.209 --> 01:24:33.792
No way!

01:24:34.376 --> 01:24:36.251
Three!

01:24:36.459 --> 01:24:37.417
Fuck you!

01:24:45.126 --> 01:24:46.626
Go down!

01:24:48.417 --> 01:24:50.251
Fuck! Come back!

01:25:10.167 --> 01:25:11.167
Get her!

01:25:31.667 --> 01:25:33.126
Go get her. Damn it!

01:25:54.001 --> 01:25:55.834
Have mercy! Please, no!

01:26:09.251 --> 01:26:11.126
Fuck! That was my lucky tag!

01:26:11.209 --> 01:26:13.126
No, please!

01:26:13.667 --> 01:26:15.626
Don't kill me! I surrender!

01:26:15.626 --> 01:26:16.542
I won't fight!-

01:26:16.542 --> 01:26:17.251
Fuck you!

01:27:45.709 --> 01:27:47.501
You can't kill me!

01:31:39.376 --> 01:31:41.501
That's a bottlecap, not a band-aid.

01:31:42.042 --> 01:31:43.959
That won't help you.

01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:50.292
I believe in this.

01:31:52.501 --> 01:31:54.126
We're still alive, aren't we?

01:31:57.667 --> 01:31:58.709
Aren't we lucky?

01:31:59.876 --> 01:32:01.709
The rest of the squad is dead.

01:32:05.209 --> 01:32:06.376
Don't say that.

01:32:08.334 --> 01:32:11.209
We'll come out alive. You'll see.

01:32:15.042 --> 01:32:15.959
I hope so.

01:32:20.959 --> 01:32:22.876
You still don't believe me?

01:32:28.001 --> 01:32:29.459
I don't know anymore.

01:32:37.584 --> 01:32:38.376
Listen.

01:32:42.876 --> 01:32:44.042
You're not jinxed.

01:32:52.417 --> 01:32:53.459
I am.

01:32:57.334 --> 01:32:58.584
You disappoint me.

01:32:59.334 --> 01:33:01.334
If you listened and left us alone,

01:33:01.334 --> 01:33:03.042
it wouldn't have come to this.

01:33:03.626 --> 01:33:05.209
Your friends would still be alive-

01:33:05.501 --> 01:33:07.084
They're over here!

01:33:09.709 --> 01:33:11.084
Get out!

01:33:11.584 --> 01:33:13.001
Leave us alone!

01:33:16.459 --> 01:33:19.292
You're never gonna escape now.

01:33:19.709 --> 01:33:21.126
Shut up, Chongki!

01:33:22.959 --> 01:33:25.584
You see what we have to go through everyday?

01:33:25.876 --> 01:33:27.501
You think you know suffering?

01:33:27.917 --> 01:33:28.917
Well we do!

01:33:29.584 --> 01:33:31.001
We live a cursed life

01:33:31.751 --> 01:33:32.542
because of you!

01:33:33.501 --> 01:33:34.501
We're sick of this!

01:33:34.834 --> 01:33:36.876
This is your last chance

01:33:37.792 --> 01:33:39.792
to leave now and never return!

01:33:39.792 --> 01:33:42.126
It's not your call, Solomon!

01:33:42.376 --> 01:33:43.709
It's mine now!

01:33:43.876 --> 01:33:44.876
They're mine!

01:33:44.959 --> 01:33:46.292
This has nothing to do with us!

01:33:46.417 --> 01:33:47.751
Go kill each other outside!

01:33:48.126 --> 01:33:50.084
Stop dragging us into your politics!

01:33:50.959 --> 01:33:52.667
You're a fool, Solomon!

01:33:52.917 --> 01:33:54.709
We're just slaves to your business!

01:33:55.334 --> 01:33:56.501
You little shit!

01:33:56.834 --> 01:34:00.167
After all I've done for this place?

01:34:00.376 --> 01:34:02.834
This is how you thank me? Fuck you!

01:34:02.959 --> 01:34:03.959
Fuck you too!

01:34:04.376 --> 01:34:06.042
You murdered my daughter!

01:34:06.209 --> 01:34:07.709
Leave Gracia now!

01:34:08.292 --> 01:34:10.542
If more bloodshed is what it takes, then so be it!

01:34:10.751 --> 01:34:12.001
But this is the last!

01:34:12.001 --> 01:34:13.917
Is that a challenge, motherfucker?

01:34:14.917 --> 01:34:15.792
Kill them all!

01:34:15.959 --> 01:34:16.834
Motherfuckers!

01:34:26.167 --> 01:34:27.834
Stay out of it! Come on!

01:34:47.126 --> 01:34:48.417
Over here!

01:34:50.667 --> 01:34:51.417
Move!

01:34:58.334 --> 01:34:59.792
Go back!

01:35:02.792 --> 01:35:05.292
Go ahead. I'll handle this.

01:35:06.001 --> 01:35:06.626
Go!

01:35:07.126 --> 01:35:08.251
I said g0!

01:35:20.126 --> 01:35:21.626
Follow them!

01:43:50.501 --> 01:43:51.959
Open the caskets.

01:44:08.876 --> 01:44:09.501
Come out!

01:44:15.709 --> 01:44:17.251
You gave us a hard time.

01:44:17.626 --> 01:44:20.084
Thought you could outsmart me, eh?

01:44:20.917 --> 01:44:22.501
All your friends are dead!

01:44:23.042 --> 01:44:24.834
No one's coming to save you.

01:44:25.792 --> 01:44:27.209
Chongki, in our line of work

01:44:28.709 --> 01:44:30.917
people like us don't have saviors.

01:44:31.209 --> 01:44:32.417
Really? Okay.

01:44:37.542 --> 01:44:39.501
You've shut off the jammer?

01:44:39.501 --> 01:44:40.376
Yes, boss.

01:44:43.667 --> 01:44:45.042
Boss Biggie,

01:44:45.042 --> 01:44:46.251
it's done.

01:44:46.542 --> 01:44:49.417
Judas gave the go signal
to get you out of here.

01:44:50.042 --> 01:44:50.917
Yes, boss.

01:45:48.501 --> 01:45:50.084
Hey! Boss Chongki is here!

01:45:51.376 --> 01:45:53.417
- Boss Chongki! Kiss me!
- Set us free!

01:45:53.417 --> 01:45:57.334
- Our debts are paid!
- I like your leopard pants!

01:45:57.334 --> 01:45:59.501
- We've been here for weeks!
- We love you!

01:45:59.501 --> 01:46:00.751
Shut up!

01:46:09.917 --> 01:46:11.001
Boss Chongki!

01:46:49.959 --> 01:46:50.876
Shoot her!

01:46:54.376 --> 01:46:54.959
Don't shoot!

01:47:09.667 --> 01:47:10.876
Just relax.

01:47:18.084 --> 01:47:19.834
I killed Judas.

01:47:21.376 --> 01:47:22.251
Which Judas?

01:47:22.542 --> 01:47:23.584
Dela Cruz.

01:47:24.084 --> 01:47:28.417
He's Judas too, but not the real one.

01:47:29.126 --> 01:47:31.376
Tell me everything you know.

01:47:31.917 --> 01:47:33.167
You gonna kill me?

01:47:33.834 --> 01:47:36.001
My head is worth eighty grand.

01:47:37.001 --> 01:47:38.834
Or you've already reached quota tonight?

01:47:38.876 --> 01:47:40.209
I'm not part of that.

01:47:42.584 --> 01:47:43.709
You deserve a medal!

01:47:43.751 --> 01:47:44.626
Fuck you.

01:47:45.001 --> 01:47:46.084
Who is Judas?

01:47:50.417 --> 01:47:51.251
There's lots of them.

01:47:51.584 --> 01:47:53.334
But I only deal with one.

01:47:54.459 --> 01:47:56.167
And you won't find him here.

01:47:57.126 --> 01:47:58.667
You slaughtered us.

01:47:59.042 --> 01:48:00.917
You slaughtered us too!

01:48:13.459 --> 01:48:14.167
Forgive me.

01:48:22.501 --> 01:48:24.251
You know, this is just business.

01:48:24.501 --> 01:48:26.334
We're businessmen just like you.

01:48:26.626 --> 01:48:28.542
Actually, it's like we work for you.

01:48:28.917 --> 01:48:30.042
It's very simple.

01:48:30.167 --> 01:48:30.667
Listen.

01:48:30.876 --> 01:48:31.792
We sell drugs.

01:48:31.917 --> 01:48:32.584
You say 'illegal'.

01:48:33.084 --> 01:48:36.251
And since we're your 'enemies', you will arrest us.

01:48:36.376 --> 01:48:37.376
Great!

01:48:37.959 --> 01:48:40.584
But actions speak louder than words!

01:48:40.917 --> 01:48:43.834
Don't forget, you profit from our business!

01:48:44.167 --> 01:48:47.126
How can we deal drugs without your blessing?

01:48:47.501 --> 01:48:50.251
You know very well where to find us!

01:48:50.667 --> 01:48:52.501
But you don't want us jailed

01:48:52.501 --> 01:48:54.626
because you will lose income!

01:49:01.042 --> 01:49:01.876
See this?

01:49:05.084 --> 01:49:07.751
This barely covers the trouble you caused me.

01:49:09.167 --> 01:49:11.751
Every bust is a staged kidnapping.

01:49:13.376 --> 01:49:14.792
And for every bust,

01:49:14.792 --> 01:49:17.001
I pay a two hundred grand ransom.

01:49:18.126 --> 01:49:20.417
Because your intel fund isn't enough,

01:49:20.417 --> 01:49:23.251
but I don't care!

01:49:23.251 --> 01:49:24.876
I've been extorted numerous times!

01:49:25.001 --> 01:49:26.126
In fact, I'm ready for this bust.

01:49:26.167 --> 01:49:27.626
I've prepared my ransom.

01:49:27.959 --> 01:49:29.376
Not everyone is corrupt.

01:49:30.251 --> 01:49:33.542
I lost comrades who were just doing their jobs.

01:49:42.626 --> 01:49:43.459
You know,

01:49:43.501 --> 01:49:44.584
all of us,

01:49:44.834 --> 01:49:46.709
are only puppets of those in power.

01:49:47.959 --> 01:49:49.959
If we don't follow, there will be a bust.

01:49:50.417 --> 01:49:54.667
Anti-drugs clean-up operations my ass!

01:49:54.667 --> 01:49:57.417
And you dimwits simply take orders.

01:49:57.792 --> 01:50:01.417
You even give fucking incentives!

01:50:02.917 --> 01:50:04.251
That's so fucked up!

01:50:07.376 --> 01:50:08.834
Twenty grand

01:50:08.876 --> 01:50:10.167
for a dead pusher,

01:50:10.167 --> 01:50:12.376
fifty grand for a middle man,

01:50:12.376 --> 01:50:15.084
and eighty grand for a boss!

01:50:15.376 --> 01:50:17.001
That's just Dela Cruz.

01:50:17.167 --> 01:50:18.334
That bald piece of shit?

01:50:19.001 --> 01:50:22.501
I'm telling you, that fucking bastard is crazy.

01:50:24.084 --> 01:50:25.209
He plays dirty.

01:50:28.917 --> 01:50:32.376
He deals with my competitors to fuck me over.

01:50:34.251 --> 01:50:35.292
Meanwhile Alvarez,

01:50:35.792 --> 01:50:38.292
fucks with all of us.

01:50:40.751 --> 01:50:41.917
That Rudy?

01:50:43.584 --> 01:50:45.084
He's only loyal to some.

01:50:46.459 --> 01:50:50.334
So when Alvarez asked for extra pay, I told him

01:50:50.334 --> 01:50:54.001
"Fuck you! Hand over Dela Cruz!"

01:50:54.876 --> 01:50:57.417
Only a moron would show up at Sulayman.

01:50:58.626 --> 01:50:59.334
Right?

01:51:03.626 --> 01:51:05.251
The reason why you're here,

01:51:08.667 --> 01:51:11.667
is because you were double-crossed

01:51:11.667 --> 01:51:12.792
by Alvarez.

01:51:25.292 --> 01:51:26.751
Shocked he's Judas?

01:51:29.792 --> 01:51:31.501
He's the only one we're dealing with.

01:51:31.751 --> 01:51:33.376
But I know he's just a puppet too.

01:51:35.251 --> 01:51:37.126
I don't buy your lies.

01:51:38.209 --> 01:51:40.042
You can say whatever you want.

01:51:41.876 --> 01:51:43.292
Are you really that dumb?

01:53:33.167 --> 01:53:34.417
Sir Alvarez.

01:53:34.542 --> 01:53:35.042
Biggie,

01:53:35.209 --> 01:53:36.126
have you left Gracia?

01:53:36.584 --> 01:53:39.376
This is a big fucking mess.

01:53:39.959 --> 01:53:41.876
It'll be tough to cover this up.

01:53:42.001 --> 01:53:43.834
Hey, my payment will be worth it.

01:53:44.501 --> 01:53:45.709
Not even enough.

01:53:46.834 --> 01:53:50.167
By the way, return the exchange money.
That's evidence.

01:53:51.001 --> 01:53:52.501
We're on standby.

01:53:53.417 --> 01:53:55.084
Text me when you've left.

01:53:56.334 --> 01:53:57.417
All right, boss.

01:53:57.417 --> 01:53:58.376
As you wish.

01:54:05.959 --> 01:54:09.126
He's even taking the exchange money! Greedy shit.

01:54:10.334 --> 01:54:11.209
See?

01:54:11.917 --> 01:54:12.959
Confirmed!

01:54:23.876 --> 01:54:26.376
Can't tell where the pain's coming from, eh?

01:55:01.459 --> 01:55:02.126
Go ahead.

01:55:04.959 --> 01:55:05.626
Do it.

01:55:18.876 --> 01:55:20.876
You really think you can change the system?

01:55:22.167 --> 01:55:24.251
You'll tell everyone what you told me.

01:55:24.667 --> 01:55:27.084
I'd rather pay than fight them.

01:55:41.376 --> 01:55:42.709
Let's end this.

01:55:47.917 --> 01:55:49.167
He's all we want.

01:55:49.501 --> 01:55:50.917
Give him to us.

01:55:51.709 --> 01:55:53.834
This will not end with Biggie.

01:55:56.376 --> 01:55:58.292
This will just happen again.

01:55:58.917 --> 01:56:03.126
Someone new will take over
and there will be raids just like before.

01:56:04.001 --> 01:56:05.376
This is bigger than us.

01:56:06.751 --> 01:56:08.126
Can we stop it?

01:56:08.834 --> 01:56:09.834
We can,

01:56:11.334 --> 01:56:12.334
or maybe we can't.

01:56:12.792 --> 01:56:15.834
But we'll never know if we don't try.

01:56:17.001 --> 01:56:20.417
Everyone has to know what happened here last night.

01:56:25.042 --> 01:56:25.834
Set them free.

01:56:56.667 --> 01:56:57.959
Clear the whole place!

01:56:58.834 --> 01:56:59.501
GO! Go!

01:57:00.042 --> 01:57:01.042
Move!

01:57:12.042 --> 01:57:14.251
I'm sorry about your squad.

01:57:17.792 --> 01:57:19.792
We don't know the extent of the casualties.

01:57:21.042 --> 01:57:22.584
Thank God you survived.

01:57:23.584 --> 01:57:25.376
And we finally got Biggie Chen.

01:57:28.292 --> 01:57:31.209
This is why the drug war needs to go on.

01:57:35.876 --> 01:57:37.417
Congratulations, Manigan.

01:57:38.584 --> 01:57:39.751
You're a hero!

01:57:44.501 --> 01:57:46.376
Those animals!

01:57:47.501 --> 01:57:49.709
Bring them to the hospital.
Manigan is our priority.

01:57:49.876 --> 01:57:52.084
Is the ambulance here?

01:57:52.126 --> 01:57:52.584
Not yet, sir.

01:57:52.584 --> 01:57:53.167
- Not yet, sir.
- What?

01:57:53.334 --> 01:57:54.959
Okay, we'll use the utility van.

01:58:03.834 --> 01:58:05.501
Hurry!

01:58:16.126 --> 01:58:17.167
Yes, sir.

01:58:28.334 --> 01:58:29.376
Got it, sir.

01:58:30.334 --> 01:58:30.917
Yup.

01:58:40.417 --> 01:58:41.501
No, sir.

01:58:46.959 --> 01:58:48.292
No, sir.

01:58:48.584 --> 01:58:49.917
You won't be implicated.

01:59:04.959 --> 01:59:06.751
Are you with us or not-

01:59:10.459 --> 01:59:11.417
Manigan-

01:59:38.584 --> 01:59:39.667
What happened?

01:59:44.459 --> 01:59:46.167
The suspect fought back.

01:59:54.417 --> 01:59:58.584
The success of the government's
'War on Drugs' prevails.

01:59:58.667 --> 02:00:04.209
Just last night, the elusive Biggie Chen
was finally captured in Gracia ni Maria.

02:00:04.626 --> 02:00:09.042
The police have reported
a total of thirteen casualties,

02:00:09.084 --> 02:00:13.626
which includes pushers,
drug enforcement agents, and local residents.

02:00:13.667 --> 02:00:21.042
The Palace extends our President's salute
to the police for their sacrifice and dedication.

02:00:27.126 --> 02:00:32.667
Listen to the whispers

02:00:34.376 --> 02:00:40.126
of our times in the wind.

02:00:41.709 --> 02:00:48.084
Listen to the screams

02:00:49.042 --> 02:00:55.626
for your time has come to an end.

02:00:56.501 --> 02:01:02.334
Time to decide

02:01:03.751 --> 02:01:09.667
where you will go.

02:01:11.167 --> 02:01:14.001
Time has come,

02:01:15.042 --> 02:01:17.001
time has come

02:01:18.334 --> 02:01:25.084
for you to take a different road.

02:01:26.001 --> 02:01:28.167
Come now

02:01:28.209 --> 02:01:31.501
This drug called meth is dangerous

02:01:31.501 --> 02:01:34.751
Dangerous, dangerous

02:01:34.751 --> 02:01:38.667
Makes the screw in your head go loose

02:01:38.667 --> 02:01:45.667
Brain damage, brain damage
But you're too stubborn to listen

02:01:45.667 --> 02:01:48.792
Pot session continues

02:01:48.792 --> 02:01:52.584
Salvage here, murder there

02:01:52.584 --> 02:01:55.584
Killing here, killing there

02:01:55.584 --> 02:02:02.334
The government declares war

02:02:02.376 --> 02:02:15.959
On marijuana, etcetera.
But New Bilibid is drug HQ

02:02:16.042 --> 02:02:22.917
Protected by high officials too

02:02:22.917 --> 02:02:26.917
This vice puts you to waste

02:02:26.917 --> 02:02:29.834
Bad habit, bad habit

02:02:29.834 --> 02:02:33.834
Your whole body is wasted

02:02:33.876 --> 02:02:37.001
Your future affected

02:02:37.001 --> 02:02:40.334
Addicts go straight to cemetery

02:02:40.417 --> 02:02:44.001
Each and everyone, rests in peace

02:02:44.042 --> 02:02:50.959
Drugs lords become the millionaire

02:02:51.305 --> 02:02:57.178
