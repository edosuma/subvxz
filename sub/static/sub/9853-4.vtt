Hey, Mom,
can I pudding you up?

00:10.511 --> 00:13.384
Harley, what is all this?

00:13.384 --> 00:18.449
Where did you get it,
and when should I
expect the police?

00:18.449 --> 00:19.420
Chillax. It's legit.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.722
Chillax? Legit?

00:21.722 --> 00:24.325
Okay, those words are not
making me feel better.

00:24.325 --> 00:26.657
Then let me switch on
this relaxation machine

00:26.657 --> 00:28.629
as I explain.

00:28.629 --> 00:30.301
( seagulls cawing,
waves crashing )

00:30.301 --> 00:33.504
- ( foghorn blasting )
- That's not relaxing.

00:33.504 --> 00:35.436
That's why I got it
for free.

00:35.436 --> 00:39.009
I've been contacting companies,
giving a little feedback,

00:39.009 --> 00:41.212
and they've been giving me
stuff in exchange.

00:41.212 --> 00:43.574
As a loyal customer,
I need to say,

00:43.574 --> 00:46.577
my latest package of
your chocolate swirl

00:46.577 --> 00:48.879
was way more chocolate
than swirl.

00:48.879 --> 00:50.921
A free case?

00:50.921 --> 00:53.424
That would make me
feel better.

00:54.825 --> 00:57.128
So you got this
from complaining.

00:57.128 --> 00:58.259
Feedback.

00:58.259 --> 01:00.531
Complaining... feedback.

01:00.531 --> 01:02.163
It's a fine line.

01:02.163 --> 01:04.894
But as the middle child
in a family with seven kids,

01:04.894 --> 01:07.838
I've learned the squeaky wheel
gets the grease.

01:07.838 --> 01:11.442
This applies to families
and pudding.

recycle/reuse science project

01:16.547 --> 01:18.409
that's due tomorrow?

01:18.409 --> 01:22.513
Would I be knee-deep in pudding
if I hadn't finished it?

01:22.513 --> 01:23.754
Great.

01:28.359 --> 01:31.962
Uh-oh. I got so caught up
in my free swag,

01:31.962 --> 01:34.495
I totally forgot about
my science project,

01:34.495 --> 01:37.198

30% of my grade.

my invention bag.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.482
Come show me
your science project.

03:01.482 --> 03:03.714
- Now?
- Sure. Why not?

03:03.714 --> 03:06.917
A lot of reasons.
None she's going to like.

03:06.917 --> 03:08.489
Um, okay, Mom.

03:08.489 --> 03:10.521
Be right there.

- No.

Let me rephrase.
I need a star.

03:20.831 --> 03:22.072
Listening.

03:22.072 --> 03:23.674
I entered a film
competition

03:23.674 --> 03:25.506
where you have to make
a short film in 12 hours.

03:25.506 --> 03:27.508
I don't have 12 hours.

03:27.508 --> 03:29.240
Neither do I.

03:29.240 --> 03:31.111
I wasted ten
on my first idea.

03:31.111 --> 03:32.543
It was deep.

03:32.543 --> 03:34.945
Pebbles thrown into
a bucket of water.

03:34.945 --> 03:37.288
Didn't turn out
as good as it sounds.

03:37.288 --> 03:39.920

and I'm not costarring
with a bucket.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.492

costarring with anyone.

It's a zombie movie, and you're
the last woman on Earth.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.599
Would the last woman
on Earth be wearing

03:48.599 --> 03:50.230

she just bought?

The house will
be destroyed.

08:50.460 --> 08:51.832
You told me not to buy
disaster insurance.

08:51.832 --> 08:55.365
We can handle one afternoon
with no Wi-Fi.

08:55.365 --> 08:57.838
We've got books,
board games,

08:57.838 --> 08:59.840
a jigsaw puzzle with
at least three-quarters

08:59.840 --> 09:02.913
of the pieces in it.
We can entertain ourselves.

09:02.913 --> 09:04.615
This family,
all afternoon,

09:04.615 --> 09:06.316
without a screen.

09:06.316 --> 09:08.879

the movies.

when we get back.

Wait a sec.

09:35.906 --> 09:36.847
- Harley!
- ( gasps )

09:39.509 --> 09:41.381
I don't like
where this is going.

09:46.356 --> 09:49.489
Okay, I know it's not
everyone's first choice,

09:49.489 --> 09:51.762
but we have to go to a movie
that's Daphne-appropriate,

09:51.762 --> 09:53.864
so we'll be seeing
 Snoozle Berry Town.

09:53.864 --> 09:57.367
Or as I call it,
an expensive, uncomfortable
upright nap.

09:57.367 --> 09:58.899
Snoozle berries are lame.

09:58.899 --> 10:01.131

a zombie movie.

10:01.131 --> 10:02.873
Ca-caw, ca-caw.

10:02.873 --> 10:04.434
I wanna film
a zombie movie.

10:04.434 --> 10:06.306
Ca-caw, ca-caw.

10:06.306 --> 10:09.079
And again,
we don't see the birds.

10:09.079 --> 10:09.940
Ca-caw!

10:09.940 --> 10:11.882
Harley, you are on
seat-saving duty.

10:11.882 --> 10:13.644
- Can't. Busy.
- Doing what?

10:13.644 --> 10:15.515
Nothing.

10:15.515 --> 10:17.487
Except for, oh,
I don't know,

10:17.487 --> 10:19.650
trying to come up with
a science project

10:19.650 --> 10:21.021
without Mom knowing,

10:21.021 --> 10:22.853
which means that
she can't see this.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.897
Invention bag at home,
cool.

10:26.897 --> 10:29.830
Invention bag at the movies,
sketchy.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.802
She'll know.

10:31.802 --> 10:33.503
Good-bye, Harley After Dark.

10:33.503 --> 10:37.637
I did not wear
enough clothes for seat saving.

10:39.169 --> 10:42.442
A sock on a seat
means taken.

10:42.442 --> 10:44.975
How do you not know that?
Bounce.

10:51.281 --> 10:55.385
Sorry. No outside food.

10:55.385 --> 10:57.187
Gonna have to check
that bag.

10:57.187 --> 10:59.990
Oh, because all
big families

10:59.990 --> 11:03.193
try to cause trouble
and sneak food into the movies?

11:03.193 --> 11:05.435
That's called
profiling, my friend.

11:05.435 --> 11:08.168
Wrestle Smash
 on the road.

11:08.168 --> 11:11.001
Chokehold
at the movies.

11:11.001 --> 11:13.744
- Ca-caw, ca-caw!
- Drop Vin Diesel.

11:13.744 --> 11:15.005
He does not wanna be
a zombie bird.

11:15.005 --> 11:17.647
I have no idea who they are.

11:19.279 --> 11:23.183
You appear to have
something bulky in that jacket.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.285
Nope. Bulk's all me.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.557
Seven kids does
a number on a gal.

11:29.659 --> 11:31.661
( nervous laughter )

11:31.661 --> 11:33.964
Who put packaged snacks
in my vest?

11:33.964 --> 11:35.896
I have no idea
who she is.

11:52.282 --> 11:54.544
Sorry. That seat
is taken.

11:54.544 --> 11:56.186
And that one.

11:56.186 --> 11:57.347
And that one.

11:57.347 --> 11:59.689
Maybe come back
for the 7:15.

12:02.492 --> 12:05.225
I can't think
with all these interruptions.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.197
This is why scientists
work in a lab,

12:07.197 --> 12:08.228
and not a multiplex.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.200
- Harley.
- Whoa!

12:10.200 --> 12:12.162
I'm on high alert here.
I thought you were Mom.

12:12.162 --> 12:14.264
Sorry. Just looking
for an outlet.

12:14.264 --> 12:16.036
Apparently,
the last woman on Earth

12:16.036 --> 12:18.268
can survive an apocalypse
but not frizzy hair.

12:18.268 --> 12:20.040
I may have to go plug
this thing in

12:20.040 --> 12:21.241
at the tire shop
next door.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.613
- That's perfect.
- Not really.

12:23.613 --> 12:25.645
They're probably gonna make me
buy rims first.

12:25.645 --> 12:27.918
No, I mean
my science project.

12:27.918 --> 12:31.451
A motion-powered flatiron
for girls on the go.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.253
Did someone say
girls on the go?

12:33.253 --> 12:35.655
'Cause I'm movin' on up
to the retro-jog.

12:35.655 --> 12:38.358
Eat my dust,
Molly Hooper!

12:40.130 --> 12:41.761
I'm okay.

12:44.634 --> 12:47.037
I'm taking it back
to the retro-walk.

12:54.204 --> 12:56.146
Can we at least
try a rehearsal

12:56.146 --> 12:58.248
while I'm waiting on
your flatiron?

12:58.248 --> 13:00.010
I'm looking like
a stalker out here.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.315
What are you wearing?!

13:05.315 --> 13:07.757
This is zombie apocalypse,
not zombie prom.

13:07.757 --> 13:09.289
I want to look good
for my dance number.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.121
Who's dancing?

13:11.121 --> 13:13.263
Your husband's guts
just got pecked out
by zombie birds.

13:13.263 --> 13:16.967
Yeah, I had a couple
of thoughts about that
dead husband thing.

13:16.967 --> 13:18.698
It's kind of a bummer
for the music I chose.

13:18.698 --> 13:20.230
There's no music!

13:20.230 --> 13:22.102
How am I supposed
to dance without music?

13:22.102 --> 13:24.234
You know what?
I've got ten minute

13:24.234 --> 13:25.976
to shoot and upload
this thing.

13:25.976 --> 13:27.177
Whatever you wanna do.

13:27.177 --> 13:29.639
- ( sighs )
- Action!

13:29.639 --> 13:31.311
Ca-caw, ca-caw!

13:31.311 --> 13:32.682
Cut!

13:32.682 --> 13:35.185
Sorry. Just taking
Daphne to the bathroom.

13:35.185 --> 13:37.888
Great.
Now I have to go.

13:41.922 --> 13:44.124
Don't be so judge-y.

13:44.124 --> 13:46.026
At least mine's
a pizza.

13:55.365 --> 13:59.039
Yes! This thing looks like
it might actually work.

13:59.039 --> 14:00.610
But I've learned,

14:00.610 --> 14:02.772
you never know
until you test it.

14:02.772 --> 14:04.744
Like my rocket-powered
high tops.

14:07.978 --> 14:10.280
This is a motion-powered
hair straightener,

14:10.280 --> 14:14.154
which means I have to be
in motion to test it.

14:15.986 --> 14:17.557
No, no. Shoo!

14:20.330 --> 14:23.033
Enjoy the movie.

14:23.033 --> 14:24.965
This is a problem.

14:24.965 --> 14:27.137
SUZY: Harley.

14:29.799 --> 14:32.943
Correction.
This is a problem.

14:32.943 --> 14:36.176
If Mom catches me,
 it's lights out.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.252
I'm busted.

14:42.252 --> 14:44.314
I'm surrounded
by evidence.

14:44.314 --> 14:46.386
I'm wearing evidence.

14:46.386 --> 14:49.159
Don't move, Harley. Maybe she'll
think you're asleep.

14:51.761 --> 14:53.023
No!

14:54.925 --> 14:57.897
Yes. Take her out, Georgie,
take her out, Georgie,

14:57.897 --> 15:00.770
take her out,
take her out, take her out!

15:00.770 --> 15:03.073
Oh! No!

15:03.073 --> 15:04.804
( yelling )

15:04.804 --> 15:07.307
- Yes!
- Boys!

15:07.307 --> 15:10.680
Sorry, Mom.
You got Wrestle Smashed.

15:10.680 --> 15:12.282
I'll go get
more drinks.

15:12.282 --> 15:13.813
You boys scrape
that popcorn off the floor

15:13.813 --> 15:15.845
and back into the buckets.
Hurry.

15:15.845 --> 15:19.119
Georgie, retro-jog
your butt over here.

15:23.223 --> 15:25.825
This is a motion-powered
hair straightener.

15:25.825 --> 15:27.497
I need you to
test it for me.

15:27.497 --> 15:30.400
Wait. You want me
to walk backwards

15:30.400 --> 15:33.233
while holding
a super hot iron to my head?

15:33.233 --> 15:36.206
I'm in.

15:43.473 --> 15:46.176
No questions, just give me
more money for drinks.

15:46.176 --> 15:47.647
Fine, but we're
a hot dog away from

15:47.647 --> 15:49.349
dipping into
the kids' college fund.

15:55.525 --> 15:57.327
Rachel, you ready?

15:57.327 --> 15:59.389
Getting down to
the wire here.

15:59.389 --> 16:00.590
Ready.

16:00.590 --> 16:02.662
Okay.

16:02.662 --> 16:06.296
Last woman on Earth,
and action.

16:11.071 --> 16:13.373
Hey, everybody,
it's Sassy Sunday,

16:13.373 --> 16:15.145
and I'm talking about
makeup that brings you

16:15.145 --> 16:16.476
from day to night.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.208
Who's everybody?

16:18.208 --> 16:19.679
You're the last woman
on Earth.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.681
Sh. Me time.

16:21.681 --> 16:24.414
I've gotten lots of comments
about transitional brows.

16:24.414 --> 16:26.616
Brows?
Sassy Sunday?

16:26.616 --> 16:29.889
- How is this
a zombie movie?
- It's not. Never was.

16:29.889 --> 16:33.263
- We're doing an entry
for my fashion blog.
- What?!

16:33.263 --> 16:35.565
Like I'd spend an afternoon
on a zombie movie.

16:35.565 --> 16:36.826
Grow up, Ethan.

16:36.826 --> 16:39.529
Sassy Sunday!
Ca-caw!

16:41.431 --> 16:44.634
Fun! Dance party!
Whoo!

16:44.634 --> 16:46.976
We gotta go.
Movie's starting.

16:51.841 --> 16:53.513
Come on, Georgie.
Straight hair, Georgie.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.915
Come on, Georgie,
let's see that project working.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.119
Oh! I blew it!

16:59.119 --> 17:00.450
How could I have been so...

17:02.752 --> 17:05.525
Awesome!
I crushed it. Yes!

17:05.525 --> 17:08.198
Whoa!

17:08.198 --> 17:11.030
No. You crushed it.

17:14.664 --> 17:17.436
Don't worry, Harley.
It looks worse than it is.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.941
Actually, no,
it is really bad.

17:24.444 --> 17:25.744
Hand me that tub.

17:25.744 --> 17:27.446
I may throw up.

17:34.184 --> 17:38.688
Uh, Tom, this doesn't seem
like Snoozle Berry Town.

17:38.688 --> 17:40.630
I'm sure the snoozle berries
will sneak out

17:40.630 --> 17:42.132
right from behind
that tombstone.

17:42.132 --> 17:44.094
( screaming )

17:44.094 --> 17:45.895
Did you buy tickets
for the wrong movie?

17:45.895 --> 17:48.238
It appears I did,
but we've sunk

17:48.238 --> 17:50.240
several hundred dollars
into this and there's
no Wi-Fi at home.

17:50.240 --> 17:53.042
- Good point.
- ( screaming )

17:53.042 --> 17:55.004
- I'll get the car.
- I'll meet you there.

17:55.004 --> 17:57.307
Everyone, cover the eyes
of the person next to you.

18:07.357 --> 18:09.319
So this is how it ends.

18:09.319 --> 18:12.622
Good-bye, living room
after dark.

18:12.622 --> 18:15.425
We've had some fun nights
together.

18:15.425 --> 18:17.267
I feel ya.
My zombie movie

18:17.267 --> 18:20.470
got turned into some kind of
dance party/fashion tutorial.

18:20.470 --> 18:22.432
On the bright side,
Rachel told me

18:22.432 --> 18:24.634
it already got
75 likes.

18:24.634 --> 18:26.606
Mom wants to see
my science project

18:26.606 --> 18:28.208
as soon as she's done
putting frozen peas

18:28.208 --> 18:30.840
on Georgie's ankle,
and I got nothing.

18:34.484 --> 18:37.547
I thought we were being
bummed out together here.

18:37.547 --> 18:39.689
Sorry. During all that
waiting for Rachel,

18:39.689 --> 18:41.451
I got some funny
behind-the-scenes footage

18:41.451 --> 18:42.622
of the family.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.454
They would totally
crack up.

18:51.301 --> 18:53.032
Maybe they can.

18:53.032 --> 18:54.604
Give me ten minutes.

18:54.604 --> 18:56.466
( laughing )

19:00.810 --> 19:02.742
Hey, everybody,
it's Sassy Sunday.

19:02.742 --> 19:05.074
Sassy Sunday!
Ca-caw!

19:05.074 --> 19:08.778
( laughter )

19:24.364 --> 19:26.696
Maybe we should be
a tag team instead.

19:26.696 --> 19:29.399
We're going
straight to the top.

19:29.399 --> 19:31.771
Pass the sour bears.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.675
Oh, great projector,
Harley.

19:35.675 --> 19:38.308
I knew you were gonna have
a killer recycle/reuse project.

19:38.308 --> 19:40.950
The key is getting
an early start.

19:47.587 --> 19:49.289
Anything you'd
like to tell me?

20:10.440 --> 20:12.442
Oh, I need these peas.

20:12.442 --> 20:13.783
I raided the pantry
for my gift basket,

20:13.783 --> 20:15.685
and that's all
that's left for dinner.

20:15.685 --> 20:18.888
Uh-oh, you're dressed
in black and carrying a basket?

20:18.888 --> 20:20.420
Did someone die?

20:20.420 --> 20:22.091
Yes. Our Wi-Fi.

20:22.091 --> 20:25.625
Apparently, the company
is no longer taking phone calls

20:25.625 --> 20:27.657
from Suzy Diaz,
so I'm going down there

20:27.657 --> 20:29.929
with some delicious
treats to woo them back.

20:29.929 --> 20:32.632
Deviled ham?
And it's expired.

20:32.632 --> 20:34.804
So are the canned peaches.
But look at the pretty bow.

20:34.804 --> 20:37.637
Daphne, come on!
Let's go!

20:37.637 --> 20:40.270
No one can say no
to a sweet little girl.

20:40.270 --> 20:43.743
Wrestle Smash 15:
 Zombie Bird Throwdown!

20:43.743 --> 20:45.715
Ca-caw!

20:45.715 --> 20:48.378
What happened to
that nice dress I put you in?

20:48.378 --> 20:51.421
Zombie birds don't
throw down in dresses.

20:51.421 --> 20:54.083
Ca-caw! Ca-caw!
Ca-caw!

20:55.955 --> 20:58.087
Maybe they'll
feel sorry for me.

20:58.087 --> 20:59.629
Let's go.

20:59.629 --> 21:02.662
