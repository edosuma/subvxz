WEBVTT

00:03.771 --> 00:06.374
(LAUGHS) Oh,
Chris Paul's on fire!

00:06.440 --> 00:07.608
Nothing but net!

00:08.809 --> 00:10.578
(SIGHS) Come on, Dave.
You're missing it.

00:10.644 --> 00:12.546
If the drought
continues at this rate,

00:12.613 --> 00:14.882
soon we'll have
to get our water
from Colorado.

00:15.949 --> 00:17.685
Colorado?
Oh, no.

00:17.751 --> 00:19.620
What will those hippies
fill their bongs with?

00:19.687 --> 00:21.589
What?
Nothing.

00:21.655 --> 00:23.557
All right, look at
how these guys are
playing defense.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.193
Always making stops...

00:26.360 --> 00:27.761
Dave, can I see that,
please?

00:28.762 --> 00:30.164
Oh. Whoop.

00:32.266 --> 00:33.467
Now, I want you
to watch this, dawg.

00:33.534 --> 00:34.668
Your team has
a playoff game coming up.

00:34.735 --> 00:35.969
You might
learn something.

00:36.036 --> 00:36.970
(WHISTLE BLOWS)
What? Are you
kidding me?

00:37.037 --> 00:38.772
That's a terrible
call, ref!

00:38.839 --> 00:40.208
Come on,
you're killing me!

00:40.574 --> 00:42.543
Right?

00:42.610 --> 00:43.777
He wasn't traveling.

00:43.844 --> 00:46.647
No, the guy on the bench
took one sip of water

00:46.714 --> 00:47.915
and threw it out.

00:49.517 --> 00:51.152
So wasteful, number 10.

00:51.219 --> 00:55.556
I bet you flush every time,
even when it's just pee!

00:55.623 --> 00:57.425
All right,
solid trash talk.

00:57.491 --> 01:00.394
Liking the tone,
we just have to work
on the message.

01:00.461 --> 01:02.996
How long are your
showers, buddy? An hour?

01:03.063 --> 01:04.765
All right, beast.
Take a knee.

01:14.108 --> 01:16.477
I just can't get the kid
interested in basketball.

01:16.544 --> 01:18.646
I mean, you try to force
them into doing stuff

01:18.712 --> 01:20.381
like they say in all
the parenting books...

01:20.448 --> 01:22.616
Wait, what parenting
books did you read?

01:23.617 --> 01:25.453
I skimmed them, okay?

01:26.887 --> 01:30.191
The point is,
all Dave cares about
is that stupid drought.

01:30.258 --> 01:31.559
So what if it doesn't rain,

01:31.625 --> 01:34.528
as long as you can
rain buckets down
on suckas, am I right?

01:35.796 --> 01:37.965
No, we need actual rain.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.669
I thought Dave would
be more of a baller

01:41.735 --> 01:44.238
considering the physical
advantages you gave him.

01:46.207 --> 01:47.441
Thanks?
Nope.

01:49.177 --> 01:51.245
I'm surprised they let
a tiny bird like you

01:51.312 --> 01:53.314
even watch basketball.

01:54.748 --> 01:56.684
Okay, I was actually
decent when I was little.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.486
I mean, for the first
eight games I sucked

01:58.552 --> 02:00.053
and I really wanted to quit...

02:00.120 --> 02:02.623
Anyway, this one game
against the junior Panthers,

02:02.690 --> 02:05.259
down by one,
two seconds left,
I grab the rock,

02:05.326 --> 02:07.328
I drove through the paint,
I flipped it up,

02:07.395 --> 02:10.030
nothing but nylon
and I got the 'W'.

02:10.097 --> 02:11.565
Okay, I am lost.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.668
He scored. They won.

02:14.735 --> 02:17.671
And then he got
to stay at the 'W'?

02:18.906 --> 02:20.741
No, nobody stayed
at the 'W'.

02:20.808 --> 02:23.311
I made a basket,
and I fell in love
with the game.

02:23.377 --> 02:24.678
And that's all I want
for Dave...

02:24.745 --> 02:26.514
You know, that one
shining moment.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.316
I had my share
of shining moments.

02:28.382 --> 02:30.117
You know, very oily skin.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.188
Fortunately,
no one noticed.

02:34.255 --> 02:36.224
They were distracted
by my back brace.

02:37.124 --> 02:38.392
Man, you had
a rough childhood.

02:38.459 --> 02:40.628
Childhood? No, I'm talking
about my early 30s.

02:42.696 --> 02:45.165
Oh, my God!
Check this out.
Check this out.

02:45.233 --> 02:47.801
My friend Joanne's renting
a house in Cabo this weekend,

02:47.868 --> 02:49.303
and room just opened up.

02:49.370 --> 02:52.640
Wow! I mean, I only met her
that one time at lunch.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.375
But that lunch must have
gone pretty well...

02:54.442 --> 02:57.945
(IN SINGSONG VOICE)
'Cause she's inviting
me to Mexico.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.046
No, no.

02:59.112 --> 03:00.448
She's inviting
me to Mexico.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.516
Oh.

03:02.583 --> 03:04.885
Guess that lunch didn't
go as well as I thought.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.256
Oh, wait, I can't go.

03:08.322 --> 03:10.224
I'm all out
of vacation days.

03:10.291 --> 03:12.793
Oh, that's too bad.

03:12.860 --> 03:16.830
Ooh. Remember a while back
when Pat accidentally said

03:16.897 --> 03:19.900
something racially insensitive
and offered you vacation days

03:19.967 --> 03:21.269
to not report him?

03:21.335 --> 03:23.136
Oh, I do remember that.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.638
You are the best!

03:24.705 --> 03:25.873
Thanks.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.508
Tell that to Joanne.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.144
Hey, Pat.
You got a sec?

03:31.211 --> 03:33.547
I have tons of secs.

03:36.149 --> 03:37.451
Well, that
was unfortunate.

03:37.518 --> 03:38.586
So what can
I help you with?

03:38.652 --> 03:41.455
Oh, um, well,
Dr. Ken is trying

03:41.522 --> 03:43.056
to get his son
into basketball.

03:43.123 --> 03:44.157
Oh, has he tried
forcing him

03:44.224 --> 03:45.693
like they say
in the parenting books?

03:47.127 --> 03:48.562
Yeah, that
didn't work.
Oh.

03:48.629 --> 03:51.365
So, I was wondering
who here on the staff

03:51.432 --> 03:52.800
do you think
would be best

03:52.866 --> 03:55.002
to help him out
with basketball?

03:55.068 --> 03:57.170
You, obviously.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.473
I mean, you have
the genetics.

04:00.541 --> 04:01.709
Yeah, I mean,
didn't you tell me

04:01.775 --> 04:03.311
your dad was
a basketball coach?

04:03.377 --> 04:05.212
You must have
picked something up.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.615
Yeah.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.216
He was
a basketball coach.

04:09.283 --> 04:10.651
(CHUCKLES)

04:10.718 --> 04:12.820
Damn it.

04:12.886 --> 04:15.188
It's a shame your dad
didn't coach race baiting.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.491
You'd be packing
your bags right now.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.333
Whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

04:25.399 --> 04:26.867
To a study group.
I'm sorry.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.869
Did you say 'study group'
or 'slutty group'?

04:30.871 --> 04:32.205
What are you
studying, business?

04:32.272 --> 04:34.174
'Cause everyone
can basically see yours.

04:36.143 --> 04:37.445
Go finish
getting dressed.

04:37.511 --> 04:39.947
Oh, so I'm not allowed
to go out in this?

04:40.013 --> 04:43.384
Fine, step all over
my first amendment rights.

04:43.451 --> 04:44.618
First amendment?
Which one's that?

04:44.685 --> 04:46.019
Right to bare everything?

04:46.086 --> 04:49.523
Ooh,
constitutionally burnt.

04:50.324 --> 04:51.392
(GROANS)

04:52.526 --> 04:54.227
Where's the rest
of your outfit?

04:54.294 --> 04:55.396
It's hiding,

04:55.463 --> 04:57.130
along with your
athletic talent.

04:57.197 --> 04:58.432
The joke's on you.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.300
I know I'm not
good at sports.

05:03.371 --> 05:06.273
Mom, can I skip my basketball
game tomorrow night?

05:06.340 --> 05:08.241
What? Of course not, buddy.
It's the playoffs.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.577
Are you mom?

05:12.279 --> 05:13.681
Why don't you
want to go, Dave?

05:13.747 --> 05:15.516
Because they're having
a city council hearing

05:15.583 --> 05:16.750
about the drought.

05:17.851 --> 05:20.320
And basketball's stupid.

05:20.388 --> 05:22.723
Okay, if you really don't
want to go to the game...

05:24.992 --> 05:26.660
You know what?
Your dad and I
will discuss it.

05:26.727 --> 05:27.861
Why don't you go
chill in the den?

05:27.928 --> 05:29.897
You know,
the lion's den?

05:29.963 --> 05:32.199
Because that's what
your team's called?

05:32.265 --> 05:33.467
That's news to me.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.671
Seriously?
You're gonna let him
quit basketball?

05:37.738 --> 05:39.139
Look, I know we
want them to finish

05:39.206 --> 05:40.441
what they start...
That's right.

05:40.508 --> 05:42.342
Yet he quit soccer
after two games,

05:42.410 --> 05:43.944
tennis after one week,

05:44.011 --> 05:45.913
and you let him
quit swimming
after 10 minutes.

05:45.979 --> 05:47.415
I didn't let him quit.

05:47.481 --> 05:49.517
I pulled him out of the
pool unconscious.

05:52.285 --> 05:54.555
You can't force kids
to stick with things

05:54.622 --> 05:55.756
they don't want to do.

05:55.823 --> 05:57.958
It'll make them reluctant
to try new things.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.893
Look, sometimes
someone encourages you

05:59.960 --> 06:01.161
to do something
you don't want to do

06:01.228 --> 06:02.295
and you end up liking it.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.864
Don't bring up
our wedding night.

06:05.332 --> 06:06.767
I'm just saying,
I was hesitant,

06:06.834 --> 06:09.102
and you encouraged me,
and now I love that.

06:12.305 --> 06:14.274
Let's face it,
you've made him
play basketball

06:14.341 --> 06:15.609
for the last two seasons

06:15.676 --> 06:17.310
and he hasn't gotten
a lot out of it.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.379
And it's the last game.

06:19.447 --> 06:21.248
But what if this
is the game where he has
his one shining moment?

06:21.314 --> 06:22.783
Look, if my parents
had let me quit,

06:22.850 --> 06:24.317
I never would have
had mine.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.019
Did I ever tell you
about the time I...

06:26.086 --> 06:27.287
Drove to the paint,
threw it up,

06:27.354 --> 06:29.457
and stayed at the "w."

06:29.523 --> 06:33.427
Why does everyone think
I stayed at the 'W'?

06:33.494 --> 06:35.996
I know you would
love for him to be
into basketball,

06:36.063 --> 06:37.498
but he's just not
a sporty kid.

06:37.565 --> 06:39.332
No, he thinks
he's not a sporty kid,

06:39.399 --> 06:40.668
and that kills me,

06:40.734 --> 06:42.269
because I don't him
to label himself

06:42.335 --> 06:43.671
at such a young age.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.373
And all it takes
is one play to go his way.

06:46.440 --> 06:48.108
And who knows?
Maybe in a year

06:48.175 --> 06:50.377
he'll grow a few inches
and score some buckets

06:50.444 --> 06:52.112
and he'll start
to believe in himself.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.583
Okay.
I'll make you a deal.

06:55.649 --> 06:56.750
He plays tomorrow.

06:56.817 --> 06:58.285
Deal. Very reasonable.
Thank you, Allison.

06:58.351 --> 06:59.953
No, no.
But, but, but...

07:00.020 --> 07:02.189
If he doesn't have
his 'shining moment'

07:02.255 --> 07:04.725
and he dislikes it
as much as he has
all season,

07:04.792 --> 07:06.560
we never make him play
ever again.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.897
Okay. Fair enough.

07:09.963 --> 07:13.634
Hey, there's my little
Korean Abdul-Jabbar.

07:14.602 --> 07:16.937
Does this mean
I have to play?

07:17.004 --> 07:19.139
Yes, it does, buddy,
but it'll be great.

07:19.206 --> 07:21.008
Trust me.
Oh, look.

07:21.074 --> 07:24.612
Chris Paul dishes to Park,
who's open in the corner!

07:24.678 --> 07:25.679
You caught it.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.648
Yeah, 'cause it's food.

07:36.657 --> 07:38.726
Okay, I don't know
what your coach has
been teaching you,

07:38.792 --> 07:40.628
but this is a lay-up.

07:40.694 --> 07:43.196
You dribble, take two steps,
and lay it up.

07:43.263 --> 07:44.297
Watch and learn.

07:49.002 --> 07:51.204
Dad, I'm just not
a jock like you.

07:51.271 --> 07:52.806
Aw, thanks, buddy.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.074
But you can be a jock.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.243
It's not just about
natural talent.

07:56.309 --> 07:59.279
It's about desire,
effort, focus...

07:59.346 --> 08:01.448
The Kellners'
sprinklers are on

08:01.515 --> 08:03.584
and it's not even
a watering day.

08:03.651 --> 08:05.819
(SIGHS)

08:05.886 --> 08:07.420
Hey, the only drought
you should be worried about

08:07.487 --> 08:09.389
is your scoring
drought. Mmm?

08:09.456 --> 08:11.124
Ah, wordplay...

08:11.191 --> 08:13.160
The crutch
of the unclever.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.434
Kobe!

08:31.344 --> 08:33.547
Any luck with
the Pat thing?
Not yet.

08:33.614 --> 08:35.816
I got some new stuff
locked and loaded.

08:35.883 --> 08:38.218
Oh, Pat is gonna
get me to Mexico.

08:38.285 --> 08:39.687
Should be doable.

08:39.753 --> 08:42.389
The little person
in accounting
ended up with a car.

08:43.390 --> 08:44.391
Hey, Pat.

08:44.457 --> 08:45.458
Mmm-hmm?

08:45.525 --> 08:46.927
Guess what.

08:46.994 --> 08:48.829
A new Tyler Perry
movie just opened.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.330
Oh, you've got
to go see it.

08:50.397 --> 08:51.599
You would love it.

08:52.432 --> 08:53.734
Oh, really?

08:53.801 --> 08:55.468
And why exactly
would I love it, Pat?

08:55.535 --> 08:57.404
(LAUGHS) Because
everybody would love it.

08:58.171 --> 08:59.707
It's hysterical.

08:59.773 --> 09:01.074
I saw it last weekend.

09:01.141 --> 09:02.876
He plays... He plays,
like, three women,

09:02.943 --> 09:04.411
all different sizes.

09:04.477 --> 09:06.680
I mean... (LAUGHS)

09:06.747 --> 09:08.616
The man...
The man is a genius.

09:11.284 --> 09:13.420
Oh... (LAUGHS)

09:16.590 --> 09:18.358
Damn it.

09:18.425 --> 09:20.861
Movie was kind of
funny, though.

09:20.928 --> 09:22.395
When the two grandmothers
start farting...

09:22.462 --> 09:24.765
Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup!
Spoiler alert.

09:24.832 --> 09:25.866
Sorry.

09:32.505 --> 09:35.475
(LAUGHS) Carbo-loading
for the big game.

09:35.542 --> 09:36.610
(CHUCKLES)

09:36.677 --> 09:38.378
No, I'm just
eating my feelings

09:38.445 --> 09:41.649
about missing
the city council meeting.

09:41.715 --> 09:43.784
Well, why don't you put
the rest of your feelings

09:43.851 --> 09:45.452
in a tupperware
and eat them later?

09:45.518 --> 09:46.519
We've got to get going.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.891
Again?
Are you kidding me?

09:50.958 --> 09:53.694
What? I thought I'd
wear a nice outfit to
go support my brother?

09:53.761 --> 09:55.495
Do you have another
brother who's a pimp?

09:59.399 --> 10:00.768
You guys
just don't get it.

10:00.834 --> 10:03.570
Fashion is all about
taking risks.

10:03.637 --> 10:06.339
Like the risk of getting
your private parts sun burnt?

10:09.042 --> 10:11.078
Come on, mom.
I'm sure you wore
plenty of things

10:11.144 --> 10:13.180
grandma didn't
approve of.

10:13.246 --> 10:15.315
Like, I don't know,
go-go boots and
poodle skirts.

10:15.382 --> 10:17.517
How old do you
think I am?

10:20.087 --> 10:21.454
Look, even
in high school,

10:21.521 --> 10:23.556
I prided myself
on dressing appropriately.

10:23.623 --> 10:27.027
They say
"Dress for the job you want,
not the job you have."

10:27.094 --> 10:29.096
You mean
you always dressed
like a therapist?

10:29.162 --> 10:30.597
But that's the
job you have.

10:30.664 --> 10:33.033
Did you have
a different job
in high school?

10:33.100 --> 10:36.169
Okay, it wasn't
the clearest analogy.

10:36.236 --> 10:37.805
Go find something
appropriate to wear.

10:37.871 --> 10:39.406
But we're gonna
be late for the game.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.341
Okay, Molly,
just meet us there.

10:41.408 --> 10:42.776
Fine.

10:44.611 --> 10:46.313
Maybe I shouldn't go,
either.

10:46.379 --> 10:49.316
This tank top
doesn't leave a lot
to the imagination.

10:54.087 --> 10:55.622
(WHISTLE BLOWS
(CHEERING)

10:59.592 --> 11:01.762
You can do this, Dave!
You got this!

11:01.829 --> 11:03.296
He's on the bench,
tying his shoe.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.899
Yeah, like a boss.

11:05.966 --> 11:08.535
No, rabbit through
the hole, yo!

11:11.004 --> 11:14.207
Whoo-hoo!
Youth sports ball.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.609
Is Dave's team
in white or cerise?

11:18.245 --> 11:19.379
Clark, what are
you doing here?

11:19.446 --> 11:20.580
You said
you had a date.

11:20.647 --> 11:21.815
Oh, you know what?
I did. But then I thought,

11:21.882 --> 11:23.316
"if this is
important to you,

11:23.383 --> 11:25.085
"it is important to me."

11:25.152 --> 11:27.254
Guy stood you up?
Bitch did not even text.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.588
Go Dave!

11:30.157 --> 11:31.691
Hey, guys.
How's it the game?

11:31.759 --> 11:33.626
Well, Dave's
not in yet. But...

11:33.693 --> 11:34.895
(CHEERING)

11:35.929 --> 11:37.464
OMG, love.

11:39.366 --> 11:40.700
Two questions...

11:40.768 --> 11:43.636
"What the hell?"
And "Are you insane?"

11:43.703 --> 11:47.574
Okay, that's it.
I'm looking up
convents in the 818.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.877
I'm surprised you're making
such a big deal about this.

11:49.943 --> 11:54.114
In fact, I thought
this skirt might look
a little familiar, mom.

11:54.181 --> 11:55.983
Oh, it does.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.617
Oh, very clever.

11:57.684 --> 12:00.754
You went to the attic
and got out all my
high school clothes.

12:00.821 --> 12:03.323
Hmm, you got me.
You really got me.

12:03.390 --> 12:04.624
So, I guess
when you said

12:04.691 --> 12:06.359
you would never wear
something like this,

12:06.426 --> 12:08.161
you lied to me?

12:08.228 --> 12:10.363
Yeah, I feel
really stupid.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.632
But probably
not as stupid as you,

12:12.699 --> 12:14.768
because that skirt
you're wearing...

12:15.836 --> 12:17.137
It's a headband.

12:19.206 --> 12:20.507
You want to put
your coat back on?

12:20.573 --> 12:23.944
Sure, but only
because I'm chilly.

12:24.011 --> 12:25.378
(BOOING)

12:25.445 --> 12:27.347
Settle down,
pervs. You wish.

12:29.983 --> 12:32.185
Ah!

12:32.252 --> 12:33.486
Oh, no.
The ref got hurt.

12:33.553 --> 12:34.988
Good, he sucks.

12:35.055 --> 12:36.623
What's the matter
with you?

12:36.689 --> 12:37.757
Am I wrong?

12:37.825 --> 12:39.292
Okay, guys.
Take a knee.

12:39.359 --> 12:41.128
Is anyone here
a doctor?

12:42.362 --> 12:43.730
I'm off the clock.

12:45.532 --> 12:46.867
Fine.

12:50.203 --> 12:51.905
(GROANS)
Oh, yeah.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.606
Bad sprain.
You're done.

12:53.673 --> 12:55.809
Ice it, stay off it
for a few days,

12:55.876 --> 12:57.677
which will give you
time to learn the rules
of basketball

12:57.744 --> 12:59.847
so you can stop
ruining children's lives.

13:00.848 --> 13:02.315
I doubt we can
find another ref.

13:02.382 --> 13:03.483
I guess
it's a forfeit, huh?

13:03.550 --> 13:05.252
I'll be in the car.

13:05.318 --> 13:06.553
Stay. Sit.

13:07.720 --> 13:08.721
I can ref.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.390
Does he know
how to ref?

13:10.457 --> 13:12.192
No, but not knowing
how to do something

13:12.259 --> 13:13.861
has never stopped
him before.

13:14.761 --> 13:16.897
Okay. Let's do this.

13:16.964 --> 13:18.731
Oof!

13:18.798 --> 13:20.633
Someone hit the
cool ranch pretty
hard for lunch.

13:45.725 --> 13:47.094
Foul, number 23.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.829
Oh, don't give me that look.
You mugged him.

13:49.897 --> 13:52.732
Give him back his wallet.
Two shots.

13:52.799 --> 13:54.902
Oh, you think
you're so cute...

13:54.968 --> 13:56.236
Well, you are irresistible.

Offensive foul!

14:05.112 --> 14:06.146
Good call, ref.

14:06.213 --> 14:07.347
Oh, "Good call ref."

14:07.414 --> 14:10.217
One more compliment
and you're out of here!

Respect our coaches, ref.

try Priceline.

It's a travel website.
Trust me, it's fine.

14:32.072 --> 14:34.541
All right, that's the
end of a pretty sloppy

Water break.

14:40.780 --> 14:43.250
Come on, dad.
Be part of the solution.

14:47.754 --> 14:50.357
No, Joanne, I don't know
if I'm gonna make it.

14:50.423 --> 14:51.491
I'm trying.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.060
Oh, got to go.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.196
Hey, Pat.

14:56.263 --> 14:57.730
You want to guess who
my two favorite female
tennis stars are

14:57.797 --> 14:59.699
or my preferred way
of cooking chicken?

15:02.302 --> 15:03.536
Damona...
Hmm?

15:03.603 --> 15:04.671
I know what
you're up to.

15:04.737 --> 15:05.805
You do?

15:05.872 --> 15:07.740
Oh, yes.

15:07.807 --> 15:11.278
Coming up,
engaging me in all these
random conversations,

15:11.344 --> 15:13.780
it's pretty obvious,
really.

15:13.846 --> 15:15.182
You're flirting with me.

15:18.651 --> 15:21.254
Oh, no, no.
No, no, no...

15:21.321 --> 15:23.390
(SHUSHING)
Damona, please.

15:23.456 --> 15:25.292
It's only natural.

15:25.358 --> 15:27.060
I know that you know
that I've recently
become available

15:27.127 --> 15:30.263
and I'm up to
10 minutes a day on
the old NordicTrack.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.767
I can only imagine
that my power,

15:34.834 --> 15:37.971
both professional
and raw...

15:38.038 --> 15:39.172
Ha.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.175
...Is quite alluring.

15:43.376 --> 15:44.644
Pat, I was...

15:44.711 --> 15:46.446
Damona, don't
be embarrassed.

15:46.513 --> 15:47.714
Trust me.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.682
If circumstances
were different,

15:49.749 --> 15:51.184
I'd be all over that.

15:51.251 --> 15:52.385
Mmm.

15:54.087 --> 15:57.957
But we work together,
so it must never be.

15:59.426 --> 16:00.994
I think I'm
gonna be sick.

16:02.595 --> 16:04.564
I understand.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.866
I've hurt you.

take a day off work,
you know?

that I could take
a day off?

what I told you.

16:54.181 --> 16:55.982
About pointing out
a pretty girl's flaws

16:56.049 --> 16:57.584
to knock her down
to your level?

16:57.650 --> 16:59.719
No! I mean, yes,
it works every time...

16:59.786 --> 17:01.521
But I'm talking
about basketball.

take it.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.540
Oh, you talking
back to the ref?

Are you sassing me?

No, I just...
I didn't know...

17:55.842 --> 17:57.076
Oh, really?

17:57.144 --> 17:58.245
You want
some of this?

17:58.311 --> 17:59.412
Okay, fine.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.614
(BLOWS WHISTLE)
You're out of the game!

keep walking, pal.

18:09.822 --> 18:11.724
You get out of here.
You get out of here!

18:17.464 --> 18:19.832
Seriously?
Even with a coat?

18:22.402 --> 18:23.603
Can we finish
the game?

18:23.670 --> 18:24.737
You know what?

18:24.804 --> 18:26.506
I'm gonna go
watch my son

18:26.573 --> 18:28.875
do something
he actually wants to do.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.177
Clark, you're the ref.

18:30.243 --> 18:32.145
No worries, Dr. Ken.
I got this.

18:32.212 --> 18:33.546
I seen it on "espin."

18:39.586 --> 18:42.355
So, I am not
super-firm on the rules,

18:42.422 --> 18:44.957
so just... Honor system.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.059
And serving!

18:53.733 --> 18:56.836
Dave, you were
en fuego at that hearing.

18:56.903 --> 18:58.471
(CHUCKLES)

18:58.538 --> 18:59.772
When you told the council
that their conservation plan

18:59.839 --> 19:01.341
was myopic and naive,

19:01.408 --> 19:03.743
I was like,
"H-2-O-no, he didn't!"

19:04.677 --> 19:06.145
I know, I heard you.

19:06.213 --> 19:07.880
Thanks, dad.

19:10.217 --> 19:12.051
Ooh, left the meeting
agenda in the car.

19:12.118 --> 19:14.487
I want to put it up
where my trophies
would go.

19:17.557 --> 19:20.860
Mom, thanks for, you know,
lending me your headband.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.864
Sorry about
the misunderstanding.

19:24.931 --> 19:26.165
That's okay.

19:26.233 --> 19:28.935
You know, you did have
a lot of cute clothes
up there.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.169
You think so?

19:30.237 --> 19:32.305
Yeah, you must have
been like the hottest girl

19:32.372 --> 19:33.540
at all those sock hops.

19:36.709 --> 19:38.311
I'm not 70!

19:41.080 --> 19:42.749
I'm really proud of you.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.751
That was super sweet,
what you did back there.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.419
I call them
like I see them.

19:46.486 --> 19:48.621
And even though it wasn't
on the basketball court,

19:48.688 --> 19:50.490
Dave got his
shining moment after all.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.792
When he accused
Councilman Sanders

19:52.859 --> 19:54.694
of being in the pocket
of Big Sod,

19:54.761 --> 19:56.696
you could hear
a pin drop.

19:56.763 --> 19:58.398
Well, there were only
six people there,

19:58.465 --> 20:01.601
so for most of it,
you could hear a pin drop.

20:01.668 --> 20:02.735
I know it would have
been great for you

20:02.802 --> 20:03.936
if Dave was
into basketball,

20:04.003 --> 20:05.838
but whatever his
passion ends up being,

20:05.905 --> 20:07.106
you'll share it
with him.

20:07.173 --> 20:09.141
Al, I know
I say it so often

20:09.208 --> 20:10.443
and it might have
lost its meaning,

20:10.510 --> 20:13.513
but you were right
and I was wrong.

20:13.580 --> 20:16.249
No, that will always
mean something to me.

20:16.316 --> 20:17.584
(LAUGHS)

20:23.390 --> 20:25.325
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

20:25.392 --> 20:26.593
Oh!

20:26.659 --> 20:27.694
You got blocked.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.562
Yeah, it's okay.
It's okay.

20:29.629 --> 20:31.130
I have a new air ball.

20:31.197 --> 20:32.732
Out! Out! Other way!

20:32.799 --> 20:33.833
Oh, good.
That was good.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.735
Outlawed ball.
His fault.

20:35.802 --> 20:37.837
Oh, I messed up.
Sorry about that.

20:37.904 --> 20:40.473
You redeemed yourself
after an air ball!

20:40.540 --> 20:42.375
You can get a second chance.
Don't worry about it.

20:42.442 --> 20:43.776
That's like the
second time.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.144
You must feel bad,
but you'll get better.

20:45.211 --> 20:47.013
You've got too cute.
You just dribble.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.981
Positive energy, guys.

20:49.048 --> 20:51.484
Yeah! Yeah!
Good job. Good job.

20:51.551 --> 20:53.520
Yeah, you got me there.
You got me there.

20:53.586 --> 20:54.687
You got too cute.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.022
I have a new villain.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.425
New hero. New hero!

20:58.491 --> 20:59.826
Make sure you
at least hit the rim.

20:59.892 --> 21:01.361
I mean, I know you're sad.
Are you okay?

21:01.428 --> 21:03.396
Don't pass it to 42.
He air balls.

21:03.463 --> 21:04.531
It was pretty embarrassing.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.699
Go Lions!
I mean, two shots.
