ever gone before...

was goin'.

He was an exchange student
from France
who went to my school.

His name was Pierre,
and he was kinda different.

This school wasn't big enough
for the two of us,

01:27.054 --> 01:30.758

that his choices were
go home or die.

Pierre left the school,
the country
and never came back.

So I sent Pierre
a plane ticket...

to give America another try.

Oh, it's just my hand.

[ Earl Narrating ] The reason
Randy was hopin' Catalina
would like the night-light...

02:20.774 --> 02:23.344
was 'cause their relationship
had changed in a major way.

02:23.411 --> 02:28.216
After Catalina got deported,
Randy married her so she could
get back in the country.

Then they got an apartment,

she wants me to sleep there,

every time he started thinkin'
about sleepin' at Catalina's,

03:33.381 --> 03:35.349
I didn't know what
the French flag looked like,

to represent France.

Actually, Italy is
the one shaped like a boot.

Yeah, I don't think
I can draw that.

That's what happens when
you tell a man you love him.
What else could I do?

I didn't want to humiliate him
in front of all those people.

I gotta go talk to Pierre
before he gets on a plane.

14:04.377 --> 14:06.279
Just find a way
to let Randy down easy.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.782
Be honest,
and he'll understand.

14:09.849 --> 14:13.220
And when you talk to him, if
one of your breasts accidentally
falls out of your shirt,

14:13.286 --> 14:15.923
wouldn't be the worst thing
in the world.

Pierre wouldn't answer
when I knocked,

so I spent all night tryin'
to get his attention through
a bullet hole in the wall.

- Anytime. Guess what.

No. I just didn't
want to hurt him.

is more sensitive to hurtin'
people's feelings than me.

you need to do.

15:12.212 --> 15:13.981
You need to
have sex with him.

Mmm. This feels like the time
you told me the public pool
was topless.

15:18.318 --> 15:21.921
I forgot about that.
My boys still ask about you.

15:21.989 --> 15:25.058
No, this is serious.
Once I had to break up with
this dude from Quebec,

15:25.125 --> 15:28.295
but I didn't want to hurt
his feelings because he was
assistant manager at Sam Goody,

15:28.361 --> 15:30.763
and I was gettin'
all kinds of free cassettes.

15:30.830 --> 15:34.301
So I slept with him.
Only I made sure I was terrible
so he'd never want to again.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.436
You slept with a guy
for free cassettes?

15:36.503 --> 15:39.739

It was before CDs.

grow out a little.

he'll never want to
have sex with you again,

to being friends.
