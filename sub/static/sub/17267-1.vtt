WEBVTT

00:12.262 --> 00:15.139
(narrator)
They've been out
there for centuries.

00:17.475 --> 00:19.393
Lurking in the shadows.

00:21.730 --> 00:25.190
Rotting in our
stories and myths.

00:26.818 --> 00:28.861
And buried
in our nightmares.

00:30.572 --> 00:33.032
For the time will
come when monsters

00:33.116 --> 00:35.534
will shape the
fortunes of all.

00:38.580 --> 00:40.873
Tonight!

00:40.915 --> 00:44.710
The most highly
anticipated extreme
sporting event ever.

00:44.753 --> 00:46.712
[echoing voice]
Ever, ever, ever.

00:54.137 --> 00:56.764
Eight deadly monsters
summoned to the ring

00:56.848 --> 00:59.308
from all corners
of the Earth,

00:59.392 --> 01:02.936
fighting to the death
to determine the most
powerful ghoul of all time.

01:03.021 --> 01:05.773
[echoing]
Ghoul of all time.

01:20.663 --> 01:23.332
Fighting and monster
fans from across
the world,

01:23.416 --> 01:26.085
board up your windows
and put your kids to bed,

01:26.169 --> 01:29.171
for it's the ultimate
fight of the living dead.

01:29.255 --> 01:31.632
[echoing]
The living dead.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.810
This is Monster Brawl.

02:33.778 --> 02:36.572
(man)
Good evening monster
fans in Canada,

02:36.656 --> 02:40.242
Newfoundland and
the United States
of America.

02:40.326 --> 02:43.245
We're coming to you
live from the abandoned
and overgrown

02:43.329 --> 02:46.331
Hillside Necropolis
in central Michigan,

02:46.416 --> 02:50.919
and folks, we're about
to witness an unspeakable
war of attrition

02:51.004 --> 02:54.882
here at the first
ever Monster Brawl
main event.

02:54.966 --> 02:57.009
I'm Buzz Chambers,

02:57.093 --> 03:02.055
here with legendary former
champ, Sasquatch Sid Tucker.

03:02.140 --> 03:03.849
And tonight,
we present

03:03.892 --> 03:06.602
a shocking
and God-awful
fighting tournament

03:06.686 --> 03:10.439
featuring a roster
of the world's most
notorious ghouls,

03:10.523 --> 03:12.733
in what can
only be described

03:12.817 --> 03:15.694
as a showdown
for the ages.

03:15.778 --> 03:17.571
That's right, Buzz.

03:17.655 --> 03:20.741
This will be
a blood-curdling
battle to the death

03:20.825 --> 03:24.077
for our eight gruesome
and ghastly combatants.

03:24.162 --> 03:27.289
Now, the tournament
consists of two
conferences.

03:27.373 --> 03:29.875
The Undead and
the Creatures.

03:29.918 --> 03:33.128
Each conference
contains four
monsters.

03:33.213 --> 03:36.632
There are middleweight
contenders and the
heavyweights.

03:36.716 --> 03:39.551
Let's take a quick
look at our fighters.

03:39.636 --> 03:42.387
(narrator)
The Unread Conference.

03:43.556 --> 03:45.098
The Mummy.

03:45.183 --> 03:47.559
Lady Vampire.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.770
Zombie Man.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.689
Frankenstein.

03:52.774 --> 03:55.400
The Creatures Conference.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.611
Cyclops.

03:57.695 --> 03:59.905
Witch Bitch.

03:59.948 --> 04:02.115
Swamp Gut.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.576
Werewolf.

04:04.661 --> 04:09.081
Now, our opening fights
feature the middleweight
battles from each conference.

04:09.123 --> 04:12.000
And the division
titles are up
for grabs.

04:12.085 --> 04:16.338
First up from the Creatures,
is Cyclops vs. Witch Bitch.

04:16.422 --> 04:18.005
Then for the Undead

04:18.091 --> 04:21.343
it's Mummy
vs. Lady Vampire.

04:21.427 --> 04:24.179
The next round
of fights is our
heavyweight contests.

04:24.264 --> 04:28.183
For the Creatures
it's Swamp Gut pitted
against Werewolf.

04:28.268 --> 04:31.520
And for the Undead,
it's Frankenstein
vs. Zombie Man.

04:31.604 --> 04:34.439
The final fight
of the night will
have the contenders

04:34.482 --> 04:37.609
from each heavyweight
bout facing each other
in a bitter

04:37.694 --> 04:40.195
and grisly
end showdown.

04:40.280 --> 04:44.283
But first,
we welcome special
Monster Brawl dignitary,

04:44.367 --> 04:49.288
the perpetually
hyper "Mouth from
the South", Jimmy Hart.

04:49.372 --> 04:51.290
Come on baby,
step on it!
Step on it!

04:51.332 --> 04:53.292
I'm going to be late
for the Monster Brawl!

04:53.376 --> 04:55.961
Look, I promise you
III pay for the
speeding ticket.

04:56.004 --> 05:00.132
I promise! I promise!
Look, pal, I'm begging
you, step on it. Please.

05:00.174 --> 05:02.801
I'm going to turn
into a pumpkin if
you don't hurry.

05:02.844 --> 05:07.556
II right.
Come on, baby.
I think I'm gonna make it.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.183
Jimmy, glad you could
make it here tonight.

05:10.268 --> 05:11.977
How are you feeling?

05:12.061 --> 05:14.396
Guys, this is awesome!
I'm having a blast here.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.732
The monsters are
getting ready for
the fights.

05:16.816 --> 05:20.986
I just saw a graveyard
worker get their arms
ripped off by a zombie.

05:21.029 --> 05:23.572
We're in for a blistering,
bickering battle royal,

05:23.656 --> 05:25.866
a devastating,
disgusting donnybrook,

05:25.950 --> 05:28.827
and a freakish,
forlorn fracas.

05:28.911 --> 05:31.705
Hey Jimmy, give us
some background info
on this event.

05:31.789 --> 05:34.666
How the hell did
Monster Brawl come
to life, huh?

05:34.751 --> 05:37.419
This event started out
as just a crazy
old dream

05:37.503 --> 05:41.214
from an unemployed,
smalltime wresting
promoter named Jake Blackburn.

05:41.299 --> 05:44.926
He first devised this
idea over five years ago
from his parent's basement.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.929
I had a chance to catch up
with Blackburn earlier
in the week,

05:48.014 --> 05:50.223
and he had
this to say.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.768
Blackburn, I got
a few questions for
you, if you don't mind.

05:52.852 --> 05:54.936
Why don't you tell us
about yourself?

05:55.021 --> 05:58.357
I've always been
a geek when it comes to
wresting and monsters.

05:58.399 --> 06:00.942
I used to make
Kung Fu tournaments.

06:01.027 --> 06:03.904
I'd have all
my friends over, and
we'd beat each other up,

06:03.988 --> 06:07.407
and then we'd run inside and
watch monster movies and scare
the crap out of each other.

06:07.492 --> 06:10.952
Well, let me ask you this.
What in the world compelled
you to go down this path?

06:11.037 --> 06:13.205
I mean, why monsters?
Why-why wresting?

06:13.289 --> 06:15.374
Well, these things
are like my drugs, man.

06:15.458 --> 06:18.043
I mean, when everyone
else was out partying
on Friday nights,

06:18.127 --> 06:20.712
I'm sitting
at home watching
Japanese death matches

06:20.755 --> 06:23.215
and doodling
monsters fighting.

06:23.299 --> 06:26.134
As a local promoter,
I know it was tough.
You had a lot of struggles.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.595
Can you tell us
about it?

06:28.679 --> 06:31.556
It was tough.
We're going around with
wrestlers no one has heard of.

06:31.641 --> 06:34.393
lt kind of fizzled out.
But, uh, I went back
to the drawing board,

06:34.477 --> 06:37.104
that's when I started
thinking about the
big ideas.

06:37.188 --> 06:38.897
What about Las Vegas?

06:38.940 --> 06:42.734
Bright lights, big city,
sold-out crowds?

06:42.777 --> 06:46.154
It all came down to
affordability and keeping
the monsters comfortable.

06:46.239 --> 06:49.783
They don't wanna be in front of
big crowds with lots of lights
going off and stuff like that.

06:49.867 --> 06:52.828
There's a safety issue.
You don't want them ripping
arms off of people.

06:52.912 --> 06:56.248
That's when we came up
with the idea to have it
in a secret graveyard.

06:56.290 --> 06:58.750
We can show it to
the whole world.
It's perfect.

06:58.835 --> 07:02.003
How in the hell did you
recruit these monsters?

07:02.088 --> 07:03.672
Frankenstein?
Zombie?

07:03.756 --> 07:05.841
We're sending invites
all over the place.

07:05.925 --> 07:08.468
Some monsters
just caught wind
of what was going on.

07:08.553 --> 07:10.887
Some just showed
up out of nowhere,

07:10.972 --> 07:13.723
like they were summoned
here from the dark forces
we got in play.

07:13.808 --> 07:17.185
It's gonna be an amazing
battle, Jimmy, and to me it
doesn't matter who wins.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.813
It's all about the
journey getting here,
and it's been great.

07:19.897 --> 07:21.606
Well, there you
have it folks.

07:21.691 --> 07:24.276
The brains
behind the brawl.

07:24.318 --> 07:26.069
May I give you
some advice?

07:26.154 --> 07:28.196
If you make
some money, get you
a new suit, okay?

07:28.281 --> 07:29.531
All right.
Hey, good luck.

07:29.615 --> 07:31.199
All right,
thanks, Jimmy.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.535
We're back graveside,
with Cyril Haggard,

07:33.619 --> 07:36.705
the resident grave keeper
here at Hillside Necropolis.

07:36.789 --> 07:39.124
Cy, you know this
turf better than anyone.

07:39.167 --> 07:43.044
Why was this
particular cemetery
chosen as tonight's venue?

07:43.129 --> 07:44.713
[owl hoots]

07:44.797 --> 07:48.383
I told you to mind
your own business.

07:48.468 --> 07:52.804
I warned you not to go
messing with this place.

07:52.889 --> 07:57.642
Gotcha. We know
that the arena terrain
is mostly dead mulch

07:57.685 --> 08:01.980
and thick forest,
but are there any
environmental factors

08:02.023 --> 08:05.192
that might come
into play during
the fights tonight?

08:07.069 --> 08:09.696
The soil is
cursed, boy!

08:09.780 --> 08:12.991
You've gone
and stirred up
a heap of trouble.

08:13.075 --> 08:15.660
Something evil
has been unearthed,

08:15.703 --> 08:18.163
and I can feel it
in my bones.

08:18.247 --> 08:21.917
Evil. Evil!

08:22.001 --> 08:23.376
Evil.

08:23.461 --> 08:25.378
Sounds good, Cy.

08:25.463 --> 08:29.257
Thanks for dropping by
and we hope you enjoy
the fights.

08:29.342 --> 08:33.553
You bastards
are gonna pay
for what you've done.

08:33.638 --> 08:35.514
You're gonna pay.

08:35.556 --> 08:38.350
You're all doomed.

08:46.359 --> 08:50.612
Again, thanks for dropping
by, Cy, with that wonderful
bit of foreboding.

08:50.696 --> 08:53.615
I warned you this
place was cursed!

08:56.577 --> 09:00.038
And now,
before we preview
our opening match,

09:00.081 --> 09:04.709
Let's go live backstage
where legendary mixed
martial arts referee

09:04.794 --> 09:08.129
and official
Monster Brawl
officiator,

09:08.214 --> 09:11.216
Herb Dean
is standing by
to give us some details

09:11.259 --> 09:15.637
on the rules
and regulations for our
upcoming fights. Herb?

09:15.721 --> 09:17.973
Hey guys,
pleasure
to be here.

09:18.057 --> 09:20.600
Herb, what are your
thoughts on this event?

09:20.685 --> 09:23.728
It's unbelievable.
There's an eerie vibe
back here in the crypts

09:23.771 --> 09:25.605
where the monsters
are getting prepared.

09:25.690 --> 09:28.149
This night's gonna go
down in fighting history.

09:28.234 --> 09:32.153
What do you think about living
in a world where monsters must
fight to the death?

09:32.238 --> 09:35.323
I think it's great.
I hate monsters more
than anything.

09:35.408 --> 09:39.327
And the way I see it, there's
gonna be a few less monsters
in the world after tonight

09:39.412 --> 09:41.496
'cause some of them ain't
leaving this cemetery.

09:41.581 --> 09:45.250
What kind of rules
have been established
for this tournament?

09:45.293 --> 09:46.710
None.

09:46.794 --> 09:48.628
What, no rules
whatsoever?

09:48.713 --> 09:52.132
No, man.
No rules, no time
limits, no stoppages.

09:52.216 --> 09:55.176
The match will continue
until one of them loses
their life.

09:55.261 --> 09:58.179
I'm here to cut down
on the shots to the groin,

09:58.264 --> 10:00.265
manager interventions,
that sort of thing.

10:00.308 --> 10:02.350
Other than that,
standard death-match.

10:02.435 --> 10:05.645
That's wonderful.
We'll see you shortly
inside the ring.

10:05.730 --> 10:08.690
And we'll take
our first break
here at the graveyard

10:08.774 --> 10:12.444
and be right back
with the opening
fight of the evening.

10:17.742 --> 10:20.660
(narrator)
lonian Islands, Greece.

10:36.469 --> 10:39.721
[neck bones crack]

10:40.890 --> 10:43.308
[hollow growling]

10:58.157 --> 11:00.241
[knocking]

11:01.535 --> 11:02.827
Enter.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.333
An urgent message
for you, Sir.

11:15.216 --> 11:17.008
Who sent you?

11:17.093 --> 11:18.677
A shadow
from the West.

11:18.761 --> 11:20.553
There's a storm brewing.

11:20.638 --> 11:24.015
Monsters the world
over have been summoned.

11:25.851 --> 11:27.769
So, the hour
is upon us.

11:44.203 --> 11:47.622
My training will
begin at dawn.

11:50.042 --> 11:54.796
Almost 3000 years ago,
I made a terrible mistake.

11:54.880 --> 11:58.425
I made a fateful deal
with the evil god Hades.

11:58.509 --> 12:03.888
In return for one
of my eyes, he grant
me power to see future.

12:03.973 --> 12:06.433
I can foretell
the deaths of others.

12:06.517 --> 12:10.729
I went into hiding,
ashamed and without
honor.

12:10.771 --> 12:13.064
[grunting]

12:13.107 --> 12:15.150
Now, a force
beckons me

12:15.234 --> 12:17.944
that is more
powerful  than anything.

12:19.321 --> 12:21.448
[grunts]

12:23.159 --> 12:24.951
If you can see
the future,

12:25.035 --> 12:28.830
you must already
know the outcome
of the battle.

12:28.914 --> 12:34.127
Honor is like an island.
Rugged and without shores.

12:34.211 --> 12:37.422
Once you leave,
you can never return.

12:37.465 --> 12:38.757
[shouts]

12:41.385 --> 12:44.095
(narrator)
Buzzard's Bay,
Massachusetts.

12:48.726 --> 12:51.770
Witch!
You ought to be
burned to the ground.

12:51.812 --> 12:54.272
You're the worst
witch ever .

12:54.356 --> 12:56.941
Witch!

12:56.984 --> 12:58.985
You're a witch.

12:59.069 --> 13:00.320
Bitch.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.866
[shouting]

13:07.411 --> 13:09.120
[crying]

13:11.916 --> 13:13.625
[knocking on door]

13:13.709 --> 13:15.543
Go away!

13:22.301 --> 13:23.968
What do you want?

13:24.011 --> 13:26.429
I'm known
around these
parts as the Grub.

13:26.472 --> 13:28.473
The Grub?

13:28.516 --> 13:31.351
That's right.
Professional monster
bodyguard and manager.

13:31.435 --> 13:33.186
Who sent you here?

13:33.270 --> 13:36.147
Listen.
I caught whispers of
a secret tournament

13:36.190 --> 13:37.649
for people
like yourself.

13:37.691 --> 13:39.901
Piss off, troll!

13:39.985 --> 13:43.029
Wait a minute!
They are holding a monster
fighting event next month,

13:43.113 --> 13:45.240
and I need
a fighter.

13:45.324 --> 13:48.535
We'll make you
the most powerful menace
the world has ever seen.

13:48.619 --> 13:52.372
No more witch hunts.
The townsfolk will
bow to you.

13:52.456 --> 13:56.042
Well, don't
just stand there.
Come inside.

14:02.967 --> 14:08.555
Now, tell me again how
I'm supposed to stand up
to the rest of these monsters?

14:10.766 --> 14:14.060
I've trained the most
disagreeable monsters
in the entire universe.

14:14.144 --> 14:17.522
But you, you could go
all the way to the top!

14:17.565 --> 14:21.025
Picture this.
Diabolical outcast
from small village

14:21.068 --> 14:23.278
wins Monster Brawl.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.865
[people cheering]

14:30.703 --> 14:33.288
You will have
your vengeance.

14:33.372 --> 14:36.624
Everyone who spit
on you, heckled you,

14:36.709 --> 14:38.960
beat and raped you.

14:39.044 --> 14:40.712
But I can't fight!

14:40.754 --> 14:42.088
Nonsense!

14:44.758 --> 14:47.886
Forget all the
necromancy crap.
The conjury.

14:47.970 --> 14:49.637
The dark magic.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.139
[all cheering]

14:51.223 --> 14:53.641
You have
to become
a warrior!

15:01.817 --> 15:04.777
Now, if we only had
the proper name for you,

15:04.862 --> 15:09.073
that would instill
terror into the heart
of your opponent.

15:09.158 --> 15:12.118
[people chanting]
Witch Bitch.

15:12.202 --> 15:15.288
Witch Bitch.
Witch Bitch.
Witch Bitch.

15:17.082 --> 15:20.126
Witch Bitch.

15:20.210 --> 15:23.421
Creatures Conference
Middleweight Title Match.

15:23.505 --> 15:26.007
Cyclops vs. Witch Bitch.

15:26.091 --> 15:29.636
We're back, ladies
and gentlemen, with our
opening bout of the evening.

15:29.720 --> 15:32.138
Now we're ready to get
this brawl underway Buzz,

15:32.222 --> 15:34.474
and what a
first match-up.

15:34.558 --> 15:37.518
We have the one-eyed
ancient warrior Cyclops

15:37.603 --> 15:41.356
going head-to-head
against the uncomely,
Witch Bitch.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.691
Let's go to our
fight preview.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.860
(narrator)
Cyclops.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.863
Normally Cyclops
would not fight women.

15:48.948 --> 15:52.283
But this Witch
is a bitch.

15:52.368 --> 15:54.285
And I will
crush her!

15:54.370 --> 15:56.537
And Hades is next!

15:56.622 --> 15:58.873
The Cyclops is a
mythical creature.

15:58.958 --> 16:02.543
He comes from a long line
of one-eyed blacksmiths,

16:02.628 --> 16:06.631
and he's fought nearly
everything that's ever
walked or crawled.

16:06.715 --> 16:08.633
He's trained
in fighting systems

16:08.717 --> 16:12.136
varying from
Roman Empire
gladiator tactics

16:12.179 --> 16:15.515
to Greco-Spartan
field combat.

16:15.599 --> 16:19.894
In fact, he has the ability
to eradicate entire villages

16:19.979 --> 16:23.648
with his special laser
beam eye maneuver.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.733
(narrator)
Witch Bitch.

16:25.818 --> 16:29.696
Listen up, Cyclops!
You Grub-wannabe bastard!

16:29.780 --> 16:31.906
We've got some tricks
in store for you.

16:31.991 --> 16:36.077
A whole bag of them,
so keep your eye open.

16:36.161 --> 16:38.913
Witch Bitch
is a grizzled
and vile occultist,

16:38.998 --> 16:43.501
capable of conjuring
dark spirits and fatal
spell attacks.

16:43.544 --> 16:46.379
And was once part
of a Witch/Warlock
tag team

16:46.463 --> 16:49.757
until her partner was
burned at the stake.

16:49.842 --> 16:54.095
She's also been taken
under the wing of
monster bodyguard

16:54.179 --> 16:57.056
and acne-smitten
troll, the Grub,

16:57.141 --> 16:59.392
who has trained and
conditioned Witch Bitch

16:59.476 --> 17:02.186
in the weeks
leading up to
tonight's event.

17:02.271 --> 17:05.189
And now, we turn it
over to Jimmy Hart

17:05.273 --> 17:09.318
to summon
the creatures
from the crypts.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.890
Ladies and gentlemen,
coming to you live

17:38.974 --> 17:41.934
from the Hillside
Necropolis in Emmett,
County Michigan,

17:42.019 --> 17:45.229
the Monster Brawl
Creatures Conference
Middleweight Showdown.

17:45.314 --> 17:48.441
Introducing first,
fighting out of
the stone crypt,

17:48.525 --> 17:51.903
a mythical one-eyed
brute from lonia, Greece.

17:51.945 --> 17:56.282
Weighing in at 280 pounds,
the legendary, the ageless

17:56.366 --> 17:58.868
Cyclops!

18:05.626 --> 18:09.087
[growls]

18:13.550 --> 18:16.094
And his opponent,
fighting out of
the wood crypt,

18:16.136 --> 18:17.929
weighing in
at  134 pounds.

18:17.971 --> 18:19.931
From Buzzard's Bay,
Massachusetts,

18:20.015 --> 18:22.183
the bane
of New England,
the infernal,

18:22.267 --> 18:26.771
the unhallowed,
the villainous
sorceress Witch Bitch.

18:40.244 --> 18:43.663
And let's take
a quick peak at our
Tale of the Tape, Buzz,

18:43.747 --> 18:46.040
and see how these
fighters match up.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.543
The Cyclops has
a formidable record

18:48.627 --> 18:53.047
and easily tops
Witch Bitch in
strength and size.

18:55.551 --> 18:59.387
Herb Dean is making
his way out to the ring
area through the archway,

18:59.471 --> 19:02.265
and what a
class-act individual

19:02.307 --> 19:05.393
and stellar representative
of monster fighting.

19:05.477 --> 19:09.063
And the anticipation
mounting inside
the graveyard

19:09.148 --> 19:11.482
is about to explode.

19:11.567 --> 19:15.486
And this is the biggest
event in the history
of physical combat,

19:15.529 --> 19:19.532
and I just hope my voice
holds up for this, Buzz!

19:21.618 --> 19:23.244
All right guys,
center up.

19:23.328 --> 19:25.163
And if I'm
Herb Dean, Buzz,

19:25.247 --> 19:27.248
I'd get the hell out
of that ring in a hurry.

19:27.332 --> 19:30.251
We've gone over
the rules. Protect
yourself at all times.

19:30.335 --> 19:33.004
Follow my instructions.
We're gonna have a
clean fight.

19:33.088 --> 19:35.548
Touch gloves, Let's
make it official.

19:35.632 --> 19:39.093
It's the one and only time
these athletes will ever
face each other,

19:39.178 --> 19:42.096
and it's winner
takes all.

19:42.181 --> 19:45.433
The loser must
leave this world.

19:45.517 --> 19:46.934
You ready to fight?

19:47.019 --> 19:49.020
You ready?

19:49.104 --> 19:50.771
Let's do it.

19:55.819 --> 19:58.696
And we're underway
here at Monster Brawl

19:58.780 --> 20:02.575
as Cyclops and Witch Bitch
engage in a brutal
bloodbath

20:02.659 --> 20:05.703
for the Creatures Conference
middleweight title.

20:07.664 --> 20:09.957
Cyclops misses
with a quick lunge

20:10.042 --> 20:13.377
as Witch Bitch
gingerly slingshots
him into the ropes

20:13.462 --> 20:17.381
and answers
with a clothesline.

20:22.304 --> 20:25.223
Look out!
Witch Bitch with a
dirty kick to the dick

20:25.307 --> 20:29.310
sends the ancient ogre
reeling to the canvas mat.

20:29.394 --> 20:32.480
And Herb Dean
has a word with
the Witch

20:32.564 --> 20:35.441
regarding that
ball-busting maneuver.

20:35.525 --> 20:39.195
That was a groin shot.
You need to keep it clean.
We're not gonna have that.

20:39.279 --> 20:41.739
All right,
you ready?
Fight!

20:41.782 --> 20:45.576
Cyclops pulls out
a sledgehammer and
blindsides Witch Bitch

20:45.661 --> 20:47.954
with a big backhand
hit to the face.

20:48.038 --> 20:49.747
(narrator)
Incredible.

20:49.790 --> 20:52.959
And she's in serious
trouble now, Sid.

20:53.043 --> 20:57.922
And Herb Dean clearly
appalled by the action
happening in the ring.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.967
The Grub is
in disbelief, and now
he's entering the ring

21:01.051 --> 21:04.345
to mount an intervention
on behalf of his mangled
protege.

21:04.429 --> 21:08.349
The Grub
broadsides Cyclops
with a folding chair,

21:08.433 --> 21:12.603
and this fight is
descending into
a circus, Sid.

21:12.646 --> 21:15.773
And Herb Dean appears
ready to disqualify
Witch Bitch

21:15.857 --> 21:18.776
as he lectures the Grub
at the side of the ring.

21:21.905 --> 21:24.115
And Witch Bitch pushes
aside her manager

21:24.199 --> 21:27.785
and slices Herb Dean's
neck with a rusty cleaver!

21:27.869 --> 21:31.122
Oh, good Lord!
Folks, Herb Dean has
been seriously injured

21:31.164 --> 21:32.665
as he flops out
of the ring!

21:38.714 --> 21:41.007
Unbelievable!

21:41.091 --> 21:45.636
Monster Brawl ref
Herb Dean is dead
at the age of 40!

21:45.679 --> 21:48.055
And we're going
to have to proceed

21:48.140 --> 21:51.726
throughout the rest
of the night with no
officiator, Sid.

21:51.810 --> 21:53.644
Look, no more
grieving, Buzz.

21:53.729 --> 21:56.022
We're missing
the action in
the ring.

21:56.106 --> 21:59.650
And the Cyclops
with a heavy blow to
the head of Witch Bitch,

21:59.693 --> 22:01.569
sending her
into the turnbuckle

22:01.653 --> 22:04.739
where he lets loose
a couple of heavy punches.

22:04.823 --> 22:10.161
And Witch Bitch with a sneaky
dodge as she batters Cyclops
with a shoulder to the chest.

22:12.205 --> 22:15.333
Cyclops grabs
Witch Bitch by
the neck.

22:15.417 --> 22:17.001
[grunts]

22:18.503 --> 22:20.588
(narrator)
Fantastic.

22:24.009 --> 22:27.386
And a sensational
reversal by Witch Bitch.

22:27.471 --> 22:31.849
And Buzz, the Grub
hands her a bottle of
moonshine or something

22:31.933 --> 22:34.685
and she's happily
indulging in it.

22:34.728 --> 22:38.189
She's bitching up
for something big, Sid.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.942
And the Witch
humiliating the Cyclops

22:42.027 --> 22:45.613
as she spews that
Bitch's brew all
over him.

22:45.697 --> 22:49.116
Look out!
She's going in
for an eye-gouge.

22:49.201 --> 22:52.036
Cyclops in serious
danger now

22:52.120 --> 22:55.706
as Witch Bitch
pries at his
exposed eyeball.

22:55.791 --> 23:00.878
It's all fun
and games until
someone loses their eye.

23:00.962 --> 23:03.714
And the Cyclops
is going nuts!

23:03.757 --> 23:07.635
He's amassing an energy
force around his eyeball.

23:07.719 --> 23:11.138
Cyclops possesses powers
older than time itself,

23:11.223 --> 23:14.266
and he was hesitant
to use this weapon,
but enough is enough.

23:14.351 --> 23:16.977
It's time for this
bitch to pay!

23:18.230 --> 23:20.773
[yelling]

23:25.487 --> 23:30.408
And Cyclops unloads
a devastating laser
beam attack,

23:30.492 --> 23:33.244
scorching the face
of Witch Bitch !

23:33.286 --> 23:36.122
That was a
face-melting finish.

23:36.206 --> 23:38.416
Wow!

23:39.960 --> 23:41.752
(narrator)
Cyclops wins.

23:41.837 --> 23:44.130
Mythical laser blast.

23:44.214 --> 23:47.174
Ding dong,
the Witch is dead.

23:47.259 --> 23:52.847
She'll find a final
resting place here
at Hillside Necropolis.

23:52.931 --> 23:56.767
Cyclops parades
around the ring,
basking in the victory.

23:56.852 --> 23:59.019
Cyclops wins!

23:59.104 --> 24:03.357
[grunting]

24:03.442 --> 24:07.862
And now the Grub enters
the ring to steal some
thunder from Cyclops.

24:07.946 --> 24:11.949
He wants a piece
of the one-eyed monster.

24:12.033 --> 24:15.161
Oh, my God!
The Grub gets his
head knocked right off

24:15.245 --> 24:19.957
as Cyclops unloads
a heavy blow that
literally decapitates

24:20.041 --> 24:21.625
the veteran
monster manager.

24:21.710 --> 24:23.627
[grunts]

24:23.670 --> 24:27.631
Hades!
You're next!

24:27.716 --> 24:30.384
I Love this! I Love it!
I Love it! I Love it!

24:30.469 --> 24:35.306
Look at this. Cyclops
just scorched Witch Bitch
with a laser beam!

24:35.348 --> 24:37.850
And look
at Herb Dean.
He's dead!

24:37.934 --> 24:40.561
I hate referees anyhow.
They are no use
for anything.

24:40.645 --> 24:46.984
Trust me on that, girls.
And the winner of the
match is Cyclops!

24:47.027 --> 24:49.737
A convincing win
for the Cyclops,

24:49.821 --> 24:54.700
as he takes the crown for
the Creature Conference
middleweight title.

24:54.784 --> 24:59.747
That's right, Buzz.
The dead are gone, and
the Brawl must go on.

24:59.831 --> 25:02.750
We'll be right back
to preview our
next fight,

25:02.834 --> 25:07.713
this time from the
Undead Conference.

25:07.797 --> 25:12.176
(narrator)
Metropolitan Museum,
New York City.

25:48.213 --> 25:50.631
[humming]

26:25.709 --> 26:28.419
[choking]

26:40.098 --> 26:43.100
Good evening,
ladies  and gentlemen,
this is Chris Chilton

26:43.184 --> 26:46.979
with a special
B Channel News alert for
the Greater New York area.

26:47.063 --> 26:50.441
Authorities have confirmed
that a reanimated mummy
has escaped

26:50.483 --> 26:54.194
from the Metropolitan
Museum after killing
a forklift operator.

26:54.279 --> 26:58.282
Experts believe
the mummy might be the
fabled  4000-year-old remains

26:58.366 --> 27:01.869
of King Khafra, a brutal
and vicious Pharaoh.

27:01.953 --> 27:05.623
The entire Tri-state area
is now under an orange
terror alert

27:05.665 --> 27:08.876
as the undead monster
roams the streets aimlessly.

27:08.960 --> 27:13.547
Our cameras caught up
with the Sheriff in front
of the museum earlier today.

27:13.632 --> 27:16.300
It's our belief that
he's headed somewhere.

27:16.343 --> 27:20.054
Something evil
has compelled him
from the grave.

27:20.138 --> 27:23.390
I encourage all citizens
to remain on high alert.

27:23.475 --> 27:26.477
And if you see that
mummy, you all give me
a call now, you hear?

27:28.813 --> 27:31.690
(narrator)
Felldorf, Transylvania.

27:36.446 --> 27:38.739
(Dunn)
This is special
agent Laurence Dunn,

27:38.823 --> 27:42.368
voice memorandum 19F81 .

27:42.452 --> 27:45.120
Operation Holy Water.

27:45.205 --> 27:49.333
I have succeeded at traversing
the Carpathian Mountains over
the last nine days,

27:49.417 --> 27:54.171
and I have arrived
at a mysterious and
seemingly abandoned estate

27:54.255 --> 27:57.675
not far from the
village of Felldorf.

27:57.717 --> 28:00.386
The local peasants
implored me not to
go any further,

28:00.470 --> 28:02.680
saying that the land
is unhallowed.

28:02.764 --> 28:05.849
And there have been
several recent killings
by a murderer in the night.

28:05.892 --> 28:09.061
The villagers said
things that have happened
here must not be known.

28:09.145 --> 28:11.522
After I heard enough
of their Gypsy crap,

28:11.606 --> 28:15.192
I followed the trail hard
to have a look for myself.

28:15.235 --> 28:16.860
That trail ends here.

28:24.202 --> 28:27.621
[grandfather clock ticking]

28:34.754 --> 28:38.298
[clock striking the hour]

28:49.185 --> 28:53.063
Madam, I'm agent
Laurence Dunn.

28:53.106 --> 28:55.065
I need to ask you
a few questions.

29:02.073 --> 29:05.743
Excuse me,
is that blood
you're drinking?

29:09.998 --> 29:12.958
This estate
originally belonged
to Vlad the Impaler.

29:13.042 --> 29:15.252
Is that correct?

29:19.090 --> 29:20.841
How long have
you lived here?

29:20.925 --> 29:22.301
Forever.

29:22.385 --> 29:24.094
I'm the last
of my kind.

29:24.137 --> 29:27.097
Doomed to immortality.

29:29.893 --> 29:32.019
The villagers have
accused you of murder.

29:32.103 --> 29:34.271
I have
to take you in.

29:37.358 --> 29:38.942
[gunshot]

29:55.502 --> 29:57.211
[Dunn shouts]

29:59.422 --> 30:01.757
[shouts]

30:04.427 --> 30:07.846
(narrator)
Undead Conference
Middleweight Title Match.

30:07.931 --> 30:10.891
Lady Vampire
vs. the Mummy.

30:10.975 --> 30:13.185
Welcome back to
the program, folks.

30:13.269 --> 30:18.398
I'm Buzz Chambers,
here with living
legend Sasquatch Sid,

30:18.483 --> 30:20.984
and we're set
for the next fight
of the evening,

30:21.027 --> 30:24.404
this one featuring
two undead icons.

30:24.489 --> 30:26.532
(narrator)
Lady Vampire.

30:26.616 --> 30:29.409
I dream of
a glorious death,

30:29.494 --> 30:32.246
but no monster
is a match

30:32.330 --> 30:33.997
for the eternal one.

30:34.040 --> 30:36.750
The Mummy
will be destroyed.

30:36.835 --> 30:39.002
[hissing]

30:39.087 --> 30:42.172
Lady Vampire has
a lifetime record

30:42.215 --> 30:47.344
that has spanned over
six centuries, dating
back to the year 1 381 .

30:47.387 --> 30:49.763
She's virtually immortal.

30:49.848 --> 30:53.016
And an expert with
XIV century fisticuffs.

30:53.059 --> 30:56.186
She's a cold-blooded
professional killer,

30:56.229 --> 31:00.774
and I hope the Mummy
is carrying some garlic
or holy water, Buzz,

31:00.859 --> 31:03.193
'cause this is
a bit of a mismatch.

31:03.278 --> 31:07.197
Lady Vampire
is a big favorite
going into this brawl.

31:07.240 --> 31:09.283
(narrator)
The Mummy.

31:09.367 --> 31:12.744
[grunting]

31:17.917 --> 31:20.544
Although feeble
and frail,

31:20.628 --> 31:24.298
the Mummy presents an
interesting challenge
to Lady Vampire.

31:24.382 --> 31:26.884
As an Egyptian Pharaoh,

31:26.968 --> 31:30.721
he must have undergone
some form of military
training in his past life.

31:30.763 --> 31:33.974
Regardless, we expect
to see a lifeless,

31:34.058 --> 31:38.061
shuffling wraith
in action tonight.

31:38.146 --> 31:41.565
His bandages
might be battered
and bedraggled,

31:41.608 --> 31:44.943
and his skeletal
interior very vulnerable,

31:45.028 --> 31:47.279
but mark
my words, people.

31:47.363 --> 31:50.616
We're dealing with a former
tyrant of ancient Egypt,

31:50.700 --> 31:53.952
and he's gotta have
a couple of tricks
up his sleeve.

31:54.037 --> 31:57.915
It's time for the Undead
Conference Middleweight
Division title match.

31:57.999 --> 32:01.585
Introducing first,
weighing in at 127 pounds,

32:01.669 --> 32:05.756
from the far outreaches
of the Carpathian Mountains
in Transylvania,

32:05.798 --> 32:08.175
the eternal
champion of blood lust,

32:08.259 --> 32:12.429
Lady Vampire!

32:23.483 --> 32:26.151
And her opponent,
from the Valley
of the Kings,

32:26.235 --> 32:30.280
the Hexecutioner,
the rotten wraith
of the ring,

32:30.323 --> 32:32.616
the cursed,
snake-bitten,

32:32.700 --> 32:38.830
King Khafra,
the Mummy!

32:50.718 --> 32:54.221
I gotta say, I'm pulling
for the Vampire in this
fight, Sid.

32:54.305 --> 32:57.557
I'll be damned before
I cheer for a mummy.

32:57.642 --> 33:00.894
I've hated mummies
my whole life.

33:10.321 --> 33:12.489
And taking a look
at these numbers, Buzz,

33:12.532 --> 33:15.826
the fighters line up
very closely with
one another,

33:15.910 --> 33:21.081
both being ancient
undead icons with very
similar vital stats.

33:21.165 --> 33:23.834
Strap yourself in,
Sasquatch Sid.

33:23.876 --> 33:27.004
We're set for this
unspeakable undead
ultimatum.

33:27.046 --> 33:30.507
For the winner,
the middleweight
Conference Championship.

33:30.550 --> 33:33.552
For the vanquished,
a bitter harvest.

33:33.636 --> 33:37.222
And we're in
for some extreme
undead action here, Buzz.

33:37.306 --> 33:43.186
Two ancient adversaries
meeting in bloody battle
for the first and only time.

33:43.271 --> 33:46.189
And the combatants lock up
in the center of the ring.

33:46.232 --> 33:49.067
She goes to town on
his battered torso,

33:49.152 --> 33:54.072
delivering a torrent
of kicks to the frail
frame of the Mummy.

33:54.157 --> 33:57.200
And the Mummy with a
retaliatory headbutt.

33:57.243 --> 33:59.745
And the Mummy starting
to show signs of life.

33:59.829 --> 34:03.874
That was an aggressive
body-slam by the mangled
monarch.

34:03.958 --> 34:08.962
And he throws in a
big kick to the gut of
Lady Vampire for good measure.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.882
Lady Vampire
delivers a right elbow,

34:11.924 --> 34:16.094
followed by a big
left hook, and then
another big right!

34:16.179 --> 34:19.598
( narrator)
Glorious combo.

34:19.681 --> 34:22.141
The Mummy is up to
something here, Buzz.

34:22.226 --> 34:25.270
He's fumbling around
with his bandages.

34:25.353 --> 34:27.773
And he throws
a fistful of dust

34:27.857 --> 34:31.777
into the eyes
of the Nosferatu.

34:31.860 --> 34:35.112
Watch out!
The Mummy locks
Lady Vampire

34:35.197 --> 34:38.742
into a merciless
sleeper hold submission.

34:41.370 --> 34:45.415
How anyone could withstand
that degree of asphyxiation
is beyond me.

34:45.500 --> 34:48.335
It's lights out
for Lady Vampire.

34:48.418 --> 34:51.254
She's drifted
into the darkness.

34:51.297 --> 34:54.091
And the Mummy
in prime position
to win this contest.

34:54.132 --> 34:56.510
The Mummy now
exits the ring area,

34:56.594 --> 34:59.471
and is shuffling over
towards the wood crypt.

34:59.555 --> 35:03.266
That filthy Mummy
is up to no good, Sid.

35:03.351 --> 35:05.936
Keep in mind, Buzz,
it is very difficult

35:05.978 --> 35:08.271
to kill something
that's already dead.

35:08.314 --> 35:10.982
This is a risky
delay by the Mummy.

35:11.067 --> 35:16.988
And the Mummy has gone
and grabbed what looks like
a wooden stake from the crypt

35:17.073 --> 35:20.617
and is making his way
back towards the ring.

35:20.701 --> 35:24.287
And with no ref,
all foreign objects
are fair game, Buzz.

35:24.372 --> 35:27.165
A smart weapon of choice
on behalf of the Mummy.

35:27.250 --> 35:29.793
We've underestimated
this rotting Pharaoh.

35:29.836 --> 35:33.463
He must be trained in
vampire-slaying techniques.

35:33.548 --> 35:37.217
Back in the ring,
the Mummy stalks
over Lady Vampire,

35:37.301 --> 35:39.970
raising that stake
for the finisher.

35:40.054 --> 35:44.641
Holy jumping Jesus,
she awakens in the
nick of time!

35:44.684 --> 35:48.061
She's revamped now, Sid,
and on the attack as
she moves in

35:48.146 --> 35:51.398
with a clothesline
into the turnbuckle.

35:51.482 --> 35:55.569
And Lady Vampire
lines him up with
a devastating bulldog,

35:55.653 --> 35:59.364
face-planting the frazzled
Pharaoh into the mat.

35:59.448 --> 36:03.660
How in God's name
are those bandages
holding up, Sid?

36:03.744 --> 36:06.329
Embalming is a
fine art, Buzz.

36:06.372 --> 36:08.915
He's been wrapped in
that crap for centuries.

36:09.000 --> 36:13.503
And Lady Vampire
slingshots the Mummy
into the corner.

36:13.546 --> 36:17.883
The Mummy is reaching
for his medallion hanging
on the corner of the ring.

36:17.967 --> 36:22.512
The former king appears
to be holding some type
of ancient sun relic.

36:22.555 --> 36:24.598
(narrator)
Majestic.

36:24.682 --> 36:27.684
The Mummy deploys
a blistering sun
curse technique

36:27.727 --> 36:30.854
that scorches the
face of the Vampire.

36:30.897 --> 36:35.692
A timely retaliation
of twisted alchemy
from the Pharaoh.

36:35.735 --> 36:38.612
And the action moves
into the cemetery

36:38.696 --> 36:43.700
as Lady Vampire pursues
her opponent outside
the ring.

36:43.743 --> 36:48.496
And quick jab followed by
a push kick sends the Mummy
reeling to the ground.

36:52.585 --> 36:57.547
Lady Vampire picks up
a granite tombstone,
and look out!

36:57.632 --> 37:00.425
She just hammered it
over the skull
of the Mummy!

37:00.509 --> 37:03.011
That must have weighed
200 pounds, Sid.

37:03.095 --> 37:06.723
Some serious grindhouse
action happening over in
the graveyard, Buzz.

37:06.807 --> 37:11.228
I haven't seen a
tombstone smash
in 25 years.

37:11.270 --> 37:14.439
She picks up
the weakened
corpse of the Mummy.

37:14.523 --> 37:18.485
Lady Vampire has just
ripped the black heart

37:18.569 --> 37:20.570
right out of
the Mummy's body.

37:20.613 --> 37:23.490
(narrator)
Lady Vampire wins.

37:23.574 --> 37:26.660
Black heart removal.

37:26.744 --> 37:28.912
That was phenomenal!

37:28.955 --> 37:31.248
Did you see that, girls?
Of course you did.

37:31.332 --> 37:36.586
Ladies and gentlemen,
the winner of the match
is Lady Vampire!

37:36.671 --> 37:38.922
Unbelievable.

37:39.006 --> 37:42.634
Look at her
preening to the world,
holding that black heart.

37:42.718 --> 37:45.804
She wins
the Undead Conference
Middleweight title,

37:45.888 --> 37:49.015
and can return
home triumphant,

37:49.100 --> 37:51.851
and get back to killing
Gypsies in the night.

37:51.936 --> 37:55.188
So long, Mummy.
Back to the grave you go.

37:55.273 --> 37:57.691
Stay tuned, folks.
We'll be right back

37:57.775 --> 37:59.985
with our first heavyweight
match of the evening.

38:00.069 --> 38:01.695
You're watching
Monster Brawl,

38:01.779 --> 38:04.823
the ultimate fight
of the living dead.

38:07.535 --> 38:11.037
(narrator)
Silver Springs,
New Jersey.

38:38.816 --> 38:41.109
[woman screaming]

38:49.035 --> 38:50.744
No!

39:33.662 --> 39:36.206
[growling]

39:46.008 --> 39:47.967
[gunshot]

40:04.360 --> 40:07.028
[groaning]

40:20.084 --> 40:22.836
[howling]

40:33.681 --> 40:36.683
(narrator)
Marshfield, Louisiana.

40:38.352 --> 40:41.020
Over 1 0% of
the Earth's landmass

40:41.105 --> 40:45.150
is covered by festering,
impenetrable marshlands.

40:45.234 --> 40:47.777
The Mississippi Bayou.

40:47.820 --> 40:51.322
Home to over 30,000
species of wildlife.

40:51.407 --> 40:53.783
This vast
boggy wasteland

40:53.826 --> 40:59.038
is also home to one
of the most bizarre
and disgusting creatures

40:59.123 --> 41:01.499
in the whole world.

41:01.584 --> 41:03.960
The Louisiana Swamp Gut.

41:04.044 --> 41:09.716
The undisputed king
of all reptilian
bog-dwellers.

41:09.800 --> 41:13.678
Swamp Gut is one
with his nebulous
surroundings.

41:13.762 --> 41:15.305
[growls]

41:15.389 --> 41:17.724
So toxic is his
slime and venom,

41:17.808 --> 41:21.686
that it changes
the very composition
of the bayou atmosphere.

41:24.106 --> 41:28.318
Humans are frequent
casualties of the harsh
and cursed swampland,

41:28.360 --> 41:34.699
and this Swamp Gut is
not above scavenging
from a corpse.

41:34.783 --> 41:39.746
Good friends
are hard to find
these days for Swamp Gut.

41:49.840 --> 41:54.344
Signs of the enemy
are detected and
examined closely.

41:54.428 --> 41:56.721
[growling]

41:56.805 --> 42:00.892
Fishing in these nefarious
waters is nearly suicidal.

42:00.976 --> 42:07.440
Swamp Gut has developed
a savage combat technique
for such reckless adventurers.

42:07.525 --> 42:10.193
[growls]

42:12.446 --> 42:16.032
Swamp Gut's deadly
slime attack is so toxic,

42:16.116 --> 42:20.203
that it paralyzes the
fisherman's nervous
system instantly.

42:20.246 --> 42:26.709
This solitary creature
may never see another
of his kind again.

42:26.752 --> 42:29.462
Not only is
his prey seasonal.

42:29.547 --> 42:31.965
It's also very
hard to find.

42:32.049 --> 42:36.636
Only the most
bumbling mammals, like
this unsuspecting canoeist,

42:36.720 --> 42:40.390
dare to traverse such
deadly waterways
of the world.

42:40.474 --> 42:44.477
He is oblivious to
the approaching danger.

42:48.399 --> 42:51.985
The hunt is on.

42:52.069 --> 42:56.447
The canoeist doesn't stand
a chance against such
a formidable opponent.

42:56.532 --> 42:59.826
There are under ten
Swamp Guts left in the wild,

42:59.910 --> 43:02.579
and that number
is falling.

43:02.663 --> 43:06.916
Like so many creatures,
the Guts have been pushed to
the very edge of extinction

43:07.001 --> 43:09.419
by the destruction
of their habitat.

43:09.461 --> 43:12.964
(narrator)
Creature Conference
Heavyweight Title Match.

43:13.048 --> 43:15.758
Swamp Gut vs. Werewolf.

43:15.801 --> 43:18.011
Welcome back
to the program, folks.

43:18.095 --> 43:20.430
He's Sasquatch Sid,
I'm Buzz Chambers,

43:20.472 --> 43:23.808
and we're ready
to set up the next
fight of the evening.

43:23.892 --> 43:28.521
For this match we have
our first Heavyweight
division title up for grabs

43:28.606 --> 43:31.107
coming from
the Creatures
Conference.

43:31.150 --> 43:33.192
(narrator)
Werewolf.

43:33.277 --> 43:36.779
Swamp Gut!
I know you've
been hearing it,

43:36.822 --> 43:39.699
walking through
the swamp with that
big gut of yours.

43:39.783 --> 43:42.952
You must have been
hearing it. All the frogs
have been saying it,

43:43.037 --> 43:46.122
all the toads,
all the creepy crawlers
have been saying it.

43:46.165 --> 43:48.166
Here comes the Wolf.

43:48.250 --> 43:52.337
The Werewolf was once
a simple man who was
viciously mauled

43:52.421 --> 43:58.134
by a rabid lobo
and became infected
by the dreadful wolf bane.

43:58.177 --> 44:01.054
Werewolf possesses
incredible agility,

44:01.138 --> 44:03.973
speed and those
keen animal instincts.

44:04.058 --> 44:06.225
He can take
a ton of abuse,

44:06.310 --> 44:09.312
and he'll be in turbo
moonshine mode tonight.

44:09.396 --> 44:12.649
We're basically looking
at a tremendous athlete,

44:12.691 --> 44:16.986
Weill-conditioned and
powerful, and Swamp Gut is
gonna have his hands full.

44:17.029 --> 44:19.072
(narrator)
Swamp Gut.

44:19.156 --> 44:23.034
[grunting]

44:32.086 --> 44:34.837
Next up is
the king of the bog,

44:34.922 --> 44:40.218
the disgusting
and repulsive marsh
demon known as Swamp Gut.

44:40.302 --> 44:45.098
This gelatinous creature
will be out of his element
for the first time tonight.

44:45.182 --> 44:49.936
Swamp Gut is a repugnant
pariah and odious glutton.

44:50.020 --> 44:55.525
He is morbidly obese
so he must use that size
and power to his advantage,

44:55.567 --> 44:59.570
to make up
for the obvious drawback
of his massive gut.

44:59.655 --> 45:05.243
He is also capable
of stirring up a bellyful
of toxic swamp trash,

45:05.327 --> 45:08.579
so Werewolf
will wanna avoid
close quarters

45:08.664 --> 45:11.290
or else risk
getting slimed.

45:11.375 --> 45:15.795
Now, over to Jimmy Hart
to summon these bastards
out of the crypts.

45:15.879 --> 45:19.048
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's time for the
heavyweight battle

45:19.091 --> 45:21.634
for the Monster Brawl
Creatures Conference.

45:21.719 --> 45:25.263
Introducing first,
weighing in at
225 pounds,

45:25.347 --> 45:27.306
the man in the moon,
the howler,

45:27.391 --> 45:30.643
the disemboweller,
Werewolf!

45:36.275 --> 45:38.818
[howls]

45:44.074 --> 45:47.410
And his opponent,
weighing in at
438 pounds,

45:47.494 --> 45:49.912
the uncontested
marshal of the marsh,

45:49.997 --> 45:54.584
Swamp Gut!

46:02.676 --> 46:05.178
[growling]

46:09.433 --> 46:12.852
And a quick look at our
tale of the tape for
this fight

46:12.936 --> 46:15.938
reveals an
interesting dichotomy.

46:16.023 --> 46:18.024
Swamp Gut is
obviously the older,

46:18.108 --> 46:20.777
bigger and more
experienced of
the two fighters,

46:20.861 --> 46:23.946
and Werewolf comes in
with a relatively
unknown record.

46:27.576 --> 46:29.577
The fight
is afoot, folks,

46:29.661 --> 46:32.789
with our Creature Conference
Heavyweight Championship.

46:32.873 --> 46:37.960
We'll soon find out
who will be representing
the realm of Creatures

46:38.003 --> 46:43.466
in the Monster
Brawl finale.

46:43.550 --> 46:47.553
Werewolf to the offensive
in the early-going, as he
uses a headlock like a vice

46:47.638 --> 46:50.014
and showers down
a torrent of face shots.

46:50.098 --> 46:54.560
And a reactionary elbow
from the man in moss.

46:54.645 --> 46:57.480
And Werewolf runs into
a solid brick wall

46:57.523 --> 47:00.024
as Swamp Gut easily
stands his ground

47:00.108 --> 47:04.570
using that insurmountable
gut gravity to stay on
his feet.

47:04.655 --> 47:06.280
(narrator)
Appalling.

47:06.365 --> 47:08.699
Swamp Gut with a
heavy frog splash,

47:08.784 --> 47:11.994
flattening Werewolf
into a pancake.

47:12.037 --> 47:15.373
He follows it up
with a ruthless
knee to the head.

47:15.457 --> 47:18.000
Werewolf has got
to be careful here.

47:18.085 --> 47:22.213
He can't afford to exchange
big maneuvers like that
or he'll never survive.

47:22.297 --> 47:25.383
Werewolf evades
the giant swamp
creature,

47:25.467 --> 47:28.594
trying to gain
some ground.

47:28.679 --> 47:30.680
Swamp Gut with a
heavy right hook,

47:30.764 --> 47:33.099
but Werewolf counters
with a great block.

47:33.183 --> 47:35.560
Perfect timing
by Werewolf.

47:37.604 --> 47:41.023
And Swamp Gut
hoarks up some
toxic marsh venom

47:41.066 --> 47:44.193
into the face of Werewolf,
sending him to the mat.

47:46.029 --> 47:48.239
And Werewolf trying
to throw some punches,

47:48.323 --> 47:52.785
but Swamp Gut
expertly defends that
big, fat belly of his.

47:52.870 --> 47:56.706
That's definitely his
weak spot, and now Werewolf
gets a jab into the face

47:56.790 --> 47:59.584
and the Gut
is now exposed
for an open assault!

47:59.668 --> 48:01.878
Werewolf goes to work
on the bread-basket,

48:01.962 --> 48:06.215
dealing several hard
jabs to Swamp Gut's
putrid paunch.

48:06.258 --> 48:10.261
I haven't seen an abdomen
attack like this since
King Hippo back in '88.

48:10.345 --> 48:14.640
Swamp Gut is hung up
in the ropes as Werewolf
comes running at him

48:14.725 --> 48:16.934
with a lethal
shoulder spear.

48:17.019 --> 48:19.312
And I don't believe it!
Swamp gut is down!

48:19.396 --> 48:23.566
He's gotta throw everything
at this fat son of a bitch!

48:23.609 --> 48:26.277
It's now or never!

48:26.361 --> 48:29.071
(narrator)
Sensational.

48:33.577 --> 48:38.497
And Werewolf pressing
the advantage now as he
delivers a kick to the face

48:38.582 --> 48:40.583
of the glutinous
Swamp Gut.

48:40.667 --> 48:43.002
His wolf-sense is at
an all-time high, Buzz.

48:43.086 --> 48:46.756
He needs to crush this
Gut once and for all!

48:48.759 --> 48:52.261
Werewolf with a thunderous
uppercut to Swamp Gut,

48:52.346 --> 48:55.431
and his bowels
are churning, Sid.

48:55.515 --> 48:58.684
He lets the air out
of Swamp Gut's spare tire,

48:58.769 --> 49:01.270
and this is going
to get messy, Buzz.

49:01.313 --> 49:03.940
Swamp Gut falls
to the canvas mat,

49:04.024 --> 49:06.859
and I don't think he's
ever gonna get up, Buzz.

49:06.944 --> 49:11.489
Swamp Gut having
serious indigestion
problems.

49:14.493 --> 49:16.869
Werewolf climbs up
to the top rope,

49:16.954 --> 49:21.832
and letting that animal
inside take over as he
howls into the night.

49:21.917 --> 49:24.627
[howling]

49:27.422 --> 49:30.383
And a sky-high lunar
assault from Werewolf

49:30.467 --> 49:33.636
explodes the belly
of Swamp Gut.

49:33.679 --> 49:36.639
We have just witnessed
the disgusting demise

49:36.723 --> 49:40.476
of a truly legendary
forest demon.

49:40.519 --> 49:42.186
(narrator)
Werewolf wins.

49:42.270 --> 49:45.731
Lunar Belly Buster.

49:45.816 --> 49:52.530
Hey, and the winner
is the Werewolf!

49:52.614 --> 49:55.574
Our first Heavyweight
match is in the books

49:55.659 --> 49:57.576
as Werewolf
is crowned

49:57.661 --> 50:01.038
with the Creatures
Conference Heavyweight
Title.

50:01.123 --> 50:04.667
He'll move on to our
championship match later
this evening

50:04.710 --> 50:09.338
to face the Heavyweight
winner from the Undead
Conference.

50:11.633 --> 50:14.760
(narrator)
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

50:22.686 --> 50:24.437
Colonel Crookshanks, Sir!

50:26.857 --> 50:29.025
As you were, Briggs.

50:29.109 --> 50:31.193
I just got word
from base, Sir.

50:31.236 --> 50:34.238
They've reported us AWOL.

50:34.322 --> 50:36.240
Don't worry about
it, Lieutenant.

50:37.909 --> 50:40.786
We stay the course,
just like we planned.

50:40.871 --> 50:43.456
It's a culmination
of what?

50:43.540 --> 50:45.916
Sacrifice!
Discipline!
Yes, honor!

50:47.461 --> 50:49.879
The dawn of a new
weapon is upon us.

50:49.963 --> 50:54.300
This monster tournament,
the perfect testing ground.

50:54.384 --> 50:57.053
Now, how about you
and I go take a look

50:57.137 --> 51:00.639
at this magnificent
son of a bitch?

51:00.724 --> 51:02.475
Yeah.

51:02.559 --> 51:05.061
This thing, a specimen
from the '69 outbreak?

51:05.103 --> 51:07.897
Affirmative.
The military's
worst kept secret.

51:07.939 --> 51:10.733
I've been training
this bastard for
ten years.

51:10.817 --> 51:14.904
You know, the government
wants to shut it down.

51:14.946 --> 51:17.448
They should have
a hard-on for this
kind of stuff.

51:17.532 --> 51:19.992
And the personnel?
What happened to them?

51:20.077 --> 51:22.745
Who ran this place
before you got on board?

51:22.829 --> 51:24.455
They were eaten.

51:26.458 --> 51:28.250
So, how's our
old friend doing?

51:28.335 --> 51:30.086
He's in a foul
mood, Sir.

51:30.170 --> 51:32.671
He's starving.
He's always starving.

51:32.756 --> 51:35.591
We're running
out of bodies
to feed this thing.

51:35.634 --> 51:38.844
Lieutenant,
why in the hell are
you always so negative?

51:38.929 --> 51:40.930
Colonel, we could
be shot for this.

51:41.014 --> 51:43.599
We're gonna get
medals for this.

51:49.940 --> 51:53.359
Morning, sunshine.

51:53.443 --> 51:58.364
Briggs, go ahead.
Unleash him.

51:58.448 --> 52:02.118
Let's get an idea of what
kind of conditioning
we've got going.

52:02.160 --> 52:03.786
You're kidding me?

52:03.829 --> 52:05.704
You think
I'm kidding?

52:08.500 --> 52:12.044
Go in there
and let him loose,

52:12.129 --> 52:16.257
or I'm gonna stick one
between your eyes.

52:18.343 --> 52:21.679
I never signed up
for this, Colonel.

52:23.598 --> 52:26.684
The ultimate
killing machine.
The ultimate soldier.

52:26.768 --> 52:28.644
Bent on death
and destruction.

52:28.728 --> 52:33.023
Briggs, this is
our finest hour,
I swear to you.

52:36.444 --> 52:38.737
Colonel, shoot him!

52:38.822 --> 52:40.823
Shoot him!

52:46.371 --> 52:48.330
Zombie Man.

52:48.373 --> 52:51.000
Eat slow, my friend.

52:51.042 --> 52:54.128
Briggs was a good man.

53:01.178 --> 53:04.430
(narrator)
Ingolstadt, Germany.

53:08.727 --> 53:12.188
(Dr. Igor)
From the journal
of Dr. Ivo Igora.

53:12.272 --> 53:15.524
November 5th.
To examine the
causes of life,

53:15.567 --> 53:18.527
we must first
have recourse
to death.

53:18.612 --> 53:22.364
I have become
well-acquainted with
the science of anatomy.

53:22.407 --> 53:25.075
I have also observed
the natural decay
and corruption

53:25.160 --> 53:27.453
of the human body.

53:27.537 --> 53:32.208
In a solitary chamber,
I kept my workshop of
filthy creation,

53:32.250 --> 53:37.046
while I brought
my work near to
a conclusion.

53:37.088 --> 53:41.050
And the moon gazed
on my midnight labors

53:41.092 --> 53:45.471
while I pursued nature
to her hiding places.

53:47.557 --> 53:51.101
Who shall conceive
the horrors of my
secret toil

53:51.186 --> 53:56.190
as I dabbled
among the unhallowed
damps of the grave?

54:01.571 --> 54:03.447
Remember.

54:03.531 --> 54:08.410
I am not recording
the vision of a madman.

54:08.495 --> 54:12.790
After days and nights
of incredible labor
and fatigue,

54:12.874 --> 54:15.668
I succeeded
in discovering
the cause

54:15.752 --> 54:18.003
of generation
and life.

54:18.088 --> 54:20.631
Nay, more.

54:20.715 --> 54:25.469
I became
myself capable
of bestowing animation

54:25.553 --> 54:27.513
upon lifeless matter.

55:01.047 --> 55:04.174
[deep breathing]

55:15.895 --> 55:17.271
[grunts]

55:22.402 --> 55:24.820
Father.

55:36.207 --> 55:39.084
(narrator)
Undead Conference
Heavyweight Title Match.

55:39.169 --> 55:42.004
Frankenstein
vs. Zombie Man.

55:42.047 --> 55:45.090
We're back, folks,
and ready for our
next match-up

55:45.175 --> 55:48.344
which is a ghastly
showdown of undead
forces.

55:48.386 --> 55:53.265
Our next fight features
the seemingly immortal
corpse Frankenstein

55:53.350 --> 55:56.685
versus the cannibalistic
revenant known as
Zombie Man.

55:56.770 --> 56:02.358
The winner of this fight will
proceed to the championship
main event against Werewolf.

56:02.442 --> 56:07.029
Now, time to unearth
some more dirt on these
two brain-dead savages.

56:07.113 --> 56:09.198
(narrator)
Frankenstein.

56:09.240 --> 56:13.869
Like one who
on a lonely road,

56:13.912 --> 56:17.873
doth walk
in fear and dread.

56:17.916 --> 56:21.710
And having once
turned round walks on,

56:21.795 --> 56:25.089
and turns
no more his head.

56:25.173 --> 56:29.593
Because he knows
a frightful fiend

56:29.677 --> 56:33.389
doth close
behind him tread.

56:33.473 --> 56:36.266
Frankenstein!

56:37.685 --> 56:39.269
Father!

56:39.354 --> 56:41.730
Frankenstein has
been reanimated

56:41.773 --> 56:44.983
and deactivated several
times throughout his
lengthy career.

56:45.068 --> 56:48.070
He's waved goodbye to
the European fight scene,

56:48.113 --> 56:52.908
and has brought his "A"
game to North America
for the first time.

56:52.992 --> 56:56.662
He's basically
a bruising and
brawling sort of fighter

56:56.746 --> 57:01.750
who relies heavily
on 1 9th century ogre
battle systems.

57:01.835 --> 57:05.629
Frankenstein
can wield immense
power and strength,

57:05.713 --> 57:08.507
and is essentially
a zombie himself,

57:08.591 --> 57:13.679
albeit a bigger one
and not blinded by
a desire for flesh.

57:13.763 --> 57:17.266
And watch for his manager,
the ubiquitous Dr. Igora

57:17.308 --> 57:19.935
to play a major role
in the proceedings.

57:19.978 --> 57:22.104
(narrator)
Zombie Man.

57:22.188 --> 57:24.731
Frankenstein, you
stitched-up bastard!

57:24.774 --> 57:26.525
I gotta
question for you!

57:26.609 --> 57:29.695
I got the ultimate
killing machine,
Zombie Man!

57:29.779 --> 57:34.116
What are you gonna do
when he defeats you,

57:34.200 --> 57:35.284
then

57:36.494 --> 57:38.454
eats you?

57:38.496 --> 57:42.207
Zombie Man is a
well-trained grappler
type of combatant,

57:42.292 --> 57:44.626
relying on an
arsenal of punches,

57:44.669 --> 57:46.378
grabs, holds
and bites.

57:46.463 --> 57:48.839
This guy can take
a lot of damage.

57:48.923 --> 57:53.010
He is managed
by the rogue soldier
Colonel Crookshanks,

57:53.094 --> 57:56.013
who has transformed
this cannibalistic
ghoul

57:56.097 --> 57:58.724
into a one-man army.

57:58.808 --> 58:03.479
Colonel Crookshanks
has done a fabulous job
of training Zombie Man

58:03.563 --> 58:07.399
and my understanding
is that if Zombie Man
wins the Brawl,

58:07.484 --> 58:12.154
we'll have a new type
of soldier for future
wars around the world.

58:12.197 --> 58:16.200
If he loses,
just another corpse
added to the heap.

58:16.284 --> 58:19.244
Add to this
an insatiable
hunger for flesh,

58:19.329 --> 58:22.372
and you have
yourself one hell
of a killing machine.

58:22.457 --> 58:24.917
Battling
for the Undead
Conference title,

58:25.001 --> 58:26.835
two horrendous
champions of the grave!

58:26.920 --> 58:29.254
First up, fighting
out of the stone crypt,

58:29.339 --> 58:32.883
is the undisputed
grandmaster of
Gothic giants.

58:32.967 --> 58:35.260
The reigning champion
of reanimation

58:35.345 --> 58:37.095
and eternal damnation.

58:37.180 --> 58:39.723
The undefeated
legend of the fall,

58:39.807 --> 58:43.268
Frankenstein!

58:48.900 --> 58:53.237
And, Buzz, technically
it's Frankenstein's monster,

58:53.321 --> 58:55.739
if you want to be
a dick about it.

59:02.539 --> 59:06.208
[growls]

59:10.129 --> 59:12.548
And now making his
way out to the ring,

59:12.632 --> 59:14.925
hailing
from Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania,

59:15.009 --> 59:18.387
a blood-drunk, belligerent,
brain-eating bastard.

59:18.429 --> 59:21.390
The deathless,
non-perishable,
ever-lasting,

59:21.432 --> 59:28.063
invincible
and undying
Zombie Man!

59:48.585 --> 59:51.920
And a quick glance
to see how our
monsters align,

59:51.963 --> 59:54.631
illustrates a grim
contrast here

59:54.716 --> 59:58.802
as Frankenstein
takes the cake in
mostly all categories.

59:58.886 --> 01:00:01.471
Zombie Man is no
slouch himself,

01:00:01.556 --> 01:00:07.269
and he reminds me
of a younger, healthier
Sasquatch Sid Tucker.

01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:12.190
Both fighters getting
ready inside the ring,

01:00:12.275 --> 01:00:16.778
and you can just feel
the tension rising here
at the Necropolis tonight.

01:00:16.821 --> 01:00:19.948
[ding]

01:00:19.991 --> 01:00:23.827
Frankenstein and Zombie
collide in the middle
of the ring.

01:00:23.911 --> 01:00:28.165
The big man corrals Zombie
into the corner and goes
to work right away.

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:33.629
Frankenstein executes
a superb clothesline,

01:00:33.713 --> 01:00:37.382
sending the godforsaken
Zombie to the canvas mat.

01:00:37.467 --> 01:00:39.051
Incredible move, Buzz.

01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:40.802
I concur, Sidney.

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:50.312
(narrator)
Exceptional.

01:00:50.396 --> 01:00:53.815
And Zombie Man
in serious danger
now, Buzz.

01:00:53.858 --> 01:00:56.735
This fight
could be over.

01:00:56.819 --> 01:01:00.822
And keep in mind
these fighters have already
died once in their lifetime,

01:01:00.865 --> 01:01:04.576
but this time,
there will be
no reanimation.

01:01:04.661 --> 01:01:06.828
All the chips
are on the table.

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:11.375
And what a
tolerance for pain.

01:01:11.459 --> 01:01:14.002
Folks, he just
won't stay down.

01:01:14.087 --> 01:01:16.588
Zombie Man is
incredibly resilient.

01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:19.257
Frankenstein,
better try a
new strategy.

01:01:19.342 --> 01:01:22.177
And Frankenstein
manager Doc Igora

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:25.347
is getting a little
impatient with
his monster.

01:01:25.431 --> 01:01:27.683
Crush his head,
you imbecile.

01:01:27.725 --> 01:01:29.601
His head!

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:32.396
Well, he's right, Buzz.
You can't stop the Zombie

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:35.357
without dealing it
some massive trauma
to the head.

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:40.028
Frankenstein
puts Zombie into
a powerful stranglehold.

01:01:40.071 --> 01:01:42.447
Come on!

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:44.866
Zombie Man with
a double ear-slap

01:01:44.951 --> 01:01:47.869
sends Frankenstein
reeling to the center
of the ring.

01:01:47.954 --> 01:01:51.206
A timely
counterattack
by the Zombie

01:01:51.249 --> 01:01:53.208
as he finds
new life.

01:01:53.251 --> 01:01:57.546
And Zombie Man bites
the arm of Frankenstein,

01:01:57.588 --> 01:01:59.798
gnawing some of
that rotten flesh.

01:01:59.882 --> 01:02:02.968
And no concern that
Frankenstein will turn
into a zombie.

01:02:03.052 --> 01:02:05.303
He's already
technically
dead, people.

01:02:05.388 --> 01:02:08.140
Get up!
Come on, get up!

01:02:08.224 --> 01:02:12.602
And Zombie Man doing his
best to try and knock down
the all-powerful Frankenstein.

01:02:12.687 --> 01:02:15.939
His only path
to victory is
toppling the giant

01:02:16.023 --> 01:02:18.150
and getting
him off his feet.

01:02:18.234 --> 01:02:20.360
(narrator)
Medic.

01:02:20.445 --> 01:02:23.572
And nothing
seems to move this
over-sized corpse, Sid,

01:02:23.614 --> 01:02:27.993
as Zombie Man throws
everything but the kitchen
sink at Frankenstein.

01:02:32.039 --> 01:02:37.627
And Zombie Man unleashes
a barrage of blows to the
mid-section of the big man.

01:02:42.675 --> 01:02:46.011
And spank me
cross-eyed, Sid.

01:02:46.095 --> 01:02:50.599
Doctor Igora enters the
ring and he hits Zombie Man
in the back of the head

01:02:50.641 --> 01:02:55.437
with a pipe wrench,
sending the blood-thirsty
bastard to the ground.

01:02:55.521 --> 01:02:57.647
And the Colonel
is hopping mad, Buzz.

01:02:57.732 --> 01:03:02.819
That was an unfair
foreign object by the
weasel manager Doc Igora.

01:03:02.904 --> 01:03:05.197
And wait
a minute, folks!

01:03:05.281 --> 01:03:08.867
Colonel Crookshanks with
a hatchet to the back
of the Doctor,

01:03:08.951 --> 01:03:13.288
and he goes down
at the side of the ring.

01:03:19.504 --> 01:03:22.297
Buzz, that
was a mistake
by the Colonel.

01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:26.134
He's triggered
a force more powerful
than he can imagine.

01:03:26.219 --> 01:03:28.845
Look at the rage in
Frankenstein's face.

01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:32.057
And he's friggin'
pissed, folks!

01:03:32.141 --> 01:03:35.894
Frankenstein
systematically
destroys Zombie Man

01:03:35.978 --> 01:03:38.063
with a deluge
of blows.

01:03:38.147 --> 01:03:39.731
(narrator)
Tremendous.

01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:41.983
Who is this
indestructible Zombie?

01:03:42.068 --> 01:03:45.654
I've never seen
someone withstand
such an ass-kicking!

01:03:45.738 --> 01:03:47.739
Zombie Man
knocked out
of the ring.

01:03:47.824 --> 01:03:50.200
Now we're in for
some graveyard action!

01:03:55.039 --> 01:03:57.541
Frankenstein with
a choke-hold move,

01:03:57.625 --> 01:04:02.087
lifting Zombie Man off
his feet and slamming him
hard to the ground.

01:04:02.171 --> 01:04:04.089
What a crippling
move, Buzz.

01:04:04.173 --> 01:04:05.674
[growls]

01:04:07.134 --> 01:04:09.052
And cover
your eyes, Sid!

01:04:09.136 --> 01:04:12.347
Frankenstein
has squashed
Zombie Man's head

01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:14.516
with a brutal
foot stomp.

01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:16.351
Zombie Man is done!

01:04:18.229 --> 01:04:20.438
(narrator)
Frankenstein wins.

01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:23.191
Brain-crushing
foot stomp.

01:04:23.276 --> 01:04:25.360
You know
that was an
unbelievable match.

01:04:25.403 --> 01:04:27.195
Frankenstein
has done it again!

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:33.285
Hey, and the winner
of the match is
Frankenstein!

01:04:33.369 --> 01:04:36.204
And there appears
to be some commotion

01:04:36.247 --> 01:04:39.291
going on at the back
of the graveyard, Sid.

01:04:39.375 --> 01:04:42.252
There's trouble
a brewing near
the old hill, Buzz.

01:04:42.336 --> 01:04:45.297
(Cyril)
I told you to mind
your own business.

01:04:45.381 --> 01:04:50.302
The soil is cursed, boy.
Something evil has
been unearthed.

01:04:50.386 --> 01:04:53.054
You're all doomed.

01:04:53.097 --> 01:04:56.474
For the Love of God.
The dead are rising
from their graves,

01:04:56.559 --> 01:05:00.478
answering the call
of distress from Zombie
Man's untimely death.

01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:03.899
Unbelievable,
ladies and gentlemen!

01:05:03.983 --> 01:05:07.736
In death, Zombie Man
has summoned an army
of undead

01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:11.573
united against
Frankenstein.

01:05:11.657 --> 01:05:14.951
Holy crap, Buzz!
This is insanity!

01:05:17.705 --> 01:05:20.624
Wait a minute, girls,
here comes the zombies!
Every man for himself.

01:05:20.708 --> 01:05:23.793
Run!

01:05:23.878 --> 01:05:29.090
For the first time
in the history of
professional sports, folks,

01:05:29.133 --> 01:05:33.094
we are witnessing
the living dead rising
from their graves

01:05:33.179 --> 01:05:35.805
to confront
Frankenstein.

01:05:35.890 --> 01:05:39.351
Now, we've seen
tag-teams before, Buzz.

01:05:39.435 --> 01:05:43.063
But six on one
is unheard of.

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:49.402
[growling]

01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:53.949
And Frankenstein
escapes the graveyard,

01:05:54.033 --> 01:05:56.785
and runs for cover
into the crypt.

01:05:56.869 --> 01:05:59.287
No sense for him
to stick around, Sid.

01:05:59.330 --> 01:06:02.123
He's got another
fight ahead of him.

01:06:13.928 --> 01:06:16.304
[shouts]

01:06:16.347 --> 01:06:19.849
And now the Colonel
goes down at the side
of the ring.

01:06:19.934 --> 01:06:21.893
These zombies
are out of control.

01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:23.979
And we may be
next, Sidney.

01:06:24.063 --> 01:06:26.147
Don't worry
about it, Buzz.
I'm packing!

01:06:26.190 --> 01:06:28.566
I'll take
care of you.

01:06:28.651 --> 01:06:30.485
Sweet potato fries!

01:06:30.569 --> 01:06:32.612
[shouting]

01:06:55.261 --> 01:06:56.720
Good work there, Sid.

01:07:00.516 --> 01:07:02.392
That doesn't look
very good, Sidney.

01:07:02.476 --> 01:07:04.769
Just a scratch, Buzz.

01:07:04.854 --> 01:07:06.521
Just a scratch.

01:07:06.605 --> 01:07:08.314
Doesn't look so good.

01:07:18.159 --> 01:07:21.202
[groaning]

01:07:35.176 --> 01:07:37.093
[shouting]
Why?

01:07:50.316 --> 01:07:54.277
And we're back on the air
in the announcer's booth,

01:07:54.361 --> 01:07:58.073
and I regret
to inform you
that Sasquatch Sid

01:07:58.157 --> 01:08:02.327
has sustained
a minor injury
to his hands, folks.

01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:04.954
That's correct.
I had a tussle
with a zombie

01:08:05.039 --> 01:08:07.415
and suffered
a small bite wound.

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:10.835
But I put a little
alcohol on it and
I feel fine.

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.587
Really I do.

01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:14.672
Now, let's get
back to the fights.

01:08:14.757 --> 01:08:18.176
Yes, and we'll keep
an eye on Sid as
the evening advances.

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:22.138
(narrator)
Monster Brawl Heavyweight
Championship Match.

01:08:22.223 --> 01:08:25.183
Frankenstein
vs. Werewolf.

01:08:25.267 --> 01:08:29.312
So, what makes me
think I have a chance
in Hell

01:08:29.395 --> 01:08:32.107
of beating
Frankenstein?

01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:34.984
One word: vengeance.

01:08:35.069 --> 01:08:36.944
It is true

01:08:37.029 --> 01:08:40.782
that I am a wretch.

01:08:40.825 --> 01:08:44.702
I have murdered
the lovely and
the helpless.

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:47.872
It was a monster
that took my wife.

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:51.126
It was a monster
that took my child.

01:08:51.210 --> 01:08:54.045
It was a monster
that took my life away,

01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:57.966
so I guess
you could say I don't
like monsters very much!

01:08:59.176 --> 01:09:00.718
I have strangled

01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:03.638
the innocent
as they slept.

01:09:03.721 --> 01:09:05.974
I don't care
if they're zombies,

01:09:06.015 --> 01:09:08.475
I don't care
if they're vampires.

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:10.395
Hell, you saw what
I did to Swamp Gut!

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:12.272
My reign

01:09:13.439 --> 01:09:15.817
is not yet over.

01:09:15.859 --> 01:09:18.819
So, Frankenstein,
you can come at me
with your big, dumb,

01:09:18.904 --> 01:09:23.158
stitched-up face and
your "roar-roar-roar
Father."

01:09:23.242 --> 01:09:24.993
And it ain't gonna
do a damn thing.

01:09:25.077 --> 01:09:27.203
Come on,

01:09:27.287 --> 01:09:28.705
my enemy.

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:33.209
We have yet
to wrestle
for our lives.

01:09:33.294 --> 01:09:36.880
[howling]

01:09:36.964 --> 01:09:39.048
[growling]

01:09:40.759 --> 01:09:44.386
So, after
four explosive
and gory fights,

01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:47.348
we've reached
the moment we've
all been waiting for.

01:09:47.433 --> 01:09:52.854
The final main event
featuring Frankenstein
from the Undead realm

01:09:52.938 --> 01:09:55.356
pitted against
Werewolf,

01:09:55.441 --> 01:09:58.443
the torchbearer
of all evil creatures.

01:09:58.527 --> 01:10:00.737
That's right, Buzz.

01:10:00.821 --> 01:10:03.907
Bookies in Vegas
were paying 200
to 1 odds

01:10:03.991 --> 01:10:07.285
on Werewolf
from the outset.

01:10:07.369 --> 01:10:09.913
To see him
[coughs]

01:10:09.997 --> 01:10:11.873
claw his way
into the finals

01:10:11.916 --> 01:10:14.584
is nothing short
of miraculous.

01:10:14.668 --> 01:10:16.628
As for
Frankenstein he is

01:10:16.712 --> 01:10:19.088
[coughs]
after all,

01:10:19.173 --> 01:10:22.258
the most legendary
monster of all time,

01:10:22.343 --> 01:10:24.761
so no surprise
that he would

01:10:26.388 --> 01:10:29.891
capture the flag
for the Undead world.

01:10:29.934 --> 01:10:34.729
And now Let's turn
the reins over to the Lord
of the ring, Jimmy Hart!

01:10:34.813 --> 01:10:38.983
The time has come
for our main event
of the evening.

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:43.238
The supreme and
undisputed heavyweight
monster championship

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:47.116
is at stake tonight.
Ladies and gentlemen,
friends and fiends,

01:10:47.201 --> 01:10:51.454
introducing first
the undefeated king
of the Undead Conference.

01:10:51.538 --> 01:10:53.248
The eternal
green giant.

01:10:53.290 --> 01:10:56.251
The electrifying,
the death-defying,

01:10:56.335 --> 01:10:58.836
the indestructible demon

01:10:58.921 --> 01:11:04.342
Frankenstein!

01:11:17.648 --> 01:11:20.441
Strap yourself
into the electric
chair, people.

01:11:20.526 --> 01:11:24.779
This is gonna
get crazy here at
the Hillside Necropolis

01:11:24.822 --> 01:11:29.284
as Frankenstein faces
down the Werewolf

01:11:29.368 --> 01:11:33.997
in a legendary showdown
for monster supremacy.

01:11:34.081 --> 01:11:37.542
And the stats
are just staggering

01:11:37.626 --> 01:11:40.628
for Frankenstein, Buzz.

01:11:40.671 --> 01:11:44.048
Over 450 pounds.

01:11:44.133 --> 01:11:48.469
Biceps are 30 inches.
Thighs 40 inches.

01:11:48.554 --> 01:11:54.559
Have you ever seen a bigger
combatant in the history
of professional sports?

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:03.526
[grunting]

01:12:03.610 --> 01:12:06.154
And his opponent,
fighting out of
the wood crypt,

01:12:06.196 --> 01:12:09.657
the crusader
of all evil creatures
from across the globe.

01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:12.910
The beast of sacred
lore, Canus Lupus,

01:12:12.995 --> 01:12:16.664
the lunar
death-dealer
Werewolf!

01:12:16.707 --> 01:12:19.834
[grunting]

01:12:32.514 --> 01:12:35.099
[distant howling]

01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:51.032
And look at the menacing
way both monsters are
staring at each other.

01:12:51.075 --> 01:12:54.869
The Werewolf beaming
with unbridled rage

01:12:54.912 --> 01:12:57.455
as he sizes up
the big man.

01:13:21.313 --> 01:13:24.232
And Werewolf makes
the first move as he
whips off the rope

01:13:24.316 --> 01:13:28.361
for a take-down,
but Frankenstein
doesn't even flinch, Sid.

01:13:30.614 --> 01:13:33.741
And now he tries
to land a few blows,

01:13:33.784 --> 01:13:38.079
but Frankenstein
is virtually immune
to this stuff.

01:13:38.122 --> 01:13:40.456
It's child's play
to him, Buzz.

01:13:40.541 --> 01:13:43.167
And now
Frankenstein retaliates

01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:45.920
and throws the Werewolf
into the corner.

01:13:45.963 --> 01:13:48.005
(narrator)
Magnificent.

01:13:51.802 --> 01:13:54.095
[grunting]

01:13:55.764 --> 01:13:58.599
[groaning]

01:14:05.107 --> 01:14:08.776
And somebody better
call the Humane Society.

01:14:08.861 --> 01:14:14.365
Because we're witnessing
extreme animal abuse
here tonight.

01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:19.996
Couple of big blows
from Frankenstein

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:22.707
and he is
pummeling Werewolf.

01:14:22.791 --> 01:14:27.837
And a big slam by Frankenstein
sends the Werewolf crashing
to the canvas mat.

01:14:27.921 --> 01:14:31.799
Look out!
Frankenstein comes
down hard on Werewolf.

01:14:31.842 --> 01:14:33.468
[growling]

01:14:33.552 --> 01:14:35.636
[coughing]

01:14:50.194 --> 01:14:52.361
[growling]

01:14:57.117 --> 01:15:00.077
Werewolf has done
the impossible, folks.

01:15:00.162 --> 01:15:03.247
Frankenstein
is down and out.

01:15:06.001 --> 01:15:07.752
(narrator)
Spectacular.

01:15:07.836 --> 01:15:10.546
[howling]

01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:18.095
Werewolf performs
a doomsday figure
four leg lock.

01:15:35.656 --> 01:15:39.450
And now Frankenstein
breaks free from the hold.

01:15:46.333 --> 01:15:49.377
[groaning]

01:16:09.523 --> 01:16:10.731
[coughing]

01:16:14.778 --> 01:16:19.156
And now he gets in a couple of
mammoth hooks to the cobbled
frame of Frankenstein

01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:22.410
and lands a heavy
punch to the face.

01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:26.455
Now he's using
his brains, Buzz.

01:16:29.459 --> 01:16:31.252
That's right, Sid.

01:16:31.336 --> 01:16:35.631
Smart defensive prowess
on behalf of the Werewolf.

01:16:35.716 --> 01:16:39.802
And now the Werewolf
attempting a bodyslam
of Frankenstein.

01:16:39.886 --> 01:16:42.013
And this is
a gamble folks.

01:16:42.097 --> 01:16:45.266
Oh, no!
Frankenstein is
just too heavy,

01:16:45.309 --> 01:16:48.185
and now the Werewolf
is paying the price

01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:52.481
as nearly a half
a cubic ton comes
crashing on top of him.

01:16:53.942 --> 01:16:58.279
I'm getting awfully
hungry, Buzz.

01:16:58.322 --> 01:17:01.490
Okay, Sid.
We'll be going to the
rippers after the show

01:17:01.575 --> 01:17:02.825
just like we planned.

01:17:11.001 --> 01:17:13.252
[growling]

01:17:24.348 --> 01:17:27.475
Frankenstein using
those gigantic hands
like a python

01:17:27.559 --> 01:17:29.977
squeezing its prey.

01:17:30.062 --> 01:17:34.482
And we can literally hear
the bones of the Werewolf
being pulverized

01:17:34.566 --> 01:17:36.651
under that
heavy pressure.

01:17:36.735 --> 01:17:39.236
(narrator)
Discombobulating.

01:17:41.323 --> 01:17:43.699
The Werewolf is
out cold, folks.

01:17:43.784 --> 01:17:45.159
He is dead!

01:17:45.202 --> 01:17:47.995
[growling]

01:17:51.166 --> 01:17:56.212
Frankenstein is
now the Monster Brawl
Heavyweight Champion.

01:17:56.296 --> 01:17:58.005
Can you
believe it, Sid?

01:17:58.048 --> 01:18:00.591
Can you
believe it, Sid?

01:18:00.676 --> 01:18:02.301
Sid?

01:18:04.179 --> 01:18:07.348
Sasquatch Sid has
gone silent, folks.

01:18:07.432 --> 01:18:09.183
[growling]

01:18:12.604 --> 01:18:15.022
[gunshot]

01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:20.277
Welcome back, folks.
I'm Buzz Chambers,

01:18:20.362 --> 01:18:23.698
and we are back
on the air again
here at Monster Brawl.

01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:28.536
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is with a heavy heart
that I must inform you

01:18:28.578 --> 01:18:32.373
that former champion
Sasquatch Sid

01:18:32.457 --> 01:18:36.544
has been destroyed
like a mongrel dog.

01:18:36.628 --> 01:18:40.881
He is survived
by his 13 kids,
5 ex-wives.

01:18:40.924 --> 01:18:43.759
He was 58 years old.

01:18:43.844 --> 01:18:46.053
And now, back
to the action.

01:18:46.138 --> 01:18:48.889
[growling]

01:18:53.979 --> 01:18:55.938
[clap of thunder]

01:18:56.022 --> 01:18:58.274
[yelling]

01:18:58.358 --> 01:19:01.152
Girls, there's
a storm coming.
This doesn't look good.

01:19:01.236 --> 01:19:03.738
We gotta get to higher
ground. Come on, Let's
get out of here.

01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:06.490
Come on,
get out of here.
Quick, quick!

01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:10.244
And ladies and gentlemen,
we have a storm brewing
in the distance,

01:19:10.328 --> 01:19:16.083
as Central Michigan is
under a severe electrical
storm alert.

01:19:16.126 --> 01:19:20.588
And things are getting
sinister here at the
Hillside Necropolis.

01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:23.382
[thundering]

01:19:32.851 --> 01:19:34.769
[growling]

01:19:37.230 --> 01:19:42.109
Frankenstein parading
around the ring with
the championship belt.

01:19:42.152 --> 01:19:44.779
[thundering]

01:19:50.118 --> 01:19:52.077
[grunts]

01:19:56.416 --> 01:19:59.168
[clap of thunder]

01:20:13.475 --> 01:20:15.976
But wait
a moment, folks.

01:20:16.019 --> 01:20:19.063
Wait a moment.
Werewolf is getting up.

01:20:20.899 --> 01:20:24.235
The Werewolf refuses
to be put to sleep

01:20:24.319 --> 01:20:27.696
as he miraculously
stands up now

01:20:27.781 --> 01:20:29.824
and hits
Frankenstein
in the back

01:20:29.908 --> 01:20:33.160
catching the big
man off guard.

01:20:33.245 --> 01:20:36.205
And Werewolf
to the offensive now,

01:20:36.289 --> 01:20:39.041
dealing Frankenstein
a series of mortal blows.

01:20:39.125 --> 01:20:40.709
[thundering]

01:20:44.005 --> 01:20:46.257
Frankenstein
smokes Werewolf

01:20:46.341 --> 01:20:51.178
with a gargantuan
uppercut, sending him
flying to the ground.

01:21:17.414 --> 01:21:21.959
And Frankenstein removes
one of those heavy stone
columns from the crypt,

01:21:22.043 --> 01:21:25.629
and swings it
like a baseball bat.

01:21:25.714 --> 01:21:27.631
One blow from
that column, folks,

01:21:27.716 --> 01:21:29.967
and this fight
would be over.

01:21:40.812 --> 01:21:44.106
Werewolf with a quick
dodge and he runs in
with a kick,

01:21:44.190 --> 01:21:48.736
knocking the column
away from Frankenstein.

01:21:50.447 --> 01:21:53.574
And the Werewolf
is in full control.

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:02.416
Werewolf picks up
a tombstone

01:22:02.459 --> 01:22:05.294
and smashes it
over Frankenstein,

01:22:05.378 --> 01:22:08.464
who crumples
to the ground.

01:22:08.548 --> 01:22:10.424
And now he grabs
another one

01:22:10.467 --> 01:22:14.011
and delivers a second
unforgiving blow.

01:22:22.437 --> 01:22:26.357
And a third one!
Frankenstein is
done for, folks,

01:22:26.441 --> 01:22:31.153
as the Werewolf gets
in three unanswered
tombstone blasts.

01:22:32.948 --> 01:22:36.283
And Frankenstein
is down for the count.

01:22:36.368 --> 01:22:38.619
[gargling]

01:22:38.662 --> 01:22:40.204
Ah!

01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:46.961
We could be looking
at the first ever
Monster Brawl champion.

01:22:47.045 --> 01:22:48.796
[howling]

01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:52.549
Werewolf howling
to the moon.

01:22:52.634 --> 01:22:55.219
But wait.
Frankenstein

01:22:55.303 --> 01:22:57.805
somehow rises up
once more

01:22:57.847 --> 01:23:01.642
and the Werewolf
is oblivious.

01:23:03.395 --> 01:23:06.063
Frankenstein
takes Werewolf down,

01:23:06.147 --> 01:23:09.358
and they resume
their graveyard tussle.

01:23:34.092 --> 01:23:36.510
[shouting]

01:23:44.686 --> 01:23:46.937
And he's prying
at his head, folks.

01:23:47.022 --> 01:23:50.399
He is prying at
his--Oh, my lord!

01:23:50.483 --> 01:23:56.071
Frankenstein rips
the head right off
the stunned creature

01:23:56.156 --> 01:23:58.907
and the Werewolf
is no more.

01:23:58.992 --> 01:24:01.035
(narrator)
Frankenstein wins.

01:24:01.077 --> 01:24:03.120
Head splitter.

01:24:03.204 --> 01:24:06.040
(Buzz)
Frankenstein with a
death-dealing finisher.

01:24:06.082 --> 01:24:09.960
And ladies and gentlemen,
Frankenstein has won
the Brawl.

01:24:10.045 --> 01:24:12.129
We have a
new champion!

01:24:12.213 --> 01:24:15.049
Frankenstein
emerges victorious

01:24:15.133 --> 01:24:17.217
after a bruising battle

01:24:17.302 --> 01:24:21.472
with the surprisingly
resilient Werewolf.

01:24:25.518 --> 01:24:28.520
[thundering]

01:24:39.824 --> 01:24:42.993
[grunting]

01:24:43.078 --> 01:24:44.703
But wait a minute.

01:24:44.788 --> 01:24:47.331
Something is going on
over by the wood crypt.

01:24:47.415 --> 01:24:52.878
Perhaps a secret
fighter to challenge
Frankenstein's reign.

01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:57.674
And the Colonel

01:24:57.759 --> 01:25:00.511
is making a
comeback, folks.

01:25:00.595 --> 01:25:03.138
I don't believe it.

01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:06.934
Frankenstein!

01:25:09.020 --> 01:25:14.149
Colonel Crookshanks
is back from beyond
the grave

01:25:14.234 --> 01:25:17.820
to confront his
mortal nemesis
Frankenstein

01:25:17.904 --> 01:25:21.782
in a clash
for the ages.

01:25:21.825 --> 01:25:25.035
Oh, don't nail that
coffin closed, yet, folks.

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:29.331
We have another brawl
going down here at
the cemetery.

01:25:34.712 --> 01:25:37.256
He throws
the Monster Brawl
belt to the ground

01:25:37.298 --> 01:25:39.383
and steps on it,

01:25:39.467 --> 01:25:43.971
in an act of complete
disrespect towards
the champ.

01:25:44.013 --> 01:25:48.851
[growling]

01:25:48.935 --> 01:25:51.019
Don't turn
that channel, folks.

01:25:51.104 --> 01:25:54.481
This is going
to get nasty!

01:26:10.874 --> 01:26:14.418
[Monster Truck sings
Righteous Smoke]

01:28:48.990 --> 01:28:52.743
Of course I'm excited.
I feel like an elephant
is sitting on my tongue.

01:28:52.827 --> 01:28:56.747
Let me tell you this right now.
I've been in Madison Square
Garden, sold-out crowd.

01:28:56.831 --> 01:28:59.499
I've been all over
the world, main event.
Hall of Fame ring.

01:28:59.542 --> 01:29:03.003
But this is the most
excitement I've had
in so long. Of course!

01:29:03.046 --> 01:29:06.673
Oh, my favorite monsters?
We had Frankenstein there,
Cyclops was there,

01:29:06.758 --> 01:29:08.216
Witch Bitch was--

01:29:08.301 --> 01:29:10.927
[Laughing]

01:29:11.012 --> 01:29:13.722
Zombies?
Oh, please,
give me a break.

01:29:13.806 --> 01:29:15.932
I can't
stand zombies.
Let me--huh?

01:29:16.017 --> 01:29:18.518
You know what?
I was telling my
friend on the phone

01:29:18.561 --> 01:29:20.354
that you're
awesome zombie--

01:29:22.065 --> 01:29:26.026
Please call 911 !
