<i>BARRY: My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

00:06.640 --> 00:08.847
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

00:09.040 --> 00:11.691
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

00:11.880 --> 00:14.451
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

00:15.480 --> 00:17.528
<i>After defeating Zoom
and saving the multi-verse,</i>

00:17.720 --> 00:21.281
<i>I ran back in time and created
the alternate timeline, Flashpoint.</i>

00:21.480 --> 00:23.050
<i>I restored the timeline to how it was</i>

00:23.240 --> 00:24.969
<i>only to find things
weren't as I left them.</i>

00:25.160 --> 00:27.128
<i>I brought new threats to our world.</i>

00:27.320 --> 00:29.971
<i>And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.</i>

00:30.160 --> 00:31.969
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

00:32.720 --> 00:33.767
CISCO: Previously on The Flash...

00:33.960 --> 00:34.927
What is that?

00:35.120 --> 00:37.691
Another epidermal husk.
A fully intact human pelt.

00:37.880 --> 00:40.042
Do we have any theories
as to what's causing them?

00:40.240 --> 00:41.287
I am Alchemy.

00:41.520 --> 00:42.442
Well, what do you want?

00:42.680 --> 00:45.650
To help people
achieve their true potential.

00:45.840 --> 00:47.649
<i>JOE: I know you want this
more than anything.</i>

00:47.840 --> 00:49.842
But you have to face the fact
that it might not happen.

00:50.040 --> 00:51.610
There's a whole multi-verse of
Harrison Wells out there.

00:51.800 --> 00:52.801
Call me H.R.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.128
<i>- You're</i> a <i>fake.
- H.R.: Let me prove my worth.</i>

00:55.360 --> 00:58.011
If I fail, I will...
Right back to my Earth.

00:58.240 --> 01:00.322
If Isucceed,
I will have done some good with my life.

<i>Caitlin, these powers you have,
the more you use them,</i>

01:03.560 --> 01:06.370

<i>WALLY". I'm fast, really fast.</i>

01:11.240 --> 01:13.527
<i>I might even be the fastest man alive.</i>

01:13.760 --> 01:16.969
<i>And when I'm running,
there's no greater feeling in the world.</i>

01:17.160 --> 01:19.766
<i>I can move through the city
like a guardian angel,</i>

01:19.960 --> 01:21.962

(PANTS)

01:27.440 --> 01:30.569
Whoa, you gotta slow down
and watch where you're going, okay?

01:30.760 --> 01:32.250
_OkaY-
_OkaY-

01:33.360 --> 01:35.249
- Cool skateboard, though.
-Thanks.

01:36.600 --> 01:40.810
They even have a name for me.
They call me Kid Flash.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.001
"Kid Flash"?

01:42.240 --> 01:44.288
Yeah, the name needs some work.
But, Dad, I'm telling you,

01:44.480 --> 01:47.723
it all just felt so real,
like it was actually happening.

01:48.560 --> 01:50.244
And how often
are you getting these dreams?

01:50.440 --> 01:51.566
Uh, last couple nights.

01:51.760 --> 01:53.000
Last couple?

01:53.480 --> 01:56.529
Wally, this is exactly what
Frankie Kane said happened to her.

01:56.760 --> 01:59.047
She had dreams, a lot of painful ones,

01:59.240 --> 02:01.049
and then she started hearing
Alchemy's voice in her head

02:01.240 --> 02:02.366
until she became Magenta.

02:02.600 --> 02:04.568
Yeah, this is totally different, Dad.

02:04.760 --> 02:06.888
No, no, it's not.

02:07.080 --> 02:09.002
Yes, it is. I'm a speedster in my dreams,

02:09.199 --> 02:11.521
I'm not an evil split personality.

02:11.720 --> 02:13.370
I'm helping people, not hurting them.

02:13.760 --> 02:17.526
Dad, this could mean
that my powers are finally manifesting.

02:18.280 --> 02:21.250
No, I think this means that you
have a lot in common right now

02:21.400 --> 02:24.006
with people who either
ended up in prison, or dead.

02:24.520 --> 02:26.568
Except for the fact
that I got hit by the dark matter

02:26.720 --> 02:29.564
from the particle accelerator explosion,
just like Jesse.

02:30.160 --> 02:32.731
(SIGHS) I'm going to class.

02:39.920 --> 02:43.083
Hey, Julian, do you want me to
get started on the DNA analysis for you?

02:43.240 --> 02:45.242
Mmm. Why would I need you to do that?

02:46.200 --> 02:49.761
I don't know, I just figured we worked
so well together last time.

02:50.080 --> 02:51.764
(SCOFFS) What?
That I'd want to do it again?

02:52.160 --> 02:56.085
One shared case and one shared drink
does not make us mates, okay?

02:56.400 --> 02:58.084
- Miss Horton.
-Mr. Allen.

02:58.280 --> 02:59.725
- Mr. Albert.
-Morning.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.206
(SIGHS) New one?

03:01.600 --> 03:03.602
Uh, yep, number six. Found it last night.

03:03.840 --> 03:05.729
Well, this should come as
a welcome surprise.

03:05.920 --> 03:08.764
You've been reassigned to meta-human
crime scene investigation full time.

03:09.040 --> 03:09.962
Full time?

03:10.200 --> 03:11.122
We're pouring all the resources we can

03:11.360 --> 03:13.442
into figuring out
this husk problem, especially

03:13.600 --> 03:16.570
considering the last one turned out
to be that evil speedster, the Rival.

03:16.800 --> 03:19.531
Any questions, concerns, you guys
direct them to Judge Hankerson, yeah?

03:19.760 --> 03:20.966
- All right. Thank you.
-(CLEARS THROAT)

03:23.200 --> 03:24.201
Joe.

03:24.400 --> 03:25.640
- Cecile.
-Hi.

03:25.880 --> 03:27.291
I didn't know you were gonna be over here.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.807
Any excuse I have to run into you,
I take it.

03:30.120 --> 03:32.088
(CHUCKUNG)

03:32.280 --> 03:34.203
You know, I'm really looking forward
to tomorrow night.

03:34.440 --> 03:35.441
- So am l.
-Yeah?

03:35.640 --> 03:37.802
- Yeah.
-Okay, good, then I, uh...

03:38.120 --> 03:40.327
- I'll see you then.
-Great.

03:41.760 --> 03:44.081
(WHISPERING)
Yo, is that what I think it was?

03:44.480 --> 03:45.811
You asked her to movie night with us?

03:45.960 --> 03:48.247
That's awesome.
When did you do that? How'd you do it?

03:48.440 --> 03:51.284
(WHISPERING) As much as I'd like to gossip
with you like a teenager right now,

03:51.480 --> 03:53.801
there's something else
we need to talk about.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.001
What?

03:55.240 --> 03:58.164
Wally. He's been having dreams.

03:58.400 --> 03:59.561
Dreams?

03:59.800 --> 04:04.647
Of saving people, becoming a speedster.
He called himself Kid Flash.

04:04.840 --> 04:07.764
Kid Flash? He said that name specifically?

04:07.960 --> 04:09.166
He's in trouble, isn't he?

04:09.320 --> 04:11.687
If Wally's having dreams
of being Kid Flash, then,

04:11.840 --> 04:12.841
yeah, he's in trouble.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.527
Yeah, but don't worry, okay?
We'll figure it out. I'll see you later.

04:16.680 --> 04:17.841
All right.

04:23.840 --> 04:26.002
- We have a problem.
-Yeah, we do.

04:26.200 --> 04:27.440
He's still here.

04:27.640 --> 04:29.847
(LAUGHS) Cisco, comedy of the obvious,

04:30.160 --> 04:34.324
I made a pact to justify my presence
on your Earth,

04:34.520 --> 04:36.488
and I think I got something.

04:36.960 --> 04:37.961
We're all ears.

04:38.160 --> 04:41.369
Okay, I read every news report
I can get my hands on,

04:41.600 --> 04:43.011
<i>and I have come to the conclusion that</i>

04:43.200 --> 04:45.885
this very operation
is a ticking time bomb.

04:46.320 --> 04:47.321
What do you mean?

04:47.520 --> 04:48.885
You can't spend all your time working on,

04:49.120 --> 04:51.009
working on whatever, whatever this is.

04:51.200 --> 04:56.161
This, this is a very delicate set
of power dampening cuffs.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.050
We need them to stop the meta-humans.

04:58.200 --> 05:01.090
My point exactly! It's not gonna be long

05:01.360 --> 05:03.249
before people start putting
the pieces together

05:03.400 --> 05:04.845
and figure out what you're doing here.

05:05.040 --> 05:07.042
You're working with the Flash!

05:07.400 --> 05:08.561
Okay, so what's your idea?

05:08.720 --> 05:10.290
<i>The perfect disguise!</i>

05:10.520 --> 05:13.285
We reopen this laboratory,

05:13.600 --> 05:20.051
and I become the face of
the new S.T.A.R. Labs Museum!

05:20.520 --> 05:22.363
There's only one problem with that.

05:22.720 --> 05:23.767
It's your face.

05:23.920 --> 05:26.241
You're kind of a known murderer
around these parts.

05:26.880 --> 05:28.723
You see, the evil Wells,

05:28.920 --> 05:31.651
not to be confused with
the dick-ish, but not evil, Wells,

05:31.880 --> 05:34.247
he confessed to killing Barry's mother.

05:34.400 --> 05:38.724
So basically, if you step foot
outside this lab, you'll be arrested.

05:38.920 --> 05:41.287
You're just telling me this now?
You two rascals.

05:41.560 --> 05:43.289
<i>What about the cryptogram?
What about the message,</i>

05:43.440 --> 05:44.601
"Come to this Earth, get a fresh start"?

05:44.800 --> 05:48.327
Well, what about your resume
as a world renowned genius scientist?

05:50.440 --> 05:52.761
That's a good point. I guess we're even.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.809
"If a string is in a knot,
patience will untie it.

05:55.080 --> 05:57.287
"Patience can do lots of things,
have you ever tried it?"

05:57.440 --> 05:59.442
<i>My dear ma used to say that
to me all the time,</i>

05:59.600 --> 06:02.171
anytime I had a problem.
Now I have a problem.

06:02.400 --> 06:04.607
I guess I'm gonna use that adage
to figure it out.

06:05.440 --> 06:07.920
S.T.A.R. Labs Museum. Think about it.

06:09.440 --> 06:10.805
You think everyone on Earth-19

06:10.960 --> 06:13.850
is missing crayons in the box,
or just him?

06:16.920 --> 06:18.445
Paging Dr. Snow.

06:19.320 --> 06:21.288
Wow. You are out of it.

06:21.480 --> 06:22.481
Sorry.

06:22.640 --> 06:24.927
Does it have anything to do
with your recent visit with Mom?

06:25.120 --> 06:28.010
I just, I haven't been sleeping well,
but I'm okay.

06:28.840 --> 06:29.921
Coffee.

06:30.160 --> 06:31.366
- Perfect.
-(CHUCKLES)

06:39.520 --> 06:43.127
So I did have powers. I was Kid Flash.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.049
In Flashpoint, yes.

06:46.640 --> 06:49.530
I knew that this was happening.
Why didn't you tell me before?

06:49.800 --> 06:51.165
Because“.

06:51.360 --> 06:52.850
Because why?

06:53.360 --> 06:55.044
All right, fine, Wally. Yeah, look.

06:55.440 --> 06:58.808
In that timeline,
you were fighting the Rival.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.161
Edward Clariss?

07:00.360 --> 07:02.840
Edward Clariss, yeah.
You couldn't stop him.

07:03.040 --> 07:06.681
There was no S.T.A.R. Labs,
there was no team to help you.

07:06.880 --> 07:08.120
It was just you and Iris.

07:08.360 --> 07:13.366
The two of you were a brother-sister
superhero crime fighting team.

07:14.240 --> 07:16.527
Why didn't you tell us this before?

07:16.720 --> 07:19.371
You didn't wanna know about
your Flashpoint lives.

07:19.680 --> 07:21.170
But, look, listen to me.

07:21.360 --> 07:22.521
You got hurt.

07:23.040 --> 07:25.361
All right? You got hurt bad.

07:25.760 --> 07:28.969
So what? That's that me, it's not this me.

07:29.200 --> 07:32.363
And I wanna be a speedster.
I mean, I wanna be a Flash.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.124
No. No. No, no, you don't.

07:34.360 --> 07:35.282
Yes, I do.

07:35.520 --> 07:37.887
Are you not hearing what he's saying?
He's telling us it's not safe.

07:38.080 --> 07:39.969
Who cares what Barry's saying?

07:40.200 --> 07:41.565
How do we even know
he's telling the truth?

07:41.760 --> 07:44.206
Wally, come on. This isn't because
of the particle accelerator,

07:44.440 --> 07:45.487
it's because of Doctor Alchemy.

07:45.720 --> 07:47.722
It's the same thing
that happened to Frankie Kane.

07:47.880 --> 07:49.211
WALLY: <i>You don't know that.
JOE: Yes, we do,</i>

07:49.440 --> 07:51.442
and we need to try
to keep it from happening.

07:51.640 --> 07:53.722
Why don't we just say
what this is really about?

07:53.920 --> 07:55.570
You're okay with Barry having powers,

07:55.720 --> 07:58.087
you're okay with Barry running
into danger, fighting all these metas.

07:58.280 --> 07:59.884
He can screw up over and over again.

08:00.080 --> 08:03.448
You're okay with all of it.
Because he's Barry.

08:03.720 --> 08:05.449
But you won't give me
the same amount of leeway,

08:05.640 --> 08:08.610
because at the end of the day,
you just don't trust me.

08:08.840 --> 08:10.080
You know that's not true, Wally.

08:10.280 --> 08:12.282
I don't need you fighting
my dad's battles for him.

08:12.600 --> 08:13.965
Say it, Joe.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.922
You don't trust me, do you?

08:17.800 --> 08:18.926
Wally!

08:19.400 --> 08:21.004
That's what I thought.

08:23.680 --> 08:24.920
Hey, hey--

08:25.640 --> 08:27.290
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

08:30.320 --> 08:32.640
No, you're not listening to me.

08:33.120 --> 08:34.929
I said the shares are undervalued,

08:35.159 --> 08:37.845
so if the stock drops,
you should buy more, not less.

08:39.159 --> 08:41.128
No, that's-- not how it works.

08:41.320 --> 08:43.129
Look, just look at its balance sheet.

08:44.840 --> 08:46.649
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

08:47.320 --> 08:49.607
If you sell now,
you're going to lose a lot of money.

08:51.600 --> 08:53.045
I understand that.

08:53.520 --> 08:55.010
No, of course, it's your money.

08:55.360 --> 08:56.964
Just hold onto it then.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.646
You know what?
If you're not gonna listen...

09:19.400 --> 09:22.722
<i>JULIAN: Petechiae around eye,
the crushed larynx.</i>

09:22.960 --> 09:25.406
This poor chap,
he's got fingerprints around his neck,

09:25.640 --> 09:26.801
he's clearly been strangled.

09:27.040 --> 09:30.487
I heard multiple witnesses said
the man was attacked by a shadow.

09:31.240 --> 09:34.164
Huh? So a meta from Neverland's made
the trip to Central City. Fabulous.

09:34.320 --> 09:36.687
So far there's no forensic evidence
that there was an assailant.

09:36.840 --> 09:39.320
No laceration marks, no fingernail marks.

09:39.520 --> 09:41.682
No DNA evidence underneath
the fingernails even?

09:41.880 --> 09:43.006
Nothing yet, we'll have to wait and see.

09:43.200 --> 09:44.326
There's always something.

09:44.560 --> 09:46.927
Ah... Bag the body up,
and I'll meet you back at the lab.

09:47.160 --> 09:48.161
- Yeah.
-See ya.

09:48.400 --> 09:53.770
Oh, Julian, uh, I'm going to that
Movie in the Park thing with Joe and his--

09:54.000 --> 09:57.004
Or my... Iris and some other friends.

09:57.240 --> 09:59.083
Uh, if you felt like going,
it starts at 8:00.

09:59.320 --> 10:02.608
All a bunch of nerds,
so you'll fit right in.

10:02.920 --> 10:04.888
(CHUCKLES)
That's a very enticing offer, Allen,

10:05.120 --> 10:07.088
but I'm actually seeing
my girlfriend tonight, so...

10:07.280 --> 10:09.442
Oh, you have a girlfriend?
I didn't know that.

10:10.280 --> 10:13.409
I'm sure there's lots about me
that you don't know. Cheerio.

10:14.160 --> 10:15.127
- Yeah.
-JOE: Albert.

10:15.320 --> 10:16.321
J U LIAN: Detective.

10:16.520 --> 10:17.760
- Hey.
-Anything?

10:18.080 --> 10:20.686
(STAMMERS) Nothing yet at least.

10:20.880 --> 10:22.120
Have you seen Wally this morning?

10:22.320 --> 10:23.367
No, why?

10:23.600 --> 10:25.125
He left the house in a huff,

10:25.320 --> 10:26.731
he won't answer my calls.

10:26.920 --> 10:28.206
Iris is out there
looking for him right now.

10:28.440 --> 10:29.601
Do you want me to run around the city?

10:29.800 --> 10:32.451
Maybe if I can't get a hold of him.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.882
What Wally said, it's partially true.

10:35.080 --> 10:37.560
I didn't answer his question
because I don't trust him

10:37.760 --> 10:40.161
with these powers the same way
I trust you with them.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.522
You gotta talk to him about that.

10:42.720 --> 10:45.087
You know, tell him why. Especially now.

10:45.280 --> 10:47.203
I will. I mean,
I just gotta find him first.

10:47.400 --> 10:49.801
Look, I'll just keep calling him,
he's gotta answer at some point, right?

10:50.040 --> 10:52.247
Man, I feel bad, too.
It's your first date with Cecile,

10:52.440 --> 10:53.487
and you gotta worry about this.

10:53.680 --> 10:55.170
Don't worry about that.

10:55.360 --> 10:57.044
- That's one part of my life I can control.
-(CHUCKLING)

11:02.360 --> 11:03.441
Yes?

11:03.840 --> 11:05.046
Have you seen H.R.?

11:05.240 --> 11:06.924
Maybe he's meditating in his room?

11:07.120 --> 11:08.610
No, he's not there.

11:08.800 --> 11:10.609
H.R., you're needed in the speed lab, now.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.644
He could be doing
inversion stretches in the intake.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.969
You saw that, too, huh?
H.R.? He's not there.

11:17.160 --> 11:19.288
Probablyjust brewing another
pot of coffee, it's all he drinks.

11:19.480 --> 11:21.084
- Not that, either.
-Okay.

11:21.320 --> 11:22.924
Why do you need him so badly?

11:23.360 --> 11:24.486
He's going through my stuff,

11:24.680 --> 11:28.401
but now he's just being stupid about it!

11:28.600 --> 11:30.284
Stupid about what?

11:31.000 --> 11:34.766
God, I swear I fixed the security system.
Who the hell are you?

11:35.000 --> 11:36.286
H.R.?

11:38.560 --> 11:40.244
(CHUCKLES) Um, apologies.

11:44.760 --> 11:46.524
H.R.! See?

11:46.880 --> 11:48.291
Ah! What you've just been witness to

11:48.520 --> 11:50.966
was my partner's likeness, Randolf Morgan.

11:51.160 --> 11:53.049
Okay, I see what's going on here.

11:53.240 --> 11:57.404
You don't have facial transmogrification
on this planet, do you?

11:57.600 --> 11:59.045
No, we certainly do not.

11:59.360 --> 12:01.442
(CHUCKLES) Well, then,
it's a good thing for me

12:01.640 --> 12:03.005
I found this little contraption
in my satchel.

12:03.240 --> 12:05.686
Forgot I'd brought it. It's so fun.

12:05.880 --> 12:07.166
So fun. How does this work?

12:07.360 --> 12:09.124
Light refraction technology.

12:09.320 --> 12:10.651
Light refraction?

12:10.840 --> 12:13.730
I think, I don't--
Randolf, my business partner,

12:13.960 --> 12:16.406
he's sort of more with the science,
but this little sucker

12:16.600 --> 12:20.002
is gonna go a long way to solving
my Harrison Wells facial issues.

12:20.200 --> 12:23.488
I'm gonna hang onto this
until I get my power cuffs back.

12:23.720 --> 12:25.848
Wait, your power cuffs?

12:26.040 --> 12:27.769
Your meta-human power dampening cuffs?

12:27.960 --> 12:30.770
Those very ones,
the ones that are missing all of a sudden.

12:30.960 --> 12:32.291
Wait, you think I took 'em?

12:32.840 --> 12:34.285
I didn't take 'em.
What do I need cuffs for?

12:34.520 --> 12:35.726
I just got to this Earth, I came alone.

12:35.920 --> 12:37.206
I haven't met anyone yet.

12:37.440 --> 12:38.601
It's gonna take a while,

12:38.800 --> 12:40.848
even when I do meet them,
to get to the cuff stage.

12:41.080 --> 12:42.366
<i>BARRY". Hey, guys?</i>

12:43.880 --> 12:45.484
<i>-(H.R. SIGHS)
- Guys, I need you in the Cortex.</i>

12:46.960 --> 12:49.486
Killed by a shadow? That's a new one.

12:49.680 --> 12:51.523
Maybe that's what killed Edward Clariss.

12:51.720 --> 12:55.486
Clariss was a meta-human.
This victim doesn't appear to be.

12:55.680 --> 12:57.091
Do we know if this shadow meta

12:57.280 --> 13:00.204
is from the particle accelerator explosion
or from Doctor Alchemy?

13:00.400 --> 13:04.121
Not yet, no. We actually haven't found
any evidence to process.

13:04.320 --> 13:07.722
If only we had a way, Francisco,
to see what happened.

13:07.920 --> 13:08.967
Where's the crime scene located?

13:09.160 --> 13:13.324
In Chubbuck. Uh, Palmer and Racine,
around 11:00 last night.

13:14.760 --> 13:16.171
-(MONITOR BEEPING)
- H.R.: <i>Whoa!</i>

13:16.360 --> 13:17.691
<i>CISCO: Ooh, that's gonna
give me night terrors.</i>

13:17.880 --> 13:18.847
Shade.

13:19.040 --> 13:20.007
What?

13:20.200 --> 13:21.645
Well, we had a meta-hominid on my planet.

13:21.840 --> 13:24.081
He could do virtually the same thing,
called himself Shade.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.607
What did he do?
Throw his side eye at his enemies?

13:26.800 --> 13:28.325
No, I know,
it's a terrible nickname, right?

13:28.520 --> 13:31.000
But what Shade could do was
vibrate at such a high frequency,

13:31.240 --> 13:33.811
he created the illusion
that he was a shadow.

13:34.040 --> 13:35.371
It's how I phase.

13:35.840 --> 13:37.046
Do you think he's doing the same thing?

13:37.240 --> 13:41.086
He has to be. Heat signature's
fluctuating, redshift is ridiculous.

13:41.280 --> 13:42.327
Okay, so, he is.

13:42.520 --> 13:45.251
He must be slowing down
his molecules whenever he attacks.

13:45.440 --> 13:48.330
So we just have to figure out a way
to keep them slowed down,

13:48.520 --> 13:50.124
and that should be enough to grab him.

13:50.320 --> 13:51.481
All right, can you get started?

13:51.720 --> 13:52.767
Okay, but, like, right this minute?

13:52.960 --> 13:54.803
Yeah, I'm sorry, we just,
we gotta stop this guy fast

13:55.000 --> 13:56.729
so we can focus on Alchemy. We've got...

13:57.200 --> 14:01.364
Wally has been having dreams
about being a speedster.

14:02.600 --> 14:04.204
Alchemy dreams.

14:05.160 --> 14:06.924
He was a speedster in Flashpoint?

14:08.720 --> 14:11.246
Anyone else gonna have powers
we should know about?

14:12.080 --> 14:13.161
No.

14:13.880 --> 14:16.360
- All right. I'm gonna work on Shade.
-I'll supervise.

14:16.560 --> 14:17.561
You're gonna find my cuffs.

14:17.760 --> 14:18.841
Hope to find some cuffs.

14:19.120 --> 14:22.488
All right, I gotta get back to work
before Julian loses his mind.

14:27.160 --> 14:28.889
- Wally, it's your dad again.
-(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

14:29.080 --> 14:30.320
Just give me a call back, all right?

14:30.520 --> 14:32.488
Or a text.
I just need to know you're okay.

14:32.720 --> 14:33.960
I'm okay.

14:34.160 --> 14:35.321
Wally.

14:36.400 --> 14:39.244
You can't do that.
You can't just disappear.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.770
I just wanted to let you know
I'm fine, so...

14:43.200 --> 14:45.123
- Come here.
-(EXHALES SHARPLY)

14:52.360 --> 14:54.362
Listen, you were right.

14:54.720 --> 14:57.803
I do treat Barry differently
than I treat you.

14:58.040 --> 15:00.042
But not because I think
Barry's better than you.

15:00.240 --> 15:01.366
Then why?

15:01.560 --> 15:03.767
Wally, you're a lot like I was as a kid.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.810
You're fearless, and you take risks,
and that makes you a handful,

15:07.000 --> 15:08.161
just like I was.

15:08.320 --> 15:10.846
And now, you're getting powers.

15:11.080 --> 15:13.401
<i>That alone would make me nervous,</i>

15:13.640 --> 15:15.847
because I know what
I would've done if I got powers.

15:16.080 --> 15:20.608
But you're not getting your speed
the same way Barry got his.

15:20.840 --> 15:24.162
You're getting your speed the way
Magenta and the Rival got theirs.

15:24.360 --> 15:26.601
<i>So it's not that I don't trust you,
Wally, it's just,</i>

15:26.800 --> 15:29.371
I don't trust what's going on
with you right now,

15:29.600 --> 15:31.523
<i>and that scares the living hell out of me.</i>

15:31.760 --> 15:34.286
I know, Dad. I get it.

15:35.440 --> 15:38.603
Okay, so, let's get you
to S.T.A.R. Labs and see what we can do.

15:38.800 --> 15:39.847
All right.

15:41.520 --> 15:43.124

<i>CAITLIN: Hey, Cisco.</i>

16:01.040 --> 16:02.121
Yes?

16:02.640 --> 16:04.290
I took your cuffs.

16:06.480 --> 16:07.561
Why?

16:07.840 --> 16:08.887
Because I need them.

16:09.040 --> 16:11.520
Is this some sort of,
um, bold fashion choice,

16:11.720 --> 16:14.485
'cause you're not a meta-human...

16:15.720 --> 16:16.846
Surprise.

16:22.560 --> 16:24.369
It started a few months ago.

16:24.560 --> 16:26.801
That's why you went to see your mom,
to see if she could help you.

16:27.040 --> 16:29.691
But she can't. I've run every test.

16:29.920 --> 16:31.922
There's nothing that anyone can do.

16:32.160 --> 16:33.366
<i>I need a favor.</i>

16:34.840 --> 16:38.401
I need you to vibe me in the future

16:38.920 --> 16:43.562
because I need to know if I become her.

16:44.680 --> 16:46.762
You're not gonna become her, okay.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.002
Just because you have these powers

16:49.200 --> 16:51.567
doesn't mean you're gonna
turn into Killer Frost.

16:51.920 --> 16:53.251
I think it might.

16:53.600 --> 16:57.047
Please, I just need to know for sure.

16:57.680 --> 17:00.286
I need to know if I become evil,

17:00.520 --> 17:03.091

17:41.440 --> 17:45.126
Please, um, don't tell anyone
about this yet, okay?

17:45.760 --> 17:47.205
- Of course.
-Okay.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.810
According to this,
all your vitals are fine, Wally.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.331
Wally, what did you see?

18:02.560 --> 18:05.723
I was Kid Flash again,
but this time it wasn't a good dream.

18:05.960 --> 18:09.681
I was fighting with the Rival
at some abandoned sawmill.

18:09.840 --> 18:12.684
That's what happened
in Flashpoint before you got hurt.

18:12.880 --> 18:16.009
They're not just dreams,
they must be memories of that life.

18:16.240 --> 18:18.004
A lot more people are getting powers.

18:18.240 --> 18:19.401
<i>IRIS: Okay, so how do we stop this?</i>

18:19.640 --> 18:21.529
I mean, is there any stopping it, even?

18:21.680 --> 18:24.047
If Alchemy could reach you at C.C.P.D.,

18:24.200 --> 18:25.406
he could probably reach you
from anywhere, right?

18:25.640 --> 18:28.086
I have a suggestion.
Why don't we throw Wallace

18:28.320 --> 18:29.845
in The Pipeline till we figure
this situation out?

18:30.080 --> 18:31.241
You wanna lock him up?

18:31.480 --> 18:33.687
Yeah, I agree with Joe.
We lock him up because, think about this,

18:33.880 --> 18:36.884
we can't stop Alchemy from
getting into Wallace's head,

18:37.040 --> 18:38.201
but put him in The Pipeline,

18:38.360 --> 18:41.250
then we control the situation
from there on out.

18:41.720 --> 18:45.167
As much as I don't like it, Dad,
maybe he's not wrong.

18:45.560 --> 18:48.211
But only till we figure out
a better way to make you safe.

18:48.400 --> 18:49.606
Yeah, I agree with Joe.

18:49.840 --> 18:52.002
I'm gonna cancel this movie with Cecile.

18:52.600 --> 18:55.444
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait.
You've got a date with Cecile?

18:55.680 --> 18:58.763
Yeah, I was gonna bring her
to Movie in the Park tonight.

18:59.040 --> 19:00.087
Well, don't not go.

19:00.360 --> 19:02.249
<i>You've put your life on hold
for all of us long enough.</i>

19:02.440 --> 19:06.570
Yeah, Dad, he's right. I mean,
go be "Joe West," you're always "Dad."

19:06.720 --> 19:08.722
Yeah, we'll stay with Wally,
make sure nothing happens.

19:08.960 --> 19:10.689
I told her all of you were coming with me,

19:10.920 --> 19:12.251
am I gonna be the only one that shows up?

19:12.400 --> 19:16.405
Uh, I would love to see a movie.
What movie is this?

19:16.600 --> 19:17.601
<i>JOE: The Shining.</i>

19:17.880 --> 19:19.803
The Shining! Oh, I love that movie.

19:20.040 --> 19:21.041
That movie freaks you out!

19:21.240 --> 19:23.720
<i>You've never made it past
the part with the Grady twins.</i>

19:23.920 --> 19:26.241
(STAMMERS) That was... I was younger.

19:26.400 --> 19:27.765
I might go with you.

19:28.080 --> 19:30.128
- You sure you don't wanna stay?
-No, I wanna be with you.

19:30.360 --> 19:31.725
Either way, the more the merrier.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.968
Let's do it! Yeah, this'll be
great fodder for my novel.

19:34.200 --> 19:36.601
Hold on. You guys didn't tell him about...

19:36.760 --> 19:39.127
Joe, no, they told me.

19:39.400 --> 19:41.243
Finally! The little scamps.

19:41.440 --> 19:45.923
But I think that I have worked
my way around that little problem.

19:46.120 --> 19:48.407
Watch this.

19:50.600 --> 19:51.647
Oh...

19:52.240 --> 19:54.288
Oh, um, let me just...

19:56.280 --> 19:57.441
(STAMMERS) What did you do?

19:57.600 --> 19:58.806
Did you just neuralyze us?

19:58.960 --> 20:03.284
No, I gave you a simple retinal adjustment
so all of you can see me,

20:03.480 --> 20:06.962
H.R., while the rest of the world sees

have to leave soon.

31:08.040 --> 31:10.520
I vibed the two of us
fighting each other in the future.

31:12.800 --> 31:14.370
She was Killer Frost.

31:15.320 --> 31:17.129
<i>- H.R.: I'll go talk to her.
- I <i>got it.</i></i>

31:35.160 --> 31:36.321
(SIGHS)

31:38.720 --> 31:40.245
How long have you known?

31:41.160 --> 31:42.400
A few months.

31:44.920 --> 31:47.571
First, I didn't wanna accept
what was happening to me.

31:48.080 --> 31:49.525
<i>But then I had to.</i>

31:49.760 --> 31:53.242
So then, I tried to suppress my powers.

31:55.240 --> 31:57.083
There's no suppressing these powers.

31:59.920 --> 32:02.002
I just can't believe that this is my life.

32:02.200 --> 32:03.531
It shouldn't be.

32:04.600 --> 32:06.887
None of what's happening
to any of you should be.

32:07.400 --> 32:08.765
What do you mean, "Any of us"?

32:09.000 --> 32:10.764
I mean... (EXHALES)

32:11.680 --> 32:13.011
Doctor Alchemy,

32:13.240 --> 32:16.767
Wally, you getting powers.

32:17.080 --> 32:19.924
<i>Even Dante being dead in this timeline.</i>

32:22.280 --> 32:26.251
It's all because I created Flashpoint.
Even Iris, who...

32:26.440 --> 32:28.249
I don't know, I think she's disappointed

32:28.440 --> 32:30.363
that she doesn't have powers
and everyone else does.

32:30.560 --> 32:33.404
And no matter what I do now,
everything's different.

32:34.960 --> 32:37.042
So none of this happened before?

32:41.360 --> 32:42.885
- I'm sorry, Caitlin.
-(DOOR OPENS)

32:43.920 --> 32:45.126
Wally's UP-

32:46.280 --> 32:47.406
Okay.

32:51.040 --> 32:52.246
JOE: How you feeling?

32:52.440 --> 32:53.726
I've been better.

32:53.960 --> 32:56.566
- What do we do?
-We gotta come up with something.

32:57.160 --> 32:58.286
Use me.

32:58.480 --> 33:00.164
No. No, no, hell no.

33:00.400 --> 33:02.607
Alchemy's calling for me to go to him.

33:03.280 --> 33:06.921
Follow me to wherever he is,
and we can stop him.

33:07.240 --> 33:09.481
No, we're not asking you to do that.

33:09.800 --> 33:12.246
This is our chance to stop him,
we have to do it.

33:12.400 --> 33:13.481
Wally...

33:14.320 --> 33:19.326
Dad, he wants me, he's hurting me,
so let me fight back.

33:19.600 --> 33:21.170
(GRUNTING)

33:21.960 --> 33:23.689
- Wally?
-(GROANING)

- CAITLIN: <i>Turn</i> him on his <i>side.</i>

33:35.200 --> 33:36.281
All right, get him over, come on.

33:36.440 --> 33:39.125
This should help. It's a mild sedative.

33:39.320 --> 33:41.004
- What is that?
-Lorazepam. It works on seizures,

33:41.280 --> 33:43.328
hopefully it'll work on whatever this is.

33:43.520 --> 33:45.488
These episodes keep happening
more frequently.

33:45.680 --> 33:46.966
<i>CAITLIN: Yeah,
and this is just a <i>temporary fix.</i></i>

33:47.160 --> 33:50.209
If we don't stop it, he could suffer
from permanent brain damage.

33:50.440 --> 33:51.805
<i>JOE". We don't have a choice.</i>

33:52.160 --> 33:54.845
We have to do what Wally wanted,
we have to use him to find Alchemy.

33:55.040 --> 33:56.280
No, we're-- It's too dangerous.

33:56.480 --> 33:58.289
So is doing nothing.

33:58.640 --> 34:01.644
Need I remind everyone that Doctor Alchemy
has a rock that shoots lasers,

34:01.800 --> 34:03.689
so who knows what he has up his sleeve?

34:03.880 --> 34:06.326
Cisco's right.
What if we're walking into a trap?

34:06.560 --> 34:07.891
You guys aren't walking into anything.

34:08.120 --> 34:09.326
You guys are gonna stay here.

34:09.560 --> 34:11.050
If we're gonna do this,
we're gonna do it right.

34:11.280 --> 34:12.327
What does that mean?

34:12.480 --> 34:13.686
It means that if I'm gonna
put Wally at risk,

34:13.880 --> 34:16.246
I'm gonna use everything
in my power to protect him.

34:17.800 --> 34:20.201
AGENT 1: Double-check your packs,
make sure we have everything.

34:20.400 --> 34:21.731
AGENT 2: Good to go.
AGENT 1: Yeah.

34:22.960 --> 34:24.166
(GUN COCKS)

34:25.639 --> 34:26.880
So what's the plan, Detective?

34:27.159 --> 34:29.481
This lunatic calls himself Alchemy.

34:29.679 --> 34:31.250
He's the one responsible
for all these husks

34:31.480 --> 34:32.844
we've been finding all over town.

34:33.040 --> 34:35.327
But we believe we've found a way
to get his location.

34:35.480 --> 34:36.561
How?

34:37.239 --> 34:38.400
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

34:38.760 --> 34:40.762
By using his next target.

34:41.920 --> 34:44.321
Your son? We'll stop him, Joe.

34:48.840 --> 34:49.841
Where's Julian?

34:50.000 --> 34:51.239
He didn't come in today.

34:51.520 --> 34:52.760
What? He never misses a day. You call him?

34:53.000 --> 34:54.525
Yeah, it went straight to voice-mail.

34:55.159 --> 34:56.366
Well.

34:56.840 --> 34:58.001
All right, gents, move out.

34:58.200 --> 34:59.201
Let's roll.

34:59.400 --> 35:01.528
All right, be safe. I'll see you in a few.

35:03.840 --> 35:05.046
You ready?

35:05.200 --> 35:06.201
Yeah.

35:06.360 --> 35:10.126
Hey, you remember when I said that
you remind me of myself as a kid?

35:10.920 --> 35:12.888
I was never this brave.

35:16.680 --> 35:17.886
CAITLIN: They've just left.

35:18.080 --> 35:19.969
I'm almost done, I'll be right there.

35:21.200 --> 35:24.602
Cisco, I'm so sorry about how I reacted.

35:25.280 --> 35:27.567
I understand why you told everyone.

35:28.200 --> 35:29.884
It never helps when we keep things
from each other.

35:30.080 --> 35:33.971
You're right, and I'm glad
that you told everyone.

35:35.640 --> 35:37.802
I'm just not very good at asking for help.

35:39.120 --> 35:40.963
I get that from my mom.

35:41.560 --> 35:43.164
You're better than your mother.

35:43.640 --> 35:45.085
I don't know.

35:45.800 --> 35:49.168
I'm just so terrified because
she said if I keep using my powers,

35:49.400 --> 35:52.643
then it'll be impossible to stop them.

35:56.440 --> 36:01.241
Your mother might be one of the most
accomplished scientists on this planet,

36:01.920 --> 36:03.843
but when it comes to the impossible?

36:05.640 --> 36:07.085

36:10.920 --> 36:12.763

36:12.960 --> 36:14.325
Okay. (CHUCKLES)

36:14.640 --> 36:16.005
Let's go help Wally.

Of course dude uses
an abandoned subway to set up shop.

36:37.600 --> 36:38.522
Of course he does.

-Grodd-- Gorilla Grodd?

Hello, Wally.

38:18.280 --> 38:19.611

38:22.640 --> 38:25.041
Are you the voice

38:25.960 --> 38:28.725
I am Alchemy.

I just want the pain to stop.

38:49.920 --> 38:51.410
It Will, child.

38:52.080 --> 38:55.687
Whatever you desire, I will see it so.

38:56.080 --> 39:01.120
Now tell me, do you wish for the life
that was taken from you

39:01.800 --> 39:03.165
to return?

39:04.920 --> 39:06.684
What I wish for

39:08.000 --> 39:09.843
