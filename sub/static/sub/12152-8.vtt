00:02.373 --> 00:04.841
I've been asked to present my article
at the Physics Institute.

00:05.013 --> 00:07.652
- Winifred Burkle.
FRED: Thank you, professor.

00:07.813 --> 00:10.964
- Why are you dressed like that?
- Isn't this what you like?

00:12.653 --> 00:13.972
Leave them on.

00:14.453 --> 00:17.206
- Can we not do this?
- We haven't touched each other since...

00:17.373 --> 00:20.410
- Since we murdered Professor Seidel.
- No, since I did.

00:20.573 --> 00:21.926
I'm sorry.

00:22.093 --> 00:23.811
I've been here before.

00:23.973 --> 00:27.568
Oh, my God.
Connor, this is where you were born.

00:32.893 --> 00:35.202
You've noticed an increase
in paranormal activity.

00:35.413 --> 00:36.971
You stepped in some
on your way in.

00:37.133 --> 00:40.284
That's everything Wolfram and Hart
could decipher from Lorne.

00:40.453 --> 00:43.172
- The Eye of Fire.
WESLEY: Alchemical symbol for fire.

00:43.333 --> 00:44.322
ANGEL:
And destruction.

00:44.493 --> 00:47.371
I hate to be the demon
that cried "apocalypse nowish," but...

ANGEL: <i>Whatever's coming,</i>
<i>that's where we'll find it</i>.

00:49.893 --> 00:51.406
The Kimball Building's there.

CORDELIA: <i>No one's safe.</i>
<i>It's coming, and no one can stop it.</i>

00:59.093 --> 01:02.324
Do you really think she's safe with him?

01:08.653 --> 01:10.245
CORDELIA:
You never had a childhood...

01:10.453 --> 01:12.205
...or family or friends...

01:12.373 --> 01:14.682
...or anything that's real.

01:14.853 --> 01:18.289

I want you to have something that is.

No, that's right. Yes, ma'am.
Angel Invest...

03:31.213 --> 03:34.569
I know. It is scary, but...

03:35.693 --> 03:38.969
But if she's only an hour late...

03:39.133 --> 03:41.488
I'm just saying, maybe
it's a bit early to panic.

03:41.653 --> 03:45.282
A little fire falling from the sky doesn't
necessarily mean the end of...

03:48.013 --> 03:49.207
Oh, my God.

03:52.053 --> 03:54.487
I thought you were dead.

03:55.893 --> 03:58.805
I got back here, and it was empty,
and I panicked...

03:58.973 --> 04:01.931
...and the radio and the fires.
- I know, baby. I know. Me too.

04:02.093 --> 04:04.527
It was the end of the world,
and all I wanted was you.

04:04.693 --> 04:07.412
But you're safe now.

04:07.573 --> 04:08.801
All of you.

04:08.973 --> 04:11.089
Yes. All safe.

04:14.333 --> 04:16.209
What about Angel?
Where's Angel?

04:16.373 --> 04:18.807
We got separated.
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

04:19.613 --> 04:23.128
What about you? You okay?

04:23.293 --> 04:25.443
I'm fine.

04:25.613 --> 04:28.411
I just needed some air.

04:28.573 --> 04:32.202
I didn't know I'd be gone so long.

04:32.373 --> 04:34.489
Looks like there's other things
I didn't know.

04:34.653 --> 04:36.803
Time for updates later.
We need to regroup.

04:36.973 --> 04:40.568
Think about getting back out there and
mixing it up with that demon-y thing.

04:40.733 --> 04:42.451
That's not what Angel would do.

04:42.613 --> 04:45.764
Thanks for your opinion,
and I don't remember asking.

04:46.493 --> 04:48.165
What demon-y thing?

04:48.333 --> 04:50.688
Oh, I believe he was
referring to the big, bad...

04:50.853 --> 04:54.209
...possibly invincible demon-y thing
that nearly killed us all...

04:54.373 --> 04:57.331
...before he ringmastered
tonight's Cirque du Flamb <i>e</i>.

04:57.493 --> 05:01.168
Is that the "pain, suffering and despair"
thing you saw when you read Cordelia?

05:01.333 --> 05:04.723
Afraid so, peanut. And if there
was ever truth in advertising...

05:07.093 --> 05:11.132
Charles, if he's really that big and bad,
maybe we should wait for Angel.

05:11.293 --> 05:12.726
If he couldn't stop him...

05:12.893 --> 05:15.282
So we wait because we don't
know what Angel would do?

05:15.453 --> 05:16.966
Would I do what?

05:17.133 --> 05:19.693
Angel. You're hurt.

05:20.893 --> 05:22.246
I'll be...

05:22.853 --> 05:25.925
Let's talk about it in the morning.

05:26.093 --> 05:30.291
What about Cordelia and Connor?
Has anyone checked in on them?

05:31.413 --> 05:34.007
- Angel?
- They're fine.

05:34.173 --> 05:36.004
You saw them?

05:37.933 --> 05:39.605
Man looks like he was hit by a tank.

05:39.773 --> 05:42.207
I don't remember seeing
him that down after a fight.

05:42.373 --> 05:47.128
Can't really blame him. No one likes
to lose, whatever the circumstance.

06:35.653 --> 06:37.325
Morning.

06:38.133 --> 06:40.010
Did the world end?

06:40.173 --> 06:42.289
Not exactly.

06:42.453 --> 06:45.126
So that's a good thing.

06:49.773 --> 06:51.525
Don't do that.

06:51.693 --> 06:54.412
- Do what?
- That.

06:55.373 --> 06:57.329
The look.

06:57.493 --> 07:00.530
The happy puppy look.
Makes it harder.

07:01.413 --> 07:03.449
Makes what harder?

07:10.453 --> 07:13.126
You're very special, Connor.

07:14.413 --> 07:16.847
Last night will always be special.

07:17.013 --> 07:19.368
It's something we both needed.

07:19.533 --> 07:22.889
But it happened because
of unusual circumstances.

07:23.053 --> 07:27.126
- Understand what I'm saying?
- Yeah, that it was special.

07:27.773 --> 07:29.968
That it can't happen again.

07:30.133 --> 07:31.452
But...

07:32.733 --> 07:34.451
Why?

07:40.173 --> 07:42.289
You're Angel's son.

07:43.453 --> 07:46.013
It rained fire last night.
Never a good sign.

07:46.173 --> 07:50.246
And a giant demon-y beast crawled out
from the earth where you were born.

07:50.413 --> 07:52.529
- You think it's my fault.
- No.

07:52.693 --> 07:56.322
- I told you last night I didn't. I said...
- You said a lot of things last night.

07:58.093 --> 08:00.846
You said that it didn't matter anymore.

08:02.013 --> 08:04.925
- That we were real.
- And I meant them.

08:05.093 --> 08:07.561
Yeah, then.
Today, it's all my fault.

08:07.733 --> 08:11.612
- You know, the fire, demon, all of it.
- Don't be...

08:12.253 --> 08:15.563
- Look, all I said was...
- That I can't be with you.

08:56.493 --> 08:58.882
I left you a couple hundred
messages last night.

08:59.573 --> 09:02.849
Don't feel obligated to return any.

- And you're all right?
- I'm fine.

Yeah, yeah.
I heard it a million times, cowboy.

09:58.493 --> 10:00.882
...I believe a day of reckoning
has arrived.

10:01.053 --> 10:03.726
And you just reckon you'll
toss in with the good guys?

10:04.613 --> 10:06.012

just happens to be on it.

Hmm. What are the odds?

This isn't about Fred,
or anyone else for that matter.

10:13.813 --> 10:15.883
It's about right and wrong.

10:16.053 --> 10:18.613
And you have such a clear grip
on those concepts.

10:18.773 --> 10:20.491
I've made mistakes.

10:20.653 --> 10:22.962
You're making a big one now.

10:32.453 --> 10:34.603
I could wear the glasses again.

10:34.773 --> 10:37.287

10:47.693 --> 10:50.207
Funny thing about black and white.

10:50.373 --> 10:52.329
You mix it together, and you get gray.

10:52.493 --> 10:55.565
And it doesn't matter how much
white you try and put back in...

10:55.733 --> 10:58.566
...you're never gonna
get anything but gray.

through every database...

How can a creature with that much
firepower not leave a parchment trail?

11:22.413 --> 11:23.607
There is a trail.

11:23.773 --> 11:27.288
Problem is, the trail guide
was drawn by a crackhead.

Hey, Cordelia.

- You do? Really?

Well, then, you're handling
it a lot better than me.

12:20.853 --> 12:23.413
Can we not do this right now?

12:25.213 --> 12:27.204
Listen up, daddy dearest.

12:27.373 --> 12:30.206
The fact that this hell-beast
you're looking for crawled up...

12:30.373 --> 12:33.570
...out of the ground in the exact spot
where your son was born...

12:33.773 --> 12:35.843
...seems what we should
be talking about now.

12:36.013 --> 12:38.607
The same spot? Really?

12:38.773 --> 12:40.172
You said you already knew.

12:40.333 --> 12:42.164
Of course I knew.

12:42.693 --> 12:44.649
Doesn't mean anything. It could be a...

12:44.813 --> 12:46.485
- Coincidence.
- Strange things happen.

12:46.653 --> 12:48.450
Like a vampire giving birth?

12:48.613 --> 12:50.922
Oh, wait. That happened
in the exact same spot too.

12:51.093 --> 12:52.082
What are you...?

12:53.573 --> 12:55.484
You think Connor's
connected to this thing.

12:55.653 --> 12:58.565
Me? God, no.
He's a sweetie pie.

13:00.493 --> 13:01.846
Then why are you telling me?

13:02.013 --> 13:05.528
Because your son stormed out this
morning, and he really does believe it.

13:08.213 --> 13:11.603
Listen, Frank, I don't care if you have
to LoJack the damn thing.

13:14.853 --> 13:18.892
Find that beast,
or I swear to God, I will...

13:19.053 --> 13:20.771
- "Boil you alive."
- Shut up.

13:22.613 --> 13:26.083
Boil you alive.

13:27.053 --> 13:31.012
How hard can it be to find a giant,
horned thing?

13:33.533 --> 13:35.444
Or a decent cup of coffee?

13:38.093 --> 13:39.924
Why are you still here?

Intel confirms the creature triggered
the pyrotechnics last night.

13:43.613 --> 13:45.569
They're just not sure why he did it.

13:45.733 --> 13:48.372
I'll tell you why. Because it can.

13:48.533 --> 13:52.128
It's the 800-pound gorilla.
It can do whatever the hell it wants.

13:52.293 --> 13:53.282
I get that.

13:53.453 --> 13:58.163
Other than charbroiling everything
in sight, I don't think it has an agenda...

13:58.333 --> 13:59.846
...and that makes our job tricky.

14:00.053 --> 14:01.327
What job?

14:01.493 --> 14:04.132
The senior partners want us
to try and cut a deal with it.

14:04.293 --> 14:07.603
- You can't be serious.
- It wants the same things we do:

14:07.773 --> 14:10.606
An apocalypse, end of the world,
yadda, yadda, yadda...

14:10.773 --> 14:14.561
Partners feel it might speed things along,
save a few bucks.

14:14.733 --> 14:17.884
- But what if it's not interested?
- They'll change its mind.

14:18.053 --> 14:19.486
I'm not losing this one.

14:34.093 --> 14:35.492
I have questions.

14:36.893 --> 14:39.009
Connor.

14:39.173 --> 14:42.848
The last few hours
haven't brought enough surprises.

14:43.013 --> 14:45.004
You really threw us
for a loop here, kiddo.

14:45.173 --> 14:47.641
Sneaking in the building.

14:47.813 --> 14:49.883
You really are like
your old man, aren't you?

14:50.053 --> 14:52.362
It's time to find out.

14:52.533 --> 14:54.524
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

14:54.693 --> 14:58.686
I want to know why I'm here.
What I am.

14:59.773 --> 15:01.252
A timeless question.

15:01.413 --> 15:03.483
And one we're more
than happy to help answer.

15:03.653 --> 15:06.884
We have an in-house lab.
We'll do a few easy workups.

15:07.053 --> 15:10.090
Psychological, physiological,
neurological...

15:10.253 --> 15:14.087
...and focus on exactly
who or what you are.

15:15.293 --> 15:19.252
Then we'll slice you open
and start poking around.

15:22.493 --> 15:25.883
- I got a different idea.
- I'm open to any suggestions.

15:26.093 --> 15:29.563
That demon you're seeking,
I think I'm connected to it.

15:29.733 --> 15:32.770
- I want to find out how.
- Sure. No problem.

15:32.933 --> 15:35.925
Gavin, why don't you get our young
friend a copy of your report?

15:36.093 --> 15:40.006

36:40.213 --> 36:42.647
- You've seen her?
- Once when I was trying to find you.

36:42.813 --> 36:44.212
She might be able to help us.

36:44.413 --> 36:48.201
So fight seven floors of evil lawyer
zombies or sweet-talk a nasty little girl.

36:48.373 --> 36:51.206
- You know where my heart's at.
- Yeah. I gotta disagree.

36:51.373 --> 36:53.284
I say the white room.
How do we get there?

36:53.493 --> 36:55.290
Gonna need your help.

37:13.133 --> 37:15.408
Do what you can.

37:25.373 --> 37:29.252
ANGEL: Fred?
- Working on it! Come on, Fred, think.

37:29.453 --> 37:32.365
Bypass switch
for a shutdown command.

37:33.853 --> 37:34.922
ANGEL:
Come on, Fred!

37:37.173 --> 37:39.050
Angel!

37:39.253 --> 37:40.971
ANGEL:
Guys, let's go!

37:42.573 --> 37:44.689
- Remember the code?
- Photographic memory.

37:54.133 --> 37:55.964
- What?
- Maybe you forgot.

37:56.173 --> 37:57.811
I didn't forget.
Let me try again.

37:58.013 --> 37:59.571
GUNN:
That's Gavin. I know that guy.

38:01.733 --> 38:04.486
Hold up.

38:04.693 --> 38:06.604
Hate seeing someone I know like that.

38:06.813 --> 38:08.212
Even someone I know I hate.

38:09.093 --> 38:11.323
No time like the present, Angel.

38:17.373 --> 38:20.251
Here's hoping she's in a good mood.

38:31.893 --> 38:33.485
FRED:
Oh, no.

38:35.733 --> 38:39.089
- It was waiting for us all along.
- No, I don't think so.

38:40.213 --> 38:43.410
It wanted this. The girl.

38:43.573 --> 38:45.803
Whatever she is, it came for her.

38:47.693 --> 38:49.411
Is there a way out of here?

38:54.293 --> 38:57.285
The answer is among you.

39:29.693 --> 39:31.684
[CHANTING]

39:49.533 --> 39:51.251
Home.

39:52.973 --> 39:54.929
She sent us.

39:57.453 --> 39:58.647
Oh.

39:58.813 --> 40:00.326
Dad?

40:08.253 --> 40:09.527
You're safe.

40:15.133 --> 40:16.930
FRED: Does it still hurt?
GUNN: It's okay.

40:17.093 --> 40:20.847
Well, hail the conquering heroes.
And how the hell did you just do that?

40:21.013 --> 40:23.652
That was awful,
what it did to that little girl.

40:23.813 --> 40:25.724
Oh, it killed a girl?

40:25.893 --> 40:27.485
Not really a girl.

40:27.653 --> 40:30.645
Something ancient and evil
dressed like a girl.

40:30.813 --> 40:33.805
What's it say about the Big Bad Wolf
if he can stride right in...

40:33.973 --> 40:36.407
...and suck the energy
out of evil Red Riding Hood?

40:36.613 --> 40:37.728
I don't know.

40:37.893 --> 40:42.045
Other than it'll take a force far smarter
and stronger than us to defeat it.

40:42.253 --> 40:45.086
Oh, like there's a lot of that
just lying around.

40:57.853 --> 40:59.172
Hey.

40:59.533 --> 41:01.125
I was...

41:03.053 --> 41:05.248
...really worried.

41:06.133 --> 41:07.452
I bet.

41:09.533 --> 41:13.731
The folks out there
are feeling pretty discouraged.

41:13.893 --> 41:15.565
Yep.

41:16.813 --> 41:21.648
I'm just glad that everyone's
safe and together again.

41:21.853 --> 41:23.764
- Me too.
- Yeah.

41:23.933 --> 41:26.845
Now, take your new boyfriend...

41:27.013 --> 41:29.447
...and get the hell out of here.

41:35.933 --> 41:37.685
Oh, God.
