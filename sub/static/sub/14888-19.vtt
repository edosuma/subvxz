Hi, baby.
Have you seen Lydia?

01:30.557 --> 01:33.126
Yeah, she just wandered
into the archives.

01:33.159 --> 01:34.360
I hate to see her
wandering around

01:34.394 --> 01:35.562
in the condition she's in.

01:35.596 --> 01:36.630
Yeah, I heard.

01:36.663 --> 01:38.198
Frank dumped her?

01:38.231 --> 01:39.666
Frank?
That was last week.

01:39.700 --> 01:43.236
Norman dumped her
this morning.

01:43.269 --> 01:46.873
Boy, she has more trouble
picking men than George Bush.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.583
(Larry)
Uh, Lydia.

01:56.617 --> 01:59.252
I heard about Frank..

01:59.285 --> 02:00.621
...and Norman.

02:03.489 --> 02:05.458
I know it's been a rough week
for you. Are you okay?

02:05.491 --> 02:08.695
Oh, I'm fine!

02:08.729 --> 02:11.598
I don't know why everybody's
so upset about this.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.834
Men are like buses

02:13.867 --> 02:16.870
if you miss one there'll be
another one around in a minute.

02:19.472 --> 02:21.274
Three, two, one.

02:21.307 --> 02:23.043
[crying]

02:26.913 --> 02:28.715
I've been through this
with her before.

02:32.418 --> 02:34.855
Cousin, I did it!

02:34.888 --> 02:38.358
I figured out a way to make
Miss Lydia feel better.

02:38.391 --> 02:40.360
Did you get her flowers?

02:40.393 --> 02:41.595
That's cute.

02:43.530 --> 02:45.899
Cousin, flowers are nice but..

02:45.932 --> 02:47.768
...they don't keep you
warm at night.

02:49.636 --> 02:51.505
I got her a man.

02:55.976 --> 02:58.579
Whoa, wait a minute!
Wait a minute! No, no.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.480
No, n‐no, n‐no,
no, no, no, no, no.

03:00.514 --> 03:03.650
Balki, finding Lydia a man
is none of your business.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.218
Well, technically,
that's true.

03:05.251 --> 03:08.354
Matchmaking is actually
my mama's business.

03:08.388 --> 03:10.924
But, I used to do her books.

03:13.994 --> 03:15.962
‐ Your mama was a matchmaker?
‐ Still is.

03:15.996 --> 03:18.665
For six generations
Mypos has depended

03:18.699 --> 03:21.367
on the Bartokomous family
for matchmaking.

03:21.401 --> 03:23.770
In fact, our house
was fondly referred

03:23.804 --> 03:25.839
to as the love connection.

03:27.674 --> 03:29.643
W‐well, who is this guy?

03:29.676 --> 03:31.444
It's not somebody you just
met on the street, is it?

03:31.477 --> 03:34.548
Well, of course not!
Don't be ridiculous!

03:34.581 --> 03:36.416
I met him across the street
in the diner.

03:38.552 --> 03:42.255
His name is Jack Colby and he's
coming over later this afternoon

03:42.288 --> 03:45.258
just to meet, just to talk,
just to have a look‐see.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.362
Thanks, Harriette,
I'm alright now.

03:49.395 --> 03:50.731
Bye, boys!
Have a nice weekend!

03:50.764 --> 03:53.333
Wait a minute! Lydia!
Lydia, you can't leave now!

03:53.366 --> 03:55.435
I have found the perfect man
for you.

03:55.468 --> 03:59.940
Eh, his, his name is Jack
and, uh, he's tall

03:59.973 --> 04:01.908
he's good‐looking,
and get this

04:01.942 --> 04:03.877
he don't spit when he talks.

04:05.646 --> 04:08.448
Lydia, I'm afraid Balki has been
playing matchmaker for you

04:08.481 --> 04:10.050
I tried to tell him
it was a mistake.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.084
Oh, Balki.

04:11.117 --> 04:13.954
Well, I appreciate what
you're doing but, you know

04:13.987 --> 04:17.290
I've been thinking,
I'm doing okay.

04:17.322 --> 04:19.926
I've got friends, a nationally
syndicated column

04:19.959 --> 04:23.897
I have a little money...okay,
I've got a ton of money.

04:23.930 --> 04:26.800
The last thing I need
in my life is a man.

04:28.034 --> 04:29.536
‐ Balki!
‐ Jack!

04:29.570 --> 04:30.804
Hi, how are you?

04:30.837 --> 04:32.539
‐ Good, good.
‐ Good.

04:32.573 --> 04:36.409
Now, now, Jack, uh, this is
the Lydia that I told you about.

04:36.442 --> 04:38.712
And Lydia, this is the Jack
that I told you about.

04:42.649 --> 04:44.585
You're Lydia?

04:44.618 --> 04:47.087
You're not at all
what I expected.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.022
You see, I read your column
every single day and

04:49.055 --> 04:51.525
and the advice you give
your readers is so wise

04:51.558 --> 04:55.461
so obviously born
from experience..

04:55.495 --> 04:57.564
...that I didn't expect
someone quite so young.

05:02.536 --> 05:03.469
You didn't?

05:05.005 --> 05:06.840
Listen, Jack, I'm sorry
if Balki's caused you

05:06.873 --> 05:08.374
any inconvenience,
but Lydia's decided‐‐

05:08.408 --> 05:09.676
Shut up, Larry.

05:11.545 --> 05:12.813
So, you read my column?

05:12.846 --> 05:14.781
Yes, everyday.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.551
Now I hope this doesn't
sound forward but..

05:17.584 --> 05:19.620
...would you have dinner
with me later?

05:19.653 --> 05:22.523
Oh, well, well, why wait?

05:22.556 --> 05:24.024
I haven't eaten
anything all day

05:24.057 --> 05:27.093
due to a minor trauma
in my life.

05:27.127 --> 05:28.762
I'm starved!

05:28.795 --> 05:30.363
Bye, boys!

05:30.396 --> 05:31.998
Now, uh, Jack I want to know
everything about you..

05:33.534 --> 05:35.569
[sighing]

05:35.602 --> 05:37.904
Well, another Bartokomous match.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.873
Over three thousand served.

05:42.676 --> 05:46.479
This may be worth a photograph
in mama's brochure.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.649
That was amazing.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.717
Balki, you are quite
a matchmaker.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.719
So tell me something
I don't know.

05:56.723 --> 05:59.159
Was that Jack Colby with Lydia
in the parking lot?

05:59.192 --> 06:00.861
Mr. Gorpley,
you know Mr. Colby?

06:00.894 --> 06:03.029
Only by reputation.

06:03.063 --> 06:04.765
What is his reputation?

06:04.798 --> 06:06.533
Well, the guy dresses
for success

06:06.567 --> 06:08.669
but he's never worked
a day in his life.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.772
He charms women into giving him
cash, clothes and cars

06:11.805 --> 06:13.640
and then he kisses them goodbye.

06:13.674 --> 06:16.042
He's been married four times
and he's got two

06:16.076 --> 06:19.680
count 'em, two ex‐wives
paying him alimony.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.149
The man's a gigolo!

06:23.183 --> 06:25.451
Yeah. He's my hero.

06:31.858 --> 06:33.960
Oh, cousin, I've dropped
Miss Lydia

06:33.994 --> 06:36.396
in some deep babasticki.

06:46.573 --> 06:47.808
Still no answer?

06:47.841 --> 06:49.442
No, cousin, I can't believe

06:49.475 --> 06:51.678
Miss Lydia's been gone
all weekend!

06:51.712 --> 06:53.079
This is all my fault.

06:53.113 --> 06:54.915
I never should have
practiced matchmaking

06:54.948 --> 06:56.883
with only a learner's permit.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.754
Cousin, what if Jack
has already tricked her

07:00.787 --> 07:02.823
and‐and broken her heart?

07:02.856 --> 07:04.925
What if he's already tricked her
and taken all her money?

07:04.958 --> 07:06.960
Alright, Balki.
Balki, stop it. Stop it!

07:06.993 --> 07:09.462
That's enough.
Now, relax. Deep breaths!

07:13.567 --> 07:15.769
Alright, Balki.

07:15.802 --> 07:17.203
Listen, listen.

07:17.237 --> 07:19.139
Lydia's not stupid.

07:19.172 --> 07:21.007
I bet she went out
with this guy and realized

07:21.041 --> 07:22.709
right away he was
only after her money.

07:22.743 --> 07:23.577
She'll probably
come through that door

just going out to dinner.

we left here Friday

I know this is gonna hurt,
but there are a few things

08:11.625 --> 08:13.894
you should know about Jack.
Number one‐‐

08:13.927 --> 08:17.130
‐ He's been married four times.
‐ You know about that?

08:17.163 --> 08:20.100
Oh, of course I do!
He told me everything

08:20.133 --> 08:21.902
He did?

08:21.935 --> 08:25.772
Did he tell you that two of his
ex‐wives are paying him abalony?

08:28.709 --> 08:30.076
That is alimony.

08:30.110 --> 08:33.714
And he feels terrible about it.

08:33.746 --> 08:36.116

08:36.149 --> 08:37.851

to find out

what kind of
person Jack is

08:42.322 --> 08:44.858
before you get
too serious about him.

08:46.259 --> 08:49.663
We are way beyond serious.

08:49.696 --> 08:53.567

and break her heart

09:23.096 --> 09:24.831

09:27.801 --> 09:30.336

09:46.820 --> 09:48.622
Well, wait a minute, Balki.

09:48.655 --> 09:51.324
Don't do anything drastic.

09:51.357 --> 09:53.193
‐ We'll think of something.
‐ What, cousin?

09:53.226 --> 09:55.228
‐ She won't listen to reason.
‐ I know.

09:55.261 --> 09:56.963
So we'll have to show her that

09:56.997 --> 09:59.800
Jack will go after
any woman with money.

Cousin, usually your plans
are a bust but..

...tonight your bust
is the plan.

10:57.257 --> 10:59.325
Where do I come up with them?

11:03.429 --> 11:04.798
This wasn't my plan.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.967
My plan was for you
to be the woman.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.937
Well, cousin, we have
to convince Lydia

11:10.971 --> 11:14.875
that Jack is only after
her money, not her body.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.442
And I think
we both agreed that

11:16.476 --> 11:19.245
I looked a little bit
too much like Sophia Loren.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.949
Come on, let's go.

11:26.486 --> 11:28.822
I told you to wear flats.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.456
Flats with a dress
like this?

11:30.490 --> 11:32.425
I don't think so.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.301
Now, come on.
Dance me over to Jack.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.937
Is that when you're gonna
put the moves on him?

11:43.970 --> 11:46.206
No, I'm not gonna put
the moves on him.

11:46.239 --> 11:48.474
I‐I'm just going
to drop subtle hints

11:48.509 --> 11:51.411

isn't feeling well

12:27.447 --> 12:29.983

was visiting

aunt to come.

hotels and casinos.

13:03.316 --> 13:07.053
Aunt Desi's late
and very dead husband..

13:09.322 --> 13:11.958
...was also a very
successful shipping maggot.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.600
‐ Excuse me?
‐ Magnate.

13:19.633 --> 13:22.135
Shipping magnate.
Magnate!

13:24.204 --> 13:25.305
Fascinating.

13:25.338 --> 13:27.240
Uh, sweetheart,
we mustn't ignore

13:27.273 --> 13:28.909
our other guests,
so excuse me.

13:28.942 --> 13:29.976
Well, certainly.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.945
‐ Bye‐bye Lydia.
‐ Bye.

13:33.947 --> 13:36.950
Cousin, you're dyin'
over here.

13:36.983 --> 13:39.019
I think you got to dump
the Bea Arthur look

13:39.052 --> 13:42.923
and...maybe show
a little thigh.

13:42.956 --> 13:44.925
Forget it.

13:44.958 --> 13:46.059
I only shaved to the knee.

13:51.197 --> 13:52.398
Nice party, huh?

13:52.432 --> 13:53.967
Yes, it's delightful.

13:55.969 --> 13:57.237
Larry?

13:59.005 --> 14:01.374
‐ Harriette, I can explain this.
‐ Hey!

14:01.407 --> 14:03.877
I don't know what you're doin'
and I don't wanna know.

14:07.981 --> 14:10.651
Cousin, this chocolate mouse
is to die for!

14:10.684 --> 14:13.219
‐ You've got to try it!
‐ No, I can't, Balki.

14:13.253 --> 14:16.056
Not if I want to
stay a size ten.

14:16.089 --> 14:17.524
Well, hello again.

14:17.558 --> 14:20.961
Oh, Jack!
Oh, look, it's Jack.

14:20.994 --> 14:22.963
So, uh, Desiree, how long
are you in town for?

14:22.996 --> 14:24.130
‐ A week.
‐ A month.

14:24.164 --> 14:26.199
A week and a month.

14:26.232 --> 14:27.634
Five weeks altogether.

14:27.668 --> 14:31.004
Then I'm off to the far east.
China, Japan, Tibet..

14:31.037 --> 14:33.239
Oh, Aunt Desi loves to bet.

14:33.273 --> 14:36.342
She must go to Vegas five,
six times a year.

14:38.078 --> 14:39.613
In fact, she loves Vegas
so much

14:39.646 --> 14:40.681
she's thinking of buying it!

14:40.714 --> 14:41.948
Balki.

14:41.982 --> 14:42.916
But, before she does that

14:42.949 --> 14:45.586
she's got to think about
selling Atlantic City.

14:45.619 --> 14:47.554
You know there was this one time
where we were talking about..

14:49.556 --> 14:51.525
Would you get me
a glass of water?

14:51.558 --> 14:53.459
Well, sure, you can have mine,
I haven't touched it.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.028
Where was I?

14:55.061 --> 14:56.597
Oh, there was an interesting
moment once when she..

14:58.532 --> 15:00.333
Would you get me
a glass of water..

15:00.366 --> 15:02.035
...from a well?

15:08.474 --> 15:10.644
Oh! Right, right.

15:10.677 --> 15:13.279
Aunt Desi loves
her well water

15:13.313 --> 15:15.148
and well she should.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.558
Where does he come up
with them?

15:26.492 --> 15:27.994
Hors d'ouvres?

15:28.028 --> 15:29.563
Well, yes, of course.
Thank you.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.434
You'll‐you'll have
to forgive Balki.

15:34.467 --> 15:37.070
Well, he's a, he's a dear
really but, uh..

15:37.103 --> 15:39.272
...he's a little awkward
around me.

15:39.305 --> 15:42.743
Probably because I'm so
unbelievably wealthy.

15:42.776 --> 15:45.145
Well, you're
very fortunate that

15:45.178 --> 15:48.114
your husband left you
so well taken care of.

15:48.148 --> 15:50.116
I suppose so.

15:50.150 --> 15:55.188
But I think Lydia's the
fortunate one...she has you.

15:55.221 --> 15:57.123
Well, thank you.

15:57.157 --> 16:00.761
Well, I didn't mean
to embarrass you.

16:00.794 --> 16:04.030
It's just that, you know,
I've always thought if I..

16:04.064 --> 16:08.468
...if I found the right person
my life would be perfect.

16:08.502 --> 16:12.005
Someone to whisper sweet
nothings in my ear

16:12.038 --> 16:14.474
to exchange
a knowing glance with.

16:17.644 --> 16:21.081
Someone to walk
hand in hand through the..

16:21.114 --> 16:23.717
...many shopping centers
and retail outlets I own.

16:32.225 --> 16:33.694
I hope you find what
you're looking for.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.129
Excuse me.

16:45.305 --> 16:47.040
What's a woman gotta do?

17:00.621 --> 17:03.524
‐ Desiree!
‐ Oh! Oh, Jack!

17:03.557 --> 17:06.291
Desiree, I can't stand it any
longer! I can't resist you!

17:06.326 --> 17:08.729
Oh, Jack, what on earth
are you talking about?

17:08.762 --> 17:10.329
I'm talking about us!

17:10.363 --> 17:12.665
When you walked through
that door I felt something.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.836
And just hearing you talk about
whispering sweet nothings

17:15.868 --> 17:17.538
knowing glances
and taking long walks

17:17.570 --> 17:20.641
I realized that you
were whispering to me

17:20.674 --> 17:23.276
and glancing at me,
and walking with me.

17:24.678 --> 17:26.613
Sweetheart.

17:26.646 --> 17:28.515
‐ Oh, Jack.
‐ Yes.

17:28.549 --> 17:31.317
You can't imagine how much
I was hoping you'd say that.

17:33.787 --> 17:37.323
Sweetheart, let's run away
tonight and get married.

17:37.357 --> 17:40.193
No! No! No, no.

17:40.226 --> 17:41.795
‐ Well, what about Lydia?
‐ Who?

17:41.828 --> 17:42.863
Lydia.

17:42.896 --> 17:44.765
Oh, her.
Forget her.

17:44.798 --> 17:46.399
She's a child.
You're a woman!

17:46.432 --> 17:49.703
No! No!
No, no.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.405
First, you have to tell Lydia.

17:52.438 --> 17:54.140
We can't begin our life
together until

17:54.174 --> 17:56.276
I'm sure it's over
between you two.

17:56.309 --> 17:59.780
‐ I'll phone her from Vegas.
‐ No! No, no.

18:02.415 --> 18:05.686
You have to tell her now!

18:10.156 --> 18:11.291
Of course.

18:17.363 --> 18:18.665
[sighing]
Ho.

18:29.510 --> 18:30.577
(Balki)
Cousin?

18:32.312 --> 18:33.714
It's working!

18:39.520 --> 18:41.154
Cousin, that's great!

18:41.187 --> 18:42.322
Jack took the bait.

18:42.355 --> 18:45.592
Oh! Now reel him in
and hit him with an oar!

18:49.530 --> 18:52.265
That's how we fish on Mypos.

18:52.298 --> 18:54.500
Oh, Jack! There you are.

18:54.535 --> 18:56.202
Um, attention, everyone!

18:56.236 --> 18:58.204
Jack and I have
an announcement to make.

18:58.238 --> 18:59.472
Tell them, Jack.

18:59.506 --> 19:03.209
Jack...be gentle.

19:03.243 --> 19:04.578
I will.

19:06.346 --> 19:07.881
Lydia, you're history.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.652
I'm marrying somebody else.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.522
What is this?

19:15.556 --> 19:16.823
Dump Lydia Month?

19:17.891 --> 19:19.025
Yes, I thought that I loved you

19:19.059 --> 19:21.928
but then I met Desiree and
I discovered what real love is.

19:22.596 --> 19:24.330
Desiree?

19:24.364 --> 19:25.331
This Desiree?

19:25.365 --> 19:27.333
Hey, stuff happens!

19:34.274 --> 19:36.810
You're leaving me for
a woman you just met?

19:36.843 --> 19:37.844
No, Miss Lydia.

19:37.878 --> 19:40.581
He's leaving you for
a man he just met!

19:45.852 --> 19:47.788
No problem.

19:47.821 --> 19:50.957
We'll find the best psychiatrist
that money can buy.

19:50.991 --> 19:52.959
‐ I have no money.
‐ No money?

19:54.561 --> 19:57.463
Lydia, the wedding's back on!

19:57.497 --> 19:58.599
Let's make our announcement.

19:58.632 --> 20:01.902
Just one minute,
you Jell‐O mold.

20:01.935 --> 20:03.269
Gigolo.

20:04.638 --> 20:05.939
You Goldfinger!

20:05.972 --> 20:06.873
Gold digger.

20:08.675 --> 20:10.977
You old‐timer!

20:11.011 --> 20:12.345
Two‐timer.

20:13.279 --> 20:14.681
You wanna do this?

20:14.715 --> 20:16.683
No, no, no, you go ahead.
You're doing fine. Go ahead

20:18.619 --> 20:21.321
Just who do you
think you are?

20:21.354 --> 20:23.389
Some kind of
Don Juan Johnson?

20:26.593 --> 20:28.962
Well, I have a hot
flash dance for you.

20:30.931 --> 20:34.635
Miss Lydia's been dumped
by better men than you..

20:34.668 --> 20:36.402
...and that was
just this week!

20:41.341 --> 20:46.547
She is a wonderful person
and a snappy little dresser..

20:46.580 --> 20:51.952
...and you are not worthy to
spit on the ground she walks on.

20:51.985 --> 20:54.588
So hit the road, Jack!

20:55.889 --> 20:58.625
And I mean maybe!

21:03.530 --> 21:05.031
Do you want me to go?

21:05.065 --> 21:07.000
Not just yet.

21:20.446 --> 21:22.382
Now you can go.

21:22.415 --> 21:23.950
[people cheering]

21:28.522 --> 21:30.356
Miss Lydia, are you alright?

21:30.390 --> 21:32.325
Oh, I'm fine.

21:32.358 --> 21:33.827
No big deal.

21:33.860 --> 21:36.963
Men are like freeway exits.

21:36.997 --> 21:39.766
If you miss one, there's
another one down the road.

21:41.902 --> 21:44.871
Oh, please, everyone!
Don't let this spoil the party!

21:44.905 --> 21:47.574
Eat! Drink! Be merry!

21:49.375 --> 21:51.945
Three, two, one.

21:51.978 --> 21:53.714
[crying]

22:05.491 --> 22:06.627
What a night!

22:07.661 --> 22:09.095
Boy, I'll say.

22:09.129 --> 22:12.799
Cousin, Miss Lydia's lucky
to have a friend like you.

22:12.833 --> 22:14.467
By the end of the evening,
you had her

22:14.500 --> 22:17.504
laughing out of
the palm of your hand.

22:19.706 --> 22:22.442
Well, I hope you
learned your lesson!

22:22.475 --> 22:24.077
Why, cousin, I did!

22:24.110 --> 22:25.579
Oh, I did!

22:26.513 --> 22:27.714
Thank you, cousin.

22:28.849 --> 22:30.016
[knocking on door]

22:30.050 --> 22:31.718
Come in.

22:32.719 --> 22:33.754
Hi, Larry, I was
just wondering

22:33.787 --> 22:35.722
if you wanted to go
get some coffee.

22:45.098 --> 22:46.967
I‐I should have called first.

22:50.003 --> 22:52.739
[instrumental music]

22:59.179 --> 23:01.381
[theme music]
