WEBVTT

00:02.659 --> 00:04.392
Last spring,
I knelt, as I do now,

00:04.394 --> 00:05.826
and altered
both of our lives forever.

00:05.828 --> 00:08.829
And ever since then,
I'm sure you've been wondering

00:08.831 --> 00:11.064
when I was gonna make
this part official.

00:11.066 --> 00:12.999
Nicholas Miller,

00:13.001 --> 00:15.467
will you do me the honor
of being my best man?

00:17.003 --> 00:19.069
(groans) Oh, hey.

00:19.071 --> 00:21.071
I'm glad you're up. I've got
something important to ask you.

00:21.073 --> 00:22.105
I'm ready.

00:22.107 --> 00:24.207
Would you...

00:24.209 --> 00:26.042
Hold on a second. I need coffee.

00:26.044 --> 00:27.043
Here's one.

00:27.045 --> 00:28.277
Aw.

00:28.279 --> 00:30.345
Thanks.

00:32.282 --> 00:33.481
Mmm.

00:34.717 --> 00:35.982
Mmm.

00:39.787 --> 00:42.454
This just all feels
so sudden that, uh...

00:42.456 --> 00:44.689
I don't know what to say.
Just say yes.

00:44.691 --> 00:46.290
Well, I want to say yes.

00:46.292 --> 00:47.624
I really do.

00:47.626 --> 00:50.727
But I'm sorry.

00:50.729 --> 00:52.128
I'm just not there.

00:52.130 --> 00:54.797
I think that
you are there.

00:54.799 --> 00:57.132
But I think it scares
the hell out of you.

00:57.134 --> 00:59.234
I wish that were the case.
I just...

00:59.236 --> 01:03.237
In my heart, I don't know
if I'm your best man.

01:03.239 --> 01:06.907
Nick... I need you
to get there.

01:06.909 --> 01:09.109
(sighs) Do you want to be
my maid of honor?

01:09.111 --> 01:12.579
Yes! Yes, yes,
yes, yes! (laughs)

01:12.581 --> 01:14.714
Blindsided?! How the heck
you gonna feel blindsided?!

01:14.716 --> 01:16.582
We've been best friends
ever since college!

01:16.584 --> 01:17.382
(snickers)

01:17.384 --> 01:18.383
Are you snickering?

01:18.385 --> 01:20.785
Za-zam! (laughs)

01:20.787 --> 01:21.719
(laughs)
Was it worth it?

01:21.721 --> 01:22.953
Oh, it was worth it.

01:22.955 --> 01:23.954
Would've paid double.

01:23.956 --> 01:25.588
(laughs)

01:25.590 --> 01:27.823
All right, get up.

01:27.825 --> 01:29.424
You stupid bastard.

01:29.426 --> 01:31.325
Come here. Of course
I'll be your best man!

01:31.327 --> 01:32.592
All right!

01:32.594 --> 01:36.429
These rings
are the first

01:36.431 --> 01:39.565
of a dozen accessories that are
gonna unify the bridal party.

01:39.567 --> 01:42.134
As you can see from
my preliminary vision board,

01:42.136 --> 01:44.636
our wedding will borrow
equally from the holy trinity

01:44.638 --> 01:47.639
of Liz Taylor, Jackie O
and The Power Gays.

01:47.641 --> 01:49.607
Oh, I'm scared.
You should be.

01:49.609 --> 01:50.808
Guys, look at us.

01:50.810 --> 01:52.009
A year ago,
we were spinning

01:52.011 --> 01:54.144
around like cows
in the movie<i> Twister.</i>

01:54.146 --> 01:55.145
Now look at us.

01:55.147 --> 01:56.246
You guys are engaged.

01:56.248 --> 01:57.080
You're a minority owner

01:57.082 --> 01:58.281
of the bar.

01:58.283 --> 01:59.448
I'm the maid
of honor

01:59.450 --> 02:00.682
who's made of honor.

02:00.684 --> 02:02.250
That joke works better on paper.

02:02.252 --> 02:03.150
Yeah, probably.

02:03.152 --> 02:04.084
And this guy...

02:04.953 --> 02:06.152
...is the cop

02:06.154 --> 02:07.786
who freaking
saved a freaking

02:07.788 --> 02:09.120
kid's life.

02:09.122 --> 02:10.287
Help!

02:10.289 --> 02:11.588
I'm stuck!
Hey!

02:11.590 --> 02:12.855
(grunting)

02:13.357 --> 02:14.589
Help!

02:14.591 --> 02:15.957
(shouts)

02:15.959 --> 02:17.825
(panting)

02:17.827 --> 02:19.993
Thanks, Officer.

02:19.995 --> 02:21.094
Call an ambulance.

02:21.096 --> 02:22.161
I feel fine.

02:22.163 --> 02:23.328
For me!

02:23.330 --> 02:24.762
(chuckles)
You know, Channel 4

02:24.764 --> 02:26.430
is calling me
the Carport Hero.

02:26.432 --> 02:28.965
I just... I just
really hope it sticks.

02:28.967 --> 02:30.366
It's not a big deal.

02:30.368 --> 02:32.801
This is... our year.

02:32.803 --> 02:36.637
The Chinese zodiac says
it's the Year of the Monkey.

02:36.639 --> 02:39.206
I say it's the Year of...

SCHMIDT:<i> Thanks so much</i>
<i> for your help, Jess.</i>

03:00.625 --> 03:02.458
(chuckles)
Cece has zero idea

03:02.460 --> 03:03.459
that you're flying her mother in

03:03.461 --> 03:04.726
for the engagement party
tonight.

03:04.728 --> 03:06.728
She is... she is
alarmingly in the dark.

03:06.730 --> 03:08.396
Maybe it's a cultural thing.

03:08.398 --> 03:11.298
You know, we saw the British
coming. India did not.

03:11.300 --> 03:13.133
Are you nervous to
meet Cece's mom?  No.

03:13.135 --> 03:15.368
Cece said her mom is
really excited that her

03:15.370 --> 03:19.371
sexy little bronco has finally
met a cowboy that can tame her.

03:19.373 --> 03:21.239
Paraphrasing. And
I'm really excited

03:21.241 --> 03:23.241
to meet the woman
that Cece came out of.

03:23.243 --> 03:24.809
Not paraphrasing.

03:24.811 --> 03:25.910
I like your confidence.

03:25.912 --> 03:28.345
Meeting Big Mama P is huge.

03:28.347 --> 03:30.647
Her approval means
everything to Cece.

03:30.649 --> 03:31.814
Mom,

03:31.816 --> 03:33.715
this is my new friend, Jess.

03:41.757 --> 03:44.057
20-minute playdate.

03:44.059 --> 03:45.825
(both squealing)

03:45.827 --> 03:48.027
Secretly, she's a romantic,

03:48.029 --> 03:50.262
'cause she used to be
a Bollywood dancer

03:50.264 --> 03:52.030
and Mr. P's parents

03:52.032 --> 03:53.431
forbid them from marrying.

03:53.433 --> 03:55.433
Hot. Continue.

03:55.435 --> 03:57.768
When they saw her perform,
they were so moved,

03:57.770 --> 03:59.269
they gave their blessing.

03:59.271 --> 04:01.070
Dance can be so
powerful sometimes.

04:01.072 --> 04:03.238
Ugh, don't I know it.
That's why I booked

04:03.240 --> 04:05.740
L.A.'s premier
Bollywood dance troupe,

04:05.742 --> 04:07.842
MaHotMoves Gandhi.

04:07.844 --> 04:08.909
MaHotMoves Gandhi.

04:08.911 --> 04:11.011
She's gonna love you. I gotcha.

04:11.013 --> 04:12.846
Okay. I'm gonna go
check on the best man.

04:12.848 --> 04:15.014
I'm sure he's handling
whatever task you gave him

04:15.016 --> 04:16.414
just fine.

04:18.951 --> 04:22.852
(both laugh)

04:22.854 --> 04:24.787
He's so bad at everything!

04:24.789 --> 04:28.023
Look, he's just one of those
rare heterosexual men

04:28.025 --> 04:30.091
who does not have a knack
for wedding planning.

04:30.093 --> 04:32.126
I'll never understand
men like that.

04:32.128 --> 04:34.895
I can't pick up Cece's
mom from the airport!

04:34.897 --> 04:36.429
It's too much pressure.

04:36.431 --> 04:38.931
You said I only had to do
the easy best man stuff.

04:38.933 --> 04:41.366
You're picking someone up
from the airport in a car.

04:41.368 --> 04:43.735
Not outer space in a canoe.
It is easy, Nick.

04:43.737 --> 04:45.603
Then why don't you do it?
I can't pick her up.

04:45.605 --> 04:47.237
Tonight is one of
the most important nights

04:47.239 --> 04:49.906
of my hair's life,
and I need a shampoo.

04:49.908 --> 04:51.807
Not a cut.
They'll try and cut it,

04:51.809 --> 04:53.208
but I won't let them.

04:53.210 --> 04:54.742
Getting a day-of cut
would be insane.

04:54.744 --> 04:56.744
Unless, of course, Julian's working.
(sighs)

04:56.746 --> 04:58.812
Julian won't be
working though.

04:58.814 --> 05:00.280
You keep fireworks in your car?

05:00.282 --> 05:01.481
What are you,
a little Chinese boy?

05:01.483 --> 05:03.950

from anyone else.

05:14.460 --> 05:15.725

Officer Bishop,

05:15.727 --> 05:18.828
it is an honor to live
in your building, sir.

05:20.164 --> 05:22.264

Glen hates everybody.

Glen flips off kids. WINSTON:
Guys, look, quit it, okay?

05:26.836 --> 05:28.836
Ever since I became
the Carport Hero,

05:28.838 --> 05:30.838
you're treating me
like I'm special, and I'm not.

05:30.840 --> 05:33.841
It's me. Winnie the Bish!
The Bish with the wish!

05:33.843 --> 05:36.944
And my wish is to have fun!
Which is exactly why

05:36.946 --> 05:39.179
I'm not gonna confiscate
the fireworks behind your back.

05:39.181 --> 05:40.780
Yeah, you got me,
Officer Bishop.

05:40.782 --> 05:42.515
You can have it.

05:42.517 --> 05:45.985
I also want you to
have this Jesus wig.

05:45.987 --> 05:47.486
You know, wigs aren't illegal.
I know.

05:47.488 --> 05:48.854
But I think it would
look awesome on you.

05:48.856 --> 05:49.855
So do I.
Put it on.

05:49.857 --> 05:52.290
Fine.

05:52.292 --> 05:55.192
Whoa. Whoa!
Whoa. Whoa!

05:55.194 --> 05:58.028
Beautiful! Whoa, Winston,
you look so handsome.

at the airport.

Did you... did you fly
her in for the party?

06:23.950 --> 06:25.716
Yes.
Oh.

06:25.718 --> 06:28.719
Yeah, I did. It was supposed
to be a surprise, but...

I was even on time.

Oh, she's there. Put her on.

06:40.228 --> 06:41.994
Really?
You can speak with her? How?

06:41.996 --> 06:43.161
What are you talking about?
No, Jess,

06:43.163 --> 06:44.695
I-I need to talk
to you now.

06:44.697 --> 06:46.396
Um, okay. I got to go.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.666

windows down or the AC?

06:50.668 --> 06:53.301
Wow, you look
just like Cece!

06:53.303 --> 06:55.369

maybe you should have told your
mom you were getting married.

she is not gonna like Schmidt.

give us her blessing...

Oh, she'll love him

Schmidt is not exactly
what my mom had imagined for me.

08:13.961 --> 08:16.460

someone maybe not so...

Remember when
the power went out,

08:23.133 --> 08:25.633
and we put him in the window
to keep the planes away?

08:25.635 --> 08:28.268
What is Schmidt gonna think
when he finds out?

08:28.270 --> 08:32.038
We are gonna get her blessing,

08:36.576 --> 08:39.176
And with that, I rise.

08:44.149 --> 08:46.616
Honey, you're not... You just
need to... Yeah, relax. Okay.

08:46.618 --> 08:47.883
You definitely can't
go to this party.

08:47.885 --> 08:49.551
(sighs)
I got to go and tell him.

08:49.553 --> 08:51.052
I got to go tell him
before she gets there.

08:51.054 --> 08:52.987
I'll call Nick,
and I'll have him stall her.

08:52.989 --> 08:54.488
Okay.

08:54.490 --> 08:56.723
I don't think I can.
You have no idea

08:56.725 --> 08:58.825
how anxious this woman
is to get to the party.

08:58.827 --> 09:01.294
No, no, no, I told you,
we're not there yet.

09:01.296 --> 09:02.762
You got to stay
plugged in.

09:02.764 --> 09:04.263
You're such a pill.

09:04.265 --> 09:07.099
Well, just take her to the mall,
get her some soft serve.

09:07.101 --> 09:08.467
Be sure to save your receipts.

09:08.469 --> 09:10.101
I'll reimburse you
from the party fund.

09:10.103 --> 09:11.836
Got to go.
Ugh!

09:11.838 --> 09:16.073
Mrs. Parikh, can
you keep a secret?

09:16.075 --> 09:19.276
I'm going to kill this
soft serve nonsense.

09:19.278 --> 09:20.977
(whimpers) You know
what we're gonna do?

09:20.979 --> 09:22.244
We're gonna play  laser tag!
(screaming)

09:22.246 --> 09:23.645
(shouting in Hindi)
What are you doing?!

09:23.647 --> 09:25.079
We're gonna
play laser tag!

09:25.081 --> 09:27.581
It's a fun American game!
It's a fun game!

09:27.583 --> 09:29.583
BOTH: Groomsmen! Yeah.
(whoops)

09:29.585 --> 09:31.518
Mmm.

09:31.520 --> 09:33.686
Ah. Love each and every one
of you sons of bitches.

09:33.688 --> 09:35.854
Now, who are you?
I'm Groomsman Number Two.

09:35.856 --> 09:38.656
(chuckles) Big Schmidt,
Schmidt's cousin.

09:38.658 --> 09:40.924
I'm Robby,
Groomsman Number Four.

09:40.926 --> 09:42.358
I am the ex-boyfriend
of the bride,

09:42.360 --> 09:45.260
and a weirdly close friend
of the groom.

09:45.262 --> 09:48.429
I'm Number Five,
J. Cronkite Valley-Forge.

09:48.431 --> 09:49.530
CFO of

09:49.532 --> 09:51.431
Associated Strategies, LLC.

09:51.433 --> 09:54.100
I'm 62 years of age,
was recently widowed,

09:54.102 --> 09:55.768
and I believe earnestly

09:55.770 --> 09:58.270
that if we can all work together
this wedding season,

09:58.272 --> 10:01.706
we will get more boom-boom
than a TNT factory.

10:01.708 --> 10:02.940
Yeah!
(men laughing)

10:02.942 --> 10:05.842
Thank you for your time.
Thank you for your time.

10:05.844 --> 10:07.310
I have a brief
statement from G3,

10:07.312 --> 10:09.045
who could not make
it here tonight.

10:09.047 --> 10:12.048
It says, "Dear Jess, I can't
fly in for every damn party.

10:12.050 --> 10:13.549
"I will see you at...

10:13.551 --> 10:15.050
(imitates Coach):
the wedding."

10:15.052 --> 10:16.818
If you know Coach,
that's exactly how he...

10:16.820 --> 10:18.219
"Wedding."
Yeah, yeah.

10:18.221 --> 10:19.620
And then he always
goes, "Coach."

10:19.622 --> 10:21.021
(laughs)

10:21.023 --> 10:23.156
Now, me, myself,
I am Winston Bishop.

10:23.158 --> 10:24.624
<i> Officer</i> Winston Bishop?

10:24.626 --> 10:26.559
<i> The</i> Winston Bishop?
The Carport Hero?

10:26.561 --> 10:29.061
I knew it was you.
I saw you on TV, man.

10:29.063 --> 10:32.197
Officer, you make me want
to be a better man.  Oh.

10:32.199 --> 10:34.799
I'm gonna stop, uh, peeing
in my ex-wife's mailbox.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.467
WINSTON: No, seriously,
everybody, calm down.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.035
Act normal around me.

10:38.037 --> 10:40.337
I'm a fun guy.
I do pranks.

10:40.339 --> 10:42.672
Uh, Cece's last wedding?
The badger that fell down

10:42.674 --> 10:44.640
and almost killed a bunch
of people-- that was me!

10:44.642 --> 10:45.807
(chuckles)

10:45.809 --> 10:47.008
I'm Prank Sinatra, baby!

10:47.010 --> 10:48.509
Old Brown Eyes.

10:48.511 --> 10:50.544
Ain't no prank
like a badger prank,

10:50.546 --> 10:52.579
because a badger prank
got badgers,

10:52.581 --> 10:55.048
and it's dangerous as hell!

11:03.257 --> 11:04.990
Ms. Parikh.

11:11.664 --> 11:13.597
Who are you?

11:13.599 --> 11:16.232
Oh. My goodness.
Of course.

11:16.234 --> 11:18.601
I must be completely
unrecognizable to you

11:18.603 --> 11:21.103
from the countless photos
you must have seen.

11:21.105 --> 11:23.238
In honor of your
visit, I stood

11:23.240 --> 11:26.274
the humble recipient of
a professional shampoo.

11:26.276 --> 11:28.409
So you're the man
who's marrying my daughter?

11:28.411 --> 11:31.245
Sure am. No wonder she didn't
tell me that she was engaged.

11:31.247 --> 11:33.180
Oh.

11:33.182 --> 11:34.848
Oh, no, then.

11:34.850 --> 11:37.517
I'm assuming she was afraid
I would disapprove.

11:37.519 --> 11:39.185
But now that you've met me...
I disapprove.

11:39.187 --> 11:41.287
Mm-hmm.
<i>Strong</i> disapprove.

11:41.289 --> 11:44.556
Let's take a moment to applaud
your daughter's instincts.

11:44.558 --> 11:46.524
No, no, no.
Look, Schmidt. Mom.

11:46.526 --> 11:47.725
I'm sorry.

11:47.727 --> 11:49.059
I can explain
everything.

11:49.061 --> 11:50.093
Presenting...

11:50.962 --> 11:53.429
...Cece's mom!
(Schmidt groans)

11:53.431 --> 11:55.130
Except for that.
I'm her mom.

11:55.132 --> 11:56.564
You're her mom?
That's my mom.

11:56.566 --> 11:58.198
Then who are you?!
Not her mom.

11:58.200 --> 11:59.065
That's her mom!

11:59.067 --> 12:00.733
A dumb little boy you are!

12:00.735 --> 12:02.634
(phone ringing)

12:02.636 --> 12:04.268
Yeah. Hello.

12:04.270 --> 12:06.803
So, does Cece's mom
love Schmidt, or what?

12:06.805 --> 12:09.671
Which Cece's mom? The real one
or the one I may have kidnapped?

12:11.775 --> 12:15.042
Th-The real one?

12:15.044 --> 12:16.043
(elevator bell dings)

12:16.045 --> 12:17.377
GLEN:
Anything for Officer Bishop!

12:17.379 --> 12:18.745
The Carport Hero!

12:18.747 --> 12:22.615
Thanks, Glen. Sorry to army-
crawl into your home like that.

12:32.559 --> 12:34.058
We come from a country
of 400 million men.

12:34.060 --> 12:35.659
Let's say half of them
are no good.

12:35.661 --> 12:37.427
Another half, very ugly.

12:37.429 --> 12:40.696
That's still 100 million
eligible men.

12:41.398 --> 12:43.831
Sure, ten percent are gay.

12:43.833 --> 12:45.399
Puts us at 90 million men.

12:45.401 --> 12:47.968
Ms. Parikh, I love Cece.

12:47.970 --> 12:50.403
Cut it in half again
just for fun.

12:50.405 --> 12:52.338
45 million men.

12:58.579 --> 13:00.845
Cece, when were you gonna tell her?
I'm sorry.

13:00.847 --> 13:02.513
On our wedding day
when we were standing beneath

13:02.515 --> 13:03.914
our custom hybrid
mandap-chuppah?

13:03.916 --> 13:05.448
(crying):
I'm so sorry. I just...

13:05.450 --> 13:07.416
I wanted the moment to be right.

13:07.418 --> 13:08.483
I'm sorry.

13:13.022 --> 13:14.988
(tires screech)

13:18.859 --> 13:21.025
We meet again.

13:21.027 --> 13:23.594
(shouting):
Hello! Is anyone here?!

13:23.596 --> 13:25.262
(horn honks fanfare)

13:25.264 --> 13:26.630
Jess?

13:26.632 --> 13:28.665
Winston! Oh, thank God!

13:28.667 --> 13:30.099
I need your help.

13:30.101 --> 13:31.300
Hey, Jess, let me
ask you something.

13:31.302 --> 13:32.634
Uh, I'm a fun guy, right?

13:32.636 --> 13:34.469
I mean, I have
a way about me.

13:34.471 --> 13:36.170
Winston, look at me,
look around.

13:36.172 --> 13:38.305
Does your thing
seem important now?

13:38.307 --> 13:40.273
You're the Carport Hero.

13:40.275 --> 13:41.274
Now I need your help.

13:41.276 --> 13:43.009
No more Carport Hero!

13:43.011 --> 13:45.444
Tonight, I'm Prank Sinatra.

13:45.446 --> 13:47.646
No. No! You didn't
play a prank...

13:47.648 --> 13:49.814
You are the worst prankster
in the world!

13:49.816 --> 13:53.184
Every prank you do
turns out either too big...

13:53.186 --> 13:55.352
What is this?

13:55.354 --> 13:56.986
Did you register me

13:56.988 --> 13:58.887
as a sex offender?
(snickers)

13:58.889 --> 14:00.355
...or too small.

14:01.391 --> 14:03.557
How'd this blueberry
get in here?

14:03.559 --> 14:05.292
(mumbles):
I don't...

14:05.294 --> 14:07.494
(laughs)

14:07.496 --> 14:09.529
(whoops)

14:09.531 --> 14:11.964
You should have
saw your face!

14:11.966 --> 14:13.565
He did not see that coming.

14:13.567 --> 14:16.301
Just like no one's gonna see
what's coming tonight.

14:16.303 --> 14:17.902
Nothing should be
coming tonight.

14:17.904 --> 14:19.003
I'm sorry, Jess.

14:19.005 --> 14:21.071
The fuse has
already been lit.

14:21.073 --> 14:24.240
The lion has
spotted the gazelle.

14:24.242 --> 14:27.343
The doo-doo is already
mid-flight to the fan.

14:27.345 --> 14:30.012
The silly hounds
have been released.

14:30.014 --> 14:31.179
I repeat:

14:31.181 --> 14:34.415
the silly hounds
have been released.

14:34.417 --> 14:36.483
What did you d...
You know what, never mind.

14:36.485 --> 14:38.251
Just take me to Cece
and Schmidt, please.

14:38.253 --> 14:39.552
I did a prank. I did a... Oh.

14:40.988 --> 14:43.821
(Winston grunting)

14:45.491 --> 14:47.491
(grunting continues)

14:47.493 --> 14:49.860
I hope the scooter
fits in the elevator.

14:49.862 --> 14:51.561
There's an elevator?

14:51.563 --> 14:52.728
(speaking Hindi)

14:52.730 --> 14:54.996
I'm trying to find out
where to return you.

14:54.998 --> 14:56.497
(speaking Hindi)

14:56.499 --> 14:57.698
You have pepper spray?

14:57.700 --> 14:59.266
Why didn't you use that on me?

14:59.268 --> 15:01.634
(speaking Hindi angrily)

15:03.604 --> 15:05.337
All right,
I'll talk to you later.

15:05.339 --> 15:06.871
Well, Cece's mom
hates me.

15:06.873 --> 15:09.173
Like Jay Z, I have
99 problems.

15:09.175 --> 15:12.276
But unlike Jay Z,
I have zero caveats.

15:12.278 --> 15:14.044
I know, and I'm sorry.

15:14.046 --> 15:17.280
Okay? I'm sorry
I screwed up my easy job.

15:17.282 --> 15:18.747
(speaking Hindi angrily)

15:21.017 --> 15:22.616
And stop being
so mean to me,

15:22.618 --> 15:24.784
or I swear to God
I'm gonna fall in love with you!

15:24.786 --> 15:26.485
(speaking Hindi angrily)

15:28.355 --> 15:31.289
Where you going?
Come back.

15:31.291 --> 15:33.190
(sighs)

15:33.192 --> 15:35.425
Let me make it up to you.

15:35.427 --> 15:38.528
I know that I said
I wanted the easy job.

15:38.530 --> 15:39.795
But screw that.

15:39.797 --> 15:42.364
I'm the best man, Schmidty.

15:42.366 --> 15:43.698
I want the hard jobs.

15:43.700 --> 15:45.199
I can handle it.

15:45.201 --> 15:47.201
So what do we got?
What do we need?

15:47.203 --> 15:48.869
We're past hard at this point.

15:48.871 --> 15:51.137
We're well into impossible.

15:51.139 --> 15:52.538
It's an unfixable situa...

15:52.540 --> 15:54.072
(horn honks fanfare)
Hey.

15:54.074 --> 15:57.975
Schmidt, I did not just drive
15 miles on a gout throne

15:57.977 --> 15:59.576
to watch you give up.

15:59.578 --> 16:00.710
Especially not...

16:00.712 --> 16:04.279
♪ In the Year... of Us. ♪

16:04.281 --> 16:05.313
Look at yourself.

16:05.315 --> 16:06.747
Look around us.

16:06.749 --> 16:09.216
Maybe this isn't our year.
I have a plan.

16:09.218 --> 16:10.959
And whatever it is, I'm in.
I got this guy's back.

16:10.985 --> 16:12.052
Don't think we actually need...

16:12.054 --> 16:14.220
I know, but I'm in, is what I'm saying.
That... I mean...

16:14.222 --> 16:15.588
♪ Whatever it is, I want in. ♪

16:15.590 --> 16:17.222
Okay, whatever.
I want in.

16:17.224 --> 16:18.423
Schmidt, how important is this to you?
Have I made that clear?

16:18.425 --> 16:20.258
That I want to be, like, a third.
You can be in.

16:20.260 --> 16:21.058
You're in.

16:21.060 --> 16:22.059
You're in.
Thanks.

16:22.061 --> 16:23.560
That's all
I wanted her to say.

16:23.562 --> 16:25.428
Are you willing to do
whatever it takes?

16:25.430 --> 16:26.562
Of course.

16:26.564 --> 16:28.263
I also didn't love
the tone that, like,

16:28.265 --> 16:30.064
"I'm in, but who cares
that I'm in?"

16:30.066 --> 16:31.398
JESS (over speakers):
Ladies and gentlemen,

16:31.400 --> 16:33.900
could I have
your attention please?

16:33.902 --> 16:35.234
Hello.

16:35.236 --> 16:36.735
I'm Jessica Day.

16:36.737 --> 16:39.170
I'm the maid of honor,
but when I fell down the stairs,

16:39.172 --> 16:41.505
I wished I was made of rubber.

16:41.507 --> 16:43.073
(laughs)

16:43.075 --> 16:45.408
(man coughing quietly)

16:45.410 --> 16:48.077
Uh...

16:48.079 --> 16:50.679
This one goes out to the secret
romantic in the audience.

16:50.681 --> 16:53.415
Just a little reminder
that love...

16:53.417 --> 16:55.083
(chuckles) conquers all.

16:55.085 --> 16:58.652
And without further ado,
MaHotMoves Gandhi.

17:00.422 --> 17:01.854
Follow me, follow me.

17:01.856 --> 17:02.855
Follow me!

17:02.857 --> 17:04.590
(upbeat Indian music playing)

17:19.773 --> 17:21.839
(upbeat Indian music continues)

17:26.946 --> 17:28.478
Think they're all
really friends?

17:28.480 --> 17:31.581
You know, I mean, when
the dancing day is done?

17:34.953 --> 17:36.352
(crowd cheering)

17:38.456 --> 17:40.022
(upbeat Indian music continues)

17:54.671 --> 17:57.138
(crowd laughing, cheering)

18:12.988 --> 18:15.121
(upbeat Indian music continues)

18:30.004 --> 18:32.070
(music ends, crowd cheering)

18:35.175 --> 18:36.574
(whoops)

18:42.381 --> 18:43.847
(Jess laughs)

18:43.849 --> 18:45.448
Hey.

18:45.450 --> 18:46.515
That was great.

18:46.517 --> 18:47.516
Fantastic.

18:47.518 --> 18:50.018
Wonderful.

18:53.723 --> 18:55.789
JESS:
Where'd she go?

19:00.528 --> 19:01.527
JESS:
Mrs. Parikh? Please, wait.

19:01.529 --> 19:03.362
Stop. Look. (sighs)

19:03.364 --> 19:05.130
It was my idea.

19:05.132 --> 19:07.198
I thought we could sway you
with the power of dance.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.533
You really think
a dance is all it takes?

19:09.535 --> 19:11.701
CECE: Mom, I know that Schmidt
is not what you imagined.

19:11.703 --> 19:13.703
Or what I imagined.

19:13.705 --> 19:15.304
I never thought
I would fall for

19:15.306 --> 19:17.706
the slim-hipped
ghost of Tom Cruise.

19:17.708 --> 19:19.040
None of us did.

19:19.042 --> 19:21.042
Quiet, Chair.

19:21.044 --> 19:22.276
But I love him.

19:23.712 --> 19:26.512
He makes me so happy,
and I'm gonna marry him.

19:30.150 --> 19:32.383
I will not give my blessing.

19:39.224 --> 19:42.458
Cece, Schmidt...

19:43.828 --> 19:45.894
(groaning):
Oh, God.

19:45.896 --> 19:47.562
Crunch. Ah...

19:47.564 --> 19:49.196
Shoot me.

19:51.133 --> 19:52.298
(sighs)

19:52.300 --> 19:53.798
You have my blessing.

19:56.235 --> 19:58.902
You have my
blessing, too.

19:58.904 --> 20:01.504
Mine, too.

20:01.506 --> 20:03.839
Oh, come on,
Not-Cece's mom.

20:03.841 --> 20:05.240
That would've
been awesome.

20:05.242 --> 20:07.075
It was a natural three.

20:07.077 --> 20:08.042
You got to finish.

20:13.949 --> 20:15.515
We'll get her on board.

20:15.517 --> 20:16.849
I promise.

20:16.851 --> 20:18.116
Oh, she's gonna get hers.

20:18.118 --> 20:19.283
No, no, Winston, no.

20:19.285 --> 20:20.784
What did you do? No pranks.

20:20.786 --> 20:21.751
Such bad timing.

20:21.753 --> 20:22.618
Hey, Mrs. Parikh.

20:22.620 --> 20:25.387
Check your shoe.

20:29.092 --> 20:31.358
(Winston snickers)

20:31.360 --> 20:33.460
Tickle foot! (laughs)

20:33.462 --> 20:35.428
I put a feather in your shoe!

20:35.430 --> 20:36.829
(laughing)

20:39.700 --> 20:41.800
Too small, dude.

20:41.802 --> 20:43.434
Way too small.

20:44.603 --> 20:46.102
I've revised my vision.

20:46.104 --> 20:47.436
Honey, without my mom's help,

20:47.438 --> 20:49.938
I don't think we can afford
to parachute the rabbi in.

20:49.940 --> 20:51.272
Well, that's why
I've pared it down

20:51.274 --> 20:52.873
to only the things that matter.
That's great.

20:52.875 --> 20:54.107
We can throw
a wedding

20:54.109 --> 20:55.108
on a budget.

20:55.110 --> 20:56.109
This is our year.

20:56.111 --> 20:57.110
We can do anything.

20:59.647 --> 21:01.113
Now, who's gonna
take me to the john?

21:01.115 --> 21:02.781
Not it! Really? You're
the only girl here.

21:02.783 --> 21:03.782
I can't.
It hurts my back.

21:03.784 --> 21:04.983
Who keeps giving her juice?

21:04.985 --> 21:07.518
You're in a senility
scooter; use a diaper!

21:07.520 --> 21:11.488
♪ And it took a long time ♪

21:11.490 --> 21:14.958
♪ To find you ♪

21:14.960 --> 21:17.359
♪ But I finally found you. ♪

21:19.996 --> 21:21.328
(laughs quietly)

21:21.330 --> 21:22.829
That's a good tickle.

21:22.831 --> 21:24.697
(laughs):
Oh.

21:33.407 --> 21:35.807
Easy, Winnie.

21:35.809 --> 21:36.808
(thud, Winston grunts)

21:36.810 --> 21:38.810
(Winston panting)

21:38.812 --> 21:40.812
