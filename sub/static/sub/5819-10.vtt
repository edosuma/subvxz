00:00.552 --> 00:01.843
Previously on "The Originals"...

00:01.874 --> 00:04.045
If this prophecy is fulfilled,

00:04.075 --> 00:05.283
you will all fall...

00:05.313 --> 00:07.368
One by friend, one by foe,

00:07.398 --> 00:09.265
and one by family.

00:09.517 --> 00:11.422
When I am buried, the
family part of the prophecy

00:11.452 --> 00:12.356
will be over.

00:12.386 --> 00:14.291
Elijah, do it!

00:14.321 --> 00:16.622
Someone is ascending to the regency,

00:16.624 --> 00:19.992
the witch who was once
inhabited by Finn Mikaelson.

00:19.994 --> 00:22.149
They took it, the Serratura.

00:22.179 --> 00:24.596
The weapon that's used to
take down Klaus and Elijah?

00:24.598 --> 00:25.820
I was meeting with a witch.

00:25.850 --> 00:27.488
I was hoping she could help me destroy it.

00:27.518 --> 00:30.068
The only way to get
rid of it, is to use it.

00:30.070 --> 00:32.821
Do you actually love her?

00:33.941 --> 00:35.441
I've lost count of the amount of times

00:35.443 --> 00:37.238
you've been there for me.

00:39.947 --> 00:42.981
No. No!

00:46.270 --> 00:47.690
I think you're far more affected

00:47.720 --> 00:49.638
by this world than you care to admit.

00:49.640 --> 00:52.307
You want to control it rather than allow

00:52.309 --> 00:53.551
it to control you.

00:53.581 --> 00:56.762
The inevitable, unavoidable parts of life

00:56.764 --> 00:58.775
make you uneasy.

00:58.805 --> 01:02.333
No, no, no, no.

01:03.137 --> 01:05.683
Aah! Ugh!

01:05.912 --> 01:08.130
Some might say death is inevitable,

01:08.160 --> 01:10.760
and yet here I am a thousand years old,

01:10.790 --> 01:12.700
sipping an exquisite aged whiskey

01:12.730 --> 01:15.345
while a beguiling muse sits across from me.

01:15.375 --> 01:18.684
I am the perfect picture
of health and vitality,

01:18.686 --> 01:20.269
a master of my fate,

01:20.271 --> 01:22.821
a conqueror of death itself.

01:22.823 --> 01:26.046
Aah! Yaah!

01:26.076 --> 01:27.698
See? That's exactly my point.

01:27.728 --> 01:30.395
You make some glib,
throwaway line about death

01:30.397 --> 01:33.237
as though it means nothing
to you, but it does.

01:33.267 --> 01:35.689
If not your own, then at
least the death of others.

01:35.719 --> 01:37.858
So beneath the devilish banter

01:37.888 --> 01:39.304
and charming wit,

01:39.306 --> 01:41.159
Klaus Mikaelson bears the burden

01:41.189 --> 01:45.155
of a deep-seated psychological
trauma about death.

01:45.853 --> 01:47.252
Ragh!

01:47.282 --> 01:48.534
Ohh!

01:50.741 --> 01:52.986
I'll tell you what I
know about death, Camille.

01:53.016 --> 01:57.412
Death dances silently in everyone's shadow,

01:57.414 --> 02:00.878
And she doesn't give a damn, so...

02:01.441 --> 02:03.785
Why give a damn about her?

02:04.232 --> 02:06.233
You do give a damn.

02:07.007 --> 02:08.840
Why else surround yourself with immortals

02:08.842 --> 02:11.710
if not to avoid the agony of loss?

02:14.465 --> 02:17.516
You disagree. Fine.

02:17.518 --> 02:20.435
I hope it's a long time
before I'm proven right.

== sync & corrections by Wolfhound ==

03:04.982 --> 03:07.265
Tell me what happened.

03:11.989 --> 03:13.443
Aurora.

03:14.775 --> 03:17.498
The moment he looks at
you as he looked at me.

03:17.528 --> 03:20.204
The moment you know he is in love with you,

03:20.234 --> 03:22.484
you're going to do something for me.

03:25.747 --> 03:28.461
You will drink this blood of mine,

03:28.491 --> 03:30.419
and then you will slit your own throat

03:30.449 --> 03:32.461
and bleed out silently.

03:32.491 --> 03:33.917
You will want to cry out,

03:33.947 --> 03:36.548
but you will not make a sound.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.940
She did this to me.

03:41.057 --> 03:42.771
I died.

03:46.066 --> 03:47.551
I'm dead.

03:49.340 --> 03:52.376
Well, you will not stay dead.

03:53.651 --> 03:56.440
She will pay for her
actions, I swear to you!

03:57.521 --> 04:00.105
Oh, what's happening to me?

04:00.107 --> 04:02.065
You're transitioning.

04:02.471 --> 04:04.810
You need to feed on blood soon,

04:05.001 --> 04:07.429
or you will die again, this time for good.

04:46.069 --> 04:47.235
How is she?

04:47.237 --> 04:49.243
She's just risen from the dead.

04:49.273 --> 04:52.196
As soon as she feeds, her mood
will change for the better.

04:52.226 --> 04:55.026
In the meantime, these
attacks need to be answered!

04:55.028 --> 04:56.645
Our retribution must be swift,

04:56.647 --> 04:57.746
and it must be brutal!

04:57.776 --> 05:01.028
Agreed. After the Serratura
has been recovered.

05:01.565 --> 05:04.625
Freya's pendant is also missing.

05:04.655 --> 05:07.022
And Finn's mystical essence along with it.

05:07.024 --> 05:08.940
So let the imbecile stay lost.

05:08.942 --> 05:11.576
Our business today is to
finish off the de Martels.

05:11.578 --> 05:13.400
No, brother. Think, think.

05:13.430 --> 05:14.930
Tristan needs the most
powerful witch in the city

05:14.932 --> 05:16.515
to activate that weapon,

05:16.717 --> 05:18.678
A Regent.

05:18.708 --> 05:20.222
Vincent,

05:20.252 --> 05:22.103
who was once possessed by Finn!

05:22.105 --> 05:25.121
No. Stay here.

05:25.538 --> 05:27.392
She will need you, brother.

05:47.142 --> 05:49.548
I trust this won't take much longer.

05:49.550 --> 05:50.508
I'm on a schedule.

05:50.538 --> 05:51.958
Look, man. If you want me to activate

05:51.988 --> 05:54.786
your big, bad Serratura, you're gonna
have to backup, give me some space.

05:55.066 --> 05:58.161
Or I could always have my witch put Finn

05:58.191 --> 05:59.261
back inside of you,

05:59.291 --> 06:01.548
have him complete the deed.

06:01.578 --> 06:06.045
I'm sure he'd be quite pleased
to aid in his brothers' downfall.

06:08.268 --> 06:10.769
I do this for you, I get that pendant.

06:10.771 --> 06:13.388
Of course. That was the deal.

06:23.759 --> 06:26.735
"Reveye ak.

06:26.737 --> 06:32.240
"Reveye moman ak trape dife.

06:32.242 --> 06:35.243
"Moman ou sè prè.

06:35.245 --> 06:39.082
"Tann prizonye ou".

06:44.067 --> 06:46.080
There.

06:48.725 --> 06:51.476
You wanted it, you got it.

06:53.130 --> 06:54.379
Give me the pendant.

06:54.381 --> 06:56.105
Hold him here.

06:56.762 --> 06:57.955
No, no, no, no, no.

06:57.985 --> 06:59.656
We may have use for him yet.

06:59.686 --> 07:02.270
You really want to cross a Tremé witch?

07:03.490 --> 07:04.773
If he acts up,

07:04.803 --> 07:08.683
place my old friend Finn back inside him.

07:10.207 --> 07:13.448
Ok. You poked the witches nest.

07:13.635 --> 07:15.064
What's your plan now?

07:15.094 --> 07:17.536
Heh heh. Worry will be
the death of you, Marcel.

07:17.842 --> 07:20.205
The rest of our plan is already in play.

07:23.498 --> 07:25.509
Still say we should take my dartboard.

07:25.539 --> 07:27.245
Your calendar girls, too?

07:27.710 --> 07:29.331
Some things are best left behind, Jack,

07:29.333 --> 07:32.087
and besides, I let you
take your bow and arrow.

07:32.117 --> 07:33.585
Not exactly sure what we're gonna hunt

07:33.587 --> 07:35.303
in the French Quarter, though.

07:35.450 --> 07:36.434
Hipsters.

07:37.850 --> 07:38.850
Jack!

07:40.880 --> 07:43.951
You gonna hide in the woods, or are
you gonna come out here and fight?

07:43.981 --> 07:44.980
Agh!

07:44.982 --> 07:46.014
Gladly.

08:07.771 --> 08:08.770
Hayley!

08:08.772 --> 08:10.138
Aah!

08:10.346 --> 08:11.605
Jack!

08:11.635 --> 08:13.308
Agh!

08:16.063 --> 08:17.445
Unh!

08:32.837 --> 08:34.455
Uh. The light is killing me.

08:34.657 --> 08:36.467
You'll adjust.

08:36.885 --> 08:39.794
Why does the music sound so loud?

08:40.875 --> 08:43.496
Why does everything hurt so much.

08:43.663 --> 08:45.405
As soon as you feed, your heightened senses

08:45.435 --> 08:48.948
will cease to be painful and become...

08:49.735 --> 08:51.073
euphoric.

08:52.408 --> 08:55.090
You just assume I'm gonna do it?

08:57.461 --> 09:00.280
Feed on human blood?

09:00.310 --> 09:02.630
What did I expect? I chose to live here

09:02.952 --> 09:04.952
right along all of you,
knowing what you are.

09:04.954 --> 09:08.205
What the hell did I think was gonna happen?

09:08.207 --> 09:11.258
This was only ever gonna end one way.

09:12.595 --> 09:13.750
I deserve this.

09:13.780 --> 09:15.613
No one deserves this,

09:15.715 --> 09:16.950
not unless they choose it,

09:16.980 --> 09:18.972
and some of us don't have that choice.

09:19.002 --> 09:20.418
We just have to survive

09:20.420 --> 09:22.003
what is forced upon us.

09:22.005 --> 09:24.734
But I do have a choice.

09:25.622 --> 09:28.009
I can choose not to feed.

09:37.287 --> 09:39.470
Hmm. You're an obeah witch, right?

09:40.054 --> 09:42.356
Older sect, too, with all
that show you got going on.

09:42.358 --> 09:44.058
Do not speak to me.

09:46.471 --> 09:47.945
You're powerful witches,

09:47.947 --> 09:49.769
proud people,

09:49.799 --> 09:51.632
and rightly so from what I understand.

09:51.634 --> 09:55.353
I mean, you don't usually
bow down to anybody.

09:58.228 --> 10:00.802
Your ancestors must be turning
in their graves right now,

10:00.832 --> 10:02.360
watching you running around here,

10:02.362 --> 10:04.141
doing a vampire's business.

10:04.171 --> 10:06.274
I said do not talk.

10:06.304 --> 10:07.949
Yeah, I heard you.

10:08.089 --> 10:09.317
I just have to know.

10:09.319 --> 10:11.619
What does it feel like

10:11.621 --> 10:14.334
to be a backstabbing traitor?

10:15.102 --> 10:17.291
Stay on task.

10:28.471 --> 10:30.888
This is for your ancestors.

10:33.426 --> 10:34.892
Aah!

10:34.894 --> 10:36.727
May they judge you harshly.

10:44.520 --> 10:48.045
Unh! Agh!

10:53.696 --> 10:55.496
Vincent...

10:57.150 --> 10:58.893
we should chat.

11:01.786 --> 11:03.087
No!

11:35.721 --> 11:37.532
Oh, I miss him.

11:41.292 --> 11:44.417
He just wanted me to be happy,

11:44.447 --> 11:46.364
Get married, have a few kids.

11:50.180 --> 11:54.288
I guess the great O'Connell
family line endeth here.

11:54.290 --> 11:56.003
You know...

11:57.284 --> 12:00.480
I never really got, uh...

12:00.510 --> 12:03.177
the comfort he got from his faith,

12:03.746 --> 12:07.181
but right now, I wish I
believed in an afterlife.

12:07.544 --> 12:12.198
Vampirism is by definition an afterlife.

12:13.165 --> 12:17.074
Which one is it, Klaus, Heaven or Hell?

12:17.476 --> 12:18.592
Look. I don't know what to tell you, man.

12:18.594 --> 12:19.885
You want your big, bad Serratura,

12:19.915 --> 12:20.984
you're gonna have to go after Tristan

12:21.014 --> 12:22.213
because he took it with him

12:22.215 --> 12:24.182
after he forced me to activate it.

12:24.454 --> 12:25.815
So deactivate it.

12:25.845 --> 12:27.301
I couldn't even if I wanted to,

12:27.303 --> 12:29.412
and just for the record, I'm all done

12:29.442 --> 12:31.877
with vampire demands for the day.

12:31.907 --> 12:32.957
Push me and see what happens.

12:32.987 --> 12:34.709
You don't want to see what happens.

12:35.211 --> 12:36.983
My family's in jeopardy,
you're responsible.

12:37.013 --> 12:38.712
That's on you, man!

12:38.852 --> 12:40.348
If Tristan didn't have the pendant,

12:40.378 --> 12:43.100
then he wouldn't have any leverage over me.

12:47.475 --> 12:48.802
Uh...

12:50.626 --> 12:53.586
The longer you wait,
the more you'll suffer.

12:54.880 --> 12:56.802
You know,

12:56.956 --> 12:59.049
I think it's better this way.

12:59.051 --> 13:02.002
I mean, look at me.

13:02.004 --> 13:04.755
I'm gonna make a super hot corpse, right?

13:04.757 --> 13:06.358
- Perfect for an open casket.
- Camille.

13:06.388 --> 13:09.532
I want my wake to be at
Rousseau's. I want it to be epic...

13:09.562 --> 13:11.979
An open bar and dancing,

13:11.981 --> 13:13.289
and no one cries, or I come back,

13:13.319 --> 13:15.819
- and I poltergeist the hell out of...
- Stop it!

13:17.353 --> 13:21.014
I will not entertain this
kind of talk any longer.

13:21.044 --> 13:22.723
You must feed.

13:25.144 --> 13:27.177
I need you.

13:37.156 --> 13:39.712
This is not about you. This is about me.

13:39.742 --> 13:41.176
I like who I am.

13:41.206 --> 13:43.280
I've spent my entire life being

13:43.310 --> 13:45.496
this exact version of sane,

13:45.498 --> 13:48.320
and if I turn, if I become a vampire,

13:48.350 --> 13:49.953
I don't know what I'll be,

13:49.983 --> 13:51.224
I don't know who I'll be.

13:51.254 --> 13:52.608
I know.

13:53.022 --> 13:55.369
I know you'll be an extension
of the person you are now.

13:55.399 --> 13:57.230
You'll be strong and... and understanding

13:57.260 --> 13:58.805
- and brave.
- No!

13:58.835 --> 14:00.619
You don't know me!

14:00.649 --> 14:03.119
You think you know me, but you don't.

14:03.466 --> 14:05.799
There is a darkness
inside of everyone, Klaus.

14:06.077 --> 14:08.285
- What if mine takes over?
- I won't let it.

14:08.315 --> 14:11.344
You can barely contain your own darkness.

14:12.229 --> 14:16.551
It is better I die as someone I'm
proud of than live as someone I despise.

14:16.581 --> 14:20.613
No! It's better a flawed life
lived than wasted rotting in clay!

14:21.533 --> 14:23.133
It's not gonna happen,

14:23.135 --> 14:24.752
Not to you.

14:31.008 --> 14:32.206
Hey.

14:32.545 --> 14:34.875
I'm not gonna feed, all right?

14:35.164 --> 14:36.914
So you can either respect that,

14:37.079 --> 14:39.300
or we can spend the last...

14:39.490 --> 14:42.608
Couple of hours we have together

14:42.913 --> 14:44.638
in a screaming match.

14:57.238 --> 14:58.454
I tried that.

14:59.797 --> 15:01.810
I tried that.

15:02.276 --> 15:06.893
The more you struggle, the more
wolfsbane gets pumped into your veins.

15:13.901 --> 15:16.587
Jack, your leg.

15:16.589 --> 15:18.584
Are you ok?

15:19.041 --> 15:22.987
Yeah. They worked me over pretty good.

15:23.670 --> 15:26.680
With all the... the wolfsbane in my system,

15:26.682 --> 15:28.465
I ain't healing so well.

15:30.020 --> 15:31.719
Just breathe.

15:31.924 --> 15:33.937
When we get a chance to fight, be ready.

15:34.264 --> 15:35.895
Hayley, Hayley, listen.

15:35.925 --> 15:39.008
I don't know if I'm gonna get that chance.

15:39.518 --> 15:41.228
Stop.

15:41.230 --> 15:42.601
We are gonna get out of here, Jack.

15:42.631 --> 15:45.182
I love you. Ok?

15:45.184 --> 15:47.873
- I've... I've always loved you.
- Don't.

15:49.753 --> 15:53.656
When I first saw you, I broke.

15:53.995 --> 15:56.360
You broke me,

15:56.362 --> 15:59.062
and nothing has ever been the same since.

16:01.406 --> 16:05.569
I just want to know that it was all real.

16:05.695 --> 16:10.790
Every moment, every touch, every word.

16:11.564 --> 16:13.685
How absolutely darling

16:13.715 --> 16:14.845
or pathetic.

16:14.847 --> 16:17.103
I suppose it's all relative.

16:17.133 --> 16:18.582
You let us out of here, or so help me,

16:18.584 --> 16:20.301
I will kill you!

16:20.303 --> 16:23.937
Hmm. Somehow, I doubt it.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.558
I've been pondering this moment

16:27.560 --> 16:30.714
since you tortured me.

16:31.119 --> 16:32.176
Ugh!

16:32.206 --> 16:37.818
What's the best way to truly hurt a hybrid?

16:37.820 --> 16:38.986
And then it came to me.

16:38.988 --> 16:41.488
- Ugh!
- No! No!

16:41.490 --> 16:42.990
Aah!

16:42.992 --> 16:44.942
No! No!

17:02.847 --> 17:04.151
Freya?

17:04.974 --> 17:06.097
What's happening?

17:06.127 --> 17:08.063
A messenger came.

17:08.223 --> 17:10.653
Some compelled tourist.

17:11.269 --> 17:12.934
He left this.

17:30.126 --> 17:32.184
- Who?
- Jackson.

17:34.976 --> 17:37.009
Courtesy of the Strix.

17:49.165 --> 17:51.273
So unless we meet their demands,

17:51.275 --> 17:53.692
Hayley will be next.

18:07.637 --> 18:10.075
Jack, I'm so sorry.

18:12.360 --> 18:16.566
I never should have brought
any of this into your life.

18:18.232 --> 18:22.517
I was so selfish.

18:23.648 --> 18:29.947
I never met anyone who was
always just there for me.

18:32.593 --> 18:35.767
You let me feel what it is to be loved.

18:48.058 --> 18:51.249
But I will make them suffer for this.

18:51.429 --> 18:53.757
I promise you.

18:54.545 --> 18:57.339
I will make all of them suffer.

19:03.130 --> 19:04.128
Let go of me!

19:04.158 --> 19:06.827
I'm afraid I don't have
time to be delicate.

19:12.931 --> 19:13.976
What the hell?

19:14.006 --> 19:17.408
I had Freya create a boundary spell.

19:17.438 --> 19:18.702
- Klaus.
- I'm off to save

19:18.732 --> 19:19.695
the mother of my child,

19:19.725 --> 19:21.058
and to do so, I must face those

19:21.088 --> 19:22.496
with a distinct advantage.

19:22.526 --> 19:24.478
I cannot wage war if
I am worried about you,

19:24.508 --> 19:26.061
and I will not entertain any thought

19:26.063 --> 19:26.950
of letting you die.

19:26.980 --> 19:29.106
You have no right to do this.

19:30.496 --> 19:32.970
I will be back long before you starve.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.185
In the meantime, if the
pain should get too great,

19:35.215 --> 19:39.691
I suggest you stop this
foolishness and feed.

19:39.955 --> 19:41.078
Type O negative.

19:41.108 --> 19:43.200
Just a hint of copper aftertaste.

19:43.230 --> 19:45.831
Trust me, you'll learn to love it.

19:47.656 --> 19:49.584
This is the same as force-feeding me!

19:49.586 --> 19:51.256
Klaus!

19:51.286 --> 19:53.672
If you care about me at all,

19:53.958 --> 19:55.354
you won't do this.

19:58.551 --> 20:02.059
I will never forgive you.

20:02.343 --> 20:03.505
I'm just going to have to risk

20:03.507 --> 20:06.008
you never forgiving me.

20:06.259 --> 20:09.299
I'll never forgive myself if I let you die.

20:10.479 --> 20:11.479
No!

20:12.425 --> 20:13.483
Two Original vampires

20:13.513 --> 20:14.571
and two powerful witches

20:14.601 --> 20:16.184
against an army of miscreants...

20:16.331 --> 20:17.737
I'm rather looking forward to it.

20:17.767 --> 20:19.239
Keep in mind that I'm mortal,

20:19.269 --> 20:21.556
and as much as I want
these guys out of my city,

20:21.558 --> 20:24.486
I like breathing, so
let me go to the covens.

20:24.516 --> 20:25.813
I can propose an alliance.

20:25.843 --> 20:27.863
They hate you guys, but if
I explain what's going on...

20:27.865 --> 20:29.031
There's no time.

20:29.133 --> 20:30.908
There never is,

20:30.938 --> 20:32.589
but before we rush into battle,

20:32.619 --> 20:34.375
let's keep in mind that Tristan may be

20:34.405 --> 20:36.822
the very foe to lead you to your doom.

20:38.536 --> 20:41.360
Isn't this exactly what
the prophecy foretold?

20:41.522 --> 20:43.050
Rebekah's on the run.

20:43.249 --> 20:46.565
I will not lose the two of you, as well.

20:46.595 --> 20:48.250
Rebekah's safe.

20:49.728 --> 20:51.703
Brother, perhaps you should stay.

20:51.705 --> 20:53.872
And what kind of father would I be

20:53.874 --> 20:56.124
if I didn't fight for
the mother of my child?

20:56.326 --> 20:59.076
No. I have no intention
of being outmaneuvered

20:59.106 --> 21:00.814
by Tristan de Martel of all people.

21:00.844 --> 21:02.929
Intention's got nothing to do with it.

21:02.959 --> 21:04.663
As long as Tristan de Martel

21:04.693 --> 21:07.221
has the Serratura and your baby's mama,

21:07.251 --> 21:08.553
the advantage is all his.

21:08.555 --> 21:11.605
Well, then we should take
that advantage from him.

21:14.331 --> 21:15.894
I'm gonna need something that belonged

21:15.896 --> 21:17.396
to his sister.

21:34.915 --> 21:37.883
Sispann agresè.

21:38.487 --> 21:39.835
Run him down.

22:10.584 --> 22:12.117
Nice timing.

22:14.074 --> 22:15.837
Oh. My love,

22:16.131 --> 22:17.956
I knew you'd find me.

22:21.305 --> 22:23.378
Hello, Camille.

22:23.735 --> 22:25.597
What do you want?

22:25.829 --> 22:26.913
Have you come to gloat?

22:26.943 --> 22:29.990
Actually, I'm quite
sympathetic to your plight.

22:30.370 --> 22:33.555
I was once denied the
right to die with dignity.

22:33.811 --> 22:37.225
I grew to hate the one who
took that choice away from me,

22:37.574 --> 22:42.030
so if you have decided to die, so be it.

22:54.340 --> 22:55.794
Thank you.

22:56.055 --> 22:57.619
All things considered,
that's the nicest thing

22:57.649 --> 22:59.714
anyone's done for me all day.

23:00.041 --> 23:01.589
As you prepare for what's to come,

23:01.619 --> 23:04.469
I would offer you another choice.

23:04.692 --> 23:08.507
You can starve alone,

23:08.694 --> 23:10.516
or you can choose to risk what remains

23:10.546 --> 23:13.147
of your life to help me.

23:22.395 --> 23:24.495
If you touch a hair on her head...

23:24.980 --> 23:27.381
I'll do my very best to
restrain my brother, Tristan,

23:27.411 --> 23:30.013
but you and I both know
he can be impossibly savage

23:30.043 --> 23:31.535
when he wants to be.

23:31.565 --> 23:32.889
State your terms.

23:32.919 --> 23:35.350
You'll meet us at Patrick's
dock, the warehouse.

23:35.352 --> 23:38.153
We exchange Aurora for
Hayley and the Serratura.

23:38.416 --> 23:41.411
Oh. Tristan, I would make it snappy

23:41.441 --> 23:42.863
unless of course you want Niklaus

23:42.893 --> 23:45.560
to eviscerate that poor girl.

23:48.265 --> 23:51.138
Go retrieve that filthy cur.

23:51.168 --> 23:53.001
Double the dosage of wolfsbane.

23:53.003 --> 23:54.958
Make certain she suffers.

23:54.988 --> 23:56.321
Now hold up.

23:56.581 --> 23:58.073
Maybe we should think this through, huh?

23:58.075 --> 23:59.629
I already have.

23:59.659 --> 24:01.024
The Mikaelsons want to make a deal,

24:01.054 --> 24:03.611
so I'll give them exactly what they want,

24:03.613 --> 24:05.187
and once I know Aurora is safe,

24:05.217 --> 24:09.000
I'll order the Strix to descend en masse.

24:09.002 --> 24:11.758
Before the night is over,

24:13.039 --> 24:15.590
we will seal them away for all time.

24:26.331 --> 24:28.166
You think this is gonna work?

24:28.168 --> 24:29.668
You are a Regent to the city

24:29.670 --> 24:32.871
filled with the power of your ancestors.

24:32.873 --> 24:34.840
I can channel you, add your power to mine,

24:34.842 --> 24:37.843
and then we'll see.

24:39.596 --> 24:40.962
Fair enough.

24:43.016 --> 24:47.853
Kache l'nan san. Je chèch je yo.

24:49.890 --> 24:51.473
Here they come.

25:02.096 --> 25:04.069
Gentlemen.

25:04.071 --> 25:06.121
I wish I could say it was a pleasure.

25:06.123 --> 25:09.958
Marcellus, made your bed
with the enemy, I see.

25:09.960 --> 25:13.033
Membership has its privileges.

25:14.009 --> 25:16.164
Let's get on with this, shall we?

25:24.209 --> 25:25.716
Hayley Marshall Kenner

25:25.746 --> 25:27.959
only slightly worse for wear.

25:27.989 --> 25:30.428
You'll have to forgive
her if she seems a bit off.

25:30.430 --> 25:32.369
There's enough wolfsbane in her system

25:32.399 --> 25:34.199
to kill an entire pack.

25:34.201 --> 25:37.452
However, here she is as requested.

25:37.620 --> 25:39.237
Now where's my sister?

25:39.239 --> 25:42.991
She lives. You can thank Elijah for that.

25:42.993 --> 25:46.950
I wanted to flay her and
hang her skin as a flag.

25:46.980 --> 25:48.530
Anyway, enough chitchat.

25:48.532 --> 25:51.399
Let's conclude this
tedious business, shall we?

25:56.790 --> 25:59.825
My sister first,

26:00.011 --> 26:03.451
and if you're tempted to argue,

26:03.481 --> 26:05.247
consider the numbers.

26:32.365 --> 26:35.460
If they try anything, attack.

26:49.474 --> 26:51.960
Oh, brother, you came for me.

26:52.135 --> 26:53.461
Always.

26:57.457 --> 26:58.514
Come on.

26:58.544 --> 27:02.080
Ohh. Come on. Come on.

27:10.813 --> 27:12.280
Rory...

27:14.491 --> 27:16.034
What are you doing?

27:26.967 --> 27:32.300
No. Aurora, what have you done to us?

27:32.302 --> 27:35.861
Kache l'nan san. Je chèch je yo.

27:35.891 --> 27:39.307
Kache l'nan san. Je chèch je yo.

27:39.449 --> 27:40.308
Not to us.

27:40.310 --> 27:41.518
Aurora.

27:41.548 --> 27:43.094
To you.

27:45.582 --> 27:49.401
Kache l'nan san. Je chèch je yo.

27:56.144 --> 27:58.193
What is this?

27:58.195 --> 28:00.445
You know what they say.

28:00.670 --> 28:02.886
Payback's a bitch.

28:03.195 --> 28:05.250
How is this possible?

28:05.419 --> 28:08.503
The Serratura creates
an impenetrable boundary.

28:08.658 --> 28:10.630
Nothing living or dead can pass through.

28:10.660 --> 28:13.375
And thanks to your lunatic
sister, I'm neither.

28:13.377 --> 28:14.645
No.

28:15.925 --> 28:17.010
No.

28:18.432 --> 28:19.481
No!

28:20.720 --> 28:21.883
Stay close to me, ok?

28:21.885 --> 28:25.186
What are you waiting for? Take them now!

28:28.525 --> 28:30.141
Before you rush headlong

28:30.143 --> 28:34.062
toward almost certain death,

28:34.064 --> 28:36.848
As your sire, I would
like to invite you all

28:36.878 --> 28:40.728
to employ just a little
bit of common sense.

28:40.758 --> 28:43.455
We are ancient vampires, Elijah,

28:43.670 --> 28:45.957
each of us almost as strong as you.

28:45.959 --> 28:49.972
You might almost be
successful in subduing us,

28:50.950 --> 28:52.714
but at what price?

28:52.927 --> 28:55.038
Most of you will die in the process,

28:55.068 --> 28:58.053
and for what?

28:58.055 --> 29:01.923
To avenge a fool

29:02.155 --> 29:03.892
marching you headlong

29:04.136 --> 29:05.477
toward your very extinction

29:05.479 --> 29:07.716
in the name of a witch's prophecy?

29:07.746 --> 29:09.742
You do realize he engineered

29:09.772 --> 29:11.349
absolutely all of this

29:11.351 --> 29:13.817
purely to satisfy some petty grievance

29:13.847 --> 29:15.437
against my family?

29:15.439 --> 29:16.715
Tristan...

29:18.531 --> 29:19.982
doesn't care for any of you.

29:20.012 --> 29:22.575
Stop listening to him!

29:22.605 --> 29:25.080
The only danger here

29:25.247 --> 29:27.866
is the choice that you must make.

29:28.126 --> 29:30.785
You see, I'm not your enemy.

29:30.787 --> 29:32.120
It's true.

29:32.358 --> 29:33.863
I delivered you into this existence.

29:33.893 --> 29:35.707
I can just as easily pluck you out of it.

29:35.709 --> 29:39.044
The choice is yours to make.

29:43.100 --> 29:45.600
It's done. The moment has passed.

29:45.602 --> 29:50.271
Be smart, Aya, smarter than Tristan.

29:50.433 --> 29:52.857
Don't waste any more of our guys.

29:58.365 --> 29:59.774
Stand down.

29:59.804 --> 30:02.033
You will not abandon me.

30:15.916 --> 30:18.466
It's a shame it has to end like this.

30:18.649 --> 30:22.587
Aya, this isn't over.

30:22.897 --> 30:27.222
May the ghosts of our
fallen keep you company.

30:27.399 --> 30:30.097
Aya. Aya!

30:30.621 --> 30:32.397
Aya!

30:41.802 --> 30:43.293
Where are you going?

30:44.297 --> 30:45.672
Are you so eager to die?

30:45.702 --> 30:46.987
I'm already dead.

30:47.017 --> 30:49.782
Well, at least let me thank you.

30:54.434 --> 30:56.631
Do not mistake me helping your family

30:56.661 --> 31:00.448
with forgiveness for what you tried to do.

31:00.478 --> 31:02.333
My choice in this is the
only thing I have left,

31:02.363 --> 31:04.397
and no one is taking that away from me.

31:04.427 --> 31:06.331
you need to get that.

31:14.021 --> 31:16.642
Camille, I'm begging you.

31:18.543 --> 31:20.562
Don't leave me.

31:35.893 --> 31:37.212
I won't let her die.

31:37.242 --> 31:38.635
If you care for her,

31:38.665 --> 31:41.366
you will let her choose.

31:42.815 --> 31:44.496
I will not lose her because

31:44.526 --> 31:45.669
of your stupid principles.

31:45.699 --> 31:49.735
Allow her the dignity
of this choice, Niklaus.

31:49.765 --> 31:53.796
You force her, you lose her forever.

31:55.871 --> 31:58.179
We finish this.

32:03.131 --> 32:05.382
So this is to be my end.

32:06.969 --> 32:08.013
No, no.

32:10.487 --> 32:12.901
This is the very beginning.

32:14.514 --> 32:17.358
You are going to the bottom of the ocean,

32:17.589 --> 32:20.060
where you will drown in darkness

32:20.090 --> 32:22.365
again and again and again

32:22.395 --> 32:26.121
over the course of centuries.

32:26.151 --> 32:30.291
This will be your splendidly horrific

32:30.321 --> 32:33.051
and perpetual end.

32:35.667 --> 32:37.457
What have you done with my sister?

32:37.487 --> 32:38.897
Nothing...

32:38.927 --> 32:41.053
yet,

32:41.083 --> 32:43.149
but I assure you her death

32:43.179 --> 32:46.732
will be spectacular.

32:48.142 --> 32:49.444
Wait.

33:02.480 --> 33:07.185
You took a very good man from this world.

33:08.040 --> 33:11.294
He will be with me forever,

33:11.324 --> 33:16.628
but you... you will be forgotten...

33:17.597 --> 33:21.774
And as you rot in the ocean,

33:22.791 --> 33:25.470
remember my face.

33:30.128 --> 33:33.979
Because it's gonna be the
last one that you ever see.

33:56.480 --> 33:58.121
Got your text.

33:59.290 --> 34:01.077
It's a funny place to have a chat.

34:01.107 --> 34:03.492
Hmm. Hilarious.

34:03.693 --> 34:05.995
A dead girl leaving soon-to-be dead flowers

34:05.997 --> 34:07.568
at her dead brother's grave.

34:07.598 --> 34:12.134
It's just another pointless
ritual in a pointless life.

34:12.446 --> 34:14.804
I know what you're going through.

34:14.806 --> 34:16.389
I... look.

34:16.735 --> 34:18.678
As pointless as you think your life is,

34:18.708 --> 34:20.916
there are people out there
right now, right now...

34:20.946 --> 34:24.981
Davina, Kinney, hell, even Klaus...

34:24.983 --> 34:26.399
who know better.

34:34.016 --> 34:37.743
Well, you don't need to give me a speech.

34:37.745 --> 34:40.576
I called you here

34:41.705 --> 34:44.367
because you've been a friend,

34:44.683 --> 34:46.052
and I figured you wouldn't be judgey

34:46.081 --> 34:47.317
no matter what I choose.

34:47.347 --> 34:48.947
No way. I'm the last person to be judgey.

34:48.976 --> 34:51.956
My life is messed up as it is,

34:52.221 --> 34:54.260
but, uh, I will say this.

34:54.429 --> 34:57.127
As crazy as this world is with

34:57.157 --> 35:01.506
the monsters and the
lunatics running around,

35:01.536 --> 35:04.086
it's still a better place with you in it.

35:10.724 --> 35:13.713
You know, I did something today.

35:14.166 --> 35:20.353
I risked my life fighting
one of those monsters.

35:20.704 --> 35:22.213
It felt good.

35:22.243 --> 35:24.273
Yeah. I know that feeling.

35:24.510 --> 35:28.160
It's amazing what happens when
you stop fighting what you are.

35:32.233 --> 35:36.786
My uncle was really big
into doing the right thing,

35:37.137 --> 35:40.456
wanted to help the people, fix the city.

35:40.848 --> 35:43.042
Maybe...

35:43.469 --> 35:46.303
if I stuck around I could...

35:47.509 --> 35:50.913
continue what he did.

35:52.963 --> 35:57.256
If I was a vampire,

35:57.658 --> 36:00.810
I would have the strength
to make a difference.

36:05.559 --> 36:07.566
Of course, I would have to feed.

36:27.002 --> 36:29.157
Are you sure about this?

36:29.800 --> 36:31.590
Not in the slightest.

36:55.282 --> 36:58.797
Back inside enemy lines, huh?

36:59.360 --> 37:02.100
I hardly think we're enemies, Marcellus.

37:06.773 --> 37:09.641
I know where your loyalties lie.

37:10.064 --> 37:11.746
If I had know that they
were gonna go after Hayley,

37:11.776 --> 37:13.445
I would have warned you.

37:13.633 --> 37:14.758
I know.

37:16.271 --> 37:17.365
Thank you.

37:21.083 --> 37:23.371
And speaking of where things lie,

37:23.733 --> 37:26.323
what did you do with Tristan?

37:28.100 --> 37:31.609
Well, I persuaded some
rather dedicated longshoremen

37:31.639 --> 37:33.621
to release our little monster in a box

37:33.651 --> 37:35.073
to the deepest, darkest depths

37:35.103 --> 37:37.719
of I don't give a damn.

37:38.113 --> 37:42.423
Well, then to the devil
in the deep blue sea.

37:48.984 --> 37:51.232
How can Aurora be gone?

37:51.234 --> 37:54.396
Oh. Apologies I left your
lunatic ex unattended.

37:54.426 --> 37:57.248
See, I was busy casting the
spell that saved the day.

37:57.278 --> 37:59.396
The effort left me a little taxed.

37:59.722 --> 38:02.744
She was drugged to a stupor
and confined by your spell.

38:02.746 --> 38:04.146
Well, she couldn't have broken free

38:04.176 --> 38:06.056
of my barrier on her own.

38:06.086 --> 38:07.529
Either she was aided by a witch

38:07.559 --> 38:10.485
or someone who has access to dark objects.

38:12.783 --> 38:14.289
Lucien.

38:14.505 --> 38:17.959
He's the only one left who
would risk his life for Aurora.

38:36.157 --> 38:36.945
It's time.

40:24.921 --> 40:27.171
Till death do us part.

41:01.124 --> 41:02.819
Camille.

41:04.405 --> 41:07.462
I hope you don't mind.

41:07.660 --> 41:10.798
I helped myself to the
Mikaelson family blood stash.

41:13.565 --> 41:17.444
And how do you feel?

41:17.855 --> 41:19.524
I have to admit

41:19.977 --> 41:21.581
at first it felt strange,

41:22.000 --> 41:26.064
that... metallic taste,

41:26.066 --> 41:27.691
but then it was like electricity

41:27.721 --> 41:29.901
coursing through my body,

41:30.383 --> 41:33.680
a million stars exploding
in my mind all at once

41:33.710 --> 41:37.125
like nothing I have ever felt before.

41:40.747 --> 41:43.998
It was amazing,

41:44.000 --> 41:46.384
and all I can think now...

41:49.839 --> 41:51.973
is I want to do it again.
