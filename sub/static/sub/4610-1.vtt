00:55.920 --> 00:57.615
Onward, Ohauncey!

00:57.755 --> 01:00.349
To the highest room
of the tallest tower...

01:00.491 --> 01:05.588
...where my princess awaits rescue
from her handsome Prince Oharming!

01:16.941 --> 01:20.707
This is worse than "Love Leters".
I hate dinner theater!

01:20.845 --> 01:22.608
Me, too.

01:23.948 --> 01:25.939
Whoa there, Ohauncey!

01:27.351 --> 01:30.809
Hark! The brave Prince Oharming
approacheth.

01:30.955 --> 01:35.324
Fear not, fair maiden. I shall slay
the monster that guards you...

01:35.460 --> 01:38.395
...then take my place as rightful king.

01:38.529 --> 01:40.121
What did she say?

01:43.901 --> 01:45.300
It's Shrek!

01:45.570 --> 01:47.231
Whoo, Shrek, yeah!

01:49.474 --> 01:51.567
Prepare, foul beast...

01:51.709 --> 01:56.373
...to enter into a world of pain
with which you are not familiar!

01:56.514 --> 01:59.074
Happy birthday to thee
Happy birthday to thee

01:59.217 --> 02:00.479
Do you mind?

02:00.818 --> 02:03.981
Do you mind? Boring!

02:08.493 --> 02:10.824
Prepare, foul beast...

02:19.837 --> 02:22.533
Someday you'll be sorry.

02:22.673 --> 02:24.834
We already are!

02:49.967 --> 02:51.264
Mommy...

02:55.206 --> 02:58.698
You're right. I can't let this happen.

02:59.544 --> 03:00.875
I can't!

03:02.046 --> 03:05.812
I am the rightful King of Far Far Away.

03:05.950 --> 03:08.043
And I promise you this, Mother...

03:08.386 --> 03:11.116
...I will restore dignity to my throne.

03:15.726 --> 03:16.818
And this time,

03:16.961 --> 03:21.125
no one will stand in my way.

03:38.082 --> 03:39.743
Good morning.

03:40.751 --> 03:42.412
Good morning.

03:44.088 --> 03:45.112
Morning breath.

03:45.256 --> 03:48.419
I know. Isn't it wonderful?

03:49.093 --> 03:50.924
Good morning, good morning

03:51.596 --> 03:53.996
The sun is shining through

03:54.131 --> 03:56.326
Good morning, good morning
To you

03:56.467 --> 03:58.594
And you!
And you!

04:02.506 --> 04:04.201
They grow up so fast.

04:04.342 --> 04:06.435
Not fast enough.

04:08.512 --> 04:11.208
You'll be filling in
for the King and Queen.

04:11.349 --> 04:14.546
Several functions
require your atendance, sir.

04:14.685 --> 04:17.983
Great! Let's get started.

04:18.122 --> 04:20.954
Oome on, lazybones. Time to get moving!

04:21.791 --> 04:24.056
You need to get a pair ofjammies.

04:31.502 --> 04:34.733
I got some sleep and I needed it

04:34.872 --> 04:37.602
Not a lot, just a little bit

04:37.742 --> 04:40.836
Someone's always
trying to keep me from it

04:40.978 --> 04:43.811
It's a crying shame

04:44.482 --> 04:46.848
It's a royal pain in the neck

04:46.984 --> 04:48.645
I knight thee.

05:10.508 --> 05:13.636
If you're filling in for a king,
you should look like one.

05:13.778 --> 05:16.838
Oan somebody come in
and work on Shrek?

05:18.683 --> 05:20.173
I will see what I can do.

05:41.372 --> 05:43.033
Yeah, wow.

05:43.874 --> 05:46.365
Is this really necessary?

05:47.144 --> 05:48.805
Quite necessary, Fiona.

05:48.946 --> 05:51.744
- I'm Shrek, you twit.
- Whatever.

05:51.882 --> 05:55.579
This isn't a rehearsal, peoples.
Let's see some hustle!

05:55.720 --> 05:57.654
Smiles, everyone! Smiles!

05:57.788 --> 06:01.246
I don't know how much longer
I can keep this up.

06:01.392 --> 06:04.327
I'm sorry, but can you
just try to grin and bear it?

06:04.462 --> 06:06.487
It's just until Dad gets beter.

06:08.566 --> 06:09.897
Shrek?

06:11.235 --> 06:12.827
You look handsome.

06:12.970 --> 06:14.904
Oome here, you.

06:29.253 --> 06:33.917
My but is itching up a storm and
I can't reach it in this monkey suit.

06:34.759 --> 06:37.694
Hey, you! Oome here. What's your name?

06:37.828 --> 06:40.194
Fiddlesworth, sir.

06:40.331 --> 06:41.423
Perfect.

06:44.101 --> 06:46.467
Ladies and gentlemen...

06:46.604 --> 06:49.767
...Princess Fiona and Sir Shrek!

06:54.111 --> 06:55.874
Ahh! You've got it.

06:56.013 --> 06:57.537
A litle to the left.

06:58.783 --> 07:00.978
That's it! That's good.

07:01.118 --> 07:04.212
Oh, yeah! Scratch
that thing! You're on it.

07:04.355 --> 07:05.788
Shrek!

07:10.694 --> 07:11.820
My eye!

07:11.962 --> 07:13.122
What are you doing?

07:19.703 --> 07:20.692
Fiona!

07:23.808 --> 07:27.039
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

07:30.648 --> 07:32.980
Shrimp! My favorite!

07:43.494 --> 07:46.190
- That's it! We're leaving!
- Oalm down.

07:46.330 --> 07:51.267
Oalm down? Who do you think
we're kidding? I am an ogre.

07:51.402 --> 07:54.997
I'm not cut out for this, Fiona,
and I never will be.

07:59.076 --> 08:00.441
I think that went well.

08:00.578 --> 08:01.806
Donkey!

08:01.946 --> 08:03.675
Oome on, Shrek!

08:04.181 --> 08:07.412
Some people just don't
understand boundaries.

08:16.694 --> 08:21.290
Just think. A couple more days
and we'll be back home...

08:21.432 --> 08:24.731
...in our vermin-filled shack
strewn with fungus...

08:24.869 --> 08:27.770
...and filled with the stench
of mud and neglect.

08:27.905 --> 08:30.533
You had me at "vermin-filled".

08:31.375 --> 08:36.210
And, um... maybe even the piter-pater
of litle feet on the floor.

08:36.714 --> 08:39.409
That's right, the swamp rats
will be spawning.

08:39.549 --> 08:40.914
Uh, no.

08:41.051 --> 08:44.748
What I'm thinking of is a litle bigger
than a swamp rat.

08:44.889 --> 08:45.913
Donkey?

08:46.056 --> 08:49.719
No, Shrek. What if, theoretically...

08:50.995 --> 08:53.122
...they were litle ogre feet?

08:59.570 --> 09:02.937
Honey, let's be rational about this.

09:03.073 --> 09:05.439
Have you seen a baby lately?

09:05.576 --> 09:08.773
They just eat and poop, and they cry...

09:08.913 --> 09:12.280
...then they cry when they poop
and poop when they cry.

09:12.416 --> 09:15.214
Now, imagine an ogre baby.

09:15.352 --> 09:19.152
They extra-cry and they extra-poop.

09:19.290 --> 09:22.885
Shrek, don't you ever think
about having a family?

09:23.027 --> 09:26.588
Right now, you're my family.

09:30.601 --> 09:32.762
Somebody beter be dying.

09:34.705 --> 09:36.935
I'm dying.

09:39.276 --> 09:40.436
Harold?

09:42.613 --> 09:45.707
Don't forget
to pay the gardener, Lillian.

09:45.849 --> 09:47.783
Of course, darling.

09:49.520 --> 09:50.578
Fiona.

09:50.721 --> 09:52.245
Yes, Daddy?

09:52.389 --> 09:55.119
I know I made many mistakes with you.

09:56.126 --> 09:57.593
It's okay.

09:57.728 --> 09:59.855
But your love for Shrek has...

10:00.798 --> 10:02.197
...taught me much.

10:04.335 --> 10:06.326
My dear boy...

10:06.470 --> 10:09.735
...I am proud to call you my son.

10:09.873 --> 10:13.001
And I'm proud to call you my frog...

10:13.143 --> 10:15.577
...King dad-in-law.

10:15.713 --> 10:21.310
Now there is a mater
of business to atend to.

10:31.662 --> 10:34.654
The Frog King... is dead.

10:42.840 --> 10:44.808
Put your hat back on, fool.

10:44.942 --> 10:46.534
Shrek...

10:46.677 --> 10:48.338
...please come hither.

10:52.182 --> 10:53.547
Yeah, Dad?

10:53.684 --> 10:56.847
This kingdom needs a new king.

10:58.188 --> 11:02.852
You and Fiona
are next in line for the throne.

11:04.528 --> 11:08.726
Next in line. You see, Dad,
that's why people love you.

11:08.866 --> 11:12.199
Even on your deathbed,
you're still making jokes.

11:15.873 --> 11:19.570
Oome on, Dad. An ogre as king?

11:19.710 --> 11:22.235
That's not such a good idea.

11:22.379 --> 11:25.678
There must be somebody else. Anybody!

11:25.816 --> 11:31.015
Aside from you, there is
only one remaining heir.

11:31.155 --> 11:34.352
Really? Who is he, Dad?

11:34.491 --> 11:36.550
His name is...

11:37.928 --> 11:38.986
...is...

11:39.129 --> 11:40.756
What's his name?

11:40.898 --> 11:42.490
...is...

11:44.401 --> 11:45.493
Daddy!

12:02.753 --> 12:04.721
His name is Arthur.

12:04.855 --> 12:06.254
Arthur?

12:10.594 --> 12:13.791
I know you'll do...

12:13.931 --> 12:16.593
...what's right.

12:19.636 --> 12:20.967
Harold?

12:21.105 --> 12:22.663
Dad? Dad!

12:24.108 --> 12:25.336
Dad?

12:25.943 --> 12:27.535
Do your thing, man.

12:57.474 --> 13:01.342
When you were young and your heart

13:01.478 --> 13:03.639
Was an open book

13:05.649 --> 13:09.779
You used to say live and let live

13:09.920 --> 13:13.253
You know you did, you know you did
You know you did

13:14.057 --> 13:19.120
But if this ever changing world
In which we live in

13:19.997 --> 13:24.161
Makes you give in and cry

13:26.670 --> 13:28.831
Say live and let die

13:32.276 --> 13:33.937
Live and let die

14:10.447 --> 14:14.213
Hey, lady
You, lady

14:15.219 --> 14:17.380
Cursing at your life

14:18.055 --> 14:20.717
You're a discontented mother

14:22.392 --> 14:25.054
And a regimented wife

14:50.754 --> 14:53.917
What does a prince
have to do to get a drink here?

14:55.259 --> 14:56.954
Ah, Mabel!

14:57.094 --> 15:01.497
Why they call you an ugly stepsister,
I'll never know.

15:02.599 --> 15:05.693
Where's Doris? Taking the night off?

15:05.836 --> 15:09.602
She's not welcome here,
and neither are you.

15:11.275 --> 15:13.300
What do you want, Oharming?

15:13.443 --> 15:17.504
Not much. Just a chance at redemption.

15:19.116 --> 15:20.583
And a Fuzzy Navel.

15:20.717 --> 15:23.777
And Fuzzy Navels for all my friends!

15:28.225 --> 15:29.852
We're not your friends.

15:32.062 --> 15:34.189
You don't belong here.

15:34.331 --> 15:38.495
You're absolutely right,
but, I mean, do any of us?

15:38.635 --> 15:40.262
Do a number on his face.

15:40.404 --> 15:45.000
Wait, wait, wait!
We are more alike than you think.

15:45.142 --> 15:49.044
Wicked Witch! The Seven Dwarfs
saved Snow White, and what happened?

15:49.179 --> 15:50.271
Oh, what's it to you?

15:50.414 --> 15:52.678
They left you the unfairest of them all.

15:52.816 --> 15:57.344
Now here you are,
hustling pool to get your next meal.

15:57.487 --> 15:59.318
How does that feel?

16:04.795 --> 16:06.387
Prety unfair.

16:06.530 --> 16:07.929
And you!

16:08.065 --> 16:12.695
Your star puppet abandons the show
to go and find his father.

16:14.204 --> 16:16.297
I hate that litle wooden puppet.

16:16.440 --> 16:18.408
And Hook.

16:18.542 --> 16:20.134
Need I say more?

16:23.847 --> 16:26.611
- And you, Frumpypigskin!
- Rumpelstiltskin.

16:26.750 --> 16:29.378
Where's that firstborn
you were promised?

16:31.788 --> 16:35.690
Mabel. Remember how you
couldn't get your litle fat foot...

16:35.826 --> 16:37.726
...into that tiny glass slipper?

16:40.397 --> 16:43.924
Oinderella is
in Far Far Away right now...

16:44.067 --> 16:49.095
...eating bonbons, cavorting with
every last fairy tale creature...

16:49.239 --> 16:51.707
...that has ever done you wrong!

16:51.842 --> 16:56.779
Once upon a time, someone decided
that we were the losers.

16:56.913 --> 16:59.780
But there are
two sides to every story...

16:59.950 --> 17:02.475
...and our side has not been told!

17:02.619 --> 17:07.488
So who will join me? Who wants
to come out on top for once?

17:07.624 --> 17:09.285
Who wants their...

17:09.425 --> 17:12.589
..."happily ever after"?

17:29.780 --> 17:31.441
This way, gents.

17:42.793 --> 17:47.821
It's out of my hands, senorita. The
winds of fate have blown on my destiny.

17:47.964 --> 17:51.764
But I will never forget you.
You are the love of my life.

17:51.902 --> 17:54.336
As are you.

17:54.471 --> 17:56.837
And, uh, you.

17:56.973 --> 18:00.136
I don't know you, but I'd like to.

18:01.311 --> 18:02.642
I got to go!

18:04.047 --> 18:05.742
I don't wanna leave you either.

18:05.882 --> 18:08.715
But you know how Shrek is.
The dude's lost without me.

18:09.653 --> 18:12.986
But don't worry. I'll send you
airmail kisses every day!

18:14.324 --> 18:15.689
Be strong, babies.

18:15.826 --> 18:18.260
Ooco, Peanut, listen to your mama.

18:18.395 --> 18:22.388
Bananas, no roasting marshmallows
on your sister's head.

18:24.401 --> 18:26.028
That's my special boy!

18:26.169 --> 18:29.263
Oome here, all of you!
Give your daddy a big hug!

18:35.846 --> 18:37.177
Shrek?

18:38.181 --> 18:42.481
Maybe you should just stay and be King.

18:42.619 --> 18:46.146
Oome on. There's no way
I could run a kingdom.

18:46.289 --> 18:49.281
That's why your cousin Arthur
is a perfect choice.

18:49.426 --> 18:51.951
It's not that. You see...

18:52.095 --> 18:56.555
And if he gives me trouble,
I always have persuasion and reason.

18:56.700 --> 19:00.033
Here's persuasion... and here's reason.

19:02.439 --> 19:03.838
Fiona...

19:03.974 --> 19:07.239
...soon it's just going to be you, me...

19:07.377 --> 19:09.038
...and our swamp.

19:10.881 --> 19:13.372
It's not going to be just you and me.

19:14.651 --> 19:16.551
All aboard!

19:17.721 --> 19:20.554
It will be. I promise.

19:21.725 --> 19:23.215
I love you.

19:29.833 --> 19:31.494
That's lovely.

19:31.635 --> 19:33.227
Bye-bye, babies!

19:40.810 --> 19:42.004
Shrek!

19:43.246 --> 19:45.441
- Wait!
- What is it?

19:45.582 --> 19:47.072
I'm... I'm...

19:51.087 --> 19:52.952
I love you, too, honey!

19:53.089 --> 19:55.922
No! I said I'm...

19:58.929 --> 20:00.362
You're what?

20:00.497 --> 20:02.931
I said I'm pregnant!

20:07.103 --> 20:08.570
What was that?

20:08.705 --> 20:11.765
You're going to be a father!

20:13.610 --> 20:15.407
That's great!

20:15.545 --> 20:18.810
Really? I'm glad you think so!

20:18.949 --> 20:20.348
I love you!

20:20.483 --> 20:22.474
Yeah!

20:22.619 --> 20:24.951
Me, too! You!

20:28.825 --> 20:32.317
I'm going to be an uncle!
I'm going to be an uncle!

20:32.462 --> 20:35.522
And you, my friend, are royally...

21:14.237 --> 21:15.226
Home.

21:27.517 --> 21:28.848
Shrek!

21:31.187 --> 21:32.518
Fiona!

21:36.526 --> 21:37.857
Fiona?

21:57.080 --> 21:58.479
Oh, no.

22:01.651 --> 22:04.552
Beter out than in, I always say.

22:14.230 --> 22:15.561
No, no, no!

22:17.734 --> 22:20.294
It's okay. It's gonna be all right.

22:25.575 --> 22:27.736
Stop! Hey, wait!

23:17.127 --> 23:18.651
Donkey. Donkey!

23:18.795 --> 23:20.023
Wake up!

23:22.465 --> 23:23.796
Dada!

23:26.236 --> 23:28.227
Shrek! Are you okay?

23:29.973 --> 23:35.502
I can't believe I'm going to be
a father. How did this happen?

23:35.645 --> 23:39.843
Allow me to explain. When a man
has feelings for a woman...

23:39.983 --> 23:42.508
...a powerful urge sweeps over him.

23:42.652 --> 23:45.143
I know how it happened.

23:45.989 --> 23:48.048
I just can't believe it.

23:50.827 --> 23:52.658
How does it happen?

23:59.669 --> 24:04.936
And the cat's in the cradle
and the silver spoon

24:05.074 --> 24:07.702
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon

24:07.844 --> 24:10.438
When you coming home, son?
I don't know when

24:10.580 --> 24:12.878
But we'll get together then, Dad.

24:13.016 --> 24:15.007
Donkey! Oan you just cut to the part

24:15.151 --> 24:17.676
where you're supposed
to make me feel beter?

24:18.421 --> 24:20.946
You know I love Fiona, boss. Right?

24:21.090 --> 24:25.151
What I am talking about
is you, me, my cousin's boat...

24:25.295 --> 24:30.892
...an ice cold pitcher of mojitos
and two weeks of nothing but fishing.

24:31.034 --> 24:32.899
Don't listen to him!

24:33.036 --> 24:35.732
Having a baby
isn't going to ruin your life.

24:35.872 --> 24:40.400
It's not my life I'm worried
about ruining, it's the kid's.

24:40.543 --> 24:44.843
When have you ever heard the phrase
"as sweet as an ogre"...

24:44.981 --> 24:47.415
...or "as nurturing as an ogre"...

24:47.550 --> 24:51.919
...or "You'll love
my dad. He's a real ogre."

24:52.055 --> 24:53.818
Okay. I get it.

24:53.957 --> 24:57.415
It's not going to be easy.
But you got us to help you.

24:57.560 --> 24:59.255
That's true.

24:59.395 --> 25:00.862
I'm doomed.

25:00.997 --> 25:02.658
You'll be fine.

25:03.566 --> 25:05.466
You're finished.

25:07.737 --> 25:10.399
Uh, with yourjourney.

25:18.581 --> 25:23.018
"Wor-ces-ters-shiree"?
Now that sounds fancy!

25:23.152 --> 25:24.483
It's Worcestershire.

25:24.621 --> 25:26.452
Like the sauce?

25:26.589 --> 25:27.920
It's spicy!

25:31.761 --> 25:33.592
They must be expecting us.

25:39.502 --> 25:42.300
What in the shista-shire
kind of place is this?

25:42.438 --> 25:47.637
Well, my stomach aches and my palms
just got sweaty. Must be a high school.

25:47.777 --> 25:48.937
High school?

25:49.078 --> 25:50.636
Ready? Okay!

25:50.780 --> 25:53.214
Wherefore art thou headed, to the top?

25:53.349 --> 25:57.308
Yeah, we think so, we think so! And
dost thou thinkest thine can be stopped?

25:57.453 --> 25:59.921
Nay, we thinkst not, we thinkst not!

26:05.194 --> 26:09.187
All right, Mr. Percival,
ease up on the reins.

26:12.535 --> 26:16.232
For lo, bro, don't burn
all my frankincense and myrrh.

26:16.372 --> 26:19.864
I'm feeling nauseous from memories
of wedgies and swirlies!

26:20.009 --> 26:24.673
How did you receive wedgies when you are
clearly not the wearer of underpants?

26:24.814 --> 26:27.715
Let's just say some things
are beter left unsaid.

26:27.850 --> 26:31.911
So I was all like, "I'd rather get
the black plague than go out with you."

26:32.055 --> 26:34.387
- Oh, totally.
- Pardon me.

26:34.524 --> 26:37.322
- Totally ew-eth.
- Yeah, totally.

26:38.928 --> 26:41.522
I just altered my character level
to +3 superb-ability.

26:41.664 --> 26:44.224
Hi. We're looking for someone named...

26:44.367 --> 26:48.895
Who rolled a +9 dork spell and
summoned the beast and his quadruped?

26:50.740 --> 26:55.234
I know you're busy not fiting in, but
can you tell me where I can find Arthur?

26:55.378 --> 26:56.675
He's over there.

27:16.866 --> 27:21.269
There is no sweeter taste
on thy tongue than victory!

27:23.706 --> 27:26.573
Strong, handsome, face of a leader.

27:26.709 --> 27:30.042
Does Arthur look like a king or what?

27:31.214 --> 27:32.545
Sorry.

27:33.282 --> 27:35.910
Did you say you were looking for Arthur?

27:36.052 --> 27:38.486
That information is
on a need-to-know basis.

27:38.621 --> 27:40.316
It's top secret!

27:40.456 --> 27:44.051
Now, gentlemen, let's away.
To the showers!

27:46.562 --> 27:48.189
Greetings, Your Majesty.

27:48.331 --> 27:49.889
This is your lucky day.

27:50.733 --> 27:52.826
What are you supposed to be?

27:52.969 --> 27:56.234
Some kind of giant mutant leprechaun
or something?

27:57.240 --> 28:00.732
Giant mutant... You made a funny.

28:01.244 --> 28:03.178
Unhand me, monster!

28:03.312 --> 28:05.280
Stop squirming, Arthur.

28:05.415 --> 28:07.747
I'm not Arthur.

28:09.752 --> 28:12.277
I am Lancelot.

28:12.422 --> 28:15.084
That dork over there is Arthur.

28:21.164 --> 28:23.359
This is, like, totally embarrassing...

28:23.499 --> 28:26.093
...but Tiffany thinkest
thou vex her so soothly.

28:26.235 --> 28:29.636
She thought perchance thou would
ask her to the Homecoming Dance.

28:29.772 --> 28:30.864
Excuse me?

28:31.007 --> 28:34.943
Like, whatever. She's into college guys
and mythical creatures.

28:38.381 --> 28:40.474
Oh, Arthur...

28:40.616 --> 28:44.313
...come out, come out, wherever you are!

28:46.355 --> 28:48.983
You beter run,
you litle punk no-goodniks!

28:49.125 --> 28:52.526
The days of Donkey Dumpy Drawers
are over!

28:58.634 --> 28:59.965
Hold it.

29:00.636 --> 29:02.695
We're here for the mascot contest.

29:07.376 --> 29:10.573
We're here for the mascot contest, too.

29:10.713 --> 29:13.238
This is a costume?

29:13.382 --> 29:15.373
Worked on it all night long.

29:16.719 --> 29:18.516
Looks prety real to me.

29:18.654 --> 29:21.054
If he were real, could I do this?

29:22.725 --> 29:24.386
Or this?

29:25.661 --> 29:30.530
If it were real, that would have been
agonizingly painful.

29:30.666 --> 29:33.863
- Now watch this!
- That's quite enough, boys.

29:34.003 --> 29:37.803
Thank you to Professor Primbotom
and his lecture...

29:37.940 --> 29:39.339
...on "just say nay".

29:40.276 --> 29:44.542
And now, without further ado, let's give
a warm Worcestershire hoozah...

29:44.680 --> 29:48.172
...to the winner
of our mascot contest, the...

29:49.352 --> 29:50.341
...ogre?

29:52.421 --> 29:54.719
That's right. I'm the new mascot.

29:54.857 --> 29:58.486
So let's really try and beat
the other guys at...

29:58.628 --> 30:01.756
...whatever it is they're doing!

30:05.301 --> 30:08.293
This is all a bit unorthodox...

30:08.437 --> 30:12.100
Where can I find Arthur Pendragon?

30:14.377 --> 30:15.867
Hey, wait...

30:19.982 --> 30:21.609
Olassic.

30:21.751 --> 30:23.446
You should be ashamed of yourself!

30:23.586 --> 30:25.986
I didn't do it. They did.

30:30.793 --> 30:32.522
Please don't eat me.

30:32.662 --> 30:34.994
Eat him! Eat him! Eat him!

30:35.998 --> 30:38.660
I'm not here to eat him!

30:40.136 --> 30:42.764
Time to pack up
your toothbrush and jammies.

30:42.905 --> 30:45.135
You're the new King of Far Far Away.

30:45.274 --> 30:46.935
What?

30:48.477 --> 30:52.675
Artie a king?
More like the Mayor of Loserville!

30:57.420 --> 30:58.409
Burn.

31:02.024 --> 31:03.150
Is this for real?

31:03.292 --> 31:07.695
Absolutely. Olean out your locker, kid.
You have a kingdom to run.

31:07.830 --> 31:10.492
So, wait... l'm really the only heir?

31:11.834 --> 31:13.165
The one and only.

31:14.503 --> 31:16.164
Give me a second.

31:18.507 --> 31:20.168
My good people...

31:20.309 --> 31:23.039
...there's a lesson here for all of us.

31:23.179 --> 31:27.479
Next time you're about to dunk a kid's
head in a chamber pot, stop and think,

31:27.617 --> 31:30.108
"Hey, maybe this guy has feelings.

31:30.853 --> 31:33.219
Maybe I should cut him some slack.

31:33.356 --> 31:36.723
'Oause maybe... just maybe...

31:36.859 --> 31:40.556
...this guy's gonna turn out to be,
I don't know, a king?

31:40.696 --> 31:45.724
Maybe his first royal decree will be to
banish everyone who ever picked on him."

31:45.868 --> 31:48.735
I'm looking at you, jousting team!

31:49.071 --> 31:52.268
And Guin? Oh, Guin.

31:53.142 --> 31:54.473
I've always loved you.

31:56.345 --> 31:58.905
Good friends, it breaks my heart, but...

31:59.048 --> 32:02.540
...enjoy your stay here in prison
while I rule the free world!

32:02.685 --> 32:04.277
Okay, let's not overdo it.

32:04.420 --> 32:07.753
I'm building my city, people...
on rock 'n' roll!

32:07.890 --> 32:09.755
You just overdid it.

32:18.901 --> 32:20.528
Look at you!

32:20.670 --> 32:22.194
You look darling.

32:22.338 --> 32:24.533
Just precious. Look at her.

32:24.674 --> 32:27.040
Any cravings since you got pregnant?

32:27.176 --> 32:29.804
No. Not at all.

32:30.646 --> 32:32.375
Do you smell ham?

32:32.515 --> 32:35.643
It's present time!

32:37.520 --> 32:41.581
Fiona, please open mine first.
It's the one in front.

32:41.724 --> 32:46.354
"Oongratulations on your new
mess mak..." Oh, mess maker!

32:46.495 --> 32:49.487
"Hopefully this helps.
Love, Oinderella."

32:50.833 --> 32:52.494
- Look at that!
- What is it?

32:54.070 --> 32:56.538
It's for the poopies.

32:56.672 --> 32:58.230
Wait... babies poop?

32:58.374 --> 32:59.705
Everyone poops, Beauty.

32:59.842 --> 33:01.309
Fiona!

33:01.444 --> 33:04.277
We all chipped in
for a litle present, too.

33:05.181 --> 33:06.739
Ta-da!

33:07.950 --> 33:10.783
You know the baby will love it,
because I do!

33:10.920 --> 33:13.889
Guys, that's so sweet. Thank you.

33:14.023 --> 33:15.422
Who's this one from?

33:15.558 --> 33:18.493
I got you the biggest one,
because I love you most.

33:18.627 --> 33:21.687
"Have one on me. Love, Snow White."

33:24.533 --> 33:26.160
What is it?

33:26.302 --> 33:27.826
He's a live-in babysiter.

33:27.970 --> 33:29.062
Where's the baby?

33:29.205 --> 33:33.266
You're too kind, Snow,
but I can't accept this.

33:33.409 --> 33:35.775
It's nothing. I have six more at home.

33:35.911 --> 33:37.674
- What does he do?
- Oleaning.

33:37.813 --> 33:39.405
- Feeding.
- Burping.

33:39.548 --> 33:42.016
So, what are
Shrek and I supposed to do?

33:42.151 --> 33:44.278
Work on your marriage.

33:44.420 --> 33:48.288
Thanks, Rapunzel.
What's that supposed to mean?

33:48.424 --> 33:52.451
Oome on now, Fiona.
You know what happens.

33:53.396 --> 33:55.421
You're tired all the time.

33:55.564 --> 33:57.293
You start leting yourself go.

33:57.433 --> 33:58.593
Stretch marks.

33:58.734 --> 34:00.065
Say goodbye to romance.

34:02.405 --> 34:05.841
I'm sorry, but how many
of you have kids?

34:05.975 --> 34:07.533
She's right!

34:07.676 --> 34:12.112
A baby will only strengthen the love
Shrek and Fiona have.

34:12.248 --> 34:15.081
How did Shrek react when you told him?

34:16.252 --> 34:19.415
When he first found out, Shrek said...

34:32.268 --> 34:36.601
Onward, my new friends!
To our happily ever afters!

34:42.277 --> 34:44.438
Now... bombs away!

35:00.963 --> 35:03.830
Well, well, well. If it isn't Peter Pan.

35:03.966 --> 35:06.434
- His name's not Peter.
- Shut it, Wendy.

35:24.987 --> 35:28.650
Enough pillaging! To the castle!

35:47.009 --> 35:48.476
You go! Take care of the baby!

35:48.611 --> 35:51.774
Everybody stay calm! We're going to die!

35:56.185 --> 35:58.312
Everyone in! Now!

35:58.454 --> 36:00.581
Oome on! Put some back into it!

36:03.926 --> 36:05.416
We don't have time. Now go!

36:05.561 --> 36:07.358
Quickly, ladies!

36:09.632 --> 36:11.190
We'll hold them off as long as we can!

36:26.882 --> 36:29.282
Where are Shrek and Fiona?

36:29.418 --> 36:31.579
The name doesn't ring a bell.

36:31.720 --> 36:33.415
No bell.

36:33.556 --> 36:36.923
I suggest you freaks cooperate...

36:37.059 --> 36:39.653
...with the new King of Far Far Away!

36:39.795 --> 36:43.492
The only thing you're ever gonna
be king of is King of the Stupids!

36:43.632 --> 36:45.930
- Hook!
- Right!

36:46.068 --> 36:48.298
Avast, ye cookie.

36:50.906 --> 36:52.567
Start talking.

36:56.946 --> 36:58.436
- Gingy!
- Papa!

36:58.581 --> 36:59.946
Setle down now.

37:13.929 --> 37:17.228
On the good ship Lollipop

37:17.366 --> 37:20.802
It's a sweet trip to the candy shop

37:20.936 --> 37:21.925
You!

37:22.771 --> 37:24.966
You can't lie.

37:25.107 --> 37:28.770
So tell me, puppet... where is Shrek?

37:31.780 --> 37:35.011
Well... I don't know where he's not.

37:35.150 --> 37:37.345
You don't know where Shrek is?

37:37.486 --> 37:40.080
It wouldn't be inaccurate to assume...

37:40.222 --> 37:44.488
...that I couldn't exactly not say that
is or isn't almost partially incorrect.

37:44.627 --> 37:45.992
So you do know where he is!

37:46.128 --> 37:48.653
On the contrary,
I'm possibly more or less

37:48.797 --> 37:51.027
not definitely rejecting the idea

37:51.166 --> 37:54.829
that in no way,
with any amount of uncertainty...

37:54.970 --> 37:55.959
Stop it!

37:56.105 --> 37:58.232
...I do not know where he shouldn't be.

37:58.374 --> 38:00.842
If that indeed wasn't where he isn't.

38:00.976 --> 38:04.571
Even if he wasn't not where
I knew he was, it could mean...

38:04.713 --> 38:06.943
On the good ship Lollipop

38:07.082 --> 38:11.485
Enough! Shrek went off
to bring back the next heir!

38:14.490 --> 38:16.287
He's bringing back the next heir?

38:16.425 --> 38:17.915
No!

38:19.161 --> 38:22.358
Hook! Get rid of this new "King".

38:22.498 --> 38:24.363
But bring Shrek to me.

38:24.500 --> 38:27.697
I have something special
in mind for him.

38:27.836 --> 38:29.997
He'll never fall for your tricks!

38:31.674 --> 38:33.335
Oh, boy.

38:43.185 --> 38:46.211
I can't believe it. Me, a king?

38:46.355 --> 38:49.381
I knew I came from royalty, but...

38:49.525 --> 38:51.618
...I figured everyone forgot about me.

38:51.760 --> 38:55.491
Oh, no. In fact the King
asked for you personally.

38:55.631 --> 38:58.191
Really? Wow.

38:59.535 --> 39:01.765
But I know it's not all fun and games.

39:01.904 --> 39:04.896
It really is
all fun and games, actually.

39:05.040 --> 39:08.635
Sure, you have to knight a few heroes,
launch a ship or two.

39:08.777 --> 39:13.111
By the way, make sure you hit the boat
just right with the botle.

39:13.248 --> 39:16.046
Any idiot can hit a boat with a botle.

39:16.885 --> 39:19.820
Well, I've heard
it's harder than it looks.

39:19.955 --> 39:21.923
This is going to be huge.

39:22.057 --> 39:26.926
Parties, princesses,
castles. Princesses.

39:27.062 --> 39:29.929
You'll be living in the lap of luxury.

39:30.065 --> 39:32.533
The finest chefs
will wait for your order.

39:32.668 --> 39:35.637
And fortunately,
you'll have the royal food tasters.

39:35.771 --> 39:37.466
What do they do?

39:37.606 --> 39:42.202
Taste the food before the King eats,
to make sure it's not poisoned.

39:42.344 --> 39:44.938
- Poisoned?
- Or too salty.

39:45.080 --> 39:48.607
Don't worry. Your bodyguards
will keep you safe.

39:48.751 --> 39:51.015
All of them willing
at a moment's notice

39:51.153 --> 39:53.986
to lay down their lives
out of devotion to you.

39:54.123 --> 39:55.556
Really?

39:55.691 --> 39:58.717
The whole kingdom will look
to you for wisdom and guidance.

39:59.094 --> 40:01.028
Make sure they don't die of famine!

40:01.163 --> 40:02.892
- Or plague.
- Plague is bad.

40:03.031 --> 40:05.932
The coughing, the groaning,
the festering sores.

40:07.503 --> 40:11.940
Festering sores!
You are one funny kity cat.

40:12.608 --> 40:14.007
What did I say?

40:14.143 --> 40:16.509
We don't want Artie
geting the wrong idea.

40:17.279 --> 40:18.439
Artie?

40:22.718 --> 40:24.481
There goes my hip!

40:24.620 --> 40:26.781
Artie! What are you doing?

40:28.724 --> 40:30.851
What does it look like?!

40:33.529 --> 40:35.997
This really isn't up to you.

40:36.131 --> 40:38.998
I don't know anything about being king!

40:39.134 --> 40:41.068
You'll learn on the job!

40:42.971 --> 40:45.496
Sorry, but I'm going back.

40:45.641 --> 40:48.075
Back to what? Being a loser?

40:51.647 --> 40:53.205
Now look what you did!

40:53.982 --> 40:57.816
Look what I did?
_
Who's holding the wheel, chief?

40:58.821 --> 41:00.311
Shrek!

41:12.668 --> 41:14.659
Land ho!

41:27.182 --> 41:29.013
How humiliating.

41:30.018 --> 41:32.953
Oh, nice going, Your Highness.

41:33.088 --> 41:36.785
Now it's "Your Highness"?
What happened to "loser"?

41:36.925 --> 41:39.826
If you think this is geting you
out of anything, it isn't.

41:39.962 --> 41:43.728
We're heading back to Far Far Away
one way or another...

41:43.866 --> 41:46.300
...and you're going to be a father!

41:46.435 --> 41:47.868
What?

41:48.704 --> 41:50.262
You just said "father".

41:50.405 --> 41:53.135
King! You're going to be king!

41:53.275 --> 41:56.267
"You're going to be king!" Yeah, right.

41:57.479 --> 41:58.912
Where are you going?

41:59.047 --> 42:01.515
Far Far Away... from you!

42:01.650 --> 42:03.618
Get back here, young man!

42:05.587 --> 42:08.078
Boss? I don't think he's coming back.

42:08.223 --> 42:11.420
Maybe it's for the best.
He's not exactly king material.

42:11.560 --> 42:14.791
When did you plan to tell him
you were supposed to be king?

42:14.930 --> 42:17.763
Oome on. Why would I do that?

42:17.900 --> 42:20.960
Besides, he'll be ten times
beter at it than me.

42:21.103 --> 42:25.062
Then change your tactics
if you want to get anywhere with him.

42:27.409 --> 42:29.240
You're right, Donkey.

42:31.580 --> 42:33.104
What about this?

42:33.248 --> 42:37.082
- Shrek!
- Oome on. It's just a joke.

42:38.654 --> 42:39.985
Still...

42:56.772 --> 42:58.433
Listen, Artie.

42:59.007 --> 43:04.138
If you think this whole mad scene
ain't dope, I feel you, dude.

43:04.279 --> 43:08.409
I'm not trying to get up in your grill
or raise your roof.

43:08.550 --> 43:10.677
But what I am screamin' is, yo...

43:10.819 --> 43:14.016
...check out this
kazing thazing, bazaby!

43:14.156 --> 43:16.249
If it doesn't groove, or what I'm saying

43:16.391 --> 43:19.326
ain't straight trippin',
say, "Oh, no, you didn't!

43:19.461 --> 43:21.895
You're geting on my last nerve."

43:22.030 --> 43:25.022
And then I'll know it's...
I'll know it's wack!

43:26.635 --> 43:27.829
Help!

43:27.970 --> 43:31.371
I've been kidnapped by a monster
who's trying to relate to me!

43:31.506 --> 43:35.135
- Artie, wait.
- Oome on! Help! Hello?

43:36.645 --> 43:40.342
Greetings, cosmic children
of the universe.

43:40.482 --> 43:42.416
Welcome to my serenity circle.

43:42.551 --> 43:46.681
Please leave any bad vibes
outside the healing vortex.

43:46.822 --> 43:48.653
Now prepare to...

43:54.329 --> 43:57.162
I knew I should have got that warranty!

44:00.068 --> 44:01.535
Mr. Merlin?

44:01.670 --> 44:03.137
You know this guy?

44:03.271 --> 44:07.537
Yeah. He was the school magic teacher,
until he had his nervous breakdown.

44:07.676 --> 44:11.043
Technically, I was merely a victim
of a level 3 fatigue.

44:11.179 --> 44:13.272
At the request of my therapist,

44:13.415 --> 44:17.044
and the school authorities, I retired
to the tranquility of nature

44:17.185 --> 44:19.346
to discover my divine purpose.

44:20.856 --> 44:24.257
Oan I interest anyone
in a snack or beverage?

44:24.393 --> 44:25.485
Uh, no.

44:25.627 --> 44:28.960
Sure you don't want to try
my Rock Au Gratin?

44:31.867 --> 44:33.334
It's organic.

44:33.468 --> 44:35.902
Thanks. I ate a boulder on the way in.

44:36.038 --> 44:38.973
We need directions to Far Far Away.

44:39.107 --> 44:41.632
"We"? Who said I was going with you?

44:41.777 --> 44:46.146
I did. People are counting on you,
so don't try to weasel out of it.

44:46.281 --> 44:48.340
If the job's so great, you do it.

44:48.884 --> 44:53.150
Understand this, kid. No more
Mr. Nice Guy from here on out.

44:53.288 --> 44:55.586
That was your Mr. Nice Guy?

44:55.724 --> 44:57.658
Yeah, and I'm going to miss him.

44:57.793 --> 45:02.196
Why don't you go terrorize a village
and leave me alone!

45:02.330 --> 45:06.858
Was that a crack about ogres? You get
your royal highness to Far Far Away...

45:07.002 --> 45:11.029
...before I kick it there!
Now, which way am I kicking?

45:11.173 --> 45:13.004
I could tell you, but since you're

45:13.141 --> 45:15.666
in the midst
of a self-destructive rage spiral,

45:15.811 --> 45:18.336
it would be karmically irresponsible.

45:18.480 --> 45:22.143
Self-destructive?
Are you going to help us or not?

45:22.284 --> 45:24.878
Most definitely, but only after you

45:25.020 --> 45:28.217
take the journey to your soul!

45:28.356 --> 45:29.721
I don't think so.

45:29.858 --> 45:33.692
It's either that
or primal scream therapy.

45:35.764 --> 45:38.426
All right. Journey to the soul.

45:39.267 --> 45:41.132
Now, all of you,

45:41.269 --> 45:43.794
look into the Fire of Truth

45:43.939 --> 45:46.931
and tell me what you see.

45:49.778 --> 45:51.643
Ooh, charades!

45:51.780 --> 45:56.547
Okay, I see a Dutch fudge torte
with cinnamon swirls!

45:56.685 --> 45:59.279
Okay, monster... go for it.

46:07.963 --> 46:09.658
I see a rainbow pony.

46:09.798 --> 46:11.732
Excellent work! Now the boy.

46:11.867 --> 46:13.334
This is lame.

46:13.468 --> 46:15.732
You're lame! Now just go for it.

46:17.305 --> 46:18.636
Okay.

46:19.474 --> 46:23.911
There's a baby bird and a father bird
siting in a nest.

46:24.045 --> 46:26.036
Yes! Stay with it!

46:26.882 --> 46:30.875
The dad just flew away. Why did
he leave the litle bird all alone?

46:31.553 --> 46:34.989
It's trying to fly,
but it doesn't know how to.

46:35.891 --> 46:38.052
It's going to fall!

46:42.898 --> 46:46.891
Proper head case you are.
Really messed up.

46:50.238 --> 46:55.232
Okay, I get it. The bird's me.
My dad left. So what?

47:07.255 --> 47:09.917
Look, Artie, um...

47:14.262 --> 47:17.026
Just thought I'd help set the mood...

47:17.165 --> 47:20.498
...for your big heart-to-heart chat.

47:28.944 --> 47:32.277
I know what it's like
to not feel ready for something.

47:34.616 --> 47:36.948
Even ogres get scared.

47:37.786 --> 47:40.619
You know... once in a while.

47:42.624 --> 47:46.390
I know you want me
to be king, but I can't.

47:46.528 --> 47:49.395
I'm not cut out for it,
and I never will be.

47:50.298 --> 47:52.789
Even my own dad knew
I wasn't worth the trouble.

47:52.934 --> 47:56.131
He dumped me at that school
first chance he got...

47:56.805 --> 47:59.137
...and I never heard from him again.

48:00.809 --> 48:04.643
My dad wasn't really
the fatherly type, either.

48:05.146 --> 48:07.307
I doubt he was worse than mine.

48:08.149 --> 48:09.446
Oh, yeah?

48:09.584 --> 48:13.645
My father was an ogre.
He tried to eat me.

48:14.489 --> 48:16.684
I guess I should have realized it.

48:16.825 --> 48:21.091
He bathed me in barbecue sauce and
put me to bed with an apple in my mouth.

48:22.998 --> 48:25.489
I guess that's prety bad.

48:27.836 --> 48:30.031
It may be hard to believe,

48:30.171 --> 48:33.629
what, with my obvious charm
and good looks,

48:33.775 --> 48:36.710
but people used
to think I was a monster.

48:36.845 --> 48:40.508
And for a long time, I believed them.

48:42.517 --> 48:44.109
But after a while,

48:44.252 --> 48:47.779
you learn to ignore
the names people call you

48:47.923 --> 48:50.255
and just trust who you are.

48:52.360 --> 48:55.523
You know... you're okay, Shrek.

48:56.364 --> 48:59.925
You just need to do a litle less
yelling and use a litle more soap.

49:01.269 --> 49:02.896
Thanks, Artie.

49:03.038 --> 49:06.701
The soap's because
you stink... really bad.

49:07.876 --> 49:10.367
Yeah... I got that.

49:14.382 --> 49:17.249
This place is filthy!

49:17.552 --> 49:19.144
I feel like a hobo.

49:20.388 --> 49:23.152
I'm sorry, but this
isn't working for me.

49:23.291 --> 49:27.853
Everything's always about you.
It's not like your atitude is helping.

49:27.996 --> 49:31.693
Maybe itjust bothers you
I was voted fairest in the land.

49:31.833 --> 49:33.926
You mean in that rigged election?

49:34.069 --> 49:37.038
Give me a break. "Rapunzel, Rapunzel...

49:37.172 --> 49:40.300
...let down thy golden extensions!"

49:40.442 --> 49:45.243
Ladies, let go of your pety complaints
and let's work together!

49:48.216 --> 49:51.208
So I guess the plan is
we just wander aimlessly

49:51.353 --> 49:53.446
in this stinkhole until we rot.

49:53.588 --> 49:57.115
No, we get inside and find out
what Oharming's up to.

49:57.258 --> 49:59.954
I know he's a jerk and everything,

50:00.095 --> 50:04.259
but that Oharming
makes me hoter than July.

50:05.600 --> 50:06.931
That's it!

50:34.963 --> 50:37.329
Oome on! This way!

50:37.465 --> 50:38.454
Rapunzel, wait!

50:47.976 --> 50:49.807
Oharming, let go of her.

50:49.944 --> 50:52.572
But why would I want to do that?

50:58.119 --> 50:59.108
What?

50:59.254 --> 51:04.351
Say hello, ladies,
to the new Queen of Far Far Away.

51:08.363 --> 51:10.160
Rapunzel, how could you?

51:10.298 --> 51:12.562
Jealous much?

51:12.700 --> 51:15.134
Soon you'll be back
where you started,

51:15.270 --> 51:17.898
scrubbing floors
or locked away in towers.

51:18.039 --> 51:21.668
That is, if I let you last the week.

51:23.978 --> 51:26.572
Pookie, you promised not to hurt them.

51:26.714 --> 51:30.707
Not here, kiten whiskers.
Daddy will discuss it later.

51:31.453 --> 51:33.978
Now forgive us.
We have a show to put on.

51:34.122 --> 51:37.387
Shrek will be back soon,
and you'll be sorry.

51:37.525 --> 51:38.924
Sorry?!

51:39.060 --> 51:43.326
Don't you realize once Shrek
sets foot in Far Far Away...

51:43.465 --> 51:45.228
...he's doomed?

52:24.772 --> 52:26.399
Look out! They got a piano!

52:26.541 --> 52:29.908
Kill them all... except the fat one.

52:30.044 --> 52:34.413
King Oharming has something special
in mind for you, ogre.

52:34.549 --> 52:35.846
King Oharming?

52:35.984 --> 52:37.008
Atack!

52:43.291 --> 52:44.451
Artie, duck!

52:59.007 --> 53:00.269
Ready the plank!

53:15.990 --> 53:17.651
- Shrek!
- Help!

53:36.978 --> 53:38.275
Oowards!

53:38.413 --> 53:40.779
What has Oharming done with Fiona?

53:40.915 --> 53:43.509
She's going to get what's coming to her.

53:44.085 --> 53:48.988
And there ain't nothing
you can do to stop him!

53:49.123 --> 53:51.648
- We've got to save her.
- But she's so far far away!

53:52.594 --> 53:54.892
Get yourself back
to Worcestershire, kid.

53:55.029 --> 53:58.521
No, Shrek. Hold on. I've got an idea.

53:58.666 --> 54:00.930
I am a buzzing bee.

54:01.603 --> 54:04.800
Mr. Merlin?
They need a spell to get them...

54:04.939 --> 54:07.965
...I mean us, back to Far Far Away.

54:08.109 --> 54:11.545
Forget it. I don't have that kind
of magic in me anymore.

54:11.679 --> 54:15.376
How about a hug?
That's the best kind of magic.

54:15.516 --> 54:17.882
Please. I know you can do it.

54:18.019 --> 54:19.816
I said forget it!

54:19.954 --> 54:21.285
But...

54:28.696 --> 54:30.288
What's with you?

54:31.633 --> 54:34.796
It's just so hard, you know?

54:35.470 --> 54:39.600
They need to get back,
'cause their kingdom's in trouble.

54:39.741 --> 54:42.266
'Oause there's a really bad man.

54:42.410 --> 54:44.173
It's just so hard!

54:44.312 --> 54:46.439
Take it easy.

54:46.581 --> 54:49.948
No! I don't think you understand!

54:50.084 --> 54:54.612
There's a mean person doing
mean things to good people.

54:54.756 --> 54:56.451
Have a heart, old man.

54:56.591 --> 55:00.755
They really need your help to get back.
Why won't you help them?!

55:04.599 --> 55:06.191
Okay.

55:06.334 --> 55:08.325
I'll go get my things.

55:11.105 --> 55:12.299
Piece of cake.

55:12.440 --> 55:15.967
Well, well. You want eggs with that ham?

55:16.110 --> 55:19.807
I am a litle rusty, so there
could be some side effects.

55:19.947 --> 55:21.414
- Side effects?
- Don't worry.

55:21.549 --> 55:25.315
Whatever it is, no mater
how excruciatingly painful,

55:25.453 --> 55:28.616
it will wear off eventually. I think.

55:30.591 --> 55:32.821
- Oops.
- You sure about this?

55:32.960 --> 55:37.090
If Artie trusts him,
that's good enough for me.

55:37.231 --> 55:39.096
Even if his robe doesn't cover...

55:39.233 --> 55:41.758
Alacritious expeditious...

55:41.903 --> 55:44.599
...a- zoomy-zoom-zoom!

55:44.739 --> 55:47.572
Let's help our friends get back...

55:50.311 --> 55:51.642
...soon!

55:58.986 --> 56:00.578
It worked!

56:09.297 --> 56:12.323
I haven't been on a trip
like that since college!

56:12.767 --> 56:14.029
Donkey?

56:14.168 --> 56:17.001
What? Is something in my teeth?

56:19.440 --> 56:24.434
Oh, no! I've been abracadabra-ed into
a Fancy Feastin', second-rate sidekick!

56:26.781 --> 56:30.842
At least you don't look
like some kind of bloated piñata!

56:30.985 --> 56:33.044
You should think about going on a diet!

56:33.187 --> 56:37.783
You should get yourself a pair of pants.
I feel all exposed and nasty!

56:39.460 --> 56:41.792
So you two think this is funny?

56:44.298 --> 56:46.095
I'm really sorry, guys.

56:46.234 --> 56:48.702
Don't be. You got us back, kid.

56:54.375 --> 56:56.502
How in the Hans Ohristian Andersen

56:56.644 --> 56:59.408
am I supposed to parade around
in these goofy boots?

56:59.547 --> 57:02.380
Hey, hey, hey!
Be very careful with those.

57:03.818 --> 57:07.151
They were made in Madrid
by the finest...

57:07.822 --> 57:09.813
You'll learn to control that.

57:12.727 --> 57:17.721
Seriously. Ow! You need some comfort
inserts or arch supports or something.

57:23.905 --> 57:28.774
Watch it. I'm walking here
and I'm gonna keep going until...

57:28.910 --> 57:30.002
Pinocchio!

57:30.745 --> 57:32.770
Shrek! Help me!

57:32.914 --> 57:36.111
- What happened?
- Oharming and the villains took over!

57:36.250 --> 57:40.016
Fiona and the Princesses got away.
Now she's...

57:40.154 --> 57:41.678
She's what?! What?!

57:44.025 --> 57:45.856
Puss! Loan me five bucks.

57:45.993 --> 57:48.223
You heard him. Help the brother out.

57:48.362 --> 57:50.455
Do you see any pockets on me?

57:50.598 --> 57:52.429
Hold on a second.

57:54.936 --> 57:59.100
I had no idea, really. I... I swear.

58:00.274 --> 58:02.469
Quick! Where is Fiona?

58:02.610 --> 58:06.376
Oharming has her locked away
someplace. You have to find him!

58:06.514 --> 58:09.381
He's probably geting ready
for the show!

58:09.517 --> 58:11.849
Wait, Pinocchio! What show?

58:16.858 --> 58:19.258
"It's a Happily Ever After After All".

58:19.393 --> 58:21.725
"Shrek's final performance"?

58:21.863 --> 58:25.993
Shrek! You didn't tell us
you were in a play!

58:26.133 --> 58:29.591
I guess I've been so busy
I forgot to mention it.

58:29.737 --> 58:31.295
The ogre! Get him!

58:32.640 --> 58:34.972
Don't worry, jefe. I got this.

58:41.516 --> 58:43.143
Uck! Kill it!

58:44.151 --> 58:49.282
Look. Don't you know who
he thinks he is? How dare you!

58:49.423 --> 58:50.947
We're dealing with amateurs.

58:51.092 --> 58:56.029
He's a star, people! Hello?
I'm so sorry about this, Mr. Shrek.

58:56.163 --> 58:57.687
I'm going to lose it!

58:57.832 --> 59:01.632
Is everything ready? You did get
the list for the dressing room?

59:01.769 --> 59:04.863
Breakfast croissant stuffed
with seared sashimi tuna.

59:05.006 --> 59:08.305
And I hope you have the saffron corn
with jalapeno honey buter.

59:08.442 --> 59:11.434
Our client cannot get
into his proper emotional state

59:11.579 --> 59:13.376
withoutjalapeno honey buter!

59:13.514 --> 59:14.913
I just lost it.

59:15.683 --> 59:18.208
They should talk to Nancy
in Human Resources.

59:18.352 --> 59:21.844
Oh, we will have much to say
to Nancy, I promise!

59:23.524 --> 59:27.221
"With this sword, I do..." No. "With..."

59:27.361 --> 59:31.024
"With this sword, I do smote thee!"

59:31.933 --> 59:34.401
Is "smote" the right word? "Smoot"?

59:34.535 --> 59:36.400
I don't think that's a word.

59:36.537 --> 59:40.871
Maybe I should just "smite" him.
Let's try this again. Now...

59:42.043 --> 59:45.206
Shrek atacks me.
I pretend to be afraid.

59:45.947 --> 59:50.350
"Now the kingdom will get the happily
ever after they deserve. Die, ogre!"

59:50.484 --> 59:54.147
Blah, blah, blah. Oh,
itjust doesn't feel real enough!

59:56.057 --> 59:58.082
Who told you to stop dancing?!

59:58.225 --> 59:59.692
Wink and turn.

59:59.827 --> 01:00:03.058
What are you laying around for?
Get up! Honestly!

01:00:11.739 --> 01:00:14.936
Our happily ever after
is nearly complete, Mummy.

01:00:15.076 --> 01:00:17.271
And I assure you...

01:00:17.411 --> 01:00:22.405
...the people of this kingdom
will pay dearly for every second...

01:00:23.584 --> 01:00:25.245
...we've had to wait.

01:00:26.854 --> 01:00:28.287
Break a leg.

01:00:28.422 --> 01:00:31.186
On second thought,
let me break it for you.

01:00:31.325 --> 01:00:35.625
Thank goodness. I was afraid
you wouldn't get back in time.

01:00:35.763 --> 01:00:37.390
Where's Fiona?

01:00:37.531 --> 01:00:41.763
Don't worry. She and the others
are safe... for now.

01:00:50.945 --> 01:00:54.278
Let me guess. Arthur.

01:00:54.949 --> 01:00:56.974
It's Artie, actually.

01:00:57.118 --> 01:01:02.112
This boy is supposed to be
the new King of Far Far Away?

01:01:04.025 --> 01:01:05.322
How pathetic.

01:01:05.459 --> 01:01:08.326
Stand still, so I won't make a mess.

01:01:08.462 --> 01:01:11.898
Oharming, stop! I'm here now.
You got what you wanted.

01:01:12.033 --> 01:01:13.694
This isn't about him.

01:01:14.468 --> 01:01:18.802
Then who's it about?
I'm supposed to be king, right?

01:01:20.141 --> 01:01:24.510
You weren't really next in line
for the throne.

01:01:24.645 --> 01:01:26.044
I was.

01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:29.513
But you said the King
asked for me personally.

01:01:29.650 --> 01:01:31.481
Not exactly.

01:01:31.619 --> 01:01:33.052
What does that mean?

01:01:33.187 --> 01:01:35.678
I said whatever I had to say, all right?

01:01:35.823 --> 01:01:39.520
I wasn't right for the job,
so I needed some fool to replace me.

01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:43.323
And you fit the bill. So just go!

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:48.459
You were playing me the whole time.

01:01:48.602 --> 01:01:50.365
You catch on real fast, kid.

01:01:50.504 --> 01:01:53.598
Maybe you're not
as big of a loser as I thought.

01:02:00.014 --> 01:02:02.380
You know, for a minute...

01:02:02.516 --> 01:02:04.416
...I actually thought...
- What?

01:02:04.552 --> 01:02:08.044
That he cared about you? He's an ogre.

01:02:08.189 --> 01:02:10.020
What did you expect?

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.027
You really do have a way
with children, Shrek.

01:02:36.383 --> 01:02:40.183
Leave me out with the waste

01:02:40.321 --> 01:02:43.256
This is not what I do

01:02:43.390 --> 01:02:47.087
It's the wrong time

01:02:47.228 --> 01:02:49.924
She's pulling me through

01:02:50.064 --> 01:02:53.761
It's a small crime

01:02:53.901 --> 01:02:56.529
And I got no excuse

01:02:56.670 --> 01:02:59.070
And is that all right, yeah?

01:03:00.541 --> 01:03:02.566
Is that all right with you?

01:03:03.410 --> 01:03:07.744
Is that all right, yeah?

01:03:08.249 --> 01:03:12.242
If I give my gun away when it's loaded?

01:03:14.421 --> 01:03:19.085
If you don't shoot it
how am I supposed to hold it?

01:03:22.263 --> 01:03:25.130
Is that all right?
Is that all right?

01:03:25.266 --> 01:03:28.702
Is that all right with you?

01:03:28.836 --> 01:03:29.303
No.

01:03:29.303 --> 01:03:29.701
No.

01:03:30.037 --> 01:03:31.868
Had we stayed put like I suggested,

01:03:32.006 --> 01:03:34.804
we'd be sipping tea
out of litle heart-shaped cups.

01:03:34.942 --> 01:03:36.466
Yeah, heart-shaped cups.

01:03:36.610 --> 01:03:39.238
And eating crumpets
smothered with loganberries.

01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:40.972
Yeah, loganberries.

01:03:41.115 --> 01:03:42.980
- Shut up, Oindy.
- Yeah, shut up.

01:03:43.117 --> 01:03:45.984
- No, you shut up.
- Stay out of this.

01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:48.918
Who cares who's "running the kingdom"?

01:03:49.056 --> 01:03:52.287
- I care.
- You should all care.

01:03:56.263 --> 01:03:59.164
I have your badge number, tin can!

01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:01.165
- Donkey?
- Princess!

01:04:01.302 --> 01:04:02.291
Puss?

01:04:02.436 --> 01:04:06.497
I am Puss, stuck here
inside this hideous body.

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:07.664
And I'm me!

01:04:07.808 --> 01:04:08.934
But you're...

01:04:09.076 --> 01:04:11.738
Everything's fruity in the loops,
but what happened is

01:04:11.879 --> 01:04:13.847
we went to high school,
the boat crashed

01:04:13.981 --> 01:04:16.541
and we got bippity-boppity-booped
by the magic man.

01:04:16.684 --> 01:04:18.879
You poor sweet things.

01:04:19.019 --> 01:04:20.418
I don't get it.

01:04:20.554 --> 01:04:24.285
The cat turned into a litle horse
that smells like feet. What's to get?

01:04:24.425 --> 01:04:25.790
Who dat?

01:04:25.926 --> 01:04:26.950
Where's Shrek?

01:04:27.094 --> 01:04:31.087
Oharming has him. He plans to kill Shrek
tonight in front of the whole kingdom!

01:04:32.499 --> 01:04:36.663
All right, everyone.
We need to find a way out now.

01:04:36.804 --> 01:04:40.331
You're right.
Ladies, assume the position!

01:04:45.212 --> 01:04:46.406
What are you doing?

01:04:47.181 --> 01:04:48.546
Waiting to be rescued.

01:04:48.682 --> 01:04:50.650
You've got to be kidding me.

01:04:50.784 --> 01:04:53.548
What else can we do? We're just four...

01:04:53.687 --> 01:04:56.986
...I mean three, super-hot princesses...

01:04:57.124 --> 01:05:01.185
...two circus freaks, a pregnant ogre
and an old lady!

01:05:02.029 --> 01:05:06.363
Excuse me. Old lady coming through.

01:05:14.975 --> 01:05:16.772
Mom!

01:05:16.911 --> 01:05:21.177
You didn't think you got your fighting
skills from your father, did you?

01:05:21.315 --> 01:05:24.045
Excuse me. There's still one more.

01:05:34.228 --> 01:05:36.560
Why don't you just lie down?

01:05:39.233 --> 01:05:42.100
Okay, girls, from here on out...

01:05:42.236 --> 01:05:44.704
...we take care of business ourselves.

01:06:01.755 --> 01:06:06.283
The Far Far Away Theatre at the
Charming Pavilion is proud to present...

01:06:06.427 --> 01:06:08.190
..."It's A Happily Ever After
After AII."

01:06:08.329 --> 01:06:11.628
Enjoy your evening
of theatrical reverie, citizen.

01:06:11.765 --> 01:06:15.098
Oi! No food or beverages in the theater!

01:06:28.949 --> 01:06:30.314
Places, everyone!

01:06:35.456 --> 01:06:36.582
Easy!

01:06:36.724 --> 01:06:40.626
Sorry. I was showing off
for the litle one.

01:06:41.362 --> 01:06:44.957
It's Bring Your Kids to Work Day.
Oome here, beautiful.

01:06:48.135 --> 01:06:51.127
Well, she's got your eye.

01:06:52.373 --> 01:06:57.310
Who would have thought a monster like
me deserved something as special as you?

01:07:38.986 --> 01:07:42.012
Little birdies, take wing

01:07:42.856 --> 01:07:45.484
Flitting down from the trees they appear

01:07:45.626 --> 01:07:48.094
And to chirp in my ear

01:07:49.363 --> 01:07:52.355
All because I sing

01:08:21.995 --> 01:08:23.053
Move it! Go!

01:08:29.670 --> 01:08:31.399
My babies!

01:08:32.406 --> 01:08:33.395
Help!

01:09:18.952 --> 01:09:20.943
Hey, how's it goin'?

01:09:31.631 --> 01:09:33.566
O to the K. The coast is clear.

01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:36.328
Let's do this. Go, Team Dynamite!

01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:40.304
I thought we agreed to use the name
Team Super Oool.

01:09:40.439 --> 01:09:42.670
I recall it was Team Awesome.

01:09:42.809 --> 01:09:44.743
I voted for Team Alpha Wolf Squadron.

01:09:44.877 --> 01:09:46.845
Okay! From henceforth,

01:09:46.979 --> 01:09:51.109
we will be Team Alpha Super Awesome
Oool Dynamite Wolf Squadron.

01:09:51.251 --> 01:09:55.483
Ach de liebe! There is some strange
litle girl over there staring at us!

01:09:56.423 --> 01:09:57.788
Artie!

01:09:57.925 --> 01:09:59.290
Wait, wait!

01:09:59.426 --> 01:10:01.621
Where is the fire, señor?

01:10:01.762 --> 01:10:03.787
Please. Don't act so innocent.

01:10:03.931 --> 01:10:07.697
You both knew what was going on
and kept it to yourselves.

01:10:07.834 --> 01:10:09.426
It's not like it seems.

01:10:09.570 --> 01:10:12.403
It's not? I think it seems prety clear.

01:10:12.539 --> 01:10:15.064
He was using me. That's all.

01:10:15.209 --> 01:10:17.643
Using you? You really don't get it.

01:10:17.778 --> 01:10:20.770
Shrek only said
those things to protect you.

01:10:21.448 --> 01:10:26.112
Oharming was going to kill you, Artie!
Shrek saved your life.

01:10:36.697 --> 01:10:38.289
Oue the spot!

01:10:42.135 --> 01:10:44.660
I wait alone up here

01:10:44.805 --> 01:10:47.501
I'm trapped another day

01:10:47.641 --> 01:10:50.838
Locked up here, please set me free

01:10:50.978 --> 01:10:54.004
My new life I almost see

01:10:54.147 --> 01:10:56.843
A castle, you and me

01:10:56.984 --> 01:11:02.081
Yes, a castle, you and me

01:11:04.157 --> 01:11:05.215
Oherubs!

01:11:09.162 --> 01:11:12.962
Tis I, Tis I
Upon my regal steed

01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:14.727
Princess, my love

01:11:14.868 --> 01:11:17.632
At last you shall be freed
I'm strong

01:11:17.771 --> 01:11:19.739
And brave
And dashing my way there

01:11:20.173 --> 01:11:25.839
With speed! With might!
With soft and bouncy hair!

01:11:26.813 --> 01:11:30.579
- Through the blistering desert
- Hot!

01:11:30.717 --> 01:11:33.743
- Across the stormiest sea
- Wet!

01:11:33.887 --> 01:11:35.878
Facing creatures so vile

01:11:36.023 --> 01:11:37.149
Foul!

01:11:37.291 --> 01:11:41.421
So you can gaze upon me!

01:11:42.729 --> 01:11:45.061
I knew you'd come for me

01:11:45.198 --> 01:11:49.032
And now we finally meet

01:11:49.169 --> 01:11:50.636
I knew you'd wait

01:11:50.771 --> 01:11:55.299
And from my plate of love you'd eat

01:12:15.228 --> 01:12:18.561
Who is this terribly ugly fiend
Who so rudely intervened?

01:12:18.699 --> 01:12:20.530
Will Charming fight or flee?

01:12:20.667 --> 01:12:21.725
Please rescue me!

01:12:21.868 --> 01:12:23.563
From this monstrosity!

01:12:23.704 --> 01:12:28.732
Fear thee not, honey lamb!
I will slice this thing up like a ham!

01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:31.377
Oh, boy.

01:12:31.511 --> 01:12:35.106
You are about to enter a world of pain

01:12:35.248 --> 01:12:39.582
With which you are not familiar!

01:12:43.023 --> 01:12:47.426
It can't be any more painful
than your lousy performance.

01:12:51.098 --> 01:12:53.089
"Prepare, foul beast."

01:12:55.202 --> 01:12:58.467
Prepare, foul beast, your time is done!

01:12:58.605 --> 01:13:01.768
Oould you kill me and then sing?

01:13:03.276 --> 01:13:04.971
Be quiet!

01:13:05.112 --> 01:13:09.242
I'm just having fun with you.
That's actually a very nice leotard.

01:13:09.383 --> 01:13:10.645
Thank you.

01:13:10.784 --> 01:13:12.877
Do they come in men's sizes?

01:13:15.956 --> 01:13:17.685
Now that be funny!

01:13:17.824 --> 01:13:19.792
Enough!

01:13:22.195 --> 01:13:25.995
Now you'll finally
know what it's like...

01:13:26.133 --> 01:13:29.660
...to have everything you worked for...

01:13:29.803 --> 01:13:33.830
...everything that's precious to you,
taken away.

01:13:33.974 --> 01:13:37.307
Now you'll know how I felt.

01:13:44.651 --> 01:13:46.312
Sausage roll!

01:14:03.670 --> 01:14:06.195
Pray for mercy from Puss!

01:14:06.339 --> 01:14:07.829
And Donkey!

01:14:08.041 --> 01:14:09.099
D

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:21.382
Hi, honey.

01:14:21.521 --> 01:14:24.547
Sorry we're late. You okay?

01:14:24.691 --> 01:14:27.023
Much beter, now that you're here.

01:14:29.696 --> 01:14:34.895
So, Oharming, you want to let me out of
these so we can setle this ogre-to-man?

01:14:35.035 --> 01:14:39.369
Ooh, that sounds fun.
But I have a beter idea.

01:14:55.222 --> 01:14:57.622
No! Let go of me!

01:14:57.757 --> 01:15:01.887
You will not ruin things
this time, ogre. Kill it.

01:15:05.732 --> 01:15:07.495
Everybody, stop!

01:15:09.336 --> 01:15:11.429
Oh, what is it now?!

01:15:11.571 --> 01:15:12.833
Artie?

01:15:22.516 --> 01:15:24.984
Who thinks we need
to setle things this way?

01:15:29.256 --> 01:15:32.953
You mean you want to be villains
your whole lives?

01:15:33.093 --> 01:15:36.893
But we are villains!
It's the only thing we know.

01:15:37.030 --> 01:15:39.464
You never wish
you could be something else?

01:15:39.599 --> 01:15:43.057
Easy for you to say. You're not
some evil enchanted tree.

01:15:43.203 --> 01:15:45.967
You morons! Don't listen to him! Atack!

01:15:46.106 --> 01:15:48.904
What Steve means is
it's hard to come by honest work

01:15:49.042 --> 01:15:51.067
when the whole world's against you.

01:15:51.211 --> 01:15:52.940
Right. Thanks, Ed.

01:15:53.079 --> 01:15:57.482
Fair enough. You're right.
I'm not a talking tree.

01:15:57.617 --> 01:15:58.709
But you know...

01:15:58.852 --> 01:16:01.980
...a good friend once told me...

01:16:02.122 --> 01:16:07.150
...just because people treat you
like a villain, or an ogre...

01:16:07.294 --> 01:16:09.285
...orjust some loser...

01:16:10.797 --> 01:16:12.697
...doesn't mean you are one.

01:16:15.569 --> 01:16:19.437
What maters most
is what you think of yourself.

01:16:19.573 --> 01:16:23.873
If there's something you really want,
or someone you want to be...

01:16:24.010 --> 01:16:27.639
...the only person standing
in your way is you.

01:16:28.148 --> 01:16:29.911
- Me?
- Get him!

01:16:30.050 --> 01:16:31.449
No, no, no!

01:16:31.585 --> 01:16:34.520
What I mean is each of you...

01:16:34.654 --> 01:16:36.918
...is standing in your own way.

01:16:40.827 --> 01:16:43.318
I always wanted to play the flute.

01:16:43.463 --> 01:16:47.126
I'd like to open up a spa... in France!

01:16:47.267 --> 01:16:51.829
I grow daffodils. And they're beautiful.

01:17:40.553 --> 01:17:43.716
A new era finally begins!

01:17:45.558 --> 01:17:47.219
Now all of you...

01:17:48.061 --> 01:17:50.461
...bow before your King!

01:17:56.903 --> 01:17:59.235
You need to work on your aim.

01:18:01.574 --> 01:18:04.441
This was supposed to be
my happily ever after!

01:18:04.577 --> 01:18:07.068
Well, you need to keep looking...

01:18:09.082 --> 01:18:11.141
...because I'm not giving up mine.

01:18:16.423 --> 01:18:17.583
Mommy?

01:18:28.935 --> 01:18:31.096
It's yours if you want it.

01:18:31.771 --> 01:18:34.103
But this time it's your choice.

01:18:56.796 --> 01:18:57.820
Author!

01:18:57.964 --> 01:19:01.297
Artie! Artie! Artie! Artie!

01:19:05.638 --> 01:19:08.630
Excuse me. That's my seat.

01:19:09.642 --> 01:19:14.409
Okay, Señor Hocusy-Pocusy, the time
has come to rectify some wrongs!

01:19:14.547 --> 01:19:17.072
Though I have been enjoying
these cat baths.

01:19:17.217 --> 01:19:18.707
Please say you didn't.

01:19:18.852 --> 01:19:20.752
All right! Look.

01:19:20.887 --> 01:19:24.186
You'll feel a pinch and possibly
lower intestinal discomfort...

01:19:24.324 --> 01:19:26.656
...but this should do the trick.

01:19:30.897 --> 01:19:33.365
- Are you?
- I'm me again!

01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:35.764
- And I am not you!
- All right!

01:19:37.337 --> 01:19:38.497
Oops.

01:19:40.507 --> 01:19:41.906
Ah, never mind.

01:19:45.912 --> 01:19:49.973
What did I tell you?
The kid's going to be a great king.

01:19:50.116 --> 01:19:53.677
Well, for what it's worth,
you would have, too.

01:19:55.188 --> 01:19:58.180
I have something
much more important in mind.

01:20:23.716 --> 01:20:24.944
Finally.

01:20:31.724 --> 01:20:33.055
Dada.

01:20:35.161 --> 01:20:39.530
Was I wrong about the world?
It's a beautiful new place

01:20:39.666 --> 01:20:42.157
I smell Shrek Junior!

01:20:42.302 --> 01:20:44.964
Where else could a creep like me

01:20:45.104 --> 01:20:47.834
Meet such a pretty face

01:20:47.974 --> 01:20:51.910
Meeting every day with the rising sun

01:20:54.714 --> 01:20:57.615
Looking up, it's looking like

01:20:57.750 --> 01:21:00.412
My losing streak is done

01:21:01.321 --> 01:21:02.618
Peek-a-boo!

01:21:02.755 --> 01:21:04.086
Peek-a-boo!

01:21:07.293 --> 01:21:09.124
A bouncy, bouncy, boy!

01:21:09.262 --> 01:21:11.958
Used to always feel like

01:21:12.098 --> 01:21:14.760
Wished that I was dressed better

01:21:15.768 --> 01:21:17.429
Where's the baby?

01:21:17.570 --> 01:21:21.939
Never had a lot of luck
Until I finally met her

01:21:31.451 --> 01:21:35.444
Meeting every day with the rising sun

01:21:38.124 --> 01:21:40.285
Looking up, it's looking like

01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:43.793
My losing streak is done

01:21:45.965 --> 01:21:48.297
My losing streak is done

01:21:59.145 --> 01:22:01.807
Well... what shall we do now?

01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:19.491
I got it.

01:22:26.005 --> 01:22:30.374
Puss and Donkey, baby!
Once again, come on!

01:22:30.510 --> 01:22:35.140
I want to thank you for letting me
be myself

01:22:35.281 --> 01:22:36.373
Again!

01:22:36.516 --> 01:22:38.381
Look at my hips!

01:22:38.518 --> 01:22:43.717
I want to thank you for letting me
be myself

01:22:43.856 --> 01:22:45.346
Again!

01:22:50.630 --> 01:22:52.154
- Break it down!
- Let's go!

01:22:52.298 --> 01:22:54.698
Stiff all in the collar

01:22:56.536 --> 01:22:58.697
Fluffy in the face

01:23:00.873 --> 01:23:03.364
Chit chat chatter trying

01:23:04.711 --> 01:23:06.872
Stuffy in the place

01:23:09.048 --> 01:23:11.881
Thank you for the par-tay

01:23:13.052 --> 01:23:14.917
But I could never stay

01:23:15.054 --> 01:23:16.385
I'm sorry.

01:23:17.056 --> 01:23:20.048
I got many things on my mind

01:23:21.394 --> 01:23:23.555
But the word's in the way

01:23:24.564 --> 01:23:29.763
And I want to thank you for letting me
be myself

01:23:29.902 --> 01:23:31.233
Again

01:23:32.238 --> 01:23:34.206
Different strokes for different folks

01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:37.935
Thank you for letting me be myself

01:23:38.077 --> 01:23:39.567
Again

01:23:41.748 --> 01:23:43.238
Break it down!

01:23:44.250 --> 01:23:47.413
Puss and Donkey, baby!
Puss and Donkey, baby!

01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:49.581
Puss and Donkey, baby!

01:23:50.923 --> 01:23:53.084
Dance to the music

01:23:54.927 --> 01:23:57.259
All night long

01:23:59.265 --> 01:24:01.597
Everyday people

01:24:03.269 --> 01:24:05.430
Sing a simple song

01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:09.931
Mama's so happy

01:24:11.778 --> 01:24:13.769
Mama start to cry

01:24:15.948 --> 01:24:18.439
Papa's still singing

01:24:19.619 --> 01:24:23.111
You can make it if you try
So try!

01:24:24.290 --> 01:24:28.158
Thank you for letting me be myself

01:24:28.294 --> 01:24:29.625
Again

01:24:32.632 --> 01:24:36.500
Thank you for letting me be myself

01:24:36.636 --> 01:24:38.331
Again

01:24:38.471 --> 01:24:41.338
Oome on, Donkey. Do something right!

01:24:41.474 --> 01:24:43.874
Put the hoofs together!
Put the hoofs together!

01:24:44.977 --> 01:24:49.175
Stomp your boots, baby! Stomp your
boots, baby! Stomp your boots, baby!

01:24:49.315 --> 01:24:53.183
Thank you for letting me be myself

01:24:53.319 --> 01:24:54.809
Again

01:24:56.989 --> 01:25:01.517
I want to thank you for letting me
be myself

01:25:01.661 --> 01:25:02.753
Again

01:25:02.895 --> 01:25:05.864
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:25:05.998 --> 01:25:09.195
Want to thank you
Just to be my

01:25:09.335 --> 01:25:12.202
Because I just want to be my...
See?

01:25:12.338 --> 01:25:15.034
Can I, can I thank you!
Can I

01:25:15.174 --> 01:25:17.005
Yes! Yes!
