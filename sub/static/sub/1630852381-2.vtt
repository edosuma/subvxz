02:16.302 --> 02:18.972
<i>GOKOK</i>: SOUL

03:13.651 --> 03:14.736
Why did you do it?

03:16.863 --> 03:20.241
Why did you have to kill
my innocent wife and son?

03:20.325 --> 03:22.368
You could have killed only me.

03:23.995 --> 03:25.288
Tell me why.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.833
Tell me why!

03:32.211 --> 03:34.380
<i>This was all your doing.</i>

03:36.299 --> 03:38.384
<i>What have you done?</i>

03:41.346 --> 03:43.598
<i>You have created more bad karma.</i>

03:44.599 --> 03:47.018
<i>And you have brought upon
another retribution.</i>

03:48.811 --> 03:50.104
<i>I despise you.</i>

03:51.731 --> 03:52.815
<i>I truly</i>

03:54.359 --> 03:55.652
<i>despise you.</i>

03:57.153 --> 03:58.655
What do you mean?

04:00.573 --> 04:02.492
<i>I will be born again</i>

04:04.035 --> 04:05.286
<i>with this scar</i>

04:06.829 --> 04:08.498
<i>that you have given me.</i>

04:57.005 --> 04:58.589
Bulgasal is dead.

04:59.590 --> 05:01.926
You killed that which cannot be killed.

05:02.593 --> 05:03.886
But how?

05:07.515 --> 05:09.600
A sword in his body…

05:11.894 --> 05:13.313
Bulgasal…

05:13.396 --> 05:15.023
Has he become a Monster himself?

05:52.518 --> 05:53.770
Commander.

06:10.953 --> 06:12.121
He is a Monster.

06:12.872 --> 06:14.707
He has turned into Bulgasal.

06:15.416 --> 06:17.210
He is Bulgasal.

06:17.293 --> 06:19.337
He will kill us. He will kill us all!

07:10.888 --> 07:13.182
EPISODE 2

07:13.266 --> 07:15.435
He was not a human, my lord.

07:15.518 --> 07:18.521
We should not have trusted someone
who was of ominous birth.

07:18.604 --> 07:21.441
He sacrificed his family
and subordinates to become Bulgasal.

07:23.234 --> 07:26.654
Where are the bodies
of my daughter and grandson?

07:26.737 --> 07:28.489
He must have taken them with him.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.033
He looked like a beast

07:31.951 --> 07:34.036
as he stared at his dead son.

08:11.324 --> 08:14.577
<i>The Royal Court has ordered Hwal,
who has become Bulgasal, to be killed.</i>

08:15.077 --> 08:17.163
<i>If he cannot be killed,</i>

08:17.246 --> 08:19.957
<i>he must be buried alive
and sealed in the ground.</i>

08:20.041 --> 08:22.877
<i>Tell the Royal Court
that I, Dan Geuk, will do it myself.</i>

08:39.519 --> 08:40.853
<i>There are no traces of him.</i>

08:41.437 --> 08:44.440
The sun will set soon,
and Bulgasal will be rampant.

08:45.274 --> 08:46.984
Where is the General?

08:48.277 --> 08:51.531
Due to his arm, he decided to stay
at the foot of the mountain.

09:24.438 --> 09:27.066
I knew you would come
to find me once I was alone.

09:45.334 --> 09:48.004
Is it true that you have become Bulgasal?

09:58.306 --> 09:59.348
Answer me.

10:00.850 --> 10:04.020
Did you sacrifice your men
and become an evil spirit?

10:05.104 --> 10:08.024
Did you really kill Sol
and A-chan with your own hands?

10:16.699 --> 10:17.825
Please kill me.

10:22.246 --> 10:23.205
What?

10:28.836 --> 10:30.296
I cannot die.

10:32.423 --> 10:34.759
I jumped off a cliff

10:36.552 --> 10:38.971
and stabbed myself with a sword,
but I did not die.

10:39.847 --> 10:41.057
I have

10:41.849 --> 10:43.643
truly become…

10:45.519 --> 10:47.271
an immortal Monster.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.733
I have become an evil spirit…

10:53.986 --> 10:55.655
who feeds off human blood.

11:02.453 --> 11:03.579
So it is true.

11:06.082 --> 11:08.668
The Royal Court wants you dead.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.171
If you cannot die,

11:14.090 --> 11:17.551
I will cut you into pieces
and seal you shut at the bottom of a well.

11:28.604 --> 11:30.314
I will ask you one last time.

11:31.607 --> 11:33.359
Did you really kill Sol and A-chan

11:35.027 --> 11:36.946
with your own hands?

11:43.452 --> 11:44.954
I did.

11:47.331 --> 11:48.874
I dragged them into this,

11:49.375 --> 11:51.627
promising that I would break the curse.

11:51.710 --> 11:53.087
So I led them to their deaths.

11:54.922 --> 11:58.008
I was not able to forget how Bulgasal
had saved me when I was little.

12:00.386 --> 12:03.597
So I let it go
and that has led to their deaths.

12:07.726 --> 12:09.228
Their necks were torn.

12:11.689 --> 12:13.899
<i>And as they lay dying
with their eyes still open,</i>

12:15.192 --> 12:17.153
<i>I could not do anything.</i>

12:18.112 --> 12:19.655
So I am the one who killed them.

12:48.851 --> 12:49.852
Go.

12:52.646 --> 12:55.316
Flee from the humans and live in hiding.

12:55.399 --> 12:57.193
Do not harm them.

12:58.652 --> 12:59.987
Why are you doing this?

13:00.905 --> 13:03.240
I am Bulgasal who feeds off their blood.

13:08.204 --> 13:09.705
You are not a Monster.

13:10.831 --> 13:13.667
You were born a human and lived as one.

13:14.251 --> 13:16.545
You have the heart of a human.

13:19.965 --> 13:21.300
So live no matter what.

13:47.785 --> 13:48.953
Kill it!

13:49.537 --> 13:50.746
Behead it!

13:51.789 --> 13:52.915
I saw everything.

13:52.998 --> 13:57.044
That man… No.
That evil spirit wishes to die.

13:57.878 --> 13:59.380
Behead it and put it in the well.

13:59.463 --> 14:01.423
He used to be a human,

14:01.507 --> 14:03.300
so he will not hurt them.

14:03.384 --> 14:05.469
Will you disobey a Royal order?

14:06.428 --> 14:08.097
Monsters must be killed.

14:08.180 --> 14:11.058
He was our comrade
who also sacrificed his life.

14:11.141 --> 14:13.102
He saved our lives many--

14:15.604 --> 14:19.692
I told you not to trust anyone
who was of lowly and ominous birth.

14:19.775 --> 14:23.112
I will tell the Royal Court
that you died while fighting Bulgasal.

14:45.134 --> 14:47.469
Kill it! Kill Bulgasal!

14:49.430 --> 14:50.890
No!

14:54.935 --> 14:56.103
Do you truly wish…

14:58.647 --> 15:00.149
to become a Monster?

15:07.948 --> 15:09.033
Let's go.

15:14.413 --> 15:15.873
Come with me.

15:20.669 --> 15:21.754
Come.

15:54.328 --> 15:56.288
You need to be treated right away.

15:57.206 --> 15:59.083
Let me take you to the village.

15:59.166 --> 16:00.250
It is too late.

16:02.419 --> 16:04.338
Worry about yourself.

16:05.714 --> 16:07.466
Since I have failed,

16:08.509 --> 16:11.929
the Royal Court will send
someone else to do the deed.

16:12.012 --> 16:14.431
It is not too late. Please get up.

16:30.030 --> 16:31.573
Promise me…

16:33.993 --> 16:36.578
that you will never feed off human blood.

16:41.625 --> 16:43.002
Answer me.

16:43.669 --> 16:45.713
Answer me out loud.

16:49.550 --> 16:51.135
Yes, Father.

16:51.218 --> 16:55.139
No matter how many centuries go by,

16:56.098 --> 16:58.058
you must remain a human.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.353
Yes, Father.

17:05.065 --> 17:06.150
Good.

17:11.905 --> 17:13.032
Now…

17:13.657 --> 17:16.285
I would like to rest.

17:20.664 --> 17:23.417
Take me to my daughter.

17:24.293 --> 17:27.671
I must ask her for forgiveness.

17:28.714 --> 17:32.843
All my life,
I have been neglectful of Sol.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.555
I avoided her.

17:38.390 --> 17:41.769
Her abnormal power
of reading people's pasts…

17:44.855 --> 17:47.649
Everyone talked behind her back.

17:49.193 --> 17:52.446
I considered her a strange being myself.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.282
I should have treated her better.

17:56.784 --> 17:59.161
I should have embraced her

18:00.621 --> 18:03.123
<i>when she lost her mother…</i>

18:05.417 --> 18:08.170
<i>and her daughter.</i>

19:01.390 --> 19:02.683
Father…

19:51.356 --> 19:53.025
What you said came true.

19:54.109 --> 19:56.612
Those who were
by my side have all perished

19:56.695 --> 19:58.363
due to Bulgasal's grudge against me.

19:59.990 --> 20:01.825
Is there more to the curse

20:03.452 --> 20:05.662
that you have yet to tell me?

20:11.585 --> 20:16.632
Oh, Bulgasal.
Please let your anger subside.

20:17.507 --> 20:20.761
Please put an end to this cycle of death.

20:21.887 --> 20:24.181
Please put an end

20:24.932 --> 20:27.476
to this bloody carnage.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.605
Why have I become Bulgasal?

20:33.941 --> 20:36.526
Bulgasal is immortal

20:37.486 --> 20:39.947
because it has no soul.

20:41.031 --> 20:45.744
<i>The former Bulgasal took yours.</i>

20:46.370 --> 20:49.039
<i>That is why you have become Bulgasal.</i>

20:50.707 --> 20:53.168
Then what has happened to that woman?

20:53.669 --> 20:56.838
She died as a human.

20:57.464 --> 21:01.677
And she will reincarnate as a human.

21:02.636 --> 21:05.639
She became a human
and will reincarnate as one?

21:08.141 --> 21:10.102
<i>I will be born again</i>

21:10.686 --> 21:13.772
<i>with this scar that you have given me.</i>

21:16.233 --> 21:17.985
<i>You murdered my family</i>

21:18.860 --> 21:21.863
<i>and made me immortal by stealing my soul.</i>

21:23.490 --> 21:26.034
<i>You threw me into this agony.</i>

21:28.787 --> 21:31.373
Then it is my turn to hunt her.

21:32.457 --> 21:34.334
<i>I will let you know</i>

21:34.418 --> 21:36.420
<i>how agonizing it is
to be chased by Bulgasal.</i>

21:39.381 --> 21:41.508
<i>No matter how many times
you are reincarnated,</i>

21:42.676 --> 21:43.885
<i>I will make sure</i>

21:45.220 --> 21:47.764
<i>to find you and get my revenge.</i>

22:03.113 --> 22:08.744
YEAR 1593, JOSEON
JAPANESE INVASION

22:30.682 --> 22:32.017
Let's go!

23:36.456 --> 23:37.749
Stop right there!

23:40.502 --> 23:41.503
Stay still!

23:42.045 --> 23:43.588
Let me go!

23:52.264 --> 23:53.473
Do you want to die?

24:20.292 --> 24:22.335
It is a Monster!

24:23.420 --> 24:24.296
Run!

24:46.443 --> 24:49.196
Promise me that you will never
feed off human blood.

24:51.823 --> 24:53.158
No matter

24:54.075 --> 24:55.827
<i>how many centuries go by,</i>

24:56.411 --> 24:58.246
you must remain a human.

25:26.107 --> 25:31.404
3 YEARS LATER

26:00.767 --> 26:03.061
Have you seen this woman before?

26:04.271 --> 26:05.981
I have seen a drawing

26:07.274 --> 26:08.900
of the same woman.

26:23.832 --> 26:26.751
How did you know about my drawing?

26:36.094 --> 26:39.806
I spotted this woman
passing by the village.

26:40.432 --> 26:45.437
I could not forget
the sight of her so I drew this.

26:49.649 --> 26:51.735
Where did she go?

26:55.613 --> 26:56.906
I killed her.

26:57.407 --> 26:59.367
How long ago was it?

27:03.538 --> 27:05.832
I felt the desire to kill
as soon as I saw her.

27:06.624 --> 27:10.670
It felt like I was born to kill her.

27:16.551 --> 27:19.054
I never felt this way when killing others.

27:22.390 --> 27:26.394
Strangely enough, there was
another man who looked for her.

27:26.478 --> 27:27.771
Who was it?

27:30.732 --> 27:32.734
A young man with a dark emptiness.

27:35.070 --> 27:37.447
He said he was after her soul.

27:41.201 --> 27:43.244
That was when I realized

27:43.328 --> 27:46.539
that I, alongside many others,

27:48.208 --> 27:52.087
was after her soul.

27:56.841 --> 27:58.468
You will pay for this.

27:58.551 --> 28:03.390
I will remember your soul
and I will get my revenge.

28:04.140 --> 28:05.558
I know now.

28:08.144 --> 28:11.481
The soul you are after is actually mine.

28:12.107 --> 28:16.236
You desire to take revenge on me, not her.

28:17.946 --> 28:22.242
You were a Monster
in your previous life and I killed you.

28:22.325 --> 28:24.452
You should not have reincarnated
as a human,

28:24.536 --> 28:26.121
but here you are.

28:29.249 --> 28:31.918
That was also what the man
with the dark emptiness said.

28:32.001 --> 28:34.129
He said I was a murderer

28:34.212 --> 28:36.423
because I was a Monster
in my previous life.

28:41.177 --> 28:43.221
Why was I born like this?

28:44.347 --> 28:47.851
Does this mean I am not human?

28:52.105 --> 28:54.524
Kill me with that sword of yours.

28:56.651 --> 28:58.570
Please…

29:11.875 --> 29:15.128
You are not a human, are you?

29:15.628 --> 29:16.963
I knew it.

29:17.714 --> 29:20.341
Seeing how you do not die,
you must be Bulgasal.

29:22.969 --> 29:25.430
You have no soul so you live forever.

29:25.513 --> 29:27.140
I envy you.

29:27.807 --> 29:30.101
I wonder how that feels.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.146
How does it feel?

29:34.147 --> 29:37.317
I feel endless pain,
so how could you envy me?

29:38.026 --> 29:39.652
This is the underworld.

29:39.736 --> 29:41.488
This is hell!

29:44.157 --> 29:49.329
Take this old man's soul, dear Bulgasal!

29:50.997 --> 29:55.001
Or will I also turn into Bulgasal

29:55.084 --> 29:57.879
if I ate your flesh?

30:35.083 --> 30:37.961
If you go after that woman again

30:38.044 --> 30:40.421
in your next life,

30:41.422 --> 30:42.715
I will…

30:46.845 --> 30:48.179
kill you then as well.

31:18.042 --> 31:19.377
What should I do now?

31:21.296 --> 31:23.381
Things have gotten quite complicated.

31:24.424 --> 31:27.302
You finally became a human
after taking my soul.

31:27.886 --> 31:30.889
But you also took my karma.

31:32.307 --> 31:34.183
Hang in there.

31:36.686 --> 31:39.689
Before a reincarnated Monster gets to you,

31:41.566 --> 31:43.776
I will find you first.

32:43.211 --> 32:49.133
YEAR 2006

32:58.184 --> 32:59.352
You startled me.

33:01.187 --> 33:03.564
My goodness. I thought you were a ghost.

33:03.648 --> 33:04.774
Why are you so startled?

33:04.857 --> 33:07.944
I mean, you suddenly came out of nowhere.

33:09.070 --> 33:10.655
I have a weak heart,

33:10.738 --> 33:12.824
so even the slightest scare
gets it racing.

33:12.907 --> 33:15.410
Maybe I died
after seeing a ghost in my previous life.

33:15.493 --> 33:18.121
That's understandable.
You were at that village after all.

33:18.204 --> 33:19.038
Sorry?

33:25.920 --> 33:27.547
Hey.

33:27.630 --> 33:29.549
Take this and leave.

33:29.632 --> 33:31.551
Stay away from the village for now.

33:31.634 --> 33:33.302
Something terrible has happened!

33:33.386 --> 33:37.223
By the way, you could have come
to the detective agency.

33:37.306 --> 33:39.475
Why do we have
to always meet in spooky places?

33:40.059 --> 33:41.686
It's quiet as a grave.

33:41.769 --> 33:43.396
I don't like meeting people.

33:44.063 --> 33:45.523
I have a social phobia.

33:53.031 --> 33:54.157
You're looking

33:55.033 --> 33:57.243
for a woman and a girl?

33:57.326 --> 33:58.494
These are quite old.

33:58.578 --> 34:01.372
They're the same person.
Please look for her.

34:01.456 --> 34:04.208
What? But these are so old. How--

34:10.757 --> 34:12.258
She probably hasn't changed.

34:23.102 --> 34:25.438
YEAR 2006, SANGYONG CITY

34:44.832 --> 34:47.251
Hey, what's wrong?

34:47.335 --> 34:51.214
That car has been following me
ever since I left school.

34:52.673 --> 34:54.258
No. Don't look.

34:54.842 --> 34:57.345
Why not? Why is it following you?

34:57.428 --> 34:59.013
Beats me.

34:59.639 --> 35:02.058
That car followed me all the way here.

35:02.141 --> 35:04.227
I even memorized the license plate.
It's 3847.

35:05.478 --> 35:07.271
That's so pathetic.

35:07.355 --> 35:10.525
You've been talking nonsense these days.
You remind me of your sister.

35:11.984 --> 35:14.445
Hey, I agree
that Sang-yeon is a bit strange.

35:14.529 --> 35:15.947
But I'm not like her.

35:16.030 --> 35:18.366
We're totally different.

35:18.449 --> 35:21.327
That's true. She was a top student.

35:21.410 --> 35:22.578
Unlike you.

35:23.162 --> 35:25.915
Are you kidding me?
I can do well if I want to.

35:25.998 --> 35:27.333
I just don't.

35:28.167 --> 35:30.711
But is she really
not coming back to school?

35:31.379 --> 35:32.797
What does she do at home?

35:49.355 --> 35:52.108
I don't know.
She stays in her room all day long.

35:52.191 --> 35:54.277
She doesn't even clean or do the laundry.

35:54.360 --> 35:57.071
When our mom's off to work,
I have to do everything at home.

35:57.864 --> 35:59.574
She's so annoying.

36:04.495 --> 36:09.208
But there's one thing she always tells me.

36:10.710 --> 36:13.921
"If a stranger follows you,
run away as fast as you can."

36:22.388 --> 36:24.682
What? He just left.

36:25.933 --> 36:28.144
Seriously, that's so pathetic.

36:29.145 --> 36:31.772
JEON BOUTIQUE

36:42.950 --> 36:44.952
33G 3847

37:27.536 --> 37:30.831
<i>Dad, Grandma bought me these socks.</i>

37:36.462 --> 37:38.923
Sang-un, what's wrong?

37:40.466 --> 37:44.637
A strange man was following me.

37:55.398 --> 37:56.482
A strange man?

37:58.484 --> 38:02.697
He was tailing me with his car,
so I ran away.

38:03.489 --> 38:06.075
Did you see his face?
What did he look like?

38:07.159 --> 38:08.327
I don't know.

38:09.203 --> 38:12.581
He was wearing a hoodie. It was dark too.

38:13.332 --> 38:15.876
I told you to always wear a mask outside.

38:15.960 --> 38:17.795
It's suffocating.

38:18.546 --> 38:21.465
Did he see your face?

38:24.969 --> 38:26.178
Yes.

38:26.262 --> 38:30.057
He got out of the car
and asked to see my shoulder.

38:30.141 --> 38:32.643
He must have been some pervert.

38:36.314 --> 38:39.984
Sang-yeon, what's wrong?

38:40.693 --> 38:41.819
He…

38:42.987 --> 38:44.488
BULGASAL

38:45.114 --> 38:46.282
He's here.

39:14.018 --> 39:15.478
I'm home.

39:17.521 --> 39:18.981
Sorry for being late.

39:19.065 --> 39:21.317
Work ended late.

39:23.402 --> 39:25.363
Did you have cup noodles for dinner again?

39:27.156 --> 39:28.449
Where are your sisters?

39:29.158 --> 39:31.118
They left me here…

39:33.245 --> 39:34.455
and went somewhere.

39:34.538 --> 39:35.956
Where did they go?

40:16.372 --> 40:17.832
Where are we going?

40:18.624 --> 40:20.543
Bulgasal knows where we live.

40:21.460 --> 40:23.170
We need to go where he can't find us.

40:23.254 --> 40:24.463
Where is that?

40:25.256 --> 40:27.883
And shouldn't we at least tell Mom?

40:27.967 --> 40:29.385
She'd be worried.

40:38.727 --> 40:39.812
Sang-yeon.

40:41.188 --> 40:42.273
Sang-yeon.

40:42.815 --> 40:44.900
-What is it?
-It feels like

40:44.984 --> 40:48.904
a cockroach is crawling all over my body.

40:48.988 --> 40:51.365
I'm getting goosebumps,
and my hands are trembling.

40:51.449 --> 40:52.658
Look.

41:43.375 --> 41:47.254
Sang-yeon, that bus driver
keeps following us.

41:47.338 --> 41:48.214
Don't look at him.

41:49.173 --> 41:50.090
Keep walking.

41:59.225 --> 42:00.100
Don't follow us.

42:00.684 --> 42:02.144
Sang-yeon.

42:02.228 --> 42:03.437
I think I know you.

42:04.355 --> 42:08.234
-I think I do.
-Keep following, and I'll kill you.

42:20.955 --> 42:22.206
The smell of your soul.

42:23.749 --> 42:25.751
The smell of your soul.

42:26.710 --> 42:28.379
-Who are you?
-Sir.

42:28.462 --> 42:31.423
-Why are you doing this? Go away!
-Who are you?

42:38.973 --> 42:40.266
Hey, Han-su!

42:41.559 --> 42:42.726
What's going on?

42:43.394 --> 42:44.395
Hey.

42:45.521 --> 42:47.439
-What are you doing?
-Stop it.

42:47.523 --> 42:49.942
-Hey!
-Let me go!

42:50.025 --> 42:52.695
-Get a grip!
-Get a hold of yourself!

42:55.406 --> 42:56.699
<i>Who was that man?</i>

42:58.200 --> 43:00.911
-Do you guys know each other?
-He wasn't human.

43:08.836 --> 43:10.963
He may have reincarnated as a human,

43:12.047 --> 43:13.757
but he used to be a Monster.

43:13.841 --> 43:15.134
A Monster?

43:15.217 --> 43:16.510
He's after my soul.

43:16.594 --> 43:20.055
Your hands trembled
and you got goosebumps in the bus, right?

43:20.764 --> 43:23.100
Yes. What was that about?

43:24.351 --> 43:26.270
It means you recognize them as well.

43:26.854 --> 43:29.106
You recognize those Monsters
from the past.

43:29.189 --> 43:31.233
This won't be the last time you meet one.

43:31.317 --> 43:33.068
-Next time--
-Have you always had

43:33.152 --> 43:34.653
that knife with you?

43:35.779 --> 43:38.240
Can't we report whatever it is

43:38.324 --> 43:40.242
that's looking for you to the police?

43:40.743 --> 43:42.036
The police are useless.

43:42.620 --> 43:44.163
We can't trust them either.

43:45.581 --> 43:47.499
Why is it looking for you?

43:50.628 --> 43:52.046
It holds a grudge

43:52.129 --> 43:54.965
from the past.
Specifically, from its previous life.

43:55.049 --> 43:57.009
Previous life?
Are you still on about that?

43:57.593 --> 43:59.053
I told you I remember.

43:59.970 --> 44:01.347
But you don't believe me.

44:03.349 --> 44:04.308
You know what?

44:05.768 --> 44:07.394
Let's just go home.

44:07.478 --> 44:09.688
We can't. It'll hunt us down.

44:09.772 --> 44:12.024
That man you just saw
is nothing compared to it.

44:12.107 --> 44:13.359
The most frightening thing

44:14.360 --> 44:15.653
is Bulgasal.

44:15.736 --> 44:17.363
Bulgasal? I don't care.

44:17.446 --> 44:19.615
I'm going to call Mom
and ask her to pick us up!

44:21.325 --> 44:23.535
That's why I told you not to go outside.

44:23.619 --> 44:24.995
I told you to wear a mask.

44:25.496 --> 44:27.831
Since we look the same,
you'd grab their attention.

44:27.915 --> 44:30.709
If Bulgasal spots you, we'll both be dead!

44:34.046 --> 44:36.674
Do you think I wanted to be your twin?

44:36.757 --> 44:37.925
I never asked for this!

44:38.509 --> 44:41.220
I didn't do anything,
so why should I run away as well?

44:41.804 --> 44:44.807
I agree with my friends.
You're so strange.

44:44.890 --> 44:46.141
I think you're insane!

44:46.725 --> 44:48.852
Everything including Bulgasal is made up!

45:40.320 --> 45:42.030
How much longer do we need to walk?

45:42.614 --> 45:43.699
I'm hungry.

45:44.366 --> 45:46.452
We're almost there. It's that house.

45:58.297 --> 45:59.965
Whose house is this?

46:02.092 --> 46:03.469
A longtime friend's.

46:04.261 --> 46:05.721
She'll help us.

46:19.026 --> 46:21.069
I told you I'd be back.

46:22.404 --> 46:23.530
Is it you, sister?

46:26.283 --> 46:27.159
Is it you?

46:28.327 --> 46:29.745
It's…

46:29.828 --> 46:32.164
It's you!

46:42.090 --> 46:43.258
Sister?

47:55.497 --> 47:59.167
Hey, are you done talking?
Can we leave now?

47:59.793 --> 48:02.921
Stay here for the time being.
I have somewhere to go.

48:03.005 --> 48:06.049
Are you telling me
to stay here without you?

48:08.969 --> 48:10.262
Why?

48:10.762 --> 48:12.639
Can't I just tag along?

48:13.348 --> 48:15.309
That'll only put both of us in danger.

48:16.518 --> 48:18.812
So listen carefully
to what I'm about to say.

48:18.895 --> 48:21.648
I don't want to hear it.
I'm going with you. Where's my bag?

48:21.732 --> 48:25.152
Listen to me. Don't call our house.

48:25.235 --> 48:27.029
You can never go back there.

48:27.112 --> 48:31.241
If you don't listen to me,
your family will die because of you.

48:31.325 --> 48:34.411
They're all going to die?

48:34.494 --> 48:36.288
What do you mean by "your family"?

48:36.371 --> 48:38.999
They're your family too.

48:39.082 --> 48:40.626
Promise me you'll do as I say.

48:42.961 --> 48:46.214
Promise me you won't go back there.
Answer me!

48:48.467 --> 48:51.678
Fine. I promise.

48:54.014 --> 48:55.515
It won't take long, right?

48:56.892 --> 48:58.352
Be a good girl.

48:58.435 --> 49:00.187
Where are you going?

49:05.192 --> 49:07.569
I need to go back
and put an end to this karma.

49:08.695 --> 49:10.322
This is my final chance.

49:11.531 --> 49:14.326
I need to find the sword
that can kill Bulgasal.

49:14.409 --> 49:15.619
The same sword…

49:17.704 --> 49:19.081
that killed me 600 years ago.

49:30.801 --> 49:33.845
She shouldn't have reincarnated like this.

50:28.316 --> 50:30.402
Sang-un, where are you?

50:30.485 --> 50:31.737
<i>Are you okay?</i>

50:34.364 --> 50:37.075
Yes. I'm okay.

50:37.159 --> 50:38.702
<i>Is Sang-yeon with you?</i>

50:40.662 --> 50:41.747
No.

50:44.082 --> 50:45.625
Not anymore.

50:46.376 --> 50:47.669
<i>She's not with me.</i>

50:50.338 --> 50:54.217
She said I shouldn't go back home.

50:56.428 --> 50:58.597
She said our entire family would die

50:59.723 --> 51:00.849
if I did.

51:02.976 --> 51:05.479
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

51:06.354 --> 51:07.898
I'm scared.

51:07.981 --> 51:11.151
<i>Where are you?
I'll come pick you up, okay?</i>

51:12.611 --> 51:13.737
Where are you?

51:34.174 --> 51:36.051
You can't go! Come back here.

51:37.177 --> 51:39.763
Hurry up. Good grief. Come, now.

51:41.139 --> 51:45.352
She told you not to go back home.

51:46.102 --> 51:48.271
She said you'd die if you did.

51:52.442 --> 51:53.443
You…

52:05.872 --> 52:08.166
HAYONG BUS TERMINAL

53:00.468 --> 53:01.511
33G 3847

53:25.201 --> 53:27.287
Gosh, they're under construction again.

53:28.413 --> 53:29.456
Let's go.

53:29.539 --> 53:30.999
Where's Si-ho?

53:31.082 --> 53:32.667
She's at her friend's.

53:33.251 --> 53:34.669
You look after her tomorrow.

53:34.753 --> 53:37.172
I'll look for Sang-yeon
first thing in the morning.

53:37.255 --> 53:38.381
Okay.

53:44.262 --> 53:48.308
APARTMENT STAIRS UNDER CONSTRUCTION

54:17.587 --> 54:18.880
-Sang-yeon!
-Sang-yeon!

54:18.964 --> 54:20.548
I told you not to come here.

54:21.967 --> 54:23.718
Sang-yeon, look--

54:23.802 --> 54:25.929
We have no time. Go somewhere else.

54:26.012 --> 54:27.514
What's going on?

54:27.597 --> 54:29.432
Tell me. I'll--

54:29.516 --> 54:30.600
Stop it!

54:32.268 --> 54:33.687
I'm not your daughter.

54:34.270 --> 54:37.857
-Sang-yeon.
-Get out of here if you want to live.

54:48.660 --> 54:49.661
Mom.

54:59.963 --> 55:03.341
What is that sound?

55:05.051 --> 55:06.261
Run.

55:09.514 --> 55:10.598
Go.

55:17.647 --> 55:19.566
Hello? There's…

55:19.649 --> 55:22.068
There's something strange
in our apartment.

55:26.239 --> 55:28.950
Well, I don't think it's a person.

55:30.577 --> 55:33.705
If it comes in here,
go next door through this.

55:35.248 --> 55:37.083
-Sang-yeon.
-What is it?

55:39.627 --> 55:41.046
I have something to say.

55:42.922 --> 55:45.550
I…

55:46.176 --> 55:47.510
Well…

56:16.956 --> 56:18.374
Who are you?

56:23.338 --> 56:25.882
It's trying to get inside my apartment.
Please hurry!

56:32.138 --> 56:34.599
Is it a dead end? What should we do?

56:36.059 --> 56:37.977
Stop that!

56:40.355 --> 56:43.191
Listen. I'll grab onto it
and buy you some time.

56:43.274 --> 56:45.235
-Run away with your mom.
-What about you?

56:46.736 --> 56:49.823
I'm done for. This was my final chance.

56:49.906 --> 56:51.407
Final chance for what?

56:53.451 --> 56:55.286
I won't reincarnate anymore.

56:56.329 --> 56:59.040
Stop that! The police are coming!

57:00.166 --> 57:03.253
Go hide in that room
while I buy you some time.

57:03.336 --> 57:06.381
No. I'll protect you two.

57:06.464 --> 57:07.549
I will.

57:07.632 --> 57:10.135
So go hide in your room.

57:16.349 --> 57:18.017
Hide in here. Hurry.

57:18.101 --> 57:19.018
No.

57:19.644 --> 57:20.687
We have no time.

57:24.107 --> 57:25.817
Don't come out of there.

57:25.900 --> 57:28.069
I don't want to be alone.

57:33.199 --> 57:35.618
Listen carefully. You have to live.

57:35.702 --> 57:38.329
Live in hiding, and don't trust anyone.

57:38.413 --> 57:39.247
And…

57:41.249 --> 57:43.001
look for a way to kill Bulgasal.

57:43.084 --> 57:46.087
How? How do I look for it?

57:47.088 --> 57:48.465
You'll recognize it.

57:50.175 --> 57:51.759
It's…

57:57.474 --> 57:59.225
Get out of my house!

58:00.059 --> 58:01.144
Get out!

58:05.815 --> 58:07.108
Sang-yeon!

58:07.901 --> 58:10.320
Sang-yeon!

59:10.588 --> 59:11.881
Run.

59:46.833 --> 59:48.543
How could something like this happen?

59:48.626 --> 59:50.670
-The police are here.
-It happened up there?

1:00:20.074 --> 1:00:21.326
She's alive.

1:00:22.493 --> 1:00:23.911
One of them is alive!

1:00:45.141 --> 1:00:47.226
Where is your younger sister?

1:00:51.439 --> 1:00:53.733
Can you tell me

1:00:54.692 --> 1:00:56.027
what happened?

1:01:07.413 --> 1:01:08.414
Excuse me.

1:01:09.707 --> 1:01:10.917
Min Sang-un.

1:01:12.752 --> 1:01:16.381
Do you remember the culprit's face?

1:01:45.702 --> 1:01:46.911
Mom.

1:01:49.330 --> 1:01:50.748
Sang-yeon.

1:02:00.007 --> 1:02:01.718
Listen carefully. You have to live.

1:02:02.301 --> 1:02:04.262
Live in hiding, and don't trust anyone.

1:02:05.012 --> 1:02:08.349
And look for a way to kill Bulgasal.

1:02:44.260 --> 1:02:46.262
PATIENT NAME: MIN SANG-UN

1:03:15.708 --> 1:03:16.834
Please…

1:03:17.627 --> 1:03:20.421
let us live here.

1:03:34.852 --> 1:03:40.316
15 YEARS LATER, PRESENT DAY

1:04:17.436 --> 1:04:18.688
Who are you?

1:04:22.275 --> 1:04:25.695
Oh, I'm looking for someone.

1:04:29.156 --> 1:04:31.951
Didn't two sisters live here?

1:04:32.034 --> 1:04:35.746
-The older sister's name is Min Sang-un.
-Min Sang-un?

1:04:36.956 --> 1:04:38.624
I don't recognize that name.

1:04:39.542 --> 1:04:42.545
But two sisters did live here
with their grandma.

1:04:43.254 --> 1:04:44.589
Where are they now?

1:04:44.672 --> 1:04:47.133
All three of them vanished into thin air.

1:04:47.216 --> 1:04:50.595
They ran away in the middle of the night
as if loan sharks were after them.

1:04:52.096 --> 1:04:54.932
By the way, who are you?

1:04:55.641 --> 1:04:56.809
Why are you--

1:04:56.893 --> 1:04:59.103
Sang-un is someone I know very well.

1:04:59.186 --> 1:05:00.688
I've known her for a long time.

1:05:02.565 --> 1:05:04.317
How was she?

1:05:06.193 --> 1:05:07.361
She was…

1:05:53.074 --> 1:05:54.116
Hyeon-ju.

1:05:55.076 --> 1:05:56.452
That's your name, right?

1:05:56.535 --> 1:05:58.454
You should take a breather.

1:05:59.163 --> 1:06:00.790
I'm all done.

1:06:00.873 --> 1:06:04.043
I heard you're a laundry plant rookie.
Isn't it tough?

1:06:04.126 --> 1:06:06.837
Geez. This is a cakewalk.

1:06:06.921 --> 1:06:09.298
I've worked all sorts of jobs,
and this is nothing.

1:06:09.382 --> 1:06:10.508
Goodness.

1:06:10.591 --> 1:06:12.009
She's incredible.

1:06:13.427 --> 1:06:14.637
Come join us.

1:06:14.720 --> 1:06:15.721
Coming.

1:06:17.890 --> 1:06:19.183
Gosh, it's hot.

1:06:20.393 --> 1:06:22.228
Do you live in Sangyong City?

1:06:22.812 --> 1:06:24.855
I do. I recently moved here.

1:06:25.439 --> 1:06:28.442
I must have itchy feet.
I move around a lot.

1:06:28.526 --> 1:06:29.735
Are you married?

1:06:29.819 --> 1:06:33.197
Goodness. Of course. I must look young.

1:06:33.280 --> 1:06:36.283
Then what does your husband do?
Why are you here?

1:06:36.367 --> 1:06:39.161
All husbands are the same.
He's jobless and at home.

1:06:39.245 --> 1:06:40.454
Is he?

1:06:40.538 --> 1:06:44.250
I guess all husbands, no matter their age,
are a pain in the neck.

1:06:44.333 --> 1:06:47.420
I agree. He may look like a grown-up,
but he's still a kid.

1:06:47.503 --> 1:06:48.796
Who eats a lot.

1:06:48.879 --> 1:06:50.840
And likes to spend money.

1:06:54.885 --> 1:06:58.222
Oh, right. I'd like to take
today's night shift off.

1:06:58.723 --> 1:06:59.682
Would that be okay?

1:06:59.765 --> 1:07:03.144
What's gotten into you?
You always worked day in, day out.

1:07:04.562 --> 1:07:06.772
I need to head home early today.

1:07:06.856 --> 1:07:07.773
What for?

1:07:08.357 --> 1:07:09.984
Is it your wedding anniversary?

1:07:10.067 --> 1:07:12.111
I guess they're still newlyweds.

1:07:12.194 --> 1:07:13.029
Right!

1:07:13.779 --> 1:07:15.656
Not really.

1:07:15.740 --> 1:07:18.451
Today's just a special day.

1:07:18.534 --> 1:07:21.370
What kind of a special day?
She's piqued my curiosity.

1:07:21.454 --> 1:07:24.457
Gosh, you're always curious
about things. I just don't get it.

1:07:25.041 --> 1:07:26.792
I just want to know what today is.

1:07:42.016 --> 1:07:46.312
WE DEMAND A CLEAR RELOCATION PLAN
FROM THE CONSTRUCTOR!

1:07:51.067 --> 1:07:57.239
EUNBAEK APARTMENT IS OFF LIMITS
DUE TO DEMOLITION WORK

1:08:26.894 --> 1:08:28.729
Hide in here. Hurry.

1:08:28.813 --> 1:08:29.772
<i>No.</i>

1:08:30.272 --> 1:08:31.690
<i>We have no time.</i>

1:08:33.234 --> 1:08:35.653
<i>No. I'll protect you two.</i>

1:08:36.320 --> 1:08:37.279
<i>I will.</i>

1:08:37.947 --> 1:08:40.825
<i>Stop that! The police are coming!</i>

1:08:46.038 --> 1:08:48.666
<i>Sang-un, don't forget what I told you.</i>

1:08:48.749 --> 1:08:50.334
<i>Sang-yeon!</i>

1:08:50.417 --> 1:08:52.795
<i>Sang-yeon!</i>

1:09:48.017 --> 1:09:49.643
- <i>-Sang-yeon.
- What is it?</i>

1:09:53.022 --> 1:09:54.565
I have something to say.

1:09:55.482 --> 1:09:57.234
I couldn't tell you…

1:10:04.867 --> 1:10:06.327
that I was sorry…

1:10:07.995 --> 1:10:09.580
for not believing you.

1:10:10.164 --> 1:10:13.584
You're so strange. I think you're insane!

1:10:15.002 --> 1:10:17.087
I'm sorry for calling you insane.

1:10:25.888 --> 1:10:27.848
I wanted to come one last time

1:10:29.516 --> 1:10:31.143
before they demolished this place.

1:10:33.687 --> 1:10:37.233
Today's the day you and Mom died.

1:10:41.737 --> 1:10:42.988
I'm sorry, Sang-yeon.

1:10:46.659 --> 1:10:47.993
It took me…

1:10:50.079 --> 1:10:52.081
fifteen years to come back here.

1:10:56.252 --> 1:10:57.419
I'm sorry.

1:11:00.839 --> 1:11:04.260
I've been doing as you told me to.

1:11:08.264 --> 1:11:10.683
Listen carefully. You have to live.

1:11:10.766 --> 1:11:12.101
Live in hiding.

1:11:14.103 --> 1:11:15.437
I survived.

1:11:17.356 --> 1:11:19.275
And I'm still living in hiding.

1:11:19.358 --> 1:11:20.859
<i>And don't trust anyone.</i>

1:11:23.279 --> 1:11:26.323
I don't trust anyone.

1:11:27.408 --> 1:11:29.410
<i>And look for a way to kill Bulgasal.</i>

1:11:32.121 --> 1:11:33.372
But Sang-yeon…

1:11:33.914 --> 1:11:36.375
<i>You'll recognize it. It's…</i>

1:11:36.458 --> 1:11:38.711
I don't remember what you said after that.

1:11:40.879 --> 1:11:42.631
It must have been important.

1:11:48.679 --> 1:11:49.888
<i>But I can't remember.</i>

1:11:55.060 --> 1:11:56.603
I'm sorry.

1:14:03.188 --> 1:14:05.732
What in the world is Bulgasal?

1:14:05.816 --> 1:14:09.194
<i>Why have you been searching
for Min Sang-un for the past 15 years?</i>

1:14:10.070 --> 1:14:13.490
<i>Why are you Monsters
trying so hard to kill me?</i>

1:14:13.574 --> 1:14:15.033
It was you, wasn't it?

1:14:19.455 --> 1:14:20.831
Stay away, you murderer!

1:14:21.457 --> 1:14:22.666
Where are you going?

1:14:24.793 --> 1:14:26.170
<i>I finally found you.</i>

1:14:27.880 --> 1:14:32.551
