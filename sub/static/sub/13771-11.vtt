It's your fault
for inviting Stevie over.

01:05.413 --> 01:07.458
He can't do anything,
so we can't do anything,

01:07.545 --> 01:08.938
and it's always boring and lame.

01:09.025 --> 01:11.506
Reese, he's not deaf.

01:11.593 --> 01:13.116
I have...

01:14.596 --> 01:16.902
my fun.

01:16.989 --> 01:19.253
This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

01:19.340 --> 01:21.037
This would be fun
if I were looking at it.

01:21.124 --> 01:23.735
When you read it,
it's not fun. It's sad.

01:23.822 --> 01:25.824
Now I'm bored and sad.
Thanks a lot, Stevie!

01:25.911 --> 01:27.870
-Reese!
-No. It's horrible.

01:27.957 --> 01:29.872
I think it sucks
that he always gets his face

01:29.959 --> 01:33.093
rubbed in the fact that he will
never get to enjoy anything.

01:33.180 --> 01:37.358
Maybe you'd be happier
if they stuck you
in some kind of special tank.

01:37.445 --> 01:38.576
-Whoa. Check this out!
-What?

01:38.663 --> 01:39.577
Street-lugeing!

01:39.664 --> 01:41.623
Look at those pictures!

01:41.710 --> 01:43.103
"Police call it
the most reckless,

01:43.190 --> 01:44.408
dangerous teen craze
in years."

01:44.495 --> 01:46.149
It says they look
back with fondness

01:46.236 --> 01:47.542
on the crack epidemic.

01:47.629 --> 01:50.414
We can totally build
a board like that!

01:51.198 --> 01:52.895
Except we wouldn't.

01:52.982 --> 01:55.637
Because our parents
wouldn't allow it.

01:55.724 --> 01:56.899
So, since we're not doing it,

01:56.986 --> 01:58.118
no one has to say anything.

01:58.205 --> 02:00.163
Yes, this sport seems immature.

02:00.250 --> 02:02.905
And frankly,
I just think it's uncool.

02:02.992 --> 02:05.125
Hey, Stevie, look. Pentominos.
Why were we bored?

02:07.301 --> 02:10.955
So, you just bought
a new bed just like that?

02:11.043 --> 02:14.177
Hal, we had that smelly,
saggy old one for 20 years.

02:14.264 --> 02:15.352
It's time for a new one.

02:15.439 --> 02:17.398
This one
is certainly bigger.

02:17.485 --> 02:19.356
Yeah. It's king-sized.
They're a little bigger.

02:19.443 --> 02:21.010
So you'll be further away.

02:21.097 --> 02:22.838
I guess.
Maybe a couple inches.

02:22.925 --> 02:24.970
So, is that the reason?

02:25.057 --> 02:27.059
You want there
to be more distance between us?

02:27.147 --> 02:28.974
Hal, I didn't really think
about the size.

02:29.061 --> 02:30.628
It was on sale at Mattress King.

02:30.715 --> 02:32.761
I guess you couldn't pass up
a deal like that, huh?

02:32.848 --> 02:35.372
It's just interesting
to learn how it starts.

02:35.459 --> 02:36.808
How what starts?

02:36.895 --> 02:38.549
Well, first you buy
the king-size bed--

02:38.636 --> 02:39.855
the largest bed made.

02:39.942 --> 02:41.422
But then, of course,
at some point,

02:41.509 --> 02:42.684
even the giant bed
doesn't put enough distance

02:42.771 --> 02:45.121
between you
and the hideous monster,

02:45.208 --> 02:47.428
so you start sleeping
in another room.

02:47.515 --> 02:49.952
Then, soon, we're barely
exchanging pleasantries.

02:50.039 --> 02:51.519
And then, one day, you say,

02:51.606 --> 02:53.869
"Hal, let's just say
what we're both thinking,"

02:53.956 --> 02:55.784
and then I end up eating alone
on a Formica table

02:55.871 --> 02:58.090
under a swinging light bulb

02:58.178 --> 02:59.788
while you're on a beach in Ibiza

02:59.875 --> 03:02.443
being rubbed with cocoa butter
by your new lover

03:02.530 --> 03:04.923
who you can never get
too close to!

03:05.010 --> 03:06.577
Hal, it's a bed!

03:06.664 --> 03:09.363
The old one was horrible.
This one is nice.

03:10.929 --> 03:14.019
Look, I know this
is a big change for you.

03:14.106 --> 03:17.022
So I'm just going to have
to think of some way

03:17.109 --> 03:20.635
to make you very,
very happy in this bed.

03:20.722 --> 03:21.897
Good luck!

03:28.904 --> 03:30.166
I'm here to snitch.

03:30.253 --> 03:32.168
Reese and Malcolm are
in the garage.

03:32.255 --> 03:34.039
They won't let me in,
but they're building something.

03:34.126 --> 03:36.520
If you want help in the
penalty phase, let me know.

03:36.607 --> 03:39.219
Dewey, I am not going to go
in there and have a big fight
with the boys

03:39.306 --> 03:40.959
because you've got
nothing to do.

03:41.046 --> 03:42.526
We have a rule in this family

03:42.613 --> 03:45.442
about what we do
when we're bored.

04:29.356 --> 04:31.488
We're not putting
a "No Fat Chicks" sticker on it.

04:31.575 --> 04:33.098
All right, but it's
still our policy.

04:33.185 --> 04:35.536
What are you crying about?

04:35.623 --> 04:37.146
I was just sitting there

04:37.233 --> 04:38.887
and this... this opera came on.

04:38.974 --> 04:41.324
People screaming and hating.

04:41.411 --> 04:44.153
It was our family,
but with music!

04:44.240 --> 04:46.982
And they all mixed together
in a counterpoint

04:47.069 --> 04:49.854
that underscored the futility
of their lives!

04:49.941 --> 04:53.902
And the stretto showed
the minor key had been hiding

04:53.989 --> 04:58.602

"Hit me, Reese.

05:01.213 --> 05:03.477

stop hitting me."

you gave us,

05:22.365 --> 05:24.062

to show our work?

hand in some tinfoil?

05:31.809 --> 05:34.246

I want to write an opera.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.770
I know I can do it.

05:35.857 --> 05:37.467
I have all the music.

05:37.554 --> 05:39.991
I can hear it
in my head.

05:40.078 --> 05:42.254
I just don't have a story
to hang it on.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.952
It has to be something
so dramatic

05:44.039 --> 05:45.475
it's like a knife in the heart.

05:45.562 --> 05:47.608

05:52.134 --> 05:54.484

05:54.571 --> 05:58.140
The sounds produced by said
animals are, respectively:

05:58.227 --> 06:01.491
moo, neigh, oink,

06:01.578 --> 06:05.930
cluck, gobble, silent.

I don't see anyone.

06:10.935 --> 06:12.502
Are you sure this
is the right place?

06:12.589 --> 06:13.982
I don't know.

not gonna happen.

from the asphalt.

I can do this.

or brain-damaged.

I think I'm gonna turn out
to be a really good luger.

07:20.701 --> 07:23.399
The whole "unpopular" thing
will be just a funny story

07:23.486 --> 07:24.792
about my days pre-luge.

07:24.879 --> 07:26.750
I bet I'll get my own line
of clothing.

07:26.837 --> 07:27.795
Maybe a girlfriend.

07:27.882 --> 07:29.492
Maybe two.

07:29.579 --> 07:32.582
They'd fight over me,
but I'd make them work it out.

07:39.894 --> 07:42.984
Someone owes me
an extreme apology!

07:43.071 --> 07:44.594
Hey!

07:44.681 --> 07:46.161
Hey, you! Jerk!

07:46.248 --> 07:48.206
You totally
made me crash!

07:48.293 --> 07:50.557
Just because you can blow
a lot of money

07:50.644 --> 07:52.297
on some high-end luge
doesn't mean you're not a jerk!

07:52.384 --> 07:54.082
You're just a rich jerk.

07:54.169 --> 07:55.431

-Aha!
-Hal!

08:30.292 --> 08:32.599
Oh, what a blind fool
I've been!

08:32.686 --> 08:34.426
To think, when you said
you didn't buy this bed

08:34.514 --> 08:36.298
to get away from me,
I believed you!

08:36.385 --> 08:38.299
Oh, Hal, calm down!

08:38.386 --> 08:40.780
It's just that, when you sleep,
you're so hot you radiate heat.

08:40.868 --> 08:42.609
You're like a giant radiator!

08:42.696 --> 08:44.828
And, when I sleep,
I need to flop my arms around,

08:44.915 --> 08:46.874
and I can't do that
if you're on top of me!

08:46.961 --> 08:49.441
How long have you found
me hideous?

08:49.529 --> 08:50.878
For God's sakes, this is why

08:50.965 --> 08:52.488
I have to lie to you
all the time!

08:52.575 --> 08:53.881
Did you ever love me?

08:53.968 --> 08:55.709
Who are you?
[baby crying]

08:55.796 --> 08:57.406
Fair warning, Hal.

he is yours for the night!

08:59.277 --> 09:01.541

09:01.628 --> 09:03.804
Oh, you must have laughed at me
for swallowing that one!

09:03.891 --> 09:05.936
They don't know the meaning
of the word "sale" over there.

09:06.023 --> 09:08.286
Their everyday prices
are guaranteed rock-bottom!

to get your own way.
