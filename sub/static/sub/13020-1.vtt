02:40.994 --> 02:42.871
That's your Uncle Ethan!

02:56.176 --> 02:58.053
Welcome home, Ethan.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.656
You ain't much bigger
than when I last saw you!

03:17.739 --> 03:18.991
I'm Deborah.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.993
There's Lucy over there.

03:24.955 --> 03:26.415
And you're Lucy?

03:26.450 --> 03:29.960
Yeah, I'm Lucy. I'm mighty glad
to see you, Uncle Ethan.

03:30.377 --> 03:32.880
She's got a fella. Kisses him, too!

03:34.548 --> 03:36.717
Go on with Lucy and help with supper.

03:36.842 --> 03:38.510
Deborah, you too!

03:41.638 --> 03:45.058
I was just gonna ask Uncle Ethan
what he's gonna do with his saber.

03:45.184 --> 03:47.895
Well, I kind of figured to give it to you.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.397
Thanks. Thanks, Uncle Ethan.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.487
- How was California?
- California? How should I know?

03:58.322 --> 04:00.407
- Well, Mose Harper told us...
- Mose Harper?

04:00.442 --> 04:02.910
Is that old goat still creekin' around?

04:03.535 --> 04:05.621
Why doesn't somebody bury him?

04:06.121 --> 04:08.540
No, I ain't been to California.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.834
I don't intend to go either.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.545
Supper will be ready
as soon as you wash up.

04:13.629 --> 04:15.422
Let me take your coat.

04:26.350 --> 04:28.143
Welcome home, Ethan.

04:30.229 --> 04:31.480
Thanks, Aaron.

04:45.244 --> 04:46.912
Marty, it's Uncle Ethan!

04:47.412 --> 04:48.872
Debbie, sit down.

04:52.334 --> 04:54.086
Good evening, Uncle Ethan.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.754
Welcome home, sir.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.424
It's Martin. Martin Pawley.

05:01.510 --> 05:03.887
I'm sorry for bein' late, Aunt Martha.

05:14.523 --> 05:17.568
A fella could mistake you for a half-breed.

05:18.193 --> 05:21.822
Not quite, I'm an eighth Cherokee
and the rest Welsh and English.

05:22.573 --> 05:24.241
Least that's what they tell me.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.492
Go on, son.

05:25.527 --> 05:28.412
It was Ethan who found you
squallin' under a sage clump...

05:28.495 --> 05:30.497
after your folks had been massacred.

05:30.581 --> 05:34.042
It just happened to be me.
No need to make more of it.

05:40.507 --> 05:41.967
Thank you, Lucy.

06:05.115 --> 06:07.075
Good night, Aunt Martha.

06:08.744 --> 06:10.120
Good night, Martin.

06:10.204 --> 06:12.414
- Uncle Aaron.
- Good night, Martin.

06:13.332 --> 06:15.000
Good night, Uncle Ethan.

06:15.334 --> 06:16.460
Good night.

06:18.128 --> 06:19.796
Good night, Ma. 'Night, Pa.

06:19.922 --> 06:22.216
Uncle Ethan, will you tell us
about the war?

06:22.299 --> 06:24.384
The war ended three years ago, boy.

06:24.510 --> 06:27.221
It did? So why didn't you come home
before now?

06:27.429 --> 06:29.806
Ben, go on with Martin. March!

06:35.562 --> 06:40.150
Lucy's wearing the gold locket
you gave her when she was a little girl.

06:40.567 --> 06:44.196
She doesn't wear it much
on account of it makes her neck green.

06:45.155 --> 06:46.406
Well, it does!

06:46.823 --> 06:49.826
But, I wouldn't care
if you gave me a gold locket...

06:49.952 --> 06:52.246
if it made my neck green or not.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.874
A gold locket!
Lucy, where are my saddlebags?

07:15.477 --> 07:17.479
Look at my gold locket!

07:18.522 --> 07:20.190
Oh, it is pretty.

07:21.441 --> 07:24.653
- Ethan, I think she's too young...
- Oh, let her have it.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.489
It doesn't amount to much.

07:27.524 --> 07:29.575
- To bed, young lady!
- Yes, Daddy.

07:37.374 --> 07:40.627
I passed the Todd place comin' in.
What happened?

07:41.461 --> 07:44.381
He gave up, quit,
went back to chopping cotton.

07:44.590 --> 07:46.341
So did the Jamisons.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.178
Without Martha....

07:51.346 --> 07:53.557
She just wouldn't let a man quit.

07:54.057 --> 07:56.768
Ethan, I saw it in you before the war.

07:57.394 --> 07:59.188
You wanted to clear out.

07:59.223 --> 08:01.899
You stayed beyond any real reason. Why?

08:02.399 --> 08:04.693
Are you asking me to clear out now?

08:05.444 --> 08:06.695
You're my brother, Ethan.

08:06.778 --> 08:09.489
You're welcome to stay here
as long as you have a mind to.

08:09.615 --> 08:10.741
Ain't that right, Martha?

08:10.866 --> 08:13.785
- Of course, it is.
- I expect to pay my way.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.705
There are 60 double eagles in there.

08:17.206 --> 08:20.125
And twice that much here. Yankee dollars.

08:23.462 --> 08:25.130
That's fresh minted.

08:25.756 --> 08:27.216
There ain't a mark on it.

08:27.341 --> 08:28.383
So?

09:22.479 --> 09:24.273
Open up! It's Sam Clayton.

09:34.700 --> 09:36.577
Reverend, come on in!

09:37.077 --> 09:39.079
Good morning, Sister Edwards.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.125
What is it, Reverend?

09:43.250 --> 09:45.961
Lars just said somebody
busted into his corral last night...

09:46.044 --> 09:47.838
and ran off with his best cows.

09:47.921 --> 09:50.549
Yeah, next time I'll raise pigs, by golly!

09:50.632 --> 09:53.552
You never hear of anyone runnin' off pigs,
I bet you!

09:53.677 --> 09:56.805
- Bumblebees, by golly!
- Coffee'll be just fine, Sister.

09:57.014 --> 09:58.473
Good morning, Lucy.

09:58.557 --> 10:00.225
Debbie, you been baptized yet?

10:00.350 --> 10:03.478
- No, sir, I haven't. No.
- Aaron, get Martin, will you?

10:06.190 --> 10:08.984
I can sure use that coffee.
Pass the sugar, son.

10:11.612 --> 10:14.114
Wait a minute, Sister.
I didn't get any coffee yet.

10:14.198 --> 10:18.160
Just hold on a second, Sister.
I'm sure fond of them doughnuts.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.830
Aaron! Martin! Come on up here.

10:22.664 --> 10:23.707
Come on.

10:23.742 --> 10:26.210
- Raise your right hand. Martin?
- Yes, sir.

10:26.245 --> 10:27.753
Raise your right hand.

10:27.878 --> 10:31.840
You're hereby voluntary privates
in Company A of the Texas Rangers...

10:32.132 --> 10:35.469
- and you will faithfully discharge...
- Can I go with you?

10:35.677 --> 10:38.597
- Quiet! Where was I?
- Faithfully fulfill.

10:39.556 --> 10:41.099
You will faithfully discharge your...

10:41.225 --> 10:41.850
Mrs. Edwards?

10:41.885 --> 10:43.185
Shut up!

10:44.353 --> 10:47.564
You will faithfully discharge your duties,
as such...

10:47.689 --> 10:50.609
without a recompense
or monetary consideration.

10:50.901 --> 10:53.737
Amen. That means no pay.
Better get a shirt on, Aaron.

10:53.820 --> 10:56.865
I ain't goin' volunteering till
I've had my coffee. Drink your own.

10:56.900 --> 10:58.408
Just call me "Captain."

10:58.534 --> 11:01.537
Captain.
The Reverend Samuel Johnson Clayton!

11:02.079 --> 11:03.539
Mighty impressive.

11:06.124 --> 11:08.126
Well... the "Prodigal Brother"!

11:08.210 --> 11:11.880
When did you get back?
I ain't seen you since the surrender.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.883
Come to think of it,
I didn't see you at the surrender.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.969
I don't believe in surrenders.

11:17.719 --> 11:19.805
I still got my saber, Reverend.

11:19.888 --> 11:22.391
Didn't turn it into no plowshare neither.

11:22.724 --> 11:24.810
The Indians did it, Mrs. Edwards.

11:24.893 --> 11:27.938
Caddos or Kiowas.
Old Mose knows. Yes, sir.

11:28.564 --> 11:30.732
- Oh, shut up, Mose.
- Thank you.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.903
Ethan, I'm countin' on you
to look after things while I'm gone.

11:35.028 --> 11:38.574
- You're not goin'.
- He is going. I already swore him in.

11:38.782 --> 11:41.785
- Swear him out! I'll go with you.
- Ethan, I don't think I should...

11:41.910 --> 11:43.245
Stay close, Aaron.

11:43.996 --> 11:45.956
It might be, this is rustlers.

11:46.081 --> 11:49.084
Might be this dodderin' ol' idiot
ain't so far wrong.

11:49.209 --> 11:50.669
Could be Comanches.

11:50.704 --> 11:53.380
Kind words, Ethan. Thank you kindly.

11:54.089 --> 11:56.091
Children, go with Lucy.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.139
All right. I'll swear you in.

12:02.347 --> 12:04.641
No need to. It wouldn't be legal anyway.

12:04.676 --> 12:07.561
Why not? You wanted for a crime, Ethan?

12:09.438 --> 12:10.772
Coffee, Ethan.

12:11.106 --> 12:12.566
Thank you, Martha.

12:13.066 --> 12:16.403
Are you asking me as a captain
or a preacher, Sam?

12:17.779 --> 12:20.699
I'm asking you as a ranger
of the sovereign state of Texas.

12:20.782 --> 12:22.159
You got a warrant?

12:22.194 --> 12:24.244
You fit a lot of descriptions.

12:24.661 --> 12:27.998
I figure a man's only good
for one oath at a time.

12:28.499 --> 12:31.752
I took mine
to the Confederate States of America.

12:32.377 --> 12:33.921
So did you, Sam.

12:35.172 --> 12:36.548
Stay close, Aaron.

12:38.217 --> 12:40.594
Thank you, Mrs. Edwards.
We have to be going.

12:40.719 --> 12:42.387
Thank you, Mrs. Edwards.

12:42.596 --> 12:46.141
Grateful to the hospitality
of your rocking chair, ma'am.

12:56.568 --> 12:58.946
"Brad and Lucy, Lucy and Brad"

13:00.405 --> 13:03.325
Debbie and Ben Edwards,
I'm gonna tell Ma on you!

14:53.227 --> 14:55.646
Somethin' mighty fishy
about this trail, Uncle Ethan.

14:55.729 --> 14:58.774
Don't call me "Uncle." I ain't your uncle.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.442
Yes, sir.

15:00.859 --> 15:03.237
No need to call me "sir" either.

15:03.779 --> 15:07.741
Nor "grandpa," nor "Methuselah."
I can whip you to a frazzle.

15:09.284 --> 15:10.869
What do you want me to call you?

15:10.953 --> 15:15.040
My name is Ethan. Now what's
so mighty fishy about this trail?

15:15.874 --> 15:18.043
- Well, first...
- Look! Look!

15:37.229 --> 15:38.605
Reverend!

15:40.691 --> 15:41.733
Look!

15:56.540 --> 15:58.500
Caddos or Kiowas, huh?

16:01.336 --> 16:04.047
Ain't but one tribe uses a lance like that.

16:04.464 --> 16:07.801
Hey, Pa, your prize bull.
Killed every one of them!

16:09.678 --> 16:13.015
And not for food either.
Why'd they do a thing like that?

16:13.223 --> 16:15.809
Stealing the cattle was
just to pull us out.

16:16.226 --> 16:17.811
This is a murder raid.

16:18.020 --> 16:21.857
Shapes up to burn down either your place,
or my brother's.

16:22.816 --> 16:24.276
Mama! Laurie!

16:25.402 --> 16:27.696
Oh, please, God! Please, no!

16:34.286 --> 16:36.038
Jorgensen's place is the closest, Ethan.

16:36.163 --> 16:39.166
If they're not there,
we'll come straight on to you.

16:40.751 --> 16:41.877
You do that.

16:42.711 --> 16:44.922
Well, are you coming, or ain't you?

16:45.130 --> 16:49.510
That farm's 40 miles from here, boy.
And these horses need rest and grain.

17:00.771 --> 17:03.482
Ain't Caddos. Ain't Kiowas.

17:13.909 --> 17:16.829
- Break out the grain.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

17:45.607 --> 17:46.733
Quiet, boy.

18:15.929 --> 18:19.600
I'll see if I can shoot a couple
of sage hens before supper.

18:20.017 --> 18:21.977
Yes, you do that, Aaron.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.319
Ma, the days are getting shorter.

18:30.444 --> 18:32.529
Lucy, we don't need a lamp yet.

18:33.655 --> 18:35.866
Let's just enjoy the dusk.

18:46.376 --> 18:49.296
It's all right, Ma,
I've been watching. Only...

18:49.505 --> 18:52.216
- What, Ben?
- I wish Uncle Ethan was here.

18:52.424 --> 18:53.675
Don't you, Ma?

19:06.939 --> 19:09.858
Close that shutter, Ben, like a good boy.

19:47.062 --> 19:49.481
We're gonna play the "sleep-out" game.
Remember?

19:49.565 --> 19:50.845
Where you hide out with Grandma?

19:50.941 --> 19:52.609
Where she is buried?

19:52.644 --> 19:55.612
And you creep along the ditch
very quietly, like...

19:56.154 --> 19:57.406
Like a little mouse.

19:57.489 --> 19:59.491
Hurry up! The moon's fixin' to rise!

19:59.526 --> 20:03.120
You won't make a sound or come back,
no matter what you hear!

20:03.662 --> 20:05.539
- Promise?
- I promise.

20:07.207 --> 20:10.836
- Wait. Can't I have my doll?
- There's no time. There's no time.

20:18.135 --> 20:19.720
Now, down low. Run!

20:33.692 --> 20:36.486
Chris, go back. Go back, Chris! Go back!

21:19.238 --> 21:20.405
Wait a minute, Uncle Ethan.

21:20.489 --> 21:23.325
Next time you'll mind your Uncle Ethan.

21:23.742 --> 21:27.162
- Thank you kindly....
- Wait, Mose! We can ride double, Mose!

22:50.287 --> 22:51.747
Aunt Martha!

22:56.752 --> 22:58.212
Let me in.

22:58.420 --> 23:00.923
- Don't go in there, boy.
- I know she's in there!

23:00.958 --> 23:02.174
Don't go in!

23:05.093 --> 23:07.179
Don't let him look in there.

23:08.305 --> 23:10.390
It won't do him any good.

23:54.393 --> 23:56.186
Put an "Amen" to it!

23:57.437 --> 23:59.940
There's no more time for praying. Amen!

24:26.425 --> 24:29.553
Those girls mean as much to me
as though they were my own.

24:29.595 --> 24:33.056
Maybe you don't know that my Brad
has been keeping company with Lucy.

24:33.182 --> 24:36.101
I'd be obliged
if you'd come to the point, ma'am.

24:36.393 --> 24:38.353
It's just that I know
Martha would want you...

24:38.520 --> 24:40.814
to take care of her boys,
as well as her girls.

24:40.856 --> 24:45.444
If the girls are dead, don't let
the boys waste their lives in vengeance.

24:46.904 --> 24:48.697
Promise me, Ethan!

24:49.364 --> 24:51.450
Come on, if you're going with us!

25:19.019 --> 25:20.604
Captain Clayton!

25:44.169 --> 25:46.672
Another one, huh?
Give me a hand, Charlie.

25:57.516 --> 26:00.227
This one came a long way
before he died, Captain.

26:00.310 --> 26:04.189
Well, Ethan, there's another one
you can score up for your brother.

26:06.358 --> 26:08.652
- I don't like it!
- What don't you like?

26:08.777 --> 26:11.363
Indians on a raid generally
hide their dead.

26:11.488 --> 26:13.991
If they don't care anything
about us knowin'...

26:14.026 --> 26:15.951
it only spells one thing:

26:16.160 --> 26:20.122
They ain't afraid of us following,
or of us catchin' up with them either.

26:20.247 --> 26:23.167
You can back out
any time you want, Nesby.

26:24.710 --> 26:27.838
Ethan, I didn't say that!
I didn't say such!

26:28.589 --> 26:30.257
Easy, Nesby, easy.

26:37.139 --> 26:39.224
Why don't you finish the job?

26:48.400 --> 26:49.943
What good did that do you?

26:50.068 --> 26:53.697
By what you preach, none.
But what that Comanche believes...

26:54.323 --> 26:56.617
ain't got no eyes,
he can't enter the Spirit Land.

26:56.742 --> 26:59.244
Has to wander forever between the winds.

26:59.453 --> 27:02.372
You get it, Reverend.
Come on, Blankethead!

27:09.463 --> 27:11.548
All right, boys. Let's mount up.

27:23.018 --> 27:26.146
They're camped by the river,
about 20 miles from here.

27:28.440 --> 27:33.028
We'll wait till dark, then circle out
so we can jump 'em before daylight.

27:34.571 --> 27:37.074
You're sure you want to jump 'em, Ethan?

27:39.701 --> 27:41.578
That's what we came for, ain't it?

27:41.662 --> 27:45.123
I thought we were tryin'
to get them girls out... alive.

27:46.041 --> 27:49.503
If we jump them Comanches,
they'll kill 'em. You know that.

27:49.920 --> 27:52.005
What are we doing then, Reverend?

27:52.214 --> 27:53.966
What are we supposed to do, Ethan?

27:54.091 --> 27:58.053
Well, what I had in mind was
maybe runnin' off their pony herd.

27:59.096 --> 28:01.890
A Comanche on foot
is more apt to be willin' to listen.

28:02.015 --> 28:04.101
Yeah, I think the Reverend's right.
Don't you?

28:04.136 --> 28:06.395
You think the Reverend's....

28:06.812 --> 28:11.066
What does a quarter-breed Cherokee
know about the old Comanche trick...

28:11.817 --> 28:15.362
of sleepin' with his best pony
tied right by his side?

28:15.779 --> 28:19.116
You've got about as much chance
of stampeding that herd as...

28:19.151 --> 28:22.870
As you have of finding them girls alive
by raidin' into 'em!

28:23.495 --> 28:26.498
I say we do it my way.
And that's an order!

28:27.249 --> 28:28.292
Yes, sir.

28:29.126 --> 28:30.794
But if you're wrong...

28:31.837 --> 28:33.922
don't ever give me another!

29:15.714 --> 29:17.299
Well, they were here.

29:17.591 --> 29:19.468
Sure. They were here.

29:20.219 --> 29:23.138
And now they're out there,
waiting to jump us.

29:24.264 --> 29:26.058
Any more orders, "Captain"?

29:26.683 --> 29:28.769
Yes. We'll keep on going.

29:40.030 --> 29:41.073
Well?

29:41.907 --> 29:43.575
You want to quit, Ethan?

29:44.201 --> 29:45.953
That'll be the day!

29:47.329 --> 29:48.997
- Horses!
- Horses!

30:01.510 --> 30:02.845
Keep on going.

30:47.472 --> 30:49.683
Keep moving! Keep moving!

31:24.510 --> 31:28.263
Well, Reverend, it looks like
you got yourself surrounded.

31:28.889 --> 31:31.808
Yeah, and I figure
I can get myself un-surrounded.

31:32.100 --> 31:34.186
Mose, how far is the river?

31:35.562 --> 31:38.899
I've been baptized, Reverend.
I've been baptized.

31:39.942 --> 31:43.153
- Shut up, you fool.
- Thank you, kindly. Thank you.

31:43.904 --> 31:46.406
You'd better get yourself set
for another one...

31:46.490 --> 31:50.369
because when I holler,
I want you to move out in a hurry!

31:56.208 --> 31:57.334
Let's go!

32:44.381 --> 32:47.301
- Take it easy, Nesby.
- You'll be all right, Nesby.

33:17.623 --> 33:21.084
Here is my Bible. Hold it.
It'll make you feel good.

33:23.587 --> 33:26.089
Thank you, Reverend.
Thank you very kindly.

33:30.552 --> 33:32.554
Do you think they'll charge us?

33:33.889 --> 33:35.974
- Are you asking me?
- I am.

33:36.517 --> 33:38.060
Well, thank you.

33:38.602 --> 33:40.479
Yep. The Death Song.

33:41.313 --> 33:43.899
The War Chief. He's got to, to save face.

33:45.275 --> 33:48.612
Yes, sir. He'll be right in your lap
in a minute, sonny.

33:50.906 --> 33:54.743
For that which we're about to receive,
we thank Thee, O Lord.

34:34.699 --> 34:36.368
You got him, Marty!

34:52.426 --> 34:53.886
Hallelujah!

34:56.054 --> 34:57.431
Dang! Blast it!

34:58.140 --> 34:59.808
Watch it, it's loaded!

35:32.132 --> 35:34.551
Leave them to carry off their hurt
and dead.

35:34.635 --> 35:36.929
Well, Reverend, that does it!

35:37.346 --> 35:41.433
From now on, you stay out of this,
all of you! I don't want you with me.

35:42.142 --> 35:44.645
I don't need you for what I've gotta do!

35:55.697 --> 35:58.325
Well, Edwards, I guess you're right.

35:59.159 --> 36:00.911
We gotta get Nesby back.

36:01.453 --> 36:03.413
This is a job for a whole company
of rangers...

36:03.539 --> 36:05.833
or it's a job for one or two men.

36:06.458 --> 36:08.961
Right now, we're too many
and not enough.

36:09.878 --> 36:11.880
Me, I'm going on alone.

36:13.757 --> 36:15.008
Any objections?

36:15.217 --> 36:16.343
Good luck.

36:19.054 --> 36:22.808
There's only one way you can stop me
from looking for Lucy, mister...

36:22.933 --> 36:24.601
and that's kill me!

36:25.227 --> 36:27.396
That's the way I feel, Uncle Ethan.

36:30.941 --> 36:34.069
All right. But I'm giving the orders,
you hear?

36:34.194 --> 36:36.155
I'm givin' the orders...

36:36.280 --> 36:39.199
and you'll follow 'em
or we're splittin' up right here and now.

36:39.283 --> 36:40.742
Sure, Ethan.

36:41.577 --> 36:45.873
There's just one reason we're here,
ain't it? It's to find Debbie and Lucy.

36:50.460 --> 36:52.212
If they're still alive.

36:57.342 --> 36:58.594
Mount up.

37:25.287 --> 37:27.039
They gotta stop sometime.

37:28.081 --> 37:30.709
If they're human men at all,
they gotta stop!

37:31.210 --> 37:34.755
No, a human rides a horse until it dies,
then he goes on afoot.

37:36.632 --> 37:41.011
A Comanche comes along, gets that
horse up, rides him 20 more miles...

37:42.179 --> 37:43.931
and then he eats him.

37:44.681 --> 37:46.141
Easy on that!

37:47.059 --> 37:48.101
Sorry.

37:49.061 --> 37:51.772
We don't even know if Debbie
and Lucy are in this bunch.

37:51.807 --> 37:52.898
Maybe they split up.

37:53.023 --> 37:55.400
They're with 'em, all right.
If they're still alive.

37:55.526 --> 37:57.402
You've said that enough!

37:57.694 --> 38:00.531
Maybe Lucy's dead.
Maybe they're both dead.

38:01.031 --> 38:04.368
But, if I hear that from you again,
I'll fight you, Mr. Edwards!

38:04.493 --> 38:06.245
That'll be the day!

38:12.626 --> 38:13.752
Spread out!

38:23.554 --> 38:25.347
Found a main trail, but...

38:26.056 --> 38:29.601
four of them cut out here
and rode on up through that pass.

38:30.561 --> 38:32.646
How come they'd do that, Ethan?

38:33.272 --> 38:36.191
I'll take a look. Keep after the others.

38:36.483 --> 38:38.068
If you want us to fire...

38:38.152 --> 38:40.988
No, nor build bonfires, nor beat drums.

38:41.613 --> 38:43.699
I'll meet you on the far side.

38:44.950 --> 38:45.950
Move!

39:22.905 --> 39:24.865
Do you want some water, Ethan?

39:38.003 --> 39:39.796
The trail leads over there.

39:40.214 --> 39:41.757
Why'd they break off?

39:44.259 --> 39:46.261
Was there water in that canyon?

39:46.553 --> 39:47.553
Huh?

39:49.681 --> 39:50.724
No water.

39:52.309 --> 39:53.977
Are you all right, Ethan?

39:54.269 --> 39:55.521
I'm all right.

40:01.485 --> 40:04.488
What happened to your coat?
Did you lose it?

40:05.656 --> 40:07.115
I must have.

40:08.033 --> 40:10.035
But I'm not going back for it!

40:29.429 --> 40:31.598
I found 'em! I found Lucy!

40:33.809 --> 40:38.272
They're camped a half-mile over. I was
swinging back and I saw their smoke.

40:38.605 --> 40:42.151
Bellied up a ridge,
and there they were, right below me.

40:42.651 --> 40:44.236
Did you see Debbie?

40:45.487 --> 40:49.241
No, but I saw Lucy all right.
She was wearing that blue dress...

40:49.449 --> 40:51.535
What you saw wasn't Lucy.

40:51.618 --> 40:52.870
Oh, but it was...

40:52.995 --> 40:54.872
What you saw was a buck...

40:54.907 --> 40:56.748
wearin' Lucy's dress.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.502
I found Lucy back in the canyon.

41:02.254 --> 41:04.339
I wrapped her in my coat.

41:06.550 --> 41:08.635
Buried her with my own hands.

41:09.553 --> 41:12.389
I thought it best to keep it from you.

41:15.184 --> 41:16.560
Did they....

41:17.269 --> 41:18.437
Was she...?

41:18.520 --> 41:22.191
What do you want me to do?
Draw you a picture? Spell it out?

41:23.108 --> 41:26.987
Don't ever ask me! As long as you live,
don't ever ask me more!

41:52.095 --> 41:53.972
I'm awful sorry, Brad.

41:56.266 --> 41:57.518
Wait a minute!

42:00.354 --> 42:02.940
Get back here, Brad! Get back here!

42:54.867 --> 42:56.743
Why don't you say it?

42:57.911 --> 42:59.872
We're beaten, and you know it.

43:02.791 --> 43:05.419
Our turnin' back don't mean nothin'.

43:06.336 --> 43:07.921
Not in the long run.

43:08.964 --> 43:12.593
If she's alive, she's safe.
For a while, they'll keep her...

43:13.552 --> 43:16.555
and they'll raise her
as one of their own until...

43:17.806 --> 43:19.892
she's of an age to....

43:22.102 --> 43:25.522
Do you think maybe there's a chance
we still might find her?

43:25.856 --> 43:29.610
An Indian will chase a thing
till he thinks he's chased it enough.

43:31.069 --> 43:32.404
Then he quits.

43:32.821 --> 43:34.615
Same way when he runs.

43:35.324 --> 43:38.577
Seems like he never learns
there's such a thing as...

43:39.203 --> 43:41.705
a critter who'll just keep coming on.

43:42.748 --> 43:45.459
So we'll find 'em in the end.
I promise you.

43:46.084 --> 43:47.544
We'll find 'em...

43:48.253 --> 43:51.298
just as sure as the
turnin' of the earth!

44:42.808 --> 44:44.476
- Hi, Ethan.
- Hello, sir.

44:46.436 --> 44:48.438
- Hi, Marty.
- How are you, sir?

44:59.074 --> 45:01.869
You got my letter about your son, Brad?

45:03.871 --> 45:06.165
Just about this time a year ago.

45:10.002 --> 45:12.212
Oh, Ethan, this country....

45:30.856 --> 45:35.152
Him? Probably forgotten all about you,
can't even call your name to mind!

45:35.861 --> 45:37.446
Her name is Laurie.

45:40.157 --> 45:42.743
But I fairly forgot just
how pretty she was.

45:58.300 --> 46:00.052
What about Debbie?

46:12.064 --> 46:14.149
Hey, what are you doin' anyway?

46:16.318 --> 46:18.195
Don't go taking that stuff!

46:19.029 --> 46:21.114
Well, it ain't worth the mending.

46:21.240 --> 46:24.159
What are you gettin' so red in the face
about? I got brothers, ain't I?

46:24.243 --> 46:26.328
Yeah, well, I ain't one of them.

46:26.745 --> 46:29.039
Look here, Martin Pawley, I'm a woman.

46:29.248 --> 46:32.292
We women wash and mend
your dirty clothes all your lives.

46:32.376 --> 46:34.378
When you're little, we even wash you!

46:34.413 --> 46:37.589
How you can ever make out to be bashful
in front of a woman, I'll never know.

46:37.714 --> 46:40.509
You talk like a fella just
might as well run around naked.

46:40.634 --> 46:42.386
It wouldn't bother me none.

46:45.097 --> 46:48.433
Sure wouldn't try it in front
of Pa, though, if I was you!

46:54.273 --> 46:56.900
"Oh, I got a gal prettier than you"

47:03.991 --> 47:08.245
We kept trackin' 'em till the blizzards
hit. Then we lost their trail.

47:09.621 --> 47:13.876
Fort Richardson, Wingate, Cobb....

47:17.129 --> 47:20.132
Trouble is, we don't know which band
the war party belonged to.

47:20.257 --> 47:22.551
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.

47:22.586 --> 47:24.219
I got your boy killed.

47:24.511 --> 47:26.180
Don't go blamin' yourself for that.

47:26.305 --> 47:30.267
It's this country that killed my boy.
Yes, by golly, I tell you Ethan...

47:30.559 --> 47:33.812
Now, Lars, it just so happens
we'd be Texicans.

47:35.272 --> 47:38.400
A Texican is nothing but a human man
way out on a limb.

47:38.442 --> 47:40.110
This year and next....

47:40.903 --> 47:44.656
Maybe for a hundred more.
But I don't think it will be forever.

47:45.449 --> 47:48.869
Some day this country's gonna be
a fine good place to be.

47:49.495 --> 47:53.248
Maybe it needs our bones in the ground
before that time can come.

47:53.790 --> 47:54.833
Bedtime.

47:55.751 --> 47:57.753
She was a schoolteacher.

47:58.795 --> 48:00.672
Ma, Marty's drawers is a sight.

48:00.756 --> 48:02.633
Would it be all right
if we give him some of Brad's things?

48:02.758 --> 48:04.510
Of course. They're in Grandma's chest.

48:04.635 --> 48:07.012
Ethan, you're going to sleep
in the bunkhouse.

48:07.179 --> 48:10.933
The letter! In the chest!
It came for you, Ethan, last winter.

48:11.099 --> 48:12.976
Charlie McCorry brought it.

48:15.896 --> 48:20.150
I'm looking for that letter
Charlie McCorry.... By Jiminy!

48:27.366 --> 48:29.743
Here it is. By golly, I forgot.

48:35.165 --> 48:36.542
Excuse me.

48:51.265 --> 48:53.058
Take a look at this.

48:53.433 --> 48:54.476
Just a snip of calico.

48:54.560 --> 48:57.813
Ever see it before?
Maybe on a dress Debbie wore?

49:01.358 --> 49:03.235
Yes, it was an apron.

49:04.278 --> 49:06.029
Have they found her yet?

49:07.698 --> 49:08.866
Not yet.

49:12.828 --> 49:13.954
Not yet.

49:17.708 --> 49:19.710
You might at least have
left me my britches!

49:19.793 --> 49:22.212
It's time for bed anyway.
Here, try these on.

49:22.296 --> 49:23.547
I ain't gonna.

49:24.798 --> 49:27.301
Well, likely they'll need some takin' in.

49:27.426 --> 49:29.094
You're that gaunt.

49:29.720 --> 49:31.889
Ma's having turkey for dinner tomorrow.

49:32.014 --> 49:34.516
Laurie, come. Let the boys get to bed.

49:35.434 --> 49:36.685
All right, Pa.

49:42.316 --> 49:44.735
- Good night, Marty.
- Good night, Laurie.

49:45.235 --> 49:47.863
- 'Night, Mr. Edwards.
- 'Night, Ms. Jorgensen.

49:54.745 --> 49:57.539
Jorgensen's been runnin'
my cattle with his own.

49:58.790 --> 50:00.167
Your cattle?

50:01.001 --> 50:02.669
You mean Debbie's cattle.

50:02.961 --> 50:07.674
He's agreed to take you on and split
the increase in my herd while I'm gone.

50:08.509 --> 50:10.177
I'm pushin' on tomorrow.

50:10.594 --> 50:12.888
Well, I sure ain't gonna stay here!

50:12.971 --> 50:15.390
I started out lookin' for Debbie,
I intend to keep on.

50:15.425 --> 50:16.225
Why?

50:16.260 --> 50:18.602
Why? Well, because she is my...

50:19.228 --> 50:22.481
She's your nothing!
She's no kin to you at all!

50:24.024 --> 50:26.109
I always kind of thought she was.

50:26.860 --> 50:29.029
The way her folks took me in
and raised me....

50:29.154 --> 50:30.823
That don't make you no kin.

50:30.906 --> 50:34.159
All right, maybe it don't.
But I intend to keep on lookin' anyway.

50:34.194 --> 50:35.285
How?

50:35.410 --> 50:37.913
You got any horses, or money to buy 'em?

50:37.948 --> 50:40.415
You ain't even got money for cartridges.

50:40.624 --> 50:43.210
Jorgensen's offerin' you
a good livin' here.

50:47.798 --> 50:49.675
Martin, I want you to know...

50:49.800 --> 50:51.885
I know what you want me to know!

50:52.094 --> 50:54.596
I've got no kin, no money, no horses!

50:55.097 --> 50:58.350
All I got here is a bunch
of dead-man's clothes to wear!

50:58.976 --> 51:01.687
You told me that already,
so, shut your mouth!

51:14.491 --> 51:16.076
Mornin', Laurie.

51:16.160 --> 51:18.370
Mornin', Marty. Did you sleep well?

51:18.871 --> 51:20.247
Well, no.

51:21.707 --> 51:23.667
I kind of tossed and...

51:24.209 --> 51:26.086
turned and dreamed.

51:40.893 --> 51:42.436
I'll get your coffee.

51:44.855 --> 51:46.732
You know, Laurie, I...

51:46.940 --> 51:50.903
I was thinking maybe it's time
you and me started goin' steady, huh?

51:53.071 --> 51:56.617
You and me have been goin' steady
since we was three years old.

51:57.034 --> 51:59.953
- We have?
- About time you found out about it!

52:02.372 --> 52:05.083
Gosh, Laurie, I've always been fond
of you, but...

52:05.167 --> 52:08.086
with all this trouble
with Debbie and Ethan, I....

52:08.212 --> 52:09.880
Ethan rode on an hour ago.

52:11.215 --> 52:14.676
I don't know what you can do
about findin' Debbie that he can't.

52:14.760 --> 52:17.471
He'll find her now, Martin. Honest he will!

52:17.679 --> 52:21.141
That's what I'm afraid of, Laurie,
him finding her!

52:22.392 --> 52:25.312
I've seen his eyes
at the very word "Comanche."

52:26.563 --> 52:28.649
I've seen him take his knife and...

52:30.400 --> 52:32.200
Never mind. He's a man
that can go crazy wild!

52:32.229 --> 52:35.322
And I intend to be there to stop him,
in case he does.

52:35.948 --> 52:39.493
I was hopin' I could hold you here,
but I guess I knew better.

52:42.704 --> 52:44.289
I stole that for you.

52:53.882 --> 52:55.551
"I... bought...."

52:56.468 --> 52:58.345
Here, let me read it for you.

53:00.138 --> 53:02.641
"I bought a small-sized dress
off of an Indian.

53:02.724 --> 53:06.395
"If this here's a piece of your
child's dress, bring the reward.

53:06.430 --> 53:09.106
"I know where they've gone.
Jerem Futterman."

53:11.608 --> 53:15.154
He's got a small trading post
on the south fork of the Brazos.

53:15.189 --> 53:17.865
Listen, I just gotta get me a horse!
Do you think your Pa...

53:17.900 --> 53:18.574
Finish your breakfast!

53:18.699 --> 53:20.242
I've got to find him!

53:21.410 --> 53:25.247
- All right, go on and find him!
- Oh, Laurie, don't you understand?

53:36.633 --> 53:38.594
But that's your own good horse!

53:38.927 --> 53:40.596
You take him and welcome!

53:40.888 --> 53:44.141
But don't you count on findin' me here
when you get back.

53:44.224 --> 53:46.852
I've been hanging around
this Godforsaken place...

53:46.935 --> 53:49.354
for two long years waiting for you.

53:49.563 --> 53:51.732
I ain't cut out to be no old maid!

53:52.357 --> 53:56.028
I'm sorry, Laurie,
but I just gotta catch up with Ethan.

53:56.653 --> 53:58.947
Well, go ahead and catch up with him!

54:16.465 --> 54:18.008
- Futterman?
- Yeah.

54:18.550 --> 54:19.676
Let's talk.

54:25.307 --> 54:27.184
You sent me a letter.

54:27.726 --> 54:28.769
Yeah?

54:29.186 --> 54:30.437
About a dress.

54:44.201 --> 54:45.661
How'd you come by it?

54:45.696 --> 54:48.872
- You said there was a $1,000 reward.
- That's what I said.

54:48.997 --> 54:50.666
Got it with you?

54:51.083 --> 54:54.086
You'll get the reward when I find her,
and if she's still alive.

54:54.211 --> 54:56.380
A man's got a right to expect
some kind of payment.

54:56.505 --> 54:59.633
I laid out for that dress
and sendin' you that writing.

55:02.219 --> 55:03.387
Twenty Yankee dollars.

55:03.470 --> 55:05.556
A man's time is worth something.

55:06.390 --> 55:07.390
Talk.

55:10.686 --> 55:12.646
A young buck fetched it in
late last summer.

55:12.771 --> 55:15.357
Said it belonged to a captive child
of Chief Scar.

55:15.482 --> 55:16.525
Scar?

55:17.151 --> 55:18.819
We ain't never heard of him, have we?

55:18.902 --> 55:21.947
Me neither. But this buck claimed
he was a big war chief...

55:22.030 --> 55:24.324
- with the Nawyecky Comanches.
- Keep talkin'.

55:24.449 --> 55:28.287
Scar's band was headed north to winter
at Fort Wingate, eatin' agency beef.

55:28.412 --> 55:30.914
That's what this buck said. Maybe he lied.

55:31.832 --> 55:33.083
Maybe you lie.

55:33.625 --> 55:36.128
In that case, my friend,
you won't find her...

55:36.211 --> 55:38.630
and I won't get my $1,000 dollars.

55:40.090 --> 55:42.593
You can spend the night. Cards, a jug...

55:42.885 --> 55:44.136
No thanks.

55:46.138 --> 55:48.223
Don't forget to come back with my $1,000!

55:48.258 --> 55:49.766
It ain't yours yet!

55:55.522 --> 55:58.859
Do you have a feeling
that maybe we're being followed?

55:59.067 --> 56:01.445
That's the Indian in you. Go to sleep.

56:01.778 --> 56:04.490
Them horses there...
they're sure actin' mighty nervous.

56:04.573 --> 56:06.783
They smell a change in the weather.

56:15.334 --> 56:18.462
Don't put any more wood on the fire.
I'm burning up.

56:18.670 --> 56:20.839
We might get a frost before mornin'.

56:21.173 --> 56:23.675
I'm getting to be like old Mose Harper.

56:24.384 --> 56:26.178
My bones are cold tonight.

56:32.017 --> 56:36.063
It's funny, but last winter when
we passed through Fort Wingate...

56:37.231 --> 56:41.068
I didn't have any recollection of
a mention of Nawyecky Comanches.

56:41.610 --> 56:44.738
Not so funny when you recollect
what "Nawyecky" means.

56:45.030 --> 56:47.866
- What's that?
- Sort of like "roundabout."

56:48.158 --> 56:51.495
A man says he's goin' one place,
means to go to the other.

57:04.132 --> 57:07.970
Come on, Ethan. Don't put any more wood
on the fire! I'm burning up.

57:16.728 --> 57:17.896
Comfortable?

57:17.980 --> 57:19.439
Are you all right?

57:19.857 --> 57:23.527
- I'm just saying good night to you.
- Well, good night!

57:47.092 --> 57:48.427
Good night!

57:48.969 --> 57:50.429
Good night!

58:37.142 --> 58:39.019
Thanks, you did fine.

58:42.564 --> 58:44.525
Why, that's Futterman!

58:45.275 --> 58:47.236
Ethan, what are you doin' anyway?

58:47.361 --> 58:50.697
I'm getting my money back, you idiot!
What do you suppose!

58:51.740 --> 58:53.075
We did all right.

58:57.454 --> 59:01.124
We? Why you just staked me out there,
like a piece of bait!

59:01.625 --> 59:05.712
You built up the fire. You fixed it
so I could get my brains blown out!

59:06.421 --> 59:08.215
What if you had missed?

59:09.132 --> 59:10.801
It never occurred to me.

59:14.137 --> 59:16.014
Let's get out of here.

59:25.190 --> 59:27.067
Howdy, Mr. Jorgensen.

59:28.026 --> 59:30.404
- Charlie!
- Got me a letter here.

59:31.655 --> 59:33.448
By golly, a letter?

59:34.700 --> 59:36.243
It's for Ms. Laurie.

59:36.660 --> 59:39.288
Two letters in one year! By golly!

59:40.205 --> 59:42.833
Mama! Mama! It's Charlie McCorry.

59:43.542 --> 59:47.087
He's come with a letter.
He's come a courtin' too, by golly!

59:51.175 --> 59:52.843
Good morning, Charlie.

59:53.260 --> 59:56.388
Laurie, here's a letter for you.
Charlie brought it.

59:57.014 --> 01:00:00.767
I figured it might be the news
you've been waiting for, so l...

01:00:00.802 --> 01:00:02.436
- Thank you, Charlie.
- You're welcome.

01:00:02.471 --> 01:00:04.938
Say, I brought you some boiled sweets.

01:00:05.230 --> 01:00:06.482
Why, thank you, Charlie!

01:00:06.607 --> 01:00:09.401
Let's sit down
while Laurie reads the letter.

01:00:09.818 --> 01:00:12.237
I reckon, I really ought to be going...

01:00:12.738 --> 01:00:14.531
No. You'll stay, Charlie.

01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:19.119
After all, Charlie brought the letter.
He's got a right to listen too.

01:00:20.662 --> 01:00:22.539
Come on, read the letter.

01:00:24.208 --> 01:00:25.667
But, Ma, it's my letter!

01:00:25.792 --> 01:00:28.378
Why, sure, but.... Go ahead. Read it.

01:00:38.096 --> 01:00:39.139
Please.

01:00:41.016 --> 01:00:42.684
"Dear Ms. Laury..."

01:00:42.893 --> 01:00:45.813
He spelled it with a "y" instead of an
"ie." You'd think he'd know better.

01:00:45.848 --> 01:00:49.983
Oh, spelling... please!
What's the difference? Read the letter!

01:00:52.277 --> 01:00:56.031
I take pencil in hand
to let you know...

01:00:57.282 --> 01:01:01.328
"Ethan and me are still trying
to catch up with them Comanches...

01:01:01.453 --> 01:01:04.039
"the late Mr. Futterman told us about."

01:01:05.415 --> 01:01:06.875
The "late" Mr. Futterman?

01:01:06.910 --> 01:01:09.461
That means Mr. Futterman is dead,
by golly.

01:01:09.878 --> 01:01:12.089
Oh, the poor man! Go ahead, Laurie.

01:01:14.258 --> 01:01:17.094
"We cut north through Indian territory...

01:01:17.803 --> 01:01:20.013
"and did not have no trouble...

01:01:20.848 --> 01:01:23.350
"finding Kiowas and Wichitas...

01:01:23.976 --> 01:01:25.936
"and even some Comanches...

01:01:26.478 --> 01:01:28.772
"camped by one of the agencies.

01:01:29.815 --> 01:01:32.109
"But none of them was Nawyeckies...

01:01:32.401 --> 01:01:35.654
"nor claimed to know
a war chief called Scar."

01:01:37.322 --> 01:01:38.365
Scar?

01:01:41.285 --> 01:01:44.830
"He's the one the late Mr. Futterman said
had Debbie.

01:01:48.167 --> 01:01:50.252
<i>"At one of the agencies...</i>

01:01:50.878 --> 01:01:54.089
<i>"...We outfitted With all kinds of
trade goods...</i>

01:01:55.048 --> 01:01:58.886
<i>"...figuring that'd make it easier
for us to come and go....</i>

01:02:02.848 --> 01:02:05.142
<i>"You'd laugh if I told you...</i>

01:02:05.684 --> 01:02:08.187
<i>"...What Was our biggest seller. "</i>

01:02:58.445 --> 01:03:01.156
Let's go. I think I stumbled
onto something.

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:02.282
Scar... you found him?

01:03:02.407 --> 01:03:04.785
When are you gonna learn
to keep your big mouth shut?

01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:06.590
Get your horse, and let's get out of here!

01:03:06.662 --> 01:03:09.706
- I just bought me a good blanket.
- Forget it. Move!

01:03:15.546 --> 01:03:18.131
I heard that a band of hostile Comanches...

01:03:19.383 --> 01:03:21.593
came through less than a week ago.

01:03:21.677 --> 01:03:24.179
I asked if a white girl was with them.

01:03:24.930 --> 01:03:27.099
They got sullen and suspicious.

01:03:27.850 --> 01:03:30.561
- You think it might have been...
- I don't know!

01:03:35.649 --> 01:03:37.943
What's she following us for?

01:03:39.528 --> 01:03:41.488
Hey, you! You go on back now!

01:03:42.322 --> 01:03:43.365
Go on!

01:03:43.782 --> 01:03:46.827
Look, I changed my mind.
You can keep your blanket.

01:03:51.415 --> 01:03:54.209
Look, you don't understand.
I don't want it!

01:03:54.626 --> 01:03:57.254
You don't understand, you chunkhead!

01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:00.799
You didn't buy any blanket,
you bought her!

01:04:01.842 --> 01:04:03.802
You got yourself a wife, sonny!

01:04:04.761 --> 01:04:07.347
Oh, no! Ethan, tell her to go back!

01:04:07.764 --> 01:04:11.018
What? And have her whole family
after our scalps...

01:04:11.226 --> 01:04:14.438
for flauntin' one of their womenfolk?
No, sir!

01:04:15.189 --> 01:04:17.065
Come on, Mrs. Pawley.

01:04:17.483 --> 01:04:19.026
Come on, Mrs. Pawley.

01:04:19.234 --> 01:04:21.111
Join our merry group.

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:22.488
Mrs. Pawley?

01:04:27.367 --> 01:04:30.621
"There is one other thing
I got to tell you...

01:04:31.330 --> 01:04:33.832
"before you hear it from Ethan.

01:04:35.834 --> 01:04:37.711
"How I got myself...

01:04:39.254 --> 01:04:40.631
"a wife..."

01:04:41.882 --> 01:04:43.133
He did?

01:04:43.342 --> 01:04:44.468
Good!

01:04:45.010 --> 01:04:48.347
A young man should get married
early in life. Right, Mama?

01:04:52.726 --> 01:04:55.103
Go ahead and read the letter, Laurie.

01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:00.651
"A little Comanche squaw..."

01:05:04.196 --> 01:05:05.447
Squaw!

01:05:09.618 --> 01:05:12.538
Laurie, you come back
and read the letter, please!

01:05:13.455 --> 01:05:15.457
Come back and read it, please!

01:05:17.417 --> 01:05:19.837
Mama, here, you read the letter.

01:05:21.922 --> 01:05:24.925
My wife was a schoolteacher.
She reads good.

01:05:27.970 --> 01:05:29.221
I'll read it.

01:05:29.638 --> 01:05:31.932
So he married a Comanche squaw.

01:05:41.316 --> 01:05:43.068
"She wasn't near...

01:05:44.653 --> 01:05:46.405
"as old as you..."

01:05:47.865 --> 01:05:50.075
How old does he think I am?

01:05:52.369 --> 01:05:54.872
Hey, look! Coffee. Me. Coffee.

01:06:02.171 --> 01:06:04.673
Could I have a little, Mrs. Pawley?

01:06:09.678 --> 01:06:13.640
Looks like Mrs. Pawley's
gonna make you a fine, dutiful wife.

01:06:13.849 --> 01:06:15.809
Oh, cut it out, will you?

01:06:20.939 --> 01:06:23.734
Look... I sure wish
I could make you understand.

01:06:33.869 --> 01:06:37.498
She says her name is
Wild Goose Flying in The Night Sky.

01:06:38.957 --> 01:06:42.294
But she'll answer to "Look,"
if that pleases you.

01:07:15.661 --> 01:07:18.288
That's grounds for divorce in Texas!

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:23.085
You're really rough!

01:07:23.168 --> 01:07:25.796
Well, I don't think it's a dead-bird funny!

01:07:26.839 --> 01:07:31.093
Look, if you really wanna do some good,
why don't you ask her where Scar is?

01:07:36.723 --> 01:07:38.183
She heard you.

01:07:46.108 --> 01:07:47.359
You ask her!

01:07:49.361 --> 01:07:53.407
Do you know where he went?
Did he have a girl with him? A white girl?

01:07:59.872 --> 01:08:01.665
No, not a woman. It's...

01:08:04.376 --> 01:08:05.419
Sister!

01:08:32.196 --> 01:08:33.572
Look's gone!

01:08:34.698 --> 01:08:36.366
Pulled out in the night.

01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:42.747
She ain't goin' back to her family.
That's for certain.

01:08:42.783 --> 01:08:45.459
She took off the way
that arrow is pointing.

01:08:47.211 --> 01:08:48.611
Think maybe we ought to follow her?

01:08:48.670 --> 01:08:51.298
How should I know? She's your wife.

01:08:55.886 --> 01:08:58.180
<i>"Maybe she left other signs
for us to folloW but...</i>

01:08:58.263 --> 01:09:00.057
"we'll never know...

01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:03.268
"because it snowed
that day and all the next week."

01:09:07.856 --> 01:09:10.274
<i>We Were headin' north
through buff alo country...</i>

01:09:10.310 --> 01:09:14.029
<i>When somethin' happened that
I ain't got straight in my oWn mind yet.</i>

01:09:14.112 --> 01:09:16.615
<i>On this day We sighted a small herd.</i>

01:09:16.948 --> 01:09:19.326
<i>We needed meat, so We circled around...</i>

01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:21.745
<i>and came up on them on foot.</i>

01:09:59.074 --> 01:10:00.200
That don't make no sense!

01:10:00.325 --> 01:10:03.245
Hunger! Empty bellies! That's the sense!

01:10:14.715 --> 01:10:17.718
At least they won't feed
any Comanches this winter!

01:10:20.012 --> 01:10:21.263
Listen!

01:11:29.373 --> 01:11:31.542
<i>It Was the NaWyecky Comanches, all right.</i>

01:11:31.625 --> 01:11:34.336
<i>The ones We'd been looking for
all this time.</i>

01:12:07.369 --> 01:12:08.745
It's Look.

01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:15.750
What did them soldiers have
to go and kill her for?

01:12:15.836 --> 01:12:17.296
She never done nobody any harm.

01:12:17.379 --> 01:12:20.215
We've got to catch up with them,
maybe they've got Debbie with them!

01:12:20.299 --> 01:12:23.427
Maybe they've got that
chief they call Scar.

01:12:24.386 --> 01:12:26.972
<i>So, We figured Debbie'd
been in the village.</i>

01:12:27.181 --> 01:12:29.621
<i>What Look Was doin' there...
Whether she'd come to Warn 'em...</i>

01:12:29.683 --> 01:12:31.977
<i>or maybe to find Debbie for me...</i>

01:12:32.311 --> 01:12:34.188
<i>there's no Way of knoWing.</i>

01:13:18.398 --> 01:13:20.567
Come on, move along! Come on!

01:13:43.841 --> 01:13:44.883
Yes?

01:13:44.967 --> 01:13:47.469
We're looking for a girl.
A white girl. A captive.

01:13:47.594 --> 01:13:49.555
Should be about 14 now.

01:13:49.763 --> 01:13:52.182
Fourteen? We have two about that age.

01:13:53.225 --> 01:13:56.145
- All the white women are in the chapel.
- What's this girl to you?

01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:58.230
- She's my...
- She's my niece.

01:14:00.107 --> 01:14:01.233
One moment.

01:14:04.278 --> 01:14:06.238
- White women?
- Yes, sir.

01:14:32.639 --> 01:14:34.308
Will you stand up?

01:14:35.142 --> 01:14:36.602
Stand up, please.

01:14:59.833 --> 01:15:02.044
It's hard to believe they're white.

01:15:02.669 --> 01:15:04.338
They ain't white!

01:15:04.755 --> 01:15:07.257
Not any more. They are Comanches!

01:15:08.383 --> 01:15:10.177
Where are your casualties?

01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:33.325
Maybe you can help us identify them.
All white. All captives.

01:15:33.617 --> 01:15:35.619
There's the white girl there.

01:15:46.046 --> 01:15:47.046
No.

01:15:50.843 --> 01:15:54.888
"So we're setting out for New Mexico
territory in the morning.

01:15:57.307 --> 01:16:01.061
"I am sorry I won't be back
for Christmas again this year.

01:16:06.692 --> 01:16:10.320
"I set pencil aside and hope
you are enjoying good health.

01:16:10.445 --> 01:16:12.197
"And your folks the same.

01:16:12.948 --> 01:16:15.033
"I remain, respectfully...

01:16:16.493 --> 01:16:18.662
"yours truly, Martin Pawley."

01:16:20.247 --> 01:16:22.541
They'll never find that girl.

01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:26.795
Never!

01:16:35.262 --> 01:16:36.722
"Yours truly."

01:16:40.559 --> 01:16:43.187
He had to sign his whole name,
"Martin Pawley."

01:16:43.222 --> 01:16:45.272
He couldn't write just "Marty"!

01:16:47.357 --> 01:16:49.651
I don't care if he never comes back!

01:16:51.111 --> 01:16:54.656
Charlie, you stay for supper.
I won't take "no" for an answer.

01:16:54.865 --> 01:16:58.827
The thought of saying "no"
never entered my head, Mrs. Jorgensen.

01:17:00.078 --> 01:17:03.081
Ain't no place I'd rather be
than right here...

01:17:03.832 --> 01:17:05.083
right now.

01:17:07.461 --> 01:17:09.671
"Gone again, skip to my Lou

01:17:12.466 --> 01:17:14.676
"Gone again, skip to my Lou

01:17:17.679 --> 01:17:19.890
"Gone again, skip to my Lou

01:17:22.601 --> 01:17:24.770
"Skip to my Lou, my darling"

01:17:49.294 --> 01:17:50.838
- Recognize it?
- That?

01:17:52.089 --> 01:17:54.716
Couldn't be two like that
in the whole world!

01:17:56.385 --> 01:17:57.511
Mose Harper!

01:18:04.309 --> 01:18:06.395
Mose, you look shabbier than ever!

01:18:06.478 --> 01:18:08.063
How about a drink?

01:18:10.566 --> 01:18:13.569
Ain't been too good.
No, sir. Not too good.

01:18:14.111 --> 01:18:16.613
- Getting old.
- You were born old.

01:18:17.114 --> 01:18:20.450
Been helpin' you, Ethan.
Been lookin' all the time.

01:18:20.576 --> 01:18:22.536
The reward still stands.

01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:27.875
Don't want no money, Ethan.
No money, Marty.

01:18:28.917 --> 01:18:31.420
Just a roof over old Mose's head.

01:18:33.714 --> 01:18:36.091
And a rocking chair by the fire.

01:18:36.425 --> 01:18:39.011
My own rocking chair by the fire, Marty.

01:18:40.262 --> 01:18:43.515
You help us find the girl
and you've got your rocking chair.

01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:45.476
Swear it, Ethan? Given word?

01:18:45.684 --> 01:18:47.478
I told you, didn't I?

01:18:48.604 --> 01:18:51.231
Ethan, I found a man who's seen her.

01:18:52.065 --> 01:18:54.359
He knows where little Debbie is!

01:18:54.651 --> 01:18:56.737
Where is he? Who is this man?

01:18:57.154 --> 01:18:58.947
- Promise?
- Who is this man?

01:19:00.282 --> 01:19:01.950
I am this man, <i>Seńor.</i>

01:19:06.538 --> 01:19:09.875
At your service. For a price.
Always for a price.

01:19:23.972 --> 01:19:25.224
Sir, I'd like to...

01:19:25.307 --> 01:19:27.184
Wait till you grow up.

01:19:54.419 --> 01:19:56.380
Let's talk a little business.

01:19:58.465 --> 01:19:59.508
Why not?

01:20:32.166 --> 01:20:33.208
Let's go.

01:20:33.625 --> 01:20:34.877
But I'm hungry!

01:20:35.085 --> 01:20:36.545
While you're fillin' your belly...

01:20:36.628 --> 01:20:39.673
I'm goin' out to meet a Comanche
named Cicatriz.

01:20:39.882 --> 01:20:41.341
Never heard of him.

01:20:41.758 --> 01:20:44.261
"<i>Cicatriz" is Mexican for "scar."</i>

01:22:07.344 --> 01:22:09.012
Medicine country, huh?

01:22:09.763 --> 01:22:11.306
Bad medicine, I think.

01:22:35.289 --> 01:22:38.625
- This is the great Cicatriz, War Chief.
- Scar, huh?

01:22:44.798 --> 01:22:46.967
Plain to see how you got your name.

01:22:48.969 --> 01:22:50.512
You, Big Shoulders.

01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:53.974
The young one, He Who Follows.

01:22:56.059 --> 01:22:59.188
You speak pretty good American
for a Comanche.

01:23:00.647 --> 01:23:02.316
Did someone teach you?

01:23:10.449 --> 01:23:13.994
That's right. We've come to trade.
Only not out here.

01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:17.331
I don't stand talkin' in the wind.

01:23:43.273 --> 01:23:46.109
You speak good Comanche.
Did someone teach you?

01:23:48.278 --> 01:23:50.489
- You, stay out here.
- Not likely.

01:23:57.246 --> 01:24:01.416
His sons are dead. So his wives sit
on the honor side of his lodge.

01:24:07.881 --> 01:24:09.675
Are all those his wives?

01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:12.594
Two sons killed by white men.

01:24:13.846 --> 01:24:16.014
For each son, I take many....

01:24:18.642 --> 01:24:19.685
Scalps.

01:24:54.386 --> 01:24:56.180
We've seen scalps before.

01:24:58.557 --> 01:24:59.933
Seen this before?

01:25:07.441 --> 01:25:09.943
I came to trade,
not to admire his collection.

01:25:10.027 --> 01:25:14.323
Tell him we'll pitch camp on the other
side of the creek and talk tomorrow.

01:25:30.672 --> 01:25:32.341
It is not that I am afraid.

01:25:32.466 --> 01:25:34.843
Don't apologize. You got well paid.

01:25:36.512 --> 01:25:40.682
But he knows who you are,
and why you're here. This, I did not know.

01:25:43.101 --> 01:25:45.687
Take it. I do not want blood money.

01:26:04.581 --> 01:26:06.959
Do you think old Scar means to kill us?

01:26:07.918 --> 01:26:09.378
He's got to.

01:26:10.087 --> 01:26:12.589
We've been asking for it for five years.

01:26:14.675 --> 01:26:17.094
Why didn't he make his move back there?

01:26:18.554 --> 01:26:21.682
Hospitality, I guess. Comanche hospitality.

01:26:25.519 --> 01:26:27.729
Why? Do you want to pull out too?

01:26:32.818 --> 01:26:34.069
Big Shoulders!

01:26:52.546 --> 01:26:55.674
Debbie, don't you remember?
I'm Martin, your brother.

01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:57.634
Remember?

01:26:59.094 --> 01:27:00.888
Debbie, remember back....

01:27:02.347 --> 01:27:05.267
Do you remember how I used
to let you ride my horse?

01:27:06.935 --> 01:27:08.604
And tell you stories?

01:27:10.564 --> 01:27:12.566
Don't you remember me, Debbie?

01:27:13.192 --> 01:27:14.318
I remember.

01:27:15.569 --> 01:27:16.820
For always.

01:27:18.614 --> 01:27:21.617
First I prayed to you,
to come and get me...

01:27:23.285 --> 01:27:25.787
to take me home. You didn't come.

01:27:28.415 --> 01:27:29.958
I've come now, Debbie.

01:27:30.918 --> 01:27:32.461
These are my people.

01:27:34.671 --> 01:27:36.757
Go! Go, Martin! Please!

01:27:38.842 --> 01:27:40.385
Stand aside, Martin!

01:27:44.681 --> 01:27:46.225
No, you don't, Ethan!

01:27:47.184 --> 01:27:48.727
Ethan! No, you don't!

01:27:51.021 --> 01:27:52.189
Stand aside!

01:30:19.628 --> 01:30:23.173
Looks as though I'm gonna have
to open that shoulder again.

01:30:24.007 --> 01:30:25.759
To get the poison out.

01:30:26.718 --> 01:30:30.264
Sure beats me, Ethan...
how you could've stayed alive this long.

01:30:31.098 --> 01:30:32.432
Read this.

01:30:44.862 --> 01:30:45.904
"I...

01:30:47.239 --> 01:30:49.032
"Ethan Edwards...

01:30:50.576 --> 01:30:52.786
"being of a sound mind...

01:30:55.372 --> 01:30:56.540
"and...

01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:59.334
"without any blood kin...

01:31:06.341 --> 01:31:08.010
"do hereby..."

01:31:11.638 --> 01:31:13.932
Bequeath. It means "leave."

01:31:15.517 --> 01:31:16.977
"bequeath...

01:31:18.645 --> 01:31:20.522
"all my property...

01:31:22.900 --> 01:31:24.693
"of any kind...

01:31:28.113 --> 01:31:29.781
"to Martin Pawley."

01:31:33.035 --> 01:31:35.829
What do you mean,
you don't have any "blood kin"?

01:31:36.371 --> 01:31:38.123
Debbie is your blood kin!

01:31:38.248 --> 01:31:39.917
Not no more, she ain't!

01:31:40.417 --> 01:31:42.419
Well, you can keep your will!

01:31:42.836 --> 01:31:45.005
I don't want any of your property!

01:31:45.339 --> 01:31:48.759
Besides, I ain't forgettin' you was gettin'
all set to shoot her yourself.

01:31:48.884 --> 01:31:50.344
What kind of man are you anyway?

01:31:50.379 --> 01:31:53.555
- She's been livin' with a buck!
- Shut your dirty mouth!

01:32:00.562 --> 01:32:02.022
I hope you die!

01:32:03.273 --> 01:32:05.025
That'll be the day!

01:33:04.793 --> 01:33:06.879
Good evening, everybody!

01:33:09.381 --> 01:33:13.343
Here he is! All curried,
combed and washed behind the ears.

01:33:13.844 --> 01:33:16.889
Charlie, you look right handsome!
I'd hardly know you.

01:33:16.924 --> 01:33:19.892
Yes, ma'am.
I can't hardly recognize myself.

01:33:20.851 --> 01:33:22.603
Get it on, Luther!

01:33:39.703 --> 01:33:40.871
Why don't you have a drink?

01:33:40.906 --> 01:33:43.790
Oh, no, Nesby.
Not till I'm finished my clergyin'.

01:33:43.999 --> 01:33:46.293
Bar's closed. Right, Sister Jorgensen?

01:33:46.376 --> 01:33:49.004
All right, let's go! Let's get it goin'!

01:34:00.724 --> 01:34:02.100
Go ahead.

01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:06.020
Bible.

01:34:09.441 --> 01:34:11.401
- Get them spurs off!
- Yes, sir.

01:34:15.739 --> 01:34:17.825
All right, line up inside, boys.

01:34:30.254 --> 01:34:32.756
"Yes, we will gather at the river

01:34:37.803 --> 01:34:40.389
"The beautiful, the beautiful river

01:34:45.811 --> 01:34:48.438
"Gather with the saints at the river

01:34:53.068 --> 01:34:55.571
"That flows by the throne of God"

01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:12.588
Hey, you don't suppose they're
throwin' a party for us, do you?

01:35:12.629 --> 01:35:14.381
That'll be the day!

01:35:20.387 --> 01:35:21.638
I'm all right.

01:35:27.603 --> 01:35:31.565
Ethan, Martin! You can't come in!
The rangers are in there.

01:35:31.982 --> 01:35:33.233
What's that got to do with us?

01:35:33.317 --> 01:35:35.736
You're both posted for murder.
The both of you!

01:35:35.771 --> 01:35:38.238
That trader, the late Futterman....

01:35:38.655 --> 01:35:41.366
The Reverend and the rangers
are in there now....

01:35:41.401 --> 01:35:43.452
Well, what's goin' on anyway?

01:35:52.628 --> 01:35:54.713
Looks like you two will have
a lot to talk about.

01:35:54.797 --> 01:35:57.299
- Come on, Lars.
- Ethan... hide in the barn!

01:35:57.424 --> 01:35:58.467
What for?

01:36:04.598 --> 01:36:06.683
Please! Look, everybody!

01:36:07.434 --> 01:36:08.560
Look, Mama!

01:36:09.394 --> 01:36:11.063
Look who's here!

01:36:13.148 --> 01:36:14.191
Evenin'.

01:36:17.528 --> 01:36:18.987
Is the bar open?

01:36:20.030 --> 01:36:21.907
Any news of our little girl?

01:36:22.950 --> 01:36:25.160
She's not a little girl anymore.

01:36:25.369 --> 01:36:27.246
You've seen her? She's alive?

01:36:27.329 --> 01:36:29.623
I've seen her and she's alive.

01:36:31.208 --> 01:36:34.837
Good evening, Reverend.
Or should I call you "Captain"?

01:36:35.671 --> 01:36:37.881
I came here for a wedding, Ethan.

01:36:37.916 --> 01:36:41.844
Till that's over, "Reverend" will do.
Afterwards we'll talk.

01:36:41.927 --> 01:36:43.929
- Is Marty with you?
- Yep.

01:36:50.060 --> 01:36:52.896
It's good to see you back, Ethan.
We'll join you.

01:36:54.148 --> 01:36:56.233
But I wrote you one letter.

01:36:56.859 --> 01:36:58.944
One letter in five years!

01:37:00.070 --> 01:37:03.740
I read it till the paper dried up
and the writin' faded out.

01:37:06.535 --> 01:37:08.537
It wasn't much of a letter, was it?

01:37:08.620 --> 01:37:09.872
No, it wasn't.

01:37:11.540 --> 01:37:13.750
Might've at least said you loved me.

01:37:14.376 --> 01:37:18.547
You might've asked me to wait for you.
At least that'd have been somethin'.

01:37:20.507 --> 01:37:22.301
But I always loved you!

01:37:23.552 --> 01:37:26.555
I thought you knew that
without me havin' to say it.

01:37:27.514 --> 01:37:29.808
It isn't fair, Martin Pawley!

01:37:31.059 --> 01:37:32.728
It isn't fair and you know it!

01:37:32.811 --> 01:37:35.647
- I wish you wouldn't cry, Laurie.
- Who's cryin'?

01:37:44.823 --> 01:37:48.243
I reckon the best thing for me to do
is to go away.

01:37:50.537 --> 01:37:53.248
You do, Martin Pawley, and I'll just die!

01:38:05.886 --> 01:38:08.597
I'll thank you to unhand my fiancée.

01:38:13.268 --> 01:38:16.104
You don't mean you're
gonna be marryin' him?

01:38:18.607 --> 01:38:20.067
She sure is!

01:38:20.692 --> 01:38:24.112
And don't think your comin' back
is gonna change it either!

01:38:24.530 --> 01:38:27.241
Well, now, as to that,
I just don't know, Charlie.

01:38:27.366 --> 01:38:29.660
We hadn't gotten around
to talkin' about marriage.

01:38:29.695 --> 01:38:33.080
What right have you to talk marriage
to any decent woman?

01:38:33.497 --> 01:38:35.707
If you're referrin' to
that crazy murder charge...

01:38:35.791 --> 01:38:37.167
And other things.

01:38:38.210 --> 01:38:43.090
You think you're gettin' away with
bein' smart about the Indian wife you took.

01:38:46.218 --> 01:38:48.846
I'll bet she ain't the
first squaw you ever...

01:38:48.881 --> 01:38:50.597
Why, you are a no good...

01:38:53.016 --> 01:38:55.185
Oh, Marty, you've done it again!

01:38:58.522 --> 01:38:59.982
Get out of my way!

01:39:00.607 --> 01:39:03.235
Marty! Charlie! I ain't gonna have
no fightin' in my house.

01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:06.363
Well, then we're just gonna fight outside,
doggone it!

01:39:06.446 --> 01:39:08.115
I ain't totin' no firearms.

01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:10.742
Well, that sure ain't gonna be no problem.

01:39:12.494 --> 01:39:14.913
- After you, Marty.
- After you, Charlie.

01:39:22.421 --> 01:39:23.547
Look, here.

01:39:27.092 --> 01:39:28.260
Thank you.

01:39:36.810 --> 01:39:39.104
Spit over that piece of firewood.

01:39:56.830 --> 01:39:59.416
Quit that, Marty! That ain't fair!

01:40:08.717 --> 01:40:10.803
Marty, now you stop that!

01:40:20.395 --> 01:40:23.315
Is this here altercation
in the line of duty?

01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:26.860
No, sir. It's more in the nature
of a private fight.

01:40:26.895 --> 01:40:31.031
All right, then, go ahead.
But fight fair. No biting or gouging!

01:40:31.949 --> 01:40:33.742
And no kicking either!

01:40:35.494 --> 01:40:37.704
Get them up! Make them fight fair!

01:40:37.788 --> 01:40:39.373
Now you fight fair, Martin!

01:40:39.456 --> 01:40:40.916
Wait a minute!

01:40:41.667 --> 01:40:43.127
Somebody's fiddle.

01:40:46.964 --> 01:40:49.049
No choking! No gouging!

01:40:51.468 --> 01:40:53.137
Mr. Edwards, make 'em stop!

01:40:53.220 --> 01:40:54.805
Why? You started it.

01:40:55.514 --> 01:40:57.391
Marty, watch his feet!

01:41:00.936 --> 01:41:02.813
Don't forget, you're a lady.

01:41:20.247 --> 01:41:21.790
Come on, Charlie. Get up!

01:41:21.915 --> 01:41:23.584
Are you all right?

01:41:23.876 --> 01:41:25.127
I reckon so.

01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:30.466
Now, come on. I want you boys
to shake hands and make friends.

01:41:31.717 --> 01:41:34.011
Sorry I bit your ear, Marty.

01:41:36.096 --> 01:41:37.973
It don't hurt none, Charlie.

01:41:38.474 --> 01:41:42.019
Now you boys get cleaned up
and we'll proceed with the wedding.

01:41:42.644 --> 01:41:43.270
Where's my Bible?

01:41:43.395 --> 01:41:45.689
There ain't gonna be no wedding.

01:41:53.697 --> 01:41:57.159
Not till we get a few things
cleared up around here.

01:42:03.832 --> 01:42:07.377
It was a nice wedding party,
considering nobody got married.

01:42:11.131 --> 01:42:13.717
Ethan, I gotta ask you and Martin
to take a ride with me...

01:42:13.842 --> 01:42:15.719
down to the state capital.

01:42:16.553 --> 01:42:19.264
Is this an invite
to a necktie party, Reverend?

01:42:19.973 --> 01:42:21.975
No, I wouldn't say that.

01:42:22.810 --> 01:42:25.729
Likely you had your reasons
for killin' Futterman.

01:42:26.563 --> 01:42:28.315
Probably needed killin'.

01:42:28.941 --> 01:42:32.402
I'm talking to you now as a ranger,
not as a preacher.

01:42:33.654 --> 01:42:36.573
The fact that all three of 'em
was shot in the back was...

01:42:36.657 --> 01:42:39.284
the only thing
that raised some questions.

01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:41.370
That, and...

01:42:41.995 --> 01:42:45.415
a missin' gold piece that was
known to have been on him...

01:42:46.375 --> 01:42:48.460
just prior to his demise.

01:42:50.420 --> 01:42:53.132
Ethan, I'll have to ask you for your gun.

01:43:06.270 --> 01:43:08.981
Well, if it's all the
same to you, Reverend...

01:43:09.731 --> 01:43:11.191
I ain't goin' to Austin!

01:43:11.226 --> 01:43:13.485
You're goin' if the captain says so.

01:43:14.111 --> 01:43:15.362
Stop it! Stop it!

01:43:15.445 --> 01:43:18.699
I'll put both of you boys
in the smokehouse to cool off.

01:43:21.618 --> 01:43:23.996
Good evening, ma'am. Captain Clayton?

01:43:25.581 --> 01:43:26.915
Excuse me, ma'am.

01:43:28.167 --> 01:43:30.377
- Captain Clayton, sir?
- No.

01:43:32.129 --> 01:43:33.797
I'm Captain Clayton.

01:43:34.006 --> 01:43:36.925
- You're Captain Clayton?
- Yes, I'm Captain Clayton.

01:43:37.050 --> 01:43:39.636
Col. Greenhill's compliments, sir.
The colonel wants to know...

01:43:39.761 --> 01:43:41.847
- Is your head cold?
- No, sir.

01:43:43.098 --> 01:43:44.558
I'm sorry, sir.

01:43:45.184 --> 01:43:49.146
- All right, start at the beginning.
- Col. Greenhill's compliments, sir.

01:43:49.354 --> 01:43:52.065
Hold on, son. Who is this Col. Greenhill
you're talking about?

01:43:52.149 --> 01:43:54.151
Why, Col. Greenhill is Col. Greenhill, sir.

01:43:54.234 --> 01:43:56.234
- Commanding officer of the 15th...
- And who are you?

01:43:56.236 --> 01:43:57.905
I'm Lt. Greenhill, sir.

01:43:57.988 --> 01:44:00.199
What is it your pa wants to know?

01:44:01.033 --> 01:44:02.284
Well, go ahead.

01:44:02.993 --> 01:44:05.153
My pa wants to know....
Col. Greenhill wants to know...

01:44:05.204 --> 01:44:08.415
- how soon you can put a company...
- Turn around, sonny.

01:44:09.583 --> 01:44:11.877
Yeah, he's a Yankee cavalryman.

01:44:12.711 --> 01:44:16.673
Col. Greenhill wants to know how soon
you could.... I resent that, sir!

01:44:16.757 --> 01:44:18.842
Just funnin', son, just funnin'.

01:44:19.593 --> 01:44:22.179
How soon you could put a company
of your men in the field...

01:44:22.304 --> 01:44:24.389
fully armed for joint-punitive action
against the Comanches?

01:44:24.424 --> 01:44:26.767
- Joint what?
- Joint-punitive action.

01:44:27.309 --> 01:44:31.146
We received information about a band
of Comanches under a chief named Scar.

01:44:31.271 --> 01:44:32.606
What information?

01:44:33.023 --> 01:44:34.900
That maybe he's not far from here,
holed up somewhere.

01:44:35.025 --> 01:44:36.777
What makes you think
he's not far from here?

01:44:36.902 --> 01:44:38.779
One of our patrollers picked up a man...

01:44:38.814 --> 01:44:41.156
claims he was a prisoner with Scar
till two days ago.

01:44:41.281 --> 01:44:43.575
Talks kind of crazy,
but we brought him along.

01:44:43.610 --> 01:44:46.703
Says he lives here.
Keeps mentioning a rocking chair.

01:44:52.751 --> 01:44:54.002
Take his arms.

01:44:57.422 --> 01:44:58.590
It's Mose!

01:44:59.216 --> 01:45:02.553
Good evening, ma'am.
I came for my rocking chair.

01:45:03.053 --> 01:45:05.264
- Bring him to the fire.
- Watch him!

01:45:07.349 --> 01:45:08.475
Get him up!

01:45:09.518 --> 01:45:11.520
Here, get him a chair.

01:45:12.354 --> 01:45:14.106
Bring him a drink!

01:45:15.274 --> 01:45:16.608
Watch his head!

01:45:18.610 --> 01:45:21.196
- Take a drink, Mose.
- Drink that down, Mose.

01:45:25.492 --> 01:45:27.578
Mose. Scar... where is he?

01:45:28.620 --> 01:45:32.040
My rocking chair.
You promised me my rocking chair.

01:45:33.208 --> 01:45:36.128
Ask him about Debbie.
Is Debbie all right, Mose?

01:45:38.005 --> 01:45:39.756
Made out I was crazy.

01:45:43.635 --> 01:45:46.138
You don't think I'm crazy, do you, ma'am?

01:45:46.173 --> 01:45:48.515
No, Mose, you're just sick and hurt.

01:45:48.724 --> 01:45:49.892
Thank you, ma'am.

01:45:49.975 --> 01:45:53.020
Mose, try and remember.
You were at Scar's camp.

01:45:53.520 --> 01:45:56.565
I ate dirt and chewed grass. I fooled them.

01:45:56.773 --> 01:45:58.442
Where is Scar holed up?

01:45:58.942 --> 01:46:00.319
I won't tell you.

01:46:02.404 --> 01:46:04.072
I'll tell Marty.

01:46:04.490 --> 01:46:06.366
Seven Fingers, Marty.

01:46:08.243 --> 01:46:10.746
That's enough, Ethan.
Let's get him to bed.

01:46:10.829 --> 01:46:13.457
- Seven Fingers?
- Beg to report, sir...

01:46:13.874 --> 01:46:17.503
that's what he told us,
but there's no such place on the maps.

01:46:19.505 --> 01:46:23.675
Isn't it the Caddo name for where
all them canyons join under the Malapai?

01:46:24.176 --> 01:46:26.178
Seven Fingers of Brazos!

01:46:29.181 --> 01:46:30.349
My rocking chair?

01:46:30.432 --> 01:46:31.683
We'll bring it.

01:46:33.769 --> 01:46:36.188
You go tell your pa that
a company of rangers...

01:46:36.223 --> 01:46:38.482
all 14 of 'em, fully
armed and equipped...

01:46:38.517 --> 01:46:40.234
will be in the field by daylight.

01:46:40.359 --> 01:46:42.736
We'll be headin' for the south end
of the Malapai.

01:46:42.861 --> 01:46:45.572
If he can catch up with us,
all well and good!

01:46:46.198 --> 01:46:49.952
We can't take the field tomorrow.
For your own protection.

01:46:50.994 --> 01:46:53.789
Sonny. Out yonder is a pack
of murderers...

01:46:54.123 --> 01:46:57.251
complete with Texican scalps
and a white-girl captive!

01:46:57.334 --> 01:47:00.254
If you want to protect us,
just keep out of our way.

01:47:00.379 --> 01:47:02.548
Now you skedaddle back to your pa!

01:47:03.507 --> 01:47:07.261
You and Martin are hereby appointed
civilian scouts. Without pay.

01:47:07.469 --> 01:47:11.223
Take the boys and get back
to headquarters and pick up my company.

01:47:21.441 --> 01:47:23.610
You're not going! Not this time.

01:47:24.778 --> 01:47:26.029
Are you crazy?

01:47:26.446 --> 01:47:29.241
It's too late. She is a woman grown now.

01:47:29.992 --> 01:47:32.578
I gotta go, Laurie. I gotta fetch her home.

01:47:32.703 --> 01:47:34.037
Fetch what?

01:47:34.371 --> 01:47:38.208
The leavings of Comanche bucks sold time
and again to the highest bidder with...

01:47:38.333 --> 01:47:39.668
Laurie, shut your mouth!

01:47:39.793 --> 01:47:42.379
Do you know what Ethan
will do if he has a chance?

01:47:42.504 --> 01:47:44.590
He'll put a bullet in her brain!

01:47:45.215 --> 01:47:47.509
I tell you, Martha would want him to!

01:47:48.010 --> 01:47:49.470
Only if I'm dead!

01:48:38.185 --> 01:48:40.687
We can get within 200 yards of them.

01:48:41.313 --> 01:48:43.690
There's a hub back off to the left.

01:48:44.858 --> 01:48:46.401
How many, you figure?

01:48:47.152 --> 01:48:49.029
About a dozen each.

01:48:49.655 --> 01:48:51.114
Enough to go around.

01:49:00.082 --> 01:49:01.834
Well, we found 'em!

01:49:03.710 --> 01:49:04.878
Now, men...

01:49:05.170 --> 01:49:09.258
the state of Texas is paying you
12 Yankee dollars a month.

01:49:10.801 --> 01:49:12.803
Now is your chance to earn it!

01:49:13.095 --> 01:49:16.557
Tighten up your cinches.
We'll go chargin' in about sunup.

01:49:17.182 --> 01:49:19.977
- Now make sure that...
- Just a minute, Reverend!

01:49:25.941 --> 01:49:28.735
If we go charging in, they'll kill her!
And you know it.

01:49:28.861 --> 01:49:31.572
- That's what I'm countin' on.
- I know you are.

01:49:31.989 --> 01:49:34.869
Well, it ain't gonna be that way!
She's alive and she's gonna stay alive!

01:49:34.908 --> 01:49:36.577
Living with Comanches ain't bein' alive.

01:49:36.660 --> 01:49:39.913
It's better she's alive and livin' with
Comanches than her brains bashed out!

01:49:39.948 --> 01:49:42.833
Now, son, I know
this is a bitter thing to say...

01:49:42.916 --> 01:49:45.419
but there's more at stake here
than your sister.

01:49:45.544 --> 01:49:48.255
There sure is.
I'm gonna tell you somethin'.

01:49:48.964 --> 01:49:52.301
I didn't mean to speak of it,
but I'm gonna tell you now.

01:49:52.634 --> 01:49:56.388
You remember that scalp strung
on Scar's lance? Long and wavy?

01:49:56.805 --> 01:50:00.017
Yeah, I saw it. And don't try to tell me
it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's!

01:50:00.142 --> 01:50:01.810
It was your mother's.

01:50:06.273 --> 01:50:09.526
That don't change it.
That don't change nothing!

01:50:13.071 --> 01:50:16.492
Give me a chance to sneak in and
get her out, before you come chargin' in.

01:50:16.617 --> 01:50:17.659
What if you get caught?

01:50:17.743 --> 01:50:21.079
- That don't tell them nothin', does it?
- I said no!

01:50:22.122 --> 01:50:26.835
You go right ahead, son. But at the first
sign of an alarm, we're comin' in.

01:50:28.504 --> 01:50:32.466
We ain't gonna have no time to pick
and choose our targets when we do!

01:50:35.177 --> 01:50:36.637
It's your funeral.

01:51:43.036 --> 01:51:44.413
Captain Clayton!

01:51:46.081 --> 01:51:47.416
Captain Clayton!

01:51:47.833 --> 01:51:49.418
What the Sam Hill...?

01:51:54.840 --> 01:51:58.802
Go ahead! Why don't you have
your bugler blow the charge too?

01:52:00.554 --> 01:52:03.599
Oh, never mind.
Does your pa know you're out here?

01:52:03.807 --> 01:52:06.310
Yes, sir. The troops are 10 miles back.

01:52:06.518 --> 01:52:08.270
The colonel sent me to find you.

01:52:08.395 --> 01:52:11.106
You found me. Good work and goodbye.

01:52:11.523 --> 01:52:13.192
Is there anything I can do, sir?

01:52:13.275 --> 01:52:14.443
God forbid.

01:52:14.526 --> 01:52:18.614
You just go back and tell your pa
where we are and where he is.

01:52:19.114 --> 01:52:21.742
But he knows that, sir. Can't I stay?

01:52:22.993 --> 01:52:24.036
Please?

01:52:25.078 --> 01:52:27.873
Oh, all right. But you watch me, boy.

01:52:28.207 --> 01:52:32.252
I'm the hard case you're up against
out here, not them childish savages.

01:52:32.461 --> 01:52:34.880
If you don't hear my first holler...

01:52:35.088 --> 01:52:36.548
you better read my mind...

01:52:36.583 --> 01:52:40.385
'cause I don't aim to raise no
two hollers on any subject at hand!

01:52:40.511 --> 01:52:42.179
- Yes, sir.
- Boy...

01:52:43.096 --> 01:52:44.681
watch that knife!

01:52:44.890 --> 01:52:46.016
Sorry, sir.

01:53:06.161 --> 01:53:07.204
Halt!

01:53:09.081 --> 01:53:10.124
Mount!

01:53:15.003 --> 01:53:16.255
Mount!

01:53:51.415 --> 01:53:52.666
Don't say anything!

01:53:52.749 --> 01:53:54.418
It's your brother Marty!

01:53:54.626 --> 01:53:58.297
I'm gonna take you away.
I'm gonna get you out of here, Debbie.

01:53:59.131 --> 01:54:00.382
Yes, Marty!

01:54:09.016 --> 01:54:11.226
Brethren, let us go amongst them!

01:54:51.350 --> 01:54:53.852
Charlie, Nesby, run off that pony herd...

01:54:54.603 --> 01:54:56.688
Boy, you watch out for that knife!

01:54:56.772 --> 01:54:58.148
Let's go!

01:55:32.641 --> 01:55:33.809
No, Ethan!

01:55:59.042 --> 01:56:00.169
No, Ethan!

01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:15.309
Let's go home, Debbie.

01:56:24.693 --> 01:56:26.862
- Does that hurt, Reverend?
- Shut up!

01:56:41.877 --> 01:56:44.087
Good work, Captain! Good work, Son.

01:56:44.922 --> 01:56:46.381
You wounded?

01:56:47.216 --> 01:56:49.301
- A bullet? An arrow?
- No!
