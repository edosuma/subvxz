00:33.200 --> 00:35.734
It's been
a lot of fun, ginger.

00:35.736 --> 00:37.836
We've had some
good times, right?

00:37.838 --> 00:39.071
I know I have,

00:39.073 --> 00:41.673
and I think
you feel the same way.

00:41.675 --> 00:43.742
[Mimicking ginger]
Oh, my God.

00:43.744 --> 00:46.445
Don't say what I think
you're gonna say.

00:46.447 --> 00:48.147
[As himself]
Ginger...

00:48.149 --> 00:50.082
We had a good run.

00:50.084 --> 00:51.350
The sex...

00:51.352 --> 00:53.952
The pointless conversations
before sex,

00:53.954 --> 00:55.020
all of it.

00:55.022 --> 00:56.522
But let's face it,

00:56.524 --> 00:59.224
we have nothing in common.

00:59.226 --> 01:02.694
[As ginger]
Don't, Dylan. Please.

01:02.696 --> 01:03.729
You mean everything to me.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.330

Shh, t-t-t-b-b-b-bye, ginger.

01:09.470 --> 01:10.803
It's over.

01:10.805 --> 01:12.071
Now, you're a good kid.

01:12.073 --> 01:14.039
I know you're gonna
land on your feet.

01:21.182 --> 01:22.748
No good.

01:24.251 --> 01:27.920
It's not you, ginger,
it's me. I come from a--

01:27.922 --> 01:28.620
Dylan?

01:28.622 --> 01:31.090
What are you doing here?

01:31.092 --> 01:32.792
You don't smoke.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.493
Yeah, I know.
I'm trying to start.

01:34.495 --> 01:35.928
Ginger, I think
we should talk.

01:35.930 --> 01:37.729
I gotta get ready
for work.

01:37.731 --> 01:39.364
Fine.

01:39.366 --> 01:40.899
Ginger, we've had
some good times.

01:40.901 --> 01:42.000
Dylan, before you go
any further,

01:42.002 --> 01:44.403
there's something
I've been wanting to say.

01:44.405 --> 01:46.905
I don't think I'm the girl
you're looking for.

01:46.907 --> 01:47.840
Oh, my God, don't say

01:47.842 --> 01:49.141
what I think
you're gonna say.

01:49.143 --> 01:52.010
You keep trying
to change me.

01:52.012 --> 01:52.911
No, I don't.

01:52.913 --> 01:54.780
Yes, you do.
You can't accept the fact

01:54.782 --> 01:58.217
that I don't like
<i> caddyshack</i> or ac/dc.

01:58.219 --> 02:00.085
Well, you never listened
to their first album.

02:00.087 --> 02:02.154
And what's with the
community college crap?

02:02.156 --> 02:03.789
Are you telling me it
wasn't you who put these

02:03.791 --> 02:07.025
under the sink next
to the tampax?

02:07.027 --> 02:09.193
Nice touch.

02:09.196 --> 02:10.929
Don't you get it?

02:10.931 --> 02:14.199
I already have a career.

Come on.

Look, Dylan...

02:16.937 --> 02:18.537
We have nothing in common.

02:18.539 --> 02:19.304
What about the sex?

02:19.306 --> 02:20.405
Oh, Dylan,
sex isn't everything.

02:20.407 --> 02:22.407
And you said that yourself
just the other night.

02:22.409 --> 02:25.077
Well, that was right
after we had sex.

02:25.079 --> 02:26.512

Well, when you put it
that way,

I don't know why we went
out in the first place.

02:46.367 --> 02:49.134

it was really slow here

06:07.968 --> 06:09.534
and I was sitting down
watching Sally Jesse

06:09.536 --> 06:11.603
and you shot me with
a rubber band to my arm

stop itching your butt

06:13.874 --> 06:14.773

absolutely right.

my horizons.

like turtle,

I'll kill myself.

no time to waste.

like you, boss.

heads off the chickens,

I want to be there.

the melons,

06:35.929 --> 06:37.429
when you're hitting
on the customers,

06:37.431 --> 06:38.797
I want to be right there
with you, boss.

06:38.799 --> 06:41.133
You know, chopping,
squeezing, hitting,

06:41.135 --> 06:43.301
you know? I mean, I want
to just follow you

feels good.

and that's flattering.

It's good to hear
that stuff.

moving in with me.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.784
No. Big no.

06:58.786 --> 07:01.086
But I think turtle
might have bunk beds,

figure something out...

the last burn on her.

07:35.322 --> 07:36.421
No. But I should've.

07:36.423 --> 07:38.190

thought of it right now

07:38.192 --> 07:39.291

know what to do.

19:45.418 --> 19:47.885
She's worldly,
sophisticated, French.

19:47.887 --> 19:49.520
I'm gonna have to
come up with something

19:49.522 --> 19:51.322
a little more inventive.

19:51.324 --> 19:53.524
[Knocking on door]

19:54.227 --> 19:56.527
Dominos.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.563
Yes?

19:59.666 --> 20:02.466
Is this the squankmeyer
residence?

20:02.468 --> 20:04.802
Squankmeyer? No.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.637
[Chuckles] I'll tell you,

20:06.639 --> 20:09.140
these complexes
are so complex.

20:09.142 --> 20:10.441
I get all twisted around.

20:10.443 --> 20:12.710
Sorry. Good night.

20:15.381 --> 20:16.480
Who was it?

20:16.482 --> 20:18.449
Nobody.

20:28.428 --> 20:29.727
Mercedes, huh?

20:29.729 --> 20:31.362
So was it one of
those little, uh,

20:31.364 --> 20:33.030
280 sls or the...

20:33.032 --> 20:34.966
Big kick-ass
500 series?

20:34.968 --> 20:37.668
Uh, I think it was
the "I've got the girl

20:37.670 --> 20:38.970
"and you're whacking it
in the bushes

20:38.972 --> 20:40.771
with a cold pizza" series.

20:40.773 --> 20:42.907
I can't stop thinking
about this girl.

20:42.909 --> 20:46.010
Oh, Dylan, stop
torturing yourself.

20:46.012 --> 20:48.246
I mean, look, you know
how this is gonna turn out.

20:48.248 --> 20:50.448
It won't be any different
than it was

20:50.449 --> 20:52.649
with your little rodeo rider
from the saddle sore saloon.

20:52.652 --> 20:54.919
You'll go out,
you'll become infatuated,

20:54.921 --> 20:57.822
then in 6 weeks, if she
hasn't already left you,

20:57.824 --> 20:58.856
you'll find some reason
to dump her.

20:58.858 --> 21:01.392
I mean, either way,
you're gonna end up alone.

21:01.394 --> 21:03.094
Again.

21:03.096 --> 21:04.028
Thanks for the pep talk.

21:04.030 --> 21:05.830
Why don't you go coach
the clippers?

21:05.832 --> 21:07.431
[Baby cries]

21:07.433 --> 21:09.400
I'll get her.

21:14.307 --> 21:15.906
Hey, do me a favor.

21:15.908 --> 21:18.009
Hold onto this for me.

21:18.011 --> 21:19.878
What is it?

21:19.879 --> 21:21.746
It's Gail's anniversary
gift. Check it out.

21:21.748 --> 21:23.247
Oh.

21:23.249 --> 21:24.181
Yeah.

21:24.183 --> 21:25.016
It's nice.

21:25.018 --> 21:26.017
Yeah. It's a surprise,

21:26.019 --> 21:26.784
so just hold it for me.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.986
No, I shouldn't
hold onto that.

21:28.988 --> 21:30.054
Well, I can't
keep it here.

21:30.055 --> 21:31.121
I don't want her to
find it. Just keep it,

21:31.124 --> 21:32.390
and I'll tell you
when I need it back.

21:32.392 --> 21:33.224
I'm not the guy for that.

21:33.226 --> 21:34.625
No, I'm gonna get it
back from you.

21:34.627 --> 21:35.559
I don't want it.
Why not?

21:35.561 --> 21:36.761
I don't need things
like this in my life.

21:36.763 --> 21:38.729
I'm asking for
one stinking favor.

21:38.731 --> 21:40.197
Just take it.
Coming back.

21:40.199 --> 21:43.401
Hey, look who's here,
sweetie.

21:43.403 --> 21:45.803
It's Uncle Dylan.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.104
Yes.

21:47.106 --> 21:48.139
Do you want to?

21:48.141 --> 21:50.608
Sure.
Here you go.

21:52.679 --> 21:55.497
There you go.

21:55.498 --> 21:58.316
All right, you little punk,
I got you...In my grips.

21:58.318 --> 21:59.417
You like that?

21:59.419 --> 22:01.102
All right,
you get a little,

22:01.103 --> 22:02.786
but if you garp any back
on me, I do it to you.

22:02.789 --> 22:05.589
Ok, look, here's
the bottom line.

22:05.591 --> 22:06.624
When I first met you,

22:06.626 --> 22:08.392
I thought you were
kind of a jerk.

22:08.394 --> 22:10.628
Your mommy's kind of
a bitch sometimes.

22:10.630 --> 22:11.762
Until I got to know you.

22:11.764 --> 22:14.098
And then I could see
how really sweet you are--

22:14.100 --> 22:15.599
a-a-at least
intermittently.

22:15.601 --> 22:16.701
I mean, what
I'm trying to say

22:16.703 --> 22:18.202
is that if you really
like this girl,

22:18.204 --> 22:20.137
she has to get to know you.

22:20.139 --> 22:21.138
Gail's right.

22:21.140 --> 22:22.273
Hey, you're
a closer, man.

22:22.275 --> 22:24.709
All you need
is some quality time

22:24.711 --> 22:26.043
with this girl.

22:26.045 --> 22:27.912
[Whispers]
Quality time...

22:27.914 --> 22:29.847
Come on, lila,
I'm really sorry.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.682
I really thought he was
going to be there.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.317
He was not. He was not.
What can I do?

22:33.319 --> 22:35.519
But I promise,
tomorrow I call Max

22:35.521 --> 22:37.188
and I arrange
for you to meet.

22:37.190 --> 22:38.556

of here. I'll find him.

let you do that.

for a dog today, anyway.

to sleep with my instrument.

my whole life.

All I've done since
I was 5 years old is...

28:26.372 --> 28:28.372
Play music.

28:29.375 --> 28:31.975
Jeez, the only focus
I had when I was 5

28:31.977 --> 28:33.210
was not to wet

28:33.212 --> 28:36.413
I used to sprinkle cereal
on my sheets at night,

28:36.415 --> 28:38.716
and then when I'd hear
"snap, crackle, pop,"

28:38.718 --> 28:40.684
I'd wake up and run
to the bathroom.

28:40.686 --> 28:43.020
Of course, I had
to kill those guys.

28:43.022 --> 28:44.221
They knew too much.

28:44.223 --> 28:46.540
Snap and crackle
were cool,

28:46.541 --> 28:48.858
but pop had a little bit
of a tooth problem.

28:48.861 --> 28:49.893
[Chuckles]

28:49.895 --> 28:51.662
[Laughs]

28:51.664 --> 28:54.231
She smiled. Finally.

28:54.934 --> 28:56.533
[Sighs]

28:57.603 --> 28:59.303
Ooh, a playground.

28:59.305 --> 29:01.105
Let's play.

29:02.475 --> 29:04.141
Dylan, what are you doing?

29:04.143 --> 29:07.144
Shh, shh, shh!
You'll spook him.

29:08.581 --> 29:10.114
Settle in.

29:10.116 --> 29:12.015
Ok, what you got,
horsy?

29:12.017 --> 29:14.451
What you got?
That ain't much.

29:14.453 --> 29:16.153
Hee hee hee! Ooh!

29:16.155 --> 29:17.638
Yeah!

29:17.639 --> 29:19.122
Is that it? I saw
your mommy at kmart.

29:19.125 --> 29:21.258
You can ride <i> her</i>
for a quarter.

29:21.260 --> 29:22.793
That's what I said.

29:22.795 --> 29:24.194
Ohh!
Oh!

29:24.196 --> 29:28.232
Are you--oops!
Are you ok? Sorry.

29:28.234 --> 29:30.200
Was that 8 seconds?

29:30.202 --> 29:32.236
Oh, my God.

29:32.238 --> 29:33.604
[Chuckles]

29:33.606 --> 29:35.038
You almost
made me forget

29:35.040 --> 29:37.274
how terrible this week
has been for me.

29:37.276 --> 29:38.709
Oh, it can't
be that bad.

29:38.711 --> 29:40.043
Ha! And on top
of everything,

29:40.045 --> 29:44.014
my former fiancé just
showed up out of nowhere.

29:44.016 --> 29:45.315
He expects me to forget

29:45.317 --> 29:46.683
everything that happened
between us

29:46.685 --> 29:48.051
and fly back
to Paris with him.

29:48.053 --> 29:49.486
Can you believe it?

29:49.488 --> 29:51.138
That bastard.

29:51.139 --> 29:52.789
And just because he's gorgeous
and talented and charming

29:52.792 --> 29:54.792
and rich
and famous and...

29:54.794 --> 29:58.045
I get it.
Keep goin'.

29:58.046 --> 30:01.297
He thinks I'm just going to
forget about how he treated me.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.783
Unhh!

30:02.784 --> 30:04.267
The things I hated
the most were his lies.

30:04.270 --> 30:08.172
Without honesty,
you have nothing. You agree?

30:08.641 --> 30:10.491
Yeah.

30:10.492 --> 30:12.342
Uh, honesty is
very important.

30:13.078 --> 30:14.995
Ice cream!

30:14.996 --> 30:16.913
Now, that's...
<i> Really</i> important.

30:17.416 --> 30:19.149
All right.
I tell you what.

30:19.151 --> 30:20.684
You've had
a long day.

30:20.686 --> 30:22.486
Uh...Why don't you
go inside,

30:22.488 --> 30:25.022
take a bath, relax,
light some candles.

30:25.024 --> 30:27.324
I'll get out there
and do a final pass

30:27.326 --> 30:28.759
of the neighborhood. Ok?

30:28.761 --> 30:29.993
You would do that?

30:29.995 --> 30:31.495
Sure. Yeah, no problem.

30:31.497 --> 30:33.197
And I'll see you later.

30:33.199 --> 30:35.666
I mean, if I find him.

30:36.802 --> 30:37.801
Dylan?

30:37.803 --> 30:40.054
Yeah.

30:40.055 --> 30:42.306
I'm very lucky to have
a neighbor like you.

30:47.146 --> 30:48.679
Yeah.

30:55.020 --> 30:56.720
[Door closes]

31:01.560 --> 31:03.594
Oop. God.

31:08.300 --> 31:09.266
Ooh, burn on me.

31:09.268 --> 31:10.901
You got out
of the bathroom door.

31:10.903 --> 31:13.136
You want to call
letterman, or should I?

31:13.138 --> 31:16.173
[Imitating letterman]
This dog has a gift.

31:16.175 --> 31:17.808
[Autodialing]

31:17.810 --> 31:18.842
[Ring]

31:18.844 --> 31:19.943
Hey. Wally, it's Dylan.

31:19.945 --> 31:23.280
Yeah. Can you get
lasagna and salad for two

31:23.282 --> 31:24.848
delivered to my house stat?

31:24.850 --> 31:27.317
And make it nice.
Thanks, pal.

31:27.319 --> 31:29.052
You don't need
my credit card.

31:29.054 --> 31:30.687
I own the place.
Remember?

31:30.689 --> 31:33.323
All right.
You're doin' good.

31:34.426 --> 31:35.425
Well, well, well.

31:35.427 --> 31:37.261
It's time to take you
home, buddy,

31:37.263 --> 31:39.296
and earn
my hero stripes.

31:39.298 --> 31:41.365
Yeah!

31:42.501 --> 31:44.101
[Whimpers]

31:45.537 --> 31:47.170
You did not.

31:47.172 --> 31:48.939
Where's the ring, Jack?

31:48.941 --> 31:50.274
I need to have it.

31:50.276 --> 31:52.042
Look at me,
you little tarantula.

31:52.044 --> 31:53.710
I know you know
where it is.

31:53.712 --> 31:56.079
Do the right thing,
and point your snout at it.

31:56.081 --> 31:57.915
Talk to me.
[Knock knock]

31:57.917 --> 32:00.584
Who is it?
Wally.

32:02.655 --> 32:05.923
Oh...My...God.

32:05.925 --> 32:07.341
Oh, no.

32:07.342 --> 32:08.758
It's <i> single</i>
<i> white female.</i>

32:08.761 --> 32:10.994
So, let me get
this right, boss.

32:10.996 --> 32:12.095
You lost mark's ring,

32:12.097 --> 32:14.197
and then you stole
some broad's dog

32:14.199 --> 32:15.832
to help you
find the ring,

32:15.834 --> 32:17.501
and then the dog
lost the...

32:17.503 --> 32:19.536
Oh, wait.
Let me start over.

32:19.538 --> 32:21.138
Just look.

32:25.844 --> 32:28.712
You want some flowers
for that vase?

32:28.714 --> 32:30.213
Huh?

32:30.649 --> 32:32.582
Hey. Don't give him
any of that.

32:32.584 --> 32:36.486
He doesn't get anything
till we get the ring back.

32:37.923 --> 32:41.458
Heh heh. This dog'll
eat anything.

32:43.762 --> 32:47.030
Hey, there's
my mail key.

32:47.032 --> 32:48.131
[Grrr]

32:48.133 --> 32:49.466
It's difficult to tell.

32:49.468 --> 32:51.368
This could be
the ring right here.

32:51.370 --> 32:53.837
And you know
what that means.

32:53.839 --> 32:55.906
Sure. Cut him open, doc.

32:55.908 --> 32:57.341
I'll grab his paws.

32:57.343 --> 32:58.909
That's a little drastic.

32:58.911 --> 33:00.577
If it's in there,
all you have to do

33:00.579 --> 33:03.513
is wait for it to pass
through his system...

33:03.515 --> 33:04.614
And then retrieve it.

33:04.616 --> 33:06.249
I think you're
the only one psyched-up

33:06.251 --> 33:09.319
for <i> that</i> treasure hunt,
doc.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.722
Oh, you won this round,
my friend,

33:11.724 --> 33:15.092
but this is
far from over.

33:15.094 --> 33:17.427
What are you sniffin'
around for? It's all good grass.

33:17.429 --> 33:21.231
Just do it.
I don't have all day.

33:23.569 --> 33:24.868
Hey, I got an idea.

33:24.870 --> 33:29.039
This worked on me once
in summer camp.

33:34.146 --> 33:35.979
Oh...

33:35.981 --> 33:37.180
Yeah.

33:37.182 --> 33:38.515
Ooh!

33:38.517 --> 33:40.283
Doesn't that feel good?

33:40.285 --> 33:42.019
Nice warm water.

33:42.021 --> 33:43.920
Loosens everything up.

33:43.922 --> 33:46.123
It's so relaxing.

33:46.125 --> 33:47.958
Yeah.

33:49.795 --> 33:52.062
Great. Now <i> I</i> gotta go.

33:52.064 --> 33:53.663
All right.

33:55.734 --> 33:57.801
Put you right here.

33:57.803 --> 33:59.903
Stay.

33:59.904 --> 34:02.004
I'll be real quick.
Just number one.

Jack, wait!

34:25.431 --> 34:26.996
Come on.

34:30.835 --> 34:31.668
Uhh.

34:31.670 --> 34:33.904
How we doin'?

34:35.274 --> 34:36.206
[Sighs]

34:36.208 --> 34:38.308
Sorry, boss. No ring.

34:38.310 --> 34:40.677
Well, thanks for
comin' over, man.

34:40.679 --> 34:44.581
I value this time
we spend together, boss.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.248
Did I get any on me?

34:46.251 --> 34:50.087
Mmm...A little
right here.

34:51.623 --> 34:53.889
You got it.

34:55.561 --> 34:57.294
Clean up.

34:58.263 --> 34:59.863
Sure thing, boss.

34:59.865 --> 35:01.164
[Jack panting]

35:01.166 --> 35:05.168
Oh, my gosh. The only thing
worse than doggy breath

35:05.170 --> 35:07.003
is doggy morning breath.

35:07.005 --> 35:08.772
Go!

35:09.041 --> 35:13.743
Wait. If you're up here,
then what's poking in...

35:13.745 --> 35:16.379
Yoo hoo hoo! My God!

35:17.416 --> 35:18.515
What?!

35:18.516 --> 35:19.615
What are you doin'
in my bed?

35:19.618 --> 35:23.120
It was cold
on the couch, and...

35:23.122 --> 35:24.287
Besides, I heard a noise.

35:24.289 --> 35:27.958
You just snuggled up on me
like some sort of pea pod.

35:27.960 --> 35:29.226
[Chuckling]
Yeah.

35:29.228 --> 35:30.460
Get out.

35:30.462 --> 35:31.528
Wait.

35:31.529 --> 35:32.595
Where'd you get
those underpants?

35:32.598 --> 35:36.032
Oh, outta the hamper.
I had to dig a little.

35:36.034 --> 35:38.368
Oh, my God!
That's disgusting!

35:38.370 --> 35:39.569
Take 'em off!

35:39.571 --> 35:43.206
No, don't. Wait.
Just...Get out.

have any luck last night.

36:30.055 --> 36:31.621
I mean...With Jack.

36:31.623 --> 36:35.258
Uh, so I made,
uh, posters.

36:35.260 --> 36:37.661
And do you have something
to hang them with?

36:37.663 --> 36:40.931
Yeah. Sure, I do. Wait here.
I'll go with you.

36:40.933 --> 36:41.598
No.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.667
No, no. It's no problem.

36:43.668 --> 36:45.735
No, I'll be right back.
Just 2 seconds.

36:46.471 --> 36:47.971
Ok. Let's do it.

36:47.973 --> 36:49.839
I figure we'll start
on bradbury

36:49.841 --> 36:51.508
and work our way north.

36:51.509 --> 36:53.176
There's a little coffee shop
if you want to grab a bite.

36:53.178 --> 36:55.212
I really...Appreciate
your help, but...

36:55.214 --> 36:57.113
Isn't there somewhere
you have to be?

36:57.115 --> 36:59.616
I own the place, baby.
I don't punch a clock.

36:59.618 --> 37:02.252
Besides, you shouldn't
do this by yourself.

and I told him about Jack.

very upset, but...

He offered to help me.

37:10.395 --> 37:12.395
Like that's gonna work?
What a worm.

37:12.397 --> 37:14.364
The guy thinks
he can weasel his way

37:14.366 --> 37:17.767
back into your life
through your dog?

37:20.405 --> 37:22.973
How could I say no?

37:22.975 --> 37:24.608
I'll coach you.

Mm-hmm.

37:47.899 --> 37:50.000

37:53.105 --> 37:54.404
Plenty of vitamins.

Good for your coloring.

37:58.977 --> 38:00.710
How's this?

38:00.711 --> 38:02.444
I think a little incentive
would not hurt.

38:02.447 --> 38:03.847
A reward, perhaps?

38:03.849 --> 38:06.850
No. I cannot.
I don't have enough.

38:06.852 --> 38:08.084
But I do.

38:08.086 --> 38:10.153
Give me the pen.

you know?

38:22.868 --> 38:26.870
Yeah, if you're tryin'
to get a chicken back.

¶ Loo loo ¶

38:29.107 --> 38:30.607

49:24.762 --> 49:27.263
before you throw down
a big Stanley steamer?

49:27.265 --> 49:29.065
How did you get
in here, anyway?

49:29.067 --> 49:31.834
Oh. I had a key made
while you were sleepin'.

49:31.836 --> 49:33.336
I didn't want
to wake you up.

49:33.338 --> 49:35.471
Did you ever work
for Selena?

49:35.473 --> 49:36.572
[Bitingly]
Hello, Jack.

49:36.574 --> 49:38.641
Anything you want
to give me?

49:38.643 --> 49:40.776
[Whining]

49:41.312 --> 49:42.044
Hmm.

49:42.046 --> 49:44.280
Now we play my way.

49:44.282 --> 49:46.615
Wally, load it up.

49:47.151 --> 49:48.985
[Neigh]

49:48.987 --> 49:50.953

49:50.955 --> 49:51.887

[Woof]

50:01.199 --> 50:02.365
[Woof woof]

50:02.367 --> 50:04.033
He's mine.

50:04.035 --> 50:06.168
[Woof woof woof]

50:06.170 --> 50:08.137
Let me do it.

50:08.139 --> 50:09.105

50:27.058 --> 50:28.124
[Gunshot]
[Yip]

50:28.126 --> 50:30.893
See what happened to him?
And he was a good doggy.

50:30.895 --> 50:32.294
Startin' to get it?

50:32.296 --> 50:33.596
[Knock on door]

50:33.598 --> 50:35.798
Did you order pizza?

50:35.800 --> 50:37.266
Mm-mmm.

50:37.268 --> 50:38.768
[Crying]

50:38.770 --> 50:40.269
Who is it?

50:40.271 --> 50:43.472
It's lila. I want
to talk to you.

50:43.474 --> 50:44.373
Uhh.

50:44.375 --> 50:46.942
Chew. Chew. Quiet,
quiet, quiet, quiet.

50:46.944 --> 50:48.344
Lila: Dylan.

50:48.345 --> 50:49.745
Here. Take him
in the bathroom.

50:49.747 --> 50:50.997
Hmm?

50:50.998 --> 50:52.248
Go in the bathroom.
Be quiet.

50:52.250 --> 50:54.417
Hide, hide, hide.

50:54.419 --> 50:55.518
Is everything ok?

50:55.520 --> 50:58.154
Yes! I'm just cleaning up!
It's a mess!

50:58.156 --> 50:59.655
Stay in here
and be super quiet.

50:59.657 --> 51:02.091
But, boss, I can't be quiet.
I got the dog on--

51:02.093 --> 51:03.926
no, no.
No. No. Shh!

51:04.762 --> 51:06.629
Stay. Shh. Quiet.

51:10.601 --> 51:11.400
Hey.

51:11.402 --> 51:13.069
Hey! I know you.

51:13.071 --> 51:15.371
I'm not interrupting
something, am I?

51:15.373 --> 51:18.240
No, no. Don't
be ridiculous.

51:18.242 --> 51:20.076
Is there a girl
in there?

51:20.078 --> 51:22.545
A girl? You're
the only girl I know.

51:22.547 --> 51:24.380
[Chuckling]
Oh.

51:24.382 --> 51:25.715
Well, um...

51:25.716 --> 51:27.049
I just wanted to
come by and say hi.

51:27.051 --> 51:30.052
Just say hi.
Interesting.

51:30.054 --> 51:31.587
No, actually, I, um,

51:31.589 --> 51:33.589
I wanted you to know
that I'm sorry

51:33.591 --> 51:35.157
for being such
a terrible neighbor.

51:35.159 --> 51:38.027
I should not have made
Jack your problem.

51:38.029 --> 51:40.129
Trust me...

51:40.130 --> 51:42.230
I made Jack
my own problem.

51:42.433 --> 51:44.366
Ohhh...
You're so sweet.

51:44.368 --> 51:46.702
I <i> am</i> sweet.
I've heard that.

51:46.704 --> 51:48.170
Anyway,
you said it yourself.

51:48.172 --> 51:51.974
He's run off before.
I'm sure he'll pop up.

51:52.577 --> 51:53.642
Hey! Oh!

51:53.644 --> 51:54.543
Mosquitoes.

51:54.545 --> 51:56.912
Oh, my God, you're
gonna get eaten alive.

51:56.914 --> 51:57.947
Let's get outta here.

51:57.949 --> 52:01.050
I know the perfect spot
to take you.

52:02.420 --> 52:04.887
How long have you
owned it?

52:04.889 --> 52:06.388
3 months.

52:06.390 --> 52:07.456
I like it.

52:07.458 --> 52:09.458
Yeah?

52:09.459 --> 52:11.459
Let me show you
something really cool.

52:18.603 --> 52:22.071
Hey, where I come from,
this would be illegal.

52:22.073 --> 52:23.672
A harmless little b&e?

52:23.674 --> 52:26.642
6 months to a year Max.

52:27.078 --> 52:28.010
Got it.

52:28.012 --> 52:31.030
What is this place?

52:31.031 --> 52:34.049
Well, this is hopefully...
The new wing to my restaurant.

52:34.051 --> 52:37.453
Doesn't look
like much right now...

52:37.822 --> 52:39.355
But use your imagination.

52:39.357 --> 52:42.024
Over here is gonna be
all big windows.

52:42.026 --> 52:45.594
Back there's gonna be
a bar, really cool.

52:45.596 --> 52:49.431
And up front in the corner,
I'm gonna have live music.

52:49.433 --> 52:51.567
It sounds like you can
already see it.

52:51.569 --> 52:54.186
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

52:54.187 --> 52:56.804
Just picture it in your head,
then you make it happen.

52:56.807 --> 52:59.542
Wow. You're so positive.

52:59.544 --> 53:01.243
Nothing gets
in your way.

53:01.245 --> 53:03.846
Well, it's easy.

53:03.847 --> 53:06.448
Isn't there something
you've always wanted to do?

53:06.450 --> 53:07.783
No.

53:07.785 --> 53:10.252
No, I don't.

53:10.655 --> 53:12.855
No? Come on.

53:13.724 --> 53:17.459
Well, um,
it's embarrassing.

53:17.461 --> 53:19.195
Um...

53:20.598 --> 53:22.598
Yeah, I'm...

53:23.034 --> 53:26.001
I'd love to play my cello
on the great stage

53:26.003 --> 53:28.337
in front of thousands
of people, but...

53:28.339 --> 53:33.075
But...You ever imagine
yourself doing it?

53:33.077 --> 53:35.377
Mmm. It would be
pointless.

53:35.379 --> 53:38.881
I'm too afraid to even
have an audition.

53:40.451 --> 53:42.284
Rene used to tell me

53:42.286 --> 53:44.053
that I don't
have it in me.

53:44.055 --> 53:47.122
I think that's why
I really left France,

53:47.124 --> 53:48.224
to prove him wrong.

53:48.226 --> 53:50.359
Well, I don't know.

53:51.662 --> 53:54.263
Well, he is wrong,

53:54.265 --> 53:57.666
and you just haven't
proved it yet.

54:00.071 --> 54:02.404
See, I pictured you
with a smile.

54:02.406 --> 54:05.274
Look what happened.

54:18.155 --> 54:20.856
What are you all
dressed up for?

54:20.858 --> 54:22.291
Road trip.

54:22.293 --> 54:23.759
And what's that for?

54:23.761 --> 54:25.394
You'll see.

54:25.396 --> 54:27.696
Come on.

54:30.801 --> 54:32.568
Ok. Don't mind
that sign.

54:32.570 --> 54:35.904
Back up, back up.
Back up.

54:35.906 --> 54:36.705
Where are we?

54:36.707 --> 54:38.774
I can't ruin the surprise.

54:38.776 --> 54:41.377
Just go straight.

54:44.815 --> 54:45.781
Ok, come on.

54:45.783 --> 54:46.815
Step, step.

54:46.817 --> 54:47.783
Are you sure?

54:47.785 --> 54:49.318
Watch your step.

54:49.320 --> 54:52.221
Watch your step,
I can't watch anything.

54:52.223 --> 54:54.123
You'll be very safe.

54:54.125 --> 54:55.924
Don't take advantage, huh?

54:55.926 --> 54:57.960
I'm not.

54:57.961 --> 54:59.995
It's just a minefield
I wanted to show you.

54:59.997 --> 55:02.765
All right, we're
coming this way.

55:02.767 --> 55:05.801
You're fairly safe.

55:05.803 --> 55:09.705
You're gonna go right
about to here and...

55:09.707 --> 55:11.040
That's it?

55:11.042 --> 55:12.508
I'll be right back.

55:12.510 --> 55:14.043
Stay there.

55:14.045 --> 55:16.679
You're fine,
you're fine.

55:16.681 --> 55:20.082
Ok, and take it off.

55:41.038 --> 55:43.806
I don't believe this.

55:43.808 --> 55:45.324
How...

55:45.325 --> 55:46.841
It's amazing what
a free pizza

55:46.844 --> 55:47.776
will get you.

55:47.778 --> 55:50.079
Now, come on, we don't
have all day.

55:50.081 --> 55:52.448
I don't understand.

55:52.450 --> 55:54.416
Play.

55:54.752 --> 55:58.020
But...But there's
nobody here.

55:58.022 --> 55:58.987
I know. Baby steps.

55:58.989 --> 56:01.590
You gotta crawl
before you can walk.

56:01.592 --> 56:03.392
Use your imagination.

56:03.394 --> 56:06.462
This is silly.

56:06.764 --> 56:08.781
Ladies and gentlemen,

56:08.782 --> 56:10.799
the captain and tennille
will not be seen tonight

56:10.801 --> 56:13.902
so we may bring you
a special presentation

56:13.904 --> 56:15.337
of miss lila Dubois.

56:15.339 --> 56:17.239
[Imitating applause]

56:17.241 --> 56:19.208
Show us your boobs!

56:19.210 --> 56:21.710
And I have to?

56:21.846 --> 56:23.379
No, that's worst-case
scenario.

56:23.381 --> 56:26.248
When people yell it
at me, I just, uh,

56:26.250 --> 56:27.583
I just ignore 'em.

56:27.585 --> 56:29.051
That's very easy to say,

56:29.053 --> 56:31.220
but what about when
it's full?

56:31.222 --> 56:32.855
You gotta remember,

56:32.857 --> 56:34.390
they're all
on your team.

56:34.392 --> 56:36.325
The people that come
to listen--

56:36.327 --> 56:38.293
they're here to escape
screaming kids

56:38.295 --> 56:40.496
and honking horns
and ringing phones.

56:40.498 --> 56:42.231
Any noise that comes
out of that cello

56:42.233 --> 56:44.583
they're gonna love.

56:44.584 --> 56:46.934
And what about the guy
who wants to see my boobs?

56:46.937 --> 56:47.903
Well, that's me,

56:47.905 --> 56:51.740
and I promise I won't
yell during the show.

56:55.246 --> 56:57.079
Now play.

56:58.616 --> 57:00.382
Ok.

57:00.918 --> 57:04.119
There you go.
Get the bow.

57:04.922 --> 57:06.355
All right,
crank it up,

57:06.357 --> 57:09.191
plug it in,
whatever you gotta do.

57:09.193 --> 57:12.327
Pull out the antenna.

57:16.567 --> 57:19.468
All right, axl.

58:52.296 --> 58:56.365
That was so great.

58:56.967 --> 58:58.417
You are good.

58:58.418 --> 58:59.868
Hey, I pictured the house
full of people.

58:59.870 --> 59:01.403
That's right,
standing room only.

59:01.405 --> 59:03.305
Thank you. It felt so good.

59:03.307 --> 59:05.207
No problem.
You were the one--

59:05.209 --> 59:07.242
man: Hey, Dylan!

59:07.244 --> 59:10.612
Thanks for the extra
anchovies.

59:11.115 --> 59:12.981
Ok.

59:13.951 --> 59:15.484
Uh...

59:15.486 --> 59:17.152
All right. Well,
let's get outta here.

59:17.154 --> 59:22.157
I'll carry this.
You carry this.

59:25.396 --> 59:27.429
Is there a handle?

59:29.600 --> 59:33.035
Wally, this better not
be a waste of time.

59:33.037 --> 59:34.102
I'm telling you, boss.

59:34.104 --> 59:35.470
If anyone can get
that ring back,

59:35.472 --> 59:37.472
it's my Uncle Harry.

59:38.242 --> 59:40.108
Dip.

59:42.580 --> 59:45.914
Oh, he's cool.

59:49.153 --> 59:51.219
Dylan: Are you sure
this guy's

59:51.221 --> 59:52.621
a certified
dog whisperer?

59:52.623 --> 59:54.273
Oh, yeah, boss.

59:54.274 --> 59:55.924
My mom said he normally
only works with racing dogs,

59:55.926 --> 01:00:00.495
and she said he was
on <i> that's incredible.</i>

01:00:02.733 --> 01:00:04.499
Man: Next.

01:00:04.501 --> 01:00:06.568
That's us.

01:00:13.844 --> 01:00:15.777
Hey, Uncle Harry.

01:00:15.779 --> 01:00:17.479
Hey, Wally.

01:00:18.415 --> 01:00:20.983
They add a little
too much batter

01:00:20.985 --> 01:00:22.484
at the cloning lab?

01:00:22.486 --> 01:00:24.186
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

01:00:24.188 --> 01:00:26.655
Hey, I see large
and small.

01:00:26.657 --> 01:00:29.057
What happened to medium?

01:00:31.495 --> 01:00:33.629
We get it.

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:35.764
Uncle Harry taught me how
to wrestle when I was 7.

01:00:35.766 --> 01:00:37.299
Wally!

01:00:37.635 --> 01:00:39.801
Don't forget about
our little secret.

01:00:39.803 --> 01:00:42.137
Can we talk
about the ring?

01:00:48.946 --> 01:00:50.846
Thank you.

01:01:02.493 --> 01:01:04.593
Is he always this quiet?

01:01:09.133 --> 01:01:11.600
What's that? Really.

01:01:11.602 --> 01:01:13.335
You don't say.

01:01:13.337 --> 01:01:15.003
You don't say!

01:01:15.005 --> 01:01:16.038
What is it?

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.707
He didn't say.

01:01:21.345 --> 01:01:23.011
Uh, come on,
Uncle Harry.

01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:25.447
We really gotta
get that ring.

01:01:25.449 --> 01:01:27.949
Ok, ok!

01:01:29.286 --> 01:01:31.987
All right, come on.

01:01:31.989 --> 01:01:35.357
Talk to me, baby.

01:01:39.463 --> 01:01:41.396
I see.

I'm sorry, kids.

I just have to tell you
I'm really impressed.

I think the food is a-plus.
Congratulations.

01:14:07.010 --> 01:14:09.610
Thank you. Does that
mean we get the loan?

Oh, no, no, no,
it doesn't hurt,

01:14:11.648 --> 01:14:14.315
but, son, when I loan money,
I'm not just looking

01:14:14.317 --> 01:14:16.617

and credit references

01:14:17.754 --> 01:14:20.087

and commitment as well.

Oh, we are committed,
and I'll tell you what.

01:14:23.159 --> 01:14:25.326

loan, your first meal

is comped.

I'll tell you what, son.

they're all comped.

the audition?

wait until later.

Of course he did.

Ok.

And what if rene's correct,
and I should wait?

01:15:46.876 --> 01:15:49.210
Hey, rene doesn't
want you to audition

01:15:49.212 --> 01:15:51.245

how great you are.

01:15:51.247 --> 01:15:54.615

so you'll need him.

of my way.

This is not you acting
like this. This is him.

Come on, baby. This isn't
in you to do such a thing.

01:16:17.173 --> 01:16:18.973
You're wrong.

who tried to stop you.

Give this to ubermann.

bootleg I made

the Hollywood bowl.

in one of the swans.

01:28:56.932 --> 01:28:59.299
You know how you spend
your whole life

01:28:59.301 --> 01:29:01.134
looking for
the perfect one,

01:29:01.136 --> 01:29:02.369
you finally find it,

01:29:02.371 --> 01:29:04.538
and you let it slip
through your fingers?

01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:07.541
Buddy, it's just
a piece of furniture.

01:29:07.543 --> 01:29:09.076
I'm not talking
about the furniture,

01:29:09.078 --> 01:29:11.545
I'm talking about
a girl.

01:29:11.547 --> 01:29:13.980
<i> The</i> girl.

01:29:14.083 --> 01:29:15.315
Everything
was perfect,

01:29:15.317 --> 01:29:17.150
and I ruined it.

01:29:17.152 --> 01:29:18.885
I'm so stupid.

01:29:18.887 --> 01:29:19.820
That's touching,

01:29:19.822 --> 01:29:21.788
but you're still
not getting an address.

01:29:21.790 --> 01:29:25.792
Now get off of there
before you hurt yourself.

01:29:26.662 --> 01:29:29.262
Too late.

01:29:34.203 --> 01:29:36.636
God.

01:29:43.812 --> 01:29:45.979
That about does it.

01:29:46.482 --> 01:29:47.614
Thank you.

01:29:47.616 --> 01:29:48.448
I'll have my guys
come in

01:29:48.450 --> 01:29:51.218
and take care of
this trash for you.

01:29:54.923 --> 01:29:56.189
For what it's worth,

01:29:56.191 --> 01:29:58.992

throw all this out,

01:30:06.368 --> 01:30:08.902

if I keep this?

01:30:20.015 --> 01:30:21.214
Thank you.

01:30:23.452 --> 01:30:25.652
Boss, can I get you
anything to drink?

01:30:25.654 --> 01:30:27.954
Uh, no, I'm good.
Thanks.

01:30:27.956 --> 01:30:29.589
Hey, what are you guys
doing with that?

01:30:29.591 --> 01:30:32.492
We're throwing it
away. It's junk.

01:30:32.494 --> 01:30:33.260
Well--

01:30:33.262 --> 01:30:34.961
here, check it out.

01:30:34.963 --> 01:30:36.530

[Laughs]

01:30:36.532 --> 01:30:38.165
Look at this.
I don't believe it.

01:30:38.167 --> 01:30:40.200
I mean, we actually
did it.

01:30:40.202 --> 01:30:42.936
I know. This is--
this is great, man.

01:30:42.938 --> 01:30:45.071
Oh, this is great, man.

01:30:45.073 --> 01:30:46.606
Come on, buddy.
Snap out of it.

01:30:46.608 --> 01:30:47.774
I know. I'm sorry,
buddy.

01:30:47.776 --> 01:30:49.476
I'm gonna go
show these to Gail.

01:30:49.478 --> 01:30:51.478
Ok.

01:30:52.881 --> 01:30:53.613
Hey, boss,

01:30:53.615 --> 01:30:55.148
I'll be back
in about an hour.

01:30:55.150 --> 01:30:56.883
Wally, come here
for a minute.

01:30:56.885 --> 01:30:59.419
Oh, sure thing,
boss. What's up?

01:30:59.421 --> 01:31:00.754
Let me have this.

01:31:00.756 --> 01:31:02.589
I need to go for a drive.

01:31:02.591 --> 01:31:04.591
Take the floor for me?

01:31:04.593 --> 01:31:07.594
[Laughs] You almost
got me again, boss.

01:31:07.596 --> 01:31:09.429
That was good.
That was good.

01:31:09.431 --> 01:31:12.599
I'm serious, man.
Cover for me?

01:31:13.268 --> 01:31:16.837
Yes! Yes! Ha ha.

01:31:24.613 --> 01:31:26.713

01:31:28.283 --> 01:31:30.417

01:31:32.254 --> 01:31:34.154
Hey.

01:31:35.123 --> 01:31:37.524
Jack. Wait!

01:31:38.026 --> 01:31:39.926
Jack.

01:31:40.429 --> 01:31:41.728
Come here, buddy.

01:31:41.730 --> 01:31:44.030
Jack?

01:31:44.366 --> 01:31:45.432
Where are you?

01:31:45.434 --> 01:31:49.169
Still chasing
the same old dog?

01:31:49.171 --> 01:31:50.337
And what are you
going to do

01:31:50.339 --> 01:31:52.806
when you catch him,
kidnap him again?

01:31:52.808 --> 01:31:54.741
You know what,
I deserve that.

01:31:54.743 --> 01:31:58.712
I did a bad thing.
I was wrong.

01:31:58.714 --> 01:32:00.647
But you know what?

01:32:00.649 --> 01:32:04.050
I think we had fun
together.

01:32:04.953 --> 01:32:08.722
And you and I
did ok, too.

01:32:09.658 --> 01:32:10.590
So--

01:32:10.592 --> 01:32:12.759
so what?

01:32:13.262 --> 01:32:14.494
So--

01:32:14.496 --> 01:32:16.730
so.

01:32:16.965 --> 01:32:20.233
Show me your boobs.

01:32:21.703 --> 01:32:23.069
Ok.

01:32:23.071 --> 01:32:24.337
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

01:32:24.339 --> 01:32:25.372
Don't. I was kidding.

01:32:25.374 --> 01:32:29.142
Jack just ate,
and I...[Laughs]

01:32:29.144 --> 01:32:30.443
You know what?

01:32:30.445 --> 01:32:31.645
Look at this place.

01:32:31.647 --> 01:32:34.314
Remember what I said about
conquering your fears up here?

01:32:34.316 --> 01:32:35.399
Forget it.

01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:36.483
This place would
scare me shitless.

01:32:36.485 --> 01:32:38.952
My God. Look at
all the seats.

01:32:38.954 --> 01:32:41.621
So what are you
doing here?

01:32:41.823 --> 01:32:45.325
This is a special place
for me.

01:32:45.327 --> 01:32:47.961
I once made out with
a cello player up there.

01:32:47.963 --> 01:32:49.629
Oh, yeah.

01:32:49.631 --> 01:32:52.198
Truth is, she got
a little handsy, and...

01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:55.235
I'm a bit of a prude,
so that didn't fly.

01:32:55.237 --> 01:32:57.270
[Sniffs]

01:32:57.573 --> 01:33:00.874
You know what they say
about cellists?

01:33:00.876 --> 01:33:02.309
They do it in a chair

01:33:02.311 --> 01:33:04.711
with their legs
spread wide.

01:33:04.713 --> 01:33:05.712
Good God, ma'am.

01:33:05.714 --> 01:33:07.914
There's a dog
in our presence.

01:33:07.916 --> 01:33:10.250
Oh, I know.

01:33:10.519 --> 01:33:13.553
And he misses you.

01:33:27.169 --> 01:33:30.704
Wow.
[Laughs]

01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:33.440

out of here.

01:33:33.442 --> 01:33:35.809
Yeah.

01:33:36.111 --> 01:33:37.410
So why did you
come here?

01:33:37.412 --> 01:33:38.545
Was it my letters?

01:33:38.547 --> 01:33:42.515
No. They were nice,
but...

01:33:42.517 --> 01:33:44.718
Was it the hat?

01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:46.386
No.

01:33:46.388 --> 01:33:48.088
It was the party.

01:33:48.090 --> 01:33:50.590
Oh, when I gave
the tape to ubermann.

01:33:50.592 --> 01:33:51.791
No.

01:33:51.793 --> 01:33:54.094
When you sang.

01:33:54.096 --> 01:33:55.712
Really?

01:33:55.713 --> 01:33:57.329
I didn't know
you could be so sexy.

01:33:57.332 --> 01:33:59.132
[Laughs] Oh, yeah.

01:33:59.134 --> 01:34:01.434

a Neil diamond fan.

01:34:24.393 --> 01:34:26.326

do I have to stay

01:34:26.328 --> 01:34:28.094
in this God-forsaken

01:34:28.096 --> 01:34:29.429

another 10 minutes

01:34:29.431 --> 01:34:30.897

I'm sorry.

01:35:00.262 --> 01:35:01.661
He's the one
who did it.

01:35:01.663 --> 01:35:04.764
He patted my bottom,
put me in his lap.
