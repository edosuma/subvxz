- Make a choice.
- Make a choice.

02:34.869 --> 02:37.172
I've been across.

02:50.785 --> 02:54.288
Oh, did you doze off there?

02:54.290 --> 02:56.789
Well, when you see how white they are,

02:56.791 --> 03:00.993
you are going to be so glad you came in.

03:00.995 --> 03:03.830
So, big plans for prom?

03:03.832 --> 03:07.300
- Mm-hmm.
- Give her suction.

03:07.302 --> 03:09.670
Are you excited?

03:09.672 --> 03:11.937
Yeah.

03:11.939 --> 03:14.508
- Totally, thanks.
- Good.

03:14.510 --> 03:18.014
Well, you're gonna look great.

03:23.385 --> 03:27.188
- How do you know if something is...
- Thank you.

03:28.057 --> 03:30.092
Real?

03:32.727 --> 03:33.993
When you wake up...

03:33.995 --> 03:36.629
- Annie.
- Hi, yeah.

03:36.631 --> 03:40.700
...how do you know for sure
that you're not still dreaming?

03:40.702 --> 03:43.204
Have a good time at the prom.

03:46.642 --> 03:48.878
Thank you.

03:54.616 --> 03:57.787
Hurry up, Luce. They're gonna be here soon.

04:04.459 --> 04:06.026
When I was a little girl,

04:06.028 --> 04:08.495
my big sister used to make me get married

04:08.497 --> 04:10.830
to the little boy down
the street over and over.

04:10.832 --> 04:15.468
She put me in my cousin's old prom dress.

04:15.470 --> 04:17.437
Annie, the limo's here!

04:17.439 --> 04:18.738
And then...

04:18.740 --> 04:20.473
Ooh!

04:20.475 --> 04:23.211
I had imagined my real wedding day.

04:27.148 --> 04:31.418
When we were 14, me and my
best friend had a picnic,

04:31.420 --> 04:34.620
and vowed we'd never have sex with anyone

04:34.622 --> 04:36.021
until we were married.

04:36.023 --> 04:37.891
- Hey, hey, hey.
- How are you?

04:37.893 --> 04:39.658
You guys have fun tonight.

04:39.660 --> 04:42.161
Kind of funny how things can change.

04:42.163 --> 04:44.798
- Bye.
- Bye.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.399
Be safe.

04:46.401 --> 04:48.033
Whoo!

04:48.035 --> 04:50.504
Tonight was the night I was finally free

04:50.506 --> 04:52.875
to do whatever I wanted...

04:54.542 --> 04:57.813
...and everyone was expecting me to.

04:59.948 --> 05:03.753
You gotta check this view
out! Are you seeing this?

05:05.888 --> 05:10.693
So, why did I feel so...

05:11.994 --> 05:13.763
...hollow?

05:18.100 --> 05:21.935
- So.
- So.

05:21.937 --> 05:25.838
God, you look so beautiful tonight.

05:25.840 --> 05:27.673
Think so?

05:27.675 --> 05:29.875
Totally.

05:29.877 --> 05:31.946
Thanks.

05:39.655 --> 05:42.588
So, um, are you cool with going back

05:42.590 --> 05:44.523
to The Radisson later?

05:44.525 --> 05:46.459
In fact, we rented out the whole floor.

05:46.461 --> 05:47.660
Rick put down his dad's credit card.

05:47.662 --> 05:49.596
It's gonna be pretty cool

05:49.598 --> 05:52.898
and Annie said there's like
a hot tub in the room, so...

05:52.900 --> 05:55.701
- Yeah?
- Sure.

05:55.703 --> 05:57.603
Hey, look what we found! Look at that.

05:57.605 --> 05:58.939
What?

05:58.941 --> 06:01.240
Oh! Sheldon, stop it!

06:01.242 --> 06:03.610
Stop! Get off!

06:03.612 --> 06:05.245
Uh!

06:06.949 --> 06:09.716
What is this whole "not sure" thing?

06:09.718 --> 06:13.487
I mean, he's done everything right,

06:13.489 --> 06:15.488
hasn't he?

06:15.490 --> 06:18.023
At least you get to go to
prom with your boyfriend.

06:18.025 --> 06:20.060
- Hi-yah!
- If I'm gonna get laid tonight

06:20.062 --> 06:22.498
I'm gonna have to sleep
with the limo driver.

06:25.033 --> 06:28.770
Hey, fuck Tom.

06:29.537 --> 06:31.838
- Fuck Tom.
- I know.

06:31.840 --> 06:33.639
We're gonna have fun.

06:33.641 --> 06:35.574
We're gonna have fun.
We're already having fun.

06:35.576 --> 06:36.877
- Yeah.
- Everything worked out really well.

06:36.879 --> 06:38.144
Yeah, you're right.

06:38.146 --> 06:39.849
Yeah.

07:27.228 --> 07:30.663
Guy in the red.

07:30.665 --> 07:33.667
- No.
- No?

07:33.669 --> 07:35.235
No, no, no.

07:35.237 --> 07:36.836
The girl in the red.

07:36.838 --> 07:40.139
Why are you trying to
hook me up with people?

08:10.338 --> 08:12.107
What?

08:14.076 --> 08:16.843
- Mmm.
- Gosh.

08:16.845 --> 08:18.177
Dude, she wants a man over her.

08:18.179 --> 08:19.946
It ain't even Lucy talking, dude.

08:19.948 --> 08:21.348
They're all, like, giggling and shit.

08:21.350 --> 08:24.249
I don't know, dude.

08:24.251 --> 08:26.052
- I know.
- I know.

08:26.054 --> 08:27.954
She looks so fucking good tonight.

08:27.956 --> 08:29.723
Gosh, she's just like...

08:29.725 --> 08:32.692
She's like... sometimes
it's just like, shit.

08:32.693 --> 08:35.629
- Shit.
- I'm going to get it.

08:35.631 --> 08:37.230
- Senior prom.
- Senior prom.

08:37.232 --> 08:39.969
- I know, dude, I know.
- Senior prom.

08:52.981 --> 08:57.652
Hey, no. Are you okay?

08:59.721 --> 09:02.721
Do you ever feel like you're
just going through the motions?

09:02.723 --> 09:05.958
What do you mean?

09:05.960 --> 09:08.662
I don't know, like, this
doesn't actually mean anything.

09:08.664 --> 09:11.063
What?

09:11.065 --> 09:13.399
I don't know. You know
what... Never mind, never mind

09:13.401 --> 09:15.668
No, no, no.

09:15.670 --> 09:18.437
- No, I don't know what I'm talking about.
- Tell me.

09:18.439 --> 09:22.274
I don't know, Annie, I just feel like I...

09:22.276 --> 09:25.912
- What?
- I just want something real to happen to me for once.

09:25.914 --> 09:27.616
Well?

09:30.151 --> 09:32.053
Just stop.

09:33.822 --> 09:36.889
Why do I think so much?

09:36.891 --> 09:38.457
Thank you. Thank you.

09:38.459 --> 09:41.027
Why? Why do you think so much?

09:41.029 --> 09:42.361
Lucy?

09:42.363 --> 09:44.163
Well, you know there is another reason

09:44.165 --> 09:46.265
why I've been waiting with Jake.

09:46.267 --> 09:48.400
Why?

09:48.402 --> 09:51.971
Because of his penis.

09:51.973 --> 09:54.139
Is there something that we need to discuss?

09:54.141 --> 09:57.409
You know that I don't have
a lot to compare it to.

09:57.411 --> 09:58.912
Mm-hmm.

09:58.914 --> 10:00.413
I'm concerned about his size.

10:00.415 --> 10:02.315
Very concerning.

10:02.317 --> 10:05.284
Might it be more like this?

10:05.286 --> 10:07.821
Or perhaps more like this?

10:07.823 --> 10:10.956
Or maybe like that?

10:10.958 --> 10:13.092
Stop! It's huge.

10:13.094 --> 10:14.860
Fuck, yeah. Fuck, yeah.

10:14.862 --> 10:16.129
He's a football player.

10:16.131 --> 10:17.864
Yeah.

10:17.866 --> 10:21.267
He's a football player
downstairs, and it's scary.

10:24.740 --> 10:26.608
Oh, my God.

10:31.146 --> 10:33.480
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:33.482 --> 10:36.349
Hi.

10:58.939 --> 11:01.273
- Right here. Do you want a hit?
- I'm gonna stay.

11:01.275 --> 11:03.009
Uh, hit me, please.

11:06.915 --> 11:08.981
One more. One more. One more. One more.

11:08.983 --> 11:11.350
One more. One more. One.

11:11.352 --> 11:13.186
All right! I won, again!

11:13.188 --> 11:15.090
Again! It's my game.

11:15.790 --> 11:16.956
Okay, look up.

11:16.958 --> 11:18.490
I just won. I'm hot right now.

11:18.492 --> 11:20.994
Do me... like, kiss it. I'm gonna do great.

11:20.996 --> 11:22.928
Come on. All right.

11:22.930 --> 11:24.264
Stay with me. Come on.

11:24.266 --> 11:26.331
Don't give me that
look. Don't give me that.

11:26.333 --> 11:29.067
Look, I'm going to go
get in line for pictures.

11:29.069 --> 11:31.804
And then, you'll meet me there, yeah?

11:31.806 --> 11:33.273
Oh, yes, all right, that sounds good.

11:33.275 --> 11:36.576
That sounds good. Yeah. 20! Whoo!

11:36.578 --> 11:39.345
Yeah, it sounds good.

11:43.551 --> 11:45.720
Whoo! Yeah.

12:13.949 --> 12:16.014
- Hi.
- What's up?

12:16.016 --> 12:20.485
- Jacob is not feeling good.
- What?

12:20.487 --> 12:24.057
- As long as I see smiles.
- Look, can you squeeze a little toy

12:24.059 --> 12:25.524
and make us laugh?

12:25.526 --> 12:28.561
Best friend.

12:28.563 --> 12:30.163
Congratulate them.

12:30.165 --> 12:34.299
Good for you! You get it. You go.

12:34.301 --> 12:36.101
Enjoy the rest of prom.

12:38.205 --> 12:41.374
He's probably, like...
I mean, it's been a while,

12:41.376 --> 12:43.976
so I highly doubt he's horrible.

12:43.978 --> 12:46.546
- We can go soon.
- I don't want to get drunk.

12:46.548 --> 12:48.514
- I wanted tonight to be special.
- Oh, wait.

12:48.516 --> 12:51.918
- What?
- Oh, sorry.

12:51.920 --> 12:53.152
It still is special.

12:53.154 --> 12:55.120
Oh, not in the right way.

12:55.122 --> 12:58.157
Come on. Come on, trooper.

12:58.159 --> 13:01.126
God, you're gonna be fucked up so bad.

13:01.128 --> 13:03.363
I know.

13:03.365 --> 13:05.465
Do you think you're gonna maybe...

13:05.467 --> 13:08.167
Do you think, maybe, he just be better now?

13:08.169 --> 13:11.070
Yeah, I mean... probably.

13:11.072 --> 13:13.639
Jake? Jacob?

13:13.641 --> 13:16.208
You guys picked real
winners for prom dates.

13:16.210 --> 13:18.076
He's passed out. You okay?

13:18.078 --> 13:20.480
Oh, fuck, I blacked out, babe.

13:20.482 --> 13:22.783
Yeah, we know, Jacob.

13:25.520 --> 13:28.421
- Oh, hey, whoa.
- Hi.

13:28.423 --> 13:32.091
- Jacob.
- You're, like, the hottest girl in the school.

13:32.093 --> 13:35.564
Um, so, how was it?

13:38.132 --> 13:39.966
I don't know.

13:39.968 --> 13:42.268
This is our night.

13:42.270 --> 13:45.538
Whoa, Jacob. Whoa, shit.

13:45.540 --> 13:48.106
- Stop, what are you...
- I'm ready. We're ready.

13:48.108 --> 13:51.644
- We're ready.
- Jacob, stop! Stop!

13:51.646 --> 13:53.479
- Stop!
- Right there.

13:53.481 --> 13:55.480
Hold up! Jacob, stop!

13:55.482 --> 13:56.716
Whoa!

13:56.718 --> 13:59.585
Eww.

13:59.587 --> 14:01.387
You fucking asshole!

14:01.389 --> 14:02.989
I love you, baby.

14:02.991 --> 14:04.590
You fucking ruined everything.

14:04.592 --> 14:08.427
Oh, God.

14:08.429 --> 14:10.566
Annie, come on, please.

14:11.433 --> 14:15.033
I'm sorry, Lu. I'm sorry, Luce.

14:15.035 --> 14:17.403
That was so awful!

14:17.405 --> 14:18.671
Why did we go there?

14:18.673 --> 14:21.975
I know, I know, it's not okay.

14:21.977 --> 14:24.576
- He's an idiot.
- Oh, whatever!

14:24.578 --> 14:26.211
- Whatever!
- Yeah.

14:26.213 --> 14:30.317
- I'm done.
- I know. I know.

14:31.049 --> 14:32.518
Smoking?

14:32.520 --> 14:36.489
Oh, baby.

14:36.491 --> 14:39.192
- What's wrong with me?
- Nothing?

14:39.194 --> 14:42.497
- I'm messed up.
- Nothing. It's nothing. You're not messed up.

14:46.133 --> 14:48.033
Atta girl.

14:48.035 --> 14:51.303
Hey, where's your quarterback?

14:51.305 --> 14:55.374
There's been a little change in plans, huh?

14:55.376 --> 14:58.277
Jake nearly threw up on Lucy's dress,

14:58.279 --> 15:03.015
and my date is somewhere
cause we're not even friends.

15:03.017 --> 15:07.052
And, uh, well, my boyfriend of
two years just broke up with me.

15:07.054 --> 15:09.654
- Stop.
- So, ta-da!

15:09.656 --> 15:12.591
You guys are funny.

15:12.593 --> 15:15.628
Yeah, um...

15:15.630 --> 15:18.530
But, hey, made it out puke free, right?

15:18.532 --> 15:21.067
- Let's go.
- And we're gonna have a good time.

15:21.069 --> 15:22.534
I want to listen to this.

15:22.536 --> 15:26.438
Yeah, well, we're going to The Honor Farm.

15:26.440 --> 15:28.341
Hey, what's The Honor Farm?

15:28.343 --> 15:31.177
It's this old abandoned prison,

15:31.179 --> 15:33.546
and we've got shrooms.

15:33.548 --> 15:36.349
You can come with us, if you want,

15:36.351 --> 15:39.684
or you can just stand
there pretending to smoke.

15:44.258 --> 15:46.591
Let's just do it. Let's just do it.

15:46.593 --> 15:48.628
What?

15:48.630 --> 15:50.696
- What about the limo?
- Fuck the limo.

15:50.698 --> 15:52.164
- God.
- Come on.

15:52.166 --> 15:54.335
- Oh, this is so insane.
- Hey, hey, hey.

16:00.442 --> 16:04.210
So, you've never been in The Honor Farm?

16:04.212 --> 16:06.379
No.

16:06.381 --> 16:10.316
Here you are. Everclear, babies.

16:12.286 --> 16:14.320
Oh, my God.

16:14.322 --> 16:18.527
Quick, drink her dress! Drink her dress!

16:19.761 --> 16:21.626
Two people died out there freshman year.

16:21.628 --> 16:23.763
- What?
- You guys never heard about that?

16:23.765 --> 16:28.167
- No.
- You'll believe it when you see it for yourself.

16:28.169 --> 16:30.503
No, dude, dude, dude,
it's seriously freaky.

16:30.505 --> 16:34.407
I have some stuff left over
from satanic rituals and shit.

16:34.409 --> 16:36.842
Dead chickens.

16:36.844 --> 16:38.510
Blood trails.

16:38.512 --> 16:40.278
That's totally weird.

16:40.280 --> 16:42.715
Don't worry, you'll be
fine. I brought a knife.

16:57.365 --> 17:01.333
Help! Save me!

17:18.453 --> 17:23.588
- Oh, my God!
- Fuck my dress!

17:23.589 --> 17:26.223
- Oh, no.
- Wanna borrow some clothes?

17:26.226 --> 17:27.727
Yeah.

17:27.729 --> 17:32.397
I've got these, too. Whoever wants them.

17:32.399 --> 17:34.567
Thank you.

17:34.569 --> 17:36.669
I don't have any more of those, sorry.

17:36.671 --> 17:38.173
Thanks.

17:40.375 --> 17:41.943
Whoo!

17:45.746 --> 17:47.548
Annie?

17:48.750 --> 17:51.653
Ooh, people!

17:57.291 --> 17:59.592
Oh, shit, that's my jam.

18:02.329 --> 18:05.932
Give me that right there,
gimme, gimme, gimme.

18:05.934 --> 18:09.669
Oh, my God. I don't
know any of these people.

18:09.671 --> 18:12.238
I know. One of them is in my English class.

18:12.240 --> 18:16.576
And then the other one,
well, Jesse's like...

18:16.578 --> 18:18.743
He's like the biggest
drug dealer in school.

18:18.745 --> 18:19.811
- What?
- Yes.

18:19.813 --> 18:22.347
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

18:22.349 --> 18:23.951
Hi.

18:28.489 --> 18:31.624
How much do y'all want?

18:31.626 --> 18:33.561
Um, I don't know.

18:37.764 --> 18:42.468
I... like, okay, like this much, maybe?

18:42.470 --> 18:44.369
I'm not trying to babysit you all night.

18:46.241 --> 18:49.741
Have you guys tripped much before?

18:49.743 --> 18:52.845
- Not really.
- No.

18:52.847 --> 18:55.347
No, we haven't ever
taken much, we're just...

18:55.349 --> 18:58.483
Okay, okay. Well, we're gonna have fun,

18:58.485 --> 18:59.751
but, you know, according to Jesse,

18:59.753 --> 19:02.421
these are really strong ones, so...

19:02.423 --> 19:04.658
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:08.428 --> 19:10.564
How much do we take?

19:18.873 --> 19:20.942
Looks perfect.

19:24.279 --> 19:26.278
Thanks.

19:26.280 --> 19:27.813
I'm JD, by the way.

19:27.815 --> 19:30.383
- I'm Annie.
- I'm Lucy.

19:30.385 --> 19:32.854
Nice to meet you.

19:34.621 --> 19:38.457
The things I do for you.

19:38.459 --> 19:40.960
- This was your idea.
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

19:40.962 --> 19:43.596
'Cause I'm trying to make you feel better.

19:43.598 --> 19:46.798
Well, good job.

19:46.800 --> 19:49.000
Are we really eating these?

19:49.002 --> 19:52.872
- Bon apétit.
- Thank you.

19:52.874 --> 19:55.340
Hmm. Cow shit flavor, my favorite.

19:55.342 --> 19:58.009
Hey, don't rag on the merchandise.

19:58.011 --> 19:59.613
Uch.

20:05.052 --> 20:08.453
All right, babies, no turning back now.

20:08.455 --> 20:09.989
Oh, my God.

20:09.991 --> 20:11.826
Yummy.

20:16.364 --> 20:18.029
Is The Honor Farm far from here?

20:18.031 --> 20:20.833
It will be after this.

20:20.835 --> 20:22.701
Well, you know what they say,

20:22.703 --> 20:24.737
it's the journey, not the destination.

20:24.739 --> 20:26.471
Ralph Emerson.

20:26.473 --> 20:30.675
Wow, someone paid attention
in English last week.

20:30.677 --> 20:33.612
So, have you all been
to The Honor Farm before?

20:33.614 --> 20:36.015
I heard they found some
mutilated babies out there.

20:36.017 --> 20:38.683
- What?
- Seriously.

20:38.685 --> 20:42.054
Yeah, I saw a severed
goat leg out there once.

20:42.056 --> 20:43.955
Blood written all over the walls.

20:47.895 --> 20:49.729
The Honor Farm was a work farm,

20:49.731 --> 20:51.463
for the federal penitentiary,

20:51.465 --> 20:55.567
Bastrop... During the 1920s and '30s.

20:55.569 --> 20:57.970
Despite the scenic
setting, it had a reputation

20:57.972 --> 21:00.705
for being a brutal, cruel facility.

21:00.707 --> 21:04.143
Many of the inmates were killed,

21:04.145 --> 21:08.446
tortured, or just disappeared.

21:08.448 --> 21:10.548
Once the state found out about it all,

21:10.550 --> 21:13.051
they closed the farm down,

21:13.053 --> 21:16.489
but two decades of brutality
left the place haunted

21:16.491 --> 21:20.492
by the angry spirits of the dead convicts.

21:21.796 --> 21:23.662
So now,

21:23.664 --> 21:28.800
Devil worshipers and
satanists do dark magic rituals

21:28.802 --> 21:31.936
and human sacrifice.

21:36.511 --> 21:40.413
Saved the beer. Sorry, man,
I was just taking a piss.

21:40.415 --> 21:43.749
Now our light's all fucked.

22:07.107 --> 22:09.008
- Wanna know a secret?
- Mm-hmm.

22:09.010 --> 22:10.875
So I was at the bookstore today,

22:10.877 --> 22:12.778
and I was talking to this old guy

22:12.780 --> 22:15.614
and he, like, knew all about
the dark arts, for real.

22:15.616 --> 22:18.116
He said if I burn this
tonight at The Honor Farm,

22:18.118 --> 22:21.519
it'll pull a spirit
back from the other side.

22:21.521 --> 22:24.155
It's like a ouija board,
but it's not bullshit,

22:24.157 --> 22:25.723
it should actually work.

22:25.725 --> 22:28.693
- Freaky.
- I know, I'm so excited.

22:28.695 --> 22:31.564
Are you sure you want to
do that at The Honor Farm?

22:31.566 --> 22:33.932
Yeah, dude. It's like the
most powerful spiritual vortex

22:33.934 --> 22:37.569
- within like a thousand miles.
- You want to talk to ghosts.

22:37.571 --> 22:40.874
No, I wanna talk to Sam.

22:43.010 --> 22:45.478
Are you feeling anything?

22:45.480 --> 22:47.115
I don't know.

22:48.515 --> 22:52.084
Yeah, I think I am.

22:52.086 --> 22:53.853
Oh, wow.

22:53.855 --> 22:55.520
Bye-bye.

22:55.522 --> 22:57.091
Wait.

23:07.234 --> 23:10.971
Mom? Hi, Mom.

23:13.508 --> 23:16.040
I love you.

23:16.042 --> 23:19.211
I love your mom.

23:19.213 --> 23:21.416
Me, too.

23:25.520 --> 23:27.856
Look at that old tree.

23:34.561 --> 23:36.430
You okay?

23:38.065 --> 23:41.901
Yeah, it's a weird feeling.

23:41.903 --> 23:44.272
Don't worry.

24:08.296 --> 24:10.498
Fire.

24:13.099 --> 24:15.901
I need fire.

24:15.903 --> 24:19.270
Of course you do.

24:19.272 --> 24:21.109
I have fire.

24:28.148 --> 24:30.083
Thank you.

24:41.194 --> 24:44.898
- She's cold.
- Yeah.

25:22.168 --> 25:25.873
We are all everyone and
no one at the same time.

25:28.408 --> 25:32.246
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:33.713 --> 25:36.117
Humanity is expanding...

25:38.319 --> 25:40.853
...in every direction across the globe.

25:40.855 --> 25:45.657
Soon no culture will have
the elbow room it once had,

25:45.659 --> 25:48.394
its function, and its old ways.

25:48.396 --> 25:52.166
This puts personal freedom
at risk of being erased.

25:54.100 --> 25:58.103
Social media brings issues to people,

25:58.105 --> 26:00.439
but it is also in new venue

26:00.441 --> 26:02.874
for an elevated sense of self.

26:02.876 --> 26:05.877
The higher the self,
the less connected it is

26:05.879 --> 26:08.747
to the people around it.

26:08.749 --> 26:11.185
It can't actually disconnect.

26:16.057 --> 26:18.292
That's an illusion.

26:19.859 --> 26:21.595
You wanna come see my rocks?

26:23.963 --> 26:27.068
Yeah, totally.

26:30.370 --> 26:31.836
Wow.

26:31.838 --> 26:34.405
Look at the moon.

26:34.407 --> 26:36.511
Oh, incredible.

26:40.981 --> 26:43.952
Did we lose the rest of everyone?

26:45.853 --> 26:48.220
Lose?

26:48.222 --> 26:49.755
We're all winners.

26:49.757 --> 26:53.094
It's okay. It's perfect.

26:57.831 --> 27:04.205
I can feel every one of
those stars right now.

27:05.740 --> 27:07.241
Yeah.

27:09.443 --> 27:11.980
I can touch them.

27:22.857 --> 27:26.561
Look, the air is a web.

27:28.796 --> 27:31.195
The air is a web right there.

27:31.197 --> 27:33.400
Don't break it.

27:39.173 --> 27:40.675
Ow.

27:44.278 --> 27:46.347
We need to find JD.

27:47.848 --> 27:49.314
JD?

27:49.316 --> 27:52.518
It's too hot.

27:52.520 --> 27:54.254
JD?

28:00.927 --> 28:05.166
Do you ever feel like
there's a part of you missing?

28:11.070 --> 28:16.543
I feel like a part of
me was never made yet.

28:18.913 --> 28:21.880
Like I never managed it.

28:21.882 --> 28:24.318
I lost mine.

28:35.930 --> 28:39.067
Whoa, I'm crying.

28:42.069 --> 28:46.971
Sometimes when I think back
and try to remember stuff

28:46.973 --> 28:49.540
that happened a long time ago,

28:49.542 --> 28:54.215
like when me and my brother,
Sam, went to swimming camp,

28:56.282 --> 28:58.452
it doesn't even seem real anymore.

29:00.921 --> 29:03.590
It feels kind of like it never happened.

29:05.326 --> 29:09.627
Almost the same thing as
having a really vivid dream,

29:09.629 --> 29:13.365
and waking up,

29:13.367 --> 29:17.935
and trying to remember the details.

29:17.937 --> 29:21.073
It's like we are what we
are for this one moment,

29:21.075 --> 29:25.344
and then the different versions of us

29:25.346 --> 29:28.012
just fade into the past.

29:28.014 --> 29:30.851
Just like our dreams.

29:38.024 --> 29:40.594
It's like everything but now is a dream.

29:46.032 --> 29:52.037
Cause you can never know what will happen,

29:52.039 --> 29:57.342
and what has happened
is always fading away.

29:57.344 --> 30:00.248
So it's all about now.

30:05.152 --> 30:07.922
I can see it.

30:17.364 --> 30:21.566
Let's go. Let's go to The Honor Farm.

30:21.568 --> 30:23.367
You all right?

30:23.369 --> 30:26.104
Laila. Laila.

30:26.106 --> 30:29.106
- Hey, Laila.
- You fucking lost me.

30:31.645 --> 30:34.682
This is supposed to be
for you and me, Luce.

30:36.582 --> 30:39.217
- I thought that I lost you.
- I know, you didn't.

30:39.219 --> 30:42.119
I couldn't find you.

30:42.121 --> 30:43.523
I'm right here.

30:45.291 --> 30:50.528
- Okay.
- Okay? Yeah, but I was just really worried.

30:50.530 --> 30:52.699
We're going!

30:54.734 --> 30:57.169
The whole point is that
we go to Honor Farm.

30:57.171 --> 30:59.203
- Okay, okay.
- That's the whole fucking point,

30:59.205 --> 31:01.239
and they're ruining it.

31:01.241 --> 31:04.209
It sucks. Everyone sucks. Let me tell you.

31:04.211 --> 31:06.510
Having said that, you have to...

31:06.512 --> 31:10.382
- You have to tell them.
- No, it's not as easy for me when I go up there

31:10.384 --> 31:12.183
as it is for you, apparently.

31:12.185 --> 31:14.254
I'll think it over.

31:17.257 --> 31:18.726
Come on.

31:20.661 --> 31:23.662
- All right, things look good.
- Are you sure we're going the right way?

31:23.664 --> 31:27.231
Mm-hmm. JD, slow down!

31:27.233 --> 31:29.468
- It was the wrong way...
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

31:29.470 --> 31:33.171
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, Annie, are you okay?

31:33.173 --> 31:35.272
It's okay.

31:35.274 --> 31:38.343
- You don't know where...
- No, I don't know.

31:38.345 --> 31:39.544
Check over here.

31:39.546 --> 31:41.680
Go!

31:41.682 --> 31:43.781
Wait!

31:43.783 --> 31:46.286
We're here.

31:51.558 --> 31:54.058
Look.

31:54.060 --> 31:55.795
Fuck.

31:57.364 --> 32:01.232
Laila, you okay?

32:01.234 --> 32:03.701
Yeah, I'm fine.

32:03.703 --> 32:05.537
We're all up for this?

32:06.740 --> 32:08.743
Race me!

32:13.746 --> 32:15.446
Last one in The Honor Farm

32:15.448 --> 32:17.651
goes to Hell!

32:30.530 --> 32:33.265
Did girls really die
down here freshman year?

32:33.267 --> 32:35.267
I just heard about that.

32:35.269 --> 32:38.372
No, no, that's just a bullshit rumor.

32:42.142 --> 32:44.442
Is that a person?

32:44.444 --> 32:46.545
Oh!

32:46.547 --> 32:50.785
This place is pure evil.

32:56.155 --> 32:59.490
It's alive. It's a vortex.

32:59.492 --> 33:02.463
It can be used for good or evil.

33:05.732 --> 33:10.669
- I wanna build a fire.
- We should explore first.

33:10.671 --> 33:12.770
There's some really weird
shit in the basement.

33:12.772 --> 33:17.241
It's totally fucked. I
can show you if you want.

33:17.243 --> 33:18.876
That's where the murders happened?

33:18.878 --> 33:21.846
Yeah, like there was a... A
corrupt warden, or whatever,

33:21.848 --> 33:27.352
who would tie up the prisoners
and beat and torture them.

33:27.354 --> 33:29.453
A few of them died, apparently.

33:29.455 --> 33:32.392
That's why they shut down
the place back in the day.

33:36.463 --> 33:38.366
Maybe we should go.

33:39.398 --> 33:41.266
You all wanna break up and search it out?

33:41.268 --> 33:43.268
Well, yeah, right on.

33:43.270 --> 33:46.805
- Fuck.
- God.

33:46.807 --> 33:48.839
Do you wanna see the shadows?

33:48.841 --> 33:52.443
Can we go upstairs first?

33:52.445 --> 33:55.346
Uh...

33:58.251 --> 34:00.420
Don't leave. Wait.

34:21.440 --> 34:24.475
- Check this room out.
- Oh, okay.

34:24.476 --> 34:28.212
JD, uh, I'll be right back.

34:28.214 --> 34:29.717
Oh.

34:39.225 --> 34:42.696
- You want?
- Thanks.

34:49.534 --> 34:52.871
So, JD seems pretty into you.

34:58.211 --> 35:00.980
I don't know. I just met him.

35:02.515 --> 35:03.982
Mm-hmm.

35:03.984 --> 35:06.317
He's probably the hottest guy I know.

35:06.319 --> 35:08.953
How long have you known him?

35:08.955 --> 35:11.090
My whole life.

35:14.493 --> 35:17.361
Since we were babies.

35:17.363 --> 35:19.464
He's my best friend in the whole world.

35:19.466 --> 35:21.969
God, he's my only friend.

35:24.738 --> 35:27.939
You know he's like a
certified genius, right?

35:27.941 --> 35:31.008
He's brilliant.

35:31.010 --> 35:35.312
And he's been through a fuck lot.

35:35.314 --> 35:37.848
That's why I wanted us to come here,

35:37.850 --> 35:39.886
to this place.

35:42.356 --> 35:44.257
This place.

36:00.774 --> 36:02.941
With JD, like, honestly, to me,

36:02.943 --> 36:06.745
it seems like he likes you.

36:08.481 --> 36:10.781
What?

36:10.783 --> 36:15.319
I'm sorry. I thought you knew.

36:15.321 --> 36:16.955
He's my cousin.

36:16.957 --> 36:18.455
What?

36:18.457 --> 36:24.029
Yeah.

36:24.031 --> 36:26.100
Oh, my God.

36:28.401 --> 36:30.701
This whole time I thought that you...

36:30.703 --> 36:35.109
So if you hurt him, I'm gonna fuck you up.

36:43.582 --> 36:45.785
Where's Laila?

36:47.586 --> 36:52.089
Whoa. This place is fucked.

36:52.091 --> 36:54.627
Super bad vibes.

37:04.470 --> 37:06.606
What is that?

37:25.658 --> 37:27.994
Why would someone do this?

37:29.930 --> 37:32.930
Oh, fuck.

37:32.932 --> 37:35.168
Where's Laila?

37:51.385 --> 37:53.853
Are you crying?

37:57.022 --> 38:00.159
Sam died in a fire.

38:01.595 --> 38:04.130
And you think fire's bad.

38:05.765 --> 38:08.701
It's not fire's fault.

38:11.937 --> 38:15.506
She just can't help herself.

38:15.508 --> 38:17.877
Who's Sam?

38:18.644 --> 38:21.011
JD's brother.

38:26.886 --> 38:28.955
What is that?

38:31.992 --> 38:34.228
That's why JD moved back here.

38:38.464 --> 38:41.268
Because we lost Sam.

38:48.642 --> 38:50.542
Oh, hey.

38:50.544 --> 38:53.144
Hey, Lail, I've got the candle.

38:53.146 --> 38:55.979
Lucy, come on.

38:55.981 --> 38:57.784
Come on!

38:59.718 --> 39:01.685
We're doing a ceremony.

39:01.687 --> 39:05.223
I know, I'll bring her
right back, Laila, I promise.

39:05.225 --> 39:08.429
- Bye, Laila.
- Bye.

39:18.638 --> 39:20.773
Oh.

39:27.013 --> 39:29.148
Hello.

39:34.888 --> 39:36.724
There they are.

39:39.559 --> 39:43.026
Oh, my God.

39:43.028 --> 39:46.230
Can you even imagine?

39:46.232 --> 39:51.270
There are actually tunnels
that go between the buildings.

39:52.238 --> 39:55.506
Yup, just right through that door there.

39:55.508 --> 39:57.609
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

39:57.611 --> 39:59.209
Let's get out of here.

39:59.211 --> 40:02.046
Wait.

40:02.048 --> 40:04.183
I wanna see the tunnel.

40:11.624 --> 40:14.827
It's cool. We can wait here.

40:19.732 --> 40:22.002
This tunnel leads to the next building.

40:27.908 --> 40:30.073
Huh? You okay?

40:30.075 --> 40:32.310
Are you still feeling it?

40:32.312 --> 40:34.578
Yeah.

40:34.580 --> 40:37.982
You're shining right now.

40:37.984 --> 40:40.250
Even down here...

40:40.252 --> 40:42.556
You're so beautiful.

40:46.258 --> 40:49.061
We should go find Annie and Sinclair.

40:51.231 --> 40:53.964
Let's go in the tunnel.

40:53.966 --> 40:57.404
You wanna go in there?

41:18.191 --> 41:20.991
We bring this water.

41:20.993 --> 41:23.330
Nous venons avec de l'eau.

41:26.332 --> 41:28.600
They wash with water.

41:28.602 --> 41:32.736
Ils se lavent à l'eau.

41:32.738 --> 41:35.205
We wash with fire.

41:35.207 --> 41:37.944
Nous nous lavons avec le feu.

41:46.019 --> 41:51.788
Fire... help us talk to the dead.

41:51.790 --> 41:53.991
- Laila, that's not funny.
- It's not a joke.

41:55.894 --> 41:58.962
Fire, help us talk to the dead.

42:26.725 --> 42:28.228
What was that?

42:29.763 --> 42:33.400
Fire, help us talk to the dead.

42:36.269 --> 42:37.834
Help us.

42:42.709 --> 42:45.743
Sam?

42:45.745 --> 42:47.313
Sam, is that you?

42:51.051 --> 42:53.084
Can we go?

42:53.086 --> 42:56.087
- JD?
- I can't stay down here anymore.

42:56.089 --> 42:58.455
I know.

42:58.457 --> 43:01.395
- Let's go.
- Okay.

43:02.828 --> 43:04.697
What was that?

43:05.932 --> 43:07.799
Let's not freak out. Let's not freak out.

43:07.801 --> 43:09.966
I'm sure it was just Laila.

43:11.805 --> 43:14.839
Laila?

43:21.914 --> 43:23.480
Oh, my God.

43:38.198 --> 43:39.964
Oh.

43:42.234 --> 43:43.433
Is this the spot?

43:43.435 --> 43:45.605
This is the spot.

43:48.274 --> 43:51.011
I thought you were gonna give me pills.

43:54.747 --> 43:56.747
She'd like two, Jim.

43:56.749 --> 43:58.415
She'd love two.

44:06.959 --> 44:09.127
Doc says you can have two.

44:29.515 --> 44:32.319
- Ready to go?
- Yeah, let's go.

44:35.254 --> 44:37.187
Oh, my God!

44:37.189 --> 44:38.522
Shh, shh, shh.

44:38.524 --> 44:41.292
I'm serious. There are people here.

44:41.294 --> 44:43.528
- No, I'm serious.
- There's people with a goat.

44:43.530 --> 44:45.796
I don't know what's going on.

44:58.178 --> 45:01.548
Okay, you know what you're doing?

45:04.149 --> 45:06.352
What did you give me?

45:09.254 --> 45:12.324
I need to lay down.

45:20.300 --> 45:25.203
Hey, do you guys believe
in an alternate universe?

45:28.106 --> 45:30.843
What is all that stuff?

45:34.414 --> 45:37.750
It's fucking Dr. Meyer.

45:38.852 --> 45:40.821
Ready for flight, Doc.

45:50.562 --> 45:52.863
Sam?

45:52.865 --> 45:54.497
Sammy, is that you?

46:01.874 --> 46:03.107
Laila, please stop.

46:03.109 --> 46:04.441
Shut up! Shut the fuck up.

46:04.443 --> 46:07.611
It's working, you're fucking it up.

46:07.613 --> 46:12.283
- Sam, I need to ask you...
- Ask me what?

46:19.191 --> 46:21.225
Chicken butt.

46:21.227 --> 46:24.328
Oh, Jesse?

46:25.964 --> 46:29.332
No! No! No! No!

46:29.334 --> 46:33.236
You fucking ruined it!

46:33.238 --> 46:34.773
Holy shit!

46:42.515 --> 46:44.515
Oh.

46:44.517 --> 46:46.383
Hey!

46:46.385 --> 46:48.419
Come on.

46:48.421 --> 46:50.654
Take this off.

46:50.656 --> 46:53.424
Just leave her like this, yeah, JD.

47:00.566 --> 47:01.868
JD?

47:06.638 --> 47:09.073
- Shh.
- Oh, my Lord.

47:09.075 --> 47:11.207
One of them went upstairs.

47:11.209 --> 47:12.509
Oh.

47:12.511 --> 47:14.614
I think we can get out that way.

47:16.316 --> 47:18.415
Okay.

47:27.627 --> 47:31.194
What was that?

47:31.196 --> 47:32.799
JD?

47:37.403 --> 47:39.669
What?

47:39.671 --> 47:44.642
Come on, come on. Come on. Come on.

47:44.644 --> 47:47.846
- Aw, fuck.
- Shh.

47:49.281 --> 47:51.284
That's the only way out?

47:54.053 --> 47:55.486
- Oh, my.
- Fuck!

47:55.488 --> 47:57.224
Shh!

48:18.510 --> 48:20.778
Do you like to... You wanna play fun?

48:20.780 --> 48:22.782
Are you better?

48:24.517 --> 48:26.316
There's no one upstairs or outside.

48:26.318 --> 48:29.720
I didn't see anyone down here.

48:29.722 --> 48:32.926
- I think they're here.
- Let's just...

48:37.229 --> 48:39.265
Do it quickly, okay? Quickly.

48:55.080 --> 48:57.750
What's that knife for?

48:59.419 --> 49:01.288
Oh.

49:07.359 --> 49:10.529
We're ready, man, please.

49:22.542 --> 49:23.774
Oh!

49:23.776 --> 49:25.645
Hey, look.

49:29.214 --> 49:30.783
Yeah.

50:02.548 --> 50:04.115
Hey!

50:04.117 --> 50:07.487
- Fuck.
- She is wasted.

50:08.687 --> 50:10.187
Who the fuck are you?

50:10.189 --> 50:11.991
Better get back, I'll fuck her.

50:14.127 --> 50:16.359
You assholes should try for another time

50:16.361 --> 50:17.828
when she's not wasted.

50:17.830 --> 50:20.263
We'll take her with us.
We can take her home.

50:20.265 --> 50:21.499
- That's right.
- No.

50:26.372 --> 50:28.839
Lucy. Everybody, no, let's
just... let's just relax.

50:28.841 --> 50:30.508
This is not what it looks like.

50:30.510 --> 50:31.875
Everybody just... Just chill out.

50:31.877 --> 50:34.578
Just chill out, and
let's talk this through.

50:34.580 --> 50:36.647
Okay, then give us the knife.

50:36.649 --> 50:37.881
Put down the knife!

50:37.883 --> 50:39.482
- Okay.
- Give it to me.

50:39.484 --> 50:40.817
- Okay.
- Give it... Just give it...

50:40.819 --> 50:42.852
Wait... close enough.

50:42.854 --> 50:44.754
Okay, pick her up.

50:44.756 --> 50:46.756
No, no, no, you can't take her.

50:46.758 --> 50:49.225
Once... once it's started, you
can't stop until it's finished.

50:49.227 --> 50:51.529
No, don't... You... Roosevelt!

50:56.502 --> 50:58.502
Roosevelt! Roosevelt!

50:58.504 --> 51:01.541
Hey, hey! Okay, okay.

51:05.544 --> 51:07.147
Lucy.

51:11.816 --> 51:15.421
Please don't do that.
You'll bring it on yourself.

51:19.325 --> 51:20.827
Oh!

51:24.229 --> 51:27.631
Oh!

51:27.633 --> 51:29.866
- Miss?
- Is she alive?

51:29.868 --> 51:32.203
Her feet go down to death.

51:32.205 --> 51:34.641
The steps lead right to the grave.

51:37.410 --> 51:39.375
Can you sit up?

51:39.377 --> 51:41.781
- Here, let's...
- What?

51:43.783 --> 51:45.381
Oh, my God.

51:45.383 --> 51:47.186
Oh, oh, oh.

51:52.925 --> 51:55.359
Her feet go down to death.

51:55.361 --> 51:58.328
Her steps lead straight to the grave.

51:58.330 --> 52:00.598
Her feet go down to death.

52:00.600 --> 52:02.902
Her steps lead straight to the grave.

52:08.441 --> 52:10.976
Come on!

52:12.877 --> 52:14.011
Whoa, whoa.

52:14.013 --> 52:15.779
It's okay, I can walk,

52:15.781 --> 52:17.714
are you sure?

52:17.716 --> 52:19.886
Come on!

52:28.760 --> 52:31.694
- Are you okay?
- I think so.

52:31.696 --> 52:33.665
What's your name?

52:35.301 --> 52:37.003
Laura.

52:38.771 --> 52:42.406
Oh, it is not as bad as
I thought it was gonna be.

52:42.408 --> 52:45.676
- Thank God.
- We need to get you home.

52:45.678 --> 52:47.810
- We need you to...
- I don't understand.

52:47.812 --> 52:51.348
The last thing I remember
is at the dentist.

52:51.350 --> 52:53.750
Hey, are you okay?

52:53.752 --> 52:55.886
Fuck! Okay, come on!

52:55.888 --> 52:58.758
Jess, they're looking for us!

53:02.461 --> 53:03.963
This way.

53:10.635 --> 53:12.803
Where are we going?

53:12.805 --> 53:14.404
JD!

53:14.406 --> 53:17.076
- Come on, get down!
- Oh, where are you?

53:23.848 --> 53:26.219
- Watch out!
- Hey, are you okay?

53:27.852 --> 53:29.053
Where's Laura?

53:29.055 --> 53:31.090
Laura.

53:48.941 --> 53:51.177
This way.

54:05.591 --> 54:07.890
Shh.

54:07.892 --> 54:11.163
Guys, I don't even know
what's going on right now.

54:14.633 --> 54:17.070
Laura, are you still doing okay?

54:22.975 --> 54:26.713
My dress is getting dirty and I'm cold.

54:28.381 --> 54:33.119
- We need to get you home.
- Okay.

54:42.894 --> 54:45.395
Was that, like, a black magic ritual

54:45.397 --> 54:47.634
or something we interrupted?

54:49.100 --> 54:52.569
I was having a séance for Sam.

54:52.571 --> 54:55.872
I just wanted to talk to him.

54:55.874 --> 55:01.444
I didn't really think that
people did rituals anymore.

55:01.446 --> 55:03.080
What about prom?

55:03.082 --> 55:05.385
You don't think prom is a ritual?

55:06.986 --> 55:12.555
Yeah, with king, and queens,
and crowns, and tiaras.

55:12.557 --> 55:14.326
Go this way.

55:22.901 --> 55:25.103
Fuck.

55:25.805 --> 55:27.706
What is this place?

55:30.810 --> 55:33.246
I wanna start a fire.

55:35.680 --> 55:39.349
I'm sorry about Sam, Laila.

55:47.493 --> 55:49.660
Hey, where's Laura?

55:49.662 --> 55:51.464
Who's Laura?

56:03.107 --> 56:04.409
Whoo!

56:06.745 --> 56:10.080
- Laila, get in here!
- Coming.

56:10.082 --> 56:12.784
Whoo! Laila!

56:19.658 --> 56:22.028
- Ah!
- Come on!

56:28.267 --> 56:30.168
Whoo!

56:30.870 --> 56:33.270
- Whoo hoo!
- Whoo!

56:33.272 --> 56:36.843
So Laila told you... About Sam?

56:41.113 --> 56:42.882
Yeah.

56:46.051 --> 56:48.821
He joined the military to pay for school.

56:52.591 --> 56:54.827
And for what?

56:57.763 --> 57:00.196
It's pointless.

57:00.198 --> 57:04.169
All of it. It's so pointless.

57:16.314 --> 57:18.484
Come here.

57:19.285 --> 57:21.154
Whoo!

57:29.627 --> 57:31.263
So...

57:33.631 --> 57:35.031
Speaking of prom...

57:35.033 --> 57:36.700
Mm-hmm.

57:36.702 --> 57:38.571
You went stag?

57:44.109 --> 57:47.977
No, I didn't.

57:47.979 --> 57:50.613
- Oh.
- No, no, no.

57:50.615 --> 57:54.017
My date... my date totally blew it and, um,

57:54.019 --> 57:56.185
he kind of broke my heart, actually.

57:56.187 --> 57:58.955
I'm sorry.

57:58.957 --> 58:00.893
I'm not.

58:07.765 --> 58:10.002
I'm really glad I met you.

58:13.305 --> 58:15.308
Me too.

58:57.281 --> 59:00.750
Come on! Whoo!

59:00.752 --> 59:02.255
Whoo! Whoo!

59:08.359 --> 59:13.196
- Laila!
- I'm sorry. Did I ruin a moment?

59:13.198 --> 59:15.399
Get your asses in here!

59:16.968 --> 59:19.604
Get in here!

59:25.910 --> 59:28.310
You coming in?

01:00:53.031 --> 01:00:55.067
Lucy.

01:01:00.339 --> 01:01:02.775
Lucy.

01:01:11.316 --> 01:01:13.552
Make a choice.

01:01:42.046 --> 01:01:44.413
Oh!

01:01:44.415 --> 01:01:48.119
- Who are you?
- So you want to get out?

01:01:50.955 --> 01:01:54.156
- Answer my riddle.
- A riddle?

01:01:54.158 --> 01:01:58.028
Answer it and you'll get back.

01:01:58.030 --> 01:02:02.899
What has no beginning, end, or middle?

01:02:02.901 --> 01:02:04.837
What has no be...

01:02:06.604 --> 01:02:08.971
I have a...

01:02:08.973 --> 01:02:11.473
Hey, baby, I totally blacked out.

01:02:11.475 --> 01:02:12.875
You're sexy.

01:02:12.877 --> 01:02:14.444
Stop. Stop!

01:02:14.446 --> 01:02:16.613
Stop!

01:02:16.615 --> 01:02:20.316
What has no beginning, end, or middle?

01:02:20.318 --> 01:02:22.519
- Time?
- No!

01:02:22.521 --> 01:02:25.357
- The universe.
- No.

01:02:31.095 --> 01:02:34.029
I forgot.

01:02:34.031 --> 01:02:36.601
I made a wish at prom.

01:02:38.303 --> 01:02:39.871
A wish?

01:02:41.573 --> 01:02:44.610
That something real would
happen to me for once.

01:02:47.412 --> 01:02:51.117
What has no beginning, end, or middle?

01:02:52.618 --> 01:02:54.820
I don't know. I don't know.

01:03:02.227 --> 01:03:04.026
A donut?

01:03:12.069 --> 01:03:14.139
I can see it.

01:03:21.479 --> 01:03:26.283
What if, when you die,
you realize that life

01:03:26.285 --> 01:03:29.822
is just one big dream?

01:03:30.923 --> 01:03:34.124
How would you do things differently?

01:03:34.126 --> 01:03:35.661
Luce...

01:03:38.696 --> 01:03:40.899
I lost you.

01:03:41.633 --> 01:03:44.170
Do you wanna come back up?

01:03:59.318 --> 01:04:01.886
I feel really free with you.

01:04:13.332 --> 01:04:16.668
This has been the
craziest night of my life.

01:04:17.568 --> 01:04:20.572
I know. Doesn't even seem real.

01:04:21.573 --> 01:04:24.310
It's cause it isn't real.

01:04:36.021 --> 01:04:37.620
Um, right in this moment,

01:04:37.622 --> 01:04:40.156
right now...

01:04:40.158 --> 01:04:44.160
I have a really strong
feeling about something.

01:04:44.162 --> 01:04:47.632
Yeah? What is that?

01:04:50.702 --> 01:04:54.437
I want my first time to be with you.

01:04:54.439 --> 01:04:55.941
What?

01:05:08.153 --> 01:05:11.290
- Are you really sure?
- Yeah.

01:05:23.368 --> 01:05:26.905
You know we don't have to rush anything.

01:05:28.506 --> 01:05:31.542
I know. I want to.

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:52.095
- I really like you.
- I really like you, too.

01:06:23.528 --> 01:06:25.898
I think I just had a vision.

01:06:26.731 --> 01:06:29.335
We'll have to compare notes.

01:07:40.705 --> 01:07:42.840
Hi.

01:08:40.930 --> 01:08:45.102
All my life I think I've
wanted to live a happy ending...

01:08:50.307 --> 01:08:53.611
...to walk off into the sunset.

01:08:57.481 --> 01:09:02.620
Funny thing is, there's
a sunrise in every minute.

01:09:04.287 --> 01:09:07.624
Wow.

01:09:07.626 --> 01:09:12.027
This whole time I thought we
were way deep in the woods.

01:09:12.029 --> 01:09:16.667
Well, we were in a way, I guess.

01:09:20.270 --> 01:09:23.037
And there are no endings,

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:27.044
because time does not stand still.

01:10:01.745 --> 01:10:03.581
So...

01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:06.685
Can I get your number?

01:10:07.388 --> 01:10:12.388
