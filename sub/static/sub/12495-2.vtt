00:13.931 --> 00:15.975
I'm Henry Hart.

00:13.931 --> 00:15.975
Here about the job.

00:16.016 --> 00:17.392
You're gonna blow a bubble?

00:17.434 --> 00:18.811
I'm gonna blow your mind.

00:22.230 --> 00:23.607
You're Captain Man.

00:23.649 --> 00:24.900
That's right, Henry.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.987
You want to be my sidekick?

00:29.404 --> 00:30.781
(grunting)

00:30.823 --> 00:32.741
Who's the freak

00:30.823 --> 00:32.741
in the diaper?

00:32.783 --> 00:35.452
The Toddler.

00:32.783 --> 00:35.452

00:44.211 --> 00:46.213
get a discount here?

00:47.840 --> 00:49.424
That plant

00:47.840 --> 00:49.424
just shook its head.

00:49.466 --> 00:51.050
How much for the plant?

00:51.092 --> 00:53.846
Ahhhhh!

00:51.092 --> 00:53.846
It spit in my eye!

00:53.888 --> 00:56.264
Uh-oh.

00:53.888 --> 00:56.264
What's up, Gooch?

00:56.306 --> 00:58.559

01:19.621 --> 01:21.122
Interesting.

01:24.043 --> 01:29.088
Okay, George has six times

01:24.043 --> 01:29.088
as many dimes as quarters

01:24.043 --> 01:29.088

01:29.130 --> 01:31.550
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

01:31.967 --> 01:35.054
I got two responses.

My birthday party

01:36.638 --> 01:39.098
they might come.

01:40.099 --> 01:41.142
Who?

01:41.435 --> 01:43.311
Sidney Burnbaum

01:41.435 --> 01:43.311
and Oliver Pook.

01:43.353 --> 01:45.731
Ugh.

01:53.906 --> 01:55.824

01:55.866 --> 01:57.451
Wait. What app?

01:57.492 --> 01:59.661
Hey, you never told us

01:57.492 --> 01:59.661

07:13.225 --> 07:15.185
<i>I'm fluffy!</i>

07:15.227 --> 07:18.063
And you're worried

07:15.227 --> 07:18.063
about a party?

07:18.105 --> 07:20.648
But-- But Jasper's

07:18.105 --> 07:20.648
been my best friend

07:20.690 --> 07:21.983
since we were five.

07:23.277 --> 07:25.362
Okay. Okay. It's cool.

07:25.404 --> 07:27.030
Uh, you go to Jasper's party.

07:27.072 --> 07:28.323
I'll handle The Toddler

07:27.072 --> 07:28.323
by myself.

07:28.365 --> 07:29.490
Don't worry about it.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.534
Are you sure?

07:31.910 --> 07:34.162
Yeah, I've battled

07:31.910 --> 07:34.162
the Toddler alone before.

07:34.204 --> 07:35.747
Almost killed me,

07:34.204 --> 07:35.747
but whatever.

07:36.748 --> 07:38.292
Now I feel all bad.

07:38.333 --> 07:40.627
(chuckles)

07:38.333 --> 07:40.627
Don't feel bad.

07:41.086 --> 07:42.254
I'll save the world.

07:42.296 --> 07:43.755
You go have a fun time

07:43.797 --> 07:45.173
at Jasper's birthday party.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.134
Dance.

07:47.175 --> 07:48.302
Drink some fruity punch.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.221
Leilani,

07:49.177 --> 07:51.221
turn on the hot tub.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.474
(Leilani)

07:52.139 --> 07:54.474
Yay. (laughs)

07:59.354 --> 08:01.273
(Jasper)

07:59.354 --> 08:01.273
<i>You're supposed</i>

07:59.354 --> 08:01.273
<i>to be here.</i>

08:01.315 --> 08:04.151
Okay.

08:01.315 --> 08:04.151
Yeah, Jasper.

08:04.943 --> 08:06.694
Jasper, I'm on my way.

08:06.736 --> 08:08.363
<i>You got the muffins?</i>

08:06.736 --> 08:08.363
No.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.115
I'm not bringing the muffins.

08:10.865 --> 08:14.035
<i>Wait. Did you hear</i>

08:10.865 --> 08:14.035
<i>what happened to Captain Man?</i>

08:14.077 --> 08:16.455
What about Captain Man?

08:14.077 --> 08:16.455
<i>He got captured.</i>

08:16.496 --> 08:18.039
What?

08:18.081 --> 08:20.500
<i>Henry, am I handsome?</i>

08:20.541 --> 08:22.627
<i>While reports are unclear,</i>

08:22.669 --> 08:26.631
<i>we do have confirmation that</i>

08:22.669 --> 08:26.631
<i>Captain Man has been captured,</i>

08:26.673 --> 08:29.050
<i>and is being held</i>

08:26.673 --> 08:29.050
<i>at a secret location.</i>

08:29.092 --> 08:31.219
Captured? Dang it, Ray!

08:31.261 --> 08:34.097
<i>Next,</i>

08:31.261 --> 08:34.097
<i>why squirrels love nuts.</i>

08:35.682 --> 08:37.809
(Jasper)

08:35.682 --> 08:37.809
<i>Henry? Henry?</i>

08:37.851 --> 08:40.312
Uh, I can't talk.

08:37.851 --> 08:40.312
I'm naked.

08:40.354 --> 08:43.648
♪♪

08:49.779 --> 08:51.990
<i>♪ This is the moment ♪</i>

08:52.032 --> 08:56.161
♪<i> This is the moment</i>

08:52.032 --> 08:56.161
<i>that changes it all ♪</i>

08:56.203 --> 08:58.372
You said there'd be ladies.

08:59.122 --> 09:00.832
They'll be here.

09:02.501 --> 09:04.752
Hey,

09:02.501 --> 09:04.752
you guys like my shirt?

09:04.794 --> 09:07.881
It was a birthday present

09:04.794 --> 09:07.881
from my aunt.

09:07.922 --> 09:09.549
It's okay.

09:09.590 --> 09:11.426
It would look better

09:09.590 --> 09:11.426
if you wore Boinks.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.303
What are Boinks?

09:13.345 --> 09:14.846
Check this.

09:17.307 --> 09:18.850
They really firm your trunk.

09:20.101 --> 09:21.895
Do they?

09:20.101 --> 09:21.895
Heck yeah!

09:21.936 --> 09:23.230
Slap my gut.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.399
Ehh--

09:26.400 --> 09:28.402
Yeah.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.240
Me next.

09:35.992 --> 09:37.536
Wow, firm.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.251
Wow.

09:45.544 --> 09:46.961
Cool party.

09:49.339 --> 09:50.798
Where's Henry?

09:53.634 --> 09:55.970
(gasping sounds)

09:59.974 --> 10:05.688
Nyah, nyah, nyah,

09:59.974 --> 10:05.688
nyah, nyah, nyah.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.441
Come on, Toddler.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.359
Let me out of this thing

10:07.482 --> 10:09.359
before I puke.

10:09.401 --> 10:10.818
(Toddler) No.

10:11.152 --> 10:15.449
This is my playroom,

10:11.152 --> 10:15.449
my toys, my rules.

10:16.741 --> 10:19.286
You sick

10:16.741 --> 10:19.286
underdeveloped maniac.

10:21.037 --> 10:23.248
Ow! Geez, man.

10:23.290 --> 10:27.668
Oh, I thought

10:23.290 --> 10:27.668
the famous Captain Man

10:23.290 --> 10:27.668
couldn't be injured.

10:27.710 --> 10:30.130
He can't,

10:27.710 --> 10:30.130
but he does feel pain.

10:30.171 --> 10:32.507
You're not allowed to talk

10:30.171 --> 10:32.507
unless you raise your hand

10:30.171 --> 10:32.507
and I call on you!

10:34.301 --> 10:36.428
You stupid head.

10:40.557 --> 10:42.517
(electronic sputtering)

10:48.356 --> 10:50.650
(Toddler)

10:48.356 --> 10:50.650
That's what you get.

10:50.691 --> 10:52.360
(Captain Man)

10:50.691 --> 10:52.360
Come on, Toddler.

10:52.402 --> 10:54.070
Your insane plan won't work.

10:54.112 --> 10:55.822
(cell phone rings)

10:55.863 --> 10:57.282
(Toddler)

10:55.863 --> 10:57.282
A lot you know.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.242
What?

10:57.324 --> 10:59.242
You're late.

10:59.284 --> 11:01.995
Well, sorry, but I'm kind of

10:59.284 --> 11:01.995
in the middle of something.

11:02.870 --> 11:04.914
Something more important

11:02.870 --> 11:04.914
than my birthday party?

11:04.956 --> 11:06.040
Uh--

11:06.082 --> 11:08.126
48 hours from now

11:08.168 --> 11:12.589
every baby in Swellview

11:08.168 --> 11:12.589
will be a hideous monster.

11:13.214 --> 11:15.258
Yeah, this is

11:13.214 --> 11:15.258
pretty important.

11:15.300 --> 11:17.260
But you promised me that--

11:17.302 --> 11:19.762
Henry,

11:17.302 --> 11:19.762
will you get your butt

11:17.302 --> 11:19.762
to this party?

11:19.804 --> 11:22.307
'Cause so far

11:19.804 --> 11:22.307
it's just me, Jasper,

11:22.349 --> 11:24.809
and two dorks

11:22.349 --> 11:24.809
that keep slapping

11:22.349 --> 11:24.809
each other's Boinks.

11:25.268 --> 11:27.395
(both laughing)

11:27.437 --> 11:28.438
I gotta go.

11:28.896 --> 11:29.814
Henry.

11:30.565 --> 11:31.941
(Captain Man)

11:30.565 --> 11:31.941
Come on, Toddler.

11:31.983 --> 11:33.860
Let me down from this thing.

11:33.901 --> 11:36.571
(groans) It's squeezing me

11:33.901 --> 11:36.571
in bad ways.

11:36.613 --> 11:37.989
No!

11:38.031 --> 11:40.158
And now, Captain Man,

11:40.200 --> 11:42.994
I have thousands of babies

11:40.200 --> 11:42.994
to monsterize.

11:43.036 --> 11:46.456
And to make sure that

11:43.036 --> 11:46.456
you don't try to stop me,

11:46.498 --> 11:49.334
I will now destroy you.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.753
You idiot.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.753
I can't be destroyed.

11:52.795 --> 11:56.924
I know that!

11:52.795 --> 11:56.924
But you can be dropped...

11:57.716 --> 11:59.177
(screams)

11:59.219 --> 12:02.639
...into my bottomless

11:59.219 --> 12:02.639
ball pit.

12:02.681 --> 12:05.016
Tod-- Tod-- Todd--

12:02.681 --> 12:05.016
Toddler?

12:05.808 --> 12:08.269
Playtime is over,

12:05.808 --> 12:08.269
Captain Man.

12:08.311 --> 12:10.855
(evil laughter)

12:10.897 --> 12:12.731
(ice cream truck song plays)

12:12.773 --> 12:15.443
Wait. Listen. (gasps)

12:15.485 --> 12:17.278
It's the ice cream man.

12:17.320 --> 12:20.073
Yay! Woo-hoo!

12:21.157 --> 12:23.577
I'll destroy you

12:21.157 --> 12:23.577
in a minute.

12:24.952 --> 12:27.414
Come on, fellas,

12:24.952 --> 12:27.414
ice cream man.

12:27.455 --> 12:29.832
I hope they have

12:27.455 --> 12:29.832
mint chocolate chip.

12:31.459 --> 12:33.628
Come on! (grunts)

12:36.423 --> 12:37.549
Captain Man.

12:37.591 --> 12:38.757
Henry!

12:38.799 --> 12:40.594
It's Kid Danger.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.680
Now quick, how do I

12:41.720 --> 12:43.680
get you down from there?

12:43.722 --> 12:46.391
I don't know.

12:43.722 --> 12:46.391
This is the first time

12:46.433 --> 12:48.560
I've been trapped

12:46.433 --> 12:48.560
in a baby bouncer

12:46.433 --> 12:48.560
over a bottomless ball pit.

12:49.477 --> 12:50.562
Try that lever.

12:50.604 --> 12:51.730
(Henry) Right.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.651
There was no

12:53.940 --> 12:56.651
ice cream truck.

12:57.818 --> 12:59.362
Who tricked me?

12:59.404 --> 13:02.657
And who's that boy

12:59.404 --> 13:02.657
near my lever?

13:02.699 --> 13:05.159
That's my sidekick,

13:02.699 --> 13:05.159
kid Danger.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.954
I didn't know

13:05.910 --> 13:07.954
you had a sidekick.

13:07.995 --> 13:09.497
Why don't I have a sidekick?

13:09.539 --> 13:11.040
I want a sidekick!

13:11.874 --> 13:13.084
You have us.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.628
Shut up. You're dumb.

13:14.669 --> 13:17.505
Uh, Kid Danger?

13:14.669 --> 13:17.505
Yeah?

13:17.547 --> 13:19.424
Why don't you pull

13:17.547 --> 13:19.424
that lever?

13:19.466 --> 13:22.385
Oh, right.

13:19.466 --> 13:22.385
No!

13:22.427 --> 13:24.763
Whoa!

13:26.264 --> 13:27.806
Squish the boy.

13:28.516 --> 13:29.976
Get him! Get him!

13:30.017 --> 13:31.728
(Captain Man)

13:30.017 --> 13:31.728
Kid Danger, look out!

13:33.271 --> 13:35.022
(sputtering)

13:33.271 --> 13:35.022
Aaaah!

13:37.525 --> 13:40.612
Oh, my God, he's got my thing

13:37.525 --> 13:40.612
that goes sspppfft!

13:43.281 --> 13:45.158
Get him! Get him!

13:45.199 --> 13:46.867
Where's Henry?

13:46.909 --> 13:48.369
I don't know,

13:48.411 --> 13:51.038
but I bet he's having

13:48.411 --> 13:51.038
more fun than we are.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.123
Hello?

13:52.165 --> 13:53.416
Hello?

13:53.458 --> 13:55.084
Hello?

13:56.377 --> 13:57.629
(Captain Man)

13:56.377 --> 13:57.629
Use the truck.

13:57.671 --> 13:59.297
Come here.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.508
Hey, I hate you!

14:04.093 --> 14:06.387
There, you've been kicked.

14:04.093 --> 14:06.387
(groans)

14:06.429 --> 14:07.764
(Henry)

14:06.429 --> 14:07.764
Cut the bands!

14:11.476 --> 14:13.019
Look at you.

14:13.060 --> 14:15.772
Get him, kid.

14:13.060 --> 14:15.772
(grunting)

14:15.814 --> 14:18.107
Give me back

14:15.814 --> 14:18.107
my spit pistol.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.697
(dance music playing)

14:32.747 --> 14:33.956
(grunts)

14:33.998 --> 14:36.042
Go on, get him!

14:39.671 --> 14:42.716
You guys are seriously

14:39.671 --> 14:42.716
the worst henchmen ever.

14:49.347 --> 14:50.348
Kid Danger!

14:57.438 --> 15:01.067
You boys think

14:57.438 --> 15:01.067
you're so spiffy.

15:01.776 --> 15:04.904
Well, have a look

15:01.776 --> 15:04.904
at my bang bottle.

15:06.197 --> 15:08.157
Bang bottle?

15:06.197 --> 15:08.157
That's right,

15:08.199 --> 15:11.244
and it's filled

15:08.199 --> 15:11.244
with explodey-juice.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.288
Kid Danger,

15:12.579 --> 15:14.288
get out of here.

15:14.330 --> 15:15.915
I'm not leaving

15:14.330 --> 15:15.915
without you.

15:15.956 --> 15:17.709
But that nipple is flashing.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.919
No one leaves.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.337
(shouts)

15:22.088 --> 15:23.464
(shouts)

15:22.088 --> 15:23.464
(beeps)

15:25.091 --> 15:29.429
Now, we're all gonna

15:25.091 --> 15:29.429
go boom together.

15:29.470 --> 15:30.930
What do we do?

15:30.971 --> 15:32.766
Push me that way.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.769
(slowed audio)

15:34.058 --> 15:35.769
No! No!

15:39.856 --> 15:41.900
Help me! Get me out!

15:41.941 --> 15:45.403
Ugh, these balls

15:41.941 --> 15:45.403
smell like feet and pee.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.198
Oh, this is it for me.

15:49.240 --> 15:52.577
I've been hoisted

15:49.240 --> 15:52.577
by my own petard.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.832
(both exhale)

15:57.874 --> 16:00.167
The bang bottle!

15:57.874 --> 16:00.167
Oh, man!

16:02.128 --> 16:03.296
What do we do with this?

16:05.089 --> 16:07.174
We give the baby his bottle.

16:08.134 --> 16:09.928
Oh, good call.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.679
Hey.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.679
What's up?

16:11.721 --> 16:13.681
Hurry.

16:11.721 --> 16:13.681
Oh, right.

16:18.770 --> 16:20.062
Kid Danger!

16:21.188 --> 16:22.982
(rapid beeping)

16:23.566 --> 16:26.026
(The Toddler screams)

16:36.329 --> 16:38.164
Nice work, Kid Danger.

16:38.205 --> 16:39.666
You got skills.

16:40.917 --> 16:42.502
Thanks, Captain Man.

16:42.543 --> 16:43.920
(cell phone beeps)

16:45.129 --> 16:46.673
Jasper!

16:45.129 --> 16:46.673
Oh, yeah,

16:46.714 --> 16:48.758
you'd better get

16:46.714 --> 16:48.758
to that birthday party.

16:46.714 --> 16:48.758
Right.

16:50.760 --> 16:55.556
Uh, Ray, will you do me

16:50.760 --> 16:55.556
a huge favor?

16:58.267 --> 17:00.770
(grunting)

17:02.229 --> 17:03.606
(barking)

17:03.940 --> 17:07.652
They've been doing that

17:03.940 --> 17:07.652
for two hours.

17:08.987 --> 17:11.155
My party's a flop.

17:11.197 --> 17:13.867
I'm just gonna go upstairs

17:13.908 --> 17:16.494
and sit in my closet

17:13.908 --> 17:16.494
with my cat.

17:18.663 --> 17:20.164
Pardon me...

17:26.963 --> 17:31.384
My man van broke down

17:26.963 --> 17:31.384
out there in the street,

17:31.425 --> 17:33.553
so I walked into this house

17:33.594 --> 17:36.180
and came down

17:33.594 --> 17:36.180
to this basement.

17:36.222 --> 17:38.349
Holy chunks, you're--

17:38.391 --> 17:40.100
You're Captain Man!

17:40.142 --> 17:41.769
Thank you.

17:41.811 --> 17:44.188
You're my hero.

17:41.811 --> 17:44.188
Of course.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.481
Mine too.

17:45.523 --> 17:47.191
Um, I'm Charlotte.

17:47.233 --> 17:50.611
Hi, Mr. Cap--

17:47.233 --> 17:50.611
Mapton Can.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.781
I mean-- (laughs)

17:54.782 --> 17:56.743
That's enough.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.743
I'm so sorry.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.580
And, um, I'm Henry.

18:01.664 --> 18:03.290
Nice to meet you, Henry.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.835
Hey, Captain Man?

18:05.877 --> 18:07.545
Yes, a question.

18:07.587 --> 18:10.006
Can I hit you in the head

18:07.587 --> 18:10.006
with a baseball bat?

18:10.048 --> 18:11.883
Dude.

18:10.048 --> 18:11.883
Jasper!

18:11.925 --> 18:14.468
No, no, it's okay.

18:14.510 --> 18:16.054
But remember, kids,

18:16.095 --> 18:17.847
never do this to anyone

18:16.095 --> 18:17.847
but Captain Man,

18:17.889 --> 18:20.224
because regular people

18:17.889 --> 18:20.224
could be badly injured.

18:20.266 --> 18:21.726
(screams)

18:23.728 --> 18:25.521
Wow!

18:25.563 --> 18:27.231
I wasn't done talking.

18:29.233 --> 18:30.026
Did that hurt?

18:30.068 --> 18:33.029
Yeah, but I'm okay.

18:38.034 --> 18:40.202
Well, I should call

18:38.034 --> 18:40.202
a tow truck

18:40.244 --> 18:42.204
to come pick up my man van.

18:42.246 --> 18:45.207
Or, it's my best friend

18:42.246 --> 18:45.207
Jasper's birthday party.

18:45.249 --> 18:46.751
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, it is.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.169
You can stay and party

18:46.793 --> 18:49.169
with us if you wanna.

18:49.211 --> 18:50.546
Will there be soup?

18:50.588 --> 18:52.090
I'll open a can.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.133
Then I'd love to stay

18:52.131 --> 18:54.133
and party with you guys.

18:54.592 --> 18:57.344
(both screaming)

18:59.055 --> 19:00.848
Uh, Captain Man.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.100
Yes, boy.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.893
Would it be cool if Jasper

19:03.935 --> 19:05.645
texted a few friends

19:03.935 --> 19:05.645
from school

19:05.686 --> 19:06.938
and told them you're here

19:05.686 --> 19:06.938
at his party?

19:06.980 --> 19:08.982
Yeah, can I?

19:09.023 --> 19:11.358
Sure, I love being used.

19:12.610 --> 19:13.778
Yay.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.154
Wow, thanks!

19:15.195 --> 19:16.781

19:15.195 --> 19:16.781
