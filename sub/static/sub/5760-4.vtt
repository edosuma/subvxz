00:07.980 --> 00:09.520
My name is melinda gordon.

00:12.160 --> 00:12.970
I just got married,

00:13.280 --> 00:14.640
just moved to a small town,

00:14.820 --> 00:16.690
just opened up an antiques shop.

00:17.030 --> 00:18.910
I might be just like you...

00:19.860 --> 00:21.580
except from the time that I was a little girl,

00:21.830 --> 00:24.180
I knew that I could talk to the dead.

00:25.160 --> 00:26.130
It's all right,honey.

00:26.240 --> 00:28.140
"Earthbound spirits," my grandmother called them,

00:28.690 --> 00:30.020
the ones who have not crossed over yet

00:30.130 --> 00:32.090
because they have unfinished business with the living,

00:32.350 --> 00:34.350
and they come to me for help.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.440
To tell you my story,

00:36.810 --> 00:39.030
I have to tell you theirs.

01:33.250 --> 01:34.810
I'm so sorry.

01:36.550 --> 01:37.620
What are you doing?

01:38.430 --> 01:40.330
I just can't do this anymore.

01:43.470 --> 01:45.220
No. No!

01:45.500 --> 01:47.060
Stop! Don't!

01:47.120 --> 01:51.610
You guys,honestly,it's getting so old. I'm serious.

01:54.530 --> 02:00.030
Gwen,please! Gwen,please!Think about what are you doing.

02:01.540 --> 02:03.500
Part like throuth,Gwen please,

02:07.130 --> 02:08.930
Gwen stop it!

02:09.710 --> 02:11.510
Don't!This isn't right

02:13.600 --> 02:15.300
Please stop it!

02:16.530 --> 02:18.900
I swear I could hear someone yelling up there.

02:20.230 --> 02:23.260
I'm telling you,sometimes I think the walls in thisbuilding are made of tracing paper.

02:28.530 --> 02:29.340
Ooh!

02:31.130 --> 02:32.300
We gotta get up there.

02:41.530 --> 02:43.960
She lives alone. I haven't seen her all day. Hello?

02:44.950 --> 02:46.280
Can you hear me? Hello!

02:46.530 --> 02:50.270
Break it down. Break it down.

02:57.250 --> 02:58.000
Oh,my god!

02:59.180 --> 03:00.570
she took pills.

03:01.270 --> 03:01.770
What kind?

03:01.790 --> 03:04.300
A lot of aticar,proxytin,others,I think.

03:04.310 --> 03:07.110
Jim,she took pills-- aticar,proxytin,maybe more.

03:07.530 --> 03:09.280
--Call 9-1-1.
--Ok,ok.

03:09.950 --> 03:11.830
Ma'am? Ma'am?

03:12.700 --> 03:14.240
Hi. I have a woman,

03:14.550 --> 03:15.710
and she's unconscious.

03:16.030 --> 03:17.440
259 west main street.

03:17.610 --> 03:19.170
I'm not getting a pulse. Tell them that.

03:19.250 --> 03:20.650
He says she doesn't have a pulse.

03:20.740 --> 03:22.140
He's doing cpr.

03:26.580 --> 03:27.580
I'm losin' her.

03:29.960 --> 03:34.240
no. Gwen,not like this. It isn't right.

03:34.920 --> 03:36.880
I just wanted to be with you.

03:37.540 --> 03:39.320
Take me with you.

05:06.600 --> 05:07.400
You can see me!

05:07.890 --> 05:10.070
Not,no.Go away.

05:10.250 --> 05:11.610
I'm looking for my doctor.

05:11.930 --> 05:13.480
Where is he?

05:13.710 --> 05:14.560
I'm sure he's here.

05:15.110 --> 05:16.650
--Go away. 
--Tall.

05:18.740 --> 05:21.460
You know what? It's really not a good time.

05:23.910 --> 05:25.740
Hey,we got her stabilized.

05:26.130 --> 05:27.860
She should be all right.

05:30.030 --> 05:31.060
What's gonna happen to her?

05:31.690 --> 05:33.730
Well,all they can do is hold her for a few days.

05:33.860 --> 05:35.810
The hospital psych team will evaluate her.

05:35.980 --> 05:38.780
If they feel like she's not a threat to herself of anybody else

05:39.020 --> 05:40.490
they gotta let her go.

05:40.620 --> 05:41.660
Let's get out of here.

05:41.820 --> 05:45.640
You know what? Why don't you guys go ahead,and I'll catch up.

05:46.450 --> 05:48.250
All right.

05:54.580 --> 05:57.920
How come you're the only one who can see me?

05:59.560 --> 06:03.400
I've been asking myself that question for years.

06:03.920 --> 06:05.720
Who are you?

06:05.850 --> 06:08.100
I'm conor donovan.

06:09.640 --> 06:11.940
Um...I'm her fiance.

06:11.960 --> 06:13.720
You mean were her fiance.

06:13.880 --> 06:16.700
Semantics.

06:17.190 --> 06:19.000
Has she tried this before?

06:19.130 --> 06:20.410
No.

06:20.590 --> 06:23.300
Well,she's been depressed since...

06:23.560 --> 06:26.220
since I left.

06:26.370 --> 06:29.300
--Can I ask how.. 
--how I left?

06:30.840 --> 06:33.700
It was,um,a year ago.

06:33.810 --> 06:36.210
My third triathlon.

06:36.340 --> 06:38.480
I was kicking ass--

06:38.590 --> 06:41.460
a 2 1/2 mile swim,a 112-mile bike.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.720
I was just getting ready to start the 26-mile run.

06:44.830 --> 06:48.010
I was heading for my best time ever.

06:48.140 --> 06:52.400
Nothing was gonna stop me. Nothing...

06:58.550 --> 07:02.700
except a little kid on a speedster 8500.

07:08.160 --> 07:11.240
I remember thinking how much I envied that kid.

07:11.400 --> 07:14.090
My father gave me that same bike when I was about his age,

07:14.190 --> 07:16.780
and I just wanted to talk to him all about it,you know?

07:17.430 --> 07:20.410
I wanted to ride that bike again so bad,

07:20.550 --> 07:23.920
but then,just like that,

07:24.080 --> 07:26.850
no more conor donovan.

07:27.810 --> 07:29.510
I'm sorry.

07:30.560 --> 07:35.310
I didn't even know what sorry was until I saw gwen get the news.

07:35.430 --> 07:37.150
To see the life just...

07:37.670 --> 07:39.810
go right out of their eyes.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.360
That was a year ago,

07:41.580 --> 07:43.560
and you're still here.

07:44.400 --> 07:46.700
--Why?
--Look at her.

07:46.900 --> 07:47.890
How can I leave?

07:48.000 --> 07:51.340
She's got no family. She's all alone.

07:51.450 --> 07:54.140
--I have to take care of her.
--You can't.

07:54.260 --> 07:55.910
You're not really...

07:56.770 --> 07:58.770
present with her.

07:58.880 --> 08:01.640
Semantics again.

08:04.880 --> 08:08.010
--There is something else.
--What?

08:08.830 --> 08:12.350
We have to move her now,ma'am.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.640
Did you stop by the hospital?

08:25.750 --> 08:27.420
On my way in.

08:27.520 --> 08:28.930
She kept asking for you.

08:29.010 --> 08:31.270
I've known her for a year,but she asked for you?

08:31.330 --> 08:32.620
I mean,how could she even know you?

08:32.669 --> 08:34.500
She was unconscious the entire time.

08:34.610 --> 08:36.309
She saw me.

08:36.390 --> 08:36.900
When?

08:36.960 --> 08:39.549
She had an out-of-body experience before jim brought her back.

08:39.690 --> 08:43.110
Oh. I should have known it was something simple like that.

08:43.210 --> 08:44.910
She also saw her dead fiance.

08:44.960 --> 08:47.700
He's haunting her,just fyi.

08:47.730 --> 08:49.520
That's how you knew about the pills.

08:49.550 --> 08:51.080
He was at the hospital with her,too.

08:51.130 --> 08:55.280
Oh. That is so...creepy.

08:56.450 --> 08:58.480
Wait a minute.

08:59.550 --> 09:01.980
--This can't be.
--What?

09:02.400 --> 09:04.260
The county tax bill.

09:04.300 --> 09:05.730
$15,000?

09:05.870 --> 09:07.020
Small business assessment?

09:07.070 --> 09:09.730
This is like 3 times what I thought it was gonna be.

09:09.780 --> 09:12.370
If this is right,it's gonna totally blow through my savings.

09:21.690 --> 09:23.460
I saw him.

09:23.600 --> 09:26.960
I saw conor... at the apartment.

09:27.050 --> 09:29.780
--I knew he was there all along.
--I know.

09:29.880 --> 09:31.940
I saw you,too.

09:32.040 --> 09:34.100
I saw you talking to him. How did you do that?

09:34.150 --> 09:37.680
Tell her I'm here now.

09:37.730 --> 09:38.630
Tell her.

09:38.770 --> 09:41.680
I know that this is gonna sound strange,and it's..

09:41.740 --> 09:43.650
not your medication messing with your head.

09:45.170 --> 09:47.410
Um...I can see spirits.

09:47.700 --> 09:50.670
Earthbound spirits who haven't crossed over.

09:50.770 --> 09:51.830
You mean like ghosts?

09:51.850 --> 09:54.200
I don't know if they actually told you,but you...

09:55.450 --> 09:58.140
you died,only for a few seconds while my husband was working on you.

09:58.270 --> 10:01.220
He's a paramedic and...

10:01.350 --> 10:03.500
that's when you saw me...

10:03.940 --> 10:05.690
and conor.

10:05.850 --> 10:08.440
You can talk to ghosts?

10:08.930 --> 10:11.050
And hear them?

10:11.440 --> 10:12.960
How?

10:13.120 --> 10:14.970
It's a long story.

10:15.080 --> 10:18.080
Is he here now?

10:19.330 --> 10:21.660
Yes,baby,I'm right here.

10:21.820 --> 10:23.490
I've always been here.

10:23.560 --> 10:25.200
He's here.

10:25.280 --> 10:27.830
--Where? 
--Right next to you.

10:28.150 --> 10:30.190
On your left.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.870
Conor,you didn't leave me.

10:33.950 --> 10:36.610
No,baby,I told you I'd never leave you.

10:36.690 --> 10:40.220
--Can he hear me? Can he hear us? 
--Yeah.

10:40.580 --> 10:43.390
I just I wanted to see you so badly.

10:43.520 --> 10:45.210
Tell her how much I miss her.

10:45.290 --> 10:46.860
I miss talking to her.

10:46.940 --> 10:49.280
He wants you to know that he misses you.

10:49.360 --> 10:51.450
Oh,conor,I miss you,too.

10:51.610 --> 10:53.650
I feel you everywhere.It's like...

10:54.150 --> 10:57.640
my skin hurts and the inside of my bones hurt and it's just..

10:57.790 --> 10:59.840
it's so deep I can't grab ahold of it.

11:00.220 --> 11:01.360
--I know,I know.
--I can't even touch it.It's like I..

11:02.330 --> 11:04.780
baby,I feel it,too.

11:05.230 --> 11:08.190
Tell her I'm furious at her.

11:08.320 --> 11:10.150
Don't ever try that again!

11:10.330 --> 11:12.120
He's mad at you

11:12.230 --> 11:13.680
for what you did,and he doesn't want you to ever..

11:13.790 --> 11:15.340
no,I won'T. I won'T.

11:16.280 --> 11:19.190
That's enough for tonight.

11:20.720 --> 11:22.170
--Don't go. 
--I won't.

11:22.240 --> 11:23.770
Baby,don't worry.

11:24.530 --> 11:25.820
Hey,we'll see you soon,ok?

11:25.930 --> 11:28.800
Get some rest.

11:32.020 --> 11:34.390
Ok.

11:45.070 --> 11:46.350
See what I mean? She's the..

11:46.440 --> 11:49.360
She's the same now as she was the day I died.

11:49.420 --> 11:52.420
You said there was one more thing you need to do before you could go.

11:52.500 --> 11:53.310
what is it?

11:53.390 --> 11:54.800
It might sound kind of morbid.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.180
Hello. I'm talking to a dead person.

11:57.260 --> 11:58.600
I was an organ donor and...

11:58.690 --> 12:01.020
the day I died,they took my heart.

12:02.640 --> 12:05.430
I need to see who has it.

12:05.560 --> 12:07.390
Why?

12:08.070 --> 12:11.510
I'v...I've...I've got to see what kind of person is..

12:11.810 --> 12:15.180
I need to know that they're taking good care of it.

12:15.260 --> 12:17.060
Like waxing and cleaning it?

12:17.170 --> 12:20.190
No. I just want to be sure they--

12:20.250 --> 12:22.180
you know,that it went to somebody...

12:22.260 --> 12:24.190
worthy.

12:26.020 --> 12:27.850
I'm sorry.

12:28.450 --> 12:30.140
And if you find that person,

12:30.250 --> 12:31.970
if you see them,will you...

12:32.050 --> 12:33.440
cross over,move on?

12:33.510 --> 12:36.310
What if I am happy here?

12:36.630 --> 12:39.280
This isn't the place for you anymore.

12:42.550 --> 12:45.030
If gwen gets better,

12:45.130 --> 12:47.180
if I feel she is taken care of...

12:47.310 --> 12:49.910
then you'll go?

12:50.620 --> 12:52.790
Yes.

13:02.410 --> 13:04.060
We're surrounded

13:04.300 --> 13:08.280
by a world of things

13:08.650 --> 13:11.670
but it's never enough

13:12.120 --> 13:17.000
to give us what we want

13:19.190 --> 13:22.640
but if we all stop

13:22.800 --> 13:27.110
with our self-distraction

13:27.290 --> 13:32.150
we'll start a world reaction...

13:32.230 --> 13:34.050
he was the kindest man.

13:34.130 --> 13:37.290
He was always trying to make somebody else's job easier.

13:37.340 --> 13:38.910
We would be at a restaurant

13:38.950 --> 13:42.030
and he would brush the crumbs off the table,

13:42.110 --> 13:45.230
sweep them into his palm and just hold them

13:45.410 --> 13:46.870
until he could throw them out.

13:46.940 --> 13:48.850
And he would grin at me and wink,

13:48.900 --> 13:51.070
like it was our little secret.

13:51.880 --> 13:54.360
That's the thing about being with conor.

13:54.440 --> 13:57.890
It felt like he was letting you in on this big secret,

13:57.970 --> 13:59.230
something just for the two of us.

13:59.310 --> 14:03.640
Ask her if she remembers the time we got lost in boston.

14:07.870 --> 14:10.430
He's here.

14:10.590 --> 14:13.460
I knew it. I thought I felt him touch me.

14:13.570 --> 14:14.990
Well,kind of,anyway.

14:15.100 --> 14:17.360
It was like a feather against my arm.

14:17.440 --> 14:18.970
Sometimes spirits can let you feel their energy.

14:19.090 --> 14:22.100
It's no more than like a little rush of air.

14:22.150 --> 14:24.720
Yeah,right. I feel that a lot.

14:24.830 --> 14:27.200
Does he dim the lights sometimes,too?

14:27.340 --> 14:29.880
They can also use their energy to affect electricity

14:30.000 --> 14:32.270
if they try really hard.

14:32.660 --> 14:35.300
How do you know all this?

14:37.290 --> 14:41.170
Gwen,the thing that I do... my job,

14:41.280 --> 14:44.610
I guess you could say,is to help people get closure,

14:45.190 --> 14:46.680
make peace with death,

14:46.770 --> 14:50.160
sometimes get important messages across.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.310
But it's all so that people can move on,

14:54.440 --> 14:57.410
people who die,people who are left behind.

14:58.160 --> 15:01.600
The idea is to move on.

15:03.530 --> 15:06.390
It's time for him to go.

15:06.500 --> 15:10.580
Did I tell you he used to read to me if i couldn't fall asleep?

15:11.850 --> 15:15.450
There will never be anybody else like him,not for me.

15:15.580 --> 15:18.260
--I know it seems that way. 
--No,it is that way.

15:18.890 --> 15:21.160
Everything happens for a reason,

15:21.240 --> 15:24.000
and that is why conor is still here.

15:24.100 --> 15:26.920
That's fate,and there's nothing that you can do about it.

15:28.400 --> 15:30.440
Ok.

15:33.150 --> 15:36.140
I want to talk about boston.

15:38.050 --> 15:40.870
How come a ghost would know where his heart went?

15:40.980 --> 15:44.210
Probably because he went straight to gwen when he died.

15:45.220 --> 15:47.250
Oh. I'm not sure it's such a great idea.

15:47.390 --> 15:49.040
Why not?

15:49.980 --> 15:51.550
Well,maybe a recipient doesn't want to know

15:51.660 --> 15:54.400
where his organ came from

15:54.510 --> 15:55.180
especially a heart.

15:55.260 --> 15:57.460
And that's a hard enough ordeal to go through.

15:57.540 --> 16:00.140
They're asking you to meet the person who gave you your heart

16:00.220 --> 16:02.540
and by the way,that person's dead.

16:02.590 --> 16:04.810
It's been a year. Maybe he's curious.

16:04.870 --> 16:07.450
Besides,it's the only way I'm gonna get this guy to cross over

16:07.500 --> 16:09.400
so just tell me where to start.

16:09.460 --> 16:11.580
Well,if he died at mercy,they've got a helipad,

16:11.660 --> 16:15.230
so his organs would have been harvested immediately and choppered right out.

16:15.510 --> 16:18.360
But you are gonna need somebody at the hospital

16:18.470 --> 16:21.010
whose willing to bend the rules a little bit.

16:21.060 --> 16:22.730
We never give out that kind of information.

16:22.830 --> 16:23.820
Yeah,I know,but the thing is,

16:23.900 --> 16:24.950
I'm not trying to get you in any trouble.

16:25.020 --> 16:26.720
It's just,the information is for someone very...

16:26.800 --> 16:28.550
are you family?

16:29.330 --> 16:33.080
Well,in the family of man sense,I guess.

16:33.190 --> 16:35.410
Sorry. No way. Anything else?

16:35.490 --> 16:37.270
Can you at least give me cities and initials?

16:37.320 --> 16:41.170
This isn't jeopardy!. Bye,now.

16:42.920 --> 16:44.430
Aw,damn.

16:44.540 --> 16:46.150
The second generator didn't kick in.

16:46.200 --> 16:49.820
Please wait here till the lights come back.

17:32.810 --> 17:35.070
Can you help me?

17:40.050 --> 17:42.830
Donor's name...

17:42.940 --> 17:45.180
date of death...

17:45.290 --> 17:50.890
and the code r-w-h-o-D.

17:54.250 --> 17:57.350
Hurry.

18:02.800 --> 18:06.710
Ok. Got it. Thank you.

18:06.820 --> 18:09.030
Can I do anything for you?

18:09.110 --> 18:12.550
Rain check.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.080
Everything ok?

18:17.180 --> 18:19.420
You can go now,if that's what you mean?

18:22.590 --> 18:24.980
Damn.

19:22.580 --> 19:25.280
anyway,coming these past few weeks,

19:25.380 --> 19:27.530
listening,watching...

19:27.590 --> 19:29.420
it was my doctor's idea,not mine.

19:29.500 --> 19:30.020
He's always telling me to try--

19:30.050 --> 19:33.020
we usually begin our talks with the introduction.

19:33.110 --> 19:35.270
Oh,yeah. Ok.

19:35.370 --> 19:36.700
My name is cliff aimes,

19:36.780 --> 19:38.370
and it's been a year since my surgery.

19:38.450 --> 19:40.950
Please tell everyone what kind of surgery.

19:41.650 --> 19:44.220
Transplant.

19:44.770 --> 19:48.340
Congratulations on your "surgiversary."

19:49.250 --> 19:51.700
Yeah,but the thing is,

19:51.830 --> 19:54.030
I've had a bad heart my whole life.

19:54.140 --> 19:56.320
I always felt like I had one foot in the grave

19:56.420 --> 19:58.580
and the other one on a banana peel.

20:00.940 --> 20:03.570
Ow.It's a tough room.

20:04.090 --> 20:09.020
I mean,it's not like I'm not grateful for the heart I got. I am.

20:09.080 --> 20:13.580
I just... I feel even more afraid now,like...

20:14.570 --> 20:17.670
maybe I don't even deserve to have it.

20:21.550 --> 20:23.730
Maybe someone else should talk.

20:32.230 --> 20:34.730
I really liked what you had to say.

20:35.630 --> 20:36.830
Why?

20:36.940 --> 20:39.120
It sounded like the truth.

20:39.590 --> 20:42.370
--Melinda gordon. --Cliff aimes.

20:46.950 --> 20:48.280
Don't tell me you're a heart patient.

20:48.390 --> 20:51.730
No. No,I'm more like a student.

20:51.860 --> 20:53.320
Studying what?

20:53.440 --> 20:55.670
The impact on people with things like this.

20:56.030 --> 20:58.370
--Things like? 
--Transplants.

20:58.480 --> 20:59.420
The emotional impact...

20:59.500 --> 21:01.910
you know,what it's like to get a second chance.

21:02.030 --> 21:04.430
I'm still trying to figure out what went wrong with the first chance.

21:04.510 --> 21:06.360
Maybe you could help me.

21:06.590 --> 21:07.670
I don't think so.

21:07.780 --> 21:10.040
I'm just curious.

21:10.150 --> 21:12.540
You may have noticed,I don't excel at talking to groups.

21:12.620 --> 21:15.630
I'm not too good at talking one-on-one either,so...

21:15.710 --> 21:17.740
it was nice to meet you.

21:18.470 --> 21:21.870
Do you ever find yourself thinking about the donor?

21:24.680 --> 21:26.740
Why would you ask me that?

21:26.820 --> 21:27.790
I mean,it's a natural thing to...

21:27.840 --> 21:30.630
what else do you want to ask me?

21:30.700 --> 21:32.880
If I get hungry for things I never liked before?

21:32.930 --> 21:34.630
If I smell things so freakin' familiar

21:34.670 --> 21:37.090
I just can't figure out what they are?

21:37.310 --> 21:38.900
Do you?

21:40.200 --> 21:43.610
Ask me if I feel guilty because some guy I didn't know is dead

21:43.710 --> 21:47.100
and I'm here,talking to you about it.

21:55.840 --> 21:57.330
Well,what did you expect?

21:57.430 --> 21:59.480
I expected somebody filled with joy

21:59.590 --> 22:01.720
about having a new lease on life.

22:01.780 --> 22:04.800
And you got andy rooney.

22:05.930 --> 22:07.410
Hey,how's gwen?

22:07.510 --> 22:08.760
Feeling better.

22:08.810 --> 22:11.420
Is her fiance still making things go bump in the night?

22:11.470 --> 22:14.550
Sometimes I don't know who's holding who back...

22:15.670 --> 22:16.740
but every time I see them together,

22:16.790 --> 22:19.610
the only thing that I can think of is how lucky we are...

22:20.830 --> 22:23.710
and what they'd give to have what we have.

22:24.830 --> 22:28.670
Let's not ever take that for granted,ok?

22:30.400 --> 22:32.750
Deal.

22:32.860 --> 22:35.460
Even so,if something ever happened to me

22:35.540 --> 22:37.570
and you were alone,I would want you to be happy.

22:37.770 --> 22:41.290
No. I'd want you to find someone and find love again.

22:42.590 --> 22:44.210
I mean,wouldn't you want the same thing for me

22:44.260 --> 22:45.850
if something happened to you?

22:46.430 --> 22:50.540
--No. --No?! You wouldn't want me to be happy?

22:50.610 --> 22:51.960
Fine. Sure I would,ok?

22:52.070 --> 22:53.990
Make friends,go out and make money,be happy,

22:54.090 --> 22:57.090
--but no other guy. --Ok.

23:00.120 --> 23:02.120
Out of the question.

23:03.870 --> 23:06.860
How did I snag such a sensitive,modern man?

23:06.940 --> 23:09.140
Guess you can just call me lucky.

23:27.850 --> 23:29.560
hey,look at this.

23:29.670 --> 23:32.110
It says that my tax bill was paid in full.

23:32.180 --> 23:33.390
Who could have done this?

23:33.450 --> 23:34.360
Wow! I don't know.

23:34.410 --> 23:36.530
Maybe somebody you helped or something?

23:36.560 --> 23:39.170
Who? I don't know anybody who has this kind of money

23:39.220 --> 23:40.780
and how would they know?

23:40.830 --> 23:42.350
I'm gonna call the tax board and find out.

23:42.420 --> 23:47.220
Anyway,I decided that we should get gwen out of her apartment.

23:47.300 --> 23:49.970
Right? I mean,she really needs a girls' night out.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.200
That's a great idea.

23:51.230 --> 23:54.360
Cool. So saturday night,lento's on the square?

23:54.440 --> 23:56.460
--No karaoke? 
--Cross my heart.

23:57.090 --> 23:59.430
I'll be there.

24:59.110 --> 25:00.670
Aren't you haunting the wrong girl?

25:00.750 --> 25:02.730
Is that him?

25:09.480 --> 25:10.960
Hi.

25:11.010 --> 25:12.260
What are you doing here?

25:12.360 --> 25:14.990
Um...take my picture?

25:15.040 --> 25:16.470
You don't meet the height requirement.

25:16.550 --> 25:18.010
Excuse me. I have to develop these.

25:18.050 --> 25:20.480
Develop?Thought everyone uses digital now.

25:20.540 --> 25:22.470
Everyone does. I don'T.

25:22.690 --> 25:24.400
Listen,can I talk to you?

25:25.490 --> 25:27.470
Digital is electronic. It's cold.

25:27.970 --> 25:30.130
Film is chemical.

25:30.600 --> 25:31.870
It's emotional.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.780
There's no comparison.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.470
Did you take these?

25:36.550 --> 25:37.350
You have a wonderful eye.

25:37.400 --> 25:39.980
You should put them out,let people see them.

25:40.060 --> 25:43.050
Yeah. They'd just remind me of something else I never became.

25:44.770 --> 25:46.050
No!

25:46.200 --> 25:50.210
Does he have any idea what he is doing to my heart?

25:52.400 --> 25:55.000
--Do you smell that? 
--What?

25:56.270 --> 25:57.790
Like flowers?

25:58.130 --> 25:59.110
Gardenias.

25:59.750 --> 26:01.260
No.

26:02.130 --> 26:03.640
Now it's gone.

26:03.720 --> 26:06.370
That drives me crazy!

26:06.550 --> 26:08.920
Weren't you happy to get a new heart?

26:08.980 --> 26:12.230
What? You don't think I'm grateful?

26:12.310 --> 26:14.790
You don't think I wake up at night and hear it beating

26:14.810 --> 26:16.530
and just not understand

26:17.230 --> 26:20.320
why I should be so lucky?

26:22.280 --> 26:24.640
Sometimes I think they just wasted this on me.

26:24.720 --> 26:26.910
He thinks too much.

26:27.440 --> 26:29.630
Maybe I just don't know how to use it.

26:29.710 --> 26:31.320
I know you've been sick your whole life,

26:31.400 --> 26:33.370
and maybe you've just been sick for so long,

26:33.470 --> 26:35.710
you don't know how to be well.

26:40.060 --> 26:42.030
Look,there's no reason for you to listen to me

26:42.090 --> 26:44.900
and there's no reason for you to trust me. I'm just...

26:46.310 --> 26:48.700
there's someone I'd like you to meet,

26:49.250 --> 26:51.410
someone I think you'd have something...

26:51.490 --> 26:53.860
profound in common with.

26:53.970 --> 26:56.570
I think you'd both get a lot out of it.

26:56.650 --> 26:59.070
You have to have an open mind,though.

26:59.960 --> 27:01.880
Who?

27:02.200 --> 27:06.970
Cliff aimes,I'd like you to meet gwen alexander.

27:10.490 --> 27:14.660
Sorry. You just look so familiar.

27:15.570 --> 27:17.110
Hi.

27:17.860 --> 27:20.770
Well,um... we have a table all ready,so...

27:20.900 --> 27:22.630
well,why don't you two go on ahead,

27:22.680 --> 27:24.460
and we'll be in in a minute.

27:24.910 --> 27:26.980
We will? I'm starving.

27:27.140 --> 27:27.930
Then why don't you show them the table

27:28.040 --> 27:30.210
and come back out and talk to me for a minute?

27:31.510 --> 27:32.100
All right.

27:32.150 --> 27:33.540
What are you doing?

27:33.620 --> 27:35.240
You were supposed to introduce him to me.

27:35.320 --> 27:37.170
Semantics. You said you wanted to see him.

27:37.250 --> 27:38.990
You said nothing about meeting him.

27:41.310 --> 27:42.570
He's not her type.

27:42.650 --> 27:45.540
Look,we'll talk about this later.

27:45.800 --> 27:48.960
Lucy,you have some's plaining to do.

27:49.040 --> 27:52.480
I just want give them a few minute alone,let them talk

28:02.060 --> 28:03.570
Maybe we should order.

28:03.650 --> 28:05.110
Yeah.

28:08.920 --> 28:10.820
You said that I looked familiar.

28:10.870 --> 28:11.980
What did you mean?

28:12.090 --> 28:14.850
Like I've seen you somewhere before.

28:14.930 --> 28:16.990
I get like this a lot lately.

28:20.400 --> 28:21.650
Do you smell that?

28:21.760 --> 28:22.360
The bread?

28:22.440 --> 28:24.830
No. Uh,sweet...

28:24.890 --> 28:26.890
like gardenia?

28:27.290 --> 28:29.060
Oh,that's my perfume.

28:29.130 --> 28:29.680
It's too much,maybe.

28:29.760 --> 28:32.160
No. No,I--

28:32.460 --> 28:34.030
I've been smelling it for such a long time,

28:34.100 --> 28:36.540
I just--I can never figure out where it's coming from.

28:43.380 --> 28:46.410
Excuse me. There's a couple over there in the corner,breaking up.

28:46.490 --> 28:48.680
I think they need you more than we do right now.

28:49.360 --> 28:50.370
Thank you.

28:51.260 --> 28:53.910
Play a happy song,at least.

28:55.470 --> 28:57.270
What sort of work do you do?

28:57.460 --> 29:00.190
I'm a teacher,fourth grade.

29:00.610 --> 29:02.700
I haven't felt much like working since...

29:02.770 --> 29:04.000
I love kids.

29:04.060 --> 29:05.910
They're the only original thinkers in the world.

29:05.970 --> 29:08.090
Really?

29:08.150 --> 29:09.620
Do you have any kids?

29:09.670 --> 29:11.460
No. Hell,no.

29:12.110 --> 29:15.120
I've had a lot of health problems lately,

29:15.200 --> 29:18.870
so I figured I'd never be around long enough to..

29:19.070 --> 29:20.890
have them.

29:22.610 --> 29:24.130
Sorry. Did I say something?

29:24.200 --> 29:27.040
No. I'm sorry. I do this a lot lately.

29:27.120 --> 29:28.430
Me,too.

29:28.480 --> 29:29.750
You cry?

29:29.800 --> 29:32.300
Especially lately.

29:32.380 --> 29:33.440
I don't know why.

29:33.490 --> 29:34.810
I just...

29:34.860 --> 29:36.410
I'll see something--

29:37.770 --> 29:39.800
the look on someone's face or...

29:41.360 --> 29:44.070
Or the way a dog watches me...

29:45.450 --> 29:47.280
and all of a sudden,I just...

29:47.540 --> 29:49.780
can't stop crying.

30:00.140 --> 30:01.990
Are you ok?

30:02.640 --> 30:05.010
I'm sorry. I have to go.

30:06.740 --> 30:07.860
Excuse me.

30:12.210 --> 30:13.060
Was that a date?

30:13.120 --> 30:14.250
Did it feel like one?

30:14.300 --> 30:16.520
Considering she left before we even ordered food,

30:16.570 --> 30:19.350
I'd say,roughly,yes. That's my usual date.

30:19.400 --> 30:21.230
But what did you think of her?

30:22.550 --> 30:27.130
I feel like ...I know her.

30:28.380 --> 30:30.460
How weird is that?

30:31.040 --> 30:33.400
I felt...

30:34.120 --> 30:35.770
ah,forget it.

30:35.850 --> 30:36.800
Ooh. Forget it.

30:36.830 --> 30:39.070
No. She's someone worth knowing.

30:39.130 --> 30:41.720
Take a chance.

30:42.200 --> 30:43.600
Why?

30:43.710 --> 30:45.880
Look,you're all about avoiding. I get it.

30:45.930 --> 30:49.140
But just ask yourself this:

30:49.210 --> 30:51.730
Why did you accept that heart?

30:51.800 --> 30:55.490
Was it to avoid death,or was it to choose life?

31:02.110 --> 31:04.170
I think you owe me an explanation.

31:06.020 --> 31:10.780
Ok,it seemed to me like cliff and gwen might have some things in common.

31:11.150 --> 31:12.740
Me.

31:13.580 --> 31:15.560
She doesn't need this.

31:15.630 --> 31:17.090
Can't you see how much pain she's in?

31:17.170 --> 31:18.540
We had a deal.

31:18.780 --> 31:20.710
You promised you would cross over.

31:20.810 --> 31:22.500
Gwen's not ready.

31:22.580 --> 31:24.370
Conor,let me me honest.

31:25.020 --> 31:28.780
It's not gwen that has the problem here. It's you.

31:29.010 --> 31:31.430
And it's not like she doesn't want to move on,

31:31.510 --> 31:32.770
it's that you won't let her.

31:32.840 --> 31:34.180
That is ridiculous.

31:34.260 --> 31:36.090
I don't interfere in any way.

31:36.170 --> 31:37.840
She feels your presence.

31:37.900 --> 31:38.880
She know you're there,

31:38.960 --> 31:41.020
and you're holding her back by staying in her life,

31:41.100 --> 31:42.460
and this thing with cliff--

31:42.490 --> 31:44.100
it's not about him.

31:44.160 --> 31:45.280
It's about her taking a step.

31:45.360 --> 31:46.580
It's about her moving forward

31:46.640 --> 31:48.750
and you letting go.

31:48.910 --> 31:51.230
She loves me.

31:51.830 --> 31:53.830
I know that,conor

31:54.440 --> 31:57.220
and I know that you love her,too.

31:57.320 --> 31:59.670
But she can't love a dead man

31:59.740 --> 32:00.810
not the way that you want her to,

32:00.890 --> 32:03.960
and you can't love her the way that she wants you to

32:04.100 --> 32:05.160
the way that she needs you to,

32:05.210 --> 32:09.040
and it's not right to expect it.

32:10.320 --> 32:11.710
Everything all right?

32:11.810 --> 32:13.340
Yeah. Sorry if we woke you.

32:13.420 --> 32:16.130
This one's having a bit of a boundary problem.

32:16.600 --> 32:18.240
Don't they all?

32:26.410 --> 32:31.050
Ok. Let's have gwen decide.

32:33.060 --> 32:33.940
What?

32:34.070 --> 32:35.380
Tomorrow.

32:35.430 --> 32:37.860
We'll ask gwen straight out what she wants,

32:37.910 --> 32:39.630
and I'll respect her wishes

32:39.690 --> 32:43.300
but if she says that she wants me to stay with her...

32:45.380 --> 32:48.380
I want you to leave us both alone.

32:54.150 --> 32:56.750
It was a very intereresting conversation.

32:56.850 --> 32:59.150
I asked the tax board who paid my bill,

32:59.200 --> 33:04.040
and they said it was one andrea moreno.

33:07.120 --> 33:09.650
--I didn't want you to know. 
--Obviously.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.790
How do you have this kind of money?

33:11.870 --> 33:14.690
I have a little nest egg put away.

33:14.740 --> 33:16.930
And it's fine,ok? So don't worry.

33:17.350 --> 33:20.620
I--I'M... stunned.

33:20.670 --> 33:23.850
And...

33:23.900 --> 33:25.450
I can't-- I can't accept it.

33:25.500 --> 33:26.700
It's just too much.

33:26.750 --> 33:30.930
Look,just pay me back when you can afford it,ok?

33:32.050 --> 33:35.140
--Or,better yet,um... --What?

33:35.450 --> 33:39.590
you could accept the $15,000 as a down payment.

33:40.610 --> 33:42.590
For what?

33:42.810 --> 33:46.050
For... making me your partner.

33:46.160 --> 33:49.210
Andrea,I already consider you my partner.

33:49.340 --> 33:51.320
Melinda,I love it here.

33:51.390 --> 33:52.360
You know,I love the people,

33:52.420 --> 33:53.900
and I love this place,

33:53.960 --> 33:56.750
and I have a little bit of money put away,

33:56.800 --> 33:59.120
and I could pay you something really fair,

33:59.170 --> 34:01.730
and we could grow this place together.

34:01.780 --> 34:03.800
I don't know what to say.

34:04.380 --> 34:07.280
Well...say,"yes." I mean...

34:07.370 --> 34:10.580
"yes," is all you have to say. You could say,"yes."

34:15.699 --> 34:16.659
Yes.

34:17.900 --> 34:20.500
--Yeah? Yes? 
--Yes,I would love for you to be my partner.

34:20.580 --> 34:24.330
Oh,thank you so much. You don't know how much this means to me.

34:26.190 --> 34:28.170
--I'm so happy. 
--Partner,partner

34:28.250 --> 34:31.050
My life just got much easier

34:32.250 --> 34:36.219
I've been doing a lot of thinking lately about the whole manwoman thing

34:37.239 --> 34:40.810
and why I've never been too good at it.

34:40.900 --> 34:42.520
Maybe it's because

34:42.570 --> 34:45.469
I would always hide inside my illness.

34:45.550 --> 34:47.750
I never had to give too much.

34:47.820 --> 34:50.350
I never had to take too much.

34:50.429 --> 34:52.350
After all,I had other things to worry about,

34:52.429 --> 34:55.710
like "would I be alive next week?"

34:57.650 --> 34:59.450
And after a while,I...

35:01.140 --> 35:02.890
I stopped thinking about it,

35:02.940 --> 35:06.460
and it got easier to be alone,

35:07.220 --> 35:09.540
didn't have to take any chances,

35:09.620 --> 35:12.280
the joys of a risk-free life.

35:14.050 --> 35:15.900
And now...

35:16.500 --> 35:18.060
I have this...

35:18.260 --> 35:21.940
strong,new heart...

35:22.470 --> 35:25.090
and I can feel it beating inside my chest,

35:25.350 --> 35:28.190
like it wants to come out,

35:28.410 --> 35:30.760
like it's saying,"give me more."

35:32.640 --> 35:36.130
And...I don't want to...

35:36.340 --> 35:38.510
stop this feeling,but...

35:39.850 --> 35:42.320
I wanna fill it.

35:43.470 --> 35:44.670
Like I,uh...

35:45.710 --> 35:48.580
I have to fill it.

35:51.340 --> 35:55.060
And I don't even know if I know...how,exactly.

35:58.580 --> 36:00.740
But I'm gonna try.

36:09.530 --> 36:11.800
Can he be talking about gwen?

36:15.160 --> 36:17.740
You never told me what you thought of cliff.

36:17.880 --> 36:19.580
Is conor here?

36:19.680 --> 36:21.710
You can speak freely.

36:26.490 --> 36:28.940
I did like cliff. I did.

36:29.140 --> 36:30.940
He was funny.

36:31.780 --> 36:34.360
I feel like I'm being unfaithful.

36:36.130 --> 36:39.720
It's like conor is my guardian angel.

36:39.800 --> 36:43.500
It's so comfortable when he's here,so familiar.

36:44.190 --> 36:45.480
So safe?

36:45.560 --> 36:50.820
Being with cliff,even for a few minutes last night,it was... fun.

36:51.260 --> 36:53.540
I feel like I knew him.

36:53.620 --> 36:56.260
We talked about kids for a second,

36:56.310 --> 36:59.700
and it made me want to go back to work.

37:02.400 --> 37:04.980
But I crave conor so much.

37:15.750 --> 37:17.200
Conor.

37:17.300 --> 37:20.250
I love you so much.

37:22.130 --> 37:25.880
All I want is to be with you every day and every night.

37:27.680 --> 37:29.100
Just like it used to be.

37:31.710 --> 37:34.530
Will you--will you tell her that,please?

37:34.620 --> 37:36.420
He's telling you that he loves you,

37:36.670 --> 37:38.850
that he wants to be with you all the time.

37:38.930 --> 37:40.990
I love you,too,conor.

37:41.610 --> 37:45.000
But I don't want you to live a risk-free life.

37:45.050 --> 37:48.290
You shouldn't waste your heart on a dead man.

37:50.010 --> 37:52.590
He's letting you go,gwen.

37:55.540 --> 37:58.460
No. No,conor.

37:58.630 --> 38:01.570
No. I didn't mean what I said before.

38:01.650 --> 38:02.660
I want you.

38:02.690 --> 38:04.040
Don'T...let me go.

38:04.090 --> 38:05.320
I can't do this without you.

38:05.370 --> 38:07.750
That's why I have to go.

38:08.230 --> 38:09.890
What is he saying? What...

38:09.960 --> 38:11.510
he's leaving. Gwen,

38:12.150 --> 38:14.760
he's crossing over.

38:15.550 --> 38:19.040
Wait until after I go,and then tell her

38:19.100 --> 38:22.250
when she thinks of all the things we did...

38:23.520 --> 38:26.820
it'll remind her that love is possible.

38:26.890 --> 38:28.850
Conor...what?

38:31.560 --> 38:33.960
She'll find it again.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.440
I will.

38:36.500 --> 38:39.840
What? What...what is he saying?

38:58.510 --> 39:00.580
I love you.

39:16.330 --> 39:18.500
He's gone.

39:18.970 --> 39:20.840
He's gone.

39:51.180 --> 39:53.690
I have been dying to do this since we moved here.

39:53.770 --> 39:57.660
"Saturday night,grandview players." High drama.

39:57.730 --> 40:00.450
I just hope the theater isn't haunted.

40:00.530 --> 40:02.040
Be nice to sit through the entire play.

40:02.120 --> 40:05.600
Hey. You know,cliff and gwen saw this last week,and they loved it.

40:06.460 --> 40:07.910
What do you think's gonna happen with those two?

40:07.960 --> 40:09.160
Who knows?

40:09.210 --> 40:10.930
It almost doesn't matter.

40:11.190 --> 40:14.630
You know,they're good for each other right now.That's all that counts.

40:15.370 --> 40:18.230
Right now... is all that counts.

40:18.310 --> 40:20.140
Mm. You think so?

40:20.210 --> 40:24.150
As in,"why don't you and i sneak out right now?"

40:24.180 --> 40:27.280
Don't you have a life to save--or two?

40:27.360 --> 40:28.440
Probably. Whatever.

40:28.490 --> 40:30.800
Yeah. I should get back to work,too.

40:35.620 --> 40:38.050
Oh,look,I'll lose these.
