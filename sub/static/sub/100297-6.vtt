WEBVTT

00:04.684 --> 00:06.595
You know, I got to be
honest with you, Reverend.

00:06.596 --> 00:08.522
As much as I enjoy your sermons,

00:08.524 --> 00:11.017
your guest preacher
today was pretty amazing.

00:11.019 --> 00:12.913
PAUL: Yeah, and Kyle's
not even a minister.

00:12.915 --> 00:16.082
- Makes me wonder if I overpaid for seminary.
- (CHUCKLES)

00:16.085 --> 00:18.618
(SIGHS) Personally,
I didn't care for it.

00:18.620 --> 00:20.553
- Oh, stop.
- Seriously.

00:20.555 --> 00:22.789
When Twinkle Toes here gives a sermon,

00:22.791 --> 00:24.557
I get a great nap.

00:24.559 --> 00:28.763
Kyle... kept me awake the entire time.

00:28.765 --> 00:30.565
Well, I'll be in the pulpit next week,

00:30.567 --> 00:32.133
so bring your pillow.

00:32.134 --> 00:36.062
Listen, I've got that
HR meeting at 12:00 noon.

00:36.064 --> 00:39.714
Somebody tell Billy Graham-cracker
we've got to go!

00:39.716 --> 00:41.809
(SIGHS) Let's get the hell out of here.

00:41.811 --> 00:46.246
I mean, let's stay the heck in here.

00:46.248 --> 00:48.528
Uh, we-we can't leave.
I mean, look at him.

00:48.530 --> 00:50.451
They love him. He's like Barry Manilow

00:50.453 --> 00:52.419
after a show in Vegas.

00:52.421 --> 00:55.922
They're all treating me like the
"minister's wife". It's creepy.

00:55.924 --> 00:58.258
(CHUCKLES) Mandy, I get it.

00:58.260 --> 01:00.761
You ever notice how quick
my wife bolts out of here?

01:00.763 --> 01:03.463
Yeah, I bolt out of here so fast
I didn't know you were married.

01:03.465 --> 01:04.723
VANESSA: (CHUCKLES) Yeah.

01:04.724 --> 01:06.927
Could you go see if he will get going,

01:06.929 --> 01:08.769
- please?
- Yes, yes.

01:08.771 --> 01:11.939
Do you really have a conference call?

01:11.941 --> 01:14.442
Or are you just trying
to avoid church coffee?

01:14.444 --> 01:16.477
How is it weak <i> and</i> bitter?

01:16.479 --> 01:17.670
Doesn't make any sense.

01:17.672 --> 01:19.279
All the regional HR reps are meeting

01:19.281 --> 01:20.481
to try to pitch a new manual.

01:20.483 --> 01:22.005
Kyle's got to be there for this.

01:22.007 --> 01:24.270
You know, I think it's kind
of amazing how far Kyle's come

01:24.272 --> 01:25.607
- at Outdoor Man.
- MIKE: Yeah.

01:25.609 --> 01:26.987
- I'm really proud of him.
- MIKE: Well, you should

01:26.989 --> 01:29.856
be proud of me, I'm the one
that, you know, made him.

01:29.858 --> 01:32.159
Kyle's sermon was about humility.

01:32.161 --> 01:34.462
Are you sure you were awake for that?

01:34.464 --> 01:36.831
I am proud of the kid, too.

01:36.833 --> 01:39.651
As a matter of fact, I'm
working on convincing Ed

01:39.653 --> 01:41.635
- to have him be the HR supervisor...
- (GASPS)

01:41.637 --> 01:43.169
... for the whole region.

01:43.171 --> 01:44.638
Wow. Oh, wow.

01:44.640 --> 01:46.172
That would be pretty incredible.

01:46.174 --> 01:48.041
- No kidding.
- Yeah.

01:48.043 --> 01:49.642
Is there anything this kid can't do?

01:49.644 --> 01:51.379
Yeah. Yeah.

01:51.381 --> 01:53.583
Can't get away from
a bunch of old women.

01:55.484 --> 01:57.486
♪♪

02:02.324 --> 02:04.858
Tell him to move his car, Baxter.

02:04.860 --> 02:06.994
Why even have an Employee
of the Month parking spot

02:06.996 --> 02:10.967
if the Employee of the Month...
me... doesn't get to park in it?

02:12.502 --> 02:14.834
I named you Employee of the Month.

02:14.836 --> 02:17.004
You know, isn't the prestige enough?

02:17.006 --> 02:18.680
Do you need all the trappings?

02:18.682 --> 02:20.407
CHUCK: There are no trappings.

02:20.409 --> 02:21.823
There's just a-a parking spot

02:21.825 --> 02:23.010
ten feet closer to the door.

02:23.012 --> 02:26.012
Which you've stolen for a week.

02:26.014 --> 02:28.082
You've gone mad.

02:28.084 --> 02:29.683
You're-You're unstable.

02:29.685 --> 02:31.584
M-Mike, what-what are
you gonna do about this?

02:31.586 --> 02:33.019
I've already done something about it.

02:33.021 --> 02:34.522
You guys have been on speakerphone.

02:34.524 --> 02:35.923
- What?
- With who?

02:35.925 --> 02:38.692
Kyle Anderson.

02:38.694 --> 02:40.930
Human Resources.

02:42.330 --> 02:45.266
You guys are in trouble.

02:45.268 --> 02:47.869
Seriously? Again with the parking spot?

02:47.871 --> 02:49.737
Just trying to right a wrong, Kyle.

02:49.739 --> 02:51.272
No, no, I'll tell you what's wrong.

02:51.274 --> 02:52.906
The two of you, coming in here

02:52.908 --> 02:56.444
and wasting Mr. B's valuable
time with this, this...

02:56.446 --> 02:58.880
May I cuss?

02:58.882 --> 03:00.214
Please.

03:00.216 --> 03:01.415
... crapola!

03:01.417 --> 03:02.917
MIKE: Oh!

03:02.919 --> 03:05.386
You guys are in serious trouble.

03:05.388 --> 03:07.720
Look, on Sunday my fellow HR reps and I,

03:07.722 --> 03:09.891
we talked about how to
handle situations like this.

03:09.893 --> 03:11.758
It was when we were
discussing the chapter,

03:11.760 --> 03:14.127
"Dealing With Children".

03:14.129 --> 03:17.565
Watch it, son. I don't like your tone.

03:17.567 --> 03:20.871
I don't like my tone, either.

03:22.270 --> 03:24.071
So here's what we're gonna do, okay?

03:24.073 --> 03:26.628
We're gonna take a five
minute cooling-off period,

03:26.630 --> 03:29.310
and then the three of us
are gonna reconvene in my office

03:29.312 --> 03:32.078
where we can deal with this like adults.

03:32.080 --> 03:33.446
Can we try that?

03:33.448 --> 03:35.448
I'm good with it.

03:35.450 --> 03:36.649
Thank you.

03:36.651 --> 03:39.089
Mr. Alzate?

03:43.292 --> 03:44.961
Fine.

03:47.930 --> 03:49.964
Did you hear the way
that kid spoke to me?

03:49.966 --> 03:52.632
I was sitting right here.

03:52.634 --> 03:55.101
And what do you propose
we do about that?

03:55.103 --> 03:59.339
I propose we make Kyle
regional HR supervisor.

03:59.341 --> 04:01.578
Exactly.

04:06.181 --> 04:08.753
Ah... Take that! Ah... Take that!

04:08.755 --> 04:11.951
(WHIMPERS) I'm out of
bullets. I'm out of bullets!

04:11.953 --> 04:14.020
I told you to get more at the armory.

04:14.022 --> 04:16.790
Ah! They're biting me! (SCREAMING)

04:16.791 --> 04:18.826
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

04:18.827 --> 04:20.360
What's-what's going on?

04:20.362 --> 04:23.330
Uh, she's trying to save
the world from zombies.

04:23.332 --> 04:26.467
But I'm only one little girl.

04:26.469 --> 04:27.968
What is this, a video game?

04:27.970 --> 04:29.537
- Virtual reality.
- Oh.

04:29.539 --> 04:31.998
We got it for Boyd and
he's gotten really good

04:32.000 --> 04:34.307
at killing zombies and
blowing up Star Destroyers,

04:34.309 --> 04:38.145
and really bad at finishing
his homework, so...

04:38.147 --> 04:40.824
W-Why is it here? And-and
why don't you just tell him

04:40.826 --> 04:42.383
he can play after he does his homework?

04:42.385 --> 04:44.819
Well, it's not just him.
Ryan plays all the time, too.

04:44.821 --> 04:47.289
And, frankly, I've lost a day or two.

04:49.187 --> 04:51.509
You want a turn, Vanessa?
You get to blow stuff up.

04:51.511 --> 04:53.059
- No, I don't want a turn.
- Wh...

04:53.061 --> 04:55.162
- You know, when I was a kid...
- Here we go.

04:55.164 --> 04:57.165
No, wait a minute. Now, wait.

04:57.167 --> 05:00.029
We would get on our bikes to explore.

05:00.031 --> 05:02.235
- We'd go to the lake, we'd climb trees.
- Hmm.

05:02.237 --> 05:05.872
We'd use our imaginations
to entertain ourselves.

05:05.874 --> 05:08.342
But, Vanessa, you're a scientist.

05:08.344 --> 05:10.009
Isn't it a little close-minded

05:10.011 --> 05:12.078
to criticize something
you've never tried?

05:12.080 --> 05:15.682
Come on, Mom, pretend you're fun.

05:15.684 --> 05:18.052
- Oh, give it to me. Give it to me. All right.
- (KRISTIN LAUGHS)

05:18.054 --> 05:20.520
- Uh... Okay.
- That...

05:20.522 --> 05:22.624
- Like this?
- I want you right... uhp.

05:22.626 --> 05:23.987
- No, no. There we go.
- Whoa. Oh. Okay.

05:23.989 --> 05:26.860
Oh, oh, it's a desert.
Okay. Uh... oh, uh...

05:26.862 --> 05:30.230
Uh, American Southwest, clearly.

05:30.232 --> 05:32.532
Um... Oh, cumulous clouds.

05:32.534 --> 05:34.033
(LAUGHS)

05:34.035 --> 05:36.369
Orange-banded sandstone and quartz?

05:36.371 --> 05:38.706
(SCOFFS) Oh, come on,
come on, make up your mind.

05:38.708 --> 05:40.876
What are you, Arizona or New Mexico?

05:42.589 --> 05:45.545
Oh, what is this? Oh, zombies.
Oh, come... This is original.

05:45.547 --> 05:47.780
- Don't just stand there. Start killing!
- This is so stupid.

05:47.782 --> 05:50.083
No. No. No, thank you.

05:50.085 --> 05:52.220
I don't have time for this nonsense.

05:52.222 --> 05:54.754
Nothing in that computer
compares to the thrill

05:54.756 --> 05:57.056
and adventure I already
get from real life.

05:57.058 --> 05:59.727
Where are you going?

05:59.729 --> 06:01.765
Big Kart. We need toilet paper.

06:06.201 --> 06:08.069
All right, uh, yeah, you
can grab the salad dressing.

06:08.071 --> 06:09.573
Great. Will do.

06:11.239 --> 06:14.475
Oh, I see you got one of
those virtual reality sets.

06:14.477 --> 06:16.244
Devil's workshop, Vanessa.

06:16.246 --> 06:18.246
Oh, no. No, no, that's not mine.

06:18.248 --> 06:20.247
I'm with you. I hate those things.

06:20.249 --> 06:23.485
Oh, no, I meant my favorite VR
game is <i> The Devil's Workshop.</i>

06:25.253 --> 06:27.121
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

06:27.123 --> 06:28.756
Oh. Look, I'm sorry I'm late.

06:28.758 --> 06:30.924
I got stuck at work.

06:30.926 --> 06:33.412
How exactly does the
boss get stuck at work?

06:33.414 --> 06:35.162
Well, maybe the boss remembered

06:35.164 --> 06:37.167
he was having dinner with his pastor.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.285
- Anything I can do? Table.
- Yeah, table.

06:41.287 --> 06:43.836
Uh... Good news.

06:43.838 --> 06:46.973
Ed signed off on giving
Kyle that new job.

06:46.975 --> 06:49.277
(GASPS) Yes! Oh, that's amazing. Great.

06:49.279 --> 06:50.444
What job?

06:50.446 --> 06:52.780
Regional director, Human Resources.

06:52.782 --> 06:55.782
Wow. You know, if Jesus
had had one of these,

06:55.784 --> 06:58.321
I don't think Judas
would've left the camp.

07:00.623 --> 07:03.493
Actually, I think there's
a better job for him.

07:05.294 --> 07:07.528
I'm gonna tell him he
should enter the ministry.

07:07.530 --> 07:09.996
- You mean become a pastor? Wow.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

07:09.998 --> 07:11.965
So, I-I chisel a rock
into a beautiful statue

07:11.967 --> 07:15.302
and the church is going
to steal that from me?

07:15.304 --> 07:17.025
(CHUCKLES) It's not stealing, Mike.

07:17.027 --> 07:19.806
- It's-It's God's calling.
- Says who?

07:19.808 --> 07:21.975
I've been praying on
this and God spoke to me.

07:21.977 --> 07:24.853
Did he, now? I've been praying, too.

07:24.855 --> 07:26.547
God spoke to me, just the other night.

07:26.549 --> 07:29.318
"Don't listen to him. I'm
just messing with him".

07:31.220 --> 07:33.919
Listen, I firmly believe this
is part of the Lord's plan,

07:33.921 --> 07:36.038
and I don't think even
the great Mike Baxter

07:36.040 --> 07:37.123
wants to compete with God.

07:37.125 --> 07:39.225
Oh, I don't think God's
above a little competition.

07:39.227 --> 07:40.994
Look, we both want
the same thing, right?

07:40.996 --> 07:44.331
I say, let the best dude win.

07:44.333 --> 07:47.870
Honey? Did you just call out God?

07:49.237 --> 07:51.167
We could also make it a
little more interesting.

07:51.169 --> 07:52.338
Put a little wager on it.

07:52.340 --> 07:54.208
Ugh, it just got worse, I...

07:54.210 --> 07:58.067
Okay, I hardly think
it's appropriate to bet

07:58.069 --> 07:59.746
on the Almighty's divine plan.

07:59.748 --> 08:01.881
Yeah? How about a
30-year-old bottle of scotch?

08:01.883 --> 08:03.218
Oh, you're on.

08:11.594 --> 08:13.893
Hey. You wanted to see me, sir?

08:13.895 --> 08:16.094
Yeah, come on in, Kyle.
You know, I was thinking,

08:16.096 --> 08:17.097
it's been a while since

08:17.099 --> 08:18.866
you and I had dinner,
just the two of us.

08:18.868 --> 08:21.535
Well, actually, you and I
have never had dinner together.

08:21.537 --> 08:23.937
(CHUCKLES) So it's been a long while.

08:23.939 --> 08:26.040
We can change that tonight.

08:26.042 --> 08:28.786
Oh, I'd-I'd love to, but I'm-I'm
meeting with Reverend Paul.

08:28.788 --> 08:30.743
He wants to talk to me about something.

08:30.745 --> 08:33.212
I bet he does.

08:33.215 --> 08:35.216
Yeah. I wonder what's on his mind.

08:35.217 --> 08:38.751
Well, you're gonna think
this sounds crazy, but I think

08:38.753 --> 08:41.121
he wants me to consider
going into the ministry.

08:41.123 --> 08:43.289
Is that even something you'd consider?

08:43.292 --> 08:44.591
- I don't know, you know,
- Yeah.

08:44.593 --> 08:46.059
I'd have to leave Outdoor Man, right?

08:46.061 --> 08:49.596
Not much for a minister
to do in a gun store.

08:49.598 --> 08:51.131
Outdoor Man's the only place

08:51.133 --> 08:53.099
I feel like I've ever really belonged.

08:53.101 --> 08:55.269
And I'm finally starting to
feel really confident in my job.

08:55.271 --> 08:57.237
Plus, you'd have to think about Mandy.

08:57.239 --> 08:58.939
Yeah. Yeah, of course. And it's hard

08:58.941 --> 09:00.808
to imagine Mandy as a minister's wife.

09:00.810 --> 09:04.078
Unless you're one of those
private jet, mansion ministers.

09:04.080 --> 09:05.746
No.

09:05.748 --> 09:07.747
Then it would be hard to imagine.

09:07.749 --> 09:10.317
But the big thing is...

09:10.319 --> 09:13.152
I don't know if I'd be any good at it.

09:13.154 --> 09:15.256
You were great when
you preached on Sunday.

09:15.258 --> 09:18.291
Oh, yeah. Yeah, but that
part doesn't worry me.

09:18.293 --> 09:20.261
There's a lot of other stuff
that a minister has to do.

09:20.263 --> 09:21.995
You know, really important stuff.

09:21.997 --> 09:24.601
And I'm not sure I'd
be good at that part.

09:26.335 --> 09:28.905
I'm glad you confided in me.

09:30.638 --> 09:31.939
I think I can help.

09:31.941 --> 09:34.275
Sit down.

09:34.277 --> 09:36.642
You remember when you first
started working at Outdoor Man?

09:36.644 --> 09:38.178
And you did everything perfectly

09:38.180 --> 09:39.780
and you didn't make any mistakes.

09:39.782 --> 09:41.448
Uh... actually, no.

09:41.450 --> 09:43.283
I remember I made a lot of mistakes.

09:43.285 --> 09:44.818
Right. Right.

09:44.820 --> 09:46.956
Like the time you took all the skis

09:46.958 --> 09:49.457
from the Boise store and
you sent them to Tucson.

09:49.459 --> 09:52.626
- Ugh. "Desert-gate".
- Yeah.

09:52.628 --> 09:55.194
It was a big mistake,
you know. Expensive.

09:55.196 --> 09:57.497
Legendary in the retail business.

09:57.499 --> 09:59.867
That story goes over and...
but it was just a mistake.

09:59.869 --> 10:01.904
Yeah. See, I'm worried
something like that might happen

10:01.906 --> 10:02.969
if I became a minister.

10:02.971 --> 10:04.871
Well, you can rest easy.

10:04.873 --> 10:06.276
Because it will.

10:08.463 --> 10:11.978
Listen. But if you happen
to send two poor souls to...

10:11.980 --> 10:14.548
"the wrong store",

10:14.550 --> 10:16.817
that's just part of the
cost of doing business.

10:16.819 --> 10:18.651
(CHUCKLES)

10:18.653 --> 10:20.687
- Never thought about it that way.
- Nah, nah, nah.

10:20.689 --> 10:24.080
That's why it's always good
to have a trusted advisor.

10:24.082 --> 10:26.244
Yeah. All right.

10:26.246 --> 10:27.530
- Thanks. This helped.
- Yeah, great.

10:27.532 --> 10:29.729
- All right, I should go.
- Okay. (WHISPERING): Yes.

10:29.731 --> 10:31.332
(NORMAL VOICE): When you
talk to the reverend, tell him

10:31.334 --> 10:33.232
our old friend Johnny said hi.

10:33.234 --> 10:35.305
Johnny Walker.

10:40.709 --> 10:43.313
(PANTING)

10:45.721 --> 10:47.143
- Ah.
- Jen.

10:47.145 --> 10:49.594
- (GRUNTS)
- Jen? Jen?

10:49.596 --> 10:52.520
(SCREAMS)

10:52.522 --> 10:54.387
- I'm late for study group? Oh.
- Yeah.

10:54.389 --> 10:57.089
It's because that thing
is a total time suck.

10:57.091 --> 10:59.059
Oh. Bye!

10:59.061 --> 11:00.560
Yeah. Enjoy real life.

11:00.562 --> 11:02.862
(FORCED CHUCKLE)

11:02.864 --> 11:04.749
- (DOOR CLOSES)
- Where'd you go,

11:04.751 --> 11:06.722
you flesh-eating scum?

11:07.936 --> 11:11.156
Oh, there you are. There you are.

11:11.158 --> 11:14.107
All right, come on. You come
on. Come a little closer.

11:14.109 --> 11:15.541
Ha, ha!

11:15.543 --> 11:18.545
Grenade! (IMITATES EXPLOSION)

11:18.547 --> 11:20.914
Grenade! Grenade!

11:20.916 --> 11:22.717
And flamethrower!

11:22.719 --> 11:24.083
(GRUNTING)

11:24.085 --> 11:28.032
Get some! Get some! Get some!

11:28.034 --> 11:31.091
Hee-ya! Hee-ya!

11:31.093 --> 11:33.096
Ha, ha!

11:37.199 --> 11:39.565
Hello?

11:39.567 --> 11:41.968
What happened? Everything
went black. What?

11:41.970 --> 11:44.905
Oh, what is this? Some
kind of zombie trick?

11:44.907 --> 11:46.607
What?

11:46.609 --> 11:48.074
(GASPS)

11:48.076 --> 11:50.577
Oh, boy, oh, boy. Oh, this is not good.

11:50.579 --> 11:55.612
Oh. Uh... just pick this up right here,

11:55.614 --> 11:57.583
and, uh, just there like that.

11:57.585 --> 12:00.252
Maybe it just needs to sit a minute.

12:00.254 --> 12:02.258
Okay.

12:03.926 --> 12:06.162
It's total time suck!

12:09.284 --> 12:11.140
- (CHUCKLING)
- So, how'd the parking thing go

12:11.142 --> 12:14.101
with, uh, Kyle Anderson,
Human Resources?

12:14.103 --> 12:15.801
Oh. Yeah.

12:15.803 --> 12:17.304
We got it all worked out.

12:17.306 --> 12:19.821
Yeah, we had to. Kyle
said we were on his list.

12:19.823 --> 12:23.611
Yeah. I don't want to be on Kyle's list.

12:23.613 --> 12:26.395
I think Kyle's gonna make
a great HR supervisor.

12:26.397 --> 12:28.420
- Let's raise a glass to Kyle.
- To Kyle.

12:28.422 --> 12:29.650
- To Kyle.
- Yeah.

12:29.652 --> 12:32.255
You low-down, sneaky,

12:32.257 --> 12:34.123
backhanded, rattlesnake bastard.

12:35.691 --> 12:39.015
Well, ministers have
changed since I was a kid.

12:39.017 --> 12:41.288
God is calling Kyle to service,

12:41.290 --> 12:43.029
and you undermined his confidence.

12:43.031 --> 12:44.989
You've torn him from God's embrace.

12:44.991 --> 12:47.157
- Whoa, whoa.
- I don't know all the details,

12:47.159 --> 12:49.024
but... not cool.

12:49.026 --> 12:51.494
Well, God took his shot, I took mine.

12:51.496 --> 12:54.063
Turns out, Kyle sees things my way.

12:54.065 --> 12:58.335
And God is surprisingly
generous in defeat.

12:58.337 --> 13:01.171
What bible are you reading?

13:01.173 --> 13:04.485
Finished with work
and ready for a drink.

13:04.487 --> 13:07.677
What am I talking about? I don't drink.

13:07.679 --> 13:10.849
Well, off to the shelter to wash feet.

13:12.327 --> 13:14.783
Listen, Kyle gave me
a lot of reasons why

13:14.785 --> 13:16.676
he didn't want to go into the ministry.

13:16.678 --> 13:18.946
He likes his job here, he's
finally feeling confident,

13:18.948 --> 13:20.020
and he's certain

13:20.022 --> 13:22.347
that Mandy does not want
to be a minister's wife.

13:22.349 --> 13:24.083
Whoa, whoa. What are you talking about?

13:24.085 --> 13:27.687
Well, apparently, Kyle
was being embraced by God

13:27.689 --> 13:30.923
until your dad broke them up.

13:30.925 --> 13:33.360
Be honest with me.

13:33.362 --> 13:35.260
Is that the life you see for yourself?

13:35.262 --> 13:38.597
Bad coffee? Flat shoes?

13:38.599 --> 13:41.101
(SCOFFS) No, I don't want
to be a minister's wife.

13:41.103 --> 13:42.534
(GROANS)

13:42.536 --> 13:45.038
Super sorry.

13:45.040 --> 13:48.707
But Dad, I-I know that
Kyle wants to be a minister,

13:48.709 --> 13:51.879
and I will do everything he
needs me to do to support that.

13:51.881 --> 13:53.712
I wish your dad felt that way.

13:53.714 --> 13:56.048
I'm just telling you how the kid feels.

13:56.050 --> 13:58.051
And I'd sure hate to lose Kyle,

13:58.053 --> 14:01.053
but he'd make a hell of a minister.

14:01.055 --> 14:04.724
I might even start going
back to church. (CHUCKLES)

14:04.726 --> 14:07.488
Nah.

14:07.490 --> 14:10.382
Well, he got Ed to move his damn car,

14:10.384 --> 14:13.368
so we already know the
kid can work miracles.

14:14.736 --> 14:16.903
You know, just about
everything Kyle does,

14:16.905 --> 14:19.438
he does because he wants
you to be proud of him.

14:19.440 --> 14:21.941
Your support is the
only confidence he needs.

14:21.943 --> 14:24.144
PAUL: He wants this, Mike.

14:24.146 --> 14:26.279
He's just scared.

14:26.281 --> 14:28.447
You need to undo what you did.

14:28.449 --> 14:30.450
So I whupped God...

14:30.452 --> 14:32.751
and now I got to take on me?

14:32.753 --> 14:36.224
Well... finally a fair fight.

14:44.295 --> 14:46.419
I don't know what
happened. It's all black.

14:46.421 --> 14:47.601
Did you drop it?

14:47.603 --> 14:49.302
No. I love this thing.

14:49.304 --> 14:51.607
(WHISPERING): I'd never hurt it.

14:54.843 --> 14:56.676
Hello, ladies. (CHUCKLES)

14:56.678 --> 14:58.443
- KRISTIN: Hi.
- What's, uh... what's going on?

14:58.445 --> 15:00.510
Uh, well, the game is broken.

15:00.512 --> 15:02.615
Do you have any idea how that happened?

15:02.617 --> 15:05.474
Me? How... (SCOFFS) How would I know?

15:05.476 --> 15:06.931
Well, it kind of looks like

15:06.933 --> 15:08.491
someone knocked it off the table.

15:09.524 --> 15:11.157
Oh, shoot.

15:11.159 --> 15:14.003
Yeah, uh, you know what?
Yeah, um, it was me.

15:14.005 --> 15:17.630
I-I was... I was, uh, over
here vacuuming and, um,

15:17.632 --> 15:20.658
I-I had my back to the machine,

15:20.660 --> 15:22.568
you know, which... which was behind me,

15:22.570 --> 15:23.803
- and, uh...
- Mm.

15:23.805 --> 15:25.138
You know, the cord, 'cause cords...

15:25.140 --> 15:26.807
- such a nuisance.
- Right.

15:26.809 --> 15:30.176
Just... well, just knocked
the-the... the thing over.

15:30.178 --> 15:31.979
- Really, Mom?
- Yup.

15:31.981 --> 15:34.784
Yeah. Are you, uh... are you
sure you weren't playing it?

15:34.786 --> 15:38.224
No. No way. No. I live in
the real world, remember?

15:40.188 --> 15:42.522
Oh, shoot. Yeah, you
know what? You know what?

15:42.524 --> 15:45.826
Uh, yeah, I did. I-I put the-the
headset on just for a second,

15:45.828 --> 15:48.528
uh, because I wanted to see

15:48.530 --> 15:51.397
if, uh, the technology would
be useful for other sciences,

15:51.399 --> 15:53.833
like, you know, like
mathematics or astronomy.

15:53.835 --> 15:55.836
Um, higher pursuits

15:55.838 --> 15:59.338
than torching the undead
with a flamethrower.

15:59.340 --> 16:01.644
You can't get a flamethrower

16:01.646 --> 16:03.312
until level seven.

16:04.713 --> 16:07.880
Ryan hasn't even gotten to level seven.

16:07.882 --> 16:10.018
I got to level ten!

16:11.652 --> 16:13.352
Listen, no. No, no, no, listen, listen.

16:13.354 --> 16:15.022
There's an underground military base

16:15.024 --> 16:17.923
that has every kind of
weapon you can imagine.

16:17.925 --> 16:19.655
- Level ten?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:19.657 --> 16:20.860
Yeah, that takes time.

16:20.862 --> 16:23.096
Oh, so much time!

16:23.098 --> 16:26.493
But please, just get the
thing out of my house.

16:26.495 --> 16:28.201
I missed a book club, I forgot to eat.

16:28.203 --> 16:30.769
I-I am... I'm just... I'm
so glad that it's broken.

16:30.771 --> 16:32.743
Oh, oh. Wait.

16:32.745 --> 16:33.907
It, uh... it's not.

16:33.909 --> 16:37.210
Looks like a cord was
just loose on the monitor.

16:37.212 --> 16:39.750
You know, I heard there's a Humvee

16:39.752 --> 16:41.280
with a rocket launcher on level 11.

16:41.282 --> 16:44.349
And-and, you know what? I found
a set of keys on level nine.

16:44.351 --> 16:46.452
I mean, I knew they
had to be for something.

16:46.454 --> 16:48.454
So, what do you say?

16:48.456 --> 16:51.026
One hour, and then I
have to make dinner.

16:55.863 --> 16:57.630
Hey, Kyle, could you
step in here a minute?

16:57.632 --> 17:00.265
I want to ask you something. Thanks.

17:00.267 --> 17:02.069
(EXHALES)

17:02.071 --> 17:04.737
Okay, I don't-I don't really
know how I'm gonna do this,

17:04.739 --> 17:09.141
so you... feel free to
chime in with any ideas.

17:09.143 --> 17:12.146
It's pretty well known
you're a big buttinsky.

17:13.747 --> 17:15.314
Hey, you called me, sir?

17:15.316 --> 17:16.815
Yeah, and you... and you came.

17:16.817 --> 17:19.420
Um... you can go.

17:20.454 --> 17:22.119
Kyle?

17:22.122 --> 17:23.989
Yes? Is there something
you need me to do?

17:23.991 --> 17:25.491
Yes, there is, and, um...

17:25.492 --> 17:27.128
You can go.

17:28.228 --> 17:31.130
- Kyle?
- I am right here.

17:31.132 --> 17:32.431
Why do you keep coming in?

17:32.433 --> 17:33.934
'Cause you keep calling me.

17:33.936 --> 17:36.268
If this is one of your
teaching moments, sir,

17:36.270 --> 17:37.937
can we get to the teaching part?

17:37.939 --> 17:41.274
'Cause I'm getting a
little... throw-uppie.

17:41.276 --> 17:44.643
I called you 'cause I
need you to do something.

17:44.645 --> 17:47.926
And you came before you
knew you could do it.

17:47.928 --> 17:49.148
Why is that?

17:49.150 --> 17:50.683
'Cause if you didn't
think I could do it,

17:50.685 --> 17:52.517
- you wouldn't have called me.
- Yeah.

17:52.519 --> 17:55.789
I think we've arrived
at our teaching moment.

17:55.791 --> 17:57.523
Sit down.

17:57.525 --> 18:01.345
Reverend Paul thinks you're
being called to the ministry.

18:01.347 --> 18:02.629
Do you know what that means?

18:02.631 --> 18:03.963
Definitely.

18:03.965 --> 18:05.364
No. Maybe.

18:05.366 --> 18:07.457
I don't know. Do you?

18:08.937 --> 18:10.939
Ah, boy.

18:13.208 --> 18:15.141
It means nothing.

18:15.143 --> 18:18.511
Oh. That's comforting.

18:18.513 --> 18:20.813
Kyle. I am God.

18:20.815 --> 18:22.715
(KYLE LAUGHS SOFTLY)

18:22.717 --> 18:24.149
He's kidding.

18:24.151 --> 18:26.354
You're kidding, right?

18:28.122 --> 18:30.823
For the teaching moment,
I'm playing the role of God.

18:30.825 --> 18:32.725
And to be quite honest,

18:32.727 --> 18:34.995
it feels so right.

18:34.997 --> 18:37.062
Okay.

18:37.064 --> 18:39.735
If I or God calls you,

18:40.657 --> 18:41.868
what does that mean?

18:41.870 --> 18:44.337
That you already think I can do it.

18:44.339 --> 18:45.670
Right.

18:45.672 --> 18:47.239
Am I ever wrong?

18:47.761 --> 18:50.409
- Are you asking as you or as God?
- (CHUCKLES)

18:50.411 --> 18:53.179
Tomato, tomahto. What's the difference?

18:53.181 --> 18:55.380
God's never wrong.

18:55.382 --> 18:58.685
Well, then what you
got to think about is

18:58.687 --> 19:02.045
forgetting what Reverend
Paul says and what I said.

19:02.047 --> 19:04.393
Do you think God is calling you?

19:06.393 --> 19:08.663
Yes.

19:10.164 --> 19:12.532
Then really all you
got to think about is,

19:12.534 --> 19:14.169
are you gonna answer that call?

19:16.203 --> 19:17.870
I don't know. Um...

19:17.872 --> 19:22.742
What if I mess up, and I
send a bunch of skis to Hell?

19:22.744 --> 19:24.744
It's not your job to be infallible.

19:24.746 --> 19:28.046
That's for God. And for me.

19:28.048 --> 19:29.916
Yes, sir.

19:29.918 --> 19:32.516
Listen, um, you're valuable to me, Kyle.

19:32.518 --> 19:35.455
You always come when I call, but I...

19:35.457 --> 19:38.893
I think there's a bigger
call coming through right now.

19:40.128 --> 19:42.227
Okay.

19:42.229 --> 19:45.398
Kyle?

19:45.400 --> 19:48.137
I am proud of you.

19:50.205 --> 19:52.738
I'm really gonna miss it here.

19:52.740 --> 19:54.474
What? You...

19:54.476 --> 19:56.987
There's many years of study
before you become a minister.

19:56.989 --> 19:58.410
You're gonna be here for quite a while.

19:58.412 --> 20:00.312
Oh, thank God.

20:00.314 --> 20:02.316
You're welcome.

20:09.623 --> 20:11.957
Hey, Mike Baxter here for Outdoor Man.

20:11.959 --> 20:14.427
When I was a young guy
trying to find my way,

20:14.429 --> 20:16.094
I heard the call of the wild.

20:16.096 --> 20:18.520
I remember it well...
walking in the woods

20:18.522 --> 20:21.801
and coming eyeball to
eyeball with a 12-point buck.

20:21.803 --> 20:24.771
It was like he was
looking right into my soul.

20:24.773 --> 20:26.969
I didn't realize it was my life calling

20:26.971 --> 20:29.976
until the next day
when I was eating him.

20:29.978 --> 20:33.112
With some oven-browned
potatoes and candied carrots.

20:33.114 --> 20:34.780
Yum, yum, yum.

20:34.782 --> 20:37.617
If you're someone who has a
harder time finding his path,

20:37.619 --> 20:40.986
I recommend the compass. Huh?

20:40.988 --> 20:43.961
Inside, a little magnetic pin spins

20:43.963 --> 20:45.963
according to the
Earth's magnetism, right?

20:45.965 --> 20:49.466
Right now it's pointed at...
look at that... pointed at me,

20:49.468 --> 20:51.602
'cause I'm quite magnetic.

20:51.604 --> 20:54.003
I mean... Is it the eyes?

20:54.005 --> 20:56.307
The intellect, the effortless charisma?

20:56.309 --> 20:57.808
Who am I kidding?

20:57.810 --> 21:00.278
I'm the whole package.

21:00.280 --> 21:01.945
But for mere mortals,

21:01.947 --> 21:04.948
the compass is a great tool
to help you find your way.

21:04.950 --> 21:06.783
The only thing the compass requires

21:06.785 --> 21:09.620
is a belief in true north.

21:09.622 --> 21:11.655
If you trust in that,
there's a whole world

21:11.657 --> 21:13.491
of exciting adventures ahead of you.

21:13.493 --> 21:16.634
Hiking, fishing, or you might
get eaten by a grizzly bear.

21:16.636 --> 21:18.324
Now if being mauled

21:18.326 --> 21:20.798
and slowly eaten alive is
not one of your life goals,

21:20.800 --> 21:25.302
I also recommend Outdoor
Man bear repellent.

21:25.304 --> 21:26.837
Which should be applied

21:26.839 --> 21:30.474
the way Democrats raise
taxes... liberally.

21:30.476 --> 21:33.210
I choke on the word.

21:33.212 --> 21:34.645
Take care out there.

21:34.647 --> 21:37.384
Happy trails. Baxter out.

21:38.950 --> 21:40.484
