00:30.371 --> 00:32.702
Long time, Rick.

00:55.395 --> 00:58.459
Richard,
you look positively ghastly.

00:58.479 --> 00:59.999
Good morning to you, too,
mother.

01:00.033 --> 01:01.734
No, no, no. I'm speaking
as a concerned mother.

01:01.768 --> 01:03.375
Are you sure you're not
coming down with anything?

01:03.395 --> 01:04.937
Not at all. Never better.

01:04.971 --> 01:06.739
Well, good.
Then my work here is done.

01:06.773 --> 01:08.740
I'm off to see some open houses.

01:08.774 --> 01:11.677
Hopefully to find
the apartment of my dreams. Ta!

01:11.711 --> 01:13.011
Bye.

01:13.045 --> 01:15.247
- Ta!
- Bye.

01:15.281 --> 01:17.382
Ah, thank you.

01:17.417 --> 01:18.417
Mm-hmm.

01:19.429 --> 01:21.075
Mmm. Is Alexis gone, too?

01:21.095 --> 01:23.121
Yeah. She had
an early-morning class.

01:23.155 --> 01:24.155
[Sips]

01:24.620 --> 01:26.725
So, you were restless again
last night.

01:26.759 --> 01:27.959
What's going on?

01:27.993 --> 01:29.629
Nothing.

01:29.649 --> 01:32.130
Babe, you keep saying that,
and it keeps getting worse.

01:32.164 --> 01:34.365
You were whimpering
in your sleep.

01:34.399 --> 01:36.467
It's been every night
for a week.

01:36.501 --> 01:38.970
So, come on. Talk to me.

01:39.589 --> 01:41.372
It's just a dream.

01:41.406 --> 01:43.771
So it's a recurring dream?

01:44.735 --> 01:46.711
Okay. About what?

01:47.688 --> 01:50.114
About when I went missing,
I think.

01:50.610 --> 01:53.751
And so why didn't
you want to tell me about it?

01:54.380 --> 01:56.487
Probably because I didn't
want to make a big deal of it.

01:56.521 --> 01:59.422
But it is a big deal. You lost
two months of your life.

01:59.457 --> 02:01.623
And you're dreaming
about it now?

02:01.643 --> 02:03.955
- I don't think you should ignore this.
- <i>I</i> do.

02:03.975 --> 02:06.230
Come on.
Everything is perfect right now.

02:06.264 --> 02:09.389
You and I are in a great place.
Everyone else is.

02:09.408 --> 02:11.135
I mean,
why go turning over stones

02:11.169 --> 02:12.302
when the dreams will just
probably just go away?

02:12.336 --> 02:14.738
Except they haven't gone away.
They're just getting worse.

02:14.772 --> 02:16.406
Look at you.
You're stressed-out.

02:16.440 --> 02:17.574
You're exhausted.

02:17.608 --> 02:20.510
You haven't written a word in a week.
[Mug thuds]

02:20.544 --> 02:23.878
Look, a-at least consider
seeing someone.

02:25.541 --> 02:28.050
I know somebody
who may be able to help.

02:30.187 --> 02:31.059
[Sighs]

02:31.079 --> 02:33.422
Have you ever sought therapy
before, Mr. Castle?

02:33.456 --> 02:34.657
Well, if you'd met my mother,

02:34.691 --> 02:37.046
you'd know
the answer would be yes,

02:37.066 --> 02:39.926
but, uh, by my nature,
I try to avoid introspection.

02:40.144 --> 02:43.365
Well, let's get started.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.768
What <i>can</i> you tell me
about your missing time?

02:45.803 --> 02:47.536
[Sighs] Not much.

02:47.570 --> 02:50.339
The last thing I remember,
I was driving to my wedding.

02:50.373 --> 02:51.940
[Engine revs, tires squeal]

02:51.974 --> 02:53.776
A black S.U.V. started chasing me.

02:53.810 --> 02:55.797
Then I was forced off the road.

02:56.294 --> 02:57.513
Two months later,

02:57.547 --> 03:00.809
they found me in the middle
of the Atlantic ocean.

03:00.829 --> 03:03.018
I had been exposed
to dengue fever.

03:03.052 --> 03:08.023
I had a bullet scar with
no recollection how I got it,

03:08.057 --> 03:09.357
no memory of anything.

03:09.391 --> 03:10.992
I tracked down
a man named Jenkins,

03:11.027 --> 03:12.560
who was involved somehow.

03:12.594 --> 03:14.562
He, uh...

03:14.596 --> 03:18.033
He told me the reason
I couldn't remember.

03:18.067 --> 03:20.468
And you said
you didn't want to remember.

03:20.502 --> 03:23.404
We went to great lengths
to make sure that you didn't.

03:23.439 --> 03:26.013
Carter: And is it still the case
that you don't want to remember?

03:26.033 --> 03:27.676
No.

03:29.060 --> 03:34.065
I-I've tried
to put it behind me,

03:34.085 --> 03:36.851
but it haunts me.

03:36.885 --> 03:38.485
Not a day goes by I don't wonder

03:38.519 --> 03:41.421
where I was, what I saw...

03:41.456 --> 03:43.740
What I did.

03:44.517 --> 03:48.559
Is it possible
my memories are coming back?

03:48.792 --> 03:51.332
Well, dreams can be memories.

03:51.366 --> 03:53.099
But more often
they're symbolic...

03:53.133 --> 03:56.102
metaphoric expressions
of an issue or problem.

03:56.136 --> 03:58.513
You're also a writer...
a creative person.

03:58.533 --> 04:01.341
This could mean your mind
is building a narrative

04:01.376 --> 04:04.611
to fill a two-month void.

04:04.645 --> 04:05.967
[Inhales sharply]

04:05.987 --> 04:08.415
I want to understand
these dreams...

04:08.449 --> 04:12.551
what they mean and, uh...
If they're real.

04:12.586 --> 04:15.278
Well, we could put you
in a relaxed state,

04:15.298 --> 04:18.291
try to revisit the experience.

04:18.325 --> 04:19.892
Hypnosis?

04:19.927 --> 04:24.684
You have a pen and paper
if you wish to take notes.

04:24.704 --> 04:29.363
You may open your eyes
and awaken at any time.

04:29.383 --> 04:32.104
Are you ready to begin,
Mr. Castle?

04:32.138 --> 04:33.973
Yeah.

04:34.741 --> 04:39.311
Go back to the first image
you can recall of your dream.

04:40.299 --> 04:42.547
What do you see?

04:43.321 --> 04:45.550
[Inhales deeply]
I'm asleep on a boat.

04:45.584 --> 04:47.099
On the ocean.

04:47.119 --> 04:49.254
[Water lapping]

04:49.289 --> 04:51.256
Man: <i>Long time, Rick.</i>

04:51.291 --> 04:53.223
There's a man there.
He says hi to me.

04:53.243 --> 04:56.761
[Echoing] Long time, Rick.

04:56.796 --> 04:58.397
He knows me.

04:58.431 --> 04:59.297
Do you know <i>him?</i>

04:59.331 --> 05:03.000
He's familiar,
but I-I can't... place him.

05:03.035 --> 05:05.236
Wow.

05:05.270 --> 05:07.672
This really works.

05:08.342 --> 05:10.341
Okay, there's something
familiar.

05:10.375 --> 05:11.208
A trophy.

05:11.243 --> 05:12.610
[Applause]
[Camera shutter clicks]

05:12.645 --> 05:14.379
For some kind of sport?

05:14.550 --> 05:17.214
Maybe. I-I can't tell.

05:17.768 --> 05:20.651
Now someone's firing a pistol.

05:21.280 --> 05:23.092
I see blood.
[Groaning]

05:23.112 --> 05:25.032
There's a man on the floor.

05:25.052 --> 05:29.298
He's been shot. He's dying.

05:30.162 --> 05:31.695
I'm there, too.

05:31.729 --> 05:33.530
I'm wearing camouflage paint.

05:33.565 --> 05:35.699
I'm trying to help him, but...

05:35.733 --> 05:38.502
Can you see
where you are right now?

05:38.536 --> 05:40.671
[Metal rattling]
In a storage shed.

05:40.705 --> 05:44.207
But it seems like
everything is moving.

05:46.744 --> 05:48.078
[Clatter]

05:51.648 --> 05:53.516
I'm in a truck. [Engine revs]

05:53.550 --> 05:55.385
We're in the jungle.

05:56.170 --> 05:57.687
And there's someone chasing us.

05:57.721 --> 05:59.956
[Engine revs]

06:03.227 --> 06:05.087
They're shooting at us.

06:06.597 --> 06:08.397
[Gunfire]

06:11.041 --> 06:14.884
There's a blond man in a truck.

06:15.244 --> 06:16.639
He's leading the charge.

06:16.673 --> 06:18.179
[Indistinct shouting] Faster!

06:18.199 --> 06:20.504
- A military truck?
- No, it's a civilian truck.

06:20.524 --> 06:22.144
[ <i>Gunfire</i> ] But it has a very...

06:23.409 --> 06:25.062
strange...

06:25.848 --> 06:27.649
license plate.

06:31.921 --> 06:34.723
[Gunfire]

06:35.141 --> 06:36.733
Uh-oh.

06:53.877 --> 06:56.610
So the man you saw
was Chuck Norris?

06:56.645 --> 06:58.048
No, he wasn't...

06:58.068 --> 07:00.182
[Chuckling]
Chuck Norris. Of course not.

07:00.202 --> 07:02.917
I mean,
that would be ridiculous and...

07:02.951 --> 07:03.851
Super-duper cool.

07:03.885 --> 07:06.475
But, no. He...
he looked like Chuck Norris.

07:07.159 --> 07:10.605
Well, this was a very
productive first session,

07:10.625 --> 07:12.760
Mr. Castle,
but I'm afraid our time is up.

07:12.794 --> 07:15.930
Of course. Thank you.

07:15.950 --> 07:18.276
Uh, Dr. Burke, can I, uh...

07:18.296 --> 07:19.753
can I see you again tomorrow?

07:19.773 --> 07:22.369
Well, I'll check,
but I want you to think

07:22.403 --> 07:24.945
about the underlying meaning
of the dream.

07:24.965 --> 07:29.453
Now, don't assume that
the images are actual memories.

07:32.477 --> 07:33.767
Castle: I'm telling you, guys.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.658
There's no doubt in my mind.
They are actual memories.

07:36.678 --> 07:39.394
Even though Dr. Burke
said they might not be?

07:39.414 --> 07:41.555
[Cellphone ringing]
It... Was our first session.

07:41.589 --> 07:43.429
He was just being cautious.
But they felt real.

07:43.440 --> 07:45.458
Because they... they <i>are</i> real.

07:45.493 --> 07:47.960
So you were in jungle combat?
With Chuck Norris.

07:47.995 --> 07:49.763
Ryan: Like "Missing in Action"?

07:49.797 --> 07:52.532
The movie he did about
rescuing P.O.W.S from Vietnam?

07:52.566 --> 07:54.566
Uh, only it wasn't Chuck Norris,
it wasn't a movie,

07:54.568 --> 07:57.270
- and I wasn't in Vietnam.
- You got that right.

07:57.305 --> 07:59.472
Because the license plate
that Tory is checking on...

07:59.507 --> 08:01.540
the one I saw...
it had arabic characters.

08:01.574 --> 08:04.376
Okay, so an arabic-speaking
country with a jungle?

08:04.411 --> 08:07.047
Um... Yemen... Somalia.

08:07.067 --> 08:07.905
Yeah, I guess so.

08:07.925 --> 08:10.665
We'll know more when we track down
that Chuck Norris look-alike.

08:10.685 --> 08:12.215
How do you plan on doing that?

08:12.235 --> 08:14.353
That military skull tattoo
I told you about.

08:14.387 --> 08:16.706
That could help I.D. him, right?

08:18.325 --> 08:19.952
We'll see what we can find out.

08:20.163 --> 08:23.329
But it's a long shot at best.

08:26.766 --> 08:29.535
I know this seems impossible.

08:29.569 --> 08:31.403
A lot of our cases do at first.

08:31.438 --> 08:32.961
There's something there, Castle,

08:32.981 --> 08:35.073
so we'll just follow it
and see where it leads.

08:35.107 --> 08:37.042
I got something
on that license plate.

08:37.553 --> 08:39.409
It turns out, this isn't arabic.

08:39.445 --> 08:41.880
These are letters
in the thai alphabet.

08:41.914 --> 08:42.938
What does it mean?

08:42.957 --> 08:45.250
That the license plate
was registered in Chiang Mai,

08:45.284 --> 08:47.992
a province in northern Thailand.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.222
I was in Thailand,

08:51.256 --> 08:54.225
getting shot at
with Chuck Norris?

09:06.777 --> 09:08.593
Kate, are you awake?

09:12.050 --> 09:13.918
Alexis, hey. Um...

09:15.146 --> 09:16.319
What's... what's wrong?

09:16.353 --> 09:18.354
Sorry. I have an exam,

09:18.389 --> 09:21.124
but I didn't want to
leave dad like this.

09:21.158 --> 09:24.454
He's kind of gone off
the deep end about Thailand.

09:41.692 --> 09:44.147
Hey. Were you up <i>all</i> night?

09:44.181 --> 09:46.916
I'm, uh, researching
armed conflicts

09:46.950 --> 09:49.985
in northern Thailand
during the time I was missing.

09:50.019 --> 09:52.360
Somehow, I must have been
part of one of them.

09:52.380 --> 09:53.689
You find anything?

09:53.723 --> 09:56.492
No, not yet. But I will.

09:56.812 --> 09:59.695
You want to take a break,
maybe get some breakfast?

09:59.729 --> 10:04.266
No, not until I figure this out.
I was there, Kate. I was there.

10:04.300 --> 10:06.501
I was shot at,
which explains my bullet scar.

10:06.535 --> 10:08.670
I was exposed to dengue fever,

10:08.704 --> 10:11.018
a disease that's prevalent
in the region.

10:11.038 --> 10:12.883
Everything fits.

10:14.210 --> 10:17.545
But, Castle, why would you be
abducted on our wedding day

10:17.580 --> 10:19.822
and end up in Thailand?

10:20.686 --> 10:22.183
Worst bachelor party ever?

10:23.198 --> 10:24.683
You know,
maybe Dr. Burke is right.

10:24.703 --> 10:26.354
Maybe those images
that you saw in your dream

10:26.388 --> 10:28.189
are not really your memories.

10:28.223 --> 10:30.191
Oh, no. They're memories.
They're memories.

10:30.225 --> 10:32.888
And you said follow them
wherever they go,

10:32.908 --> 10:34.963
and this is where they go...
Thailand.

10:34.997 --> 10:37.402
This is all about Thailand.

10:37.422 --> 10:40.685
Okay, well, why don't we take
a step back from Thailand.

10:40.705 --> 10:42.870
Why don't we take a look
at some of the other images,

10:42.904 --> 10:44.638
like the... the trophy.

10:44.852 --> 10:46.474
Eh, the trophy's irrelevant.

10:46.508 --> 10:48.608
Well, it was in your dream
for a reason.

10:48.745 --> 10:50.411
You said it was familiar.

10:50.445 --> 10:52.130
In what way?
What did it look like?

10:52.150 --> 10:54.948
Cheap. You know, something
that you would give a child.

10:54.983 --> 10:58.907
Okay. So could it have been,
um, an award that Alexis won?

10:58.927 --> 11:00.453
Maybe something that you won?

11:00.488 --> 11:02.556
Something for writing?

11:04.792 --> 11:06.292
[Applause]

11:09.426 --> 11:11.297
I know what it is.

11:21.624 --> 11:22.909
This is it.

11:22.943 --> 11:25.110
This is the trophy. This is...

11:25.145 --> 11:28.447
I, um... I won this in a...
in a debate competition

11:28.481 --> 11:29.668
back at faircroft prep.

11:29.688 --> 11:33.361
- Why would that be in your dream?
- I don't know, but...

11:35.960 --> 11:37.826
Wait a minute.

11:39.793 --> 11:41.360
Phillip Bartlett.

11:41.394 --> 11:42.861
Who's Phillip Bartlett?

11:42.895 --> 11:45.594
Phillip Bartlett and I,
we tied for first place.

11:45.614 --> 11:47.466
We shared this trophy.

11:47.500 --> 11:48.667
That man in my dream,

11:48.701 --> 11:50.669
the one who says hello,
it was him.

11:50.703 --> 11:53.972
I mean, he's my age now, but...

11:55.375 --> 11:56.918
Phillip Bartlett.

11:56.938 --> 11:58.777
Long time, Rick.

11:58.811 --> 12:00.437
He's a part of this.

12:01.581 --> 12:02.981
If I'm gonna track him down,

12:03.015 --> 12:05.703
I'm gonna need you
to do a background check on him.

12:07.879 --> 12:09.888
Okay, so now it's Chuck Norris

12:09.922 --> 12:11.890
<i>and</i> some old buddy
from high school?

12:11.924 --> 12:15.659
Come on, guys. I'm just asking
you to run Phillip Bartlett.

12:15.694 --> 12:17.586
Look, Castle needs to know
what's going on.

12:17.606 --> 12:18.880
What if these leads go nowhere?

12:18.900 --> 12:21.165
Then he needs to know that,
as well.

12:22.287 --> 12:23.634
Excuse me. Tory!

12:23.668 --> 12:26.571
Hey, any more news
on that license plate?

12:26.605 --> 12:28.406
A little...
the plate was registered

12:28.440 --> 12:32.126
to a thai freight company that
went out of business in 1987.

12:32.146 --> 12:33.577
1987?

12:33.612 --> 12:35.412
Uh, how would Castle
see it on a truck

12:35.446 --> 12:36.446
almost 30 years later?

12:36.447 --> 12:38.415
I don't know.

12:38.449 --> 12:41.260
It's possible
the plate was stolen, or...

12:41.280 --> 12:42.648
Or what?

12:43.354 --> 12:45.522
I ran an image search
of the plate.

12:45.556 --> 12:48.325
Similar license plates appeared
in several action films,

12:48.359 --> 12:50.823
during car-chase sequences.

12:50.843 --> 12:54.156
Ah. So you think he might
have seen it in a film.

12:54.176 --> 12:55.532
Maybe.

12:57.768 --> 13:01.058
Martha. Hey. Uh, what's...
what's going on?

13:01.369 --> 13:02.849
[Sighs]

13:04.602 --> 13:07.409
Richard is completely obsessed,

13:07.444 --> 13:09.012
and I am concerned about him.

13:09.046 --> 13:10.346
I know. Me too.

13:10.380 --> 13:13.722
He never spoke to me
about the missing time.

13:13.742 --> 13:16.418
I thought he was at peace
with it. Didn't you?

13:16.453 --> 13:18.420
Well, I guess
the dreams made him realize

13:18.455 --> 13:20.789
that he <i>wasn't</i> at peace.

13:21.607 --> 13:23.259
He chose to forget
those two months.

13:23.293 --> 13:26.407
He must have had a very good
reason for wanting to do that.

13:26.427 --> 13:29.398
I think looking into this
is a bad idea.

13:29.432 --> 13:31.930
Martha, I-I don't think that
this is a choice for him.

13:31.950 --> 13:34.270
I think that
he needs to know the truth.

13:34.304 --> 13:36.205
What if he never
finds out the truth?

13:36.239 --> 13:38.190
What if he never learns
anything?

13:38.210 --> 13:40.575
Or worse, what if he finds out
something awful?

13:40.609 --> 13:42.544
I'll be with him.
Wherever this leads.

13:42.578 --> 13:45.996
And I promise you I am not
gonna let him go too far.

13:48.484 --> 13:50.161
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

13:57.693 --> 14:00.094
[High-pitched ringing]

14:05.801 --> 14:08.102
[Echoing] Long time, Rick.

14:08.136 --> 14:10.004
[Ringing continues]

14:10.038 --> 14:12.707
Phil: Long time, Rick.

14:15.524 --> 14:17.017
Phil Bartlett.
Thank you for coming.

14:17.037 --> 14:19.279
Well, I knew
it was only a matter of time

14:19.314 --> 14:21.082
before I'd hear from you.

14:21.116 --> 14:22.570
You were expecting my call?

14:22.590 --> 14:25.986
Of course I was.
And I'm - I'm here for you.

14:26.021 --> 14:28.456
Oh, thank God.
What a relief. Okay.

14:28.476 --> 14:30.939
I need to talk to you
about Thailand.

14:31.361 --> 14:32.784
What do you know about Thailand?

14:32.804 --> 14:35.596
I was there. I saw you.

14:36.440 --> 14:38.156
You're not supposed to know.

14:38.176 --> 14:41.535
Nobody is.
And you can't tell anyone.

14:42.272 --> 14:44.168
I won't. I won't. I promise.

14:45.150 --> 14:48.010
As long as you tell me
your version of what happened.

14:48.030 --> 14:49.209
I can't do that.

14:49.243 --> 14:51.077
I need to know what you know.

14:54.954 --> 14:57.717
What I'm about to say
can never be repeated.

14:57.752 --> 14:59.518
Understood.

15:00.239 --> 15:03.472
I was in Thailand to attend
an investment conference.

15:04.144 --> 15:07.154
We hit this Bangkok nightclub.

15:07.728 --> 15:09.828
Oh, she was so beautiful.

15:10.661 --> 15:14.066
I thought she was a woman.
I swear to God.

15:14.628 --> 15:16.082
Wait, what?

15:16.400 --> 15:19.670
Um, no. I need you to tell me
about Chiang Mai.

15:21.349 --> 15:23.341
Uh... I was never in Chiang Mai.

15:23.376 --> 15:25.543
I was in Bangkok.
You said you saw me?

15:25.578 --> 15:28.480
Yeah, but...
no, I-I didn't see <i>that.</i>

15:30.565 --> 15:32.817
I think it's best that
we never speak of this again.

15:32.851 --> 15:35.153
Wait, no. No. You were there.
I know you were.

15:35.173 --> 15:36.672
Look, I don't know what kind
of game you're playing here...

15:36.692 --> 15:38.390
It's not a game.

15:38.424 --> 15:40.851
I-I saw our trophy...
the one we won for debate club.

15:40.871 --> 15:42.661
You were expecting my call.

15:42.695 --> 15:44.429
Why would you
be expecting my call?

15:44.463 --> 15:45.297
Phillip Bartlett...

15:45.331 --> 15:47.865
Bartlett-Braddock
wealth management.

15:47.900 --> 15:49.596
I wanted to take you on
as a client.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.368
Now not so much.

15:51.403 --> 15:53.404
You know, for the record, I was
never a debate geek, all right?

15:53.438 --> 15:55.254
I played lacrosse.

15:56.622 --> 15:58.018
[Door opens]

15:58.038 --> 15:59.476
It doesn't make any sense.

15:59.511 --> 16:01.873
He has to be part of this.
He was in the dream.

16:01.880 --> 16:03.414
Except we checked him out.

16:03.448 --> 16:04.515
The first and only time

16:04.549 --> 16:07.551
Phillip Bartlett traveled
to Thailand was a month ago,

16:07.586 --> 16:09.720
and there's nothing that
connects him to all of this.

16:09.754 --> 16:10.988
I even called Faircroft Prep.

16:11.022 --> 16:14.057
They confirmed Phillip Bartlett
was not on the debate team.

16:14.092 --> 16:15.516
I didn't share first place
with anyone.

16:15.536 --> 16:18.028
Uh, babe, maybe you're taking
this whole dream thing

16:18.062 --> 16:18.996
too literally.

16:19.030 --> 16:21.432
Or maybe you've combined
two memories together.

16:21.452 --> 16:23.468
No. I'm not making this up.

16:25.134 --> 16:27.352
But what if...

16:27.372 --> 16:28.538
What if this is "total recall"?

16:28.572 --> 16:31.742
Not only did they <i>erase</i>
<i>my memories,</i>

16:31.776 --> 16:35.633
but they <i>replaced</i> them
with false memories?

16:35.653 --> 16:36.747
But the false memories

16:36.781 --> 16:37.748
would have to be based
in reality, right?

16:37.782 --> 16:40.049
Otherwise, why would
Phillip Bartlett be in them?

16:40.083 --> 16:43.353
- Uh, Castle, listen to me...
- Detective Beckett? A word?

16:46.990 --> 16:49.192
I've noticed
you've devoted resources

16:49.226 --> 16:52.395
to running a background check
on Phillip Bartlett.

16:52.429 --> 16:55.230
And tracing license plates
in Thailand?

16:55.265 --> 16:57.033
Uh, sir, I was following up

16:57.067 --> 16:59.434
on some new leads
about Castle's disappearance.

16:59.469 --> 17:01.470
In connection to Chuck Norris?

17:02.138 --> 17:04.272
Yeah. It's complicated.

17:04.307 --> 17:08.069
Kate, I know how important
this is to him.

17:08.089 --> 17:10.579
But these leads, are they solid?

17:10.613 --> 17:14.516
Or is Mr. Castle
just grasping at straws?

17:15.653 --> 17:17.170
[Sighs]

17:21.191 --> 17:22.585
Esposito: Yo.

17:23.425 --> 17:26.094
I dug into that tattoo.

17:27.758 --> 17:29.972
That insignia...
that means Delta Force, right?

17:29.992 --> 17:33.434
Yeah. It's also the title
of a Chuck Norris movie.

17:33.826 --> 17:35.497
Yeah. Well, delta
guys don't advertise,

17:35.517 --> 17:38.907
so whoever's wearing that ink
is no longer active duty.

17:38.941 --> 17:41.009
It says here on the banner

17:41.043 --> 17:42.643
that he's out
of the 75th ranger regiment,

17:42.678 --> 17:44.245
3rd battalion, b company.

17:44.279 --> 17:46.040
Now, I checked
with my boy at the Pentagon,

17:46.060 --> 17:48.738
and there's only a handful of
guys with that service history

17:48.758 --> 17:50.865
who match the guy
you said you saw.

17:50.885 --> 17:52.195
Here you go.

17:52.215 --> 17:55.259
Thank you for this, Esposito.
This is great.

17:55.279 --> 17:57.192
So, he will be
in here somewhere.

17:57.226 --> 17:59.260
Yeah, but he's not.

17:59.724 --> 18:02.074
None of those guys
look like Chuck Norris.

18:03.255 --> 18:04.865
You don't believe me, do you?

18:04.899 --> 18:05.966
[Inhales deeply]

18:06.000 --> 18:08.969
For my money, your story
about the missing two months

18:09.003 --> 18:10.771
never added up.

18:11.076 --> 18:12.792
It still doesn't.

18:22.409 --> 18:23.150
This is the guy.

18:23.170 --> 18:25.652
- Come on, Castle.
- No, this is the guy.

18:26.055 --> 18:28.288
That guy looks nothing
like Chuck Norris.

18:28.323 --> 18:29.122
He would with a beard.

18:29.157 --> 18:31.402
And he lives right here
in the city.

18:31.788 --> 18:35.261
His name is Jeff Powers...
honorable discharge in 2009,

18:35.295 --> 18:37.831
then he worked as a contractor
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

18:38.240 --> 18:39.265
This is just the kind of guy

18:39.299 --> 18:41.067
who could be a mercenary
in Thailand.

18:41.101 --> 18:43.837
He was there, Beckett.
He knows what happened.

18:44.471 --> 18:45.839
I hope so, but if he doesn't,

18:45.873 --> 18:47.273
then we need to take a breath

18:47.307 --> 18:48.375
and discuss how to pursue this.

18:48.409 --> 18:51.978
[Knock on door]
Or <i>whethe</i> to pursue it.

18:52.012 --> 18:53.012
That won't be necessary.

18:53.013 --> 18:55.050
All the answers are
right behind this door.

18:57.608 --> 18:59.352
Castle! What are you doing?

18:59.386 --> 19:01.453
It's okay. He knows me.

19:01.488 --> 19:03.289
Jeff Powers?

19:03.323 --> 19:05.457
It's Rick Castle from Thailand.

19:06.425 --> 19:07.292
[TV chatter]
Your door was unlocked.

19:07.326 --> 19:09.445
Just wanted to
ask you a few questions.

19:09.465 --> 19:10.908
Castle.

19:20.370 --> 19:21.887
That's him.

19:23.675 --> 19:25.382
That's the guy in my dream.

19:27.742 --> 19:29.123
Lanie: Well, needless to say,

19:29.143 --> 19:32.073
that G.S.W. to the head
is the likely cause of death.

19:32.093 --> 19:32.968
When did this happen?

19:32.988 --> 19:35.543
Based on liver temp,
about midnight last night.

19:35.563 --> 19:38.440
But I'll know more
once I do a full workup on him.

19:38.460 --> 19:40.700
Castle starts remembering
this guy.

19:40.720 --> 19:43.342
And all of a sudden,
he becomes a homicide victim?

19:43.362 --> 19:44.189
That's kind of weird.

19:44.223 --> 19:47.640
Yeah. It's not just weird.
It's suspicious.

19:49.219 --> 19:51.530
Well, I was hoping to prove
Castle's story was true,

19:51.564 --> 19:52.731
but not like this.

19:52.766 --> 19:54.900
Yeah. Contact the next-of-kin.

19:54.934 --> 19:57.102
Let's find out
what Jeff Powers was into.

19:57.136 --> 19:58.469
Easier said than done.

19:58.504 --> 20:00.471
His parents are dead,
no wife or siblings.

20:00.506 --> 20:03.074
Hoping to track down a friend
or someone he served with.

20:03.109 --> 20:04.276
But I'm on it.

20:04.310 --> 20:06.344
[Camera shutter clicking]

20:10.849 --> 20:12.817
Hey. How you doing?

20:12.851 --> 20:15.252
On the bright side,
at least I'm not crazy.

20:15.287 --> 20:17.722
Yeah, well,
I never thought you were.

20:17.756 --> 20:19.490
Well, <i>I</i> sure thought I was.

20:19.525 --> 20:21.726
You must have had
a few moments of doubt.

20:21.760 --> 20:23.120
Do we have any idea
who killed him?

20:23.128 --> 20:24.896
It's too soon to tell.

20:24.930 --> 20:27.285
But we're gonna get
to the bottom of this.

20:27.521 --> 20:29.633
[Sighs] What if it's my fault?

20:29.667 --> 20:32.078
What if me poking around is
what got him killed?

20:32.098 --> 20:34.071
Castle, how could that
even be possible?

20:34.105 --> 20:35.839
I don't know. Maybe I'm being
followed or watched.

20:35.873 --> 20:37.351
His death cannot be
a coincidence.

20:37.371 --> 20:39.962
Yeah. It doesn't
seem like one, does it?

20:41.980 --> 20:43.380
Well, I may know more
in 20 minutes.

20:43.381 --> 20:45.149
You mean your appointment
with Dr. Burke?

20:45.169 --> 20:46.950
Yeah, if I can remember
about Thailand,

20:46.984 --> 20:49.004
it may help us
solve this murder.

20:50.372 --> 20:51.455
Okay. Keep me close.

20:51.489 --> 20:52.756
Always.

20:53.256 --> 20:55.459
Hey, uh, Beckett?

20:55.493 --> 20:56.986
Hey. Please tell me
we got something.

20:57.006 --> 21:00.398
Well, I did find this...
a cocktail napkin from Exotica.

21:00.418 --> 21:01.824
I take it that's a strip club?

21:01.844 --> 21:03.933
Yeah. And this was
in the victim's pocket.

21:03.968 --> 21:05.701
It could be
where he was last night

21:05.735 --> 21:07.536
before he came home
and wound up dead.

21:07.571 --> 21:09.705
- And it might be where he met our killer.
- Yeah.

21:09.739 --> 21:11.774
I'll see if I can find out
who he spent time with

21:11.808 --> 21:14.043
at, uh, Exotica.

21:14.078 --> 21:16.045
Sure, I know Jeff.
He's a regular.

21:16.080 --> 21:18.361
He's at the club
a few nights a week.

21:18.381 --> 21:20.783
He's nice, always a gentleman.

21:21.134 --> 21:24.386
Fact is, he was there
last night, right?

21:24.420 --> 21:26.154
Was he there with somebody?

21:26.189 --> 21:27.222
Just me.

21:27.256 --> 21:29.825
Ryan: Amber, did you notice
if he talked to anyone,

21:29.860 --> 21:31.627
or left with anyone?
[Chuckles]

21:31.661 --> 21:33.923
Jeff wasn't much
for socializing.

21:33.943 --> 21:35.864
Did he have any friends
that you know of?

21:35.898 --> 21:36.831
Anybody ever stop by the club?

21:36.866 --> 21:38.711
Hmm.

21:38.731 --> 21:41.036
Yeah. One friend did.

21:41.070 --> 21:43.238
- Who?
- Some army buddy.

21:43.272 --> 21:45.474
He came in looking for Jeff.

21:45.508 --> 21:48.043
He was in town, visiting,
and wanted to surprise him,

21:48.077 --> 21:50.045
so he made me swear
not to say anything.

21:50.079 --> 21:51.483
When was this?

21:51.503 --> 21:53.414
Three days ago, maybe?

21:53.448 --> 21:56.029
Ryan: Amber, this army buddy
of Jeff's...

21:56.049 --> 21:57.852
do you think you remember
this guy well enough

21:57.887 --> 21:59.253
to help us out with a sketch?

21:59.287 --> 22:00.722
Sure.

22:00.756 --> 22:03.901
Why? Is something
going on with Jeff?

22:07.831 --> 22:09.448
Castle: It's not working.

22:10.418 --> 22:13.200
I-I-I can't remember
anything new.

22:13.235 --> 22:14.768
I keep coming up
with the same images.

22:14.802 --> 22:16.570
Carter: Let's look at this
another way.

22:16.604 --> 22:19.117
Perhaps the images came to you
for a reason.

22:19.137 --> 22:21.256
- Something triggered them.
- Like what?

22:21.276 --> 22:24.078
You began having this dream
over a week ago.

22:24.098 --> 22:27.848
Did anything unusual occur
on that particular day?

22:27.882 --> 22:29.782
Um... No.

22:29.816 --> 22:32.167
I got up.
I had breakfast with Beckett.

22:32.187 --> 22:35.221
She had to go to court.
Uh, I went to the gym.

22:35.256 --> 22:36.356
And then?

22:36.390 --> 22:37.660
I wrote for a while.

22:37.680 --> 22:40.515
I wanted a change of scenery,

22:40.863 --> 22:43.462
so I took my laptop
to the coffee shop...

22:43.482 --> 22:46.766
There. What did
you just remember?

22:46.800 --> 22:48.601
Just that when
I was at the coffee shop,

22:48.635 --> 22:53.321
I-I got this strange, um, like
a buzzing, ringing in my ears.

22:53.341 --> 22:55.975
Let's go back a week ago
to the coffee shop.

22:56.380 --> 22:59.879
What were you doing
when this buzzing first started?

22:59.913 --> 23:01.610
I was writing.

23:02.231 --> 23:04.450
Or, rather, procrastinating.

23:04.484 --> 23:08.420
I was stuck on a scene,
so I was just people-watching.

23:08.455 --> 23:10.457
[Indistinct conversations]
Anyone you knew?

23:10.477 --> 23:13.258
Or recognized?

23:14.212 --> 23:15.443
No.

23:15.463 --> 23:17.329
No, I don't think so.

23:18.465 --> 23:19.831
Wait a minute. That ringing...

23:19.865 --> 23:22.532
it started when I looked up
at the TV.

23:24.323 --> 23:25.971
What was playing?

23:28.439 --> 23:31.275
Something from the local news.

23:31.310 --> 23:32.677
Darcy: <i>April 15th
is only two days away.</i>

23:32.712 --> 23:34.312
This is the clip
you would have seen.

23:34.346 --> 23:35.346
<i>But, on the bright side,</i>

23:35.347 --> 23:37.014
<i>many post offices
will be open extra late</i>

23:37.048 --> 23:39.010
<i>to accept tax returns
from last-minute filers.</i>

23:39.030 --> 23:40.951
It's just some report
on tax day.

23:40.986 --> 23:42.786
Maybe the buzzing
has nothing to do with this.

23:42.821 --> 23:43.721
- <i>Always file an extension.
- Just keep watching.</i>

23:43.755 --> 23:45.156
There's got to be
something else there.

23:45.190 --> 23:47.291
<i>The federal Plaza,
Church Street,</i>

23:47.326 --> 23:48.859
<i>and Chinatown post offices will all have
extended hours [High-pitched ringing]</i>

23:48.893 --> 23:50.595
Wait. Um, pause it. Pause it.

23:50.629 --> 23:51.762
<i>Of course, the I.R.S...</i>

23:51.796 --> 23:53.463
[beep]

23:56.579 --> 23:58.470
What is it?

23:59.303 --> 24:02.539
Tory, zoom in
on that man right there.

24:02.573 --> 24:04.008
[Keyboard clacking]

24:04.042 --> 24:06.106
[Beeping]

24:06.126 --> 24:07.611
I know him.

24:08.568 --> 24:10.483
He was the one chasing us
in the truck.

24:10.503 --> 24:11.259
Are you sure?

24:11.279 --> 24:13.550
Yes, I'm sure.
He was in Thailand.

24:13.584 --> 24:14.984
Esposito: Yo.

24:15.019 --> 24:17.154
We got our sketch back
of the guy who showed up

24:17.188 --> 24:20.023
at the strip club,
asking for Jeff Powers.

24:23.443 --> 24:25.227
The same man.

24:25.768 --> 24:27.997
First in Thailand,
now in New York.

24:28.032 --> 24:31.812
Whoever he is,
he's at the center of this.

24:33.216 --> 24:35.364
Just catching a glimpse
of his face

24:35.384 --> 24:36.284
is what started all this.

24:36.318 --> 24:38.801
It's what triggered my dreams.
But who is he?

24:38.821 --> 24:40.522
What else
do you remember about him?

24:40.557 --> 24:42.146
Uh, he was dressed
like a soldier.

24:42.166 --> 24:43.992
You said he was yelling
at his men?

24:44.027 --> 24:45.537
In what language?

24:46.362 --> 24:48.296
[Gunfire] Faster! Faster!

24:48.330 --> 24:49.497
He was speaking English.

24:49.532 --> 24:52.100
So, was he American? British?

24:52.134 --> 24:53.668
No. I-I think he had an accent.

24:53.702 --> 24:55.303
Esposito: So European, maybe.

24:55.337 --> 24:57.705
I'll run his photo through
interpol, see if they know him.

24:57.739 --> 24:59.374
And I'll have unis canvass
where that video was taken

24:59.408 --> 25:01.124
and see if anyone in that
neighborhood recognizes him.

25:01.144 --> 25:03.847
Thanks, guys.
Okay, what else can we do?

25:03.867 --> 25:07.062
Castle, you can't be a part
of this. Not anymore.

25:07.082 --> 25:08.149
What do you mean? I have to be.

25:08.183 --> 25:09.584
We don't know this man's agenda.

25:09.618 --> 25:11.018
No, no, Beckett. I <i>need</i> to be...

25:11.038 --> 25:13.020
What you need to do is
go back to the loft

25:13.054 --> 25:14.054
and stay there.

25:14.055 --> 25:15.923
Now, I've assigned
a security detail to you.

25:15.957 --> 25:18.202
- Why would I be a target?
- I don't know. And neither do you.

25:18.222 --> 25:20.161
But he was shooting at you
in Thailand.

25:20.195 --> 25:21.361
And he just killed Jeff Powers,

25:21.396 --> 25:23.697
your Chuck Norris look-alike.

25:23.731 --> 25:26.580
Now, l.T. is gonna
drive you home.

25:26.600 --> 25:28.110
And if I refuse?

25:28.130 --> 25:30.570
Then he'll drive you home
in handcuffs.

25:30.605 --> 25:33.626
Just for the record?
Extremely bitter.

25:34.459 --> 25:36.056
I'll call you
if we find anything.

25:36.076 --> 25:37.678
[Cellphone ringing]

25:38.212 --> 25:39.635
[Beep]

25:39.655 --> 25:41.047
Beckett.

25:41.081 --> 25:42.849
Lanie, hey. What did you find?

25:42.883 --> 25:46.569
Well, for one thing, Mr. Powers'
blood work came back.

25:46.707 --> 25:48.789
He had antibodies
for dengue fever.

25:48.823 --> 25:50.766
Just like Castle.

25:50.786 --> 25:52.359
Similar strain, too.

25:52.393 --> 25:55.698
But the main attraction is
what I found in the man's mouth.

25:57.426 --> 26:00.200
Huh. Rather,
what you <i>didn't</i> find.

26:00.682 --> 26:02.268
What happened to his teeth?

26:02.303 --> 26:04.144
They were pried out...
eight of them...

26:04.164 --> 26:06.084
shortly before he died.

26:06.104 --> 26:08.499
So Powers was tortured first.
Revenge?

26:09.182 --> 26:10.976
Or the killer
wanted information.

26:11.010 --> 26:12.978
Did he leave
any evidence behind?

26:13.012 --> 26:14.547
I'm afraid not.

26:14.581 --> 26:15.948
Looks like he wore latex gloves.

26:15.982 --> 26:18.845
I found traces of talc
in the victim's mouth.

26:20.328 --> 26:21.577
The gloves
would have been bloody.

26:21.597 --> 26:22.755
The killer would
have to get rid of them.

26:22.789 --> 26:25.090
They could have
his prints or DNA on them.

26:25.124 --> 26:27.732
Right, but those gloves could be anywhere.
How would we find them?

26:27.752 --> 26:29.493
The department has bloodhounds.

26:30.763 --> 26:32.931
Call the K-9 unit,
have them deploy bloodhounds

26:32.966 --> 26:35.767
to search near
Powers' apartment building.

26:35.801 --> 26:37.970
[Siren wailing]

26:38.004 --> 26:40.339
[Indistinct conversations]

26:40.373 --> 26:41.573
Thanks.

26:41.607 --> 26:42.774
[Sighs]

26:42.808 --> 26:43.975
Find the gloves yet?

26:44.009 --> 26:45.009
Oh, nothing so far.

26:45.043 --> 26:47.178
Yeah, not with my team either.

26:47.212 --> 26:48.346
Well, the dogs
may still come through.

26:48.381 --> 26:49.381
I'm not so sure.

26:49.382 --> 26:50.248
For all we know,

26:50.282 --> 26:51.315
the killer didn't even
toss his gloves.

26:51.350 --> 26:54.252
So what? He's just walking
around with bloody latex?

26:54.286 --> 26:56.966
Nah. He could have put them in a
ziploc bag, could have burned them.

26:57.225 --> 26:59.357
Yeah, the thing of it is,
even if we find the gloves

26:59.392 --> 27:02.326
and get the killer's prints
or DNA and we do I.D. this guy,

27:02.361 --> 27:04.362
he's probably long gone by now.

27:04.396 --> 27:07.024
- Based on what?
- Well, if he wanted information,

27:07.044 --> 27:08.444
he probably got it
from Jeff Powers,

27:08.466 --> 27:09.800
yanking out all of his teeth.

27:09.834 --> 27:13.004
No. A soldier like Powers?
His training?

27:13.038 --> 27:15.025
No, he'd die
before he spilled his guts.

27:15.045 --> 27:16.473
I hope you're wrong about that.

27:16.508 --> 27:19.373
'Cause if our killer
was after information,

27:19.858 --> 27:21.978
he may think Castle has it.

27:31.159 --> 27:34.524
Hey. I thought you said you were
staying at a friend's tonight.

27:34.558 --> 27:37.627
No. Uh, <i>you</i> said
I was staying at a friend's.

27:37.661 --> 27:39.829
Oh. Well, then,
you should have listened.

27:39.863 --> 27:42.232
I wanted to be here with you.

27:42.266 --> 27:45.668
I know this isn't
just another case.

27:46.683 --> 27:50.239
Oh, yeah. Listen...
yesterday morning in my office.

27:50.273 --> 27:54.477
I know I was a little Doc Brown,
"Back to the Future."

27:54.511 --> 27:56.679
[Sighs]

27:56.964 --> 27:59.688
What really went on
in Thailand, dad?

28:00.048 --> 28:01.183
I know you must have a theory.

28:01.217 --> 28:03.920
Uh, believe me, I have dozens.

28:03.954 --> 28:06.099
Which one scares you the most?

28:08.437 --> 28:11.160
I don't need you to protect me.

28:11.194 --> 28:12.494
I'm not a kid anymore.

28:12.528 --> 28:14.896
I'm not afraid
to hear the truth.

28:14.931 --> 28:17.222
That's right.
You aren't, are you?

28:17.533 --> 28:19.668
Why not let me in?

28:23.427 --> 28:25.957
I wanted to forget everything.

28:26.943 --> 28:31.143
So in my darkest moments,
I wonder if I...

28:31.963 --> 28:33.515
did something terrible.

28:33.549 --> 28:35.049
I know you.

28:35.084 --> 28:37.418
You would never do anything bad.

28:38.430 --> 28:41.222
I could never leave
the love of my life,

28:41.256 --> 28:43.938
desert her and you
for two months.

28:44.734 --> 28:46.693
And somehow I did.

28:46.727 --> 28:49.262
[Cellphone rings]

28:49.297 --> 28:50.364
[Beep]

28:51.558 --> 28:53.033
Castle. [Elevator bell dings]

28:53.747 --> 28:54.801
How did we I.D. This guy?

28:54.835 --> 28:56.603
By way of a bloodhound
named Cujo.

28:56.637 --> 28:59.473
Cujo sniffed out
a paper bag in a storm drain

28:59.507 --> 29:01.308
about four blocks away
from the crime scene.

29:01.342 --> 29:03.109
The bag contained latex gloves.

29:03.143 --> 29:04.276
And we're sure these gloves
belong to the killer?

29:04.311 --> 29:06.713
Yeah. The bag
had teeth in it, too.

29:06.747 --> 29:09.115
In any case,
CSU was able to pull prints.

29:09.149 --> 29:12.318
We got a hit off ECRIS,
European fingerprint network.

29:12.352 --> 29:13.756
So the killer's European?

29:13.776 --> 29:17.256
He's Russian. Ilya Golovkin.

29:17.290 --> 29:18.991
Castle,
does that name sound familiar?

29:19.026 --> 29:20.393
No. Who is he?

29:20.427 --> 29:21.593
Esposito:
He served in Spetsnaz...

29:21.628 --> 29:23.929
Russian special forces...
then moved on to the former KGB.

29:23.963 --> 29:25.197
The Russians are behind this?

29:25.232 --> 29:28.434
Mm, doubtful. He left Russia
five years ago and disappeared.

29:28.468 --> 29:30.436
Since then, word is
that he's been responsible

29:30.470 --> 29:32.338
for over two dozen
assassinations.

29:32.372 --> 29:34.106
Ryan: Including politicians,
dissident journalists,

29:34.141 --> 29:37.075
protected witnesses,
even a Vatican banker.

29:37.109 --> 29:38.043
Golovkin's the guy you call

29:38.077 --> 29:39.945
when you have a job
that no one else can do.

29:39.979 --> 29:41.947
Castle, if Golovkin is involved,
then whatever's going on,

29:41.981 --> 29:44.706
whatever you were a part of,
it's something big.

29:52.421 --> 29:53.954
Here you go.

29:54.284 --> 29:56.724
How do we even track down
a guy like Golovkin?

29:56.759 --> 29:58.125
We called in reinforcements.

29:58.159 --> 29:59.727
We're coordinating with the FBI.

29:59.762 --> 30:02.129
Every state and federal
law-enforcement agency

30:02.163 --> 30:03.197
is looking for this guy.

30:03.231 --> 30:05.800
And when we find him,
you will have your answers.

30:05.834 --> 30:08.035
He's the only person
who knows the truth.

30:08.069 --> 30:10.237
[High-pitched ringing]

30:10.272 --> 30:12.961
There's at least
one other person who knows.

30:14.846 --> 30:17.349
I need to see Powers' file.

30:22.572 --> 30:25.043
Exactly what
are you hoping to find?

30:25.063 --> 30:27.821
We already went over
what little there is on Powers.

30:27.855 --> 30:29.623
Yes, but you were looking
for his killer.

30:29.657 --> 30:32.459
I'm looking for this guy.

30:33.494 --> 30:35.395
Jenkins is
the mastermind behind this,

30:35.430 --> 30:36.797
or mastermind-adjacent.

30:36.831 --> 30:38.212
He was probably in Thailand.

30:38.232 --> 30:40.333
For all I know, he was driving
the truck I was in.

30:40.367 --> 30:42.402
Castle, we could never
locate Jenkins,

30:42.436 --> 30:44.070
much less find his real name.

30:44.104 --> 30:45.271
But maybe now we can.

30:45.306 --> 30:47.273
If Jenkins had contact
with Powers,

30:47.308 --> 30:50.109
there may be evidence in here
that can lead us to him.

30:50.144 --> 30:53.112
Yo. We got a hit off that A.P.B.

30:53.147 --> 30:54.914
A transit cop thinks
he just saw Golovkin get off

30:54.949 --> 30:56.916
a subway stop
at Sheridan Square.

30:56.951 --> 30:58.484
That's half a block
from Jeff Powers' apartment.

30:58.518 --> 31:00.374
Yeah. Maybe he went back there.

31:00.735 --> 31:02.154
Castle, stay put, okay?

31:02.188 --> 31:03.495
- Yeah. You be careful.
- I will.

31:03.515 --> 31:06.559
ESU's got my back.

31:41.310 --> 31:43.561
The seal is cut.
Someone went inside.

31:43.896 --> 31:45.898
He might still be there.

31:54.039 --> 31:55.506
Okay, go.

31:56.950 --> 31:59.377
- Police! NYPD!
- NYPD!

32:01.252 --> 32:02.880
Man: Detectives, over here.

32:04.916 --> 32:07.518
Esposito: That's Amber,
the stripper.

32:07.552 --> 32:09.486
Golovkin must have
questioned her.

32:11.523 --> 32:13.016
Now he knows we're onto him.

32:13.036 --> 32:15.553
Bringing her here was his way
of rubbing our faces in it.

32:15.573 --> 32:18.829
Yeah, but what's his angle?
What's he after?

32:19.109 --> 32:20.597
I don't know,
but whatever it is,

32:20.632 --> 32:22.670
he's not gonna stop
until he gets it.

32:37.910 --> 32:39.979
Good evening, sir.
How may I help you?

32:39.999 --> 32:42.952
Actually,
I'm working with the NYPD.

32:42.986 --> 32:45.531
I was wondering if
I could ask you a few questions.

32:45.551 --> 32:48.057
Have you ever seen this man?

32:48.275 --> 32:49.859
Mr. Jeff... of course.

32:49.893 --> 32:52.346
He's a regular customer
here at Sunil's café.

32:52.366 --> 32:53.629
<i>Very</i> regular.

32:53.664 --> 32:54.763
In fact,
for the past six months,

32:54.797 --> 32:57.766
he's come here, without fail,
every Tuesday at 6:00 p.m.

32:57.800 --> 32:59.230
Was he meeting anyone?

32:59.250 --> 33:01.370
No. He always dines alone.

33:01.404 --> 33:02.737
What about this man?

33:02.772 --> 33:05.040
Have you ever seen him
or the two of them together?

33:06.499 --> 33:08.810
No. He's not familiar to me.

33:08.844 --> 33:10.553
- I'm sorry.
- Of course.

33:10.727 --> 33:12.741
Thank you for your time.

33:35.952 --> 33:37.238
Hey.

33:37.272 --> 33:38.606
Who are you?

33:39.215 --> 33:40.674
You should never have come.

33:40.709 --> 33:43.611
If you're here,
it means that I'm a dead man.

33:43.645 --> 33:45.731
I thought
you already were a dead man.

33:46.303 --> 33:47.959
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're not going anywhere

33:47.979 --> 33:49.683
until you tell me
what the hell's going on.

33:49.718 --> 33:51.184
[Sighs]

33:51.391 --> 33:52.686
Fine.

33:52.721 --> 33:54.989
We must leave. Now.

34:01.652 --> 34:03.619
Where are we going?

34:03.654 --> 34:05.490
[Muffled conversations]

34:05.913 --> 34:08.056
What is this place?

34:10.820 --> 34:13.143
They promised me
you wouldn't remember.

34:13.163 --> 34:15.347
How did you find me?

34:15.496 --> 34:16.764
Jeff Powers.

34:17.212 --> 34:20.094
Powers would never talk.
Unless...

34:22.135 --> 34:23.838
He's dead, isn't he?

34:25.293 --> 34:26.176
[Scoffs] When?

34:26.196 --> 34:28.572
- Yesterday.
- Was it the Russian?

34:29.270 --> 34:30.911
You know about the Russian? How?

34:30.946 --> 34:32.547
This is even worse than I thought.
[Dialing]

34:32.581 --> 34:33.447
Who are you calling?

34:33.482 --> 34:35.617
This is icarus.
I've got a code 7-9-1.

34:35.650 --> 34:36.650
[Beep]

34:36.652 --> 34:39.844
What does that mean?
Just tell me who you are.

34:39.864 --> 34:42.223
I'm Bilal.

34:42.565 --> 34:44.446
Bilal Khan.

34:44.927 --> 34:46.306
You really don't know me.

34:46.327 --> 34:47.984
I know you were
in the truck, wounded.

34:48.004 --> 34:50.732
Long before that,
I was your friend.

34:51.043 --> 34:52.100
What are you talking about?

34:52.120 --> 34:55.502
I was an exchange student
at Faircroft Prep in 11th grade.

34:55.536 --> 34:56.850
You weren't. I'd remember that.

34:56.870 --> 34:59.806
Not anymore.
[Breathing heavily]

34:59.841 --> 35:01.007
You see?

35:01.042 --> 35:03.573
The two of us, together.

35:03.593 --> 35:05.239
The good old days.

35:05.259 --> 35:06.271
That's the trophy...

35:06.291 --> 35:08.849
the one I thought I won
with Phil Bartlett.

35:08.883 --> 35:10.844
That's because they had to erase
all your memories of me

35:10.852 --> 35:12.853
and replace them
with somebody else.

35:12.887 --> 35:13.821
Who are "they"?

35:13.855 --> 35:15.689
I can't believe
they picked Phil Bartlett.

35:15.724 --> 35:16.990
W-what a douchebag.

35:17.024 --> 35:19.760
Listen, Bilal...
I-it's Bilal, right?

35:19.794 --> 35:21.528
Even if what you said is true

35:21.563 --> 35:23.530
a-and we knew each other
in 11th grade...

35:23.565 --> 35:24.631
You even consulted with me

35:24.666 --> 35:27.033
when you wrote your first,
uh, Derrick storm book.

35:27.068 --> 35:28.601
Consulted about what?

35:29.093 --> 35:30.384
Terrorism.

35:30.404 --> 35:33.206
Since I was working with, uh,
Pakistani intelligence,

35:33.241 --> 35:35.008
I was something of an expert
on the topic.

35:35.042 --> 35:37.010
Okay, but how does that explain
Jeff Powers?

35:37.044 --> 35:38.611
Why would he come
to the restaurant every Tuesday?

35:38.645 --> 35:40.013
To check in with me.

35:40.435 --> 35:43.616
He was my handler,
my C.I.A. handler.

35:43.650 --> 35:44.817
And now my cover's blown.

35:44.852 --> 35:46.907
Your cover? So you're a spy?

35:46.927 --> 35:48.406
Not a spy.

35:48.879 --> 35:51.824
Look, after I left
the intelligence service,

35:51.859 --> 35:54.423
I lost my way.

35:55.194 --> 35:57.270
I joined Al-qaeda.

35:58.164 --> 35:59.698
[Door opens]

36:01.312 --> 36:02.701
You were in Al-qaeda?

36:02.735 --> 36:05.070
[Clatter] Can you please
keep your voice down?

36:05.444 --> 36:07.272
Yes, I was.

36:07.507 --> 36:09.647
I rose up to become a part
of their senior leadership.

36:09.667 --> 36:11.977
And now you're bussing tables
and you live here?

36:12.012 --> 36:14.780
I chose this life.
It's my penance.

36:14.814 --> 36:16.180
I wanted to leave Al-qaeda,

36:16.215 --> 36:18.550
and I had inside knowledge
about that organization.

36:18.584 --> 36:20.552
So I struck a deal
with American intelligence

36:20.586 --> 36:23.054
to trade what I knew
for a second chance.

36:23.088 --> 36:24.155
You defected.

36:24.189 --> 36:25.724
[Chuckling] If you like.

36:25.758 --> 36:27.726
I hid in a Buddhist monastery
in Thailand

36:27.760 --> 36:29.560
where I was supposed to
meet my C.I.A. contact

36:29.562 --> 36:31.730
and get safe passage
to the United States.

36:31.764 --> 36:33.564
But things didn't go as planned.

36:33.598 --> 36:36.275
And what does any of this have
to do with me? Why was I there?

36:36.295 --> 36:38.803
Because I needed you.

36:39.988 --> 36:42.573
Needed me? Needed me for what?

36:42.607 --> 36:44.809
I was about to turn myself
over to the C.I.A.

36:44.843 --> 36:46.210
When my contact was killed

36:46.245 --> 36:48.379
by a bullet
that was meant for me.

36:48.414 --> 36:50.748
Now, the rendezvous point was
supposed to be a secret.

36:50.782 --> 36:52.182
Which means there was a leak.

36:52.216 --> 36:53.216
I could trust no one.

36:53.251 --> 36:56.086
I-I had some leverage,
so I agreed to meet again,

36:56.120 --> 36:59.256
but only in the company
of somebody I trusted,

36:59.290 --> 37:00.891
somebody I knew.

37:00.926 --> 37:02.926
Somebody [Chuckles]
too prominent to be eliminated.

37:02.928 --> 37:06.096
I knew only one such man... you.

37:06.130 --> 37:07.672
How did we end up in that truck?

37:07.692 --> 37:10.700
The Russian had been hunting me,
hired by Al-qaeda.

37:10.734 --> 37:13.003
He finally caught up with me.

37:13.037 --> 37:14.771
That's how you got wounded.

37:14.805 --> 37:17.274
- Was I wounded, too?
- Fortunately, no.

37:17.308 --> 37:18.842
[Car approaches]

37:20.911 --> 37:23.139
- My ride's here.
- I still have a lot of questions.

37:23.159 --> 37:25.615
There's no more time.
I-I'm sorry, Rick.

37:25.649 --> 37:28.017
Look, I was the cause
of much upheaval in your life.

37:28.051 --> 37:30.019
Please know
that was never my intention.

37:30.053 --> 37:31.721
In fact,
I have the deepest gratitude

37:31.755 --> 37:33.222
for everything that you've done.

37:33.256 --> 37:35.461
I just wish
I could remember what it was.

37:35.722 --> 37:37.428
As do I.

37:38.410 --> 37:39.695
I doubt we'll meet again.

37:39.729 --> 37:41.208
Be well.

37:51.982 --> 37:54.220
Come away from the light.

37:55.402 --> 37:56.912
Come.

38:02.524 --> 38:06.690
Look, I'm... I'm...
I'm not part of this.

38:07.050 --> 38:09.066
I know absolutely nothing.

38:09.086 --> 38:11.859
It does not matter.

38:14.997 --> 38:17.765
[Silenced gunshot]

38:17.799 --> 38:19.596
[Thud]

38:27.044 --> 38:29.143
I thought
we had an understanding

38:29.177 --> 38:31.121
that you wouldn't pursue this.

38:31.382 --> 38:32.647
Jenkins.

38:32.681 --> 38:34.849
Well, you'll have to forget
about Bilal Khan

38:34.883 --> 38:37.214
and everything else
that's occurred tonight.

38:38.806 --> 38:41.089
Are you gonna help me to forget?

38:41.109 --> 38:43.266
We'd prefer not to.

38:43.688 --> 38:47.705
Yes, well... Thank you for that.

38:48.229 --> 38:50.197
Oh, and, uh...

38:50.231 --> 38:52.199
[Grunts]

38:52.233 --> 38:54.406
That's for making me miss
my wedding day.

38:54.426 --> 38:55.802
[Grunts]

38:55.836 --> 38:57.726
[Panting]

39:00.387 --> 39:03.309
You have no idea
how lucky you are, Mr. Castle.

39:03.343 --> 39:04.377
[Inhales sharply]

39:04.411 --> 39:07.614
As for missing your wedding,
that was unavoidable,

39:07.648 --> 39:09.158
- if it's any consolation.
- It's not.

39:09.178 --> 39:11.150
You dragged me
halfway across the world.

39:11.185 --> 39:12.385
You owe me an explanation.

39:12.419 --> 39:14.320
I'm not at liberty
to give you one.

39:14.354 --> 39:16.522
Well, then I'm not at liberty
to forget about Bilal Khan.

39:16.557 --> 39:17.890
Or Golovkin here.

39:17.924 --> 39:20.326
- Mr. Castle...
- What?

39:20.360 --> 39:22.295
You gonna kill me? You can't.

39:22.329 --> 39:25.185
Raise too many questions.

39:25.205 --> 39:27.800
That's why you brought me
back from Thailand,

39:27.834 --> 39:29.587
minus my memory.

39:29.773 --> 39:32.539
I was gone two months
thanks to you.

39:32.559 --> 39:35.173
I missed my wedding.

39:35.208 --> 39:37.743
What couldn't wait one more day?

39:37.777 --> 39:39.812
There was a ticking clock.

39:40.237 --> 39:41.747
We'd picked up chatter

39:41.781 --> 39:44.516
about a major Al-qaeda strike
in the U.S.

39:44.550 --> 39:47.644
We knew it was hours away
and there was never enough time

39:47.664 --> 39:50.589
for us to put the pieces
together in order to stop it.

39:51.412 --> 39:53.592
But Bilal knew about the strike.

39:53.626 --> 39:56.209
Names, places,
operational details, yeah.

39:56.229 --> 39:58.597
We were desperate
for Bilal and his intel.

39:58.631 --> 40:01.199
And when his contact was killed,

40:01.572 --> 40:03.868
we needed you to get Bilal.

40:04.853 --> 40:07.116
And he came through.

40:07.136 --> 40:09.441
We were able to
prevent the strike,

40:09.461 --> 40:12.209
and we neutralized
everyone involved.

40:13.570 --> 40:15.368
That's all I can tell you.

40:15.388 --> 40:18.750
And I expect you
not to repeat it.

40:20.275 --> 40:22.920
Think of it this way...
yeah, you missed your wedding,

40:22.955 --> 40:27.614
but you also saved
tens of thousands of lives.

40:30.300 --> 40:32.763
You should leave now,
Mr. Castle.

40:36.977 --> 40:39.737
You saved tens
of thousands of lives?

40:39.757 --> 40:41.553
And went on a secret mission
to Thailand?

40:41.573 --> 40:45.127
Yes. Unfortunately, I cannot
divulge any further specifics.

40:45.147 --> 40:46.632
If you told us,
you'd have to kill us.

40:46.652 --> 40:49.713
You mock,
but it is for your own safety.

40:50.375 --> 40:51.882
I guess what really matters is,

40:51.916 --> 40:54.284
you found out the truth, dad,
and the good news is,

40:54.318 --> 40:56.286
it didn't turn out to be
your worse-case scenario.

40:56.320 --> 40:58.788
Yeah, bad news is,

40:58.822 --> 41:01.491
I can't brag about
my heroic exploits to anyone.

41:01.525 --> 41:02.525
- Mm.
- Oh.

41:02.526 --> 41:04.093
Though you're kind of
doing that right now.

41:04.127 --> 41:05.161
Totally.

41:05.196 --> 41:07.963
[Both chuckle]

41:07.998 --> 41:10.189
- I have to go study.
- See you.

41:10.550 --> 41:12.569
You know, darling, Alexis and I

41:12.603 --> 41:13.969
do not need to know the details.

41:14.004 --> 41:16.138
But I do hope
you can tell Katherine.

41:16.173 --> 41:17.173
Of course.

41:17.174 --> 41:18.273
[Door opens] Beckett: Hey.

41:18.308 --> 41:20.566
I got here as soon as I could.

41:20.586 --> 41:22.377
Never soon enough.

41:24.458 --> 41:27.083
I'm just glad that you're okay.

41:27.117 --> 41:29.284
Um, don't tell Alexis or mother

41:29.319 --> 41:30.686
about the Russian-assassin part.

41:30.720 --> 41:32.148
I left that out of the story.

41:32.168 --> 41:34.548
Yeah, well, um, there's no proof

41:34.568 --> 41:36.991
of what happened in that alley.

41:38.228 --> 41:41.330
By the time uniforms got there,
his body was already gone.

41:41.364 --> 41:42.864
If Jenkins can
get rid of memories,

41:42.898 --> 41:45.287
getting rid of a body
would be child's play.

41:47.538 --> 41:49.938
I am so sorry, Kate,

41:49.972 --> 41:51.641
for everything
I put you through.

41:51.661 --> 41:54.342
Babe, it's not like
you were partying in Thailand.

41:54.376 --> 41:56.784
You have the best excuse ever
for missing our wedding.

41:56.804 --> 41:58.479
You were saving the world.

41:58.513 --> 42:01.682
Yeah. Still a lot
of unanswered questions, though.

42:01.717 --> 42:05.391
Like how did I get shot?
Why was I gone for two months?

42:05.515 --> 42:08.656
Yeah. You may not
know everything.

42:08.690 --> 42:12.505
No. But I know enough.

42:12.525 --> 42:14.629
- Let's drink to that.
- Yeah.

42:14.663 --> 42:16.546
