00:40.692 --> 00:44.000
Hello there.
How are you?

00:44.044 --> 00:47.699
Yes, I'm talking to you.

00:47.743 --> 00:48.961
What's the matter?

00:49.005 --> 00:51.355
Never saw a dog talk before?

00:51.399 --> 00:53.705
Well, I'm no ordinary dog.

00:53.749 --> 00:54.793
My name is--

00:57.231 --> 00:59.624
Not again. Oh, guys.

01:20.950 --> 01:23.909
I suppose this means we can't
replicate the technology.

01:25.781 --> 01:29.045
Therefore we must
find the original.

01:34.572 --> 01:36.835
I guess I have to do
everything myself.

01:45.888 --> 01:50.153
Hi, I'm looking
for the owner of a dog
named A.R.C.H.I.E.

03:22.071 --> 03:23.768
We're at Angels 10,

03:23.812 --> 03:26.336
and our ETA will be in
exactly niner minutes.

03:26.380 --> 03:28.947
I didn't understand
a single thing you said.

03:28.991 --> 03:30.340
Gotta learn the lingo.

03:30.384 --> 03:32.255
Soon you're going
to be a pilot too.

03:32.299 --> 03:34.475
Not that soon.
I've only logged
seven hours.

03:34.518 --> 03:36.868
You did a decent job
taking off.

03:36.912 --> 03:39.871
Taking off isn't much good
if you don't know how to land.

03:39.915 --> 03:41.221
Which I don't.

03:41.264 --> 03:43.179
I still can't believe
you have a plane.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.616
Yeah. It belonged
to my father.

03:45.660 --> 03:46.835
I figured it was time
I learn how to fly it.

03:46.878 --> 03:48.358
Flying is a piece of cake.

03:48.402 --> 03:50.360
Easy peasy summer breezy.

03:50.404 --> 03:52.406
A.R.C.H.I.E.:
Whoo!

03:54.146 --> 03:55.539
Stop that.

03:55.583 --> 03:57.193
You're going
to make me airsick.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.848
You can't resist
an opportunity
to show off, can you?

03:59.891 --> 04:02.067
I gotta be me.

04:02.111 --> 04:04.679
Well, can you be you when
we're safely on the ground?

04:04.722 --> 04:06.985
I can't have anything
jeopardize this trip.

04:07.029 --> 04:09.814
Hopefully soon I'm going
to be living my dream.

04:09.858 --> 04:12.252
Right. Joining the circus.

04:12.295 --> 04:14.689
I'm still really impressed
you're going through with it,
Sydney.

04:14.732 --> 04:16.125
When I heard
my favorite carnival

04:16.168 --> 04:17.300
was passing through
this town

04:17.344 --> 04:19.302
I figured this was
my big chance.

04:19.346 --> 04:21.086
I just hope we don't die
before we get there.

04:21.130 --> 04:22.958
A.R.C.H.I.E.:
Hang on.

04:25.221 --> 04:27.484
Please don't do that.

05:31.592 --> 05:33.463
I'm really glad
you're here, Bogart.

05:34.899 --> 05:37.859
But you shouldn't stay
just for me.

05:37.902 --> 05:40.775
I wouldn't be
a very good friend
if I expected that.

05:40.818 --> 05:43.168
You should go live in the wild
like a normal bird.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.394
He still won't go?

05:51.438 --> 05:53.353
No.

05:53.396 --> 05:54.571
Don't worry.

05:54.615 --> 05:57.139
He will when he's ready.

05:57.182 --> 06:00.098
Are you sure
you're going to be
okay with this, Dad?

06:00.142 --> 06:02.274
Having an animal
as part of the carnival

06:02.318 --> 06:04.842
would be an added
attraction.

06:04.886 --> 06:06.453
And we could definitely
use the money.

06:08.237 --> 06:10.370
Well, we could.

06:10.413 --> 06:12.807
But remember your good idea?

06:12.850 --> 06:15.375
We're not a circus that
forces animals to work.

06:17.594 --> 06:19.422
Yeah, I know.

06:19.466 --> 06:21.119
Don't worry
about the money.

06:21.163 --> 06:22.860
We'll figure something out.

06:24.601 --> 06:26.473
Are you sure
you're going to be okay
letting Bogart go?

06:29.040 --> 06:30.912
I'll be sad.

06:30.955 --> 06:33.001
But I'll also be happy
because he'll be free.

06:38.833 --> 06:41.183
Can you be happy and sad
at the same time?

06:44.229 --> 06:46.014
Absolutely.

06:46.057 --> 06:48.190
That's part of life.

06:49.713 --> 06:51.759
It's better
than being just sad,
I guess.

06:53.325 --> 06:54.457
Come here.

07:02.509 --> 07:05.425
Guys, it's going
to be a great week
at the cottage.

07:05.468 --> 07:07.514
A.R.C.H.I.E.:
I only wish Sally could've
been here to see this.

07:08.776 --> 07:11.953
I'm sorry again about your
breakup with Sally, A.R.C.H.I.E.

07:11.996 --> 07:14.608
A.R.C.H.I.E.:
I've loved and I've lost, Paul.

07:14.651 --> 07:17.219
But in the end,
I guess I was too...

07:17.262 --> 07:19.482
different.

07:19.526 --> 07:21.266
But even the best of us
get dumped.

07:21.310 --> 07:23.181
You should know that
better than anyone else.

07:25.357 --> 07:27.969
I didn't get dumped.

07:28.012 --> 07:30.101
Brooke just got
a very big job offer

07:30.145 --> 07:33.191
on the other side of the world
that she couldn't turn down.

07:33.235 --> 07:35.890
And she didn't invite you
to go with her.

07:35.933 --> 07:37.979
And she's probably
never coming back.

07:38.022 --> 07:39.546
A.R.C.H.I.E.:
Sounds like dumped to me.

07:40.851 --> 07:42.766
Thanks, guys.

07:45.682 --> 07:47.118
Between breaking up with Sally

07:47.162 --> 07:48.946
and then Isabel
going away to school

07:48.990 --> 07:50.948
you must be pretty lonely
these days.

07:50.992 --> 07:53.342
Sometimes
you gotta say goodbye
to your friends.

07:53.385 --> 07:55.257
Whether you
like it or not.

08:09.576 --> 08:10.664
Ow.

08:23.328 --> 08:26.157
Company meeting, everyone!

08:26.201 --> 08:27.681
Please take your seats.

08:36.733 --> 08:38.735
Well, folks,

08:38.779 --> 08:41.782
once again our family carnival
is one the verge of bankruptcy.

08:41.825 --> 08:43.044
Yeah!

08:45.437 --> 08:46.917
What, is that bad?

08:46.961 --> 08:48.179
Yes.

08:48.223 --> 08:49.703
Oh.

08:50.747 --> 08:52.749
It seems...

08:52.793 --> 08:55.143
nobody wants to go to
the carnival anymore.

08:55.186 --> 08:58.059
All people want to do is
play games on their phones.

08:58.102 --> 08:59.582
Well, that doesn't
make any sense.

08:59.626 --> 09:02.063
I don't understand.
We've had some decent
turnouts lately.

09:02.106 --> 09:04.065
Not decent enough, Joko.

09:04.108 --> 09:06.154
You know,
you could just
call me Randy.

09:06.197 --> 09:08.069
You know how I feel about
calling you Randy.

09:08.112 --> 09:10.550
I don't call you
Randy anymore.

09:10.593 --> 09:12.029
Okay.

09:13.378 --> 09:15.293
It brings me great sadness

09:15.337 --> 09:17.905
to say that we barely have
enough money to stay afloat.

09:17.948 --> 09:21.952
Well, maybe that's
because we have
mismanaged finances, Max.

09:21.996 --> 09:23.954
I'm sorry, guys,

09:23.998 --> 09:27.741
but how much
are we spending to feed
Boogie the bird out there?

09:27.784 --> 09:29.394
That's not his name.

09:29.438 --> 09:30.657
It's Bogart.

09:32.310 --> 09:33.485
Oh, what'd I say?

09:33.529 --> 09:34.835
You said 'Boogie'
like you always do.

09:34.878 --> 09:36.053
Sorry, pal.

09:36.097 --> 09:38.708
It's Bo-gart.

09:38.752 --> 09:41.232
Bogart, I'm sorry.
It won't happen again, okay?

09:41.276 --> 09:43.408
Anyway, if Boogie
wants to be part
of this troupe

09:43.452 --> 09:45.410
he's gotta
start contributing.

09:45.454 --> 09:46.847
He doesn't perform.

09:46.890 --> 09:48.718
Like, does nothing.

09:48.762 --> 09:50.938
I'm sorry,
but the bird is bad.

09:50.981 --> 09:53.027
He literally
doesn't do anything.

09:53.070 --> 09:55.682
He won't lift a finger
to help out in any way.

09:55.725 --> 09:57.379
Birds don't have fingers.

09:57.422 --> 09:58.380
They have claws.

09:59.729 --> 10:01.688
Okay, that's enough.

10:01.731 --> 10:03.733
This has nothing to do
with Bogart.

10:03.777 --> 10:06.127
It has everything to do
with ticket sales.

10:06.170 --> 10:08.085
In fact, if--

10:08.129 --> 10:10.958
we don't have an extremely
successful week

10:11.001 --> 10:13.525
these could be our last shows
before we have to close forever.

10:13.569 --> 10:14.788
Close down the carnival?

10:14.831 --> 10:17.660
But this is our whole life.

10:17.704 --> 10:18.748
This is what we live for!

10:18.792 --> 10:20.532
What are we supposed to do?

10:20.576 --> 10:21.925
The only thing we can do.

10:23.797 --> 10:26.626
We have to try our hardest,

10:26.669 --> 10:28.192
give our all,

10:28.236 --> 10:30.847
and have the best turnout
we've ever had.

10:30.891 --> 10:35.025
And in order to do that
we need to do something special.

10:35.069 --> 10:37.811
Something that will
take people's breath away

10:37.854 --> 10:39.856
leaving them awestruck

10:39.900 --> 10:43.338
having witnessed something so
magnificent and spectacular

10:43.381 --> 10:45.906
that will make
the unwashed masses

10:45.949 --> 10:48.343
toss aside their
electronic devices

10:48.386 --> 10:52.129
and flock to
our glorious ta-da!

10:56.090 --> 10:57.787
Okay, who-- Who was that?

10:57.831 --> 11:00.572
I tooted.

11:00.616 --> 11:04.228
You should see my mason jar
collection of toots.

11:04.272 --> 11:08.493
I organize them
by size and color.

11:08.537 --> 11:10.757
Okay, that's--

11:10.800 --> 11:12.236
that's odd.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.064
It's natural, we all do it.

11:15.109 --> 11:16.676
You do it.

11:19.287 --> 11:21.245
- I've heard her.
- I don't.

11:21.289 --> 11:23.726
They smell like apple pie.

11:23.770 --> 11:26.598
That makes
very little sense.

11:26.642 --> 11:27.817
Max, I don't.

11:29.645 --> 11:31.821
Everyone...

11:31.865 --> 11:33.954
try your hardest.

11:33.997 --> 11:35.999
That does not smell good.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.157
Hey.

12:49.072 --> 12:50.639
What are you doing?

12:50.682 --> 12:53.250
Um, nothing.

12:53.294 --> 12:54.861
Dinner's ready.

13:02.912 --> 13:04.479
Mmm. Smells like victory
in here.

13:04.522 --> 13:05.349
What's for dinner?

13:05.393 --> 13:07.351
Pancakes.

13:07.395 --> 13:10.833
Sydney, can you make something
more dinnery?

13:10.877 --> 13:12.661
I'm a sucker for tacos,
doesn't even have
to be Tuesday.

13:12.704 --> 13:14.054
It is Tuesday.

13:14.097 --> 13:15.664
Even better!
Can we have tacos?

13:15.707 --> 13:17.231
No.

13:17.274 --> 13:18.449
How about lasagna?
I love lasagna.

13:18.493 --> 13:19.624
No.

13:19.668 --> 13:20.800
- Sloppy joes?
- No.

13:20.843 --> 13:23.193
- Baba ghanoush?
- No.

13:23.237 --> 13:26.153
Look, tomorrow is my audition
for the carnival.

13:26.196 --> 13:29.417
The night before a big day I
always have breakfast for dinner

13:29.460 --> 13:30.940
it's my favorite.

13:30.984 --> 13:33.203
What do you have
for breakfast,
shepherd's pie?

13:33.247 --> 13:35.031
Sometimes.

13:35.075 --> 13:37.120
Sydney, are you sure
you want to do this?

13:37.164 --> 13:40.080
I mean, you quit your job and
you packed up your whole life.

13:40.123 --> 13:42.125
I've never been
more sure of anything.

13:42.169 --> 13:43.953
It's my life-long dream.

13:43.997 --> 13:46.042
A.R.C.H.I.E.:
Why the circus?

13:46.086 --> 13:50.177
Ever since I was young
I've always felt out of place.

13:50.220 --> 13:52.353
Like I didn't belong.

13:52.396 --> 13:54.964
Never once have I felt
part of the cool group.

13:56.923 --> 13:58.446
Amongst a bunch of outcasts
in a circus

13:58.489 --> 14:01.449
I think I'll finally
be accepted.

14:01.492 --> 14:04.278
I'll feel normal.

14:04.321 --> 14:07.542
Speaking of normal,
you know the rules.

14:07.585 --> 14:09.674
I know, I know.

14:09.718 --> 14:11.502
I can't tell anyone about
A.R.C.H.I.E.'s special talents.

14:11.546 --> 14:14.027
Remember how freaked out
you were when we told you?

14:18.335 --> 14:20.903
A.R.C.H.I.E.:
I'm a cybernetic organism.

14:20.947 --> 14:23.471
I'm a cybernetic organism.

14:23.514 --> 14:26.039
I'm a cybernetic organism.

14:26.082 --> 14:28.389
I'm a cybernetic organism.

14:31.435 --> 14:35.135
Yeah, it took me a minute or two
to get used to the idea.

14:35.178 --> 14:38.094
Look, I wouldn't think of
telling anyone.

14:38.138 --> 14:40.096
I don't know why you wouldn't
want people to know.

14:40.140 --> 14:41.576
If I had his talents

14:41.619 --> 14:44.100
I'd be bragging about it
left, right and center.

14:44.144 --> 14:46.450
What I wouldn't give
to be normal.

14:46.494 --> 14:49.366
Oh, trust me, it's overrated.

14:49.410 --> 14:51.064
So, what are you going to do
for your audition?

14:52.848 --> 14:55.503
I don't exactly know.

14:55.546 --> 14:57.809
If it's human contortionist,
you're a shoe-in.

15:00.421 --> 15:03.119
I take it back,
not all your talents are great.

15:05.034 --> 15:07.167
I'm going to get you!

15:07.210 --> 15:08.777
Hey!

15:10.779 --> 15:12.563
I've been
looking everywhere
for you two clowns.

15:12.607 --> 15:13.651
Oh, we're not clowns!

15:13.695 --> 15:14.870
I know.

15:14.914 --> 15:15.958
Seriously,
we're not clowns.

15:16.002 --> 15:17.307
I understand.

15:17.351 --> 15:18.830
I need you
to finish setting up.

15:18.874 --> 15:20.484
We're on our break though.

15:20.528 --> 15:22.095
Yeah! As per our
carny union rules

15:22.138 --> 15:24.967
we get a 20 minute break
every 10 minutes.

15:25.011 --> 15:26.882
I wish you never
joined that union.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.797
Also you're supposed to
provide us with a hot snack.

15:28.840 --> 15:30.451
And I do not eat gluten.

15:30.494 --> 15:32.496
I eat nothing
but gluten!

15:32.540 --> 15:34.803
I can see that,
the whole world
can see that.

15:37.937 --> 15:41.027
Verne, you're not supposed to be
playing with the equipment.

15:41.070 --> 15:42.376
We're not
playing with it, boss.

15:42.419 --> 15:43.507
I'm testing to
make sure it works.

15:53.039 --> 15:54.344
Yup, it works!

16:10.926 --> 16:12.101
What's wrong with you?

16:41.478 --> 16:43.785
You know, I don't think
you need to be so nervous.

16:43.828 --> 16:45.569
Yeah, this is not
exactly Julliard.

16:45.613 --> 16:46.657
Yes, it is.

16:46.701 --> 16:48.094
It's my Julliard.

16:50.879 --> 16:52.141
Are you Sydney?

16:54.013 --> 16:55.318
My name's Gregory.

16:55.362 --> 16:57.016
Come on in.

17:00.062 --> 17:02.282
It's magic time.

17:29.222 --> 17:30.049
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

17:54.160 --> 17:55.770
Oh! Look out below!

18:16.225 --> 18:18.140
I can't watch this.

18:18.184 --> 18:20.099
A.R.C.H.I.
We should go, we're probably
making him more nervous.

18:46.821 --> 18:49.128
Somebody put me out!
Somebody put me out!

18:56.091 --> 18:58.528
I can fix this.

18:58.572 --> 18:59.442
It--

19:05.274 --> 19:07.320
Just don't
worry about it.

19:12.412 --> 19:14.240
Well, Sydney, you--

19:14.283 --> 19:16.851
You really
threw yourself into this.

19:16.894 --> 19:18.287
Literally.

19:18.331 --> 19:22.726
It's my life-long dream
to be a part of your carnival.

19:22.770 --> 19:25.294
I really just wanted to give it
everything I had.

19:27.992 --> 19:30.647
Sydney, uh--

19:30.691 --> 19:34.390
The unfortunate thing
is to join our troupe...

19:35.435 --> 19:39.482
you must bring something
very special.

19:39.526 --> 19:43.269
Something truly unique.

19:45.314 --> 19:46.663
And...

19:48.535 --> 19:50.319
I'm sorry.

19:52.234 --> 19:53.540
Oh.

19:55.977 --> 19:59.328
I understand.

19:59.372 --> 20:03.550
Being special and unique -
never really been
my strong suits.

20:04.681 --> 20:06.596
Story of my life.

20:10.861 --> 20:14.822
Well, thank you
for your time, gentlemen.

20:17.781 --> 20:19.261
We're very sorry.

20:19.305 --> 20:20.349
Thank you.

20:21.916 --> 20:24.048
Thank you. Excuse me.

20:37.671 --> 20:39.325
I guess I need
a new one of these.

20:43.807 --> 20:45.418
Sydney, wait!

20:47.333 --> 20:50.640
You said that joining
the carnival is your
life-long dream?

20:50.684 --> 20:52.860
It was.

20:52.903 --> 20:55.036
But I may as well
give up on that dream

20:55.079 --> 20:56.864
now that I failed at it.

20:56.907 --> 20:58.300
You can't give up
that easily.

20:58.344 --> 21:00.346
But you heard your dad.

21:00.389 --> 21:03.305
What could I possibly do that
would be unique and special?

21:03.349 --> 21:05.438
Okay, that's it.

21:05.481 --> 21:08.223
That's it. I am
at the end of my rope
with your dumb bird.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.224
You got a rope?

21:09.268 --> 21:10.269
Why can't I have a rope?

21:10.312 --> 21:11.748
Do you even know
what this is?

21:11.792 --> 21:12.749
Huh?

21:12.793 --> 21:13.750
Do you know what that is?

21:13.794 --> 21:14.751
It's bird poop.

21:14.795 --> 21:16.100
It's bird poop!

21:16.144 --> 21:18.277
Not only does that lazy bird
not do anything

21:18.320 --> 21:19.756
but he craps all over me!

21:19.800 --> 21:22.237
I'm telling you this carnival
is in need of some animals

21:22.281 --> 21:24.283
with some real talent!

21:24.326 --> 21:25.371
Some real talent!

21:25.414 --> 21:27.198
It's all I'm asking, buddy.

21:27.242 --> 21:28.374
Just a little talent!

21:29.418 --> 21:30.376
Talent!

21:33.857 --> 21:37.470
Animals with real talent.

21:37.513 --> 21:38.471
Do you think you could
convince you dad

21:38.514 --> 21:40.473
to give me another audition?

21:40.516 --> 21:41.909
Consider it done.

21:41.952 --> 21:43.214
Yes!

21:43.258 --> 21:44.738
Oh!

21:44.781 --> 21:48.394
Yes!

21:57.054 --> 22:00.580
Man, it sure is beautiful.

22:00.623 --> 22:02.843
Would be nice to have
Isabel here too.

22:02.886 --> 22:04.714
Yeah.

22:04.758 --> 22:05.889
Hey.

22:05.933 --> 22:08.283
You okay?

22:08.327 --> 22:10.416
Do you ever wish
you were normal?

22:12.461 --> 22:14.202
I think I'm pretty normal.

22:14.245 --> 22:16.117
Kinda.

22:16.160 --> 22:20.426
No, I mean normal like with
a normal family and stuff.

22:21.514 --> 22:24.125
Oh, you mean like wife, kids,

22:24.168 --> 22:27.215
white picket fence and a dog?

22:27.258 --> 22:28.738
A regular dog?

22:30.827 --> 22:32.742
Yeah, I guess.

22:32.786 --> 22:34.483
But we've got
a pretty great family.

22:34.527 --> 22:37.399
It's unconventional
but it works for me.

22:37.443 --> 22:39.836
Lately I've been wishing
I could be an ordinary dog.

22:39.880 --> 22:42.317
Do ordinary dog things.

22:42.361 --> 22:45.451
Like catch a frisbee
or pee on a fire hydrant.

22:45.494 --> 22:47.104
Sniff another dog's butt.

22:48.454 --> 22:50.194
Really?

22:50.238 --> 22:52.327
Well, maybe not the sniffing
the other dog's butt part.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.938
I'm sure you could do all those
things if you really wanted to.

22:54.982 --> 22:58.420
Yeah, but sometimes I wish it
was all I wanted to do.

22:58.464 --> 22:59.900
I don't know, A.R.C.H.I.E.

22:59.943 --> 23:01.205
You got something special.

23:01.249 --> 23:03.077
That's the thing,

23:03.120 --> 23:05.471
sometimes being special isn't
all it's cracked up to be.

23:07.647 --> 23:09.388
Yeah, I understand
how you feel.

23:11.128 --> 23:12.521
But sometimes

23:12.565 --> 23:14.262
you just gotta accept things
for the way they are.

23:22.618 --> 23:25.447
Uh, Miss?

23:25.491 --> 23:26.405
Excuse me.

23:26.448 --> 23:28.711
Are you all right?

23:28.755 --> 23:30.365
Oh, gosh.

23:30.409 --> 23:31.975
I'm so embarrassed.

23:32.019 --> 23:34.282
I thought I was alone.

23:34.325 --> 23:35.457
Is everything okay?

23:35.501 --> 23:36.763
Yes.

23:38.504 --> 23:39.940
No.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.684
You're, uh,

23:44.727 --> 23:46.773
you're a member of that carnival
that's in town, right?

23:46.816 --> 23:48.557
Yes.

23:48.601 --> 23:51.821
I'm Laura.

23:51.865 --> 23:55.477
The man who runs the carnival,
Maximillian Zon,

23:55.521 --> 23:57.697
he's a monster.

23:57.740 --> 23:59.307
He's forcing me to work
at his piddly little carnival

23:59.350 --> 24:02.223
against my will.

24:02.266 --> 24:04.486
How can he do that?

24:04.530 --> 24:08.490
Max used to run a much larger
circus with my father.

24:08.534 --> 24:10.492
But at the height of its success
he stole all the money

24:10.536 --> 24:12.625
and then turned around
and blamed my dad.

24:12.668 --> 24:15.976
The police believed Max
and threw my dad in jail.

24:16.019 --> 24:18.021
That's awful.

24:18.065 --> 24:20.502
The worst part
is Max told me

24:20.546 --> 24:24.027
that I must work for him
in order to pay off the debt.

24:24.071 --> 24:28.249
Well...
can't you just run away?

24:28.292 --> 24:30.512
It's not that simple.

24:30.556 --> 24:32.471
We're in the middle of nowhere.

24:32.514 --> 24:34.516
Where could I go?

24:34.560 --> 24:38.172
Well, we have a plane,
I'm sure we could fly
you somewhere.

24:38.215 --> 24:41.088
You're a pilot?

24:41.131 --> 24:45.179
Well,
I'm more of a co-pilot.

24:45.222 --> 24:46.789
It's kinda complicated.

24:50.576 --> 24:51.881
I have to get to rehearsal.

24:51.925 --> 24:54.449
Max will go on a tirade
if I'm late.

24:54.493 --> 24:57.017
Thank you for listening.

24:57.060 --> 25:00.194
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have
dumped all this on you.

25:00.890 --> 25:02.849
I just don't have
anybody to talk to.

25:19.126 --> 25:21.520
Dinner is served.

25:21.563 --> 25:25.088
I have made tacos, lasagna,

25:25.132 --> 25:28.091
a side of sloppy joes,

25:28.135 --> 25:31.530
and some delicious
baba ghanoush for dessert.

25:31.573 --> 25:35.142
You made all this for me?

25:35.185 --> 25:37.144
You betcha.

25:37.187 --> 25:39.755
What do you want, Sydney?

25:39.799 --> 25:41.583
Whatever do you mean?

25:41.627 --> 25:43.890
You know what I mean,
Mr. Flapjacks-for-dinner.

25:46.632 --> 25:48.677
Are you--

25:48.721 --> 25:53.029
suggesting I want
something from you?

25:54.422 --> 25:58.208
Just because I slaved
over a hot stove

25:58.252 --> 26:01.734
making my favorite four-legged
friend his favorite dinners?

26:01.777 --> 26:03.083
That's downright insulting.

26:03.126 --> 26:06.042
Okay... my apologies.

26:06.086 --> 26:08.262
Thank you.

26:08.305 --> 26:09.829
You're welcome.

26:09.872 --> 26:11.961
How was the feedback
on the audition?

26:12.005 --> 26:15.748
Ooh, it was good.

26:15.791 --> 26:17.619
Really good.

26:17.663 --> 26:20.056
Very positive feedback.

26:20.100 --> 26:22.015
Oh, it was terrible.

26:22.058 --> 26:23.407
Abysmal.

26:23.451 --> 26:24.583
I need your help.

26:24.626 --> 26:26.062
Here we go.

26:26.106 --> 26:28.499
I totally botched
the audition.

26:28.543 --> 26:32.155
But they said that
I could come back
and re-audition tomorrow.

26:32.199 --> 26:36.072
I just gotta come up
with something special.

26:36.116 --> 26:37.378
And where do I come in?

26:37.421 --> 26:40.076
You could be that
something special.

26:40.120 --> 26:41.469
Me?

26:41.512 --> 26:42.818
Just think of it!

26:42.862 --> 26:44.124
You know, I could be
the ventriloquist

26:44.167 --> 26:46.648
and could be my dummy.

26:46.692 --> 26:48.215
I'm sorry, dummy?

26:48.258 --> 26:50.043
I'm nobody's dummy.

26:50.086 --> 26:51.697
Yeah, you know, dummy,
poor choice of words.

26:51.740 --> 26:53.699
Absolutely right.

26:53.742 --> 26:57.920
I just meant
that you could be
my little puppet.

26:57.964 --> 26:59.922
Well, that sounded
even worse.

26:59.966 --> 27:01.837
Sydney, you know the rule.

27:01.881 --> 27:04.057
Nobody can find out about me
and my special talents.

27:04.100 --> 27:07.756
And they wouldn't.
Nobody would know.
That's the genius of it.

27:07.800 --> 27:10.585
They would just think that
I was the greatest ventrilo--

27:10.629 --> 27:15.329
Okay, that we
were the greatest
ventriloquist act ever.

27:15.372 --> 27:17.679
It's too risky.

27:17.723 --> 27:20.682
Look, this would make
me a shoe-in for the
carnival.

27:20.726 --> 27:23.685
Have I mentioned that
it's my life-long dream?

27:23.729 --> 27:25.382
You wouldn't want to
stand in the way

27:25.426 --> 27:27.950
of a guy fulfilling his
life-long dream, would you?

27:27.994 --> 27:29.778
You know I'd do anything
to help you, Sydney.

27:29.822 --> 27:32.259
But I just don't think
it's a good idea.

27:32.302 --> 27:33.826
I disagree.

27:35.392 --> 27:37.568
I think it's a great idea.

27:37.612 --> 27:39.048
Oh, no.

27:42.095 --> 27:44.097
I'm so sorry.

27:44.140 --> 27:46.186
I hope you don't think that
I was spying on you.

27:46.229 --> 27:50.451
I just came by to thank Paul
for being so kind to me.

27:50.494 --> 27:52.671
A talking dog.

27:52.714 --> 27:54.585
Incredible.

27:54.629 --> 27:57.719
How is this possible?

27:57.763 --> 27:59.808
Oh, don't worry,
you can trust me.

28:02.768 --> 28:04.987
I think we can trust Miss Lake.

28:05.031 --> 28:06.989
She is a star
on the carnival circuit.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.646
I'm a cybernetic organism.

28:14.127 --> 28:15.606
A robot?

28:15.650 --> 28:17.565
Yeah, something like that.

28:17.608 --> 28:20.220
Oh, how wonderful.

28:20.263 --> 28:23.963
For what it's worth, I think
Sydney is totally right.

28:24.006 --> 28:26.922
Having you at the carnival
would be a huge attraction.

28:26.966 --> 28:29.620
For starters it could mean
a ton in ticket sales.

28:29.664 --> 28:32.101
But wouldn't that kind of be
like a lie?

28:32.145 --> 28:33.799
A very entertaining lie.

28:33.842 --> 28:36.062
As all good art is.

28:36.105 --> 28:38.238
And, don't worry, I would make
sure that your secret was safe

28:38.281 --> 28:41.023
from the rest of
the carnival troupe.

28:41.067 --> 28:45.854
Well, I suppose if
we were really...

28:45.898 --> 28:48.770
absolutely, positively,
definitely careful

28:48.814 --> 28:51.077
I guess it could work.

28:51.120 --> 28:52.948
Yes!

28:52.992 --> 28:55.211
Oh, happy day! Happy day!

28:55.255 --> 28:57.474
Hey look at me wagging my
tail for you, A.R.C.H.I.E.

29:10.096 --> 29:12.185
Hello, everyone,
my name is Sydney.

29:12.228 --> 29:15.275
And this is A.R.C.H.I.E.

29:15.318 --> 29:17.190
Say hello, A.R.C.H.I.E.

29:20.976 --> 29:23.065
Come on, A.R.C.H.I.E.,
don't be rude. Say hello.

29:24.980 --> 29:26.373
Come on, you silly mutt,
speak.

29:29.376 --> 29:31.160
Silly mutt?

29:31.204 --> 29:33.206
You the one wearing
the ridiculous tie.

29:33.249 --> 29:35.948
But, A.R.C.H.I.E.,
you're wearing a tie too.

29:35.991 --> 29:37.645
Yeah, but it's not
so ridiculous on me.

29:37.688 --> 29:38.951
And it brings out my eyes.

29:40.387 --> 29:41.910
That's funny.

29:41.954 --> 29:44.521
A.R.C.H.I.E.,
you sure are a comedian.

29:44.565 --> 29:48.525
In fact,
let's do a few jokes.
Shall we?

29:48.569 --> 29:49.570
Knock, knock.

29:49.613 --> 29:50.658
Who's there?

29:50.701 --> 29:52.138
Little old lady.

29:52.181 --> 29:53.966
Little old lady who.

29:54.009 --> 29:56.055
I didn't know
you could yodel.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.842
Here's another one for you.

30:00.886 --> 30:02.757
Why did the turkey
cross the road?

30:02.801 --> 30:03.845
I don't know.

30:03.889 --> 30:05.281
Yes, you do.

30:05.325 --> 30:06.326
To prove
he wasn't chicken.

30:10.460 --> 30:13.289
Man, this is a
really bad idea.
I shouldn't be here.

30:13.333 --> 30:16.031
No, no, no, A.R.C.H.I.E.

30:31.525 --> 30:33.744
Bravo.

30:33.788 --> 30:35.268
Bra-vo.

30:35.311 --> 30:36.922
Bravo!

30:36.965 --> 30:38.619
Ha ha!

30:38.662 --> 30:42.014
That was incredible.

30:42.057 --> 30:43.319
T-thank you.

30:43.363 --> 30:44.973
How did you do that?

30:45.017 --> 30:49.064
Uh, well I had years of
ventriloquism training.

30:49.108 --> 30:52.633
I went to the Royal Academy
of Ventriloquism Arts

30:52.676 --> 30:55.157
in Britain, England.

30:55.201 --> 30:57.159
RAVABE.

30:57.203 --> 31:00.946
Well, sir,
you are spectacular.

31:00.989 --> 31:02.904
And I'm proud
to announce that

31:02.948 --> 31:06.647
you are officially the newest
member of our carnival troupe!

31:06.690 --> 31:09.737
Welcome aboard!

31:10.956 --> 31:13.349
Okay. All right,
you're sweaty.

31:13.393 --> 31:15.525
Oh, you're sweaty.

31:15.569 --> 31:16.744
Whoo.

31:26.362 --> 31:28.669
Dad, the numbers
just don't add up.

31:28.712 --> 31:30.279
I know.

31:30.323 --> 31:32.107
We really do need to
make some money.

31:32.151 --> 31:34.805
No, I mean you have been
making some money.

31:34.849 --> 31:36.285
The ticket sales
haven't been great,

31:36.329 --> 31:38.548
but they've been better
than you realize.

31:38.592 --> 31:40.246
What are you saying,

31:40.289 --> 31:41.551
that we should have
more money than we do?

31:41.595 --> 31:44.946
According
to the records, yes.

31:44.990 --> 31:47.166
How can that be?

31:47.209 --> 31:48.994
Someone must be
stealing from you.

31:49.995 --> 31:51.648
That's impossible.

31:51.692 --> 31:53.955
Is it?

31:53.999 --> 31:56.610
It-it doesn't matter.

31:56.653 --> 31:59.265
Sydney and his talking dog
will save everything.

31:59.308 --> 32:01.745
Hopefully we'll make enough
money and right the ship.

32:01.789 --> 32:04.139
And if we do,
we should put it in
the bank right away.

32:04.183 --> 32:06.228
It's not safe
having all this cash around.

32:06.272 --> 32:08.230
No.

32:08.274 --> 32:10.145
No banks.

32:10.189 --> 32:11.973
That's what
got us into trouble
in the first place.

32:12.017 --> 32:13.453
Right now the best thing
we can do

32:13.496 --> 32:16.282
is operate as
a cash-only business.

32:16.325 --> 32:19.850
I'll trust you
to keep it safe right?

32:22.027 --> 32:24.507
Why is this carnival
so important to you?

32:24.551 --> 32:26.857
It's my legacy.

32:26.901 --> 32:29.164
Again, it's about you.

32:29.208 --> 32:31.384
That shouldn't surprise me.

32:31.427 --> 32:35.475
No, son, my legacy isn't
about me, it's about you.

32:35.518 --> 32:38.826
Have you ever considered
that I might not want this?

32:38.869 --> 32:40.959
All I want is a normal life.

32:41.002 --> 32:43.265
Like other kids.

32:52.666 --> 32:55.582
Dealing with your breakup,
chapter three.

32:55.625 --> 32:58.019
Loving yourself.

32:58.063 --> 33:00.456
To be worthy of love from
your potential partner

33:00.500 --> 33:03.068
you must first be worthy of
love from yourself.

33:03.111 --> 33:05.331
I want you to wake up
every morning and say,

33:05.374 --> 33:09.770
"I am lovable. I am loveable."

33:09.813 --> 33:12.468
"I am loveable."

33:12.512 --> 33:14.166
Say what now?

33:32.880 --> 33:35.056
Hi.

33:35.100 --> 33:37.102
Hi.

33:37.145 --> 33:40.279
Are you part of the carnival?

33:40.322 --> 33:42.716
Yeah, it's my dad's.

33:42.759 --> 33:44.196
Cool. I'm Emma.

33:44.239 --> 33:46.067
I live here in town.

33:46.111 --> 33:48.461
I can't wait to see the show.

33:48.504 --> 33:52.552
Nothing very exciting
usually happens around here.

33:52.595 --> 33:55.207
Is that your pet bird?

33:57.165 --> 33:59.689
He's not a pet really.

33:59.733 --> 34:01.909
His name's Bogart.

34:01.952 --> 34:03.650
He's my friend.

34:05.304 --> 34:07.175
My only friend.

34:08.524 --> 34:10.048
Why do you say that?

34:12.485 --> 34:14.182
It gets pretty lonely
around here.

34:14.226 --> 34:17.098
Travelling with my dad
for the summer.

34:17.142 --> 34:18.926
I know how you feel.

34:18.969 --> 34:22.147
I get pretty lonely too.

34:22.190 --> 34:24.497
What's that?

34:24.540 --> 34:28.066
Oh, it's a crossword puzzle.

34:28.109 --> 34:30.459
It's a hobby of mine.

34:30.503 --> 34:33.462
Do you need any help?

34:33.506 --> 34:37.031
Oh, uh, no thanks.

34:37.075 --> 34:38.641
No problem.

34:38.685 --> 34:40.687
See you around.

34:40.730 --> 34:42.341
Bye, Bogart.

34:57.878 --> 35:00.010
I going out for a bit, Paul,
see you when I get back.

35:02.274 --> 35:04.102
Wow, you scared the crap
out of me.

35:04.145 --> 35:05.625
What are you, a ninja?

35:05.668 --> 35:07.540
I have my ways.

35:07.583 --> 35:09.629
So, where are you off to?

35:09.672 --> 35:13.763
Uh, the circus,
I'm going to the circus.

35:13.807 --> 35:15.417
And where is Sydney?

35:15.461 --> 35:17.158
Well, he's-he's-he's
there already.

35:17.202 --> 35:18.812
He's waiting for me actually.

35:18.855 --> 35:20.770
I'm late, I should go.

35:20.814 --> 35:24.122
I suppose you two are getting
ready for your big performance.

35:24.165 --> 35:27.125
Performance?
What performance?

35:30.258 --> 35:33.435
Sensational Sydney
and his talking dog.

35:33.479 --> 35:35.742
Have you two completely
lost your minds?

35:35.785 --> 35:38.527
Why would you do
something like this?

35:38.571 --> 35:40.094
I did it to help Sydney.

35:40.138 --> 35:41.791
I know it sounds crazy

35:41.835 --> 35:44.359
but we have a plan and
we think it's going to work.

35:44.403 --> 35:46.144
You think it's going to work?!

35:47.188 --> 35:49.408
Enjoy the show.

35:49.451 --> 35:51.584
How's the crossword
coming along?

35:53.194 --> 35:54.630
Kinda stumped actually.

35:57.285 --> 35:58.243
What's the clue?

35:58.286 --> 36:00.201
Maybe I can help.

36:00.245 --> 36:03.596
An 11 letter word for a
roguish, dishonest person.

36:03.639 --> 36:05.424
Hm.

36:05.467 --> 36:06.860
That is a tough one.

36:06.903 --> 36:09.210
Hey, Greg. Ooh, sorry.

36:09.254 --> 36:10.994
Didn't mean to interrupt.

36:12.561 --> 36:14.215
- It's Gregory.
- It's what?

36:14.259 --> 36:16.217
My name.
It's Gregory.

36:16.261 --> 36:17.653
It's Gregory. No, no, yeah,
I know what your name is.

36:17.697 --> 36:19.307
It's Gregory, come on. Sure.

36:19.351 --> 36:21.701
How are the ticket sales coming?

36:21.744 --> 36:22.963
Pretty good.

36:23.006 --> 36:24.704
Why are you interested?

36:24.747 --> 36:26.401
I'm just curious about
our ticket sales.

36:26.445 --> 36:29.404
I want us to succeed,
be a big successful company.

36:29.448 --> 36:30.536
- Oh, yeah.
- Carnival.

36:30.579 --> 36:31.798
Pretty good is good, right?

36:31.841 --> 36:33.234
Yeah.

36:33.278 --> 36:34.540
All right. That's good news.

36:34.583 --> 36:36.542
Okay. Well,
I better get in there.

36:36.585 --> 36:38.500
Big night of performing.

36:38.544 --> 36:40.023
So, I'll let you two lovebirds

36:40.067 --> 36:42.809
continue on
whatever you're doing.

36:42.852 --> 36:44.202
See you later.

36:56.823 --> 37:00.130
Boys and girls,
ladies and gentlemen,

37:00.174 --> 37:02.959
dukes and duchesses,

37:03.003 --> 37:05.397
monsieurs and mademoiselles,

37:05.440 --> 37:08.400
I, Maximillian Zon,

37:08.443 --> 37:12.360
nobly welcome you to
the most wondrous show

37:12.404 --> 37:14.319
with the most
magnificent performers

37:14.362 --> 37:16.277
in the history of humankind!

37:16.321 --> 37:17.496
History of humankind.

37:17.539 --> 37:19.759
- Pfft, that's a stretch.
- Shh.

37:19.802 --> 37:24.633
Tonight, you will see feats
so spectacular--

37:24.677 --> 37:27.332
They're going
to see our feets?

37:27.375 --> 37:30.291
I should've bit
my toenails off.

37:30.335 --> 37:33.642
Why-why would you do that?

37:33.686 --> 37:35.035
Why wouldn't I?

37:35.078 --> 37:37.951
So, hang on to your hats,

37:37.994 --> 37:39.996
hold your breath

37:40.040 --> 37:43.696
and prepare yourself
for the ride of a lifetime.

37:43.739 --> 37:47.656
Without further ado,
I bring you the one,

37:47.700 --> 37:50.442
- the only--

37:50.485 --> 37:51.312
- the magical--

37:51.356 --> 37:55.273
marvelous carnival!

37:58.928 --> 38:00.321
Okay, you ready for this?

38:00.365 --> 38:01.366
- Yeah, I'm ready.
- Let's go get 'em.

38:01.409 --> 38:02.062
- Let's go.
- Let's go get 'em.

38:02.105 --> 38:03.498
Let's go.

38:03.542 --> 38:05.239
Ow.

38:06.501 --> 38:09.504
Welcome to my nightmare,
your table is ready.

38:11.724 --> 38:15.641
It's magic time.

38:15.684 --> 38:18.078
Oh, boy.

39:29.105 --> 39:32.065
These people
wouldn't know art

39:32.108 --> 39:33.371
if it barfed
in their shoe.

39:42.118 --> 39:44.686
And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

39:44.730 --> 39:48.429
the performance
you've all been waiting for.

39:48.473 --> 39:51.998
Please give a warm welcome
to Sensational Sydney

39:52.041 --> 39:56.045
and his talking dog!

40:03.531 --> 40:04.532
Say hello,
A.R.C.H.I.E.

40:16.675 --> 40:20.330
I said, say hello,
A.R.C.H.I.E.

40:22.811 --> 40:24.552
Hello, A.R.C.H.I.E.

40:26.162 --> 40:29.035
Now, why don't you show
this lovely audience

40:29.078 --> 40:32.038
just how smart you are
and tell everyone

40:32.081 --> 40:34.606
what your favorite
letter of the alphabet is.

40:34.649 --> 40:35.607
- Y.
- Why?

40:35.650 --> 40:36.738
Because I told you.

40:36.782 --> 40:38.218
No, Y.

40:38.261 --> 40:39.785
Just do it for me.

40:39.828 --> 40:41.439
- You?
- U is your favorite letter?

40:41.482 --> 40:42.527
A.R.C.H.I.
No, Y.

40:42.570 --> 40:45.486
Okay.

40:45.530 --> 40:48.620
If you don't want to tell me
then we'll try something else.

40:48.663 --> 40:53.625
Uh, why don't you try and guess
what my favorite letter is?

40:53.668 --> 40:56.018
You want me to try to guess
your favorite letter?

40:56.062 --> 40:57.672
- Yes.
- I see.

40:57.716 --> 40:59.413
- That's two letters.
- What?

40:59.457 --> 41:01.981
"I" "C" are two letters.
Just pick one.

41:02.024 --> 41:03.286
Okay.

41:03.330 --> 41:04.505
That's another two letters.

41:04.549 --> 41:05.593
What?

41:05.637 --> 41:07.029
No, I meant okay, you see.

41:07.073 --> 41:08.770
Now, that's four letters.

41:08.814 --> 41:10.816
I don't think you understand
this game.

41:10.859 --> 41:12.513
I meant "okay."

41:12.557 --> 41:14.515
I heard you the first time.

41:14.559 --> 41:16.343
I don't know why
you're getting so upset.

41:16.386 --> 41:17.344
Gee!

41:17.387 --> 41:18.345
It's not G.

41:18.388 --> 41:19.346
A?

41:19.389 --> 41:20.521
It said, "It's not G."

41:20.565 --> 41:22.131
- A!
- I said it's not G!

41:22.175 --> 41:23.219
Are you deaf?

41:23.263 --> 41:24.917
No, I'm not deaf.
Are you?

41:24.960 --> 41:26.745
How many times
do I have to tell you

41:26.788 --> 41:29.269
you could only choose
one letter at a time?

41:29.312 --> 41:30.749
A.R.C.H.I.
I am, are you?

41:30.792 --> 41:32.751
Forget it.

41:32.794 --> 41:35.667
Okay, let's
go back to you.

41:35.710 --> 41:37.364
What's your
favorite letter?

41:37.407 --> 41:38.496
Y.

41:54.729 --> 41:56.688
I gotta admit,
they're really good.

42:03.346 --> 42:04.434
How you doing?

42:04.478 --> 42:07.046
Great show, isn't it?

42:07.089 --> 42:08.656
Popcorn?

42:08.700 --> 42:09.918
No thanks.

42:09.962 --> 42:11.050
Hm.

42:13.095 --> 42:15.881
Well, it does take years
and years of practice

42:15.924 --> 42:18.492
to acquire the elite set of
ventriloquism skills

42:18.536 --> 42:19.798
that I possess.

42:19.841 --> 42:21.713
But I don't want to
talk about me,

42:21.756 --> 42:23.236
that's a pretty
boring subject.

42:23.279 --> 42:27.327
I just want to thank you guys
so much for coming...

42:29.808 --> 42:31.157
Can you believe this,
Squirt?

42:31.200 --> 42:33.681
We have been working
this carnival for years

42:33.725 --> 42:37.729
and this clown shows up
and steals all our glory.

42:39.252 --> 42:41.471
And tonight after the show
he'll be signing paw-tographs,

42:41.515 --> 42:43.169
so don't--

42:43.212 --> 42:47.173
He's not a clown,
you're the clown!

42:47.216 --> 42:49.218
Yes, no,
I know I'm a clown.

42:49.262 --> 42:50.698
I'm just talking about
other clowns.

42:50.742 --> 42:52.613
Bad clowns, okay?

42:52.657 --> 42:54.397
Oh.

42:54.441 --> 42:56.748
There are bad clowns?

42:56.791 --> 42:58.401
Oh, that's going to
give me nightmares.

42:58.445 --> 42:59.664
I'm scared of clowns.

42:59.707 --> 43:02.667
Yeah, okay. Come here.

43:02.710 --> 43:04.625
Hey, you can help us
settle an argument.

43:04.669 --> 43:07.062
How many people here
like breakfast for dinner?

43:07.106 --> 43:09.717
That's it! Oh!

43:09.761 --> 43:12.720
This isn't a carnival,
this is an insane asylum.

43:14.896 --> 43:17.246
Hello there.

43:17.290 --> 43:19.858
Lara? Hi.

43:19.901 --> 43:22.295
Great performance tonight.

43:22.338 --> 43:23.731
Why, thank you.

43:23.775 --> 43:26.168
I think Sydney stole the show.

43:26.212 --> 43:28.693
Oh, that's a fabulous act,
isn't it?

43:28.736 --> 43:30.216
Yeah, yeah.

43:30.259 --> 43:32.435
I just hope it doesn't
go to their heads.

43:32.479 --> 43:34.133
Their heads?

43:34.176 --> 43:35.264
His head.

43:35.308 --> 43:36.657
Sydney's head, of course.

43:36.701 --> 43:38.311
That's what I meant.

43:38.354 --> 43:42.228
So, uh, when do I get to
see this plane of yours?

43:42.271 --> 43:45.753
Oh, well, it's really
nothing special.

43:45.797 --> 43:47.668
I'd still love to see it.

43:49.365 --> 43:51.672
Sure. Sure.

43:51.716 --> 43:54.109
- Uh, anytime you like.
- Yeah?

43:54.153 --> 43:56.634
Maybe I'll even convince you
to take me for a ride.

43:58.984 --> 44:01.900
Well, I'm really
not much of a pilot.

44:01.943 --> 44:05.947
Oh, modest and cute.
Form an orderly queue, ladies.

44:08.646 --> 44:10.082
Gosh, that Sydney though,

44:10.125 --> 44:12.780
he is such an incredible
ventriloquist.

44:12.824 --> 44:15.217
So convincing.

44:15.261 --> 44:18.003
You'd almost think
that dog was talking
all by himself.

44:19.874 --> 44:22.703
Yeah, yeah right.
Wouldn't you?

44:22.747 --> 44:25.619
Totally. But, uh,
I mean that's impossible.

44:25.663 --> 44:28.013
Because, because dog's,
dog's don't talk.

44:28.056 --> 44:31.364
I mean, they talk,
they talk dog language

44:31.407 --> 44:33.975
but they don't
talk human. No.

44:34.019 --> 44:35.281
Not at all, never.

44:35.324 --> 44:37.849
No, that's all Sydney.

44:37.892 --> 44:41.156
'Cause he is an
incredible ventriloquist.

44:41.200 --> 44:44.333
Just absolutely
really, really good.

44:44.377 --> 44:45.813
Yeah.

44:45.857 --> 44:47.728
A talking dog.

44:47.772 --> 44:49.599
Now I've heard everything.

44:59.784 --> 45:02.743
Girls and boys,
ladies and gentlemen...

45:05.354 --> 45:07.356
-- Knock, knock.
- A.R.C.H.I.- Who's there?

45:07.400 --> 45:09.097
- Edge.
- Edge who?

45:09.141 --> 45:10.272
Gesundheit!

45:13.101 --> 45:14.624
A.R.C.H.I.
Little old lady, who?

45:14.668 --> 45:16.496
I didn't know
you could yodel!

45:27.202 --> 45:30.510
Dukes and duchesses,
monsieurs and mademoiselles.

45:32.294 --> 45:35.776
Say, what do you call
an alligator in a vest?

45:35.820 --> 45:36.821
A.R.C.H.I.
I give up.

45:36.864 --> 45:38.561
An investigator.

45:48.833 --> 45:50.878
I nobly welcome you
to the most wondrous show

45:50.922 --> 45:53.011
with the most magnificent
performers

45:53.054 --> 45:55.013
in the history of humankind!

46:14.336 --> 46:16.991
Shandy, here you go, Shandy.

46:17.035 --> 46:18.950
Next, who do I
make it out to?

46:18.993 --> 46:20.473
Zimma!
Zimma!

46:20.516 --> 46:21.648
Did you have fun tonight?
That's great to hear.

46:21.691 --> 46:22.910
And what's your
favorite part, Zimma?

46:22.954 --> 46:24.433
That's good to hear.
Thanks so much for coming.

46:24.477 --> 46:25.826
Who do I make it out to?

46:25.870 --> 46:26.958
Paul.

46:27.001 --> 46:30.918
P-A-L-L? There you are my--

46:30.962 --> 46:33.703
Paul.

46:33.747 --> 46:35.140
Hey.

46:35.183 --> 46:37.577
It's great to see you.

46:37.620 --> 46:40.145
I thought you weren't
going to let this go to
your head, Sydney.

46:40.188 --> 46:41.842
I'm-- I'm not.

46:41.886 --> 46:43.975
I swear.

46:44.018 --> 46:47.674
"Pall, keep calm
and be like me."

46:47.717 --> 46:49.850
"YOLO, Sydney."

46:49.894 --> 46:51.417
YOLO?

46:51.460 --> 46:54.333
I know
how this all looks.

46:54.376 --> 46:55.943
Do you?

46:55.987 --> 46:57.858
Because how it looks

46:57.902 --> 46:59.251
is that you put
A.R.C.H.I.E. at risk

46:59.294 --> 47:00.948
for something that you want.

47:00.992 --> 47:02.689
I know you're not
that kind of guy.

47:02.732 --> 47:05.344
But that's how it looks.

47:05.387 --> 47:08.086
I'm sorry, Paul. Look.

47:08.129 --> 47:09.870
Tomorrow it's our
last performance.

47:09.914 --> 47:11.437
Well, A.R.C.H.I.E.'s anyway.

47:11.480 --> 47:13.526
And then everything
goes back to normal,
I promise.

47:15.658 --> 47:16.921
I hope so.

47:22.361 --> 47:24.276
Uh, hi.

47:24.319 --> 47:25.277
How are you?

47:25.320 --> 47:26.365
Good, yourself?

47:26.408 --> 47:27.409
Good. Did you
have fun tonight?

47:27.453 --> 47:28.715
Oh, yeah.
I had a great time.

47:28.758 --> 47:29.716
- Great show.
- Thanks for coming.

47:29.759 --> 47:30.848
I really appreciate it.

47:37.245 --> 47:38.899
I can't do this.

47:38.943 --> 47:40.988
I look like a complete idiot
out there.

47:43.556 --> 47:46.733
Don't worry,
you don't look like
a complete idiot.

47:46.776 --> 47:49.127
At least not as much
as Sydney.

47:49.170 --> 47:53.783
Your secret's safe with me.

47:53.827 --> 47:55.829
I'm just saying, I don't think
we're getting paid enough

47:55.873 --> 47:58.397
is what I'm saying.

47:58.440 --> 48:00.312
I mean, who are the people
coming to see, right?

48:02.270 --> 48:04.185
Who are the people
coming to see?

48:04.229 --> 48:05.970
Who are the--

48:06.013 --> 48:07.145
They're coming to see us,
Squirt, they're coming
to see us.

48:07.188 --> 48:08.189
Right? They're not
coming to see Max.

48:08.233 --> 48:10.061
Right? 'Cause we're
the performers.

48:10.104 --> 48:12.977
But yet Max is making
all the money, right?

48:13.020 --> 48:17.024
Think about it.
Five shows sold out
in a row.

48:17.068 --> 48:18.634
Think about
all that money.

48:18.678 --> 48:20.593
I'm not good at math.

48:20.636 --> 48:22.377
Don't even get me started
on Mr. Bigshot Ventriloquist

48:22.421 --> 48:23.857
and the dog.

48:23.901 --> 48:26.164
I mean, they're good.
I've seen good. I know good.

48:28.557 --> 48:30.516
There he is! The snitch!
The rat!

48:30.559 --> 48:32.474
The turncoat!

48:32.518 --> 48:33.736
What are you going to go
tell your dad what I said?

48:33.780 --> 48:35.216
Compared with the likes of you?

48:35.260 --> 48:38.480
A rat is a far superior species.

48:38.524 --> 48:40.395
What you going to say now?

48:41.614 --> 48:43.703
You got done by a kid!

48:48.969 --> 48:50.797
Oh, my belly button hurts!

48:58.936 --> 49:00.676
I'm fine.

49:02.504 --> 49:04.637
Come on, Bogart.

49:04.680 --> 49:06.552
It's time for you to go live
where you belong.

49:10.164 --> 49:11.905
A.R.C.H.I.
Hey.

49:11.949 --> 49:14.212
How'd you know about me?

49:18.694 --> 49:21.175
I saw this on the internet
a while ago.

49:21.219 --> 49:23.264
I figured you were the same dog.

49:23.308 --> 49:26.224
Besides, nobody's that good
of a ventriloquist.

49:26.267 --> 49:29.183
I promise I won't tell anyone.

49:29.227 --> 49:31.142
Thanks.

49:31.185 --> 49:32.621
Nice to meet you, A.R.C.H.I.E.

49:32.665 --> 49:34.058
You too, Gregory.

49:34.101 --> 49:36.669
Still no luck with Bogart, huh?

49:36.712 --> 49:39.715
No matter how much I try to tell
him that he needs to be free

49:39.759 --> 49:42.240
he just doesn't understand.

49:42.283 --> 49:43.415
He doesn't speak human.

49:43.458 --> 49:45.721
I don't speak bird.

49:52.902 --> 49:56.036
If you could speak to Bogart
so he could understand you

49:56.080 --> 49:59.518
what would you say?

49:59.561 --> 50:01.955
I'd tell him that
he's a great friend.

50:01.999 --> 50:04.044
My only friend.

50:04.088 --> 50:07.178
And because of that
I want him to stay.

50:07.221 --> 50:08.744
But that's not
what's best for him.

51:12.808 --> 51:16.029
Bogart was always there
when I needed a friend.

51:16.073 --> 51:19.206
It'll be extra hard
being here now
that he's gone.

51:19.250 --> 51:22.340
If it's any consolation,
I'll be your friend.

51:22.383 --> 51:24.081
If you need one.

51:24.124 --> 51:26.126
Likewise.

51:26.170 --> 51:28.172
It must be pretty cool

51:28.215 --> 51:29.912
being able to do
all the stuff you can do.

51:29.956 --> 51:31.914
It has its moments.

51:31.958 --> 51:34.091
But lately I've been wishing
I could just be normal.

51:34.134 --> 51:36.919
I know what you mean.

51:36.963 --> 51:39.487
I guess there's not really much
you can do about it, can you?

51:39.531 --> 51:41.010
Actually, there is.

51:41.054 --> 51:43.665
I found a delete button.

51:43.709 --> 51:45.537
A delete button?

51:45.580 --> 51:46.886
In my hard drive.

51:46.929 --> 51:48.453
It would erase all my
extra canine abilities

51:48.496 --> 51:51.151
and make me a regular dog.

51:51.195 --> 51:53.240
Are you going to use it?

51:53.284 --> 51:56.069
I don't know.

51:56.113 --> 51:58.332
Anyway.

51:58.376 --> 52:00.552
Thank you for doing that.

52:00.595 --> 52:03.685
I'm just happy I could help you.

52:03.729 --> 52:05.296
What did he say?

52:05.339 --> 52:08.690
Bogart?
When he responded to you.

52:08.734 --> 52:10.866
He said you're his best friend.

52:10.910 --> 52:13.739
And you'll always be
in his heart.

52:21.442 --> 52:23.662
I have given specific
instructions

52:23.705 --> 52:26.099
not to be interrupted
before my performances.

52:26.143 --> 52:28.101
I need my beauty sleep.

52:28.145 --> 52:30.277
Sydney, we have to talk.

52:30.321 --> 52:31.844
About?

52:31.887 --> 52:34.499
About what you're
going to do after
tonight's performance.

52:34.542 --> 52:37.197
I told you,
I'm retiring
from the circus life.

52:37.241 --> 52:39.852
How you going to continue on
with the carnival?

52:39.895 --> 52:43.986
You think I need you
in order to be successful?

52:44.030 --> 52:46.598
I'll go solo.

52:46.641 --> 52:49.514
You can't be a solo
ventriloquist.

52:49.557 --> 52:50.602
Can't I?

52:53.257 --> 52:55.520
I'll buy a sock puppet then.

52:55.563 --> 52:57.652
It doesn't eat,
it doesn't poop,

52:57.696 --> 52:59.872
and it doesn't have an ego.

52:59.915 --> 53:02.657
That won't work.

53:02.701 --> 53:05.094
Won't it?

53:05.138 --> 53:07.271
Watch me.

53:14.278 --> 53:16.410
How's it going?

53:16.454 --> 53:18.282
We're already sold out.

53:18.325 --> 53:19.761
This A.R.C.H.I.E.
is quite a draw.

53:19.805 --> 53:21.502
- Yeah.
- Hey.

53:21.546 --> 53:24.331
I heard about Joko said
about your dad.

53:24.375 --> 53:26.420
It's awful.

53:26.464 --> 53:28.509
He doesn't seem
very trustworthy at all,
does he?

53:28.553 --> 53:30.294
No.

53:30.337 --> 53:32.121
I guess there are just some
people in this world

53:32.165 --> 53:34.559
who only care
about themselves.

53:34.602 --> 53:35.734
It's okay.

53:35.777 --> 53:37.562
I can take it.

53:37.605 --> 53:39.216
You're a good kid,
Gregory.

53:39.259 --> 53:40.565
Rapscallion!

53:40.608 --> 53:42.567
I beg your pardon?

53:42.610 --> 53:45.657
An 11-letter word for roguish,
dishonest person.

53:45.700 --> 53:47.528
Oh!

53:49.269 --> 53:51.271
It fits!

53:51.315 --> 53:54.318
Well aren't you two
just the cutest thing ever.

53:55.971 --> 53:56.972
Thanks.

53:57.016 --> 53:58.409
You're welcome.

54:05.372 --> 54:07.766
Well, look who it is.

54:07.809 --> 54:11.030
Listen, Sydney,
I'm really sorry
about earlier.

54:11.073 --> 54:13.511
This is our last show,
let's be professionals.

54:13.554 --> 54:15.513
The show must go on.

54:15.556 --> 54:18.472
Yes, it is quite true
that the show must go on.

54:18.516 --> 54:20.300
And it will go on.

54:20.344 --> 54:22.302
Just not with you
despite your groveling.

54:22.346 --> 54:23.738
Groveling?

54:23.782 --> 54:26.001
Please, please,
you're embarrassing
yourself.

54:26.045 --> 54:27.655
I'm sorry
to tell you this,
A.R.C.H.I.E.,

54:27.699 --> 54:30.005
but you have been replaced.

54:30.049 --> 54:32.312
But our act is called
Sydney and his talking dog.

54:32.356 --> 54:36.011
Our act was called
Sydney and his talking dog.

54:36.055 --> 54:39.450
Now it's called
Sydney and his talking sock.

54:39.493 --> 54:41.060
Talking sock?

54:46.283 --> 54:48.023
That's a sock puppet.

54:48.067 --> 54:52.463
This is my new
partner Richie.

54:52.506 --> 54:55.901
Too bad for you.

54:55.944 --> 54:57.337
Sydney, don't, don't do this.

54:57.381 --> 54:59.339
You'll destroy your career.

54:59.383 --> 55:01.820
Why, because I wouldn't be
working with you?

55:01.863 --> 55:04.910
No, because you got
a ridiculous sock
on your hand!

55:04.953 --> 55:07.913
Jealousy doesn't
become you, A.R.C.H.I.E.

55:07.956 --> 55:09.915
Snooze you lose.

55:09.958 --> 55:14.789
Sour grapes.

55:30.675 --> 55:32.459
I hid it
in the deep freezer.

55:32.503 --> 55:35.375
Yeah, listen, you were late
on the fifth cue again.

55:35.419 --> 55:37.246
If you think there's
a lot of chicken
in this soup.

55:37.290 --> 55:38.857
There's a lot of chicken
in the soup.

55:38.900 --> 55:40.685
You gotta be tighter
on the cues next time.

55:40.728 --> 55:42.687
Well, maybe I'd be tighter
if I got a paycheck.

55:42.730 --> 55:44.819
Well, I haven't
gotten paid yet.

55:44.863 --> 55:46.821
Full house out there
tonight, everyone.

55:46.865 --> 55:48.823
Have a great show.

55:48.867 --> 55:50.172
Break a leg.

55:53.437 --> 55:54.916
Break a leg?

55:54.960 --> 55:58.006
Well, I sure hope not.

55:58.050 --> 55:59.965
A leg, moron.

56:00.008 --> 56:02.446
Not your leg, a leg.

56:02.489 --> 56:04.709
I don't want to
break anybody's leg.

56:04.752 --> 56:06.841
I gotta save my strength
for the stage.

56:08.452 --> 56:09.714
Does it hurt?

56:09.757 --> 56:11.455
Does it hurt
being that dumb?

56:11.498 --> 56:13.282
Hm?

56:13.326 --> 56:14.283
No, not really.

56:17.635 --> 56:19.463
Not really at all.

57:04.508 --> 57:06.466
She's wonderful, isn't she?

57:08.294 --> 57:09.774
Yes, she is.

57:09.817 --> 57:12.124
I can't tell you
how happy this makes me.

57:12.167 --> 57:15.997
Seeing people enjoy the magic
of the circus again.

57:17.042 --> 57:18.173
You know I have
your friend and his dog

57:18.217 --> 57:20.001
to thank for much of this.

57:20.045 --> 57:23.048
They saved us
from financial ruin.

57:23.091 --> 57:25.616
Well, now that
you're making money,

57:25.659 --> 57:27.966
maybe you can let her go.

57:29.315 --> 57:31.491
Let her go?

57:33.145 --> 57:36.714
Lara told me all about
what you did to her father.

57:38.150 --> 57:39.586
What I did to him?

57:42.415 --> 57:44.461
I don't think you have
the slightest idea

57:44.504 --> 57:46.637
what you're
talking about.

57:46.680 --> 57:49.422
He embezzled thousands
of dollars from me.

57:49.466 --> 57:51.119
He cleaned out
our bank accounts.

57:51.163 --> 57:52.773
And because
of his thievery

57:52.817 --> 57:54.383
we're still
paying debts off
to people.

57:56.560 --> 57:58.562
He nearly bankrupted
this carnival.

58:00.694 --> 58:03.088
Oh.

58:03.131 --> 58:05.525
Well, she didn't tell me
any of that.

58:08.789 --> 58:13.228
I gave Lara a job out of
the goodness of my heart.

58:31.943 --> 58:34.467
It's magic time.

58:34.511 --> 58:37.992
Oh, yeah, buddy.

58:38.036 --> 58:40.473
Break a leg.

58:42.127 --> 58:43.955
Boy, she likes you.

58:43.998 --> 58:46.348
Of course, she does.
She's seen my show.

58:59.753 --> 59:02.147
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

59:02.190 --> 59:05.672
There's been a slight change
to tonight's program.

59:05.716 --> 59:08.936
Unfortunately,
A.R.C.H.I.E. will not be
appearing this evening.

59:11.069 --> 59:14.115
However, do not fret.

59:14.159 --> 59:16.204
Because filling in for him

59:16.248 --> 59:21.427
is none other than the supremely
talented and extremely funny

59:21.470 --> 59:23.777
Richie.

59:29.304 --> 59:30.741
Knock knock.

59:30.784 --> 59:33.047
Who's there?

59:33.091 --> 59:34.440
Smell mop.

59:34.483 --> 59:36.137
Smell mop who.

59:36.181 --> 59:38.836
Smell your poo?
Ew, no thanks.

59:38.879 --> 59:40.707
Smell your own poo,
Richie.

59:45.930 --> 59:49.455
Okay. Well, we've got
lots of other good ones.

59:49.498 --> 59:53.372
Like, um,
why did the chicken
cross the road?

59:56.897 --> 59:58.943
Okay, uh.

59:58.986 --> 1:00:02.163
Hold on! I got some, hey!

1:00:02.207 --> 1:00:03.730
Oh, no.

1:00:03.774 --> 1:00:05.819
Again, it's all my fault.

1:00:05.863 --> 1:00:07.734
Why do you keep
doing this, A.R.C.H.I.E.?

1:00:07.778 --> 1:00:09.475
Why do you cause trouble
for everyone?

1:00:09.518 --> 1:00:11.651
Everywhere you go.

1:00:11.695 --> 1:00:13.610
Why can't you just be normal?

1:00:45.598 --> 1:00:47.687
Hey, A.R.C.H.I.E.

1:00:47.731 --> 1:00:51.996
You and I are, let's say,
different from the others here.

1:00:52.039 --> 1:00:54.172
So I had an idea that
I'd like to run by you.

1:01:10.797 --> 1:01:13.060
Uh.

1:01:13.104 --> 1:01:15.236
Okay, I'll take that
as a yes.

1:01:15.280 --> 1:01:17.195
Come on.

1:01:17.238 --> 1:01:18.892
We got other ones.

1:01:21.939 --> 1:01:23.462
Hey, now, you got me
right in the mouth.

1:01:24.811 --> 1:01:26.770
What's going on here?

1:01:28.119 --> 1:01:29.903
Where's A.R.C.H.I.E.?

1:01:29.947 --> 1:01:31.731
A.R.C.H.I.E.'s gone.

1:01:31.775 --> 1:01:34.429
So is Lara.

1:01:34.473 --> 1:01:36.083
Where would they go?

1:01:36.127 --> 1:01:38.216
Somewhere she could escape.

1:01:40.653 --> 1:01:42.046
The plane.

1:02:07.767 --> 1:02:09.682
And here they are.

1:02:09.726 --> 1:02:12.119
Right on time.

1:02:12.163 --> 1:02:15.035
Do you remember
that plane ride
we were talking about?

1:02:15.079 --> 1:02:16.733
I'd like to take you
up on that.

1:02:16.776 --> 1:02:18.125
Now.

1:02:18.169 --> 1:02:19.300
I'm not taking you
anywhere, Lara.

1:02:19.344 --> 1:02:20.867
Oh, I think you are, Paul.

1:02:20.911 --> 1:02:21.868
I don't understand.

1:02:21.912 --> 1:02:22.913
You've stolen the money.

1:02:22.956 --> 1:02:24.653
Why do you need us?

1:02:24.697 --> 1:02:27.918
I need you to fly me out of
this wilderness prison.

1:02:27.961 --> 1:02:30.703
I'm not even licensed
to fly a plane.

1:02:30.747 --> 1:02:32.400
You think I'm stupid?

1:02:32.444 --> 1:02:35.621
If you can't fly
then how'd you get
the plane here?

1:02:35.664 --> 1:02:37.928
What makes you think
we'll agree to go with you?

1:02:37.971 --> 1:02:39.799
If you don't agree
to go with me

1:02:39.843 --> 1:02:41.453
then you're going to have
a few things to explain.

1:02:41.496 --> 1:02:43.281
Like?

1:02:43.324 --> 1:02:45.283
Like the fact that you have
this magical robot dog.

1:02:45.326 --> 1:02:48.460
I bet the world
would just love
to hear all about him.

1:02:48.503 --> 1:02:50.723
I could blow the doors off
your little secret for good.

1:02:52.943 --> 1:02:55.249
I guess you know about
A.R.C.H.I.E. too?

1:02:55.293 --> 1:02:57.817
And since you're
so clearly unhappy

1:02:57.861 --> 1:02:59.819
about being here
at the carnival,

1:02:59.863 --> 1:03:01.255
it won't be hard to make it
look like you're involved

1:03:01.299 --> 1:03:02.779
in this little scam too.

1:03:02.822 --> 1:03:04.389
But I'm not involved.

1:03:04.432 --> 1:03:06.434
Prove it.

1:03:06.478 --> 1:03:09.089
I could make a case
that you've been helping me
all along.

1:03:09.133 --> 1:03:13.224
And, oh,
what an embarrassment
for your poor dad.

1:03:14.312 --> 1:03:16.314
But I'm willing
to forget all that

1:03:16.357 --> 1:03:18.795
if you fly me and A.R.C.H.I.E.
to where we need to go.

1:03:18.838 --> 1:03:20.013
You and A.R.C.H.I.E.?

1:03:20.057 --> 1:03:22.276
Oh, yeah.
Didn't I mention that?

1:03:22.320 --> 1:03:23.843
A.R.C.H.I.E's coming with me.

1:03:23.887 --> 1:03:25.453
We talked about it already.

1:03:25.497 --> 1:03:26.846
You did?

1:03:26.890 --> 1:03:27.891
You did?

1:03:31.198 --> 1:03:33.505
We're going to start
our own carnival.

1:03:33.548 --> 1:03:34.854
How are you
going to do that?

1:03:34.898 --> 1:03:38.858
Um, this'll definitely help.

1:03:38.902 --> 1:03:42.079
So you're not just a thief,
you're a kidnapper too.

1:03:42.122 --> 1:03:44.646
Kidnapper? Please.

1:03:44.690 --> 1:03:46.344
Don't be so dramatic.

1:03:46.387 --> 1:03:47.867
A.R.C.H.I.E.'s going with me
of his own free will.

1:03:47.911 --> 1:03:50.217
A.R.C.H.I.E., is this true?

1:03:52.306 --> 1:03:54.439
It's pretty simple.

1:03:54.482 --> 1:03:56.920
You help me get out of here
and you never see me again.

1:03:56.963 --> 1:04:00.837
But if you don't help me,
then we're all in trouble.

1:04:01.750 --> 1:04:03.013
Fine.

1:04:03.056 --> 1:04:04.971
Take me
but leave Gregory here.

1:04:05.015 --> 1:04:06.886
So he can go
and get the police

1:04:06.930 --> 1:04:08.192
before the plane's
even in the air?

1:04:08.235 --> 1:04:10.672
Not happening.

1:04:23.511 --> 1:04:25.905
Gregory?

1:04:25.949 --> 1:04:27.341
Where's Gregory?

1:04:27.385 --> 1:04:28.690
I don't know.
But Lara's gone too.

1:04:28.734 --> 1:04:29.691
- What?
- Yeah.

1:04:29.735 --> 1:04:32.129
Guys.

1:04:32.172 --> 1:04:35.523
I just saw Lara take off
with all the money

1:04:35.567 --> 1:04:37.134
and that stupid dog Arty!

1:04:37.177 --> 1:04:38.570
A.R.C.H.I.E.?

1:04:38.613 --> 1:04:39.919
- Who?
- Gregory?!

1:04:39.963 --> 1:04:41.268
A.R.C.H.I.E.?

1:04:41.312 --> 1:04:42.966
Ah!

1:04:48.275 --> 1:04:49.842
What's going on?

1:04:57.894 --> 1:05:00.200
I really don't know
how to do this.

1:05:00.244 --> 1:05:01.723
You've gotta help me.

1:05:03.029 --> 1:05:05.249
What is wrong with you?

1:05:32.798 --> 1:05:33.886
A.R.C.H.I.E.'s gone.

1:05:33.930 --> 1:05:35.888
Oh, this is all my fault.

1:05:35.932 --> 1:05:38.151
Me and my bloated ego.

1:05:38.195 --> 1:05:40.588
Oh, I could've never thought
that this stupid sock puppet

1:05:40.632 --> 1:05:42.155
was more talented than him!

1:05:42.199 --> 1:05:43.983
This is just great.

1:05:44.027 --> 1:05:46.986
Every cent that we've
earned this week is gone.

1:05:47.030 --> 1:05:48.988
The carnival is
officially ruined!

1:05:49.032 --> 1:05:51.991
Will you forget
about the money
for one second?

1:05:52.035 --> 1:05:54.211
My son is missing.

1:05:54.254 --> 1:05:56.300
Now, did anyone see
where they went?

1:06:02.393 --> 1:06:04.308
Oh, hey guys!

1:06:04.351 --> 1:06:06.484
Look what I found
stashed on the bus!

1:06:09.008 --> 1:06:12.620
But if we have that,
what does Lara have?

1:06:12.664 --> 1:06:16.450
I don't know.
But this stuff
smells really good.

1:06:17.843 --> 1:06:18.887
Yes. Yes.

1:06:18.931 --> 1:06:19.976
And there's lots of it.

1:06:20.019 --> 1:06:21.629
Yes, there's tons!

1:06:21.673 --> 1:06:24.154
- It's bottomless!
- Bottomless money!

1:06:28.245 --> 1:06:30.682
A.R.C.H.I.E.,
I really need
your help here.

1:06:32.771 --> 1:06:33.815
I don't know how many times
I have to tell you this,

1:06:33.859 --> 1:06:35.948
but I can't fly!

1:06:35.992 --> 1:06:37.428
Don't give me that crap!

1:06:37.471 --> 1:06:39.473
I'm serious!

1:06:39.517 --> 1:06:41.562
I wasn't the one
who flew the plane here,
it was A.R.C.H.I.E.

1:06:41.606 --> 1:06:43.260
Well, make him do it now then.

1:06:43.303 --> 1:06:44.565
I'm trying!

1:06:44.609 --> 1:06:47.394
But something's wrong,
he's just--

1:06:47.438 --> 1:06:49.701
He's acting like a
completely normal dog!

1:06:52.095 --> 1:06:53.487
Oh, no.

1:06:53.531 --> 1:06:54.749
Oh, no, what?

1:06:54.793 --> 1:06:57.535
He must've deleted
his hard drive.

1:06:57.578 --> 1:06:59.493
What?!

1:06:59.537 --> 1:07:01.582
He told me found a delete button
in his hard drive.

1:07:01.626 --> 1:07:05.325
Does that mean
that he's just a normal,
stupid dog now?!

1:07:05.369 --> 1:07:06.674
That's exactly
what it means!

1:07:06.718 --> 1:07:10.113
It also means
we're in the air in a plane

1:07:10.156 --> 1:07:12.506
that nobody knows how to land!

1:07:22.168 --> 1:07:25.302
What in the heck is this?

1:07:25.345 --> 1:07:27.217
The first rule of
stealing money

1:07:27.260 --> 1:07:30.089
is make sure that you're
actually stealing money.

1:07:30.133 --> 1:07:32.178
I got duped.

1:07:32.222 --> 1:07:33.875
By an 11-year old.

1:07:33.919 --> 1:07:35.660
An 11-year old!

1:07:35.703 --> 1:07:37.357
I don't know if you've been
paying attention,

1:07:37.401 --> 1:07:40.012
but we've got much bigger
problems here.

1:07:42.145 --> 1:07:45.409
So, are we all going to die now?

1:07:45.452 --> 1:07:47.454
Yeah. That's a distinct
possibility.

1:07:54.244 --> 1:07:55.767
A.R.C.H.I.E., listen to me.

1:07:55.810 --> 1:07:57.334
This is your friend Gregory.

1:07:57.377 --> 1:07:59.553
I need your help.

1:08:04.167 --> 1:08:07.257
Remember how you said you'd be
my friend if I needed one?

1:08:07.300 --> 1:08:09.694
Well, I need one now!

1:08:09.737 --> 1:08:10.825
A.R.C.H.I.E.!

1:08:12.697 --> 1:08:14.568
Friend.

1:08:14.612 --> 1:08:16.570
Best friend.

1:08:37.243 --> 1:08:39.158
A.R.C.H.I.E.:
Gregory?

1:08:39.202 --> 1:08:40.812
A.R.C.H.I.E., you're back.

1:08:40.855 --> 1:08:44.250
Yeah, I was having a crazy dream
where I was in this airplane.

1:08:44.294 --> 1:08:46.600
That's not a dream.

1:08:46.644 --> 1:08:48.689
Please tell me you still
remember how to land a plane.

1:08:48.733 --> 1:08:49.995
Of course I do.

1:08:50.038 --> 1:08:52.171
Then land it!

1:08:53.607 --> 1:08:55.218
Oh, land it, land it, land it!

1:08:55.261 --> 1:08:57.481
Oh, boy!

1:09:00.614 --> 1:09:02.964
Oh, I'm going to barf!

1:09:34.170 --> 1:09:36.215
Gregory?

1:09:38.739 --> 1:09:39.827
Are you okay?

1:09:39.871 --> 1:09:41.177
I'm fine.

1:09:47.270 --> 1:09:48.662
Why did you do that?

1:09:48.706 --> 1:09:50.142
I did it for you.

1:09:50.186 --> 1:09:51.752
I wanted you to be happy.

1:09:51.796 --> 1:09:54.494
You love this carnival
more than anything.

1:09:54.538 --> 1:09:56.714
Not more than you.

1:09:56.757 --> 1:09:59.412
Nothing is more important
to me than you.

1:09:59.456 --> 1:10:02.154
What are we going to do with
this traitor, boss?

1:10:02.198 --> 1:10:04.330
- Dunk tank?
- No.

1:10:04.374 --> 1:10:06.245
Let's just call
the authorities.

1:10:06.289 --> 1:10:09.640
How did you figure it out?

1:10:09.683 --> 1:10:12.773
I'd been suspicious of Lara
for a long time.

1:10:12.817 --> 1:10:16.386
She'd steal just enough for it
to be barely noticeable.

1:10:16.429 --> 1:10:19.215
But I knew she wouldn't be able
to resist her greed for long.

1:10:19.258 --> 1:10:21.129
When A.R.C.H.I.E. came around

1:10:21.173 --> 1:10:22.566
I knew it was just
a matter of time.

1:10:22.609 --> 1:10:24.307
Just a matter of time

1:10:24.350 --> 1:10:26.265
until you realized that
I didn't take the money.

1:10:26.309 --> 1:10:27.919
Yes! Yes!

1:10:27.962 --> 1:10:30.138
High-five, Squirt!
Yeah!

1:10:31.401 --> 1:10:33.403
Suckers!
I bet you all thought
it was me, didn't you?

1:10:33.446 --> 1:10:35.535
Didn't you? But it wasn't.

1:10:35.579 --> 1:10:38.495
It wasn't me, it was goldie
schmoldie-locks over here.

1:10:38.538 --> 1:10:40.279
Well, it serves
you all right, suckers.

1:10:40.323 --> 1:10:41.628
I'm going to
tell you something,

1:10:41.672 --> 1:10:43.064
I'm going to tell you
for free right now.

1:10:43.108 --> 1:10:45.763
Joko is a sad clown
but he's not a thief clown.

1:10:45.806 --> 1:10:47.330
He's not a thievery clown.

1:10:47.373 --> 1:10:49.636
He doesn't take the money
like you.

1:10:51.464 --> 1:10:52.639
Yeah, but you're kind of
a mean clown.

1:10:52.683 --> 1:10:54.119
Oh, shut up.

1:10:54.162 --> 1:10:55.381
You shut up.

1:10:58.689 --> 1:11:00.256
Well, Lara...

1:11:00.299 --> 1:11:03.607
I guess the apple
doesn't fall far
from the tree.

1:11:03.650 --> 1:11:06.305
You and your father
deserve each other.

1:11:08.786 --> 1:11:10.396
Don't worry.

1:11:10.440 --> 1:11:12.442
We'll be back, Max.

1:11:12.485 --> 1:11:14.922
We'll be back.

1:11:14.966 --> 1:11:18.622
We could've been famous,
me and you.

1:11:18.665 --> 1:11:21.015
More like infamous.
No thanks.

1:11:23.757 --> 1:11:26.282
Let's go.

1:11:29.459 --> 1:11:31.548
I think I'm going to barf.

1:11:35.639 --> 1:11:37.771
That was pretty brave
what you did.

1:11:37.815 --> 1:11:39.860
Thanks.

1:11:39.904 --> 1:11:43.821
Maybe we can hang out sometime
and do something more normal.

1:11:43.864 --> 1:11:45.779
Like a crossword puzzle?

1:11:45.823 --> 1:11:47.390
Sure.

1:11:47.433 --> 1:11:48.565
I'd like that.

1:11:48.608 --> 1:11:51.394
Speaking of crossword puzzles,

1:11:51.437 --> 1:11:53.439
do you know a 7-letter word
for adorable?

1:11:56.442 --> 1:11:58.705
G-R-E-G-O-R-Y.

1:12:23.643 --> 1:12:26.690
Uh, Mr. Zon.

1:12:26.733 --> 1:12:28.996
I would just like to say, sir,

1:12:29.040 --> 1:12:32.739
I am deeply sorry for any
trouble that I may have caused.

1:12:32.783 --> 1:12:34.959
Deeply.
Deeply sorry.

1:12:38.223 --> 1:12:40.051
You're forgiven, Sydney.

1:12:40.094 --> 1:12:42.445
You are most kind.

1:12:42.488 --> 1:12:44.882
And may I also take this
opportunity to say

1:12:44.925 --> 1:12:48.320
what a complete honor
it was to perform
in your carnival.

1:12:49.800 --> 1:12:51.192
Was?

1:12:51.236 --> 1:12:52.716
Well, yes.

1:12:52.759 --> 1:12:54.892
Now that A.R.C.H.I.E.'s
retiring from performing

1:12:54.935 --> 1:12:57.503
that pretty much pushes me out
of the business too.

1:12:58.504 --> 1:12:59.984
That's silly.

1:13:00.027 --> 1:13:02.813
You're a phenomenal
ventriloquist.

1:13:02.856 --> 1:13:04.945
You could be world-famous.

1:13:04.989 --> 1:13:08.079
No, trust me,
it was all A.R.C.H.I.E.

1:13:08.122 --> 1:13:10.777
I'm nothing without him.

1:13:10.821 --> 1:13:12.953
He's the real talent
in our partnership.

1:13:14.477 --> 1:13:17.654
You're a good man, Sydney,
with a kind soul.

1:13:17.697 --> 1:13:19.569
That's rare in
this line of work.

1:13:29.317 --> 1:13:32.364
I have a proposition for you.

1:13:32.408 --> 1:13:36.237
How would you like to
replace me as ringmaster
of this carnival?

1:13:36.281 --> 1:13:37.717
You're retiring?

1:13:37.761 --> 1:13:38.718
Yes.

1:13:38.762 --> 1:13:41.025
Why?

1:13:44.550 --> 1:13:46.465
'Cause I want to spend
more time with my son.

1:13:56.736 --> 1:13:57.868
Give it a shot.

1:14:04.701 --> 1:14:07.486
Boys and girls.

1:14:07.530 --> 1:14:09.836
Ladies and gentlemen.

1:14:09.880 --> 1:14:11.838
Dukes and duchesses.

1:14:11.882 --> 1:14:14.580
Monsieurs and mademoiselles.

1:14:14.624 --> 1:14:16.843
I nobly welcome you

1:14:16.887 --> 1:14:20.368
to a show of the most
magnificent performers

1:14:20.412 --> 1:14:23.894
in the history of humankind!

1:14:27.680 --> 1:14:29.639
You're a natural.

1:14:32.119 --> 1:14:35.340
Are you sure you
want to do this, Dad?

1:14:35.383 --> 1:14:36.950
Absolutely.

1:14:41.215 --> 1:14:43.566
What do you say, Sydney?

1:14:43.609 --> 1:14:44.958
There's only
one thing to say.

1:14:45.002 --> 1:14:46.003
Thank you!

1:14:46.046 --> 1:14:49.310
Okay!

1:14:49.354 --> 1:14:50.311
Okay, okay, put me down.

1:14:52.139 --> 1:14:55.186
Oh, watch out.
He's an aggressive hugger.

1:14:57.971 --> 1:15:00.931
That's it, let it out.
Let it all out.

1:15:00.974 --> 1:15:02.628
Talk to Ralph.

1:15:02.672 --> 1:15:04.412
Probably still airsick.

1:15:10.810 --> 1:15:13.421
I'm definitely
getting rid of that plane.

1:15:13.465 --> 1:15:15.989
I guess I picked the wrong time
to delete my hard drive, huh?

1:15:16.033 --> 1:15:18.035
The timing wasn't fantastic.

1:15:21.081 --> 1:15:22.561
Is it still something
you think you want to do?

1:15:22.605 --> 1:15:24.650
I don't know.

1:15:24.694 --> 1:15:29.525
As soon as I did it
I felt this profound sadness.

1:15:29.568 --> 1:15:31.962
Because I lost everyone
I care about.

1:15:32.005 --> 1:15:33.224
But at the same time,

1:15:33.267 --> 1:15:34.834
I'm sick of getting everyone
into trouble.

1:15:34.878 --> 1:15:36.880
If I was just a normal dog
none of this would've happened.

1:15:36.923 --> 1:15:40.013
Hey, none of this
was your fault.

1:15:40.057 --> 1:15:42.450
But no matter what I keep
having this feeling

1:15:42.494 --> 1:15:45.758
that there's something bigger
that I need to be a part of.

1:15:45.802 --> 1:15:47.891
Something I need to do,
I just don't know what it is.

1:16:03.907 --> 1:16:06.649
A.R.C.H.I.
Who's this now?

1:16:06.692 --> 1:16:08.564
I have no idea.

1:16:20.227 --> 1:16:21.577
A.R.C.H.I.
Veronica.

1:16:22.795 --> 1:16:24.014
What are you doing here?

1:16:24.057 --> 1:16:26.625
Don't worry,
I come in peace.

1:16:26.669 --> 1:16:28.192
I work for
a new company now.

1:16:28.235 --> 1:16:30.673
And I have a job offer
for you, A.R.C.H.I.E.

1:16:30.716 --> 1:16:33.240
- A job?
- Mm-hmm.

1:16:33.284 --> 1:16:35.634
It might just be the perfect way
for you to keep your identity

1:16:35.678 --> 1:16:37.114
while allowing you
to use your abilities

1:16:37.157 --> 1:16:39.203
to do some good
in the world.

1:16:39.246 --> 1:16:41.205
That is what they were
intended for.

1:16:41.248 --> 1:16:42.641
I'm listening.

1:16:42.685 --> 1:16:44.643
When you were stolen away,

1:16:44.687 --> 1:16:47.037
the company I work for
endeavored to recreate you,

1:16:47.080 --> 1:16:50.867
but after years of trying their
efforts were unsuccessful.

1:16:50.910 --> 1:16:54.653
Turns out,
you are one of a kind.

1:16:54.697 --> 1:16:57.656
That's when they contacted me
to help find you.

1:16:57.700 --> 1:16:59.223
Who's they?

1:16:59.266 --> 1:17:01.051
You'll find out
soon enough.

1:17:01.094 --> 1:17:04.924
But, for now,
suffice it to say
they are very powerful.

1:17:04.968 --> 1:17:08.754
What do they want of me?
Why was I created?

1:17:08.798 --> 1:17:11.975
You were created
to be a beacon of positivity
in the world.

1:17:12.018 --> 1:17:13.324
A greater good.

1:17:13.367 --> 1:17:15.282
Yes, exactly.

1:17:15.326 --> 1:17:17.197
And now that we've found you

1:17:17.241 --> 1:17:19.678
we want to know if you would
like to help us continue

1:17:19.722 --> 1:17:21.680
this very important mission.

1:17:21.724 --> 1:17:23.551
Yes, yes I would.

1:17:23.595 --> 1:17:25.597
Very well then.

1:17:25.641 --> 1:17:26.816
You'd better come with me.

1:17:26.859 --> 1:17:28.818
We've got a lot of work to do.

1:17:30.689 --> 1:17:33.083
Let's go, Paul!

1:22:03.353 --> 1:22:04.745
I'm sorry,
did you just sit here

1:22:04.789 --> 1:22:06.791
and watch the entire
credit sequence?

1:22:06.834 --> 1:22:08.227
That's impressive.

1:22:08.271 --> 1:22:09.794
The movie's over, guys.

1:22:09.837 --> 1:22:11.317
That's it, seriously,
there's nothing more.

1:22:11.361 --> 1:22:15.887
Just, uh, just going to
sit there, huh?

1:22:15.931 --> 1:22:16.975
Woof.
