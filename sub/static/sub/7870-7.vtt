-Hey.

00:05.046 --> 00:06.631
-(yelling)
-(laughing)

00:07.173 --> 00:08.466
Is there any
better feeling

00:08.550 --> 00:11.052
than waiting for a live
Krusty show to start?

00:11.136 --> 00:13.763
Maybe watching your bride
coming down the aisle.

00:13.847 --> 00:14.973
Hmm.

00:15.056 --> 00:18.184
(organ plays discordant music)

00:18.268 --> 00:21.396
(grunting)

00:21.479 --> 00:22.939
(sobbing)

00:23.023 --> 00:25.817
Why does she get to eat
before the reception?

00:25.900 --> 00:27.027
(sobbing)

00:35.118 --> 00:37.787
Seltzer bottle connected
and pressurized?

00:37.871 --> 00:39.080
Check.

00:39.164 --> 00:41.041
Roll-up dicky set to six?

00:41.124 --> 00:42.792
-Nope. 11.
-(gasps)

00:42.876 --> 00:45.628
My comedy comes
from taking risks.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.630
Or avoiding them.
I can't remember.

00:47.714 --> 00:49.299
Krusty, we need to talk.

00:49.382 --> 00:50.800
Make it fast.

00:50.884 --> 00:53.553
I've got a coiled-up spring
ready to boi-oi-oi-oi-oing.

00:54.637 --> 00:57.807
Oh, why can't I be funny
with just my words?

00:57.891 --> 01:00.560
Bill Maher doesn't put dangerous
things near his crotch,

01:00.643 --> 01:02.270
except when he's off work.

01:02.353 --> 01:03.897
(laughs)
Yeah.

01:03.980 --> 01:06.357
It's about your vodka,
Absolut Krusty.

01:06.441 --> 01:08.359
We're having trouble
persuading people

01:08.443 --> 01:10.528
it's hip to drink a vodka
made by a clown,

01:10.612 --> 01:12.447
in a bottle shaped
like a clown,

01:12.530 --> 01:14.115
that does this
when you open it.

01:14.199 --> 01:15.950
-(ooga horn sounds)
-(laughs)

01:16.034 --> 01:17.452
Always gets me.

01:17.535 --> 01:18.787
Yeah, plus, that TV special

01:18.870 --> 01:21.206
where you drank another brand
of vodka didn't help.

01:21.289 --> 01:23.541
I used up my stuff
poisoning deer.

01:23.625 --> 01:25.168
If we're ever gonna
sell your vodka,

01:25.251 --> 01:27.295
we need to do something
completely unorthodox--

01:27.378 --> 01:29.047
a viral marketing campaign.

01:29.130 --> 01:30.381
(metallic creaking)

01:30.465 --> 01:31.549
Get to the point!

01:31.633 --> 01:33.468
Unless you want a face
full of clown chunks!

01:33.551 --> 01:35.553
People are more likely
to drink your vodka

01:35.637 --> 01:37.972
if they think all their
coolest friends are drinking it.

01:38.056 --> 01:39.808
So, we pay for a big party

01:39.891 --> 01:41.684
at the home of a
Springfield trendsetter.

01:41.768 --> 01:44.479
Your Brockman,
your Bumblebee Man...

01:44.562 --> 01:47.273
He invites his cool friends,
we serve free cocktails,

01:47.357 --> 01:49.901
made with your vodka,
generating buzz.

01:49.984 --> 01:51.319
We got buzz.

01:51.402 --> 01:52.737
Positive buzz.

01:52.821 --> 01:54.823
That exists? Wow.

01:54.906 --> 01:57.951
So, all you have to do is find
one of your loyal fans

01:58.034 --> 02:00.203
whose house we can trash
and friends you can exploit.

02:00.286 --> 02:01.412
(metallic creaking)

02:01.496 --> 02:03.039
(gasps, grunts)

02:03.123 --> 02:04.541
I need a drink.

02:04.624 --> 02:07.252
Not that!
Never that!

02:07.335 --> 02:09.504
-(theme music plays)
-Hey, hey, kids!

02:09.587 --> 02:11.881
Who wants to host
a viral marketing event?

02:11.965 --> 02:13.424
ALL: Yay!

02:13.508 --> 02:15.468
All you have to do
is write me a letter

02:15.552 --> 02:18.179
about how hip and influential
your parents are.

02:18.263 --> 02:20.265
Milhouse, I'm gonna
win that thing.

02:20.348 --> 02:21.724
How do you know, Bart?

02:21.808 --> 02:23.852
Maybe for once I'll win.

02:23.935 --> 02:26.354
Children of troubled marriages
not eligible.

02:26.437 --> 02:27.856
Oh!

02:27.939 --> 02:29.107
(birds singing)

02:29.190 --> 02:31.192
So, uh,
why are you here?

02:31.276 --> 02:33.361
Is it about that unauthorized
Krusty look-alike

02:33.444 --> 02:35.071
I hired for Lisa's
first communion?

02:35.155 --> 02:36.197
What was his name?

02:36.281 --> 02:38.158
Krappy the Klunk. See?

02:38.241 --> 02:40.952
Homer, we're here
to throw the most redonkulous

02:41.035 --> 02:43.079
marketing outreach
this town's ever seen.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.832
All you have to do is invite
every cool person you know.

02:45.915 --> 02:47.667
Hey, I wrote the application.

02:47.750 --> 02:49.169
Do any of my friends get
to come?

02:49.252 --> 02:50.420
One friend.

02:50.503 --> 02:52.213
He can listen to music
with headphones on,

02:52.297 --> 02:53.965
he gets one slice
of cheese pizza,

02:54.048 --> 02:55.300
and if the party
gets slow,

02:55.383 --> 02:57.760
he has to pretend to let
Krusty save him from drowning.

02:57.844 --> 03:00.263
-Redonkulous!
-Off the dilge!

03:01.264 --> 03:03.641
(dance music playing)

03:03.725 --> 03:05.185
(tires screech)

03:05.268 --> 03:09.022
(crowd chatter)

03:09.105 --> 03:11.941
This party is so much better
than the crummy ones we plan.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.193
(laughs)

03:13.276 --> 03:15.361
I hope Bart's having fun.

03:15.445 --> 03:18.740
And that's why John Gielgud
is more of a father to me

03:18.823 --> 03:20.241
than my own father.

03:20.325 --> 03:22.160
Where's the nachos
you promised?

03:22.243 --> 03:25.455
There'll be time enough
for nachos!

03:25.538 --> 03:27.790
Why can't I go to
the grown-up room?

03:27.874 --> 03:30.460
You said the clown scared you.

03:30.543 --> 03:32.045
Well, he did a little.

03:32.128 --> 03:33.713
(crowd chatter and laughter)

03:33.796 --> 03:35.840
Boy, everyone from the
nuclear plant is here.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.508
Except the bosses,
of course.

03:37.592 --> 03:40.261
Yeah, even Homer's not dumb
enough to invite...

03:40.345 --> 03:42.889
BURNS:
So, this is the famous party.

03:42.972 --> 03:44.933
Feh. Guh.

03:45.016 --> 03:46.976
Pffoy.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.811
(crowd chatter)

03:51.564 --> 03:53.942
He's destroying
our youthful demographic!

03:54.025 --> 03:56.069
Oh, God, I need a drink!

03:57.320 --> 04:00.281
So the car in front of us
forgot to validate his... uh...

04:00.365 --> 04:03.409
(laughs)
I was in an anecdote once.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.954
Um, I have surgery
in the morning.

04:06.037 --> 04:08.539
Yeah, and I'm the one
having the surgery.

04:08.623 --> 04:10.250
(sighs)

04:10.333 --> 04:13.086
Homer, you're the nominal host.
Do something!

04:13.169 --> 04:15.129
Oh! Uh! Oh!

04:15.838 --> 04:19.634
Mr. Burns,
so glad you're here.

04:19.717 --> 04:21.511
Finally, the party
can get started.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.930
Your cotillion seems
to be in full promenade.

04:24.013 --> 04:25.431
(laughs)
Good one.

04:25.515 --> 04:28.893
Uh, Mr. Burns, everyone is dying
to hear you sing karaoke.

04:28.977 --> 04:31.604
Come on,
just pick a popular song.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.731
Do you have anything
by Prince...

04:33.815 --> 04:35.400
Wilhelm of Prussia?

04:35.483 --> 04:38.528
I have 16 million songs,
but, uh, no.

04:38.611 --> 04:42.740
Just play the oldest,
stupidest thing in your catalog.

04:42.824 --> 04:45.326
Uh, let me check
my beeswax cylinders.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.078
Uh, here we are.

04:47.161 --> 04:50.206
<i>♪ Come, Josephine,</i>
<i>in my flying machine! ♪</i>

04:50.290 --> 04:54.043
<i>♪ Going up she goes,</i>
<i>up she goes ♪</i>

04:54.127 --> 04:56.796
<i>♪ Balance yourself</i>
<i>like a bird on a beam ♪</i>

04:56.879 --> 05:00.967
<i>ALL: ♪ In the air she goes,</i>
<i>there she goes ♪</i>

05:01.050 --> 05:03.136
-(applause and cheering)
-(Mr. Burns chuckles)

05:03.219 --> 05:06.180
May you all fly
in an aeroplane someday.

05:06.264 --> 05:08.308
You certainly seem to be
enjoying yourself, sir.

05:08.391 --> 05:10.101
Indeed.
That Homer Simpson

05:10.184 --> 05:12.186
is the beating baboon heart
of this party.

05:12.270 --> 05:15.565
So he says, "Bigamy is having
one too many wives."

05:15.648 --> 05:18.776
To which I replied,
"So's monogamy."

05:18.860 --> 05:21.321
-(laughter)
-Oh, yeah!

05:21.404 --> 05:23.614
I may have a use for
this Simpson character

05:23.698 --> 05:25.074
higher up in the organization.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.368
Really?
Well, as safety inspector,

05:27.452 --> 05:29.203
he hasn't exactly
set the world on fire,

05:29.287 --> 05:31.247
although he came close
several times.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.582
(crow caws)

05:32.665 --> 05:35.918
Simpson, you're probably
wondering why you're here.

05:36.002 --> 05:39.172
It's never good. I always wind up
being chased by hounds,

05:39.255 --> 05:40.798
or falling
through a trapdoor,

05:40.882 --> 05:43.593
or being a peg in your game
of human croquet.

05:43.676 --> 05:45.970
When I made you a hoop,
you split your pants.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.639
Now, here at the plant,
there's no position more important

05:48.723 --> 05:50.892
than our accounts man,
who's responsible

05:50.975 --> 05:53.436
for glad-handing our
customers and suppliers.

05:53.519 --> 05:56.022
I'd like you to take over
that position.

05:56.105 --> 05:58.441
The last thing I understood
in that was "pants."

05:58.524 --> 06:00.068
Just give me your answer,
and make it quick!

06:00.151 --> 06:01.694
Our current account man,
Robert Marlowe here,

06:01.778 --> 06:03.446
is retiring at the
end of the month.

06:03.529 --> 06:05.740
In two weeks, the only tie
I'll be wearing is

06:05.823 --> 06:07.825
for autoerotic pleasure.

06:07.909 --> 06:10.119
Yes. Simpson,
only you have the bonhomie

06:10.203 --> 06:12.246
and rotund charm
to replace him.

06:12.330 --> 06:15.625
It means a hefty expense account
and a corner office.

06:15.708 --> 06:18.086
Well, in that case...

06:18.169 --> 06:21.339
Before you say yes, Simpson,
I feel it's my duty to warn you,

06:21.422 --> 06:23.424
account men lose their soul.

06:23.508 --> 06:25.843
Woo-hoo!
No more church!

06:30.765 --> 06:32.892
(door squeaks open and shut)

06:32.975 --> 06:35.144
So long, Sector 7-G.

06:35.228 --> 06:38.106
Hello, Sector 22-F!

06:40.191 --> 06:41.275
(elevator bell dings)

06:42.610 --> 06:44.153
(gasps)

06:47.615 --> 06:49.742
(sizzling)

06:49.826 --> 06:51.577
(giggling)

06:51.661 --> 06:53.079
(moans)

06:59.961 --> 07:02.463
The higher they rise,
the further they fall!

07:02.547 --> 07:04.715
You know,
you're kind of a downer.

07:04.799 --> 07:07.468
I thought you were retiring.
Why are you still here?

07:07.552 --> 07:09.220
Hey, you're a baby
account man.

07:09.303 --> 07:10.721
Still on the bottle.

07:10.805 --> 07:13.558
So, for my last good deed
before I retire,

07:13.641 --> 07:15.476
I'm going to help you
persuade Mayor Quimby

07:15.560 --> 07:17.395
to sign off on
a nuclear rate hike.

07:17.478 --> 07:19.021
Uh-oh, a meeting
with the mayor.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.441
How do I prepare for that?

07:21.524 --> 07:22.900
(chuckles)

07:22.984 --> 07:24.360
I see.

07:24.444 --> 07:27.321
Now, how do I prepare
for the meeting with the mayor?

07:28.698 --> 07:31.868
I am really enjoying this,
but, um...

07:31.951 --> 07:34.203
Hello!
Meeting with the mayor?

07:36.205 --> 07:37.373
(glass breaking)

07:37.457 --> 07:39.792
Aw. Bourbon go bye-bye.

07:39.876 --> 07:42.587
There ain't enough bourbon
in Kentucky for you, big guy.

07:42.670 --> 07:46.382
Yeah, the governor wrote me
a letter to that effect.

07:48.092 --> 07:50.595
Wow, I can't believe I'm eating
steak with the mayor.

07:50.678 --> 07:53.556
The next time I vote for you,
it's gonna be on purpose.

07:53.639 --> 07:54.807
Much obliged.

07:54.891 --> 07:56.392
Now, uh, where would you like

07:56.476 --> 07:59.395
to discuss
your proposed tax breaks?

07:59.479 --> 08:01.939
(laughing)

08:02.023 --> 08:03.357
Mmm.

08:03.441 --> 08:04.567
Hey, Homer!

08:04.650 --> 08:05.818
Look at you, man!

08:05.902 --> 08:07.570
(loud whisper)
I've outgrown you!

08:07.653 --> 08:12.158
Oh, Mr. Mayor,
more "peanut nore"?

08:12.241 --> 08:13.743
(knocking on window)

08:15.244 --> 08:18.247
(glass squeaking)

08:21.042 --> 08:22.043
(both grunt)

08:22.126 --> 08:23.127
Say what you will, man.

08:23.211 --> 08:24.712
He's pretty resourceful.

08:24.795 --> 08:26.547
-(cheering)
<i>-HOMER: Wow.</i>

08:26.631 --> 08:28.049
These seats are amazing.

08:28.132 --> 08:30.468
And if you don't like the score,
you can change it yourself.

08:30.551 --> 08:31.511
(click)

08:31.594 --> 08:33.346
HOMER:
Boring!

08:33.429 --> 08:34.889
(click)

08:34.972 --> 08:36.098
God, what a great game!

08:36.182 --> 08:38.643
And you, too, can be on
the winning team, Mr. Mayor.

08:38.726 --> 08:40.728
The Springfield Nuclear Team.

08:40.811 --> 08:43.940
I have never heard an analogy
involving sports!

08:44.023 --> 08:45.733
I love it!

08:45.816 --> 08:47.735
I can't believe
that was work!

08:47.818 --> 08:49.320
Yeah, but work is over now.

08:49.403 --> 08:51.239
Want to drink with me
till I fall asleep?

08:51.322 --> 08:53.199
Oh, well...

08:53.282 --> 08:57.036
Mm, I really should look
at this picture a little longer.

08:57.119 --> 09:00.039
Hmm.
Okay, let's go.

09:00.122 --> 09:02.625
Great. Now, in honor of my
last day on the hamster wheel,

09:02.708 --> 09:04.252
I have a little
gift for you.

09:04.335 --> 09:06.045
This set of bar tools
has been passed down

09:06.128 --> 09:08.923
from account man to account man
since the dawn of history.

09:09.006 --> 09:10.841
1956.

09:10.925 --> 09:12.843
Can you be my dad?

09:12.927 --> 09:15.763
If your mom was a secretary,
there's a good chance I am.

09:15.846 --> 09:17.932
(tires squealing)

09:18.015 --> 09:19.100
(sighs)

09:19.183 --> 09:22.687
Welcome home, handsome!

09:22.770 --> 09:24.438
(both moan)

09:24.522 --> 09:25.982
(laughs)

09:26.065 --> 09:29.110
It's a rat race,
but it looks like I won.

09:29.193 --> 09:32.822
-Oh, to the victor go the spoils.
-Mmm.

09:32.905 --> 09:35.575
Dad, you were supposed
to read me a bedtime story.

09:35.658 --> 09:38.369
Oh, sorry, sweetie.
Bart can read it to you.

09:38.452 --> 09:39.787
(Homer and Marge laugh)

09:39.870 --> 09:42.456
Read to Lisa? Why don't you
just ask me to kiss her?

09:42.540 --> 09:44.709
If you kissed her,
that would be lovely.

09:44.792 --> 09:47.044
-I'll read! I'll read!
-And kiss.

09:47.128 --> 09:48.838
Does anyone want
my opinion?

09:48.921 --> 09:51.465
Please, Lisa.
I had 18 martinis today.

09:51.549 --> 09:53.092
MARGE:
Hello.

09:53.175 --> 09:57.430
All right, Lis, let's get this stupid
bedtime story over with.

09:57.513 --> 09:59.849
Proceed to the page with
the butterfly bookmark

09:59.932 --> 10:02.018
as I cuddle up
with Madam Bunny.

10:02.101 --> 10:03.477
(clears throat)

10:03.561 --> 10:07.440
"If genn-i-oos..."

10:07.523 --> 10:08.774
Genius.

10:08.858 --> 10:12.153
"...is eternal pati...

10:12.236 --> 10:13.821
pat-eh...

10:13.904 --> 10:14.905
pa-tie..."

10:14.989 --> 10:17.700
Patience. Patience!
Get on with it!

10:17.783 --> 10:20.244
Shut up! Shut up!
I'm a bad reader, okay?!

10:20.328 --> 10:23.581
-Well, I could help you.
-I don't want your help!

10:23.664 --> 10:26.334
I'll get one of those jobs
where you don't need to read,

10:26.417 --> 10:28.461
like French fry maker
or general.

10:28.544 --> 10:30.630
-Well, you're getting my help.
-Forget it.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.256
Don't you want to be able
to read the things

10:32.340 --> 10:34.467
people carve into your chest
in prison?

10:34.550 --> 10:35.801
I guess.

10:35.885 --> 10:37.887
♪♪

10:49.440 --> 10:51.317
Close enough.

10:59.533 --> 11:01.702
(sighs)

11:35.194 --> 11:37.029
"But when the helpful voice
was silent,

11:37.113 --> 11:39.740
the daily lesson over,
the beloved presence gone,

11:39.824 --> 11:41.951
and nothing remained
but loneliness and grief,

11:42.034 --> 11:44.954
then Jo found her promise
very hard to keep."

11:45.037 --> 11:46.872
We did it, Bart.

11:46.956 --> 11:49.125
-(groans)
-I'm a mentor.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.127
Big deal, you taught me
to read one book.

11:51.210 --> 11:54.213
No, Bart, you can read
other books, too.

11:54.296 --> 11:55.464
What?!

11:59.135 --> 12:02.054
Homie,
what are you doing?

12:02.138 --> 12:04.432
My work is
so meaningless.

12:04.515 --> 12:06.100
You make electricity.

12:06.183 --> 12:08.144
It runs the hospital.

12:08.227 --> 12:10.312
You can't touch
electricity, Marge,

12:10.396 --> 12:11.731
you can't feel it.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.899
That's because
it would kill you.

12:13.983 --> 12:16.193
It already is killing me,
Marge.

12:16.277 --> 12:17.862
You're the only one
I can talk to.

12:17.945 --> 12:20.072
My wife just
doesn't get it.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.574
I'm your wife.

12:21.657 --> 12:22.867
My job is my wife,

12:22.950 --> 12:26.996
loneliness-- my mistress,
despair-- my sex buddy.

12:27.079 --> 12:28.998
Angst is a chick
I met online,

12:29.081 --> 12:31.125
but then it turned out
it was really a guy.

12:31.208 --> 12:32.418
I'm going to bed.

12:32.501 --> 12:34.086
You don't understand me.

12:34.170 --> 12:36.255
Only she understands me.

12:37.673 --> 12:38.924
Another round, kid?

12:46.390 --> 12:47.933
(squeaks)

12:54.273 --> 12:58.402
Hey, uh...
I got here after you did.

13:03.324 --> 13:05.451
I'm sorry to bother you at home,
Mr. Marlowe,

13:05.534 --> 13:07.787
but my husband's
acting pretty odd--

13:07.870 --> 13:10.623
coming home late,
drinking in the morning.

13:10.706 --> 13:12.958
-Wake me when you get to "odd."
-Hmm.

13:13.042 --> 13:16.128
I don't suppose you'd consider
taking your old job back

13:16.212 --> 13:19.131
so Homie can go back
to his old job?

13:19.215 --> 13:20.800
Sorry, Marge,
that account job hollowed me out

13:20.883 --> 13:22.468
like a cheap chocolate bunny.

13:22.551 --> 13:25.137
I've been divorced three times,
I've got a cocktail addiction,

13:25.221 --> 13:26.806
a shrimp cocktail addiction,

13:26.889 --> 13:29.308
and I can't stop bending women
to my sexual will.

13:29.391 --> 13:33.646
Well, you certainly
won't be bending me...

13:33.729 --> 13:36.148
Wait, how did I end up
in your bedroom?

13:36.232 --> 13:39.235
Lady, I am smoother than
an Eisenhower-era freeway.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.654
Look, I came to talk
about my husband, and...

13:41.737 --> 13:43.739
How did we get in here?

13:43.823 --> 13:45.324
I think better
in the shower.

13:45.407 --> 13:46.659
There's room in here for two.

13:46.742 --> 13:49.245
I'm a happily married woman.

13:49.328 --> 13:51.831
Wow, no woman's ever done
that to me before.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.582
Your husband
is a lucky man.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.918
I know,
and I don't want him to stray

13:56.001 --> 13:58.254
from anything except his diet,

13:58.337 --> 14:01.257
and I don't really
want him to do that.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.259
Marge, I made
a big mistake years ago.

14:03.342 --> 14:04.844
I gave up on my family.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.096
Then I gave up on my
secret other family.

14:07.179 --> 14:09.723
I missed my son's graduation,
my father's funeral,

14:09.807 --> 14:11.350
and my dog's
best in show.

14:11.433 --> 14:13.894
Don't let Homer make
the mistakes I did.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.521
Luann?

14:15.604 --> 14:16.897
It's not what you think.

14:16.981 --> 14:19.692
It's much weirder.

14:21.610 --> 14:23.737
You're reading
a chapter book.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.322
For fun!

14:25.406 --> 14:27.825
Bullies, to me.

14:27.908 --> 14:29.243
(both grunt)

14:29.326 --> 14:31.579
Let's see the name
of this wedgie ticket.

14:31.662 --> 14:33.706
-(gulps)
<i>-Little Women?</i>

14:33.789 --> 14:36.667
Are you aware that's another way
of saying "girls"?

14:36.750 --> 14:38.419
Look, I had to read it
to my sister.

14:38.502 --> 14:40.588
Well, maybe
we should hear a little.

14:40.671 --> 14:43.549
And then maybe you'll be hearing
from my sisters.

14:43.632 --> 14:45.759
Your fists are sisters?

14:45.843 --> 14:48.929
Yeah, Poke-ahontas
and Sock-ajawea!

14:49.013 --> 14:51.140
-Nice save.
-Get reading.

14:52.850 --> 14:55.436
"And Amy and Jo hugged
one another close,

14:55.519 --> 14:59.064
and everything was forgotten
in one hearty kiss."

14:59.148 --> 15:01.025
End of chapter eight.

15:01.108 --> 15:02.192
You can't stop now.

15:02.276 --> 15:04.320
I want to know if their father
comes home.

15:04.403 --> 15:06.530
Does Jo learn to handle
her hasty temper?

15:06.614 --> 15:09.033
Does Amy get over
her conceitedness?

15:09.116 --> 15:11.785
Aw, come on, guys,
it's getting dark.

15:11.869 --> 15:15.497
Okay, but you better be here
tomorrow after school.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.583
'Cause we're going to
keep making you read us

15:17.666 --> 15:19.251
a lame ol' girl's book.

15:19.335 --> 15:21.337
(laughter)

15:21.420 --> 15:23.088
Bart needs to work
on differentiating

15:23.172 --> 15:25.424
the character voices
a little better.

15:25.507 --> 15:28.260
I know, I keep going,
"Why is Meg saying that?"

15:28.344 --> 15:30.387
and then I realize it's Beth.

15:30.471 --> 15:31.722
-(all agreeing)
-That's right.

15:31.805 --> 15:34.099
(Homer grunting)

15:34.183 --> 15:36.226
(intercom buzzes)

15:36.310 --> 15:38.020
<i>RECEPTIONIST:</i>
<i>Your wife is here, Mr. S.</i>

15:38.103 --> 15:41.148
(whispering loudly)
Tell her I'm at a meeting, not drinking.

15:41.231 --> 15:43.442
<i>This is a whisper-amplifying</i>
<i>intercom.</i>

15:43.525 --> 15:45.235
-(screams)
-Homer, I want you to come

15:45.319 --> 15:48.113
with me and the kids
on a family vacation.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.323
Of course, of course.

15:49.406 --> 15:51.951
Family is everything
to us company men.

15:53.160 --> 15:55.162
Now, where shall we go
on your vacation?

15:55.245 --> 15:58.248
The farthest thing from
this office I know:

15:58.332 --> 16:01.335
rafting down Rattler River Canyon.

16:02.252 --> 16:03.462
(Homer whimpers)

16:03.545 --> 16:05.047
That's great--
let me run the numbers

16:05.130 --> 16:06.924
'cause I really want
the Simpson account.

16:07.007 --> 16:09.468
And give these cigars
to your children.

16:09.551 --> 16:11.929
Don't talk to me
like I'm a client.

16:12.012 --> 16:14.890
You're not a client,
you're <i>the</i> client.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.642
(groans)

16:16.725 --> 16:20.062
Simpson, put on your
charm-their-pants-off pants.

16:20.145 --> 16:22.064
The mumpish oafs
in Washington are sending

16:22.147 --> 16:24.316
their sternest band
of nuclear regulators,

16:24.400 --> 16:26.443
handpicked to resist
all blandishment.

16:26.527 --> 16:28.445
I'll handle it, I always do.

16:28.529 --> 16:29.905
Rafting, eh?

16:29.989 --> 16:31.991
It's a perfect way
to entertain them.

16:32.074 --> 16:35.202
Finally, humanity has found
a use for water.

16:35.285 --> 16:38.622
Mr. Burns, I can't go
rafting with you because--

16:38.706 --> 16:41.000
wait a minute,
could this all work?

16:45.671 --> 16:47.589
<i>HOMER:</i>
<i>Oh, no, you don't.</i>

16:47.673 --> 16:49.008
Coggily-doggily.

16:49.091 --> 16:51.635
It all fits.
Mr. Burns, rafting it is.

16:51.719 --> 16:52.636
Excellent.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.138
But Mr. S.,

16:54.221 --> 16:56.598
you just promised this week
to Mrs. S., Master B.,

16:56.682 --> 16:58.142
and Mamselles L. and M.

16:58.225 --> 16:59.601
Now, relax, Dottie.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.770
Leave everything to me.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.480
(grunts)

17:07.609 --> 17:10.195
Oh, Marge, this is
the most romantic trip

17:10.279 --> 17:11.989
you ever nagged me into.

17:12.072 --> 17:14.116
And maybe
when we get home,

17:14.199 --> 17:16.785
we can ride down
something else.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.787
Not sure what you're
going for, but...

17:18.871 --> 17:20.205
(lusty growl)

17:21.373 --> 17:22.958
(gasps)

17:24.626 --> 17:26.795
Uh, Marge, why don't I
catch us some salmon?

17:26.879 --> 17:28.630
(grunting)

17:28.714 --> 17:29.965
D'oh!

17:30.049 --> 17:32.051
(grunting)

17:32.134 --> 17:33.594
It's about time.

17:33.677 --> 17:36.555
We've been making small talk
about Mussolini for 15 minutes.

17:36.638 --> 17:38.974
Well, I, uh, found
that contact lens I was missing.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.976
Let me just screw her back in.

17:41.060 --> 17:44.480
(pained grunting)

17:45.898 --> 17:47.691
So, everybody good?

17:47.775 --> 17:48.609
Why did you get us...

17:48.692 --> 17:51.487
<i>Diversity Kittens</i>
<i>on Meltingpot Mountain?</i>

17:51.570 --> 17:53.906
<i>It's more fun to play</i>
<i>with a ball of yarn</i>

17:53.989 --> 17:56.450
<i>if it has all the colors in it.</i>

17:56.533 --> 18:00.370
<i>And yarn should be allowed</i>
<i>to marry dental floss.</i>

18:06.293 --> 18:08.170
If you've got that, then...

18:09.755 --> 18:11.965
<i>Are you sure</i>
<i>you're Martin Scorsese?</i>

18:12.049 --> 18:12.925
(Homer grunts)

18:13.008 --> 18:15.427
Enjoy the outdoors,
you stupid kid.

18:15.511 --> 18:16.678
(worried grunting)

18:16.762 --> 18:18.055
This family time is so precious.

18:18.138 --> 18:19.765
Got to go.

18:19.848 --> 18:21.100
(panting)

18:21.183 --> 18:23.435
(murmurs suspiciously)

18:23.519 --> 18:24.812
(grunting)

18:24.895 --> 18:26.063
(unzips, hums)

18:26.146 --> 18:27.189
(zips up)

18:27.272 --> 18:28.690
(grunting)

18:28.774 --> 18:29.691
(grunts wearily)

18:29.775 --> 18:31.777
Homer, I want
a Long Island ice tea,

18:31.860 --> 18:33.862
America's most
complicated cocktail.

18:36.365 --> 18:37.741
Homer,

18:37.825 --> 18:41.078
are you schmoozing those men?

18:41.161 --> 18:42.579
(alarmed shriek)

18:42.663 --> 18:44.248
Huh?

18:44.331 --> 18:46.917
Um, I think we're supposed
to get off here.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.544
Take us out first.

18:48.627 --> 18:50.212
Anyone can start a family.

18:50.295 --> 18:52.339
These days
no one can find a job.

18:52.422 --> 18:54.842
Let's see, my family
gives me love and sex.

18:54.925 --> 18:56.677
My work gives me
money and sleep.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.929
Hurry, we're heading
for the falls!

19:00.889 --> 19:02.766
My coworkers are like a family,

19:02.850 --> 19:05.811
but in some ways
my family is like a family, too.

19:05.894 --> 19:09.398
For God's sakes, Homer,
I've given you three children.

19:09.481 --> 19:10.983
Whose side are you on?

19:11.066 --> 19:15.320
Yours, Homie,
I'm always on yours.

19:20.033 --> 19:21.451
How ironic.

19:21.535 --> 19:23.704
I survived the <i>Titanic</i>
by making a raft

19:23.787 --> 19:26.832
out of steerage passengers,
and now this.

19:26.915 --> 19:29.710
MARLOWE:
Mr. Burns, your heart will go on.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.505
(all screaming)

19:33.589 --> 19:35.799
Marlowe, I thought
you retired.

19:35.883 --> 19:39.011
I can't-- Treasury bills
are paying nothing. Nothing!

19:39.094 --> 19:40.637
Well, Simpson,
you were willing

19:40.721 --> 19:42.681
to let me go
over a waterfall,

19:42.764 --> 19:44.808
but you cut operating expenses
by six percent,

19:44.892 --> 19:46.935
-so you're forgiven.
-Thanks.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.478
Now if you'll
excuse me,

19:48.562 --> 19:51.273
I don't really like bourbon
or business talk,

19:51.356 --> 19:54.568
just good old
Simpson family fun.

19:54.651 --> 19:56.236
Hey, kids, I'm it.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.863
(laughter)

19:59.364 --> 20:01.450
(grunting)

20:01.533 --> 20:02.618
Aah!

20:02.701 --> 20:05.621
(screams)

20:07.706 --> 20:10.375
I'm okay,
and I found some gold!

20:10.459 --> 20:13.420
See, luckiest man
in the world.

20:14.504 --> 20:15.964
Oh, I'm so glad

20:16.048 --> 20:18.842
you're not an accounts man anymore.

20:18.926 --> 20:20.719
Yep, your worries
are over.

20:20.802 --> 20:23.305
I'm back to being
a boring old safety inspector

20:23.388 --> 20:25.390
at a nuclear power plant.

20:25.474 --> 20:28.727
(both moaning)

21:21.697 --> 21:23.740
-(murmuring)
-Shh!
