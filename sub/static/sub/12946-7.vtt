WEBVTT

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
ANNOUNCER: We now return to

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Gangstalicious: Resurrection.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
"Resurrection"?

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
The nigga ain't dead.
Shh.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
He was shot a bunch of times,
all right?

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
At least, he tryin'.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
By late last year, the ongoing feud

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
between Gangstalicious and his crew

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
from New West Manchester, Delaware...

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Yeah, nigga. What's hood?

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
...and Eat Dirt and his crew

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Boo! from Lickety-Split, Virginia,

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
had escalated to the brink of catastrophic warfare.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
"Catastrophic warfare"?

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
It's just some dumb niggas
beefin'.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
What you talkin' about, fool?
This is war.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
Yeah, the nigga version
of the Cuban Missile Crisis.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
RILEY:
Shh!

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
Tensions exploded at an awards show last year

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
when a chair...

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
was thrown at Eat Dirt.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
All I'm sayin' is,
you know, shit's real.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
You know what I'm sayin'?
Shit ain't just music, right?

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
This is some bona fide,
unimpeachable gangsta shit.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
You know what I'm saying?
It's some indubitable shit!

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
What he said, nyukka.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Yeah, man, you motherfuckin'
darn thing.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
God knows, son, man,
you'll pick on your foot.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Nigga, fuck.
What the fuck with them, nigga?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Come on.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Heh. Look here, man.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Lot of these niggas tryin'
to have what we didn't have,

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
but they ain't done
what we did done

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
to have what we done have.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Especially you, 'Licious.
You ain't done nothin'.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
ANNOUNCER: Then, later that year,

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
an altercation in a Miami nightclub

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
between Gangstalicious and Eat Dirt ended in violence.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
In the resulting struggle,

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
both rappers accidentally shot themselves.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Man, when I got shot,

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
I was, like, you know,
never again.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Ain't never gonna happen to me
again. Know what I'm sayin'?

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
What's up, world? I'm Sway.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
And this is
my inexplicable head wrap.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
We interrupt Gangstalicious: Resurrection

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
for this breaking news story.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Rapper Gangstalicious
has been shot.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
BOTH:
Again?

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Again.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
RILEY: I was so desperate for

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
information on the shootin',

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
I watched that show my brother calls "The News."

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
: Oh, shit!

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
Ah, nigga, I seent it. I seent the whole thing.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Nigga, you should've seent that shit I saw.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
Oh, great.
Black Eyewitness Man.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
I hate Black Eyewitness Man.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Nigga, shush. Shh! With my own eyes, nigga.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Damn that shit was crazy, nigga.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
Hold up. Nigga, that's me on TV, baby!

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Yeah, nigga! Yeah!

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
No, I ain't got your money, nigga.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
Jesus! It was terrible!

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
I was in the club and-- See, I was in the club,

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
and this bitch stepped on my shoe.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
And I was like, "Bitch!"

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
And then some nigga started shootin'.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
I was like, "There he go!"

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
He done fucked it up for everybody.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
RILEY: So, what had happened was

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
Gangstalicious was doing a show in town

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
when three men rushed the stage and shot him.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Ironically, he was doing his new joint,

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
"I Got Shot," at the time.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
ALL:

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
I got shot!

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
ALL:
I got shot!

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
No, I got shot for real!

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
ALL:
I got shot for real!

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
No, goddamn it, I got shot!
Niggas shot me!

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
I'm bleeding, I'm gonna die!

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Somebody, please, help me.
Help me!

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Help me!
I got shot!

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
Goddamn it, I got shot!
Niggas shot me!

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
RILEY: It was 45 minutes before

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
anyone called an ambulance.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Gangstalicious got shot!

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
Again?
We got to do something.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
I got an idea.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Let's go to college,

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
so we don't end up
like Gangstalicious.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
That boy got shot again?
That's a shame.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
A shame?

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
Granddad, a nigga stepping
on your sneakers is a shame.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
This is a catastrophe.
It's catastrophic.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Can I go to the hospital
and visit Gangstalicious?

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Boy, are you stupid?

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
Mm. I don't think so.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Look,

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
Gangstalicious needs his
street soldiers to protect him.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
The hospital's
only 15 minutes away.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
I said no.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
It is a shame.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
It's a damn shame?

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
RILEY: My family didn't understand

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
about being a street soldier.

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
Gangstalicious needed my help. I had to get to that hospital.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
Oh, no. I'm falling
down the steps.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Okay.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
My shoe!
Ah! Uh!

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Ow! Ooh.

06:15.000 --> 06:20.000
I fell down the steps.
I gotta go to the hospital.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
You ain't going
to that hospital.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
No, really.
I can't get up.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Where's the love?

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Ooh!
Huh?

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Oh, no! I got hit by a car.
What the hell?

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
GRANDDAD: You ain't going.
I gotta go the emergency room.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Trying to pull
that bull jive on me.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Come on, get up.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Come on.
Come on.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Where is your glass, boy?

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Glass?
I don't need no glass.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
I takes mine to the head.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Oh.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Ah.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
A full day's supply
of vitamin C.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Ow!

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Boy, have you lost your mind?

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
How are you gonna drink
my juice out of the carton?

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
I don't know where
your nasty lips have been.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
I know one thing.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
I ain't goin'
to the store to get no more.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
RILEY: See, I was like all

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
in the granddad's mental mind.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
It was like psychology, but in reverse.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
GRANDDAD:
The store and back,

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
that's it.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
No hospital.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Take my phone,
so I can reach you.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
But don't call anyone.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Damn, Granddad,
is that a cell phone

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
or a cordless payphone?

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Shut up.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
This thing looks like a laptop.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Stay away from that hospital!

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
RILEY: I headed straight

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
for the hospital.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Nearly a week had passed since the shooting,

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
and things seemed like they was back to normal.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Excuse me, I'm lookin'
for Gangstalicious.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
And who are you?

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
I'm one of his many
illegitimate children.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Fifth floor.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Gangstalicious?

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
Hey, what's up, little man?
Who are you?

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Hey. Uh...

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
My name's Riley,
and, uh, I'm one of your fans.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
That was close. Come on in.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Hey, I live around here,

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
and I just wanted
to let you know that,

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
you know,
it wasn't nobody in my crew

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
that did the shooting.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
Yeah, yeah.
I appreciate that, little man.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Does it hurt?

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
What? This?

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Naw, naw-- Oh!

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
Naw, naw, naw. Hey, I'm fine.
I'm chillin', man.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Hey, man, you wanna hang out
for a little bit?

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Get that chair over there
real quick. Yeah.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Don't worry about it.
I ain't Michael Jackson.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Ho, ho. You said
"Michael Jackson," man.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
That's funny,
Gangstalicious.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
So who you think it was
that tried to assassinate you?

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Was it Eat Dirt?

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Naw, naw,
it wasn't Eat Dirt.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
It was these dudes
I used to owe money to

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
back when I was
in the drug game.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
Wow, that's so real.
The drug game.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
Word. That's real spit.
Dunny-dun-dun-dun.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
That's why I tell kids
like you,

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
the drug game is cool,
you know,

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
but in some ways,
it's not cool. But--

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
But mostly it's cool.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
Well, I know getting shot
must be cool.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
You think
they gonna come back?

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Hell to the nizz-naw.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
After I got shot,
I was like,

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
God is watchin' over me,
you know?

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
It's like that nigga
from  Pulp Fiction  said.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
"God got involved."

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
God is gangsta, nigga.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
See, anybody wanna come get me,
they gotta go through God.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
I don't fear no man but God.
You know what I'm saying?

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Beside, ain't nobody
gonna come up here to get us.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Cops everywhere.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
I didn't see no cops.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
Hm? There--

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
There ain't no cops out there?
No.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
Not even hospital security
or nothing? Nothing?

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Not that I saw.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
You sure?

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
They said they was gonna
stay till I was, you know--

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Till I left. I mean,
not that I want them there

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
'cause I don't,
know what I'm sayin'?

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
I'd probably shoot 'em
or something if they was there.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
But they just
supposed to be there, so...

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
I wish they-- Are they there?
Could you check?

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
I'll check again.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Yeah, yeah, you do that.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
We're lookin'
for Gangstalicious.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
We're well-wishers.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
What's the big deal about,

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
what's his name,
Bubblicious?

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
It's Gangstalicious.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Dumb niggas
love Gangstalicious

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
the way fat women
love Oprah, Granddad.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
What the hell is "Thugin' Luv"?
Who would want "Thugin' Luv"?

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Is that when you make love
to your woman,

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
then right before
that special moment,

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
you beat her upside the head,

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
snatch her purse,
and throw her down the stairs?

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Where the hell
is that boy?

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Ooh!

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Gah! What?

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
GRANDDAD: Where's my goddamn

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
orange juice, boy?

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
You hear me? What you doin', growin' the oranges?

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Uh, the bike got a flat,
Granddad.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
But everything's cool.
I'm walkin' to the store.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
My God,
that's a big phone.

11:57.000 --> 12:02.000
I am a collector of incredibly
large antique electronics.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Can I buy that from you?
Go away!

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
PATIENT:
It's so big!

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
I'll give you
50 bucks for it.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Get the beans anyway.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
And bring me a can of that spray.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
Okay, okay, 70.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Hey. Hey, homey.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
Gotta have my eggs with my OJ.
Uh. Uh, uh...

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
Yo. Hold up, little man.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
All right, all right. Bye.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
One hundred ten dollars.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
It's enormous!

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Move, cancer boy!

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Let me through!

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
Close, close, close.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Damn.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Third floor.
Let's move.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Come on.
Come on, man.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
I'm telling you, Bernie,
the police left.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Well, the label should be
providin' the security!

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
This is bullshit!

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
No, no, no.
This is unacceptable.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
I just got
my black ass shot here,

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
and all you got for me is--?

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
Hello? Hello? Bernie?

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
Niggas...coming.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Come on, man, this way.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
RUCKUS:

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
With slavery

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
Back then

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Be your fr--

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Uh-- Oh.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Where's Gangstalicious?

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Uh, say that again.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
I couldn't hear you over
the sound of me shittin' myself.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
ANNOUNCER: We now return to

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
Gangstalicious: Resurrection.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
The judge allowed Gangstalicious' music

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
to be introduced as evidence at his assault trial.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
They played for the jury, a track called,

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
"Play It for the Jury."

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
I keep telling these people.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
This shit is supposed
to be just music.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
You know what I'm sayin'?

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
I mean, you really
think about it, is it worth it?

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Know what I'm sayin'?

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
I mean, somebody could get hurt.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
That boy don't look
that tough to me.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
Man, Riley should
be seeing this.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Damn, nigga.
You short.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
Y-you don't understand.
I know this guy. He is crazy.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
He, like, uh, got a chemical
imbalance or something.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
I'm just sayin', man.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
You look much taller
in the videos.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Do you hear
what I am saying to you?!

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
That nigga's a rageaholic!
We're both gonna die!

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
Well, w-what happened to,
"I don't fear no man but God"?

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
Correction:
God and the nigga that shot me.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Oh, Lord,
what is we gonna do?

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
Man, just get yourself together.
You makin' me scared.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
Hey, hey, hey,
I'm trippin', man.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
They got a nigga medicated
and shit.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
It's the painkillers
and, you know...

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
...Sucrets and shit.
I'm cool, I'm cool.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
RUCKUS:
There they are!

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
Right over there.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
Thanks.
Now, go change your pants.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
We're gonna die!

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Run, nigga!

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Oh, Lord. Sweet Jesus.
I'm gonna die!

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Where's your gun?

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Y'all niggas
is in for it now.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Oh! Oh! Oh!

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
We need a car.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
We're gonna have to
jack someone.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
Where's your gun?

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
I dropped the gun.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
You dropped the gun?

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
What's done is done.
Let's be solution-oriented.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
You mad?

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
How you go and drop the gun,
Gangstalicious?

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
That is not gangsta.
That's very not gangsta!

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
Man, I can't believe this.
You a fraud!

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Oh, oh, I'm a fraud?
You're scared too.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
I'm 8!

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Okay, fine, fine,
whatever.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
I'm a fraud,
I'm a fraud.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
I'm just
an average, normal dude.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
I don't wanna do this
stupid shit no more.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
I'm tired
of gettin' shot. Help.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
It's like goin' to heaven
and finding God smokin' crack.

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
MAN:
Holy shit!

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
I can't believe it's you.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Dude, you are the shit.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
"Thugin' Luv"? What?

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
So, uh,
I'll just wait here then?

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
GANGSTALICIOUS:
Where we gonna go?

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
RILEY:
To the airport.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
You got your jet there, right?

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
What jet?
The G4.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
The one in
the "Bitch, I'm Fly" video.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
We rented that jet.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
Oh, unbelievable, man!
You broke too?

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
RILEY:
Ah! Man, I wanna go home!

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
Man, I should've
listened to my Granddad.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
You gonna get us killed!

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Put your seat belt on.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
It's the law,
and it's a good idea.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Man, just go faster.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Traffic!

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
RILEY:
Whoa!

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Ow!

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
I told you put
your seat belt on,

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
but no, little niggas
gotta do their thing.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
I got this nigga now.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Slow down, nigga!

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
Yo, yo, yo!

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
What's up now, niggas?
Open the door.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Mm-mm.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
Open--
Hey, open the door.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Nigga, if you don't
open this door...

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Mm-mm.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
I told you this nigga was crazy.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Know who my favorite rapper was
when I was your age?

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Ice Cube.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
The dude
that makes family movies?

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
He was a gangsta rapper?

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
He was so gangsta,
I used have to have dreams

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
that Ice Cube came to my house
and killed my whole family.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
And for some reason,
I thought he was so cool,

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
and I wanted to be him.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
When I started to act like that,
like a killer,

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
people liked me.
Girls, you know, whatever.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
But I really wasn't that person,

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
and finally,
it caught up with me.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
I'm sorry
you got caught in the middle.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.000
Please, Lincoln, you are taking
this shit too far.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
This tape is itchy.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Should've thought of that

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
before you did
what you did, Frederick.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Look, guys, don't kill him.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Whatever he did,

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
he ain't do nothin'
to deserve this, man.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
This is about things

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
you're too young
to understand, little man.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
This is about...

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
thugin' luv.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
I loved you, man.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
RILEY:
What?

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
You broke my heart, man.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
RILEY:
What? What the--?

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
Oh! Ugh!

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
Oh, man, these niggas
are still kissin'.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Yeah. Mmm.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
RILEY:
Oh, they bustin' slob.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Oh, man!

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
I can't take it.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
I was on tour.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
You gotta understand,
I was lonely!

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Oh, God.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Turn around, nigga!

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Walk forward, nigga.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
LINCOLN:
We could've had

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
a life together, man.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
Huh? Hm?

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
Shit, we missed.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
I can't believe this, man.
We suck.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
LINCOLN:
Hey, get back here!

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
¡Aye, maricón!

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
LINCOLN:
Come on, man.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
Do you see him?

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
MANOLO:
I can't see anything, man.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
LINCOLN:
Yo! Where you at?

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
Come out from where you at.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
GRANDDAD:
I can't believe that damn boy.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
RILEY:
And then they threw us

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
in the trunk, and--

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
And then they was about
to execute Gangstalicious.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
GRANDDAD:
...and don't come back

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
with no orange juice...

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
And that's
when one of them dudes

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
knocked me upside
my head, right?

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
And I was havin',
like, crazy dreams,

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
like Gangstalicious
was kissin' the other dude.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Some old craziness, man.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Anyway, when I came to,

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
they was gone,
and I came home.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
GRANDDAD:
What are these kids

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
doin' today?

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
And you really shot one of them
dudes at the hospital?

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Oh, hell yeah.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
See, Gangstalicious
dropped his gun, right?

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
And I picked it up,
and I was like:

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Ka-plow! Ka-plow!

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
It was like
some old John Woo shit.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
GRANDDAD:
Let me take my medication.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
RILEY:
Then Gangstalicious

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
started cryin' and shit,

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
and I'm like,
"Quit cryin', you little bitch!"

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
You should've seen me.
I was so gangsta!

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
GRANDDAD:
What the heck is goin'

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
on around here?
