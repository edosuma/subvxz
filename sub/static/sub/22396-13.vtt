00:03.666 --> 00:05.582
Big date with minnie tonight, pal.

00:06.499 --> 00:08.582
What to wear, what to wear,
what to wear... hmm.

00:08.582 --> 00:10.166
Red pants. Red pants. Red pants.

00:10.166 --> 00:11.832
No, how about this?

00:12.333 --> 00:14.457
It's that couples sweater that
minnie makes us both wear.

00:14.457 --> 00:16.083
Ah!
I can't wear that!

00:16.083 --> 00:18.041
It itches like crazy!

00:18.041 --> 00:20.749
Well, there's no way she's
going to wear hers, right?

00:21.124 --> 00:22.124
Yoo-hoo,

00:23.124 --> 00:24.374
Mickey!

00:28.208 --> 00:30.041
Can I get y'all started on some drinks?

00:30.457 --> 00:33.124
Water. Anything you
want, couples sweaters.

00:33.124 --> 00:35.124
Isn't it marvelous here?

00:35.124 --> 00:36.624
Huh? What?
Yeah. It's great.

00:36.874 --> 00:39.124
Uh, so.
How was your week?

00:39.124 --> 00:40.374
Well, let's see.

00:40.374 --> 00:43.208
Uh, Monday, I woke up
and then I put on my shoes.

00:43.208 --> 00:45.208
Oh, gosh. Can't concentrate.
And then, I went to the...

00:45.208 --> 00:46.291
The sweater.
The itching!

00:46.291 --> 00:47.333
Eyes watering.

00:47.874 --> 00:48.915
Lips chapped.

00:49.291 --> 00:50.832
I wanna pull my hands off.

00:51.083 --> 00:53.166
Can't turn head.

00:53.624 --> 00:55.333
That spot on my back!

00:55.333 --> 00:57.499
I gotta get out of here
fast... Oh, yay, dinner!

00:58.083 --> 00:59.124
Tada!

01:02.291 --> 01:03.208
Hey, minnie, you done yet?

01:03.208 --> 01:05.749
Oh, I don't think I'll ever be done.

01:06.582 --> 01:08.333
Okay, you're done.

01:08.582 --> 01:09.957
Let's go home!

01:10.208 --> 01:12.208
Oh, let's go dancing!

01:12.208 --> 01:13.374
What?

01:43.582 --> 01:45.624
Sweater... off... now!

01:45.624 --> 01:49.124
Yoo-hoo, Mickey!

01:50.208 --> 01:51.249
Wha...

01:52.416 --> 01:54.166
Minnie's so happy.

01:54.915 --> 01:56.582
Guess the sweater is staying on.

01:58.374 --> 01:59.208
Itch!

02:02.416 --> 02:04.249
Isn't this just fantastic?

02:04.541 --> 02:06.374
Itch sure is...

02:26.457 --> 02:27.582
Oh, that was delightful.

02:28.541 --> 02:29.624
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

02:30.707 --> 02:33.124
No more sweaters!

02:33.124 --> 02:34.333
I'm going home!

02:34.666 --> 02:35.957
Oh, couples sweaters!

02:35.957 --> 02:37.416
I need a picture!

02:38.041 --> 02:42.541
Uh, just have to attach the flash cube...

02:44.083 --> 02:45.208
No!

02:45.208 --> 02:46.790
No with all my heart!

02:49.249 --> 02:51.333
Oh no, where's the sweater going? Oh no!

02:54.124 --> 02:55.707
What happened? What
happened to the sweater?

02:55.707 --> 02:57.333
Minnie. Minnie,
I'm so sorry.

02:57.915 --> 03:00.124
I know that sweater meant so much to you.

03:00.124 --> 03:02.249
But I can't live with the lie any longer.

03:02.249 --> 03:05.041
Minnie, the truth is
I hated that sweater.

03:05.041 --> 03:06.166
I really hated it.

03:06.166 --> 03:09.457
The claustrophobia, ugh, the chafing!

03:09.457 --> 03:10.624
The infections!

03:12.124 --> 03:14.166
Oh, Mickey, it's really okay.

03:14.166 --> 03:15.790
I hate these sweaters too.

03:16.416 --> 03:19.457
What?
Yes. They're just so itchy.

03:19.457 --> 03:21.832
Let's never wear couples sweaters again.

03:23.957 --> 03:25.041
Deal!

03:25.041 --> 03:26.208
Oh yeah, right there.

03:26.208 --> 03:27.416
Your turn!
Scratchy scratchy...

03:27.416 --> 03:28.749
Itchy scratchy, scratchy itchy.
