<i>Previously on "The Mist"...</i>

00:02.141 --> 00:04.241
This is not the first time
nature's come alive."...

00:04.310 --> 00:06.877
She's worshipping a false god
in your church.

00:06.946 --> 00:08.879
The rebar is in your brother's liver.

00:08.948 --> 00:10.280
I'm not killing you. Are you insane?

00:12.369 --> 00:14.184
I'm so sorry.

00:19.525 --> 00:21.692
It came. It looked at me, and it left.

00:21.760 --> 00:23.694
I don't want to be
with those people anymore.

00:25.230 --> 00:27.331
What the hell
you do that for, faggot, huh?

00:28.701 --> 00:31.101
- Who are you?
- I thought this was Bryan Hunt's room.

00:31.170 --> 00:32.402
I'm Bryan Hunt.

00:32.470 --> 00:34.705
- Do you know who did this to you?
- Jonah Dixon.

00:34.773 --> 00:36.373
Don't get attached to anyone.

00:36.442 --> 00:37.975
They'll just use you for their own good.

00:40.498 --> 00:41.511
Mia?

00:59.653 --> 01:01.319
What are you doing here?

01:03.963 --> 01:05.028
Who are you?

01:10.856 --> 01:12.589
I'm your friend.

01:12.745 --> 01:14.044
You don't remember?

01:16.261 --> 01:17.294
You know who I am?

01:17.449 --> 01:19.082
Of course I do.

01:20.652 --> 01:21.852
Is everything okay, man?

01:59.191 --> 02:00.757
Tell me who I am.

02:02.414 --> 02:04.156
Tell me who I am!

02:04.630 --> 02:07.964
- They will... find you.
- Who?

02:14.397 --> 02:16.063
All right.

02:29.288 --> 02:30.320
Kevin.

02:32.391 --> 02:34.091
Where's your brother at?

02:45.704 --> 02:47.637
How did it happen?

02:47.706 --> 02:49.473
Does it matter?

02:49.541 --> 02:52.176
- It could be important.
- He's just dead.

02:54.279 --> 02:56.113
That's all you need to know.

02:56.181 --> 02:57.681
Dr. Bailey.

03:00.686 --> 03:01.852
Excuse me.

03:03.422 --> 03:05.123
We've lost another patient,

03:05.193 --> 03:06.584
this woman over here.

03:06.623 --> 03:08.947
She came to look for her husband in 227.

03:09.007 --> 03:10.874
You were the last to see her.

03:12.064 --> 03:15.298
Yeah, you stay. I'll go.

03:19.286 --> 03:20.876
What's going on?

03:20.915 --> 03:23.064
Oh, it's nothing for you
to be worried about.

03:23.159 --> 03:25.459
You kind of suck at lying.

03:25.528 --> 03:28.629
It's fine. Everything is fine.
We've got it all under control.

03:31.167 --> 03:33.634
I just want to know if there's
something I should look out for.

03:33.702 --> 03:35.020
There's nothing to look out for.

03:35.067 --> 03:37.285
It's just we've...
we've had a few patients...

03:37.596 --> 03:39.029
disappear.

03:39.371 --> 03:41.975
Disappear?
Like, from inside the hospital?

03:42.044 --> 03:44.971
Yes, but it's possible
they left on their own accord.

03:45.133 --> 03:46.699
We're severely understaffed right now,

03:46.792 --> 03:48.625
and it's really hard to keep track.

03:53.689 --> 03:54.655
We're leaving.

03:54.723 --> 03:56.371
What? Now? We can't go.

03:56.426 --> 03:57.591
Bryan is still really messed up.

03:57.660 --> 04:00.094
He's got Mia. He'll be okay.

04:01.714 --> 04:03.548
Okay. There's something
I gotta do first.

04:03.573 --> 04:04.538
Okay.

04:08.437 --> 04:10.431
I could have done something.

04:10.906 --> 04:12.806
I could have held her and protected her.

04:12.875 --> 04:15.008
There's nothing you could have done.

04:15.552 --> 04:17.488
That thing in the bookstore,

04:18.047 --> 04:20.848
it took her and didn't want me. Why?

04:21.250 --> 04:23.117
Why did it want her and not me?

04:23.926 --> 04:25.385
Alex.

04:25.454 --> 04:27.879
It's because there's something
wrong with me, isn't it?

04:30.126 --> 04:31.625
Come on.

04:31.694 --> 04:32.860
Let's go.

04:32.928 --> 04:34.128
Where?

04:34.524 --> 04:35.891
Field trip.

04:50.249 --> 04:53.046
I remember how much Liza
liked coming here...

04:56.218 --> 04:57.217
and Jay.

05:01.056 --> 05:05.333
But I think he was here more for
the doughnuts than my sermons.

05:06.326 --> 05:08.412
What's on your mind, Father?

05:09.209 --> 05:11.365
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

05:16.505 --> 05:20.007
I remember, like it was yesterday...

05:22.134 --> 05:25.601
when you asked me to be there
with you and Liza.

05:26.281 --> 05:30.083
I was so honored you wanted me
there for her final hours.

05:31.942 --> 05:34.876
I'm glad I was there for you
after she passed,

05:34.946 --> 05:36.075
for you and Jay.

05:37.515 --> 05:39.082
We appreciated it.

05:40.785 --> 05:43.386
Liza was loyal to God till the very end.

05:44.320 --> 05:46.296
She knew she was dying,

05:46.488 --> 05:48.476
yet she didn't hate Him.

05:49.191 --> 05:52.459
She loved Him
for the life He had given her.

05:57.066 --> 06:00.767
Please don't let her down
by listening to Nathalie.

06:06.141 --> 06:07.975
Father, you're needed.

06:22.558 --> 06:24.825
She's talking
about the Black Spring again,

06:24.893 --> 06:26.426
and they are listening.

06:37.606 --> 06:38.839
Father.

07:44.673 --> 07:46.573
- Hi.
- Hey.

07:49.244 --> 07:50.210
We're leaving.

07:56.852 --> 07:58.285
It was interesting,

07:58.407 --> 08:01.115
you know, what we did.

08:01.256 --> 08:03.857
What, me beating the shit out of you?

08:03.926 --> 08:05.392
Yeah, that was interesting.

08:11.533 --> 08:13.100
See you around, I guess.

08:14.470 --> 08:15.702
Yeah, see ya.

08:34.456 --> 08:37.057
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

08:38.327 --> 08:39.558
Where's the car?

08:40.621 --> 08:41.953
Adrian?

08:42.508 --> 08:44.630
- I gave you the keys, Adrian!
- I don't have them!

08:44.693 --> 08:46.967
I... I swear I had them
near me when I... I...

08:47.035 --> 08:48.435
- Where are they?!
- Mia!

08:48.504 --> 08:49.736
Mia must have taken 'em.

08:55.310 --> 08:56.910
- The Jeep's gone.
- Gone where?

08:56.979 --> 08:59.152
Mia took it! Did you know?

08:59.381 --> 09:00.947
No, she didn't say shit to me.

09:03.318 --> 09:04.785
Why the hell did I trust her?

09:06.622 --> 09:07.821
Where are you going?

09:07.890 --> 09:09.322
- I need to find another working car.
- I'll come.

09:09.391 --> 09:11.550
No! Just...

09:11.927 --> 09:13.960
Just... I'll be back.

09:14.029 --> 09:15.295
Just stay here.

10:14.720 --> 10:16.587
Come on! Show me.

10:16.655 --> 10:17.788
One sec!

10:19.658 --> 10:22.259
Did you already try the purple one?

10:22.328 --> 10:24.294
I don't do purple!

10:39.778 --> 10:41.959
I hate the jacket.

10:42.116 --> 10:43.146
I love it.

10:52.209 --> 10:53.924
If the thing in the mist
doesn't want me,

10:53.993 --> 10:55.125
I could go find help.

10:55.154 --> 10:57.261
- No.
- I could find Dad.

10:57.329 --> 10:58.495
Alex.

10:58.564 --> 11:00.610
I just miss him.

11:00.933 --> 11:02.332
I know.

12:43.268 --> 12:45.435
You came to talk with the crazy lady.

12:46.672 --> 12:48.321
Well...

12:48.853 --> 12:51.475
I don't have enough crazy
in my life right now, so...

12:56.524 --> 12:57.614
What's wrong?

12:57.683 --> 12:59.266
Mm...

12:59.852 --> 13:03.672
I'm just thinking about
how it's changed everything.

13:04.690 --> 13:06.890
Well, I thought you said
all this was beautiful.

13:06.959 --> 13:08.458
Oh, it is.

13:09.995 --> 13:13.975
So is a volcanic eruption or a tsunami.

13:14.833 --> 13:18.035
Few things are more beautiful
than destruction,

13:18.103 --> 13:20.203
but doesn't mean I enjoy it.

13:21.473 --> 13:24.024
So this mist,

13:24.443 --> 13:26.143
you hope it'll disappear again?

13:26.211 --> 13:28.084
Yes, of course.

13:28.480 --> 13:29.813
And it will...

13:31.116 --> 13:32.816
once it has what it came for.

13:34.019 --> 13:35.819
What do you think it came for?

13:37.790 --> 13:40.390
A forest ranger I knew years ago

13:40.459 --> 13:42.526
told me about a mother brown bear

13:42.594 --> 13:44.786
who gave birth to three cubs.

13:45.698 --> 13:48.632
The rangers stayed nearby
to keep an eye on them

13:48.701 --> 13:51.336
and make sure the cubs
were safe from other predators,

13:51.870 --> 13:53.773
but they were shocked

13:54.173 --> 13:56.836
when the mother killed
the first two cubs.

13:57.376 --> 14:00.744
They intervened
and took the last baby, a male.

14:00.813 --> 14:02.145
Why did it do that?

14:02.214 --> 14:04.481
Well, while they
were caring for the cub,

14:04.550 --> 14:05.849
they discovered that it was suffering

14:05.918 --> 14:07.284
from fever and infection.

14:07.352 --> 14:08.985
It was sick when it was born.

14:09.054 --> 14:11.154
They thought
the mother killed the others

14:11.223 --> 14:12.744
because they were diseased, too.

14:12.814 --> 14:16.093
She killed them so they
couldn't spread the sickness

14:16.161 --> 14:17.994
and life could continue on.

14:22.301 --> 14:24.424
We're the infection, aren't we?

14:24.464 --> 14:26.698
Mm. Not all of us.

14:26.939 --> 14:28.772
Humans are nature, too.

14:31.076 --> 14:32.876
Something's wrong.

14:34.675 --> 14:36.842
I promise I'll tell you when I know.

14:39.852 --> 14:41.551
Thanks, crazy lady.

14:50.763 --> 14:53.005
It worked for a second.

14:53.398 --> 14:54.683
What?

14:55.300 --> 14:57.200
The distraction.

15:00.272 --> 15:02.472
I still hate that jacket.

15:09.300 --> 15:11.600
Maybe we can distract
the others as well.

15:12.718 --> 15:14.484
Come on. I have an idea.

15:14.553 --> 15:17.148
I think I'm gonna head back
to the loading dock,

15:17.273 --> 15:18.989
show off my new clothes.

15:20.759 --> 15:22.453
I'm gonna throw out
that jacket when I get back.

15:22.515 --> 15:23.919
No, you're not.

15:33.205 --> 15:34.437
I love you.

15:35.641 --> 15:36.907
I love you, too.

15:44.616 --> 15:46.211
Hey.

15:46.585 --> 15:49.085
Straight back, okay?

16:29.661 --> 16:31.493
Dr. Bailey.

16:33.866 --> 16:35.165
Don't just stand there!

16:35.234 --> 16:36.890
Help me with her!

16:36.915 --> 16:38.935
- What's going on?
- I just found her like this.

16:39.004 --> 16:40.403
I'm gonna need to sedate her.

16:40.472 --> 16:42.005
It's all right, Gwen. It's all right.

16:42.074 --> 16:44.641
- What the hell is all this?
- You have no idea.

17:07.933 --> 17:09.833
No!

17:09.902 --> 17:11.935
No!

17:19.579 --> 17:21.278
Generator's running dry.

17:23.648 --> 17:24.882
Don't worry.

17:24.951 --> 17:26.550
Kevin's coming back.

17:26.618 --> 17:28.319
He's been gone over an hour.

17:28.387 --> 17:29.620
I'm sure he's fine.

17:30.823 --> 17:33.190
People are disappearing.

17:33.259 --> 17:35.659
Nurse Shriver said three people
have disappeared

17:35.728 --> 17:37.127
in the past couple days.

17:38.531 --> 17:41.098
What do I do if he doesn't come back?

17:43.603 --> 17:45.836
All right.

17:50.409 --> 17:52.309
Let's go find him.

18:19.472 --> 18:20.471
I'm sorry...

18:22.141 --> 18:24.775
but it's been days now.
So many people have died,

18:24.844 --> 18:26.176
and so many more will,

18:26.245 --> 18:29.113
unless someone
can find a way to stop it.

18:29.181 --> 18:32.516
I'm trying, but I can't find
a solution without...

18:34.320 --> 18:35.586
experiments.

18:35.655 --> 18:37.154
I'm not a psycho.

18:37.223 --> 18:38.622
I'm really not.

18:38.691 --> 18:40.524
The woman you found,
she was already dying.

18:40.593 --> 18:42.426
So were the other people.

18:42.495 --> 18:44.828
And I never would've done
anything to you if you hadn't...

18:50.169 --> 18:52.703
We have to act now.

18:52.772 --> 18:54.271
Whatever it is out there...

18:55.408 --> 18:56.941
it's changing its behavior.

18:58.744 --> 19:00.377
It's getting smarter.

19:04.183 --> 19:05.449
Father.

19:13.626 --> 19:15.459
It's only getting worse.

19:17.597 --> 19:20.564
You should be out there
trying to save them.

19:22.602 --> 19:24.134
I should.

19:25.304 --> 19:26.870
I just don't know how.

19:26.939 --> 19:31.375
Maybe we can ask her
to just stop talking.

19:31.444 --> 19:35.312
I don't think that would help.

19:36.716 --> 19:39.917
You can be very persuasive, Father.

19:39.986 --> 19:43.087
The church has persuaded people
in the past.

19:44.457 --> 19:46.757
Those were horrible things to do.

19:46.826 --> 19:50.427
I know, but if they had a purpose...

19:52.365 --> 19:56.166
if they helped save
other people's souls...

19:58.437 --> 20:00.270
You said it yourself.

20:00.339 --> 20:03.374
The day of judgment is here.

20:03.442 --> 20:07.044
Nathalie's soul may be lost,
but we can save the others.

20:07.113 --> 20:08.166
You can!

20:08.224 --> 20:11.124
I cannot do what you ask of me.

20:11.350 --> 20:13.080
I can.

20:13.452 --> 20:15.219
The Lord will forgive me.

20:15.287 --> 20:17.621
He will see that I mean well.

20:20.359 --> 20:23.527
Don't give me your permission.

20:26.165 --> 20:27.965
It's better that way.

21:27.426 --> 21:28.859
Okay.

22:32.691 --> 22:34.892
Hello? Hello!

22:34.960 --> 22:37.494
Is anyone out there?!

22:46.772 --> 22:48.238
Aah!

22:50.643 --> 22:52.342
Somebody help me!

22:52.411 --> 22:54.077
Help! Help!

23:07.960 --> 23:09.426
What's going on?

23:11.997 --> 23:14.264
I could ask you the same thing.

23:18.971 --> 23:21.905
Everything has to be a pissing
contest with you, doesn't it?

23:21.974 --> 23:24.041
People call you bitch long enough,

23:24.109 --> 23:26.376
one day, you decide to act accordingly.

23:33.552 --> 23:35.485
How did we get here, Eve?

23:47.333 --> 23:48.632
What is this?

23:49.223 --> 23:51.001
It's hope.

23:53.395 --> 23:56.809
_

24:02.314 --> 24:03.647
Need some help?

24:06.352 --> 24:07.918
Help! Please!

24:09.255 --> 24:11.073
Alex!

24:11.257 --> 24:12.729
Alex, is that you?

24:12.845 --> 24:14.791
Please help! Please!

24:14.827 --> 24:16.093
I'm coming!

24:18.030 --> 24:19.043
Help!

24:22.101 --> 24:23.634
Jay, please hurry!

24:35.328 --> 24:36.717
Jay, hurry!

24:36.742 --> 24:38.048
Be careful!

24:47.059 --> 24:48.525
Jay!

25:00.272 --> 25:01.305
Are you okay?

25:01.373 --> 25:02.406
Yeah. Are you all right?

25:10.749 --> 25:12.049
Are you all right?

25:13.319 --> 25:15.152
How did you know I was in there?

25:16.755 --> 25:18.475
Did you do this?

25:18.746 --> 25:21.225
Did you lock me in there
so you could play hero?

25:21.327 --> 25:23.060
What?! I heard someone screaming.

25:23.128 --> 25:25.061
I didn't even know it was you!

25:25.297 --> 25:26.463
Then who was it?

25:26.634 --> 25:28.579
How should I know?

25:30.202 --> 25:32.436
You really think
I could have done this?!

25:33.370 --> 25:35.126
You know what?

25:35.413 --> 25:37.013
Fuck you, okay?!

25:37.090 --> 25:39.469
I do everything I can
to be nice to you, to help.

25:39.554 --> 25:41.212
I just saved your goddamn life,

25:41.266 --> 25:43.466
and you just continue
to repay me with paranoia!

25:48.520 --> 25:50.120
What were you doing here?

25:55.186 --> 25:56.897
I was looking for you

25:57.546 --> 25:59.262
to see if I could stay
at the loading dock.

26:00.038 --> 26:01.331
Are you crazy?

26:01.400 --> 26:03.100
No, but they are down there.

26:04.375 --> 26:06.408
They just threw Vic out of the mall.

26:06.572 --> 26:08.105
They're losing their minds.

26:10.442 --> 26:12.341
Come here.

26:15.620 --> 26:17.720
You need to do something
with your hands.

27:16.442 --> 27:21.953
_

27:27.100 --> 27:28.867
No.

27:28.919 --> 27:31.620
No. No, no, no, no, no.

27:31.689 --> 27:33.155
No.

27:40.364 --> 27:42.919
What...

27:46.503 --> 27:47.936
Shut up.

27:48.887 --> 27:50.587
♪ Love that hair ♪

27:50.633 --> 27:53.509

28:09.527 --> 28:11.026
How can it...

28:14.788 --> 28:17.608
You can't do this to me.

28:17.835 --> 28:19.821
It's not real.

28:21.219 --> 28:23.711
I-It's not real.

28:25.238 --> 28:27.505
Would you even know?

28:43.828 --> 28:44.760
Mrs. Raven.

28:45.443 --> 28:46.562
Oh.

28:46.630 --> 28:47.930
Hello, Link.

28:48.177 --> 28:50.432
Father Romanov
would like to talk to you.

29:10.154 --> 29:12.087
Why is Romanov up here?

29:14.458 --> 29:16.225
Oh! No, Link!

29:24.869 --> 29:27.870
Link, where is Father Romanov?

29:27.938 --> 29:29.338
You're not going anywhere

29:29.407 --> 29:31.673
until you agree to stop this heresy.

29:31.742 --> 29:34.143
- What heresy is that?
- You know what!

29:34.211 --> 29:36.812
You must repent and embrace God.

29:36.881 --> 29:39.782
- Link.
- Repent, and embrace God.

29:39.865 --> 29:43.567
He said, "The Lord is faithful
and that He will...

29:43.621 --> 29:45.587
He will strengthen and
protect us from the evil one."

29:45.656 --> 29:47.289
You think I'm evil, Link?

29:47.396 --> 29:48.862
You're leading them astray.

29:50.640 --> 29:51.973
Embrace Him!

29:52.229 --> 29:53.762
It's His house!

29:53.831 --> 29:56.914
- You'll respect Him!
- Link, let me help you.

29:57.063 --> 29:58.400
No!

30:00.704 --> 30:02.269
I don't...

30:02.740 --> 30:04.660
want to hurt you,

30:04.925 --> 30:08.060
but I will until you repent.

30:11.882 --> 30:16.913
And I will hurt you
much, much worse than this,

30:17.121 --> 30:19.148
and God will forgive me,

30:19.523 --> 30:20.823
'cause I'm doing this for Him.

30:23.203 --> 30:25.103
No. No, no, no!

30:25.263 --> 30:30.052
No! No, no!

30:30.134 --> 30:32.301
No, please! Please!

30:32.369 --> 30:33.669
Please!

30:33.737 --> 30:35.704
No. No, no, no.

30:35.773 --> 30:36.738
No, no, no, no!

30:36.807 --> 30:38.774
No, no, no, no!

30:38.843 --> 30:40.108
Please let me out!

30:40.177 --> 30:41.677
Open the door, please!

30:41.745 --> 30:44.046
Nathalie, please!

30:50.254 --> 30:52.917
I worked with a patient, uh, Marvin.

30:53.290 --> 30:54.823
He was suffering from dementia.

30:55.274 --> 30:57.459
30 seconds
after I exposed him to the mist,

30:57.528 --> 30:59.895
I heard a shotgun blast,
and his chest exploded.

30:59.964 --> 31:02.564
I removed shrapnel
from his chest cavity.

31:02.633 --> 31:04.399
And yesterday, I worked with Pam.

31:04.468 --> 31:06.545
30 seconds later,

31:06.770 --> 31:09.381
dogs appeared in the mist, her dogs.

31:09.540 --> 31:11.240
She was so happy to see them.

31:12.877 --> 31:14.243
Then they ate her.

31:15.679 --> 31:19.638
It reacts to us somehow
on a physiological level.

31:19.677 --> 31:20.749
I just don't know how yet,

31:20.818 --> 31:24.319
but if I can find out,
then I can save people.

31:24.997 --> 31:28.601
This will slow your metabolism
and your hormone output.

31:28.884 --> 31:31.609
Maybe I can slow
how the mist reacts to us.

31:32.392 --> 31:35.945
If it doesn't attack
after around 30 seconds,

31:36.367 --> 31:38.367
I'll know I'm on the right track.

32:09.833 --> 32:12.862
What's the matter, sweetie?

32:12.970 --> 32:16.644
Is your mind playing tricks on you?

32:16.840 --> 32:19.207
You must get that from me.

32:20.311 --> 32:22.692
I got nothing from you.

32:22.846 --> 32:26.121
How would you even know?

32:26.483 --> 32:30.459
You abandoned me in that horrible place.

32:31.021 --> 32:32.454
You...

32:33.791 --> 32:36.959
were supposed to take care of me.

32:37.027 --> 32:38.360
You're right.

32:38.429 --> 32:40.993
I wasn't a mother to you.

32:50.309 --> 32:55.010
All I ever wanted to do
was to take care of you...

32:57.259 --> 33:01.862
but I was frozen on that sofa.

33:04.391 --> 33:09.157
I begged myself to get up,
to go to you...

33:10.361 --> 33:16.031
but my mind wouldn't let me.

33:23.148 --> 33:24.514
I...

33:27.248 --> 33:29.148
I needed you.

33:41.125 --> 33:42.391
No.

33:43.527 --> 33:46.495
I understood why you left.

33:46.818 --> 33:49.564
Deep down, I was happy.

33:51.060 --> 33:53.068
You were finally free of me.

33:55.660 --> 33:57.172
Mom?

33:57.503 --> 33:59.408
Mm, baby doll.

34:00.577 --> 34:03.722
Every day, I tried to say it,

34:04.222 --> 34:06.982
but I could never get the words out.

34:09.085 --> 34:10.585
Say what?

34:12.275 --> 34:14.656
I love you.

34:18.161 --> 34:21.358
I wish I had been better.

34:21.899 --> 34:25.819
Don't you wish you could
have been a better daughter?

34:28.938 --> 34:30.272
Yes.

34:30.525 --> 34:34.242
Let me finally be a mother to you now.

34:36.880 --> 34:39.362
Let me help you die.

34:39.550 --> 34:42.217
I don't want to die. I don't.

34:42.286 --> 34:45.635
Oh, baby doll, yes, you do.

34:45.856 --> 34:50.859
You never realized, but we
were always in this together.

34:53.864 --> 34:55.797
I'm so tired.

34:55.866 --> 34:58.867
And you don't have to be any longer.

35:00.656 --> 35:03.089
You can stop running.

35:03.369 --> 35:06.037
There's no one waiting for you.

35:09.046 --> 35:10.045
You're wrong.

35:11.870 --> 35:14.253
Someone's waiting.

35:21.905 --> 35:23.304
Stop it!

36:00.238 --> 36:02.197
A minute and a half already.

36:02.476 --> 36:04.032
It's working.

36:06.103 --> 36:07.602
It's working.

36:23.887 --> 36:25.353
What?

36:28.592 --> 36:29.558
Who?

36:46.765 --> 36:47.897
What?

36:52.357 --> 36:53.924
What?

36:54.117 --> 36:55.984
Two minutes.

36:56.053 --> 36:58.119
Two...

36:58.188 --> 36:59.991
Get Kevin!

37:02.321 --> 37:04.094
Hurry up!

37:05.180 --> 37:06.733
Kevin!

37:08.297 --> 37:11.647
- Help!
- What are you doing?

37:18.976 --> 37:20.505
Help!

37:20.777 --> 37:22.210
- Help me.
- Get him up.

37:22.279 --> 37:23.372
Come on.

37:25.762 --> 37:26.871
Quick.

37:48.299 --> 37:50.306
Mom. Mom! No!

37:50.331 --> 37:51.823
I told you to stay away from her!

37:51.848 --> 37:53.514
Mom, stop! He saved me.

37:53.932 --> 37:56.536
Saved you? From what?
What happened to you?

37:56.604 --> 37:58.938
I stopped in a sporting goods
store on the way back.

37:59.007 --> 38:01.641
Someone locked me in the break room
and started a fire.

38:01.892 --> 38:04.717
- You did this.
- Look... Look at him.

38:04.779 --> 38:06.538
You want me to believe this?

38:06.641 --> 38:08.207
I don't care what you believe.

38:08.316 --> 38:10.683
Just quit blaming me
for shit I didn't do.

38:10.752 --> 38:13.071
- He needs our help.
- Gus can help him.

38:13.141 --> 38:14.520
He's scared of Gus!

38:14.589 --> 38:17.211
- They sent Vic out in the mist.
- I don't give a shit.

38:19.294 --> 38:21.117
Here's the thing, Eve.

38:21.485 --> 38:24.086
Kind of fed up with you trying to decide

38:24.132 --> 38:26.238
what I can and cannot do.

38:26.929 --> 38:28.495
And I just don't believe

38:28.540 --> 38:30.373
you're gonna shoot me
over where I crash.

38:37.178 --> 38:39.111
If I see you touching her...

38:40.199 --> 38:42.599
I will put a bullet

38:42.658 --> 38:45.484
in whatever body part
you touch her with.

38:47.856 --> 38:49.640
Understood?

38:49.858 --> 38:51.457
Yeah.

38:58.666 --> 39:00.132
Nathalie!

39:02.370 --> 39:03.803
What happened?

39:03.872 --> 39:06.839
The boy, Link, he attacked me.

39:06.908 --> 39:08.174
What? Here. Here. Here.

39:08.243 --> 39:09.675
Sit down.

39:09.744 --> 39:12.778
He dragged me to the tower,
and he hit me.

39:13.469 --> 39:16.515
He said he would hurt me again and again

39:16.618 --> 39:19.318
until I gave in to God's will.

39:20.655 --> 39:23.489
Nathalie, where is Link?

39:29.680 --> 39:32.094
All right, it's okay.
You don't have to tell me, but...

39:34.035 --> 39:36.102
The mist came.

39:37.438 --> 39:39.038
It saved me.

39:39.107 --> 39:40.882
It saved me from him.

39:41.242 --> 39:42.675
Why did he attack you?

39:44.045 --> 39:45.344
I don't know.

39:50.718 --> 39:52.853
Do you know why, Gregory?

40:03.072 --> 40:04.238
MAN; Hurry up!

40:05.271 --> 40:07.731
- Is the door locked?
- Come in.

40:08.631 --> 40:10.236
Guys, open it up for him.

40:14.405 --> 40:16.208
What... What is that?

40:17.770 --> 40:20.226
They just started coming down outside.

40:21.115 --> 40:22.868
It's the State Guard.

40:22.969 --> 40:24.050
They're coming!

40:39.023 --> 40:41.997
It's so wonderful.

40:42.278 --> 40:44.685
How long do you think it'll take?

40:44.770 --> 40:46.269
It could be today.

40:46.518 --> 40:47.817
Come in.

40:54.488 --> 40:55.621
What's he doing here?

40:55.704 --> 40:56.758
I'll tell you later.

40:56.813 --> 40:58.884
Just help me keep an eye on him.

40:58.953 --> 41:00.486
Yeah.

41:00.555 --> 41:01.854
See this?

41:13.839 --> 41:14.934
Look at this.

41:21.309 --> 41:23.109
We have to get out of this place.

41:24.227 --> 41:25.126
Hey.

41:27.849 --> 41:30.016
Where the hell have you been?

41:30.491 --> 41:32.314
I, uh, tried to find gas for us.

41:32.375 --> 41:33.953
Did you have to steal the keys for that?

41:36.190 --> 41:37.790
What the hell happened here?

41:42.810 --> 41:44.263
You gonna tell me what happened?

41:44.332 --> 41:45.631
We just need to get out.

41:45.700 --> 41:47.658
- Is the car outside?
- Yeah, it's...

41:47.704 --> 41:50.352
- The lights, the lights?
- Don't panic!

41:51.539 --> 41:53.305
Let's go. Let's go. That way.

41:53.374 --> 41:55.007
- The generator's out!
- Go. You need help?

41:55.076 --> 41:56.008
I'm good.

42:09.690 --> 42:11.057
Where's the car?

42:11.125 --> 42:12.878
No, no, no. We won't make it.

42:12.956 --> 42:15.094
Let's go. Follow me!

42:16.164 --> 42:17.417
What's going on?

42:17.488 --> 42:19.769
The electric doors opened
when the generator cut out.

42:19.823 --> 42:21.534
Then where the hell are we going?

42:21.602 --> 42:23.436
The only place the doors will stay shut.

42:23.504 --> 42:25.497
