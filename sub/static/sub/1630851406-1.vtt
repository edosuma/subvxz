<i>Fascinating me</i>

01:12:13.597 --> 01:12:20.671
<i>Aw. Changes are taking</i>
<i>the pace I'm going through</i>

01:12:20.671 --> 01:12:22.540
<i>Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes</i>

01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:24.942
<i>Turn and face the strain</i>

01:12:24.942 --> 01:12:26.744
<i>Ch-ch-changes</i>

01:12:26.744 --> 01:12:29.647
<i>Ooh. Iook out</i>
<i>you rock 'n rollers</i>

01:12:29.647 --> 01:12:31.949
<i>Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes</i>

01:12:31.949 --> 01:12:34.218
<i>Turn and face the strain</i>

01:12:34.218 --> 01:12:36.120
<i>Ch-ch-changes</i>

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:38.756
<i>Pretty soon now you're</i>
<i>gonna get a little older</i>

01:12:38.756 --> 01:12:41.892
<i>Time may change me</i>

01:12:41.892 --> 01:12:44.662
<i>But I can't trace time</i>

01:12:44.662 --> 01:12:47.965
<i>I said that</i>
<i>time may change me</i>

01:12:47.965 --> 01:12:54.200
<i>But I can't trace time</i>

01:13:05.916 --> 01:13:08.419
[Song fades out]

01:13:08.419 --> 01:13:10.910
["Couche-moi" begins]
