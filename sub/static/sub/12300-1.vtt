WEBVTT

00:57.724 --> 01:00.018
Flight 906, outbound Miami

01:00.018 --> 01:01.227
to DC

01:01.227 --> 01:02.937
Dropped off the radar at 08:20

01:02.937 --> 01:04.230
Crashed right after takeoff

01:04.230 --> 01:05.397
How many on board?

01:05.397 --> 01:06.232
NTSB confirms

01:06.232 --> 01:07.942
two pilots, six passengers

01:07.942 --> 01:09.361
Total of eight souls

01:09.361 --> 01:11.363
Eight souls unaccounted for. Okay

01:11.571 --> 01:13.281
Look, their advising that we
wait for fire and rescue...

01:13.281 --> 01:14.866
Tell them we were four miles away

01:14.866 --> 01:15.658
when we took the call

01:15.658 --> 01:17.243
First responders provide
immediate aid

01:17.243 --> 01:18.203
no questions asked

01:18.203 --> 01:19.412
We're taking this

01:19.412 --> 01:20.705
Call MDPD. Tell them I want to set a

01:20.705 --> 01:23.375
forward command post at
Levy 67 mobile recovery...

01:23.375 --> 01:25.460
biohazard gear, the works

01:25.460 --> 01:26.836
And then call in the night shift

01:26.836 --> 01:27.921
We need all hands on deck

01:27.921 --> 01:29.381
Eric Delko...hold on

01:29.381 --> 01:30.173
What

01:30.173 --> 01:32.217
What is it?

01:32.509 --> 01:33.677
Right there

01:35.095 --> 01:36.971
We've got a survivor right there!

01:36.971 --> 01:38.556
Hold on sir! I'm coming!

01:40.141 --> 01:41.518
Yes, this is Horatio Caine

01:41.518 --> 01:42.852
This is CSI priority

01:42.852 --> 01:44.354
I need an Air Rescue

01:44.354 --> 01:46.439
I'm located six miles from
the Tammeane Trail

01:48.233 --> 01:48.900
Hold on!

01:52.529 --> 01:53.738
He's not breathing!

01:56.616 --> 01:58.910
Breathe....breathe...

02:03.957 --> 02:04.791
com'on BREATHE!

02:05.834 --> 02:06.835
Eric

02:09.128 --> 02:10.045
Eric

02:12.048 --> 02:13.216
He's gone

02:17.303 --> 02:18.596
I lost him

02:18.888 --> 02:20.223
It happens

02:20.223 --> 02:22.183
He could of told us

02:22.183 --> 02:23.309
We don't need him to

02:25.562 --> 02:28.356
We've got the whole story right here

03:17.779 --> 03:20.698
The jet was registered to a
Scott Eric Summer

03:20.698 --> 03:23.201
He made the Fortune 500 insuring
half the Gulf Coast

03:23.201 --> 03:24.035
Did you get a flight plan yet?

03:24.035 --> 03:25.912
It went straight to NTSB

03:25.912 --> 03:27.038
They've got a go team flying in

03:27.038 --> 03:28.581
They've got a go team flying in

03:28.581 --> 03:29.791
What about fire and rescue?

03:30.333 --> 03:32.543
They just went out to
look for survivors

03:32.752 --> 03:35.046
Delko's with them

03:37.090 --> 03:38.633
Is it as bad as it looks?

03:38.633 --> 03:41.177
It's actually worse than it looks

04:51.289 --> 04:52.790
NTSB is on their way in

04:52.790 --> 04:54.709
They're gonna want updates

04:54.709 --> 04:57.879
Flight logistics, weather,
eye witness reports.

04:57.879 --> 04:59.630
Welcome back, Megan

04:59.630 --> 05:01.549
I didn't know you were
gonna be in this week

05:01.549 --> 05:02.717
Any survivors?

05:03.092 --> 05:04.218
Nothing new

05:04.635 --> 05:06.095
They'll be found in the first
few hours if we find

05:06.095 --> 05:07.430
any at all

05:07.430 --> 05:08.848
how are we doing on safety?

05:08.848 --> 05:10.224
We got it covered

05:11.601 --> 05:13.853
This is a level two biohazard site

05:13.853 --> 05:15.897
We should be taking precautions

05:15.897 --> 05:17.690
All personnel should have
Tyvek overalls on

05:17.690 --> 05:21.277
double gloves,  masks and
decontamination after every shift

05:21.277 --> 05:22.987
Everyone doses up on antibiotics

05:22.987 --> 05:24.822
Water is full of blood
borne pathogens

05:24.822 --> 05:26.282
and bacteria from body decomp

05:26.282 --> 05:28.451
Not to mention six thousand
pounds of Jet A fuel

05:28.451 --> 05:30.161
No shift should last more
than twenty minutes

05:30.161 --> 05:31.287
No food, no or water on site

05:31.287 --> 05:32.580
They won't be able to eat out there

05:32.580 --> 05:33.539
Spray from the airboat props

05:33.539 --> 05:34.624
cause contamination

05:34.624 --> 05:36.250
We're treating this as a crime scene

05:36.250 --> 05:38.044
which means no object too small

05:38.044 --> 05:39.629
any doubts, bag it, tag it

05:39.629 --> 05:40.505
Ok

05:43.758 --> 05:46.344
See if you can get me a
copy of the flight plan

05:48.054 --> 05:49.972
It's nice to see you too

05:58.606 --> 06:00.024
Thinking bomb?

06:01.984 --> 06:03.778
Well the jury's still out

06:04.278 --> 06:05.780
Welcome back Megan

06:06.781 --> 06:08.116
Welcome back Megan ask?

06:08.116 --> 06:09.492
You're the expert

06:09.492 --> 06:10.618
Well, no gas puncture

06:10.618 --> 06:12.161
no pitting, no thining of metal

06:12.161 --> 06:13.246
no thermal effect

06:13.246 --> 06:15.707
we still have to swab for RDXPETN

06:15.707 --> 06:16.791
but I think we'll know more when the

06:16.791 --> 06:17.792
evidence comes in

06:17.792 --> 06:19.168
NTSB told us to hold off

06:19.168 --> 06:20.461
on recovery

06:21.170 --> 06:22.755
Yeah but they're not
here yet, are they?

06:22.755 --> 06:25.174
Horatio, we've been
through this before

06:25.174 --> 06:27.010
ValueJet '96. I recall it well

06:27.427 --> 06:28.970
Then I don't need to remind you.
The Feds have

06:28.970 --> 06:31.597
jurisdiction over any air crash

06:31.597 --> 06:33.057
They deputize local agencies

06:33.057 --> 06:34.308
We're working for them

06:34.600 --> 06:36.644
The  Everglades is a slow moving

06:36.644 --> 06:39.689
river with a current that travels
about four feet per hour

06:39.689 --> 06:40.648
I  know

06:40.648 --> 06:43.067
The crash site slowly degrading
while we standing here

06:43.067 --> 06:44.068
We're losing evidence

06:44.068 --> 06:44.902
Four feet per hour

06:44.902 --> 06:46.946
We need to processing right now

06:46.946 --> 06:48.489
That's not your call, or mine

06:48.489 --> 06:49.240
Ok

06:55.288 --> 06:57.790
Listen. I am sorry for the way
things turned out for you

06:57.790 --> 07:00.043
but I did not ask for this job

07:00.043 --> 07:00.918
I know

07:01.294 --> 07:03.546
Anytime you want to take it back,
let me know

07:04.797 --> 07:06.382
That's not my call either

07:06.632 --> 07:08.593
Until then, let's get to work

07:17.643 --> 07:19.270
How are we doing on survivors?

07:19.270 --> 07:20.438
Not good

07:20.438 --> 07:21.814
How many do you got in here?

07:21.814 --> 07:24.484
Four  or five, depending on
which pieces match

07:25.318 --> 07:26.778
Injuries are consistent
with catastrophic

07:26.778 --> 07:28.780
blunt force trauama

07:28.780 --> 07:30.490
This type of crash

07:30.490 --> 07:32.283
Was it normal for you?

07:32.283 --> 07:33.826
You didn't get up this morning

07:33.826 --> 07:36.287
thinking it was your last,
did you honey?

07:36.287 --> 07:39.457
Ask him, if he knows what brought
the plane down

07:42.877 --> 07:45.672
Well, I think he might have just
answered your question

07:46.255 --> 07:48.424
Small entry wound in the upper torso

07:57.433 --> 07:59.102
It got him through and through

08:00.353 --> 08:01.270
Calleigh please

08:03.856 --> 08:04.982
Take a look at this

08:10.238 --> 08:12.073
Looks like a medium caliber

08:12.323 --> 08:13.991
Maybe a .32 or a .38

08:13.991 --> 08:16.327
And the bullet maybe still
lodged in the fuselage

08:16.327 --> 08:17.620
Think we can find it?

08:17.870 --> 08:19.497
Does Elvis wear a white jumpsuit?

08:26.337 --> 08:27.630
What else can you tell me

08:27.630 --> 08:29.257
We were just out there fishing

08:29.590 --> 08:33.219
Heard a noise.  Real loud.
Looked up and Boom!

08:33.219 --> 08:34.554
That's all we saw

08:34.554 --> 08:35.763
Did you approach the plane?

08:35.763 --> 08:37.390
No sir, we high tailed it out of there

08:37.390 --> 08:39.433
Phoned 911

08:39.433 --> 08:40.977
You didn't think to look
for any survivors

08:40.977 --> 08:42.770
Hey, we called you remember?

08:42.770 --> 08:45.440
Shouldn't we get a reward
or something like that?

08:51.154 --> 08:52.280
Fishing my ass

08:52.780 --> 08:55.700
Did you see the size of that
rifle on their boat? .306?

08:58.286 --> 08:59.746
They were poaching gators

09:00.413 --> 09:01.789
There are panthers out
in the 'Glades

09:01.789 --> 09:04.375
How do you know the rifle
is not for protection?

09:04.375 --> 09:05.918
How do you know they didn't
borrow the boat and

09:05.918 --> 09:07.378
the owner left his rifle inside?

09:07.378 --> 09:09.213
I trust my gut

09:09.213 --> 09:10.506
It seems pretty obvious

09:10.506 --> 09:12.633
You sound just like Horatio

09:12.925 --> 09:14.218
The problem with the obvious, Tim

09:14.218 --> 09:16.971
is that it can make you
overlook the evidence

10:14.612 --> 10:16.698
What do you make of this?

10:18.199 --> 10:20.868
Electronic fuel injector.
Like in my car

10:20.868 --> 10:22.620
Look closer

10:30.545 --> 10:32.964
Serial number looks like it's
been worn down

10:32.964 --> 10:34.507
Could be strippened

10:34.507 --> 10:36.009
It's a used part

10:36.009 --> 10:37.969
Shined up, given a phony
serial number, sold as new

10:37.969 --> 10:39.554
It's an old trick

10:39.804 --> 10:41.264
I'll have Speedle look into it

10:41.264 --> 10:43.975
I need Speedle look into it

10:47.979 --> 10:49.313
I'll take care of it

10:49.313 --> 10:50.231
Thank you

10:58.865 --> 11:00.158
Hey Herb Ritzm, come on

11:00.158 --> 11:02.910
Do you want to do this while
we're young or what?

11:02.910 --> 11:04.120
I need a minute

11:04.120 --> 11:05.872
How about I take the pictures and

11:05.872 --> 11:07.040
you go out there and

11:07.040 --> 11:08.624
backstroke in that crap

11:09.542 --> 11:10.418
You alright?

11:10.418 --> 11:12.587
Yeah, I'm fine. You alright?

11:13.087 --> 11:13.963
Gentlemen

11:16.257 --> 11:17.300
Sorry H

11:17.592 --> 11:18.634
Stay focused

11:18.634 --> 11:20.011
We were just talking about

11:20.011 --> 11:21.429
after a plane crash like this

11:21.429 --> 11:23.264
they used to find all these
passengers without any feet

11:23.264 --> 11:24.474
They couldn't figure out why

11:24.474 --> 11:25.892
But it turns out there's
a support bar

11:25.892 --> 11:28.061
under the seat that was
acting like a guillotine

11:29.896 --> 11:32.190
This seatbelt is unbuckled
and undamaged

11:34.400 --> 11:35.193
Well the flight wasn't full

11:35.193 --> 11:36.069
That's, uh...

11:37.028 --> 11:38.571
six passengers, eight empty seats

11:38.571 --> 11:39.739
Yeah but I've already counted

11:39.739 --> 11:41.574
nine unbuckled belts,
so that would mean

11:41.574 --> 11:43.493
one of the passengers
was unbuckled during

11:43.493 --> 11:45.078
take off, doesn't it?

11:45.078 --> 11:46.287
Might have been the guy
who shot the pilot

11:48.164 --> 11:48.998
Might have been

11:52.335 --> 11:53.586
How's everyone holding up?

11:54.128 --> 11:54.837
They're fine,

11:54.837 --> 11:56.172
they're doing their jobs

12:17.193 --> 12:18.528
What have you got?

12:19.529 --> 12:20.613
Nothing

12:22.699 --> 12:24.909
Not a pen, not a piece of paper,
not a paper clip

12:24.909 --> 12:26.452
nothing

12:26.452 --> 12:28.371
Who travels with an
empty brief case?

12:28.371 --> 12:29.539
That's odd right?

12:29.539 --> 12:30.540
Yeah

12:30.540 --> 12:32.333
H, com'on!

12:33.710 --> 12:35.878
Rescue, I need a paramedic! NOW!

12:37.088 --> 12:38.798
We got one with a pulse!

12:40.675 --> 12:41.926
Eric! Don't let him go

12:41.926 --> 12:42.719
into shock

12:42.719 --> 12:44.095
He's got a pulsate

12:46.055 --> 12:48.182
Sir, Sir, can you hear me?

12:48.182 --> 12:49.726
Stay with us

12:50.810 --> 12:51.728
Breathe, breathe

12:51.728 --> 12:53.396
Stay with us

13:00.545 --> 13:02.380
Ok, I'll meet you there

13:02.380 --> 13:03.173
Good

13:04.424 --> 13:06.051
H, We've got a Scott Eric Sommer

13:06.051 --> 13:07.385
Resides at Gables Estate

13:07.385 --> 13:08.345
He's unconscious

13:08.345 --> 13:09.262
but hold on guys

13:09.262 --> 13:10.847
He can't tell us anything then

13:10.847 --> 13:12.182
Maybe he can

13:12.182 --> 13:13.642
What do you see?

13:13.642 --> 13:15.602
No friction burn, right?

13:15.602 --> 13:16.936
Means, no seatbelt

13:16.936 --> 13:18.396
So he might be our shooter

13:18.688 --> 13:19.481
Yes, the question then becomes

13:19.481 --> 13:21.274
why would you shoot
your own pilot?

13:21.274 --> 13:22.192
Thank you, gentleman

13:25.278 --> 13:26.154
- Horatio?
- Ya

13:26.154 --> 13:27.447
Got a call about a floater

13:27.447 --> 13:29.824
five miles from here

13:29.824 --> 13:32.035
I can't possibly take another
scene right now

13:32.035 --> 13:33.662
Horatio, it is your scene

13:54.766 --> 13:56.017
Okay

14:00.063 --> 14:03.149
How did you get so far
from your friends?

14:03.775 --> 14:05.652
Did you fall out of that plane?

14:05.652 --> 14:08.154
Is that how you ended up
all alone out there?

14:08.154 --> 14:09.823
All by yourself?

14:09.823 --> 14:12.033
In more ways than one, I'll bet

14:12.033 --> 14:13.994
Only woman on board

14:13.994 --> 14:16.413
that couldn't have been easy

14:16.413 --> 14:18.373
You were with them,

14:18.623 --> 14:19.916
but not one of them

14:19.916 --> 14:21.126
"All Boys Express"

14:21.126 --> 14:22.377
Been on that flight

14:22.627 --> 14:23.378
Ladies

14:27.257 --> 14:30.093
We may have an ID
on the flight plan

14:30.093 --> 14:32.470
Christina Maria Calluchi

14:32.470 --> 14:34.681
was Summer's senior accountant

14:36.141 --> 14:39.227
Hello Christina

14:41.438 --> 14:44.816
Preliminary exam indicates no
friction burns on her

14:44.816 --> 14:45.817
lower torso

14:45.817 --> 14:46.860
Which also means

14:46.860 --> 14:48.153
no seatbelt and

14:48.153 --> 14:50.530
a second passenger out
of their seat

14:50.530 --> 14:53.366
- I'd rule out the bathroom then
- Mile high club?

14:53.366 --> 14:54.451
I don't think so

14:54.451 --> 14:56.328
It's such a small plane

14:56.328 --> 14:58.872
It'd be hard to have an indiscreet
affair with your boss, I think

14:58.872 --> 15:00.623
Not if he was picking up the tab

15:00.623 --> 15:03.043
This stuff is all designer

15:03.043 --> 15:04.085
Red suede

15:04.085 --> 15:05.545
450 bucks a pair

15:05.545 --> 15:07.047
Price alone coulda killed her

15:08.340 --> 15:10.258
I put a rush on the tox screen

15:10.258 --> 15:11.926
Blood alcohol was .09

15:11.926 --> 15:14.512
Legally drunk at 8 o'clock
in the morning?

15:14.512 --> 15:17.140
We also found traces of fluoxitine

15:17.849 --> 15:18.933
She was on Prozac

15:18.933 --> 15:20.644
Who isn't

15:22.687 --> 15:24.731
Anything  you want to share?

15:24.731 --> 15:26.691
Not currently

15:26.691 --> 15:29.611
Could I have a grid please?

15:31.821 --> 15:34.532
C-6 enlarge please

15:36.201 --> 15:39.079
Zoom times four and hold

15:40.664 --> 15:43.249
Zoom eight times and hold

15:48.421 --> 15:50.507
What in the heck are those?

15:54.552 --> 15:56.596
Could be impact related

15:56.596 --> 15:58.598
Something she hit?

15:58.598 --> 16:00.725
Or something that hit her

16:05.689 --> 16:07.732
She's a lovely girl

16:10.944 --> 16:12.529
Mrs. Calluchi

16:12.946 --> 16:15.073
I found this at the crash site

16:15.073 --> 16:16.116
It was empty

16:16.116 --> 16:19.160
and it has what I believe are
Christina's initials on it

16:19.160 --> 16:21.621
I  was wondering if that
belonged to her

16:22.831 --> 16:24.082
We, um,

16:24.624 --> 16:28.003
we gave that to her when
she got her promotion

16:28.003 --> 16:29.587
Has she, uh,

16:29.838 --> 16:31.047
recently

16:31.965 --> 16:34.259
suffered any setbacks either

16:34.259 --> 16:36.678
personally or professionally?

16:36.678 --> 16:38.513
Not that I know of

16:39.347 --> 16:41.641
My daughter battled depression

16:41.850 --> 16:44.519
When she was in high school...

16:44.978 --> 16:47.897
that was a very long time ago

16:50.817 --> 16:53.361
She would never try to hurt herself,

16:53.862 --> 16:55.280
would she?

16:58.074 --> 16:59.451
I don't know

16:59.743 --> 17:02.829
Ever  since she was a little girl

17:03.788 --> 17:07.916
she was so good at keeping secrets

17:12.797 --> 17:15.342
Will you help me please?

17:16.925 --> 17:18.511
I will

17:21.513 --> 17:22.807
I will

17:38.615 --> 17:40.158
I've never seen one of these before

17:40.700 --> 17:41.993
This old thing?

17:41.993 --> 17:42.786
Yeah

17:42.786 --> 17:44.287
It's a boroscope

17:44.287 --> 17:46.414
The SWAT boys use it for
a sneak and peek

17:46.623 --> 17:48.583
I think it's kind of cute

17:48.792 --> 17:50.210
Can I take a peek?

17:50.460 --> 17:51.294
Be my guest

17:53.004 --> 17:53.922
So, uh,

17:54.172 --> 17:56.466
what exactly are we
looking for here?

17:56.466 --> 17:57.801
Ballistics evidence

17:57.801 --> 17:59.761
We think we may have had
a shooting on the plane

17:59.761 --> 18:01.930
but so far, nada

18:01.930 --> 18:03.390
You know, I've heard of you

18:03.598 --> 18:06.226
You're the, uh, Bullet Girl, right?

18:06.893 --> 18:09.729
What does that make you?
Airplane boy?

18:10.188 --> 18:11.481
Yeah, I guess you can say I'm

18:11.481 --> 18:13.525
aware on an airframe

18:13.525 --> 18:14.693
Really?

18:15.735 --> 18:17.153
Then what are these?

18:18.405 --> 18:20.490
Those are bayonnette pins

18:20.490 --> 18:22.325
They hold the door shut

18:22.325 --> 18:23.994
Oh, I know that

18:23.994 --> 18:26.454
I meant what are those

18:26.788 --> 18:28.999
Some type of scoring

18:29.666 --> 18:32.210
Could mean the door failed

18:32.752 --> 18:35.380
Or someone wanted it to

18:38.800 --> 18:42.053
Eric, How are we doing
on those black boxes?

18:42.053 --> 18:43.138
I'm heading back now

18:43.138 --> 18:45.307
I just came back to dose
up on those antibiotics

18:45.307 --> 18:46.683
As soon as you know...

18:46.933 --> 18:47.767
okay

18:49.394 --> 18:51.980
I just spoke to the pilot's widow

18:51.980 --> 18:53.565
How's she doing?

18:53.565 --> 18:55.233
Her radio car is with her now,

18:55.233 --> 18:56.818
She's pretty hysterical

18:56.818 --> 18:58.611
The thing is boss, she kept going on

18:58.611 --> 19:00.280
about Summer and all the top brass

19:00.280 --> 19:02.240
screwing over the rank and file

19:02.240 --> 19:04.326
You want to know why
they were going to DC?

19:04.326 --> 19:05.577
They were being investigated

19:05.577 --> 19:08.747
by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, weren't they?

19:08.747 --> 19:10.123
These are copies of subpoenas

19:10.123 --> 19:11.458
for Sommer and his chief

19:11.458 --> 19:13.293
financial officers

19:13.293 --> 19:14.502
It's classic

19:14.502 --> 19:16.671
Company fails and the
management bails

19:16.671 --> 19:18.798
The boss sails into retirement
with a golden parachute

19:18.798 --> 19:20.884
and a big fat severance
package, right?

19:20.884 --> 19:23.219
Yeah and then Joe Cubicle
gets a nice pink slip

19:23.219 --> 19:24.846
and a frozen pension plan

19:24.846 --> 19:27.557
That whole plane load was on
the to Washington to be grilled

19:27.557 --> 19:29.684
by the SEC

19:30.018 --> 19:31.269
You're not gonna believe this

19:31.269 --> 19:32.479
What's the matter?

19:32.479 --> 19:34.522
Bayonnette pins holding the door

19:34.522 --> 19:36.524
were filed down. NTSB concurs.

19:36.524 --> 19:39.319
That door opened in flight

19:42.739 --> 19:43.823
That explains our victim

19:43.823 --> 19:45.992
that ended up five miles
from the crash

19:45.992 --> 19:47.077
Sabotage?

19:47.077 --> 19:48.203
Company's in trouble

19:48.203 --> 19:49.829
A lot of employees ticked
off at the boss

19:49.829 --> 19:51.039
Exit doors pins were tampered

19:51.039 --> 19:52.290
with most likely by someone

19:52.290 --> 19:54.668
who knew their way
around jet aircraft

19:54.668 --> 19:56.211
Means, motive

19:56.211 --> 19:58.213
All they needed was an opportunity

19:58.213 --> 20:01.466
Let's find out who
worked on that plane

20:56.771 --> 20:58.231
Good as good?

20:59.232 --> 21:00.817
Good as good

21:01.609 --> 21:03.069
Nice going

21:05.196 --> 21:06.906
Senior Esparsa, we know that

21:06.906 --> 21:09.326
you have been using old parts

21:10.285 --> 21:12.370
on company planes

21:14.039 --> 21:15.582
And I want to know why

21:17.542 --> 21:19.085
You make money on the side?

21:21.963 --> 21:23.256
No. No par me

21:24.382 --> 21:27.010
You trying to get back at someone?

21:27.010 --> 21:29.929
Is that why you sabotaged

21:29.929 --> 21:31.264
the exit door?

21:31.514 --> 21:33.683
No comprendo.  I did nothing wrong

21:33.683 --> 21:36.394
We matched the markings to
your tools. We know it is

21:36.394 --> 21:39.022
you who filed down the pins

21:40.190 --> 21:41.691
I had to make them fit

21:42.651 --> 21:44.986
We didn't have the right parts

21:46.821 --> 21:47.822
I work hard

21:47.822 --> 21:48.990
I get those planes up in the air

21:48.990 --> 21:51.493
Nobody asks how at 30,000 ft

21:53.870 --> 21:55.497
The plane was climbing

21:57.082 --> 22:00.001
How high did this plane
get Calleigh?

22:00.001 --> 22:01.127
Tower radar says

22:01.127 --> 22:03.338
no higher than 4,000 ft

22:04.673 --> 22:06.216
4,000 ft?

22:11.262 --> 22:12.889
I'm cutting him loose

22:12.889 --> 22:17.143
Why? He just confessed to using
faulty parts on that plane

22:17.143 --> 22:19.270
They were flying too low

22:21.022 --> 22:22.232
There was no depressurization

22:22.232 --> 22:23.191
That's right, which is why that door

22:23.191 --> 22:25.485
couldn't have come off by itself,
faulty pins or not

22:27.320 --> 22:29.906
It was opened from the inside

22:29.906 --> 22:32.075
Which reduces it to two
possibilities, doesn't it?

22:32.075 --> 22:35.245
Suicide or murder

22:38.456 --> 22:39.457
You need to talk to your survivor

22:39.457 --> 22:40.792
He's in a coma

22:40.792 --> 22:42.002
Not anymore

22:42.002 --> 22:43.670
Grace Memorial just called

22:43.670 --> 22:45.088
He woke up

23:00.727 --> 23:02.354
Did uh,

23:02.604 --> 23:06.024
did anybody else?
Any of them...make it?

23:06.441 --> 23:07.442
Just you

23:07.442 --> 23:08.568
I'm sorry

23:08.568 --> 23:10.237
We're gonna take care of them

23:10.237 --> 23:12.155
Families

23:12.155 --> 23:14.908
I mean, we take care of our own

23:14.908 --> 23:16.535
That's very commendable

23:16.535 --> 23:18.370
Especially recently in light of your

23:18.370 --> 23:21.289
company's recent
financial difficulties

23:21.581 --> 23:23.583
I'm not sure if I know
what you mean

23:23.583 --> 23:25.293
We hear that the SEC
is very interested in

23:25.293 --> 23:27.712
how you take care of your own

23:27.712 --> 23:29.631
May I ask you where
this is heading?

23:29.631 --> 23:31.132
We'd like to get your

23:31.132 --> 23:32.926
fingerprints and a sample of

23:32.926 --> 23:35.262
your DNA if that's alright with you

23:35.262 --> 23:36.179
Wait a minute

23:36.805 --> 23:38.598
Do I need to have a lawyer present?

23:38.598 --> 23:39.432
Mr. Sommer

23:39.432 --> 23:41.101
we are merely trying to establish

23:41.101 --> 23:43.562
what happened on the plane
from your point of view

23:43.562 --> 23:44.646
That's all

23:44.646 --> 23:46.273
I don't remember

23:48.400 --> 23:50.861
It's all just a....it's fuzzy

23:50.861 --> 23:52.112
Well, maybe I can

23:52.112 --> 23:53.572
refresh your memory then,
what we do know

23:53.572 --> 23:56.867
is your employee Christina
Calluchi fell to her death

23:56.867 --> 23:59.369
sometime before the plane crashed

23:59.369 --> 24:02.664
And she fell out a door that
had been opened from the

24:02.664 --> 24:04.040
inside

24:04.040 --> 24:05.917
Does that ring a bell?

24:05.917 --> 24:09.629
No.  I didn't see anything

24:09.629 --> 24:10.672
I was in my seat

24:10.672 --> 24:11.673
Actually...Sir,

24:11.673 --> 24:13.884
you weren't in your seat

24:13.884 --> 24:15.594
And neither was Christina

24:15.594 --> 24:16.928
which is why there were no

24:16.928 --> 24:19.723
friction burns from your seatbelts

24:19.723 --> 24:20.640
So,

24:20.640 --> 24:22.809
would you like to try again?

24:27.022 --> 24:30.108
I didn't want to say anything
because I want to protect her

24:31.818 --> 24:36.323
Christina was acting strangely,
that morning

24:36.323 --> 24:38.492
she was very agitated

24:38.992 --> 24:40.494
And she had been drinking

24:44.331 --> 24:46.374
Don't take that with alcohol

24:48.335 --> 24:49.836
Get off of me

24:55.967 --> 24:57.052
You're saying,

24:57.052 --> 24:58.470
she committed suicide

24:58.470 --> 25:03.225
I'm saying she jumped
out the plane

25:03.225 --> 25:04.226
Why didn't you stop her

25:04.226 --> 25:05.352
I tried to

25:05.352 --> 25:06.520
There 's just no time

25:06.520 --> 25:09.272
When that door opened

25:09.272 --> 25:11.983
she was gone, just like that

25:14.361 --> 25:16.947
I don't remember anything
after that

25:18.698 --> 25:21.785
There is something I
wanted to ask you

25:21.785 --> 25:25.121
When did you hear the gunshot?

25:26.373 --> 25:27.666
Gun shot?

25:28.500 --> 25:29.835
What gun shot?

25:30.377 --> 25:31.711
No gun shot

25:32.879 --> 25:33.880
Um,

25:34.381 --> 25:35.382
would it be ok

25:35.382 --> 25:37.467
if we took your prints now

26:40.071 --> 26:42.324
You ran a chemical
profile on her hair?

26:42.324 --> 26:43.950
Trace elements can generally

26:43.950 --> 26:45.202
be found on the follicles

26:45.202 --> 26:46.870
Luckly she was a brunette

26:46.870 --> 26:48.163
Right.  Dark hair

26:48.163 --> 26:50.373
stores higher concentrations
of contaminents

26:51.458 --> 26:54.211
Nice thing about hair is
that it grows at

26:54.211 --> 26:57.005
an even rate, about a half
an inch per month

26:57.297 --> 26:58.965
Gives us a nice timeline

26:58.965 --> 27:00.300
She's been using

27:00.300 --> 27:01.843
antidepressants for the past year

27:01.843 --> 27:03.136
Prozac and Zolaft

27:03.136 --> 27:05.847
Six months ago,
she smoked some pot

27:05.847 --> 27:08.850
And they say blondes have more fun

27:08.850 --> 27:10.811
Here's the interesting part

27:10.811 --> 27:12.938
Three months ago,
huge spike of Dilated

27:12.938 --> 27:17.025
Painkiller? Maybe she had a
car accident, surgury or..

27:17.317 --> 27:19.903
Not according to her
medical records

27:19.903 --> 27:22.197
And not at these levels

27:22.197 --> 27:23.865
Suicide attempt?

27:23.865 --> 27:25.534
Mass spec doesn't lie

27:25.534 --> 27:27.160
Suicide is the only explanation

27:27.160 --> 27:29.371
She was front and center
in a SEC investigation

27:29.371 --> 27:31.331
She knew where all the
bodies were buried

27:31.331 --> 27:32.874
Maybe she couldn't
live with that

27:32.874 --> 27:34.543
Maybe someone couldn't
live with her?

27:34.543 --> 27:36.169
She tried to kill herself
three months ago

27:36.169 --> 27:37.295
Tried but failed

27:37.295 --> 27:38.922
Well, maybe this time
she succeeded

27:38.922 --> 27:41.216
Most whistleblowers are women

27:41.216 --> 27:42.342
I think she was planning to take

27:42.342 --> 27:43.552
the company down

27:43.552 --> 27:45.220
We'll never know that, will we?

27:45.220 --> 27:46.346
Her testimoney died with her

27:46.346 --> 27:48.056
Much to her boss's benefit now that

27:48.056 --> 27:49.141
she cannot testify

27:49.141 --> 27:50.308
You want to kill someone

27:50.308 --> 27:52.018
there's easier ways than
to shooting the pilot

27:52.018 --> 27:53.186
especially when you're
on the same flight

27:53.186 --> 27:55.730
A woman was murdered
on that plane

27:56.064 --> 27:57.941
That's a hunch talking

27:57.941 --> 27:59.568
Where's the evidence?

27:59.568 --> 28:01.236
Show me you're right

28:04.698 --> 28:06.158
That can't be good

28:07.534 --> 28:08.952
What does she think?

28:08.952 --> 28:10.954
She can waltz in here after
six months of being gone

28:10.954 --> 28:12.998
and just take over?

28:14.124 --> 28:15.250
You know...

28:15.709 --> 28:16.710
you're an ass

28:16.710 --> 28:18.170
What did I say?

28:18.170 --> 28:19.754
She lost her husband

28:19.754 --> 28:21.965
What did they give her...
two weeks off

28:21.965 --> 28:23.633
She needed a little bit of time

28:23.633 --> 28:25.135
Big deal

28:26.470 --> 28:27.804
Man, I didn't know

28:27.804 --> 28:30.348
Yeah well there's a
lot you don't know

28:34.895 --> 28:36.938
Gentlemen, those black boxes

28:36.938 --> 28:39.232
We've been over the sight twice

28:39.649 --> 28:41.693
And sonar pingers are supposed to

28:41.693 --> 28:43.904
activate automatically when
the boxes hit the water

28:43.904 --> 28:46.114
We're doing everything we can

28:46.114 --> 28:47.324
We need to do better

28:47.324 --> 28:48.450
As soon as you can

28:51.995 --> 28:53.997
Maybe you just missed them

28:53.997 --> 28:55.123
No way

28:55.123 --> 28:58.293
They're gone.
I don't know where else to look

29:02.589 --> 29:04.716
You know what, I think I do

29:22.859 --> 29:24.903
Survey says

29:34.746 --> 29:36.039
Ok, we've run the prints

29:36.039 --> 29:38.083
The green runs are Christina's

29:38.083 --> 29:39.751
the red ones are Sommer

29:39.751 --> 29:41.545
and he is all over this door

29:41.545 --> 29:42.838
He said he tried to stop her

29:42.838 --> 29:44.256
That's what he says

29:44.256 --> 29:46.967
Let's go through his story

29:46.967 --> 29:49.177
Christina's gonna kill herself

29:49.177 --> 29:51.012
She gets out of her seat

29:51.012 --> 29:53.723
and goes to the door.
But Summer

29:53.974 --> 29:56.017
comes after her, tries to stop her

29:56.017 --> 29:57.144
They struggle

29:57.144 --> 29:59.146
Why does he have a hand print

29:59.146 --> 30:01.982
so high up here

30:04.025 --> 30:06.361
Maybe her other hand was here

30:06.361 --> 30:07.529
Okay

30:07.529 --> 30:11.700
He's got prints on the
handle down here

30:12.993 --> 30:15.412
Could've put his hands
there to brace himself

30:16.663 --> 30:17.873
Why doesn't he just

30:17.873 --> 30:19.291
take both hands, grab her

30:19.499 --> 30:21.585
and pull her away from the door

30:25.172 --> 30:27.591
She's trying to get the door open

30:29.468 --> 30:31.011
Maybe he's trying to stop her

30:31.011 --> 30:32.554
Or maybe it was the
other way around

30:33.472 --> 30:34.431
It's inconclusive

30:34.431 --> 30:37.267
There's any number of ways
it could've played out

30:37.267 --> 30:38.435
Unless, now bear with me,
bear with me...

30:39.811 --> 30:40.812
Unless

30:43.690 --> 30:46.276
Summer's said that Christina

30:46.276 --> 30:48.361
fell out of the plane

30:48.904 --> 30:49.988
as soon

30:49.988 --> 30:51.907
as the door opened

30:51.907 --> 30:54.159
She was hanging on

30:57.204 --> 30:58.121
No

30:59.080 --> 31:00.624
She was hanging on

31:00.624 --> 31:02.042
She was hanging on

31:08.715 --> 31:09.716
Nurse,

31:09.716 --> 31:12.511
The patient that was in
this room, where is he?

31:12.511 --> 31:14.971
He checked himself out
about an hour ago

31:26.657 --> 31:28.408
What the hell is this?

31:28.408 --> 31:30.452
That's a warrant to search
the premises

31:30.452 --> 31:31.787
For what?

31:31.787 --> 31:34.039
For items looted from
an aircrash site

31:34.039 --> 31:37.459
What you think, you
gonna sell it on Ebay?

31:37.918 --> 31:39.711
Hey you got a locater signal?

31:39.711 --> 31:40.546
Yep

31:48.053 --> 31:49.930
Why don't you go get them?

31:49.930 --> 31:51.807
Why don't you?

31:56.061 --> 31:58.397
They're just babies

31:58.397 --> 31:59.731
What are you waiting for?

31:59.731 --> 32:01.650
Let's go

32:05.154 --> 32:06.155
On three

32:06.697 --> 32:07.698
One

32:08.949 --> 32:09.908
Two

32:11.034 --> 32:11.869
Three

32:23.797 --> 32:25.048
Ok, black boxes

32:25.048 --> 32:27.217
I understand that they're
really orange

32:27.217 --> 32:30.512
This one over here is a
cockpit voice recorder

32:30.512 --> 32:32.931
It records the last thirty
minutes of conversation

32:32.931 --> 32:35.142
over the cockpit mics

32:35.142 --> 32:37.060
This is a flight data recorder

32:37.060 --> 32:39.396
Documents forty
parameters of the flight

32:39.605 --> 32:42.191
Airspeed, flaps, trim, the works

32:42.441 --> 32:45.027
So this will help us with a timeline

32:45.027 --> 32:47.154
to figure out why it
went down, Peter?

32:49.907 --> 32:53.452
Eagle 906, fly runway heading,
Runway 9

32:53.452 --> 32:56.288
- Cleared for takeoff
- Set takeoff power

32:56.288 --> 32:57.873
100 knots

32:57.873 --> 32:59.249
Power is set

32:59.458 --> 33:00.667
See that game last night?

33:00.667 --> 33:02.377
Dolphins pretty good this year

33:02.377 --> 33:04.046
They'll never make the playoffs
without a quarterback

33:04.046 --> 33:06.173
The first four minutes after
takeoff are normal

33:06.173 --> 33:09.176
It gets pretty funky after that

33:10.010 --> 33:11.136
This is the Captain

33:11.470 --> 33:13.013
Our flight time to Washington D.C.

33:13.013 --> 33:14.640
is two hours twenty minutes

33:14.640 --> 33:16.809
Temperature is 72 degrees

33:18.811 --> 33:19.812
What was that?

33:19.812 --> 33:21.230
We've got a light on

33:21.230 --> 33:23.023
Could be electrical.  Lose a bus?

33:23.023 --> 33:23.899
Exit light is definately on

33:24.108 --> 33:25.150
We've got a door open

33:25.150 --> 33:26.985
What the hell is
going on back there?

33:26.985 --> 33:28.070
Losing power

33:28.070 --> 33:29.530
Warning light, Engine 2

33:29.530 --> 33:30.614
We're losing air speed

33:30.614 --> 33:31.657
We lost No.2

33:31.657 --> 33:33.408
Pull up! Pull up!

33:37.121 --> 33:39.623
Ok.  Shut that off please

33:42.668 --> 33:44.211
Something's missing

33:44.503 --> 33:46.046
There's no gunshot

33:46.713 --> 33:50.843
Can you play that back, Peter,
from the announcement?

33:52.219 --> 33:54.221
Temperature is 72 degrees

33:56.640 --> 33:58.267
Ok, hold it right there

33:58.267 --> 33:59.726
Can you pull that up?

33:59.726 --> 34:00.853
I'll run a reverse algorithm

34:01.186 --> 34:02.396
Just lose the pilots

34:08.819 --> 34:10.112
Ladies and gentlemen

34:10.112 --> 34:13.072
That is Summer and
Christina, isn't it?

34:13.072 --> 34:15.159
And the door opening

34:20.121 --> 34:20.621
So

34:21.540 --> 34:23.208
How long before the
door opening

34:23.458 --> 34:26.712
and Christina's scream

34:28.714 --> 34:29.882
17 seconds

34:31.550 --> 34:34.636
She held on for 17 seconds

34:34.636 --> 34:36.513
Until he pushed her
out of the plane

34:36.513 --> 34:38.139
Now all we have to do is prove it

34:38.139 --> 34:41.851
Speed, go to Christina's apartment
and do a full profile

34:43.228 --> 34:47.357
What she ate.
How she slept at night

34:47.357 --> 34:49.985
How she made it through the day

34:55.491 --> 34:57.576
Calleigh, back to the airframe

34:57.576 --> 34:58.911
Back to the pilot

34:58.911 --> 35:01.789
I want that bullet

35:02.623 --> 35:05.209
Eric.  Focus on the
number two engine

35:05.209 --> 35:07.836
We still don't know what
brought down that plane

36:16.196 --> 36:17.531
She didn't leave a note

36:17.531 --> 36:19.533
No shrine of personal items

36:19.533 --> 36:22.244
Only enough food to get
the cat through one night

36:22.244 --> 36:23.579
Is that it?

36:23.579 --> 36:26.290
Ah, full refridgerator,
phone calls to return

36:26.290 --> 36:27.958
dry cleaning to pick up and

36:27.958 --> 36:30.502
ISS courier picked up
the day she left

36:30.502 --> 36:31.712
Was she on her meds?

36:31.920 --> 36:33.589
Yeah, she filled her
perscription like clockwork

36:33.589 --> 36:35.257
Which means she
didn't kill herself

36:35.257 --> 36:36.175
That means she was coming home

36:36.175 --> 36:38.510
Calleigh.  The bullet?

36:38.510 --> 36:39.720
There was no bullet

36:39.720 --> 36:41.388
Well, how did the pilot get shot

36:41.680 --> 36:42.806
He didn't

36:49.188 --> 36:50.481
The rivet runs through it

36:50.773 --> 36:52.316
Metal stress during the crash must

36:52.316 --> 36:53.567
have popped the rivet loose

36:53.567 --> 36:55.277
Plane literally ripped itself apart

36:55.277 --> 36:56.904
That's not what bough
the plane down, right?

36:56.904 --> 36:59.698
No actually, the shoe
hit the engine fan

36:59.698 --> 37:03.243
I found a piece of leather
in the number two engine

37:03.243 --> 37:06.330
Let me guess. Red suede.
450 bucks a pair

37:10.584 --> 37:12.419
We don't have the
evidence to nail this guy

37:12.419 --> 37:14.630
We need the proof

37:14.630 --> 37:15.756
Where are you going?

37:16.089 --> 37:19.218
I'm going where we're all going

37:19.510 --> 37:22.513
Back to those seventeen seconds

37:22.805 --> 37:25.390
I'm the largest insurer
in the southeast

37:25.390 --> 37:27.518
But I've been cooking
the books lately

37:27.518 --> 37:29.645
and the SEC wants
to have a sit down

37:29.645 --> 37:32.523
AS senior accountant, I know
where the bodies are buried

37:32.523 --> 37:33.941
But I can't go through with it

37:33.941 --> 37:35.400
And I tell you so

37:35.400 --> 37:36.860
But I'm not gonna let you
take the company down

37:36.860 --> 37:39.196
Cuz It's my life's work

37:39.196 --> 37:40.572
So we argue

37:40.572 --> 37:42.783
I take off my seatbelt
to get away from you

37:42.783 --> 37:44.993
But I don't let you get away
from me that easily so I follow

37:44.993 --> 37:45.869
Just wait

37:45.869 --> 37:47.996
Then it gets physical

37:47.996 --> 37:49.581
I push in into that door

37:49.581 --> 37:51.750
Which flies open when
I grab the handle

37:51.750 --> 37:52.751
No!

38:00.384 --> 38:03.137
And there you are,
hanging on for dear life

38:03.137 --> 38:05.389
And this is my opportunity

38:05.389 --> 38:09.268
For seventeen seconds we struggle
and I push you out of the plane

38:10.561 --> 38:11.854
Which can't be proven because

38:11.854 --> 38:14.606
there's no physical evidence
of an altercation

38:14.606 --> 38:18.694
And our only witness is
Mr. Summer, our suspect

38:20.988 --> 38:22.239
So...

38:23.824 --> 38:25.284
What else would be here?

38:26.743 --> 38:28.203
What else would be here?

38:28.996 --> 38:31.999
We've got the exit,
we've got the handle

38:37.004 --> 38:38.505
The bulkhead

38:41.008 --> 38:42.843
Cockpit door

38:50.559 --> 38:53.812
But what we don't have,
ladies and gentlemen

38:54.021 --> 38:56.690
is the fire extinguisher

39:05.073 --> 39:06.408
Here we go

39:06.867 --> 39:07.701
Here we go

39:20.923 --> 39:23.383
I know what happened on this plane

39:23.383 --> 39:24.718
Get off from me

39:24.968 --> 39:25.969
Get off from me

39:27.554 --> 39:28.639
No! No!

40:21.108 --> 40:22.609
He killed her

40:24.778 --> 40:26.405
But what about the
other passengers?

40:26.613 --> 40:27.865
They would have seen everything

40:27.865 --> 40:29.450
Somebody who nobody on the
plane they're not gonna testify

40:29.450 --> 40:31.118
against and they're on the payroll

40:31.118 --> 40:32.536
It would be against
their own interests

40:32.536 --> 40:34.121
Except the only one
who knew everything

40:34.121 --> 40:36.790
Christina was good at
keeping secrets

40:36.790 --> 40:38.876
Sommer was banking on that

40:38.876 --> 40:41.545
He just didn't bank on her
having a conscience

40:41.795 --> 40:43.088
You okay?

40:43.088 --> 40:46.383
Yeah, I guess I saved
the wrong guy

40:46.383 --> 40:49.178
No such thing brother.
Not here

40:49.470 --> 40:51.513
Right, every man's a prince

40:51.513 --> 40:54.183
That's how we sleep at night

40:58.645 --> 40:59.730
Lieutenant

40:59.980 --> 41:02.733
We found Sommer

41:12.826 --> 41:15.370
He checked himself out

41:24.505 --> 41:27.925
You're really swinging now,
huh Scott

41:33.514 --> 41:35.307
Here you are

41:35.599 --> 41:37.518
How are you holding up?

41:37.810 --> 41:39.061
Good

41:39.311 --> 41:40.521
What's this?

41:40.813 --> 41:43.023
This is a copy of a
report that Christina

41:43.023 --> 41:45.400
sent to the Securities and
Exchange Commission

41:45.651 --> 41:48.237
This is what she was working on

41:48.237 --> 41:49.863
I don't understand

41:49.863 --> 41:52.616
Well, she sent this the
morning she died

41:52.616 --> 41:54.243
Now, Mrs. Calluchi this was

41:54.493 --> 41:57.579
a very difficult decision

42:15.305 --> 42:17.891
But she did the right thing

42:22.104 --> 42:24.648
To whom it may concern

42:26.233 --> 42:29.319
I hope I'm not writing
this letter in vain

42:40.747 --> 42:42.791
To whom it may concern

42:43.250 --> 42:45.794
I hope I'm not writing
this letter in vain

42:49.256 --> 42:51.800
But I feel that I have a
responsibility to those

42:51.800 --> 42:54.052
who depend on us

43:02.186 --> 43:04.938
To those who expect us

43:05.230 --> 43:08.400
to deliver an honest
and fair accounting

43:11.779 --> 43:16.283
I feel a responsibility
to speak the truth

43:26.502 --> 43:28.378
For those innocent victims
who are powerless

43:28.629 --> 43:31.799
to speak it themselves

43:38.764 --> 43:45.521
Because without the truth,
we ourselves become powerless

43:49.817 --> 43:52.361
