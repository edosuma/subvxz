02:08.711 --> 02:12.048
We are quite, quite wrong.

02:16.470 --> 02:19.180
Once upon a time,
there was a charming country house...

02:19.264 --> 02:22.433
in which lived
a very happily married couple.

02:41.078 --> 02:43.663
- Edith, you know the cocktail shaker?
- Yes'm.

02:43.747 --> 02:46.666
Well, I want you to fill two of those
long-stemmed glasses from it...

02:46.750 --> 02:48.459
- and bring them up here.
- Yes'm.

02:48.544 --> 02:50.056
And, Edith, as you're not in the navy,

02:50.057 --> 02:52.046
it's unnecessary to do
everything at the double.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.674
- Very good, ma'am.
- And, Edith, when you're serving dinner...

02:54.758 --> 02:57.718
try to remember to do it
calmly and methodically.

02:57.803 --> 03:00.012
- Yes'm.
- Now go and get the cocktails.

03:00.097 --> 03:02.390
- Yes'm.
- Not at a run, Edith.

03:02.474 --> 03:03.975
Yes'm.

03:04.059 --> 03:06.894
What do you suppose induced Agnes
to leave us and go and get married?

03:07.521 --> 03:10.022
The reason was becoming
increasingly obvious, dear.

03:10.691 --> 03:13.401
Yes. We must keep Edith
in the house more.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.946
- Oh, dear!
- What's the matter?

03:17.030 --> 03:19.365
I have an idea this evening's
going to be awful.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.325
Well, I think it'll be funny,
but not awful.

03:21.410 --> 03:24.203
Why did you ask the Bradmans, darling?
He's as skeptical as we are.

03:24.288 --> 03:26.617
He'll probably say
the most dreadful things.

03:26.618 --> 03:27.707
Well, I warned him.

03:27.791 --> 03:28.859
There had to be more than three of us,

03:28.860 --> 03:30.209
and we couldn't have
the vicar and his wife...

03:30.294 --> 03:32.879
because, A, they're dreary,
and, B, they wouldn't have approved at all.

03:32.963 --> 03:35.715
- No, it had to be the Bradmans.
- You must promise not to catch my eye.

03:35.799 --> 03:38.509
If I giggle - and I'm very likely to -
it will ruin everything.

03:38.594 --> 03:41.888
You mustn't. You must be dead serious,
and if possible, a little intense.

03:41.972 --> 03:44.932
We can't hurt the old girl's feelings,
however funny she is.

04:01.825 --> 04:03.784
That was her.

04:03.869 --> 04:06.871
Oh, that's her, is it?
I've seen her in the village several times.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.748
She certainly is a strange woman.

04:08.832 --> 04:11.250
The vicar told me he saw her
up on the knoll on Midsummer Eve...

04:11.335 --> 04:13.252
dressed in sort of Indian robes.

04:13.337 --> 04:15.713
Apparently, she's been a professional
in London for years.

04:15.797 --> 04:19.091
It's funny, isn't it? I mean, to think
of people doing it as a profession.

04:19.176 --> 04:20.968
Hmm. I believe it's very lucrative.

04:21.053 --> 04:23.054
What does Mr. Condomine hope
to get out of her?

04:23.138 --> 04:25.681
Material for his book.
He's writing a mystery story, you know.

04:27.351 --> 04:30.686
- To The Unseen.
- I must say that's a wonderful title.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.981
If this evening's a success, I shall start
writing the first draft tomorrow.

04:34.066 --> 04:37.610
Used Elvira to be a help to you - when you
were thinking something out, I mean?

04:37.694 --> 04:39.487
Poor Elvira.

04:39.571 --> 04:43.491
If I died before you'd grown tired of me,
I wonder if you'd forget me so soon.

04:43.575 --> 04:46.619
- What a horrible thing to say.
- No, I think it's interesting.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.704
Well, to begin with,
I haven't forgotten Elvira.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.706
I remember her very distinctly indeed.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.376
I remember how fascinating she was
and how maddening.

04:53.460 --> 04:56.379
I remember her gay charm when she had
achieved her own way over something...

04:56.463 --> 04:59.048
and her extreme acidity when she didn't.

04:59.132 --> 05:02.051
I remember her physical attractiveness,
which was tremendous...

05:02.135 --> 05:05.304
and her spiritual integrity, which was nil.

05:05.389 --> 05:08.140
Was she more physically attractive
than I am?

05:08.225 --> 05:11.811
That's a very tiresome question, darling,
and fully deserves the wrong answer.

05:11.895 --> 05:14.271
- You really are very sweet.
- Thank you.

05:14.356 --> 05:16.816
- And a little naive too.
- Why?

05:16.900 --> 05:22.154
Because you imagine that I mind about Elvira
being more physically attractive than I am.

05:22.239 --> 05:23.990
I love you, my love.

05:24.074 --> 05:27.785
I know you do, but not the wildest stretch
of the imagination could describe it...

05:27.869 --> 05:29.996
as the first fine, careless rapture.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.498
- Would you like it to be?
- Good heavens, no.

05:32.582 --> 05:34.291
Wasn't that a shade too vehement?

05:34.376 --> 05:36.168
We're neither of us adolescent, Charles.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.295
We've neither of us
led exactly prim lives, have we?

05:38.380 --> 05:39.839
We've both been married before.

05:39.923 --> 05:43.009
Careless rapture at this stage
would be incongruous and embarrassing.

05:43.093 --> 05:45.094
I hope I haven't been
in any way a disappointment, dear.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.138
Don't be so idiotic.

05:47.222 --> 05:49.223
After all, your first husband
was a great deal older than you.

05:49.307 --> 05:51.434
I wouldn't like you to think
that you've missed out all along the line.

05:51.518 --> 05:54.186
There are moments, Charles,
when you go too far.

05:54.271 --> 05:56.439
Sorry, darling.

05:58.567 --> 06:02.945
If I died, I wonder how long it would be
before you married again.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.364
You won't die.
You're not the dying sort.

06:05.449 --> 06:08.117
- Neither was Elvira.
- Oh, yes, she was, now I come to think of it.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.786
She had a certain ethereal,
not-quite-of-this-world quality.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.080
Nobody would call you
even remotely ethereal.

06:13.165 --> 06:15.166
Nonsense.
She was of the earth - earthy.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.959
Yes. Well, she is now anyhow.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.378
You know, that's the kind of observation
that shocks people.

06:19.463 --> 06:22.882
It's discouraging to think how many people
are shocked by honesty and how few by deceit.

06:22.966 --> 06:24.967
Write that down.
You might forget it.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.552
You underrate me.

06:26.636 --> 06:29.305
Anyhow, it was a question of bad taste
more than honesty.

06:30.348 --> 06:32.975
I was devoted to Elvira.
We were married five years.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.977
She died. I missed her very much.

06:35.062 --> 06:37.980
That was seven years ago
and I've now, with your help, my love...

06:38.065 --> 06:39.899
risen above the whole thing.

06:39.983 --> 06:41.650
That's probably the Bradmans.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.736
It might be Madame Arcati.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.742
Shall I go,
or shall we let Edith have her fling?

06:49.826 --> 06:52.078
She's probably on one knee
in a pre-sprinting position...

06:52.162 --> 06:54.288
waiting for Cook
to open the kitchen door.

06:55.791 --> 06:57.708
- Steady, Edith.
- Yes, sir.

07:01.838 --> 07:02.330
Good evening.

07:02.331 --> 07:04.924
We're not late, are we? I only got
back from the hospital half an hour ago.

07:05.008 --> 07:06.592
Of course not.
Madame Arcati isn't here yet.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.511
No, we passed her
coming up the hill on her bicycle.

07:08.637 --> 07:09.992
I'm so glad you were able to come.

07:09.993 --> 07:12.515
We've been looking forward to it.
I feel really quite excited.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.850
I guarantee that Violet will be good.
I made her promise.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.103
Fine. Come and have a drink.

07:17.187 --> 07:18.729
Oh, thank you so much.

07:18.855 --> 07:20.169
Do you believe in it, Mrs. Condomine?

07:20.170 --> 07:22.441
Do you think there's anything
really genuine about it at all?

07:22.526 --> 07:25.236
I'm afraid not. But I do think
it's interesting how easily -

07:25.320 --> 07:26.946
- Thank you.
- People allow themselves to be deceived.

07:27.030 --> 07:28.632
But she must believe
it herself, mustn't she?

07:28.633 --> 07:29.782
Or is the whole business a fake?

07:29.866 --> 07:32.701
I suspect the worst.
A real professional charlatan.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.453
That's what I'm hoping for anyhow.

07:34.538 --> 07:36.997
The character that I'm planning for my book
must be a complete impostor.

07:37.082 --> 07:39.250
It's one of the most important factors
of the whole story.

07:39.334 --> 07:42.128
Do you think she tells fortunes?
I love having my fortune told.

07:42.254 --> 07:42.979
Yes, I expect so.

07:42.980 --> 07:45.422
- Have you ever attended her,
Doctor? Professionally, I mean?

07:45.507 --> 07:47.731
Oh, yes. She had influenza last January.

07:47.766 --> 07:49.301
She's only been here just
over a year, you know.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.137
Here she is.

07:51.221 --> 07:53.410
I say, she knows, doesn't
she, about tonight?

07:53.445 --> 07:54.223
You're not going to spring it on her?

07:54.307 --> 07:56.308
No, of course not.
It was all arranged last week.

07:56.393 --> 07:59.395
I told her how profoundly interested I was,
and she blossomed like a rose.

07:59.479 --> 08:02.273
I really feel quite nervous,
as if I were going to make a speech.

08:02.357 --> 08:04.525
- Go and meet her, darling.
- Mmm.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.832
- Oh, good evening.
- Hmm?

08:21.209 --> 08:23.669
I've leant my bike up
against that little bush out there.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.713
It'll be perfectly all right
if no one touches it.

08:25.797 --> 08:28.174
- How nice to see you, Madame Arcati.
- My dear Madame Arcati.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.467
I'm afraid I'm rather late,
but I had a sudden presentiment...

08:30.552 --> 08:33.261
that I was going to have a puncture,
so I went back to fetch my pump.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.347
And then, of course,
I didn't have a puncture at all.

08:35.432 --> 08:37.308
Perhaps you will on the way home.

08:37.392 --> 08:38.683
Oh, thank you.

08:38.768 --> 08:41.729
- You know -
- Dr. Bradman, the man with the gentle hands.

08:41.813 --> 08:44.106
I'm delighted to see you looking so well.
This is my wife.

08:44.191 --> 08:44.721
How do you do?

08:44.722 --> 08:46.442
- We're old friends. We
meet coming out of shops.

08:46.526 --> 08:47.762
Would you like a cocktail?

08:47.763 --> 08:50.321
- If it's a dry martini, yes.
If it's a concoction, no.

08:50.405 --> 08:52.907
Experience has taught me
to be very wary of concoctions.

08:52.991 --> 08:54.783
- It is a dry martini.
- How delicious.

08:55.577 --> 08:58.162
We do so much appreciate
your coming all this way, Madame Arcati.

08:58.246 --> 09:01.123
Oh, nonsense. It was wonderful cycling
through the woods this evening.

09:01.208 --> 09:04.251
- I was deafened with birdsong.
- It's been lovely all day.

09:04.336 --> 09:06.921
Ah, but the evening's the time.
Mark my words.

09:07.005 --> 09:08.547
Thank you.

09:08.632 --> 09:10.299
Cheers! Cheers!

09:12.010 --> 09:14.637
Don't you find it tiring
bicycling everywhere?

09:14.721 --> 09:18.015
On the contrary, it stimulates me.
I was getting far too sedentary in London.

09:18.099 --> 09:20.226
That horrid little flat with the dim lights.

09:20.310 --> 09:22.853
They had to be dim, you know.
The clients expect it.

09:22.938 --> 09:25.022
This is the best dry martini
I've had for years.

09:25.106 --> 09:27.024
- Would you like another?
- Certainly.

09:31.780 --> 09:35.241
I must say,
I find bicycling very exhausting.

09:35.325 --> 09:36.825
Steady rhythm - that's what does it.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.998
Once you get the knack of it,
you need never look back.

09:38.999 --> 09:40.079
On you get, and away you go.

09:40.163 --> 09:43.249
But the hills, Madame Arcati.
Pushing up those awful hills.

09:43.333 --> 09:45.167
Just knack again.

09:45.252 --> 09:48.921
Down with your head, up with your heart,
and you're over the top like a flash...

09:49.005 --> 09:52.424
and skimming down the other side
like a dragonfly.

09:54.803 --> 09:57.680
- Dinner is served, ma'am.
- Thank you, Edith.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.765
Oh, no red meat, I hope.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.725
There's meat,
but I don't think it will be very red.

10:01.810 --> 10:05.104
I make it a rule
never to eat red meat before I work.

10:12.862 --> 10:14.697
Would you rather have an egg
or something?

10:14.781 --> 10:17.157
Oh, no, thank you. We'll risk it.

10:17.242 --> 10:19.493
It's just that it sometimes
has an odd effect.

10:19.577 --> 10:22.538
- What sort of effect?
- Nothing of the least importance.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.081
Thank you.

10:24.165 --> 10:27.710
How do you get in touch with people
on the other side, Madame Arcati?

10:27.794 --> 10:30.504
Through a control, of course.
In my case, a little girl.

10:30.588 --> 10:32.089
They're generally the best.

10:32.173 --> 10:33.781
Some mediums prefer Indians, of course,

10:33.782 --> 10:35.884
but personally I've always
found them unreliable.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.803
In what way unreliable?

10:37.887 --> 10:39.972
Well, to start with,
they're frightfully lazy.

10:40.056 --> 10:42.141
Also, when faced with
any sort of difficulty...

10:42.225 --> 10:45.936
they're apt to go off into their own tribal
language, which is naturally unintelligible.

10:46.021 --> 10:48.480
That generally spoils everything
and wastes a good deal of time.

10:48.565 --> 10:51.275
Do you feel funny
when you go off into a trance?

10:51.359 --> 10:52.651
In what way "funny"?

10:53.403 --> 10:56.030
I don't think Mrs. Bradman means funny
in its comic implication.

10:56.114 --> 10:58.157
I think she meant strange or odd.

10:58.241 --> 11:00.617
The word was an unfortunate choice.

11:01.328 --> 11:02.953
Oh, I'm sure I'm very sorry.

11:03.038 --> 11:06.832
It doesn't matter in the least.
Please don't apologize.

11:06.916 --> 11:09.668
When did you first discover
that you had these remarkable powers?

11:09.753 --> 11:11.003
When I was quite tiny.

11:11.087 --> 11:13.005
My mother was a medium before me,
you see...

11:13.089 --> 11:16.467
and so I had every opportunity of starting
on the ground floor, as you might say.

11:16.551 --> 11:18.886
I had my first trance
when I was four years old...

11:18.970 --> 11:21.805
and my first ectoplasmic manifestation
when I was five and a half.

11:21.890 --> 11:25.601
Oh! What an exciting day that was.
I shall never forget it.

11:25.685 --> 11:29.521
Of course, the manifestation
was quite small and of very short duration...

11:29.606 --> 11:32.566
but for a child of my tender years,
it was most gratifying.

11:33.568 --> 11:36.028
- Can you tell fortunes?
- Certainly not.

11:36.112 --> 11:39.114
I disapprove of fortune tellers
most strongly.

11:44.996 --> 11:49.208
Edith, we don't want to be disturbed for
the next hour or so for any reason whatsoever.

11:49.292 --> 11:50.876
- Is that clear?
- Yes'm.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.711
Unless it's an urgent call for George.

11:52.796 --> 11:55.422
- Unless it's an urgent call for Dr. Bradman.
- Yes'm.

11:56.257 --> 11:58.509
Well, Madame Arcati,
the time is drawing near.

11:58.593 --> 12:01.387
- Who knows? It may be receding.
- How very true.

12:01.471 --> 12:03.389
I hope you feel in the mood, Madame Arcati.

12:03.473 --> 12:06.433
Well, it isn't a question of mood.
It's a question of concentration.

12:06.518 --> 12:08.310
You must forgive us being so impatient.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.646
We can easily wait
if you're not quite ready to start.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.898
No, nonsense, my dear.
I'm absolutely ready.

12:12.982 --> 12:14.900
Heigh-ho! Heigh-ho!
To work we go.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.819
- Is there anything you'd like us to do?
- Do?

12:16.903 --> 12:18.821
Well, sort of hold hands or anything.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.353
All that will come later.

12:20.354 --> 12:23.075
First, a few deep, deep
breaths of fresh air.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.416
You may talk, if you wish.
It won't disturb me in the least.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.923
Shh! It was an excellent dinner, darling.

12:38.007 --> 12:40.676
- I congratulate you.
- The mousse wasn't quite right.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.928
It looked a bit hysterical,
but it tasted delicious.

12:43.012 --> 12:46.014
- That cuckoo's very angry.
- I beg your pardon.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.767
I said that cuckoo is very angry.
Listen!

12:51.020 --> 12:53.397
- How do you know?
- Timbre.

12:56.609 --> 12:59.111
No moon. That's as well, I think.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.155
A mist rising from the marshes.

13:01.239 --> 13:03.490
There's no need for me
to light my bicycle lamp, is there?

13:03.575 --> 13:07.119
- I mean, no one's likely to fall over it.
- No. We're not expecting anyone else.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.704
Splendid.

13:09.664 --> 13:11.582
Good night, you foolish bird.

13:13.710 --> 13:16.462
- You have a table?
- Well, we rather thought that one might do.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.801
I think the one there would be better.

13:22.886 --> 13:25.345
Over here, Mr. Condomine, please.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.097
Hmm.

13:29.517 --> 13:31.768
This is a moment that I always hate.

13:34.063 --> 13:35.731
- Are you nervous?
- Yes.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.663
- When I was a girl, I
always used to be sick.

13:37.664 --> 13:39.276
- How fortunate that
you grew out of it.

13:42.197 --> 13:44.487
Children are always much
more prone to be sick...

13:44.488 --> 13:46.241
than grown-ups though, aren't they?

13:46.326 --> 13:48.389
Little Tommy Tucker
sings for his supper.

13:48.424 --> 13:50.412
What shall he have but
brown bread and butter?

13:50.497 --> 13:53.369
I despise that because
it doesn't rhyme at all,

13:53.370 --> 13:54.625
but Daphne loves it.

13:54.709 --> 13:56.293
Who's Daphne?

13:56.377 --> 13:59.296
Daphne is Madame Arcati's control.
She's the little girl.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.798
Oh, yes. Yes, of course. I see.
How old is she?

14:01.883 --> 14:04.718
- Rising seven when she died.
- And when was that?

14:04.802 --> 14:06.845
February the sixth, 1884.

14:06.930 --> 14:10.015
She must be a bit long in the tooth
by now, I should think.

14:10.099 --> 14:13.852
You should think, Dr. Bradman, but I fear
you don't, at least not profoundly enough.

14:13.937 --> 14:17.147
Please forgive me, Madame Arcati.
I assure you I'm deeply interested.

14:17.232 --> 14:19.024
It's of no consequence.

14:19.108 --> 14:21.299
Now, will you all sit
round the table, please,

14:21.300 --> 14:23.070
and place your hands downwards on it?

14:23.154 --> 14:25.864
- Come, Mrs. Bradman.
- What about the lights?

14:25.949 --> 14:28.784
All in good time, Mr. Condomine.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.078
Now sit down, please.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.877
That's better.
I presume that's the gramophone.

14:38.962 --> 14:41.213
Would you like me to start it for you?
It's an electric one.

14:41.297 --> 14:43.757
No, no. Please stay where you are.
I can manage.

14:46.052 --> 14:49.137
Now, what have we here?
Brahms. Oh, dear me, no.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.306
Rachmaninoff - too florid.

14:51.391 --> 14:54.476
- Where's the dance music?
- They're the loose ones on the left.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.562
I'm afraid none of them are very new.

14:56.646 --> 15:00.274
Daphne's really more attached
to Irving Berlin than to anyone else.

15:00.358 --> 15:03.777
She likes a tune she can hum.
Oh, here's one - "Always. "

15:04.654 --> 15:06.780
- "Always"?
- What's the matter?

15:06.864 --> 15:08.949
Uh - Nothing, darling. Nothing at all.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.836
Now, there are one or two things
that I would like to explain,

15:12.837 --> 15:14.079
so will you all listen attentively?

15:14.163 --> 15:15.122
Of course.

15:15.206 --> 15:18.458
Presently, when the music begins,
I'm going to switch out the lights.

15:18.543 --> 15:22.671
I may then either walk about the room
for a little or lie down flat.

15:22.755 --> 15:26.300
In due course, I shall draw up
that dear little stool and join you at the table.

15:26.384 --> 15:28.844
I shall place myself
between you and your wife, Dr. Bradman...

15:28.928 --> 15:30.929
and rest my hands lightly upon yours.

15:31.014 --> 15:34.558
I must ask you not to address me or move
or do anything in the least distracting.

15:34.642 --> 15:36.602
- Is that quite, quite clear?
- Perfectly.

15:36.686 --> 15:39.313
Of course, I can't guarantee
that anything will happen at all.

15:39.397 --> 15:41.064
Daphne may be unavailable.

15:41.149 --> 15:44.276
She had a head cold recently
and was rather under the weather, poor child.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.570
On the other hand,
a great many things might occur.

15:46.654 --> 15:49.948
One of you might have an emanation,
for instance.

15:50.033 --> 15:54.036
Or we might contact a poltergeist, which
would be extremely destructive and noisy.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.872
- In what way destructive?
- They throw things, you know.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.290
No, I didn't know.

15:58.374 --> 16:01.001
Now, are you ready to empty your minds?

16:01.085 --> 16:03.253
Do you mean you want us
to try and think of nothing?

16:03.338 --> 16:05.047
Absolutely nothing, Dr. Bradman.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.841
Concentrate on a space
or on a nondescript color.

16:07.925 --> 16:10.260
- That's really the better way.
- I'll do my level best.

16:10.345 --> 16:12.012
Good work!

16:50.927 --> 16:52.427
Lights!

16:54.555 --> 16:56.056
Oh, dear!

17:15.451 --> 17:19.413
Is there anyone there?

17:19.497 --> 17:23.541
One rap for yes. Two raps for no.

17:23.626 --> 17:25.377
Is there anyone there?

17:26.212 --> 17:27.753
Oh!

17:27.839 --> 17:29.798
Is that you, Daphne?

17:31.300 --> 17:33.260
Is your cold better, dear?

17:35.138 --> 17:37.723
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Are you doing anything for it?

17:37.807 --> 17:40.517
I'm afraid she's very fretful.

17:41.978 --> 17:45.063
Is there anyone there
who wishes to speak to anyone here?

17:46.315 --> 17:49.401
Ah. Now we're getting somewhere.
Oh, no, Daphne. Don't do that, dear.

17:49.485 --> 17:52.279
You're hurting me.
Daphne dear, please!

17:52.363 --> 17:54.990
Oh, be good. There's a dear child.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.908
I'm sorry.

17:56.993 --> 18:00.245
You say there's someone there
who wishes to speak to someone here?

18:01.831 --> 18:03.331
Is it me?

18:06.210 --> 18:08.170
Is it Dr. Bradman?

18:10.006 --> 18:12.007
Is it Mrs. Bradman?

18:13.676 --> 18:15.844
Is it Mrs. Condomine?

18:16.846 --> 18:19.639
Oh, stop it, Daphne. Behave yourself.

18:19.724 --> 18:21.683
Is it Mr. Condomine?

18:24.687 --> 18:27.189
There's someone who wishes
to speak to you, Mr. Condomine.

18:27.273 --> 18:30.275
Tell them to leave a message.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.652
I really must ask you not to be flippant,
Mr. Condomine.

18:34.363 --> 18:36.990
Charles, how can you be so idiotic?
You'll spoil everything.

18:37.074 --> 18:39.034
I'm sorry. It just slipped out.

18:40.036 --> 18:42.412
Do you know anyone
who's passed over recently?

18:42.497 --> 18:44.206
Not recently,
except my cousin in the civil service...

18:44.290 --> 18:46.291
and he wouldn't be likely
to want to communicate with me.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.043
We haven't spoken for years.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.504
Are you Mr. Condomine's cousin
in the civil service?

18:50.588 --> 18:53.548
No, I'm afraid we've drawn a blank.

18:53.633 --> 18:56.551
Try and think of someone else.
Rack your brains.

18:58.221 --> 19:01.014
It might be old Mrs. Plummett, you know.
She died on Whit Monday.

19:01.098 --> 19:03.725
I can't imagine why old Mrs. Plummett
should wish to speak to me.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.978
- We had very little in common.
- It's worth trying.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.816
Are you old Mrs. Plummett?

19:12.235 --> 19:14.319
She was deaf.
Perhaps you'd better shout.

19:15.238 --> 19:17.364
Are you old Mrs. Plummett?

19:21.619 --> 19:24.329
No, there's nobody there at all.

19:24.413 --> 19:27.082
How disappointing.
Just as we were getting on so nicely.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.834
Violet, be quiet.

19:28.918 --> 19:31.419
Well, I'm afraid there's nothing for it
but for me to go into a trance.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.839
Excuse me a moment
while I start the gramophone again.

19:33.923 --> 19:36.383
- Not "Always. " Don't play "Always. "
- I'm afraid I must.

19:36.467 --> 19:40.303
It would be imprudent to change horses
in midstream, if you know what I mean.

19:40.388 --> 19:42.389
Oh, well. Have it your own way.

20:19.135 --> 20:24.431
Little Tommy Tucker sings for his supper.

20:24.515 --> 20:27.726
What shall we give him...

20:27.810 --> 20:31.021
but brown bread and butter?

20:31.105 --> 20:33.231
That would be Daphne.
She ought to have had her adenoids out.

20:33.316 --> 20:35.901
George, please!

20:36.485 --> 20:38.445
- Good heavens.
- Shh!

20:40.656 --> 20:42.657
It's trying to get away.
I can't hold it.

20:44.035 --> 20:46.036
Press down hard.

20:48.831 --> 20:50.957
Ought we to pick it up
or leave it where it is?

20:51.042 --> 20:53.418
- How the devil should I know?
- Well, there's no need to snap at me.

20:53.502 --> 20:56.504
- I suppose we'd better pick it up.
- Leave it where it is.

20:57.840 --> 21:00.926
- Who said that?
- Who said what?

21:01.010 --> 21:03.595
- Somebody said, "Leave it where it is. "
- Nonsense, dear.

21:03.679 --> 21:06.097
- I heard it distinctly.
- Nobody else did, did they?

21:06.182 --> 21:07.933
I never heard a sound.

21:08.017 --> 21:09.559
It was you, Ruth.
You're playing tricks.

21:09.644 --> 21:11.853
I'm doing nothing of the sort.
I haven't uttered.

21:11.938 --> 21:14.147
Good evening, Charles.

21:16.025 --> 21:17.984
Ventriloquism.
That's what it is - ventriloquism.

21:18.069 --> 21:20.695
- What's the matter with you?
- You must have heard that.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.948
- One of you must have heard that.
- Heard what?

21:23.032 --> 21:26.034
You mean to sit there solemnly and tell me
that none of you heard anything at all?

21:26.118 --> 21:28.119
- I certainly didn't.
- Neither did I. I wish I had.

21:28.204 --> 21:29.871
I should love to hear something.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.554
It's you who are playing
the tricks, Charles.

21:31.555 --> 21:32.874
You're acting to try and frighten us.

21:32.959 --> 21:34.459
I'm not. I swear I'm not.

21:34.543 --> 21:37.128
It's difficult to think of what to say
after seven years...

21:37.213 --> 21:40.632
but I suppose that "good evening"
is as good as anything else.

21:40.716 --> 21:45.095
- Who are you?
- Elvira, of course. Don't be so silly.

21:45.179 --> 21:47.889
I can't bear this another minute.
Get up, everybody. The entertainment's over.

21:50.101 --> 21:51.214
Charles, how tiresome of you.

21:51.215 --> 21:53.019
Just as we were beginning
to enjoy ourselves.

21:53.104 --> 21:55.981
Never again. That's all I can say.
Never, never again, as long as I live.

21:56.065 --> 21:58.483
Did you hear something
we didn't hear, really?

21:58.567 --> 22:01.569
- No, of course not. I was only pretending.
- I knew you were.

22:01.654 --> 22:04.072
Oh, dear! Look at Madame Arcati.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.492
- What are we to do with her?
- Bring her round.

22:07.576 --> 22:10.495
Bring her round as soon as possible.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.584
She's out, all right.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.461
Bring her round.
It's dangerous to leave her like this.

22:18.546 --> 22:21.089
Really, Charles,
you're behaving most peculiarly.

22:21.173 --> 22:23.049
Madame Arcati, wake up!
Time to go home!

22:23.134 --> 22:25.176
- Now steady, steady on.
- Get some brandy. Give her some brandy.

22:25.261 --> 22:27.721
What on earth is the matter with you?

22:27.805 --> 22:29.514
Get some brandy!

22:30.099 --> 22:32.434
Here, Bradman, give me a - Help me.
I'll take the feet.

22:32.518 --> 22:34.436
Lift her into the chair.

22:38.524 --> 22:40.358
Wake up, Madame Arcati.

22:40.443 --> 22:42.777
Little Tommy Tucker, Madame Arcati!

22:44.196 --> 22:46.114
Here's the brandy.

22:50.453 --> 22:51.953
She's coming round.

22:52.038 --> 22:54.539
Be careful, Charles.
You're spilling it down her dress.

22:58.836 --> 23:00.170
Well, that's that.

23:00.254 --> 23:02.756
- Are you all right?
- Certainly I am, my dear.

23:02.840 --> 23:05.341
I never felt better in my life.

23:05.426 --> 23:07.385
Well, what happened?
Was it satisfactory?

23:07.470 --> 23:10.180
Oh, nothing much happened, Madame Arcati,
after you went off.

23:13.100 --> 23:15.643
No, something happened, all right.
I can feel it.

23:22.068 --> 23:24.235
No poltergeists at any rate.
That's a good thing.

23:24.320 --> 23:26.321
- Any apparitions?
- Not a thing.

23:28.657 --> 23:30.325
What, no ectoplasm?

23:30.409 --> 23:33.495
I'm not quite sure what that is,
but I don't think so.

23:34.914 --> 23:38.083
Curious. I feel as if something tremendous
had taken place.

23:38.167 --> 23:41.252
Charles pretended he heard a voice
to try and frighten us.

23:41.337 --> 23:42.921
It was only a joke.

23:43.005 --> 23:45.090
A poor one, if I may say so.

23:45.216 --> 23:46.687
Nevertheless, I'm prepared to swear that...

23:46.688 --> 23:48.968
there's someone else psychic
in this room apart from myself.

23:49.053 --> 23:51.054
I don't really see how there could be,
Madame Arcati.

23:51.138 --> 23:53.431
I do hope I haven't gone
and released something.

23:53.516 --> 23:55.642
However, we are bound to find out
within a day or two.

23:55.726 --> 23:58.812
If any manifestations should occur
or you hear any unexpected noises...

23:58.896 --> 24:00.396
you might let me know at once.

24:00.481 --> 24:02.857
Oh, of course we will.
We'll get in touch with you immediately.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.556
- Well, I really think
I must be on my way now.

24:04.557 --> 24:06.069
- Wouldn't you like
something before you go?

24:06.153 --> 24:09.114
Oh, no, thank you. I have some Ovaltine
all ready in a saucepan at home.

24:09.198 --> 24:11.616
It only needs hotting up.
Good-bye, Mrs. Condomine.

24:11.700 --> 24:13.409
It was sweet of you
to take all this trouble.

24:13.494 --> 24:16.454
Well, I'm so sorry so little occurred.
It's that cold of Daphne's, I expect.

24:16.539 --> 24:18.957
You know what children are
when there's anything wrong with them.

24:19.041 --> 24:21.918
- We must try again some other evening.
- That would be lovely.

24:22.002 --> 24:24.129
- Good night, Mrs. Bradman.
- It was thrilling. It really was.

24:24.213 --> 24:26.798
I felt the table absolutely shaking
under my hands.

24:26.882 --> 24:29.134
- Good night, Doctor.
- Congratulations, Madame Arcati.

24:29.218 --> 24:32.095
I'm fully aware of the irony
in your voice, Dr. Bradman.

24:32.179 --> 24:35.473
As a matter of fact, you'd make
an excellent subject for telepathic hypnosis.

24:35.558 --> 24:38.726
A great chum of mine's an expert.
I'd like her to look you over.

24:38.811 --> 24:41.146
I'm sure I should be charmed.

24:41.230 --> 24:42.856
- Well, good night, everyone.
- Good night.

24:42.940 --> 24:44.607
Good night.

24:45.526 --> 24:49.154
Thank you. Next time we must really
put our backs into it.

24:49.238 --> 24:50.572
Good night.

24:56.162 --> 24:58.454
Be careful, Mrs. Condomine.
She might hear you.

24:58.539 --> 25:01.416
I can't help it.
I've been holding this in for ages.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.168
But do you really think she believes -

25:03.252 --> 25:05.336
Of course not.
The whole thing's a put-up job.

25:05.421 --> 25:08.798
I must say, though, she shoots a more
original line than they generally do.

25:10.050 --> 25:13.178
I hope Mr. Condomine got
all the atmosphere he wanted for his book.

25:13.262 --> 25:16.264
He would have got a great deal more
if he hadn't spoiled it by showing off.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.349
I'm really very cross with him.

25:28.777 --> 25:31.446
I suddenly felt a draft.
There must be a window open.

25:31.530 --> 25:32.864
No, they're shut.

25:32.948 --> 25:36.367
Perhaps it was one of those whatchamacallims
Madame Arcati was talking about.

25:36.452 --> 25:38.453
- Elementals?
- No, it couldn't be.

25:38.537 --> 25:41.331
She distinctly said it was the wrong time
of the year for elementals.

25:44.585 --> 25:47.503
Well, the old girl went pedaling off
down the drive at a hell of a speed.

25:47.588 --> 25:50.131
- We had a bit of trouble lighting her lamp.
- Poor thing.

25:50.216 --> 25:52.133
I've got a theory about her, you know.

25:52.218 --> 25:55.887
- I believe she's completely sincere.
- Charles, how could she be?

25:55.971 --> 25:56.889
Well, we must be going.

25:56.890 --> 25:58.765
I've got to get up
abominably early tomorrow.

25:58.849 --> 26:00.558
I have a patient being operated on
in Canterbury.

26:00.643 --> 26:02.936
It's been a thrilling evening.
I shall never forget it.

26:03.020 --> 26:04.347
It was sweet of you to include us.

26:04.348 --> 26:06.189
- Good night, Mrs.
Condomine. Thank you so much.

26:06.273 --> 26:07.687
- Are you sure you won't
have a drink before you go?

26:07.712 --> 26:08.733
Quite sure, thanks.

26:08.817 --> 26:10.711
I must do a little reading
up on the whole business,

26:10.712 --> 26:11.569
just for the fun of it.

26:11.654 --> 26:14.322
We'll let you know if we find
any poltergeists whirling about.

26:14.406 --> 26:17.158
- I should never forgive you if you didn't.
- Come along, darling.

26:38.847 --> 26:41.099
- Well, darling?
- Well?

26:41.183 --> 26:43.601
Would you say
the evening had been profitable?

26:43.686 --> 26:45.270
Mmm. I suppose so.

26:45.354 --> 26:47.355
- What's the matter?
- Matter?

26:47.439 --> 26:49.691
Yes. You seem odd somehow.

26:49.775 --> 26:52.610
- Do you feel quite well?
- Mmm, fine.

26:52.695 --> 26:54.248
- I think I'll have a
drink. Do you want one?

26:54.308 --> 26:55.863
No, thank you, dear.

27:03.205 --> 27:05.331
Brr! It's getting very chilly -

27:07.167 --> 27:08.126
Oh, my God!

27:08.210 --> 27:09.210
Charles!

27:11.380 --> 27:13.715
That was very clumsy, Charles dear.

27:20.306 --> 27:22.473
Elvira, then it's true.
It - It was you.

27:22.558 --> 27:23.891
Of course it was.

27:23.976 --> 27:27.312
Charles, darling.
Charles, what are you talking about?

27:27.396 --> 27:29.731
Are you a - a ghost?

27:29.815 --> 27:31.482
I suppose I must be.

27:31.567 --> 27:33.985
It's all very confusing.

27:34.069 --> 27:37.822
What do you keep looking over there for?
Look at me. What's happened?

27:37.906 --> 27:40.074
- Don't you see?
- See what?

27:40.909 --> 27:42.410
Elvira.

27:42.953 --> 27:45.621
- Elvira?
- Yes.

27:46.582 --> 27:49.876
Elvira dear, this is Ruth.
Ruth, this is Elvira.

27:52.129 --> 27:54.630
Come and sit down, darling.

27:54.715 --> 27:57.008
What, do you mean to say
you can't see her?

27:57.092 --> 28:00.720
Look, Charles, you just sit down quietly
by the fire, and I'll fix you another drink.

28:00.804 --> 28:03.806
Don't worry about the mess on the carpet.
Edith can clean that up in the morning.

28:03.891 --> 28:05.377
But you must be able to see her.

28:05.378 --> 28:07.560
She's here. Look. Right
in front of you here.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.730
Look, Charles, if this is a joke,
it's gone far enough.

28:10.814 --> 28:13.608
- Now sit down and don't be idiotic.
- What am I to do?

28:13.692 --> 28:15.651
What the devil am I to do?

28:15.736 --> 28:18.321
Well, I really think you might be
a little more pleased to see me.

28:18.405 --> 28:19.947
After all, you conjured me up.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.657
I didn't do any such thing.

28:21.742 --> 28:23.368
Nonsense. Of course you did.

28:23.452 --> 28:27.705
That awful child with the cold came and told me
that you wanted to see me urgently.

28:27.790 --> 28:29.874
It was all a mistake, a horrible mistake.

28:29.958 --> 28:31.678
Stop talking like that, Charles.

28:31.679 --> 28:34.420
As I told you before, the
joke's gone far enough.

28:34.505 --> 28:36.214
I've gone mad. That's what it is.

28:36.298 --> 28:38.216
I've just gone raving mad.

28:38.300 --> 28:40.218
Now sit down.

28:40.302 --> 28:42.887
Why are you so anxious for me to sit down?
What good will that do?

28:42.971 --> 28:46.224
I want you to relax.
You can't relax standing up.

28:46.308 --> 28:49.894
African natives can.
They can stand on one leg for hours.

28:49.978 --> 28:51.896
I don't happen to be an African native.

28:54.817 --> 28:58.236
- You don't happen to be a what?
- An African native.

28:59.321 --> 29:01.572
What's that got to do with it?

29:01.657 --> 29:03.574
It doesn't matter, Ruth.
It really doesn't matter.

29:03.659 --> 29:05.660
We will say no more about it.

29:05.744 --> 29:08.246
- Look. I've sat down.
- Here. Drink this.

29:11.083 --> 29:13.668
- Would you like some more?
- Yes, please.

29:13.752 --> 29:16.254
Very unwise.
You always had a weak head.

29:16.338 --> 29:18.256
I could drink you under the table.

29:18.340 --> 29:22.093
There's no need to be aggressive, Charles.
I'm doing my best to help you.

29:22.177 --> 29:23.928
Sorry.

29:24.012 --> 29:26.556
Now, drink this, and then
we can go upstairs to bed.

29:26.640 --> 29:28.766
Get rid of her, Charles.
Then we can talk in peace.

29:28.851 --> 29:31.936
That's a thoroughly immoral suggestion.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

29:32.020 --> 29:33.646
What is there immoral in that?

29:33.730 --> 29:36.274
- I wasn't talking to you, Ruth.
- Who were you talking to then?

29:36.358 --> 29:38.860
- Elvira, of course.
- Oh, to blazes with Elvira!

29:38.944 --> 29:41.362
- There now. She's getting cross.
- I don't blame her.

29:41.447 --> 29:44.615
Now look here, Charles. I gather you've
got some sort of plan behind all this.

29:44.700 --> 29:48.202
- I'm not quite a fool.
- Ruth, Elvira is here.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.204
She's standing a few yards away from you.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.623
Yes, dear. I can see her distinctly -
under the piano with a zebra.

29:52.708 --> 29:53.155
But, Ruth...

29:53.156 --> 29:54.750
- I am not going to stay
here arguing any longer.

29:54.835 --> 29:55.960
- Hooray.
- Shut up.

29:56.044 --> 29:58.421
- How dare you speak to me like that!
- But listen, Ruth, please -

29:58.505 --> 30:00.965
I will not listen
to any more of this nonsense.

30:01.049 --> 30:04.427
I'm going upstairs to bed now.
I shall leave you to turn out the lights.

30:04.511 --> 30:06.387
I won't be asleep -
I'm much too upset -

30:06.472 --> 30:09.807
so you can come in and say good night to me
if you feel like it.

30:09.892 --> 30:11.476
Well, that's big of her, I must say.

30:11.560 --> 30:13.728
Be quiet!
You're behaving like a guttersnipe.

30:14.730 --> 30:16.647
That is all I have to say.

30:16.732 --> 30:18.524
Good night, Charles.

30:25.866 --> 30:28.993
That was one of the most enjoyable
half hours I've ever spent.

30:29.077 --> 30:32.455
- Oh, Elvira, how could you?
- Poor Ruth.

30:33.248 --> 30:35.333
This is obviously
some sort of hallucination, isn't it?

30:36.084 --> 30:39.045
I'm afraid I don't know
the technical term for it.

30:39.129 --> 30:42.006
Well, where have you come from?

30:42.090 --> 30:45.384
Do you know, it's very peculiar,
but I've sort of forgotten.

30:46.470 --> 30:47.970
Are you to be here indefinitely?

30:48.055 --> 30:50.515
I'm afraid I don't know that either.

30:50.599 --> 30:52.934
Why? Would you hate it so much if I was?

30:53.602 --> 30:55.269
Well, you must admit
it would be embarrassing.

30:55.354 --> 30:58.856
I don't see why really.
It's all a question of adjusting yourself.

30:58.941 --> 31:02.777
Anyway, I think it's horrid of you
to be so unwelcoming and disagreeable.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.987
- Now look here, Elvira.
- I do. I think you're mean.

31:05.113 --> 31:06.535
Well, try to see my point of view, dear.

31:06.536 --> 31:09.200
I've been married to Ruth for five
years, and you've been dead for seven.

31:09.284 --> 31:11.911
Not dead, Charles. Passed over.

31:11.995 --> 31:15.373
It's considered very vulgar to say "dead"
where I come from.

31:15.457 --> 31:17.208
Passed over then.

31:17.292 --> 31:19.585
I don't believe you love me anymore.

31:19.670 --> 31:21.712
I shall always love the memory of you.

31:21.797 --> 31:23.881
Well, I really am a little hurt.

31:23.966 --> 31:27.468
You called me back,
and at greet inconvenience I came...

31:27.553 --> 31:30.513
and you've been thoroughly churlish
ever since I arrived.

31:30.597 --> 31:33.391
Believe me, Elvira, I most emphatically
did not call you back.

31:33.475 --> 31:36.602
- There's been some mistake.
- Perhaps it was your subconscious.

31:36.687 --> 31:38.636
You must find out if
you're going to stay or not,

31:38.637 --> 31:40.273
and we can make
arrangements accordingly.

31:40.357 --> 31:42.733
- I don't see how I can.
- Well, try and think.

31:42.818 --> 31:45.403
Isn't there anyone that you know
that you can get in touch with over there...

31:45.487 --> 31:48.489
or on the other side or whatever it's called
who can advise you?

31:49.116 --> 31:51.742
No. I can't think.

31:51.827 --> 31:55.079
It all seems so far away,
as though I'd dreamed it.

31:55.831 --> 31:58.082
Oh, Charles.

31:58.166 --> 31:59.542
What is it?

31:59.626 --> 32:01.932
- I want to cry, but I
don't think I'm able to.

32:01.933 --> 32:03.421
What do you want to cry for?

32:03.505 --> 32:07.717
Well, it's seeing you again, and you being
so irascible like you always used to be.

32:07.801 --> 32:11.887
- I don't mean to be irascible, Elvira.
- Darling, I don't mind really. I never did.

32:13.640 --> 32:15.308
Is it cold being a ghost?

32:15.392 --> 32:17.226
No, I don't think so.

32:17.311 --> 32:18.936
What happens if I touch you?

32:19.021 --> 32:21.272
I doubt if you can.

32:21.356 --> 32:23.316
Do you want to?

32:24.943 --> 32:26.611
Oh, Elvira.

32:35.621 --> 32:38.122
What is it, darling?

32:38.206 --> 32:40.499
Oh, it certainly does seem strange
seeing you again.

32:40.584 --> 32:42.293
That's better.

32:42.377 --> 32:43.711
What's better?

32:43.795 --> 32:45.713
Your voice was kinder.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.801
Was I ever unkind to you
when you were alive?

32:50.886 --> 32:51.927
Often.

32:52.012 --> 32:53.638
Oh, how can you?
I'm sure you're exaggerating.

32:53.722 --> 32:54.889
Not at all.

32:54.973 --> 32:59.226
You were an absolute pig that time we went
to Cornwall and stayed in that awful hotel.

32:59.311 --> 33:01.479
You hit me with a billiard cue.

33:03.440 --> 33:05.816
Mmm. Only very, very gently.

33:07.486 --> 33:09.487
I loved you very much.

33:10.530 --> 33:12.406
I loved you too.

33:25.212 --> 33:28.422
No, I can't touch you.
Isn't that horrible?

33:28.507 --> 33:32.593
Hmm. Perhaps it's just as well
if I'm to stay here for any length of time.

33:35.555 --> 33:39.684
I suppose I shall wake up eventually,
but I feel strangely peaceful now.

33:39.768 --> 33:42.186
That's right. Put your head back.

33:42.270 --> 33:43.938
Like this?

33:46.775 --> 33:48.693
Can you feel anything?

33:50.612 --> 33:52.863
Only a very little breeze through my hair.

33:52.948 --> 33:55.032
Well, that's better than nothing.

33:57.411 --> 34:01.372
I suppose if I'm really out of my mind,
they'll put me in an asylum.

34:01.456 --> 34:04.333
Don't you worry about that. Just relax.

34:06.086 --> 34:07.545
Poor Ruth.

34:07.629 --> 34:10.715
Mmm. Nuts to Ruth.

35:37.969 --> 35:39.470
Good morning, Edith.

35:39.554 --> 35:41.180
- Good morning, sir.
- Feeling fit?

35:41.264 --> 35:42.765
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

35:42.849 --> 35:45.351
- How's Cook?
- I don't know, sir. I haven't asked her.

35:45.435 --> 35:47.770
You should. You should begin every day
by asking everyone how they are.

35:47.854 --> 35:49.480
- It oils the wheels.
- Yes, sir.

35:49.564 --> 35:51.565
- Greet her for me, will you?
- Yes, sir.

35:58.740 --> 36:00.866
- Good morning, darling.
- Good morning, Charles.

36:00.951 --> 36:03.118
- It certainly is.
- What certainly is what?

36:03.203 --> 36:05.329
A good morning.
A tremendously good morning.

36:05.413 --> 36:09.375
There isn't a cloud in the sky,
and everything looks newly washed.

36:09.459 --> 36:11.168
Anything interesting in The Times?

36:11.253 --> 36:13.546
Don't be silly, Charles.

36:13.630 --> 36:16.131
- I intend to work all day.
- Good.

36:17.133 --> 36:19.450
- It's extraordinary
about daylight, isn't it?

36:19.451 --> 36:20.386
How do you mean?

36:20.470 --> 36:23.472
Oh, the way it reduces everything to normal.

36:23.557 --> 36:25.516
I'm sure I'm very glad to hear it.

36:25.600 --> 36:28.602
- You're very glacial this morning.
- Are you surprised?

36:29.604 --> 36:33.148
Yes. I take back what I said about it being
a good morning. It's a horrid morning.

36:33.233 --> 36:35.985
You'd better eat your breakfast
while it's hot.

36:36.069 --> 36:37.444
It isn't.

36:37.529 --> 36:38.904
Now look here, Charles.

36:38.989 --> 36:41.991
In your younger days, this display of roguish
flippancy might have been alluring.

36:42.075 --> 36:43.784
In a middle-aged novelist, it's nauseating.

36:43.869 --> 36:45.625
- I don't see what I've
done that's so awful.

36:45.626 --> 36:47.037
You behaved abominably last night.

36:47.122 --> 36:49.123
You wounded me and insulted me.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.875
I was the victim of an aberration.

36:50.959 --> 36:53.210
- Nonsense. You were drunk.
- Drunk?

36:53.295 --> 36:56.110
You had two strong dry
martinis before dinner,

36:56.145 --> 36:57.548
a great deal too much
burgundy at dinner...

36:57.632 --> 36:59.842
heaven knows how much port and kümmel
with Dr. Bradman...

36:59.926 --> 37:02.177
while I was doing my best
to entertain that madwoman.

37:02.262 --> 37:04.722
And two large brandies later.
I gave them to you myself.

37:04.806 --> 37:06.974
- Of course you were drunk.
- That's your story, is it?

37:07.058 --> 37:10.519
I wasn't in the least drunk, Ruth.
Something happened to me last night.

37:10.604 --> 37:12.646
Something very peculiar happened to me.

37:12.731 --> 37:14.524
- I really don't wish to
discuss it any further.

37:14.525 --> 37:16.317
- But you must discuss it.
It's very disturbing.

37:16.401 --> 37:19.737
I swear to you that during the séance
I was convinced I heard Elvira's voice.

37:19.821 --> 37:21.572
- Nobody else did.
- I can't help that. I did.

37:21.656 --> 37:22.907
You couldn't have.

37:22.991 --> 37:25.242
And later on, I was equally convinced
she was in the room.

37:25.327 --> 37:27.077
I saw her distinctly and talked to her.

37:27.162 --> 37:30.039
After you'd gone up to bed,
we had quite a cozy little chat.

37:30.123 --> 37:33.334
And you seriously expect me to believe
that you weren't drunk.

37:33.418 --> 37:35.179
I know I wasn't drunk.
If I'd been all that drunk,

37:35.180 --> 37:36.837
I should have a dreadful
hangover, shouldn't I?

37:36.922 --> 37:39.840
- I'm not at all sure that you haven't.
- I haven't got a trace of a headache.

37:39.925 --> 37:42.509
My tongue's not coated. Look at it.

37:42.594 --> 37:44.270
I haven't the least desire
to look at your tongue.

37:44.291 --> 37:45.971
Kindly put it in again.

37:46.056 --> 37:48.182
- Please'm.
- Yes, Edith?

37:48.266 --> 37:50.267
Cook wants to know about lunch, ma'am.

37:50.352 --> 37:52.770
- Will you be in to lunch, Charles?
- Oh, please, don't worry about me.

37:52.854 --> 37:55.189
I shall be perfectly happy
with a bottle of gin in my bedroom.

37:55.273 --> 37:57.942
Don't be silly, dear.
Tell Cook we shall both be in, Edith.

37:58.026 --> 37:59.526
Yes'm.

38:12.540 --> 38:15.167
I'm going into Hythe this morning.
Is there anything you want?

38:15.251 --> 38:17.670
Yes, a great deal, but I doubt
if you could get it in Hythe.

38:17.754 --> 38:19.838
I've put Alka-Seltzer down on my list.

38:19.923 --> 38:21.715
Women! What I think of women.

38:21.800 --> 38:24.343
Your view of women is academic,
to say the least of it.

38:24.427 --> 38:26.136
Just because you've always
been dominated by them...

38:26.221 --> 38:28.514
it doesn't necessarily follow
that you know anything about them.

38:28.598 --> 38:30.307
I've never been dominated by anyone.

38:30.392 --> 38:32.810
You were hagridden by your mother
till you were 23.

38:32.894 --> 38:36.355
Then you got into the clutches
of that awful Mrs. Whatever-her-name-was.

38:36.439 --> 38:38.857
- Mrs. Winthrop-Llewellyn.
- I'm not interested.

38:38.942 --> 38:42.611
Then there was Elvira.
She ruled you with a rod of iron.

38:42.696 --> 38:45.114
Elvira never ruled anyone.
She was far too elusive.

38:45.198 --> 38:47.324
That was one of her greatest charms.

38:47.409 --> 38:49.660
Then there was Maud Charteris.

38:49.744 --> 38:52.079
If you wish to make
an inventory of my sex life, dear...

38:52.163 --> 38:55.332
I think it only fair to tell you
that you've missed out several episodes.

38:55.417 --> 38:58.419
I'll consult my diary
and give you a complete list after lunch.

39:14.436 --> 39:16.437
- Charles.
- Yes?

39:16.521 --> 39:20.441
Alcohol will ruin your whole life
if you allow it to get a hold on you, you know.

39:22.527 --> 39:24.737
Once and for all, Ruth,
I'd like you to understand...

39:24.821 --> 39:28.323
that what happened last night
was nothing whatever to do with alcohol.

39:28.408 --> 39:30.701
I grant you, it may have been
some form of psychic delusion...

39:30.785 --> 39:32.840
but I was stone-cold
sober from first to last...

39:32.841 --> 39:34.538
and extremely upset into the bargain.

39:34.622 --> 39:36.957
You were upset indeed.
What about me?

39:37.042 --> 39:40.461
You behaved with a stolid, obtuse lack
of comprehension which frankly shocked me.

39:40.545 --> 39:42.838
Instead of putting out
a gentle, comradely hand to guide me...

39:42.922 --> 39:45.049
you shouted staccato orders at me
like a sergeant major.

39:45.133 --> 39:47.926
You called me a guttersnipe.
You told me to shut up.

39:48.011 --> 39:50.554
And when I quietly suggested
that we should go upstairs to bed...

39:50.638 --> 39:53.390
you said, with the most disgusting leer,
it was an immoral suggestion.

39:53.475 --> 39:55.559
I was talking to Elvira.

39:55.643 --> 39:59.188
If you were, I can only say it conjures up
a fragrant picture of your first marriage.

39:59.314 --> 40:00.702
My first marriage was
perfectly charming,

40:00.703 --> 40:02.983
and I think it's in the worst
possible taste for you to sneer at it.

40:03.068 --> 40:05.986
I'm not nearly so interested in your
first marriage as you seem to think I am.

40:06.071 --> 40:08.309
It's your second marriage that
is absorbing me at the moment.

40:08.310 --> 40:09.573
It seems to me to be on the rocks.

40:09.657 --> 40:12.076
Only because you persist
in taking up this ridiculous attitude.

40:12.160 --> 40:14.229
My attitude is that of
any normal woman whose...

40:14.230 --> 40:16.163
husband gets drunk
and hurls abuse at her.

40:16.664 --> 40:19.833
- I was not drunk!
- Be quiet. They'll hear you in the kitchen.

40:19.918 --> 40:22.252
I don't care if they hear me
in the Folkestone town hall!

40:22.337 --> 40:23.754
I was not drunk!

40:25.215 --> 40:27.508
- Did you call, sir?
- No!

40:38.478 --> 40:41.647
Charles dear, if you weren't drunk,
how do you account for it?

40:41.731 --> 40:43.565
I can't account for it.
That's what's so awful.

40:43.650 --> 40:46.527
- What did you have for lunch?
- You ought to know. You had it with me.

40:46.611 --> 40:50.155
Let me see. There was lemon sole
and that cheese thing.

40:50.240 --> 40:54.034
Why should having a cheese thing for lunch
make me see my deceased wife after dinner?

40:54.119 --> 40:55.953
You never know.
It was rather rich.

40:56.037 --> 40:59.123
Why didn't you see your dead husband then?
You had just as much of it as I did.

40:59.207 --> 41:01.542
- This isn't getting us anywhere.
- No, of course it isn't.

41:23.064 --> 41:25.440
- Charles dear?
- Yes?

41:25.525 --> 41:28.277
Perhaps there's something
pressing on your brain.

41:30.989 --> 41:32.886
If there were something
pressing on my brain,

41:32.887 --> 41:34.783
I should have violent
headaches, shouldn't I?

41:34.868 --> 41:36.326
Not necessarily.

41:36.411 --> 41:38.801
An uncle of mine had a lump
the size of a cricket ball...

41:38.836 --> 41:40.831
pressing on his brain for years
and he never felt a thing.

41:40.915 --> 41:43.250
I know I should know
if I had anything like that.

41:43.334 --> 41:45.961
- He didn't.
- What happened to him?

41:46.045 --> 41:48.589
He had it taken out, and he's been
as bright as a button ever since.

41:48.673 --> 41:49.965
Did he have any sort of delusions?

41:49.966 --> 41:52.092
I mean, did he think he saw
things that weren't there?

41:52.760 --> 41:54.261
No, I don't think so.

41:54.345 --> 41:56.680
Well, what the blazes
are we talking about him for then?

41:56.764 --> 41:58.432
It's sheer waste of valuable time.

41:58.516 --> 42:00.767
Well, I just brought him up
as an example.

42:12.614 --> 42:15.032
- How do you feel now?
- Physically, do you mean?

42:15.116 --> 42:16.450
Altogether.

42:16.534 --> 42:18.452
Apart from being worried,
I feel quite normal.

42:18.536 --> 42:22.164
Good. You're not seeing or hearing
anything in the least unusual?

42:22.248 --> 42:23.916
Not a thing.

42:46.648 --> 42:48.315
What's the matter now?

42:48.399 --> 42:49.942
She's here again!

42:50.026 --> 42:52.194
- What do you mean? Who's here again?
- Elvira.

42:52.278 --> 42:55.030
You've absolutely ruined
that border by the sundial.

42:55.114 --> 42:57.032
It looks like a mixed salad.

42:57.116 --> 42:58.992
Charles, pull yourself together.

42:59.077 --> 43:01.495
It's all those nasturtiums.
They're so vulgar.

43:01.579 --> 43:04.122
- I like nasturtiums.
- You like what?

43:04.207 --> 43:07.584
They're all right in moderation,
but in a mass like that, they look beastly.

43:07.669 --> 43:09.628
Help me, Ruth.
You've got to help me.

43:09.712 --> 43:12.214
- What did you mean about nasturtiums?
- Never mind about that now.

43:12.298 --> 43:14.091
I tell you, she's here again.

43:14.175 --> 43:16.510
You've been having some nice scenes,
haven't you?

43:16.594 --> 43:18.095
Please mind your own business.

43:18.179 --> 43:20.090
If you behaving like a
lunatic isn't my business,

43:20.091 --> 43:20.931
I don't know what is.

43:21.015 --> 43:23.016
I expect they were about me,
weren't they?

43:23.101 --> 43:26.270
I know I ought to feel sorry, but I'm not.
I'm delighted.

43:26.354 --> 43:29.022
- How can you be so inconsiderate?
- Inconsiderate?

43:29.107 --> 43:31.984
I like that.
I've done everything I can to help.

43:32.068 --> 43:33.777
I've controlled myself admirably.

43:33.861 --> 43:35.122
And I'd like to say here and now...

43:35.123 --> 43:37.447
I don't believe a word about
your beastly hallucinations.

43:37.532 --> 43:39.324
- Ruth, please.
- Don't come near me!

43:39.409 --> 43:41.451
Let her have a nice cry.
It'll do her good.

43:41.536 --> 43:43.453
- You're utterly heartless.
- Heartless!

43:43.538 --> 43:46.498
I wasn't talking to you!
I was talking to Elvira!

43:46.582 --> 43:48.250
Very well. Go on talking to her then.

43:48.334 --> 43:52.004
Talk to her till you're blue in the face,
but don't talk to me.

43:53.214 --> 43:54.881
- Help me, Elvira.
- How?

43:54.966 --> 43:56.444
Well, make her see you or something.

43:56.445 --> 43:58.427
- Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't
possibly manage that.

43:58.511 --> 44:00.423
It's technically the
most difficult business -

44:00.424 --> 44:01.847
frightfully complicated, you know.

44:01.931 --> 44:03.432
It takes years of study.

44:03.516 --> 44:06.226
I don't care how technical it is.
You've got to try.

44:07.729 --> 44:11.106
You are here, aren't you?
You're not an illusion?

44:12.358 --> 44:14.151
No, I was afraid not.

44:15.236 --> 44:18.030
Yes, but - Well -

44:19.073 --> 44:21.408
No, I don't mean to be rude,
but you must see -

44:22.577 --> 44:24.678
Yes, you must make
me a promise in future...

44:24.679 --> 44:27.080
you'll only come and
talk to me when I'm alone.

44:27.749 --> 44:29.499
Well, that's better
than not seeing me at all.

44:29.584 --> 44:31.460
- Charles.
- Yes, dear?

44:31.544 --> 44:33.503
I'm awfully sorry I was cross.

44:33.588 --> 44:35.756
- But, my dear -
- I understand everything now.

44:35.840 --> 44:38.133
- I do really.
- You do?

44:38.217 --> 44:40.302
- Of course I do.
- Look out. She's up to something.

44:40.386 --> 44:42.346
- Will you please be quiet?
- Of course, darling.

44:42.430 --> 44:45.390
We'll all be quiet, won't we?
We'll be as quiet as little mice.

44:45.475 --> 44:46.475
But, Ruth dear -

44:46.559 --> 44:48.935
Now, I want you to come upstairs with me
and go to bed.

44:49.020 --> 44:50.937
The way that woman harps on bed.

44:51.022 --> 44:54.358
- I'll deal with you later.
- Very well, darling. Come along.

44:54.442 --> 44:56.693
- What are you up to?
- I'm not up to anything.

44:56.778 --> 45:00.238
I just want you to go quietly to bed
and wait there till Dr. Bradman comes.

45:00.323 --> 45:01.448
No, Ruth, you're wrong.

45:01.532 --> 45:04.326
She'll have you in a straitjacket
before you know where you are.

45:04.410 --> 45:05.915
Listen, Ruth. If I promise to go to bed,

45:05.916 --> 45:07.871
will you let me stay here
for five minutes longer?

45:07.955 --> 45:10.207
- I really think it would be much better -
- No, now bear with me.

45:10.291 --> 45:13.293
However mad it may seem,
bear with me for just five minutes longer.

45:13.378 --> 45:15.295
Very well. What is it?

45:15.380 --> 45:17.297
Sit down.

45:17.382 --> 45:19.633
- All right. There.
- Now listen. Listen carefully.

45:19.717 --> 45:22.052
Have a cigarette.
It'll soothe your nerves.

45:22.136 --> 45:25.514
- I don't want a cigarette.
- Then you shan't have one, darling.

45:25.598 --> 45:27.724
I want to explain to you
calmly and without emotion...

45:27.809 --> 45:31.478
that beyond any shadow of doubt, the ghost
or shade or whatever you like to call it...

45:31.562 --> 45:34.815
of my first wife, Elvira,
is in this room now.

45:34.899 --> 45:35.941
Yes, dear.

45:36.025 --> 45:38.485
I know you don't believe me
and you're trying valiantly to humor me...

45:38.569 --> 45:40.445
but I'm going to prove it to you.

45:41.489 --> 45:44.991
- Promise you'll do what I ask.
- Well, that depends on what it is.

45:45.076 --> 45:47.202
Ruth, you see this bowl of flowers
on the table?

45:47.286 --> 45:49.246
Yes, dear, I did them myself this morning.

45:49.330 --> 45:52.040
- Very untidily, if I may say so.
- You may not.

45:52.125 --> 45:54.584
Very well.
I never will again, I promise.

45:54.669 --> 45:58.422
Elvira will now carry the bowl of flowers
over to you and back again.

45:59.173 --> 46:01.174
You will, Elvira, won't you?
Just to please me?

46:02.468 --> 46:04.386
Well, just once, please.

46:05.596 --> 46:08.432
Thank you.
Now watch carefully, Ruth.

46:08.516 --> 46:09.975
Yes, dear.

46:10.059 --> 46:12.394
Go on, Elvira.
Take them over to Ruth.

46:24.532 --> 46:27.200
How dare you, Charles?
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

46:27.285 --> 46:29.870
What on earth for?

46:29.954 --> 46:32.205
It's a trick. I know it's a trick.

46:32.290 --> 46:35.083
You've been working up to this.
It's all part of some horrible plan.

46:35.168 --> 46:36.960
It isn't. I swear it isn't.

46:37.044 --> 46:38.962
Elvira, for heaven's sake,
do something else.

46:39.046 --> 46:40.630
Certainly. Anything to oblige.

46:40.715 --> 46:44.718
You want to get rid of me.
You're trying to drive me out of my mind!

46:49.114 --> 46:50.682
I'm not going to put up
with this any longer!

46:50.766 --> 46:52.767
- You must believe me! You must!
- Let me go immediately!

46:52.852 --> 46:55.395
- That was Elvira! I swear it was.
- Let me go.

46:55.480 --> 46:57.147
Ruth, please!

46:58.316 --> 47:00.692
Charles, this is madness, sheer madness.

47:00.776 --> 47:03.945
It's some sort of autosuggestion, isn't it?
Some form of hypnotism.

47:04.030 --> 47:07.199
- Swear to me it's only that.
- Hypnotism, my foot!

47:47.406 --> 47:49.699
Oh, my dear Mrs. Condomine,
how nice of you to call.

47:49.784 --> 47:53.286
- I do hope it isn't inconvenient.
- Inconvenient? Good heavens, no.

47:55.373 --> 47:57.082
Come inside.

47:58.084 --> 48:00.919
Oh, do go into the sitting room,
Mrs. Condomine.

48:02.797 --> 48:05.465
You're just in time for a cup of tea -
that is, if you don't mind China.

48:05.550 --> 48:06.204
Not at all.

48:06.205 --> 48:08.718
- I never touch Indian.
It upsets my vibrations.

48:08.803 --> 48:11.721
Well, do come and sit down.

48:11.806 --> 48:14.391
Good egg.
I'll have this made in a jiffy.

48:19.730 --> 48:23.108
Madame Arcati, I'm profoundly disturbed,
and I want your help.

48:23.192 --> 48:26.069
Splendid. I thought as much.
Now, fire away.

48:26.153 --> 48:29.155
Well, it's most awfully
difficult to explain.

48:29.240 --> 48:31.700
Well, facts first.
Explanations afterwards.

48:31.784 --> 48:33.613
It's the facts that are
so difficult to explain.

48:33.614 --> 48:34.869
They're so fantastic.

48:34.954 --> 48:36.913
Facts very often are.

48:36.998 --> 48:39.499
Come now, take the plunge.
Out with it.

48:39.584 --> 48:42.168
You've heard strange noises
in the night, no doubt.

48:42.253 --> 48:44.546
Boards creaking, doors slamming.

48:44.630 --> 48:46.548
Subdued moaning in the passages.

48:46.632 --> 48:49.092
- Isn't that it?
- No, I'm afraid it isn't.

48:49.176 --> 48:51.011
No sudden gusts of cold wind, I hope?

48:51.095 --> 48:53.096
No. It's worse than that.

48:54.932 --> 48:56.433
I'm all attention.

48:56.517 --> 48:58.268
I know it sounds idiotic...

48:58.352 --> 49:01.438
but the other night, during the séance,
something happened.

49:01.522 --> 49:03.356
I knew it.

49:03.441 --> 49:04.983
Probably a poltergeist.

49:05.067 --> 49:06.401
They're enormously cunning, you know.

49:06.485 --> 49:08.236
They sometimes lie doggo for days.

49:08.321 --> 49:09.779
Poltergeist! Poltergeist!

49:09.864 --> 49:11.197
Pretty poltergeist!

49:11.282 --> 49:12.616
Oh!

49:17.705 --> 49:19.623
Now carry on. I'm all ears.

49:19.707 --> 49:21.541
You know my husband was married before.

49:21.626 --> 49:23.126
Yes. I had heard it mentioned.

49:23.210 --> 49:27.380
His first wife, Elvira,
died comparatively young.

49:27.465 --> 49:29.716
She was convalescing from pneumonia,
and, one evening...

49:29.800 --> 49:32.260
she began to laugh helplessly
at one of the BBC musical programs...

49:32.345 --> 49:33.803
and died of a heart attack.

49:33.888 --> 49:35.639
Just a moment, please.

49:39.060 --> 49:41.394
- Now, where did she die?
- In our present house.

49:45.274 --> 49:47.025
I'm beginning to see daylight.

49:47.902 --> 49:50.737
She materialized the other evening
after I'd gone.

49:50.821 --> 49:52.656
Not to me, but to my husband.

49:52.740 --> 49:54.991
Capital! Capital!
Oh, but that's splendid!

49:55.076 --> 49:57.827
At last! At last!
A genuine materialization!

49:57.912 --> 50:00.080
Please sit down, Madame Arcati.

50:00.164 --> 50:03.583
How could anyone sit down at such a moment?
It's tremendous.

50:03.668 --> 50:05.835
I haven't had such a success
since the Sudbury case.

50:05.920 --> 50:08.088
Nevertheless, I must insist
upon you sitting down...

50:08.172 --> 50:10.090
and controlling your natural exuberance.

50:10.174 --> 50:12.217
I fully appreciate your pride
in your achievement...

50:12.301 --> 50:14.844
but I would like to point out it's made
my position in the house untenable...

50:14.929 --> 50:17.764
and I hold you entirely responsible.

50:17.848 --> 50:20.934
Oh, forgive me, Mrs. Condomine.
I'm being abominably selfish.

50:22.061 --> 50:24.020
- How can I help you?
- How?

50:24.105 --> 50:26.856
By sending her back immediately
to where she came from, of course.

50:26.941 --> 50:28.400
Well, where is she now?

50:28.484 --> 50:30.318
My husband's driven her into Folkestone.

50:30.403 --> 50:33.905
Apparently she was anxious to see an old friend
of hers who's staying at the Grand.

50:42.123 --> 50:44.501
This whole business is
very difficult for Ruth.

50:44.502 --> 50:45.750
We must be fair.

50:45.835 --> 50:47.877
Well, she should learn to be more adaptable.

50:47.962 --> 50:49.754
She probably will in time.

50:49.839 --> 50:51.589
I doubt it, Charles.

50:51.674 --> 50:55.093
She's got a hard mouth.
It's her mouth that gives her away.

50:55.177 --> 50:56.928
Her mouth's got nothing to do with it.

50:57.012 --> 50:59.013
I resent your discussing Ruth
as though she were a horse.

51:04.437 --> 51:07.313
I- I take it your husband
was devoted to her.

51:07.857 --> 51:09.899
I believe so.

51:09.984 --> 51:11.860
Husband devoted.

51:11.944 --> 51:14.320
It was apparently
a reasonably happy marriage.

51:14.405 --> 51:15.905
Oh, tut, tut, tut.

51:18.909 --> 51:21.661
You say she's visible
only to your husband?

51:21.746 --> 51:23.246
Yes.

51:23.330 --> 51:27.917
Visible only... to husband.

51:28.002 --> 51:30.086
Audible, too, I presume.

51:30.171 --> 51:32.088
Extremely audible.

51:32.173 --> 51:35.800
Extremely... audible.

51:46.604 --> 51:48.104
Do you love her?

51:48.189 --> 51:49.898
Yes, of course.

51:49.982 --> 51:51.775
As much as you loved me?

51:51.859 --> 51:53.902
Don't be silly.
It's entirely different.

51:54.737 --> 51:56.279
You always behaved very badly...

51:56.363 --> 51:59.157
and I'm grieved to see
that your sojourn in the other world...

51:59.241 --> 52:01.284
hasn't improved you in the least.

52:52.586 --> 52:55.755
The time has come for me
to admit to you frankly, Mrs. Condomine...

52:55.840 --> 52:58.716
that I haven't the faintest idea
how to get rid of her.

52:58.801 --> 53:00.635
Do you mean to sit there and tell me...

53:00.719 --> 53:04.347
that having mischievously conjured up
this ghost or spirit or whatever she is...

53:04.431 --> 53:06.140
and placed me in a hideous position...

53:06.225 --> 53:08.852
you are unable to do anything about it?

53:08.936 --> 53:10.895
Well, honesty is the best policy.

53:12.189 --> 53:15.191
But this is outrageous. I -
I ought to hand you over to the police.

53:15.776 --> 53:17.485
You go too far, Mrs. Condomine.

53:17.570 --> 53:20.113
I go too far? Indeed.

53:20.197 --> 53:23.658
Do you realize what your insane,
amateur muddling has done?

53:23.742 --> 53:26.953
I have been a professional
ever since I was a child, Mrs. Condomine.

53:27.037 --> 53:29.455
"Amateur" is a word that I cannot tolerate.

53:29.540 --> 53:31.249
It seems to me
to be the height of amateurishness...

53:31.333 --> 53:33.501
to evoke malignant spirits
and not be able to get rid of them.

53:33.586 --> 53:35.879
I resent your tone, Mrs. Condomine.
I really do.

53:35.963 --> 53:37.839
You most decidedly have no right to.

53:37.923 --> 53:39.883
You are to blame
for the whole horrible situation.

53:39.967 --> 53:43.636
May I remind you that I came to your house
on your own invitation.

53:43.721 --> 53:45.430
On my husband's invitation.

53:45.514 --> 53:47.432
The whole thing was planned
in order for him to get material...

53:47.516 --> 53:50.143
for a mystery story he's writing
about a homicidal medium.

53:50.936 --> 53:54.188
Am I to understand that I was only invited
in a spirit of mockery?

53:54.273 --> 53:55.543
No, no, no. Not at all.

53:55.578 --> 53:57.650
He merely wanted to make notes of
some of the tricks of the trade.

53:57.735 --> 53:59.944
Tricks of the trade?

54:00.029 --> 54:01.529
Insufferable!

54:01.614 --> 54:03.948
I've never been so insulted in my life!

54:05.993 --> 54:08.536
I feel we have nothing more
to say to one another, Mrs. Condomine.

54:08.621 --> 54:10.496
But, Madame Arcati, please.

54:10.581 --> 54:12.498
Your attitude from the outset
has been most unpleasant.

54:12.583 --> 54:15.084
Some of your remarks have been
discourteous in the extreme.

54:15.169 --> 54:17.170
And I would like to say,
without umbrage...

54:17.254 --> 54:20.089
that if you and your husband have been
foolish enough to tamper with the unseen...

54:20.174 --> 54:22.926
for paltry motives
and in a spirit of ribaldry...

54:23.010 --> 54:24.802
whatever has happened to you
is your own fault.

54:24.887 --> 54:26.721
And to coin a phrase...

54:26.805 --> 54:30.099
as far as I'm concerned,
you can stew in your own juice!

54:30.184 --> 54:32.727
Good afternoon, Mrs. Condomine.

54:41.987 --> 54:43.696
What on earth are you doing here?

54:43.781 --> 54:45.865
- I've been calling on Madame Arcati.
- Whatever for?

54:45.950 --> 54:48.660
To get rid of me, of course.
To get me exorcized.

54:48.744 --> 54:50.787
- Is that true, Ruth?
- Is what true?

54:50.871 --> 54:53.289
That you went to Madame Arcati
to get Elvira exorcised.

54:53.374 --> 54:55.333
We discussed the possibilities.

54:55.417 --> 54:57.168
There's a snake in the grass for you.

54:57.252 --> 54:58.711
I'm afraid Elvira's sitting here.

54:58.796 --> 55:00.922
Oh, to blazes with Elvira!

55:29.702 --> 55:33.663
You know, Charles,
she's absolutely ruined this room.

55:33.747 --> 55:36.916
She's done nothing of the kind.
It's all a question of taste.

55:37.001 --> 55:38.751
My poor darling Charles.

55:38.836 --> 55:42.797
As far as taste is concerned,
your second marriage was a disaster.

55:42.881 --> 55:46.134
Just look at that awful picture
and that terrifying dress.

55:48.679 --> 55:50.847
- But what's the matter with it?
- What's the matter with what?

55:51.765 --> 55:53.307
I think it's very charming.

55:53.392 --> 55:55.518
Really, this situation is impossible,
and you know it.

55:55.602 --> 55:57.812
If only you'd make an effort
to be a little more friendly to Elvira...

55:57.896 --> 55:59.605
we might all have quite a jolly time.

55:59.690 --> 56:02.150
I have no wish
to have a jolly time with Elvira.

56:02.234 --> 56:04.193
She's certainly very bad-tempered,
isn't she?

56:04.278 --> 56:05.862
I can't think why you married her.

56:05.946 --> 56:09.365
- Where is she at the moment?
- She's on the - Mmm? In the chair.

56:09.450 --> 56:12.410
Oh, you are sweet, Charles darling.

56:12.494 --> 56:13.703
I worship you.

56:13.787 --> 56:16.372
I want to be perfectly frank
with you, Elvira.

56:16.457 --> 56:17.957
Hold on to your hats, boys.

56:18.042 --> 56:21.377
I admit I did see Madame Arcati
with a view to having you exorcized.

56:21.462 --> 56:24.172
I think if you'd been in my position,
you would have done exactly the same.

56:24.256 --> 56:25.715
What did Madame Arcati say?

56:25.799 --> 56:28.718
- She said she couldn't do a thing.
- Hooray.

56:30.012 --> 56:32.638
Don't be upset, Ruth dear.
We shall adjust ourselves, you know.

56:32.723 --> 56:34.599
You must admit it's a unique position.

56:34.683 --> 56:37.226
I can see no reason why we shouldn't
get a great deal of fun out of it.

56:37.311 --> 56:39.771
Fun? How can you, Charles?

56:39.855 --> 56:42.607
- You must be out of your mind.
- Yes, I thought I was at first.

56:42.691 --> 56:44.734
But now I must admit
I'm beginning to enjoy myself.

56:44.818 --> 56:46.444
Oh! This is intolerable!

56:46.528 --> 56:48.237
For heaven's sake,
don't get into another state.

56:49.364 --> 56:52.575
I have been doing my level best
to control myself since yesterday morning...

56:52.659 --> 56:55.161
and I am not going to do it anymore!

56:55.245 --> 56:58.164
I don't like Elvira
any more than she likes me.

56:58.248 --> 57:01.042
And what's more, I'm sure
I never could have - dead or alive.

57:01.126 --> 57:03.628
Lf, since her untimely arrival
the other evening...

57:03.712 --> 57:05.776
she'd shown the slightest
sign of good manners,

57:05.811 --> 57:06.464
the slightest sign of breeding...

57:06.548 --> 57:08.257
I might have felt differently toward her.

57:08.342 --> 57:10.426
As it is, all she's done
is try to make mischief between us...

57:10.511 --> 57:12.553
to have private jokes with you against me.

57:12.638 --> 57:16.140
First thing tomorrow, I'm going up to London
to interview the Psychical Research Society.

57:16.225 --> 57:19.393
And if they fail me, I shall go straight
to the Archbishop of Canterbury.

57:22.481 --> 57:24.315
I shall be back on the 6:45.

57:24.399 --> 57:25.858
You and Elvira can have
the house to yourselves...

57:25.943 --> 57:28.361
and joke and gossip with each other
to your heart's content.

57:31.073 --> 57:32.573
It's clouding over.

57:33.826 --> 57:35.993
You have a genius for understatement.

58:02.396 --> 58:05.523
Edith!

58:10.237 --> 58:12.280
Cook. What on earth's happened?

58:13.699 --> 58:15.199
Where's Edith?

58:44.605 --> 58:45.730
Charles.

58:45.814 --> 58:48.024
Nothing to worry about, Mrs. Condomine.
It's only a slight strain.

58:48.108 --> 58:51.444
Oh! I'm so relieved.
But who was in the ambulance?

58:52.237 --> 58:54.155
That, dear, was the gardener.

58:55.157 --> 58:56.908
Men are much worse patients
than women, you know.

58:56.992 --> 58:58.721
- Particularly highly
strung men like your husband.

58:58.722 --> 58:59.952
Is he highly strung, do you think?

59:00.037 --> 59:02.205
- I'm afraid he's been overworking lately.
- Overworking?

59:02.289 --> 59:04.665
He's in rather a nervous condition.
Nothing serious, you understand.

59:04.750 --> 59:06.667
- What makes you think so?
- I know the symptoms.

59:06.752 --> 59:08.127
What symptoms?

59:08.212 --> 59:10.129
Oh, it's nothing to be unduly alarmed about.

59:10.214 --> 59:11.395
A certain air of strain,

59:11.396 --> 59:14.592
an inability to focus his eyes
on the person he's talking to...

59:14.676 --> 59:17.220
a few rather marked irrelevancies
in his conversation.

59:17.304 --> 59:20.056
I see. Can you remember
any specific example?

59:20.140 --> 59:22.934
Oh, yes. He suddenly shouted,
"What are you doing in the bathroom?"

59:23.018 --> 59:25.061
And then a little later when I was
writing him a prescription...

59:25.145 --> 59:27.396
he suddenly said,
"For heaven's sake, behave yourself. "

59:27.481 --> 59:29.357
How extraordinary.
And how is poor Edith?

59:29.441 --> 59:31.859
She'll be all right in a few days.
It's only a slight concussion.

59:31.944 --> 59:33.319
How does it feel now?

59:33.403 --> 59:35.696
All right.
Is this darn sling really essential?

59:35.781 --> 59:37.490
I had hoped to drive into Folkestone
this evening.

59:37.574 --> 59:40.910
- Be much better if you didn't.
- You could easily wait and go tomorrow.

59:40.994 --> 59:43.704
I can't stand another of those
dreary evenings at home, Charles.

59:43.789 --> 59:45.248
It'll drive me dotty.

59:45.332 --> 59:47.875
Besides, I haven't seen a movie
for seven years.

59:47.960 --> 59:50.378
- Let me be the first to congratulate you.
- What's that, old man?

59:50.462 --> 59:52.463
Charles, do try to be sensible.
I implore you.

59:52.547 --> 59:53.881
Sorry. I forgot.

59:53.966 --> 59:55.883
You can drive the car
if you go very slowly and carefully.

59:55.968 --> 59:57.969
Use your right arm as little as possible.

01:00:06.395 --> 01:00:08.187
Thank you.

01:00:08.272 --> 01:00:10.773
- Good-bye, Mrs. Condomine.
- Good-bye.

01:00:13.151 --> 01:00:14.944
I'll pop around
and see you again tomorrow morning.

01:00:15.028 --> 01:00:16.195
Thank you.

01:00:19.992 --> 01:00:21.492
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

01:00:24.705 --> 01:00:26.497
Charles.

01:00:26.581 --> 01:00:28.582
- Yes?
- Where's Elvira?

01:00:28.667 --> 01:00:30.376
She's slipped out of the front door
with Dr. Bradman.

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:33.921
- Are you sure she's not here?
- Yes. Quite sure.

01:00:34.006 --> 01:00:36.674
- Good. I want to talk to you.
- Oh, dear.

01:00:36.758 --> 01:00:39.218
You're not going to start
making scenes again, are you?

01:00:39.303 --> 01:00:41.137
This is a fight, Charles.

01:00:41.221 --> 01:00:43.264
It's a duel to the death
between Elvira and me.

01:00:43.348 --> 01:00:44.807
Melodramatic hysteria.

01:00:44.891 --> 01:00:48.227
The poor little thing comes back trustingly
after all these years in the other world -

01:00:48.312 --> 01:00:50.021
Elvira is about as trusting
as a puff adder...

01:00:50.105 --> 01:00:51.897
and a good deal more dangerous
into the bargain.

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:52.815
Dangerous?

01:00:52.899 --> 01:00:54.859
She came here with one purpose
and one purpose only.

01:00:54.943 --> 01:00:57.153
And if you can't see it,
you're a bigger fool than I thought you.

01:00:57.237 --> 01:00:59.822
What purpose could she have
beyond the natural desire to see me again?

01:00:59.906 --> 01:01:02.658
After all, you must remember she was
extremely attached to me, poor child.

01:01:02.743 --> 01:01:06.329
Her purpose is perfectly obvious.
It's to get you to herself forever.

01:01:06.413 --> 01:01:09.457
- That's absurd. How could she?
- By killing you off, of course.

01:01:09.541 --> 01:01:11.584
Killing me off? You're mad.

01:01:11.668 --> 01:01:14.128
Doesn't it strike you as peculiar
that you, Cook, Edith and Webb...

01:01:14.212 --> 01:01:17.214
all met with violent accidents
on the same day?

01:01:17.299 --> 01:01:18.716
Yes, but why should she want
to kill me?

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.843
I could understand her wanting to kill you,
but why me?

01:01:20.927 --> 01:01:23.346
If you were dead,
it would be her final triumph over me.

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:27.183
She'd have you forever on her beastly
astral plane, and I'd be left high and dry.

01:01:27.267 --> 01:01:30.019
She's probably planning
some sort of spiritual remarriage.

01:01:30.103 --> 01:01:32.313
I wouldn't put anything past her.

01:01:32.397 --> 01:01:33.356
Ruth.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:36.859
For heaven's sake, stop looking like
a wounded spaniel and concentrate.

01:01:36.943 --> 01:01:40.029
This is serious.
I'm going to see Madame Arcati.

01:01:40.113 --> 01:01:42.323
I don't care how cross she is.
She's got to help us.

01:01:42.407 --> 01:01:44.116
Even if she can't get rid of Elvira...

01:01:44.201 --> 01:01:46.994
she must know some technical method
of rendering her harmless.

01:01:47.079 --> 01:01:50.539
I'll be back in half an hour.
Tell Elvira I've gone to see the vicar.

01:01:51.958 --> 01:01:54.752
- This is appalling.
- Never mind about that.

01:01:54.836 --> 01:01:58.923
Remember now, don't give yourself away
by so much as the flick of an eyelid.

01:01:59.007 --> 01:02:00.216
- Look out.
- What?

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:02.510
I- I merely said it was a nice lookout.

01:02:02.594 --> 01:02:04.136
What is a nice lookout?

01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:05.846
The-The weather, Elvira.

01:02:05.931 --> 01:02:08.682
I find it very difficult to believe
that at this particular moment...

01:02:08.767 --> 01:02:12.395
you and Ruthie can't think of anything more
interesting to talk about than the weather.

01:02:12.479 --> 01:02:14.772
Ah, but the glass has gone down
and down and down.

01:02:14.856 --> 01:02:16.774
It's positively macabre.

01:02:16.858 --> 01:02:19.026
Charles and I were not
discussing the weather, Elvira.

01:02:19.111 --> 01:02:21.529
I was trying to persuade him
not to drive you into Folkestone this evening.

01:02:21.613 --> 01:02:25.116
It would be bad for his arm, and you can
easily wait and go tomorrow.

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:28.994
However, as he seems determined to place
your wishes before mine in everything...

01:02:29.079 --> 01:02:31.914
I really have nothing further to say.

01:02:31.998 --> 01:02:35.042
I'm sure I hope
you both enjoy yourselves very much.

01:02:36.002 --> 01:02:37.711
Are you ready?

01:02:37.796 --> 01:02:39.505
- What for?
- To go to Folkestone, of course.

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:41.090
I just want a glass of sherry first.

01:02:41.174 --> 01:02:42.842
I don't believe you want
to take me at all.

01:02:42.968 --> 01:02:43.784
Of course I want to take you,

01:02:43.785 --> 01:02:46.345
but I still think it would be more sensible
to wait until tomorrow. It's a filthy night.

01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:49.598
- Oh, how familiar all this is.
- In what way familiar?

01:02:49.683 --> 01:02:52.768
All through our married life,
I only had to suggest something...

01:02:52.853 --> 01:02:55.104
for you immediately to start hedging me off.

01:02:55.188 --> 01:02:57.773
I wasn't hedging you off.
I merely said that I thought -

01:02:57.858 --> 01:03:02.403
Oh, all right. We'll spend another nice
cozy, intimate evening at home...

01:03:02.487 --> 01:03:06.031
with Ruth sewing away
at that hideous table center...

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:08.033
and snapping at us like a terrier.

01:03:08.118 --> 01:03:10.744
Ruth is perfectly aware
the table center is hideous.

01:03:10.829 --> 01:03:12.913
It happens to be a birthday present
for her mother.

01:03:12.998 --> 01:03:14.790
If you don't behave,
I shan't take you into Folkestone ever.

01:03:14.875 --> 01:03:17.793
Oh, please, Charles,
don't be elderly and grand with me.

01:03:17.878 --> 01:03:20.546
- Please let's go now.
- Not until I've had my sherry.

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:22.882
Besides, the car won't be back
for half an hour at least.

01:03:23.717 --> 01:03:25.509
- What do you mean?
- Ruth's taken it.

01:03:25.594 --> 01:03:27.970
- She had to go and see the vicar.
- What?

01:03:28.054 --> 01:03:29.346
What's the matter?

01:03:29.431 --> 01:03:31.974
You say that Ruth has taken the car?

01:03:32.058 --> 01:03:33.809
Yes, to go and see the vicar,
but she won't be long.

01:03:33.894 --> 01:03:35.769
Oh, Charles. Oh, Charles.

01:03:35.854 --> 01:03:38.230
What are you behaving like that for?
What have you done?

01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:40.024
Done? I haven't done anything.

01:03:40.108 --> 01:03:42.109
- Elvira, you're lying.
- I'm not lying. What's there to lie about?

01:03:42.194 --> 01:03:42.957
What are you in such a state for?

01:03:42.958 --> 01:03:44.069
- I'm not in a state. I
don't know what you mean.

01:03:44.154 --> 01:03:45.863
- You've done something dreadful.
- Don't look at me like that, Charles.

01:03:45.947 --> 01:03:48.657
- I haven't. I swear I haven't.
- The car. That's it - the car.

01:03:48.742 --> 01:03:49.950
No, Charles. No.

01:03:50.035 --> 01:03:51.952
Ruth was right. You were trying to kill me.
You've done something to the car.

01:03:52.037 --> 01:03:55.206
Oh, oh, oh.

01:03:56.249 --> 01:03:58.250
Ruth!

01:03:59.211 --> 01:04:00.711
Ruth!

01:04:06.426 --> 01:04:07.927
Hello. Yes?

01:04:08.553 --> 01:04:10.846
Speaking. Yes?

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:15.100
The bridge at the bottom of the hill.

01:04:17.604 --> 01:04:19.647
Yes, yes. I'll come at once.

01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:31.367
Ruth.

01:04:36.623 --> 01:04:40.543
Well, of all the filthy low-down tricks.

01:04:40.627 --> 01:04:42.086
Ow! Ruth!

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:46.131
Stop it! Get away from me!

01:04:46.216 --> 01:04:48.217
Leave me alone! Oh!

01:04:48.301 --> 01:04:51.178
Leave me alone!

01:04:52.389 --> 01:04:55.683
Oh! Ruth!

01:04:55.767 --> 01:04:57.685
Leave me alone!

01:04:59.854 --> 01:05:00.980
Oh, Ruth!

01:05:01.064 --> 01:05:03.399
I didn't mean it! Ow!

01:05:34.139 --> 01:05:35.639
Come in.

01:05:47.152 --> 01:05:48.861
Thank you, Edith.

01:06:06.713 --> 01:06:08.088
Oh.

01:06:09.883 --> 01:06:10.799
Hello.

01:06:10.884 --> 01:06:13.177
Oh, hello, Mr. Condomine.

01:06:13.261 --> 01:06:16.388
Um, I hope you won't consider this
an intrusion, Mr. Condomine...

01:06:16.473 --> 01:06:19.183
but I felt a tremendous urge -
like a rushing wind -

01:06:19.267 --> 01:06:21.310
so I hopped on my bike,
and here I am.

01:06:21.394 --> 01:06:24.480
I reproach myself bitterly, you know.
I threw up the sponge.

01:06:24.564 --> 01:06:26.815
In a moment of crisis,
I threw up the sponge...

01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:28.776
instead of throwing down the gauntlet.

01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:30.390
Yes, well, whatever you
threw, Madame Arcati,

01:06:30.391 --> 01:06:31.987
I'm afraid there's nothing
whatever to be done.

01:06:32.072 --> 01:06:34.156
Oh, but there is. There is.

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:35.824
I found a formula.

01:06:35.909 --> 01:06:40.079
It came to me last night, Mr. Condomine.
It came to me in a blinding flash.

01:06:40.163 --> 01:06:42.456
I'd just finished my Ovaltine
and turned out the light...

01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:45.250
when I suddenly started up in bed
with a loud cry.

01:06:45.335 --> 01:06:47.503
"Great Scott!" I said. "I've got it!"

01:06:47.587 --> 01:06:49.922
And at 3:00 in the morning,
with my brain fairly seething...

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:51.799
I went to work on my crystal
for a little.

01:06:51.883 --> 01:06:54.635
Pluck up your heart, Mr. Condomine.
All is not lost.

01:06:56.846 --> 01:06:57.677
Well, I'm very glad to hear it,

01:06:57.678 --> 01:07:00.349
but I think we should leave
things as they are for the present.

01:07:00.433 --> 01:07:03.811
I- I-I - Mr. Condomine?

01:07:05.063 --> 01:07:07.147
If you'll pardon my
bluntness, Mr. Condomine,

01:07:07.148 --> 01:07:08.732
I think you're a blithering idiot.

01:07:08.817 --> 01:07:10.526
You're at liberty
to think whatever you please.

01:07:10.610 --> 01:07:12.611
Oh, well, have it your own way,
Mr. Condomine...

01:07:12.696 --> 01:07:16.031
but I warn you that it's no good locking
the stable door after the horse is gone.

01:07:16.116 --> 01:07:17.449
Hmm!

01:07:20.787 --> 01:07:23.497
Charles, I can't stand this house
another minute.

01:07:23.581 --> 01:07:24.957
Really, Elvira, I'm surprised at you.

01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:27.710
I don't care how surprised you are.
I want to go home.

01:07:27.794 --> 01:07:30.003
- Now don't be childish.
- I'm not being childish.

01:07:30.088 --> 01:07:33.048
Ruth has hardly left my side
for a minute.

01:07:33.133 --> 01:07:36.635
- Well, is she here now?
- No. She's upstairs lying down.

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:38.387
The funeral exhausted her.

01:07:43.727 --> 01:07:45.894
This whole thing has been a failure.

01:07:47.939 --> 01:07:52.234
A dreary, miserable failure,
and, oh, what high hopes I started out with.

01:07:52.318 --> 01:07:54.111
You can't expect much sympathy
from me, you know.

01:07:54.195 --> 01:07:56.822
I'm perfectly aware that your highest hope
was to murder me.

01:07:56.906 --> 01:08:00.075
Don't put it like that.
It sounds so beastly.

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:02.536
Anyway, it was only because I loved you.

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:05.873
The silliest thing I ever did in
my whole life was to love you.

01:08:05.957 --> 01:08:07.708
You were always unworthy of me.

01:08:07.792 --> 01:08:11.336
That remark comes perilously near
impertinence, Elvira.

01:08:12.338 --> 01:08:16.633
I sat there on the other side
day after day just longing for you.

01:08:16.718 --> 01:08:18.343
I did. Really.

01:08:18.428 --> 01:08:21.013
That was why I put myself down
for a return visit...

01:08:21.096 --> 01:08:23.390
and had to fill in all those forms...

01:08:23.475 --> 01:08:26.894
and wait about in drafty passages
for hours.

01:08:28.645 --> 01:08:32.274
If only you'd died before you met Ruth,
everything might have been all right.

01:08:32.358 --> 01:08:33.776
She's absolutely ruined you.

01:08:33.859 --> 01:08:36.779
I hadn't been in the house for a day
before I realized that.

01:08:36.863 --> 01:08:39.448
Your books aren't a quarter as good
as they used to be either.

01:08:39.532 --> 01:08:41.033
That's entirely untrue.

01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:43.535
Ruth helped me and encouraged me
in my work, which is more than you ever did.

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:45.496
I should think that's probably
what's wrong with it.

01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:47.663
All you thought about
was going to parties and enjoying yourself.

01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:51.167
Well, why shouldn't I have fun?
I died young, didn't I?

01:08:53.837 --> 01:08:55.798
You needn't have died at all
if you hadn't been idiotic enough...

01:08:55.881 --> 01:08:58.801
to go out in that punt with Guy Henderson
and get soaked to the skin.

01:08:58.885 --> 01:09:01.553
It was not a punt.
It was a little launch.

01:09:01.638 --> 01:09:03.555
I don't care
if it was a three-masted schooner.

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.640
You had no right to go.

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:08.852
You behaved abominably over Guy Henderson.
There's no use pretending you didn't.

01:09:08.937 --> 01:09:11.395
Guy adored me.

01:09:11.481 --> 01:09:13.649
And anyway, he was very attractive.

01:09:14.776 --> 01:09:17.152
You told me distinctly
that he didn't attract you in the least.

01:09:17.237 --> 01:09:20.363
Well, you'd have gone through the roof
if I'd told you that he did.

01:09:21.407 --> 01:09:24.827
Anyway, you seem to forget why I went.

01:09:24.911 --> 01:09:28.497
You seem to forget that you spent
the entire evening making sheep's eyes...

01:09:28.581 --> 01:09:31.416
at that overblown harridan
in the false pearls.

01:09:32.585 --> 01:09:36.462
A woman in Cynthia Cheviot's position
would hardly wear false pearls.

01:09:36.548 --> 01:09:38.841
Well, they were practically
all she was wearing.

01:09:39.759 --> 01:09:44.011
Yes, I'm pained to observe that seven years
in the echoing vaults of eternity...

01:09:44.096 --> 01:09:46.807
have in no way impaired
your native vulgarity.

01:09:47.934 --> 01:09:50.602
That was the remark of a pompous ass.

01:09:51.729 --> 01:09:53.354
I'm sick of these insults.
Please go away.

01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:55.440
There's nothing I should like to do better.

01:09:56.776 --> 01:09:59.570
You've got to get hold of that old gal again
and set her to work.

01:09:59.654 --> 01:10:02.030
I won't tolerate this another minute.

01:10:02.115 --> 01:10:03.866
For heaven's sake, don't snivel.

01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:05.701
She's got to get me out of this.

01:10:05.785 --> 01:10:07.411
I want to go home.

01:10:07.495 --> 01:10:09.621
I quite agree, and the sooner the better.

01:10:12.375 --> 01:10:14.459
On looking back
on our married years, Elvira...

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:18.589
I see now with horrid clarity
that they were nothing but a mockery.

01:10:18.673 --> 01:10:20.841
You invite mockery, Charles.

01:10:20.925 --> 01:10:24.845
Something to do with your personality,
I think - a certain seedy grandeur.

01:10:24.929 --> 01:10:26.638
- Now once and for all -
- You never suspected it...

01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:30.517
but I laughed at you steadily
from the altar to the grave.

01:10:30.602 --> 01:10:34.229
All your ridiculous petty jealousies
and your fussings and fumings.

01:10:34.314 --> 01:10:37.566
You were feckless and irresponsible
and morally unstable.

01:10:37.650 --> 01:10:39.568
I realized that
before we left Budleigh Salterton.

01:10:39.652 --> 01:10:41.403
Nobody but a monumental bore...

01:10:41.487 --> 01:10:44.323
would have thought of having a honeymoon
in Budleigh Salterton.

01:10:44.407 --> 01:10:47.075
And what is the matter
with Budleigh Salterton?

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:49.202
I was an eager young bride, Charles.

01:10:49.287 --> 01:10:51.747
I wanted glamour and music and romance.

01:10:51.831 --> 01:10:56.668
What I got was potted palms seven hours
of every day on a damn golf course...

01:10:56.753 --> 01:10:59.421
and a three-piece orchestra
playing Merrie England.

01:10:59.505 --> 01:11:02.424
- Pity you didn't tell me so at the time.
- I did, but you wouldn't listen.

01:11:04.469 --> 01:11:09.890
That was why I went out on the moors
that day with Captain Bracegirdle.

01:11:09.974 --> 01:11:11.767
I was desperate.

01:11:11.851 --> 01:11:14.436
You swore to me that you'd gone over
to see your aunt in Exmouth.

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:17.064
Mmm, it was the moors.

01:11:17.148 --> 01:11:21.234
With Captain Bracegirdle.

01:11:21.319 --> 01:11:24.780
With Captain Brace -
I might have known it.

01:11:24.864 --> 01:11:28.033
What a fool I was.
What a blind fool.

01:11:31.079 --> 01:11:33.246
- Did he make love to you?
- Of course.

01:11:33.331 --> 01:11:36.625
- Oh, Elvira.
- Only very discreetly.

01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:38.460
He was in the cavalry, you know.

01:11:38.544 --> 01:11:40.754
All I can say is that I'm well rid of you.

01:11:40.838 --> 01:11:42.673
Unfortunately, you're not.

01:11:42.757 --> 01:11:44.549
With any luck, I soon will be.

01:12:04.737 --> 01:12:06.321
Ah, Mr. Condomine.

01:12:06.406 --> 01:12:08.407
Well, I can't say I'm entirely surprised.

01:12:08.491 --> 01:12:10.242
I'm afraid I've broken your -

01:12:11.494 --> 01:12:13.245
Do come inside.

01:12:15.456 --> 01:12:18.166
Oh, take off your coat.
Just sling it over the bannisters.

01:12:18.251 --> 01:12:20.335
Madame Arcati, I want you
to meet my first wife, Elvira.

01:12:22.296 --> 01:12:24.673
Oh. Oh, my dear. How do you do?

01:12:24.757 --> 01:12:26.508
No, she's not there.
She's, uh, in the doorway.

01:12:28.261 --> 01:12:30.095
Are you happy, my dear?

01:12:30.179 --> 01:12:32.180
Tell the silly old bag
to mind her own business.

01:12:32.265 --> 01:12:33.974
Was the journey difficult?

01:12:34.058 --> 01:12:36.476
- Are you weary?
- Oh, she's dotty.

01:12:36.561 --> 01:12:38.854
This is wonderful. Wonderful.
I almost have contact.

01:12:38.938 --> 01:12:41.857
- I can sense the vibrations.
- But, Madame Arcati, she's gone in there.

01:12:47.113 --> 01:12:48.697
How fascinating.

01:12:51.909 --> 01:12:54.703
Very interesting.
I smell ectoplasm strongly.

01:12:54.787 --> 01:12:57.372
What a disgusting thing to say.

01:12:57.457 --> 01:12:59.708
Well, go on, Elvira. Don't be a spoilsport.
Give her a bit of encouragement.

01:12:59.792 --> 01:13:04.421
Oh, all right. Not that I approve of these
Maskelyne and Devant carryings-on.

01:13:08.384 --> 01:13:10.302
Yes, yes. Again. Again.

01:13:13.765 --> 01:13:15.891
- Oh!
- How's that?

01:13:15.975 --> 01:13:18.477
This is first-rate. It really is first-rate.

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:20.062
Absolutely stunning.

01:13:20.146 --> 01:13:21.521
I'm so glad you're pleased.

01:13:22.648 --> 01:13:24.983
You darling. You little darling.

01:13:25.068 --> 01:13:28.612
Oh, stop her fawning on me, Charles,
or I'll break something.

01:13:28.696 --> 01:13:32.324
Madame Arcati, Elvira and I have
discussed the whole situation...

01:13:32.408 --> 01:13:34.117
and she wishes to go home immediately.

01:13:34.202 --> 01:13:36.661
- Home?
- Well, wherever she came from.

01:13:36.746 --> 01:13:38.830
Oh, you don't think she'd like
to stay a few days longer...

01:13:38.915 --> 01:13:41.083
while I try to get things
a little more organized?

01:13:41.167 --> 01:13:42.918
No, no, no. I want to go now.

01:13:43.002 --> 01:13:45.796
You said something about a formula.
What is it?

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:48.590
- Oh, very well. If you insist.
- I most emphatically do insist.

01:13:48.674 --> 01:13:50.801
- Oh, Charles.
- Shut up.

01:13:51.511 --> 01:13:53.512
All right.
I can't guarantee anything, you know.

01:13:53.596 --> 01:13:56.056
- I'll do my best, but it may not work.
- What is the formula?

01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:59.684
Nothing more than a little verse really.
It fell into disuse after the 17th century.

01:13:59.769 --> 01:14:01.520
Oh, I shall need some pepper and salt.

01:14:03.397 --> 01:14:04.106
Ah. Yes.

01:14:04.190 --> 01:14:06.316
We ought of course to have some
shepherd's wort and a frog or two...

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:08.110
but I daresay I can manage without.

01:14:08.194 --> 01:14:09.569
- Is this enough?
- Yes, thanks.

01:14:09.654 --> 01:14:12.280
Now, let me see.

01:14:16.077 --> 01:14:17.869
Ah, yes. Sprinkle it, will you?

01:14:17.954 --> 01:14:20.288
Just a soupçon.
There, right in the middle.

01:14:20.373 --> 01:14:24.251
This is going to be a flop.
I can tell you that here and now.

01:14:24.335 --> 01:14:25.627
Oh, steady, steady, steady.

01:14:25.711 --> 01:14:27.504
And now a few snapdragons
out of that vase.

01:14:27.588 --> 01:14:29.673
There's a good chap.

01:14:33.553 --> 01:14:36.555
If that Mr. Emsworth of the Psychical
Research Society could see me...

01:14:36.639 --> 01:14:38.014
he'd have a fit, he would really.

01:14:42.436 --> 01:14:46.356
Now then, sit down, Mr. Condomine.

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:49.943
And rest your hands on the table,
but don't put your fingers in the pepper.

01:14:50.027 --> 01:14:52.821
I shall switch out the lights myself.

01:14:52.905 --> 01:14:55.073
Oh, shucks! I'd almost forgotten.

01:14:56.826 --> 01:14:59.119
One triangle...

01:14:59.203 --> 01:15:01.580
one half circle...

01:15:01.664 --> 01:15:04.499
and one little dot... there.

01:15:04.584 --> 01:15:08.962
Merlin does this sort of thing at parties
and bores us all stiff with it.

01:15:09.046 --> 01:15:11.798
It's a waste of time.
She's a complete fake.

01:15:11.883 --> 01:15:13.592
Anything's worth trying.

01:15:13.676 --> 01:15:15.969
I am as anxious for it
to succeed as you are.

01:15:16.053 --> 01:15:17.716
Don't make any mistake about that,

01:15:17.717 --> 01:15:20.015
but I'll lay you 10-to-1
it's a dead failure.

01:15:20.641 --> 01:15:22.517
Now, Mr. Condomine...

01:15:22.602 --> 01:15:25.395
if your wife would be kind enough
to lie down on the sofa.

01:15:25.479 --> 01:15:26.396
Go on, Elvira.

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:29.482
This is sheer nonsense.
Don't blame me if I get the giggles.

01:15:29.567 --> 01:15:31.401
Concentrate. Think of nothing.

01:15:31.485 --> 01:15:33.570
That's right. Quite right.

01:15:33.654 --> 01:15:35.352
Now, you won't be
frightened, dear, will you?

01:15:35.353 --> 01:15:36.781
It's absolutely painless.

01:15:37.867 --> 01:15:41.119
Arms at the sides, legs extended.

01:15:41.204 --> 01:15:44.539
Breathe steadily.

01:15:44.624 --> 01:15:50.378
In, out.

01:15:51.088 --> 01:15:52.380
Is she comfortable?

01:15:52.465 --> 01:15:54.466
- Are you comfortable, Elvira?
- No.

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:55.884
Yeah, she's quite comfortable.

01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:59.054
I shall join you in a minute, Mr. Condomine.

01:15:59.138 --> 01:16:02.390
I may have to go into a slight trance,
but, if I do, pay no attention.

01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:15.195
Hold on to yourself, Mr. Condomine.
Concentrate.

01:16:15.279 --> 01:16:17.364
Oh, dear. It's the pepper.

01:16:18.574 --> 01:16:23.078
Ghostly specter, ghoul or fiend,
nevermore be thou convened.

01:16:23.162 --> 01:16:27.916
Shepherd's wort and holy rite
banish thee into the night.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.086
- What a disagreeable little verse.
- Be quiet, Elvira.

01:16:36.175 --> 01:16:39.177
Is there anyone there?
Is there anyone there?

01:16:39.262 --> 01:16:41.304
One rap for yes.
Two raps for no.

01:16:41.389 --> 01:16:43.515
Is there anyone there?

01:16:43.599 --> 01:16:45.100
Good stuff!

01:16:47.061 --> 01:16:49.771
Is that you, Daphne?

01:16:50.398 --> 01:16:54.651
I'm sorry to bother you, dear,
but Mrs. Condomine wants to return.

01:16:54.735 --> 01:16:57.320
Now, then, Daphne.

01:16:57.405 --> 01:17:00.490
Did you hear what I said?

01:17:00.574 --> 01:17:03.118
Can you help us?

01:17:03.202 --> 01:17:06.162
Hold on to it, Mr. Condomine.
It's trying to break away.

01:17:10.126 --> 01:17:12.544
What on earth's happening?

01:17:15.131 --> 01:17:17.757
What's the matter, Madame Arcati?

01:17:17.842 --> 01:17:20.385
Oh, she's in one of her
blasted trances again...

01:17:20.469 --> 01:17:22.470
and I'm as much here as ever I was.

01:17:22.555 --> 01:17:24.848
Are you hurt? Wake up.

01:17:24.932 --> 01:17:27.934
Oh, leave her alone.
She's having a whale of a time.

01:17:28.936 --> 01:17:33.648
If I ever do get back,
I'll strangle that ruddy little Daphne.

01:17:46.412 --> 01:17:48.663
Oh. What happened?

01:17:48.748 --> 01:17:51.750
- Nothing. Nothing at all.
- Yes, it did. Something happened.

01:17:51.834 --> 01:17:54.102
- Yes. You fell over.
That's all that happened.

01:17:54.103 --> 01:17:55.378
What, is she still here?

01:17:55.463 --> 01:17:57.297
- Yes, of course.
- Something must have gone wrong.

01:17:57.381 --> 01:18:01.509
Oh, make her do it again properly, Charles.
I'm sick of being messed about like this.

01:18:01.594 --> 01:18:03.470
Be quiet. She's doing her best.

01:18:03.554 --> 01:18:05.430
Something happened.
I sensed it in my trance. I felt it.

01:18:05.514 --> 01:18:07.015
It shivered through me.

01:18:12.438 --> 01:18:15.231
Once and for all, Charles.
What the devil does this mean?

01:18:24.367 --> 01:18:26.451
Well, I can't think how
I can have been such a duffer.

01:18:26.535 --> 01:18:29.704
- I only hope you're on the right track now.
- Oh, not a doubt of it, Mr. Condomine.

01:18:29.789 --> 01:18:31.915
I think I may confidently promise you
that, next time...

01:18:31.999 --> 01:18:34.417
we shall be able
to kill two birds with one stone.

01:18:34.502 --> 01:18:37.295
I can't feel your simile
is entirely fortunate.

01:19:03.739 --> 01:19:05.824
Mind my crystal, Mr. Condomine.

01:19:08.619 --> 01:19:10.870
Ah!

01:19:10.955 --> 01:19:13.415
Well, now that we've returned
to the scene of the crime, as it were...

01:19:13.499 --> 01:19:15.333
everything will be plain sailing.

01:19:30.099 --> 01:19:31.933
Are they gone?

01:19:33.185 --> 01:19:35.228
- No.
- Oh.

01:19:45.364 --> 01:19:47.740
Are they gone now?

01:19:47.825 --> 01:19:48.992
No.

01:19:54.957 --> 01:19:56.291
Are they gone now?

01:20:17.229 --> 01:20:20.356
Hickory rod and birch in bud...

01:20:20.441 --> 01:20:24.068
toad in the hole and toad in the mud...

01:20:25.404 --> 01:20:29.240
broomstick, bracken and Halloween...

01:20:29.325 --> 01:20:31.784
make these furious spirits seem...

01:20:31.869 --> 01:20:35.163
nothing more than a ghastly dream.

01:20:37.875 --> 01:20:40.418
Are they still here?

01:20:40.503 --> 01:20:41.669
Yes.

01:20:43.255 --> 01:20:45.006
End of Round 6.

01:20:45.090 --> 01:20:47.759
Oh, well, cheer up, Mr. Condomine.

01:20:47.843 --> 01:20:50.178
Rome wasn't built in a day, you know.

01:20:50.262 --> 01:20:54.557
This is definitely one of the most
frustrating nights I've ever spent.

01:20:54.642 --> 01:20:57.519
Hmm. The reply to that is pretty obvious.

01:20:58.312 --> 01:21:00.188
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.

01:21:00.272 --> 01:21:01.773
Oh, skip it.

01:21:07.154 --> 01:21:08.488
Thank you, Mr. Condomine.

01:21:08.572 --> 01:21:11.449
Oh, if you'll excuse me, I'll just have
another of those delicious sandwiches.

01:21:11.534 --> 01:21:12.867
I'm as hungry as a hunter.

01:21:12.952 --> 01:21:15.286
- Would you like a glass of beer?
- No, thank you. Better not.

01:21:18.457 --> 01:21:21.084
Now look here, Charles,
this has gone far enough.

01:21:21.168 --> 01:21:22.544
We've stood up, we've lain down.

01:21:22.628 --> 01:21:25.171
We've concentrated,
we've sat interminably...

01:21:25.256 --> 01:21:28.508
while that tiresome old woman recited
extremely unflattering verses at us.

01:21:28.592 --> 01:21:30.051
We've endured five séances.

01:21:30.135 --> 01:21:33.179
We've watched her fling herself
in and out of trances until we're dizzy.

01:21:33.264 --> 01:21:35.723
And at the end of it, we find ourselves
exactly where we were at the beginning...

01:21:35.808 --> 01:21:37.475
and I'm exhausted.

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:40.770
Well, I'm just as...
exhausted as you are.

01:21:40.854 --> 01:21:42.605
I've been doing
all the blasted table tapping.

01:21:43.315 --> 01:21:47.068
Looks as if Elvira and I will have
to stay together indefinitely in this house.

01:21:47.152 --> 01:21:49.070
You're not going to stay
indefinitely in this house.

01:21:49.154 --> 01:21:51.197
With you then.
We shall have to be with you.

01:21:51.282 --> 01:21:52.991
Oh, I don't see why.

01:21:53.075 --> 01:21:54.659
Why don't you take a cottage somewhere?

01:21:54.743 --> 01:21:57.662
You called us back.

01:21:57.746 --> 01:22:01.249
I've already explained till I'm black in
the face that I did nothing of the sort.

01:22:01.333 --> 01:22:02.584
Madame Arcati says you did.

01:22:02.668 --> 01:22:05.378
Madame Arcati is a muddling old fool.

01:22:05.462 --> 01:22:07.385
If she can't get us back,
she can't. That's that.

01:22:07.386 --> 01:22:08.923
We must try to think of something else.

01:22:09.008 --> 01:22:11.593
She must get you back.
Anything else is unthinkable.

01:22:11.677 --> 01:22:13.386
There's gratitude for you.

01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:16.764
You called us back, and you've done nothing
but try to get rid of us ever since we came.

01:22:16.849 --> 01:22:19.475
- Hasn't he, Elvira?
- He certainly has.

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:21.701
And now, owing to your
idiotic inefficiency,

01:22:21.702 --> 01:22:23.938
we find ourselves in
this mortifying position.

01:22:24.023 --> 01:22:27.609
We're neither fish, flesh, fowl nor...
whatever it is.

01:22:27.693 --> 01:22:29.193
Good red herring.

01:22:32.197 --> 01:22:33.906
Are the girls getting despondent?

01:22:33.991 --> 01:22:37.160
- Yes, I'm afraid they are rather.
- Oh. We mustn't give up hope.

01:22:37.244 --> 01:22:39.579
Chin up, never give in.
That's my motto.

01:22:39.663 --> 01:22:42.957
This schoolgirl phraseology
is driving me mad.

01:22:43.042 --> 01:22:45.084
Now, then.

01:22:45.169 --> 01:22:46.628
Now, then what?

01:22:46.712 --> 01:22:50.298
What do you say if we have another séance
and really put our shoulders to the wheel?

01:22:50.382 --> 01:22:52.091
Make it a real rouser.

01:22:52.176 --> 01:22:54.844
If we're not very careful,
she'll materialize a hockey team.

01:22:54.928 --> 01:22:58.139
Charles, I implore you
not to let her have another séance.

01:22:58.223 --> 01:23:00.350
Now listen, Madame Arcati,
before you go into any further trances...

01:23:00.434 --> 01:23:02.226
I think we should discuss
the situation a little.

01:23:02.311 --> 01:23:04.312
Good. An excellent idea.

01:23:04.396 --> 01:23:07.106
Well, fire away, Mr. Condomine.

01:23:07.191 --> 01:23:09.400
Well, my wives and I have
been talking it over...

01:23:09.485 --> 01:23:13.071
and they're both still absolutely convinced
that I somehow or other called them back.

01:23:13.155 --> 01:23:14.781
Very natural.

01:23:14.865 --> 01:23:17.283
And I'm equally convinced
that I did not.

01:23:17.368 --> 01:23:19.994
Well, neither of them could have appeared
unless there had been somebody -

01:23:20.079 --> 01:23:22.497
some psychic subject - in the house
who wished for them.

01:23:22.581 --> 01:23:26.042
- Yes, well, it wasn't me.
- Perhaps it was Dr. Bradman.

01:23:26.126 --> 01:23:28.920
I never knew he cared.

01:23:32.549 --> 01:23:34.008
Great Scott!

01:23:34.093 --> 01:23:36.928
I believe I've been
barking up the wrong tree.

01:23:37.012 --> 01:23:39.347
- How do you mean?
- The Sudbury case.

01:23:39.431 --> 01:23:41.140
- I don't understand.
- There's no reason why you should.

01:23:41.225 --> 01:23:43.893
It was before your day.
I wonder. Oh, I wonder.

01:23:43.977 --> 01:23:45.687
What was the Sudbury case?
I wish you would explain.

01:23:45.771 --> 01:23:47.897
It was the case that made me famous,
Mr. Condomine.

01:23:47.981 --> 01:23:51.693
It was what you might describe
in theatrical parlance as my first smash hit.

01:23:51.777 --> 01:23:54.112
I had letters from all over the world
about it, especially India.

01:23:54.196 --> 01:23:55.363
What did you do?

01:23:55.447 --> 01:23:57.198
I dematerialized old Lady Sudbury...

01:23:57.282 --> 01:24:00.660
after she'd been firmly entrenched
in the private chapel for over 17 years.

01:24:00.744 --> 01:24:02.704
- How? Can you tell me how?
- Chance. A fluke.

01:24:02.788 --> 01:24:04.539
I happened on it
by the merest coincidence.

01:24:04.623 --> 01:24:06.791
- What fluke? What did you do?
- All in good time. Wait.

01:24:07.710 --> 01:24:09.669
Now, who was present
during our first séance?

01:24:09.753 --> 01:24:11.713
Only the Bradmans and Ruth
and me and yourself.

01:24:11.797 --> 01:24:13.381
To be sure. To be sure.

01:24:13.465 --> 01:24:15.216
But the Bradmans aren't here tonight,
are they?

01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:17.093
- No.
- Quickly. My crystal.

01:24:22.516 --> 01:24:24.016
- Here.
- Thank you.

01:24:26.019 --> 01:24:28.104
Drat the thing, it gives me the pip.
It's cloudy again.

01:24:30.858 --> 01:24:33.401
That's better.
It's there again. It's there again.

01:24:33.485 --> 01:24:35.862
- I'm beginning to understand.
- I wish I was.

01:24:35.946 --> 01:24:38.823
- What's there again?
- It's a bandage. A white bandage.

01:24:40.826 --> 01:24:43.536
Hold on to a white bandage.

01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:45.329
- I haven't got a white bandage.
- Shh!

01:24:50.586 --> 01:24:53.546
She's too good, you know.
She ought to be in a circus.

01:24:58.969 --> 01:25:01.012
Be you in nook or cranny, answer me.

01:25:01.972 --> 01:25:04.474
Be you in still room or closet,
answer me.

01:25:04.558 --> 01:25:08.728
Be you behind the panel,
above the stairs, beneath the eaves...

01:25:08.812 --> 01:25:11.355
waking or sleeping, answer me!

01:25:12.858 --> 01:25:14.609
Well, that ought to do it
or I'm a Dutchman.

01:25:14.693 --> 01:25:16.444
- Do what?
- Shh, shh, shh! Wait.

01:25:33.837 --> 01:25:35.171
It's near.

01:25:36.673 --> 01:25:39.383
It's near. It's very near.

01:25:42.054 --> 01:25:44.555
If it's a ghost, I shall scream.

01:26:06.787 --> 01:26:08.120
Did you ring, sir?

01:26:08.205 --> 01:26:10.456
Bandage. A white bandage.

01:26:13.252 --> 01:26:14.919
- No, Edith.
- I'm sorry, sir.

01:26:15.003 --> 01:26:17.588
I could've sworn I heard the bell
or somebody calling.

01:26:17.673 --> 01:26:20.466
I was asleep.
I don't rightly know which it was.

01:26:24.388 --> 01:26:25.596
Come here, child.

01:26:25.681 --> 01:26:27.223
Oh.

01:26:27.307 --> 01:26:29.767
Well, go on. Go to Madame Arcati.

01:26:29.852 --> 01:26:31.602
It's quite all right.

01:26:35.482 --> 01:26:37.441
Who do you see in this room, child?

01:26:37.526 --> 01:26:40.820
- Oh, dear.
- Answer, please.

01:26:40.904 --> 01:26:42.321
- You, Madame.
- Go on.

01:26:42.406 --> 01:26:45.157
The master.

01:26:45.242 --> 01:26:48.244
- Anyone else?
- Oh, no, Madame.

01:26:48.328 --> 01:26:50.997
- Look again.
- I don't understand, sir.

01:26:51.081 --> 01:26:53.374
Oh, come child,
don't beat about the bush.

01:26:53.458 --> 01:26:55.501
Look again.

01:26:55.586 --> 01:26:57.378
Do you see anyone else now?

01:26:57.462 --> 01:26:59.964
- Oh, no, Madame.
- She's lying.

01:27:00.048 --> 01:27:01.716
- Madame.
- They always do.

01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:03.134
"They"?

01:27:03.218 --> 01:27:05.386
Where are they now?

01:27:05.470 --> 01:27:07.805
By the piano.

01:27:09.558 --> 01:27:11.309
She can see them.

01:27:11.977 --> 01:27:13.728
Do you mean to say she can see them?

01:27:13.812 --> 01:27:15.980
Probably not very clearly, but enough.

01:27:16.064 --> 01:27:18.524
Let me go. I haven't done nothin'
nor seen anybody.

01:27:18.609 --> 01:27:19.984
Let me go back to bed.

01:27:20.068 --> 01:27:21.444
Get her a sandwich.

01:27:21.528 --> 01:27:23.738
I don't want a sandwich.
I want to go back to bed.

01:27:23.822 --> 01:27:26.073
- Oh, nonsense.
- Here you are, Edith.

01:27:26.158 --> 01:27:29.368
A big, healthy girl like you
saying no to a delicious sandwich?

01:27:29.453 --> 01:27:31.579
I never heard of such a thing.

01:27:31.663 --> 01:27:33.414
- Sit down, dear.
- Please, sir, I -

01:27:33.498 --> 01:27:35.207
Now go on, Edith,
do as Madame Arcati says.

01:27:35.292 --> 01:27:37.418
If she's been the cause
of all this unpleasantness...

01:27:37.502 --> 01:27:39.754
I shall give her a week's notice tomorrow.

01:27:39.838 --> 01:27:41.839
You may not be here tomorrow.

01:27:41.924 --> 01:27:43.758
Now look at me, Edith.

01:27:46.178 --> 01:27:49.263
Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo.

01:27:49.348 --> 01:27:52.016
Oh, dear. What's the matter with her?
Is she barmy?

01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:54.393
Here, Edith. This is my finger. Look.

01:27:55.395 --> 01:27:59.190
Have you ever seen
such a long, long, long finger before?

01:28:00.192 --> 01:28:03.527
Now it's on the left.
Now it's on the right.

01:28:03.612 --> 01:28:07.823
Backwards and forwards it goes.
Very quietly. See?

01:28:07.908 --> 01:28:10.284
Backwards and forwards.

01:28:10.369 --> 01:28:14.747
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

01:28:14.831 --> 01:28:16.916
The mouse ran up the clock.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.418
Be quiet. You'll spoil everything.

01:28:19.503 --> 01:28:38.604
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

01:28:47.447 --> 01:28:50.157
â™ª Rumpty-tumty tiddle-lee-um
Hi, ditey-oh-toh â™ª

01:28:52.869 --> 01:28:55.246
- So far, so good. She's off, all right.
- Off?

01:28:55.330 --> 01:28:58.124
She's a natural,
just the same as the Sudbury case.

01:28:58.208 --> 01:29:00.710
Really, it's the most amusing coincidence.

01:29:00.794 --> 01:29:04.338
Now then, if you'd ask your wives
to stand close together, please.

01:29:04.423 --> 01:29:06.674
- Yes, yes. Where?
- Over there by the window.

01:29:06.758 --> 01:29:08.009
Right.

01:29:08.093 --> 01:29:10.219
Ruth, Elvira.

01:29:10.303 --> 01:29:13.055
- I resent being ordered about like this.
- I'm afraid I must insist.

01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:14.807
I don't like this.

01:29:14.891 --> 01:29:17.059
I don't like any of it.

01:29:17.144 --> 01:29:19.520
I feel peculiar.

01:29:19.604 --> 01:29:22.732
It would serve you right
if we flatly refused to do anything at all.

01:29:25.152 --> 01:29:27.153
Are you sorry for having been
so mischievous, Edith?

01:29:27.237 --> 01:29:28.821
Oh, yes, Madame.

01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:31.824
You know what to do now,
don't you, Edith?

01:29:31.908 --> 01:29:33.576
Oh, yes, Madame.

01:29:50.802 --> 01:29:53.054
I believe it's going to work,
whatever it is.

01:29:53.138 --> 01:29:56.515
Oh, Charles.
This is good-bye, Charles.

01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:59.894
Make her stop for a minute, Charles.
There's something I want to say before I go.

01:29:59.978 --> 01:30:01.729
You should have thought of that before.
Too late now.

01:30:01.813 --> 01:30:04.857
- Well, of all the mean, ungrateful -
- Charles, listen a moment.

01:30:04.941 --> 01:30:06.442
Lights.

01:30:21.249 --> 01:30:25.211
I saw Captain Bracegirdle again, Charles.
Several times.

01:30:25.295 --> 01:30:28.672
I went to the Four Hundred with him twice
while you were in Nottingham.

01:30:28.757 --> 01:30:32.426
And I must say that I couldn't have
enjoyed myself more.

01:30:32.511 --> 01:30:34.929
Don't think you're getting rid of us
so easily, my dear.

01:30:35.013 --> 01:30:38.390
You may not be able to see us,
but we shall be here all right.

01:30:38.475 --> 01:30:41.393
I consider you've behaved atrociously
over the whole miserable business.

01:30:43.271 --> 01:30:46.816
They've gone.

01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:49.276
They've really gone.

01:30:49.361 --> 01:30:51.612
Splendid!
Hurrah! We've done it.

01:30:52.739 --> 01:30:54.323
That's quite enough singing
for the moment, Edith.

01:30:54.407 --> 01:30:56.909
Hadn't you better wake her up?
She might bring them back again.

01:30:57.577 --> 01:30:59.620
Wake up, child.

01:30:59.704 --> 01:31:01.205
Wh-Where am I?

01:31:01.289 --> 01:31:02.998
It's all right, Edith.
You can go to bed now.

01:31:03.083 --> 01:31:05.626
But I was in bed.
How did I get down here?

01:31:05.710 --> 01:31:08.212
I rang, Edith.
I rang the bell, and you answered it.

01:31:08.296 --> 01:31:10.464
Did I drop off?
Do you think it's my concussion?

01:31:10.549 --> 01:31:12.883
Now off you go, Edith.
Thank you very much.

01:31:13.677 --> 01:31:15.970
Thank you very much indeed.

01:31:16.054 --> 01:31:17.888
Oh, sir, whatever for?

01:31:19.683 --> 01:31:21.016
Oh, sir!

01:31:23.478 --> 01:31:25.980
Well, what on earth did she mean by that?

01:31:27.941 --> 01:31:31.402
Golly! What a night.

01:31:32.195 --> 01:31:33.612
I'm ready to drop in my tracks.

01:31:33.697 --> 01:31:35.406
I'm deeply grateful to you,
Madame Arcati.

01:31:35.490 --> 01:31:37.116
I don't know what arrangements
you generally make...

01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:38.909
but I trust that you'll
send in your account in due course.

01:31:38.994 --> 01:31:41.495
Good heavens, Mr. Condomine.
It was a pleasure.

01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:43.247
I shouldn't dream of such a thing.

01:31:45.584 --> 01:31:47.418
Would you like to stay?
There's a spare room, you know.

01:31:48.753 --> 01:31:51.172
No, thanks.
Each to his own nest.

01:31:51.256 --> 01:31:53.299
I'll pedal home in a jiffy.
It's only seven miles.

01:31:53.383 --> 01:31:55.217
Oh, I'll collect my tackle later on.

01:31:55.302 --> 01:31:57.303
Perhaps you'd give me the pleasure
of lunching with you one day.

01:31:58.054 --> 01:32:00.431
When you come back,
I shall be delighted.

01:32:00.515 --> 01:32:02.016
Come back?

01:32:03.185 --> 01:32:05.728
Take my advice, Mr. Condomine,
and go away immediately.

01:32:05.812 --> 01:32:07.021
But - What, you don't mean -

01:32:07.105 --> 01:32:09.273
This must be an unhappy house
for you, Mr. Condomine.

01:32:09.357 --> 01:32:12.026
There must be memories both grave and gay
in every corner of it.

01:32:12.110 --> 01:32:13.861
- Also -
- Also what?

01:32:14.863 --> 01:32:18.115
There are more things in heaven and earth,
Mr. Condomine.

01:32:18.783 --> 01:32:21.911
Just go. Pack up your traps and go,
as soon as possible.

01:32:21.995 --> 01:32:23.746
You don't mean they might still be here?

01:32:24.623 --> 01:32:27.499
¿Quién sabe? As the Spanish say.

01:32:40.430 --> 01:32:43.557
Hmm. I think I will take your advice,
Madame Arcati. Thank you very much.

01:32:44.684 --> 01:32:46.936
Well, good-bye, Mr. Condomine.
It's been fascinating.

01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:49.563
From first to last, fascinating.

01:32:50.649 --> 01:32:52.733
Oh, don't bother to see me out.
I can find my way.

01:32:52.817 --> 01:32:55.527
Cheerio once more.
And good hunting.

01:33:14.756 --> 01:33:15.756
Ruth?

01:33:19.177 --> 01:33:20.344
Elvira?

01:33:23.348 --> 01:33:24.848
Are you there?

01:33:28.103 --> 01:33:30.229
Yes, I know darn well you are there.

01:33:31.064 --> 01:33:33.774
I just want to tell you there's no use
your hanging around any longer...

01:33:33.858 --> 01:33:35.234
because I'm going away.

01:33:40.532 --> 01:33:42.658
I'm going a long way away.

01:33:47.414 --> 01:33:49.790
Somewhere where I don't believe
you'll be able to follow me.

01:33:49.874 --> 01:33:52.543
I don't believe ghosts
can travel over water.

01:33:53.211 --> 01:33:55.296
Is that quite clear, my darlings?

01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:03.679
You said in one
of your more acid moments, Ruth...

01:34:03.763 --> 01:34:06.390
that I'd been hagridden all my life.

01:34:06.474 --> 01:34:08.225
How right you were.

01:34:08.310 --> 01:34:09.810
But now I'm free, Ruth dear...

01:34:09.894 --> 01:34:12.855
not only of Elvira and Mother
and Mrs. Winthrop-Llewellyn...

01:34:12.939 --> 01:34:14.523
but free of you too.

01:34:14.607 --> 01:34:16.608
And I should like to take
this farewell opportunity...

01:34:16.693 --> 01:34:19.778
of saying that I'm enjoying it immensely.

01:34:23.908 --> 01:34:25.409
Oh. Thank you.

01:34:31.207 --> 01:34:32.439
You were very silly, Elvira,

01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:35.210
to think I didn't know all about
you and Captain Bracegirdle.

01:34:35.295 --> 01:34:36.837
I did.

01:34:36.921 --> 01:34:38.048
And what you didn't
realize was that...

01:34:38.072 --> 01:34:40.924
I was extremely attached to
Paula Westlake at the time.

01:35:10.330 --> 01:35:12.247
Good-bye for the moment, my dears.

01:35:12.332 --> 01:35:14.416
I expect we're bound to meet again
one day, but until we do...

01:35:14.501 --> 01:35:18.003
I'm going to enjoy myself
as I've never enjoyed myself before.
