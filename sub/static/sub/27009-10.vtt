10:20.328 --> 10:22.747
but at the last second
I got off the train,

10:22.830 --> 10:24.915
left him there all alone
and scared with no money

10:24.999 --> 10:27.460
and then I stole his bike. Okay?

10:27.960 --> 10:30.338
Everybody satisfied? God!

10:30.921 --> 10:32.965
-He's going to Pittsburgh?
-No!

10:33.049 --> 10:36.010
They just said on TV that the train
jumped the fucking track

10:36.093 --> 10:38.220
a mile from the station. Happy?

10:38.304 --> 10:40.556
-Oh, my God, it jumped the tracks?
-He'll be okay, honey.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.515
We'll find him.

10:41.599 --> 10:43.100
You're a terrible father...

10:43.601 --> 10:45.936
and your house smells
like a bear pissed in it!

10:46.020 --> 10:48.522
At least I got all my kids, asshole!

10:50.024 --> 10:52.026
[tires screech]

10:53.944 --> 10:57.907
Just tell me the truth, Sweet Pea.
Daddy won't be mad.

10:59.158 --> 11:00.368
Did you kill the boy?

11:00.451 --> 11:02.370
Go shit in your fist, old man.

11:04.580 --> 11:06.374
She scares me, Dad.

11:06.457 --> 11:08.125
She scares me right proper.

11:08.584 --> 11:11.045
[Babe]
This is the thrill of a lifetime, Vic!

11:11.128 --> 11:13.005
I hope we never find Bill!

11:13.089 --> 11:14.548
How you holding up, Holty?

11:14.632 --> 11:20.054
Oh, I never thought I'd say this,
but I think I like trains better.

11:20.137 --> 11:23.140
Well, we'll find Frank's boy
and be back on the ground in no time.

11:23.224 --> 11:24.642
Engaging night vision.

11:24.725 --> 11:25.726
Wow, you got that?

11:25.810 --> 11:27.144
The best money can buy.

11:27.228 --> 11:28.646
[snorts]

11:28.729 --> 11:31.816
Whoo! My spidey senses are tingling now!

11:32.108 --> 11:33.275
You got controls.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.069
What the hell are you doing?

11:35.152 --> 11:35.986
[Vic] Whoo-ee!

11:36.070 --> 11:37.947
[Babe screaming]

11:39.699 --> 11:42.785
Goddamn Bridget.
She's gonna get me killed.

11:43.494 --> 11:44.954
Where the fuck am I?

11:45.037 --> 11:47.998
[creepy music]

11:49.834 --> 11:51.085
Ah!

11:51.168 --> 11:52.712
[growling]

11:53.504 --> 11:54.714
Okay.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.341
Good boy, Foamy.

11:57.425 --> 11:59.051
-[barks]
-[screams]

11:59.635 --> 12:02.430
No, no, no! Bad doggie!

12:02.513 --> 12:03.973
[grunting]

12:04.390 --> 12:05.558
-Ah!
-[yelps]

12:06.183 --> 12:07.810
[groans]

12:08.436 --> 12:10.354
[panting]

12:14.817 --> 12:17.445
You can attack
my economic status all you want,

12:17.528 --> 12:20.281
but the fact of the matter is
our neighborhood needs help,

12:20.364 --> 12:22.783
and I'm the only one offering answers.

12:23.325 --> 12:25.327
-Such as?
-Well, I propose we take

12:25.411 --> 12:28.706
some of the cigarette tax money
that's being spent to promote smoking

12:28.789 --> 12:31.959
and use it to filter the steel slag
out of our water supply.

12:32.209 --> 12:34.754
-[all] You tell him, Rosie!
-[overlapping chatter]

12:34.837 --> 12:36.255
Uh, excuse me?

12:36.338 --> 12:38.174
What you want, kid? A Scotch?

12:38.257 --> 12:39.925
My name is Bill Murphy.

12:40.009 --> 12:43.012
I'm trying to get home, but I'm lost
and I don't have any money.

12:43.095 --> 12:45.514
Oh, shit! Missing white kid?

12:45.598 --> 12:47.433
We got to get the fuck out of here!

12:47.516 --> 12:49.894
[overlapping chatter]

12:49.977 --> 12:51.937
-He's gonna ruin it for all of us!
-But--

12:52.021 --> 12:54.190
Oh, damn, you done went
and touched the bar!

12:54.273 --> 12:55.900
Now your fingerprints are here!

12:56.776 --> 12:57.735
Get out.

12:57.818 --> 12:58.694
Get out!

12:58.778 --> 12:59.737
Ah!

12:59.820 --> 13:02.990
We can't leave a trace.
You know the drill. Get the bleach.

13:03.282 --> 13:05.701
When the fuck did I become the bleach guy?

13:06.452 --> 13:10.414
Why would I put my own car on the tracks?
I had a brand new bag on the window!

13:11.165 --> 13:12.166
Holy shit.

13:12.249 --> 13:13.834
That's Mr. Jerkin's car.

13:14.376 --> 13:15.377
I know who did this.

13:16.420 --> 13:18.464
-Hey!
-Oh, hey, Kevin.

13:18.547 --> 13:20.090
Did you come down to watch the show?

13:20.174 --> 13:21.342
Have you hippies seen my son?

13:21.425 --> 13:23.844
-Hippies. [laughs] What a square.
-Right.

13:23.928 --> 13:25.262
Dad, let me handle it.

13:25.346 --> 13:27.473
I know these guys. They're my friends.

13:27.932 --> 13:28.808
Friends?

13:28.891 --> 13:32.186
Look, guys,
I know we had a falling out, but--

13:32.269 --> 13:33.479
We had a falling out?

13:33.562 --> 13:35.523
We thought you got arrested or something.

13:35.606 --> 13:37.608
Well, I did.

13:37.691 --> 13:40.528
Just 'cause-- Only 'cause they changed
the doors at the liquor store.

13:40.611 --> 13:42.780
Oh, shit, they're catching on.

13:42.863 --> 13:45.074
Look, my brother was on that train.

13:45.616 --> 13:48.118
He's a pain in the balls,
but he's still my brother.

13:48.202 --> 13:50.287
So, if you saw him,
would you just tell me where he went?

13:52.373 --> 13:54.792
Does he have red hair like a scarecrow?

13:54.875 --> 13:57.628
Skin the color of flour?
Slumped shoulders?

13:57.711 --> 13:58.712
Always about to cry?

13:58.796 --> 14:00.506
A look on his face makes you
wanna punch him?

14:00.589 --> 14:02.132
That's my boy!

14:03.425 --> 14:06.095
[distant police siren}

14:08.055 --> 14:10.140
-[car horn honks]
-Out of the street, boy whore!

14:10.224 --> 14:11.642
[screaming]

14:12.977 --> 14:14.895
God damn it! [sobs]

14:18.315 --> 14:19.525
Oh, yes.

14:26.198 --> 14:29.201
Shut the door! Where's your manners?

14:33.455 --> 14:34.331
No!

14:34.415 --> 14:38.419
God damn it, no! No! No!

14:39.962 --> 14:43.340
[guy] Your generation
is gonna ruin this country!

14:43.924 --> 14:45.843
If I'm guilty of anything,

14:45.926 --> 14:49.638
it's of loving
our canine friends too much.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.056
Just one in particular.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.851
And I will not apologize for that.

14:56.645 --> 14:58.939
Powerful. Mr. Roosevelt, your response?

14:59.023 --> 15:01.734
The man had relations
with a damned fire truck Dalmatian.

15:01.817 --> 15:03.068
So you're a dog hater.

15:03.152 --> 15:04.320
I love dogs!

15:04.403 --> 15:07.323
I love pot roast too, but I'm not gonna
stick my Johnson in it.

15:07.406 --> 15:09.074
[all] Oh!

15:09.158 --> 15:13.287
Listen, my opponent has big money
and a political machine behind him.

15:13.370 --> 15:16.206
I know this neighborhood
and I care about it.

15:16.290 --> 15:19.168
[Rosie] I was born here.
I'm a child of this city.

15:19.251 --> 15:22.546
Speaking of children,
let's talk about your illegitimate son.

15:22.630 --> 15:26.008
I was 17.
It was the Puerto Rican Day parade.

15:26.091 --> 15:27.343
Everybody was doing it.

15:27.426 --> 15:28.969
[Rosie] It's just what you did!

15:30.137 --> 15:34.141
Niner-niner, Sierra Hotel, foxtrot,
A-beam, Plast-A-Ware Tower,

15:34.224 --> 15:37.061
delta northbound, one-point-three,
breaker, breaker."

15:37.144 --> 15:39.104
[chuckles]
I don't even know what that shit means!

15:39.188 --> 15:41.190
This thing isn't even plugged in, man!

15:42.024 --> 15:44.193
[Babe] You're gonna get us all killed!

15:44.777 --> 15:46.362
I don't see Bill anywhere.

15:46.445 --> 15:48.322
Keep looking.
Kevin's friends said he went this way.

15:48.405 --> 15:50.282
And how the hell
were those punks your friends?

15:50.741 --> 15:53.369
Whatever happened to zit-stick
and shit-face from your band?

15:53.452 --> 15:54.370
They kicked me out.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.497
They kicked you out?
Why didn't you tell us?

15:56.580 --> 16:01.919
Jesus Christ, I screamed it
into your face about ten fucking times!

16:02.002 --> 16:04.880
But no one ever pays attention
in this family!

16:06.966 --> 16:08.258
Do you kids really think we don't--

16:08.342 --> 16:09.301
Watch the road!

16:09.385 --> 16:11.220
-[horn honks]
-[screaming]

16:11.303 --> 16:12.638
[tires screech]

16:12.721 --> 16:14.348
[crashing]

16:15.099 --> 16:16.725
[Frank] Ah, shit!

16:22.940 --> 16:25.484
Mr. Christ, God...

16:25.901 --> 16:27.111
Uh...

16:27.194 --> 16:29.071
it's been a while.

16:29.154 --> 16:30.864
My name is Bill Murphy.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.742
I was an altar boy last Christmas Eve.

16:34.326 --> 16:38.872
My friend who beats me up tried to steal
chalices from the church vault,

16:39.498 --> 16:41.458
but I hit him with a crucifix.

16:42.209 --> 16:46.171
Thanks for dying on a wooden cross
and not something soft like a cloud.

16:47.297 --> 16:50.426
Look, do you think you could help me out?

16:50.968 --> 16:53.470
A crazy girl really fucked me over

16:53.554 --> 16:57.266
and now I'm lost
and I don't know how to get home.

16:57.891 --> 16:59.101
Please help me.

17:03.981 --> 17:05.983
[angelic sound]

17:07.776 --> 17:09.611
Look, that's Bill.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.572
[Otto] Vic, you found him!

17:12.197 --> 17:15.284
Oh, thank God,
I can get out of this thing now!

17:15.367 --> 17:17.369
Oh, what does
that flashing fuel light mean?

17:17.453 --> 17:18.996
Does that mean we've got a lot of it?

17:19.079 --> 17:21.665
It means I got about five minutes
to get this sucker on the ground.

17:23.751 --> 17:26.837
Unless the light came on five minutes ago
and I was too high to see it.

17:26.920 --> 17:28.338
-[chuckles]
-[alarm beeping]

17:28.422 --> 17:30.466
You're meshuggener!

17:30.549 --> 17:31.759
Ah!

17:32.593 --> 17:34.261
-[screams]
-[clangs]

17:39.433 --> 17:40.768
Ah!

17:40.851 --> 17:42.853
Hey, Bill, your dad sent us!

17:43.228 --> 17:44.229
Glad we could help!

17:44.313 --> 17:46.273
[Babe] You fucking dope fiend!

17:46.356 --> 17:48.358
Does it ever fail?

17:48.901 --> 17:52.279
Mr. Morewill is a scion
of a legendary political family.

17:52.362 --> 17:56.533
Whereas your family values consist
of appearing in a pornographic film

17:56.617 --> 17:58.577
produced by two baggage handlers.

17:58.660 --> 18:00.245
I think he's talking about us!

18:00.329 --> 18:02.831
We're gonna get nominated for a "Fuckie."

18:02.915 --> 18:04.458
I didn't know it was a skin flick!

18:04.541 --> 18:07.211
I just have one scene
as evil Dean Cockstopper

18:07.294 --> 18:08.962
who outlaws the Bonecoming Dance!

18:09.046 --> 18:10.422
They're killing him, Bob.

18:10.506 --> 18:11.924
Shame on them.

18:14.760 --> 18:18.138
I interrupt this debate
with live breaking actual news!

18:18.222 --> 18:19.348
Oh, thank God.

18:19.431 --> 18:21.767
A helicopter has crash-landed
in a storm culvert

18:21.850 --> 18:23.352
in the Meat Repacking District.

18:23.435 --> 18:26.563
According to police, a young boy is
trapped in the water of the culvert

18:26.647 --> 18:29.983
at the corner of 139th Street
and José Jiménez Boulevard.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.401
What does that have to do with us?

18:31.485 --> 18:35.030
You idiot, that's right in the middle
of the ward you want to represent.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.449
I knew that! I was just seeing if you did.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.451
-[all groan]
-[curses in Italian]

18:39.535 --> 18:41.745
Those are our constituents down there,

18:41.829 --> 18:44.164
and they don't need someone
who's gonna sit on their butt.

18:44.248 --> 18:47.501
They need a leader who cares about
their problems and will fight for them!

18:48.669 --> 18:49.962
I'm gonna go help down there!

18:50.045 --> 18:52.047
I daresay this election
just got interesting.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.258
This whole thing is a waste of time.

18:54.341 --> 18:57.678
I took my wedding and funeral suit
out of storage for nothing.

18:57.761 --> 18:58.971
[steam hissing]

19:00.264 --> 19:02.391
I know this looks bad, but we're fine.

19:02.474 --> 19:03.934
Everyone's alive and safe.

19:04.017 --> 19:05.352
My arm hurts really bad.

19:05.435 --> 19:07.646
Why must you challenge me on everything?

19:09.731 --> 19:12.067
We'll call Goomer, he'll pick us up and--

19:12.151 --> 19:14.862
-[Smokey] Hey!
-Don't kill me, I don't have any money!

19:14.945 --> 19:16.947
Hey, I know that giant dick.

19:17.573 --> 19:20.159
Frank Murphy! I thought you was dead.

19:20.701 --> 19:23.036
Smokey! Oh, my God, am I glad to see you!

19:23.120 --> 19:25.164
Hey, the whole family's here.

19:25.247 --> 19:26.623
How's that baby coming?

19:26.707 --> 19:28.834
I ain't got no other reason
for asking y'all that.

19:28.917 --> 19:30.794
Y'all need a lift? Hop in!

19:31.170 --> 19:33.046
[Smokey] What a lucky break I saw you.

19:33.130 --> 19:36.008
I was going down to sell
beer and jerky to the crowd.

19:36.091 --> 19:39.511
They trying to save some stupid
redheaded kid done fell into the culvert

19:39.595 --> 19:40.804
when a helicopter crashed.

19:40.888 --> 19:41.972
That's got to be Bill!

19:42.055 --> 19:43.807
Oh, my God! What if he's hurt?

19:43.891 --> 19:46.185
[chuckles]
I knew that fucking Vic couldn't fly.

19:46.727 --> 19:49.855
This is Jim Jeffords live with
"Dead Kid Watch, '74!"

19:49.938 --> 19:51.190
[tires screech]

19:51.732 --> 19:54.860
My name is Chauncey Roosevelt
and I'm here to help.

19:54.943 --> 19:55.819
[keys clatter]

19:55.903 --> 19:58.739
It's the cream-colored Eldorado.
Park it close.

19:58.822 --> 20:00.782
This shit never ends.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.201
[shouts angrily]

20:02.284 --> 20:04.745
[loudspeaker]  Hang in there, young man.
You're gonna be fine.

20:04.828 --> 20:05.954
So get me out!

20:06.038 --> 20:09.458
We can't yet because
if that exposed wire hits the water,

20:09.541 --> 20:11.043
we could all get electrocuted.

20:11.126 --> 20:14.171
Doesn't water stop electricity
like it does with fire?

20:14.254 --> 20:15.130
Uh...

20:15.214 --> 20:17.090
Yeah, sure. Why not?

20:17.674 --> 20:20.010
I don't want anybody getting hurt
trying to save this one.

20:21.762 --> 20:22.638
Thank you, Smokey.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.014
It's nothing.

20:24.097 --> 20:26.516
Maybe you'll help me find my son some day.

20:27.768 --> 20:31.313
Oh, who am I kidding?
I know where that pink-eyed mummy live.

20:31.396 --> 20:32.272
I love him...

20:32.940 --> 20:36.235
but you ain't supposed
to make a baby you can't look at.

20:36.318 --> 20:37.402
It ain't natural!

20:38.237 --> 20:39.238
[sighs]

20:39.321 --> 20:40.614
Go get your boy.

20:41.156 --> 20:43.242
And don't ever fuck in a laundromat!

20:43.325 --> 20:44.910
Going to get you an albino!

20:45.410 --> 20:47.371
Damn bleach take the color out!

20:47.913 --> 20:49.289
I think my son is down there.

20:49.373 --> 20:50.624
Hi, Mrs. Vanderheim.

20:50.707 --> 20:52.793
Oh, hello, Maureen.

20:52.876 --> 20:54.795
Is Quincy
still coming over to play tomorrow?

20:54.878 --> 20:56.964
Oh, he sure is, sweetheart.

20:57.214 --> 21:00.592
Right after I pick him up from Model UN.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.179
Suck jobs!

21:04.721 --> 21:07.349
Eye contact suck jobs!

21:07.432 --> 21:10.018
-[Sue] Oh, my God, there he is!
-[Frank] That's my son down there.

21:10.852 --> 21:13.563
Bill, we're here! Daddy's gonna save you!

21:14.189 --> 21:16.566
-Go to hell!
-What the fuck did you just say to me?

21:16.650 --> 21:18.527
I'm fucking mad at you!

21:18.610 --> 21:20.237
You don't care about me, Dad!

21:20.737 --> 21:22.281
You never cared about me!

21:22.364 --> 21:23.949
You didn't take me to hockey tryouts

21:24.032 --> 21:27.369
because your stupid fat boss
was eating chocolate in your truck.

21:27.452 --> 21:29.788
A Puerto Rican forced me to do that!

21:29.871 --> 21:32.791
All you ever do is yell at me
and call me a pussy.

21:33.083 --> 21:37.421
A guy exploded in front of me
and you told me to shove it down.

21:37.754 --> 21:41.466
And when I needed you today,
you told me, "Not now."

21:41.550 --> 21:43.593
Well how about now, Dad?

21:44.845 --> 21:47.222
Jesus Christ, he's right.

21:48.015 --> 21:50.517
Son. I'm... I'm sorry.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.645
I have been a terrible father lately.

21:53.729 --> 21:56.606
Your father is very sorry, Bill.

21:56.690 --> 21:58.692
I'm mad at you too, Mom!

21:58.775 --> 21:59.693
What?

21:59.776 --> 22:04.197
You spent all your time with that stupid
scissor-spoon that I cut my fingers on!

22:04.281 --> 22:08.910
It was called the Forkoontula,
and it's still in the development stages,

22:08.994 --> 22:10.746
but you're right.

22:10.829 --> 22:14.207
It's just this new baby coming
really threw us for a loop

22:14.291 --> 22:17.127
and then we got all wrapped up
with the new neighbors.

22:17.210 --> 22:21.256
Well, I guess I ain't
such a bad mother after all.

22:22.132 --> 22:23.467
[slurping]

22:23.550 --> 22:25.010
But that's all over now.

22:25.886 --> 22:26.803
And we're sorry.

22:27.637 --> 22:30.599
I told myself I'd be a better father
than my own dad,

22:31.141 --> 22:32.434
and that starts now.

22:32.976 --> 22:35.937
[Frank] You kids mean--
You mean a lot to me.

22:36.438 --> 22:37.522
[Frank] I love you people.

22:39.024 --> 22:42.778
Just please come on home.
We'll talk about it.

22:42.861 --> 22:44.905
Can I have my old room back to myself?

22:44.988 --> 22:46.198
Of course!

22:46.281 --> 22:48.116
Jesus, Sue, the house is a fucking mess!

22:48.200 --> 22:49.117
-Frank!
-Sure.

22:49.743 --> 22:50.869
Your own room again.

22:50.952 --> 22:52.454
I just want to go home.

22:52.537 --> 22:53.955
Let's save that boy.

22:58.043 --> 22:59.086
Nobody can reach him!

22:59.169 --> 23:02.506
You've inspired me, Rosie! I can do it!

23:02.589 --> 23:05.092
I was a discus thrower in college.

23:05.175 --> 23:06.385

Our aim is off!

23:18.188 --> 23:20.774
And I think Pogo just killed some firemen!

23:20.857 --> 23:23.860
Fuck this.
I'm not afraid of water anymore.

23:23.944 --> 23:25.445
I'm coming for you, Bill!

23:27.948 --> 23:30.283
Son of a bitch! Oh, no! Help!

23:30.367 --> 23:31.785
This pool is moving!

23:31.868 --> 23:33.078
We'll pick you up later!

23:33.161 --> 23:34.579
Christ, these kids are stupid.

23:34.663 --> 23:37.791
We've only got one life preserver left.
We got to make this count!

23:37.874 --> 23:39.626
Let me try! I can do it!

23:39.709 --> 23:40.919
Princess, not now.

23:41.002 --> 23:43.922
I know how to do this!
It's just like ring toss.

23:44.005 --> 23:45.674
Little girl, I don't come to your house

23:45.757 --> 23:48.135
and tell you how to play
with your dolls, do I?

23:48.218 --> 23:49.636
Give me that.

23:49.719 --> 23:51.555
Bill, don't move!

Don't trust the Jews."

Anything is possible.

24:16.121 --> 24:19.207

It's safe to come out now.

I love you, honey.

24:48.111 --> 24:50.155
I love you too, Babe.

24:50.238 --> 24:53.283
And I'll never think of Vic
in the bedroom again.

24:53.366 --> 24:54.326
Aw.

24:54.409 --> 24:55.285
What?

24:56.244 --> 25:02.083
Ginny, I've come to appreciate
how precious every second of life is.

25:02.167 --> 25:04.211
Oh, Otto.

25:04.294 --> 25:07.464
So... get the fuck out of my house.

That was one hell of a parade.

25:15.514 --> 25:16.348
[Sue] Mm-hmm.

25:16.431 --> 25:19.267
You got a third-degree sunburn
and almost killed a kid.

25:19.351 --> 25:22.062
If you read my lips, you can see
I'm calling that kid a cunt.

25:22.145 --> 25:23.480
[laughs]

25:23.563 --> 25:24.856
Am I allowed to say that?

25:24.940 --> 25:26.733
One day when you have
a family of your own.

25:28.401 --> 25:30.487
Thank goodness we're all together.

25:30.779 --> 25:32.155
We got Bill back.

25:32.239 --> 25:34.199
And the Coast Guard
brought us Kevin back.

25:34.282 --> 25:38.203
Yeah, I was pretty scared, but it wasn't
too bad after I passed out.

25:38.662 --> 25:40.830
Well, I know things
got a little crazy this summer.

25:40.914 --> 25:44.042
But now your mom and I...
we got our priorities straight.

25:44.125 --> 25:47.254
Our most important job
is being your parents.

25:47.337 --> 25:50.215
And I swear to you,
we'll never forget that again.

25:50.298 --> 25:51.299
Let's watch more movies!

just pooped everywhere.

this mail been here?
