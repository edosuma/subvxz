00:02.836 --> 00:06.545
My name is Jimmy Novak.
God has chosen me for a higher purpose.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.515
You can never be with your family.

00:08.675 --> 00:11.554
Castiel, promise my family
will be okay and I'll do it.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.852
- Daddy?
- I am not your father.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.575
- Castiel, you took everything from me.
- Who's this girl?

00:17.751 --> 00:20.163
Claire Novak. Claire's troubled.
She needs a father.

00:20.320 --> 00:21.890
She's got issues.
Because of me.

00:22.055 --> 00:24.057
First, I lose my first dad...

00:24.224 --> 00:25.567
...and then I lose my second.

00:26.059 --> 00:29.370
And who killed him and trashed my life?
Dean Winchester.

00:29.530 --> 00:32.409
We'll take care of them,
so they won't bother you anymore.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.239
No!

00:34.401 --> 00:37.211
- Where's your mother?
- She went to go find herself.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.679
You promised, Cass.

00:38.839 --> 00:41.718
I have a responsibility to
help you. - I still gotta go alone.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.513
But I could maybe call sometime.

00:44.745 --> 00:47.419
- Dean's in trouble.
- He's not getting better.

00:47.581 --> 00:50.755
Mother says the Mark is just a curse.
It can be removed.

00:50.918 --> 00:54.229
If there's a cure, we'll do it
and deal with the consequences later.

00:54.388 --> 00:55.560
I can't lose you.

01:10.203 --> 01:11.876
Amelia?

01:15.375 --> 01:16.945
Amelia?

01:17.110 --> 01:18.384
Jimmy?

01:19.112 --> 01:20.819
Jimmy?

01:23.951 --> 01:25.294
Is it you?

01:27.087 --> 01:30.296
Castiel's gone. It's me.

01:32.426 --> 01:36.306
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I never...
- I looked everywhere for you.

01:37.264 --> 01:38.971
I thought I lost you again.

01:41.068 --> 01:42.741
It's okay.

01:42.903 --> 01:44.940
It's okay, Ames.

01:45.472 --> 01:47.145
It's okay.

01:47.474 --> 01:49.476
I'm home now.

01:50.811 --> 01:52.484
What's happening?

01:53.614 --> 01:55.287
How's our girl?

01:55.449 --> 01:56.985
How's Claire?

02:00.754 --> 02:01.824
No.

02:02.489 --> 02:05.800
Not again, no. No.

02:06.159 --> 02:07.866
- No.
- Shh.

02:13.700 --> 02:14.838
Shh.

02:29.282 --> 02:30.693
Shh, shh, shh.

02:34.621 --> 02:37.033
You're safe, Amelia.

02:40.360 --> 02:41.703
You're home.

02:41.895 --> 02:43.033
Amelia?

02:45.666 --> 02:47.339
Amelia?

02:48.468 --> 02:49.538
Jimmy?

02:51.705 --> 02:53.343
Is it you?

02:53.874 --> 02:58.050
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry I left.

02:58.211 --> 02:59.884
I looked everywhere for you.

03:02.549 --> 03:04.722
It's okay, Ames.

03:28.675 --> 03:30.916
I'm gonna catch that train at midnight

03:32.112 --> 03:33.785
I don't care where it's going

03:34.081 --> 03:36.083
The hell you think you're doing in here?

03:37.584 --> 03:41.430
- Come on. It's my birthday tomorrow.
- How old you gonna be, 12?

03:45.692 --> 03:47.603
More like 50.

03:47.761 --> 03:50.935
I'm looking for a guy
named Ronnie Cartwright.

03:51.098 --> 03:52.975
Supposed to be a regular around here.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.973
And my blues keep getting darker

03:59.439 --> 04:03.581
Oh, Lord, I think these
Blues done turned black

04:03.910 --> 04:04.945
Ronnie Cartwright?

04:07.781 --> 04:11.228
Whatever you're selling,
I ain't buying, sweetheart.

04:11.384 --> 04:12.795
I need your help, Ronnie.

04:13.720 --> 04:16.098
I'm trying to track somebody down.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.475
Ain't never seen her before in my life.

04:27.801 --> 04:31.442
Her name's Amelia.
She's been missing for a few years.

04:31.605 --> 04:34.245
But according to her diary,
she was supposed to meet up with you.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.488
- I never met her.
- You were introducing her to a miracle worker.

04:38.645 --> 04:40.989
I don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

04:41.148 --> 04:42.491
I don't know that lady.

04:43.316 --> 04:45.990
And I for damn sure
don't know no miracle worker.

04:46.153 --> 04:48.326
If I did, you think I'd
be in a dump like this?

04:49.089 --> 04:50.591
Now, piss off.

04:50.924 --> 04:52.835
Go back to your Girl Scout troop.

04:53.927 --> 04:55.668
- She's my mother.
- I don't care.

04:56.163 --> 05:00.009
- Can you just take another look'? Maybe...
- I told you I ain't never seen her before.

05:01.668 --> 05:03.477
And I better never see you again.

05:24.324 --> 05:27.999
- I told you to stay away from me.
- You were the last person to speak to my mom.

05:28.161 --> 05:31.665
- I need to find her.
- I don't know Amelia Novak. You got it?

05:33.533 --> 05:35.513
I never told you her last name.

05:38.471 --> 05:41.247
Wait. Unh!

05:43.844 --> 05:45.721
Come on.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.501
911, what is your emergency?

06:04.664 --> 06:10.171
Oh, yeah. I found some girl passed out
in the alley by Susie's Bar on Overland.

06:10.337 --> 06:12.214
We'll send an ambulance right away, sir.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.875
Can you tell me if she's still breathing?

06:41.935 --> 06:43.710
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah, of course.

06:43.870 --> 06:47.875
We're glad to help, but Claire and I aren't
on the best of terms. Should I be here?

06:49.276 --> 06:51.779
I need help from both of you.
You were troubled teens.

06:51.945 --> 06:54.255
- You speak her language.
- All right.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.950
How is she?

06:56.950 --> 07:00.295
I haven't gone in yet.
I was waiting for backup.

07:01.288 --> 07:02.926
"Backup."

07:04.891 --> 07:07.804
Three men and a lady. Let's do this.

07:12.565 --> 07:13.805
What are you doing here?

07:16.303 --> 07:17.976
And why the hell did you bring him?

07:18.171 --> 07:19.980
Awesome.

07:21.341 --> 07:25.585
Um, the police found my number
in your emergency contact list.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.451
Yeah, well, that was a mistake.

07:30.617 --> 07:31.687
You can go now.

07:35.322 --> 07:37.097
Claire...

07:37.424 --> 07:38.801
...why were you at a bar?

07:39.492 --> 07:40.630
I wasn't.

07:40.994 --> 07:44.942
Claire, what were you doing in an alley
outside of a bar?

07:45.265 --> 07:48.337
Wrong place, wrong time. Story of my life.

07:48.501 --> 07:52.506
Look, we're not leaving until you tell us
what the hell really happened.

07:53.707 --> 07:54.947
So if you want us gone...

07:56.343 --> 07:57.481
...talk.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.492
I was looking for my mom.

08:03.683 --> 08:07.290
I wanna find my mom
and tell her she ruined my life.

08:08.355 --> 08:10.494
- Your mom didn't...
- She left me.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.034
And so did my dad.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.797
But Jimmy's gone, right?

08:14.961 --> 08:16.668
Has it easy up in heaven?

08:16.830 --> 08:20.801
So Mom's the only one left I can tell off.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.715
When's the last anybody heard
from your mom?

08:26.906 --> 08:28.180
Um...

08:28.875 --> 08:33.346
When I was living with my grandmother,
she used to send me postcards.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.388
This is the last one.

08:38.150 --> 08:40.062
I got it just before my grandma died.

08:41.388 --> 08:44.392
Two years ago.
Nobody's heard from her since.

08:45.859 --> 08:49.568
It was sent from a motel here in town.
That's where I've been crashing.

08:49.763 --> 08:53.336
I was at Susie's Bar looking for
a loser named Ronnie Cartwright.

08:53.833 --> 08:57.406
Mom's diary said she was gonna meet him
around the time she disappeared.

08:57.570 --> 09:02.019
Before he knocked me down, he...
He remembered her name.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.585
He knows something.

09:04.244 --> 09:05.746
Why was Amelia looking for him?

09:07.414 --> 09:08.916
She went looking for miracles.

09:11.918 --> 09:13.420
She went looking for you.

09:19.926 --> 09:22.099
This is all my fault.

09:22.262 --> 09:25.243
You know, Cass, say it is.
What can you do about it?

09:26.099 --> 09:29.103
- Find Amelia?
- She disappeared trying to hunt down an angel.

09:29.269 --> 09:30.942
- Might be a case.
- We don't know that.

09:31.104 --> 09:34.415
Close enough. Come on.
Give me something to punch already.

09:36.776 --> 09:40.121
Kidding. I'm fine. I'm just... I'm fine.

09:40.313 --> 09:43.624
Why don't we go back to the bar,
see if we can't track down Ronnie, huh?

09:43.817 --> 09:46.798
- We should let Claire know
we're going first. Perfect.

09:50.323 --> 09:51.734
Hey.

09:52.325 --> 09:55.568
Damn it. - She either went
looking for Ronnie again, or...

09:55.728 --> 09:58.971
Yeah, or she went to go grab her stuff
before taking off again.

09:59.132 --> 10:02.409
She's got a concussion.
Maybe that'll slow her down.

10:03.336 --> 10:06.840
All right. I'll head to the motel.
You'll check out the bar.

10:09.342 --> 10:13.654
Hey, Cass, listen. What you're doing for
Claire, helping her find her mom...

10:14.347 --> 10:16.827
...it's good. it's a good thing.

10:16.983 --> 10:20.157
- But?
- Well, where does it end?

10:20.487 --> 10:23.093
I'm not trying to be a
dick, but the truth is...

10:23.256 --> 10:25.167
...you're not her dad.

10:25.358 --> 10:29.500
In fact, you're not anything to her except
a constant reminder of someone that's gone.

10:30.330 --> 10:34.472
No, I'm responsible for everything
that's happened to her.

10:35.468 --> 10:38.847
I'm just saying, she's been surviving
on her own for quite a while now...

10:39.005 --> 10:42.817
...and I think partly because
she doesn't have anybody to answer to.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.284
You know, there's...

10:44.477 --> 10:48.391
- There's nobody holding her back.
- We just found her in a hospital.

10:48.615 --> 10:51.027
You telling me
that she'd be better off on her own?

10:51.451 --> 10:54.455
I'm saying she might be stronger
on her own.

11:04.130 --> 11:09.079
You like when I take you shopping
For all the pretty things I do

11:10.803 --> 11:14.148
What's the rush, huh?
Heading out to beat down another teenager?

11:15.508 --> 11:17.818
That bitch attacked me.

11:17.977 --> 11:19.888
Poor choice of words, pal.

11:20.046 --> 11:22.549
Now, Amelia Novak, where is she'?

11:22.715 --> 11:24.058
- Unh.
- No?

11:25.852 --> 11:27.889
- Dean.
- Listen, Ronnie, what do you say, huh'?

11:28.054 --> 11:32.002
We could do this all day. Unless you wanna
tell me everything you know about Amelia.

11:32.158 --> 11:33.899
Okay. Okay.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.063
Okay.

11:36.729 --> 11:38.538
I met Amelia.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.405
But she was the last one. I swear.

11:40.567 --> 11:42.069
The last one of what?

11:43.503 --> 11:46.575
I worked for a faith healer.

11:46.873 --> 11:48.546
No, he was the real deal.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.689
Hey, I was blind, and he healed me.

11:52.412 --> 11:53.914
Give us a name.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.923
- Now.
- Peter Holloway.

11:56.082 --> 11:57.584
Okay.

11:57.750 --> 12:00.754
Yeah, after he gave me my sight back, I...

12:00.920 --> 12:03.594
Well, he made me work for him, as payment.

12:04.924 --> 12:07.063
I recruited candidates.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.867
He had a specific type.

12:10.363 --> 12:11.706
Young, but, uh...

12:12.432 --> 12:14.275
...lost.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.071
Wouldn't be missed.

12:16.603 --> 12:19.106
And Amelia was one of these candidates?

12:20.039 --> 12:21.712
Some people he healed.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.778
But others, he...

12:24.978 --> 12:26.719
Look, man.

12:27.113 --> 12:30.993
Look, I saw him one night.
It looked like he was, uh...

12:31.884 --> 12:34.626
I don't know how to describe it,
but he was...

12:34.787 --> 12:37.267
He'd tied one of them up...

12:37.790 --> 12:39.895
...and he was, uh...

12:40.059 --> 12:41.766
...cutting on them.

12:43.630 --> 12:47.100
Look, after that I was done, okay? I quit.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.747
Haven't heard from Holloway since.

13:06.152 --> 13:07.495
Took you long enough.

13:10.523 --> 13:12.264
How did you...?

13:12.659 --> 13:15.003
Also, you checked in
under the name Claire Novak.

13:15.161 --> 13:18.768
Use an alias.

13:19.165 --> 13:20.610
Okay.

13:23.836 --> 13:25.440
Claire, we just wanna help.

13:26.172 --> 13:27.810
I didn't ask for your help.

13:30.043 --> 13:33.183
You know, this is good. I was impressed.

13:33.613 --> 13:35.820
How did you get the information that...?

13:36.616 --> 13:39.620
It's mostly empty promises and regret...

13:39.786 --> 13:42.289
...but there were enough bread crumbs
to get me here.

13:44.657 --> 13:47.160
How did you get your mom's diary?

13:47.327 --> 13:51.571
The motel manager sent Mom's stuff to her
last-known address after she disappeared.

13:52.198 --> 13:55.702
It bounced around. Eventually found its way
to me at one of the foster homes.

13:56.636 --> 13:58.843
You came all this way just to tell her off?

13:59.706 --> 14:01.344
You always get along with your mom?

14:01.507 --> 14:05.387
Never got the chance to find out.
My mom died when I was a baby.

14:07.513 --> 14:11.893
- Um... I'm sorry. I didn't... - No, it's
okay. I got to know her later in life.

14:12.051 --> 14:15.498
And, yeah, I suppose we got along okay.

14:16.222 --> 14:18.031
What?

14:18.391 --> 14:21.531
In this line of work,
death isn't always goodbye.

14:23.096 --> 14:26.600
Well, this is different. My mom left me.

14:31.237 --> 14:34.582
"Claire, I'll be home soon.

14:34.741 --> 14:36.846
We'll be home soon."

14:37.009 --> 14:39.717
Doesn't sound like somebody
who wanted to abandon you.

14:40.747 --> 14:43.921
- Did you check her credit cards?
- They wouldn't send me her records.

14:44.083 --> 14:47.064
Okay, I know you need to be
somewhere far away from all of us...

14:47.220 --> 14:51.100
...but let me get my laptop, I'll teach you
how to hack into her credit-card records.

14:51.257 --> 14:53.863
It'll help you get a lead on your mom.

14:54.761 --> 14:57.401
Show me. But then I'm gone.

15:09.575 --> 15:14.081
Hey, listen. I don't think
these guys snooping around are FBI.

15:14.247 --> 15:17.387
- No, I think they're...
- They're hunters.

15:18.651 --> 15:21.632
I'm sorry.
I wanted to give you the heads-up.

15:21.788 --> 15:24.598
I wouldn't need a heads-up
if you'd kept your mouth shut.

15:24.757 --> 15:27.067
Hey, come on.

15:27.627 --> 15:28.799
Don't you see that?

15:28.961 --> 15:31.305
Come on. No, man...

15:31.464 --> 15:33.603
My eyes. Come on, man.

15:33.966 --> 15:35.604
I can't see.

15:53.986 --> 15:55.659
There we go.

15:55.822 --> 15:57.859
Seriously? It's that easy?

15:58.324 --> 16:00.998
Yes. I can also show you
how to set up fake credit cards.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.970
It will make life on the road a lot easier.

16:04.130 --> 16:08.169
- You guys are credit-card scammers too?
- Hunting monsters doesn't exactly pay the bills.

16:08.334 --> 16:09.506
Then why do you do it?

16:10.770 --> 16:12.681
To help people. Make a difference.

16:13.873 --> 16:15.682
That's it?

16:16.509 --> 16:17.817
That's not enough?

16:23.182 --> 16:27.324
- Are you all right?
- I will be when nobody ever asks me that again.

16:27.687 --> 16:30.497
- You guys find Ronnie?
- Yeah. Yeah, he gave up a name.

16:30.656 --> 16:34.536
- Peter Holloway. He said he was a faith healer.
- So, what, you thinking angel?

16:34.694 --> 16:38.699
Maybe. By the sound of it, he has healed
some people, but he may have fed off others.

16:38.865 --> 16:40.674
Yeah, that's weird.

16:40.867 --> 16:44.542
All right,
let's look into this Peter Holloway guy.

16:45.705 --> 16:47.343
Claire, um...

16:47.707 --> 16:48.879
...happy birthday.

16:51.077 --> 16:52.420
Um...

16:57.884 --> 16:59.386
I got it at the Hot Topical.

17:01.721 --> 17:03.394
Right. Um...

17:03.689 --> 17:05.099
Thanks, I guess.

17:08.426 --> 17:09.598
Whoa.

17:09.862 --> 17:13.036
Just got an alert from local P.D.

17:13.199 --> 17:17.579
- Ronnie's body was found outside Susie's Bar.
- You were just supposed to talk to Ronnie.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.910
- What did you do?
- I didn't lay a hand on him.

17:20.071 --> 17:23.541
- Dean, that isn't exactly true.
- Well, I didn't kill the guy.

17:27.413 --> 17:29.415
I'm gonna get suited up and head back over.

17:29.582 --> 17:32.426
- I'm coming with you.
- I'm coming with you too.

17:35.388 --> 17:38.926
- You wanna get in on this?
- No, I should stay here and research Holloway.

17:40.359 --> 17:41.929
Great.

17:45.097 --> 17:46.576
Hey, Cass?

17:48.434 --> 17:49.606
What happened in the bar?

17:51.270 --> 17:52.647
Dean snapped.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.475
He's getting worse.

18:01.781 --> 18:02.987
Officer.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.294
Agents Clapton and Page.

18:07.653 --> 18:09.758
- And your little friend?
- Oh, uh...

18:09.956 --> 18:12.459
it's Bring Your Daughter to Work Day
at the bureau.

18:13.326 --> 18:16.796
Uh, vic was a, uh, person of interest
in a missing-persons case.

18:16.963 --> 18:18.465
What do you got?

18:19.265 --> 18:20.300
Stab wound.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.606
Clean through.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.179
No sign of robbery.

18:24.403 --> 18:27.179
Wallet and everything
was still on his person.

18:27.673 --> 18:30.517
What are the red marks there
on the point of entry?

18:30.676 --> 18:32.986
Burn marks, maybe. Don't know.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.319
We pulled his cell-phone records.

18:35.481 --> 18:38.325
He made two calls to the same number
prior to the attack.

18:38.484 --> 18:40.760
We tried the number, but the line's
dead now. Probably a burner.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.692
- Will you excuse me?
- Yeah.

18:44.924 --> 18:46.369
Sheriff Coltrane.

18:46.525 --> 18:50.200
The wound looks like an Angel Blade,
but the point of entry is wider.

18:50.529 --> 18:52.509
I can't explain those marks.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.668
It's the best birthday ever.

18:55.201 --> 18:57.181
Okay, all right. Come on.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.213
Hey. I, uh, got a lead on Peter Holloway.

19:05.444 --> 19:07.822
Oh, good, because he's probably
about to split town.

19:07.980 --> 19:11.018
Ronnie made a few phone calls
before he got shish-kebabed.

19:11.217 --> 19:14.892
- You think he gave Holloway a heads-up?
- If he did, that's what got him killed.

19:15.054 --> 19:16.897
We gotta track him down before he bails.

19:17.056 --> 19:18.831
Great. According to county records...

19:18.991 --> 19:21.733
...Holloway owns a farmhouse
about 30 or 40 miles from here.

19:21.961 --> 19:25.033
So I cross-referenced it
with Amelia's credit-card receipts.

19:25.197 --> 19:26.699
The house is about right there.

19:26.866 --> 19:30.245
She's been hitting up Biggersons
and Gas-N-Sips all around the area.

19:30.469 --> 19:32.210
- Probably staking the place out.
- Exactly.

19:32.371 --> 19:35.375
- What are we waiting for? Let's go.
- You're not going out there.

19:35.541 --> 19:38.078
- She's my mother.
- That house could be empty and a trap.

19:38.244 --> 19:40.884
It's too dangerous.
I can't let anything happen to you.

19:41.047 --> 19:43.220
- Anything else, you mean.
- You're not going.

19:43.382 --> 19:44.759
You're not either, Dean.

19:45.217 --> 19:47.197
- What?
- Back at the bar, with Ronnie...

19:47.353 --> 19:50.095
Oh, come on, Cass.
He wasn't gonna talk. I just...

19:50.356 --> 19:51.562
...helped him talk.

19:51.757 --> 19:53.566
Dean, Cass is right.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.768
We need to keep the Mark in check.

19:56.996 --> 20:00.239
And we don't know what's out there.
You know, maybe you should...

20:01.000 --> 20:02.411
Maybe you should stay here.

20:02.568 --> 20:05.071
So you wanna bench me again?

20:09.875 --> 20:11.047
Hmmph.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.216
All right, fine.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.620
I'll stay and babysit...

20:16.115 --> 20:18.254
...but if anything
happens, anything at all...

20:18.417 --> 20:20.419
Yeah, we'll call you. No fighting.

20:20.586 --> 20:22.031
Yeah, tell her that.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.598
Both of you.

20:29.962 --> 20:31.305
Aaahhh.

20:36.736 --> 20:37.771
Can I have one?

20:41.040 --> 20:44.419
Like you never had a beer
before you were 21.

20:47.613 --> 20:52.084
All right, you know what? If we stay cooped up
in this room all night, I'm gonna lose my mind.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.458
You already have.

20:54.620 --> 20:55.792
Oh, ha-ha-ha.

20:56.055 --> 20:57.659
Come on.

20:58.457 --> 20:59.936
Let's go.

21:09.969 --> 21:12.108
When this is over...

21:12.471 --> 21:14.314
...should I...?

21:15.107 --> 21:16.814
Should I leave Claire alone?

21:17.076 --> 21:19.579
What? No, man. She's family.

21:19.779 --> 21:23.420
Well, I mean, she's not exactly family,
but she's close enough.

21:23.616 --> 21:26.119
I mean, you two have history.
Simple as that.

21:26.619 --> 21:29.759
So you don'! think
she's better off on her own?

21:29.922 --> 21:31.765
Cass, she just turned 18.

21:31.924 --> 21:35.963
Well, you were alone when you left for
college at that age, weren't you?

21:36.128 --> 21:37.937
Yeah, but that's different.

21:38.430 --> 21:39.670
How, Sam?

21:39.832 --> 21:43.837
Look, here's all I know.
Going it alone, that's no way to live.

21:44.770 --> 21:48.775
You being there for her, even if she thinks
she doesn't want you to be there for her...

21:48.941 --> 21:50.818
...that's good. For both of you.

21:52.511 --> 21:54.354
Maybe. In the end.

21:57.349 --> 21:58.953
In the end.

22:06.992 --> 22:12.135
"It's in the hole. It's in the hole."

22:14.133 --> 22:16.204
Bill Murray?

22:16.969 --> 22:18.039
Caddyshack.

22:20.206 --> 22:22.880
- It's a classic.
- Never seen it. Not a fan.

22:23.676 --> 22:24.711
How dare you?

22:25.578 --> 22:27.148
- You done?
- Yeah, I'm done.

22:28.214 --> 22:31.093
I'm done with your whole generation.

22:38.657 --> 22:42.503
"Did you-J? Did you see that?
Did that go in the hole?

22:42.661 --> 22:46.165
- I wasn't watching. Did the ball go in...?"
- Happy Gilmore. Well played.

22:46.332 --> 22:48.505
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.412
"Did it go in? Did that go in?"

22:57.343 --> 22:58.879
It looks abandoned.

22:59.044 --> 23:01.388
Only one way to find out.

23:02.548 --> 23:04.255
This is what you guys do?

23:04.416 --> 23:07.761
Stay at cheap motels, steal credit cards...

23:09.021 --> 23:10.432
...play mini-golf?

23:10.923 --> 23:11.924
Huh.

23:12.258 --> 23:15.102
Actually, we haven't played
mini-golf in a while...

23:15.261 --> 23:17.901
...but, uh, yeah...

23:18.731 --> 23:20.404
...that about sums it up.

23:21.767 --> 23:24.247
You take the barn, I'll take the house.

23:27.239 --> 23:30.880
We help people. At least we try to.

23:31.076 --> 23:34.285
Like, uh, Castiel helped my dad?

23:35.948 --> 23:37.723
Claire, what happened to your dad...

23:37.883 --> 23:40.386
I'm sorry, okay? I really am.

23:40.552 --> 23:43.897
But, uh, there's something you gotta know.

23:44.290 --> 23:46.463
Your dad's sacrifice was not meaningless.

23:47.226 --> 23:50.298
Okay, he gave up his body, his vessel.

23:50.562 --> 23:52.473
And because he did that, Cass...

23:52.631 --> 23:54.304
Cass was able to save the world.

23:55.567 --> 23:56.910
The world.

23:57.403 --> 23:59.576
Your father's a hero.

23:59.772 --> 24:01.581
He did not die in vain.

24:16.488 --> 24:18.297
Last hole.

24:18.457 --> 24:19.993
Already?

24:20.192 --> 24:22.172
Yeah. See?

24:22.328 --> 24:24.501
They take your ball on the last one.

24:24.663 --> 24:26.165
Drop it in the bottom like so.

24:36.942 --> 24:38.819
Are you okay?

24:38.978 --> 24:40.719
You're not stroking out, are you?

24:43.349 --> 24:45.022
The red marks.

24:45.184 --> 24:46.857
What red marks?

24:48.320 --> 24:50.800
Claire, you're a genius. Come on, let's go.

24:50.956 --> 24:54.301
What? Wait. Why am I a genius?

24:58.964 --> 25:02.343
So this is hunting? Homework?

25:02.501 --> 25:04.503
Ronnie's wound
looked like an Angel Blade...

25:04.670 --> 25:07.651
...but the red marks didn't match up
with an Angel Blade.

25:07.806 --> 25:11.720
If it was an Angel Sword, that would explain
the size of the wound and the red marks.

25:11.877 --> 25:16.155
Because a sword would have a hilt on it
which could cause the... The marks.

25:17.816 --> 25:19.261
You got all that from a putter?

25:45.744 --> 25:47.724
Is...? Is this what you mean?

25:52.518 --> 25:53.792
Grigori.

25:55.788 --> 25:57.927
The Watcher Angels.

25:59.024 --> 26:00.526
So are they good or bad?

26:00.692 --> 26:03.070
Well, some of the lore says
that they, uh, help people...

26:03.228 --> 26:07.074
...and some says that they prey on people,
so keep digging.

26:13.205 --> 26:15.207
Amelia.

26:15.374 --> 26:16.409
Jimmy?

26:18.444 --> 26:20.617
Jim...? Jimmy.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.115
Amelia.

26:26.952 --> 26:27.953
Jimmy.

26:29.455 --> 26:31.799
- Amelia. it's okay.
- I looked everywhere for you.

26:32.257 --> 26:34.396
- It's okay.
- I tried to find you.

26:34.593 --> 26:38.131
- You attacked my husband.
- It's okay. It's okay.

27:04.256 --> 27:06.759
Cass isn't answering his phone either.

27:07.126 --> 27:09.970
I don't understand.
Grigori Angels went rogue?

27:10.129 --> 27:13.372
- Started feeding on people? Why?
- Don't know. Don't care.

27:13.599 --> 27:16.603
I'm heading over to Holloway's
to end that son of a bitch.

27:16.768 --> 27:19.374
Let me guess, you want me to stay here?

27:33.652 --> 27:36.462
Happy birthday. Don't shoot me.

27:39.324 --> 27:40.701
Let's go.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.518
I'm sorry.

27:59.545 --> 28:02.992
I'm usually able to heal
any wound, you're...

28:03.215 --> 28:05.217
I was dreaming.

28:06.418 --> 28:09.729
This whole time I was dreaming...

28:10.422 --> 28:15.235
...of finding Jimmy,
of putting my family back together.

28:17.062 --> 28:20.373
You're not him anymore. I can tell.

28:21.233 --> 28:23.076
No.

28:26.939 --> 28:29.579
Where's Jimmy?

28:30.576 --> 28:33.386
Your husband is in heaven.

28:43.755 --> 28:47.225
Amelia, I promised to
protect your family...

28:47.426 --> 28:49.599
...and I failed.

28:49.761 --> 28:52.105
Not if Claire's alive.
She's all that matters.

28:52.264 --> 28:54.767
Claire is alive.

28:56.201 --> 28:58.738
She's grown up to be
a very strong-willed young woman.

28:58.904 --> 29:00.906
That's my girl.

29:01.373 --> 29:03.444
I just should... I shouldn't have left her.

29:03.609 --> 29:07.716
I just thought if I could find Jimmy,
I would make everything right.

29:07.879 --> 29:10.086
But I should have never left her.
I shouldn't...

29:11.550 --> 29:12.654
It's okay.

29:34.806 --> 29:36.615
So you must be Holloway.

29:38.510 --> 29:42.822
For the last 50 years or so, yes.

29:43.148 --> 29:45.754
Before that I was a Jenkins.

29:46.418 --> 29:48.921
And before that, a Miller.

29:49.321 --> 29:51.323
My real name is Tamiel.

29:52.090 --> 29:55.799
I'm a Grigori. A Watcher Angel.

29:56.328 --> 29:58.672
Since when do angels feed on humans?

29:58.830 --> 30:00.275
Since the dawn of man.

30:00.999 --> 30:02.342
What are you talking about?

30:03.835 --> 30:06.509
Your souls...

30:06.672 --> 30:10.142
...are little slices of heaven...

30:10.842 --> 30:13.686
...that are, if properly kept...

30:13.845 --> 30:18.521
...delicious meals that
can last for years...

30:18.684 --> 30:21.494
...decades even.

30:21.953 --> 30:23.193
You're not an angel.

30:23.855 --> 30:25.892
- You're a monster.
- Ha-ha-ha.

30:28.527 --> 30:29.699
Aaahhh.

30:29.861 --> 30:33.138
I prefer to think of myself as a gourmand.

30:33.832 --> 30:36.540
I make heaven a place on earth.

30:36.702 --> 30:40.844
Keeps me alive and hidden
from the rest of the failures...

30:41.039 --> 30:42.575
...that call themselves angels.

30:43.141 --> 30:44.176
Uh.

30:44.376 --> 30:48.688
Oh, they are failures? Yeah, because
you're living so large on your own, right?

30:50.515 --> 30:53.086
There were hundreds of us.

30:54.486 --> 30:56.397
But now...

30:57.989 --> 31:01.732
Each of our names inscribed on our swords.

31:01.893 --> 31:06.706
A brotherhood of
perfectly crafted engineered beings...

31:06.865 --> 31:13.009
...sent to protect you pathetic,
bottom-feeding disasters.

31:27.052 --> 31:30.033
All right, let's stick together.
First the barn, then the house.

31:30.188 --> 31:32.031
If you have to shoot, aim for the chest.

31:32.190 --> 31:35.763
It won't drop an angel,
but it'll slow him down. You got it'?

31:35.927 --> 31:37.270
Yeah.

31:40.031 --> 31:41.908
Are they...?

31:42.534 --> 31:45.743
I don't know. We will get them help.

31:49.775 --> 31:53.086
- How long have I been like this?
- Two years.

32:19.971 --> 32:21.678
Dean.

32:27.179 --> 32:28.317
Claire?

32:28.947 --> 32:30.824
I'm so sorry.

32:31.316 --> 32:34.820
Baby, I'm so sorry.

32:35.654 --> 32:37.998
I'm so sorry.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.698
It's okay.

32:44.262 --> 32:45.605
Let's go find Sam.

32:46.198 --> 32:49.179
Claire. Hey, listen to me.

32:49.334 --> 32:51.780
Stay here, okay? Do not move.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.813
Okay. Thank you.

32:54.840 --> 32:56.513
Thank you both.

32:58.810 --> 33:01.313
- Hey. Hey.
- Mom. Mommy.

33:18.797 --> 33:20.708
Cass.

33:28.373 --> 33:29.716
What the hell happened?

33:29.875 --> 33:32.219
- Listen, Holloway is a Grigori.
- A Grigori.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.149
- Grigori?
- Yes.

33:34.312 --> 33:36.690
No. They were some of
the first angels on Earth.

33:36.848 --> 33:40.523
It was an elite unit that went bad,
but they're extinct, they were destroyed.

33:40.685 --> 33:43.063
No, some survived.
And they've been hunting humans...

33:43.255 --> 33:46.327
...making them create heavens in
their minds and feeding off them.

33:46.491 --> 33:47.868
Where is this abomination?

33:48.026 --> 33:50.506
I don't know. I looked everywhere.
He must have left.

33:57.903 --> 34:00.907
Mom. Come on, Mom,
you have to stay with me, okay?

34:01.072 --> 34:03.552
Come on, stand up.
Mom, it's gonna be okay.

34:04.910 --> 34:06.583
Okay. Okay.

34:06.778 --> 34:11.284
- Thank you, sweetheart.
- You know there's no fixing her, right?

34:24.896 --> 34:27.103
You really think...

34:27.299 --> 34:30.576
...that's gonna hurt an angel of the Lord?

34:31.902 --> 34:33.210
No!

34:35.407 --> 34:37.045
Mom. Mom.

34:38.909 --> 34:40.446
Mom.

34:49.054 --> 34:50.397
No!

35:41.606 --> 35:44.018
Mom. Mom, please stay with me, okay?

35:44.275 --> 35:47.882
Mom? Mom, Mom, Mom.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.628
Mom.

35:55.120 --> 35:56.531
I'm sorry.

35:59.357 --> 36:01.701
I'm so sorry.

36:02.827 --> 36:05.000
I'm so sorry.

36:21.713 --> 36:23.056
Amelia.

36:24.215 --> 36:25.523
Amelia.

36:25.817 --> 36:27.228
Jimmy.

36:27.419 --> 36:29.558
Is it really you?

36:37.062 --> 36:39.008
Is this...?

36:40.231 --> 36:42.233
It's heaven, heh.

36:43.034 --> 36:46.743
I've waited for you for so long, I...

36:47.739 --> 36:49.946
How is she?

36:50.341 --> 36:52.878
- How's Claire?
- Oh, Jimmy.

36:53.044 --> 36:55.183
She grew up so beautiful.

36:55.380 --> 36:57.519
She's so strong.

36:59.084 --> 37:01.189
Like her mom.

37:02.587 --> 37:06.433
- I love you.
- I love you too.

37:19.637 --> 37:23.813
So, what, this is some sort of
halfway house for wayward girls?

37:23.975 --> 37:26.615
Huh. No, not at all.

37:26.778 --> 37:32.251
Jody Mills is good people. And she'll give you a
place to crash until you get back on your feet.

37:32.417 --> 37:34.954
It's not forever, you know?

37:38.123 --> 37:40.569
What are you gonna do about Claire?

37:40.925 --> 37:43.064
It's not up to me.

37:44.462 --> 37:48.774
You said sometimes
death isn't always goodbye, right?

37:49.567 --> 37:51.638
So goodbyes aren't always forever.

37:53.304 --> 37:54.840
Right.

37:55.140 --> 37:56.642
Take care of yourself, Claire.

38:14.592 --> 38:17.664
I felt bad about taking the gun back, so...

38:21.166 --> 38:23.646
- Heh, heh.
- Thanks.

38:25.970 --> 38:28.678
But I don't think I'm interested
in any more homework.

38:30.041 --> 38:31.111
Huh.

38:39.851 --> 38:42.661
Did you honestly think
I didn't see you take this?

38:50.728 --> 38:51.866
Really?

38:53.364 --> 38:55.844
I'll just put this in here.

38:57.202 --> 38:59.148
You know, Claire...

39:00.171 --> 39:01.741
...you already got your revenge.

39:03.374 --> 39:06.218
You go down this path, our path...

39:06.845 --> 39:08.222
...it's not a long life.

39:10.415 --> 39:12.861
I don't know. You seem pretty old.

39:13.818 --> 39:14.853
Thanks.

39:17.388 --> 39:18.890
Listen...

39:19.724 --> 39:22.204
...what I did, setting you up...

39:22.727 --> 39:26.436
- I'm sorry. I just... I shouldn't...
- Forget it. it's in the past.

39:31.236 --> 39:34.376
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Me?

39:35.940 --> 39:37.419
I don't know.

39:38.743 --> 39:41.121
But I will keep fighting.

39:41.279 --> 39:44.089
I'll keep swinging until
I got nothing left.

39:49.454 --> 39:51.934
Will you keep an eye on him?

39:54.559 --> 39:56.061
He's been through enough.

39:57.695 --> 39:58.935
So have you.

40:01.432 --> 40:04.311
Claire, do your homework
before you do anything stupid, okay?

40:06.271 --> 40:09.775
And we're here if you need us. Anytime.

40:13.611 --> 40:15.750
I'll get you loaded up.

40:23.288 --> 40:25.234
Claire.

40:27.325 --> 40:32.468
If you, um... If you need
anything, ever, I...

40:32.630 --> 40:34.473
I just wanted you to know that...

40:59.991 --> 41:03.302
Someone just tell me she's gonna be okay.

41:04.629 --> 41:06.506
Yeah, Cass, of course.

41:06.764 --> 41:08.505
She'll be okay.

41:09.534 --> 41:11.343
So will you.

41:13.638 --> 41:15.709
Going home or leaving home?

41:15.873 --> 41:18.854
Just going.
