02:31.175 --> 02:34.770
[Birds chattering and hooting]

02:35.175 --> 02:39.965
<i>[Narrator] Many strange legends</i>
<i>are told of these jungles of India,</i>

02:40.055 --> 02:44.606
<i>but none so strange as the story</i>
<i>of a small boy named Mowgli.</i>

02:47.015 --> 02:49.927
<i>It all began when the silence</i>
<i>of the jungle was broken</i>

02:50.015 --> 02:51.368
<i>by an unfamiliar sound.</i>

02:51.455 --> 02:55.164
[Baby crying]

02:56.455 --> 02:59.333
<i>It was a sound like</i>
<i>one never heard before</i>

02:59.415 --> 03:01.167
<i>in this part of the jungle.</i>

03:01.255 --> 03:04.008
[Crying continues]

03:06.575 --> 03:09.487
<i>It was a man cub!</i>

03:09.575 --> 03:12.294
<i>Had I known how deeply</i>
<i>I was to be involved,</i>

03:12.375 --> 03:15.173
<i>I would've obeyed</i>
<i>my first impulse and walked away.</i>

03:15.255 --> 03:17.974
[Baby laughing, cooing]

03:22.615 --> 03:26.051
[Cooing and laughing]

03:26.135 --> 03:29.207
<i>This man cub would have</i>
<i>to have nourishment, and soon.</i>

03:29.295 --> 03:31.968
<i>It was many days' travel</i>
<i>to the nearest man-village,</i>

03:32.055 --> 03:34.774
<i>and without a mother's care,</i>
<i>he would soon perish.</i>

03:34.855 --> 03:37.244
- [Cooing continues]
- <i>Then it occurred to me.</i>

03:38.495 --> 03:40.406
<i>A family of wolves I knew</i>

03:40.495 --> 03:43.089
<i>had been blessed</i>
<i>with a litter of cubs.</i>

03:50.295 --> 03:52.286
[Whining, whimpering]

03:55.055 --> 03:56.329
[Barking]

04:23.855 --> 04:26.895
[Loud crying]

04:31.055 --> 04:33.649
[Cooing, laughing]

04:42.575 --> 04:44.850
<i>I knew there'd be no problem</i>
<i>with the mother,</i>

04:44.935 --> 04:46.653
<i>thanks to the maternal instinct,</i>

04:46.735 --> 04:50.774
<i>but I wasn't so sure</i>
<i>about Rama, the father.</i>

04:51.855 --> 04:53.607
[Sniffs]

04:53.695 --> 04:55.447
[Crying]

04:56.415 --> 04:59.805
[Cooing, laughing]

05:02.735 --> 05:05.249
[Laughing continues]

05:21.375 --> 05:24.287
<i>Ten times, the rains</i>
<i>had come and gone,</i>

05:24.375 --> 05:28.129
<i>and I often stopped by to see how</i>
<i>Mowgli, the man cub, was getting along.</i>

05:28.215 --> 05:31.127
<i>He was a favourite with all</i>
<i>the young wolf cubs of the pack.</i>

05:31.215 --> 05:35.208
[Imitates howling]

05:35.295 --> 05:38.492
[Howling]

05:39.215 --> 05:40.933
- [Grunts]
- [Panting]

05:41.015 --> 05:43.449
[Laughing]

05:43.535 --> 05:46.686
[Whimpering]

05:46.775 --> 05:49.050
<i>No man cub was ever happier.</i>

05:49.135 --> 05:52.764
<i>And yet, I knew that someday</i>

05:52.855 --> 05:55.847
<i>he would have to go back</i>
<i>to his own kind.</i>

05:56.895 --> 05:58.214
[Wolf howling]

05:59.175 --> 06:04.124
<i>Then one night, the wolf pack</i>
<i>elders met at Council Rock</i>

06:04.215 --> 06:06.854
<i>because Shere Khan, the tiger,</i>

06:06.935 --> 06:09.972
<i>had returned</i>
<i>to their part of the jungle.</i>

06:10.055 --> 06:14.207
<i>This meeting was to change</i>
<i>the man cub's entire future.</i>

06:14.295 --> 06:18.732
Shere Khan will surely kill the boy
and all who try to protect him.

06:18.815 --> 06:23.491
Now, are we all in agreement
as to what must be done?

06:24.735 --> 06:28.364
Now it is my unpleasant duty
to tell the boy's father.

06:28.455 --> 06:31.253
Rama.
Uh, come over here, please.

06:31.335 --> 06:33.405
Yes, Akela?

06:33.495 --> 06:35.531
The council
has reached its decision.

06:35.615 --> 06:38.846
The man cub can no longer
stay with the pack.

06:38.935 --> 06:40.368
He must leave at once.

06:40.455 --> 06:42.047
"Leave"?

06:42.135 --> 06:45.571
I'm sorry, Rama.
There is no other way.

06:45.655 --> 06:48.374
But... But the man cub is...

06:48.455 --> 06:50.207
Well, he's like my own son.

06:50.295 --> 06:53.128
Surely he's entitled
to the protection of the pack.

06:53.215 --> 06:55.524
But, Rama, even the strength
of the pack

06:55.615 --> 06:57.606
is no match for the tiger.

06:57.695 --> 07:01.051
[Rama] But the boy cannot
survive alone in the jungle.

07:01.135 --> 07:03.808
Akela, perhaps
I can be of help.

07:04.455 --> 07:07.288
You, Bagheera? How?

07:07.375 --> 07:10.492
I know of a man-village
where he'll be safe.

07:10.575 --> 07:14.090
Mowgli and I have taken many walks
into the jungle together.

07:14.175 --> 07:16.086
I'm sure he'll go with me.

07:16.175 --> 07:19.053
So be it. Now there's no time to lose.

07:19.735 --> 07:21.407
Good luck.

07:33.775 --> 07:37.609
Bagheera, I'm getting a little sleepy.

07:37.695 --> 07:39.287
Shouldn't we start back home?

07:39.375 --> 07:43.084
Mowgli, this time
we're not going back.

07:44.455 --> 07:47.891
- I'm taking you to a man-village.
- But why?

07:47.975 --> 07:52.253
Because Shere Khan has returned
to this part of the jungle...

07:52.895 --> 07:54.567
...and he has sworn to kill you.

07:54.655 --> 07:57.123
Kill me?
But why would he want to do that?

07:57.695 --> 07:59.811
He hates man.

07:59.895 --> 08:03.649
Shere Khan is not going to allow you
to grow up to become a man,

08:03.735 --> 08:05.532
just another hunter with a gun.

08:05.615 --> 08:09.494
Aw, we'll just explain to him
that I'd never do a thing like that.

08:09.575 --> 08:13.170
Nonsense. No one explains
anything to Shere Khan.

08:13.255 --> 08:16.372
Well, maybe so,
but I'm not afraid.

08:16.455 --> 08:19.367
- And besides, I...
- Now, that's enough.

08:19.455 --> 08:20.888
We'll spend the night here.

08:20.975 --> 08:23.045
Things will look better
in the morning.

08:24.295 --> 08:25.410
Man Cub?

08:26.375 --> 08:27.967
Man Cub!

08:28.895 --> 08:32.171
Now, come on. Up this tree.
It's safer up there.

08:32.255 --> 08:36.168
Uh... I don't wanna go back
to the man-village.

08:36.255 --> 08:37.927
Go on. Up you go.

08:39.095 --> 08:41.655
- That limb way up there?
- That's right.

08:45.015 --> 08:47.768
[Laughing] Is that all the better
you can climb?

08:48.535 --> 08:50.810
[Grunting] It's too big around.

08:50.895 --> 08:53.967
And besides, I don't have any claws.

08:55.135 --> 08:57.285
[Grunting]

08:57.375 --> 08:59.286
- Yeow-ohhh!
- [Snarling]

09:01.935 --> 09:03.334
[Groaning]

09:10.215 --> 09:12.934
Now get some sleep.

09:13.015 --> 09:15.927
We've got a long journey
ahead of us tomorrow.

09:16.015 --> 09:18.165
I wanna stay in the jungle.

09:18.255 --> 09:21.486
Huh? [chuckles]
You wouldn't last one day.

09:21.575 --> 09:24.248
[Yawns]

09:24.295 --> 09:25.967
I'm not afraid.

09:26.095 --> 09:28.051
I... I can look out for myself.

09:30.335 --> 09:32.132
[Smacking lips]

09:36.575 --> 09:39.169
S-S-S-Say, now.

09:39.255 --> 09:41.689
What have we here?

09:41.775 --> 09:44.926
[Giggles] It's a man cub.

09:45.735 --> 09:49.284
A delic-i-ous man cub.

09:49.375 --> 09:51.411
Oh, go away and leave me alone.

09:51.495 --> 09:55.204
[Yawns] Oh, that's just what
I should do, but I'm not.

09:56.175 --> 09:59.770
Oh, now, please
go to sleep, Man Cub.

10:01.415 --> 10:03.804
Yes-s-s-s, Man Cub.

10:03.895 --> 10:07.092
<i># Pleas-s-se go to sleep</i>

10:07.175 --> 10:10.053
<i># Please go to sleep</i>

10:10.135 --> 10:13.252
<i># S-S-Sleep, little man cub</i>

10:13.335 --> 10:15.974
<i># Rest in peace #</i>

10:20.375 --> 10:22.491
Sleep.

10:22.575 --> 10:25.487
- S-S-S-Sleep.
- [Moaning]

Ba-Ba-Bagheera...

10:27.815 --> 10:29.248
[gulps]

10:29.335 --> 10:33.851
Oh, now... now, look,
there's no use arguing anymore.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.453
Now, no more talk till morning.

10:36.535 --> 10:39.652
[Chuckles] He won't be here
in the morning.

10:39.735 --> 10:42.886
Huh? Oh, yes, he will. I...

10:42.975 --> 10:45.091
Kaa! Hold it, Kaa!

Ohhh!

10:48.935 --> 10:50.846
My sinus-s-s-s-s.

10:51.575 --> 10:56.410
You have just made
a s-s-s-serious mistake, my friend,

10:56.495 --> 10:59.532
a very s-s-s-stupid...

10:59.615 --> 11:01.173
[stammers] Now, Kaa, I was...

11:01.255 --> 11:03.325
[Kaa]... mistake.

11:03.415 --> 11:05.804
Look me in the eye
when I'm speaking to you.

11:05.895 --> 11:07.453
No, please, Kaa...

11:07.535 --> 11:10.003
Both eyes, if you please.

11:11.535 --> 11:14.049
You have just

11:14.135 --> 11:17.571
s-s-s-sealed your doom.

11:17.655 --> 11:19.008
Ohhh... Aaah!

11:21.815 --> 11:23.487
Aaah! Ooh.

11:23.575 --> 11:25.247
Look, Bagheera.

11:25.335 --> 11:28.213
Look. Bagheera.
Wake up, Bagheera.

11:29.335 --> 11:31.212
[Groaning] Wha...?

11:32.255 --> 11:36.567
Just you wait
till I get you in my coils.

11:36.655 --> 11:37.929
Uhhh!

11:38.015 --> 11:41.291
[Mowgli laughing] Bagheera,
he's got a knot in his tail!

11:43.095 --> 11:44.448
[Grunting]

11:48.695 --> 11:52.051
[Moaning] This is going
to slow down

11:58.455 --> 12:02.164
So, you can look out
for yourself, can you?

12:02.255 --> 12:04.325
So, you want to stay
in the jungle, do you?

12:04.415 --> 12:07.327
Yes, I wanna stay in the jungle.

12:07.415 --> 12:11.203
Ohhh! Now, now,

- Can I do it too?
- Sure. Just do what I do.

Wipe off that silly grin, soldier.
This is the army.

16:14.295 --> 16:16.684
[Clears throat] Eyes front.

16:17.975 --> 16:21.206
[Clicks tongue] Lieutenant,
that haircut is not regulation.

16:21.295 --> 16:23.570
Rather on the gaudy side,
don't you think?

16:23.655 --> 16:25.407
There. That's better.

16:27.295 --> 16:29.206
And as for you...

16:29.295 --> 16:31.331
Oh, there you are.

16:31.415 --> 16:33.565
[Chuckles]

16:33.655 --> 16:36.567
Let's keep those heels
together, shall we, son?

16:36.655 --> 16:38.452
OK, Pop.

16:38.535 --> 16:41.049
- Sir.
- Yes, now that's better.

16:41.135 --> 16:43.854
Well, a new recruit, eh?

16:43.935 --> 16:45.607
[Laughs]

16:45.695 --> 16:48.289
- I say, what happened to your trunk?
- Hey!

16:48.375 --> 16:50.366
- Stop that!
- [Gasps, sputtering]

16:50.455 --> 16:54.573
A man cub! Ohh, this is treason!
Sabotage!

16:54.655 --> 16:56.805
I'll have no man cub
in my jungle!

16:56.895 --> 17:00.205
- It's not your jungle!
- Hold it! Hold it!

17:00.295 --> 17:02.206
I can explain, Hathi.

17:02.295 --> 17:05.093
Colonel Hathi, if you please, sir.

17:05.175 --> 17:07.734
Oh, yes, yes. Colonel Hathi.

17:07.815 --> 17:12.366
The man cub is with me.
I'm taking him back to the man-village.

17:12.454 --> 17:15.685
- To stay?
- You have the word of Bagheera.

17:15.775 --> 17:17.527
Good.

17:17.615 --> 17:21.290
And remember,
an elephant never forgets.

17:23.135 --> 17:26.411
[Muttering] I don't know
what the army's coming to these days.

17:26.494 --> 17:29.771
These young whippersnappers.
Who do they think they are?

17:29.855 --> 17:32.289
[Clears throat] Let's get on with it!

17:32.375 --> 17:34.172
Right face!

17:34.255 --> 17:36.371
Forward... march!

17:43.695 --> 17:47.244
Dear, haven't you
forgotten something?

17:47.335 --> 17:49.291
Nonsense, Winifred, old girl.

17:49.375 --> 17:51.525
An elephant never forgets.

17:51.615 --> 17:55.369
Well, you just forgot our son.

17:55.455 --> 17:58.094
Uh, our s... Son? Son!

17:58.175 --> 18:00.370
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Quite right.

18:00.455 --> 18:02.605
To the rear... march!

18:06.775 --> 18:10.484

I'm gonna be a colonel just like my...

I've told you a thousand times...

He said an elephant never forgets.

18:38.575 --> 18:41.851

- It's not funny.

18:41.935 --> 18:45.564

You're going, if I have to
drag you every step of the way.

19:05.935 --> 19:09.371
[Grunting] Let go, you...

Get real loose, then start to weave.
Weave a little. Now, move.

Well, I... I, uh...

22:53.495 --> 22:57.090
Well, I didn't mean

Oh, boy. That's all he needs,
more confidence.

23:39.135 --> 23:41.774

23:50.895 --> 23:54.331
Mowgli, and he's going back
to the man-village right now.

23:54.415 --> 23:58.693
Man-village? They'll ruin 'im!
They'll make a man out of him.

Oh? And just how do you think
he will survive?

24:07.495 --> 24:11.886
"How do you think..."
What do you mean, how do you think he...

24:11.975 --> 24:15.331
He's with me, ain't he?
And I'll learn him all I know.

40:30.375 --> 40:32.093
And another thing,

40:32.175 --> 40:36.054
sooner or later
Mowgli will meet Shere Khan.

40:37.175 --> 40:40.167
The tiger? What's he got
against the kid?

40:40.255 --> 40:43.691
He hates man with a vengeance.
You know that.

40:43.775 --> 40:46.608
Because he fears man's gun
and man's fire.

40:46.695 --> 40:49.414
But little Mowgli
don't have those things.

40:49.495 --> 40:52.328
Shere Khan won't wait until he does.

40:52.415 --> 40:56.010
He'll get Mowgli while
he's young and helpless.

40:56.095 --> 40:57.767
Just one swipe and...

40:57.855 --> 40:59.049
Ohh!

40:59.135 --> 41:01.933
Well... Well, what are we gonna do?

41:02.015 --> 41:03.892
We'll do what's best for the boy.

41:03.975 --> 41:06.489
You better believe it.
You name it, and I'll do it.

41:06.575 --> 41:10.090
Good. Then make Mowgli
go to the man-village.

41:10.175 --> 41:11.403
Are you out of your mind?

41:11.495 --> 41:14.248
I promised him he could stay here
in the jungle with me.

41:14.335 --> 41:16.053
That's just the point.

41:16.135 --> 41:19.047
As long as he remains with you,
he's in danger.

41:19.135 --> 41:21.603
- So it's up to you.
- Why me?

41:21.695 --> 41:24.334
[Stammers] Because
he won't listen to me.

41:25.215 --> 41:27.809
I love that kid. [sniffles]

41:27.895 --> 41:29.726
I love him like he was my own cub.

41:29.815 --> 41:33.091
Then think of what's best
for Mowgli and not yourself.

41:33.175 --> 41:35.291
Uh, well, can't...

41:35.375 --> 41:37.093
Can't I wait until morning?

41:37.175 --> 41:38.813
It's morning now.

41:41.575 --> 41:42.849
Go on, Baloo.

41:44.255 --> 41:45.404
[Sighs]

41:48.775 --> 41:49.969
Uh...

41:59.615 --> 42:01.412
[sighs]

42:01.495 --> 42:02.644
[Gasps]

42:03.775 --> 42:05.128
Oh, boy.

42:07.615 --> 42:10.049
Mowgli. Mowgli.

42:10.615 --> 42:12.924
Uh, it's time to get up.

42:13.015 --> 42:16.371
[Yawns] Oh. Hi, Baloo.

42:16.455 --> 42:17.968
Hi.

42:18.055 --> 42:21.889
Hey, rub that ol' sleep
outta your eyes.

42:21.975 --> 42:25.092
You and me, we got
a long walk ahead of us.

42:25.175 --> 42:28.372
Swell. Gee, we'll have
lots of fun together.

42:29.535 --> 42:32.254
Sure. Yeah. Yeah.

42:32.335 --> 42:35.645
Uh, all right,
let's hit the trail, kid.

42:36.975 --> 42:39.694
See ya around, uh, Bagheera.

42:39.775 --> 42:41.845
Well, goodbye, Bagheera.

42:41.935 --> 42:44.495
Me and Baloo,
we've got things to do.

42:44.575 --> 42:46.372
Goodbye, Man Cub...

42:47.255 --> 42:48.608
...and good luck.

42:48.695 --> 42:50.253
Come on, Baloo.

42:50.335 --> 42:52.132
All we gotta do is...

42:52.215 --> 42:55.491
<i># Look for the bare necessities</i>

42:55.575 --> 42:57.770
<i># Some good ol' bare necessities</i>

<i># Forget about your worries</i>
<i>and your strife</i>

43:06.495 --> 43:09.407

43:10.655 --> 43:13.931
<i># I'll live here in the jungle</i>
<i>all my life #</i>

43:14.015 --> 43:17.132
Yeah, man! I like being a bear.

43:19.415 --> 43:20.768
Where we goin', Baloo?

43:20.855 --> 43:23.972
Well, uh, it's, uh... Um...

43:24.055 --> 43:26.171
Well, it's sorta new and, uh...

43:26.255 --> 43:29.088
Oh, I don't care,
as long as I'm with you.

43:30.335 --> 43:35.045
Mowgli, uh, look, buddy, uh,
there's somethin' I gotta tell ya.

43:35.135 --> 43:36.409
Tell me what, Baloo?

43:36.495 --> 43:38.645
Oh, gee whiz.

43:40.455 --> 43:43.606
Now, how did ol' Baggy put it?
It's, uh...

43:43.695 --> 43:47.244
Uh, uh, Mowgli... [chuckles]

43:47.335 --> 43:49.690
You wouldn't marry
a panther, would ya?

43:49.775 --> 43:53.051
[Laughing] Gee, I don't even know
what you're talking about.

43:53.135 --> 43:54.204
[Growls]

43:54.295 --> 43:57.526
Mowgli, don't you realize
that you're a human?

43:57.615 --> 44:00.573
I'm not anymore, Baloo.
I'm a bear like you.

44:00.655 --> 44:03.772
- Little buddy, look, listen to me.
- Come on, Baloo!

44:03.855 --> 44:06.688
- Mowgli, stop it now. Hold still.
- [Growling]

44:06.775 --> 44:09.084
I wanna tell you something.
Now listen to me.

44:09.175 --> 44:11.735
What's the matter, ol' Papa Bear?

44:11.815 --> 44:15.285
Look, Mowgli, I've been tryin'
all morning to tell ya,

44:15.375 --> 44:18.606
I've got to take you back
to the man-village.

44:18.695 --> 44:21.732
- The man-village?
- Now, look, kid, I can explain.

44:21.815 --> 44:25.251
- But you said we were partners.
- Now, believe me, kid, I...

44:25.335 --> 44:28.566
- You're just like old Bagheera.
- Now just a minute!

44:28.655 --> 44:30.407
That's goin' too far!

44:32.615 --> 44:34.333
Hey, Mowgli! Where you goin'?

44:35.935 --> 44:37.971
Wait a minute! Stop!

44:38.975 --> 44:40.454
Wait!

44:41.215 --> 44:43.854
Wait! Listen to ol' Baloo!

44:43.935 --> 44:45.209
Mowgli!

44:46.015 --> 44:47.130
Mowgli!

44:47.695 --> 44:49.014
Mowgli!

44:52.295 --> 44:54.411
Mowgli. Mowgli!

44:55.575 --> 44:56.849
Now what's happened?

44:56.935 --> 44:59.529
Well, y-you're not
gonna believe me, Bagheera,

44:59.615 --> 45:03.733
but look, now, I used the same words
you did, and he ran out on me!

45:03.815 --> 45:05.726
Well, don't just stand there.

45:05.815 --> 45:09.091
Let's separate. We've got to find him!

45:09.175 --> 45:13.851
Oh, if anything happens to that
little guy, I'll never forgive myself.

45:13.935 --> 45:15.334
I gotta find him.

45:15.415 --> 45:16.848
Mowgli!

45:18.535 --> 45:19.684
Mowgli!

46:11.855 --> 46:13.686
What beastly luck.

46:14.495 --> 46:16.884
Confound that ridiculous Colonel Hathi.

- Ohh! Ohh!
- [Thudding]

47:00.655 --> 47:04.250
Who said "halt"?
I give the commands around here.

47:04.335 --> 47:06.565
Well, speak up. Who was it?

47:06.655 --> 47:08.407
Oh, it was me, Colonel.

47:08.495 --> 47:12.807
What do you mean, sir, taking over
my command? Highly irregular, you know.

47:12.895 --> 47:15.853
Oh, Colonel, I'm sorry,
but I need your help.

47:15.935 --> 47:18.051
[Hathi] Oh, absolutely impossible.

47:18.135 --> 47:19.807
We're on a cross-country march.

47:19.895 --> 47:22.204
[Bagheera] But it's an emergency,
Colonel.

47:22.295 --> 47:25.412
- The man cub must be found.
- [Hathi] Man cub? What man cub?

47:25.495 --> 47:27.167
How interesting.

47:27.255 --> 47:30.247
The one I was taking
to the man-village.

47:30.335 --> 47:32.769
Good. That's where he belongs.

47:32.855 --> 47:36.450
Now, sir, if you don't mind,
we'd like to get on with the march.

47:36.535 --> 47:39.891
[Bagheera] No, no,
you don't understand, Hathi.

47:39.975 --> 47:43.570
He is lost. He ran away.

47:43.655 --> 47:45.566
How delightful.

47:45.655 --> 47:48.886
Well, it serves
the young whippersnapper right.

47:48.975 --> 47:51.773
But... But Shere Khan, the tiger,

47:51.855 --> 47:54.528

47:54.615 --> 47:56.207
[Chuckles]

47:56.295 --> 47:58.809
Shere Khan. Nonsense, old boy.

Shere Khan isn't
within miles of here.

48:01.655 --> 48:04.488
[Chuckling]

48:04.575 --> 48:08.727
Oh, sorry, Bagheera. Fortunes of war
and all that sort of thing, you know.

48:08.815 --> 48:11.648
This has gone far enough.

48:11.735 --> 48:13.726
Far enough!

48:13.815 --> 48:17.444
Now, just a minute,
you pompous old windbag!

48:17.535 --> 48:20.572
Winifred! What are you doing
out of ranks?

48:20.655 --> 48:22.213
Never mind.

48:23.095 --> 48:27.247
How would you like to have our boy
lost and alone in the jungle?

48:27.335 --> 48:29.769
[Hathi] Our son... alone?

48:29.855 --> 48:33.848
But, Winifred, old girl,
that's an entirely different matter.

48:33.935 --> 48:36.608
- [Scoffs]
- Different, entirely.

48:36.695 --> 48:39.812
That little boy is
no different than our own son.

48:39.895 --> 48:43.808
Now you help find him
or I'm taking over command.

48:43.895 --> 48:46.455
What? A female leading my herd?

48:46.535 --> 48:48.287
Utterly preposterous.

48:48.375 --> 48:51.333
Pop, the man cub and I are friends.

48:51.415 --> 48:54.009
He'll get hurt if we don't find him.

48:54.095 --> 48:56.689
Please, Pop, sir? Please?

48:56.775 --> 48:59.494
Now, don't you worry, son.

49:00.695 --> 49:04.210
Your father had a plan
in mind all the time.

49:05.255 --> 49:08.008
[Scoffs] Sure you did.

Oh, thank you, Colonel.
There's no time to lose.

49:44.775 --> 49:46.527
Yes. Yes.

49:46.615 --> 49:49.846
Uh, Bugler, when the man cub is sighted,

49:49.935 --> 49:53.166

Oh, I say.

50:40.135 --> 50:42.774

Kaa! It's you!

52:11.255 --> 52:13.530
Yes-s-s, Man Cub.

52:18.615 --> 52:21.413
Oh, go away. Leave me alone.

52:26.375 --> 52:29.367
You don't want me to look at you?

52:29.975 --> 52:32.170
Then you look at me.

52:33.015 --> 52:35.973
No, sir. I know
what you're trying to do, Kaa.

52:36.055 --> 52:37.090
You do?

52:37.175 --> 52:40.611
Uh, I mean, you don't trust me.

52:40.695 --> 52:44.973
- No.
- Then there's nothing I can do to help.

52:45.055 --> 52:47.046
You want to help me?

52:47.135 --> 52:49.603
[Hisses] Certainly.

52:49.695 --> 52:51.128
I can see to it...

52:51.215 --> 52:54.571
...that you never have
to leave this jungle.

52:55.535 --> 52:56.809
How could you do that?

52:56.895 --> 52:58.567
Hmm?

52:58.655 --> 53:01.123
Oh, I have my own...

53:01.215 --> 53:05.527
...s- s-subtle little ways. [chuckles]

53:06.015 --> 53:09.974
But first, you must trust me.

I don't trust anyone anymore.

54:28.615 --> 54:31.607
<i># Trust in me</i>

54:31.695 --> 54:35.734
<i># And just in me</i>

54:37.175 --> 54:40.292
<i># Shut your eyes</i>

54:41.335 --> 54:44.725
<i># And trust in me #</i>

54:49.295 --> 54:51.525
- [doorbell rings]
- Huh?

54:51.615 --> 54:53.651
Oh, now what?

54:54.375 --> 54:56.093
I'll be right down.

54:57.895 --> 55:01.331
Yes? Yes? Who is it?

55:01.415 --> 55:03.724
It's me, Shere Khan.

55:03.815 --> 55:06.249
Uh, I'd like a word with you,
if you don't mind.

55:06.335 --> 55:11.170
Shere Khan.
What a s-s-surprise.

55:11.255 --> 55:15.487
Yes, isn't it? I just dropped by.

55:15.575 --> 55:17.725
Forgive me if I've interrupted anything.

55:17.815 --> 55:19.771
Oh, no, no. Nothing at all.

55:19.855 --> 55:23.768
I thought perhaps you were entertaining
someone up there in your coils.

55:23.855 --> 55:26.164
Coils? Someone? Oh, no.

55:26.255 --> 55:29.884
I was just curling up for my siesta.

55:29.975 --> 55:31.806
But you were singing to someone.

55:31.895 --> 55:35.683
- Who is it, Kaa?
- [Gulps] Uh, who?

55:35.775 --> 55:37.572
[Coughs] Oh, no.

55:37.655 --> 55:42.775
- I was just singing to myself.
- Indeed.

55:42.855 --> 55:47.804
Yes. Yes, you see,
I have trouble with my s-s-sinuses.

55:47.895 --> 55:51.649
- What a pity.
- Oh, you have no idea.

55:51.735 --> 55:54.932
It's simply terrible. I can't eat.

55:55.015 --> 56:00.135
I can't s-s-sleep,
so I sing myself to sleep.

56:00.215 --> 56:03.844
You know, self-hypnosis?

56:03.935 --> 56:07.245
Let me show you how it works.

56:08.215 --> 56:11.048
<i># Trust in me</i>

56:11.775 --> 56:14.847
- [muffled coughs]
- I can't be bothered with that.

56:14.935 --> 56:16.926
I have no time
for that sort of nonsense.

56:17.015 --> 56:20.928
- [Hisses] Some other time, perhaps?
- Perhaps.

56:21.015 --> 56:23.734
But at the moment
I am searching for a man cub.

56:23.815 --> 56:25.965
"Man cub"? What man cub?

56:26.055 --> 56:28.489
The one who's lost.

56:28.575 --> 56:30.691
Now, where do you suppose he could be?

56:30.775 --> 56:32.925
Search me.

56:33.015 --> 56:35.449
That's an excellent idea. [chuckling]

56:35.535 --> 56:38.652
I'm sure you wouldn't mind
showing me your coils, would you, Kaa?

56:38.735 --> 56:41.249
Uh, [hisses] certainly not.

56:42.855 --> 56:44.811
Nothing here,

56:44.895 --> 56:47.329
and nothing in here.

56:47.975 --> 56:49.772
[Snoring]

56:50.695 --> 56:52.925
[Snorting]

56:54.815 --> 56:56.612
My sinuses.

56:56.695 --> 56:59.607
Hmm. Indeed.

57:00.535 --> 57:03.003
And now, how about the middle?

57:03.095 --> 57:04.608
The middle?

57:05.735 --> 57:07.805
Oh, the middle.

57:12.495 --> 57:15.328
[Laughing] Absolutely
nothing in the middle.

57:15.415 --> 57:17.087
Hmm.

57:18.055 --> 57:19.454
Really?

57:20.495 --> 57:23.692
Well, if you do just happen
to see the man cub,

57:23.775 --> 57:26.164
you will inform me first.

57:26.735 --> 57:31.092
- Understand?
- [Gulps] I get the point.

57:31.175 --> 57:34.531
- Cross my heart, hope to die.
- Good show.

57:34.615 --> 57:39.245
And I must continue my search
for the helpless little lad.

57:41.255 --> 57:44.133
Ooh, who does he think he's fooling?

57:44.215 --> 57:45.967
"Helpless little lad."

57:46.055 --> 57:49.604
Ooh, he gives me the s-s-shivers.

57:52.015 --> 57:55.530
Picking on that poor little
helpless boy. [sighs]

57:57.575 --> 57:59.452
Oh, yes.

57:59.535 --> 58:02.572
The poor little helpless boy.

58:04.215 --> 58:05.284
Aaah!

58:06.935 --> 58:08.653
[Grunts, groans]

58:11.055 --> 58:14.127
You told me a lie, Kaa.
You said I could trust you.

58:14.215 --> 58:16.809
It's like you said.

58:16.895 --> 58:20.604
You can't trust anyone.

58:25.855 --> 58:29.928
If I never see that
skinny little shrimp again,

58:30.015 --> 58:31.846
it will be too soon.

58:33.775 --> 58:38.132
Ooh, my s-s-sacroiliac.

58:44.095 --> 58:45.494
[Thunder rumbling]

58:52.255 --> 58:54.644
[Yawns]

58:56.095 --> 58:58.529
Hey, Flaps. What we gonna do?

58:59.455 --> 59:01.411
I don't know. What do you wanna do?

59:02.415 --> 59:05.373
I've got it! Let's flap over
to the east side of the jungle.

59:05.455 --> 59:08.572
They've always got a bit of action,
a bit of a swingin' scene.

59:08.655 --> 59:11.294
Aw, come off it!
Things are right dead all over.

59:11.375 --> 59:13.843
You mean you wish they were.
[Laughing]

59:13.935 --> 59:16.165
[All laughing]

59:16.255 --> 59:17.813
Very funny.

59:19.815 --> 59:22.045
OK, so what we gonna do?

59:23.775 --> 59:25.527
I don't know. What do you wanna do?

59:25.615 --> 59:28.448
Look, Flaps, first I say,
"What we gonna do?"

59:28.535 --> 59:30.844
Then you say, "I don't know.
What do you wanna do?"

59:30.935 --> 59:32.812
"What we gonna do?"
"What you wanna do?"

59:32.895 --> 59:34.886
What we gonna do, what you want...
Let's do something!

59:34.975 --> 59:37.443
OK. What do you want to do?

59:37.535 --> 59:39.651
Oh, blimey. There you go again.

59:39.735 --> 59:41.453
The same notes again.

59:41.535 --> 59:45.289
I've got it!
This time, I've really got it.

59:45.375 --> 59:48.094
So you've got it.
So what we gonna do?

59:48.175 --> 59:52.248
Hold it, lads.
Look. Look what's coming our way.

59:52.335 --> 59:54.530
Hey, what in the world is that?

59:56.775 --> 59:58.970
What a crazy looking bunch of bones.

59:59.055 --> 01:00:02.013
Yeah, and they're all
walking about by themselves.

01:00:02.095 --> 01:00:03.733
[All laughing]

01:00:07.895 --> 01:00:09.931
- So what we gonna do?
- I don't know.

01:00:10.015 --> 01:00:12.131
Hey, now, don't start that again.

01:00:12.215 --> 01:00:13.568
Come on, lads. Come on.

01:00:13.655 --> 01:00:17.045
Let's have some fun with this
little fella, this little bloke, eh?

01:00:28.335 --> 01:00:31.611
Blimey! He's got legs
like a stork, he has.

01:00:31.695 --> 01:00:34.732
Like a stork. Ha ha!
But he ain't got no feathers, he ain't.

01:00:34.815 --> 01:00:36.487
[Laughter]

01:00:38.135 --> 01:00:41.969
Go ahead. Laugh. I don't care.

01:00:44.895 --> 01:00:46.453
[Thunder rumbling]

01:00:48.015 --> 01:00:49.687
What's wrong with him?

01:00:49.775 --> 01:00:51.208
I think we overdid it.

01:00:51.295 --> 01:00:53.934
We were just having
a bit of fun, that's all.

01:00:54.015 --> 01:00:57.803
Oh, just look at him.
Why, the poor little fella.

01:00:58.815 --> 01:01:00.965
You know, he must be
down on his luck.

01:01:01.055 --> 01:01:04.206
Yeah, or he wouldn't be
in our neighbourhood.

01:01:05.575 --> 01:01:08.009
Hey, new kid! Wait a minute! Hey!

01:01:08.095 --> 01:01:09.847
Just leave me alone.

01:01:09.935 --> 01:01:12.085
Oh, come on. What's wrong?

01:01:12.175 --> 01:01:15.008
You look like you haven't got
a friend in the world.

01:01:15.095 --> 01:01:18.644
- I haven't.
- Haven't you got a mother or a father?

01:01:18.735 --> 01:01:20.805
No. Nobody wants me around.

01:01:20.895 --> 01:01:23.693
Yeah. We know how you feel.

01:01:23.775 --> 01:01:25.891
Nobody wants us around either.

01:01:25.975 --> 01:01:29.729
Oh, we may look a bit shabby,
but we've got hearts.

01:01:29.815 --> 01:01:31.373
And feelings too.

01:01:31.455 --> 01:01:33.366
And just to prove it to you,

01:01:33.455 --> 01:01:36.174
we're going to let you
join our little group.

01:01:36.255 --> 01:01:39.770
Kid, we'd like to make you
an honorary vulture.

01:01:39.855 --> 01:01:43.291
Thanks, but I...
I'd rather be on my own alone.

01:01:43.375 --> 01:01:44.854
Oh, now, look, kid.

01:01:44.935 --> 01:01:46.971
Everybody's got to have friends.

01:01:48.215 --> 01:01:51.695
Hey, fellas, are we his friends?

01:01:51.695 --> 01:01:53.731

Why should you run?

01:04:16.575 --> 01:04:19.328
Could it be possible
that you don't know who I am?

01:04:19.415 --> 01:04:21.883
I know you, all right.

01:04:21.975 --> 01:04:24.250
- You're Shere Khan.
- Precisely.

01:04:24.335 --> 01:04:29.011
Then you should also know
that everyone runs from Shere Khan.

You don't scare me.
I won't run from anyone.

Ah! You have spirit for one so small,

and such spirit is deserving
of a sporting chance.

01:04:42.255 --> 01:04:45.645
Now, I'm going to close
my eyes and count to ten.

more interesting... for me.

- I'll kill you for this. [growling]
- [Thunder crashing]

01:06:18.655 --> 01:06:20.964
Let go! Baloo needs help!

01:06:25.455 --> 01:06:28.253
Fire! That's the only thing
Old Stripes is afraid of.

01:06:28.335 --> 01:06:30.610
You get the fire. We'll do the rest.

01:06:34.495 --> 01:06:35.723
Oof!

01:06:36.735 --> 01:06:38.373
[All] Charge!

01:06:38.455 --> 01:06:42.494
- Punch and blow!
- Stay out of this, you mangy fools!

01:06:42.575 --> 01:06:45.009
Yeah, yeah. Missed me a mile, he did!

01:06:45.095 --> 01:06:46.289
[Vultures laughing]

01:06:46.375 --> 01:06:49.685
- Yeah, pull his blinkin' whiskers!
- [Laughter]

01:06:49.775 --> 01:06:51.606
He's a bloomin' pussycat, he is!

01:06:51.695 --> 01:06:53.845
Look behind you, chum.

01:06:54.815 --> 01:06:56.328
[Roaring]

01:07:00.295 --> 01:07:02.968
[Snarling, roaring]

01:07:08.775 --> 01:07:10.891
[Thunderclap]

01:07:10.975 --> 01:07:13.569
- Well, that's the last of him.
- [Laughter]

01:07:13.655 --> 01:07:15.293
[Laughter continues]

01:07:15.375 --> 01:07:17.889
Old Stripes took off
like a flaming comet, he did.

01:07:17.975 --> 01:07:20.535
Well, come on. Let's go
congratulate our friend.

01:07:21.535 --> 01:07:23.048
Hold it, fellas.

01:07:23.135 --> 01:07:26.286
Now is not the time for it. Look.

01:07:32.575 --> 01:07:33.928
Baloo?

01:07:42.215 --> 01:07:43.330
Baloo, get up.

01:07:44.135 --> 01:07:46.046
Oh, please, get up.

01:07:50.775 --> 01:07:53.289
[Sniffs] Oh.

01:07:56.855 --> 01:07:59.733
Mowgli, try to understand.

01:08:00.375 --> 01:08:02.843
Bagheera, what's the matter with him?

01:08:02.935 --> 01:08:06.132
You've got to be brave,
like Baloo was.

01:08:06.215 --> 01:08:08.570
You... You don't mean...

01:08:09.415 --> 01:08:12.248
Oh, no. Baloo.

01:08:14.815 --> 01:08:15.964
[Sniffles]

01:08:17.734 --> 01:08:21.410
Now, now. I know how you feel.

01:08:23.694 --> 01:08:25.651
But you must remember, Mowgli,

01:08:26.654 --> 01:08:29.328
"Greater love hath no one

01:08:29.415 --> 01:08:33.010
than he who lays down his life
for his friend."

01:08:34.335 --> 01:08:35.814
When great deeds

01:08:35.895 --> 01:08:37.647
are remembered in this jungle,

01:08:38.215 --> 01:08:41.764
one name will stand above all others:

01:08:42.455 --> 01:08:46.368
Our friend, Baloo the bear.

01:08:46.455 --> 01:08:49.527
[Sniffling] He's crackin' me up.

01:08:49.615 --> 01:08:52.890
The memory of Baloo's
sacrifice and bravery

01:08:52.975 --> 01:08:57.014
will forever be engraved
on our saddened hearts.

01:08:57.095 --> 01:08:58.971
Beautiful.

01:08:59.055 --> 01:09:02.968
This spot where Baloo fell
will always be

01:09:03.055 --> 01:09:06.091
a hallowed place in the jungle,

01:09:06.175 --> 01:09:10.532
for there lies one of nature's
noblest creatures.

01:09:10.615 --> 01:09:13.527
[Sniffling]

01:09:13.615 --> 01:09:16.287
I wish my mother
could have heard this.

01:09:16.375 --> 01:09:18.649
It's best we leave now.

01:09:19.575 --> 01:09:21.725
Come along, Man Cub.

01:09:21.814 --> 01:09:24.852
Hey, don't stop now, Baggy.
You're doin' great!

01:09:24.935 --> 01:09:27.733
There's more. Lots more!

01:09:27.814 --> 01:09:30.533
Why, you big fraud!

01:09:30.615 --> 01:09:32.571
[Stammers] You four-flusher!

01:09:32.654 --> 01:09:34.770
I'm-I'm fed up! [sputtering]

01:09:34.854 --> 01:09:38.325
- Baloo, you're all right!
- [Chuckles]

01:09:38.415 --> 01:09:41.327
Who, me? Sure I am.

01:09:41.415 --> 01:09:43.689
Never felt... better.

01:09:43.774 --> 01:09:46.050
[Laughter]

01:09:47.575 --> 01:09:52.126
- You sure had us worried.
- Aw, I was just takin' five.

01:09:52.215 --> 01:09:55.013
You know, playin' it cool.

01:09:55.095 --> 01:09:58.531
- [Chuckling] But he was too easy.
- Good old Papa Bear.

01:09:58.615 --> 01:10:02.210
It's going to be a bit dull
without the little bloke, isn't it?

01:10:02.295 --> 01:10:04.763
Yeah. So what we gonna do?

01:10:04.855 --> 01:10:08.052
I don't know...
Now, don't start that again!

01:10:09.415 --> 01:10:11.883
Hey, Baggy.
Too bad you missed the action.

01:10:11.975 --> 01:10:14.250
You should have seen
how I made a sucker

01:10:14.335 --> 01:10:16.895
out of Old Stripes
with that left up in his face.

01:10:16.975 --> 01:10:19.125
"Boom, boom," I was givin' him. "Wham!"

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:21.854
Wanna know somethin'?
We're good sparring partners.

01:10:21.935 --> 01:10:25.325
- [Laughs] You'd better believe it.
- Yes, sir.

01:10:25.415 --> 01:10:29.533
Nothing or nobody is ever
gonna come between us again.

01:10:31.055 --> 01:10:33.933

01:10:48.775 --> 01:10:52.768
- Oh, it's the man-village.
- No, no. I mean that.

01:10:54.415 --> 01:10:58.169
Forget about those.
They ain't nothing but trouble.

01:10:58.255 --> 01:11:01.691
Just a minute.
I've never seen one before.

01:11:01.775 --> 01:11:04.573
So you've seen one. So let's go.

01:11:04.655 --> 01:11:07.931
I'll be right back.
I want a better look.

01:11:08.015 --> 01:11:11.007
- Mowgli, wait a minute!
- Oh, Baloo.

01:11:11.095 --> 01:11:12.767
Let him have a better look.

- Obviously.

Go on. Go on.

01:13:49.535 --> 01:13:52.208
He's hooked.

01:13:52.295 --> 01:13:54.490
Ah, it was inevitable, Baloo.

01:13:54.575 --> 01:13:56.486
The boy couldn't help himself.

01:13:56.575 --> 01:13:58.531
It was bound to happen.

01:13:58.615 --> 01:14:00.845
Mowgli is where he belongs now.

01:14:02.655 --> 01:14:03.690
Yeah.

01:14:04.535 --> 01:14:06.014
I guess you're right.

01:14:07.015 --> 01:14:11.293
But I still think
he'd have made one swell bear.

01:14:12.735 --> 01:14:14.885
Well, come on, Baggy, buddy.

01:14:14.975 --> 01:14:17.091
Let's get back to where we belong.
