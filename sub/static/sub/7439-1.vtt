00:41.860 --> 00:45.057
<i>You've probably heard</i>
<i>many stories that begin:</i>

00:45.220 --> 00:49.736
<i>"A long, long time ago,</i>
<i>in a land far away."</i>

00:51.300 --> 00:53.131
<i>This one does as well.</i>

00:53.300 --> 00:57.418
<i>But I assure you, this is a story</i>
<i>you have never heard before.</i>

00:57.580 --> 00:59.889
<i>It's the story of a boy named Fred.</i>

01:00.900 --> 01:03.050
<i>And it begins right here.</i>

01:03.780 --> 01:05.179
It's time.

01:05.940 --> 01:08.215
You must push, dear.

01:08.380 --> 01:09.574
That's it.

01:09.740 --> 01:12.777
That's it. One more time, come on. Yes.

01:18.380 --> 01:19.608
What's wrong?

01:21.340 --> 01:24.377
It's the fattest baby I've ever seen.

01:30.660 --> 01:32.571
Good Lord.

01:33.100 --> 01:34.772
Why does he not cry?

01:37.100 --> 01:38.419
What did he say?

01:40.060 --> 01:43.416
He's perfect in every way.

01:44.060 --> 01:45.379
What shall we name him?

01:45.540 --> 01:47.496
My father was called Nicholas.

01:48.060 --> 01:49.175
Yes.

01:49.580 --> 01:51.411
Nicholas Claus.

01:52.420 --> 01:54.775
My Saint Nicholas.

01:56.620 --> 01:57.973
Frederick.

01:58.820 --> 02:01.334
Would you like to come
and meet your brother?

02:16.260 --> 02:17.978
Come along now.

02:26.340 --> 02:30.333
<i>Fred loved Nicholas</i>
<i>from the first moment he met him.</i>

02:30.500 --> 02:34.095
<i>In fact, that day, he made him a promise.</i>

02:35.020 --> 02:39.935
I promise to be the best big brother
in the whole world, Nicholas.

02:43.980 --> 02:47.052
<i>But Fred's promise</i>
<i>is just the beginning of his story.</i>

02:47.220 --> 02:50.212
<i>You see, sometimes it's easier</i>
<i>to make a promise...</i>

02:51.660 --> 02:53.412
<i>... than it is to keep one.</i>

02:57.420 --> 02:58.739
Time to cut the cake.

03:01.220 --> 03:03.256
Here you go, Nicholas.
I made this for you.

03:03.420 --> 03:04.773
Happy birthday.

03:04.940 --> 03:07.818
- I thank you, Frederick.
- That was very nice, Frederick.

03:09.900 --> 03:11.731
Nicholas, where are you going?

03:11.900 --> 03:14.778
There's a poor orphan named Henry
who lives down the road.

03:14.940 --> 03:18.137
I'm bringing all my gifts to him.
He needs them more than I.

03:18.300 --> 03:19.574
That's lovely.

03:19.740 --> 03:23.289
Do you really think Henry needs a journal
with the name "Nicholas" on the cover?

03:23.460 --> 03:26.293
Frederick, it's a saintly thing he does.

03:26.620 --> 03:28.770
My little Saint Nicholas.

03:29.340 --> 03:31.729
<i>And so it went for Fred.</i>

03:33.420 --> 03:37.379
<i>Every time he managed</i>
<i>to make his parents proud...</i>

03:37.540 --> 03:39.371
Frederick, don't you look nice.

03:41.420 --> 03:44.492
<i>... Nicholas managed</i>
<i>to make his parents prouder.</i>

03:44.660 --> 03:48.892
The door was locked, so I decided
to drop down the chimney! What fun!

03:49.340 --> 03:50.375
Oh, Nicholas.

03:50.540 --> 03:52.735
If the door was locked,
why didn't you just knock?

03:52.900 --> 03:54.458
Because he's inventive.

03:54.700 --> 03:56.656
I made the outfit myself, Mother.

03:57.020 --> 03:58.738
I wouldn't go telling people that.

03:59.220 --> 04:02.530
Really, Frederick, why can't you
be more like your brother?

04:12.860 --> 04:16.091
I don't wish to hate him. He means well.

04:16.260 --> 04:19.252
And I promised to be the best
big brother in the world.

04:20.140 --> 04:23.098
You're the only one
who understands me, Chirp-Chirp.

04:37.700 --> 04:40.737
Frederick!
I noticed how much you liked the tree...

04:40.980 --> 04:44.529
...so now we're gonna bring it inside
the house and put presents under it!

04:44.700 --> 04:46.053
Isn't that wonderful?

04:53.580 --> 04:56.777
<i>Chirp-Chirp never returned.</i>

05:06.860 --> 05:08.054
Frederick?

05:10.060 --> 05:11.698
<i>Our poor Fred.</i>

05:11.860 --> 05:13.293
Is this for me?

05:13.460 --> 05:15.974
<i>That tree was the last straw.</i>

05:16.300 --> 05:19.337
<i>He began to resent his brother,</i>
<i>his parents...</i>

05:19.780 --> 05:21.099
<i>... and even his life.</i>

05:21.260 --> 05:23.216
Nicholas, why don't you
open yours first?

05:26.540 --> 05:28.292
Spin it. Spin it!

05:28.460 --> 05:30.735
<i>And like many unhappy children...</i>

05:30.900 --> 05:32.618
Why don't you open yours?

05:33.180 --> 05:35.171
<i>... he became angry.</i>

05:37.420 --> 05:39.331
<i>Naughty, even.</i>

05:43.100 --> 05:44.419
I wonder what it is.

05:47.060 --> 05:48.288
What's the matter, Nicholas?

05:49.420 --> 05:50.409
Nothing.

05:51.340 --> 05:53.137
<i>But while Fred grew worse...</i>

05:53.300 --> 05:56.292
<i>... Nicholas grew more generous</i>
<i>and eventually...</i>

05:56.460 --> 05:58.610
<i>... he fulfilled his mother's prophecy.</i>

05:58.780 --> 06:02.489
<i>In manhood, he literally became a saint.</i>

06:03.460 --> 06:06.975
<i>Now, it's a little-known rule of sainthood,</i>
<i>but when you become a saint...</i>

06:07.140 --> 06:10.610
<i>... you freeze in time, eternally ageless.</i>

06:10.780 --> 06:15.376
<i>The rule applies to the family</i>
<i>of the saint and the spouses, as well.</i>

06:15.540 --> 06:19.897
<i>Now, you probably already have your</i>
<i>suspicions of what became of Saint Nick.</i>

06:20.060 --> 06:24.531
<i>The world grew to know</i>
<i>and love him as Santa Claus.</i>

06:25.140 --> 06:29.816
<i>But as I told you before,</i>
<i>this is a story about Fred.</i>

06:30.340 --> 06:33.650
<i>And the next part of Fred's story</i>
<i>occurs in a time and place...</i>

06:33.820 --> 06:36.050
<i>... that might be a little more</i>
<i>familiar to you.</i>

06:40.180 --> 06:43.570
<i>Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!</i>
<i>Everybody loves Christmas!</i>

06:43.980 --> 06:47.859
<i>Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!</i>
<i>Everybody loves Christmas!</i>

06:48.020 --> 06:51.808
<i>Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!</i>
<i>Everybody loves Christmas!</i>

06:51.980 --> 06:56.132
<i>Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!</i>
<i>Everybody loves Christmas!</i>

06:56.340 --> 06:59.013
You can't take my television!
I watch that in bed!

06:59.180 --> 07:00.249
Are you nuts?

07:00.420 --> 07:03.412
You can't just run up and kick
someone like that. How old are you?

07:03.660 --> 07:05.093
- Nine.
- Nine?

07:05.260 --> 07:07.455
And you have a 55-inch Plasma TV
in your room?

07:07.620 --> 07:09.531
Santa got it for me
for Christmas last year.

07:09.700 --> 07:12.294
The guy in the red suit's
not looking out for your future.

07:12.460 --> 07:13.859
You're gonna get hooked on that.

07:14.020 --> 07:16.454
I can see it now.
Sixteen thousand bags of Cheetos later...

07:16.620 --> 07:19.930
...you'll wake up, you're 35, crying
about your life in front of the soaps.

07:20.100 --> 07:23.137
I did you a favor. You get outside,
play around, make some friends.

07:23.300 --> 07:25.177
Play kick the can, do some athletic stuff.

07:25.340 --> 07:27.137
Go to school,
you're comfortable to play sports.

07:27.300 --> 07:30.770
You have any ethnic in your background?
Any ethnicity in your background?

07:30.940 --> 07:33.090
I bet you do, it's America.
You know what I mean?

07:33.260 --> 07:34.978
Put it on the application for college.

07:35.220 --> 07:38.530
All of a sudden, you get a little extra
money. Uncle Sam's none the wiser.

07:38.700 --> 07:40.816
You take that extra money,
you buy a motorcycle.

07:40.980 --> 07:44.336
Maybe you meet a guy at school.
Then you'll get pregnant with child.

07:44.500 --> 07:46.934
It works out with the guy,
doesn't work out, who cares?

07:47.100 --> 07:48.977
You're blessed to have a kid in your life.

07:49.140 --> 07:52.132
You'll be athletic. You're gonna
be a moderate-to-lukewarm student.

07:52.300 --> 07:54.860
And you're gonna have a child
before you graduate college.

07:55.020 --> 07:57.693
Who are you gonna have to thank?
Not the guy in the red suit.

07:57.860 --> 07:58.895
But your pal, Fred.

08:00.100 --> 08:03.490
Sometimes it hurts to grow!
Hey, guy, you got a girl that kicks.

08:03.660 --> 08:06.936
Is that from you or is that because
you use the TV as a babysitter?

08:07.100 --> 08:10.570
Don't pay your bills again! Next time
I'll come and take your wife from you!

08:10.740 --> 08:13.891
Plasma goes to my place. Pack it
separately, make sure it doesn't scratch.

08:14.060 --> 08:18.338
<i>Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!</i>
<i>Everybody loves...</i>

08:43.140 --> 08:45.096
Catch it, catch it, catch it one time.

08:45.580 --> 08:47.810
Come on, come on, come on,
just a little bit.

08:47.980 --> 08:51.575
That's it, just easy, easy. Damn it.

08:56.780 --> 08:59.931
- Mind changing the station for me, pal?
- It's your buck, buddy.

09:01.900 --> 09:03.572
Can you change that again, please?

09:04.220 --> 09:06.256
Come on, I like that one.
That's a good one.

09:07.620 --> 09:08.848
Can you pull over, please?

09:09.020 --> 09:12.729
- Come on, we're still 15 blocks from the...
- Just pull the cab over, please.

09:17.900 --> 09:20.095
Wanda, you have never been
more attractive to me.

09:20.660 --> 09:23.732
Freddie, I'm mad at you.
No, I'm seriously mad at you.

09:24.060 --> 09:26.051
Two whole days, you don't call me.

09:26.220 --> 09:30.213
I try and have a conversation
with you about our moving in together...

09:30.380 --> 09:33.929
...and then you just disappear.
- Sweetheart, I did not just disappear.

09:34.100 --> 09:37.854
I found myself in a business opportunity
with a sheik. From India.

09:38.020 --> 09:39.817
A sh... There aren't any sheiks in India!

09:39.980 --> 09:42.653
Don't tell that to this guy.
I had to go on a yoga retreat.

09:42.860 --> 09:46.614
But to be honest with you,
my chi... really strong right now.

09:46.780 --> 09:48.896
Freddie, do you know what tomorrow is?

09:49.100 --> 09:50.374
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah.

09:50.540 --> 09:52.132
Yeah, I know what tomorrow is.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.177
- What is it?
- Tomorrow is tomorrow.

09:55.500 --> 09:59.049
And today is today, and we shouldn't
be wasting it arguing with each other.

09:59.220 --> 10:03.816
No, Freddie, apart from that, all right.
What is the significance of tomorrow?

10:03.980 --> 10:07.529
What you're referring to in this
conversation is the day after today?

10:07.900 --> 10:09.094
- Yes.
- You're asking me...

10:09.260 --> 10:11.615
What I'm trying to say is that
when it gets to midnight...

10:11.780 --> 10:16.251
...and then it's one minute past midnight,
tomorrow begins, then it is my birthday!

10:16.900 --> 10:18.253
- That?
- Oh, no.

10:18.420 --> 10:22.174
I know that. The birthday thing,
that I know. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:22.340 --> 10:24.649
Don't try and pretend
you knew it was my birthday...

10:24.820 --> 10:26.572
...because I know you. You didn't know.

10:26.740 --> 10:28.617
- I do know it's your birthday.
- You forgot.

10:28.780 --> 10:31.897
I have a surprise planned for you
for your birthday but you ruined it.

10:32.060 --> 10:35.052
That's what I need, surprises.
Remember our three-year anniversary?

10:35.220 --> 10:38.371
You told me to brush up on French,
you drop hints about the Eiffel Tower...

10:38.540 --> 10:41.213
...and then you took me gambling
on a riverboat in Indiana.

10:41.380 --> 10:43.371
The French thing was
to get you off the scent.

10:43.540 --> 10:46.498
The thing about it was that
I bought those French books on tape.

10:46.660 --> 10:47.979
I studied for three weeks.

10:48.140 --> 10:51.337
That French is yours, that's a part
of you, no one can take that away.

10:54.380 --> 10:55.813
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

10:55.980 --> 10:57.936
I just can't stay mad at you.

10:58.100 --> 11:00.853
Freddie, will you tell me
about the surprise?

11:01.020 --> 11:03.215
If I tell you, it would
no longer be a surprise.

11:03.380 --> 11:04.699
I know, I know, but...

11:04.860 --> 11:06.976
Yeah, you're right.
You shouldn't tell me, then.

11:12.460 --> 11:13.495
You know what?

11:13.660 --> 11:16.254
I'm gonna tell you about the surprise.
It's not a surprise.

11:16.420 --> 11:18.888
You already know what it is,
so it's not a surprise.

11:19.060 --> 11:22.177
So this time, on this specific occasion,
I'll let you know what it is.

11:22.540 --> 11:23.655
- It's a dinner.
- Yeah.

11:23.820 --> 11:27.813
At a pretty exciting new hot spot
here in town called...

11:28.300 --> 11:30.291
...Bonsai Palace.

11:30.540 --> 11:33.737
Oh, that sounds familiar, Bonsai Palace.

11:35.420 --> 11:37.217
- Yeah.
- You're not making this up?

11:37.380 --> 11:40.258
If we go to Bonsai Palace,
it's gonna exist? It's gonna be there?

11:40.420 --> 11:44.618
Absolutely, it's a hot spot.
Think romance, and think getting lost.

11:46.100 --> 11:47.089
<i>Charlie Brown...</i>

11:47.260 --> 11:51.253
<i>... you're the only person I know who can</i>
<i>take a wonderful season like Christmas...</i>

11:51.420 --> 11:52.899
<i>... and turn it into a problem.</i>

11:53.060 --> 11:55.415
<i>Maybe Lucy's right.</i>
<i>Of all the Charlie Browns...</i>

11:55.580 --> 11:56.569
My man, Fred.

11:56.740 --> 11:58.412
Don't come in bouncing off the walls.

11:58.580 --> 12:01.890
If you can come in here, relaxed and be
a gentleman, then you can come in.

12:02.060 --> 12:03.971
- Can you do that? You want some milk?
- Yeah.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.256
Okay. Don't be playing
with the channels...

12:06.420 --> 12:08.809
...and putting on videos
and dancing, it's exhausting.

12:08.980 --> 12:10.413
Okay.

12:10.580 --> 12:12.650
Do you gotta go over the couch?
With the feet.

12:12.820 --> 12:14.572
The feet are dirty, the couch is clean.

12:14.740 --> 12:16.537
- You put the feet off the thing.
- My bad.

12:16.700 --> 12:19.089
- Do you want the milk?
- Yeah, go get that milk.

12:19.460 --> 12:23.612
Yo, Fred. I asked Santa for a puppy
this year. I'm gonna name him Macaroni.

12:23.780 --> 12:27.295
I don't know how Santa's gonna know
where to bring me my gifts this year...

12:27.460 --> 12:29.178
...because I don't know where I'll be.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.934
Because you know how sometimes,
if my grandma's sick...

12:32.100 --> 12:34.056
...I end up staying over at my aunt's.

12:34.220 --> 12:37.098
Most of the time, we just end up
staying over at her boyfriend's.

12:37.260 --> 12:39.296
What you think, Fred?
Think Santa'll find me?

12:39.460 --> 12:41.815
- Slam, you ever thought about Santa?
- Not really.

12:41.980 --> 12:45.370
The guy's in a big red suit flying around
because he craves the spotlight.

12:45.540 --> 12:47.610
He's a fame junkie. The guy's a clown.

12:47.780 --> 12:49.816
He's a megalomaniac.
It's all a big shell game.

12:49.980 --> 12:52.289
He presents himself like,
"Look at me, I'm so nice."

12:52.460 --> 12:54.735
He's getting paid.
He's got a whole thing happening.

12:54.900 --> 12:57.460
Know they sell more Santa
statues along with trinkets...

12:57.660 --> 12:58.979
...than they do of Buddha?

12:59.140 --> 13:02.132
Oh, the big fat dude that be
in the nail salon? He be like:

13:02.300 --> 13:05.531
Don't be a cheerleader for Santa Claus.
Think about it, watch the angles.

13:05.700 --> 13:06.849
Don't drink the Kool-Aid.

13:07.020 --> 13:09.090
- I like Kool-Aid.
- Don't drink this Kool-Aid.

13:09.300 --> 13:10.938
You not gonna ask Santa for nothing?

13:11.180 --> 13:15.139
Slam, I get what I want without charity
from Santa. Two hands on the milk.

13:15.300 --> 13:17.416
- Two hands.
- Two hands if you're gonna drink.

13:17.580 --> 13:20.538
I'm about to step into a
lucrative business situation right now.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.213
I'm working. I'm creating assets.

13:22.380 --> 13:24.052
You know? I'm starting a new business.

13:24.220 --> 13:25.858
- A ass what?
- Assets.

13:26.020 --> 13:28.250
- What that mean?
- Get your mind out of the gutter.

13:29.020 --> 13:30.851
Please, Leon, it's gotta be the spot.

13:31.020 --> 13:33.295
You gotta come up
with the full 50,000 by the 20th.

13:33.460 --> 13:36.179
The only way I can hold it.
People are breathing down my neck.

13:36.340 --> 13:39.935
I got the money. Maybe we're
not underst... I got the money.

13:40.100 --> 13:42.694
It's not about the money.
It's liquidating the money.

13:42.860 --> 13:46.899
I have to get the money in a
liquid situation so that I can pour it.

13:47.180 --> 13:49.614
Listen, what's the largest
growth industry in America?

13:49.780 --> 13:51.099
It's gambling, right?

13:51.260 --> 13:54.093
This space we're standing in
right now, in three months' time...

13:54.260 --> 13:56.296
...will be the most-trafficked
OTB in the city.

13:56.460 --> 13:59.179
We're across the street from
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

13:59.420 --> 14:02.856
So every day when the market closes
and the day traders hit the streets...

14:03.020 --> 14:06.979
...this is where they're gonna come,
Leon. It means everything to me. Please.

14:07.140 --> 14:09.449
Listen, I don't wanna hear
no futzing from you, pal.

14:09.620 --> 14:11.451
I need it by the 22nd. The best I can do.

14:11.700 --> 14:14.089
Whatever. It's gonna be fi...
We're gonna work it out.

14:14.260 --> 14:16.774
- I wanna hear you say the 22nd.
- It's gonna be perfect.

14:16.940 --> 14:19.613
- 22nd is perfect.
- Likely the 22nd, or the 23rd, either way.

14:19.780 --> 14:22.613
22nd and that's it. That's the best
I can do. And that's it.

14:22.780 --> 14:25.852
No more. Icky, but done.
But if it's the 23rd...

14:26.020 --> 14:27.169
Done.

14:27.940 --> 14:29.214
- Twenty-second.
- Two-two.

14:35.020 --> 14:36.851
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

14:37.020 --> 14:38.772
Thank you.

14:39.460 --> 14:41.178
Merry Christmas!

14:41.500 --> 14:42.728
All right, ladies and gentlemen!

14:42.900 --> 14:45.892
Step up for everyone's
favorite charity, People Help the People!

14:46.060 --> 14:48.733
Hey there, give me a hug!
You gorgeous leopard.

14:48.900 --> 14:50.652
Who's the queen of the jungle? You are!

14:50.820 --> 14:53.937
Let me see what we got. Oh, I like it.
Come on, I like how you do it!

14:54.100 --> 14:56.250
Rock me with some paper! Dig deeper.

14:56.420 --> 14:58.251
And another 20.
Let me see what you got.

14:58.420 --> 15:01.332
I'll take both of them. Whatever.
Merry Christmas to you.

15:01.500 --> 15:02.489
Hey, lady!

15:02.660 --> 15:05.697
If you want salvation, no army can
give it to you, only people can!

15:05.860 --> 15:08.658
Bring your action down here! That's it.
Give me that action.

15:08.820 --> 15:11.778
- We only help the people out.
- What do you think you're doing?

15:11.940 --> 15:15.376
Just give me a second. I'll deal with you
in a minute. Don't crowd my action.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.531
Then help some of
these people out this year.

15:17.700 --> 15:20.373
Merry Christmas. You're beautiful, great.
Get out of here.

15:20.540 --> 15:23.373
I don't see your permit.
You need a permit to work this street.

15:23.540 --> 15:26.213
Okay. I don't answer to you, buddy.
I answer to the people.

15:26.380 --> 15:29.690
- Mind your own business, please.
- The Salvation Army is my business!

15:29.860 --> 15:32.169
- What's going on?
- This guy's working without papers!

15:32.340 --> 15:35.730
- And he's bashing the Salvation Army!
- I'm not bashing the Salvation Army.

15:35.900 --> 15:39.495
I never bashed anything. That wasn't
bashing anybody. Don't make up lies.

15:39.660 --> 15:40.979
Show me your papers, clown.

15:41.140 --> 15:43.131
Papers? What are you from, the 1950s?

15:43.300 --> 15:46.451
Look up People Help the People
on the Internet, you'll see a picture.

15:46.620 --> 15:48.451
Why don't you step into
the 21 st century?

15:48.620 --> 15:49.735
Right. Call the cops, man.

15:49.900 --> 15:51.618
You got a cop right there!

15:51.780 --> 15:53.293
- Where?
- Right over there.

15:55.580 --> 15:56.774
Stop, thief!

15:57.700 --> 15:59.452
Somebody call the cops!

15:59.980 --> 16:02.050
- Cut him off!
- He's an impostor!

16:03.900 --> 16:05.049
Take his legs out!

16:08.020 --> 16:10.580
- Come on! Help us out! Help us out!
- Get him!

16:23.900 --> 16:24.969
Get out of the way!

16:48.020 --> 16:49.373
We got him!

16:51.460 --> 16:53.451
- You guys got him!
- Come on! Come on!

16:54.140 --> 16:55.368
Let's dance. Let's dance!

16:55.540 --> 16:57.019
Come on, he can't take us all!

16:57.500 --> 17:00.856
Only one man's gonna walk away
from this thing, and I promise you...

17:01.020 --> 17:04.898
...it'll be the lightning quick dude with
the big yellow things in his hands. Dig it?

17:15.660 --> 17:17.252
Nice hat, Santa!

17:17.420 --> 17:18.853
Wanda, are you there?

17:19.020 --> 17:21.011
Can you hear me? It's Fred calling.

17:21.180 --> 17:24.217
Kind of important you pick up right now.
Are you at the restaurant?

17:43.140 --> 17:45.973
Give a call when you get a chance,
as soon as possible. Okay?

17:46.140 --> 17:48.779
Hopefully, I'll talk to you soon. Bye.

17:50.540 --> 17:53.452
Yeah, she's not picking up
the phone, so...

17:54.260 --> 17:57.775
What the hell, it's Christmas.
Go ahead, make another call.

18:02.420 --> 18:03.899
Oh, boy.

18:05.180 --> 18:09.651
No, there's not even a hint of gray left.
It's gone totally white.

18:09.900 --> 18:12.050
Honey, you think I'd look silly
if I dyed it?

18:12.220 --> 18:14.939
You have a nice full head of hair, honey.

18:15.100 --> 18:17.534
It's white, though. Prematurely white.

18:17.700 --> 18:20.817
Oh, Nick. You carry the weight
of the world on your shoulders.

18:20.980 --> 18:22.538
I am not stressed out.

18:22.700 --> 18:25.578
I just got a lot on my mind is all.

18:26.860 --> 18:28.293
You seem upset.

18:28.460 --> 18:31.930
Sweetie, we're 2 percent
behind our delivery quota of last year.

18:32.100 --> 18:34.091
And last year, we barely made it.
Want cookie.

18:34.260 --> 18:36.455
Sweetie, you cannot keep
eating your stress away.

18:36.620 --> 18:39.293
I mean, it's a bit odd that they're
checking up on me now.

18:39.780 --> 18:42.931
I mean, they've never sent an
efficiency expert before. Why now?

18:48.220 --> 18:49.209
<i>- Nick?</i>
- Fred!

18:49.380 --> 18:52.019
- Oh, Nick.
- How's things there, Fred?

18:52.180 --> 18:55.058
God, it's good hearing your voice.
How've things been with you?

18:55.220 --> 18:58.212
Oh, well, fine, fine.
You know, business is crazy...

18:58.380 --> 19:01.053
...but we're swell, we're swell.
How are you, huh?

19:01.220 --> 19:03.415
That's great.
I'm really happy for you, Nick.

19:03.580 --> 19:05.855
The Christmas thing is taking off.
That's awesome.

19:06.020 --> 19:07.339
Yeah, it's catching on. Yeah.

19:07.500 --> 19:10.378
So, what's up, Fred?
Is there anything I can do for you?

19:10.540 --> 19:15.056
If you really wanted to send me a gift,
I guess it would be okay if you sent...

19:15.220 --> 19:18.530
<i>... $5000 to the police station</i>
<i>in Michigan Avenue in my name.</i>

19:18.700 --> 19:20.372
Five thousand dollars?

19:20.540 --> 19:22.815
<i>I'm fine, by the way. I don 't... I'm fine.</i>

19:22.980 --> 19:25.619
- I'm okay, but so you know, l...
<i>- Hold on a second, Fred.</i>

19:25.780 --> 19:27.498
I don't know what this is about...

19:27.660 --> 19:30.970
...but I know it can't be good.
- It sounds like he's in a tough spot.

19:31.140 --> 19:32.892
<i>If you wanna do something for him...</i>

19:33.060 --> 19:37.178
...I know it's hard, but you need
to practice tough love, honey.

19:37.340 --> 19:39.171
- I'm a saint, sweetheart.
- Tough love.

19:39.340 --> 19:41.137
Tough love's a little difficult for me.

19:41.300 --> 19:42.653
Try for me, baby.

19:45.220 --> 19:46.539
<i>- Hey, Fred?</i>
- Hey.

19:46.700 --> 19:50.249
<i>So, 5 grand,</i>
<i>Michigan Avenue Police Station...</i>

19:50.540 --> 19:51.689
...done.

19:52.060 --> 19:55.336
- Merry Christmas, Fred.
<i>- Nick, that is... I really appreciate it, man.</i>

19:57.740 --> 20:00.652
You know what?
I'm gonna give you a gift this year.

20:00.820 --> 20:03.493
Yeah, I am, Nick. I'm gonna give you
$ 10,000 for Christmas.

20:03.660 --> 20:05.696
Merry Christmas. Okay, how's that feel?

20:07.500 --> 20:11.095
That's... I don't understand, though.
I'm giving you 5, Fred, so...

20:11.260 --> 20:13.251
You gotta be open
to someone trying to give...

20:13.420 --> 20:15.615
...because it feels good
for other people to give.

20:15.780 --> 20:18.294
Go ahead, just send me $50,000
on top of the 5, okay?

20:18.460 --> 20:21.133
<i>Then hold your breath, let me go</i>
<i>and blow that up into 60.</i>

20:21.300 --> 20:25.179
Then I'm gonna give you $ 10,000 off
the top with the original $50,000 back...

20:25.340 --> 20:27.695
...so that way I gave you
$ 10,000, you gave me $5000.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.930
I gave you $5000. Merry Christmas.

20:30.100 --> 20:33.775
Wait, wait, wait a second, Fred.

20:33.940 --> 20:36.818
- Fifty thousand dollars on top of the 5?
- What? What?

20:36.980 --> 20:39.733
<i>That's just icing on the cake.</i>
<i>I have a deal going on.</i>

20:39.900 --> 20:42.255
Nick, do me a favor,
don't make this complicated.

20:42.420 --> 20:45.969
<i>I'm in the spirit. Let one brother give</i>
<i>another brother a gift for Christmas.</i>

20:46.140 --> 20:47.937
I feel great about it. Let me feel good?

20:48.780 --> 20:50.736
<i>- Please.</i>
- All right. All right, all right.

20:50.900 --> 20:53.255
Fred, fine. Look, I'll tell you what...

20:53.420 --> 20:56.651
<i>... I will pay the 5000 for your bail, okay?</i>

20:56.820 --> 21:01.336
But if you want the rest of this, then
you're just gonna have to come up here.

21:01.580 --> 21:04.652
- No!
<i>- Yes! You earn that money!</i>

21:04.820 --> 21:07.812
I don't think that's a good idea,
me and you to be with each other.

21:07.980 --> 21:10.892
You know something?
You've never come up here to visit.

21:11.060 --> 21:12.209
Not even once.

21:19.660 --> 21:22.413
What is it exactly...?
What would I need to be doing up there?

21:23.100 --> 21:25.739
Shave a few reindeer,
sprinkle the doodads on the cookies...

21:25.900 --> 21:29.051
...put the stars up where the little guys
can't reach them. It's easy.

21:29.540 --> 21:32.976
I'd have to have a hard out by the 22nd.
That's when I have my deal happening.

21:33.140 --> 21:35.529
Okay. Twenty-second.

21:35.700 --> 21:38.498
This isn't about me coming up,
then you having Mom ambush me...

21:38.660 --> 21:41.618
Come on. I'm not gonna go
running to Mom.

21:42.420 --> 21:45.890
I have no idea why you won't send 50
so I can blow it into 60 and give you 10.

21:46.060 --> 21:51.339
I'm sorry. I'm gonna practice tough love
on you, buddy. All right?

21:51.500 --> 21:52.899
And I'm telling you right now...

21:53.060 --> 21:57.212
...if you do not agree, then I am sorry,
but I cannot pay your bail.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.934
Wanda, can you buzz me in? It's Fred.

22:03.100 --> 22:04.692
Hey, sweetheart, I know you're home!

22:05.380 --> 22:07.655
Freddie, go home.
I don't wanna talk to you. Go home!

22:07.820 --> 22:11.176
Okay, Wanda, I just wanted to get
a chance to come by and explain.

22:11.340 --> 22:15.174
Oh, explain? You wanna explain to
me my romantic surprise birthday dinner?

22:15.340 --> 22:18.059
I was working for the
People Help People charity organization.

22:18.220 --> 22:20.290
I was chased by 30 Santa Clauses!

22:20.460 --> 22:22.735
Shut up down there!
People are trying to sleep!

22:22.900 --> 22:26.131
- I'm telling you the truth.
- She doesn't believe you, pal! So get lost!

22:26.300 --> 22:30.179
Hey, Jerry Garcia, I'm having a talk
with someone who l... You're the worst.

22:30.340 --> 22:32.934
Fred, will you go home right this minute!

22:33.100 --> 22:36.729
Wanda, there's this unfortunate business
situation I have to leave for tonight.

22:36.900 --> 22:37.969
You what?

22:38.140 --> 22:41.257
Look, this is a business situation
that I'm in with my brother.

22:41.420 --> 22:44.298
When we first met, I said,
"Have you got a brother or a sister?"

22:44.460 --> 22:46.098
And you said, "No, Wanda, I don't!"

22:46.260 --> 22:48.615
I have a bro...
I have the same mother and father...

22:48.780 --> 22:52.136
...but I never felt like I had a brother.
The courts would tell me I would.

22:52.300 --> 22:54.860
- No, listen to me...
- I am through with this relationship!

22:55.020 --> 22:57.375
- I'm not through with this.
- I can't take it anymore.

22:57.540 --> 22:58.973
- I can't take it!
- I can take it.

22:59.140 --> 23:01.335
Freddie, I think I'm gonna
go back to London.

23:01.500 --> 23:03.934
So good luck with your brother,
if he even exists!

23:04.100 --> 23:07.536
- Good luck. I can't take it.
- It'll rain in London, you won't be happy...

23:08.140 --> 23:09.459
Wanda!

23:11.500 --> 23:12.979
Fred, I need you!

23:13.140 --> 23:15.449
- Not now, I'm in a hurry.
- Pretend to be my father.

23:16.020 --> 23:18.215
- What are you talking about?
- He's in here.

23:22.180 --> 23:24.933
- Who are you?
- I'm the boy's father. Who are you?

23:25.260 --> 23:29.094
We're with Child Services, sir. We're here
to remove this minor from an unfit home.

23:29.420 --> 23:32.378
According to our records,
his father passed away a year ago.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.411
I thought you said that your dad was...

23:38.140 --> 23:39.892
All right, come here a second.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.490
You can't count on anyone, Slam.

23:44.060 --> 23:46.494
You gotta always look out for yourself.

23:47.580 --> 23:49.138
And you know how to do that, right?

23:50.540 --> 23:51.689
Yeah.

23:59.340 --> 24:00.614
Let's get something straight.

24:00.780 --> 24:04.170
If you're waiting for me to sing " The Sun
Will Come Out Tomorrow" on the way...

24:04.340 --> 24:06.615
...you're wasting your time. Let's go.

24:36.940 --> 24:38.532
Are you Fred?

24:38.700 --> 24:39.849
Yeah.

24:49.060 --> 24:50.778
Can I see some identification, please?

25:02.900 --> 25:06.017
Well, nice to meet you, Fred. My name
is Willie. I'm Santa's head elf.

25:06.180 --> 25:08.535
I wouldn't have known that.

25:08.700 --> 25:11.260
So just the one bag?
Just the one carry on? I'll get it.

25:11.420 --> 25:13.058
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

25:14.620 --> 25:18.772
- Okay, I'll help you get...
- No, no. I got it. I got it. Okay.

25:21.100 --> 25:24.456
- I'll just grab this here. That's okay.
- I could've gotten it.

25:24.620 --> 25:27.453
If I had one more little shot at it,
I would've been just fine.

25:40.860 --> 25:42.134
Come on.

25:50.860 --> 25:53.090
So listen, I'm not so big
on all this flying...

25:59.260 --> 26:00.534
Whoa, okay.

26:18.980 --> 26:20.936
We'll start our descent to the North Pole.

26:21.100 --> 26:23.898
We know you don't have an option
traveling to the North Pole...

26:24.060 --> 26:27.336
...but we appreciate your business,
and I really enjoyed the conversation.

26:27.500 --> 26:29.013
Okay, is this gonna be a steep...?

26:57.420 --> 26:59.615
Really? The hockey stop?

26:59.780 --> 27:02.658
Yeah, there's a passenger back here,
in case you didn't remember.

27:02.820 --> 27:04.936
Oh, sorry. Least you didn't throw up.

27:27.100 --> 27:30.058
Watch your step there. Well, here it is.

27:30.900 --> 27:32.936
Main Street, North Pole.

27:33.100 --> 27:35.136
Pretty, isn't it?

27:35.300 --> 27:36.449
Workshop's behind you.

27:44.500 --> 27:48.618
Mr. Claus? Hi. Hello. Welcome to the
North Pole. It's so nice to have you here.

27:48.780 --> 27:50.179
I'm Santa's Little Helper.

27:50.340 --> 27:53.218
I am sorry to rush you, but we
have to keep Santa on schedule...

27:53.380 --> 27:57.373
...because we are 439 hours, 22
minutes, and 3 seconds until C-Day.

27:57.660 --> 28:00.128
Charlene's as good with numbers
as she is beautiful.

28:01.260 --> 28:03.694
Oh, thank you. Thank you...

28:04.820 --> 28:06.492
- Willie.
- Willie!

28:07.180 --> 28:08.932
Thank you, Willie.

28:14.380 --> 28:16.132
So I'm expecting Santa in 26 seconds.

28:17.900 --> 28:21.256
Big Red is entering Zone One.
I repeat, Big Red is entering Zone One.

28:23.540 --> 28:25.417
- Allergies.
- He's got a gun!

28:31.380 --> 28:32.813
Oh, no, no.

28:36.540 --> 28:38.576
What's happening? Stop it!

28:38.740 --> 28:43.734
- What's happening? Stop it!
- No, no, no, boys! Boys! Boys, easy!

28:45.340 --> 28:46.978
Oh, Fred.

28:47.660 --> 28:48.649
That was nuts!

28:49.740 --> 28:52.857
What is happening here? You don't have
ninjas jump me when I first...

28:53.020 --> 28:55.454
- What kind of greeting is that?
- Excuse the guys...

28:55.620 --> 28:57.576
...it's the month before Christmas,
a tense time.

28:57.740 --> 29:01.096
They get jumpy. They gotta
make sure nothing happens to me.

29:01.260 --> 29:03.899
Maybe something should happen to them.
Maybe I give them something.

29:04.060 --> 29:06.415
It won't happen again.
They won't do it again.

29:06.580 --> 29:10.175
- You gotta put these guys on a leash.
- I got you. I'm on top of it, ASAP.

29:10.620 --> 29:12.850
You remember Annette.
Say hey to Annette. Annette.

29:13.020 --> 29:16.012
Annette, you didn't have to go get
all gussied up on my account.

29:16.380 --> 29:19.258
That last stint in jail has sharpened
that rapier wit of yours.

29:19.420 --> 29:22.412
That's great. I'm here for you and
I really can't do enough for you.

29:22.580 --> 29:26.289
Really? I thought you were here to take
advantage of your well-meaning brother.

29:26.460 --> 29:28.178
Oh, ho, okay.

29:29.260 --> 29:31.455
Family's together again. Fun, fun, fun.

29:31.620 --> 29:34.578
Hey, Fred, I've already made
your sleeping arrangements for you.

29:34.740 --> 29:37.459
I have put you with Willie.

29:37.620 --> 29:39.053
Well, here we are.

29:39.220 --> 29:41.814
Oh, watch your head there. Come on in.

29:43.020 --> 29:45.580
Here it is. What do you think?

29:46.380 --> 29:48.450
Smurfy. Very Smurfy.

29:50.700 --> 29:53.134
To be honest,
I don't get many house guests.

29:53.340 --> 29:55.331
No one's slept in that bunk
for 100 years.

29:55.660 --> 29:57.696
Good night, Willie.
Thank you for having me.

29:57.860 --> 29:59.134
Good night, Fred.

30:00.100 --> 30:03.137
You sure you wouldn't be more
comfortable down here on the bottom?

30:03.300 --> 30:06.053
I don't think it's gonna make much
of a difference, Willie.

30:06.220 --> 30:08.814
- Okay. Night, Fred.
- Good night.

30:17.540 --> 30:21.419
Willie, just for the record,
I'm not really a morning person.

30:21.940 --> 30:25.933
Well, Santa did ask me to give you a full
orientation of the gift-giving process...

30:26.100 --> 30:28.933
...so we'd better get a move on here.

30:35.820 --> 30:38.698
Here it is, Fred, Santa's Workshop.

30:53.620 --> 30:56.657
It all starts with a kid and a letter.

30:57.180 --> 30:59.648
<i>All over the world,</i>
<i>children are writing to Santa...</i>

30:59.820 --> 31:01.776
<i>... asking for what they want</i>
<i>for Christmas.</i>

31:02.540 --> 31:04.132
<i>Dear Santa...</i>

31:04.300 --> 31:07.258
<i>... all I want for Christmas</i>
<i>is an orange bicycle...</i>

31:07.420 --> 31:09.058
<i>... with banana handlebars.</i>

31:09.220 --> 31:12.178
<i>All the kids ' letters come here</i>
<i>to the North Pole Post Office...</i>

31:12.340 --> 31:14.331
<i>... the busiest in the whole world.</i>

31:17.580 --> 31:20.572
<i>Once they're sorted, the letters</i>
<i>come straight to the Toy Factory.</i>

31:23.500 --> 31:26.060
- Orange bicycle for Molly Gordon.
- Put her through.

31:26.220 --> 31:30.179
<i>Each and every toy that a child</i>
<i>asks for is handmade by the elves.</i>

31:30.340 --> 31:34.015
<i>It's important to Santa that every child</i>
<i>feels taken care of.</i>

31:34.180 --> 31:36.774
<i>Once built, the toys</i>
<i>make their way to Packaging.</i>

31:37.100 --> 31:41.890
And finally, the toys are stored until
Christmas Eve, when Santa delivers them.

31:42.060 --> 31:43.698
It's good to know. Thank you, Willie.

31:43.860 --> 31:47.819
<i>Here comes "Here Comes Santa Claus"</i>
<i>on NP- 100.</i>

31:48.700 --> 31:51.658
Oh, you're gonna love this.
We have our very own DJ.

31:53.420 --> 31:55.012
Hey, Donnie! DJ Donnie.

31:55.260 --> 31:59.538
Well, well, well, it's the saint
who puts the chill in the North Pole.

32:00.380 --> 32:03.850
Hey, hey, DJ Donnie!
Say hey to my big brother, Freddie.

32:04.020 --> 32:06.932
Yo, brother Fred, can I get a "Ho, ho"?

32:07.100 --> 32:08.931
No.

32:09.100 --> 32:10.897
You Scrooge, you lose.

32:12.020 --> 32:14.090
Our Naughty-Nice Department.

32:14.260 --> 32:16.854
This is the key to the whole process...

32:17.020 --> 32:20.092
...the nerve center
of the entire operation, Fred.

32:20.580 --> 32:22.172
You have a Ten Most-Naughty list?

32:22.340 --> 32:23.819
Oh, yeah. Yeah, right now...

32:23.980 --> 32:28.610
...we got Johnny Rollins in Nova Scotia.
He's occupying the number one spot.

32:28.780 --> 32:32.136
Last month he bit his father
and his dentist.

32:32.300 --> 32:33.733
But why did he bite them?

32:33.940 --> 32:37.933
Well, I assume that they got
their hands too close to his mouth.

32:38.100 --> 32:41.410
Of course, sometimes kids
are both naughty and nice.

32:41.580 --> 32:45.368
So in that case, we do an
up-to-date determination, hence...

32:46.100 --> 32:47.328
...the snow globe.

32:47.500 --> 32:49.650
Let me show you how it works, all right?

32:49.820 --> 32:51.412
Timmy Jackson...

32:51.980 --> 32:53.095
...New York City.

32:53.900 --> 32:54.889
Watch this.

32:58.460 --> 33:01.896
What are you doing? Get out of my room!
Get out of my room!

33:05.300 --> 33:08.815
Oh, boy. Okay, that seems
pretty cut and dried.

33:09.180 --> 33:10.977
What, we don't
know what happens, what...?

33:11.140 --> 33:14.212
Good morning, Fred. Honey,
may I have a word with you, please?

33:14.380 --> 33:17.338
You betcha. Fred, you just stay
right there. Don't you move an inch.

33:17.580 --> 33:20.140
I better check up on the all-girls
Swedish swimming team.

33:20.300 --> 33:21.813
I'm hoping they're naughty!

33:22.060 --> 33:23.937
- Fred is really motivated.
- You think?

33:24.100 --> 33:27.297
- He's gonna be a big help here.
- How you doing? Be working with you.

33:27.460 --> 33:29.576
The efficiency expert
arrives in 15 minutes.

33:29.740 --> 33:31.731
- We're gonna be fine.
- I know it, I know it.

33:31.900 --> 33:33.731
- Give me a little something.
- Yes, I will.

33:34.660 --> 33:36.332
There we go. Alrighty.

33:36.620 --> 33:37.939
Let's get you to work.

33:38.580 --> 33:42.129
Now, I'm going to explain this to you
in very simple terms, okay?

33:42.380 --> 33:46.009
Now, see those blue files?
I want you to review those files, okay?

33:46.300 --> 33:49.098
If the kid strikes you as naughty...

33:50.220 --> 33:52.290
...bam! Stamp him "Naughty."

33:52.460 --> 33:55.577
All right? But if the kid
strikes you as nice...

33:56.460 --> 33:58.496
Yep, you stamp them "Nice."

33:58.660 --> 34:00.252
I'm a cog in the wheel. I am.

34:00.420 --> 34:04.015
Good, all right. I gotta hustle, because
I gotta meet somebody right now, okay?

34:04.180 --> 34:05.852
- Aye, aye, captain.
- Captain's on deck.

34:06.020 --> 34:07.897
- Rest assured, my man.
- Mail delivery!

34:08.060 --> 34:11.052
- The ship's getting steered safely!
- All right, buddy.

34:11.219 --> 34:13.097
- Great. So this is it?
- Yeah, right.

34:13.260 --> 34:14.693
That's just Bethesda, Maryland.

34:15.739 --> 34:19.733
<i>All right, everyone. Oh, my goodness,</i>
<i>it's "Here Comes Santa Claus!"</i>

34:30.940 --> 34:33.373
You didn't have to travel
by helicopter, Mr. Northcutt.

34:33.540 --> 34:35.178
I would've happily sent the sleigh.

34:35.340 --> 34:37.058
I despise reindeer.

34:38.860 --> 34:41.976
Would you like to settle in?
We have your room ready.

34:42.219 --> 34:43.972
You could take a little nap.

34:44.139 --> 34:45.891
I don't nap.

34:46.219 --> 34:48.130
Well, that sounds like
it's gonna be dandy.

34:48.300 --> 34:51.690
As you can see from the chart
labeled 116-9C...

34:51.860 --> 34:56.331
...the average size of a child's wish list
has grown a lot in the last 200 years.

34:56.500 --> 34:59.810
In the 1800s, for example, children
rarely asked for more than one item...

34:59.980 --> 35:03.052
...and usually these items
were of a intangible nature.

35:03.220 --> 35:06.735
Something like a family member's health
or the end of war or famine.

35:06.900 --> 35:09.653
I remember that.
Try fitting that down the chimney, huh?

35:11.140 --> 35:13.893
Chart 345-11 B shows that today...

35:14.060 --> 35:17.735
...the average child
asks for 15 gifts per letter.

35:17.900 --> 35:20.733
Growing child demands and increasingly
complicated toy making...

35:20.900 --> 35:24.973
...are putting your operation further
behind each year. It's not good enough.

35:25.140 --> 35:29.372
Well, now, we are not here to give
every child every toy that they want.

35:29.540 --> 35:33.419
Mr. Northcutt, part of Christmas is being
grateful for the things that we can have.

35:33.740 --> 35:36.652
- Yes, well, if it were only that simple.
- It's not?

35:36.820 --> 35:39.539
No. Sadly. You see...

35:39.980 --> 35:43.097
...the board is seriously considering...

35:43.620 --> 35:44.769
...shutting you down.

35:46.100 --> 35:47.135
What?

35:47.300 --> 35:48.972
- That's so unfair.
- Shutting us down?

35:49.140 --> 35:50.619
Streamlining, consolidating...

35:50.780 --> 35:53.578
...outsourcing an entirely new
operation based at...

35:53.740 --> 35:56.208
...and I know this is gonna be
tough for you to hear...

35:56.380 --> 35:58.336
...based at the South Pole.

35:59.940 --> 36:03.853
It's not just you. We're putting the tooth
fairy on a one child, one tooth system.

36:04.020 --> 36:06.978
You lose your first tooth,
get a buck, put it under the pillow.

36:07.140 --> 36:09.495
But then get on with your life.
It's getting a bit...

36:09.660 --> 36:12.174
Don't you think? Also,
we're gonna dump the Easter bunny.

36:12.460 --> 36:14.212
It just doesn't make any sense anymore.

36:14.380 --> 36:16.814
I mean, Easter and bunnies
and eggs and all that.

36:16.980 --> 36:18.732
Where's the synergy? Don't get it.

36:19.540 --> 36:22.100
Now, let's move on to the next item
on the list, shall we?

36:22.420 --> 36:24.934
How much are you actually
feeding those elves?

36:28.780 --> 36:31.931
Wanda Blinkowski, Chicago, Illinois.

36:37.100 --> 36:38.328
Is that someone special?

36:38.500 --> 36:40.775
Yeah. That's my girl, there.

36:41.020 --> 36:44.330
Oh, no. I totally spaced out.
Look, I got a quarter right here.

36:44.540 --> 36:47.259
<i>Well, I'm sorry, darling,</i>
<i>but you're two minutes too late.</i>

36:47.420 --> 36:49.809
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

36:50.020 --> 36:52.580
That must make you feel bad,
having people argue with you.

36:52.740 --> 36:55.698
Yeah, well, it's definitely
not the favorite part of my job.

36:55.860 --> 36:58.533
How about I make it up to you?
Let me take you to dinner.

36:59.180 --> 37:00.169
Go to dinner with you?

37:00.340 --> 37:03.412
Consider it a meal
and sparkling conversation.

37:04.140 --> 37:06.449
No, I can't. Thank you, but I can't.

37:06.620 --> 37:09.817
It's always painful to watch
a guy crash and burn, my man.

37:09.980 --> 37:11.174
You have a boyfriend?

37:15.820 --> 37:17.572
No. No, actually, I don't.

37:17.740 --> 37:19.935
<i>Well, that's a good thing.</i>
<i>What do you say?</i>

37:20.420 --> 37:22.570
Well, I'll give you a ticket.

37:23.060 --> 37:25.096
And I'll give you my card.

37:25.260 --> 37:26.898
Okay. Nice to meet you.

37:27.060 --> 37:29.415
<i>This may be the best ticket I ever got.</i>

37:29.580 --> 37:31.616
<i>You gotta pay it within 30 days,</i>
<i>you know that?</i>

37:31.780 --> 37:33.736
<i>I'll see you before then, right?</i>

37:48.740 --> 37:50.173
El Paso.

37:50.740 --> 37:51.729
Great.

37:51.900 --> 37:56.018
<i>You're not gonna believe this! Another</i>
<i>request for "Here Comes Santa Claus!"</i>

37:56.180 --> 37:58.296
<i>This time from Beth in Accounting.</i>
<i>Here you go!</i>

37:58.700 --> 38:02.136
Are you kidding me? Are you kidding
me with the "Santa Claus" again?

38:02.340 --> 38:03.978
Hey, DJ!

38:04.500 --> 38:07.014
- DJ Donnie!
- What up, Fred!

38:07.180 --> 38:11.014
Stop playing the same song over and over
again. It becomes like mental torture.

38:11.180 --> 38:13.011
But, Fred, it's so catchy!

38:13.900 --> 38:19.179
God. Okay, Donnie. It's one song that's
being played over and over again.

38:19.340 --> 38:22.696
And the only thing that breaks that up
is you announcing it's the same song.

38:22.860 --> 38:25.420
It would be a nice gesture
to play something different.

38:25.580 --> 38:27.411
- I said no!
- Donnie, change the song.

38:27.620 --> 38:29.338
- No! No!
- Change the song!

38:29.500 --> 38:31.968
You know what? I'm gonna change
the song, then, for you.

38:32.140 --> 38:34.529
What are you getting physical for?
Music's about love.

38:34.700 --> 38:37.009
Don't get physical with me.
We're trying to share.

38:37.180 --> 38:40.729
What are you doing? Stop it. Come on,
stop... What, are you gonna do it to me?

38:40.900 --> 38:43.095
Donnie, stop.
You're acting like an untrained dog.

38:43.260 --> 38:46.889
Get ahold of yourself. Take a breath.
Stop swinging at me. Will you calm down?

38:47.060 --> 38:49.290
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna Supernanny you.

38:49.460 --> 38:52.099
Put you in the Naughty cabinet.
You can't handle yourself.

38:52.260 --> 38:54.410
Listen to me, calm it down a little.
Stop it.

38:54.580 --> 38:57.174
Use your words. Use your words.

38:58.060 --> 39:01.291
I'll let you out once you're sorry
and you're ready to turn a corner...

39:01.460 --> 39:05.248
...and be a team player, okay?
- Don't do it! Put my elf foot up your butt!

39:05.420 --> 39:07.980
I'm from the
south side of the North Pole, man.

39:08.300 --> 39:11.212
- I hear you. Let me out!
- Let's heat it up! Let's heat it up!

39:14.220 --> 39:16.256
Come on, let's loosen it up in here!

39:16.420 --> 39:20.129
You got the same thing playing all the
time. Let's liven it up! Let's get dancing.

39:20.300 --> 39:23.656
Let's get our blood pumping. Let's make
some bad decisions with each other.

39:24.260 --> 39:25.329
Come on.

39:25.820 --> 39:27.697
Stop looking shy, baby, light it up.

39:27.860 --> 39:29.293
Oh, my goodness.

39:34.100 --> 39:36.011
It sounds angry!

39:36.180 --> 39:37.295
I know.

39:38.060 --> 39:40.096
I like it.

39:40.260 --> 39:41.579
Bring it in!

39:46.540 --> 39:48.132
You wanna come up here?

40:30.540 --> 40:32.576
Your continued existence
at the North Pole...

40:32.740 --> 40:35.857
...will all be decided on a simple
three-strike policy.

40:36.020 --> 40:39.729
Make it through Christmas without three
strikes, I send back a positive report.

40:39.900 --> 40:42.209
If, however, you do get three strikes...

40:42.460 --> 40:45.418
...this entire operation
will be shut down permanently.

40:45.900 --> 40:50.530
Oh, and one more thing, absolutely
nobody is to know why I'm here.

40:50.700 --> 40:52.452
Especially the elves.

40:53.740 --> 40:58.416
Of course. Mr. Northcutt, the elves are
extremely dedicated and hardworking.

40:58.580 --> 41:00.810
I am confident that they
will impress you, sir.

41:01.100 --> 41:04.536
Ho, ho, holy cow.

41:34.820 --> 41:36.572
Stop it. Stop it. Stop.

41:36.900 --> 41:40.176
Everyone, this is Mr. Northcutt.

41:40.540 --> 41:42.371
He'll be with us through Christmas.

41:42.540 --> 41:44.929
Please make him welcome
and let him observe.

41:45.620 --> 41:46.735
Back to work.

41:47.820 --> 41:51.017
They have never behaved
like that before. I assure you.

41:51.180 --> 41:52.932
No elf discipline.

41:53.100 --> 41:56.297
Showing a complete lack of control
over your entire workforce.

41:56.460 --> 41:59.930
That's a biggie. It's disappointing.
And that would be strike one.

42:01.300 --> 42:05.213
- I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.
- Oh, that's Fred. That's my older brother.

42:05.380 --> 42:08.929
- He's just helping out for the season.
- I didn't know you had a brother.

42:09.100 --> 42:13.332
Mr. Northcutt, I should have someone
show you around. Willie!

42:13.620 --> 42:15.212
Take a tour, there, Mr. Northcutt.

42:18.380 --> 42:21.178
Fred. What in the heck are you doing?

42:21.380 --> 42:25.339
Nick, let me be completely honest
with you here, the DJ is a real problem.

42:25.740 --> 42:27.412
Fred, he's an elf that plays records.

42:27.580 --> 42:32.017
Nick, he continued to play the same
song over and over and over and over...

42:32.220 --> 42:33.414
Got you. Got you.

42:33.580 --> 42:37.289
He then decided to lay his hands on me
and get physical and tried to hurt me.

42:38.300 --> 42:40.939
Okay? Now, I have a decision
to make in that moment.

42:41.100 --> 42:44.137
Do I wanna try to get physical?
Do I wanna pound this elf's head in?

42:44.300 --> 42:48.259
The answer to that is no. I want him to
know how it feels not to be respected...

42:48.420 --> 42:51.856
...when you're trying to do your work.
- Just lower your voice. Keep it down.

42:52.020 --> 42:55.410
And to be honest, if you decide to punish
him, I'm not gonna be mad at you.

42:55.580 --> 42:57.138
I'm not gonna be upset with you.

42:57.300 --> 43:01.134
If you wanna bring the hammer down
upon his little DJ hands, do it, dude.

43:01.300 --> 43:05.418
Okay. All right. That's a thought.
And I'm gonna sit on that and let it boil.

43:05.580 --> 43:09.892
But what I'm trying to tell you is, the
elves have got to stay sharp, right now.

43:10.060 --> 43:12.051
Very important, okay?

43:12.220 --> 43:15.769
We can't have any type of problems,
anymore, okay?

43:15.940 --> 43:19.410
I get it. We're two brothers talking now,
I know where you're coming from.

43:19.580 --> 43:21.491
That's all that counts.
That's what counts.

43:21.780 --> 43:23.896
Now that you said that,
it's not gonna happen...

43:24.060 --> 43:27.496
...I'm gonna kill him with kindness.
- No, no, no, you don't have to.

43:27.700 --> 43:31.613
Love, kindness, it's coming off of you
like radiation or something.

43:31.780 --> 43:34.055
No, no, no.
You're gonna stay at your station.

43:34.300 --> 43:35.289
Right.

43:35.460 --> 43:37.371
- Smooth sailing, right?
- The smoothest sailing.

43:40.820 --> 43:43.459
Freddie, I am so glad you took
my invitation for dinner.

43:43.620 --> 43:46.054
I'm excited we're gonna be able
to hang out as brothers.

43:46.220 --> 43:47.778
- Break bread, right?
- Absolutely.

43:51.180 --> 43:52.169
I want one.

43:54.340 --> 43:56.217
- Nick! Nick!
- Oh, boy. What?

43:56.380 --> 43:57.893
- Nick!
- What?

43:58.060 --> 43:59.334
- Nick, come here.
- Okay, okay.

43:59.500 --> 44:01.411
What the heck is Mom doing
in the house?

44:01.580 --> 44:03.935
I want you to be honest,
does she know I'm here?

44:04.100 --> 44:07.854
Call me crazy, but my mom comes
and visits me for the holidays every year.

44:08.460 --> 44:11.293
I'm not going in there, Nick,
because I don't visit with Mom...

44:11.460 --> 44:14.850
...and I don't for good reason.
- It would be really nice, if, for once...

44:15.020 --> 44:19.536
...things were nice and calm
and you just dropped by for dinner.

44:19.700 --> 44:23.409
- This isn't even debatable. I'm not going.
- Ho, ho, ho, I'm not gonna listen to no.

44:23.580 --> 44:26.777
There's a book, <i>Does Fred Go to Dinner?</i>
Flip through the pages...

44:26.940 --> 44:29.613
...and last page, Fred does not go
to dinner. The End.

44:29.780 --> 44:33.534
The sequel, know what it's called?
<i>Ding-dong, Who 's There? Why, it's Fred.</i>

44:33.700 --> 44:35.338
- I'm not going.
- Pumpkin pie. Come on.

44:35.500 --> 44:39.698
Get it through your head.
I am not going to dinner!

44:45.820 --> 44:47.651
Hello, I hope I'm not intruding...

44:47.820 --> 44:50.778
...but I ran into your parents,
and they invited me to dinner.

44:51.700 --> 44:54.134
Oh, no, no, yeah, welcome, welcome.

44:57.540 --> 45:01.579
- Here we are.
- So, Frederick, how have you been?

45:01.740 --> 45:04.857
- I've been good, Ma. I've been real good.
- That's nice.

45:05.020 --> 45:07.409
I'll tell you, Fred has been doing
a bang-up job...

45:07.580 --> 45:09.935
...down in the Naughty-Nice Department.

45:10.100 --> 45:11.579
I wouldn't say
I've been doing a bang-up job.

45:11.740 --> 45:14.857
I had complications
and hit rough spots...

45:15.020 --> 45:17.978
...but I'm doing the best I can.
- Oh, yeah, no, no, no...

45:18.140 --> 45:22.213
...you are proving to be
one very hard worker.

45:22.380 --> 45:26.339
Well, I would imagine he's probably
a very hard worker, considering.

45:28.100 --> 45:29.419
Considering what?

45:29.580 --> 45:32.936
Considering that you didn't have the
time to come to our anniversary party.

45:33.100 --> 45:36.331
- Your brother gave us quite a shindig.
- Fred sent a lovely gift, though.

45:36.500 --> 45:39.970
Come on, now, that massage chair,
that looked very, very expensive.

45:40.140 --> 45:41.493
Yes, I'm sure it was.

45:43.820 --> 45:45.458
- What's happening?
- What do you mean?

45:45.620 --> 45:48.339
- I don't see... What's happening?
- Nothing's happening.

45:48.500 --> 45:49.853
Okay.

45:51.380 --> 45:54.258
- Oh, you all right?
- Even enjoyed the card that came with it.

45:54.780 --> 45:57.533
Do you remember what you wrote
on the card, Frederick?

45:57.700 --> 45:59.770
Let's see, was it something like:

45:59.940 --> 46:02.693
"Happy anniversary, I hope you
choke on your meal"?

46:06.580 --> 46:08.138
Now you're just being silly.

46:08.300 --> 46:10.860
Have some gravy, darling.
The potatoes are awfully dry.

46:11.020 --> 46:14.376
Phyllis, I wish you wouldn't do that,
because Nicholas needs to lose weight.

46:14.540 --> 46:15.859
He's perfect!

46:16.020 --> 46:19.171
You're looking at a man who can
fly around the world in a single night.

46:20.300 --> 46:22.018
- That's unbelievable!
- Okay, Mom.

46:22.260 --> 46:25.935
You know, I can never get over that,
Nicholas. I just... You amaze me.

46:26.100 --> 46:28.489
- Isn't it amazing?
- I think it's absolutely amazing.

46:28.660 --> 46:31.618
To think that he can fly around
to a million houses in one night...

46:31.780 --> 46:34.214
...breaking and entering,
staring at little children...

46:34.380 --> 46:36.291
...eat the little kids' cookies and stuff.

46:36.460 --> 46:39.497
That's a phenomenal occurrence.
And I get jacked out of my mind...

46:39.660 --> 46:43.016
...just thinking about all those laws
being broken. Don't you guys feel it?

46:43.180 --> 46:45.978
Frederick, why are you so upset?

46:46.260 --> 46:48.376
Oh, come on, Mom. Don't...

46:49.260 --> 46:51.820
I just wish you were a little more
like your brother.

46:52.060 --> 46:54.016
Great. Okay.

46:54.180 --> 46:57.252
I have a feeling I'd be much more
comfortable back in my little hut...

46:57.420 --> 46:59.536
...with some Hot Pockets
and a milkshake.

46:59.740 --> 47:01.810
Come on. Don't be like that. Fred.

47:06.060 --> 47:09.848
I just love meeting people's families.
I find it so...

47:11.100 --> 47:12.294
...revealing.

47:16.460 --> 47:17.973
Night, Frosty! See you tomorrow!

47:22.380 --> 47:26.055
- Fred! Terrific! Come on in, my friend.
- How are you, Willie?

47:26.260 --> 47:28.012
I'm great! Pull up a stool.

47:28.380 --> 47:29.859
Hey, eggnog for Fred, Frosty.

47:30.020 --> 47:31.976
- Sure, they're on the way.
- Make it a double.

47:32.140 --> 47:33.255
Thank you.

47:37.500 --> 47:38.489
Hey, Fred.

47:44.860 --> 47:46.213
- Charlene.
- Yeah.

47:49.380 --> 47:52.292
You know, you see these
people after work...

47:52.460 --> 47:56.055
...and I don't even recognize them. You
know, like, "Oh, of course. Charlene."

47:56.220 --> 47:58.450
- Yeah.
- Good night, Fred.

48:00.060 --> 48:02.620
- Good night, Charlene.
- Good night...

48:05.020 --> 48:06.772
- Willie.
- Willie.

48:11.300 --> 48:14.576
Fred, I don't... I don't...

48:15.380 --> 48:17.132
I don't understand, Fred.

48:17.540 --> 48:19.371
She doesn't remember my name?

48:19.740 --> 48:22.698
What is it, Fred? Is it...? It's me, isn't it?

48:22.860 --> 48:25.738
You can tell me, Fred, it's okay.
Because you're my friend.

48:25.900 --> 48:28.130
It's just that... She thinks I'm a freak.

48:28.980 --> 48:31.335
I love her. I love her.

48:32.940 --> 48:36.012
Willie, now look. You love to laugh.
You're a lot of fun to be around.

48:36.180 --> 48:38.569
Fred, I can't even tell a joke.

48:38.740 --> 48:41.857
I say the last line first. I'm afraid
everyone's gonna stop listening.

48:42.020 --> 48:43.453
This thing is very easy.

48:43.620 --> 48:47.533
Let her know that you're ready for fun,
and you are not gonna apologize for it.

48:50.820 --> 48:53.209
You know, at last year's
after-Christmas party...

48:53.380 --> 48:55.132
...I almost asked her to dance.

48:55.300 --> 48:57.370
Then I remembered I can't dance.

48:58.460 --> 49:00.928
- Yet.
- What?

49:01.580 --> 49:02.933
Can't dance yet.

49:09.540 --> 49:12.100
Fred. I feel ridiculous.

49:12.260 --> 49:15.013
I don't know how to dance.
I don't know the steps.

49:15.180 --> 49:18.377
This is very uncomfortable for me.

49:18.540 --> 49:21.293
Come on. Get out of your head
for a second. Get into your body!

49:21.740 --> 49:24.618
Okay, see, I'm not gonna do that.
I can't actually do that.

49:24.780 --> 49:27.340
We're no longer talking with this,
we're gonna talk with...

49:27.500 --> 49:28.774
Bring it. Bring it right now.

49:28.940 --> 49:32.296
Bring all that green goodness that you
have on and bring it right up on me.

49:32.460 --> 49:35.691
Come on, this beautiful green angel.
Now, put one hand here.

49:35.860 --> 49:38.613
Great. Put another hand here.
Come on, grip it. Don't be shy.

49:38.780 --> 49:40.930
All we're gonna do
is a little bit of a baby sway.

49:41.100 --> 49:43.660
That's it, just a gentle rock
back and forth. Just easy.

49:43.820 --> 49:45.697
Now, you got short arms,
which is good...

49:45.860 --> 49:47.657
...because it means you gotta get close.

49:47.820 --> 49:50.698
So go ahead, pull this big tugboat
to shore. Anchors aweigh.

49:52.020 --> 49:56.810
That's it. Okay, now, the next thing
you do is put your hand on my back.

49:57.980 --> 50:00.335
That's not my back,
but it is a little bit naughty.

50:00.500 --> 50:04.209
I like where you're headed, but for these
purposes, let's just keep it professional.

50:04.380 --> 50:05.972
- Fred.
- Now, remember, Willie...

50:06.140 --> 50:08.859
...dancing is not about dancing, right?

50:09.020 --> 50:11.818
It's about connecting.
Now, look me in the eye.

50:12.780 --> 50:16.136
Great. Now, if I was a girl, I'd get goose
bumps with what you just brought.

50:16.620 --> 50:20.249
The other great thing about dancing
is it's the perfect bridge to a kiss.

50:20.500 --> 50:23.333
So all you gotta do is have fun,
let me know I can have fun...

50:23.500 --> 50:26.572
...and then when the time's right,
that's when you make your move.

50:26.740 --> 50:29.652
Get my blood pumping. Start to feel it.

50:30.020 --> 50:31.453
Get your blood pumping!

50:31.700 --> 50:34.134
Let's get excited. Let's make it happen.

50:34.300 --> 50:37.656
Come on, big guy. Turn around
and show me what you don't know.

50:37.820 --> 50:41.893
That's it. Okay. That's one way
to look at it. Keep moving it, baby.

50:42.060 --> 50:45.211
That's it. Keep rolling. There's no rules.
I like it. You're making it happen.

50:45.380 --> 50:49.214
You're dancing. That's okay,
and it's not okay, and it's okay!

51:01.860 --> 51:03.259
Feel it! Stay with it.

51:03.420 --> 51:07.698
Wind it up. I like it! Heat it up.
Work it harder! Stay with it, brother!

51:25.180 --> 51:26.852
Oh, I forgot my gloves.

51:28.140 --> 51:30.210
It's okay. Just get up calmly.

51:38.700 --> 51:40.133
That's all right...

51:40.420 --> 51:41.739
Willie!

51:55.500 --> 51:56.979
So you fell down, big deal.

51:57.140 --> 52:00.974
Fred, not everybody falls down
on his face in front of the girl he loves.

52:01.140 --> 52:04.416
I looked like a total idiot out there.

52:04.580 --> 52:07.652
How am I ever gonna be seen
in public again? It's ridiculous.

52:07.820 --> 52:11.415
Thank goodness Blitzen didn't feel that
way the first time he learned how to fly.

52:11.620 --> 52:14.578
When Blitzen learned to f...?
Why don't I know this story?

52:14.740 --> 52:17.334
Oh, come off it, Willie.
Everyone knows this story.

52:17.540 --> 52:20.612
- When Blitzen learned to fly?
- He fell on his face.

52:21.060 --> 52:22.652
- He did?
- He'd try and take a run... Yeah.

52:22.820 --> 52:24.697
He'd run and he'd fall flat on his face.

52:25.100 --> 52:27.170
But he picked himself up
and he'd keep trying.

52:27.340 --> 52:30.730
And eventually,
he stopped thinking and he flew.

52:31.100 --> 52:34.217
- It's common knowledge.
- Fred, come on.

52:34.380 --> 52:36.769
- It's true.
- I'm not Blitzen, though. I'm no Blitzen.

52:36.940 --> 52:38.498
Well, I disagree with you, Willie.

52:40.140 --> 52:42.574
I know you got more
Blitzen in you than you realize.

52:44.820 --> 52:46.412
Love is so complicated.

52:47.500 --> 52:48.853
Yeah, can be.

52:50.220 --> 52:51.255
It hurts.

52:52.940 --> 52:54.214
I'm proud of you, Willie.

52:56.780 --> 52:58.054
Now, good night.

52:59.060 --> 53:00.459
Good night, Fred.

53:24.460 --> 53:29.215
Oh, Fred. Oh, where, oh, where
did all the kids' letters go?

53:34.100 --> 53:36.933
Oh, isn't that sweet?
Lucy wants a cooking set.

53:37.100 --> 53:40.456
Well, here's how you make pasta, darling.
There's a start.

53:42.620 --> 53:46.579
Oh, little Keenan Adams
wants a bike for Christmas.

53:46.740 --> 53:49.891
Well, Keenan, I guess you'll be taking
the bus to school from now on.

53:51.660 --> 53:56.131
<i>Oh, Freddie, Freddie, you have been</i>
<i>so very, very naughty.</i>

53:59.860 --> 54:03.216
I didn't take any of the files
out of the room. I never got to the S's.

54:03.380 --> 54:06.417
Fred, I don't need to tell you how
very important these files are.

54:07.500 --> 54:11.015
Without them, we have no idea
what the children want.

54:11.180 --> 54:13.250
Or whether they've been marked
Naughty or Nice.

54:13.420 --> 54:16.696
And it was your responsibility,
of course, to keep track of them.

54:16.900 --> 54:20.449
I just told you, I would know if l...
I didn't take any... What is going on here?

54:20.860 --> 54:23.772
And why are you standing there
judging me with your arms folded?

54:23.940 --> 54:25.578
I'm not judging you, I'm nervous.

54:25.740 --> 54:29.130
I'd be nervous too if I was up to no
good. Doth who protests the most.

54:29.300 --> 54:31.131
- Can you believe this guy?
- Okay. Come on.

54:31.300 --> 54:33.609
- I got my eye on you, Bob.
- Yeah? Anytime, big fella.

54:33.780 --> 54:34.769
Bob, settle down.

54:34.940 --> 54:37.454
You wanna talk like an elf,
you have to act like an elf.

54:37.620 --> 54:39.019
- I'm easy to find.
- Big talk.

54:39.180 --> 54:41.410
He's got a bigger reach than you, Bob.

54:46.060 --> 54:48.130
- Trouble?
- No, no, no.

54:48.300 --> 54:51.895
No? Nobody in Wisconsin's
gonna get any gifts this year!

54:56.100 --> 54:58.898
Oh, my, my. Those poor children.

54:59.060 --> 55:01.255
You don't have any backup records?

55:01.900 --> 55:04.130
Well, we've never had
something like this happen.

55:04.300 --> 55:08.452
I'm sure that they'll turn up. I mean, after
all, where could they have possibly gone?

55:08.620 --> 55:11.657
Failure to administrate backup records.

55:11.820 --> 55:12.935
That would be strike two.

55:14.940 --> 55:17.056
Look, this is probably
none of my business...

55:17.220 --> 55:19.529
...but I'm a little concerned about Fred.

55:20.300 --> 55:24.134
Well, I appreciate your concern,
Mr. Northcutt, but he is fine.

55:24.300 --> 55:27.849
It's just that I've seen these
kind of things before. The little lies...

55:28.460 --> 55:29.734
...flashes of anger.

55:30.060 --> 55:33.416
No, I can assure you, he's fine.

55:33.620 --> 55:36.418
Well, but it could get
so much worse, Santa.

55:36.580 --> 55:39.697
Tell me, has he asked for
large sums of money recently?

55:39.940 --> 55:42.579
And what about trouble?

55:43.020 --> 55:45.250
Has he gotten into trouble with the law?

55:45.420 --> 55:47.775
Why, yes, Mr. Northcutt, yes, he has.

55:47.940 --> 55:51.979
Of course. He's crying out for help.

55:52.140 --> 55:54.415
And if someone doesn't
step in and help him, why...

55:54.580 --> 55:56.411
...I'm afraid it's gonna get ugly.

55:56.780 --> 55:59.578
Well, what can I do, Mr. Northcutt?

56:00.100 --> 56:03.934
I did have a thought.
But Fred's not going to like it.

56:10.060 --> 56:12.335
What kind of party
are you dudes throwing?

56:22.700 --> 56:26.295
Airmail it! Airmail it to me right now!
Let's get jacked up!

57:06.180 --> 57:10.014
What are you, nuts? I feel like
Patty Hearst! I was just abducted, Nick!

57:10.180 --> 57:11.818
You're gonna have to pay something...

57:12.100 --> 57:14.136
...to make up for the hurt
I have inside of me.

57:14.300 --> 57:18.179
It's not gonna be cheap. I got a lawyer
that's got vowels in his last name, Nick.

57:18.340 --> 57:23.016
He's gonna contact you and make you
feel the hurt I feel from your handlers!

57:23.180 --> 57:25.774
Frederick!
We're having a family intervention.

57:25.940 --> 57:28.500
Your behavior has been unacceptable.

57:32.380 --> 57:35.577
- Wanda, hi.
- Hi. You all right?

57:35.740 --> 57:38.857
I'm doing terrific. I'm doing great.
How've you been?

57:39.020 --> 57:42.057
You know, I've been all right.
Yeah, I've been working and...

57:42.220 --> 57:46.452
That's awesome. Work is really good for
someone to do when they're doing stuff.

57:46.620 --> 57:49.930
I've been working a lot, too, by the way.
And also fighting for my life.

57:52.860 --> 57:54.930
My brother's Santa Claus.

57:56.300 --> 57:59.098
Yeah, yeah. I can... I can see that.

57:59.260 --> 58:02.457
It's a little different.

58:02.620 --> 58:05.054
Yeah, the whole thing's been
a little bit unusual.

58:05.540 --> 58:08.737
Fred, your brother has flown
someone in we think can help you.

58:09.020 --> 58:11.011
- This is Dr. Goldfarb.
- Hello.

58:11.180 --> 58:14.172
Your erratic behavior is putting
too much stress on your brother.

58:14.340 --> 58:18.128
Mom, for Pete's sake, okay,
I'm not stressed out about it.

58:18.300 --> 58:20.131
- Nick! You're falling apart.
- I am not.

58:20.300 --> 58:22.256
Yes, you are.
You're dangerously overweight.

58:22.420 --> 58:23.569
He is not!

58:23.740 --> 58:26.300
You have no idea
what your son is going through!

58:26.460 --> 58:28.974
- Okay.
- He is a terrible closet eater.

58:29.140 --> 58:32.450
He has developed
acid reflux and sleep apnea.

58:32.620 --> 58:35.578
- I snore. I mean, people snore.
- It is keeping him up all night...

58:35.740 --> 58:39.289
...and it's affecting his health, not to
mention other aspects of our marriage.

58:39.460 --> 58:40.609
Oh, ho, ho, Annette.

58:40.780 --> 58:42.896
He's having a tough time
getting off the ground?

58:44.580 --> 58:45.729
I'm just saying.

58:46.700 --> 58:48.418
Please, let's just cut to the chase.

58:48.580 --> 58:51.048
It's simple, it's always
the same thing with you, Fred.

58:51.660 --> 58:53.491
- You cause problems.
- Sweetie...

58:53.700 --> 58:54.928
And then you make excuses...

58:55.100 --> 58:57.853
...like, you know, you're looking
out for someone else.

58:58.020 --> 58:59.419
Ever since he was a little boy.

58:59.580 --> 59:02.970
I couldn't have said it any better.
Freddie, that is what you do.

59:03.140 --> 59:06.371
That's great. Do me a favor, please.
Why don't you just stay out of this?

59:06.540 --> 59:09.008
Well, I came for the intervention.
Your family asked me.

59:09.180 --> 59:11.933
Don't you have a date with a guy
who forgot to plug his meter?

59:12.100 --> 59:13.658
Have you been spying on me?

59:13.820 --> 59:15.458
- Yes.
- You got nothing better to do?

59:15.620 --> 59:18.259
- I don't like what I saw.
- If you spied on me properly...

59:18.420 --> 59:21.139
...you would know I didn't end up going
out with that guy.

59:21.300 --> 59:24.736
Let me just say this to you.
It is not flattering on your character...

59:24.900 --> 59:27.334
...to see you with a man
who's got liver-spotted hands.

59:27.500 --> 59:29.809
It's a very weak choice.
It makes you look weak.

59:29.980 --> 59:31.857
Look, I can tell you
what your problem is.

59:32.020 --> 59:35.376
You won't let anybody love you because
you don't think you're worth loving.

59:35.540 --> 59:36.689
If it pleases the court...

59:36.860 --> 59:39.374
...did you have an older gentleman
ask you out on a date?

59:39.540 --> 59:42.054
Yes, but that's not the point!
I didn't see him again!

59:42.220 --> 59:44.575
- Then she's a dater.
- You push and fix on one thing.

59:44.740 --> 59:46.458
Then stop dating. Put down the phone.

59:46.620 --> 59:48.099
That's it. I've had enough.

59:48.260 --> 59:52.094
Excuse me, Mr. Santa Claus. It's been
very pleasant to come to the North Pole...

59:52.260 --> 59:53.818
...and, yeah.

59:53.980 --> 59:56.619
Go find a date. Maybe get lucky
with an elf on the way out.

59:56.780 --> 59:58.133
Good luck. Hope it goes well.

59:58.300 --> 01:00:01.497
Well, there's a lot of mistletoe
out there, so you should be psyched.

01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:02.729
Fred.

01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:07.137
I think we're making some real progress.

01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:10.929
You wanna know what the good news is
about all of this? Tomorrow's my last day.

01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:12.613
We don't have to have therapy.

01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:16.819
It's for people who want to be in each
other's lives. We don't have that problem.

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:19.892
I'm gonna finish my job,
I'll be out of your lives forever.

01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:32.375
Nice night.

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:35.179
Get lost, guy.

01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:40.135
Santa Claus' brother,
that must be a tough beat.

01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:42.975
My brother's a doctor.
I never hear the end of it.

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:45.700
Half the time,
I feel like I don't even exist.

01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:48.135
And the way your whole family
treats you.

01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:50.858
What's your story, man?

01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:52.449
Excuse me?

01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:56.571
Look, whatever you're trying to do
with me here's not gonna work.

01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:58.856
Well, what exactly am I trying?

01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:03.059
I don't know what it is you're into, but
something's real creepy about you...

01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:04.733
...and ever since you got here...

01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:07.130
...my brother's been getting
a little bit nervous.

01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:08.699
That's wonderful.

01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:11.288
What is wonderful?

01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:13.690
You take an interest
in your brother's well-being.

01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:16.169
Of course you do.
I'm sure he does the same for you.

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:17.773
- Clyde...
- You ever seen a tree...

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:19.931
...that grows in the shadow
of another tree?

01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:23.536
It's all puny and misshapen because
it's just bending and twisting...

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:26.373
...trying so desperately
to get some sunlight.

01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:30.650
If somebody just cut off a few feet
of that big tree...

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:32.617
...that little tree could grow up strong.

01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:35.214
But no, that's not the way
life works, right?

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:38.852
They all love that big tree, right?
They're all proud of that one.

01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:41.534
They hate the crap out of
the little one next to it.

01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:45.093
The little tree that refuses to grow right.

01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:48.930
And you know what? Till somebody comes
along and cuts down that big tree...

01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:52.729
...that little tree is never
gonna get any light. Any light.

01:01:57.260 --> 01:01:59.535
I'm sorry.
I don't know where that came from.

01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:02.288
Christmas.

01:02:02.460 --> 01:02:03.779
Have a nice night.

01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:23.538
What the hell was that?

01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:27.052
Looks like a new kid just took over
the number one Most Naughty spot.

01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:33.615
Slam?

01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:37.930
Samuel Gibbons, Chicago, Illinois.

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:44.738
What are you asking Santa for?

01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:47.694
- A family.
- I'm asking for a family too.

01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:52.814
Santa's not bringing y'all families.
Santa Claus is a clown.

01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:54.459
He's a fame junkie.

01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:56.571
<i>He puts on a big red suit...</i>

01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:58.856
...and rides around the town
with reindeer.

01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:01.416
It's because the man
is desperate for attention.

01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:03.457
<i>The dude needs to be in the spotlight.</i>

01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:07.818
<i>There's more Santa statues in the</i>
<i>world than Buddha. It's a shell game.</i>

01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:09.572
Y'all drank all the Kool-Aid, fools!

01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:13.369
You just know you're never
getting adopted because you're mean!

01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:18.498
- Break it up! You're gonna get in trouble!
- Get off me! Get off!

01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:21.613
- Break it up! Break it up!
- Get off!

01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:23.577
Somebody's gonna get in trouble!

01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:26.856
<i>I don 't care. I'm Slam!</i>

01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:18.016
Santa, I ran the numbers three times.

01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:19.933
Yeah.

01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:22.375
Charlene, mention this to no one.

01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:25.692
- Especially Clyde Northcutt.
- Yes, sir.

01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:30.295
Fred!

01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:34.375
What the blazes have you done?

01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:38.249
You marked every naughty child as nice!

01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:39.819
Are you out of your mind?

01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:42.619
- None of the kids seemed naughty to me.
- Good grief, Fred!

01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:45.738
You really never see the ramifications
of anything, do you?

01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:49.490
We literally cannot make enough
presents with only three days left.

01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:52.299
We cannot deliver all of those presents!

01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:55.532
Do you see? It's over.
Congratulations, Fred!

01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:58.692
You've cost Christmas
for the whole planet! Everybody!

01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:02.136
Lithuania, everywhere in Africa,
the whole thing!

01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:03.653
Right down the crapper!

01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:06.813
Blame it all on me, right?
It's all my fault. How convenient.

01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:10.734
Annette was right about you.
Mom was right about you!

01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:12.128
You know what, save it!

01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:14.575
Maybe you should look
at your own self for a change!

01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:18.653
You just keep stuffing your face
with gingerbread! Fat boy!

01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:28.417
You slick-talking, fast-talking punk!

01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:33.574
You know I've been battling a weight
problem for years, Fred! That is not funny!

01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:36.300
You know what?
You can shove it, Thunder Thighs!

01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:39.133
I'm sick of it. This little tree's
gonna get some light.

01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:41.291
This tree's gonna chop
that big tree down!

01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:43.018
I don't have to take your abuse!

01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:44.898
Nick, I couldn't miss you if I tried!

01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:47.699
I couldn't miss you if I tried
because you're so fat!

01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:51.296
You throw like a girl,
like a big, leather jacket-wearing girl.

01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:52.973
Come on, Nick.

01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:55.210
Come on, fat boy!

01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:57.098
How'd you get to work today? You roll?

01:05:57.260 --> 01:06:00.252
How'd you get here? Did you steal
a sled from some little kid?

01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:02.089
Come on!

01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:13.251
Good night, sweet prince.

01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:30.457
Don't bring a snowmobile
to a snowball fight, Nick!

01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:39.814
You gonna run me over?
Are you gonna run me over?

01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:12.809
I never realized it before.

01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:18.169
You hate me.

01:07:20.300 --> 01:07:22.256
I don't hate you, Nick.

01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:27.017
I just wish you were never born.

01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:32.293
Yeah.

01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:51.169
Clyde Northcutt is not from
Human Resources, Fred.

01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:54.416
He's an efficiency expert.

01:07:56.300 --> 01:08:00.498
And he is one strike away
from shutting me down.

01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:03.733
Permanently.

01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:31.251
Well, I hope you're happy
with yourself, Fred.

01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:33.569
Look, Annette, I want my money.
A deal's a deal.

01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:37.091
Yeah.

01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:39.615
Personally,
I don't think you deserve a cent.

01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:44.654
He wanted you to have this too.

01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:49.859
Merry Christmas, Fred.

01:08:56.779 --> 01:08:58.133
Let's go, Willie.

01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:02.419
Well, well.

01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:07.091
Mr. Northcutt.

01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:09.939
You wanted to see me, sir.

01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:11.089
Yes, I did.

01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:14.139
Bring up Fred Claus
from earlier today, please.

01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:37.572
Well, now, we can correct that.
We can correct that.

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:40.937
Charlene. We still have
plenty of time, don't we?

01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:43.295
With less than three days
to go until Christmas...

01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:45.849
...you now have no way
of making your quota.

01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:49.451
And I think you know what that means.

01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:52.180
Strike three.

01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:57.098
Look, it gives me no great pleasure
to have to say this, but...

01:09:57.260 --> 01:10:01.333
Well, actually, who am I kidding,
this is a fantastic moment for me!

01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:20.097
You're fired.

01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:31.176
<i>Hey, Fred, it's Leon. It's the 22nd.</i>
<i>This is your big day, buddy!</i>

01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:34.730
<i>Get that 50 G's in my hands!</i>
<i>Call me back. Let's do this.</i>

01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:29.375
And I feel this way all the time. It's not
like I didn't want my brother to succeed.

01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:32.657
We were very close growing up.
I mean, we shared bunk beds.

01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:34.890
He was my roadie,
used to carry my amps.

01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:37.814
And my mother always told me,
since I was a little kid:

01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:41.734
"You're gonna support your brother."
And so that was gonna be my job.

01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:45.893
And then <i>Rocky</i> came out,
and things changed, you know?

01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:48.255
I was the first guy in line.
I mean, I was there.

01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:50.854
And then when <i>Rocky III</i> came out...

01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:53.739
...I was starting to wonder who
Frank Stallone was, you know?

01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:55.413
It was, like, identity theft.

01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:57.810
You're fighting Rambo
and you're fighting Rocky...

01:11:57.980 --> 01:12:01.211
...and trying to keep them at bay
so you can get you to come through.

01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:04.737
Well, anyway, I wanna
thank you guys for listening.

01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:07.175
I feel good coming here. I like it here.

01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:10.298
Wonderful. Thanks for sharing, Frank.

01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:14.135
Okay. Now, I think we go to Roger.

01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:17.572
I actually have some things
I'd like to talk about if...

01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:20.049
Okay, you're just gonna have
to wait your turn.

01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:23.849
Roger's been waiting, and we didn't get
to him last time, so we'll go to Roger.

01:12:24.020 --> 01:12:27.808
- I have a lot of stuff boiling now, so...
- I appreciate that. After Roger.

01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:31.014
- Okay.
- Roger?

01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:33.451
I'm Roger, I'm a recovering sibling.

01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:35.258
Hi, Roger.

01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:37.058
My brother's Bill Clinton.

01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:40.608
My brother was the
president of the United States.

01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:43.693
You know, I was flipping
through the channels on the TV...

01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:49.014
...and on the History Channel was the
State of the Union Address from 1993.

01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:54.129
When we left the White House, I thought
it was gonna be the first step to recovery.

01:12:54.740 --> 01:12:58.050
But no, I started to cry again.

01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:04.093
And I just don't know if I'm ever, you
know, gonna be able to fully recover now.

01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:07.570
Maybe that's a place where I could
jump in, share what's going on with me.

01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:09.776
- Who are you?
- I'm Fred.

01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:12.454
- Hi, Fred.
- Hi.

01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:15.051
Go ahead.
Would you like to take a turn now?

01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:18.458
- My name is Fred Claus.
- Hi, Fred.

01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:20.369
Hi.

01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:25.458
I'm Santa Claus' brother.

01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:29.656
And I got a lot of stuff
going on because of it.

01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:34.138
There's a lot of things...
There's a lot of juice in the tank over it.

01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:36.814
- And...
- Is this a joke to you?

01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:39.130
- Stephen, by the way.
- Hi, Stephen.

01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:40.449
Hey, guys, what's up?

01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:44.852
I mean, because this isn't funny
to all of us here in the group.

01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:46.897
Okay, this is very serious to us.

01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:50.575
And I'm feeling very uncomfortable
with where you're coming from.

01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:52.810
Wait, Stephen...

01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:56.211
...maybe to him,
his brother is Santa Claus.

01:13:56.420 --> 01:13:57.978
Feel like my brother's Santa Claus.

01:13:58.140 --> 01:14:02.213
But I feel like my brother's Santa Claus
because my brother really is Santa Claus.

01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:05.053
All right, that's enough, all right!
You and I got a problem!

01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:09.095
Stephen, easy, easy.
All right. Stephen, easy.

01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:12.775
That's not Alec, okay?

01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:14.612
Don't look at me, look at him.

01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:16.894
That's not Alec.

01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:18.369
That's not Alec.

01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:20.691
I'm not Alec, you know what I mean?

01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:22.418
All right, let's stomp it out.

01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:24.377
- It's not Alec.
- Alec's not gonna hear.

01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:25.575
How's he gonna...?

01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:28.089
- That's not Alec.
- Okay, that's not Alec.

01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:30.137
- That's not Alec!
- That's not Alec!

01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:32.650
- That's not Alec!
- All right!

01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:36.779
Now that you've got Alec's attention,
Stephen, what do you wanna tell him?

01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:42.136
Stephen, I think I know
where you're coming from...

01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:45.019
...because I used to be really,
really angry with my brother.

01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:50.176
I didn't want to become first brother,
especially for the rest of my life.

01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:53.810
I couldn't control being brother
of the president of the United States.

01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:57.417
But I could control
being Bill Clinton's brother.

01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:01.016
And I made the decision, even though
I could have brought the house down...

01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:04.695
...I made the decision that,
for the love of my brother...

01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:07.328
...and for the love of my family name...

01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:10.370
...that I was gonna do whatever it took...

01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:13.496
...because I loved my brother...

01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:17.812
...and I was always gonna be there
for my brother. And I have been.

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:19.652
And you know what?

01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:21.219
You can be too.

01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:28.618
The Travel Experts?

01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:31.817
Yeah. I need to get to the
North Pole right away, like, tonight.

01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:36.298
Yeah, I got $50,000 in cash
that says I'm not kidding.

01:15:55.620 --> 01:15:58.532
- Oh, North Pole! North Pole.
- North Pole is there?

01:15:58.700 --> 01:16:00.418
Safe journeys to you, and thank you!

01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:32.613
Willie, gather all the elves and meet me
in the Workshop right now. Let's go.

01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:37.219
Look, guys...

01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:41.339
...we gotta make as many presents
as we can in the next 10 hours.

01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:42.774
Fred, it's Christmas Eve.

01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:48.014
It's impossible. We just can't build
that many toys in that time.

01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:50.694
The rule says that every kid gets a toy.

01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:54.933
So, what would be the easiest toy
to make? One for boys and one for girls.

01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:57.216
- A baseball bat.
- A Hula-Hoop.

01:16:57.380 --> 01:16:59.894
Well, baseball bats
and Hula-Hoops it is, then.

01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:04.134
Charlene, do you think it's possible we
can make enough gifts to meet our quota?

01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:07.292
Baseball bats, lose four seconds, 55...

01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:10.931
Yeah, it is possible.

01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:14.257
It is, but, Fred, that's not what
the kids asked for.

01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:17.737
Yeah, but all that matters is that each
of the kids get a toy.

01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:21.779
That they have something that they can
open when they wake up in the morning.

01:17:21.940 --> 01:17:25.774
Most importantly, they all know there's
somebody who's thinking about them.

01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:29.573
You guys have never missed
a Christmas before.

01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:33.099
If you guys are gonna go out this year...

01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:36.736
...you're gonna go out trying.

01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:57.731
Okay. We're on it.

01:17:58.660 --> 01:18:00.651
- I've never seen him...
- That's because he's...

01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:03.334
...thrown his back out.
- No.

01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:05.695
- Hey, Annette, how you doing?
- Fred.

01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:09.495
Nick, I think we're gonna make it. I got
elves in the Workshop making presents.

01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:11.855
We're cutting corners,
but I think we can make it.

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:15.057
You'll still be able to save Christmas.
We don't have a lot of time.

01:18:15.220 --> 01:18:18.690
That's impossible. The man
can hardly carry his own weight.

01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:20.652
I can't move.

01:18:22.860 --> 01:18:24.816
I can't, Fred.

01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:27.652
You can do it. It's Christmas, come on.

01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:31.893
- The kids are out there, counting on us.
- Oh, boy, I wish I could.

01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:36.698
Willie, this is your big night.
This is your big night, pal.

01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:38.930
You're gonna deliver the presents.
Willie can.

01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:40.772
No, Fred, I can't.

01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:43.010
Of course you can.
You're great on that sleigh.

01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:46.138
No, no, you don't understand.
I can't do it. There's a rule.

01:18:46.300 --> 01:18:49.417
Only a Claus can deliver the presents.

01:18:59.740 --> 01:19:02.857
Do you guys mind giving me just a
moment alone with my brother here?

01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:10.689
Yeah.

01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:16.978
I can't do that, Nick.
I think you know that.

01:19:19.740 --> 01:19:23.130
I'm not capable.
I'm not even comfortable flying...

01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:25.894
...or being a passenger,
let alone trying to fly the sleigh.

01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:28.654
- I don't know my way around reindeer...
- Hey, Fred.

01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:31.573
It's all right.

01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:37.179
It's ridiculous for anybody to expect
that kind of thing. No.

01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:39.896
You can't do that. You can't.

01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:43.778
It's too huge. Believe me, I know.

01:19:48.980 --> 01:19:51.574
And I would never ask you
to do that, Fred.

01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:55.651
It's all right.

01:19:55.820 --> 01:19:57.492
It is all right.

01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:15.815
Nick, there's been one thing that's been
eating at me since I've been here.

01:20:16.460 --> 01:20:18.894
That Naughty-Nice List that you got?

01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:22.736
There's no naughty kids, Nick.

01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:24.979
They're all good kids.

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:27.531
But some of them are scared.

01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:29.930
And some of them don't feel listened to.

01:20:30.140 --> 01:20:32.779
Some of them had some
pretty tough breaks too.

01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:38.379
But every kid deserves
a present on Christmas.

01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:17.416
Yeah.

01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:35.691
Africa plus Asia, plus Europe,
North America, South America.

01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:37.179
It's gonna be close.

01:21:37.340 --> 01:21:39.331
Let's go, people! Let's pick up the pace!

01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:55.335
Red Fred has entered the building. I
repeat, Red Fred has entered the building.

01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:57.650
Willie, let's go.

01:22:09.380 --> 01:22:13.214
What the heck's going on around here?
Little elves. You can't trust them at all!

01:22:13.380 --> 01:22:14.415
The little tiny people.

01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:19.135
Nice outfit. What the heck
do you think you're doing?

01:22:19.300 --> 01:22:20.779
- Delivering presents.
- Oh, no.

01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:22.692
Santa is the only one who can deliver.

01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:25.328
Only a Claus can deliver presents
and that is a Claus.

01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:29.289
If you think I'm gonna let you get away
with this, you are sadly mistaken.

01:22:29.740 --> 01:22:32.698
If you don't get out of the way
of this sleigh in three seconds...

01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:34.771
...I'll be the happiest guy
in the North Pole.

01:22:34.940 --> 01:22:37.056
You don't have the guts.

01:22:37.220 --> 01:22:38.369
Okay.

01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:40.938
Three...

01:22:41.260 --> 01:22:42.659
...two...

01:22:42.820 --> 01:22:44.697
- Willie, how do I do this?
- Just say "ho."

01:22:50.060 --> 01:22:53.769
- Good, Fred! Nice firm grip on those reins!
- What's happening now?

01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:57.410
Snap those reins, we gotta get this thing
in the air! Tell the guys to get up!

01:22:57.580 --> 01:22:58.569
Get up, get up, get up!

01:23:00.660 --> 01:23:03.572
There you go! You got it, Fred!
We're going up!

01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:07.529
- You're flying Santa's sleigh!
- We're flying. Now what's happening?

01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:09.418
- Watch the roof there.
- I can't do it!

01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:14.371
Do it to me, how do I steer this thing?

01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:17.577
We wanna go up! So you gotta
pull up on the reins there, Fred!

01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:19.173
Okay.

01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:34.657
Christmas One, do you copy?

01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:38.495
<i>North Pole, this is Christmas One.</i>
<i>We copy. We hear you loud and clear.</i>

01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:41.732
Sixty seconds and counting
for a landing, North Pole.

01:23:41.900 --> 01:23:43.492
Okay, we've got 10 hours, Fred.

01:23:43.660 --> 01:23:47.175
We need to be done delivering
by 5:38 a.m. North Pole time.

01:23:47.340 --> 01:23:49.296
That's sunrise, and that's game over.

01:23:49.460 --> 01:23:51.212
Going down this thing here, it's...

01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:54.092
It's gonna hurt a bit, isn't it?

01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:56.450
I'm not gonna lie to you.
It ain't gonna tickle.

01:23:56.660 --> 01:23:59.538
Oh, and one more thing,
make sure you eat all the cookies.

01:23:59.700 --> 01:24:02.658
- It hurts people's feelings if you don't.
- I got it.

01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:23.331
Head 12 degrees north into London.

01:24:23.660 --> 01:24:27.096
North Pole, this is Christmas One. We're
heading 12 degrees north into London.

01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:29.209
Stephen Harding.

01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:32.819
<i>Anna-Marie Gormley.</i>

01:24:34.020 --> 01:24:35.089
Done.

01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:40.533
Emma Short.

01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:49.290
We'll come back to this
neighborhood later.

01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:54.696
Go 20 degrees past Dallas
towards Lubbock.

01:24:54.900 --> 01:24:56.379
Roger that, North Pole.

01:25:08.700 --> 01:25:11.294
Christmas One, take your
heading off one-zero-niner.

01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:15.218
Fred, Fred, Fred!

01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:19.819
- Shake it off, Rudolph!
- You sure you've never done this?

01:25:19.980 --> 01:25:22.892
You're driving like an absolute pro
who makes a lot of mistakes.

01:25:28.580 --> 01:25:32.209
Oh, it's okay. Friendly, friendly, friendly.
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.

01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:33.769
Katherine Tibbett.

01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:36.898
<i>Christmas One, veer right 70 degrees</i>
<i>at the Empire State Building.</i>

01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:02.289
Next page.

01:26:14.060 --> 01:26:15.095
Have a slice of challah.

01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:17.933
Thank you so much.
I appreciate it. Mazel tov.

01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:20.489
And that knish?
Let me just have one of these.

01:26:20.660 --> 01:26:23.174
It's hard to pass these beauties up.
You're too generous.

01:26:27.580 --> 01:26:28.979
Kid.

01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:34.212
Santa! You found me!

01:26:34.380 --> 01:26:35.608
Yeah, I found you.

01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:38.690
I find all the good kids.

01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:42.336
Macaroni! It's you!

01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:43.899
Hi, boy.

01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:46.377
Come on, boy. Hi.

01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:48.292
Slam, I want you to listen to me...

01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:53.539
...you got some advice a while back,
and I think it was a little off.

01:26:55.660 --> 01:26:57.412
The world is what you make it.

01:26:58.660 --> 01:27:01.128
It all starts with what
you make of yourself.

01:27:02.460 --> 01:27:05.452
And I want you to
believe in yourself, Slam...

01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:07.497
...because you got a lot to believe in.

01:27:09.660 --> 01:27:13.209
And the rest will all...
All kind of fall into place.

01:27:13.380 --> 01:27:15.655
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:18.773
Merry Christmas, pal.

01:27:19.140 --> 01:27:20.493
Merry Christmas, Santa.

01:27:20.940 --> 01:27:24.216
- Oh, and Santa?
- Yeah.

01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:25.899
Here's your wallet back.

01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:31.968
That's a good start.

01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:34.938
Let's try and build some
real momentum with that, okay?

01:27:35.100 --> 01:27:36.135
Okay.

01:27:43.060 --> 01:27:44.493
I think we're gonna make it!

01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:49.650
Christmas One, are you there? Over.

01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:51.454
Are you there...?

01:27:55.740 --> 01:27:57.810
North Pole, go ahead,
this is Christmas One.

01:27:59.020 --> 01:28:02.535
Good luck finding your way
in the dark without a candle, Freddie.

01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:07.569
And as of right now, each and every one
of you little adorable munchkins is fired!

01:28:07.740 --> 01:28:10.049
So go home, pack up your stockings.

01:28:10.220 --> 01:28:13.337
You're taking a bus back to Elfistan
or wherever the hell you're from.

01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:14.535
North Pole?

01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:18.014
North Pole, this is Christmas One,
go ahead.

01:28:18.180 --> 01:28:19.408
Hey, guys!

01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:24.137
I think we're flying blind up here.

01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:53.055
By the time the sun rises,
it will all be over.

01:28:54.260 --> 01:28:55.613
See you in the morning.

01:28:56.700 --> 01:29:00.295
Clyde Archibald Northcutt...

01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:03.896
...422 Dashwood Drive...

01:29:05.460 --> 01:29:07.291
...Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

01:29:10.380 --> 01:29:14.055
Yeah, you made
the Most-Naughty list in '68.

01:29:14.220 --> 01:29:16.780
Oh, boy, that was a very,
very naughty year.

01:29:16.940 --> 01:29:20.171
- How could you possibly remember that?
- You asked me for a Superman cape.

01:29:21.540 --> 01:29:24.054
But I didn't give you
a Superman cape, did I?

01:29:27.820 --> 01:29:31.449
- Did you always wear glasses, Clyde?
- If you think this changes anything...

01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:33.133
Four-Eyed Clyde.

01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:36.452
- I bet that's what they called you.
- I don't know what you're talk...

01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:40.579
Oh, and do you think that after a while
of being called Four-Eyed Clyde...

01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:42.378
...you maybe got a little angry?

01:29:42.740 --> 01:29:46.415
Maybe you started a fight or two.
Maybe 10, maybe 12.

01:29:49.780 --> 01:29:52.340
So you asked me for something.

01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:53.694
A Superman cape.

01:29:54.220 --> 01:29:57.212
Because you thought that that
was gonna change everything.

01:29:57.380 --> 01:29:58.369
This is ridiculous.

01:29:58.540 --> 01:30:01.737
- So you decide to stay Four-Eyed Clyde?
- Because Clark Kent wore glasses!

01:30:02.220 --> 01:30:04.256
But when he turned into Superman...

01:30:05.620 --> 01:30:08.771
...he didn't need those
darn glasses anymore, did he?

01:30:10.340 --> 01:30:12.092
Oh, Clyde.

01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:17.257
It was wrong of me
not to give you that gift, Clyde.

01:30:17.420 --> 01:30:21.572
I fear that I had a very incorrect...

01:30:21.740 --> 01:30:24.459
...misguided understanding of...

01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:27.419
...naughty children.

01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:34.175
So this may be a little late.

01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:49.695
You wanna put it on?

01:30:52.020 --> 01:30:54.056
Mr. Claus, I'm a 45-year-old man,
I'm not...

01:30:54.220 --> 01:30:55.494
Put it on.

01:30:57.060 --> 01:30:58.413
For me.

01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:01.092
- Okay.
- Thattaboy.

01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:06.969
Glasses off.

01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:17.659
Now, I need your help.

01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:23.979
Do you know what you're doing?

01:31:24.940 --> 01:31:27.170
Quarter to 2 a.m. There's Ursa Minor.

01:31:27.340 --> 01:31:30.855
That means we should be
at longitude 38.25. That's four...

01:31:31.020 --> 01:31:32.533
Take a left! Take a left!

01:31:35.900 --> 01:31:37.970
I really, really need your help.

01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:41.934
I'm gonna need you to
turn the power back on, Superman.

01:31:43.660 --> 01:31:45.730
Now, I know that you can do this.

01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:49.575
You have to understand, I've already
submitted my report. It's final.

01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:52.300
If Fred doesn't deliver
all those presents by sunrise...

01:31:52.460 --> 01:31:55.179
...the North Pole will be shut down
forever. There's nothing...

01:31:55.340 --> 01:31:57.808
I understand that. I do.

01:31:57.980 --> 01:32:00.210
But what do you say we give him
his shot?

01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:04.335
Because he's not a naughty kid either.

01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:05.694
I'm trying to... Hold on!

01:32:05.860 --> 01:32:08.420
Just look outside!
That looks like the Grand Canyon!

01:32:08.580 --> 01:32:09.615
Isn't that it?

01:32:26.180 --> 01:32:27.329
Oh, boy.

01:32:38.340 --> 01:32:39.329
Fred, it's 4: 15.

01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:42.139
Look, I'm gonna tuck and go
as fast as I can, all right?

01:32:51.460 --> 01:32:52.449
Done, done.

01:32:58.900 --> 01:33:01.255
Snap the reins!
We need more speed at this altitude!

01:33:01.420 --> 01:33:03.854
- Going as fast as I can! Say when to turn!
- Now!

01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:14.849
Fred.

01:33:15.020 --> 01:33:17.250
I know, Willie, I know.

01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:35.260
Fred, I have a bad feeling about this.

01:34:49.580 --> 01:34:50.569
We did it.

01:35:04.380 --> 01:35:05.495
Willie.

01:35:15.380 --> 01:35:17.336
To the snow globe!

01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:17.690
You are the best big brother
anybody could ever ask for.

01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:49.457
- Fred?
- I brought you a Christmas gift.

01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:50.894
How'd you get in?

01:37:51.060 --> 01:37:53.096
I came down the chimney.

01:37:53.260 --> 01:37:56.138
Freddie, you can't just show up
dressed like Father Christmas...

01:37:56.300 --> 01:37:58.291
...and come down
somebody else's chimney.

01:37:58.460 --> 01:38:00.849
Actually, I can.
I've been doing that all night.

01:38:01.900 --> 01:38:05.688
Freddie, do you know what? I'm starting
to get a bit worried for you, right now...

01:38:05.860 --> 01:38:09.933
...because like you're standing here,
in my bedroom, wearing red.

01:38:10.700 --> 01:38:13.817
And, you know, it's getting like to be
sort of restraining order time.

01:38:13.980 --> 01:38:16.574
So, you look sort of tired and I know
that I'm very tired.

01:38:16.740 --> 01:38:20.176
So maybe I'll call you later, but right now
I think you should just go home.

01:38:20.340 --> 01:38:21.489
All right? Just go home.

01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:24.417
- I am home.
- You're what?

01:38:24.580 --> 01:38:28.255
I've given up my lease on my apartment.
I'm gonna be moving in here with you.

01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:31.054
But listen, take your time.
I want you to digest this...

01:38:31.220 --> 01:38:33.654
...and process things.
I could use a little sleep.

01:38:33.820 --> 01:38:38.132
I'll be right out in our breakfast nook area.
I'll be curled up in our breakfast nook.

01:38:38.300 --> 01:38:41.258
When you're ready, you come find me
here at home, at our house.

01:39:04.700 --> 01:39:09.296
This is no good. We can't go to bed when
we're arguing now that we live together.

01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:20.940
And I got a big surprise planned for you.

01:39:21.300 --> 01:39:23.211
Oh, no, Freddie, not
a big surprise, please.

01:39:23.780 --> 01:39:26.738
I think you're gonna change your mind
when you see this one.

01:39:33.980 --> 01:39:36.494
Freddie, is it all right
that we're doing this?

01:39:36.660 --> 01:39:39.174
- It's a company car. It's one of the perks.
- Okay.

01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:42.529
Oh, Freddie, it's unbelievable.

01:39:42.700 --> 01:39:44.930
- We're in Paris, baby.
- We're in Paris.

01:39:48.820 --> 01:39:53.291
<i>So, I bet you're wondering</i>
<i>what happened to everyone else.</i>

01:39:55.220 --> 01:39:59.372
<i>That Christmas turned out to be</i>
<i>one of the most successful ever.</i>

01:40:01.900 --> 01:40:05.688
<i>People everywhere</i>
<i>found themselves more satisfied...</i>

01:40:05.860 --> 01:40:07.498
<i>... and filled up than ever.</i>

01:40:07.660 --> 01:40:11.369
Good work, Hans, you've learned to use
the spreadsheet. That's wonderful work.

01:40:11.540 --> 01:40:15.294
<i>So Santa hired Clyde</i>
<i>on a consulting basis.</i>

01:40:20.780 --> 01:40:24.170
Oh, it's a nice sweater, Clyde.
Real nice sweater.

01:40:24.340 --> 01:40:28.652
<i>Clyde's efficiency ensured that the</i>
<i>North Pole never fell behind again.</i>

01:40:28.820 --> 01:40:32.051
<i>Even with every kid getting a present.</i>

01:40:32.460 --> 01:40:36.772
<i>Willie and Charlene found out</i>
<i>that kindred spirits and soul mates...</i>

01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:40.137
<i>... often come in all shapes and sizes.</i>

01:40:41.580 --> 01:40:45.095
<i>And Bob and Linda finally got e-mail.</i>

01:40:45.260 --> 01:40:49.333
Linda, where are all the new orders?

01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:52.810
I e-mailed you five minutes ago!

01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:56.939
Please, do not use
all caps all the time, okay?

01:40:57.100 --> 01:40:59.739
- Yeah, but...
- Not everything is that important.

01:41:00.860 --> 01:41:02.054
Love you.

01:41:02.540 --> 01:41:03.768
Love you back.

01:41:05.420 --> 01:41:07.138
You're jumping around like animals.

01:41:07.380 --> 01:41:09.814
What are you doing? Stop.
What do you got your hat on...?

01:41:09.980 --> 01:41:12.130
You don't have a video.
Wear your hat like a man.

01:41:12.300 --> 01:41:14.370
Turn your hat around.
Put your hat on straight.

01:41:14.540 --> 01:41:16.576
You wear it like this to block the sun.

01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:18.492
When you're eating, take your hats off.

01:41:19.020 --> 01:41:21.250
She's right. Show respect.
Take off your hat!

01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:23.809
Don't forget "man"
is also in the word "manners."

01:41:23.980 --> 01:41:26.335
Bring it in for a team chant here. Ready?
On three!

01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:28.855
One, two, three, kill them!

01:41:29.180 --> 01:41:32.217
<i>Fred never stopped watching over Slam.</i>

01:41:35.820 --> 01:41:40.940
<i>And by the next Christmas,</i>
<i>Slam had a family of his own.</i>

01:41:41.100 --> 01:41:44.979
<i>Three, two, one, happy New Year!</i>

01:41:45.260 --> 01:41:49.492
<i>And Santa Claus finally got</i>
<i>the one present he always wanted.</i>

01:41:49.660 --> 01:41:50.695
<i>He got his brother back.</i>

01:41:50.860 --> 01:41:53.897
I'm not letting go. I got you in
a death grip. I'm not letting go.

01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:57.451
Look! Slimming down. Citrus fruits.

01:41:57.620 --> 01:41:58.735
Get out there, big guy.

01:41:58.900 --> 01:42:00.299
Bit more fancy, you know.

01:42:00.460 --> 01:42:02.849
Wanda, excuse me.
Mind if I take her away for a second?

01:42:03.020 --> 01:42:05.739
Oh, yeah, go right ahead.

01:42:05.900 --> 01:42:07.970
Come here, Dad.
It's just you and me now.

01:42:08.260 --> 01:42:09.978
<i>But as I told you before...</i>

01:42:10.140 --> 01:42:13.337
<i>... this is the story of a boy named Fred.</i>

01:42:13.540 --> 01:42:16.612
I just love Wanda. I mean,
she's a little bit above your station.

01:42:16.820 --> 01:42:19.971
So I thought maybe you should just
sort of clean up your act, you know?

01:42:20.140 --> 01:42:23.496
Have a great new wardrobe to start off
the new year. You're a Claus.

01:42:23.700 --> 01:42:26.294
Get out there. You know,
look at your dad. He's so dapper.

01:42:26.460 --> 01:42:28.496
Don't do it to me.
I'm trying to be positive.

01:42:28.660 --> 01:42:33.017
Oh, but I'm positive too. I'm positive
I'm right. You need a new wardrobe.

01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:34.249
Okay.

01:42:34.540 --> 01:42:36.531
- Happy New Year to you, Mom.
- Happy New Year.

01:42:36.700 --> 01:42:39.294
- I love you.
- I love you too.

01:42:39.860 --> 01:42:41.532
That's more like it.

01:42:41.700 --> 01:42:43.007
How about
that move?
