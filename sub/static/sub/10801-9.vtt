00:02.020 --> 00:05.603
Captain's log, stardate 45349.1.

00:05.732 --> 00:08.306
The Enterprise
is on its way to Penthara IV.

00:08.443 --> 00:12.108
A type-C asteroid has struck
an unpopulated continent.

00:12.239 --> 00:15.442
The resulting dust cloud
could create a phenomenon

00:15.575 --> 00:18.695
like the nuclear winters
of 21 st-century Earth.

00:18.829 --> 00:20.656
Cmdr La Forge has begun work

00:20.789 --> 00:24.075
on a plan that would counteract
the devastation.

00:25.502 --> 00:28.953
I'm afraid the numbers
indicate climatic changes.

00:29.089 --> 00:30.714
What drop can we expect?

00:30.841 --> 00:35.550
The Pentharans predict ten to 12
degrees Celsius within ten days.

00:35.679 --> 00:38.680
Their ecosystem will be shot to hell.

00:38.807 --> 00:41.594
I doubt they're prepared to cope
with the cold.

00:41.727 --> 00:43.387
- Cmdr Riker.
- Yes, sir?

00:43.520 --> 00:46.272
- Join me on the bridge, please.
- Right away.

00:46.398 --> 00:47.429
Are you certain?

00:47.566 --> 00:50.733
There was a space-time distortion.
Something is there.

00:50.861 --> 00:54.906
- We passed within 300 kilometres.
- Too close to be a coincidence.

00:55.032 --> 00:58.864
Mr La Forge, would a delay
of one hour affect your plans?

00:58.994 --> 01:02.577
Not unless another asteroid
hits Penthara, sir.

01:02.706 --> 01:06.075
The odds of that occurring
are extremely unlikely.

01:06.210 --> 01:07.455
Thank you, Mr Data.

01:07.586 --> 01:10.706
Let's look at Mr Worf's distortion.

01:10.840 --> 01:13.247
- Aye, sir.
- Mr Worf's what?

01:13.384 --> 01:17.797
Sensors detected a temporal
distortion almost in our course.

01:17.930 --> 01:20.717
There's a small object
that wasn't there before.

01:20.850 --> 01:23.056
It's 50 kilometres ahead, sir.

01:23.185 --> 01:25.012
- Full stop.
- Aye, sir.

01:25.146 --> 01:26.225
On screen.

01:28.774 --> 01:30.185
Dimensions, Worf?

01:30.318 --> 01:32.939
Approximately five metres long, sir.

01:33.070 --> 01:34.613
Life signs?

01:36.032 --> 01:40.160
No signs of any kind. Our sensors
do not penetrate the hull.

01:40.286 --> 01:41.614
Try hailing it.

01:43.206 --> 01:46.076
- That's odd.
- What's odd?

01:46.209 --> 01:48.830
We've received a response, but...

01:50.922 --> 01:52.546
Yes, Mr Worf?

01:52.674 --> 01:55.165
They want you to move over, sir.

01:57.762 --> 02:01.131
Reply that the Enterprise
isn't going anywhere.

02:01.266 --> 02:04.101
Not the Enterprise, Captain. You.

02:05.436 --> 02:07.927
What are you trying to tell me?

02:09.190 --> 02:12.725
Excuse me, but you were standing
right where I needed to be.

02:12.861 --> 02:14.059
Who are you?

02:14.195 --> 02:20.281
Rasmussen's the name, sir.
Professor Berlinghoff Rasmussen.

02:20.410 --> 02:25.701
This is wonderful! Actually,
quite a bit larger than I thought.

02:25.832 --> 02:26.828
Really?

02:26.958 --> 02:31.454
Where I come from, every historian
knows the bridge of old 1701-D!

02:33.882 --> 02:36.088
Where exactly do you come from?

02:36.218 --> 02:37.048
Why, Earth.

02:37.177 --> 02:40.131
Late 26th-century Earth, to be exact.

02:40.263 --> 02:44.261
I've travelled back nearly
300 years just to find you.

02:46.000 --> 02:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:15.424 --> 03:18.757
Space, the final frontier.

03:20.345 --> 03:24.343
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

03:24.475 --> 03:28.804
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds...

03:29.980 --> 03:33.432
...to seek out new life
and new civilisations...

03:34.568 --> 03:38.233
...to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

04:38.633 --> 04:41.124
Exactly what kind of historian
are you?

04:44.389 --> 04:47.924
My focus is on the 22nd
through the 24th centuries.

04:48.059 --> 04:50.348
Early interstellar history.

04:50.812 --> 04:55.390
It was always believed
this was on your desk, not here.

04:55.525 --> 04:57.185
Fascinating!

04:57.318 --> 04:59.228
Don't move it on my account!

04:59.362 --> 05:02.897
You can't expect me to believe
that the layout of my ready room

05:03.033 --> 05:05.737
can be of interest
to future historians.

05:05.869 --> 05:09.913
No less so than
your legendary modesty, Captain.

05:10.040 --> 05:14.867
If I could describe to you
what a thrill it is to be here!

05:15.003 --> 05:16.628
This is the original.

05:16.755 --> 05:18.629
You flatter me, Professor.

05:18.757 --> 05:20.915
But I can't help but wonder

05:21.051 --> 05:26.176
what could possibly have caused you
to select me as a subject for study.

05:26.306 --> 05:32.676
Even in this decade, there are far
wiser humans in and out of Starfleet.

05:32.813 --> 05:35.101
I'd love to tell you, I would.

05:35.232 --> 05:39.479
But imagine what a young Caesar
might have done differently

05:39.611 --> 05:42.185
had someone given him
a hint of what lay ahead,

05:42.322 --> 05:46.949
or if Lincoln had been coerced
into changing his theatre plans!

05:47.077 --> 05:51.075
I wish I could be more specific
on why you were selected,

05:51.206 --> 05:55.915
but I'm afraid the exchange
of information will have to flow

05:56.044 --> 05:58.167
in one direction only.

05:58.297 --> 06:01.880
Five, six, seven metres.

06:03.719 --> 06:05.712
I was right.

06:05.846 --> 06:07.257
- Why now?
- Right.

06:07.389 --> 06:10.972
If you've come to study us
and the Captain, why today?

06:11.101 --> 06:13.308
Why not a year ago
or a year from now?

06:13.437 --> 06:16.888
I picked the right day.
Just wait. You'll see.

06:18.108 --> 06:22.438
Do you always sit there,
on that side of the table?

06:22.571 --> 06:24.611
Usually. Why?

06:24.740 --> 06:27.362
It's not important.

06:27.493 --> 06:32.404
At what point does time travel
become a tool for historians?

06:32.540 --> 06:36.075
Now, now, Commander,
you know better than that.

06:36.210 --> 06:39.377
I've studied a great deal
about your century.

06:39.505 --> 06:43.004
You are all aware of the dangers
of altering the past.

06:43.134 --> 06:47.677
That's what I'd be doing if it were
to divulge information like that.

06:47.805 --> 06:50.557
- Telurian plague.
- I beg your pardon?

06:51.767 --> 06:54.472
The Telurian plague, was it cured?

06:54.604 --> 06:57.391
Did they find the cure
by your century?

06:57.523 --> 06:59.018
Surely I can ask that.

06:59.150 --> 07:04.571
It's difficult, but we must keep to
ourselves questions about the future.

07:04.697 --> 07:06.026
Go on, Professor.

07:06.157 --> 07:09.858
I'll prepare questionnaires.
Complete them when you can.

07:09.994 --> 07:13.612
If you're concerned
about a breach of security,

07:13.748 --> 07:16.951
I'm sure your captain
can make a determination.

07:17.085 --> 07:21.581
And thank you in advance
for curbing your curiosity.

07:21.714 --> 07:25.712
If I hand it in on time, can I get
a glimpse of next week's poker game?

07:29.389 --> 07:32.425
Mr Data, escort the Professor
to his quarters.

07:32.559 --> 07:34.267
This way, sir.

07:40.775 --> 07:43.313
What did he mean,
he picked the right day?

07:43.445 --> 07:46.695
- You know everything I do.
- Deanna?

07:46.823 --> 07:50.358
It's hard to tell,
but he is holding something back.

07:50.494 --> 07:54.574
Of course he is.
All the things he could tell us.

07:55.415 --> 07:57.989
It might be that. I don't know.

07:59.211 --> 08:03.837
What if he's an impostor?
We've seen enough of them.

08:03.965 --> 08:06.670
He is human.
Medical scans prove that.

08:06.802 --> 08:08.462
He's human, alright.

08:08.595 --> 08:11.051
There was a temporal distortion,
Mr Worf?

08:11.181 --> 08:12.426
Yes, sir.

08:12.557 --> 08:16.425
No one can deny that his ship
is unlike anything we've ever seen.

08:16.562 --> 08:20.096
The hull is made
of a plasticised tritanium mesh.

08:20.232 --> 08:22.557
We've nothing like it on record.

08:24.153 --> 08:27.937
Mr Worf,
I do appreciate your caution.

08:28.073 --> 08:29.817
I share it.

08:31.285 --> 08:34.784
Bring his vessel into the shuttlebay.
Place it under guard.

08:34.913 --> 08:35.909
Yes, sir.

08:37.082 --> 08:42.788
I realise that this visit is going
to be difficult for some of us,

08:42.922 --> 08:45.876
but his credentials
seem to be in order,

08:46.008 --> 08:49.092
so we should extend to him
every courtesy.

08:49.220 --> 08:51.378
Including questionnaires?

08:51.514 --> 08:54.005
Including questionnaires, Mr Worf.

08:59.897 --> 09:01.605
This is really a thrill,

09:01.732 --> 09:05.730
like running across a Redstone
missile or a Gutenberg Bible.

09:05.861 --> 09:08.732
To think, the Model T of androids.

09:10.324 --> 09:13.409
If you mean the first
production-model automobile

09:13.536 --> 09:17.616
of the 20th century, the Model A
would be a more apt analogy,

09:17.748 --> 09:20.702
since I am Dr Soong's
revised prototype.

09:20.835 --> 09:22.662
I stand corrected.

09:42.357 --> 09:44.148
Is there a problem?

09:44.776 --> 09:47.896
I suppose it'll have to do, for now.

09:48.029 --> 09:51.896
I'll get you a list of the things
I'll be needing, OK?

10:03.378 --> 10:05.620
Would I be correct in assuming

10:05.755 --> 10:10.963
that you know whether or not
I am still alive in the 26th century?

10:26.568 --> 10:30.696
Since you seem to know so much
about the ship, I assumed...

10:30.822 --> 10:36.446
It'd be best if you kept your
assumptions to yourself, wouldn't it?

10:36.578 --> 10:39.828
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

10:55.013 --> 10:58.596
Captain's log, stardate 45350.3.

10:58.725 --> 11:02.308
We have arrived at Penthara IV
and can see for ourselves

11:02.438 --> 11:06.649
the atmospheric devastation
caused by the asteroid's impact.

11:16.285 --> 11:19.618
We've located underground pockets
of carbon dioxide

11:19.747 --> 11:22.072
here, here and here.

11:22.208 --> 11:25.623
Our drilling phasers
can release enough of the gas

11:25.753 --> 11:30.664
to form an envelope to temporarily
hold in the heat of the sun.

11:30.800 --> 11:33.966
We've spent years
trying to avoid anything

11:34.095 --> 11:36.632
that would lead
to a greenhouse effect,

11:36.764 --> 11:40.049
and now we're about
to create one on purpose!

11:40.184 --> 11:44.051
Less than 20 percent of
normal sunlight is getting through.

11:44.188 --> 11:48.815
If we can hold enough heat in, that
should give the planet time to mend.

11:48.943 --> 11:51.778
- Excuse me, Dr Moseley?
- What now?

11:51.904 --> 11:55.320
New Seattle reports a cloud depth
of 12 kilometres.

11:55.449 --> 11:58.320
Two tropical rivers are freezing.

11:58.828 --> 12:02.327
Let's start,
before there's nothing left to mend.

12:10.381 --> 12:12.041
Look who's here.

12:13.509 --> 12:15.668
I hate questionnaires.

12:15.803 --> 12:19.007
Professor! Come and join us.

12:28.942 --> 12:30.602
Hope I'm not intruding.

12:30.735 --> 12:35.112
Not at all. You're the topic
of conversation at every table here.

12:35.240 --> 12:38.194
As I promised,
here are your assignments.

12:38.326 --> 12:40.070
I'm sure they're painless.

12:40.203 --> 12:44.035
Please try and complete them
by tomorrow.

12:44.165 --> 12:47.949
- Tomorrow?
- No problem, Professor.

12:48.837 --> 12:53.000
- You're all very calm.
- Any reason we shouldn't be?

12:53.133 --> 12:56.336
History always records
what people were doing

12:56.469 --> 12:58.758
when important events took place.

12:58.889 --> 13:02.258
But it rarely remembers
their activities

13:02.392 --> 13:05.144
a week before, a day or even an hour.

13:05.270 --> 13:08.390
Are you suggesting
an important event is imminent?

13:08.523 --> 13:10.148
I didn't say that.

13:10.275 --> 13:13.976
Go on doing what you're doing
and pretend I'm not here.

13:15.781 --> 13:18.450
Why is there no record
of other historians

13:18.575 --> 13:21.197
travelling back to witness events?

13:21.328 --> 13:23.367
We're obviously very careful.

13:23.497 --> 13:28.657
In fact, a colleague and I recently
paid a call on a 22nd-century vessel.

13:28.794 --> 13:34.001
They hadn't perfected quarantine
fields. You saw surgical masks?

13:34.133 --> 13:38.047
Isn't it fascinating
how everyone has different interests

13:38.178 --> 13:42.721
when it comes to history?
Different perspectives on progress.

13:43.559 --> 13:48.221
- Would you tell me what that is?
- Just checking the time.

13:48.355 --> 13:51.475
Is something important
supposed to be happening?

13:51.609 --> 13:55.653
No, it's nothing. What about you?
What do you see

13:55.779 --> 14:00.323
as the most important example
of progress in the last 200 years?

14:02.453 --> 14:05.952
I suppose the warp coil.
Before there was warp drive,

14:06.081 --> 14:08.952
humans were confined
to one sector of the galaxy.

14:09.085 --> 14:12.454
Spoken like the consummate explorer!

14:14.673 --> 14:17.877
What is going on?
Are you expecting someone?

14:18.010 --> 14:20.548
- Phasers.
- I beg your pardon?

14:20.680 --> 14:23.052
There were no phasers
in the 22nd century.

14:23.182 --> 14:28.687
See? Our Klingon friend is a perfect
example of what I was telling you.

14:28.813 --> 14:32.597
He views history through the eyes
of a hunter. A warrior.

14:32.733 --> 14:37.230
His passion lies in the perfection
of the tools of violence.

14:37.363 --> 14:40.115
How delightfully primitive!

14:44.162 --> 14:45.786
When we input this data,

14:45.913 --> 14:49.247
the computer should tell us
how many holes to punch.

14:49.375 --> 14:52.827
- How is tectonic stability?
- Couldn't be better.

14:52.962 --> 14:57.209
Scans were all clear. There
hasn't been a quiver in a century.

14:57.342 --> 15:01.042
Just the two I'm looking for.
I brought you the forms.

15:01.179 --> 15:03.670
Shouldn't take more than a few hours.

15:03.806 --> 15:06.262
We're busy.
Tomorrow would be better.

15:06.392 --> 15:09.310
Data, we've got
23,000 thermal simulations.

15:09.437 --> 15:12.522
- Could you check for anomalies?
- Certainly.

15:29.124 --> 15:31.449
Is that as fast as he can go?

15:33.253 --> 15:35.210
Not fast enough for you?

15:35.338 --> 15:38.174
There's little known
about Data's efficiency.

15:38.300 --> 15:41.217
Almost nothing
about his part in this mission.

15:41.344 --> 15:44.963
It's a topic of great conjecture.

15:45.098 --> 15:48.301
209 anomalies,
all within acceptable parameters.

15:48.435 --> 15:50.262
Thanks, Data.

15:52.939 --> 15:56.522
You're here to witness this mission.
That's it, isn't it?

15:57.486 --> 16:00.652
It'd be best if you
thought of me as a fly on the wall

16:00.781 --> 16:02.572
and went about your business.

16:02.699 --> 16:05.617
I will have
your answered questions soon.

16:05.744 --> 16:09.956
Data at Penthara IV!

16:10.082 --> 16:11.410
If you'll excuse me.

16:11.542 --> 16:14.293
Your prosthesis,
what do you call it again?

16:14.420 --> 16:17.337
- A visor.
- Visor. Right. A visor.

16:17.464 --> 16:21.332
I have a picture of you wearing that.
How do you like it?

16:21.468 --> 16:23.876
It allows me to see.
I like it just fine.

16:24.013 --> 16:26.219
You know, Homer was blind.

16:26.348 --> 16:31.343
Milton, Bach, Monet, Wonder.

16:32.730 --> 16:36.063
- A fly on the wall, huh?
- Fly on the wall.

16:36.192 --> 16:39.976
The computer has configured
the drilling patterns.

16:40.112 --> 16:43.113
Captain,
I'm ready to transport down.

16:43.240 --> 16:47.190
l'll notify Dr Moseley.
Good luck, Geordi.

16:47.328 --> 16:48.703
Gentlemen.

16:55.127 --> 16:59.706
Who said these moments are less
exciting when you know the outcome?

17:01.968 --> 17:04.090
I know of no one who said that.

17:12.770 --> 17:17.017
Enterprise will monitor the CO2
concentrations at six altitudes.

17:17.150 --> 17:20.233
If all goes well, it should take
only 20 bore sites.

17:20.361 --> 17:22.318
Let's hope all goes well.

17:23.156 --> 17:25.777
La Forge to Cmdr Riker.
How are you doing?

17:25.907 --> 17:30.535
The monitoring stations are on line.
We're ready when you are.

17:30.663 --> 17:34.281
Excellent. All we need now
is an open channel to Data.

17:35.084 --> 17:38.038
Open a channel, Mr Worf,
and prepare to fire.

17:38.171 --> 17:42.334
The computer has locked in
the phaser-depth calculations.

17:42.467 --> 17:44.210
- Mr Data?
- Ready, sir.

17:44.344 --> 17:45.506
Fire.

17:58.900 --> 18:02.483
Target one is emitting
2,000 cubic metres per second.

18:02.612 --> 18:04.854
Target two, 1,600.

18:04.990 --> 18:08.323
Surface wind patterns are stable.

18:08.451 --> 18:10.491
Anything at altitude, Data?

18:10.912 --> 18:15.539
CO2 concentrations remain
unchanged at upper elevations.

18:28.055 --> 18:30.427
Have I missed much?

18:30.557 --> 18:33.095
Target 14 complete, sir.

18:34.895 --> 18:35.891
Data?

18:36.021 --> 18:38.892
- What have you got?
- No change, sir.

18:41.652 --> 18:44.107
How are the surface winds, Geordi?

18:44.238 --> 18:45.780
Holding steady, sir.

18:46.406 --> 18:48.814
The computer has stopped drilling.

18:48.951 --> 18:51.786
You should be getting something now,
Data.

18:53.497 --> 18:56.284
Elevated CO2 levels
at 20 kilometres, sir.

18:56.417 --> 18:59.536
Now you're talking.
We've got new temperatures.

18:59.670 --> 19:03.039
All stations report
no further temperature drops.

19:03.173 --> 19:07.467
Correction, two equatorial stations
report slight increases.

19:07.595 --> 19:11.639
Thank you, all.
You've given us what we need. Time.

19:12.600 --> 19:14.473
We're glad to be of help.

19:14.602 --> 19:18.979
We will continue to monitor
your progress. Picard out.

19:19.106 --> 19:23.400
"You've given us what we need.
Time."

19:25.446 --> 19:28.566
- Return to synchronous orbit.
- Aye, sir.

19:29.325 --> 19:32.528
Very clever, Picard. Well done!

19:32.662 --> 19:36.494
We always knew how you did it,
but to experience the moment,

19:36.624 --> 19:41.784
to witness the nuances,
it's indescribable.

19:51.222 --> 19:53.843
He's after
more than a history lesson.

19:53.975 --> 19:56.929
- What are you getting from him?
- I don't know.

19:57.061 --> 20:00.810
It's like he's trying to confuse us,
misdirect us somehow.

20:00.940 --> 20:02.269
There you are!

20:02.775 --> 20:05.895
Well, that certainly was exciting,
wasn't it?

20:06.029 --> 20:08.401
Is everything alright? Are you well?

20:08.531 --> 20:10.073
Yes. Couldn't be better.

20:10.200 --> 20:13.734
I thought we might chat
about your questionnaire.

20:13.870 --> 20:17.203
Buck up, Crewman!
You're a credit to that uniform!

20:17.332 --> 20:18.743
I've got things to do.

20:18.875 --> 20:22.244
No, please, Counsellor.
I'd appreciate your remaining.

20:22.378 --> 20:27.455
Doctor, in response to question six,
you spoke of a neural stimulator.

20:27.592 --> 20:28.755
May I see one?

20:28.885 --> 20:31.458
I don't see why not.
Give me a minute.

20:37.852 --> 20:42.146
- You don't like me very much.
- I don't dislike you, Professor.

20:43.400 --> 20:45.439
Keep your eyes wide, soldier.

20:45.569 --> 20:49.518
You'll tell your grandchildren
you were at Penthara IV.

20:55.829 --> 20:57.822
But you don't trust me.

20:57.956 --> 20:59.664
- You should.
- Should I?

20:59.791 --> 21:02.876
"Picard's empath won't trust you,"
they said.

21:03.003 --> 21:07.795
- Picard's empath?
- We're not that unalike, you and I.

21:07.925 --> 21:10.879
You possess a sense
that is foreign to the others.

21:11.011 --> 21:13.502
My knowledge of the future
is similar.

21:13.639 --> 21:16.889
Some of my best friends are empaths.
They trust me.

21:17.017 --> 21:19.852
Why should you care
if I trust you or not?

21:19.978 --> 21:23.846
We're birds of a feather.
We're colleagues.

21:23.982 --> 21:26.390
We could learn a lot from each other.

21:27.194 --> 21:30.361
You're right. I don't trust you.

21:31.490 --> 21:35.108
- I knew you'd say that.
- I'm sure you did.

21:35.244 --> 21:38.862
Well, I'm glad you two
are finally getting along.

21:38.998 --> 21:40.871
I really have to be going.

21:43.669 --> 21:45.163
Thank you.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.631
Why not try a berylite scan?

21:49.758 --> 21:53.377
I'd be interested
to see what his micro-levels are.

21:55.931 --> 21:57.723
So, what else can I show you?

22:00.519 --> 22:02.726
You're a very curious woman.

22:03.731 --> 22:06.269
No, I don't mean curious like that.

22:06.400 --> 22:09.650
I mean, you're curious about things,

22:09.779 --> 22:15.153
about berylite levels,
about the future.

22:15.618 --> 22:19.532
Well, curiosity is why all of us
are out here, isn't it?

22:19.664 --> 22:24.824
I understand. But you're different,
you're more vibrant.

22:24.961 --> 22:27.712
- More...
- More vibrant.

22:28.589 --> 22:30.381
That's nice. I like that.

22:30.508 --> 22:32.133
Whenever I travel back,

22:32.260 --> 22:35.510
I meet very interesting people,
men and women.

22:35.638 --> 22:42.804
But I've never met anyone who gave
me thoughts about not going home.

22:45.607 --> 22:50.565
You're not supposed to be
influencing the past, remember?

22:52.155 --> 22:58.489
And I am beginning to feel
just a little bit influenced.

22:59.454 --> 23:06.287
Anyway, I could be your
great-great-great-great-grandmother.

23:22.435 --> 23:24.642
What kind of questions did he ask?

23:24.771 --> 23:27.227
He only asked about previous
starships,

23:27.357 --> 23:30.441
what was innovative
about the last Enterprise.

23:30.569 --> 23:34.020
He wanted to see if we had
a grasp of the fundamentals.

23:34.156 --> 23:36.860
His questions to me
were on Dr Soong's...

23:38.827 --> 23:43.952
I am detecting a massive earthquake.
Two earthquakes.

23:44.082 --> 23:45.197
Location?

23:45.334 --> 23:48.288
Both are beneath
the southern drill sites.

23:48.420 --> 23:49.618
Is La Forge there?

23:49.755 --> 23:51.166
- Yes, sir.
- Find him.

23:53.675 --> 23:56.427
We've got volcanic activity.
Pretty severe.

23:56.553 --> 23:58.297
Magnify.

24:01.058 --> 24:04.842
La Forge here. Moseley and I
are on our way to his lab.

24:04.978 --> 24:06.177
Are you alright?

24:06.313 --> 24:08.983
We're OK, but those were pretty big.

24:09.108 --> 24:12.773
If this was Earth,
l'd say 8.5 on the Richter scale.

24:12.903 --> 24:16.272
We're starting to see
some volcanic plumes.

24:18.784 --> 24:20.195
Two more eruptions.

24:20.327 --> 24:25.239
We probably overestimated geologic
stability around the CO2 pockets.

24:25.374 --> 24:27.995
- We're in the lab, sir.
- On screen.

24:28.836 --> 24:34.210
We're fairly quake-proof. It's the
volcanic dust l'm worried about.

24:36.218 --> 24:37.926
What about the dust?

24:38.054 --> 24:43.296
The ash from the volcanoes
will compound the existing problem.

24:43.434 --> 24:46.055
Soon, no sunlight will get through.

24:46.187 --> 24:49.223
No amount of CO2 will help us then.

24:49.357 --> 24:51.515
Captain, take a look at this.

24:57.824 --> 25:00.362
These are the coordinates
of the eruptions.

25:00.493 --> 25:06.080
And these are the coordinates
of the phaser-drilling sites.

25:06.207 --> 25:10.703
The mantle is collapsing
where the pressure was released.

25:10.837 --> 25:12.829
We have some ideas,

25:12.964 --> 25:15.419
but it will take time
to sort them out.

25:15.550 --> 25:18.467
- Sort them out, Geordi.
- Aye, sir.

25:22.307 --> 25:25.557
We came here to help these people.

25:25.685 --> 25:27.642
And look what we've done.

25:46.373 --> 25:48.412
What in God's name is that?

25:48.541 --> 25:50.534
- Music, Professor.
- Music?

25:50.669 --> 25:53.788
Yes, sir. Mozart's Jupiter Symphony
in C major,

25:53.922 --> 25:56.330
Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No.3,

25:56.466 --> 26:00.464
Beethoven's 9th Symphony,
second movement, molto vivace,

26:00.595 --> 26:04.047
and La donna e mobile
from Verdi's Rigoletto.

26:04.182 --> 26:05.974
Could you thin it out a bit?

26:07.227 --> 26:09.599
Computer, eliminate program one.

26:13.442 --> 26:16.277
Computer, eliminate program two.

26:20.699 --> 26:23.985
Computer, eliminate program three.

26:26.038 --> 26:28.445
Computer, half-volume.

26:29.082 --> 26:31.122
How the...?

26:31.251 --> 26:35.000
How can you listen to four pieces
of music at the same time?

26:35.130 --> 26:39.591
I can distinguish
over 150 simultaneous compositions.

26:39.718 --> 26:45.057
In order to analyse the aesthetics,
I try to keep it to ten or less.

26:45.182 --> 26:46.842
Only four today?

26:46.976 --> 26:50.808
I am assisting Cmdr La Forge
with a complex calculation.

26:50.938 --> 26:53.690
It demands
a great deal of concentration.

26:53.816 --> 26:57.019
I came to thank you
for answering my questions.

26:57.153 --> 27:00.901
I should have asked you
to limit yourself to 50,000 words.

27:01.615 --> 27:03.904
You did ask me to be thorough.

27:04.785 --> 27:06.778
I know it's hard to believe,

27:06.912 --> 27:11.658
but few records of Dr Soong's work
survived to the 26th century.

27:11.792 --> 27:16.335
So it would be invaluable to myself,
and other historians,

27:16.464 --> 27:19.880
if you could provide us
with some schematics.

27:20.009 --> 27:22.963
Certainly. Once my work here
is completed.

27:23.095 --> 27:27.045
As long as it's before 0900 tomorrow.
That's when I head back.

27:27.183 --> 27:29.508
- Bridge to Data.
- Yes, Worf?

27:29.644 --> 27:32.598
Cmdr La Forge is hailing you
from the surface.

27:32.730 --> 27:34.889
Patch him through, please.

27:35.024 --> 27:37.811
Have you rerun
the phase-reversal figures?

27:37.944 --> 27:39.568
There were no errors.

27:39.696 --> 27:43.693
The variance must be
no more than.06 terawatts.

27:43.825 --> 27:47.407
I see no other choice.
We'll continue to run the numbers

27:47.537 --> 27:50.242
but I doubt
we'll find anything different.

27:50.373 --> 27:53.409
Tell the Captain
the good news and the bad news.

27:53.543 --> 27:55.452
La Forge out.

27:55.587 --> 27:58.956
Which do you suppose
he's gonna want to hear first?

28:01.009 --> 28:03.926
- The good news.
- The motion of the dust

28:04.053 --> 28:08.134
has created electrostatic energy
in the upper atmosphere.

28:08.266 --> 28:10.057
With a modified phaser blast,

28:10.185 --> 28:14.265
we can create a shock front
to ionise the particles.

28:14.397 --> 28:17.564
That would be like a spark
in a gas-filled room.

28:17.692 --> 28:19.021
With one exception.

28:19.152 --> 28:22.521
The particles would
turn into high-energy plasma

28:22.656 --> 28:26.440
which our shields could absorb
and redirect into space.

28:26.576 --> 28:28.818
Turn the ship into a lightning rod?

28:28.954 --> 28:31.279
- Precisely, sir.
- The bad news?

28:31.414 --> 28:35.282
If our phaser discharge
is off by just.06 terawatts,

28:35.418 --> 28:38.455
it would cause
a cascading exothermal inversion.

28:39.005 --> 28:40.085
Meaning?

28:40.215 --> 28:43.251
We would completely burn off
the atmosphere.

28:51.393 --> 28:53.267
Captain's log, supplemental.

28:53.395 --> 28:56.729
While Dr Moseley
takes La Forge's plan to the colony,

28:56.857 --> 29:02.148
I am weighing the consequences
of a more philosophical issue.

29:03.363 --> 29:04.395
Come.

29:09.244 --> 29:11.570
You know why I've asked you here.

29:11.705 --> 29:14.540
Yeah, I have a fairly good idea.

29:14.666 --> 29:20.253
I'm faced with a dilemma. A planet
beneath us is slowly turning to ice.

29:20.381 --> 29:24.081
Unless we do something about it,
in a matter of weeks,

29:24.218 --> 29:27.669
thousands,
maybe tens of thousands, will die.

29:28.597 --> 29:29.973
That'd be a shame.

29:30.099 --> 29:33.468
Yes, it would.
It would be quite a shame.

29:34.270 --> 29:37.935
So, what's your dilemma?

29:38.065 --> 29:40.687
Cmdr La Forge
has a possible solution.

29:40.818 --> 29:44.104
The margins of error
are extremely critical,

29:44.238 --> 29:47.358
but if successful,
there'll be no more threat.

29:47.491 --> 29:49.365
And if it's not successful?

29:49.493 --> 29:52.067
Every living thing will perish.

29:52.747 --> 29:56.080
So, do nothing,
and thousands will die.

29:56.208 --> 30:00.289
Do something and millions could die.
That's a tough choice.

30:01.506 --> 30:03.332
Not if you were to help me.

30:03.925 --> 30:06.879
You're not suggesting
I tell you the outcome?

30:07.011 --> 30:09.467
Oh, no. I am not.

30:10.431 --> 30:15.592
Everything I have ever believed in
tells me I cannot ask you that.

30:15.728 --> 30:21.019
But, at the same time, there are
20 million lives down there.

30:22.652 --> 30:27.195
And you know what happened to them.
What will happen to them.

30:27.323 --> 30:29.731
So,
it seems you have another dilemma.

30:29.868 --> 30:32.655
One that questions your convictions.

30:32.787 --> 30:36.571
I've never been afraid
of re-evaluating my convictions.

30:36.708 --> 30:40.207
Now, I have 20 million reasons
to do so.

30:41.212 --> 30:43.703
And why did you ask to see me?

30:43.840 --> 30:47.291
Because your presence
gives me a potential access

30:47.427 --> 30:51.425
to a kind of information
that I've never had before.

30:51.556 --> 30:54.972
And if I am
to re-examine my beliefs,

30:55.101 --> 30:58.850
then I must take advantage
of every possible asset.

30:58.980 --> 31:02.100
It would be irresponsible
not to ask you here.

31:02.234 --> 31:04.938
However you come to terms
with your beliefs,

31:05.070 --> 31:07.146
I'm quite comfortable with mine.

31:08.031 --> 31:12.693
How can you be? How can you be
comfortable watching people die?

31:14.371 --> 31:17.407
Let me put it to you this way.

31:17.541 --> 31:20.458
If I were to tell you
that none of them died,

31:20.585 --> 31:24.417
you'd conclude
that you tried and succeeded.

31:24.548 --> 31:28.248
So you'd confidently try again.
No harm in that.

31:28.385 --> 31:31.505
But what if I were to tell you
they all died?

31:31.638 --> 31:35.339
You'd decide not to make
the same mistake twice.

31:35.475 --> 31:37.515
What if one of the people grew up...

31:37.644 --> 31:41.476
I know! What if one of those lives
I saved as a child

31:41.607 --> 31:45.225
grows up to be the next Adolf Hitler
or Khan Singh?

31:45.360 --> 31:48.148
Every philosophy student
has been asked that

31:48.280 --> 31:50.486
since wormholes were discovered.

31:50.616 --> 31:53.107
But this is not a class
in temporal logic!

31:53.243 --> 31:56.161
It's not theoretical or hypothetical.
It's real!

31:56.288 --> 31:58.910
- Surely you see that?
- All too well.

31:59.041 --> 32:02.291
But you must see
that if I were to influence you,

32:02.419 --> 32:06.500
everything in this sector,
in this quadrant, could change.

32:06.632 --> 32:12.717
History, my history, would unfold
in a way other than it already has.

32:12.847 --> 32:18.007
What possible incentive could anyone
offer me to allow that to happen?

32:18.144 --> 32:19.970
I have two choices.

32:20.104 --> 32:24.896
Either way, one version of history
or another will wend its way forward.

32:25.026 --> 32:28.726
The history you know or another.
Who is to say which is better?

32:28.863 --> 32:31.235
What I do know is that here, today,

32:31.365 --> 32:34.651
one way,
millions of lives could be saved.

32:34.785 --> 32:36.743
Isn't that incentive enough?

32:36.871 --> 32:41.034
Everyone dies, Captain.
It's just a question of when.

32:41.167 --> 32:44.452
All those people
died years before I was born.

32:44.587 --> 32:46.876
All of you up here as well.

32:47.006 --> 32:51.502
I can't get quite as worked up as you
over the fate of some colonists

32:51.636 --> 32:54.969
who, for me, have been dead
a very, very long time.

32:55.098 --> 32:57.386
You know of the Prime Directive,

32:57.517 --> 33:00.387
which tells us
we have no right to interfere

33:00.520 --> 33:03.687
in the natural evolution
of alien worlds.

33:03.815 --> 33:06.899
I have sworn to uphold it.

33:07.026 --> 33:12.780
But, nevertheless,
I have disregarded that directive,

33:12.907 --> 33:15.577
on more than one occasion,

33:15.702 --> 33:19.237
because I thought
it was the right thing to do!

33:19.372 --> 33:22.539
Now, if you are holding on

33:22.667 --> 33:26.167
to some temporal equivalent
of that directive,

33:26.296 --> 33:29.914
then isn't it possible
that you have an occasion here

33:30.050 --> 33:35.175
to make an exception,
to help me choose,

33:35.305 --> 33:37.630
because it's the right thing to do?

33:38.058 --> 33:42.186
It's not just a choice. You're
trying to manipulate the future.

33:42.312 --> 33:46.013
Every choice we make allows us
to manipulate the future.

33:46.149 --> 33:50.229
Do I invite Adrienne or Suzanne
to the spring dance?

33:50.362 --> 33:52.900
Do I holiday on Corsica or Risa?

33:53.573 --> 33:56.777
A person's life, their future,

33:56.910 --> 34:00.077
hinges on each
of a thousand choices.

34:00.205 --> 34:02.281
Living is making choices!

34:02.416 --> 34:05.203
You ask me to believe
that if I make a choice

34:05.335 --> 34:08.455
other than the one
in your history books,

34:08.589 --> 34:11.672
then your past
will be irrevocably altered.

34:11.800 --> 34:15.928
Well, you know, Professor, perhaps
I don't give a damn about your past

34:16.054 --> 34:17.928
because your past is my future

34:18.056 --> 34:21.556
and as far as I'm concerned,
it hasn't been written yet!

34:22.351 --> 34:26.896
The electrostatic conditions
are about as good as they'll get.

34:27.024 --> 34:30.025
If we're going to try this,
now's the time.

34:31.152 --> 34:33.561
Please don't ask me, Captain.

34:35.282 --> 34:37.322
I can't help you.

34:38.661 --> 34:40.321
I'm sorry.

34:48.003 --> 34:50.161
How long to program the phasers?

34:50.297 --> 34:53.168
We've just got to
tie in to Geordi's sensors.

34:53.300 --> 34:56.337
So you made your choice,
without my help.

34:56.469 --> 34:59.341
On the contrary,
you were quite helpful.

34:59.473 --> 35:00.636
How's that?

35:00.766 --> 35:04.681
By refusing to help, you left me
with the choice I had to begin with.

35:04.812 --> 35:09.604
To try or not to try,
to take a risk or to play it safe.

35:09.734 --> 35:14.645
Your arguments have reminded me
how precious the right to choose is.

35:16.240 --> 35:19.823
And because I've never been one
to play it safe...

35:21.037 --> 35:22.661
...I choose to try.

35:22.789 --> 35:26.952
- Program the firing sequence.
- Aye, sir.

35:34.217 --> 35:37.218
Captain's log, stardate 45351.9.

35:37.345 --> 35:40.216
Dr Moseley has met
with the colony leaders

35:40.348 --> 35:42.756
who are all willing to take the risk.

35:43.351 --> 35:46.969
Warp power has been rerouted
from the deflector dish.

35:47.105 --> 35:51.814
Keep the phasers on active surge
control. We get one shot at this.

35:51.943 --> 35:55.478
- Well, this is it!
- Is the sequence locked in?

35:55.613 --> 35:58.283
Yes, sir. After an 8.3- second burst,

35:58.408 --> 36:01.777
we will discharge all EPS taps
through the phasers.

36:01.911 --> 36:05.280
Time to return, Mr La Forge.
Mr O'Brien, stand by.

36:05.415 --> 36:07.538
I can be more help here.

36:07.667 --> 36:11.202
We'll have to compensate
for density variations.

36:11.338 --> 36:14.789
Dr Moseley's computers
can accomplish that task,

36:14.925 --> 36:18.839
but Geordi would be better able
to anticipate variances.

36:18.970 --> 36:23.300
You know there's no guarantee
this will work. If it fails...

36:23.433 --> 36:26.387
There's no guarantee it will fail,
Captain.

36:27.187 --> 36:29.512
l'd like your permission
to remain here.

36:32.693 --> 36:37.319
- Permission granted.
- La Forge remained below.

36:39.032 --> 36:41.358
- Good luck, Commander.
- Thank you.

36:44.913 --> 36:47.665
The deflector dish
has been reconfigured, sir.

36:47.791 --> 36:49.202
Proceed, Mr Data.

36:49.334 --> 36:52.170
Stand by for auto-phaser interlock.

36:52.296 --> 36:55.250
Activating deflector beam.

37:03.974 --> 37:07.308
EPS taps on line. Phasers firing.

37:41.554 --> 37:44.887
Activating shield inverters now.

38:05.787 --> 38:07.197
Mr La Forge?

38:09.832 --> 38:13.332
La Forge here.
Still breathing, Captain.

38:13.461 --> 38:17.589
We've got particulate levels
right where they should be

38:17.715 --> 38:19.423
and the sun is shining!

38:19.551 --> 38:23.500
See? I told you
there was nothing to worry about.

38:23.638 --> 38:26.129
Report back when you're ready.

38:26.266 --> 38:31.058
Doctor, we'll analyse
the remaining volcanic disturbances,

38:31.187 --> 38:36.063
but the best advice would be
to let them cool down on their own.

38:36.192 --> 38:40.356
l'm getting in the habit
of thanking you, Picard.

38:43.783 --> 38:47.199
Well, I'd love to see more,
but it's nearly time to go.

38:47.329 --> 38:52.240
I am tickled pink to have had
the opportunity of witnessing this.

38:52.375 --> 38:55.460
And you did it all without any help.

38:55.587 --> 38:59.336
Well, must run.
Got some packing to do.

39:01.134 --> 39:04.301
You know you're taller in person,
Commander.

39:23.824 --> 39:27.774
Look at this! Who would have
expected a teary farewell?

39:27.911 --> 39:30.237
We have to look inside your vessel.

39:30.372 --> 39:33.706
Curious till the end, Captain?

39:35.085 --> 39:38.371
You can't be serious.
We've been through this.

39:38.505 --> 39:41.043
Some objects have gone missing.

39:41.175 --> 39:45.089
If they're in your possession,
we would like them returned.

39:45.220 --> 39:49.847
I'm not here in search of relics!
I'm sure they'll turn up.

39:51.185 --> 39:54.435
If you will not open the vessel,
I will,

39:54.563 --> 39:57.315
with explosives if necessary.

39:57.441 --> 39:59.350
I doubt you have the means.

39:59.485 --> 40:02.605
If we don't get in there,
I guarantee you don't either.

40:05.741 --> 40:09.027
Considering the sensitive nature
of my equipment,

40:09.161 --> 40:13.788
you'll understand if I request that
only Mr Data be allowed to see it.

40:13.916 --> 40:15.161
Why Data?

40:15.293 --> 40:18.875
Because if I order Data never
to divulge what he sees, he won't,

40:19.005 --> 40:21.922
except anything
that might belong to us.

40:22.049 --> 40:23.674
Understood, sir.

40:28.389 --> 40:29.670
Back in a minute.

40:52.163 --> 40:55.248
None of these items belong to you.

40:56.000 --> 40:56.949
Nor does this.

40:57.085 --> 41:00.169
This phaser is set
at the highest stun setting.

41:00.296 --> 41:04.377
If I'm correct, that is sufficient
to immobilise even you.

41:04.509 --> 41:07.593
Why have you stolen these objects?
For a museum?

41:07.721 --> 41:10.176
Far too valuable for that.

41:10.306 --> 41:14.304
In the century I come from,
they haven't been invented.

41:14.436 --> 41:18.979
But this vessel, the temporal
distortion on your arrival.

41:19.107 --> 41:23.354
This is a timepod
and it is from the 26th century.

41:23.486 --> 41:26.737
At least,
that's what the poor fella said.

41:26.865 --> 41:30.732
He travelled back
to the 22nd century, that's my time,

41:30.869 --> 41:33.277
and had the misfortune to meet me.

41:33.413 --> 41:36.580
His clothes fit quite well.

41:36.708 --> 41:40.124
It took me weeks to figure out
how to work this thing.

41:40.253 --> 41:41.913
You are not an historian?

41:42.047 --> 41:46.508
More of an inventor. Until recently,
a dismally unsuccessful one.

41:47.302 --> 41:49.176
What are your intentions?

41:49.304 --> 41:53.634
Thanks to your captain, it seems
they have changed slightly.

41:53.767 --> 41:58.180
I was quite content
to return with these trinkets.

41:58.313 --> 42:00.983
I'd invent about one a year.

42:01.108 --> 42:04.808
But now, look what fortune
has graced me with!

42:04.945 --> 42:08.314
You will take longer to figure out
than a tricorder,

42:08.449 --> 42:10.690
but it should be well worth it.

42:11.618 --> 42:14.987
If the auto-timer is programmed
the way I think it is,

42:15.122 --> 42:16.700
in about two minutes,

42:16.832 --> 42:20.960
we should be on our way back
to a place called New Jersey.

42:21.503 --> 42:24.457
I'm afraid you won't be awake
for the ride.

42:29.386 --> 42:32.257
I assume your hand print
will open this door

42:32.389 --> 42:34.963
whether you are conscious or not.

42:38.604 --> 42:41.605
That weapon was working yesterday.

42:41.732 --> 42:43.891
You were right to suspect him.

42:44.026 --> 42:47.478
But he is not from the future.
He is from the past.

42:51.617 --> 42:56.908
Trying to make my history unfold
in a way other than it already has?

42:58.457 --> 43:01.743
This was all a misunderstanding.

43:01.878 --> 43:04.832
Let me back in.
We'll forget the whole thing.

43:04.964 --> 43:08.380
What possible incentive
could I have to allow that?

43:09.927 --> 43:13.213
You will find
all the missing items in the vessel.

43:14.057 --> 43:17.591
- Doctor.
- Very nice performance.

43:17.727 --> 43:20.562
Not all of it. Some of it was real.

43:22.649 --> 43:23.763
Captain.

43:23.900 --> 43:27.684
He claims to be
a 22nd-century inventor, Captain.

43:27.820 --> 43:31.320
If you were more inventive
and fewer things had disappeared,

43:31.449 --> 43:33.193
we wouldn't have suspected.

43:33.326 --> 43:37.371
The stumbling block was your ship.
Our sensors couldn't penetrate it.

43:37.497 --> 43:42.704
Once the door was open, the computer
was able to detect and deactivate

43:42.836 --> 43:46.039
everything you'd stolen,
including this.

43:46.172 --> 43:49.873
I'd love to hear more,
but I must get back in that pod.

43:50.010 --> 43:52.465
Take him to a detention cell,
Mr Worf.

43:52.596 --> 43:56.676
Notify Starfleet that we will
drop him off at Starbase 214.

43:56.808 --> 44:01.185
You can't do this. I've got to
get back. I don't belong here!

44:02.856 --> 44:04.315
No!

44:07.694 --> 44:12.570
I'm sure there are more than a few
legitimate historians at Starfleet

44:12.699 --> 44:15.736
who will be eager
to meet a human from your era.

44:18.330 --> 44:19.824
Professor?

44:21.750 --> 44:24.786
Welcome to the 24th century.
