12:31.318 --> 12:34.886
But I'm supposed to be
briefing Princess Twilight

12:34.888 --> 12:36.888
on the progress with
the water main.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.523
I speak for the Princess.

12:38.525 --> 12:41.059
Well, uh, can I start
fixing it again?

12:41.061 --> 12:43.461
I'm gettin' a little
worried, to be honest.

12:43.463 --> 12:46.364
Actually, Twilight still needs
her rest and her "no noise"

12:46.366 --> 12:50.068
policy is still in effect
for a few more hours. Sorry!

12:52.538 --> 12:54.873
Hey Spike, what's going on?

12:54.875 --> 12:58.143
Oh, you know, just settin'
em up and knockin' em down.

12:58.145 --> 13:02.814
Not only have I kept things
quiet so Twilight could sleep,

13:02.816 --> 13:04.816
I also took care of all her
afternoon meetings

13:04.818 --> 13:08.019
so she won't have to worry
about them when she wakes up.

13:08.021 --> 13:10.522
Are you sure she'd
want you doing that?

13:10.524 --> 13:13.258
There are so many things to
keep track of at this Summit.

13:13.260 --> 13:15.560
Ah, don't worry,
I got it covered.

13:15.562 --> 13:19.097
I know Twilight so well, it's
easy to make decisions like her.

13:19.099 --> 13:21.432
Oh. OK.

13:21.434 --> 13:25.270
Well, thank you for keeping
Twilight's stress level down...

13:25.272 --> 13:28.840
...as long as that's the
real reason you're doing it.

13:28.842 --> 13:31.476
Well, why else
would I be doing it?

13:31.478 --> 13:35.146
You're not enjoying speaking
for Twilight a little bit?

13:35.148 --> 13:37.849
Enjoying it? Ha ha! No way!

13:37.851 --> 13:40.051
The only things I'm doing
by order of the Princess

13:40.053 --> 13:41.586
are for the good of the Summit.

13:47.960 --> 13:50.361
Heh heh heh heh.

13:50.363 --> 13:52.030
[sigh]

13:52.032 --> 13:54.199
By order of the Princess.

13:59.271 --> 14:01.039
By order of the Princess.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.347
By order of the Princess.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.619
Ah. Princess life is good.

14:17.356 --> 14:21.860
It sure is. But it's also
hard work, isn't it?

14:21.862 --> 14:23.394
Eh, it's not so bad.

14:23.396 --> 14:26.497
Spike, I'm concerned you might
be abusing your relationship

14:26.499 --> 14:28.366
with Twilight.

14:28.368 --> 14:31.369
What are you talking about?
I'm a great princess!

14:31.371 --> 14:33.271
I mean, Twilight's
a great princess

14:33.273 --> 14:35.240
and I've been working
hard to help her!

14:35.242 --> 14:36.908
When two delegates
had a falling out,

14:36.910 --> 14:38.576
I'm the one who fixed
their friendship!

14:38.578 --> 14:40.578
I listened to that pony
drone on about gems

14:40.580 --> 14:42.914
for forty-five minutes so
Twilight wouldn't have to!

14:42.916 --> 14:45.617
I moved a polo match away from
the tower so she could sleep!

14:45.619 --> 14:48.219
And I didn't even eat that
delicious looking statue!

14:48.221 --> 14:50.054
I'm a decision-making master!

14:52.225 --> 14:57.562
OK, so maybe I did get a little
carried away making decisions.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.430
But it's not like
anything bad happened.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.467
[click]

15:05.337 --> 15:06.571
[crash]

15:06.573 --> 15:08.606
[whoosh]

15:08.608 --> 15:10.441
[smash]

15:10.443 --> 15:13.378
Whooooaa!

15:21.320 --> 15:23.388
This is unexpected.

15:23.390 --> 15:26.291
I'll go shut off the main;
you get rid of the water!

15:50.115 --> 15:52.951
[rattling]

15:52.953 --> 15:54.585
[whoosh]

15:59.992 --> 16:02.327
At least the statue's OK.

16:04.063 --> 16:05.229
[sniff sniff]

16:05.231 --> 16:07.365
Oh no.

16:07.367 --> 16:08.566
Oh no!

16:08.568 --> 16:12.170
Ah...Ah...HACHEW!

16:12.172 --> 16:13.438
[smash]

16:17.309 --> 16:18.977
Aw, bless me.

16:23.449 --> 16:24.682
Oh my!

16:28.053 --> 16:29.988
What is the meaning of this?

16:29.990 --> 16:34.092
Well, uh, ya see, there
was this polo game and--

16:34.094 --> 16:36.060
How could you let
a water main burst

16:36.062 --> 16:38.229
on Canterlot's most
important day?

16:38.231 --> 16:39.564
Hey, don't look at me.

16:39.566 --> 16:42.433
Princess Twilight said
to stop working on it.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.102
Well, what about these trees?

16:44.104 --> 16:47.105
I ordered them trimmed to
avoid just such a situation!

16:47.107 --> 16:49.440
Well, the princess
told me to stop, bub.

16:49.442 --> 16:52.310
Why would the Princess make
such horrible decisions?

16:52.312 --> 16:54.112
This all could have
been prevented!

16:54.114 --> 16:55.480
[angry shouts]

16:55.482 --> 16:57.281
Please! Everypony, listen!

16:57.283 --> 16:59.250
I'm so sorry all this happened!

16:59.252 --> 17:01.019
What are you apologizing for?

17:01.021 --> 17:03.354
These were Princess
Twilight's awful decisions!

17:03.356 --> 17:06.190
I'm about to blow my stack
on Princess Twilight,

17:06.192 --> 17:07.492
I'll tell you that for nothin!

17:07.494 --> 17:11.596
I'll not let Princess Twilight
give Canterlot a bad name

17:11.598 --> 17:16.634
Come on, everypony, let's go
give her a piece of our mind!

17:16.636 --> 17:19.537
Wait, you've got it all wrong!

17:19.539 --> 17:27.178
[shouts]

17:28.313 --> 17:29.514
WAIT!

17:30.582 --> 17:33.518
I mean... wait.

17:33.520 --> 17:37.488
There's an angry mob here
that demands satisfaction!

17:37.490 --> 17:38.823
It's just that, uh,

17:38.825 --> 17:40.825
we don't want to wake
the Princess, do we?

17:40.827 --> 17:42.260
Wake her? What?

17:42.262 --> 17:44.362
You're tellin' me
that she's asleep?

17:44.364 --> 17:49.801
[angry shouts]

17:49.803 --> 17:52.537
[panting]

17:52.539 --> 17:55.440
Princess! We must speak at once!

17:55.442 --> 17:59.510
SHE... IS...SLEEPING!

17:59.512 --> 18:05.149
[snoring]

18:05.151 --> 18:07.718
[sigh]

18:07.720 --> 18:12.390
I'm glad you're here, Spike.
We've got a lot to do.

18:12.392 --> 18:14.492
Do you know if the
water main was fixed?

18:14.494 --> 18:17.261
Uh, you seem well rested.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.864
I haven't slept like
that since I was a filly.

18:19.866 --> 18:23.668
Well, at least I
got one thing right.

18:23.670 --> 18:26.571
And it was the one thing
Cadance asked of me.

18:26.573 --> 18:28.506
Maybe I did do a good job today.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.875
[banging on door and yelling]

18:33.645 --> 18:35.813
Fancy Pants. What's wrong?

18:35.815 --> 18:37.882
Don't play games
with me, Princess.

18:37.884 --> 18:39.517
You know why I'm here!

18:39.519 --> 18:41.886
Is this about the special
privileges you wanted?

18:41.888 --> 18:44.489
Because this seems
a little extreme.

18:44.491 --> 18:46.557
Special privileges?

18:46.559 --> 18:49.427
The last thing on my mind
is special privileges!

18:50.462 --> 18:52.663
What's going on, Spike?

18:52.665 --> 18:56.134
Um...you needed to sleep!

18:56.136 --> 18:58.402
And Princess Cadance told me
you weren't to be disturbed!

18:58.404 --> 19:01.706
And there was this bird,
and well...long story short,

19:01.708 --> 19:04.909
I made a few decisions
on your behalf.

19:07.513 --> 19:09.747
"A few decisions?"

19:09.749 --> 19:11.849
Well, maybe more than a few.

19:11.851 --> 19:15.820
But I had good
intentions. Honest!

19:15.822 --> 19:19.657
Until I didn't anymore.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.325
I'm sorry, Twilight.

19:21.327 --> 19:23.761
I guess I got a
little carried away.

19:23.763 --> 19:27.165
It just felt so good to have
ponies caring about my opinions

19:27.167 --> 19:29.300
on such important matters.

19:29.302 --> 19:33.504
I guess I was just enjoying
feeling like a princess.

19:33.506 --> 19:36.474
Well, Spike, one of the most
important things a princess

19:36.476 --> 19:40.478
can do is realize when she's
made a mistake and fix it.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.746
How do I do that?

19:41.748 --> 19:43.514
You could start with them.

19:45.417 --> 19:49.954
[sigh] Uh, hi there, everypony.

19:49.956 --> 19:54.792
So I guess I owe you all
a pretty big apology.

19:54.794 --> 19:57.395
It's funny, here we
are at a Summit

19:57.397 --> 20:00.598
that brings together ponies
from all across Equestria

20:00.600 --> 20:03.568
and all I could think
about was myself.

20:03.570 --> 20:06.237
You all came here to celebrate
the things that make

20:06.239 --> 20:09.373
each of our cities so
unique and special.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.776
But instead of getting
into the spirit of things

20:11.778 --> 20:13.744
like all of you...

20:13.746 --> 20:17.949
I used my friend's position
to make myself feel good.

20:17.951 --> 20:32.263
♪

20:32.265 --> 20:35.866
The Canterlot ruby
goes here, old sport.

20:35.868 --> 20:38.836
And ours goes
here, dontcha know.

20:38.838 --> 20:48.946
[friendly chatter]

20:48.948 --> 20:55.319
[friendly chatter]

20:55.321 --> 20:56.954
Does this mean you forgive me?

20:56.956 --> 21:01.626
You know the whole idea of the
statue is that when each of us

21:01.628 --> 21:05.529
plays our own small part, it
adds up to somethin' grand.

21:05.531 --> 21:07.932
Quite! Just like
how all our cities

21:07.934 --> 21:10.901
make up the beautiful
land of Equestria.

21:10.903 --> 21:14.405
I hereby dedicate the
Citizens of Equestria statue

21:14.407 --> 21:17.008
to everypony who
plays their part,

21:17.010 --> 21:19.710
no matter how big or
how small.

21:19.712 --> 21:23.581
[cheers and shouts]

21:23.583 --> 21:24.849
[sniff sniff]

21:24.851 --> 21:26.550
Aw, come on!

21:26.552 --> 21:29.787
Ah...ah...ahhhh--
