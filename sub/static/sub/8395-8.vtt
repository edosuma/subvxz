00:03.410 --> 00:04.786

WE MIGHT WANT TO START HAVIN'
A SERIOUS CONVERSATION

00:06.970 --> 00:08.176

00:10.110 --> 00:11.384

00:11.490 --> 00:12.934
- IT WAS A SHORT VISIT.
NO ONE GOT HURT.

00:13.040 --> 00:14.416
- I DON'T WANT
TO BE REPLACED.

00:14.530 --> 00:16.418
- WE DO OWE IT TO EACH OTHER
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION

00:16.530 --> 00:19.078
BEFORE WE BRING JABBAR AROUND
ANYONE WE'RE DATING.

00:19.190 --> 00:21.636
- IS SETH SOMETHING
THAT I NEED TO WORRY ABOUT?

00:21.740 --> 00:22.946
- NO, I ADORE YOU.

00:23.050 --> 00:25.359
- SETH, YOU NEED HELP.

00:25.470 --> 00:27.085
- I'M GONNA REGRET
NOT LISTENING TO MY WIFE,

00:27.190 --> 00:29.465
BECAUSE IF I DID,
MAYBE WE'D STILL BE A FAMILY.

00:32.130 --> 00:35.099
- UH, AND WHAT
RELEVANT EXPERIENCE DO YOU HAVE

00:35.200 --> 00:37.304
THAT QUALIFIES YOU
FOR THIS JOB?

00:37.410 --> 00:39.583
- DEFINE
"RELEVANT EXPERIENCE."

00:39.690 --> 00:41.965
YOU KNOW?

00:42.070 --> 00:43.105
- I LIKE MUSIC.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.007
- IT'S A JOB
ANSWERING THE PHONE.

00:45.110 --> 00:47.317
BEEN DOIN' THAT
FOR MY ENTIRE LIFE.

00:47.420 --> 00:48.557
- YEAH.

00:48.660 --> 00:51.049
- FOR STARTERS,
I KNOW ALL THE LOCAL BANDS.

00:51.150 --> 00:52.242
- TELL US
ABOUT YOUR LAST JOB.

00:52.360 --> 00:53.384
- WHY?
WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD?

00:53.500 --> 00:54.876
- WHERE DO YOU SEE YOURSELF
IN TWO YEARS?

00:54.980 --> 00:57.084
- LOOK, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE
I'M GOIN' AFTER THIS MEETING.

00:57.190 --> 00:58.532
- OWNING MY OWN LABEL.

00:58.640 --> 00:59.868
- PROBABLY
OWNING MY OWN LABEL.

00:59.990 --> 01:02.049
- ULTIMATELY
I'D REALLY LIKE TO MANAGE,

01:02.160 --> 01:04.435
SO I'M HOPING THAT I'LL BE
ON TRACK TO DO THAT.

01:04.540 --> 01:05.882
- ANYTHING ELSE
YOU WANT TO TELL US?

01:05.990 --> 01:07.264
- I DON'T MAKE COFFEE.

01:07.370 --> 01:09.167
- I'M GONNA NEED THE ENTIRE
MONTH OF NOVEMBER OFF.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.192
- I'D LIKE HEALTH CARE.
YOU KNOW, 401K.

01:11.310 --> 01:12.823
- OKAY.

01:12.930 --> 01:13.851
- THIS WAS GREAT.
- YEAH.

01:13.970 --> 01:14.823
- I GUESS
JUST ONE MORE THING?

01:14.930 --> 01:17.376
- YEAH, UH,
WHY DID YOU DROP OUT?

01:17.490 --> 01:19.720
- HONESTLY,
BECAUSE I KNEW IN MY HEART

01:19.830 --> 01:23.243
THAT I'D RATHER BE AT BOTTOM
OF THE HILL THREE NIGHTS A WEEK,

01:23.350 --> 01:26.353
LISTENING TO THE NEXT GREAT BAND
THAN FINISHING MY MASTER'S,

01:26.460 --> 01:32.535
AND, UM, AS CHEESY AS IT SOUNDS,
I THINK THAT LIFE IS JUST

01:32.640 --> 01:36.292
WAY TOO SHORT TO DO ANYTHING
OTHER THAN WHAT YOU LOVE.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.288
- YEAH.
- [laughs]

01:38.400 --> 01:40.265
- YEAH, SHE WAS GOOD.
- OH, SHE'S JUST GOOD?

01:40.370 --> 01:41.405
- YOU KNOW, WE GOT SOME
OTHER PEOPLE WE HAVE TO SEE,

01:41.510 --> 01:43.057
WE'VE GOT OTHER APPLICANTS
LINED UP.

01:43.170 --> 01:45.479
- LISTEN, SHE'S SMART,
SHE'S HUMBLE,

01:45.580 --> 01:47.992
SHE KNOWS MORE
ABOUT THE MUSIC SCENE THAN I DO,

01:48.100 --> 01:49.237
SO I DON'T SEE
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM.

01:49.350 --> 01:51.511
- IT'S A PROCESS, CROSBY,
WE'VE GO'I'I'A FOLLOW IT THROUGH.

01:51.620 --> 01:53.724
- YEAH, WE JUST TOOK A LOOK
AT WHAT'S OUT THERE.

01:53.830 --> 01:54.899
WHAT IS YOUR HESITATION?

01:55.010 --> 01:56.580
_ 1--
- IS IT 'CAUSE SHE'S HOT?

01:56.700 --> 01:57.553
IT'S 'CAUSE SHE'S HOT.

01:57.660 --> 01:58.661
- I BARELY EVEN NOTICED
THAT SHE WAS HOT.

01:58.770 --> 02:01.352
- OH, YOU--YOU DIDN'T NOTICE
THAT SHE WAS HOT?

02:01.460 --> 02:02.836
DID YOU HAVE YOUR EYES CLOSED?
- [laughs]

02:02.950 --> 02:05.350
- LISTEN, IT DOES NOT MAKE US
SLEAZY IF WE HIRE A PRETTY GIRL.

02:05.470 --> 02:07.392
AND THIS IS NOT
THE SHOE INDUSTRY, OKAY?

02:07.500 --> 02:08.979
WE HAVE MUSICIANS IN HERE.

02:09.090 --> 02:11.251
IT WOULD NOT KILL US TO HAVE
A LITTLE EYE CANDY UP FRONT.

02:11.370 --> 02:12.632
- I'M GONNA PRETEND
YOU DIDN'T SAY THAT, OKAY?

02:12.750 --> 02:13.910
I KNOW IT'S NOT
THE SHOE INDUSTRY.

02:14.030 --> 02:15.019
- WELL, YOU'RE ALREADY
PRETENDING

02:15.130 --> 02:15.983
THAT YOU DIDN'T NOTICE
HOW HOT SHE IS,

02:16.100 --> 02:17.544
SO WHY NOT PRETEND THAT,
AS WELL?

02:17.650 --> 02:18.856
- ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I ADMIT IT. SHE WAS ATTRACTIVE.

02:18.960 --> 02:21.019
OKAY? YOU HAPPY?
- OH, OKAY, GOOD.

02:21.140 --> 02:22.334
HERE WE GO,
NOW WE'RE SPEAKING HONESTLY.

02:22.450 --> 02:24.964
LISTEN,
IS THIS A KRISTINA FEAR?

02:25.070 --> 02:26.958
YOU THINK SHE'S GONNA
BE THREATENED, OR SOMETHING?

02:27.070 --> 02:27.968
'CAUSE SHE'LL BE FINE.

02:28.070 --> 02:29.207
- OH, REALLY?
AND YOU KNOW THIS HOW?

02:29.320 --> 02:31.345
- 'CAUSE YOU GUYS
HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR 20 YEARS,

02:31.460 --> 02:32.973
AND YOU'RE SOMEHOW
STILL HOT FOR EACH OTHER.

02:33.080 --> 02:34.627
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE, BUT--
- YEAH.

02:34.740 --> 02:36.002
- OR NOT?
- HMM?

02:36.120 --> 02:37.314
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
THINGS AREN'T AS--

02:37.430 --> 02:40.012
- LOOK, WE'RE JUST EXPERIENCING
THE USUAL DRY SPELL

02:40.120 --> 02:42.179
AFTER A PREGNANCY, OKAY?
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

02:42.300 --> 02:43.324
DON'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT
ANYMORE.

02:43.430 --> 02:46.638
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT.

02:46.750 --> 02:47.978
- MAYBE
YOU NEED TO SEDUCE HER.

02:48.090 --> 02:49.739
- I DON'T NEED TO SEDUCE HER,
OKAY?

02:49.850 --> 02:50.782
- I'M JUST SAYIN',
YOU COULD MAKE HER A NICE MEAL,

02:50.890 --> 02:53.711
AND PUT ON MUSIC,
AND LIGHT CANDLES. THAT'LL WORK.

02:53.820 --> 02:55.515
- THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT,
CROSBY.

02:55.620 --> 02:56.826
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THIS IS.

02:56.930 --> 03:00.275
THIS IS ABOUT THE SENSITIVE TIME
AFTER HAVING A BABY,

03:00.380 --> 03:01.551
WHEN THE WOMAN HAS
BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH,

03:01.660 --> 03:03.867
THE MAN CAN'T INITIATE THINGS,
OKAY?

03:03.970 --> 03:05.938
SHE DOESN'T FEEL ATTRACTIVE,
HE'S GOTTA BE PATIENT,

03:06.040 --> 03:06.904
IT CAN GO ON FOR MONTHS.
IT'S JUST--

03:07.010 --> 03:08.170
- OKAY,
I'M SORRY I ASKED.

03:08.290 --> 03:09.803
- YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M UP AGAINST HERE.

03:09.910 --> 03:10.626
- BACK TO RACHEL.

03:10.740 --> 03:12.071
ARE WE GONNA HIRE HER?
YES OR NO?

03:12.190 --> 03:13.737
BEFORE YOU ANSWER,
LET ME WARN YOU,

03:13.840 --> 03:15.842
WE CAN'T RULE HER OUT,
JUST BECAUSE SHE'S ATTRACTIVE.

03:15.950 --> 03:17.087
THAT'S ILLEGAL.
- [laughs]

03:17.190 --> 03:18.327
- AND I DO NOT WANT TO END UP
IN A LAWSUIT OVER THIS.

03:18.430 --> 03:20.398
- YEAH, DISCRIMINATION.
- EXACTLY.

03:20.510 --> 03:21.886
- AGAINST ATTRACT IVEN ESS.
- YUP.

03:21.990 --> 03:22.979
- WELL--
- IT CAN GO BOTH WAYS.

03:23.090 --> 03:24.330
- THANK YOU FOR KEEPING US
OUT OF THE COURTROOM.

03:24.440 --> 03:26.499
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

03:26.620 --> 03:28.099
- AW, BROTHER.
- BUT AS FAR AS...

03:28.200 --> 03:29.952
- I TELL YA,
I CAN'T KEEP TRACK OF--

03:30.070 --> 03:31.583
- YOU SAID FOUR.
- TWO.

03:31.690 --> 03:32.998
- HEY, GUYS.
- THIS IS NOT--[laughs]

03:33.100 --> 03:35.102
- HEY, MR. BRAVERMAN.
- HI, AMY.

03:35.210 --> 03:38.099
GRANDSON.
- HEY.

03:38.210 --> 03:39.416
- YOU HAVEN'T SEEN MY KEYS,
HAVE YOU?

03:39.520 --> 03:42.284
- UM,
I DON'T THINK SO, NO.

03:42.390 --> 03:44.381
- HUH.
- DID YOU TAKE HIS KEYS?

03:44.500 --> 03:47.116
- I DIDN'T TAKE--
I DIDN'T TAKE YOUR KEYS.

03:47.220 --> 03:51.839
- HEY, DREW, DID YOU INVITE AMY
TO THE--TO THE PARTY?

03:51.950 --> 03:53.918

03:54.020 --> 03:55.703
- YOU DIDN'T TELL HER?

03:55.820 --> 03:57.981

03:58.090 --> 03:59.978
ON HAIGHT-ASHBURY, RIGHT?

04:00.100 --> 04:04.332
THERE'S GONNA BE MUSIC,
AND FOOD, AND FREE BAR.

04:04.450 --> 04:06.372
WAIT. I MEAN,
FORGET THAT LAST PART.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.857
- IT'S GONNA BE A TOUGH NIGHT,
I MEAN, LET'S BE HONEST.

04:08.970 --> 04:11.313
- IT ACT UALLY--
IT SOUNDS PRETTY COOL TO ME.

04:11.420 --> 04:12.409
DO YOU WANT TO GO?
- YEAH!

04:12.520 --> 04:14.078
- YOU WANT TO--I MEAN...

04:14.180 --> 04:16.102

04:18.080 --> 04:19.422

04:19.530 --> 04:20.622
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A GREAT TIME.
- THERE'S A LIST.

04:20.740 --> 04:22.048
WE'RE ON THE LIST.

04:22.150 --> 04:24.015
- WELL, YOU SHOULD INVITE
YOUR GIRLFRIEND TO STUFF, DREW,

04:24.120 --> 04:25.564
COME ON, MAN.

04:25.670 --> 04:29.015

04:29.130 --> 04:30.085
- SORRY, HE'S--

04:30.200 --> 04:32.020
- I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT THIS.

04:32.130 --> 04:36.123
- IT'S ALL GOOD.

04:36.240 --> 04:38.060

04:38.170 --> 04:41.515

04:41.620 --> 04:42.996
- DUDE, YOU'RE GONNA BREAK IT.
LET ME DO IT.

04:43.110 --> 04:43.997
LET ME TRY IT.

04:44.110 --> 04:45.725

05:00.740 --> 05:03.049
YEAH, I KNOW IT SUCKS,
BUT IT'S AFFORDABLE.

05:03.160 --> 05:05.913

07:39.250 --> 07:41.309
I DON'T THINK IT'S
THE MOST HELPFUL ENVIRONMENT,

07:41.420 --> 07:44.799

YOU KNOW, HOPE FOR THE BEST.

07:44.910 --> 07:47.834

08:01.750 --> 08:02.717

08:02.820 --> 08:04.469
- I COULD STAY HERE.

08:04.580 --> 08:05.922
IF IT'S HELPFUL.
- OH, AMBER, YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

08:06.030 --> 08:08.066
NO, NO, NO.
IT'S YOUR NEW PLACE.

08:08.170 --> 08:10.730
- MOM, IT'S OKAY,
YOU KNOW,

08:10.830 --> 08:12.582
IF IT'LL BE HELPFUL FOR YOU,

08:12.690 --> 08:15.579
IT'S TOTALLY OKAY.

08:24.020 --> 08:26.841

08:50.700 --> 08:52.031

SO THAT'S WHY THEY ASKED US.

08:59.120 --> 09:01.008

- HE WAS, BUT IT--IT ENDED UP
LOOKING MORE LIKE

14:40.120 --> 14:43.078
THE PLACE YOU GO TO DO DRUGS,

14:43.190 --> 14:45.567

HER SIDE, YOU SHOULD REALLY--

15:38.480 --> 15:40.038

23:00.620 --> 23:06.889
REALLY. I MEAN,
IT'S NOT...ABOUT...HIM.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.821
IT'S JUST...

23:09.940 --> 23:15.219
TO SEE SETH BECOMING THE MAN
I ALWAYS THOUGHT HE COULD BE

23:15.320 --> 23:22.635
ALL THOSE YEARS,
IT IS KIND OF MOVING.

23:22.740 --> 23:25.948

23:26.050 --> 23:29.122
- MM. HE'S THE FATHER
OF YOUR CHILDREN.

23:29.230 --> 23:32.848
IT HAS TO DO WITH YOUR WHOLE
SENSE OF BEING A FAMILY AGAIN.

23:32.960 --> 23:40.446
- NO, MOM, I--
I PICTURE THE TWO OF US...

BEEN HAPPIER.

23:54.120 --> 23:57.806
MARK KEEPS ASKING ME IF
THERE'S ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT,

23:57.910 --> 24:03.052

I'M FINE WITH YOU
DATIN' JASMINE. THAT'S TERRIFIC.

27:42.310 --> 27:44.585
BUT I NEED YOU TO RECOGNIZE
THAT THERE ARE MOMENTS

27:44.690 --> 27:47.488
I WANT TO SHARE WITH MY SON,
ME AND HIM, NOT YOU AND HIM.

27:47.590 --> 27:49.899
HARRY POTTER?
THAT WAS ONE OF 'EM,

27:50.010 --> 27:51.762
BUT I DON'T THINK YOU

27:51.870 --> 27:54.009
AND NOW THE FOOTBALL GAME?

27:54.120 --> 27:56.873
I AM NOT LETTING YOU TAKE HIM

27:56.980 --> 27:58.777
I DESERVE TO BE THERE
WITH HIM.

27:58.880 --> 28:01.087
I'M THE ONE THAT GETS TO SEE
HIS FACE LIGHT UP

28:01.190 --> 28:03.112
WHEN HE SEES THE FIELD
FOR THE FIRST TIME,

28:03.230 --> 28:05.630
AND I'M THE ONE WHO GETS TO
RELIVE THAT MOMENT

28:05.750 --> 28:07.957
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,
NOT YOU.

28:08.060 --> 28:10.096
SO I NEED YOU

28:42.920 --> 28:45.093
SO I JUST SWAPPED OUT
