35:04.503 --> 35:05.504
You'll see for yourself.

35:07.673 --> 35:10.509
I'm glad that we found
our way back to each other.

35:10.542 --> 35:12.344
'Cause for a while there,
I wasn't sure that we would.

35:13.812 --> 35:15.847
I couldn't ask
for a better agent.

35:15.881 --> 35:17.749
If I gain the world
and lost you,

35:17.783 --> 35:19.318
that would be
the real tragedy.

35:20.286 --> 35:21.287
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

35:40.506 --> 35:41.707
TILDA: Odessa!

35:46.445 --> 35:48.880
Mother, I'd like you
to meet Odessa.

35:51.850 --> 35:54.253
She was kept as a Doll
at the oil refinery.

35:54.286 --> 35:55.421
ODESSA: We all were.

35:57.723 --> 35:59.591
Tilda saved us.

35:59.625 --> 36:03.562
Actually, Odessa took down
one of the Clippers herself.

36:03.595 --> 36:05.464
A warrior. Good.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.966
We need as many as we can get
for the battles to come.

36:07.999 --> 36:10.202
I hope you'll decide to stay
and join our movement.

36:11.337 --> 36:12.371
Decide?

36:13.739 --> 36:14.940
You...

36:14.973 --> 36:16.575
You mean
you're not gonna force us?

36:16.608 --> 36:18.777
You don't belong to me.

36:18.810 --> 36:22.314
Everyone here
is free and equal.

36:22.348 --> 36:24.783
My dream is that one day,
there will be no Cog,

36:24.816 --> 36:26.652
Clipper, Doll, or Baron.

36:27.986 --> 36:29.488
Only free women and men

36:29.521 --> 36:30.956
deciding the course
of their own future.

36:30.989 --> 36:33.759
What happens if we don't buy
into your big dream?

36:34.793 --> 36:36.262
(GRUNTS)

36:38.264 --> 36:40.532
You'd rather
be a slave in a system

36:40.566 --> 36:42.568
that doesn't give a damn
about you?

36:42.601 --> 36:44.536
The system's treated me
well enough.

36:45.904 --> 36:47.373
And it's only
a matter of time

36:47.406 --> 36:48.674
until the other Barons
crush you.

36:51.843 --> 36:53.345
They are welcome to try.

36:54.913 --> 36:56.782
Does that mean
we are free to leave?

37:02.488 --> 37:05.291
Go, if you wish.
No one will stop you.

37:10.796 --> 37:11.897

the Master,

37:30.549 --> 37:31.817
I thought you'd be happy.

37:35.387 --> 37:36.655
Let me guess,

37:36.688 --> 37:39.525
she didn't give you
the answers you wanted.

37:39.558 --> 37:41.693
Have you been reporting
on me this whole time?

37:41.727 --> 37:43.529
All of our conversations?

37:47.766 --> 37:49.801
She wanted to know
about your progress.

37:49.835 --> 37:52.037
It's my job.
I'm your Abbot.

37:52.070 --> 37:53.905
I trusted you, Ava.

37:53.939 --> 37:56.375
I told you things that
I've never told to anybody.

38:04.783 --> 38:07.319
Thank you
for your service, Ava,

38:07.353 --> 38:08.687
but I'll be
personally overseeing

38:08.720 --> 38:10.589
this novice's training
from now on.

38:14.993 --> 38:16.528
As you wish, Master.

The hard part.

38:57.703 --> 38:59.571
How about you? What?

39:12.017 --> 39:13.385
Let me handle this.

39:20.559 --> 39:22.127
Your Baron said
we were free to go.

39:24.796 --> 39:26.131
Odessa told me

39:26.164 --> 39:27.799
what you and your men
did to those Dolls.

39:32.738 --> 39:34.773
The Widow didn't send you,

39:34.806 --> 39:35.807
did she?

40:30.596 --> 40:33.098
Turns out, we had a Picker

40:33.131 --> 40:35.634
who didn't make his quota.

40:35.667 --> 40:40.839
In fact, his haul weighed
less than zero.

I had no idea that we, uh,

40:48.046 --> 40:52.484
we had such a celebrated
killer in our midst.

40:52.518 --> 40:56.154
I heard they called you
something in the Badlands?

40:57.756 --> 41:00.492
What, what, what's the word?
Hmm?

41:03.862 --> 41:04.863
"Clipper," boss.

41:04.896 --> 41:06.231
You son of a bitch.

41:06.264 --> 41:07.999
Your friend told me
that you were planning

41:08.033 --> 41:11.703
to leave our, uh,
happy little family.

41:11.737 --> 41:15.173
And he thought that, uh,
he would trade your freedom

41:15.206 --> 41:16.608
for his.

41:16.642 --> 41:18.009
Saw an opportunity.
