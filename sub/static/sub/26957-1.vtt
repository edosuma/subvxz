- Hey!
- The party's about to start.

00:48.849 --> 00:50.916
This is a no-work zone
for the rest of the night.

00:50.985 --> 00:52.918
Well, it's not work.
It's a gift.

00:52.987 --> 00:55.754
All right, five minutes,
or you're on the naughty list.

00:55.856 --> 00:58.023
Whoo-hoo, babe, um,

00:58.092 --> 00:59.625
what do you spike
the eggnog with?

00:59.727 --> 01:00.826
Rum or Bourbon?

01:01.862 --> 01:03.595
- Either.
- Hmm…

01:05.966 --> 01:06.965
First guests!

01:07.068 --> 01:08.333
I'm not a guest?

01:08.436 --> 01:10.069
Girl, no. You're family.

01:10.171 --> 01:11.236
I'm gonna use both.

01:21.649 --> 01:23.415
Never mind,
it's just my brother.

01:25.186 --> 01:27.386
Wow. Let's dial down
the enthusiasm, sis.

01:28.322 --> 01:29.388
Hm.

01:33.994 --> 01:35.761
And careful spiking
that punch, Martin.

01:35.830 --> 01:37.763
This is a Christmas party,
not a frat party.

01:39.700 --> 01:42.568
No, no, Jack, please,
don't get up. I've got it.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.803
And a Merry Christmas
to you too, Jolie.

01:44.905 --> 01:46.772
Enough squabbling, you guys.

01:46.841 --> 01:48.874
Jack gets a pass from helping,
because he showed up.

01:48.976 --> 01:50.542
That's not fair!

01:50.644 --> 01:51.877
We made a deal.
If I came to the party,

01:51.979 --> 01:53.645
I didn't have to help decorate.

01:53.747 --> 01:55.447
A deal's a deal.

01:55.516 --> 01:56.849
Seriously? That is
the standard he's held to?

01:56.917 --> 01:58.851
- Showing up?
- Yep.

01:58.919 --> 02:00.853
I do not want a repeat of
my wedding, where you two were

02:00.921 --> 02:02.888
just fighting all night about
who's giving the last toast.

02:02.990 --> 02:04.556
Yeah, I'm a writer

02:04.658 --> 02:06.024
and her brother,
so it should've been me.

02:06.127 --> 02:07.359
I was the maid of honor.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.061
All right, look, just

02:09.163 --> 02:10.795
be pleasant when
the guests arrive, all right?

02:10.865 --> 02:12.498
OK.

02:12.566 --> 02:14.766
What? Him?
He's always a grump, but you?

02:14.835 --> 02:16.768
Why are you so fussy?

02:16.837 --> 02:19.238
Come on, it's Christmas.
Aren't you excited to go home?

02:19.306 --> 02:20.873
- About that.
- What?

02:20.941 --> 02:22.541
- You're not going home?
- No, I'm going home,

02:22.610 --> 02:25.911
but so is Foster
and his new girlfriend.

02:26.013 --> 02:27.813
- Already?
- Mm-hmm.

02:27.882 --> 02:29.481
I know, I just found out today.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.483
- It's only been six months!
- I know!

02:31.585 --> 02:33.619
I was freaked out knowing that
I was gonna have to see him,

02:33.687 --> 02:35.554
and now, I'm gonna have to
hang out with him <i> and</i> her

02:35.656 --> 02:36.989
the whole time.

02:37.091 --> 02:38.557
Do you have to see him?

02:38.659 --> 02:40.459
Yeah, our dads
are getting this big award,

02:40.528 --> 02:41.660
because they've been putting
on the Christmas Market

02:41.729 --> 02:43.228
for, like, 30 years,

02:43.297 --> 02:45.130
so the mayor's giving
them keys to the city.

02:45.199 --> 02:46.798
And then, our parents
do this big bonfire

02:46.901 --> 02:48.534
right before Christmas Eve
every year, and

02:48.602 --> 02:50.869
they've been doing it
since we were kids.

02:50.971 --> 02:52.738
Any chance of breaking
those traditions?

02:52.806 --> 02:55.507
I mean, I can probably
skip that bonfire, but…

02:55.576 --> 02:58.043
No, the market's really
really special to my family.

02:58.145 --> 03:00.112
And me.

03:00.181 --> 03:01.813
What if you bring a date?

03:01.882 --> 03:04.650
Oh, yes, cool, I'll just
go get a date real fast.

03:04.718 --> 03:07.586
Every guy I know
is either married or…

03:07.688 --> 03:09.555
or related to me.

03:09.623 --> 03:12.090
All right, it's gonna be OK.
We'll think of something.

03:14.428 --> 03:16.895
<i>♪ Oh, jingle bells, ♪
♪ jingle bells ♪</i>

03:16.964 --> 03:18.897
<i>♪ Jingle all the way ♪</i>

03:18.966 --> 03:21.366
<i>♪ Oh, what fun ♪
♪ it is to ride… ♪</i>

03:21.435 --> 03:23.235
All right,
let's find you a date.

03:23.337 --> 03:25.204
<i>♪ Jingle bell, jingle bells ♪</i>

03:25.272 --> 03:27.039
<i>♪ Jingle all the way ♪</i>

03:27.141 --> 03:28.273
<i>♪ Oh, what fun… ♪</i>

03:28.375 --> 03:30.042
Maybe…

03:31.612 --> 03:32.811
Nope!

03:34.148 --> 03:35.514
Here we go.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.483
Oh…

03:41.889 --> 03:44.990
But like, it's not as
exciting as it sounds, you know?

03:45.059 --> 03:46.658
In fact, most publishers,
they only wanna sell books…

03:46.760 --> 03:48.694
And, bingo.

03:50.598 --> 03:52.064
Hey, big brother,

03:52.132 --> 03:54.533
remind me of
your Christmas plans again.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.735
You know how I'm going to
Colorado with Martin's family,

03:56.804 --> 03:59.238
and Mom and Dad are doing
that Mediterranean cruise?

03:59.306 --> 04:00.839
I feel like you've lectured
me about this already.

04:00.941 --> 04:02.074
Uh, I don't have any plans.

04:02.142 --> 04:03.642
I'm just gonna be writing.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.644
- You should go home with Jolie.
- What?

04:05.746 --> 04:08.180
Yeah, you'll spend Christmas
in Louisiana with the Guidrys.

04:08.282 --> 04:10.048
What?

04:10.117 --> 04:11.550
You're always saying
you wanna travel more.

04:11.619 --> 04:13.085
Yeah. Alone.

04:13.153 --> 04:14.386
You can be alone anytime.

04:14.455 --> 04:16.255
What am I missing?

04:16.322 --> 04:19.124
What Naomi is doing with
the subtlety of a baboon,

04:19.192 --> 04:21.226
I might add, is trying to
get me a date for Christmas,

04:21.295 --> 04:24.529
'cause Foster's bringing home
a new cute girlfriend, so…

04:24.598 --> 04:26.832
You don't have to go
with me to Louisiana.

04:26.900 --> 04:29.234
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You should go.

04:29.336 --> 04:31.236
Listen, the food alone
is worth the trip.

04:31.305 --> 04:32.738
Martin!

04:32.806 --> 04:34.840
Exactly. And you can
write from anywhere.

04:34.908 --> 04:37.609
Guys, he'd be, like,
pretending to be my boyfriend.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.711
That's… It's weird.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.780
- I'm weird?
- No, I mean, you're not…

04:41.882 --> 04:44.216
You're not weird,
but the situation is weird.

04:44.285 --> 04:46.084
See? There you go. You
already sound like a couple.

04:46.186 --> 04:48.387
No, we don't.

04:48.455 --> 04:51.456
OK, what if it's more like
a buffer than a boyfriend?

04:51.525 --> 04:55.327
You know, a plus-one
to make it less… awkward.

04:55.396 --> 04:57.162
Oh,<i> less</i> awkward. Cool.

04:57.264 --> 04:59.097
Exactly, but, baby,

04:59.166 --> 05:00.732
what would Jack
be getting out of this?

05:00.801 --> 05:03.001
Yeah, what would Jack
be getting out of this?

05:03.103 --> 05:07.372
The joy of knowing that
you're helping out a friend.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.207
Ooh, hard pass.

05:10.844 --> 05:14.446
Actually, I could use
a website for my novel.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.882
Yes! Perfect.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.017
No. I mean, no offense,
but you're just

05:19.086 --> 05:21.053
not the most reliable guy.

05:21.155 --> 05:22.387
What does that mean?

05:22.489 --> 05:24.056
I'm sorry, do you not remember,

05:24.158 --> 05:25.824
what was that,
like, 5 months ago?

05:25.893 --> 05:27.793
OK, wait, hold on,
what am I missing?

05:27.895 --> 05:29.695
She didn't tell you?

05:29.797 --> 05:32.964
Martin. OK, when I moved here,
like, 6 months ago,

05:33.033 --> 05:35.067
Naomi thought
it would be a great idea

05:35.135 --> 05:37.836
to set me up with her brother,
because I didn't know anybody.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.705
Only, Jack stood me up!

05:39.773 --> 05:42.007
Woop, no. I did not!
I did not stand you up.

05:42.076 --> 05:44.776
I called and cancelled.
There's a very big difference.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.878
Either way, you flaked!
So how do I know

05:46.947 --> 05:48.613
I'm not gonna put all
this work into a website

05:48.682 --> 05:50.949
and you just won't show up
at the airport?

05:51.018 --> 05:52.651
You know, if I was
at the office,

05:52.720 --> 05:54.252
this would be a quick fix.

05:54.355 --> 05:55.654
What do you mean?

05:55.756 --> 05:57.189
Easy.

05:57.291 --> 05:58.590
I'd write a contract.

06:00.294 --> 06:02.894
Oh, come on!
You both could sign,

06:02.996 --> 06:04.062
No!

06:04.131 --> 06:05.230
I… I…

06:05.299 --> 06:07.199
Let me do this!

06:07.267 --> 06:08.667
They didn't give me that
fancy law degree for nothing.

06:08.769 --> 06:11.670
- No, that's…
- Jack…

06:11.739 --> 06:14.072
You'd get a website, she'd
get a date, everyone wins!

06:15.442 --> 06:17.342
Look, I'm… I'm sorry…

06:17.411 --> 06:20.679
but, you know, I was planning
on writing alone this Christmas.

06:20.748 --> 06:23.482
See? There you guys go.
We're good.

06:48.008 --> 06:50.742
All right, Devon,
give me some good news.

06:50.811 --> 06:54.479
I have something,
but you're not gonna like it.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.348
Are you aware you say that
every time we meet?

06:56.450 --> 06:57.916
It's a ghostwriting gig,

06:58.018 --> 07:00.152
and I know how you feel
about ghostwriting.

07:00.220 --> 07:03.588
Yeah, I'm over it. I just
wanna write my own stuff.

07:03.690 --> 07:05.190
I'll tell you what.

07:05.292 --> 07:07.325
If you promise to
get this one done,

07:07.394 --> 07:10.195
I will try and get some real
traction with your manuscript.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.436
A romance? Devon, come on!

07:17.538 --> 07:19.271
What? You can do it.

07:19.373 --> 07:22.874
I don't do romance.
I've never written romance.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.976
Is this one of those
Parker Hollowell novels?

07:25.045 --> 07:26.111
They sell like hotcakes.

07:26.213 --> 07:28.180
Ugh, they're terrible,

07:28.248 --> 07:30.348
and they're all exactly the
same except in a new setting.

07:30.451 --> 07:33.285
Do you want it or not?

07:36.256 --> 07:37.823
You promise to send
my manuscript

07:37.891 --> 07:39.758
to <i> every</i> publisher you know?

07:39.860 --> 07:41.560
I promise.

07:41.662 --> 07:43.662
Is this the outline
I'm supposed to go off of?

07:43.730 --> 07:46.765
"Dance under the stars"?
"Flee from danger together"?

07:46.867 --> 07:48.400
"Teach a skill"?

07:48.502 --> 07:50.302
"Profess love in
a passionate speech"!

07:50.370 --> 07:53.505
That one's original!
This isn't a plot.

07:53.574 --> 07:55.040
This is a terrible to-do list.

07:55.108 --> 07:57.042
He's gotten pretty lazy lately.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.877
You think?

07:58.946 --> 08:00.712
Here.

08:00.814 --> 08:01.847
Read this.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.819
Have your characters do
everything on that list and

08:07.888 --> 08:10.088
follow the same plot
as all his other books,

08:10.157 --> 08:13.492
except this one just has
to be set in Louisiana.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.729
Did you say Louisiana?

08:25.372 --> 08:27.405
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, sis.</i>

08:27.474 --> 08:29.107
I was thinking more
about your offer

08:29.209 --> 08:31.510
to go Louisiana with
Jolie for Christmas.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.020
Hey!

08:43.056 --> 08:45.690
Jolie. Sit down.

08:47.294 --> 08:48.793
You texted me
this was an emergency

08:48.896 --> 08:49.928
and I had to come
over right away.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.196
What's he doing here?

08:51.265 --> 08:52.397
It's nice to see you, too.

08:52.466 --> 08:54.232
It is an emergency.

08:54.301 --> 08:56.968
The two people I care
most about are in trouble,

08:57.070 --> 08:59.070
and they need my help.

08:59.139 --> 09:02.541
My best friend,
my beautiful genius,

09:02.609 --> 09:05.310
my sad, lonely,
broken-hearted bestie…

09:05.412 --> 09:06.878
Thank you.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.713
Needs guidance
through her breakup

09:08.815 --> 09:12.417
and a distraction to keep
her Christmas jolly and bright.

09:13.820 --> 09:15.754
And my big brother,

09:15.856 --> 09:20.091
whose professional life is
in a dismal, downward spiral,

09:20.160 --> 09:22.394
desperately needs to
jump-start his career

09:22.462 --> 09:24.963
and rebrand himself as
not a ghostwriter

09:25.065 --> 09:27.432
but a proper novelist.

09:27.501 --> 09:28.700
Are you done?

09:29.870 --> 09:31.269
What I have before me

09:31.371 --> 09:32.871
is the Christmas contract.

09:34.575 --> 09:36.241
Solves both problems.

09:36.310 --> 09:40.745
And all you have to do
is sign on the dotted line.

09:40.814 --> 09:42.948
That was a
beautiful speech, Naomi,

09:43.016 --> 09:45.550
but I'm pretty sure your brother
made it clear last night

09:45.619 --> 09:47.018
that he's not interested.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.521
Actually, I've been
thinking about it

09:49.623 --> 09:52.257
and I think it's a good
deal, for both of us.

09:52.359 --> 09:54.159
So, I'm down if you are.

09:54.227 --> 09:55.694
I mean, I don't…

09:55.762 --> 09:57.495
I don't know. It's…

09:57.564 --> 09:59.197
I thought you might say that.

09:59.299 --> 10:02.367
Foster posted this on
social media last night.

10:09.409 --> 10:10.542
Where do I sign?

10:12.079 --> 10:13.011
Here you go.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.646
Thank you.

10:28.495 --> 10:31.630
Great! I'll go make copies.

10:42.175 --> 10:43.908
You like
Parker Hollowell novels?

10:45.278 --> 10:46.311
Sure.

10:47.914 --> 10:49.948
You don't think they're
a little bit like…

10:50.017 --> 10:52.083
- Sappy? Yeah.
- Yep.

10:54.588 --> 10:56.154
I mean, my mom really likes him.

10:56.256 --> 10:58.423
Hmm.

10:58.492 --> 10:59.858
You do know you're going to have
to talk to my family, right?

10:59.926 --> 11:01.826
I know.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.395
You can't just sit in a corner
and read a book the whole time.

11:03.497 --> 11:04.529
Yeah, I got it.

11:04.631 --> 11:05.597
OK.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.500
OK, so what are
we doing right now?

11:08.568 --> 11:10.135
Is your family here right now?

11:10.203 --> 11:12.871
Oh, my God!
This is gonna be a disaster.

11:16.743 --> 11:18.109
- OK.
- Mm-hmm.

11:20.313 --> 11:22.380
One for you…

11:22.449 --> 11:25.016
And one for you.

11:25.085 --> 11:27.585
I love you both.
Have a very Merry Christmas.

11:28.655 --> 11:30.121
Oh!

11:31.425 --> 11:34.392
- I love you.
- Bye, sis.

11:34.494 --> 11:36.194
Don't forget to call me.

11:36.296 --> 11:38.496
Don't kill each other.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.828
Thanks for picking us up, Dad.

12:09.930 --> 12:12.664
Of course. It's so good
to see you, Jo-Jo.

12:12.766 --> 12:14.532
It's good to
have you here, Jack.

12:17.471 --> 12:19.704
Oh, yeah. It's uh, it's
great to be here, sir.

12:19.806 --> 12:23.041
We've had Naomi over here,
uh, a half a dozen times.

12:23.110 --> 12:27.011
We adore her. Smart as a whip.
Good people.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.980
<i>In two days, folks,
make your way to the 30th</i>

12:29.049 --> 12:31.583
<i>- annual Christmas Market at Acadian Village.</i>
- Hey!

12:31.651 --> 12:33.351
<i>Bring your family and friends.</i>

12:33.453 --> 12:35.920
<i>It's gonna be a great
one this year.</i>

12:35.989 --> 12:37.956
So this is the Christmas
Market I was telling you about

12:38.058 --> 12:40.291
that my dad and Foster's, uh…

12:40.360 --> 12:42.427
Mr. Rocky have been
running for 30 years.

12:42.496 --> 12:44.796
Yeah. You ready to
check out the maze?

12:44.898 --> 12:47.298
I'm sure Jolie's
told you all about it.

12:47.400 --> 12:48.733
He is so excited.

12:48.835 --> 12:50.301
He just can't stop
talking about it.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.637
You betcha! Yeah, I can't wait.

13:23.403 --> 13:24.636
Home sweet home.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.373
Hello!

13:29.910 --> 13:32.210
Is that my big city girl?

13:32.312 --> 13:34.078
Hi, Momma. I missed you!

13:34.181 --> 13:35.880
Oh, I missed you so much, honey.

13:35.949 --> 13:36.848
This must be Jack.

13:36.950 --> 13:37.882
Hi.

13:37.984 --> 13:39.517
A fun surprise.

13:39.619 --> 13:40.718
Did you hear that?
I'm a fun surprise.

13:40.821 --> 13:42.620
I never used the word fun.

13:42.689 --> 13:44.122
Aunt Jolie!

13:44.191 --> 13:46.624
What's up, honey? You're so big!

13:46.726 --> 13:48.726
And this is Jolie's
sister Breonna.

13:48.829 --> 13:50.061
Hi.

13:50.130 --> 13:51.663
So you're the secret boyfriend

13:51.731 --> 13:53.198
we've heard absolutely
nothin' about.

13:53.300 --> 13:54.599
Bri… Hi.

13:56.770 --> 13:58.002
Luc.

13:58.071 --> 14:00.071
Jack. It's good to meet you.

14:00.140 --> 14:02.106
Well, listen now, why don't
you guys go settle in a bit,

14:02.209 --> 14:03.641
and we'll see you
after a while. OK?

14:03.710 --> 14:04.876
Yeah.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.783
Uh, Jack, uh, you're in here.

14:11.885 --> 14:12.917
Great.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.825
"Twas the night
before Christmas,

14:20.894 --> 14:23.761
and all through the house

14:23.830 --> 14:27.465
Did not a thing pass,
not even a mouse.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.267
The children were nuzzled…"

14:29.336 --> 14:31.336
- Hi, Momma.
- Hi, sweetie.

14:32.672 --> 14:35.473
Hmm, wow. These are beautiful.

14:35.575 --> 14:37.976
Oh! Flattery'll get
you everywhere, Jack.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.178
Mom's got a booth
at the Christmas Market.

14:40.247 --> 14:41.813
Ornate Noel.

14:41.882 --> 14:44.249
Yes, that's me.
Practically famous.

14:44.351 --> 14:47.218
Practically? She runs it
with Miss Meredith.

14:47.287 --> 14:48.953
They sell out every year.

14:49.022 --> 14:50.588
Who's Miss Meredith?

14:50.657 --> 14:54.092
Uh, Meredith Broussard.
That is Foster's mom.

14:54.194 --> 14:56.494
So, Mr. Rocky's wife.

14:56.596 --> 14:57.962
Yeah.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.731
Enough about Foster.

14:59.833 --> 15:01.232
So, Jack, tell us how
you two got together.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.134
Jolie sort of sprung this on us.

15:03.203 --> 15:04.369
Oh, yeah. That's just 'cause,

15:04.437 --> 15:05.670
you know, it was really new.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.238
Mm-hmm.

15:07.307 --> 15:08.740
So I just wanted
to keep it quiet.

15:08.808 --> 15:10.241
Yeah. Real new.

15:10.310 --> 15:11.342
Yeah.

15:11.411 --> 15:12.410
I'll get that.

15:15.348 --> 15:16.514
Have a seat, Jack.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.483
- Coffee?
- Yes, ma'am.

15:29.362 --> 15:30.528
- Foster!
- Hey!

15:30.630 --> 15:31.896
Hi.

15:31.998 --> 15:32.997
Come in.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.766
Thanks. Uh…

15:34.868 --> 15:36.801
Oh, wow, it looks great.

15:36.870 --> 15:40.138
Um, I didn't think you were
gonna be home until tomorrow.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.506
Oh!

15:41.608 --> 15:43.041
- Hi!
- Hi.

15:43.143 --> 15:44.342
- This is Amy.
- It's nice to meet you.

15:44.444 --> 15:45.877
Yeah, you too.

15:45.979 --> 15:47.178
I don't think
I caught your name.

15:49.683 --> 15:51.049
It's Jolie.

15:51.151 --> 15:52.183
Oh, right.

15:52.252 --> 15:53.818
You know, I'm just here

15:53.887 --> 15:55.320
to drop off some stuff
for the market.

15:55.422 --> 15:57.388
Cool! Oh, yeah. Come on through.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.164
Just go with it.

16:06.266 --> 16:07.165
Parrain!

16:07.233 --> 16:09.634
Maximillio!

16:09.736 --> 16:10.935
What did she just call him?

16:11.037 --> 16:12.971
Parrain. That means godfather.

16:13.039 --> 16:14.238
Hey!

16:14.307 --> 16:16.240
Oh, I like your dress!

16:18.211 --> 16:20.178
Oh, hey, man. I'm uh, Foster.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.046
Hey. Jack.

16:22.115 --> 16:23.314
I'd shake your hand,
but she's sitting on mine.

16:23.416 --> 16:26.250
What? Oh, I'm sorry.

16:26.353 --> 16:27.318
Hey.

16:29.022 --> 16:30.855
- Hey, Mr. Tim!
- Foster!

16:30.957 --> 16:32.690
I got those signs and
banners from the printer's,

16:32.759 --> 16:33.958
if you want to take
a look at them.

16:34.027 --> 16:35.593
Oh, that's perfect. Perfect!

16:35.662 --> 16:37.428
We're gonna set them up
first thing tomorrow.

16:37.497 --> 16:41.733
Hey Luc, come help me
load them into the truck.

16:41.801 --> 16:43.868
Oh, I'd give you a hand
if you'd like, Tim.

16:43.937 --> 16:47.939
Uh, no thanks, Jack. We're good.

16:51.144 --> 16:56.114
So, uh, Jack, uh… we really
don't know much about you.

16:56.216 --> 16:58.282
- What do you do for a living?
- I'm a writer.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.651
A writer. That's interesting.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.487
- What do you write?
- Usually novels.

17:02.589 --> 17:03.821
Mostly thrillers.

17:03.890 --> 17:06.790
Really? I mean, yeah, usually.

17:06.893 --> 17:08.925
So, who asked who out?

17:08.994 --> 17:10.028
I did.

17:12.098 --> 17:15.967
I mean, you did, but I did also.

17:16.036 --> 17:17.635
At the same time?

17:17.704 --> 17:19.436
Well, no. Actually,
we had both texted,

17:19.506 --> 17:20.972
I mean, that we were interested,

17:21.074 --> 17:22.673
and then she made
the connection.

17:22.776 --> 17:25.542
So yeah, we were
connected simultaneously.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.845
I see… I think.

17:27.914 --> 17:30.014
Well, that's a sweet story.

17:30.083 --> 17:31.616
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.584
So, what did you do
on your first date?

17:35.355 --> 17:36.854
We went out.

17:36.956 --> 17:38.222
Yep.

17:41.061 --> 17:42.727
I picked her up
from her apartment,

17:42.796 --> 17:44.829
and uh, we walked
to Central Park.

17:44.931 --> 17:46.764
From her apartment?

17:46.866 --> 17:49.200
No, uh, he's just forgetting
that we rode the subway uptown.

17:49.302 --> 17:50.301
- Yeah.
- <i>Then we walked.</i>

17:50.403 --> 17:52.336
Obviously, yeah.

17:52.439 --> 17:54.572
Once we got off the subway,
we walked through Central Park

17:54.641 --> 17:56.340
to this great little
restaurant called Girard's.

17:56.443 --> 17:59.043
Yeah. I had the chicken
and he had the salmon.

17:59.145 --> 18:01.245
When I brought up
the crawfish boil,

18:01.314 --> 18:02.680
you said that he had
a seafood allergy.

18:02.782 --> 18:04.248
Yep, I do.

18:04.317 --> 18:05.383
- Did I say salmon?
- You did.

18:05.452 --> 18:06.884
Oh!

18:06.953 --> 18:08.319
I meant to say he had the steak.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.321
Anyways, after dinner,

18:10.390 --> 18:12.323
we walked up Fifth Avenue to
my favorite little jazz spot

18:12.392 --> 18:13.825
and we hung out there
for a couple hours

18:13.893 --> 18:15.827
and then grabbed
a couple of oolong teas

18:15.929 --> 18:17.595
and wandered around
the city and talked.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.730
Oolong's my favorite.

18:19.833 --> 18:21.332
I know.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.767
And then, I love
to tell this part,

18:22.869 --> 18:24.969
but she doesn't like it, uh,

18:25.038 --> 18:27.672
she admitted that she had read
<i>everything</i> I'd ever written,

18:27.740 --> 18:29.474
- and was like a huge fan.
- Well…

18:29.542 --> 18:30.808
It was almost a little bit
too much, you know,

18:30.877 --> 18:32.710
but it was kind of cute.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.680
I definitely don't
remember it like that.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.315
Oh, that's pretty romantic.

18:37.417 --> 18:40.952
That is Jack. Mr. Romance.

18:51.331 --> 18:54.732
Oh, yes! Absolutely.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.911
Hey, come on, you guys!

19:07.013 --> 19:08.746
Come on, you all.
Come dance with us.

19:08.815 --> 19:09.714
Dance!

19:09.816 --> 19:11.115
Mom!

19:11.217 --> 19:12.283
Come dance with us.

19:12.385 --> 19:13.951
It's your song! Come on!

19:14.888 --> 19:16.154
Come on!

19:16.256 --> 19:17.855
Go, go!

19:17.957 --> 19:19.190
OK.

19:26.733 --> 19:29.700
<i>♪ That all has a strange ♪
♪ way of changin' ♪</i>

19:29.802 --> 19:33.638
OK…

19:33.740 --> 19:35.940
FYI, this is my favorite song.

19:36.009 --> 19:37.041
Feels like something
I should know.

19:37.110 --> 19:38.776
Mm-hmm.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.711
Tyler Hilton,
"When I See You, I See Home."

19:40.813 --> 19:44.315
He's actually playing
the Christmas Market this year.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.217
"When I See You, I See Home."

19:46.319 --> 19:48.152
Tyler Hilton. Got it.

19:48.221 --> 19:49.253
Good.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.957
Breonna, do you have
your phone with you?

19:53.026 --> 19:54.992
- Yeah. Oh!
- Let's take a picture of them.

19:55.094 --> 19:56.627
This is their first Christmas.

19:56.696 --> 19:57.962
Mom, we're good.

19:59.332 --> 20:02.633
All right, you two.
Get in close.

20:02.735 --> 20:05.436
Mm-hmm.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.004
Closer.

20:08.575 --> 20:10.141
Oh, look, there's mistletoe.

20:10.243 --> 20:11.576
Oh!

20:11.678 --> 20:13.444
Now you gotta kiss!

20:13.513 --> 20:15.646
- Yeah.
- Come on, kiss!

20:19.819 --> 20:21.485
- Good work.
- Yep.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.824
<i>Naomi, I just don't
think it's gonna work.</i>

20:26.893 --> 20:29.026
Oh, come on, it can't be
that bad already.

20:29.095 --> 20:31.229
My family just tried
to make us kiss!

20:31.331 --> 20:33.564
What did you do?

20:33.666 --> 20:35.533
<i>Well, I faked it.</i>

20:35.635 --> 20:36.734
Baby, is that Jolie?

20:36.836 --> 20:37.969
<i>Hey.</i>

20:38.071 --> 20:38.936
Hey, Jolie. How you doin'?

20:39.038 --> 20:40.671
<i>Ugh!</i>

20:40.740 --> 20:41.906
Apparently, she's
fake-kissing my brother.

20:42.008 --> 20:43.541
Shush!

20:43.610 --> 20:46.077
You know what, I don't
even wanna ask about it.

20:50.817 --> 20:53.451
OK, other than that,
how's it going?

20:53.553 --> 20:54.852
Well, before or after

20:54.954 --> 20:56.554
Foster showed up
with his girlfriend?

20:56.656 --> 20:57.755
Ugh, he would.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.223
<i>I know, right?</i>

20:59.325 --> 21:00.858
He claimed that
they didn't realize

21:00.960 --> 21:02.126
I was gonna be home
or something dumb.

21:02.228 --> 21:05.129
Baby, the cab's here. Let's go.

21:05.231 --> 21:07.198
All right. I'm sorry, Jolie,
I gotta go.

21:07.267 --> 21:08.633
<i>The cab's here to
take us to the airport.</i>

21:08.701 --> 21:10.001
OK. Yeah, I gotta go, too.

21:10.103 --> 21:11.435
I love you. Bye.

21:13.039 --> 21:14.071
It's Naomi.

21:14.173 --> 21:15.172
Ah.

21:17.844 --> 21:19.210
So?

21:20.513 --> 21:22.346
- You and Jack?
- Mm-hmm.

21:22.415 --> 21:24.015
It's a little bit surprising

21:24.083 --> 21:26.317
being that he's
Naomi's brother and all.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.120
Yeah. I mean, I guess so.

21:30.423 --> 21:32.423
And bringing Jack here

21:32.492 --> 21:35.893
has nothing to do with Foster
bringing his girlfriend home?

21:35.995 --> 21:37.628
No, it doesn't.

21:37.697 --> 21:39.730
I mean, Foster can
bring anybody he likes.

21:39.832 --> 21:41.299
I don't care.

21:41.401 --> 21:43.968
Some people might think
it's a little soon.

21:44.070 --> 21:46.237
Right.
But it doesn't bother you.

21:46.306 --> 21:48.072
Mm-mmm. No, not a bit.

21:51.778 --> 21:54.512
It's OK if
you're still a little hurt.

21:54.580 --> 21:56.247
That's not what this is about.

21:56.316 --> 21:59.750
I brought Jack
'cause I like Jack.

22:01.754 --> 22:04.588
- OK, I believe you.
- OK. Good.

22:04.657 --> 22:05.856
But just know I'm on your side.

22:05.925 --> 22:07.725
There's no side!

22:07.794 --> 22:09.760
Yeah, but I'm your sister.
I'm always on your side.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.429
Come on, Bri…

22:11.497 --> 22:13.331
OK.

22:13.399 --> 22:16.500
Well, I better get
the kiddo and head home.

22:16.602 --> 22:19.070
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

22:19.172 --> 22:22.206
I'm happy you're here.
I miss you.

22:27.146 --> 22:29.380
- Bye.
- Good night!

22:29.449 --> 22:32.116
Ugh, Breonna caught me
talking to your sister

22:32.218 --> 22:33.884
about our little arrangement.

22:33.953 --> 22:34.852
Do you think she's on to us?

22:34.954 --> 22:36.520
I don't know.

22:36.589 --> 22:38.255
We can't afford
anymore slip-ups though,

22:38.324 --> 22:40.224
so, can we just get
our stories straight?

22:40.293 --> 22:42.793
If this thing goes south,
do I still get my website?

22:42.895 --> 22:44.628
Focus.

22:44.731 --> 22:47.031
You got anymore allergies
I need to know about?

22:47.133 --> 22:48.199
None. You?

22:48.301 --> 22:50.901
Nope, no allergies.

22:50.970 --> 22:52.670
I should probably know
what you do for a living.

22:52.772 --> 22:54.939
Uh, something with websites.

22:55.007 --> 22:56.340
I work for Bravoso Media.

22:56.409 --> 22:57.541
I'm a UX designer.

22:58.945 --> 23:00.745
So yes, websites.

23:00.813 --> 23:02.513
Websites. Let's go with that.

23:04.817 --> 23:06.784
What's your favorite
thing you've ever written?

23:06.853 --> 23:09.053
Probably the first essay
I've had published.

23:09.122 --> 23:10.554
It was just in a small
literary magazine,

23:10.623 --> 23:12.056
but I was really proud of it.

23:14.227 --> 23:16.060
What's your favorite restaurant?

23:16.162 --> 23:17.628
Girard's.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.164
Girard's from the fake date?

23:20.233 --> 23:22.400
Yes, Girard's from
the fake date.

23:24.437 --> 23:27.505
So, how did you know that
oolong tea was my favorite?

23:27.573 --> 23:30.274
'Cause you said so
at Naomi's rehearsal dinner.

23:32.211 --> 23:34.245
It was after the meal, and
everyone was getting coffee,

23:34.313 --> 23:36.080
and you asked the waiter
if they had tea,

23:36.182 --> 23:38.082
and you got really excited

23:38.184 --> 23:40.618
because they had
your favorite, oolong.

23:42.221 --> 23:44.922
It's a little bit weird
that you know that.

23:45.024 --> 23:46.157
It's not weird.

23:48.027 --> 23:49.794
Well, maybe we'll survive
this Christmas after all.

24:00.473 --> 24:01.472
Need any help?

24:02.842 --> 24:04.508
Thanks.

24:04.610 --> 24:06.310
I was downstairs
talking to your boyfriend.!

24:06.379 --> 24:07.511
My boyfriend?

24:08.848 --> 24:10.214
- Jack.
- Oh, right. Yeah.

24:10.316 --> 24:11.715
Yeah.

24:11.818 --> 24:13.250
Anyway, he seems
like a really nice man.

24:13.319 --> 24:14.385
Mm-hmm.

24:14.487 --> 24:15.419
Handsome, too.

24:15.521 --> 24:17.254
Yes.

24:17.356 --> 24:19.957
Seems like you guys
are pretty serious.

24:20.059 --> 24:21.025
It does?

24:22.395 --> 24:23.861
You brought him home
for Christmas.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.196
I mean, yes, of course.

24:25.298 --> 24:27.832
I brought him home.

24:27.900 --> 24:31.068
Oh, this is pretty.

24:31.137 --> 24:33.804
OK, look, I can't believe
that you didn't tell me

24:33.873 --> 24:36.874
that you were seeing someone,
and then you bring Jack home.

24:36.976 --> 24:39.343
You guys are really
good friends with Foster,

24:39.445 --> 24:41.679
so I just… I don't know.

24:41.747 --> 24:44.048
Well, honey,
we just want you to be happy.

24:44.150 --> 24:45.349
That's all.

24:45.451 --> 24:47.485
I know.

24:47.553 --> 24:50.054
And it seems like
Jack makes you happy.

24:51.324 --> 24:52.590
Deliriously.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.125
All right, then.

24:56.696 --> 24:58.195
- Good night.
- Good night.

24:58.264 --> 24:59.797
And don't stay up too late.

25:48.014 --> 25:49.547
Finishing touches.

25:50.983 --> 25:53.651
And Merry Christmas, Dad!

26:05.164 --> 26:06.363
Morning, peanut.

26:06.465 --> 26:07.665
Good morning!

26:07.767 --> 26:09.199
Smells good, Daddy. Pancakes?

26:09.302 --> 26:10.935
- You know it.
- Coffee in the pot.

26:11.037 --> 26:12.369
Thank you.

26:12.471 --> 26:15.039
Are you gonna wake up Jack?

26:15.141 --> 26:16.640
Aw, let him sleep in.

26:16.742 --> 26:19.143
Well, he's not gonna
want to miss breakfast.

26:19.245 --> 26:20.744
- Ooh!
- Hey!

26:20.846 --> 26:22.680
- What?
- Go wake him up!

26:27.286 --> 26:28.485
Jack?

26:29.455 --> 26:30.955
Hey.

26:31.023 --> 26:33.223
Did you sleep
like that all night?

26:33.326 --> 26:35.092
Yeah. I guess I did.

26:36.262 --> 26:37.628
Are you OK?

26:37.730 --> 26:40.264
Hmm? Yeah.

26:40.366 --> 26:42.299
Good morning, by the way.
How are you?

26:42.368 --> 26:44.001
I'm good, thank you.

26:44.070 --> 26:46.704
We are all eating pancakes
in the kitchen

26:46.772 --> 26:48.572
if you're interested.

26:48.641 --> 26:50.174
Unless, of course,
you're allergic to those, too.

26:50.276 --> 26:51.976
Are they gluten-free?

26:52.044 --> 26:53.744
What?

26:55.081 --> 26:56.480
No, they're normal pancakes.

26:56.549 --> 26:58.415
Why didn't you say
anything last night?

26:58.517 --> 27:00.351
Are you seriously gluten-free?

27:00.419 --> 27:01.952
Mm, no, I love pancakes.

27:02.021 --> 27:04.221
You're kind of grouchy
in the morning.

27:08.527 --> 27:09.994
There you go, Jack.

27:10.096 --> 27:11.295
Thank you.

27:11.397 --> 27:13.030
Do you want some more, peanut?

27:13.099 --> 27:14.898
- Do you even have to ask?
- That's my girl.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.767
What time do you want
to go to the market, honey?

27:16.836 --> 27:19.436
I'm figuring to leave
in about 10 minutes or so.

27:19.538 --> 27:21.005
All right.

27:21.107 --> 27:22.673
Gonna meet Rocky
and Foster there.

27:23.743 --> 27:25.142
You two wanna tag along?

27:25.244 --> 27:27.378
Tag along with Mr. Rocky
and Foster?

27:27.480 --> 27:29.013
No, thanks.

27:29.081 --> 27:30.414
Actually, I need the kids
to do me a favor.

27:30.516 --> 27:31.582
- Can you?
- Yeah, of course.

27:31.651 --> 27:33.450
Thanks, Jo Bear.

27:33.519 --> 27:35.319
I have a package at
the post office I'm expecting.

27:35.421 --> 27:37.621
- Can you pick it up for me?
- Yeah, we can do that.

27:37.690 --> 27:40.224
Yeah, then you could show
Jack the town a little bit.

27:40.326 --> 27:41.659
Give him a little tour.

27:41.761 --> 27:43.627
I can't wait, Jo Bear.

27:43.729 --> 27:44.862
Eat your pancakes.

27:52.138 --> 27:55.773
Across the street is the
best po' boy shop in the city.

27:55.841 --> 27:58.642
- And over here is like the 15th antique store.
- Ah.

27:58.711 --> 28:00.911
And then right in here
is my favorite coffee shop.

28:00.980 --> 28:02.379
I don't know if you're
into peppermint lattes,

28:02.448 --> 28:04.081
but they are pretty good.

28:05.484 --> 28:06.984
Um, I'm gonna need you

28:07.053 --> 28:08.285
to put your arm
around me, please.

28:08.354 --> 28:09.787
- What?
- Just do it. Be casual.

28:12.024 --> 28:13.691
What are you doing? Stop!

28:16.996 --> 28:18.228
What was that? That was casual?

28:18.330 --> 28:19.530
I'm sorry. I improvised.

28:19.598 --> 28:21.465
Well, warn a girl next time.

28:21.567 --> 28:23.067
- No, it's fine.
- Hey, yeah.

28:26.005 --> 28:28.038
I guess that's what
you were trying to avoid.

28:28.140 --> 28:29.907
Uh-huh, yeah.

28:30.009 --> 28:31.809
She's pretty, right?

28:31.877 --> 28:34.745
Yeah, but has she ever built
a computer from scratch

28:34.814 --> 28:37.881
out of only recycled materials?

28:37.983 --> 28:39.850
Oh, hold on.

28:41.487 --> 28:44.755
Oh, no!
Oh, the driver's gonna be late.

28:44.824 --> 28:48.392
The package isn't gonna get
here for like another hour.

28:48.461 --> 28:50.360
I guess we can go to the
market and we come back.

28:50.463 --> 28:51.862
Yeah.

28:51.964 --> 28:54.965
You know what, come with me.

29:04.543 --> 29:06.744
I can't believe you grew up
with this in your backyard.

29:06.812 --> 29:09.513
Oh, yeah. It's magical, right?

29:09.582 --> 29:11.815
I used to go running
on this trail.

29:13.452 --> 29:14.785
Yeah, it's nice,
but I gotta admit

29:14.887 --> 29:16.687
I miss the snow
back home in Oregon.

29:16.756 --> 29:19.022
Yeah, but does Oregon
have a Christmas smell?

29:19.125 --> 29:20.824
Hmm?

29:20.893 --> 29:22.593
Yeah, every year in December,
the farmers, uh,

29:22.661 --> 29:25.028
they burn the sugar cane
after the harvest.

29:25.097 --> 29:27.865
So these little flecks of ash
fall down from the sky

29:27.933 --> 29:30.100
and it smells like
a really sweet campfire.

29:30.202 --> 29:31.935
So you smell it,

29:32.004 --> 29:33.570
and you know that Christmas
is right around the corner.

29:33.639 --> 29:35.172
And ash literally
falls from the sky?

29:35.241 --> 29:36.340
Yeah, it's like Pompeii.

29:36.408 --> 29:38.242
- Oh!
- What?

29:38.344 --> 29:40.377
Would that be a crocodile?

29:40.446 --> 29:42.412
Um, we're not in Florida, so no.

29:42.515 --> 29:43.747
There are no crocodiles.

29:43.849 --> 29:45.349
Oh, OK.

29:45.451 --> 29:47.084
- Yeah.
- Let's have a look.

29:48.888 --> 29:50.721
I mean, it could be
an alligator.

29:50.823 --> 29:52.623
Are you serious?

29:52.725 --> 29:53.957
Pretty serious.

29:57.663 --> 29:59.229
You're hilarious.

30:03.769 --> 30:06.637
Would you look at him?
He's terrifying!

30:10.042 --> 30:11.608
You gonna be OK?

30:16.115 --> 30:17.648
You know,
when I tell people this story,

30:17.750 --> 30:18.849
I'm going to say
I bravely rescued you

30:18.951 --> 30:20.551
from a crocodile, right?

30:20.653 --> 30:22.119
It's an alligator.

30:29.762 --> 30:30.727
And then we can leave.

30:30.830 --> 30:31.829
OK.

30:38.804 --> 30:40.871
Hello.

30:40.940 --> 30:42.673
<i>Jack, my romantic
man, how's it going?</i>

30:42.775 --> 30:44.174
Good, good.

30:44.276 --> 30:46.343
Wonderful!
How far along are you?

30:46.412 --> 30:49.713
Ah, well, technically,
I haven't started writing yet.

30:49.815 --> 30:51.481
<i>What have you been doing?</i>

30:51.550 --> 30:53.083
I finished reading
<i>Romance in the Valley.</i>

30:53.152 --> 30:54.017
That was awful.

30:58.524 --> 31:00.290
Hello.

31:00.359 --> 31:01.925
<i>Hey, lady. Just
called to check in.</i>

31:01.994 --> 31:03.594
How's everything going?
Getting any better?

31:03.696 --> 31:05.662
Yeah, so far so good.

31:05.731 --> 31:07.030
How's my big flaky brother?

31:07.099 --> 31:09.099
He's actually not bad.

31:09.201 --> 31:11.635
It turns out the buffer
is working, so.

31:11.737 --> 31:13.303
<i>He's a pretty good distraction.</i>

31:13.405 --> 31:14.805
Nice distraction, huh?

31:14.907 --> 31:16.206
Look, Devon, I'm sorry.

31:16.308 --> 31:17.908
I've just been
a little distracted,

31:17.977 --> 31:19.376
and to be honest,
that outline isn't helping any.

31:19.445 --> 31:21.278
I'm just… I'm not inspired.

31:21.347 --> 31:23.080
Why don't you just
do some of the things

31:23.182 --> 31:24.047
in the outline?

31:24.149 --> 31:25.749
Like what?

31:25.818 --> 31:27.351
<i>Give me something
from the paper.</i>

31:32.091 --> 31:34.791
Uh… flee from danger.

31:34.860 --> 31:36.126
Dance under the stars.

31:36.228 --> 31:37.961
Perfect! Find a date,

31:38.030 --> 31:40.497
take her dancing
under the stars.

31:40.566 --> 31:42.132
Yeah, I can't just find a date.

31:42.201 --> 31:43.800
I'm in Louisiana with
my sister's best friend.

31:43.903 --> 31:45.469
<i>You're in Louisiana?</i>

31:45.571 --> 31:46.436
Yeah.

31:46.538 --> 31:47.671
With a girl.

31:47.740 --> 31:49.373
Uh-huh.

31:49.441 --> 31:52.342
You can literally
live out the plot of this book.

31:52.411 --> 31:54.745
<i>Write what you know. Isn't
that what they always say?</i>

31:54.813 --> 31:59.316
<i>Ah, you creative types
make my life so hard.</i>

31:59.385 --> 32:03.053
<i>I really need to see
some pages soon.</i>

32:03.122 --> 32:05.455
Yep. All good. I'm on it.

32:09.128 --> 32:10.761
- You ready?
- Yeah, you betcha.

32:53.372 --> 32:55.706
Dust off Old St. Nick, there.

32:55.774 --> 32:58.075
This is my favorite part.
A lollipop there,

32:58.143 --> 33:00.410
and a lollipop there.

33:00.512 --> 33:03.313
Aw man, it's just warms
the heart, don't it?

33:03.382 --> 33:04.614
Ho-ho-ho!

33:08.187 --> 33:09.553
Little bit more.

33:09.621 --> 33:10.520
- Hey!
- That's good.

33:10.589 --> 33:11.855
Hey!

33:11.924 --> 33:12.956
Hey.

33:14.159 --> 33:15.459
Hey.

33:16.328 --> 33:17.828
Oh, Jolie!

33:17.896 --> 33:19.596
Oh, Miss Meredith!
Hi, how are you?

33:19.698 --> 33:20.564
I'm good.

33:20.666 --> 33:22.366
Thank you, Jack.

33:22.434 --> 33:24.167
- Good to see you.
- It's so good to see you!

33:24.269 --> 33:26.737
And is this the handsome writer

33:26.839 --> 33:28.638
that we've been gossiping
about all morning?

33:28.707 --> 33:31.241
Um, this is Jack, my boyfriend.

33:31.343 --> 33:32.776
My boyfriend Jack.

33:32.845 --> 33:35.078
Oh, around these parts we hug.

33:35.180 --> 33:36.113
Boyfriend Jack.

33:36.215 --> 33:37.214
Yeah.

33:37.282 --> 33:39.316
Nice to meet you, too.

33:39.418 --> 33:40.584
Will you all come
see what we've done?

33:40.686 --> 33:42.853
Yeah, it looks pretty.

34:02.408 --> 34:04.441
Wait, so this is it?
Just this?

34:04.510 --> 34:07.144
Yeah!
It's really nice, isn't it?

34:07.246 --> 34:09.679
Yeah, yeah. For sure.

34:09.748 --> 34:12.049
I mean, it kinda
looks like Christmas

34:12.117 --> 34:15.452
just threw up all over
this quaint little market,

34:15.554 --> 34:17.521
but it's, you know…

34:18.757 --> 34:20.257
You know, I know it's a lot,

34:20.359 --> 34:22.059
but this is the fun part,
you know.

34:22.127 --> 34:24.661
And this isn't even the point.
This is just…

34:24.763 --> 34:27.797
Definitely.
I mean, subtlety is overrated,

34:27.866 --> 34:30.934
and, um, taste
is really subjective.

34:31.036 --> 34:32.735
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I guess.

34:32.838 --> 34:34.771
Hey, let me show you
these ducks I saw earlier.

34:35.940 --> 34:37.507
Don't listen to her.

34:37.576 --> 34:39.775
The place looks incredible.

34:39.878 --> 34:41.745
Your family's done
an awesome job.

34:42.848 --> 34:44.313
Thank you.

34:44.416 --> 34:45.849
Hey, Jolie?

34:45.918 --> 34:46.817
Yes, sir.

34:46.918 --> 34:47.951
You ready?

34:48.053 --> 34:49.186
Uh-huh.

34:49.288 --> 34:51.420
Luc, Breonna, it's time.

34:51.489 --> 34:54.524
Daddy, I know
it is not Christmas yet,

34:54.592 --> 34:56.560
but I have a surprise for you.

34:56.628 --> 34:58.962
So, I have to give you your
Christmas present early, OK?

34:59.064 --> 34:59.963
What?

35:01.667 --> 35:03.233
This year,
for your Christmas present,

35:03.302 --> 35:06.002
I worked with Mr. Rocky
and the city council

35:06.071 --> 35:08.705
to create for you,
not only a brand-new

35:08.774 --> 35:11.641
state-of-the-art website
for the Christmas Market

35:11.710 --> 35:14.511
but an interactive app for all
the locals and tourists alike.

35:14.580 --> 35:16.346
Man, check this out, Mr. Tim.

35:16.448 --> 35:17.747
- Oh!
- Sweetheart!

35:17.850 --> 35:19.282
OK, so if you look
at this on here,

35:19.384 --> 35:21.184
you can find
your favorite vendors

35:21.253 --> 35:23.720
and then you can pay for
merchandise and products,

35:23.755 --> 35:26.389
and you can also find out what time
all your favorite bands are playing.

35:26.492 --> 35:28.391
Oh, and you were in on this?

35:28.460 --> 35:31.795
I never ruin a Christmas
secret there, T-Tim.

35:31.897 --> 35:33.130
You know that, huh?

35:34.800 --> 35:36.466
Here, here,
show him the brochure.

35:36.535 --> 35:39.236
OK, so Mr. Rocky and I
have been publicizing

35:39.304 --> 35:42.372
the website and the app,
and we already have doubled

35:42.441 --> 35:44.141
the estimated number
of downloads.

35:44.209 --> 35:48.245
So it looks like it's gonna
be the biggest year yet.

35:48.313 --> 35:50.847
Jo-Jo, this is just…
I don't believe it.

35:50.916 --> 35:52.382
It's amazing. I really don't.

35:52.451 --> 35:54.384
Oh, Merry Christmas, Daddy.

35:54.486 --> 35:56.853
And congrats on 30 years
of the market!

35:56.955 --> 35:58.421
Yeah.

35:58.524 --> 36:01.558
- Thank you, buddy.
- Yeah.

36:22.381 --> 36:23.780
Hey.

36:24.650 --> 36:25.615
Hey.

36:27.119 --> 36:29.286
I'm just getting
a jump on stuff.

36:29.388 --> 36:30.954
Nice, right?

36:31.056 --> 36:32.489
It's beautiful.

36:32.558 --> 36:33.823
It's all Mom.

36:36.929 --> 36:38.195
This one you?

36:39.398 --> 36:41.064
Yeah.

36:41.133 --> 36:43.767
Yeah, that's me,
and then here's Breonna.

36:47.806 --> 36:50.006
Hey, what's the story
with this one?

36:53.178 --> 36:55.679
Um, my mom had breast
cancer a few years ago.

36:55.781 --> 36:56.980
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know.

36:57.082 --> 36:58.982
It's OK. It's fine.

36:59.084 --> 37:00.550
She's a strong lady.

37:00.619 --> 37:02.052
Is she OK now?

37:02.120 --> 37:04.354
She's in remission, um,

37:04.456 --> 37:05.689
but she's supposed
to get check-ups

37:05.791 --> 37:07.224
which can be stressful.

37:08.994 --> 37:10.860
Yeah. Sounds like a lot.

37:10.963 --> 37:13.830
It is.

37:13.899 --> 37:15.765
Anyway, I moved back home
when she got sick

37:15.867 --> 37:17.834
and I don't know
if you remember,

37:17.903 --> 37:19.069
but that's back when
I was living with Naomi,

37:19.137 --> 37:22.572
and I just left and I came here

37:22.641 --> 37:25.342
because I felt like
it's where I needed to be.

37:25.410 --> 37:28.912
And then Foster was actually
my high school boyfriend,

37:28.981 --> 37:30.880
and he was really
wonderful with my family

37:30.949 --> 37:34.084
during the whole situation,
and so we got back together.

37:35.621 --> 37:36.987
There's a lot of history there.

37:37.089 --> 37:38.955
Yes. You could say that.

37:40.092 --> 37:42.158
Yes. That's the past.

37:43.729 --> 37:46.129
Hey, you don't want any
hot chocolate, do you?

37:48.533 --> 37:50.634
Yeah, sounds nice.

37:50.702 --> 37:53.336
Do you mind if I ask
why you two broke up?

37:53.438 --> 37:55.205
Wow!

37:55.307 --> 37:59.876
Uh, well, Foster thought
we wanted different things.

37:59.945 --> 38:01.478
And I thought he was wrong.

38:03.248 --> 38:04.614
You know, I thought it
was one of those things

38:04.716 --> 38:05.882
that you say when you break up,

38:05.984 --> 38:07.951
"Oh no, it's not you, it's me."

38:08.020 --> 38:09.886
But now that a little bit
of time has passed,

38:09.955 --> 38:12.355
I think he was probably right.

38:12.424 --> 38:15.058
You know, it's possible
to really care about somebody

38:15.127 --> 38:16.459
and not be compatible.

38:17.562 --> 38:18.828
You still love him?

38:21.533 --> 38:22.766
I don't know.

38:22.868 --> 38:25.302
I hope not.

38:25.370 --> 38:26.536
That's an honest answer.

38:26.605 --> 38:28.538
Yeah. Pretty invasive question.

38:35.714 --> 38:39.549
It's not lost on me that you
are a really good listener.

38:40.686 --> 38:42.952
Oh, thanks.

38:43.021 --> 38:46.856
It turns out that, um, you are
pretty interesting to listen to.

38:48.393 --> 38:49.659
What's your story?

38:51.663 --> 38:53.096
How much hot chocolate you got?

38:53.165 --> 38:56.099
Tons!

38:56.168 --> 38:58.168
Really, what's your deal,
Mr. Romance?

38:58.236 --> 39:01.871
You have like lots of damsels
in distress that you've saved?

39:01.973 --> 39:04.374
Uh, no.

39:04.443 --> 39:07.544
Actually there's not a whole
lot to write home about.

39:10.415 --> 39:12.282
I'm not buying it.

39:12.384 --> 39:14.117
- No?
- Mm-mmm.

39:18.724 --> 39:19.989
Wanna play some cards?

39:20.058 --> 39:21.524
- Nice segue.
- Mm-hmm.

39:21.593 --> 39:23.626
Yeah, I'll play you in cards.

39:23.729 --> 39:25.195
Rummy.

39:25.263 --> 39:27.864
When I win,
you'll tell me stories.

39:29.368 --> 39:31.501
OK. And when I win…

39:31.603 --> 39:32.569
You won't.

39:34.473 --> 39:36.339
Where's your mom at?

39:36.441 --> 39:38.375
Speaking of moms,
what's your mom's story?

39:38.443 --> 39:40.910
She seems… she seems…

40:12.978 --> 40:15.445
You're gonna need some help.

40:15.547 --> 40:16.780
Merry Christmas, everybody.

40:16.882 --> 40:17.947
Thank you.

40:39.438 --> 40:40.303
Hey, guys!

40:40.405 --> 40:42.739
Santa!

40:42.808 --> 40:44.340
Next.

40:44.409 --> 40:45.875
Come on up. Merry Christmas.

40:45.944 --> 40:48.878
Ho-ho-ho. Merry Christmas!

40:48.947 --> 40:51.247
So, what can I bring you
for Christmas this year?

40:51.316 --> 40:52.982
Uh, a doll.

40:53.084 --> 40:54.250
A doll. Okey-dokey.

40:54.352 --> 40:55.919
We have plenty of them

40:55.987 --> 40:56.986
up at the North Pole,
don't you know.

40:57.088 --> 40:58.421
Merry Christmas!

40:58.490 --> 41:00.323
- OK.
- Next.

41:00.425 --> 41:02.592
The shack up here
with all of the animals

41:02.661 --> 41:04.027
is where we have
the gumbo cookoff.

41:04.129 --> 41:05.695
Naturally.

41:05.764 --> 41:07.163
And back there,
the pavilion is where

41:07.265 --> 41:08.832
Tyler Hilton
is playing tomorrow.

41:10.368 --> 41:12.335
What's that?

41:12.404 --> 41:13.803
That's the jam booth.

41:13.905 --> 41:15.405
The jam booth?

41:40.332 --> 41:41.931
- Jolie!
- How you doin', Bud?

41:42.000 --> 41:43.199
Why don't you play somethin'?

41:43.268 --> 41:45.034
No, no, no.

41:45.103 --> 41:48.872
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Jolie, play something for us.

41:48.940 --> 41:51.641
Yeah. All right.
I'll give you one.

41:51.710 --> 41:52.775
- Can I borrow this?
- Yeah.

41:52.844 --> 41:54.210
Thank you, sir. OK.

41:55.480 --> 41:56.946
Count me in.

42:03.154 --> 42:04.420
All right.

42:12.831 --> 42:13.863
Get it, Jolie!

42:25.744 --> 42:26.709
Ah…

42:28.246 --> 42:29.345
Hey, thanks!

42:29.414 --> 42:30.613
Wow!

42:30.715 --> 42:31.915
That's fun!

42:32.017 --> 42:34.150
I'll see you guys around.

42:34.252 --> 42:35.485
Have fun.

42:36.555 --> 42:37.654
What was that?

42:37.722 --> 42:39.556
That was nothing.

42:39.624 --> 42:40.890
Well, I had zero idea
that you played the fiddle.

42:40.959 --> 42:42.892
I don't play the fiddle,

42:42.961 --> 42:45.528
but I did learn a thing or two
from my father as a child.

42:45.630 --> 42:46.663
Well, that's just impressive.

42:46.765 --> 42:48.665
Thank you, very much.

42:48.733 --> 42:50.633
Speaking of impressive,
over there is the very famous

42:50.702 --> 42:53.136
Christmas tree maze
invented by yours truly.

42:53.204 --> 42:54.871
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

42:54.940 --> 42:56.139
The Christmas Market
used to just be shops

42:56.207 --> 42:58.007
and arts and crafts over there,

42:58.076 --> 43:00.109
but over the years,
we added fun stuff like this.

43:00.211 --> 43:01.678
And it was your brainchild?

43:01.746 --> 43:04.047
Sure was.
You feelin' adventurous?

43:05.016 --> 43:06.683
Yeah.

43:06.785 --> 43:07.917
Race ya!

43:14.859 --> 43:16.726
This way. Hold on.

43:23.501 --> 43:25.401
Ooh, left or right?

43:28.707 --> 43:30.406
- I'm thinking right.
- Probably left.

43:30.475 --> 43:32.609
Friendly wager?
Whoever gets out first wins?

43:34.012 --> 43:35.178
You're on.

43:39.250 --> 43:40.350
Hey, Jo.

43:40.452 --> 43:42.118
Hi. Hey.

43:42.220 --> 43:43.753
Hey.

43:43.822 --> 43:45.588
Uh, um, I've just been
meaning to talk to you.

43:45.690 --> 43:46.723
I, uh…

43:48.793 --> 43:49.892
I miss you.

43:51.997 --> 43:53.730
Foster, you have a girlfriend.

43:53.798 --> 43:55.665
Yeah, I, I know, I know.

43:55.734 --> 43:57.967
I was just hoping we can
get some coffee if you're free.

43:58.036 --> 43:59.802
Just, just coffee.

43:59.871 --> 44:01.704
I just miss talkin' to you
every day, that's all.

44:01.806 --> 44:03.940
All right, but that's what
happens when you break up.

44:04.009 --> 44:07.477
You don't get to talk to
the person every day anymore.

44:09.214 --> 44:10.413
Yeah, I know.

44:12.350 --> 44:13.916
I was just hopin', I guess,
that there's a part of you

44:13.985 --> 44:16.085
that just missed me,
just a little bit.

44:17.222 --> 44:18.688
Come on. It's my treat.

44:18.790 --> 44:20.723
Peppermint lattes.
Like old times.

44:20.792 --> 44:25.528
But you have an Amy
and I have a Jack.

44:26.831 --> 44:27.797
Come on, Jo-Jo.

44:27.866 --> 44:30.066
Don't call me that. OK?

44:31.936 --> 44:32.969
Wha…

44:41.579 --> 44:42.879
It took you long enough.

44:42.947 --> 44:45.281
Huh, sorry. I got distracted.

44:45.383 --> 44:47.016
That's all good.
I got you cider.

44:50.188 --> 44:53.456
Mmm, that's hot. What?

44:56.528 --> 44:57.694
I'm happy you're here.

45:00.899 --> 45:02.198
Come on.

45:05.270 --> 45:07.804
Well, Maxie's out like a light.

45:07.906 --> 45:09.305
Really? It's early.

45:09.407 --> 45:11.107
Maybe it's because
of all the cookies

45:11.176 --> 45:12.942
that somebody was
sneaking to her earlier.

45:13.044 --> 45:14.277
Ha ha.

45:14.345 --> 45:16.012
Don't think we didn't notice.

45:16.114 --> 45:17.480
It's Christmas!
Let her have the cookies.

45:17.582 --> 45:18.715
Uh, it's tradition.

45:18.817 --> 45:20.550
Can't mess with tradition.

45:20.652 --> 45:23.319
OK. Well, she's crashed
now from all that sugar,

45:23.421 --> 45:25.154
but when she wakes up
at 4:00 a.m.,

45:25.223 --> 45:27.423
I am callin' her Memaw
to come hang out with her.

45:27.525 --> 45:29.258
All right, all right!

45:29.327 --> 45:31.861
Let the punishment
fit the crime.

45:34.733 --> 45:36.199
So, what did you think
of the market today?

45:36.267 --> 45:38.000
I thought it was great.

45:38.069 --> 45:39.869
Yeah, the town has
a lot of cool history to it.

45:39.938 --> 45:42.705
And you guys have a lot
of interesting traditions.

45:42.774 --> 45:44.474
Yeah, the first Christmas
I spent with these guys,

45:44.576 --> 45:46.175
I couldn't believe how many
traditions they have here.

45:46.244 --> 45:47.410
Well, you brought
some of your own.

45:47.479 --> 45:49.645
That's right.

45:49.714 --> 45:52.048
We bake gingerbread houses now,
just like when he was a kid.

45:52.150 --> 45:53.349
Every year.

45:53.418 --> 45:54.684
And it was a great addition.

45:55.754 --> 45:57.520
So, Jack,

45:57.589 --> 45:59.889
does your family have
any Christmas traditions?

45:59.991 --> 46:02.625
None quite as extensive,

46:02.694 --> 46:06.362
uh, but we do play this fun game
every year, Christmas Fishbowl.

46:06.431 --> 46:08.431
- Fishbowl?
- It's basically like charades

46:08.500 --> 46:09.499
but with a few added challenges.

46:09.601 --> 46:11.267
Oh, you wanna teach us?

46:11.336 --> 46:12.401
Yeah, let's play!

46:12.504 --> 46:13.503
Let's play it!

46:13.605 --> 46:14.771
Yeah, we like games.

46:14.873 --> 46:15.905
OK. Sure.

46:16.007 --> 46:17.039
Great!

46:18.777 --> 46:20.209
All right. Fishbowl.
We have three rounds.

46:20.278 --> 46:21.511
First round is like catchphrase.

46:21.579 --> 46:23.312
Second round is like charades,

46:23.381 --> 46:24.981
and the third round,
you can only use one word

46:25.083 --> 46:26.749
to describe
what's on the piece of paper.

46:26.818 --> 46:28.384
And we'll reuse
all the same pieces of paper

46:28.453 --> 46:29.986
for all three rounds.

46:33.057 --> 46:34.690
Uh, we'll figure it out
as we play.

46:34.793 --> 46:37.693
I'll go first, OK?
Got the timer?

46:37.796 --> 46:39.695
Ready and… go!

46:39.798 --> 46:41.264
OK.

46:41.332 --> 46:43.199
Um, all right.
I'm mean and green.

46:43.301 --> 46:45.168
Grinch!

46:45.236 --> 46:48.004
Yes, and now this happened
to a specific part of my body.

46:50.008 --> 46:51.808
Well, uh, heart, heart!

46:51.910 --> 46:54.277
The Grinch's small heart
grew three sizes that day.

46:54.379 --> 46:55.511
Yes, yeah!

46:55.613 --> 46:56.579
I already got one!

46:56.681 --> 46:57.847
Good one!

46:57.916 --> 46:59.282
- Uhh.
- Impressive.

46:59.350 --> 47:02.151
All right.
I'm uh, Santa's helper.

47:02.220 --> 47:04.253
- An elf.
- Yes, but I'm a recent thing

47:04.355 --> 47:05.655
that families have
in their home.

47:05.757 --> 47:06.789
- Uh, Elf on a Shelf.
- Yes!

47:06.891 --> 47:08.090
- Time.
- Good work, Dad.

47:08.193 --> 47:09.225
Nice!

47:09.294 --> 47:10.827
Time, time, time.

47:10.929 --> 47:11.928
Well. All right.

47:11.996 --> 47:12.995
Luc's up.

47:17.001 --> 47:18.501
OK. Kermit.

47:18.603 --> 47:19.735
Oh, oh.

47:19.838 --> 47:21.003
The Muppets, A Christmas Carol.

47:21.105 --> 47:23.072
Yes! OK. All right.

47:23.141 --> 47:24.106
Nice, nice!

47:24.209 --> 47:25.908
Ohh.

47:25.944 --> 47:27.243
Hey, he's cheating.
How did he get that? Huh?

47:27.312 --> 47:30.413
OK, OK. Um…

47:30.515 --> 47:33.015
Uh, aortic?

47:33.084 --> 47:34.617
What? Aortic?

47:34.719 --> 47:35.952
Yeah.

47:36.054 --> 47:37.720
Aortic?

47:37.822 --> 47:39.522
15 seconds.

47:39.624 --> 47:41.724
Aortic. Which ones we have left?

47:42.627 --> 47:43.526
10 seconds.

47:44.696 --> 47:46.596
Come on, come on.

47:46.698 --> 47:48.364
Oh! And the Grinch's small
heart grew two sizes that day!

47:48.433 --> 47:50.833
Oh, yes, yes!

47:50.935 --> 47:52.568
I was gonna say Whoville,
but I thought you would think

47:52.637 --> 47:54.136
it was the Cindy Lulu
thing from earlier.

47:54.205 --> 47:55.538
No, that was a really good clue.

47:55.607 --> 47:56.505
- It was?
- Yes!

47:56.608 --> 47:57.473
OK. OK.

48:00.078 --> 48:03.179
Ah, good one, good one.
Thank you for teaching us.

48:03.281 --> 48:05.181
A great game, Jack. Great game.

48:05.250 --> 48:06.983
- That was real fun.
- It <i> was</i> fun.

48:35.413 --> 48:36.379
Come in.

48:38.783 --> 48:39.715
Hi.

48:39.817 --> 48:41.350
Hey.

48:41.452 --> 48:43.052
I just wanna say good night.

48:44.322 --> 48:45.888
Good night.

48:47.725 --> 48:49.225
Thanks for doing this.

48:49.294 --> 48:51.694
I really do appreciate it.

48:51.763 --> 48:54.630
Of course. A deal's a deal.

48:56.434 --> 48:58.367
OK. Good night.

49:07.512 --> 49:08.978
I'm about to tell ya

49:09.047 --> 49:11.414
the Cajun
<i>Night Before Christmas</i>.

49:11.482 --> 49:13.349
"Twas the night before Christmas

49:13.418 --> 49:16.452
and all through the house,
they don't let things pass

49:16.554 --> 49:18.754
not even the mouse.

49:18.823 --> 49:22.358
The children be nestled
good snug on the floor

49:22.427 --> 49:26.429
and Momma passed a paper
through a crack in the door

49:28.433 --> 49:32.601
their momma in the fireplace
there roasted up the ham

49:32.670 --> 49:37.473
stirred up the gumbo
and made baked the yams…"

49:37.542 --> 49:39.742
Well, Jolie Bear, I believe
we've got everything covered.

49:39.844 --> 49:41.644
Yeah.

49:41.713 --> 49:43.312
Why don't you go get
yourself some fun, too, huh?

49:43.414 --> 49:44.714
Where's Jack?

49:44.816 --> 49:46.182
- He's with Momma.
- Mm-hmm.

49:46.284 --> 49:47.149
You sure you don't
need anything else?

49:47.251 --> 49:49.318
Oh, I'm sure.

49:49.387 --> 49:52.421
You're, uh, officially relieved
of your volunteer duties.

49:52.490 --> 49:54.323
It looks really pretty, Daddy.

49:54.425 --> 49:55.624
Yeah.

49:55.727 --> 49:57.493
Another year, another success.

49:57.562 --> 49:58.728
Yeah.

49:58.830 --> 49:59.962
So you grew up in Oregon.

50:00.064 --> 50:02.231
Yep. Born and raised in Eugene.

50:02.300 --> 50:03.699
Well, we know Naomi, of course,

50:03.768 --> 50:05.234
but do you have other siblings?

50:05.336 --> 50:06.569
No, just the two of us.

50:06.637 --> 50:08.104
- So, you're the oldest.
- I am.

50:08.172 --> 50:09.672
How long have your folks
been married?

50:09.774 --> 50:11.540
Pardon me, ladies.

50:11.609 --> 50:13.809
May I borrow the very handsome
writer for a moment?

50:13.878 --> 50:16.078
You know, that nickname's
really starting to grow on me.

50:18.082 --> 50:19.782
Now don't forget to give
us your parents' address.

50:19.884 --> 50:21.417
Oh, right.
We want to personalize

50:21.486 --> 50:23.052
some of our nicest
ornaments for them.

50:23.121 --> 50:24.220
Oh, yes, ma'am.

50:24.288 --> 50:25.321
Bye.

50:25.423 --> 50:28.324
- Bye.
- Bye.

50:28.426 --> 50:30.393
- See ya.
- How was that?

50:30.461 --> 50:32.361
It was good. They just
asked all sorts of questions

50:32.463 --> 50:33.863
about my job and family.

50:33.965 --> 50:35.064
Yeah, they were grilling you.

50:35.166 --> 50:37.099
Yeah, but with gifts.

50:37.168 --> 50:38.434
The Southern way.

50:40.371 --> 50:41.504
Hey, Merry Christmas.

50:41.572 --> 50:43.172
Oh, Merry Christmas.

50:43.241 --> 50:44.673
It's gonna be fun!
You're gonna love it.

50:44.776 --> 50:45.975
I'm hungry.

50:46.077 --> 50:47.476
Oh, why don't you take a break

50:47.578 --> 50:49.045
and go get some gumbo?

50:49.147 --> 50:50.846
Did you say it was vegan?

50:53.651 --> 50:54.884
Oh, no, no.

50:54.986 --> 50:56.786
I thought you were kidding.

50:56.854 --> 50:58.454
No, it's… it's definitely,
definitely not vegan.

50:58.523 --> 51:00.923
I can't wait to get back home.

51:03.661 --> 51:05.761
<i>Joyeux Noel.</i>

51:05.830 --> 51:09.131
This year's Golden
Gumbo Pot goes to…

51:09.200 --> 51:12.635
Luc Doucette for the second
time in a row, don't ya know.

51:15.073 --> 51:17.339
- Wow, Luc won!
- Yeah, he did.

51:17.442 --> 51:19.175
Daddy taught him
the Guidry family recipe,

51:19.243 --> 51:20.943
which is clearly a fan favorite.

51:21.045 --> 51:21.944
You want some?

51:22.013 --> 51:22.912
Yeah.

51:23.014 --> 51:24.780
Thank you.

51:24.849 --> 51:26.182
Can you handle spicy?

51:26.250 --> 51:27.817
Ha! Can I handle spicy!

51:27.885 --> 51:29.785
This doesn't look like much.

51:33.758 --> 51:36.325
Oh! Oh, my God,
that's like lava.

51:36.427 --> 51:37.326
You'll be OK.

51:37.395 --> 51:38.861
Oh!

51:38.930 --> 51:40.596
- Good job, Luc.
- Thank you very much.

51:40.665 --> 51:41.797
You're not allowed
to drink milk with that.

51:41.866 --> 51:42.998
You gotta keep the hot.

51:48.206 --> 51:49.605
Hey, let me ask you something.

51:49.707 --> 51:51.240
Shoot.

51:51.309 --> 51:53.709
- When we get back to New York.
- Mm-hmm.

51:53.811 --> 51:55.244
You know, after the holidays,

51:55.346 --> 51:57.113
once everything's settled down.

51:57.181 --> 51:59.014
Um…

52:03.054 --> 52:04.487
will you…

52:07.258 --> 52:08.757
will you, uh…

52:10.962 --> 52:13.629
will you teach me
how to make this gumbo?

52:16.000 --> 52:17.566
Yeah, of course I will.

52:23.274 --> 52:24.473
How's everybody doing?

52:29.881 --> 52:32.715
This is the 30th year that we've
had this Christmas Market.

52:32.817 --> 52:34.283
I'd like to bring out

52:34.385 --> 52:36.185
the two people
responsible for this,

52:36.287 --> 52:38.654
Tim Guidry, Rocky Broussard.

52:45.196 --> 52:48.564
For your hard work and
dedication to our city,

52:48.633 --> 52:51.800
I'd like for each of you
to receive a key to the city.

53:03.114 --> 53:05.447
Thank you, Mayor Robideaux.

53:05.516 --> 53:08.684
And we just wanna thank
our amazing volunteers, yeah,

53:08.753 --> 53:10.553
and let's give them
a round of applause.

53:10.655 --> 53:12.588
What you say?

53:12.690 --> 53:14.957
<i>Merci beaucoup!</i>

53:15.059 --> 53:16.425
<i>Merci beaucoup!</i>

53:18.829 --> 53:19.962
All right, Dad!

53:21.399 --> 53:22.998
I just want to take a moment

53:23.067 --> 53:26.202
to thank my beautiful
wife and daughters

53:26.270 --> 53:28.604
for all their hard work
on this market.

53:28.706 --> 53:30.306
I love you.

53:30.408 --> 53:32.541
So now, ladies and gentlemen,

53:32.610 --> 53:35.778

56:10.868 --> 56:12.167

Me too.

56:16.006 --> 56:18.107
And your family's
been great to me.

56:18.209 --> 56:20.142
Well, they like you all right.

56:20.211 --> 56:21.810
Even Breonna's come around.

56:26.384 --> 56:28.384
It's weird.

56:28.452 --> 56:31.487
I feel like I've known
about you for a real long time,

56:31.555 --> 56:33.622
but then I get here,
and I realize,

56:33.724 --> 56:35.691
I didn't know
the first thing about you.

56:37.128 --> 56:38.627
Same.

56:39.864 --> 56:41.563
I'm sorry, by the way.

56:41.665 --> 56:43.699
Why are you sorry?

56:43.768 --> 56:44.900
I bailed on our date.

56:44.969 --> 56:46.468
Oh, stop, Jack!

56:46.537 --> 56:48.604
No, look…

56:48.672 --> 56:52.274
Jolie, I remember you
and Foster at the wedding.

56:54.044 --> 56:57.713
You know, I'm not some
super successful guy.

56:57.782 --> 57:01.283
I live in a five-story
walk-up with three roommates.

57:01.385 --> 57:03.185
That's cool.

57:03.254 --> 57:06.054
No, it's, it's not what
I'm getting at, it's like…

57:06.123 --> 57:10.259
I bailed, because
I felt like, you know,

57:10.327 --> 57:13.328
maybe I wasn't
good enough for you.

57:14.665 --> 57:17.299
You know, and now, we're here,

57:17.368 --> 57:22.805
and I feel like I missed
a really amazing opportunity.

57:25.943 --> 57:28.644
Maybe this is how it was
always supposed to go.

57:30.948 --> 57:32.214
I hope so.

58:05.316 --> 58:07.249
Magical time abilities?

58:07.318 --> 58:09.151
Yeah, how he can go around
the whole world in one night?

58:09.220 --> 58:10.385
Oh, sure.

58:10.488 --> 58:14.857
Or get to keep a reindeer?

58:14.925 --> 58:16.425
I mean, it depends
on the reindeer.

58:16.494 --> 58:17.993
- Really?
- No!

58:18.062 --> 58:19.895
Magical time abilities.

58:19.964 --> 58:21.330
I'm not going to take
some poor little reindeer

58:21.432 --> 58:22.764
away from his family.

58:22.867 --> 58:24.299
Yeah, it's a good answer.

58:24.401 --> 58:26.034
Give me a tougher one.

58:26.103 --> 58:27.102
OK.

58:30.241 --> 58:32.407
Would you rather spend Christmas

58:32.510 --> 58:35.344
with your best friend's brother

58:35.412 --> 58:39.781
or with one of Santa's elves,
but not just any old elf?

58:39.884 --> 58:43.085
The most handsome elf
in the entire workshop?

58:43.153 --> 58:44.052
That guy?

58:44.154 --> 58:45.020
Him!

58:45.122 --> 58:47.055
Ooh.

58:48.893 --> 58:50.759
Handsome's overrated.

58:58.602 --> 59:00.769
My family is spying on us.

59:00.871 --> 59:02.804
I think they're ready to go.

59:05.109 --> 59:06.341
What?

59:06.443 --> 59:08.110
Nothing.

59:08.178 --> 59:11.413
We should, uh, we should
go catch up with them.

59:26.463 --> 59:28.130
Oh, honey, are you
coming to bed?

59:28.198 --> 59:29.998
I'll be in a minute, darlin'.

59:30.100 --> 59:31.833
Let me get a couple
of boxes outta here.

59:31.936 --> 59:36.038
Jack, give me a hand, will you?

59:36.140 --> 59:38.340
Yes, sir.

59:38.409 --> 59:39.908
Sweetheart, come
sit down for a second.

59:40.010 --> 59:41.743
What is it?

59:41.812 --> 59:43.812
There's something I want
to tell you. I wanna…

59:43.881 --> 59:46.582
So, you know that I've been
in remission for five years.

59:46.684 --> 59:47.916
Yeah.

59:47.985 --> 59:49.851
Dr. Lewis called and he said

59:49.954 --> 59:54.122
that I am technically
and officially…

59:54.224 --> 59:55.591
cancer-free.

59:55.693 --> 59:56.625
Really?

59:56.727 --> 59:58.026
Like really?

59:58.128 --> 01:00:00.629
- Really!
- Momma! Oh, my God!

01:00:00.698 --> 01:00:04.199
This is like
the best present ever.

01:00:04.268 --> 01:00:06.468
Merry Christmas, Momma.

01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:10.038
Merry Christmas, sweet girl.

01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:14.276
I can see that, uh,
you make Jolie very happy.

01:00:14.378 --> 01:00:16.545
Thank you.

01:00:16.647 --> 01:00:19.915
And I, I think you're pretty
brave comin' here.

01:00:20.017 --> 01:00:21.350
See, um…

01:00:24.855 --> 01:00:27.823
Foster and Jolie
have a long history.

01:00:28.926 --> 01:00:30.192
I like him very much.

01:00:32.062 --> 01:00:36.031
But he's never looked
at her quite like you do.

01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:38.967
She's special.

01:00:40.170 --> 01:00:41.503
I have a feelin' that…

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:45.774
well, you'll let her shine.

01:00:47.311 --> 01:00:48.844
Thanks.

01:00:48.946 --> 01:00:50.345
Hm.

01:01:18.008 --> 01:01:20.175
Dance under the stars.

01:01:47.771 --> 01:01:49.104
Hey.

01:01:49.206 --> 01:01:50.572
You got my text.

01:01:50.674 --> 01:01:52.374
I did.

01:01:52.443 --> 01:01:53.975
What you got there?

01:01:54.044 --> 01:01:55.911
A little something for you.

01:01:57.147 --> 01:01:59.347
Did you make me a present?

01:01:59.450 --> 01:02:00.582
I did.

01:02:02.252 --> 01:02:04.653
What, are these pages
from your journal?

01:02:04.755 --> 01:02:05.854
They are.

01:02:05.956 --> 01:02:07.089
Good eye.

01:02:08.959 --> 01:02:10.659
When you're rich and famous,

01:02:10.728 --> 01:02:12.594
this will be worth
so much money.

01:02:12.696 --> 01:02:14.496
Oh, yeah.

01:02:14.565 --> 01:02:16.398
You're going to be able
to retire on that flower.

01:02:18.669 --> 01:02:20.669
What did you want to talk about?

01:02:22.606 --> 01:02:24.706
Just wanted to see
how you're doing.

01:02:26.376 --> 01:02:28.243
How you thought
all of this was going.

01:02:28.345 --> 01:02:29.377
Just checkin' in.

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:31.446
Just checkin' in, huh?

01:02:31.515 --> 01:02:34.716
Yeah. I don't know.

01:02:34.818 --> 01:02:37.252
How am I doin'?

01:02:37.321 --> 01:02:38.420
Are you happy?

01:02:39.823 --> 01:02:42.891
Yes. I'm really happy.

01:02:44.261 --> 01:02:45.761
Good.

01:02:48.398 --> 01:02:49.731
Yeah, me too.

01:02:50.701 --> 01:02:51.733
Good.

01:02:54.171 --> 01:02:56.171
When we get back home…

01:02:58.208 --> 01:03:01.643
How would you feel
about us trying this for real?

01:03:03.213 --> 01:03:05.413
I would like to take you
out on a real date.

01:03:05.516 --> 01:03:07.048
No contract.

01:03:08.886 --> 01:03:11.353
Oh, yeah. I mean,
I could be into that.

01:03:12.523 --> 01:03:14.156
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

01:03:14.224 --> 01:03:16.858
You're not gonna flake
out on me again, OK?

01:03:18.362 --> 01:03:19.661
Mm-mmm.

01:03:48.492 --> 01:03:50.158
'Mornin' sleepy head.

01:03:50.227 --> 01:03:51.860
'Mornin'.

01:03:51.929 --> 01:03:53.094
Well, you and Jolie
are two peas in a pod.

01:03:53.163 --> 01:03:54.496
She's our night owl.

01:03:54.565 --> 01:03:55.931
Yeah, that's me, too.

01:03:55.999 --> 01:03:57.465
Did I hear my name?

01:03:57.568 --> 01:03:59.301
Yes. Hi, Jo Bear.

01:03:59.403 --> 01:04:00.602
Oh, looks good.

01:04:00.704 --> 01:04:01.903
- It's almost 11.
- Yeah, I know.

01:04:02.005 --> 01:04:03.538
Hi, Maxie.

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:05.473
Gingerbread house time now.

01:04:05.542 --> 01:04:08.443
I know. I could smell it
from all the way upstairs.

01:04:08.512 --> 01:04:09.644
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:04:16.153 --> 01:04:18.687
Moment of truth.

01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:19.988
Are you ready for this?

01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:21.089
Yeah.

01:04:21.191 --> 01:04:23.491
Ta-da!

01:04:23.594 --> 01:04:27.462
Oh, you put the review
of my essay up.

01:04:27.564 --> 01:04:29.664
Yeah, and I built it with Wix

01:04:29.733 --> 01:04:31.499
so if you ever want
to change anything

01:04:31.568 --> 01:04:33.501
or add more glowing reviews,
it's really simple.

01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:34.903
I'll show you how.

01:04:36.673 --> 01:04:40.208
Jolie, this is incredible.

01:04:40.310 --> 01:04:42.244
Well, now…

01:04:43.247 --> 01:04:44.679
It's live.

01:04:45.716 --> 01:04:47.282
- Really?
- Mm-hmm!

01:04:49.653 --> 01:04:51.953
Hey, I'm going to go
for a run. You wanna go?

01:04:52.022 --> 01:04:54.055
No. No, I don't
wanna go for a run.

01:04:55.792 --> 01:04:56.791
I've actually got
some writing to do.

01:04:56.894 --> 01:04:58.593
OK. Have fun.

01:04:58.695 --> 01:05:00.061
All right.

01:05:12.542 --> 01:05:15.777
I just feel like you were
lying to me the whole time.

01:05:15.846 --> 01:05:17.379
No, I wasn't lying.
It's not true at all.

01:05:17.447 --> 01:05:18.980
I think your parents hate me.

01:05:19.049 --> 01:05:20.715
- They don't.
- They hate me!

01:05:20.784 --> 01:05:22.050
No! Just look,
you don't have to leave, Amy.

01:05:22.152 --> 01:05:23.885
You can stay. OK?

01:05:23.987 --> 01:05:25.086
Where you gonna go?

01:05:25.188 --> 01:05:26.388
You gonna go home? Don't.

01:05:26.490 --> 01:05:28.823
Look, Amy… Amy… I'm sorry.

01:05:30.127 --> 01:05:32.127
Look, just, listen to me.

01:05:45.809 --> 01:05:46.808
Hey.

01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:48.443
Hey. You OK?

01:05:48.545 --> 01:05:49.444
What happened?

01:05:49.513 --> 01:05:50.578
We uh…

01:05:52.316 --> 01:05:57.519
We broke up, and
she didn't wanna stay.

01:05:57.621 --> 01:05:59.921
Oh, Foster, I'm really sorry.
That's…

01:06:00.023 --> 01:06:02.891
No, no. It's OK. I mean…

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:05.660
I don't know what I was
thinkin' bringin' her here.

01:06:05.729 --> 01:06:07.896
I… we'd only been dating
for a little while,

01:06:07.998 --> 01:06:09.397
and I just…

01:06:09.466 --> 01:06:12.033
I didn't wanna be
alone on Christmas.

01:06:12.102 --> 01:06:13.902
I've really missed you, Jo-Jo,

01:06:13.971 --> 01:06:18.306
and I brought Amy here
as a distraction, and…

01:06:18.408 --> 01:06:20.675
And now you're with, with Jack.

01:06:20.744 --> 01:06:23.244
Well, I'm… full disclosure,

01:06:23.313 --> 01:06:25.947
I brought Jack here
for the same reason.

01:06:26.016 --> 01:06:27.649
What?

01:06:27.718 --> 01:06:29.150
Yeah, I mean, I wasn't
gonna bring anybody

01:06:29.219 --> 01:06:30.752
until I found out that you were.

01:06:32.289 --> 01:06:34.022
Really?

01:06:34.124 --> 01:06:35.323
Yeah.

01:06:35.425 --> 01:06:38.727
I mean, I'm, I'm not with Amy

01:06:38.795 --> 01:06:40.662
and you're not really with
Jack. I mean, it should be…

01:06:40.764 --> 01:06:41.629
No, no, no.

01:06:41.732 --> 01:06:43.498
Oh, come on.

01:06:43.567 --> 01:06:45.600
I mean, you know we're
not good together, Foster.

01:06:46.837 --> 01:06:48.003
You're right.

01:06:48.105 --> 01:06:49.838
I'm really sorry about Amy.

01:06:49.906 --> 01:06:51.740
Hey, I'm really sorry
I made you bring Jack.

01:06:51.842 --> 01:06:54.009
Don't be.

01:06:54.077 --> 01:06:56.311
I mean, maybe things turned out
this way for a reason, right?

01:06:56.413 --> 01:06:57.879
Yeah.

01:06:57.981 --> 01:06:59.280
I'll see you later.

01:06:59.383 --> 01:07:00.448
- Yeah.
- Behave yourself.

01:07:00.550 --> 01:07:02.484
Oh, no promises.

01:07:07.457 --> 01:07:09.024
<i>Hey, Daddy.</i>

01:07:09.126 --> 01:07:11.159
Hey. Just come back from a run?

01:07:11.228 --> 01:07:12.494
Yes, sir. What you doin'?
Stop it.

01:07:12.562 --> 01:07:13.695
Don't bend over.
Let me help you.

01:07:13.764 --> 01:07:14.996
Well, sure, darlin'.

01:07:17.401 --> 01:07:19.601
I do love havin' you home
for Christmas, peanut.

01:07:19.669 --> 01:07:21.970
Well, I love bein'
home with you.

01:07:22.039 --> 01:07:25.640
You know, uh, your mom
and I are very proud of you.

01:07:27.677 --> 01:07:29.377
Honey, you're in a good place.

01:07:29.446 --> 01:07:31.379
I can see that,

01:07:31.448 --> 01:07:33.515
and the shine on your face
and contentment in your heart.

01:07:34.785 --> 01:07:36.584
Every parent longs for that.

01:07:36.653 --> 01:07:38.853
That brain of yours can
bring you a lot of success

01:07:38.922 --> 01:07:40.789
and impressive accomplishments,

01:07:40.857 --> 01:07:45.193
but, it's that heart you got
that's your greatest gift.

01:07:47.798 --> 01:07:49.497
Well, thanks, Dad.

01:07:52.903 --> 01:07:56.237
Ah, you get it from your momma.

01:07:56.306 --> 01:07:58.940
Yeah, I get it from you, too.

01:08:08.285 --> 01:08:09.150
Hello?

01:08:09.252 --> 01:08:10.752
Hi.

01:08:10.854 --> 01:08:12.620
Hi.
Why are we whispering?

01:08:12.689 --> 01:08:14.923
I'm hiding out.

01:08:14.991 --> 01:08:16.957
If Martin's Aunt Barb finds me,
she's gonna put me on the yams

01:08:17.027 --> 01:08:19.527
then berate me for why
we don't have children yet.

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:21.429
OK, but why am I whispering?

01:08:21.497 --> 01:08:22.697
I didn't say you
needed to whisper.

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:24.332
You just started whispering.

01:08:24.401 --> 01:08:26.801
Oh, OK.
Hey. Merry Christmas.

01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:28.269
- Merry Christmas.
- Naomi?

01:08:28.337 --> 01:08:29.837
Listen, I can't talk long.

01:08:29.906 --> 01:08:31.538
I'm just calling
for some updates.

01:08:31.608 --> 01:08:33.408
- Give me the full details.
- Naomi?

01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:35.609
Yeah, yeah. The Christmas
Market was really good.

01:08:35.679 --> 01:08:39.781
Uh, your brother is
a pretty incredible dancer.

01:08:39.883 --> 01:08:42.684
And Foster is Foster.

01:08:42.786 --> 01:08:44.452
Did something happen?

01:08:44.554 --> 01:08:46.121
<i>Oh, he broke up
with his girlfriend.</i>

01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:48.055
- Oh, no way!
- Yes, way.

01:08:48.125 --> 01:08:52.193
It has definitely been
different than I expected.

01:08:52.295 --> 01:08:53.995
How so?

01:08:54.064 --> 01:08:57.432
Well, would you be,
like, weirded-out at all

01:08:57.501 --> 01:08:59.000
if your brother and I…

01:08:59.069 --> 01:09:00.902
Yeah?

01:09:01.004 --> 01:09:02.470
Were maybe more than friends?

01:09:02.572 --> 01:09:04.538
Oh, my gosh!

01:09:04.608 --> 01:09:06.006
Baby, there you go.

01:09:06.076 --> 01:09:07.475
I've been lookin'
for you everywhere.

01:09:07.544 --> 01:09:08.743
Naomi?

01:09:08.812 --> 01:09:09.978
Shoot! Martin just found me.

01:09:10.046 --> 01:09:12.080
Listen, baby, I need backup.

01:09:12.149 --> 01:09:13.948
My parents, they're harassing
me about having babies again.

01:09:14.050 --> 01:09:15.183
Listen, I gotta go.

01:09:15.285 --> 01:09:16.216
Okay. Well, I love you two.

01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:17.952
Merry Christmas.

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:19.420
Merry Christmas,
and I want full details.

01:09:19.523 --> 01:09:21.156
Yeah, sure.

01:09:21.258 --> 01:09:22.924
Not full details,
because it's my brother.

01:09:22.993 --> 01:09:24.459
- What?
- My God!

01:09:24.528 --> 01:09:26.261
<i>You're with my brother!</i>

01:09:26.363 --> 01:09:28.296
OK. Bye, Naomi.

01:09:41.611 --> 01:09:42.743
<i>This is Devon. Leave a message.</i>

01:09:42.812 --> 01:09:45.078
Hey, Devon, it's Jack.

01:09:45.148 --> 01:09:47.948
Uh, listen, I'm not going to be
able to write this book for you.

01:09:48.018 --> 01:09:50.185
Things have gotten
kind of complicated,

01:09:50.252 --> 01:09:53.888
and it um, just doesn't
feel right anymore.

01:09:53.957 --> 01:09:55.490
All right?

01:09:55.559 --> 01:09:57.625
I will talk to you
after the holidays.

01:10:00.864 --> 01:10:02.130
Merry Christmas.

01:10:05.135 --> 01:10:06.734
Wow!

01:10:06.836 --> 01:10:08.336
You look beautiful.

01:10:09.673 --> 01:10:10.905
Thanks, Jack.

01:10:12.609 --> 01:10:13.575
Come on.

01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:48.810
Foster?

01:10:50.146 --> 01:10:51.246
Foster!

01:10:51.314 --> 01:10:52.680
Yeah, oh. All right. Sorry.

01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:54.349
I mean, do you think
we have a chance

01:10:54.417 --> 01:10:55.950
of maybe getting a bowl
game this year or what?

01:10:56.052 --> 01:10:58.219
Yeah. Yeah, I, I, I don't know.

01:10:58.288 --> 01:11:00.555
Hey, what do you guys
know about Jack?

01:11:00.624 --> 01:11:02.257
He's Naomi's brother.

01:11:02.325 --> 01:11:04.225
I don't know. He's a writer.

01:11:04.327 --> 01:11:06.194
She said they hooked up
in New York.

01:11:07.564 --> 01:11:08.830
Oh, she said that?

01:11:08.932 --> 01:11:09.897
Yeah.

01:11:11.668 --> 01:11:13.935
- OK. Bye.
- Bye.

01:11:16.239 --> 01:11:17.538
Hi guys. How are you?

01:11:17.607 --> 01:11:19.073
Excuse me.

01:11:26.983 --> 01:11:28.349
- Hey, Jo-Jo. Jo-Jo.
- What?

01:11:28.451 --> 01:11:29.951
Uh, sorry, Dan.

01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:31.552
Can I talk to you for a second?

01:11:32.889 --> 01:11:34.422
- Yeah.
- OK.

01:11:36.126 --> 01:11:37.825
Hey, everybody.

01:11:37.894 --> 01:11:40.328
You guys wanna play
a little Christmas song?

01:11:40.397 --> 01:11:42.196
- Yeah.
- All right, all right.

01:11:45.602 --> 01:11:48.102
What's up?

01:11:48.204 --> 01:11:50.405
I've been thinking a lot
about what you said earlier.

01:11:50.507 --> 01:11:52.006
About us.

01:11:53.276 --> 01:11:54.776
I think you're wrong.

01:11:54.878 --> 01:11:57.345
And I want you
to stay here with me.

01:11:57.447 --> 01:11:59.013
Foster, come on.

01:11:59.115 --> 01:12:00.448
It's always been you and me.

01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:03.851
No, it hasn't.

I don't remember
your favorite tea

01:12:51.935 --> 01:12:53.134
and now you think we're not…

01:12:53.203 --> 01:12:54.902
Foster, you don't listen to me.

01:12:55.004 --> 01:12:56.637
You don't.

01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:58.439
I'm with Jack now.

01:12:58.508 --> 01:13:00.074
Yeah, but you only
brought Jack here

01:13:00.143 --> 01:13:01.876
- to make me jealous.
- I did, at first.

01:13:01.978 --> 01:13:05.313
But, it's different.

01:13:05.382 --> 01:13:07.315
Look, I know you think
we're not right for each other,

01:13:07.384 --> 01:13:09.917
but I can't help but think
that you're wrong about this.

01:13:09.986 --> 01:13:12.620
I'm so sorry, but I really think

01:13:12.689 --> 01:13:14.622
I have something
very special with him.

01:13:14.691 --> 01:13:17.625
Yeah, but you and Jack
are in a fake relationship!

01:13:40.717 --> 01:13:42.150
Come in.

01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:45.753
Hi. Can I come in?

01:13:45.855 --> 01:13:50.658
Yeah. Quite a car ride, huh?

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:52.326
You think?

01:13:52.395 --> 01:13:55.396
I mean, I feel so stupid.
I'm sorry.!

01:13:55.498 --> 01:13:57.698
I shouldn't have said
anything to Foster about you.

01:13:57.767 --> 01:13:59.434
No, you don't have anything
to be sorry for.

01:13:59.536 --> 01:14:01.903
No, now, it's super
uncomfortable.

01:14:02.005 --> 01:14:03.471
Yeah, it is.

01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:05.339
I don't wanna go back out there.

01:14:05.442 --> 01:14:09.243
I mean, I don't know how
to spin this with my family.

01:14:09.312 --> 01:14:12.246
Well, maybe
there's nothing to spin.

01:14:13.850 --> 01:14:16.851
I like you, and
you like me, so…

01:14:23.526 --> 01:14:24.625
What is this?

01:14:25.929 --> 01:14:27.995
Oh, just some work stuff.

01:14:29.065 --> 01:14:30.498
"Dance under the stars.

01:14:38.741 --> 01:14:41.042
Yeah, it's for this book
that I'm ghostwriting.

01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:43.244
Just a lot of things the
characters are supposed to do.

01:14:43.346 --> 01:14:46.214
But we did all these things.

01:14:46.282 --> 01:14:49.050
Yeah, I mean, but most
of that is just a coincidence.

01:14:50.253 --> 01:14:51.752
No.

01:14:51.821 --> 01:14:53.554
No, you didn't stumble
on a flower.

01:14:53.623 --> 01:14:57.325
You… made that for me.
You made this happen.

01:14:57.427 --> 01:14:59.560
OK, I'm realizing that
this sounds bad,

01:14:59.629 --> 01:15:01.462
but I, it's not
what it looks like.

01:15:01.564 --> 01:15:03.598
Is this…
"make her fall in love"?

01:15:03.666 --> 01:15:04.966
Yeah, but that's not about you.

01:15:05.068 --> 01:15:07.034
So what is it?

01:15:07.136 --> 01:15:08.803
Is it just like a checklist
that you're trying to get done

01:15:08.872 --> 01:15:10.271
- while you're here?
- No.

01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:13.040
Is this why you came here?

01:15:13.109 --> 01:15:15.042
I feel really stupid.

01:15:15.144 --> 01:15:16.878
Why? No, why do you feel stupid?

01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:19.080
Like last night,
that was real to me.

01:15:19.182 --> 01:15:20.581
Yeah, it was real to me, too.

01:15:20.683 --> 01:15:22.216
No, just save it, all right?

01:15:22.318 --> 01:15:23.851
Hey, Jolie,
would you just slow down?

01:15:23.953 --> 01:15:25.520
You should stay
at my sister's house.

01:15:25.588 --> 01:15:26.954
There's a flight out tomorrow.

01:15:27.023 --> 01:15:28.823
Hey, Jolie…

01:15:47.410 --> 01:15:49.210
Oh, Jack, I don't want to talk.

01:15:49.279 --> 01:15:51.078
Jo Bear, it's me.

01:15:58.655 --> 01:16:02.123
Hi, baby. Breonna
told me what happened.

01:16:02.191 --> 01:16:05.126
They're gonna take Jack up to
their house to stay the night.

01:16:05.194 --> 01:16:07.128
Momma, I'm really sorry.

01:16:07.230 --> 01:16:09.330
Oh, don't be sorry.

01:16:09.399 --> 01:16:11.098
No, I lied to you,

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:13.601
and I ruined Christmas,
and I just…

01:16:13.670 --> 01:16:15.236
I don't even know
what I was thinking.

01:16:15.305 --> 01:16:17.104
You didn't ruin anything,

01:16:17.206 --> 01:16:20.007
and you were thinking
that you wanted to get away

01:16:20.109 --> 01:16:21.576
from all that drama.

01:16:21.644 --> 01:16:23.911
That backfired a little bit.

01:16:24.013 --> 01:16:25.947
Yeah, it kinda did, didn't it?

01:16:28.785 --> 01:16:30.551
I want you to listen
to your momma.

01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:33.621
I know you.
I know your heart, Jolie.

01:16:33.723 --> 01:16:36.857
This was just somethin'
you had to do.

01:16:36.926 --> 01:16:39.527
And you don't have
to be sorry about anything.

01:16:42.165 --> 01:16:43.798
I thought I could trust him.

01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:45.900
Like he seemed really different.

01:16:46.002 --> 01:16:48.436
Let me ask you a question,

01:16:48.504 --> 01:16:51.205
if this wasn't supposed
to be anything serious,

01:16:53.242 --> 01:16:55.109
why are you so upset?

01:16:59.549 --> 01:17:00.615
I don't know.

01:17:04.721 --> 01:17:05.920
Oh, sweetie.

01:17:15.298 --> 01:17:17.131
- Hot chocolate?
- Hm?

01:17:17.233 --> 01:17:18.366
Oh, thanks, Daddy.

01:17:19.569 --> 01:17:21.202
Careful. Careful.

01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:22.703
Thank you, sweetheart.

01:17:22.805 --> 01:17:23.904
Ah!

01:17:44.927 --> 01:17:47.094
Thanks for comin' by, Jack.

01:17:47.196 --> 01:17:48.162
Yeah, of course.

01:17:48.264 --> 01:17:49.497
You didn't have to.

01:17:49.565 --> 01:17:50.631
Well, sulkin' around your house

01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:52.199
until my flight leaves

01:17:52.268 --> 01:17:53.968
didn't sound
especially productive.

01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:55.903
Well, if it helps,

01:17:55.972 --> 01:17:58.406
I've never seen Jolie
so happy as she was with you.

01:17:58.508 --> 01:18:00.007
True that.

01:18:00.109 --> 01:18:01.142
Thanks.

01:18:02.912 --> 01:18:05.379
I wish I could have
explained myself better.

01:18:05.481 --> 01:18:07.782
I, I quit this book
that I'm working on.

01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:13.120
I swear that it was just a coincidence
some of these things happened.

01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:15.289
I believe you.

01:18:15.391 --> 01:18:17.291
And it's not so bad, you know,

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:19.193
if you have feelings for her.

01:18:21.798 --> 01:18:22.830
Don't you?

01:18:28.037 --> 01:18:29.303
I need her to know.

01:18:31.708 --> 01:18:34.075
I might have a plan,

01:18:34.143 --> 01:18:36.177
but I'm going
to need you guys' help.

01:18:36.279 --> 01:18:37.244
Anything.

01:18:38.481 --> 01:18:39.880
Your parents, too.

01:18:45.621 --> 01:18:46.787
Hey, Mom?

01:18:48.091 --> 01:18:49.590
We're gonna need your help.

01:19:00.069 --> 01:19:01.268
- Shh…
- Hey!

01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:03.104
Where is everybody?

01:19:03.206 --> 01:19:04.705
Sweetheart, I want you
to go right back upstairs,

01:19:04.807 --> 01:19:06.373
get all cleaned up,

01:19:06.442 --> 01:19:07.842
and put on that really
pretty red dress.

01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:09.176
Your dad's gonna bring you.

01:19:09.245 --> 01:19:10.377
Yeah.

01:19:10.446 --> 01:19:11.846
Bring me where?

01:19:15.218 --> 01:19:16.283
Dad?

01:19:16.385 --> 01:19:17.852
Go!

01:19:28.631 --> 01:19:30.498
Daddy, what are we doing here?

01:19:34.003 --> 01:19:35.136
Jo-Jo.

01:19:36.272 --> 01:19:38.439
You deserve to be happy.

01:19:38.541 --> 01:19:40.941
To be with someone
who truly loves you

01:19:41.043 --> 01:19:43.043
and cherishes you,

01:19:43.112 --> 01:19:45.746
and… listens to you.

01:19:45.815 --> 01:19:49.583
So, hear him out, OK?

01:19:50.553 --> 01:19:51.919
Hear who out?

01:19:54.123 --> 01:19:55.756
Come on.

01:20:12.708 --> 01:20:15.142
<i>"Flee from danger.</i>

01:20:15.211 --> 01:20:18.212
<i>So, we didn't really have to
flee from an alligator that day,</i>

01:20:18.281 --> 01:20:20.014
<i>but listening to you speak</i>

01:20:20.082 --> 01:20:22.483
<i>about your passion
for where you came from,</i>

01:20:22.552 --> 01:20:25.586
<i>this is when I fell in love
with your home."</i>

01:20:51.547 --> 01:20:53.480
<i>"Teach a skill or game.</i>

01:20:53.549 --> 01:20:55.850
<i>Sharing my family's
traditions with yours,</i>

01:20:55.918 --> 01:20:58.018
<i>and seeing the love and support
from the people who raised you</i>

01:20:58.087 --> 01:21:00.354
<i>and made you the woman
you are today,</i>

01:21:00.423 --> 01:21:02.289
<i>I fell in love
with your family."</i>

01:21:20.576 --> 01:21:22.977
<i>"Dance under the stars.</i>

01:21:23.045 --> 01:21:25.312
<i>When I held you in my arms
that night,</i>

01:21:25.381 --> 01:21:27.715
<i>I knew I never
wanted to let you go."</i>

01:21:48.404 --> 01:21:51.972
<i>"Give her a flower,
first kiss in a special place.</i>

01:21:52.041 --> 01:21:55.009
<i>Jolie, I meant everything
I said to you.</i>

01:21:55.077 --> 01:21:57.978
<i>And if getting romantic advice
from a Parker Hollowell novel</i>

01:21:58.047 --> 01:22:00.080
<i>led me to fall in love with you,</i>

01:22:00.182 --> 01:22:03.651
<i>well, I'd do it over
and over again."</i>

01:22:13.529 --> 01:22:16.730
<i>"Profess love
in a passionate speech.</i>

01:22:16.799 --> 01:22:19.166
<i>The last thing on my list
I have left to do,</i>

01:22:19.268 --> 01:22:20.768
<i>if you'll let me.</i>

01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:22.503
I would have missed out on a lot

01:22:22.605 --> 01:22:25.773
if my sister hadn't
drafted that contract.

01:22:25.841 --> 01:22:27.741
I never would have gotten
to experience

01:22:27.843 --> 01:22:29.910
a Guidry Christmas,

01:22:29.979 --> 01:22:32.212
or hear you play the fiddle,

01:22:32.315 --> 01:22:34.315
or try gumbo so hot

01:22:34.383 --> 01:22:36.650
that I actually forgot
who I was for 10 minutes.

01:22:38.554 --> 01:22:40.688
But more than anything,

01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:42.523
I wouldn't have
gotten to know you.

01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:46.827
You're all
the good things, Jolie.

01:22:49.899 --> 01:22:53.133
And, I love you, and I know
that you asked me to leave,

01:22:53.235 --> 01:22:54.435
- but I…
- Jack.

01:22:57.606 --> 01:22:58.806
I love you too.

01:23:10.886 --> 01:23:12.786
Hey, listen,
I called my agent yesterday,

01:23:12.888 --> 01:23:14.188
and I'm not writing that book.

01:23:14.290 --> 01:23:16.357
Oh, stop it. You have to.

01:23:16.425 --> 01:23:18.125
What?

01:23:18.194 --> 01:23:19.660
You can say it
was based on a true story.

01:23:22.031 --> 01:23:23.230
Come on.
