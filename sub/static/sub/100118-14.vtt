WEBVTT

00:01.566 --> 00:03.916
Previously onDynasty...Will you marry me?

00:03.960 --> 00:05.788
You know
who's gonna tune in to see you

00:05.831 --> 00:07.703
and your unknown
daughter? No one.

00:07.746 --> 00:09.922
This woman killed
my unborn baby.

00:09.966 --> 00:11.837
There needs to be a price
for her actions.

00:11.881 --> 00:13.317
MICHAEL:
Vanessa's back in town.

00:13.361 --> 00:16.016
If she ever found
out about us...Michael, relax.

00:16.059 --> 00:17.843
Last night can be
our little secret.

00:17.887 --> 00:20.672
See, there are plenty of other
pharma companies I can buy.

00:20.716 --> 00:21.717
But there's
only one C.A.

00:21.760 --> 00:22.848
And it will be mine.

00:22.892 --> 00:24.024
BLAKE:
Well, if it's war they want,

00:24.067 --> 00:25.242
it's war they'll get.

00:28.115 --> 00:30.682
Wait, this is the music
you're suggesting?

00:30.726 --> 00:32.510
"Sweet Caroline"?

00:32.554 --> 00:34.730
This is an engagement party,
not a bat mitzvah.

00:34.773 --> 00:35.818
Oy vey.

00:35.861 --> 00:37.037
So, what are you thinking?

00:37.080 --> 00:38.777
I have a call out
to John Mayer's people.

00:38.821 --> 00:39.996
Really?

00:40.040 --> 00:41.998
He's a very talented blues
guitarist, okay?

00:42.042 --> 00:44.218
Great. So can we make
some other decisions now?

00:44.261 --> 00:45.697
I need to get back to the hotel.

00:45.741 --> 00:47.134
There's a lot I need to do
between now and the party.

00:47.177 --> 00:49.223
Okay. Well, we have to wait
until Liam gets here.

00:49.266 --> 00:50.659
And I don't know what
kind of a mood you're in.

00:50.702 --> 00:52.052
You're very cranky. Is it
because the married man

00:52.095 --> 00:53.444
broke up with you?Yeah,

00:53.488 --> 00:54.750
that's definitely part of it.

00:54.793 --> 00:56.143
ALEXIS:
I'm here! Ooh!

00:56.186 --> 00:57.144
I hope these are mimosas,

00:57.187 --> 00:58.580
because we have
a party to plan

00:58.623 --> 01:00.016
and an engagement
to celebrate.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.409
Now, when I give my speech...

01:01.452 --> 01:03.498
No. No speech.

01:03.541 --> 01:05.674
How did you even find out
about this meeting?
You weren't invited.

01:05.717 --> 01:07.937
It was in my calendar.How did it get
in your calendar?

01:07.980 --> 01:09.765
I might have come by yesterday
to sneak a peek at your schedule

01:09.808 --> 01:11.332
when your assistant
was in the bathroom.

01:11.375 --> 01:13.116
I told Allison to keep
an eye out for you.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.423
You know, this is exactly
why I hate labor laws.

01:15.466 --> 01:17.599
Okay, guys,
I don't have all day.

01:17.642 --> 01:19.514
What?
Liam isn't coming.

01:19.557 --> 01:20.341
He said
something came up.

01:20.384 --> 01:21.516
Is everything okay?

01:21.559 --> 01:22.952
I-I don't know.

01:22.995 --> 01:24.432
I mean, I
thought it was.

01:24.475 --> 01:27.435
London and the proposal-- it
was amazing and so romantic.

01:27.478 --> 01:28.958
But ever since we got
back, he's been weird.

01:29.001 --> 01:31.569
You know,
being a newlywed myself...

01:31.613 --> 01:32.831
Oh. Here we go.Oh, my God.

01:32.875 --> 01:34.703
...it's important to keep up
that fiery passion

01:34.746 --> 01:37.227
or you risk losing
the spark entirely.

01:37.271 --> 01:39.360
Please never say
"fiery passion" again.

01:39.403 --> 01:41.797
Liam is probably starting
to think of you as his wife,

01:41.840 --> 01:43.190
not his girlfriend.

01:43.233 --> 01:45.148
It's not quite as exciting
when one is

01:45.192 --> 01:47.672
"getting the milk for free,"
as the kids say.

01:47.716 --> 01:49.413
No kids say that.

01:49.457 --> 01:50.893
But you do have a point.

01:50.936 --> 01:53.722
I mean, I suppose I could
spice things up a little.

01:53.765 --> 01:58.118
You know, remind Mr. Ridley
exactly how lucky he is.

01:58.161 --> 01:59.510
DOMINIQUE:
Cristal.

01:59.554 --> 02:03.340
Just the sister-in-law
I was looking for.

02:03.384 --> 02:04.428
Dominique.
For a moment,

02:04.472 --> 02:05.516
I almost forgot
you were living here.

02:05.560 --> 02:06.778
It was nice.

02:06.822 --> 02:09.390
You might want to
rethink your tone,

02:09.433 --> 02:11.305
all things considered.

02:11.348 --> 02:13.959
I'm sure Blake
would be very interested

02:14.003 --> 02:16.440
to hear about your
mysterious hotel guest.

02:16.484 --> 02:18.050
You followed me?

02:18.094 --> 02:19.748
I think you're focusing
on the wrong issue, sweetie.

02:19.791 --> 02:22.490
What did you hear?Hear? I didn't stick around
long enough

02:22.533 --> 02:23.926
to catch the audiobook.

02:23.969 --> 02:25.971
I know a cheater when I see one.

02:27.669 --> 02:30.193
I made a mistake.

02:30.237 --> 02:32.456
I was having an affair with...

02:32.500 --> 02:35.633
that man, but I-- it didn't mean
anything and I ended it.

02:35.677 --> 02:37.418
That's why I went there
that day.

02:37.461 --> 02:40.464
Still, I'm sure your husband
wouldn't like hearing about

02:40.508 --> 02:42.597
your little mistake.Just tell me what you want.

02:42.640 --> 02:45.513
I'm inviting Vanessa
to live in the manor.

02:45.556 --> 02:47.515
And you are going to
welcome her with open arms.

02:47.558 --> 02:48.516
Fine.

02:48.559 --> 02:49.560
Just...

02:49.604 --> 02:51.301
please don't tell Blake
anything.

02:51.345 --> 02:53.434
Don't worry.
It will be our little secret.

02:53.477 --> 02:55.610
I'm glad we could come
to an agreement.

03:01.355 --> 03:03.400
I may have been a little harsh

03:03.444 --> 03:06.403
when I threatened to
expel you from the loft.

03:06.447 --> 03:07.839
You mean when you banished me

03:07.883 --> 03:09.928
and threatened
to cut me out of the will?

03:09.972 --> 03:11.930
Well, you did burn down
my vineyard.

03:14.411 --> 03:17.153
We all do crazy things
when we...

03:17.197 --> 03:19.242
think we've lost
something precious.

03:19.286 --> 03:21.113
I know I have.

03:22.637 --> 03:24.508
I want you to move back,

03:24.552 --> 03:25.988
here where you belong.

03:26.031 --> 03:27.250
That's very generous,
but Mother and I

03:27.294 --> 03:28.817
are finally in a good place
and I don't want

03:28.860 --> 03:30.645
to betray her trust
by moving back here.

03:30.688 --> 03:33.300
So I assume
she's told you about Jeff?

03:33.343 --> 03:35.127
His illness?What illness?

03:35.171 --> 03:36.520
Well...

03:36.564 --> 03:38.522
whatever you used to poison him,

03:38.566 --> 03:41.003
it worked
just a little too well.

03:41.046 --> 03:44.615
He has some degenerative
condition called, uh,

03:44.659 --> 03:46.226
neurotoxicity.

03:46.269 --> 03:48.010
But I guess if your mother
didn't tell you that, she...

03:48.053 --> 03:50.534
must still not trust
you completely.

03:50.578 --> 03:54.016
Jeff is days away
from having his offer

03:54.059 --> 03:57.411
to buy Carrington Atlantic
accepted by the VKI board.

03:57.454 --> 04:00.501
I can make them aware
of his illness and prognosis.

04:00.544 --> 04:01.850
Might stop the sale...

04:01.893 --> 04:03.678
Seeing as I'm the one
who poisoned him,

04:03.721 --> 04:07.638
that might put me in
an unpleasant legal situation.

04:07.682 --> 04:09.118
Which is exactly why I need

04:09.161 --> 04:10.728
an alternative
strategy.

04:10.772 --> 04:13.296
I think Jeff is blackmailing
Dustin Sawyer,

04:13.340 --> 04:14.993
the current CEO of C.A.

04:15.037 --> 04:17.082
I suppose it's possible.

04:17.126 --> 04:20.129
I want you to get that blackmail
so I can use it as leverage.

04:20.172 --> 04:22.436
If Jeff and I are on a level
playing field, he won't win.

04:22.479 --> 04:23.785
And once we get C.A.,

04:23.828 --> 04:27.136
you and I can run
the family dynasty together.

04:34.622 --> 04:36.319
I can do it tomorrow night.

04:36.363 --> 04:37.842
Jeff won't be at home.

04:37.886 --> 04:40.018
I just need to keep Alexis out
of my hair for a few hours.

04:40.062 --> 04:41.629
I can handle that.

04:49.767 --> 04:50.899
Oh.

04:50.942 --> 04:52.727
That looks...
relaxing?

04:52.770 --> 04:53.858
It's cupping.

04:53.902 --> 04:55.991
Helps draw toxins out
of the system

04:56.034 --> 04:58.298
and improves mental clarity.

04:58.341 --> 04:59.603
I can't risk losing my edge.

04:59.647 --> 05:01.301
Not until we close this deal.

05:01.344 --> 05:03.215
Before you move
on to leeches,

05:03.259 --> 05:06.697
may I remind you that everything
is going according to plan.

05:06.741 --> 05:08.612
And may I remind you
this is Blake Carrington.

05:08.656 --> 05:10.571
He's not gonna give up C.A.
without a fight.

05:10.614 --> 05:12.573
Try not to worry so much.

05:12.616 --> 05:14.749
You might pop a cup.

05:14.792 --> 05:17.795
If Blake were up to something,
we would know about it and...

05:17.839 --> 05:19.319
I would be concerned.

05:19.362 --> 05:23.323
Now, do I look like I have
a care in the world?

05:23.366 --> 05:24.324
JENNINGS:
It'll be the perfect time

05:24.367 --> 05:26.238
to get rid of her.
Alexis will be

05:26.282 --> 05:28.110
at Fallon's engagement party
this weekend.

05:28.153 --> 05:29.198
Consider it done.

05:29.241 --> 05:30.765
And when you say "done..."?

05:30.808 --> 05:32.114
Explosive under the car,

05:32.157 --> 05:33.420
remote detonator.

05:33.463 --> 05:34.812
I'll plant the device
when she's in the party,

05:34.856 --> 05:36.161
stand by for
her to leave,

05:36.205 --> 05:37.989
and when she does...
detonate.

05:38.033 --> 05:40.905
It'll look like a faulty gas
tank caused the explosion.

05:40.949 --> 05:43.081
She'll be driving a black SUV,

05:43.125 --> 05:44.909
but I'll text you the specifics.

05:44.953 --> 05:46.911
Got it.
This will be our last meeting.

05:46.955 --> 05:48.304
We can't risk being seen
together.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.871
No one knows we're here.

05:49.914 --> 05:52.656
But, actually, there is someone
I need you to avoid.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.745
Dominique Deveraux.What are you talking about?

05:54.789 --> 05:56.138
She followed me the other day.

05:56.181 --> 05:57.531
She thinks you and I
are having an affair.

05:57.574 --> 05:58.880
I would just make sure
she doesn't see you

05:58.923 --> 05:59.924
anywhere near that party.

05:59.968 --> 06:00.925
Just to be safe.

06:00.969 --> 06:02.971
We're done here.Seriously?

06:03.014 --> 06:04.842
W-- She's already
kind of crazy.

06:04.886 --> 06:06.627
No one
would even believe her.

06:06.670 --> 06:09.281
I-I'll pay you double.It's not worth it.

06:09.325 --> 06:11.371
All it takes is one person
picking me out of a lineup

06:11.414 --> 06:13.024
and I spend
the rest of my life in prison.

06:13.068 --> 06:14.112
This is not happening.

06:14.156 --> 06:15.418
I'm sorry.

06:30.651 --> 06:33.349
♪ Got to keep myself
entertained ♪

06:33.393 --> 06:34.916
♪ You're messing with my brain

06:34.959 --> 06:36.134
No.

06:36.178 --> 06:37.222
LIAM:
Hello?

06:37.266 --> 06:38.223
In here!

06:39.486 --> 06:41.096
Hey, sailor.

06:41.139 --> 06:42.271
Wow.

06:43.315 --> 06:45.361
That outfit's, uh...

06:45.405 --> 06:47.232
I really should've called ahead.

06:47.276 --> 06:49.278
Why?Um...

06:49.321 --> 06:50.453
Oh.

06:50.497 --> 06:52.150
Oh. Okay.

06:52.194 --> 06:55.153
This isn't exactly what I meant
when I said "spice things up,"

06:55.197 --> 06:56.459
but, yeah, let's do it.

06:56.503 --> 06:59.244
Liam, this seems
like a bad time.

06:59.288 --> 07:00.811
Uh, Fallon,
this is Heidi

07:00.855 --> 07:03.118
from my high school
study abroad program.

07:03.161 --> 07:04.511
She's the one I told
you about, remember?

07:04.554 --> 07:06.382
Yes. Yes, obviously,

07:06.426 --> 07:09.037
I remember the woman
you had an unplanned child with.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.647
But I thought
you mentioned that the two

07:10.691 --> 07:12.432
of you hadn't spoken
since you decided

07:12.475 --> 07:14.085
to put the baby up for adoption.

07:14.129 --> 07:16.044
So I guess I'm just wondering
what she's doing here right now

07:16.087 --> 07:17.045
while I'm in lingerie.

07:17.088 --> 07:18.133
We hadn't spoken.

07:18.176 --> 07:19.700
Until they showed up
the other night.

07:19.743 --> 07:20.788
They?

07:20.831 --> 07:22.398
No, no, no, no, no.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.400
I'll just...

07:24.444 --> 07:26.402
Fallon, this is Connor, my son.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.969
Well, he has your eyes.

07:28.012 --> 07:29.449
I think.

07:30.275 --> 07:31.233
No, no, no.
Keep your hand there.

07:31.276 --> 07:32.408
Keep your hand there.

07:57.694 --> 07:58.652
Adoption was the plan.

07:58.695 --> 08:00.262
But when I gave birth to Connor,

08:00.305 --> 08:01.437
I just couldn't bear
to give him up.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.265
So I decided to
raise him, alone.

08:03.308 --> 08:04.484
Right.

08:04.527 --> 08:06.094
You know, I've seen
this movie before.

08:06.137 --> 08:08.270
So, how much will it take

08:08.313 --> 08:11.142
for you to go back to wherever
it is that you came from?

08:11.186 --> 08:12.448
California?

08:12.492 --> 08:13.971
LIAM: Fallon, please...No. I mean, really.

08:14.015 --> 08:16.365
Why else would she show up
with a Van Kirk heir as soon

08:16.408 --> 08:17.584
as you get engaged
to a Carrington?

08:17.627 --> 08:18.802
I am only here

08:18.846 --> 08:20.587
because Connor wanted to
meet his father.

08:20.630 --> 08:22.023
How do we even know
that that's your kid?

08:22.066 --> 08:23.677
I mean, maybe you just rented
him for the weekend

08:23.720 --> 08:25.156
to extort my fiancé.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.288
Who rents a child?

08:26.331 --> 08:27.376
People do it, okay?

08:27.419 --> 08:28.595
It happens.LIAM: Okay, I...

08:28.638 --> 08:30.074
I think
that's enough for tonight.

08:30.118 --> 08:31.511
Yeah. I should go.

08:31.554 --> 08:33.513
Connor's waiting for me
downstairs.

08:33.556 --> 08:35.602
It was nice to meet you.

08:35.645 --> 08:36.994
And congratulations.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.999
I know this is
a lot to process.

08:43.784 --> 08:45.350
But they're only in
town for a few days,

08:45.394 --> 08:47.701
and I feel like I should spend
at least some time with him.

08:47.744 --> 08:48.702
Of course you do.

08:48.745 --> 08:50.399
Because you're good and kind

08:50.442 --> 08:52.314
and painfully compassionate.

08:52.357 --> 08:53.707
I understand.

08:53.750 --> 08:56.013
I mean, I really don't,
but, you know, in theory.

08:56.057 --> 08:58.538
Heidi needs to go to Savannah
for a meeting tomorrow,

08:58.581 --> 09:01.018
so she asked if I would spend
the afternoon with Connor.

09:01.062 --> 09:02.324
And then we'll go to dinner?

09:02.367 --> 09:03.586
I mean, if you put some sushi
in front of me,

09:03.630 --> 09:05.109
I could probably eat it.

09:05.153 --> 09:06.458
It's a date.

09:06.502 --> 09:08.417
And maybe afterwards
you can, uh,

09:08.460 --> 09:09.418
wear this outfit again?

09:09.461 --> 09:10.811
This outfit?Yeah.

09:10.854 --> 09:12.508
The outfit that your
ten-year-old son saw me wearing?

09:12.552 --> 09:15.293
No. This outfit
is getting incinerated.

09:16.338 --> 09:18.470
Don't let it get to your head,

09:18.514 --> 09:20.298
but you're really good at that.

09:20.342 --> 09:22.083
I couldn't have done it
without you.

09:22.126 --> 09:24.346
Actually, I could've,

09:24.389 --> 09:26.348
but it wouldn't have been
near as much fun.

09:30.352 --> 09:32.615
Um, where are you going?

09:32.659 --> 09:34.530
I have songs to write.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.880
Speaking of which,

09:36.924 --> 09:38.621
I have a favor to ask.

09:38.665 --> 09:40.014
Name it.Actually,

09:40.057 --> 09:41.363
it was Dominique's idea.

09:42.407 --> 09:43.757
Fallon said

09:43.800 --> 09:45.193
that she wanted to sign me
to their record label,

09:45.236 --> 09:46.586
but then nothing happened.

09:46.629 --> 09:48.152
So my mom thought

09:48.196 --> 09:49.980
you could talk to Fallon
about it?

09:50.024 --> 09:51.547
She said you owed her a favor.

09:53.157 --> 09:54.332
I know.

09:54.376 --> 09:56.552
It's weird, right?
Because she's your ex.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.641
You know what, forget it.
I'll just tell Dominique

09:58.685 --> 10:00.600
to do it herself.Uh, no!

10:00.643 --> 10:02.514
It's fine.
It's fine.

10:02.558 --> 10:05.909
I actually have to stop
by Fallon's office anyway.

10:05.953 --> 10:08.738
And I do owe
Dominique a favor.

10:08.782 --> 10:10.087
She gave me a great...

10:10.131 --> 10:11.611
chiropractor.

10:11.654 --> 10:12.916
Oh.

10:12.960 --> 10:13.917
Well, thank you.

10:19.183 --> 10:20.707
Okay, so, uh, quick question.

10:20.750 --> 10:24.711
Why do, uh, all of your ideas
involve releasing live doves

10:24.754 --> 10:25.712
inside my hotel?

10:25.755 --> 10:27.365
Maybe because she's insane?

10:27.409 --> 10:28.715
An engagement party
without birds

10:28.758 --> 10:30.891
is like a birthday
without cake.

10:30.934 --> 10:32.370
Pretty sure you
just made that up.

10:32.414 --> 10:33.676
The dress looks amazing.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.460
But, what's
with the stress-face?

10:35.504 --> 10:38.507
Oh, well, maybe it's
because the two of you

10:38.550 --> 10:39.769
are planning my party
without me?

10:39.813 --> 10:42.424
No one is trying to step
on your toes, dear,

10:42.467 --> 10:44.165
but we're getting
down to the wire

10:44.208 --> 10:47.603
and you have been a little...
uninvolved lately.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.126
Well, maybe I've been,
you know, busy,

10:49.170 --> 10:51.476
stressed out, I don't know,
because of the new company,

10:51.520 --> 10:53.174
or my engagement,

10:53.217 --> 10:55.480
or my fiancé's
baby mama and son

10:55.524 --> 10:57.395
showing up unannounced,
or house-hunting...

10:57.439 --> 10:59.049
Wait, say that again.Stop, go back.

10:59.093 --> 11:00.442
House-hunting?

11:48.925 --> 11:50.622
ALEXIS:
Raising a child

11:50.666 --> 11:52.450
is no walk in the park.

11:52.494 --> 11:55.279
They become your top priority.

11:55.323 --> 11:57.368
How would you know?
You skipped my tenth birthday

11:57.412 --> 12:00.458
because you thought Kenny G
invited you backstage.

12:00.502 --> 12:01.721
How many times
do I have to tell you?

12:01.764 --> 12:03.766
That voice mail
was very misleading.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.637
Anyway, this is
completely different, okay?

12:05.681 --> 12:07.639
Liam doesn't have
to be a father

12:07.683 --> 12:09.641
just because
he "suddenly has a son."

12:09.685 --> 12:11.818
Isn't that the exact
definition of fatherhood?

12:11.861 --> 12:15.473
How do you feel about being
this boy's stepmother?

12:15.517 --> 12:16.648
Uh...

12:16.692 --> 12:18.346
I am not his stepmother!

12:18.389 --> 12:19.564
This is just temporary.

12:19.608 --> 12:20.914
Besides, Liam has been
with him all day.

12:20.957 --> 12:23.438
I bet he can't wait to drop
junior off with his mom,

12:23.481 --> 12:26.223
so we can get back to our
regularly scheduled programming.

12:26.267 --> 12:27.311
Well, here comes
daddy now.

12:27.355 --> 12:29.226
No, no, no.
Don't do that, mm-mm.

12:30.880 --> 12:31.968
Hey.
Hey.

12:32.012 --> 12:33.361
Hey, so, we're a little late,

12:33.404 --> 12:34.797
but I think if we...Wow!

12:34.841 --> 12:36.233
You look amazing.

12:36.277 --> 12:37.408
Which is upsetting.

12:37.452 --> 12:38.975
Just tell me the bad news.

12:39.019 --> 12:40.281
Heidi got held up in Savannah.

12:40.324 --> 12:41.499
I have to
watch Connor

12:41.543 --> 12:42.762
for a few more hours
till she gets back.

12:42.805 --> 12:45.373
Seriously? I mean,
can't somebody else do it?

12:45.416 --> 12:48.245
Like who? I'm the only
reason he's here, Fallon.

12:48.289 --> 12:49.290
Besides, he's already
up in the suite

12:49.333 --> 12:50.770
playing with his Magna-Tiles.

12:50.813 --> 12:51.814
All right, we're just gonna
watch Adventure Time

12:51.858 --> 12:53.120
until Heidi gets back.

12:53.163 --> 12:54.251
I don't know what
any of those words mean.

12:54.295 --> 12:56.210
I'll see you later?

12:56.253 --> 12:57.515
Okay, that's fine, I guess.

12:57.559 --> 12:59.256
Just let me know
when the kid's gone.

12:59.300 --> 13:01.432
Come here.
Okay.

13:06.481 --> 13:07.787
He canceled
on you, right?

13:07.830 --> 13:09.179
I can read body language.Hmm.

13:09.223 --> 13:10.180
Yes, he did.

13:10.224 --> 13:12.574
He has to go
babysit Connor.

13:12.617 --> 13:15.925
You know, this kid is really
screwing with my weekend.

13:15.969 --> 13:17.971
You're lucky if it's
only one weekend.

13:18.014 --> 13:20.887
He and mini-Liam are
practically inseparable.

13:20.930 --> 13:22.976
You'd better make sure
this kid likes you.

13:23.019 --> 13:24.325
Why?

13:24.368 --> 13:25.848
If daddy has to choose between

13:25.892 --> 13:27.589
his child and his bride-to-be,

13:27.632 --> 13:29.417
it's really
no contest.

13:29.460 --> 13:31.506
I should know.

13:38.730 --> 13:40.732
Whoa, uh...

13:40.776 --> 13:42.734
Sorry, I didn't
order any of this.

13:42.778 --> 13:44.345
But I did.

13:44.388 --> 13:45.433
Right there, boys.

13:45.476 --> 13:47.304
That's good, thank you.

13:47.348 --> 13:48.740
Whew!

13:48.784 --> 13:50.699
Two is company...

13:50.742 --> 13:52.788
but three's a party!

13:59.882 --> 14:02.276
Who are these for?They're for you, silly.

14:02.319 --> 14:05.061
Why?
Why not? You've been
doing great in school, right?

14:05.105 --> 14:09.457
Not really, I didn't do too good
on my last vocabulary test.

14:09.500 --> 14:10.806
Was the word "ungrateful" on it?

14:10.850 --> 14:12.503
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
Play with the toys.

14:12.547 --> 14:13.635
It'll be fun.

14:13.678 --> 14:15.550
Fallon, what the
hell's going on?

14:15.593 --> 14:16.812
Language!

14:16.856 --> 14:19.510
Well, you two have been
having so much fun,

14:19.554 --> 14:21.817
that I decided this is
where the party was.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.471
I want to get to know your son.

14:23.514 --> 14:25.386
I thought the three of us could
have a little game night.

14:25.429 --> 14:26.735
Wow, that's very considerate.

14:26.778 --> 14:28.389
I am totally on board

14:28.432 --> 14:29.912
with everything
that's happening here.

14:29.956 --> 14:31.827
So, let's just go
play some games, okay?

14:35.439 --> 14:37.354
Aw, pay up.

14:37.398 --> 14:38.573
Thank you.

I want you as far away

You don't want to open
that can of worms, Blake.

Hey, hey, we're not done here.

a problem.

Oh, no, no, not at all.

16:15.061 --> 16:16.497
We had a
lot of fun.

16:16.540 --> 16:19.543
Well,
I bet you are exhausted.

16:19.587 --> 16:22.894
And you probably have a really
early flight home tomorrow so...

16:22.938 --> 16:24.113
Well, actually, I
postponed our flight.

16:24.157 --> 16:25.201
Savannah didn't work out,

16:25.245 --> 16:26.246
but I got an interview

16:26.289 --> 16:27.508
for a job here in Atlanta.

16:27.551 --> 16:29.640
It's not my dream
advertising job, but it

16:29.684 --> 16:31.294
pays well, and I don't know,

16:31.338 --> 16:32.556
I'm really considering it.

16:32.600 --> 16:34.036
Well, that seems pretty
reckless, I mean,

16:34.080 --> 16:36.734
don't you think? Atlanta schools
are-- they're terrible.

16:36.778 --> 16:38.040
Tell her, Liam.

16:38.084 --> 16:40.564
Tell her how terrible
they are.

16:40.608 --> 16:42.305
Uh...

16:43.437 --> 16:45.569
You know what,
why don't you two

16:45.613 --> 16:46.962
come to the engagement party
tomorrow night

16:47.006 --> 16:48.572
and we can talk about
being in Atlanta.

16:48.616 --> 16:50.313
You know, the pros and cons.We'd love that.

DUSTIN: Stephanie.
Glad you could make it.

17:00.236 --> 17:01.629

something to drink?

STEPHANIE:
Let's get right to it, shall we?

17:03.457 --> 17:05.546
I have another meeting.

Jeff?

17:14.294 --> 17:17.210
Adam, what are you
doing here?

17:17.253 --> 17:20.561
Just going over some paperwork
for the C.A. acquisition.

17:20.604 --> 17:22.084
Did Jeff ask you to do that?

17:22.128 --> 17:24.043
You know, when you
say it like that,

17:24.086 --> 17:26.523
it almost sounds
like you don't trust me.

17:26.567 --> 17:28.003
Do you?
Do you trust me?

17:28.047 --> 17:30.049
You're acting
weirder than usual.

17:30.092 --> 17:31.833
What's going on?

17:31.876 --> 17:33.661
Everything's fine.

17:35.489 --> 17:37.012
I guess I thought
we were finally

17:37.056 --> 17:38.448
being honest with each other.

17:38.492 --> 17:40.363
We are.But you think
I didn't need to know

17:40.407 --> 17:42.452
that Jeff is sick
and getting worse every day?

17:42.496 --> 17:44.628
That wasn't my secret to tell.

17:44.672 --> 17:46.630
Especially when you're
the one who poisoned him

17:46.674 --> 17:47.936
in the first place.

17:47.979 --> 17:49.329
I apologized for poisoning him!

17:49.372 --> 17:51.200
And then I recorded
that confession!

17:51.244 --> 17:53.681
I have proven my loyalty to you
many times over,

17:53.724 --> 17:55.596
and yet, you still
treat me like a...

17:55.639 --> 17:57.772
a pawn in this game
against my father.

17:57.815 --> 17:59.730
Maybe I chose the wrong side.Adam.

17:59.774 --> 18:01.602
Wait!

18:01.645 --> 18:03.952
Look, I got to be honest,
Dominique's antics

18:03.995 --> 18:07.129
drove Monica out of the state,
so I'm not exactly leaping

18:07.173 --> 18:10.480
at the opportunity to sign
her client/fake daughter.

18:10.524 --> 18:11.742
I get it.

18:11.786 --> 18:14.093
Dom can be difficult,
but Vanessa is not.

18:14.136 --> 18:16.878
She's talented,
she's dedicated...

18:16.921 --> 18:18.053
we've been seeing each other.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.054
Oh!

18:19.098 --> 18:20.664
Okay, I get it.

18:20.708 --> 18:22.536
You did something wrong
and you're trying

18:22.579 --> 18:24.103
to make it up to her. See?

18:24.146 --> 18:25.974
I told you when we were dating
you needed to be more

18:26.017 --> 18:28.107
communicative.Look, I'm being serious, Fallon.

18:28.150 --> 18:29.673
And I thought you were
already gonna sign her.

18:29.717 --> 18:31.762
I was, I was,
I just, you know,

18:31.806 --> 18:33.677
I wanted to see Dominique beg,
a little, but it's fine.

18:33.721 --> 18:35.114
We can make it official.

18:35.157 --> 18:37.333
Ah, so Vanessa's been
missing out on opportunities

18:37.377 --> 18:39.248
while you were busy
being vindictive?

18:39.292 --> 18:41.163
Well, it sounds bad
when you say it like that.

18:41.207 --> 18:44.079
What if... I let her sing
at my engagement party?

18:44.123 --> 18:45.689
Would that help?

18:45.733 --> 18:48.214
Ah, so John Mayer
backed out, huh?

18:48.257 --> 18:49.476
Oh, he's such a flake.

18:49.519 --> 18:51.042
I hate his stupid,
baggy clothes.

18:51.086 --> 18:53.480
Vanessa will be thrilled.

18:53.523 --> 18:55.134
Oh, and a word of warning,

18:55.177 --> 18:56.570
steer clear
of Dominique.

18:56.613 --> 18:58.876
Hmm, trust me... I know.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.618
I wish she would've
just found fame and fortune

19:01.662 --> 19:03.403
in New York
and then stayed there.

19:03.446 --> 19:05.013
We all know she
didn't move to Atlanta

19:05.056 --> 19:07.015
to be closer
to her kids.

19:07.058 --> 19:08.277
You're right.

19:08.321 --> 19:09.757
Because deep down,

19:09.800 --> 19:12.455
everyone is selfish.

19:12.499 --> 19:14.588
Including Heidi.

19:14.631 --> 19:16.155

You look good, too.

Have you seen Connor
or Heidi yet?

19:43.356 --> 19:46.097
I have not,
but I will definitely

19:46.141 --> 19:47.621
be keeping an eye out
for them.

19:47.664 --> 19:50.537
Oh, God, there's my Aunt Jocelyn
and her fifth husband.

19:50.580 --> 19:53.148

Fallon?

19:58.806 --> 20:00.416
Congratulations.

20:00.460 --> 20:01.765
Your father and I
are so happy for you.

20:01.809 --> 20:03.637
That's nice, but we can
skip the formalities.

20:03.680 --> 20:05.813
I know that Blake is only here
so he can rub elbows

20:05.856 --> 20:08.250
with Liam's relatives
on the VKI board.

20:08.294 --> 20:10.687
I admit that he can
sometimes let a mission get

20:10.731 --> 20:12.254
the best of him,
and I know things

20:12.298 --> 20:14.387
between us haven't been
great since the trial.

20:14.430 --> 20:16.780
Oh, you mean since you lied
to me about Blake...

20:16.824 --> 20:18.434
killing an innocent man?

20:18.478 --> 20:20.567
At one point,
you and I were getting close.

20:20.610 --> 20:23.004
And considering all the awful
things your real mother

20:23.047 --> 20:25.615
has done, I should've
been kinder to you.

20:25.659 --> 20:27.574
You deserve better.
I'm sorry.

20:27.617 --> 20:29.924
Well, I appreciate
the sentiment, but Alexis

20:29.967 --> 20:33.449
has actually been
less awful lately.

20:33.493 --> 20:36.278
Maybe it's more than
just a phase this time.

20:36.322 --> 20:38.149
Fingers crossed.

how much I care... ♪

20:40.674 --> 20:42.632
STACEY: Uh, excuse me,
Ms. Carrington?

20:42.676 --> 20:44.243
Just wanted to say
thank you for inviting me.

20:44.286 --> 20:46.245
Congratulations
to you and your fiancé.

20:46.288 --> 20:48.290
Oh, that would mean
so much more to me

20:48.334 --> 20:49.770
if I had any idea who you were.

20:49.813 --> 20:51.728
Are you one of Liam's friends?

20:51.772 --> 20:54.557
Actually, she's a friend
of mine. Fallon...

20:54.601 --> 20:55.819
I don't want to.

20:55.863 --> 20:58.474
Thank you for
believing in Vanessa.

20:58.518 --> 21:01.695
We are thrilled to be a part of
Broken Glass Recording Artists.

21:01.738 --> 21:04.698
"We"? I don't remember
you signing anything.

21:06.526 --> 21:08.484
So yousent the invite.

21:08.528 --> 21:10.486
Tricks aren't gonna
close the deal.

21:10.530 --> 21:13.272
And I'm still waiting to see
some footage of Cristal.

21:13.315 --> 21:15.317
Now that Vanessa's
moving into the manor,

21:15.361 --> 21:18.189
it's going to be impossible for
Cristal to avoid the cameras.

21:18.233 --> 21:20.191
And once you hear
Vanessa sing,

21:20.235 --> 21:22.324
you're going to forget
all about her anyway.

21:22.368 --> 21:24.326
Vanessa's the real star.

21:34.858 --> 21:36.556
You haven't seen
your ex-wife around, have you?

21:36.599 --> 21:38.035
No. No, why?

21:38.079 --> 21:40.168
Since she has tried to kill me,
I just like to be aware

21:40.211 --> 21:41.387
when she's in shooting range.

21:41.430 --> 21:42.649
Well, you don't have
to worry about that.

21:42.692 --> 21:43.867
What do you mean?

21:43.911 --> 21:45.042
She's not coming?

21:45.086 --> 21:46.870
I know how difficult
it's been for you,

21:46.914 --> 21:48.959
being around her given
everything that's happened,

21:49.003 --> 21:52.180
so... I warned Alexis
to stay away.

21:52.223 --> 21:54.704
She's not gonna show
her face here tonight.

22:03.757 --> 22:04.758
Aw...

22:04.801 --> 22:06.542
Who is that
a photo of?

22:06.586 --> 22:07.630
What do you mean?

22:07.674 --> 22:08.936
Well, I mean it's not me.

22:08.979 --> 22:10.416
It's not Liam.

22:10.459 --> 22:13.506
Maybe Liam was just
a very dark-haired child.

22:14.898 --> 22:17.292
Okay, fine, I didn't have time
to get baby pics of him,

22:17.336 --> 22:18.685
so I used some of mine.

22:18.728 --> 22:20.208
But I mean,
how cute was I?

22:20.251 --> 22:21.340
Hold that thought.

22:22.732 --> 22:24.778
Here, here, here. Hey!

22:24.821 --> 22:26.823
I am so glad
you guys could make it.

22:26.867 --> 22:28.129
Fallon, hi.

22:28.172 --> 22:29.609
This is for you and Liam.

22:29.652 --> 22:31.480
Oh.It's a candle.

22:31.524 --> 22:33.352
I couldn't afford anything
on your registry.

22:33.395 --> 22:35.049
Actually, Ihave a gift for you.

22:35.092 --> 22:36.224
Sort of.

22:37.225 --> 22:39.401
I wasn't really looking
for a date.

22:39.445 --> 22:40.750
No, no, no.
No, he's not.

22:40.794 --> 22:43.492
Heidi, this is my old
friend, Luke Tennant.

22:43.536 --> 22:45.059
Luke has an
advertising agency,

22:45.102 --> 22:48.279
and he is desperately in need
of a new graphic designer

22:48.323 --> 22:50.325
to join his team
in San Diego.

22:50.369 --> 22:52.153
And I told him you would
be absolutely perfect

22:52.196 --> 22:54.851
for the position.Wow. I...
I'm-I'm flattered.

22:54.895 --> 22:57.463
But we were really considering
giving Atlanta a try.

22:57.506 --> 22:59.813
I mean, we just got here.Listen, why
don't you

22:59.856 --> 23:02.337
just talk to him, let him tell
you all about your dream job,

23:02.381 --> 23:04.905
and I'll take Connor
to go get some punch.

23:04.948 --> 23:07.124
Well, okay...

23:07.168 --> 23:08.430
Go talk. Go talk.

23:08.474 --> 23:09.692
Okay. Okay.

23:09.736 --> 23:10.954
So?

23:13.000 --> 23:14.958
DUSTIN : Stephanie.
Glad you could make it.

23:15.002 --> 23:16.917
Can I offer you
something to drink?

23:16.960 --> 23:18.832
That is the current CEO
of Carrington Atlantic

23:18.875 --> 23:20.834
bribing the
regulations enforcer

23:20.877 --> 23:22.618
of the Department of
Natural Resources.

23:22.662 --> 23:24.838
If this gets out,
it's gonna ruin him,

23:24.881 --> 23:26.883
and now you have
it, not Jeff.

23:26.927 --> 23:30.060
You can tell him all about
it when you bid for C.A.Well done.

23:30.104 --> 23:31.366
Great job.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.368
You can have it...

23:33.412 --> 23:35.109
but I want something
in return.

23:35.152 --> 23:36.284
I'm listening.

23:36.327 --> 23:38.460
Your seat on the
board of directors

23:38.504 --> 23:39.853
at Atlanta General.

23:39.896 --> 23:41.507
You're gonna be
busy running C.A.,

23:41.550 --> 23:43.291
and I want to practice
medicine again.

23:43.334 --> 23:45.249
A board position, it
guarantees me job security

23:45.293 --> 23:46.642
and some power there.

23:46.686 --> 23:48.078
That's the deal.

23:50.994 --> 23:53.083
Well, I'm proud of you, son.

23:53.127 --> 23:56.304
Never give a valuable commodity
away for free.

23:56.347 --> 23:57.653
Well, I learned
from the best.

23:57.697 --> 23:59.742
I'll make the phone call
right now.

23:59.786 --> 24:02.049
And then we
will have a drink.

24:02.092 --> 24:04.138
This is cause
for celebration.

24:04.181 --> 24:05.879
What about Fallon's
engagement?

24:05.922 --> 24:07.968
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That, too. Sure.

24:10.057 --> 24:11.885
Michael.

24:11.928 --> 24:14.235
So nice to see you.

24:14.278 --> 24:15.889
Wish I could say the same.

24:15.932 --> 24:17.107
Can I get you anything?

24:17.151 --> 24:18.848
A drink? A record deal?

24:18.892 --> 24:20.850
My kidney?

24:20.894 --> 24:23.287
What's this about?You know exactly
what this is about.

24:23.331 --> 24:25.638
If you plan on holding our
mistake over my head forever,

24:25.681 --> 24:27.640
maybe I should just
rip the Band-Aid off--

24:27.683 --> 24:28.815
tell Vanessa what happened.

24:28.858 --> 24:30.294
Have you lost your mind?

24:30.338 --> 24:32.427
Vanessa finding out
about our drunken hookup

24:32.471 --> 24:35.082
is the last thing anyone wants.

24:36.213 --> 24:37.606
And there she is.

24:37.650 --> 24:39.303
Aw. Hi, sweetheart.

24:39.347 --> 24:40.957
How are you feeling?

24:41.001 --> 24:43.438
Nervous, but excited.

24:44.657 --> 24:47.050
You two look fantastic.

24:47.094 --> 24:49.009
Squeeze in.

24:49.052 --> 24:50.619
Let's get a photograph

24:50.663 --> 24:52.926
of Atlanta's latest
power couple.

24:55.711 --> 24:57.060
SAM:
Hey, buddy.

24:57.104 --> 24:58.975
Should he really be playing
with that?

24:59.019 --> 25:01.021
Don't worry,
it's not the good stuff.

25:01.064 --> 25:03.327
Did you tell Vanessa
she could perform here tonight?Yes.

25:03.371 --> 25:05.765
Well, John Mayer is dead to me,
and now that Vanessa

25:05.808 --> 25:07.984
is on my label,
I thought any publicity helps.

25:08.028 --> 25:09.682
Well, a little notice
would have been nice.

25:09.725 --> 25:12.946
Now I have to rethink
the introduction.

25:12.989 --> 25:14.121
LIAM:
Fallon.

25:14.164 --> 25:15.731
Can I talk to you for a minute?

25:15.775 --> 25:17.385
Please?Yeah.

25:17.428 --> 25:21.563
Did you ask a friend of yours to
offer Heidi a job in California?

25:21.607 --> 25:24.174
Well, she said she needed work.In Atlanta.

25:24.218 --> 25:26.481
Well, excuse me for trying to do
something nice for someone.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.004
I knew there was a reason
I didn't do

25:28.048 --> 25:29.179
that kind of thing more often.

25:29.223 --> 25:30.790
You weren't being nice.

25:30.833 --> 25:33.183
You were trying to send her back
to California, because what,

25:33.227 --> 25:34.881
you're jealous
of a ten-year-old?

25:34.924 --> 25:37.231
I'm not jealous.
I was trying...

25:37.274 --> 25:39.059
to do what was best for us--

25:39.102 --> 25:41.583
something that you clearly
do not care about anymore.

25:41.627 --> 25:43.498
WOMAN: Ow!

25:43.542 --> 25:44.630
Sorry.

25:44.673 --> 25:46.588
Who gave the child alcohol?

25:46.632 --> 25:48.634
I can't deal with
this right now.

25:48.677 --> 25:50.418
Hey, buddy,
can I see that?

25:50.461 --> 25:51.593
Come on.

25:51.637 --> 25:52.725
Let's go find your mom.

25:52.768 --> 25:53.769
SAM:
Hello,

25:53.813 --> 25:55.031
everyone!

25:55.075 --> 25:58.905
Welcome to Fallon and Liam's
engagement party.

25:58.948 --> 26:00.559
Or retying-the-knot party.

26:00.602 --> 26:01.951
Anyway, you get it,

26:01.995 --> 26:03.518
they are getting married.

26:03.562 --> 26:06.129
And I want to welcome
the happy couple to...

26:06.173 --> 26:07.914
to, uh...

26:07.957 --> 26:09.524
to enjoy some music!

26:09.568 --> 26:10.917
So, why don't we all

26:10.960 --> 26:13.180
travel back in time
to the opening of this hotel

26:13.223 --> 26:16.749
just a few months ago,
when a little-known bartendress

26:16.792 --> 26:18.794
randomly sang us a song.

26:18.838 --> 26:22.668
Back by popular-ish demand,

26:22.711 --> 26:24.365
please put your hands together

26:24.408 --> 26:26.367
for Vanessa...

26:26.410 --> 26:29.065
Deveraux!

26:36.072 --> 26:38.248
I would like to dedicate

Yes, your daughter

27:23.729 --> 27:26.079
has a great sound, but...

27:26.122 --> 27:29.212
I'm afraid we're gonna have
to pass on the project.

27:29.256 --> 27:30.736
What?I'm sorry,

27:30.779 --> 27:32.041
but it's not for us.

27:32.085 --> 27:33.477
Why the hell not?

27:33.521 --> 27:37.133
I got you access to the
Carringtons like you wanted.

27:37.177 --> 27:41.355
And... a talented
soon-to-be pop star.Look,

27:41.398 --> 27:43.618
people don't watch these shows
to see talent.

27:43.662 --> 27:45.272
They watch them
to see celebrities

27:48.188 --> 27:51.713
You and your daughter aren't

There's no drama,
no scandal,

27:53.802 --> 27:55.717
not even with the Carringtons.

27:55.761 --> 27:57.153
Sorry.

27:57.197 --> 27:58.589
♪ To me.

28:05.335 --> 28:09.035
I told Jeff we needed
to put in a moat.

28:11.777 --> 28:14.431
Blake told me he asked you
not to come tonight.

28:14.475 --> 28:17.304
Yes, uninviting me
to my own daughter's engagement,

28:17.347 --> 28:19.698
a party I basically planned.

28:19.741 --> 28:22.265
Just when you think
he couldn't stoop any lower.

28:22.309 --> 28:23.353
He was wrong.

28:23.397 --> 28:24.703
You should be there.

28:24.746 --> 28:27.140
Fallon still cares about
you for some reason,

28:27.183 --> 28:30.447
and I care about her,
so I'll make sure it's okay.

28:30.491 --> 28:31.927
I'm sure it's too late.

28:31.971 --> 28:33.581
The party is probably over.

28:33.624 --> 28:36.149
Actually, I've barely seen
Fallon and Liam, so...

28:36.192 --> 28:38.891
I think there's plenty of time
left to enjoy the festivities.

28:38.934 --> 28:40.806
That's very big of you, Cristal.

28:40.849 --> 28:43.765
I guess there is
an ounce of decency

28:43.809 --> 28:46.246
underneath that veneer of evil.

28:46.289 --> 28:47.160
Thank you?

28:47.203 --> 28:48.639
I'll go get dressed.

28:48.683 --> 28:50.250
You know the way out.

29:03.263 --> 29:05.395
VANESSA: So that's
Broken Glass Recording Artists,

29:05.439 --> 29:07.702
but you can catch the single
on my website.

29:24.023 --> 29:25.981
What's going on?

29:29.768 --> 29:30.812
Vanessa,

29:30.856 --> 29:32.292
I-I-I can explain.

29:38.167 --> 29:39.908
How dare you!

29:39.952 --> 29:41.649
Sweetie,
it's not what it looks like.

29:41.692 --> 29:43.738
I-I mean, it is,
but let me explain...

29:43.782 --> 29:46.219
After all of that crap
about how you thought of me

29:46.262 --> 29:48.874
as your own child,
you go and screw my boyfriend?!

29:48.917 --> 29:50.963
You have every right
to be angry,

29:51.006 --> 29:54.183
but it was never my intention
to hurt you.MICHAEL: You filmed me

29:54.227 --> 29:56.316
without my consent--
I should have you arrested!

29:56.359 --> 29:58.666
I'm sorry, are you feeling
a little betrayed right now?

29:58.709 --> 29:59.710
Vanessa, it was...

29:59.754 --> 30:01.800
Save it!

30:01.843 --> 30:03.976
I am done with both of you.

30:09.677 --> 30:11.200
There you are.

30:11.244 --> 30:15.204
"Momager cheats
with pop singer daughter's

30:15.248 --> 30:16.379
loaded boyfriend."

30:16.423 --> 30:17.903
Now, that's the kind
of drama I meant.

30:17.946 --> 30:19.513
This is a reality show.

30:19.556 --> 30:22.951
I'm glad my weakness for men
with abs makes you giddy.

30:22.995 --> 30:24.866
Well, your weakness
is now your strength.

30:24.910 --> 30:27.042
Consider your show sold.

30:27.086 --> 30:28.652
I'll have contracts
sent over right away.

30:28.696 --> 30:31.525
And I'll have my lawyer look
over your offer and consider it.

30:31.568 --> 30:34.180
Consider? We've
been negotiating for weeks.

30:34.223 --> 30:36.399
And I imagine
I'll be considering offers

30:36.443 --> 30:37.400
from multiple networks now.

30:37.444 --> 30:39.402
You'll just have to get in line.

30:43.232 --> 30:44.799
JEFF:
Blake.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.975
You remember Jamison Van Kirk.

30:47.019 --> 30:48.585
We were just discussing
my acquisition

30:48.629 --> 30:51.240
of a little company
that VKI purchased last year.

30:51.284 --> 30:53.852
I'm surprised to see
that you're still here

30:53.895 --> 30:56.245
after your mother's
adult film debut.

30:56.289 --> 30:57.856
Well, she is your sister.

30:57.899 --> 31:00.206
Half. Uh, would
you excuse us?

31:00.249 --> 31:02.208
Jamison and
I need to...

31:02.251 --> 31:06.255
talk over the sale of my company
back to its rightful owner-- me.

31:06.299 --> 31:07.822
Y-You know what,
I'm out of punch.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.302
I think I'll just go...

31:09.345 --> 31:11.347
If you're referring
to the soon-to-be-renamed

31:11.391 --> 31:12.783
Carrington Atlantic,
last I checked,

31:12.827 --> 31:15.047
my bid is the only one
being considered.

31:15.090 --> 31:16.309
Well, not for long.

31:16.352 --> 31:17.571
Did you really think

31:17.614 --> 31:19.529
that you could turn my own son
against me?

31:19.573 --> 31:21.967
No. But I could.

31:22.010 --> 31:23.055
What is this?

31:23.098 --> 31:24.447
What the hell
are you doing here?

31:24.491 --> 31:27.363
Don't worry, it'll all
be clear very soon.

31:27.407 --> 31:29.365
You couldn't come up
with your own blackmail,

31:29.409 --> 31:30.845
so you tried
to steal mine?

31:30.889 --> 31:33.239
I mean, wow, you have
really lost your touch.
No,

31:33.282 --> 31:34.849
I haven't lost anything.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.851
Adam gave me your recording.

31:36.895 --> 31:39.462
Yeah, I'm the one
with the power here.ADAM: You sure?

31:39.506 --> 31:41.725
You might want to listen
to the full recording.

31:41.769 --> 31:45.294
You see, at first, your offer
to come back was enticing.

31:45.338 --> 31:46.774
Then Mother
quickly made me realize

31:46.817 --> 31:49.037
that you'd turn on me.

31:49.081 --> 31:50.952
So instead, I told her
and Jeff everything,

31:50.996 --> 31:53.868
and together, we devised
our own scheme. But hey.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.565
Thanks for the seat
on the hospital board.

31:55.609 --> 31:57.437
How could you double-cross me
like this?

31:57.480 --> 32:00.396
Like I said, I learned
from the best.

32:00.440 --> 32:01.876
SAM:
Hey.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.313
Where's Liam? It's time
for the couple's toast.Oh.

32:04.357 --> 32:06.489
Well, that's gonna have to be
postponed. Indefinitely.

32:06.533 --> 32:08.317
Liam is off somewhere
with his son.

32:08.361 --> 32:10.450
You know, I guess. I don't know.
We had a fight.

32:10.493 --> 32:12.147
Listen, I don't want
to automatically assume

32:12.191 --> 32:14.149
that it was your fault,
but I assume it was your fault?

32:14.193 --> 32:15.368
ALEXIS:
There you are.

32:15.411 --> 32:17.109
My daughter is getting married.

32:17.152 --> 32:18.240
Again.

32:18.284 --> 32:19.938
I am so excited
for this wedding.

32:19.981 --> 32:21.287
I have so many ideas.

32:21.330 --> 32:23.985
No. No, I don't want
any more advice from you.

32:24.029 --> 32:25.421
This is all your fault.What's my fault?

32:25.465 --> 32:26.683
I think I've been an angel.

32:26.727 --> 32:28.729
Oh, really? If you hadn't gotten
into my head

32:28.772 --> 32:30.165
about Liam and Connor,

32:30.209 --> 32:32.298
then maybe my fiancé and I
would actually be speaking

32:32.341 --> 32:34.648
and this wouldn't be
the worst engagement party ever.

32:34.691 --> 32:36.215
When we blame others,

32:36.258 --> 32:38.957
it's usually because we're
afraid to look in the mirror.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.480
The only time
I'm afraid to look in the mirror

32:40.523 --> 32:42.525
is when you are standing
behind me.

32:42.569 --> 32:44.571
Well, if you want me to
go, then I'll just...Yes.

32:44.614 --> 32:46.051
Please. I want you to go.

32:46.094 --> 32:48.053
I don't know why
I ever took advice from you.

32:48.096 --> 32:50.664
As if you have any idea
how to keep a family together.

32:50.707 --> 32:52.535
Fine.

32:52.579 --> 32:53.972
I'll get my gift bag and go.

32:56.017 --> 32:57.105
Can you believe

32:57.149 --> 32:58.454
I ever listened to her?

32:58.498 --> 32:59.629
No.

32:59.673 --> 33:01.762
I also can't believe
you didn't ask me.

33:01.805 --> 33:04.025
I mean, the guy who grew up
without a father

33:04.069 --> 33:05.592
and always felt
this void in my life.

33:05.635 --> 33:07.376
Listen, right now Connor

33:07.420 --> 33:09.726
needs a dad a lot more
than you need a fiancé.

33:09.770 --> 33:10.989
And if you love Liam,

33:11.032 --> 33:12.512
you need to do
what's best for him,

33:12.555 --> 33:14.122
not you.

33:14.166 --> 33:15.645
Fine.

33:15.689 --> 33:17.299
Great.

33:17.343 --> 33:19.823
Now, do you really think this is
the worst engagement party ever?

33:19.867 --> 33:21.260
Liam and I aren't speaking,

33:21.303 --> 33:23.740
I'm almost positive Connor
blinded one of the guests,

33:23.784 --> 33:26.134
and everyone here just
watched a sex tape

33:26.178 --> 33:28.963
starring my ex-fiancé
and my half aunt.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.834
Yeah. This sucks.

33:41.193 --> 33:43.543
WOMAN:
Cristal. Hi!

34:13.355 --> 34:15.314
Hi.

34:15.357 --> 34:16.967
Hey.

34:19.013 --> 34:20.362
This is the part
where I apologize

34:20.406 --> 34:22.277
for acting like
a total lunatic.

34:23.322 --> 34:25.106
I'm listening.

34:28.153 --> 34:30.111
I'm sorry, Liam.

34:30.155 --> 34:31.678
I panicked.
All of a sudden,

34:31.721 --> 34:33.332
you had this new family,

34:33.375 --> 34:35.899
and I started to worry
that maybe I

34:35.943 --> 34:37.510
wouldn't fit in anymore.Fallon.

34:37.553 --> 34:41.122
But I had no right to get
between you and your son, okay?

34:41.166 --> 34:42.428
I'm just gonna have to...

34:42.471 --> 34:45.170
hope that you have
enough love to go around.

34:45.213 --> 34:47.346
I appreciate the apology.

34:47.389 --> 34:50.262
But if I'm being honest,

34:50.305 --> 34:53.439
I'm not sure I can do this.

34:54.222 --> 34:55.963
Okay.

34:56.006 --> 34:58.052
That seems a little extreme.
I know I messed up,

34:58.096 --> 35:00.141
but I do feel like
we can work through this.

35:00.185 --> 35:02.491
No. No, no, no, no.
Hey, hey. Not us.

35:02.535 --> 35:05.407
I mean I don't think
I can be a father.

35:05.451 --> 35:07.279
So you don't want
them to stay?

35:07.322 --> 35:09.977
I mean, I've been trying to
play it cool for Connor's sake,

35:10.020 --> 35:12.022
but I've been freaking out
since they showed up.

35:12.066 --> 35:13.502
Well, you could've fooled me.

35:13.546 --> 35:15.461
I thought the two of you
were already bonded for life.

35:15.504 --> 35:17.071
He seems great.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.726
But I never wanted kids.

35:19.769 --> 35:21.728
And now I feel like
it's my responsibility

35:21.771 --> 35:24.296
to be a good parent.
I'm not even sure I know how.

35:24.339 --> 35:26.298
I mean, it's not like
I had any training.

35:26.341 --> 35:29.127
My own mother
didn't even show up tonight.Oh, well,

35:29.170 --> 35:30.998
Cristal and Alexis
are both here.

35:31.041 --> 35:33.609
You can have either one
of them if you want.

35:35.655 --> 35:37.483
I know this isn't
what you signed up for

35:37.526 --> 35:39.746
when you agreed to marry me.

35:39.789 --> 35:41.704
But this is my problem
to deal with.

35:41.748 --> 35:44.272
No, it's not. No.

35:44.316 --> 35:46.187
No, this is our problem.

35:46.231 --> 35:49.451
Okay? And it's not like
it's gonna be full-time.

35:49.495 --> 35:50.887
Heidi seems like
a good mom,

35:50.931 --> 35:52.454
and you'll be
a great dad.

35:52.498 --> 35:54.282
And I will...

35:54.326 --> 35:56.328
I will be
an interesting stepmother.

35:56.371 --> 35:59.418
I can't make any promises.
I don't know.

35:59.461 --> 36:01.550
Fair enough.

36:01.594 --> 36:03.639
Come on.

36:03.683 --> 36:06.207
Let's go out there,

36:06.251 --> 36:08.209
tell everyone how much
we love each other

36:08.253 --> 36:10.472
and shut
this party down.

36:10.516 --> 36:12.082
Deal.

36:40.589 --> 36:42.591
FALLON:
Hello, everyone.

36:42.635 --> 36:44.071
If you don't mind,

36:44.114 --> 36:45.681
I would like to say a few words

36:45.725 --> 36:48.206
about the man
I cannot wait to marry.

36:48.249 --> 36:49.555
Again.

36:49.598 --> 36:51.992
Liam, it's been a rocky road.

36:52.035 --> 36:53.994
We've dealt with more
than some couples do

36:54.037 --> 36:55.604
in a lifetime, and we made it,

36:55.648 --> 36:57.519
which I think
is pretty impressive.

36:57.563 --> 37:00.261
I love that no matter what
life throws at us,

37:00.305 --> 37:02.263
you always have my back.

37:02.307 --> 37:04.570
And I will always have
your back.

37:04.613 --> 37:06.572
You are the love of my life.

37:09.879 --> 37:12.752
LIAM:
And, uh, thank you all so much

37:12.795 --> 37:14.362
for being here to celebrate
with us tonight.

37:14.406 --> 37:16.364
Oh! Oh, oh, oh.
Oh, and I know

37:16.408 --> 37:19.541
that some of you
were at our divorce party.

37:19.585 --> 37:21.195
Well, truthfully,
that was just for show.

37:21.239 --> 37:22.588
But this is the real deal.

37:22.631 --> 37:24.242
And to quote

37:24.285 --> 37:26.331
Liam's favorite band,

37:26.374 --> 37:28.681
Starship, formerly known
as Jefferson Starship,

37:28.724 --> 37:30.204
"Nothing's gonna stop us now."

37:30.248 --> 37:31.379
I wouldn't say
it's my favorite band.

37:54.402 --> 37:56.404
Someone call 911!

38:01.801 --> 38:04.369
The doctors say your burns
are mostly second-degree,

38:04.412 --> 38:05.718
that you'll make
a full recovery.

38:05.761 --> 38:07.546
I guess it just feels
like I'm dying.

38:12.072 --> 38:13.421
What's wrong?

38:13.465 --> 38:15.771
The fire department cleaned
up and left the scene.

38:15.815 --> 38:18.426
It's being reported as an
accident for now, but...

38:18.470 --> 38:21.864
They won't find anything
that can lead them back to us.

38:21.908 --> 38:23.649
I made sure of that.

38:23.692 --> 38:26.260
We're safe.I'm so sorry, Beto.

38:26.304 --> 38:27.696
This is all my fault.

38:27.740 --> 38:30.046
If I hadn't...Hey, hey, I'm all right.

38:30.090 --> 38:31.570
Tell your husband I said thanks

38:31.613 --> 38:33.528
for putting me up
in his hospital.

38:33.572 --> 38:34.616
Blake doesn't know.

38:34.660 --> 38:36.923
He'd already left the party.

38:36.966 --> 38:39.534
And he's not gonna find
out if I can help it.

38:42.581 --> 38:44.365
I have nothing else
to say to you.

38:46.019 --> 38:48.587
Good. Then you can just listen.

38:50.980 --> 38:52.939
You may not see it now,

38:52.982 --> 38:54.854
but everything I did,
I did for you.

38:54.897 --> 38:56.899
Everything or everyone?

38:56.943 --> 38:58.814
You're signed
to Fallon's record label,

38:58.858 --> 39:02.078
have a room waiting for you
at Carrington Manor,

39:02.122 --> 39:04.298
and after
that little fiasco tonight,

39:04.342 --> 39:05.821
you're trending
on Twitter.

39:05.865 --> 39:07.954
With all that publicity,

39:07.997 --> 39:10.478
I was able to sell

39:10.522 --> 39:12.698
House of Deveraux.

39:13.699 --> 39:15.135
You're going to be a star.

39:15.178 --> 39:16.397
You sold the show?

39:16.441 --> 39:18.573
Sometimes you have
to sink pretty low

39:18.617 --> 39:20.706
before you can rise to the top.

39:20.749 --> 39:22.098
I said I would do anything

39:22.142 --> 39:24.405
to ensure your success,
and I have.

39:24.449 --> 39:26.668
All right. I'm game.

39:26.712 --> 39:29.671
You can continue to manage
me and play your part,

39:29.715 --> 39:30.803
and I will play mine

39:30.846 --> 39:32.544
by controlling my urge
to strangle you.

39:32.587 --> 39:35.460
Save it for the cameras.
We start filming next week.

39:35.503 --> 39:38.637
And let me know when Culhane
comes crawling back.

39:38.680 --> 39:41.901
I have a few ideas on
how best to handle him.

39:44.686 --> 39:46.645
DUSTIN:
Stephanie.

39:46.688 --> 39:48.037
Glad you could make it.

39:48.081 --> 39:49.474
Can I offer you something
to drink?

39:49.517 --> 39:51.127
STEPHANIE:
Let's get right to it, shall we?

39:51.171 --> 39:52.825
I have another meeting.

39:52.868 --> 39:55.610
My name is Adam Carrington.

39:55.654 --> 39:57.264
I want to confess

39:57.307 --> 40:00.789
that I poisoned Jeff Colby
with the intent to make him sick

40:00.833 --> 40:02.835
or kill him.

40:02.878 --> 40:04.663
And I did so

40:04.706 --> 40:08.754
at the request of my father,
Blake Carrington.

40:09.537 --> 40:11.539
Mother...

40:11.583 --> 40:13.541
ALEXIS:
See what we can accomplish

40:13.585 --> 40:15.238
when we all play nice?

40:15.282 --> 40:16.892
And don't worry.
Blake's not gonna tell anyone

40:16.936 --> 40:18.024
about your condition.

40:18.067 --> 40:19.504
He won't risk
incriminating himself.

40:19.547 --> 40:22.158
Nevertheless,
I'm still surprised that you

40:22.202 --> 40:23.769
betrayed your father.For a while,

40:23.812 --> 40:25.379
I thought I wanted
to be just like Blake.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.903
And then I realized
I could be so much better.

40:27.947 --> 40:29.688
JEFF:
Well, I'm glad you
chose the winning side,

40:29.731 --> 40:30.906
because I just got word

40:30.950 --> 40:32.517
Dustin signed
off on the deal.

40:32.560 --> 40:36.477
As soon as the board
approves, C.A.'s ours.

40:36.521 --> 40:38.697
Gentlemen,

40:38.740 --> 40:40.873
I love when a plan
comes together.

40:40.916 --> 40:43.049
Cheers to that.

40:43.092 --> 40:45.312
Well, tonight got out of
control really quickly.

40:45.355 --> 40:46.705
Least it wasn't my car.

40:46.748 --> 40:48.402
Or our sex tape.

40:48.446 --> 40:50.578
You really are a
"glass half full" type.

40:50.622 --> 40:52.711
As long as the glass
is filled with champagne.

40:52.754 --> 40:55.409
So, that black outfit you
said you incinerated...

40:55.453 --> 40:57.542
Did you really?

40:57.585 --> 40:59.544
Liam.What?

40:59.587 --> 41:01.371
Hey, buddy.

41:02.372 --> 41:04.418
Uh, what are you doing here?

41:04.462 --> 41:05.811
Where's your mom?

41:05.854 --> 41:08.466
She said to wait for you.

41:10.468 --> 41:12.557
Why don't you go play
some video games

41:12.600 --> 41:14.210
for a little while, buddy, okay?

41:16.256 --> 41:18.432
Let me see
if I can reach her.

41:18.476 --> 41:20.478
Oh, Liam. Liam.

41:26.701 --> 41:29.399
"Liam, I love my son,

41:29.443 --> 41:30.575
"but I have sacrificed

41:30.618 --> 41:32.664
"more than I ever thought
to raise him.

41:32.707 --> 41:36.450
I'm sorry, but it's your turn
to be the parent now."

41:38.496 --> 41:40.672
"You and Fallon can provide

41:40.715 --> 41:44.023
"the stable, loving home
I never could.

41:44.066 --> 41:47.069
Please forgive me
and look after our boy."

41:49.637 --> 41:51.334
She's gone.

41:51.378 --> 41:53.815
: Well, what are we
supposed to do with him now?

41:53.859 --> 41:55.295
I...
