10:46.100 --> 10:47.320
Len and I don't--

10:47.320 --> 10:49.040
-Have sex like that?

10:49.040 --> 10:51.960
-Have sex.

10:51.960 --> 10:53.380
-Yeah, me and Barb either.

11:03.210 --> 11:09.160
-So I said, OK, now, now, now--
and I looked down at my hand.

11:09.160 --> 11:12.140
And I was-- my hand was shaking.

11:12.140 --> 11:13.890
And I just said it.

11:13.890 --> 11:16.260
And so, um-- and I'm so sorry.

11:16.260 --> 11:17.130
I surprised her.

11:17.130 --> 11:22.610
It was-- it was-- so
tragically impromptu.

11:22.610 --> 11:23.680
But there you have it.

11:23.680 --> 11:26.230
I mean, it's-- it's done.

11:26.230 --> 11:29.120
And we have one down.

11:29.120 --> 11:30.500
And we have two to go.

11:30.500 --> 11:34.980
And then of course, the
rest of North America.

11:34.980 --> 11:37.120
-Thanks for sharing, Maura.

11:37.120 --> 11:37.820
You did it.

11:37.820 --> 11:40.180
That's all we have
time for today.

11:40.180 --> 11:43.100
Remember to try those
mindfulness exercises.

11:43.100 --> 11:46.760
And I can't wait to
see you all next week.

11:46.760 --> 11:47.500
-Let's get a drink.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.150
Come on, let's celebrate.

11:49.150 --> 11:50.340
-I got AA after this.

11:50.340 --> 11:51.040
-You have what?

11:51.040 --> 11:51.940
-AA, girl.

11:51.940 --> 11:52.950
-Oh, oh.

11:52.950 --> 11:54.410
-I'm sober also.

11:54.410 --> 11:55.120
-Want a drink?

11:55.120 --> 11:56.010
-Oh, I'm sober.

11:56.010 --> 11:58.110
I'm sorry.

11:58.110 --> 11:58.830
-There's a lot of us.

11:58.830 --> 11:59.660
-No takers, huh?

11:59.660 --> 12:00.360
-No.

12:00.360 --> 12:03.560
Um-- well, you see,
I just don't want

12:03.560 --> 12:06.940
to go back to the crappy
old Palisades just now.

12:06.940 --> 12:11.240
I'm feeling so
celebratory, and I

12:11.240 --> 12:14.550
was hoping I could find a nearby
place to, um-- I don't know,

12:14.550 --> 12:19.000
have a-- just a-- you
know, festive cocktail.

12:21.540 --> 12:24.880
Can I persuade you to join
me in a festive cocktail?

12:24.880 --> 12:25.580
-OK.

12:25.580 --> 12:27.120
Maybe I can knock off
a little bit early,

12:27.120 --> 12:29.400
but I'll tell you what, why
don't we walk to my place,

12:29.400 --> 12:31.390
because I've got some
crackers I need to get rid of.

12:31.390 --> 12:32.680
-Walk?

12:32.680 --> 12:33.810
That's utterly Parisian.

12:33.810 --> 12:35.380
I'd love to.

12:35.380 --> 12:36.740
You're Davina, right?

12:36.740 --> 12:37.440
-That's right.

12:37.440 --> 12:38.710
-I love your name.

12:38.710 --> 12:39.750
-Well, thank you.

12:39.750 --> 12:41.340
-You are?

12:41.340 --> 12:43.010
-I'm Maura.

12:43.010 --> 12:45.280
-Maura.

12:45.280 --> 12:45.980
-Crackers.

12:45.980 --> 12:46.260
-Mm-hmm.

12:46.260 --> 12:47.150
Let's do it.

12:47.150 --> 12:48.230
-Is this every Wednesday?

12:48.230 --> 12:50.830
-Every Wednesday.

12:50.830 --> 12:52.690
-I don't have any cash at all.

12:52.690 --> 12:54.930
-Why are the car seats down?

12:54.930 --> 12:57.480
-Oh, I-- I uh, moved
them when Tammy

12:57.480 --> 12:59.530
and I went to the tile place.

12:59.530 --> 13:00.490
No, no.

13:00.490 --> 13:01.490
That one goes over there.

13:01.490 --> 13:02.520
-It doesn't matter.

13:02.520 --> 13:03.440
-Yes, it does.

13:03.440 --> 13:06.160
Oh my god, it goes
on the other side.

13:06.160 --> 13:09.460
They like to sit--
here, just switch them.

13:09.460 --> 13:10.650
-Fine, fine, fine.

13:10.650 --> 13:11.350
Here you go.

13:11.350 --> 13:12.060
Take this.

13:12.060 --> 13:12.760
-No.

13:12.760 --> 13:13.690
Excuse me, can I pass.

13:13.690 --> 13:14.390
-Just take the seat.

13:14.390 --> 13:16.350
-Just let me pass, and I'll
put it on the other side.

13:16.350 --> 13:17.480
-Now we're going
to be super-late.

13:17.480 --> 13:18.650
I already looked at the time.

13:18.650 --> 13:19.630
-You know what, Len?

13:19.630 --> 13:22.130
That was the tone thing
that I was talking about.

13:22.130 --> 13:23.020
OK?

13:23.020 --> 13:25.310
Seriously, do you want to
just start a fight now,

13:25.310 --> 13:27.700
or should we wait after we
drop the kids off at my mom's?

13:27.700 --> 13:28.900
Date night turns
you into a monster.

13:28.900 --> 13:29.600
-Really.

13:29.600 --> 13:30.480
Why is this soaked?

13:30.480 --> 13:34.270
Did a Capri-Sun
explode back here?

13:34.270 --> 13:35.130
-Zacky!
Ella!

13:35.130 --> 13:36.210
-You want to talk about tone?

13:36.210 --> 13:38.120
I want you to listen to your
tone when you talk to me.

13:38.120 --> 13:39.990
I'll get a tape recorder, and
I'll play it back for you.

13:39.990 --> 13:40.790
You can fucking hear it.

13:40.790 --> 13:42.040
-Yeah, go get a tape recorder.

13:42.040 --> 13:43.030
-I will.
-Good luck.

13:43.030 --> 13:43.790
-I'll find a store.

13:43.790 --> 13:44.480
-Good luck with that.

14:00.940 --> 14:02.330
-It's not my fault.

14:02.330 --> 14:03.420
-Well, what does that mean?

14:03.420 --> 14:05.010
Did she tell you she
was on birth control?

14:05.010 --> 14:08.320
Was this an accidental
on purpose kinda thing?

14:08.320 --> 14:09.630
Do you have any tofu schmear?

14:09.630 --> 14:10.630
-I think so.

14:10.630 --> 14:11.370
-Thank you.

14:11.370 --> 14:13.100
-Tofu schmear?

14:13.100 --> 14:14.840
What the fuck?

14:14.840 --> 14:17.280
-I'm seeing a trainer, and he
says dairy is basically sludge

14:17.280 --> 14:19.300
in your intestines, and I've
been walking around farting all

14:19.300 --> 14:21.280
the time, so it's
probably the dairy.

14:23.940 --> 14:25.380
Is she going to
have an abortion?

14:25.380 --> 14:26.480
-Of course.

14:26.480 --> 14:27.180
-Here.

14:27.180 --> 14:28.950
Try this, sweetie.

14:28.950 --> 14:29.650
-Thank you.

14:32.300 --> 14:34.420
Have you ever gotten
anybody pregnant before?

14:34.420 --> 14:35.310
-That chick, Carly.

14:35.310 --> 14:36.010
-Oh, this is good.

14:36.010 --> 14:37.480
Can we have a quarter
pound of this, please?

14:37.480 --> 14:39.500
-Mum's going to freak if you
change the standing order.

14:39.500 --> 14:40.390
-I'm not changing it.

14:40.390 --> 14:41.090
I'm adding to it.

14:41.090 --> 14:41.790
It's an addition.

14:46.230 --> 14:49.610
Don't you always think about
this guy in his apartment?

14:49.610 --> 14:51.550
Like, eating dinner
in a folding chair

14:51.550 --> 14:55.330
that he cooked on a hot plate,
just in his boxers and shorts?

14:55.330 --> 14:58.120
-No, I don't think
about that ever.

14:58.120 --> 14:59.500
Why would you think about that?

14:59.500 --> 15:00.200
-I can't help it.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.930
-Can I pay up now, please?

15:01.930 --> 15:02.630
-OK, you know what?

15:02.630 --> 15:03.330
Fine.

15:03.330 --> 15:06.480
I'll just swing back around
and pick up his soccer stuff

15:06.480 --> 15:08.100
and drop it off later.

15:08.100 --> 15:10.020
-God, you can hear
them from here?

15:10.020 --> 15:11.250
That's depressing.

15:11.250 --> 15:12.150
-Happy Sunday.

15:12.150 --> 15:12.590
-Yeah.

15:12.590 --> 15:13.800
-Let's get the kids
out, save the future.

15:13.800 --> 15:15.250
-And you wouldn't
have to do that if you

15:15.250 --> 15:16.200
had thought to pack it.

15:16.200 --> 15:17.550
-Well, if you'd seen
it in the foyer,

15:17.550 --> 15:18.650
I don't understand
why you didn't

15:18.650 --> 15:19.720
just put it into the car.

15:19.720 --> 15:21.720
-Because I don't do things if
I'm not being asked to do them

15:21.720 --> 15:23.780
because I don't like
getting in trouble.

15:23.780 --> 15:24.480
-Anybody else?

15:24.480 --> 15:25.880
-Because you're like a child.

15:25.880 --> 15:27.820
-Can we take the kids out
so you guys can continue

15:27.820 --> 15:28.920
whatever it is
that you're doing?

15:28.920 --> 15:29.780
-Can you that that?

15:29.780 --> 15:30.650
Do you mind?

15:30.650 --> 15:31.360
-I want to take it.

15:31.360 --> 15:32.060
-You take it then.

15:32.060 --> 15:34.470
You take it.

15:34.470 --> 15:35.270
You take it.

15:38.160 --> 15:41.160
Oh, man.

15:41.160 --> 15:43.430
Are you being serious?

15:43.430 --> 15:45.280
The forecast calls for tears?

15:45.280 --> 15:46.510
Are you not having
any fun today?

15:46.510 --> 15:47.910
You're not going to
have one ounce of fun.

15:47.910 --> 15:51.260
-Ella forgot her dream light.

15:51.260 --> 15:54.920
-I got a dream light for you.

15:54.920 --> 15:57.270
One dream light.

15:57.270 --> 15:59.270
Free.

15:59.270 --> 16:02.270
You gonna be like this all day?

16:02.270 --> 16:08.320
-So the other-- the other day
when Tammy and I were late,

16:08.320 --> 16:10.680
we were at my dad's place.

16:10.680 --> 16:12.910
You know, we were, like,
looking at the house.

16:12.910 --> 16:17.720
And he walked in, and he was--

16:21.070 --> 16:24.760
He was dressed as a woman.

16:24.760 --> 16:26.220
-Wait, what?

16:26.220 --> 16:26.920
-Coming.

16:26.920 --> 16:28.640
I'm coming.

16:28.640 --> 16:29.600
Hello!

16:29.600 --> 16:32.260
Oh, Zacky, my--

16:32.960 --> 16:35.360
-Sarah and Len will
be in in a minute.

16:35.360 --> 16:38.870
-Oh my god, my baby,
gorgeous as ever.

16:38.870 --> 16:39.760
Thank you.

16:39.760 --> 16:40.250
Hello.

16:40.250 --> 16:40.950
Go.

16:40.950 --> 16:42.200
Go, go, go, go, go.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.470
What-- who changed
the standing order?

16:47.470 --> 16:49.900
-Ali got tofu schmear.

16:49.900 --> 16:51.870
-Why'd Ali get tofu schmear?

16:51.870 --> 16:52.810
What about the lox spread?

16:52.810 --> 16:53.740
What about the veggie?

16:53.740 --> 16:54.890
-Nothing was replaced.

16:54.890 --> 16:56.190
It was in addition to.

16:56.190 --> 16:57.320
I'm dairy free.

16:57.320 --> 16:58.020
-That's good.

16:58.020 --> 16:59.420
I'm dairy free too.

16:59.420 --> 17:00.620
-Since when?

17:00.620 --> 17:01.750
-Right now.

17:01.750 --> 17:02.820
I've been meaning to cut it out.

17:02.820 --> 17:04.180
It makes me very gassy.

17:04.180 --> 17:05.880
-Yeah, that's probably
where you get it from.

17:08.590 --> 17:09.810
-How's Ed?

17:09.810 --> 17:12.180
-All he does is stare.

17:12.180 --> 17:13.540
-What does the doctor say?

17:13.540 --> 17:14.240
-The doctor?

17:14.240 --> 17:15.230
The doctor?

17:15.230 --> 17:16.660
What does the doctor say?

17:16.660 --> 17:17.570
What does the doctor say?

17:17.570 --> 17:19.250
I should write a song.

17:19.250 --> 17:20.750
What does the doctor say?

17:20.750 --> 17:23.810
It could be like this
for the rest of my life.

17:23.810 --> 17:28.150
I could die and be rotting in
my casket before anyone notices.

17:28.150 --> 17:30.620
-Well, you should get help.

17:30.620 --> 17:32.190
-Why can't you help?

17:32.190 --> 17:32.890
Hm?

17:32.890 --> 17:35.170
Did you get a job yet?

17:35.170 --> 17:38.070
Hm?

17:38.070 --> 17:39.030
That's what I thought.

17:39.030 --> 17:40.540
KIDS: (SINGING) What
does the doctor say?

17:40.540 --> 17:42.500
What does the doctor say?

17:42.500 --> 17:43.970
What does the doctor say?

17:43.970 --> 17:46.360
ALL: What does the doctor say?

17:46.360 --> 17:49.400
What does the doctor say?

17:49.400 --> 17:51.570
-I grew up in Los Angeles.

17:51.570 --> 17:54.450
I did the-- I don't know,
the whole Jewish thing.

17:54.450 --> 17:55.960
It's like musical chairs.

17:55.960 --> 17:59.520
You hit 25, and you
just choose the one

17:59.520 --> 18:01.610
who's standing closest to you.

18:01.610 --> 18:04.580
So we had three kids, and
we lived in two houses.

18:04.580 --> 18:07.870
We had so many pets.

18:07.870 --> 18:10.040
And then finita la commedia.

18:10.040 --> 18:10.900
-Tell me about your kids.

18:10.900 --> 18:11.600
-Mm-hmm.

18:11.600 --> 18:12.870
Yeah.

18:12.870 --> 18:16.410
Sarah, she's my oldest, I
told her, and she took it.

18:16.410 --> 18:19.500
She actually took it--
oh, this is beautiful.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.540
She took it very well.

18:21.540 --> 18:22.420
Maybe too well.

18:22.420 --> 18:24.550
You know, I think she's
internalising the whole thing.

18:24.550 --> 18:27.210
And next thing you know,
she's gonna have shingles.

18:27.210 --> 18:29.040
There's Joshy.

18:29.040 --> 18:30.990
He's my very successful son.

18:30.990 --> 18:33.220
He's in the music business.

18:33.220 --> 18:37.130
He's very, very, very, very,
very, very image conscious.

18:37.130 --> 18:40.010
You know, he always-- the now
thing and the now restaurant

18:40.010 --> 18:44.800
and the now, you know, jacket
and the now sunglasses, the now

18:44.800 --> 18:49.510
girlfriend, the now dungarees.

18:49.510 --> 18:50.560
And then there's Ali.

18:50.560 --> 18:53.670
She's my baby.

18:53.670 --> 18:55.670
That girl does
not seem to learn.
