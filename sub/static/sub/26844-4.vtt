00:10.172 --> 00:12.000

really help is letting
me get back to work.

KURT: Go.

00:12.862 --> 00:14.137
MARTA: They're

00:14.172 --> 00:15.310
Whose side are you on?

00:15.344 --> 00:17.000
HANA: The side of
following orders.

ROLAND: IMSF is dangerously
close to becoming irrelevant.

ROBERT: I'm here for you.
HANA: I know.

00:21.310 --> 00:24.034
MIKE: A rover was
taken into the field
without authorization.

00:24.068 --> 00:25.758
She doesn't
respect your authority.

00:25.793 --> 00:26.724
HANA: Solar flare.

00:26.758 --> 00:28.172
It's taken out our
entire communications.

00:28.206 --> 00:31.275
Without navigation, she could
freeze to death before we find
her.

But identical to the
strain you already discovered.

-Block those two off,
go to the main one now.

Turn that one off, switch
the main reciever over there,

01:27.344 --> 01:31.206
-Hey, hey Terry, we need to keep
the slurry clear of the rig.
-Roger that.

to watch that coolant flow.

02:17.379 --> 02:19.896
Just give me a minute.

02:20.758 --> 02:22.344

you need more than a minute.

02:22.379 --> 02:24.965
Why don't you just go
ahead and sit down?

02:29.206 --> 02:30.551
JEN: You know,
you can shut up.

02:30.586 --> 02:34.068
I do more work out

you do in a whole day.

02:52.551 --> 02:55.206

02:55.793 --> 02:58.482
MARTA: Fan-fantastic.

03:01.344 --> 03:04.137
Do I, do I still have my toes?

03:04.172 --> 03:05.413
HANA: Yeah.

03:05.448 --> 03:07.034
But you did have frostbite.

03:07.068 --> 03:09.103
You were severely hypothermic.

03:09.137 --> 03:11.034
MARTA: Hmph.

03:11.068 --> 03:13.482
HANA: What the hell
were you thinking?

03:15.137 --> 03:18.206
MARTA: I don't
regret doing what I did.

03:18.241 --> 03:20.034
I think that's
what you're asking.

03:20.068 --> 03:22.172
I, I needed to
get those samples.

03:22.206 --> 03:25.206
HANA: You ignored my direct
command, which was stupid and
dangerous.

03:25.241 --> 03:27.241
MARTA: Those idiots were
contaminating the site.

03:27.275 --> 03:29.241
HANA: 20 more minutes and
you would have been dead.

03:29.275 --> 03:32.068
I can't put one more
person in the ground.

03:32.310 --> 03:33.586
I can't.

may I speak with you?

03:47.275 --> 03:48.965

You all right?

03:50.620 --> 03:53.172
HANA: I don't know.

03:54.310 --> 03:57.448
Sometimes I'm fine.

03:57.482 --> 04:00.310
Then it'll just come out
of nowhere, this thing.

04:01.344 --> 04:03.551
I can't control.

04:03.586 --> 04:05.137
I'm not sure why.

04:05.172 --> 04:09.172
When it happens, it makes
me feel like I don't know
what I'm doing here.

04:09.206 --> 04:11.620
ROBERT: Shh.

04:11.931 --> 04:17.413
I know what you're doing, and
there's no one that can do it
any better.

04:17.793 --> 04:20.482
But you can't deny
you're grieving.

04:20.517 --> 04:23.655
You're still mourning Joon.

04:24.551 --> 04:27.655
Here, come here.

04:32.103 --> 04:35.000
HANA: I'm okay.

04:36.413 --> 04:39.137
It'll be fine.

04:40.241 --> 04:43.068
It's going to be fine.

04:57.172 --> 04:59.448
JAVIER: Gabriella.

04:59.482 --> 05:01.724
AMELIE: Hey, oh my God.

05:01.758 --> 05:04.448
Did you just say another
woman's name in your sleep?

05:05.448 --> 05:07.482
JAVIER: I wasn't asleep.

05:07.517 --> 05:09.793
AMELIE: Who is Gabriella?

05:09.827 --> 05:12.275
JAVIER: It's my
grandmother's name.

05:12.310 --> 05:14.034
AMELIE: Your
grandmother's name?

05:14.068 --> 05:15.344
JAVIER: Yeah.

05:15.379 --> 05:17.620
How would you feel
about that for her?

05:18.275 --> 05:19.655
AMELIE: Uh.

05:19.689 --> 05:22.551
Javier, I'm only at
four months, you know.

05:23.034 --> 05:26.448
JAVIER: It's your nature as a
doctor to be cautious, but the
baby's going to be fine.

05:28.758 --> 05:31.172
All signs are positive so far.

05:31.206 --> 05:34.206
AMELIE: Yeah, but we've got
plenty of time to choose a
name.

05:35.620 --> 05:38.310
And I really
have to go to work.

05:40.344 --> 05:41.827
JAVIER: Be late today.
AMELIE: No, I can't.

05:41.862 --> 05:43.724
JAVIER: You can.
AMELIE: No.

05:43.758 --> 05:46.517
Come on, we've got
plenty of time for that, too.

05:46.862 --> 05:48.793
JAVIER: Yeah.
AMELIE: Yeah.

AMELIE: I can't, I have to go.

05:52.862 --> 05:55.137
I have to.

06:02.344 --> 06:04.793
JAVIER: You're going to

06:04.827 --> 06:07.172
AMELIE: Yup. I know.

06:17.724 --> 06:19.103
SHEP: She's not good.

06:19.137 --> 06:20.448
DOCTOR: How long has
she been like this?

06:20.482 --> 06:22.517
SHEP: She started
coughing like this just
a couple of hours ago.

06:22.551 --> 06:24.172
JEN: It's getting
hard to breathe.

06:24.206 --> 06:27.689

getting a cold or something
but no way is this a cold.

06:28.517 --> 06:31.413

What about the rest of you?

06:40.172 --> 06:41.517

06:41.551 --> 06:44.379
SHEP: Yeah, well, I guess
we're not feeling so hot,
either.

06:44.413 --> 06:46.689
DOCTOR: Okay, we need to close
the doors, we need to close
them now.

06:46.724 --> 06:48.655
KURT: Whoa, whoa, whoa, what
the hell's going on in there?

06:48.689 --> 06:50.655
DOCTOR: Something at the site
has been making them sick.

06:50.689 --> 06:53.103
Anyone that's been down
there needs to be quarantined.

06:53.310 --> 06:55.448
Stop the drilling.

HANA: How did you do with
the solar flare yesterday?

06:59.344 --> 07:02.172
CHEN: We were on the dark side
of the planet when it hit, so
no problems here.

07:02.206 --> 07:03.931
HANA: Yeah, we
weren't so lucky.

07:03.965 --> 07:06.482
Easy to see why you're not in
a hurry to settle on the
surface.

07:06.689 --> 07:08.517
CHEN: But
everything's okay now?

07:08.551 --> 07:10.517

call coming in from Lukrum.

HANA: Sorry,
commander, I have to go.

07:13.793 --> 07:15.482
KURT: Commander,
we've got a problem.

07:15.517 --> 07:17.827
Our camp's been hit by
some kind of contagion.

07:17.862 --> 07:19.758
Made a bunch of my guys sick.

07:19.793 --> 07:21.689
Looks like it
originated at our drill site.

07:21.724 --> 07:22.965
HANA: What are the symptoms?

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
KURT: Coughing, fever,
difficulty breathing.

07:25.034 --> 07:27.862
Jen's got it the worst, but
I've got six other guys going
downhill fast,

07:27.896 --> 07:29.448
including our doc.

07:29.482 --> 07:31.551
I'm hoping you can send
me one of yours to help.

07:31.586 --> 07:33.724
JAVIER: Not Amelie, no way.

07:33.758 --> 07:35.517
HANA: We'll send Dr. Johar,
but it'll take a while.

07:35.551 --> 07:36.896
ROBERT: I can get
him there quicker.

07:36.931 --> 07:38.827
I've got a few tricks up
my sleeve with the rover.

07:38.862 --> 07:40.448
HANA: Be careful.

07:40.482 --> 07:42.689
ROBERT: I will.

07:44.586 --> 07:46.206
KURT: I appreciate
the help, commander.

07:46.241 --> 07:47.482
HANA: Of course.

07:47.517 --> 07:48.758
VOICE [over computer]:

07:50.448 --> 07:51.827
I know they're close.

07:51.862 --> 07:53.275
JAVIER: The lab

07:53.310 --> 07:55.517
I'll go find him.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.413
HANA: Wait. He said drill site.

07:59.448 --> 08:01.724
Cameras, Med Bay.

08:01.758 --> 08:04.517
Amelie, stop,
don't go in there.

08:09.965 --> 08:11.275
AMELIE: What's wrong?

08:11.310 --> 08:13.413
HANA: There's a contagion
going through the Lukrum
Colony.

08:13.448 --> 08:15.413
Everyone from the drill
site is coughing, feverish,

08:15.448 --> 08:17.482
and experiencing
respiratory distress.

08:17.517 --> 08:19.724
Marta was there, too.

08:20.034 --> 08:22.379
AMELIE: No, but she's fine.

08:22.413 --> 08:25.517
I mean, good vitals, no
fever, no symptoms whatsoever.

08:26.413 --> 08:29.724
Marta, have, have you
been coughing at all?

08:30.034 --> 08:31.793
MARTA: No, why?

08:31.827 --> 08:35.862
HANA: Lukrum's dealing with a
drill-site-related illness
that's sweeping their camp.

08:36.241 --> 08:39.931
MARTA: Maybe they drilled
deeper today, and released
some sort of pathogen.

08:43.344 --> 08:46.655
Or maybe they went
too far, too fast.

08:50.034 --> 08:54.758
-If we manage to go to Mars,
you don't want any surprises,
you don't want anything that

08:54.793 --> 08:58.827
could end up killing you, that

08:59.793 --> 09:04.000
The great explorers of the
15th and 16th centuries

09:04.034 --> 09:06.827
they had never seen before.

09:06.862 --> 09:08.586
Diseases don't
carry passports.

09:08.620 --> 09:10.793
They will be
wherever humans go.

SONIA: If you think about our
entire history, every time
we've expanded our territory,

09:15.586 --> 09:20.482
we've disrupted the environment,
creating new conditions where
diseases can spread.

09:21.137 --> 09:25.379
This problem is intimately
tied to our industrial
activities.

09:28.137 --> 09:31.862
It's usually the extractive
industries who are first to
try to penetrate areas that

09:31.896 --> 09:33.965
are newly available.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.103
They're bringing new people
into these remote areas,
they're building roads and

09:37.137 --> 09:41.034
drilling in new places,
and creating these new
opportunities for microbes

09:41.068 --> 09:43.482
to emerge and to spread.

09:43.931 --> 09:47.068
REPORTER [over TV]: Russia is

REPORTER [over TV]: The
place where the outbreak
is occurring is called

the end of the Earth,
or the Yamal Peninsula.

10:32.931 --> 10:35.965
REPORTER [over TV]: An
outbreak of anthrax in Siberia
has been blamed on a heat wave

10:36.000 --> 10:39.586
melting infected reindeer
carcasses, that were
frozen in the tundra.

11:29.068 --> 11:32.551
JOEL: I think it's very
difficult and very dangerous
to be a protester in Russia

11:32.586 --> 11:34.965
now, especially in the Arctic.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.068
When the government is
so incredibly supportive
of the industry,

11:39.103 --> 11:41.793
when the government
actually owns the industry,

11:41.827 --> 11:43.724
you're essentially
protesting the government.

11:43.758 --> 11:46.137
And we all know how
that goes in Russia.

11:46.172 --> 11:47.931
It's not a easy thing.

12:40.965 --> 12:43.758
SONIA: This isn't some
faraway problem, this is

tropical diseases take root.

12:52.862 --> 12:56.793
-CDC considers climate change
a serious public concern.

12:57.103 --> 13:00.241
-Climate change may also
heighten the risk of
infectious diseases.

13:00.827 --> 13:04.137
SONIA: Climate change will
allow diseases to take hold in
new ways that they haven't

13:04.172 --> 13:06.862
been able to in the past.

13:06.896 --> 13:09.000
-We're changing our
environment very, very quickly

13:09.034 --> 13:11.241
in ways that we just
can't anticipate, and

13:11.275 --> 13:14.379
re-activating very dangerous
infectious microbes.

13:14.413 --> 13:18.206
So if we go and we colonize
Mars, we could be exposed to
new infections,

13:18.827 --> 13:21.758
and that's a really
dangerous spot to be in.

14:43.068 --> 14:45.413
JAVIER: What? Why?

14:45.448 --> 14:48.931
AMELIE: Because what he has is
very contagious, and we can't

SONIA: With emerging diseases,
every day is a huge opportunity
to prevent a crisis.

15:28.448 --> 15:32.379
If you delay, then there's so
many people out there who are
infected,

PARDIS: When outbreaks happen,
you need that definitive
early response,

17:00.275 --> 17:03.482
otherwise before you know it,
they escalate and can get out
of control.

17:04.931 --> 17:09.551
ELON: When there's a lot of
people in close proximity if one
person has an illness and it's

17:09.586 --> 17:13.310

everyone can get that illness
before it's quarantined.

She was with the rescue
crew that brought Marta back.

17:27.758 --> 17:31.517

passed through direct contact,
or is it airborne?

And why didn't Marta
get sick if she was at
the drill site too?

MIKE: I don't know.
It doesn't make sense.

17:37.068 --> 17:38.551
HANA: No, it doesn't.

17:38.586 --> 17:41.172
But until we figure it out,
cut off all air circulation

17:41.206 --> 17:43.655
and confine everyone
to their habs.

lead on all this, if you're
not in the right head space.

not feeling...

JAVIER: What else?
We have to help him.

to administer them, okay?

JAVIER: Okay.

AMELIE: I'll walk you

An unknown, highly contagious
pathogen is sweeping through
the Lukrum Colony,

19:09.344 --> 19:13.206
and now appears to have
infected at least one crew
member at Olympus Town.

19:13.241 --> 19:17.344
We're not sure exactly what
we're dealing with, but we do
know that the illness that's

19:17.379 --> 19:20.103
being caused is quite severe.

19:20.137 --> 19:22.586
We'll keep you apprised of
the situation as it develops.

AMELIE: It's going to be okay.

We've got other
antibiotics to try.

who are pretty gravely ill,
but no one's dead yet.

HANA: Well that's
some good news.

first to be diagnosed.

22:32.551 --> 22:34.034
How is it she's still alive?

22:34.068 --> 22:35.655
JOHAR: I don't know.

But I just checked on her,
she's deteriorating but she's
hanging in there.

22:37.827 --> 22:39.620
HANA: Why?
What are you thinking?

22:39.655 --> 22:42.448

probably not patient zero.

MARTA: Cameron?
Cameron is...?

22:52.896 --> 22:55.862

been exposed to the pathogen
first, in your lab.

22:57.310 --> 22:59.448
MARTA: That's impossible.

22:59.482 --> 23:00.862

23:00.896 --> 23:04.000
And no one in the colony
did either, until Javier
went into your lab.

23:04.620 --> 23:07.000
Now he's infected and
we're running out of time.

The only thing new that was
introduced were your samples
from the drill site.

He told me, he told me he
found the same microbial forms
we've been working with.

23:18.620 --> 23:21.068
Maybe he missed something.

23:21.103 --> 23:23.931
Maybe.

30:56.551 --> 30:59.344
Penicillin is barely
used in the West anymore.

31:04.344 --> 31:07.068
HANA: What about the East?

31:07.827 --> 31:11.931
Not only is penicillin widely
prescribed in China, most of
the world's supply is actually

31:11.965 --> 31:13.586
manufactured there.

31:13.620 --> 31:17.206
We'll need a capsule dropped
immediately, otherwise our
death toll will rise.

31:17.827 --> 31:21.344
So with your permission, I'd
like to call on our friends at
the space station for their

31:21.379 --> 31:23.103
help in this emergency.

31:23.137 --> 31:24.551
VOICE [over computer]:
Transmission ended.

31:24.586 --> 31:26.034
ROLAND: You can't allow
her to make that request.

31:26.068 --> 31:30.000
The Chinese broadcast
24/7 from their space
station to the public.

31:30.034 --> 31:32.482
If she communicates
with them in any way
about this contagion,

31:32.517 --> 31:34.310
the entire world will know.

31:34.344 --> 31:36.137
LESLIE: That can't possibly
be your first concern.

31:36.172 --> 31:38.068
ROLAND: Look, an
accident is one thing.

31:38.103 --> 31:40.379
But a plague is another.

31:40.413 --> 31:44.896
If this gets out, stocks will
plummet, and the colonization
of Mars will be over,

31:45.172 --> 31:46.689
before it begins.

31:46.724 --> 31:49.241
LESLIE: And if it gets out
that we didn't ask for help,
and dozens die?

31:49.275 --> 31:51.068
ROLAND: The point is,
it wouldn't get out.

31:51.103 --> 31:54.551
Neither of our organizations
broadcasts publicly, at least
not without complete control

31:54.586 --> 31:56.655
of the feed.

31:56.689 --> 31:59.241
Any of the families affected
by this, they've all

31:59.275 --> 32:01.310
pre-signed non-disclosure
agreements.

32:01.344 --> 32:03.620
Obviously they'll
be well-compensated.

32:03.655 --> 32:06.379
LESLIE: You might be willing
to stand by and watch people
die.

32:07.620 --> 32:08.965
I'm not.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.758
ROLAND: Secretary General.

32:10.793 --> 32:13.275
I would suggest you not bring
your personal history with
Martian tragedies into this

32:13.310 --> 32:16.655
decision-making process.

32:18.068 --> 32:22.103
LESLIE: I intend to explore a
diplomatic back-channel
solution with the Chinese,

32:22.137 --> 32:23.965
here on Earth.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.551
I'm going to ask them to
disrupt their live streaming.

32:25.586 --> 32:27.206
ROLAND: But they won't.

32:27.241 --> 32:30.206
It pays for half
of their operation.

32:30.241 --> 32:33.344
Which will force me into a
fairly defensive position.

32:33.586 --> 32:36.758
If after all your best
diplomatic efforts, word of
this illness does get out,

32:36.793 --> 32:41.482
I'll make absolutely sure that
everyone understands exactly
where it originated.

32:41.965 --> 32:45.620
And as we're both aware, it's
not with Lukrum Industries.

32:47.206 --> 32:50.034
VOICE [over computer]:

32:51.586 --> 32:54.172
SONIA: Disease is intimately
linked with commerce.

32:54.206 --> 32:58.517
There's a huge economic cost
when these outbreaks spread
like wildfire.

32:59.068 --> 33:02.241
REPORTER [over TV]: The virus
and fears about it could
disrupt local economies.

33:02.275 --> 33:05.758
The cost to the global economy
of SARS was $40 billion.

33:05.793 --> 33:09.344
Consumer behavior changed
dramatically due to fear.

33:09.379 --> 33:12.206
SONIA: A lot of governments
feel like it's in their
economic interest to keep

33:12.241 --> 33:14.379
these things quiet.

33:14.413 --> 33:18.172
-You don't want to admit
that you've got a problem,
and so naturally,

33:18.206 --> 33:20.206
that's what
everyone tries to do.

33:20.241 --> 33:23.000
They stuff down outbreaks
until it's impossible to
ignore.

33:42.586 --> 33:45.620
REPORTER [over TV]: Many of
the nomadic people who herd
reindeer have been infected

33:45.655 --> 33:47.724
with deadly bacterial disease.

33:47.758 --> 33:51.413
At least 72 people are under
observation in the hospital.

33:52.827 --> 33:58.620
JOEL: These Arctic people called
the Nenets are affected most
by suddenly coming across and

33:58.655 --> 34:01.517
being exposed to
this old anthrax virus.

34:01.551 --> 34:03.620
And this is their backyard.

35:28.586 --> 35:32.172
JOEL: When the anthrax
outbreak occurred, the
government wants to suppress

35:32.206 --> 35:34.586
any bad news that
comes from that area.

35:38.310 --> 35:40.586
ANTONIA: The expectations of the
amount of oil and natural gas

35:40.620 --> 35:43.655
in the Arctic regions
are astronomical.

35:44.172 --> 35:47.344
Putin wants Russia to have
control of that territory,
both for the power that that

35:47.379 --> 35:51.172
territory gives him and for
the oil and natural resources
that are in it.

36:24.000 --> 36:27.482
JOEL: Russia is using the oil
and gas industry to lay down
the infrastructure for a

36:27.517 --> 36:30.310
future Arctic civilization.

36:30.344 --> 36:33.482
In the grand scheme of Russian
Arctic development, a few
people dying of anthrax is

36:33.517 --> 36:36.448
probably small
potatoes to them.

36:36.482 --> 36:41.620
STEPHEN: Disease could sweep
through a Mars colony, and I can
imagine a scenario where people

36:41.655 --> 36:45.862
would lie, cheat, and steal in
order to make sure that their
mission was successful,

36:45.896 --> 36:48.827
even if that costs a
lot of human lives.

36:49.655 --> 36:52.551
LESLIE: You're not to contact
the space station until I've
reached an agreement with the

36:52.586 --> 36:54.034
Chinese government.

36:54.068 --> 36:56.655
I'm due to speak with their
representatives momentarily.

36:56.689 --> 37:00.344
I don't anticipate problems
given their cooperation in our
terraforming efforts.

37:00.379 --> 37:02.793
I'll have an
answer for you soon.

37:02.827 --> 37:05.551
Hopefully within a few hours.

AMELIE: No, Javier
doesn't have hours.

37:09.310 --> 37:10.896
You have to do something,
and you have to do it now.

37:10.931 --> 37:13.896
MIKE: I understand you're
upset, but the entire mission
is at stake here.

37:14.689 --> 37:15.724
One man...

37:15.758 --> 37:17.827
AMELIE: One man? One man!

37:17.862 --> 37:21.862
Do you not know or do
you not care that he
will die without it?

37:21.896 --> 37:23.758
HANA: Stop!

37:27.379 --> 37:29.862
Comms, connect me
to Commander Chen.

37:35.896 --> 37:38.413
SONIA: Infection is natural.

37:38.448 --> 37:40.413
Infections are going to happen.

37:40.448 --> 37:42.413
But epidemics are political.

37:42.448 --> 37:44.896
They are not a purely
scientific problem.

37:46.551 --> 37:49.034
It's a real conflict of
interest governments have.

37:49.068 --> 37:50.896
On one hand, they want
to protect public health.

37:50.931 --> 37:54.827
On the other hand, you know,
they don't want to suffer this
huge blow to their economies.

37:56.137 --> 37:58.655
Look at what happened
with SARS, for example.

37:59.724 --> 38:02.793
REPORTER [over TV]: The
Chinese Communist authorities
are now paying a price for

38:02.827 --> 38:05.758
their failure to acknowledge
the SARS virus, the disease

38:05.793 --> 38:08.413
remains shrouded in in secrecy.

38:08.448 --> 38:11.586
SONIA: SARS broke out,
the Chinese government was
very secretive about it.

38:11.620 --> 38:14.724
In the beginning, they
didn't want to let WHO
officials come see it.

38:15.344 --> 38:18.344
MAN: We are putting
in measures to
prevent the spread.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.344
SONIA: Because it was too
disruptive to trade, so they
kept it a secret.

38:22.689 --> 38:25.586
And then it went out on
airplanes, and infected so
many other countries.

38:26.206 --> 38:29.793
WOMAN: It remains the
threat that a traveler
could be the next case.

38:30.551 --> 38:33.793
SONIA: This kind of conflict
of interest ultimately is
going to spell the difference

38:33.827 --> 38:38.379
between whether a few people
get sick from a new pathogen,
or a lot of people get sick.

39:10.931 --> 39:14.206
REPORTER [over TV]: Your
health could be at risk
because of climate change.

39:14.241 --> 39:16.517
REPORTER [over TV]: The flu
outbreak that has been
spreading so fast.

39:16.551 --> 39:18.137
REPORTER [over TV]: The
temperatures are rising and

39:18.172 --> 39:20.448
so are worries about
the Zika virus.

39:26.034 --> 39:27.931
-Everything that
we've looked at with this
virus seems to be a bit

39:27.965 --> 39:30.034
scarier than we
initially thought.

39:30.068 --> 39:32.448
REPORTER [over TV]:
There is no vaccine and
no medicine to treat it.

39:35.241 --> 39:37.862
-Outbreaks are borderless.

39:37.896 --> 39:42.034
When governments are hiding an
outbreak from you in any way,
that's where you're in danger,

39:42.068 --> 39:44.551
that's when the, the
virus is actually winning.

39:45.862 --> 39:49.000
And so I understand why
people go rogue and work
out of the system,

39:50.206 --> 39:54.482
because ultimately there are
so many times in which, if you
just waited for everybody else

39:54.517 --> 39:57.620
to act, you would just
be sitting there
watching people die.

40:01.275 --> 40:07.241
[beeping].

40:46.068 --> 40:52.551
[coughing].

41:01.620 --> 41:04.275
AMELIE: Hurry,
every second counts.

41:10.103 --> 41:12.137
Is he breathing?

41:12.172 --> 41:13.586
MARTA: Yes.

41:13.620 --> 41:15.793
AMELIE: Is he taking it in?

41:15.827 --> 41:17.068
MARTA: I can't tell.

41:17.103 --> 41:19.241
AMELIE: Marta, you have
to squeeze the inhaler!

41:19.275 --> 41:21.758
MARTA: I am.

41:33.862 --> 41:36.344
I think he's getting it.

41:36.379 --> 41:38.965
He's getting it.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.689
HANA: We've done
everything we can.

41:40.724 --> 41:42.137
AMELIE: Yeah.

41:42.172 --> 41:44.862
HANA: So we have
to be patient now.

41:44.896 --> 41:46.758
LESLIE: With a twenty minute
delay between transmissions,

41:46.793 --> 41:48.379
she obviously felt
it couldn't wait.

41:48.413 --> 41:50.689
ROLAND: You have no
control over your people.

41:50.724 --> 41:52.862
LESLIE: She did
the right thing.

41:52.896 --> 41:54.379
ROLAND: She defied your order.

41:54.413 --> 41:56.413
LESLIE: No images were released.

41:56.448 --> 41:58.965
There was a request for
medical aid, the suggestion of
an illness.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.379
That's all.

42:00.413 --> 42:03.068
Words don't make an
impression like pictures do.

42:03.103 --> 42:06.034
And thanks to Hana,
we have one death to
explain, not dozens,

42:06.068 --> 42:08.034
as would have been the
case in Lukrum Colony.

42:08.068 --> 42:10.103
ROLAND: I hope you're right.

42:12.965 --> 42:16.310
LESLIE: Yes,
Mars has pathogens.

42:17.413 --> 42:19.379
But so does Earth,

42:19.413 --> 42:22.275
where explorers have
faced malaria, cholera,

42:22.310 --> 42:25.793
and many other diseases.

42:25.827 --> 42:29.000
But they didn't stop.
They fought back.

42:29.034 --> 42:34.000
And some died.
But mostly, they endured.

42:36.724 --> 42:39.310
And if they hadn't, we
wouldn't be here now.

42:40.655 --> 42:44.344
And that's exactly what our
brave pioneers on Mars are
doing.

42:45.862 --> 42:47.758
Facing the unknown,

42:48.931 --> 42:51.793
overcoming
its dangers and,

42:51.827 --> 42:55.206
yes, sometimes
making mistakes.

42:57.000 --> 43:01.689
But the truth is, they
are role models for us all.

43:09.448 --> 43:13.344
MARTA: I uh, I didn't
mean for this to happen.

43:17.862 --> 43:20.172
I came here to find life.

43:20.482 --> 43:23.000
To study life.

43:23.827 --> 43:27.344
But, but not at
the expense of it.

43:30.034 --> 43:32.448
I'm sorry.

43:36.965 --> 43:38.931
KURT: Thanks.
For all you've done.

43:38.965 --> 43:40.896
JOHAR: Happy to help.

43:41.689 --> 43:46.000
KURT: And you have some
serious building skills.
I don't know how to thank you.

43:46.551 --> 43:48.206
ROBERT: You don't have to.

43:48.241 --> 43:50.413
KURT: Alright, how about I
make you an offer, then?

43:50.448 --> 43:52.827
Why don't you come
here and work with us?

43:54.310 --> 43:57.862
Put your skills to real use.
Lukrum's got big plans.

43:57.896 --> 44:00.344
We could use someone like you.

44:03.551 --> 44:07.310
ROBERT: I appreciate the
offer, but I'm needed
back at my colony.

44:10.965 --> 44:14.275
KURT: Alright, thanks.
ROBERT: You got it, buddy.

44:16.206 --> 44:18.344
JAVIER: You don't
have to stay all night.

44:18.379 --> 44:21.034
I'm feeling better.

44:21.482 --> 44:25.862
You have two to take care
of, and you must be
pretty tired yourself.

44:26.241 --> 44:29.034
AMELIE: I'm not
going anywhere.

44:29.310 --> 44:32.103
Besides, I have
something to tell you.

44:32.137 --> 44:34.827
JAVIER: What?

44:38.551 --> 44:42.344
AMELIE: I love
the name Gabriella.

44:45.068 --> 44:47.586
ROBERT: To defying
direct orders.

44:47.862 --> 44:50.551
HANA: Not funny.

44:55.586 --> 44:59.137
ROBERT: But you did it for all
the right reasons, which took
a hell of a lot of guts.

45:00.586 --> 45:03.379
HANA: I'm sure I'll pay
a price for it somehow.

45:07.068 --> 45:10.000
Thanks for pulling
hazard duty at Lukrum.

45:10.344 --> 45:13.344
ROBERT: In a weird
way, it was my pleasure.

45:17.103 --> 45:19.862
HANA: It wasn't easy
letting you go, you know.

45:20.275 --> 45:23.000
Especially when we
thought it was ground zero.

45:23.413 --> 45:25.379
ROBERT: Were you
scared for me?

45:25.413 --> 45:27.517
HANA: I was.

45:32.103 --> 45:35.413
I really was.

45:41.275 --> 45:44.551
Robert, we can't.

45:52.482 --> 45:56.482
MIKE: Secretary General,
normally I wouldn't
reach out like this,

45:56.517 --> 45:59.448
but the situation
here demands it.

45:59.482 --> 46:03.517
It's my observation, as second
in command, that Commander
Seung is suffering from

46:03.551 --> 46:06.620
depression relating to
the death of her sister.

46:08.206 --> 46:11.620
She's distracted,
in a weakened capacity,

46:11.655 --> 46:15.000
and as a result, has
made grave errors.

46:16.137 --> 46:19.586
It's my opinion that this
colony requires new
leadership.
