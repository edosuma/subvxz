I was trying to get you to
like my squad mate Warwick.

20:01.890 --> 20:02.388
What?

20:02.390 --> 20:04.223
He has a big crush on you.

20:04.225 --> 20:06.059
And he wanted me to tell you

20:06.061 --> 20:08.327
that he can do ten push-ups.

20:08.329 --> 20:09.295
But I couldn't do that.

20:09.297 --> 20:11.831
It's just too big of a lie.

20:12.267 --> 20:16.969
So, you were just hanging
out with me for Warwick?

20:16.971 --> 20:17.937
At first.

20:17.939 --> 20:21.941
But once I got to know you,
I realized you're great.

20:23.078 --> 20:24.744
This is a big mess.

20:24.746 --> 20:26.946
I was so ashamed,
I even lied to my bestie,

20:26.948 --> 20:28.214
Ciara, about meeting you.

20:28.216 --> 20:32.018
Wait, you just said "my bestie Ciara."

20:32.020 --> 20:34.721

20:34.723 --> 20:35.722
And she never complained

20:35.724 --> 20:38.925
whenever I'd high-five her
into the next room.

20:38.927 --> 20:41.861
So, you don't think she's
a 50 percent bestie?

she's keeping a secret from me.

20:52.974 --> 20:54.707
Do you know what it is?

20:54.709 --> 20:55.441
I'm almost positive

20:55.443 --> 20:58.911
it's that she has
a big crush on Warwick.

20:58.913 --> 21:01.247
I don't think that's it.

21:03.218 --> 21:05.752
Well, whatever her secret is,

21:05.754 --> 21:06.986
I'd never wanna pressure her into

21:06.988 --> 21:08.688
telling me before she's ready.

21:08.690 --> 21:11.824
I just hope she knows that
I'm always here for her.

21:11.826 --> 21:16.028
Look, I bet if she
was here right now, she'd say,

21:16.030 --> 21:18.798
"you are the best bestie ever.

21:18.800 --> 21:20.433
I love you so much."

21:20.435 --> 21:23.469
That is what she would say.
