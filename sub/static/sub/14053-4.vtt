00:12.200 --> 00:17.200
Simon and I are most likely to fall out in the car.

00:17.240 --> 00:18.800
-Ah... -It's like he loses his mind.

00:18.840 --> 00:21.240
I mean, amber doesn't mean speed up.

00:21.280 --> 00:22.440
It means slow down.

00:25.040 --> 00:27.880
Simon's exact words were...

00:27.920 --> 00:31.080
<i>Ah, that's easy, Sal.</i> <i>Jenny's backseat driving.</i>

00:34.440 --> 00:38.000
Okay, next question. I asked Simon...

00:38.040 --> 00:40.920
SAL: <i> Where was your</i> <i>and Jenny's first kiss?</i>

00:40.960 --> 00:43.960
Ooh. Oh, gosh! I can't remember.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.080
I think it was at a party or something.

00:47.400 --> 00:49.560
<i>Uh, it was Halloween.</i>

00:49.600 --> 00:51.280
<i>Jenny kept plying me</i> <i>with wine all night,</i>

00:51.320 --> 00:52.680
<i>and then launched</i> <i>herself at me.</i>

00:52.720 --> 00:54.360
WOMEN: Ooh!

00:54.400 --> 00:57.200
Drink, drink, drink! Drink, drink, drink, drink!

00:57.240 --> 00:59.480
Oh, no, come on. Hasn't she had enough?

00:59.520 --> 01:02.000
-We've been drinking all day. -Yeah!

01:02.040 --> 01:04.760
-SAL: Right, Jenny.

01:04.800 --> 01:08.160
Where did you and Simon consummate your relationship?

01:09.520 --> 01:10.920
Sports Centre car park.

01:27.400 --> 01:29.200
-Yes, please!

01:31.600 --> 01:33.640
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:34.920 --> 01:37.120
Oh, yeah, let me have that.

01:37.160 --> 01:38.520
MAN: No, no.

01:38.560 --> 01:40.440
No, I'm working. No, no.

01:40.480 --> 01:42.760
She's the bride-to-be! Yeah.

01:45.200 --> 01:47.600
I don't know where she gets her energy from.

01:47.640 --> 01:50.160
-Oh, excuse me.

01:52.840 --> 01:55.800
Hi, darling. It's not the best time to talk.

01:55.840 --> 01:58.040
Can I call you back tomorrow?

01:58.080 --> 02:00.880
Okay. I love you. Yeah, you too. Bye-bye.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.680
SIMON: <i> See,</i> <i>I told you it'd be cool,</i>

02:05.560 --> 02:07.680
<i>watching the same sunrise.</i>

02:08.560 --> 02:10.240
It is.

02:10.280 --> 02:12.120
<i>I love you,</i> <i>and I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

02:12.160 --> 02:13.600
I love you.

02:33.720 --> 02:37.320
Ahhh. Bride-to-be is struggling.

02:37.360 --> 02:39.800
I've still got all my packing to do.

02:39.840 --> 02:41.920
You go on, but don't forget to set your alarm.

02:41.960 --> 02:43.200
You've got an early start.

02:43.240 --> 02:44.840
Thank you.

02:45.800 --> 02:47.120
Oops!

02:48.760 --> 02:50.600
I just want to say,

02:50.640 --> 02:53.960
I have got the best bridesmaids ever.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.280
-Thank you. Night. -OTHERS: Aw...

02:56.320 --> 02:58.680
-Night-night. Sleep well. -Night.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.800
Oh, come on, we're not done yet, are we?

03:02.840 --> 03:04.320
One more drink at the bar?

03:32.080 --> 03:33.360
It just keeps ringing.

03:35.440 --> 03:36.960
She's probably overslept. I'll get her.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.920
Jenny, we need to get going!

03:50.880 --> 03:52.240
Jen!

03:57.160 --> 03:59.000
-Cheers.

03:59.520 --> 04:00.760
Jenny?

04:12.080 --> 04:14.200
Jenny

04:18.200 --> 04:19.320
Jen?

04:23.080 --> 04:24.560
I'll get help.

04:56.760 --> 05:01.200
I completely understand that this is a wonderful

04:56.760 --> 05:01.200
opportunity for you.

05:02.280 --> 05:04.480
But the simple truth is...

05:04.520 --> 05:06.840
I...  I mean, we...

05:08.360 --> 05:09.840
We...

05:09.880 --> 05:12.120
just can't manage without you.

05:14.200 --> 05:15.360
Either of you.

05:16.760 --> 05:18.040
We can't cope.

05:18.080 --> 05:20.920
That is, Camille, Camille and I...

05:22.560 --> 05:23.840
can't cope.

05:25.240 --> 05:26.400
Without you.

05:27.680 --> 05:29.120
Two.

05:29.160 --> 05:30.960
Oh, thank you, sir.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.120
Yes, you're welcome.

05:40.920 --> 05:42.880
-Yes, I am.

05:42.920 --> 05:44.360
I called for you at the beach.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.960
Oh, I... I was up early.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.440
Er, the thing is, Camille, I've been thinking

05:49.480 --> 05:51.240
-about what you said... -DWAYNE: Chief!

05:51.280 --> 05:53.200
A woman has drowned at the Dolore Sands Hotel.

05:53.240 --> 05:54.360
What?

06:01.400 --> 06:02.920
I take it you still haven't told the others

06:02.960 --> 06:05.520
about <i> le</i> offer undercover Paris?

06:05.560 --> 06:06.880
No.

06:08.320 --> 06:11.160
So, you haven't decided to take it or not yet?

06:11.200 --> 06:12.640
Not yet.

06:12.680 --> 06:14.200
Here we are.

06:19.240 --> 06:22.000
Not like you to be indecisive.

06:22.040 --> 06:24.040
Well, it's a big step, you know,

06:24.080 --> 06:26.840
leaving the island, people I care about.

06:26.880 --> 06:29.040
-Exactly. <i>-Maman</i> will be sad.

06:29.080 --> 06:30.880
Well, yes, of course. Well, we all would be.

06:32.480 --> 06:34.720
Look, if I can help you, you know you only have to ask.

06:34.760 --> 06:38.200
Well, actually, it would be good to speak to

06:34.760 --> 06:38.200
someone impartial, yes.

06:38.240 --> 06:40.080
Yes, impartial. Impartial, that's me.

06:40.120 --> 06:42.320
-Absolutely.

06:44.040 --> 06:46.800
-Mmm...

06:46.840 --> 06:48.080
Well, it's hard to say with drowning.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.240
Depends on the temperature of the water.

06:51.480 --> 06:53.400
Rigor mortis has set in.

06:53.440 --> 06:55.760
I'd estimate she's been dead at least seven hours,

06:55.800 --> 06:58.240
which puts time of death at some time before 1:00 a.m.

06:58.280 --> 07:00.040
Hang on.

07:00.080 --> 07:02.360
What's that? Looks like crystals

07:00.080 --> 07:02.360
of some sort.

07:03.080 --> 07:05.240
Um, bath salts?

07:07.600 --> 07:10.320
No bath salts in her wash bag.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.200
-Let's get a sample to the lab.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.200
-Mmm.

07:12.240 --> 07:15.160
-Apparently, she hadn't been to bed the night before.

07:12.240 --> 07:15.160
-Mmm-hmm.

07:15.200 --> 07:17.520
Is it possible she fell asleep in her bath?

07:17.560 --> 07:20.840
Yes, maybe, but one of her eyes

07:17.560 --> 07:20.840
is a little bit bloodshot,

07:20.880 --> 07:24.800
which suggests she may have been in some kind

07:20.880 --> 07:24.800
of a tussle. Also...

07:24.840 --> 07:27.200
There's a bump on the back of her head.

07:27.240 --> 07:29.680
See, I don't think this was an accident.

07:31.160 --> 07:32.360
I think she's been held under.

07:34.360 --> 07:35.600
I think this is murder.

07:44.440 --> 07:46.320
It doesn't look like a robbery.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.520
No sign of a break-in.

07:50.560 --> 07:53.680
-Just the guest,

07:50.560 --> 07:53.680
and there's a staff key.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.960
Here. Thought you might be needing this.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.680
We have an electric key system.

07:57.720 --> 07:59.720
-The duty log records all uses of the key.

07:59.760 --> 08:02.200
The only time her key was used was at 8.30 p.m.,

08:02.240 --> 08:03.800
when Jenny arrived back from dinner.

08:03.840 --> 08:06.240
Then nothing till me and her friend

08:03.840 --> 08:06.240
let ourselves in

08:06.280 --> 08:07.920
at 7:00 this morning with my staff key.

08:07.960 --> 08:10.200
So, no-one let themselves in between 8.30 p.m.

08:07.960 --> 08:10.200
and 7:00 a.m.?

08:10.240 --> 08:11.640
No.

08:11.680 --> 08:13.680
Hmm. So, she packed her bags,

08:13.720 --> 08:16.000
lit the candles, got in the bath

08:13.720 --> 08:16.000
and was drowned.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.800
-Yeah.

08:20.840 --> 08:24.280
Jenny asked for fresh ones to be delivered yesterday.

08:24.320 --> 08:26.440
How long do the candles last for?

08:27.120 --> 08:29.080
CAMILLE: Eight hours.

08:29.120 --> 08:31.400
And it flickered its last at...

08:32.400 --> 08:34.800
8:07 a.m.

08:34.840 --> 08:37.080
So, the body says she was murdered

08:34.840 --> 08:37.080
before 1:00 a.m.,

08:37.120 --> 08:38.480
but the candles were lit after midnight.

08:38.520 --> 08:39.880
Midnight to 1:00 is our golden hour.

08:39.920 --> 08:42.400
That's when she was killed. Frank, thank you.

08:42.440 --> 08:44.640
Ah, some sort of scrapbook.

08:44.680 --> 08:47.480
DWAYNE: Yeah, that's what those hen parties

08:44.680 --> 08:47.480
do nowadays, Chief.

08:47.520 --> 08:50.040
Put photos and poems in a book.

08:47.520 --> 08:50.040
You know, that sort of thing.

08:51.480 --> 08:53.480
Ah, this must be the groom.

08:53.520 --> 08:56.520
Simon Parke, he was having his stag party in St Lucia.

08:57.920 --> 08:59.160
What's that?

08:59.200 --> 09:00.720
Looks like a quiz with her fiance

09:00.760 --> 09:03.240
to see how much the couple knew about each other.

09:03.280 --> 09:04.360
It's very sweet.

09:04.400 --> 09:05.680
Poor chap.

09:05.720 --> 09:08.520
So, apart from Jenny coming back here last night

09:08.560 --> 09:12.120
and Frank letting Sal in at 7:00 a.m. this morning,

09:08.560 --> 09:12.120
no key was used.

09:12.160 --> 09:13.600
So, she opened the door to her killer.

09:13.640 --> 09:14.880
Looks like it.

09:14.920 --> 09:16.600
Yes, but she was in the bath. So, she got out

09:16.640 --> 09:18.320
to let them in.

09:20.040 --> 09:21.520
No, she couldn't have.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.920
All the towels are still in place,

09:21.560 --> 09:23.920
haven't been touched.

09:23.960 --> 09:26.480
Er, so, she let them in and then got in the bath?

09:26.520 --> 09:29.400
So, she had a bath with a visitor here?

09:26.520 --> 09:29.400
Is that something ladies do?

09:29.440 --> 09:31.680
We can only live in hope, eh, Chief?

09:31.720 --> 09:34.880
So, she let them in late at night and then bathed.

09:34.920 --> 09:36.520
She knew her killer.

09:36.560 --> 09:38.800
-Maybe it was one of her friends.

09:36.560 --> 09:38.800
-Yeah.

09:38.840 --> 09:40.400
Dwayne, Florence, bag everything up

09:40.440 --> 09:42.080
and get started on background checks.

09:42.120 --> 09:43.960
Camille, let's you and I go and meet this peep of hens.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.080
Sure.

09:46.200 --> 09:47.320
Wait.

09:50.400 --> 09:51.480
What is it?

09:53.000 --> 09:54.360
It's a cork from a wine bottle.

09:56.600 --> 09:58.880
White, I'd say, but no glasses or wine bottle here.

09:58.920 --> 10:00.720
Maybe the maid missed it when she was cleaning.

10:00.760 --> 10:02.320
Yes, could be.

10:02.360 --> 10:04.480
Well, let's get it bagged up and tested for prints.

10:04.520 --> 10:07.520
Thank you, Dwayne. Right, let's go and speak

10:04.520 --> 10:07.520
to those hens.

10:17.720 --> 10:19.480
Good morning.

10:19.520 --> 10:21.200
I'm Detective Inspector Humphrey Goodman.

10:21.240 --> 10:24.000
This is Detective Sergeant Camille Bordey.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.640
We're really sorry for your loss of your friend.

10:26.680 --> 10:29.120
Now, can I start, please, by asking who you are

10:29.160 --> 10:30.720
and how you all knew Jenny?

10:31.960 --> 10:33.640
I'm Sal Tyler.

10:33.680 --> 10:37.920
Jenny and I were best mates since primary school.

10:37.960 --> 10:42.200
Elizabeth Foss. People call me Betty.

10:37.960 --> 10:42.200
Best mates since uni.

10:42.240 --> 10:45.760
Ivy Marcel. Jenny was my little brother's fiancee.

10:45.800 --> 10:47.240
You're Simon Parke's sister?

10:47.280 --> 10:48.840
Yeah.

10:48.880 --> 10:51.120
He's in a terrible state,

10:48.880 --> 10:51.120
poor love.

10:51.160 --> 10:52.880
He's on his way over here now.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.520
And he's been in St Lucia all week?

10:54.560 --> 10:56.760
-Yeah. -HUMPHREY: I see.

10:56.800 --> 10:59.320
So, after Jenny returned to her suite at 8:30,

10:59.360 --> 11:00.880
can I ask where you all were?

11:00.920 --> 11:02.680
We stayed up for a couple of drinks.

11:02.720 --> 11:04.920
-OTHERS: Oh...

11:06.000 --> 11:08.080
-Oh, one, then. Come on. -BETTY: Come on.

11:08.120 --> 11:10.000
What time till?

11:10.040 --> 11:13.600
Not late. We were all exhausted, 10:00?

11:13.640 --> 11:15.960
And you're all staying in suites near to Jenny's?

11:16.000 --> 11:19.200
Oh, no, um, well, we're in the main building.

11:19.240 --> 11:22.280
I got Jenny an upgrade as a special hen treat.

11:22.320 --> 11:23.800
And after turning in,

11:23.840 --> 11:26.000
did any of you leave your rooms again

11:23.840 --> 11:26.000
before this morning?

11:27.280 --> 11:28.960
No.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.240
Sorry, are we being accused of something?

11:33.560 --> 11:37.360
Um...  We think that Jenny

11:33.560 --> 11:37.360
had a visitor last night.

11:39.920 --> 11:43.600
We suspect that her drowning wasn't an accident.

11:43.640 --> 11:46.800
Oh, that's crazy. Why would someone

11:43.640 --> 11:46.800
do that to her?

11:46.840 --> 11:50.120
Did Jenny have any rows with anyone on the island?

11:50.160 --> 11:52.880
No, we, we haven't really hung out with other guests.

11:52.920 --> 11:55.200
We just kept ourselves to ourselves.

11:55.240 --> 11:57.480
And any rows within the group?

11:59.280 --> 12:01.160
None of us would hurt Jenny. We loved her.

12:01.200 --> 12:03.480
We were having an amazing holiday together.

12:04.360 --> 12:06.360
We're her best friends.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.560
Sal, are they allowed to question us

12:08.600 --> 12:09.720
like we're suspects?

12:09.760 --> 12:11.600
Do we need lawyers?

12:11.640 --> 12:13.640
Sal's a solicitor.

12:13.680 --> 12:15.400
I'm sure they're just establishing the facts.

12:15.440 --> 12:17.240
Quite. Okay.

12:18.200 --> 12:19.240
Thank you.

12:20.760 --> 12:22.520
Oh, uh, one last thing.

12:22.560 --> 12:25.840
Have you been socialising in Jenny's suite this

12:22.560 --> 12:25.840
week at all?

12:25.880 --> 12:27.440
Drinking wine in there, perhaps?

12:27.480 --> 12:31.400
Uh, no. We always met in the bar or restaurant.

12:33.640 --> 12:34.960
Okay, thank you.

12:38.400 --> 12:40.080
They've only been here five days.

12:40.120 --> 12:41.320
They don't know anyone else.

12:41.360 --> 12:43.480
So, if it wasn't one of them, who was it?

12:45.560 --> 12:48.800
This hen party all claim they didn't leave their rooms

12:45.560 --> 12:48.800
after 10:00 last night.

12:48.840 --> 12:51.400
Do you have that key recording system on all the rooms?

12:51.440 --> 12:53.640
Er, sorry. It's only on the suites.

12:53.680 --> 12:56.520
But we have got CCTV on every corridor on

12:53.680 --> 12:56.520
the main building.

12:56.560 --> 12:59.000
-I'll sort you a disc. -Oh, thank you.

13:01.160 --> 13:05.040
Um, you must have seen the hens around the hotel

13:01.160 --> 13:05.040
this last week.

13:05.080 --> 13:07.760
Er, any tensions at all? Any fallings out,

13:05.080 --> 13:07.760
that kind of thing?

13:07.800 --> 13:11.280
Not that I noticed. They seemed to be

13:07.800 --> 13:11.280
having a great time.

13:11.320 --> 13:12.920
There we go.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.880
That's the first floor corridor.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.880
Should be the last 24 hours.

13:14.920 --> 13:17.120
-Thank you, Frank. You've been most helpful.

13:14.920 --> 13:17.120
-No problem.

13:26.200 --> 13:27.560
They've gone.

13:28.440 --> 13:30.000
It's fine.

13:30.040 --> 13:31.280
I did it.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.280
Well, Chief, I've dusted the cork.

13:38.320 --> 13:39.640
There are a couple of partials, but

13:39.680 --> 13:41.280
nowhere near enough to get a match.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.000
Oh, well, thanks for trying.

13:43.040 --> 13:46.280
But I do have the CCTV footage of the corridor

13:43.040 --> 13:46.280
all lined up for you,

13:46.320 --> 13:47.960
and it's like the bridesmaids said.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.640
According to the time code, they all went to bed

13:48.000 --> 13:51.640
at 10:02.

13:51.680 --> 13:53.440
Well, the golden hour is midnight to 1:00,

13:53.480 --> 13:56.160
so fast-forward the tape and see if anyone leaves

13:53.480 --> 13:56.160
their room before then.

13:56.200 --> 13:57.680
-No problem, Chief. -Right,

13:57.720 --> 13:59.800
so, let's see what we've got so far.

13:59.840 --> 14:02.880
Suspects. Ivy Marcel, older sister of the groom

14:02.920 --> 14:04.640
and the victim's future sister-in-law.

14:04.680 --> 14:06.240
40, married, with two kids.

14:06.280 --> 14:09.360
She runs a physio practice with her husband in Surrey.

14:09.400 --> 14:11.720
Ah, that'll be the "why is she here" girl.

14:12.400 --> 14:13.880
Every hen party has one.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.440
She's usually related to the groom,

14:15.480 --> 14:17.560
wears terrible clothes, doesn't know anybody

14:17.600 --> 14:19.520
and hates hen parties.

14:19.560 --> 14:22.080
Dwayne, how do you know so much about hen dos?

14:22.120 --> 14:25.440
A great magician never reveals his secrets.

14:25.480 --> 14:28.120
Elizabeth Foss, "Betty", the uni friend.

14:28.160 --> 14:30.600
FLORENCE: 28, single, works as

14:30.640 --> 14:32.680
a loss adjuster for an insurance company.

14:32.720 --> 14:35.000
Couple of cautions for drunk and disorderly.

14:35.920 --> 14:37.560
And there's always a Betty.

14:37.600 --> 14:41.080
Dwayne. And Sal Tyler, best friend since school.

14:48.600 --> 14:51.160
29. Grew up with Jenny in Eastbourne.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.000
Never moved away, and she's also single.

14:53.040 --> 14:54.320
Thank you, Florence.

14:54.360 --> 14:57.520
So, at 8:30 on the last night of her hen week,

14:57.560 --> 15:01.400
Jenny Burgess bids good night to her bridesmaids

14:57.560 --> 15:01.400
and retires to her bedroom.

15:01.440 --> 15:03.440
CAMILLE: At some point between midnight and 1:00 a.m.,

15:03.480 --> 15:05.120
she lets her killer into the room

15:05.160 --> 15:06.640
and then takes a bath in front of them.

15:06.680 --> 15:08.240
She, or possibly he,

15:08.280 --> 15:10.200
holds Jenny underwater and drowns her.

15:10.240 --> 15:13.560
And she's then discovered dead at

15:10.240 --> 15:13.560
7:00 a.m. the next morning.

15:13.600 --> 15:14.920
HUMPHREY: Which leaves us with the question,

15:14.960 --> 15:16.640
who would kill a bride-to-be

15:16.680 --> 15:19.240
the night before she flies home from her hen week?

15:16.680 --> 15:19.240
And why?

15:19.280 --> 15:21.560
Oh, Commissioner. I didn't see you arrive.

15:21.600 --> 15:22.760
Have you been there long?

15:22.800 --> 15:24.000
Long enough.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.080
-Good morning, team. -Commissioner.

15:27.120 --> 15:28.720
-Sir. -Good morning.

15:28.760 --> 15:32.560
I wonder if you could spare me a few moments

15:28.760 --> 15:32.560
of your time, Inspector?

15:32.600 --> 15:36.160
Yes, of course. Er, a moment, please, sir.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.800
Er, Florence, could you make a start on the financial

15:36.200 --> 15:38.800
checks, please?

15:38.840 --> 15:40.240
FLORENCE: Yes, sir.

15:47.440 --> 15:49.400
Commissioner.

15:49.440 --> 15:51.680
I'm here to talk about Sergeant Bordey.

15:52.440 --> 15:55.040
Ah. So, you know?

15:55.080 --> 15:57.920
I've had a formal request to release her.

15:57.960 --> 16:00.160
But she hasn't decided if she's going yet.

16:00.200 --> 16:01.760
Nevertheless,

16:01.800 --> 16:04.760
she can't go unless we agree to the transfer,

16:05.240 --> 16:07.040
by, erm,

16:07.080 --> 16:09.080
signing this release form.

16:10.680 --> 16:11.840
I see.

16:12.960 --> 16:14.760
And will you sign it?

16:17.360 --> 16:19.280
It's not for me to do so.

16:19.320 --> 16:23.080
That responsibility rests with her immediate superior.

16:23.400 --> 16:24.480
Me?

16:25.800 --> 16:29.120
I'm sure we agree she's a brilliant officer.

16:31.200 --> 16:32.760
Well, well, yes, of course, sir.

16:32.800 --> 16:35.320
She's, um, you know, the best.

16:35.360 --> 16:38.400
Quite. This release form,

16:38.440 --> 16:40.360
whether it's signed or not,

16:41.240 --> 16:42.520
is at your discretion.

16:45.480 --> 16:46.600
She'd hate me.

16:48.080 --> 16:50.560
It would be in complete confidence.

16:50.600 --> 16:52.320
If you refused to release her,

16:52.360 --> 16:55.720
she would simply be told that the offer has been withdrawn.

17:00.560 --> 17:03.080
No, I can't. I can't. I...

17:03.120 --> 17:05.240
Excellent.

17:05.280 --> 17:07.840
I will leave it in your capable hands.

17:13.160 --> 17:15.960
I'm sure you'll do the right thing,

17:13.160 --> 17:15.960
Inspector.

17:26.720 --> 17:28.280
Everything's okay?

17:28.320 --> 17:29.720
Yes, fine.

17:31.840 --> 17:33.320
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,

17:33.360 --> 17:35.200
but none of the hens leave their room during the night.

17:35.240 --> 17:36.720
Are you sure, Dwayne?

17:36.760 --> 17:38.280
I've just gone from where they go into their rooms at 10:00,

17:38.320 --> 17:41.080
and nobody left till 6:55 in the morning.

17:41.120 --> 17:43.280
Well, then, how did one of them kill Jenny?

17:46.320 --> 17:49.640
-I think I've found something

17:46.320 --> 17:49.640
in the hen book photos.

17:49.680 --> 17:51.160
Ah, Jenny's 21st.

17:51.200 --> 17:54.640
Sure. And everyone is toasting for Jenny and Simon here,

17:54.680 --> 17:56.000
except for Betty.

17:56.040 --> 17:58.000
It really looks like she doesn't want to watch.

17:58.040 --> 18:00.680
Hmm, interesting. Well, it's something.

18:01.880 --> 18:03.520
Simon Parke has just arrived from St Lucia.

18:03.560 --> 18:06.120
-Ah, erm... -Let's go.

18:06.160 --> 18:09.160
Yes? Okay.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.920
Ivy says you don't think it was an accident.

18:11.960 --> 18:13.200
Someone did this to Jenny.

18:14.800 --> 18:17.400
Let me get you some water. You look exhausted.

18:19.680 --> 18:22.360
Yes, it's true that we think she was murdered.

18:22.400 --> 18:24.680
We also think it was someone who knew her.

18:25.560 --> 18:27.040
Someone she knew?

18:29.760 --> 18:33.400
-No.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.480
Wait. She, she called me last night around 7:00.

18:38.520 --> 18:41.280
Said there was something we need to talk about

18:38.520 --> 18:41.280
when we're on our own.

18:41.320 --> 18:42.680
Do you know what it was about?

18:42.720 --> 18:44.240
No, she wouldn't say.

18:47.680 --> 18:48.920
Excuse me.

18:50.640 --> 18:54.360
Were there any issues between Betty and Jenny at university?

18:57.840 --> 19:01.920
Simon used to go out with Betty before

18:57.840 --> 19:01.920
he went out with Jenny.

19:01.960 --> 19:04.000
-I see. -IVY: It was a long time ago.

19:04.040 --> 19:06.320
It was seven, eight years?

19:06.360 --> 19:07.480
Ten.

19:07.520 --> 19:09.600
If I'm honest, we all thought

19:09.640 --> 19:11.280
she still held a bit of a candle for him.

19:11.680 --> 19:13.080
No way.

19:13.120 --> 19:16.280
So, you were in a relationship with Betty

19:16.320 --> 19:20.320
Er, we met the first year at Uni.

19:20.360 --> 19:23.960
Got together at a Valentine's party

19:20.360 --> 19:23.960
and split up around Christmas.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.640
So, it wasn't even a year.

19:25.680 --> 19:28.800
How did Betty react when you started dating her friend?

19:28.840 --> 19:30.240
It was kind of tricky for a while.

19:30.280 --> 19:32.360
They were really close.

19:32.400 --> 19:35.440
It was a pretty bloody awful time, actually.

19:35.480 --> 19:37.280
But Jenny got her through it.

19:37.320 --> 19:38.960
I think they became closer, if anything.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.680
Thank you for your time, Simon.

19:43.360 --> 19:45.840
Uh, please call if there's anything at all.

19:48.840 --> 19:49.920
CAMILLE: <i> Merci.</i>

19:49.960 --> 19:51.800
That was Florence.

19:51.840 --> 19:54.360
The lab in Guadeloupe have been able to

19:51.840 --> 19:54.360
identify five fingerprints

19:54.400 --> 19:57.040
on the inside front door handle to Jenny's suite,

19:57.080 --> 19:59.120
and three of them belong to Jenny.

19:59.160 --> 20:00.680
The other two?

20:00.720 --> 20:01.800
Betty Foss.

20:09.560 --> 20:12.680
We didn't find any cash in Jenny's suite, did we?

20:12.720 --> 20:16.560
Uh, no, Jenny put everything on the tab,

20:12.720 --> 20:16.560
according to the resort.

20:16.600 --> 20:18.480
But according to this bank statement,

20:18.520 --> 20:22.160
she withdrew $6,000 out of the <i>bureau de change</i> two days ago.

20:24.520 --> 20:26.480
Uh, you want me to go down to the bureau

20:26.520 --> 20:29.880
and see if she, or he, knows anything about it?

20:29.920 --> 20:32.640
Maybe let's go and search Jenny's suite again first.

20:32.680 --> 20:34.440
Make sure we didn't miss anything.

20:34.480 --> 20:36.240
Sure thing, Sarge.

20:36.280 --> 20:38.440
But if we don't find the $6,000 there,

20:38.480 --> 20:41.400
and you want me to go down to the bureau

20:38.480 --> 20:41.400
and interview the cashier,

20:41.440 --> 20:43.040
it's not a problem, you know.

20:43.080 --> 20:44.800
Just say the word.

20:53.840 --> 20:55.520
Excuse me. Betty?

20:57.480 --> 21:00.120
Why didn't you tell us you and Simon were an item?

21:00.160 --> 21:01.720
Does it matter? Must have been tough.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.400
Things end with Simon,

21:06.440 --> 21:08.000
and then he's with your friend.

21:09.160 --> 21:10.960
It was all civilised.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.600
Jenny even asked my permission before

21:11.000 --> 21:14.600
she went on a date with him.

21:14.640 --> 21:18.480
She'd never have gone anywhere near him if I hadn't

21:14.640 --> 21:18.480
said it was okay.

21:18.520 --> 21:22.560
So, you did still have feelings for Simon when

21:18.520 --> 21:22.560
he started dating Jenny?

21:24.640 --> 21:26.880
Jenny was my best friend.

21:26.920 --> 21:29.720
So, I pretended it was fine,

21:29.760 --> 21:33.520
and you know what? It was a sacrifice

21:29.760 --> 21:33.520
worth making.

21:33.560 --> 21:36.480
You only get one best friend in life,

21:33.560 --> 21:36.480
and Jenny was mine.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.360
Hmm.

21:38.400 --> 21:40.320
So, can you tell us why we found your prints

21:40.360 --> 21:42.720
on the inside of the door handle in Jenny's suite?

21:46.920 --> 21:48.680
Oh, yeah, of course.

21:48.720 --> 21:51.760
I, uh, popped by to pick her up

21:48.720 --> 21:51.760
for the pool yesterday.

21:51.800 --> 21:53.640
You look great. Come on, chop-chop.

21:55.320 --> 21:57.840
BETTY: <i> I was literally there</i> <i>for two seconds, no more.</i>

22:02.360 --> 22:05.840
I don't love Simon, and I haven't for

22:02.360 --> 22:05.840
a very long time.

22:08.440 --> 22:09.720
But I did love Jenny.

22:12.120 --> 22:13.560
Very much.

22:17.120 --> 22:19.280
FLORENCE: The money's definitely not here.

22:19.320 --> 22:20.640
There was no break-in.

22:20.680 --> 22:23.400
Jenny put everything on her bill.

22:23.440 --> 22:26.280
How do you lose $6,000 in a day?

22:27.200 --> 22:29.200
I wouldn't mind giving it a try.

22:30.480 --> 22:33.360
I think we've hit a brick wall here, you know.

22:33.400 --> 22:34.920
I suppose the only thing now

22:34.960 --> 22:38.000
is for me to go and check it out at the <i> bureau de change.</i>

22:38.040 --> 22:40.840
Hopefully, it will shed some light on it all. Okay?

22:44.200 --> 22:48.280
This isn't anything to do with the new cashier I hear

22:44.200 --> 22:48.280
is working there?

22:48.320 --> 22:51.000
-Uh... -Gloria, I believe,

22:48.320 --> 22:51.000
is her name?

22:52.160 --> 22:54.320
Uh, really

22:55.120 --> 22:56.600
And she's new?

22:57.720 --> 22:59.440
Hmm, I didn't know that.

22:59.480 --> 23:00.880
Mmm-hmm.

23:10.200 --> 23:11.760
-HUMPHREY:

23:10.200 --> 23:11.760
<i>Yes, are you nearby?</i>

23:11.800 --> 23:14.200
Yes, actually, I'm at the hotel right now.

23:14.240 --> 23:16.360
<i></i>

23:14.240 --> 23:16.360
-Okay.

23:18.920 --> 23:21.400
Jenny was killed between midnight and 1:00 a.m.

23:21.440 --> 23:23.640
Yes, but the CCTV proves the hens

23:23.680 --> 23:26.240
didn't leave their rooms until 7:00 a.m.

23:23.680 --> 23:26.240
the next morning.

23:26.280 --> 23:28.480
HUMPHREY: Well, it had to be one of the hens.

23:28.520 --> 23:30.520
So, a bottle of beer to whoever can work out

23:30.560 --> 23:33.760
how someone can get out of their room without

23:30.560 --> 23:33.760
being caught on CCTV.

23:33.800 --> 23:36.600
Uh, there's an obvious answer, but, er...

23:36.640 --> 23:39.680
Do you really want us to try?

23:39.720 --> 23:43.160
Uh, no, no, a general always leads from the front.

23:43.200 --> 23:45.720
No! Okay, uh, sir, I don't think

23:43.200 --> 23:45.720
that's a good idea!

23:45.760 --> 23:47.440
You can barely walk in a straight line.

23:47.480 --> 23:49.280
Rubbish. I'm like a pigeon.

23:49.320 --> 23:52.320
Cumbersome over land, but very agile

23:49.320 --> 23:52.320
through the air.

23:52.360 --> 23:54.200
CAMILLE: No, no, no, sir! I'm serious!

23:54.240 --> 23:56.720
Come back over! You could injure yourself.

23:56.760 --> 23:58.720
FLORENCE: Sir, she's right. It's really not safe.

23:58.760 --> 24:00.840
No, nonsense! I'm just getting my bearings.

24:01.920 --> 24:04.280
-Oh! -Okay, stop! That's it!

24:04.320 --> 24:06.320
We're coming round, and do not move!

24:06.360 --> 24:08.160
HUMPHREY: No, I'm fine! No need to panic!

24:08.200 --> 24:09.600
Oh.

24:11.080 --> 24:12.360
Oh.

24:12.400 --> 24:14.160
Oh, my... No! Humphrey!

24:16.640 --> 24:19.160
I'm fine. Don't panic. I am perfectly fine.

24:28.480 --> 24:30.480
-Ah. -Oh!

24:30.520 --> 24:33.560
You could have got yourself killed!

24:33.600 --> 24:36.040
How can I go to Paris? You wouldn't survive a week.

24:36.080 --> 24:37.480
No, I very probably wouldn't.

24:38.480 --> 24:40.880
Right, so, although we've proved

24:40.920 --> 24:43.760
that the killer could get down without being seen on CCTV,

24:43.800 --> 24:45.840
I can't really see how they'd do it injury-free,

24:45.880 --> 24:48.240
and none of the hens look scratched or injured to me.

24:48.280 --> 24:50.040
Yeah, even if they did manage it,

24:50.080 --> 24:51.240
how did they get back up?

24:51.280 --> 24:52.360
Mmm.

24:53.640 --> 24:55.960
That was the pathologist's office.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.320
They are confirming Jenny died from drowning

24:58.360 --> 25:00.160
and the bump on her head is consistent

25:00.200 --> 25:02.160
with being held underwater.

25:02.200 --> 25:05.520
-Mmm. -So, you are right.

25:02.200 --> 25:05.520
It's a murder.

25:05.560 --> 25:08.160
Now, we should call it a day. You need a plaster on that.

25:08.200 --> 25:10.760
Yes, probably a good idea. Let's approach it fresh

25:08.200 --> 25:10.760
in the morning

25:10.800 --> 25:12.720
and see if Dwayne comes up with some new leads for us.

25:12.760 --> 25:15.320
Right, let's see if I can still walk.

25:15.360 --> 25:16.800
Ow.

25:17.880 --> 25:19.080
Ah, that's fine.

25:30.200 --> 25:31.480
Give me your knee.

25:31.520 --> 25:33.480
Uh, yes.  Ow.

25:37.320 --> 25:39.240
So, have you made a decision?

25:39.280 --> 25:40.560
About the new job?

25:41.600 --> 25:43.000
They need to know by tomorrow.

25:43.040 --> 25:44.320
Yes, and?

25:45.160 --> 25:46.200
Ow.

25:47.560 --> 25:51.800
And my head tells me that a move to Paris

25:51.840 --> 25:53.800
is the best thing for my career,

25:54.520 --> 25:55.720
and yet...

25:55.760 --> 25:58.480
my heart says stay.

25:58.520 --> 25:59.680
Does it?

26:01.280 --> 26:03.160
-Yes. -Well, then, to help you,

26:03.200 --> 26:06.080
we should make a pros and cons list.

26:06.120 --> 26:09.120
-Uh, pros and cons,

26:06.120 --> 26:09.120
for and against.

26:12.320 --> 26:13.880
-Yes.

26:14.760 --> 26:18.160
So, reasons to move to Paris.

26:21.440 --> 26:22.560
I like cheese.

26:22.600 --> 26:24.280
Ah, <i> fromage.</i> Excellent choice, madam.

26:24.320 --> 26:26.080
May I suggest the <i> vin rouge?</i> This is ridiculous.

26:27.920 --> 26:31.480
Okay. If you're stumped, then we should move to the

26:27.920 --> 26:31.480
"stay put" column.

26:32.320 --> 26:34.040
Well, that's easy.

26:35.440 --> 26:37.880
-My mum. -Right. So, the, uh,

26:37.920 --> 26:41.120
current roundup is, is your mum versus cheese.

26:45.680 --> 26:47.440
How's the leg?

26:47.480 --> 26:49.760
Uh, yes, much better, now I can't feel anything

26:47.480 --> 26:49.760
below the knee.

26:52.400 --> 26:53.760
So, uh, tell me, Catherine...

26:55.080 --> 26:57.800
How do you feel about this Paris business?

26:57.840 --> 27:00.000
I think Camille should make up her own mind.

27:01.360 --> 27:04.680
Yes, well, come on. You must have an opinion.

27:04.720 --> 27:09.120
Obviously, I wish I could keep my daughter

27:04.720 --> 27:09.120
in my pocket for ever.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.680
But if Paris is what she wants,

27:11.720 --> 27:13.440
I love her too much to keep her.

27:14.680 --> 27:15.800
Yes.

27:16.600 --> 27:18.000
Maybe <i> Maman</i> is right.

27:18.040 --> 27:21.200
Maybe this is something I need to decide for myself.

27:31.360 --> 27:33.080
-Oh, morning, sir. -Morning.

27:33.120 --> 27:34.840
Um, could we, um...

27:34.880 --> 27:37.000
Er, yes, of course.

27:37.040 --> 27:38.240
Thanks.

27:52.360 --> 27:53.800
So, have you decided?

27:55.320 --> 27:56.440
Yes.

27:58.160 --> 27:59.840
I need to go.

27:59.880 --> 28:02.240
It's such a good opportunity for me.

28:05.160 --> 28:07.720
Sir, say something.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.480
Say something.

28:20.640 --> 28:22.360
Uh, well, yes.

28:22.400 --> 28:25.520
I... I'm very happy for you.

28:25.560 --> 28:29.320
And, of course, I'll... I'll be sad to see you go.

28:25.560 --> 28:29.320
We all will.

28:29.360 --> 28:31.800
But, as you say, it's a great opportunity.

28:33.240 --> 28:34.360
Thank you.

28:35.320 --> 28:36.680
You're very welcome.

28:38.720 --> 28:41.040
Now, let's go and catch ourselves a killer.

28:44.960 --> 28:47.480
Now focus. Focus.

28:47.520 --> 28:50.080
Uh... Ah, yes.

28:50.120 --> 28:51.720
Now, why was there a cork on the floor

28:51.760 --> 28:53.680
underneath the chair of the victim's bedroom?

28:53.720 --> 28:55.760
There has to be a reason.

28:56.400 --> 28:57.840
Ah. Morning, Dwayne.

28:57.880 --> 28:59.520
Morning, Chief. Sarge. Sarge.

28:59.560 --> 29:02.320
So, tell me, how did you get on with your lead last night?

29:02.360 --> 29:04.200
Pretty good, I'd say.

29:04.240 --> 29:06.920
I reckon we might have a possible suspect

29:04.240 --> 29:06.920
on our hands.

29:06.960 --> 29:09.080
Really? That's fantastic.

29:09.120 --> 29:10.680
I spoke to the cashier at the <i> bureau de change,</i>

29:10.720 --> 29:12.960
where Jenny withdrew the $6,000.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.160
Did she remember anything?

29:14.200 --> 29:15.920
She remembered plenty.

29:15.960 --> 29:18.120
She had to think twice about handing over

29:15.960 --> 29:18.120
that amount of money

29:18.160 --> 29:21.320
to someone who was being accompanied by

29:18.160 --> 29:21.320
an angry friend.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.800
Your contact thought Jenny was being intimidated?

29:23.840 --> 29:26.400
Look, all Gloria knows is that Jenny and another woman

29:26.440 --> 29:28.720
had an argument before going inside the bureau.

29:28.760 --> 29:31.600
Jenny then withdrew the money and handed it to the woman.

29:31.640 --> 29:33.160
Did the cashier give a description?

29:33.200 --> 29:35.000
She did one better than that, Chief.

29:35.040 --> 29:37.440
She gave it to me in glorious technicolor.

29:39.600 --> 29:40.720
Gosh. That's Sal Tyler...

29:40.760 --> 29:42.800
-Yeah. -Jenny's old school friend.

29:42.840 --> 29:44.920
Uh, Florence, have we managed to get

29:42.840 --> 29:44.920
anything on her?

29:45.440 --> 29:46.760
No, not really.

29:46.800 --> 29:48.800
She's a secretary at a law firm.

29:48.840 --> 29:50.880
She doesn't earn a huge amount.

29:50.920 --> 29:52.680
Well, hang on. Did you just say

29:50.920 --> 29:52.680
she was a secretary?

29:52.720 --> 29:54.720
Uh, team secretary.

29:54.760 --> 29:56.840
That's what the person I spoke to called her.

29:56.880 --> 29:59.480
Then why did she let Ivy tell us she was a solicitor?

29:59.520 --> 30:02.440
Florence, Dwayne, check Jenny's

29:59.520 --> 30:02.440
mobile phone records

30:02.480 --> 30:05.160
and follow up with the lab about the crystals we found

30:02.480 --> 30:05.160
on the bath.

30:05.200 --> 30:06.600
-Chief. -Sir.

30:15.560 --> 30:19.080
-Yes.

30:19.120 --> 30:21.000
-Oh, um... -Oh, good morning,

30:19.120 --> 30:21.000
Commissioner.

30:21.040 --> 30:22.360
-Commissioner. -Sir.

30:22.400 --> 30:24.160
Good morning, team.

30:25.440 --> 30:26.680
I'll catch you up.

30:30.360 --> 30:31.480
Sir.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.760
-I've had Paris on the telephone.

30:35.800 --> 30:38.280
They want to know if we're releasing

30:35.800 --> 30:38.280
Sergeant Bordey.

30:41.520 --> 30:42.640
Well?

30:44.120 --> 30:46.160
No, sir. No, we're not.

30:46.200 --> 30:47.520
She's far too valuable to my team.

30:47.560 --> 30:49.360
I won't be signing the release form.

30:50.400 --> 30:51.560
I see. Excellent.

30:54.560 --> 30:57.040
-I'll let them know. -Thank you.

30:57.080 --> 30:58.680
Is that all, sir?

30:58.720 --> 31:00.120
Yes, it is.

31:01.120 --> 31:02.320
Thank you.

31:08.040 --> 31:09.640
-No, no problem.

31:09.680 --> 31:10.920
Come on.

31:15.720 --> 31:18.280
I understand that you're a solicitor.

31:15.720 --> 31:18.280
Is that right?

31:24.840 --> 31:27.280
It's just that we were wondering...

31:27.320 --> 31:30.680
Why did Jenny give you $6,000 the day before she died?

31:32.520 --> 31:36.760
We have a witness who says you forced Jenny to

31:32.520 --> 31:36.760
give you the money.

31:36.800 --> 31:39.520
I didn't force Jenny. I didn't even want it.

31:39.560 --> 31:42.720
Then tell me this, seeing as you're actually

31:39.560 --> 31:42.720
a secretary

31:42.760 --> 31:45.040
and you've been lying about being a solicitor,

31:45.080 --> 31:47.480
why on earth should we believe a single word you're saying?

31:47.520 --> 31:50.160
I think it's time you started to tell us the truth.

31:54.640 --> 31:57.520
Okay, the solicitor thing, right, it's

31:57.560 --> 31:59.640
something I told Jenny a couple of years ago.

32:01.320 --> 32:02.440
Why?

32:05.720 --> 32:08.320
Jenny and I were best mates since playschool.

32:09.880 --> 32:12.480
But when she went off to uni, we drifted apart.

32:13.760 --> 32:16.120
Two years ago, we eventually got back in touch,

32:16.160 --> 32:19.200
and it turns out she was doing really well for herself.

32:22.400 --> 32:25.560
It shouldn't have mattered, but when we first met again

32:25.600 --> 32:28.080
I wanted her to think that I'd achieved something too.

32:29.880 --> 32:32.760
So, when she asked, I lied.

32:32.800 --> 32:35.920
I told her I'd gone to night school and been

32:32.800 --> 32:35.920
promoted up to solicitor.

32:39.120 --> 32:41.000
How did you afford this holiday?

32:42.160 --> 32:43.520
I didn't.

32:44.520 --> 32:45.920
I took out a payday loan.

32:48.600 --> 32:52.920
I'm in so much trouble when I get home. Oh!

32:52.960 --> 32:56.200
But then Jenny found out I'd maxed out

32:52.960 --> 32:56.200
all my credit cards.

32:56.240 --> 32:58.120
MAN: Sorry, madam. This card has been declined.

32:58.160 --> 33:00.560
Can I try this one again, please?

33:00.600 --> 33:03.240
MAN: Sorry, madam. This card won't work.

33:00.600 --> 33:03.240
Do you have another?

33:03.280 --> 33:04.600
Is there a problem, Sal?

33:11.280 --> 33:13.880
So, you had to ask Jenny for a loan?

33:14.720 --> 33:16.480
No.

33:16.520 --> 33:20.480
She insisted on giving me the cash to cover the holiday.

33:20.520 --> 33:23.520
She was so understanding, but that just made

33:20.520 --> 33:23.520
it all worse.

33:24.400 --> 33:26.000
That's what your witness saw,

33:26.040 --> 33:29.200
me just taking my embarrassment out on her.

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
I missed Jenny so much when she went off to university.

33:36.680 --> 33:40.320
I only lied because I wanted us to go back

33:36.680 --> 33:40.320
to the way we were.

33:42.040 --> 33:44.560
I want Jenny back in my life, not dead.

33:48.800 --> 33:51.800
So, Dwayne, what happened with you and Gloria?

33:51.840 --> 33:53.760
Did you manage to get her phone number?

33:53.800 --> 33:55.040
I don't know what you mean, Sarge.

33:56.680 --> 33:59.920
Okay, look, I really don't want to be indiscreet.

33:59.960 --> 34:02.120
But let's just say,

34:02.160 --> 34:05.120
I might be putting a call in to the <i> bureau de change</i>

34:02.160 --> 34:05.120
before the end of the day.

34:05.160 --> 34:06.960
Very impressive, Officer Myers.

34:11.440 --> 34:14.360
We chased Jenny's phone records, like you said.

34:14.400 --> 34:15.800
You should see them.

34:15.840 --> 34:17.760
They make for interesting reading,

34:17.800 --> 34:20.560
because two voicemail messages were left on her mobile

34:20.600 --> 34:21.760
from a hotel landline,

34:21.800 --> 34:23.880
before midnight on the night of the murder.

34:23.920 --> 34:25.720
-FLORENCE: I know.

34:25.760 --> 34:27.880
Just before the candles were lit and she was killed.

34:27.920 --> 34:29.560
Have you accessed her voicemail?

34:29.600 --> 34:30.800
They have been deleted.

34:30.840 --> 34:32.440
But, according to the record,

34:32.480 --> 34:33.920
she accessed and deleted them

34:33.960 --> 34:36.240
at 7:15 a.m. the following morning.

34:36.280 --> 34:40.280
Wait, wait, wait. She accessed her voicemails

34:36.280 --> 34:40.280
after she was dead?

34:40.320 --> 34:43.040
Ah, but Florence came up with the idea

34:43.080 --> 34:45.680
of dusting the screen of Jenny's phone to see

34:43.080 --> 34:45.680
who else had used it.

34:45.720 --> 34:47.560
And have you got a match yet?

34:47.600 --> 34:48.760
I'm working on it now.

34:55.600 --> 34:58.680
Honore Police Station. Yes, this is Camille Bordey.

34:58.720 --> 34:59.800
Oh.

35:02.440 --> 35:04.080
Um, yeah, all right.

35:04.120 --> 35:06.800
Thank you for letting me know.

35:08.160 --> 35:09.240
Is everything okay?

35:09.760 --> 35:11.840
Yes.

35:11.880 --> 35:15.680
Well, it seems that the job in Paris is no longer

35:11.880 --> 35:15.680
on the table.

35:16.840 --> 35:20.840
Oh. Did they say why?

35:20.880 --> 35:24.160
Just that they are looking for someone already

35:20.880 --> 35:24.160
living in Paris.

35:26.400 --> 35:27.480
Are you disappointed?

35:29.600 --> 35:30.840
Yes.

35:33.400 --> 35:35.640
But if it's not meant to be...

35:36.960 --> 35:39.240
<i>C'est la vie.</i>

35:41.400 --> 35:42.920
DWAYNE: I've found a match.

35:44.760 --> 35:47.640
Then who was it who called Jenny's voicemail

35:44.760 --> 35:47.640
after she died?

35:47.680 --> 35:49.160
The duty manager,

35:49.200 --> 35:50.480
Frank.

35:50.520 --> 35:51.840
We have pretty compelling evidence,

35:51.880 --> 35:53.920
so I'd think hard before you deny it.

35:57.080 --> 35:59.520
The voicemails weren't from me.

35:59.560 --> 36:01.040
They were from Ivy.

36:02.960 --> 36:05.080
We got chatting at the bar.

36:06.240 --> 36:07.680
She was a laugh, once she loosened up.

36:08.760 --> 36:10.320
We got on to her life back home,

36:10.360 --> 36:13.400
how she's only got two toddlers for company.

36:13.440 --> 36:14.760
She wanted to let loose.

36:14.800 --> 36:16.760
I wasn't going to say no.

36:16.800 --> 36:18.360
-Shh.

36:19.360 --> 36:20.560
Mmm!

36:23.360 --> 36:25.040
FRANK: <i> Things were a bit</i> <i>awkward when we woke up.</i>

36:25.080 --> 36:27.680
<i>I don't think Ivy was feeling</i> <i>too proud of herself.</i>

36:27.720 --> 36:30.600
<i>She'd forgotten she'd planned</i> <i>to go for a jog with Jenny.</i>

36:32.600 --> 36:35.680
Ivy had been begging Jenny not to tell her husband.

36:35.720 --> 36:38.080
That's what the late night voicemails were?

36:38.120 --> 36:39.280
Ivy begging Jenny?

36:39.320 --> 36:40.680
Yeah.

36:40.720 --> 36:43.160
It was Ivy's idea to delete them.

36:43.200 --> 36:46.040
<i>So, I did, after I called</i> <i>for an ambulance.</i>

36:46.080 --> 36:48.640
<i>She knew her secret would</i> <i>get out if the police got</i>

36:46.080 --> 36:48.640
<i>hold of the phone.</i>

36:48.680 --> 36:51.560
It's fine. I did it.

36:51.600 --> 36:54.400
What we did had nothing to do with the murder.

36:54.440 --> 36:56.800
Yes, perhaps. Perhaps not.

36:56.840 --> 36:59.840
But why risk a criminal charge by deleting the voicemails?

37:00.920 --> 37:03.480
I'm no saint, but I'm not heartless.

37:03.520 --> 37:05.360
Ivy was in a state about her husband finding out.

37:05.400 --> 37:07.680
I felt for her. But that's all.

37:10.520 --> 37:13.160
Look, can we please just not talk about it?

37:10.520 --> 37:13.160
I can't bear it.

37:13.200 --> 37:16.320
I'm afraid you cheating on your husband is relevant

37:13.200 --> 37:16.320
to our investigation.

37:16.360 --> 37:19.840
What I did, that's not me. I love my husband.

37:19.880 --> 37:23.000
Oh, God! If he ever found out, if my kids found out...

37:23.040 --> 37:25.080
Jenny knowing your secret is a motive.

37:25.120 --> 37:27.960
Having Frank destroy the evidence doesn't

37:25.120 --> 37:27.960
help your case.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.640
It was a terrible, one-off mistake I made,

37:30.680 --> 37:34.520
after being drunk for the first time in six years.

37:34.560 --> 37:38.200
I'm sorry, but I... I couldn't let it tear my family apart.

37:38.240 --> 37:39.640
HUMPHREY: By deleting the voicemails?

37:39.680 --> 37:41.440
Or by killing Jenny?

37:41.480 --> 37:42.840
I'm not a killer.

37:42.880 --> 37:44.440
I imagine that, for the rest of your life,

37:44.480 --> 37:46.480
waiting for your sister-in-law to blow your family apart

37:46.520 --> 37:49.720
-must be torture. -Don't say that.

37:49.760 --> 37:52.640
Good Lord! What must Jenny have thought of me?

37:52.680 --> 37:55.360
Jenny didn't actually agree to keep quiet, did she?

37:55.400 --> 37:57.680
Well, she needed time to think.

37:57.720 --> 37:59.720
So, yes, I panicked.

37:59.760 --> 38:02.880
And I left her a couple of late-night begging messages,

38:02.920 --> 38:04.400
and when she died, I knew you'd find them.

38:06.440 --> 38:08.840
You can't let my mistake with Frank come out.

38:08.880 --> 38:10.880
Look, I know I... I don't deserve any kindness.

38:10.920 --> 38:13.840
But, please, I love my family.

38:13.880 --> 38:16.120
You're a suspect in a murder investigation.

38:16.160 --> 38:18.280
I'm afraid we can't promise anything.

38:18.320 --> 38:20.720
I'm not scared of being a murder suspect.

38:20.760 --> 38:24.720
But I am very scared of those voice messages.

38:24.760 --> 38:27.000
What does that say about my guilt?

38:29.560 --> 38:32.040
SAL: <i> What are you most</i> <i>likely to row about?</i>

38:32.080 --> 38:35.000
<i>Oh, that's easy, Sal.</i> <i>Jenny's backseat driving.</i>

38:36.640 --> 38:38.600
Found anything on the DVD yet, Chief?

38:38.640 --> 38:42.440
Uh, nothing, no, except for the fact that Simon

38:38.640 --> 38:42.440
clearly loves his fiancee.

38:42.480 --> 38:43.560
DWAYNE: Hmm.

38:44.480 --> 38:46.880
God, that is terrible.

38:46.920 --> 38:48.000
What is?

38:48.040 --> 38:50.360
I ran a record check on everyone

38:50.400 --> 38:51.520
and it threw this up.

38:52.560 --> 38:53.840
That Betty's sister?

38:53.880 --> 38:56.480
Carol Foss. She came home from her gap year

38:56.520 --> 38:59.040
and she was killed in a road traffic accident.

38:59.080 --> 39:00.520
But look when it was.

39:00.560 --> 39:02.440
That was the same month that Betty broke up with

39:00.560 --> 39:02.440
Simon Parke.

39:02.480 --> 39:05.160
Yes. That's what he meant by, "It was a bloody awful time."

39:05.200 --> 39:08.320
And he also said it was the victim who helped

39:05.200 --> 39:08.320
Betty get through it.

39:08.360 --> 39:10.000
Which explains their bond.

39:10.040 --> 39:12.200
CAMILLE: And makes it less likely she'd be our killer.

39:12.240 --> 39:13.680
HUMPHREY: There's no clear motives.

39:28.480 --> 39:30.480
So, what do you think?

39:30.520 --> 39:31.960
Uh, well...

39:33.040 --> 39:34.720
Come on. Come on.

39:35.800 --> 39:36.960
All right.

39:38.120 --> 39:39.360
Motives.

39:39.400 --> 39:41.800
Sal Tyler has been lying to us from the start.

39:41.840 --> 39:44.160
She received a large sum of cash from the deceased

39:44.200 --> 39:45.760
the day before she died

39:45.800 --> 39:48.640
-and we only have her word as to why.

39:45.800 --> 39:48.640
-Hmm.

39:48.680 --> 39:50.960
-CAMILLE: Mmm-hmm.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.960
Maybe she just wanted him back.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.840
As for Ivy,

39:54.880 --> 39:57.040
I think she could commit murder to keep her affair

39:54.880 --> 39:57.040
with Frank secret.

39:57.080 --> 39:58.520
Yes, but whatever their motives,

39:58.560 --> 40:01.200
how did any of them get out of their rooms to do it?

40:01.240 --> 40:03.880
See, the crime was committed between midnight

40:01.240 --> 40:03.880
and 1:00 a.m.,

40:03.920 --> 40:06.320
and all were seen entering their rooms at 10:00 p.m.

40:06.360 --> 40:09.800
and not emerging until 7:00 a.m. the

40:06.360 --> 40:09.800
following morning.

40:09.840 --> 40:12.000
-One of the hens

40:09.840 --> 40:12.000
must have done it.

40:14.960 --> 40:16.520
-FLORENCE: Mmm, that's strange.

40:17.600 --> 40:19.720
It's the labs on Guadeloupe.

40:19.760 --> 40:21.760
They've got back to us about the crystals we found

40:21.800 --> 40:23.400
on the side of the victim's bath,

40:23.440 --> 40:27.200
and they're saying here it's just table salt.

40:29.480 --> 40:32.080
You know, like you put on your food.

40:32.120 --> 40:35.160
Why would you sprinkle salt around your bath?

40:35.200 --> 40:37.160
Maybe it's some sort of hippie remedy.

40:37.200 --> 40:40.840
But if the salt belonged to her, we'd have found

40:37.200 --> 40:40.840
a salt cellar at the scene.

40:40.880 --> 40:44.760
Who takes salt to a murder and then sprinkles it

40:40.880 --> 40:44.760
around a bath?

40:44.800 --> 40:47.680
But then why did Jenny open the door to her killer,

40:44.800 --> 40:47.680
and, while we're at it,

40:47.720 --> 40:51.160
why did an otherwise well-cleaned room

40:47.720 --> 40:51.160
contain a cork?

40:51.200 --> 40:53.560
Yes, Chief, you're cooking now.

40:53.600 --> 40:55.240
Buckle up, everybody.

40:58.840 --> 41:00.280
Go on, then.

41:01.800 --> 41:03.160
Sorry, there's something I've got to do.

41:07.400 --> 41:08.520
Where him gone?

41:15.320 --> 41:17.520
-Humphrey! -Uh, yes, hello, Catherine.

41:19.480 --> 41:22.040
Well, yes, that is a good question.

41:19.480 --> 41:22.040
I'm not entirely sure.

41:22.080 --> 41:24.560
Um, can I, er...

41:24.600 --> 41:27.080
-Of course.

41:27.120 --> 41:30.800
Good, um, and I need you to be

41:27.120 --> 41:30.800
entirely honest with me.

41:33.720 --> 41:34.880
What is it?

41:38.360 --> 41:40.440
Do you think Camille would be happier

41:40.480 --> 41:44.160
staying here or accepting the job in Paris?

41:44.200 --> 41:46.240
Camille is ambitious, adventurous.

41:46.280 --> 41:48.080
She always has been.

41:48.120 --> 41:52.200
Of course she wants to go to Paris and work undercover,

41:52.240 --> 41:55.520
and although I'd rather she stayed here on the island,

41:52.240 --> 41:55.520
safe from harm,

41:57.200 --> 41:59.800
I know it would be best for her to leave.

42:01.320 --> 42:03.440
And you must know that.

42:03.480 --> 42:04.840
Yes, I do.

42:05.640 --> 42:06.760
Wait.

42:07.600 --> 42:09.720
I thought the job had gone.

42:09.760 --> 42:12.160
Ah. Well.  Yeah. Well, it has.

42:12.200 --> 42:13.760
It's just that, um...

42:13.800 --> 42:15.320
Oh, this table.

42:17.320 --> 42:18.640
Well, it just...

42:22.960 --> 42:24.080
I may have...

42:25.640 --> 42:26.880
Hold on.

42:29.640 --> 42:30.800
Good grief!

42:31.560 --> 42:32.600
<i>Merci.</i>

42:32.640 --> 42:34.040
Humphrey!

42:35.920 --> 42:37.040
Humphrey!

42:48.080 --> 42:50.160
Well, no. At least, not yet.

42:50.200 --> 42:52.360
But I think I know why we found a cork in her room.

42:52.400 --> 42:54.040
-Oh. -Well, at least Florence

42:52.400 --> 42:54.040
has worked out

42:54.080 --> 42:55.440
-why there was salt on the bath.

42:54.080 --> 42:55.440
-Mmm-hmm.

42:55.480 --> 42:56.720
Have a look at this.

42:59.760 --> 43:00.960
Good grief!

43:02.080 --> 43:03.840
We stayed up for a couple of drinks.

43:03.880 --> 43:05.360
HUMPHREY: <i> She opened the door</i> <i>to her killer...</i>

43:05.400 --> 43:07.320
<i>Uh, it was Halloween.</i>

43:07.360 --> 43:09.320
She was killed in a road-traffic accident.

43:09.360 --> 43:12.480
So, what does that mean?

43:12.520 --> 43:14.840
The game they played, uh, the questions

43:12.520 --> 43:14.840
and answers.

43:16.040 --> 43:17.480
Yes.

43:18.440 --> 43:19.560
The other statements?

43:26.040 --> 43:27.280
And the sister thing.

43:27.320 --> 43:28.600
Ah, yes, sir.

43:32.920 --> 43:34.520
That's it.

43:34.560 --> 43:37.520
God, it's awful. But it fits.

43:38.840 --> 43:41.560
Well, come on. You know what to do.

43:43.000 --> 43:44.680
Water.

43:52.200 --> 43:53.840
All right. Yeah.

43:57.240 --> 44:00.440
Thank you, all, for joining us.

44:00.480 --> 44:05.160
You see, when I open the door onto a crime scene...

44:05.200 --> 44:08.560
I ask, "What is the character of this murder?"

44:08.600 --> 44:11.040
And the character of Jenny's murder,

44:12.640 --> 44:13.880
was personal.

44:15.640 --> 44:16.840
I didn't do it.

44:19.000 --> 44:20.800
You're out of your mind if you think I did it.

44:21.600 --> 44:24.920
I know. I know.

44:24.960 --> 44:27.200
I always said the killer was one of her bridesmaids.

44:28.600 --> 44:31.120
You said Jenny was murdered between 12:00 and 1:00.

44:31.160 --> 44:32.880
We were all in our bedrooms then.

44:32.920 --> 44:35.680
You were. CCTV proves it.

44:37.000 --> 44:38.960
Between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.

44:37.000 --> 44:38.960
the next morning,

44:39.000 --> 44:41.240
you were all safely tucked up in your beds.

44:41.280 --> 44:43.120
Then it can't be one of us.

44:43.160 --> 44:44.840
That is unless...

44:46.280 --> 44:48.600
Unless the murder was actually committed

44:48.640 --> 44:50.520
much earlier in the evening

44:50.560 --> 44:53.280
and it was just made to look like it happened

44:50.560 --> 44:53.280
after midnight.

44:53.320 --> 44:56.120
I mean, that would be quite a clever trick, wouldn't it?

44:57.040 --> 44:58.160
Wouldn't it, Betty?

45:00.760 --> 45:02.720
Sorry?

45:02.760 --> 45:05.920
'Cause it was you who murdered Jenny, wasn't it?

45:05.960 --> 45:08.200
That's ridiculous. You can't just assume...

45:08.240 --> 45:10.280
From the start of the case, we worked on the basis

45:10.320 --> 45:12.840
that the murder happened after midnight,

45:12.880 --> 45:15.320
because the eight-hour candles in Jenny's bathroom

45:15.360 --> 45:19.040
flickered out at approximately 8:00 a.m. the morning her body

45:15.360 --> 45:19.040
was discovered.

45:19.880 --> 45:22.200
Little did we know you'd, uh,

45:22.240 --> 45:25.080
misdirected us with a sleight of hand.

45:27.240 --> 45:28.440
Isn't that right?

45:28.480 --> 45:31.520
We found salt crystals on the side of the bath,

45:31.560 --> 45:32.880
and, after a little digging,

45:32.920 --> 45:36.520
I discovered that if you add salt to a candle,

45:36.560 --> 45:38.960
it makes it burn down much more slowly.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.480
Thus extending the candle's life by, in this instance,

45:41.520 --> 45:43.080
over two hours.

45:44.400 --> 45:45.880
HUMPHREY: <i>After drowning Jenny,</i>

45:45.920 --> 45:47.480
<i>you poured salt onto</i> <i>the candles.</i>

45:47.520 --> 45:50.040
<i>You spilt some on the side</i> <i>of the bath,</i>

45:50.080 --> 45:53.160
allowing you to murder Jenny before you'd even gone to bed.

45:55.640 --> 45:57.880
But the three of us were all together before then.

45:57.920 --> 45:59.040
The entire time?

46:01.040 --> 46:04.640
HUMPHREY: <i> No loo breaks,</i> <i>no phone calls</i>

46:01.040 --> 46:04.640
<i>in a quiet spot?</i>

46:04.680 --> 46:08.040
Of course, but we're talking a couple of minutes at most.

46:08.080 --> 46:10.920
That's all she needed before her absence would

46:08.080 --> 46:10.920
be conspicuous.

46:11.920 --> 46:13.600
See, she didn't have time to, uh,

46:13.640 --> 46:16.400
wait at Jenny's front door for Jenny to get

46:13.640 --> 46:16.400
into the bath.

46:16.440 --> 46:18.160
She needed to be in and out in a flash.

46:18.200 --> 46:20.480
-But none of them had a key. -She didn't need one.

46:20.520 --> 46:22.880
She'd already ensured the door wasn't locked.

46:24.480 --> 46:27.200
Because Betty had been in Jenny's room that day.

46:27.240 --> 46:30.520
I was literally there for two seconds, no more.

46:30.560 --> 46:33.240
She didn't go to the suite just to collect Jenny

46:30.560 --> 46:33.240
that morning.

46:33.280 --> 46:35.920
She went because she'd already decided to murder her friend

46:35.960 --> 46:38.200
and she needed to prepare the ground.

46:38.240 --> 46:40.240
You see, we found this,

46:41.440 --> 46:42.760
on the floor of Jenny's suite.

46:42.800 --> 46:44.680
It was hidden under the chair, if you're interested.

46:45.920 --> 46:47.960
And I don't mind telling you that it's, uh,

46:48.000 --> 46:49.720
it's been bugging me ever since.

46:50.920 --> 46:52.760
Until I realised

46:52.800 --> 46:56.360
<i>that just as there's a trick</i> <i>to stopping a table from</i>

46:52.800 --> 46:56.360
<i>wobbling,</i>

46:56.400 --> 46:59.720
<i>there's also a trick to</i> <i>stopping a lock from working.</i>

46:59.760 --> 47:02.920
<i>It's an old burglar's trick,</i> <i>in actual fact,</i>

47:02.960 --> 47:05.640
<i>something I dare say you came</i> <i>across in your job as</i>

47:02.960 --> 47:05.640
<i>a loss adjuster</i>

47:05.680 --> 47:07.160
<i>for an insurance company.</i>

47:09.160 --> 47:12.040
The door was never locked from that point,

47:12.080 --> 47:15.320
meaning Betty could enter Jenny's room whenever

47:12.080 --> 47:15.320
she wished.

47:15.360 --> 47:18.400
<i>All Betty had to do was wait</i> <i>for a sign that Jenny had</i>

47:15.360 --> 47:18.400
<i>started her bath.</i>

47:20.800 --> 47:23.080
SAL: Another one, ladies? IVY: No!

47:23.120 --> 47:25.720
HUMPHREY: <i> At which point,</i> <i>she just had to buy herself</i>

47:23.120 --> 47:25.720
<i>a few minutes.</i> <i>I'm just going to nip to</i>

47:25.760 --> 47:28.360
<i>the loo. Back in a sec.</i>

47:28.400 --> 47:30.520
<i>You needed to be quick.</i>

47:30.560 --> 47:32.240
<i>But all you had to do</i> <i>was open the door.</i>

47:58.080 --> 48:01.200
<i>And that is when</i> <i>you made your one mistake,</i>

48:01.240 --> 48:04.400
<i>because in your rush</i> <i>to get away,</i>

48:01.240 --> 48:04.400
<i>you prised the cork out,</i>

48:04.440 --> 48:07.040
<i>but in your panic you didn't</i> <i>quite see where it went.</i>

48:07.080 --> 48:08.880
<i>Maybe you looked</i> <i>for a few seconds,</i>

48:08.920 --> 48:11.520
<i>but you couldn't delay</i> <i>any longer and, after all,</i>

48:11.560 --> 48:14.200
<i>it was only a cork.</i>

48:14.240 --> 48:16.680
<i>I mean, how incriminating</i> <i>could that be?</i>

48:16.720 --> 48:19.960
<i>But all this allowed</i> <i>you to return to your friends,</i>

48:20.000 --> 48:24.080
<i>without them even realising</i> <i>that Jenny was already dead.</i>

48:24.120 --> 48:27.480
You knew that when we found the eight-hour candles

48:24.120 --> 48:27.480
still working,

48:28.320 --> 48:29.880
well, we would presume that

48:29.920 --> 48:32.560
the murder couldn't have happened more than eight

48:29.920 --> 48:32.560
hours before,

48:32.600 --> 48:34.760
giving you the perfect alibi.

48:34.800 --> 48:37.600
You could prove that you were in your own room

48:37.640 --> 48:39.080
after midnight.

48:40.000 --> 48:41.080
But why?

48:42.320 --> 48:44.320
Exactly.

48:44.360 --> 48:47.880
Betty had handled you going out with Jenny for years,

48:44.360 --> 48:47.880
so why now?

48:47.920 --> 48:49.640
Because of something you said.

48:49.680 --> 48:51.480
Me?

48:51.520 --> 48:52.760
Well, I wasn't even on the island.

48:52.800 --> 48:54.240
HUMPHREY: Not in the flesh.

48:54.280 --> 48:56.400
But in the recording for the hen quiz...

48:56.440 --> 48:58.440
<i>Uh, it was Halloween.</i>

48:58.480 --> 49:00.360
<i>Jenny kept plying me</i> <i>with wine all night</i>

49:00.400 --> 49:02.320
<i>and then launched</i> <i>herself at me.</i>

49:02.360 --> 49:05.240
HUMPHREY: <i> You let slip that</i> <i>you and Jenny got together</i>

49:02.360 --> 49:05.240
<i>at Halloween.</i>

49:05.280 --> 49:07.680
Which was two months before you and Betty split up.

49:09.040 --> 49:12.200
Well, it was so long ago, I... I forgot.

49:12.240 --> 49:14.520
HUMPHREY: Well, I'm sorry, Simon,

49:14.560 --> 49:16.800
because that was the moment Betty realised.

49:18.400 --> 49:19.760
All those years,

49:19.800 --> 49:21.320
she'd sacrificed her feelings for you,

49:21.360 --> 49:23.520
because she believed that her friend Jenny

49:23.560 --> 49:25.240
had been honest with her.

49:25.280 --> 49:28.360
And not just any friend. Her best friend.

49:28.400 --> 49:30.920
So, when she heard that honesty never existed,

49:30.960 --> 49:34.160
that you'd been cheating on her with her best friend

49:30.960 --> 49:34.160
for months...

49:34.200 --> 49:37.480
HUMPHREY: You know, I think that Betty also realised

49:34.200 --> 49:37.480
at that very moment

49:37.520 --> 49:40.880
that had her best friend been honest with her,

49:37.520 --> 49:40.880
told her the truth...

49:42.280 --> 49:44.120
then her sister Carol would still be alive.

49:45.520 --> 49:48.800
See, when you really got together at Halloween,

49:48.840 --> 49:51.960
Carol Foss was travelling the world.

49:52.000 --> 49:55.880
If you'd told Betty the truth when you should have done,

49:55.920 --> 49:59.720
she wouldn't have even been in the country to try

49:55.920 --> 49:59.720
and comfort her sister.

49:59.760 --> 50:02.760
But instead, when she heard what happened,

50:02.800 --> 50:05.880
she jumped in her car to travel from Cornwall

50:08.160 --> 50:10.800
In Betty's mind, your duplicity

50:10.840 --> 50:12.640
was responsible for the death of Carol Foss.

50:12.680 --> 50:14.920
That's something you have to live with.

50:14.960 --> 50:17.520
But in her fury...

50:17.560 --> 50:21.320
Betty didn't even give her friend a chance to do that.

50:21.360 --> 50:23.480
<i>She'd just discovered that</i> <i>her best friend betrayed her,</i>

50:23.520 --> 50:25.480
<i>with the most horrific</i> <i>consequences.</i>

50:27.920 --> 50:30.800
That's why Jenny called you straight afterwards.

50:30.840 --> 50:32.960
See, I think she sensed that Betty had worked out

50:33.000 --> 50:35.040
that you'd both gone behind her back.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.040
Is that right, Betty?

50:38.560 --> 50:42.120
Ten years she's been laughing at me.

50:42.880 --> 50:44.200
You both have!

50:45.640 --> 50:48.880
You murdered my sister! You murdered...

51:00.960 --> 51:04.160
What a day! So, have you got any plans for this evening?

51:05.000 --> 51:06.880
I'm meeting Gloria at 7:00.

51:06.920 --> 51:10.560
Well, I shall look forward to hearing all about it

51:06.920 --> 51:10.560
tomorrow evening.

51:10.600 --> 51:12.920
Hmm

51:12.960 --> 51:14.920
Gloria is an old friend of mine.

51:14.960 --> 51:17.600
I'm meeting her for a drink tomorrow evening,

51:17.640 --> 51:20.680
and I'm sure she'll tell me all about her special

51:17.640 --> 51:20.680
night out with

51:20.720 --> 51:21.840
Officer Dwayne Myers.

51:33.840 --> 51:35.240
-Hey. -Hey.

51:37.480 --> 51:38.640
Can we talk?

51:39.680 --> 51:40.880
Of course.

51:49.000 --> 51:50.080
What's going on?

51:51.920 --> 51:53.800
I think it's time I was honest with you,

51:53.840 --> 51:56.280
at least, as honest as I can be, which

51:56.320 --> 51:59.400
may well not be very honest at all in the grand

51:56.320 --> 51:59.400
scheme of things.

51:59.440 --> 52:03.800
Uh, but I'd never forgive myself if I didn't do

51:59.440 --> 52:03.800
what was right.

52:03.840 --> 52:07.520
Okay, you know, sometimes, as much as I think

52:03.840 --> 52:07.520
I understand English,

52:07.560 --> 52:09.080
I... I'm not sure I do.

52:10.120 --> 52:11.280
Your job in Paris.

52:11.800 --> 52:13.920
Yes?

52:13.960 --> 52:16.520
It was me that got them to withdraw their offer.

52:18.040 --> 52:19.160
What?

52:19.200 --> 52:21.040
They needed me to agree to release you.

52:26.760 --> 52:28.640
I didn't want to lose you.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.440
But I... I knew deep in my heart you wanted to go.

52:35.400 --> 52:38.160
When you first told me about it,

52:35.400 --> 52:38.160
I saw it in your eyes.

52:38.840 --> 52:40.520
You were excited.

52:41.880 --> 52:43.520
And you still stopped me going?

52:44.880 --> 52:45.920
Yes.

53:01.760 --> 53:03.840
I'm sorry. I've behaved selfishly.

53:06.880 --> 53:08.840
You see, you've become very important to me, Camille,

53:08.880 --> 53:10.280
much more than you'd ever know.

53:12.400 --> 53:14.800
But if you care about someone, you have to let them

53:12.400 --> 53:14.800
be the person

53:14.840 --> 53:16.520
they are, not the person you want them to be,

53:16.560 --> 53:18.000
otherwise what's the point?

53:20.360 --> 53:22.120
So, I called the Commissioner.

53:22.720 --> 53:24.880
He called Paris,

53:24.920 --> 53:27.560
and, well, the point is,

53:27.600 --> 53:29.120
you're flying from Guadeloupe in the morning.

53:31.080 --> 53:33.000
The ferry leaves first thing.

53:34.120 --> 53:36.080
You see, my father always told me that

53:36.120 --> 53:40.000
you can't help making a mistake, but if you try

53:36.120 --> 53:40.000
and make it right,

53:40.040 --> 53:42.200
people will forgive your stupidity.

53:42.240 --> 53:44.400
I could kill you.

53:44.440 --> 53:46.440
Yes, well, if it helps, I could throw myself

53:44.440 --> 53:46.440
in the sea.

53:46.480 --> 53:48.120
Don't tempt me.

53:51.840 --> 53:53.480
<i>Maman</i> and...

53:54.440 --> 53:55.840
the team.

53:56.720 --> 53:57.840
You.

54:00.040 --> 54:01.600
Don't worry. I'll muddle through.

54:07.080 --> 54:08.240
You're wet. Yes, I am.

54:12.400 --> 54:13.840
It will dry.

54:15.280 --> 54:16.480
You'd better pack.

54:25.480 --> 54:26.560
Thank you.

54:27.800 --> 54:28.960
<i>Maman!</i>

54:30.120 --> 54:31.880
<i>Je vais a Paris.</i>

54:31.920 --> 54:33.320
<i>Je vais a Paris.</i>

54:52.600 --> 54:54.720
Don't you go leaving me too, old pal.

55:05.240 --> 55:06.800
I'm so proud of you.

55:07.960 --> 55:09.800
I'll ring you every week.

55:09.840 --> 55:10.960
Of course you will.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.280
-Now go.

55:14.200 --> 55:15.400
Have your adventure.

55:21.760 --> 55:24.720
Well? I didn't get up early on a Saturday

55:21.760 --> 55:24.720
for nothing, you know.

55:25.760 --> 55:27.080
Come now.

55:29.440 --> 55:31.960
Oh, I'm really going to miss you.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.800
Those Parisians are lucky to have you.

55:34.840 --> 55:37.160
Let me know if you need a visitor.

55:37.200 --> 55:40.640
I'll show them how to party island-style. Personally.

55:44.360 --> 55:47.480
Oh, and you are going to do just great.

55:47.520 --> 55:49.400
-Oh, yeah.

55:49.440 --> 55:51.600
Promise me one thing, though.

55:51.640 --> 55:53.520
-Look after Humphrey. -Of course.

55:57.640 --> 56:00.400
I knew we couldn't keep you for ever.

56:00.440 --> 56:04.320
But you will always have a place here,

56:00.440 --> 56:04.320
whenever you want it.

56:07.200 --> 56:08.360
Do us proud.

56:11.200 --> 56:12.680
I'll try.

56:14.880 --> 56:16.000
You'd better go in, huh?

56:16.040 --> 56:18.080
Yeah, but... I'll get him to call you.

56:21.640 --> 56:23.000
Yes, okay.

56:24.680 --> 56:25.880
Well...

56:27.720 --> 56:29.520
Goodbye, everyone.

56:43.400 --> 56:45.200
Camille! Wait!

56:45.960 --> 56:47.360
Wait, wait!

56:49.800 --> 56:52.200
-Oh! -I'm sorry I'm late.

56:52.240 --> 56:54.120
-It's all right. -I had to get you

56:52.240 --> 56:54.120
a leaving present.

56:55.440 --> 56:56.640
What is it?

56:57.160 --> 56:58.520
You'll see.

57:00.160 --> 57:02.480
-I'm going to miss you. -And me, you.

57:07.560 --> 57:09.720
-Hey! -Oh, oh, oh! Oh, oh, oh!

57:49.840 --> 57:51.200
CATHERINE: You did the right thing.

57:51.840 --> 57:53.560
Letting her go.

57:55.360 --> 57:56.760
Oh, I know.

57:58.880 --> 58:00.400
I know.

58:09.480 --> 58:12.200
DWAYNE: <i> A band from the UK</i> <i>are here to record an album.</i>

58:12.240 --> 58:13.960
Flowers Of Progress are here on Saint Marie?

58:14.000 --> 58:16.160
Good afternoon, sir. You must be JP.

58:16.200 --> 58:17.800
Oh, yes, of course. You've not met.

58:17.840 --> 58:20.560
I can't believe I'll be working with the

58:17.840 --> 58:20.560
legendary Dwayne Myers.

58:20.600 --> 58:22.840
I'm very dedicated to my undercover work, you know.

58:22.880 --> 58:25.960
There's members of this band who've got a real axe to grind

58:22.880 --> 58:25.960
with my brother.
