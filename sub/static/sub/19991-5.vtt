cooked this patty?

SpongeBob Squarepants!

01:30.656 --> 01:32.756
- Did somebody
call my name?

01:32.758 --> 01:35.792
- Is there a problem
with your sandwich, sir?

01:35.794 --> 01:36.460
- Yes!

01:36.462 --> 01:38.562
I feel like I could die...

01:39.465 --> 01:41.198
And go to heaven.

01:43.502 --> 01:44.401
- Oh, please, sir.

01:44.403 --> 01:45.335
Don't.
Stop.

01:45.337 --> 01:46.770
You really can stop, sir.

01:46.772 --> 01:49.673
Everyone seems to really
like the Krabby Patty.

01:49.675 --> 01:51.775
- Some people
started calling it

01:51.777 --> 01:54.344
the "SpongeBob Patty."

01:54.346 --> 01:55.946
- What?
That's ridiculous.

01:55.948 --> 01:58.782
It's always been
The Krabby Patty.

01:59.217 --> 02:00.951
- One SpongeBob Patty,
please.

02:00.953 --> 02:01.585
- Huh?

02:01.587 --> 02:03.653
- Maybe you should
change the name of this place

02:03.655 --> 02:07.624
from the Krusty Krab
to SpongeBob's Place.

02:07.626 --> 02:09.658
Ha, ha, ha!

02:09.661 --> 02:12.863

02:38.123 --> 02:40.991
Without SpongeBob,
you'd be nothing.

02:40.993 --> 02:41.958
- Well, that's not true.

If you think
the Krusty Krab is haunted

02:58.577 --> 02:59.442
and needs ghostbusting,

02:59.444 --> 03:01.978
I'll stay away
for a while.

03:02.980 --> 03:04.381
- Haunted, eh?

03:04.383 --> 03:06.316

Ouch.

03:28.440 --> 03:29.573
What do we do now, Gary?

03:29.575 --> 03:33.310
We've read every book
and played every game.

03:33.312 --> 03:33.977
Hey, I know!

03:33.979 --> 03:36.413
How about another makeover?

03:37.449 --> 03:40.817
- You know, I can't go
to the Krusty Krab.

03:40.819 --> 03:43.320
But I can play Krusty Krab!

03:44.590 --> 03:47.324
- Oh!
This can be the register boat.

03:47.326 --> 03:49.459
And you can be Squidward.

30 Krabby Patties?

04:00.973 --> 04:02.739
Coming right up!

04:03.975 --> 04:04.908
- Meow meow.

04:26.665 --> 04:29.599
Okay, everybody, order up!

04:31.369 --> 04:31.868
Hmm.

04:31.870 --> 04:34.104
Guess I'm used to cooking
Krabby Patties

04:34.106 --> 04:35.972
in mass quantities.

04:45.484 --> 04:46.082
- Ooh!

04:46.084 --> 04:48.351
Ooh!

04:50.022 --> 04:51.054
How's about making some more

04:51.056 --> 04:53.023
of those delicious patties?

04:53.025 --> 04:54.658
- I drew two more mouths
on my face

04:54.660 --> 04:56.559
so I could eat
three at a time.

04:58.363 --> 04:59.062
- Okay, you guys.

04:59.064 --> 05:00.697
Just make yourself
comfortable.

05:00.699 --> 05:02.799
More patties on the way!

05:07.739 --> 05:08.672
- Whoa!

05:08.674 --> 05:10.540
- These are being sent back.

05:14.246 --> 05:15.645
What?
What's wrong with them?

05:15.647 --> 05:17.947
- Customers said
to make them good...

05:17.949 --> 05:19.482
like they used to be.

05:19.484 --> 05:20.784
- Like they <i> used</i> to be?

05:20.786 --> 05:23.153
It's the same formula!

05:23.155 --> 05:24.654
- Hey!

05:25.690 --> 05:26.623
I see the problem!

05:26.625 --> 05:29.059
SpongeBob's not in the kitchen!

05:29.061 --> 05:29.793
Huh?

05:32.564 --> 05:33.863
- I don't think so.

05:33.865 --> 05:35.432
- I don't know why,
but it's bad.

05:35.434 --> 05:37.534
- Let me out of this place.

05:37.536 --> 05:38.802
Wait!
Wait!

05:38.804 --> 05:40.170
Please, don't go!

05:40.172 --> 05:42.739
We're having a two-for-one sale.

05:42.741 --> 05:44.607
For every two you buy,

05:44.609 --> 05:45.909
you can buy another one.

05:45.911 --> 05:48.411
Hold on, everybody!

05:48.413 --> 05:51.614
I think I hear SpongeBob's
hideous laughter

05:51.616 --> 05:53.850
coming from the kitchen!

05:54.185 --> 05:58.655
I'll show you that the customers
are always wrong.

05:58.657 --> 06:00.490
- Oh, boy.

06:00.492 --> 06:01.458
Huh?

06:01.460 --> 06:02.592
- Now, go ahead.

06:02.594 --> 06:04.094
Call attention to me.

06:04.096 --> 06:05.695
- Hey, everybody.

06:05.697 --> 06:08.865
Look who's back in the kitchen.

06:08.867 --> 06:10.800
- I'm ready!
I'm ready!

06:10.802 --> 06:13.002
- That's SpongeBob?

06:13.004 --> 06:15.705
Man, did he
let himself go!

06:15.707 --> 06:16.473
- Who cares?

06:16.475 --> 06:17.874
I'll take a Krabby Patty!

06:17.876 --> 06:19.709
- I'll order some too!

06:19.711 --> 06:20.844
- Make mine a triple!

06:20.846 --> 06:22.579
- Yeah!
- My appetite's back!

06:24.149 --> 06:25.448
- Mmm.

06:25.450 --> 06:26.015
- Yum.

06:26.017 --> 06:29.152
- Is everybody enjoying
their Krabby Patties?

06:32.457 --> 06:35.892
Yes, it's very nice.

06:37.229 --> 06:40.563
It was me that cooked
those patties!

06:40.565 --> 06:43.933
You're all enjoying
my food!

06:45.003 --> 06:47.137
- I thought
something was off.

06:49.508 --> 06:50.974
Oh, no, you don't!

07:00.852 --> 07:01.684
Ha!

07:01.686 --> 07:02.752
Anyone who
wants to leave

07:02.754 --> 07:05.755
has to go
through me first.

07:10.128 --> 07:11.628
Ahh!

07:11.630 --> 07:12.629
Ow!
Eee!

07:12.631 --> 07:13.630
Hey!
Oh!

07:13.632 --> 07:14.497
Whoa!
Ah!

07:14.499 --> 07:15.532
Blazes!
- G'night, boss!

07:15.534 --> 07:16.933
See you in the morning.
- Ow!

07:16.935 --> 07:18.768
Eee!
Hey!

07:21.606 --> 07:23.239
"SpongeBob's Place"?

07:23.241 --> 07:25.575
What in the ocean?

07:25.577 --> 07:26.543
Pardon me.

07:26.545 --> 07:27.510
Don't mind me!

07:27.512 --> 07:31.948
Just trying to
get in my own front door!

07:32.751 --> 07:34.184
<i>- You've reached</i>
<i>the Health Department.</i>

07:34.186 --> 07:37.086
<i>If you'd like to leave</i>
<i>a message, wait for the cough.</i>

07:37.889 --> 07:39.689

07:39.691 --> 07:40.957
This is Squidward Tentacles,

07:40.959 --> 07:42.759
and I'd like to
lodge a complaint

07:42.761 --> 07:45.261
about my neighbor SpongeBob.

07:46.765 --> 07:48.031
- That should do it, Mr. Krabs.

07:48.033 --> 07:50.900
You'll be good as new
in no time.

07:50.902 --> 07:52.535
- Wasting your time, boys.

07:52.537 --> 07:55.538
You should just take me
straight to the morgue.

07:55.540 --> 07:56.739
I'm done.

07:57.676 --> 07:59.542
Stop!
Stop here!

08:05.583 --> 08:06.850
- Ah!

08:10.287 --> 08:11.254
Make a hole!

08:21.332 --> 08:21.965
- Hey!

08:21.967 --> 08:22.899
- Oh, hello, Mr. Krabs.

08:22.901 --> 08:24.601
Place your order with Gary,
please.

08:24.603 --> 08:25.635
And drop your money anywhere.

08:25.637 --> 08:27.136
I'm running out of places
to put it.

08:27.138 --> 08:29.339
I don't even have time
to count it.

08:33.178 --> 08:34.777
- Here, try one.

08:35.881 --> 08:37.780
Oh, it's delicious.

08:37.782 --> 08:38.948
- Sorry,
I ran out of napkins.

08:38.950 --> 08:41.116
You'll have to use
a $100 bill.

08:41.119 --> 08:45.255
- You deserve your own place.

08:48.894 --> 08:50.693
- Mr. Krabs, don't go!

08:50.695 --> 08:51.294
I need you.

08:51.296 --> 08:53.763
- Ah,
what do you need me for?

08:53.765 --> 08:54.931
You got everything:

a magic touch for cooking,

08:56.701 --> 08:58.201
lots of customers,

08:58.203 --> 08:59.002
money.

08:59.004 --> 09:00.637
- I could use a boss.

09:00.639 --> 09:02.605
Someone to
take all the credit

09:02.607 --> 09:03.706
and all the money.

09:03.708 --> 09:04.407
- Huh?
Hmm.

09:04.409 --> 09:08.811
Well, I suppose
I could do some bossing.

How's 99% for me
and 1% for you?

09:11.683 --> 09:14.317

more than generous!

09:22.026 --> 09:26.162
Oh, no people are ever

11:07.932 --> 11:09.399
- Mr. Squidward!

11:10.502 --> 11:12.168
And...uh...

11:12.170 --> 11:14.837
oh...

11:20.344 --> 11:22.378
- You know, I've been doing
some thinking.

11:22.380 --> 11:24.414
You're a big part
of this place, boy-o,

11:24.416 --> 11:27.884
and I believe I should
share the name with you.

11:27.886 --> 11:28.584
Take a gander.

11:28.586 --> 11:30.386
- I don't get it, Mr. Krabs.

11:30.388 --> 11:31.354
It looks the same.

11:31.356 --> 11:32.989
- Well, climb up there!

11:32.991 --> 11:34.857
Get a closer look.

11:37.128 --> 11:37.894
Where?

11:37.896 --> 11:40.830
- Under the words "Krusty Krab."

11:40.832 --> 11:42.865
- "The Krusty Krab"...

11:43.401 --> 11:45.468
"And SpongeBob's Place."

11:45.470 --> 11:48.838
Oh, Mr. Krabs, you're the best!

11:48.840 --> 11:49.939
Whoo!

12:06.191 --> 12:08.858
- Oh, Planky-bear.

12:08.860 --> 12:10.460
Plankton.

12:12.430 --> 12:13.563
- Plankton!

12:13.565 --> 12:14.430
- What?

12:14.432 --> 12:15.264
What is it, Karen?

12:15.266 --> 12:17.233
Can't you see
I'm working here?

12:17.235 --> 12:19.235
- Yes, but I wanted to show you

12:19.237 --> 12:20.970
my new screen saver.

12:20.972 --> 12:22.371
What do you think?

12:22.373 --> 12:23.039
- Great.

12:23.041 --> 12:23.973
- You didn't even look.

12:23.975 --> 12:25.374
No, I didn't.

12:25.376 --> 12:27.310
Can't you see
I'm working on

12:27.312 --> 12:28.978
my new molecular analyzer?

12:28.980 --> 12:32.548
Now all I need is the
smallest molecule of a patty,

12:32.550 --> 12:34.584
and the formula
will be mine!

12:34.586 --> 12:35.585
- Just tell me if I should

12:35.587 --> 12:39.155
permanently upload
this screen saver!

12:39.157 --> 12:40.022
- I said not...

12:40.024 --> 12:43.092
Now-ow-ow!

12:44.329 --> 12:47.497
Ow!

13:00.945 --> 13:02.044
<i>- Analyzing.</i>

13:02.046 --> 13:03.579
<i>30% mean guy,</i>

13:03.581 --> 13:05.915
<i>20% spiteful monster,</i>

13:05.917 --> 13:08.151
<i>50% evil butthead.</i>

13:08.153 --> 13:09.452
<i>Sample is...</i>

13:09.454 --> 13:12.655
<i>100% big jerk.</i>

13:14.659 --> 13:15.658
<i>- I have also analyzed</i>

13:15.660 --> 13:17.393
<i>your screen saver,</i>
<i>Karen.</i>

13:17.395 --> 13:19.128
<i>It is most beautiful.</i>

13:19.130 --> 13:21.130
- No one asked you.

13:21.966 --> 13:23.933
Are you happy now, Karen?

13:23.935 --> 13:24.634
- No, I'm not.

13:24.636 --> 13:27.670
I was just trying to
make myself pretty for you,

13:27.672 --> 13:28.571
but do you even care?

13:28.573 --> 13:31.574
All you ever do
is make stupid schemes

13:31.576 --> 13:33.976
about stupid sandwiches!

13:33.978 --> 13:34.610
- Stupid?

13:34.612 --> 13:37.046
Your new screen saver
is stupid,

13:37.048 --> 13:40.349
and it makes your processor
look fat!

13:41.586 --> 13:43.519
- What?

13:43.521 --> 13:44.220
- Oop.

13:44.222 --> 13:45.621
Okay, let's all calm down

13:45.623 --> 13:48.291
before you say something
you'll regret.

13:48.293 --> 13:49.058
- You know what?

13:49.060 --> 13:51.127
No one talks to me
like that.

13:51.129 --> 13:51.694
Get out!

13:51.696 --> 13:53.129
- I will not get out.

13:53.131 --> 13:54.397
This is my restaurant,

13:54.399 --> 13:56.499
and no one can make me...

13:56.501 --> 13:57.633
leave!

13:57.635 --> 13:59.302
Ow!

13:59.304 --> 14:01.037
Karen, baby.

14:01.039 --> 14:01.838
Come on, sugar lips,

14:01.840 --> 14:04.207
you know I'm sorry
for everything I said.

14:05.543 --> 14:06.409
- I accept your apology.

14:06.411 --> 14:09.212
- I wasn't talking to you,
idiot!

14:11.516 --> 14:13.249
Pain!

14:13.684 --> 14:15.351
Okay, Karen, fun is fun,

14:15.353 --> 14:16.986
but it's time to let me back in.

14:16.988 --> 14:19.689
Come on, I really
need to use the potty!

14:21.092 --> 14:24.193
Fine, I don't need you
or the Chum Bucket!

14:24.195 --> 14:26.229
I got plenty of friends
around here

14:26.231 --> 14:28.598
who would love to take me in.

14:29.032 --> 14:31.367
So is it cool if I crash here?
- No.

14:31.369 --> 14:33.502
- Then can I just
use your bath room?

14:34.305 --> 14:36.005
- Plankton, I know
where this is going.

14:36.007 --> 14:39.041
I'd love it
if you'd stay with me!

14:39.043 --> 14:39.709
- Are you crazy?

14:39.711 --> 14:42.278
You're the most annoying sponge
in the sea.

14:42.280 --> 14:43.246
I wouldn't stay with you

14:43.248 --> 14:46.582
if you were the last person
in Bikini Bottom.

14:49.220 --> 14:50.186
- Suit yourself.

14:51.189 --> 14:53.089
- Okay, fine!

14:58.129 --> 14:59.228
Whew!

14:59.230 --> 15:00.096
Much better.

15:00.098 --> 15:01.397
Thanks for letting me
use your bathroom.

15:01.399 --> 15:03.799
Silly, that's not my bathroom.

15:03.801 --> 15:04.700
- Well, in that case,

15:04.702 --> 15:06.702
you're gonna need
some new shoes.

15:06.704 --> 15:07.403
- Oh, boy!

15:07.405 --> 15:10.206
Does this mean
you're gonna stay with me?

15:10.208 --> 15:11.474
- Yes!

15:11.476 --> 15:12.341
- Yeah!

15:13.745 --> 15:16.112
We're gonna be
the best roommates ever!

15:16.114 --> 15:18.281
Oh!
Wanna do each other's hair?

15:18.283 --> 15:21.117
- Oh, forget this!

15:25.322 --> 15:28.624
<i>- Oh, my love,</i>
<i>what a fool I've been.</i>

15:28.626 --> 15:32.161
<i>You've always been</i>
<i>the only one for me.</i>

15:38.202 --> 15:39.402
- Aw, Plankton.

15:39.404 --> 15:40.469
I am so sorry that

15:40.471 --> 15:42.271
Karen threw you out.

15:42.273 --> 15:43.572
- Threw me out?

15:43.574 --> 15:44.774
I threw her in!

15:44.776 --> 15:46.642
- Hey, this is
your safe place.

15:46.644 --> 15:50.112
It's okay to talk about
your feelings.

15:50.114 --> 15:51.547
Oh, somebody's tense!

15:51.549 --> 15:53.182
- Hey!
What?

15:53.184 --> 15:54.183
Get off!

15:54.185 --> 15:55.184
Get--Oh!

15:57.088 --> 15:58.187
Oh,
that's the spot.

15:58.189 --> 16:01.390
- Now, tell SpongeBob why
you and Karen got into a fight.

16:01.392 --> 16:03.559
- I don't know,
I was just doing

16:03.561 --> 16:05.394
the same things I always do.

16:05.396 --> 16:06.629
- Well, if Karen
threw you out

16:06.631 --> 16:08.497
for doing the same things
you always do,

16:08.499 --> 16:10.466
maybe you should learn
to not do

16:10.468 --> 16:12.234
the same things
you always do!

16:12.236 --> 16:13.269
- But I'm the best.

16:13.271 --> 16:15.538
- Well, sometimes
you can get a little...

16:15.540 --> 16:16.439
aggressive.

16:16.441 --> 16:18.274
- Me, aggressive?

16:18.276 --> 16:19.575
How dare you?

16:24.582 --> 16:25.681
Maybe you're right.

16:25.683 --> 16:28.284
I can be a big jerk
sometimes.

16:28.286 --> 16:33.222
I command you to help me
be a nicer person!

16:34.324 --> 16:35.725
I mean, will you please,

16:35.727 --> 16:38.227
please help me
be a nicer person

16:38.229 --> 16:40.763
so Karen
will take me back?

16:40.765 --> 16:44.333
- Plankton, in a word: yes!

16:45.869 --> 16:48.371
- What is that dimwit
doing here?

16:48.373 --> 16:50.339
- Ahh!
Oh, behind me!

16:50.341 --> 16:52.208
Oh, get away!

16:52.210 --> 16:53.509
- Will you stop that?

16:53.511 --> 16:55.177
There's no one behind you!

16:55.179 --> 16:57.380
You're the dimwit.

16:57.382 --> 16:59.782
- Oh.

16:59.784 --> 17:00.616
Thanks!

17:00.618 --> 17:01.584
- All right, Plankton,

17:01.586 --> 17:03.753
the first step
to becoming a nicer person

17:03.755 --> 17:05.186
is being thoughtful.

17:05.189 --> 17:06.454
Try holding a door
for someone.

17:06.457 --> 17:09.692
It's simple,
and it makes people happy.

17:09.694 --> 17:10.925
Like this.

17:10.928 --> 17:11.560
After you.

17:11.561 --> 17:14.797
I'm happy, SpongeBob!

17:17.468 --> 17:20.301
- Can someone
get me out of here?

17:20.304 --> 17:21.604
Whew!

17:21.606 --> 17:22.905
- All right, Plankton.
Now you try!

17:22.906 --> 17:26.308
- Fine, but if he kisses me,
I'm gonna lose it.

17:28.546 --> 17:31.881
- Ugh.
After you.

17:40.224 --> 17:41.524
Whoa!

17:43.226 --> 17:45.461
- Try this one.

17:45.463 --> 17:46.562
- After you.

17:46.564 --> 17:48.264
- But I can't fit through there.

17:48.266 --> 17:51.700
- How dare you
reject my act of kindness!

17:51.702 --> 17:52.601
Yah!
- Ahh!

17:55.406 --> 17:56.338
- Plankton, no!

17:56.340 --> 17:57.840
- Can someone
get me out of here?

18:01.478 --> 18:02.311
Okay, Plankton,

18:02.313 --> 18:04.413
since you don't seem to be able
to do something nice,

18:04.415 --> 18:06.315
in this lesson
you're going to learn

18:06.317 --> 18:07.983
to <i> say</i> something nice.

18:07.985 --> 18:09.318
- Easy!

18:09.320 --> 18:09.852
- Great.

18:09.854 --> 18:12.455
So turn to Patrick
and say something nice.

18:14.391 --> 18:16.692
- Say something nice.

18:16.694 --> 18:17.293
- Uh...

18:17.295 --> 18:21.797
Patrick,
you are not a total moron.

18:21.799 --> 18:23.232
Just half of one.

18:23.234 --> 18:24.533
- No, try again.

18:24.535 --> 18:25.067
- Fine.

18:25.069 --> 18:28.771
Your color pink
is not so repugnant.

18:28.773 --> 18:29.772
- Thanks!

18:29.774 --> 18:31.407
I like...um...

18:31.409 --> 18:32.475
your antennas.

18:32.477 --> 18:35.344
- What?
What's wrong with my antennas?

18:35.346 --> 18:37.713
- Plankton, Patrick was
complimenting you.

18:37.715 --> 18:38.614
- Yeah, right.

18:38.616 --> 18:40.616
You two are mocking me!

18:41.686 --> 18:42.818
- Hey, SpongeBob?

18:42.820 --> 18:44.954
Do you think
this is working?

18:44.956 --> 18:47.756
- No, I think we better
try something else.

18:52.295 --> 18:54.563
It's no use, SpongeBob.

18:54.565 --> 18:56.999
I'm just too brilliant
to be nice.

18:57.001 --> 18:59.368
I'll never get Karen back now.

18:59.370 --> 19:00.269
- Oh, yes, you will!

19:00.271 --> 19:03.472
We obviously can't fix
your terrible insides,

19:03.474 --> 19:04.740
but maybe, just maybe,

19:04.742 --> 19:08.277
we can work on
your terrible outsides.

19:08.279 --> 19:09.879
Makeover time!

19:22.827 --> 19:24.059
- Brother.

19:36.873 --> 19:38.841
Forget it, SpongeBob.

19:38.843 --> 19:40.910
Karen's the perfect woman:

19:40.912 --> 19:42.912
so smart, so conniving.

19:42.914 --> 19:46.415
Ah, she's never
gonna take me back.

19:46.417 --> 19:47.316
- Oh, yes, she is.

19:47.318 --> 19:49.518
You just need to
do something big.

19:49.520 --> 19:51.353
Be vulnerable, be sweet.

19:51.355 --> 19:52.821
Show Karen your heart.

19:52.823 --> 19:54.523
- That's a great idea!

19:54.525 --> 19:57.593
I'll cook up a scheme
to make her jealous

19:57.595 --> 19:59.428
and crush her spirit!

20:00.064 --> 20:02.798
- That wasn't even close
to what I said.

20:02.800 --> 20:03.566
- Sure it was.

20:03.568 --> 20:05.901
And I know
just how to do it.

20:07.038 --> 20:09.605
- Okay,
I feel uncomfortable.

20:09.906 --> 20:11.640
Plankton, are you sure
about this?

20:11.642 --> 20:13.108
- Of course I'm sure.

20:13.110 --> 20:15.344
Now, start doing
a robot voice.

20:15.346 --> 20:17.680
Remember, you're not
SpongeBob anymore;

20:17.682 --> 20:19.648
you're Shelby Naughtica.

20:19.650 --> 20:21.984
Oh, I like that!

20:21.986 --> 20:24.653
Boop beep!
Beep boop boop!

20:24.655 --> 20:26.889
- Welcome
to the Chum Bucket!

20:26.891 --> 20:27.723
Oh.

20:27.725 --> 20:28.958
It's you.

20:28.960 --> 20:29.959
What do you want?

20:29.961 --> 20:30.759
- Yes, hello.

20:30.761 --> 20:33.963
I would like your most
romantic table

20:33.965 --> 20:36.799
for myself
and my beautiful date,

20:36.801 --> 20:38.500
Shelby Naughtica,

20:38.502 --> 20:39.134
the robot.

20:39.136 --> 20:41.904
- Beep boop!

20:41.906 --> 20:43.539
- Hmm.

20:43.541 --> 20:45.641
Hmm.

20:45.643 --> 20:47.042
Mm-hmm.

20:47.044 --> 20:48.644
Shelby Naughtica, huh?

20:48.646 --> 20:51.880
Oh, what
a beautiful name.

20:51.882 --> 20:52.781
- Thank you!

20:52.783 --> 20:53.782
- Ow!

20:53.784 --> 20:55.818
I mean, thank you.

20:55.820 --> 20:57.987
Whoa!
Beep boop beep bo boop!

20:57.989 --> 21:02.825
- I'll be right back
with our lovers' special.

21:03.561 --> 21:05.861
This is going so great,
SpongeBob!

21:05.863 --> 21:07.963
Karen is totally jealous.

21:07.965 --> 21:08.764
- Here we go.

21:08.766 --> 21:11.834
I whipped up a special batch
of chum for you,

21:11.836 --> 21:13.702
and for your lovely robot date,

21:13.704 --> 21:17.573
a bucket of grease
chock-full of nuts and bolts.

21:17.575 --> 21:19.408
- Plankton,
I don't want to eat this!

21:19.410 --> 21:23.078
- Don't you ruin this for me,
SpongeBoob.

21:23.080 --> 21:24.813
Just eat it!

21:29.487 --> 21:30.686
Ugh.

21:31.555 --> 21:34.023
Oh, my dear
Shelby Naughtica,

21:34.025 --> 21:36.191
you are the most
beautiful woman

21:36.193 --> 21:38.560
I've ever laid my eye on.

21:38.562 --> 21:39.628
- Oh, Plankton-poo!

21:39.630 --> 21:41.630
You say the sweetest things.

21:41.632 --> 21:43.666
Oh, brother.

21:43.668 --> 21:46.902
- I never knew what love was
until I met you.

21:46.904 --> 21:47.536
- Oh!

21:47.538 --> 21:51.473
You have made me the happiest
girl robot in the world!

21:51.475 --> 21:53.042
- Hey, you!

21:53.044 --> 21:55.177
Get your hands off my man!

21:55.179 --> 21:56.645
- You better step off, lady.

21:56.647 --> 21:58.814
No one can make Plankton happy
like I can.

21:58.816 --> 22:01.684
We are soulmates,
and we're going to get married

22:01.686 --> 22:04.086
and print 1,347 babies.

22:04.088 --> 22:04.853
- 1,000 what?

22:04.855 --> 22:06.655
- Oh, well,
you're really in love.

22:06.657 --> 22:07.890
I won't stand in your way.

22:07.892 --> 22:09.792
Plankton's all yours.

22:09.794 --> 22:10.759
- Yeah!

22:10.761 --> 22:11.327
- No!

22:11.329 --> 22:12.728
The whole point
of this scheme

22:12.730 --> 22:14.530
was for me
to get Karen back,

22:14.532 --> 22:16.498
and now
you're ruining it!

22:16.500 --> 22:17.266
- Sorry, Plankton.

22:17.268 --> 22:19.835
You just said such
nice things to me.

22:19.837 --> 22:20.769
- Wait a second.

22:20.771 --> 22:22.638
You're not just
being a jerk?

22:22.640 --> 22:24.740
You mean,
you cooked this whole

22:24.742 --> 22:27.543
stupid scheme up
to win me back?

22:27.545 --> 22:28.711
- Of course I did.

22:28.713 --> 22:31.046
I'd do anything
for you, baby,

22:31.048 --> 22:33.682
even hang out with
this moron.

22:33.684 --> 22:35.050
- Oh, that is so sweet!

22:35.052 --> 22:37.052
- Get over here, you.

22:37.855 --> 22:41.790
Ew, it's that
fat screen saver again.

22:41.792 --> 22:42.324
- What?

22:42.326 --> 22:43.726
- Now, Karen, take it easy.

22:43.728 --> 22:45.227
- I'm gonna go now.

22:45.229 --> 22:46.662
- My motherboard
was right about you.

22:46.664 --> 22:48.163
She warned me about you.

22:48.165 --> 22:50.833
- And I should have
listened to her.
