WEBVTT

00:17.000 --> 00:18.560
<i>Previously on Babylon Berlin.</i>

00:18.640 --> 00:23.400
It is our duty
to build a bulwark against anarchy.

00:23.480 --> 00:25.760
They shot them down
like sparrows off the roof.

00:25.840 --> 00:27.280
Hang on, no one saw that.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.920
The blood is not even dry yet
and you're already covering it up.

00:30.000 --> 00:30.840
SEEKING WORK

00:31.920 --> 00:32.920
Don't you recognize me anymore?

00:33.000 --> 00:34.080
Greta!

00:34.160 --> 00:36.280
Must have been under a car.

00:36.360 --> 00:37.320
Doesn't look like an accident.

00:38.520 --> 00:40.440
He wasn't a tough guy.
I realized that too late.

00:40.800 --> 00:43.320
What else does your landlady
know about this Kardakov?

00:43.400 --> 00:44.560
<i>Allegedly, he's on tour.</i>

00:44.640 --> 00:46.640
They were all killed because of you.

00:47.320 --> 00:48.440
<i>They are all dead!</i>

00:48.520 --> 00:51.280
I wanted to ask if you
have looked into the previous tenant.

00:51.360 --> 00:54.720
Kardakov's lover
lives at Meraner Strasse, number seven.

00:54.880 --> 00:56.320
I'm meeting him.

00:56.400 --> 00:58.880
Put me through to the Soviet embassy.

01:35.280 --> 01:36.800
Hands up, police!

01:38.520 --> 01:42.120
Leni. Leni, look.

01:43.760 --> 01:44.680
Boom.

01:45.960 --> 01:47.240
Get that thing off him.

01:48.320 --> 01:50.960
He's a big boy,
he knows how it works, right?

01:51.400 --> 01:52.440
Boom.

01:53.120 --> 01:55.440
Hans, give your father
the pistol right now.

01:56.280 --> 01:57.160
No.

01:58.280 --> 01:59.560
Come on, give it to me.

02:01.480 --> 02:02.880
-Come on, give it to me.
-No.

02:02.960 --> 02:03.800
No.

02:29.880 --> 02:31.000
Svetlana!

02:32.480 --> 02:33.840
Sveta, where are you?

02:37.880 --> 02:38.720
Go on.

02:42.440 --> 02:43.680
Sveta, where are you?

02:44.120 --> 02:45.640
We need to go.

02:48.360 --> 02:49.400
What's with the masquerade?

02:49.800 --> 02:50.760
What's going on?

02:51.680 --> 02:53.680
They're coming after us.
They're already on the stairs. Svetlana, I beg you, come on!

02:56.080 --> 02:58.480
They'll shoot us right away.

03:00.720 --> 03:02.960
Not us. You.

03:28.480 --> 03:30.560
You bastard!

03:34.720 --> 03:37.280
That bastard sliced open my hand!

04:53.080 --> 04:53.920
Sveta.

05:16.040 --> 05:17.000
Done.

07:00.280 --> 07:01.120
-Give it to me.
-No!

07:02.040 --> 07:04.320
-Let go.
-Stop!

07:04.480 --> 07:05.680
-Give it to me!
-Let go!

07:06.160 --> 07:07.120
Give me that.

07:08.280 --> 07:09.880
Get lost then.

07:10.720 --> 07:13.080
THIRD CLASS NON-SMOKING

07:19.360 --> 07:20.200
Greta! Morning.

07:24.160 --> 07:25.720
Where were you last night?
I didn't find you.

07:25.800 --> 07:29.640
I thought you weren't coming back.
I had no idea where you had gone.

07:30.480 --> 07:31.480
Have you slept? Come on, then.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.920
-Berta, where's the Widow?
-Downstairs.

07:53.200 --> 07:55.320
-May I interrupt?
-You already have.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.160
I won't be long. This is Greta.

07:57.840 --> 07:59.680
-So?
-Comes highly recommended.

08:09.560 --> 08:10.440
I'm interested.

08:12.160 --> 08:13.360
She should take a shower first.

08:13.920 --> 08:16.720
The showers at the Palace
are out of order, hence the request.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.440
Vocal chords are in working order, yeah?

08:19.280 --> 08:20.720
Hello, Madam.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.440
Don't you Madam me.

08:22.840 --> 08:26.280
You may well be a beauty,
but I can't see what's underneath.

08:26.360 --> 08:29.320
-Can we borrow from the wardrobe?
-You do that anyway.

08:29.960 --> 08:30.800
Come on.

08:32.840 --> 08:35.560
-Impress me, children.
-We will.

08:41.040 --> 08:44.680
You get three marks per visit.
You'll be able to take a room by tomorrow.

08:45.600 --> 08:49.320
And you can borrow the clothes.
You just have to return them.

08:50.120 --> 08:51.640
You have to wash them, but...

08:52.240 --> 08:53.800
you can take what you like.

08:57.880 --> 08:58.720
Greta?

09:11.480 --> 09:12.400
I can't do this.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.000
But Greta, you're beautiful.

09:18.280 --> 09:19.520
But I can't do this.

09:20.320 --> 09:21.520
But why not?

09:22.280 --> 09:25.680
I promise, it's not that bad.
You can choose the guys.

09:25.760 --> 09:27.720
If you don't like them, you rebuff them.
That's how it works.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.120
Is it inflamed?

09:44.920 --> 09:45.920
A little.

09:50.960 --> 09:51.840
It's OK.

09:53.200 --> 09:54.360
We'll find something for you.

09:55.760 --> 09:56.600
Yes.

09:58.120 --> 09:59.200
Come here.

10:01.320 --> 10:02.600
Everything will be alright.

10:04.640 --> 10:05.520
My sweet Gretha.

11:00.800 --> 11:01.840
Lignose.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.560
-Stefan.
-Charlotte.

11:16.200 --> 11:19.120
-What are you doing here?
-I work here.

11:19.360 --> 11:20.920
I'm looking for a file right now.

11:23.280 --> 11:25.560
But this is
Detective Sergeant Wolter's desk.

11:25.840 --> 11:27.880
Yes, and I'm his assistant.

11:30.920 --> 11:31.920
What are you doing here?

11:32.640 --> 11:33.680
I...

11:35.120 --> 11:38.320
I'm supposed to deliver something,
but only in person. Where is he?

11:38.400 --> 11:40.680
Wolter? Somewhere in the building.

11:41.680 --> 11:45.160
-Alright, I'll come back later.
-Sure.

11:46.920 --> 11:48.880
Oh, is the invitation still valid?

11:48.960 --> 11:51.400
Go swimming at Sunday at 11 a.m.?

11:51.480 --> 11:53.760
-At the rowing club, I thought.
-Oh.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.880
Yes, of course.

11:56.520 --> 11:58.480
At the entrance. I'll take you in.

11:59.920 --> 12:00.760
Nice.

12:16.680 --> 12:19.480
I really tried everything.
More is not possible.

12:25.280 --> 12:28.280
I'd ask at the film lab,
where they store the negatives.

12:29.720 --> 12:30.560
They do?

12:30.920 --> 12:33.240
See the right-hand bottom corner,
near the perforation?

12:34.160 --> 12:35.440
It's cheap material.

12:36.080 --> 12:38.520
The film's positive,
the snippet you found,

12:38.600 --> 12:39.920
with which it was developed.

12:40.400 --> 12:41.480
-So?
-The material

12:41.560 --> 12:44.160
was imported from Yugoslavia, from Zagreb.

12:44.520 --> 12:47.520
I asked around. If I may?

12:48.520 --> 12:49.360
Of course.

12:49.680 --> 12:53.240
The only film lab
where they sometimes use Rodacor is Geyer.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.440
-Where is that?
-In Neukölln.

12:55.520 --> 12:56.680
It's a big shop.

12:57.560 --> 12:59.760
-Does that help you?
-Yes.

13:00.600 --> 13:02.040
Thank you for your efforts.

13:09.320 --> 13:10.360
Yucatan.

13:25.480 --> 13:29.600
Hello, I'd like a Cologne number.
13-0-8. Thank you.

13:49.240 --> 13:50.160
Rath.

13:50.520 --> 13:51.520
Helga, it's me.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.360
<i>-Gereon.</i>
-Can you talk?

13:53.440 --> 13:56.240
<i>Yes, of course. Did something happen?</i>

13:57.600 --> 13:59.360
I just wanted to get in touch.

14:00.200 --> 14:01.760
I had a strange dream.

14:04.320 --> 14:05.280
Of Anno.

14:06.720 --> 14:09.000
<i>I mean, of his Trakehner horse.</i>

14:09.120 --> 14:10.280
Yucatan.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.040
<i>Yes.</i> <i>Gereon?</i>

14:15.680 --> 14:16.600
Yes?

14:18.920 --> 14:20.240
<i>I miss you so much.</i>

14:20.920 --> 14:22.120
Why don't you come here?

14:23.760 --> 14:24.920
Come to Berlin.

14:26.160 --> 14:27.840
<i>But I can't just do that.</i>

14:28.440 --> 14:30.000
No one would give a damn about us.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.960
<i>-How do you mean?</i>
-I mean...

14:34.200 --> 14:35.880
It would be nice to have you here.

14:37.120 --> 14:39.960
<i>You mean, you and I</i>
<i>and two beers at Tiergarten,</i>

14:40.040 --> 14:44.040
<i>at night dancing at Resi's</i>
<i>and breakfast at Krumme Lanke?</i>

14:45.880 --> 14:47.440
<i>"Everyone once in Berlin."</i>

14:49.600 --> 14:51.040
"Everyone once in Berlin."

14:52.040 --> 14:53.520
<i>Oh, that would be nice.</i>

14:54.280 --> 14:56.080
<i>But it's not that simple.</i>

14:57.120 --> 14:58.040
Yes...

14:59.120 --> 15:01.840
You're right. It was a silly idea.

15:04.680 --> 15:05.760
I have to go now.

15:11.080 --> 15:11.920
Have you seen this?

15:12.000 --> 15:12.960
BLOODY STREET FIGHTS
- 200 DEAD?

15:26.880 --> 15:29.520
Murderers! Murderers!

15:29.600 --> 15:31.920
Murderers! Murderers...

15:37.160 --> 15:39.000
BLOODY STREET FIGHTS
- 200 DEAD?

15:39.520 --> 15:42.920
And this is
what happened to us in Oranienstrasse.

15:43.160 --> 15:45.920
The official version.
Owing to the two ladies.

15:52.240 --> 15:53.800
"...we were shot at from various sides.

15:54.880 --> 15:58.280
Some of the communists were shooting
at myself and Detective Rath."

15:58.360 --> 15:59.560
Are you serious?

15:59.640 --> 16:01.600
"A hand is washed by the other only If you want to take, give!"

16:06.040 --> 16:08.200
The top dogs are under a lot of pressure.

16:13.840 --> 16:16.480
FIGHT WITH KPD
DOWN WITH POLICE KILLERS

16:18.560 --> 16:20.360
Comrades.

16:21.120 --> 16:24.640
Workers were shot down like dogs.

16:26.560 --> 16:29.040
<i>-Flats were ransacked!</i>
-You can add your own style.

16:29.120 --> 16:31.680
<i>-Children abused!</i>
-I'm no man of words.

16:31.760 --> 16:32.960
<i>By the men</i>

16:33.040 --> 16:36.040
-behind the walls of this building here.
-God, her again.

16:39.520 --> 16:42.960
I myself witnessed
how they attempted to frame our fighters

16:43.040 --> 16:46.920
for a murder by the police.
Of two innocent women!

16:48.320 --> 16:53.000
And the chief of police
tells the public to keep cool.

16:53.840 --> 16:59.680
"Keep cool" in this situation
is the most inappropriate of all slogans.

17:02.160 --> 17:07.960
For the blood of our comrades is seeping
away in the cobblestones of our streets.

17:08.040 --> 17:11.000
Shed by those murderers in uniform.

17:15.760 --> 17:18.920
We need to put an immediate stop
to this agitation.

17:20.680 --> 17:22.760
Workers' blood is flowing in Berlin!

17:22.840 --> 17:25.760
Our blood is not still.

17:25.840 --> 17:28.360
Our blood is at boiling point!

17:32.080 --> 17:33.920
I will have the square cleared.

17:34.600 --> 17:35.720
Karl...

17:36.440 --> 17:39.160
we need to tread carefully,
not exert more pressure.

17:39.920 --> 17:42.320
Otherwise the situation will escalate
right at our doorstep.

17:42.400 --> 17:46.360
Should we give them more time
to stage a storming of the Bastille?

17:46.560 --> 17:48.160
We're not the Bastille.

17:48.520 --> 17:50.200
The Lord Mayor Böss!

17:50.880 --> 17:51.960
Gentlemen.

17:52.520 --> 17:53.520
They have gone...

17:53.600 --> 17:54.720
200 DEAD ON MAY THE FIRST?

17:54.800 --> 17:55.880
...completely wild out there.

17:55.960 --> 17:58.440
Why don't you take a seat, Lord Mayor?

17:59.680 --> 18:03.560
What are you planning to do?
The entire city is in turmoil!

18:05.200 --> 18:07.360
We have initiated a range of measures.

18:07.440 --> 18:10.280
By tonight
we'll be in total control again.

18:10.360 --> 18:11.520
What are those measures?

18:11.600 --> 18:13.920
A curfew after dark,

18:14.000 --> 18:17.080
in all affected neighborhoods.
Street-facing windows need to be closed.

18:17.160 --> 18:19.160
Civilians are banned
from carrying weapons.

18:19.240 --> 18:24.000
Noncompliance can mean
that our officers will open fire.

18:24.080 --> 18:26.800
-That's not very...
-Not very what?

18:27.600 --> 18:30.720
Our own party organ
mentions up to 200 dead.

18:30.880 --> 18:31.920
That is false information.

18:32.840 --> 18:35.440
-So?
-The hospitals report fewer casualties.

18:36.480 --> 18:39.240
And this?
"Execution by police bullets."

18:39.600 --> 18:43.480
Those are the two Kreuzberg women.
They're martyrs already.

18:43.840 --> 18:46.200
How do you want to interpret this?
Self-defense?

18:47.240 --> 18:51.000
We have a couple of witnesses from vice,
they're writing a report

18:51.080 --> 18:53.640
which will shine
the right light on things for us.

18:56.960 --> 18:58.800
Maybe there is a way
to turn the mood around.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.400
Which is?

19:01.480 --> 19:04.000
We keep learning that
it's all a question of interpretation.

19:05.280 --> 19:11.280
No one is writing "The demonstrators were
armed" or "we, the police, were attacked."

19:12.520 --> 19:14.200
But we'd need proof.

19:14.800 --> 19:17.800
An injured policeman.
Something unambiguous.

19:18.760 --> 19:21.320
Yes. Exactly.

19:24.560 --> 19:26.680
Murderers! Murderers!

19:34.160 --> 19:36.320
Inspector, this is the way out.

19:39.600 --> 19:42.600
Violence is the midwife
of every new society.

19:46.080 --> 19:48.200
This is what Marx is teaching us.

19:48.680 --> 19:53.080
And those times are violent, comrades.

19:53.920 --> 19:57.560
For each of our dead comrades...

19:57.640 --> 19:59.000
Can I become a member?

19:59.080 --> 20:00.760
Sure, register here, comrade.

20:00.840 --> 20:05.280
...we should liquidate one of the
representatives of this oppressive regime!

20:07.800 --> 20:11.080
That's the only language
those people understand.

20:11.160 --> 20:14.200
Murderers! Murderers...

20:21.080 --> 20:23.800
Alright, call a press conference.

20:24.680 --> 20:26.200
Very good. Yes.

20:45.960 --> 20:47.760
<i>Flown the nest. Both of them.</i>

20:48.400 --> 20:51.120
-When do you expect them back?
-Do I have to tell you?

20:52.080 --> 20:54.600
I can take you back to the station
where we'll write a report.

20:54.680 --> 20:57.800
I have no idea when they're back.
It's always different.

20:58.120 --> 20:58.960
They're artists.

21:00.640 --> 21:04.200
-Do you have the key to the flat?
-No, no. Not right now.

21:04.280 --> 21:06.280
-He's got it.
-Kardakov?

21:06.360 --> 21:09.120
-Yes.
-When was he here?

21:09.200 --> 21:10.640
Last night.

21:10.720 --> 21:14.280
-What?
-Yes. He had forgotten his key.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.520
And he didn't return mine, of course.

21:17.240 --> 21:20.760
-So maybe he's in?
-I thought you already rang the bell.

21:22.120 --> 21:23.880
I'll go upstairs and knock, OK?

21:24.240 --> 21:26.920
Sure, I'll wait.

21:27.640 --> 21:29.240
-Second floor?
-Yes.

21:43.880 --> 21:45.120
Miss Detective?

21:53.520 --> 21:56.840
-Nothing. Thank you. Bye.
-Bye.

22:35.040 --> 22:36.080
Someone up there?

22:59.360 --> 23:00.200
Hello?

24:02.600 --> 24:05.080
-To the Holländer.
-Yes, Mr. Trechkov.

25:24.560 --> 25:25.600
That's her.

25:26.720 --> 25:27.840
Hello, miss.

25:27.920 --> 25:29.560
Do you have your service card?

25:31.720 --> 25:35.120
There is no Johann König here.
Do you have a company name?

25:35.520 --> 25:36.960
König Film Production.

25:38.200 --> 25:40.840
König Film Production...

25:42.000 --> 25:42.920
I don't have that.

25:43.160 --> 25:44.680
Nothing at all? No?

25:46.800 --> 25:49.760
What about Krajewski, Franz?

25:52.400 --> 25:53.280
Yes, here.

25:54.640 --> 25:57.680
-Are you Mr. Krajewski?
-No, I'm his deputy.

25:57.760 --> 26:01.120
Only this gentleman
can collect the material.

26:02.600 --> 26:05.440
Alright. Who is the technical supervisor
of this order?

26:14.480 --> 26:18.840
Film 701, Sternberg,
Mrs. Dietrich 195, take three.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.400
Listen, you can't just...

26:24.360 --> 26:26.560
<i>You should have been a genius.</i>
<i>One more time.</i>

26:26.640 --> 26:30.440
Mr. Meyer, I'm sorry. I tried to stop him,
but he just walked in.

26:30.880 --> 26:32.440
What's going on, Meyer?

26:32.520 --> 26:35.240
-...that's impossible.
-I'm sorry, Mr. Director.

26:37.520 --> 26:41.480
<i>What are you thinking? Is this piano</i>
<i>playing? Am I to sing to that crap?</i>

26:41.560 --> 26:43.760
<i>That's OK for the wash tub, but not here.</i>

26:45.440 --> 26:46.600
Who's the lady?

26:47.640 --> 26:48.680
That's...

26:51.800 --> 26:52.720
Dietrich. Dietrich.

26:55.280 --> 26:57.800
Marlene Dietrich, you <i>cretin.</i>

27:01.760 --> 27:03.080
What do you want?

27:03.960 --> 27:04.920
I'm with vice.

27:05.440 --> 27:06.440
I want to talk to you.

27:07.720 --> 27:08.560
Here or at the station.

27:08.640 --> 27:10.960
Meyer, can we carry on, please?

27:11.040 --> 27:12.680
I haven't stolen my time.

27:12.760 --> 27:14.120
<i>For God's sake!</i>

27:14.200 --> 27:17.080
Please put me through to Cologne, 13-0-8.

27:20.680 --> 27:22.120
<i>-Hello?</i>
-It's me.

27:22.960 --> 27:25.600
They only ever made one copy
of each of König's films.

27:26.800 --> 27:27.840
Are you sure?

27:28.760 --> 27:31.840
<i>-Yes.</i>
-And the negative?

27:31.920 --> 27:36.080
<i>They're not storing the negatives there.</i>
<i>The courier always took them.</i>

27:36.160 --> 27:38.600
-Can you get a hold of the courier?
<i>-Yes.</i>

27:40.040 --> 27:43.920
You know I guaranteed that we would
solve this problem before the elections.

27:44.240 --> 27:45.520
I'm aware of that, Father.

27:45.600 --> 27:47.320
<i>Alright, keep me posted.</i>

28:20.760 --> 28:25.160
-Krajewski?
-Hasn't been here yet.

28:48.040 --> 28:51.080
TOWARDS SEESTRASSE
WEDDING

28:51.400 --> 28:53.640
Train to Wedding, board now.

28:57.600 --> 28:58.800
I don't have any news.

28:59.720 --> 29:00.600
But I do.

29:01.520 --> 29:02.520
I went to the film lab.

29:02.960 --> 29:05.120
Train to Wedding, please stand back.

29:08.680 --> 29:10.600
<i>Stand back!</i>

29:14.440 --> 29:15.560
He's a copper!

29:16.720 --> 29:18.640
A copper, comrades. A murderer!

29:19.800 --> 29:22.720
Hey, you. Traitor of the working classes.
Get lost!

29:23.200 --> 29:25.960
-We don't want any...
-Police pigs!

29:44.360 --> 29:45.240
And this.

29:50.080 --> 29:51.080
And this.

29:53.240 --> 29:54.640
And many more.

29:57.760 --> 29:58.920
What do you want me to do? Nothing.

30:01.720 --> 30:03.080
Absolutely nothing at all.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.200
But one day...

30:07.080 --> 30:08.360
this could change.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.560
Kardakov is outside.

30:15.400 --> 30:17.440
-Who?
-The violinist.

30:18.240 --> 30:20.640
-What does he want?
-I don't know.

30:24.880 --> 30:28.040
He's messing up my car.
He's not paying, either.

30:31.440 --> 30:34.240
Mr. Kardakov, what do you want from me?

30:36.080 --> 30:37.840
I have something for you.

30:40.400 --> 30:41.560
I didn't hear you.

30:44.200 --> 30:47.600
Gold. The gold of the Sorokins.

30:52.520 --> 30:57.320
-What? On my behalf?
-<i>You'll come and collect her?</i>

30:57.840 --> 31:01.440
-And where?
-<i>Police District 14, Charlottenburg </i>.

31:04.920 --> 31:08.480
POLICE HEADQUARTERS BERLIN
14TH DISTRICT

31:08.560 --> 31:09.440
Thank you.

31:11.680 --> 31:15.160
I know, those were dishonest methods.
But I have neither name nor rank to lose,

31:15.240 --> 31:17.440
-I get to make mistakes.
-Mistakes.

31:18.120 --> 31:21.240
Pretending to be police
and breaking into a flat is not a mistake.

31:21.320 --> 31:23.000
-What is it then?
-It's worse.

31:24.080 --> 31:26.080
-You lied to me.
-I did not.

31:26.160 --> 31:29.160
-No?
-You thought I was Böhm's assistant.

31:29.240 --> 31:31.760
I just... wanted to respond to your wish.

31:34.240 --> 31:35.920
Besides, I found something.

31:37.600 --> 31:38.480
The bullet.

31:39.240 --> 31:41.560
-The colleague at the station said...
-He's not your colleague.

31:42.280 --> 31:46.280
I'm sorry.
Your colleague said it is 6.35 calibre.

31:50.880 --> 31:53.080
Detective Inspector. Mr. Rath!

31:53.760 --> 31:55.120
Don't be like this.

31:56.520 --> 31:57.440
It's alright.

31:59.560 --> 32:03.560
By the way, Alexey Kardakov
was still there last night.

32:05.840 --> 32:06.880
Where, in Berlin?

32:07.480 --> 32:09.080
In Sorokina's flat.

32:09.600 --> 32:12.080
He had forgotten his key,
said the caretaker.

32:13.560 --> 32:18.160
-So... he really didn't leave the city.
-Looks like it.

32:19.360 --> 32:20.920
-Come on.
-Where to?

32:21.080 --> 32:23.160
We'll take a closer look
at what's in the suitcase.

32:25.800 --> 32:26.640
Let me do this. Come on.

32:49.240 --> 32:50.160
And this?

32:50.920 --> 32:51.760
Have you heard of this?

32:51.840 --> 32:52.840
THE ILYA TRECHKOV ENSEMBLE

32:53.480 --> 32:54.520
Trechkov.

32:55.960 --> 32:58.360
Kardakov and Sorokina
play with Ilya Trechkov.

32:58.880 --> 33:00.720
-I know him.
-Who is he?

33:00.800 --> 33:04.480
A famous bandmaster.
He plays with Uncle Jim at Holländer.

33:04.760 --> 33:07.680
But usually with a different band.
On Saturdays.

33:08.560 --> 33:09.400
That's today.

33:10.640 --> 33:13.280
-That's great, we'll go.
-We?

33:14.480 --> 33:16.000
Why should I take you with me?

33:16.400 --> 33:18.720
Because I know where Holländer is
and you don't.

33:19.120 --> 33:20.600
And no one else you know does.

33:20.880 --> 33:23.760
-And if they knew they wouldn't tell you.
-Oh yeah?

33:24.120 --> 33:26.040
Yes, you're the police.

33:29.400 --> 33:30.240
Are you eating this?

33:39.840 --> 33:42.400
Ortgies, 6.35 calibre.
What does that tell you?

33:43.720 --> 33:45.600
-Would be fitting for Kardakov.
-Why?

33:46.280 --> 33:47.480
It's a "weapon for the opera".

33:48.120 --> 33:50.240
Used by people
who don't know how to shoot.

33:50.600 --> 33:52.800
Musicians, artists, and such like.

33:57.080 --> 33:59.520
So, tonight, 9 p.m. at Holländer.

34:00.800 --> 34:05.120
Nine? No point in going there
before midnight. More like 1 or 2 a.m.

34:07.240 --> 34:10.840
-Alright, midnight then.
-Friedrichstrasse station. It's nearby.

34:13.720 --> 34:17.480
I'm with <i>Weltbühne.</i>
I'm an accredited journalist. Excuse me...

34:22.560 --> 34:23.600
Hello, neighbor.

34:24.240 --> 34:26.880
Mr. Katelbach. What's going on?

34:26.960 --> 34:29.560
Your <i>Presidentsky</i>
is trying to save his honor.

34:29.640 --> 34:32.160
Like, if the reds shoot, so can we.

34:32.240 --> 34:35.960
I'm afraid we're missing half of it.
You wouldn't happen to know a back door?

34:36.040 --> 34:37.840
<i>Gentlemen,</i>
<i>welcome to this press conference.</i>

34:39.480 --> 34:43.200
<i>We called it to shed the right light</i>
<i>on some things.</i>

34:43.280 --> 34:44.800
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

34:45.320 --> 34:47.880
Excuse me. The gentleman is with me.

34:48.840 --> 34:51.880
It wasn't the police
who incited the riots,

34:52.000 --> 34:54.160
but the communist associations

34:54.240 --> 34:58.120
who, without any respect of state order,

34:58.200 --> 35:02.000
called for an attack on the police forces

35:02.080 --> 35:06.840
who were there for de-escalation.

35:08.120 --> 35:11.320
Let me introduce one of our heroes to you,

35:11.640 --> 35:14.280
whose brave commitment for law and order

35:14.360 --> 35:17.800
received a hail of bullets from
trigger-happy Bolsheviks in thanks.

35:18.080 --> 35:19.920
Constable Fritz Dörr.

35:24.640 --> 35:25.800
A true hero, him?

35:27.640 --> 35:28.560
Lies!

35:29.080 --> 35:30.040
<i>Boom.</i>

35:32.000 --> 35:32.880
Great.

35:33.160 --> 35:34.880
On behalf of the Fatherland: Thank you.

35:35.320 --> 35:36.200
Great.

35:55.520 --> 35:57.800
WANTED: CARETAKER, SECRETARY
CLEANING PERSONNEL

35:57.880 --> 35:59.960
MECHANICS, GUARDSMEN,
DOG HANDLERS, ARCHIVERS

36:00.040 --> 36:02.440
Hello. I have an application.

36:02.520 --> 36:03.680
For deputy inspector.

36:03.760 --> 36:04.960
-Department?
-Homicide.

36:06.200 --> 36:08.040
Do you have your certificate of conduct?

36:08.600 --> 36:11.080
-I'll hand it in later.
-Put it in there...

36:12.640 --> 36:15.680
APPLICATIONS

36:23.920 --> 36:26.520
Housemaid wanted.

36:26.600 --> 36:28.600
State councillor Benda.

36:36.280 --> 36:38.760
-Is this the exact wording?
-Yes.

36:39.080 --> 36:40.080
Very good.

36:41.920 --> 36:44.120
Any other new findings?

36:46.000 --> 36:47.480
Unforeseen risks?

36:49.080 --> 36:51.880
I'm invisible. I'm sure of it.

36:53.320 --> 36:55.600
You must never be sure of anything.

36:58.280 --> 36:59.440
Of course.

37:00.720 --> 37:02.840
You know how sensitive this affair is.

37:04.160 --> 37:06.920
At some point the decisive clue
will present itself.

37:07.880 --> 37:10.280
We must not miss this moment.

37:10.840 --> 37:12.680
I know, Mr. Councillor.

37:16.120 --> 37:19.640
-You're doing a good job, Stefan.
-Thank you.

37:21.320 --> 37:24.080
But strike the word "security"
from your vocabulary.

37:24.160 --> 37:25.240
Yes, sir.

37:49.040 --> 37:52.360
-Excuse me.
-Wow! You look good.

37:53.920 --> 37:55.920
How charming! Come.

38:16.040 --> 38:17.560
-Evening.
-Evening.

38:22.600 --> 38:25.120
<i>Bellissima! </i>How you light up our house.

38:26.600 --> 38:28.640
Shall we go powder our nose?

38:29.600 --> 38:30.760
I'll be right back.

38:39.440 --> 38:42.960
<i>Then I always only think of you</i>

38:45.880 --> 38:49.320
<i>Then I always think of you</i>

38:52.520 --> 38:54.240
<i>And I tell myself</i>

38:55.200 --> 38:59.640
<i>My rose, stay and never forget me</i>

39:13.560 --> 39:14.640
Inspector?

39:19.480 --> 39:20.480
Mr. Gräf!

39:21.400 --> 39:24.520
-I didn't expect you here.
-I didn't expect you, either.

39:27.080 --> 39:28.480
Excuse me.

39:29.480 --> 39:30.400
And good evening.

39:31.320 --> 39:33.800
-Amazing as always.
-Same goes for you.

39:34.160 --> 39:35.640
Hello, darling.

39:35.720 --> 39:37.760
Long time no see. Everything fine?

39:37.840 --> 39:40.240
-Yes. And yourself?
-Good.

39:40.320 --> 39:42.120
I'll have what he's having.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.840
Lemonade for the lady.

39:45.640 --> 39:48.160
What? With a shot, please.

39:48.240 --> 39:49.400
And you?
Thanks.

39:49.480 --> 39:51.280
I have to go back to my family.

39:51.360 --> 39:52.640
Inspector.

40:05.120 --> 40:07.640
Is that Trechkov? On stage?

40:09.720 --> 40:11.880
Yes, that's him.
We'll meet him in the break.

40:18.440 --> 40:19.640
Shall we?

40:24.840 --> 40:26.600
Oh, Kardakov.

40:27.880 --> 40:30.400
He's wasting his talent, the moron.

40:30.720 --> 40:34.160
I hate him.
He's so gifted you have to hate him.

40:35.120 --> 40:37.840
I told him, you are our real star.

40:38.160 --> 40:40.800
Your crazy violin is of the devil.

40:40.880 --> 40:43.360
And he goes off to play revolution.

40:43.440 --> 40:46.240
I hate him. I hate that fortress.

40:46.680 --> 40:49.320
-The Red Fortress, right?
-The whole bunch is crazy.

40:49.400 --> 40:51.720
They actually think
they could topple Stalin.

40:52.200 --> 40:54.680
The whole thing is a ghastly idiocy.

40:54.800 --> 41:00.080
The leader, Trotsky, is down in Turkey,
wasting the lives of other people.

41:00.160 --> 41:02.320
-I hate him.
-What about the countess,

41:02.400 --> 41:04.440
-Ms. Sorokina?
-Oh, her.

41:05.680 --> 41:07.360
She's made it all worse.

41:08.720 --> 41:10.160
She's turned his head.

41:11.200 --> 41:13.000
Then she ran off with him.

41:14.200 --> 41:15.480
I hate her.

41:16.160 --> 41:17.800
Where could this Kardakov be?

41:18.840 --> 41:21.680
I swore I would keep it to myself, but...

41:23.400 --> 41:25.560
discretion is not my passion.

41:28.840 --> 41:30.360
In Köpenick.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.600
At Wormsstrasse.

41:35.320 --> 41:37.000
There's some kind of basement.

41:37.760 --> 41:39.520
In there is a printer's.

41:41.080 --> 41:41.960
And?

41:43.080 --> 41:45.480
It's the headquarter of the Red Fortress. -I love that piece.
-So do I.

42:00.880 --> 42:03.600
-What?
-Want to dance?

42:03.680 --> 42:04.640
Are you serious? Are you married, by the way?

42:25.120 --> 42:25.960
No.

42:26.240 --> 42:27.600
But going steady?

42:27.840 --> 42:28.800
It's not that simple.

42:30.200 --> 42:32.280
"Love is not simple.
It's very complicated.

42:32.360 --> 42:34.720
Or our Sigismund wouldn't have
embarrassed himself."

42:36.080 --> 42:37.280
-And you?
-Me?

42:37.600 --> 42:40.120
Go steady? Spare me.

42:40.840 --> 42:43.160
Why do people see that differently,
but not in Berlin?

42:43.240 --> 42:46.520
We're just a bit faster than the rest.
Of the fair people.

42:46.600 --> 42:48.600
Always a quick answer,
even if it isn't one.

42:48.880 --> 42:50.640
A quick answer is better
than slow silence right?

42:50.920 --> 42:52.080
And always the last word. No.

43:42.040 --> 43:43.160
What time is it? I'll take you home now.

43:47.840 --> 43:48.760
No.

43:48.840 --> 43:50.000
But I have to run.

43:50.080 --> 43:51.280
No back talk.

43:52.480 --> 43:54.320
This is most kind, Mr. Rath, but...

43:54.840 --> 43:56.080
I have plans.

43:57.600 --> 43:58.560
See you tomorrow.

44:02.960 --> 44:03.800
Home after all?

44:09.680 --> 44:10.680
No, but...

44:11.640 --> 44:13.800
do I get paid by someone for this?

44:16.600 --> 44:18.240
For my work?

44:20.800 --> 44:22.000
I have no idea.

44:23.880 --> 44:24.800
How do you mean?

44:27.840 --> 44:29.280
We've only just started.

44:30.640 --> 44:32.520
Alright. Bye.

45:31.840 --> 45:35.040
<i>It must be just a dream</i>

45:35.480 --> 45:40.000
<i>Trying to snatch the wind</i>

45:40.080 --> 45:43.720
<i>Who really knows?</i>

45:46.520 --> 45:49.640
<i>The clock on your wall</i>

45:50.120 --> 45:53.280
<i>It is filled with sand</i>

45:53.840 --> 45:57.520
<i>Put your hand in mine</i>

45:57.600 --> 46:00.360
<i>And let us be forever</i>

46:01.280 --> 46:04.520
<i>Now you make your choice</i>

46:04.880 --> 46:09.440
<i>And throw us</i>
<i>in between happiness and agony</i>

46:09.520 --> 46:13.880
<i>But I can forgive you</i>

46:15.880 --> 46:18.960
<i>You are very close to death</i>

46:19.480 --> 46:22.520
<i>But your eye still clear</i>

46:22.600 --> 46:25.880
<i>Does it recognize me? I'm ready</i>

46:25.960 --> 46:31.320
<i>To seek immortality with you</i>
