Yeah, I'm sorry.
My bad, man.

08:28.464 --> 08:30.118
I'm just feeling untethered

08:30.161 --> 08:32.207
because my baby girl
is lying to me.

08:32.250 --> 08:33.295
And she's bad at it.

08:33.338 --> 08:34.688
Oh, come on, Kenan.

08:34.731 --> 08:36.603
I used to lie all the time
when I was a kid.

08:36.646 --> 08:38.561
I turned out great.
- Well, you're not great.

08:38.605 --> 08:40.041
You sleep next
to my water heater.

08:40.084 --> 08:41.608
I'm with Kenan
on this one, man.

08:41.651 --> 08:43.958
Lying's not good unless you're
doing it for the schmoney.

08:44.001 --> 08:45.481
Low and slow.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.744
Will you please
stop doing schmoney squats?

08:47.788 --> 08:49.790
- Okay.
- I got to nip this lying thing

08:49.833 --> 08:51.792
in the bud, man, or
she's going start sneaking out

08:51.835 --> 08:54.708
and drinking and vaping
and meeting up with boys

08:54.751 --> 08:57.493
in parking lots
to do Lord knows what.

08:57.537 --> 09:00.365
I met my first ex-wife
in a parking lot.

09:00.409 --> 09:02.411
Okay, do what Dad did, man.

09:02.454 --> 09:04.761
Just back her into a corner and
force her to tell the truth.

09:04.805 --> 09:06.937
After that, she'll think twice
about lying to you.

09:06.981 --> 09:08.373
You know,
that did always work.

09:08.417 --> 09:10.332
I thought you guys told me
he was kind of a jerk.

09:10.375 --> 09:11.681
Don't you ever talk bad
about my daddy like that!

09:11.725 --> 09:14.162
- Cecil Williams was a saint!
- My bad.

09:14.205 --> 09:15.555
That's our bad, actually.

09:15.598 --> 09:17.339
I don't know where all
that aggression came from.

09:17.382 --> 09:18.906
I know exactly
where it came from.

09:18.949 --> 09:20.211
Don't do it no more.

09:20.255 --> 09:21.735
Yeah, but Dad did
go kind of hard, man.

09:21.778 --> 09:24.215
I always swore I would never
go that hard with my kids.

09:24.259 --> 09:25.652
But maybe I can do,
like, a half-Cecil.

09:25.695 --> 09:27.001
- A nice half-Cecil.
- Half-Cecil.

09:27.044 --> 09:28.393
Just nudge her
into the corner

09:28.437 --> 09:30.265
and have a little tête-à-tête
with her

09:30.308 --> 09:31.658
until she têtes the truth.

09:31.701 --> 09:33.355
Well, just don't
do anything stupid.

09:33.398 --> 09:34.835
Yeah, don't be
doing nothing stupid.

09:34.878 --> 09:36.358
Oh, oh, Gary.
Time to break it down now.

09:36.401 --> 09:37.620
- Like a squat.
- Whoo!

09:37.664 --> 09:39.187
- And drop it like a squat.
- Schmoney squat.

09:39.230 --> 09:41.319
- And drop it like a squat.
- And schmoney...

09:41.363 --> 09:43.583
<i>Here we are.</i>

09:43.626 --> 09:47.021
What are we doing?
This isn't Yogurtland.

09:47.064 --> 09:49.806
Oh, I'm sorry.
I must've lied.

09:49.850 --> 09:52.940
We are at your first
womanly doctor's appointment

09:52.983 --> 09:55.638
so you can go in there and
talk to a medical professional

09:55.682 --> 09:59.555
about your first period
that you definitely just got.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.470
Or, hey,
if you're uncomfortable,

10:01.513 --> 10:03.211
I'm open
to just going to Yogurtland

10:03.254 --> 10:06.518
and talking about
why we're not at the doctor.

10:06.562 --> 10:10.261
Well, we're here,
so let's do it.

10:10.305 --> 10:11.741
[car beeping]

10:11.785 --> 10:13.569
Oh, you--you going--

10:13.613 --> 10:15.266
All right, well,

10:15.310 --> 10:17.225
I guess I got to find
a real parking spot now.

10:17.268 --> 10:18.705
All right.
[tires screech]

10:18.748 --> 10:20.663
Mm, okay. One second.
I'ma find a sp--

10:20.707 --> 10:23.013
Oh, that's neutral.
Okay. Here we go.

10:23.057 --> 10:24.493
Yep. No.

10:24.536 --> 10:26.451
You know what?
I'ma just leave it right here.

10:26.495 --> 10:29.106
[horn honks]
Whoo.

10:29.150 --> 10:30.847
Oh, what's up, ladies?

10:30.891 --> 10:33.502
I just came by
to say I was 100% right

10:33.545 --> 10:36.418
about there being no downside
to Key-Whole.

10:36.461 --> 10:39.073
I mean, I've been an influencer
only a few days,

10:39.116 --> 10:41.423
and it's already
off the chain.

10:41.466 --> 10:44.469
Oh, or should I say
on the chain?

10:44.513 --> 10:46.428
[chain clattering]
Oh!

10:46.471 --> 10:48.909
- That thing looks expensive.
- Oh, it is.

10:48.952 --> 10:50.650
$5,000 a month.

10:50.693 --> 10:52.260
I leased it.

10:52.303 --> 10:54.262
Yeah, it's like a Bentley
on my neck.

10:54.305 --> 10:56.568
Weighs like one, too.
[chuckles]

10:56.612 --> 10:58.701
Mm, hurts so good.
[chuckles]

10:58.745 --> 11:01.312
[phone chimes]
Oh! Uh-oh, what's that?

11:01.356 --> 11:03.097
Oh, I got to jet, y'all.

11:03.140 --> 11:04.664
Somebody just offered me $100

11:04.707 --> 11:07.144
to eat a bowl of spaghetti
in the men's room.

11:07.188 --> 11:08.624
Garebear got work to do.
[phone chimes]

11:08.668 --> 11:11.932
Oh, 150 to do it on the floor.

11:11.975 --> 11:13.455
I can't stop winning.

11:13.498 --> 11:15.196
What's that, chain?
We ballin'.

11:15.239 --> 11:18.373
I know.
Ooh, it's so heavy.

11:18.416 --> 11:19.809
It's so heavy.

11:19.853 --> 11:21.289
This is not working.

11:21.332 --> 11:22.812
We created these
fake Key-Whole followers

11:22.856 --> 11:24.640
to show him that
there's a downside to this,

11:24.684 --> 11:26.468
not to turn him
into Bobby Brown.

11:26.511 --> 11:29.123
[laptop chimes]
- Oh, hey, he's on.

11:29.166 --> 11:31.429
How did he get spaghetti
so fast?

11:31.473 --> 11:33.040
The things a brother will do

11:33.083 --> 11:34.737
for an 18-karat
gold Cuban link.

11:34.781 --> 11:36.043
That chain is fire, though.
- Yeah.

11:36.086 --> 11:37.479
<i>[toilet flushes]</i> <i>
- Aw, yeah.</i>

11:37.522 --> 11:39.133
<i>Appreciate that</i> <i>
courtesy flush, bro-bro.</i>

11:39.176 --> 11:41.831
We've got
to up our game, ladies.

11:41.875 --> 11:43.659
- We're playing this too safe.
- Mm-hmm.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.617
It's time to take this
to the gutter.

11:45.661 --> 11:47.141
I don't know
if Gary minds the gutter.

11:47.184 --> 11:49.796
He just ate a meatball
that rolled under the urinal.

11:49.839 --> 11:50.840
Yuck!

11:53.190 --> 11:54.844
[telephone ringing,
indistinct chatter]

11:54.888 --> 11:56.237
Well, all right.

11:56.280 --> 11:59.327
I just made that copayment
that's nonrefundable.

11:59.370 --> 12:01.416
Okay, thanks.

12:02.678 --> 12:03.940
We got to fill out
this paperwork

12:03.984 --> 12:07.204
and, uh, answer the questions
with honesty.

12:07.248 --> 12:08.205
I got you.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.949
And then
you gonna get a period shot.

12:15.822 --> 12:17.127
A period shot?

12:17.171 --> 12:18.868
That's not a thing.
- Yeah, it is.

12:18.912 --> 12:20.478
It's something new that
they've been trying lately,

12:20.522 --> 12:23.525
you know, just to keep your
lady parts flush with enzymes.

12:23.568 --> 12:24.961
It's Fauci-approved.

12:25.005 --> 12:28.182
But if you don't need it
for any reason,

12:28.225 --> 12:30.750
this would be the time
to tell me.

12:32.447 --> 12:34.405
Whatever I have to do.

12:35.972 --> 12:38.235
Oh. Hey, Doctor.

12:38.279 --> 12:40.498
Hey. Kenan.
Big fan, I'm sure.

12:40.542 --> 12:44.328
Listen, my daughter told me
that she got her first period,

12:44.372 --> 12:46.722
but, actually, it was the girl
from "This is Us."

12:46.766 --> 12:48.550
Ooh, that was
a great episode.

12:48.593 --> 12:50.378
Not realistic,
but still good.

12:50.421 --> 12:51.814
I'm sorry, what does this
have to do with me, sir?

12:51.858 --> 12:53.816
Well, I think
I can get her to confess

12:53.860 --> 12:55.035
if you help me convince her

12:55.078 --> 12:56.819
that she's gonna get
a period shot.

12:56.863 --> 12:59.430
Period shot?
That's not a thing.

12:59.474 --> 13:02.303
I know it's not, but
I already told her that it was.

13:02.346 --> 13:03.695
And, you know,
she's been scared of needles

13:03.739 --> 13:04.871
since she was,
like, a little girl,

13:04.914 --> 13:06.307
so all I need you to do
is, like,

13:06.350 --> 13:08.788
approach her real slow
with a big-ass needle,

13:08.831 --> 13:10.180
like you gonna stab her
a bunch of times

13:10.224 --> 13:11.834
or something like that,
and then she'll break down

13:11.878 --> 13:13.096
in apologetic tears.

13:13.140 --> 13:14.837
I'll win, and then she'll know

13:14.881 --> 13:16.708
never to lie
to her father again.

13:16.752 --> 13:19.624
Uh-uh,
I suggest you go home

13:19.668 --> 13:24.020
and have a real conversation
with your daughter, sir.

13:24.064 --> 13:26.022
If he doesn't leave,
call security.

13:26.066 --> 13:27.502
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, it's like that?

13:27.545 --> 13:29.852
I ask you to threaten my
daughter and you threaten me?

13:29.896 --> 13:31.375
What kind of establishment
is this?

13:31.419 --> 13:33.769
Dad, what's going on?

13:33.813 --> 13:35.118
I'll tell you
what's going on, Aubrey.

13:35.162 --> 13:36.728
You lied to me,
all right?

13:36.772 --> 13:38.426
And you need to admit it.

13:38.469 --> 13:39.557
You lied. Admit it.

13:39.601 --> 13:42.517
Fine. I lied.
Can we go home now?

13:42.560 --> 13:44.214
You--yes, we can!

13:44.258 --> 13:47.261
And don't you--
[exhales deeply]

13:47.304 --> 13:49.393
Excuse me, I'm gonna need
that copayment back,

13:49.437 --> 13:50.873
if you don't mind.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.962
[laptop chimes]
- Ooh, I got a new one.

13:53.006 --> 13:55.051
"Shave your body smooth
like a chocolate dolphin

13:55.095 --> 13:56.574
"while you type
a angry letter

13:56.618 --> 13:58.402
to Robin Roberts
with your feet."

13:58.446 --> 14:00.361
For $200?

14:00.404 --> 14:02.580
What kind of freaky-deaky freak
is into this?

14:02.624 --> 14:04.495
Absolutely not.

14:04.539 --> 14:06.149
[gasps]
He declined?

14:06.193 --> 14:08.369
We got to go all-in
if we're gonna break him.

14:08.412 --> 14:11.241
Ooh, I'll get
the petty cash card.

14:11.285 --> 14:13.461
Ooh, yeah.

14:13.504 --> 14:14.897
[laptop chimes]

14:14.941 --> 14:17.291
For $1,100?

14:17.334 --> 14:19.946
Freak-deaky damn.

14:25.386 --> 14:26.735
Ahh.

14:26.778 --> 14:28.041
Yeah, just what
the doctor ordered.

14:28.084 --> 14:29.433
Thank you, brother.

14:29.477 --> 14:31.522
I've been working on that
for 15 minutes.

14:31.566 --> 14:33.481
Well, you need a year,
'cause this taste like garbage.

14:33.524 --> 14:35.918
I don't know about
this Key-Whole thing, man.

14:35.962 --> 14:37.789
Doing some of this stuff
for money

14:37.833 --> 14:39.226
got my stomach all twisted up.

14:39.269 --> 14:41.184
Is this what shame feels like?

14:41.228 --> 14:42.838
Yep. I guess you could quit,

14:42.882 --> 14:44.666
but Allied Bank
would probably come

14:44.709 --> 14:46.755
and repossess
that fancy gold chain of yours.

14:46.798 --> 14:48.539
It's crazy, man--I thought
the chain was working for me,

14:48.583 --> 14:50.977
but now I feel like
I'm working for the chain.

14:51.020 --> 14:52.892
- That's almost a haiku.
- What?

14:52.935 --> 14:54.502
Sounds like you've got
a decision to make.

14:54.545 --> 14:56.634
I don't want to hear it.
Go to your room.

14:56.678 --> 14:57.940
I was already going.

14:57.984 --> 15:01.161
Yeah, and you better
get up there quick.

15:01.204 --> 15:04.555
Man, good Lord, what is going
on with these kids today?

15:04.599 --> 15:06.122
My goodness.

15:06.166 --> 15:08.646
[spits]
Oh, man, that's awful.

15:08.690 --> 15:11.867
How do people even drink that?
Uh, I'll have some wine.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.347
I am not a bartender.

15:13.390 --> 15:15.479
Yeah, and with drinks
like that, you never will be.

15:15.523 --> 15:17.003
[scoffs]

15:17.046 --> 15:19.179
Man, Aubrey has lost her mind.

15:19.222 --> 15:21.442
I cannot believe how
unapologetic she is

15:21.485 --> 15:23.052
about lying to me.

15:23.096 --> 15:24.836
Oh, man,
they turn on you quickly.

15:24.880 --> 15:26.316
One day,
they're your little baby.

15:26.360 --> 15:27.883
And the next day,
they're dating Lil Baby.

15:27.927 --> 15:28.971
Too many little babies.

15:29.015 --> 15:31.060
Well, not on my watch,
all right?

15:31.104 --> 15:33.019
Nothing else
I've been trying is working,

15:33.062 --> 15:35.456
so I'm just gonna have
to go full Cecil now.

15:35.499 --> 15:37.545
Hey, you better do it
for Daddy, bro.

15:37.588 --> 15:39.677
- [scoffs]
- Do it for Daddy. [chuckles]

15:39.721 --> 15:41.505
Ah, hell with it.

15:43.116 --> 15:46.597
Aubrey, we need
to talk right now.

15:46.641 --> 15:49.339
Ooh, Daddy, what did she do?
What did you do, Aubrey?

15:49.383 --> 15:51.515
Hey, baby, why don't you play
with your tablet

15:51.559 --> 15:53.343
and go downstairs
and watch TV, hmm?

15:53.387 --> 15:56.172
Now you're offering me
two screens?

15:56.216 --> 15:58.174
Whatever you're doing,
keep it up.

16:01.873 --> 16:04.528
I already admitted I lied.
What more do you want?

16:04.572 --> 16:07.967
I want you to drop
the attitude and apologize.

16:08.010 --> 16:09.664
No, because
if you had just let me

16:09.707 --> 16:11.492
hang out with my friends
at Atlantic Station,

16:11.535 --> 16:13.146
none of this
would be happening.

16:13.189 --> 16:15.017
I'm not a baby anymore.

16:15.061 --> 16:16.888
Okay, you're grounded.

16:16.932 --> 16:18.716
Great.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.892
Great? Give me your phone.

16:20.936 --> 16:23.112
- Fine.
- Fine?

16:23.156 --> 16:25.506
Oh, I'll take
your computer, too.

16:25.549 --> 16:27.247
You're gonna want
to charge it.

16:27.290 --> 16:29.205
Charge it?
I'm gonna want to ch--

16:29.249 --> 16:31.164
Oh, she telling me
I might want to charge--

16:31.207 --> 16:32.861
You want to keep going?
I'll keep going all night.

16:32.904 --> 16:34.471
You like your bed?

16:34.515 --> 16:36.038
[sighs]

16:36.082 --> 16:37.997
What now...

16:38.040 --> 16:39.868
Kenan?

16:39.911 --> 16:43.045
Don't call me Kenan.

16:43.089 --> 16:44.960
Lord, give me the strength.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.006
Mandela!

16:49.095 --> 16:50.966
Aubrey is out of control.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.707
You remember those
scared-straight dudes

16:52.750 --> 16:54.100
we did the segment on?
- Yeah.

16:54.143 --> 16:55.710
I'm thinking maybe we get
them a weekend pass

16:55.753 --> 16:57.059
and have them come
into my house.

16:57.103 --> 16:58.887
No, I don't want them
knowing where I live.

16:58.930 --> 17:01.759
Oh, man. What would
my daddy do to break her?

17:01.803 --> 17:03.065
It's not waterboarding, but--

17:03.109 --> 17:05.067
Kenan, you don't need
to break her.

17:05.111 --> 17:08.157
Mika, you weren't there.
You didn't see her crazy eyes.

17:08.201 --> 17:09.550
They were like Phil's doll.

17:09.593 --> 17:11.769
And she wouldn't take
any responsibility.

17:11.813 --> 17:15.077
Oh, so like father,
like daughter, am I right?

17:15.121 --> 17:17.079
[clears throat] Okay, look,
I'm gonna tell you something

17:17.123 --> 17:18.211
you don't want to hear.

17:18.254 --> 17:19.386
You ready?
- No.

17:19.429 --> 17:20.909
Aubrey was wrong
for lying to you,

17:20.952 --> 17:22.650
but she wasn't wrong about you

17:22.693 --> 17:24.086
needing to give her
a little more independence.

17:24.130 --> 17:25.609
But I need to keep he close
to keep her safe,

17:25.653 --> 17:27.089
otherwise she'll be out there

17:27.133 --> 17:28.917
getting into all kinds of trouble.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.919
- I ever tell you about my dad?
- No. Was he a Tuskegee Airman?

17:30.962 --> 17:32.790
'Cause that syphilis thing
was messed up.

17:32.834 --> 17:35.271
What? No, he was
a Philadelphia factory worker.

17:35.315 --> 17:37.099
Super strict about everything.

17:37.143 --> 17:39.145
So, one night,
I snuck out the house

17:39.188 --> 17:42.409
to go to Angie Palladino's
8th-grade graduation party.

17:42.452 --> 17:45.064
What? You snuck out?

17:45.107 --> 17:48.241
Yeah. And I also raided
her parents' liquor cabinet,

17:48.284 --> 17:49.503
then wound up in the hospital

17:49.546 --> 17:51.244
and had to get
my stomach pumped.

17:51.287 --> 17:52.593
Oh, snap.

17:52.636 --> 17:54.116
You see,
being under my dad's thumb

17:54.160 --> 17:56.771
didn't stop me
from getting into trouble.

17:56.814 --> 17:59.687
And, you know, if Aubrey's
anything like I was,

17:59.730 --> 18:01.297
she'll just rebel even harder

18:01.341 --> 18:04.257
and do all the things that
you're worried about and more.

18:04.300 --> 18:07.260
Yeah. You mean, like,
the boys and drinking

18:07.303 --> 18:09.523
and vaping and Lord knows what.

18:09.566 --> 18:11.612
Yeah, Lord knows what.

18:11.655 --> 18:14.049
Or you can loosen the reins

18:14.093 --> 18:17.618
and give her
a little more space to roam.

18:17.661 --> 18:19.272
You saying I should
buy her a horse?

18:19.315 --> 18:20.795
'Cause that'd be easier.
- Kenan.

18:20.838 --> 18:22.623
So you really think
she did all this

18:22.666 --> 18:24.973
just to prove she's an adult?
- Mm-hmm.

18:25.016 --> 18:27.149
Maybe you're right.
Thank you, Mika.

18:27.193 --> 18:31.458
It's just--seeing my kids
growing up is such a trip.

18:31.501 --> 18:34.025
Makes me understand why we had
such crazy-ass daddies.

18:34.069 --> 18:36.158
Don't you talk
about my daddy.

18:36.202 --> 18:37.899
See?

18:37.942 --> 18:39.640
Oh, I guess
we're done talking.

18:39.683 --> 18:40.989
<i>Wake up, wake up,</i> <i>
wake up, wake up.</i>

18:41.032 --> 18:42.947
<i>Hi, there.</i> <i>
I'm Saffron Spice.</i>

18:42.991 --> 18:46.473
<i>Today we are gonna fry</i> <i>
some fish.</i>

18:46.516 --> 18:47.822
<i>Ooh.</i>

18:47.865 --> 18:50.738
So, Saffron, you must be
pretty adventurous

18:50.781 --> 18:53.262
to have a fully nude fish fry.

18:53.306 --> 18:55.612
Well, the splash back
and popping could be annoying

18:55.656 --> 18:57.136
if you're not into that,

18:57.179 --> 18:59.355
but, overall,
it's really empowering

18:59.399 --> 19:03.838
to make that kind of money
doing what you love naked.

19:03.881 --> 19:05.100
Wrong.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.102
Oh, sounds like Gary
has a counterpoint.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.712
Yes, I do.

19:08.756 --> 19:12.020
Look, I thought Key-Wholing
had no downsides.

19:12.063 --> 19:15.197
Turns out mo' schmoney,
mo' problems.

19:15.241 --> 19:18.374
That Key-Whole leads
to the devil's door.

19:18.418 --> 19:20.811
Hmm, just lucky
your boy got out

19:20.855 --> 19:23.031
before I did anything
I couldn't live with.

19:23.074 --> 19:25.294
- Oh, did you, though?
- Mm-hmm.

19:25.338 --> 19:27.818
- Let's roll the tape.
- I'm sorry. What?

19:29.298 --> 19:31.039
I'm a chocolate dolphin.

19:31.082 --> 19:32.997
[poorly imitates
dolphin squealing]

19:33.041 --> 19:35.652
[laughter]

19:35.696 --> 19:38.220
Don't judge me. I have to pay
off this chain, man, come on.

19:38.264 --> 19:41.963
[stammers] Wait, how'd you get
my premium content?

19:42.006 --> 19:45.880
We'll be right back with
Saffron Spice and Garebear XXX.

19:45.923 --> 19:48.230
We're clear.
[bell ringing]

19:48.274 --> 19:50.406
[laughter continues]

19:50.450 --> 19:52.800
- Got him.
- Y'all set me up.

19:52.843 --> 19:55.716
You just got bitch-pranked!

19:55.759 --> 19:57.239
Dang it,
I-I messed up my moment.

19:57.283 --> 19:58.501
It's okay.

19:58.545 --> 19:59.981
Look, in all fairness,

20:00.024 --> 20:02.375
we needed another passionate
guest for the segment,

20:02.418 --> 20:05.552
and we wanted to embarrass
the hell out of you.

20:05.595 --> 20:07.249
[laughter]
- We did.

20:07.293 --> 20:10.731
- Typing with your toes.
- Y'all so wrong for this.

20:10.774 --> 20:12.733
Y'all so wrong for this, man!

20:12.776 --> 20:15.736
[laughter continues]

20:15.779 --> 20:18.956
Hey, um, Saffron,
why don't you--

20:19.000 --> 20:23.178
How about you cook me dinner
tonight and cheer me up?

20:23.222 --> 20:25.180
Hmm.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.922
Chain still worth it, baby.
[chuckles]

20:27.965 --> 20:30.620
You see that?
Still a winner!

20:32.318 --> 20:34.668
All right,
we're here at the boba shop

20:34.711 --> 20:36.452
where all your friends is at,
Miss Daisy.

20:36.496 --> 20:39.803
I'm pretty sure
that's racist, Dad, but thanks.

20:39.847 --> 20:43.720
Hey, uh, look,
I'm loosening the reins,

20:43.764 --> 20:46.506
but, remember, I need you
to be honest with me

20:46.549 --> 20:49.073
so I can help you navigate this
growing-up thing, all right?

20:49.117 --> 20:50.684
Okay.

20:50.727 --> 20:52.903
- You sure you ready for this?
- Yes, I'm sure.

20:52.947 --> 20:55.341
And, again, I'm really sorry
I lied to you.

20:55.384 --> 20:56.472
I love you, Daddy.

20:56.516 --> 20:57.821
I love...
[car door closes]

20:57.865 --> 20:59.127
Hey, Aubrey!

20:59.170 --> 21:01.390
You, too.

21:01.434 --> 21:02.783
Don't worry, Daddy.

21:02.826 --> 21:04.654
This Birdie's
never flying the coop.

21:04.698 --> 21:06.134
Oh, thank you, baby.

21:06.177 --> 21:08.136
I mean,
I still play with dolls.

21:08.179 --> 21:09.442
Oh!

21:09.485 --> 21:12.140
Hester!

21:12.183 --> 21:14.229
<i>Don't you take my baby's soul.</i>
