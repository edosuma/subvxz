01:15.761 --> 01:18.129
Oh, what's up, boy?

01:24.270 --> 01:26.538
Oh, headshot. Nah.

01:26.540 --> 01:29.708
- Right there, right there.
- Priest. Mmm.

01:29.710 --> 01:31.612
That's Priest, man.

02:07.083 --> 02:08.782
What's up, Priest?

02:16.894 --> 02:18.225
Interior
and everything, see?

02:18.227 --> 02:19.863
Yo, Litty.

02:24.366 --> 02:27.036
Yo, Litty!

02:27.038 --> 02:29.837
You hear that?
That's my new shit.

02:29.839 --> 02:31.506
Go ahead and soak it up.

02:31.508 --> 02:34.275
- Do the thing. Yeah.
- What's up, black?

02:34.277 --> 02:36.177
Y'all good?

02:42.753 --> 02:44.789
I need to get at you
for a second, man.

02:46.732 --> 02:48.857
Oh, you need
to get at me?

02:48.859 --> 02:50.859
That's cute. Yeah,
that's what I said.

02:50.861 --> 02:53.295
Well, anything you
got to say to me,

02:53.297 --> 02:54.832
you can say it
in front of my folks.

02:57.036 --> 02:58.701
You sure that's
what you want?

02:58.703 --> 03:00.538
Most definitely.

03:01.908 --> 03:03.441
I want my money.

03:06.178 --> 03:09.479
Well, you got
a real funny way of asking.

03:09.481 --> 03:10.917
Wasn't no question.

03:15.620 --> 03:18.655
What's that mean to you,
on your chest?

03:18.657 --> 03:20.559
What's
that mean to me?

03:21.560 --> 03:23.694
That means God is great

03:23.696 --> 03:26.431
'cause he continues
to forgive me,

03:30.770 --> 03:33.404
even though I'm the
biggest sinner there is.

03:33.406 --> 03:34.774
I don't believe that.

03:36.442 --> 03:38.776
You still going to church
every Sunday, ain't you?

03:38.778 --> 03:40.812
You used to be
over at New Birth,

03:40.814 --> 03:42.415
but now you're
at World Changers, huh?

03:43.918 --> 03:46.383
And your Aunt Cici
plays keys there.

03:46.385 --> 03:49.055
Going on six years
now, wow.

03:49.057 --> 03:50.856
Hmm. I wonder what
she'd think about you

03:50.858 --> 03:52.290
having a four-five
by your waist.

03:52.292 --> 03:54.292
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

03:54.294 --> 03:56.628
Also, word of advice. If you're
wearing an ankle monitor,

03:56.630 --> 03:58.098
you might not want
to carry a gun

03:58.100 --> 03:59.198
unless you want to do
another 10 years.

03:59.200 --> 04:00.567
That what you want?

04:01.435 --> 04:03.703
Huh?

04:03.705 --> 04:05.470
And I don't know what
your fake-fur-coat-wearing ass

04:05.472 --> 04:06.907
ain't doing at home.

04:06.909 --> 04:08.876
Now, your girl's
due any day now.

04:08.878 --> 04:10.543
Side chick about
to have a baby, too,

04:10.545 --> 04:12.246
if I'm not mistaken.

04:12.248 --> 04:14.514
Suggestion. Maybe when
you're at the hospital,

04:14.516 --> 04:16.084
you can put 'em both
in the same room.

04:16.086 --> 04:17.716
Spare you the
back-and-fucking-forth.

04:17.719 --> 04:19.358
Look at me when I'm
talking to you, Litty.

04:20.454 --> 04:21.855
God is great.

04:21.857 --> 04:24.490
God is powerful, yeah.

04:24.492 --> 04:26.560
But even more so,
God is all-knowing.

04:26.562 --> 04:28.829
And that is what
makes him scary as shit.

04:28.831 --> 04:30.199
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

04:33.169 --> 04:34.568
So I'mma ask you
one more time.

04:34.570 --> 04:36.105
Where's my motherfucking
money, Litty?

04:36.107 --> 04:38.208
I ain't playing with you.
Where's my money?

04:49.753 --> 04:51.619
Look, Priest,
you know I got you.

04:51.621 --> 04:54.089
You ain't got shit.
Literally.

04:54.091 --> 04:56.491
You're three months behind
on your mortgage payments,

04:56.493 --> 04:58.326
and I don't care how many
gangsters from Joyland

04:58.328 --> 05:01.097
you got with you. Ain't nobody
more gangster than a bank.

05:01.099 --> 05:03.531
Come on, Litty,
you're going broke.

05:03.533 --> 05:04.800
You and I both
know that, right?

05:04.802 --> 05:06.467
I mean, the diamonds
around your neck,

05:06.469 --> 05:07.468
- they're not even real.
- Come on, don't do that.

05:07.470 --> 05:09.940
Look, let me work it off.

05:09.942 --> 05:12.008
Look, you give me some
bricks, I can move 'em.

05:12.010 --> 05:13.910
You're being serious?

05:13.912 --> 05:15.411
You ain't sold shit since you
was trappin' at that car wash

05:15.413 --> 05:16.745
on G-Road.

05:16.747 --> 05:19.050
And you weren't
even good at that.

05:19.052 --> 05:22.786
You are a rapper.
Stay rapping.

05:22.788 --> 05:24.486
Go back out on the road,
get them commas up,

05:24.488 --> 05:26.690
bring me back that check.

05:26.692 --> 05:28.760
In the meantime,
I'mma take them keys.

05:30.462 --> 05:32.698
- My keys?
- My keys.

05:35.902 --> 05:37.367
Come on, now.

05:42.441 --> 05:44.044
I'll send somebody by
to pick it up.

05:45.611 --> 05:49.049
Yo, Priest. Priest.

05:59.492 --> 06:01.895
<i>I been working
these streets since I was 11.</i>

06:01.897 --> 06:03.761
<i>I been hustlin'
every day since.</i>

06:03.763 --> 06:06.032
<i>I gave people jobs
when there were no jobs.</i>

06:06.034 --> 06:08.101
<i>And I moved my operation
from my living room</i>

06:08.103 --> 06:09.601
<i>to an old garage.</i>

06:09.603 --> 06:11.871
<i>Now, I got operations
all over the city.</i>

06:11.873 --> 06:13.753
<i>Isn't that what the
American dream is all about?</i>

06:39.768 --> 06:42.568
<i>Welcome to Masq,
the livest strip club in ATL.</i>

06:42.570 --> 06:44.271
<i>Y'all want to see some ass?</i>

06:44.273 --> 06:46.673
<i>Well, we want to see
some motherfucking cash.</i>

06:46.675 --> 06:48.910
<i>Now let's turn this shit
all the way up.</i>

07:12.836 --> 07:14.904
Hey, yo. Yo, yo.

07:14.906 --> 07:16.705
What the fuck is wrong?
Give me the phone.

07:16.707 --> 07:18.074
Hand that shit over.
No fucking pictures.

07:18.076 --> 07:19.708
- I'm sorry.
- Give me the fucking phone!

07:19.710 --> 07:21.078
- I'm not playing with you!
- I didn't know.

07:21.080 --> 07:22.913
- I'm sorry.
- Give me the phone.

07:22.915 --> 07:24.447
I don't give a fuck about none
of that. Give me the phone.

07:24.449 --> 07:25.115
Chill, chill, chill.
You trippin', bruh.

07:25.117 --> 07:26.449
Calm down.

07:26.451 --> 07:28.250
This shit we doing
belongs on camera, bruh.

07:28.252 --> 07:30.219
You know what I'm saying?
This TMZ shit.

07:30.221 --> 07:32.188
It's Sno Patrol!

07:34.192 --> 07:36.192
We run these
motherfucking streets.

07:36.194 --> 07:38.428
We run these
motherfucking streets.

07:38.430 --> 07:40.364
Sno Patrol!

07:40.366 --> 07:41.467
Get out of here, man.

07:47.107 --> 07:49.740
Mmm. <i>Hola, mami,</i>
<i>despacito, despacito.</i>

07:49.742 --> 07:51.274
What's happening?

07:51.276 --> 07:53.013
Mmm. I don't speak
none of that.

07:54.447 --> 07:55.779
How about a dance?

07:55.781 --> 07:58.349
Aw, baby,
I'm not a dancer.

07:58.351 --> 08:01.086
But you're so cute,
I wish I was.

08:01.088 --> 08:03.653
I have to get
back to work.

08:40.828 --> 08:43.263
Hey. You good?

08:43.265 --> 08:45.365
I don't like you
with those guys.

08:45.367 --> 08:47.367
I don't need
a babysitter, <i>mi amore.</i>

08:47.369 --> 08:49.304
What you need is a bodyguard
when those mother...

08:51.573 --> 08:54.075
Or some tequila.

09:03.685 --> 09:05.352
What up, baby?

09:05.354 --> 09:07.889
Hey, baby, I didn't know
you were coming.

09:07.891 --> 09:10.058
I told him to come.
Hi, honey.

09:10.060 --> 09:12.626
- She said it was poppin'.
- Oh, it is.

09:12.628 --> 09:14.595
- Yeah?
- I need a re-up.

09:14.597 --> 09:16.764
Ooh. Cheers to that.

09:16.766 --> 09:18.435
Hold on, y'all.
I'll be right back.

09:20.037 --> 09:21.357
She's always
working, huh?

09:24.274 --> 09:26.707
Listen, she shouldn't
have to do this anymore.

09:26.709 --> 09:29.177
Too much shit goes on around
here that I need to be up on.

09:29.179 --> 09:31.613
She knows how to pull that
better than anybody.

09:31.615 --> 09:33.916
And, besides, she can
take care of herself.

09:33.918 --> 09:36.085
- Hey.
- I know she can.

09:36.087 --> 09:37.155
I just don't like it.

09:38.490 --> 09:39.956
I don't give a fuck

09:39.958 --> 09:42.126
how many yards this dude
ran for in his career.

09:42.128 --> 09:43.658
He don't run shit here.

09:43.660 --> 09:44.995
If there ain't a bottle
in his hand

09:44.997 --> 09:46.496
in the next five minutes,

09:46.498 --> 09:48.264
you need to get your
ass on out of here.

09:48.266 --> 09:50.266
I got it.

09:50.268 --> 09:52.401
How did it go with Litty?
You get our money?

09:52.403 --> 09:54.237
Even better.
I took his pride.

09:54.239 --> 09:55.805
How is that better?

09:55.807 --> 09:57.340
If you can hang something
over someone's head,

09:57.342 --> 09:59.642
they will always go
wherever you lead them.

09:59.644 --> 10:01.445
Litty'll do whatever the
fuck I want him to do,

10:01.447 --> 10:03.013
which is better than money.

10:03.015 --> 10:04.647
Yo, what it do?

10:04.649 --> 10:06.617
All drinks on Sno Patrol!

10:06.619 --> 10:08.887
- I see winter's come tonight.
- Yeah.

10:08.889 --> 10:11.923
I swear, the more money
this fucking Sno Patrol makes,

10:11.925 --> 10:13.091
the sloppier they get.

10:13.093 --> 10:14.725
It's a goddamn disgrace.

10:14.727 --> 10:16.727
- Yo, Priest, what up?
- What up?

10:16.729 --> 10:19.097
Come fuck with me!
Come have a shot!

10:19.099 --> 10:20.831
I'll make sure
I tell Q you said that.

10:20.833 --> 10:22.766
Please do.

10:22.768 --> 10:24.803
That boy Priest
in the building, man.

10:30.810 --> 10:32.844
Q, what's up, baby?

10:32.846 --> 10:34.613
What up, fool?
How you feeling?

10:34.615 --> 10:36.615
- How you been?
- I'm blessed, man. How you been?

10:36.617 --> 10:38.017
You know y'all looking like a
big bowl of rice up here now.

10:38.019 --> 10:40.185
Yeah, but you getting
your Sammy Davis Jr. on.

10:40.187 --> 10:41.954
- Hide all the white girls!
- Come on now,

10:41.956 --> 10:43.389
you know you wish
you had my hair.

10:43.391 --> 10:45.291
You just can't grow it no more.

10:45.293 --> 10:46.993
Hey, get my man
a drink of something.

10:46.995 --> 10:48.726
You know, speaking
of the white girls, man,

10:48.728 --> 10:50.829
y'all got the numbers in
the streets fucked up, man.

10:50.831 --> 10:52.331
Yes, sir.

10:52.333 --> 10:54.000
Niggas can't eat, man.
What's up with that?

10:54.002 --> 10:55.334
You know, man, I'm just trying
to keep my head above water,

10:55.336 --> 10:56.702
stay out the wave.

10:56.704 --> 10:58.170
Nah, you definitely
doing that, no?

10:58.172 --> 10:59.639
- Yes, sir.
- Blessings to you, man.

10:59.641 --> 11:01.074
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers to that.

11:01.076 --> 11:02.909
- I'll see you later on.
- You be safe, fool.

11:06.814 --> 11:07.681
I don't know why you let that
nigga Priest still breathe.

11:07.683 --> 11:09.549
What you mean, bro?

11:09.551 --> 11:12.285
Man, listen, Priest ain't
never done shit to us, bruh.

11:12.287 --> 11:15.122
I'm saying there's enough money
out here for everybody to eat.

11:15.124 --> 11:18.459
Fuck that. I'm hungry.
I'm gonna take his food.

11:20.195 --> 11:23.464
Man, all these
bitches in here,

11:23.466 --> 11:27.002
all this money we get,
and you talking about Priest.

11:27.004 --> 11:29.738
We on top of the world.
It's Sno Patrol, baby.

11:37.982 --> 11:39.215
Mmm-hmm.

11:40.750 --> 11:41.784
Fuck.

11:44.688 --> 11:46.257
Hey, yo, Dee.

11:47.625 --> 11:49.625
What's going on, boss?

11:49.627 --> 11:52.794
Juju's been drinking a little
too much tonight, man.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.296
Need you
to look over him.

11:54.298 --> 11:56.365
- All right.
- Let's get it.

11:56.367 --> 11:58.300
Juju.

11:58.302 --> 12:01.437
- What, you had one too many?
- I'm straight.

12:01.439 --> 12:03.805
All right, look, I'm in the
cut if you need me, a'ight?

12:03.807 --> 12:05.343
A'ight.

12:11.017 --> 12:12.417
- You good?
- Yeah.

12:13.719 --> 12:15.655
Hi. Thank you.

12:23.729 --> 12:24.730
- Mmm-mmm-mmm.
- What?

12:26.632 --> 12:28.099
They're cute.

12:28.101 --> 12:30.267
You remember when
we used to be just like that?

12:30.269 --> 12:32.070
Acting a fool
after the club.

12:32.072 --> 12:35.740
Everybody had to pitch in
to buy the same one bottle,

12:35.742 --> 12:39.544
going through a whole bunch of
club soda just to make it last.

12:39.546 --> 12:41.066
And I always said
I'd take care of you.

12:42.181 --> 12:44.217
- Okay?
- Okay.

12:46.453 --> 12:47.952
Come on.

12:47.954 --> 12:49.287
All right.

12:49.289 --> 12:51.090
You and Cynthia better
wait up for me now.

12:51.092 --> 12:52.192
All right.

12:55.329 --> 12:57.329
- I'll see you at the house.
- Okay, baby.

13:02.470 --> 13:04.470
Fuck out of here with your
skinny-jean-wearing ass.

13:06.474 --> 13:07.575
Yeah, walk, pussy.

13:10.812 --> 13:12.311
I'm not walking
away for my sake.

13:12.313 --> 13:13.614
I'm walking away for yours.

13:15.483 --> 13:17.751
What you say?

13:17.753 --> 13:20.419
Think them two bitches,
you got it going down?

13:20.421 --> 13:21.854
Your hos ain't shit.

13:21.856 --> 13:23.490
You ain't shit.

13:23.492 --> 13:25.627
Fuck
out of here, man.

13:28.664 --> 13:29.832
Nigga, I said go.

13:37.941 --> 13:39.642
Oh, my God, look!
They're fighting, y'all.

13:54.357 --> 13:55.726
Oh, my God!

13:58.596 --> 14:00.598
What the fuck are you doing?
Man, come on!

14:07.873 --> 14:09.538
Keep it covered. Keep it covered.
Look, listen to me.

14:09.540 --> 14:11.507
You call an ambulance.
You take her to Grady.

14:11.509 --> 14:13.109
They're gonna try and take
her to another hospital,

14:13.111 --> 14:14.911
but you make sure she goes
to Grady. Do you understand?

14:14.913 --> 14:16.412
It's the best trauma
center in Atlanta.

14:16.414 --> 14:17.783
Okay, here.

14:18.482 --> 14:20.249
Don't worry.

14:20.251 --> 14:22.053
What? Come back.

14:48.080 --> 14:50.616
<i>All the power in the
world never stopped a bullet.</i>

14:52.986 --> 14:55.719
<i>And no car can outrun fate.</i>

15:29.290 --> 15:32.225
<i>I worked so hard
for what I got,</i>

15:32.227 --> 15:33.726
<i>and it could
all be taken away</i>

15:33.728 --> 15:35.795
<i>for the stupidest shit
you could think of.</i>

15:43.404 --> 15:45.884
<i>And this ain't the first
time I've been shot at, but...</i>

15:47.810 --> 15:49.178
<i>It's got to be the last.</i>

16:27.151 --> 16:30.954
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

16:30.956 --> 16:32.655
What up, boy?

16:32.657 --> 16:34.323
- Yo, what up, man?
- Hey, Priest.

16:34.325 --> 16:35.691
How you doing,
Monique? You all right?

16:35.693 --> 16:37.060
Yeah. Get up, baby.

16:37.062 --> 16:38.527
You know I've
been calling y'all.

16:38.529 --> 16:41.463
Yeah, no cell phones, man.
Sorry about that shit.

16:41.465 --> 16:43.867
Hey, now that you're here, let
me get at you about something.

16:43.869 --> 16:45.234
- Okay. Later.
- A'ight.

16:45.236 --> 16:47.038
Yo, Priest.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.538
You got my word, Freddie.

16:48.540 --> 16:50.574
- A'ight?
- A'ight.

16:50.576 --> 16:52.275
- Where's Eddie?
- He's over there.

16:52.277 --> 16:55.013
Shake 'em up,
shake 'em up, shake 'em.

16:55.015 --> 16:57.681
Come on, I'm telling you,
it's gonna keep happening.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.083
Come on, come on, come on.

16:59.085 --> 17:01.585
Put your money down, baby.
Put your money down.

17:01.587 --> 17:03.286
Hold it, hold it.

17:03.288 --> 17:05.122
Bet, bet. Put your money down, baby.
Come on.

17:05.124 --> 17:06.844
Let's play for
some real money, baby.

17:08.226 --> 17:09.895
What's wrong? You ain't
got your weight up?

17:09.896 --> 17:13.464
Nigga, my money longer than
Peachtree, you dig? Mmm-hmm.

17:13.465 --> 17:15.232
Well, ain't no reason for
you to wait on the weight.

17:15.233 --> 17:17.300
That's a swift eight ounces
of coke right there, baby.

17:17.303 --> 17:18.938
Let's do it. Let's do it!

17:18.940 --> 17:20.605
Put your money up.
This ain't just luck, brother.

17:20.607 --> 17:22.674
I'm telling you.
This must be from God, baby.

17:22.675 --> 17:25.044
Don't mind if I do.
For good luck.

17:25.046 --> 17:26.878
Motherfucker!

17:26.881 --> 17:29.548
- God damn, man!
- Lucky leprechaun motherfucker.

17:29.550 --> 17:31.450
Beautiful.
I appreciate you.

17:31.452 --> 17:34.252
What y'all waiting on? Throw
it in the pot like gumbo.

17:34.254 --> 17:35.854
Pay the man.

17:35.856 --> 17:37.255
- Eddie.
- Yup.

17:37.257 --> 17:38.757
We need to talk.

17:38.759 --> 17:41.593
- Right now?
- Yeah, now would be nice.

17:41.595 --> 17:43.528
Like, I'm winning
this shit while these...

17:43.530 --> 17:45.767
All right.

17:47.802 --> 17:49.802
A'ight, y'all, look.

17:49.804 --> 17:51.704
All right, y'all will get y'all
shot at the king next week.

17:51.706 --> 17:54.975
But until then, if you would,
cash my chips out, thank you.

17:54.977 --> 17:56.843
Hold up,
hold up, hold up.

17:56.845 --> 18:00.748
Where the hell your pretty
ass think you taking him?

18:00.750 --> 18:02.984
It ain't none of your damn
business where I'm taking him.

18:02.986 --> 18:04.953
The hell it ain't
my business, bruh.

18:04.955 --> 18:06.587
You ain't gonna just walk your
man out of here like that

18:06.589 --> 18:08.923
and not give me a chance
to win back my money, nigga.

18:08.925 --> 18:11.425
Perm-fade-wearing
motherfucker!

18:11.427 --> 18:14.528
Watch your motherfucking mouth, nigga.

18:14.530 --> 18:16.032
- Oh, hell no!
- Take it easy, take it easy.

18:16.034 --> 18:17.665
Just keep it cool.

18:17.667 --> 18:19.167
The game ain't the only thing
that got to end tonight.

18:19.169 --> 18:21.003
- You see what I'm saying?
- Be cool.

18:21.005 --> 18:22.336
- You got it, kinfolk.
- Yeah, I know I got it.

18:22.338 --> 18:23.339
Let's go.

18:24.841 --> 18:26.342
Hey, cash my
chips out, too.

18:28.612 --> 18:30.079
I don't know
how many times

18:30.081 --> 18:31.613
I got to tell you this, man.
Fuck the Sno Patrol!

18:31.615 --> 18:33.848
Seriously, man.
A bunch of grown-ass men

18:33.850 --> 18:36.251
who dressing like they
deserve to all be shot.

18:36.253 --> 18:38.353
I'm not going to war
with Sno Patrol.

18:38.355 --> 18:41.589
But Juju don't get
a fucking pass.

18:41.591 --> 18:44.094
- So how you wanna do it?
- We're not doing anything.

18:44.096 --> 18:45.828
It doesn't matter
how smart you are

18:45.830 --> 18:47.697
in a world of stupid
motherfuckers

18:47.699 --> 18:50.533
that'll shoot at you
over some petty shit.

18:50.535 --> 18:51.935
What are
you talking about?

18:51.937 --> 18:53.937
Listen
to what I'm saying.

18:53.939 --> 18:55.337
We have been operating without
the police knowing about us,

18:55.339 --> 18:57.008
feds knowing about us,
under the radar.

18:57.010 --> 18:58.741
All of that shit's
about to change.

18:58.743 --> 19:00.743
A fucking girl
was shot last night, Eddie.

19:00.745 --> 19:02.511
It's a miracle
she survived.

19:02.513 --> 19:03.915
The city's gonna
be all over it.

19:03.917 --> 19:05.682
Sno Patrol's about
to clap back at us.

19:05.684 --> 19:07.416
Think about it, now.

19:07.418 --> 19:09.318
Everybody who's been at
the top of the game been got.

19:09.320 --> 19:11.688
Right? They end up dead
or in jail almost always

19:11.690 --> 19:14.725
because of their ego, wanting
more than they should want.

19:14.727 --> 19:16.560
Everybody wants
to be great, nigga.

19:16.562 --> 19:18.797
Everybody wants to be superfly.
They want to be us.

19:20.332 --> 19:21.766
But it's fucking
time, nigga.

19:21.768 --> 19:24.168
You dance with
the devil long enough...

19:24.170 --> 19:26.503
He's bound
to step on your feet.

19:26.505 --> 19:27.973
You sound like
that fucking bullet hit you

19:27.975 --> 19:29.209
in your fucking head.

19:31.243 --> 19:32.710
All right, look,
all our years,

19:32.712 --> 19:34.679
we never had to body anyone,
Eddie. Why is that?

19:34.681 --> 19:36.149
Because when they think
you gonna do it,

19:36.151 --> 19:37.682
you don't have to.
It's leverage.

19:37.684 --> 19:40.685
No, it's 'cause bodies
leave a stink on you.

19:40.687 --> 19:42.386
Not talking about a stink
that bring no police.

19:42.388 --> 19:44.891
I'm talking about a stink
that you can never shake.

19:44.893 --> 19:46.725
A stink that will
bring you down.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.259
I get it, Priest.
You don't have

19:48.261 --> 19:49.828
to fucking preach to me, okay?
It's not Sunday.

19:49.830 --> 19:51.396
If you get it, then you
hear what I'm saying.

19:51.398 --> 19:52.767
I want out
the cocaine business.

19:57.172 --> 19:59.571
You just emotional.

19:59.573 --> 20:01.306
I get it.
You almost got got.

20:01.308 --> 20:03.642
But the game has
been good to us.

20:03.644 --> 20:05.880
- Man, we ain't leaving nothing.
- Not yet.

20:05.882 --> 20:07.182
A'ight.

20:08.151 --> 20:10.416
One last deal.

20:10.418 --> 20:13.120
One last score so big
that we will never have

20:13.122 --> 20:15.455
to look over our shoulder again.
Not for no cop,

20:15.457 --> 20:17.325
not for no crook,
not for nobody.

20:19.728 --> 20:21.262
Man, how long you been
thinking about this shit?

20:21.264 --> 20:23.230
'Cause you don't just
think about ideas.

20:23.232 --> 20:26.169
Look, I've always had
an exit plan, Eddie. Always.

20:29.172 --> 20:30.604
We have got
to do this shit

20:30.606 --> 20:33.774
before I fucking
kill somebody, Eddie,

20:33.776 --> 20:35.478
or a motherfucker
kills me.

20:38.815 --> 20:40.815
I'mma talk to Scatter.

20:40.817 --> 20:42.919
I'mma have him
turn the faucet on blast.

20:42.921 --> 20:44.786
And I'll ask him
to up our supply.

20:44.788 --> 20:46.989
What?

20:46.991 --> 20:48.723
You know, that sound
like a fucking joke.

20:48.725 --> 20:51.160
We got a better chance
robbing a fucking bank.

20:51.162 --> 20:53.932
He will do it for me.
We got real history.

20:56.100 --> 20:57.900
So, are you in?

20:57.902 --> 20:59.601
Priest, you're
my fucking brother.

20:59.603 --> 21:02.307
Tell me that you're in.

21:04.944 --> 21:06.045
I got you.

21:14.286 --> 21:17.056
Weight on the shoulder,
hips down.

21:22.360 --> 21:25.363
A'ight. That's it
for today, class.

21:29.367 --> 21:31.237
Scatter, school's
getting bigger.

21:32.138 --> 21:33.372
Lot of students.

21:35.507 --> 21:38.442
It's a real legitimate
business, wow.

21:38.444 --> 21:40.510
It's not just
a front anymore.

21:40.512 --> 21:43.148
Just like that art gallery
you bought your girl.

21:43.150 --> 21:44.681
Not even a year later,

21:44.683 --> 21:47.052
and you rubbing elbows
with Atlanta's upper echelon,

21:47.054 --> 21:49.721
hanging out with
the penthouse crew.

21:51.558 --> 21:53.125
That's a smart move for you.

21:53.127 --> 21:55.193
Smart move for both
of us. Come on, now.

21:55.195 --> 21:56.728
It's not easy
being a dope dealer

21:56.730 --> 21:57.731
without looking like one.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.832
Glove up.

22:00.834 --> 22:02.667
Nah, I'm not trying to do all
that. I came down here...

22:02.669 --> 22:04.704
When do you come to my
gym and not glove up?

22:08.242 --> 22:10.276
I know you miss your favorite student.
Just say it.

22:10.278 --> 22:12.211
Yeah, I miss
kicking your ass.

22:12.213 --> 22:13.581
Now you about to get it.

22:21.290 --> 22:23.392
- You sure?
- Oh, yeah.

22:24.860 --> 22:26.192
I want to talk to you
about something.

22:26.194 --> 22:27.428
So talk.

22:28.965 --> 22:30.498
I want to up our supply.

22:32.801 --> 22:34.770
- For what?
- There's more to be had.

22:39.608 --> 22:42.776
We good with
what we got. So why?

22:42.778 --> 22:44.178
I understand the way
we've been doing things.

22:44.180 --> 22:46.048
All right, I do,
but we're missing

22:46.050 --> 22:47.415
a lot of opportunity
on the street.

22:47.417 --> 22:48.849
You know what I'm saying?

22:48.851 --> 22:50.331
We're just leaving
money on the table.

23:00.297 --> 23:02.763
What color belt
am I in jiu-jitsu?

23:02.765 --> 23:05.969
- Black.
- That's right.

23:05.971 --> 23:07.937
You ain't never see me
wear no belt, do you?

23:07.939 --> 23:10.572
And if it is, it's brown.
You want to know why?

23:10.574 --> 23:13.344
'Cause people respect me,
but they leave me be.

23:14.244 --> 23:15.744
They see black,

23:15.746 --> 23:17.813
and motherfuckers
start asking questions.

23:17.815 --> 23:19.683
They might even be
fool enough to test me.

23:21.953 --> 23:24.454
We leave money on the table
so we don't get caught.

23:24.456 --> 23:26.416
But if you see an opportunity,
you got to take it.

23:30.762 --> 23:33.196
Sometimes the opportunity
ain't what it looks like.

23:33.198 --> 23:34.630
You ever hear that saying,

23:34.632 --> 23:36.000
"If it's too good to be true,
it probably is"?

23:36.002 --> 23:37.169
Maybe we're just that good.

23:40.973 --> 23:42.174
You ain't that good.

23:46.511 --> 23:48.445
And the answer's no.

23:48.447 --> 23:49.883
I'm not upping
your supply.

23:58.492 --> 23:59.991
I don't get it, Q.

23:59.993 --> 24:02.094
You owe me $50,000.

24:02.096 --> 24:03.660
I had to pay
that girl you shot,

24:03.662 --> 24:05.662
her and her friends,
to keep they mouth shut.

24:05.664 --> 24:07.033
You know if I would've
knew that shit,

24:07.035 --> 24:08.134
I would've paid
them hos a visit.

24:08.136 --> 24:09.834
A visit?

24:09.836 --> 24:11.636
- Nah, the cash work every time.
- Let me guess.

24:11.638 --> 24:13.238
You want to pay this nigga
Priest in gold, right?

24:13.240 --> 24:15.107
Priest? You still
on that shit?

24:15.109 --> 24:16.808
- I told you to drop that.
- What the fuck would you do

24:16.810 --> 24:18.710
- if a nigga put his hands on you, Q?
- The fuck you mean?

24:18.712 --> 24:20.832
I would've whacked that bitch!
But that's me, not you!

24:22.216 --> 24:24.385
You need to let that shit go.
You fucking up my money.

24:40.402 --> 24:41.801
Damn!

24:41.803 --> 24:43.503
Fuck y'all
talking about, man?

24:43.505 --> 24:45.006
Man, Dee talking about
how he could whup Mike Tyson.

24:45.008 --> 24:47.340
Man, give the man
the whole story.

24:47.342 --> 24:49.342
I ain't talking
about Iron Mike.

24:49.344 --> 24:51.812
I'm talking about right now,
Old-and-Fat Mike.

24:51.814 --> 24:54.481
Bro, you could probably whup
his ass, too. Why you playing?

24:54.483 --> 24:56.316
Not even with a baseball bat.

24:56.318 --> 24:58.052
Nah, my nigga.
Nah, nah.

24:58.054 --> 24:59.387
I don't know about that, bro.
Mike's still Mike.

24:59.389 --> 25:00.821
He put them hands on you,
it's over with.

25:00.823 --> 25:02.090
Bro, have you seen me
in a gym lately?

25:02.092 --> 25:03.332
Yeah, nigga,
that's the problem.

25:05.895 --> 25:07.694
Let me show you this combo
I've been working on.

25:07.696 --> 25:08.997
It's for you, too. Bro,
you know what I'm saying?

25:08.999 --> 25:10.298
I don't do
all that kung fu shit.

25:10.300 --> 25:11.580
I'm a real man,
you feel me? I...

25:24.049 --> 25:25.982
Oh, shit!

25:25.984 --> 25:28.528
- Get these motherfuckers, man!
- Get them bitches!

25:32.790 --> 25:35.224
Whoo!

25:35.226 --> 25:37.529
Let's go. Let's get
the fuck out of here.

25:48.107 --> 25:50.740
He'd been driving
10 hours straight.

25:50.742 --> 25:53.576
Who the fuck does that?
Is this nigga ever gonna stop?

25:53.578 --> 25:57.313
Don't get too close, now.
Stay, like, a few cars back.

25:57.315 --> 25:58.983
Why are we
doing this?

25:58.985 --> 26:01.385
How do you even know Scatter's
going to meet his supplier?

26:01.387 --> 26:02.785
I just know shit.

26:02.787 --> 26:04.555
How 'bout that?

26:04.557 --> 26:06.557
I would never
go around you, Priest.

26:06.559 --> 26:08.325
You think Scatter's
gonna be okay with you

26:08.327 --> 26:10.095
going around him
to get to his connect?

26:10.097 --> 26:11.395
He's
never gonna know.

26:11.397 --> 26:12.796
Man, I need to sleep.

26:12.798 --> 26:14.599
I need to sleep,
but you keep yelling.

26:14.601 --> 26:16.537
Could you just shut up,
please, and keep driving?

27:03.686 --> 27:06.488
- Is that Scatter's plug?
- Yep.

27:09.525 --> 27:11.325
Now, you see that
guy there in the hat?

27:11.327 --> 27:13.827
- That's the head of the cartel.
- How you know?

27:13.829 --> 27:15.932
- The song.
- What are you talking about?

27:17.100 --> 27:18.865
It's a narcocorrido.

27:18.867 --> 27:21.735
Ballads that tell stories
of real-life drug kingpins,

27:21.737 --> 27:24.539
and this one in particular was
about the Gonzalez brothers.

27:24.541 --> 27:26.941
And that's Adalberto.
He's one of 'em.

27:26.943 --> 27:28.842
You would know
some shit like that.

27:28.844 --> 27:31.512
You say brothers.
I see one,

27:31.514 --> 27:32.716
but where's the other one?

27:37.254 --> 27:38.694
What do you think
they talking about?

27:39.423 --> 27:40.658
Drugs, nigga.

27:57.943 --> 27:59.208
You up now?

27:59.210 --> 28:01.446
Negative.

28:13.760 --> 28:15.792
Oh, hell no.

28:15.794 --> 28:17.827
See, going around Scatter
is already enough,

28:17.829 --> 28:19.730
but I'm not going
into Mexico.

28:19.732 --> 28:22.566
Texas is where I draw the line.
I am a domestic nigga.

28:22.568 --> 28:25.603
- I need to stay on this side.
- But we gotta go to the source.

28:25.605 --> 28:27.004
All right?
This is our chance.

28:27.006 --> 28:29.007
No, that's Juarez
on the other side.

28:29.009 --> 28:32.243
I don't want to go nowhere
where the J's is silent.

28:32.245 --> 28:34.780
I need to be able to hear
the J's. I like J's.

28:34.782 --> 28:36.782
If you don't want to go,
you can walk back.

28:36.784 --> 28:39.450
Come on, now, we gotta
do what we gotta do.

28:54.335 --> 28:55.902
They're gonna see us,

28:55.904 --> 28:57.603
and then they're gonna bury us
in the fucking desert.

28:57.605 --> 28:58.905
No, they won't.

28:58.907 --> 29:00.305
Did the song
tell you that, too?

29:00.307 --> 29:02.240
No, the song didn't tell me.
I just know shit.

29:02.242 --> 29:03.443
How 'bout that?

29:03.445 --> 29:05.144
At least tell me
that we have a plan.

29:05.146 --> 29:06.214
We have a plan.

29:08.249 --> 29:09.249
Sort of.

29:26.335 --> 29:27.737
Mexico.

29:52.729 --> 29:54.796
He's turning. Turn.
Turn to the right.

29:54.798 --> 29:55.933
I got it, I got it.

30:09.013 --> 30:10.248
Yo, keep the engine running.

31:10.444 --> 31:11.779
Come on.

31:21.891 --> 31:23.257
<i>Senor</i> Gonzalez.

31:26.995 --> 31:28.563
I know who you are, Priest.

31:30.332 --> 31:32.234
I know everyone
who sells my product.

31:33.201 --> 31:34.970
There are layers

31:34.972 --> 31:38.438
between people like you
and people like me.

31:39.842 --> 31:41.376
Scatter is like
a brother to me.

31:42.511 --> 31:43.713
Your boss.

31:48.150 --> 31:50.186
What the fuck
is up with that?

31:58.594 --> 32:01.462
If you know who I am,
then you know,

32:01.464 --> 32:05.166
in all my years, I've never
once been arrested, not once.

32:05.168 --> 32:07.469
The only record I have is a
juvenile one, and it's sealed.

32:07.471 --> 32:10.006
Now, I've made this risk

32:10.008 --> 32:12.841
'cause although I'm careful,
I'm very ambitious.

32:12.843 --> 32:14.509
Scatter's trying to put
a ceiling over my head,

32:14.511 --> 32:16.344
but I can go much
higher than that.

32:16.346 --> 32:19.050
- And why do I care?
- You care because your mother.

32:27.058 --> 32:29.091
I meant
no disrespect.

32:29.093 --> 32:31.396
No, please elaborate.

32:33.231 --> 32:35.533
They're playing well
this year. Guanajuato.

32:37.037 --> 32:39.569
So far. Are you a fan?

32:39.571 --> 32:41.472
More like a student
of the game.

32:42.107 --> 32:43.774
Really?

32:43.776 --> 32:46.510
And what a season
El Blanco is having! Wow.

32:46.512 --> 32:47.946
Yeah, he's the best.

32:47.948 --> 32:49.413
The best scorer
probably in the league,

32:49.415 --> 32:51.081
but not the best
player on the team.

32:51.083 --> 32:52.716
No, that would be Rafa.

32:52.718 --> 32:54.118
See, Rafa's the defender,

32:54.120 --> 32:56.120
the backbone of the team,

32:56.122 --> 32:58.057
but never scores any goals, so
nobody ever talks about him.

32:58.059 --> 33:00.993
Nobody appreciates him.

33:00.995 --> 33:02.359
El Blanco
may get all the glory,

33:02.361 --> 33:05.329
but he's nothing
without Rafa.

33:05.331 --> 33:07.699
Your mother, queen
of the Gonzalez cartel,

33:07.701 --> 33:10.368
she favors your brother
over you, doesn't she?

33:10.370 --> 33:12.037
What's his name? Augustin?

33:12.039 --> 33:13.439
Oh...

33:19.113 --> 33:22.082
What the fuck do you know
about my family?

33:22.084 --> 33:25.751
So you read Mexican
tabloids, like a housewife?

33:25.753 --> 33:27.622
Where did you
get this one from?

33:28.556 --> 33:30.591
<i>Metro? La Prensa?</i>

33:32.460 --> 33:34.095
<i>Leavenworth Times!</i>

33:34.097 --> 33:36.129
- What?
- That's where I got it from.

33:36.131 --> 33:37.765
I got people
in prison, too.

33:44.740 --> 33:46.506
I'm not your average dope boy, Mr.
Gonzalez.

33:46.508 --> 33:48.209
Don't let the pretty
hair fool you.

33:49.276 --> 33:51.144
I got eyes everywhere.

33:51.146 --> 33:52.445
And?

33:52.447 --> 33:54.748
Information is power.

33:54.750 --> 33:57.019
And power is priceless.
You know that.

33:57.021 --> 33:58.852
What else do you know?

33:58.854 --> 34:00.286
I know that your mother

34:00.288 --> 34:01.957
sees the volume
Augustin's bringing in,

34:01.959 --> 34:03.590
and she thinks
it's 'cause he's bold.

34:03.592 --> 34:06.594
I think it's
'cause he's sloppy.

34:06.596 --> 34:08.929
That's why he's
in Leavenworth right now.

34:08.931 --> 34:11.933
'Cause unlike you, he's messy.
He talks too much.

34:11.935 --> 34:13.935
How else you think I know
all your family business?

34:18.641 --> 34:20.341
So
you're suggesting

34:20.342 --> 34:23.444
that you can distribute
a much higher volume for me

34:23.446 --> 34:26.614
and maintain my relatively
limited exposure?

34:26.617 --> 34:30.184
I wouldn't gamble my life
for no suggestion, now.

34:30.186 --> 34:33.357
Mr. Gonzalez,
allow me to be

34:34.391 --> 34:35.391
your glory.

34:37.828 --> 34:39.098
Thank you.

34:40.797 --> 34:42.799
I'm gonna give you
triple the supply

34:42.801 --> 34:45.702
I was providing Scatter,
to start with.

34:45.704 --> 34:47.335
Sounds good.

34:47.337 --> 34:49.841
But I'm not gonna front it
to you. You'll pay me.

34:52.143 --> 34:53.277
Not a problem.

35:15.868 --> 35:18.669
What the fuck
did they do to your hair?

35:18.671 --> 35:21.405
Oh, boy, I thought I
wasn't gonna see you.

35:21.407 --> 35:23.307
We got motherfucking
work to do now.

35:23.309 --> 35:24.443
You're driving.

35:57.812 --> 35:59.645
<i>Where the hell you been?</i>

35:59.647 --> 36:01.115
<i>Out with friends.</i>

36:01.117 --> 36:02.314
<i>What friends?</i>

36:02.316 --> 36:03.885
<i>Friends like Scatter?</i>

36:03.887 --> 36:05.451
<i>What did I tell you
about him, boy?</i>

36:05.453 --> 36:06.888
<i>You stay around him,
and you'll wind up</i>

36:06.890 --> 36:08.890
<i>in county or in a coffin.</i>

36:08.892 --> 36:11.025
<i>It's because of Scatter
that we pay our bills.</i>

36:11.027 --> 36:13.260
<i>It's because of him
that we can keep this house.</i>

36:13.262 --> 36:14.896
<i>If keeping this house means</i>

36:14.898 --> 36:18.298
<i>you working for that man,
I don't need this damn place!</i>

36:18.300 --> 36:20.534
<i>Get your things and get out!</i>

36:20.536 --> 36:22.602
<i>Mama,
will you just listen, please?</i>

36:22.604 --> 36:24.940
<i>You told me
you'd stop working for Scatter.</i>

36:24.942 --> 36:26.975
<i>- You lied to me!
- I'm doing all of this for you!</i>

36:26.977 --> 36:28.977
<i>Why don't you get that?</i>

36:28.979 --> 36:30.611
<i>Don't give me that.
You're doing it for yourself.</i>

36:30.613 --> 36:32.314
<i>Mama, please, stop!</i>

37:11.189 --> 37:13.525
Hey. Thanks
for finally selling.

37:15.260 --> 37:16.793
It was time for a change.

37:33.881 --> 37:36.014
No shit.

37:36.016 --> 37:38.417
- What is it?
- Sno Patrol got hit.

37:50.731 --> 37:53.398
- I need a all-white casket.
- Of course.

37:53.400 --> 37:54.601
Whatever the family...

37:57.170 --> 37:59.171
Whatever you want.

37:59.173 --> 38:02.208
I want gold handles,
real gold.

38:02.210 --> 38:03.541
Anything different,

38:03.543 --> 38:05.183
your ass gonna be
in one of these caskets.

38:09.183 --> 38:10.884
Of course.

38:10.886 --> 38:13.319
We always do right
by our people, man.

38:13.321 --> 38:15.088
Got to.

38:15.090 --> 38:17.024
We might as well pick out
one for Priest while we here.

38:17.026 --> 38:18.591
- Priest?
- Yeah, Priest.

38:18.593 --> 38:20.826
I'mma handle that nigga.
Don't even worry about it.

38:20.828 --> 38:22.695
What make you so sure
Priest did this?

38:22.697 --> 38:24.398
You ain't seen shit.

38:24.400 --> 38:26.000
We ain't got no word
from the streets yet...

38:26.002 --> 38:27.902
Q, fuck the word
on the street.

38:27.904 --> 38:29.602
Me and him tussle. Now this shit?
Who else you think did this shit?

38:29.604 --> 38:31.072
That ain't Priest's style.

38:31.074 --> 38:32.874
I don't give a fuck
about his style, Q.

38:32.876 --> 38:34.741
- He did it! I'm trying to tell you!
- Hold on, man.

38:34.743 --> 38:36.344
Take some of that motherfucking
bass out your voice!

38:36.346 --> 38:38.445
Fuck wrong with you?

38:38.447 --> 38:39.914
Take care of Miss Mary! That's all
you need to be worried about!

38:39.916 --> 38:41.116
You hear me?

38:41.118 --> 38:42.185
Get, nigga!

38:45.388 --> 38:46.488
A'ight, Q.

39:03.341 --> 39:05.075
Damn, boy! You know
they killed Bin Laden

39:05.077 --> 39:06.317
with one of these
motherfuckers?

39:11.449 --> 39:13.484
Must've been all
that was left of his ass.

39:14.987 --> 39:16.585
Hold on.

39:16.587 --> 39:18.989
Let's hang up
another victim.

39:18.991 --> 39:21.160
I swear I'mma start
naming these motherfuckers.

39:22.995 --> 39:24.695
I need to ask you
something, Eddie.

39:30.634 --> 39:32.736
I did it.

39:32.738 --> 39:35.072
I didn't pull the trigger, but I
definitely pushed the button.

39:35.074 --> 39:36.608
Fat Freddie got it done.

39:38.311 --> 39:39.977
I thought I made
myself clear, Eddie.

39:39.979 --> 39:41.811
What the fuck do you mean,
you made yourself clear?

39:41.813 --> 39:44.547
- I said leave them alone.
- I thought we were partners.

39:44.549 --> 39:46.185
I get a say-so
in this shit, too.

39:49.222 --> 39:50.223
The fuck?

39:54.660 --> 39:56.461
You're my brother, Priest.

39:56.463 --> 39:58.229
Somebody come at my brother.
They come at me.

39:58.231 --> 40:00.899
If they come at me,
they get got.

40:00.901 --> 40:03.235
- You started a war.
- No, I didn't.

40:03.237 --> 40:05.636
They was gonna come
for you regardless.

40:05.638 --> 40:07.705
Fuck Sno Patrol! You
said that shit yourself.

40:07.707 --> 40:09.008
We gonna be long
gone by the time

40:09.010 --> 40:11.309
they're an issue
for us anyway, trust me.

40:11.311 --> 40:14.047
That's the problem, Eddie.
That's the fucking problem.

40:14.049 --> 40:16.348
We are supposed to trust
each other. Are we not?

40:16.350 --> 40:18.752
You don't always have to tell me the truth.
That's not trust.

40:19.820 --> 40:21.187
Me doing right by you,

40:21.189 --> 40:22.687
you doing right by me.
That's trust!

40:22.689 --> 40:24.257
Haven't I always
done right by you?

40:24.259 --> 40:26.392
Whatever, nigga. Just don't
fucking lie to me again.

40:26.394 --> 40:28.062
- I'm serious.
- A'ight.

40:28.064 --> 40:30.030
I don't care what your
definition of trust is, either.

40:30.032 --> 40:31.112
Mmm. You want
to hug it out?

40:32.233 --> 40:33.833
Huh? I'm right here.

40:33.835 --> 40:34.836
Hug this.

40:42.244 --> 40:45.446
God, give me the strength
to lead these people

40:45.448 --> 40:48.781
to righteousness,
to prosperity,

40:48.783 --> 40:50.551
and to a better city.

40:50.553 --> 40:52.352
God, give these good people

40:52.354 --> 40:54.421
the strength to make
the right decision

40:54.423 --> 40:59.027
at the voting booth next month,
for themselves, their family,

40:59.029 --> 41:01.728
and for the blessed
city of Atlanta.

41:01.730 --> 41:02.933
God bless you.

41:04.201 --> 41:05.866
God bless ATL.

41:05.868 --> 41:07.237
Thank you.

41:13.810 --> 41:16.744
Georgia, my goodness,
look at this turnout.

41:16.746 --> 41:19.415
Well, you have a ton
of supporters, Your Honor.

41:19.417 --> 41:22.118
That I may, but not normally
amongst this crowd.

41:22.120 --> 41:23.718
Come work with me already.

41:23.720 --> 41:26.255
I already
work for you, sir.

41:26.257 --> 41:29.425
You are single-handedly
expanding my base.

41:29.427 --> 41:32.294
In the words of Christ
himself, "I have other sheep

41:32.296 --> 41:33.796
"that are not of this pen.

41:33.798 --> 41:35.698
"But I need these also."

41:35.700 --> 41:38.300
And you, my dear,
know all the cool sheep.

41:38.302 --> 41:39.471
Yes, I do.

41:41.440 --> 41:43.509
Wow. Powerful,
isn't it?

41:44.443 --> 41:47.179
It is beautiful.

41:50.016 --> 41:52.315
You know he paints murals
as well, this guy,

41:52.317 --> 41:53.583
out on the streets?

41:53.585 --> 41:55.652
He's known to use
found materials.

41:55.654 --> 41:58.422
Well, some of my favorite
artists use found materials.

41:58.424 --> 42:01.361
I feel it brings a sense
of reality to the work.

42:02.629 --> 42:05.130
Yeah. Of course.

42:05.132 --> 42:07.032
Turning trash into millions.

42:07.034 --> 42:08.832
Mmm. Artists are hustlers.

42:08.834 --> 42:10.994
And everyone loves a hustler,
don't they, Mayor Atkins?

42:12.205 --> 42:13.306
They just can't help it.

42:17.645 --> 42:19.945
Why don't you
show me another piece?

42:19.947 --> 42:22.316
What's wrong
with this piece?

42:22.983 --> 42:24.118
Nothing.

42:25.352 --> 42:26.585
Good.

42:26.587 --> 42:28.253
Because you
just bought it.

42:28.255 --> 42:29.754
- Did I?
- Yes.

42:29.756 --> 42:31.423
How much did I spend?

42:33.094 --> 42:34.974
- I'll talk to you in a minute.
- Okay.

42:38.466 --> 42:40.133
- Hi.
- Hi.

42:40.135 --> 42:42.635
- Thank you. You look so good.
- You look good.

42:42.637 --> 42:43.704
How you doing?

42:45.839 --> 42:48.675
If you left me in a
roach-infested trap house,

42:48.677 --> 42:51.145
I wouldn't feel nearly as
dirty as I do right now

42:51.147 --> 42:52.579
next to His Honor.

42:52.581 --> 42:53.813
Oh, my God, is that
a bathing suit under there?

42:53.815 --> 42:55.415
Baby,
I'm sorry,

42:55.417 --> 42:57.217
- but you've got to stay close to him.
- Why?

42:57.219 --> 43:00.654
- What's the play here?
- There's no play right now.

43:00.656 --> 43:01.936
That's something
for a rainy day.

43:02.925 --> 43:04.227
I got to make a call.

43:13.669 --> 43:14.903
<i>Yo,
are they there yet?</i>

43:14.905 --> 43:17.872
No, not yet.

43:17.874 --> 43:20.341
We have an exhibition
at the San Francisco MOMA

43:20.343 --> 43:21.977
opening next week.

43:21.979 --> 43:23.545
- Okay.
- And I thought it'd be dope

43:23.547 --> 43:25.413
- to do something here, too.
- Are you kidding me?

43:25.415 --> 43:27.048
I would love that. That would
be absolutely amazing.

43:27.050 --> 43:28.416
- Good seeing you.
- Good to see you.

43:28.418 --> 43:30.585
- Take care. Hey.
- I will.

43:30.587 --> 43:32.420
- 'Sup?
- You got to go.

43:32.422 --> 43:33.624
Let me call you back.

43:35.359 --> 43:37.525
This look like a mixtape
release party to you, nigga?

43:37.527 --> 43:38.928
It ain't that
kind of event.

43:38.930 --> 43:40.228
- Bitch, go do your job.
- "Bitch"?

43:40.230 --> 43:41.664
Look,
I got this, baby.

43:41.666 --> 43:43.065
Let's chop it up
downstairs real quick.

43:43.067 --> 43:44.707
I got it, baby. Go on and mingle.
Come on.

43:48.172 --> 43:49.307
So what's
going on, man?

43:52.210 --> 43:54.710
$23,000 for this shit?

43:54.712 --> 43:56.445
She got a better
hustle than we do.

43:56.447 --> 43:57.815
Yeah, she's got
an eye for it.

43:59.450 --> 44:01.217
Funny you should say that.

44:01.219 --> 44:02.953
I lost an eye
the other day.

44:02.955 --> 44:05.489
Yeah, my condolences.
I heard about that.

44:05.491 --> 44:07.459
You sure that's all you
did was hear about it?

44:08.727 --> 44:10.327
Come on, now, Q.

44:10.329 --> 44:12.462
You ever known me to be petty
about some shit like that?

44:12.464 --> 44:14.431
Especially if it ain't got
nothing to do with business.

44:14.433 --> 44:16.768
I wasn't even in the A
when your man got hit.

44:16.770 --> 44:19.469
That don't mean shit. All
it take is one phone call.

44:19.471 --> 44:21.506
It does mean something.

44:21.508 --> 44:23.408
If I was a petty-ass nigga
and wanted to do something

44:23.410 --> 44:25.777
'cause Juju tried
to pull a gun out on me,

44:25.779 --> 44:28.279
don't you think I'd do it myself?
I don't need no damn help.

44:28.281 --> 44:30.882
But I didn't. I didn't make no
calls, and I was out of town.

44:30.884 --> 44:33.154
Where the fuck your boy
Eddie was, though?

44:34.287 --> 44:35.988
With me.

44:35.990 --> 44:37.024
Sure he was.

45:04.019 --> 45:05.687
Congratulations.

45:09.358 --> 45:11.493
After tonight, you stay
away from the gallery.

45:12.661 --> 45:13.762
You hear me?

45:23.305 --> 45:25.005
Yeah, we golden, baby.

45:26.309 --> 45:27.875
Good.

45:27.877 --> 45:29.144
A'ight.

45:29.146 --> 45:30.147
Load this up.

45:31.048 --> 45:32.049
Come on.

45:45.562 --> 45:47.731
You're lucky I don't make you
work naked, motherfucker.

45:50.300 --> 45:51.900
- Hey, do something.
- All right, all right.

45:51.902 --> 45:53.301
Fucking do something.

45:55.539 --> 45:56.939
Yeah!

45:56.941 --> 45:58.373
The manager
will see you now.

46:02.680 --> 46:04.179
Yes, sir.

46:05.550 --> 46:06.551
Fellows.

47:27.268 --> 47:28.970
I say, uh-huh.

47:32.608 --> 47:35.342
Mmm-hmm. And behind
door number one.

47:49.759 --> 47:51.192
Oh, man.

47:51.194 --> 47:52.593
- Cheers to that.
- To the hustle, baby.

47:52.595 --> 47:54.035
Hey, you're my
motherfucking brother.

51:30.524 --> 51:32.258
Answer the phone,
are you deaf?

51:46.273 --> 51:51.080
No, this sport is stupid
and I don't give a shit.

52:17.439 --> 52:19.274
Wow.

52:19.276 --> 52:20.841
You look nice.

52:20.843 --> 52:23.312
Thank you, baby. So do you.

52:24.247 --> 52:26.647
Come downstairs with me.

52:26.649 --> 52:28.850
For what? People won't be
here for another hour.

52:28.852 --> 52:30.185
I know.

52:30.187 --> 52:32.420
Just come downstairs.

52:32.422 --> 52:33.755
All right,
give me a second.

52:33.757 --> 52:35.126
Like today,
though, please.

52:36.928 --> 52:39.030
- Georgia!
- Yes. Coming. Coming.

52:41.933 --> 52:44.067
You hungry?

52:44.069 --> 52:45.635
- Huh?
- I said, are you hungry?

52:47.404 --> 52:48.639
I could eat.

52:49.740 --> 52:51.774
What is this?

52:51.776 --> 52:52.844
Just a little something.

52:54.079 --> 52:55.346
You're too sweet.

52:58.183 --> 53:00.683
Hold up. Hold up.
I got to be a gentleman now.

53:00.685 --> 53:01.719
Oh.

53:03.487 --> 53:05.487
- Madam.
- Thank you.

53:08.127 --> 53:09.996
Wow. Look at this.

53:12.497 --> 53:14.000
That's fine. Thanks.

53:17.303 --> 53:19.070
Takes some getting
used to, you know,

53:19.072 --> 53:21.172
being served
in your own house.

53:21.174 --> 53:23.041
You earned it.

53:23.043 --> 53:25.408
You, all of us, really,

53:25.410 --> 53:28.679
are always exactly
where we're meant to be.

53:28.681 --> 53:31.682
- You believe that?
- I do.

53:31.684 --> 53:33.718
When I was in school,
this girl Janelle

53:33.720 --> 53:35.354
lived like this
her whole life.

53:35.356 --> 53:37.655
In college, her dad
actually got arrested.

53:37.657 --> 53:39.158
He was a big money guy,

53:39.160 --> 53:41.226
something to do
with the financial crisis.

53:41.228 --> 53:42.727
He ripped off
a bunch of old people.

53:42.729 --> 53:44.695
It was a big deal.
Made it to the news.

53:44.697 --> 53:47.299
His case went from
front page news

53:47.301 --> 53:50.501
to back page write-up
about some bullshit fine

53:50.503 --> 53:51.983
and a small settlement.

53:53.340 --> 53:55.340
I learned then
that the difference

53:55.342 --> 53:57.043
between a businessman
and a crook

53:57.045 --> 53:59.478
is the type of lawyer
you can afford.

53:59.480 --> 54:02.918
Is that what you see me as?
As a crook?

54:03.717 --> 54:05.417
No.

54:05.419 --> 54:08.390
I see a man,
my man,

54:09.926 --> 54:11.858
taking care
of his business

54:11.860 --> 54:14.727
and getting things right so
that, when this is all done,

54:14.729 --> 54:16.030
you can be free.

54:17.934 --> 54:20.234
I'm so sorry
about that.

54:20.236 --> 54:21.270
You're fine.

54:31.213 --> 54:33.116
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah.

54:35.986 --> 54:37.152
- What up, man?
- Yeah, man.

54:37.154 --> 54:40.255
Hey, I got your
money, too, boy.

54:40.257 --> 54:41.655
- My nigga, what's happening?
- What's up?

54:41.657 --> 54:43.826
- I see you.
- I see you.

54:44.895 --> 54:46.227
What's up, boy?

54:46.229 --> 54:48.296
Thanks for coming.
Ready to get that money?

54:48.298 --> 54:50.099
Finna get that money, son.

54:50.101 --> 54:51.498
- Top to bottom.
- A'ight, player.

54:51.500 --> 54:52.501
Yeah.

54:54.138 --> 54:55.871
- Yo, what up, baby boy?
- What's up, boy?

54:55.873 --> 54:57.907
Hey, man, you still
down to talk, right?

54:57.909 --> 54:59.641
- Yeah.
- Yo.

54:59.643 --> 55:01.810
I really need you
to hear me out, man.

55:01.812 --> 55:03.446
Freddie, you got
to take it easy, now.

55:03.448 --> 55:05.416
I done told you,
I got you. Relax.

55:07.086 --> 55:08.153
Everybody, listen up!

55:10.788 --> 55:13.422
I just want to start off
by saying thank you.

55:13.424 --> 55:15.391
Okay? I want to say
thank you to my team.

55:15.393 --> 55:17.793
I want to say thank you
to every single one of y'all.

55:17.795 --> 55:19.528
I know it's been hard
on you, laying low,

55:19.530 --> 55:21.198
staying off the grid
and still being hard at work,

55:21.200 --> 55:24.035
but y'all been doing that,
and I'm proud of y'all.

55:24.037 --> 55:26.938
So, tonight, we gonna
drink, we gonna eat,

55:26.940 --> 55:28.973
we gonna smoke something
if you have it.

55:28.975 --> 55:30.506
We gonna turn up, a'ight?

55:30.508 --> 55:32.642
So this is to y'all. <i>Salud!</i>

55:32.644 --> 55:34.981
<i>Salud!</i>

55:53.500 --> 55:56.261
- What's going on, baby?
- What's happening? What's happening?

55:56.603 --> 55:59.570
Look, I need you
to fall back a little bit.

55:59.572 --> 56:01.606
Word will get out
about a price drop.

56:01.608 --> 56:04.343
People being how people are,
they'll start asking questions.

56:04.345 --> 56:06.211
You know, asking
how, asking why.

56:06.213 --> 56:08.280
Now, Racks, they find out that
we're flooding the market,

56:08.282 --> 56:10.116
we're gonna have beef we don't need.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

56:10.118 --> 56:13.185
Priest, I respect that,
and we don't need no beef.

56:13.187 --> 56:16.321
But for me to move the amount
of work you want me to move,

56:16.323 --> 56:18.491
at the pace you
want me to move,

56:18.493 --> 56:20.225
we got to cut the numbers.

56:20.227 --> 56:21.727
Then cut the numbers.
I don't care.

56:21.729 --> 56:23.263
I just need you to move it
somewhere else.

56:23.265 --> 56:25.198
I got people in Cashville.

56:25.200 --> 56:26.900
They can move whatever the
fuck we throw at 'em.

56:26.902 --> 56:28.368
You got your lane, Freddie.

56:28.370 --> 56:30.437
We don't need these
motherfuckers, man.

56:30.439 --> 56:31.972
Shut the fuck up, man!

56:31.974 --> 56:34.174
- Who the fuck is this motherfucker?
- Hey.

56:34.176 --> 56:35.876
We'll put
that bitch in a hole.

56:35.878 --> 56:37.343
He's a fucking termite.

56:37.345 --> 56:38.778
Everybody, calm down.
We good. We good.

56:38.780 --> 56:40.747
- A'ight? We good.
- Are we good?

56:40.749 --> 56:42.829
- Hey, yeah, we good. We good.
- Listen to me.

56:43.852 --> 56:44.954
Come on, now.

56:46.255 --> 56:47.290
Hey.

56:51.128 --> 56:53.861
I don't like this fat
motherfucker, man.

56:53.863 --> 56:55.763
Look, man, we good.
Don't worry about that shit.

56:55.765 --> 56:57.364
A'ight? We're getting
too much money, baby.

56:57.366 --> 56:59.534
A'ight? Look
at this fucking jacket.

56:59.536 --> 57:01.976
- You look good, nigga.
- We got history to make, baby.

57:03.407 --> 57:05.373
Please tell me what the
fuck just happened.

57:05.375 --> 57:07.876
- That's your boy.
- That was funny as hell.

57:07.878 --> 57:09.244
I almost had
to fight that big nigga.

57:09.246 --> 57:10.778
God, I wanted to see
them niggas roll

57:10.780 --> 57:12.615
in their good clothes.
I really did, though.

57:13.717 --> 57:15.350
No, but seriously, look.

57:15.352 --> 57:16.852
The way shit is
going right now,

57:16.854 --> 57:18.253
like, the numbers
we doing right now,

57:18.255 --> 57:19.522
we should've been
doing since day one.

57:19.524 --> 57:21.891
Shit is moving
smooth like butter.

57:21.893 --> 57:24.161
Like, you a fucking genius,
Priest. I can't even lie.

57:24.163 --> 57:25.723
Who's to say we
can't keep this shit up?

57:26.464 --> 57:28.231
Hmm?

57:28.233 --> 57:30.067
Who's to say we can't be
bigger than the Sno Patrol

57:30.069 --> 57:31.733
with they bitch ass?

57:31.735 --> 57:34.470
Like, seriously, the way
shit is running right now

57:34.472 --> 57:36.573
is the reason we got in the
game in the first place.

57:36.575 --> 57:38.276
Is that a George Daniels
on your wrist?

57:39.111 --> 57:40.776
Oh, yeah.

57:40.778 --> 57:42.481
I ain't show you
this bitch yet, right?

57:44.450 --> 57:45.815
It's nice, but do you
think it's smart

57:45.817 --> 57:47.286
to be wearing that
at this time?

57:48.420 --> 57:50.021
Hmm?

57:50.023 --> 57:52.256
At this party?

57:52.258 --> 57:54.258
These dumb motherfuckers don't
even know what they're looking at.

57:54.260 --> 57:55.927
- Doesn't matter.
- I'm not talking about them, Eddie.

57:55.929 --> 57:58.096
I'm talking
about the police.

57:58.098 --> 58:01.832
One cop sees you wearing
a $600,000 watch,

58:01.834 --> 58:03.268
he's gonna wonder
how that nigga got that.

58:03.270 --> 58:05.003
That's all it takes.
One thread, Eddie. One...

58:05.005 --> 58:06.105
Yeah, to unravel
the whole fucking sweater.

58:06.107 --> 58:07.706
Priest, I get it. God damn!

58:09.842 --> 58:12.644
This fucking preaching.
You know what I'mma do?

58:12.646 --> 58:14.947
I'mma take the watch home. I'm
gonna put it inside a safe,

58:14.949 --> 58:16.247
and put it in another safe,

58:16.249 --> 58:17.809
and then forget
I got the fucking watch.

58:20.787 --> 58:22.156
That make you happy?

58:23.124 --> 58:24.125
Great.

58:39.641 --> 58:42.042
Yo, man, why Priest
do me like that?

58:42.044 --> 58:44.477
- Do you like what, G?
- Yo, all that "stay in your lane" shit.

58:44.479 --> 58:47.148
Because you ain't never sold nothing
a day in your fucking life.

58:47.150 --> 58:48.747
I mean, you the muscle.
Just be the muscle.

58:48.749 --> 58:51.318
No, man, but the shit we got
fucking sells itself, nigga.

58:51.320 --> 58:52.819
Man, it ain't
that simple, man.

58:52.821 --> 58:54.989
Man, then why don't you
let me prove myself, huh?

58:54.991 --> 58:56.356
You're giving work
to everybody else,

58:56.358 --> 58:59.026
and I been here
since fucking day one, man.

58:59.028 --> 59:01.898
How do you think it feels to watch all
these motherfuckers get caked up?

59:04.467 --> 59:05.467
Eddie.

59:06.835 --> 59:07.904
Yo, Eddie.

59:09.073 --> 59:11.574
Man, look,
I'll give you one brick.

59:13.143 --> 59:14.876
- Thank you, man.
- You happy?

59:14.878 --> 59:16.844
- Appreciate you, man.
- Well, appreciate this ass.

59:16.846 --> 59:18.479
That's what you need
to be appreciating.

59:18.481 --> 59:20.748
- These asses.
- I fucking knew it.

59:20.750 --> 59:22.417
Oh, shit. Yo, baby.

59:22.419 --> 59:23.919
- Baby...
- Yeah. No, no, no.

59:23.921 --> 59:25.988
Don't give me
that calm voice shit.

59:25.990 --> 59:28.257
This bitch your side chick?
This bitch?

59:28.259 --> 59:30.692
Trust me. You don't want
to see it with this bitch!

59:30.694 --> 59:32.427
- Bitch, I will whup your ass!
- Oh, no, chill, ladies.

59:32.429 --> 59:34.396
- We'll talk about this later.
- Talk about what?

59:34.398 --> 59:35.932
Talk about how you putting
all our business

59:35.934 --> 59:37.566
- on the line for this trick?
- Bitch!

59:47.612 --> 59:48.978
Oh!

59:48.980 --> 59:50.181
Come on, man.

59:55.755 --> 59:57.220
No! No!

59:57.222 --> 59:59.759
- Stupid bitch!
- I will beat your ass!

01:00:02.962 --> 01:00:04.163
You better get her!

01:00:22.783 --> 01:00:25.150
Our guy been
up to anything?

01:00:25.152 --> 01:00:28.720
Since getting back
from El Paso? Not much.

01:00:28.722 --> 01:00:32.158
Living life like a retiree,
except with younger women.

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:35.860
Doesn't seem like he's
up to much, you ask me.

01:00:35.862 --> 01:00:38.463
What's the buzz
been about at the precincts?

01:00:38.465 --> 01:00:40.933
- Concerning?
- Narcotics.

01:00:40.935 --> 01:00:43.536
Has law enforcement noticed

01:00:43.538 --> 01:00:45.538
any change
in the market at all?

01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:47.940
Recent influx
of pills locally.

01:00:47.942 --> 01:00:50.476
- Charlotte, too, from what I've heard.
- Hmm.

01:00:50.478 --> 01:00:52.311
All right, well,

01:00:52.313 --> 01:00:53.446
here you are.

01:00:53.448 --> 01:00:54.515
It's all there.

01:00:55.616 --> 01:00:58.051
That's not lemon pepper?

01:00:58.053 --> 01:01:01.588
Hawaiian.
Trying something new.

01:01:01.590 --> 01:01:02.658
Aren't we all?

01:01:12.168 --> 01:01:14.534
- You sure about this?
- Positive.

01:01:14.536 --> 01:01:16.770
That nigga say he
gonna lay one on me?

01:01:16.772 --> 01:01:18.041
Well, he didn't
tell me that.

01:01:24.781 --> 01:01:27.115
I'm gonna need you to better
explain yourself, a'ight?

01:01:27.117 --> 01:01:29.884
Look, he's been acting
real funny lately,

01:01:29.886 --> 01:01:32.186
so I just knew he was seeing
somebody on the side.

01:01:32.188 --> 01:01:34.056
Always lying about
where he been at.

01:01:34.058 --> 01:01:36.491
- How you know he was lying?
- Because I went on his phone.

01:01:36.493 --> 01:01:38.861
- Turned the locator on.
- Fuck all that.

01:01:38.863 --> 01:01:40.363
Tell us what we
want to hear.

01:01:42.533 --> 01:01:44.900
Look, the day
you got shot at,

01:01:44.902 --> 01:01:47.235
Fat-Ass told me he was
gonna cop some sneakers

01:01:47.237 --> 01:01:48.837
down in Little Five Points.

01:01:48.839 --> 01:01:50.274
But he wasn't there.

01:01:59.851 --> 01:02:02.554
Same date, same time,
same location as the shooting.

01:02:05.424 --> 01:02:07.157
Technology's a bitch.

01:02:09.027 --> 01:02:11.528
So is a woman scorned.

01:02:16.169 --> 01:02:18.470
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

01:02:24.443 --> 01:02:25.578
Here he comes.

01:02:27.212 --> 01:02:29.549
You ever kill a bitch
with a dick in her mouth?

01:02:31.617 --> 01:02:33.384
Yo, take that shit off.

01:02:33.386 --> 01:02:35.506
- What, baby, my shirt?
- Take that fucking shirt off.

01:02:38.158 --> 01:02:40.257
Cops. Duck.

01:02:41.995 --> 01:02:43.315
Bring it over here.
Bring it here.

01:02:46.232 --> 01:02:48.133
Ooh.

01:02:51.805 --> 01:02:52.941
Oh...

01:03:09.657 --> 01:03:11.777
Oh. Get the fuck up. Get the fuck up.
Get the fuck up.

01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:21.804
I don't know if it's that nigga's
lucky day or his unlucky day.

01:03:22.437 --> 01:03:23.672
Fuck!

01:03:30.981 --> 01:03:33.282
Don't say a fucking word.
Don't say shit.

01:03:39.221 --> 01:03:41.355
Having
ourselves a night, are we?

01:03:41.357 --> 01:03:43.223
Is there a problem, Officer?

01:03:43.225 --> 01:03:45.059
How much you charging,
sweetheart?

01:03:45.061 --> 01:03:47.061
Hey, I ain't
a fucking prostitute.

01:03:47.063 --> 01:03:49.531
Yo, chill. Don't say
fucking shit before this...

01:03:49.533 --> 01:03:52.567
Before this officer asks you
to step out of the car?

01:03:52.569 --> 01:03:54.235
It's too late.
Step out of the car, please.

01:03:54.237 --> 01:03:57.007
God damn it. God damn it.
Fucking told you!

01:03:57.009 --> 01:03:58.473
Get the fuck up out the car!

01:03:58.475 --> 01:04:00.510
- I told you not to say shit!
- Let's go.

01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:13.054
Jackpot.

01:05:16.958 --> 01:05:18.492
Let's go. Get the fuck
out of the car.

01:05:34.576 --> 01:05:35.644
All right.

01:05:36.578 --> 01:05:38.946
Gun. Cocaine.

01:05:38.948 --> 01:05:41.249
- It's all yours, right?
- I want a lawyer.

01:05:42.350 --> 01:05:44.317
"A lawyer"?

01:05:44.319 --> 01:05:46.252
You're not under arrest.
Did you arrest him?

01:05:46.254 --> 01:05:47.989
Uh-uh.

01:05:47.991 --> 01:05:49.859
Just having a conversation
in a public place.

01:05:51.794 --> 01:05:53.661
That's a whole lot
of cocaine, man.

01:05:53.663 --> 01:05:55.665
Can't all be for
personal use, can it?

01:05:57.700 --> 01:05:58.834
Don't want to talk?

01:06:01.771 --> 01:06:03.005
All right.

01:06:11.313 --> 01:06:12.482
Wow.

01:06:20.190 --> 01:06:21.790
You're amongst friends.

01:06:21.792 --> 01:06:22.895
I insist.

01:06:27.799 --> 01:06:30.167
Know what my
problem with you is?

01:06:30.169 --> 01:06:35.005
This shit's way too pure,
and you got way too much of it

01:06:35.007 --> 01:06:36.875
for me to not know
who the fuck you are.

01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:42.882
Still silent. All right.

01:06:51.891 --> 01:06:53.190
Say "cheese."

01:06:54.727 --> 01:06:56.760
You're making
my life too easy.

01:06:56.762 --> 01:06:58.495
All right. "Eddie."

01:06:58.497 --> 01:07:00.731
Most of your texts and
calls are to this guy.

01:07:00.733 --> 01:07:02.666
Can't be your boyfriend.

01:07:02.668 --> 01:07:04.367
You got way too many pussy
pics to be on the down-low.

01:07:04.369 --> 01:07:06.570
What is he, your connect?
No. Nah.

01:07:06.572 --> 01:07:07.612
See, you're not connected.

01:07:09.274 --> 01:07:10.643
Your boss, right?

01:07:11.444 --> 01:07:12.579
Bingo.

01:07:13.513 --> 01:07:15.313
"Eddie."

01:07:15.315 --> 01:07:17.482
You know an Eddie
who's getting it like this?

01:07:17.484 --> 01:07:19.650
- Not like that.
- See, now I'm really pissed

01:07:19.652 --> 01:07:22.820
'cause that's two people
I should know that I don't.

01:07:22.822 --> 01:07:24.059
Get her out of the car.

01:07:25.558 --> 01:07:26.559
Let's go, sweetheart.

01:07:31.431 --> 01:07:33.933
No! No,
please don't do it! Don't do it.

01:07:33.935 --> 01:07:36.403
- Tell me who Eddie is.
- Don't say a fucking word.

01:07:39.074 --> 01:07:40.706
I just...

01:07:40.708 --> 01:07:42.244
Big man's working
for Eddie, right?

01:07:44.914 --> 01:07:46.647
Yeah. Eddie.

01:07:47.414 --> 01:07:48.449
Him and Priest.

01:07:50.384 --> 01:07:51.520
"Priest"?

01:07:52.254 --> 01:07:54.088
Damn.

01:07:54.090 --> 01:07:55.457
I don't know
who he is, either.

01:07:59.095 --> 01:08:00.164
But I do now.

01:08:22.252 --> 01:08:23.618
You gonna take
your girl home.

01:08:25.621 --> 01:08:26.823
And drive carefully.

01:08:28.225 --> 01:08:29.425
You gonna
see me around.

01:08:33.764 --> 01:08:35.198
Let's go.
Get the fuck out.

01:08:36.265 --> 01:08:37.301
Let's go.

01:08:40.270 --> 01:08:41.337
Come on.

01:08:51.616 --> 01:08:52.750
Motherfucker.

01:08:54.319 --> 01:08:56.685
What was I
supposed to do, Freddie?

01:08:56.688 --> 01:08:58.055
Baby, they were
gonna kill you.

01:08:58.057 --> 01:09:00.991
I ain't mad at you.
I just got to figure out

01:09:00.993 --> 01:09:03.027
how to tell Priest
about this shit.

01:09:04.696 --> 01:09:07.131
Look at this motherfucker.
Look at this motherfucker.

01:09:07.133 --> 01:09:08.267
What does he want now?

01:09:24.986 --> 01:09:26.886
Can I see your license
and registration, please, sir?

01:09:26.888 --> 01:09:28.652
Look, man,
you really need to see

01:09:28.654 --> 01:09:30.520
- my motherfucking license...
- Hands off the gun.

01:09:30.522 --> 01:09:31.991
- What?
- Hands off the gun!

01:09:52.613 --> 01:09:54.346
The cops saved
that nigga life, Q.

01:09:54.348 --> 01:09:55.547
I'm gonna have that bitch

01:09:55.549 --> 01:09:57.516
set up Fat Freddie
next time, though.

01:09:57.518 --> 01:09:58.918
Freddie might have
been the shooter.

01:09:59.854 --> 01:10:01.587
I ain't gonna doubt that.

01:10:01.589 --> 01:10:03.455
But Freddie don't
call no shots, though.

01:10:03.457 --> 01:10:05.061
And if we make
a move on him right now,

01:10:06.194 --> 01:10:08.062
we gonna wake Priest up.

01:10:08.064 --> 01:10:10.429
We need him sleep.
Fuck Freddie.

01:10:10.431 --> 01:10:12.299
Q, what the fuck is you talking
about, "Fuck Freddie..."

01:10:12.301 --> 01:10:16.070
Listen, nigga! This shit
is chess, not checkers.

01:10:16.072 --> 01:10:18.571
Once we knock the king off,
the rest of the pieces

01:10:18.573 --> 01:10:20.473
on the board
don't even fucking matter.

01:10:20.475 --> 01:10:23.779
If I have to, I'll kill that pussy-ass
nigga Priest my goddamn self.

01:10:24.746 --> 01:10:27.049
Yo, boss.

01:10:27.051 --> 01:10:29.250
<i>...Frederick Davis
and 25-year-old Rochelle Saunders.</i>

01:10:29.252 --> 01:10:31.752
<i>Police say that
Davis did not comply</i>

01:10:31.754 --> 01:10:34.355
<i>with instructions
and reached for a gun.</i>

01:10:34.357 --> 01:10:36.124
<i>That's when
the officer fired.</i>

01:10:36.126 --> 01:10:38.927
Based on the initial report,
Mayor Atkins believes

01:10:38.929 --> 01:10:41.595
the shooting to be justified
and is calling the officer,

01:10:41.597 --> 01:10:43.698
<i>Turk Franklin, a hero.</i>

01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:46.035
<i>Hands off the gun.
Hands off the gun!</i>

01:10:46.037 --> 01:10:48.569
Yeah, we're here for
anything that you need.

01:10:48.571 --> 01:10:51.140
All right? Anything.

01:10:51.142 --> 01:10:53.177
All right. Sorry
for your loss, Ms. Davis.

01:10:53.979 --> 01:10:55.179
I will. Bye.

01:10:59.650 --> 01:11:01.284
Something ain't right.

01:11:01.286 --> 01:11:03.446
Yeah, something ain't right.
They fucking murdered him!

01:11:30.117 --> 01:11:32.515
- Can I help you?
- What do you guys do in here?

01:11:32.517 --> 01:11:36.154
This a Mickey Mouse
Clubhouse?

01:11:36.156 --> 01:11:38.822
Uh, it's our place of business.
You mind telling us yours?

01:11:38.824 --> 01:11:41.092
Oh, I'm Detective Mason.
This here is Officer Franklin.

01:11:41.094 --> 01:11:42.826
He's become a little bit
of a local celebrity,

01:11:42.828 --> 01:11:43.964
if you hadn't heard.

01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:48.100
Oh, this is nice.

01:11:48.102 --> 01:11:49.767
Well, you can talk to our
lawyers if you have any...

01:11:49.769 --> 01:11:51.436
"Lawyer"? That must be
the company slogan.

01:11:51.438 --> 01:11:53.438
That's exactly
what Freddie said.

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:55.340
Not that you want the same thing
to happen to you, do you?

01:11:55.342 --> 01:11:58.010
Man, fuck you!
Fuck you, too!

01:11:58.012 --> 01:12:00.146
- For real!
- How much?

01:12:00.148 --> 01:12:01.713
Now, see, when
you say it like that,

01:12:01.715 --> 01:12:03.581
it makes me feel like
this is a shakedown.

01:12:03.583 --> 01:12:06.218
- Franklin, is this a shakedown?
- Definitely.

01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:08.487
This is a place
of business, right?

01:12:08.489 --> 01:12:09.855
We're gonna be partners.

01:12:09.857 --> 01:12:11.925
We don't just offer
that to anybody.

01:12:11.927 --> 01:12:14.161
Like Sno Patrol.

01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:15.929
They got multiple
investigations on them

01:12:15.931 --> 01:12:17.229
at multiple agencies.

01:12:17.231 --> 01:12:18.664
They could go down
at any minute.

01:12:18.666 --> 01:12:20.500
I've been waiting
a long time

01:12:20.502 --> 01:12:22.701
to find someone who operates
with your kind of discretion.

01:12:22.703 --> 01:12:25.604
How much?

01:12:25.606 --> 01:12:27.541
Partners means partners.

01:12:27.543 --> 01:12:29.809
Fifty-fifty.

01:12:29.811 --> 01:12:31.710
- We'll earn our share, right?
- That's right.

01:12:31.712 --> 01:12:34.916
Heads-up on raids, patrols,
et cetera, et cetera.

01:12:34.918 --> 01:12:37.051
But in the meantime,
I feel like

01:12:37.053 --> 01:12:40.555
we need to have some kind
of goodwill gesture.

01:12:40.557 --> 01:12:42.990
Let's say a million-dollar gesture.

01:12:42.992 --> 01:12:44.559
By the end of the week.

01:12:44.561 --> 01:12:45.562
Deal?

01:12:48.664 --> 01:12:50.831
Hey. Deal?

01:12:50.833 --> 01:12:51.969
Say it.

01:12:55.438 --> 01:12:56.773
Come on, Priest,
just say it.

01:13:00.643 --> 01:13:01.744
Deal.

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:04.713
Attaboy.

01:13:07.784 --> 01:13:08.954
Thanks, man.

01:13:11.654 --> 01:13:12.989
I get it.

01:13:12.991 --> 01:13:14.624
He scares the shit
out of me, too.

01:13:16.293 --> 01:13:17.294
Before we go,

01:13:18.796 --> 01:13:20.364
I think this belongs to you.

01:13:26.471 --> 01:13:27.472
Son of a bitch!

01:13:54.267 --> 01:13:56.101
You're the reason
we're in this shit.

01:13:56.103 --> 01:13:58.970
- What?
- You're the reason that Freddie's dead.

01:13:58.972 --> 01:14:00.040
Fuck you, Priest.

01:14:01.475 --> 01:14:03.108
I'm wrong?

01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:04.943
If you didn't give him that
brick, he'd still be alive.

01:14:04.945 --> 01:14:06.478
If you didn't
want to expand,

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:08.647
I would've never gave him
the fucking brick!

01:14:08.649 --> 01:14:09.982
He wanted to get put on.

01:14:09.984 --> 01:14:11.815
There's no coming
back from that.

01:14:11.817 --> 01:14:13.451
Now we in the bed with the
fucking police forever.

01:14:13.453 --> 01:14:15.187
Not forever. It's gonna
take longer than I thought

01:14:15.189 --> 01:14:17.657
'cause of your dumb ass, but
we stick to the plan, Eddie.

01:14:17.659 --> 01:14:19.559
What plan?
You still talking about

01:14:19.561 --> 01:14:21.826
this dumb-ass shit
about us getting out the game

01:14:21.828 --> 01:14:23.728
and finding somewhere
safe to land?

01:14:23.730 --> 01:14:25.197
We black men!

01:14:25.199 --> 01:14:26.899
There ain't nowhere safe
on this fucking planet!

01:14:26.901 --> 01:14:28.000
So what you wanna do?

01:14:28.002 --> 01:14:30.070
You want to stay here, right?

01:14:30.072 --> 01:14:31.703
That's our best
fucking option!

01:14:31.705 --> 01:14:33.874
We rolling with
the police now.

01:14:33.876 --> 01:14:35.541
It's in their best interest to
protect us and keep us out of jail.

01:14:35.543 --> 01:14:37.144
Until it isn't!

01:14:37.146 --> 01:14:38.979
Until they do to us
what they did to Freddie

01:14:38.981 --> 01:14:41.682
'cause they own you
until they kill you.

01:14:41.684 --> 01:14:43.517
Why are you such
a goddamn fool, nigga?

01:14:43.519 --> 01:14:46.987
Me? Who got us
into this shit?

01:14:46.989 --> 01:14:49.289
You did this shit,
Priest! Not me!

01:14:49.291 --> 01:14:51.059
Eddie, touch me again,
nigga. I swear...

01:14:51.061 --> 01:14:52.459
- What the fuck you gonna do, Priest?
- Touch me...

01:14:52.461 --> 01:14:53.821
What the fuck
you gonna do, Priest?

01:14:54.164 --> 01:14:55.231
Motherfucker!

01:14:58.200 --> 01:14:59.201
Yeah!

01:15:12.083 --> 01:15:13.882
Fuck you doing, Priest?

01:15:13.884 --> 01:15:15.318
You motherfucker!

01:15:33.138 --> 01:15:34.139
Fuck!

01:16:03.469 --> 01:16:05.336
I've been in touch
with the consulate

01:16:05.338 --> 01:16:07.938
where we can be citizens of a
country with no extradition treaty.

01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:10.741
- The police can't touch us.
- They're not police.

01:16:10.743 --> 01:16:12.743
- They're murderers.
- If they're murderers,

01:16:12.745 --> 01:16:14.146
how else we gonna
get rid of them?

01:16:14.148 --> 01:16:15.846
We don't.
We get rid of ourselves.

01:16:17.817 --> 01:16:21.352
These dirty-ass cops, Sno
Patrol, they're violating us.

01:16:21.354 --> 01:16:22.988
We shouldn't have
to run from anyone.

01:16:24.124 --> 01:16:25.524
We should wipe them all out.

01:16:25.526 --> 01:16:26.925
Now, who gonna do
all that gangsta shit, you?

01:16:26.927 --> 01:16:28.026
If I have to.

01:16:28.028 --> 01:16:29.428
I've done this shit,
remember?

01:16:29.430 --> 01:16:30.662
Then what?

01:16:30.664 --> 01:16:31.930
Hmm?

01:16:31.932 --> 01:16:33.465
You're gonna end up
on the run anyway,

01:16:33.467 --> 01:16:35.302
or you're gonna end up
in a cage, so stop it.

01:16:36.905 --> 01:16:39.606
- We have enough to leave.
- It's not enough.

01:16:43.177 --> 01:16:44.777
What's enough?

01:16:44.779 --> 01:16:47.480
$2 million? 5? 25?

01:16:47.482 --> 01:16:49.551
Or until you end up
like Fat Freddie?

01:16:53.755 --> 01:16:56.622
I don't give a damn
about any of that shit.

01:16:56.624 --> 01:16:58.358
I give a damn about you.

01:16:58.360 --> 01:16:59.993
Think, Priest,

01:16:59.995 --> 01:17:01.929
about everything
that you've built.

01:17:01.931 --> 01:17:03.597
Don't be so quick
to throw it all away

01:17:03.599 --> 01:17:05.099
just 'cause you're
going through some shit.

01:17:05.101 --> 01:17:06.533
I can't believe you
right now.

01:17:06.535 --> 01:17:09.536
- Yeah, 'cause you're fucking soft.
- "Soft"?

01:17:09.538 --> 01:17:11.004
I've had his back
since day one,

01:17:11.006 --> 01:17:12.573
and I had your back
since day one,

01:17:12.575 --> 01:17:14.541
so don't give me not shit
about being soft...

01:17:14.543 --> 01:17:15.642
- Stop. Stop!
- Everything is warm and fuzzy to you.

01:17:15.644 --> 01:17:18.379
Both of you shut the fuck up!

01:17:18.381 --> 01:17:19.814
I don't know who you think

01:17:19.816 --> 01:17:22.083
you're talking to!

01:17:22.085 --> 01:17:24.853
But I am on your side, okay? I'm
trying to get us out of this!

01:17:24.855 --> 01:17:27.655
Look. Look, you're right. You're right.
You're right, okay?

01:17:27.657 --> 01:17:30.058
We're gonna get our money.
We're gonna get our passports,

01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:32.629
and after Freddie's funeral,
we will get away for good.

01:17:33.497 --> 01:17:35.532
Do you understand?

01:18:11.670 --> 01:18:15.940
Another option to gain a passport
is to invest $1.5 million U.S.

01:18:15.942 --> 01:18:18.608
into a government-approved
real estate project,

01:18:18.610 --> 01:18:22.615
and you can have your citizenship
for only $500,000 each.

01:18:30.189 --> 01:18:31.624
Do you take cash?

01:18:39.901 --> 01:18:41.234
Well, of course.

01:20:14.065 --> 01:20:16.732
Get in the car. Make sure Ms.
Davis is all right.

01:20:16.734 --> 01:20:19.537
- Priest, but we...
- Just get in the car, please.

01:20:48.002 --> 01:20:49.366
What is he doing here?

01:20:49.368 --> 01:20:51.402
Oh, I'm on
mandatory leave.

01:20:51.404 --> 01:20:55.173
It's standard procedure after
an officer-involved shooting.

01:20:55.175 --> 01:20:58.944
Figured I'd pay my respects
to the money you owe us.

01:20:58.946 --> 01:21:00.612
Jesus. Clearly,
this was a bad idea.

01:21:00.614 --> 01:21:03.016
Why don't you just give us
what we came for.

01:21:03.018 --> 01:21:04.651
We'll get out of your
silky smooth hair.

01:21:06.419 --> 01:21:09.187
Were you beaten as a child?

01:21:09.189 --> 01:21:10.256
All the time.

01:21:15.630 --> 01:21:17.498
Nice bag.

01:21:18.934 --> 01:21:20.799
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

01:21:20.801 --> 01:21:22.167
No offense.

01:21:22.169 --> 01:21:23.873
Trust has to be
earned, right?

01:21:27.676 --> 01:21:28.878
It's good.

01:21:29.912 --> 01:21:31.912
Think you got it bad?

01:21:31.914 --> 01:21:34.282
I got to work with
this guy every day.

01:21:56.006 --> 01:21:57.407
My condolences.

01:21:59.877 --> 01:22:02.510
You reaching for the burner
in the center trap?

01:22:02.512 --> 01:22:04.013
- I know how you think.
- Scatter...

01:22:04.015 --> 01:22:05.348
Shut the fuck up.

01:22:08.153 --> 01:22:10.485
So you put a man
on me, huh?

01:22:10.487 --> 01:22:13.622
That's cool. I could
put a man on you, too.

01:22:13.624 --> 01:22:16.291
- Scatter, I have a plan. I've been...
- Shh.

01:22:16.293 --> 01:22:17.996
Come on, let's take a ride.

01:22:35.981 --> 01:22:38.214
Look, will you just take
this L, Scatter, please?

01:22:38.216 --> 01:22:40.216
Get out while you still can.

01:22:40.218 --> 01:22:43.187
Take the L, huh?

01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:45.856
You know, there's a difference
between getting out

01:22:45.858 --> 01:22:47.623
and being pushed out.

01:22:47.625 --> 01:22:49.527
I won't stand for that,
Youngblood.

01:22:52.330 --> 01:22:53.998
You literally could've taken

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.699
any kid off the corner
and put him under your wing,

01:22:55.701 --> 01:22:57.401
but you chose me.

01:22:57.403 --> 01:23:02.207
- Why?
- Them other young boys, back then,

01:23:02.209 --> 01:23:04.369
they only wanted to hustle
for the money and the flash.

01:23:05.511 --> 01:23:07.679
<i>Everybody want to be somebody.</i>

01:23:07.681 --> 01:23:10.183
<i>Want to be a trap star.</i>

01:23:11.383 --> 01:23:13.385
Want to be superfly.

01:23:14.922 --> 01:23:16.889
<i>Not you.</i>

01:23:16.891 --> 01:23:18.323
<i>You were different.</i>

01:23:18.325 --> 01:23:20.926
<i>Cared less about that stuff.</i>

01:23:20.928 --> 01:23:22.761
Who the fuck is that?

01:23:22.763 --> 01:23:25.563
It's Priest. My man I
was telling you about.

01:23:25.565 --> 01:23:28.600
- He got it all planned out.
- So these fools think

01:23:28.602 --> 01:23:31.071
they can come in my cut
and set up a trap, huh?

01:23:31.073 --> 01:23:32.471
Without even checking in?

01:23:32.473 --> 01:23:34.707
Well, time to pay the tax.

01:23:34.709 --> 01:23:36.575
Man, why don't we
just spray 'em?

01:23:36.577 --> 01:23:38.544
Nah, man, pulling that trigger
ain't gonna make it no better.

01:23:38.546 --> 01:23:40.579
In fact,
it'll make it worse.

01:23:40.581 --> 01:23:42.883
See, the trick is, you got to
get past that guard out front.

01:23:42.885 --> 01:23:44.952
Hey, he's about to be
gone in a minute.

01:23:44.954 --> 01:23:46.988
How the fuck
you know that?

01:23:46.990 --> 01:23:48.420
He thinks
he's about to meet

01:23:48.422 --> 01:23:49.891
an 18-year-old freshman
from Georgia State.

01:23:49.893 --> 01:23:52.994
I been catfishing him
for about a month now, so...

01:23:52.996 --> 01:23:55.395
A month, you say?

01:23:55.397 --> 01:23:57.466
That's a pretty big
commitment, youngblood.

01:23:59.334 --> 01:24:01.835
Okay. Are you ready?

01:24:01.837 --> 01:24:03.972
<i>One of the main
things I admired about you</i>

01:24:03.974 --> 01:24:06.508
<i>was the fact that
you thought big.</i>

01:24:08.812 --> 01:24:11.612
Look at your clothes,
for example.

01:24:11.614 --> 01:24:15.183
I taught you how to dress,
but you took it way, way left.

01:24:15.185 --> 01:24:19.453
With your Morris
Day-looking hair.

01:24:19.455 --> 01:24:21.924
Excuse me? Who the...
Who the fuck is Morris Day?

01:24:59.197 --> 01:25:02.333
Is it true, Priest?

01:25:02.335 --> 01:25:03.700
You were gonna
leave town?

01:25:03.702 --> 01:25:05.403
Abandon our business?

01:25:08.976 --> 01:25:10.341
No. Never.

01:25:10.343 --> 01:25:12.676
Look, he's mad
'cause he got cut out.

01:25:12.678 --> 01:25:17.148
I don't blame him for that,
but he's lying.

01:25:17.150 --> 01:25:20.018
Adalberto, how many years I been
working for you and your family?

01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:21.321
Have I ever lied to you?

01:25:26.895 --> 01:25:30.829
As a matter fact,
Scatter, you have.

01:25:57.425 --> 01:26:00.394
This is an
alkaline hydrolysis machine.

01:26:00.396 --> 01:26:03.399
It's much friendlier on the
environment than cremation.

01:26:05.135 --> 01:26:09.770
You and I, Priest,
we share similar values.

01:26:09.772 --> 01:26:13.472
We both abhor
unnecessary violence.

01:26:13.474 --> 01:26:16.643
My brother Augustin on the other
hand, he was out of control.

01:26:16.645 --> 01:26:20.114
You obviously are aware
of his reputation.

01:26:20.116 --> 01:26:23.717
That's why I had
to send him to prison.

01:26:23.719 --> 01:26:25.452
That's right.

01:26:25.454 --> 01:26:27.788
I sent my own
brother to prison.

01:26:27.790 --> 01:26:29.959
My own stereotypical,
ruthless,

01:26:29.961 --> 01:26:32.962
bloody kingpin, who was
eventually gonna bring down

01:26:32.964 --> 01:26:34.964
the whole family. No.

01:26:34.966 --> 01:26:36.633
That's unacceptable.

01:26:39.602 --> 01:26:43.105
I know you can
understand that, Priest.

01:26:43.107 --> 01:26:46.375
You, you're better
than advertised.

01:26:46.377 --> 01:26:49.045
You're better than
Scatter ever was.

01:26:49.047 --> 01:26:52.448
So good that
I had to question myself.

01:26:52.450 --> 01:26:55.919
Scatter had always been
one of our best earners.

01:26:55.921 --> 01:26:59.588
So how come your numbers
were so much better?

01:26:59.590 --> 01:27:02.125
Even after adjusting
for the increase in volume.

01:27:02.127 --> 01:27:03.893
Didn't make sense.

01:27:03.895 --> 01:27:06.896
So I had to take a closer
look at his business.

01:27:06.898 --> 01:27:08.866
A much closer look.

01:27:12.138 --> 01:27:14.040
He was
stealing from me.

01:27:18.276 --> 01:27:22.178
A little skim
every other month.

01:27:22.180 --> 01:27:25.182
Not much.

01:27:25.184 --> 01:27:26.386
But he knew
better than that.

01:27:27.819 --> 01:27:30.520
And now that he's gone,

01:27:30.522 --> 01:27:32.657
there's no way
you're leaving the game.

01:27:34.394 --> 01:27:35.728
Good night, Priest.

01:27:38.631 --> 01:27:39.732
Drive safely.

01:28:07.929 --> 01:28:09.297
Yes, sir.

01:28:13.002 --> 01:28:15.201
Go buy yourself
some new fits.

01:28:15.203 --> 01:28:18.204
Why, so we can buy some
crazy-ass clothes like you?

01:28:18.206 --> 01:28:21.442
Yeah, I know I must be looking
real crazy to you right now,

01:28:21.444 --> 01:28:23.911
but do you know why
a tiger has stripes?

01:28:23.913 --> 01:28:25.814
Why a lion has a mane?

01:28:28.085 --> 01:28:32.020
It's to warn the other animals that
they are not to be fucked with.

01:28:32.022 --> 01:28:34.721
Stop by tomorrow.
Got some more work for y'all.

01:28:34.723 --> 01:28:37.626
Ain't too many shorties know
how to work the long game.

01:28:58.549 --> 01:29:00.451
Baby, you got to talk to me.

01:29:01.685 --> 01:29:02.987
What's going on?

01:29:05.923 --> 01:29:08.792
Scatter, he took me
to the connect,

01:29:09.793 --> 01:29:11.163
and they killed him.

01:29:11.795 --> 01:29:13.132
They what?

01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:18.236
They ain't never
gonna let me out.

01:29:19.704 --> 01:29:20.704
Never.

01:29:22.807 --> 01:29:24.842
Priest, we have to leave.

01:29:26.612 --> 01:29:27.913
I know.

01:29:29.414 --> 01:29:32.382
Call Cynthia.

01:29:32.384 --> 01:29:33.951
- Cyn!
- Cynthia?

01:29:33.953 --> 01:29:36.855
- Cynthia, where are you? Cyn?
- Cyn? Cynthia?

01:29:37.523 --> 01:29:39.689
What's up?

01:29:39.691 --> 01:29:42.026
Okay, why are you not dressed?
What's going on?

01:29:42.028 --> 01:29:43.928
Look, I understand that this
is serious, but, like...

01:29:43.930 --> 01:29:45.596
No, no, I don't think
you understand...

01:29:45.598 --> 01:29:46.964
I understand better
than the both of y'all.

01:29:46.966 --> 01:29:48.665
Okay? The shit that
we're going through now,

01:29:48.667 --> 01:29:50.301
that's what happens
when you grow.

01:29:50.303 --> 01:29:52.470
You either have the heart
for it, or you don't.

01:29:52.472 --> 01:29:54.605
We're gonna
weather the storm.

01:29:54.607 --> 01:29:55.473
"Weather the storm." Okay, we're
just gonna leave your shit here.

01:29:55.475 --> 01:29:57.341
All right? Come on.

01:29:57.343 --> 01:29:58.676
Upstairs. Go.

01:29:58.678 --> 01:30:00.180
- Fuck!
- Come on!

01:30:01.181 --> 01:30:02.483
Get 'em!

01:30:06.387 --> 01:30:07.388
Go, go, go!

01:30:09.323 --> 01:30:10.556
Run like a bitch!

01:30:10.558 --> 01:30:11.559
Get down! Down!

01:30:15.829 --> 01:30:17.498
Get down,
nigga! Move!

01:30:46.128 --> 01:30:47.128
Okay.

01:30:48.030 --> 01:30:49.731
You motherfucker!

01:30:53.735 --> 01:30:55.571
Shoot up! Shoot her!

01:31:09.086 --> 01:31:10.885
Cynthia.

01:31:10.887 --> 01:31:13.022
Come here. Come here!

01:31:13.024 --> 01:31:14.025
Fuck!

01:31:24.068 --> 01:31:25.103
Get up. Georgia, get up.

01:31:28.273 --> 01:31:29.607
Open this.
Here, open this.

01:31:30.908 --> 01:31:32.377
You next, Priest!

01:31:35.981 --> 01:31:38.715
I'm gonna box them in.

01:31:38.717 --> 01:31:40.585
All right? You go
from that side.

01:31:43.821 --> 01:31:44.822
Come on.

01:31:48.260 --> 01:31:49.361
Fuck!

01:31:53.299 --> 01:31:54.819
- Come on!
- I'm here!

01:31:58.671 --> 01:31:59.838
Nah, nigga!

01:32:08.948 --> 01:32:10.615
- Come on! Come on!
- I can't do that.

01:32:10.617 --> 01:32:12.153
- That's fire.
- You pussy!

01:33:11.347 --> 01:33:12.382
Come on!

01:33:47.619 --> 01:33:50.059
- No, no, no, no, no! Watch out!
- I got it! I got it!

01:33:53.391 --> 01:33:54.592
Shit!

01:34:09.274 --> 01:34:10.409
Oh, shit!

01:34:20.821 --> 01:34:21.923
I'mma kill this bitch.

01:34:31.832 --> 01:34:33.231
Grab my gun.
I'm gonna come around.

01:34:33.233 --> 01:34:34.993
You shoot out the windshield
so he can't see.

01:34:38.839 --> 01:34:39.875
Now!

01:34:42.175 --> 01:34:44.011
What the fuck?

01:35:14.309 --> 01:35:18.981
I pray to God I don't remember
anything about this day.

01:35:18.983 --> 01:35:22.551
I keep thinking about Cynthia's
last moment before she...

01:35:24.253 --> 01:35:26.723
She must have
been so scared.

01:35:30.961 --> 01:35:32.227
I'm sorry.

01:35:33.663 --> 01:35:34.664
For all this.

01:35:46.644 --> 01:35:48.411
What are we
gonna do now?

01:35:53.018 --> 01:35:54.019
I don't know.

01:36:01.258 --> 01:36:02.560
Scatter was right.

01:36:03.728 --> 01:36:04.897
This is all on me.

01:36:15.607 --> 01:36:16.808
Today's a rainy day.

01:36:21.246 --> 01:36:22.612
It's time to use it.

01:36:22.614 --> 01:36:25.615
If we do this,
there's no going back.

01:36:25.617 --> 01:36:26.719
There never was.

01:36:50.409 --> 01:36:52.412
Hands up!
Get your hands up!

01:36:59.386 --> 01:37:02.022
He's in the city
or out the city somewhere.

01:37:02.024 --> 01:37:03.924
Call your people, and go
put a hole in this nigga.

01:37:03.926 --> 01:37:05.290
I don't care if we got to
leave the whole damn country.

01:37:05.292 --> 01:37:06.759
- Do you hear me?
- I hear you.

01:37:06.761 --> 01:37:08.281
- Do you hear me?
- I hear you. Yo, Ju.

01:37:09.731 --> 01:37:11.833
I think our boy has something
he wants to tell you.

01:37:13.568 --> 01:37:15.868
Look at this fucking crib.

01:37:15.871 --> 01:37:18.604
- It's nice, huh? I know that.
- Yeah, this motherfucker nice.

01:37:18.606 --> 01:37:20.740
Yeah,
this is all me now.

01:37:20.742 --> 01:37:22.777
Oh, yeah. I like.

01:37:24.545 --> 01:37:27.115
What the fuck
do you want, nigga?

01:37:27.117 --> 01:37:28.118
Talk!

01:37:30.053 --> 01:37:31.886
I want to join
the winning team.

01:37:31.888 --> 01:37:35.288
Get the fuck
out here! Now!

01:37:35.290 --> 01:37:36.757
- Step back!
- Now, boy!

01:37:36.759 --> 01:37:38.926
- Don't move!
- Don't move, nigga.

01:37:38.928 --> 01:37:40.661
This what the
winning team look like.

01:37:40.663 --> 01:37:42.663
You switching up
on your boy Priest so quick?

01:37:42.665 --> 01:37:44.533
Priest ain't my boy,
not no more.

01:37:45.467 --> 01:37:47.300
Them days over.

01:37:47.302 --> 01:37:48.638
Priest still in town?

01:37:50.141 --> 01:37:51.142
Yeah.

01:37:52.475 --> 01:37:54.709
And he trying
to make a move.

01:37:54.711 --> 01:37:56.680
But he gonna need
some money to do it.

01:37:58.448 --> 01:38:00.152
I know where
the money is.

01:38:02.452 --> 01:38:05.488
I mean, I could tell you, but, you
know, I need some guarantees.

01:38:18.202 --> 01:38:19.762
All right,
well, let's go get him.

01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:07.021
Yo, Priest!

01:39:09.189 --> 01:39:10.190
Priest!

01:39:13.928 --> 01:39:15.848
- Don't move!
- Don't move!

01:39:33.581 --> 01:39:35.781
- Cease fire, cease fire!
- Clear!

01:39:37.786 --> 01:39:39.418
Nice work, boys.

01:39:54.770 --> 01:39:55.771
Hello?

01:39:57.506 --> 01:39:58.506
It's done.

01:40:00.843 --> 01:40:02.676
Yeah.

01:40:02.678 --> 01:40:05.149
We ain't got to worry
about Sno Patrol no more.

01:40:06.315 --> 01:40:07.316
Good.

01:40:09.318 --> 01:40:12.419
Welcome,
citizens of this great city.

01:40:12.421 --> 01:40:15.690
Just like I told you all
when you elected me mayor,

01:40:15.692 --> 01:40:17.525
we would be creating
these community centers,

01:40:17.527 --> 01:40:19.527
and I'm proud
to open another one.

01:40:19.529 --> 01:40:21.629
Thank you.
God bless Atlanta.

01:40:21.631 --> 01:40:24.002
Don't forget
to get out and vote.

01:40:26.004 --> 01:40:28.336
Mr. Mayor, you mind
if I get a selfie with you?

01:40:28.338 --> 01:40:30.172
Well, of course.

01:40:30.174 --> 01:40:32.142
- Yes, sir.
<i>- Party time.</i>

01:40:32.144 --> 01:40:34.344
<i>- Let's get it. Let's get it.
- Hello, Mr. Mayor.</i>

01:40:35.313 --> 01:40:36.379
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

01:40:37.315 --> 01:40:39.149
<i>God damn! Let's go!</i>

01:40:39.151 --> 01:40:41.550
<i>ATL, ho! Let's go!</i>

01:40:41.552 --> 01:40:44.520
- It's pretty good, right?
- What you want, man?

01:40:44.522 --> 01:40:47.823
I want a few things. I want
you to make some calls.

01:40:47.825 --> 01:40:50.895
I want you to pull some
strings, get me a file.

01:40:50.897 --> 01:40:52.494
Do that, I won't just
give you this video.

01:40:52.496 --> 01:40:54.698
- I'll give you something else.
- What's that?

01:40:54.700 --> 01:40:55.701
The election.

01:41:15.454 --> 01:41:18.357
Informed on
your own brother...

01:41:18.359 --> 01:41:20.158
...you're worse than a rat.

01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:23.394
Worse than any creature that
has walked on this Earth.

01:41:23.396 --> 01:41:25.663
It's lies!
This is fake document!

01:41:26.968 --> 01:41:30.568
Please don't call this
fake news.

01:41:30.570 --> 01:41:33.537
You've been spending
too much time in America.

01:41:33.539 --> 01:41:35.374
Mama...

01:41:35.376 --> 01:41:36.708
I did it for the sake
of the family, mama!

01:41:36.710 --> 01:41:38.677
I did it for us!

01:41:38.679 --> 01:41:40.846
For the family? That's crap.

01:41:40.848 --> 01:41:45.885
Augustin is a pain in the ass and
occasionally stupid, very stupid.

01:41:45.887 --> 01:41:50.522
But he never ratted on the
family when he went to prison.

01:41:50.524 --> 01:41:53.558
I would have respected you
more if you killed him.

01:41:55.363 --> 01:41:57.730
Mama, don't do this! Please!
Please!

01:41:57.732 --> 01:42:00.100
...I beg you! I'm your son!

01:42:00.102 --> 01:42:01.834
No, you WERE my son.

01:42:03.940 --> 01:42:07.207
At one time we shared
the same blood.

01:42:07.209 --> 01:42:09.911
And now you will become...?

01:42:09.913 --> 01:42:11.711
No! No!

01:42:13.448 --> 01:42:16.185
...whatever it is this fucking
machine turns you into.

01:42:17.087 --> 01:42:19.120
No! No!

01:42:19.122 --> 01:42:21.923
You fucking asshole! No!

01:42:21.925 --> 01:42:24.326
No! Mama!

01:42:24.328 --> 01:42:26.162
Mommy!

01:42:26.164 --> 01:42:27.331
Fuck!

01:43:14.645 --> 01:43:17.781
Yo, Priest.
Where you at?

01:43:17.783 --> 01:43:20.451
- <i>It's payday.</i>
- I'm on my way.

01:43:20.453 --> 01:43:21.953
You better be after what
I just did for you.

01:43:21.955 --> 01:43:23.921
Well, for us, actually.

01:43:23.923 --> 01:43:26.357
I mean, we are
partners, right?

01:43:26.359 --> 01:43:28.160
You hear me?

01:43:28.162 --> 01:43:29.860
Sno Patrol, done.

01:43:29.862 --> 01:43:31.262
Took care
of your little problem.

01:43:31.264 --> 01:43:34.367
Nah. I take care
of my own problems.

01:43:35.002 --> 01:43:37.303
Priest? Hello?

01:43:40.107 --> 01:43:41.207
Motherfucker.

01:43:51.318 --> 01:43:53.519
- Freeze! Don't move!
- Stay right there!

01:43:53.521 --> 01:43:55.155
Stop! Put your hands up!

01:43:55.157 --> 01:43:57.077
- Atlanta PD!
- Don't move!

01:44:09.703 --> 01:44:11.538
<i>On
Wednesday, a dramatic arrest</i>

01:44:11.540 --> 01:44:13.908
<i>occurred downtown
of a career detective</i>

01:44:13.910 --> 01:44:16.376
<i>in the Atlanta
Police Department.</i>

01:44:16.378 --> 01:44:19.513
<i>With this and the recent takedown
of the local drug ring Sno Patrol,</i>

01:44:19.515 --> 01:44:22.883
<i>polling indicates that Mayor
Atkins has a six-point lead</i>

01:44:22.885 --> 01:44:26.753
<i>over all other candidates and is
expected to run away with the election.</i>

01:44:26.755 --> 01:44:28.889
<i>He made
the following statement.</i>

01:44:28.891 --> 01:44:30.757
<i>When
I was first elected,</i>

01:44:30.759 --> 01:44:33.693
<i>I promised to weed out
corruption in the Atlanta PD.</i>

01:44:33.695 --> 01:44:37.966
<i>I'm a man of God and a man of my word,
and I look forward to continue guiding</i>

01:44:37.968 --> 01:44:40.267
<i>this fine city of Atlanta
towards the light</i>

01:44:40.269 --> 01:44:42.573
<i>of a bright
and prosperous future.</i>

01:45:13.304 --> 01:45:15.538
Surprised you made it
with all this heat.

01:45:15.540 --> 01:45:18.075
Nothing gonna keep me
from my money.

01:45:18.077 --> 01:45:20.077
You're not nervous?

01:45:20.079 --> 01:45:22.146
I made a few phone calls.

01:45:22.148 --> 01:45:23.748
They ain't got shit on me.

01:45:24.450 --> 01:45:26.083
I'm a hero.

01:45:26.085 --> 01:45:28.585
Mayor himself said so.

01:45:28.587 --> 01:45:31.288
See, he can't have me
looking dirty,

01:45:31.290 --> 01:45:34.092
especially when
there's an election at stake.

01:45:34.094 --> 01:45:35.095
Let's go.

01:45:44.404 --> 01:45:45.838
What the fuck?

01:45:49.309 --> 01:45:52.510
Oh, shit. No, no, no.
No, no, no.

01:45:52.512 --> 01:45:54.445
All right, hold on, chill.
Chill the fuck out.

01:45:54.447 --> 01:45:55.613
Let's talk this through.

01:45:55.615 --> 01:45:57.151
Oh, like how you
talked to Freddie?

01:46:04.425 --> 01:46:06.627
- Come on, man.
- Motherfucker.

01:46:29.717 --> 01:46:30.884
No, no, no.

01:46:30.886 --> 01:46:32.751
No, no, no.
Fuck, man. Stop.

01:46:32.753 --> 01:46:34.221
No, no, no.

01:47:37.289 --> 01:47:39.957
<i>The dream
was always to get out.</i>

01:47:39.959 --> 01:47:42.460
<i>I just didn't know
how far I'd have to go.</i>

01:47:43.862 --> 01:47:45.297
How do you feel?

01:47:46.032 --> 01:47:47.263
Right now?

01:47:47.265 --> 01:47:48.301
Mmm-hmm.

01:47:49.902 --> 01:47:50.903
Free.

01:47:52.872 --> 01:47:54.806
You think you're
gonna miss home?

01:47:55.909 --> 01:47:57.408
Come on, now.

01:47:57.410 --> 01:47:58.577
I am home.

01:48:00.579 --> 01:48:02.415
Besides, we can
always go back.

01:48:04.151 --> 01:48:07.152
Okay, baby, smile.

01:48:12.926 --> 01:48:14.426
Look.

01:48:14.428 --> 01:48:15.826
Tell him I said hi.

01:48:15.828 --> 01:48:18.330
- My brother.
<i>- My brother.</i>

01:48:18.332 --> 01:48:20.198
You know you're
missing out, now.

01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:22.867
I know, but...

01:48:22.869 --> 01:48:25.337
You know, that's all you.
That never was me.

01:48:25.339 --> 01:48:27.272
Well, there's always a spot
out here if you ever need it.

01:48:27.274 --> 01:48:28.507
I mean that.

01:48:28.509 --> 01:48:30.378
Oh, for sure. For sure.

01:48:32.113 --> 01:48:33.214
Till the re-up, baby.

01:48:34.315 --> 01:48:35.483
Till the re-up.

01:48:36.284 --> 01:48:37.450
Peace.

01:48:37.452 --> 01:48:39.019
Got to make
this money, man.

01:48:39.021 --> 01:48:40.022
A'ight.

01:48:42.390 --> 01:48:43.790
Who want their
shot at the king?

01:48:43.792 --> 01:48:44.857
Let's go, baby.

01:48:44.859 --> 01:48:45.994
Hand me the crown!

01:48:47.228 --> 01:48:49.529
<i>Yeah, I left America.</i>

01:48:49.531 --> 01:48:52.666
<i>But I damn sure took the
dream with me, didn't I?</i>

01:48:52.668 --> 01:48:55.302
<i>And that's superfly.</i>
