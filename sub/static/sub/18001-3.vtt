00:13.352 --> 00:15.191
Man, you know what's fatiguing?

00:15.225 --> 00:17.165
Giving the fake laugh, man.

00:17.200 --> 00:19.505
Customer service means you
got to give the fake laugh

00:19.539 --> 00:21.876
at least 60 to 70 times a day.

00:21.910 --> 00:24.084
You're just, like, fake
laughing nonstop all day?

00:24.118 --> 00:26.155
You can't tell when I'm
fake laughing, you guys?

00:26.189 --> 00:28.592
I just assume you're always
fake laughing at me, so...

00:28.627 --> 00:29.695
Correct assumption.

00:29.733 --> 00:31.469
[Laughter]

00:31.504 --> 00:33.473
There is nothing worse than the fake laugh.

00:33.507 --> 00:36.313
Getting a fake orgasm,
that's got to feel worse.

00:36.348 --> 00:37.149
<i>Getting a fake one?</i>

00:37.183 --> 00:38.653
No, like, if a woman tells you...

00:38.687 --> 00:40.326
Oh, my God, how would
I... how would I know?

00:40.361 --> 00:41.361
Are you saying that you may not have

00:41.395 --> 00:43.998
100% success rate with the missus?

00:44.032 --> 00:46.237
- In... in the bed?
- No, it's definitely 100%.

00:46.271 --> 00:47.844
You couldn't tell I was fake laughing!

00:47.878 --> 00:49.313
That's different.

the only show that's suitable for children

01:40.201 --> 01:42.537
Gentlemen, what has been
going on in the great state

01:42.572 --> 01:43.706
of New Jersey this week?

01:43.740 --> 01:45.742
Last week, a guy came in,

01:45.776 --> 01:48.883
a guy who I definitively
made a connection with.

01:55.630 --> 01:57.199
- Hi.
- Hey, man. How you doing?

01:57.233 --> 02:00.007
My name's Gary, and I've got
some books I want to show you,

02:00.041 --> 02:01.843
a piece of comic book history.

02:01.879 --> 02:03.714
- All right.
- Boom.

02:03.748 --> 02:05.185
Wow.

02:05.220 --> 02:07.126
<i>- X-Men 1.
- You're right, man.</i>

02:07.160 --> 02:08.997
- That is history.
- You want to see another one?

02:09.032 --> 02:10.167
I'd love to see another one.

02:10.201 --> 02:11.838
<i>Fantastic Four number 1.</i>

02:11.875 --> 02:13.310
Oh, my God, man.

02:13.344 --> 02:14.913
This ushers in the Marvel age, right?

02:14.947 --> 02:16.982
- That's right.
- Go ahead, what else you got?

02:17.017 --> 02:19.287
<i>- Avengers number 1.
- Oh, God.</i>

02:19.321 --> 02:22.760
- You have even more than this?
- Wait till you see this.

02:22.794 --> 02:25.969
<i>Amazing Spider-Man numero uno,</i>

02:26.003 --> 02:29.876
<i>and last but not least,
Fantastic Four number 48,</i>

02:29.910 --> 02:31.945
as you know, the first
appearance of silver surfer.

02:31.979 --> 02:34.010
A piece of Marvel history here.

02:40.648 --> 02:42.181
- Gary.
- Yes?

02:42.215 --> 02:44.515
You've just made our nerdgasm pop.

02:44.550 --> 02:45.682
[Laughter]

02:45.717 --> 02:47.552
Mine pops all the time, you know?

02:47.587 --> 02:48.687
I can understand.

02:48.721 --> 02:50.121
These are a big deal?

02:50.155 --> 02:52.655
- These are...
- The big deal.

02:52.689 --> 02:54.623
This is what spawned a universe.

02:54.658 --> 02:56.892
This is what spawned a juggernaut.

02:56.926 --> 02:58.326
<i>Fantastic Four, the Avengers,</i>

02:58.360 --> 03:01.095
<i>and the X-Men films all
trace back to right here, man.</i>

03:01.130 --> 03:02.230
Really?

03:02.264 --> 03:04.803
This one, probably, is without a doubt

03:04.838 --> 03:07.606
the most important comic
book in Marvel Comics history.

03:07.641 --> 03:08.709
- Right?
- For sure.

03:08.743 --> 03:10.846
I mean, without the Fantastic Four,

03:10.881 --> 03:12.516
is there a Marvel comics?

03:12.550 --> 03:14.152
No, this is the book.

03:14.186 --> 03:16.055
I mean, it's great stuff.

03:16.090 --> 03:18.893
It was comic book history
on the secret stash counter.

03:18.927 --> 03:20.061
Dude, it was almost him

03:20.096 --> 03:21.796
and Gary on the secret stash counter.

03:21.831 --> 03:24.331
[Laughter]

03:24.365 --> 03:26.099
We definitely were on the same wavelength.

03:26.133 --> 03:27.934
We love the same things about comics.

03:27.968 --> 03:30.704
I really, really, you know...

03:30.738 --> 03:32.505
Want to marry him?

03:32.539 --> 03:35.742
[Laughter]

03:35.776 --> 03:38.177
Gary, where'd you get these at?

03:38.212 --> 03:41.379
Well, when I was 15 years
of age, I loved comics,

03:41.413 --> 03:43.949
and I loved them so much, I
started buying collections.

03:43.984 --> 03:45.985
I bought them with my bar mitzvah money,

03:46.019 --> 03:48.819
and ever since then, I've been
buying and selling comic books

03:48.853 --> 03:49.887
for a career.

03:49.922 --> 03:52.024
You know, I have 800,000 comics now.

03:52.059 --> 03:53.558
- 800,000?
- Yes.

03:53.592 --> 03:55.927
I'm a dealer, but I'm
also a collector first.

03:55.961 --> 03:57.262
You're a lover as well, I assume?

03:57.296 --> 03:58.431
Oh, yeah. That's for sure.

03:58.465 --> 04:01.166
- I have a wife...
- Well, I meant... I meant...

04:01.200 --> 04:03.537
nice work. Right.

04:03.572 --> 04:05.141
I meant lover of the art form.

04:05.176 --> 04:06.408
I know. I'm just jive talking.

04:06.442 --> 04:07.407
But, yeah, this is wonderful stuff.

04:07.442 --> 04:08.443
You can't tell he's jive...

04:08.477 --> 04:10.950
- No.
- Slap him.

04:10.984 --> 04:13.253
All right, gar, how much you think

04:13.287 --> 04:15.087
is sitting up on the counter right now?

04:15.122 --> 04:17.622
I'd say 11 grand at least.

04:17.656 --> 04:21.524
<i>The X-Men 1 is the prince.
I want 3,500 for this one.</i>

04:21.559 --> 04:23.026
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:23.060 --> 04:26.194
It's now known as the artist
formerly known as prince.

04:26.229 --> 04:28.395
[Laughter]

04:28.430 --> 04:31.934
All right, I'm gonna go after one of these.

04:31.968 --> 04:34.571
<i>I think it's gonna be Fantastic Four 48.</i>

04:34.605 --> 04:37.906
Okay, that sounds good. 275.

04:37.940 --> 04:40.244
Could you do any better than 275?

04:40.278 --> 04:42.148
175, maybe?

04:42.182 --> 04:44.415
Ah, no!

04:48.019 --> 04:50.256
I'll do 225, bottom.

04:50.291 --> 04:53.457
Come on, gar. 200?

04:53.491 --> 04:56.663
Are you... did I have
$75 worth of fun today?

04:56.697 --> 04:58.496
What the Heck?

04:58.531 --> 05:01.634
- You'll do it?
- You got it.

05:01.668 --> 05:02.971
- Here you go.
- Why, thank you, sir.

05:03.005 --> 05:04.505
And I get to keep these lovelies?

05:04.540 --> 05:06.706
- Those are now keepsies.
- I love them.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.307
Isn't that the best thing about comics?

05:08.342 --> 05:09.443
- It is.
- All right, Gary.

05:09.477 --> 05:11.711
- You too.
- Awesome dude, man.

05:15.948 --> 05:18.948
[Laughter]

05:20.849 --> 05:22.715
Oh, here he is.

05:22.749 --> 05:24.053
What's so funny, man?

05:24.087 --> 05:25.754
It's like the catskills back here, dude.

05:25.789 --> 05:27.820
I don't even... I don't even
come here to buy comics anymore.

05:27.855 --> 05:31.120
I just come here to, like,
get a few chuckles and...

05:31.154 --> 05:33.754
Yuk-yuks back here in the...
in the old back of the shop.

05:33.789 --> 05:35.957
Ah, Brian Quinn, ladies and gentlemen,

05:35.991 --> 05:40.795
is a co-host with Walter
and Bryan on their podcast,

05:40.829 --> 05:44.331
<i>tell 'em Steve-Dave!, and
a TV star in his own right.</i>

05:44.365 --> 05:45.565
Him and his buddies have a show

05:45.600 --> 05:48.232
<i>called impractical jokers on TruTV.</i>

05:48.267 --> 05:50.732
Guys sound like you're
having a great time back here.

05:50.767 --> 05:51.767
Yeah, we are.

05:51.802 --> 05:53.537
All the shirts have been restocked?

05:53.571 --> 05:56.071
All the reorders have been
put in at diamond, yeah?

05:56.106 --> 05:58.407
Yeah, yeah, everything's
done. What's with you?

05:58.441 --> 05:59.742
At this point, why don't you guys

05:59.776 --> 06:01.846
- just do stand-up here, right?
- [Scoffs]

06:01.880 --> 06:03.846
Oh, my God, do you know
how much I would pay

06:03.880 --> 06:05.212
to watch these guys do stand-up?

06:05.246 --> 06:06.779
Come on. It's not that hard.

06:06.813 --> 06:08.912
You think you could go up onstage

06:08.946 --> 06:10.445
and make an audience laugh?

06:10.480 --> 06:12.279
Absolutely, I could. Come on.

06:12.313 --> 06:13.815
Can we find an open mic night?

06:13.849 --> 06:15.584
Dude, let's just have it here. All right?

06:15.619 --> 06:17.919
I should just put an open
mic here and have you guys

06:17.954 --> 06:19.887
go up there and tell your best material.

06:19.921 --> 06:21.921
- Are you serious?
- I'm not kidding around, man.

06:21.956 --> 06:23.556
How awesome would that be, huh?

06:23.590 --> 06:25.120
Comedy night at the stash.

06:25.155 --> 06:26.921
We turn this place into a comedy club.

06:26.955 --> 06:28.390
You go up there.

06:28.425 --> 06:30.228
We tell some jokes for people,
make it a little competition.

06:30.262 --> 06:32.531
Let's see who the biggest yukster is

06:32.566 --> 06:33.766
out of you chuckleheads.

06:33.801 --> 06:34.969
I don't want to tell jokes.

06:35.004 --> 06:36.638
I want to, like... I
want to emcee the night.

06:36.672 --> 06:38.674
Oh, dude, that would
be awesome, right, huh?

06:38.708 --> 06:40.913
Brian Quinn, emcee.

06:40.947 --> 06:42.181
[Laughter]

06:42.215 --> 06:45.284
Why don't you do comic book related jokes?

06:45.318 --> 06:47.084
- That's a good idea.
- I would totally do that.

06:47.118 --> 06:48.518
Next week, you guys all up for this?

06:48.553 --> 06:49.653
- You all in?
- Yeah.

06:49.687 --> 06:51.824
- I'm in.
- It's gonna be awesome.

06:51.858 --> 06:53.828
Think I got something you
might be interested in.

06:53.862 --> 06:55.127
Absolutely, man.

06:55.162 --> 06:58.632
Oh, look at that, huh?
The O.G. Missing link.

07:03.624 --> 07:04.689
<i>What's going on, guys?</i>

07:04.724 --> 07:05.959
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hey.

07:05.993 --> 07:07.529
Think I got something you
might be interested in.

07:07.564 --> 07:08.631
Oh, absolutely.

07:08.665 --> 07:11.166
Always interested in a universal monster.

07:17.704 --> 07:19.204
Remember this guy, huh?

07:19.238 --> 07:22.707
The gill-man, creature
from the black lagoon,

07:22.742 --> 07:26.773
the O.G. Missing link
between man and dinosaur.

07:26.807 --> 07:29.944
Oh, yeah, and he was the last
of the great universal monsters.

07:29.978 --> 07:33.310
That's the Remco 1980 doll.

07:33.345 --> 07:35.881
So mego at this point,
when this figure's produced,

07:35.915 --> 07:37.184
has shut the doors...

07:37.218 --> 07:38.452
Done.

07:38.487 --> 07:41.454
Then Remco gets the
universal monster license.

07:41.488 --> 07:42.822
Eh, it's hard

07:42.856 --> 07:44.992
to be terrifying when you've
got your baggy pajamas on.

07:45.026 --> 07:47.460
They call him the pajama party gill man.

07:47.494 --> 07:49.195
[Laughter]

07:49.229 --> 07:52.163
What I love about you is,
you're still carrying a flag

07:52.197 --> 07:54.129
for these dopey-ass monsters

07:54.163 --> 07:56.065
that scare nobody anymore, man,

07:56.099 --> 07:59.335
still carrying it as ardently
as people who are like,

07:59.369 --> 08:00.835
"the south will rise again."

08:00.869 --> 08:02.971
Like, you still believe big-time

08:03.005 --> 08:04.473
in the universal monsters, man.

08:04.507 --> 08:06.307
[Laughter]

08:06.342 --> 08:08.240
Is this bad boy the top of the food chain?

08:08.274 --> 08:10.574
Is there anything he
can't take down in the sea?

08:10.608 --> 08:11.576
Take down in the sea

08:11.610 --> 08:13.779
or take down in a lagoon where he lives,

08:13.813 --> 08:18.346
which is basically like
a hillbilly watering hole?

08:18.381 --> 08:22.013
What are... what are his
natural enemies, like, frogs?

08:22.048 --> 08:23.383
Some tropical fish.

08:23.417 --> 08:24.818
- A turtle?
- Yeah, there...

08:24.853 --> 08:26.221
there's, like, hardly anything

08:26.255 --> 08:27.322
he has to really prove himself against.

08:27.356 --> 08:29.323
I disagree, man. Look at those claws.

08:29.357 --> 08:31.391
Look at... even his toes are claws.

08:31.426 --> 08:32.894
Look at those teeth.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.361
Is there any other universal monster

08:34.397 --> 08:37.895
that could take him down
if he was to go Mano a Mano?

08:37.928 --> 08:39.928
Well, definitely not in the water.

08:39.962 --> 08:41.363
- If he's in the water...
- Right.

08:41.398 --> 08:42.866
- No universal monster...
- I mean, Dracula with the...

08:42.900 --> 08:44.467
- Nah, no question.
- Dracula with the cape?

08:44.501 --> 08:46.632
Weighed down, right to the
bottom of the ocean floor.

08:46.667 --> 08:47.833
- He tears him apart.
- Exactly.

08:47.867 --> 08:50.137
Frankenstein, the big, big boots,

08:50.171 --> 08:51.304
- sinks right to the bottom.
- Right.

08:51.338 --> 08:54.874
- The wolf
- Man... dogs can't swim.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.009
- Yeah.
- Dogs...

08:56.044 --> 08:57.378
okay.

08:57.412 --> 08:59.179
I mean, I don't know if
they can fight in water,

08:59.213 --> 09:02.447
but they can swim in water.

09:02.482 --> 09:03.515
Do you remember the story

09:03.550 --> 09:04.750
<i>of the creature from the black lagoon?</i>

09:04.785 --> 09:06.916
Is it a story of, like, man gone wrong,

09:06.950 --> 09:08.717
or is he literally a monster from the jump?

09:08.752 --> 09:09.885
He's just a missing link.

09:09.920 --> 09:11.154
He's... he's a creature

09:11.188 --> 09:13.990
that survived the extinction
from the dinosaurs.

09:14.024 --> 09:16.492
He kind of is stuck in that lagoon.

09:16.526 --> 09:18.026
I mean, I don't know. Have
you ever seen a lagoon?

09:18.060 --> 09:19.593
- I haven't.
- They're not big.

09:19.628 --> 09:20.929
A lagoon is kind of like, what,

09:20.963 --> 09:22.731
a larger version of a lake essentially?

09:22.765 --> 09:24.564
Like, you could drain
it like that and be like,

09:24.599 --> 09:25.565
"there he is."

09:25.600 --> 09:29.469
[Laughter]

09:29.504 --> 09:30.937
So you're looking to sell it today?

09:30.971 --> 09:32.605
- I am looking to sell.
- How come?

09:32.639 --> 09:34.908
Well, I'm doing some kitchen renovations

09:34.942 --> 09:37.544
and kind of need the money.

09:37.579 --> 09:39.647
My wife wants a new stove.

09:39.682 --> 09:41.282
This would help pay for the new stove.

09:41.316 --> 09:42.783
What are you looking to get for it?

09:42.817 --> 09:44.885
- Ah, 250.
- 250?

09:44.921 --> 09:46.055
Yeah.

09:46.089 --> 09:48.457
Mm, that's a little high, you know.

09:48.491 --> 09:49.957
I mean, I don't know if you noticed...

09:49.992 --> 09:52.260
- The buckle's broken on the back.
- Right.

09:52.294 --> 09:55.030
The arm feels like it's
about ready to give.

09:55.064 --> 09:57.798
Pajamas got a rip right
there in the inseam.

09:57.832 --> 09:58.798
Yeah.

09:58.833 --> 10:01.670
But the biggest factor is no box.

10:01.704 --> 10:05.277
I mean, would you go...
willing to part with it for 150?

10:05.311 --> 10:08.079
You know, maybe you're not
getting a top-of-the-line stove.

10:08.113 --> 10:10.146
Maybe you're just getting a hot plate,

10:10.180 --> 10:13.017
but, you know, you can
still make some soup.

10:13.052 --> 10:16.522
Uh, I would do, like, 225.

10:16.557 --> 10:18.524
225.

10:18.559 --> 10:19.995
Got to hit at least in the...

10:20.030 --> 10:22.067
in the 200 range here.

10:22.101 --> 10:25.068
175.

10:25.103 --> 10:27.339
- No?
- Can't do it for... can't do it.

10:27.373 --> 10:29.942
Man, I'm gonna have to let him go, man.

10:29.977 --> 10:33.179
Back to the lagoon with you.

10:33.214 --> 10:34.748
- Worth a shot, though.
- All right, man.

10:34.783 --> 10:36.049
I appreciate you bringing it in.

10:36.083 --> 10:37.250
Thanks, man. Appreciate it.

10:37.284 --> 10:38.849
- Thanks, guys.
- Take care.

10:38.884 --> 10:40.715
- Dude.
- Good luck.

10:40.749 --> 10:44.286
Thank you.

10:44.320 --> 10:46.286
It's always the toughest
part of the game, man.

10:46.320 --> 10:47.587
You think you threw your line in,

10:47.621 --> 10:49.820
and you're gonna pull up a gill-man.

10:49.855 --> 10:52.321
Just pulled up a soggy, old, wet sock.

10:52.355 --> 10:54.355
[Laughter]

10:55.424 --> 10:57.259
Oh, wow.

10:57.293 --> 10:58.896
Whoa. This is awesome.

11:00.877 --> 11:04.714
Brian Quinn goes back to
the first view askew office,

11:04.749 --> 11:07.652
when he was the very first
assistant that we ever had.

11:07.687 --> 11:10.692
So this was the early days of
the view askew message board,

11:10.726 --> 11:13.193
and Brian used to post
on it, so Quinn was like,

11:13.228 --> 11:15.026
"I went into the store
to get a Mallrats book,"

11:15.060 --> 11:16.158
"and the dude told me"

11:16.193 --> 11:19.496
"that your movies stink,"
and I said, "all right."

11:19.531 --> 11:20.964
"Well, you go back, and you give"

11:20.999 --> 11:23.867
"that bookstore dork some [Bleep]."

11:23.902 --> 11:25.002
He literally went

11:25.036 --> 11:27.838
and did it, man, and
he sent us an audio tape

11:27.872 --> 11:30.771
of him attacking the
bookstore clerk verbally

11:30.805 --> 11:32.772
so he goes back, and you hear him go like,

11:32.806 --> 11:33.940
"you remember me?

11:33.975 --> 11:35.210
You remember I bought
a book here last week?"

11:35.244 --> 11:36.878
And the guy's like, "yeah, I guess."

11:36.912 --> 11:38.745
And he's just like,
"well, I told Kevin Smith,

11:38.779 --> 11:41.350
"and he told me to give the bookstore dork

11:41.385 --> 11:43.887
some [Bleep]!" Like...

11:43.922 --> 11:45.154
So right away, I was like,

11:45.189 --> 11:47.556
"anybody that does that
gets to work at view askew."

11:47.590 --> 11:49.258
[Laughter]

11:53.598 --> 11:55.599
[Horn honks]

12:00.036 --> 12:01.737
Oh, my God.

12:01.772 --> 12:03.340
Oh, wow.

12:03.374 --> 12:05.308
Whoa. This is awesome.

12:05.342 --> 12:07.008
- That does look great, man.
- That looks awesome.

12:07.044 --> 12:08.446
Great black widow costume.

12:08.480 --> 12:10.217
You should have went the full 10 yards

12:10.251 --> 12:11.651
and got the red wig, though, right?

12:11.686 --> 12:13.283
Tell me you didn't just say black widow.

12:13.318 --> 12:15.652
<i>Seriously? It's the baroness from G.I. Joe.</i>

12:15.687 --> 12:17.389
Well, I got to ask, so why
are you dressed like this?

12:17.423 --> 12:18.990
This is actually something

12:19.024 --> 12:21.959
to inspire you to buy something off me,

12:21.993 --> 12:25.528
and that is a baroness on card.

12:25.563 --> 12:27.063
- It's 1984.
- Oh.

12:27.098 --> 12:28.665
All right, now we're talking.

12:36.070 --> 12:38.939
Step back. Let me see your costume here.

12:38.974 --> 12:41.379
It's like she... it's like she
just walked out of the card.

12:41.413 --> 12:42.948
Excellent job, my friend.

12:42.982 --> 12:44.250
In the whole G.I. Joe world,

12:44.284 --> 12:46.485
there were like, what, maybe three females?

12:46.520 --> 12:47.886
- Yeah, yeah.
- There was Scarlett.

12:47.920 --> 12:49.952
There was Lady Jaye, and
then there's the baroness.

12:49.987 --> 12:51.354
You know, everybody had to have it.

12:51.388 --> 12:52.789
Now, you didn't have, like, a crush

12:52.823 --> 12:54.491
on any of the female
characters of the cast?

12:54.525 --> 12:56.525
Come on. Come on.

12:56.560 --> 12:59.798
Did I have a crush on a
3 1/2 inch plastic toy?

12:59.832 --> 13:01.533
- Oh.
- Your wife does.

13:01.567 --> 13:04.567
[Laughter]

13:06.406 --> 13:08.908
She was the best out of all
of them, though, if you ask me.

13:08.942 --> 13:10.275
I'm a big cobra fan,

13:10.309 --> 13:13.346
so I don't concentrate
on the G.I. Joes as much.

13:13.380 --> 13:14.513
I like that.

13:14.547 --> 13:15.981
The characters were much more interesting.

13:16.015 --> 13:17.349
G.I. Joe was right in my wheelhouse.

13:17.383 --> 13:18.750
It was what I collected,
and I always thought

13:18.785 --> 13:20.351
the baroness was a badass character,

13:20.386 --> 13:22.222
and I was always a fan of the evil side.

13:22.256 --> 13:25.523
I always gravitated towards
evil for some reason.

13:25.558 --> 13:26.824
Is that really the kind of thing

13:26.858 --> 13:28.226
you want to admit to friends?

13:28.260 --> 13:31.329
"I was always gravitating toward evil.

13:31.363 --> 13:32.363
Cats went missing."

13:32.397 --> 13:35.267
[Laughter]

13:35.302 --> 13:36.635
Where did you get this?

13:36.669 --> 13:40.003
I got this at a Joe con several years back,

13:40.036 --> 13:42.771
but I need to sell it
for animal charities now.

13:42.805 --> 13:44.673
Cats that have diabetes and stuff,

13:44.708 --> 13:46.473
they don't get adopted out as easily,

13:46.508 --> 13:48.741
so I want to help out
with that any way I can.

13:48.775 --> 13:50.443
So the baroness has a heart then?

13:50.477 --> 13:51.777
I do, yeah.

13:51.812 --> 13:53.844
That's very admirable.
What do you want for this?

13:53.879 --> 13:55.810
Well, I was thinking 75.

13:55.844 --> 13:57.846
Well, what does it go for
on the aftermarket today?

13:57.880 --> 13:59.515
I mean, this is basically a loose figure.

13:59.549 --> 14:01.281
It's been out of the
packaging. It's ripped.

14:01.316 --> 14:02.783
On the plus side, it's un-punched.

14:02.818 --> 14:04.486
- Yeah. I noticed that. There's no...
- That's...

14:04.521 --> 14:06.557
That's big. This is a tough figure to find,

14:06.591 --> 14:09.393
so we could probably get
about 75 bucks for it.

14:09.427 --> 14:12.362
I mean, if we're gonna
go even close to that...

14:12.396 --> 14:13.364
$40.

14:13.398 --> 14:16.567
Come on, you P.O.S. Come on.

14:16.602 --> 14:17.902
This is about a... this is about a charity.

14:17.937 --> 14:19.305
This is to help kitties.

14:19.340 --> 14:21.008
- All right, how about this?
- You know what? You know what?

14:21.043 --> 14:23.345
Me, Bry, and zap here will put in 25,

14:23.379 --> 14:24.745
and then you don't have to worry

14:24.779 --> 14:27.315
about being taken advantage
of by the baroness.

14:27.349 --> 14:29.116
No, no, no. I'll throw some money in too.

14:29.150 --> 14:30.316
- All right.
- I'll throw in some money.

14:30.351 --> 14:31.450
You can throw in my 25.

14:31.485 --> 14:33.419
Fine.

14:33.453 --> 14:35.556
- Here, here you go.
- All right.

14:35.590 --> 14:38.028
- All right, baroness.
- Thank you, guys.

14:38.062 --> 14:39.531
- Thank you.
- Have fun helping the animals.

14:39.565 --> 14:41.201
I'll come out in my regular clothes later

14:41.235 --> 14:43.003
and see if you can guess who I am.

14:43.037 --> 14:44.838
- An annoying customer?
- Bye.

14:44.873 --> 14:46.205
[Laughter]

14:46.239 --> 14:47.306
Thank you, guys.

14:47.340 --> 14:49.844
Thank you. Keep doing the good work.

14:59.558 --> 15:00.925
So we deck the place out.

15:00.959 --> 15:02.260
It looks great,

15:02.294 --> 15:03.994
and then we actually fill the place up too.

15:04.028 --> 15:06.029
People were actually
interested in coming in and...

15:06.064 --> 15:07.498
- and checking it out.
- Did you charge?

15:07.532 --> 15:08.699
- Was it free?
- Well, it wasn't really free.

15:08.733 --> 15:11.671
It was a two comic book minimum.

genius, an American genius.

Well, well, well.

15:44.491 --> 15:46.427
Oh, super excited to be here.

- Oh, get out of here. Really?
- He works here on Sunday.

it ain't coming back.

17:09.602 --> 17:11.434
You know, the place is packed,

17:11.898 --> 17:13.935
and I'm starting to get
nervous for these guys,

17:13.970 --> 17:16.708
because I don't want to see them humiliated

17:16.742 --> 17:18.009
and throw 'em the wolves.

17:18.044 --> 17:19.679
You only put all these things

17:19.713 --> 17:21.914
in... in motion, and then at the zero hour,

17:21.949 --> 17:24.782
you're like, "oh, I hope it
doesn't hurt 'em that bad."

17:24.818 --> 17:26.085

17:26.118 --> 17:28.153
You did everything but sell tomatoes.

she's like, "you know what?

17:32.692 --> 17:35.529
"Everything you need to know
about a successful marriage

17:37.331 --> 17:39.498
You know, last time I
satisfied her, she sat back,

17:39.532 --> 17:42.470
and she's like, "where did
you get those wonderful toys?"

17:42.504 --> 17:44.905
[Laughter]

17:44.939 --> 17:47.040
- Finally.
- It kills every time.

17:47.074 --> 17:49.342
Why does Aquaman's wife
wear a seashell bra?

17:49.376 --> 17:50.812
[High-pitched] I have no idea.

17:50.846 --> 17:53.779
'Cause her boobies are too
big for a "b-shell" bra.

17:53.814 --> 17:56.982
That's why. [Rim shot]

17:57.016 --> 17:59.550
I saw that ming was here earlier tonight

17:59.584 --> 18:01.686
or, as his kids call
him, the invisible man.

18:01.721 --> 18:05.295
[Laughter]

18:05.329 --> 18:06.999
I didn't recognize what
that sound was at first,

18:07.034 --> 18:09.036
and I was like, "oh, my
God. That's laughing."

18:09.070 --> 18:12.776
[Laughter]

18:12.811 --> 18:13.810
Bryan's funny as hell.

18:13.845 --> 18:14.945
He is a funny guy,

18:14.979 --> 18:16.981
but I almost put all
my eggs in your basket,

18:17.015 --> 18:18.650
because what's in your wheelhouse

18:18.684 --> 18:19.719
if not comic books?

18:19.753 --> 18:21.456
- So I thought, like...
- Comedy.

18:21.490 --> 18:24.328
[Laughter]

18:24.362 --> 18:27.164
Like Walt Flanagan, I don't
like this cosplay craze.

18:27.198 --> 18:29.301
They say it's short for costume play,

18:29.335 --> 18:31.632
but I think it might really be short for:

18:31.666 --> 18:33.499
'Cause-I'm-a-socially-awkward-
nerd-with-no-friends-

18:33.533 --> 18:35.234
who-hates-their-own-existence-
so-much-

18:35.269 --> 18:37.437
it's-preferable-to-constantly-
pretend-I'm-anyone-but-myself

18:37.472 --> 18:40.073
play.

18:40.108 --> 18:42.777
Why is your voice so high-pitched?

18:42.812 --> 18:44.512
[High-pitched] 'Cause
your hand is up my butt.

18:44.514 --> 18:45.844
That's why.

18:45.878 --> 18:47.444
Anybody want to see an impression?

18:47.478 --> 18:49.177
Look, it's Spider-Man.

18:49.212 --> 18:51.180
Thwip, thwip, thwip, thwip, thwip.

18:51.214 --> 18:53.683
I'm Spider-Man. Thwip.

18:53.718 --> 18:54.918
That's all I got for you guys.

18:54.952 --> 18:57.122
You guys are beautiful.

18:57.156 --> 18:59.528
Now you know why they call
him ming the merciless.

18:59.562 --> 19:00.664
Thank you so much.

19:00.698 --> 19:02.868
All right, nice work. Nice work.

19:02.902 --> 19:06.042
Ah, God, you did great. You did great.

19:06.076 --> 19:09.544
All right, Bryan Johnson,
ladies and gentlemen.

19:09.578 --> 19:10.545
Give it up. Come on.

19:10.579 --> 19:11.814
Give it up for Bryan Johnson.

19:11.849 --> 19:13.250
[Cheers and applause]

19:13.285 --> 19:15.722
All right. Whoo!

19:15.756 --> 19:17.959
You killed it, buddy.

19:17.993 --> 19:19.461
I'd say you could quit your day job

19:19.495 --> 19:21.630
and get into comedy, but what day job?

19:21.665 --> 19:23.798
Ho! [Rim shot]

19:23.833 --> 19:26.102
It's everybody's favorite
time of the evening.

19:26.137 --> 19:29.675
It's when you guys get to judge
and pick who did the best job,

19:29.709 --> 19:32.914
so with no further ado, please welcome back

19:32.949 --> 19:35.585
to the stage Ming Chen, Michael Zapcic,

19:35.620 --> 19:36.587
and Bryan Johnson.

19:36.621 --> 19:37.955
Come on out, guys. Come on.

19:37.989 --> 19:40.991
[Cheers and applause]

19:42.927 --> 19:44.294
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,

19:44.328 --> 19:46.597
if you think that ming
chen did the best job,

19:46.631 --> 19:47.965
please applaud now.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.734
[Clapping]

19:49.768 --> 19:51.770
Oh, buddy.

19:51.804 --> 19:53.572
Really? Seriously?

19:53.606 --> 19:54.808
Ladies and gentlemen,

19:54.842 --> 19:57.077
if you think that Mike
and Vicky did the best job,

19:57.112 --> 19:58.212
please applaud now.

19:58.247 --> 20:00.115
[Cheering and applauding]

20:00.149 --> 20:01.450
All right.

20:01.484 --> 20:03.586
Ladies and gentlemen, please
put your hands together

20:03.620 --> 20:05.989
if you think that Bryan
Johnson did the best job.

20:06.023 --> 20:06.990
[Cheers and applause]

20:07.024 --> 20:08.391
There it is.

20:08.425 --> 20:10.994
Wow.

20:11.028 --> 20:12.963
I think Bryan wins.

20:12.998 --> 20:14.064
Wow.

20:14.098 --> 20:15.131
[Indistinct chatter]

20:15.166 --> 20:17.100
It's a trophy.

20:17.135 --> 20:18.970
[Cheers and applause]

20:19.004 --> 20:20.037
You still thought you had a chance

20:20.072 --> 20:21.205
while you were up there, didn't you?

20:21.239 --> 20:23.574
Yeah, yeah, and I heard his plane crash.

20:23.608 --> 20:26.378
I saw his train wreck.

20:26.412 --> 20:28.748
Even after you handed me
the cup, he thought he won.

20:28.782 --> 20:30.317
[Laughter]

20:30.351 --> 20:34.816
You had no idea that you
were the worst comic standing.

20:34.851 --> 20:37.150
I will say this, though. Major props.

20:37.185 --> 20:39.621
I mean, I-I couldn't
do it. I wouldn't do it.

20:39.656 --> 20:40.622
- And didn't do it.
- You didn't do it.

20:40.657 --> 20:44.359
[Laughter]

20:44.394 --> 20:46.295
Oh, man, and that's gonna wrap it up

20:46.330 --> 20:48.060
<i>for another edition of Comic Book Men.</i>

20:48.095 --> 20:49.194
I'm Kevin Smith.

20:49.229 --> 20:50.830
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

20:50.864 --> 20:52.366
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

20:52.400 --> 20:53.634
We'll be here all week, kids.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.303
Don't forget to tip your waitresses.

20:55.337 --> 20:56.340
Good night.
