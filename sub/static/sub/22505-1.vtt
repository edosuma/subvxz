You don't know that.
It's never been proven.

01:21:39.330 --> 01:21:40.960
(PANTING)

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:45.270
This won't bring your family back.

01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:51.210
John Kramer,

01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:53.210
gave people a chance
to win the game.

01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:56.550
A choice.

01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:58.550
Fuck!

01:21:58.580 --> 01:21:59.720
You fucker.

01:21:59.750 --> 01:22:01.220
You have a choice.

01:22:02.020 --> 01:22:04.150
Scream, or don't.

01:22:05.090 --> 01:22:06.490
Logan, Logan, Logan. Logan, hey,

01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:09.660
look, I can help you. I
can do things for you.

01:22:12.630 --> 01:22:14.730
Can you bring my wife back?

01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:16.370
Doesn't matter what
I say, does it?

01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:23.410
<i>LOGAN: I created a game that
appeared to be run by Jigsaw.</i>

01:22:30.250 --> 01:22:31.426
<i>JIGSAW: (ON RECORDER)
Hello, Edgar.</i>

01:22:31.450 --> 01:22:33.420
<i>You're about to play a game.</i>

01:22:33.450 --> 01:22:36.220
<i>Five lives are in your hands.</i>

01:22:36.250 --> 01:22:38.460
<i>Follow my instructions exactly.</i>

01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:42.130
I got to choose who
dies, them or me.

01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:44.590
I'm not fucking dying.

01:22:51.430 --> 01:22:53.040
What kind of firearm do you use?

01:22:53.070 --> 01:22:55.200
Glock 22, most cops do.

01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:56.740
Except Halloran, he's got a 17.

01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:03.650
9x19 Parabellum.
That's a Glock 17.

01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:06.350
The blood under the fingernails
of our first victim

01:23:07.650 --> 01:23:09.190
<i>is John Kramer's blood.</i>

01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:13.320
<i>LOGAN: Some will
think it's Jigsaw.</i>

01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:16.430
<i>Some will suspect you.</i>

01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:20.230
<i>But no one will suspect me.</i>

01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:23.230
Okay, we need to
bring him in. Now!

01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:25.770
<i>LOGAN: Because Eleanor
will provide my alibi.</i>

01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:28.440
Oh, yes.

01:23:34.610 --> 01:23:37.450
<i>LOGAN: Ten years ago, I came
out of the war a broken man.</i>

01:23:39.850 --> 01:23:43.190
<i>Jigsaw put the pieces of my
life back together again.</i>

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:46.820
<i>He gave my life purpose.</i>

01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:48.590
(BLUBBERING)

01:23:51.190 --> 01:23:54.800
We can never come from
anger or from vengeance.

01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:57.730
You taught me that.

01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:02.610
But then there will be no justice.

01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:04.470
No. But there will.

01:24:09.850 --> 01:24:12.250
Because we'll speak for the dead.

01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:14.350
<i>LOGAN: Together,
we built a legacy.</i>

01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:21.320
Now, I speak for the lives
ruined by people like you.

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:23.560
Murderers, rapists...

01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:26.130
Their victims appeared on my table

01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:27.360
because of you.

01:24:28.530 --> 01:24:29.800
No. No.

01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:32.440
No...

01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:35.640
No...

01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:37.540
(GROANS)

01:24:52.690 --> 01:24:53.860
I speak for the dead.

01:25:04.530 --> 01:25:06.400
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)
