WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:04.438
- Good morning, everyone.
- Oh. My. Goodness.

00:04.471 --> 00:05.539
Sarge.

00:05.573 --> 00:08.609
What. Are. The. Chances?

00:08.642 --> 00:10.411
- I say zero?
- Ugh!

00:10.444 --> 00:12.346
I mean, when Genevieve
got me these suspenders,

00:12.380 --> 00:14.091
I thought I'd lean into it
and go for the whole look,

00:14.115 --> 00:15.292
but I didn't want
to step on your toes.

00:15.316 --> 00:17.185
That being said,
you know what this means.

00:17.218 --> 00:20.121
- Don't do this, Charles.
- Oh, it's already done.

00:20.154 --> 00:21.122
Gather round, y'all.

00:21.155 --> 00:22.456
It's time to play

00:22.490 --> 00:23.457
"Who Wore It Best?"

00:23.491 --> 00:25.059
- I'd really rather not.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.560
- Because you're
a wittle chicken?

00:26.594 --> 00:29.430
Who wore it best?
Who wore it best?

00:29.463 --> 00:32.100
Who wore it beeest?

00:32.133 --> 00:33.234
- Terry.
- What?

00:33.267 --> 00:35.369
- Come on!
- You should change, Boyle.

00:35.403 --> 00:38.106
- Fine.
- Not here!

00:58.126 --> 01:00.328
- Hey, Peralta.
- How's it going, man?

01:00.361 --> 01:01.395
- Pretty good.

01:01.429 --> 01:02.396
Thanks for asking.

01:02.430 --> 01:03.864
- Cool, cool, cool.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.441
- So how's it going?
- I'm still pretty good.

01:05.465 --> 01:07.411
- Nothing has changed.
- I hadn't heard about that.

01:07.435 --> 01:09.313
- All right, you're clearly
not listening to me.

01:09.337 --> 01:11.215
- I can say whatever I want.
- Tell me about it.

01:11.239 --> 01:12.282
- I murdered Charles
this weekend.

01:12.306 --> 01:13.541
- I feel you.

01:13.574 --> 01:14.408
- Now that I have
the taste for blood,

01:14.442 --> 01:16.144
- I can't stop murdering.
- Been there.

01:16.177 --> 01:18.179
- Okay, Sarge. Sarge?

01:18.212 --> 01:20.148
- Jake.
- When'd you get here?

01:20.181 --> 01:21.315
- Wow.
- I'm sorry.

01:21.349 --> 01:22.692
I'm just trying
to see if Captain Holt

01:22.716 --> 01:23.684
is done with his meeting yet.

01:23.717 --> 01:25.419
So, how's it going?

01:25.453 --> 01:27.688
- Okay. We've been over this.
- I'm pretty good.

01:27.721 --> 01:29.457
Why are you acting so weird?

01:29.490 --> 01:31.359
- I'm nervous.
- I'm gonna talk to Captain Holt

01:31.392 --> 01:33.327
about getting me
more responsibility.

01:33.361 --> 01:34.895
Well, got to go.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.464
"Die Hard."
Explosions. Whatever.

01:36.497 --> 01:37.531
- Wait, no!

01:37.565 --> 01:40.368
Just when the conversation
was getting interesting!

01:40.401 --> 01:41.545
- Hello, Captain Raymond Holt,

01:41.569 --> 01:43.337
it is I,
Sergeant Terrance Jeffords,

01:43.371 --> 01:45.373
your friend, but more
importantly, your employee.

01:45.406 --> 01:47.341
- I've never heard you
speak like this, Sergeant.

01:47.375 --> 01:48.276
I like it.

01:48.309 --> 01:50.911
Each sentence
so rife with information.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.646
- Go on, please.
- Thank you.

01:52.680 --> 01:53.714
I can do more, sir.

01:53.747 --> 01:57.318
I'd like to take on
additional responsibilities.

01:57.351 --> 01:58.695
- Good. I like seeing you
take initiative.

01:58.719 --> 02:01.355
Let's see what there is.

02:02.756 --> 02:06.294
One Police Plaza is looking
for a City Council liaison.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.696
That's a rewarding
but challenging opportunity,

02:08.729 --> 02:10.398
but I think
you'll do a great job.

02:10.431 --> 02:11.908
- That sounds perfect.
- Thank you, Captain.

02:11.932 --> 02:13.934
- My pleasure. The application
is due tomorrow.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.536
- Okay.
- It's 96 pages.

02:15.569 --> 02:16.704
- Okay. Okay.
- Not including

02:16.737 --> 02:18.472
a 4,000-word personal essay.

02:18.506 --> 02:20.217
- Okay. Okay. Okay.
- Will that be a problem?

02:20.241 --> 02:21.642
- No!

02:21.675 --> 02:23.244
Not a problem for Terry.

02:23.277 --> 02:25.513
Terry does not have
a problem at all.

02:25.546 --> 02:27.181
Terry's got a big problem!

02:27.215 --> 02:28.416
- Ooh! Math or real life?

02:28.449 --> 02:30.218
- Why would I have
a big math problem?

02:30.251 --> 02:31.528
- I've seen it happen.
- I'm supposed to pick up

02:31.552 --> 02:34.222
Cagney and Lacey from day care
in 30 minutes,

02:34.255 --> 02:35.399
but I have to stay late
to work on an application

02:35.423 --> 02:36.590
I just got from Holt.

02:36.624 --> 02:37.734
- They're six.
- They can take the subway.

02:37.758 --> 02:40.428
- Rosa, that's crazy.
- They're babies.

02:40.461 --> 02:41.962
Terry, just call them an Uber.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.564
- Or just have your sitter
pick 'em up.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.699
- Scully actually has
the most reasonable idea.

02:45.733 --> 02:47.601
These truly are strange days.

02:47.635 --> 02:48.702
- Sharon can't pick 'em up

02:48.736 --> 02:49.779
'cause she's out of town
with Ava,

02:49.803 --> 02:51.739
and the sitter doesn't get
to my house till 6:30.

02:51.772 --> 02:53.641
- Jake and I can pick them up.
- Absolutely.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.485
Couple of issues...
I don't have any car seats,

02:55.509 --> 02:58.446
and my rear window is
technically a "shower curtain."

02:58.479 --> 03:00.448
- Really? Why?
- Mm.

03:00.481 --> 03:01.758
- You know what?
- Doesn't matter.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.684
- Just take my minivan.
- You got it.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.453
- Thanks, guys.
- I appreciate it.

03:05.486 --> 03:08.656
- Mm, mm-mm-mm-mm!

03:08.689 --> 03:09.523
Mm-mm!

03:09.557 --> 03:10.967
- Why are you doing that
with your face?

03:10.991 --> 03:12.793
- I'm smiling
at Mommy and Daddy.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.262
- Ugh.
- Gross.

03:14.295 --> 03:15.439
- Picking up Cagney and Lacey.

03:15.463 --> 03:16.706
One taste of practice parenting,

03:16.730 --> 03:19.267
and you two will be so hot
to have sex.

03:19.300 --> 03:20.310
The kind that make babies.

03:20.334 --> 03:22.403
- Walk away, Charles.
- Okay.

03:22.436 --> 03:24.372
But I'll be back in nine months.

03:24.405 --> 03:26.974
- How ridiculous is Charles?
- Pssh.

03:27.007 --> 03:28.542
- So ridiculous. Pssh.

03:28.576 --> 03:29.977
- Pssh.
- Pssh.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.712
- Pssh.
- Hey, girls!

03:31.745 --> 03:32.546
Who's the coolest person

03:32.580 --> 03:34.515
you've ever met
in your entire lives?

03:34.548 --> 03:35.583
You are!

03:35.616 --> 03:37.718
- And who's the most handsome
dude in all the land,

03:37.751 --> 03:39.820
even objectively more
than Idris Elba?

03:39.853 --> 03:41.255
You are!

03:41.289 --> 03:42.155
- Man, kids are awesome.

03:42.189 --> 03:43.567
You can tell them
literally anything,

03:43.591 --> 03:44.558
and they'll just say it.

03:44.592 --> 03:45.493
- I know, right?
- Check it out.

03:45.526 --> 03:47.795
Who was the first
female congresswoman?

03:47.828 --> 03:49.730
Jeannette Rankin!

03:49.763 --> 03:51.641
- Oh. That's fun.
- They won't get teased for that.

03:51.665 --> 03:54.335
Up. Down. Up. Down.
Up. Down. Up. Down. Up. Down.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.570
- Oh, uh, maybe don't play
with the windows?

03:56.604 --> 03:57.438
Jake, tell them to stop.

03:57.471 --> 03:58.815
- But playing with the windows
is fun.

03:58.839 --> 03:59.640
- Jake.
- And...

03:59.673 --> 04:01.375
it could spark
a lifelong interest

04:01.409 --> 04:02.476
in mechanical engineering.

04:02.510 --> 04:04.812
But sure. If you want,
I'll tell these young girls

04:04.845 --> 04:07.348
that you don't think science
is a good fit for them.

04:07.381 --> 04:08.692
- Play with those windows,
ladies.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.418
Yay!

04:10.451 --> 04:13.387
- That was actually really cool
with Cagney and Lacey.

04:13.421 --> 04:14.488
I think we rocked it.

04:14.522 --> 04:16.324
- Right? I don't see
what the big deal is

04:16.357 --> 04:18.058
about being a parent...
That was so easy.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.627
- Yeah,
anyone who's ever complained

04:19.660 --> 04:21.661
about parenting
has no idea what they're doing.

04:21.695 --> 04:23.697
Mm.

04:23.731 --> 04:25.032
Hey, it's the sarge.

04:25.065 --> 04:27.735
Probably calling
for some child-rearing tips.

04:27.768 --> 04:28.845
Parent of the year speaking.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.371
Terry, baby, talk to me.

04:30.404 --> 04:32.306
- Where the hell is Moo Moo?

04:32.340 --> 04:34.342
- Oh, no. I think Terry
has a child named Moo Moo,

04:34.375 --> 04:35.485
and we forgot to pick her up.

04:35.509 --> 04:36.577
- It's not a baby, Jake.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.711
It's Cagney's blankie.

04:37.745 --> 04:40.080
She calls it that because
it has a little cow head.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.582
She said
she had it in the minivan.

04:41.615 --> 04:42.583
Where is it now?

04:42.616 --> 04:44.352
- Uhhh...

04:44.385 --> 04:47.721
Up. Down. Up. Down.
Up. Down. Up. Down.

04:47.755 --> 04:49.098
- Never let 'em
play with the windows.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.658
That's Parenting 101.

04:50.691 --> 04:52.726
And Santiago, I can't believe
you didn't stop it.

04:52.760 --> 04:53.627
- I'm sorry, sir.

04:53.661 --> 04:55.463
I knew it was wrong,
and I did nothing,

04:55.496 --> 04:56.697
which is ultimately worse.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.532
- Cagney can't sleep
without Moo Moo,

04:58.566 --> 05:00.901
and if Cagney doesn't sleep,
then Lacey doesn't sleep,

05:00.934 --> 05:02.736
and if Cagney and Lacey
don't sleep...

05:02.770 --> 05:03.837
- Terry doesn't sleep.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.373
- No. Jake doesn't live.

05:05.406 --> 05:06.239
- Oh, my God.
- Where did you start

05:06.273 --> 05:07.875
letting them play
with the windows?

05:07.908 --> 05:10.378
- Uh, on Eighth.
- It was close to the house.

05:10.411 --> 05:11.178
- It better be.

05:11.211 --> 05:12.489
The sitter leaves
in ten minutes,

05:12.513 --> 05:13.914
and this is the last thing
I need!

05:13.947 --> 05:16.350
- Okay.
- So sorry about this, Sarge.

05:16.384 --> 05:17.518
Oh, and one more thing.

05:18.886 --> 05:22.390
I love you.

05:22.423 --> 05:24.458
- I love you too, Jake.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.362
Moo Moo?
Moo Moo!

05:29.530 --> 05:30.664
- What's going on, buddy?

05:30.698 --> 05:32.500
- Oh, hey.
- Whoa, whoa, don't move.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.134
- Oh, I was just...
- Step back.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.404
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

05:36.437 --> 05:38.606
Drop that.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.645
- Hey, Sarge.

05:44.678 --> 05:45.922
We felt really bad
about Moo Moo,

05:45.946 --> 05:47.915
so we got you a new one.

05:47.948 --> 05:49.817
- She's called New Moo.
- I don't want it.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.919
- Oh, the liaison application
got you down?

05:51.952 --> 05:53.930
- I finished that.
- I know. There's nothing sadder

05:53.954 --> 05:55.923
than finishing a nice,
long juicy application.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.825
It's like, why can't
there be another essay

05:57.858 --> 05:58.926
or even a short answer?

05:58.959 --> 06:00.937
- No one is relating to you
right now. What's wrong?

06:00.961 --> 06:02.696
- I got stopped by a cop
last night.

06:02.730 --> 06:04.832
- Stopped for what?
- Stopped for walking.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.567
- That makes zero sense
unless...

06:07.701 --> 06:08.869
Oh, crap.
I see what happened.

06:08.902 --> 06:11.004
- Yeah.
- Sarge, that's terrible.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.573
- That's so messed up.

06:12.606 --> 06:15.075
- Oh, jeez.
- I have no idea what's going on.

06:15.108 --> 06:16.677
- He got stopped
for being black.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.846
- Get woke, Scully.
- What happened?

06:18.879 --> 06:19.813
- It was right after
I found Moo Moo.

06:19.847 --> 06:21.649
- What're you doing
in this neighborhood,

06:21.682 --> 06:23.150
- buddy?
- I live here. Listen...

06:23.183 --> 06:24.818
- Whoa. You need
to lower your voice.

06:24.852 --> 06:26.086
- Lower my voice?

06:26.119 --> 06:27.631
- You know what?
- Put your hands on your head.

06:27.655 --> 06:29.132
Turn around.
Don't make any sudden movements.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.958
- I didn't do anything.
- Also, I'm a...

06:30.991 --> 06:33.961
- Keep talking.
- See what happens next, huh?

06:33.994 --> 06:35.062
Big guy.

06:35.095 --> 06:36.105
- Well, did you tell him
you're a cop?

06:36.129 --> 06:37.097
- I tried to,

06:37.130 --> 06:38.699
but things escalated so quickly,

06:38.732 --> 06:39.943
and I didn't have my badge
on me.

06:39.967 --> 06:40.901
I eventually told him,

06:40.934 --> 06:42.870
and he finally looked me up
in the system

06:42.903 --> 06:43.937
and let me go.

06:43.971 --> 06:45.915
- I can't believe this...
- I mean, nothing like that

06:45.939 --> 06:46.907
has ever happened to me,
and I've done

06:46.940 --> 06:48.942
some pretty suspicious things
in the street.

06:48.976 --> 06:50.978
- Hey, hey, hey, there.
- What are you doing?

06:51.011 --> 06:52.980
- I'm just playing a prank
on my buddy.

06:53.013 --> 06:55.983
- Sounds fun.
- Carry on.

06:56.016 --> 06:56.784
- It was a very good prank.

06:56.817 --> 06:58.952
I totally thought
I was gonna die.

06:58.986 --> 07:00.864
- I mean, I've had run-ins
with officers before,

07:00.888 --> 07:02.990
but this one really stings.

07:03.023 --> 07:05.058
It was right outside my home.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.135
- So what are you gonna do?
- Slash his tires?

07:06.159 --> 07:07.336
You shouldn't do that,
but just out of curiosity,

07:07.360 --> 07:09.763
what kind of car does he drive,
and where does he park it?

07:09.797 --> 07:10.874
- You could file
an official complaint.

07:10.898 --> 07:11.941
I mean,
Captain Holt would wield that

07:11.965 --> 07:13.867
like a hammer and crush the guy.

07:13.901 --> 07:16.012
- I don't want to start
a whole hullaballoo, all right?

07:16.036 --> 07:18.138
I mean, I think I just need
to sit down with the guy

07:18.171 --> 07:20.073
and have a direct conversation,

07:20.107 --> 07:22.042
just to make sure
he doesn't ever do anything

07:22.075 --> 07:22.976
like this again.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.612
- That makes sense.
- You think you two

07:24.645 --> 07:25.613
can handle watching the kids

07:25.646 --> 07:26.956
while I meet
with Officer Maldack?

07:26.980 --> 07:28.181
- Oh, they can handle it.

07:28.215 --> 07:30.017
- Calm down, Charles.
- Ugh.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.852
- But yes, Terry,
we can watch the kids.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.854
Trust me. There's nothing
those little munchkins

07:33.887 --> 07:35.789
can throw at us
that we can't handle.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.958
- Why was Daddy in trouble
with the policeman?

07:37.991 --> 07:41.629
- Uh... that's complicated.

07:41.662 --> 07:42.763
- Is it because he's black?

07:42.796 --> 07:44.031
Uh...

07:44.064 --> 07:45.699
- What do we do?
- We can't call Terry.

07:45.733 --> 07:47.076
We told him
we could handle anything.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.168
I've got it.
We just leave.

07:48.201 --> 07:49.870
We go home.
Never speak of this.

07:49.903 --> 07:52.205
- No! We can't leave the
children that are in our care.

07:52.239 --> 07:53.206
- Right.
- Let me call Charles.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.207
He's a parent.

07:54.241 --> 07:55.242
He'll know what to do.

07:55.275 --> 07:56.243
- Smart.
- Mm.

07:56.276 --> 07:57.911
A parental crisis.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.122
This is the good stuff
right here.

07:59.146 --> 08:03.984
You are knee-deep in the thick,
rich broth of parenthood.

08:04.017 --> 08:04.985
- Well, that was a nightmare.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.186
Who else can we call?

08:06.219 --> 08:07.921
- I'm already ahead of you.
- Calling Rosa.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.923
- Make 'em go to bed.
- It's 6:30 p.m.

08:09.957 --> 08:11.024
They're not tired.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.225
- Make. Them.

08:12.259 --> 08:13.794
- Okay. Hang up.
- I'll call Gina.

08:13.827 --> 08:14.895
- Ugh. Come on, Jake.

08:14.928 --> 08:17.030
Just explain the deep-rooted
institutionalized racism

08:17.064 --> 08:19.066
that remains pervasive
in this country

08:19.099 --> 08:20.200
to this day.

08:20.233 --> 08:22.002
- Gina, they're children.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.203
- So put it in a song, Jake.

08:23.236 --> 08:24.772
Watch this.

08:24.805 --> 08:27.941
* Racism, racism

08:27.975 --> 08:30.210
- I'm hanging up.
- * Racism

08:30.243 --> 08:32.078
- Gina, I'm hanging up.
- * Racism, baby

08:32.111 --> 08:33.947
- That's a great song.
- I'm hanging up.

08:33.981 --> 08:36.216
Okay. So Gina was
a bust as well.

08:36.249 --> 08:38.818
Looks like we're out of options.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.220
Unless.

08:40.253 --> 08:42.089
- No.
- It's all we have.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.025
- Hey, Jakey.

08:45.058 --> 08:46.202
Yeah, I'd love to chat,
but I can't.

08:46.226 --> 08:48.161
Hitchcock and I are eating cake
for dinner

08:48.195 --> 08:49.296
and watching a movie.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.131
- Ask Amy
if she wants to come over.

08:51.164 --> 08:51.965
- I'm hanging up.

08:51.999 --> 08:54.101
Why're you smiling?

08:54.134 --> 08:56.103
- That was useless.
- Are you kidding me?

08:56.136 --> 08:59.006
Hitchcock and Scully
just handed us a gem.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.207
- Who wants cake?

09:00.240 --> 09:01.775
Me!

09:01.809 --> 09:03.319
- And who wants to watch
"101 Dalmatians"

09:03.343 --> 09:05.045
and not ask
any hard-to-answer questions

09:05.078 --> 09:06.780
about your father and race?

09:06.814 --> 09:08.882
- Me! Me! Me!
- Nice.

09:10.117 --> 09:12.019
- Officer Maldack.
- Thanks for coming.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.321
- Hey.

09:14.354 --> 09:16.990
I'm really glad you set this up.

09:17.024 --> 09:18.892
I'm so sorry for what happened.

09:18.926 --> 09:22.162
- Oh. Wow.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.732
I am really happy to hear that.

09:24.765 --> 09:27.367
I was thinking this conversation
was gonna go a lot differently.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.869
- No, no.
- It was an honest mistake.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.013
I mean,
if I had known you were a cop,

09:30.037 --> 09:31.180
I never would've treated you
that way.

09:31.204 --> 09:35.308
- So you're sorry for not
knowing I was a cop sooner?

09:35.342 --> 09:37.044
- Yeah.
- And that's it?

09:37.077 --> 09:39.212
- Yeah.
- But you shouldn't have

09:39.246 --> 09:42.282
treated me that way
whether I was a cop or not.

09:42.315 --> 09:43.817
- What do you mean?

09:43.851 --> 09:45.886
- I was just walking
down the street.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.388
There's nothing suspicious
or illegal about that.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.661
- Okay, but you and I both know

09:49.690 --> 09:53.093
that you don't exactly look like
you belong in that neighborhood.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.294
- I live there.
- Look.

09:54.327 --> 09:56.172
Nine out of ten times I get
called to that neighborhood,

09:56.196 --> 09:57.306
it's about a guy
that looks like you.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.032
- Were you responding to a call?

09:59.066 --> 10:00.209
- No,
but you're missing the point.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.035
- No, you're missing the point.

10:02.069 --> 10:03.170
I just want you to admit

10:03.203 --> 10:04.905
you only stopped me
because I'm black

10:04.938 --> 10:07.174
and to apologize
and say you won't do it again!

10:07.207 --> 10:08.175
- Hey, look.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.210
We wouldn't even be having
this conversation

10:10.243 --> 10:10.878
if you had your badge on you.

10:10.911 --> 10:12.179
Next time, don't forget it.

10:12.212 --> 10:13.947
- Oh, so this is all my fault?

10:13.981 --> 10:15.291
- I'm not apologizing
for doing my job.

10:15.315 --> 10:17.350
- That's not the job, man.

10:19.252 --> 10:20.930
- Whoa. I can't believe
it went down like that.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.932
- Should we maybe revisit
some of our earlier ideas

10:22.956 --> 10:24.825
vis-à-vis tires and slashing?

10:24.858 --> 10:27.170
- I should've known there was
no talking to a guy like that.

10:27.194 --> 10:29.162
I don't see any other option.

10:29.196 --> 10:31.198
I'm submitting
an official complaint with Holt.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.342
- I know it might feel weird
to report another officer,

10:33.366 --> 10:35.068
but it's the right move.

10:35.102 --> 10:36.345
- Holt's gonna eat him
for breakfast.

10:36.369 --> 10:40.007
- Maldack has no idea
what's about to hit him.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.877
- I'm not gonna submit this.

10:43.911 --> 10:45.345
- What? Why not?

10:45.378 --> 10:47.280
- Because
I think it's a mistake.

10:52.886 --> 10:54.387
- Hey, Sarge?
- Everything okay?

10:54.421 --> 10:58.391
Only ask 'cause you haven't
moved in the last 58 minutes.

10:58.425 --> 11:00.360
- He doesn't want me
to file the complaint.

11:00.393 --> 11:02.362
- Well, of course
Officer Maldack doesn't want you

11:02.395 --> 11:03.463
to file the complaint.

11:03.496 --> 11:04.331
He's the one
being complained about.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.066
I just realized
you meant Captain Holt.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.167
- Yeah.
- What?

11:07.200 --> 11:08.468
Did you mess up the grammar

11:08.501 --> 11:09.779
- or something?
- Did you dangle a participle?

11:09.803 --> 11:12.205
Ugh, Terry,
Holt hates a dangler.

11:12.239 --> 11:14.407
- Grammar was fine.

11:14.441 --> 11:16.409
He said he thought
filing it was a mistake.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.078
- Wow. Well, look.

11:18.111 --> 11:20.213
Captain Holt cares about you
more than anything.

11:20.247 --> 11:22.182
I'm sure he's got a good reason.

11:22.215 --> 11:23.492
Maybe you should go talk to him
about it, you know?

11:23.516 --> 11:25.152
Go to his house.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.387
- Yeah. That's a good idea.
- I'm gonna do that.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.856
- And while
you're talking to him,

11:28.889 --> 11:30.758
Jake and Amy can babysit
your kids.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.793
Unless they're too busy
making babies of their own.

11:32.826 --> 11:35.829
- Shaka-daka-dow.
- Get out of us.

11:35.863 --> 11:38.498
But yes, we are happy
to look after the kids again.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.101
- Thanks, guys.
- I appreciate your support.

11:41.134 --> 11:42.335
Now, I'm gonna go find out

11:42.369 --> 11:45.438
what the hell is going on
with Captain Holt.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.109
- Are you two sure
you should be babysitting?

11:49.142 --> 11:50.286
You seemed real freaked
when you called me last night.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.846
- Yes, but then we figured out
how to be good parents.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.347
TV and cake.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.449
- TV and cake were my parents.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.888
- It's okay.

12:03.423 --> 12:04.491
- Sergeant Jeffords.

12:04.524 --> 12:05.492
- That's right.

12:05.525 --> 12:06.760
It's me, Sergeant Jeffords,

12:06.794 --> 12:07.527
from the precinct.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.229
I'm the guy whose damn complaint

12:09.262 --> 12:10.197
you don't want to submit,

12:10.230 --> 12:13.266
and I can't think
of one damn reason why!

12:13.300 --> 12:14.467
- Everyone.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.436
This is Sergeant Jeffords.

12:17.537 --> 12:19.472
- Hi!

12:19.506 --> 12:21.508
I'm sorry for interrupting
your dinner party.

12:21.541 --> 12:22.986
- No problem at all.
- This is important.

12:23.010 --> 12:24.544
Also,
Kevin's friend Margo is here,

12:24.577 --> 12:26.513
and she's a real class-A drip.

12:26.546 --> 12:29.382
- Sir, I can't get why you don't
want me to file the complaint.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.885
I thought you of all people
would support me.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.930
- First of all, let me say,
what that officer did to you

12:33.954 --> 12:36.556
was wrong, deeply wrong,
and I'm furious about it.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.491
- Okay.
- So why don't you back me up?

12:38.525 --> 12:40.560
- Because that complaint
could backfire.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.395
Cops who blow the whistle
on other cops

12:42.429 --> 12:44.164
almost always face a backlash,

12:44.197 --> 12:46.233
just like people
who socialize with Margo

12:46.266 --> 12:48.168
invariably hear about
her trip to Scottsdale.

12:48.201 --> 12:49.578
- You're real worked up
about Margo.

12:49.602 --> 12:50.971
- Sorry.

12:51.004 --> 12:52.572
She's horrible.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.483
Listen, I don't want to see
your career derailed

12:54.507 --> 12:55.584
because you were besmirched

12:55.608 --> 12:57.344
for reporting
on another officer.

12:57.377 --> 12:58.454
- But what he did was wrong.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.180
He should be besmirched!

13:00.213 --> 13:01.048
- Yes,
but is that besmirching worth

13:01.081 --> 13:02.425
the greater besmirching
of your career?

13:02.449 --> 13:03.984
You have to balance
besmirchings.

13:04.017 --> 13:05.452
There's politics to being a cop.

13:05.485 --> 13:07.187
- But I wasn't harassed
for being a cop.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.922
I was harassed as a black man.

13:08.956 --> 13:09.999
- I'm not saying do nothing.

13:10.023 --> 13:12.025
I'm saying
the most powerful action

13:12.059 --> 13:13.927
you can take
is to rise through the ranks

13:13.961 --> 13:15.595
so that you can make
large-scale changes.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.430
I've had to pick my battles,

13:17.464 --> 13:18.932
and it hasn't always been easy,

13:18.966 --> 13:20.500
but now I have my own precinct,

13:20.533 --> 13:22.502
a precinct whose officers
would never do to you

13:22.535 --> 13:23.937
what Officer Maldack did.

13:23.971 --> 13:25.939
- I understand
what you're saying, but...

13:25.973 --> 13:28.275
- Shh.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.377
I hear Margo's squeaky shoes
in the hallway.

13:30.410 --> 13:33.847
One guess as to where in Arizona
she brought them. Scottsdale.

13:33.881 --> 13:35.515
- Oh. Ray.
- There you are.

13:35.548 --> 13:37.550
I'm about to start
my Scottsdale slideshow.

13:37.584 --> 13:38.624
It has all the highlights.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.221
- There are no highlights
in Scottsdale, Margo.

13:41.254 --> 13:43.323
- That's what you think,
Raymond.

13:48.428 --> 13:49.963
- Okay, we got
chocolate-chocolate,

13:49.997 --> 13:52.299
chocolate-vanilla,
and my personal favorite,

13:52.332 --> 13:53.934
a bowl full of cake batter.

13:53.967 --> 13:56.469
- And loads o' movies.
- Eh?

13:56.503 --> 13:57.871
- We don't want to do that.

13:57.905 --> 13:59.306
- Uh, maybe you didn't

13:59.339 --> 14:00.307
hear us correctly.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.308
We've got cake.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.309
We've got movies.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.944
It's time to party!

14:03.977 --> 14:05.354
- Is being black bad?
- We're black.

14:05.378 --> 14:08.381
Are we gonna get in trouble
like Daddy?

14:09.482 --> 14:10.659
- Jake, can I talk to you
for a second?

14:10.683 --> 14:11.418
- Yes, please.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.320
- We have a problem.
- I know.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.630
What kind of kids
don't want to eat cake?

14:14.654 --> 14:16.623
Should we call Child Services
on Terry?

14:16.656 --> 14:18.101
- Jake, I think
we have to face the music

14:18.125 --> 14:19.592
and talk to them for real.

14:19.626 --> 14:21.628
- I know.
- You're right.

14:21.661 --> 14:23.639
But I'm gonna munch the cake
batter while we do it.

14:23.663 --> 14:24.908
If you don't
eat the raw egg fast,

14:24.932 --> 14:27.500
it makes you even more sick.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.302
- Never mind, let's go.
- Okay.

14:29.336 --> 14:30.570
- Okay, girls.

14:30.603 --> 14:31.647
There's something
called prejudice,

14:31.671 --> 14:34.574
which comes from the Latin words
"pre," or "before,"

14:34.607 --> 14:36.643
and "judicium,"
which means "to judge."

14:36.676 --> 14:37.644
Are you with me so far?

14:37.677 --> 14:39.612
- No.
- No.

14:39.646 --> 14:41.681
- Okay. Um,

14:41.714 --> 14:43.592
you know how it's tougher
in this world to be a woman?

14:43.616 --> 14:45.018
It is?

14:45.052 --> 14:46.429
- No. No, no, no.
- That's not what I meant.

14:46.453 --> 14:48.321
- Then I don't want to be
a woman.

14:48.355 --> 14:49.598
- Me neither.
- You don't have to be

14:49.622 --> 14:50.699
if that's who you are...
You know what?

14:50.723 --> 14:52.125
That's a whole other
conversation.

14:52.159 --> 14:54.027
Uh...

14:54.061 --> 14:55.028
Okay. Here we go.

14:55.062 --> 14:57.097
A cop did a bad thing

14:57.130 --> 14:58.374
and tried to get your daddy
in trouble,

14:58.398 --> 15:00.100
but your daddy didn't do
anything wrong.

15:00.133 --> 15:02.569
- Because Daddy's black?

15:02.602 --> 15:03.570
- Yeah.

15:03.603 --> 15:05.072
- That's scary.

15:05.105 --> 15:06.106
- It is scary.

15:06.139 --> 15:08.675
But that cop was wrong,
and what he did was bad.

15:08.708 --> 15:10.686
- And the most important thing
is your daddy's okay,

15:10.710 --> 15:11.778
and he's not in trouble,

15:11.811 --> 15:14.114
and he loves you both
more than anything in the world.

15:14.147 --> 15:16.416
- Okay?
- Okay.

15:16.449 --> 15:17.650
- Yeah. Okay.

15:17.684 --> 15:20.120
Well, that wasn't so bad.

15:20.153 --> 15:23.490
Well, if you guys have any other
questions, we're here for you.

15:23.523 --> 15:25.558
- What's an orgasm?
- Come on!

15:25.592 --> 15:26.635
- Terry, I know you're upset,

15:26.659 --> 15:27.703
but this is
the right thing to do.

15:27.727 --> 15:29.963
You're this close
to the City Council position,

15:29.997 --> 15:31.498
and that's just the beginning.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.700
It would be a shame
to jeopardize that.

15:33.733 --> 15:35.535
- Look, I get
that the guys in our precinct

15:35.568 --> 15:36.536
wouldn't profile me,

15:36.569 --> 15:37.637
but it still happened

15:37.670 --> 15:39.572
only one precinct over.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.350
- Which is why you need to keep
pushing forward in your career,

15:41.374 --> 15:42.976
so that you can
change the system.

15:43.010 --> 15:44.644
Terry, you're a great cop.

15:44.677 --> 15:46.646
You could become
a chief or higher.

15:46.679 --> 15:49.382
- How long will it take
to make change that way?

15:49.416 --> 15:52.385
Maldack is on the street now.

15:52.419 --> 15:53.753
You know why I became a cop?

15:53.786 --> 15:54.754
- Please share.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.156
- Because when I was a kid,

15:56.189 --> 15:58.125
I always wanted
to be a superhero.

15:58.158 --> 16:00.560
- Stop it!
- Stop bothering little Terry!

16:00.593 --> 16:03.596
- Or what?
- Or I will defeat you!

16:11.038 --> 16:12.439
Whoa.

16:12.472 --> 16:16.043
- I wanted to help people
like that cop helped me.

16:16.076 --> 16:17.610
But right now,

16:17.644 --> 16:19.646
I don't feel like a superhero.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.748
I feel the opposite.

16:21.781 --> 16:24.017
When I got stopped
the other day,

16:24.051 --> 16:26.186
I wasn't a cop.

16:26.219 --> 16:28.388
I wasn't a guy
who lived in a neighborhood

16:28.421 --> 16:30.423
looking for his daughter's toy.

16:30.457 --> 16:35.062
I was a black man,
a dangerous black man.

16:35.095 --> 16:39.666
A threat.

16:39.699 --> 16:42.735
And I couldn't stop thinking
about my daughters.

16:42.769 --> 16:44.037
And their future.

16:44.071 --> 16:45.772
And how years from now,

16:45.805 --> 16:48.175
they could be walking
down the street,

16:48.208 --> 16:49.576
looking for their kids' Moo Moo,

16:49.609 --> 16:52.079
and get stopped by a bad cop.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.090
And they probably won't
get to play the police card

16:54.114 --> 16:57.150
to get out of trouble.

16:57.184 --> 16:59.119
I don't like that thought,

16:59.152 --> 17:01.221
and I'm gonna do something
about it.

17:01.254 --> 17:03.690
So I don't care
if it might hurt my career.

17:03.723 --> 17:05.724
I'm filing that report.

17:05.758 --> 17:10.029
Even if I have to go
over your head to do it.

17:13.099 --> 17:14.634
- Kind of seemed
like you were gonna

17:14.666 --> 17:16.836
get up and leave
after saying all that.

17:16.868 --> 17:18.805
- I was,
but I think I hear Margo.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.211
- Thanks for babysitting
last night.

17:24.243 --> 17:25.621
The girls told me
what you talked about,

17:25.645 --> 17:26.789
and it couldn't have been easy.

17:26.813 --> 17:27.579
- I'm sorry I told them

17:27.614 --> 17:29.282
orgasms was another word
for oranges.

17:29.316 --> 17:30.817
I panicked.

17:30.850 --> 17:31.818
- Yeah, it did make it awkward

17:31.851 --> 17:34.087
when they asked for orgasm juice
this morning,

17:34.121 --> 17:35.831
but I was more talking
about the other stuff.

17:35.855 --> 17:37.724
- Yeah. We didn't really know
what to say.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.259
At one point,
I'm pretty sure I sang

17:39.292 --> 17:41.161
all of En Vogue's
"Free Your Mind."

17:41.194 --> 17:43.296
- Well, they had fun,
and you made 'em feel safe.

17:43.330 --> 17:44.197
You did good.

17:44.231 --> 17:47.167
Oh. They made you
a "thank you" card.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.135
- Aww.

17:48.168 --> 17:50.337
Pretty sure
my nose isn't quite this big,

17:50.370 --> 17:52.339
especially with all
the racial sensitivity talk,

17:52.372 --> 17:53.606
but I appreciate the effort.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.208
- Sergeant Jeffords.

17:55.242 --> 17:57.310
A moment of your time, please.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.113
I came to a realization

18:00.147 --> 18:01.224
after you stormed out
last night.

18:01.248 --> 18:03.250
- I wouldn't say I stormed out.

18:03.283 --> 18:05.652
I shook hands with both you
and Kevin before I left.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.325
- And Kevin and I agreed
that you squeezed

18:07.354 --> 18:09.322
significantly tighter
than necessary.

18:09.356 --> 18:10.857
- I guess I was
a little worked up.

18:10.890 --> 18:12.292
- With good reason.

18:12.325 --> 18:14.261
I thought a lot
about our conversation.

18:14.294 --> 18:15.728
When I was a young
police officer

18:15.762 --> 18:17.664
and things like this
would happen to me,

18:17.697 --> 18:18.665
I felt very alone.

18:18.698 --> 18:22.335
I wanted to call out
every bad cop I encountered,

18:22.369 --> 18:24.437
and there were a lot,
but as a black gay man,

18:24.471 --> 18:27.707
I never had a superior
who was on my side,

18:27.740 --> 18:29.376
so the advice I offered you,

18:29.409 --> 18:32.645
that came from a different place
at a different time.

18:32.679 --> 18:35.848
I put all my energy
towards rising to a rank

18:35.882 --> 18:37.350
where I could make a difference.

18:37.384 --> 18:43.656
Well, I'm there now,
and I realize

18:43.690 --> 18:45.625
that if I don't
back you up on this,

18:45.658 --> 18:47.827
I would be betraying
the very thing

18:47.860 --> 18:50.230
that I worked so hard for,

18:50.263 --> 18:51.864
so I filed the complaint.

18:51.898 --> 18:54.367
- I appreciate that, Captain.

18:56.369 --> 18:58.871
- Are you still upset?
- No. Not at all.

18:58.905 --> 19:00.283
- You should consider
modifying your handshake.

19:00.307 --> 19:01.908
It's sending the wrong message.

19:01.941 --> 19:03.710
- Copy that.

19:03.743 --> 19:06.246
- Whew. I am so glad
we don't have to do

19:06.279 --> 19:07.390
any more babysitting
for a while.

19:07.414 --> 19:09.449
- I know.
- It was so stressful.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.850
- So stressful.

19:10.883 --> 19:13.420
But, like, actually
kind of rewarding too.

19:13.453 --> 19:16.356
- Shaping young minds like that
felt so powerful.

19:16.389 --> 19:18.258
- Yeah.
- But, like, so exhausting.

19:18.291 --> 19:20.269
- Oh, yeah. Can you imagine
doing that every night?

19:20.293 --> 19:21.127
Forget it.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.263
But also, their little shoes
are so cute.

19:23.296 --> 19:24.373
They're like little circles.

19:24.397 --> 19:26.266
- I know,
and everything they hold

19:26.299 --> 19:28.735
looks so big
because their hands are so tiny.

19:28.768 --> 19:31.271
- Yeah, and they have to hold
a cup of water with both hands

19:31.304 --> 19:32.381
- 'cause they're so weak.
- I know!

19:32.405 --> 19:33.406
- Whoo-whee!

19:33.440 --> 19:34.907
That's what I'm talking about!

19:34.941 --> 19:36.876
- Boyle.
- Lucky for you,

19:36.909 --> 19:38.478
Amy, I am an unlicensed doula.

19:38.511 --> 19:39.979
I've delivered three
of my cousins

19:40.012 --> 19:41.914
and one of my uncles...
Long story.

19:41.948 --> 19:43.916
- Go away!
- Yes, Papa.

19:45.418 --> 19:46.886
- Please close the blinds.

19:46.919 --> 19:49.422
We're about to violate several
departmental regulations.

19:49.456 --> 19:51.324
- Ho, ho!
- All right!

19:51.358 --> 19:52.501
- It's been a very long week,

19:52.525 --> 19:54.227
and as of right now,

19:54.261 --> 19:55.728
we're both off duty.

19:55.762 --> 19:56.872
I think we've earned a drink.

19:56.896 --> 19:59.266
- I can get behind that.

19:59.299 --> 20:01.734
- I heard from City Council
about the liaison position.

20:01.768 --> 20:03.336
- Is that right?

20:03.370 --> 20:04.337
- You didn't get it.

20:04.371 --> 20:05.938
- Oh.

20:05.972 --> 20:08.408
Oh, this is a sad drink.

20:08.441 --> 20:10.243
Was it the complaint?

20:10.277 --> 20:12.779
- We'll never know for sure,
but, uh, I think it's likely.

20:12.812 --> 20:15.482
However, this is
not a sad drink.

20:15.515 --> 20:16.849
We're celebrating

20:16.883 --> 20:21.454
to doing the right thing.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.391
- I don't know.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.926
Maybe we shouldn't have
filed the complaint.

20:26.959 --> 20:29.929
Maybe I could've done more
if I had gotten the liaison job.

20:29.962 --> 20:30.997
- Maybe.

20:31.030 --> 20:32.432
But one thing's for certain.

20:32.465 --> 20:33.433
Maldack will think twice

20:33.466 --> 20:36.303
before making another bad stop
like that again.

20:36.336 --> 20:37.870
That's a win.

20:37.904 --> 20:39.872
- Yeah.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.808
It's tough.

20:41.841 --> 20:43.376
- It is.

20:45.044 --> 20:46.446
So if Sharon's
still out of town,

20:46.479 --> 20:48.381
who's, uh, looking out
for Cagney and Lacey?

20:51.384 --> 20:53.420
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
