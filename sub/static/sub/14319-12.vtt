you'd rather not know.

07:41.125 --> 07:44.208
perhaps we can
use their struggle

07:44.208 --> 07:47.625
Come, my brother,
there is much we must do.

07:47.625 --> 07:51.625

is right, Ka-Zar

back to our land?

09:24.833 --> 09:27.583
If he had not created
those cursed Mutates,

09:27.583 --> 09:29.458
our people would
not be enslaved,

not be a prisoner!

Magneto is not to blame
for your current troubles.

09:47.125 --> 09:50.625
The Mutate called Amphibius
told us he was
obeying the orders

09:50.625 --> 09:52.708
of someone
he called Master.

09:52.708 --> 09:55.000
Perhaps he means Sauron.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.958
He and your Mutates
have enslaved
the people of this land,

09:58.958 --> 10:02.708
taking many to your citadel,
including my beloved Shanna.

10:02.708 --> 10:07.000
Then she must be
the one we saw
carried off by Sauron.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.750
What can we do
to help you?

10:08.750 --> 10:10.708
I should
trust him?

You don't have
much choice.

10:12.750 --> 10:14.750
If Magneto
betrays me again,

10:14.750 --> 10:18.208
you, Xavier,
shall suffer
my vengeance.

Tonight we raid the citadel

10:25.708 --> 10:27.375

The trouble with
this crowd is

11:34.208 --> 11:37.458
you have to shout
to make yourself heard.

11:37.458 --> 11:40.875
Well done, Ruckus.
I'm proud of you.

11:40.875 --> 11:42.708

so fortunate again.

Quickly, my children,

12:01.583 --> 12:04.125

Easy, pal. We'll find her

Your citadel, Magneto,

MAGNETO: It was
not meant to be.

13:40.208 --> 13:43.708
When I built it,
I had great ambitions
for this world.

13:45.208 --> 13:49.000
Unfortunately, Magneto,
the ambitions
of powerful men

13:49.000 --> 13:53.625
usually bring strife
and misery to those
they would improve.

The Master long ago
discovered
your secret passage.

You are not worthy

Now, quickly,
chain them to the wall.

to be done.

What are
you doing?

16:12.416 --> 16:14.625
Brainchild,
that's enough.

Master!

16:17.000 --> 16:21.833
At last you've returned to us.

16:21.833 --> 16:23.458
Mr. Sinister?

16:23.458 --> 16:25.125
I've heard the name.

16:25.125 --> 16:27.583
Frankly, I'm
not impressed.

16:27.583 --> 16:29.708
Professor?

16:29.708 --> 16:35.458
Thank heaven you're alive.
We've been so worried,
so frightened!

16:35.458 --> 16:37.833
I'm sorry to have
caused you concern, Jean.

16:37.833 --> 16:42.708
As you've undoubtedly
noticed, Magneto,
I've made a few changes

16:42.708 --> 16:46.375
since inheriting
this rather
primitive installation.

16:46.375 --> 16:51.083
A tissue sample from Sauron
incorporated
into this device

16:51.083 --> 16:55.291
enables it to draw energy
from any mutants
in the Savage Land,

16:55.291 --> 16:59.500
rendering their powers
inoperative.

16:59.500 --> 17:01.500
The Mutates
seem unaffected.

17:01.500 --> 17:04.416
They have taken
precautions.

17:04.416 --> 17:06.583
I hadn't realized

17:06.583 --> 17:10.833
a side effect would be
your renewed ability
to walk, Professor.

17:10.833 --> 17:12.833
I do hope
you enjoyed it.

17:12.833 --> 17:15.083

from us, Sinister?

Your very essence.
Your...

17:19.208 --> 17:23.875

Exquisitely poor timing,
I'm afraid.

Now you'll have to share
your professor's fate.

17:38.958 --> 17:43.750
Proudly! Better to die
an X-Man than
to live as your slave!

17:45.875 --> 17:48.708
I should have let you die.

17:48.708 --> 17:53.708
All I need now
is for you to contact
your students, Professor,

17:53.708 --> 17:55.458
and bring them here.

17:55.458 --> 17:57.125
You know
I won't do it.

17:57.125 --> 18:00.458
SAURON: You speak
as if you have a choice.

18:00.458 --> 18:02.083
You?

18:02.083 --> 18:05.875
Look at me, Xavier,
and obey!

18:07.125 --> 18:12.250
Resistance is futile.
Obey me.

18:12.250 --> 18:13.583
Obey!

18:14.708 --> 18:17.250
No, never.

18:17.250 --> 18:19.750
No, Professor,
don't listen to him!

18:19.750 --> 18:22.291
Stop! You could
destroy him!

18:22.291 --> 18:24.166
You are a fool, Sinister.

18:24.166 --> 18:26.750
The most powerful mutants
on Earth
shall hunt you down

18:26.750 --> 18:29.875
to see Charles Xavier
avenged.

18:31.875 --> 18:34.625
He resists
like no other!

18:35.750 --> 18:37.750
But in vain.

18:37.750 --> 18:41.750
Won't listen.
Can't listen.

18:41.750 --> 18:45.375
Too many people
who depend on me.

18:45.375 --> 18:49.833
Can't allow you
to control my mind.

18:49.833 --> 18:52.333
Won't allow you to...

18:52.333 --> 18:53.958
(SCREAMING)

18:55.833 --> 18:57.708
What have
you done to him?

18:57.708 --> 18:58.833
Charles?

18:59.833 --> 19:02.416
Oh, Charles.

19:02.416 --> 19:04.708
Wakey, wakey.

19:04.708 --> 19:07.833
What do you want
from me, Master?

19:07.833 --> 19:09.625
(LAUGHING)

19:15.625 --> 19:17.166
ROGUE: What's going on?

19:17.166 --> 19:19.625
Cerebro confirms
it's the
Professor's code.

19:19.625 --> 19:21.000
You found him?

19:21.000 --> 19:22.708
Hello, my friends.

19:22.708 --> 19:24.875
It is good
to see you again.

19:24.875 --> 19:25.958
Professor?

19:25.958 --> 19:27.333
You're alive!

19:27.333 --> 19:29.458
If you will rendezvous
with me

19:29.458 --> 19:31.125
at the following coordinates...

19:31.125 --> 19:32.708
(INAUDIBLE)

19:32.708 --> 19:33.833
Wait.

19:33.833 --> 19:35.875
This is all
very odd.

19:35.875 --> 19:38.708
The Professor
was not at all
like himself.

19:38.708 --> 19:41.375
Gambit, check the origin
of that transmission.

19:41.375 --> 19:43.958
GAMBIT: In a minute.
The Blackbirdjust come in.

19:45.250 --> 19:46.875
-Cyclops.
-Cyclops.

19:46.875 --> 19:49.750
GAMBIT: Guess who
we found?

19:49.750 --> 19:51.416
Hey, wait up!

19:51.416 --> 19:53.083
-We have to talk!
-We have to talk!

19:56.166 --> 19:58.708
CYCLOPS: Morph said something
about Sinister
having the Professor.

19:58.708 --> 20:02.083
So, we're flying
into a trap.

20:02.083 --> 20:03.458
(GRUNTS)

20:03.458 --> 20:05.250
Suits me.

20:05.250 --> 20:07.750
The Professor's
unnatural lack of emotion

20:07.750 --> 20:09.708
suggests coercion.

20:09.708 --> 20:12.458
If the old man
was forced to call us
against his will,

20:12.458 --> 20:16.000
it mean
he need our help bad,
trap or no trap.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.250
If somebody is holding Xavier,

20:18.250 --> 20:22.458
I'm gonna enjoy
making them let go.

20:22.458 --> 20:24.375
We're nearing
the Professor's
coordinates.

20:24.375 --> 20:27.875
How could anyone
survive down there?

20:31.291 --> 20:32.750
I honestly don't know.

20:36.833 --> 20:39.708
Brace yourselves, people,
we're going in!
