ACTUALLY,
DON'T CALL ME BACK.

39:52.694 --> 39:55.262
JUST, UH, M-MEET ME AT
THE CORNER WHERE YOU HAD LUNCH.

39:55.305 --> 39:57.090
I'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU.

39:57.133 --> 39:59.571
DON'T WORRY.
IT'S NOT THE KIDS.

39:59.614 --> 40:03.270
THE KIDS ARE SAFE.

40:03.313 --> 40:07.317
ARDILES ISN'T THE ONLY ONE
BEING BUGGED. IT'S ALL OF US.
