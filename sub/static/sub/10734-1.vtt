00:00.460 --> 00:03.460
<i><b>1x21 - Showdown, part 1</b></i>

00:04.461 --> 00:08.697
Welcome, children, to the
Galvan museum Hall of predators.

00:08.732 --> 00:13.602
Despite our diminutive size,
we Galvans have used our innate

00:13.637 --> 00:19.567
<i>intellect to outwit and defeat every
existing predator in the galaxy.</i>

00:19.602 --> 00:21.743
Except one.

00:21.778 --> 00:25.764
Behold Omnivoracious.

00:29.074 --> 00:32.779
These fossilized bones are
all that remain of what was

00:32.814 --> 00:37.058
once the swiftest, fiercest,
most cunning and determined

00:37.093 --> 00:39.512
<i>predator in the known universe.</i>

00:39.813 --> 00:42.531
<i>Indeed, the Galvan race might</i>

00:42.567 --> 00:47.768
<i>never have survived, but for
a freak asteroid collision...</i>

00:49.972 --> 00:53.409
<i>...and a fluke of extreme
climate change that wiped out</i>

00:53.444 --> 00:56.011
Omnivoracious millions of years ago.

00:56.046 --> 00:59.381
<i>Now if you'll follow me into
the Azmuth pavilion of</i>

00:59.416 --> 01:01.819
<i>astounding Galvan brilliance.</i>

01:01.855 --> 01:04.958
"Astounding Galvan brilliance"?

01:04.994 --> 01:09.833
More like
persistently pervasive dumb luck.

01:09.868 --> 01:13.538
But then again, I have always
asserted that the Galvans are

01:13.573 --> 01:16.742
far more lucky than s-smart.

01:16.779 --> 01:20.214
That luck
is about to run out.

01:20.250 --> 01:24.053
You there!
Step away from the fossils!

01:27.426 --> 01:31.046
Soon the entire Galvan
race will wish they

01:31.047 --> 01:34.667
had perished along with
their former predators.

<i>Ehh!
This patrol is a real yawn fest.</i>

02:07.374 --> 02:09.308
There are
festivals for yawning?

02:09.342 --> 02:12.146
It means "I'm bored."

02:15.183 --> 02:17.016
Would you please stop that?

02:17.052 --> 02:19.652
Can't help it.
When I'm bored, I fiddle.

02:25.861 --> 02:27.328
<i>It is a wonder you have</i>

02:27.363 --> 02:29.664
not destroyed the Omnitrix
with your "fiddling".

02:33.270 --> 02:36.104
Actually, I have.
More than once.

02:36.140 --> 02:38.374
Perhaps we could pass
the time more constructively

02:38.409 --> 02:40.776
with conversation.
We have been partners for

02:40.811 --> 02:43.746
a while now, yet we barely know
the first thing about one another.

02:43.781 --> 02:45.881
What do you want to know?
Favorite color?

02:45.917 --> 02:47.683
Favorite food?
Hobbies?

02:47.719 --> 02:51.020
Green, chili fries, collecting
something called "sumo slammers."

02:51.055 --> 02:53.589
All obvious within
minutes of meeting you.

02:53.625 --> 02:56.859
Right.
You want more personal stuff.

02:56.895 --> 03:01.197
Worst fear, first crush,
distinctive body marks.

03:01.232 --> 03:03.600
Peacocks,
Patty Berkenfeld ... 3rd grade,

03:03.635 --> 03:07.171
scar on your lower back in the shape
of something called "New Jersey."

03:07.206 --> 03:09.307
What?
- I read your file.

03:09.342 --> 03:12.077
Those Plumber background
checks are thorough.

03:12.112 --> 03:14.379
As in T.M.I. thorough.

03:14.415 --> 03:19.085
I did notice one O-mission
in your files that piqued my curiosity.

03:19.120 --> 03:21.154
Ask me anything.
I'm an open book.

03:21.189 --> 03:26.393
Tell me about "Feedback."
- That book's closed.

03:26.429 --> 03:29.564
By all indications,
Feedback was your most utilized

03:29.599 --> 03:32.634
alien form for a long stretch
of time in your early career.

03:32.670 --> 03:36.372
Then suddenly and without
explanation, your use abruptly

03:36.407 --> 03:38.507
ceased for good.
Curious, no?

03:38.543 --> 03:41.978
No. And I don't
want to talk about it.

03:42.013 --> 03:44.581
And I didn't use him that much.

03:46.000 --> 03:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:57.698 --> 04:00.599
We could really use Xlr8
for this one, Ben.

04:00.635 --> 04:06.773
Way ahead of you,
grandpa. It's hero time!

04:06.808 --> 04:09.209
How are you supposed
to catch a turbocharged

04:09.244 --> 04:12.112
getaway car with a living
extension cord, doofus?

04:12.147 --> 04:15.949
Doesn't matter how.
As long as I look good doing it.

04:28.598 --> 04:32.433
It's hero time!

04:32.468 --> 04:35.870
Feedback absorbs
electricity, doofus.

04:35.905 --> 04:40.942
Heatblast absorbs fire. Why do
you like Feedback so much anyway?

04:40.977 --> 04:43.978
Um, because he's awesome and cool?

04:44.014 --> 04:47.783
But you wouldn't know anything
about that, obviously, dweeb.

04:52.288 --> 04:55.791
I would very much like to
see this Feedback form of yours, Ben.

04:55.826 --> 04:58.961
Why will you not show him to me?

04:58.997 --> 05:02.399
Need I remind you that
partnership is based upon mutual

05:02.400 --> 05:05.801
trust, and keeping secrets
is detrimental to that trust.

05:05.836 --> 05:08.070
Stop the car!

05:10.774 --> 05:12.741
Trust me.

05:13.377 --> 05:15.054
Come on, Waterhazard.

05:17.647 --> 05:20.015
You know, Omnitrix, Heatblast is as

05:20.050 --> 05:24.119
not-waterhazard as possible.
Just sayin'.

05:30.392 --> 05:33.461
You there!
Stop it!

05:33.497 --> 05:35.997
Ben Tennyson?
Noooo!

05:38.002 --> 05:41.070
Wait!
I was trying to put a fire out!

05:46.344 --> 05:49.111
Go away!
Leave Pakmar alone!

05:49.146 --> 05:51.312
Or Pakmar call Plumbers on you!

05:51.348 --> 05:53.481
It's me!
Ben Tennyson!

05:53.517 --> 05:55.917
Pakmar knows Ben Tennyson!

05:56.720 --> 06:00.322
You ruin Pakmar's new
business venture. Again!

06:10.533 --> 06:12.133
<i>Attention, citizen!</i>

06:12.169 --> 06:15.804
<i>Pull over your flaming vehicle,
or I will be forced to disable it!</i>

06:18.075 --> 06:20.475
No!
Not flaming vehicle!

06:20.510 --> 06:22.977
Barbecue!
Can't you read?

06:23.013 --> 06:25.129
Uh, Rook?

06:33.848 --> 06:36.657
Bad idea on all fronts!

06:46.731 --> 06:48.397
What'd you do that for?!

06:48.433 --> 06:50.400
<i>I put out the fire, did I not?</i>

06:50.435 --> 06:54.537
Yeah, you also put out my fire!

06:54.573 --> 06:58.342
And the little guy's still
trapped in his truck!

07:25.939 --> 07:30.175
Let go!
Pakmar doesn't need your help!

07:31.379 --> 07:34.746
Now here's a guy with
trust issues.

07:36.349 --> 07:40.018
<i>I know you're a busy Galvan,
first thinker Azmuth.</i>

07:40.053 --> 07:42.988
But given the evidence that
"he" was here...

07:43.023 --> 07:46.525
Much as I hate to say it,
you were right to disturb me.

07:46.560 --> 07:48.894
Malware may yet be in the vicinity.

07:48.929 --> 07:51.996
Alert the guards and have them
conduct a thorough search.

07:55.535 --> 07:56.534
Curious.

08:02.640 --> 08:03.940
Malware.

08:03.976 --> 08:08.778
<i>Wrong! You Galvans
think you know everything.</i>

08:08.814 --> 08:13.003
But I, Dr. Psychobos,
am aboutto p-prove

08:13.004 --> 08:19.288
the undisputed superiority of
the Cerebrocrustacean intellect.

08:22.125 --> 08:25.360
<i>Note the Mongrel's collar, Azmuth.</i>

08:25.395 --> 08:29.664
Does it look at all familiar?
How many centuries did it take

08:29.699 --> 08:34.102
you to perfect your greatest
invention, the Omnitrix?

08:34.136 --> 08:36.837
<i>It took m-me weeks to improve</i>

08:36.873 --> 08:41.510
<i>upon that perfection, and
I use that term loosely.</i>

08:41.544 --> 08:45.847
Eh. Not bad.
For a cheap knockoff.

08:45.883 --> 08:49.118
You Galvans
have always boasted that you've

08:49.153 --> 08:53.289
managed to outlive all your
natural p-predators.

08:53.324 --> 08:57.493
Let's put that theory
to a test, shall we?

09:16.015 --> 09:18.649
Psychobos!
Stop this nonsense!

09:18.684 --> 09:21.485
Dr. Psychobos:
That's Doctor Psychobos.

09:21.521 --> 09:26.657
And you concede the superiority
of the Cerebrocrustacean intellect?

09:26.693 --> 09:29.827
I concede that I
don't care, Psychobos.

09:29.862 --> 09:34.182
I concede that proving
which species is smarter

09:34.183 --> 09:38.503
is a colossal waste of
time, energy, and resources.

09:39.072 --> 09:42.007
<i>You don't think I took precautions</i>

09:42.042 --> 09:46.345
<i>to prevent you from using that
device to teleport out of here?</i>

09:47.114 --> 09:52.218
Did you think to prevent me
from teleporting anyone in?

09:54.089 --> 09:58.491
Put Pakmar's truck down!
Before you do any more damage!

09:58.526 --> 10:01.628
How could we possibly
do any more damage?

10:12.041 --> 10:14.708
<i>Just like a Galvan to cheat!</i>

10:14.743 --> 10:17.244
Perhaps
you have been cheated.

10:17.279 --> 10:21.748
But I have just been handed an
incredible stroke of good fortune.

10:21.784 --> 10:27.020
My ultimate prey, Ben Tennyson,
is now trapped in this arena.

10:27.055 --> 10:30.257
You will keep your focus on Azmuth!

10:30.292 --> 10:33.628
I am perfectly
capable of, as the earthlings say,

10:33.663 --> 10:36.931
killing two birds with one stone.

10:46.043 --> 10:49.144
Azmuth?
- I'll explain everything later.

10:49.179 --> 10:52.381
You always say
that, but you never do.

11:04.994 --> 11:08.197
You are Azmuth.
I cannot believe I am in the

11:08.232 --> 11:10.833
presence of the greatest
mind in the universe.

11:10.868 --> 11:16.171
<i>No, he is not!
And I am about to prove it.</i>

11:16.206 --> 11:21.143
That is, if a certain partner,
and I use the term loosely,

11:21.178 --> 11:23.478
would learn to cooperate.

11:41.230 --> 11:43.897
Eat exploding gummy-ball thing!

11:49.804 --> 11:53.273
Probably should have seen that coming.

11:56.310 --> 11:59.513
Guys?
A little help! Oh!

12:03.551 --> 12:05.887
Make that a lot of help!

12:05.922 --> 12:07.345
Oh. Right.

12:08.508 --> 12:12.360
I must stop the hunter who controls
the Nemetrix with his whistling.

12:12.396 --> 12:14.396
Oh, is that all?
Cover me.

12:14.432 --> 12:16.999
I have a plan.
- What about Ben?

12:17.034 --> 12:19.735
Eh. The kid can handle himself.

12:19.736 --> 12:21.537
Mind if I borrow this?

12:22.574 --> 12:25.442
Oh, give me someone
useful for a change!

12:29.781 --> 12:33.416
No shortage of
predators to match my prey.

12:45.597 --> 12:50.634
Perhaps we should intervene?
- Relax.

12:55.772 --> 12:59.408
I really think
we ought to help Ben.

12:59.443 --> 13:02.377
Seriously?
You're going to argue with

13:02.412 --> 13:06.347
the greatest mind in three,
possibly five galaxies?

13:06.383 --> 13:07.882
<i>Big deal!</i>

13:07.918 --> 13:12.553
I am the greatest mind in
the entire universe!

13:23.131 --> 13:24.131
He cheated.

13:30.406 --> 13:33.307
You two keep the Mutt busy.
I have a plan.

13:50.559 --> 13:51.659
Khyber!

13:51.695 --> 13:56.664
Stop these foolish games
and c-concentrate on Azmuth!

13:58.068 --> 14:01.936
Never... do... that... again!

14:14.384 --> 14:18.853
You dare defy
the greatest mind in the universe?

14:18.888 --> 14:23.191
Then I will force you to cooperate!

14:30.332 --> 14:32.266
Azmuth!

14:37.139 --> 14:42.277
<i>Don't just stand there!
Throw me the whistle!</i>

14:50.186 --> 14:52.954
Gentlemen, meet Vicetopus.

14:52.989 --> 14:57.091
The natural predator of all
Cerebrocrustaceans.

15:00.329 --> 15:03.371
As smart as you claim to be, Psychobos,

15:03.372 --> 15:05.400
I'm sure you knew that already.

15:05.435 --> 15:08.203
<i>But do you know how to defeat him?</i>

15:11.508 --> 15:15.577
Khyber! Help me!
Whistle and call it off!

15:15.612 --> 15:18.540
I'm sure the greatest
intellect in the universe

15:18.661 --> 15:22.385
can outwit his mindless
natural predator.

15:24.420 --> 15:26.421
Who's a good predator?

15:26.456 --> 15:29.090
You are. Yes, you are.

15:35.765 --> 15:39.567
So Dr. Psychobos
is teamed up with Khyber.

15:39.603 --> 15:42.871
Not anymore. Looks
like your partner ditched you.

15:42.906 --> 15:46.374
I knew we
never should have t-trusted him.

15:46.410 --> 15:48.143
What do you mean "we"?

15:48.178 --> 15:51.597
Even with your human
brain's limited c-capacity,

15:51.598 --> 15:55.017
surely you could piece
it together that Khyber

15:55.052 --> 15:57.619
and I have been in league with...

15:57.654 --> 16:01.590
Malware.
- I can't imagine how the three

16:01.625 --> 16:05.494
of you managed to get past
the Galvan planetary defenses.

16:05.529 --> 16:08.497
When last we
encountered Malware, he said

16:08.532 --> 16:12.000
that you had already lost
without even knowing it.

16:12.035 --> 16:14.569
<i>I am part of Plumber special forces.</i>

16:14.604 --> 16:17.606
<i>All of our ships have
Galvan security codes.</i>

16:17.641 --> 16:21.677
<i>He must have downloaded them from
my onboard computer memory core.</i>

16:21.712 --> 16:23.379
Where is Malware now?

16:23.414 --> 16:27.951
And I should tell you why?

16:32.758 --> 16:34.892
All right.
That's enough, boy.

16:38.096 --> 16:41.198
We need to find Malware.
- Slow down, Ben.

16:41.233 --> 16:44.301
You don't want a repeat of
what happened to Feedback.

16:44.336 --> 16:47.237
And what exactly
happened to Feedback?

16:47.273 --> 16:49.406
You never told your partner?

16:51.077 --> 16:53.243
Feedback was my go-to alien.

16:53.279 --> 16:56.146
I don't know why I
liked being him so much.

16:56.181 --> 16:59.063
He just felt different.

16:59.064 --> 17:03.386
Better.
Like he was part of me.

17:13.864 --> 17:15.365
Pull!

17:25.409 --> 17:27.577
Man.

17:33.083 --> 17:36.085
Azmuth?
What are you doing here?

17:36.120 --> 17:38.487
We need to talk to you
about Feedback.

17:38.523 --> 17:42.324
It's not healthy to grow too
dependent on any one alien form.

17:42.360 --> 17:45.794
If you keep overusing the
Conductoid DNA, it will have

17:45.829 --> 17:50.432
a detrimental effect on your
ability to control other forms.

17:50.467 --> 17:53.134
What?
So don't use Feedback anymore?

17:53.170 --> 17:55.438
Forget that!

17:57.439 --> 17:59.974
Ben, wait!

18:00.009 --> 18:02.276
You made them say that,
didn't you, Gwen?

18:02.312 --> 18:05.446
'Cause you're so jealous you
can't turn into aliens like me.

18:05.481 --> 18:09.416
You honestly think Azmuth
would listen to me or anyone else?

18:09.451 --> 18:11.284
You did this to yourself, Ben.

18:11.320 --> 18:12.986
I'm the one
wearing the Omnitrix.

18:13.021 --> 18:17.857
I can turn into whichever alien
I want. And no one can stop me!

18:17.893 --> 18:20.686
<i>I beg to differ.</i>

18:26.795 --> 18:29.067
I am here for Azmuth.

18:31.504 --> 18:35.440
You picked the wrong
hero to mess with again.

18:35.476 --> 18:37.676
So you pick the right hero, Ben!

18:37.711 --> 18:40.412
Remember, the only time you
ever beat him was as Diamondhead!

18:45.852 --> 18:47.185
Yeah!

18:47.221 --> 18:50.522
This is no time to try
to make a point!

18:51.891 --> 18:56.528
Relax, Gwen. See?
What goes around comes around!

18:56.563 --> 19:01.266
Excellent suggestion.

19:01.302 --> 19:03.569
Come on, Ben!
Turn into Diamondhead!

19:03.605 --> 19:05.137
Quick!
Before Malware ...

19:05.173 --> 19:07.373
Destroys the Omnitrix?

19:20.154 --> 19:24.623
My, my. Isn't this a
surprising turn of events?

19:24.658 --> 19:26.292
If I am not mistaken,

19:26.293 --> 19:29.561
this seems to be your
favorite alien, Ben Tennyson.

19:29.596 --> 19:30.995
Correct?

19:31.030 --> 19:34.798
Not anymore.

19:34.834 --> 19:36.800
No!!

19:36.836 --> 19:40.103
Though I am here for Azmuth,
I wish to destroy him

19:40.139 --> 19:43.240
with his most precious creation.

19:43.275 --> 19:46.576
The Omnitrix. Now.

19:49.281 --> 19:52.516
You want it so bad?
Here!

19:57.556 --> 20:00.023
Yes. Yes!

20:00.058 --> 20:03.463
The power of the Omnitrix flows
through me.

20:03.495 --> 20:06.274
It is me.

20:06.275 --> 20:11.368
No! It's overloading me!
Stop!!

20:16.141 --> 20:17.441
Ben! Don't!

20:30.055 --> 20:34.425
Though we thought Malware was
destroyed, as a fail-safe, the

20:34.426 --> 20:38.796
Omnitrix would never accept DNA
from the Conductoid species again.

20:38.832 --> 20:41.265
That's what happened to Feedback.

20:41.300 --> 20:44.335
And it was all my fault.
Happy now?

20:44.370 --> 20:47.838
I am sorry, Ben.
I did not realize.

20:47.873 --> 20:52.042
Just forget it, all right?
I wish I could.

21:00.085 --> 21:01.384
Malware?

21:04.189 --> 21:07.324
Khyber.
And he took the Nemetrix.

21:12.463 --> 21:16.267
Remove your inferior
Amphibian digits from my p-person!

21:16.302 --> 21:19.536
This is no way to treat your
intellectual superior!

21:19.572 --> 21:20.571
Get in, dummy!

21:31.550 --> 21:34.753
What do we do now?
Khyber and Malware are still out there.

21:34.788 --> 21:39.025
We may yet convince the Mutt
to sniff out his old master.

21:39.060 --> 21:44.230
<i>Enjoy your delusions
of superiority while they last, Azmuth.</i>

21:44.278 --> 21:50.277
Your entire species, and I use
that term loosely,

21:50.278 --> 21:54.041
is about to become extinct!

22:04.189 --> 22:07.140
