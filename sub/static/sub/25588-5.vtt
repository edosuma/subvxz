<i>This is George Beard

00:17.559 --> 00:20.270
<i>Er, no, it's not.</i>

00:20.353 --> 00:22.897
<i>This is George Beard

00:22.981 --> 00:25.341
<i>George is the kid on the left
with the tie and the flat top.</i>

00:25.400 --> 00:28.486
<i>Harold is the one on the right
with the T-shirt and the bad haircut.</i>

00:28.570 --> 00:30.050
<i>Remember that now.</i>

00:32.698 --> 00:35.660
Check out the Rank Tank.
Melvin's still number one.

00:35.785 --> 00:37.954
And we're still below
the good grades line.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.040
Not for long. Compliments, my friend.

00:40.123 --> 00:42.876
Once we compliment Ms. Ribble,
she'll give us good grades.

00:42.959 --> 00:44.586
Then, Lake Summer Camp, here we come!

00:44.669 --> 00:47.839
Compliments solve everything.
Just like on The Schmoozer!

00:47.922 --> 00:52.761
<i>I'm going to harpoon the city!</i>

00:57.140 --> 00:58.516

00:58.600 --> 01:02.062
<i>- Aw, you think so? Aw!
- Super bushy.</i>

01:02.854 --> 01:04.022
And here she comes.

01:04.105 --> 01:07.067
- Hey, Ms. Ribble. Nice mustache.
- Super bushy!

01:07.150 --> 01:09.027
- What? That's gonna cost you!
- Oops.

01:09.110 --> 01:11.488

on television.

<i>Chapter 1, Bad Credit.</i>

01:48.650 --> 01:50.693
Well, I ran the numbers,
and they just don't add up.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.529
Those are just random numbers.

01:53.446 --> 01:55.824
The point is, there's no way
to raise our grades enough

01:55.907 --> 01:57.242
to get us to summer camp.

01:57.325 --> 01:59.327
I hear you get to fly fighter jets there.

02:01.579 --> 02:05.416
- Okay, Hot Sauce, light them up!
- Roger that, Relish. Targets locked.

02:05.500 --> 02:06.793
Firing water balloons.

02:09.711 --> 02:13.925
Okay, class, we're starting a new unit
on dinosaurs today.

02:14.008 --> 02:16.511
And for anyone interested
in boosting their grade,

02:16.594 --> 02:19.889
whoever submits the best dinosaur project
wins extra credit.

02:20.181 --> 02:21.182
What's extra credit?

02:21.474 --> 02:24.727
You do extra work, like a book report,
to raise your grade.

02:24.811 --> 02:27.397
Extra work is my specialty.
But then, what isn't?

02:27.730 --> 02:30.024
I'm great. Great. Great. Great.

02:30.108 --> 02:33.653
Well, that's not happening.
Extra work is worse than regular work.

02:33.736 --> 02:35.530
And book reports are the worst.

02:35.613 --> 02:38.616
True, but what if we did
a comic book report?

02:38.700 --> 02:39.701
So good.

02:39.784 --> 02:43.621
<i>Chapter 2, Captain Underpants
and the Jokey Jokeasaurus.</i>

02:43.705 --> 02:45.145
<i>By George Beard And Harold Hutchins.</i>

02:45.206 --> 02:47.393
<i>So, one day, this scientist guy wanted
to write a dinosaur book.</i>

02:47.417 --> 02:49.603
<i>So he went to the time machine store,
rented a time machine,</i>

02:49.627 --> 02:52.463
<i>and went back to dinosaur times
in a machine, ba-zip!</i>

02:52.547 --> 02:54.299
<i>Tinkle-tinkle-tinkle warp!</i>

02:54.382 --> 02:57.719
<i>When he got there, sure it was like jungly
and smelled like eggs.</i>

02:57.802 --> 02:58.821
<i>But the dinosaurs weren't all,</i>

02:58.845 --> 03:01.848
<i>"skarr" and "boo-weep"
and "ya-kak-kak-kak" like animal noises.</i>

03:01.931 --> 03:03.266
<i>They could talk and were like us.</i>

03:03.349 --> 03:05.560
<i>They had mini-golf and pizza places
and snack bars,</i>

03:05.643 --> 03:09.981
<i>and even bad stuff like overdue books
from the library and stuff.</i>

03:10.064 --> 03:12.358
<i>Then the scientist met a dino
named Diddlysaurus,</i>

03:12.442 --> 03:15.028
<i>who loved to prank and talk
like "squee-bop" and "diddly-boo".</i>

03:15.111 --> 03:18.323
<i>He knew all the best pranks,
like putting mayo in a donut, gag,</i>

03:18.406 --> 03:20.086
<i>and hiding all the furniture
in the garage.</i>

03:20.116 --> 03:21.367
<i>"Where's my chair?" Bonk!</i>

03:21.451 --> 03:23.053
<i>Then Diddly wanted
to borrow the time machine.</i>

03:23.077 --> 03:24.388
<i>Scientist said, "No way, nuh-uh."</i>

03:24.412 --> 03:27.498
<i>So Diddly pulled the old, "Hey, look!
What's that over there and stuff" prank,</i>

03:27.582 --> 03:29.125
<i>and stole the time machine anyway.</i>

03:29.208 --> 03:31.085
<i>Ba-zip! Tinkle-tinkle-tinkle warp!</i>

03:31.169 --> 03:33.755
<i>Diddly went to ancient Egypt
and turned the pyramids upside down</i>

03:33.838 --> 03:36.466
<i>and King Arthur's Court,
and tied their shoelaces together. Clonk!</i>

03:36.549 --> 03:41.012
<i>He went to, like, old Italy and scared
Mona Lisa, and tickled her elbow.</i>

03:41.095 --> 03:43.616
<i>Then he got to, like, now, and he switched
out all the ham with balloons</i>

03:43.640 --> 03:45.099
<i>at the mini-golf snack bar.</i>

03:45.183 --> 03:46.327
<i>But Captain Underpants was there!</i>

03:46.351 --> 03:50.480
<i>He'd ordered a ham sandwich, and he goes,
"Wait, what? I don't want ham and balloon!</i>

03:50.563 --> 03:52.482
<i>You've crossed the tra-la-line,
tra-la-lizard!"</i>

03:52.565 --> 03:54.084
<i>Captain Underpants pulled out
a bunch of underwear,</i>

03:54.108 --> 03:55.526
<i>tied them into an under-whip.</i>

03:55.610 --> 03:59.155
<i>"Let's get slappy!" Ka-swap!
And it was on like a mastodon.</i>

03:59.239 --> 04:00.865
<i>Tighty-whitey versus Taily-whaley!</i>

04:00.949 --> 04:03.302
<i>But Diddly smacked him
with his tail back into the snack bar,</i>

04:03.326 --> 04:06.037
<i>and he smashed
into the Freezilee Slush Bucket machine.</i>

04:06.120 --> 04:08.831
<i>Splort! Mm! Cherry-ish!</i>

04:08.915 --> 04:11.000
<i>Then as Diddly got real skiddly-bop close,</i>

04:11.084 --> 04:14.003
<i>Captain Underpants blasted him
with the Freezilee Slush Bucket machine,</i>

04:14.087 --> 04:16.297
<i>and stopped him cold! Bwaize!</i>

04:16.380 --> 04:18.132
<i>Like ice cold! Freezilee!</i>

04:18.591 --> 04:20.218
<i>But, mm, cherry-ish!</i>

04:20.301 --> 04:23.680
<i>Ice cold Diddly slid
all the way down a hill and splash!</i>

04:23.763 --> 04:26.182
<i>Floated away in a river to nowhere.</i>

04:26.266 --> 04:27.558
<i>Tra-la-la! The End.</i>

04:27.642 --> 04:30.895
I know you're not supposed
to toot your own horn, but toot-toot!

04:30.979 --> 04:32.563
So, do we get the extra credit?

04:32.647 --> 04:34.357
And did you say toot your own horn butt?

04:34.440 --> 04:36.776
No. You're getting extra discredit.

04:36.859 --> 04:39.696
Dinosaurs didn't talk, eat pizza
or play mini-golf.

04:44.492 --> 04:45.702
Behold!

04:46.077 --> 04:49.497
Aw, man. Melvin figured out
the secret formula for making ice!

04:49.580 --> 04:52.041
- He's for sure gonna win.
- No, you two-legged chair.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.460
I excavated this sample
from Piqua Glacier.

04:54.544 --> 04:58.172
And when it thaws tomorrow,
I'll have an actual dinosaur!

04:59.507 --> 05:00.800
- So?
- And you won't.

05:00.883 --> 05:04.220
And the extra credit will keep me
at the top of the Rank Tank!

05:04.304 --> 05:07.348
Melvin's number one! Melvin's number one!

05:10.601 --> 05:12.520
- Melvin's number one!
- Oh, yeah?

05:12.603 --> 05:17.066
Well, we've got something amazing, too.
So amazing it's impossible to describe!

05:17.233 --> 05:19.360
- Well, what is it?
- It's impossible to describe!

05:19.444 --> 05:22.030
It may seem like that bothers me,
but it does not.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.216
Why didn't you tell me
we had something amazing?

05:24.240 --> 05:27.452
'Cause we don't.
All we have is a failed comic book.

05:27.535 --> 05:29.787
Wait. What if we copy
what happened in our comic?

05:29.871 --> 05:32.749
We borrow Melvin's Time Toad,
go back to prehistoric time,

05:32.832 --> 05:36.294
and bring back a live dinosaur
before Melvin's dino thaws.

05:36.377 --> 05:38.963
Yes! The simplest plans work best.

05:39.672 --> 05:41.424
You're being ridiculous.

05:41.507 --> 05:44.469
George and Harold can't subvert
your scholastic supremacy.

05:44.552 --> 05:45.386
Wrong!

05:45.470 --> 05:48.264
George and Harold have a history
of accidentally succeeding.

05:48.389 --> 05:50.975
And always at my expense!

05:51.184 --> 05:54.270
Sweet pumpkin pie, you're right!
No one fails upwards like those two!

05:54.353 --> 05:57.148
- Krupp!
- Got rid of that ant hill like you asked.

05:57.231 --> 05:58.649
Because I fell on it.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.818
My skin is on fire.

06:00.902 --> 06:03.462
That's nice, but we have a task for you.
Consider it a promotion.

06:03.488 --> 06:05.031
I'm gonna be principal again?

06:06.866 --> 06:07.866
What? No!

06:07.992 --> 06:10.828
I'm the principal!
You're the vice principal.

06:10.912 --> 06:13.331
We want you to spy on George and Harold,

06:13.414 --> 06:15.750
find out what they're up to
and stop them from succeeding.

06:15.833 --> 06:18.211
So principal?

06:18.294 --> 06:20.838
No! You're still sharing a desk
with Ms. Anthrope.

06:20.922 --> 06:23.925
What? She's washing socks in a bucket!

06:24.342 --> 06:25.468
I'm out.

06:25.551 --> 06:27.351
- We'll give you a new parking spot.
- I'm in.

06:27.386 --> 06:28.666
Good. And get rid of those ants.

06:28.805 --> 06:31.599
What are you...
What ants? Where?

06:31.724 --> 06:34.018
<i>Chapter 3,
A Krupp in Kid's Clothing.</i>

06:35.728 --> 06:39.107
How did Melvin not think of this?
I mean, it's his time machine!

06:39.190 --> 06:41.609
<i>Good question,
but let's not pull that thread.</i>

06:41.692 --> 06:44.570
Hello, fellow kids!

06:44.654 --> 06:45.488
Mr. Krupp?

06:45.571 --> 06:50.618
Who's Mr. Krupp?
I'm just a kid. A real kid. Like you.

06:50.701 --> 06:53.788
Now let's slappy hands like us kids do.

06:56.666 --> 07:00.336
There!
So, what's on the docket, chums?

07:00.711 --> 07:05.466
Mischief making? Huh?
A general lack of respect for the rules?

07:05.550 --> 07:09.011
Whatever it is, I'm game,
because I'm a kid as you can clearly see.

07:09.095 --> 07:11.347
Listen to my young giddy laugh.

07:14.809 --> 07:17.395
Actually, we were gonna drop rocks
on our feet.

07:17.478 --> 07:20.398
Yeah, you know how kids love
dropping rocks on their feet.

07:20.481 --> 07:21.732
'Cause you're a kid, right?

07:22.650 --> 07:23.484
Ha!

07:23.568 --> 07:26.821
Boy, do I! Hold me back.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.117
Ow, ow! Oh!

07:33.202 --> 07:36.581
Be right back, kids like me.
Ow, ow, ow.

07:36.664 --> 07:37.915
Time to get us a dinosaur.

07:37.999 --> 07:40.418
Hello, Time Toad!

07:45.173 --> 07:47.425
<i>Welcome to the Jurassic Period.</i>

07:47.508 --> 07:48.384
Whoa!

07:48.468 --> 07:52.346
I mean, I know we've been turned
into clay, and battled a talking fart,

07:52.430 --> 07:54.056
- but this is amazing.
- Yep.

07:54.223 --> 07:56.225
So, which one should we take home
with us?

07:57.685 --> 07:59.312
- How about that big one?
- Perfect.

08:01.272 --> 08:04.358
- We've made a huge mistake!
- Go, go, go!

08:05.359 --> 08:07.069
Oh!

08:07.153 --> 08:09.906
Why'd we think they'd be friendly?
They're trying to eat us!

08:09.989 --> 08:12.950
We gotta get back and stop Melvin
from defrosting the dino!

08:13.034 --> 08:15.828
That thing could be alive!
We could all get eaten.

08:18.623 --> 08:19.808
<i>But in the panic to escape,</i>

08:19.832 --> 08:22.168
<i>George and Harold didn't notice
their comic book,</i>

08:22.251 --> 08:25.213
<i>falling out of Harold's pocket
and landing innocently on the ground.</i>

08:27.798 --> 08:30.927
Soon, your icy shell will thaw,
my Cretaceous comrade,

08:31.010 --> 08:33.346
and the extra credit will be mine.

08:33.429 --> 08:37.767
The dawn of a new age begins at dawn.

08:38.976 --> 08:41.102
- Melvin!
- Ah, the witless wonders.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.855
You can't thaw that dino!

08:42.938 --> 08:45.608
Dinosaurs are ferocious monsters
who want to kill us and eat us!

08:45.858 --> 08:46.692
Puh-shaw!

08:46.776 --> 08:48.069
Did you just say, "puh-shaw?"

08:48.152 --> 08:50.446
Dinosaurs have brains the size of peas

08:50.530 --> 08:52.782
while my brain is the size
of ripe cantaloupe.

08:52.865 --> 08:54.742
That primitive beast
will do whatever I say.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.410
- No, Melvin, it's...
- Save it.

08:56.494 --> 08:59.288
I know you're trying to get
in my head to foil my extra credit.

09:00.498 --> 09:02.833
If we're gonna save Piqua
and everyone in it,

09:03.376 --> 09:07.380
we're gonna have to take that dino-sicle
back to the glaciers ourselves.

09:11.676 --> 09:12.760
Man, this is heavy!

09:12.969 --> 09:14.329
Let's just take it there tomorrow.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.074
Those two are up to something.

09:16.222 --> 09:21.060
And when I figure out what it is,
I'll be parking in paradise.

09:24.605 --> 09:25.773
Oh, Kruppy,

09:25.856 --> 09:29.026
if it weren't for this parking spot,
we never would have met,

09:29.110 --> 09:32.321
and later married
and opened a joint checking account.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.489
I know.

09:35.491 --> 09:37.034
- What's this?
- Mm?

09:41.330 --> 09:44.750
A kid driving a car? Not in my town.

09:48.337 --> 09:51.549
That fan will keep the ice cold
until the glacier opens in the morning.

09:51.632 --> 09:53.884
Cool. Let's watch <i>Screaming Things</i>
while we wait.

09:54.552 --> 09:57.221
Whoa! You guys! Did you hear that?

09:58.180 --> 10:00.808
Good call. But we had to unplug the TV
to use the fan.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.227
Because for some reason,
we only have one outlet.

10:03.394 --> 10:06.105
Come on, we'll just watch one episode
and plug the fan back in.

10:06.188 --> 10:08.024
Okay. But just one episode.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.740
Okay, just one more.

10:17.742 --> 10:19.702
Hmm. Just one more?

10:22.246 --> 10:23.706
Just one more!

10:26.417 --> 10:29.295
I did not see
that last scream coming.

10:29.378 --> 10:31.422
Nope.

10:31.589 --> 10:32.789
Wait, there's another episode?

10:39.513 --> 10:42.808
- Please don't eat us!
- Yeah, we taste like old ham!

10:42.892 --> 10:44.393
- Gotcha!
- Huh?

10:45.603 --> 10:48.648
Oh, man. I pranked you guys so good.

10:48.814 --> 10:51.150
- You talk?
- When I'm not scatting.

10:51.233 --> 10:52.068
Like this!

10:53.819 --> 10:55.946
- And you prank?
- Best in the business.

10:56.030 --> 10:58.824
I'm Diddly. Last name, Saurus. Wha?

10:58.908 --> 11:03.371
Wait, y-y-y-you're George Beard
and Harold Hutchins?

11:03.454 --> 11:04.580
You know who we are?

11:04.664 --> 11:08.334
Jokey Jokesaurus?
We based our whole world on this thing.

11:08.709 --> 11:12.421
You taught us to talk, play mini-golf,
make pizza. Prank!

11:12.505 --> 11:13.381
<i>That's right.</i>

11:13.464 --> 11:15.841
<i>When George and Harold dropped
that comic book,</i>

11:15.925 --> 11:18.677
<i>it became a magical book of knowledge
for dinosaurs,</i>

11:18.761 --> 11:19.821
<i>changing everything about them,</i>

11:19.845 --> 11:23.557
<i>including the historically inaccurate fact
of them being trapped in ice.</i>

11:23.641 --> 11:26.244
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- That we made dinosaurs smart?

11:26.268 --> 11:28.687
And we're totally gonna win
the extra credit!

11:28.771 --> 11:31.232
- How? Diddly is Melvin's dinosaur.
- Whoa-ho-ho!

11:31.315 --> 11:34.360
Hold up. Diddly ain't anybody's dino
but Diddly's.

11:35.528 --> 11:36.612
So, you'll help us?

11:36.695 --> 11:39.490
Anything for you guys.
Just one small favor in return.

11:39.573 --> 11:42.993
It would be a dream come true
if I could do a prank with you. Deal?

11:43.285 --> 11:45.496
Deal. But you're gonna need a disguise.

11:45.579 --> 11:48.624
I mean, if people see a dinosaur,
they'll call the cops.

11:48.707 --> 11:50.668
And I've got the perfect disguise.

11:53.462 --> 11:56.507
Really? A hat?
That's the perfect disguise?

11:56.590 --> 11:58.134
Yup. It's like he's invisible.

12:02.888 --> 12:04.849
Okay, guys, let's pick our prank targets,

12:04.932 --> 12:06.600
and let the good times roll.

12:08.144 --> 12:11.272
Hey, kids like me!

12:12.940 --> 12:17.027
Giggle-giggle. I'm a kid.
And you're a dinosaur!

12:17.111 --> 12:18.696
No. He's a kid.

12:18.779 --> 12:20.739
But only a kid would know that.

12:20.823 --> 12:23.409
You think I don't know that?
Of course I know that.

12:23.492 --> 12:27.663
Kid. Um, uh, duh! Kids say that!

12:27.746 --> 12:29.746
You know that's a grown man in disguise,
don't you?

12:29.790 --> 12:33.002
- Yes.
- No. No-wuh.

12:33.085 --> 12:35.504
See, kid talk? No-wuh.

12:35.588 --> 12:38.716
Oh, our mistake. In that case,
you'll probably wanna audition

12:38.799 --> 12:41.594
for that Freezilee Slush Bucket commercial
like all the other kids.

12:42.720 --> 12:45.764
Yes. Yes, I do.

12:45.848 --> 12:50.519
Ooh! Freezilee Slush Bucket!
Giggle-giggle.

12:50.728 --> 12:53.230
Freezilee makes it more gooder!

12:59.278 --> 13:02.364
Sophie One, you're doing a great job.

13:02.531 --> 13:05.159
Other Sophie,
you're brushing like an animal.

13:05.284 --> 13:07.161
Sophie One, spray me.

13:13.167 --> 13:14.793
My hair has a flat.

13:15.503 --> 13:18.464
Diddly's Devious Deflater.
I usually use it on tires.

13:27.139 --> 13:30.100
Diddly's Dirty Decaf.
It's actually just dirt.

13:30.184 --> 13:32.436
Hmm?

13:35.689 --> 13:39.735
"Employees must wash hands."
Yeah, like that ever happens.

13:39.818 --> 13:41.278
We should probably change that.

13:41.904 --> 13:44.698
"Wash tushy here." Much better.

13:44.782 --> 13:46.450
And now for the grand finale...

13:46.534 --> 13:49.870
Just a few of these
Diddly's Dinorhea Drops, and it's...

13:52.915 --> 13:54.041
Huh? What does that mean?

13:54.166 --> 13:57.711
Everyone gets diarrhea.
And I locked all the bathroom doors!

13:57.795 --> 14:02.216
Uh, no way, Diddly.
Locked bathroom doors? Too much.

14:02.299 --> 14:03.299
You crossed the line.

14:03.425 --> 14:04.843
Crossed the line!

14:04.927 --> 14:07.346
What?
I've based my whole life on your book.

14:07.429 --> 14:10.391
I'm following your lead.
Hey, you made me this way!

14:10.474 --> 14:14.270
Plus, we had a deal.
No pranks, no extra credit.

14:14.436 --> 14:16.355
- Then the deal's off.
- Yeah, we're out.

14:16.564 --> 14:21.485
Man. Never meet your idols.
It's always a disappointment.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.283
Great, there goes our extra credit.

14:27.366 --> 14:29.493
Unless we go to Piqua Glacier
and find another dino.

14:29.577 --> 14:30.577
Yes!

14:30.828 --> 14:34.039
- My... My dinosaur's gone!
- Are you sure?

14:34.123 --> 14:38.168
Well, I'll need to run some tests...
Yes, I'm sure! How are you me?

14:38.252 --> 14:40.004
Melvin! Other Melvin!

14:40.087 --> 14:43.108
Why are you dressed like the embodiment
of 19th century privilege and wealth?

14:43.132 --> 14:46.594
I'm posing as a child
to get intel on George and Harold.

14:46.802 --> 14:49.430
Ugh, I hate costumes.
They're like lies that you wear.

14:49.513 --> 14:51.390
What is it, you beknickered aristocrat?

14:51.473 --> 14:54.143
We're in crisis mode.
Someone stole Melvin's dinosaur.

14:54.226 --> 14:57.313
I wonder if that has anything to do
with the dinosaur

14:57.396 --> 15:00.149
George and Harold are walking around with?

15:00.232 --> 15:01.859
Huh? Huh?

15:01.984 --> 15:05.279
- What?
- Do I get my new parking spot now?

15:05.362 --> 15:06.864
Get out!

15:06.947 --> 15:08.407
I need another dinosaur!

15:10.242 --> 15:12.453
Dinosaurs! We found them!

15:14.663 --> 15:16.123
That was way too easy.

15:16.206 --> 15:18.626
Yeah, I can't believe
somebody else didn't find these.

15:18.709 --> 15:21.253
Someone else did find them.

15:22.046 --> 15:22.922
Melvin?

15:23.005 --> 15:27.343
Here to steal another dino from me?
Well, think again, kidiots.

15:27.426 --> 15:29.746
- That's a combination of kid and idiot.
- Yeah, we get it.

15:29.803 --> 15:34.058
Good. Now marvel at my new invention,
the Thaw and Order 2000.

15:36.518 --> 15:37.937
Pretty sure that's a hair dryer.

15:38.020 --> 15:40.648
Yes, but I added two more settings!

15:41.023 --> 15:43.692
And when this ice melts,
I'll have three dinosaurs,

15:43.776 --> 15:45.778
which is three times more than you have!

15:45.861 --> 15:48.030
Sorry, did you say,
"three times more dinosaurs"?

15:48.113 --> 15:50.074
Because I ran the numbers
and they do not add up.

15:50.407 --> 15:53.661
Sorry, I can't hear your brain atrophy
over my Thaw and Order 2000.

15:53.744 --> 15:57.998
- There goes our extra credit. Again.
- Yeah. And summer camp.

15:58.082 --> 16:01.502
<i>Just in case you forgot
what this whole crazy caper is all about.</i>

16:01.585 --> 16:05.923
Ha! And you said dinosaurs were
ferocious killing machines. Fools!

16:17.351 --> 16:21.647
- Think they're smart like Diddly?
- Hope so. If not, we had a good run.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.274
Did you say, "Diddly"?

16:25.484 --> 16:28.070
Close one. Yeah, you know him?

16:28.195 --> 16:30.030
Sure do. Diddly's an old friend.

16:30.114 --> 16:33.409
Name's Malison, by the way.
Last name, Saurus.

16:33.492 --> 16:36.370
These are the Saurus brothers.
No relation. So, you know where he is?

16:36.453 --> 16:40.457
I wish! We needed a live dinosaur
to get extra credit, but he split.

16:40.624 --> 16:43.377
Tell you what, you help us find him,
and we'll take care of you.

16:43.460 --> 16:45.838
Okay. But he could be anywhere.

16:45.963 --> 16:48.048
Say, is there a pizza joint around here?

16:48.132 --> 16:50.634
<i>Chapter 4, Di-no Win Situation.</i>

16:51.010 --> 16:52.094
Mm! Pepperoni!

16:52.928 --> 16:55.848
Hello, Diddly. Enjoying your slice?

16:55.973 --> 16:57.558
Malison! What are you doing here?

16:57.766 --> 17:00.853
What I should've done a long time ago.
Kicking your dino butt!

17:00.936 --> 17:02.771
Wait. I thought you were friends?

17:02.855 --> 17:05.773
Best friends. Until he put our pizza joint
out of business.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.777
He put his Diddly Drops in the sauce
and gave everyone dino-rhea!

17:08.944 --> 17:14.074
More like pizza-rhea. Get it?
It's a combination of pizza and diarrhea!

17:15.075 --> 17:17.618
We get it! And now I'm gonna get you!

17:20.204 --> 17:24.084
Yes! Diddly's Drowsy Dumpster.
Works every time!

17:25.877 --> 17:28.213
No one hits us with a dumpster
and gets away with it.

17:28.297 --> 17:31.508
That's dino-disrespectful!
After him, boys!

17:31.592 --> 17:34.970
- Man, they're gonna kill Diddly.
- Well, it is kinda his fault.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.806
Actually, it's kinda our fault.
We wrote that comic.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.141
We gotta help Diddly.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.156
Look! Mr. Krupp!

17:42.895 --> 17:45.689
Oh, hello, age-appropriate chums.

17:45.773 --> 17:49.943
I'm not spying on you.
I'm just having a slice of this pizza pie.

17:56.658 --> 17:59.953
- Yeah!
- Tra-la-lunchtime!

18:02.498 --> 18:05.542
- So, where do you think they went?
- I've got one idea.

18:05.709 --> 18:06.710
What's your idea?

18:08.545 --> 18:12.216
<i>Putt-A-Saurus, Piqua's top
dinosaur-themed mini-golf course.</i>

18:12.299 --> 18:16.970
These dinos are trouble? No.
I play mini-golf with them all the time!

18:17.054 --> 18:20.849
These are fake dinosaurs.
We're looking for real dinosaurs.

18:21.016 --> 18:24.394
Wait. These aren't real? Real metal!

18:24.478 --> 18:27.564
Dinosaurs that love mini-golf
just like me!

18:27.648 --> 18:29.942
Dino-fore!

18:34.321 --> 18:35.614
So unfair!

18:35.697 --> 18:38.742
Sorry. I just love this game so much.
Dino do-over!

18:38.826 --> 18:42.204
No! We gotta find Diddly
before Malison does.

18:42.287 --> 18:43.831
Ow! Watch it, buddy!

18:44.331 --> 18:46.083
- Diddly?
- Nope! Never heard of him!

18:46.166 --> 18:47.417
Nothing.

18:49.711 --> 18:50.751
Going somewhere?

18:52.506 --> 18:55.300
- Captain Underpants, do something!
- Okay!

18:58.554 --> 19:01.390
- What are you doing?
- I'm hamboning.

19:01.473 --> 19:02.641
Do something useful.

19:02.724 --> 19:06.311
Oh. Thanks for being more specific.

19:06.395 --> 19:09.189
<i>Chapter 5,
The Incredibly Graphic Violence Chapter.</i>

19:09.273 --> 19:10.732
<i>Presented in Dine-O-Rama.</i>

<i>You're wasting food! Dino Dump!</i>

19:28.041 --> 19:31.503
You like pranks?
Well, this prank's called Diddly's Doom.

19:31.587 --> 19:32.796
You'll never see it coming.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.132
Except now you know it's coming
'cause I just told you.

19:35.382 --> 19:37.301
Diddly-ooh! Diddly-ow!

19:38.969 --> 19:40.529
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

19:40.596 --> 19:42.556
Easy, man! He's awake!

19:42.639 --> 19:46.602
I was having the best dream.
There were dinosaurs, and mini-golf...

19:46.685 --> 19:49.771
That wasn't a dream, it's real!
You gotta save Diddly!

19:50.063 --> 19:53.025
Okay! Whoever that is, here I come!

19:55.611 --> 19:58.655
Is one of you dinosaurs Diddly?

19:58.739 --> 20:01.241
- Help!
- Oh, nice to meet you.

20:01.325 --> 20:05.537
You other dinosaurs?
Meet Wedgie-Saurus Rex.

20:07.706 --> 20:10.125
One more second. Almost there.

20:10.209 --> 20:14.838
And, no, wait.
Uh-huh, just one more sec, okay!

20:14.922 --> 20:18.884
There we go. This... Nope.

20:18.967 --> 20:23.847
Yes! This baby's gonna make you wish
you were extinct again!

20:28.227 --> 20:29.770
Ooh, snow!

20:30.854 --> 20:32.272
Ick! Underpants!

20:33.523 --> 20:37.694
No more pranks.
Time to get serious. Dino-serious.

20:37.778 --> 20:40.364
Oh, no.
I wish we hadn't written that comic.

20:40.447 --> 20:44.409
Harold, yes! That's it, the comic!
How did Captain Underpants win that one?

20:44.493 --> 20:46.620
With the Freezilee
Slush Bucket Machine!

20:46.703 --> 20:48.622
Hey, Malison!
Look out behind you!

20:48.705 --> 20:51.667
Hey, why'd you snitch on...?

20:51.750 --> 20:53.293
Whoa!

20:53.627 --> 20:55.087
Sometimes we are so good.

20:56.296 --> 20:59.049
- Cap! Pull the lever!
- This is no time for dessert!

21:00.050 --> 21:01.635
I got it.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.438
Hmm?

21:13.522 --> 21:14.940
It's the cops! Run!

21:21.238 --> 21:24.908
- Great. We've saved the day...
- But lost the extra credit.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.910
- You again.
- Hello, officer.

21:26.994 --> 21:30.497
I'd...
like to file a missing pants report.

21:30.914 --> 21:33.041
<i>Chapter 6, Live and Let Dino.</i>

21:33.125 --> 21:37.462
Since no one bothered to turn in
a project, no one gets extra credit.

21:37.546 --> 21:40.507
Which means I'm still on top,
you sea of mediocrity.

21:40.590 --> 21:43.719
Melvin's number one! Melvin's number one!

21:46.054 --> 21:47.764
Melvin's number one!

21:47.848 --> 21:51.601
We were this close to summer camp
until Diddly dino-ditched us.

21:53.687 --> 21:55.287
Delivery for George and Harold.

21:55.480 --> 21:59.026
Extra cheese and extra credit.

21:59.151 --> 22:03.030
- Diddly! You dino-delivered!
- Yeah, plus I opened a new pizza place,

22:03.113 --> 22:06.825
Diddly's Deep Dish,
so free pizza for everyone!

22:06.908 --> 22:08.994
Told you dinosaurs ate pizza.

22:09.077 --> 22:12.456
Plus, I mean, dinosaur!
So do we get the extra credit now?

22:12.789 --> 22:15.542
- Fine.
- How about a slice?

22:20.756 --> 22:23.842
- Oh! Oh, excuse me!
- Diddly Drops?

22:28.263 --> 22:31.475
Once again, George and Harold
have ham-fisted their way to victory.

22:31.558 --> 22:33.518
And there's only one person to blame.

22:33.852 --> 22:36.229
At least this spot has plenty of room.
