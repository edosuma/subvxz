00:04.697 --> 00:06.864
I need makeup over here, please.

00:08.267 --> 00:10.000
I know, we're on time.

00:10.002 --> 00:11.769
Come on, guys. Let's go.

00:25.017 --> 00:26.931
Hey, want to finish her up?

00:45.320 --> 00:47.053
Bull.

00:47.055 --> 00:48.188
Bull?

00:48.190 --> 00:49.790
Hello?

00:51.126 --> 00:53.026
You and your observation game.

00:53.028 --> 00:55.095
All right. What do you see?

00:55.097 --> 00:58.565
This hair guy hates his model.

00:58.567 --> 01:00.333
She's a handful.

01:00.335 --> 01:02.803
And in the back there,
they're having an affair.

01:02.805 --> 01:05.539
And your former boss
is one tough cookie.

01:05.541 --> 01:08.132
Will, will you please keep up?

01:09.077 --> 01:10.577
Nella's still a hard-ass.

01:10.579 --> 01:14.281
That's Ms. Hard-Ass to you, Mr. Chunk.

01:14.283 --> 01:16.616
Nella. You know my boss, Dr. Jason Bull.

01:16.618 --> 01:19.786
You've only had one real boss,
and that was me.

01:19.788 --> 01:21.354
Yes, ma'am.

01:21.356 --> 01:23.824
Oh, and, uh, that's Will.

01:23.826 --> 01:24.891
He's the new me.

01:24.893 --> 01:26.259
Hi.

01:26.261 --> 01:27.894
And I love your futuristic theme.

01:29.264 --> 01:30.463
When do I get my iScarf?

01:30.465 --> 01:32.246
When Will invents it.

01:32.768 --> 01:34.801
Him and his fancy science degree.

01:34.803 --> 01:36.503
God, he's such a disappointment.

01:36.505 --> 01:38.238
Will?

01:40.475 --> 01:43.410
If that reporter gets close
to the finale gown,

01:43.412 --> 01:44.411
you're fired.

01:44.413 --> 01:46.112
Okay. Got it.

01:46.114 --> 01:47.614
Will.

01:47.616 --> 01:49.182
Nella's still anal about...

01:49.184 --> 01:51.084
- Design theft, I know.
- Okay.

01:51.086 --> 01:52.452
Thank you.

01:54.890 --> 01:57.157
Hi there. I'm Jason.

01:57.159 --> 01:58.692
Hi. I'm Allie.

01:58.694 --> 01:59.793
Allie.

01:59.795 --> 02:01.528
I know I look like a stoplight.

02:01.530 --> 02:05.031
Well, you could definitely cause
a traffic jam or two.

02:05.033 --> 02:07.601
Have a good show, Ms. Stoplight.

02:07.603 --> 02:09.269
Welcome to Fashion Week.

02:11.773 --> 02:13.874
We met in this exact spot

02:13.876 --> 02:15.041
three years ago.

02:15.043 --> 02:16.710
You wouldn't let me date whatshername.

02:16.712 --> 02:18.044
I wouldn't let you?

02:18.046 --> 02:19.145
Jason, he saved you.

02:19.147 --> 02:20.413
I saw that girl,

02:20.415 --> 02:21.982
and you dodged a missile.

02:21.984 --> 02:23.953
Chunk, it looks like you finally did

02:23.955 --> 02:25.597
something right in the fashion world.

02:25.599 --> 02:27.310
You know what? Don't come for me today.

02:27.312 --> 02:28.488
Okay? I'm here for the show.

02:28.490 --> 02:30.323
Chunk. It's okay.

02:31.927 --> 02:33.793
You look gorgeous, J.

02:39.968 --> 02:41.735
That's Kira Petrova,

02:41.737 --> 02:43.943
new face of Nella Wester's
print campaign.

02:44.003 --> 02:45.405
Look at that silhouette.

03:07.863 --> 03:10.330
Not everybody can pull off
white gold, but she does it.

03:10.332 --> 03:14.234
Ah. Speaking of white gold. Diana.

03:14.236 --> 03:15.735
Texas Diana? Yes.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.370
Oh. Oh, my.

03:17.372 --> 03:19.673
It's dirty, isn't it?

03:19.675 --> 03:22.876
She knows where I am, she's
just trying to distract me.

03:22.878 --> 03:25.211
I knew I liked her.

03:27.082 --> 03:29.716
It's Nella, not Kira.

03:29.718 --> 03:32.185
And she wasn't
even supposed to model today.

03:42.864 --> 03:44.931
Brava! Brava!

03:47.369 --> 03:49.302
Once a model, always a model.

03:50.672 --> 03:52.105
She's still got it.

03:57.012 --> 03:59.813
Nella! Nella! Oh, my God!

03:59.815 --> 04:01.715
Is there a doctor in the house?

04:01.717 --> 04:02.882
I need some help.

04:02.884 --> 04:04.551
We're at the Armory. My friend,

04:04.553 --> 04:06.252
she's collapsed. She's not breathing.

04:06.254 --> 04:08.455
I can't get a pulse.

04:08.457 --> 04:10.824
And we need some help, you got to hurry.

04:10.826 --> 04:12.325
Would you stop taking pictures?

04:12.327 --> 04:14.694
<i>The fashion world is in mourning</i>

04:14.696 --> 04:18.064
<i>after the sudden death of
renowned designer Nella Wester.</i>

04:18.065 --> 04:19.298
<i>Rumors have surged lately</i>

04:19.301 --> 04:21.735
<i>that she had an undisclosed
heart condition.</i>

04:21.737 --> 04:24.838
Sources close to Wester say
she's a recovering drug addict

04:24.840 --> 04:27.173
but had been clean for years.

04:27.175 --> 04:29.743
As fashion luminaries gather
at a service later today,

04:29.745 --> 04:31.978
the medical examiner's office
works hard to determine

04:31.980 --> 04:34.180
<i>the cause of Nella Wester's death.</i>

04:34.182 --> 04:36.182
I just know it was a brain aneurism.

04:36.184 --> 04:37.384
My aunt had one.

04:37.386 --> 04:39.419
Dropped dead in the middle
of Thanksgiving dinner.

04:39.421 --> 04:41.121
Jessica, it was a seizure.

04:41.123 --> 04:42.922
I saw her face when she died.

04:42.924 --> 04:44.557
It was a mask.

04:44.559 --> 04:46.626
Easy.

04:46.628 --> 04:49.262
People are hardwired to gossip.
It releases endorphins.

04:49.264 --> 04:51.731
Fine, fine.

04:51.733 --> 04:53.967
I'll say it: Nella O.D.'ed.

04:53.969 --> 04:56.202
She didn't sew, but
she loved her needles.

04:56.204 --> 04:58.695
Chunk, I know it hurts.

04:58.697 --> 05:00.940
Brent. She's been clean
for ten years, shut up.

05:00.942 --> 05:02.776
Jean-Carlo, you're so sensitive.

05:02.778 --> 05:03.977
Who's Prince Charming?

05:03.979 --> 05:05.311
He's Brent Orlov.

05:05.313 --> 05:07.047
Nella's biggest competitor,

05:07.049 --> 05:08.548
and a vile, vindictive douche.

05:10.218 --> 05:12.252
Hi, Chunky.

05:12.801 --> 05:14.120
You afraid he's right?

05:14.122 --> 05:15.588
That she fell off the wagon?

05:15.590 --> 05:17.223
No.

05:18.002 --> 05:19.125
Well...

05:19.127 --> 05:20.593
This is crazy.

05:20.595 --> 05:21.928
There's one way to find out.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.732
Hey, Dr. Bull.

05:25.734 --> 05:27.033
Tough day.

05:27.595 --> 05:30.770
Yeah. Uh, this is Kira,

05:30.772 --> 05:32.005
my fiancÃ©e.

05:32.007 --> 05:33.573
Oh, congratulations.

05:33.575 --> 05:35.141
Thank you.

05:35.143 --> 05:37.010
I am a lucky one.

05:37.012 --> 05:39.179
Will, I have one question for you.

05:39.727 --> 05:41.281
Was Nella using heroin?

05:41.283 --> 05:42.682
- Bull.
- Excuse me.

05:42.684 --> 05:44.084
What? Excuse me.

05:44.086 --> 05:45.852
If it isn't Neil Pike.

05:45.854 --> 05:47.620
Ah, Jason Bull.

05:47.622 --> 05:50.323
Did you know Nella Wester died
of arsenic poisoning?

05:50.325 --> 05:52.092
What?

05:52.094 --> 05:54.127
Oh, my God.

05:54.129 --> 05:55.628
Are you sure?

05:55.630 --> 05:57.297
Yeah. It was no accident.

05:57.299 --> 05:59.566
Her dress was infused
with trivalent arsenic,

05:59.568 --> 06:01.501
which absorbs through the skin.

06:01.503 --> 06:02.936
She was dead the minute
she put on that dress,

06:02.938 --> 06:04.904
she just didn't know it yet.

06:04.906 --> 06:06.139
Oh, my God.

06:06.141 --> 06:07.407
William Mercado,

06:07.409 --> 06:10.009
you are under arrest for her murder.

06:10.011 --> 06:11.778
What? You, you can't be serious.

06:11.780 --> 06:13.213
Kira, let him go. This is a mistake.

06:13.215 --> 06:14.948
- Let him go.
- Wait. No.

06:14.950 --> 06:16.850
- You can't be serious.
- Go, Chunk.

06:16.852 --> 06:17.984
What... What did you do?

06:17.986 --> 06:19.919
Nothing. I swear.

06:19.921 --> 06:22.122
What's your favorite game, Will,
checkers or chess?

06:22.124 --> 06:23.890
Don't think about it, just answer.

06:23.892 --> 06:25.892
Uh, neither. I like <i> Pictionary.</i>

06:27.196 --> 06:29.508
<i>Will Mercado wanted
to watch Ms. Wester die.</i>

06:29.510 --> 06:31.531
It wasn't enough to kill,
he had to humiliate.

06:31.533 --> 06:33.806
It's sickening. Numerous employees...

06:33.808 --> 06:35.335
What are we doing?

06:35.337 --> 06:37.176
Due diligence.

06:37.178 --> 06:38.416
...and heard Mercado

06:38.418 --> 06:40.173
threaten to kill her. He simply snapped.

06:42.177 --> 06:44.711
And he's got a PhD in chemistry.

06:44.713 --> 06:45.979
Are you done now?

06:46.224 --> 06:47.690
Pike's a renegade.

06:47.692 --> 06:52.094
Forces early arrests so he can
pressure people to plead out.

06:52.096 --> 06:54.997
He's a bully with the NYPD as muscle.

06:56.868 --> 06:58.033
No.

06:58.035 --> 06:59.101
What?

06:59.103 --> 07:01.137
You want to defend the man

07:01.139 --> 07:02.571
that killed my friend?

07:02.573 --> 07:03.906
What if Will didn't do it?

07:03.908 --> 07:05.307
And you get this how?

07:05.309 --> 07:07.410
He's not a chess player.

07:12.183 --> 07:14.850
Think about the spectacle of the crime.

07:14.852 --> 07:17.820
Nella dying right as
she hits the runway.

07:17.822 --> 07:18.821
The right amount of poison.

07:18.823 --> 07:19.955
The right amount of time.

07:19.957 --> 07:21.457
It takes planning.
Thinking six moves ahead.

07:21.459 --> 07:22.387
This...

07:22.389 --> 07:24.827
wasn't chess, Bull.

07:26.397 --> 07:29.024
She was my mentor.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.536
I know, Chunk.

07:35.006 --> 07:36.786
Mr. Pike, they wouldn't
let me go with him.

07:36.788 --> 07:38.785
It's not a field trip, miss.

07:38.806 --> 07:39.905
He's a criminal suspect.

07:39.907 --> 07:41.840
Will couldn't have done this.

07:42.581 --> 07:45.811
Can you at least tell me
where they took him?

07:45.813 --> 07:48.447
Look, I can't help you.

07:48.449 --> 07:49.982
Please. Please.

07:49.984 --> 07:52.706
If facts reveal
Will may not have done it...

07:53.187 --> 07:55.487
are you willing to just sit by?

07:57.892 --> 07:59.758
Let's at least look into it.

08:05.122 --> 08:06.554
Okay.

08:07.201 --> 08:08.410
Bull.

08:10.322 --> 08:12.371
You better be right.

08:14.298 --> 08:22.805
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

08:27.718 --> 08:29.885
So, Nella had 25 full-time employees,

08:29.887 --> 08:32.520
dozens of contractors,
several million in loans

08:32.523 --> 08:34.956
and a handful of volatile investors.

08:34.957 --> 08:36.457
And she was abusive.

08:36.460 --> 08:38.592
Lots of people
could have wanted her dead.

08:38.595 --> 08:40.227
Speaking of which.

08:40.230 --> 08:41.530
Temp forgot to charge my phone.

08:41.532 --> 08:43.498
Again? When are you going
to replace your assistant?

08:43.500 --> 08:45.000
When I find someone I like.

08:45.002 --> 08:46.101
Bull, it's been a month.

08:46.103 --> 08:47.235
The temps ain't cutting it.

08:47.237 --> 08:49.338
I knew I should have brought Chunk.

08:49.340 --> 08:50.439
What? Why?

08:50.441 --> 08:52.007
So he could give you
side-eye the whole time

08:52.009 --> 08:53.775
for taking the case? Be glad I'm here.

08:53.777 --> 08:57.746
Does someone need me to tell her
that she is loved and needed?

08:59.116 --> 09:00.615
There's the side-eye.

09:00.617 --> 09:02.417
After you.

09:02.419 --> 09:04.853
Will Mercado totally killed her.

09:04.855 --> 09:06.952
You sound convinced, Delilah.

09:06.954 --> 09:09.191
You would be, too,

09:09.193 --> 09:11.460
if you got an e-mail
saying he was going to kill her.

09:11.462 --> 09:13.236
I gave it to the police, of course.

09:13.238 --> 09:14.663
Of course.

09:14.665 --> 09:16.378
Do you know
if the police will be returning

09:16.380 --> 09:18.266
the wedding dress back to us?

09:18.268 --> 09:19.935
Ugh, that dress.

09:19.937 --> 09:22.671
It took a dozen people 3,000 hours

09:22.673 --> 09:24.773
to create that wedding gown.
Now all of it's headed

09:24.775 --> 09:26.608
to some toxic waste dump,

09:26.610 --> 09:27.976
just like this place.

09:27.978 --> 09:30.445
- Poor Nella.
- Giancarlo.

09:30.447 --> 09:32.367
Changing wardrobe?

09:32.369 --> 09:35.083
Well, I designed this
for Nella's menswear collection.

09:35.085 --> 09:36.885
Brent Orlov is throwing

09:36.887 --> 09:39.821
some ritzy black-tie-only
tomorrow night,

09:39.823 --> 09:41.323
and this will come in handy.

09:41.325 --> 09:44.292
You regularly hang out
with Nella's biggest rival?

09:44.294 --> 09:46.328
I'm looking for a job, okay?

09:46.330 --> 09:48.530
This place is done.

09:48.532 --> 09:50.198
And so are we.

09:50.200 --> 09:51.466
<i>Will.</i>

09:51.468 --> 09:52.634
You made bail.

09:52.636 --> 09:55.070
I am that good, yes.

09:55.072 --> 09:56.671
Kira.

09:56.673 --> 09:57.873
Oh.

09:59.168 --> 10:01.235
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

10:01.378 --> 10:04.246
I'm so sorry. Thank you for coming.

10:05.174 --> 10:06.882
Where else would I be?

10:06.884 --> 10:08.917
They look happy.

10:08.919 --> 10:10.285
Come with us.

10:10.287 --> 10:11.553
- Here's your bag.
- Thank you.

10:11.555 --> 10:12.779
Yeah.

10:14.028 --> 10:16.089
You know why Bull took the case?

10:16.326 --> 10:17.464
You.

10:18.687 --> 10:19.928
Right.

10:19.930 --> 10:22.032
He's knows how much Nella meant to you.

10:22.433 --> 10:25.133
Wants to make sure the right
person goes down for the crime.

10:25.928 --> 10:27.669
Take it from me:

10:27.671 --> 10:29.438
you do, too.

10:43.921 --> 10:45.821
Hi, baby.

10:45.823 --> 10:49.291
Diana! How's Texas?

10:49.293 --> 10:50.459
Big.

10:50.461 --> 10:52.227
How are those models at Fashion Week?

10:52.229 --> 10:53.395
Tall.

10:53.397 --> 10:55.063
Yeah, just you and Chuck.

10:55.065 --> 10:58.099
Tearing it up like Butch and
Sundance, pre-Bolivia.

10:58.954 --> 11:00.602
Yeah, that's us.

11:00.604 --> 11:03.371
Well, careful there, Sundance.

11:03.373 --> 11:05.807
You don't want that
fall fashion to kill you.

11:10.180 --> 11:11.379
Hello?

11:14.151 --> 11:16.718
Is it too soon to ask
what you're wearing?

11:17.654 --> 11:20.355
You know, I do like you.
You are so easy.

11:20.868 --> 11:22.624
Only with you.

11:22.626 --> 11:24.626
Yeah, I got myself a pair of your pants

11:24.628 --> 11:26.928
lying around here somewhere to prove it.

11:27.447 --> 11:29.498
You're not wearing them?

11:29.500 --> 11:31.833
Baby, I'm not wearing a thing.

11:32.380 --> 11:34.102
Bad news.

11:34.104 --> 11:36.705
The prosecution found
arsenic in Will's hands.

11:36.707 --> 11:38.773
I handled the wedding dress at the show.

11:38.775 --> 11:41.443
Marissa, we need a doctor
in a white coat to say that.

11:41.445 --> 11:43.211
Expert witness, got it.

11:43.213 --> 11:45.146
Also, Pike's got Will's e-mail

11:45.148 --> 11:47.482
threatening Nella.

11:47.484 --> 11:49.117
"I'm gonna kill Nella, I swear to God.

11:49.119 --> 11:51.319
"She's a..." bad word,

11:51.321 --> 11:53.421
"who deserves to die screaming."

11:53.423 --> 11:55.090
Let's not let Chunk see that.

11:55.092 --> 11:56.291
I didn't mean it literally.

11:56.293 --> 11:58.460
I said the same thing
about Giancarlo two days ago.

11:58.462 --> 12:00.161
Not helping, Will.

12:00.163 --> 12:02.898
What does the prosecution's
evidence all have in common?

12:02.900 --> 12:04.687
It's all circumstantial.

12:04.712 --> 12:07.502
It requires the jury to
look at a bunch of dots

12:07.504 --> 12:09.504
and perceive a pattern
that says "guilty."

12:09.506 --> 12:10.772
We need to sell the idea

12:10.774 --> 12:12.941
that A.D.A. Pike is weaving a tale.

12:12.943 --> 12:14.409
He is creating something out of nothing,

12:14.411 --> 12:16.278
and we need to find jurors
who don't like that.

12:16.280 --> 12:19.147
So we need practical people.

12:19.149 --> 12:20.882
That's right. No Picassos.

12:20.884 --> 12:23.585
No storytellers, artists
or abstract thinkers.

12:23.587 --> 12:25.188
Left-brain only.

12:27.090 --> 12:28.690
<i>Mrs. Jefferson,</i>

12:28.692 --> 12:29.691
do you like dogs?

12:29.693 --> 12:31.993
I own three pit bulls. Why?

12:31.995 --> 12:34.229
Dogs? Really, Bull?

12:34.231 --> 12:36.264
Sometimes I think
you make this stuff up.

12:36.266 --> 12:38.532
It's called random correlation.

12:39.002 --> 12:42.537
Practical people tend to like
classical music and dogs.

12:42.539 --> 12:45.407
Ergo, we like Wanda Jefferson.

12:45.409 --> 12:47.642
Juror number four, on the other hand,

12:47.644 --> 12:48.777
the doodler?

12:48.779 --> 12:51.079
Way too creative.

12:53.650 --> 12:55.650
We thank and excuse Juror Number Four.

12:57.688 --> 12:59.554
What other random correlations
have you found

12:59.556 --> 13:01.222
to identify practical people?

13:01.224 --> 13:02.811
Do you keep a journal?

13:03.560 --> 13:05.060
- No.
- Hmm-mm.

13:07.331 --> 13:09.097
Do you wear a watch?

13:09.099 --> 13:13.335
Now, if you were a dinosaur,
what kind would you be?

13:16.073 --> 13:17.372
We have a jury.

13:17.374 --> 13:18.963
The People are ready, Your Honor.

13:19.643 --> 13:21.242
Ladies and gentlemen.

13:21.244 --> 13:23.778
This is a case of premeditated
and cold-blooded murder.

13:23.780 --> 13:25.046
Not a bad haul.

13:25.048 --> 13:27.649
We have six very practical jurors,

13:27.651 --> 13:29.851
and two others leaning that way.

13:29.853 --> 13:31.586
Four creatives.

13:32.540 --> 13:35.500
Now it's time for us to get creative.

13:39.636 --> 13:40.842
Crullers from Sadie's.

13:40.899 --> 13:42.798
Look at that.

13:43.266 --> 13:45.463
My favorite Sadie's? In the Bronx?

13:45.517 --> 13:47.050
45 minutes away?

13:47.052 --> 13:49.119
I was in the neighborhood.

13:49.121 --> 13:51.955
Trying to make me feel better?

13:51.957 --> 13:54.524
Why? Would that work?

13:54.526 --> 13:56.520
Marissa, anything yet?

13:56.522 --> 13:58.362
Yeah. Mirror jury results came in.

13:58.364 --> 13:59.930
Oliveira, Jefferson

13:59.932 --> 14:02.432
and Whistler responded to
Benny's opening statement.

14:02.434 --> 14:05.702
But not Andrew Wong... Odd.

14:05.704 --> 14:07.337
Well, Wong's a financial planner.

14:07.339 --> 14:08.372
I mean, maybe he's more creative

14:08.374 --> 14:10.207
than we gave him credit for.

14:10.209 --> 14:11.875
No. It's his clothes.

14:11.877 --> 14:14.044
Monday, black pants, black shirt.

14:14.046 --> 14:16.546
Tuesday, black pants, green shirt.

14:16.548 --> 14:19.516
Wednesday... you get the idea.

14:19.518 --> 14:21.017
He likes his black pants.

14:21.019 --> 14:22.519
But not fashion.

14:22.521 --> 14:26.688
He is threatened
by Will's cool-kid vibe.

14:27.993 --> 14:29.593
Everyone expresses their fashion,

14:29.595 --> 14:31.228
whether they're aware of it or not.

14:31.230 --> 14:33.063
It's how we interact
with the environment.

14:33.065 --> 14:34.668
Right.

14:34.670 --> 14:36.166
Ah, Cable.

14:36.168 --> 14:38.769
You're trying to say you're
counter-cultural and unique.

14:38.771 --> 14:41.004
But the hipster effect...

14:41.006 --> 14:43.039
and it is a real thing...

14:43.041 --> 14:46.042
says that you really just
look like every other hipster.

14:46.044 --> 14:47.644
Not so unique.

14:47.646 --> 14:49.079
Case in point.

14:50.215 --> 14:51.982
And Marissa.

14:51.984 --> 14:53.316
You love to dress up.

14:53.318 --> 14:54.576
And I would say

14:54.578 --> 14:56.853
that your high heels
flatter your lovely figure,

14:56.855 --> 14:59.330
were I not your boss, so...

14:59.332 --> 15:02.459
Were I not your employee,
I would say thank you.

15:02.461 --> 15:05.328
Chunk, what is Bull's
psychological fashion profile?

15:06.087 --> 15:07.264
Cardigans.

15:07.799 --> 15:09.366
Professional but not overt.

15:09.774 --> 15:12.369
He hides behind the suit... Dark colors.

15:12.371 --> 15:14.171
Same look every day.

15:14.173 --> 15:15.605
Stylish.

15:15.607 --> 15:18.335
Gives him the ability
to watch or be watched.

15:18.360 --> 15:19.576
A man for all seasons.

15:19.578 --> 15:22.473
Well, I know you two put
a lot of thought into appearance,

15:22.475 --> 15:24.548
so, clearly, you're gonna have
no problem

15:24.550 --> 15:26.583
figuring out a look for Will

15:26.585 --> 15:28.985
that stops scaring Mr. Wong.

15:28.987 --> 15:30.287
Right, Chunk?

15:30.289 --> 15:31.521
Yeah.

15:31.523 --> 15:32.689
On it.

15:33.381 --> 15:35.625
So the prosecution just dropped

15:35.627 --> 15:38.728
a revised witness list... two new names.

15:38.730 --> 15:43.400
Giancarlo Sartor and Brent Orlov.

15:43.402 --> 15:45.936
Nella Wester's number two guy
and her competitor.

15:45.938 --> 15:47.737
They must have damaging testimony.

15:47.739 --> 15:50.207
We need to talk to them
and find out what it is.

15:50.209 --> 15:54.044
I happen to know where they'll
both be tonight, in a tux.

15:54.046 --> 15:56.613
Marissa, slip on your
favorite high heels.

15:56.615 --> 15:58.181
We're going to a party.

15:58.183 --> 16:00.584
Brent Orlov is my favorite designer.

16:00.586 --> 16:02.219
Stop having fun, Marissa.

16:02.221 --> 16:04.154
We're here to work.

16:07.292 --> 16:10.527
It's time to get down to business.

16:23.365 --> 16:25.933
All right, we're here

16:25.935 --> 16:27.301
to cross-examine witnesses.

16:27.303 --> 16:28.468
Think of it as

16:28.470 --> 16:29.703
a sexier <i> People's Court.</i>

16:29.705 --> 16:31.972
People in $20,000 dresses.

16:31.974 --> 16:33.440
Cable, you didn't see that.

16:33.442 --> 16:36.310
I totally saw that, but I won't tell.

16:36.312 --> 16:38.111
- Hi.
- Gemma.

16:38.113 --> 16:39.913
So this is Marissa Morgan, she...

16:39.915 --> 16:41.748
Do you mind zipping me?
I'm alone tonight.

16:41.750 --> 16:44.851
I couldn't quite reach.

16:44.853 --> 16:46.353
Why do I not believe that?

16:46.355 --> 16:47.988
Oh, shut up.

16:47.990 --> 16:49.556
Was that shade?

16:49.558 --> 16:51.525
I think that was shade.

16:51.527 --> 16:52.993
I'm weirdly flattered.

16:52.995 --> 16:55.796
And there's Orlov.

16:56.799 --> 16:58.665
Fire engine red,

16:58.667 --> 17:01.501
and that married couple he's talking to.

17:01.503 --> 17:03.770
The wife is having an affair with Orlov.

17:03.772 --> 17:05.204
Really?

17:05.207 --> 17:07.874
And so is her husband.

17:07.876 --> 17:09.242
I will make sure

17:09.244 --> 17:12.445
not to bring that up,
and you go find Giancarlo.

17:12.448 --> 17:13.914
Mmm.

17:13.915 --> 17:15.781
Two-drink maximum.

17:19.320 --> 17:20.520
Ah.

17:29.732 --> 17:31.498
Kira.

17:31.500 --> 17:33.700
Hey. Didn't expect to find you here.

17:34.588 --> 17:36.003
I really like those shoes.

17:36.005 --> 17:37.271
Thank you.

17:37.273 --> 17:38.672
They're amazingly comfortable.

17:38.674 --> 17:41.041
Ah. Lucky you.

17:41.043 --> 17:43.844
- You look gorgeous.
- Thank you.

17:49.018 --> 17:50.884
Come.

17:54.823 --> 17:56.757
Brent Orlov.

17:57.284 --> 17:59.359
I know who you are.

17:59.361 --> 18:00.794
I'm Marissa.

18:00.796 --> 18:02.396
Marissa.

18:02.398 --> 18:04.264
Can I just tell you

18:04.266 --> 18:06.166
what your fall collection meant to me?

18:06.168 --> 18:07.501
Please.

18:07.503 --> 18:08.769
The embroidery

18:08.771 --> 18:11.184
on the chiffon and tulle gowns

18:11.186 --> 18:13.910
was a master class in wearable poetry.

18:13.912 --> 18:15.942
Well, I'm so glad you like to read.

18:15.944 --> 18:18.011
You must allow me to
write something on you.

18:18.013 --> 18:20.447
I would love that.

18:20.449 --> 18:21.882
My pleasure.

18:22.880 --> 18:24.851
You know fashion on a runway.

18:24.853 --> 18:27.087
I know fashion in a courthouse.

18:27.089 --> 18:28.555
And the key to sartorial
success in court

18:28.557 --> 18:29.790
is to make the jury comfortable.

18:29.792 --> 18:32.225
Chunk, thank you for doing this.

18:32.227 --> 18:34.428
To make this jury comfortable,

18:34.430 --> 18:36.463
you will dress down.

18:36.465 --> 18:39.966
None of that hipster
fashionista happening vibe.

18:39.968 --> 18:41.435
Look, I-I want you to...

18:41.437 --> 18:43.070
These are people that value function.

18:43.072 --> 18:44.338
You dress for fashion.

18:44.340 --> 18:47.107
You wear bright colors,
they'll hate you.

18:47.109 --> 18:48.608
You wear weird, cool fabrics,

18:48.610 --> 18:50.110
- they'll hate you.
- Sure, man.

18:50.112 --> 18:52.546
- I just need to tell you...
- Those socks are both.

18:52.548 --> 18:54.277
Lose 'em.

19:00.589 --> 19:02.755
I didn't kill Nella.

19:03.225 --> 19:04.925
I swear.

19:06.795 --> 19:08.428
Wear these instead.

19:10.399 --> 19:12.199
<i>What are you gonna
say in court tomorrow?</i>

19:12.201 --> 19:13.667
Must be fascinating

19:13.669 --> 19:16.103
if the prosecution wants you
on the stand.

19:16.105 --> 19:17.494
It is.

19:18.207 --> 19:21.865
Will Mercado asked me to find him

19:21.867 --> 19:24.311
an arsenic supplier.

19:24.658 --> 19:26.713
Something about making a dye.

19:26.715 --> 19:27.814
"Die."

19:27.816 --> 19:29.216
Nella...

19:29.218 --> 19:31.918
Arsenic was used in fabric dyes
in the 19th century, who knew?

19:31.920 --> 19:34.421
It killed a lot of Victorians.

19:34.423 --> 19:36.256
I'm looking up suppliers now.

19:36.258 --> 19:39.259
You can't be too unhappy
about her death, though.

19:39.261 --> 19:43.163
I mean, you two were rivals, right?

19:45.467 --> 19:47.100
And, God, did she have an ego.

19:47.102 --> 19:50.704
Bragged that she was creating
something revolutionary.

19:50.706 --> 19:52.639
"Revolutionary."

19:52.641 --> 19:55.240
Said it would change
the face of couture.

19:55.978 --> 19:57.611
- Oh.
- I've been an awful host.

19:57.613 --> 20:01.615
Please allow me to
get you something else.

20:01.617 --> 20:03.183
What are you saying in court, Giancarlo?

20:03.185 --> 20:05.585
What am I saying in court?
Just what I saw.

20:05.587 --> 20:07.854
When I went back, Will Mercado
was spraying something

20:07.856 --> 20:10.290
on the wedding dress.
Was it arsenic? No idea.

20:10.292 --> 20:12.225
You think he killed her?

20:12.227 --> 20:13.927
Before, I would have said no.

20:13.929 --> 20:16.830
He's such a nerd, right?

20:16.832 --> 20:18.832
But, I mean, nicest guy in the world.

20:18.834 --> 20:21.868
Bull, I may have something for you.

20:23.639 --> 20:26.306
Was Nella working on anything
revolutionary?

20:26.308 --> 20:27.841
Game-changing?

20:27.843 --> 20:28.975
A new line, maybe?

20:28.977 --> 20:30.477
Game-changing? No.

20:30.479 --> 20:32.412
Oh, crap, I wonder if
that's what got stolen.

20:32.414 --> 20:33.780
Stolen?

20:33.782 --> 20:36.249
Her studio got broken into?
You didn't mention that.

20:36.251 --> 20:37.317
It was the night after Nella died.

20:37.319 --> 20:38.351
They broke into the safe.

20:38.353 --> 20:39.686
And I don't even know

20:39.688 --> 20:42.522
what they took; she was so secretive.

20:42.524 --> 20:45.725
Tupac could have been in there.
Oh, Anderson!

20:46.995 --> 20:50.730
Game-changing. Theft.

20:50.732 --> 20:52.432
Huh.

20:52.434 --> 20:55.235
Hey. Oh, look.

20:55.237 --> 20:57.571
It's Stoplight. She was
at the fashion show.

20:59.541 --> 21:01.675
Hello, Allie.

21:01.677 --> 21:03.210
Hello.

21:03.212 --> 21:04.578
How's modeling?

21:04.580 --> 21:06.012
I'm retiring.

21:06.014 --> 21:09.583
Model years are like dog years
and I just turned 29, so...

21:09.585 --> 21:12.452
Yeah. One foot in the grave.

21:12.454 --> 21:14.521
Right. Well,

21:14.523 --> 21:16.089
a smart girl like you,

21:16.091 --> 21:17.657
I'm sure you'll land on your feet.

21:17.659 --> 21:20.193
Hope so.

21:20.195 --> 21:22.562
It's too bad about
that break-in at Nella's studio.

21:22.564 --> 21:24.698
She got robbed? Of what?

21:24.700 --> 21:26.666
Nella was working on some kind of

21:26.668 --> 21:28.668
cutting edge, revolutionary thing.

21:28.670 --> 21:29.669
Oh...

21:29.671 --> 21:31.571
She did ask a few of the models

21:31.573 --> 21:33.707
at the show if they'd be
available for a campaign

21:33.709 --> 21:36.142
- in the fall.
- What kind of a campaign?

21:36.144 --> 21:38.345
I don't know. I didn't make the cut.

21:38.347 --> 21:40.413
I walk in the room and
all she wants to do

21:40.415 --> 21:41.748
is look at my feet.

21:41.750 --> 21:44.050
And I was a dancer,
so there's a whole lot of bad

21:44.052 --> 21:46.520
going on down there.

21:48.624 --> 21:50.590
Feet.

21:52.661 --> 21:54.661
Shoes.

21:54.663 --> 21:56.329
Raise your arm.

21:58.534 --> 22:01.101
So, how long were you Nella's assistant?

22:09.237 --> 22:10.805
Two years.

22:12.013 --> 22:14.147
Two long years.

22:14.149 --> 22:15.982
Some days, I wanted to kill her.

22:17.786 --> 22:20.005
But when I wanted to go to <i> Vogue,</i>

22:20.556 --> 22:22.789
she wrote the greatest
recommendation letter

22:22.791 --> 22:24.491
I've ever read.

22:25.630 --> 22:27.761
Except for when Kira said yes,

22:27.763 --> 22:30.596
the best day of my life was
when Nella hired me.

22:33.368 --> 22:35.135
Nobody else would have given me a shot.

22:36.597 --> 22:37.971
Same here.

22:42.902 --> 22:45.478
- Now, that's what I call a party.
- Kira.

22:45.480 --> 22:46.846
Nice shoes.

22:46.848 --> 22:48.782
Thank you. Will got them for me.

22:48.784 --> 22:50.584
Ah. You know where he got them?

22:50.586 --> 22:52.586
Uh... I have to go.

22:52.588 --> 22:53.954
Kira, does Will have

22:53.956 --> 22:55.956
the combination to Nella's safe?

22:56.835 --> 22:58.408
I really have to go.

22:58.410 --> 23:00.193
You know what,
this'll only take a minute.

23:00.195 --> 23:02.495
And they're very important questions.

23:03.799 --> 23:05.398
Bull, you're late.

23:05.400 --> 23:08.001
Don't worry, Pike called
a motions hearing. It'll be

23:08.003 --> 23:10.236
- about an hour.
- Benny, we have a problem.

23:10.238 --> 23:11.871
Kira wouldn't tell us everything,

23:11.873 --> 23:15.175
but I think Will stole
a pair of shoes from Nella.

23:15.177 --> 23:16.643
Shoes? Why?

23:16.645 --> 23:18.645
Believe it or not, they may be valuable.

23:18.647 --> 23:20.880
Nella's been working on something big,

23:20.882 --> 23:22.215
and these shoes may be it.

23:22.217 --> 23:23.650
Pike has this,

23:23.652 --> 23:25.535
he has a much stronger case.

23:26.655 --> 23:28.588
Bull, I got to go.

23:28.590 --> 23:29.889
<i>Judge Akintola,</i>

23:29.891 --> 23:31.291
I move that you allow into evidence

23:31.293 --> 23:33.793
a security video
from Nella Wester's studio.

23:33.795 --> 23:37.564
Your Honor, the D.A.'s office is
springing yet another surprise.

23:37.566 --> 23:40.767
We just got the video
this morning, Your Honor.

23:40.769 --> 23:43.436
It's from the night
after the victim was murdered.

23:43.438 --> 23:45.905
You know I hate surprises, Neil.

23:47.079 --> 23:48.842
Play the damn tape.

23:50.612 --> 23:53.513
That's Nella Wester's office.

23:53.515 --> 23:55.015
3:00 in the morning.

23:55.017 --> 23:56.683
That's her wall safe.

23:56.685 --> 23:58.184
And that

23:58.186 --> 24:01.287
is the defendant,
stealing from the victim.

24:01.289 --> 24:04.424
Your Honor, this video
has not been authenticated.

24:04.426 --> 24:06.359
Stealing shoes? So what?

24:06.361 --> 24:07.527
According to designs

24:07.529 --> 24:08.662
found on the victim's laptop,

24:08.664 --> 24:10.330
those shoes are a prototype.

24:10.332 --> 24:11.898
For a revolutionary new kind

24:11.900 --> 24:13.900
of stiletto heel, one that

24:13.902 --> 24:16.736
more evenly distributes
weight, so it's comfortable.

24:16.738 --> 24:19.305
The experts I've talked to say
it could be worth

24:19.307 --> 24:20.774
hundreds of millions of dollars.

24:20.776 --> 24:23.209
And that is motive

24:23.211 --> 24:24.895
for murder.

24:26.439 --> 24:28.181
A golden ticket

24:28.183 --> 24:31.618
worth hundreds of millions.

24:31.620 --> 24:34.254
The defendant killed Nella

24:34.256 --> 24:36.423
and stole the prototype shoes.

24:36.425 --> 24:37.757
Objection!

24:37.759 --> 24:40.727
These are simply the facts of the case.

24:42.264 --> 24:43.296
Marissa, by any chance,

24:43.298 --> 24:45.999
is almost the entire jury against us?

24:46.001 --> 24:49.884
Yep. They're now breaking
11 to one, guilty.

24:49.886 --> 24:51.071
<i>Well,</i>

24:51.073 --> 24:53.339
that blew our trial strategy
out of the water.

24:53.341 --> 24:56.342
The jury that was gonna save our
client's now gonna hang him.

24:57.145 --> 24:59.079
Chunk, I know this looks bad...

24:59.081 --> 25:03.149
Bad? And yet you're here,
still trying to save him.

25:03.151 --> 25:05.385
Will killed her.

25:05.387 --> 25:06.953
We don't have all the facts yet.

25:06.955 --> 25:08.321
We have enough.

25:08.323 --> 25:09.823
And here's one more.

25:09.825 --> 25:12.959
I won't be a part of this.

25:23.352 --> 25:25.394
You didn't tell us about the shoes.

25:25.955 --> 25:28.188
I knew it made me look guilty.

25:28.190 --> 25:29.756
You do now.

25:29.758 --> 25:31.692
Why did you steal the prototype?

25:31.694 --> 25:33.927
I didn't steal it. I created it.

25:33.929 --> 25:35.513
Oh,<i> you</i> did.

25:36.545 --> 25:38.665
I started with the engineering problem:

25:38.667 --> 25:41.568
what's the best way to balance
over 120 pounds of water

25:41.570 --> 25:43.804
on two tiny stilts?

25:43.806 --> 25:47.441
Plastic resin shank, polymer stiletto.

25:47.443 --> 25:49.576
I made it completely on my own.

25:49.578 --> 25:51.912
When I went to Nella with the
designs, she promised to help.

25:51.914 --> 25:53.247
Even promised me a promotion.

25:53.249 --> 25:54.715
And I fell for it.

25:54.717 --> 25:55.716
I was grateful.

25:55.718 --> 25:57.117
But something happened.

25:57.665 --> 25:58.819
After she died,

25:58.821 --> 26:00.888
I found out she was talking to a lawyer

26:00.890 --> 26:02.789
about patenting the designs herself.

26:02.791 --> 26:05.626
Nella was the thief, not me.

26:05.628 --> 26:06.768
Huh.

26:07.630 --> 26:08.795
Help me understand something.

26:08.797 --> 26:10.063
Giancarlo said he saw you

26:10.065 --> 26:12.566
spraying something
into the wedding dress.

26:12.568 --> 26:14.534
Yeah. Stiffener,

26:14.536 --> 26:16.136
like we always do at shows.

26:16.138 --> 26:18.305
Gianni knows that.

26:18.307 --> 26:20.440
What about Orlov?

26:20.442 --> 26:23.076
He told Bull that you asked him
where to buy arsenic.

26:23.078 --> 26:25.145
Sure. Arsenic's got a lot
of industrial uses.

26:25.147 --> 26:27.281
Nella asked me to look into it
for a dye.

26:27.283 --> 26:28.916
For a ribbon.

26:28.918 --> 26:30.884
But I decided the stuff's
way too dangerous.

26:30.886 --> 26:32.252
Okay.

26:32.254 --> 26:34.955
We need all the evidence that
proves the design was yours.

26:34.957 --> 26:37.024
E-mails, computer files...

26:37.026 --> 26:38.725
Nella made me destroy all of it.

26:38.727 --> 26:41.528
She said... she said we had to
protect the design from theft.

26:41.530 --> 26:43.797
<i>I want to put Will on the stand.</i>

26:43.799 --> 26:44.865
He can explain the tape.

26:44.867 --> 26:45.966
We're playing defense.

26:45.968 --> 26:47.801
We need to blow Pike out of the water.

26:47.803 --> 26:49.469
We need an alternative suspect.

26:49.471 --> 26:51.004
Wester's employees?

26:51.006 --> 26:53.106
Suppliers, investors, ex-lovers?

26:53.108 --> 26:54.408
Danny came up empty.

26:54.410 --> 26:56.109
I've got a possible.

26:56.111 --> 26:58.045
StitchBeast3000.

26:58.047 --> 27:00.247
Looks like Will is not the only one

27:00.249 --> 27:01.648
stealing Nella Wester's property.

27:01.650 --> 27:03.717
Someone by the name of StitchBeast3000

27:03.719 --> 27:06.987
is selling off the studio's
clothes on the dark net.

27:06.989 --> 27:08.488
How much?

27:08.490 --> 27:10.724
$200,000 worth, this week.

27:10.726 --> 27:12.192
Any chance you want
to get me something special?

27:12.194 --> 27:14.828
Yeah. A suspect in Will's murder.

27:14.830 --> 27:17.497
Where's Danny? We are going shopping.

27:17.499 --> 27:19.333
Well, can I come?

27:34.650 --> 27:37.417
You're StrongLikeBull99, right?
Looking to buy the red dress?

27:37.419 --> 27:39.119
Well, hi, Delilah.

27:41.323 --> 27:43.390
Stealing from your dead boss?

27:43.392 --> 27:45.025
Let's chat.

27:45.027 --> 27:47.241
You know how this looks, right?

27:47.563 --> 27:48.996
I didn't kill Nella.

27:48.998 --> 27:50.297
I wasn't even at the show.

27:50.299 --> 27:52.366
Then why are you so scared
if you're not guilty?

27:52.974 --> 27:55.535
Maybe because you know who is?

27:55.537 --> 27:58.472
No. How would I know that?

28:00.122 --> 28:01.808
Oh, Delilah,

28:01.810 --> 28:03.410
you do realize you can't shrink.

28:04.880 --> 28:06.013
Right, Danny? She can...

28:06.015 --> 28:08.682
curl her body up slightly,
pull her knees

28:08.684 --> 28:10.450
into her chest, but she's
still gonna be right there.

28:10.452 --> 28:11.385
Mm.

28:11.387 --> 28:12.486
- I can see her.
- Yeah.

28:12.488 --> 28:13.920
We can see you.

28:13.922 --> 28:15.922
So let's start at the beginning,

28:15.924 --> 28:17.924
with the truth.

28:19.928 --> 28:21.328
What's up?

28:21.330 --> 28:23.263
We got a suspect.

28:23.265 --> 28:24.631
A good one.

28:24.633 --> 28:26.500
Great, let's put 'em on the stand.

28:26.502 --> 28:28.535
It's our client's fiancÃ©e.

28:29.299 --> 28:30.303
Kira?

28:30.305 --> 28:32.139
- Mm.
- Really?

28:32.141 --> 28:35.542
Kira was scheduled
to model that wedding dress,

28:35.544 --> 28:37.244
but she bailed at the last minute.

28:37.246 --> 28:38.951
Left the building.

28:40.766 --> 28:42.582
So Nella had to step in

28:42.584 --> 28:43.771
and wear the dress.

28:44.920 --> 28:46.686
Damn, Bull.

28:46.688 --> 28:50.490
Kira swore the one person
who knew about it to secrecy.

28:50.492 --> 28:53.727
Apparently, she was, uh,
pretty scary about it, too.

28:53.729 --> 28:56.563
Sounds like reasonable doubt
for our client.

28:56.565 --> 28:58.598
We'll put Kira on the stand tomorrow.

28:58.600 --> 29:00.467
I got to talk to Will
about this. He doesn't know.

29:00.469 --> 29:02.102
No. No, no, no, no, no.

29:02.104 --> 29:04.504
Don't... don't tell him.

29:04.506 --> 29:05.705
He'll tell her.

29:05.707 --> 29:07.974
He is head over heels for her,
literally.

29:07.976 --> 29:10.644
For this to work,
I need to come after her.

29:10.646 --> 29:12.446
We're accusing the woman
he loves of murder.

29:12.448 --> 29:13.814
Well, yeah.

29:13.816 --> 29:15.687
She may have done it.

29:16.185 --> 29:18.585
You want him to flip out
in front of the jury?

29:18.587 --> 29:20.220
Are you trying to save Will's life

29:20.222 --> 29:22.456
or are you trying
to save his relationship?

29:22.458 --> 29:23.757
Both.

29:23.759 --> 29:25.792
And I'm trying to get Chunk
to stick with me.

29:25.794 --> 29:28.228
See what I'm doing? It's a trifecta.

29:29.031 --> 29:31.182
I'm gonna tell Will tomorrow.

29:33.402 --> 29:34.801
Hey, Jason.

29:34.803 --> 29:36.136
Well, look at you,

29:36.138 --> 29:37.137
still at the office.

29:37.139 --> 29:38.305
Yes,

29:38.307 --> 29:39.639
Skype.

29:39.641 --> 29:41.975
Are you checking up on me?

29:41.977 --> 29:44.044
Well, now I don't have
to ask what you're wearing.

29:44.046 --> 29:45.579
So did you finish the brief yet?

29:45.581 --> 29:47.414
Now, how'd you know
I was working on a brief?

29:47.416 --> 29:49.282
Because you always talk dirty

29:49.284 --> 29:51.618
when you get stuck on an argument.

29:51.620 --> 29:54.253
Well, right now, I'm reading the news.

29:54.255 --> 29:56.089
You didn't tell me about Nella Wester.

29:56.091 --> 29:57.390
Fashion Week

29:57.392 --> 29:59.014
was less fun this year.

30:01.590 --> 30:03.130
Why didn't you say anything?

30:03.132 --> 30:04.731
It's complicated,

30:04.733 --> 30:05.699
I guess.

30:05.701 --> 30:07.400
Okay.

30:07.402 --> 30:09.536
It's, uh, too real.

30:09.942 --> 30:11.671
Not our relationship. I get it.

30:13.075 --> 30:14.174
When's the brief due?

30:14.176 --> 30:15.809
Tomorrow. The opposing counsel's

30:15.811 --> 30:17.477
trying to muscle me into a settlement,

30:17.479 --> 30:19.779
but they're gonna learn I don't muscle.

30:19.781 --> 30:21.011
I bet they are.

30:21.013 --> 30:22.450
Hmm.

30:25.120 --> 30:26.686
You know, Jason, I was thinking, um,

30:26.688 --> 30:29.656
maybe you might want to
come visit me some weekend.

30:30.604 --> 30:33.160
Yeah, I'd like that.

30:33.162 --> 30:34.676
Let's do it sometime.

30:36.298 --> 30:37.597
Okay.

30:37.599 --> 30:40.500
It's too real.
Not our relationship, I get it.

30:40.502 --> 30:45.038
Come on, not at all.
What are you talking about?

30:45.040 --> 30:46.673
It's okay.

30:47.221 --> 30:49.042
All right, you go do what you got to do,

30:49.044 --> 30:51.692
and tell Chunk I'm real sorry
to hear about his friend.

30:52.447 --> 30:53.647
Good night, Jason.

30:53.649 --> 30:55.005
Good night.

31:04.393 --> 31:06.960
I can't figure out juror ten.

31:06.962 --> 31:10.197
He's into sport fishing and yoga.

31:10.199 --> 31:13.162
And he drives a Hummer...
I mean, what is he?

31:13.602 --> 31:15.066
Not my case.

31:15.671 --> 31:17.671
Of course. Sorry.

31:17.673 --> 31:20.494
And I'm sorry about Nella.

31:21.852 --> 31:24.225
She sounds like she was pretty amazing.

31:25.414 --> 31:26.725
She was.

31:27.282 --> 31:30.989
My first real boss, post-football.

31:31.666 --> 31:33.365
She believed in me.

31:34.356 --> 31:35.789
And you believed in her?

31:36.318 --> 31:37.765
Of course.

31:39.742 --> 31:42.042
That's a pretty amazing thing.

31:43.665 --> 31:45.532
To believe in your boss.

31:47.169 --> 31:49.736
Oh... my God.

31:49.738 --> 31:51.871
These prototype shoes.

31:51.873 --> 31:54.274
These are the most amazing things

31:54.276 --> 31:56.042
I've ever had on my feet.

31:58.647 --> 32:00.981
Revolutionary.

32:00.983 --> 32:03.016
I don't understand.

32:03.018 --> 32:04.618
You want to tell the jury

32:04.620 --> 32:05.752
Kira killed Nella?

32:05.754 --> 32:07.687
Will, you have a shot at acquittal.

32:07.689 --> 32:10.090
If we put Kira on the stand
and grill her about the dress,

32:10.092 --> 32:12.359
the jury will have reasonable doubt.

32:12.361 --> 32:14.761
No, they won't. She didn't do it.

32:14.763 --> 32:17.013
Really? Are you sure about that?

32:17.733 --> 32:19.266
Why did she leave early?

32:19.268 --> 32:20.700
After her first turn on the runway.

32:20.702 --> 32:22.869
That is why Nella
had to wear the wedding dress.

32:22.871 --> 32:25.338
Yeah, she said she got sick.

32:25.340 --> 32:27.390
Aha. That's convenient, isn't it?

32:27.392 --> 32:28.975
Do you really believe that?

32:28.977 --> 32:30.277
People are complicated.

32:30.279 --> 32:32.309
Maybe you don't know her
as well as you thought.

32:33.181 --> 32:35.415
You don't know
what you're talking about.

32:36.752 --> 32:38.451
Did she have access to the key?

32:38.453 --> 32:41.321
To where the dress was... did she?

32:41.323 --> 32:42.856
She is hiding something.

32:42.858 --> 32:44.958
I know it, and you can
see it too, can't you?

32:44.960 --> 32:47.394
No, no way. She-she didn't kill Nella.

32:47.396 --> 32:49.062
This keeps you out of prison.

32:49.064 --> 32:51.598
- So the cops will go after my fiancÃ©e?
- Will, if you want

32:51.600 --> 32:53.967
to save your life, let the jury wonder,

32:53.969 --> 32:56.369
just for a second, if Kira did it.

32:56.371 --> 32:59.005
Reasonable doubt. It's your best option.

32:59.007 --> 33:01.541
It's best if I blacken
my future wife's name.

33:01.543 --> 33:05.011
It's best if I risk her life
so I can walk free?

33:05.013 --> 33:06.680
Who am I, then?

33:08.250 --> 33:10.183
I'm committed to the woman I love.

33:10.185 --> 33:12.886
I'm sorry that's so hard
for you to understand.

33:30.444 --> 33:33.946
Hey. Will's gone.

33:33.948 --> 33:35.581
I heard.

33:38.552 --> 33:39.852
I don't know what he's gonna do.

33:39.854 --> 33:41.237
You know where I can find him?

33:44.225 --> 33:46.792
Kira has a gig at the Armory.

33:46.794 --> 33:48.961
Midlea Carmichael's got a small show.

33:48.963 --> 33:50.433
Thank you.

33:51.999 --> 33:54.166
I'll drive.

33:58.906 --> 34:00.026
What?

34:00.941 --> 34:02.975
I'm not helping Will.

34:02.977 --> 34:04.476
I'm helping you.

34:04.478 --> 34:05.849
Okay.

34:08.114 --> 34:10.649
Just... just one second, just, come on.

34:10.650 --> 34:12.784
- I can't do this right now.
- Okay, just-just listen.

34:12.786 --> 34:14.085
- I'm at work.
- Just listen for one second.

34:14.088 --> 34:15.821
If you've done something...

34:15.822 --> 34:18.456
no matter how bad... I want you
to know I don't care, Kira.

34:18.458 --> 34:19.692
I don't care.

34:19.694 --> 34:21.627
I love you.

34:21.629 --> 34:23.161
We can get out.

34:23.164 --> 34:25.496
- We can go. I-I...
- I wouldn't do that.

34:26.701 --> 34:29.034
- Running would be idiotic.
- Yeah, I'm not

34:29.036 --> 34:31.003
asking you. Get out of here.

34:31.005 --> 34:34.206
Stay and fight, Will.

34:35.909 --> 34:37.545
You found somebody.

34:37.945 --> 34:39.545
Somebody you're committed to.

34:39.547 --> 34:42.143
Some people can't even commit
to a weekend, you know that?

34:42.750 --> 34:45.013
You want Will to stay and fight?

34:46.387 --> 34:47.886
Kira...

34:48.398 --> 34:50.101
did you kill Nella?

34:51.826 --> 34:53.166
No.

34:55.596 --> 34:56.995
Did you think that I did?

34:56.996 --> 35:00.566
Well, you abruptly left the show.

35:00.568 --> 35:02.534
That forced her to wear that dress...

35:02.536 --> 35:04.770
the dress that killed her.

35:04.772 --> 35:07.303
You're the same size, right?
Same stature?

35:07.324 --> 35:09.892
What did you think
would happen after you took off?

35:09.894 --> 35:11.393
I didn't take off.

35:11.395 --> 35:13.929
Really? You're the face
of the Nella Wester's line,

35:13.931 --> 35:15.397
you are wearing the big dress

35:15.399 --> 35:18.233
of the evening, you're at
the height of your career,

35:18.235 --> 35:20.235
and you disappear?

35:20.237 --> 35:22.070
I need to know why.

35:22.072 --> 35:24.673
Listen to me. Forget them.

35:24.675 --> 35:27.075
Look at me. Tell me.

35:28.512 --> 35:29.746
What happened?

35:30.748 --> 35:32.915
Here, sit down.

35:34.985 --> 35:36.451
What happened?

35:40.391 --> 35:41.890
She fired me.

35:41.892 --> 35:44.237
What?

35:44.694 --> 35:46.127
W-Why didn't you tell me?

35:46.900 --> 35:49.898
It was humiliating.

35:51.435 --> 35:54.069
I knew that you would
yell at her and probably

35:54.071 --> 35:55.572
get fired, too.

35:59.777 --> 36:01.243
She didn't even have the balls

36:01.245 --> 36:02.820
to do it herself.

36:04.381 --> 36:05.847
Coward.

36:05.849 --> 36:07.783
Wait. Nella didn't

36:07.785 --> 36:10.018
actually tell you you were fired?

36:14.358 --> 36:16.024
Who did?

36:18.195 --> 36:19.661
Giancarlo.

36:19.663 --> 36:22.064
What I didn't appreciate
is what a showman you are.

36:22.066 --> 36:24.199
You love the theatrical side
of fashion, don't you?

36:24.201 --> 36:27.369
The runway, the drama, the intrigue.

36:27.371 --> 36:28.937
You're exactly
the kind of person who would

36:28.939 --> 36:31.106
kill someone with a poison dress.

36:31.108 --> 36:32.460
Don't be absurd.

36:35.091 --> 36:36.945
You told Kira she was fired,
then you told Nella

36:36.947 --> 36:38.146
Kira quit.

36:38.148 --> 36:40.182
No time to find a replacement,
so Nella had to wear

36:40.184 --> 36:41.717
- the wedding dress.
- What I don't understand

36:41.719 --> 36:43.018
is why.

36:43.020 --> 36:44.419
I know you didn't know about the shoes,

36:44.421 --> 36:47.256
so it wasn't about the money.

36:47.258 --> 36:48.624
It was a very personal crime,

36:48.626 --> 36:50.459
designed to humiliate Nella.

36:51.962 --> 36:55.097
Oh, Nella fired <i> you,</i> didn't she?

36:55.099 --> 36:57.833
And then you told Kira

36:57.835 --> 37:00.102
that Nella fired her,

37:00.104 --> 37:03.538
'cause you were
passing along the cruelty.

37:03.540 --> 37:05.674
It's middle child behavior.

37:11.548 --> 37:13.348
Uh-oh. I wouldn't do that

37:13.350 --> 37:14.783
- if I were you.
- Police!

37:14.785 --> 37:17.352
Stop right there! Chunk was a...

37:17.354 --> 37:19.054
All-American football star.

37:24.928 --> 37:26.461
Stay down!

37:26.463 --> 37:28.397
Get off me! Get off me!

37:32.936 --> 37:35.404
After Giancarlo Sartor's
confession to the NYPD,

37:35.406 --> 37:38.040
a search warrant was executed
on his apartment.

37:38.042 --> 37:40.776
I can now announce
that C.S.U. has found traces

37:40.778 --> 37:43.912
of a substance identified
as trivalent arsenic.

37:43.914 --> 37:45.647
This afternoon, Mr. Sartor was charged

37:45.649 --> 37:47.616
with the murder of Nella Wester.

37:47.618 --> 37:51.353
All charges against William
Mercado have been dropped.

37:51.355 --> 37:53.355
Oh, I can't believe it's over.

37:53.357 --> 37:56.091
Giancarlo told NYPD that Nella fired him

37:56.093 --> 37:58.660
so she could make you
her second in command.

37:58.662 --> 38:00.095
Giancarlo snapped.

38:00.097 --> 38:02.164
He couldn't take the idea
that she would fire him

38:02.166 --> 38:04.333
over a newcomer like Will.

38:04.968 --> 38:06.802
Have you guys seen Dr. Bull?

38:07.156 --> 38:08.470
Mm-mm.

38:11.342 --> 38:13.542
Hey. I have news.

38:13.544 --> 38:15.860
A letter from Nella's patent attorney.

38:16.413 --> 38:17.879
The patent for the prototype?

38:17.881 --> 38:20.382
She was filing under your name.

38:21.485 --> 38:23.952
Everything Nella said was true.

38:25.289 --> 38:27.549
Look who I found.

38:27.858 --> 38:30.692
- Hello.
- Hey.

38:30.694 --> 38:32.194
- You ready?
- Yeah, yeah.

38:32.196 --> 38:33.662
Okay. Dr. Bull,

38:33.664 --> 38:36.998
uh, I'm glad we got to
thank you before we go.

38:38.135 --> 38:40.635
Got a meeting with
some VC folks tomorrow.

38:40.637 --> 38:42.704
Ah. Venture capital. Not Viet Cong.

38:42.706 --> 38:44.172
Yeah, thanks for clearing that up.

38:44.174 --> 38:45.774
They're interested in the prototype.

38:45.776 --> 38:48.543
I'm hoping we get the shoes
on the market in 18 months.

38:48.545 --> 38:50.545
Wow. Congratulations.

38:50.547 --> 38:53.048
Well, make sure
you send Marissa a free pair.

38:53.050 --> 38:54.549
She loves those shoes.

38:54.971 --> 38:57.152
Take care, you two.

38:58.789 --> 39:00.856
You're very lucky.

39:02.393 --> 39:05.160
So I was right about Will.

39:05.162 --> 39:06.762
What, you want a medal?

39:06.764 --> 39:07.863
Ah, Stoplight.

39:07.865 --> 39:10.132
- Getting settled in?
- Yes,

39:10.134 --> 39:12.200
- thank you.
- Hey.

39:12.202 --> 39:13.402
What's she doing here?

39:13.404 --> 39:15.170
Well, Allie is my new assistant.

39:15.172 --> 39:17.706
Uh, she's from Wollongong, Australia.

39:17.708 --> 39:19.007
Someone's got to keep this guy in line.

39:19.009 --> 39:20.809
Oh, by the way,

39:20.811 --> 39:23.278
- my friend Autumn, from the show?
- Mm.

39:23.280 --> 39:25.313
She thought you were cute.

39:26.123 --> 39:28.671
A model with daddy issues. Surprise.

39:28.673 --> 39:30.619
- Well, I just texted you her number
- Mm.

39:30.621 --> 39:32.320
And she wants to hear from you.

39:32.322 --> 39:33.588
All right.

39:34.344 --> 39:35.752
See you tomorrow.

39:36.760 --> 39:38.293
Autumn's a nice name.

39:39.968 --> 39:41.062
Good night.

39:52.443 --> 39:54.876
Hey. It's Jason.

39:54.878 --> 39:56.448
Got your message.

39:57.414 --> 39:59.247
Want me to come by?

40:04.288 --> 40:06.221
I'm here.

40:10.928 --> 40:13.795
Hey.

40:16.800 --> 40:18.266
Hey.

40:25.509 --> 40:27.843
If I said I missed you
would that be too real?

40:30.347 --> 40:31.646
Just right.

40:33.617 --> 40:34.983
I'll make you some breakfast.

40:34.985 --> 40:36.485
I didn't know you could cook.

40:36.487 --> 40:39.054
I'm gonna make you my famous
phone call to the diner.

40:39.569 --> 40:41.153
That sounds delicious.
