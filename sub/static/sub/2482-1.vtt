01:22.532 --> 01:24.501
Look, mate, he ain't done nothing wrong.

01:24.533 --> 01:25.680
Out.

01:53.941 --> 01:56.965
Come on. You go stitching yourself up.

01:57.069 --> 01:59.050
Ladies and gentlemen, step up.

01:59.885 --> 02:01.449
Step up.

02:01.553 --> 02:03.639
I, Mercury, the messenger of the Gods,

02:03.743 --> 02:06.454
invite you... invite you, sir,

02:06.559 --> 02:08.436
tonight, for one night only,

02:08.539 --> 02:12.294
here, at this very venue, to enter into the mind,

02:12.398 --> 02:14.380
the very great mind...

02:15.631 --> 02:17.717
...of Doctor Parnassus.

02:17.821 --> 02:19.907
Doctor Parnassus!

02:27.102 --> 02:30.126
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
Doctor Parnassus, as old...

02:30.231 --> 02:31.691
as old as time. Yes.

02:31.795 --> 02:33.463
He is over a thousand years old.

02:33.568 --> 02:37.635
He has the power
to empower your mind.

02:38.365 --> 02:40.867
Let Doctor Parnassus open your imagination.

02:40.972 --> 02:43.266
Let him... let him transport you.

02:45.247 --> 02:48.167
Oh, my God. Oh, check out the lights.

02:48.272 --> 02:49.523
Check out that.

02:49.627 --> 02:52.651
Transcend the heights on Beauty's wing.

02:52.756 --> 02:53.798
Whoa, whoa!

02:53.903 --> 02:55.363
Check this.

02:55.467 --> 02:58.387
Dave, Dave, haway.
Come on, we'll go get these sorted.

02:58.491 --> 02:59.847
Check this out, sweetheart.

02:59.951 --> 03:01.620
Come here, my love, near me.

03:01.724 --> 03:03.497
Come on, love ...

03:03.601 --> 03:06.729
Where is he, then? Come on.

03:14.863 --> 03:16.115
If you must...

03:16.219 --> 03:19.139
scour the squalid depths

03:19.243 --> 03:21.642
with Putrid's brother, Stench...

03:22.997 --> 03:24.979
Raaaa!

03:25.083 --> 03:26.439
Join the queue.

03:26.543 --> 03:27.899
Only five quid a go.

03:28.003 --> 03:29.671
Bang. Bang.

03:32.070 --> 03:34.677
You choose... you choose...
you choose fulfilment?

03:34.781 --> 03:37.493
- Whoa!
- Sir, please... Sir, please, if you will...

03:38.744 --> 03:42.498
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

03:42.602 --> 03:46.357
Sir, please, you cannot audition
without a ticket, I'm afraid, sir.

03:46.461 --> 03:47.921
- Give us a kiss.
- Please don't.

03:48.755 --> 03:50.632
- Hey...
- You all right down there, mate?

03:50.841 --> 03:53.969
- All right, Captain Planet?
- Get off the stage, you damn drunk.

03:54.073 --> 03:55.951
What are you doing, little man?

03:56.055 --> 03:58.036
He's got us by the leg.

04:01.060 --> 04:02.520
Ha-hey!

04:02.625 --> 04:04.606
Hey, man, check it out.
It's not even real.

04:04.710 --> 04:05.649
Hey!

04:05.753 --> 04:06.900
Get off the stage!

04:09.194 --> 04:12.531
- Mm, that's a nice pair of tits.
- I said, get off the stage!

04:12.636 --> 04:13.887
Nah.

04:13.991 --> 04:16.807
I want you, like. Come here, man.

04:17.641 --> 04:19.831
Come here, man.
Hey, hey, come here!

04:19.935 --> 04:21.500
Hey-hey!

04:25.358 --> 04:26.922
What are you running away for?

04:35.995 --> 04:39.436
- Yoo-hoo!
- There she is!

04:39.540 --> 04:41.939
Come 'ere, gorgeous. Come 'ere...

04:46.632 --> 04:48.404
Oh, shite.

04:48.509 --> 04:49.864
I'm coming after...

04:49.969 --> 04:51.950
I'm gonna feel your arse.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.667
Come here, gorgeous.

05:07.280 --> 05:09.261
Come back, you bitch!

05:19.585 --> 05:21.253
Me nose!

05:23.548 --> 05:25.320
Ohhh...

05:25.425 --> 05:27.823
Oh, my face!

05:27.927 --> 05:29.909
My face! My gorgeous face!

05:37.417 --> 05:38.773
Martin!

05:38.877 --> 05:40.650
He went with that cow!

05:40.754 --> 05:43.153
- I'll scratch her eyes out!
- Oi, you two.

05:44.195 --> 05:46.177
My boyfriend is in there!

05:46.281 --> 05:48.262
Anybody there?

05:52.329 --> 05:53.789
Anybody there?

05:53.894 --> 05:57.231
Please, is anybody there?

05:57.335 --> 05:59.525
Please! Please!

06:06.199 --> 06:07.867
Mum!

06:07.972 --> 06:08.597
Aaargh!

06:15.584 --> 06:17.253
Help me!

06:21.215 --> 06:23.093
Please...

06:23.197 --> 06:25.074
I'll never drink again. I promise.

06:26.430 --> 06:27.994
Honest.

06:29.349 --> 06:31.227
From now on, I swear, not a drop.

06:31.331 --> 06:33.312
Oh, really?

06:42.593 --> 06:44.575
Whoo!

07:08.560 --> 07:10.645
<i>You have chosen well.</i>

07:11.375 --> 07:13.982
<i>The path to Parnassus is steep.</i>

07:14.086 --> 07:16.068
<i>The way is long.</i>

07:16.172 --> 07:17.841
<i>But with perseverance,</i>

07:18.049 --> 07:19.405
<i>and fierce dedication,</i>

07:19.509 --> 07:22.116
<i>the heights are attainable.</i>

07:22.220 --> 07:25.975
<i>So with spirits high
and a spring in your step,</i>

07:26.079 --> 07:27.226
<i>with a song in your heart,</i>

07:27.330 --> 07:28.790
<i>the clouds will part,</i>

07:28.895 --> 07:30.563
<i>the heavens will open</i>

07:30.667 --> 07:33.587
<i>and you will be a man, my son.</i>

07:35.360 --> 07:38.697
Hi there. Come on in.

07:38.801 --> 07:41.930
Looks like you could use a drink.

07:44.745 --> 07:46.623
Maybe just the one.

07:49.542 --> 07:50.481
Hey!

07:51.837 --> 07:53.818
Make mine a double!

07:56.842 --> 07:58.719
Oh!

08:00.909 --> 08:02.891
He won, I lost.

08:03.725 --> 08:05.602
I lost again.

08:07.270 --> 08:09.252
- What were you doing?
- He was chasing me.

08:09.356 --> 08:12.067
- What was I supposed to...
- Don't go through the mirror.

08:12.172 --> 08:14.987
- Never. You know that.
- Oi, you!

08:16.134 --> 08:17.386
Gunga Din.

08:17.490 --> 08:19.471
Come 'ere.

08:21.244 --> 08:22.808
What do you think you're playing at?

08:22.913 --> 08:24.685
Playing? Oh, no, no, no.

08:24.790 --> 08:26.145
We don't play.

08:26.250 --> 08:28.440
What we do is deadly serious.

08:31.777 --> 08:33.236
Gone.

08:33.341 --> 08:35.635
Will we miss him? I don't think so.

08:59.516 --> 09:02.644
Don't worry
if you don't understand it all immediately.

09:05.773 --> 09:09.005
Right, look,
I want you freaks out of here, now.

09:09.110 --> 09:10.048
Ow!

09:10.152 --> 09:13.489
Sorry, I didn't mean to use that word.
All right? Vertically deficient.

09:13.594 --> 09:14.324
Defunct?

09:14.428 --> 09:15.367
Vertically d...

09:15.471 --> 09:17.556
Vertically challenged. Vertically...

09:17.661 --> 09:21.623
Vertically challenged. Whatever you are,
get off of my beat or I will do you.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.501
- You included.
- D'accord. D'accord.

09:23.605 --> 09:24.960
- Who threw that?
- Bonne nuit.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.420
You're nicked.

09:34.659 --> 09:36.953
Take a ticket. Wait your turn.

09:37.057 --> 09:38.621
Only 20 quid a go.

09:38.726 --> 09:40.290
Reduced to five for one night only.

09:40.394 --> 09:43.731
Ladies and gentlemen,
this world, this world that we live in...

09:43.836 --> 09:46.338
is full of enchantment...

09:46.443 --> 09:48.737
for those with eyes to see it.

09:49.467 --> 09:50.092
Chicken!

09:52.178 --> 09:54.264
I want to go there, there and there.

09:54.368 --> 09:56.454
- I want something to eat.
- Stop going on.

09:56.558 --> 09:58.226
No. They won't let you, darling.

09:58.331 --> 09:59.999
But I want to, I want to.

10:00.104 --> 10:01.772
- Linda!
- You never let me...

10:01.876 --> 10:03.962
Excuse me. Excuse me.

10:04.901 --> 10:07.090
Do you mind?

10:10.010 --> 10:10.636
Anton.

10:10.845 --> 10:12.617
Anton, he went back there.

10:13.660 --> 10:16.789
- Just go and er...
- I'm going to go back. Ssh.

10:16.893 --> 10:20.230
Diego! Diego!

10:57.250 --> 10:58.397
Die.

10:58.814 --> 11:00.274
Die! Yes.

11:03.611 --> 11:04.341
Yes.

11:04.446 --> 11:07.991
<i>Please exit the lmaginarium immediately.</i>

11:08.095 --> 11:11.537
<i>Choice is not available without parental consent.</i>

11:11.641 --> 11:13.518
Die!

11:13.622 --> 11:15.291
Yeah!

11:18.732 --> 11:23.425
If one of you perverts has got our boy,
I won't be answerable for my actions.

11:23.529 --> 11:25.302
- Diego!
- Diego!

11:25.406 --> 11:26.762
Diego!

11:26.866 --> 11:28.743
Ah...

11:31.038 --> 11:32.393
W-What?

11:32.497 --> 11:35.209
- She's not looking for him.
- I don't care!

11:35.209 --> 11:36.877
Hello.

11:37.712 --> 11:38.442
Voilà.

11:40.631 --> 11:41.987
- Yeah!
- Oh, it worked!

11:42.091 --> 11:44.490
Where have you been? I've been worried sick.

11:44.594 --> 11:47.201
One little devil out of the fire...

11:47.306 --> 11:50.225
Wipe that silly expression off your face,
you little poof. Get up.

11:50.330 --> 11:53.250
The astounding world of Doctor Parnassus.
Thank you.

11:55.022 --> 11:56.169
- Anton?
- Yes, sir.

11:56.274 --> 12:00.549
- You know the rules about the mirror?
- Yes, I do. I'm sorry, sir. I'm really...

12:00.654 --> 12:02.426
- He was a ten-year-old boy.
- I know.

12:02.531 --> 12:04.303
You did well, my boy. You did well.

12:04.408 --> 12:06.389
Good lad. Good lad.

12:07.223 --> 12:08.788
Thank you.

12:08.892 --> 12:11.499
- Good lad. Good lad.
- Thank you.

12:11.603 --> 12:13.689
You go through the mirror
and he's all over you.

12:13.793 --> 12:15.983
I do it once and he serves you
my head on a plate.

12:16.087 --> 12:18.694
Come on now, Valentina.
You're his daughter.

12:18.799 --> 12:21.510
Do you know what I mean?
And you're scrumptious...

12:21.614 --> 12:24.013
His scrumptious daughter.

12:24.117 --> 12:26.098
Why did I say "scrumptious"?

12:27.454 --> 12:29.331
Beautiful.

12:29.435 --> 12:31.417
Intelligent. Sweet.

12:31.521 --> 12:33.398
"Scrumptious"? Idiot!

13:03.640 --> 13:05.413
Hey, Parny.

13:09.688 --> 13:10.835
It's been a while.

13:10.940 --> 13:12.817
Whoa... Last call.

13:12.921 --> 13:15.320
- Hey, Anton.
- Yes, Percy?

13:15.424 --> 13:18.552
- What did I say?
- Stop Percying about.

13:18.657 --> 13:20.534
We don't have all night.

13:22.619 --> 13:24.601
Bloody kids again.

13:25.539 --> 13:27.729
- What's up, Doc?
- Hey!

13:28.668 --> 13:31.170
Don't we love our children?

13:33.152 --> 13:35.029
She's ripe as a peach.

13:35.133 --> 13:37.323
Sweet little 16.

13:37.427 --> 13:39.304
And all mine!

13:45.979 --> 13:47.960
He's come to collect.

13:48.898 --> 13:50.775
I thought so.

13:50.880 --> 13:52.444
He's early.

13:52.548 --> 13:54.425
What can I do?

13:55.364 --> 13:57.032
Nothing.

13:57.137 --> 13:59.014
There must be something.

14:00.787 --> 14:02.559
How many days left?

14:02.664 --> 14:04.645
Three.

14:08.399 --> 14:11.006
You know, you're gonna have to tell her soon.

14:21.747 --> 14:27.587
♪ When the moon hits your eye
like a big pizza pie

14:27.691 --> 14:29.464
♪ That's amore...

14:29.568 --> 14:31.550
Will you shut up about food?

14:31.654 --> 14:34.261
We're plum out. And I'm starving.

14:34.365 --> 14:38.224
Oh, Percy, we've still got
a couple of potatoes left.

14:43.334 --> 14:46.149
- Ooh, look at this.
- Hey, that's mine.

14:46.254 --> 14:48.026
Oh, won't you look at that? That is...

14:48.131 --> 14:50.008
- That's private!
- It's gorgeous.

14:50.112 --> 14:52.823
- Give it.
- All that mahogany, oh!

14:52.928 --> 14:55.743
Anton!

14:57.307 --> 14:59.289
Would you really be happy in a place like that?

14:59.393 --> 15:00.540
Would you?

15:00.644 --> 15:02.939
I wouldn't. I couldn't do it, I don't think.

15:03.982 --> 15:05.963
Well, maybe if I was with you.

15:10.134 --> 15:11.594
Ah-ah!

15:16.704 --> 15:17.642
Sssh.

15:17.747 --> 15:20.562
You're always talking about escaping,
aren't you?

15:21.292 --> 15:24.317
Always thinking about it.
Always dreaming about it.

15:27.758 --> 15:28.905
Let's do it.

15:29.843 --> 15:32.451
- Why not? You and me.
- I can't run away.

15:32.555 --> 15:34.745
- You and me.
- We can't run away. I can't.

15:35.892 --> 15:37.665
I'm underage.

15:37.769 --> 15:39.646
Oh, don't do that.

15:40.480 --> 15:42.670
I shall be 12 on Wednesday.

15:42.774 --> 15:43.817
Don't be ridiculous.

15:43.922 --> 15:46.633
Percy, how old will I be on Wednesday?

15:46.737 --> 15:47.467
12.

15:47.571 --> 15:49.344
Ha! See?

15:49.448 --> 15:50.908
Parnassus says so too.

15:51.013 --> 15:54.037
- Are you trying to say he's ridiculous?
- No.

15:55.705 --> 15:57.478
Actually,

15:58.208 --> 16:00.190
I'm really going to be 16.

16:02.275 --> 16:04.257
Sweet 16.

16:06.446 --> 16:08.636
The age of consent.

16:19.377 --> 16:21.359
Is that you, Scrumpy?

16:21.463 --> 16:23.549
Who the hell else is it gonna be?

16:24.487 --> 16:26.573
Oi, you haven't eaten any of this!

16:26.677 --> 16:28.763
- Yes, I know, I know.
- And that again?

16:28.867 --> 16:31.161
For God's sakes, Dad! Put 'em up.

16:31.266 --> 16:33.977
Come on. You're always taking
the easy way out.

16:34.081 --> 16:36.063
No, no. Not now, Scrumpy. Not now.

16:37.627 --> 16:41.068
I have something very important
that I have to tell you.

16:42.215 --> 16:44.614
Oh, why does everybody
want to live forever?

16:44.718 --> 16:46.595
Lmmortality is a bloody curse.

16:46.699 --> 16:49.619
So is pretending to be a 12-year-old child,
damn it.

16:49.724 --> 16:51.392
Look at me. I mean...

16:52.122 --> 16:53.999
Look at me. Nobody's fooled.

16:54.103 --> 16:57.545
And I want this stupid thing off my ankle too,
while we're at it.

16:57.649 --> 17:00.465
You can't stop me growing up
just by lying about my birthday.

17:00.569 --> 17:02.759
Shut up and listen to me!

17:02.863 --> 17:05.992
I have to explain something to you
before it's too late.

17:06.826 --> 17:08.807
One winter night...

17:08.911 --> 17:12.144
- Is this gonna take long?
- Yes, yes, yes, quite possibly.

17:12.248 --> 17:13.290
Many years ago...

17:13.396 --> 17:16.837
Er... many centuries ago, in fact,

17:17.671 --> 17:21.738
when I was - believe it or not -
a young monk,

17:23.511 --> 17:25.701
someone visited me in my sanctuary,

17:27.265 --> 17:30.394
someone I had hoped never to meet.

17:31.645 --> 17:33.001
Someone...

17:34.252 --> 17:37.693
...none of us should ever hope to meet.

18:21.700 --> 18:23.577
Having captured the wind,

18:23.682 --> 18:25.663
tamed the storm,

18:25.767 --> 18:29.313
kept the stars in their orbits
and the earth turning on its axis,

18:30.773 --> 18:33.797
the Chief Steward,
lying down to take his rest,

18:34.840 --> 18:36.717
had a most disturbing dream.

18:39.324 --> 18:44.121
He dreamt that a hooded rider
was fast approaching on the snowswept plain.

18:45.268 --> 18:47.249
The Chief Steward woke.

19:13.111 --> 19:15.927
And so the Steward set out
on his great journey...

19:16.031 --> 19:19.994
- What exactly do you all do here?
- We tell the eternal story.

19:21.037 --> 19:22.914
And what is that, exactly?

19:23.644 --> 19:25.729
The story that sustains the universe.

19:27.398 --> 19:29.692
The story without which there is nothing.

19:33.238 --> 19:34.385
Nothing?

19:35.741 --> 19:37.513
You mean...

19:37.618 --> 19:41.893
stop telling the story
and the whole universe ceases to exist?

19:41.998 --> 19:43.875
You make it sound so simple.

19:46.065 --> 19:47.420
And you believe it?

19:48.359 --> 19:50.236
We are ordained for this task.

19:50.340 --> 19:52.530
It's just incredible to me,

19:52.634 --> 19:56.284
that you can believe something
that can be so easily disproved.

19:56.388 --> 19:58.370
Oh, I don't think so.

19:58.995 --> 20:00.143
Hm.

20:01.185 --> 20:02.958
We'll see.

20:03.062 --> 20:05.252
- I will gather a thousand...
- So.

20:10.258 --> 20:11.301
Stop!

20:11.405 --> 20:14.429
...having been brought to the limit
of his endurance...

20:15.889 --> 20:18.705
Yet the forces of evil could not prevail...

20:22.250 --> 20:24.127
...our calmness of...

20:27.882 --> 20:28.820
There.

20:29.550 --> 20:31.219
The story stopped.

20:32.053 --> 20:33.826
No more story.

20:33.930 --> 20:35.807
But we're still here.

20:36.641 --> 20:38.623
The fire's still burning.

20:39.665 --> 20:42.273
It's still snowing. The wind's still blowing.

20:44.358 --> 20:46.340
Nothing has changed.

20:47.904 --> 20:50.198
Come on, cheer up, Doc.

20:50.302 --> 20:53.118
I've freed you from
all this ridiculous nonsense.

20:54.786 --> 20:56.976
Now you can do other things with your powers.

20:57.081 --> 20:58.645
You can erm...

20:58.749 --> 21:00.730
I dunno, you can go shopping.

21:01.460 --> 21:03.025
Have fun.

21:04.067 --> 21:08.343
You can learn a foreign language or...
or go on a cruise.

21:14.913 --> 21:15.851
God!

21:15.956 --> 21:17.520
Damn it!

21:19.918 --> 21:21.795
A sign, a message.

21:23.777 --> 21:25.237
That bird was a messenger...

21:26.071 --> 21:28.991
from some distant place
that we know nothing of.

21:30.868 --> 21:32.849
Oh, I see it all now,

21:33.788 --> 21:35.665
so clear.

21:36.499 --> 21:38.793
This has nothing to do with us here.

21:38.898 --> 21:42.130
Somewhere in this world, right now,

21:42.235 --> 21:44.737
someone else is telling a story.

21:44.842 --> 21:47.657
A different story - a saga or romance,

21:47.762 --> 21:51.203
a tale of unforeseen death - it doesn't matter.

21:51.307 --> 21:53.184
It's sustaining the universe.

21:55.061 --> 21:57.043
That's why we're still here.

21:59.024 --> 22:01.005
You can't stop stories being told.

22:02.153 --> 22:04.134
That's a weak hypothesis.

22:04.238 --> 22:06.220
I don't think so.

22:08.618 --> 22:12.059
Say, you're probably not a betting man,
are you?

22:12.164 --> 22:13.936
What?

22:14.666 --> 22:17.482
And that was my first wager with the Devil.

22:21.341 --> 22:23.322
You see, the very first of us to...

22:24.365 --> 22:28.223
...attract 12 disciples would win the bet.

22:28.327 --> 22:30.309
His argument:

22:30.413 --> 22:34.376
The necessities of danger, of fear,
of the fabled bliss of ignorance.

22:35.001 --> 22:36.566
Mine:

22:36.670 --> 22:40.528
The power of the imagination
to transform and illuminate our lives.

22:42.614 --> 22:45.221
It was a hard fight but I won.

22:47.411 --> 22:48.871
My prize?

22:48.975 --> 22:53.147
The one thing I coveted most -
everlasting life.

22:54.711 --> 22:56.066
Huh.

22:56.171 --> 22:58.152
Everlasting torment.

23:00.551 --> 23:02.845
He tricked me. He let me win.

23:05.348 --> 23:07.329
He knew that times would change.

23:08.685 --> 23:11.813
And that one day,
no-one would want my stories.

23:13.377 --> 23:15.254
<i>This was the price of my arrogance.</i>

23:17.757 --> 23:20.677
<i>Forgotten, lost, alone.</i>

23:22.033 --> 23:23.493
<i>Desperate.</i>

23:27.455 --> 23:29.020
We've stopped.

23:29.124 --> 23:31.105
Go on with your story.

23:31.209 --> 23:32.982
No, another time.

23:33.087 --> 23:35.485
Something's happened.
You'd better go and see.

23:35.589 --> 23:39.865
Why do you always do this?
You always stop in the middle of your stories.

23:53.943 --> 23:56.446
Valentina, come here.
Valentina, come here.

23:56.550 --> 23:59.366
I just saw someone...
someone dancing on the water.

24:01.243 --> 24:02.807
I swear. I swear.

24:03.641 --> 24:06.457
When the lightning flashed,
there was a shadow...

24:07.083 --> 24:09.168
...thrown from those pillars over there.

24:09.272 --> 24:11.671
Do you see that?
Do you see the dancer?

24:11.775 --> 24:15.112
- Yeah, he's river dancing.
- Yeah, he's river dancing. See that?

24:15.946 --> 24:17.928
That's someone hanging!

24:18.762 --> 24:20.743
He must be under this bridge.

24:20.848 --> 24:22.516
Hanging?

24:22.621 --> 24:24.080
Get a rope.

24:24.185 --> 24:26.583
If he's hanging by his neck,
he's already got a rope.

24:26.688 --> 24:27.835
- Get a rope!
- OK.

24:28.773 --> 24:31.693
Slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly!
Percy, Percy! Christ!

24:35.447 --> 24:37.220
All right, all right.

24:37.324 --> 24:39.827
OK, lower, lower, lower. All right.

24:40.661 --> 24:41.913
Stop, stop!

24:42.017 --> 24:43.894
Jesus. Agh. All right. OK.

24:43.998 --> 24:45.771
OK. OK.

24:45.875 --> 24:47.023
OK.

24:47.127 --> 24:48.795
No, I can't... I can't reach him.

24:48.900 --> 24:50.881
Hold on, I'll swing you.

24:52.550 --> 24:54.531
I'm gonna swing you in.

24:55.261 --> 24:57.242
All right, try again.

24:59.224 --> 25:00.788
Whoaagh!

25:04.021 --> 25:06.002
Again, up.

25:08.400 --> 25:09.026
Yes.

25:14.866 --> 25:16.117
I've got him.

25:16.222 --> 25:18.307
Oh, my God, what am I doing? Oh, my God!

25:19.350 --> 25:21.331
Sir, are you all right?

25:21.436 --> 25:23.313
OK, I've got you here.

25:24.043 --> 25:25.398
Get in there.

25:25.503 --> 25:28.527
OK, put your arms round me.
Put your arms round me. Oh, jeez!

25:28.631 --> 25:29.882
OK.

25:29.987 --> 25:31.655
All right.

25:33.220 --> 25:35.097
Come on. Stay with me, mate.

25:35.201 --> 25:37.078
Aarrghh!

25:37.912 --> 25:39.685
You've done it. Brilliant!

25:39.789 --> 25:41.875
- OK, pull him up.
- Pull me up!

25:41.979 --> 25:43.648
Jesus Christ!

26:00.333 --> 26:02.106
Whoagh!

26:02.836 --> 26:04.817
- Are you OK?
- Oh, God!

26:09.510 --> 26:12.325
Why are you fishing dead people
out of the river?

26:12.430 --> 26:14.411
Leave him be, for the love of God!

26:14.515 --> 26:15.662
He's dead!

26:15.767 --> 26:19.416
Let's get the hell out of here
before the fuzz turns up.

26:20.981 --> 26:22.962
Anton, help me.

26:24.005 --> 26:27.238
- Help her.
- All right, I've got him.

26:27.342 --> 26:29.010
Watch your head.

26:29.115 --> 26:31.096
Pull him this way.

26:34.746 --> 26:36.727
No, no, no, Val. It's not gonna work.

26:36.832 --> 26:38.709
It's not gonna work. Watch out.

26:38.813 --> 26:40.899
You don't know where he's been, anyway.

26:41.003 --> 26:42.984
Ready? All clear?

26:44.131 --> 26:44.966
Ohh!

26:46.113 --> 26:47.364
Oh!

26:47.468 --> 26:49.450
- He's alive!
- He was.

26:54.351 --> 26:56.332
What on earth is that?

26:57.271 --> 26:59.252
- We'll put him in the trunk.
- But...

26:59.356 --> 27:01.234
- What?
- The boss said leave him.

27:01.338 --> 27:03.215
He thought he was dead. Come on.

27:12.913 --> 27:14.895
No, no, no. I don't like this.

27:14.999 --> 27:17.397
This just doesn't...
It's none of our business.

27:17.502 --> 27:20.526
What do you suggest, that we leave
him on the side of the road?

27:20.630 --> 27:22.611
Definitely. Let's go.

27:22.716 --> 27:24.071
All right.

27:24.176 --> 27:26.157
Careful.

27:26.261 --> 27:28.243
- Anton, come on!
- Percy!

27:28.347 --> 27:30.328
Percy, you dropped these.

27:31.371 --> 27:32.727
Giddy up!

27:32.831 --> 27:34.812
Val! Val, come on!

27:35.647 --> 27:37.628
Jump up.

28:31.125 --> 28:32.585
Hey, you!

28:32.689 --> 28:35.713
I suppose somebody saves your life
every day of the week.

28:35.817 --> 28:37.382
What?

28:37.486 --> 28:39.884
Is it too much of a bother for a mere thank you?

28:40.719 --> 28:42.596
Who are you?

28:42.700 --> 28:47.601
Percival St Antoine della Touraine
et Sansepolcro da Piemonte III.

28:48.331 --> 28:51.668
And if that seems too difficult,
you can call me Percy.

28:51.773 --> 28:53.233
Where the hell are we?

28:53.337 --> 28:57.821
Geographically, in the northern hemisphere,
socially, on the margins,

28:57.925 --> 28:59.907
and narratively, with some way to go.

29:00.845 --> 29:02.514
And your name is?

29:02.618 --> 29:04.182
Uh...

29:06.268 --> 29:07.936
I can't remember.

29:08.041 --> 29:09.813
That's frigging handy!

29:09.918 --> 29:11.899
Any credit cards?

29:12.003 --> 29:13.672
Are you trying to rob me?

29:13.776 --> 29:15.340
What are you doing?

29:15.445 --> 29:17.426
With your name on them.

29:17.530 --> 29:19.512
Oh, right, er...

29:20.554 --> 29:23.370
Where's my wallet? Where's my phone?
What have you done with it?

29:23.474 --> 29:25.456
- Don't look at us.
- Who are you?

29:25.560 --> 29:27.750
He doesn't remember.

29:27.854 --> 29:32.651
Listen, er... whoever you people are,
and whatever it is you get up to,

29:33.485 --> 29:35.050
I'm cool with it.

29:35.154 --> 29:37.344
I won't tell anyone about it and er...

29:38.178 --> 29:40.055
I'm gonna go now, all right?

29:50.796 --> 29:52.986
It's probably for you.

29:54.863 --> 29:56.219
Oh.

29:56.845 --> 29:58.826
Here's my phone.

29:58.930 --> 30:00.599
<i>There you are.</i>

30:01.224 --> 30:03.206
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

30:12.278 --> 30:13.634
Pity.

30:13.738 --> 30:15.303
I speak Russian.

30:17.284 --> 30:18.952
Oh, hello.

30:19.787 --> 30:21.664
Are you all right?

30:22.811 --> 30:24.479
Yeah.

30:24.584 --> 30:26.565
Yeah, it's just I feel...

30:26.669 --> 30:30.006
I think I need a place to gather
my thoughts for a little bit.

30:30.111 --> 30:31.779
Sorry, mate. Sorry, mate.

30:31.883 --> 30:33.865
Thank you for that but you can't stay.

30:33.969 --> 30:35.325
Why not?

30:35.429 --> 30:37.306
What do you mean? Look at him.

30:37.410 --> 30:39.392
We... We don't know who he is.

30:39.496 --> 30:41.164
We don't know what he's done.

30:41.269 --> 30:43.459
Listen, I haven't done anything, mate.

30:43.563 --> 30:45.127
- All right?
- Oh, right.

30:45.231 --> 30:49.194
I understand where you're coming from,
but understand where I'm coming from.

30:49.298 --> 30:52.427
I don't know my name.
You know, I don't know how I got here.

30:52.531 --> 30:56.702
I don't know who you are or who she is,
and I certainly don't know what that is.

30:56.807 --> 30:58.267
You know?

30:58.371 --> 31:01.395
The last thing I remember
is being whacked in the head,

31:01.499 --> 31:05.671
waking up in that box, in the back of this...
whatever the hell this thing is.

31:05.775 --> 31:07.652
And I just... I just...

31:21.313 --> 31:23.503
Oh, my head!

31:27.674 --> 31:29.343
What the hell's going on here?

31:31.116 --> 31:33.097
I told you to leave him. He was dead.

31:33.201 --> 31:34.974
Well, he isn't and we didn't.

31:35.078 --> 31:37.372
We found him hanging
under the bridge, sir.

31:37.477 --> 31:39.041
- Hanging?
- Yeah.

31:39.145 --> 31:42.274
By his neck till dead, if we had any sense.

31:42.378 --> 31:44.672
We found these in his pockets. Two of these.

31:48.114 --> 31:50.095
The Hanged Man.

31:51.033 --> 31:53.119
Scrumpy, get out of my way.

31:56.978 --> 31:57.812
No.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.897
Signs are all clear.

32:01.357 --> 32:03.339
And those marks!

32:03.443 --> 32:05.633
- I recognise them.
- What marks?

32:05.737 --> 32:08.657
You've been sent by Mr Nick, haven't you?

32:08.761 --> 32:11.681
- Mr Nick?
- I knew it. You know his name.

32:11.786 --> 32:12.516
No.

32:12.620 --> 32:14.914
He's got a proposition for me, hasn't he?

32:15.018 --> 32:16.895
A new wager, perhaps,

32:17.938 --> 32:19.815
or another twist in the game?

32:19.920 --> 32:22.110
He can't help himself, can he?

32:23.048 --> 32:25.655
Thank God! Thank God for that!

32:31.286 --> 32:33.372
Dad says you should work.

32:33.476 --> 32:35.458
Help focus your mind.

32:35.562 --> 32:38.169
I don't know,
it might bring your memory back.

32:38.273 --> 32:41.193
Ah, here we are. Try this.

32:41.297 --> 32:42.966
Thanks.

32:50.996 --> 32:52.873
You can help out front.

32:52.977 --> 32:55.271
Sell tickets or something like that.

32:57.357 --> 32:59.025
What do you think?

32:59.130 --> 33:00.485
Hm?

33:02.258 --> 33:03.718
OK.

33:07.472 --> 33:09.454
So... no name

33:09.558 --> 33:11.435
and now no face?

33:12.269 --> 33:14.042
The mystery thickens.

33:14.146 --> 33:16.128
Get your grubby hands...

33:17.588 --> 33:19.465
All right. That's not necessary.

33:19.569 --> 33:21.967
- Valentina, we got a problem.
- So strange.

33:22.072 --> 33:23.949
Just a complete blank, you know.

33:24.053 --> 33:26.243
I can dress myself.

33:26.347 --> 33:28.224
Let me go, I said!

33:29.476 --> 33:30.831
Let me go!

33:35.524 --> 33:38.027
Ow. Hey, come on.

33:38.131 --> 33:40.112
Doctor.

33:41.781 --> 33:43.658
Oh, God, he's gonna be sick.

33:44.909 --> 33:45.744
Aha!

33:45.848 --> 33:48.038
Is your memory less impaired?

33:48.142 --> 33:50.019
Is it all coming back to you now?

33:50.124 --> 33:51.584
What?

33:52.418 --> 33:55.546
Ah, you're bloody useless.
You're a flaming disaster.

33:55.651 --> 33:57.528
You can't go on. You're drunk.

33:57.632 --> 34:00.760
I'm not drunk! I'm grumpy... Scrumpy.

34:03.993 --> 34:05.349
Er...

34:08.581 --> 34:10.771
L-L-Ladies and gentlemen,

34:10.876 --> 34:12.857
raise your sights for one night only.

34:12.960 --> 34:14.630
Encounter...

34:14.734 --> 34:16.610
Percy, where's George gone?

34:16.715 --> 34:19.947
...the majesty, the beauty,
the miracle that's in each...

34:20.053 --> 34:22.868
Anton, where's George?

34:22.972 --> 34:25.475
Who... Who's George?

34:25.579 --> 34:27.561
I thought we should give him a name.

34:28.603 --> 34:30.481
All right, that's cute.

34:30.585 --> 34:35.172
Saint George, in fact. To be precise.
Well, hello there, darling.

34:35.277 --> 34:38.822
Oh, that's a lovely scarf.
It matches those lovely eyes of yours.

34:39.866 --> 34:43.099
Well, actually, I'm here to sell a show.
Want to see a magic show?

34:43.203 --> 34:45.289
Thank God for that. Not a single customer.

34:45.393 --> 34:47.270
- I'm closing up.
- Let's do that.

34:47.373 --> 34:49.877
He's never not done a show before.

34:54.047 --> 34:55.926
- All right.
- N-n-n-no.

34:56.030 --> 34:58.011
No, what are you doing?

34:58.115 --> 35:00.618
I'm doing my job, mate.
Now, come on, do yours.

35:00.723 --> 35:04.477
Do yours. Go juggle.
You're doing your thing, you look beautiful.

35:04.581 --> 35:07.084
OK. Ladies and...

35:07.188 --> 35:08.752
Well, ladies.

35:08.857 --> 35:14.175
I am very proud to present to you
the one, the only, the extraordinary...

35:14.279 --> 35:16.261
Doctor Parnassus.

35:16.365 --> 35:20.328
♪ I'm a little teapot short and stout

35:20.432 --> 35:23.352
♪ Here's my handle and here's my spout...

35:23.456 --> 35:25.437
Urgh!

35:26.063 --> 35:27.627
Dad?

35:27.732 --> 35:29.609
This man is drunk!

35:29.713 --> 35:31.903
- Dead drunk!
- Oh, that's disgraceful!

35:32.007 --> 35:34.197
- He's not drunk.
- No, he's not. He's...

35:34.301 --> 35:36.283
- Got a bad cold.
- And you know what?

35:36.387 --> 35:39.620
Despite that, he still went on,
for his audience, for you...

35:39.724 --> 35:42.748
at considerable risk for his health.

35:42.852 --> 35:46.711
And I think that is worthy of a round of applause,
ladies and gentlemen.

35:46.815 --> 35:49.005
- What a man.
- We want our money back.

35:49.109 --> 35:50.569
Every penny.

35:50.674 --> 35:52.551
Well, you...

35:53.594 --> 35:56.305
All right, listen.
You can have your money back.

35:57.035 --> 35:58.808
I understand, but I... Listen.

35:58.912 --> 36:01.519
To tell you the truth, the Doctor's daughter...

36:01.623 --> 36:03.813
I know she looks pretty but she ain't...

36:04.647 --> 36:06.629
She's pretty sick, see?

36:06.733 --> 36:08.610
She needs surgery.

36:08.714 --> 36:12.156
So we're trying to scrounge
all we can get. Otherwise she's gonna...

36:12.260 --> 36:15.180
That's what all this is about -
to try and get money for her.

36:16.327 --> 36:18.204
Do you understand? I mean...

36:19.768 --> 36:21.750
How about this?

36:21.854 --> 36:24.670
We'll give you a free ticket -
no, two free tickets -

36:24.774 --> 36:26.755
if you buy another one at half price.

36:26.860 --> 36:29.154
Er... this offer's only available today.

36:31.865 --> 36:33.742
All right, go on.

36:36.349 --> 36:38.331
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

36:39.373 --> 36:42.606
This offer is only available today.

36:46.256 --> 36:48.237
- He took all that?
- Yeah.

36:48.342 --> 36:50.323
Have you ever seen so much?

36:50.427 --> 36:53.451
That is what lying
through your teeth can get you.

36:53.556 --> 36:55.537
Come on, Anton.

36:55.641 --> 36:58.666
How was he to know that
we're not gonna be here tomorrow?

37:00.543 --> 37:02.315
Hey, maybe my birthday won't be so bad.

37:02.420 --> 37:04.297
Yeah, maybe it won't, actually.

37:04.401 --> 37:07.842
Maybe with George here,
maybe you could get out of this dump.

37:09.719 --> 37:11.597
Go find your ideal home.

37:14.516 --> 37:15.872
Anton.

37:17.541 --> 37:20.252
George! Wrong end of the horse, mate.

37:20.356 --> 37:22.338
What's the...

37:32.662 --> 37:34.956
I should be dead.

37:44.028 --> 37:46.427
You know, you shouldn't drink.

37:46.531 --> 37:48.930
It just flat out doesn't agree with you.

37:49.034 --> 37:51.537
You are so right.

37:51.641 --> 37:53.518
You?

37:53.622 --> 37:55.395
Oh, shit.

37:55.499 --> 37:58.941
Oh, well, what do you want from me this time?
I'll do anything.

37:59.045 --> 38:00.401
I know you will.

38:00.505 --> 38:03.842
By the way, your man lost his memory.

38:03.946 --> 38:05.719
Bloody useless.

38:05.823 --> 38:08.117
- He's not my man.
- What?

38:08.222 --> 38:12.184
No. He's a little toerag named Tony Shepherd.

38:13.957 --> 38:16.043
Just tidying up.

38:16.147 --> 38:18.128
He runs a big charity.

38:18.858 --> 38:20.214
I don't trust him.

38:20.944 --> 38:25.428
- But you don't trust me either, do you?
- Oh, just tell me what you want.

38:25.533 --> 38:27.931
I just thought that last night
when you were so upset

38:28.035 --> 38:30.538
that you could maybe use
a little glimmer of hope.

38:30.642 --> 38:34.292
Maybe you could use a little bet.

38:34.396 --> 38:36.378
What?

38:36.482 --> 38:37.942
It's over, it's over. Finito.

38:38.046 --> 38:41.488
Oh, come on, it's never over.

38:42.218 --> 38:45.972
Come on, what have you got to lose?
Look, you could end up winning.

38:46.076 --> 38:48.057
You could save her.

38:50.456 --> 38:52.542
What do you say? First to five souls?

38:53.584 --> 38:55.461
- First to five?
- Yeah.

38:55.566 --> 38:56.921
No tricks?

38:57.026 --> 38:58.694
- No.
- No, no cheating?

38:58.798 --> 38:59.737
No cheating.

38:59.841 --> 39:01.301
I'd say yes. Deal.

39:01.406 --> 39:04.013
God, I love a betting man.

39:04.117 --> 39:06.203
OK, by her birthday, then.

39:06.307 --> 39:08.810
That's in two days, you bastard.

39:08.914 --> 39:11.417
Do you have any idea
what rotten business we're doing?

39:11.521 --> 39:14.232
Things are gonna pick up.
Sure as eggs is eggs.

39:14.337 --> 39:16.526
- Yeah.
- OK.

39:18.299 --> 39:21.741
- First one to five souls wins.
- I'll kill you, you son of a bitch.

39:21.845 --> 39:23.826
Now that I'd like to see.

39:24.556 --> 39:26.538
Wait!

39:29.770 --> 39:31.126
Oh!

39:40.198 --> 39:42.180
Damn phone.

39:46.038 --> 39:48.020
- Morning, Val.
- Hi, George.

39:54.694 --> 39:56.571
Scrumpy?

39:58.135 --> 39:59.074
Scrumpy?

40:00.951 --> 40:02.828
Oh...

40:07.103 --> 40:08.042
Oh.

40:08.146 --> 40:09.710
Good lord.

40:09.815 --> 40:11.275
Good lord.

40:12.526 --> 40:14.403
Food, food. We got food.

40:14.507 --> 40:18.574
We got bread. We got cheese.
We got vegetables.

40:18.679 --> 40:21.390
And we got... this thing.
Whatever this thing is.

40:21.494 --> 40:24.101
It's all your fault we're eating so well today.

40:25.040 --> 40:27.021
Know how to pluck?

40:27.960 --> 40:29.732
Is that... is that... Bertie?

40:29.837 --> 40:32.027
George thought doves would be better.

40:32.131 --> 40:33.487
- Pluck it.
- Pluck it?

40:33.591 --> 40:35.259
- Yeah.
- How?

40:35.364 --> 40:36.198
Here.

40:36.302 --> 40:38.179
That was my best trick.

40:40.056 --> 40:41.412
Five souls in two days, huh?

40:41.516 --> 40:44.436
Put a sock in it. I'm trying to think.

40:45.375 --> 40:48.920
He's been sent to us for a reason. I know it.

40:49.546 --> 40:51.945
- Cards don't lie.
- No?

41:09.464 --> 41:12.384
Pardonnez-moi.
Monsieur Saint George.

41:13.635 --> 41:15.721
Oh, I worry about you.

41:15.825 --> 41:18.328
Not knowing who you are.

41:18.432 --> 41:22.916
It must be extrêmement difficile
pour vous, n'est-ce pas?

41:23.021 --> 41:26.253
Yeah, it really is. It's confusing at times.

41:26.358 --> 41:28.026
- I may be able to help you.
- Really?

41:28.235 --> 41:29.903
Yes. You see this contraption here?

41:30.007 --> 41:31.885
Do the honours, Percy.

41:31.989 --> 41:35.013
Yes.
Now, if you don't mind placing it on your head.

41:35.117 --> 41:37.412
- That's it. Now, you see these wires?
- Yes.

41:37.516 --> 41:40.123
Just hold on to that. That's right.

41:40.227 --> 41:41.687
- All right.
- That's right, now.

41:41.791 --> 41:45.754
Now, I just want you to relax.
And just think of nothing.

41:45.858 --> 41:47.735
That's not gonna be hard considering...

41:47.840 --> 41:49.717
- Shut it!
- I beg your pardon?

41:49.821 --> 41:52.115
Your mouth. Don't breathe.

41:52.324 --> 41:53.888
- Hold your breath.
- Seriously?

41:53.992 --> 41:58.164
Just let the energy flow.
Let it wax and wane.

41:58.268 --> 41:59.936
Think of the earth, the ocean...

42:03.273 --> 42:05.463
That's very good. Very good, very good.

42:06.402 --> 42:08.488
Yes. I need a name.

42:08.592 --> 42:11.095
I need a name. Huh?

42:11.303 --> 42:13.702
Yes, I have a name.

42:13.806 --> 42:14.432
Shepherd.

42:15.579 --> 42:17.560
Anthony Shepherd.

42:17.977 --> 42:19.959
They call you Tony.

42:23.713 --> 42:25.694
That was exhausting.

42:28.405 --> 42:31.847
You used to do good works, I understand.

42:31.951 --> 42:35.809
Erm... something about a charity,

42:35.914 --> 42:37.791
I think.

42:41.024 --> 42:43.422
Yes. Erm...

42:44.256 --> 42:46.238
Tony Shepherd...

42:47.385 --> 42:49.679
It rings a bell for sure.

42:49.783 --> 42:51.973
Wow. This...

42:52.495 --> 42:54.476
This... this... It really works.

42:54.580 --> 42:56.457
You erm...

42:56.562 --> 43:00.941
Is there anything else you discovered
when you were doing your "ums"...?

43:01.046 --> 43:02.401
Well, I mean...

43:02.506 --> 43:04.904
You must understand
this is an ancient technique.

43:05.008 --> 43:08.345
- Right.
- I'm extremely rusty, I'm afraid.

43:10.848 --> 43:13.351
No. There was absolutely nothing else.

43:13.455 --> 43:14.811
No.

43:18.252 --> 43:20.234
Well, it's fascinating stuff.

43:20.338 --> 43:23.675
It really is, I must say.
I mean, can I take this off now?

43:23.779 --> 43:25.656
- Yes.
- Is that all right?

43:25.761 --> 43:29.515
- I mean, thank you very much.
- No, no. Not at all. Not at all.

43:29.619 --> 43:31.496
Bless you. I have a name.

43:31.600 --> 43:33.477
Charity work?

43:33.582 --> 43:34.729
Cool.

43:34.833 --> 43:37.649
So what was he doing
dangling by his neck under the bridge?

43:37.753 --> 43:39.317
Percy!

43:39.422 --> 43:42.029
Is that rude? Did I put my foot in it?

43:43.697 --> 43:47.347
No, it's erm... so strange.
It's horrible, you know?

43:47.451 --> 43:50.058
I just...
Everything is just a complete blank.

43:50.267 --> 43:52.561
You know? But as the good doctor said, I...

43:52.665 --> 43:55.898
I was involved in some sort of charity.
I do remember that.

43:56.002 --> 43:57.879
There you go. Plucked.

43:57.984 --> 44:02.259
I mean, what a fool I must have been,
you know, to think that I could have...

44:02.364 --> 44:04.971
you know, changed the world.

44:05.075 --> 44:08.308
That I could have made a difference.
You know, given people hope, eh?

44:09.246 --> 44:13.105
I mean, what an arrogant idiot I must have...

44:13.209 --> 44:15.503
Hey! What's that?
Can I have a look at that?

44:15.607 --> 44:19.257
- What is that you've got?
- It's Beethoven, Ode To Joy.

44:19.362 --> 44:21.760
No, not the song, mate. The pipe.

44:21.864 --> 44:23.846
- Oh...
- I think it belongs to me.

44:24.784 --> 44:26.766
- Really? You think...?
- Yeah.

44:26.870 --> 44:30.520
How do you... how do you know that?
You remembered you're a musician.

44:30.624 --> 44:33.440
Yeah, it's a day of remembering.
Can I please have it back?

44:33.544 --> 44:34.795
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

44:34.900 --> 44:36.360
You're sure this is yours?

44:36.464 --> 44:38.758
- Positive, mate.
- How can you be sure?

44:38.862 --> 44:41.469
I just know these things.
Can I have it back, please?

44:41.574 --> 44:43.346
Yeah. All right, then. Here you go.

44:46.683 --> 44:48.143
- Er...
- Er...

44:48.248 --> 44:49.603
Yeah.

44:49.708 --> 44:50.959
- Yeah...
- All right.

44:51.063 --> 44:53.670
- I don't know where it's gone.
- It's very funny, isn't it?

44:53.775 --> 44:55.756
Can I have my pipe back?
It means a lot to me.

44:55.860 --> 44:57.946
- Yeah, I understand.
- It's a very special pipe.

44:58.050 --> 45:00.970
I don't quite know...
OK, sorry. Got it, got it. Sorry.

45:01.074 --> 45:02.326
There you go. Take it.

45:02.430 --> 45:04.307
- Sorry, sorry.
- Thanks.

45:05.871 --> 45:08.583
Listen, this isn't funny, mate.
That pipe means a lot to me.

45:08.687 --> 45:10.564
- All right?
- It's a little bit funny.

45:10.668 --> 45:13.067
- No, it's not. Get my pipe back.
- All right.

45:13.171 --> 45:15.152
Let me just look around.

45:15.882 --> 45:17.447
What is it doing in a teapot?

45:17.551 --> 45:19.428
That's what I want to know.

45:19.532 --> 45:21.514
- What is it doing in a teapot?
- I don't know.

45:22.348 --> 45:24.329
- Now, thank you very much.
- OK.

45:24.434 --> 45:27.145
- All right. I'm just mucking about.
- All right.

45:27.249 --> 45:29.648
Right! Now you go fetch that thing.

45:29.752 --> 45:31.525
- No, I'm not kidding. Get that thing.
- OK.

45:31.629 --> 45:33.298
- I'm gonna get it.
- Right now.

45:33.402 --> 45:35.592
All right. Just chill out. Just chill out.

45:35.696 --> 45:36.426
There.

45:37.573 --> 45:39.033
Anton. Enough.

45:39.137 --> 45:41.953
I'm sorry. I'm playing around, trying to bond.

45:42.057 --> 45:43.621
Thanks, darling.

45:43.726 --> 45:45.707
Just trying to bond.

45:48.001 --> 45:49.148
OK.

45:49.253 --> 45:51.651
- That was fun!
- Yeah. Funny, funny.

45:54.154 --> 45:56.970
We'll take this one to the back.

45:57.074 --> 45:59.994
I'm worried about Anton.
What's eating him?

46:00.098 --> 46:02.288
He's in love with Valentina.

46:02.392 --> 46:04.269
In love? Who gave him permission?

46:04.478 --> 46:06.564
- It happens.
- The little snake.

46:06.668 --> 46:11.882
Take him from the streets
and that's the thanks I get. I'll skin him alive.

46:11.986 --> 46:14.072
While you're at it, there's the other one.

46:14.176 --> 46:16.157
- The other one?
- The rattlesnake.

46:16.262 --> 46:18.556
- The forgetful cobra.
- Oh, Tony?

46:18.660 --> 46:21.476
- Tony's another kettle of fish.
- Is he?

46:21.580 --> 46:25.230
Yes, he's ambitious, energetic.
A man of destiny.

46:25.334 --> 46:28.463
- And he'll help us win.
- I think he just might.

46:29.506 --> 46:32.947
- Scrumpy sees some good in him.
- She's better off with Anton.

46:33.051 --> 46:34.928
Perhaps I should offer her hand

46:35.033 --> 46:38.265
to whoever helps us win
the next five souls.

46:39.725 --> 46:43.479
That's an even worse idea
than all the other bad ones you've had today.

46:43.584 --> 46:47.546
You're not wrong, you're not wrong.
Neither of them is worthy of her.

46:47.755 --> 46:49.632
You're never wrong, are you?

46:49.736 --> 46:52.865
Percy.
What would I do without you?

46:52.969 --> 46:55.472
- Get a midget.
- What?

46:55.576 --> 46:58.287
You know, short fellow.
A little taller than I am.

46:58.392 --> 47:00.895
Short legs, short feet, big head.
Runs kind of funny.

47:00.999 --> 47:02.876
Yes, I know, I know.

47:05.170 --> 47:09.237
Doctor Parnassus...
as old as the universe itself.

47:09.341 --> 47:11.427
- Versed in...
- Ah, evening, smokers.

47:11.531 --> 47:14.660
Hello, hello, hello.
How's your night tonight? Is it good?

47:14.764 --> 47:17.580
Is it all right? Had a few pints?

47:17.684 --> 47:19.561
- Let the mind...
- Is he OK?

47:19.665 --> 47:21.542
...of the great Dr Parnassus...

47:25.297 --> 47:27.799
What are you doing,
sniffing about like that?

47:27.904 --> 47:31.032
We must concentrate tonight.
Everything depends on it.

47:41.877 --> 47:45.840
Let the great mind... of this doctor...

47:45.944 --> 47:48.656
...transport you...

47:50.011 --> 47:52.410
...to the world of your imagination.

47:53.870 --> 47:57.415
You, my dear,
I see having a very special destiny.

47:57.520 --> 48:00.752
Procrastinate no longer,
you stupid ponce.

48:01.795 --> 48:03.047
Procrastinate no longer.

48:03.151 --> 48:05.549
Oh, no, no, no, a singer.
I bet you have the voice...

48:05.654 --> 48:07.844
- Hi there!
...of an angel.

48:07.948 --> 48:11.493
Don't you, now? Now, come on,
trust me, you're gonna love this experience.

48:11.598 --> 48:13.683
Hey, what are you doing?

48:13.788 --> 48:16.395
Taking you to the heart
of your imagination.

48:16.499 --> 48:18.793
Oh, my God. No way.

48:18.897 --> 48:20.879
Trust me, you will not regret this.

48:20.983 --> 48:22.652
- Go for it, Sal.
- Yeah, go for it, Sal.

48:22.756 --> 48:25.989
- Only if she comes too.
- Now you're talking.

48:26.093 --> 48:29.117
- I can't do two at the same time.
- Are you crazy, kid? Go for it.

48:29.221 --> 48:32.246
- Well, I'm not going on my own.
- We'll do it together.

48:32.350 --> 48:35.061
- Together. Good idea.
- Are you crazy?

48:35.165 --> 48:37.981
Two imaginations in there at the same time?

48:39.545 --> 48:41.631
Oh, no, no, no. Ladies, ladies, ladies.

48:41.735 --> 48:43.508
One at a time's fine, you see.

48:43.612 --> 48:46.949
When there are two, the stronger
imagination will overcome the weaker

48:47.054 --> 48:48.826
and you have no idea what might happen.

48:48.931 --> 48:52.685
- That's really stupid.
- One alone is safe. Follow me.

48:52.789 --> 48:54.666
- Enjoy yourselves.
- Let go!

48:55.292 --> 48:57.795
- Wait, Anton. Anton!
- Have no fear.

48:57.899 --> 48:59.672
Put me down!

48:59.776 --> 49:02.070
She doesn't want to do it on her own.

49:02.175 --> 49:05.407
Your friend is about to have
a life-changing experience.

49:05.512 --> 49:07.284
- Put me down!
- Pillock.

49:07.389 --> 49:08.536
- No!
- What are you doing?

49:08.640 --> 49:11.143
We've got a customer.

49:11.247 --> 49:13.854
Oh, here we go!

49:13.958 --> 49:15.314
Dad. Father.

49:15.836 --> 49:17.191
- Ooh!
- Sal!

49:18.234 --> 49:20.632
Sal! Get off me! Sal!

49:24.282 --> 49:25.534
Dave! Dave!

49:25.638 --> 49:28.245
- Don't shoot the messenger.
- Sal's in there!

49:28.349 --> 49:30.331
Get back! Get back!

49:42.949 --> 49:44.305
Wait. Wait!

49:51.917 --> 49:53.690
Tony!

49:58.800 --> 50:00.677
Come here, you!

50:02.658 --> 50:04.118
Get off!

50:07.977 --> 50:09.854
Come back!

50:11.209 --> 50:12.982
Wa-argh!

50:26.226 --> 50:28.103
Hi there.

50:37.593 --> 50:39.574
Ow!

50:40.304 --> 50:41.555
Shit.

50:41.660 --> 50:43.745
What were you thinking?

50:43.850 --> 50:45.831
Look what you've done.

50:47.499 --> 50:49.689
Jesus.

50:49.794 --> 50:51.566
- Leave us alone.
- I'm trying to help.

50:51.671 --> 50:53.444
Get out of here.

50:53.548 --> 50:55.633
- Leave!
- First to five.

50:55.738 --> 50:57.719
First to five.

50:58.866 --> 51:02.516
- First to five. One down. First to five.
- Ssh. It's OK.

51:02.620 --> 51:04.915
Get up. We've gotta keep moving.

51:05.019 --> 51:08.356
- I know. It's all right. It's fixable.
- Look, all the homeless guys.

51:08.460 --> 51:10.859
- They'll eat our food.
- All right. Let's do this.

51:10.963 --> 51:13.674
- Jesus Christ!
- What are you doing?

51:13.779 --> 51:15.551
- I'm helping.
- You made a mess.

51:15.656 --> 51:17.741
- What? I'm...
- Get out of here. Come on.

51:17.846 --> 51:20.453
- Percy, Percy...
- You're not helping. Get up.

51:20.557 --> 51:23.477
- All right, all right. All right! I'm gone.
- Go away.

51:34.426 --> 51:37.138
Why don't you just claim it all on insurance?

51:37.242 --> 51:40.058
- Bugger off!
- All right. I was just asking.

51:43.603 --> 51:46.106
Oh, God.

51:47.983 --> 51:50.173
That was quite an interesting crowd, wasn't it?

51:50.277 --> 51:52.154
Just leave me alone, mate.

51:53.093 --> 51:57.368
Hey, Val is a little worried about you, mate.

51:57.473 --> 52:01.540
And she wanted me to have a little chat
with you about what happened today,

52:01.644 --> 52:04.877
with the young lady behind the mirror.

52:08.631 --> 52:11.238
Erm... What are you suggesting, mate?

52:13.011 --> 52:15.931
Anton, you can tell me, mate.
We all heard her screaming.

52:16.035 --> 52:18.642
I was screaming as well.

52:18.746 --> 52:20.936
- It was terrifying.
- It was terrifying?

52:21.040 --> 52:23.752
- I don't understand.
- Well, you wouldn't, would you?

52:23.856 --> 52:26.359
You haven't been inside the Doctor's mind,
have you?

52:26.463 --> 52:29.487
- No, I haven't.
- No. Yeah, you, you, my friend,

52:29.592 --> 52:31.573
you probably think it's a scam.

52:31.677 --> 52:33.137
Well, ain't it?

52:33.241 --> 52:35.223
Oh, no.

52:36.474 --> 52:38.560
No, it's not.

52:38.664 --> 52:42.418
I wouldn't, I wouldn't...
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

52:43.044 --> 52:44.817
Not in a million years.

52:44.921 --> 52:48.884
Right, so if Dr Parnassus
can really control people's minds,

52:48.988 --> 52:51.074
then why isn't he ruling the world, then?

52:51.178 --> 52:52.534
Hey?

52:52.638 --> 52:56.288
Why bother with this little... sideshow act?

52:56.392 --> 52:59.208
It's not a sideshow.
He don't wanna rule the world.

53:01.710 --> 53:04.630
He wants the world to rule itself.

53:06.612 --> 53:07.863
Yeah.

53:09.427 --> 53:12.034
And what about the mirror? What's that about?

53:12.139 --> 53:14.120
- A bit of hocus-pocus?
- No, mate.

53:14.224 --> 53:16.727
Tony, Tony, Tony, you don't get it, man.

53:18.813 --> 53:20.690
It is...

53:21.628 --> 53:24.757
It's impossible to describe. It's just a mystery.

53:24.861 --> 53:26.217
Yeah.

53:26.321 --> 53:30.492
It's everything. It's you, it's me, it's us.
He holds the universe behind that mirror.

53:30.597 --> 53:33.099
Does "first to five" mean anything to you?

53:38.626 --> 53:40.816
I thought you were supposed to be
the clever one.

53:41.963 --> 53:44.049
It's all over. It's lost.

53:44.779 --> 53:47.803
- Finished. Over.
- Ssh. Don't say that.

53:47.907 --> 53:49.576
It's never over.

53:49.680 --> 53:52.704
You're supposed to be immortal,
remember?

53:53.434 --> 53:55.416
Honestly, it's gonna be OK, Dad.

53:55.520 --> 53:57.501
How can you understand?

53:57.606 --> 53:59.066
Hm?

53:59.170 --> 54:01.151
You're a child.

54:01.256 --> 54:03.133
You've never loved.

54:04.384 --> 54:06.261
Not like I have.

54:08.138 --> 54:10.224
From the moment I looked up...

54:10.954 --> 54:14.291
<i>...and saw her, I was captivated.</i>

54:15.542 --> 54:16.898
<i>A prisoner for life.</i>

54:29.307 --> 54:31.184
<i>I was a thousand years old.</i>

54:32.540 --> 54:34.417
<i>How could I woo her?</i>

54:35.356 --> 54:38.276
<i>How could I ever make her mine?</i>

54:40.153 --> 54:43.698
Percy, you devil!
Let go. You don't understand.

54:43.803 --> 54:45.784
- Don't be a fool.
- Let go.

54:45.888 --> 54:48.495
- You can't die. You're immortal.
- Let go!

54:48.600 --> 54:51.728
You'll just end up broken in an eternity ward.

54:51.832 --> 54:54.127
And I'll end up looking after you...

54:54.231 --> 54:56.525
- Just let go, you little shit.
...forever!

54:59.236 --> 55:01.113
No!

55:03.199 --> 55:07.370
<i>And at times like these,
the Devil was never far away.</i>

55:10.186 --> 55:12.376
Why look so glum, Parny?

55:13.523 --> 55:15.817
Accentuate the positive.

55:16.651 --> 55:20.301
<i>He granted me mortality again...</i>

55:20.406 --> 55:22.700
<i>and youth and new powers.</i>

55:22.804 --> 55:24.785
<i>Greater powers.</i>

55:25.828 --> 55:27.601
<i>And I won her.</i>

55:27.705 --> 55:29.687
<i>I was so in love.</i>

55:30.417 --> 55:32.398
<i>So in love.</i>

55:36.048 --> 55:38.029
<i>But at what price?</i>

55:39.176 --> 55:41.158
<i>What price?</i>

55:45.955 --> 55:47.936
What's up, Doc?

55:51.795 --> 55:53.776
But at what price?

55:53.880 --> 55:55.757
But at what price?

56:06.081 --> 56:08.271
Pick up those rotten apples.

56:09.210 --> 56:11.191
Percy, pick up those rotten apples.

56:11.295 --> 56:13.277
- Ow.
- Sorry.

56:14.319 --> 56:16.405
Thank God it's only cuts and bruises.

56:16.509 --> 56:18.491
- Yeah.
- I thought we'd lost you.

56:18.595 --> 56:20.159
Oh, sweetheart.

56:20.264 --> 56:22.245
What a sweet thing to say.

56:22.349 --> 56:24.226
Oh, look at you.

56:24.331 --> 56:26.416
I've been meaning to ask you
about your father.

56:26.520 --> 56:28.919
He seems to be in a terrible state, you know.

56:29.023 --> 56:31.526
Now, is it a financial thing? Is it money?

56:31.630 --> 56:32.777
I don't know.

56:32.882 --> 56:35.802
Because if it is,
you know I can help out in that area.

56:35.906 --> 56:38.826
- I don't know.
- Or is it the show, perhaps?

56:38.930 --> 56:41.224
I don't care about the show any more.

56:41.329 --> 56:43.206
Or what about the police? Maybe...

56:43.310 --> 56:46.021
Bring on the police. I'm sick of living like this.

56:46.125 --> 56:48.211
Oh, really?

56:48.315 --> 56:52.487
Oh, aren't you a little toughie, eh?

56:52.591 --> 56:54.885
Now, listen, you shouldn't be talking this way.

56:54.989 --> 56:58.848
All right? It's very important
what you're doing. It's family stuff. You know?

56:59.056 --> 57:03.749
Maybe it's just things ought to be done
a little different around here.

57:03.853 --> 57:06.148
What different sort of way do you suggest?

57:06.252 --> 57:08.338
Morning. How was your sleep last night?

57:08.442 --> 57:10.423
You had a nasty bump on your head.

57:10.527 --> 57:12.717
Different? What do you mean?

57:12.822 --> 57:17.514
Well, I've been thinking, sir, that, you know,
it's quite obvious that people...

57:17.619 --> 57:20.121
you know,
not many people are attracted to the show.

57:20.226 --> 57:21.894
Oh, thank you so much.

57:21.999 --> 57:25.648
Well, forgive me, but I have
a couple of solutions to your problem.

57:25.753 --> 57:30.028
I was thinking of changing
the style of the show.

57:30.133 --> 57:34.721
I would change the audience, perhaps.

57:34.825 --> 57:36.598
- Change?
- Yeah.

57:36.702 --> 57:40.039
But in my opinion I'd change both.
You know, that's just me.

57:40.144 --> 57:41.916
- And I'd...
- Change the show?

57:42.021 --> 57:44.523
Who the friggin' hell do you think you are?

57:44.628 --> 57:47.235
Don't be so afraid of change, mate.

57:47.339 --> 57:51.927
The fact of the matter is,
this show, the stage, it's just not...

57:53.075 --> 57:56.099
I don't know what the word is.
It's... But you know, it's not...

57:56.203 --> 57:57.246
Modern?

57:57.350 --> 57:59.019
Modern. Yes.

58:00.166 --> 58:04.024
You see, people want modern.
They want, you know, like... like this.

58:04.128 --> 58:07.153
See. This here is contemporary.
This is what people want.

58:07.257 --> 58:08.821
I know this world. Trust me. All right?

58:08.925 --> 58:11.741
Now, with you and your
mind control thingamajigamy,

58:11.845 --> 58:13.722
we need to meet the public halfway.

58:13.827 --> 58:16.747
You know?
The right public in the right part of town.

58:16.851 --> 58:18.624
- What about the filth?
- What?

58:18.728 --> 58:20.709
- The filth.
- He means the police.

58:20.814 --> 58:23.629
Oh, well, there'll be a better class of filth too.

58:23.733 --> 58:25.611
- That will be the day.
- Yeah. Listen.

58:25.715 --> 58:29.365
The secret is, you know, not to hide.

58:29.469 --> 58:31.346
Be bold. Be colourful.

58:31.450 --> 58:35.934
You know, or actually, you know,
be less colourful, perhaps.

58:36.039 --> 58:39.689
And go places people would
never expect you to be at.

58:39.793 --> 58:42.087
You know? Think.

58:42.921 --> 58:44.903
Sir, you saved my life.

58:45.841 --> 58:48.344
Now let me do something in return for you.

58:49.178 --> 58:50.534
Please.

58:51.681 --> 58:53.662
Would you hold on to that?

58:53.767 --> 58:55.748
Scrumpy.

59:00.754 --> 59:04.195
- You believe in coincidence?
- No, there's no such thing.

59:04.299 --> 59:06.281
Isn't that what you always told me?

59:06.385 --> 59:09.200
- Everything has a reason.
- Yes, that's what I believe.

59:09.305 --> 59:11.390
And the cards. Do you believe in them?

59:11.495 --> 59:14.519
What the hell are you on about, Dad?
Is this some kind of test?

59:14.623 --> 59:18.169
Scrumpy, please,
this is an extremely important day.

59:19.837 --> 59:22.861
Do we gamble on Tony?

59:23.800 --> 59:25.990
I want your opinion. I need your advice.

59:26.094 --> 59:29.118
I don't believe this. You want my opinion?

59:29.223 --> 59:31.830
- Yeah.
- This is the best birthday present ever.

59:31.934 --> 59:34.332
Yes. Gamble. Let's do it.

59:34.437 --> 59:36.418
Yes!

59:37.565 --> 59:39.547
Let's do it!

59:40.485 --> 59:42.258
I love you, Dad.

59:42.362 --> 59:44.448
And the Devil take the hindmost.

59:44.552 --> 59:45.803
- Well, lovely.
- Yeah.

59:45.908 --> 59:47.472
How sweet.

59:47.576 --> 59:48.723
So what do we do now?

59:49.453 --> 59:51.435
Well, let's see.

59:51.539 --> 59:54.146
First off, how much money
do we have to play with?

59:55.606 --> 59:58.526
Cos we're gonna need... all of it.

01:00:02.635 --> 01:00:03.886
Anton!

01:00:04.617 --> 01:00:08.370
What are you doing?
Didn't you do enough damage last night?

01:00:08.475 --> 01:00:10.768
Anton! I'm the one who wants to run away.

01:00:12.021 --> 01:00:15.254
Please, don't spoil my birthday. We need you.

01:00:17.444 --> 01:00:19.321
I need you.

01:00:28.289 --> 01:00:30.271
How much money have you got?

01:00:44.141 --> 01:00:46.122
♪ Ode To Joy

01:00:53.005 --> 01:00:56.446
Look, my dear, did you not read our sign?

01:00:56.551 --> 01:00:59.159
We're here to give, not take, my darling.

01:00:59.262 --> 01:01:04.373
But I can see from your beautiful eyes
that you are a very, very generous lady

01:01:04.477 --> 01:01:06.145
and I applaud you for that.

01:01:06.250 --> 01:01:08.960
Excuse me, but how does this work?

01:01:09.065 --> 01:01:10.942
- What does it cost?
- Cost? No.

01:01:11.047 --> 01:01:13.758
The lmaginarium does not cost a thing.
We're not here for money.

01:01:13.863 --> 01:01:16.470
- How long does it take?
- Well, that depends, my dear.

01:01:16.573 --> 01:01:19.597
- I'm running late.
- Late, late, for a very important date.

01:01:19.702 --> 01:01:22.831
Gosh, I can't tell you how many times
I've heard that in my life.

01:01:23.769 --> 01:01:25.438
Listen, can I ask you a question?

01:01:27.002 --> 01:01:28.670
Do you dream?

01:01:28.775 --> 01:01:33.468
Or should I say,
can you put a price on your dreams?

01:01:33.573 --> 01:01:38.786
Or the dreams of the less fortunate
in this world, huh?

01:01:40.038 --> 01:01:42.019
Is there a price for them?

01:01:42.855 --> 01:01:48.694
Or are you all in despair at your inability
to change what is wrong in this world, huh?

01:01:49.632 --> 01:01:51.510
You see, I had a dream.

01:01:52.447 --> 01:01:54.325
But I too walked away from it.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:56.411
You know, I ignored it.

01:01:56.515 --> 01:01:58.393
I had no time for it.

01:01:59.643 --> 01:02:01.208
Does that sound familiar to you?

01:02:01.312 --> 01:02:02.251
Yes?

01:02:02.355 --> 01:02:03.607
I know, my dear.

01:02:03.711 --> 01:02:08.403
But, you see, ladies and gentlemen,
I was saved by a miracle.

01:02:08.508 --> 01:02:11.115
By Doctor Parnassus.

01:02:11.219 --> 01:02:13.201
He gave me my life back again.

01:02:13.306 --> 01:02:15.912
He gave me a reason to dream.

01:02:16.016 --> 01:02:19.354
He took me to the waterfall of happiness.

01:02:19.457 --> 01:02:21.335
And I was reborn.

01:02:23.943 --> 01:02:29.991
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
I can tell you now, I have been...

01:02:30.095 --> 01:02:33.641
No, I am... purified.

01:02:38.542 --> 01:02:40.211
- I'll go first.
- No, I'm going first!

01:02:40.315 --> 01:02:41.880
No, no, no.

01:02:41.984 --> 01:02:44.487
Ladies, we are actually
solidly booked right now.

01:02:44.590 --> 01:02:45.738
Back off!

01:02:45.842 --> 01:02:49.283
- But we are taking reservations.
- Make a booking. Excuse me.

01:02:49.388 --> 01:02:51.370
Calm down.

01:02:52.099 --> 01:02:54.080
Is that child up for adoption?

01:02:54.185 --> 01:02:55.020
Yes.

01:02:55.124 --> 01:02:59.295
I want to adopt that unfortunate black child.
It shouldn't be working like this.

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:01.381
It should be in school.

01:03:02.111 --> 01:03:05.135
- Who's in charge here?
- You are, my lady.

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:07.012
Don't you touch me.

01:03:07.117 --> 01:03:09.516
Don't be frightened, dear.
Everything's OK, officers.

01:03:09.619 --> 01:03:11.600
My darling, tonight is your night.

01:03:11.705 --> 01:03:13.582
- Do you want to be purified?
- Well, oh...

01:03:13.687 --> 01:03:15.772
This is your time.
Please, out of the way.

01:03:15.876 --> 01:03:17.963
But we queued.
How come she gets to be purified?

01:03:18.066 --> 01:03:19.944
She has been chosen, my dear.

01:03:20.048 --> 01:03:21.926
Come away. Trance, Doctor.

01:03:22.030 --> 01:03:23.489
But I haven't paid a thing.

01:03:23.594 --> 01:03:27.453
You can make a donation
on your way out if you feel the need to.

01:03:27.556 --> 01:03:29.121
Some people do. Most people do.

01:03:29.226 --> 01:03:30.790
And he is in his trance.

01:03:30.894 --> 01:03:34.440
Believe me, my dear,
you are the luckiest lady alive.

01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:36.630
- Now, good luck.
- Ooh.

01:03:39.341 --> 01:03:41.531
Oh, this is exciting. This is fun.

01:03:41.635 --> 01:03:42.991
There are so many temptations.

01:03:43.096 --> 01:03:45.076
Maybe just a peek?

01:03:46.954 --> 01:03:48.831
No, wait, Tony!

01:03:53.628 --> 01:03:55.610
Oh, how gorgeous.

01:03:56.756 --> 01:03:58.842
Golly.

01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:02.909
I say, gorgeous.

01:04:18.031 --> 01:04:19.178
It's me.

01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:30.441
Thank you.

01:04:31.379 --> 01:04:33.048
Who are you, dear?

01:04:37.010 --> 01:04:42.642
Oh, I have always known
that you would look like this.

01:04:44.729 --> 01:04:46.605
I don't even know your name.

01:04:48.170 --> 01:04:50.047
It's Roger.

01:05:00.788 --> 01:05:02.143
No, it's not.

01:05:02.248 --> 01:05:04.647
It's Barry.

01:05:04.751 --> 01:05:06.628
- Barry?
- Yes.

01:05:08.401 --> 01:05:10.174
How dashing.

01:05:10.279 --> 01:05:11.947
Quite.

01:06:34.124 --> 01:06:36.940
Oh, goodness me.

01:06:43.092 --> 01:06:44.970
Just a minute now.

01:06:45.073 --> 01:06:47.055
No, no, just a minute now.

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:51.331
If I'm not mistaken,
I believe you're meant to go alone.

01:06:51.436 --> 01:06:54.251
Why would I want to go there without you,
my darling?

01:06:54.355 --> 01:06:56.650
Well, it's one of the rules.

01:06:56.754 --> 01:07:02.282
One imagination at a time,
free from the influence of another.

01:07:02.385 --> 01:07:03.636
Boring.

01:07:03.741 --> 01:07:07.182
- Don't shoot the messenger, babe.
- I'm not going to shoot the messenger.

01:07:07.286 --> 01:07:09.059
Oh, look, come!

01:07:11.250 --> 01:07:12.397
Another possibility.

01:07:12.501 --> 01:07:13.753
Come. Come, come.

01:07:13.856 --> 01:07:15.422
You must make a choice.

01:07:15.524 --> 01:07:17.820
- Mm.
- Actually, to be quite honest,

01:07:17.923 --> 01:07:20.947
I would strongly recommend this one.

01:07:21.052 --> 01:07:22.200
The gondola.

01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:31.065
Look,

01:07:31.168 --> 01:07:33.045
Rudolph Valentino.

01:07:34.192 --> 01:07:36.069
James Dean.

01:07:36.174 --> 01:07:38.156
Princess Di.

01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:39.720
All these people...

01:07:41.283 --> 01:07:42.953
...they're all dead.

01:07:43.057 --> 01:07:44.933
Yes.

01:07:45.038 --> 01:07:48.479
But... immortal, nevertheless.

01:07:49.835 --> 01:07:53.589
They won't get old, or fat.

01:07:53.694 --> 01:07:57.240
They won't get sick or feeble.

01:07:58.283 --> 01:08:00.681
They are beyond fear

01:08:00.785 --> 01:08:04.435
because they are forever young.

01:08:06.208 --> 01:08:08.190
They are gods.

01:08:09.441 --> 01:08:12.257
And you can join them.

01:08:13.612 --> 01:08:15.594
You are such a wonderful speaker.

01:08:15.698 --> 01:08:16.948
I know.

01:08:17.054 --> 01:08:18.410
Get in the boat.

01:08:19.243 --> 01:08:20.912
Ah, one more thing.

01:08:21.017 --> 01:08:22.894
Look at me.

01:08:22.997 --> 01:08:26.544
This is very, very, very, very important.

01:08:27.483 --> 01:08:31.758
Your sacrifice must be absolutely pure.

01:08:32.801 --> 01:08:38.849
Therefore you will need to relinquish
all your worldly possessions.

01:08:38.953 --> 01:08:41.145
Oh. You mean this?

01:08:41.247 --> 01:08:43.647
Yes. And this.

01:08:46.358 --> 01:08:47.921
Now this one.

01:09:07.319 --> 01:09:09.198
Got it! You're free.

01:09:09.301 --> 01:09:12.221
- You're free.
- Thank you.

01:09:16.913 --> 01:09:18.166
- Bye-bye.
- Ta-ta.

01:09:18.270 --> 01:09:18.895
Bye.

01:09:20.251 --> 01:09:21.086
Bye.

01:09:21.607 --> 01:09:23.693
Prepare to be reborn, darling.

01:09:24.318 --> 01:09:26.300
And remember...

01:09:26.404 --> 01:09:28.282
Nothing's permanent.

01:09:28.385 --> 01:09:30.889
Not even death.

01:09:44.237 --> 01:09:45.384
Shit.

01:09:53.727 --> 01:09:55.500
I um...

01:09:55.604 --> 01:09:57.168
Have you... What if...

01:09:57.273 --> 01:09:58.837
No, it's...

01:09:58.941 --> 01:09:59.776
Oh.

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:02.486
What the hell just happened to me?
How did you do that?

01:10:02.591 --> 01:10:03.947
Oh, it was nothing.

01:10:04.051 --> 01:10:07.283
- Voilà.
- Oh, voilà.

01:10:15.628 --> 01:10:17.608
Oh, oh, oh...

01:10:22.405 --> 01:10:23.552
Oh, thank you.

01:10:23.657 --> 01:10:26.577
That was so beautiful.

01:10:26.682 --> 01:10:27.724
Oh, thank you, madame.

01:10:27.828 --> 01:10:31.478
You have given me the strength to continue.
Bless you.

01:10:31.583 --> 01:10:32.730
What name?

01:10:32.834 --> 01:10:34.815
I'll leave it blank.

01:10:39.405 --> 01:10:40.551
Thank you.

01:10:44.828 --> 01:10:46.287
Madame, you've...

01:10:47.226 --> 01:10:49.206
Take me!

01:10:53.483 --> 01:10:55.047
Voilà.

01:10:59.635 --> 01:11:01.722
Fabulous.

01:11:17.052 --> 01:11:17.886
Oh.

01:11:17.989 --> 01:11:19.241
Oh, thanks.

01:11:29.983 --> 01:11:32.173
One more to go and we're free.

01:12:01.059 --> 01:12:02.311
Whoo!

01:12:19.414 --> 01:12:20.144
Hey!

01:12:20.248 --> 01:12:22.126
Anton!

01:12:22.230 --> 01:12:23.168
Just wait...

01:12:23.272 --> 01:12:24.212
Ooh!

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:30.364
Where are we?

01:12:30.468 --> 01:12:31.720
Where did he go?

01:12:31.824 --> 01:12:33.076
Boss, you speak English.

01:12:33.181 --> 01:12:35.058
Yeah, me too.

01:12:35.161 --> 01:12:36.517
Hi. Hello.

01:12:36.622 --> 01:12:39.332
Today's special. "Reach for the Clouds."

01:12:39.437 --> 01:12:41.209
Discover your true potential.

01:12:41.314 --> 01:12:44.235
You too can become rich, famous, celebrated.

01:12:44.339 --> 01:12:47.049
Using no organic produce or nut-free food,

01:12:47.154 --> 01:12:49.657
discover the power within you.
Market research...

01:12:49.762 --> 01:12:52.160
- There he is!
- Where? Where?

01:12:52.264 --> 01:12:53.933
...only 30, I'm sure...
- After him!

01:12:54.037 --> 01:12:56.436
- I'm sure.
- Relax.

01:12:56.541 --> 01:12:58.000
Smell the flower.

01:12:58.104 --> 01:13:00.086
- Quick, up the ladder!
- After him.

01:13:00.294 --> 01:13:01.024
Quickly.

01:13:04.465 --> 01:13:05.822
Oh!

01:13:05.926 --> 01:13:08.220
<i>Reach for the clouds!</i>

01:13:08.324 --> 01:13:11.140
<i>Come on, achieve your potential.</i>

01:13:11.974 --> 01:13:13.956
<i>It can be you.</i>

01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:16.041
<i>It will be you.</i>

01:13:16.146 --> 01:13:18.961
<i>It is you!</i>

01:13:21.255 --> 01:13:23.237
<i>It will be you!</i>

01:13:24.279 --> 01:13:26.261
<i>It is you!</i>

01:13:33.144 --> 01:13:34.396
Oh...

01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:36.586
Get up there, quickly!

01:13:36.691 --> 01:13:38.567
Quickly!

01:13:48.161 --> 01:13:49.726
You idiots!

01:13:56.504 --> 01:13:57.234
Aaargh!

01:13:59.007 --> 01:14:00.675
Ohhh...

01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:02.552
Waargh!

01:14:08.915 --> 01:14:11.000
Get up! Come on!

01:14:14.858 --> 01:14:16.944
Gregor, get up! Idiots!

01:14:17.048 --> 01:14:19.030
I want him dead!

01:14:59.598 --> 01:15:00.535
Oh...

01:15:02.622 --> 01:15:06.584
It's OK! It's OK, I've got you!
I've got you!

01:15:09.504 --> 01:15:11.381
I've got you!

01:15:34.846 --> 01:15:36.098
Kill him!

01:15:39.434 --> 01:15:41.832
- Give me a chance!
- That's not him!

01:15:41.937 --> 01:15:44.023
I told you that's not him!

01:15:44.962 --> 01:15:46.735
It's not?

01:15:47.777 --> 01:15:49.654
- No, it's not. It's not.
- It has to be.

01:15:49.759 --> 01:15:52.053
The boss is always right.

01:15:52.158 --> 01:15:53.409
No, this has to be!

01:15:53.513 --> 01:15:55.703
Wait, wait, wait!
He was right. It's not me.

01:15:58.727 --> 01:16:00.605
It has to be.

01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:02.691
Look!

01:16:02.794 --> 01:16:05.401
You think you fool us? No way, Jose.

01:16:05.506 --> 01:16:06.862
- No way!
- Stop.

01:16:06.965 --> 01:16:08.009
Listen to me.

01:16:08.113 --> 01:16:09.887
You stole my money.

01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:11.346
I will make you die again.

01:16:11.450 --> 01:16:14.474
This time... forever.

01:16:18.854 --> 01:16:19.897
Hey, hey!

01:16:20.002 --> 01:16:21.878
Hey, hey, hey!

01:16:21.983 --> 01:16:23.129
What are you...?

01:16:23.234 --> 01:16:25.111
Excuse me!

01:16:25.216 --> 01:16:28.345
Would you mind putting him down?

01:16:28.450 --> 01:16:31.265
What do you think you're playing at?
You're in your bedroom now?

01:16:31.369 --> 01:16:33.455
You're playing with soldiers, with toys?

01:16:33.559 --> 01:16:35.646
No, this is a human being!

01:16:35.749 --> 01:16:37.625
Now, he's coming with me!

01:16:38.878 --> 01:16:41.902
Or maybe we can settle this
with some fisticuffs.

01:16:42.006 --> 01:16:43.779
All right? Who's first? You're up.

01:16:43.883 --> 01:16:45.656
All right. Bring it on, man.

01:16:45.761 --> 01:16:47.429
Bring it on. Let's do this.

01:16:47.534 --> 01:16:48.785
Let's do this.

01:16:48.888 --> 01:16:50.766
OK? You first? You first?

01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:52.955
- You first?
- Relax.

01:16:53.060 --> 01:16:55.354
Smell the flower.

01:16:57.128 --> 01:16:58.170
Smell.

01:16:58.275 --> 01:16:59.630
OK.

01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:04.844
Oh, my...

01:17:38.947 --> 01:17:39.989
'Ello, 'ello.

01:17:40.094 --> 01:17:42.388
Hey, boys, channel that violence for the good.

01:17:42.492 --> 01:17:45.934
Come on, join up. Come on, lads.

01:17:46.038 --> 01:17:47.602

Hey, Parny!

01:18:55.283 --> 01:18:58.412
I'm going to Chicago, baby.

01:18:58.517 --> 01:19:00.810
I'm driving a stick.

01:19:13.012 --> 01:19:16.140
Yea-a-a-a-he-a-a-a!

01:19:19.269 --> 01:19:20.625
Ahh.

01:19:33.451 --> 01:19:34.287
Anton!

01:19:34.391 --> 01:19:36.892
Anton...

01:19:36.997 --> 01:19:38.145
Wakey, wakey...

01:19:38.249 --> 01:19:39.396
Wakey, wakey.

01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:40.752
Anton... I need your help.

01:19:40.856 --> 01:19:42.838
- Wakey, wakey. Help me.
- I'm awake.

01:19:42.941 --> 01:19:44.193
- Did you see me?
- Yeah.

01:19:44.297 --> 01:19:45.548
- Did you?
- You were great.

01:19:45.653 --> 01:19:47.843
I climbed the ladder. It was unbelievable.

01:19:47.947 --> 01:19:50.868
I mean, I nearly touched the clouds.
I felt incredible.

01:19:50.971 --> 01:19:53.370
- I've been my true self.
- Who are you?

01:19:54.934 --> 01:19:56.394
It's Tony.

01:19:56.499 --> 01:19:57.437
Tony.

01:19:58.481 --> 01:19:59.315
Tony.

01:19:59.419 --> 01:20:02.234
No, it's not Tony. You're not Tony.
No, it's not Tony.

01:20:02.339 --> 01:20:04.529
Use your imagination. Huh?

01:20:04.947 --> 01:20:06.928
Use your imagination.

01:20:08.179 --> 01:20:10.056
Listen...

01:20:10.995 --> 01:20:12.246
I need your help.

01:20:12.350 --> 01:20:15.270
- Yeah?
- You know Parnassus' mind.

01:20:15.375 --> 01:20:17.147
How do I get back to those ladders?

01:20:17.252 --> 01:20:18.608
Is there a map?

01:20:18.712 --> 01:20:20.171
Hey, hey, hey!

01:20:20.276 --> 01:20:21.319
So you're Tony, right?

01:20:21.424 --> 01:20:25.283
If you're Tony, what's the name of my chicken?

01:20:25.385 --> 01:20:27.367
What?

01:20:27.993 --> 01:20:29.558
Plucked.

01:20:29.661 --> 01:20:32.478
God, you've no idea what it's like to feel,
I mean, like a god.

01:20:32.581 --> 01:20:34.563
My lungs were full of air.

01:20:35.398 --> 01:20:39.153
Who were they? Who were those big
Russian men with the fists in my face?

01:20:39.256 --> 01:20:40.821
- That's not important.
- It is.

01:20:40.924 --> 01:20:43.740
- Getting back to that... full body...
- You stole their money.

01:20:43.845 --> 01:20:46.556
- No, I didn't.
- You stole their money.

01:20:46.661 --> 01:20:48.850
That's what I heard them say,
with my own ears.

01:20:48.954 --> 01:20:51.144
- You're going to believe them, not me?
- I might.

01:20:51.249 --> 01:20:53.857
And what are these?
Explain these marks on your forehead.

01:20:53.961 --> 01:20:56.359
I don't know. Something satanic... Devil...

01:20:56.464 --> 01:20:58.966
Listen, those were irredeemably bad men.

01:20:59.070 --> 01:21:00.948
Hm?

01:21:01.052 --> 01:21:03.034
OK? And I'm essentially good.

01:21:05.432 --> 01:21:08.769
Oh, sorry, Tony's trying to be, what,

01:21:09.499 --> 01:21:10.750
- prim?
- Self-righteous.

01:21:10.855 --> 01:21:12.628
- Self-righteous?
- Yes.

01:21:12.731 --> 01:21:14.609
- Well, you want me to be honest?
- Oh, yeah.

01:21:14.713 --> 01:21:16.277
- You want the truth?
- I'd love it.

01:21:16.381 --> 01:21:18.051
- Really?
- Think you can muster it up?

01:21:18.154 --> 01:21:21.075
Do you think you can
get it out of that carcass of yours?

01:21:21.179 --> 01:21:23.577
Just for once. Just for me.

01:21:23.682 --> 01:21:25.350
Eh?

01:21:25.454 --> 01:21:27.853
When I set up my charity, Anton -

01:21:27.958 --> 01:21:29.835
a charity for kids -

01:21:30.877 --> 01:21:35.154
I needed money,
and I accepted a loan from those men.

01:21:40.158 --> 01:21:42.036
I had no id...

01:21:42.140 --> 01:21:44.539
I didn't know.

01:21:44.644 --> 01:21:47.354
They laundered dirty money
through the charity.

01:21:51.944 --> 01:21:53.925
I know I was stupid.

01:21:54.654 --> 01:21:56.636
I made a mistake...

01:21:57.574 --> 01:22:00.286
...and the kids weren't to blame.

01:22:01.538 --> 01:22:03.728
They were the innocents.

01:22:03.832 --> 01:22:05.709
But I...

01:22:05.814 --> 01:22:08.316
I carry that every day.

01:22:08.420 --> 01:22:10.402
Every day of my life.

01:22:15.304 --> 01:22:17.286
All right.

01:22:18.223 --> 01:22:20.831
- You wanted the truth.
- Sorry.

01:22:25.628 --> 01:22:27.609
Are you OK?

01:22:28.548 --> 01:22:30.529
Thank you for that.

01:22:31.050 --> 01:22:33.137
Where are the ladders?

01:22:33.241 --> 01:22:35.118
Will you show me?

01:22:35.952 --> 01:22:37.933
The clouds...

01:22:38.977 --> 01:22:40.541
Nah.

01:22:43.669 --> 01:22:45.129
Anton...

01:22:45.234 --> 01:22:47.111
Hey, mate, don't leave...

01:22:47.214 --> 01:22:49.196
- Ow, ow, ow.
- Don't leave me here.

01:22:49.301 --> 01:22:50.657
Anton!

01:22:50.761 --> 01:22:51.908
Don't leave me. Come on.

01:22:52.011 --> 01:22:53.993
I almost died today.

01:22:55.558 --> 01:22:57.748
Don't leave me. Mate, come on.

01:22:57.852 --> 01:22:58.895
I ju...

01:22:58.999 --> 01:23:00.251
Oh, this...

01:23:00.356 --> 01:23:02.337
I needed the money!

01:23:02.441 --> 01:23:06.507
When you run a charity,
you have to give lots of money away.

01:23:06.612 --> 01:23:08.177
The red tape, the bureauc...

01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:12.139
You have no idea what a bunch of fascists
the Charity Commission is.

01:23:12.661 --> 01:23:15.268
How many more times
does he have to say sorry?

01:23:15.371 --> 01:23:19.126
This is ridiculous. Bring him down.

01:23:19.230 --> 01:23:20.794
Listen, Valentina. Look at me.

01:23:20.899 --> 01:23:25.384
Why can't you see that he has betrayed us
and he has fooled us all? It's so obvious.

01:23:25.487 --> 01:23:27.990
- Open the hatch!
- You're just jealous.

01:23:28.094 --> 01:23:30.493
It's not funny.

01:23:30.598 --> 01:23:32.580
I'm not jealous. I'm not jealous.

01:23:32.683 --> 01:23:34.039
Percy, open the hatch.

01:23:34.143 --> 01:23:37.898
Why would he wanna come down?
He knows we don't like him.

01:23:38.003 --> 01:23:40.609
Come on, you guys. Look at this stuff.

01:23:42.174 --> 01:23:43.947
Have you forgotten how it was before he came?

01:23:44.052 --> 01:23:46.031
No, no, I haven't forgotten, Valentina.

01:23:46.136 --> 01:23:48.847
It was so pure.
Will you please just unzip me here?

01:23:48.952 --> 01:23:50.620
Pure?

01:23:51.663 --> 01:23:54.062
And the women?
You saw their faces when they came out.

01:23:54.167 --> 01:23:55.835
I saw his faces, Valentina.

01:23:55.940 --> 01:23:58.442
I saw both of his faces.
He has at least two. If not more.

01:23:58.547 --> 01:24:01.989
It's my birthday.
Percy, we're supposed to be celebrating.

01:24:04.282 --> 01:24:05.846
At least Tony remembered.

01:24:06.576 --> 01:24:08.662
Would you please listen to me
for one second?

01:24:13.042 --> 01:24:14.503
No.

01:24:14.606 --> 01:24:16.379
Leave it.

01:24:22.115 --> 01:24:24.514
Let him in, it's... Tony?

01:24:24.618 --> 01:24:26.494
No, I think not.

01:24:28.581 --> 01:24:30.458
Sit down.

01:24:39.636 --> 01:24:41.825
Can somebody please answer the door?

01:24:41.930 --> 01:24:44.432
I can't stand not answering the door,
or the telephone.

01:24:44.536 --> 01:24:47.039
Drives me crazy. It's not in my nature.

01:24:47.144 --> 01:24:48.812
I won't be able to sleep.

01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:52.462
The knock-knock-knocking
is gonna be in my head all night.

01:24:52.567 --> 01:24:53.923
Just things like that.

01:25:07.479 --> 01:25:08.419
Well...

01:25:10.087 --> 01:25:11.234
...you've won.

01:25:12.172 --> 01:25:13.632
It's over.

01:25:13.737 --> 01:25:17.178
- Four rotten Russkies?
- And the girl from the pub.

01:25:17.283 --> 01:25:19.472
Ahh, Sal.

01:25:21.559 --> 01:25:23.852
She don't count. Do you, Sal?

01:25:23.957 --> 01:25:26.459
And that's how you take your pleasure,
is it?

01:25:26.564 --> 01:25:28.336
Toying with me?

01:25:28.441 --> 01:25:30.005
Like a cat with a mouse?

01:25:30.109 --> 01:25:33.238
Come on.
Sal didn't get to make a real choice.

01:25:33.342 --> 01:25:36.262
You were out for the count.
It wouldn't be fair.

01:25:36.366 --> 01:25:39.912
You got four...
So, you know, you get your friend Tony.

01:25:40.643 --> 01:25:42.206
Come on.

01:25:43.041 --> 01:25:44.396
We're even.

01:25:45.127 --> 01:25:47.108
It's not quite over.

01:25:49.611 --> 01:25:51.279
Not quite.

01:25:52.323 --> 01:25:53.991
Ho-ho, look at the time.

01:25:54.095 --> 01:25:55.973
It's almost eleven.

01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:05.357
Dad?

01:26:05.462 --> 01:26:06.922
What?

01:26:07.027 --> 01:26:11.511
Oh. We're going to have to give
another performance.

01:26:11.615 --> 01:26:13.388
Now, quickly.

01:26:13.493 --> 01:26:14.847
Er...

01:26:15.787 --> 01:26:17.768
Get ready to move out.

01:26:17.871 --> 01:26:20.062
- Who was that?
- Just somebody asking the way.

01:26:20.167 --> 01:26:22.357
I overheard you. He wasn't asking the way.

01:26:22.461 --> 01:26:24.547
Yes. Tony! Percy!

01:26:24.651 --> 01:26:27.571
- What's going on?
- Not now, Scrumpy, not now.

01:26:27.675 --> 01:26:30.490
- Where's Tony?
- What are you hiding?

01:26:30.595 --> 01:26:35.288
It's to do with that rambling story
you started telling and never finished.

01:26:35.392 --> 01:26:36.748
What are you hiding?

01:26:36.853 --> 01:26:38.104
Oh, you...

01:26:41.545 --> 01:26:43.527
I want to know the truth.

01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:49.262
The truth?

01:26:52.703 --> 01:26:54.476
I am thousands of years old.

01:26:55.416 --> 01:26:57.605
I have been immortal.

01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:00.108
And...

01:27:00.942 --> 01:27:02.924
...I did make a bargain with the Devil.

01:27:04.175 --> 01:27:06.053
For that woman, in the story?

01:27:06.157 --> 01:27:07.616
Yes.

01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:11.893
Your mother.

01:27:17.628 --> 01:27:22.426
I regained my youth and I won her.

01:27:22.529 --> 01:27:24.302
We lived in joy.

01:27:25.032 --> 01:27:27.223
We grew old together.

01:27:27.326 --> 01:27:30.350
And then one day
she came and told me that she was pregnant.

01:27:30.455 --> 01:27:32.541
Imagine.

01:27:32.645 --> 01:27:35.253
60 years old and pregnant.

01:27:35.357 --> 01:27:37.234
It was a miracle.

01:27:38.277 --> 01:27:40.466
But she died giving birth.

01:27:43.595 --> 01:27:44.846
Me?

01:27:44.951 --> 01:27:46.515
Yes.

01:27:48.809 --> 01:27:51.417
Miracle or a mistake?

01:27:51.521 --> 01:27:53.710
You're the best mistake I ever made.

01:27:55.067 --> 01:27:57.465
And the bargain with the Devil?

01:27:58.300 --> 01:28:00.176
There are two parts to a bargain.

01:28:00.281 --> 01:28:02.054
He granted me mortality

01:28:02.158 --> 01:28:09.667
on condition that any child I would father...
would, at the age of 16, belong to him.

01:28:12.065 --> 01:28:13.734
No.

01:28:13.838 --> 01:28:15.819
You're just telling a story.

01:28:16.654 --> 01:28:18.948
A cruel story.

01:28:19.052 --> 01:28:21.451
- Why should I believe it?
- Because it's true.

01:28:21.556 --> 01:28:24.475
Every word of it's true.
But... But there's a new wager.

01:28:24.580 --> 01:28:27.605
All is not lost. Now, we can win, we can win.

01:28:27.708 --> 01:28:29.585
- You'll be mine again.
- Enough, enough!

01:28:29.689 --> 01:28:31.255
- Stop!
- No, listen to me, Scrumpy.

01:28:31.358 --> 01:28:33.131
Listen to yourself!

01:28:33.965 --> 01:28:36.886
Who are you? I don't know any more!

01:28:36.989 --> 01:28:40.014
All my life you've filled my head with dreams.

01:28:40.119 --> 01:28:41.891
Your dreams.

01:28:41.996 --> 01:28:44.185
You're making deals with the Devil.

01:28:45.019 --> 01:28:47.105
What am I?

01:28:47.210 --> 01:28:49.816
A pathetic bet?

01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:51.902
Another mistake?

01:28:53.675 --> 01:28:55.969
- Val!
- Oh, she's gone.

01:28:57.325 --> 01:28:59.829
- She's gone.
- Telling the truth...

01:29:00.662 --> 01:29:02.539
Always a bad idea.

01:29:02.644 --> 01:29:06.920
Oh, hold your tongue, you smug little pustule!

01:29:07.024 --> 01:29:09.319
Get out of my sight and stay out!

01:29:18.287 --> 01:29:22.042
Perhaps you'll find a midget -
if you're lucky.

01:29:26.734 --> 01:29:28.402
Valentina!

01:29:31.844 --> 01:29:33.616
Valentina!

01:29:37.997 --> 01:29:39.665
Valentina!

01:29:42.063 --> 01:29:43.733
Valentina!

01:29:47.070 --> 01:29:48.947
Fuck.

01:29:51.449 --> 01:29:53.118
Come on.

01:29:57.811 --> 01:30:01.357
- What are you doing?
- Trying to save your daughter's life, sir.

01:30:01.462 --> 01:30:02.816
Save?

01:30:02.921 --> 01:30:04.172
How?

01:30:04.277 --> 01:30:06.675
Well, I figured I could be the fifth soul.

01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:09.282
See. I could take that risk, sir.

01:30:09.387 --> 01:30:11.994
You're a good lad, Tony, but it's no use.

01:30:12.098 --> 01:30:13.559
We still have time, don't we?

01:30:13.662 --> 01:30:15.644
Yes, of course there's still time, but...

01:30:15.748 --> 01:30:18.982
You know I'd never ask for anything in return?
It's not in my nature.

01:30:19.085 --> 01:30:23.674
Well, you're a saint, my boy, you're a saint,
but it... it's positively useless.

01:30:23.777 --> 01:30:25.550
Actually, there is one thing.

01:30:25.655 --> 01:30:26.802
Um...

01:30:26.907 --> 01:30:31.391
How about an initiation
into the secrets of the trance?

01:30:31.496 --> 01:30:33.581
- Oh, I can't do that, no.
- What? Why not?

01:30:33.686 --> 01:30:35.458
- No, it won't work.
- I could do it.

01:30:35.563 --> 01:30:37.544
- You'd be a great teacher.
- It hurts my head.

01:30:37.648 --> 01:30:39.526
- What do you mean?
- Too up... Too upset.

01:30:39.630 --> 01:30:42.863
Oh, it's not a time to be upset, sir.
It's time to be happy.

01:30:42.967 --> 01:30:44.636
I mean, think about Valentina.

01:30:44.739 --> 01:30:47.346
Now, we need you to be in a trance
for this to work.

01:30:47.451 --> 01:30:48.808
- Mm.
- Can you give me that?

01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:50.997
- Well...
- Come on. Close your eyes, come on.

01:30:52.769 --> 01:30:55.377
Close your eyes. Think of the ocean.

01:30:55.481 --> 01:30:58.297
The ocean going in and out.

01:30:58.401 --> 01:31:01.217
In and... out.

01:31:01.322 --> 01:31:04.346
Yes, in and... out.

01:31:05.805 --> 01:31:08.725
In and out.

01:31:10.811 --> 01:31:13.001
And in and out.

01:31:20.718 --> 01:31:22.178
Shit!

01:31:23.534 --> 01:31:25.933
I don't have time for this.
Pull yourself together.

01:31:26.036 --> 01:31:27.601
This is not a time to be playing baby.

01:31:27.706 --> 01:31:28.957
- It's no good.
- What isn't?

01:31:29.061 --> 01:31:30.105
It's no good.

01:31:30.208 --> 01:31:31.981
- Now concentrate.
- Won't work.

01:31:32.086 --> 01:31:34.588
Damn it, Tony, just... I need to calm down.

01:31:34.692 --> 01:31:36.256
You need to calm down.

01:31:36.361 --> 01:31:42.410
You just need to relax
and try and um... think of... chocolate.

01:31:42.514 --> 01:31:45.643
Um, melting away on a hot stove.

01:31:45.746 --> 01:31:48.562
It's just melting, melting...

01:31:55.028 --> 01:31:56.592
Good, good, good, good, good.

01:31:56.697 --> 01:31:58.991
Right, stay with me, sir. Stay with me.

01:32:00.973 --> 01:32:03.371
- Oi, what's wrong with you?
- Duty!

01:32:03.475 --> 01:32:05.456
Truth!

01:32:05.561 --> 01:32:06.707
- Oi.
- Justice!

01:32:06.812 --> 01:32:09.003
- Now, what is your problem?
- It's lies.

01:32:09.106 --> 01:32:11.193
Just listen. All right now, calm down.

01:32:11.297 --> 01:32:13.175
Bloody hell, father like daughter.

01:32:13.278 --> 01:32:15.051
- Now come here, look at me.
- No.

01:32:15.155 --> 01:32:16.720
- Calm down.
- No, no.

01:32:16.825 --> 01:32:18.596
- What is wrong? Talk to me.
- Lying...

01:32:18.701 --> 01:32:21.620
- Who's lying?
- I used to think it was precious. It's not.

01:32:21.725 --> 01:32:24.749
What, the lmaginarium?
What are you talking about?

01:32:24.854 --> 01:32:28.088
- I can't even run away.
- You can't even run away from what?

01:32:28.192 --> 01:32:29.860
- You wanna run away from this?
- Yes.

01:32:29.965 --> 01:32:33.301
Listen, if you wanna get away,
I can take you to a beautiful place.

01:32:33.406 --> 01:32:35.699
All right? I can take you somewhere.

01:32:35.804 --> 01:32:39.350
I can get you out of this darkness.
I'll take you to the light, all right?

01:32:39.454 --> 01:32:41.227
I'll take you somewhere beautiful.

01:32:41.331 --> 01:32:43.938
Just you and me. Now trust me.
Come with me now.

01:32:44.043 --> 01:32:46.025
We don't have time for this. All right?

01:32:46.129 --> 01:32:48.214
Now, it's gonna be a paradise, all right?

01:32:48.318 --> 01:32:50.717
It's my world. It could be our world.

01:32:50.821 --> 01:32:52.594
Trust me, it'll be perfect.

01:32:53.949 --> 01:32:56.661
Ah, now. No, see, yeah, that's bad.

01:32:56.766 --> 01:32:59.476
- Did some light reading and found this.
- Can I have a look?

01:32:59.581 --> 01:33:02.084
- Valentina might be interested.
- We don't have time.

01:33:02.189 --> 01:33:04.170
- We gotta get inside.
- He's a liar!

01:33:04.274 --> 01:33:06.881
- He's nothing but a liar, Val.
- This was in the past.

01:33:06.986 --> 01:33:09.176
In the present, I have to get you in there.

01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:11.470
- So come here and trust me...
- Shut up!

01:33:12.721 --> 01:33:14.389
Shut up!

01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:16.788
Val! Valentina!

01:33:16.893 --> 01:33:18.249
No!

01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:21.585
- Aarghh!
- Right.

01:33:22.836 --> 01:33:24.923
I didn't want it to get to this point, mate.

01:33:25.652 --> 01:33:28.781
You don't believe what you read
in the newspapers.

01:33:30.241 --> 01:33:31.597
Especially The Mirror.

01:33:43.381 --> 01:33:45.467
You were right.

01:33:45.571 --> 01:33:47.449
The world is beautiful.

01:33:48.386 --> 01:33:52.036
- Hmm.
- I always dreamed you'd be like this.

01:33:52.141 --> 01:33:54.123
Yeah?

01:33:59.441 --> 01:34:03.300
And er... well, didn't I say you'd be happy here?

01:34:04.238 --> 01:34:06.846
Isn't it just... perfect?

01:34:06.949 --> 01:34:08.305
Perfect.

01:34:09.765 --> 01:34:10.913
Hmm.

01:34:11.018 --> 01:34:13.207
If only we didn't have to make a choice.

01:34:13.311 --> 01:34:15.396
There doesn't have to be a choice.

01:34:15.501 --> 01:34:18.109
Sweetheart, a rule's a rule.

01:34:18.213 --> 01:34:19.777
Those are my father's rules.

01:34:19.882 --> 01:34:21.445
We're free.

01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:24.157
- See?
- Oh.

01:34:24.260 --> 01:34:25.722
- Really?
- Really.

01:34:25.825 --> 01:34:27.494
Hmm.

01:34:27.598 --> 01:34:29.475
Well, er... I suppose you are right.

01:34:30.309 --> 01:34:33.960
Tony, we're free if we want to be.

01:34:35.106 --> 01:34:37.193
Let's just let the river do the choosing.

01:34:38.548 --> 01:34:40.843
Now... kiss me.

01:34:52.940 --> 01:34:55.651
Oh, Val, you're a very naughty girl.

Get married.

01:35:33.715 --> 01:35:36.114
Make babies.

01:35:43.622 --> 01:35:46.960
- Well, maybe this is my, er... choice.
- What d'you mean?

01:35:47.064 --> 01:35:49.671
That's a child. It's not a choice.

01:35:49.776 --> 01:35:51.549
- She needs our help.
- Yes.

01:35:51.652 --> 01:35:54.468
It's OK. It's OK.
Come here, we'll help you.

No, no, it's OK, we're here to help you.

01:35:58.848 --> 01:36:00.517
- Tony, help me. She's strong.
- No!

01:36:00.622 --> 01:36:03.229
Come, it's OK. Honestly, no.

01:36:03.332 --> 01:36:05.419
No, we're friends. Come here.

01:36:07.921 --> 01:36:10.529
Huh?

01:36:11.571 --> 01:36:14.178
- Smile for the cameras, sweetheart.
- Lovely!

The problem in most cases
is you simply can't get there.

01:36:25.755 --> 01:36:30.134
Don't you risk entrenching the need for charity
by institutionalising it?

01:36:30.239 --> 01:36:33.680
It's an unfortunate truism that charity,
like poor little Olga here,

01:36:33.785 --> 01:36:35.766
is always with us, to coin a phrase.

01:36:35.870 --> 01:36:37.851

I think, luckily for the Foundation,
we see eye-to-eye on most things.

01:36:49.218 --> 01:36:51.409

Well done, Tony.

01:40:52.934 --> 01:40:55.229
I can't believe it. After everything.

01:40:55.333 --> 01:40:57.523
- And this is all your doing.
- Yeah, all my doing?

01:40:57.628 --> 01:40:59.505
- How could you, Doc?
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:40:59.609 --> 01:41:04.093
I'm Felicity. I-I mean I'm the falicitator -
the facilitator - dear boy.

01:41:04.197 --> 01:41:07.117
I create the opportunity.
It's not my fault if you're not up to it.

01:41:07.221 --> 01:41:09.516
I'll forgive you.

01:41:19.215 --> 01:41:20.570

01:41:21.405 --> 01:41:23.281
Dad!

Sir? Can...?

01:41:38.925 --> 01:41:41.532
Please, miss. There's n-nothing you can do.

01:41:41.636 --> 01:41:43.826

- No!

01:41:43.930 --> 01:41:46.120
D-D-Dead drunk.

01:41:47.059 --> 01:41:49.561
- Bollocks.
- Haven't we seen this guy before?

01:41:49.666 --> 01:41:52.377
- Oh, they all look the same.
- Aye, bloody drunks.

01:41:56.862 --> 01:41:58.844
I hate you!

01:41:58.948 --> 01:42:01.033
You make me sick!

01:42:12.295 --> 01:42:14.277
This is to be my choice?

01:42:21.577 --> 01:42:25.018
Hold your horses.
There's absolutely no need for that.

01:42:25.123 --> 01:42:27.000
That's just plain contrariness.

01:42:27.105 --> 01:42:30.546
Oh, you really think you deserve punishment,
don't you?

01:42:31.277 --> 01:42:34.718
You have no idea. You're just a kid.

01:42:34.822 --> 01:42:35.655
Huh!

01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:38.368
Where have you been? I'm a woman now.

01:42:38.472 --> 01:42:40.767
Selfish bitch.

01:42:41.704 --> 01:42:45.042
- Only fit for...
- Only fit for Hell.

01:42:47.232 --> 01:42:49.214
If only.

01:42:50.882 --> 01:42:53.490
God, stop. Your pop'd never forgive me.

01:42:54.428 --> 01:42:55.991
That'd be a shame.

01:42:59.537 --> 01:43:00.893
Let's dance.

01:43:44.693 --> 01:43:45.841
Damn.

01:43:47.614 --> 01:43:49.177
I've won.

01:44:16.083 --> 01:44:20.672
You know it's... not exactly
what I had in mind, you know.

01:44:23.071 --> 01:44:24.948
All this.

01:44:25.051 --> 01:44:27.867
I mean, Valentina being the fifth.

01:44:29.223 --> 01:44:33.186
I mean, she's supposed to be the prize,
not part of the final score.

01:44:34.854 --> 01:44:36.836
Just doesn't seem fair.

01:44:39.130 --> 01:44:42.259
I hope they get that bastard
and tear him limb from limb.

01:44:42.362 --> 01:44:44.032
But they won't.

01:44:44.761 --> 01:44:46.743
He leads a charmed life, that one.

01:44:46.848 --> 01:44:48.308
Mm.

01:44:49.350 --> 01:44:51.540
I've been trying to get that bastard
for years.

01:44:51.645 --> 01:44:53.834
I thought I had him this time,
but, you know,

01:44:53.939 --> 01:44:56.963
some prat always seems
to come along and rescue him.

01:44:57.903 --> 01:44:59.257
Aargh!

01:45:00.822 --> 01:45:02.803
You know those er...

01:45:02.907 --> 01:45:06.245
weird markings that he had
on his forehead when you found him?

01:45:07.079 --> 01:45:08.956
What is all that about?

01:45:12.502 --> 01:45:14.379
Do they protect him or... What is it?

01:45:15.631 --> 01:45:18.030
I've never been into
all black magic stuff.

01:45:18.134 --> 01:45:20.114
I just couldn't get the hang of it.

01:45:22.617 --> 01:45:26.581
Can I offer you a stick of gum
or a breath mint?

01:45:28.562 --> 01:45:31.064
Oh, Jesus.
I hate to see you like this, Parny.

01:45:31.169 --> 01:45:32.630
I mean...

01:45:32.733 --> 01:45:34.714
I tell you what.

01:45:34.819 --> 01:45:38.260
If you can get me the lowdown
on all those satanic markings...

01:45:38.364 --> 01:45:42.015
Better, if you can help me wipe
that self-righteous little creep

01:45:42.119 --> 01:45:43.892
off the face of the universe...

01:45:44.623 --> 01:45:46.603
I'll give you Valentina back.

01:45:53.904 --> 01:45:55.885
What do you say?

01:46:01.099 --> 01:46:02.977
Oh!

01:46:03.081 --> 01:46:05.062
Thank God for that.

01:46:14.135 --> 01:46:15.074
Huh?

01:46:16.220 --> 01:46:17.159
Oh...

01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:22.582
Huh? Oh, shit.

01:46:22.687 --> 01:46:24.355
Give it to me.

01:46:24.459 --> 01:46:26.128
Oh, no.

01:46:26.232 --> 01:46:28.109
Look, I'm in a bit of a hurry.

01:46:28.214 --> 01:46:30.820
Now just give us a second, please, everybody.

01:46:33.740 --> 01:46:34.784
Oh!

01:46:34.887 --> 01:46:37.078
Here's your tube and there's mine.

01:46:37.183 --> 01:46:41.458
Mine's a cheap counterfeit, you know.
It breaks so easily.

01:46:43.231 --> 01:46:45.211
Oh, here's another.

01:46:46.047 --> 01:46:46.776
Stop!

01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:48.652
You're not amused?

01:46:48.757 --> 01:46:51.887
You've been talking to the Devil,
haven't you? What did he say?

01:46:51.991 --> 01:46:53.868
No, wait, let me.

01:46:53.972 --> 01:46:57.414
If you manage to kill me,
then he'll release Valentina, right?

01:46:58.770 --> 01:47:00.438
It's all lies. He can't release her.

01:47:00.543 --> 01:47:02.837
He can't release her
cos he doesn't have her.

01:47:02.941 --> 01:47:05.443
He doesn't have her
because she's the prize.

01:47:05.547 --> 01:47:07.425
He still doesn't have the five wins.

01:47:07.529 --> 01:47:09.511
But if you kill me, he will, won't he?

01:47:09.616 --> 01:47:11.805
Then you'll have lost Valentina forever.

01:47:11.910 --> 01:47:12.952
Choose.

01:47:13.057 --> 01:47:15.037
- This is ridiculous!
- Choose!

01:47:15.767 --> 01:47:16.498
Right.

01:47:21.816 --> 01:47:23.067
That one.

01:47:23.172 --> 01:47:25.049
Sure you made the right choice?

01:47:25.154 --> 01:47:27.135
Oh, look...

01:47:28.074 --> 01:47:29.742
Let's find out.

01:47:35.686 --> 01:47:36.938
Voilà.

01:47:47.575 --> 01:47:49.557
Jesus! Spit it out, you old goat.

01:47:55.292 --> 01:47:56.961
Gotcha!

01:48:06.034 --> 01:48:09.058
Thank you all for coming.
It's been a splendid success.

01:48:09.162 --> 01:48:10.621
Uh...

01:48:10.726 --> 01:48:12.499
Round the neck.

01:48:54.422 --> 01:48:56.090
Hey!

01:48:57.133 --> 01:49:00.784
There are three cardinal rules, Mr Nick.

01:49:01.722 --> 01:49:05.789
There is no black magic,
only cheap tricks.

01:49:06.519 --> 01:49:08.501
And I forget the others.

01:49:08.605 --> 01:49:11.212
Now where's my daughter?

01:49:11.317 --> 01:49:13.298
Oh, for Christ's sakes.

01:49:13.402 --> 01:49:15.280
How should I know?

01:49:15.383 --> 01:49:18.304
You're her father.
You're her loving father.

01:49:26.124 --> 01:49:28.002
I mean, she is free, isn't she?

01:49:28.941 --> 01:49:29.774
Jesus.

01:49:45.731 --> 01:49:47.607
<i>And the years roll on.</i>

01:49:49.484 --> 01:49:51.362
<i>Winds still blow.</i>

01:49:52.301 --> 01:49:54.178
<i>Snows still fall.</i>

01:49:54.282 --> 01:49:57.306
<i>Fires... still burn.</i>

01:49:59.288 --> 01:50:01.270
<i>And yet...</i>

01:50:01.373 --> 01:50:03.355
<i>everything has changed.</i>

01:50:05.649 --> 01:50:07.526
<i>Is that my punishment?</i>

01:50:10.446 --> 01:50:12.428
<i>Am I never to find her?</i>

01:50:30.782 --> 01:50:32.763
Please stop.

01:50:33.911 --> 01:50:35.788
No more choices.

01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:38.812
No more choices.

01:52:53.862 --> 01:52:55.844
So you found her?

01:52:55.948 --> 01:52:57.826
Yes.

01:52:58.973 --> 01:53:00.746
Yes, I found her.

01:53:03.039 --> 01:53:04.499
I think...

01:53:05.543 --> 01:53:07.524
...she may have a daughter.

01:53:08.670 --> 01:53:10.548
You're not going in there, are you?

01:53:13.051 --> 01:53:13.990
Er...

01:53:14.824 --> 01:53:17.639
You wouldn't want to scar a child
for life, would you?

01:53:18.891 --> 01:53:20.767
Look at you.

01:53:20.872 --> 01:53:22.854
No.

01:53:24.627 --> 01:53:25.879
Ohh.

01:53:26.816 --> 01:53:28.694
The Great Doctor Parnassus.

01:53:29.632 --> 01:53:31.927
You're an utter disgrace.

01:53:36.202 --> 01:53:37.871
This is gonna take some time.

01:53:37.975 --> 01:53:39.852
Oh, Percy.

01:53:40.999 --> 01:53:42.876
What would I do without you?

01:53:45.275 --> 01:53:47.257
Get a midget.

01:53:48.090 --> 01:53:51.012
Let Doctor Parnassus
open your imagination.

01:53:51.115 --> 01:53:54.348
Transcend heights
on Beauty's open wing

01:53:54.453 --> 01:53:57.477
and be transported to worlds
you've never dreamed of.

01:54:00.293 --> 01:54:02.275
Does it come with a happy ending?

01:54:03.526 --> 01:54:05.507
Sorry, we can't guarantee that.

01:54:12.076 --> 01:54:13.016
Ladies.

01:54:13.953 --> 01:54:15.831
God bless you, son.

01:54:24.904 --> 01:54:26.781
Get back to work.
