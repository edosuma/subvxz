01:10.798 --> 01:15.264
We've got them! Move on!

01:22.054 --> 01:24.223
Let's go friend. Get up.

01:36.837 --> 01:40.574
The Shatrias. Traigon found us!

01:40.575 --> 01:44.593
Krona's house is nearby.
Flee and we'll stop!

01:44.594 --> 01:47.091
Come my lady, over here.

02:04.774 --> 02:07.120
Carefully! Do not hurt the child.

02:08.643 --> 02:10.073
Leave me!

02:21.774 --> 02:26.283
Traigon, butcher! The gods avenge us.

02:26.284 --> 02:30.175
My beloved, even the gods obey me.

02:30.176 --> 02:34.085
Bring me the baby.
The father must see his firstborn.

02:36.976 --> 02:41.861
Beautiful! Kalghara be pleased!

02:41.862 --> 02:44.202
Traigon No, do not kill my baby.

02:44.203 --> 02:48.075
I promised my firstborn to Kalghara.

02:48.076 --> 02:51.764
You know that sacrifice is
necessary for our reign.

03:02.919 --> 03:06.336
For Honor, they're two!

03:06.337 --> 03:09.290
So what is the first?

03:09.291 --> 03:13.907
That's right, you need to know, right?

03:13.908 --> 03:16.396
- Because if you equivocas...
- Do not play with me!

03:16.397 --> 03:18.080
I do not have time for that.

03:18.081 --> 03:20.250
Which? Which?!

03:28.258 --> 03:33.320
Hudra, The claw!

03:36.976 --> 03:41.088
Tell me my beloved.
Or you'll never have another.

03:41.089 --> 03:43.153
The gods will avenge us!

03:48.757 --> 03:51.586
 Crown, Crown!

03:52.855 --> 03:55.084
And she stops talking.

03:55.085 --> 03:57.380
Beast! Criminal!

04:01.013 --> 04:05.501
 Crown, Crown!

04:15.899 --> 04:19.195
Krona, this does not concern you.

04:21.927 --> 04:24.651
Fools! It is disarmed.

04:24.652 --> 04:25.714
 Mátenlo!

04:55.546 --> 05:00.634
Well my old friend.
Age does not affect your ability.

05:00.635 --> 05:05.205
I do not in my arts
trained to murder women.

05:05.206 --> 05:07.837
Never you understood the great values.

05:07.838 --> 05:12.928
Traigon tell me,
which of your three lives take now?

05:12.929 --> 05:17.951
Is it just the first or finally the last?

05:17.952 --> 05:22.342
You are overconfident, my old friend.

05:23.465 --> 05:27.467
It's just an illusion.

05:27.468 --> 05:31.426
You look insecure. You're weakening.

05:32.557 --> 05:33.557
 No!

05:41.344 --> 05:43.323
It was only the first, Krona.

05:43.324 --> 05:47.909
When the moon is in the
House of the Dragon,

05:47.910 --> 05:54.111
I will return, and you're here to...

05:55.554 --> 05:59.208
for my desire.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.017
Take my babies.

06:18.388 --> 06:23.640
Traigon return.
He will return for his firstborn.

06:23.641 --> 06:28.074
I will do it.
They will become great warriors.

06:28.075 --> 06:31.015
And they will take revenge.

06:31.016 --> 06:34.643
They are girls.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.471
Girls.

06:42.662 --> 06:46.325
Jokes with the gods to mortals.

06:51.192 --> 06:59.192
It does not matter. Guerreras be. I said.

07:03.098 --> 07:06.525
From now on, the two shall become one.

07:06.526 --> 07:09.717
Krona share powers.

07:09.718 --> 07:14.617
I grant them the secrets of
wizardry and expertise in battle.

07:52.096 --> 07:53.486
Great Krona.

07:56.177 --> 07:58.773
What brings you on a night like this?

07:58.774 --> 08:00.910
I ask a favor, Dargon.

08:00.911 --> 08:03.946
Whatever, teacher. We owe life.

08:03.947 --> 08:05.830
Since that night when we lost the kingdom.

08:05.831 --> 08:10.933
Take care of these girls as
if they were his daughters.

08:10.934 --> 08:16.958
Of course, I have one,
but I can have three.

08:16.959 --> 08:18.072
Well.

08:18.073 --> 08:22.063
But Dargon, one day men will come,

08:22.064 --> 08:27.235
and seek the two girls, barbaric lineage.

08:28.590 --> 08:31.768
But they look at girls.

08:31.769 --> 08:34.182
No one should know that they are women.

08:34.183 --> 08:35.708
The hide, Krona.

08:35.710 --> 08:37.988
It will be as you want.

09:43.255 --> 09:47.214
Shatrias, my faithful servants.

09:47.215 --> 09:50.833
For 20 years we have
waited for this moment.

09:52.883 --> 09:55.474
The moon is in the House of the Dragon.

09:55.475 --> 09:58.710
And the teacher will be with us once again.

10:00.676 --> 10:02.703
Start.

10:32.623 --> 10:35.951
I love, his faithful servants

10:38.558 --> 10:39.770
greet him.

10:48.055 --> 10:49.179
Master.

10:49.180 --> 10:52.382
His warriors await your orders.

10:53.910 --> 10:59.370
Whoever serves me well
one day govern a nation.

10:59.371 --> 11:03.713
He will command an army
as has ever been seen.

11:03.714 --> 11:10.304
All this will be fulfilled
when invoke Kalghara.

11:12.990 --> 11:17.096
And now, my first order.

11:17.097 --> 11:24.184
Most importantly,
finding the two are as one.

12:30.723 --> 12:32.893
What creature is this?

12:32.894 --> 12:36.657
I do not know, but it seems friendly.

12:37.698 --> 12:40.032
Hey, you want to swim with us?

12:45.273 --> 12:48.799
What's that you have?

12:48.800 --> 12:50.039
Hanging between her legs.

12:50.040 --> 12:52.566
I do not know. A kind of horn?

12:52.567 --> 12:56.716
A weapon? But how I would use.

12:56.717 --> 12:59.428
I do not know and I will
not stay to find out.

13:22.837 --> 13:24.855
Are you sure you want to hurt us?

13:24.856 --> 13:28.831
Dad said not to trust strangers.

13:29.978 --> 13:33.095
Maybe they tell their
friends and come back.

13:33.096 --> 13:34.552
We'd better hurry.

13:56.412 --> 13:58.814
- Soldiers!
- Shatrias!

14:41.004 --> 14:42.969
A sword, Captain!

14:44.215 --> 14:46.881
Rebel, you have an illegal weapon.

14:46.882 --> 14:50.259
I'm not a rebel. I am a simple pastor.

14:50.260 --> 14:52.191
A man has the right to defend his home.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.095
¿Defend it from whom?

14:54.096 --> 14:56.832
Of us? Of the law?

14:56.833 --> 15:00.075
You are not the law.
They are bandits!, criminals!

15:00.076 --> 15:04.297
The punishment for the rebels It's death!

15:09.881 --> 15:11.437
 Alto!

15:11.438 --> 15:13.766
There is something more
important than I look.

15:14.521 --> 15:16.878
You can save your life
miserable, rebellious.

15:18.003 --> 15:19.403
If you bring me the two are as one.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.588
I do not know what you mean, Shatria.

15:25.888 --> 15:28.618
No, the maids are here.

15:28.619 --> 15:29.958
Your you were the hiding!

15:30.722 --> 15:32.402
Bring them now!

15:32.403 --> 15:35.556
I know nothing of maidens,
except for my only daughter.

15:35.557 --> 15:38.773
You should know if your
own man being violated.

15:43.472 --> 15:44.835
My baby!

16:23.709 --> 16:26.898
Need to look at two are as one.

16:29.476 --> 16:32.051
Attack these men, let him die slow!

16:32.052 --> 16:34.135
Let's anyone who hides!

17:05.903 --> 17:06.961
 Mátenlos!

17:42.507 --> 17:44.631
Compas Stop right there! I salute them.

17:47.184 --> 17:50.533
That ability to fight
is worthy of the gods.

17:55.134 --> 17:56.643
I Baldar of Domarn.

17:56.644 --> 17:59.938
In my 56 battles,
I have never seen such skill.

17:59.939 --> 18:01.951
They must have learned from the master.

18:14.349 --> 18:18.029
There is nothing to do, compas.

18:18.890 --> 18:20.854
They travel to heaven.

18:20.855 --> 18:22.255
Were your family?

18:22.256 --> 18:25.380
They were our father, mother and sister.

18:26.677 --> 18:28.725
I'm sorry, compas.

18:28.726 --> 18:31.527
But that Shatria are
looking for two as one.

18:31.528 --> 18:34.645
I think he found them, is not it?

18:34.646 --> 18:37.336
Yes, we are as one.

18:39.114 --> 18:42.711
Do we bury or deliver them to the fire?

18:42.712 --> 18:43.865
The fire.

18:43.866 --> 18:45.363
It is our custom.

18:57.239 --> 18:58.954
Mira, Mara.

19:00.079 --> 19:01.463
Where did you come from?

19:01.464 --> 19:02.918
Who you are?

19:03.420 --> 19:06.592
It was I who gave them their battle skills.

19:06.593 --> 19:07.628
Was you?

19:07.629 --> 19:10.023
Yes, this...

19:10.629 --> 19:12.177
Give me your hand.

19:14.370 --> 19:17.426
So, my powers will pass to you.

19:19.003 --> 19:21.694
By Yggdrasil! This is witchcraft!

19:21.695 --> 19:24.590
- So you're...
- Krona.

19:25.302 --> 19:26.665
Our father told us about you.

19:27.625 --> 19:29.152
He said he would come back someday.

19:29.153 --> 19:32.213
Yes, but I came back very late.

19:33.361 --> 19:36.549
Now all it leads to revenge.

19:36.550 --> 19:39.124
I do not understand, great Krona.

19:39.861 --> 19:43.423
Which caused all this,
Traigon the sorcerer.

19:43.424 --> 19:46.322
He also killed his real mother.

19:46.323 --> 19:52.253
It was to avenge that, and
more, I gave them my powers.

19:53.052 --> 19:56.161
We will master, we will seek to Traigon.

19:56.162 --> 19:57.261
And kill him.

19:57.262 --> 19:59.650
They will face great danger.

19:59.651 --> 20:01.959
We are not afraid.

20:01.960 --> 20:05.055
The powers of illusion.

20:05.056 --> 20:06.576
Delusion?

20:06.577 --> 20:10.108
Normal weapons do not affect him.

20:11.296 --> 20:13.444
They need the name.

20:13.445 --> 20:16.462
The secret name of the Almighty.

20:16.463 --> 20:18.411
It's Ok. Teacher?

20:18.412 --> 20:22.712
When all seems lost, use the name!

20:22.713 --> 20:23.713
Name?

20:25.513 --> 20:29.980
Vitahl. Remember, Vitahl.

20:29.981 --> 20:31.441
- Vitahl.
- Vitahl.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.289
Wait!

20:44.352 --> 20:47.239
I'm leaving, to my destination.

20:47.240 --> 20:51.982
I will join my friends who lost
their lives for giving me his word.

21:23.050 --> 21:26.856
My compas, leave the cries
and avenge these people.

21:26.857 --> 21:28.927
They should find and kill Traigon.

21:29.382 --> 21:32.284
I extend my hand,
join forces and let us help.

21:33.090 --> 21:34.888
Let's get together then.

21:34.889 --> 21:36.848
Fact! My Ragnarök.

23:33.110 --> 23:35.886
He's a thief. He stole the vicar.

23:35.887 --> 23:37.453
They cut their hands.

23:37.454 --> 23:42.478
He is a thief who stole candy vicar's son.

23:43.602 --> 23:46.912
They say it is the law of Traigon.

23:46.913 --> 23:47.913
- Traigon!
- Traigon!

23:57.293 --> 23:58.431
What will happen now?

23:58.432 --> 23:59.667
It beggars again.

23:59.668 --> 24:02.423
And probably better bearing.

24:03.474 --> 24:09.078
Baldar how to find your
friend think so many people?

24:09.079 --> 24:10.619
Where to look.

24:10.620 --> 24:13.963
In every city there is a
place where it is forever.

25:21.895 --> 25:26.855
The Barbarian won again! The bet is mine.

25:33.384 --> 25:36.151
Snakes. Two snakes.

25:41.499 --> 25:43.895
Impossible! He could not win again.

25:43.896 --> 25:45.318
He won three times in a row!

25:46.350 --> 25:48.584
The barbarian is doing something.

25:50.487 --> 25:53.926
Well, barbarian,
you bring forth snakes again?

25:56.283 --> 25:57.643
I will do it.

25:58.383 --> 25:59.483
Snakes.

26:04.875 --> 26:10.468
It is impossible for the goddess of
fortune will smile both barbarian.

26:10.469 --> 26:12.638
Witchcraft! Black magic!

26:15.520 --> 26:17.561
Black magic.

26:20.138 --> 26:23.946
Handsome man like you,
I grant you good fortune.

26:23.947 --> 26:26.947
You'll earn more.

26:28.349 --> 26:30.563
I won enough already. Thank you.

26:30.564 --> 26:32.894
Why do you give to this barbaric dog?

26:34.006 --> 26:37.569
You're a dog, And a son of a bitch!

26:42.976 --> 26:46.973
Do not you barbarian ears?
Do dogs do not speak?

26:46.974 --> 26:50.198
We have heard, and we talked.

26:50.199 --> 26:51.199
Wow, wow!

26:51.816 --> 26:53.887
Mocks you, Hathor.

27:06.367 --> 27:07.367
Wow!

27:08.604 --> 27:12.842
I have to go. I had a good time.

27:13.839 --> 27:16.666
No, leave, those are for men.

27:16.667 --> 27:17.799
No dog.

27:19.676 --> 27:23.151
I'm sorry, do you fall?

27:26.724 --> 27:28.497
Come on you can do it!

27:45.261 --> 27:48.294
He was commissioned. I knew it.

27:57.968 --> 27:59.285
Would you excuse me?

28:01.535 --> 28:03.270
Enjoy it.

28:24.686 --> 28:27.154
Baldar, are you here?

28:29.579 --> 28:32.583
Give thanks to Modin. Bobo boy.

29:37.697 --> 29:39.883
Soldiers! They are Shatrias!

29:41.638 --> 29:44.519
Erlick, friends,
soldiers must not see them.

29:44.520 --> 29:46.459
- Friends?
- Yes.

29:46.460 --> 29:48.895
- Here.
- Compas, hurry.

29:49.653 --> 29:51.045
Faster Faster!

29:51.685 --> 29:53.195
Pando, follow me.

30:07.092 --> 30:09.015
You, what happened here?

30:09.016 --> 30:11.711
Barbarians were four.

30:11.712 --> 30:14.576
And there were two that were as one.

30:14.577 --> 30:17.666
Two were like one?

31:08.315 --> 31:10.125
I can not tell them apart.

31:10.126 --> 31:12.138
- I'm Mara.
- And Mira.

31:13.094 --> 31:16.027
My name Erlick, can be washed here.

31:16.028 --> 31:17.794
Rest if you want.

31:18.842 --> 31:20.751
How did you find me, Baldar?

31:20.752 --> 31:23.977
I have a good nose, boy.

31:23.978 --> 31:26.260
No matter, will not return
to the kingdom of my father.

31:26.873 --> 31:28.430
I do not like war or fighting.

31:29.050 --> 31:31.814
I want to be adventurous. Live Free.

31:31.815 --> 31:35.741
Strange taste wines and exotic lips

31:35.742 --> 31:36.786
of women.

31:38.430 --> 31:40.122
The perfect disguise.

31:40.123 --> 31:42.046
But are girls!

31:43.335 --> 31:44.878
- Girls?
- What are you talking about?

31:48.445 --> 31:50.809
I say they are not men.

31:51.478 --> 31:52.668
We are not?

31:53.453 --> 31:55.631
Are we not men? Are you sure?

31:56.650 --> 31:59.505
You see?, Look I told you
that something was not right.

31:59.506 --> 32:02.853
But it's what Dad told us.
What is the difference?

32:04.189 --> 32:06.808
No... do not you know?

32:06.809 --> 32:08.812
Know what?

32:08.813 --> 32:11.676
The difference.

32:12.622 --> 32:14.219
You do not know what makes us different?

32:14.220 --> 32:16.635
Like those!

32:18.366 --> 32:20.174
How are you?

32:20.175 --> 32:24.261
Yes, but we never found important.

32:28.917 --> 32:31.442
Go to bathe.

32:32.585 --> 32:34.586
We will leave this for later.

32:34.587 --> 32:41.620
Compas, girls are in for a big surprise.

32:43.939 --> 32:46.181
They are under my protection, company.

32:46.182 --> 32:49.069
It seemed to me they
can protect themselves.

32:49.070 --> 32:51.983
Two of them took an oath of vengeance.

32:52.879 --> 32:53.964
Revenge?

32:53.965 --> 32:55.739
Against whom?

32:56.518 --> 32:59.095
- A man named Traigon.
- Traigon?

32:59.096 --> 33:02.098
Do you know him? Where is?

33:02.099 --> 33:04.694
Forget it, Traigon is a sorcerer.

33:05.400 --> 33:06.991
They say it has magical powers.

33:07.642 --> 33:09.266
They are good, but not both.

33:09.267 --> 33:11.127
I swore help.

33:11.812 --> 33:14.480
I do not look, I want a peaceful life.

33:14.481 --> 33:18.280
Mara, Mira,
will be safe here until we return.

33:18.952 --> 33:21.491
Traben the door and not open to anyone.

33:28.257 --> 33:33.169
Mara, what do you think
he meant by "surprise"?

33:33.963 --> 33:37.626
I do not know.
But that Erlick has something.

33:37.627 --> 33:42.171
It gives me a funny feeling
the way he looks at me.

33:47.260 --> 33:51.147
Abran, I'm a friend, Erlick sent me.

33:51.911 --> 33:53.745
Who you are?

33:53.746 --> 33:58.114
They must come.
Erlick was caught by Traigon.

33:58.115 --> 33:59.838
 ¿Traigon?!
-  ¿Traigon?!

34:01.956 --> 34:02.956
We will.

34:03.682 --> 34:05.899
Take us with Traigon.

34:05.900 --> 34:07.394
Follow me soon.

34:40.914 --> 34:46.560
Sean damsels or devils, and have.

34:47.282 --> 34:49.908
A piece of gold for each of you.

34:49.909 --> 34:54.061
And the fury of Traigon for whom miss.

35:00.024 --> 35:05.077
¿Pawned your sword?
The son of King Branwing!

35:05.078 --> 35:06.759
To play craps?!

35:06.760 --> 35:08.860
But I won, Baldar. I won!

35:12.454 --> 35:14.760
Make the most brightness, please.

35:15.330 --> 35:17.056
It was time!

35:17.057 --> 35:19.326
Hugo, púlela.

35:19.327 --> 35:22.596
Look at this, I got it in Babylon.

35:27.711 --> 35:29.197
But this is iron!

35:29.198 --> 35:31.708
It is too brittle to be sharpened.

35:31.709 --> 35:33.870
It is a new method, put on coals,

35:33.871 --> 35:36.060
the hammer again and again,

35:36.061 --> 35:38.854
and while still hot immerse in cold water.

35:38.855 --> 35:40.901
I'll show you, give me that.

35:43.763 --> 35:48.171
With a metal case, a man worth 10 enemies.

35:49.209 --> 35:51.128
Until his enemies also have it.

35:51.129 --> 35:55.314
You always have to object to new ideas.

35:55.315 --> 35:57.481
Watch this.

36:06.134 --> 36:07.713
What this stupid beast say?

36:09.223 --> 36:12.267
The maids are in trouble.

36:13.074 --> 36:16.259
I swore help, are you with me boy?

36:27.541 --> 36:30.384
Hey, that's enough. Give me my sword.

37:25.813 --> 37:28.771
We are ready for the
test, Princess Delissia.

37:28.772 --> 37:32.748
So these are the two that are like?

37:32.749 --> 37:35.822
They possess the magic of an unknown god.

37:36.684 --> 37:39.406
Check this on the fire, for testing.

38:06.333 --> 38:09.700
Now, for the last time,

38:09.701 --> 38:11.644
What is the eldest?

38:12.397 --> 38:14.961
As we told you we do not know.

38:15.939 --> 38:21.159
Then the god Agni will reveal.

38:57.135 --> 39:00.368
Fire recognizes the firstborn.

39:02.316 --> 39:05.266
Agni has revealed the truth.

39:09.015 --> 39:11.062
The twins have returned.

40:06.608 --> 40:08.830
Barbarians fools!

40:11.915 --> 40:13.520
They go to hell for this!

40:14.568 --> 40:16.942
Horses! Horses!

40:37.043 --> 40:38.612
Hunnu.

40:41.571 --> 40:44.977
The high barbarian, find out who he is.

40:46.333 --> 40:47.590
And where it comes from.

40:56.862 --> 41:03.078
Baldar, wait. That's the Forbidden Forest.

41:03.079 --> 41:05.775
Nobody gets out alive from there.

41:06.613 --> 41:09.410
All right. So the Shatrias
will be afraid to follow us.

41:10.300 --> 41:13.129
Yes, but we do not count on it.

41:29.284 --> 41:31.311
The Forbidden Forest had to go.

41:31.312 --> 41:35.102
The planets aligned again in months.

41:35.634 --> 41:38.495
They will not survive for so long.

41:38.496 --> 41:41.732
We must find them, now!

41:41.733 --> 41:46.359
If I can bring anyone you
want, what would be my reward?

41:46.360 --> 41:49.391
I've already promised
to rule the world to me.

41:49.392 --> 41:51.409
What more could you want?

41:52.350 --> 41:55.089
Empires were promised long ago.

41:55.090 --> 42:01.351
But a woman has... other desos too.

42:01.352 --> 42:05.389
I can not. I break my vows.

42:06.399 --> 42:07.825
You always say that.

42:09.051 --> 42:11.582
But you try to break
your vows with that one.

42:12.435 --> 42:15.564
And that is also a crime against the gods.

42:15.565 --> 42:17.131
It is not a crime.

42:17.132 --> 42:20.201
It is a sacrifice for the greater good.

42:21.179 --> 42:24.382
Hunnu, would you like a reward?

42:25.179 --> 42:26.552
I thought so.

42:27.526 --> 42:30.155
And if you succeed,
you will have the second

42:30.156 --> 42:31.643
of the two being as one.

42:31.644 --> 42:34.376
For your own pleasure.

42:40.988 --> 42:42.999
You want to explain yourself?

42:44.101 --> 42:47.566
No, tell you. You are wiser than me.

42:48.892 --> 42:50.999
What are you talking about?

42:53.941 --> 42:59.217
Well, Mara, Mira.

43:00.419 --> 43:02.539
Do you know where babies come from?

43:02.540 --> 43:06.269
We went to our father
donated by the master Krona.

43:06.270 --> 43:09.443
You know how babies are born kids?

43:09.444 --> 43:12.022
Of course! But are animals.

43:15.629 --> 43:16.629
What was that?

43:17.315 --> 43:18.315
 Oh no!

43:21.640 --> 43:23.878
What's that sweet smell?

43:25.066 --> 43:27.029
It comes from fruits.

43:27.030 --> 43:29.285
It makes me feel cheerful.

44:29.535 --> 44:32.093
- Here are the barbarians, master.
- Finally.

44:32.094 --> 44:33.509
Oh, Mara.

44:36.544 --> 44:41.708
You look beautiful,
even in those clothes pastor.

44:43.205 --> 44:44.421
Who are you?

44:44.422 --> 44:47.269
I am Traigon.

44:48.137 --> 44:51.414
You, Traigon, you killed my mother!

44:51.415 --> 44:54.653
Is what these barbarians told you?

44:54.654 --> 44:56.901
Did you deny?

44:56.902 --> 44:59.120
Listen, my daughter.

44:59.121 --> 45:01.269
I am your father.

45:01.270 --> 45:03.473
My father?

45:03.474 --> 45:05.318
Then why?

45:05.319 --> 45:07.820
When you explain
everything, you understand.

45:07.821 --> 45:10.716
But now you must know that you are at home.

45:10.717 --> 45:12.980
Where you belong, after so many years.

45:12.981 --> 45:15.768
And they will treat you
like the princess you are.

45:18.810 --> 45:20.536
Take her to her room.

45:23.140 --> 45:24.306
Wait!

45:25.463 --> 45:29.630
If you tell the truth,
then I must ask you something.

45:30.632 --> 45:35.242
This man must be treated with
respect because he's my friend.

45:36.098 --> 45:41.630
If it has helped you, my daughter,
we will treat it as it deserves.

45:42.686 --> 45:44.933
Ishmar te protegerá, Erlickas.

45:45.693 --> 45:47.565
I know it will.

45:51.228 --> 45:54.482
- Traigon, high barbarian...
- What?

45:55.138 --> 45:59.587
About the barbarian master.
We have found this.

45:59.588 --> 46:01.315
What is that? Dices?

46:01.316 --> 46:03.748
Yes my master, they are loaded.

46:03.749 --> 46:05.628
Observe.

46:14.341 --> 46:16.845
I see. Good work, Khrakannon.

46:16.846 --> 46:21.184
Barbaro, the penalty for
cheating in the game is...

46:21.185 --> 46:23.540
death by impalement.

46:24.609 --> 46:26.534
Death is only death, pig!

46:30.710 --> 46:33.020
Enough!, Take him.

46:38.327 --> 46:40.253
You get angry very easily, Khrakannon.

46:40.254 --> 46:42.987
I want to stab myself stake.

47:03.507 --> 47:07.882
Wait a second, we can discuss it.

47:07.883 --> 47:09.219
Hey Traigon!

47:09.220 --> 47:14.560
I do not enjoy this, young man.
But I must give an example.

47:14.561 --> 47:19.530
Traigon Hey, I'm sorry if I said
something offensive earlier.

47:19.531 --> 47:22.190
I talk man to man.

47:22.191 --> 47:23.864
Let me die standing!

47:23.865 --> 47:25.877
As a warrior.

47:25.878 --> 47:29.579
Why, dog? Death is only death.

47:29.580 --> 47:32.486
I'm sorry, I abhor!

47:33.827 --> 47:37.496
And I understood my mistake,
you do not have to stick me!

47:55.289 --> 47:57.849
Tall! Wait.

47:57.850 --> 47:59.523
What do you have there?

47:59.524 --> 48:02.709
A medallion Armag Dynasty.

48:02.710 --> 48:03.604
¿ARMAG?

48:03.605 --> 48:05.753
Let me see it.

48:05.754 --> 48:09.087
Barbaro, where did you get this?

48:09.088 --> 48:11.771
My mother gave it to me.

48:11.772 --> 48:13.319
When I was a kid.

48:13.320 --> 48:15.898
It is the ancestral blood Armag.

48:15.899 --> 48:19.975
If that is true,
the sacrifice will be perfect.

48:19.976 --> 48:23.122
Yes, the maid will have on your body

48:23.123 --> 48:26.494
seed ancestral noble blood.

48:26.495 --> 48:29.686
Yes, Armag, I'm!, the dynasty of my father.

48:29.687 --> 48:34.412
Now you mind getting on before slipping me?

48:36.789 --> 48:38.055
And!

48:39.434 --> 48:41.182
Libéralo Khrakannon.

48:42.386 --> 48:45.398
Leave the stake in place.

48:45.399 --> 48:47.333
For after slaughter.

49:01.532 --> 49:02.905
We can never cross.

49:02.906 --> 49:05.526
No need, we can take that path.

49:05.527 --> 49:07.423
I see a villa.

49:10.054 --> 49:14.242
A type of house, or temple.

49:16.657 --> 49:18.307
You see it?

49:18.308 --> 49:20.625
How do you see it?

49:20.626 --> 49:26.302
So we are Mara and I see and
feel the same as the other.

49:26.303 --> 49:29.091
And what do you see now?

49:29.092 --> 49:31.576
A temple on a hill.

49:31.577 --> 49:34.204
It's this way.

49:44.121 --> 49:47.307
It is soma, nectar of the gods.

49:47.308 --> 49:50.285
Do you see the moonbeam here?

49:50.286 --> 49:54.763
Tomorrow night will mark here.

49:54.764 --> 49:56.849
That will be the time.

49:56.850 --> 49:58.967
A new era will begin on Earth.

49:59.722 --> 50:01.746
And you will be his first avatar.

50:01.747 --> 50:05.434
A goddess,
you will be honored for generations.

50:05.435 --> 50:12.091
Father, with all this talk, I feel dizzy.

50:12.092 --> 50:14.710
You'll understand then.

50:14.711 --> 50:18.427
But for now, trust me, my daughter.

50:19.682 --> 50:20.957
Trust me.

50:22.626 --> 50:26.257
Trust me. Everything will be fine.

50:27.775 --> 50:31.971
I do. You know what is best for me.

50:31.972 --> 50:33.434
And for all.

50:33.435 --> 50:37.074
Yes. To all my children.

50:38.424 --> 50:41.509
Now, go to your rooms.

50:41.510 --> 50:47.483
Your friend will visit you soon.
He's fine, as you requested.

50:47.484 --> 50:50.206
Erlick. Thanks, Dad!

50:57.571 --> 51:00.764
You see Kalghara? As I promised long ago,

51:00.765 --> 51:04.596
You have the firstborn of Traigon.

51:55.693 --> 51:57.094
Like the soma?

51:57.095 --> 51:59.132
It's fabulous. What's wrong with it?

51:59.133 --> 52:01.663
The soma is the nectar of the gods.

52:01.664 --> 52:07.246
A secret that we inherited
from ancient times.

52:08.484 --> 52:11.089
From the golden era.

52:13.241 --> 52:16.760
Of course, the golden age that
Traigon says he wants to bring back.

52:18.107 --> 52:20.169
With him in charge, of course.

52:20.170 --> 52:22.314
I get bored Traigon and magic.

52:22.315 --> 52:25.607
I do not want to rule the
world, not with him.

52:27.504 --> 52:29.738
I understand he continues.

52:29.739 --> 52:34.980
I want a real man next to me.

52:34.981 --> 52:40.966
Someone who can take away your
power to Traigon, and remove it.

52:40.967 --> 52:45.045
But first, the sacrifice
should continue as planned.

52:45.046 --> 52:49.487
You must make love to Mara,
then you must sacrifice.

52:51.647 --> 52:54.507
She awaits you.

52:54.508 --> 52:59.033
Now, she goes with her, Erlick.

52:59.034 --> 53:04.136
After that, the world will be ours.

53:05.366 --> 53:07.428
Our destiny is to rule together.

53:24.254 --> 53:26.999
Like I said, Traigon,

53:27.000 --> 53:29.805
he is like wet clay in my hands.

53:30.963 --> 53:34.221
The typical simple-minded barbarian.

53:34.944 --> 53:37.002
Do not be so modest.

53:37.003 --> 53:41.601
You were very convincing.
Even I could believe it.

53:41.602 --> 53:45.704
The important thing is to do what we want.

53:47.280 --> 53:48.280
And.

53:48.943 --> 53:50.738
I hope so.

53:55.395 --> 53:57.169
 Erlickas!

54:00.743 --> 54:03.691
I thought they could
have treated you badly.

54:04.577 --> 54:07.713
There was a little tense dispute,

54:09.953 --> 54:15.433
but now, for some reason,

54:15.434 --> 54:18.154
You really are you?

54:18.155 --> 54:20.077
Suddenly you became a woman.

54:21.290 --> 54:22.791
Why do you look like?

54:22.792 --> 54:24.878
You really do not know?

54:24.879 --> 54:30.249
I have this feeling in
my gut when I touch you.

54:30.250 --> 54:34.544
I feel there is a
wonderful secret behind it

54:34.545 --> 54:36.614
and you have the key.

54:57.629 --> 55:00.727
What's up girl? A snake?

55:00.728 --> 55:03.373
- What did you see?
- I do not know...

55:04.438 --> 55:06.078
I feel strange.

55:13.861 --> 55:15.097
Where does it hurt?

55:16.187 --> 55:20.068
It does not hurt me, it's...

55:21.921 --> 55:25.101
I am very hot...

55:25.102 --> 55:29.492
It's... it's Mara.

55:29.493 --> 55:30.804
¿Mara?

55:30.805 --> 55:32.819
They do being tortured?

55:34.791 --> 55:37.652
I do not know it...

55:45.131 --> 55:49.056
Do not! They not are tortured.

55:53.606 --> 55:58.597
By the horns... forget it.

55:59.845 --> 56:02.577
Obviously he's in good hands, but who?

56:03.821 --> 56:06.024
It must be Erlick.

56:13.963 --> 56:15.549
Yes, that's Erlick.

56:15.550 --> 56:18.145
That lustful boy.

56:24.752 --> 56:26.275
No... not again!

56:31.663 --> 56:34.078
I am now sure is Erlick.

56:39.453 --> 56:40.777
 Detente!

56:42.526 --> 56:45.627
Get away from her.
It is under my protection.

57:01.766 --> 57:06.087
Let me know when you find the cold river.

57:30.103 --> 57:32.533
- Friendabond!
- What is that?

57:32.534 --> 57:38.152
Friendabond, they told me stories
of this land since childhood.

57:39.015 --> 57:41.268
They say that once was
the center of the world.

57:43.262 --> 57:45.152
Long ago,

57:45.153 --> 57:47.772
judging by how it looks now.

57:47.773 --> 57:50.515
Mara is there.

57:50.516 --> 57:53.379
There are many soldiers there.

57:54.803 --> 57:56.917
We must go as the night cover us.

57:57.819 --> 58:00.629
Ishmara show us the way.

58:07.625 --> 58:11.657
Now what you see, Mara?

58:11.658 --> 58:17.018
I see... a valley.

58:18.448 --> 58:19.789
A ville...

58:20.884 --> 58:22.899
and a temple.

58:24.207 --> 58:26.999
She is coming.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.058
They are coming?

58:30.956 --> 58:34.291
Your friend is a fool, after all.

58:35.795 --> 58:39.341
No fool. Brave.

58:40.517 --> 58:45.188
He does not understand the sacrifice.

58:45.189 --> 58:46.854
It will try to interfere.

58:46.855 --> 58:48.559
Unless you talk to him.

58:48.560 --> 58:51.421
Then we can be helpful.

58:52.439 --> 58:54.886
And she.

58:58.654 --> 59:03.675
Hunnu, my servant,
in the end you will have your reward.

59:50.256 --> 59:52.934
So it was a trap.

59:55.117 --> 59:57.513
Let the dogs come to try my sword!

59:59.303 --> 01:00:01.935
Let's go! Who will be the first to die?

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.973
I am waiting for you!

01:00:11.987 --> 01:00:14.476
 Santo Gungnir!

01:00:15.810 --> 01:00:16.857
They are bewitched.

01:00:16.858 --> 01:00:19.906
Mara, look at me!

01:00:21.445 --> 01:00:25.246
Surrender, barbarian! I have news.

01:00:25.247 --> 01:00:26.493
Never!

01:00:35.318 --> 01:00:41.181
Traigon, Yea these are
the cowards who will help.

01:00:41.182 --> 01:00:42.952
To rule the world!

01:00:42.953 --> 01:00:45.914
Fight me like men.

01:00:45.915 --> 01:00:49.736
No, barbarian. I have my army of warriors

01:00:49.737 --> 01:00:51.804
quality far superior.

01:00:51.805 --> 01:00:53.961
You will know very soon!

01:01:21.771 --> 01:01:25.651
How easy it is to get rid of fools.

01:01:27.166 --> 01:01:29.289
Prepare the sacrifice!

01:01:29.290 --> 01:01:32.577
Soon planets align.

01:01:33.507 --> 01:01:36.228
You've promised the other maid, master!

01:01:36.229 --> 01:01:37.862
He's angry!

01:01:37.863 --> 01:01:39.767
Filthy beast.

01:01:39.768 --> 01:01:42.317
I have no time for your filthy desires.

01:02:52.694 --> 01:02:56.509
Yet we did not lose, my brave friend.

01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:58.410
Still alive.

01:03:01.423 --> 01:03:03.781
What place is this, Baldar?

01:03:07.422 --> 01:03:12.227
Catacombs, the place of ancient warriors.

01:03:16.548 --> 01:03:20.926
This damn arrow! Look, you can remove it?

01:03:25.104 --> 01:03:26.512
The head is serrated.

01:03:45.553 --> 01:03:49.368
We find a way to get out of here.

01:03:49.369 --> 01:03:52.716
Yes, somehow.

01:05:13.983 --> 01:05:17.081
Sacrificial virgins bring.

01:06:03.197 --> 01:06:06.703
The smell of death!

01:06:37.971 --> 01:06:43.908
Wait here while I investigate the way.

01:08:53.134 --> 01:08:56.926
Kalghara, what I have promised you.

01:08:56.928 --> 01:08:59.046
My eldest daughter!

01:08:59.048 --> 01:09:04.478
Devoted with seed having ancestral blood.

01:09:04.479 --> 01:09:07.176
Give me the great power!

01:10:42.670 --> 01:10:45.598
- What are they?
- Sorcery, illusion.

01:10:47.731 --> 01:10:50.040
They can not be real.

01:10:50.041 --> 01:10:53.678
They are very real, Baldar.

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:29.676
Now, my beloved. Quick.

01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:10.927
When all seems lost, use the name, Vitahl.

01:12:10.928 --> 01:12:12.498
Vitahl.

01:12:15.373 --> 01:12:18.172
 Vitahl!
-  Vitahl!

01:12:28.126 --> 01:12:30.654
Vitahl.

01:12:32.599 --> 01:12:33.897
 Vitahl!

01:12:33.898 --> 01:12:35.422
What do you do?

01:12:37.802 --> 01:12:41.119
Fuck that shit, now!

01:12:44.813 --> 01:12:47.527
- You'll ruin everything.
- Stop them.

01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:42.527
I'll give you another almighty!
One princess!

01:13:43.542 --> 01:13:46.354
Take her to it!

01:13:50.342 --> 01:13:53.694
Now, Kalghara.

01:14:36.171 --> 01:14:39.331
Rise up my warriors! Stand up!

01:14:51.675 --> 01:14:54.920
- Erlickas.
- Mara.

01:15:28.923 --> 01:15:30.073
Look.

01:15:34.038 --> 01:15:38.536
Get up, get up!

01:16:46.702 --> 01:16:50.285
They have long been buried, you know?

01:16:50.286 --> 01:16:51.565
Watch out!

01:17:56.535 --> 01:17:58.276
 Pando!

01:18:20.499 --> 01:18:22.450
A horse Khrakannon, presto!

01:18:22.451 --> 01:18:24.039
If I love.

01:18:40.563 --> 01:18:44.360
Khrakannon, you know what your
mother told when you were born?

01:18:44.361 --> 01:18:45.946
Wow, wow!

01:18:47.374 --> 01:18:49.191
Khrakannon not be so...

01:18:53.971 --> 01:18:55.413
wrathful.

01:18:58.140 --> 01:19:01.923
Now let's see what you got, sorcerer.

01:19:02.998 --> 01:19:05.565
With a snake?

01:19:23.629 --> 01:19:25.497
The power of illusion.

01:19:38.744 --> 01:19:40.831
My daughters.

01:20:09.324 --> 01:20:13.618
Well, company, how you reached a non?

01:20:13.619 --> 01:20:20.170
Baldar, forget that these two are as one
