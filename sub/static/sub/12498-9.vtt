WEBVTT

00:01.900 --> 00:05.300
I haven't left the house in six years.
I am the neighborhood weirdo.

00:07.600 --> 00:09.000
Are you okay?

00:10.800 --> 00:12.500
- Rooster!
- What?

00:12.600 --> 00:15.100
I'd like you to see a friend
of mine-- an oncologist.

00:15.100 --> 00:17.300
- That's cancer.
- I'm not afraid anymore.

00:17.400 --> 00:19.700
- We should just move forward.
- I wanna make peace.

00:19.800 --> 00:23.100
- Get me an audience with my daughter.
- He shows up once or twice a year,

00:23.200 --> 00:25.300
full of promises.
Let's give this a shot.

00:25.300 --> 00:28.200
You're not saying you just
came back into Aubrey's life

00:28.200 --> 00:30.000
just to leave it again.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074

00:48.900 --> 00:52.400
"A marked man"?
Aubrey's dad is a marked man.

00:52.500 --> 00:54.500
What does that mean,
"a marked man"?

00:54.500 --> 00:58.900
It means he either pays back some
crazy, vast sum of gambling debts,

00:59.000 --> 01:02.800
or he has to flee the country or
he gets beaten beyond recognition,

01:03.000 --> 01:06.400
and the worst part is that I'm the one
who reunited him with Aubrey.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.300
I don't think that's the worst part.

01:08.300 --> 01:12.500
I mean, "the beaten beyond recognition"
is pretty bad, in fairness.

01:13.100 --> 01:15.000
Nobody said anything
about "beyond recognition."

01:15.000 --> 01:17.700
I actually added that part for
dramatic effect, but the point is,

01:18.200 --> 01:20.100
he gets beaten badly.

01:20.400 --> 01:22.700
- I'm such an idiot.
- Why are you an idiot?

01:22.800 --> 01:25.600
Aubrey was fine without
her father in her life, and then I,

01:26.000 --> 01:29.500
weakened by the very scoundrel
charm that she warned me about,

01:29.600 --> 01:31.700
insisted on bringing them back together.

01:31.900 --> 01:34.800
And now it's Aubrey's fate
to be heartbroken forever.

01:35.600 --> 01:39.300
Fate is not something
you accept, my friend.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.200
It's something you shape.

01:41.300 --> 01:45.500
Take me going to Sully's to find
the amazing woman who saved my life.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.100
To mold my fate,

01:47.200 --> 01:51.300
I-I-I-I could let her disappear
forever, but I'm not going to.

01:51.300 --> 01:55.200
What are the odds of publicly
tripping three different times

01:55.400 --> 01:58.900
in three different locations on one day?

01:59.500 --> 02:02.100
- Hey, sorry I'm late.
- No, you're right on time.

02:02.400 --> 02:05.400
I was just telling Gabe about me
getting my clumsy on last week.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.300
Oh, yeah. Three times in one day.

02:07.400 --> 02:10.000
Your daughter-- she's like
a regular Jerry Lewis movie.

02:10.199 --> 02:12.800
Yeah, a very lovely Jerry Lewis movie.

02:14.300 --> 02:17.200
Six weeks? She only comes
here once every six weeks?

02:17.200 --> 02:19.700
That's how often we get
delivery from Paul Revere beer.

02:20.200 --> 02:21.500
Aw, man.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.700
Next time, fall for
the White Zinfandel guy.

02:23.900 --> 02:25.700
He's here once a week like clockwork.

02:28.500 --> 02:30.400
Rooster, refills?

02:30.700 --> 02:32.900
Can I get one more for Nick, please?

02:34.200 --> 02:35.400
What's up, Owen?

02:36.400 --> 02:39.500
I got a fate that refuses to be molded.

02:42.500 --> 02:44.500
You're glowering at me.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.800
- You lied.
- A little, all right?

02:47.800 --> 02:49.900
I needed something done.
You were the conduit.

02:49.900 --> 02:52.500
- I don't want to be the conduit.
- You're not the conduit now, all right?

02:52.600 --> 02:55.100
- You were the conduit.
- I don't want to have been the conduit.

02:55.200 --> 02:57.200
I appreciate how much
you care for Aubrey, Nick.

02:57.200 --> 02:59.400
- I'm in the middle of a real--
- Hey, hey, you have to...

02:59.500 --> 03:02.500
- You have to tell her, okay?
- Or I don't.

03:03.300 --> 03:04.700
Or you don't...

03:06.600 --> 03:08.400
In which case, I will.

03:10.400 --> 03:12.700
You see, you're glowering again.

03:16.700 --> 03:18.500
- You're home tonight, right, Eddie?
- Oh, yeah.

03:18.500 --> 03:22.500
'cause I'm making my supreme
combat showdown supreme pasta.

03:22.700 --> 03:25.400
- Come again?
- Supreme combat showdown.

03:25.400 --> 03:29.100
It's a "sport."
It's part boxing, part wrestling,

03:29.200 --> 03:31.100
part disgusting. It's on tv.

03:31.300 --> 03:33.900
Phil makes a pasta for it
with a carbonara sauce,

03:34.000 --> 03:35.900
which puts me in a difficult spot.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
He caters an event that
makes my stomach turn.

03:39.200 --> 03:40.800
It's just another saturday night.

03:41.400 --> 03:42.800
Well, I have an idea.

03:43.100 --> 03:46.000
Come out with me and Hannah tonight.
We're doing girls' night out.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.200
Oh, girls' night out? But-- but
Phil's making supreme combat pasta.

03:49.300 --> 03:51.800
- I don't want to intrude if you guys are--
- Are you kidding?

03:51.800 --> 03:53.600
The more the merrier.
We're going to Sully's.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.400
Wait. You work at Sully's.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.700
Why would you go
there for a girls' night out?

03:57.800 --> 04:01.100
Girls' night out is more fun
when the drinks are free.

04:02.100 --> 04:04.500
Okay. I'm in. Yay!

04:05.300 --> 04:09.100
Wow. I don't usually say "yay."
Just clearly, the prospect

04:09.100 --> 04:12.700
of no supreme combat showdown
is beginning to assert itself.

04:15.800 --> 04:16.700
Hello.

04:16.800 --> 04:20.200
Kelly Bernard's boyfriend is coming
home from college for the weekend.

04:20.200 --> 04:22.200
Okay. Is that code for something?

04:22.300 --> 04:24.700
Well, it's code for Kelly Bernard
is the babysitter.

04:24.800 --> 04:27.600
No babysitter equals
no girls' night out.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.700
Not necessarily.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.800
I just called Paul Revere beer,

04:36.900 --> 04:39.700
and they won't give out any information
about their employees.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
Rooster said she only comes to Sully's
once every six weeks to make a delivery.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.700
She works out of the Paul Revere
beer headquarters

04:46.700 --> 04:50.700
located in Cradle Bay,
which is three hours from here.

04:50.800 --> 04:51.800
So...

04:53.200 --> 04:54.700
I guess I'll have to wait.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.600
- Wait?
- Wait.

04:56.700 --> 04:59.900
You wait for the mail.
You wait for the new James Bond picture.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.800
You do not wait for love,

05:01.900 --> 05:04.100
and you do not wait for--
what's her name?

05:05.500 --> 05:08.000
- I-I don't know.
- Well, she needs a name.

05:08.100 --> 05:10.700
- I want to name her.
- Take it away, my dear.

05:12.700 --> 05:14.000
- Sienna.
- Sienna?

05:14.200 --> 05:17.400
- Definitely Sienna.
- You do not wait for Sienna.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.000
I do not!

05:19.400 --> 05:21.700
But, um, what-- what do I do?

05:21.800 --> 05:24.000
- Uh, you go to cradle bay.
- I do?

05:24.100 --> 05:25.900
- Yeah, we do.
- We?

05:26.000 --> 05:29.100
Sure. Don't you want to be
part of this journey of love?

05:29.400 --> 05:30.700
O- okay.

05:31.500 --> 05:32.500
Nick?

05:32.800 --> 05:34.800
Journey of love?

05:39.700 --> 05:41.100
I'm in.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.300
<i>I'm fine, Leslie.</i>

05:48.900 --> 05:51.000
No, I don't need you to go with me.

05:51.400 --> 05:54.300
It's-- it's my first appointment
with the oncologist.

05:54.300 --> 05:56.000
I'm sure I'll be fine.

06:01.900 --> 06:03.400
Talk to you later?

06:03.900 --> 06:05.200
Me, too.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.300
What's up, dadster?

06:10.400 --> 06:12.300
Get what you need, Nicky,
and let's roll.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.000
We're coming back tonight.

06:14.500 --> 06:17.400
- Going on a road trip to Cradle Bay.
- Cradle Bay?

06:18.500 --> 06:20.700
Oh, I love Cradle Bay.

06:20.800 --> 06:22.900
- You do?
- Yeah.

06:23.700 --> 06:28.000
You remember that trip we all took
to Cradle Bay the summer of '92?

06:28.500 --> 06:30.500
That little motel your mother loved?

06:30.700 --> 06:32.200
Octopus's garden.

06:32.400 --> 06:34.200
- Remember that?
- Uh, vaguely.

06:34.300 --> 06:35.400
Oh, it's great.

06:35.500 --> 06:38.400
They had these little plastic squids
attached to the room keys.

06:38.400 --> 06:41.900
There was a clam shack just
nearby and best batter ever.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.700
- And they let you night-swim.
- Nick, we gotta go now.

06:44.800 --> 06:46.000
Okay. Let's go.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.100
- What-- what if Ronnie and I tag along?
- Dad, I can't.

06:49.100 --> 06:52.100
- I got stuff to do.
- What stuff? You don't have stuff.

06:52.100 --> 06:53.900
- You never have stuff.
- I have stuff.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.100
Look, stuff that doesn't involve
sitting in the car with you three.

06:57.200 --> 06:59.200
- Five of us.
- What? Five who?

06:59.300 --> 07:01.200
Aubrey and her dad are coming, too.

07:02.600 --> 07:04.000
Let's go. You in?

07:04.100 --> 07:06.700
Maybe I could shuffle my stuff around.

07:06.900 --> 07:08.500
Come on, Ronnie.

07:15.800 --> 07:18.900
- Gabriel Diaz, Robert Garrett.
- Nice to meet you.

07:19.100 --> 07:21.500
- Likewise.
- Oh, and that's Ronnie.

07:21.700 --> 07:24.100
- Ronnie, how are ya?
- Let's go.

07:24.600 --> 07:26.200
I call shotgun.

07:28.400 --> 07:31.900
I'm not sure what this is all about, but
if you're trying to avoid telling Aubrey...

07:31.900 --> 07:33.400
I'm not trying to avoid anything.

07:33.500 --> 07:36.400
I want to spend the day with
my daughter here, worry-free...

07:36.900 --> 07:38.900
before I have to say good-bye.

07:56.600 --> 08:00.500
- I think the fall would be great.
- The Ridge is so pretty in the fall,

08:01.000 --> 08:03.700
but it can get cold, and I've always
pictured the wedding outside.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.600
I mean, we could do
the spring date, but then--

08:05.800 --> 08:08.700
then we might as well wait until the
summer. But the problem with summer

08:08.800 --> 08:10.700
is that it's the farthest away,

08:10.900 --> 08:13.100
so I don't want Ray to think
I'm reluctant about

08:13.800 --> 08:15.900
starting our lives together.

08:16.300 --> 08:18.900
There's been a little bit of
weirdness about that lately.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.300
It's like he's questioning
my commitment, which...

08:22.100 --> 08:24.300
I mean, I can understand.

08:27.100 --> 08:29.900
- What do you think?
- Whoa!

08:30.000 --> 08:31.300
You look hot.

08:31.500 --> 08:34.500
- You don't think I look like a soldier?
- Like a hot soldier.

08:40.299 --> 08:42.900
Ray knows how much you love him.
If you want a summer wedding,

08:43.000 --> 08:45.500
he'll know it has nothing to do
with how you feel about him.

08:46.100 --> 08:48.400
Go with what you want.

08:48.900 --> 08:50.900
I know, but the only problem's...

08:51.900 --> 08:54.400
- I'm not sure.
- You're not sure?

08:54.500 --> 08:56.700
I mean about the fall or the spring.

08:56.900 --> 08:57.900
Right.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.500
Give me a heart attack,
why don't ya?

09:21.100 --> 09:22.400
She's gone.

09:22.800 --> 09:24.200
It's over.

09:25.700 --> 09:27.100
This was dumb.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.700
What were the chances
she was even gonna be here?

09:34.900 --> 09:36.400
You said brown hair,

09:36.800 --> 09:39.000
little button nose,
twinkly eyes?

09:40.100 --> 09:41.500
Look, look.

09:44.600 --> 09:46.100
Jenny.

09:46.400 --> 09:48.400
- Her name is Jenny.
- Let me see.

09:50.200 --> 09:51.400
Look at that.

09:52.300 --> 09:55.900
She is the most courteous
and prompt of all the employees,

09:56.000 --> 09:58.700
but she still found time
to save my live.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.900
Mission accomplished.

10:02.200 --> 10:03.800
Accomplished?

10:04.100 --> 10:05.900
You have to meet her.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.900
- You have to.
- How? She's not here.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.200
Well, she will be. Once she is...

10:11.400 --> 10:13.000
she's gonna read your note.

10:13.500 --> 10:16.200
- My note?
- Yeah, your thank you note--

10:16.400 --> 10:20.100
"Dear, jenny, I'm the guy.
"I'm the guy whose life you saved.

10:20.300 --> 10:22.000
"I wanted to say thanks.

10:22.100 --> 10:25.500
"You know, perhaps you'd allow me
"to buy you a nice gratitude meal.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.800
Nothing with bones in it, of course."

10:27.900 --> 10:30.400
And then, you know,
"sincerely, Owen."

10:30.500 --> 10:32.600
You don't forget to leave your number.

10:34.400 --> 10:37.300
- What-- what do you think, Nick?
- You should listen to him.

10:37.800 --> 10:41.600
It's like talking about dental floss
to the guy that invented teeth.

10:46.100 --> 10:48.400
Let's fetch a pen.

10:49.100 --> 10:51.300
Make sure that lid's on tight.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.600
Ma, the bugs are dead.

10:53.700 --> 10:57.200
And while dead bugs in the dining
room are leagues better than live ones,

10:57.400 --> 11:01.500
I prefer the time-honored
"no bugs in the dining room" policy.

11:02.600 --> 11:05.200
Are you sure you're cool working on
your project at the guys' house tonight?

11:05.300 --> 11:08.600
Definitely. Eddie's got
"metroid prime 3: Corruption."

11:09.700 --> 11:11.200
It's a video game.

11:12.100 --> 11:15.200
Oh, and I'd put good money on
Phil having "star wars" dvds.

11:17.400 --> 11:20.800
Silence isn't usually the response
I get to "star wars."

11:22.200 --> 11:25.300
Doodie says that when neighborhood
cats wander into Phil's yard,

11:25.400 --> 11:27.100
he steals them and drink their blood

11:27.200 --> 11:30.400
and that he never leaves the house except
at the stroke of midnight on halloween,

11:30.500 --> 11:32.700
and he wears a suit
made of dead men's flesh.

11:33.200 --> 11:35.500
Okay, I know that
you don't believe that.

11:35.600 --> 11:37.200
So none of it's true?

11:37.300 --> 11:39.400
The true part is that Phil
doesn't leave the house.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
- Why not?
- I don't know,

11:42.200 --> 11:45.200
but I'm sure if you asked him,
he would tell you.

11:47.700 --> 11:50.200
Okay. Everybody ready to go?

11:50.600 --> 11:51.800
Now?

11:52.600 --> 11:53.900
It's gonna be dark soon.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.400
Perfect time to use the handy
new invention, dad-- headlights.

11:57.500 --> 12:01.700
Oh, no, I'm-- I'm just saying why do
we wanna drive back to the Ridge now?

12:02.200 --> 12:04.700
- Let's spend the night.
- What for?

12:05.100 --> 12:06.500
Hey, Ronnie-- he's got...

12:06.700 --> 12:08.400
stuff to do, and...

12:09.000 --> 12:11.700
I'm sure Gabe has things
he needs to take care of,

12:12.200 --> 12:14.800
resolve, et cetera.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.300
I think it's a great idea to stay.

12:20.300 --> 12:22.400
We're all together here, right?

12:22.800 --> 12:25.000
- It's like a party.
- We are here...

12:25.100 --> 12:27.000
and it was a long drive.

12:27.800 --> 12:29.000
I'm in.

12:29.200 --> 12:30.400
Me, too.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.000
I got an idea.

12:33.100 --> 12:36.200
We...we'll go to
the octopus's garden,

12:36.200 --> 12:39.600
with the little squid room keys, and--
and-- and-- and we'll have the fried clams.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.400
Best batter ever. Hey.

12:42.300 --> 12:44.600
Maybe we'll go night-swimmin'.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.000
What do you say, Nicky?

12:47.000 --> 12:48.700
I just don't see...

12:48.900 --> 12:50.100
What?

12:50.800 --> 12:52.800
A night in Cradle Bay?

12:58.700 --> 13:00.100
What could be better?

13:00.500 --> 13:02.200
All right. Let's go!

13:06.300 --> 13:08.200
Go put your stuff down, bud.

13:12.400 --> 13:16.900
So, um, it turns out that
he's a little spooked by Phil.

13:18.700 --> 13:19.600
Sam?

13:19.800 --> 13:22.900
By physical Phil, the world's
most harmless human?

13:23.000 --> 13:25.300
Well, to you and me,
but when you're 10--

13:25.500 --> 13:28.700
certain complexities, like not
leaving the house-- it can be

13:28.800 --> 13:30.200
hard to grasp.

13:30.300 --> 13:32.900
Do you remember weird
Mr. Boothby when we were kids?

13:33.300 --> 13:35.800
The guy who made pies out of pigeons?

13:35.800 --> 13:39.500
Exactly. So Phil is Mr. Boothby-esque

13:39.600 --> 13:41.400
in the eyes of the children.

13:42.800 --> 13:45.800
Don't worry.
I'll get this squared away.

13:46.300 --> 13:48.300
Sam Daniels!

13:48.400 --> 13:52.500
I haven't seen you since
you were a wee lad.

13:52.500 --> 13:58.200
And I mean "wee" as
in wee in your diapers.

14:10.500 --> 14:12.500
Man, has this place gone downhill.

14:12.700 --> 14:14.500
Are you sure this is it?

14:14.600 --> 14:15.700
Yeah.

14:15.800 --> 14:17.500
I remember the blue doors and the pool,

14:17.600 --> 14:20.100
and you can plainly see
the octopus's garden sign.

14:20.200 --> 14:21.700
Oh. Right.

14:21.800 --> 14:23.300
Wow, this place is great.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.200
The old places, right?

14:25.200 --> 14:27.300
Nothing compares to the old places.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.200
I hope there are rooms.

14:30.500 --> 14:33.300
Yeah, that shouldn't be a problem.
There's not a car in the lot.

14:33.400 --> 14:35.700
Well, probably a bonfire at the beach.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.100
Maybe a dance.

14:38.600 --> 14:40.700
Everything just falls apart, don't it?

14:41.900 --> 14:43.800
Dad, it's fine, all right?

14:44.000 --> 14:45.500
Everything's gonna be fine.

14:45.800 --> 14:48.900
Well, it kinda reminds me of
a motel in an old movie.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.800
I saw that old movie.
It was called "Psycho."

14:52.300 --> 14:53.800
Got the keys.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.700
- Uh, where's the little squid?
- I asked. No squids.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.700
The squids haven't been
around for a while.

15:02.800 --> 15:05.300
Maybe they all got
made into calamari.

15:18.900 --> 15:20.500
I feel bad for that Ikey.

15:20.600 --> 15:22.900
Imagine waking up one morning
and no one's talking to you.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.800
Which happens, when
you're waking up that morning

15:24.800 --> 15:27.000
with your best friend's
wife snoring beside you.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.600
- There's Rooster.
- I know. Don't make it weird.

15:35.800 --> 15:37.300
Too late.

15:38.600 --> 15:42.900
Did you know there are
over 360,000 species of beetles?

15:43.000 --> 15:44.100
- Yeah.
- Well, I was thinking,

15:44.200 --> 15:46.600
if we made a diagram of
a few of the different kinds,

15:46.700 --> 15:48.800
you could do an overlap
of the common features.

15:48.900 --> 15:51.400
Well, that sounds like
a great idea, doesn't it, Sam?

15:51.500 --> 15:55.400
In fact, why don't I go pick up the
burgers, and you guys can finish up here?

15:56.800 --> 15:58.500
You don't want burgers?

15:58.900 --> 16:00.500
We could get pizza.

16:00.900 --> 16:03.400
I got an in at Ridge pizza.

16:03.900 --> 16:05.700
I'm not hungry.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.800
You should stay here, Eddie.

16:09.600 --> 16:11.000
I mean...

16:18.100 --> 16:21.200
Uh, you know, "supreme combat
showdown" is on upstairs.

16:21.900 --> 16:26.400
So... you guys can take it from here,
and I'll just catch up with you later.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.600
- To old friends.
- To new friends.

16:39.300 --> 16:42.100
To a night with no
"supreme combat," air bands,

16:42.100 --> 16:44.800
or $2 bets to see who can get
from the kitchen to the living room

16:44.900 --> 16:46.800
using the fewest number of steps.

16:47.400 --> 16:50.100
- For real?
- Sadly, yes.

16:50.600 --> 16:52.500
- Who wins?
- Eddie.

16:53.500 --> 16:55.400
It's a real nail-biter, though.

16:55.800 --> 16:58.400
Wow, I needed girls' night
more than I knew.

16:59.900 --> 17:02.700
Compliments of... Brian.

17:02.900 --> 17:07.000
- For me?
- See, I told you-- very hot soldier.

17:12.599 --> 17:15.000
This pool used to be beautiful.

17:15.200 --> 17:18.300
They had these Big umbrellas that
were the colors of candy canes.

17:18.400 --> 17:19.700
I'll bet.

17:21.099 --> 17:23.400
That Nick's a great kid,
though, you know?

17:23.900 --> 17:25.300
He's nothing like me.

17:27.599 --> 17:29.500
Makes him perfect for Aubrey.

17:29.700 --> 17:31.700
You must've done
a couple of things right.

17:32.500 --> 17:36.500
- Aubrey's a Big bowl of sugar.
- I never much got the hang of...

17:37.700 --> 17:39.700
sticking around, you know?

17:41.000 --> 17:43.400
You always had it figured out,
though, huh?

17:45.800 --> 17:47.700
How to be a father?

17:48.800 --> 17:50.400
I-I think I did. Um...

17:54.600 --> 17:58.300
but I want them to know
how to live--  really live.

17:59.400 --> 18:00.800
They know.

18:01.700 --> 18:03.000
Because they're young.

18:04.700 --> 18:06.900
When you're young,
you live like a giant.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.800
As the years pass, you get noticeably...

18:12.200 --> 18:13.800
smaller and...

18:16.200 --> 18:17.800
smaller.

18:19.900 --> 18:21.700
I think the trick is to get out

18:22.400 --> 18:24.800
before you're the size of a pea.

18:33.600 --> 18:36.000
Hannah Jane Daniels?

18:36.200 --> 18:37.500
It's Lucy!

18:37.900 --> 18:41.800
- Lucy Fisher.
- Lucy Fisher? Oh, my god.

18:41.900 --> 18:45.900
God, it is so great to see you.
You look amazing.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.300
How are you more beautiful
now than you were in school?

18:48.800 --> 18:50.200
I don't know.

18:50.300 --> 18:53.600
You guys, this is Lucy Fisher.
We went to high school together.

18:53.700 --> 18:54.900
I remember you.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.600
She used to write for the yearbook and--

18:56.700 --> 19:01.200
the unofficial "historian" for
Knights Ridge high. Class of '98.

19:01.700 --> 19:04.000
I-I write the yearly "newsletter."

19:04.300 --> 19:07.700
- God, I haven't seen you in ages.
- Well I got married, moved to Carver.

19:07.800 --> 19:11.900
I'm just in for the weekend, but
the smell of the Ridge in the spring?

19:12.000 --> 19:14.600
- It so takes me back to high school.
- Yeah.

19:14.700 --> 19:17.000
Speaking of which, I heard the Big news.

19:17.300 --> 19:19.800
Hello! "Newsletter" time!

19:19.800 --> 19:23.200
- Yeah, I'm...
- Nick Garrett is back?

19:26.500 --> 19:28.100
Yes, he is.

19:38.600 --> 19:41.400
And of course everyone expects the traditional senior prank.

19:41.400 --> 19:43.200
Taking the Knights Ridge
knight from the main

19:43.300 --> 19:45.500
case in the lobby and moving
it somewhere else on campus,

19:45.600 --> 19:48.900
like the girls' locker room,
the library, the cafeteria.

19:48.900 --> 19:51.300
And this is a heavy knight, b-t-w, okay?

19:51.400 --> 19:55.400
It has a sword in one hand and this
little Knights Ridge flag in the other.

19:55.400 --> 19:57.100
It's really heavy.

19:57.300 --> 20:02.500
But our year, Hannah and her friends--
Nick, Owen, Eddie Latekka, Philly Farmer--

20:02.500 --> 20:05.500
- they take it another step. Go.
- Yeah, we moved--

20:05.600 --> 20:07.900
we moved the knight
into the main assembly hall

20:08.000 --> 20:10.400
where the entire high
school is gathered.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.000
Sounds like fun times.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.600
They put the knight back,
and the sword's there, too,

20:14.600 --> 20:18.100
but the flag is missing.
And no one knows where it is.

20:18.200 --> 20:20.100
And then, the next morning,

20:20.100 --> 20:23.200
when everyone's all gathered on the hill
where the cool seniors hung out,

20:23.300 --> 20:26.500
there it is.
Planted in the grass and it said,

20:27.300 --> 20:31.000
"N.G. Hearts H.D. always."

20:31.900 --> 20:33.900
I'm dense.
What does that mean?

20:34.000 --> 20:35.900
Nick Garrett hearts Hannah Daniels.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.600
Nick Garrett hearts
Hannah Daniels always.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.300
Hey, whatever happened
to that flag, anyway?

20:41.300 --> 20:43.400
After all, that was the reason
that the administration

20:43.500 --> 20:46.000
padlocked the glass case,
never allowed that prank again.

20:46.100 --> 20:47.500
Yeah, I don't know.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.600
Nick and Hannah--

20:49.800 --> 20:52.400
it does not glimmer
any brighter than that.

20:55.400 --> 20:57.700
So the... the section
on tiger beetles goes here?

20:57.800 --> 20:59.800
Right next to the burying beetles.

21:01.900 --> 21:03.600
Hey, you know what's weird?

21:04.400 --> 21:07.800
In real life, beetles freak me out.

21:07.900 --> 21:11.100
But tonight I learned that ladybugs are
beetles, which is cool, because I'm--

21:11.100 --> 21:13.400
I'm definitely not scared of ladybugs.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.200
My point is, I'm glad I learned that,

21:16.300 --> 21:19.900
'cause it turns out that beetles
are scarier in my head

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
- than they are in real life.
- Maybe that's 'cause they're dead.

21:23.100 --> 21:26.400
Or maybe it's because
I gave 'em a second chance.

21:28.200 --> 21:31.500
Hey, you know who was really good at
science projects when we were in school?

21:31.500 --> 21:33.600
Oh, don't tell me-- Physical Phil?

21:33.700 --> 21:36.200
You know, I know he wanted to
watch that "supreme combat," but

21:36.300 --> 21:38.400
if it's over, maybe
we could ask him to join us.

21:38.500 --> 21:41.500
- Do we have to?
- No, we don't, but

21:41.500 --> 21:44.000
then I guess I could just
stay scared of beetles.

21:45.300 --> 21:49.400
- You see where I'm going with this?
- Yeah, a 9-year-old could figure it out.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.200
Eddie, I'm 10.

21:52.400 --> 21:53.900
Come on.
What do you say?

21:56.800 --> 22:01.900
Okay, but if he has kitty whiskers
in his teeth, I am so outta here.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.100
Gabe Diaz is cool.
The man's a pimp.

22:08.300 --> 22:13.000
- He's, like, out of a novel.
- Yeah, "confessions of a slimeball."

22:13.300 --> 22:16.100
I don't think so.
I think he's colorful.

22:16.100 --> 22:19.400
- What do you know from colorful?
- Colorful's appealing.

22:19.700 --> 22:22.500
- It beats beige.
- Hey, I like beige.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.300
Beige is nice.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.000
Beige is neutral.

22:26.400 --> 22:29.200
Beige doesn't pick up on the coat check
girl and have sex with her in the closet

22:29.300 --> 22:33.100
- during their daughter's dance recital.
- But beige wishes it could.

22:33.200 --> 22:35.700
- Get ready to have your lives changed.
- Yeah!

22:36.300 --> 22:39.600
- Where's Aubrey?
- Oh, she went for a walk with Gabe.

22:40.100 --> 22:43.100
Gather 'roun lads.
The fried clams have landed.

22:46.900 --> 22:48.600
Look at this place.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.900
I love ferris wheels.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.700
Should we take it for a spin?

22:52.700 --> 22:56.900
I think it's died and gone to
amusement park heaven, Gabe.

22:57.300 --> 22:59.500
Let's just take one ride, huh?

22:59.900 --> 23:01.300
It's closed.

23:03.100 --> 23:05.000
Never stopped me before.

23:06.100 --> 23:08.200
Maybe that's the problem.

23:08.400 --> 23:09.800
So...

23:10.900 --> 23:14.500
maybe the problem is we missed
all the open amusement parks,

23:16.000 --> 23:18.100
and we've just got
some catching up to do.

23:24.300 --> 23:25.800
You guys called me?

23:25.900 --> 23:28.200
Hey, man. Hey, um, yeah,
we were just wondering

23:28.300 --> 23:30.800
if maybe you could help us out
with some of the essay part.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.200
Eddie said you were good at science.

23:34.800 --> 23:36.400
I get by.

23:40.400 --> 23:44.600
Hey, I thought I'd at least get a
conversation in return for the drink.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.300
That's very sweet.

23:47.500 --> 23:50.500
But actually, I have a boyfriend.

23:52.900 --> 23:55.900
Do you think your boyfriend would object
to you joining us for a game of darts?

23:56.100 --> 23:57.900
I mean, I'll give you 15 points.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.600
My boyfriend might object to
you thinking I need 15 points.

24:01.800 --> 24:03.800
- Really?
- Yeah.

24:22.300 --> 24:23.600
After you.

24:33.300 --> 24:35.900
- These are good.
- Yeah, delicious.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Get off it.
They're terrible.

24:38.500 --> 24:41.600
Oh, thank god. I thought mine
were the only ones that sucked.

24:41.800 --> 24:43.000
What?

24:43.200 --> 24:45.800
It's not like we're never
gonna eat fried clams again.

24:54.600 --> 24:56.100
You are good.

24:56.100 --> 24:59.000
Looks, talent and skilled
with the feathers.

24:59.300 --> 25:00.900
You're like Robin Hood.

25:01.100 --> 25:03.000
That's what they call me.

25:07.300 --> 25:09.800
Must've been nice to be
cool in high school.

25:10.100 --> 25:13.000
- I wasn't cool in high school.
- Oh, I don't believe that.

25:13.100 --> 25:16.600
Trust me. I was all indie
rock and nose rings,

25:16.600 --> 25:19.900
- Sylvia Plath poems.
- So... you were college cool?

25:20.000 --> 25:24.200
Yep. College cool in high
school-- not cool.

25:31.300 --> 25:33.200
I was cool back then...

25:34.400 --> 25:36.300
and I didn't even know it.

25:38.900 --> 25:40.800
Why is it that when memories
are happening,

25:41.500 --> 25:43.600
you don't know that
they're gonna be memories?

25:43.700 --> 25:46.200
So you don't get to appreciate
them until it's too late?

25:46.300 --> 25:48.700
"Youth is wasted on the young."

25:49.200 --> 25:51.400
George Bernard Shaw said that.

25:51.900 --> 25:53.700
Maybe George Harrison.

25:53.800 --> 25:56.700
The two are often confused.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.400
Nick and Hannah.

26:04.500 --> 26:06.200
Do you think it's true?

26:07.300 --> 26:09.700
That it doesn't glimmer
any brighter than that?

26:10.100 --> 26:11.700
Sure, it does.

26:12.300 --> 26:14.500
It's just a different kind of glimmer.

26:19.500 --> 26:23.800
Now we knowing some beetles,
the ability to fly has been lost.

26:23.800 --> 26:25.600
And all the ground beetles,
like tiger beetles.

26:25.600 --> 26:26.700
Exactly.

26:26.800 --> 26:31.200
- Hey, is, "supreme combat" still on?
- I'm not sure.

26:31.800 --> 26:33.500
I'm just going to, uh...

26:36.800 --> 26:39.200
I can't believe you got
the lights to work.

26:39.500 --> 26:41.900
Ah, it's all about the sleight of hand.

26:44.400 --> 26:47.000
I know sleight of hand
isn't exactly the quality

26:47.100 --> 26:49.500
most little girls are looking
for in a father.

26:49.600 --> 26:51.800
More like reliability...

26:52.000 --> 26:53.700
security...

26:54.100 --> 26:57.800
physical presence,
an ability to keep their mitts off

26:57.900 --> 27:00.800
their daughter's seventh
grade geometry teacher.

27:02.100 --> 27:04.500
Although I did get an "A" in geometry.

27:04.700 --> 27:06.400
So... you see?

27:06.900 --> 27:08.700
I was contributing...

27:08.900 --> 27:10.300
somethin'.

27:19.300 --> 27:21.000
You know what I hate?

27:23.500 --> 27:26.600
I hate that I wake up every morning,

27:26.900 --> 27:28.700
and I look in the mirror,

27:29.400 --> 27:32.200
and I try and see mom in me--

27:32.400 --> 27:35.800
sweet and kind and gentle.

27:37.200 --> 27:39.300
But I only see you--

27:40.600 --> 27:44.600
sly and crafty and
with one eye on the door.

27:44.700 --> 27:46.400
I hate that.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.900
I hate all the you in me.

27:50.800 --> 27:55.400
Because I don't wanna be sly and
crafty and with one eye on the door.

27:55.400 --> 28:00.500
Because there's nothing there
that can afford happiness to anyone.

28:04.100 --> 28:06.500
I can understand that, yeah.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.200
I want to try...

28:13.300 --> 28:15.200
to change your memories.

28:16.600 --> 28:18.700
I don't know if you can.

28:25.700 --> 28:28.000
But I guess you could try.

28:47.100 --> 28:49.000
You know what's cool
about the tiger beetle,

28:49.100 --> 28:51.300
is that if you scale
speed for body length,

28:51.400 --> 28:54.600
they're about ten times faster
than the best human sprinter.

28:54.600 --> 28:57.200
- I did know that.
- Well, of course you did.

28:59.400 --> 29:01.600
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.600
Do you really drink the blood
of the neighborhood cats?

29:06.500 --> 29:10.100
I enjoy a nice tomato juice every
now and again, but that's about it.

29:11.900 --> 29:14.300
Do you really go out at the stroke
of midnight on Halloween

29:14.400 --> 29:16.500
wearing a suit made of human flesh?

29:16.800 --> 29:18.600
I haven't in years...

29:19.000 --> 29:22.800
ever since the dry cleaner
lost my human flesh suit.

29:23.800 --> 29:26.100
Do you really stay
at home all the time?

29:28.200 --> 29:29.700
Yes.

29:31.200 --> 29:32.500
How come?

29:35.300 --> 29:36.800
Because I'm afraid.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.400
Of what?

29:39.700 --> 29:41.900
I'm not exactly sure.

29:44.100 --> 29:45.700
Were you ever brave?

29:46.600 --> 29:48.400
I think so.

29:49.300 --> 29:51.600
- Eddie's brave.
- He is.

29:51.800 --> 29:54.300
- Nick's brave.
- Not as brave as Eddie.

29:55.100 --> 29:56.900
But he is brave.

29:57.200 --> 29:59.400
I'm not so brave.

29:59.800 --> 30:01.400
You will be.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.800
Mind if I join you?

30:17.700 --> 30:18.900
What?

30:19.200 --> 30:21.700
What do you think
about parallel universes?

30:21.800 --> 30:24.900
I don't think about 'em
all that much. Why?

30:25.400 --> 30:27.100
I hope they exist.

30:28.200 --> 30:30.200
I mean, I'm sure they do,
beyond the physics of it all,

30:30.300 --> 30:33.800
- you know, wormhole theory, all that.
- If you weren't already Phil's girl,

30:33.800 --> 30:36.500
my next line would be,
"boy, do I have a dude for you."

30:41.000 --> 30:43.100
I mean, they just have to exist.

30:44.000 --> 30:48.600
Because there's gotta be another me that
was one of the cool kids in high school.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.200
You know, who all the kids
whispered about

30:52.400 --> 30:55.800
and who played a prank in a knight
costume during seniors week.

30:55.900 --> 30:58.200
That would be ideal.
Another me?

31:00.100 --> 31:03.000
I hope there's a whole bunch of stuff
he's doing out there now.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.300
And a whole bunch of stuff he's not doing.

31:08.300 --> 31:09.600
You know?

31:11.200 --> 31:13.700
- Two shots of tequila, my good man.
- Got it.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
We need more milk for
the white russians.

31:20.400 --> 31:22.400
Well, what's next on the agenda, pop?

31:22.800 --> 31:24.400
I'm gonna turn in.

31:24.700 --> 31:26.400
Whoa! How come?

31:26.500 --> 31:30.200
The whole trip is a bust. The motel's
a dump. The clams are chewy.

31:30.300 --> 31:32.400
And there ain't no damn
squids on the room keys.

31:32.500 --> 31:36.000
- What-- what about the night-swimmin'?
- It's too cold.

31:36.100 --> 31:38.200
The pool's probably
teeming with parasites,

31:38.300 --> 31:41.200
- and we don't have any bathing suits.
- It's not that cold.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.700
All the white russians will
probably kill the parasites.

31:45.500 --> 31:47.500
And we got our boxers.

31:49.100 --> 31:51.500
I gotta say, she ain't exactly my type,

31:51.500 --> 31:54.300
but I was this close to banging
Eddie Latekka's girlfriend.

31:54.300 --> 31:57.100
I would've made some sacrifices
to check that scene out.

32:00.200 --> 32:02.700
Hey, hey, hey,
three shots of vodka, bro.

32:02.700 --> 32:03.900
That's it.

32:03.900 --> 32:05.900
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave the premises.

32:05.900 --> 32:08.700
- What for?
- I will not be called "bro"

32:08.800 --> 32:11.700
in my place of employment.
Not here. Not ever.

32:11.900 --> 32:14.000
Are you kidding me? Bro?

32:14.500 --> 32:16.300
You know why they call me "rooster"?

32:16.300 --> 32:18.100
A lot of people think
it's because of the hair.

32:18.200 --> 32:22.000
Nope. You ever seen two roosters fight?
It ain't that pretty at all.

32:22.100 --> 32:24.500
People pay money to see the blood,
know what I mean?

32:24.700 --> 32:26.000
Now you're out.

32:26.600 --> 32:28.700
All right, all right.
Get off me.

32:29.800 --> 32:31.500
I found one.

33:42.800 --> 33:44.200
Owen, you getting in?

33:45.200 --> 33:46.500
Yes!

33:50.400 --> 33:53.900
Owen, we're wearing our boxers.
Boxers, Owen!

33:54.700 --> 33:57.000
Owen, we're wearing boxers, man!

34:09.600 --> 34:12.699
Why'd you kick out the townies?
'Cause they were spending time with me?

34:13.900 --> 34:15.600
They were groping the staff.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.600
Okay? Including me.

34:17.699 --> 34:19.900
I may have never been
a cool kid at school, Janet,

34:19.900 --> 34:22.400
but here, I am the prom king.

34:22.900 --> 34:24.300
Let's go.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.300
No matter how much time passes,

34:38.400 --> 34:41.000
Hannah Daniels will always
be the coolest...

34:41.199 --> 34:42.800
frickin' ever.

35:13.600 --> 35:15.200
Where's Aubrey and gabe?

35:16.500 --> 35:17.900
I'll get them.

35:21.000 --> 35:22.500
Aubrey?

35:24.200 --> 35:25.600
Where's your dad?

35:26.000 --> 35:27.400
He's gone.

35:27.600 --> 35:29.100
Gone where?

35:30.000 --> 35:31.600
Who knows?

35:31.700 --> 35:36.000
Barcelona? Tuscany?
The washington zoo?

35:36.900 --> 35:39.700
Who knows where he goes
when he goes?

35:41.000 --> 35:42.500
But he's gone.

35:43.100 --> 35:44.300
Sorry.

35:44.400 --> 35:48.500
He wanted me to thank you for
helping him get what he came for.

35:48.500 --> 35:49.900
Get what he came for?

35:50.000 --> 35:54.100
To reconnect with his daughter
and then get out of dodge.

35:54.200 --> 35:56.400
So he had this planned all along, huh?

35:56.500 --> 35:58.000
Pretty much.

35:58.200 --> 36:00.000
To come here and...

36:00.300 --> 36:03.700
leave the Thunderbird at the motel
so they wouldn't know he left.

36:08.300 --> 36:09.600
You okay?

36:09.600 --> 36:14.300
I'm okay and not just
because my dad is gonna be safe.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.400
He's not the only one
who wanted to thank you.

36:20.100 --> 36:21.900
So thank you...

36:22.100 --> 36:23.900
for getting involved.

36:24.400 --> 36:26.200
Anytime.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.700
The fall.

36:46.600 --> 36:48.300
You picked a wedding date.

36:48.800 --> 36:50.700
It must've come to me in a dream.

36:50.800 --> 36:54.300
Either that, or a night out with the
girls really made you miss your man.

36:54.900 --> 36:57.300
You picked the earliest
of the three dates.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.900
- How'd it go?
- We had the best time ever.

37:05.300 --> 37:08.200
- "We"?
- Me, Eddie and Physical Phil.

37:09.500 --> 37:12.400
Pizza girl ain't the only one
who delivers around here.

37:17.400 --> 37:19.300
Take it from me, little boy,

37:19.800 --> 37:23.600
stay away from the drink,
and you will know joy.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.100
You have a really cool boyfriend.

37:27.500 --> 37:30.500
Let me guess.
"Supreme combat" pasta?

37:30.600 --> 37:34.000
No, just bugs and tennis rackets.

37:35.400 --> 37:37.800
Bugs and tennis rackets?

37:39.200 --> 37:42.000
I do have a really cool boyfriend.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.000
I don't know what this road trip
was about, Robert,

39:32.000 --> 39:35.900
but if there's something wrong with you,
you need to know what it is, not avoid it.

39:36.100 --> 39:40.400
- Now the doctors-- they want to--
- I know there's something wrong with me.

39:40.600 --> 39:43.000
I don't need a doctor to tell me.

39:47.000 --> 39:50.600
Because it's never good news
when they wanna run more tests.

39:51.100 --> 39:53.600
And they will... tomorrow.

39:53.900 --> 39:55.800
But before that happens,

39:56.400 --> 39:59.600
I just wanted to have one more day.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.900
One more day with my boys...

40:06.000 --> 40:08.400
where we lived...

40:09.400 --> 40:12.400
like... giants.

40:14.600 --> 40:16.300
And did you?

40:21.000 --> 40:22.700
We did.

40:32.700 --> 40:33.900
Hello?

40:34.000 --> 40:35.500
This is Owen.

40:35.700 --> 40:37.400
Jenny?

40:37.600 --> 40:39.700
- Jenny who?
- Dude?

40:41.800 --> 40:43.800
Oh, Jenny!
