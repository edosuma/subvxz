00:14.248 --> 00:18.984
(hinges creaking)

00:25.926 --> 00:27.926
Who's out there?

00:42.943 --> 00:44.343
(ghost) Where is my love?

00:44.412 --> 00:46.879
Where is my one true love?

00:46.947 --> 00:48.614
Are you Josephine?

00:48.682 --> 00:51.016
Max and Tess found a
notebook that talked about

00:51.085 --> 00:52.451
Josephine Hunter's one true love.

00:55.523 --> 00:57.256
What are you looking for?

00:57.324 --> 01:01.860
I'm on a quest for my one true love.

01:01.929 --> 01:03.629
Can I help?

01:03.697 --> 01:05.096
I know every inch of this house.

01:05.166 --> 01:07.366
Yes, please. Do help me.

01:07.435 --> 01:09.768
Where would somebody hide a true love?

01:10.971 --> 01:12.204
Was he a knight in armor?

01:12.273 --> 01:13.472
'Cause we have one of those...

01:18.245 --> 01:20.379
Don't think I'm dreaming.

01:24.118 --> 01:25.684
(rooster crowing)

01:27.721 --> 01:29.221
(kids roaring)

01:29.290 --> 01:33.358
♪♪

01:33.427 --> 01:35.027
(kids laughing)

01:36.330 --> 01:37.262
(doorbell screams and
laughs maniacally)

01:37.331 --> 01:38.630
(kids) Aah!

01:38.699 --> 01:42.000
(laughing continues)

01:42.069 --> 01:44.002
How cool is this app?

01:44.071 --> 01:46.905
It's got like ten
different scary voices.

01:46.974 --> 01:48.240
And what about that...

01:48.309 --> 01:49.708
(doorbell screams) ...our doorbell?

01:49.777 --> 01:51.944
(chuckles) Pretty scary.

01:52.012 --> 01:55.681
See, I rewired it to bypass
the regular bell and trigger

01:55.749 --> 01:58.050
a MIDI file of the scream instead.

01:58.119 --> 02:00.185
Most people don't think
about doorbells much,

02:00.254 --> 02:02.421
but they're really pretty remarkable.

02:02.490 --> 02:04.423
Guys! Guys!

02:04.492 --> 02:06.592
You... you forgot your candy!

02:10.997 --> 02:12.331
(shutter clicking) Stop!

02:12.399 --> 02:14.766
Why? Those are worms!

02:14.835 --> 02:16.869
Slimy worms. Nothing beats

02:16.937 --> 02:20.606
a nice, juicy, slimy worm.

02:20.674 --> 02:21.874
It's an old Halloween classic.

02:21.942 --> 02:23.842
Made it myself.

02:25.146 --> 02:27.746
It's such a mess around here.

02:29.350 --> 02:31.283
I put an ad online.

02:31.352 --> 02:33.285
The new cleaning lady is
coming this afternoon.

02:33.354 --> 02:35.120
She can start right away.

02:35.189 --> 02:36.655
I once heard this story

02:36.724 --> 02:38.624
about a cleaning lady.

02:38.692 --> 02:42.294
It was Halloween, and
she disappeared...

02:42.363 --> 02:43.862
down the shower drain.

02:43.931 --> 02:45.964
(slurps worm)

02:47.668 --> 02:49.001
(chuckles nervously)

02:49.069 --> 02:51.737
(Tess) Anything about Josephine
and her one true love?

02:51.805 --> 02:52.771
Uh-uh.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.840
But, I know everything there is

02:54.909 --> 02:57.309
to know about Dutch taxes
in the 19th century.

02:57.378 --> 02:59.978
Who knows, might come in handy someday.

03:00.047 --> 03:02.548
Yeah, maybe if I become
an accountant...

03:02.616 --> 03:05.317
with a time machine.

03:05.386 --> 03:06.318
(sighs)

03:06.387 --> 03:08.120
Can we do this someplace else?

03:08.189 --> 03:10.389
All the books about the
Hunters are in here.

03:10.457 --> 03:12.090
So? Let's just...

03:12.159 --> 03:14.893
take 'em out or something.

03:14.962 --> 03:16.295
What if the door closes and
we get locked in again?

03:16.363 --> 03:18.363
I've got something! What?

03:18.432 --> 03:22.568
"Josephine Hunter. Born
in the 17th century."

03:22.636 --> 03:25.470
She's buried right here in Amsterdam.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.673
Maybe her one true love
is buried next to her.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.741
Let's go find her grave!

03:29.810 --> 03:32.344
You mean like at a cemetery?

03:32.413 --> 03:33.779
No, at a hot dog stand, genius.

03:33.847 --> 03:34.780
Of course, a cemetery.

03:34.848 --> 03:37.583
Oh, right. Right.

03:37.651 --> 03:38.917
A cemetery on Halloween.

03:38.986 --> 03:41.220
There's nothing scary about that.

03:41.288 --> 03:43.822
Max. Yeah, I'm coming.

03:45.392 --> 03:46.992
(knocking)

03:51.732 --> 03:53.832
(ethereal laughter)

03:53.901 --> 03:55.734
Josephine, is that you?

03:55.803 --> 03:59.037
(ethereal laughter)

04:01.242 --> 04:03.175
You're supposed to be scared, Anika.

04:03.244 --> 04:05.210
Oh, sorry. Just thought
you were a ghost.

04:05.279 --> 04:07.746
You did?

04:07.815 --> 04:09.815
That's what I wanted you to think.

04:09.883 --> 04:11.450
I built this voice processing app.

04:11.518 --> 04:13.919
It's got, like, ten different
scary voices, and...

04:15.556 --> 04:17.555
What are you doing?

04:17.625 --> 04:18.857
Oh, I'm looking for Josephine.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.659
I saw her right here last night.

04:20.728 --> 04:21.959
She's a ghost.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.229
There are no such thing
as ghosts, Anika.

04:24.298 --> 04:26.265
Yes, there are. Not
according to science.

04:26.333 --> 04:27.799
Well, you can tell her that yourself

04:27.868 --> 04:29.167
when we see her again.

04:29.236 --> 04:30.636
Trust me, she doesn't exist,

04:30.704 --> 04:32.204
so there's nothing to be afraid of.

04:32.273 --> 04:33.205
I'm not afraid.

04:33.274 --> 04:35.207
I'm just telling you what I saw.

04:38.212 --> 04:40.746
(eerie screaming)

04:42.283 --> 04:45.083
What an unusual doorbell.

04:45.152 --> 04:47.486
I bet that keeps the salesmen away.

04:47.554 --> 04:50.989
Oh, yeah. It's just for Halloween.

04:51.058 --> 04:53.525
Oh, you're the new cleaning lady.

04:53.594 --> 04:55.594
I'm Dolly. Are your parents home?

04:55.663 --> 04:58.363
They're... they're working. Oh.

04:58.432 --> 05:00.299
I'm Daniel. I'm the oldest.

05:00.367 --> 05:02.401
I'm almost 18.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.336
(Max) All right, see you later.

05:04.405 --> 05:08.407
We're going to the grave of...

05:08.475 --> 05:10.876
...the unknown poet.

05:10.944 --> 05:14.012
Right, on Dam Square.

05:14.081 --> 05:15.480
I didn't know there was an unknown poet

05:15.549 --> 05:17.049
buried at Dam Square.

05:17.117 --> 05:21.119
That's why he's unknown.

05:22.856 --> 05:26.224
Yeah, it's tragic. Nice meeting you.
Yeah.

05:27.795 --> 05:30.162
(laughs uncomfortably)

05:30.230 --> 05:32.297
Slimy worm? Thank you.

05:32.366 --> 05:34.199
Don't mind if I do.

05:34.268 --> 05:37.069
Mmm! Delicious!

05:37.137 --> 05:39.104
They're homemade.

05:39.173 --> 05:40.138
Oh.

05:40.207 --> 05:41.373
This is my little sister,

05:41.442 --> 05:42.441
Anika.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.042
Have we met before?

05:44.111 --> 05:46.078
I don't think so.

05:46.146 --> 05:47.346
You look so familiar.

05:47.414 --> 05:50.382
Mmm! You know, I hear that a lot.

05:50.451 --> 05:53.819
I guess I've just got
one of those faces.

05:53.887 --> 05:57.122
That's not it. It'll come to me.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.259
(laughs uncomfortably)

06:04.665 --> 06:07.132
Okay. Bye! Oh!

06:07.201 --> 06:08.400
What a sweet child.

06:08.469 --> 06:10.936
Well, I should get started.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.371
Then, you'll be able to tell me

06:12.439 --> 06:14.573
whether or not you want to hire me.

06:14.641 --> 06:16.508
Good plan. (laughing)

06:21.014 --> 06:22.481
(Tess) These are all the new ones.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.049
The old ones are way back there.

06:24.118 --> 06:25.283
How do you know that?

06:25.352 --> 06:28.086
I come here a lot.

06:28.155 --> 06:30.222
Okay.

06:30.290 --> 06:31.490
Wait. What for?

06:31.558 --> 06:34.025
For reading or walking around.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.395
It's peaceful and relaxing.

06:36.463 --> 06:39.097
Yeah. I'm super chilled out right now.

06:40.334 --> 06:42.467
(Tess) Hey, there's Spooky Pete.

06:42.536 --> 06:43.468
Hi, Pete!

06:44.705 --> 06:48.373
Spooky Pete? The nickname fits him.

06:48.442 --> 06:51.376
You're gonna love him. He's a riot.
Come on.

06:58.185 --> 06:59.951
You look like a mad scientist.

07:00.020 --> 07:02.754
(Sal) These are super-powerful
heat-sensing glasses

07:02.823 --> 07:05.056
for an experiment.
What's the experiment?

07:05.125 --> 07:07.592
I'm looking for your ghost.

07:07.661 --> 07:08.827
I thought you didn't believe in ghosts.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.695
I don't, but all good scientists

07:10.764 --> 07:12.330
have to test their hypotheses.

07:12.399 --> 07:14.633
If there's anything out
there, they'll find it.

07:14.701 --> 07:16.168
It can even see through walls.

07:16.236 --> 07:19.204
Cool! That'd be great
for hide and seek.

07:19.273 --> 07:20.405
If there's a ghost in this house,

07:20.474 --> 07:22.240
I'll find it, but there's not gonna be,

07:22.309 --> 07:23.542
so you don't have to be afraid.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.811
I'm not afraid. Ghosts are cool.

07:25.879 --> 07:26.845
Right.

07:26.914 --> 07:29.247
(high-pitched mechanical whining)

07:29.316 --> 07:32.083
Aah! What do you see?

07:32.152 --> 07:34.252
I'm not sure. Hang on.

07:34.321 --> 07:35.253
Is it a ghost?

07:35.322 --> 07:38.323
No, Anika, I don't think...

07:38.392 --> 07:39.324
I bet it's Josephine.

07:39.393 --> 07:40.826
No, it can't be!

07:43.096 --> 07:45.230
(gasping)

07:45.299 --> 07:47.365
Mind if I clean here?

07:47.434 --> 07:49.534
No, please, go ahead.

07:49.603 --> 07:50.936
We're just about done here,

07:51.004 --> 07:52.771
aren't we, Anika? Halloween costumes

07:52.840 --> 07:54.706
are getting more elaborate every year.

07:54.775 --> 07:56.274
Oh, it's not a costume.

07:56.343 --> 07:57.976
It's for science.

07:58.045 --> 07:59.110
He made them to see ghosts.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.312
He's a genius.

08:00.380 --> 08:03.181
Wow. I bet you want to grow up

08:03.250 --> 08:04.549
to be an inventor, don't you?

08:04.618 --> 08:06.818
Maybe. I don't know.

08:06.887 --> 08:09.321
I'm a big fan of Neil deGrasse Tyson.

08:09.389 --> 08:10.489
Neil who?

08:10.557 --> 08:12.390
The most famous
astrophysicist in the world.

08:12.459 --> 08:13.692
Oh. Well, I bet you're going to be

08:13.760 --> 08:15.727
just as smart as he is.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.100
She's nice.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.168
(high-pitched mechanical whining)

08:23.237 --> 08:25.704
She still looks really familiar.

08:25.772 --> 08:27.572
(Tess) You find anything?

08:27.641 --> 08:29.741
(Max) Nope.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.018
Tess.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.259
Whoa.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.933
"Kees Hunter."

08:55.002 --> 08:57.135
It's pronounced "Kase."

08:57.204 --> 09:00.639
Kees must have been
Josephine's one true love.

09:04.845 --> 09:05.844
"Thieves."

09:12.019 --> 09:13.985
(Pete clears his throat)

09:15.622 --> 09:16.721
You guys find what you
were looking for?

09:18.825 --> 09:20.025
Yeah.

09:20.093 --> 09:22.060
Yeah. Josephine Hunter.

09:22.129 --> 09:23.295
Ever heard of her?

09:23.363 --> 09:24.996
As a matter of fact, I have.

09:26.233 --> 09:29.034
Really? Can you tell us about her?

09:29.102 --> 09:30.268
Why don't you come on over

09:30.337 --> 09:32.070
and we'll see what we can dig up.

09:32.139 --> 09:35.840
Dig up. Get it? A
little cemetery humor.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.175
(laughing)

09:37.244 --> 09:38.777
You know, I've got a million of 'em.

09:38.845 --> 09:39.844
(laughing)

09:39.913 --> 09:42.547
As a matter of fact,
just the other day,

09:42.616 --> 09:45.884
a guy comes by and says he
wants to bury his robot.

09:45.953 --> 09:48.520
Guess what he wants on
the tombstone, huh?

09:48.589 --> 09:52.090
"Rust in peace." (laughing)

09:52.159 --> 09:55.026
Yeah! Oh, yeah. I got another one.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

09:55.095 --> 10:00.231
Josephine Hunter is buried
next to old Kees over there,

10:00.300 --> 10:03.168
and if you believe the stories,

10:03.236 --> 10:05.670
there were two men in her life.

10:08.041 --> 10:10.809
She lost 'em both.

10:10.877 --> 10:15.180
They say she never smiled again.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.916
She was famous for a diamond

10:17.985 --> 10:22.554
big as a walnut, a gift from Kees.

10:22.623 --> 10:25.357
Here's where it gets interesting.

10:25.425 --> 10:28.226
No one knows what became of it.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.762
It just disappeared.

10:30.831 --> 10:33.064
You know, stories, right?

10:33.133 --> 10:34.766
(laughing)

10:34.835 --> 10:37.936
But by the looks of the tombstone,

10:38.005 --> 10:41.506
somebody didn't like her very much.

10:41.575 --> 10:43.742
This has all the details of her life.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.310
Can we take a look?

10:45.379 --> 10:46.845
We are Hunters, after all.

10:46.913 --> 10:48.980
Well, you'll need a
letter of authorization

10:49.049 --> 10:52.350
signed by a judge. Huh?

10:52.419 --> 10:54.219
Just kidding. You can look.

10:54.287 --> 10:56.454
Nothing much in there. Go ahead.

10:56.523 --> 10:59.991
Information about upkeep of the grave,

11:00.060 --> 11:02.460
a list of the next of kin,

11:02.529 --> 11:05.397
just a bunch of old, dusty documents.

11:05.465 --> 11:08.199
Cookie, anybody? Ah!

11:09.970 --> 11:11.069
Sure you're not gonna have
one of these cookies?

11:11.138 --> 11:12.070
They're pretty good.

11:12.139 --> 11:13.238
(sputtering)

11:13.306 --> 11:14.339
(clears throat)

11:14.408 --> 11:15.340
(coughing)

11:15.409 --> 11:17.042
Uh, Spooky Pete,

11:17.110 --> 11:18.176
would you mind

11:18.245 --> 11:20.445
if I had another cup of tea, please?

11:20.514 --> 11:25.717
Certainly, my boy. Have
as much as you'd like.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.886
I enjoy a cup...

11:27.954 --> 11:28.920
(clinking)

11:28.989 --> 11:33.391
What? Eh? What's that? Here you go.

11:33.460 --> 11:34.592
And help yourself to a cookie.

11:34.661 --> 11:36.194
Now, don't be shy.

11:36.263 --> 11:39.764
(eerie screaming)

11:42.135 --> 11:46.271
I, uh, was just dropping by

11:46.339 --> 11:47.839
to see if Erik and Kate

11:47.908 --> 11:49.374
were back from their trip yet.

11:49.443 --> 11:50.775
Who are you looking for?

11:50.844 --> 11:53.445
Erik and Kate Hunter.

11:53.513 --> 11:55.680
I spoke with her Uncle
Casper the other day.

11:55.749 --> 11:57.882
Casper.

11:57.951 --> 12:01.319
Oh, hey, Mr. Terkel. How's it going?

12:01.388 --> 12:03.555
Hi, Daniel. Are your folks back yet?

12:05.525 --> 12:08.193
And this is?

12:08.261 --> 12:12.163
Oh, she's our, uh...

12:12.232 --> 12:14.566
Their aunt. Aunt Dolly.

12:14.634 --> 12:16.067
Casper's sister.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.869
Casper had to go out of town.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.904
He asked me to look after the children.

12:19.973 --> 12:21.606
Okay.

12:21.675 --> 12:23.708
And don't you worry about
anything over here.

12:23.777 --> 12:27.011
Aunt Dolly's got
everything under control.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.580
(laughing)

12:30.317 --> 12:31.883
(Dolly) So what was that all about?

12:31.952 --> 12:33.485
Tim would freak out if he found out

12:33.553 --> 12:34.719
we didn't have adult supervision,

12:34.788 --> 12:36.154
but I don't see what the big deal is.

12:36.223 --> 12:39.257
I'm almost 18. I can...

12:39.326 --> 12:42.127
So you've been taking care of this crew

12:42.195 --> 12:44.229
all by yourself?

12:44.297 --> 12:46.564
How's that going? Exhausting.

12:46.633 --> 12:48.933
Oh, I imagine they're quite a handful.

12:49.002 --> 12:50.602
Tell me about it.

12:50.670 --> 12:52.470
What I wouldn't give to
be able to sleep in,

12:52.539 --> 12:53.805
have somebody make me breakfast

12:53.874 --> 12:55.807
instead of the other way around.

12:55.876 --> 12:58.777
Somebody will. Who?

12:58.845 --> 13:01.780
Me! Really?

13:01.848 --> 13:04.816
Yes. Sleep as long as you want.

13:04.885 --> 13:05.917
I'll come over in the morning

13:05.986 --> 13:07.352
and make breakfast for everyone.

13:07.420 --> 13:08.953
That's awesome.

13:09.022 --> 13:11.222
Oh. What's wrong?

13:11.291 --> 13:13.124
Someone will have to let me in.

13:13.193 --> 13:15.360
I'll probably wake you
when I ring the doorbell.

13:15.428 --> 13:17.228
It'll defeat the whole purpose.

13:17.297 --> 13:20.365
Not necessarily.

13:20.433 --> 13:21.633
I'll give you a key.

13:21.701 --> 13:24.068
What a great idea.

13:27.174 --> 13:30.975
So I asked the guy, why aren't
you coming to his funeral?

13:31.044 --> 13:33.678
And he says to me, why should I?

13:33.747 --> 13:36.948
He's not coming to mine.

13:37.017 --> 13:37.949
(all laughing)

13:38.018 --> 13:39.117
I like that one.

13:39.186 --> 13:41.052
Oh, you're the best, Pete.

13:41.121 --> 13:42.821
You two come again soon, huh?

13:42.889 --> 13:44.789
We will. Good, good.

13:44.858 --> 13:46.858
Can I hug you?

13:46.927 --> 13:49.427
If you insist. (laughing)

13:49.496 --> 13:51.229
Uh, Tess.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.633
Oh! Okay. (laughing)

13:55.702 --> 13:57.101
Well. Hey?

13:57.170 --> 13:58.269
Oh, I'm really more of a handshake...

13:58.338 --> 14:01.039
Oh, come on! (laughing)

14:01.107 --> 14:04.943
What a fine young man. Hey,
you come back soon, eh?

14:05.011 --> 14:08.246
And don't wait 'til they make
me a permanent resident here,

14:08.315 --> 14:09.781
if you know what I mean. Okay, we will.

14:09.850 --> 14:12.116
(laughing) Permanent resident.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.918
(laughing)

14:13.987 --> 14:15.753
Did you see that? I almost had the key.

14:18.558 --> 14:19.824
The hug.

14:19.893 --> 14:21.759
Sly boots.

14:21.828 --> 14:23.194
All right. I'm gonna bring it back

14:23.263 --> 14:25.163
as soon as we know what it opens.

14:26.633 --> 14:29.267
We found a key. At Josephine's gra...

14:29.336 --> 14:31.803
...ave. Hi, Dolly.

14:31.872 --> 14:34.706
Well, I was just on my way out.

14:34.774 --> 14:37.976
You can tell Daniel and Anika
your story in a minute.

14:38.044 --> 14:41.346
I'll be back tomorrow
to take care of you.

14:43.850 --> 14:45.650
Although you look like someone

14:45.719 --> 14:47.085
who can take care of himself.

14:52.893 --> 14:53.892
I like her.

14:53.960 --> 14:56.461
She's a gift from heaven.

14:56.529 --> 14:58.162
I don't know. (Anika) I do know her.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.265
I just don't know how I know her.

15:00.333 --> 15:01.866
(screaming)

15:01.935 --> 15:02.934
I'll get it.

15:03.003 --> 15:05.937
That's not the doorbell. That's Sal.

15:09.976 --> 15:12.777
(Tess) Sal, are you okay?

15:12.846 --> 15:15.713
I'm fine. Everything's okay.

15:15.782 --> 15:17.248
You screamed.

15:17.317 --> 15:21.753
It was nothing. Just an experiment.

15:21.821 --> 15:23.955
Are those virtual reality goggles?

15:24.024 --> 15:27.458
No, they're something I
invented to show Anika

15:27.527 --> 15:28.993
there are no ghosts in the house.

15:29.062 --> 15:31.996
It didn't work out quite exactly
like I thought it would.

15:32.065 --> 15:33.631
You saw something?

15:33.700 --> 15:35.900
I'm not saying it was a ghost,

15:35.969 --> 15:37.902
but it might have been a ghost.

15:37.971 --> 15:39.037
Josephine.

15:39.105 --> 15:40.438
That's crazy.

15:40.507 --> 15:41.906
Talk to us, Josephine. Are you here?

15:41.975 --> 15:42.907
(rattling)

15:42.976 --> 15:46.577
(gasping)

15:46.646 --> 15:49.280
You had to ask?

15:49.349 --> 15:53.284
Don't worry, guys.
Everything's gonna be okay.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.820
I'm not worried. It's just Josephine.

15:55.889 --> 15:58.289
She's nice. Of course she is.

15:58.358 --> 16:00.158
But let's just all stay together

16:00.226 --> 16:02.160
because it's fun.

16:02.228 --> 16:03.995
And energy efficient.

16:04.064 --> 16:05.697
Huddling together is the best way

16:05.765 --> 16:07.165
to maintain core body temperature.

16:07.233 --> 16:10.201
(rattling) (whimpering)

16:10.270 --> 16:14.572
That was... That was
just the heater, right?

16:14.641 --> 16:17.475
Yeah. Of course. That's what it is.

16:17.544 --> 16:20.111
Yeah, sure. Say good night, guys.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.480
(takes picture) Night, Josephine.

16:32.959 --> 16:34.325
(groaning)

16:40.633 --> 16:43.067
(rooster crowing)

16:45.538 --> 16:47.138
(knocking on door)

16:50.210 --> 16:52.944
Good morning.

16:53.013 --> 16:54.912
Did everybody have a
good night's sleep?

16:54.981 --> 16:57.081
Oh, I slept like a baby.

16:57.150 --> 16:59.317
I was up every hour
and cried all night.

16:59.386 --> 17:01.619
(laughing)

17:01.688 --> 17:06.023
Oh, Tess, I hear you love to read.

17:06.092 --> 17:08.526
I brought some very
special old books with me

17:08.595 --> 17:11.462
and I thought maybe you'd
like to take a look.

17:11.531 --> 17:14.665
Old books. Tess, what
are you waiting for?

17:14.733 --> 17:16.200
Okay, I guess.

17:16.269 --> 17:20.070
After breakfast. Enjoy.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.140
(door closes)

17:22.208 --> 17:23.641
(grunting and groaning)

17:23.710 --> 17:25.675
I'm getting the doughnut.
I'm getting the...

17:25.744 --> 17:28.012
♪♪

17:30.250 --> 17:32.683
If this Pete guy was right,

17:32.752 --> 17:34.919
then Josephine had two men in her life.

17:34.988 --> 17:37.555
How do we figure out

17:37.624 --> 17:39.424
which one was her one true love?

17:39.492 --> 17:40.825
Did you guys find anything?

17:40.894 --> 17:42.660
No. We're still working on it.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.595
Maybe it wasn't one of them.

17:44.664 --> 17:46.064
Maybe it was a pet.

17:46.132 --> 17:47.765
This one foster family I stayed with

17:47.834 --> 17:50.001
definitely loved their dog
more than each other.

17:50.070 --> 17:52.103
I knew it!

17:52.172 --> 17:54.005
I told you she looked familiar!

17:54.074 --> 17:55.506
Hedwig Hunter?

17:55.575 --> 17:59.444
Aunt Hedwig. She used to
come over on holidays.

17:59.512 --> 18:02.080
Why would she say she's the
cleaning lady if she's a Hunter?

18:02.148 --> 18:03.748
Yeah, and where's...

18:03.817 --> 18:04.982
...Tess?

18:05.051 --> 18:06.818
(gasping)

18:06.886 --> 18:09.120
Tess! Tess! Tess!

18:09.189 --> 18:10.321
Tess! Tess! Tess!

18:10.390 --> 18:11.823
Where are you, Tess? Tess!

18:11.891 --> 18:12.824
Tess! Tess! Tess!

18:12.892 --> 18:15.326
Tess! Tess! Tess!

18:15.395 --> 18:16.861
Have you seen Aunt Hedwig or Tess?

18:16.930 --> 18:18.996
Aunt who? Aunt Hedwig! Aunt Hedwig!

18:19.065 --> 18:21.566
Oh, no, she just said she was our aunt

18:21.634 --> 18:23.701
to get rid of Tim. Aunt Dolly.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.736
She really is our aunt...
our great aunt.

18:25.805 --> 18:28.873
She's Erik's mother's sister.
Her name is Hedwig.

18:28.942 --> 18:29.974
(scream) (thud)

18:31.511 --> 18:33.611
Tess! Tess! Tess!

18:37.851 --> 18:41.052
This is where I saw Josephine.

18:50.430 --> 18:54.232
Anika, wait.

19:02.308 --> 19:03.374
You stay here.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.076
Just give a shout if you see something.

19:05.145 --> 19:07.278
Are you sure? I'm sure.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.091
Guys?

19:26.332 --> 19:27.365
Tess!

19:28.902 --> 19:30.334
What happened? Tess!

19:30.403 --> 19:31.402
(groaning)

19:31.471 --> 19:34.805
Are you okay? Are you okay?

19:34.874 --> 19:37.141
She wanted Josephine's key.

19:37.210 --> 19:38.743
She overpowered me and...

19:38.811 --> 19:40.578
Now you're all here.

19:40.647 --> 19:42.113
Auntie Hedwig?

19:42.182 --> 19:44.582
Don't call me that. I'm not your aunt

19:44.651 --> 19:47.485
because I'm a real Hunter.

19:47.554 --> 19:48.586
We're real Hunters too.

19:48.655 --> 19:50.087
Erik and Kate are our parents.

19:50.156 --> 19:52.023
That's right. We love
them and they love us,

19:52.091 --> 19:53.357
and there's nothing
you can do about it,

19:53.426 --> 19:54.792
you mean old witch.

19:54.861 --> 19:58.196
Oh, well, if Erik and
Kate loved you so much,

19:58.264 --> 19:59.797
where are they?

20:02.035 --> 20:05.303
I'm only here to take
what's rightfully mine

20:05.371 --> 20:07.205
before you little mongrels

20:07.273 --> 20:09.674
get your grubby little paws on it.

20:09.742 --> 20:12.076
That was you last night.

20:12.145 --> 20:16.447
You really think I'm the
ghost of Josephine?

20:16.516 --> 20:19.717
(wind blowing)

20:19.786 --> 20:21.319
(ghostly male voice) Hedwig!

20:21.387 --> 20:22.520
(Hedwig gasps)

20:22.589 --> 20:24.755
(ghostly male voice)
What are you doing here?

20:24.824 --> 20:28.759
Wh... what? Wh... wh... wh...
what's happening?

20:28.828 --> 20:31.062
(ghostly male voice) Leave
this house, Hedwig!

20:31.130 --> 20:35.266
You are not a true Hunter
and never shall be!

20:35.335 --> 20:38.769
Nothing of mine shall ever be yours!
(gasping)

20:38.838 --> 20:42.873
Leave this house at
once or dare to try me!

20:42.942 --> 20:48.779
You'll find me challenging! (laughter)

20:52.986 --> 20:55.686
(laughing)

20:55.755 --> 20:57.922
(all laughing)

20:57.991 --> 20:59.790
(Max) I knew it was you the whole time.

20:59.859 --> 21:00.958
Uh...

21:08.134 --> 21:11.836
This must be Josephine's secret room.

21:11.904 --> 21:14.071
(Anika) She looks exactly
like the Josephine

21:14.140 --> 21:16.574
I saw in the hallway.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.042
Maybe there's something in
here that could tell us

21:18.111 --> 21:20.244
who Josephine's one true love was.

21:20.313 --> 21:24.382
Maybe the question isn't
who was her one true love

21:24.450 --> 21:26.083
but what.
