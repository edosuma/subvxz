WEBVTT

00:05.048 --> 00:07.151
So, we built a machine
powerful enough to big-bang

00:07.175 --> 00:08.510
a new Speed Force into existence,

00:08.593 --> 00:12.555
based solely on the teachings
of history's most evil speedster.

00:13.682 --> 00:15.684
Are we sure we wanna hit this switch?

00:27.445 --> 00:28.445
Do it.

01:02.814 --> 01:05.358
Uh, what's happening?

01:13.575 --> 01:14.784
It didn't work.

01:35.722 --> 01:37.682
Guys, you in there?

01:38.933 --> 01:41.269
Hey. Sorry to interrupt.

01:41.394 --> 01:45.190
- Oh, um, how did the machine test go?
- Well, it didn't.

01:45.273 --> 01:46.483
That's the problem.

01:46.566 --> 01:48.359
How did Thawne manage to build

01:48.443 --> 01:51.571
a Speed Force machine on his own
without a journal to guide him,

01:51.654 --> 01:55.450
but all the brainpower in S.T.A.R. Labs
can't even get this thing to work?

01:55.867 --> 01:58.369
It's like we built a 12-ton paperweight.

01:58.995 --> 02:00.538
Okay, okay, but, hey, uh,

02:00.622 --> 02:03.458
maybe getting out of here for a minute
might clear your heads.

02:03.625 --> 02:07.921
I myself was on my way over to
<i>The Citizen</i> right now. Does anybody...

02:08.295 --> 02:10.507
Barry, wanna come with me?

02:12.425 --> 02:14.552
No. Look, every day
that the machine is off

02:14.636 --> 02:16.471
is another day I can't
protect this city.

02:16.554 --> 02:17.889
I have to keep working.

02:21.184 --> 02:22.602
Barry, wait.

02:24.270 --> 02:25.870
Are you sure you don't want to see Iris?

02:30.276 --> 02:32.111
Can I tell her anything for you?

02:34.489 --> 02:35.907
Tell her I miss her.

02:42.163 --> 02:46.251
His speed has been draining nonstop.
Your plan was a success.

02:46.459 --> 02:48.169
You've done an amazing job.

02:50.713 --> 02:52.131
Is everything okay?

02:52.841 --> 02:53.841
You seem...

02:54.801 --> 02:55.801
distant.

02:56.010 --> 02:57.053
Sorry, um...

02:57.971 --> 03:00.974
I'd just like to know if you want us
to proceed with the next phase.

03:01.057 --> 03:02.057
Yes.

03:02.517 --> 03:04.519
Go join your brother and prepare,

03:05.186 --> 03:09.399
because tonight,
I will finally have my liberation.

03:10.191 --> 03:11.752
- Success is assured.
- Success is assured.

03:15.864 --> 03:16.864
Come in.

03:18.157 --> 03:20.451
- Hey, you busy?
- Hey, what's up?

03:20.910 --> 03:21.995
I just wanted to...

03:29.544 --> 03:31.045
You're here about me and Barry?

03:32.130 --> 03:33.130
Yeah.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.552
He's in a really bad place, Iris.

03:38.511 --> 03:41.723
His heart is breaking.
He won't talk to anybody about it.

03:42.140 --> 03:43.576
He promised me after he took Nora
to the future,

03:43.600 --> 03:44.809
that would be the last time

03:44.893 --> 03:47.437
that he made a decision
about our family without me.

03:47.937 --> 03:50.040
But then he took my dad into WITSEC
and didn't even tell me.

03:50.064 --> 03:51.566
I had to find out from Singh.

03:51.941 --> 03:53.610
How do you get over that, Cecile?

03:53.985 --> 03:54.985
Well...

03:55.904 --> 03:57.071
I don't really know, Iris,

03:57.155 --> 04:00.491
but I would think
the first step is wanting to.

04:01.242 --> 04:02.619
What do you want?

04:11.127 --> 04:13.755
I... I don't know.

04:17.716 --> 04:20.345
Can you feel what I want?

04:21.721 --> 04:23.014
Can you tell me?

04:30.605 --> 04:33.608
You feel... sad.

04:34.692 --> 04:37.362
Sad and concerned.

04:38.404 --> 04:40.323
I think what Iris needs right now
is space

04:40.406 --> 04:42.992
to focus on what's really important.

04:44.494 --> 04:46.454
Right, uh...

04:46.955 --> 04:50.875
It's important for me to take care
of myself right now, Cecile.

04:53.503 --> 04:54.963
Okay, yeah, um...

04:57.715 --> 05:00.259
Your husband wanted me to tell you
that he misses you.

05:14.357 --> 05:15.357
Barr?

05:16.067 --> 05:17.753
- Hey.
- There's something blocking the door.

05:17.777 --> 05:18.777
Yeah, um...

05:18.861 --> 05:20.214
I thought you were still
at the speed lab.

05:20.238 --> 05:21.238
Uh...

05:22.448 --> 05:23.616
- Hey, Barry...
- Hold on.

05:23.700 --> 05:26.411
- Why can't I get inside my own house?
- Sorry. Hold on.

05:26.744 --> 05:28.329
- Give me a sec, okay?
- Geez.

05:33.001 --> 05:34.544
Cecile, I can explain.

05:36.170 --> 05:38.047
What the hell is this?

05:39.841 --> 05:41.342
Iris isn't Iris.

05:48.099 --> 05:49.099
Okay, so then I thought, well,

05:49.100 --> 05:51.370
obviously this can't be
an Iris doppelgänger from another Earth,

05:51.394 --> 05:52.955
because doppelgängers
don't exist anymore,

05:52.979 --> 05:54.540
because the multi-verse
doesn't exist anymore,

05:54.564 --> 05:56.816
- because Crisis blew it all up, right?
- Uh-huh.

05:56.899 --> 05:58.526
Exactly. So, if that's true,

05:58.609 --> 06:00.629
who else do we know
that could be pretending to be Iris?

06:00.653 --> 06:02.488
- I... But...
- Shapeshifters.

06:02.697 --> 06:04.216
All right, so Everyman
was my first suspect.

06:04.240 --> 06:06.743
And Cisco's reports show
that he is alive, post-Crisis.

06:06.826 --> 06:09.829
Then, I remembered something
that Breacher said about Plastoids,

06:09.912 --> 06:10.955
which made me realize...

06:11.372 --> 06:13.583
there could be shapeshifting Martians
on this Earth now.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.502
This... This fake Iris doesn't even
have to be from our planet.

06:16.586 --> 06:17.670
But then, it hit me

06:17.754 --> 06:20.474
that J'onn J'onzz would sense
if there was a Martian hidden among us,

06:20.506 --> 06:21.549
so that was a dead end,

06:21.674 --> 06:23.676
but it led me
to my biggest breakthrough yet.

06:23.760 --> 06:24.761
Okay, Cecile.

06:25.094 --> 06:28.890
The night that this all started,
Iris left to investigate a story.

06:28.973 --> 06:32.810
I analyzed her phone's GPS, and it shows
that she went to McCulloch Tech.

06:34.062 --> 06:37.023
Cecile, I think that something happened
to Iris that night.

06:39.358 --> 06:40.358
Barry.

06:40.818 --> 06:43.780
All of this, is this the reason
you've been avoiding Iris?

06:43.863 --> 06:46.407
That's not Iris!
Okay, look, I didn't want to...

06:47.200 --> 06:49.535
tell anyone else about this
until I gathered more evidence,

06:49.619 --> 06:51.746
but now you know, so I...

06:53.039 --> 06:54.039
What do you think?

06:55.500 --> 06:56.458
Uh...

06:56.459 --> 07:00.129
What do I think? What do I think?
I think... I think that this sounds...

07:00.213 --> 07:02.215
I know how it sounds,
but look, we've seen crazier.

07:02.298 --> 07:04.068
We've seen crazier.
And look at all the clues.

07:04.092 --> 07:06.385
Okay, I mean, she speaks Italian,
all of a sudden.

07:06.469 --> 07:08.304
She smashed a bottle
over some guy's head.

07:08.387 --> 07:09.547
She made incredible pancakes.

07:10.223 --> 07:12.183
Cecile, trust me.
Iris can't make pancakes.

07:12.475 --> 07:14.602
All right? But the biggest clue was...

07:16.104 --> 07:17.271
her throwing me out.

07:18.689 --> 07:21.692
The real Iris would never
stop fighting for us.

07:23.653 --> 07:25.196
Okay. Okay, uh...

07:26.322 --> 07:30.618
Sweetie, do you think
that maybe, just maybe...

07:31.619 --> 07:33.329
you're feeling a little scared?

07:33.412 --> 07:35.957
You know, because your marriage
is going through a rough patch,

07:36.040 --> 07:40.753
and maybe what you need to do
is just go see Iris.

07:41.045 --> 07:43.047
That's not Ir... Cecile, look.

07:43.256 --> 07:45.296
Do you know why
my Speed Gauge is still glowing red?

07:46.175 --> 07:50.221
It is because the moment
that I stepped out of the loft,

07:50.429 --> 07:54.183
I realized Iris, the real Iris, my wife,

07:54.517 --> 07:57.937
she is somewhere else,
probably in danger.

07:58.187 --> 08:00.940
And if that's true,
I need my speed back,

08:01.023 --> 08:04.235
my lightning, all my powers,
if I'm gonna save her.

08:06.154 --> 08:07.714
It's all I've thought about ever since.

08:08.156 --> 08:11.200
No matter how insane this all sounds...

08:12.535 --> 08:17.915
I know in my heart that the real Iris
is out there somewhere,

08:18.416 --> 08:20.543
waiting for me to find her.

08:21.335 --> 08:22.670
I won't let her down.

08:30.845 --> 08:32.972
Polar bear's a little on-the-nose,
don't you think?

08:33.054 --> 08:34.283
Well, it's not like the stores have

08:34.307 --> 08:36.933
a "get well soon from
dual light-assassin attacks" card.

08:38.311 --> 08:39.227
What'd you bring?

08:39.227 --> 08:40.520
I got a mobile bio-lab,

08:40.605 --> 08:42.940
so she can catch up on her work
while she recovers in bed.

08:44.734 --> 08:46.360
Don't be jealous.
It's a scientist thing.

08:47.111 --> 08:48.779
Come on, snowpoke. It's us.

08:54.744 --> 08:55.912
It's ice-cold.

09:04.670 --> 09:05.670
Caitlin.

09:06.005 --> 09:07.465
Help me.

09:12.595 --> 09:14.075
Since when is Caitlin the frosty one?

09:18.684 --> 09:19.685
She's not.

09:21.854 --> 09:23.898
Hang on, Caitlin. We're on the case.

09:29.237 --> 09:32.281
I think I've come up with a new idea
to get us out of this place.

09:35.534 --> 09:38.287
Stop! What are you doing?

09:38.454 --> 09:39.454
Eva, think about it.

09:39.538 --> 09:41.374
This is the only mirror
that you can control,

09:41.707 --> 09:43.709
so there's gotta be something
different about it.

09:44.085 --> 09:48.881
And until we can figure out what that
is, we're just working blind. Move.

09:49.173 --> 09:52.176
So, to examine it, you want to smash it?

09:52.635 --> 09:55.596
Yeah. I mean, we both know
that you can put it back together,

09:55.846 --> 09:57.640
so let's just take this thing down,

09:57.723 --> 10:00.559
dissect it piece-by-piece,
and learn what its secrets are.

10:01.435 --> 10:04.480
Fine. You do what you wanna do.

10:07.316 --> 10:08.676
I'm gonna go to my lab,

10:08.776 --> 10:11.570
and work on a plan
that would actually help us.

10:45.521 --> 10:47.398
Oh, my God.

10:50.443 --> 10:52.445
Can you, uh, maybe hurry up?

10:52.528 --> 10:55.281
You know, when Iris gave me a spare key,
it was to water her plants.

10:55.364 --> 10:56.466
It wasn't to hack her computer.

10:56.490 --> 10:59.118
It's not hacking Iris' computer
if it's not really Iris.

10:59.327 --> 11:00.679
What are you even looking for, anyway?

11:00.703 --> 11:03.831
Anything that might be suspicious
from the past few weeks.

11:06.959 --> 11:08.753
- Bingo.
- What'd you find?

11:09.545 --> 11:10.545
This photo.

11:11.005 --> 11:12.506
It was deleted from Kamilla's camera,

11:12.590 --> 11:15.009
but not before it was uploaded
to <i>The Citizen's</i> cloud server.

11:15.092 --> 11:16.218
Do you see this text?

11:16.844 --> 11:18.471
"Prismatic Filter."

11:19.472 --> 11:20.472
What is that?

11:21.724 --> 11:24.810
It's the science that we're gonna use
to test our imposter's identity.

11:26.103 --> 11:27.313
Expose her for good.

11:38.240 --> 11:40.076
That's better. Much more homey.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.370
"Closer" is how I'd describe it.

11:43.079 --> 11:44.372
Closer to our Mother.

11:45.289 --> 11:47.041
It's time for our next move.

11:48.167 --> 11:50.294
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

11:51.712 --> 11:52.712
Are you?

11:54.799 --> 11:55.799
Yes.

11:57.134 --> 11:58.636
All that matters is Eva's will.

11:59.845 --> 12:01.972
We follow orders and assure her success.

12:02.348 --> 12:03.349
That's all I want.

12:04.058 --> 12:05.309
We need to focus.

12:05.643 --> 12:08.479
There's still one item Mother needs
to obtain for her liberation.

12:10.398 --> 12:11.678
<i>And it's the most dangerous yet.</i>

12:25.079 --> 12:26.399
Hey, I saw your text.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.874
I got here as fast as I could.
What's the emergency?

12:32.336 --> 12:34.046
You are, apparently.

12:39.760 --> 12:40.760
What's going on?

12:41.554 --> 12:43.931
You're not Iris. That's what.

12:44.390 --> 12:47.601
And you're not leaving here
until you tell us who or what you are.

12:52.314 --> 12:53.983
What the hell are you talking about?

12:56.485 --> 12:58.612
And why are you pointing
that gauntlet at me?

13:03.451 --> 13:05.953
This photo was taken on
Kamilla's camera.

13:06.537 --> 13:08.330
You see the prismatic fragmentation?

13:09.540 --> 13:11.041
Only your image is affected.

13:11.959 --> 13:15.546
I think that the camera's filter
is revealing a dimensional shift,

13:15.838 --> 13:18.674
showing us things in the picture
from another dimension.

13:19.633 --> 13:21.135
Things that don't belong in ours.

13:26.432 --> 13:28.058
Cecile, you actually believe this?

13:28.767 --> 13:32.813
You seemed off in your office earlier,
and that photo...

13:32.897 --> 13:35.608
That could have been anything!
A glitch in the camera tech.

13:35.774 --> 13:37.276
Guys, this is insane.

13:39.820 --> 13:43.782
This Prismatic Scanner is just a more
powerful version of the camera's filter.

13:44.992 --> 13:47.244
If I'm wrong,
and you are from this dimension,

13:47.328 --> 13:50.498
then when the prismatic wave hits you,
you'll look completely normal.

13:51.624 --> 13:55.544
But if I'm right,
you're gonna look just like that photo.

13:57.713 --> 14:00.049
And you're gonna tell us
where the real Iris is.

14:02.384 --> 14:04.094
Barry, how could you do this?

14:05.930 --> 14:07.806
For God's sake, I'm your wife.

14:20.861 --> 14:21.861
Okay.

14:23.322 --> 14:24.782
You wanna see who I really am?

14:26.784 --> 14:27.784
Fine.

14:29.370 --> 14:30.412
I'll show you.

15:11.161 --> 15:12.663
No.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.873
I have to know. I have to know.

15:20.254 --> 15:22.148
<i>Someone else must have heard
the good news, too,</i>

15:22.172 --> 15:23.465
<i>because they sent you a gift.</i>

15:23.549 --> 15:24.675
<i>I had it delivered.</i>

15:32.850 --> 15:34.143
<i>Hello, Joseph.</i>

15:34.935 --> 15:36.729
<i>This is your last chance, Joseph.</i>

15:36.812 --> 15:38.355
<i>Threats are for real people, Eva.</i>

15:39.148 --> 15:42.234
<i>Not phantoms.
Because that's what you are</i>.

15:46.614 --> 15:48.240
<i>And no one saw you?</i>

15:50.492 --> 15:53.012
- <i>Thank God you're safe.
- I'm not. Neither are you.</i>

15:53.412 --> 15:54.955
<i>Black Hole isn't what we think.</i>

15:56.290 --> 15:57.290
<i>Mirror.</i>

16:15.184 --> 16:16.185
Shh.

16:17.978 --> 16:18.978
I know.

16:21.273 --> 16:22.566
The truth hurts.

16:28.238 --> 16:29.239
Barry.

16:32.451 --> 16:35.829
I just want you to know
that if anything happens, I...

16:36.330 --> 16:37.539
I forgive you.

16:58.560 --> 16:59.687
What's happening?

17:01.605 --> 17:02.773
Nothing.

17:03.232 --> 17:05.067
Okay, okay. That's enough.

17:05.150 --> 17:06.502
No, something...
something's wrong, all right?

17:06.527 --> 17:07.727
Just... Just give it a minute.

17:13.367 --> 17:14.410
Look...

17:14.742 --> 17:15.953
I don't know how she did this,

17:16.036 --> 17:18.622
but you have to see
that this isn't my wife.

17:18.705 --> 17:20.082
No. You're not my husband, Barry.

17:22.334 --> 17:23.961
And you wanna know
what the real test is?

17:24.420 --> 17:27.673
The real Barry would have fought harder.
He would have fought to come back home.

17:28.173 --> 17:30.342
A whole week went by,
and you never even tried.

17:36.348 --> 17:38.600
You used to say
that I was your lightning rod.

17:40.060 --> 17:41.460
Now let's see if you're still mine.

18:09.256 --> 18:10.256
Guys...

18:13.594 --> 18:14.594
I'm me.

18:16.764 --> 18:18.764
I... I'm the real Barry.

18:18.807 --> 18:20.100
- Hey.
- Wait! Nash, no.

18:20.184 --> 18:21.852
Back up.

18:24.146 --> 18:25.146
Cecile.

18:30.819 --> 18:31.904
You believe me?

18:33.447 --> 18:34.948
Yes. I do.

18:41.663 --> 18:42.831
And I'm sorry.

18:47.044 --> 18:49.546
I'm sorry, Barry. I'm... I'm sorry.

19:00.516 --> 19:02.768
<i>Nash! Cecile!</i>

19:03.060 --> 19:05.145
<i>Don't listen to her. That's not Iris!</i>

19:05.646 --> 19:09.066
You know, you can stop playing this game
or rot in there, I don't care.

19:09.316 --> 19:11.527
Either way, I'm gonna find my husband.

19:12.778 --> 19:14.506
Ah, I should've noticed something.
I should've figured something out.

19:14.530 --> 19:16.130
- I should've...
- No. No one's to blame.

19:16.782 --> 19:19.618
He or it was pretty convincing.

19:19.701 --> 19:22.120
If that's not Barry, then what is he?

19:22.204 --> 19:25.624
He's like some mirror version
of himself.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.629
Guys, Joseph Carver.

19:32.714 --> 19:34.508
Wait. You think that...

19:34.591 --> 19:38.178
this is related to Black Hole
and their reflective-chip technology?

19:38.720 --> 19:39.720
Yeah.

19:40.848 --> 19:42.992
- I don't know. That seems almost...
- No, it's possible.

19:43.016 --> 19:46.019
I've seen the McCulloch tech up close,

19:46.103 --> 19:49.898
and reflective-chip technology,
it's far-reaching, to say the least.

19:52.693 --> 19:55.320
Okay. Well, um,
then this might be our best lead.

19:55.404 --> 19:57.614
Why don't you see what you can find,
Nash?

19:57.698 --> 20:01.034
I will regroup with Kamilla
and do some digging of our own.

20:04.371 --> 20:05.414
Are you okay, Cecile?

20:06.832 --> 20:07.832
Um...

20:08.041 --> 20:09.751
Yeah. No, um...

20:11.044 --> 20:13.881
Something just doesn't feel right.

20:18.385 --> 20:20.262
Yeah. No, I understand, um...

20:20.345 --> 20:21.823
But we're gonna get
to the bottom of this

20:21.847 --> 20:25.100
and get the real Barry back. I promise.

20:30.939 --> 20:33.358
Caitlin's body essentially
self-induced an ice coma

20:33.442 --> 20:34.610
to force her to hibernate.

20:34.693 --> 20:37.237
She's like a cold battery.
We just need to wake her up.

20:37.446 --> 20:38.614
That's where you come in.

20:38.822 --> 20:41.617
Since we don't have
any ionized conductive wiring,

20:41.867 --> 20:43.577
you'll have to be the jumper cables.

20:44.161 --> 20:45.161
Got it.

20:46.455 --> 20:47.455
Okay.

21:12.022 --> 21:13.523
Ralph, are you all right?

21:14.691 --> 21:15.691
Is she good?

21:19.321 --> 21:22.532
Cisco, is she okay? Did it work?

21:27.037 --> 21:28.037
Ah...

21:30.248 --> 21:31.458
Oh, thank Elsa.

21:33.877 --> 21:34.877
Welcome back.

21:35.671 --> 21:36.671
Thanks.

21:37.005 --> 21:38.358
You scared us for
a minute, there.

21:38.382 --> 21:39.382
Yeah.

21:39.883 --> 21:41.083
Can you tell us what happened?

21:41.176 --> 21:42.719
I was home alone,

21:42.886 --> 21:45.806
and the wound from the light bullet
was getting worse.

21:46.014 --> 21:47.825
I'm sure your run-in
with Sunshine didn't help.

21:47.849 --> 21:51.561
Yeah. So I tried to ice-heal it,
and that's when the wound ruptured.

21:52.312 --> 21:54.690
It must have been my immune system's
way of protecting me.

21:57.317 --> 22:00.070
- Guys, I need help.
- You just tell us what you need.

22:00.654 --> 22:06.034
I mean, who do we know who can help
with a light... ice wound?

22:06.660 --> 22:08.578
There's only one person we can call.

22:09.663 --> 22:10.914
My mother.

22:16.211 --> 22:17.337
Here she comes.

22:19.840 --> 22:21.200
Everything went according to plan?

22:21.258 --> 22:24.344
Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.
Everything went as planned.

22:26.471 --> 22:27.657
You guys go to the rendezvous.

22:27.681 --> 22:29.307
I'll handle this
and I'll meet you there.

22:39.651 --> 22:42.654
I've been watching Barry Allen.
He's planning on exposing you.

22:43.280 --> 22:46.366
- Tell me what to do.
- Go. Meet him.

22:46.992 --> 22:48.285
Leave the rest to me.

22:50.537 --> 22:51.621
You're not Iris.

22:52.205 --> 22:55.375
And you're not leaving here
until you tell us who or what you are.

23:01.131 --> 23:02.591
Now, let's get what we came for.

23:03.133 --> 23:04.652
One of the benefits
of being Chief of Police

23:04.676 --> 23:06.156
is I can request prisoner interviews.

23:06.553 --> 23:07.804
Even for press.

23:39.544 --> 23:43.632
Well, if it isn't Kamilla Hwang,
Chief Singh...

23:46.009 --> 23:48.220
and Iris West-Allen.

23:49.471 --> 23:50.931
To what do I owe the honor?

23:51.014 --> 23:52.933
If you help us,
we can get you out of there.

23:53.308 --> 23:55.477
And why would I trust
the wife of the Flash?

23:55.727 --> 23:58.897
Because I'm not Iris West-Allen.
I'm a reflection of her.

23:59.189 --> 24:00.982
We're all reflections.

24:01.066 --> 24:05.028
Faster, stronger than our human
counterparts whose faces we share.

24:05.445 --> 24:07.948
And our only will
is to serve our Mother.

24:14.579 --> 24:18.125
The real Iris would never
offer to release me.

24:18.875 --> 24:20.127
Tell me more about your Mother.

24:20.585 --> 24:22.295
Eva McCulloch. She was the sci...

24:22.420 --> 24:25.674
I am a scientist.
I know who Eva McCulloch is.

24:26.216 --> 24:27.717
But she disappeared years ago.

24:27.843 --> 24:31.471
She's been trapped in another dimension,
a mirror one,

24:31.972 --> 24:33.473
and she needs something from you.

24:34.015 --> 24:37.102
You need my blood. How grand.

24:37.310 --> 24:41.523
Even in here, fate continues to cast me
in the role of savior.

24:41.940 --> 24:42.941
We just need one drop.

24:44.067 --> 24:45.819
But you need to decide now.

24:52.534 --> 24:53.785
I accept.

24:53.869 --> 24:56.204
Release me, and you shall indeed
have my lifeblood.

24:56.872 --> 25:00.667
However, this is no crude
meta-cell in Iron Heights.

25:01.084 --> 25:02.502
How do you propose to disrupt

25:02.586 --> 25:06.464
a bio-degenerative containment matrix
with triplicate backup protocols?

25:06.590 --> 25:07.716
Mother has a theory.

25:08.884 --> 25:10.135
I am the answer.

25:11.428 --> 25:12.428
Wait.

25:15.348 --> 25:16.349
You'll die.

25:19.144 --> 25:20.353
Then it is Eva's will.

25:37.621 --> 25:41.041
Code zero. Facility-wide power failure,
all levels. Check the cells.

25:42.292 --> 25:44.211
We have 60 seconds
until the guards arrive...

26:09.027 --> 26:11.071
You're almost human...

26:12.405 --> 26:14.074
Maybe something more.

26:14.950 --> 26:17.244
You follow your Master Eva's will,

26:18.536 --> 26:21.665
but I see hesitation in your eyes.

26:22.165 --> 26:25.126
You have a modicum of will.

26:26.127 --> 26:28.505
Are you planning to trick me?

26:28.588 --> 26:29.756
Tell me now!

26:30.590 --> 26:33.843
What do you want?

26:33.927 --> 26:36.179
- Only Eva's will.
- Lies!

26:37.222 --> 26:38.265
Last chance.

26:39.140 --> 26:41.142
What do you want?

26:43.603 --> 26:45.397
To be alive.

26:49.693 --> 26:51.319
And you're worthy of it.

27:02.038 --> 27:05.208
<i>Power restored.
Cell containment re-initialized.</i>

27:05.292 --> 27:06.532
What are you doing?

27:07.669 --> 27:09.269
We had a plan. Don't you want to escape?

27:10.422 --> 27:14.718
There are walls beyond these walls.
I was never gonna just walk out of here.

27:16.011 --> 27:18.930
But there's more than one way
for me to be free.

27:19.764 --> 27:23.059
Let's just call this... the long game.

27:38.491 --> 27:39.491
Now, go.

27:39.784 --> 27:42.829
I'll stay here and cover our tracks.
Now.

27:48.168 --> 27:50.462
Run, Iris. Run!

28:10.440 --> 28:11.440
Cecile?

28:11.441 --> 28:13.276
I don't have all the facts...

28:13.360 --> 28:16.000
and the ones I do have tell me
that you're not who you say you are.

28:19.032 --> 28:22.327
But you are Barry.
I know it in my heart.

28:24.913 --> 28:26.956
And I'm willing to bet my life on it.

28:28.583 --> 28:30.001
Now go get Iris back.

28:37.008 --> 28:37.926
Good work.

28:37.927 --> 28:40.261
You'll apply Ramsey's blood
on your side of the mirror.

28:40.345 --> 28:43.723
Once it is fully absorbed,
I will activate the R-CEM on my side.

28:43.973 --> 28:46.601
Together, they will reconfigure
the molecular stability

28:46.684 --> 28:49.979
of the dimensional barrier
that burns organic matter,

28:50.063 --> 28:52.399
creating a safe passageway
between the two worlds.

28:53.108 --> 28:56.736
Next time I speak to you,
I will be standing right next to you...

28:58.905 --> 29:01.449
- liberated.
- Success is assured.

29:05.870 --> 29:07.372
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

29:11.376 --> 29:12.544
Where's my wife?

29:19.384 --> 29:21.803
I'll ask you one more time.
Where's my wife?

29:25.432 --> 29:26.432
What are you doing?

29:36.317 --> 29:39.863
I saw everything.
You targeted me from the very beginning.

29:39.946 --> 29:42.240
You suffered a fraction of my pain.

29:42.991 --> 29:46.453
But in just a few, I will be liberated.

29:46.995 --> 29:50.373
Barry is gonna stop you. We both will.

29:52.667 --> 29:55.086
I used to think my love
gives me strength, too.

29:55.712 --> 29:57.464
The mirror showed me the truth.

29:58.089 --> 29:59.632
Let me do the same for you.

30:27.035 --> 30:29.454
She says you're always
gonna be in her way...

30:30.246 --> 30:31.664
and now you're too slow to stop me.

30:31.748 --> 30:34.542
Whose way? Who is making you do this?

31:09.827 --> 31:11.663
You should really
mind your surroundings.

31:58.293 --> 31:59.752
Where's my wife?

32:00.086 --> 32:01.879
She's all you can think about, huh?

32:03.715 --> 32:06.342
What do you think about me, Barry?

32:07.719 --> 32:09.846
All those days...

32:10.972 --> 32:12.181
weeks.

32:12.765 --> 32:14.559
It wasn't her, it was me.

32:16.060 --> 32:17.687
Enjoying meals together.

32:20.440 --> 32:22.150
Talking about our day.

32:25.653 --> 32:28.239
- Sharing your bed.
- Shut up.

32:33.244 --> 32:34.871
I am going to kill you.

32:35.079 --> 32:39.500
Unlikely. I have been working
on this plan for half a decade.

32:39.751 --> 32:41.794
This is my creation.

32:42.003 --> 32:45.715
She is me and I am her.
What she feels, I feel...

32:45.798 --> 32:47.634
and we cannot lose.

32:53.306 --> 32:55.391
Do they feel what you feel for Carver?

32:56.893 --> 32:57.893
What?

32:58.811 --> 33:00.021
Do they still love him?

33:00.104 --> 33:03.149
I don't love my husband.
I want to end him.

33:03.274 --> 33:05.693
Then why do you still call him
your husband?

33:05.902 --> 33:08.655
You are just as blinded
as you were before,

33:08.821 --> 33:11.699
and he is going to trick you
in the exact same way.

33:11.866 --> 33:14.035
- Stop talking.
- Because you still love him.

33:14.118 --> 33:15.203
No, I don't!

33:28.800 --> 33:32.136
Your brilliant mind couldn't figure out
that he didn't care about you.

33:32.303 --> 33:33.221
Shut up!

33:38.685 --> 33:42.021
How long did you sit here, Eva,
pining for rescue...

33:42.105 --> 33:44.440
before you realized
that you had been abandoned?

33:44.607 --> 33:49.070
I hate him! I want him to suffer!
Suffer! Suffer!

33:49.904 --> 33:52.198
Suffer! Suffer!

33:52.573 --> 33:53.950
Suffer!

33:54.283 --> 33:56.411
Suffer! Suffer!

33:57.537 --> 33:58.537
Iris?

34:00.081 --> 34:02.417
Suffer! Suffer! Suffer!

34:02.583 --> 34:03.626
Suffer!

34:04.544 --> 34:05.670
Suffer.

34:08.005 --> 34:09.005
Iris.

34:10.882 --> 34:13.721
I won't fight you.
I won't fight you anymore.

34:16.389 --> 34:18.014
You were made from Iris.

34:21.686 --> 34:23.603
Part of her heart is inside you.

34:24.063 --> 34:25.565
I've seen you be kind.

34:25.648 --> 34:27.108
I've seen you laugh.

34:28.359 --> 34:30.110
I know that wasn't all a lie.

34:34.991 --> 34:36.617
You can be more than this.

34:40.121 --> 34:41.246
Not Iris...

34:42.915 --> 34:43.915
Yourself.

34:47.420 --> 34:48.588
You have to want it.

34:54.969 --> 34:55.969
No.

34:58.014 --> 34:59.557
You have to choose it.

35:07.190 --> 35:08.399
I choose me.

35:21.662 --> 35:22.997
Go find Iris.

35:24.373 --> 35:26.292
Go find her, Barry.

35:28.002 --> 35:29.002
Go save Iris.

35:31.339 --> 35:32.339
Go.

35:39.722 --> 35:41.057
Hey...

35:53.152 --> 35:54.152
Barry.

35:56.447 --> 35:57.740
I feel alive.

36:04.622 --> 36:06.082
I feel alive.

36:39.907 --> 36:41.909
Look what you made me do.

36:57.758 --> 36:59.176
No! I'm sorry!

37:01.387 --> 37:03.681
This didn't have to be like this, Flash.

37:05.600 --> 37:07.184
You don't know what it's like in there.

37:07.435 --> 37:08.895
I had to get out.

37:09.061 --> 37:10.061
Iris.

37:11.147 --> 37:12.063
Where...

37:12.064 --> 37:13.274
Where is she?

37:13.816 --> 37:15.735
She's still in the world
I left behind.

37:16.193 --> 37:18.029
Along with the rest
of my insurance policy,

37:18.112 --> 37:20.781
Chief Singh and your friend, Kamilla.

37:21.908 --> 37:24.911
They're safe. How long is up to you.

37:26.704 --> 37:28.664
So, what...

37:30.124 --> 37:31.334
now you're gonna kill me?

37:34.253 --> 37:35.755
There's no need for that.

37:37.381 --> 37:38.633
You're wounded.

37:39.967 --> 37:41.552
You lost your speed...

37:42.470 --> 37:44.555
and your healing
is not what it used to be.

37:45.723 --> 37:47.850
You're not much of a threat, are you?

37:50.895 --> 37:55.483
You just stay out of my way, Flash,
and I'll stay out of yours.

37:57.818 --> 38:00.571
I have unfinished business
to attend to...

38:05.242 --> 38:08.955
and a whole world to liberate.

38:42.655 --> 38:43.864
Thank God.

39:36.250 --> 39:37.501
Iris, I...

39:40.963 --> 39:43.632
I don't know if it's crazy to think
that you can hear me.

39:46.719 --> 39:48.888
I guess right now,
I just need to believe it.

39:56.353 --> 39:57.980
I miss you...

40:00.441 --> 40:01.734
so much.

40:29.512 --> 40:33.057
I know you probably can't hear me,
Barry, but...

40:35.976 --> 40:38.979
being away from you
hurts more and more every day.

40:44.276 --> 40:45.361
But I still have hope,

40:45.444 --> 40:49.949
because I know that you are out there,
fighting to get me back home.

40:52.034 --> 40:53.327
If you can hear me...

40:57.581 --> 40:59.875
I guess I just need you to know that...

41:01.919 --> 41:03.170
I love you.

41:07.800 --> 41:09.552
And that love is constant.

41:11.011 --> 41:12.346
Across dimensions...

41:14.640 --> 41:15.891
Across time.

41:19.019 --> 41:21.105
To the end of the world and back.

41:24.233 --> 41:25.693
And if I know you...

41:27.903 --> 41:31.031
I know you aren't just fighting
to find your own way home.

41:32.491 --> 41:34.577
And I'm gonna find Kamilla,

41:35.828 --> 41:37.288
and I'm gonna find Singh.

41:40.666 --> 41:42.042
But most of all...

41:43.419 --> 41:44.628
I'm gonna get you back.

41:44.712 --> 41:46.630
I'm gonna find my way back to you.
