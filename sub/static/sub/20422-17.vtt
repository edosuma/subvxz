WEBVTT

00:08.060 --> 00:09.250
Miss Nureha...

00:12.900 --> 00:14.770
Um, where are you going?

00:15.370 --> 00:17.470
Will you take an escort?

02:03.480 --> 02:05.610
You really saved us.

02:05.610 --> 02:08.920
I thought it was just boars, but then 
we were attacked by ogres.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.360
No need to thank us.

02:10.720 --> 02:12.910
We are adventurers.

02:13.300 --> 02:16.180
Of course we save people in trouble.

02:16.640 --> 02:18.110
I'm just glad you're safe.

02:18.820 --> 02:24.870
Of course, we were saved by that lady, though.

02:26.530 --> 02:30.630
I really can't take the sun...

02:30.670 --> 02:36.630
<b>Odyssey Knights</b>

02:32.950 --> 02:34.470
Odyssey Knights.

02:37.120 --> 02:39.760
How are you feeling, Roe 2?

02:40.100 --> 02:42.820
Sorry, can you close the curtains?

02:42.820 --> 02:44.470
I can't take the sun.

02:44.470 --> 02:45.360
Of course.

02:45.950 --> 02:46.780
Water?

02:47.170 --> 02:48.020
Thanks.

02:48.020 --> 02:48.820
Not at all.

02:53.460 --> 02:54.270
What is it?

02:54.270 --> 02:58.350
Nothing... Is that the Celestial Robe?

02:58.350 --> 03:00.560
Yeah. I'm impressed you know it.

03:00.560 --> 03:03.720
My teacher wears the same thing.

03:03.720 --> 03:05.410
Is he a caster, too?

03:05.730 --> 03:06.560
Yes.

03:06.560 --> 03:07.950
He's an enchanter.

03:07.950 --> 03:10.770
This robe's pretty high-end gear.

03:10.770 --> 03:13.890
It has wear-resistance and 
is good for normal use.

03:14.200 --> 03:15.420
It's perfect for long journeys.

03:15.870 --> 03:18.080
You sound just like Shiroe.

03:20.010 --> 03:23.960
Um... My teacher's name is Shiroe.

03:23.960 --> 03:26.610
You sort of remind me of him.

03:28.120 --> 03:31.910
So, you're a shrine priestess, and your 
subclass is apprentice, huh?

03:32.170 --> 03:32.780
Yes.

03:33.480 --> 03:34.540
Oh, right...

03:34.540 --> 03:35.510
I'll heal you.

03:35.510 --> 03:37.590
No, no need.

03:37.590 --> 03:38.360
But...

03:38.820 --> 03:41.050
My subclass is vampire.

03:42.570 --> 03:43.870
Oh, that's right...

03:44.100 --> 03:47.870
Vampires are damaged by healing spells.

03:47.870 --> 03:48.550
Yeah.

03:49.060 --> 03:50.870
I'm still tired.

03:51.340 --> 03:53.780
Um, what will you do now?

03:56.170 --> 03:58.840
Where did you come from, Roe 2?

04:00.290 --> 04:02.510
Where are you going?

04:02.970 --> 04:06.210
Where did I come from, and where am I going?

04:06.720 --> 04:09.020
A very philosophical question.

04:09.330 --> 04:11.520
No, that's not what I meant!

04:12.450 --> 04:13.600
I know.

04:17.410 --> 04:18.460
Minori...

04:18.460 --> 04:19.360
What's up?

04:19.360 --> 04:22.490
Well, you see, during the last battle...

04:23.000 --> 04:26.460
Croissant and Danish weren't hurt, but...

04:26.460 --> 04:27.580
It's broken.

04:28.030 --> 04:28.980
Oh, right.

04:28.980 --> 04:31.450
Items have wear bars, too...

04:31.450 --> 04:33.500
If we repair it, can we call them again?

04:33.500 --> 04:36.410
You'd need the woodworking skill.

04:36.410 --> 04:40.310
We were talking about pushing 
the carriage to the next town.

04:40.640 --> 04:43.590
It'd be really bad if more monsters appeared.

04:44.100 --> 04:48.070
So Tohya says we should escort 
the People of the Land.

04:48.070 --> 04:49.100
Understood.

04:51.780 --> 04:53.600
Why don't you get on the carriage, Rudy?

04:53.950 --> 04:56.860
A sorcerer has more strength than a bard.

04:56.860 --> 04:57.610
No.

04:58.150 --> 05:00.650
I wouldn't want to make a lady do my job.

05:02.140 --> 05:04.030
This is a big problem, though...

05:04.030 --> 05:08.170
Monsters that normally live at higher altitudes 
are coming down to the foothills.

05:08.170 --> 05:12.100
Yeah, they're all displacing each 
other's habitats, I'm sure.

05:12.760 --> 05:14.000
Really?

05:14.190 --> 05:18.060
There's a mountain area called 
Boxurt to the west, right?

05:18.060 --> 05:19.890
It has a pretty lake.

05:19.890 --> 05:21.710
There are nobles that rule it,

05:21.710 --> 05:24.010
but supposedly, monsters are 
showing up there, also.

05:24.280 --> 05:25.710
Boxurt?

05:25.710 --> 05:26.930
We're going through it, right?

05:26.930 --> 05:27.830
Yeah.

05:27.830 --> 05:29.260
Oh, you don't need to worry.

05:29.590 --> 05:32.620
The Odyssey Knights are over there now.

05:32.620 --> 05:33.620
Yeah, that's right.

05:33.620 --> 05:34.890
They're our heroes.

05:35.180 --> 05:37.580
They risk their lives to protect 
us from the monsters.

05:37.880 --> 05:39.400
Heroes?

05:40.110 --> 05:42.780
Maybe they're like D.D.D. or the Black Knights.

05:43.100 --> 05:43.990
Yeah.

05:44.510 --> 05:46.590
<i>Odyssey... That's...</i>

05:47.250 --> 05:48.240
They're a nostalgia faction,

05:49.220 --> 05:52.740
<b>Flavor Horizon
Szechuan-style mapo tofu with a sinful flavor</b>

05:49.410 --> 05:52.740
a group that wants to go home, 
sometimes called "Odyssey."

05:53.540 --> 05:56.870
Their goal is to go back to the real world.

05:57.320 --> 05:59.520
But sometimes they go too far

05:59.520 --> 06:02.020
and cause trouble.

06:04.180 --> 06:07.210
<i>But he didn't say they were knights.</i>

06:07.210 --> 06:08.790
<i>They may be someone different.</i>

06:10.280 --> 06:15.050

06:10.610 --> 06:12.830
You saved me!

06:12.830 --> 06:16.870
If I'd kept walking under the sun, 
I wouldn't have lasted.

06:16.870 --> 06:18.280
No, thank you.

06:18.630 --> 06:20.810
We helped each other out.

06:21.050 --> 06:22.500
Here's the food!

06:22.500 --> 06:24.890
The People of the Land are paying for it.

06:24.890 --> 06:26.440
They want to thank us.

06:26.630 --> 06:27.850
<b>Soy Sauce</b>

06:27.160 --> 06:28.220
I want soy sauce!

06:28.110 --> 06:30.450
<b>Worcestershire Sauce</b>

06:28.680 --> 06:29.980
I'll take Worcestershire sauce.

06:29.980 --> 06:30.850
Me, too.

06:30.740 --> 06:33.200
<b>Mayo</b>

06:31.610 --> 06:33.800
Mayo is the best!

06:34.980 --> 06:39.700
It's the cheap, everyday food 
that's the best in this world.

06:40.410 --> 06:45.170
Some adventurer, somewhere, 
came up with this egg bowl, right?

06:46.750 --> 06:49.740
This one's soy sauce, and 
that's Worcestershire sauce.

06:52.830 --> 06:54.580
She's using both?

06:54.580 --> 06:57.680
The issue of Worcestershire versus 
soy sauce is a complicated one.

06:58.490 --> 06:59.190
Okay!

06:59.540 --> 07:01.600
This thick, black one is Worcestershire sauce,

07:01.600 --> 07:03.690
and the thick, black one is soy sauce, right?

07:03.690 --> 07:04.700
Got it!

07:04.700 --> 07:06.690
The mayo is good, too.

07:07.110 --> 07:11.320
By the way, where were you 
before you came here, Roe 2?

07:11.320 --> 07:15.500
I came here from Oou. 
I left about three months ago.

07:15.500 --> 07:16.330
Oou?

07:16.790 --> 07:19.110
That's where Shiroe went on his expedition.

07:19.110 --> 07:22.580
Before that, I was someplace even farther away.

07:23.490 --> 07:25.210
I used castling to get there.

07:25.480 --> 07:26.750
Castling?

07:26.750 --> 07:27.960
Well...

07:28.360 --> 07:31.260
It's a special spell that lets you 
change places with a servant.

07:31.750 --> 07:34.180
Roe 2 is a summoner, after all.

07:34.180 --> 07:40.800
Lately, Eins's guild, Honesty, has been 
using it to investigate the fairy rings.

07:40.800 --> 07:43.470
You know all kinds of things, Minori!

07:44.130 --> 07:46.730
It's just something Shiroe told me...

07:47.270 --> 07:51.110
Which means you switched 
places with your servant?

07:51.810 --> 07:54.300
I don't know if "servant" or "brother" is best.

07:54.300 --> 07:56.550
I know... We'll go with "brother."

07:56.550 --> 07:58.120
I switched places with my brother.

07:58.600 --> 07:59.600
Your brother?

07:59.600 --> 08:01.850
I'm heading toward Ikoma for now.

08:01.850 --> 08:05.730
I can't get rid of this vampire 
subclass without going there.

08:05.730 --> 08:08.880
You can't take any quests to overwrite it, right?

08:09.440 --> 08:10.270
Yeah.

08:10.270 --> 08:12.100
I just have to drop it.

08:12.100 --> 08:15.150
Jeez, how did I end up with this subclass?

08:15.150 --> 08:16.890
I really want to ask the person in charge.

08:17.410 --> 08:19.490
It just changes your appearance!

08:19.490 --> 08:21.950
I mean, it's a little helpful on the moon,

08:21.950 --> 08:24.970
but I wish they'd think about what 
happens when you're on Earth!

08:24.970 --> 08:27.480
Anyway, I can't go on being a vampire!

08:28.260 --> 08:29.100
The moon?

08:30.640 --> 08:33.910
Ikoma's near Minami, right?

08:34.510 --> 08:36.780
What are we gonna do now, anyway?

08:38.140 --> 08:41.780
It looks like we can't repair our 
summon flute in this town.

08:41.780 --> 08:44.670
It'll be hard to go on without horses.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.040
Couldn't you just call some horses?

08:49.930 --> 08:52.380
You can call horses, Sis Roe 2?

08:54.100 --> 08:55.010
"Sis"?!

08:57.720 --> 08:58.460
Ahem.

08:58.880 --> 09:02.640
W-Would you call me "Sister"?

09:02.960 --> 09:03.720
Sister.

09:03.720 --> 09:05.050
Once more...

09:05.260 --> 09:06.050
Sister.

09:06.750 --> 09:07.600
You, too!

09:07.840 --> 09:09.150
Sister Roe 2...

09:10.380 --> 09:11.640
That's it!

09:11.640 --> 09:12.900
Sister!

09:13.110 --> 09:15.050
I love it... "Sister"!

09:15.050 --> 09:18.410
When someone calls me that, 
it feels like they're relying on me.

09:18.830 --> 09:22.160
I want to be someone who's 
treated like a big sister!

09:22.160 --> 09:24.410
I want to be loved for being a big sister!

09:26.110 --> 09:29.500
Okay, I'll accompany you on your 
journey, and give you horses.

09:29.820 --> 09:33.550
I'll summon you a whole stack of horses, 
better than anyone's ever seen!

09:34.260 --> 09:37.760
As payment, you'll let me act like a big sister.

09:38.180 --> 09:39.750
Got it, guys?

09:40.050 --> 09:41.770
O-Okay.

09:43.990 --> 09:46.270
I can't take the sun...

09:49.560 --> 09:51.150
The water is so nice.

09:51.150 --> 09:54.780
They say adventurers don't need baths, but...

09:55.090 --> 09:58.670
Our wounds heal fast, and we 
have self-cleaning functions,

09:58.670 --> 10:01.020
but it just doesn't feel right without baths, huh?

10:02.730 --> 10:03.810
Oh, yeah.

10:03.810 --> 10:07.400
I heard that Boxurt place 
we're going to is a big pain.

10:07.400 --> 10:08.650
Rudy was saying so.

10:08.650 --> 10:09.980
Really?

10:09.980 --> 10:12.170
Well, it's all part of the adventure.

10:12.450 --> 10:13.550
Hey!

10:13.940 --> 10:16.300
What's going on with you and Rudy?

10:16.890 --> 10:18.290
Going on?

10:18.290 --> 10:20.140
He's my puppy, and I go on walks with him.

10:20.140 --> 10:21.440
No way!

10:21.440 --> 10:23.560
You two totally seem like a couple.

10:23.980 --> 10:27.990
Then, what about you and Nyanta, Serara?

10:30.580 --> 10:33.230
Nyanta's teaching you all kinds of things, right?

10:33.230 --> 10:36.000
It's the stuff you'll need to 
know to get married, right?

10:36.890 --> 10:43.870
<i>Serara, I've got a Marriage Ring that took 
thirty raids and lots of delicious food.</i>

10:43.870 --> 10:46.580
<i>You're married to me now.</i>

10:48.020 --> 10:50.580
No! It isn't like that!

10:49.760 --> 10:50.580
Hey!

10:51.560 --> 10:52.980
I'm sorry!

10:52.980 --> 10:54.590
Jeez, Serara...

10:55.010 --> 10:58.700
If you act like that, Nyanta will get mad 
at you when you bathe together.

10:59.070 --> 11:00.340
Bathe together?!

11:00.780 --> 11:03.350
<i>Isn't the water nice, Serara?</i>

11:05.000 --> 11:05.830
So...

11:06.790 --> 11:09.950
How are things going with 
you and Shiroe, Minori?

11:10.670 --> 11:12.730
H-How are they going?

11:12.730 --> 11:15.170
There's nothing going on with him, really.

11:15.170 --> 11:17.850
It seems you have a lot of rivals for Shiroe...

11:19.110 --> 11:20.320
Really?

11:20.480 --> 11:24.200
I mean, he's the guy who founded the Round Table.

11:24.200 --> 11:27.910
Both Marielle and Henrietta are 
pretty, and friendly with him.

11:27.910 --> 11:30.580
And then there's the Tea Party's leader, too, right?

11:31.010 --> 11:33.000
And also, Akatsuki!

11:33.000 --> 11:36.460
<i>If you want to get close to my lord, 
you must defeat me first!</i>

11:38.130 --> 11:40.990
Come to think of it, isn't Roe 2 
wonderful, as well?

11:40.990 --> 11:44.340
No, no... <i>Sister</i> Roe 2.

11:45.210 --> 11:46.900
Wh-When did you get here?

11:47.660 --> 11:51.480
Since I'm the big sister, I have physical 
advantages over you guys.

11:51.860 --> 11:54.510
Of course, my boobs, too!

11:56.520 --> 11:58.880
Get a grip, girls.

11:58.880 --> 12:00.860
Breasts are just for show!

12:02.150 --> 12:04.840
Was that too much for my little sisters?

12:07.070 --> 12:08.030
Marie?

12:08.360 --> 12:09.680
You look glum.

12:09.680 --> 12:10.890
What's going on?

12:10.890 --> 12:14.730
I was wondering what to do for the spring event.

12:14.730 --> 12:16.840
The typical answer would be flower-viewing.

12:17.310 --> 12:18.480
Flower-viewing, huh?

12:18.680 --> 12:20.300
Yeah, you're right.

12:20.300 --> 12:21.670
That's a good idea.

12:21.670 --> 12:23.380
Everyone can enjoy it.

12:23.380 --> 12:26.720
And that might make everyone friends again.

12:27.160 --> 12:28.170
Marie...

12:29.220 --> 12:34.220
Is there really no way for people 
to be friendly and have fun together?

12:39.580 --> 12:44.490
And so, it hasn't been a major problem so far.

12:44.800 --> 12:45.680
Got it.

12:46.150 --> 12:48.050
Keep at it.

12:48.250 --> 12:49.520
Understood.

12:49.520 --> 12:56.280
But I think you should look at the encounter 
frequency in a bit more detail.

12:56.280 --> 12:57.350
You're right.

12:57.350 --> 12:58.000
Thanks.

13:00.650 --> 13:04.920
<b>Shiroe
Log Horizon (Guild Master)</b>

13:01.930 --> 13:02.970
Akatsuki?

13:02.970 --> 13:03.850
How do things look there?

13:04.260 --> 13:04.930
Yeah.

13:05.440 --> 13:08.430
Right now, nothing major is going on here.

13:08.770 --> 13:11.120
What about the old chief, my lord?

13:11.480 --> 13:12.870
Things seem okay.

13:13.320 --> 13:15.390
You keep at it, too, okay?

13:15.390 --> 13:16.080
Yeah.

13:16.080 --> 13:17.020
Leave it to me.

13:19.360 --> 13:21.600
You tired, Shiroe?

13:21.600 --> 13:23.700
It's too early for sighing.

13:24.160 --> 13:27.200
There are many problems to discuss, villain.

13:27.640 --> 13:28.780
Yeah.

13:30.190 --> 13:34.330
A major gap is quickly developing here in Akihabara.

13:35.020 --> 13:37.300
Those who can develop new 
technology or go hunting

13:37.300 --> 13:40.230
in the fields are getting richer and richer,

13:40.230 --> 13:44.070
and those who can't are spending the small 
amount of money they make just to live.

13:45.770 --> 13:47.450
That again?

13:47.450 --> 13:50.850
So, what are you trying to say 
is the cause of this gap?

13:51.270 --> 13:55.730
People learning the Teachings and the 
development of new items by crafters.

13:56.790 --> 13:58.750
Why are the Teachings a problem?

13:59.100 --> 14:01.360
Anyone can get one if they work hard.

14:01.950 --> 14:04.110
That isn't the issue.

14:04.610 --> 14:08.370
The large guilds are using their manpower 
to expand their businesses.

14:08.830 --> 14:11.870
We should work to prevent anyone 
from establishing a monopoly.

14:12.260 --> 14:14.300
That's quite the accusation.

14:14.300 --> 14:17.990
Honesty's no different, in terms of scale.

14:17.990 --> 14:19.790
We don't do that.

14:20.260 --> 14:21.900
And we haven't gained any Teachings.

14:22.300 --> 14:25.850
The Teachings that each guild has 
learned should be made public.

14:26.350 --> 14:27.630
The same with crafting recipes—

14:27.630 --> 14:28.500
Hey!

14:28.770 --> 14:31.010
That's going too far.

14:31.010 --> 14:32.700
That's right.

14:32.700 --> 14:36.950
Since the Apocalypse, making items has 
been a process of trial and error...

14:36.950 --> 14:41.020
The ramen, soup, figures, the custom carriages.

14:41.020 --> 14:43.900
Each of those represents a huge time 
investment by a craftsman.

14:44.230 --> 14:46.870
The Teachings can only be used by the person

14:46.870 --> 14:50.670
who gained them, so even if we make 
them public, there's no point.

14:51.100 --> 14:52.230
I see.

14:52.600 --> 14:56.990
Then why don't we confiscate any bank accounts

14:56.990 --> 14:58.540
above 80,000 gold,

14:58.540 --> 15:02.470
and redistribute it to adventurers 
with the fewest assets?

15:02.900 --> 15:05.170
That would help the income gap.

15:05.430 --> 15:06.800
That's insane.

15:07.980 --> 15:10.420
The money, the Teachings, the recipes...

15:10.420 --> 15:13.870
They all belong to the people who 
worked hard to get them.

15:14.320 --> 15:16.060
If we take them, it'd be a huge deal.

15:16.590 --> 15:18.000
You know that, don't you?

15:18.390 --> 15:22.060
But there are people who 
can't adapt to this society.

15:22.490 --> 15:24.730
Are we just going to abandon them?

15:25.030 --> 15:28.110
That's why we've been holding all these events,

15:28.110 --> 15:31.070
to try and make it easier for people 
to participate, I thought...

15:31.450 --> 15:34.910
That arrogance just keeps them further away.

15:34.910 --> 15:35.580
Hey.

15:36.030 --> 15:39.830
I w-wasn't trying to be like that.

15:40.190 --> 15:41.920
I just...

15:42.300 --> 15:45.590
If we give these people money and recipes,

15:45.590 --> 15:47.600
will they start working hard and happily?

15:47.860 --> 15:48.900
Well...

15:49.160 --> 15:52.830
But we cannot just leave them.

15:52.830 --> 15:55.720
If you force people to publicize 
their crafting recipes,

15:55.720 --> 15:58.250
that would hurt the engineers' motivation.

15:58.250 --> 16:01.350
Whenever you're making a recipe, 
it's a lot of hard work before it's done.

16:00.430 --> 16:03.800
<i>If only Crusty were here at a time like this...</i>

16:04.780 --> 16:06.110
Don't be ridiculous.

16:07.760 --> 16:09.500
I understand your proposal.

16:10.290 --> 16:12.830
And I think some kind of action is necessary.

16:13.490 --> 16:16.620
But the Round Table has a finite budget.

16:17.210 --> 16:21.620
We aren't getting money from 
the nobles like Minami.

16:23.410 --> 16:26.630
Let's all see what we can come up with.

16:27.060 --> 16:29.800
But if it becomes too late...

16:29.800 --> 16:31.250
There's no point in doing this anymore.

16:32.330 --> 16:34.160
If we make a huge decision

16:34.160 --> 16:36.640
like that just among ourselves,

16:37.070 --> 16:38.780
it could destroy Akihabara.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.760
<b>Boxurt Mountains

16:41.900 --> 16:46.650
Thanks to Sis Roe 2's horses, 
we made it into the Boxurt Mountains,

16:47.060 --> 16:48.850
but this path is a mess!

16:48.850 --> 16:52.150
Um, in the old world, this was Hakone.

16:52.650 --> 16:55.390
Hakone was originally a volcano.

16:55.390 --> 16:56.950
Should I go on ahead?

16:56.950 --> 17:00.080
Visibility is low, and if there are any 
obstacles in our way, it'll be dangerous.

17:00.080 --> 17:00.910
Yeah.

17:02.430 --> 17:03.920
Sulfur, huh?

17:04.310 --> 17:05.410
Wait.

17:05.410 --> 17:06.560
I'll go, too.

17:06.560 --> 17:08.670
I'll summon you some servants.

17:09.080 --> 17:12.170
After all, I'm your big sister.

17:12.380 --> 17:13.440
Servants?

17:14.940 --> 17:16.960
Wh-What the?!

17:16.960 --> 17:18.180
I'll pass...

17:18.570 --> 17:20.740
Then take Wolfie!

17:22.170 --> 17:24.020
Thanks, both of you.

17:24.360 --> 17:25.690
Let's get going, then.

17:28.880 --> 17:31.450
The sulfur really stinks...

17:31.450 --> 17:35.480
I told you Boxurt wasn't going to be easy.

17:36.180 --> 17:39.170
But the fog's thicker than when 
I last came through here.

17:41.920 --> 17:43.460
Looks like trouble.

17:43.780 --> 17:45.820
We've still got quite a few...

17:45.820 --> 17:46.830
You guys in trouble?

17:47.620 --> 17:49.310
Are you adventurers?

17:49.310 --> 17:50.500
Want to buy some swords?

17:50.500 --> 17:52.310
We have some from levels 10 to 15.

17:52.310 --> 17:53.790
They're real treasures, made in Akihabara!

17:53.790 --> 17:56.610
No, our levels are higher than that.

17:56.610 --> 17:57.680
Anyway, what's going on?

17:57.920 --> 18:00.320
One of our carriages broke.

18:00.320 --> 18:03.340
Then push the broken one into the ravine,

18:03.340 --> 18:05.960
and pile all you can into the second.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.690
I don't want to throw away our cargo.

18:07.950 --> 18:10.700
Would you guys buy them all?

18:10.700 --> 18:11.820
That'd be great.

18:11.820 --> 18:13.690
You two together could afford them, right?

18:14.130 --> 18:15.860
That's crazy.

18:15.860 --> 18:18.200
I'd love to help, but...

18:19.060 --> 18:21.070
Forgive them, travelers.

18:22.270 --> 18:26.580

a whole day and night here.

<b>Dariella/ Chronicler</b>

18:26.970 --> 18:29.250

Oh, um...

18:32.040 --> 18:36.870
I'm Dariella. I'm a traveling writer. 
A Person of the Land.

18:36.870 --> 18:38.330
Hello, lady.

18:38.330 --> 18:40.070
I'm Rundel Haus Code.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.550
He's Tohya.

18:41.550 --> 18:43.040
We're adventurers from Akihabara.

18:43.040 --> 18:45.020
Oh, my. From Akihabara?

18:45.390 --> 18:50.270
Would you be willing to carry some of 
these boxes to the fortress ahead?

18:50.790 --> 18:55.860
It would really help the merchants 
if adventurers were to aid them.

18:58.340 --> 19:01.530
It's amazing how strong you are, 
with those thin arms!

19:01.770 --> 19:03.800
Um, Igarashi?

19:03.800 --> 19:05.210
It's Isuzu.

19:05.210 --> 19:09.920
Um, this box is filled with goat slimes...

19:10.940 --> 19:13.970
Some weird guy in Akihabara made us take them.

19:17.700 --> 19:21.260
They ate really fast and passed right out!

19:21.260 --> 19:25.430
They spent a whole night on 
a mountain with monsters.

19:25.430 --> 19:27.440
Of course they're exhausted.

19:28.590 --> 19:31.570
Are you one of the merchants' wives?

19:31.570 --> 19:36.710
No, I was just riding back to 
Minami on their carriage.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.450
Minami is the same direction as Ikoma, huh?

19:40.880 --> 19:41.680
Yes.

19:41.680 --> 19:45.440
Everyone, how about some after-meal tea?

19:45.440 --> 19:46.830
We have snacks, too.

19:47.810 --> 19:48.830
Snacks!

19:50.580 --> 19:53.340
These are Nyanta's special cookies!

19:54.270 --> 19:55.420
How are they?

19:55.750 --> 19:56.730
They're sweet.

19:57.020 --> 19:58.210
They're very good.

20:00.830 --> 20:02.720
Where are you all going?

20:03.320 --> 20:05.010
The Redstone Mountains.

20:05.010 --> 20:08.830
I'm heading to Ikoma, but I'm 
going that far with them.

20:09.130 --> 20:10.480
Because I'm their big sister!

20:10.900 --> 20:12.240
Big sister...

20:12.580 --> 20:15.480
You all certainly are young.

20:16.010 --> 20:18.490
Our goal is just beyond the pass.

20:18.980 --> 20:19.800
Yes.

20:20.240 --> 20:25.250
But Shiroe said there might be wyverns here...

20:26.370 --> 20:29.340
Wyverns are flying monsters, right?

20:29.340 --> 20:32.270
Their range is spreading.

20:32.270 --> 20:35.720
As are those of the ogres and other monsters.

20:39.520 --> 20:40.670
What's that sound?

20:40.920 --> 20:43.390
Something doesn't feel right, somehow...

20:43.780 --> 20:45.260
It's coming closer!

20:51.920 --> 20:53.580
A raid team?

20:53.580 --> 20:55.400
They're with

20:56.290 --> 20:57.610
Plant Hwyaden.

20:57.850 --> 20:58.900

<b>Shunichi

20:59.910 --> 21:01.620
He's level 90.

21:01.620 --> 21:03.410
So are the others.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.900
They don't look like PKs.

21:06.900 --> 21:10.050
They're probably the Odyssey Knights.

21:11.170 --> 21:14.120
The ones protecting the People of the Land?

21:14.120 --> 21:14.980
Yes.

21:16.130 --> 21:18.450
What's that thing they're carrying?

21:18.770 --> 21:20.980
It's the Mobile Temple of Boreas.

21:19.150 --> 21:22.910
<b>The Mobile Temple of Boreas</b>

21:21.420 --> 21:22.920
The Mobile Temple?

21:23.120 --> 21:26.180
I only heard about it on my travels,

21:26.490 --> 21:30.930
but the Odyssey Knights are taking 
them all across the land.

21:31.760 --> 21:36.190
It immediately revives any adventurer 
who loses their life in its vicinity.

21:36.830 --> 21:41.190
With that temple, they can revive 
anywhere and at any time.

21:41.450 --> 21:43.500
An instant Cathedral.

21:43.500 --> 21:46.750
So the Minami adventurers invented that?

21:47.020 --> 21:49.850
But they look so lifeless.

21:50.620 --> 21:52.240
It's like a funeral procession.

21:52.670 --> 21:54.620
It lets you revive anywhere.

21:54.930 --> 21:57.470
And I don't know if it's a side effect of that,

21:57.470 --> 22:00.550
but I'm told it disturbs the voices 
of adventurers' hearts.

22:01.650 --> 22:03.370
The voices of their hearts?

22:04.420 --> 22:10.510
Even so, that temple is something 
important to you adventurers, right?

24:05.670 --> 24:07.880
On their journey, they stop at the town of Safil.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.090
There, Isuzu performs a concert.

24:10.330 --> 24:13.780
Her melodies entrance the People of the Land.

24:13.780 --> 24:17.990
Isuzu is happy and exhausted 
when Rudy shares with her

24:18.360 --> 24:21.980
the secrets of this world's music and the 
People of the Land's dream.

24:22.730 --> 24:24.840
Next time: When the Concert Ends.

24:22.730 --> 24:29.940
<b>When the Concert Ends</b>

24:25.330 --> 24:26.850
