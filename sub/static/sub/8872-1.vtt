12:45.683 --> 12:50.004
How? I fired the dead weight
and brought in cheap zombie labor.

12:50.104 --> 12:53.190
Why? Because I came here to win.

12:53.691 --> 12:55.301
Out of the 25 boys seated here today

12:55.401 --> 12:59.697
23 of you will go on to lead
completely inconsequential lives.

12:59.864 --> 13:01.807
For the other two boys,
it'll be a different journey.

13:01.907 --> 13:04.910
One of them will just drop dead
for no reason. Poof. Nobody knows why.

13:05.035 --> 13:08.022
Heart attack, aneurysm,
stabbed in the heart in a mall parking lot.

13:08.122 --> 13:09.373
Bang, gone.

13:09.540 --> 13:12.543
But the other boy,
whoever that chosen boy is,

13:12.710 --> 13:16.589
he will be a shining fucking star like me.

13:17.047 --> 13:19.258
- This guy.
- He's so amazing.

13:20.885 --> 13:23.045
- Strike three!
- MAN: Let's go, let's put one in play.

13:23.262 --> 13:24.982
Wow. Parker's got a rocket
for an arm, huh?

13:25.097 --> 13:28.542
Yeah. The best I've ever seen.
Too bad he's shit under pressure.

13:28.642 --> 13:30.060
BOY 1: All right, let's go!

13:30.728 --> 13:32.528
- It's on.
- BOY 2: Come on, put one in there.

13:37.735 --> 13:40.988
PARMINDER: Come on, man. Damn it. Dick.

13:42.740 --> 13:45.910
Pay attention, Lor.
I'm about to teach this bitch a lesson.

13:46.243 --> 13:48.662
Teach him gently, baby.
That boy's my neighbor.

13:51.248 --> 13:54.293
Okay, nice boy, bring the cheese home.

13:54.418 --> 13:57.755
It better be Swiss because I'm holy, baby.
I'm holy, baby.

13:58.255 --> 13:59.975
BOY 3: Looking good, Dag.
Looking good, man.

14:00.674 --> 14:01.967
MAN: Find the zone, Dag!

14:02.092 --> 14:03.093
(EXHALES)

14:04.261 --> 14:05.471
I'm going to rape you.

14:19.443 --> 14:20.486
(GRUNTS)

14:20.986 --> 14:22.096
- (GROANS)
- (ALL EXCLAIMING)

14:22.196 --> 14:23.322
- Oh, Jesus.
- (GASPS)

14:23.489 --> 14:25.266
- PULCIFER: Oh, my God. Say something.
- (LAUGHS)

14:25.366 --> 14:26.784
Dag, what did you do?

14:27.117 --> 14:30.120
Are you okay? Oh, gosh.
Okay, we need to get him ice.

14:30.287 --> 14:31.455
- Dag!
- (CHAZ JR. SCREAMING)

14:32.122 --> 14:35.609
PULCIFER: Oh, my God! Okay, okay!
Okay, okay! Okay, okay!

14:35.709 --> 14:38.229
- It's going to be okay.
- CHAZ JR.: Rick, I'm still number one!

14:38.963 --> 14:40.005
(ALL CHEERING)

14:40.130 --> 14:41.782
BOY 1: Yeah! All right.

14:41.882 --> 14:43.701
(ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING)

14:43.801 --> 14:46.303
- BOY 2: I went out and got wrecked.
- It's in the car.

14:55.646 --> 14:57.898
- Wait, should we go back to the party?
- No.

14:59.316 --> 15:00.426
I'm great right here.

15:00.526 --> 15:01.819
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

15:05.030 --> 15:06.198
Wait.

15:07.241 --> 15:09.076
Is it going to hurt?

15:09.493 --> 15:11.245
A little, at first.

15:12.496 --> 15:14.206
But then ecstasy.

15:14.707 --> 15:15.874
Yeah?

15:22.006 --> 15:23.616
(SHRIEKS)

15:23.716 --> 15:26.385
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean, what am I doing?

15:28.387 --> 15:30.187
You said you wanted to go all the way
with me.

15:31.599 --> 15:33.434
I thought you meant sex, not that.

15:38.188 --> 15:39.565
Are you kidding me?

15:41.066 --> 15:42.401
I thought you were cool, Petra.

15:45.696 --> 15:46.864
(SIGHS)

15:48.365 --> 15:50.618
But why don't you want to be with me
my way?

15:52.244 --> 15:54.038
I already went down
that road with Lorelei.

15:55.873 --> 15:57.441
You slept with Lorelei?

15:57.541 --> 16:01.211
Don't you get it?
Lorelei had me for 17 minutes.

16:02.880 --> 16:04.423
I'm offering you forever.

16:05.716 --> 16:07.701
Do you really mean that?

16:07.801 --> 16:11.430
Do you have any idea
how long I've waited for a girl like you?

16:16.477 --> 16:17.811
Centuries.

16:17.936 --> 16:20.022
(GIRL WHOOPING)

16:35.913 --> 16:37.189
Honey, you're staring again.

16:37.289 --> 16:39.483
The doctor said it would be off
in a year or two, tops.

16:39.583 --> 16:43.170
Two years?
If you were a dog, I would put you down.

16:44.838 --> 16:47.758
Out of love and kindness. A mercy kill.

16:48.175 --> 16:51.303
Do you not get it? You've got nothing
to live for. This is what you had.

16:51.929 --> 16:53.681
- His life is over.
- Okay.

16:53.931 --> 16:56.684
He's not a creature of the mind.
He's physical.

16:57.267 --> 16:59.978
We're done. We're done, God, you hear me?

17:00.604 --> 17:01.855
We're done.

17:03.190 --> 17:06.050
I know you're probably thinking
about killing yourself. I don't blame you.

17:06.151 --> 17:09.351
But don't do it because you might get
better. If you don't get better, go for it.

17:10.114 --> 17:11.656
May I be excused, Mom?

17:11.824 --> 17:13.601
Uh, honey, I know that you're upset
about Chaz Jr.

17:13.701 --> 17:17.371
But it's important that we stay together
as a family right now.

17:18.122 --> 17:19.623
I didn't say I was upset about Chaz.

17:20.374 --> 17:22.376
Mr. Keller gave me an F on my paper today.

17:22.960 --> 17:27.239
Whoa. Nerd Boy's getting F's
and hanging out with zombies.

17:27.339 --> 17:28.449
Zombies?

17:28.549 --> 17:31.410
I wasn't hanging with zombies.
She was just helping me with my gazpacho.

17:31.510 --> 17:33.637
Why can't you just eat a riblet
like everyone else?

17:33.804 --> 17:37.975
For the millionth time, I'm allergic. Besides,
do you have any idea what's in a riblet?

17:38.142 --> 17:42.463
- Tiny ribs.
- Hormones, stimulants, tetrafluoraxipan.

17:42.563 --> 17:45.566
It's a chemical compound
otherwise known as TXP.

17:45.733 --> 17:49.887
Okay, Mr. Wizard, enlighten us.
What's so bad about TXP?

17:49.987 --> 17:51.972
- Leading cause of liver failure.
- Who cares?

17:52.072 --> 17:53.807
- Prenatal scoliosis.
- So what?

17:53.907 --> 17:56.226
- Diabetes.
- Doesn't matter.

17:56.326 --> 17:58.145
Pain in the ankles.

17:58.245 --> 18:00.147
Yeah, that would be hard
for sports and whatnot, yeah.

18:00.247 --> 18:01.999
- Also, puff tongue!
- Puff tongue?

18:02.166 --> 18:03.400
- Yeah, puff tongue.
- Puff tongue?

18:03.500 --> 18:04.610
- Puff tongue.
- Pfft.

18:04.710 --> 18:06.612
Oh, oh, oh. How terrible.

18:06.712 --> 18:09.923
Just think of all those little kids
with puffy tongues. What?

18:12.009 --> 18:15.829
If this TXP stuff was really so unhealthy

18:15.929 --> 18:18.457
they wouldn't put it in the riblets,
now would they?

18:18.557 --> 18:21.018
It's what Saturn is made of.
Do you know Saturn?

18:21.185 --> 18:23.187
I know Saturn, a classy economy car.

18:24.188 --> 18:27.441
I'm so sorry about the F, honey.
You'll get them next time.

18:27.566 --> 18:30.402
There's no next time. Do you know
what an F does to my transcript?

18:30.527 --> 18:31.570
No.

18:31.695 --> 18:34.698
- I can kiss my scholarship goodbye.
- You can kiss college goodbye.

18:35.032 --> 18:36.141
What?

18:36.241 --> 18:38.936
I'm sorry, but let's cut the shit, people.
We're in deep trouble here.

18:39.036 --> 18:40.956
Do you have any idea
how much this crapola costs?

18:41.288 --> 18:44.583
- Doesn't insurance cover that?
- Insurance is for suckers, Ned.

18:44.708 --> 18:47.945
From now on, when you're not in school,
I'm going to need you down at the car lot.

18:48.045 --> 18:50.197
Dad, dickbag gets to sell Hyundais
and I don't?

18:50.297 --> 18:53.091
Oh, I think that's a fantastic idea.

18:53.217 --> 18:55.636
- I'm going to my room.
- This one.

18:58.555 --> 19:01.395
Why do you think he left the room?
It's because he doesn't want to talk.

19:02.559 --> 19:03.894
Do you got a minute?

19:08.941 --> 19:13.737
Ned, listen, I know that at times it seems
like it's awkward between you and I.

19:14.613 --> 19:17.741
I'm excited that the two of us are going
to get to spend more time together.

19:18.575 --> 19:20.327
- You don't mean that.
- Yes, he does.

19:20.577 --> 19:22.479
Yeah. I do. I really do.

19:22.579 --> 19:24.898
I mean, if you want,
you can start coming to competitions.

19:24.998 --> 19:27.359
There's Mathletes on Saturday
and then there's Odyssey of the Mind.

19:27.459 --> 19:29.862
And there's father-son NASA,
which I think that you would really like.

19:29.962 --> 19:33.465
No, no, no. You're overthinking this.
You overthink everything.

19:33.590 --> 19:35.509
Maybe just the father-son NASA.
You don't have to...

19:35.634 --> 19:38.829
Look, right now
I need you down at the lot.

19:38.929 --> 19:40.748
With the extra hours, if we're lucky

19:40.848 --> 19:43.433
maybe Jr.'s dream of making the pros
still has a chance.

19:43.934 --> 19:45.269
What about my dreams?

19:48.605 --> 19:49.857
What dreams?

19:50.649 --> 19:53.151
Uh, well, for starters,
I want to be an engineer someday.

19:53.277 --> 19:57.014
Son, how many times do we have to
go over this? No one rides trains anymore!

19:57.114 --> 19:58.932
You gotta stop living in the clouds
and get real.

19:59.032 --> 20:02.828
If it's not the lot, you can work at the riblet
plant, be a meat bleacher like your mom.

20:02.953 --> 20:06.106
I did 10 years on the ammonia hose
and I regret nothing.

20:06.206 --> 20:10.794
I don't want to work the ammonia hose
or be a stupid freaking Hyundai salesman.

20:11.461 --> 20:14.072
Whoa! Slow your roll, tiger.
Leave the Hyundai Corporation out of this.

20:14.172 --> 20:17.509
Stop telling me to slow my roll!
Chaz Jr. doesn't have to slow his roll!

20:17.634 --> 20:19.787
How come I'm the only one around here
who has to slow his roll?

20:19.887 --> 20:22.848
Listen, I understand we're all upset
about Chaz Jr.

20:22.973 --> 20:24.683
- Fuck Chaz Jr.
- Fuck Chaz Jr.?

20:24.808 --> 20:27.686
- Yeah. Fuck Chaz Jr.
- Nobody fucks Chaz Jr.!

20:28.562 --> 20:30.022
MRS. MOSELY: Ned, don't go! Chaz!

20:30.147 --> 20:33.692
Don't point your finger at us!
Point it at your old friend, Dag!

20:33.817 --> 20:37.487
He's the one who threw that pitch!
He's the one who ruined our lives!

20:47.706 --> 20:49.483
Hmm. Mmm.

20:49.583 --> 20:51.919
I just love your waterbed. (CHUCKLES)

20:52.669 --> 20:54.171
It's the best.

20:55.839 --> 20:58.592
- You know, I'm surprised you're still around.
- What do you mean?

20:59.176 --> 21:01.887
I mean that stunt you pulled today
on the baseball field.

21:02.679 --> 21:07.017
We were all set to win State
and Chaz Jr. was going to get scouted.

21:07.851 --> 21:08.919
Yeah.

21:09.019 --> 21:11.021
What were you thinking?

21:11.855 --> 21:14.007
I don't know. I guess...

21:14.107 --> 21:16.401
I sort of... I wanted to...

21:18.528 --> 21:19.863
Like, impress you.

21:20.697 --> 21:22.449
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:23.700 --> 21:24.868
That's so sweet.

21:27.454 --> 21:30.540
- Why would you want to impress me?
- What?

21:31.917 --> 21:36.880
I said, why would you want to impress me?

21:40.217 --> 21:41.593
Lorelei,

21:42.970 --> 21:44.763
I think I might be in love with you.

21:46.890 --> 21:48.058
(LAUGHS)

21:49.434 --> 21:53.397
Dag, you are the weirdest,
funniest boy I know.

21:54.147 --> 21:55.883
I don't know what I would do without you.

21:55.983 --> 21:57.484
- (GIGGLES)
- (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

22:00.445 --> 22:01.613
(GROANS)

22:02.239 --> 22:04.950
- Sweetheart, you know I'm saving myself.
- (KNOCKING ON DOOR)

22:05.993 --> 22:07.661
DAG: Be right there.

22:08.245 --> 22:09.788
Are you leaving?

22:09.913 --> 22:12.582
Yeah, all this talking about sex
is making me really hungry. So...

22:12.958 --> 22:15.027
- Yeah. Me, too.
- I'm going to go to Burger King.

22:15.127 --> 22:16.236
Yeah, a Whopper sounds good.

22:16.336 --> 22:17.529
- Right?
- Yeah, let's do it.

22:17.629 --> 22:18.989
- I'll smell you later.
- Okay.

22:19.089 --> 22:20.340
(KNOCKING CONTINUES)

22:20.507 --> 22:21.675
Yeah?

22:23.677 --> 22:24.761
Ah...

22:27.431 --> 22:28.415
Uh...

22:28.515 --> 22:29.641
Oh. (CLEARS THROAT)

22:34.146 --> 22:35.272
(CLEARS THROAT)

22:38.442 --> 22:42.362
Dag, your mother and I
don't want to encourage pot smoking.

22:42.487 --> 22:46.491
But we want you to know that

22:46.616 --> 22:49.286
we completely understand it.

22:50.162 --> 22:51.897
- It's actually not my weed.
- Very good.

22:51.997 --> 22:53.957
- Okay. Well, Dag...
- We get it.

22:54.541 --> 22:58.570
That's what we're saying.
It's Lorelei's and if it wasn't

22:58.670 --> 23:00.614
well, whatever, whatever, whatever.

23:00.714 --> 23:03.175
Okay, thank you for being
so understanding,

23:03.300 --> 23:06.219
but in this case
you're not understanding correctly.

23:06.386 --> 23:10.707
Okay. Your mother and I understand
what you're saying.

23:10.807 --> 23:14.144
It's hard to express
how much we understand

23:14.311 --> 23:16.021
on a daily basis.

23:16.229 --> 23:21.468
Really. Like, even 15 minutes ago,
we totally understood.

23:21.568 --> 23:22.694
- We got it.
- Really?

23:22.819 --> 23:24.721
I didn't know that you
understood that much.

23:24.821 --> 23:26.656
- (COUGHS) Twice a day, at least.
- PEG: Well, whenever.

23:26.823 --> 23:29.476
We're on an understanding plane.

23:29.576 --> 23:31.645
- Look at that. Look at that.
- It's like an ice skating rink.

23:31.745 --> 23:34.664
- Look at this. I'm getting trails.
- PEG: Wow.

23:35.207 --> 23:38.735
Mom, is there anything else
you wanted to talk about?

23:38.835 --> 23:40.045
- No.
- No.

23:40.253 --> 23:41.279
Oh. (CLEARS THROAT)

23:41.379 --> 23:44.424
We wanted to talk to you
about some of the changes

23:44.549 --> 23:47.219
that happen to your body as you get older.

23:47.344 --> 23:50.664
- Don't do that talk.
- The thing is, the men of the Parker clan...

23:50.764 --> 23:54.101
Um, well, we change relatively slowly.

23:54.267 --> 23:58.522
But, now don't be frightened,
when the change comes, it is...

23:59.523 --> 24:01.008
- Enormous.
- Enormous.

24:01.108 --> 24:02.467
No, no, no.

24:02.567 --> 24:05.303
A lot of girls will be frightened.

24:05.403 --> 24:09.016
In fact, it took me a while
to get used to it, but it's big.

24:09.116 --> 24:11.451
- It's a big change.
- Wow. And it's...

24:11.868 --> 24:13.578
- (MAKES EXPLOSION SOUND)
- Whoomp, there it is.

24:13.703 --> 24:15.856
No, no. I can't talk right now with you.

24:15.956 --> 24:19.292

in the parents department.

Can I ask you a personal question?
How long can you go without blood?

51:01.685 --> 51:06.256
I have no idea. But hey, while we're
being honest with each other,

51:06.356 --> 51:09.568
I should probably tell you, I keep
wondering why it is I don't just drink you.

We'll get food and we'll get blood there.
And then we'll go to my house.

Okay, fine, great. So we do that
and your parents are alive. Then what?

There's still an alien apocalypse
going on.

he'll get smarter.

So we stay alive long enough
for him to figure out
