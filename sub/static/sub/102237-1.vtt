00:01.793 --> 00:02.878
Hey.

00:05.631 --> 00:07.257
You want me to sit here?

00:12.554 --> 00:14.181
Can I smoke?

00:16.140 --> 00:17.434
Hang on.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.781
Where do you want me to start?

01:44.605 --> 01:46.190
I'm 23 years old,

01:46.273 --> 01:50.569
and I still don't understand what it is
that people do.

01:56.742 --> 01:59.161
It's as if all of this were built
on nothing and...

02:00.829 --> 02:02.831
nothing were holding all this together.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.222
I grew up around here.

02:19.640 --> 02:23.060
Apartments are nice.
Some of them have balconies.

02:25.604 --> 02:26.897
And the trees are nice.

02:27.814 --> 02:30.234
I don't understand them either,
but I like 'em.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.531
I think I'd like 'em all.

02:36.949 --> 02:39.743
It'd have to be a pretty fucked-up tree
for me not to like it.

02:45.916 --> 02:48.335
Sometimes I wonder
if life was wasted on me.

02:49.461 --> 02:52.047
It's not that I'm dumb
to the beauty of things.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.049
I take all the beautiful things to heart,

02:54.132 --> 02:57.761
and then they fuck my heart
till I about die from it.

03:01.515 --> 03:04.226
It's just something in me
has always drawn me away...

03:06.395 --> 03:08.438
until there's nothing holding me together.

03:13.068 --> 03:14.611
You know where you're going, right?

03:15.821 --> 03:18.240
Make the first left three times.
You can't go wrong.

03:19.408 --> 03:22.369
I'll meet you in the parking lot.
Two or three minutes, give or take.

03:31.837 --> 03:33.338
I'm in a baseball hat.

03:34.047 --> 03:37.217
Red scarf,
white button-down shirt, blue hoodie.

03:37.301 --> 03:39.970
Some jeans, old sneakers.
Nothing out of the ordinary.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.849
The scarf is to cover
the lower half of my face.

03:43.932 --> 03:45.601
Although it's a little late
for it to do any good.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.311
I've been at this a while now.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.733
And it's no secret
what my face looks like.

03:54.484 --> 03:57.404
All right, no alarms! I'm a wanted man!
They'll kill me!

03:57.487 --> 03:59.239
My God. What is happening?

04:01.491 --> 04:04.119
I got a lot of sadness in the face
to make up for,

04:04.203 --> 04:07.664
so I gotta act like I'm crazy,
or people will think I'm a pussy.

04:08.498 --> 04:09.499
Hey!

04:09.583 --> 04:12.461
Get on the ground!
Get on the fucking ground now!

04:12.544 --> 04:15.297
The one thing about robbing banks
is you're mostly robbing women,

04:15.380 --> 04:17.548
so the last thing you wanna be is rude.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.343
Ma'am, it's nothing personal.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.386
-That's okay.
-What's your name?

04:21.470 --> 04:23.680
-Vanessa.
-Hey, Vanessa. It's nice to meet you.

04:24.723 --> 04:25.766
What's your name?

04:26.433 --> 04:28.852
You're funny, Vanessa.
Now, open your fucking drawer.

04:35.484 --> 04:39.238
As I stood there holding a gun,
taking her in...

04:39.321 --> 04:41.865
something overtook me.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.117
Like a kind of sadness.

04:44.201 --> 04:49.039
It's... as if I'd always known that this
was how things were supposed to end.

04:50.499 --> 04:54.294
But I wasn't made to realize it
until that exact...

04:55.170 --> 04:56.171
moment.

05:31.498 --> 05:34.877
The first time I saw Emily, I was
attending one of the local universities.

05:35.627 --> 05:37.963
The one with the Jesuits.
It was a decent school.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.676
And I don't wanna tell lies,

05:42.759 --> 05:46.388
but I thought, "Man, I'd really
like to fuck this girl."

05:57.691 --> 05:59.776
Called your name, like, ten times.

06:00.569 --> 06:02.905
Sorry. My music was loud.

06:02.988 --> 06:04.990
-Hey.
-I like your sweater.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.950
Thank you. I got it on Coventry.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.036
It's an old, sad bastard sweater.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.789
You're in my English class.

06:14.791 --> 06:17.252
I know. Class sucks though, right?

06:18.670 --> 06:21.381
Yeah. But you always go.

06:21.465 --> 06:22.549
Yes, I do.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.181
I guess I'll see you around.

06:33.560 --> 06:34.728
Hey, where are you from?

06:37.397 --> 06:39.358
Elba, New York.

06:39.441 --> 06:40.526
What's that like?

06:42.152 --> 06:47.074
Same kinda lake. Same kinda town.
Just... little bit shittier.

06:52.996 --> 06:55.040
I've had a girlfriend since high school.

06:55.123 --> 06:57.209
Really? That's sweet.

06:57.292 --> 07:00.045
Yeah, she goes to school in New Jersey.

07:00.546 --> 07:02.089
She got a name?

07:02.172 --> 07:04.508
Yeah. Madison Kowalski.

07:09.221 --> 07:10.639
She's really pretty.

07:11.640 --> 07:14.059
Yeah. Super pretty.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.436
I really liked Emily,

07:16.520 --> 07:19.273
but I'd already promised Madison
I'd catch the Greyhound bus

07:19.356 --> 07:21.233
and go and visit her at school
that weekend.

07:21.900 --> 07:24.903
She was staying in a dorm room,
and her bed was too small for two people,

07:24.987 --> 07:26.196
but...

07:27.197 --> 07:29.116
at least her roommate
had gone home, because...

07:29.199 --> 07:30.617
Her grandmother died.

07:31.326 --> 07:32.536
That's too bad.

07:33.912 --> 07:35.539
Whatever. She was old.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.084
Well...

07:40.335 --> 07:42.004
tell Madison I said hello.

07:53.182 --> 07:55.559
Madison thought I was a bitch.

07:56.560 --> 07:57.561
Let's go.

08:02.524 --> 08:05.235
The parties she took me to
were mostly shit.

08:05.319 --> 08:08.906
The kids drank beer in a basement
done out in cinder block.

08:08.989 --> 08:13.785
Some kind of beer pong, sex dungeon,
red-light district bullshit.

08:13.869 --> 08:15.954
Everything was dismal as murder.

08:21.460 --> 08:24.254
All these random dudes knew Madison.

08:24.338 --> 08:27.799
She'd only been at the school
a month, but they all knew her somehow.

08:32.054 --> 08:36.683
She liked every eye in the room on her,
which is fine. Whatever.

08:36.767 --> 08:40.562
It just got a little awkward when you were
the one who was there at the party

08:40.645 --> 08:45.234
with the girl who is on top of the table,
fucking a ghost.

08:50.072 --> 08:53.742
I had a job, and I'd go to work when
I could have been doing better things,

08:53.825 --> 08:55.536
such as anything. But...

08:55.619 --> 08:56.828
I had to work.

08:57.621 --> 09:00.457
Old Man Fatook had half a dozen daughters
and granddaughters,

09:00.541 --> 09:02.084
and they all worked at his restaurant.

09:02.167 --> 09:05.629
I don't know if he had any grandsons,
but if he did, none of them worked there.

09:06.296 --> 09:09.341
All of the granddaughters drove Escalades
or Denalis or whatever.

09:09.424 --> 09:10.843
Some of the waiters dated 'em.

09:10.926 --> 09:13.053
And she likes to take it up the ass.

09:13.136 --> 09:15.973
Shove her face down in the pillow.
Spit on her.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.141
I think she's really fucking crazy.

09:19.017 --> 09:20.727
I wonder who taught her all that shit.

09:22.145 --> 09:23.564
-Hey.
-Hey.

09:23.647 --> 09:25.691
Come on. Let me see you do it.

09:34.199 --> 09:36.577
Oh, no. Fuck, shit. Shit! Fuck!

09:36.660 --> 09:38.495
Are you a man or what?

09:38.579 --> 09:40.998
Throw it high. High!

09:41.081 --> 09:43.876
So they can hear it in the dining room,
cocksucker.

09:44.543 --> 09:48.213
-Fuck this guy.
-Yeah, I know. Fuck him. Fuck him.

09:48.297 --> 09:49.840
I only lasted two weeks.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.678
After work
I went by James Lightfoot's house.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.805
He was my best friend since grade school.

09:56.889 --> 09:58.849
His dad had died when he was young and...

09:59.850 --> 10:01.602
and so did his mother. And then...

10:02.769 --> 10:05.981
And then his brother came back
all fucked from the war,

10:06.064 --> 10:07.691
so James is mostly alone.

10:11.195 --> 10:12.196
Hey, man.

10:14.448 --> 10:15.449
Except for me.

10:18.035 --> 10:19.453
-You okay?
-Yeah.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.874
I needed a ride to the bank,
so James offered to take me.

10:29.505 --> 10:31.507
The sun was shining on us that day.

10:33.550 --> 10:34.760
And Roy also came.

10:39.097 --> 10:41.308
He painted houses, but he wasn't working.

10:41.391 --> 10:42.559
What's up?

10:42.643 --> 10:45.229
And James Lightfoot was yelling at Roy
about his cousin Joe,

10:45.312 --> 10:48.106
-because Joe kept saying...
-I'm going, so just drop it.

10:48.190 --> 10:51.652
Roy. Roy. Did you tell him?
You gotta tell your cousin

10:51.735 --> 10:53.737
-he can't join the marines.
-Why do I gotta tell him?

10:53.820 --> 10:56.740
-He's joining the marines.
-Don't join the marines, man.

10:56.823 --> 10:59.076
Give me one good reason why, okay?

10:59.159 --> 11:01.119
I don't wanna do this
for the rest of my life.

11:01.203 --> 11:02.538
Why do you wanna join?

11:02.621 --> 11:04.289
I don't wanna do this
for the rest of my life.

11:04.373 --> 11:07.167
Why are you content
just fucking driving around, man?

11:07.251 --> 11:09.086
I don't understand
why you're okay with it.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.547
He wants to do a thing.
Just let him do a thing. Fuck.

11:11.630 --> 11:14.132
It's an obligation of you
and your love for your cousin,

11:14.216 --> 11:15.342
who we all love so much.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.970
Now you're telling me, "I wanna
send him off to his fucking death"?

11:18.053 --> 11:19.137
What are you doing?

11:19.221 --> 11:22.891
-What are you thinking?
-I've signed up, man. It's over.

11:22.975 --> 11:26.019
I could only understand half
of what James was saying.

11:26.812 --> 11:28.939
I couldn't help noticing
that he looked helpless,

11:29.022 --> 11:30.566
waving his arms around,

11:30.649 --> 11:35.237
and that probably no one would ever
listen to him for as long as he lived.

11:38.824 --> 11:40.367
This is not a shitty car.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.578
It is, man. This is the shittiest car.

11:42.661 --> 11:45.455
I just need a cup of water
to cool the engine off.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.165
Get me a cup of water.

11:47.249 --> 11:48.959
I had a problem with the bank.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.628
They'd made a mistake,
and I was there to sort it out.

11:59.303 --> 12:01.972
So you guys sent me this overdraft,
but it's not right.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.473
I paid this off already.

12:04.266 --> 12:05.559
Here.

12:07.519 --> 12:09.354
This is a new overdraft notice.

12:10.022 --> 12:13.317
But that's not possible. I haven't made
a withdrawal since the last deposit.

12:13.859 --> 12:17.487
That deposit brought your balance up
to $10 credit.

12:17.571 --> 12:20.866
But there was an additional
overdraft charge against your account

12:20.949 --> 12:22.534
that put you back in the negative.

12:23.744 --> 12:26.622
But how could you charge me
another overdraft charge

12:26.705 --> 12:28.457
after I'd paid it off already?

12:28.540 --> 12:31.835
-The deposit didn't clear in time.
-No, but I paid it here in cash.

12:31.919 --> 12:35.047
-It didn't clear, sir.
-It was fucking cash. Right here.

12:35.130 --> 12:37.799
It didn't clear.

12:39.009 --> 12:40.010
Next.

12:49.353 --> 12:50.938
Sorry about your car, man.

12:53.815 --> 12:55.025
It was a piece of shit.

12:56.610 --> 12:57.861
Did you get your money back?

12:59.071 --> 13:00.072
No.

13:02.407 --> 13:05.994
As we walked back to James's house,
Roy passed around his Trainwreck.

13:06.995 --> 13:10.791
And after a few hits,
we felt like we were winning again.

13:16.421 --> 13:21.134
The next day was a healthy fall day,
where you could smell the wet leaves.

13:21.218 --> 13:24.263
So I went to Shaker Square
to see some kids that I knew.

13:25.472 --> 13:29.351
They wanted some of my Xanax,
which I was taking because...

13:30.686 --> 13:32.229
I'd had some panic attacks.

13:33.397 --> 13:35.315
-Here you go, boys.
-Eat up.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.735
-What you doing later?
-We're going to a party

13:38.819 --> 13:40.946
-at this girl Maggie's house.
-Cool. Can I come?

13:41.029 --> 13:42.573
Yeah, sure. Do you want some...

13:42.656 --> 13:44.616
And in return,
they offered me some ecstasy.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.994
Fuck yeah, I want some ecstasy.

14:09.183 --> 14:10.475
Is that you?

14:12.811 --> 14:14.104
-Hey.
-Hey.

14:14.188 --> 14:15.814
-What are you--
-You know Maggie?

14:16.440 --> 14:17.900
-What?
-You know Maggie?

14:18.400 --> 14:20.152
Yeah, sort of.

14:20.235 --> 14:21.695
Small world.

14:22.321 --> 14:23.447
Holy shit.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.490
-What?
-Your pupils are huge.

14:28.619 --> 14:31.121
Yeah, I just did some ecstasy.

14:31.205 --> 14:32.289
How is it?

14:32.372 --> 14:34.208
It's actually really good.

14:35.167 --> 14:37.377
I would give you some, but I...

14:38.253 --> 14:39.254
I don't have any more.

14:39.338 --> 14:42.216
That's okay. I turned some down earlier.

14:43.091 --> 14:46.970
This weird guy offered me some.
He said that I should pop it in my butt.

14:47.679 --> 14:49.056
What the fuck?

14:50.516 --> 14:51.600
-Really?
-Yeah.

14:51.683 --> 14:53.894
-Who the fuck is this guy?
-I don't know.

14:53.977 --> 14:55.771
I don't know. He's definitely gone.

14:57.189 --> 14:58.690
It's kinda disrespectful.

14:58.774 --> 15:01.276
Yeah, well,
that's just how some boys talk.

15:03.153 --> 15:05.239
Hey, I'm really happy you're here.

15:05.322 --> 15:06.615
And why is that?

15:08.408 --> 15:10.577
Because I like you. A lot.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.665
-Shut up.
-I really do.

15:15.374 --> 15:16.375
And--

15:19.419 --> 15:21.672
And your jacket's really cool.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.553
And-- What?

15:27.636 --> 15:30.055
-I was just thinking.
-What are you thinking?

15:30.889 --> 15:32.558
Just thinking that you're shady.

15:37.813 --> 15:39.398
Wanna go for a walk?

15:50.659 --> 15:52.327
Your lips taste amazing.

15:55.539 --> 15:57.541
What happened to Madison Kowalski?

16:03.589 --> 16:04.965
That girl's cold-blooded.

16:50.385 --> 16:51.553
I think I adore you.

17:01.230 --> 17:02.523
Do whatever you want, man.

17:16.787 --> 17:20.207
Sometimes I feel like I've already seen
everything that's gonna happen...

17:21.875 --> 17:23.292
and it's a nightmare.

17:29.007 --> 17:30.008
What?

17:31.301 --> 17:32.678
Nothing. I just--

17:35.931 --> 17:37.266
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17:45.274 --> 17:47.776
You don't ever have to be sorry
for the way that you feel.

17:50.237 --> 17:52.322
Why are you being so sweet to me?

17:56.827 --> 17:58.287
I have a thing for weak guys.

18:01.999 --> 18:04.293
That's how you find
the one to break your heart.

18:12.134 --> 18:15.596
Can you look back to when
you met the one you love the most

18:15.679 --> 18:17.764
and remember exactly how it was?

18:17.848 --> 18:21.768
Not as in where you were
or what she was wearing,

18:21.852 --> 18:25.772
but rather in what you saw in her
that made you say,

18:25.856 --> 18:30.235
"Yes, this is what I came here for."

18:31.320 --> 18:33.989
He was on the phone with her,
and I was eavesdropping.

18:34.072 --> 18:35.866
And why were you eavesdropping?

18:36.742 --> 18:39.620
-You're a jerk.
-Sorry. I mean,

18:39.703 --> 18:42.289
that must've been awful for you.

18:43.248 --> 18:46.627
I confronted him about it
the next day, and he tried to buy me off.

18:46.710 --> 18:49.254
Said he'd send me to volleyball camp
if I didn't tell my mom.

18:49.338 --> 18:50.339
Damn.

18:50.839 --> 18:53.842
-I really wanted to go to volleyball camp.
-Yeah? So what'd you do?

18:53.926 --> 18:55.677
I went to volleyball camp.

18:56.220 --> 18:57.429
And then I told my mom.

19:01.767 --> 19:03.310
Your dad sounds like a dick.

19:03.852 --> 19:06.146
Sometimes I feel like love
doesn't actually exist.

19:08.774 --> 19:11.360
It's just pheromones
playing tricks on people.

19:16.156 --> 19:17.366
I love you.

19:27.042 --> 19:28.043
Thank you.

20:23.515 --> 20:25.934
I'm leaving for good
at the end of the semester.

20:27.144 --> 20:29.855
-I really wanna go to school in Canada.
-What?

20:31.064 --> 20:32.149
Since when?

20:33.775 --> 20:35.194
Since now.

20:35.277 --> 20:38.530
There's this
really great school in Montreal.

20:38.614 --> 20:39.781
In Montreal?

20:39.865 --> 20:41.408
Yeah. It's the Paris of Canada.

20:41.491 --> 20:43.660
Yeah, I know what it fucking is.
Please tell me that you're kidding.

20:43.744 --> 20:45.787
-This isn't funny.
-Why would I be kidding you?

20:47.414 --> 20:51.251
So, what? That's it? We're just
supposed to break up. Just like that?

20:51.335 --> 20:55.214
We can't exactly be together when
we live in two different countries, so...

20:55.297 --> 20:56.882
Emily, what the fuck?

20:59.134 --> 21:01.178
Can you please just be mature about this?

21:03.847 --> 21:05.349
Emily, please.

21:07.601 --> 21:10.646
Can we not just talk about this, please?
Emily!

21:14.650 --> 21:15.776
Fuck!

21:38.173 --> 21:42.427
So, what makes a joker like you
wanna join the United States Army for?

21:43.887 --> 21:45.597
This guy had a face like death,

21:45.681 --> 21:47.808
and every other word
out of his mouth was "joker."

21:49.142 --> 21:51.645
-Why aren't you going? Fuck!
-Goddamn joker.

21:53.564 --> 21:55.899
I've just been seeing on the news

21:55.983 --> 21:57.693
that there are kids dying over there.

21:58.360 --> 21:59.403
You know?

22:00.737 --> 22:03.657
Guys from Cleveland who are my age
just trying to do something good,

22:03.740 --> 22:07.911
and here I am, feeling sorry for myself
because my girlfriend broke up with me.

22:09.621 --> 22:10.622
Damn.

22:11.498 --> 22:12.875
She broke your heart.

22:14.668 --> 22:16.670
You're searching
for that gold in the gutter.

22:17.296 --> 22:19.173
A sense of purpose, right?

22:21.133 --> 22:23.427
Yeah. Sense of purpose.

22:24.261 --> 22:27.472
Hot damn! Tell you about purpose.

22:27.556 --> 22:29.099
I like him.

22:29.183 --> 22:30.225
I was too easy.

22:30.851 --> 22:33.270
He knew he had me,
and so by the next day, I was sworn in.

22:33.353 --> 22:34.479
Against all enemies.

22:34.563 --> 22:37.024
-Foreign and domestic.
-Foreign and domestic.

22:37.524 --> 22:39.568
How can you let him go to war?
It's fucking war--

22:39.651 --> 22:41.778
-What do you want me to do?
-Talk him out of it.

22:41.862 --> 22:44.448
I've already talked to him.
I talk to the motherfucker every day.

22:44.531 --> 22:45.657
You talk to him every day.

22:45.741 --> 22:48.035
But you haven't tried to talk him out
of it. He'll listen to you.

22:48.118 --> 22:50.621
James, you fucking slug, dude.
I can fucking hear you.

22:50.704 --> 22:52.748
-I've met your brother, bro. Yes.
-I'm going to fucking Iraq.

22:52.831 --> 22:55.959
-Have you met my brother, dude?
-Not everybody ends up like your brother.

22:56.043 --> 22:58.420
...have a conversation with him
for two seconds? He's fucked in the head.

22:58.504 --> 22:59.755
Can you please fucking move--

22:59.838 --> 23:00.881
Can you move?

23:00.964 --> 23:02.716
No, because I'm trying
to fucking help you!

23:02.799 --> 23:04.593
We've had this conversation!
I'm going next week!

23:04.676 --> 23:06.970
-I don't know what to tell you!
-What the fuck?

23:07.054 --> 23:09.640
-You can't even understand--
-James! James! James! Look!

23:09.723 --> 23:11.016
-What?
-He just doesn't wanna do this

23:11.099 --> 23:12.893
for the rest of his life, all right?

23:13.560 --> 23:15.646
Since when do you give a shit, man?

23:15.729 --> 23:17.481
You haven't said shit,
and now you're on his side?

23:17.564 --> 23:19.274
Can someone please get
the fucking phone, dude?

23:19.358 --> 23:21.068
It's been ringing for, like, 20 minutes.

23:21.151 --> 23:23.445
-Listen--
-...fuck out of the way, bro.

23:23.529 --> 23:26.365
-Hello?
-Hey. It's me.

23:28.700 --> 23:30.452
-You there?
-Yeah, I'm here.

23:30.536 --> 23:32.454
Hey, shut the fuck up, James.

23:32.538 --> 23:33.830
Hey, sorry. How you doing?

23:34.831 --> 23:36.083
I'm leaving soon.

23:37.501 --> 23:38.585
For Montreal.

23:42.589 --> 23:44.174
Can we say goodbye?

23:47.010 --> 23:49.221
I have work today.

23:52.099 --> 23:54.726
-No worries.
-No, no. I wanna say goodbye.

23:54.810 --> 23:57.604
Just come by work.

24:03.402 --> 24:06.572
After Fatook's, Roy had got me
a job at another restaurant.

24:08.407 --> 24:11.660
The owner was throwing a party that day,
and I got to serve drinks.

24:11.743 --> 24:14.538
I told Roy and Joe to come by
so they could drink for free.

24:14.621 --> 24:16.915
And I, of course, asked Emily to stop in.

24:17.666 --> 24:18.876
But she was late.

24:19.501 --> 24:21.170
-You good?
-Yeah, bro, you look good.

24:21.253 --> 24:23.255
-What's up, man? Yo, she here yet?
-Not yet. No.

24:23.338 --> 24:25.507
Relax. Yo, line up the shots. Honestly.

24:27.551 --> 24:30.137
I go to Parris Island on Sunday.

24:30.220 --> 24:32.222
-Parris Island is the marines, right?
-Yeah.

24:32.306 --> 24:33.765
It's a good way to go to heaven.

24:33.849 --> 24:35.350
Have you seen Emily yet?

24:35.434 --> 24:37.394
Hey, breathe, okay?

24:37.477 --> 24:39.605
Relax. I don't know
what you're freaking out about.

24:39.688 --> 24:41.940
What the fuck, man? Who is this guy?

24:42.024 --> 24:44.943
I do not have a problem with it
in general...

24:45.027 --> 24:46.987
-Yeah.
-...but if it makes you better, then--

24:47.779 --> 24:49.489
-Hey.
-Hey.

24:51.658 --> 24:54.953
This is Benji. He's from Ghana.
He's going to Case.

24:56.246 --> 24:57.497
Benji, hey.

24:58.624 --> 25:01.335
I gave Benji a real man handshake,
like I was a real man,

25:01.418 --> 25:03.629
so he was forced to keep his hand off her.

25:03.712 --> 25:06.757
You know, I know a better restaurant
we could go to called Mi Aldea.

25:06.840 --> 25:08.967
The food is so good there.
I think maybe we should go.

25:09.051 --> 25:10.594
-Can I talk to you for a second?
-No, you can't.

25:10.677 --> 25:12.012
-Why not?
-Because you're being a--

25:12.095 --> 25:14.973
-Sorry, are you all right?
-Benji, just give me a minute, dude.

25:15.057 --> 25:16.975
Look, nobody thinks the food
at Mi Aldea's is any good.

25:17.059 --> 25:18.936
He knows they don't card there,
and he's trying to get you drunk.

25:19.019 --> 25:20.687
I came to say goodbye.
What's your fucking problem?

25:20.771 --> 25:22.022
Want me to punch this guy in the dick?

25:22.105 --> 25:23.440
No, Joe.

25:23.524 --> 25:26.360
You came here to say goodbye to me
with him.

25:26.443 --> 25:28.070
I'm not with him.

25:28.153 --> 25:30.572
-Do you really think that's fucking fair?
-Yeah, I do.

25:30.656 --> 25:33.659
-Please let me punch him in the dick.
-Joe, please go and sit the fuck down.

25:38.622 --> 25:40.249
I gotta work. You should go.

25:43.627 --> 25:44.795
I'd like you to leave.

25:49.758 --> 25:50.759
Fine.

26:18.120 --> 26:20.080
How you doing?

26:20.163 --> 26:21.164
Jesus Christ, dude.

26:21.248 --> 26:23.292
-Come on, you gotta cheer up, man.
-Right.

26:23.375 --> 26:26.795
The fuck? You could bang ten girls
in here tonight. Throw a fucking rock.

26:27.379 --> 26:28.755
-Okay?
-Yes, sir.

26:28.839 --> 26:31.091
Listen, I need you to do me a favor.
I'm tired. I'm going home.

26:31.175 --> 26:33.886
I need you to look after a buddy of mine.
His name is Tommy.

26:33.969 --> 26:37.097
That guy over there. Nice guy.
Great guy. Just got out of prison.

26:37.181 --> 26:39.016
Tommy was drunk as fuck.

26:39.099 --> 26:41.810
And I was supposed to make sure
he didn't throw up in the place.

26:42.436 --> 26:44.688
He kept saying everybody was full of shit,
and they were all a...

26:44.771 --> 26:48.525
Bunch of fakes over here.
All these Cosa Nostra motherfuckers.

26:48.609 --> 26:50.152
They like to talk a big game,

26:50.235 --> 26:52.863
but they ain't got the balls
to put a gun to the guy's head.

26:52.946 --> 26:55.949
Put a gun to the guy's head
and blow his brains out.

26:56.033 --> 26:57.242
And that's what he kept saying.

26:57.326 --> 27:00.078
They didn't have the balls to put a gun
to a guy's head...

27:00.162 --> 27:01.955
...and blow his brains out.

27:02.956 --> 27:04.791
And then he got to asking me what I did.

27:05.709 --> 27:08.378
So, what do you do, kid?

27:09.421 --> 27:11.131
I actually just joined the army.

27:11.215 --> 27:13.008
You joined the army?

27:15.677 --> 27:17.638
Those people don't give a shit about you.

27:17.721 --> 27:19.723
What are you thinking?

27:24.061 --> 27:25.479
I just...

27:26.730 --> 27:28.440
I didn't have any better ideas.

27:30.526 --> 27:31.860
But...

27:32.694 --> 27:36.949
do you have the balls to put a gun
to a guy's head and blow his brains out?

27:45.874 --> 27:47.167
You'll be all right.

27:52.214 --> 27:53.632
All right, I gotta go, Tommy.

27:54.508 --> 27:56.885
-Why? Where you going?
-Gotta go to bed. It's late.

27:58.428 --> 28:01.807
What, you need a ride?
I'll give youse a ride.

28:02.432 --> 28:06.353
-You're good to drive?
-Fucking A, bubba.

28:08.146 --> 28:10.399
And Tommy ran over the curb
for good measure.

28:11.775 --> 28:12.776
Thanks.

28:13.569 --> 28:15.988
-Hey, you drive home safe, okay?
-I will.

28:17.614 --> 28:18.949
I never saw him again.

28:40.053 --> 28:41.471
Is it okay that I'm here?

28:42.264 --> 28:43.432
Yeah, I...

28:44.266 --> 28:46.476
I was gonna bring you these later anyway.

28:47.978 --> 28:49.813
Supposed to be a goodbye cake,

28:50.397 --> 28:52.900
but they only had muffins ready.

28:53.734 --> 28:56.445
And there were supposed to be 12,
but I gave one to this guy Tommy,

28:56.528 --> 28:59.698
because he really needed to eat something.

29:01.158 --> 29:02.242
What's wrong?

29:03.035 --> 29:04.036
Hey.

29:04.119 --> 29:06.205
I'd never seen Emily cry before.

29:07.331 --> 29:08.332
Hey.

29:11.919 --> 29:13.962
I'm sorry about earlier, okay?

29:14.046 --> 29:17.049
I told her how I knew she didn't mean
anything by bringing Benji around,

29:17.132 --> 29:18.967
and that she was just a sweetheart

29:19.051 --> 29:22.596
who believed in diversity
and developing countries.

29:22.679 --> 29:24.014
Stop. Stop.

29:28.644 --> 29:31.605
It's all my fault. I'm so sorry.

29:31.688 --> 29:34.691
No, no. You never have
to be sorry, baby, okay?

29:35.943 --> 29:37.861
You don't ever have to be sorry.
It's okay.

29:39.071 --> 29:40.864
It's okay, okay? Hey.

29:42.157 --> 29:43.492
I'm so sorry.

29:43.575 --> 29:44.660
It's okay.

29:47.829 --> 29:50.332
-Hey, you want a muffin?
-Yeah.

29:50.415 --> 29:51.917
Yeah.

29:52.876 --> 29:54.044
Sure?

29:55.420 --> 29:56.964
Muffin?

29:57.756 --> 29:59.675
It was a while before she stopped crying.

30:01.718 --> 30:02.928
And then we laughed.

30:03.470 --> 30:05.180
And then we fucked around...

30:07.516 --> 30:08.767
and it was perfect.

30:14.523 --> 30:16.275
I'm not gonna go to Montreal.

30:41.175 --> 30:42.426
I joined the army.

30:46.638 --> 30:47.639
What?

30:50.058 --> 30:51.393
Why would you do that?

30:53.478 --> 30:55.189
'Cause I was sad, baby.

30:55.272 --> 30:56.690
So you joined the army?

30:56.773 --> 30:57.774
Yep.

31:06.325 --> 31:07.492
Maybe this will be good.

31:07.576 --> 31:09.745
I can go away,
and you can go to school in Montreal.

31:09.828 --> 31:12.706
-I don't wanna go to school in Montreal.
-I thought you loved Montreal.

31:12.789 --> 31:16.335
No. The only reason why I was going
to Montreal was to get away from you.

31:20.964 --> 31:22.049
'Cause I love you.

31:46.114 --> 31:47.115
Look.

31:49.076 --> 31:50.911
I know school is important to you.

31:52.120 --> 31:53.580
And you wanna finish, right?

31:54.122 --> 31:55.207
Yeah.

31:55.290 --> 31:56.667
Okay, so...

31:58.460 --> 31:59.795
while you do this...

32:01.463 --> 32:02.548
I'm gonna do that.

32:05.342 --> 32:06.552
It's just a couple years.

32:08.428 --> 32:10.430
Just a couple years
in a lifetime together.

32:13.767 --> 32:15.686
And I mean that. I really mean that.

32:15.769 --> 32:18.939
Like... you're it for me.

32:20.691 --> 32:21.942
I feel the same way.

32:37.374 --> 32:39.459
Maybe we should get married.

32:44.423 --> 32:46.383
So we went down to the courthouse...

32:47.467 --> 32:48.886
and we got married.

32:52.264 --> 32:53.765
And then we went to celebrate.

32:58.145 --> 33:01.106
It's as if we were the two
most beautiful things in the world...

33:02.399 --> 33:03.942
and no one had it on us.

33:13.327 --> 33:14.786
But the days ran out.

33:17.956 --> 33:19.791
And I had to go to basic training.

33:32.346 --> 33:33.680
First we got the haircut.

33:35.516 --> 33:36.934
Welcome to the army.

33:37.017 --> 33:40.646
For the next ten weeks, the next thing
that comes out of your mouth

33:40.729 --> 33:43.690
is "Yes, Drill Sergeant,"
and "No, Drill Sergeant."

33:43.774 --> 33:45.317
Do I make myself clear?

33:45.400 --> 33:46.568
Yes, Drill Sergeant!

33:46.652 --> 33:49.154
That goes for you
that's getting your hair cut too.

33:49.238 --> 33:53.242
You're not special. You're not special.
Do I make myself clear?

33:53.325 --> 33:55.035
Yes, Drill Sergeant!

33:55.118 --> 33:56.787
It needs to be louder than that.

33:56.870 --> 33:59.748
First name Drill, last name Sergeant.

33:59.831 --> 34:01.416
Do I make myself clear?

34:01.500 --> 34:03.168
Yes, Drill Sergeant!

34:05.379 --> 34:07.631
What are you doing?
You think you're still pretty?

34:07.714 --> 34:09.591
-No, Drill Sergeant!
-You think you're still pretty?

34:09.675 --> 34:10.759
No, Drill Sergeant!

34:10.842 --> 34:12.344
Then get the fuck up
and get out of my chair!

34:12.427 --> 34:14.471
Go away. Go away. Bye-bye.

34:15.347 --> 34:17.516
Next, we got about
a hundred fucking shots.

34:18.891 --> 34:21.395
-Next.
-And I found out that I was actually...

34:21.478 --> 34:22.603
Color blind.

34:23.938 --> 34:25.023
That explains a lot.

34:25.107 --> 34:26.567
Can I still be a medic?

34:26.650 --> 34:28.735
You know what color blood is, right?

34:28.819 --> 34:29.820
Next.

34:29.902 --> 34:32.572
We are your mommy, and we are your daddy.

34:32.656 --> 34:36.659
At no point do you get to do
what you want, when you want.

34:36.743 --> 34:38.328
There was a lot of standing in line,

34:38.411 --> 34:40.873
and our legs ached
because we weren't used to it.

34:40.956 --> 34:42.583
Do I make myself clear?

34:42.666 --> 34:44.251
Yes, Drill Sergeant!

34:44.333 --> 34:45.793
Do I make myself clear?

34:45.878 --> 34:47.212
Yes, Drill Sergeant!

34:47.295 --> 34:50.924
-What the fuck is this?
-What are you doing with your arms?

34:51.007 --> 34:55.429
Put your fucking arms down!
You are a part of the United States--

34:57.806 --> 35:00.475
Your laces
are gonna be inside of your shoes,

35:00.559 --> 35:03.270
and your shoes are gonna be touching.
Execute.

35:04.354 --> 35:05.814
Come on. Get 'em off. Now!

35:05.898 --> 35:08.817
-Five, four...
-What the fuck is the matter with you?

35:08.901 --> 35:10.611
-...three, two...
-Faster, faster, faster!

35:10.694 --> 35:12.487
-You've done this a hundred times!
-...one.

35:13.363 --> 35:14.364
Execute.

35:14.448 --> 35:15.908
Move, goddamn it! Move!

35:15.991 --> 35:18.911
-Ten, nine...
-Get your fucking attitude right.

35:18.994 --> 35:22.206
...eight, seven...

35:23.248 --> 35:26.793
They had us strip down to our underwear
and duckwalk the circuit of a big room.

35:28.629 --> 35:31.882
The room smelled of balls, unwashed.
And feet, ditto.

35:35.302 --> 35:36.386
All good.

35:36.470 --> 35:37.554
Next.

35:37.638 --> 35:40.557
And there was a man whose job it was
to check everybody's asshole.

35:42.351 --> 35:43.393
Drop your pants.

35:43.477 --> 35:45.687
I really like this jacket, man.

35:46.355 --> 35:48.482
I'm gonna take my girl
out to dinner in this when I get home.

35:48.565 --> 35:49.566
Oh, yeah?

35:49.650 --> 35:51.318
Imagine all the patches
and medals on it and shit.

35:51.401 --> 35:52.986
You think you're gonna get a medal, huh?

35:53.654 --> 35:54.863
That's Jimenez.

35:54.947 --> 35:56.740
I know I am.

35:56.823 --> 36:00.994
We had become friends on account of
the fact that we both wanted to be medics.

36:01.745 --> 36:03.914
He'd joined the army
'cause he'd gotten his girl pregnant.

36:03.997 --> 36:07.626
Hey, I love you. So much, okay?

36:09.461 --> 36:11.004
And I want this.

36:12.464 --> 36:15.300
I'm gonna get a job.
And I'm gonna take care of both of you.

36:15.384 --> 36:16.385
How?

36:18.011 --> 36:19.513
We'll figure it out, okay?

36:20.722 --> 36:24.059
Look at you, you fucking weak dick flap.

36:24.142 --> 36:25.769
You ain't shit!

36:27.354 --> 36:29.106
-There was a lot of yelling.
-Six...

36:29.189 --> 36:31.358
Move! Move, dick flap. Let's go!

36:31.441 --> 36:33.235
Do you wanna die, you beef curtain?

36:33.318 --> 36:35.320
There are hajis breathing down
your piss hole.

36:36.029 --> 36:37.573
They called us names like...

36:37.656 --> 36:40.951
Dick with ears!
Get up, you dick with ears!

36:41.034 --> 36:43.912
-Our hands were...
-Use your goddamn dick skinners!

36:43.996 --> 36:45.998
-Our mouths were...
-Cock holster!

36:46.081 --> 36:48.458
You shut that ugly cock holster.

36:48.542 --> 36:51.086
Drill sergeants pretended
to be real angry all the time.

36:51.170 --> 36:52.171
The fuck?

36:54.214 --> 36:56.049
Next time, back the fuck off,

36:56.133 --> 36:59.136
or I might wig out
and snap your fucking neck.

36:59.219 --> 37:00.345
PTSD, they say.

37:00.429 --> 37:02.097
What are you looking at? Eyes forward!

37:02.181 --> 37:07.269
Like this one time, Drill Sergeant Cole
punched me in the penis for no reason.

37:07.352 --> 37:08.770
Attention!

37:10.772 --> 37:13.442
Drill Sergeant Deco, he even choked a kid.

37:14.568 --> 37:15.903
Drill Sergeant Deco.

37:18.864 --> 37:20.199
Fucking haji.

37:21.074 --> 37:22.409
Drill Sergeant, that's Levine.

37:24.786 --> 37:26.496
It wasn't because of PTSD though.

37:28.123 --> 37:31.793
Deco hadn't ever been anywhere.
He was full of shit.

37:35.088 --> 37:37.341
Some of the drill sergeants
had actually seen Iraq,

37:37.424 --> 37:39.843
but they were full of shit too.

37:39.927 --> 37:43.680
In Iraq, there are grenade children

37:43.764 --> 37:47.017
who try to sneak up on American soldiers

37:47.100 --> 37:50.229
so as to blow them the fuck up!

37:51.522 --> 37:55.692
I had to run over the hand grenade
children with my truck!

37:56.443 --> 37:59.112
That's why I'm sick in the head!

37:59.196 --> 38:02.282
Now, let's go! You need to be
at your three o'clock-- You need to be--

38:02.366 --> 38:05.577
Holy crap, wake up, son!
Wake up, son! Wake up!

38:08.247 --> 38:09.581
-Bang, bang!
-Nine o'clock.

38:09.665 --> 38:10.791
Bang, bang!

38:10.874 --> 38:12.709
-Haji left!
-Bang, bang!

38:12.793 --> 38:15.587
Haji on the right.
Haji in the trees! Look up!

38:16.213 --> 38:18.006
Sneaking up on you, haji left.

38:18.757 --> 38:20.759
-Haji to the right!
-Haji on your left!

38:20.843 --> 38:22.094
Haji to the left!

38:22.177 --> 38:24.638
-Haji on your left!
-Haji to the right!

38:24.721 --> 38:27.891
I started to get this weird feeling
like it was all just make-believe.

38:27.975 --> 38:29.184
Bang, bang.

38:29.268 --> 38:31.144
That we were just pretending
to be soldiers.

38:31.937 --> 38:34.398
The drill sergeants were just
pretending to be drill sergeants.

38:34.481 --> 38:37.234
Jabberwocky, jabberwocky,
jabberwocky, jabberwocky...

38:39.570 --> 38:42.281
Mishmash, mishmash, mishmash...

38:43.907 --> 38:46.285
And the army
was pretending to be the army.

38:46.368 --> 38:49.621
For where'er we go
You will always know

38:49.705 --> 38:53.292
That the army goes rolling along

38:53.375 --> 38:55.961
The only way
not to graduate basic training

38:56.044 --> 38:57.629
was to try and kill yourself.

39:00.382 --> 39:02.843
One kid tried to hang himself
from a water pipe in the latrine.

39:02.926 --> 39:06.054
Fuck! Shit! Jesus Christ.
Fucking hell, bud.

39:06.138 --> 39:08.473
Help! Drill Sergeant!

39:08.557 --> 39:11.560
He didn't die,
but he didn't graduate either.

39:11.643 --> 39:12.811
Hey, can you hear me?

39:12.895 --> 39:14.104
Yeah. Hi.

39:15.814 --> 39:16.899
Are you all right?

39:20.068 --> 39:22.779
I just snuck out of the barracks.

39:23.322 --> 39:24.656
Yeah, but are you okay?

39:30.329 --> 39:31.455
I'm good now.

39:35.125 --> 39:37.044
Heads down. Asses down.

39:37.127 --> 39:38.795
When they finally taught us
how to be medics,

39:38.879 --> 39:40.672
there was a lot of fucking around
with mannequins.

39:40.756 --> 39:42.424
Don't let him bleed out. Get pressure on.

39:42.508 --> 39:45.135
-His life is in your hands. Let's go!
-Sucking chest wound!

39:45.219 --> 39:47.513
-Ticktock. Ticktock.
-Give that wound a bandage.

39:47.596 --> 39:49.473
Apply to body
from inside the bandage wrapper.

39:49.556 --> 39:50.557
Pressure on there.

39:50.641 --> 39:53.519
Seal all three sides tight.
Airtight-tight.

39:53.602 --> 39:56.355
-Come on. Get it done now.
-Check his back for an exit wound.

39:56.438 --> 39:58.607
There were mannequins
that were just trunks with heads.

39:58.690 --> 40:01.318
There were mannequins with
rubber bones sticking out of their legs.

40:01.401 --> 40:03.779
There were mannequins
that could squirt fake blood.

40:03.862 --> 40:06.406
There were even little baby mannequins
with cherubim faces.

40:06.490 --> 40:08.033
Traumatic amputation.

40:10.077 --> 40:13.080
You're a go!
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation!

40:13.163 --> 40:15.499
One and two and three and four and five.

40:15.582 --> 40:17.793
-Breathe.
-You're a go.

40:17.876 --> 40:21.255
Jimenez and I
saved the lives of 47 dummies.

40:21.797 --> 40:23.632
And so we passed the class.

40:23.715 --> 40:24.967
Warrior Medics.

40:26.593 --> 40:29.304
You were told to come up
with a company cheer.

40:30.973 --> 40:33.517
You had a week to do this.

40:34.309 --> 40:37.187
This is what is called a deadline!

40:38.856 --> 40:42.568
As of now, you have missed the deadline.

40:46.947 --> 40:48.282
Now,

40:48.949 --> 40:52.494
since you have failed to come up
with a company cheer,

40:52.578 --> 40:55.747
I have taken
what is called the initiative...

40:56.832 --> 41:00.002
and come up with one you'll have to learn.

41:01.378 --> 41:03.172
And this is what he came up with.

41:03.672 --> 41:05.716
Warrior Medics in the fight

41:05.799 --> 41:07.759
Warrior Medics in the fight

41:07.843 --> 41:09.761
On the double day and night

41:09.845 --> 41:11.638
On the double day and night

41:11.722 --> 41:13.891
We will beat out all the rest

41:13.974 --> 41:15.893
We will beat out all the rest

41:15.976 --> 41:17.811
Charlie Company is the best

41:17.895 --> 41:19.855
Charlie Company is the best

41:19.938 --> 41:21.899
Don't stop, get it, get it

41:21.982 --> 41:23.609
Don't stop, get it, get it

41:23.692 --> 41:25.444
Soldier on, Warrior Medics

41:25.527 --> 41:27.321
Soldier on, Warrior Medics

41:33.285 --> 41:34.786
Make way!

41:34.870 --> 41:36.496
Here come the Warrior Medics!

41:36.580 --> 41:38.040
Ooh! Tay!

41:38.123 --> 41:39.458
Here come the Warrior Medics!

41:39.541 --> 41:41.210
Make way!

41:41.293 --> 41:44.087
And from that day on, whenever
the company was called to attention,

41:44.171 --> 41:47.341
something that happened no less
than a million times on any given day,

41:47.424 --> 41:50.052
the company cheer
was to be recited in its entirety.

41:50.135 --> 41:52.262
-Here come the Warrior Medics!
-No exceptions.

41:52.346 --> 41:55.224
You guys are soft like some nice titties.

41:55.724 --> 41:57.476
Make way!

41:57.559 --> 41:59.978
And to make matters worse, after a while,

42:00.062 --> 42:03.857
it got to be expected that
the guidon bearer, which was me,

42:03.941 --> 42:06.360
would do the robot throughout the refrain.

42:06.443 --> 42:07.736
Here come the Warrior Medics!

42:07.819 --> 42:09.112
Make way!

42:09.196 --> 42:10.614
Here come the Warrior Medics!

42:11.240 --> 42:13.408
So don't ever join the fucking army.

43:01.540 --> 43:03.500
You were wide awake
when you got on the ground

43:03.584 --> 43:05.252
outside the wire for the first time.

43:05.335 --> 43:07.754
You expected to get shot at any moment.

43:08.589 --> 43:11.800
Even if you were in a spot
where you couldn't see anyone for miles,

43:11.884 --> 43:14.469
you were nevertheless sure
that there was a haji out there

43:14.553 --> 43:17.723
who had been waiting all day
just to shoot you.

43:25.022 --> 43:28.233
Attention on the net.
Attention on the net. Troops in contact.

43:28.317 --> 43:32.571
Current location, Victor-Sierra 453, 132.

43:32.654 --> 43:34.281
Stand by for SALUTE report.

43:34.781 --> 43:37.826
Break, break. Raven Base.
This is Quebec-Romeo-Foxtrot.

43:37.910 --> 43:41.413
We are seven minutes out,
en route to TIC. Over.

43:43.373 --> 43:45.292
Number one, bump it up.

43:45.876 --> 43:49.213
-We have troops in contact.
-All right. Let's get us in there.

43:49.296 --> 43:51.465
Contact. At least 17 to 20 people.

43:51.548 --> 43:53.383
Activity, coordinated attack.

43:53.467 --> 43:55.177
Request immediate support.

43:55.260 --> 43:57.387
We're under heavy fire, vicinity of--

44:12.027 --> 44:14.696
Contact right! Get out! Get out! Get out!

44:14.780 --> 44:18.825
Raven Base, Raven Base!
Goddamn it. Raven Base!

44:18.909 --> 44:20.160
Hey, Sarge!

44:20.244 --> 44:22.663
-What have we got?
-We got two wounded over there!

44:22.746 --> 44:25.374
Take those two back here.
I'll get the QRF.

44:25.457 --> 44:26.834
-Okay. Copy.
-Move it!

44:41.974 --> 44:43.350
Arnold, take six.

44:45.018 --> 44:46.854
And grab your shit. Let's go, go, go!

44:47.729 --> 44:49.189
Fuck! Fuck!

44:52.359 --> 44:54.862
Hey! Hey, look at me! Breathe.

44:56.989 --> 44:58.073
Stay on me.

44:58.156 --> 44:59.366
Let's go.

45:02.828 --> 45:03.829
Down!

45:05.205 --> 45:07.708
Cover right. Cover right. Go!

45:14.548 --> 45:15.549
Move!

45:16.341 --> 45:18.260
Medic up! Medic up!

45:21.388 --> 45:22.431
Get down!

45:27.978 --> 45:29.479
Hey! Get some pressure on it.

45:29.563 --> 45:32.482
Get the fuck off me.
Up the hill. Up the hill!

45:38.197 --> 45:39.323
Stay here!

45:40.949 --> 45:42.951
Coming in! What do you need?

45:43.619 --> 45:46.413
I got at least two wounded up front!
Get them the fuck out!

45:46.496 --> 45:48.916
-All right. Move, move, move!
-Let's go, let's go!

45:48.999 --> 45:50.209
Okay.

45:56.298 --> 45:57.424
Medic!

45:58.425 --> 46:01.220
-Over here. Get his guts in!
-Jesus fuck!

46:01.303 --> 46:04.139
-Bring it in.
-I said get his guts in now!

46:08.810 --> 46:09.978
More!

46:22.574 --> 46:24.034
-Everybody.
-Lift him.

46:24.117 --> 46:25.160
-Go!
-Ready?

46:25.244 --> 46:28.247
-Three, two, one!
-Here it is. Here it is.

46:28.330 --> 46:31.291
Bird inbound! Bird inbound!
Get the litter up!

46:31.375 --> 46:33.377
-Lift up!
-Let's go!

46:43.136 --> 46:45.681
In the dust, I could see the man's face.

46:45.764 --> 46:51.019
His eyes were wild and grieving,
and he was in his lizard brain.

46:51.103 --> 46:54.106
Hey! Hey! Look at me! Hey!

46:55.065 --> 46:56.525
We locked eyes, and I said...

46:56.608 --> 46:57.943
I've got you!

46:58.026 --> 47:00.821
I said it real loud,
so he could hear me over the helicopters.

47:00.904 --> 47:04.032
And then I felt embarrassed, because
it was a stupid thing to have said.

47:04.116 --> 47:05.701
All right, let's move on out!

47:06.827 --> 47:08.871
Ready! Ready! Up!

47:08.954 --> 47:10.622
-Up!
-Let's move!

47:25.721 --> 47:27.306
Back! Move back!

48:24.947 --> 48:26.782
Oh, yeah.

48:53.141 --> 48:54.142
Fuck.

48:54.893 --> 48:57.187
This fucking blood won't come out
of my wedding ring.

49:17.082 --> 49:21.044
In the early days, the infantry felt like
they were ten feet tall and invincible.

49:21.128 --> 49:22.963
They were impatient to begin killing.

49:24.381 --> 49:26.341
They wanted to kill so bad

49:26.425 --> 49:29.469
there was this profligate confidence
in our firepower.

49:29.553 --> 49:31.972
And there was this bullshit camaraderie.

49:35.309 --> 49:37.477
At ease!

49:39.855 --> 49:42.065
What in the fuck?

49:43.609 --> 49:47.362
Running. He was just running.
Fast, fast, fast. And then--

49:56.288 --> 49:57.623
Dude, what the fuck happened?

50:01.919 --> 50:04.588
This guy, his guts were hanging out.

50:04.671 --> 50:06.173
We had to put 'em back in.

50:07.007 --> 50:08.300
Getting shot at.

50:08.759 --> 50:11.011
-We had to run up to the chopper.
-Hey.

50:12.054 --> 50:15.307
I heard on the radio those guys
you put in the helicopter are dead.

50:15.807 --> 50:17.017
Shit.

50:18.143 --> 50:21.563
Hey, Sarge. Is it true those guys
we put on the bird today are dead?

50:21.647 --> 50:22.648
Who told you that?

50:23.232 --> 50:25.901
-Arnold said he heard it on the net.
-Arnold's a fucking retard.

50:28.320 --> 50:31.114
-I thought that's what I heard, Sarge.
-Shut up, Arnold.

50:31.907 --> 50:34.159
That's Staff Sergeant Greene.

50:34.243 --> 50:36.912
They said he'd already killed 15 hajis.

50:37.913 --> 50:39.873
He was a hard motherfucker.

50:41.124 --> 50:42.251
So, they're not dead?

50:43.252 --> 50:45.379
Quit worrying about it so much, huh?

50:46.421 --> 50:48.006
You got your cherry popped today.

50:57.891 --> 50:59.893
We took eight fucking casualties today.

51:00.644 --> 51:01.770
Out of 800.

51:02.521 --> 51:04.648
And we're here for a fucking year.

51:05.524 --> 51:08.402
A year's worth of fucking days.
Do the math.

51:09.361 --> 51:10.612
We're fucked.

51:12.447 --> 51:14.658
What did you guys think
you were coming here to do?

51:15.868 --> 51:18.537
Damn, Lessing. You're a downer.

51:18.620 --> 51:20.080
Truth hurts, baby.

51:21.623 --> 51:22.875
And he was right.

51:24.293 --> 51:25.961
Everything there was about dying.

51:28.547 --> 51:31.633
They even called the area we were
stationed in "the Triangle of Death."

51:36.680 --> 51:40.642
And, like idiots,
we patrolled every inch of it.

51:46.190 --> 51:49.151
Most days, it felt like
we were just glorified scarecrows.

51:49.860 --> 51:54.031
There to look busy,
expensive as fuck and dumber than shit.

52:01.246 --> 52:04.333
Look at that one in the dress. She looks
like Pebbles from The Flintstones.

52:04.416 --> 52:06.376
Oh, yeah. She is kinda cute.

52:06.460 --> 52:10.339
That's Sergeant North. He was from Idaho.

52:10.422 --> 52:12.466
-And he was also a killer.
-Stop.

52:12.549 --> 52:15.719
You know you want it, bitch.
Fuck! Stop fucking moving.

52:20.599 --> 52:23.143
-Mister. Mister.
-You want this? This?

52:23.227 --> 52:24.603
You want this?

52:25.187 --> 52:28.732
Move. Get out the way.
Pebbles, come here. Come here, Pebbles.

52:28.815 --> 52:30.817
You want this? You want this? Yeah?

52:37.783 --> 52:38.784
Let's go.

52:49.002 --> 52:52.798
On Christmas Day,
the Denver Mustang cheerleaders arrived.

53:06.019 --> 53:08.355
They waved and bounced
with their white teeth.

53:08.438 --> 53:10.566
The whole thing seemed goddamn awful.

53:10.649 --> 53:13.485
Beautiful women with skin
like expensive cream.

53:17.990 --> 53:21.201
It wasn't like they were gonna fuck you.
And that's what it was all about.

53:21.285 --> 53:23.871
You were supposed to want to fuck them,

53:24.454 --> 53:27.374
and they were supposed to not fuck you.

53:28.667 --> 53:29.960
You know you want it, bitch!

53:30.043 --> 53:33.088
All right.
Everybody looking at me, say "Hajis."

53:33.172 --> 53:35.382
Hajis!

53:35.465 --> 53:38.594
But I was okay with that.
I didn't even watch porn.

53:38.677 --> 53:41.180
USA! USA! USA!

53:41.763 --> 53:43.515
I'd jerk off in the porta-shitters.

53:45.475 --> 53:47.603
Didn't even think of other girls.

53:49.146 --> 53:50.189
Fuck me.

53:53.859 --> 53:55.319
Fuck me.

53:58.947 --> 54:01.074
I'm not ashamed of this.
I just tried to be good.

54:03.660 --> 54:05.829
Miss you so goddamn much, baby.

54:06.580 --> 54:07.748
I miss you too.

54:09.333 --> 54:10.959
Hey, I've got some really good news.

54:11.043 --> 54:12.085
Oh, yeah? What's that?

54:12.836 --> 54:15.047
Your parents offered to help us buy
a starter home.

54:18.967 --> 54:21.136
-You there?
-Yeah, I'm here. I just--

54:21.845 --> 54:23.430
-I'm happy, that's all.
-Time.

54:24.056 --> 54:26.225
-Jesus, man. I'm on the phone.
-Hurry the fuck up.

54:26.308 --> 54:27.768
I'm on the fucking phone, dude.

54:30.604 --> 54:32.439
I think about you everywhere I go, baby.

54:32.523 --> 54:34.316
-Fuck you, new dick.
-Fuck you, motherfucker.

54:34.399 --> 54:37.194
-I'm on the goddamn phone.
-Then hurry the fuck up!

54:37.277 --> 54:39.530
-What is it?
-It's nothing, baby. I just--

54:39.613 --> 54:42.616
-I can't wait to be home with you.
-Time, Private.

54:42.699 --> 54:43.951
Fuck.

54:45.369 --> 54:46.828
Time, Private!

54:49.831 --> 54:50.958
I gotta go, baby.

54:51.625 --> 54:53.502
-I love you.
-I love you too.

54:55.754 --> 54:56.797
It's all yours, Sarge.

54:58.924 --> 55:01.552
Calm the fuck down, towelhead.
Get the fuck back!

55:01.635 --> 55:03.262
Could you ask him what happened?

55:06.431 --> 55:09.977
He says it happened when he was zip-tied,
few days ago.

55:10.060 --> 55:11.395
Jesus.

55:11.478 --> 55:13.480
Dude, look at this guy's hand.

55:14.481 --> 55:15.482
Fuck.

55:16.692 --> 55:17.901
Hey, excuse me, Sarge?

55:19.111 --> 55:20.195
Yeah?

55:20.279 --> 55:22.447
Would you take a look at this guy's hand?

55:24.867 --> 55:26.118
It's cellulitis.

55:27.953 --> 55:29.913
We're out of antibiotics.

55:29.997 --> 55:30.998
So?

55:32.541 --> 55:34.334
What can I do for this guy?

55:35.961 --> 55:37.921
Tell him to eat shit and die.

55:38.005 --> 55:40.340
You gotta tell him to go to a hospital,

55:40.424 --> 55:43.802
see a doctor and get some antibiotics,
'cause we don't have any medicine here.

55:45.095 --> 55:46.138
You're welcome.

55:46.221 --> 55:48.140
-Thanks.
-Make sure he gets to a hospital, okay?

55:48.223 --> 55:50.601
-They won't take us.
-You just gotta try, buddy.

55:50.684 --> 55:51.935
Try your best.

55:54.980 --> 55:56.023
Yes, sir!

55:59.109 --> 56:00.194
All right, who's next?

56:04.740 --> 56:07.409
-Please. Please.
-Not these little fuckers again.

56:09.244 --> 56:10.621
Hey, Pebbles, come here.

56:11.622 --> 56:12.873
Nah, she's all right, man.

56:12.956 --> 56:14.208
Come here.

56:14.291 --> 56:15.876
What the fuck are you doing?

56:15.959 --> 56:18.253
This is for you, okay?

56:18.337 --> 56:21.048
I want you to have this.
That's for you. All right.

56:25.511 --> 56:26.553
Hey!

56:27.679 --> 56:29.723
Shit, man! She got hit!

56:32.017 --> 56:33.185
Look at that.

56:34.311 --> 56:35.854
Made her fucking day.

56:37.814 --> 56:39.233
Fuck.

56:40.234 --> 56:41.902
You know what I would love right now?

56:42.611 --> 56:43.862
Taco?

56:44.988 --> 56:47.241
Fuck you, bitch. Fuck you.

56:47.866 --> 56:50.202
Yes, a motherfucking taco.
Yes, I would love a taco.

56:50.285 --> 56:51.620
What do you want in your taco?

56:51.703 --> 56:56.250
Some carne asada, some fucking guacamole,
some onions.

56:56.333 --> 56:58.335
What? Yeah. Fuck you.

56:59.378 --> 57:00.671
My girl's the only one.

57:02.005 --> 57:03.507
-For real?
-Yeah. Yeah, bro.

57:04.675 --> 57:06.510
-The only one?
-The only one.

57:06.593 --> 57:08.971
-But Bautista too, right?
-Fuck you, bitch.

57:10.472 --> 57:12.224
What you reckon they're doing right now?

57:13.934 --> 57:16.603
Probably with her new dude.

57:18.897 --> 57:20.315
I'll have to kill him.

57:21.233 --> 57:22.609
Some big-ass dude.

57:23.527 --> 57:25.445
He'd been away a year,

57:25.529 --> 57:27.573
and his wife has a one-month-old baby

57:28.323 --> 57:29.992
that she fucking says is his.

57:33.453 --> 57:35.080
I fucking hate it here, dude.

57:36.790 --> 57:38.041
I just wanna go home.

57:42.337 --> 57:44.798
Raven Base, Raven Base.

57:45.465 --> 57:47.843
This is Echo-5-November, over.

57:47.926 --> 57:49.595
Echo-5-November, this is Raven Base.

57:49.678 --> 57:51.555
Yeah, we're gonna get off this line.

57:51.638 --> 57:53.015
Base copy, over.

57:53.682 --> 57:54.683
Lead, this is two.

57:54.766 --> 57:56.185
Go for lead.

57:56.268 --> 57:58.270
We're gonna get off this line
to the right.

57:58.353 --> 57:59.396
Copy that.

58:00.689 --> 58:02.441
Hey, excuse me, Sergeant North?

58:02.524 --> 58:03.775
What is it, fuckstick?

58:03.859 --> 58:06.445
I don't think we should try and drive
through here, Sergeant.

58:06.528 --> 58:08.155
I think we ought to stay on the road.

58:08.238 --> 58:11.325
Is that what you think,
you fucking PFC-wanna-be-a-private?

58:12.951 --> 58:15.537
That road runs right through
an "oh, shit" zone.

58:15.621 --> 58:17.331
You want me to put all these men in danger

58:17.414 --> 58:19.708
'cause you don't wanna save
two fucking minutes?

58:19.791 --> 58:22.419
When I went out with First Platoon,
we got four vehicles stuck

58:22.503 --> 58:24.505
trying to drive through this shit,
Sergeant.

58:25.297 --> 58:26.423
Looks fine to me.

58:27.049 --> 58:28.884
It ain't fine.
It's the shit that's underneath--

58:28.967 --> 58:30.552
Enough!

58:31.136 --> 58:32.721
Hold your fucking man pleaser.

58:35.182 --> 58:36.475
Floor it, Cheetah.

58:41.772 --> 58:43.482
Stop the vehicle, Private.

58:44.566 --> 58:46.151
Stop the vehicle.

58:47.277 --> 58:50.113
Stop the fucking vehicle! Fuck!

58:51.907 --> 58:54.326
Hey, yo. What did I fucking say, man?

58:54.409 --> 58:55.410
Cheetah!

58:56.495 --> 59:00.707
Get your vitamin-depleted ass up here
and get this POS out of the fucking mud!

59:01.333 --> 59:03.377
Hey, I wouldn't do that
if I were you, Sergeant.

59:03.961 --> 59:05.170
That's exactly what we did.

59:05.254 --> 59:07.214
You'll only make things harder
for QRF when they get here.

59:07.297 --> 59:08.674
Shut the fuck up and watch your sector.

59:08.757 --> 59:10.592
You need a Bradley and a tow cable, Sarge.

59:10.676 --> 59:13.512
Shut the fuck up.

59:14.847 --> 59:16.056
Roger that, Sergeant.

59:27.067 --> 59:28.819
Fuck this shit.

59:28.902 --> 59:31.655
-Motherfucker.
-It's hot as fuck out here, man.

59:31.738 --> 59:33.031
-I'm so thirsty--
-B!

59:34.908 --> 59:36.618
Go get me a fucking Bradley.

59:39.454 --> 59:40.956
We're gonna be stuck here for--

59:41.039 --> 59:43.876
North says QRF can't get here
for a few hours.

59:43.959 --> 59:46.420
He wants me,
Yuri, Lessing and Jimenez to go back

59:46.503 --> 59:49.089
-and get a Bradley with a tow cable.
-Yeah, no shit.

59:49.173 --> 59:51.466
You're on radio watch, smart-ass.

59:51.550 --> 59:53.468
-No, tell him to go fuck himself.
-Really?

59:53.552 --> 59:55.429
Yeah, for real.
Tell him to go fuck himself.

59:55.512 --> 59:57.806
-Bautista!
-Coming now, Sarge!

59:57.890 --> 1:00:00.100
Come on, boys! Let's go! Move out!

1:00:00.184 --> 1:00:02.352
-What are you, North's bottom?
-No.

1:00:02.436 --> 1:00:05.189
I don't want to spend
the next four hours waiting to be shot.

1:00:05.272 --> 1:00:07.149
Guess Cheetah just loves America.

1:00:07.232 --> 1:00:08.400
I do.

1:00:08.483 --> 1:00:11.862
So let's get out of this fucking shithole
sandbox, and let's go home. Come on!

1:00:12.696 --> 1:00:14.656
Hey, don't let North
fuck with you too hard, all right?

1:00:14.740 --> 1:00:16.825
I think he means don't let North
fuck you too hard.

1:00:16.909 --> 1:00:18.368
Oh, yeah, he's got a big dick?

1:00:18.452 --> 1:00:19.661
Fucking asshole.

1:00:41.225 --> 1:00:42.684
Fuck!

1:00:44.019 --> 1:00:45.354
Get down! Get down!

1:00:45.437 --> 1:00:46.605
Oh, shit!

1:00:47.773 --> 1:00:49.274
Don't fucking run into it!

1:00:50.192 --> 1:00:52.027
Oh, shit. No, no, no.

1:00:53.278 --> 1:00:55.197
No, no. No, no, no.

1:00:58.992 --> 1:01:01.203
The smell is something
that you already know.

1:01:03.121 --> 1:01:04.748
It's coded in your blood.

1:01:05.832 --> 1:01:09.253
The smoke gets in your pores
and every gland.

1:01:09.336 --> 1:01:11.421
Your mouth is full of it...

1:01:12.923 --> 1:01:15.467
to the point where you
might as well be eating the shit.

1:01:28.897 --> 1:01:30.148
No other contact?

1:01:30.983 --> 1:01:32.860
No contact. We didn't see anything.

1:01:37.114 --> 1:01:38.365
I'll go get me a Bradley.

1:01:40.325 --> 1:01:41.869
I'll go get the bodies.

1:01:44.955 --> 1:01:46.832
Hey, bring the bags.

1:01:57.134 --> 1:01:58.302
Private.

1:02:10.105 --> 1:02:11.356
That was Lessing.

1:02:13.901 --> 1:02:16.236
Our driver was Yuri.

1:02:22.075 --> 1:02:24.077
Our gunner was Bautista.

1:02:28.790 --> 1:02:30.375
And that--

1:02:35.589 --> 1:02:39.593
And that's... Private Jimenez in the back.

1:02:44.056 --> 1:02:45.182
Let's get 'em out.

1:02:45.265 --> 1:02:49.186
All right. Fuck. Captain-- Fuck.
My gloves are melting, Captain.

1:02:49.269 --> 1:02:52.898
It's all right.
Just try hooking your arms instead.

1:02:53.440 --> 1:02:54.441
Yes, sir.

1:02:57.069 --> 1:02:58.237
I got it.

1:02:58.320 --> 1:02:59.780
-You good?
-Yeah.

1:03:03.700 --> 1:03:04.993
All right.

1:03:05.077 --> 1:03:06.453
Release.

1:03:33.105 --> 1:03:35.232
Mister, mister, mister! MRE!

1:03:35.315 --> 1:03:37.943
Mister, mister! Mister, MRE!

1:03:38.026 --> 1:03:40.529
MRE, mister! Mister. MRE.

1:03:40.612 --> 1:03:42.197
Mister. Mister. MRE!

1:03:42.781 --> 1:03:45.993
Mister. MRE. Mister, mister!

1:03:46.076 --> 1:03:48.871
Suddenly there was nothing
interesting about it anymore.

1:04:00.549 --> 1:04:01.758
There was nothing.

1:04:11.393 --> 1:04:13.103
Are you seeing bad things?

1:04:16.231 --> 1:04:17.357
Yeah, a little.

1:04:18.275 --> 1:04:19.860
Are people getting killed?

1:04:21.278 --> 1:04:25.657
Because I'm seeing on the news
that people are getting killed.

1:04:28.702 --> 1:04:30.746
-Hello?
-Yeah, baby, I'm here.

1:04:32.331 --> 1:04:34.166
You're gonna make it through this, okay?

1:04:36.502 --> 1:04:38.962
I know that you're gonna
make it through this.

1:04:41.423 --> 1:04:43.383
Could you just talk about you
for a second?

1:04:44.176 --> 1:04:45.761
What's going on with you?

1:04:48.972 --> 1:04:53.018
Well, I got a job as a waitress
down at the Academy,

1:04:53.101 --> 1:04:55.646
close to the neighborhood
I think that we should settle on.

1:04:56.939 --> 1:04:59.066
You like those streets
over by Larchmere, right?

1:05:04.655 --> 1:05:05.739
Baby.

1:05:06.490 --> 1:05:08.909
Yeah, baby, I'm here. I just...

1:05:11.411 --> 1:05:13.205
Are you sure you're doing okay?

1:05:13.747 --> 1:05:15.290
I just miss you. That's all.

1:05:16.375 --> 1:05:17.543
I miss you too.

1:05:19.711 --> 1:05:20.712
I love you.

1:05:22.047 --> 1:05:23.048
Fuck!

1:05:46.780 --> 1:05:49.116
Get him out! Fuck!

1:05:49.199 --> 1:05:51.326
All right! He's good!

1:06:28.697 --> 1:06:31.158
After Private First Class Jimenez
was killed in battle,

1:06:31.909 --> 1:06:34.369
this soldier went on to take care
of his platoon as well,

1:06:35.037 --> 1:06:37.956
serving three platoons in total
to complete more combat missions...

1:06:38.040 --> 1:06:40.792
-I really wanna get the fuck out of here.
-...than any other medic in his battalion.

1:06:40.876 --> 1:06:43.712
I don't feel like I've done anything
to go running into a gymnasium about.

1:06:43.795 --> 1:06:47.174
It is my honor to present to you
the Medal of Valor.

1:06:47.257 --> 1:06:49.843
My one true accomplishment was not dying.

1:06:50.511 --> 1:06:52.262
And I didn't really have anything
to do with that.

1:06:52.971 --> 1:06:55.432
-Congratulations, Specialist.
-Thank you, First Sergeant.

1:07:36.265 --> 1:07:39.893
Emily drove me back to Ohio,
and I got to see our new house.

1:08:09.131 --> 1:08:11.842
Started taking night classes
at a school Emily was working at,

1:08:11.925 --> 1:08:15.345
and I got a job
that paid eight bucks an hour.

1:08:16.638 --> 1:08:18.432
Roy's cousin Joe helped me get it.

1:08:21.935 --> 1:08:23.854
This coffee is shit.

1:08:23.937 --> 1:08:25.564
They're all spoiled fucks.

1:08:25.647 --> 1:08:28.358
No one there but Joe and I
had ever had anything to do with war

1:08:28.442 --> 1:08:29.984
or murders or anything like that.

1:08:31.069 --> 1:08:33.738
The world meant something different
to them than it did to us.

1:08:37.075 --> 1:08:39.912
And after he got back,
Joe had problems for a while.

1:08:39.995 --> 1:08:42.581
All I did was ask you if you really
needed to keep drinking,

1:08:42.663 --> 1:08:44.249
seeing as you're already shit-faced.

1:08:44.332 --> 1:08:47.461
-And I said that I did.
-And I said no, you did not!

1:08:51.590 --> 1:08:53.634
-Holy shit!
-Fuck!

1:08:55.135 --> 1:08:56.136
Stop the car.

1:09:00.057 --> 1:09:02.267
He wasn't the only one with problems.

1:09:05.479 --> 1:09:08.607
I didn't sleep.
And when I did, I dreamt of violence.

1:09:09.983 --> 1:09:11.151
Hey.

1:09:11.609 --> 1:09:12.694
Hey.

1:09:15.906 --> 1:09:17.533
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

1:09:19.576 --> 1:09:21.620
-Hey.
-What happened?

1:09:22.746 --> 1:09:25.749
I shit blood, I farted blood,
and then I craved sleep.

1:09:45.018 --> 1:09:48.647
Basically I was being a sad,
crazy fuck about the horrors I'd seen.

1:10:12.671 --> 1:10:13.881
Hurry. We'll be late.

1:10:14.840 --> 1:10:16.300
Yeah, baby. Sure.

1:10:37.779 --> 1:10:40.407
Hey, thank you for thinking to do this.

1:10:45.078 --> 1:10:46.997
Why are we the only ones dressed up?

1:10:51.502 --> 1:10:52.544
Doesn't matter.

1:10:53.754 --> 1:10:55.005
Didn't notice.

1:10:56.340 --> 1:10:58.800
All these middle-aged people with money,
for Christ's sakes.

1:10:58.884 --> 1:11:02.137
And they can't even be bothered
to wear a jacket to the fucking theater.

1:11:02.221 --> 1:11:03.972
-Stop.
-Yeah, I'm talkin' to you.

1:11:04.056 --> 1:11:05.766
-What's your problem, dude?
-Dude, what's your problem?

1:11:05.849 --> 1:11:08.185
My problem's the fact
you didn't even have the decency

1:11:08.268 --> 1:11:10.479
to take off your L.L.Bean before you came
from the fucking golf club!

1:11:10.562 --> 1:11:12.481
-Please be quiet.
-Okay, tough guy--

1:11:12.564 --> 1:11:14.650
-Fuck you, motherfucker--
-I'd really like to go now.

1:11:14.733 --> 1:11:16.068
No, babe, we're not going anywhere.

1:11:16.151 --> 1:11:17.694
I would really like to leave.

1:11:18.403 --> 1:11:20.906
It's all right, man.
There's nothing to fucking look at.

1:11:20.989 --> 1:11:22.324
This guy's just an asshole.

1:11:22.407 --> 1:11:25.661
Fucking take this L.L.Bean
and shove it up your fucking ass.

1:11:25.744 --> 1:11:26.870
Fucking pussy.

1:11:56.817 --> 1:11:57.818
I wanna leave.

1:12:02.155 --> 1:12:06.034
I punched the bathroom mirror on accident
while I was washing my hands.

1:12:07.035 --> 1:12:08.453
-Come on, we gotta go.
-Jesus Christ.

1:12:08.537 --> 1:12:10.330
I mean we gotta go right fucking now.
Let's go.

1:12:18.714 --> 1:12:21.383
And when I went home,
I took a few more Xanax.

1:12:33.896 --> 1:12:36.148
That also happened to be the night
that James Lightfoot

1:12:36.231 --> 1:12:38.483
tried coming around to welcome me back,

1:12:38.567 --> 1:12:40.736
but he got arrested
breaking into my house.

1:12:41.653 --> 1:12:42.696
Hey, man.

1:12:44.448 --> 1:12:45.449
Hey.

1:12:47.743 --> 1:12:48.827
Hey, wake up.

1:12:49.578 --> 1:12:51.330
Hey, man, what the fuck? Who's you?

1:12:51.413 --> 1:12:52.414
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

1:12:52.497 --> 1:12:53.749
Sorry--

1:12:53.832 --> 1:12:55.334
Except it wasn't my house.

1:12:55.417 --> 1:12:57.920
The fucking dumb shit
broke into the wrong house.

1:13:00.005 --> 1:13:02.716
Since I left for Iraq,
James had busted up his knee

1:13:02.799 --> 1:13:04.384
working for the Highway Department

1:13:04.468 --> 1:13:06.386
and gotten into using OxyContin
pretty bad.

1:13:06.470 --> 1:13:08.805
-I didn't mean to.
-Come on.

1:13:08.889 --> 1:13:12.351
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-Come on.

1:13:13.769 --> 1:13:15.729
You fucking pig! Fuck you!

1:13:15.812 --> 1:13:18.857
After I bailed him out,
he started hanging around a lot.

1:13:21.360 --> 1:13:23.028
Dude, are you all right?

1:13:23.111 --> 1:13:26.073
No, no. No, not all right.

1:13:26.907 --> 1:13:28.242
Help me.

1:13:29.952 --> 1:13:31.870
Fuck. Fuck.

1:13:42.339 --> 1:13:43.423
Deep breath.

1:13:55.018 --> 1:13:57.479
Deep. That's right.

1:14:03.110 --> 1:14:05.779
A few weeks later,
James asked me to take him to the bank.

1:14:19.501 --> 1:14:21.795
James wanted me
to talk to the teller for him,

1:14:21.879 --> 1:14:23.630
'cause he said I could talk good.

1:14:26.049 --> 1:14:27.050
Okay.

1:14:27.926 --> 1:14:30.012
So I'm gonna sign my checks over to you.

1:14:30.721 --> 1:14:33.015
And then you're gonna give me
the cash, okay?

1:14:34.641 --> 1:14:36.643
'Cause they won't let me have
a bank account,

1:14:37.352 --> 1:14:39.563
'cause I'm in ChexSystems.

1:14:40.272 --> 1:14:42.232
My credit's totally fucked.

1:14:43.025 --> 1:14:44.026
Come on.

1:14:45.861 --> 1:14:47.279
I can't cash these checks, sir.

1:14:47.362 --> 1:14:48.947
It wasn't exactly a smash hit.

1:14:49.031 --> 1:14:51.950
The teller thought I was being a dick
because I was high on OxyContin,

1:14:52.034 --> 1:14:55.329
and I wasn't exactly trying to hide
the fact that I thought he was an asshole.

1:14:55.412 --> 1:14:56.538
You know what?

1:14:57.247 --> 1:14:59.791
You're an asshole,
and I'd like to speak to your manager.

1:14:59.875 --> 1:15:01.543
Well, I am the manager.

1:15:04.213 --> 1:15:07.090
-Well, you're still an asshole.
-Okay.

1:15:07.174 --> 1:15:09.510
-Sir.
-I'm a fucking war veteran, dude.

1:15:09.593 --> 1:15:11.970
And you're fucking treating me
like an undesirable.

1:15:12.054 --> 1:15:13.722
I don't know what I'm gonna do about this,

1:15:13.805 --> 1:15:16.892
but I'm sure as fuck this isn't the way
you're supposed to treat people, fucker.

1:15:16.975 --> 1:15:18.352
You have a good day now.

1:15:19.102 --> 1:15:20.562
-Thanks, guys.
-Thank you.

1:15:20.646 --> 1:15:21.730
Thanks for your help.

1:15:22.856 --> 1:15:24.274
Fuck yeah. You get the money?

1:15:24.358 --> 1:15:25.901
No, I didn't get the fucking money.

1:15:33.575 --> 1:15:36.328
Hey, man, it's really unfortunate
how that all just played out.

1:15:37.538 --> 1:15:38.539
Sorry, dude.

1:15:40.791 --> 1:15:43.377
Yeah, well, thanks anyway.

1:15:43.460 --> 1:15:44.628
Sure, yeah.

1:15:47.130 --> 1:15:49.299
Do you think I could get
some more of those pills?

1:15:54.680 --> 1:15:58.517
Everything had changed.
And nothing had changed.

1:16:00.435 --> 1:16:03.230
The problem was, is I really liked Oxy.

1:16:03.313 --> 1:16:07.109
Made me feel a type of way
so I wasn't about taking shit from anyone.

1:16:07.192 --> 1:16:08.819
Where the hell have you been?

1:16:09.945 --> 1:16:11.071
No.

1:16:13.323 --> 1:16:14.700
Where have you been?

1:16:14.783 --> 1:16:16.910
You were supposed to be home
three hours ago.

1:16:16.994 --> 1:16:18.495
What the fuck did you take?

1:16:19.413 --> 1:16:21.456
What are you fucking taking?

1:16:21.540 --> 1:16:23.375
I'll tell you
what I haven't been taking...

1:16:24.209 --> 1:16:25.419
is your shit.

1:16:26.295 --> 1:16:29.381
I'm not taking your shit.

1:16:32.551 --> 1:16:35.387
I promised Emily I'd find a better way
of dealing with my war shit

1:16:35.470 --> 1:16:36.638
than just taking pills.

1:16:51.361 --> 1:16:53.947
Have you been experiencing
any suicidal thoughts?

1:16:58.327 --> 1:16:59.453
Sometimes, yeah.

1:17:01.205 --> 1:17:04.917
I just feel like if I died in Iraq...

1:17:06.210 --> 1:17:07.794
she'd be happier now, you know?

1:17:09.171 --> 1:17:11.215
She would've been sad for a while, but...

1:17:13.759 --> 1:17:15.844
ultimately her life would've been better.

1:17:19.932 --> 1:17:21.183
How long you been back?

1:17:21.266 --> 1:17:22.351
Eight months.

1:17:24.895 --> 1:17:27.064
Have you been evaluated for PTSD before?

1:17:29.399 --> 1:17:30.901
Isn't that what we're doing here?

1:17:33.779 --> 1:17:35.072
I tried.

1:17:36.281 --> 1:17:37.991
You guys kept transferring my file.

1:17:38.075 --> 1:17:41.036
I guess someone left and the new someone
was trying to get caught up.

1:17:41.119 --> 1:17:42.496
I don't know.

1:17:47.209 --> 1:17:49.044
Are you currently on any medications?

1:17:49.127 --> 1:17:50.212
Xanax.

1:17:51.505 --> 1:17:53.632
For my anxiety.
But they don't work anymore.

1:17:55.050 --> 1:17:56.176
How's your pain level?

1:17:56.927 --> 1:17:58.679
Like, mental pain or physical pain?

1:17:59.221 --> 1:18:00.222
Both.

1:18:03.141 --> 1:18:04.393
Nine outta ten.

1:18:06.937 --> 1:18:08.647
Have you ever heard of OxyContin?

1:18:12.317 --> 1:18:13.944
Naturally, Emily was pissed,

1:18:14.027 --> 1:18:16.321
and she'd understandably
reached her limit.

1:18:23.579 --> 1:18:24.746
Fine.

1:18:25.455 --> 1:18:27.499
These are for me now.

1:18:28.083 --> 1:18:30.002
Because I would love--

1:18:30.711 --> 1:18:33.297
I would love a break...

1:18:34.506 --> 1:18:37.467
from all of this shit!

1:18:40.345 --> 1:18:42.681
Fuck you!

1:18:58.155 --> 1:19:00.657
I wish I never told you I was leaving.

1:19:07.623 --> 1:19:08.790
For Montreal.

1:19:17.674 --> 1:19:21.220
Remember when you used to wear
that white ribbon around your neck?

1:19:25.265 --> 1:19:26.683
That was my jam.

1:19:29.394 --> 1:19:30.771
Yeah, I liked that.

1:19:43.450 --> 1:19:46.078
Can't see that we'll ever
make it back there though.

1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:53.043
No.

1:20:00.551 --> 1:20:02.094
But I'm okay with that.

1:20:07.891 --> 1:20:08.892
Yeah.

1:20:12.813 --> 1:20:13.897
Me too.

1:20:28.787 --> 1:20:32.499
And that is how we became addicts.

1:20:48.390 --> 1:20:50.058
Babe, how do you want your eggs?

1:20:51.018 --> 1:20:54.104
Can you walk Livinia today?
I need to leave in, like, ten minutes.

1:20:54.188 --> 1:20:55.898
You want 'em scrambled or sunny-side up?

1:20:55.981 --> 1:20:57.524
Scrambled, please. On toast.

1:20:57.608 --> 1:20:59.193
What, like, in a sandwich?

1:20:59.276 --> 1:21:01.862
Yeah, like a sandwich.

1:21:04.823 --> 1:21:09.328
The story of being a dope fiend
is that you could kill yourself real slow,

1:21:10.037 --> 1:21:12.539
but you feel like a million fucking bucks
doing it.

1:21:12.623 --> 1:21:14.041
It's okay.

1:21:14.124 --> 1:21:16.084
Hey, today's the day that I stay late.

1:21:16.168 --> 1:21:19.087
So you need to be there by 5:00,
or I'm not gonna make it through class.

1:21:19.171 --> 1:21:21.965
-Professor's still out.
-I got you, babe, go on.

1:21:22.049 --> 1:21:24.134
-You said 5:00, right?
-5:00 p.m.

1:21:24.218 --> 1:21:26.220
-Yes, ma'am.
-Thank you.

1:21:27.763 --> 1:21:30.766
At first we said we'd get a dog,
and we wouldn't be dope fiends.

1:21:30.849 --> 1:21:34.686
But we stayed dope fiends,
so now we're just dope fiends with a dog.

1:21:34.770 --> 1:21:35.812
I gotta go.

1:21:37.231 --> 1:21:39.024
-I love you.
-Love you too.

1:21:39.650 --> 1:21:40.984
Don't forget.

1:21:43.403 --> 1:21:46.782
"See her knitting in my hand,
and her empty chair ready for her.

1:21:46.865 --> 1:21:50.160
I cry with vexation and disappointment"...

1:21:50.244 --> 1:21:53.413
Lia? Keep reading,
I'm gonna run to the restroom.

1:22:06.468 --> 1:22:07.678
You good?

1:22:13.100 --> 1:22:14.810
Of course, the future looked bad though.

1:22:17.563 --> 1:22:18.814
You went into debt.

1:22:20.148 --> 1:22:24.194
My last GI check got deposited
into the wrong account. And...

1:22:24.278 --> 1:22:27.406
Stabbed your parents in the heart,
over and over and over again.

1:22:29.950 --> 1:22:33.996
Old friends stayed away. New friends would
eat your eyes out with a fucking spoon.

1:22:39.418 --> 1:22:40.544
Hey, Black.

1:22:48.844 --> 1:22:51.305
But there was always
more heroin to be done.

1:22:51.388 --> 1:22:54.433
And that would usually serve
to settle things down for a bit.

1:22:55.184 --> 1:22:57.060
If you could front me, like, another 80,

1:22:57.144 --> 1:22:59.563
I got money from the GI Bill
coming in on Friday.

1:23:06.111 --> 1:23:07.529
Flip that grilled cheese for me.

1:23:07.613 --> 1:23:08.947
If you didn't know any better,

1:23:09.031 --> 1:23:12.159
you would've thought that this guy
was Biff from Back to the Future,

1:23:12.242 --> 1:23:13.702
but he wasn't.

1:23:13.785 --> 1:23:15.370
He was Pills...

1:23:16.371 --> 1:23:17.873
and he was Coke.

1:23:20.459 --> 1:23:23.045
Hey, man, you want me to put this
on a plate? It looks done.

1:23:23.128 --> 1:23:25.464
Shelly, come get your toasted cheese.

1:23:31.136 --> 1:23:32.137
Hey.

1:23:33.722 --> 1:23:35.057
What are you guys doing?

1:23:36.141 --> 1:23:37.684
Making some special candy.

1:23:38.602 --> 1:23:39.686
I like candy.

1:23:40.395 --> 1:23:41.396
Can I try it?

1:23:43.774 --> 1:23:44.900
That depends.

1:23:45.901 --> 1:23:50.155
What do you think, junkie?
Should she try some special candy?

1:23:51.323 --> 1:23:54.493
All right, open wide for the choo choo.

1:24:00.165 --> 1:24:03.043
-Choo choo!
-And everyone you met was a fucker.

1:24:03.126 --> 1:24:06.004
Stop fucking with me, dude.
Are you really not gonna front me that 80?

1:24:06.088 --> 1:24:08.590
I don't know, man,
80 is a lot of money to some people.

1:24:08.674 --> 1:24:10.008
Please, dude, come on.

1:24:11.677 --> 1:24:14.930
Maybe. But you gotta
go see a guy in Buckeye for me.

1:24:15.013 --> 1:24:17.307
-Okay.
-Pick up something for Black.

1:24:18.183 --> 1:24:19.268
For Black?

1:24:19.351 --> 1:24:20.978
-Yeah.
-What am I picking up?

1:24:21.061 --> 1:24:23.146
It's a safe.
And don't fucking ask what's in it.

1:24:23.230 --> 1:24:24.439
Why, what's in it?

1:24:25.941 --> 1:24:27.317
You're a cunt-nugget.

1:24:29.611 --> 1:24:32.197
Please, please tell me you scored.

1:24:32.281 --> 1:24:33.949
-What the fuck is this?
-What?

1:24:34.533 --> 1:24:36.952
Pills & Coke asked me
to watch a safe for him.

1:24:37.035 --> 1:24:38.245
That fucking guy?

1:24:38.912 --> 1:24:40.080
I hate that fucking guy.

1:24:40.163 --> 1:24:43.458
That fucking guy fronted us,
so it felt like the right thing to do.

1:24:52.217 --> 1:24:53.427
Are you good?

1:24:59.933 --> 1:25:03.896
I told you that guy was a scumbag.
This dope isn't doing shit for me.

1:25:05.939 --> 1:25:10.569
And here you are watching his safe
that probably has all the good shit in it.

1:25:14.406 --> 1:25:18.035
So we called James Lightfoot,
who used to work for a locksmith.

1:25:27.878 --> 1:25:29.046
I can't hear anything.

1:25:36.637 --> 1:25:37.930
Did it work?

1:25:38.013 --> 1:25:41.433
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, it totally fucking worked. Genius.

1:25:47.272 --> 1:25:48.482
Hit it, man.

1:25:48.565 --> 1:25:50.943
-Yeah, hit it. Hit it.
-Fuck.

1:25:51.026 --> 1:25:52.319
Get angry, baby.

1:25:53.278 --> 1:25:54.655
It's coming.

1:25:56.865 --> 1:25:57.950
Fuck them.

1:25:58.575 --> 1:25:59.701
What?

1:26:29.982 --> 1:26:31.942
Open the door!

1:26:38.532 --> 1:26:39.825
It's the fucking police.

1:26:42.744 --> 1:26:43.745
It's not the police.

1:26:43.829 --> 1:26:45.622
This is the police!

1:26:46.832 --> 1:26:48.458
It's the fucking police!

1:26:50.002 --> 1:26:51.628
Get rid of all the drugs. Quick! Hurry!

1:26:52.796 --> 1:26:54.089
-Fuck!
-They know about the safe!

1:26:54.173 --> 1:26:55.507
I told you they know about the safe.

1:26:55.591 --> 1:26:57.759
I don't know how they fucking know
about the safe.

1:26:58.343 --> 1:27:00.053
-Fuck, fuck!
-What are you doing?

1:27:00.137 --> 1:27:01.972
-I'm emptying!
-That's not gonna fucking work!

1:27:02.055 --> 1:27:03.056
Fuck! Fuck!

1:27:03.140 --> 1:27:04.516
Here.

1:27:08.103 --> 1:27:09.938
-Okay, listen to me.
-Okay.

1:27:10.022 --> 1:27:12.774
Put your hands behind your head
like this, okay? Stay like that.

1:27:12.858 --> 1:27:13.984
Yeah.

1:27:16.653 --> 1:27:18.864
Let's do this nice and peaceful!

1:27:22.993 --> 1:27:24.703
Son of a bitch.

1:27:25.329 --> 1:27:26.830
What a fucking dumbass.

1:27:26.914 --> 1:27:28.123
Come on, open up.

1:27:34.129 --> 1:27:35.172
Come on in, man.

1:27:35.756 --> 1:27:37.132
Cup check.

1:27:48.060 --> 1:27:49.061
Dude.

1:27:53.732 --> 1:27:55.943
How much fucking shit was even in there?

1:27:59.488 --> 1:28:00.739
Tell me!

1:28:04.034 --> 1:28:05.035
A lot.

1:28:06.161 --> 1:28:07.162
Fuck.

1:28:07.746 --> 1:28:09.790
You said you were the fucking police,
dumbass.

1:28:11.208 --> 1:28:13.418
You fucking put this shit on me,
you doped-up fuck?

1:28:13.502 --> 1:28:15.295
It wasn't my fault! It wasn't my fault!

1:28:15.879 --> 1:28:19.800
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stop, you're gonna kill him! Stop!

1:28:30.352 --> 1:28:32.604
All right,
let me tell you what's gonna happen.

1:28:32.688 --> 1:28:36.984
Black is gonna put on his black mask.

1:28:37.067 --> 1:28:39.152
-What?
-His black mask.

1:28:39.236 --> 1:28:41.530
-What black mask? What are you--
-His black mask. His fucking black mask.

1:28:41.613 --> 1:28:43.323
He's gonna put on
his motherfucking black mask!

1:28:43.407 --> 1:28:44.825
Stop saying that!
I don't know what it means.

1:28:44.908 --> 1:28:46.368
He's gonna put on his black mask!

1:28:46.451 --> 1:28:48.078
I don't know what it means!

1:28:50.455 --> 1:28:51.665
He's gonna kill us all.

1:28:53.458 --> 1:28:54.710
He's gonna kill you.

1:28:54.793 --> 1:28:56.253
-He's gonna kill you.
-No.

1:28:56.336 --> 1:28:58.338
He's sure as fuck
gonna kill that cunt-nugget!

1:28:59.006 --> 1:29:01.675
And guess what then?
He's gonna fucking kill me.

1:29:07.222 --> 1:29:08.223
Unless...

1:29:09.016 --> 1:29:10.809
you can give me

1:29:11.560 --> 1:29:14.521
a giant fucking shitwad of cash.

1:29:15.397 --> 1:29:16.440
Right now.

1:29:18.025 --> 1:29:19.651
We don't have any money.

1:29:21.778 --> 1:29:23.447
We don't even have dog food.

1:29:25.532 --> 1:29:26.658
I have a plan.

1:29:28.744 --> 1:29:29.870
I have a plan.

1:30:48.615 --> 1:30:50.659
Okay, we're square.

1:31:17.102 --> 1:31:18.103
Oh, my God.

1:31:20.522 --> 1:31:21.732
How much did you...

1:31:24.109 --> 1:31:25.152
Oh, my God.

1:31:27.696 --> 1:31:29.239
That's a lot of fucking dope.

1:31:30.240 --> 1:31:32.117
And that was cause for a celebration.

1:32:16.119 --> 1:32:17.246
Sorry.

1:32:24.253 --> 1:32:25.254
Hello?

1:32:25.337 --> 1:32:26.755
Hey. Joe.

1:32:29.383 --> 1:32:31.885
-Joe?
-Yeah. Roy's cousin Joe.

1:32:32.427 --> 1:32:34.388
Oh, fuck. Hey, Joe, what's up, man?

1:32:34.471 --> 1:32:37.599
Hey, man, did you rob a bank today?

1:32:43.105 --> 1:32:44.523
I'm going to fucking jail, babe.

1:32:44.606 --> 1:32:48.944
No. No, here. It says the suspect
is six foot and has blue eyes.

1:32:49.027 --> 1:32:51.154
-You're okay.
-Yeah, but look at the fucking picture.

1:32:51.238 --> 1:32:52.489
Does it look like me?

1:33:00.956 --> 1:33:03.458
Yeah, maybe you shouldn't
leave the house for a while.

1:33:04.042 --> 1:33:05.961
The essential problem
of being a drug addict

1:33:06.044 --> 1:33:08.672
is that whenever you get flush,
you spend it on dope.

1:33:12.926 --> 1:33:16.221
Until the money's gone.
And when the dope's gone, you get sick.

1:33:22.186 --> 1:33:24.188
At which point
you need to find more money.

1:33:24.271 --> 1:33:26.565
Go rob another fucking bank!

1:33:34.781 --> 1:33:36.033
Are you okay?

1:33:36.575 --> 1:33:37.910
It was just a sneeze.

1:33:39.244 --> 1:33:41.705
Look, I really think you're sick, man.

1:33:41.788 --> 1:33:44.625
No, I'm fine, I just can't stop sneezing.

1:34:05.437 --> 1:34:07.648
I don't imagine that anyone
goes in for a robbery

1:34:07.731 --> 1:34:09.650
if they're not in some kind
of desperation.

1:34:10.692 --> 1:34:12.861
With robbery it's a matter
of pure abasement.

1:34:12.945 --> 1:34:14.071
Thank you.

1:34:14.154 --> 1:34:15.489
And we were abased.

1:34:18.283 --> 1:34:20.869
What's crazy is, is that 80% of the time

1:34:20.953 --> 1:34:23.038
the tellers really don't mind
if you're holding up the bank.

1:34:23.622 --> 1:34:25.040
There are exceptions, of course,

1:34:25.123 --> 1:34:27.793
like this one lady on the West Side,
looked like Janet Reno.

1:34:27.876 --> 1:34:29.795
That's as high as I go.

1:34:32.381 --> 1:34:33.632
You fucking kidding me?

1:34:38.720 --> 1:34:40.430
You can read, right?

1:34:41.014 --> 1:34:42.975
That's as high as I go.

1:34:43.934 --> 1:34:46.645
But this was a fanatic.
Usually it's very civilized.

1:34:46.728 --> 1:34:47.729
Hey, babe.

1:34:47.813 --> 1:34:49.022
You all right?

1:34:49.106 --> 1:34:52.109
-Where were you?
-I was at the bank. I couldn't get much.

1:34:52.192 --> 1:34:54.319
Feel like a fucking purse snatcher.

1:34:56.905 --> 1:35:00.117
Yeah, this is the one. All right.

1:35:05.789 --> 1:35:08.792
How is it that you can rob
all these fucking goddamn banks,

1:35:08.876 --> 1:35:11.879
and yet somehow, in some fucking way,

1:35:11.962 --> 1:35:14.673
you still owe me a fuck ton of money?

1:35:17.801 --> 1:35:19.261
What the fuck?

1:35:20.179 --> 1:35:22.097
'Cause we shoot
a lot of fucking dope, man.

1:35:22.181 --> 1:35:24.016
You need to shoot a lot less,
motherfucker,

1:35:24.099 --> 1:35:25.893
'cause when you owe me money,
I owe Black money.

1:35:25.976 --> 1:35:28.103
And Black does not like
being owed fucking money.

1:35:28.187 --> 1:35:30.814
That's good shit, right?
I'll meet you around the corner.

1:35:30.898 --> 1:35:33.483
What the fuck you talkin' about?

1:35:33.567 --> 1:35:35.402
I told you I needed a driver.

1:35:37.196 --> 1:35:38.906
You did not fucking say that.

1:35:38.989 --> 1:35:40.449
-Yeah, I did. I called you this morning.
-No, no--

1:35:40.532 --> 1:35:42.201
I said I needed a driver for the robbery.

1:35:42.284 --> 1:35:45.913
That's not what I fucking heard.
I'm not doing the junkie bank robbery.

1:35:45.996 --> 1:35:48.081
But you just said
that you owe Black money.

1:35:48.165 --> 1:35:49.625
Yeah! Because you owe me money.

1:35:49.708 --> 1:35:51.418
Do you wanna pay him back or not?

1:35:54.755 --> 1:35:56.423
We gotta discuss terms, dude.

1:35:56.507 --> 1:35:58.926
The fucking terms are simple.
I'm gonna go rob the fucking bank,

1:35:59.009 --> 1:36:01.094
you're gonna meet me round the corner
so you can pay Black back.

1:36:01.178 --> 1:36:02.429
I don't like those terms.

1:36:02.513 --> 1:36:04.264
-I may or may not be there--
-Those are the terms, man.

1:36:04.348 --> 1:36:06.558
Motherfucking piece of shit.

1:36:06.642 --> 1:36:08.227
Those are the fucking terms!

1:36:14.274 --> 1:36:16.151
Come on, Sheina,
I know you can do better than that.

1:36:16.235 --> 1:36:17.486
That's a lot of money.

1:36:18.111 --> 1:36:20.280
That's a 50 banded to some fucking ones.

1:36:20.364 --> 1:36:22.074
I said all the money in your drawer.

1:36:26.411 --> 1:36:29.665
That guy couldn't give a shit about
what's happening with you right now.

1:36:29.748 --> 1:36:31.708
I'm not fucking around.

1:36:46.181 --> 1:36:47.641
I'll flash my gun on the way out,

1:36:47.724 --> 1:36:50.352
so he knows you didn't
just give the money away.

1:36:50.435 --> 1:36:52.354
That supposed to make you a good guy now?

1:36:58.569 --> 1:37:00.612
Did you fight for this fucking country?

1:37:04.700 --> 1:37:07.160
You know what
fucking terms we never discussed?

1:37:07.244 --> 1:37:11.874
The ones where you're in my car with me,
and the motherfucking police shoot us!

1:37:12.958 --> 1:37:16.086
We never fucking discussed those terms,
you fucking junkie.

1:37:25.012 --> 1:37:27.806
Where were you? It's Wednesday.

1:37:28.432 --> 1:37:30.726
You were supposed to come down
to school and meet me by 5:00.

1:37:32.352 --> 1:37:34.813
I'm sorry, baby.
I was getting really sick.

1:37:34.897 --> 1:37:37.983
Yeah, well, now I'm sick,
and I had to cancel my fucking class

1:37:38.066 --> 1:37:40.360
because I shit my motherfucking pants.

1:37:41.862 --> 1:37:42.863
Fuck.

1:37:44.948 --> 1:37:48.619
I'm trying really hard
to do something here.

1:37:48.702 --> 1:37:50.162
I'm not just trying to...

1:37:51.205 --> 1:37:56.335
sit at home on the fucking couch,
enjoying my motherfucking high.

1:38:02.216 --> 1:38:04.343
-Fuck!
-The fuck is this?

1:38:17.439 --> 1:38:20.692
-Baby, all right, fuck.
-I can't fucking...

1:38:22.528 --> 1:38:24.738
I can't fucking do it.

1:38:26.114 --> 1:38:28.534
-It's all right, baby.
-Will you please help me?

1:38:28.617 --> 1:38:32.579
Come on, come here.
It's all right. I got you.

1:38:36.500 --> 1:38:38.544
It's all right. Here, tie yourself up.

1:38:55.143 --> 1:38:56.228
All right.

1:38:57.312 --> 1:38:58.647
Are you ready?

1:39:23.046 --> 1:39:25.757
I'm right here with you.
Would you hurry the fuck up, please?

1:39:25.841 --> 1:39:27.634
You gotta calm down and let us do our job.

1:39:27.718 --> 1:39:29.970
Baby? I'm right here.
I'm right by your side.

1:39:30.053 --> 1:39:32.890
I'm not gonna fucking leave you, okay?
I got you. Okay?

1:39:34.016 --> 1:39:37.936
Female, 22.
Agonal breathing, pinpoint pupils.

1:39:38.020 --> 1:39:39.688
-Please.
-Rapid heart rate...

1:39:39.771 --> 1:39:41.857
I just got to be here with my wife.

1:39:41.940 --> 1:39:43.859
Sir, I need you to go to the waiting room.

1:39:43.942 --> 1:39:45.694
Okay, I can go.
But could you please just--

1:39:45.777 --> 1:39:47.571
-Can I stay for five minutes?
-No, listen.

1:39:47.654 --> 1:39:49.990
There's nothing you can do in here
but get in the way.

1:39:50.073 --> 1:39:51.867
Sir. There's nothing you can do.

1:39:51.950 --> 1:39:53.243
Okay, I'm going.

1:39:53.327 --> 1:39:54.995
-Oh, Jesus.
-Ready, go.

1:39:55.078 --> 1:39:57.789
-No response here.
-Take over the airway.

1:39:57.873 --> 1:39:59.333
Hooking up the monitor.

1:39:59.416 --> 1:40:02.419
-We're gonna do the best we can.
-I don't know what I would do without her.

1:40:02.503 --> 1:40:04.254
Okay? We're gonna do the best we can.

1:40:04.338 --> 1:40:05.589
Emily, I'm outside, baby.

1:40:06.173 --> 1:40:08.091
I need you to calm down
and tell me what happened.

1:40:08.675 --> 1:40:10.135
I don't know what happened.

1:40:11.887 --> 1:40:12.930
Help me out here.

1:40:13.013 --> 1:40:15.307
I need you to calm down
and tell me what happened.

1:40:16.725 --> 1:40:18.393
We were home and we fell asleep,

1:40:18.477 --> 1:40:20.521
and then she fucking woke up
and she was blue.

1:40:20.604 --> 1:40:22.314
-How long was she unconscious?
-I don't know.

1:40:22.397 --> 1:40:23.565
What did she take?

1:40:24.650 --> 1:40:26.151
-I don't know.
-What did she take?

1:40:26.235 --> 1:40:28.654
I don't know, ma'am. I don't fucking know.

1:40:28.737 --> 1:40:31.448
Listen, help us help her.
I need to know what she took.

1:40:31.532 --> 1:40:33.992
Can you please just tell me
if she's breathing or not?

1:40:34.493 --> 1:40:35.994
Please, I'm a medic, ma'am.

1:40:36.078 --> 1:40:39.414
We're trying the best that we can, okay?
I need you to tell me what she took.

1:40:39.498 --> 1:40:42.251
Paging Dr. Staman. Dr. Staman, please.

1:40:42.835 --> 1:40:44.211
She took heroin.

1:40:50.259 --> 1:40:51.885
I love you.

1:40:55.013 --> 1:40:56.890
I know you've got problems.

1:41:00.769 --> 1:41:02.604
I know you're broken.

1:41:05.482 --> 1:41:07.776
But please don't break my daughter.

1:41:13.031 --> 1:41:14.408
If you love her...

1:41:17.244 --> 1:41:19.162
then you'll be a man and walk away.

1:41:24.918 --> 1:41:27.713
You get up and walk away.

1:41:32.342 --> 1:41:33.886
Or I'll fuck you up.

1:42:27.022 --> 1:42:28.941
Fuck! Fuck you!

1:42:29.024 --> 1:42:31.068
Fuck!

1:43:44.808 --> 1:43:46.518
-What the fuck are you doing?
-Hold on.

1:43:46.602 --> 1:43:48.729
-Hey, is this bus going to Elba?
-What the fuck are you doing?

1:43:48.812 --> 1:43:49.897
Hey, get back on the bus, Em.

1:43:49.980 --> 1:43:51.773
-What the fuck are you doing?
-Emily, get back on the bus.

1:43:51.857 --> 1:43:53.317
I'm not getting back on that fucking bus!

1:43:53.400 --> 1:43:54.818
-Listen to me, Emily.
-What the--

1:43:56.820 --> 1:43:59.198
Baby, fucking listen to me, all right?

1:43:59.781 --> 1:44:01.533
-Hey, are you all right?
-Yeah, I'm all right.

1:44:01.617 --> 1:44:02.743
-Sorry.
-Just don't touch her, bro.

1:44:02.826 --> 1:44:04.244
Yes, sir. Understood.

1:44:12.628 --> 1:44:14.379
Emily, you gotta go back to rehab.

1:44:16.381 --> 1:44:17.674
I don't wanna be in rehab.

1:44:20.302 --> 1:44:21.386
I wanna be with you.

1:44:24.264 --> 1:44:25.766
You can't be here with me.

1:44:25.849 --> 1:44:27.684
That's not your decision to make.

1:44:29.353 --> 1:44:31.480
-Yes, it is my decision--
-No, it's not your decision to make.

1:44:31.563 --> 1:44:32.981
-Yes, it is my--
-It's not--

1:44:33.065 --> 1:44:36.527
-Yes, it is!
-It is not your decision to make!

1:44:42.866 --> 1:44:46.370
I waited two years...

1:44:47.412 --> 1:44:50.082
for you to come back from that hellhole.

1:44:50.165 --> 1:44:51.416
Two years.

1:44:53.919 --> 1:44:56.797
And I stayed with you
through so much fucked-up shit.

1:45:02.636 --> 1:45:04.721
And I really don't wanna do this alone.

1:45:06.265 --> 1:45:08.100
Please don't make me do this alone.

1:45:10.894 --> 1:45:14.022
I'm so sorry... but I can't.

1:45:14.106 --> 1:45:15.524
I'm not good for you.

1:45:16.608 --> 1:45:18.110
I'm not good for anything.

1:45:22.281 --> 1:45:23.949
I have this noise in my head.

1:45:26.368 --> 1:45:27.744
I can't...

1:45:27.828 --> 1:45:29.663
-Baby, stop.
-It's so goddamn loud,

1:45:29.746 --> 1:45:32.040
and I can't make it stop.

1:45:33.250 --> 1:45:34.251
It'll stop.

1:45:35.002 --> 1:45:38.088
One day it'll just-- it'll go quiet.

1:45:46.388 --> 1:45:48.432
Can you please just get back on the bus?

1:45:50.058 --> 1:45:51.059
For me?

1:45:57.524 --> 1:45:59.484
I'm gonna get high with or without you.

1:46:04.239 --> 1:46:05.324
Please don't.

1:46:07.284 --> 1:46:08.535
Please, baby, just...

1:46:13.957 --> 1:46:15.167
I'm gonna get high.

1:47:09.888 --> 1:47:12.933
It's not even that interesting. The bank's
not gonna fight you over the cash.

1:47:13.016 --> 1:47:15.894
They don't even care.
It's like taking sand from a beach.

1:47:17.980 --> 1:47:20.566
-But it's somebody's money.
-No, it's the bank's money.

1:47:21.149 --> 1:47:23.235
Do you need the money
or do you not need the money?

1:47:23.318 --> 1:47:24.528
Of course I need the money.

1:47:24.611 --> 1:47:27.364
All right, well, I can get a lot more
if we hit all the tellers.

1:47:27.447 --> 1:47:29.241
But to hit all the tellers, I need you.

1:47:30.200 --> 1:47:32.995
But if we're both pulling the robbery,
why am I only getting 10%?

1:47:34.955 --> 1:47:37.749
Because I'm the one doing
all the talking and carrying the gun.

1:47:37.833 --> 1:47:41.003
All right? If you were carrying the gun
and threatening all the innocents,

1:47:41.086 --> 1:47:42.796
it'd be a different story, huh?

1:47:42.880 --> 1:47:44.631
-Then give me the gun.
-No, I'm not gonna give you the gun.

1:47:44.715 --> 1:47:46.633
-You just said if I had the gun--
-I don't care what I just said!

1:47:46.717 --> 1:47:48.093
We're gonna do what we originally agreed.

1:47:48.177 --> 1:47:51.597
Jesus. Can you stop being
such a flaming fucking pussy, dude?

1:47:57.644 --> 1:47:59.188
Fuck it, let's do it.

1:48:03.734 --> 1:48:05.444
No alarms! I said no alarms!

1:48:05.527 --> 1:48:09.531
Sir, don't you touch that fucking phone!
Don't you touch that phone!

1:48:11.617 --> 1:48:14.536
All right, I want everybody
to give their money to this man here.

1:48:23.754 --> 1:48:25.839
Don't you touch that fucking phone.

1:48:28.634 --> 1:48:29.635
Fuck!

1:48:31.345 --> 1:48:34.348
Go, go, go! Go, go!

1:48:36.683 --> 1:48:37.809
The fuck, man?

1:48:37.893 --> 1:48:40.437
-The fuck is wrong with you?
-Fucking infamous.

1:48:40.521 --> 1:48:43.315
-Man, I'm sorry.
-What do we do now?

1:48:43.398 --> 1:48:44.775
I don't fucking know.

1:48:44.858 --> 1:48:46.360
How about we do it again?

1:48:46.443 --> 1:48:48.320
I can drive,
and you and Pills do the robbing.

1:48:48.403 --> 1:48:50.948
So now I've gotta rob a bank
'cause you're a fucking pussy?

1:48:51.031 --> 1:48:52.824
I'm just not good at robberies.

1:48:52.908 --> 1:48:55.744
Pills, look,
it's three, four times the money.

1:48:57.871 --> 1:48:59.706
Fucking nerves are shot, man.

1:49:01.375 --> 1:49:02.417
Come on, man.

1:49:04.086 --> 1:49:05.712
All right, but I'm having the gun.

1:49:05.796 --> 1:49:08.298
-No, you're not having the gun.
-I am! I'm having the fucking gun!

1:49:08.382 --> 1:49:10.133
And you're a junkie motherfucker.

1:49:11.802 --> 1:49:13.011
With PTSD.

1:49:22.521 --> 1:49:24.064
The fuck is going on with you, man?

1:49:24.648 --> 1:49:26.608
-Probably the Klonnie.
-What Klonnie?

1:49:27.651 --> 1:49:29.945
-My nerves were shot, man.
-You took fucking Klonnie?

1:49:30.028 --> 1:49:31.113
Just some.

1:49:31.780 --> 1:49:33.156
-Are you good for this?
-I'm good.

1:49:33.240 --> 1:49:34.783
Are you good for this?

1:49:34.867 --> 1:49:36.869
I'm good, motherfucker. Let's do this.

1:49:36.952 --> 1:49:38.161
Put that fucking down.

1:49:40.372 --> 1:49:42.749
All right, everyone,
give your man this money.

1:49:43.876 --> 1:49:45.085
Now!

1:49:45.752 --> 1:49:46.753
Shit.

1:49:48.088 --> 1:49:50.132
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Give me the fucking gun.

1:49:50.215 --> 1:49:52.634
-Fuck, man.
-Take this, get the fucking cash and go.

1:49:52.718 --> 1:49:54.511
-Ma'am, get off the fucking phone!
-Get down.

1:50:06.899 --> 1:50:08.609
-Go, go.
-Come on. Come on.

1:50:11.278 --> 1:50:13.697
What happened? Did you shoot somebody?

1:50:14.781 --> 1:50:17.409
-No.
-Where's Pills & Coke?

1:50:17.492 --> 1:50:20.245
He fucking bailed, man. He bailed.

1:50:20.329 --> 1:50:22.289
Where you going?
What the fuck are you doing?

1:50:22.372 --> 1:50:24.124
Get the fucking-- Fuck.

1:50:24.666 --> 1:50:26.418
Everybody, give me your cash.

1:50:26.502 --> 1:50:29.630
Open the fucking drawer.
Get it out now! Hurry up.

1:50:29.713 --> 1:50:30.797
Fuck.

1:50:32.174 --> 1:50:34.968
We can't leave him.
He's gonna rat on us in a heartbeat, dude.

1:50:35.052 --> 1:50:36.553
We gotta go back and get him.

1:50:37.429 --> 1:50:38.931
-No.
-What do you mean, no, James?

1:50:39.014 --> 1:50:40.557
Turn the fucking car around!

1:50:41.058 --> 1:50:42.059
Fuck.

1:50:54.571 --> 1:50:56.281
Never lock a gunman in
with innocent people.

1:50:56.365 --> 1:50:58.867
You're supposed to lock me
in between the fucking doors.

1:50:58.951 --> 1:51:01.245
What's the matter with you people?
Are you retarded?

1:51:02.329 --> 1:51:06.834
-James, turn this fucking car around! Now!
-No.

1:51:07.417 --> 1:51:10.170
Okay. Okay.

1:51:10.254 --> 1:51:12.256
The police are on their way.

1:51:16.093 --> 1:51:18.679
Open the door right now.

1:51:21.265 --> 1:51:23.100
Look, you've put all these people's lives
in danger.

1:51:23.183 --> 1:51:25.978
If you don't open that fucking door,
your boss is gonna fire you.

1:51:27.938 --> 1:51:29.189
What the fuck was that?

1:51:29.273 --> 1:51:31.316
-I don't like this.
-Did you hear that?

1:51:31.400 --> 1:51:33.485
I don't like this, man. I don't like this.

1:51:34.069 --> 1:51:35.320
You see him?

1:51:45.622 --> 1:51:48.375
Is that him? I see him.
That's him, that's him. Stop the car.

1:51:50.878 --> 1:51:52.629
Dude, get in the fucking car. Come on.

1:51:53.130 --> 1:51:57.259
The fuck are you doing?
Get in the fucking car now!

1:52:00.262 --> 1:52:01.847
Get in the car.

1:52:03.098 --> 1:52:04.099
Fuck.

1:52:04.600 --> 1:52:05.601
Go.

1:52:06.268 --> 1:52:08.145
The fuck is wrong with you, man?

1:52:10.397 --> 1:52:11.732
This is all your fault.

1:52:11.815 --> 1:52:13.525
Should never have fucking brought you.

1:52:21.950 --> 1:52:23.535
Oh, shit.

1:52:25.120 --> 1:52:26.496
Oh, fuck.

1:52:26.580 --> 1:52:28.540
-He's been shot, man.
-What the fuck?

1:52:28.624 --> 1:52:31.376
-He's been fucking shot.
-You said nobody fucking got shot.

1:52:31.460 --> 1:52:33.504
Put some pressure on the wound, all right?

1:52:33.587 --> 1:52:36.006
Here. Let me feel your back. Let me see.

1:52:36.089 --> 1:52:38.008
Let me see. Hang on. I know.
I know it hurts.

1:52:38.091 --> 1:52:40.177
You know how to take care of him, right?

1:52:41.094 --> 1:52:42.387
Fuck, there's not an exit wound.

1:52:42.471 --> 1:52:45.140
-We gotta get him to a hospital.
-We can't go to the hospital.

1:52:45.224 --> 1:52:48.602
James, if we don't take him
to the fucking hospital, he's gonna die!

1:52:48.685 --> 1:52:50.521
We can't go right now, man!
You're not listening to me!

1:52:50.604 --> 1:52:51.855
They'll fucking arrest us!

1:52:51.939 --> 1:52:54.983
We just robbed a fucking bank,
are you fucking crazy?

1:52:55.067 --> 1:52:57.778
They've seen you plenty of fucking times!

1:52:57.861 --> 1:53:00.489
So you need to think fucking straight
about this!

1:53:00.572 --> 1:53:02.699
What do we do? What do we do?

1:53:03.242 --> 1:53:05.744
Please just take me to the hospital, man.

1:53:07.621 --> 1:53:09.665
-Take me to the hospital.
-I'm sorry.

1:53:09.748 --> 1:53:10.749
I'm sorry, man.

1:53:13.168 --> 1:53:14.169
Guys...

1:53:14.253 --> 1:53:17.381
We can't. You know we can't.
You know we can't, right?

1:53:17.464 --> 1:53:19.341
-Right?
-Guys...

1:53:19.424 --> 1:53:20.509
What can we do?

1:53:20.592 --> 1:53:22.261
What can we do?

1:53:22.344 --> 1:53:23.637
Please, man.

1:53:27.724 --> 1:53:28.934
I'm sorry.

1:53:29.601 --> 1:53:31.395
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1:53:38.443 --> 1:53:40.070
Just fucking drive, man.

1:53:40.153 --> 1:53:41.864
Okay. Okay.

1:53:41.947 --> 1:53:43.323
Just get us outta here.

1:53:48.829 --> 1:53:50.581
This is so fucked up.

1:53:56.211 --> 1:53:58.255
We never did find out how he got shot.

1:54:00.799 --> 1:54:02.342
But it didn't matter.

1:54:39.004 --> 1:54:40.172
Come on.

1:54:41.215 --> 1:54:42.216
Come on.

1:55:58.125 --> 1:55:59.501
What is he doing here?

1:56:01.628 --> 1:56:03.297
-Go inside.
-What does he want?

1:56:03.380 --> 1:56:04.673
Just go inside, baby.

1:56:13.432 --> 1:56:15.726
If you're gonna shoot me,
can we go somewhere else?

1:56:18.478 --> 1:56:19.563
You know...

1:56:21.857 --> 1:56:23.025
for the neighbors.

1:56:24.943 --> 1:56:26.778
I'm not gonna shoot you.

1:56:30.741 --> 1:56:32.951
I won't get my money back...

1:56:34.494 --> 1:56:35.787
if I shoot you.

1:56:42.085 --> 1:56:43.545
I can't do this anymore.

1:56:43.629 --> 1:56:46.048
-Sure you can.
-I can't.

1:56:48.342 --> 1:56:49.426
You can.

1:56:51.929 --> 1:56:55.349
For your girl... you can.

1:57:04.816 --> 1:57:06.610
I just gotta get right first.

1:57:41.436 --> 1:57:42.604
Hey, guess what.

1:57:52.739 --> 1:57:56.368
Black is gonna drive for me
so I can pay him back.

1:58:00.122 --> 1:58:01.498
Did he front you?

1:58:07.629 --> 1:58:08.630
Yeah.

1:58:14.178 --> 1:58:16.096
Can you make me a shot?

1:58:19.057 --> 1:58:20.392
I'm just...

1:58:23.228 --> 1:58:24.688
just really tired.

1:58:26.481 --> 1:58:27.649
I know, baby.

1:58:29.943 --> 1:58:32.404
-I want it to be quiet.
-I know.

1:58:36.325 --> 1:58:38.702
Can you give me another shot?

1:58:45.792 --> 1:58:47.753
Yeah, baby, when I'm back.

1:58:53.467 --> 1:58:55.385
When I get back, baby.

1:59:01.642 --> 1:59:02.809
I love you.

1:59:06.647 --> 1:59:07.981
I love you too.

1:59:40.472 --> 1:59:42.140
You know where you're going, right?

1:59:42.224 --> 1:59:43.892
Make the first three lefts,
can't go wrong.

1:59:43.976 --> 1:59:45.602
I'm not gonna be long,
two, three minutes, tops.

1:59:45.686 --> 1:59:47.980
And don't be late.
I'll meet you in the parking lot.

1:59:54.528 --> 1:59:58.532
Give me my fucking money, Vanessa!
Hurry the fuck up!

1:59:58.615 --> 2:00:00.284
Slide it over! Now!

2:00:22.848 --> 2:00:25.058
Vanessa, I need you to do me a favor.

2:00:26.727 --> 2:00:27.895
What's that?

2:00:29.313 --> 2:00:31.064
I need you to hit that alarm for me.

2:00:35.611 --> 2:00:37.446
It's all right. I'm not gonna hurt you.

2:00:51.293 --> 2:00:52.336
Thank you.

2:01:33.752 --> 2:01:34.837
Here's your--

2:09:47.704 --> 2:09:51.375
Therefore, it is our vote to grant parole.
Effective immediately.

2:09:53.168 --> 2:09:56.338
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
My client is most appreciative.

2:09:58.173 --> 2:09:59.299
Thank you.

2:10:00.551 --> 2:10:01.760
Thank you so much.

2:10:41.675 --> 2:10:42.926
Good luck.
