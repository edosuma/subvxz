They have given up.

10:55.738 --> 10:58.606

well, you know.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.399

12:50.687 --> 12:55.102

completely out of pure kindness.

13:48.202 --> 13:50.285

14:50.681 --> 14:51.967
Oh, You do not play my game ...

14:52.141 --> 14:56.727
This will happen if you do not

14:59.190 --> 15:00.556
He will come and the place here ...

15:00.733 --> 15:02.690

and a Q-tip to investigate.

15:02.944 --> 15:05.687
He finds here more
Bacteria on a squat toilet, ...

15:05.863 --> 15:07.479

15:19.210 --> 15:21.122
Hey, so good to see you.
We meet on Sunday after ...

15:21.337 --> 15:23.420

Your mom makes the pot roast?

15:23.673 --> 15:25.029
Ok! Ok!

15:25.049 --> 15:26.506
I love the pot roast.

15:26.801 --> 15:28.963
Ok. What do you want to know?

15:29.345 --> 15:32.554
Why was the boy's butt
spanking, on your parking.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.415
I do not know. Two major types
came in here at night.

15:35.435 --> 15:39.475
They have dragged him outside.
The type that has seen it all.

15:40.773 --> 15:44.357
He runs away. Now I have afterwards.
I hate to run after.

15:46.320 --> 15:47.652
Wash yourself 'times.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.779
Hey, You can not be back here.

15:52.869 --> 15:56.613
That was totally inappropriate.
I wanted to perform only one call.

15:57.498 --> 15:59.740
Well, you're still here, so ...

16:08.885 --> 16:10.877
Oh, you little punk ...

16:38.331 --> 16:40.869
Something was definitely wrong.
And if it does not feel right, ...

16:41.125 --> 16:42.787
... I trust my
Stomach and call a professional.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.576
So you know that you
is on the safe side.

16:48.674 --> 16:49.739
And?

16:49.759 --> 16:50.823
No bomb.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.004
Did you checked the ignition?

Fender checked, ok?

16:58.726 --> 17:01.139
Can you please stop me
to say how my job is running.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.065
Both fenders?

17:26.045 --> 17:29.004
Do you know when the last time a
Car exploded in front of me? Never.

17:29.257 --> 17:32.000
Mutz has tricked me. I sat
a long time behind the desk.

17:32.301 --> 17:34.759
Now I realize: someone does not want to,
that I ask questions.

17:35.054 --> 17:38.297
I do not want that you ask.
When Eric Skanz finds out ...

17:38.474 --> 17:41.182
... We are two unemployed.
We both had a deal.

17:41.394 --> 17:42.601
That was not my deal.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.011
I saved your job.

17:44.313 --> 17:45.520
Oh, you call that a job?

17:45.731 --> 17:47.964
Do you want to get silly to me now?
- You want me abhefte what?

17:47.984 --> 17:49.465
I'll always

17:49.485 --> 17:50.896
Stop that!

17:52.863 --> 17:54.604
I'll need a car.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.614
Grab some one from the junkyard.

17:56.784 --> 18:01.245

That's Skanzs company logo.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.155
Let me ask questions!

18:03.332 --> 18:05.324
No, we do not talk again
about Eric Skanz ...

18:06.586 --> 18:08.327
... And I've never seen.

18:08.754 --> 18:12.043
I've sniffed two minutes
and someone blows up my car?

18:12.383 --> 18:14.875
What should I do? Behind 'm
Desk sitting, bored?

18:15.595 --> 18:20.010
Yes, you want to Skanz
hunt again? You're sick.

18:20.725 --> 18:23.308
All they out there
to say about yourself, right.

18:23.728 --> 18:26.061
When it's finally in
Your wooden skull pure, ...

18:26.272 --> 18:28.639
... I like
no longer can protect.

18:28.983 --> 18:34.604
Are you doing, you're doing it alone.
This time I protect myself.

18:35.489 --> 18:38.653
I have a family
and to safeguard my pension.

18:39.243 --> 18:40.199
What is that?

18:40.369 --> 18:41.767
A service serviceability assessment.

18:41.787 --> 18:45.497
Oh come on. A psychiatrist?
Tony, Treat me a break.

18:45.875 --> 18:47.161

Ok.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.634
Copy of the death certificate.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.125
This chain was my only chance,
to solve the case, ...

19:30.294 --> 19:33.878
... But I did not like.
I'm rusty.

19:34.256 --> 19:36.339
Kenny was in the hospital,
my car has exploded ...

19:36.550 --> 19:39.088
... And I should go to a psychiatrist.

19:39.720 --> 19:42.053
Captain Murray took
all this is not serious ...

19:42.306 --> 19:44.218
I had to find out why.

19:48.813 --> 19:52.682
I'm Rick Dancer, a detective ...

19:55.277 --> 19:57.690
... No matter. Is Dr. Nicole Jackson there?

19:58.072 --> 20:00.655
Ruby, Carry the door not

20:01.659 --> 20:02.695
... Detective Dancer?

20:02.952 --> 20:05.069
Ah. Come in.

20:05.371 --> 20:10.287
Please excuse!
At the station, nothing was free.

20:11.919 --> 20:15.788
As you know, the purpose of a
Service serviceability assessment ...

20:16.048 --> 20:19.883
... Find out if you are able,
Fulfill its mandate.

20:20.261 --> 20:22.218
You want to know

20:22.513 --> 20:24.880
Are you crazy? Would be super,
if you give me the ...

20:25.141 --> 20:27.599
... Could just say,
would save us a lot of time.

20:27.893 --> 20:31.386
Your file shows that here
Signs of victimhood, ..

20:31.689 --> 20:35.023
... Compulsive urge,
chronic apathy ...

20:35.359 --> 20:36.816
English, you speak English.

20:37.111 --> 20:38.477
You are a wreck.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.553
Who is not?
I mean, I have problems ...

20:40.573 --> 20:42.155
I mean, I knew something ...

20:42.408 --> 20:46.493
... I am addressed incorrectly,
it cost me my marriage.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.203
Now we are at the bottom. Can You See It?

20:48.456 --> 20:51.119
We are making progress, ok?
Have you ever lost everything, huh?

20:51.459 --> 20:54.372
It makes a complete.
Can you give a symptom?

20:54.962 --> 20:58.330
Well, in this case it could not be
really to me. It's about you.

20:58.632 --> 20:59.748
Excellent.

21:00.050 --> 21:03.088
And just for the record:
I do not think you're crazy.

21:03.387 --> 21:05.174
I think that you
no responsibility ...

21:05.473 --> 21:07.760
... Can take care of themselves,

21:08.267 --> 21:10.930
You are unsure of selfish
and you are quarrelsome.

21:11.645 --> 21:14.137
Does that mean you want
not go to the ball?

21:15.107 --> 21:18.396
You need to
worry again about something.

21:21.197 --> 21:22.859
What do you think
from a partner?

21:23.157 --> 21:24.614
They said I can
not take care of myself.

21:24.867 --> 21:26.859
How am I supposed responsibility
take over for another?

21:27.161 --> 21:28.493
Exactly!

21:28.746 --> 21:29.827
What?

21:31.415 --> 21:33.122
One Moment ...

21:34.293 --> 21:44.292
Yes? ... No, I'm not doing anything. Oh ...
Yeah, yeah sure it's him?

21:45.262 --> 21:51.930
No, I'll do it, thank you Audrey!
Ok, I have to go.

21:52.394 --> 21:54.511
Detective Dancer, we are
not far from the end.

21:54.939 --> 21:58.057
Yes, that was great. I feel the healing.
That was a good start ...

21:58.317 --> 21:59.478
We have not even started.

21:59.819 --> 22:00.775
The tree will grow ...

22:01.153 --> 22:02.314
make next time
we the Rorschach test.

22:02.613 --> 22:03.945
I have dark thoughts.
We talk about all that ...

22:04.281 --> 22:08.241
... I can breathe. I feel myself
groundbreaking. Good Work!

22:15.876 --> 22:21.167
Dr Jackson for Captain Murray ...
Hi Captain Murray.

22:22.341 --> 22:25.209
No, actually, it went quite well ...

22:25.678 --> 22:31.549
I think he's ready,
I do not know if she's ready.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.601
Hey you, come, '' over here.

22:40.609 --> 22:42.396

22:42.862 --> 22:44.524
I'm a cop, come forth!

22:48.742 --> 22:49.778
I plug 'in trouble?

22:50.160 --> 22:52.573
No, I do. Can
I ask you 'ne question?

22:52.913 --> 22:55.030
Do you belong to the
Good or the Evil One?

22:55.833 --> 22:57.699
And?
- I think 'after.

22:58.043 --> 23:00.706
How old are you, 12?
What do you want to become?

23:01.171 --> 23:03.083
Catwomen or yet
Wonder Women prefer?

23:03.549 --> 23:08.044
Darth Vader or Obi-Wan Kenobi?
Captain Kirk or Khan?

23:08.637 --> 23:10.344
I do not know these people.

23:10.848 --> 23:13.306
Is ok, I am already old.
Let's try it.

23:13.684 --> 23:16.267
I'll give you 10 mice
and you will help me?

23:16.729 --> 23:17.685
Twenty.

23:18.147 --> 23:22.107
Twenty. Okay. I like your style.
You have to do.

23:30.451 --> 23:31.487
No.

23:43.631 --> 23:45.463
Hi.

23:47.259 --> 23:50.218
Be careful!

23:52.056 --> 23:54.594
Hey Dancer, good to see you.
How did you get so fast ...

23:55.017 --> 23:57.805
... Come here?
You can move so fast?

23:58.312 --> 24:01.350
The question is Mutz as
quickly you can move?

24:03.442 --> 24:06.276
Man, I love this
Highways. You also Mutz?

24:06.487 --> 24:09.070
Dancer, You must not do that, OK?

24:09.281 --> 24:11.318
I'll tell you everything
Want to know.

24:11.867 --> 24:13.904
No, you're not ready.
Your head is not free.

24:14.203 --> 24:17.571
Do you know how you define your
Make clear head? With running!

24:18.123 --> 24:20.456
Come on man. Drive slowly.
I slip 'out.

24:20.834 --> 24:22.416
Give me a name Mutz.
Who hired you?

24:22.795 --> 24:25.003
Dancer, he kills me,
if I tell you.

24:25.381 --> 24:27.873
Concentrate on
Your current situation.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.551
It was Mongrel!

24:34.139 --> 24:36.005
Flap, I'm trying to think.

24:37.142 --> 24:39.350
What I do not understand,
I had no quarrel with Mongrel.

24:39.687 --> 24:41.804
He's just a racket on demand.
Who rushed him to me?

24:42.147 --> 24:45.481
How should I know that?
He gave me 200 mice ...

24:45.943 --> 24:47.309
... So I bring you into the club.

24:47.611 --> 24:49.068
I did not know,
that he wants to kill you.

24:49.446 --> 24:50.719
You have me already give more ...

24:50.739 --> 24:52.321
... Or we'll see how you
You're on the highway.

24:52.574 --> 24:54.110
I know nothing else.

24:54.743 --> 24:55.733
Ok, Road Trip.

24:56.078 --> 25:03.326
Ok, Ok, Ok ... Mongrel
said what wash of money.

25:03.711 --> 25:04.792
You mean money laundering.

25:05.129 --> 25:07.872
Money laundering in any warehouse.

25:08.298 --> 25:09.288
Skanzs Warehouse?

25:09.550 --> 25:11.633
I do not know, who cares?

25:12.011 --> 25:13.547
What Kenny Basset has to do with it?

25:13.929 --> 25:16.797
There were 200 mice. That's all I know.

25:17.391 --> 25:19.348
I swear, all I know!

25:22.354 --> 25:26.940
Ok. Good work Mutz.

25:29.737 --> 25:36.234
Thank Dancer, but You take me
already back in the city, right?

25:36.869 --> 25:38.576
What do you think?

25:41.331 --> 25:47.043
Dancer, Dancer, I
do not know where we are.

25:54.928 --> 25:56.715
It was at the time a
desperate attempt to start.

25:57.056 --> 25:58.245
I had to confront Skanz ...

25:58.265 --> 26:00.097
Shake the tree and
look what falls down.

26:00.434 --> 26:03.393
Just then gave me life
a nice slap in the face.

26:03.771 --> 26:04.807
Skanz's Warehouse Benefit Gala,

26:05.147 --> 26:07.480
What you have now in front, Skanz?

26:13.072 --> 26:16.816
Hey, you doing fine?
You sound miserable.

26:17.201 --> 26:20.239
No, I'm just so tired.

26:20.662 --> 26:24.781
Tell me about it. My
Feet do dogs moderately hurt.

26:25.667 --> 26:26.657
What is that?

26:26.877 --> 26:27.993
2-28, you have now a partner.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.537
A partner? White
Murray about it?

26:30.964 --> 26:32.000
I'm afraid so.

26:32.883 --> 26:34.715
That's what the doctor wanted.

26:37.638 --> 26:39.095
Dog Pathetic.

26:52.277 --> 26:54.064
Commissioner Barbie?

26:54.488 --> 26:56.150
Fast, it's Princess.

26:56.573 --> 26:59.407
Okay Princess. I
do it quickly and painlessly.

26:59.743 --> 27:01.075
That will never happen here.

27:01.829 --> 27:03.286
Good news Cowboy ...

27:03.497 --> 27:05.739
I am not your partner. It is her.

27:07.376 --> 27:08.742
That must be a mistake.

27:08.919 --> 27:10.581
No, this is your card number.

27:10.963 --> 27:12.374
ID? It's a dog.

27:13.048 --> 27:15.040
Looks like you get
a respite, Small.

27:16.343 --> 27:17.299
What did it matter?

27:17.594 --> 27:20.632
It is not an "it". She is
Police officer, just as you and I.

27:21.306 --> 27:23.263
I will make you pay to feed,
not to analyze it.

27:23.559 --> 27:26.393
Hey, she's a good cop,
best nose of the state.

27:26.770 --> 27:29.478
Nose? What do you mean? They
sniffs things and find them?

27:29.815 --> 27:34.025
It is something challenging,
But what woman is not?

27:34.987 --> 27:37.980
Adjust merely on with her baby.
She is very sensitive so.

27:38.407 --> 27:39.363
Is she still get pregnant?

27:39.700 --> 27:46.914
What? No, the stuffed animal, her baby.
You do not know much about dogs or?

27:50.502 --> 27:51.743
Or women?

27:56.049 --> 28:01.420
Break In there before someone sees us.
What should I do? THERE wear?

28:03.515 --> 28:07.008
Ok, you can sit up front,
You can sit in the back.

28:07.436 --> 28:09.553
I'm concerned, you can also drive.

28:10.480 --> 28:13.063
Go ahead, that's
what between me and her.

28:13.442 --> 28:15.229
But let 'us
make one thing clear.

28:15.527 --> 28:16.859
I'm the man, You're the dog.

28:17.237 --> 28:21.527
I'm the cop, you're a dog.
I speak, with a dog.

28:28.916 --> 28:29.872
Dr. Jackson.

28:30.250 --> 28:32.242
I do not know what you
hereby wish to bring Miss.

28:33.003 --> 28:35.245
Detective Dancer works,
to his social skills.

28:35.756 --> 28:37.588
You see, I'm not crazy.
I'm just angry.

28:37.966 --> 28:40.003
Yes this is good. You and the
Dog have something in common.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.293
Oh. So that's a joke,
allot me a dog, ...

28:42.554 --> 28:44.136
... Who has a mental problem.

28:44.640 --> 28:47.383
Detective, you had
Flashcards push around.

28:48.018 --> 28:49.179
This is my livelihood.

28:49.353 --> 28:50.685
Yes, but there is no life.

28:51.021 --> 28:52.853
Oh, thank Confucius.

28:54.483 --> 28:58.147
Hey Big. Who is a good dog?
Who's a good boy?

28:58.987 --> 29:02.526
I call that a dog, huh!
Good attitude, funny.

29:04.785 --> 29:06.993
Do you think that will work?

29:12.167 --> 29:14.659
Skanzs Warehouse Benefit Gala,

29:15.587 --> 29:17.453
A BETTER FUTURE

29:37.901 --> 29:42.111

29:42.906 --> 29:47.241

Company logo on it, huh?

29:48.412 --> 29:49.903

a screw loose, ...

29:50.247 --> 29:52.614

You say and when I tell you it ok?

29:53.208 --> 29:55.575
Olfactory 'turn. Do you have it?

29:56.461 --> 30:00.000
I think a lot of it,
is in the camp over there.

30:00.632 --> 30:03.841
You have to find that.
So here again sniff it.

30:06.513 --> 30:09.301
May I have your attention.
I'm Detective Dancer ...

30:09.558 --> 30:14.394
... From the Louisiana police station.
Everyone stays where he is.

30:15.105 --> 30:16.471
I have reason to believe ...

30:16.815 --> 30:21.810
... That a lot here
illegal money is stored.

30:22.779 --> 30:24.395

No Princess! No, he did not.
No, I did not mean.

Just like my lawyer.

31:05.739 --> 31:09.153
Oh how sweet ... She has trained the.

31:09.409 --> 31:10.991
No, not that much money.

31:13.580 --> 31:18.041
No, not that! Hey, no,

31:18.418 --> 31:20.080
Lucy, no!

31:39.940 --> 31:47.780
Princess! - Detective Dancer ... I think
not that you are on the guest list.

31:48.740 --> 31:51.232
Oh, I'm out of here
professional reasons.

31:52.160 --> 31:58.498
But they are no longer a detective.

These people here ...

32:11.972 --> 32:15.431
... Just know your
criminal not machinations.

32:16.101 --> 32:19.185
You should go before I a
Cop right call, arrested the like.

32:19.813 --> 32:21.054
It's not over yet, Skanz.

32:21.481 --> 32:22.892
You are naive, Dancer ...

32:23.358 --> 32:25.190
A threat to
our society ...

32:25.986 --> 32:27.898
I apply for a
Contact ban, tomorrow morning.

32:28.488 --> 32:31.151
It's over! Not even Captain
Murray can save you this time.

32:36.830 --> 32:40.039
You know, I could
never suffer. I am very small

32:41.001 --> 32:44.494
Ok, I'm going already. They
The jacket must not crumple so.

32:49.468 --> 32:52.461
Here we find Mongrel.
He tried to kill me ...

32:52.762 --> 32:55.550
... But I think that's
our last chance to solve the case.

33:00.729 --> 33:02.095
Not test me
to help again.

33:02.481 --> 33:03.813
Stay 'easy here.

33:10.572 --> 33:13.030
You should take a
Psychiatrists track.

33:23.627 --> 33:24.743
Well then ...

33:26.963 --> 33:27.999
We're closed.

33:30.342 --> 33:33.585
Yes, I am looking for ... Mongrel.

33:35.096 --> 33:36.337
Does anyone know of a Mongrel here?

33:37.015 --> 33:41.976
This is my wife. Hey You,
You have about a problem with us?

33:42.354 --> 33:46.815
No, hey, calm people.
There is no reason for all this, ok?

33:48.902 --> 33:50.643
I ordered 'me just a drink, okay?

33:51.112 --> 33:56.528
Here, à la maison!
What, you want to insult me?

33:57.536 --> 33:58.993
After that's looks.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.449
Why do not you take a sip?

34:02.207 --> 34:03.197
Because he's a cop.

34:03.959 --> 34:04.995
Hold him.

34:05.544 --> 34:06.580
Is not that right, Dancer?

34:06.962 --> 34:10.922
Hey mongrel! Your villains
are always in such good shape ...

34:11.216 --> 34:12.797
Does your all in the same gym?

34:13.217 --> 34:16.302
They did not pay me,
They said I screwed it the job.

34:17.138 --> 34:20.802
But you let me try 'times ...

34:22.851 --> 34:25.686
Nothing personal.
That's the business.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.934
Now you're in trouble ...

34:32.152 --> 34:35.021
This is a highly trained fighting dog.

34:35.532 --> 34:38.696
I have to say something,
and she'll bite your head off.

34:39.286 --> 34:49.284
Is that so? ... What a pretty
little doggie ... hm, what's that?

35:45.602 --> 35:47.343
Are you kidding me?

35:49.731 --> 35:51.188
Take down the thing from me.

35:51.566 --> 35:52.522
Who made you set on me?

35:52.901 --> 35:55.484
What do you think? Your biggest fan.

35:55.904 --> 35:57.520
Because I money laundering
came on the track?

35:57.822 --> 35:58.778
The what?

35:58.990 --> 36:02.358
Mutz told me everything.
As it is ticked? Ship? Plane?

36:02.869 --> 36:08.706
Idiot! Do not ship the money.
Bring it forth ... three million.

36:09.209 --> 36:10.791
Come on Mongrel.
Three million are cash ...

36:11.044 --> 36:12.376
... Certainly not worth the effort.

36:12.671 --> 36:13.627
In cash.

36:13.963 --> 36:14.919
I beg your pardon?

36:15.256 --> 36:17.213
In one dollar bills,
they have a buyer.

36:17.634 --> 36:21.503
A liaison officer
from Chicago ... Poocharelli.

36:22.055 --> 36:23.546
Why should someone from the Mafia ...

36:23.807 --> 36:25.298
... Three million
Sell ​​one-dollar bills?

36:25.600 --> 36:28.684
Age, that's life.
And now take down the thing from me.

36:29.187 --> 36:33.227
Let him, Princess. I do not want,
that you'll get worms from him.

36:35.944 --> 36:38.778
Ok, we have a few
get good information ...

36:39.280 --> 36:41.317
... But you can such
not bring crazy actions.

36:41.574 --> 36:42.815
Do not be so emotional ...

36:43.118 --> 36:45.405
Be rather like me,
calm and collected.

36:45.745 --> 36:47.611
Ok, that was a good job.

36:47.831 --> 36:50.619
Just for the record, I had him there,
where I wanted him.

36:55.630 --> 36:56.871
I think I have to feed you, huh?

37:01.720 --> 37:03.507
Let us bring dry food,
or whatever you eat.

37:04.097 --> 37:06.339
Excuse me sir, but your pet,
must on a leash.

37:06.933 --> 37:11.177
My what? Oh, you have it
not taken after the party?

37:12.147 --> 37:13.888
You can not naked
roam. Come on '...

37:19.154 --> 37:23.398
Can you remember me decide? ...
How about that?

37:25.201 --> 37:29.571
This one?
One hundred twenty-five dollars?

37:30.582 --> 37:35.373
How much do you earn?
Approximately? We do not accept this.

37:38.006 --> 37:40.840
How about if we Your cuddly toy,
exchange them for that?

37:41.426 --> 37:43.759
Come on, Your's looks
like a used cough drop.

37:48.391 --> 37:50.257
Can you remember
Just choose ...

37:50.643 --> 37:53.260
These look really good.

37:54.731 --> 38:00.477
Red or Blue? Beef and liver?
Mmm, delicious ... that's organic?

38:11.164 --> 38:17.411
What is that? Chicken with rice ..
Oh, poached salmon and vegetables?

38:18.421 --> 38:23.667
You know I do not eat 'times as something good.
Women!

38:52.038 --> 38:53.745
You know what is a mystery?

38:55.375 --> 39:01.121
A Mystery? A Question,
on which there is no simple answer.

39:02.048 --> 39:09.216
Just as, "why, Kenny Bassett is in
Coma and Rick Dancer running around ".

39:10.098 --> 39:12.681
I wanted you to fetch the chain.

39:13.226 --> 39:16.344
Instead, I have
a teenager in a coma ...

39:17.355 --> 39:21.816
... And the annoying attention
the choleric crowd.

39:22.443 --> 39:24.901
The cops believe it was a robbery.

39:25.488 --> 39:29.027
Apparently, there's a cop,
does not believe that.

39:29.951 --> 39:31.567
Dancer?

39:32.954 --> 39:34.394
Where's my chain?

39:34.414 --> 39:35.450
The child she had not with him.

39:35.832 --> 39:43.080
Until, my chain is not back,
is compromised my position.

39:43.923 --> 39:48.088
You're not only failed,
ye have made it worse.

39:48.553 --> 39:50.636
Give me your weapon.

39:59.147 --> 40:00.763
You Dancer out to me.

40:01.274 --> 40:04.858
Ahh! You've shot me in the foot.

40:05.612 --> 40:08.275
Is our friend
Cleveland arrived?

40:09.073 --> 40:10.780
He just checked in.

40:11.117 --> 40:14.781
Well, he should feel
feel and cleans up the mess.

40:15.246 --> 40:17.659
This time is to run everything smoothly.

40:31.804 --> 40:35.138
Yes I know the cleaning lady
This year in sick.

40:39.228 --> 40:41.971
Mealtime! You Are Welcome ...

40:43.650 --> 40:45.357
Shall I make you also still warm?

40:45.568 --> 40:48.026
If you ever said,
that you're worse than a cat ?!

40:50.823 --> 40:52.359
You tried my
Sabotage wedding ...

40:52.784 --> 40:54.446
Why do not you admit it?

40:54.953 --> 40:56.945
You have separated you.
You've told me yourself ...

40:57.372 --> 40:59.159
... That you do not love him anymore.

40:59.457 --> 41:02.165
Okay, that's Dawn understood?

41:02.669 --> 41:05.787
She looks good, but it is nasty.

41:06.339 --> 41:08.126
Dawn never takes responsibility.

41:08.549 --> 41:11.166
And here, this is Josie, it is ok.
She's not the brightest.

41:11.511 --> 41:14.800
You two together? ...
- I spend the whole for a week ...

41:15.348 --> 41:17.681
... And Ed is howling back to me.

41:18.017 --> 41:19.929
Yes, I know I
hate her voice even.

41:20.228 --> 41:22.845
It's sad, you have to accept it.

41:23.815 --> 41:25.272
You just stay here.

41:44.210 --> 41:50.377
Oh, sorry ... sorry? ... What am I doing?

41:50.883 --> 41:57.426
OK OK! Consumption 'are not the
all the hot water! What's going on here?

42:01.519 --> 42:04.512
Sleep 'where you want.
But I do not share the bed with you.

42:15.033 --> 42:17.571
Think Do not turn. No No ...

42:20.204 --> 42:23.948
No! Hey, you're a very rude guest

42:24.709 --> 42:33.084
What do you do?
Ok, you think you're very clever, huh?

42:42.268 --> 42:49.436
Did I like. Ok, how's that?
Here we are, come now '!

42:50.359 --> 42:53.443
All right. All aboard
for the washing machine Express.

42:58.743 --> 43:03.204
I'm gonna make you no doors.
I'm too dirty for you?

43:04.123 --> 43:08.037
This means that you and your new, expensive necklace ...

43:08.586 --> 43:11.329
... Can sleep here, ok?
What do you think about?

43:14.258 --> 43:18.002
Good night .. go '!

43:21.307 --> 43:22.514
Hey, I thought you're so smart ...

43:22.850 --> 43:24.386
... 'Let's see how you open the door without a thumb?

43:24.727 --> 43:28.892
As I said, I'm the man,
You dog. I am the supervisor.

43:33.152 --> 43:36.236
No, no, too late! You had
Your chance to behave.

43:47.166 --> 43:51.831
What is now? You are very loud ...

44:35.381 --> 44:36.963
Ok, what is it?

44:40.845 --> 44:42.882
Shut up, I'm working.

44:54.525 --> 44:56.562
Had I merely paying attention in school.

45:10.208 --> 45:12.416
You do not only with
whom you play here ...

45:15.087 --> 45:17.374
Who is your boss?
- Princess! No!

45:28.434 --> 45:30.426
Why did not police fish?

45:31.812 --> 45:37.683
Hear finally on it. What's happening?
Everything OK?

45:39.111 --> 45:41.819
Would you like your baby? I'll get it to you.

45:50.373 --> 45:55.914
Not good at all! Here, I'm sorry.

46:11.477 --> 46:13.093
Detective Dancer, it's late.

46:13.479 --> 46:17.018
Yes I know. I'm so sorry,
but today we were at home 'evening.

46:17.316 --> 46:20.434
We ate and
we looked Housewives, ...

46:20.778 --> 46:25.443
... Everything was good. When we went to sleep,
wanted it in my bed.

46:25.866 --> 46:27.983
So I had it on a
Ceiling pull down the hall.

46:28.286 --> 46:30.027
Then I in the washroom
accidentally bleach ...

46:30.371 --> 46:32.363
... In the washing machine
done and it bleached the thing.

46:32.707 --> 46:35.450
I do not know what's going on,
but she does not stop crying.

46:38.045 --> 46:39.877
Princess to me.

46:43.259 --> 46:47.253
Hey, my baby, you're home,
OK, come on in.

46:48.347 --> 46:53.593
Hey, Princess, good girl.
Nice to have you here.

46:54.020 --> 46:55.261
Princess come, 'her.

46:55.604 --> 46:57.220
You two know each other.

47:02.987 --> 47:06.731
Because, you see? The
comical behavior. What is wrong with her?

47:07.199 --> 47:09.566
Baby, look at me,
whether Princess wants to get out.

47:09.827 --> 47:11.443
Princess to me.

47:16.459 --> 47:19.497
I believe that she is looking for my husband.

47:19.879 --> 47:22.462
Oh, it's so late. I'm so sorry.
I hope I do not disturb you.

47:22.923 --> 47:26.542
No, no not at all.
My husband died.

47:26.886 --> 47:29.094
Oh I'm sorry.

47:36.979 --> 47:38.971
Dancer is in this house.

47:39.690 --> 47:41.647
Let 'to find out who lives here.

47:51.911 --> 47:53.823
Ruby asks if Princess
today is allowed to stay here.

47:54.413 --> 47:58.908
Sure, you can keep from me.
I'll get up tomorrow morning.

47:59.752 --> 48:01.789
Good Idea.

48:02.380 --> 48:05.794
Hey, listen, then,
when I was here, when I asked you ...

48:06.133 --> 48:10.503
... If you ever had a loss
and, I did not realize ...

48:11.013 --> 48:12.595
I'm so sorry.

48:13.057 --> 48:15.720
I did not know your husband but
I've heard nothing but good from him.

48:16.060 --> 48:17.847
He was a good cop ...
- Thanks.

48:18.938 --> 48:20.349
Have you ever found out who it was?

48:22.274 --> 48:23.890
Unclear ...
- Hmm.

48:25.820 --> 48:30.611
Can I get you 'get what? ..
Water? Soda? Tea?

48:31.033 --> 48:32.399
A Tea ...
- Ok.

48:35.663 --> 48:39.247
So what about Princess?

48:39.834 --> 48:44.204
I think she is struggling with
post-traumatic stress.

48:46.882 --> 48:48.965
This is normal after a big loss.

48:49.552 --> 48:51.293
You must really miss him, huh?

48:52.430 --> 48:54.262
Well, she was with Kyle when he died.

48:54.807 --> 48:56.890
These police dogs are trained to ...

48:57.226 --> 48:59.718
that they sacrifice themselves for
their two-legged partner.

49:00.312 --> 49:04.101
I truly believe that they
themselves are to blame for it.

49:05.192 --> 49:07.058
Why can not they live here?
They seem to be happy here.

49:07.445 --> 49:11.485
Yes, and we love them. She is so cute.
It's just, it is not a pet.

49:11.740 --> 49:15.279
She has been a Police Officer.
She needs a job, to be happy.

49:15.703 --> 49:17.740
And you know, I think
she is tonight freaky, ...

49:18.038 --> 49:21.281
... Because when washing her baby,
Kyle's have washed smell.

49:21.709 --> 49:24.326
That was the last link to him.

49:28.215 --> 49:29.672
Seems as though I have much in common and the dog.

49:29.884 --> 49:30.874
We're both crazy.

49:31.218 --> 49:32.880
I do not know, at least when it comes to the dog.

49:33.179 --> 49:34.295
Hey.

49:35.764 --> 49:39.678
Oh. Excuse me, that's my
Emergency telephone number. Hello There?

49:41.687 --> 49:45.897
Yes, Mrs. Corso ok.
We do now again the breathing exercise.

49:46.275 --> 49:48.892
Four times, and four times from.

49:55.951 --> 49:57.988
Can I get a glass of water?

49:59.997 --> 50:06.415
Your mother is on the phone.
I do not know where their water have.

50:07.338 --> 50:08.954
It is in the sink.

50:10.591 --> 50:11.672
Right.

50:17.097 --> 50:18.588
Thanks.

50:19.350 --> 50:22.184
So good night, all right?

50:22.895 --> 50:24.682
Will you tell me a story?

50:25.314 --> 50:28.648
I'm a cop.
I should chase criminals ...

50:29.777 --> 50:32.440
Honestly,
I mean, I do not know ...

50:33.072 --> 50:36.941
Well ... 'let's see.

50:37.701 --> 50:40.739
Long ago, led the
Great Wolf only evil design ...

50:41.080 --> 50:42.662
He was addicted to gambling and drinking alcohol ...

50:43.040 --> 50:44.997
... And that's why he could
not pay his mortgage.

50:45.584 --> 50:47.416
So he set off with the seven dwarfs.

50:47.795 --> 50:49.627
One of them gave him a tip,
that Cinderella ...

50:49.964 --> 50:53.048
... A new pair of glass slippers,
which were very expensive.

50:53.425 --> 50:56.634
I think it was Seppel ...
- I do not think that was so.

50:57.012 --> 51:02.974
Who told here, me or you?
But the shoes were stolen.

51:03.394 --> 51:06.137
But Cinderella knew it was the
bad wolf and she was lucky.

51:06.480 --> 51:09.188
She had a policeman as a friend,
Detective Charming.

51:09.608 --> 51:11.440
Well, he's not the typical Prince Charming.

51:11.735 --> 51:13.226
He gave himself a
little hang, ...

51:13.571 --> 51:14.652
... But he still looks good.

51:15.030 --> 51:16.862
He wears only no cape and tights ok?

51:17.408 --> 51:20.526
He followed the great wolf to
the house and looked through his ...

51:20.869 --> 51:23.111
... Special camera and he saw,
that the shoes were on the table.

51:23.622 --> 51:27.411
He grabbed a megaphone
and shouted, "Bring out the shoes, ...

51:27.835 --> 51:29.497
... Or I arrest you. "

51:29.962 --> 51:33.455
And the great Wolf said:
"First you have to catch me, cop."

51:34.049 --> 51:37.008
Gets Detective Charming
the shoes the princess?

51:37.511 --> 51:39.878
Waiting still.
So Detective Charming knew ...

51:40.222 --> 51:42.259
... He has to go in there,
but he not only did it.

51:42.600 --> 51:45.468
He got support.
Go 'never pure unaided.

51:45.853 --> 51:46.809
The SEK team cruised.

51:47.187 --> 51:48.849
They surrounded the house of the wicked wolf.

51:49.148 --> 51:51.435
They pumped three cans of tear gas into the house.

51:51.775 --> 51:54.734
The Wolf stifled. He came out and
fell on the grass, she slapped him ...

51:55.154 --> 51:57.441
He now sits 3 - 5 years in state prison.

51:57.740 --> 51:59.606
Detective Charming brought the shoes back to ...

51:59.950 --> 52:01.191
... Cinderella and she was overjoyed.

52:01.577 --> 52:05.491
They went to eat something and to the movies.
End, good night.

52:07.541 --> 52:10.909
Ok, ok, good night Mrs. Corso.

52:12.046 --> 52:14.038
Excuse me, some of my former clients ...

52:14.340 --> 52:16.002
... Are a little difficult.

52:16.216 --> 52:19.800
Listen, this Regulation
you have taken ...

52:20.387 --> 52:22.174
... To help me or the dog?

52:22.973 --> 52:26.967
You should ... well, you're Princess's last chance.

52:27.311 --> 52:30.179
She has bitten people, she is moody ...

52:30.856 --> 52:32.848
... And they should be put to sleep.

52:33.609 --> 52:34.725
I know how she feels.

52:35.110 --> 52:37.568
Moment, you know, we must
make even the assessment completed.

52:37.946 --> 52:41.986
You know Doc, in your
To sit Office makes me sick.

52:42.618 --> 52:46.783
Then I do what I can.
You should feel less sick.

52:47.456 --> 52:48.572
OK thank you.

52:49.500 --> 52:50.786
Good Night.

53:03.597 --> 53:05.839
Thank you for coming earlier.

53:06.850 --> 53:08.248
I come into trouble,
if I help you?

53:08.268 --> 53:09.384
Yes.

53:12.398 --> 53:15.482
Is it true you have a six
Types finished with five shots?

53:16.276 --> 53:18.484
Do not believe everything
what you hear, kiddo.

53:20.364 --> 53:22.947
You see, that's what came with me.
What is that?

53:24.451 --> 53:26.113
Hey, you have a bit of
Your friend at the FBI heard?

53:26.328 --> 53:27.694
He says Poochareli is in town.

53:28.038 --> 53:32.157
You have listened to his phone, he meets up with
someone's lunch. I have the address here.

53:32.710 --> 53:36.203
That's federal business.
You have no authority.

53:36.547 --> 53:38.083
It is encrypted.
You need a key.

53:38.507 --> 53:39.543
A Key?

53:39.925 --> 53:42.793
A companion piece of software,
that matches this.

53:43.804 --> 53:45.045
Fetch the Bassett Act.
I need the number ...

53:45.222 --> 53:47.088
... Kenny's girlfriend, Shawna.

53:47.391 --> 53:51.635
I've never been here.
Hey kid, there were four shots.

53:55.399 --> 53:56.890
Hey. Excuse the new look, ...

53:57.234 --> 54:00.193
... But Ruby thought,
it's time for a little change.

54:00.821 --> 54:03.609
You look very unprofessional.

54:04.032 --> 54:05.489
So I thought,
after all the drama last night ...

54:05.826 --> 54:08.159
... We could maybe your
Assessment in the city to carry out?

54:08.537 --> 54:10.620
How about eating lunch with?

54:11.373 --> 54:14.241
Ok. I'll just quickly get Ruby
and you write me where I meet you.

54:14.585 --> 54:16.702
Perfect. Come on '.

54:27.973 --> 54:30.761
So that's what we know so far:
Poochareli is here eating lunch ...

54:31.185 --> 54:33.723
... And buy exactly $ 3,000,001 bills.

54:34.188 --> 54:36.054
Skanz was beating Kenny and the
Hospital bring ...

54:36.356 --> 54:37.597
... Because of a software.

54:37.858 --> 54:40.771
Since there is a correlation and
if we continue to go about it ...

54:41.069 --> 54:43.311
... We will probably
thereby killed.

54:43.739 --> 54:46.982
Are you in? Me too.

54:47.534 --> 54:49.526
Do not forget it. It was your decision.

54:56.543 --> 55:01.334
Hey Princess, which was a good choice.
That's one of my favorite places.

55:02.007 --> 55:04.920
Sir, dogs are only
the outdoor terrace allowed.

55:05.511 --> 55:07.252
There are no exceptions.

55:08.472 --> 55:11.556
I'll handle that. You know,
Whoever sits in front of you?

55:11.767 --> 55:13.724
This is the greatest
Dogs star on the planet.

55:14.102 --> 55:16.594
We turn here with her
new movie: "Rin Tin Tin".

55:17.189 --> 55:19.977
Anyway sir, dogs
are in here not allowed.

55:20.776 --> 55:23.018
I I explain it to you like this:
Do you know what happens ...

55:23.362 --> 55:26.230
... When a film crew is in town?
Economic revival.

55:26.615 --> 55:28.151
I would not like to have to tell your boss ...

55:28.450 --> 55:29.907
... Because of you that we
will cancel the rotation.

55:30.160 --> 55:32.117
Even better, we 'bout
when I call the newspaper ...

55:32.496 --> 55:34.738
... And then you would expect from
now shaded with a camera.

55:37.251 --> 55:39.208
I think we can
make an exception, Sir.

55:39.545 --> 55:41.628
This is a good decision dear.

55:41.922 --> 55:45.586
I want to sit outside, ok?
We go there along.

55:46.260 --> 55:50.174
Oh, you know, the
Terrace is also ok.

55:50.472 --> 55:51.929
Follow me.

55:52.266 --> 55:54.599
They have so many problems.

55:54.935 --> 55:56.892
I'm in a theater group,
just let us eat.

55:57.229 --> 55:59.812
Only through you, I will
Can Ruby's college fund.

56:16.957 --> 56:19.449
Sir, your dog may not sit at the table.

56:19.877 --> 56:21.789
Ok. Hey, 'down, na Come on.

56:22.254 --> 56:27.090
Welcome to our restaurant.

56:27.843 --> 56:31.928
I am now your culinary
Taste explosion in charge ...

56:32.556 --> 56:35.390
Have you previously
before our guest?

56:35.851 --> 56:37.683
What do you think?

56:38.604 --> 56:44.145
Our daily offering is the quinoa,
Soy Steak Medley ...

56:46.028 --> 56:54.403
... With glazed raspberries.
Sir, your dog!

56:56.538 --> 56:59.030
Mr. Poochareli I did not think ...

56:59.374 --> 57:01.457
... That this is a here
Restaurant of your choice is.

57:01.919 --> 57:04.582
Yeah, well, I have to restrain myself.

57:05.339 --> 57:08.423
The FBI is after me,
and ticks behind dead dogs.

57:08.842 --> 57:10.549
Irritating, but I can understand ...

57:10.886 --> 57:13.219
... For my part I
a similar problem.

57:14.890 --> 57:16.973
Sir, your dog!

57:18.685 --> 57:19.641
Princess!

57:19.978 --> 57:22.971
Ehm, where was I? Oh yes.

57:25.150 --> 57:29.019
Yes, that does not work.
Sir, are you all right?

57:29.196 --> 57:31.358
Why the unexpected visit?

57:31.698 --> 57:37.285
There was a change of plan.
The deal will take place today evening.

57:39.414 --> 57:41.827
That's impossible.
The money is not finished.

57:42.292 --> 57:45.751
The whole thing boils already.
I get the money tonight.

57:46.088 --> 57:47.044
Or what?

57:47.464 --> 57:48.625
Or no deal.

57:49.758 --> 57:54.002
Do something with this man.
I have a sinking feeling in my stomach.

57:55.597 --> 57:57.509
You expect me to eat this poison.

57:57.766 --> 57:59.723
Look at what it with the
Idiot did over there.

58:00.143 --> 58:02.681
Need anything?
A glass of water perhaps?

58:05.357 --> 58:07.724
Give us a minute?
Just a minute?

58:10.362 --> 58:14.777
Is it perhaps,
allergic to good food?

58:20.539 --> 58:22.326
Let us order.

58:34.428 --> 58:36.169
I finish the reluctant,
but we have to leave.

58:36.388 --> 58:38.550
Come on 'Princess, from the car.

58:42.519 --> 58:44.385
Princess, Come on '.

58:44.855 --> 58:46.437
You listen to a show of hands.

58:47.274 --> 58:51.518
That's seat. That's Place ...

58:53.655 --> 58:55.942
... And that you do,
if it is to find what.

58:56.408 --> 58:59.697
Is there an instruction manual
or so that I could learn?

59:00.787 --> 59:02.870
Ruby Baby, go into the car, ok.

59:04.875 --> 59:06.662
I just had a
Conversation with Captain Murray ...

59:07.044 --> 59:08.910
... And he asks for your progress.

59:09.171 --> 59:10.127
Well, in this regard

59:10.422 --> 59:13.130
What exactly am I supposed to tell him?
That was Skanz there.

59:14.051 --> 59:15.792
You're right. I'm so sorry.
I ... I did not want ...

59:16.053 --> 59:19.637
Transfer me and
my daughter ever again in danger.

59:20.557 --> 59:23.470
You must take responsibility
to take responsibility for your actions, Detective.

59:29.816 --> 59:31.899
What are you looking at? Here we go.

59:49.169 --> 59:52.037
Hey Shawna, thank you for coming.
How's Kenny?

59:52.589 --> 59:56.503
He's out of the coma,
but still in intensive care.

59:57.052 --> 59:59.465
I'll find the guys,
who did this.

59:59.930 --> 01:00:01.922
Why do you want the chain?

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:05.884
Well, I believe that this
Search dangerous types afterwards.

01:00:06.269 --> 01:00:07.305
I do not understand.

01:00:07.729 --> 01:00:10.221
I think it's safer for you,
if I only 'times keep that, ok?

01:00:10.565 --> 01:00:11.555
Good Luck.

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:13.899
Take care of yourself, thank you!

01:00:16.488 --> 01:00:20.402
Who is a good detective?
Who is a good detective?

01:00:24.204 --> 01:00:29.996
Ok, look out, the great thing about
a Icee is simplicity.

01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:34.792
There is ice and cherry juice.
Ok, Come on ', I'll show it to you.

01:00:39.719 --> 01:00:40.926
You'll probably not like ...

01:00:41.221 --> 01:00:42.757
It does not consist of
distilled water ...

01:00:43.056 --> 01:00:44.672
... And the cherries
have not been previously polished.

01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:50.474
Hey, you want to try? Hm?

01:00:51.106 --> 01:00:54.770
Ok, here, only a small sip.
That's enough then but.

01:00:56.611 --> 01:01:01.572
A bit - Hey, ahh, damn,
You ruined a perfect Icee.

01:01:07.122 --> 01:01:08.158
Get down!

01:01:11.668 --> 01:01:13.034
Ah, Princess!

01:01:42.824 --> 01:01:44.736
Oh, that looks bad, huh?

01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:46.529
Just wait, until the boys learn from the cell block, ...

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:49.283
... That Officer
Princess you have done.

01:01:49.748 --> 01:01:52.115
I'd call her back so,
but they had no lunch.

01:02:00.884 --> 01:02:02.125
Sit down, Dancer.

01:02:02.469 --> 01:02:03.550
Hey, before you start, you can ...

01:02:03.887 --> 01:02:05.844
Snout Dancer!

01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:10.471
That's special investigator Shepard, FBI.

01:02:11.019 --> 01:02:12.976
What does the FBI in the city?

01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:16.267
Do you know him?

01:02:16.858 --> 01:02:18.190
Never seen.

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:22.061
Are you sure?

01:02:23.615 --> 01:02:26.403
We believe that a family wanted,
that they eliminate Pocchareli.

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:27.946
A boy named Billy Mutz ...

01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:32.284
Billy Mutz is in the emergency room
and hopes to feel his toe again.

01:02:32.666 --> 01:02:36.330
The Comstock cooperation,
Owner of SAVE-A-BUCK ...

01:02:36.711 --> 01:02:37.952
... Sue for damages.

01:02:38.171 --> 01:02:40.788
I have a list of celebrities
the oath swear ...

01:02:41.132 --> 01:02:42.668
... That you have Eric Skanz's party ruined.

01:02:43.051 --> 01:02:44.792
Eric Skanz located
just in this building ...

01:02:45.011 --> 01:02:46.968
... And requested a contact ban.

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:49.301
I wanted anyone,
step on their feet.

01:02:49.641 --> 01:02:50.631
Poochareli I do not care.

01:02:50.934 --> 01:02:51.970
Oh, you are I do not care.

01:02:52.852 --> 01:02:54.263
I have four years and seven thousand hours ...

01:02:54.562 --> 01:02:56.474
... Plugged into the Poochareli history.

01:02:56.856 --> 01:02:59.064
How many of these hours
They needed to find out ...

01:02:59.317 --> 01:03:00.558
... That an overweight
Cop and a dog ...

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:02.689
... With curlers in her hair,
no elite team are.

01:03:03.113 --> 01:03:04.854
Oh, you have the guy
take here on a leash.

01:03:05.282 --> 01:03:07.239
So if Poochareli and
Skanz in the same boat ...

01:03:07.534 --> 01:03:09.947
... I was probably right.
I knew about the money laundering.

01:03:10.328 --> 01:03:12.490
Yet another reason for
You stay out of yourself.

01:03:12.831 --> 01:03:13.895
They're in my territory.

01:03:13.915 --> 01:03:17.659
They do not obey.
Officer, would you be so kind ..

01:03:20.672 --> 01:03:22.504
Give me your weapon and your brand.

01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:25.420
Come on Tony.
You will not let you be pushed around by the.

01:03:25.844 --> 01:03:29.463
You're first on leave until the office
a full investigation concludes.

01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:37.762
What's with Princess ... the dog?

01:03:38.398 --> 01:03:39.479
You will remain here.

01:03:39.691 --> 01:03:40.807
Tony, they are put to sleep.

01:03:41.151 --> 01:03:42.312
You have more to lose.

01:03:42.694 --> 01:03:45.983
I'd like to stay and your
little love quarrel experience, but ...

01:03:46.573 --> 01:03:48.815
... I still have work to do right.

01:03:57.042 --> 01:03:59.955
Are you leave of his senses?

01:04:00.253 --> 01:04:01.414
I warned you, Dancer!

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:03.037
I told you,
You're out there all alone.

01:04:03.465 --> 01:04:05.377
You know, I'm right!

01:04:07.302 --> 01:04:08.292
How close is your turn?

01:04:08.553 --> 01:04:09.543
What?

01:04:10.305 --> 01:04:12.968
You're finished Dancer!
You could not 'even solve a case ...

01:04:13.308 --> 01:04:15.516
... If he would jump out into the eye.
Come here.

01:04:17.312 --> 01:04:19.053
They flog money. I am sure.

01:04:19.397 --> 01:04:21.354
I just do not know exactly when.
I'm very close.

01:04:21.816 --> 01:04:25.059
OH, always these excuses from you!
All the time just excuses!

01:04:25.487 --> 01:04:28.901
You have one more chance,
it profitable to earn support.

01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:32.484
Make something of it!

01:04:33.244 --> 01:04:34.735
So we work together?

01:04:35.413 --> 01:04:36.574
Was that a joke?

01:04:36.748 --> 01:04:39.161
Hau 'from ... hau' ab!

01:04:43.338 --> 01:04:45.045
I must be crazy.

01:04:48.802 --> 01:04:53.922
What's wrong honey?
What's happening? What's happening?

01:05:01.231 --> 01:05:03.848
Princess, what's wrong?

01:05:04.317 --> 01:05:06.900
Princess, what is it?

01:05:07.654 --> 01:05:10.772
Princess, what's wrong?

01:05:14.077 --> 01:05:15.443
Princess ?!

01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:22.658
Driving 'go!

01:05:22.919 --> 01:05:25.332
Princess ... Princess !!!

01:05:34.639 --> 01:05:36.301
What's with that dog?

01:05:45.483 --> 01:05:48.726
Faster!
Crazy mutt!

01:05:59.372 --> 01:06:01.955
He is still there, faster!

01:06:03.793 --> 01:06:05.534
Hang 'the dog from!

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:16.136
He's gone.

01:06:18.933 --> 01:06:20.424
For warehouse.

01:06:24.689 --> 01:06:26.646
She is such a wicked little liar ...

01:06:26.941 --> 01:06:30.150
She says and does everything
to get what she wants.

01:06:31.279 --> 01:06:34.772
Ok, what you have for me?

01:06:41.164 --> 01:06:43.781
DECRYPTION DETECTED

01:06:49.464 --> 01:06:51.171
What is that?

01:06:53.885 --> 01:06:58.926
Three million as small change.
In one-dollar bills.

01:07:00.099 --> 01:07:04.434
Mongrel told something of
Money laundering in any warehouse.

01:07:08.066 --> 01:07:09.898
Think after, thinking 'after.

01:07:10.318 --> 01:07:12.480
She thinks the whole
World belongs to her alone.

01:07:12.904 --> 01:07:14.520
What did I miss?

01:07:22.455 --> 01:07:25.198
Come on now.
Think, Think!

01:07:31.339 --> 01:07:34.923
All hope that we will fail.
But that will not happen ...

01:07:35.468 --> 01:07:37.334
... Waits and stay tuned.

01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:17.582
I got you.

01:08:23.975 --> 01:08:26.261
Audrey, listen to.
I've cracked the case.

01:08:26.603 --> 01:08:28.185
Dancer, Captain Murray said,
You must not.

01:08:28.354 --> 01:08:32.189
Yes yes I know. So Skanz prints
and selling counterfeit banknotes ...

01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:33.895
... And I'm pretty sure,
I know where.

01:08:34.234 --> 01:08:37.774
I have to come in to the kennel
so I can get my partner.

01:08:38.113 --> 01:08:39.571
Not yet Do you know it?
Princess ran away.

01:08:39.866 --> 01:08:40.822
What? Where is she?

01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:43.609
She is still missing.
You you are looking for now.

01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:45.906
I find them.

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:50.703
Have you lost who?

01:08:51.002 --> 01:08:52.412
I did, I thought it would be ...

01:08:52.712 --> 01:08:55.580
I'll make it short. Ruby is sleeping in the car.
Princess has appeared at us.

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:58.957
In the area, they said,
she was behind Eric Skanz.

01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:01.377
All You are in this city,
You have to thank me.

01:09:01.679 --> 01:09:03.090
It takes all your
bad habits to.

01:09:03.514 --> 01:09:05.301
If you were not such a
Control freak, you knew ...

01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:07.057
... How to hold on to a man.

01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:08.676
What bad habits?

01:09:10.438 --> 01:09:11.645
Now I know.

01:09:12.357 --> 01:09:13.893
Hey, I know what makes Skanz.

01:09:14.233 --> 01:09:16.770
He prints fake money with
a program of Kenny Bassett.

01:09:17.111 --> 01:09:18.522
As Kenny out found
what they needed it, ...

01:09:18.821 --> 01:09:20.653
... He stole it,
to get away as a bargaining chip.

01:09:20.907 --> 01:09:22.863
That's why they have emerged
and have beat him.

01:09:23.576 --> 01:09:25.283
What are you going to do?
- To show that I'm not crazy.

01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:26.576
Hey, Detective ...

01:09:26.828 --> 01:09:28.569
No, no, I have to
even pick up a few things.

01:09:28.872 --> 01:09:30.990
Rick, Rick, I have to talk to you.
- Not a good time.

01:09:32.210 --> 01:09:35.828
Everyone thinks they know Ed,
but no one knows him as well as I.

01:09:42.929 --> 01:09:45.421
Ok Small, Have again here?

01:09:46.057 --> 01:09:48.174
We grab us the villain.

01:09:48.975 --> 01:09:50.511
What do you think?
This is our chance.

01:09:50.895 --> 01:09:53.011
Ruby? ...
Ruby ??

01:09:53.898 --> 01:09:55.264
Ruby !!?

01:09:58.152 --> 01:09:59.268
Ruby's gone! ...
- Ok.

01:09:59.529 --> 01:10:03.569
Maybe she woke up
and running around. Ruby ...?

01:10:04.534 --> 01:10:06.526
Yes ...
- Hello Detective Dancer.

01:10:06.828 --> 01:10:08.490
Nicole!
- Ruby? -Nicole.

01:10:11.624 --> 01:10:15.834
If you and your girlfriend the child
want to see again, you are allowed to do anything.

01:10:16.504 --> 01:10:19.713
Spend a leisurely
Evening together on the couch ...

01:10:20.007 --> 01:10:22.624
... And tomorrow's all over.

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:26.007
Have the child done to you?

01:10:28.391 --> 01:10:30.178
Wait wait. Where you go?
- I'll get Ruby.

01:10:30.476 --> 01:10:31.512
No, he said we
to go into the house.

01:10:31.769 --> 01:10:33.180
He told us to stay there
Ruby and nothing happens.

01:10:33.563 --> 01:10:34.519
Nicole.

01:10:35.064 --> 01:10:37.431
I have lost my husband,
Please not my daughter.

01:10:37.734 --> 01:10:41.227
Once the deal is done,
Skanz will not need them anymore.

01:10:41.487 --> 01:10:46.152
It is then a witness. I would like to,
that you concentrate on Ruby.

01:10:47.493 --> 01:10:48.984
Rick Skanz killed Kyle.

01:10:49.412 --> 01:10:50.653
I know.

01:10:50.913 --> 01:10:53.075
To prove it, You got Princess.

01:10:53.708 --> 01:10:58.248
I know when I'm in a
Hour'm not back, Murray call.

01:10:58.546 --> 01:11:01.710
He should get there. Tell him,
I use my chance.

01:11:02.133 --> 01:11:03.249
Princess to me.

01:11:09.182 --> 01:11:10.423
Rick.

01:11:12.393 --> 01:11:13.474
I know.

01:11:23.196 --> 01:11:25.688
Never thought again
seen look like 300 million.

01:11:26.282 --> 01:11:28.899
Have not.
There are only three million.

01:11:29.327 --> 01:11:32.786
I know, but it would be 300 million,
it would look like ...

01:11:35.041 --> 01:11:35.997
It feels real.

01:11:36.375 --> 01:11:38.958
That's because it
is really real, you idiot.

01:11:39.212 --> 01:11:41.374
There are no
real hundred dollar bills.

01:11:42.465 --> 01:11:43.501
No real hundred dollar bills.

01:11:43.758 --> 01:11:45.169
What? ...
- Nothing.

01:12:13.746 --> 01:12:15.703
Come on. Time is running out.

01:12:26.843 --> 01:12:28.584
I was sure,
that it will be here.

01:12:29.929 --> 01:12:31.841
Murray told me to restrain myself.

01:12:32.765 --> 01:12:35.508
I should have listened. Ruby would
today at home with her mother.

01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:48.692
Ok, damn ', I know,
I have long not talked to you, ...

01:12:49.782 --> 01:12:52.320
... So, I'll unpack now.

01:12:53.703 --> 01:12:57.287
To satisfy my needs,
I have repelled all ...

01:12:57.665 --> 01:13:02.501
... And destroyed what I in
my life I loved.

01:13:04.964 --> 01:13:10.255
I ask not for myself, but when
You help me to find the girl ...

01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:16.590
and to bring them home,
I'll begin to live again.

01:13:18.019 --> 01:13:19.885
I promise it.

01:13:33.117 --> 01:13:34.653
Did you see that?

01:13:37.288 --> 01:13:39.951
They monitor the front entrance,
We go to the back door.

01:13:48.591 --> 01:13:51.925
Ok, Come on ', come,
ok, and be quiet, Come on.

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:54.302
It's like "trick or treating".

01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:55.670
What?

01:13:56.974 --> 01:14:00.433
Trick or treating.
Carrying three million ...

01:14:00.853 --> 01:14:02.936
... A three-hundred-million-dollar Halloween costume.

01:14:13.407 --> 01:14:17.026
Ok, hey, listen to.
Today, we do not play Supercops, ok?

01:14:17.536 --> 01:14:21.200
I want that Su Skanz forgets
and Ruby find, understand?

01:14:21.666 --> 01:14:28.254
Here, you have it? Do you have it?
Ok, find Ruby.

01:14:34.637 --> 01:14:36.219
How long does it take,
until the bleach smell evaporates?

01:14:36.597 --> 01:14:37.929
That's me so no matter.

01:14:38.224 --> 01:14:42.935
Louis, you should be with the girls.

01:14:43.521 --> 01:14:47.014
I wanted to see the money, Mr Skanz.

01:14:49.735 --> 01:14:51.067
OK OK ...

01:14:53.906 --> 01:14:56.444
When this is all over,
can I shoot him?

01:14:56.701 --> 01:14:58.488
In any case.

01:15:17.054 --> 01:15:19.137
My lunch break is in
two minutes. Take off you.

01:15:19.473 --> 01:15:21.886
I'm going to race tomorrow.
I closed 'degree from bet.

01:15:24.145 --> 01:15:25.477

01:15:25.688 --> 01:15:27.600
Paper defeated Stone won.

01:15:27.982 --> 01:15:29.974
I have never understood,
such as paper, stone defeated.

01:15:30.401 --> 01:15:33.394
You know what I a piece of paper
could do with a stone.

01:15:33.946 --> 01:15:35.687
Come on, three attempts.

01:15:44.498 --> 01:15:46.660

01:15:58.304 --> 01:16:08.303
Braves pooch, doggie braves,
Braves dog.

01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:17.737

01:16:18.282 --> 01:16:20.239
Hey!

Can take you home.

Hear, hear!

01:16:55.361 --> 01:17:00.513
Skanz, Ruby! I

01:17:00.533 --> 01:17:02.525

Write them down.

01:17:08.332 --> 01:17:12.372
Poochareli is here!

01:17:22.513 --> 01:17:24.175
This way.

01:17:24.849 --> 01:17:28.809
Change of plans. You have to
make very small, and be quiet.

01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:30.806
Is the big, bad wolf here?

01:17:31.272 --> 01:17:34.265
Yes he is, but also
Detective Charming.

01:17:34.608 --> 01:17:36.349
Did you call support?

01:17:36.902 --> 01:17:41.146
Be quiet, be quiet.
Psst, as a church mouse.

01:17:50.249 --> 01:17:51.490
Louis !?

01:18:18.611 --> 01:18:20.728

Wow, wow, wow, wow. What is that?

01:18:44.428 --> 01:18:46.010
I'll do it.

01:18:48.307 --> 01:18:50.845
It's a trap. Come on,
Take the money! Come on.

01:18:51.352 --> 01:18:53.639
You can go. The money stays here.

01:18:54.313 --> 01:18:56.680
You're crazy. You're crazy.

01:18:57.691 --> 01:19:01.355
Warmer, warmer, cold.
Ah, colder.

01:19:13.082 --> 01:19:22.879
Warmers, cold, warmer,
warmer, hot, cold, brrr cold.

01:19:37.273 --> 01:19:38.639
Two villains and no ball.

01:19:38.983 --> 01:19:41.475
This is the Russel never believe.

01:19:42.653 --> 01:19:45.191
Ok, we finish it.

01:19:46.198 --> 01:19:51.284
FBI, get out of here, come on!

01:19:52.121 --> 01:19:53.282
Both of you at the exit ...

01:19:54.748 --> 01:20:00.460
Jackpot! Hey, I'll do it, okay?
You and your people are just in the way.

01:20:00.879 --> 01:20:02.962
Forget it, a
my men in there ...

01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:05.332
I'd continue to talk,
but I have real work to do.

01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:06.757
Backs up the field!

01:20:07.011 --> 01:20:08.218
Do not let anyone get away!

01:20:15.978 --> 01:20:17.765
Stopping Skanz!
No Escape!

01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:20.222
Let fall the pockets
and put 'the gun on the ground.

01:20:23.610 --> 01:20:28.981
Turn around.
Good, now go.

01:20:29.658 --> 01:20:30.819
At last I have you Skanz.

01:20:31.118 --> 01:20:33.952
We go to the front door.
The cops and the FBI have been waiting for.

01:20:34.788 --> 01:20:38.122
All are there to a
bad cop fail to see.

01:20:39.418 --> 01:20:40.579
You're stuck with the Mafia under a hat ...

01:20:41.462 --> 01:20:42.703
... And trying to slander me.

01:20:44.131 --> 01:20:45.622
Who do you mean, they believe Dancer?

01:20:46.467 --> 01:20:49.835
The most beneficent, man of the city, ...

01:20:50.888 --> 01:20:52.174
... Or a crazy cop?

01:20:53.057 --> 01:20:54.764
It depends,
who tells the story.

01:20:57.603 --> 01:20:59.890
Captain Murry, you have Ruby?

01:21:00.064 --> 01:21:01.430
It is too dangerous.
Go back into the car.

01:21:01.732 --> 01:21:03.098
No, no way ...
- Take them out of here.

01:21:03.275 --> 01:21:04.231
Take your hands off me.

01:21:04.443 --> 01:21:05.775
No, I will not leave here!

01:21:06.904 --> 01:21:08.566
Go back to the car.

01:21:09.907 --> 01:21:11.193
Mami.

01:21:12.451 --> 01:21:14.283
Ruby? Ruby where are you?

01:21:15.537 --> 01:21:16.823
Ruby no!

01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:22.826
All you should do,
was staying at home.

01:21:23.629 --> 01:21:24.995
See, what you have done?

01:21:26.423 --> 01:21:27.379
Drop weapon!

01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:38.134
OK OK. Now let them go.

01:21:38.894 --> 01:21:40.430
I will not do that.

01:21:40.938 --> 01:21:44.807
No reason to the girl
injured. Tell me what you want.

01:21:45.234 --> 01:21:48.978
I wanted my $ 30 million.

01:21:50.406 --> 01:21:55.902
But I have to make sure
that you do not disturb again.

01:21:58.580 --> 01:21:59.536
Princess!

01:22:08.882 --> 01:22:10.965
Ruby !?
- Come on.

01:22:11.802 --> 01:22:13.964
No Movement,
Hands behind your head.

01:22:14.304 --> 01:22:15.715
Mami.

01:22:16.557 --> 01:22:17.798
Do you know who I am?

01:22:17.975 --> 01:22:20.058
You are not calm and more!

01:22:22.354 --> 01:22:26.314
Gets Help, you hear cries for help.
One officer was hit.

01:22:26.817 --> 01:22:29.981
Everything will be fine Small,
Hold on, you're going back.

01:22:30.404 --> 01:22:31.736
Gets an ambulance!

Immediately need an ambulance.

All good little one, you'll

01:23:03.687 --> 01:23:05.394
How's her doctor?

01:23:05.898 --> 01:23:09.016
She has lost a lot of blood,
I have done all I could.

01:23:09.610 --> 01:23:12.353
Now it's up to her,
how much they want to return to us.

01:23:12.905 --> 01:23:14.521
Can I go in?
- Naturally.

01:23:14.907 --> 01:23:16.569
Many Thanks!
- With Pleasure.

01:23:26.418 --> 01:23:33.837
Hey Little, I came,
to tell you how good you were.

01:23:35.719 --> 01:23:37.255
I want you to know something.

01:23:39.431 --> 01:23:43.300
Because of you is Ruby at home,
with her mother.

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:55.019
For your sake, Skanz is in prison
and because of you, I'm still here.

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:02.618
This Fürsorgekram
is but a waste of ...

01:24:03.872 --> 01:24:06.205
Hey, I told you, 'What brought.

01:24:11.088 --> 01:24:15.048
What I'll really
Come to think about Icee, ...

... You have him quickly drink,
otherwise it melts.

01:24:19.972 --> 01:24:22.840
So you have to
be fast healthy, ok?

01:24:25.018 --> 01:24:30.639
If you have nothing against it,
I'll stay a bit with you.

01:24:34.528 --> 01:24:37.362

I was asked a couple
Words to say on their behalf.

01:25:03.223 --> 01:25:06.466
Police officers who work in the K-9,
find out quickly,

01:25:06.893 --> 01:25:11.388
... Dogs become friends,
Partners and protectors.

01:25:12.107 --> 01:25:16.477
And again we get
their love and their life.

They remain faithful and honest,

01:25:22.451 --> 01:25:26.616
We owe it to them to honor this loyalty.

01:25:27.372 --> 01:25:29.409

01:26:37.401 --> 01:26:38.733
Thank you, sir.

01:26:49.246 --> 01:26:51.989
He's not your typical Prince Charming.

01:26:55.335 --> 01:26:56.667
So everything has turned positive ...

01:26:57.045 --> 01:26:58.411
... And what we learn from this?
Never give up.

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.587
If I can change,
can each.

01:27:01.007 --> 01:27:04.216
But hopefully nobody needs
go through all this trouble for it.

01:27:05.900 --> 01:30:05.900
