01:17.167 --> 01:19.099
Yep.

01:19.133 --> 01:20.600
Finally,

01:20.634 --> 01:22.500
a day off.

01:23.467 --> 01:26.034
Boy, I'm gonna
have me some fun.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.667
What?

02:02.767 --> 02:05.567
Hi, honey. Are you enjoying
your day off?

02:05.601 --> 02:07.867
Peg, you know I am.

02:07.901 --> 02:10.767
Now, how are you
gonna ruin it for me?

02:10.800 --> 02:13.900
Sex, chores, what?

02:14.434 --> 02:15.733
Oh.

02:15.767 --> 02:18.233
Well, I guess we'll
just stick to chores today.

02:18.267 --> 02:19.700
But I'll
give you a choice:

02:19.734 --> 02:22.368
shower or
fix the doorbell.

02:24.367 --> 02:27.200
How much work is it
to fix the doorbell?

02:27.234 --> 02:29.400
Well, unlike
taking a shower,

02:29.434 --> 02:31.567
you might have
to raise an arm.

02:32.567 --> 02:35.333
Oh, Al, it makes
this wheezing pathetic sound.

02:35.367 --> 02:37.600
I'm embarrassed to have
my girlfriends hear it.

02:37.634 --> 02:39.467
Oh, come on,
they've heard worse.

02:39.501 --> 02:43.101
You know, "Move along,
bossy, no grazing here."

02:45.133 --> 02:48.101
Or, "Hey, how 'bout
sharing that cud?"

02:51.934 --> 02:54.233
Excuse me.

02:54.267 --> 02:56.533
That's the doorbell, Al.

02:56.567 --> 02:58.967
Come in!

03:00.267 --> 03:01.500
Oh, hi.

03:01.534 --> 03:04.633
I'm Brenda.
I'm your new neighbor.

03:11.234 --> 03:13.934
I just moved into the house
across the street.

03:13.968 --> 03:15.366
Oh, yeah.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.166
The old Thompson house.

03:17.200 --> 03:19.233
You know, he used to be
in charge of the soy trough

03:19.267 --> 03:20.500
over at Mr. Egg Roll.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.366
But then he got promoted
to the guy who says,

03:22.400 --> 03:24.099
"What size drink with that?"

03:24.133 --> 03:26.934
So we knew he'd be moving
to a better neighborhood.

03:26.968 --> 03:28.200
Hi, I'm Peggy.
Hi.

03:28.234 --> 03:31.333
If you want anyone to tell
a secret to, just tell me.

03:31.367 --> 03:34.066
Oh, and if you need any gossip
on any of the neighbors,

03:34.100 --> 03:35.667
just ask me.

03:36.267 --> 03:38.567
People tell me everything.

03:38.601 --> 03:40.633
Yeah, well, I've already heard
about the people

03:40.667 --> 03:43.934
who live on the other side
the Bundys.

03:44.701 --> 03:47.266
Boy, the stories I've
been hearing about them.

03:47.300 --> 03:49.800
They say the husband
will steal your paper,

03:49.834 --> 03:54.134
stalk your pets
and eat your garbage.

03:56.300 --> 03:59.834
Hey, half a potato
is not garbage.

04:01.634 --> 04:04.166
Anyway, this moving in
is difficult.

04:04.200 --> 04:05.767
It's harder because...

04:05.801 --> 04:07.600
I don't have a man.

04:07.634 --> 04:09.567
Mm. I know.

04:09.601 --> 04:12.733
Where do you find one
these days?

04:12.767 --> 04:15.600
Anyway, the movers,
they left my couch out
in front of my house,

04:15.634 --> 04:17.233
and I have
a job interview.

04:17.267 --> 04:20.567
I dance on tables for men
near airports.

04:24.100 --> 04:25.966
So I was wondering if you
could watch it for me

04:26.000 --> 04:27.400
until I get back?

04:27.434 --> 04:30.066
Well, a quarter might
keep my eyes open.

04:30.100 --> 04:31.667
Heh-heh.
You know, that's funny.

04:31.701 --> 04:34.334
A quarter used to keep them
closed in high school.

04:36.133 --> 04:37.934
Well, miss,
it's my day off,

04:37.968 --> 04:39.767
and as you can see,
I'm all alone.

04:39.801 --> 04:41.300
So, uh,

04:41.334 --> 04:43.834
I don't mind moving
that couch for you.

04:43.868 --> 04:46.633
Well, it is
a big couch.

04:46.667 --> 04:49.867
But then,
you're a big man.

04:52.400 --> 04:55.099
Hi, I'm Brenda Kostrowski.

04:55.133 --> 04:59.368
Peggy, do you mind if I borrow
this big strong guy?

05:01.534 --> 05:02.733
Yeah, okay.

05:02.767 --> 05:05.333
Uh, just have him back
by tomorrow.

05:05.367 --> 05:07.633
He has to perform brain surgery
in the morning,

05:07.667 --> 05:10.867
and he has a loafer sale
in the afternoon.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.834
Eh, my mother worries so.

05:18.367 --> 05:20.133
After you, my rear.

05:20.167 --> 05:22.468
I- I mean, my dear.

05:23.501 --> 05:25.300
You are too tired
to fix the doorbell,

05:25.334 --> 05:27.400
and yet you can
go move her couch?

05:27.434 --> 05:29.101
Yeah.

05:32.734 --> 05:34.700
Let's, uh, hurry up
and get that couch inside

05:34.734 --> 05:36.934
before Peg wants
to go sit on it.

05:38.767 --> 05:41.467
Why do we have
to fix the doorbell?

05:41.501 --> 05:44.999
Well, Kelly, that's why
grownups have kids.

05:45.033 --> 05:47.333
They had me to fix things
and you to...

05:47.367 --> 05:50.500
say "What's that?"
every time you see an airplane.

05:52.033 --> 05:53.500
Now, you're sure
the power's off?

05:53.534 --> 05:55.900
For the thousandth time,

05:55.934 --> 05:58.201
yes, the power is off.

06:02.300 --> 06:04.334
Aaaaghh!

06:04.601 --> 06:07.101
Help me!

06:23.934 --> 06:25.133
Kelly,

06:25.167 --> 06:27.334
spell "off."

06:29.467 --> 06:32.034
Spell it!

06:33.701 --> 06:36.401
"O"...something.

06:40.467 --> 06:43.967
Well, I'm just gonna go
change the old underwear.

06:46.501 --> 06:48.900
And we'll start
this again.

06:49.567 --> 06:51.433
Maybe next time
you can go the extra mile

06:51.467 --> 06:53.934
and put a bucket of water
for me to stand in.

07:02.033 --> 07:03.099
Peg!

07:03.133 --> 07:04.700
Peg, come here!

07:04.734 --> 07:06.433
Guess what happened.

07:06.467 --> 07:09.334
Buck stood upright,
and he's taking over your job.

07:10.400 --> 07:12.266
Yeah, like he could work
the register.

07:12.300 --> 07:14.667
Oh, please, just tell me
what happened.

07:14.701 --> 07:17.099
Well, after I moved
Brenda's couch,

07:17.133 --> 07:18.767
she said I was cute.

07:18.801 --> 07:21.734
Oh, Peg,
I think she likes me!

07:24.267 --> 07:26.133
Oh, honey.

07:26.167 --> 07:28.667
How could she?

07:28.701 --> 07:30.333
Oh, believe me, Al,

07:30.367 --> 07:33.500
and I'm telling you this
as your wife and as your friend,

07:33.534 --> 07:35.767
no one likes you.

07:37.234 --> 07:38.400
Face it, sweetie.

07:38.434 --> 07:39.999
I know you
better than anyone.

07:40.033 --> 07:41.133
And believe me,

07:41.167 --> 07:43.767
she sees you
as the world sees you:

07:43.801 --> 07:45.767
as cheap labor.

07:45.801 --> 07:47.734
Now, how 'bout a beer?

07:48.567 --> 07:49.633
Hi, Mom.

07:49.667 --> 07:52.133
Listen, um,
Bud needs this to stand in

07:52.167 --> 07:53.967
while he fixes
the doorbell.

07:55.234 --> 07:57.633
I've gotta go tease my way
up and down the block.

07:57.667 --> 07:59.700
I just heard from the women
in the neighborhood

07:59.734 --> 08:02.134
that there's a new stud
in town.

08:03.067 --> 08:04.467
Um, Al,

08:04.501 --> 08:06.834
Kelly and I just have some
mother-daughter stuff to do.

08:06.868 --> 08:07.999
We'll be home by dark.

08:08.033 --> 08:09.200
What did you hear
about him?

08:09.234 --> 08:11.266
Well, they said
that he's big and strong

08:11.300 --> 08:12.834
and good-looking.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.633
Help me
get this ring off.

08:16.667 --> 08:18.166
Okay, what else?

08:18.200 --> 08:19.300
That's it.

08:19.334 --> 08:20.800
They were watching him
move a couch

08:20.834 --> 08:23.333
into some house
across the street.

08:23.367 --> 08:25.201
I wonder who he is.

08:33.366 --> 08:36.033
Kelly, uh,
heh-heh,

08:36.067 --> 08:39.166
that stud used
to tuck you in

08:39.200 --> 08:40.866
when you were a baby.

08:41.868 --> 08:45.034
They were looking
at the garbage man?

08:51.667 --> 08:54.066
Al, it was nothing.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.300
She was a baby.
she was crying.

08:56.334 --> 08:57.767
I was watching
the soaps.

08:57.801 --> 09:00.166
He just couldn't
stand the noise.

09:00.200 --> 09:02.133
Kelly...

09:02.167 --> 09:04.201
that stud is me.

09:07.100 --> 09:09.200
You're funny, Daddy.
No, who is he?

09:09.234 --> 09:10.266
Tell her, Peg.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.099
Tell her who
the good-lookin' stud is

09:12.133 --> 09:13.733
who has all
the neighborhood women

09:13.767 --> 09:15.900
shavin' their moustaches.

09:21.234 --> 09:22.266
It can't be.

09:22.300 --> 09:23.467
I'm going outside.

09:23.501 --> 09:26.834
There's gotta be
someone else out there.

09:28.767 --> 09:30.733
What did they say
about me?

09:30.767 --> 09:34.366
Well, they said you had
the arms of a blacksmith

09:34.400 --> 09:35.767
and the legs of a god.

09:35.801 --> 09:37.333
Did they say anything
about my butt?

09:37.367 --> 09:38.999
Oh.
Huh?

09:39.033 --> 09:41.200
I was bendin' over
an awful lot out there.

09:41.234 --> 09:43.401
Did anyone notice?
Did they? Did they?

09:44.367 --> 09:45.667
They liked it,
Daddy.

09:45.701 --> 09:48.301
Yes!

09:53.133 --> 09:55.667
And do you know why
they liked it, pumpkin?

09:55.701 --> 09:57.733
'Cause you played
high school football, Daddy?

09:57.767 --> 09:59.966
'Cause I played
high school football.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.600
It never really fades,
does it?

10:02.634 --> 10:05.767
You wanna see me
in my uniform?

10:06.067 --> 10:07.867
No.

10:07.901 --> 10:09.600
But I bet you
Bud would.

10:09.634 --> 10:10.767
I'll just
go get him.

10:10.801 --> 10:14.099
Oh, those poor Al-starved
neighborhood women.

10:14.133 --> 10:15.834
Hey, if lovin' me
is wrong,

10:15.868 --> 10:17.767
they don't wanna be right.

10:19.467 --> 10:21.467
Pumpkin,
can I ask you something?

10:21.501 --> 10:24.834
When two people are
as beautiful as we are,

10:24.868 --> 10:27.800
is it terrible to--
To flaunt what we have?

10:27.834 --> 10:29.200
Terrible?

10:29.234 --> 10:31.867
It's an obligation.

10:31.901 --> 10:33.733
A duty.

10:33.767 --> 10:36.099
I mean, it's like belonging
to whoever wins you

10:36.133 --> 10:39.034
in a knife fight.

10:41.567 --> 10:42.834
Yeah.

10:42.868 --> 10:44.433
But the important thing

10:44.467 --> 10:46.567
is to never let them
touch you.

10:46.601 --> 10:48.999
Remember, they will
never buy the cow

10:49.033 --> 10:52.667
if they can get
the eggs for free.

10:55.701 --> 10:57.533
I did.

10:57.567 --> 10:58.633
Anyway,

10:58.667 --> 11:00.233
I'm gonna do
a few push-ups

11:00.267 --> 11:02.434
and go out there
and wash the car.

11:03.234 --> 11:05.334
Of course,
I'll need a rag.

11:13.267 --> 11:14.700
Where are you goin'?

11:14.734 --> 11:17.333
Where does it look
like I'm goin'?

11:17.367 --> 11:20.167
Mr. Pudding Belly
tryouts?

11:22.734 --> 11:26.034
No, my little couch doily.

11:26.567 --> 11:28.500
I'm gonna wash the car.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.600
This can't be happening.

11:44.634 --> 11:46.266
They couldn't be
talking about him.

11:46.300 --> 11:47.800
They just couldn't.

11:47.834 --> 11:49.700
And I don't know
what he's doing out there.

11:49.734 --> 11:52.099
There is not a woman
to be found anywhere.

11:52.133 --> 11:54.667
* Do it to them
One more time *

11:54.701 --> 11:57.133
* Oh, once is never enough *

11:57.167 --> 11:59.999
* With a man like me *

12:00.033 --> 12:01.767
* Whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa *

12:01.801 --> 12:03.099
He's back!

12:03.133 --> 12:04.834
Look! He's washing his car!

12:04.868 --> 12:05.966
Oops!

12:06.000 --> 12:08.900
Looks like I got
some suds in my pants.

12:11.467 --> 12:13.834
Al, stop that!

12:13.868 --> 12:15.733
Mind your own business!

12:15.767 --> 12:17.301
Oh.

12:18.200 --> 12:20.066
I don't know what
they're lookin' at.

12:20.100 --> 12:23.633
Have they never seen flies
circle the head of a man before?

12:25.267 --> 12:27.166
No, it's attitude.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.500
I mean, for example,

12:29.534 --> 12:32.500
let's just say
that there is somebody

12:32.534 --> 12:34.733
so unattractive
in this room

12:34.767 --> 12:38.333
that even the girl cats
won't let him pet them.

12:38.367 --> 12:41.300
Now, how would
this person--

12:41.334 --> 12:44.700
Well, let's just
call him Bub.

12:44.734 --> 12:46.166
-- get attention?

12:46.200 --> 12:48.633
Now, he could go on using
his Daddy's credit card,

12:48.667 --> 12:50.500
you know,
calling date hotlines

12:50.534 --> 12:54.301
and saying that he's
Señor Pablo, U.N. diplomat,

12:56.734 --> 12:58.333
or he could learn--

12:58.367 --> 13:01.533
Before he loses his hair
to reveal his head pimples.

13:01.567 --> 13:03.800
-- that if you think
you're hot,

13:03.834 --> 13:06.034
other people will too.

13:06.567 --> 13:09.201
Señor Pablo
will not forget this.

13:12.167 --> 13:13.999
Should have seen it,
Peg.

13:14.033 --> 13:15.400
A million women
starin' at me,

13:15.434 --> 13:16.767
hooting and screaming.

13:16.801 --> 13:18.967
Now I know what
the Beatles felt like.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.600
Sweetheart, there were
three women out there:

13:22.634 --> 13:24.999
one was 60, one was 80,

13:25.033 --> 13:26.733
and one was older
than the tree they used

13:26.767 --> 13:30.034
to cut for her wooden leg.

13:31.100 --> 13:35.034
Hey, that's how
Tom Jones started, baby.

13:41.200 --> 13:42.800
Excuse me, Mr. Bundy?

13:42.834 --> 13:44.433
I was trying
to wash my car,

13:44.467 --> 13:46.800
but I'm just
a weak, little woman.

13:46.834 --> 13:48.800
Would it be asking too much
for you to come over,

13:48.834 --> 13:51.600
you know...
without your shirt,

13:51.634 --> 13:54.301
and, uh,
buff my bumpers?

13:58.868 --> 14:01.800
Hidy-hidy-hidy-ho.

14:05.400 --> 14:08.700
Now, don't go getting
your nose hairs in an uproar.

14:08.734 --> 14:10.867
You are not
goin' anywhere.

14:10.901 --> 14:12.767
Now, I don't know
where this sexy,

14:12.801 --> 14:15.366
"I'm a human being"
nonsense came from,

14:15.400 --> 14:17.800
but it's gonna stop
right now.

14:17.834 --> 14:18.966
Too late.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.533
The fuse is lit,
and the fire is on.

14:21.567 --> 14:24.034
Burn, baby, burn.

14:27.901 --> 14:30.767
It's an Al inferno.

14:38.133 --> 14:40.134
Ssss.

14:47.868 --> 14:50.400
Marcie, I tell ya,
this is serious.

14:50.434 --> 14:52.333
Something is going on.

14:52.367 --> 14:54.134
He showered.

14:55.734 --> 14:58.099
In the morning.

14:58.133 --> 15:00.300
Now, the only time
that Al used to shower

15:00.334 --> 15:02.700
was right after
we had sex.

15:02.734 --> 15:05.266
Immediately after.

15:05.300 --> 15:07.767
Sometimes even during.

15:08.334 --> 15:09.999
And you know what else?

15:10.033 --> 15:13.033
He bought a toothbrush.

15:13.067 --> 15:15.900
With a rubber tip.

15:16.601 --> 15:18.200
Oh, Peggy.

15:18.234 --> 15:19.700
I know.

15:19.734 --> 15:21.700
I don't know what to do.

15:21.734 --> 15:22.934
He's happy.

15:22.968 --> 15:25.066
He smells good.

15:25.100 --> 15:27.600
He's even making more money
at the shoe store.

15:27.634 --> 15:29.934
And last night, when I was
rifling through his pants

15:29.968 --> 15:33.433
to get some of it,
I found these:

15:33.467 --> 15:35.167
Tic Tacs.

15:39.734 --> 15:40.867
Well,

15:40.901 --> 15:42.867
according to the book
I've just read,

15:42.901 --> 15:44.900
<i>Keep Him Down,
Keep Him Down, Keep Him Down:</i>

15:44.934 --> 15:47.368
<i>A Woman's Guide
to Happiness,</i>

15:50.534 --> 15:52.467
you don't really
have to worry

15:52.501 --> 15:56.099
until a man stops buying
white underwear.

15:56.133 --> 15:57.366
The time to sweat

15:57.400 --> 15:59.567
is when men
buy underwear in a tube.

15:59.601 --> 16:01.099
You know,
the bright-colored ones

16:01.133 --> 16:03.934
that fat European men
use as bathing suits.

16:06.534 --> 16:08.467
Well, I don't have to worry
about that.

16:08.501 --> 16:12.033
Al would never give up
his white Hanes underwear.

16:12.067 --> 16:14.166
Size 34, three to a pack.

16:14.200 --> 16:16.066
I know that because
I bought him a three-pack

16:16.100 --> 16:17.266
a couple of years ago,

16:17.300 --> 16:20.600
and he still has two
he hasn't even used yet.

16:31.834 --> 16:33.033
Ladies.

16:33.067 --> 16:36.667
Excuse me,
I should say, "Lovely ladies."

16:37.167 --> 16:39.600
Hi, Al.

16:43.467 --> 16:45.301
Shut up.

16:46.234 --> 16:48.333
What are you doing home
in the middle of the day?

16:48.367 --> 16:50.400
Well, I just thought
I'd freshen up with a shower

16:50.434 --> 16:52.533
and then go back
to work.

16:52.567 --> 16:53.900
Oh, by the way,

16:53.934 --> 16:56.267
have you seen my new underwear?

17:01.000 --> 17:03.034
Zebra-striped.

17:05.934 --> 17:07.965
Uh-huh.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.367
He looks just as good going
as he does coming.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.532
Marcie.

17:15.233 --> 17:17.032
Sorry. I don't know
what came over me.

17:17.067 --> 17:19.032
Peg, you gotta come up

17:19.067 --> 17:20.934
and check me out
in my new underwear!

17:20.968 --> 17:23.165
Oh, you can bring
Marcie too!

17:23.200 --> 17:25.468
Can we, Peggy?
Can we?

17:32.133 --> 17:33.999
A large foot?
You, madam?

17:34.033 --> 17:35.266
Oh, no.

17:35.300 --> 17:38.101
You merely have
a full-figured foot.

17:38.701 --> 17:40.600
Oh, you.

17:40.634 --> 17:42.734
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

17:44.968 --> 17:47.567
Oh, please.

17:47.601 --> 17:50.700
Now, how many ballet slippers
can I fix you up with?

17:50.734 --> 17:55.134
You've been so delightful,
I'll just take them all.

17:56.167 --> 17:58.366
This is for the shoes.

17:58.400 --> 17:59.733
Thank you.

17:59.767 --> 18:01.567
And this

18:01.601 --> 18:03.867
is for the cookie monster.

18:03.901 --> 18:05.800
Oh.

18:10.067 --> 18:12.633
Well, serving number 57.

18:12.667 --> 18:14.166
Me!
Me!
Me!

18:14.200 --> 18:15.200
I'm number 57.

18:15.234 --> 18:16.333
Al! Al!

18:16.367 --> 18:17.500
Take a number.

18:17.534 --> 18:19.266
Oh, it's you.

18:19.300 --> 18:20.500
What's shakin', babe?

18:20.534 --> 18:23.400
Every chin
in this store.

18:23.434 --> 18:24.533
Look, honey.

18:24.567 --> 18:27.500
I went shopping for food.
Heh-heh-heh.

18:27.534 --> 18:29.900
And I brought you
some very special treats.

18:29.934 --> 18:32.166
Bread and cheese.

18:32.200 --> 18:36.600
Just picture them all nicely
laid out on a paper plate.

18:36.634 --> 18:38.333
Oh, come home
with me, honey.

18:38.367 --> 18:40.533
Ah, sweetheart,
you are a pearl,

18:40.567 --> 18:42.800
but as you can see, I have
to be here for a long time.

18:42.834 --> 18:45.133
I baked you a pie,

18:45.167 --> 18:47.433
Mr. Bundy.

18:47.467 --> 18:48.800
Well, thank you.

18:48.834 --> 18:50.700
Ju-- Put it over there
with the others.

18:50.734 --> 18:52.700
Okay.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.300
Anyhow, Peg, love the bread,
love the cheese,

18:56.334 --> 18:58.533
but I got my little
shoe store gig here.

18:58.567 --> 19:01.633
So, uh, why don't you go on home
and run me a nice, warm tub.

19:01.667 --> 19:04.166
And, uh, oh, by the way,
lay out my, uh,

19:04.200 --> 19:06.234
leopard underwear.

19:10.567 --> 19:12.800
Serving number 57.

19:12.834 --> 19:15.267
I'm number 57.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.200
Mom, Al's not home yet.

19:22.234 --> 19:26.067
Well, it's midnight,
and his tube is empty.

19:29.601 --> 19:31.667
Mom, could you try
not to eat corn

19:31.701 --> 19:33.633
while I'm talkin' to you.

19:33.667 --> 19:36.468
Right. I'll call you
in the morning.

19:38.200 --> 19:41.066
Gee, kids, you know,
I know I've dreamt about it,

19:41.100 --> 19:44.099
but what would I do if
your father actually does leave?

19:44.133 --> 19:46.200
Oh, don't worry, Mom.

19:46.234 --> 19:49.633
I mean, you have the skills
and education to...

19:51.701 --> 19:54.700
Well, you sit
a damn fine couch.

19:57.667 --> 19:59.600
Daddy's home!
Hey, Dad!

20:00.667 --> 20:02.099
Oh, gee, Al,

20:02.133 --> 20:03.200
where have you been?

20:03.234 --> 20:05.433
Oh, I was just...

20:05.467 --> 20:07.900
walkin' around,
and I, uh...

20:08.300 --> 20:09.999
Then I stopped.

20:10.033 --> 20:13.401
My underwear
was killin' me.

20:14.067 --> 20:15.366
Even in a mild wind,

20:15.400 --> 20:18.267
you can freeze a cheek
in these babies.

20:21.133 --> 20:22.800
Well, what happened, honey?

20:22.834 --> 20:24.767
Well, this beautiful--

20:24.801 --> 20:26.667
Very beautiful girl
came in the store...

20:26.701 --> 20:30.366
and asked me to fly away
to the Greek islands with her.

20:30.400 --> 20:33.267
Well, did you go, Daddy?

20:36.234 --> 20:37.733
Yes, pumpkin, I went.

20:37.767 --> 20:40.734
I'm sorry I didn't get
a chance to say goodbye.

20:43.334 --> 20:46.266
Anyway, all she wanted
was a love toy.

20:46.300 --> 20:48.667
Yeah, I know the feeling.

20:49.901 --> 20:51.999
Oh, please.

20:52.033 --> 20:53.999
The only feeling
that you know

20:54.033 --> 20:55.800
is Buck's fur
against your cheek

20:55.834 --> 20:57.800
on a warm summer night.

20:57.834 --> 21:00.034
Oh, now.
N- now, kids.

21:01.200 --> 21:04.033
It was every man's
fantasy:

21:04.067 --> 21:06.800
to be kept by a woman
whose skirt is as short

21:06.834 --> 21:10.468
as the life span of the man
that she chooses.

21:11.767 --> 21:13.033
But I said no.

21:13.067 --> 21:15.500
Why?

21:17.434 --> 21:19.533
Well, because I realized

21:19.567 --> 21:21.633
that everything I'd been doing
up to now,

21:21.667 --> 21:23.300
the bathing, the brushing,

21:23.334 --> 21:26.233
the changing of the socks,

21:26.267 --> 21:28.567
the being nice to people,

21:28.601 --> 21:30.700
the trying to succeed,

21:30.734 --> 21:32.366
was all for nothing.

21:32.400 --> 21:36.600
All those things
are designed to attract.

21:37.200 --> 21:39.667
Why should I be attractive?

21:39.701 --> 21:42.134
I'm married with children.

21:55.300 --> 21:58.400
Mom, look at him.

21:58.434 --> 22:00.567
What's happening?

22:05.467 --> 22:07.333
I'm scared.

22:07.367 --> 22:09.434
He's coming back.

22:10.501 --> 22:13.567
My Al is coming back!

22:24.300 --> 22:25.500
Hanes!

22:25.534 --> 22:27.401
He's back!
