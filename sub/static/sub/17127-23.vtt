00:04.035 --> 00:05.336
HEY, BOYS.

00:05.336 --> 00:08.109
HEY, DAD, CAN RICKY
 COME IN THE HOUSE?

00:08.109 --> 00:10.111
DOES HE HAVE THE MONEY
 TO PAY FOR THE VCR

00:10.111 --> 00:13.013
HE STUFFED THAT GRILLED CHEESE
 SANDWICH INTO?

00:13.013 --> 00:16.317
I WAS 4.
 COME ON, I´M THIRSTY.

00:16.317 --> 00:20.321
THERE´S WATER
 IN THE RAIN GUTTERS.

00:20.321 --> 00:23.694
THIS TONING CREAM
 IS ONLY $39.95.

00:23.694 --> 00:26.257
AND LA MARIE GUARANTEES
 IF YOUR HUSBAND DOES NOT

00:26.257 --> 00:30.201
FIND YOU MORE ATTRACTIVE,
 YOU GET YOUR MONEY BACK.

00:30.201 --> 00:33.334
IF YOU REALLY WANT YOUR HUSBAND
 TO THINK YOU´RE MORE ATTRACTIVE,

00:33.334 --> 00:37.208
BUY HIM A SIX-PACK OF THESE.

00:37.208 --> 00:40.571
MAYBE A LITTLE SCOTCH, TOO.

00:40.571 --> 00:44.415
YOU KNOW WHAT? I´LL JUST PAY
 FOR THE THINGS I ORDERED.

00:44.415 --> 00:46.117
THANKS, THOUGH.

00:46.117 --> 00:48.679
ARE YOU SURE I CAN´T
 INTEREST YOU IN ANYTHING ELSE?

00:48.679 --> 00:50.321
I DON´T THINK SO.

00:50.321 --> 00:51.322
OH, MY GOD!

00:51.322 --> 00:53.384
WHAT?

00:53.384 --> 00:54.555
OH...MY GOD.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.287
WHAT IS IT?

00:56.287 --> 00:58.259
WE JUST GOT ANOTHER HUGE BILL
 FROM CARMEN´S SCHOOL.

00:58.259 --> 01:00.661
IF YOU DON´T SELL SOME MORE
 COSMETICS -- I DON´T KNOW!

01:00.661 --> 01:03.394
I JUST -- I DON´T KNOW!

01:03.394 --> 01:07.298
I´M SORRY, JEAN. YOU SHOULDN´T
 SEE ME LIKE THIS.

01:07.298 --> 01:10.471
I DON´T WANT TO MAKE
 THAT PRETTY FACE SAD.

01:14.175 --> 01:17.408
YOU KNOW WHAT? ORDER ME A COUPLE
 OF JARS OF THAT TONING CREAM.

01:17.408 --> 01:20.281
YOU NEED THREE.
 RIGHT.

01:20.281 --> 01:23.284
JUST DON´T MAKE ME
 LOOK TOO YOUNG.

01:23.284 --> 01:26.587
I DON´T WANT ANYBODY TO THINK
 MY HUSBAND´S A CRADLE ROBBER.

01:29.460 --> 01:32.693
SHE´S WORRIED ABOUT LOOKING
 TOO YOUNG FOR HER HUSBAND,

01:32.693 --> 01:37.428
SHE OUGHTA JUST WHIP OUT
 THOSE CHICHIS.

01:37.428 --> 01:40.231
GEORGE, THIS IS SO GREAT.

01:40.231 --> 01:42.303
IF WE CAN SELL ALL
 THE BEAUTY PRODUCTS

01:42.303 --> 01:43.674
THAT I HAVE IN THE GARAGE,
 WE CAN PAY OFF CARMEN´S

01:43.674 --> 01:45.336
SCHOOL LOAN IN NO TIME!

01:45.336 --> 01:47.238
ALL RIGHT, BABY. OKAY,
 LET´S CELEBRATE AT DINNER.

01:47.238 --> 01:49.109
HEY, AND IF YOU TALK
 TO ONE UGLY PERSON,

01:49.109 --> 01:52.843
WE CAN WRITE IT OFF
 AS A BUSINESS EXPENSE.

01:52.843 --> 01:54.845
HONEY, GRANDMA´S GOING
 TO BE WATCHING YOU.

01:54.845 --> 01:56.617
ORDER A PIZZA
 IF YOU GET HUNGRY, OKAY?

01:56.617 --> 01:58.319
CAN RICKY EAT
 IN THE KITCHEN?

01:58.319 --> 02:01.852
CAN I STICK A VIDEOTAPE IN RICKY
 AND WATCH "TRAINING DAY"?

02:07.798 --> 02:09.630
YOU GOT THE STUFF?
 YOU GOT THE MONEY?

02:09.630 --> 02:12.733
SHOW ME THE STUFF.
 SHOW ME THE MONEY.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.905
LISTEN, I JUST WANT
 A FIRECRACKER.

02:14.905 --> 02:16.907
IF YOU JUST WANT
 A FIRECRACKER,

02:16.907 --> 02:19.840
I´M NOT YOUR GUY,
 BUT IF YOU WANT M-80s,

02:19.840 --> 02:22.243
ROMAN CANDLES,
 AND BOTTLE ROCKETS,

02:22.243 --> 02:24.245
YOU´VE COME
 TO THE RIGHT PLACE.

02:24.245 --> 02:27.248
WOW. HOW MUCH
 FOR A BOTTLE ROCKET?

02:27.248 --> 02:29.920
I´LL TELL YOU WHAT.
 THE FIRST ONE´S FREE.

02:29.920 --> 02:31.652
BUT THEN HOW DO YOU MAKE
 ANY MONEY?

02:31.652 --> 02:34.255
YOU LET ME WORRY ABOUT THAT.

02:34.255 --> 02:36.457
I WANT TO DO IT
 RIGHT HERE.

02:36.457 --> 02:39.890
OF COURSE YOU DO.

02:58.549 --> 03:00.281
WHERE´D IT GO?

03:00.281 --> 03:02.313
I DON´T KNOW.

03:07.558 --> 03:09.790
MOM! I SAW THE FIRE TRUCKS
 OUTSIDE. IS EVERYBODY OKAY?

03:09.790 --> 03:11.562
WHERE ARE THE KIDS?

03:11.562 --> 03:14.465
EVERYBODY IS OKAY. WE JUST HAD
 A SMALL FIRE IN THE GARAGE.

03:14.465 --> 03:15.696
THE GARAGE?

03:15.696 --> 03:18.198
[ GASPS ]

03:20.571 --> 03:24.305
OH, NO.

03:24.305 --> 03:26.807
ALL MY LA MARIE BOXES!

03:26.807 --> 03:29.840
ANGIE, BE CAREFUL!

03:29.840 --> 03:31.442
WHAT THE HELL
 WERE YOU THINKING?

03:31.442 --> 03:33.844
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU
 THAT THIS

03:33.844 --> 03:36.447
ISN´T PUTTING OUT
 A CIGARETTE?

03:36.447 --> 03:37.818
IT WASN´T ME!

03:37.818 --> 03:40.451
I FLICK IT
 TO THE NEIGHBOR´S YARD

03:40.451 --> 03:42.593
LIKE DECENT PEOPLE.

03:42.593 --> 03:44.895
WHAT THE HELL
 WERE YOU THINKING?

03:44.895 --> 03:46.997
WHY ARE YOU
 ACCUSING ME?

03:46.997 --> 03:49.360
YOU SNUCK OUT OF THE HOUSE,
 YOU GOT A HICKEY,

03:49.360 --> 03:50.661
YOU SMOKED A CIGARETTE,

03:50.661 --> 03:53.604
YOU ARE ONE HARD LEMONADE
 AWAY FROM ARSON.

03:53.604 --> 03:54.935
I DID IT.

03:54.935 --> 03:56.767
I KNEW IT.

03:56.767 --> 03:59.910
WHAT DID YOU DO TO MAKE YOUR
 BROTHER BURN THE GARAGE DOWN?

03:59.910 --> 04:01.512
RICKY GAVE ME
 A BOTTLE ROCKET,

04:01.512 --> 04:03.274
AND I SHOT IT OFF,

04:03.274 --> 04:05.476
BUT I DIDN´T KNOW IT WOULD
 LAND ON THE GARAGE.

04:05.476 --> 04:07.348
I´M REALLY SORRY, DAD.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.450
SORRY DOESN´T CUT IT.
 YOU CAN SAY GOODBYE

04:09.450 --> 04:11.322
TO YOUR ALLOWANCE
 FOR THE NEXT YEAR.

04:11.322 --> 04:13.284
BUT, DAD --
 NO, I DON´T WANT
 TO HEAR IT.

04:13.284 --> 04:15.856
MAX, YOU DESTROYED
 THE GARAGE.

04:15.856 --> 04:19.930
OH, MAN,
 MY GOLF CLUBS!

04:19.930 --> 04:22.933
NO. I PUT THEM
 IN THE CAR.

04:22.933 --> 04:26.767
NO, I PUT THEM IN THE GARAGE
 TO CLEAN THEM!

04:26.767 --> 04:30.371
NO, I PUT THEM BACK.

04:30.371 --> 04:31.802
I DON´T REMEMBER!

04:34.775 --> 04:36.777
IT´S GONE.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.909
ALL MY COSMETICS ARE GONE.

04:38.909 --> 04:42.653
WELL, THANK GOD
 WE HAVE INSURANCE.

04:42.653 --> 04:44.885
NO.

04:44.885 --> 04:47.818
OUR POLICY IS NOT GOING
 TO COVER THIS.

04:47.818 --> 04:49.960
I DIDN´T HAVE TIME
 TO DECLARE IT.

04:49.960 --> 04:52.623
SO HOW MUCH
 WAS THIS STUFF WORTH?

04:52.623 --> 04:55.926
$17,000.

04:55.926 --> 04:58.799
WE OWE $17,000?

04:58.799 --> 05:00.871
WELL, I HAVE TO PAY
 FOR THE INVENTORY,

05:00.871 --> 05:03.303
AND I CAN´T SELL IT
 TO ANYBODY NOW!

05:03.303 --> 05:05.075
WELL, WHAT THE HELL
 WERE YOU THINKING

05:05.075 --> 05:07.378
KEEPING THAT MUCH INVENTORY IN
 THE GARAGE IN THE FIRST PLACE?

05:07.378 --> 05:09.410
I WAS DREAMING IT
 AND BELIEVING IT

05:09.410 --> 05:11.712
LIKE THEY SAY ON PAGE 3
 OF THE MANUAL!

05:11.712 --> 05:13.384
"I" IS FOR "INSIST
 THEY BUY IT,"

05:13.384 --> 05:15.386
"N" IS "NEVER TAKE NO
 FOR AN ANSWER,"

05:15.386 --> 05:17.317
"V" IS FOR "VOLUME,
 VOLUME, VOLUME"...

05:17.317 --> 05:21.792
I´M DYSLEXIC!
 DON´T SPELL AT ME!

05:21.792 --> 05:26.627
WE CAN´T AFFORD
 TO PAY $17,000, NOT NOW!

05:26.627 --> 05:29.430
NOT WITH EVERYTHING ELSE
 WE´RE TRYING TO COVER!

05:29.430 --> 05:33.664
ANGIE, WE´RE SCREWED.

05:33.664 --> 05:35.406
MY LUCKY PUTTER.

05:37.608 --> 05:39.370

AAH!

♫ ALL MY FRIENDS ♫

06:00.060 --> 06:03.864
♫ KNOW THE LOW RIDER ♫

06:33.093 --> 06:35.796
YES, $17,000
 IS A HUGE AMOUNT,

06:35.796 --> 06:39.169
BUT WHY DOES LA MARIE NEED IT
 IN TWO WEEKS?

06:39.169 --> 06:40.771
OH, COME ON.

06:40.771 --> 06:42.533
LIKE IT SAYS IN THE MANUAL,
 WE´RE ALL SISTERS.

06:42.533 --> 06:45.175
"S" IS FOR SOLIDARITY,
 "I" IS FOR INSPIRATION...

06:45.175 --> 06:49.910
VERY NICE. YOU PUT LA MARIE
 LIPSTICK ON THAT MOUTH?

06:54.615 --> 06:58.018
HEY, YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN WORKING
 ALL MORNING. NOW, WHO´S HUNGRY?

06:58.018 --> 06:59.820
NOT ME.

06:59.820 --> 07:03.594
I´M SKIPPING ONE MEAL EVERY DAY
 TO HELP PAY FOR THE GARAGE.

07:03.594 --> 07:05.926
YOU´RE GOING
 TO NEED YOUR STRENGTH.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.928
BECAUSE I´M GOING
 TO HIRE A MONKEY,

07:07.928 --> 07:11.061
AND HE´S GOING TO GRIND
 AND YOU´RE GOING TO DANCE.

07:11.061 --> 07:13.163
MY OWN MONKEY?

07:13.163 --> 07:15.165
NO, HE OWNS YOU.

07:15.165 --> 07:18.068
COME ON, YOU GUYS. LET´S JUST
 TRY TO FORGET ABOUT THE MONEY

07:18.068 --> 07:20.010
AND HAVE SOME BREAKFAST.

07:20.010 --> 07:23.173
HOW ABOUT SOME SCRAMBLED EGGS,
 WE´LL CALL MY DAD FOR A LOAN,

07:23.173 --> 07:25.516
AND MAYBE SOME FRENCH TOAST?

07:25.516 --> 07:27.948
NO, I´M NOT TAKING MONEY
 FROM YOUR DAD.

07:27.948 --> 07:31.552
OKAY, OKAY.
 THEN HOW ABOUT SOME WAFFLES,

07:31.552 --> 07:34.885
PLEASE JUST SWALLOW YOUR PRIDE,
 AND MAYBE SOME ORANGE JUICE?

07:34.885 --> 07:36.927
YOU KNOW HOW MANY YEARS
 IT TOOK ME

07:36.927 --> 07:38.929
TO GET YOUR FATHER´S RESPECT?
 AND NOW YOU WANT ME TO ASK HIM

07:38.929 --> 07:41.532
FOR MONEY BECAUSE I CAN´T
 MEET MY OBLIGATIONS?

07:41.532 --> 07:43.063
THAT´S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

07:43.063 --> 07:45.195
WELL, YOUR PRIDE IS NOT GOING
 TO PAY FOR THE COSMETICS.

07:45.195 --> 07:46.667
WELL, I WOULDN´T HAVE TO PAY

07:46.667 --> 07:48.669
IF MAX HADN´T BURNED
 THE GARAGE DOWN.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.470
THE GARAGE WOULDN´T
 HAVE BURNED DOWN

07:50.470 --> 07:52.472
IF CARMEN HADN´T TAKEN
 THE BATTERY

07:52.472 --> 07:55.876
OUT OF THE SMOKE DETECTOR
 FOR HER CD PLAYER!

07:55.876 --> 07:57.948
WELL, NONE OF THIS
 WOULD´VE HAPPENED

07:57.948 --> 08:01.712
IF GRANDMA WAS WATCHING MAX
 INSTEAD OF "SáBADO GIGANTE."

08:01.712 --> 08:04.585
YEAH, WHO GETS A JOB
 WHERE THEY HAVE TO KEEP

08:04.585 --> 08:07.187
$17,000 WORTH OF BEAUTY CRAP
 IN THE GARAGE?

08:07.187 --> 08:09.019
I WILL TELL YOU WHO!

08:09.019 --> 08:12.763
SOMEONE WHO CAN´T TYPE.
 [ GASPS ]

08:12.763 --> 08:16.266
STOP IT. WE ARE NOT
 GOING TO SOLVE THIS

08:16.266 --> 08:18.569
BY TURNING
 ON EACH OTHER.

08:18.569 --> 08:21.572
YOU´RE RIGHT. WE SHOULD
 FOCUS ON THE BOY.

08:21.572 --> 08:22.833
NO, WE HAVE TO FOCUS

08:22.833 --> 08:25.175
ON HOW WE´RE GOING
 TO GET THE MONEY.

08:25.175 --> 08:27.738
LOOK, I´LL START BY TRYING
 TO GET ANOTHER JOB,

08:27.738 --> 08:29.640
BUT WE´VE ALREADY TAKEN
 A SECOND MORTGAGE

08:29.640 --> 08:31.682
FOR CARMEN´S PRIVATE SCHOOL,

08:31.682 --> 08:34.014
AND OUR CREDIT CARDS
 ARE MAXED OUT.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.285
WELL, WHY DON´T
 WE JUST CALL YOUR DAD?

08:36.285 --> 08:37.888
WE KNOW HE´S RICH.

08:37.888 --> 08:40.090
NO WAY. HE NEVER HELPED
 ME AND MY MOM

08:40.090 --> 08:41.692
BACK WHEN WE NEEDED IT,

08:41.692 --> 08:44.024
SO I´M NOT GOING HAT IN HAND
 TO HIM NOW.

08:44.024 --> 08:47.097
YOUR FATHER´S RIGHT.
 WE WILL FIGURE THIS OUT.

08:47.097 --> 08:50.701
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
 IS THAT NONE OF US

08:50.701 --> 08:52.002
WERE INJURED,

08:52.002 --> 08:54.134
AND WE ALL STILL
 HAVE EACH OTHER.

08:54.134 --> 08:57.808
STITCH IT ON A PILLOW,

 TO YOU FOR A MINUTE?

09:06.176 --> 09:08.548

I GOT A LOT
 ON MY MIND RIGHT NOW.

HERE, OPEN THIS. I THINK
 IT´LL CHEER YOU UP.

09:12.082 --> 09:14.725
IS A GIANT SNAKE
 GOING TO JUMP OUT?

09:14.725 --> 09:16.757
BECAUSE IT WASN´T FUNNY
 AT MY UNCLE´S FUNERAL,

09:16.757 --> 09:18.759
AND IT´S NOT GOING
 TO BE FUNNY NOW.

09:18.759 --> 09:20.831
JUST OPEN IT.

09:22.693 --> 09:25.095
HOLY CRAP,
 HOW MUCH IS THIS?

 WHY NOT?

09:37.848 --> 09:39.950
BECAUSE IT´S NOT ENOUGH.

09:39.950 --> 09:43.253
I GOTTA HAVE THE WHOLE $17,000
 BY NEXT WEEK.

09:43.253 --> 09:45.856
OKAY.

 NOT THE BEST OPTION,

OUT OF HIS TRUNK?

I DON´T THINK SO, MAN.

10:02.332 --> 10:07.377
OKAY, WELL, THEN, UM,
 HOW ABOUT SOME PEANUT BRITTLE?

10:07.377 --> 10:09.139
IS THE SNAKE IN THERE?

10:09.139 --> 10:10.941
NO.

 SOME PEANUT BRITTLE?

10:14.014 --> 10:16.887
BAD CAREER MOVE,
 DUDE.

10:16.887 --> 10:19.249
YOU WANTED TO SEE US,
 GEORGE?

10:19.249 --> 10:21.091
YEAH, UH, LISTEN, GUYS,

10:21.091 --> 10:23.623
I NEVER DID THIS
 WHEN I WAS ON THE LINE,

10:23.623 --> 10:26.857
AND IT´S KIND OF EMBARRASSING
 NOW THAT I´M MANAGER...

 IN A TIGHT SPOT, MAN.

10:28.759 --> 10:30.901

 I COULD GET AN ADVANCE.

10:30.901 --> 10:32.803
WELL, SURE, GEORGE.
 YEAH, NO PROBLEM.

10:32.803 --> 10:34.965
I´VE GOT $60.
 HERE´S, UH, $40.

10:34.965 --> 10:37.407
ACTUALLY, I WAS HOPING
 FOR A LITTLE MORE, LIKE,

10:37.407 --> 10:39.770
TWO, MAYBE THREE MONTHS´
 SALARY.

10:39.770 --> 10:41.271
NO.
 NO, NO...

10:41.271 --> 10:43.844
GEORGE, WE CAN´T GIVE YOU
 THAT KIND OF ADVANCE.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.215
WELL, HOW ABOUT
 JUST A MONTH?

10:45.215 --> 10:47.217
NO, NO CAN DO.
 IT´S AGAINST COMPANY POLICY.

10:47.217 --> 10:49.219
LOOK, IF WE BREAK
 THE RULES FOR YOU,

10:49.219 --> 10:53.023
THEN WE´LL HAVE
 TO BREAK THEM FOR EVERYBODY.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.989
SO YOU´RE, UH,

10:58.989 --> 11:01.892
YOU´RE REALLY IN A TIGHT SPOT,
 HUH, GEORGE?

11:01.892 --> 11:03.363
YEAH, I AM.

11:09.900 --> 11:12.072
I´M UNCOMFORTABLE.

11:12.072 --> 11:13.443
YOU?

11:13.443 --> 11:17.347
YEAH.

11:26.056 --> 11:28.889
NO LUCK, HUH?
 NO.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.060
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
 TO DO NOW?

11:30.060 --> 11:31.992
I HAVE NO IDEA, MOM.

11:31.992 --> 11:33.794
THINGS HAVE NEVER BEEN
 THIS BAD.

11:33.794 --> 11:37.127
I GOT TO COME UP WITH SOME MONEY
 FAST, OR I´M GOING TO GET SUED.

11:37.127 --> 11:40.200
LISTEN, I´M SORRY I´M NOT RICH
 LIKE YOUR FATHER.

11:40.200 --> 11:44.034
YOU KNOW IF I HAD MANNY´S KIND
 OF MONEY, I´D HELP YOU OUT.

11:44.034 --> 11:46.106
THANKS, MOM.

12:03.353 --> 12:08.158
PHOENIX, PLEASE.

12:08.158 --> 12:12.432
THE NUMBER
 FOR A MANNY LOPEZ.

12:27.477 --> 12:28.879
BENNY LOPEZ?

12:28.879 --> 12:31.451
LYDIA LOPEZ?

12:33.153 --> 12:35.956
THANKS FOR MEETING ME.

12:35.956 --> 12:38.088
I CAME TO PHOENIX

12:38.088 --> 12:40.230
BECAUSE I WANTED TO DO THIS
 FACE TO FACE.

12:40.230 --> 12:41.932
I´LL TELL YOU SOMETHING,
 I NEVER THOUGHT

12:41.932 --> 12:44.494
I´D BE SITTING ACROSS
 FROM MANNY´S FIRST WIFE.

12:44.494 --> 12:47.367
WELL, YOU WOULDN´T BE
 IF I THOUGHT I COULD STOMACH

12:47.367 --> 12:49.769
SITTING ACROSS FROM MANNY.

12:53.343 --> 12:55.005
I DON´T SEE IT.

12:55.005 --> 12:56.146
WHAT?

12:56.146 --> 12:58.478
MANNY LEFT ME FOR YOU.

12:58.478 --> 13:01.051
YOU KNOW, I´M NOT SAYING
 YOU´RE UGLY OR ANYTHING,

13:01.051 --> 13:02.953
I JUST DON´T SEE IT.

13:02.953 --> 13:05.785
LET´S KEEP THIS CIVIL.
 WE COULD FIGHT...

13:05.785 --> 13:08.458
I COULD REPEAT EVERYTHING THAT
 MANNY HAS SAID ABOUT YOU,

13:08.458 --> 13:11.822
BUT THAT´S NOT GOING
 TO GET US ANYWHERE.

13:11.822 --> 13:13.523
YOU´RE RIGHT.

13:13.523 --> 13:17.797
WHAT´D THAT JACKASS SAY?

13:17.797 --> 13:20.130
WELL, HE SAID THAT YOU WERE
 THE FIRST WOMAN

13:20.130 --> 13:23.573
THAT HE EVER DANCED WITH,
 THE FIRST WOMAN HE MARRIED.

13:23.573 --> 13:27.838
HE SAID YOU WERE THE FIRST WOMAN
 TO PULL A KNIFE ON HIM.

13:27.838 --> 13:30.580
HE SAID THAT?

13:30.580 --> 13:33.243
BENNY, WHY AM I HERE?

13:33.243 --> 13:36.516
LISTEN.

13:36.516 --> 13:39.319
MANNY OWES ME A CRAPLOAD
 OF MONEY

13:39.319 --> 13:41.321
FOR LEAVING ME AND MY KID.

13:41.321 --> 13:44.524
HE GOT RICH.
 HE NEVER GAVE US A DIME.

13:44.524 --> 13:46.857
LISTEN, IT TOOK A LONG TIME

13:46.857 --> 13:49.229
FOR MANNY TO BUILD UP
 HIS COMPANY.

13:49.229 --> 13:51.561
HE DIDN´T HAVE ANY MONEY
 TO GIVE

13:51.561 --> 13:54.004
UNTIL GEORGE
 WAS ALREADY GROWN.

13:54.004 --> 13:56.136
WELL, NOW HE DOES,

13:56.136 --> 13:58.308
AND GEORGE IS IN TROUBLE.

13:58.308 --> 14:00.240
HE NEEDS $17,000.

14:00.240 --> 14:04.344
AND MANNY SHOULD DO AT LEAST
 ONE NICE THING FOR HIS SON.

14:04.344 --> 14:07.447
SO, WHY DOESN´T GEORGE JUST GO
 TO MANNY FOR THE MONEY?

14:07.447 --> 14:09.349
GEORGE IS TOO PROUD
 TO GO TO HIM.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.581
HE WON´T TAKE THE MONEY UNLESS
 HE THINKS IT´S COMING FROM ME.

14:11.581 --> 14:14.554
SO YOU WRITE ME A CHECK,
 AND I´LL TELL HIM

14:14.554 --> 14:18.358
I WON IT AT THE TRACK
 OR SOMETHING.

14:18.358 --> 14:22.162
OKAY, I´LL TALK TO MANNY.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.094
GOOD.

14:24.094 --> 14:27.237
I GUESS WE COULD ORDER
 SOMETHING TO EAT.

14:27.237 --> 14:29.499
WE DON´T HAVE TO.

14:29.499 --> 14:33.103
THAT´S FINE WITH ME.

14:33.103 --> 14:34.905
OH...

14:34.905 --> 14:37.447
BENNY, DO YOU WANT
 TO TAKE A POOPY

14:37.447 --> 14:41.011
BEFORE YOU GO
 IN THE CAR?

14:44.584 --> 14:48.458
I DON´T THINK THAT´S ANY
 OF YOUR BUSINESS.

14:51.591 --> 14:56.266
AW...YEAH, I HEARD
 HE NAMED THE DOG AFTER ME.

14:56.266 --> 14:59.930
YOU KNOW, I SHOULD NAME
 SOMETHING AFTER HIM, TOO.

14:59.930 --> 15:02.532
I´LL CALL YOU AS SOON AS I HEAR
 ABOUT THE MONEY.

15:02.532 --> 15:04.604
IS THAT ALL RIGHT?
 YEAH.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.606
HERE´S MY NUMBER,
 BUT LET IT RING...

15:06.606 --> 15:09.079
I MIGHT BE ON THE MANNY.

15:12.983 --> 15:16.246
EXCUSE ME, I´M LOOKING
 FOR YURI.

15:16.246 --> 15:18.618
SERGEI AT MY PLANT TOLD ME
 THERE WAS A YURI HERE

15:18.618 --> 15:20.951
WHO COULD, YOU KNOW,
 HELP ME WITH A PROBLEM.

15:20.951 --> 15:24.324
[ Russian accent ]
 LITTLE PROBLEM OR BIG PROBLEM?

15:24.324 --> 15:26.696
I NEED 17 GRAND.

15:26.696 --> 15:29.299
OH, TEENY-WEENY PROBLEM.
 HAVE A SEAT.

15:29.299 --> 15:31.561
MAN, LISTEN,

15:31.561 --> 15:33.663
MY SON LIT
 THIS BOTTLE ROCKET,

15:33.663 --> 15:35.165
AND MY GARAGE BURNED DOWN,

15:35.165 --> 15:36.666
MY WIFE´S COSMETICS
 WERE IN THE GARAGE --

15:36.666 --> 15:39.139
PLEASE, MY DAY ENDS AT 5:00.

15:39.139 --> 15:44.014
IT´S 20% INTEREST.
 YOU PAY IT BACK IN A YEAR.

15:44.014 --> 15:45.645
SOUNDS FAIR.

15:45.645 --> 15:49.519
ONE MORE THING, I NEED YOU
 TO DRIVE A CAR TO MEXICO.

15:49.519 --> 15:52.952
OKAY, NICE DOING BUSINESS
 WITH YOU.

15:52.952 --> 15:56.386
NO, NO, YOU JUST TAKE
 A NICE DRIVE OVER TO BORDER.

15:56.386 --> 15:58.088
IS THERE SOMETHING
 IN THE CAR?

15:58.088 --> 16:00.430
NO, JUST A NICE
 NEW SPORTS CAR.

16:00.430 --> 16:03.063
ONE THING, DON´T ANSWER
 CELL PHONE.

16:03.063 --> 16:06.997
DUDE, I GOT A FAMILY. I CAN´T
 DRIVE A HOT CAR TO MEXICO.

16:06.997 --> 16:08.999
OKAY, I UNDERSTAND.
 FORGET THAT.

16:08.999 --> 16:11.141
YOU GO TO MEXICO.
 DRIVE A CAR BACK.

16:11.141 --> 16:14.144
WITH WHAT,
 DRUGS IN THE TRUNK?

16:14.144 --> 16:14.744
NO.

16:14.744 --> 16:17.677
CHINESE PEOPLE.

16:17.677 --> 16:21.711
LOOK, YOU´RE NOT GOING
 TO EXPECT THIS COMING FROM ME,

16:21.711 --> 16:26.216
BUT I´M ACTUALLY IN FAVOR
 OF TIGHTER BORDER CONTROLS.

16:26.216 --> 16:28.488
I´M OUTTA HERE.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.595
[ KNOCK ON DOOR ]

16:39.529 --> 16:41.531
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

16:41.531 --> 16:42.732
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
 TO CALL ME.

16:42.732 --> 16:44.504
I HAVE A CHECK FOR GEORGE.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.507
GREAT. GIVE IT TO ME,
 AND THEN YOU CAN GO.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.779
NO, BENNY. MANNY SAYS
 TO GIVE THE MONEY

16:49.779 --> 16:52.542
DIRECTLY TO GEORGE,
 AND HE SAID THAT ON OCCASIONS

16:52.542 --> 16:57.016
YOU HAVE BEEN AN UNRELIABLE
 COURIER OF CASH.

16:59.389 --> 17:01.291
ARE YOU GEORGE LOPEZ?

17:01.291 --> 17:03.723
WELL, HEY, LISTEN,
 IF YOU´RE HERE FROM LA MARIE,

17:03.723 --> 17:06.425
I´M JUST GOING
 TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

17:06.425 --> 17:09.398
MY WIFE LEFT ME AND TOOK
 ALL THE COSMETICS.

17:09.398 --> 17:11.661
THIS IS NOT A GOOD TIME.

17:11.661 --> 17:14.204
ALL I WANTED
 WAS SOMEBODY TO LOVE.

17:14.204 --> 17:17.267
I´M NOT FROM LA MARIE.

17:17.267 --> 17:19.339
NO, SHE´S FROM
 THREE BLOCKS OVER.

17:19.339 --> 17:20.609
ALZHEIMER´S.

17:20.609 --> 17:24.544
I´M TAKING YOU HOME
 NOW, EDNA.

17:24.544 --> 17:27.547
GEORGE, I´M LYDIA.

17:27.547 --> 17:31.050
I´M YOUR FATHER´S WIFE.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.753
WHAT´S GOING ON?

17:33.753 --> 17:35.585
I DON´T KNOW.

17:35.585 --> 17:38.728
MOM, WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?
 WHAT DID YOU DO?

17:38.728 --> 17:40.660
SHE CAME TO SEE ME IN PHOENIX.
 SHE SAID YOU NEEDED HELP.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.562
LOOK, I DON´T CARE
 WHAT SHE SAID.

17:42.562 --> 17:43.763
PLEASE HEAR ME OUT.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.635
YOUR FATHER
 WAS VERY TOUCHED

17:45.635 --> 17:47.767
WHEN HE HEARD THAT
 YOU WERE LOOKING FOR HIM.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.140
HE KNOWS THAT HE HASN´T BEEN
 THERE FOR YOU ALL THESE YEARS,

17:50.140 --> 17:52.502
BUT HE WANTS TO BE THERE
 FOR YOU NOW.

17:52.502 --> 17:54.644
HERE´S A CHECK
 FOR $20,000.

17:54.644 --> 17:57.347
HE DOESN´T CARE
 HOW MUCH MONEY IT TAKES.

17:57.347 --> 18:02.782
HE JUST WANTS TO MAKE THINGS
 RIGHT BETWEEN YOU AND HIM.

18:02.782 --> 18:04.284
HONEY...

18:04.284 --> 18:07.317
GEORGE, IT WOULD MEAN
 A GREAT DEAL TO HIM

18:07.317 --> 18:09.419
IF YOU TOOK IT.

18:09.419 --> 18:11.121
HE´LL TAKE IT.

18:13.263 --> 18:14.624
I´M SORRY.

18:14.624 --> 18:16.796
I CAN´T DEAL WITH THIS.

18:16.796 --> 18:19.299
I MEAN, I REALLY APPRECIATE
 YOU COMING HERE,

18:19.299 --> 18:21.401
BUT I CAN´T TALK RIGHT NOW.

18:21.401 --> 18:24.134
OKAY, I UNDERSTAND.
 BUT I´M SURE YOU WOULD WANT

18:24.134 --> 18:26.506
TO CALL YOUR FATHER
 AND THANK HIM.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.238
I´LL CALL.

18:28.238 --> 18:29.739
OKAY.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.489
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?

18:39.489 --> 18:41.751
WHAT THE HELL
 WERE YOU THINKING, MOM?

18:41.751 --> 18:43.753
DO YOU EVEN KNOW
 WHO I AM?

18:43.753 --> 18:45.695
YOU WEREN´T HELPING YOURSELF,
 SO SOMEBODY HAD TO HELP YOU.

18:45.695 --> 18:47.697
I´M YOUR MOTHER.
 YOU DON´T COME TO ME AND SAY,

18:47.697 --> 18:49.859
"I DON´T KNOW WHAT TO DO,"
 AND EXPECT ME TO DO NOTHING.

18:49.859 --> 18:52.702
YES, I DO.
 IF THERE WAS ANYBODY

18:52.702 --> 18:54.664
I COULD TELL
 MY WORST TROUBLES TO

18:54.664 --> 18:57.637
AND EXPECT TO DO NOTHING,
 IT WAS YOU!

18:57.637 --> 18:59.709
DON´T BE STUPID, GEORGE.

18:59.709 --> 19:01.871
SWALLOW YOUR PRIDE,
 AND TAKE THE CHECK.

19:01.871 --> 19:03.673
YOU NEED IT.

19:03.673 --> 19:05.515
I´LL TELL YOU WHAT I NEED.

19:05.515 --> 19:07.577
I NEED YOU
 TO STAY OUT OF MY BUSINESS.

19:07.577 --> 19:09.679
THIS IS MY PROBLEM,
 AND I´LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

19:09.679 --> 19:11.451
WHOA. YOUR PROBLEM?

19:11.451 --> 19:13.283
THIS DOESN´T AFFECT JUST YOU.

19:13.283 --> 19:15.525
THIS AFFECTS EVERYONE
 IN THE FAMILY.

19:15.525 --> 19:17.657
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

19:17.657 --> 19:18.928
I´M SAYING WE´RE IN TROUBLE,

19:18.928 --> 19:21.491
AND WE´RE RUNNING OUT
 OF OPTIONS.

19:21.491 --> 19:23.633
MAYBE...YOU SHOULD THINK
 ABOUT IT

19:23.633 --> 19:26.536
BEFORE YOU TEAR UP
 THAT CHECK.

19:34.344 --> 19:36.806
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

19:36.806 --> 19:39.609
I THINK I´M GOING TO PHOENIX.
