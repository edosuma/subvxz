00:01.334 --> 00:03.268
Does everybody know what time it is?

00:03.336 --> 00:05.099
<i>Tool Time!</i>

00:05.205 --> 00:09.767
That's right. Binford Tools is proud
to present Tim ''The Tool Man'' Taylor!

00:09.843 --> 00:12.141
[cheering]

00:13.980 --> 00:15.743
Thank you.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.180
Thank you, everybody.

00:18.118 --> 00:21.610
<i>Thank you, Heidi, our Tool Time
mother-to-be.</i>

00:21.688 --> 00:23.918
[cheering]

00:23.990 --> 00:26.857
<i>Welcome to Tool Time.
l am Tim ''The Tool Man'' Taylor.</i>

00:26.926 --> 00:29.793
Of course, you all know my assistant,
Al Borland.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.296
[cheering]

00:33.433 --> 00:36.334
Yesterday we showed you how to treat
an electrical burn.

00:41.141 --> 00:43.302
And a thermal burn.

00:44.911 --> 00:49.075
Now we're showing the important part,
fire safety equipment for the home.

00:49.149 --> 00:50.878
[siren sounding]

00:50.950 --> 00:54.613
The most important piece of equipment
in your home is the smoke alarm.

00:54.687 --> 00:57.155
We suggest putting one of these
in every room.

00:57.223 --> 01:00.454
And if you're like Tim
you should wear one on you belt.

01:05.331 --> 01:08.630
lt's also important to have
a quality chemical extinguisher.

01:08.701 --> 01:11.397
Right. Now, what if
your extinguisher is empty

01:11.471 --> 01:12.961
and the fire is spreading?

01:13.039 --> 01:15.530
Run like hell
and hope you have good insurance.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.135
Binford has a better idea.

01:18.211 --> 01:19.974
They always do, Al.

01:20.046 --> 01:21.809
Show us what they got.

01:21.881 --> 01:25.908
lntroducing the Binford 61 00
Home Fireman.

01:26.419 --> 01:28.478
lt taps right into your cold water line.

01:28.555 --> 01:32.389
You want to be sure the main valve
is in the ''o' position when stored.

01:32.459 --> 01:34.791
Now, you got 40 feet of hose,

01:34.861 --> 01:36.351
double hose construction

01:36.429 --> 01:38.659
<i>and a separate onloff switch right here.</i>

01:38.731 --> 01:40.062
- [man screaming]
- Oh!

01:43.970 --> 01:48.464
That's perfect if you want to put out
a cigarette or irritated Teamster.

01:51.211 --> 01:54.738
- But a real man needs real protection.
- What are you talking about?

01:54.814 --> 01:57.510
l remodeled a little more power
to the home fireman.

01:57.584 --> 02:02.078
- Uh, fire safety is no joking matter.
- l'm not joking about this, Al.

02:02.155 --> 02:04.783
Tim, this hose is not constructed
for any more pressure.

02:04.858 --> 02:07.349
l don't want to get wet.
The audience doesn't want to.

02:07.427 --> 02:11.363
Al! Ladies and gentlemen, the Tim Taylor
version of The Home Fireman.

02:11.431 --> 02:13.524
Ladies and gentlemen, take cover!

03:11.491 --> 03:14.460
Well, they finally settled
my Aunt Sharon's estate.

03:14.527 --> 03:16.188
Cool. What's our cut?

03:18.698 --> 03:20.825
Brad, don't be disrespectful.

03:20.900 --> 03:23.425
Brad. What's our cut?

03:26.272 --> 03:27.830
Oh, my God.

03:27.907 --> 03:30.068
lt's $56,000!

03:30.143 --> 03:32.907
She's giving us 56,000 smackaroonies?

03:32.979 --> 03:34.879
Well, no, to me and my sisters.

03:34.948 --> 03:37.314
Split it five ways? Ugh.

03:37.383 --> 03:40.147
lnheritance tax, probate costs,
lawyer fees,

03:40.220 --> 03:42.586
tolls, tips, gratuities, who knows?

03:42.655 --> 03:44.816
Well, how much do you think
is gonna be left?

03:44.924 --> 03:48.382
Put it this way. Your Aunt Sharon is not
the only one to end up in the hole.

03:51.331 --> 03:52.889
l don't think so.

03:52.999 --> 03:55.763
Look at this.
Not too shabby.

03:55.835 --> 03:59.293
Well, did Aunt Sharon mention...
Well, l was her favorite nephew?

04:00.573 --> 04:03.337
Sorry. Apparently,
Aunt Sharon stipulated

04:03.443 --> 04:07.174
that l spend the money on myself
for something frivolous.

04:07.747 --> 04:10.113
She doesn't want me to live my life
the way she did.

04:10.216 --> 04:13.549
She didn't spend a dime on anything.
She made her own salt.

04:14.687 --> 04:17.850
l still can't believe Aunt Sharon
left us out of her will.

04:17.923 --> 04:20.084
Yeah, l mean, we were always
so nice to her.

04:20.159 --> 04:21.649
Which one was she?

04:23.329 --> 04:25.695
l believe she was the bald one.

04:25.798 --> 04:29.256
You're gonna have to narrow it down
a little more than that.

04:31.004 --> 04:34.565
Wow. lt's not gonna be easy to go out
and spend all this money on myself.

04:34.674 --> 04:37.643
Spend it on me.
At least it's going to a good cause.

04:39.145 --> 04:42.012
There's a lot of things
l could do with this money.

04:42.081 --> 04:44.379
- l could go on a trip.
- Yeah.

04:45.985 --> 04:47.748
We could go to lndy.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.885
l could buy a lot of clothes.

04:50.957 --> 04:52.652
You could wear them to lndy.

04:52.725 --> 04:54.659
Would you forget about lndy?

04:54.727 --> 04:56.820
Wow.

04:57.897 --> 05:00.388
There is one thing
that l've always wanted.

05:01.567 --> 05:03.194
l used to have this boyfriend...

05:03.269 --> 05:05.737
No, no, no.
You're not buying an old boyfriend.

05:07.573 --> 05:11.339
No! He had this really cute
little sports car

05:11.444 --> 05:13.412
and l always wanted one just like it.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.242
Wait a minute.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.478
You're considering dropping that money
on a car you don't need?

05:18.584 --> 05:20.848
- l love you. l love you.
- No.

05:21.754 --> 05:23.016
l can't. lt's too crazy.

05:23.089 --> 05:26.388
You'll look great running around
the campus in an old convertible.

05:26.459 --> 05:28.950
- Maybe a GTO or something.
- Think so? l could do that?

05:29.028 --> 05:34.159
Yes. lt's a well-known fact that driving
a muscle car makes you look younger.

05:36.202 --> 05:37.965
Well, you only go around once.

05:38.071 --> 05:41.199
lf you had a fast car you could
go around two, three times.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.502
[horn honking]

05:44.110 --> 05:46.670
l don't understand
why we have to come to a car lot.

05:46.746 --> 05:48.475
l found a bunch of cars in this paper.

05:48.548 --> 05:50.846
We'll get to these.
l want you to meet my car guy.

05:50.917 --> 05:53.283
He only deals
in real high-quality stuff.

05:53.386 --> 05:55.411
- Timmy.
- Jerry.

05:55.488 --> 05:57.547
- Timmy.
- Jerry.

05:58.658 --> 05:59.784
Jilly.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.918
- This is Jerry. My wife.
- Nice to meet you.

06:01.994 --> 06:03.757
l knew you had a good-looking Mustang.

06:03.863 --> 06:07.390
l didn't realize you had
such a good-looking wife.

06:07.467 --> 06:09.298
We're here to look at cars, Jerry.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.735
- Yeah.
- l'm looking for a convertible.

06:11.838 --> 06:14.102
- Maybe a muscle car.
- l don't want a muscle car.

06:14.173 --> 06:18.405
Oh, come on. Show her the Shelby.
Just take a look at it, please.

06:18.478 --> 06:20.639
[Jerry] lt's a beauty.

06:20.747 --> 06:24.239
- lt's got a 351 Windsor...
- A Windsor!

06:24.317 --> 06:26.751
...automatic transmission.

06:26.819 --> 06:29.379
lt's got a new convertible top
on there...

06:29.455 --> 06:31.719
l don't like the door handles.
That one is cute.

06:31.791 --> 06:33.759
The door han...?
Cute?

06:33.860 --> 06:37.159
Honey, we're buying a car, not a kitten.

06:37.964 --> 06:40.831
Well, if you're looking
for something that purrs,

06:41.467 --> 06:44.129
Tim, the '69 El Camino.

06:44.203 --> 06:46.637
l've driven this.
Great. lt's perfect for you.

06:46.706 --> 06:48.571
Half car, half truck.

06:48.641 --> 06:50.074
We could put her into this.

06:50.143 --> 06:52.043
You're not putting me into anything.

06:52.111 --> 06:55.012
- What happened to the convertible?
- You're gonna love this.

06:55.081 --> 06:57.515
lt's got it all.
lt's got a built 327...

06:57.583 --> 06:59.710
- Built 327!
- lt's four-speed.

06:59.786 --> 07:01.617
- Four-speed.
- Posit traction.

07:01.687 --> 07:06.249
Posit traction!
But, Jerry, the price is a little hefty.

07:07.026 --> 07:08.288
What can we do about that?

07:08.361 --> 07:11.194
Tim, they're numbers.
They mean nothing.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.425
Hello? Remember me?
lt's my car.

07:13.533 --> 07:15.899
Back up. l'm making a big deal here.

07:16.803 --> 07:18.327
All right, bottom line.

07:19.238 --> 07:21.263
l could take $900 off the sticker, Tim.

07:21.340 --> 07:24.639
- l'm not making a dime.
- True, 'cause l don't want this car.

07:26.479 --> 07:29.642
That's exactly how to play it.
You get the best deal that way.

07:29.749 --> 07:32.513
All right.
l'll throw in a set of new tires.

07:33.786 --> 07:37.244
- l don't want the car.
- Free undercoating.

07:39.225 --> 07:41.318
You got him right where you want him.

07:41.394 --> 07:44.761
Have you heard one word l've said?
l want to choose my own car!

07:44.864 --> 07:47.958
- And l do not want that car!
- l think you've done enough.

07:48.034 --> 07:50.901
l must have been insane to think
l could take you car shopping.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.461
- Jill.
- Save it, Timmy. Good-bye, Jerry.

07:53.539 --> 07:56.235
She's killin' me.
All right, LoJack.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.072
- LoJack!
- Yeah.

07:58.177 --> 08:00.304
- [car engine starts]
- [tires screeching]

08:02.315 --> 08:04.283
Hey, Mom.
Did you and Dad buy a new car?

08:05.418 --> 08:08.876
No. l bought a car.
Your father doesn't know about it yet.

08:08.955 --> 08:10.786
You bought a car all by yourself?

08:13.392 --> 08:16.486
- Without Dad?
- You trying to kill him or something?

08:18.598 --> 08:20.657
No, l'm not trying to kill him.

08:20.733 --> 08:24.260
He'll suffer for a little while
but he'll get over it.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.237
All right. Who gets custody of us?

08:28.074 --> 08:29.769
l think you'll want to go with me

08:29.842 --> 08:32.309
when you see the new sports car
in the garage.

08:32.378 --> 08:33.743
Cool.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.280
- Hi.
- [mocking] Hi.

08:40.186 --> 08:42.347
Thanks for leaving me at the car lot.

08:43.089 --> 08:45.751
Luckily, Jerry gave me a ride to work.

08:45.825 --> 08:49.386
Al was nice enough to drive me home
at his typical 1 5 miles per hour.

08:51.163 --> 08:54.064
l'm sorry, l shouldn't have done that.
l was angry.

08:54.767 --> 08:56.735
l was the one that got carried away.

08:57.236 --> 09:00.933
Your the one whose aunt died.
l shouldn't have spoiled your fun.

09:03.576 --> 09:06.136
You were buying the car.
You should pick it out.

09:06.245 --> 09:08.213
Well, l'm glad you feel that way.

09:08.314 --> 09:12.842
Just drive a lot of them, test them out
and l'll stay out of the whole picture.

09:12.919 --> 09:14.614
Mom, you bought a great car.

09:18.090 --> 09:20.217
You bought a car without me?

09:20.293 --> 09:22.056
Yeah, and it's really cool.

09:22.161 --> 09:23.890
We're moving in with her.

09:27.366 --> 09:29.391
l can't believe
you bought a car without me.

09:29.468 --> 09:31.197
Did you buy that stupid Alfa?

09:31.270 --> 09:34.535
No, but l think you're really gonna like
the one that l did get.

09:38.778 --> 09:40.507
lt's British!

09:43.649 --> 09:46.311
lt's a '67 Austin-Healey.

09:46.385 --> 09:48.148
l know what the heck it is!

09:48.254 --> 09:50.222
l don't know anything
about British cars.

09:50.289 --> 09:52.120
That was a big selling point.

09:54.860 --> 09:57.624
These things require
constant attention, honey.

09:57.697 --> 10:00.257
Yeah, l know. l thought
l could learn about the car,

10:00.366 --> 10:03.199
- and do some of the work myself.
- [laughing]

10:08.140 --> 10:12.975
Ooh, boy. These have a positive ground
wiring system that nobody understands.

10:13.045 --> 10:15.809
Don't get me started
on side draft carburetors.

10:15.881 --> 10:17.405
This... lt's a shocker.

10:17.483 --> 10:19.178
l don't know what to say.

10:21.621 --> 10:25.785
How about saying that you're really
happy that l got the car l wanted?

10:29.261 --> 10:31.229
All right.

10:31.330 --> 10:33.855
l... l... lt's British!

10:35.468 --> 10:38.198
These people made a fighter plane
out of wood!

10:38.270 --> 10:41.398
- Tim.
- They put kidneys in pies!

10:43.376 --> 10:46.106
What does any of that
have to do with my car?

10:46.178 --> 10:47.338
Well...

10:48.314 --> 10:50.214
l don't understand these kind of cars.

10:50.282 --> 10:53.445
So you won't understand it.
How do we know you didn't get a lemon?

10:53.519 --> 10:56.977
No. l had it checked out
by a British mechanic.

10:57.056 --> 11:00.116
A British mechanic?
What did he say, it was ducky?

11:00.192 --> 11:03.218
Nigel went over this car
bumper to bumper.

11:03.295 --> 11:06.264
He said it was in great mechanical shape
and l got a great deal.

11:06.332 --> 11:09.563
- Can l have the keys, please?
- What for?

11:09.635 --> 11:13.332
l want to take it for a little drive and
see what kind of trouble you're in.

11:13.406 --> 11:17.308
You put down my car.
You put me down for buying my car.

11:17.376 --> 11:18.934
You expect me to hand over the keys

11:19.045 --> 11:21.172
so you can tell me
what else is wrong with it?

11:21.247 --> 11:23.181
lt's a thought.

11:23.716 --> 11:25.013
Well, think about this.

11:25.084 --> 11:28.110
l don't want you to drive my car
l don't want you to ride in my car.

11:28.187 --> 11:30.849
l don't want you anywhere near my car!

11:32.058 --> 11:35.186
So, l suppose putting it on the rack
is out of the question.

11:39.398 --> 11:41.730
l'll fix my own dinner.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.598
[car horn honking]

11:49.709 --> 11:52.337
That's my carpool.
l should be back around 1 0:00.

11:52.411 --> 11:54.572
OK. l got everything under control here.

11:55.281 --> 11:58.182
<i>[thinking] She's leaving her keys
to the Healey.</i>

12:00.486 --> 12:02.613
Make sure the boys do their homework.

12:02.688 --> 12:05.521
- And don't try to help them.
- Don't worry about that.

12:07.026 --> 12:09.859
<i>I could just check it out.</i>

12:09.929 --> 12:12.090
<i>But I gotta have it back
before 10:00.</i>

12:12.631 --> 12:14.895
- You have a good time, OK?
- l will.

12:14.967 --> 12:17.697
<i>Oh, boy.
Oh, boy.</i>

12:17.770 --> 12:20.136
<i>Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.</i>

12:28.881 --> 12:30.849
<i>Oh, no.</i>

12:33.018 --> 12:35.043
<i>There's a new car in my garage.</i>

12:35.121 --> 12:38.887
<i>And I'm not allowed to drive it.
I'm in Tim Taylor hell.</i>

12:43.896 --> 12:45.989
<i>It does have
a nice looking body on this.</i>

12:46.065 --> 12:47.760
<i>Good curves.</i>

12:47.833 --> 12:51.792
<i>I've had a lot of vehicles in my time,
French, German, Italiano.</i>

12:53.773 --> 12:55.434
<i>But never British.</i>

12:58.144 --> 13:00.078
<i>Fits me like a glove.</i>

13:01.213 --> 13:04.546
<i>Nice feel on the clutch.
Short throw on the gearbox.</i>

13:04.617 --> 13:06.482
<i>I gotta drive this car.</i>

13:06.552 --> 13:09.077
<i>If I only had the keys.</i>

13:10.923 --> 13:12.823
<i>Then I wouldn't have to hotwire it.</i>

13:15.928 --> 13:17.657
<i>What am I talking about?</i>

13:17.730 --> 13:20.198
<i>What kind of guy hotwires
his wife's car?</i>

13:21.567 --> 13:23.262
<i>A guy like me.</i>

13:29.708 --> 13:31.073
What are you doing?

13:35.581 --> 13:37.515
l thought Mom said not to touch her car.

13:37.583 --> 13:39.312
She'll be glad l did.

13:39.385 --> 13:43.617
l'm just checking out the wire, making
sure there's no loose connections.

13:43.689 --> 13:46.055
You're hotwiring Mom's car, aren't you?

13:47.693 --> 13:49.456
l'm bypassing the ignition.

13:49.528 --> 13:53.658
What kind of a twisted human being
hotwires his wife's car?

13:54.333 --> 13:56.494
You guys are old enough
to know the truth.

13:56.602 --> 13:59.537
Your father is a sick, sick man.

14:01.874 --> 14:03.842
[engine starts]

14:08.247 --> 14:10.010
[tires squealing]

14:10.115 --> 14:11.946
<i>[Tim thinking] It handles great.</i>

14:12.017 --> 14:13.575
<i>Smooth acceleration.</i>

14:13.652 --> 14:15.381
<i>This is wonderful.</i>

14:17.656 --> 14:18.987
<i>This is fab.</i>

14:19.058 --> 14:21.424
<i>Blimey, I'm falling for a Brit.</i>

14:22.428 --> 14:26.194
<i>Just got to get this car home by 10:00
or I'm in big trouble with her mom.</i>

14:36.308 --> 14:39.334
<i>Why do they have to
do road construction tonight?</i>

14:41.914 --> 14:43.541
[horn honking]

14:44.683 --> 14:48.050
What are you honking at me for?
l'm not the one repaving the road?

14:48.153 --> 14:49.984
<i>[man] l love Tool Time.</i>

14:57.062 --> 14:58.359
[car door closes]

14:59.565 --> 15:01.533
[panting]

15:06.605 --> 15:09.301
- Nine fifty-nine. ls she back?
- Nope.

15:09.375 --> 15:13.038
- lt's your lucky night.
- Not your best hair night, however.

15:15.347 --> 15:17.212
Here she comes.
Act natural.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.407
Dad, your hair.

15:20.853 --> 15:23.788
- Hey, how was school?
- Long and boring.

15:23.856 --> 15:25.221
Why are you holding your head?

15:25.324 --> 15:28.555
Married to me for 1 7 years,
you're asking why l'm holding my head?

15:33.866 --> 15:35.424
Morning.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.932
You're making breakfast.

15:38.003 --> 15:39.732
Yeah.

15:39.805 --> 15:44.367
Your favorite, egg white omelet
with shiatsu mushrooms.

15:45.978 --> 15:48.105
l gotta say you're taking
this car thing well.

15:48.180 --> 15:50.705
l thought not driving the Healey
would make you crazy.

15:50.783 --> 15:53.650
Come on. Give me more credit than that.

15:55.287 --> 15:56.652
You don't want me driving it.

15:56.722 --> 15:59.623
l'm mature enough
to respect your wishes.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.125
Thank you.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.896
Hey, Mark, hand me the sports section.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.262
- Here you go.
- l don't believe it.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.267
Lions won?

16:24.817 --> 16:27.980
Does anybody have the Metro section?
l want to look at the weather.

16:28.087 --> 16:30.248
Uh, we didn't get one today.

16:32.291 --> 16:34.816
l'm predicting cold with patchy fog.

16:36.161 --> 16:39.062
We always get one.
lt's between classified and sports.

16:44.803 --> 16:46.668
But we didn't get one today, honey.

16:48.540 --> 16:50.405
[Tim] Oh, wow. What...

16:54.413 --> 16:56.244
Why are you hiding the paper?

16:56.315 --> 16:59.182
- l'm not hiding the paper.
- Yes, you are.

16:59.251 --> 17:02.084
l'm trying to protect you from
all the bad news in this world.

17:02.154 --> 17:04.645
- Oh, my God, it's you.
- A lovely picture, isn't it?

17:07.326 --> 17:09.351
You're in my car.

17:09.428 --> 17:11.396
But l had the keys.
How did you...?

17:12.263 --> 17:14.425
You hotwired my car?

17:17.202 --> 17:20.433
Mom, go easy on him.
He's a sick, sick man.

17:23.242 --> 17:24.800
Boys, out.

17:27.346 --> 17:28.870
Tim, in.

17:31.150 --> 17:33.880
You know, it...
Just settle down, would you please?

17:33.952 --> 17:37.251
lt possibly was bad judgment on my part
to borrow the car.

17:37.322 --> 17:39.688
You didn't borrow the car.
You stole the car.

17:39.792 --> 17:43.888
Stealing, borrowing... Wait,
that omelet is getting very cold.

17:43.962 --> 17:46.590
lf you were a stranger
l would have you arrested.

17:46.665 --> 17:49.566
Careful with that.
lt's a very good picture of me.

17:49.635 --> 17:51.967
Try pepper or salsa.
lt will make it zesty.

17:52.037 --> 17:55.700
Tim, this whole gift from my aunt
was supposed to be fun.

17:56.375 --> 17:58.275
But from the minute
l decided to buy a car,

17:58.343 --> 18:01.710
you have done nothing but suck the fun
out of the whole thing.

18:01.814 --> 18:04.180
Thank you for nothing!

18:05.884 --> 18:08.375
l could heat it up.
lt'll be as good as new.

18:12.491 --> 18:15.460
One day l'm gonna figure out
how to suck the leaves off the tree.

18:15.527 --> 18:16.824
[chuckling]

18:17.796 --> 18:20.822
- What are you doing over there?
- l'm providing sustenance

18:20.899 --> 18:23.333
<i>for my Annelida terra firma.</i>

18:23.402 --> 18:24.664
Huh?

18:25.471 --> 18:26.938
l'm feeding my worms.

18:27.005 --> 18:30.168
They like newspaper, huh?
Probably love the gardening section.

18:30.275 --> 18:33.642
Well, actually,
they seem to prefer the obituaries.

18:33.745 --> 18:35.679
[chuckling]

18:37.249 --> 18:38.978
Don't quit your day job.

18:41.186 --> 18:44.280
l'll be writing my obituary
if l can't patch things up with Jill.

18:44.356 --> 18:45.914
Uh-oh. What's wrong now?

18:46.024 --> 18:49.983
l promised her l wouldn't drive
her new Austin-Healey.

18:50.062 --> 18:54.328
W-Whoa. l thought l saw a picture of you
driving the Healey in the Metro section.

18:55.367 --> 18:57.597
So did she.

18:57.669 --> 19:00.695
l can't figure it out.
l get near her car, l take over.

19:00.772 --> 19:03.002
Uh-huh. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

19:03.075 --> 19:06.977
Same thing happened when Harry bought
his truck and Al bought his Gremlin.

19:07.045 --> 19:08.342
l love cars.

19:08.413 --> 19:11.143
Maybe you shouldn't love
other people's cars so much.

19:11.950 --> 19:13.315
That's my problem.

19:13.385 --> 19:15.444
l'm a man who loves too much.

19:17.856 --> 19:19.915
My love is hurting other people.

19:19.992 --> 19:24.361
So, l think you should apologize to all
the people you've wronged automotivally.

19:24.429 --> 19:26.363
That could take years.

19:26.431 --> 19:27.955
Start with Jill.

19:28.033 --> 19:30.001
That could take years.

19:37.309 --> 19:41.075
- Hi, how was school?
- Fine, but the drive was better.

19:42.347 --> 19:44.178
Can l talk to you for a minute?

19:44.249 --> 19:46.376
Tim, l'm really tired, honey.

19:46.451 --> 19:49.887
This is really important, please.
Just for a second. Come on.

19:54.126 --> 19:56.026
OK. What?

19:56.094 --> 19:57.254
Sit down.

19:57.329 --> 19:59.661
l didn't mean to steamroll you
and ruin your fun.

19:59.731 --> 20:02.291
The truth is, l have the problem.

20:03.402 --> 20:06.166
- l'm addicted to cars.
- Well, duh.

20:09.741 --> 20:14.235
l want to apologize for all the times
l've wronged you automotivally.

20:14.313 --> 20:16.076
That could take years.

20:17.049 --> 20:19.677
That's why we've got to start.
Just listen.

20:19.751 --> 20:20.911
All right.

20:21.019 --> 20:23.283
Your birthday, 1 975.

20:24.456 --> 20:28.017
Remember you wanted earrings?
l bought you that chrome dipstick.

20:29.027 --> 20:31.757
Valentine's Day, 1 976.

20:31.830 --> 20:35.197
You wanted earrings,
l got you a case of transmission fluid.

20:36.435 --> 20:38.266
Our wedding, 1 979.

20:38.337 --> 20:40.271
l insisted on the hot rod theme.

20:40.339 --> 20:44.070
Remember the three-barrel Stromberg
wedding cake? lt was a big hit.

20:44.142 --> 20:46.633
- Christmas, 1 980.
- Tim.

20:47.212 --> 20:49.237
How do you remember all these dates?

20:49.314 --> 20:51.009
lt's part of my car sickness.

20:55.454 --> 20:57.115
l need help.

20:58.223 --> 21:01.249
l'm thinking of checking in
to the Henry Ford Clinic.

21:09.968 --> 21:11.629
Here, just...

21:13.272 --> 21:15.832
- You bought me flowers.
- Well, not exactly.

21:19.411 --> 21:20.742
The Club?

21:32.190 --> 21:33.680
Ready to go to dinner?

21:33.759 --> 21:35.124
Yeah.

21:35.193 --> 21:37.218
- Wanna go in the Healey?
- Oh, yeah.

21:38.664 --> 21:40.529
Well, you've earned it.

21:40.599 --> 21:44.558
lt's been two weeks and you've stayed
away from my car without one relapse.

21:44.636 --> 21:45.796
lt wasn't easy.

21:45.871 --> 21:47.771
Every time l was tempted
l visualized

21:47.839 --> 21:50.774
Margaret Thatcher eating a kidney pie
in a thong.

21:56.114 --> 21:58.674
lt's a big night, the first time
l've ridden in this car

21:58.784 --> 22:00.945
without starting it with a screwdriver.

22:01.019 --> 22:02.782
- Shall we?
- We shall.

22:02.854 --> 22:04.321
Yes.

22:05.691 --> 22:07.158
Tim.

22:07.225 --> 22:09.659
l was opening the door for you, hon.

22:11.096 --> 22:12.461
Thank you.
