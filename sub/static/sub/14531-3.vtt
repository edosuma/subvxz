00:40.704 --> 00:44.917
[dialing phone, ringing]

00:45.001 --> 00:48.253
Marge? Hi, it's Grace.

00:48.337 --> 00:52.257
Listen, I can't do the silent auction.

00:52.341 --> 00:55.427
Because it's being sponsored
by the law firm.

00:56.553 --> 00:59.849
Well, because
Robert is divorcing me.

01:00.933 --> 01:03.186
Because he is a homosexual.

01:39.263 --> 01:40.597
[sighs]

01:41.431 --> 01:43.517
With Sol.

01:44.894 --> 01:46.645
Yes, that Sol.

01:48.397 --> 01:50.691
Yup, I guess so.

01:52.359 --> 01:55.029
Better go ahead and get that.
Okay.

01:55.112 --> 01:57.573
Yeah, bye, Marge, bye-bye.

01:58.574 --> 01:59.575
[sighs]

02:07.791 --> 02:09.293
[grunts]

02:23.057 --> 02:26.351
You wanna play the tough guy, huh?
That's how you wanna do it?

02:26.435 --> 02:30.355
Okay, I can wait.
I've got nowhere else to be.

02:31.440 --> 02:36.195
Well, jury duty,
but that's not till October.

02:36.279 --> 02:39.031
What's Mallory's food problem du jour?

02:39.115 --> 02:41.909
Her... gluten or meat?
I can't remember.

02:41.992 --> 02:44.745
Right. No. It's something ridiculous.
Corn, maybe?

02:44.828 --> 02:46.580
Nothing doesn't have corn.

02:46.663 --> 02:48.624
I have to rethink the whole dinner now.

02:48.707 --> 02:51.210
Sol, it's not till tomorrow.
We've got plenty of time.

02:51.294 --> 02:54.797
And it'll be fine. Our families
have had a million dinners together.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.506
The girls adore you.

02:56.590 --> 03:00.261
That was before they found out
I was going to be their new stepmother.

03:00.344 --> 03:03.472
Sol, you're making me nervous.

03:03.555 --> 03:07.143
Say, do you remember the way
Grace used to fold the napkins

03:07.226 --> 03:09.561
into bow-ties sometimes?
Do you know how she did that?

03:09.645 --> 03:12.564
- No idea.
- Oh.

03:12.648 --> 03:15.567
I should wash these
before we use them.

03:15.651 --> 03:18.362
You're using china?
We're going that fancy?

03:18.445 --> 03:21.490
I just think people are on their best
behavior when they eat off china.

03:21.573 --> 03:23.993
Clearly you've never raised boys.

03:26.411 --> 03:30.207
Oh, geez, Coyote. I forgot.

03:30.291 --> 03:33.669
- We haven't thought this through.
- We're thinking it through now.

03:33.752 --> 03:36.339
- There's something else we're forgetting.
- Sol, it's just a dinner.

03:36.421 --> 03:39.549
We might forget something. So what?
It's fine. They're gonna be fine.

03:39.633 --> 03:42.261
- We're gonna be fine.
- Oh, I know we're gonna be fine.

03:42.345 --> 03:45.389
Because I'm gonna open the bottle
of wine we're not serving to Coyote.

03:45.514 --> 03:47.183
Well, you're not gonna drink it alone.

03:48.267 --> 03:53.272
I love the dear silver
That shines in your hair

03:53.356 --> 03:58.443
And the brow that's all wrinkled
And furrowed with care

03:58.527 --> 03:59.611
I...

03:59.695 --> 04:03.949
I kiss the dear fingers
So toil-worn for me

04:04.033 --> 04:06.118
- Oh...
- Oh...

04:06.202 --> 04:09.246
God bless you and keep you

04:09.330 --> 04:12.875
- Mother Machree
- Mother Machree

04:29.975 --> 04:31.935
Do we have a poltergeist?

04:32.019 --> 04:34.438
Worse.
Nothing better to do.

04:34.521 --> 04:37.191
So what is it that you are doing?

04:37.274 --> 04:38.901
I'm trimming the rug.

04:38.984 --> 04:40.903
Because it grows so fast, huh?

04:40.986 --> 04:45.366
- Get your scissors away from my rug!
- Fine, fine.

04:45.449 --> 04:48.785
I'll go alphabetize the spices.

04:48.869 --> 04:51.288
No. They're in order
of how often we use them.

04:51.372 --> 04:53.457
Leave the allspice
in the back where it belongs.

04:53.540 --> 04:56.919
You know what?
I think your painting's calling you.

04:57.002 --> 04:59.880
No, it isn't.
We're not talking right now.

05:28.658 --> 05:30.119
Hey, where you going?

05:30.202 --> 05:32.704
I've made a monumental life decision.

05:32.788 --> 05:36.417
What? What's the matter
with the ignition?

05:36.500 --> 05:38.543
I've made a life decision.

05:38.627 --> 05:41.380
Oh, where are you going to go fishing?

05:41.464 --> 05:44.007
Listen, if you want to talk to me,
come in here.

05:46.051 --> 05:48.304
You have got to get
a hearing device.

05:48.387 --> 05:50.264
How do you expect me
to hear you when you're shouting

05:50.347 --> 05:52.849
from the other side of the house?
What were you saying?

05:52.933 --> 05:55.769
I am going back to work!

05:55.852 --> 05:57.687
Good. Where?

05:57.771 --> 05:59.482
To my company.

05:59.564 --> 06:01.233
The one you gave to Brianna?

06:01.317 --> 06:03.652
The one I built from nothing.

06:03.735 --> 06:06.571
- Okay, brava.
- Where's my phone?

06:06.655 --> 06:07.739
- Miss?
- Huh?

06:07.823 --> 06:09.199
Oh.

06:09.283 --> 06:12.035
So, where's Brianna going to work?

06:12.119 --> 06:14.621
You know what? I'm going to go.

06:14.704 --> 06:15.831
Oh, can I come with you?

06:17.291 --> 06:19.460
- Get your own job.
- I've got a job.

06:19.543 --> 06:21.795
Yeah. Teaching convicts.

06:21.878 --> 06:25.174
We call them
rehabilitated former offenders.

06:25.257 --> 06:28.511
This is what we're calling them now?
That's good to know.

06:32.055 --> 06:36.185
I like the idea of going fishing.
I don't like to kill the fish, though.

06:36.268 --> 06:38.437
I guess I could throw them back.

06:38.521 --> 06:43.192
But I don't have a boat.
My friend Todd has a boat.

06:43.275 --> 06:45.277
Where is Todd?

06:45.361 --> 06:47.654
Oh, right, he died.

06:47.737 --> 06:50.866
I should call his wife.
Where's my cell phone?

06:50.949 --> 06:53.952
I'll call it. What's my number?

06:55.329 --> 06:56.621
Should we tell Mom?

06:56.705 --> 06:59.500
Are you nuts?
It's just gonna make her feel bad.

06:59.583 --> 07:03.128
- I feel weird.
- It's all weird, Bud.

07:03.212 --> 07:08.258
Our father and his boyfriend
are having their children over for dinner.

07:08.342 --> 07:12.054
I can top that. The love of your
squandered life is gonna be there.

07:12.137 --> 07:15.224
- Probably with her husband.
- Shit!

07:15.307 --> 07:17.642
You do realize Coyote
is going to be there, right?

07:17.726 --> 07:20.437
Okay, I don't want to talk about Coyote.

07:20.521 --> 07:23.273
I know. I do, though. Is Mitch coming?

07:23.357 --> 07:25.859
No, my husband
will stay home with the kids

07:25.942 --> 07:28.070
when the babysitter suddenly gets sick.

07:28.153 --> 07:31.781
You know what, maybe I'll get sick, too.
Or maybe I'll just hang with Mom.

07:31.865 --> 07:36.119
If I'm going to this dinner, you're going.
And Mom can't know about this.

07:36.203 --> 07:40.416
If you breathe one word of this to Mom,
I will tell her who really killed Dimples.

07:40.499 --> 07:43.710
Will you stop throwing that
fucking hamster in my face!

07:43.793 --> 07:44.794
You don't have to go.

07:44.878 --> 07:49.007
I do have to go.
I have to talk to Mallory.

07:49.091 --> 07:53.011
And it's important for Dad.
And New Dad, Robert Dad.

07:53.095 --> 07:55.389
I smell a trigger. You gonna be okay?

07:55.472 --> 07:57.600
I'll even out by the third vodka.

07:57.682 --> 07:59.351
That's not funny yet.

08:04.231 --> 08:06.567
Just don't talk to Mom
for the next two days.

08:06.650 --> 08:07.692
Okay, what if she calls?

08:07.776 --> 08:10.737
If she calls,
don't lie like a pussy. Sell it.

08:10.820 --> 08:12.948
Wait. Is this one of those things
where you tell me not to tell her

08:13.031 --> 08:15.158
and then you get to tell her
and you get to be the hero?

08:16.159 --> 08:18.745
- Hi, Mom!
- Oh, my God, let me talk to her!

08:20.289 --> 08:21.665
This is different.

08:21.748 --> 08:23.459
Lovely.

08:23.542 --> 08:25.919
Have a seat.

08:34.344 --> 08:38.097
- So glad you stopped by.
- Yeah. Me, too.

08:38.181 --> 08:41.143
So... what's up?

08:41.226 --> 08:46.898
Well, I've been thinking a lot about it
lately, and I've come to apologize.

08:46.982 --> 08:50.152
Apology accepted. What did you do?

08:50.235 --> 08:52.737
I handed you this business
and I abandoned you.

08:52.821 --> 08:58.494
I took a competent, no-frills money
manager and thrust her into the rough

08:58.577 --> 09:00.496
and tumble world of beauty products.

09:00.579 --> 09:02.789
It's not exactly
the Thunderdome here, Mom.

09:02.872 --> 09:05.501
And you know,
we're up 15 percent this last quarter.

09:05.584 --> 09:09.630
That's wonderful, honey.
But here's what I'm thinking.

09:10.797 --> 09:12.174
I want to try to make it up to you

09:12.257 --> 09:15.427
by offering you something
you could really use.

09:15.511 --> 09:18.347
- A boyfriend who doesn't talk?
- No.

09:18.430 --> 09:23.101
Me. I would love
to come back to work here.

09:27.981 --> 09:30.900
- Oh...
- You'd still be CEO.

09:30.984 --> 09:33.278
But it just feels...

09:33.362 --> 09:35.947
like a natural fit for us,
doesn't it?

09:36.031 --> 09:39.576
Yeah. But you retired.
We had a party.

09:39.660 --> 09:42.871
There were shrimp cakes and speeches.
Margaret cried.

09:42.954 --> 09:47.792
- Do we have a problem here?
- Well, I mean, I don't know.

09:47.876 --> 09:51.087
We've gone in a different direction,
and that took capital.

09:51.171 --> 09:54.090
I don't know if I have the money
to hire someone else.

09:54.174 --> 09:56.635
Well, what do you mean,
"different direction"?

09:56.719 --> 10:00.263
Oh, gosh! I mean more...

10:02.849 --> 10:04.601
relevant.

10:04.685 --> 10:07.062
Are you implying I'm irrelevant?

10:07.145 --> 10:08.731
Because that would be interesting,

10:08.813 --> 10:11.400
given that my face
is all over the darn box.

10:11.483 --> 10:14.986
I know.
Um... only until the fall, though.

10:20.075 --> 10:22.994
You... you replaced
my face with a plant?

10:23.078 --> 10:25.038
Mm-hmm.

10:32.671 --> 10:34.214
Mmm.

10:38.552 --> 10:41.638
Mmm! [laughs]

10:41.722 --> 10:45.642
See, we're going for
a more youthful customer,

10:45.726 --> 10:48.228
and she's urban, and she's active,

10:48.311 --> 10:52.274
and she responds better
to a plant than a face.

10:52.357 --> 10:54.610
I've been erased.

10:54.693 --> 10:57.112
I'm sorry, Mom.
I should have told you.

11:01.324 --> 11:04.077
- Help me, damn it.
- I don't think I can...

11:04.160 --> 11:05.245
- No! Out of the chair!
- Oh.

11:07.956 --> 11:08.873
Here.

11:11.585 --> 11:12.711
Just...

11:15.714 --> 11:20.093
- This is what I know how to do.
- God, Mom. I know.

11:20.176 --> 11:22.387
- So?
- So... I can't.

11:22.471 --> 11:24.681
- I don't understand! Why not?!
- I can't, because...

11:26.642 --> 11:28.477
Because if you're here,
no one will see me.

11:29.603 --> 11:32.147
You're a big presence.
You cast a giant shadow.

11:32.230 --> 11:34.650
I could never come out
from underneath that.

11:35.651 --> 11:37.986
If you came back here,
I'd be completely invisible.

11:38.069 --> 11:40.071
I don't think you know
what that feels like.

11:41.990 --> 11:43.408
I think I'm beginning to.

11:44.909 --> 11:48.246
Well, would you at least let me
take you to dinner?

11:49.623 --> 11:52.835
I wish I could... I've got a thing.

11:52.917 --> 11:55.337
- A thing?
- Don't ask.

11:55.420 --> 11:59.174
FYI, childbirth was easier
than getting out of that chair.

12:00.592 --> 12:02.636
I personally prefer working in oils,

12:02.719 --> 12:05.514
although watercolors
are more forgiving as we age.

12:05.597 --> 12:09.893
Oh, yeah, yeah.
So, this is the dining room.

12:10.935 --> 12:16.232
Salad bars usually freak me out,
but this one seems sanitary.

12:16.316 --> 12:19.986
Well, you know, you're welcome to have
all your meals here if you like.

12:20.069 --> 12:23.948
We've got kosher options.
And... vegetarian.

12:24.032 --> 12:25.575
Is it that obvious?

12:25.659 --> 12:27.744
Your shoes.

12:27.828 --> 12:30.914
Oh, I do have my MFA.
An online MFA.

12:30.997 --> 12:34.543
- I'm a Phoenix.
- Oh. Good for you.

12:38.714 --> 12:41.966
- [line ringing]
- [cell phone chimes]

12:42.050 --> 12:43.552
Fuck.

12:44.969 --> 12:47.931
- Hello?
- Hi. Can you be nice to me?

12:48.014 --> 12:50.392
Um, okay...

12:50.475 --> 12:54.396
I love you. You're so pretty.
I gotta go.

12:54.479 --> 12:55.939
Mal...

12:57.566 --> 12:59.943
Am I irrelevant?

13:00.026 --> 13:02.237
[Mal] Oh, Mom.

13:02.320 --> 13:05.866
Not to me. I gotta go.

13:07.492 --> 13:09.578
Okay, bye.

13:10.704 --> 13:13.331
I like it here. This could work.

13:13.415 --> 13:15.542
Well, we would really like to have you.

13:15.625 --> 13:19.629
Really? Oh, God, that is fantastic!

13:19.713 --> 13:21.673
Oh, my God.

13:21.757 --> 13:24.384
Oh. Okay.

13:24.467 --> 13:27.804
So, William, let's get down
to brass tacks. How much?

13:27.888 --> 13:29.890
Well, it'll be ten thousand a month.

13:29.973 --> 13:31.224
To teach art!

13:31.307 --> 13:33.602
Art. Wait, art?

13:33.685 --> 13:36.396
You placed an ad for an art teacher.

13:36.479 --> 13:39.524
You're not Myrna Rosenblum, are you?

13:39.608 --> 13:43.653
I was supposed to give her
a new resident's tour at two o'clock.

13:43.737 --> 13:46.197
To live here? Oh, my God.

13:46.281 --> 13:49.367
Do I look like I need
a bed with a motor?

13:49.451 --> 13:52.579
Oh, well, people are taking
really good care of themselves these days.

13:52.662 --> 13:56.792
No, no, I have taken
terrible care of myself.

13:56.875 --> 14:00.796
I am young.
I'm... I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

14:00.879 --> 14:02.464
Excuse me.

14:04.007 --> 14:06.301
My joints are supple.

14:13.976 --> 14:15.143
[panting] The girls are here.

14:15.226 --> 14:17.854
I swear we're forgetting something.

14:20.398 --> 14:22.776
Anyway, here we go.

14:22.859 --> 14:24.486
Wait, wait, wait.

14:27.990 --> 14:30.074
Now here we go.

14:31.326 --> 14:32.368
Hey!

14:32.452 --> 14:34.203
What are you doing?

14:34.287 --> 14:37.666
I'm having dinner
with my gay dads, you?

14:37.749 --> 14:40.293
You can't just walk in there.
It's not your house anymore.

14:40.376 --> 14:43.546
I lost both of my virginities
in this house. It's my house.

14:44.547 --> 14:47.342
- Hi! Hi.
- Hi!

14:47.425 --> 14:48.844
Welcome.

14:49.928 --> 14:51.930
- Hi!
- Hello.

14:54.766 --> 14:56.601
Welcome?

14:56.685 --> 14:59.187
We're so glad you came.

15:01.397 --> 15:02.941
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:03.025 --> 15:04.526
Excuse me.

15:08.780 --> 15:10.448
I brought you chocolate.

15:10.532 --> 15:11.658
That's from both of us.

15:11.741 --> 15:14.202
How nice! Thank you!

15:14.285 --> 15:17.956
There's vodka inside,
have you guys had those?

15:18.040 --> 15:19.875
No.

15:19.958 --> 15:22.251
You wouldn't think chocolate
and vodka go well together,

15:22.335 --> 15:26.172
but it's like mac and cheese,
it just... it just works.

15:28.466 --> 15:29.467
[clears throat]

15:31.803 --> 15:34.180
Well, you both look great.

15:34.263 --> 15:37.475
Oh, no, I look like shit.
But thank you.

15:37.559 --> 15:38.643
Would you like something to drink?

15:38.727 --> 15:40.478
- Bourbon.
- Scotch, please.

15:40.562 --> 15:45.149
- No... we're not serving alcohol tonight.
- [Mal] Are you kidding?

15:50.488 --> 15:51.573
Knock, knock!

15:51.656 --> 15:53.575
- Hey.
- Hey, guys!

15:53.658 --> 15:55.493
Hello!

15:56.411 --> 15:58.246
Hey, Bud. Welcome.

15:58.329 --> 16:01.207
- Yeah.
- Hi, Dad. Hi...

16:01.290 --> 16:03.835
- Coyote. Welcome.
- Thank you.

16:05.128 --> 16:07.881
- Hi, Bree.
- What's up, Broseph?

16:07.964 --> 16:10.341
- That's what I'm gonna call you now.
- No, you are not.

16:10.425 --> 16:12.594
- Mm-hmm.
- Mal.

16:12.677 --> 16:14.888
Broseph.

16:14.971 --> 16:17.724
Who would like some
sparkling apple cider?

16:18.558 --> 16:20.685
Oh, geez, that's...
that's because of me.

16:20.769 --> 16:26.024
It's fine. Please, everyone drink, enjoy.

16:26.108 --> 16:28.484
See? Straight from the alcoholic's mouth.

16:28.568 --> 16:31.529
- He says it's fine.
- Thanks, Coyote, but it's okay.

16:31.613 --> 16:35.033
Everybody's needs
have been considered tonight.

16:35.117 --> 16:39.955
Mal, the bread crumbs are gluten-free.
You're special, too.

16:40.038 --> 16:41.831
[Coyote] Mal.

16:42.498 --> 16:43.750
Come here.

16:43.833 --> 16:45.376
No.

16:50.548 --> 16:52.842
- Mal...
- I am not engaging with you.

16:52.926 --> 16:55.137
- You're not engaging?
- No.

16:55.219 --> 16:58.098
Okay, I have no idea
what I did that night.

16:58.181 --> 16:59.975
- Are you kidding me?
- No!

17:00.058 --> 17:05.855
I was on a cocktail of tequila,
cocaine and non-stick cooking spray.

17:05.939 --> 17:08.691
- You guys, there's cheese.
- Just a second!

17:10.026 --> 17:12.945
Well, let me refresh your memory.

17:13.029 --> 17:18.367
After mowing down my mailbox,
you proceeded to get out of your car

17:18.451 --> 17:20.996
and start shouting
at the top of your lungs,

17:21.079 --> 17:23.414
"Mal, don't marry Mitch!

17:23.498 --> 17:26.041
It doesn't have to be me,
just don't marry Mitch!"

17:26.126 --> 17:28.920
Which manages to not only
scare my children,

17:29.004 --> 17:32.548
but really piss off my husband,
who, by the way,

17:32.632 --> 17:34.926
I had already been married to
for seven years.

17:35.010 --> 17:37.470
[sighs]

17:37.553 --> 17:39.681
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

17:40.932 --> 17:42.266
I had no idea.

17:44.519 --> 17:46.562
That's really, really bad.

17:49.024 --> 17:52.568
[Sol] Let's go, everybody!
Phones in the box.

17:52.652 --> 17:53.903
Phones.

17:53.987 --> 17:56.364
God, I thought you only did this
at your house.

17:56.447 --> 17:59.201
This is his house.

17:59.283 --> 18:01.327
I need a drink
or I need my phone.

18:01.410 --> 18:03.872
You have got to give me something.

18:03.955 --> 18:07.667
- We hid a bottle of Chianti...
- Behind the toaster.

18:07.750 --> 18:09.335
Good enough.

18:12.214 --> 18:13.422
Let's eat!

18:46.164 --> 18:48.666
[bottle clattering]

18:51.794 --> 18:53.046
[sighs]

18:57.133 --> 18:59.052
Did you steal my scissors?

18:59.135 --> 19:01.637
- Yes.
- Well, can I have 'em back?

19:01.721 --> 19:03.932
Will you stop trimming the rugs?

19:04.015 --> 19:05.975
Yes.

19:06.809 --> 19:09.520
- [Frankie sighs]
- That's not bad.

19:10.939 --> 19:12.315
What is it, an otter?

19:13.691 --> 19:16.278
It's my fucking day.

19:19.447 --> 19:21.824
Did you get your job back?

19:21.908 --> 19:26.913
No, no. I decided it's...
it's not me anymore.

19:39.175 --> 19:42.053
- [crickets chirping]
- [clock ticking]

19:51.938 --> 19:54.607
How did you get the almond
to actually stick to the chicken?

19:54.690 --> 19:56.985
Interesting. Egg whites!

19:57.068 --> 19:58.278
Hmm.

19:58.361 --> 20:00.696
There are eggs in this?

20:00.780 --> 20:03.366
You have a problem with the eggs
but not the chicken?

20:03.449 --> 20:06.535
- That's classic.
- [Sol] Just egg whites, no yolk.

20:06.619 --> 20:10.290
And then you just grind up the almonds
with a little paprika.

20:10.373 --> 20:12.292
He's like a magician in the kitchen.

20:16.754 --> 20:20.508
- Do you think it's dry?
- A little.

20:20.591 --> 20:22.718
[deep breath and exhale]

20:22.802 --> 20:24.887
I think it's perfect, babe.

20:33.771 --> 20:36.524
- What are you looking for?
- Nothing.

20:36.607 --> 20:39.944
If you're looking for those cigarettes,
I threw them out.

20:40.611 --> 20:44.032
Shit. I'd give my good knee
for a cigarette.

20:46.450 --> 20:51.914
Me, too. I haven't had a cigarette
since smoking was good for you.

20:54.376 --> 20:55.793
Shall we?

21:02.591 --> 21:07.096
Mallory, would you engage me
in the salt, please?

21:12.476 --> 21:14.312
Excuse me.

21:26.241 --> 21:27.367
Mallory.

21:27.450 --> 21:29.493
I cannot deal with all of this right now.

21:29.577 --> 21:32.080
I can't deal with that,
and I can't deal with you.

21:32.163 --> 21:35.917
And my mother has taken
every single Valium out of this house.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.419
I know.

21:37.501 --> 21:39.795
I want drugs, too.

21:39.879 --> 21:43.299
But we have to figure a way
to deal with all of this without that,

21:43.383 --> 21:45.551
and without storming out of the room.

21:45.634 --> 21:49.013
No, no, no, no, no. I cannot be taking
advice about all this from you right now.

21:49.097 --> 21:50.681
That-that-that can't be right.

21:50.765 --> 21:54.852
I'm-I'm afraid it is.
We're step-people now.

21:54.936 --> 21:56.187
No.

21:56.271 --> 22:00.233
I'm sorry, but we're blended.
We have to be civil.

22:00.316 --> 22:04.070
No, I don't. I just came here to pee.

22:04.153 --> 22:06.030
I didn't come here
to work anything out with you.

22:06.114 --> 22:10.993
So just... just let me go
so that I can pee. Please.

22:15.873 --> 22:18.209
I think it's going okay.

22:22.588 --> 22:24.466
Uh... you need help?

22:24.548 --> 22:26.509
- With what?
- With dessert.

22:26.592 --> 22:30.096
- Isn't that what you came in here to do?
- Oh, no. I am not doing that.

22:30.179 --> 22:32.181
I came in here
so I don't have to be out there.

22:32.265 --> 22:35.851
By the way, why would you bring dessert
in like seven different containers?

22:35.935 --> 22:38.020
Go to the grocery store
like a normal person.

22:38.104 --> 22:39.981
- Buy an Entenmann's.
- What's your problem?

22:40.064 --> 22:42.233
Nothing. It's just...

22:42.317 --> 22:45.861
Why are we talking about
the almond meal chicken in there?

22:45.945 --> 22:47.822
"Oh, that's how you get the almond
to stick to the chicken?"

22:47.905 --> 22:51.075
"Yeah, but you have to use egg whites."
"Oh, well, egg whites makes it okay

22:51.159 --> 22:53.577
that our mothers are home alone
and heartbroken."

22:53.661 --> 22:55.163
Everyone is just trying their best, Bree.

22:55.246 --> 22:57.039
Is that why you gave
that elaborate toast?

22:57.123 --> 22:58.624
- It was the Kiddush.
- Oh.

22:58.707 --> 23:00.335
What did you think
was going to happen tonight?

23:00.418 --> 23:02.003
I don't know,
but don't you think it's weird

23:02.086 --> 23:04.630
that no one is talking about this?

23:04.713 --> 23:07.967
It's like we have flashed forward
five years into the future

23:08.050 --> 23:10.428
and everybody's cool with Dad and Sol.

23:10.512 --> 23:13.348
- I am cool with it.
- Oh, really? You're cool with it?

23:13.431 --> 23:18.520
Would you be cool with it if they'd been
cheating with women for the last 20 years?

23:18.602 --> 23:20.313
[sighs]

23:20.396 --> 23:23.274
- I don't know.
- Please. There wouldn't be cake.

23:23.358 --> 23:26.735
There'd be blood or bullets.
Something.

23:26.819 --> 23:29.613
For sure, we wouldn't be
talking about the chicken.

23:29.697 --> 23:32.200
Do you think you're the only one
that's having a hard time?

23:32.283 --> 23:35.953
Up until a week ago I was under the
impression my parents loved each other.

23:36.037 --> 23:37.455
Now I'm losing my family.

23:37.539 --> 23:43.419
I'm losing Jewish Christmas Eve,
and picketing Walmart, and camping.

23:45.629 --> 23:48.049
Forgot you guys all liked each other.

23:48.132 --> 23:50.759
Well, we had to.
We slept in a four person sleeping bag.

23:50.843 --> 23:53.137
- Really?
- No.

23:53.221 --> 23:56.182
I'll carry the cake.
Will you carry the coffee?

23:56.265 --> 23:59.018
- No.
- Thanks.

24:02.313 --> 24:05.316
Hey! Sir? Sir!
We're still waiting.

24:05.400 --> 24:07.026
Cigarettes!

24:09.362 --> 24:12.865
Oh, excuse me...
Hey, excuse me, excuse me!

24:12.948 --> 24:15.410
Damn it to hell. Oh, excuse me.

24:15.493 --> 24:16.911
I don't work here.

24:16.994 --> 24:19.080
But how do I get you fired?

24:24.627 --> 24:26.379
This is Mom's favorite.

24:29.507 --> 24:32.176
You remember Mom, right?

24:34.053 --> 24:36.931
I remember my mom.
She used to live here.

24:37.014 --> 24:39.392
- Enough, Brianna.
- [Sol] No, it's okay.

24:39.475 --> 24:41.603
Clearly, they need to express something.

24:41.685 --> 24:43.729
Are your mothers upset
that you came over?

24:43.812 --> 24:45.773
My mother doesn't know I'm here.

24:45.856 --> 24:48.067
I told her I had a thing
and I couldn't talk.

24:48.150 --> 24:51.987
- I'm at an AA meeting.
- I'm racked with guilt.

24:52.071 --> 24:54.031
Why wouldn't you tell them
you were coming here?

24:54.115 --> 24:57.118
- Are you really asking that?
- Yes! I am.

24:57.201 --> 24:59.245
They're going to find out you came here
and they're going to think

24:59.328 --> 25:02.915
we told you not to tell them,
and they'll assume you're taking our side.

25:02.998 --> 25:07.378
I'm sorry, is there some kind of manual
that we didn't get that tells us

25:07.462 --> 25:08.754
how to act in this situation?

25:08.837 --> 25:11.299
Because you two seem to be
the only ones who know the rules.

25:11.382 --> 25:13.008
We just think you
should have been honest.

25:13.092 --> 25:16.095
[laughing] I'm sorry,
are you trying to be ironic?

25:16.178 --> 25:17.805
[Sol] No. I'm trying to be your father!

25:17.888 --> 25:21.350
You don't have to point out to me
that I hurt your mother!

25:21.434 --> 25:25.146
I know she's been hurt.
Lying only makes it worse.

25:25.229 --> 25:27.231
- They've been through enough.
- Because of you!

25:29.066 --> 25:32.570
I lied to my mother for the first time
in my adult life because of you

25:32.654 --> 25:35.406
- and I'm not even allowed to be mad.
- Why not?

25:35.490 --> 25:36.865
'Cause you're gay!

25:36.949 --> 25:39.785
If you had been fucking around
with women for the last 20 years,

25:39.868 --> 25:42.330
we wouldn't even be here eating cake!

25:43.414 --> 25:44.999
Say it in there, and it comes out here.

25:48.336 --> 25:51.172
So we are not eating cake.

26:04.768 --> 26:08.481
Brianna, would you pass the cream, please?

26:13.486 --> 26:15.279
Thank you, Mallory.

26:15.363 --> 26:16.698
You're welcome, Coyote.

26:19.200 --> 26:22.328
Okay, stand back,
I'm about to lose my shit.

26:22.411 --> 26:27.291
Sir, can we get some cigarettes
over here, for crying out loud?!

26:27.375 --> 26:29.960
Oh, God, thank you!

26:30.044 --> 26:33.130
- Sir! Hi!
- Hi! How are you?

26:33.214 --> 26:35.090
[woman] I'm good...

26:35.174 --> 26:37.051
- Excuse me!
- It's a beautiful night.

26:37.134 --> 26:38.636
It is. Can I help you?

26:38.720 --> 26:41.847
Excuse me, are you in a coma?!

26:41.930 --> 26:44.684
This is a place of business, right?

26:44.767 --> 26:48.563
- Do you have lottery tickets?
- Sure do. How many?

26:48.646 --> 26:52.358
- Just two, please.
- You! You! Sir!

26:52.441 --> 26:54.569
- You!
- Just a second.

26:54.652 --> 26:57.238
- Just two of the scratch-offs?
- Yeah, scratch-offs.

26:57.321 --> 26:59.615
Hello!

26:59.699 --> 27:04.453
Hello! Hello!

27:04.537 --> 27:07.081
What kind of animal treats
people like this?!

27:08.082 --> 27:12.461
Do you not see me?! Do I not exist?!

27:12.545 --> 27:14.463
You think it's all right to ignore us?!

27:14.547 --> 27:17.925
- Just because she's got grey hair?
- What?

27:18.008 --> 27:19.594
And I don't look like her?

27:20.928 --> 27:23.639
This poor woman
needs a pack of cigarettes

27:23.723 --> 27:25.683
and she doesn't have
a lot of time left!

27:25.767 --> 27:28.686
- Get us a pack of cigarettes!
- Come on, let's get out of here, Grace.

27:28.770 --> 27:31.313
- Come on. Let's go!
- [grunts]

27:31.397 --> 27:34.024
- No!
- For God's sake! This way.

27:34.108 --> 27:36.151
- [Grace groans]
- [Frankie laughs]

27:37.861 --> 27:42.408
[panting]
Okay. That lacked poise and I'm sorry.

27:43.743 --> 27:47.246
But I refuse to be irrelevant.

27:48.790 --> 27:52.084
It's okay. I learned something.
We've got a superpower.

27:52.167 --> 27:53.252
You stole those?!

27:53.335 --> 27:55.630
You can't see me,
you can't stop me.

27:57.381 --> 27:58.758
Mmm.

28:04.346 --> 28:05.931
[Frankie] Peel out, baby!

28:06.014 --> 28:07.725
[tires screech]

28:08.851 --> 28:11.353
- Wanna hit Citibank?
- [Grace laughs]

28:17.151 --> 28:20.112
I knew we forgot something.

28:20.195 --> 28:22.740
We forgot it was too soon.

28:27.369 --> 28:30.623
I didn't hit a skunk.
It was a black and white bucket.

28:30.706 --> 28:32.458
Then what was that smell?

28:34.585 --> 28:36.738
What the heck is this?

28:36.773 --> 28:37.914
_

28:40.800 --> 28:42.009
I can't read it.

28:42.092 --> 28:45.596
You can eat it. It's a cake.
It won't kill you.
