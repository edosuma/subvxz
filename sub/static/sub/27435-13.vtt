Yes, Sir?

00:03.600 --> 00:05.022
They need help
in the back room.

00:05.100 --> 00:06.897
More servers.
At least one. Maybe two.

00:06.970 --> 00:08.335
Yes, sir,
Mr. Reddington.

00:08.400 --> 00:10.231
And, also, let's open
another couple of cases
of the Reserva.

00:12.710 --> 00:13.972

I don't care if
they're drinking milk...

00:15.380 --> 00:16.574
I don't want an empty glass
out there.

Mr. Reddington.

00:17.950 --> 00:19.918
And, Mr. Reddington,
it's good to have
you back, sir.

Wonderful party, Red.

00:30.360 --> 00:33.955
Not nearly as wonderful
as your daughter's
beautiful wedding in Berlin.

He couldn't make it.
Thank goodness.

Think you could
introduce me to Sidney?
Funny thing, that.

01:10.200 --> 01:12.498
She asked me to
introduce her to you.

The headaches,
the forgetfulness,
the confusion...

02:57.970 --> 03:02.578
It's all symptomatic
of something called
vascular dementia.

I don't know that
they're happening.

But they are, and
each one causes damage.

03:13.660 --> 03:15.287
I'm glad you resigned.
That gives us the time

03:15.360 --> 03:16.884
to get you the treatment
that you need.

Let's just stick to one major
life decision at a time.

03:22.800 --> 03:24.165
We have to talk
about this.

03:24.230 --> 03:26.937
And we will.
After you get better.

03:35.910 --> 03:38.549
No bargaining, no depression.
Can you do that for me?

03:41.520 --> 03:43.283
No.

03:43.350 --> 03:45.910
Okay, then please
promise me this.

03:45.990 --> 03:47.412
Don't tell anyone
about my condition.

03:47.490 --> 03:48.809
I don't want them to know.

03:49.590 --> 03:51.353
Of course.

03:51.430 --> 03:53.057
That I can do.

REDDINGTON: Walt Whitman
lived in a boarding house

03:59.500 --> 04:01.991
at this address
during the Civil War.

04:02.070 --> 04:04.800
Did you know he was
an ardent prohibitionist?

04:04.870 --> 04:07.430
Imagine that,
a sober poet.

04:07.510 --> 04:09.102
(SLURPS) Mmm!

04:09.180 --> 04:11.842
Have I ever told you
about my mentor?

04:11.910 --> 04:15.539
You mean, somebody
actually taught you
how to drink this early?

04:15.620 --> 04:17.884
Is it early?
I thought it was late.

04:17.950 --> 04:19.315
Robert Vesco.

04:19.390 --> 04:21.813
Robert took me
under his wing.

04:21.890 --> 04:24.279
He taught me how
to be a fugitive.

04:24.360 --> 04:27.955
I trusted him with my life,
and my life's savings.

04:28.030 --> 04:31.022
Which he convinced me
to Invest

04:31.100 --> 04:34.695
in_a cattle ranch
In Paraguay.

04:34.770 --> 04:37.898
Or so I thought,
until I went down there

04:37.970 --> 04:39.631
_ and found out
It was a whorehouse

04:39.710 --> 04:41.405
just outside of Asuncion.

04:41.480 --> 04:43.402
He conned you.
Out of everything.

04:43.480 --> 04:46.347
I got my ﬁrst taste
for vengeance,

04:46.420 --> 04:48.718
which I was never
able to satisfy.

04:48.780 --> 04:49.883
Why not?

04:49.950 --> 04:52.453
Becaus_e Vesco
up and died on me.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.087
Robert Vesco
was a central player

04:55.160 --> 04:58.721
in American financial
and political scandals
in the 19705.

04:58.790 --> 05:01.588
In 1971, the SEC accused Vesco

05:01.660 --> 05:05.824
of looting $200 million out of
a mutual fund he controlled.

05:05.900 --> 05:09.336
And a year later,
Vesco made an illegal
campaign contribution

05:09.410 --> 05:11.002
to Richard Nixon,

05:11.070 --> 05:13.868
hoping that Nixon's
attorney general
would let him off the hook.

05:13.940 --> 05:16.101
And when he didn't,
Vesco fled the country,

05:16.180 --> 05:19.172
living the rest of his life in
glamorous exile in Costa Rica,

05:19.250 --> 05:21.070
Nicaragua, The Bahamas,
and Cuba,

05:21.150 --> 05:23.380
where he reportedly died
in 2007.

05:23.450 --> 05:25.543
Reportedly?
When Reddington
was in prison,

05:25.620 --> 05:27.053
he heard a rumor
that Vesco

05:27.120 --> 05:29.111
faked his death
to avoid capture.

05:29.190 --> 05:32.250
Does he have any proof?
He sent Dembe to Havana
to dig up his grave.

05:32.330 --> 05:33.558
He asked me
to have the ME.

05:33.630 --> 05:35.120
run the DNA on the remains
he unearthed.

05:35.200 --> 05:37.065
COOPER: There was a time
when the Bureau was actively

05:37.130 --> 05:38.927
hunting for Vesco,
but we're not anymore.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.297
If he did fake his death,

05:40.370 --> 05:42.702
I doubt it was
to avoid capture.
Reddington agrees.

05:42.770 --> 05:44.863
He thinks Vesco
found the De La Cruz,

05:44.940 --> 05:46.931
a Spanish Ship
filled with gold

05:47.010 --> 05:49.604
that sank off the coast
of Florida in the 17005.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.944
Vesco always told him that
if he found that treasure,

05:52.010 --> 05:53.546
that he would
disappear forever.

05:53.620 --> 05:55.440
Does Mr. Reddington
know him?
Know him?

05:55.520 --> 05:57.545
Vesco was Reddington's
mentor,

05:57.620 --> 05:59.815
until he swindled him
out of every penny he had

05:59.890 --> 06:02.154
and left him high and dry
in a whorehouse in Paraguay.

06:02.220 --> 06:04.324
I like this guy already.
COOPER: In the last 50 years,

06:04.390 --> 06:06.119
there have been two truly
mythic fugitives...

06:06.190 --> 06:07.896
Robert Vesco
and Raymond Reddington.

06:07.960 --> 06:10.463
If one can help us get
the other, I'm all for it.

06:10.530 --> 06:13.397
Ressler, Keen, find out
where the ME. is at
with the remains.

06:13.470 --> 06:16.564
Before you do that,
I want you to know
that I'm resigning.

06:16.640 --> 06:17.732
You're leaving?

06:17.810 --> 06:19.004
For what? The Mossad?

06:21.740 --> 06:22.900
COOPER:
Which reminds me...

06:22.980 --> 06:24.402
They've called to schedule
an exit interview.

06:25.510 --> 06:27.114
I know I speak for everyone
when I say

06:27.180 --> 06:29.614
we'll miss you
and we're happy for you.

06:29.690 --> 06:30.816
Thank you.

06:33.390 --> 06:36.848
Pop quiz... Guess who's
buried in Vesco's grave.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.921
So it's not Vesco?
No.

06:38.990 --> 06:40.651
His name was
Anderson Mount.

06:40.730 --> 06:43.119
Who's that?
Run-of—the-mill goon.

06:43.200 --> 06:44.690
His greatest hits.

06:44.770 --> 06:46.692
Did enough damage
to get into CODIS.

06:46.770 --> 06:48.988
And when we put
the DNA from the body

06:49.070 --> 06:50.662
into the system,
we got a match.

06:50.740 --> 06:52.298
RESSLER: Thanks, Doc.

06:52.370 --> 06:54.270
So, if Mount's
in Vesco's grave,

06:54.340 --> 06:56.035
maybe Vesco's
in Mount's life.

06:56.110 --> 06:59.341
It says in his file, Mount
was in Truro, Nova Scotia.

06:59.410 --> 07:00.513
If you want to
get off the grid,

07:00.580 --> 07:01.979
you can't get much
further than that.

07:02.050 --> 07:03.688
Looks like we're going
to Nova Scotia.

07:03.750 --> 07:06.787
In the middle of winter.
Come on.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.509
We're gonna need
warmer clothes.

07:13.730 --> 07:15.152

07:15.230 --> 07:17.118
Levi.
It's good to see you.

07:17.200 --> 07:19.168
I hear congratulations
are in order.

07:19.230 --> 07:21.630
Yeah. Can you believe it?
I'm engaged.

07:23.310 --> 07:25.164
Um, this is Dr. Sands.

07:25.240 --> 07:27.208
He will administer
the polygraph.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.907
Is this
really necessary?

07:28.980 --> 07:30.299
It's protocol.
You know that.

07:31.250 --> 07:33.070
Let me guess,
Tel Aviv regrets

07:33.150 --> 07:34.515
having loaned me out
to the FBI.

07:34.580 --> 07:36.480
They think my allegiances
have shifted.

07:36.550 --> 07:38.142
You have level-four
clearance.

07:38.220 --> 07:40.415
They want to make sure
I've kept what I know
from the Americans.

07:40.490 --> 07:44.028
Or Reddington. Hey.
I'm just the messenger.

07:44.090 --> 07:45.489
Yeah, and the message
I'm getting is that

07:45.560 --> 07:47.050
you think I have
something to hide.

07:50.930 --> 07:53.262
LIZ: So much _for
glamorous eXIle.

07:53.340 --> 07:54.739
I don't get it.
Why would Vesco

07:54.800 --> 07:58.361
fake his death so he could
live here of all places?

07:58.440 --> 08:00.499
I think we need to get
the local police involved.

08:00.580 --> 08:02.741
We talked about this.
Reddington said
a guy like Vesco

08:02.810 --> 08:05.404
would have every cop
in town on payroll.
We go to them,

08:05.480 --> 08:06.947
they tell Vesco,
and he slips away.

08:09.080 --> 08:12.243

08:12.320 --> 08:15.255
DR. SANDS: Have you
provided any classified
information to the FBI?

SAMAR: No.
Were you loyal to
the state of Israel?

08:18.090 --> 08:19.955
Yes.
Have you broken any laws

Yes.

from your Mossad handlers?
Yes.

Yes.

Have you Shared it

0.

Is this personal

Yes.

Yes.

08:49.360 --> 08:52.158
Vesco, or whatever
he's calling himself,

08:52.230 --> 08:54.755
he would have the resources
to go anywhere he wanted to,

08:54.830 --> 08:56.593
create any life.
(KE'I'I'LE WHISTLING)

08:56.670 --> 08:58.558

it's personal.

all the questions you want
once we find him.

09:02.240 --> 09:03.639
First, we got to
clear those kids.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.769
Something about this guy,
what Reddington told us,

09:05.840 --> 09:07.205
it doesn't add up.

11:01.990 --> 11:03.628
You were my mentor.

11:03.690 --> 11:07.251
And I was mentoring you in
survival, in being selfish.

11:07.330 --> 11:08.695
And looking out
for yourself.

11:08.760 --> 11:11.194
Robert. My money.

11:11.270 --> 11:13.465
You think I'd be living
in Nova Scotia if I had it?

11:13.540 --> 11:14.962
I know why
you're living there.

11:15.040 --> 11:17.531
You found the De La Cruz.

11:17.610 --> 11:19.339
The treasure.
Where is it?

11:21.180 --> 11:24.638
If it's real, I believe
I know where it is.

11:25.880 --> 11:27.438
I never went after it.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.284
Oh, I wanted to,
but enemies were circling.

11:30.350 --> 11:31.647
I had to flee.

11:33.390 --> 11:36.314
So I staged my own death
and I fled the country.

11:38.530 --> 11:40.418
And by the time
the dust had settled,

11:40.500 --> 11:44.129
I... I realized
that I had changed.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.088
"Changed."
I'd lost the itch.

11:46.170 --> 11:47.239
I walked away.

11:47.300 --> 11:49.734
Being forced to lie low
and live the simple life

11:49.810 --> 11:51.732
was the best thing that
could've happened to me.

11:51.810 --> 11:55.132
I-It forced me to turn
the world off
and to tune into myself.

11:55.210 --> 11:57.576
Oh, my God.
I have my cat.

11:57.650 --> 11:59.572
I have plenty of
glorious books.

11:59.650 --> 12:02.915

I won't be conned again.

12:02.990 --> 12:05.515
Untether yourself from
social expectations

12:05.590 --> 12:09.151
and this destructive life of
crime and... And look inward.

12:09.220 --> 12:12.257
I'm happy to.

but... (SIGHS)

12:16.600 --> 12:18.158
It won't give you
inner peace.

12:18.230 --> 12:20.790
I already have
inner peace.

12:20.870 --> 12:22.690
What I could use
IS a new yacht.

12:22.770 --> 12:24.931
The last one was seized
In Mallorca.

12:25.010 --> 12:28.173
All right, I believe
the gold is buried

12:28.240 --> 12:32.142
under the Old French
Opera House
in New Orleans.

12:32.210 --> 12:33.643
I can prove it to you,

12:33.720 --> 12:35.813
but we'll have to
reroute the jet.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.984
To where?
Washington.

12:38.050 --> 12:43.226
There isn't a treasure map,
_ but there is a clue trail
In the LIbrary of Congress.

12:43.290 --> 12:45.155
Robert, if you're lying,

12:45.230 --> 12:48.791
I will shatter your serenity
by burning your home,

12:48.860 --> 12:52.023
drowning your cat,
and cutting off your big toes.

12:52.100 --> 12:54.239
You wouldn't dare
drown my cat.

12:54.300 --> 12:55.892
(CHUCKLES) Maybe not.

12:55.970 --> 12:58.200
But I will take the toes.

ARAM: How'd it go?

13:04.950 --> 13:06.542
They sent Levi.

13:06.610 --> 13:08.419
A friendly face
to put me at ease

13:08.480 --> 13:09.913
while they administered
a polygraph.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.015
They gave you
a polygraph? Why?

13:12.090 --> 13:14.251
To make I wasn't leaving
because I'd been turned.

13:14.320 --> 13:16.083
That's ridiculous.
And insulting.

13:16.160 --> 13:18.253
Listen, Aram, I meant
what I said earlier

13:18.330 --> 13:19.854
about having children.
We need to talk about it.

13:19.930 --> 13:21.659
I can't believe they think
that you could be a traitor.

13:21.730 --> 13:23.368
Aram, it doesn't matter.
Listen to me. Listen to me.

13:23.430 --> 13:24.567
You know, we Should tell
Mr. Cooper,

13:24.630 --> 13:25.927
and he'll strengthen
them right out.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.069
It doesn't matter
what they think.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.266
What matters is us,
our future,

13:28.340 --> 13:29.864
whether or not _
we can have a famIIy.

13:29.940 --> 13:31.737
Why? Why is that so urgent
that it cannot wait

13:31.810 --> 13:33.835
until you get help,
or convince Levi

13:33.910 --> 13:35.878
that you didn't dump him
to join Hamas?

13:35.940 --> 13:38.204
He does know that I'm, like,
a quarter Jewish, right?

13:38.280 --> 13:40.942
Reddington screwed us.
Took Vesco for himself.

13:43.090 --> 13:45.217
He knew Vesco would have
the local cops In hIs pocket,

13:45.290 --> 13:47.053
so he tipped them off
that we were there.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.553
So he gets his revenge.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.679
Yesterday the world
thought Vesco was dead.

13:50.760 --> 13:52.022
By tomorrow, he will be.

13:52.090 --> 13:55.127
Reddington wants
more than revenge.
He wants treasure.

13:55.200 --> 13:57.521
The De La Cruz? Reddington
said Vesco already found it.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.261
Well, judging by
his modest apartment,

13:59.330 --> 14:02.094
I'd say that if he knew where
it was, he never found it.

14:02.170 --> 14:07.403
Reddington called us from his
jet to give a gloating apology
and to say the hunt was on.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.539
Then let's join in.
If we solve the mystery,

14:09.610 --> 14:12.909
maybe we can
get to the treasure
first and arrest Vesco.

14:12.980 --> 14:16.245
REDDINGTON: Robert,
I appreciate that your
love of literature

14:16.320 --> 14:18.379
is almost as keen as mine,

14:18.450 --> 14:21.283
but why on Earth are we
in the Library of Congress?

14:21.360 --> 14:25.785
Uh, you want to know
how I decoded the myth
and located my white whale?

14:27.000 --> 14:29.560
The answer is in the poem.

14:29.630 --> 14:31.894
"The Ballad
of the De La Cruz."

14:31.970 --> 14:33.494
It was written
under a pseudonym.

14:33.570 --> 14:35.435
The author is a mystery,
but when Reddington

14:35.500 --> 14:36.967
gave us this case,
he said this poem

14:37.040 --> 14:39.406
somehow holds the key to
where the gold was hidden.

14:39.470 --> 14:42.177
The poem is an
opera Singer's lament

14:42.240 --> 14:45.004
about a Spanish Ship
bringing silver and gold

14:45.080 --> 14:47.571
to the American colonies
durIng the RevolutIon.

14:47.650 --> 14:51.017
But the ship sank
in a storm somewhere
along the East Coast,

14:51.090 --> 14:53.581
killing over 120 men aboard

14:53.660 --> 14:57.027
and sending over
half a ton of gold
and treasure into the deep.

14:57.090 --> 14:58.978
RESSLER: We had the NSA
run the text

14:59.060 --> 15:01.199
through decryption and
steganography programs.

15:01.260 --> 15:02.625
They came up empty.

15:02.700 --> 15:04.691
If there's a secret
hidden in that text,

15:04.770 --> 15:07.091
they couldn't find it.
SAMAR: Maybe it's
in the subtext.

15:07.170 --> 15:09.195
Storms. Marauders.
Dates and times.

15:09.270 --> 15:11.306
Who'd know about that?
The Naval College?

15:11.370 --> 15:12.530
The Library of Congress.

15:12.610 --> 15:13.975
They have more
primary source material

15:14.040 --> 15:15.371
than any library
in the world.

15:15.440 --> 15:18.773
COOPER: Keen, Ressler.
Get there. Decode the poem.

15:18.850 --> 15:21.410
Samar, Aram, you're on
Reddington. I want him found.

15:22.950 --> 15:25.839
According to the poem,
the De La Cruz sank

15:25.920 --> 15:28.184
the spring of 1778.

15:28.260 --> 15:31.684
But there's no record
of any storm bIg enough

15:31.760 --> 15:33.728
to take down a galleon
of that Size.

15:33.800 --> 15:38.669
So I started thinking...
What if it never sank?

15:38.730 --> 15:39.958
What if the "storm"

15:40.040 --> 15:41.894
that presumably destroyed
the De La Cruz

15:41.970 --> 15:44.666
was actually
a metaphor...

15:44.740 --> 15:46.970
For something else
catastrophic.

15:47.040 --> 15:48.302
Or someone.

15:49.610 --> 15:52.147
It didn't Sink.
It was taken.

15:53.280 --> 15:55.077
**

15:55.150 --> 15:59.041
The De La Cruz was
headed to Philadelphia.

15:59.120 --> 16:01.987
The route from southern waters
would take It rIght past

16:02.060 --> 16:04.187
what used to be known
as Hell's Gate,

16:04.260 --> 16:06.990
an area known _to be
frequented by pIrates.

16:07.060 --> 16:08.391
Uh-huh.

16:08.460 --> 16:11.224
Enter Ernesto Hidalgo.

16:11.300 --> 16:12.824
Criminal. Cheat.

16:12.900 --> 16:14.765
Pirate. Drunk.

16:14.840 --> 16:16.933
He and his men dominated
that area at the time.

16:17.010 --> 16:19.706
How can you be sure
he was the one
who took the galleon?

16:19.770 --> 16:22.330
Because Hidalgo
and his men

16:22.410 --> 16:28.519
were in all the papers
in the months before May 1778.

16:28.580 --> 16:31.287
But afterwards? Nothing.

16:31.350 --> 16:33.557
He took the treasure
and he fled inland.

16:33.620 --> 16:36.953
Naval records indicated
the Naw hunted them down,

16:37.030 --> 16:41.899
killing Hidalgo and his entire
crew near New Orleans.

16:41.960 --> 16:44.428
But there's no mention of
any recovered treasure.

16:44.500 --> 16:47.731
Hidalgo hid it somewhere
before he died.

16:47.800 --> 16:49.768
The question is where.

16:49.840 --> 16:51.865
Enter Judith Snell,

16:51.940 --> 16:53.976
one of_the most famous
opera SIngers of her tIme.

16:54.040 --> 16:55.598
Heh. Just like the poem.

16:55.680 --> 16:57.898
Apparently, Judith liked to
hang around with the bad boys.

16:57.980 --> 17:00.244
And the papers of the day
were full of her exploits

17:00.320 --> 17:03.881
with any number
of rogues and scoundrels,
Hidalgo being one.

17:03.950 --> 17:07.078
And I believe that he gave her
the task of hiding the bounty

17:07.160 --> 17:09.788
in a place where nobody
would dare look,

17:09.860 --> 17:13.523
her dressing room in the
opera house in New Orleans...

17:14.400 --> 17:16.823
Which later burned
to the ground,

17:16.900 --> 17:18.788
killing her and 28 others.

17:18.870 --> 17:22.795
My theory?
Whatever remains of
Judith Snell's dressing room

17:22.870 --> 17:27.500
is located here,
directly under the stage
of the new opera house,

17:27.580 --> 17:29.935
which was built
on the remains of the old one.

17:30.010 --> 17:32.103
If the treasure's real,
it's there.

17:34.180 --> 17:35.909
What a tale.

17:35.980 --> 17:37.311
An opera.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.585
A romance with pirates.

17:39.650 --> 17:41.914
A fire.
Shipwrecks and gold.

17:41.990 --> 17:44.686
Just the sort of thing
that gets me out of bed
in the morning.

17:44.760 --> 17:47.092
It won't make you happy, Ray.
It won't make you whole.

17:47.160 --> 17:48.650
Oh, but you're wrong.

17:48.730 --> 17:51.858
It will make me happy.
Very.

17:51.930 --> 17:55.593
Dembe, phone Ruddiger.
Tell him to sober up.

17:55.670 --> 17:57.399
We're gonna rob the opera.

18:04.050 --> 18:06.701
Hi. Agents Keen
and Ressler, FBI.

18:06.780 --> 18:09.578
How can I help you?
We got a poem
we're looking for.

18:09.650 --> 18:11.345
We think it may be some
sort of treasure map.

18:11.420 --> 18:14.150
I know that sounds crazy...
"The Ballad
of the De La Cruz."

18:14.220 --> 18:15.881
How could you
possibly know that?

18:15.960 --> 18:17.928
Because you're not
the first people
who've asked me about it.

18:17.990 --> 18:19.218
Two old white guys.

18:19.290 --> 18:21.053
And an African-American
gentlemen.

18:21.130 --> 18:22.688
We need to see whatever
they looked at.

18:22.760 --> 18:24.864
Whatever you gave them,
you need to get for us
right now.

18:26.100 --> 18:27.692
**

18:27.770 --> 18:29.897
VESCO: To access the treasure,
we need to get inside

18:29.970 --> 18:31.801
Judith Snell's
old dressing room,

18:31.870 --> 18:34.509
which is located here,
under the stage.

18:34.580 --> 18:37.708
Now, the only way to get to
that room is through here,

18:37.780 --> 18:39.372
the south wall
of the basement,

18:39.450 --> 18:42.908
and we would
need that explosion
to be timed precisely

18:42.980 --> 18:45.187
so the audience doesn't hear.
The audience?

18:45.250 --> 18:46.478
In order to
pull off this heist,

18:46.550 --> 18:47.710
the theater has to be full.

18:47.790 --> 18:49.678
(LAUGHS) And why,
pray tell, is that?

18:49.760 --> 18:50.988
For cover!

18:51.060 --> 18:53.824
Look, getting inside
the room is one thing,

18:53.900 --> 18:55.822
but getting the loot out
without detection

18:55.900 --> 18:57.322
is decidedly
more difficult.

18:57.400 --> 18:59.595
We're talking about
a truckload of gold!

18:59.670 --> 19:01.433
And without cover,
we'd be Spotted

19:01.500 --> 19:03.764
before we got
the first armful out.

19:03.840 --> 19:08.436
Now, Barber of Seville
closes tomorrow,

19:08.510 --> 19:10.705
which means _
we're gonna have to waIt
for next month's Show

19:10.780 --> 19:12.247
in order to pull off
this heist.

19:12.310 --> 19:13.516
Next month?

19:13.580 --> 19:16.117
