MAN ON TV: Do you realize
what are you...

00:39.520 --> 00:40.520
Wait there.

00:50.240 --> 00:52.680
No, pussy.

00:56.440 --> 00:57.440
Hmm?

01:00.840 --> 01:03.200
Good day, young man.

01:15.880 --> 01:17.480
MR. BEAN: What is that?

01:26.160 --> 01:28.160
Oh.

01:28.240 --> 01:29.480
Right.

01:58.640 --> 01:59.960
Huh?

02:00.040 --> 02:02.280
Thank you.

02:08.080 --> 02:10.360
Huh. Hmm...

02:28.800 --> 02:30.320
Bon appetit.

02:58.080 --> 02:59.520

Hmm. Oh!

03:08.960 --> 03:10.800
DOCTOR:

03:12.760 --> 03:14.480

03:15.720 --> 03:16.800
Goodness me!

03:22.360 --> 03:23.680
Hey, are you all right, man?

03:23.760 --> 03:24.800
What--now, let me.

03:26.640 --> 03:27.800
Does it--

03:27.880 --> 03:28.920
Your legs, right?

03:30.760 --> 03:32.440
Hang on.

03:32.520 --> 03:33.880
Yes, an ambulance.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.160
Quickly as possible, yes.

03:39.120 --> 03:40.400
In you go.

03:53.440 --> 03:55.720
Hmm.

04:05.560 --> 04:06.960
NURSE: Aha!

04:07.040 --> 04:08.520
Mr. Bean?

04:09.840 --> 04:11.400
Tea?

04:11.480 --> 04:12.600
Now, then,

04:12.680 --> 04:15.240
let's take your temperature.

04:15.320 --> 04:17.120
In we go.

04:20.200 --> 04:22.800
Now, this.
There we are.

04:22.880 --> 04:24.960
- Now then.
- Hmm.

04:30.840 --> 04:33.720
Hmm. And again.

04:36.720 --> 04:37.960
Now then,

04:39.200 --> 04:41.200
what do we have?

04:46.200 --> 04:48.640
All right.
You should be ready.

04:48.720 --> 04:49.760
Oh!

04:52.640 --> 04:54.520
Out of my way, please.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.760
NURSE: Yes, yes, I understand.

05:05.840 --> 05:06.880
No, no, no.
You can't...

05:08.080 --> 05:10.000
I'll be back in a few minutes.

05:10.080 --> 05:11.400
Yes, yes.
Thank you.

05:11.480 --> 05:13.360
What's that?

05:16.480 --> 05:19.640
Right, I should be there
in a few minutes.

05:42.400 --> 05:44.200
Hmm.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.560
Come along.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.400
- Ow. Ow.
- NURSE: Yeah.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.440
- Ow. Oh.
- Here we go.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.320
Oh, dear.

06:00.400 --> 06:01.840
Ah.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.280
Come along now.

06:04.360 --> 06:06.360
That's it.

06:06.440 --> 06:08.080
There we go.

06:13.120 --> 06:14.680
All right.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.120
Right, come along.

06:26.520 --> 06:27.720
In you go.
That's it.

06:27.800 --> 06:28.920
Sit up straight.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.600
And now,

06:30.680 --> 06:32.360
there we are.

06:32.440 --> 06:34.120
And...

06:40.600 --> 06:42.680
Oh dear, oh dear.

06:42.760 --> 06:43.680
There you are.

06:43.760 --> 06:45.400
Oh, oh, poor man.

06:45.480 --> 06:47.080
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.

06:47.160 --> 06:48.160
Oh, dear.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.560
Come along, all right,

06:51.640 --> 06:52.800
now then, off we go.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.200
Down here.

06:55.280 --> 06:56.520
Stay there.

07:00.800 --> 07:02.600
DOCTOR: Good morning.

07:02.680 --> 07:05.280
Let's see here.

07:05.360 --> 07:08.680
Now, what seems to be
the trouble?

07:08.760 --> 07:10.600
NURSE:
This is the problem, Doctor.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.040
DOCTOR: Ah, yeah.

07:12.120 --> 07:14.280
Swallowed his Teddy, eh?

07:14.360 --> 07:15.600
- NURSE: I don't understand.
- DOCTOR: Hmm.

07:15.680 --> 07:17.640
We have to operate,
I think.

07:17.720 --> 07:19.000
Hmm.

07:19.080 --> 07:20.480
NURSE: Down.

07:20.560 --> 07:22.120
DOCTOR: Now then.

07:22.200 --> 07:24.120
Marker.

07:25.360 --> 07:26.400
DOCTOR: Um-hmm.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.440
- MR. BEAN: What--
- DOCTOR: Hmm.

07:28.520 --> 07:30.440
NURSE: Stay put.

07:30.520 --> 07:32.320
DOCTOR: Good, good.

07:32.400 --> 07:33.560
Aha.

07:38.040 --> 07:40.080
Ah.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.200
There we are.

07:42.280 --> 07:44.600
Now. Nurse, scalpel.

07:44.680 --> 07:46.960
NURSE: Scalpel.

07:47.040 --> 07:48.080
DOCTOR: File.

07:48.160 --> 07:49.720
NURSE: File.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.280
Pop him out would you, nurse?

07:56.280 --> 07:57.720
NURSE: Here we go.

07:59.280 --> 08:01.080
DOCTOR: Come back,
you haven't been--

08:03.720 --> 08:06.760
Teddy, there you are.

08:06.840 --> 08:08.760
Come on, come on.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.120
Oh, what the?

08:22.240 --> 08:23.640
Hey, come back here!

08:23.720 --> 08:25.000

08:27.000 --> 08:28.200

- Here we go.

08:28.280 --> 08:30.000
Oh, goodness me. Right!

08:31.400 --> 08:35.440
- Oh, no.
- I've got you. Stop!

08:37.160 --> 08:39.680
MR. BEAN: Get out of my way!
Get of the way!

08:39.760 --> 08:41.760
NURSE: Come back here!

08:43.680 --> 08:45.920
Oh.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.440
Hey, hey, oh.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.640
Oh.

08:52.720 --> 08:53.800

- Uh-oh.

08:53.880 --> 08:55.320
MAN: No.

08:55.400 --> 08:56.640
N-No!

08:56.720 --> 08:58.120
Oh!

09:26.120 --> 09:28.000
MR. BEAN: Oh, no.

09:41.360 --> 09:42.520
MR. BEAN: Ow.

09:48.720 --> 09:51.960
Ahh. Oh.

09:52.040 --> 09:54.160
- There you are.
- Thanks.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.200
Uh-hmm.

10:05.360 --> 10:07.200
Another one.

10:10.600 --> 10:13.080
All right, another one.

10:13.160 --> 10:14.880
And another.

10:17.320 --> 10:18.480
Hmm, how about...

10:20.600 --> 10:21.720
- Go.

10:21.800 --> 10:23.000
Oh, goodness me.

10:24.680 --> 10:26.400
Oh.
