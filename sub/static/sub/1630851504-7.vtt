You didn't have
to bring the cart

17:16.201 --> 17:17.443
all the way
into the paint booth.

17:17.527 --> 17:19.195
- Why not?
It's what we got it for.

17:19.279 --> 17:20.955

in the paint booth.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.783
You could've stopped out there,
just hollered at me.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.793
- It's special delivery.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.962
- Well, take it off the cart
and we'll take it back

17:28.047 --> 17:30.289
out of the booth
and then find a spot for it.

17:30.373 --> 17:31.716

to go out?

17:31.875 --> 17:33.134
We can put trash back
in this thing

17:33.218 --> 17:36.462
and, you know,
I can stop by the trash can.

17:36.555 --> 17:38.214
- You know what?
I'm gonna take you up on that.

17:38.298 --> 17:39.799
I'm gonna shut up and
I'm gonna take you up on that.

17:39.883 --> 17:42.393

That's what I'm talking about.

17:42.478 --> 17:45.646
You got more stuff, man.

17:45.806 --> 17:50.401

none of my fender stands, dude.

17:50.560 --> 17:53.237

on a rotisserie.

visit some of
the old paint jobs,

19:17.230 --> 19:19.323
see if I can't get some kind of
inspiration for this thing.

19:19.482 --> 19:21.826
I've been waiting 16 years
to paint my van

19:21.985 --> 19:24.745
and I see it almost painted
in my head,

19:24.830 --> 19:26.747
but I can't get past
just blue metal flake.

19:26.832 --> 19:30.001
- No, you cannot ever
just paint it blue.

19:30.160 --> 19:31.669
Look at how beautiful
this paint job is.

19:31.828 --> 19:33.921
If you had just flaked out
this car red,

19:34.080 --> 19:36.248
it would be a beautiful job
but not as badass as it is now.

19:36.341 --> 19:37.592
- On this car.

19:37.676 --> 19:39.594
I'm not talking about
a '55 gasser,

19:39.678 --> 19:41.262
I'm talking about Ryan's van.
Ryan's van. All right.

19:41.421 --> 19:42.430

just blue, just blue is boring.

19:42.589 --> 19:43.756
- Stop, stop, stop.

19:43.840 --> 19:45.099
- If this was just red,
it'd be boring.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.342
- You're going
the wrong direction.

19:46.435 --> 19:49.511
The '55 is '70s all day long.

19:49.596 --> 19:52.348
It's got the fans,
infinity lines, freak dots,

19:52.432 --> 19:56.352
weaving, metal flake,
fish scales, it's everything.

19:56.436 --> 20:00.856
But I don't know that I can
wake up to this every day

20:00.941 --> 20:02.775
for the next 10, 20 years.

20:02.868 --> 20:05.945
It's gorgeous, one of my
favorite-est paint jobs.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.112
I might get bored of it.

20:07.197 --> 20:08.364
- Did you just say favorite-est?

20:08.448 --> 20:09.707
- Favorite-est.

20:09.866 --> 20:11.200
Then I go over
to the panel truck, right?

20:11.284 --> 20:12.701
- Okay.

20:12.786 --> 20:16.038
- I know beyond a shadow
of a doubt every morning,

20:16.122 --> 20:18.132
30 years from now,
I can walk down the driveway,

20:18.291 --> 20:21.385
get in that, and drive it,
and still be in love with it.

20:21.470 --> 20:23.137
- Okay.
- Okay?

20:23.222 --> 20:24.630
- But you don't feel
the same way about that.

20:24.723 --> 20:26.140
You're not sure.

20:26.299 --> 20:27.800
- That's not my van.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.143
I'm trying to figure out
what to do with my van.

20:29.302 --> 20:31.979
Superfly. Now Superfly.

20:32.138 --> 20:34.732
- Superfly is just big pimping,
and flaked out already.

20:34.816 --> 20:37.401
- But it's a perfect example
of what I'm thinking of doing.

20:37.486 --> 20:40.896
- As far as the flake and all
the graphics and everything

20:40.989 --> 20:42.147
and keeping it all monotone?

20:42.241 --> 20:43.491
- This is a gold car.

20:43.575 --> 20:45.651
- Are you just telling me
what colors are?

20:45.735 --> 20:47.069
- I'm explaining it to you.

20:47.162 --> 20:48.320
- I know what colors it is.

20:48.413 --> 20:49.997
- Imagine a blue van.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.157
- So this is all kind of
a monotone stuff

20:52.251 --> 20:54.335
and it all blends together
with the graphics.

20:54.419 --> 20:58.080
- Exactly.
- Are you planning on loud?

20:58.164 --> 20:59.674
Because obviously
you're not just doing flake.

20:59.758 --> 21:04.003
- I don't know.
I don't know if I can be--

21:04.096 --> 21:07.682
- Great almighty Ryan
doesn't have any idea

21:07.766 --> 21:09.517
what he's gonna do.
Because it's your stuff.

21:09.676 --> 21:11.352
- It's mine. It's my van.

21:11.436 --> 21:13.104
- You're thinking of these as,
you know,

21:13.188 --> 21:15.014
that looks great on that,
and that looks great on that,

21:15.107 --> 21:16.682
and that,

21:16.775 --> 21:19.018
but you're not thinking about
you're an artist,

21:19.102 --> 21:20.695
you got to throw it all at it.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.521
You're basically
censoring yourself.

21:22.614 --> 21:25.024
- It's not censoring,
it's being practical.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.451
I'm gonna work out of it,
I can't work on this thing

21:27.610 --> 21:29.954
for the next year
trying to paint it.

21:30.038 --> 21:34.125
But like you said, it needs
to be a rolling billboard,

21:34.284 --> 21:36.785
it needs to be
a rolling portfolio.

21:36.878 --> 21:38.203
- There, that's a better word.

21:38.297 --> 21:42.466
- It needs to stand out,
but still be practical.

21:42.625 --> 21:44.126
- So you need to paint
it more than blue.

21:44.210 --> 21:47.888
But if you feel that blue
is all you have inside you,

21:47.973 --> 21:50.558
that's all you have
to give the van, that's fine.

21:50.642 --> 21:51.809
Paint it blue.

21:51.968 --> 21:53.394
Hey, the whole shop
will sit around

21:53.553 --> 21:55.387
and just make fun of you daily.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.565
- Spite. I like that.

21:57.649 --> 21:59.650
- Ryan's always
holding himself back.

21:59.809 --> 22:01.060
- So I went through
the show room

22:01.144 --> 22:02.895
to get a little visual
inspiration, right?

22:02.979 --> 22:04.730
My old buddy, Mike, he showed me

22:04.823 --> 22:07.733
a whole new direction
to go through with it.

22:07.817 --> 22:10.152
Good old fashioned
stubborn spite

22:10.245 --> 22:11.904
because there's no way in hell

22:11.997 --> 22:14.332
I'm gonna have to listen
to Mike's snide remarks

22:14.491 --> 22:17.576
every single day
about how Ryan fell short.

22:17.669 --> 22:22.423
So better believe this van
is gonna be badass.

22:22.582 --> 22:24.750
- It's the baddest artist
around, he can do everything.

22:24.834 --> 22:26.251
- That's what I needed to hear.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.179
- But he just painted it blue,
that's awesome!

22:28.338 --> 22:30.014
- I can work with spite.
Thanks, Mike.

22:30.173 --> 22:33.017

Now, the front half,

23:50.086 --> 23:52.921
I was thinking about
something like this.

23:53.014 --> 23:57.426
- Oh man, man.
Man, look at that.

23:57.519 --> 24:00.104
- It's vinyl. Which is tough.

24:00.188 --> 24:01.772
It's almost the same color
as the dash

24:01.857 --> 24:03.348
so we don't have to do anything
but clean the dash up.

24:03.433 --> 24:04.859
- It looks exactly
like the dash.

24:05.018 --> 24:06.685
- And then this is like a '70s.

24:06.778 --> 24:08.195

24:08.354 --> 24:09.855

- Checkered velour.

some big diamonds in it.

24:11.950 --> 24:13.617

what it needs to be.

"No, just put some new tape,

a lot of seats in cars.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.002
you get all kinds of materials
out of him.

25:05.161 --> 25:06.328

- May I ask,

25:58.381 --> 26:00.215
what is your connection
with the military, sir?

26:00.300 --> 26:02.226
- In '65, I was in the Navy.

26:02.385 --> 26:04.311
I had orders
to De Nang, Vietnam.

26:04.396 --> 26:06.555
Went home, there was
some family problems,

26:06.639 --> 26:07.815
they cancelled my orders.

26:07.899 --> 26:09.808
But all of my friends,

26:09.901 --> 26:13.904
guys I served with that year
before, they went.

26:14.063 --> 26:16.064

And there's been a hole

26:18.985 --> 26:20.411
"You should've been
there with them."

26:20.495 --> 26:23.247
So, I wanted to do something
special to honor them.

so much love
