WEBVTT

00:04.972 --> 00:07.708
OH! THIS DISHWASHING LIQUID
ISN'T CRUELTY-FREE!

00:07.741 --> 00:08.776
I KNOW.

00:08.809 --> 00:10.411
WELL, WHY DID YOU BUY IT
AFTER I TOLD YOU IT WASN'T?!

00:10.444 --> 00:11.479
BECAUSE I LIKE IT.

00:11.512 --> 00:14.615
THEY PROBABLY TESTED IT
BY MAKING KITTENS DRINK IT.

00:14.648 --> 00:15.583
YEAH. SORRY.

00:15.616 --> 00:16.817
DO YOU EVEN UNDERSTAND
WHAT CRUELTY

00:16.850 --> 00:18.152
DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S
NOT CRUELTY

00:18.186 --> 00:19.520
THIS CONVERSATION,
ALL RIGHT?

00:19.553 --> 00:23.057
SO LAY OFF, OR I'M GONNA
TEST MY FINGERNAILS
ON YOUR LITTLE EYEBALLS.

00:23.091 --> 00:25.659
HEY, MOM,
WHAT DOES VEAL TASTE LIKE?

00:25.693 --> 00:26.360
YOU BOUGHT VEAL?!

00:26.394 --> 00:27.361
OH, GIVE ME A BREAK,
ALL RIGHT?

00:27.395 --> 00:29.397
I'M MAKING
SOMETHING SPECIAL
FOR YOUR DAD

00:29.430 --> 00:30.164
FOR OUR ANNIVERSARY.

00:30.198 --> 00:32.400
OH. VEAL TASTES LIKE
A BABY ANIMAL

00:32.433 --> 00:35.403
WHO HAS LIVED ITS ENTIRE LIFE
IN A TINY CRATE.

00:35.436 --> 00:38.672
WOW. MUST BE TENDER.

00:40.641 --> 00:43.177
YEAH, IT IS.
LET'S CROSS THE STREET.
COME ON.

00:43.211 --> 00:44.445
BUT OUR CAR IS ON THIS SIDE.

00:44.478 --> 00:46.847
MM-HMM.
SHE DOESN'T WANT US
NEAR THE CONVICTS.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.150
WHOA! THOSE GUYS
ARE CONVICTS?

00:49.183 --> 00:50.684
NO, THEY'RE
NOT CONVICTS.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.853
THEY'RE PERFORMING
A PUBLIC SERVICE.

00:52.886 --> 00:53.721
HUH. THAT'S NICE OF THEM.

00:53.754 --> 00:56.624
BECAUSE THEY WERE
CONVICTED OF A CRIME.

00:56.657 --> 00:57.691
IT'S STILL NICE.

00:57.725 --> 00:58.692
YES, IT IS.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.128
DAD'S NICE.

01:00.161 --> 01:02.563
YEAH, HE IS.
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

01:02.596 --> 01:05.766
'CAUSE HE'S OVER THERE
HELPING THOSE CONVICTS.

01:27.755 --> 01:28.689
WHOA, DAD WAS SCRUBBING
GRAFFITI OFF A WALL?

01:28.722 --> 01:30.491
YUP.
WHAT'D HE DO?

01:30.524 --> 01:31.392
WE DON'T KNOW.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.761
I HOPE HE ROBBED A BANK.
THEN WE'D BE RICH.

01:33.794 --> 01:37.365
WELL, HE OBVIOUSLY
DIDN'T GET AWAY WITH IT, MORON.

01:37.398 --> 01:39.633
HE'S SCRUBBING GRAFFITI
OFF A WALL.

01:39.667 --> 01:43.204
YOU KNOW, I WONDER
IF HE LIFTS WEIGHTS

01:43.237 --> 01:44.472
WITH A BUNCH
OF MURDERERS
ALL DAY.

01:44.505 --> 01:47.608
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
JUST BECAUSE YOUR FATHER
WAS SCRUBBING GRAFFITI

01:47.641 --> 01:49.377
UNDER THE SUPERVISION
OF A POLICEMAN

01:49.410 --> 01:50.478
AND HE NEVER TOLD ME,
HIS WIFE--

01:50.511 --> 01:53.614
TELLS ME HE'S
AT SOFTBALL LEAGUE
ON OUR ANNIVERSARY--

01:53.647 --> 01:54.815
MOM, ISN'T THAT ENOUGH SOAP?

01:54.848 --> 01:58.586
OH, YOUR DAD'S
A CRIMINAL.
WHO CARES?

01:59.787 --> 02:01.622
CLAUDIA?

02:01.655 --> 02:04.358
WELL, HEY,
YOU'RE HOME!

02:04.392 --> 02:06.194
YEAH, BABY.
HI.

02:06.227 --> 02:07.161
HOW WAS SOFTBALL?

02:07.195 --> 02:08.896
OH, IT WAS GREAT.
IT WAS GREAT.

02:08.929 --> 02:10.698
YOU KNOW, COACH HAS ME
OUT IN LEFT FIELD,

02:10.731 --> 02:12.533
AND I SAID,
HEY, I GOT A GREAT ARM.

02:12.566 --> 02:14.902
PUT ME IN THE HOT POCKET,
BUT...

02:14.935 --> 02:15.936
WHY DOESN'T HE?

02:15.969 --> 02:18.739
OH, YOU KNOW,
HE'S GOT HIS SON-IN-LAW
AT THIRD.

02:18.772 --> 02:20.908
HE'S A GREAT GUY. HE'S BIG,
BUT HE'S KINDA SLOW.

02:20.941 --> 02:23.177
YOU KNOW,
BUT IT'S A 10-GAME SEASON,

02:23.211 --> 02:24.812
SO I GOT A LOT OF SATURDAYS
TO PROVE MYSELF.

02:24.845 --> 02:29.450
GOD, THAT FEELS SO GOOD.
I'M SO SORE, YOU KNOW?

02:29.483 --> 02:31.285
YEAH, I KNOW.

02:31.319 --> 02:34.355
SO WHAT WERE YOU
CONVICTED OF?

02:35.623 --> 02:36.724
WHAT?

02:36.757 --> 02:38.392
I SAW YOU
SCRUBBING GRAFFITI!

02:38.426 --> 02:40.694
YOUR CHILDREN SAW YOU
SCRUBBING GRAFFITI.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.563
WHAT DID YOU DO?
AW, IT WAS NO BIG THING.

02:42.596 --> 02:44.632
WELL, THEN WHY THE HELL
DID YOU KEEP IT
A SECRET FROM--

02:44.665 --> 02:46.800
OK, NOW YOU'RE OVERREACTING!

02:47.601 --> 02:48.269
OH, I'M SORRY.

02:48.302 --> 02:49.237
WHAT'S
THE APPROPRIATE REACTION

02:49.270 --> 02:51.539
TO FINDING OUT
YOUR HUSBAND'S
ON A CHAIN GANG?

02:51.572 --> 02:52.573
IT'S NOT A CHAIN GANG,
YOU KNOW?

02:52.606 --> 02:56.810
IT'S--IT'S
A GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED
SERVICE PROGRAM.

02:56.844 --> 02:57.878
SO YOU'RE
LIKE AN ASTRONAUT?

02:57.911 --> 02:59.680
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
NONE OF THIS
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED

02:59.713 --> 03:03.584
IF YOU HADN'T BEEN PLAYING
GAMES WITH OUR ANNIVERSARY.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.286
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

03:05.319 --> 03:06.287
THE GIFT THING.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.756
WE WENT
OVER AND OVER THAT.

03:08.789 --> 03:10.291
NO GIFTS THIS YEAR.

03:10.324 --> 03:11.659
I AGREE.

03:11.692 --> 03:12.860
ARE YOU SURE?

03:12.893 --> 03:14.027
ABSOLUTELY.

03:14.061 --> 03:15.729
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE'LL JUST END UP
SPENDING TOO MUCH MONEY

03:15.763 --> 03:17.598
ON SOME STUPID CRAP
THAT WE DON'T NEED

03:17.631 --> 03:19.600
JUST TO PROVE SOMETHING
THAT WE ALREADY KNOW.

03:19.633 --> 03:22.002
RIGHT. WHICH IS?

03:22.035 --> 03:23.737
THAT WE LOVE EACH OTHER.

03:23.771 --> 03:26.974
OF COURSE. OF COURSE.
YEAH, RIGHT. NO GIFTS.

03:27.007 --> 03:28.676
NO GIFTS.
AND I MEANT IT.

03:28.709 --> 03:31.412
YEAH, AND FOR A WHILE THERE
I ALMOST BELIEVED YOU.

03:31.445 --> 03:36.884
I'M TELLING YOU.
HER EXACT WORDS WERE
"NO GIFTS THIS YEAR."

03:36.917 --> 03:38.986
SO, UH, WHAT ARE YOU
GETTING HER?

03:39.019 --> 03:41.722
NOTHING.

03:41.755 --> 03:42.723
WHAT?

03:42.756 --> 03:43.657
IN 30 YEARS OF MARRIAGE,

03:43.691 --> 03:45.659
EVERY CHRISTMAS,
EVERY BIRTHDAY

03:45.693 --> 03:48.562
YOUR MOTHER WOULD SAY TO ME,
"DON'T GET ME ANYTHING."

03:48.596 --> 03:50.798
AND THE ONE TIME I DIDN'T,
HOLY HANNAH!

03:50.831 --> 03:54.735
SEAN, WOMEN SAY
THEY DON'T WANT YOU
TO GET THEM ANYTHING

03:54.768 --> 03:57.004
'CAUSE THEY WANT YOU
TO WANT TO GET THEM
SOMETHING.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.939
IT'S PROOF OF YOUR DESIRE
TO PLEASE THEM.

03:58.972 --> 04:02.976
YEAH, BUT I'M TERRIBLE
AT PICKING STUFF OUT
FOR HER, YOU KNOW?

04:03.877 --> 04:05.646
IT'S A UNICORN.

04:05.679 --> 04:07.848
OH.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.784
IT'S A HOME YOGURT MAKER.

04:10.818 --> 04:12.553
OH.

04:12.586 --> 04:13.554
IT'S AN EMERGENCY LIGHT.

04:13.587 --> 04:17.891
IT'S GOT A TV AND A RADIO,
AND IT'S GOT A SIREN.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.026
OH.

04:19.059 --> 04:20.628
IT'S FOR EMERGENCIES.

04:22.563 --> 04:25.766
BY THE WAY, THANKS
FOR THE YOGURT MACHINE.

04:25.799 --> 04:27.801
SHE NEVER EVEN
OPENED THE BOX.

04:27.835 --> 04:29.837
THAT MAKES 2 OF US.

04:29.870 --> 04:30.971
HEY, DON'T WORRY, SEAN.

04:31.004 --> 04:33.841
I GOT THE PERFECT THING.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.810
DAD, THAT WAS MOM'S.

04:36.844 --> 04:39.747
YOUR MOTHER CRIED
WHEN I GAVE IT TO HER.

04:39.780 --> 04:40.814
AND I CAN HAVE IT?

04:40.848 --> 04:42.950
IT WOULD BE AN HONOR.

04:42.983 --> 04:47.888
THANKS, DAD.

04:47.921 --> 04:50.691
AAH! DAD!

04:50.724 --> 04:51.224
WHAT?

04:51.258 --> 04:52.360
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

04:52.393 --> 04:54.662
OH, I'M GIVING THIS
TO YOUR MOTHER
FOR OUR ANNIVERSARY.

04:54.695 --> 04:55.863
YOU LIKE IT?

04:55.896 --> 04:56.897
IT'S GROTESQUE!

04:56.930 --> 05:00.033
HE USED TO BE ALIVE
SCAMPERING THROUGH
THE FOREST

05:00.067 --> 05:01.068
LOOKING FOR NUTS.

05:01.101 --> 05:03.437
OH, COME ON, LILY.
IT'S A FOX. IT DIDN'T EAT NUTS.

05:03.471 --> 05:04.838
IT ATE, LIKE, YOU KNOW,
BUNNIES.

05:04.872 --> 05:06.540
OH, AND FOR THAT
WE KILLED IT?

05:06.574 --> 05:08.542
IT WAS KILLED, LIKE,
OVER 30 YEARS AGO.

05:08.576 --> 05:10.444
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD
BY NOW ANYWAY.

05:10.478 --> 05:11.945
OH, SO THAT LETS YOU
OFF THE HOOK?

05:11.979 --> 05:14.715
OH, OK. OK, MISS HYPOCRITE,
WHAT ABOUT YOUR SHOES?

05:14.748 --> 05:16.550
WERE DO YOU THINK WE GET
THE LEATHER FOR THOSE, HUH?

05:16.584 --> 05:18.752
WE DON'T KNOW
HOW THIS COW DIED.

05:18.786 --> 05:21.355
OH, NO, BUT IT PROBABLY DIED
LEAVING A LITTLE NOTE SAYING,

05:21.389 --> 05:22.956
"PLEASE CUT MY SKIN
INTO LITTLE STRIPS

05:22.990 --> 05:25.559
AND MAKE A BELT
FOR LILY FINNERTY."

05:25.593 --> 05:27.027
HMM?

05:27.060 --> 05:29.597
OH, GOD!

05:29.630 --> 05:31.665
I DIDN'T THINK
ABOUT THAT.

05:31.699 --> 05:32.766
NO.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.836
I AM JUST AS GUILTY
AS THE BUTCHER WHO
CREATED THIS--

05:35.869 --> 05:37.938
THIS HIDEOUS SOUVENIR
OF SUFFERING.

05:37.971 --> 05:42.376
BUT DO YOU THINK
YOUR MOM'LL LIKE IT?

05:42.410 --> 05:44.378
WELL, NO WONDER
LILY'S BEEN SO ANNOYING.

05:44.412 --> 05:45.746
YOU TRAUMATIZED HER.

05:45.779 --> 05:48.048
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, BABY,
BECAUSE I DIDN'T GET IT
FOR YOU ANYWAY.

05:48.081 --> 05:51.485
WHY? BECAUSE YOU WERE
TOO BUSY PAYING OFF
YOUR DEBT TO SOCIETY?

05:51.519 --> 05:52.886
NO.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.589
BECAUSE, I, UH...

05:56.189 --> 05:57.090
I GOT YOU THIS INSTEAD.

05:57.124 --> 05:59.960
COME ON! I TOLD YOU
I DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING!

05:59.993 --> 06:01.429
THEN DON'T OPEN IT.

06:01.462 --> 06:03.564
WELL, I'M NOT GOING TO.

06:07.868 --> 06:10.571
HEY, BABY.
HEY, BABY.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.005
YOU READY TO GO?

06:12.039 --> 06:13.607
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT,

06:13.641 --> 06:15.943
AND I DON'T REALLY
WANT TO GO.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.044
WHA

06:17.077 --> 06:19.480
NO, NO, NO.
SEE, YOU HAVE TO GO

06:19.513 --> 06:21.782
BECAUSE THIS IS
DONKEY BASKETBALL.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.951
DEAN, DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S KIND OF BARBARIC?

06:23.984 --> 06:28.622
NO. IT'S NUNS ON DONKEYS
PLAYING BASKETBALL.

06:28.989 --> 06:30.824
YEAH, AND, YOU KNOW,
IT IS FOR CHARITY.

06:30.858 --> 06:34.127
TO HELL WITH CHARITY.
IT'S JUST FUN.

06:35.996 --> 06:40.734
WHOA! I'M OPEN!
I'M--AAH!

06:43.671 --> 06:46.139
Girl:
GO, SISTER ANNE! WHOO!

06:46.173 --> 06:50.444
OHH-H-H-H-H!

06:50.478 --> 06:52.480
WHOO!

06:52.513 --> 06:54.582
IT JUST SEEMS SO CRUEL.

06:54.615 --> 06:56.950
IT'S NO MORE CRUEL
THAN WHAT DO IN THE NBA.

06:56.984 --> 06:58.886
THEY DON'T RIDE ON DONKEYS.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.154
WELL, THEY SHOULD.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.858
I WISH THEY COULD DONKEY-UP,
LIKE, EVERY SPORT.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.126
LIKE DONKEY BASEBALL.

07:06.159 --> 07:07.961
OR DONKEY TENNIS.

07:07.995 --> 07:08.962
DONKEY BOWLING.

07:08.996 --> 07:10.130
DONKEY HORSE RACING.

07:10.163 --> 07:14.001
YEAH, A GUY ON A DONKEY
ON A HORSE.

07:14.034 --> 07:17.638
A NUN ON A DONKEY ON A HORSE.

07:17.671 --> 07:21.909
A GUY ON A NUN
ON A DONKEY ON A HORSE.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.811
YEAH!

07:25.112 --> 07:27.214
CAN WE JUST LET
THE DONKEYS BE?

07:29.149 --> 07:32.620
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

07:35.856 --> 07:39.259
HEY, GET OUT
OF MY PARKING SPACE!

07:39.292 --> 07:41.161
THERE'S A DONKEY OUT THERE.

07:41.194 --> 07:42.963
THAT IS SO WEIRD.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.131
GET OUT!

07:45.933 --> 07:49.937
IS IT, LIKE, A KEY CHAIN
WITH A LITTLE LIGHT ON IT?

07:49.970 --> 07:53.206
DOESN'T MATTER.
YOU DON'T WANT IT.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.776
IT'S TOO LIGHT TO BE
A PAPERWEIGHT.

07:55.809 --> 07:56.910
COME ON, JUST OPEN IT.

07:56.944 --> 07:58.512
NO, NO.
COME ON.

07:58.546 --> 08:01.815
COME ON. OK, I WILL.

08:02.616 --> 08:07.187
DIAMOND EARRINGS?
OH, MY GOD.

08:07.220 --> 08:09.757
THESE ARE
SO BEAUTIFUL.
SEE?

08:09.790 --> 08:11.525
HOW CAN WE AFFORD THESE?

08:11.559 --> 08:12.860
AW, BABY, YOU'RE WORTH IT.

08:12.893 --> 08:15.796
OH, SWEETIE.
OH, MY GOD.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.064
YOU'RE CRAZY.

08:17.097 --> 08:17.965
WHOO!

08:17.998 --> 08:19.099
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU.

08:19.132 --> 08:20.033
I KNOW.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.234
I GAVE YOU ALL THE CRAP

08:21.268 --> 08:24.037
ABOUT THAT STUPID
COMMUNITY SERVICE THING.

08:24.071 --> 08:26.640
YEAH, YOU DID, UH-HUH.

08:30.944 --> 08:34.748
OH, MY GOD,
YOU STOLE THESE!

08:34.782 --> 08:35.716
NO, I DIDN'T.

08:35.749 --> 08:38.018
OH...HOW'D YOU GET 'EM?

08:38.051 --> 08:39.019
IT WAS COMPLICATED.

08:39.052 --> 08:40.788
OH, JUST TAKE 'EM BACK.

08:40.821 --> 08:41.655
NO, NO!

08:41.689 --> 08:42.322
TAKE THEM BACK!

08:42.355 --> 08:43.056
I'M NOT TAKING 'EM BACK.

08:43.090 --> 08:44.725
TAKE 'EM BACK!
I DON'T WANT 'EM!

08:44.758 --> 08:48.028
AW, GREAT! NOW THEY'RE
UNDER THE FRIDGE.

08:48.061 --> 08:48.996
WELL, GOOD.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.031
GOOD? I WENT THROUGH A LOT
TO GET THESE THINGS.

08:51.064 --> 08:52.966
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T WANNA KNOW.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.335
BABY, I JUST WANTED TO GET YOU
SOMETHING SPECIAL.

08:55.368 --> 08:58.105
DIAMOND EARRINGS.
SHE'LL LIKE THOSE, RIGHT?

08:58.138 --> 09:00.741
WHICH ONES,
THE BROWNISH ONES?

09:00.774 --> 09:01.742
THEY'RE BROWNISH?

09:01.775 --> 09:03.677
IT'S NOT THAT NOTICEABLE
'CAUSE THEY'RE SO SMALL.

09:03.711 --> 09:04.978
YEAH, BUT THEY'RE THE ONLY
ONES I CAN AFFORD,

09:05.012 --> 09:05.946
AND I CAN'T EVEN
AFFORD THESE.

09:05.979 --> 09:09.216
THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM.
YOU FALL FOR THE BIG LIE.

09:09.249 --> 09:10.183
THE BIG LIE?

09:10.217 --> 09:12.920
IN AFRICA, THE RIVERBEDS
ARE FULL OF DIAMONDS.

09:12.953 --> 09:15.022
PEOPLE PICK 'EM UP,
SKIP 'EM ON THE POND.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.224
THEY USE DIAMONDS
AS AQUARIUM GRAVEL.

09:17.257 --> 09:18.959
OH, REALLY, DO THEY?
YEAH.

09:18.992 --> 09:21.061
THE DIAMOND CARTEL DOESN'T
WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT.

09:21.094 --> 09:24.832
FORTUNATELY,
I KNOW A GUY WHO WORKS
OUTSIDE THE SYSTEM.

09:24.865 --> 09:25.498
NO WAY.

09:25.532 --> 09:26.934
GIVE HIM A CHANCE.
FORGET IT.

09:26.967 --> 09:27.868
HE'S BEEN IN
THE BUSINESS 20 YEARS.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.704
HE OWNS A SHOP.
HE'S NEVER STEERED ME WRONG.

09:30.738 --> 09:32.172
YOU'RE SAYING
THIS GUY'S LEGIT?

09:32.205 --> 09:34.107
HE'S LEGIT.

09:34.141 --> 09:36.644
100%.

09:36.677 --> 09:39.112
HE SELLS VCRs.

09:39.146 --> 09:40.113
AND DIAMONDS.

09:40.147 --> 09:41.148
LIKE WALMART.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.984
SHOULDN'T IT SAY SOMEWHERE
THAT HE SELLS DIAMONDS?

09:44.017 --> 09:46.654
YEAH, RIGHT, LIKE HE'S GONNA
ADVERTISE FOR THE CARTEL.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.689
"HERE I AM. COME SHOOT ME."

09:53.193 --> 09:55.763
HEY, MAN, I'M NOT
LOOKING FOR A VCR.

09:55.796 --> 09:59.299
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR.

10:01.969 --> 10:05.205
SEE, MAN, I TOLD YOU
HE WAS LEGIT.

10:05.839 --> 10:08.275
HEY, I WANT A BOMB POP.
YOU WANT A BOMB POP?

10:08.308 --> 10:09.276
NAH.

10:09.309 --> 10:13.814
I'M GONNA GO GET A BOMB POP.
TAKE CARE OF MY BOY.

10:19.152 --> 10:20.053
SEE ANYTHING YOU LIKE?

10:20.087 --> 10:22.189
YEAH. I MEAN, THESE ONES HERE,
THEY'RE GREAT.

10:22.222 --> 10:25.826
IT'S JUST I'M AFRAID THEY'RE
OUT OF MY PRICE RANGE PROBABLY.

10:25.859 --> 10:28.328
DON'T BE SO SURE.
WHAT'S YOUR PRICE RANGE?

10:28.361 --> 10:31.098
I DON'T KNOW. 300 BUCKS.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.299
THEY'RE YOURS!

10:32.332 --> 10:34.001
GREAT.

10:34.201 --> 10:38.305
POLICE! HANDS
WHERE WE CAN SEE 'EM!

10:42.475 --> 10:46.847
COME ON.
GIDDY-UP.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.716
YAAH, MULE!

10:48.749 --> 10:49.683
MUSH.

10:49.717 --> 10:51.752
Man: GET OUT
OF THE STREET!

10:51.785 --> 10:53.353
AW, RELAX, YOU JERK!

10:53.386 --> 10:54.387
HEY, GRANDPA,

10:54.421 --> 10:58.125
WHY DON'T YOU TELL THAT GUY
TO KISS YOUR..."ASS"?

10:58.158 --> 10:59.827
OH, MAN,
THAT'S BRILLIANT.

10:59.860 --> 11:03.897
ALL RIGHT, I HATE TO HAVE
TO RESORT TO THIS, BUT...

11:03.931 --> 11:07.901
OOH, CAREFUL, GRANDPA.
THAT'S ONE BIG..."ASS."

11:07.935 --> 11:11.038
GRANDPA, NO! DON'T YOU DARE
HURT THAT SWEET ANIMAL.

11:11.071 --> 11:13.073
I KNOW. IT'S SUCH
A SWEET "ASS."

11:13.106 --> 11:17.444
IT'S A DONKEY.
SO CALL IT A DONKEY.

11:17.477 --> 11:21.214
HERE, YOU PARK
THE CAR, BON JOVI.

11:23.784 --> 11:26.219
BRAD, WHAT IS THIS
DONKEY DOING HERE?

11:26.253 --> 11:30.891
IT FOLLOWED ME HOME. I--I THINK
I SMELL LIKE PEANUT BUTTER.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.794
WHAT'S WITH ALL THE DONKEYS?

11:33.827 --> 11:34.895
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

11:34.928 --> 11:36.463
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE BELT PARKWAY.

11:36.496 --> 11:37.765
I GOT STUCK FOR AN HOUR.

11:37.798 --> 11:38.866
OH, BOY.

11:38.899 --> 11:40.801
YEAH, THIS ONE WON'T GET OUT
OF GRANDPA'S PARKING SPOT.

11:40.834 --> 11:44.337
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA GET HIM
TO MOVE LIKE THAT.

11:51.411 --> 11:52.179
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?

11:52.212 --> 11:55.415
I SAW A THING ON ANIMAL PLANET.

11:56.917 --> 11:59.186
COME ON, CLAUDIA, GET DOWN HERE
AND GIMME A HAND.

11:59.219 --> 12:02.389
NO WAY. THAT WOULD
MAKE ME AN ACCESSORY.

12:02.422 --> 12:03.690
ALL RIGHT, I'M HERE
TO PICK UP THE KIDS.

12:03.723 --> 12:08.061
FORGET ABOUT IT, DAD.
OUR ANNIVERSARY PLANS
HIT KIND OF A KINK.

12:08.095 --> 12:08.796
SEAN'S A FELON.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.330
IT WAS SOME KIND
OF MISDEMEANOR.

12:10.363 --> 12:13.400
OH, AND HERE'S THE MAN
WHO MADE IT ALL POSSIBLE.

12:13.433 --> 12:14.601
WHAT
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

12:14.634 --> 12:17.504
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE SHOWING UP HERE
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED.

12:17.537 --> 12:19.472
OH, YOU KNOW,
I DON'T CARRY GRUDGES.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.875
YOU? WHY WOULD YOU
CARRY A GRUDGE?

12:21.909 --> 12:24.912
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO GOT ME
THROWN IN THE CAN.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.315
SEAN.

12:28.916 --> 12:29.983
HOW YOU DOIN'?

12:30.017 --> 12:31.919
HOW THE HELL
DO YOU THINK I'M DOING, MAN?
I'M IN JAIL.

12:31.952 --> 12:35.522
THEY TOOK MY SHOELACES.
THEY TOOK MY BELT.

12:35.555 --> 12:37.958
THEY DO THAT.
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

12:37.991 --> 12:38.926
OH, YEAH?

12:41.394 --> 12:44.965
I DON'T THINK
YOU WANNA BE DOING THAT.

12:47.901 --> 12:48.836
WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?

12:48.869 --> 12:51.839
WHERE HAVE I BEEN?
I'VE BEEN PROCURING FOR YOU

12:51.872 --> 12:53.841
THE FINEST LITIGATOR
AVAILABLE.

12:53.874 --> 12:57.978
I GET YOU OFF,
OR YOU DON'T PAY.

13:00.480 --> 13:05.485
ISN'T THAT
THAT SCUZBAG LAWYER WHO
ADVERTISES ON CHANNEL 94?

13:05.518 --> 13:08.956
EWW, WALT. ISN'T 94
THE PORNO CHANNEL?

13:08.989 --> 13:10.991
NO, NO, NO.

13:11.024 --> 13:15.462
ON MY CABLE SYSTEM,
94--THAT'S, UH...C-SPAN.

13:15.495 --> 13:16.329
YEAH.

13:16.363 --> 13:19.266
NO, NO, IT IS. LET'S
FIND THOSE EARRINGS.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.433
ON 3. 1, 2--

13:20.467 --> 13:23.370
WAIT, WAIT. STOP, STOP,
STOP. WAIT, WAIT.

13:23.403 --> 13:24.371
HOLD ON. WAIT.

13:24.404 --> 13:27.941
OK, GO AHEAD.

13:27.975 --> 13:31.478
GET OUT OF HERE,
YOU STUPID DONKEYS!

13:31.511 --> 13:33.446
BRAD, CALM DOWN.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.181
I CAN'T.

13:34.214 --> 13:36.149
OK, WHAT DID YOU
AND GEEK BOY DO?

13:36.183 --> 13:39.386
DON'T TELL HIM. THIS WAS
OUR SPECIAL ADVENTURE.

13:39.419 --> 13:40.253
UCH, BRAD...

13:40.287 --> 13:42.956
IS THIS WHY YOU'VE BEEN
ACTING SO WEIRD?

13:42.990 --> 13:44.858
OK, LOOK, THE DONKEYS
WERE BEING EXPLOITED,

13:44.892 --> 13:48.628
AND I TRIED TO
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT,
BUT NOBODY WOULD LISTEN.

13:48.661 --> 13:52.232
OH, NOW WHO IS THIS?

13:52.265 --> 13:53.466
THIS IS BEULAH.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.402
OH...NICE GIRL.

13:55.435 --> 13:56.303
SISTER HELEN?

13:56.336 --> 13:58.939
ONE MOMENT, LILY.
SHE FAST?

13:58.972 --> 13:59.973
SHE'S SPUNKY.

14:00.007 --> 14:04.044
SO AM I. BEULAH WILL BE MINE.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.946
ALL RIGHT.

14:05.979 --> 14:06.914
SEE YOU LATER.

14:06.947 --> 14:09.149
SISTER HELEN, YOU CAN'T
GO THROUGH WITH THIS.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.051
IT'S CRUEL AND WRONG.

14:11.084 --> 14:12.019
LILY, I ASSURE YOU,

14:12.052 --> 14:14.621
THE ANIMALS WILL NOT
BE MISTREATED IN ANY WAY.

14:14.654 --> 14:17.357
SISTER BEATRICE WEIGHS,
LIKE, 300 POUNDS.

14:17.390 --> 14:20.560
LETTING HER RIDE A DONKEY
IS...IT'S UNCHRISTIAN.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.896
OH, REALLY?
HOW'S IT UNCHRISTIAN?

14:22.930 --> 14:27.034
JESUS WOULD NOT WANT PEOPLE
TO RIDE AROUND ON DONKEYS.

14:27.067 --> 14:29.436
HIS MOTHER RODE A DONKEY
INTO BETHLEHEM.

14:29.469 --> 14:30.570
PERHAPS YOU'VE HEARD THE STORY?

14:30.603 --> 14:34.007
YES, AND AFTER THAT,
GOD GAVE DONKEYS

14:34.041 --> 14:35.475
FREEDOM FROM LABOR.

14:35.508 --> 14:36.944
OH, DID HE?

14:36.977 --> 14:37.810
YES.

14:37.844 --> 14:39.980
AND WHERE IN THE BIBLE
DOES IT SAY THAT?

14:40.013 --> 14:46.253
IT'S IN THE BOOK OF...
JEBBA...DALAYA.

14:46.286 --> 14:47.254
JEBBADALAYA?

14:47.287 --> 14:50.523
HEY, I AM OUT THERE
TRYING TO DO GOD'S WORK, OK?

14:50.557 --> 14:52.525
I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO READ HIS BOOK.

14:52.559 --> 14:53.693
MMM...

14:53.726 --> 14:56.930
STILL DOESN'T EXPLAIN
WHY THERE'S A DONKEY
IN THE STREET.

14:56.964 --> 14:59.967
LOOK, I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO.

15:02.135 --> 15:06.006
COME ON, DONKEYS.
YOU'RE FREE. RUN AWAY.

15:06.039 --> 15:08.075
GO. FLY.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.242
I DON'T THINK THEY WANT TO.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.945
OH, IT'S BECAUSE
THEY THINK IT'S A TRICK.

15:11.979 --> 15:13.713
THEY'VE BEEN HURT
SO MANY TIMES.

15:13.746 --> 15:16.049
HEY, CUT IT OUT, DONKEY!

15:16.083 --> 15:18.685
GIMME THE SANDWICH.

15:19.219 --> 15:21.688
* AH-AH-AH

15:29.329 --> 15:31.131
GOOD DONKEYS!

15:31.164 --> 15:33.233
I WAS HUNGRY.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.038
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

15:38.071 --> 15:40.673
I JUST THOUGHT THAT THE DONKEYS
SHOULD, YOU KNOW,

15:40.707 --> 15:43.010
BE--BE RELEASED
BACK INTO THE WILD.

15:43.043 --> 15:46.113
THIS IS STATEN ISLAND.
THERE IS NO WILD.

15:46.146 --> 15:50.450
OK, YEAH, SO IT'S EASY TO SAY
THAT I WAS BEING STUPID NOW.

15:50.483 --> 15:51.151
YEAH, VERY EASY.

15:51.184 --> 15:53.086
THERE'S A DONKEY
IN YOUR YARD.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.454
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, DEAN-O,

15:54.487 --> 15:57.324
I'M SORRY THAT--THAT
YOU DON'T GIVE A DAMN

15:57.357 --> 15:58.525
ABOUT THE MANY CREATURES

15:58.558 --> 16:01.128
THAT WE SHARE
OUR EARTH WITH,

16:01.161 --> 16:02.195
BUT ME AND LILY DO.

16:02.229 --> 16:06.133
WE ARE BONDED TOGETHER
BY OUR PASSION
FOR ANIMALS...

16:06.566 --> 16:09.169
INCLUDING EACH OTHER.

16:09.202 --> 16:10.337
WHAT? BRAD.

16:10.370 --> 16:11.271
WE AREN'T ANYTHING.

16:11.304 --> 16:14.174
SO WHAT, WA-WAS THIS
JUST SOME KIND OF FLING?

16:14.207 --> 16:17.577
A FLING? WE BROKE
INTO A DONKEY TRAILER.

16:17.610 --> 16:20.747
WELL, I'LL NEVER
FORGET WHAT WE HAD.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.549
YOU NEVER
HAD ANYTHING!

16:22.582 --> 16:25.652
OH, JUST GO KEEP
TELLIN' YOURSELF THAT!

16:25.685 --> 16:28.155
AAH!

16:28.821 --> 16:30.090
ALL RIGHT.

16:30.123 --> 16:31.491
ALL RIGHT, BABY,

16:31.524 --> 16:33.193
AFTER ALL
I'VE BEEN THROUGH,

16:33.226 --> 16:35.195
THE LEAST YOU CAN DO

16:35.228 --> 16:36.463
IS TO TRY
THESE ON FOR ME.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.731
I'M NOT WEARING
STOLEN EARRINGS.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.333
THEY'RE NOT STOLEN.
I BOUGHT 'EM.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.035
FROM SOMEONE
WHO STOLE THEM.

16:42.069 --> 16:44.171
BOY, SHE'S REALLY
HARD TO SHOP FOR.

16:44.204 --> 16:45.538
EDDIE, ENOUGH!

16:45.572 --> 16:48.708
ENOUGH OUT OF YOU,
ALL RIGHT?

16:48.741 --> 16:49.542
TOUCHY.

16:49.576 --> 16:51.444
YEAH, I'M TOUCHY!
YOU GOT ME 100 HOURS

16:51.478 --> 16:52.812
OF COMMUNITY
SERVICE!

16:52.845 --> 16:57.150
I THINK YOU SHOULD
LOOK INWARD, MY BROTHER.

16:59.119 --> 17:00.487
THEREFORE, MY HONOR,

17:00.520 --> 17:02.055
IF, UH, MY CLIENT

17:02.089 --> 17:05.625
IS INDEED NOT A DE FACTO
DEFENDANT PER SE,

17:05.658 --> 17:07.494
THEN INDEED,
HE SHOULD NOT,

17:07.527 --> 17:09.129
INDEED HE MUST NOT--

17:09.162 --> 17:11.298
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

17:11.331 --> 17:13.100
OBJECTION, MY HONOR.

17:13.133 --> 17:15.135
YOU CAN'T OBJECT TO ME.

17:15.168 --> 17:16.269
SUSTAINED.

17:17.270 --> 17:18.338
UNH, UNH.

17:18.371 --> 17:19.038
I TOLD YOU HE'S GOOD.

17:19.072 --> 17:20.673
HE'S GOT HER
ON THE ROPES NOW.

17:20.707 --> 17:23.243
ARE YOU CRAZY?
THE MAN'S INCOHERENT.

17:23.276 --> 17:24.744
THEREFORE, I MUST
REMIND YOU--

17:24.777 --> 17:26.179
STOP. JUST STOP
TALKING NOW.

17:26.213 --> 17:29.082
NOW LOOK, SINCE
YOUR CLIENT
HAS NO PRIORS

17:29.116 --> 17:31.184
AND THE EVIDENCE
IS ONLY
CIRCUMSTANTIAL,

17:31.218 --> 17:32.819
I'M INCLINED
TO LET HIM OFF

17:32.852 --> 17:34.254
WITH $100 FINE.

17:34.287 --> 17:36.689
A FINE?

17:36.723 --> 17:40.593
MY HONOR, IF I MAY
REVIEW THE FACTS.

17:40.627 --> 17:42.195
WELL?

17:42.229 --> 17:43.062
WELL, WHAT?

17:43.096 --> 17:43.930
A THANK YOU WOULD BE NICE.
I DON'T KNOW.

17:43.963 --> 17:46.399
WHAT, YOU WANT ME
TO THANK YOU?

17:46.433 --> 17:49.369
OH, OK.
YOU KNOW WHAT, SEAN?

17:49.402 --> 17:50.370
I'M THROUGH WITH YOU.

17:50.403 --> 17:51.204
OH, YOU'RE
THROUGH WITH ME?

17:51.238 --> 17:52.239
YEAH.
OH, YOU'RE
THROUGH WITH ME?

17:52.272 --> 17:55.242
YEAH, I'M SICK AND TIRED
OF CLEANING UP AFTER YOU--

17:55.275 --> 17:57.177
I HELPED YOU
SAVE YOUR MARRIAGE,

17:57.210 --> 18:00.113
I FIND YOU HIGH QUALITY
MERCHANDISE

18:00.147 --> 18:01.514
AT AN EXCELLENT PRICE,

18:01.548 --> 18:03.583
I SPEND
MY SATURDAY AFTERNOON

18:03.616 --> 18:04.684
VISITING YOU IN JAIL,

18:04.717 --> 18:06.319
AND I HIRE YOU A LAWYER,

18:06.353 --> 18:08.288
A LAWYER WHO'S
BEEN ON TELEVISION,

18:08.321 --> 18:09.789
AND WHAT DO YOU DO?

18:09.822 --> 18:13.260
YOU SIT THERE LIKE
A FREAKIN' INGRATE.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.462
YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:15.495 --> 18:17.164
YOU'RE WELCOME.

18:17.197 --> 18:19.699
I'M GONNA
KILL YOU, EDDIE!

18:19.732 --> 18:20.900
I'M GONNA KILL YOU--

18:20.933 --> 18:22.235
BAILIFF! BAILIFF!

18:22.269 --> 18:24.804
YOU SHUT UP!
I'LL KILL YOU! I--

18:24.837 --> 18:26.339
AAH!

18:27.374 --> 18:29.642
I RECRUISE MYSELF,
MY HONOR.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.244
OH, GOD. OH, GOD.

18:31.278 --> 18:33.646
BETTER TAKE HIS BELT.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.548
YOU GOT 100 HOURS
OF COMMUNITY SERVICE

18:35.582 --> 18:37.284
FOR BEATING UP
YOUR OWN BROTHER?

18:37.317 --> 18:40.587
YEP, AND IT
WAS WORTH IT. YEAH.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.589
HEY, YOU KNOW, SEAN,

18:42.622 --> 18:45.692
YOU REALLY HURT ME,
YOU KNOW THAT?

18:45.725 --> 18:47.360
MY NECK WAS WRENCHED.

18:47.394 --> 18:49.629
I GOT, UH, LIMITED
RANGE MOTION

18:49.662 --> 18:51.431
IN MY SHOULDER.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.666
I ENDURED A LOT OF
EMOTIONAL DISTRESS.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.568
YOU'RE PREPARING
A LAWSUIT, AREN'T YOU?

18:55.602 --> 18:57.770
I'VE BEEN INSTRUCTED
NOT TO DISCUSS IT.

18:59.272 --> 19:02.242
ED, LOOK, OK, LOOK,
I'M SORRY, ALL RIGHT?

19:02.275 --> 19:04.244
I KNOW YOU WERE
TRYING TO HELP ME OUT,

19:04.277 --> 19:04.977
AND I--AND I--

19:05.011 --> 19:06.746
I--I SHOULDN'T
HAVE ATTACKED YOU.

19:06.779 --> 19:09.816
OK, THAT'S ALL
I WANTED TO HEAR.

19:09.849 --> 19:10.850
GOOD.

19:10.883 --> 19:14.221
IF--IF I GUY TRIES
TO SERVE YOU PAPERS
TOMORROW,

19:14.254 --> 19:15.755
JUST THROW 'EM AWAY.

19:17.624 --> 19:19.892
WOW. ALL THIS HAPPENED

19:19.926 --> 19:20.793
BECAUSE YOU
DIDN'T BELIEVE ME

19:20.827 --> 19:22.595
THAT I DIDN'T
WANT ANYTHING?

19:22.629 --> 19:23.530
THAT'S RIGHT.

19:23.563 --> 19:25.265
BECAUSE YOU DON'T TAKE
YOUR WIFE AT HER WORD.

19:25.298 --> 19:26.266
YEAH, I GET IT.

19:26.299 --> 19:28.668
YOU SHOULD'VE
GIVEN HER THE STOLE.

19:28.701 --> 19:29.369
WALT.

19:29.402 --> 19:32.205
EVERY WOMAN
SHOULD HAVE A FUR.

19:32.239 --> 19:35.642
IT COULD GIVE YOU
A LITTLE CLASS.

19:37.810 --> 19:40.213
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:40.247 --> 19:42.782
DAD--DAD, IT'S
TIME TO GO HOME.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.251
WHAT

19:44.284 --> 19:45.718
JUST GO. PLEASE.

19:45.752 --> 19:48.421
FINE. I'LL SAVE
THE STOLE FOR LILY.

19:48.455 --> 19:50.490
YEAH, TAKE IT.
IT'S IN THE CLOSET.

19:50.523 --> 19:55.295
I DON'T KNOW WHY EVERYBODY'S
BITIN' MY HEAD OFF.

19:56.296 --> 19:57.764
OH, HEY, LOOK. THIS FELL.

19:57.797 --> 20:00.433
OH, JUST--
JUST LEAVE IT.
I'LL GET IT LATER.

20:00.467 --> 20:02.669
ALL RIGHT.

20:03.336 --> 20:04.737
BABY, WHAT--

20:05.872 --> 20:07.407
WHAT IS THAT?
NOTHING.

20:07.440 --> 20:08.375
WHAT IS IT!

20:08.408 --> 20:11.678
OH, YEAH. I'M-A TICKLE.
TICKLE, TICKLE. WHOO!

20:11.711 --> 20:12.979
OH, MY GOD, CLAUDIA.

20:13.012 --> 20:16.015
OK, I MIGHT HAVE
GOTTEN YOU SOMETHING.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.584
OH, DIDN'T I MAKE IT CLEAR

20:17.617 --> 20:20.387
THAT WE'RE NOT TO BUY
EACH OTHER GIFTS THIS YEAR?

20:20.420 --> 20:21.053
YES, WELL, I DID,

20:21.087 --> 20:22.455
BUT THEN I JUST
ANTICIPATED

20:22.489 --> 20:24.324
THAT YOU MIGHT DO
SOME KIND OF DUMB THING

20:24.357 --> 20:25.925
LIKE GET ME A GIFT,
WHICH YOU DID,

20:25.958 --> 20:26.893
AND I DIDN'T WANT
TO BE CAUGHT WITHOUT,

20:26.926 --> 20:28.528
SO REALLY THE ONLY THING
YOU COULD BE MAD ABOUT

20:28.561 --> 20:31.331
WAS THAT I WAS RIGHT,
WHICH I WAS.

20:31.931 --> 20:35.268
WAS THAT AN APOLOGY?

20:36.336 --> 20:37.036
YES, SHUT UP.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.771
OK, LOOK I'LL SHUT UP

20:38.805 --> 20:41.808
IF YOU JUST TRY
THESE THINGS ON, PLEASE.

20:41.841 --> 20:44.311
OK. FINE.
OK.

20:44.344 --> 20:45.945
MAN, THEY'RE PRETTY.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.716
OH, MY GOD.

20:49.749 --> 20:52.419
OH, MY GOD!
THESE ARE AMAZING!

20:52.452 --> 20:53.786
YOU LOOK GREAT
IN THEM, TOO.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.722

THANK YOU, BABY.

20:55.755 --> 20:58.891
YOU'RE WELCOME, MAMA.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.760

21:00.793 --> 21:02.028
YOU KNOW, I AM JUST
SO HAPPY YOU'RE GLAD

21:02.061 --> 21:05.332
'CAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WENT THROUGH
TO GET THOSE THINGS.

21:05.365 --> 21:06.399
I KNOW. I KNOW,

21:06.433 --> 21:10.403
BUT WHEN THEY ARRESTED YOU,
DIDN'T THEY SEARCH YOU?

21:10.437 --> 21:11.304
YEAH.

21:11.338 --> 21:13.440
HOW COME THEY DIDN'T
FIND THE HOT DIAMONDS?

21:13.473 --> 21:16.443
YOU KNOW, I JUST, UH--

21:16.476 --> 21:18.511

GOING TO THE STATION,

21:19.979 --> 21:21.381
AND, YOU KNOW,

21:28.455 --> 21:31.491
OH! OH, GOD!
OH, GET 'EM OFF ME!

21:32.392 --> 21:35.362
CLAUDE, I WASHED THEM!

21:37.964 --> 21:39.766

PEANUT BUTTER FOR YOU!
