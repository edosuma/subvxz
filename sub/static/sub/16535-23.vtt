00:16.224 --> 00:18.396
Come in.

00:25.861 --> 00:27.929
Have a seat, Detective.

00:34.128 --> 00:35.261
The mom ID'd Pettigrew.

00:35.303 --> 00:37.212
He's got Derek Robbins.

00:37.331 --> 00:38.854
Bastard.

00:38.933 --> 00:40.266
Should we wait for Voight?

00:40.337 --> 00:42.181
There's a kid out there.

00:43.270 --> 00:45.972
Whoa, whoa, Erin. Your gun. Erin!

00:50.030 --> 00:51.330
What's going on, Detective?

00:51.364 --> 00:53.098
Where is he, you sick son of a bitch?

00:53.133 --> 00:56.001
- Who?
- Derek Robbins. Where is he?

00:56.036 --> 00:57.736
I'm sorry. I don't know who that is.

00:57.771 --> 00:59.281
- Where is he?
- I told you I would never

00:59.305 --> 01:01.106
hurt a child.

01:01.141 --> 01:03.342
Erin!

01:03.376 --> 01:08.347
You have three seconds to
tell me where Derek Robbins is.

01:08.381 --> 01:10.382
Erin, don't do this.

01:10.417 --> 01:12.484
Haley, get out!

01:15.922 --> 01:18.257
Give me a reason.

01:18.291 --> 01:20.359
Detective Lindsay.

01:22.796 --> 01:25.297
You admit to shoving your
fully loaded service weapon

01:25.331 --> 01:26.965
down the victim's throat?

01:27.000 --> 01:29.868
A repeat violent sexual offender

01:29.903 --> 01:31.770
who targets tender-age children.

01:31.805 --> 01:35.441
He knew the location
of a boy that he raped

01:35.475 --> 01:38.210
who we believed to be clinging to life.

01:38.244 --> 01:41.480
That boy is the one
and only victim here.

01:41.514 --> 01:44.750
I have spent my entire adult career

01:44.784 --> 01:48.220
training to sit across
from liars and scum

01:48.254 --> 01:49.822
and get the truth out of them,

01:49.856 --> 01:52.057
and I do not regret what I did here.

01:52.092 --> 01:55.294
What you did is official misconduct.

01:55.328 --> 01:57.396
You're looking at aggravated assault.

01:57.430 --> 01:59.231
I came here without an FOP rep.

01:59.265 --> 02:01.400
I've answered all
of your questions honestly.

02:01.434 --> 02:03.235
I know you'll look for inconsistencies

02:03.269 --> 02:04.770
when you interview Detective Upton.

02:04.804 --> 02:07.106
You will not find any.

02:07.140 --> 02:10.342
Until the board has made
its determination,

02:10.376 --> 02:12.111
you're stripped.

02:12.145 --> 02:15.481
You can take that badge off your chest.

02:33.133 --> 02:35.267
- Mom?
- Where are you?

02:35.301 --> 02:37.269
Um, I'm downtown. Why?

02:37.303 --> 02:39.371
I... I need you.
I need you to come here.

02:39.405 --> 02:41.774
I need you right now. I need you.

02:41.808 --> 02:44.943
This is really not a good time for me.

02:44.978 --> 02:46.812
He's... he's dead!

02:46.846 --> 02:51.817
I just got home and... and he...
I need you! Right now!

02:56.990 --> 02:58.290
- Bunny.
- Hank.

02:58.324 --> 02:59.475
- Where is he?
- Where's Erin?

02:59.499 --> 03:00.642
She's not coming, Bunny.

03:00.667 --> 03:01.971
- I want to see my daughter!
- Sit. Sit.

03:01.995 --> 03:02.895
- Where's Erin? I want to see her!
- Sit down.

03:02.929 --> 03:05.063
He's been shot.

03:05.088 --> 03:06.407
Jeez, it's Johnny.

03:06.432 --> 03:08.133
He's alive. Roll an ambo.

03:08.177 --> 03:10.478
- Hank, I did not do this!
- Get her back.

03:10.503 --> 03:11.617
I just came home,

03:11.642 --> 03:13.522
- and he was already shot!
- Just sit! Sit! Sit!

03:17.076 --> 03:19.578
5021 George, emergency,
got a male, white.

03:19.612 --> 03:21.824
Gunshot wound to the chest.
Roll an ambo to our location.

03:21.848 --> 03:24.216
- Is that Johnny Martelli?
- Yeah. Just keep her back out.

03:24.250 --> 03:26.118
Halstead, where's that ambo?

03:33.688 --> 03:35.355
Okay. Thanks.

03:35.834 --> 03:37.301
That was Dr. Choi.

03:37.374 --> 03:40.069
Guy's alive, barely.
Going into surgery now.

03:40.121 --> 03:42.205
Yeah. His name is Johnny Martelli.

03:42.239 --> 03:45.341
- You know him?
- Voight knows him from the Social Club.

03:45.376 --> 03:47.744
We're looking for a 9 millimeter.

03:47.778 --> 03:50.113
All right. Let's find that gun.

03:54.385 --> 03:57.053
Jeez, man. You going out of your mind?

03:57.271 --> 03:59.072
First you and Lindsay break up.
Now this?

03:59.097 --> 04:00.220
I wouldn't want to be here.

04:00.245 --> 04:01.500
I didn't know we had a choice.

04:01.525 --> 04:04.204
Let's get all the evidence we can.
We don't know what happened here.

04:04.228 --> 04:05.895
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:31.755 --> 04:33.389
Tech!

05:11.283 --> 05:13.150
You came home to find Johnny Martelli

05:13.185 --> 05:15.186
dying in your bed,
and you don't call 911?

05:15.220 --> 05:17.021
- You call your daughter?
- She's the police.

05:17.055 --> 05:18.355
She's not an ambulance.

05:18.390 --> 05:20.357
Meantime, he's bleeding out.

05:20.392 --> 05:21.569
Why don't you tell us
who Johnny is to you.

05:21.593 --> 05:23.194
Is he your new boyfriend?

05:23.228 --> 05:26.197
Johnny... we go way back. Grade school.

05:26.231 --> 05:27.575
I mean, nothing happened... you know.

05:27.599 --> 05:30.267
But then something happened, and...

05:30.302 --> 05:33.070
anyway, there's... he's not
who people say he is.

05:33.104 --> 05:35.039
A three-time convicted felon

05:35.073 --> 05:36.874
charged with multiple armed robberies?

05:36.908 --> 05:39.043
Well, he never brought that around me.

05:39.077 --> 05:41.545
He was fun.

05:41.580 --> 05:42.913
I thought he was the one.

05:42.948 --> 05:46.350
The one what?

05:46.384 --> 05:49.553
I mean, you haven't asked
how he's doing.

05:49.588 --> 05:53.224
Well... how's he doing?

05:53.258 --> 05:57.361
He's been shot in the chest!

05:57.395 --> 05:59.396
What I want to know is how does this fit

05:59.431 --> 06:01.966
into the scam
that you're running on Erin?

06:02.000 --> 06:04.134
- What scam?
- You tell me.

06:04.169 --> 06:06.203
You came around last week.
She's worried.

06:06.238 --> 06:08.305
She's talking about you saying
you're leaving town.

06:08.340 --> 06:10.040
What's going on?

06:10.075 --> 06:12.943
Hank, can we speak alone?

06:18.316 --> 06:21.151
There is no scam.

06:21.186 --> 06:22.997
He still has feelings
for my daughter, I think,

06:23.021 --> 06:25.256
and that's why he's taking it out on...

06:25.290 --> 06:26.490
he's taking it out on me.

06:26.525 --> 06:28.158
Thank you.

06:28.193 --> 06:31.595
Bunny, look at me.

06:35.500 --> 06:37.668
Did you do it?

06:37.702 --> 06:39.937
Shoot Johnny?

06:39.971 --> 06:43.974
No. No. Never in a million years.

06:44.009 --> 06:47.478
We found this in your
apartment behind the stove.

06:47.512 --> 06:50.481
That's his gun.
I didn't know it was there.

06:50.515 --> 06:53.284
I told him I hate guns. I detest them.

06:53.318 --> 06:58.022
Bunny, I've known Johnny as long as you.

06:58.056 --> 06:59.657
I mean, I figure
you got the inside track

06:59.691 --> 07:02.960
with you two shacking up.

07:02.994 --> 07:07.698
So, why don't you tell me right
now: What was he into?

07:07.732 --> 07:10.267
Who would've gone looking for
him at your place and done this?

07:10.302 --> 07:12.169
I don't know.

07:12.203 --> 07:14.204
He was good to me, Hank.

07:14.239 --> 07:16.974
I would tell you if I knew.

07:17.008 --> 07:20.511
Okay. Let's get real specific
about this morning.

07:22.480 --> 07:24.381
Where were you? Who saw you there?

07:24.416 --> 07:26.483
Why are you wasting your time

07:26.518 --> 07:29.119
when you could be out there
finding who shot Johnny?

07:29.154 --> 07:32.189
He's out there. You need to find him.

07:35.694 --> 07:37.628
Hold your roll, Detective.

07:40.198 --> 07:42.533
- You know about this?
- Yeah.

07:42.567 --> 07:45.169
Your mother's world record
streak of bad luck

07:45.203 --> 07:47.638
and crap timing is still going strong.

07:47.672 --> 07:49.673
But you don't want to go up there.

07:49.708 --> 07:51.542
I just want to help, okay?

07:51.576 --> 07:53.344
I'm not looking to cover for Bunny.

07:53.378 --> 07:56.180
Okay, not only shouldn't you
go up there, you can't.

07:56.214 --> 07:58.382
Per Chief Lugo, you can't palm in.

07:58.416 --> 08:00.651
If you want to disobey,
it's me chaperoning,

08:00.685 --> 08:02.686
and frankly I don't need the cardio.

08:02.721 --> 08:06.056
Erin, go home. Get your head straight.

08:06.091 --> 08:08.459
It's my mother.

08:12.797 --> 08:14.531
Mom, what happened?

08:14.566 --> 08:16.206
They think I shot Johnny
is what happened.

08:16.234 --> 08:17.701
All right, Bunny, you're free to go.

08:17.736 --> 08:19.503
Stay close. Keep your phone on, please.

08:19.537 --> 08:22.206
- Where were you?
- Don't make him say it twice.

08:22.240 --> 08:23.841
Jay, why don't you walk her down,

08:23.875 --> 08:25.386
then stop by Med,
see if you can get a statement

08:25.410 --> 08:27.311
out of Martelli.

08:30.749 --> 08:32.182
You're letting her go?

08:32.217 --> 08:33.616
No weapon. Alibi checks out.

08:33.652 --> 08:35.284
GSR came back negative.

08:35.320 --> 08:37.187
That doesn't mean she's not involved.

08:37.222 --> 08:38.722
Do you want me to lock your mom up?

08:38.756 --> 08:41.457
I don't want her to get away
with anything anymore.

08:41.493 --> 08:43.460
Erin, you can't be here.

08:43.495 --> 08:47.631
Till the board rules, the bosses
are looking at all of us.

08:47.666 --> 08:51.335
Just go home. Be smart.

08:55.340 --> 08:57.708
It's surgery. They're
pulling bullets out of the guy.

08:57.742 --> 08:59.543
It takes a minute.

08:59.577 --> 09:01.879
I know. It's just, um,

09:01.913 --> 09:05.783
there's a lot riding on this for Erin.

09:05.817 --> 09:08.452
Is she freaking out?

09:08.486 --> 09:10.387
I don't know. We didn't speak, really.

09:10.422 --> 09:13.257
I mean, we couldn't. It's so messed up.

09:13.291 --> 09:16.293
Jay, sorry, gunshot victim
didn't make it.

09:16.327 --> 09:20.097
Lost too much blood
before we could stabilize him.

09:20.131 --> 09:23.634
I'm gonna notify his sister
unless you'd rather do it.

09:23.668 --> 09:26.603
It's a homicide now, so I need
the time he was pronounced.

09:26.638 --> 09:28.305
I'll get the records.

09:28.339 --> 09:30.207
- Thanks, Choi.
- Yeah, man.

09:33.945 --> 09:37.314
I want you to give me the key
to Mom's safety deposit box.

09:37.348 --> 09:39.516
I'm gonna ask Erin to marry me.

09:39.551 --> 09:41.752
She's all I think about,
and she has been there for me

09:41.786 --> 09:43.487
every step of the way.

09:43.521 --> 09:44.822
Why now?

09:44.856 --> 09:47.458
You two aren't even together. Are you?

09:47.492 --> 09:50.360
No, we're not. But she's
in real trouble right now,

09:50.395 --> 09:51.635
and I want to be there for her.

09:51.663 --> 09:53.764
I blew it once, but I'm ready.

09:53.798 --> 09:55.933
Jay, this girl does not want
to be saved.

09:55.967 --> 09:58.469
Okay, what you should be doing
is putting some distance there.

09:58.503 --> 10:00.838
Two white male teens,
both found unconscious.

10:00.872 --> 10:02.639
Girl who called said it was oxy.

10:02.674 --> 10:04.508
We administered Narcan, pulled one out,

10:04.542 --> 10:06.310
but her friend's nonresponsive.

10:06.344 --> 10:09.646
- Bridgeport?
- Yeah. St. Joe's Prep.

10:09.681 --> 10:11.448
Two Bridgeport ODs yesterday, same deal.

10:11.483 --> 10:12.960
Kids thought they were taking
10 milligrams.

10:12.984 --> 10:14.218
Turned out to be 80.

10:14.252 --> 10:15.486
Well, there's more coming.

10:15.520 --> 10:18.622
Last count was these two plus nine.

10:18.656 --> 10:21.658
Go do your thing.

10:21.693 --> 10:23.327
Go.

10:27.665 --> 10:31.168
Johnny Martelli. 52 years old, healthy,

10:31.202 --> 10:32.703
until this morning.

10:32.737 --> 10:34.404
These bruises on his body... how recent?

10:34.439 --> 10:36.840
Fresh. 24 hours or less.

10:36.875 --> 10:38.675
So, crime of passion.

10:38.710 --> 10:40.811
Bad argument, Johnny says
the wrong thing,

10:40.845 --> 10:42.479
bang, bang.

10:42.514 --> 10:44.648
Yeah, I hate to disagree,

10:44.682 --> 10:46.550
but look at the powder stippling.

10:46.584 --> 10:49.486
Muzzle burns around the wounds.
Shot close-range.

10:49.521 --> 10:52.189
Direction of projectile
indicates shooting downwards.

10:52.223 --> 10:53.701
And under the body,
we found passive stains

10:53.725 --> 10:55.425
where gravity pooled the blood.

10:55.460 --> 10:57.861
He was laying down, probably
asleep when he was shot.

10:57.896 --> 10:59.363
This was premeditated.

10:59.397 --> 11:02.533
So, we'll rule out passion.

11:02.567 --> 11:04.501
But what's our motive?

11:07.405 --> 11:10.007
So, the bad news is
the slugs that we recovered

11:10.041 --> 11:11.542
out of Johnny Martelli

11:11.576 --> 11:12.920
don't match any guns in our database.

11:12.944 --> 11:14.545
They also don't match the gun

11:14.579 --> 11:16.213
that we recovered from the scene,

11:16.247 --> 11:17.625
which we also believe to be Martelli's.

11:17.649 --> 11:18.949
However, and more interestingly,

11:18.983 --> 11:20.784
the SIG we believe to be Martelli's

11:20.819 --> 11:22.419
did hit for another case,

11:22.453 --> 11:24.555
and that case involved this truck.

11:24.589 --> 11:27.291
It was robbed on Racine,
Back of the Yards.

11:27.325 --> 11:30.594
40,000 pills of codeine.
Two offenders wearing masks.

11:30.628 --> 11:32.362
The SIG was fired three times

11:32.397 --> 11:34.041
when the driver wouldn't get
out of the truck.

11:34.065 --> 11:36.300
I just came from Med, and kids are ODing

11:36.334 --> 11:37.734
and dropping all over Bridgeport,

11:37.769 --> 11:39.536
so whoever's selling them these pills,

11:39.571 --> 11:41.448
they got the dosage
of what they're selling wrong,

11:41.472 --> 11:43.417
and this robbery happened
about a mile from their school.

11:43.441 --> 11:44.985
Martelli's flooded his own neighborhood.

11:45.009 --> 11:46.743
So, how does that get him killed?

11:46.778 --> 11:49.379
Well, the driver said two gunmen, right?

11:49.414 --> 11:51.949
Where's the other guy?
Work Martelli's associates.

11:51.983 --> 11:53.750
Dump their phones.
Who was near the robbery?

11:53.785 --> 11:55.586
Where are they now? And I want to know

11:55.620 --> 11:57.654
how this robbery connects
to our homicide.

11:57.689 --> 11:59.489
Hey, boss, what about Bunny Fletcher?

11:59.524 --> 12:02.593
- Yeah. Get her back here.
- We can do that.

12:03.795 --> 12:05.896
Hey, Sarge has friends
in Bridgeport, right?

12:05.930 --> 12:08.765
Is this personal for him?

12:08.800 --> 12:11.268
That's the charitable description.

12:11.302 --> 12:13.503
Gang. Upton, you got a second?

12:13.538 --> 12:15.606
- I was just gonna...
- Sure you do. Come on.

12:23.648 --> 12:25.515
You're next at the Review Board.

12:25.550 --> 12:27.417
Yeah, that's right.

12:27.452 --> 12:28.863
It was just you and Lindsay
in that room.

12:28.887 --> 12:31.455
Just your recollection and hers.

12:31.489 --> 12:33.624
- And the offender.
- He doesn't matter anymore.

12:33.658 --> 12:36.660
They're gonna drive a wedge
between you and Lindsay.

12:36.694 --> 12:38.695
I've been to the Review Board before.

12:38.730 --> 12:40.964
Not when it's you and a friend of mine.

12:40.999 --> 12:43.300
Not with Intelligence.

12:43.334 --> 12:45.446
Some people in that tower
have a real bug up their ass

12:45.470 --> 12:48.605
for Hank Voight, and they see
Lindsay as his girl.

12:48.640 --> 12:51.808
You're the unknown quantity.

12:51.843 --> 12:54.878
I'm taking my FOP lawyer. We've prepped.

12:54.913 --> 12:56.980
Nothing's gonna bounce
on this unit or Lindsay.

12:57.015 --> 13:00.017
I'm not that kind of cop.

13:00.051 --> 13:01.952
Good.

13:01.986 --> 13:03.854
Then I came up here for nothing.

13:06.824 --> 13:08.859
There he is.

13:08.893 --> 13:11.962
Hey, Hank!

13:11.996 --> 13:13.563
I'm glad I caught you.

13:13.598 --> 13:15.532
Chief.

13:15.566 --> 13:17.701
Can't divulge the details
of Lindsay's hearing,

13:17.735 --> 13:21.571
but she put us all in a bind.

13:21.606 --> 13:24.041
Bottom line is I need a scalp.

13:24.075 --> 13:25.809
So, why the dog and pony show?

13:25.843 --> 13:28.045
You gonna boot her, go ahead and do it.

13:28.079 --> 13:30.580
This came from headquarters:

13:30.615 --> 13:34.651
Lindsay goes or I shut
Intelligence down.

13:34.686 --> 13:37.988
- You're asking my permission?
- I'm asking you to think.

13:38.022 --> 13:42.025
Lindsay's future or your unit?

13:42.060 --> 13:43.794
It's your call.

14:12.656 --> 14:15.492
All right, back off, Ricky.
That's enough.

14:22.399 --> 14:25.635
Ted, Carmine,
you think I want to be here?

14:25.669 --> 14:27.637
Come on. Don't lie to me.

14:27.685 --> 14:29.170
I wouldn't.

14:29.231 --> 14:31.673
We had nothing to do
with what happened to Johnny.

14:31.709 --> 14:34.511
He was part of our crew,
but it wasn't us.

14:34.545 --> 14:36.624
And the robbery?

14:37.414 --> 14:39.782
The load of painkillers?

14:39.817 --> 14:45.121
Look, I got his gun. It puts him
at the robbery of that truck.

14:45.156 --> 14:47.690
Did you give the okay?

14:50.561 --> 14:53.329
Martelli came to us, let us
know what was going down,

14:53.364 --> 14:57.700
and we... didn't stand in his way.

14:57.735 --> 14:59.702
And then somehow the plan went bad.

14:59.737 --> 15:02.505
Well, first, these morons brought guns.

15:02.540 --> 15:05.375
And absolutely not
did we give the go-ahead

15:05.409 --> 15:07.177
to sell this crap in the neighborhood.

15:07.211 --> 15:10.213
They didn't even know
what they were selling.

15:10.247 --> 15:13.750
I understand that your
grandson's in the hospital.

15:13.784 --> 15:18.354
Medically induced coma. Just turned 16.

15:18.389 --> 15:20.356
And the guy you were
tuning up? Who's that?

15:20.391 --> 15:21.591
Martelli's partner?

15:21.625 --> 15:24.427
Him? Yeah. Vincent Pollack.

15:24.461 --> 15:28.531
Northside punk. Lucky you walked in.

15:28.566 --> 15:32.101
No. You are, 'cause I got to
bring him back to the district.

15:32.136 --> 15:34.537
Now, I'll do everything I can
to keep your names out of this,

15:34.572 --> 15:36.606
but a lot of people are
watching this case.

15:36.640 --> 15:38.708
You better do more than try.

15:38.742 --> 15:42.478
What you owe us for Justin...
you still got to pay.

16:11.609 --> 16:13.587
- Feels like we're on the run.
- Yeah, well, Hank said

16:13.611 --> 16:16.279
to stay close, but my
apartment's a crime scene.

16:16.313 --> 16:18.314
They went through my panties.

16:18.349 --> 16:20.283
Where were you before?

16:20.317 --> 16:22.418
I'm on administrative leave.

16:22.453 --> 16:24.587
I was working a rough case,
and I went after a guy.

16:24.622 --> 16:26.589
I hurt him. Bad.

16:26.624 --> 16:29.892
Are you okay?

16:29.927 --> 16:31.794
I don't know.

16:34.431 --> 16:38.301
What happened between you
and Johnny Martelli?

16:38.335 --> 16:40.637
I'm not a cop. I may never be one again.

16:40.671 --> 16:42.272
Then why are you here?

16:42.306 --> 16:44.674
Because Intelligence will find out

16:44.708 --> 16:47.577
how you wound up
standing over your boyfriend.

16:47.611 --> 16:50.413
So, now it's time to get ahead of this.

16:50.447 --> 16:51.814
Okay, what if I were to tell you

16:51.849 --> 16:56.452
that this is bigger than you think?

16:56.487 --> 17:00.490
Tell me how, and I will try to help.

17:00.524 --> 17:02.925
You're not a cop?

17:02.960 --> 17:04.627
But you talk like a cop.

17:04.662 --> 17:06.628
And you're interrogating me like a cop.

17:06.664 --> 17:10.800
I want to know the truth
for once, okay? I deserve that.

17:10.834 --> 17:13.269
Okay. This is
about your father, isn't it?

17:13.304 --> 17:16.806
You think I didn't want to find him?

17:16.839 --> 17:19.509
I don't know what you want, Mom.

17:19.542 --> 17:21.477
I never have.

17:21.512 --> 17:23.378
You know what?

17:23.414 --> 17:26.348
I'll take my chances
with the actual police.

17:34.692 --> 17:36.826
- I want a doctor.
- You'll get one, Vince,

17:36.860 --> 17:38.500
the second you tell us
how Johnny Martelli

17:38.529 --> 17:39.829
wound up getting killed.

17:39.863 --> 17:42.432
Doctor!

17:45.903 --> 17:47.670
Eighteen overdoses. Two kids ID'd you

17:47.705 --> 17:49.706
as the guy who sold them these pills.

17:49.740 --> 17:51.351
Cell tower history puts you at
the scene of the truck robbery.

17:51.375 --> 17:53.176
You're cooked, buddy. Come on.

17:53.210 --> 17:55.345
You got all that on me,
but you can't place me

17:55.379 --> 17:56.846
anywhere near Martelli's murder.

17:56.880 --> 17:58.848
All right, so, then,
how did Martelli get killed?

17:58.882 --> 18:01.684
Fifty years on Earth as a guy
no one likes didn't help.

18:01.719 --> 18:04.687
Plus he was dealing, too.
But you know that.

18:04.722 --> 18:06.366
Yeah, we'll come back to that.
Bunny Fletcher...

18:06.390 --> 18:07.390
where does she fit in?

18:07.424 --> 18:08.725
We can't find her.

18:08.759 --> 18:10.360
- Bunny?
- Vince, one of two things

18:10.394 --> 18:11.728
is gonna happen:

18:11.762 --> 18:13.563
You're either gonna stop acting stupid,

18:13.597 --> 18:16.899
or you're gonna lose a lot more blood.

18:16.934 --> 18:18.601
Bunny Fletcher... it's her place

18:18.635 --> 18:20.536
where we found your friend bleeding out.

18:20.571 --> 18:22.205
Come on, buddy.

18:22.239 --> 18:25.608
A, I got no idea who killed Martelli.

18:25.642 --> 18:29.445
Maybe Carmine went to see him,
and Martelli talked back.

18:29.480 --> 18:33.383
As for Bunny,
she was sitting on the pills.

18:33.417 --> 18:35.618
Wait, wait, are you saying
this is all her?

18:35.652 --> 18:38.721
What? No. Johnny was dealing.

18:38.756 --> 18:42.558
I don't know how much he sold,
but a lot.

18:42.593 --> 18:45.027
Bunny's a bottom-feeder.

18:45.062 --> 18:47.730
Johnny stashed what he didn't
sell at her bar.

18:47.765 --> 18:49.866
She was due to get her end. Five grand.

18:49.900 --> 18:53.002
Am I good to see a doctor now, or what?

19:06.617 --> 19:08.050
Chicago PD!

19:08.085 --> 19:09.852
Bunny!

19:21.365 --> 19:23.733
I thought we tracked her
phone. I thought she was here.

19:23.767 --> 19:25.601
Pollack said the stuff was here.

19:25.636 --> 19:26.913
- You think she ran?
- Yeah. She ditched her phone

19:26.937 --> 19:28.638
and she took the drugs.

19:28.672 --> 19:30.706
Maybe. In the meantime,
let's toss this place.

19:34.645 --> 19:36.779
You go see Bunny?

19:36.814 --> 19:39.782
It's okay. You couldn't help yourself.

19:39.817 --> 19:41.350
She's still my mother.

19:41.385 --> 19:42.852
Yeah, and you're still the police.

19:42.886 --> 19:44.520
Where is she?

19:44.555 --> 19:47.790
- Did she move those drugs?
- What drugs?

19:47.825 --> 19:49.525
Fork in the road here, Erin.

19:49.560 --> 19:50.970
Either you're with me
or you're with Bunny.

19:50.994 --> 19:52.962
Hank, she said,

19:52.996 --> 19:54.997
"There's something bigger
going on here."

19:55.032 --> 19:58.334
She wouldn't say what. That is all.

20:00.671 --> 20:03.005
Her boyfriend stole 40,000 painkillers.

20:03.040 --> 20:04.807
They're missing,
and I think she's got them.

20:07.744 --> 20:10.112
- Okay.
- No. You have got to stay here.

20:10.147 --> 20:12.014
You can't keep me out of this.

20:12.049 --> 20:15.785
Erin, believe me when I tell
you I am doing this for you.

20:15.819 --> 20:17.720
We've got to be smart now.

20:17.754 --> 20:19.589
You understand?

20:21.358 --> 20:23.860
All right, come on. Bunny's associates.

20:23.894 --> 20:26.729
Anyone she might run her mouth to.

20:26.763 --> 20:29.432
You got to work fast.
She's in a lot of trouble.

20:43.714 --> 20:46.349
Glad to hear you're in Chicago.

20:46.383 --> 20:48.150
I'm not in Chicago.

20:48.185 --> 20:50.419
Been too long.

20:50.454 --> 20:51.998
You realize you're selling
damaged goods.

20:52.022 --> 20:54.657
Please. You were begging me last year.

20:54.691 --> 20:56.526
Now you're getting exactly what you want

20:56.560 --> 20:58.694
plus a major takedown
for the local office.

20:58.729 --> 21:02.865
Okay. I get a solid hire.
What do you get?

21:02.900 --> 21:05.968
A result. You in?

21:10.741 --> 21:12.608
This is Bunny Fletcher's
known associates,

21:12.643 --> 21:15.044
at least the ones that don't pop
in our system.

21:15.078 --> 21:16.979
Happy hunting.

21:30.594 --> 21:32.895
- Al?
- She bite?

21:32.930 --> 21:36.198
- Put it in play, anyway.
- So, what? You save the unit?

21:36.957 --> 21:39.121
If
Bunny Fletcher doesn't turn up,

21:39.176 --> 21:40.937
we're gonna need a whole new plan.

21:44.821 --> 21:46.406
Detective Upton is aware

21:46.431 --> 21:48.914
if she doesn't answer your questions,
she can be fired.

21:49.423 --> 21:50.823
She's here today to cooperate.

21:50.871 --> 21:52.658
We'd like the record to reflect that.

21:52.683 --> 21:54.269
Noted.

21:56.051 --> 21:59.171
Haley Upton,
made Detective meritoriously

21:59.208 --> 22:01.097
following actions of some heroism

22:01.122 --> 22:03.442
on an undercover assignment
whose details are opaque,

22:03.476 --> 22:05.077
even to this board.

22:05.111 --> 22:06.545
She's an exemplary police officer.

22:06.580 --> 22:08.380
Not finished.

22:08.415 --> 22:10.382
Not a month into your time
in Intelligence

22:10.417 --> 22:12.418
before you wind up here.

22:15.555 --> 22:17.389
I don't see how those facts are related.

22:17.424 --> 22:20.192
Relax. This won't take long.

22:23.396 --> 22:25.865
- 40,000 pills?
- Yeah, that's what was stolen.

22:25.899 --> 22:27.533
And we don't know how many got sold,

22:27.567 --> 22:30.769
so these are not gonna be
the last kids to OD.

22:30.804 --> 22:32.738
At least you guys get overtime.

22:35.342 --> 22:38.143
Mom's ring. She always said
it's not a race,

22:38.178 --> 22:40.579
but whoever meets the right girl
first gets the ring.

22:43.783 --> 22:46.619
Sure about this?

22:46.653 --> 22:48.587
You tell Dad?

22:48.622 --> 22:51.290
Why do I have to tell Dad?
It's Mom's ring. It's not his.

22:51.324 --> 22:52.591
Hey. What's up, doc?

22:52.626 --> 22:54.393
Hey, Kev.

22:58.598 --> 23:00.733
How'd it go with the Review Board?

23:00.767 --> 23:04.103
Not good.

23:04.137 --> 23:06.739
- They grill you?
- No. The opposite.

23:06.773 --> 23:09.775
Like they already made up their
mind that Lindsay was at fault.

23:09.809 --> 23:13.779
- They offer you a deal?
- Just released me.

23:13.813 --> 23:15.791
No disciplinary action
forthcoming, and they cancelled

23:15.815 --> 23:17.449
the interviews for the rest of the unit.

23:17.484 --> 23:19.785
Something else is going on.

23:19.819 --> 23:22.354
They're jerking us around.

23:22.389 --> 23:24.423
Sarge?

23:24.457 --> 23:25.791
I'm lost.

23:25.825 --> 23:28.794
We all are. Every last one of us.

23:28.828 --> 23:31.263
It's why we got to stick together.

23:31.298 --> 23:32.665
Detective.

23:43.843 --> 23:46.211
What?

23:47.714 --> 23:49.315
FBI! Don't move!

23:49.349 --> 23:50.916
Okay! What? What?

23:52.185 --> 23:54.253
FBI. Hands on the wheel, Bunny.

23:56.556 --> 23:58.824
What is this?

23:58.858 --> 24:00.492
You're our millionth customer.

24:07.734 --> 24:09.668
Umm...

24:09.703 --> 24:11.670
listen, my daughter's a cop.

24:11.705 --> 24:14.840
I think this is a misunderstanding.

24:14.874 --> 24:17.209
I sincerely doubt that.

24:17.243 --> 24:18.811
Get her out of here.

24:28.755 --> 24:32.691
Erin Lindsay. I'm FBI
Special Agent Jennifer Spencer.

24:32.726 --> 24:35.327
We're overdue for a chat.

24:35.362 --> 24:38.197
It's just me. I come in peace.

24:38.231 --> 24:40.265
The FBI usually does.

24:40.300 --> 24:44.370
Maybe we should talk inside.

24:44.404 --> 24:46.472
Do I have a choice?

24:55.582 --> 24:57.916
Some history at CPD.

24:57.951 --> 24:59.852
Time away for substance abuse,

24:59.886 --> 25:04.923
plus a DEA task force gig
that lasted all of two weeks.

25:04.958 --> 25:07.226
Now this interview gets away from you.

25:07.260 --> 25:09.294
That's still being investigated.

25:09.329 --> 25:11.563
You've been on our radar for a while.

25:11.598 --> 25:15.567
So, what? You're looking
into the Chicago Police?

25:15.602 --> 25:19.905
I'm not here about CPD.

25:19.939 --> 25:21.907
Every bullet point
on your resume makes you

25:21.941 --> 25:24.410
an ideal undercover.

25:24.444 --> 25:26.979
I'm with the New York
Counterterrorism Division.

25:27.013 --> 25:29.782
I'm here with a job offer.

25:29.816 --> 25:31.950
The FBI wants me?

25:31.985 --> 25:34.987
We tried to poach you before,
but your sergeant shut me down.

25:35.143 --> 25:37.589
He tells me your situation changed.

25:37.682 --> 25:39.491
It's a mild assessment.

25:39.526 --> 25:41.627
You'd report to me.
We take down major cases

25:41.675 --> 25:43.562
with zero jurisdictional boundaries.

25:43.596 --> 25:44.930
Big game hunting.

25:45.291 --> 25:46.632
In New York.

25:51.438 --> 25:53.663
I'd have to think about that.

25:54.474 --> 25:56.452
This is the call people wait
their whole life to get.

25:56.476 --> 25:59.011
I can't right now. My mother...

25:59.045 --> 26:02.347
I know all about your mother.

26:02.382 --> 26:05.084
Then you know she's in the wind.

26:05.118 --> 26:09.655
She's in FBI custody.

26:09.689 --> 26:13.215
CPD's gonna use your mom
to bounce you even harder.

26:13.460 --> 26:17.582
This is a two-fer.
Take the gig, save your mom.

26:17.664 --> 26:19.565
It's that simple.

26:43.733 --> 26:45.633
You have ten minutes.

26:48.394 --> 26:51.029
They're charging me
with a felony: Drug conspiracy.

26:51.063 --> 26:52.530
The FBI, Erin!

26:52.565 --> 26:55.340
Because they found you
in a truck full of drugs.

26:55.387 --> 26:58.310
I... I had to move them. I messed up.

26:58.337 --> 27:00.438
- Messed up?
- I tried to tell you.

27:00.473 --> 27:02.440
You did...

27:02.475 --> 27:05.009
You didn't tell me.

27:05.044 --> 27:08.480
And you didn't tell me
that Martelli beats you.

27:10.349 --> 27:13.685
Would you believe me?
Would it have changed anything?

27:16.422 --> 27:20.992
You feared for your life.

27:21.026 --> 27:23.628
He forced you to hide
his narcotics for him.

27:23.662 --> 27:25.630
Right?

27:25.664 --> 27:27.565
Right.

27:27.600 --> 27:29.634
Mom, if we are gonna make a deal here,

27:29.668 --> 27:32.370
I need every bit of leverage available,

27:32.404 --> 27:36.407
which means you have to tell me
the truth, for once.

27:36.442 --> 27:38.510
Okay.

27:38.544 --> 27:41.246
Johnny knew that the drugs
were on the truck,

27:41.280 --> 27:43.381
and he said I had to hide them,

27:43.415 --> 27:45.517
how nobody would come looking
for them in the bar.

27:45.551 --> 27:48.586
So, he forced you. He used you.

27:48.621 --> 27:50.722
You didn't plan this?

27:50.756 --> 27:54.259
They did say I would
make five grand, but...

27:54.293 --> 27:56.161
Mom!

27:56.195 --> 27:59.597
But then the kids got sick,
and Johnny was killed,

27:59.632 --> 28:01.599
and I think that's why...
because they blamed him.

28:01.634 --> 28:04.102
- Who did?
- His partners.

28:04.136 --> 28:06.738
Vincent something and Ian McAuliff.

28:06.772 --> 28:09.440
Night of the robbery,
Ian was the getaway driver.

28:09.475 --> 28:11.743
Maybe he's the one that killed Martelli.

28:11.777 --> 28:13.611
There were three men
who robbed that truck?

28:13.646 --> 28:15.213
Are you sure?

28:15.247 --> 28:16.681
I'm sure.

28:16.715 --> 28:19.450
I didn't tell Hank. I don't trust him.

28:19.485 --> 28:21.286
Would you testify against them?

28:21.320 --> 28:24.122
Yes. Yes. Just tell me
what to do; I'll do it.

28:28.060 --> 28:30.361
How did we get here?

28:33.165 --> 28:35.099
I'm gonna try to fix this, Mom.

28:37.570 --> 28:39.704
You're not gonna...

28:39.738 --> 28:41.773
you're not gonna see me for a while.

28:43.676 --> 28:45.677
I'll do what I can, Mom.

28:58.524 --> 29:01.459
Hey. Can we talk?

29:01.493 --> 29:03.361
Yeah.

29:05.030 --> 29:07.498
My mom's in custody.

29:07.533 --> 29:09.133
How? What district?

29:09.168 --> 29:11.636
It wasn't us. It's the FBI.

29:11.670 --> 29:14.138
They got a tip on the narcotics...

29:14.173 --> 29:15.773
the shipment her boyfriend stole.

29:15.808 --> 29:17.752
For someone not working
the case, you're up to speed.

29:17.776 --> 29:20.078
I tried to stay out of it.

29:20.112 --> 29:21.790
Look, it was three men
who robbed the truck.

29:21.814 --> 29:24.015
Driving was Ian McAuliff.

29:24.049 --> 29:26.818
That could be our shooter.
Man, she opened up.

29:26.852 --> 29:30.088
I guess getting pinched
by the FBI will do that to you.

29:30.122 --> 29:32.156
Go. Get McAuliff. I shouldn't be here.

29:46.405 --> 29:49.474
Ian McAuliff. Two years
in Statesville for agg assault.

29:49.508 --> 29:51.052
Three subsequent armed robbery arrests.

29:51.076 --> 29:53.044
Somehow never charged.

29:53.078 --> 29:55.546
All right, so now we know
Martelli's partner blamed him

29:55.581 --> 29:57.181
for when those kids OD'd.

29:57.216 --> 29:58.493
Said it was his plan, his problem.

29:58.517 --> 30:00.652
- That's motive.
- Yeah. Motive.

30:00.686 --> 30:02.553
All right, we move in with barrels up.

30:02.588 --> 30:04.489
This guy is a shooter.

30:23.442 --> 30:25.343
It's open.

30:30.215 --> 30:31.382
- Clear.
- Clear.

30:31.417 --> 30:32.583
- Clear.
- Yeah.

30:32.618 --> 30:34.452
Go. Clear.

30:36.722 --> 30:39.490
- Ruz, I got blood here.
- Yeah.

30:41.460 --> 30:42.760
Copy.

30:42.795 --> 30:44.696
Body!

30:46.799 --> 30:48.499
5021 emergency.

30:48.534 --> 30:51.602
Roll an ambulance to 6800 North Wayne.

30:51.637 --> 30:54.272
- Copy that, 5021.
- He's long gone.

30:54.306 --> 30:56.674
Yeah, cancel the ambulance.

30:56.709 --> 30:59.243
Roll the crime lab down here right now.

30:59.278 --> 31:02.580
5021 Sam. We got a bona fide
homicide. Roll in the crime lab.

31:02.614 --> 31:05.783
- Copy that, 5021.
- She knew.

31:05.818 --> 31:08.219
Bunny.

31:08.253 --> 31:11.222
I mean, she knew he was dead.

31:11.256 --> 31:13.858
So, what's her angle?
She sent us to collect a DOA.

31:13.892 --> 31:16.594
I don't know.

31:16.628 --> 31:18.229
All right, let's get
a timeline together.

31:18.263 --> 31:19.864
All right.

31:22.735 --> 31:24.369
At 9:00 a.m., Ian McAuliff

31:24.403 --> 31:26.371
takes one to the chest
and one to the head,

31:26.405 --> 31:28.383
and then ballistics matches
those shots to Martelli's gun

31:28.407 --> 31:29.818
that was found at the scene
of his murder.

31:29.842 --> 31:31.609
And we now have multiple accounts

31:31.643 --> 31:33.388
that the shots that killed
Martelli were fired

31:33.412 --> 31:35.213
at 11:00 a.m.
in Bunny Fletcher's apartment.

31:35.247 --> 31:36.624
All right, so that's plenty of time

31:36.648 --> 31:38.416
for Martelli to murder his partner

31:38.450 --> 31:41.219
and get back to Bunny
and get himself killed.

31:41.253 --> 31:43.454
Yeah. But by who? Pollack?

31:43.489 --> 31:45.823
No. His alibi rules him out.

31:45.858 --> 31:48.259
His alibi is that he was being beaten up

31:48.293 --> 31:50.795
by a couple of Carmine's guys.

31:50.829 --> 31:54.899
It's not our problem now.
FBI is taking the case.

31:54.933 --> 31:58.269
They secured 39,000 painkillers,

31:58.303 --> 31:59.804
and Bunny Fletcher has agreed

31:59.838 --> 32:02.306
to testify against Pollack
in the robbery.

32:02.341 --> 32:03.418
Are you saying we're just gonna sit out

32:03.442 --> 32:05.443
a murder investigation?

32:05.477 --> 32:07.545
I guess they'll look into that, too.

32:20.359 --> 32:21.926
I want the job.

32:21.960 --> 32:24.429
And here I was prepping my sales pitch.

32:24.463 --> 32:26.431
On one condition:

32:26.465 --> 32:29.200
My mother doesn't do time
on this narcotics beef.

32:29.234 --> 32:33.271
No charges, no paper
on her being detained.

32:33.305 --> 32:36.374
She gave up the real bad guys.
They used her.

32:36.408 --> 32:39.010
And she's not who you want.

32:39.044 --> 32:43.314
She gets released tonight, or I walk.

32:43.348 --> 32:46.884
You win. You get me.

32:46.919 --> 32:48.886
Let her go.

32:48.921 --> 32:50.955
This is the New York
Counterterrorism Division.

32:50.989 --> 32:54.139
We don't trick people
into working for us.

32:54.259 --> 32:57.312
We find someone we like,
and we go get them.

32:58.597 --> 33:00.531
She's my mother.

34:30.371 --> 34:32.442
What? You're my ride home?

34:33.585 --> 34:35.652
Will you give us a minute?

34:48.366 --> 34:52.402
You know, the one thing
we can't outrun is time.

34:54.304 --> 34:58.408
See, I figure you needed these
to load your gun,

34:58.883 --> 35:00.648
but then you forgot you had them on

35:00.673 --> 35:03.885
when you went into the next room
to shoot Johnny Martelli.

35:04.171 --> 35:05.916
I hate getting old.

35:06.280 --> 35:08.467
You start making mistakes.

35:09.131 --> 35:13.857
You didn't realize there was
minute blowback on the lenses,

35:14.264 --> 35:15.792
along with his blood.

35:15.827 --> 35:17.427
He beat me!

35:17.462 --> 35:19.231
He was gonna rob me.
He was gonna kill me.

35:19.356 --> 35:22.372
I'd love to ask him about that.

35:23.989 --> 35:27.704
You saw the biggest score of your life
just sitting there in your bar.

35:28.167 --> 35:30.516
Street value half a million.

35:30.551 --> 35:33.519
Kids start dying.
Your boyfriend spooked.

35:33.554 --> 35:36.689
You saw an angle.

35:36.724 --> 35:39.859
So, where'd you hide the weapon, Bunny?

35:39.893 --> 35:41.360
I've got a deal.

35:41.395 --> 35:43.696
Heh. You've got nothing.

35:43.731 --> 35:46.365
Erin has a deal, and it blows up

35:46.400 --> 35:48.701
as soon as these become evidence.

35:50.771 --> 35:54.006
Does she know?

35:54.041 --> 35:56.909
No one knows. No one can.

35:56.944 --> 36:00.646
Thank you.

36:02.950 --> 36:05.151
It's not like that.

36:07.421 --> 36:10.990
'Cause I promise you...

36:11.024 --> 36:15.428
the second you put her in jeopardy,

36:15.462 --> 36:17.029
I'm coming after you.

36:18.866 --> 36:21.501
I tried to be a good mother to her.

36:21.535 --> 36:25.037
I don't deserve this.

36:25.072 --> 36:27.540
Yeah. You're right. You don't.

37:16.957 --> 37:18.825
How long you been here?

37:18.859 --> 37:20.126
Long enough.

37:22.529 --> 37:24.797
They want me in New York,
like, yesterday.

37:26.133 --> 37:29.001
What I'm saying... I mean,
you know about this.

37:29.036 --> 37:33.172
You know about everything, right?

37:33.207 --> 37:36.742
I knew I needed to do something.

37:36.777 --> 37:38.288
I mean, they told me
in no uncertain terms

37:38.312 --> 37:40.947
they're coming after you.

37:40.981 --> 37:43.049
You needed options.

37:45.853 --> 37:49.188
You always thought you knew
what was best for me.

37:49.223 --> 37:52.558
Yeah.

37:55.996 --> 37:59.532
I gave this to Justin
to add to his dog tags

37:59.566 --> 38:01.834
when he shipped out.

38:01.869 --> 38:06.505
Just so he'd have something,

38:06.540 --> 38:08.741
knew I was there.

38:13.680 --> 38:15.581
Is this...

38:18.752 --> 38:20.820
Well, it's yours now.

38:31.899 --> 38:34.133
Did my mother do it?

38:38.672 --> 38:40.706
You know, I don't even want to know.

39:06.900 --> 39:08.801
Don't look back.

39:44.338 --> 39:46.238
- Thank you.
- Where is she?

39:46.273 --> 39:48.808
Yeah. You know what?
I texted both her and Burgess.

39:48.842 --> 39:51.043
Kim's on her way, but I never
heard back from Lindsay.

39:51.078 --> 39:53.312
I wonder if she heard back
from the board already.

39:53.347 --> 39:55.948
Maybe, but that's all the more
reason to celebrate, right?

39:55.983 --> 39:58.985
Yeah, or drown her sorrows.

39:59.019 --> 40:01.220
- Jeez.
- Sorry.

40:01.525 --> 40:03.533
I'm Greek. I see tragedy in everything.

40:03.611 --> 40:06.892
I thought you guys were
supposed to be fearless.

40:07.181 --> 40:10.262
Yeah. And on the streets,
I'd like to think I am,

40:10.297 --> 40:11.931
but the ivory tower... that place is

40:11.965 --> 40:14.226
like a minefield with an elevator.

40:14.334 --> 40:16.836
And any cop who thinks otherwise
is stupid or...

40:16.961 --> 40:18.671
Or what?

40:18.839 --> 40:21.273
Or stupid. Plain and simple.

40:21.367 --> 40:22.654
Okay.

40:23.529 --> 40:25.560
She'll be here.

40:25.779 --> 40:27.748
Yeah. Give me a minute.

40:27.948 --> 40:29.500
Copy a minute.

40:30.951 --> 40:33.319
That means a half hour.
