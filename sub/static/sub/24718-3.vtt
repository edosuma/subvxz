- <i>Previously on</i> Good Witch.
<i>- My dad used to bring me</i>

00:03.128 --> 00:04.795
<i>- gifts from his trips.
- Where?</i>

00:04.830 --> 00:06.730
<i>- London. That's the last time
I saw him.</i>

00:06.765 --> 00:08.432
<i>- The day that he left.
- She didn't say much,</i>

00:08.467 --> 00:10.734
but I could tell your daughter
was very happy to receive it.

00:10.769 --> 00:13.470
- I like to see you smile.
- You do?

00:13.505 --> 00:14.638
- Yeah.

00:14.673 --> 00:16.640
<i>- Who gave you that?
- Noah.</i>

00:16.675 --> 00:19.176
- That was nice of him.
- It was.

00:19.211 --> 00:21.945
- I love your mother very much.

00:21.981 --> 00:25.449
And I love you, and I wanted
to ask if it would be OK

00:25.484 --> 00:27.584
- if I married your mother.
- Yes.

00:27.620 --> 00:30.320
I'll get it.

00:34.860 --> 00:37.327
Dad...

00:37.363 --> 00:39.329
What are you doing here?

00:39.365 --> 00:41.498
- I wanted to see
my daughter.

00:41.533 --> 00:44.334
- It's been 22 years.

00:44.370 --> 00:46.336
- I know, Abby,
and when I left...

00:46.372 --> 00:48.972
- People call me Abigail now.

00:49.008 --> 00:50.440
- Abigail...

00:50.476 --> 00:53.810
of course. I've been thinking

00:53.846 --> 00:56.480
about what I wanted to say
to you for so long...

00:58.384 --> 01:01.378
but now, I... I don't know
where to begin.

01:08.227 --> 01:10.027
- What's going on?
- Who was at the door?

01:10.062 --> 01:13.363
I'm going to bed.

01:13.399 --> 01:16.033
- Everything OK?
- I don't know.

01:24.410 --> 01:27.311
<i>- Oh, there you go.
- Now you can eat here</i>

01:27.346 --> 01:29.413
or out in the garden.

01:32.418 --> 01:35.185
- Hey!
- Hey. Good morning.

01:35.220 --> 01:37.020
- Waffles?!
- Yeah.

01:37.056 --> 01:38.989
- I've seen fruit,
I've seen yogurt,

01:39.024 --> 01:41.091
- but I rarely have seen waffles.
- I am full of surprises.

01:41.126 --> 01:42.919
- Are they made with organic sweeteners

01:42.944 --> 01:44.895
and filled with some kind of wheat brand.

01:44.930 --> 01:48.065
- They are made with sugar
and filled with chocolate chips.

01:48.100 --> 01:50.067
- It is a surprise!
- Mm-hmm.

01:50.102 --> 01:51.902
- Hey, did you find out who came
to see Abigail last night?

01:51.937 --> 01:54.204
- No, and I haven't seen
her yet this morning.

01:54.239 --> 01:57.407
- Hmm. Is she OK?
- Yeah, she always seems to be,

01:57.443 --> 01:59.409
so she should be able
to handle the appearance

01:59.445 --> 02:02.579
- of one unexpected visitor.
- Morning!

02:02.614 --> 02:06.450
- Hey. Chocolate-chip waffles.
- Oooh!

02:06.485 --> 02:10.887
So, uh, I got an email about
the math competition finals.

02:10.923 --> 02:12.689
They're this weekend.

02:12.725 --> 02:15.258
I, uh, made it
into the regional championship.

02:15.294 --> 02:17.427
- Hey, congratulations!
- Grace, that's great!

02:17.463 --> 02:20.430
- Yeah. Uh, hey,
can you take me?

02:20.466 --> 02:23.100
- This weekend?
- Yeah, it's all day Saturday.

02:23.135 --> 02:25.936
- Actually, I have some guests
that I think are gonna need

02:25.971 --> 02:28.071
- some extra attention, but...
- I could take her.

02:28.107 --> 02:32.442
- Are you sure?
- I got all day free. Happy to.

02:32.478 --> 02:36.113
- OK. Uh, yeah. Great.

02:36.148 --> 02:38.782
- I will see you guys later.
- OK.

02:38.817 --> 02:40.550
- Bye!
- Bye.

02:40.586 --> 02:42.552
- Hey, I wanted one of those!
- These are for someone else,

02:42.588 --> 02:45.055
but there's plenty of fruit and yogurt.

02:45.090 --> 02:47.958
- But they're not filled
with chocolate chips.

02:54.199 --> 02:57.601
- Good morning. I was just
bringing this up to your room.

02:57.636 --> 03:01.571
- Chocolate-chip waffles. I used
to love those when I was a kid.

03:01.607 --> 03:04.141
- Did you?
- Uh, well, whoever came

03:04.176 --> 03:06.476
to see you last night
left this for you at the door.

03:07.296 --> 03:09.679
Has your name on the card.

03:12.518 --> 03:14.584
- It says "Abby"
on the card.

03:15.178 --> 03:16.486
- Yes.

03:16.522 --> 03:19.523
And I'm pretty sure I know
who used to call you that.

03:19.975 --> 03:23.660
- It's from my dad.
- I had a feeling.

03:23.695 --> 03:26.930
I didn't know he was even alive.

03:26.965 --> 03:30.500
- Yeah. It would probably be
easier if he wasn't.

03:31.194 --> 03:33.003
- Where has he been
all these years?

03:33.038 --> 03:36.306
- He didn't say
and I didn't ask.

03:39.745 --> 03:42.679
He wants me to meet him
for dinner tonight at 7.

03:44.049 --> 03:46.516
I don't show up,
I never have to see him again.

03:47.544 --> 03:49.453
- What are you gonna do?

04:34.600 --> 04:35.801
- Abby.

04:36.635 --> 04:38.136
Abigail.

04:38.604 --> 04:40.337
- Dad.

04:40.372 --> 04:42.539
- I didn't think
you were gonna show up.

04:42.574 --> 04:44.574
- Well, what girl can
turn down an invitation

04:44.610 --> 04:46.353
to have dinner with her father?

04:48.413 --> 04:50.580
- Uh, would you like
to order something?

04:50.616 --> 04:52.382
- No, thank you.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.486
I haven't decided how long I'm staying.

04:57.689 --> 05:01.291
- I thought of reaching out
so many times over the years.

05:01.326 --> 05:03.005
- But you didn't.

05:03.030 --> 05:04.329
- No.

05:05.397 --> 05:08.750
- And so I'm still wondering
why you left in the firstlace.

05:10.202 --> 05:13.704
- Because I decided
you'd be better off without me.

05:16.441 --> 05:19.609
You don't know me, Abigail.
You hardly ever did.

05:19.645 --> 05:21.978
- Whose fault is that?
- Mine.

05:22.014 --> 05:24.247
But you wouldn't have liked
the man that I was,

05:24.283 --> 05:26.917
and I wanted you to have a chance.

05:26.952 --> 05:30.053
So I took myself out of your life.

05:31.490 --> 05:35.625
And when your mother died,
I wanted to come back, but...

05:35.661 --> 05:38.295
- well, I couldn't.
- You chose not to.

05:38.330 --> 05:40.130
- Because...

05:40.165 --> 05:42.165
by then, I was in prison.

05:42.909 --> 05:45.635
I served eight years for business fraud,

05:45.671 --> 05:48.305
grand larceny and tax evasion.

05:50.375 --> 05:51.942
- They don't have phones
in jail?

05:51.977 --> 05:54.244
- At a certain point,

05:54.279 --> 05:56.246
I just didn't know what to say.

05:57.257 --> 05:59.115
- So what are you doing
here now?

05:59.151 --> 06:02.252
- Well, I've started putting
my life back in order.

06:02.287 --> 06:05.155
I'm almost done paying off
my old business partners.

06:06.224 --> 06:07.757
And I'm thinking about moving back

06:07.793 --> 06:10.327
into the old neighbourhood in New York.

06:10.362 --> 06:13.663
You know, the house we used
to live in is for sale.

06:13.699 --> 06:15.358
- The red one?

06:16.535 --> 06:19.369
- On Fernside?
- And I wanted you to know

06:19.404 --> 06:22.138
that things are different,
I am different,

06:22.174 --> 06:24.441
and I wanted you to see that.

06:24.476 --> 06:26.443
- So this is about you?

06:26.478 --> 06:29.646
- No.
- You just dropped in to let me

06:29.681 --> 06:31.815
know how wonderful you are now
and that you were right

06:31.850 --> 06:33.783
to run away from my life?

06:33.819 --> 06:35.712
- To say one more thing.

06:38.381 --> 06:40.021
I'm sorry.

06:59.411 --> 07:01.711
- Good morning!

07:01.747 --> 07:04.714
- Good morning.
- I came upstairs

07:04.750 --> 07:06.361
to let you know that breakfast
was ready, but it seemed

07:06.396 --> 07:09.219
- like you wanted to sleep in.
- Thanks for not waking us up.

07:09.254 --> 07:11.690
Those beds at Grey House are amazing!

07:11.726 --> 07:14.824
- Yeah. I haven't seen her
sleep this well in forever.

07:14.860 --> 07:16.559
- Which is one
of the many things

07:16.595 --> 07:18.728
we won't be able to do
once this baby comes,

07:18.764 --> 07:21.064
which is why we wanted to do
a babymoon while we still can.

07:21.099 --> 07:23.733
- Hm, smart. You're having
a boy or a girl?

07:24.177 --> 07:26.736
- We've decided not to tell.

07:26.772 --> 07:28.738
We want to keep it a secret
for as long as we can.

07:28.774 --> 07:29.989
- Then I won't ask again.

07:30.014 --> 07:32.175
Any ideas about what
you want to do today?

07:32.210 --> 07:35.945
- Mostly not think
about baby stuff. I mean,

07:35.981 --> 07:37.714
I can't wait for our child
to arrive, it's just

07:37.749 --> 07:40.617
I want to feel happy and relaxed
waiting for it to happen.

07:40.652 --> 07:43.253
- Erica! Look at this!

07:43.288 --> 07:46.423
<i>"101 Lessons From Dads Around The World."</i>

07:46.458 --> 07:48.402
- I'm sure that's great,

07:48.437 --> 07:51.695
but that's not the right kind
of reading for a babymoon.

07:51.730 --> 07:53.763
- Right.

07:53.799 --> 07:55.899
- But this looks interesting.

07:57.569 --> 08:00.236
- <i>"Hiking Trails of Middleton."</i>
- Yeah, there are a lot

08:00.272 --> 08:02.772
of wonderful places
around here to explore.

08:02.808 --> 08:05.809
- Before we have
to push a stroller around.

08:05.844 --> 08:07.944
- Thanks.
- Sure.

08:09.781 --> 08:13.116
- I'll take a few croissants -
plain and chocolate -

08:13.151 --> 08:16.795
half-dozen bagels and, uh,
just throw in an assortment

08:16.830 --> 08:18.930
of muffins, whatever you think
the ladies would like.

08:18.965 --> 08:21.224
- Oh! Well, I will
put in a variety.

08:21.259 --> 08:23.301
- And you'll bring it
to city hall, all of it,

08:23.336 --> 08:26.229
- before the meeting begins?
- I will get there early.

08:26.264 --> 08:29.808
- Excuse me.
- What's happening at city hall?

08:29.843 --> 08:31.176
- Oh, it's
the quarterly meeting

08:31.211 --> 08:33.244
of our Women's Small Business
Owners' association.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.395
- The mayor's in charge of all of that;

08:35.419 --> 08:37.347
I just show up with the pastries.

08:37.384 --> 08:39.317
- No, you also run
a very successful

08:39.352 --> 08:41.820
- small business of your own.
- Oh, well...

08:41.855 --> 08:43.006
- May I show you

08:43.041 --> 08:45.824
- my own small business owner?
- Oh, of course!

08:45.859 --> 08:48.259
This is one of Middleton's own

08:48.295 --> 08:51.863
- right when she was starting out.
- Well, isn't she adorable!

08:51.898 --> 08:53.798
- She begged to have
her own lemonade stand

08:53.834 --> 08:57.168
and made $14 without any help
from me or her mother.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.671
She just completely did it on her own.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.473
- That looks like Abigail.

09:01.508 --> 09:04.776
- Yeah. She was about
9 years old.

09:04.811 --> 09:06.878
Oh, I'm sorry. Arthur Pershing.

09:06.913 --> 09:09.280
You are Abigail's father!

09:09.316 --> 09:11.316
- That's right.
- She said you were dead!

09:11.351 --> 09:14.853
- Well, news of my dead has been
greatly exaggerated.

09:14.888 --> 09:18.189
- Have you seen Cassie yet?
- Arthur is related to Cassie.

09:18.225 --> 09:20.792
- He's her...
- Uncle by marriage.

09:20.827 --> 09:22.527
No, I'm taking things slow.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.363
I'm just trying to let everybody

09:25.398 --> 09:27.565
get used to the fact that I'm here.

09:27.601 --> 09:30.068
- Well, I'm very glad
that you introduced yourself

09:30.103 --> 09:32.237
because that photo

09:32.272 --> 09:34.239
of your daughter has given me

09:34.274 --> 09:37.008
the most wonderful idea!
Don't forget those pastries.

09:37.043 --> 09:39.878
Tata!

09:39.913 --> 09:42.647
- So, what does my daughter like
to order when she comes here?

09:42.682 --> 09:46.718
- Well, um, she loves
those pecan-cinnamon rolls.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.920
- Then, I'll take one of those.
- Coming right up.

09:48.955 --> 09:51.022
Hahaha!

09:51.057 --> 09:53.391
- Go. Oh!

09:53.426 --> 09:55.426
Yes! I feel like Dolley Madison

09:55.462 --> 09:57.395
fighting off the British army
in the White House.

09:57.430 --> 10:00.198
- Uh, one woman fought off
the entire British army?

10:00.233 --> 10:02.133
- Practically. She saved
Washington's portrait

10:02.169 --> 10:04.869
while the place was set on fire
and barely made it out alive.

10:04.905 --> 10:07.438
- Wow, you make her sound
like some sort of superhero.

10:07.474 --> 10:09.841
- A movie about her,
now that would make

10:09.876 --> 10:11.543
a lot of money.

10:11.578 --> 10:13.244
Oh, hey, Sam!

10:13.280 --> 10:15.180
You'd go see a movie
about Dolley Madison, right?

10:15.215 --> 10:17.882
- Depends. Who's in it?
- Amazement is in it.

10:17.918 --> 10:19.884
- Then... yeah.

10:21.324 --> 10:23.021
What time do you want to
leave in the morning?

10:23.056 --> 10:25.723
- I don't know. 8?

10:25.759 --> 10:26.813
Do you wanna go for
anything on the drive?

10:26.838 --> 10:27.926
Hmm, I'm good, thanks.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.024
I went online to see subjects
that might be covered this year.

10:30.049 --> 10:31.596
Not announced 'til each round.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.080
- They haven't done polygons in a while;

10:33.105 --> 10:34.566
Maybe you should be prepared for that.

10:34.601 --> 10:37.936
- Oh, I don't think I've ever seen
Grace not prepared for anything.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.469
- I'm pretty sure
we studied polygons

10:40.504 --> 10:41.783
- in freshman year.
- OK.

10:41.818 --> 10:45.276
- Thanks! Are you done
attacking me?

10:45.312 --> 10:47.946
- Yeah. I barely
made it out alive.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.317
<i>- Pinkies up
and pastries down,</i>

10:52.352 --> 10:55.954
ladies! This meeting
will now come to order.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.456
So, do any of you recognize

10:58.491 --> 11:01.926
this innocent, young politician to be?

11:01.962 --> 11:04.030
It's me!

11:04.065 --> 11:06.965
Bursting to take on the world!

11:07.000 --> 11:08.833
As soon as my skin clears up.

11:08.868 --> 11:11.202
But it's photos like this
that are going to inspire

11:11.238 --> 11:16.274
the next generation of Middleton's
women small business owners.

11:16.309 --> 11:17.809
- By showing them
what not to wear?

11:17.844 --> 11:21.179
- By revealing
from whence we came.

11:21.214 --> 11:23.648
So, I need all of you ladies

11:23.683 --> 11:26.517
to go home and pull out
your high-school portraits

11:26.553 --> 11:28.419
and display them in front
of your places of business

11:28.455 --> 11:31.990
alongside current photos,
which we'll take this week.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.659
Then today's youth can see
where you came from

11:34.694 --> 11:36.461
and who you are now.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.997
- It can be inspiring to know
what each of us overcame

11:39.032 --> 11:42.500
- to become who we are today.
- Isn't this a wonderful idea?

11:42.535 --> 11:45.970
And it all came from something
that Abigail's father showed me:

11:46.006 --> 11:49.841
A picture of her
with her very first business.

11:49.876 --> 11:53.011
- You met my father?
- Yes. He came into the Bistro.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.221
- He was very proud.

11:54.256 --> 11:57.015
Bragging to Martha and me
about your lemonade stand.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.784
- I'm shocked
he even remembered that.

11:59.819 --> 12:01.319
- So, I need

12:01.354 --> 12:03.521
a framed high-school portrait
from each of you.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.623
I suppose I could

12:05.659 --> 12:07.625
dig that out of wherever it is.

12:07.661 --> 12:10.342
- Me too.
- What if we don't have one?

12:10.377 --> 12:13.531
- Don't be silly. Everyone has
a yearbook photo at least.

12:15.368 --> 12:17.044
- All I wanted to do when I turned 18

12:17.069 --> 12:19.037
was move out of my foster parents' house.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.872
- I didn't realise

12:20.907 --> 12:22.874
- it was so bad for you.
- It was OK.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.909
I just was ready
to get started with life,

12:24.944 --> 12:27.045
so all I took with me
was a suitcase full of clothes.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.881
I don't have anything
from when I was a teenager.

12:31.356 --> 12:34.052
Other than the memories
of all the boys' hearts I broke.

12:34.087 --> 12:37.889
- Oh, now, you have some good memories
in Middleton to look back on.

12:38.658 --> 12:41.059
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Well, I still want

12:41.094 --> 12:42.264
a current photo of you,

12:42.289 --> 12:45.330
so don't let those frown lines
set in permanently before I can

12:45.365 --> 12:47.398
set you up with a photographer.
And sit up straight!

12:47.434 --> 12:50.902
"A sloping shoulder
makes ladies look older."

12:56.109 --> 12:59.043
- Thank you for taking Grace to
her math competition tomorrow.

12:59.079 --> 13:02.080
- Looking forward to it.
- I just hope she's ready for it.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.916
- Oh, yeah, she usually does OK.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.884
- Offered to help her
brush up on her geometry,

13:06.920 --> 13:08.920
- but she said she didn't need to.
- Oh. No.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.922
Don't take it too personally;
Grace has her own way

13:10.957 --> 13:13.925
- of doing things.
- Haha! I guess I just come

13:13.960 --> 13:16.361
from the overprepare-
and-then-do-a-little-bit-more

13:16.396 --> 13:19.097
- school of thought.
- Oh, really?

13:19.132 --> 13:21.265
- I hadn't noticed.
- Wait...

13:21.301 --> 13:23.301
Now, you're just making fun of me.

13:23.336 --> 13:26.571
- And at least,
you noticed that.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.413
<i>So what is all that stuff?</i>

13:35.448 --> 13:37.882
- This box got delivered
to the shop

13:37.917 --> 13:39.884
as I was locking up. Somebody moved

13:39.919 --> 13:42.120
into the last foster home I lived in

13:42.155 --> 13:43.955
and found all this
in the back of the attic.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.757
- And they sent it to you?
- That was nice.

13:45.792 --> 13:47.959
- Yeah, I never thought
I'd see any of this again.

13:47.994 --> 13:51.095
- Well, this must have gone
with some spiffy looking bike.

13:51.131 --> 13:53.097
- It was purple
and it had a banana seat.

13:53.133 --> 13:56.334
And I outgrew it pretty quick,
but I kept that to remember.

13:56.369 --> 13:59.203
- Mm-hmm.
- Dad kept saying

13:59.239 --> 14:02.607
he was gonna get me a 10-speed,
but he left before he did.

14:03.284 --> 14:04.798
- Did you take ballet?

14:04.833 --> 14:07.078
- No. Dad sent those

14:07.113 --> 14:09.180
from Paris. Was always sending
me stuff wherever he went.

14:09.215 --> 14:11.149
- Hmm, well, that was sweet.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.151
At least, you knew he was
always thinking about you.

14:13.186 --> 14:16.154
- And that's how I knew
he was never coming back.

14:17.006 --> 14:18.923
I mean, my mom told me,

14:18.958 --> 14:21.592
but it didn't seem real
until the gifts stopped coming.

14:21.628 --> 14:24.095
- Hmm. It must have been
hard on you.

14:24.130 --> 14:26.164
- Yeah. I made it through.

14:27.016 --> 14:28.099
- Are you ready to see

14:28.134 --> 14:30.334
what passed as fashionable
in the early 2000s?

14:30.370 --> 14:32.336
- Ohhh... All I remember

14:32.372 --> 14:34.672
are peasant tops and shiny pants.

14:34.707 --> 14:37.308
- Well, brace yourself
for disco halter tops.

14:37.343 --> 14:40.011
- Hmm...
- Wow!

14:40.046 --> 14:41.646
When was this?

14:41.681 --> 14:44.449
- Uh, homecoming.
- Now, which one's you?

14:44.484 --> 14:47.185
- Oh, I couldn't afford
to go to the dance.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.401
But the flowers are mine.

14:50.264 --> 14:51.956
I made corsages and sold them

14:51.991 --> 14:55.193
so I could afford a dress
for prom later that year.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.195
- Ah. Already
the businessperson.

14:57.839 --> 15:00.198
- I'll have you know
I previously made a killing

15:00.233 --> 15:02.166
- selling lemonade.
- Right.

15:02.202 --> 15:04.202
And just think, if you had been
able to go to that dance,

15:04.237 --> 15:06.971
you might not be as successful
as you are today.

15:07.006 --> 15:09.240
So, it seems like you learned
how to make lemonade

15:09.275 --> 15:11.242
out of lemons a lot.

15:12.186 --> 15:14.011
- Yeah, I guess I did.

15:22.330 --> 15:23.854
- I want to get that bridge
in the background.

15:23.855 --> 15:26.556
- Oh! No, no, no, no!
- Let's do it up there somewhere.

15:26.591 --> 15:28.825
I don't want to be
upstaged by the scenery.

15:29.579 --> 15:31.561
- Why do we have to have
our pictures taken?

15:31.596 --> 15:35.165
Because Martha wants us
to inspire the next generation.

15:35.200 --> 15:38.701
- Can't I just write a cheque?
- Cassie!

15:38.737 --> 15:42.238
- Hello! Erica, Clay,
you know my cousin Abigail?

15:42.274 --> 15:44.841
- Yes, we met at breakfast.
- And what did you get?

15:44.876 --> 15:46.843
- Some serving dishes. We went

15:46.878 --> 15:49.245
into this great pottery place,
which was right next

15:49.281 --> 15:51.247
to a kids' store I had to steer
my husband away from.

15:51.283 --> 15:54.184
- I can't help it.
- We're looking for a place to eat.

15:54.219 --> 15:56.252
- The Bistro's always
perfect for that.

15:56.288 --> 15:58.555
- We'll check it out. Thanks.

16:00.725 --> 16:02.959
- So, I spoke
with the photographer

16:02.994 --> 16:05.061
and she's pretty sure
that she can make the bags

16:05.096 --> 16:08.731
- under your eyes disappear.
- I have bags under my eyes?

16:08.767 --> 16:10.787
- Of course you do,
dear, we all do.

16:12.121 --> 16:14.904
Actually, you don't.

16:15.416 --> 16:18.374
And neither do you.
Honestly, why do I continue

16:18.410 --> 16:21.277
to live in a town where all
the women are so pretty?

16:25.593 --> 16:26.950
-<i> I'd like to congratulate</i>

16:26.985 --> 16:29.452
all the competitors who've
made it into the final round

16:29.488 --> 16:31.554
of today's competition.

16:31.590 --> 16:33.768
On the left is Grace Russell.

16:36.328 --> 16:39.762
Next to her is Melissa Coombs.

16:39.798 --> 16:41.764
And finally, Jacob Walker.

16:41.800 --> 16:44.334
Go get 'em, Jacob!

16:44.369 --> 16:47.074
- The topic of our
final round will be...

16:47.099 --> 16:50.306
polygons. First question.

16:50.342 --> 16:53.476
"A dodecagon is a polygon
with how many sides?"

16:53.512 --> 16:55.311
Grace Russell.

16:55.347 --> 16:57.313
- 12.
- That's correct.

16:57.349 --> 16:59.482
- Yeah!

16:59.518 --> 17:02.118
- I'll remind parents
to please refrain

17:02.153 --> 17:04.319
from showing any outbursts of support.

17:04.356 --> 17:06.321
Next question.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.625
"The sum of the interior angles
of a decagon

17:08.660 --> 17:11.961
is how many deg...?"
- 1440.

17:11.997 --> 17:13.829
- That's right!

17:13.865 --> 17:17.333
"If any angle
is greater than 180 degrees,

17:17.368 --> 17:19.102
then the polygon is called...?"

17:19.137 --> 17:22.305
- Concave.
- That's correct!

17:33.385 --> 17:35.451
<i>When did you move to Middleton?</i>

17:35.487 --> 17:37.453
- Oh, a long time ago.

17:37.489 --> 17:39.489
Grey House has been in my family forever.

17:39.524 --> 17:42.025
- I remember your mother
talking about it.

17:42.060 --> 17:44.961
- I wanted to put
some life back into it.

17:44.996 --> 17:48.364
- I think all the Merriwicks
would be very proud.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.367
It's a nice town, I can see why
my daughter chose to live here.

17:51.403 --> 17:53.469
- How are things
going with her?

17:53.505 --> 17:55.471
Have you been able
to see each other again?

17:55.507 --> 17:57.340
- Not since we met
for dinner.

17:57.375 --> 17:59.842
I told her I'd give her
some time, which turned out

17:59.878 --> 18:02.045
to be a lot harder for me
than I thought it would.

18:02.080 --> 18:05.214
But she didn't say that she
never wanted to see me again,

18:05.250 --> 18:07.717
so I'm just waiting to find out
if she ever does want

18:07.752 --> 18:11.387
to see me again.
These are very interesting.

18:11.423 --> 18:13.489
- Oh, yeah.
- A local artist makes them.

18:13.525 --> 18:16.392
Now, all the birthstones are represented.

18:16.428 --> 18:19.228
This one is your daughter's sign.

18:19.264 --> 18:20.541
- Ohhh...

18:21.600 --> 18:24.867
I remember so many great birthdays
when Abby was a little girl.

18:24.903 --> 18:26.869
Haha!

18:26.905 --> 18:28.871
I took her out when she turned 5,

18:28.907 --> 18:30.873
and I told her she could order
whatever she wants,

18:30.909 --> 18:33.242
which usually meant macaroni and cheese,

18:33.278 --> 18:36.546
but she wanted a whole, entire crab,

18:36.581 --> 18:38.581
and she was determined to eat every bite.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.883
It took her about two hours,
but she did it.

18:40.919 --> 18:43.886
- Abigail does tend
to finish what she starts.

18:43.922 --> 18:46.189
- She was a tenacious
little girl.

18:46.771 --> 18:47.757
I'll take it.

18:47.792 --> 18:50.593
- Oh, alright!
- I'll wrap it up for you.

18:50.629 --> 18:51.574
- Great!

18:57.636 --> 18:59.435
Taking a walk down memory lane, huh?

18:59.471 --> 19:02.205
- That's Abigail's.

19:02.240 --> 19:05.041
I am taking her senior photo
and having it scanned

19:05.076 --> 19:07.877
and framed for something
our mayor wants us to do.

19:09.481 --> 19:12.649
- Would you like to take a look?
- Oh, I'd love to.

19:12.684 --> 19:14.617
You know, I've never
seen her senior photo.

19:14.653 --> 19:18.488
Aaah... one of many things
I've missed out on.

19:19.600 --> 19:20.990
My little girl.

19:21.026 --> 19:24.427
- Yeah. She grew into the woman
she is today.

19:24.462 --> 19:28.297
- Hmm...
- Here you go.

19:28.333 --> 19:30.027
- Thanks.

19:31.002 --> 19:33.469
Could you maybe

19:33.505 --> 19:36.105
make me a copy of Abigail's photo?

19:36.742 --> 19:39.142
I'd love to have something
to put on the mantle.

19:39.177 --> 19:41.177
- I'd be happy to.

19:41.212 --> 19:43.479
In fact, why don't you stop by Grey House

19:43.515 --> 19:45.481
later tonight? You can pick it up there.

19:46.043 --> 19:49.152
- Cassie, you're as kind
as your mother was to me.

19:49.187 --> 19:53.089
- I've always believed
in the goodness of family.

20:02.200 --> 20:04.500
- Uh, I have been craving
strawberry cheesecake

20:04.536 --> 20:06.502
all morning. Do you have any of that?

20:06.538 --> 20:08.246
Well, I think I could
find a piece or two.

20:08.271 --> 20:09.672
Then make it two.

20:09.708 --> 20:11.607
One for each of us.

20:11.643 --> 20:14.610
- I'll bring it right over.
- But that's not what I wanted!

20:14.646 --> 20:16.072
- Kaitlyn, if you want to
tell me why you're sad,

20:16.097 --> 20:18.347
then we can try to get you what you want.

20:18.383 --> 20:21.350
- I don't like these with
ketchup; I want white sauce!

20:21.386 --> 20:24.179
- You want ranch dressing?
- Yes, please.

20:24.215 --> 20:25.708
- Excuse me.

20:27.225 --> 20:29.992
I hear that someone
might like some ranch dressing.

20:30.028 --> 20:33.196
- If you could.
- Coming right up.

20:33.231 --> 20:35.198
- Thank you.

20:35.801 --> 20:37.300
- So I guess that's us

20:37.335 --> 20:41.182
- in a few years, huh?
- Yeah, might be.

20:51.249 --> 20:53.382
- Do you think we all would have
been friends in high school?

20:53.418 --> 20:55.551
- Probably. What were you
into back then?

20:55.587 --> 20:57.854
- Mostly music theatre
and boys.

20:57.889 --> 21:00.223
But I got stuck playing
Aunt Eller in <i> Oklahoma</i>

21:00.258 --> 21:02.892
while all the boys pined
after Dream Laurey.

21:02.927 --> 21:05.928
- Hm. Well, it seems
like you were happy there.

21:05.964 --> 21:08.164
- Does it?
- All I remember

21:08.199 --> 21:10.099
about that day was that I flunked

21:10.135 --> 21:13.102
a project in art class
and I just stopped crying

21:13.138 --> 21:15.371
long enough for them
to snap this picture.

21:15.406 --> 21:17.073
I was trying to make a vase,

21:17.108 --> 21:19.075
but it turned out more like a kidney.

21:19.110 --> 21:22.578
- So I shouldn't hire you to be
a supplier for my store. Got it.

21:22.614 --> 21:24.747
- You know, I have
some old vases

21:24.783 --> 21:26.549
I was gonna put in storage.
I've wrapped them up,

21:26.584 --> 21:28.684
but if you want to stop by my
shop and take 'em to yours...

21:28.720 --> 21:30.898
- I never say no
to free merchandise.

21:31.723 --> 21:33.589
- Yoohoo!

21:33.625 --> 21:35.925
I have some wonderful news

21:35.960 --> 21:38.761
that can only be shared really
via the visual,

21:38.797 --> 21:41.097
so... voilà!

21:41.132 --> 21:44.267
And I wanted Abigail to be
one of the first to see it,

21:44.302 --> 21:47.103
since the announcement
was partly due to her.

21:47.138 --> 21:50.039
- What did I do?
- No, your father did this.

21:50.074 --> 21:52.608
He's donating 10 bikes just like that one

21:52.644 --> 21:54.277
to Middleton's girls in need

21:54.312 --> 21:57.580
all in the name of Abigail Pershing.

21:58.342 --> 22:01.700
- Well, isn't that nice of him.
- Oh, you say that as if

22:01.736 --> 22:02.838
it's not nice at all.

22:02.863 --> 22:04.387
- He's just trying to buy his
way into people liking him,

22:04.422 --> 22:06.322
which is what he always
used to do with me.

22:06.357 --> 22:08.624
- Well, he is here now,
and we have the 10-speeds

22:08.660 --> 22:11.060
- to prove it. Hahaha!
- Yeah. I mean, it couldn't

22:11.095 --> 22:13.262
have been easy for him
to come back the way he did.

22:13.298 --> 22:15.665
- You know what would have
been easier? If he never left.

22:15.700 --> 22:17.633
- Oh, he does seem
regretful about that.

22:17.669 --> 22:19.936
- I haven't seen much of that.

22:20.489 --> 22:22.572
- I would hope
if I ever had a rift

22:22.607 --> 22:24.807
with either of my children
that they would be

22:24.843 --> 22:28.080
open to letting me try to make up for it.

22:28.780 --> 22:30.646
- Yeah. Perhaps then,
you could have a future

22:30.682 --> 22:32.459
you never even imagined.

22:41.145 --> 22:44.180
- You're texting your mom?
- Noah.

22:45.115 --> 22:47.391
- Oh, make sure to tell him how
his girlfriend got first place.

22:47.912 --> 22:48.970
- Yeah.

22:49.005 --> 22:51.204
- Oh, you should send a picture
of the trophy to your mom.

22:51.205 --> 22:54.406
- She's seen me with trophies before.
- Come on, send her a picture.

22:54.442 --> 22:57.276
- Like, where is it?
- I left it there.

22:57.311 --> 22:59.712
- Oh! We can go back.
- Sam, we're almost home.

22:59.747 --> 23:03.382
- It's not far.
- It's just another trophy, OK?

23:03.417 --> 23:05.551
And who even cares about that?

23:30.150 --> 23:31.334
- Dad.

23:31.369 --> 23:33.479
- I've walked past this place
five times

23:33.514 --> 23:35.915
trying to get up the nerve
to come inside.

23:36.759 --> 23:38.717
- It's OK, you can come in.

23:40.488 --> 23:42.454
- This is a beautiful store.

23:43.030 --> 23:44.281
- Thank you.

23:45.115 --> 23:48.494
- I've been wanting to stop by
to see it... Well, to see you

23:49.036 --> 23:51.664
since dinner, but I thought

23:51.699 --> 23:55.401
you'd want some time
to get used to things.

23:55.436 --> 23:58.237
- Because it's not every day your
father comes back from the dead.

23:59.148 --> 24:00.973
- Did you really tell
people I died?

24:01.008 --> 24:03.475
- I got a couple of nice
condolence cards out of it too.

24:04.385 --> 24:07.813
- Well, I got you something
and not because of my debt,

24:07.848 --> 24:10.482
but because I was thinking about you.

24:23.331 --> 24:25.264
- It's my sign

24:25.299 --> 24:26.657
and my birthstone.

24:27.783 --> 24:29.410
It's beautiful.

24:30.911 --> 24:33.472
I guess I should thank you
for all the 10-speed bikes

24:33.507 --> 24:35.174
you donated in my name.

24:35.209 --> 24:37.843
- I wasn't there to give you one
when I should have, so...

24:38.335 --> 24:40.421
- I guess we can call it
the next best thing.

24:42.502 --> 24:43.770
Look what I've just found.

24:45.134 --> 24:48.008
It had been so long
since I saw one of my old ads.

24:48.043 --> 24:49.861
- Your work was in the papers?

24:49.886 --> 24:51.212
- My work was in a lot of places,

24:51.247 --> 24:53.851
but that's the one
that got me the most attention.

24:54.283 --> 24:56.983
I spent so much time
living in different places,

24:57.019 --> 24:59.252
dreaming about the perfect family,

24:59.288 --> 25:01.421
that idea came to me pretty quickly.

25:02.067 --> 25:05.237
- I wish I could have given you
a family like this.

25:06.295 --> 25:08.828
The kind that you deserved.

25:10.532 --> 25:13.379
So, uh, I don't know if you're free,

25:13.415 --> 25:15.825
but if you want to,

25:15.861 --> 25:18.338
maybe we could have dinner tonight.

25:19.376 --> 25:22.842
Catch up on more of what
you've been doing since I...

25:23.464 --> 25:25.779
Just sort of catch up.

25:26.550 --> 25:29.053
- Actually, I was gonna
see a movie tonight.

25:30.966 --> 25:34.501
- I understand.
- You've got other plans.

25:34.656 --> 25:36.435
- Do you want to come?

25:37.579 --> 25:39.188
- Oh, I'd love to.

25:40.495 --> 25:42.562
- They're playing <i> His Girl</i>
<i>Friday</i> at the theatre.

25:43.067 --> 25:44.698
- Cary Grant
and Rosalind Russell?

25:44.733 --> 25:48.364
- It's one of my favourites.
- Mine too.

26:00.667 --> 26:02.482
<i>- I don't understand
why you want to go home.</i>

26:02.517 --> 26:04.551
<i>I thought we were having
a really good time.</i>

26:05.172 --> 26:06.886
- I've been trying to,
but the more I try

26:06.922 --> 26:09.022
not to think about this baby,
the more I realise

26:09.057 --> 26:11.725
how terrified I am
about becoming a father.

26:11.760 --> 26:14.861
- You are going to be
a great dad.

26:14.896 --> 26:17.351
- But I don't know
how to actually be one.

26:18.633 --> 26:21.668
When that little girl started
whining at the Bistro...

26:23.805 --> 26:25.905
I started wondering
about what I would have done

26:25.941 --> 26:29.743
if I were her dad, and
I realised that I have no idea.

26:29.778 --> 26:33.613
Because my dad would have never
talked to me like that,

26:33.648 --> 26:37.417
because my dad hardly ever
said anything at all.

26:40.622 --> 26:43.189
- I just want to stay
for one more night.

26:43.225 --> 26:45.258
Cassie set out tea,

26:45.293 --> 26:47.961
and she said that there's
everything here we could want.

26:49.174 --> 26:50.764
And...

26:50.799 --> 26:52.799
I really like this bed.

26:55.137 --> 26:58.104
- Well, since we're probably not

26:58.140 --> 27:00.940
gonna get much sleep
over the next 18 years...

27:02.978 --> 27:04.690
- Thanks.

27:10.152 --> 27:12.118
- Thank you.

27:15.090 --> 27:17.490
Just give me a minute.
There's a few things

27:17.526 --> 27:19.659
I meant to water
before we left for the movie.

27:19.694 --> 27:22.062
- Take your time.
- No problem.

27:23.665 --> 27:27.434
You know I hadn't seen <i>His Girl Friday</i>

27:27.469 --> 27:29.736
- for a long time.
- Really? I watch it

27:29.771 --> 27:33.139
two or three times a year.
That and <i> The Philadelphia Story.</i>

27:33.175 --> 27:35.141
I love the way Cary Grant
and Jimmy Stewart

27:35.177 --> 27:37.143
fight over Katharine Hepburn.

27:37.179 --> 27:40.480
- Hahaha!
- Probably gave me a few ideas

27:40.515 --> 27:42.482
about how to get men to fight over me.

27:42.517 --> 27:45.585
- Abigail, please,
you're talking to your father.

27:45.620 --> 27:49.143
- Right, sorry.
- Just give me one minute.

27:49.178 --> 27:51.479
I have to water these guys in the back.

27:51.514 --> 27:53.538
- No problem.

28:16.852 --> 28:20.053
- All done! You ready?

28:20.088 --> 28:23.345
- Yeah. May I walk you home?

28:23.380 --> 28:25.992
- Uh, sure.

28:26.027 --> 28:27.523
After you.

28:40.408 --> 28:43.393
- OK, we got it.
- Now, can we go?

28:43.428 --> 28:44.831
- Just a minute.

28:45.881 --> 28:47.981
Didn't seem like you were
having very much fun today.

28:48.016 --> 28:50.550
- It was a competition.
- Why do you do it?

28:50.585 --> 28:52.986
- Because my teacher says

28:53.021 --> 28:55.488
that this kind of stuff looks
good on college applications.

28:55.524 --> 28:57.357
That's it?

28:58.195 --> 29:00.026
- Isn't that enough?

29:02.097 --> 29:05.398
- You know, I had a scholarship
for molecular biology

29:05.433 --> 29:07.400
when I went to college.

29:07.435 --> 29:09.402
I figured I'd end up
getting paid a lot of money

29:09.437 --> 29:11.404
to do research in a lab every day.

29:11.439 --> 29:14.941
And then one day, in the middle
of class, I realised...

29:15.654 --> 29:17.076
I don't want to do that.

29:17.614 --> 29:20.079
What I wanted to do was help sick people.

29:20.115 --> 29:22.081
Get to know them,
let them get to know me.

29:23.245 --> 29:24.884
It's why I just gave up the scholarship,

29:24.920 --> 29:26.753
changed my major.

29:26.788 --> 29:29.556
And it turned out to be one
of the best decisions of my life

29:29.591 --> 29:32.838
because I love doing what I'm doing.

29:35.931 --> 29:37.397
So...

29:37.432 --> 29:39.344
what about you, Grace?

29:41.303 --> 29:45.104
- What about me?
- What is it you love?

29:54.459 --> 29:56.359
- It looks perfect here!

29:56.394 --> 29:58.151
And it's gonna be so inspiring

29:58.187 --> 30:00.387
to all the future women of tomorrow.

30:00.388 --> 30:02.221
- I think those are
called girls.

30:02.256 --> 30:04.223
Potayto, potahto.

30:04.258 --> 30:06.191
- Oh! Hey there!
- Can I help you?

30:06.227 --> 30:08.527
- I'm here to pick up an order
of chicken fingers to go.

30:09.267 --> 30:10.863
- With ranch dressing?

30:10.898 --> 30:13.232
- You should probably put
some of that in there, yeah.

30:13.267 --> 30:16.402
I have them right here for you.

30:17.260 --> 30:18.704
There you go.

30:18.739 --> 30:21.540
- I think I know what I wanna be
when I grow up.

30:22.054 --> 30:24.243
- Would you like to own
a business someday?

30:24.278 --> 30:26.245
Maybe a restaurant like this?

30:26.280 --> 30:29.460
- No. I wanna run a flower shop.
- Oh!

30:29.496 --> 30:31.884
- Or maybe she'd like to be
something even better,

30:31.919 --> 30:34.386
- like the mayor.
- What do mayors do?

30:34.422 --> 30:36.555
- Well, mayors run the city

30:36.590 --> 30:39.258
and they get to cut ribbons
and make speeches.

30:39.293 --> 30:41.560
- Eek.
- "Eek"?

30:42.324 --> 30:45.364
- I wanna run a flower shop.
- Can I do that, Daddy?

30:45.399 --> 30:47.266
- You can do anything you want.

30:47.301 --> 30:50.269
Thank you. Come anytime.

30:50.304 --> 30:52.271
- Thanks.
- We will.

30:52.306 --> 30:55.941
- Well, would you look at that.

30:55.976 --> 30:59.278
Your idea is already inspiring
the women of tomorrow.

30:59.313 --> 31:01.580
- So it's a success.
- And you never know

31:01.615 --> 31:03.949
what kind of woman this little
girl might turn out to be.

31:03.984 --> 31:07.753
- Plenty of different paths.
- Mm-hmm.

31:14.628 --> 31:17.930
- Hmm... hello.
- Where have you been?

31:17.965 --> 31:22.303
- At the movies with my dad.
- Well, that sounds nice.

31:22.339 --> 31:24.700
- It really was.

31:25.105 --> 31:28.807
I never imagined it could be, but it was.

31:29.161 --> 31:31.628
- It was good of you
to let him back into your life.

31:31.663 --> 31:34.042
- Well, he came
all this way.

31:40.915 --> 31:42.259
Hello?

31:43.084 --> 31:44.553
This is Abigail.

31:46.588 --> 31:49.055
Why would they be checking
my credit score?

31:51.852 --> 31:54.560
No, that wasn't authorized at all.

31:57.098 --> 31:58.898
OK, thanks.

31:58.933 --> 32:01.108
Is everything OK?

32:01.842 --> 32:03.436
- No, that was
the fraud department

32:03.471 --> 32:05.738
at my bank. Someone asked
for a credit check,

32:05.774 --> 32:08.241
so they could put my name on a loan.

32:08.276 --> 32:10.009
- Why would anybody do that?

32:10.954 --> 32:13.246
- I know why my father
would do that.

32:14.374 --> 32:15.715
So he could clean me out

32:15.750 --> 32:18.003
and steal the rest of my life
from me too.

32:18.620 --> 32:20.953
Welcome back, Dad.

32:40.275 --> 32:42.027
- I like writing.

32:43.653 --> 32:45.197
And history.

32:46.481 --> 32:48.281
And I really liked

32:48.316 --> 32:50.283
working at your office
with your patients.

32:51.077 --> 32:53.786
And photography, I like that a lot.

32:53.822 --> 32:57.290
- Well, then do more of that.
- All of it, and just figure out

32:57.325 --> 32:59.292
what you like the best.

32:59.327 --> 33:01.294
- I kind of want
to go skydiving.

33:01.329 --> 33:03.296
- You want to jump out
of a perfectly good airplane?

33:03.331 --> 33:05.498
- Yeah. With a parachute
of course.

33:05.533 --> 33:08.301
- Yeah. I've always wanted
to do that too.

33:08.336 --> 33:10.236
But we both have to convince your mother.

33:10.271 --> 33:12.638
- And she's never
letting that happen.

33:12.674 --> 33:15.608
- Not in a million years.
- Mm-hmm.

33:21.683 --> 33:24.484
- Clay! Can I get
you something?

33:24.519 --> 33:26.486
- Is there an ice-cream shop
around here?

33:26.521 --> 33:28.488
- There are some nearby,

33:28.523 --> 33:30.323
but if you wanted to stay in,

33:30.358 --> 33:33.092
I have some ice cream in my
freezer. You can help yourself.

33:33.127 --> 33:35.094
- Aw, thanks, but Erica's
craving raspberry ripple.

33:35.129 --> 33:37.330
I can't imagine you'd stay stocked up

33:37.365 --> 33:40.377
- on something like that.
- Uh, hmm...

33:42.871 --> 33:46.205
- Yeah. Looks mostly like chocolate.
- Are you sure?

33:49.377 --> 33:52.237
- Raspberry ripple?! No way!
- Yep.

33:52.273 --> 33:56.048
There are bowls and spoons
right over there.

33:58.653 --> 34:01.153
- George told me
I could find you here.

34:01.189 --> 34:03.356
- Were you able to get
that photo of my daughter done?

34:03.391 --> 34:05.658
- I did. And I found

34:05.693 --> 34:07.660
the perfect frame for it in my store.

34:07.695 --> 34:10.161
- Is there anything else
I need to do?

34:11.833 --> 34:14.244
OK, thank you so much for your help.

34:19.373 --> 34:21.172
Did you try to put my name on a loan?

34:22.460 --> 34:24.417
- I did, yes.

34:26.005 --> 34:27.547
- Well, I cancelled
my credit cards

34:27.581 --> 34:29.514
and blocked all my accounts.

34:29.551 --> 34:31.572
You can't get to them now,
so don't even try.

34:32.034 --> 34:33.386
- What?!

34:33.420 --> 34:35.721
I wasn't trying to get to anything.

34:35.757 --> 34:38.391
I wanted to give you
something, as a gift.

34:38.426 --> 34:40.893
- Is that what they teach you
to say in prison?

34:40.929 --> 34:42.772
- Abigail...

34:43.431 --> 34:46.025
I wanted this to be a surprise,

34:46.434 --> 34:48.768
but I'm buying our old house.

34:49.237 --> 34:50.735
And I want to put your name

34:50.772 --> 34:53.539
on the loan so you'll be the co-owner.

34:53.574 --> 34:55.507
- You want
to give me a house?

34:55.543 --> 34:58.844
- Yes, the house you grew up in.
- The one you walked out of?!

35:00.624 --> 35:03.282
Stop trying to buy your way into my life,

35:03.318 --> 35:06.018
pretending to be my dad.
You gave up on being a father

35:06.054 --> 35:07.753
when you walked out the door
and never came back.

35:07.789 --> 35:10.423
- I thought I was doing
the right thing,

35:10.458 --> 35:13.392
so you'd turn out better
than someone like me.

35:13.428 --> 35:15.428
- You know what the right thing
would have been? If you actually

35:15.463 --> 35:18.264
tried to be a father. This guy
doesn't even think he's ready

35:18.299 --> 35:20.399
to be a dad, but he's already
put more effort in

35:20.435 --> 35:23.436
before his kid's born
than you did my entire life!

35:24.022 --> 35:25.538
- I know.

35:25.573 --> 35:27.150
And you're right.

35:27.675 --> 35:29.775
But I'm here now, and I'm trying

35:29.811 --> 35:32.864
- the best that I can.
- Well, it's too late.

35:33.615 --> 35:35.548
I thought I needed you,

35:35.583 --> 35:37.550
but I turned out just fine on my own.

35:38.370 --> 35:40.786
I started businesses,
and I used every bad thing

35:40.822 --> 35:43.589
that ever happened to me to my advantage.

35:43.625 --> 35:46.461
And when I think about
the person that I am today,

35:47.161 --> 35:48.894
maybe you were right:

35:48.930 --> 35:51.097
I was better off without you.

35:57.430 --> 35:58.738
- She made a good point.

35:58.773 --> 36:00.740
She never needed me.

36:00.775 --> 36:02.808
And that's one of the many reasons

36:02.844 --> 36:04.810
why I should never have come back.

36:05.563 --> 36:08.447
- Oh, wait.
- Before you leave,

36:09.275 --> 36:10.783
this is for you.

36:18.026 --> 36:20.126
- Thanks.

36:31.443 --> 36:33.577
<i>- I hope you'll come back
after your baby is born</i>

36:33.612 --> 36:35.845
- so I can know the whole family.
- We will.

36:35.881 --> 36:37.847
- And I'm gonna want
that exact same bed.

36:37.883 --> 36:40.217
- I will keep it open
just for you. Are you glad

36:40.252 --> 36:42.252
- you stayed the extra night?
- Glad you had the ice cream

36:42.287 --> 36:44.554
- she wanted too.
- Hmm... It's nice

36:44.590 --> 36:46.923
to know a man who realises he may not be

36:46.959 --> 36:49.693
a perfect father,
but knows he needs to try.

36:49.728 --> 36:51.828
It's the first thing
every little boy needs.

36:51.863 --> 36:53.997
How did you know

36:54.032 --> 36:56.533
- we were having a boy?
- We didn't tell anybody.

36:56.568 --> 36:58.483
- Didn't you? Hmmm...

36:58.518 --> 37:01.671
Oh, and I pulled this book
off the shelves.

37:01.707 --> 37:02.904
Made me think of you.

37:02.929 --> 37:05.242
- Clay's already read every
parenting book there is.

37:05.277 --> 37:07.911
- I think he might like
this one the best.

37:09.615 --> 37:11.514
<i>- "One Otter
and Twenty One Rabbits."</i>

37:11.550 --> 37:13.750
- It was one of
my daughter's favourites.

37:13.785 --> 37:16.253
We used to read it together and
laugh and laugh and not think

37:16.288 --> 37:18.955
- about anything else.
- What's it about?

37:19.554 --> 37:22.792
- It's about an otter
and 21 rabbits.

37:32.738 --> 37:36.273
What are you doing here?

37:36.308 --> 37:39.276
- I just wanted to tell you
that I'm leaving.

37:41.613 --> 37:44.547
- Because you're good at that?
- Because I didn't want

37:44.583 --> 37:47.384
to just disappear from your life again.

37:48.208 --> 37:49.552
I printed up

37:49.588 --> 37:51.421
a copy of the paperwork

37:51.456 --> 37:53.456
that shows you're not
on the loan for the house,

37:53.492 --> 37:56.259
- so you're free and clear of me.
- Are you really gonna go live

37:56.295 --> 37:58.461
in the exact same house
you walked out on me from?

37:58.497 --> 37:59.963
- I am,

37:59.998 --> 38:02.465
because it's the house
we brought you home to

38:02.501 --> 38:04.099
when you were born...

38:04.603 --> 38:07.804
and it's where I watched you
learn to walk,

38:07.839 --> 38:09.973
where you set up your lemonade stand.

38:11.272 --> 38:14.444
So it will give me a chance
to remember the good things

38:14.479 --> 38:16.846
instead of all the mistakes that I made.

38:18.684 --> 38:21.318
- Well, thanks
for this at least.

38:21.991 --> 38:23.987
- Thanks for coming
to dinner.

38:26.358 --> 38:29.207
And what you said
at Grey House was right.

38:29.828 --> 38:31.828
You didn't need me then,

38:31.863 --> 38:33.830
and you don't need me now.

38:35.213 --> 38:37.132
- Yeah, I turned out OK.

38:38.383 --> 38:39.836
- Any man would be proud

38:39.871 --> 38:41.719
to call you his daughter.

38:45.223 --> 38:46.843
- When are you moving in?

38:48.143 --> 38:49.564
- I don't know.

38:49.599 --> 38:51.229
A couple of months.

38:52.384 --> 38:54.440
- Maybe I'll come
see you sometime.

39:04.896 --> 39:07.453
I'm not saying
I'm not still mad at you...

39:08.667 --> 39:11.541
I'm just saying that people get older,

39:12.404 --> 39:14.804
they grow up and they change.

39:16.408 --> 39:18.408
And I'm not sure I want to get any older

39:18.443 --> 39:20.675
without having a father in my life.

39:22.114 --> 39:24.637
You're the only one I've got.

39:26.752 --> 39:29.886
- You really are a better person
than I ever could have raised.

39:31.757 --> 39:33.938
- Well, you had
something to do with it.

39:35.360 --> 39:38.234
- If you ever want to come back
to the house,

39:38.930 --> 39:40.445
let me know...

39:40.932 --> 39:44.234
and I'll make sure your room
is exactly how you want it.

39:46.038 --> 39:47.619
- Thanks, Dad.

39:49.574 --> 39:52.542
- It was good
seeing you, Abigail.

39:55.335 --> 39:57.213
- You can call me Abby.

40:28.313 --> 40:30.280
- I found a couple of ripe ones
out there.

40:30.315 --> 40:32.048
- Ooh, those look good!

40:32.083 --> 40:34.784
- Do you want me
to cut 'em into dodecagons?

40:34.820 --> 40:37.287
You're not the only one who
knows what a 12-sided figure is.

40:37.322 --> 40:39.489
- Maybe they should have
given you the trophy.

40:39.524 --> 40:41.645
Nah. You deserved it.

40:43.995 --> 40:46.963
- Hey.
- Hey! Dinner's ready

40:46.998 --> 40:48.609
- in 30 minutes.
- Great, thanks.

40:48.645 --> 40:51.801
- Nick's on his way.
- Did you ride a bike here?

40:51.837 --> 40:55.605
- It was a present.
- Something I always wanted.

40:57.480 --> 40:58.608
What are you making?

40:58.643 --> 41:01.978
- Ooh, mac and cheese!
- Yum!

41:03.379 --> 41:05.615
- When I was little, my mommy
let me crush up the breadcrumbs

41:05.650 --> 41:07.584
and sprinkle them on the top
before it went in the oven.

41:07.619 --> 41:11.287
- That's a good thing
we saved that job for you!

41:11.323 --> 41:14.539
- Crush away.
- I won't be needing that.

41:15.527 --> 41:18.127
We did things differently
in the Pershing house.

41:18.163 --> 41:19.996
Ooh!

41:20.031 --> 41:21.998
- That's how you do it to make
sure they're the right size.

41:22.033 --> 41:26.002
OK.

41:29.541 --> 41:31.808
- Yeah, that used
to happen a lot.
