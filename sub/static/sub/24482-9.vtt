00:11.219 --> 00:14.639
One week ago today, the Earth was struck
by a super bolide meteor

00:14.723 --> 00:17.726
at 9:37 Pacific Standard Time
on Christmas night.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.395
<i>I'm currently standing at the edge</i>
<i>of the quarantine zone...</i>

00:20.478 --> 00:21.521
It doesn't make sense.

00:21.604 --> 00:23.898
<i>You can see what was once</i>
<i>part of Canada's Yukon Territory...</i>

00:23.982 --> 00:25.066
What doesn't?

00:25.817 --> 00:28.528
We have satellites that are supposed
to detect these things.

00:29.279 --> 00:31.364
-We had warning.
-We had a few days.

00:31.448 --> 00:32.449
We should have had months.

00:32.741 --> 00:35.160
-Maybe it was moving too fast.

00:35.243 --> 00:37.912
-I didn't say it was a good theory.

00:37.996 --> 00:42.041
Couldn't radiation from it
have blinded our satellites?

00:44.502 --> 00:49.215
I suppose so. Nothing about how this has
behaved follows any of our models, so...

00:49.299 --> 00:50.550
What does that mean?

00:51.593 --> 00:56.765
When an NEO of this size breaks
through our atmosphere and makes impact,

00:56.848 --> 01:00.060
it... it shoots off hundreds of smaller
particulates back into the sky,

01:01.019 --> 01:04.147
making smaller meteorites
that eventually fall back to Earth,

01:04.230 --> 01:06.900
but there have been no reports
of additional fallout.

01:09.652 --> 01:12.864
Hey, Will, I love annoying sounds
as much as the next girl,

01:12.947 --> 01:16.284
-I'm just trying to contact Dad.

01:16.785 --> 01:19.871
He's out in the middle of all that.
I just want to make sure he's safe.

01:20.246 --> 01:22.999
He said that we wouldn't be able
to contact him for a while.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.083
On the phone.

01:24.167 --> 01:27.545
But he says if I use this
and make fast radio bursts...

01:28.296 --> 01:30.632
it can reach him no matter where he is.

01:31.633 --> 01:32.675
We set up this code.

01:36.638 --> 01:38.181
It means "Are you okay?"

01:39.265 --> 01:40.600
And then he answers back.

01:41.684 --> 01:44.646
And that way, we know he's safe.

01:45.188 --> 01:48.024
Sweetheart, his receiver
is probably just turned off.

01:48.108 --> 01:51.945
I'd probably turn my receiver off too,
if I had to hear the...

01:52.028 --> 01:53.321
Penny.

01:56.533 --> 01:57.534
Look...

01:59.494 --> 02:01.788
the frequency is probably just busy.

02:03.081 --> 02:05.083
There's a lot of bandwidth being used
right now.

02:05.166 --> 02:08.670
Hey. He'll respond. He always does.

02:10.380 --> 02:11.631
Just keep trying.

02:23.434 --> 02:25.645
No.

02:32.735 --> 02:34.946
Maybe it's the repeater.
I'm still adjusting.

02:35.029 --> 02:36.573
-Will.
-Or the wrong frequency.

02:36.656 --> 02:38.408
Will.
-Maybe the parabolic reflector's

02:38.491 --> 02:39.617
interfering with the signal.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.911
-You can't reach him.
-You don't know that.

02:43.037 --> 02:44.247
I saw it.

02:45.081 --> 02:47.417
What color was the explosion?
Was it red?

02:47.500 --> 02:49.586
Red could indicate
low temperature combustion,

02:49.669 --> 02:52.255
which proves parts of the ship
could still be intact.

02:52.380 --> 02:53.298
It wasn't red.

02:56.259 --> 02:58.094
Did you see any pieces fall to the ground?

02:58.178 --> 02:59.137
I don't know.

03:00.388 --> 03:02.348
Dad was wearing a suit.
He'd have oxygen.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.267
He could be fine.
We don't know for sure--

03:04.350 --> 03:06.186
Okay, but here's what we do know.

03:06.895 --> 03:09.814
Dad would not want us to be
focused on him right now.

03:11.399 --> 03:13.234
-He'd want us to find Mom.

03:13.943 --> 03:16.237
Dr. Smith could've taken her anywhere.

03:18.948 --> 03:19.991
Exactly.

03:21.326 --> 03:23.745
But the fact that she took her
tells us something.

03:23.828 --> 03:27.957
It means that Smith needs her.
We figure out why...

03:30.627 --> 03:32.212
and we'll know where to find them.

03:45.016 --> 03:46.434
Rise and shine, Maureen.

03:50.605 --> 03:51.856
Careful.

03:53.191 --> 03:54.859
You may have a concussion.

03:55.818 --> 03:59.989
What... What happened

04:04.577 --> 04:07.497
What happened to the Jupiter?
Where's John?

04:09.082 --> 04:11.834
There was... There was an accident.

04:13.086 --> 04:13.920
What? He...

04:18.258 --> 04:19.092
They didn't make it.

04:22.595 --> 04:25.473
I... I don't understand.

04:28.101 --> 04:31.604
I...
What did you do?

04:31.688 --> 04:35.275
The thing is... I needed your help.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.112
I just didn't know they needed it, too.

04:43.825 --> 04:47.620
I understand how you must feel
and I don't blame you,

04:47.704 --> 04:50.290
but we need to put the past behind us.

04:50.373 --> 04:51.708
Where are my children?

04:51.791 --> 04:55.253
Your children are fine.
I need you to focus, Maureen.

04:56.087 --> 04:58.923
The <i>Resolute</i> leaves in a matter of hours.

04:59.007 --> 05:03.803
If you have any hope
of saving your family, you will help me.

05:04.512 --> 05:05.596
Help you?

05:05.680 --> 05:08.349
The alien ship. Take me there.

05:08.850 --> 05:10.727
And I give you my word,

05:10.810 --> 05:14.480
I will get you and your children
off this dying rock.

05:18.776 --> 05:20.153
<i>How is that gonna help her?</i>

05:20.570 --> 05:24.574
I don't know... but she had it.

05:26.701 --> 05:28.036
The robot head?

05:28.578 --> 05:30.997
Yeah, she said she could bring him back.

05:31.080 --> 05:33.875
But why would she need Mom?
If anything, she would've needed you.

05:33.958 --> 05:37.545
Yeah, I agree, it doesn't add up.
There's gotta be more to it.

05:37.628 --> 05:38.838
Where are you going?

05:38.921 --> 05:41.007
Sitting here doesn't help.
They can't have gone far.

05:41.382 --> 05:43.551
Wait. I'm coming with you.

05:43.634 --> 05:46.262
Just stay here.
-But I can help.

05:46.345 --> 05:47.555
No! You've done enough!

05:54.353 --> 05:58.149
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
I didn't... I didn't mean that.

05:58.232 --> 05:59.067
No.

06:01.319 --> 06:05.698
You're right. It's my fault.
I let her out.

06:06.908 --> 06:08.785
It's okay. Go.

07:34.162 --> 07:35.037
Guys!

07:38.791 --> 07:40.626
Hey, what's going on?

07:46.048 --> 07:47.800
Yeah. It's the rock from the cave.

07:47.884 --> 07:50.887
Thing is, I don't think it's a rock.

07:51.679 --> 07:53.055
Then what is it?

07:55.349 --> 07:57.894
Highly concentrated biomass.

07:57.977 --> 08:00.229
So, petrified super poop?

08:00.313 --> 08:02.148
Uh, yes, exactly.

08:02.231 --> 08:04.734
Okay. Excuse me, I'm washing my hands now.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.820
-I was thinking--
-The waste converters.

08:08.362 --> 08:11.908
Every Jupiter has one. And since it can
turn human waste into biofuel--

08:11.991 --> 08:13.034
It is possible.

08:13.117 --> 08:15.328
Didn't Mom say it would take
at least three years

08:15.411 --> 08:17.205
to produce enough waste
to launch a Jupiter?

08:17.288 --> 08:19.040
Uh, yeah, but we don't have to produce it.

08:19.123 --> 08:21.751
Whatever's been living in that cave
has been doing it forever.

08:21.834 --> 08:22.710
Just so I'm clear,

08:22.793 --> 08:25.755
we spent the night in what is,
essentially, an alien toilet?

08:26.130 --> 08:29.175
You better hope that whoever used it
is no longer there.

08:30.009 --> 08:33.262
This sample contains digested material
from every creature

08:33.346 --> 08:35.348
I've logged on this planet.

08:36.599 --> 08:41.771
Whatever created it, it's from the top
of the food chain. An apex predator.

08:49.278 --> 08:52.490
Anybody got a better idea?
The <i>Resolute</i> leaves in nine hours.

08:52.573 --> 08:54.909
-Dad may not even have that long.
Will.

08:59.080 --> 09:02.124
Let's get on the radio.
We'll need all the help we can get.

09:03.292 --> 09:07.255
All right. While you guys work on that,
I'm gonna go find Mom.

09:07.338 --> 09:11.008
Wait, please, it's dangerous.
Your mother would want you to stay here.

09:13.052 --> 09:16.389
Well, then I guess it's a good thing
I take after my dad.

09:21.269 --> 09:24.981
-Okay. It's okay.
Judy, wait.

09:25.064 --> 09:27.316
Tell Hiroki I'm taking his Chariot.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.570
Okay, but can you just...
Can you... Okay...

09:32.530 --> 09:33.990
Hey, what?

09:35.866 --> 09:38.744
-Penny, I'm--

09:38.828 --> 09:42.832
-Yes, I promise.

09:48.963 --> 09:51.882
Hey. Hey.

09:52.925 --> 09:56.429
You're not losing anyone else today.
Understand?

09:58.431 --> 10:00.141
Are you sure
that you can handle this alone?

10:01.267 --> 10:02.435
Don't worry.

10:03.185 --> 10:04.729
I'm not gonna be alone.

10:07.940 --> 10:10.526
The damage looks worse
than it did in the video.

10:11.152 --> 10:15.448
Was that your big plan?
Fix the ship and fly away?

10:16.115 --> 10:21.037
Oh, please, I wouldn't have
any idea how to do that, but he might.

10:23.247 --> 10:27.793
In Will's video,
the ship was making a sound

10:28.377 --> 10:30.296
and the robot responding to it,

10:30.379 --> 10:33.758
like it was recharging his batteries,

10:34.759 --> 10:36.385
bringing it back to life.

10:37.762 --> 10:41.599
Like Humpty Dumpty,
Will put the robot back together again,

10:42.183 --> 10:44.644
and when he did, it somehow...

10:46.812 --> 10:48.105
healed itself.

10:49.315 --> 10:53.736
If used properly,
I believe this magnificent machine

10:54.654 --> 10:55.821
could heal us all.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.200
But first things first.

11:13.005 --> 11:16.175
I don't understand.
I'm doing exactly what Will did.

11:16.926 --> 11:18.135
But you're not Will.

11:19.095 --> 11:21.180
Will is kind, compassionate. You're--

11:21.263 --> 11:24.016
Maureen, no matter what you think of me...

11:25.434 --> 11:27.311
I never meant to hurt anyone.

11:27.895 --> 11:31.399
I just wanted to get to Alpha Centauri
for a fresh start.

11:31.482 --> 11:33.734
Just like you. Just like John.

11:34.318 --> 11:36.487
We're not so different, you know.

11:37.446 --> 11:43.285
Just two people trying to atone
for our mistakes, heal old wounds.

11:44.370 --> 11:47.164
So whatever you think of me
and the things that I've done...

11:47.832 --> 11:49.166
I'm not a monster.

12:00.845 --> 12:01.804
It's this way.

12:06.434 --> 12:08.561
I don't remember it being this warm.

12:19.113 --> 12:22.658
-I think we'll need a lot more.

12:29.123 --> 12:30.708
What about over here?

12:31.792 --> 12:33.919
I don't know.
We only went this far.

13:27.014 --> 13:29.308
Is there enough down there?
-Let's find out.

13:41.570 --> 13:43.489
Whoa. Incredible.

13:44.490 --> 13:47.117
We are, literally, full of shit.

13:49.745 --> 13:52.122
Looks like we're alone.
That's a good start.

13:55.459 --> 13:56.919
Should we take a closer look?

13:59.380 --> 14:00.631
Yeah.

14:01.966 --> 14:04.218
Stay here. Just in case.

14:41.213 --> 14:42.089
What is it?

14:43.257 --> 14:44.258
It's fresh.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.768
Should we bring everybody else in?

15:13.120 --> 15:15.664
So, there's some good news
and some bad news.

15:16.498 --> 15:18.500
The good news
is there's enough biomass

15:18.584 --> 15:20.461
to get all our Jupiters off this planet.

15:20.544 --> 15:21.670
And the bad news?

15:22.296 --> 15:24.465
We have to break it apart
and haul it out of there

15:24.548 --> 15:27.259
-without making a sound.
-But that's impossible.

15:27.343 --> 15:30.095
I don't understand.
Why do we have to be so quiet?

15:31.972 --> 15:35.643
Right. Well, there's some, uh...
some worse news.

15:38.562 --> 15:41.649
Maybe the problem isn't the robot,
it's the ship.

15:43.525 --> 15:46.445
Listen, why don't you untie me
and I can help you figure it out.

15:46.862 --> 15:49.865
-We'll go in the ship--

15:49.949 --> 15:54.328
I think that you are a lot of things,
but stupid is not one of them.

15:56.455 --> 16:01.085
You got me to believe you were a doctor.
Got me to invite you into my family.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.755
You made me think we were friends.

16:06.548 --> 16:08.884
If you're stupid,
I don't know what that makes me.

16:09.468 --> 16:13.347
Don't be hard on yourself.
I'm pretty good at what I do.

16:13.430 --> 16:16.392
So am I. And I'm a rocket scientist.

16:16.475 --> 16:18.310
This is alien technology.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.896
No. The laws of thermodynamics
are universal.

16:21.438 --> 16:22.940
Energy, entropy...

16:23.023 --> 16:25.484
If there is anyone on this planet

16:25.567 --> 16:29.279
that can figure out
how to turn that ship on, it's me.

16:30.906 --> 16:34.785
We always said, if there was anyone
who could help us figure this out,

16:34.868 --> 16:36.120
it was Maureen Robinson.

16:36.203 --> 16:38.622
Stop. It's a team effort.

16:38.706 --> 16:41.250
Sometimes you just need to take
a step back, look at things differently.

16:41.333 --> 16:44.294
I hear we're calling it the <i>Resolute</i>?
I like the sound of that.

16:44.878 --> 16:46.338
Purposeful. Determined.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.632
The director thinks
it will play well with the media.

16:48.716 --> 16:52.302
Well, let's just make sure she can fly
before we worry about how she plays.

16:52.386 --> 16:56.181
Well, we had a good week.
If these figures hold,

16:56.265 --> 17:00.144
the structure should stay sound
at 276,000 miles per hour.

17:00.477 --> 17:01.770
And I can bring that upstairs?

17:01.854 --> 17:04.440
Ye... Yes. Uh, I just...

17:05.399 --> 17:06.233
What?

17:07.109 --> 17:09.153
-It's just theoretical.
-For now.

17:09.236 --> 17:11.363
Well, it's one thing
to withstand those speeds,

17:11.447 --> 17:12.740
it's another thing to reach them.

17:12.823 --> 17:14.950
Every model I've seen
says we're decades away from that.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.453
Yeah. There are more current models.

17:19.997 --> 17:21.874
You understand, it's a clearance thing.

17:23.834 --> 17:24.918
Of course. I just...

17:25.002 --> 17:28.005
I mean, it... it would be great
if our team could be let in--

17:28.088 --> 17:30.799
Are you going to the avionics meeting
at 3:00?

17:31.967 --> 17:36.388
-Yes, I think so.
-Good. I'll see you then.

17:51.653 --> 17:56.158
-Will, everyone's going up. Come on.
-Uh, yeah, I'll be right there.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.627
Still trying to contact your father?

18:07.419 --> 18:09.338
I want to let him know
we have a plan.

18:09.755 --> 18:12.132
-Not yet.

18:13.675 --> 18:15.427
Used to have one of those
when I was a boy.

18:15.511 --> 18:18.639
My friends and I used to send
secret messages back and forth.

18:21.725 --> 18:23.769
I want you to know,
when we get back to the<i> Resolute,</i>

18:23.852 --> 18:26.563
you and your sisters are welcome
to stay with us for as long as you need.

18:26.647 --> 18:30.359
Thanks, but that won't be necessary.

18:30.442 --> 18:32.736
-I just mean to say--
-My mom will be back soon.

18:32.820 --> 18:35.906
And once all the fuel's ready,
we're gonna find my dad...

18:37.449 --> 18:38.408
and save him.

18:41.453 --> 18:42.746
It's good to think positively,

18:42.830 --> 18:44.832
but don't let that keep you
from thinking rationally.

18:44.915 --> 18:46.500
We need you here.
We need your head here.

18:46.583 --> 18:48.418
Helping the people
who still have a chance.

18:51.713 --> 18:52.548
Yeah.

18:58.178 --> 18:59.179
You know, Will...

19:00.430 --> 19:03.600
I wish your dad was here. I do.

19:04.685 --> 19:05.978
I'm sorry he isn't.

19:06.311 --> 19:08.063
He was trying to do
what he thought was best,

19:08.147 --> 19:09.565
just like you are now.

19:10.774 --> 19:14.027
But I always tell my son,
there are times to follow your heart

19:14.111 --> 19:15.696
and times to follow your head.

19:16.071 --> 19:17.906
Which one do you think
my dad was following

19:17.990 --> 19:20.742
when he risked his life to save everyone?

19:24.454 --> 19:26.498
It takes a certain type of person
to do that.

19:28.834 --> 19:29.668
Yeah.

19:30.669 --> 19:33.046
It does. But if he'd waited another day,
he wouldn't have had to.

19:36.967 --> 19:39.803
History books are full of stories
of heroic men and their sacrifices,

19:39.887 --> 19:41.513
but do you know who writes those stories?

19:44.975 --> 19:45.976
The survivors.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.191
I'll see you inside.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.879
<i>Generating last-known Chariot location.</i>

21:38.463 --> 21:39.881
-Hmm.

21:41.174 --> 21:43.385
Okay, so that's the cave.

21:45.137 --> 21:49.099
What are you doing
all the way over there by yourself?

21:50.309 --> 21:52.060
<i> Chariot 21 located.</i>

21:52.644 --> 21:53.812
Got ya.

21:54.396 --> 21:58.108
All right. Hang on, Mom. I'm coming.

21:58.608 --> 22:00.319
<i>Navigating to Chariot 21.</i>

22:07.909 --> 22:10.329
This is where I was standing
when it turned on.

22:11.496 --> 22:15.000
Did you touch anything?
-I don't know. I'm trying to, uh...

22:19.421 --> 22:22.132
John was behind me. Uh...

22:23.717 --> 22:26.845
Yeah, over my right...
No. Over... Over my left shoulder.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.267
-Yes. That's right.

22:36.521 --> 22:38.023
I don't see anything that could...

22:39.649 --> 22:43.737
Wait. Maybe it wasn't me or John at all.
Will.

22:43.862 --> 22:45.364
-He was...

22:50.077 --> 22:52.829
He was standing there,
in that back corner.

22:53.288 --> 22:56.208
-Yeah. A little further back.

23:02.339 --> 23:03.465
Do you see anything?

23:07.052 --> 23:08.303
Smith?

23:09.304 --> 23:13.683
I think we should stick together.
After all, we're a team now, right?

23:19.523 --> 23:22.484
Now tell me where your son was.
The truth.

23:24.027 --> 23:24.861
Outside.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.365
-He was outside with the robot.

23:28.448 --> 23:30.158
He was teaching him
how to throw a baseball.

23:32.119 --> 23:34.204
That does sound like Will, doesn't it?

23:34.788 --> 23:38.708
All that power under his control
and he uses it to play catch.

23:40.001 --> 23:41.670
What would you use it for?

23:43.547 --> 23:44.714
The truth.

23:49.094 --> 23:50.303
To stop running. Stop pretending.

23:58.186 --> 23:59.896
With the robot by my side...

24:02.315 --> 24:03.567
no one could hurt me.

24:06.987 --> 24:07.904
I could just...

24:10.824 --> 24:12.033
be myself.

24:14.619 --> 24:16.872
Do you remember who that is anymore?

24:17.664 --> 24:21.042
Just a girl, before her mother died.

24:24.171 --> 24:27.841
Before her sister shone brighter
in her father's eyes.

24:32.429 --> 24:36.975
Before she ran away
and filled the emptiness with mistakes.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.106
I wanna be that girl.

24:44.399 --> 24:46.234
You don't need a machine to be that.

24:47.569 --> 24:50.405
If you had known who I really was,
would you have taken me in?

24:51.072 --> 24:54.576
No. But a doctor,
there's someone you could trust.

24:54.659 --> 24:57.245
I didn't trust you
because you were a doctor.

24:58.246 --> 25:00.415
I trusted you because you helped us.

25:00.498 --> 25:03.126
And that's all I'm trying to do right now.

25:04.461 --> 25:06.796
To get us all off this planet.

25:08.340 --> 25:09.591
Back to the<i> Resolute.</i>

25:11.551 --> 25:16.348
Don't you see, Maureen?
I'm not the villain of this story.

25:18.266 --> 25:19.434
I'm the hero.

25:25.398 --> 25:26.483
So prove it.

25:33.031 --> 25:33.949
Release me.

25:50.048 --> 25:51.466
I don't think so.

25:57.222 --> 25:58.056
Oh, my God.

26:02.435 --> 26:04.229
I've seen that before.

26:06.982 --> 26:09.776
What part of "restricted area"
don't you understand?

26:09.859 --> 26:12.821
It doesn't say
who it's restricted to.

26:12.904 --> 26:15.115
It's their fault
for not being more specific.

26:15.198 --> 26:18.410
Plus, don't you wanna see what happens?
Everybody's talking about it.

26:18.493 --> 26:21.830
Everybody? You have two friends
on the <i>Resolute.</i>

26:21.913 --> 26:24.541
Okay, and they're both talking about it.
Shut up.

26:27.252 --> 26:28.211
Here goes.

26:34.175 --> 26:35.552
Oh, wow.

26:37.512 --> 26:41.349
-It's magic.
-No. It's science.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.810
Electromagnetic charges
from the other side of the wall

26:43.893 --> 26:46.479
are changing the balance of electrons
on this side of the wall.

26:46.563 --> 26:49.816
Oh, yeah, sure.
Now that it got nerdy, suddenly it's cool.

26:51.067 --> 26:54.571
-Yeah, go for it. Fight the power.

27:03.121 --> 27:04.497
Hey, guys.

27:06.374 --> 27:09.336
Hey, Mom. What's up?

27:11.087 --> 27:12.255
She made me do it.

27:14.633 --> 27:15.967
How long have you been standing there?

27:16.051 --> 27:18.678
Long enough to know
that you didn't go to the med bay

27:18.762 --> 27:19.846
like you were supposed to.

27:19.929 --> 27:23.641
Okay, in our defense, as far as
teen rebellion goes, this is mild.

27:24.976 --> 27:27.437
Do you have any idea what's behind there?

27:28.772 --> 27:30.607
-Go get your immuno-boosters.
-But I wanted--

27:30.690 --> 27:31.650
Go.

28:25.286 --> 28:29.124
-We find out what's behind this wall.

28:30.166 --> 28:32.085
-But how's that gonna--
-Because the only thing

28:32.168 --> 28:34.421
that can create that kind of charge
is power.

28:35.630 --> 28:40.385
This ship may look like it's dead,
but it's still breathing.

28:45.223 --> 28:49.060
Mr. Watanabe says the converters
can turn waste into fuel in about an hour.

28:49.144 --> 28:52.605
-So once we figure out where Dad is--
You've got to stop.

28:54.190 --> 28:56.985
-You're carrying around this radio...

28:58.486 --> 29:00.155
Dad's gone, okay?

29:01.448 --> 29:03.867
-It would have been impossible--

29:03.950 --> 29:07.454
Any more impossible
than Judy being saved from the ice?

29:08.538 --> 29:12.751
You finding us in that storm?
Mom and Dad being together again?

29:15.086 --> 29:18.173
The impossible happens all the time.

29:21.342 --> 29:22.927
Just have to believe it can.

29:45.408 --> 29:46.534
Thank you.

29:55.460 --> 29:59.005
Turn it off.
Wait, it's not me.

29:59.088 --> 30:01.424
Turn it off. Make it stop.
What are you doing?

30:03.176 --> 30:04.969
Wait, it wasn't sending.

30:07.096 --> 30:10.058
-It was receiving.
-Dad's alive.

30:19.150 --> 30:20.860
Get out! Get out! Go!

30:21.110 --> 30:22.570
Here! Come on!
-Run for it!

30:22.654 --> 30:23.947
Get out!
-Come on!

30:24.030 --> 30:26.241
Let's go! Now!
Everybody! Come on!

30:27.951 --> 30:30.787
Quick! Grab your mother!
-Mom!

30:34.207 --> 30:35.625
Hiroki!

30:40.213 --> 30:42.048
-No!

30:55.353 --> 30:56.604
What was that?

30:56.688 --> 30:59.482
It's called saving your life.
Now, go! Run!

31:01.651 --> 31:04.612
Come on! Let's move! Let's move!

31:10.159 --> 31:13.204
Is that everybody?
Is everybody out?

31:13.872 --> 31:14.747
Penny!

31:26.134 --> 31:28.428
-Shh...

31:29.679 --> 31:34.517
They're blind. They can only
find you if they can hear you.

31:44.861 --> 31:47.280
Seems like these panels should move.

31:52.410 --> 31:53.411
What is this?

31:55.788 --> 31:56.748
Do you feel something?

31:58.124 --> 31:59.334
Nope, nothing.

32:06.507 --> 32:07.842
There's another one here.

32:25.151 --> 32:29.030
-Relax, I'm not going anywhere.

32:30.198 --> 32:33.534
Sometimes you just need to step back,
get a different perspective.

32:39.082 --> 32:41.209
How tall would you say the robot is?

32:43.127 --> 32:44.337
What does it matter?

32:45.380 --> 32:49.008
Because this ship was meant to be operated
by him, not us.

32:50.760 --> 32:55.640
We need to be the robot's hands.
Both of us, together.

32:57.600 --> 33:00.269
One, two, three.

33:08.069 --> 33:09.237
What is that?

33:17.453 --> 33:19.872
Well, Ms. Harris, I have some good news...

33:20.707 --> 33:21.666
and some bad news.

33:22.250 --> 33:26.379
The good news, we haven't set up
a system of justice yet. No courts. No jail. Bad news...

33:31.342 --> 33:33.636
we haven't set up a system of justice yet,

33:33.720 --> 33:37.432
which means I can do
whatever the hell I want to you.

33:39.559 --> 33:42.020
-Sir, we've had a breach.

33:42.103 --> 33:43.938
I don't know. They're asking for you.

33:47.150 --> 33:50.111
Sit tight. We are not done.
Not even close.

34:02.373 --> 34:05.251
<i>Emergency evacuation protocol initiated.</i>

34:07.503 --> 34:12.133
<i>All </i>Resolute<i> colonists, please proceed</i>
<i>to your assigned Jupiter pods. </i>

34:12.216 --> 34:14.093
<i>Thank you for remaining calm.</i>

34:19.932 --> 34:21.392
This is a disaster.
Yeah.

34:21.476 --> 34:23.728
There was always a risk
they'd come back for it.

34:23.811 --> 34:26.189
What do we do? You saw
what that machine is doing--

34:26.272 --> 34:29.067
Without that engine out here,
we're all dead anyway.

34:29.150 --> 34:32.820
-So you protect it at all costs.
-Yeah.

34:51.923 --> 34:55.551
So the robot didn't just attack
the<i> Resolute.</i>

34:55.635 --> 34:56.636
No.

34:58.012 --> 34:59.347
It came for something.

35:00.348 --> 35:02.725
-Our engine.
-But that makes no sense.

35:02.809 --> 35:05.061
I mean, they're clearly more advanced
than we are.

35:06.729 --> 35:12.360
-Because it wasn't our engine.

35:15.321 --> 35:20.576
We didn't just miraculously develop
the technology to travel the universe.

35:22.328 --> 35:23.579
We stole it.

35:24.372 --> 35:28.084
How

35:29.085 --> 35:30.169
Shoot it down?

35:33.464 --> 35:37.343
To hide something like that,
you'd need one hell of a cover story.

35:37.426 --> 35:38.636
Something like a...

35:40.972 --> 35:42.098
A Christmas star.

36:10.209 --> 36:11.836
Let's go.

36:13.045 --> 36:14.505
Is she crazy?

36:16.340 --> 36:19.218
We walk very quietly.

36:19.802 --> 36:20.887
Step by step.

36:20.970 --> 36:23.723
Sure. Then gross things fly down
and eat us.

36:24.932 --> 36:26.767
You have a better idea?

36:27.727 --> 36:29.020
No, but...

36:29.729 --> 36:30.605
What do you think?

36:33.983 --> 36:35.526
He's hurt.

36:36.485 --> 36:37.904
We have to get him help.

36:39.989 --> 36:41.824
Okay, okay, okay.

36:43.159 --> 36:44.368
Let's go.

37:43.844 --> 37:44.804
Okay.

39:01.714 --> 39:04.425
<i>Yeah!</i>

39:07.636 --> 39:09.388
-Penny!
-Oh, my God.

39:19.106 --> 39:19.940
Okay.

39:21.192 --> 39:23.611
I radioed Dad again.
He signaled back.

39:23.694 --> 39:24.779
-Yeah.

39:24.862 --> 39:25.780
Where is he?

39:25.863 --> 39:29.367
I don't know, but he's up there somewhere.

39:30.451 --> 39:32.411
Okay, what do you say we go find him?

39:36.665 --> 39:37.500
Hey, Robinsons.

39:40.795 --> 39:41.796
Well done.

39:54.600 --> 39:55.643
Angela.

39:59.021 --> 40:01.857
I wanted to say thank you
for what you did back there.

40:02.900 --> 40:06.237
After what I did to your family,
it's the least I could--

40:06.320 --> 40:07.154
No.

40:08.531 --> 40:09.573
That wasn't your fault.

40:11.826 --> 40:16.288
Dr. Smith has a way of making people
do things they regret.

40:20.709 --> 40:23.462
Well, I appreciate your forgiveness.

40:25.005 --> 40:30.052
And when you see your father again,
please tell him I'm sorry.

40:30.136 --> 40:33.556
Maybe you can tell him that yourself,
once we're all back on the<i> Resolute.</i>

40:36.934 --> 40:38.853
The<i> Resolute</i> leaves in four hours.
Need to keep moving.

40:38.936 --> 40:39.770
Yeah.

40:42.314 --> 40:43.149
Penny.

40:45.234 --> 40:47.987
Vijay? Come on.

40:48.070 --> 40:49.280
Be right there.

40:50.156 --> 40:51.073
Hey.

40:51.866 --> 40:52.700
Hey.

40:54.827 --> 40:56.454
Thanks for saving my ass back there.

40:56.871 --> 40:59.331
Well, you'd look pretty stupid
walking around without it.

40:59.415 --> 41:00.666
So, I thought...

41:02.168 --> 41:05.337
-That was a joke.
-Yeah, no, I know. Yeah. Um...

41:06.130 --> 41:09.800
I'm gonna go tell Judy the good news.

41:13.637 --> 41:15.306
Look, I just want to say that--

41:15.389 --> 41:17.725
It was stupid to break up with me. I know.

41:17.808 --> 41:18.809
Yeah.

41:18.893 --> 41:22.104
That it was rude and really immature.

41:22.188 --> 41:25.483
Well, I mean, I wasn't gonna use
exactly those words...

41:25.566 --> 41:27.109
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

41:28.319 --> 41:31.071
Like, maybe when we're back up
on the<i> Resolute,</i>

41:31.155 --> 41:34.283
we can hang out sometime?

41:37.411 --> 41:41.373
No. No, I'm good.
But, uh, see you around, Vijay.

41:58.182 --> 42:00.976
<i>Judy! Judy, guess what!</i>

42:01.602 --> 42:02.520
<i>Judy--</i>

42:02.811 --> 42:05.689
I can't talk right now. Think I found Mom.
I'll call you later. Bye.

42:05.773 --> 42:06.941
<i>Judy, wait--</i>

42:18.911 --> 42:21.580
Look, if you untie me,
if I had the right equipment,

42:21.664 --> 42:23.332
I think I could get this ship
flight-worthy.

42:23.415 --> 42:25.960
Ugh! How's that supposed to help me?

42:26.043 --> 42:28.254
Well, you wouldn't die here,
for one thing.

42:28.629 --> 42:34.718
If I go back to the<i> Resolute</i> without him,
my life is over anyway.

42:35.678 --> 42:39.932
I'll be locked up, sent back to Earth.
So thanks, but no thanks.

42:42.059 --> 42:43.269
We could vouch for you.

42:43.602 --> 42:46.313
We could tell Radic about
how you helped us to survive down here.

42:46.397 --> 42:48.857
-Surely that--
-Do you expect me to believe that,

42:48.941 --> 42:51.110
after all the hurt I've caused you?

42:54.113 --> 42:56.156
I give you my word.

43:01.912 --> 43:04.039
So if I were to ask right now
if you were stalling,

43:04.123 --> 43:07.084
and waiting for your family to save you,
you'd tell me the truth?

43:07.459 --> 43:08.335
I would.

43:12.464 --> 43:15.759
I hope you're a better rocket scientist
than you are a liar.

43:40.951 --> 43:42.119
Judy!

43:43.287 --> 43:46.874
-Get me out of this.

43:58.135 --> 43:59.136
Okay, now what?

43:59.219 --> 44:00.679
How about we get the hell off this planet?

44:00.763 --> 44:02.431
Great. Any ideas how we can do that?

44:02.514 --> 44:04.683
-Ask your son, he figured it out.

44:04.767 --> 44:05.976
I'll let him tell you.

44:17.321 --> 44:18.280
Back up.

44:20.115 --> 44:20.949
Back up.

44:24.495 --> 44:28.374
-Come on. Come on, let's go!
It won't go!

44:34.505 --> 44:35.339
Come on!

44:48.727 --> 44:50.938
Danger, Dr. Smith.
