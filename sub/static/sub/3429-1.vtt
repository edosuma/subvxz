01:42.863 --> 01:45.855
Go Freemont!
(cheering)

01:45.900 --> 01:48.698
Okay, everybody,
tomorrow after classes

01:48.736 --> 01:51.381
make sure that you have your uniforms
picked up from the dry cleaners,

01:51.405 --> 01:54.602
because the bus for the playoffs
is gonna leave at 7:30 a.m.,

01:54.642 --> 01:55.870
The next morning, all right?

01:55.910 --> 01:57.207
- (sighing)
- Oh my God.

01:57.244 --> 02:00.338
But the Doughnut Hole has agreed
to donate four dozen doughnuts.

02:00.381 --> 02:02.178
All: Yeah!

02:02.216 --> 02:04.127
Okay, we're gonna kill
the Rangers this year, right?

02:04.151 --> 02:06.244
All: Yeah!

02:06.287 --> 02:08.448
I can't believe you're leaving.

02:08.489 --> 02:11.185
It's just a couple of hours
before you go.

02:11.225 --> 02:14.661
Yeah. Right.
Right.

02:14.695 --> 02:17.289
Aren't you excited?
It's playoffs!

02:17.331 --> 02:19.322
Yeah. Whatever.

02:46.493 --> 02:48.427
Come on.

02:48.462 --> 02:50.589
I have to get home for dinner.

02:50.631 --> 02:52.963
Please.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.264
Oh, all right.

03:06.080 --> 03:08.514
Father:
That's some beef.

03:09.950 --> 03:12.851
- Mother: And carrots.
- Yummy.

03:12.886 --> 03:14.717
Thank you, Mother.

03:14.755 --> 03:17.383
Thanks.

03:17.424 --> 03:19.984
- Thank you, poodle.
- Sure.

03:22.730 --> 03:24.595
Grace.

03:24.631 --> 03:26.121
Father:
Dear Lord,

03:26.166 --> 03:28.657
please bless this food
that we are about to eat.

03:28.702 --> 03:33.332
We thank you for the abundance
that You have provided.

03:33.374 --> 03:36.775
Please help us to follow Your path,

03:36.810 --> 03:40.644
the one you intended us all to follow.

03:40.681 --> 03:43.013
And Lord...

03:43.050 --> 03:49.285
please help us to obey
the roles in life You set for us.

03:49.323 --> 03:53.054
For all that is natural and...

03:53.093 --> 03:56.551
healthy...

03:56.597 --> 03:58.588
and sacred,

04:00.234 --> 04:02.862
in Your name we pray.

04:02.903 --> 04:03.961
Amen.

04:04.004 --> 04:06.131
- Amen.
- Let's eat.

04:38.272 --> 04:40.968
(car horn honking)
Bye, dear.

04:41.008 --> 04:44.967
See ya later, swee... I mean tonight.
See you tonight.

04:45.012 --> 04:47.003
Don't forget your
library books by the door.

04:47.047 --> 04:49.038
Got them. Bye.

04:51.351 --> 04:53.478
So... are we ready?

04:53.520 --> 04:55.681
They'll all be here at 3:00.

04:55.722 --> 04:58.020
Jesus, I hope we're
doing the right thing.

04:58.058 --> 05:00.288
(bell rings)

05:00.327 --> 05:03.262
Shaker Hills, here we come.

05:03.297 --> 05:05.891
Remember, 7:30 doughnuts.

05:10.370 --> 05:11.894
Boy: Did you talk
to both her parents?

05:11.939 --> 05:14.908
- Girl: She's coming.
- Kill the Rangers.

05:20.347 --> 05:22.338
I'll meet you outside.

05:31.725 --> 05:34.250
Don't you hate it when they do that?

05:34.294 --> 05:36.285
I think it's fun.

05:37.331 --> 05:39.322
Maybe he just doesn't do it right.

05:46.240 --> 05:48.231
- See ya.
- Bye.

06:00.554 --> 06:03.546
(horn honks)
Speed up, jerk!

06:06.860 --> 06:08.259
Jared?

06:08.295 --> 06:10.422
Why are we going so slow?

06:10.464 --> 06:13.797
Sorry.
Zoning, I guess.

06:22.609 --> 06:26.340
Mike, thanks so much for coming
all the way back out here again.

06:26.380 --> 06:28.905
- That's what we're here for.
- Thank you, Mike.

06:28.949 --> 06:31.611
- Now you've watched the video?
- Over and over.

06:31.652 --> 06:33.586
Come in.

06:35.322 --> 06:37.313
(horn honks)

06:39.927 --> 06:41.952
Mike:
The important thing is to be clear.

06:41.995 --> 06:43.519
And direct.

06:43.564 --> 06:45.794
But to do it lovingly.

06:45.832 --> 06:47.595
We're not accusing,

06:47.634 --> 06:48.896
we're supporting.

06:48.936 --> 06:50.904
I think I hear the car.

06:53.907 --> 06:55.898
Uh-oh. Here they come.

07:07.621 --> 07:09.486
Surprise.

07:10.591 --> 07:12.752
What happened?
Is somebody dead?

07:12.793 --> 07:14.693
They're your favorite.

07:14.728 --> 07:18.425
Now, why don't you just
come on in and sit down, honey?

07:18.465 --> 07:20.296
What's going on?

07:20.334 --> 07:21.699
Hi, Megan.

07:21.735 --> 07:23.862
My name is Mike.

07:23.904 --> 07:27.931
Your parents and your friends
want to have a conversation with you,

07:27.975 --> 07:31.274
and I'm here to help
facilitate that dialogue.

07:31.311 --> 07:33.609
So why don't we start
by sitting down,

07:33.647 --> 07:36.115
and making ourselves
comfortable?

07:36.149 --> 07:38.140
How would that be?

07:42.656 --> 07:43.953
Now, Peter,

07:43.991 --> 07:47.392
would you like to start
the conversation?

07:47.427 --> 07:50.225
Megan, we love you.

07:51.231 --> 07:52.721
We all love you.

07:52.766 --> 07:56.429
And lately we've become
concerned about

07:56.470 --> 07:59.701
certain behaviors.

07:59.740 --> 08:03.039
We're afraid you're being
influenced by...

08:03.076 --> 08:05.636
a way of thinking.

08:05.679 --> 08:07.579
Unnatural...

08:07.614 --> 08:09.548
Do you remember the woman on TV?

08:09.583 --> 08:10.982
Honey, we think you're a...

08:11.018 --> 08:12.417
(whispers)
Lesbian.

08:13.820 --> 08:15.151
Huh?

08:16.957 --> 08:20.256
I myself was once a gay.

08:20.294 --> 08:23.786
Now I'm an ex-gay, Megan.

08:23.830 --> 08:27.288
I work for a place
called True Directions

08:27.334 --> 08:30.269
who help people, like yourself,

08:30.304 --> 08:33.034
to learn to understand
the reasons behind

08:33.073 --> 08:35.472
homosexual tendencies,

08:35.509 --> 08:37.635
and how to heal them.

08:37.678 --> 08:42.615
What tendencies?
Why would you think I'm a...

08:42.649 --> 08:46.085
You've been trying
to make us eat this tofu.

08:46.119 --> 08:48.144
In diet, watch for a switch to

08:48.188 --> 08:49.849
vegetarianism.

08:49.890 --> 08:52.620
You don't have any pictures
of guys in your locker,

08:52.659 --> 08:54.024
just these.

08:54.061 --> 08:55.858
Mm-hmm.

08:55.896 --> 08:57.193
And these.

08:57.230 --> 08:58.458
Sexual,

08:58.498 --> 09:02.457
even vaginal motifs
in artwork and decorating.

09:02.502 --> 09:04.470
Gay iconography.

09:07.407 --> 09:10.103
You don't even like to kiss me.

09:10.143 --> 09:11.143
It's true.

09:12.346 --> 09:14.644
I can't believe this.

09:14.681 --> 09:17.741
Denial is a normal part
of the healing process

09:17.784 --> 09:19.945
that we'll explore

09:19.986 --> 09:22.352
at True Directions.

09:22.389 --> 09:25.381
- Healing?
- Like rehab, honey.

09:25.425 --> 09:27.518
Homosexuals Anonymous.

09:27.561 --> 09:30.223
Poodle, it's only for a few months.

09:30.263 --> 09:34.165
There is no way I'm going.

10:32.859 --> 10:34.850
Mother: Let's go.

10:35.962 --> 10:37.657
Now.

10:50.143 --> 10:51.838
Welcome, welcome,
welcome.

10:51.878 --> 10:55.473
I'm Mary,
I'm the founder of True Directions.

10:55.515 --> 10:57.949
- And you must be Megan?
- Yes.

10:57.984 --> 11:00.316
- This is my son, Rock.
- Mother: Hi.

11:00.353 --> 11:02.321
Pleasure to meet you, Megan.

11:02.355 --> 11:05.552
Looks like we got you just in time.

11:05.592 --> 11:07.150
What are you, about 17?

11:07.194 --> 11:09.719
- Yes.
- Almost lost her to college.

11:09.763 --> 11:11.788
It's so much harder
once they've been through

11:11.832 --> 11:14.164
all that liberal arts brainwashing.

11:14.201 --> 11:16.396
But we've saved a few.

11:16.436 --> 11:17.994
I'll take her from here.

11:23.176 --> 11:25.167
Well. Come along.

11:26.079 --> 11:27.706
Mother:
They seem like nice people.

11:27.747 --> 11:29.738
(car starts)

11:33.386 --> 11:34.944
(honks)

11:43.497 --> 11:46.057
The others arrived yesterday,
so why don't I catch you up?

11:46.099 --> 11:50.126
It's a two-month program
based on five simple steps.

11:50.170 --> 11:53.503
Why don't we concentrate
on the first step:

11:53.540 --> 11:56.338
You admitting your problem.

11:56.376 --> 11:57.900
When you see a woman,

11:57.944 --> 11:59.844
in a tight skirt,

11:59.880 --> 12:01.745
and long,

12:01.781 --> 12:03.305
beautiful legs,

12:03.350 --> 12:05.716
or perhaps
she's in the bathroom,

12:05.752 --> 12:08.778
putting lipstick
over her full lips...

12:08.822 --> 12:10.687
or maybe in the locker room,

12:10.724 --> 12:12.453
soaping her body...

12:12.492 --> 12:14.824
rubbing her breasts...

12:14.861 --> 12:16.795
you don't have any
unnatural thoughts?

12:16.830 --> 12:18.695
I don't think it's unnatural.

12:18.732 --> 12:21.257
Ah-ha! You see?

12:21.301 --> 12:23.565
You don't even think it's wrong.

12:23.603 --> 12:26.436
Until you admit your sickness,
you will wear these.

12:26.473 --> 12:28.464
You will earn the right
to wear civvies

12:28.508 --> 12:29.975
once you have admitted

12:30.010 --> 12:31.807
the first step.

12:31.845 --> 12:35.406
It's a long path
to righteousness, Megan.

12:35.448 --> 12:37.541
And it's a battlefield
of temptation out there,

12:37.584 --> 12:39.552
and you're going
to have to fight.

12:39.586 --> 12:40.883
Until then,

12:40.921 --> 12:44.379
I'd like you to meet
one of our other soldiers.

12:44.424 --> 12:45.721
Hilary.

12:47.060 --> 12:49.187
Megan, this is Hilary.

12:49.229 --> 12:51.060
She will show you around.

12:51.097 --> 12:54.555
And, well, you'll get acquainted.

12:55.835 --> 12:58.804
Okay.
Rise and shine at 7:00.

12:58.838 --> 13:00.635
Breakfast at 8:00,

13:00.674 --> 13:03.609
Group therapy until lunch.

13:03.643 --> 13:07.340
Now in the afternoon
we have free time to do,

13:07.380 --> 13:10.872
you know, whatever,
and then we move inside

13:10.917 --> 13:13.852
for reorientating exercises.

13:13.887 --> 13:16.685
Family therapy on the weekends.

13:18.491 --> 13:21.187
You didn't miss much, really.

13:26.566 --> 13:27.624
Oh.

13:28.668 --> 13:30.431
This is where we sleep.

13:30.470 --> 13:34.270
But there's no inappropriate
behavior allowed.

13:34.307 --> 13:36.707
Inappropriate?

13:36.743 --> 13:37.971
Like swearing?

13:38.011 --> 13:40.275
No. Inappropriate like fucking.

13:40.313 --> 13:41.371
Oh.

13:41.414 --> 13:42.658
You get caught
in the throes of sodomy,

13:42.682 --> 13:44.912
and au revoir.

13:53.793 --> 13:57.889
Never mind Graham,
she's a spoiled brat.

13:57.931 --> 13:59.831
I read her chart.

14:01.835 --> 14:04.167
Step one was easy,

14:04.204 --> 14:06.570
admitting you're a homosexual.

14:06.606 --> 14:09.803
See, we all passed yesterday.

14:15.348 --> 14:18.784
I'm a homosexual.

14:18.818 --> 14:20.809
See how easy it is?

14:29.929 --> 14:32.864
Megan, meet the rest of our group.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.199
Hi, Megan.

14:35.235 --> 14:38.693
I'm Jan,
and I'm a softball player,

14:38.738 --> 14:40.467
and I'm a homosexual.

14:42.742 --> 14:45.677
I'm Sinead.
I like pain.

14:45.712 --> 14:47.202
I'm a homosexual.

14:47.247 --> 14:50.444
I'm Joel.
I'm a Jew.

14:51.818 --> 14:53.217
And a...

14:53.253 --> 14:54.777
ho...

14:54.821 --> 14:57.847
homosexual.

14:59.492 --> 15:02.120
- We met.
- Graham.

15:02.162 --> 15:04.153
I'm Graham, and I like girls,

15:04.197 --> 15:06.222
a lot.

15:06.266 --> 15:07.699
I'm a homosexual.

15:10.370 --> 15:12.736
Andre.
Actor. Dancer.

15:12.772 --> 15:14.706
Homosexual.

15:14.741 --> 15:17.403
Dolph. Homosexual.
Varsity wrestler.

15:17.444 --> 15:19.503
How you doin'?

15:19.546 --> 15:23.209
Hi. I'm Clayton Dunn.
I work in retail,

15:23.249 --> 15:25.217
and I'm a homosexual.

15:26.352 --> 15:29.014
It's time for your first disclosure.

15:29.055 --> 15:31.387
Now don't be intimidated.

15:31.424 --> 15:33.892
Why don't you start by telling us

15:33.927 --> 15:37.556
about the first time that you realized
that you might be a lesbian?

15:37.597 --> 15:39.087
I'm not.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.329
Everyone just thinks I am.

15:43.603 --> 15:46.231
I shouldn't even be here.

15:49.542 --> 15:52.909
That's a perfectly
normal place to start.

15:52.946 --> 15:55.710
Why don't we discuss
the issues in your intervention?

15:59.352 --> 16:01.081
I'm a vegetarian.

16:01.121 --> 16:02.486
All: Mm-hmm.

16:03.423 --> 16:05.323
I have pictures of women around.

16:05.358 --> 16:08.259
- You think that's normal?
- Sure.

16:10.230 --> 16:11.993
I never really thought about it.

16:12.031 --> 16:13.658
Have you ever had a boyfriend?

16:13.700 --> 16:18.364
Yes. For two years
we've been going steady.

16:18.404 --> 16:21.862
I really love him.
He's smart and popular.

16:21.908 --> 16:24.934
He's got the biggest dick
I've never seen.

16:24.978 --> 16:26.707
Well, um...

16:26.746 --> 16:29.909
have you ever had sex with him?

16:29.949 --> 16:31.382
I'm a Christian.

16:31.417 --> 16:34.784
It's really easy to be a prude
when you're not attracted to him, isn't it?

16:35.889 --> 16:37.516
He's very handsome.

16:37.557 --> 16:39.252
But does he make you hot?

16:39.292 --> 16:42.090
Do you think of him
at night when you...

16:42.128 --> 16:44.323
I'm not perverted.

16:44.364 --> 16:47.299
I get good grades.
I go to church.

16:47.333 --> 16:49.096
I'm a cheerleader.

16:50.503 --> 16:52.266
I'm not like all of you.

16:52.305 --> 16:55.900
Everyone reads "Cosmo."
Everyone looks at other girls.

16:55.942 --> 16:57.569
All the time.

16:57.610 --> 17:00.602
You only assume that they're thinking
what you're thinking when they look.

17:00.647 --> 17:02.478
But they're not.

17:05.919 --> 17:07.511
Freemont power. Freemont pride.

17:07.554 --> 17:09.579
Be aggressive.
Drive, drive, drive.

17:09.622 --> 17:11.954
Go Freemont!

17:12.992 --> 17:15.425
I thought everybody
had those thoughts.

17:18.231 --> 17:20.425
I just want to be normal.

17:20.465 --> 17:22.763
Then you admit
you're not normal.

17:22.801 --> 17:24.666
So why don't you admit

17:24.704 --> 17:27.194
you are a homosexual?

17:30.310 --> 17:33.302
(voices echoing)

17:34.514 --> 17:36.038
Both:
You hug us way too much.

17:36.082 --> 17:37.982
Hilary:
Step one was easy.

17:38.017 --> 17:39.814
You don't even like to kiss me.

17:41.221 --> 17:42.882
You put your hand up my skirt.

17:42.922 --> 17:45.550
- Homosexual
- I think it's foul.

17:47.193 --> 17:49.161
- Homosexual.
- Homosexual.

17:49.195 --> 17:52.028
- Homosexual.
- Homosexual.

17:52.065 --> 17:54.397
I'm a homosexual.

17:55.902 --> 18:00.862
I'm a homosexual.
I'm a homosexual.

18:00.907 --> 18:03.034
Congratulations, Megan.

18:03.076 --> 18:05.340
You have just taken your first step

18:05.378 --> 18:07.676
in your true direction!

18:07.714 --> 18:10.376
(clapping)

18:12.986 --> 18:15.921
I'm a homosexual.

18:16.923 --> 18:18.754
Okay.

18:18.791 --> 18:21.351
Go on now.

18:26.599 --> 18:30.160
Don't worry, Megan.
It's gonna be okay.

18:30.637 --> 18:32.434
No.

18:32.472 --> 18:34.372
Here. Put these on.

18:40.480 --> 18:42.812
Oh my God.

18:46.286 --> 18:48.277
They were right.

18:49.455 --> 18:51.480
I'm a homo.

18:54.160 --> 18:56.390
Oh my God.

19:05.939 --> 19:09.238
Congratulations on
your first step, pom-pom.

19:15.014 --> 19:16.641
Don't listen to her.

19:16.683 --> 19:19.243
She's just upset
'cause the fish on her plate

19:19.285 --> 19:21.480
is the only kind she can eat.

19:21.521 --> 19:25.116
I can't wait to be straight.
I've always wanted to be.

19:25.158 --> 19:26.887
It's cool to finally talk about it.

19:26.926 --> 19:29.087
I can't tell any of my
friends on the team.

19:29.128 --> 19:30.425
Maybe you have
the wrong friends.

19:30.463 --> 19:33.091
I think we should all be
supporting each other.

19:33.132 --> 19:35.600
Really, princess. Do you
want to start the kumbayas?

19:45.111 --> 19:46.373
Hi Mom.

19:46.412 --> 19:47.674
The flowers are pretty.

19:47.714 --> 19:49.705
I know.

19:51.985 --> 19:54.613
I noticed that we sprung
another leak in the ceiling.

19:54.654 --> 19:56.713
I'd like for you
to get to it tonight.

19:56.756 --> 19:58.485
I'll get to it, Mom.
Jesus.

19:59.792 --> 20:01.726
Ow! I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

20:01.761 --> 20:03.285
Look.
Not in my presence.

20:03.329 --> 20:05.797
I have told you
over and over again.

20:05.832 --> 20:09.598
No more sipping.
Chug it, like a man.

20:09.635 --> 20:11.626
Go on. Chug.

20:14.674 --> 20:15.732
There.

20:15.775 --> 20:17.470
Try and get to that tonight.

20:27.954 --> 20:31.185
(sighs)

20:32.225 --> 20:35.319
(electronic buzzing,
soft moaning)

20:50.243 --> 20:51.243
Yeah.

20:55.448 --> 20:58.212
Sorry, it's just me.
What are you doing?

20:58.251 --> 21:00.310
AV, what's it to ya?

21:00.353 --> 21:02.184
AV? What's that?

21:02.221 --> 21:04.815
Aversion therapy, stupid.

21:04.857 --> 21:06.722
So what does that mean?

21:06.759 --> 21:10.217
When you have inappropriate
fantasies about girls,

21:10.263 --> 21:13.130
you shock yourself with this shocker.
(buzzes)

21:13.166 --> 21:16.499
So every time you think of them,
you feel that pain.

21:16.536 --> 21:17.935
That's sick.

21:17.970 --> 21:20.598
No pain, no gain, baby.
You want to like dick?

21:20.640 --> 21:22.835
You better start training yourself.

21:22.875 --> 21:25.036
Hey, isn't that Graham's sock?

21:25.078 --> 21:27.842
None of your damn business.

21:33.986 --> 21:36.580
(buzzing continues)

21:41.494 --> 21:43.052
Megan.

21:43.096 --> 21:45.087
You have a phone call.

21:45.131 --> 21:46.655
Hello?

21:46.699 --> 21:48.530
Mother:
Megan, it's Mom and Dad.

21:48.568 --> 21:51.696
We know it's after lights out,
but we miss you so much.

21:51.737 --> 21:55.036
Father: We just wanted to know
how our little poodle is doing.

21:55.074 --> 21:56.871
I'm doing okay.

21:56.909 --> 21:58.376
You were right,

21:58.411 --> 22:00.345
I am a homosexual.

22:00.379 --> 22:02.438
But I'll be regular soon.

22:02.482 --> 22:05.007
Father: Oh, that Mary
is pretty good then, huh?

22:05.051 --> 22:06.643
Mm-hmm, and Mike
and all others.

22:06.686 --> 22:08.313
I'm already starting step two.

22:08.354 --> 22:11.084
Father: We're so glad,
and after all that money.

22:11.124 --> 22:13.388
Mother: We can't wait
to see you up there at graduation,

22:13.426 --> 22:16.156
to have you home,
so we can all be together again.

22:16.195 --> 22:17.239
Father:
Just remember we love you.

22:17.263 --> 22:19.697
We would do anything for our Megan
to have a normal life,

22:19.732 --> 22:21.810
- and if you need anything...
- Mother: We'd better go.

22:21.834 --> 22:22.960
Now you hang in there.

22:23.002 --> 22:24.936
- Stay strong!
- Sweet dreams.

22:24.971 --> 22:27.405
You too, Daddy.
See you at family therapy.

22:27.440 --> 22:28.907
I love you.

22:31.878 --> 22:33.368
And forward.

22:33.412 --> 22:36.540
Backwards and forwards,

22:36.582 --> 22:40.245
and backwards.
In a very clean line...

22:40.286 --> 22:42.413
- you go in, and you go out,

22:42.455 --> 22:44.548
And you go up
and you go down.

22:44.590 --> 22:46.990
Girls, is everybody
paying attention here?

22:47.026 --> 22:51.520
And you go in and out,
and in and out,

22:51.564 --> 22:53.191
and in and out...

22:53.232 --> 22:56.030
Get into every little crevice.

22:56.068 --> 22:58.628
And in and out.

22:58.671 --> 23:00.502
And you slip in...

23:00.540 --> 23:02.599
and out...

23:02.642 --> 23:05.611
add a little more oil,
and shove it in,

23:05.645 --> 23:07.078
and take it out.

23:07.113 --> 23:08.842
Put some muscle into it.

23:08.881 --> 23:12.078
Shove it in and out.

23:12.118 --> 23:15.610
And shove it in,
and take it out.

23:17.290 --> 23:20.384
Okay, who wants
to go down with me?

23:20.426 --> 23:23.793

23:23.829 --> 23:26.161

24:16.515 --> 24:18.540
You're turning into a pretty young lady.

24:18.584 --> 24:20.575
Now hold still.

24:22.054 --> 24:24.045
(whistle blows)
Come on!

24:25.658 --> 24:28.388
All:
Die! Die! Die!

24:30.863 --> 24:32.262
Okay then,

24:32.298 --> 24:35.267
who's left to report out their root?

24:35.301 --> 24:36.859
Andre?

24:36.902 --> 24:40.201
Shit, Miss Mary, I ain't
the only one who don't got no root.

24:40.239 --> 24:42.707
Andre, we don't use profanity,

24:42.742 --> 24:45.233
or double negatives
here at True Directions.

24:46.979 --> 24:48.879
Okay, who's next?

24:48.914 --> 24:51.883
- Megan.
- Well, I've really been thinking,

24:51.917 --> 24:54.977
but, I just can't think of anything.

24:55.021 --> 24:57.990
I think our little prom queen
is too afraid to disclose.

24:58.024 --> 25:00.618
Oh really?
What's your root, Graham?

25:00.660 --> 25:02.719
We're working on your issue,
not mine.

25:02.762 --> 25:03.956
You're deflecting.

25:03.996 --> 25:05.293
Actually,

25:05.331 --> 25:07.822
I think it might be
a great idea for Megan

25:07.867 --> 25:10.062
to be reminded
of your root, Graham.

25:11.470 --> 25:14.303
My mother got married in pants.

25:19.111 --> 25:21.773
All right, let's see, Dolph?

25:21.814 --> 25:25.682
Too many locker room showers
with the varsity team.

25:25.718 --> 25:26.742
Hilary?

25:26.786 --> 25:30.085
All girl boarding school.

25:30.122 --> 25:31.350
Sinead?

25:31.390 --> 25:34.018
I was born in France.

25:34.060 --> 25:35.288
Clayton?

25:35.328 --> 25:37.660
My mom let me play
in her pumps.

25:37.697 --> 25:39.631
I like balls.

25:39.665 --> 25:41.656
Why thank you for that, Jan.

25:42.935 --> 25:44.994
Joel?

25:45.037 --> 25:47.164
Traumatic breasts.

25:47.206 --> 25:50.198
So, yeah.

25:50.242 --> 25:51.766
Now, Megan.

25:51.811 --> 25:54.041
Do you see how easy
it could be?

25:54.080 --> 25:56.480
You just have to
dig down into those

25:56.515 --> 25:59.746
painful memories,
and you'll find it.

26:00.820 --> 26:03.846
Now, Hilary.
Will you please come up here?

26:05.591 --> 26:07.786
Today we are going to learn

26:07.827 --> 26:11.888
one of the most wonderful things
about being a heterosexual...

26:11.931 --> 26:13.023
friendship.

26:13.065 --> 26:14.623
So what I'd like you all to do,

26:14.667 --> 26:16.567
is to start partnering off.

26:16.602 --> 26:21.130
Find yourself a friend for
the remainder of the program.

26:23.676 --> 26:25.644
All right, everybody settle.

26:27.413 --> 26:29.404
Now that we have all
found someone,

26:29.448 --> 26:31.040
what I'd like you to do

26:31.083 --> 26:33.074
is practice sometime tonight

26:33.119 --> 26:35.314
with these.

26:40.393 --> 26:42.190
- It's a woman.
- And what else?

26:42.228 --> 26:43.388
I don't know.

26:43.429 --> 26:44.760
A mother.

26:44.797 --> 26:46.628
Women have roles.
After you learn that,

26:46.665 --> 26:48.656
you'll stop objectifying them.

26:48.701 --> 26:51.363
Haven't you been listening
to anything Mary said?

26:51.404 --> 26:53.133
Well have you?

26:53.172 --> 26:55.834
- Have I what?
- Stopped objectifying them.

26:55.875 --> 26:58.639
I'm still looking for my root.

26:58.677 --> 27:00.736
Must be tough
when you're such a priss.

27:03.616 --> 27:05.413
Your turn.

27:08.721 --> 27:09.915
- (buzzing)
- Ow!

27:09.955 --> 27:12.719
You really have to be more prepared
for temptation, Megan.

27:12.758 --> 27:14.350
(sighs)

27:20.766 --> 27:22.324
Give it to me.

27:22.368 --> 27:24.768
I'm open.

27:42.555 --> 27:43.954
Mike: Boys!

27:43.989 --> 27:47.857
Don't you see how sad
and pathetic you all are,

27:47.893 --> 27:52.387
always wanting something
you can't have?

27:52.431 --> 27:56.697
If I catch you looking
at another man like that

27:56.735 --> 27:58.760
ever again,

27:58.804 --> 28:02.433
you'll be watching sports
the whole weekend.

28:04.643 --> 28:07.669
Mary: First thing we do,
is we pull these tabs out.

28:07.713 --> 28:10.546
Then you fold it over.

28:10.583 --> 28:12.778
Right now I've used
food coloring.

28:12.818 --> 28:14.752
This way you could
see it better.

28:14.787 --> 28:16.721
And if it's a boy, well it

28:16.755 --> 28:19.622
- tinkles out.
- That's the wrong tab, okay?

28:19.658 --> 28:21.636
Will you please hold it still
while I'm doing this?

28:21.660 --> 28:23.059
You're doing it all wrong.

28:23.095 --> 28:25.222
No, I'm not. If you would just
give it to me to do,

28:25.264 --> 28:27.630
it would be fine.

28:27.666 --> 28:28.598
Mary: Girls...

28:28.634 --> 28:30.465
intervene.

28:34.173 --> 28:37.768
Let's try that one more time.

28:42.748 --> 28:44.340
...and I realized

28:44.383 --> 28:47.614
that when we finished
swimming lessons

28:47.653 --> 28:51.555
we would change
in front of each other.

28:51.590 --> 28:53.581
And that's it...

28:53.626 --> 28:55.526
why I'm a homo.

28:55.561 --> 28:59.122
Andre, that's what kids do
after swimming lessons.

28:59.164 --> 29:01.132
Change,
everybody does that.

29:01.166 --> 29:03.225
But I took one look
at those boys,

29:03.269 --> 29:05.737
and I got a...
you know what.

29:05.771 --> 29:07.568
(coughs)

29:07.606 --> 29:11.975
I can relate to that.

29:12.011 --> 29:15.003
When I used to study with Jacob,

29:15.047 --> 29:17.709
we used to touch each others legs,

29:17.750 --> 29:19.377
and rub up against each other.

29:19.418 --> 29:21.750
Blowing each other after
your fuckin' bar mitzvah's

29:21.787 --> 29:24.119
a little bit different
than learning to dog paddle.

29:24.156 --> 29:26.147
That is totally uncalled for.

29:26.191 --> 29:28.921
Well excuse me, but we're paying
a lot of money here

29:28.961 --> 29:30.428
to get these kids fixed,

29:30.462 --> 29:33.556
not sit around,
and listen to stories all day.

29:33.599 --> 29:36.568
Graham, I hope you're getting
a little more out of this program

29:36.602 --> 29:38.934
than that faggot over there.

29:38.971 --> 29:41.599
Mr. Eaton,
I don't find that appropriate.

29:41.640 --> 29:45.007
No, he's right,

29:45.044 --> 29:49.310
it was a stupid ass root.

29:49.348 --> 29:53.614
I'm never gonna know why
I'm a faggot.

29:53.652 --> 29:55.552
I've heard enough
of this crap.

29:55.588 --> 29:56.898
And when you get back
from Switzerland,

29:56.922 --> 29:59.789
you'd better have this gay thing
out of your system. Got it?

29:59.825 --> 30:01.315
I got it.

30:01.360 --> 30:04.386
You fuck up, no college,

30:04.430 --> 30:06.625
no car, no trust fund.

30:20.613 --> 30:23.047
I'm not sitting
in any room with faggots.

30:28.187 --> 30:29.654
Mary: Megan...

30:29.688 --> 30:33.283
it's your turn to report
out your root.

30:33.325 --> 30:36.260
I think it might be
my parents.

30:36.295 --> 30:39.059
Okay, go with that.

30:39.098 --> 30:42.966
You know we've kinda been
like this greeting card family.

30:43.002 --> 30:46.165
And then there was
that one year where...

30:46.205 --> 30:48.765
well Dad was unemployed
and Mom had to support us.

30:48.807 --> 30:52.299
Wait a minute,
that was only for nine months.

30:52.344 --> 30:55.677
And then I was offered
a much better job at the plant.

30:56.782 --> 31:00.183
Maybe seeing Mom
kind of being the Dad, maybe l...

31:01.353 --> 31:05.346
maybe I got the wrong idea
about the roles of men and women.

31:05.391 --> 31:06.915
Absolutely.

31:06.959 --> 31:09.689
I can't believe that you didn't
mention this earlier.

31:09.728 --> 31:13.255
Your father was emasculated,
your mother was domineering.

31:13.298 --> 31:14.298
Well not exactly.

31:14.333 --> 31:17.302
You wanted to emulate your mother.

31:17.336 --> 31:20.931
You have no respect for men,
because you don't respect your father.

31:20.973 --> 31:23.407
- It's really not like that.
- Megan,

31:23.442 --> 31:26.206
you have found your root.

31:29.348 --> 31:32.112
In order to start healing
this festering wound,

31:32.151 --> 31:34.619
I want you to write a song.

31:34.653 --> 31:36.382
It's very therapeutic,

31:36.422 --> 31:38.549
and it's good to put
your feelings down.

31:44.830 --> 31:46.388
(blows whistle)

31:46.432 --> 31:49.162
Free time is up in 20.

31:49.201 --> 31:51.499
That means inside.

32:15.327 --> 32:17.022
What is it?

32:23.335 --> 32:26.361
Nothing. Trash.

32:33.612 --> 32:35.842
What am I, contagious?

32:49.895 --> 32:51.658
What is that?

32:51.697 --> 32:53.995
I'm stuck on
five, six, seven, eight.

32:54.032 --> 32:56.330
- God is good.
- God is straight.

32:57.369 --> 32:59.360
Hey that's good.

33:04.643 --> 33:07.271
It's not supposed
to be intellectual.

33:07.312 --> 33:11.510
Cheers are supposed to be simple,
make people feel good.

33:11.550 --> 33:13.450
Cheers make girls
do stupid cartwheels,

33:13.485 --> 33:15.953
orgasms make people feel good.

33:22.494 --> 33:25.019
Your parents didn't
stay very long.

33:27.032 --> 33:28.932
I imagine it gets uncomfortable

33:28.967 --> 33:32.130
sitting that long
with a stick up your ass.

33:32.171 --> 33:36.267
I'm sure they're just trying
to do what's best for you.

33:36.308 --> 33:38.119
I thought it was just an act,
but you really are

33:38.143 --> 33:40.407
as sweet as fucking pie,
aren't you?

33:40.445 --> 33:43.005
This is bullshit, Megan.
It doesn't work.

33:43.048 --> 33:46.211
You are who you are.
The only trick is not getting caught.

33:48.554 --> 33:51.455
How'd you end up here?

33:51.490 --> 33:54.550
I got caught.

33:54.593 --> 33:56.652
Doing what?

34:02.034 --> 34:05.595
I had this friend,

34:05.637 --> 34:09.505
and we just spent
a little too much time together.

34:09.541 --> 34:13.033
What were you doing?

34:13.078 --> 34:15.239
What do you think?

34:22.387 --> 34:26.322
My step-mom caught us in my room
one day and sent me here.

34:30.929 --> 34:32.920
Were you in love with her?

34:35.634 --> 34:36.828
Does it matter?

34:39.838 --> 34:43.899

Dolph, I am really
disappointed in you.

37:01.480 --> 37:04.711
I thought you had what it took
to get out of here clean.

37:04.750 --> 37:06.809
It's time to wake Mary.

37:06.852 --> 37:09.286
Come on!
Come on!

37:09.321 --> 37:11.289
Come on!

37:19.898 --> 37:22.958
Mary: Whoever started this
is out of this house,

37:23.001 --> 37:24.764
and the other is really
in the dog house.

- Dolph: I can't go home.

37:26.838 --> 37:31.275
Mary: I am not interested
in anybody's sob stories.

37:31.309 --> 37:35.211
I can only help those
who are willing to help themselves.

37:35.247 --> 37:39.013
Now... who started this?

37:39.051 --> 37:41.986
Someone has got to start talking!

37:46.625 --> 37:49.093
All right, Clayton, you little pervert...

37:49.127 --> 37:51.186
- What?

37:51.229 --> 37:54.096

38:22.494 --> 38:24.792
I wish I could've seen
those two boys in action,

38:24.830 --> 38:28.061
before Miss Thing over there,
went Nancy Drew on us.

38:28.100 --> 38:30.967
If that little twink
woulda narked on me,

38:31.002 --> 38:33.232
heads would have rolled.

38:35.407 --> 38:37.185
Would you tie her to your bed
and zap her to death?

38:37.209 --> 38:39.200
Or are you running low
on batteries?

38:59.231 --> 39:01.461
Mary:
And here are our love-birds,

39:01.500 --> 39:04.333
taking a relaxing
evening stroll together.

39:04.369 --> 39:07.532
Notice how affectionate they are.

39:07.572 --> 39:09.938
This could be you.

39:09.975 --> 39:14.469

for lovemaking,

39:30.829 --> 39:34.993

and touches her breasts.

40:41.199 --> 40:43.190
I didn't... I didn't mean that.

40:46.605 --> 40:49.130
I don't have any friends.

40:53.044 --> 40:55.035
What about you?

40:55.947 --> 40:57.972
Well, I thought I did.

40:59.117 --> 41:03.144
- Do they know you're here?
- Oh yeah.

41:03.188 --> 41:05.179
It's rough.

41:25.810 --> 41:28.040
What's going on?
It's almost lights out.

41:28.079 --> 41:29.910
We're sneaking out.
Get dressed.

41:29.948 --> 41:31.279
But Mary...

41:31.316 --> 41:33.250
Fuck Mary.

41:33.285 --> 41:36.083
No way.
There's only four weeks left.

41:36.121 --> 41:38.487
There's no way
I'm getting thrown out now.

41:38.523 --> 41:41.822
Megan, they're never gonna
find about this.

41:41.860 --> 41:43.555
We haven't had fun in forever.

41:45.964 --> 41:49.832
Come on.
We could use a little fun.

41:51.770 --> 41:55.228
- What if we get caught?
- Were not gonna get caught.

41:59.611 --> 42:03.274
If you're not coming with us,
at least don't rat on us.

42:03.315 --> 42:05.078
Let's go.

42:36.514 --> 42:38.948
Come on. Hurry up.

42:38.983 --> 42:39.983
Go, go, go.

42:40.018 --> 42:42.578
Oh we have a nice big group tonight.

42:42.620 --> 42:43.780
Get in.

42:49.594 --> 42:51.585
- Okay, fasten your seatbelts.
- Wait.

42:51.629 --> 42:52.857
Oh. We have one more.

42:52.897 --> 42:57.561
- Well it's about fucking time.
- I can't believe I'm doing this.

42:57.602 --> 43:00.230
Hi. I'm Lloyd Morgan-Gordon.

43:00.271 --> 43:02.796
This is Larry Morgan-Gordon.
Glad to have you with us.

43:02.841 --> 43:05.366
You'll need one of these.

43:05.410 --> 43:09.506
It may not be an exact match, but...

43:09.547 --> 43:11.014
First time you've all been AWOL?

43:11.049 --> 43:13.483
Larry and Lloyd are ex, ex-gays.

43:13.518 --> 43:15.509
From True Directions?

43:15.553 --> 43:17.418
We were among Mary's ranks
before we defected.

43:17.455 --> 43:21.152
We're just trying to provide you all
with a balanced perspective,

43:21.192 --> 43:22.750
to see that there are options.

43:22.794 --> 43:26.195
In the end it's up to you
whether choose to live a...

43:26.231 --> 43:27.198
lie.

43:27.232 --> 43:28.509
Whether you want
to be who you are

43:28.533 --> 43:31.434
or keep it hidden,
is really more what we're about.

43:31.469 --> 43:34.597

43:42.781 --> 43:44.874

taking me to a gay bar.

43:56.528 --> 43:58.519
Where else would we go?

44:00.398 --> 44:03.265
- I'm gonna get you a drink.
- I don't drink.

44:25.323 --> 44:27.314
I refuse to accept a false
solution to my problem.

44:27.358 --> 44:29.792
I resist temptation
and seek to solve my problem.

44:29.828 --> 44:33.229
- I refuse to accept a false...
- What are you doing?

44:33.264 --> 44:36.995
- My interventions.
- You know you don't have to do that.

So you could be yourself.

Okay, just think.

50:05.530 --> 50:07.521
I already did.

50:07.565 --> 50:10.591
Mine is just as good
as anybody else's.

50:10.635 --> 50:12.603
I'm a heterosexual.

50:12.637 --> 50:15.606
Not yet, honey.
You're almost there.

50:15.640 --> 50:17.665
And don't speak out of turn.

50:17.708 --> 50:19.938
No, I know, I've never been gay.

50:21.045 --> 50:24.242
Jan remember,
you were molested.

50:24.282 --> 50:27.513
Just take a look at yourself.

50:27.552 --> 50:29.543
Everybody thinks I'm this big dyke

50:29.587 --> 50:32.613
because I wear baggy pants,
and play softball,

50:32.657 --> 50:36.991
and I'm not as pretty as other girls,
but that doesn't make me gay.

50:39.030 --> 50:41.658
I like guys.

50:41.699 --> 50:45.260
I can't help it.

50:45.303 --> 50:47.430
I want a big fat wiener up my...

50:47.471 --> 50:49.200
Amen, sister.

50:49.240 --> 50:50.935
(sniffs)

50:50.975 --> 50:52.943
I quit.

50:52.977 --> 50:55.946
Who in the hell
is she trying to fool?

50:56.881 --> 50:58.610
Hey, Jan.

50:58.649 --> 51:00.310
Jan.

51:22.440 --> 51:24.203
Group.

51:24.242 --> 51:28.906
I have found something
very disturbing this morning.

51:30.481 --> 51:32.312
I would like to know

51:32.350 --> 51:34.875
who has been sneaking out,

51:34.919 --> 51:39.117
with those smut peddling
recruiters?

51:39.857 --> 51:41.222
I want names.

51:42.693 --> 51:47.096
I want to know who is involved.

51:49.533 --> 51:50.932
Fine then. Graham?

51:50.968 --> 51:52.765
What do you have to say
for yourself?

51:52.803 --> 51:54.395
Why are you looking at me?

51:54.438 --> 51:56.906
Because I found these
under your bed.

51:59.477 --> 52:01.445
Do you have anything
you'd like to confess?

52:04.115 --> 52:05.776
I didn't sneak out.

52:05.816 --> 52:07.613
But you know who did.

52:08.686 --> 52:10.950
No, I don't, but um...

52:13.824 --> 52:17.089
I did realize something
about myself last night,

52:17.128 --> 52:21.224
that I was too scared
to admit until now.

52:21.265 --> 52:22.755
Out with it.

52:22.800 --> 52:24.563
Come on, out with it.

52:24.602 --> 52:30.199
I have a crush.

52:30.241 --> 52:31.572
On Joel.

52:35.446 --> 52:38.472
It was the first time I really
felt something for a guy.

52:38.516 --> 52:42.816
And it just... it really proved
to me the treatment's working.

52:42.853 --> 52:45.219
Oh, Graham.

52:48.726 --> 52:51.786
Now, let this show you

52:51.829 --> 52:54.923
what determination has yielded.

52:54.966 --> 52:56.934
Fruit.

52:56.968 --> 52:59.664
Now I want you all
to look at Graham's strength,

52:59.704 --> 53:03.003
and how she worked her way
through this five-step program.

53:03.040 --> 53:06.100
And by the way, I am very
disappointed in the rest of you.

53:06.143 --> 53:09.840
And I have scheduled a meeting
with each of your parents.

53:09.880 --> 53:14.681
If you can't listen to me,
then perhaps you'll listen to them.

53:14.719 --> 53:16.812
Joel: No, I didn't go
to the Cocksucker.

53:16.854 --> 53:19.015
I've never been to the Cocksucker.
I won't.

53:19.056 --> 53:21.047
My cocksucking days are over.

53:21.092 --> 53:22.684
I am normal.

53:22.727 --> 53:27.187
Mom, Dad, you have to believe me,
I swear I didn't go anywhere.

53:27.231 --> 53:29.756
You're not gonna tell
your parents are you?

53:33.404 --> 53:35.998
(chimes)

53:36.040 --> 53:37.530
Now, honey,

53:37.575 --> 53:40.305
your mom and I both know

53:40.344 --> 53:43.541
that you didn't have
anything to do with that...

53:43.581 --> 53:45.742
- that...
- Field trip to the Cocksucker.

53:45.783 --> 53:48.775
- Field trip to the Co...

53:48.819 --> 53:52.482
but... if you had gone...

53:52.523 --> 53:56.653
You have to know
that you would be on your own.

53:56.694 --> 53:58.889
What's that supposed to mean?

53:58.929 --> 54:01.625
Well you can't come home.

54:01.665 --> 54:06.159
We can't allow you to live
an unhealthy lifestyle under our roof.

54:07.505 --> 54:11.134
So, Megan, if that
is what you choose,

54:11.175 --> 54:15.202
you're choosing to cut us
out of your life.

54:17.381 --> 54:20.111
Well, great. Great.

54:20.151 --> 54:23.678
Now, what did you
want to tell us?

54:24.755 --> 54:27.383
Just that you don't have
anything worry about.

54:29.794 --> 54:32.695
I've been missing Jared a lot,

54:32.730 --> 54:35.198
and can't wait to see him again.

54:35.232 --> 54:38.895
Oh, Megan. That's wonderful.

54:38.936 --> 54:41.131
You just keep up
the good work,

54:41.172 --> 54:43.697
and we'll be back
to see you graduate.

54:43.741 --> 54:45.572
Dad: You'll be home
before you know it.

54:45.609 --> 54:48.100
Bye-bye, sweetie.

54:49.880 --> 54:53.680
- You be a good girl.
- Goodbye, dear.

54:57.688 --> 54:59.019
Hmph!

55:01.926 --> 55:03.937
(answering machine)
This is Larry and Lloyd Morgan-Gordon.

55:03.961 --> 55:05.952
Leave us a message.
(beep)

55:05.996 --> 55:09.329
I know you're there.
Now pick it up.

55:09.366 --> 55:11.698
Listen to me,
you little inverts.

55:11.735 --> 55:14.465
Okay, you want to play
rough with my kids,

55:14.505 --> 55:17.201
then I can play rough with you.

55:17.241 --> 55:19.675
- Time's up.
- Yes, thank you.

55:22.179 --> 55:24.841
We've got a little situation
to deal with.

55:24.882 --> 55:26.907

Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve!

55:26.951 --> 55:28.885
Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve!

55:28.919 --> 55:30.978
Mary:
You have other options.

55:31.021 --> 55:34.115
Don't you want to be normal?

55:34.158 --> 55:38.652
Hey, I know you.
I saw you last night.

55:38.696 --> 55:42.257
Hey!
Your daddy know you're a faggot?

55:42.299 --> 55:44.529
Good shot, Graham.

55:44.568 --> 55:46.695
What are you doing?

55:46.737 --> 55:48.932
What if he saw us kissing?
What do you want me to do?

55:48.973 --> 55:51.237
We're not queer!
We're not going anywhere!

55:51.275 --> 55:54.870
We are here! We're not queer!
We're not going anywhere!

55:54.912 --> 55:59.076
That's it. If you don't retreat,
we're coming out.

55:59.116 --> 56:01.107
(screaming)

56:02.920 --> 56:06.720
Is this what you teach now, Mary?
Throw stones from glass houses?

56:06.757 --> 56:09.248
You're gonna have a lot
of broken glass around you.

56:09.293 --> 56:12.091
It's part of the process, Lloyd.

56:12.129 --> 56:14.757
It's not easy for them.

56:30.781 --> 56:34.182
- Excuse me
- Oh, thanks.

56:34.218 --> 56:37.051
You are so good
at being straight.

56:37.087 --> 56:40.887
Wow. You have really
big muscles.

56:40.925 --> 56:44.759
I keep forgetting about
all these little things.

56:44.795 --> 56:48.253
Get her cake.
Get her the cake.

56:48.299 --> 56:50.426
Can I rub them?

56:50.467 --> 56:52.594
Got a little cake right there.

57:04.515 --> 57:05.948
That's good.

57:08.986 --> 57:10.783
Oh. Yeah.

57:10.821 --> 57:13.756
Mm-mm.

57:16.393 --> 57:18.384
You're really manly.

57:18.429 --> 57:20.420
- Thanks.
- I like that.

57:20.464 --> 57:22.694
- Manly is good.
- I feel like the aggressor.

57:22.733 --> 57:25.827
That's nice.

57:25.869 --> 57:28.463
Yeah.

57:34.011 --> 57:35.876
You will all

57:35.913 --> 57:38.438
be graded in each category,

57:38.482 --> 57:42.475
and those of you who pass,
will move on to step five,

57:42.519 --> 57:46.649
simulated sexual lifestyle.

57:46.690 --> 57:50.456

one must first enter a life

01:04:26.790 --> 01:04:28.917
You hormonal hussy.

01:04:28.959 --> 01:04:30.927
I can't believe you did this.

01:04:30.961 --> 01:04:32.405
You were suppose to be
the role model.

01:04:32.429 --> 01:04:34.863
Now get up right now!

01:04:34.898 --> 01:04:37.025
What did I do?

01:04:37.067 --> 01:04:39.627
Hilary:
A little sleep-over with Graham.

01:04:39.670 --> 01:04:41.160
(scoffs)

01:04:41.204 --> 01:04:43.604
Get dressed right now!

01:04:46.009 --> 01:04:47.271
Mary:
You of course understand

01:04:47.310 --> 01:04:49.938
what your little adventure
has cost you.

01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:53.814
You will be removed from the program,
and the premises at once.

01:04:53.850 --> 01:04:56.182
I understand.

01:04:56.219 --> 01:04:59.017
And of course your parents
have made it very clear

01:04:59.056 --> 01:05:00.990
that you are just not
welcome home any more.

01:05:01.024 --> 01:05:04.084
So you will be left
to your own devices.

01:05:05.996 --> 01:05:09.056
I mean there may be one thing
that you can do,

01:05:09.099 --> 01:05:11.363
where we can workout
some kind of a deal.

01:05:11.401 --> 01:05:13.198
I'll let you stay,

01:05:13.236 --> 01:05:15.204
and graduate with the rest
your class,

01:05:15.238 --> 01:05:18.173
but you must do me
one favor in return.

01:05:18.208 --> 01:05:19.732
Partner in simulation
with Rock.

01:05:19.776 --> 01:05:20.776
Rock?

01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:25.270
I don't think that'll work.

01:05:25.315 --> 01:05:27.215

01:05:31.888 --> 01:05:33.355

01:05:38.729 --> 01:05:42.665
Rock, turn it off.

01:05:47.404 --> 01:05:48.894
We've lost Megan.

01:05:48.939 --> 01:05:51.203
She just wasn't
strong enough.

01:05:51.241 --> 01:05:54.233
But you still have a chance
to save yourself.

01:05:54.277 --> 01:05:55.539
It's your choice.

01:05:55.579 --> 01:05:59.071
You can run off with Megan
and turn into a raging bull-dyke

01:05:59.116 --> 01:06:01.914
or you can do the simulation
and graduate,

01:06:01.952 --> 01:06:03.920
and lead a normal life.

01:06:03.954 --> 01:06:05.581
There is no choice.

01:06:05.622 --> 01:06:07.419
You came here to graduate,

01:06:07.457 --> 01:06:10.085
and that is exactly
what you are going to do.

01:06:10.127 --> 01:06:11.617
You understand me,
young lady?

01:06:12.662 --> 01:06:14.960
This is exactly
why your mother left.

01:06:14.998 --> 01:06:17.262
Are you ready to lose
your father?

01:06:41.291 --> 01:06:42.883
Then it's settled.

01:06:42.926 --> 01:06:45.759
Graham will partner with Rock
in simulation.

01:06:45.796 --> 01:06:48.629
Megan, you're out.

01:06:48.665 --> 01:06:50.599
Skedaddle.

01:06:53.036 --> 01:06:55.163
(softly)
I'm sorry.

01:07:36.079 --> 01:07:37.376
Man:
What do you want?

01:07:37.414 --> 01:07:39.279
I need to talk
to Lloyd and Larry.

01:07:39.316 --> 01:07:41.113
But you're from True Directions.

01:07:41.151 --> 01:07:42.641
- Yeah.
- (window shuts)

01:07:42.686 --> 01:07:44.381
Hey, not anymore.

01:07:47.090 --> 01:07:49.957
All right, kid,
get in here.

01:07:49.993 --> 01:07:51.824
Come on, move your tush.

01:07:54.064 --> 01:07:55.463
I can't go back.

01:07:55.498 --> 01:07:58.365
I thought you could teach me
how to be a lesbian,

01:07:58.401 --> 01:08:01.336
what they wear,
where they live.

01:08:01.371 --> 01:08:02.565
You know.

01:08:03.874 --> 01:08:05.933
Megan, we can't
help you with that.

01:08:05.976 --> 01:08:09.207
There's not just one way
to be a lesbian.

01:08:09.246 --> 01:08:12.841
You just have to continue
to be who you are.

01:08:14.818 --> 01:08:16.649
- Dolph?
- Megan.

01:08:19.022 --> 01:08:21.684
Thank you so much for saving me
from that place.

01:08:21.725 --> 01:08:23.215
What are you doing here?

01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:24.386
I live here.

01:08:24.426 --> 01:08:27.760
Or at least until I find a way
to make it on my own.

01:08:29.799 --> 01:08:31.357
It's way better than TD.

01:08:31.401 --> 01:08:34.801
We all get our own rooms
and curfew is midnight.

01:08:34.837 --> 01:08:36.600
But we have to share bathrooms.

01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:38.198
Not at the same time,
of course.

01:08:38.241 --> 01:08:39.765
Of course.

01:08:40.810 --> 01:08:42.243
Come on,
it's going to be okay.

01:08:42.279 --> 01:08:43.939
No it won't.

01:08:47.017 --> 01:08:49.577
She was supposed to leave with me
and she didn't.

01:08:50.587 --> 01:08:52.578
Whoa, slow down, who?

01:08:52.622 --> 01:08:53.645
Graham.

01:08:53.689 --> 01:08:55.180
I knew it.

01:08:55.225 --> 01:08:57.557
She was into you
from the start.

01:08:57.594 --> 01:08:59.255
Then why didn't she
come with me?

01:08:59.296 --> 01:09:00.991
Maybe she was scared.

01:09:01.031 --> 01:09:02.692
Like I'm not?

01:09:02.732 --> 01:09:05.758
Believe me,
you're better off here.

01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:13.868
Mary:
Graham?

01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:15.877
Pay attention.

01:09:15.912 --> 01:09:17.277
Action, Rock.

01:09:28.457 --> 01:09:30.187
Now lean in and kiss her.

01:09:32.895 --> 01:09:34.090
Nice, Rock.

01:09:34.130 --> 01:09:37.759
Now, feel how soft
and vulnerable she is.

01:09:37.801 --> 01:09:39.428
Isn't it wonderful?

01:09:39.469 --> 01:09:40.868
Now, Graham,

01:09:40.904 --> 01:09:43.202
let him take the lead.

01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:46.768
A little tongue...

01:09:46.810 --> 01:09:49.745
He loves you.
He wants to be with you.

01:09:49.779 --> 01:09:52.111
The way God intended.

01:09:52.148 --> 01:09:54.810
To be inside you.

01:09:54.851 --> 01:09:57.149
His love muscle thrusting.

01:09:57.187 --> 01:09:58.586
(both scoff)

01:09:59.789 --> 01:10:00.789
Cut.

01:10:00.824 --> 01:10:03.554
Megan, we thought that Dolph
should take you out this week,

01:10:03.593 --> 01:10:05.288
to celebrate your
new freedom.

01:10:05.328 --> 01:10:07.558
- How would that be?
- Sure.

01:10:07.597 --> 01:10:08.996
So, Megan...

01:10:09.032 --> 01:10:11.159
what do you want
to do now?

01:10:11.201 --> 01:10:14.796
Larry, Megan just made
a very traumatic decision

01:10:14.838 --> 01:10:17.739
- and she's moving through that process.
- I thought that...

01:10:17.774 --> 01:10:20.004
we could check out
some schools in the city,

01:10:20.043 --> 01:10:22.944
- and I could...
- She's not ready...

01:10:22.979 --> 01:10:24.105
Sweetie.

01:10:24.147 --> 01:10:26.809
I'm just asking
a simple question.

01:10:26.850 --> 01:10:28.894
- I'm not interrogating her.
- You are moving into that

01:10:28.918 --> 01:10:31.430
- aggressive space again.
- Can't I even ask a question around here?

01:10:31.454 --> 01:10:33.445
Now I feel you moving
into your victim stance.

01:10:33.490 --> 01:10:38.018
I was not attacking,
I was verbalizing.

01:10:39.162 --> 01:10:42.325
I just feel like you don't
value my opinion anymore.

01:10:42.365 --> 01:10:44.697
Seems like nothing I do
pleases you.

01:10:45.802 --> 01:10:48.134
I feel inadequate.

01:10:49.806 --> 01:10:52.331
I love my Larry bear.

01:10:53.443 --> 01:10:56.537
- Lloyd's sorry.
- Larry bear's sorry, too.

01:11:02.085 --> 01:11:04.383
Okay then.
Dinner's ready.

01:11:05.388 --> 01:11:08.050
Very good.
Okay, who's next?

01:11:19.169 --> 01:11:22.366
Okay, now remember
that sex is fun.

01:11:22.405 --> 01:11:24.134
We're making love.

01:11:24.174 --> 01:11:26.233
There's nothing dirty
about it.

01:11:26.276 --> 01:11:29.609
Sex is beautiful when it's
between a man and a woman.

01:11:29.646 --> 01:11:30.977
Mom?

01:11:31.014 --> 01:11:33.278
Okay,
now from this position,

01:11:33.316 --> 01:11:34.908
the woman will
spread her legs,

01:11:34.951 --> 01:11:37.010
opening like a flower.

01:11:37.053 --> 01:11:38.543
That's wonderful Graham.

01:11:38.588 --> 01:11:41.989
Now at this point,
the man will insert himself

01:11:42.025 --> 01:11:43.356
into the woman.

01:11:49.432 --> 01:11:50.797
Yes, that's...

01:11:50.834 --> 01:11:52.734
Yes. Rock that's it.

01:11:52.769 --> 01:11:54.828
Mrs. Brown?

01:11:54.871 --> 01:11:56.236
What is it, Joel?

01:11:56.272 --> 01:11:59.537
- What about foreplay?
- Foreplay is for sissies.

01:11:59.576 --> 01:12:02.739
Real men go in,
unload and pull out.

01:12:02.779 --> 01:12:04.076
Mom!

01:12:16.759 --> 01:12:18.317
We could dance
if you want to.

01:12:20.797 --> 01:12:22.162
You go ahead.

01:12:23.333 --> 01:12:25.426
I think I need to go get some air.

01:12:40.683 --> 01:12:42.150
I miss her.

01:12:44.654 --> 01:12:47.350
She's scared that maybe
she's making the wrong choice.

01:12:47.390 --> 01:12:48.601
But it's her wrong
choice to make.

01:12:48.625 --> 01:12:50.957
You have to be willing
to walk away.

01:12:52.762 --> 01:12:55.526
What about you and Clayton?

01:12:55.565 --> 01:12:58.591
If he can't make a stand,
he just can't make a stand.

01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:05.367
Well, what about you?

01:13:06.543 --> 01:13:08.602
What are you willing to do?

01:13:15.919 --> 01:13:18.183
I'm so proud of you.

01:13:18.221 --> 01:13:20.519
Doesn't it feel great
to be straight?

01:13:20.557 --> 01:13:24.152
To be out of homosexuality?

01:13:24.194 --> 01:13:26.890
It's not always
gonna be easy,

01:13:26.930 --> 01:13:29.398
but at least we know
what to do now.

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:32.391
Okay, girls,
ready to go?

01:13:35.738 --> 01:13:36.864
Give me the keys.

01:13:36.906 --> 01:13:39.272
- I hope she's worth it.
- Is Clayton?

01:13:39.309 --> 01:13:41.174
I'm doing this for you,
not for Clayton.

01:13:41.211 --> 01:13:42.473
Yeah, right.

01:13:50.186 --> 01:13:51.949
There he is.

01:14:21.150 --> 01:14:22.777
Let's go.

01:14:41.104 --> 01:14:45.837
Mary: Welcome to the graduating class
of True Directions.

01:14:48.211 --> 01:14:51.203
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I present

01:14:51.247 --> 01:14:54.546
our happy heterosexuals.

01:14:54.584 --> 01:14:56.176
(applause)

01:15:22.879 --> 01:15:24.574
- Jesus.
- Miss me?

01:15:24.614 --> 01:15:26.138
Why are you here?

01:15:26.182 --> 01:15:27.649
I came to get you.

01:15:29.986 --> 01:15:32.716
I can't go anywhere, Megan.

01:15:58.648 --> 01:16:00.343
That was fast.

01:16:00.383 --> 01:16:01.577
Where's Graham?

01:16:03.419 --> 01:16:04.750
I've got to try again.

01:16:16.032 --> 01:16:18.296
We have all gathered
on this special day,

01:16:18.334 --> 01:16:22.395
to celebrate the wonderful
true directions.

01:16:25.875 --> 01:16:29.367
And praise be
to our Higher Power.

01:16:31.681 --> 01:16:34.616
Will our graduates
please stand again?

01:16:35.952 --> 01:16:37.442
Sinead Lauren.

01:16:44.794 --> 01:16:46.193
Joel Goldberg.

01:16:55.371 --> 01:16:57.032
Hilary Vandermueller.

01:17:04.013 --> 01:17:05.742
Graham Eaton.

01:17:29.872 --> 01:17:32.705
And now,
I think that in closing...

01:17:32.742 --> 01:17:34.334
we should...

01:17:44.554 --> 01:17:45.612
Graham.

01:17:52.195 --> 01:17:54.390
One, two, three, four,

01:17:54.430 --> 01:17:56.796
I won't take "no" anymore.

01:17:56.833 --> 01:17:58.926
Five, six, seven, eight,

01:17:58.968 --> 01:18:01.266
I want you to be my mate.

01:18:01.304 --> 01:18:03.795
One, two, three, four,

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:06.104
You're the one that I adore.

01:18:06.142 --> 01:18:08.576
Five, six, seven, eight,

01:18:08.611 --> 01:18:11.637
