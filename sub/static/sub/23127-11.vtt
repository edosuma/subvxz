00:01.000 --> 00:02.923
- (Aidan): Previously
on Being Human...

00:02.969 --> 00:05.393
- Janet, this is all my fault.

00:05.430 --> 00:08.695
You're not crazy.

00:08.740 --> 00:09.730
- Reaper.

00:09.770 --> 00:10.737
(Screaming)

00:10.770 --> 00:12.807
- I'm never gonna be like you!

00:12.840 --> 00:14.672
- You did things.
Horrible things.

00:14.710 --> 00:16.542
- (Reaper):
Don't you get it, Sally?

00:16.580 --> 00:18.207
- You are me.

00:18.250 --> 00:19.320
I want you gone.

00:19.350 --> 00:20.511
- It's not that simple.

00:20.550 --> 00:22.746
- My last girlfriend,
Nora, she's a wolf.

00:22.790 --> 00:23.746
(Growling)

00:23.790 --> 00:26.452
- You want to be human
and I don't think I do.

00:26.490 --> 00:27.855
- So you'd give up on us?

00:27.890 --> 00:29.654
- Josh?
- Julia.

00:29.690 --> 00:31.556
- Julia the fiance?

00:31.590 --> 00:35.527
- I either bring her in closer
or I break her heart.

00:35.560 --> 00:38.268
- Aidan, you will be
my daughter's second.

00:38.300 --> 00:41.133
In return, I would be willing
to grant you freedom.

00:45.140 --> 00:47.370
- People love that clich:

00:47.410 --> 00:50.175
"Time heals all wounds."

00:50.210 --> 00:52.269
When Mother arrives,
she'll want to meet our police

00:52.320 --> 00:54.379
and she'll wanna
tour the house

00:54.420 --> 00:55.672
where the orphans
were dealt with.

00:55.720 --> 00:57.484
- I've also taken
care of the entertainment.

00:57.520 --> 01:00.558
Just a small feast of
Boston's tastiest blood whores.

01:00.590 --> 01:04.254
Mother can sample down the line
like it's a flight of tequila.

01:04.290 --> 01:06.395
We don't want her
to get bored, do we?

01:06.430 --> 01:07.454
- No, boring is good.

01:07.500 --> 01:08.854
Boring means
business as usual

01:08.900 --> 01:11.494
and that's exactly
what we want her to see.

01:11.530 --> 01:13.635
This is as far as you go.
- Are you serious?

01:13.670 --> 01:16.605
I gave my skin to get
back into this family.

01:16.640 --> 01:18.108
Doesn't that
afford me the right

01:18.140 --> 01:20.472
to do anything more than follow
you around and open doors?

01:20.510 --> 01:22.842
- You're back, Henry,
and I'm glad you're back,

01:22.880 --> 01:24.370
but it's only
been a few weeks.

01:24.410 --> 01:25.548
You can't blame Suren

01:25.580 --> 01:29.187
if she still can't bear
the sight of you.

01:29.220 --> 01:31.814
Keep your cool.

01:31.850 --> 01:34.182
It might take
2 or 3 decades,

01:34.220 --> 01:35.517
but you'll move up.

01:35.560 --> 01:37.654
But live long enough,

01:37.690 --> 01:40.694
you realize that
most clichs are true.

01:40.730 --> 01:43.222
- Please, allow me.

01:43.270 --> 01:45.261
It's what I live for.

01:47.500 --> 01:48.934
- I'm sorry I'm late.

01:48.970 --> 01:52.406
I've been going over
preparations for Mother.

01:52.440 --> 01:54.670
- I should have waited
to invite her.

01:54.710 --> 01:56.906
- No, no. It's time.
The orphans are gone.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.817
Boston is running again
with precision.

01:59.850 --> 02:01.318
It's flawless.

02:01.350 --> 02:04.547
- Suppose Mother comes
and likes what she sees.

02:04.590 --> 02:05.944
What then?

02:05.990 --> 02:07.458
I get more power?

02:07.490 --> 02:09.549
I get seated
in a bigger city,

02:09.590 --> 02:10.920
the East Coast maybe.

02:10.960 --> 02:13.691
- Aren't you getting the
slightest bit ahead of yourself?

02:13.730 --> 02:16.859
- Mother is going to
give you your freedom.

02:16.900 --> 02:19.540
You could use it
to come with me.

02:19.570 --> 02:22.403
I haven't seen
the world in 80 years.

02:22.440 --> 02:24.829
I want to see
it with you.

02:26.440 --> 02:27.908
- (Aidan):
It's amazing what

02:27.940 --> 02:31.444
even the smallest passage
of time can accomplish,

02:31.480 --> 02:33.414
the cuts it can close,

02:33.450 --> 02:35.669
the imperfections
it can smooth over.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.449
- Wow! We are so hardcore,

02:37.490 --> 02:39.549
I think we've shut this place
down 3 nights in a row.

02:39.590 --> 02:40.955
(Chuckling)

02:40.990 --> 02:42.253
You could come over.

02:42.290 --> 02:43.257
- I can't.

02:43.290 --> 02:44.451
I have to go home

02:44.490 --> 02:46.925
and check on
my water heater.

02:46.960 --> 02:48.519
(Screeching)

02:48.560 --> 02:49.994
I'm sorry.

02:50.030 --> 02:52.795
- Josh, you need to quit
apologizing for everything.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.296
(Grunts)

02:54.340 --> 02:57.435
Your water heater,
my salad earlier, the rain.

02:57.470 --> 02:58.437
- That is my fault.

02:58.470 --> 02:59.608
- I get it.

02:59.640 --> 03:01.278
You feel bad.

03:01.310 --> 03:03.244
- You know,
you could come over.

03:03.280 --> 03:04.247
- No, I--

03:04.280 --> 03:06.419
I really can't.

03:06.450 --> 03:07.611
- Because of Aidan.

03:07.650 --> 03:09.345
(Thunder rumbling)

03:09.390 --> 03:13.509
That was months ago
and you're with me now again.

03:14.790 --> 03:16.884
After everything
we've been through,

03:16.930 --> 03:18.989
and everything that...

03:20.000 --> 03:21.627
I did,

03:21.660 --> 03:24.698
I think we've overcome
a pretty major hurdle,

03:24.730 --> 03:27.336
and Aidan is
just a tiny hurdle.

03:27.370 --> 03:30.362
- It's not so much what
happened with Aidan,

03:30.410 --> 03:33.778
it's how he treated me
after it happened.

03:33.810 --> 03:35.778
- I told you
that's my fault.

03:35.810 --> 03:38.609
- You made him talk to me
like I was a whore?

03:38.650 --> 03:41.119
- I did not do that.

03:41.150 --> 03:42.618
- I can appreciate how much

03:42.650 --> 03:44.687
he respects his
friendship with you,

03:44.720 --> 03:47.212
but I still
kind of hate him.

03:50.860 --> 03:52.954
Good luck with
your water heater.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.297
- But in the end,

03:54.330 --> 03:58.494
it comes down to the size
of the wound, doesn't it?

03:58.530 --> 03:59.759
If the wound is deep enough,

03:59.800 --> 04:01.791
there might be no way
to keep it from festering,

04:01.840 --> 04:05.231
even if you have
all the time in the world.

04:05.270 --> 04:07.534
- (Man on TV): Tonight,
on Paranormal Witness...

04:07.580 --> 04:08.809
- You should go
on that show.

04:08.840 --> 04:12.845
If only they knew
how much we liked people.

04:12.880 --> 04:15.850
- (Woman): Something was just
not right with the house.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.882
- You can't ignore me
forever, Sally.

04:19.860 --> 04:23.490
- I just felt very unsettled.

04:25.390 --> 04:29.600
And then,
the nightmares started.

04:29.630 --> 04:33.498
** T won't lie *

04:39.610 --> 04:40.736
(TV volume loud)

04:40.780 --> 04:43.579
- (Man): I didn't understand
what I just saw.

04:43.610 --> 04:44.873
Something stepped
in front of me.

04:44.910 --> 04:48.517
- I feel like I'm watching
stories with my Meemaw!

04:48.550 --> 04:50.780
- Sorry. I was trying
to drown out the Reaper.

04:50.820 --> 04:52.356
- These are things
I can't explain...

04:52.390 --> 04:54.984
- Wait. Whoa,
whoa, whoa! He's here?

04:55.020 --> 04:58.183
- No, not right now.
He comes and goes.

04:58.230 --> 05:00.722
Could we not talk
about him, please?

05:00.760 --> 05:02.626
Or me,
for that matter?

05:02.670 --> 05:04.866
- History shows that
us ignoring your problems

05:04.900 --> 05:06.868
doesn't really work
out well for anyone,

05:06.900 --> 05:08.868
so, if you don't mind,

05:08.900 --> 05:11.938
we will maintain the current
level of care and concern.

05:11.970 --> 05:13.699
- We just wanna
help you get better.

05:13.740 --> 05:16.903
- I don't think there is any
getting better from this.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.702
I shredded ghosts.

05:18.750 --> 05:21.640
I robbed them of any
chance they had at moving on.

05:21.680 --> 05:23.887
And it's not just ghosts.

05:23.920 --> 05:27.857
I wrecked the lives of
people who were actually alive.

05:32.830 --> 05:34.628
What?

05:34.660 --> 05:36.469
I saw that look.

05:36.500 --> 05:38.719
What--what do you know?

05:38.770 --> 05:41.137
- Uh, Janet,
Dr. Forest's girlfriend...

05:41.170 --> 05:42.137
- Mm-hmm?

05:42.170 --> 05:43.729
- ...she was, uh, brought

05:43.770 --> 05:45.829
into the hospital
a week ago

05:45.870 --> 05:47.804
to the, uh,
psychiatric ward.

05:47.840 --> 05:51.378
- Oh my god! Why wouldn't
you tell me this?

05:51.410 --> 05:52.844
- You'd been
through enough.

05:52.880 --> 05:54.177
We didn't wanna
make you feel guilty.

05:54.220 --> 05:56.484
- Well, I am guilty,
aren't 1?

05:56.520 --> 05:58.943
She's in the psyche ward
because I possessed her.

06:05.660 --> 06:07.150
- Hey.

06:07.200 --> 06:11.899
So, I want to invite Julia over
for dinner tomorrow night

06:11.930 --> 06:13.762
and I would like it
if you could be there too.

06:13.800 --> 06:16.963
- Well, that sounds like
it could be weird.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.466
- Exactly, yes.

06:18.510 --> 06:20.478
I need to get the two
of you in a room together

06:20.510 --> 06:23.207
and confront any mutual
weirdness that there might be,

06:23.250 --> 06:26.049
just slap it
in the face.

06:26.080 --> 06:27.878
Please, man. Listen.

06:27.920 --> 06:31.015
I need to take this thing
to the next stage with her.

06:31.050 --> 06:33.883
- What next stage?
You already slept with her.

06:33.920 --> 06:36.685
- That wasn't me.
Stu stole my penis.

06:37.660 --> 06:39.025
Yeah.

06:39.060 --> 06:40.550
And besides, this isn't
about sleeping together,

06:40.600 --> 06:41.658
it's about estab--

06:41.700 --> 06:45.591
Re-establishing an
honest-to-God relationship.

06:45.630 --> 06:47.132
- With a woman that
you were gonna marry.

06:47.170 --> 06:49.832
Aren't you rushing
this a little bit?

06:49.870 --> 06:51.838
Look, Josh, I know that
it hurt when Nora left.

06:51.870 --> 06:55.875
- This has nothing to do
with Nora. This is about me.

06:55.910 --> 06:57.799
This is my do-over, man.

06:57.850 --> 07:00.512
Julia is decent

07:00.550 --> 07:04.339
and beautiful
and normal.

07:05.590 --> 07:07.319
- Fine, T'll do it.
- Fantastic!

07:07.360 --> 07:08.282
- I'll bring Suren.

07:08.320 --> 07:09.628
We'll double.
- Awful.

07:09.660 --> 07:11.480
- You're not the only one who's
digging up bones here, you know.

07:11.530 --> 07:15.489
80 years ago, Suren and I,
we had something strong.

07:15.530 --> 07:17.168
In present day,
it's complicated

07:17.200 --> 07:18.099
and I need to know

07:18.130 --> 07:21.691
if we can have something
beyond circumstance,

07:21.740 --> 07:23.868
see if she can do with the
mundane parts of my life.

07:23.910 --> 07:25.799
- OK, I'm gonna blow
past the fact

07:25.840 --> 07:27.638
that you just
called me mundane,

07:27.680 --> 07:30.240
and agree to this deal.

07:30.280 --> 07:32.146
- Make sure you tell
Suren about Julia.

07:32.180 --> 07:33.648
- Why?

07:33.680 --> 07:35.273
- Well, there
are certain

07:35.320 --> 07:36.947
golden rules to
a relationship,

07:36.990 --> 07:39.755
one being never put your
current girlfriend in a room

07:39.790 --> 07:41.918
with an old girlfriend
without warning her.

07:41.960 --> 07:42.722
- Well, Julia's--

07:42.760 --> 07:45.183
- No! No, this is
a very good idea,

07:45.230 --> 07:47.699
especially when
the new girlfriend

07:47.730 --> 07:50.028
could potentially eat
the old girlfriend.

08:03.680 --> 08:07.241
- They just come to me,
like memories.

08:07.280 --> 08:09.647
That's the house I lived in.

08:09.690 --> 08:14.856
I mean, I've never
lived there, but I have.

08:14.890 --> 08:17.325
- And what about
this woman?

08:17.360 --> 08:19.590
How do you know her?

08:19.630 --> 08:20.950
- Mom.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.126
- I don't know.

08:22.160 --> 08:23.924
But I love her.

08:23.970 --> 08:25.927
- In what way?

08:27.340 --> 08:30.207
I-- I think that's enough
for today. All right?

08:30.240 --> 08:32.059
- You could help her,
you know?

08:34.080 --> 08:36.071
You could go back into Janet.

08:36.110 --> 08:38.602
- No, I can't do that.

08:38.650 --> 08:41.914
- Well, at least you're
talking to me again.

08:41.950 --> 08:44.009
It makes sense
and you know it.

08:44.049 --> 08:46.314
You slip inside her,
answer the shrink's questions,

08:46.350 --> 08:48.785
just tell her what
she wants to hear.

08:48.820 --> 08:51.619
Janet would be out of this
nut hut in a matter of days.

08:54.230 --> 08:56.221
- Absolutely not!

08:56.260 --> 08:58.820
I am not playing telephone
for you and Janet.

08:58.870 --> 09:00.292
- Josh, please!

09:00.340 --> 09:03.037
I just need to let Janet
know that she's not insane!

09:03.070 --> 09:05.129
- By telling her
she was possessed?

09:05.170 --> 09:06.899
- She deserves
to know the truth.

09:06.940 --> 09:10.149
- The truth to the normal
people of this world

09:10.180 --> 09:12.308
is that Janet is a woman
who had a break with reality.

09:12.350 --> 09:15.741
If she gets further entrenched
in the belief that you're real,

09:15.780 --> 09:17.339
she won't make
any progress,

09:17.390 --> 09:18.789
and neither will you.

09:18.820 --> 09:20.049
- This isn't about me.

09:20.090 --> 09:22.309
- But it is.
It's all about you.

09:22.360 --> 09:25.057
You wanna fix Janet
so you don't feel so bad,

09:25.090 --> 09:27.957
but what you did
is just as bad for you.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.594
You were addicted
to being her, Sally.

09:34.340 --> 09:36.900
- What will we be eating?

09:36.940 --> 09:37.907
- Does it matter?

09:37.940 --> 09:40.204
- I'm just a bit
overwhelmed.

09:40.240 --> 09:42.902
Mother will be here tomorrow and
instead of making preparations,

09:42.950 --> 09:46.170
I'm sitting down at a table
with a ghost and a dog.

09:46.210 --> 09:47.177
- OK, listen.

09:47.220 --> 09:49.712
You need to
remember this:

09:49.750 --> 09:51.844
Josh is not a dog.
He's not a wolf.

09:51.890 --> 09:53.187
He's my closest friend.

09:53.220 --> 09:56.155
Things are gonna change
after Mother's visit.

09:56.190 --> 09:59.057
Things between us are
gonna be more about us.

09:59.090 --> 10:01.252
And so, if we're
gonna be together,

10:01.300 --> 10:03.860
you have to learn
to accept my friends.

10:03.900 --> 10:07.666
- Of course, and your
roommate's girlfriend, Julia.

10:07.700 --> 10:09.805
She's human.

10:09.840 --> 10:12.366
- Yes, she's very human.

10:12.410 --> 10:15.436
- Do you think it's fair
for her to sit down at a table,

10:15.480 --> 10:18.609
share a meal with us,
completely blinded to the truth?

10:20.120 --> 10:22.043
- Listen, about Julia--

10:22.080 --> 10:23.912
(Sighing)

10:28.620 --> 10:30.452
- Are you guys gonna
stand out here all night,

10:30.490 --> 10:31.719
let my chicken get cold?

10:31.760 --> 10:34.752
- Josh, this is Suren.
Suren, Josh.

10:34.800 --> 10:35.756
- Hi.

10:35.800 --> 10:37.325
I'm Sally.

10:37.370 --> 10:39.896
- Oh! Hello.

10:39.940 --> 10:44.104
- Suren, please come
inside of my house.

10:50.080 --> 10:52.913
- Uh, it's gonna be great.

10:52.950 --> 10:55.248
(Sighing)

11:05.760 --> 11:08.058
- This is painful!

11:08.100 --> 11:11.195
Somebody talk before
I start watching loud TV!

11:13.970 --> 11:15.369
- Julia!

11:16.400 --> 11:19.461
Um, I wanted to ask you
how--how--how, um,

11:19.510 --> 11:21.774
how are you adjusting
to the hospital?

11:21.810 --> 11:23.141
- Oh, God!

11:23.180 --> 11:26.104
- Well, it's been 3 months
since we last spoke,

11:26.150 --> 11:27.777
so the adjustment's
pretty much over.

11:27.820 --> 11:28.810
(Josh coughs)

11:28.850 --> 11:30.887
- It's a funny thing
about roast chicken.

11:33.560 --> 11:36.382
Everyone always assumes
it's about the spices,

11:36.420 --> 11:38.855
but really,
it's the slow cooking,

11:38.890 --> 11:41.825
that you-- to really seal
in those juices.

11:41.860 --> 11:45.490
- And that's probably
why it's so delicious.

11:45.530 --> 11:46.964
- Mmm!

11:47.000 --> 11:48.365
It is.

11:48.400 --> 11:49.868
- Thank you.

11:49.910 --> 11:52.038
- And you keep such
a clean home, Josh.

11:52.070 --> 11:55.529
I'm impressed.
You're a credit to your kind.

11:55.580 --> 11:57.378
(Julia clearing throat)

11:57.410 --> 12:00.380
- What's his kind? Jewish?

12:00.420 --> 12:04.209
- Dude-ish! Right?
'Cause he's a dude and he's--

12:04.250 --> 12:06.344
He's a clean dude
and dudes are messy.

12:06.390 --> 12:07.585
It's just a fact.

12:07.620 --> 12:11.124
- This conversation
is not better.

12:11.160 --> 12:13.959
- So, how do you two
know each other?

12:14.000 --> 12:16.765
- Aidan used to work
for my family,

12:16.800 --> 12:18.768
mainly keeping
an eye on me.

12:18.800 --> 12:20.495
I was always
getting in trouble,

12:20.540 --> 12:22.030
because it was the only way
to get his attention.

12:22.070 --> 12:23.469
- Yeah, right.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.160
- You have no idea how long

12:25.210 --> 12:26.871
I've loved you,
do you?

12:29.540 --> 12:33.044
- How long? How long
have you loved him?

12:33.080 --> 12:36.414
- My mother and I have
always been hot and cold.

12:36.450 --> 12:39.442
Uh, after one
particular blow up,

12:39.490 --> 12:41.049
Mother wanted to make peace.

12:41.090 --> 12:42.558
She gave me a black orchid.

12:42.590 --> 12:43.625
- Oh!

12:43.660 --> 12:45.185
- Very delicate
flower, the orchid.

12:45.230 --> 12:48.598
Well, I was determined
to let it die

12:48.630 --> 12:51.861
out of some form
of foolish protest.

12:51.900 --> 12:54.597
So I refused to water it,
denied it light,

12:54.640 --> 12:57.166
and yet, day after day,
it thrived.

12:57.210 --> 13:01.909
And then I saw
someone tending to it.

13:01.940 --> 13:03.999
- You saw that?

13:04.050 --> 13:07.111
- I wasn't sure if you were
trying to keep the peace

13:07.150 --> 13:08.970
for the sake of
keeping the peace,

13:09.020 --> 13:10.943
or you were trying
to protect me,

13:10.990 --> 13:14.085
but watching you care
for that flower...

13:17.790 --> 13:20.794
- Julia and I were
co-captains of the speech team.

13:20.830 --> 13:22.298
(Julia clearing throat)

13:22.330 --> 13:23.627
- We were.

13:23.670 --> 13:24.626
(All laughing)

13:24.670 --> 13:27.799
- Forgive me.
I'm sharing too much.

13:27.840 --> 13:30.537
- Uh, TV?
Do you watch any TV?

13:30.570 --> 13:32.106
- She doesn't--
- Antiques Roadshow.

13:32.140 --> 13:34.734
- Really? Antiques Roadshow!

13:34.780 --> 13:36.874
You watch Antiques Roadshow?

13:36.910 --> 13:40.244
That is literally my
favourite program, hands down.

13:40.280 --> 13:42.612
- He loves it.
- What's his name?

13:42.650 --> 13:44.243
Rudy Franchi? Man is a god.

13:44.290 --> 13:46.247
- Husky, but knowledgeable.

13:46.290 --> 13:48.588
- Bring her over more.

13:48.620 --> 13:49.883
Husky!

13:49.930 --> 13:50.954
Am I really high,

13:50.990 --> 13:52.287
or did we just
pull this thing off?

13:52.330 --> 13:55.391
- I stopped wanting to claw
my eyes out by dessert.

13:55.430 --> 13:56.750
- Yeah, I think we're good.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.723
- May I ask you a question?
- Sure?

13:58.770 --> 14:03.003
- Does Josh know you and
Aidan have been together?

14:03.040 --> 14:05.566
- He does.
- Oh, sweet Lord.

14:05.610 --> 14:07.806
- Oh my god!

14:07.840 --> 14:10.172
I've been sitting here
wondering the whole time

14:10.210 --> 14:11.905
whether Aidan had
told you or not.

14:11.950 --> 14:13.213
- He hadn't.

14:14.250 --> 14:15.843
- Oh.

14:15.880 --> 14:18.212
- I've smelled
you before...

14:18.250 --> 14:19.320
on him.

14:19.350 --> 14:21.284
Ah, you wear

14:21.320 --> 14:23.152
a very distinct perfume.

14:23.190 --> 14:25.181
It's quite lovely.

14:25.230 --> 14:27.722
- You didn't tell her?
What about the rule?

14:27.760 --> 14:29.319
- Is she going to eat her? I
feel like she's gonna eat her.

14:29.360 --> 14:30.828
We should do something.
- Shhh!

14:30.870 --> 14:32.190
- I had no idea about you.

14:32.230 --> 14:34.289
- Oh, we, uh, weren't
together at the time.

14:34.340 --> 14:36.729
I had only just
returned to Boston.

14:36.770 --> 14:39.068
- OK, whoa.

14:39.110 --> 14:42.705
I would hate to be
that woman, an "overlapper".

14:42.740 --> 14:45.277
I mean, this conversation
would be a lot different

14:45.310 --> 14:47.278
if we had overlapped.

14:47.320 --> 14:50.688
- Yes, it would.

14:51.750 --> 14:52.956
(Sighing)

14:54.220 --> 14:55.710
- Who wants more coffee?

14:55.760 --> 14:57.057
- I would love some.

14:57.090 --> 14:58.251
- OK, here you go.

14:58.290 --> 15:00.019
Uh-oh! "Spilly™!
Just a little bit.

15:00.060 --> 15:02.199
It's an old tablecloth.
That's fine.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.262
(Grunts)

15:19.950 --> 15:21.816
(Screams)

15:24.350 --> 15:25.249
- I got hungry,

15:25.290 --> 15:29.056
and I knew how much
you wanted to taste her.

15:29.090 --> 15:30.182
(Whimpers)

15:30.230 --> 15:31.288
Share her with me.

15:31.330 --> 15:34.652
(Whimpering)

15:34.700 --> 15:36.190
(Screaming)

15:38.230 --> 15:40.130
(Breathing unevenly)

15:41.740 --> 15:43.333
(Sighing)

15:44.340 --> 15:46.832
- What are you doing?

15:46.870 --> 15:48.429
(Crickets chirping)

15:48.480 --> 15:51.780
- We keep talking about
how much everything's changed

15:51.810 --> 15:52.777
in 80 years,

15:52.810 --> 15:57.179
Boston, you.

15:57.220 --> 16:01.316
But I don't know if I've
changed enough for all of this.

16:01.360 --> 16:05.126
Your life, where do
I fitin it?

16:05.160 --> 16:07.254
- Come here.

16:11.470 --> 16:16.965
You were amazing tonight
and you fit perfectly.

16:24.350 --> 16:28.719
- So, are we gonna
talk about last night?

16:28.750 --> 16:30.684
- The chicken
was delicious!

16:30.720 --> 16:31.744
- Uh-huh.

16:31.790 --> 16:34.350
- You really sealed
the crap out of those juices.

16:34.390 --> 16:36.119
- I do my best.

16:36.160 --> 16:37.958
- It was fine.

16:37.990 --> 16:42.791
- So if I was going to
ask you to come over again...

16:44.200 --> 16:47.830
- I would think about it.

16:48.870 --> 16:51.339
** Meet me in the atmosphere

16:52.370 --> 16:55.101
- I'll take that.

16:55.140 --> 16:59.077
* Don't worry
I'll take you there

17:01.780 --> 17:05.215
* I'm lost and
what is home?

17:05.250 --> 17:07.457
* It's not a place
I need

17:07.490 --> 17:10.016
* Or a place I know

17:10.060 --> 17:12.028
Oh my god.

17:13.530 --> 17:17.397
* Ooh *

17:21.069 --> 17:23.038
- Hi, Julia.

17:23.069 --> 17:24.935
- Hey.

17:26.140 --> 17:27.278
Uh, I gotta go.

17:27.310 --> 17:29.404
I'm late for rounds.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.070
(Bird chirping, car honking)

17:36.120 --> 17:37.144
(Sighing)

17:37.190 --> 17:38.146
- That was brutal.

17:38.190 --> 17:39.680
- What are you doing here?

17:39.720 --> 17:42.155
- I'm--I'm trying
to fix things.

17:42.190 --> 17:43.328
- You're too late.

17:43.360 --> 17:45.249
You could've come back

17:45.290 --> 17:48.328
when I was angry, you could've
come back when I was confused.

17:48.360 --> 17:51.295
It would've been great
if you'd popped back up

17:51.330 --> 17:53.731
when I was still worried to
death about you, but now--

17:53.770 --> 17:55.989
- Now there's Julia.

17:56.840 --> 17:58.205
That was fast.

17:59.710 --> 18:03.169
- A lot of things have been
happening very suddenly lately.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.604
Where is Brynn?

18:06.650 --> 18:08.311
(Sighing)

18:08.350 --> 18:11.320
I don't wanna know
the answer to that.

18:11.350 --> 18:13.079
- I'm sorry, Josh.

18:14.290 --> 18:16.816
I was confused when I left,

18:16.860 --> 18:20.455
after everything
that I'd seen and done.

18:21.630 --> 18:23.291
It was a mistake,

18:23.330 --> 18:25.992
one of many that
I wanna make up for...

18:27.500 --> 18:29.059
starting with you.

18:32.870 --> 18:34.736
- Well, like I said,
you're too late.

18:38.480 --> 18:40.209
(Sighing)

18:42.680 --> 18:44.648
- She wants you back.

18:44.690 --> 18:47.045
- I told her
I'm with you.

18:47.090 --> 18:48.819
- I don't know if
you should've done that.

18:48.860 --> 18:50.259
- What? Why?

18:50.290 --> 18:52.759
- We can't keep
pretending to move slowly

18:52.790 --> 18:54.326
like we just met.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.319
We were engaged, OK?

18:58.370 --> 19:01.192
You don't wade
back in after that.

19:01.240 --> 19:02.639
You dive.

19:04.270 --> 19:06.762
If you're gonna leave me,
I want you to do it now...

19:06.810 --> 19:07.572
- No.

19:07.610 --> 19:10.307
- ...before I get in
this any deeper.

19:12.250 --> 19:13.843
I don't wanna get
crushed again.

19:13.880 --> 19:15.211
- I'm not gonna do that.

19:15.250 --> 19:16.376
- I'm not
saying this

19:16.420 --> 19:18.115
to get promises
from you.

19:19.420 --> 19:22.151
I want you to think
about this conversation...

19:23.490 --> 19:25.549
and whatever
Nora said too.

19:31.900 --> 19:34.198
- (Woman on PA):
Chantal Preston,

19:34.240 --> 19:35.196
extension 1145.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.129
- Nora?

19:38.440 --> 19:40.602
What are you doing here?

19:40.640 --> 19:42.529
(Telephone ringing)

19:42.580 --> 19:46.301
- Trying unsuccessfully
to get my job back.

19:46.350 --> 19:49.240
- Hmm...
Have you seen Josh?

19:49.280 --> 19:51.817
- Yeah, and Julia.

19:51.850 --> 19:53.511
- Oh.

19:53.560 --> 19:54.914
- Mm-hmm.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.917
So how are you doing?

19:56.960 --> 19:58.553
- You really
wanna know?

20:00.830 --> 20:04.198
I've wrecked so
many lives, Nora,

20:04.230 --> 20:06.221
starting with Janet.

20:07.600 --> 20:12.561
But I think that she could be
the thing that I set straight,

20:12.610 --> 20:16.399
if I could just make
contact with her.

20:16.440 --> 20:18.841
- How do you know you can
get through to her?

20:18.880 --> 20:19.904
- I don't.

20:19.950 --> 20:23.250
But I can't
just not try.

20:24.990 --> 20:26.389
- Let me help you.

20:28.790 --> 20:30.622
- Seriously?

20:30.660 --> 20:32.651
- I still have a few
friends in here,

20:32.690 --> 20:34.624
friends who
owe me favours.

20:36.360 --> 20:39.227
- When I brought my daughter
out of the ground,

20:39.270 --> 20:41.739
and handed her the task
of cleaning up Boston,

20:41.770 --> 20:44.432
many of you
expected her to fail,

20:44.470 --> 20:46.199
as did I.

20:46.240 --> 20:48.470
But in less than a year,

20:48.510 --> 20:51.480
she has shaped chaos into order.

20:55.320 --> 20:58.540
Suren, the reward
for hard work

20:58.590 --> 21:00.888
is usually
more hard work,

21:00.920 --> 21:02.979
and that is to be
the case with you.

21:03.020 --> 21:07.321
You will continue to govern
this city for the council.

21:07.360 --> 21:10.398
- So I will be staying here.

21:10.430 --> 21:12.319
For how long?

21:12.370 --> 21:13.690
- Until I deem otherwise.

21:13.740 --> 21:15.469
- So there is to
be no advancement.

21:15.500 --> 21:18.606
- There may be in time.

21:18.640 --> 21:21.473
- Mother, why are
you doing this?

21:21.510 --> 21:23.478
Are you unhappy
with me?

21:23.510 --> 21:25.945
- I am quite satisfied.

21:25.980 --> 21:29.518
But a few months of
"quite satisfied" don't make up

21:29.550 --> 21:32.417
for 8 centuries of
"utterly disappointed".

21:34.720 --> 21:37.018
And Aidan,

21:37.060 --> 21:39.882
you were to help
Suren with Boston

21:39.930 --> 21:42.399
and I would grant you
freedom from our world.

21:42.430 --> 21:44.797
I believe you've
kept up your end.

21:44.830 --> 21:49.267
So now, I'm going to
grant you freedom...

21:49.300 --> 21:51.906
in the truest
sense of the word.

21:51.940 --> 21:57.276
You can enjoy your mortals and
all their society holds for you,

21:57.310 --> 22:00.439
- because this world
is now sealed off to you...

22:01.650 --> 22:04.745
all places and all people.

22:04.790 --> 22:07.009
- Mother,
you can't mean this.

22:07.050 --> 22:10.930
- No one in our world is to have
anything to do with Aidan White.

22:10.960 --> 22:13.349
Any vampire found
in contact with this man

22:13.400 --> 22:14.890
will be put to death.

22:21.540 --> 22:23.429
(Growling)

22:23.470 --> 22:24.960
(Groaning)

22:25.010 --> 22:26.762
- How can you
do this to me,

22:26.810 --> 22:29.370
after everything that
I've done for this family,

22:29.410 --> 22:31.606
after everything that
I've sacrificed for her?

22:31.650 --> 22:34.369
- Come now,
every move you've made,

22:34.420 --> 22:36.377
you've made for
your own benefit.

22:36.420 --> 22:37.888
(Growling)

22:37.920 --> 22:39.012
And now, you can leave.

22:39.050 --> 22:40.814
(Grunts)

22:40.860 --> 22:42.385
(Laughing)

22:42.420 --> 22:43.888
- Yeah, and you
can go to hell.

22:46.430 --> 22:48.728
- You dare to speak
this way to me?

22:48.760 --> 22:50.865
- This is what
freedom sounds like.

22:50.900 --> 22:52.425
(Groaning)

22:52.470 --> 22:55.861
- I should turn you
to dust right here.

22:55.900 --> 22:58.961
(Choking)

22:59.010 --> 23:03.379
But we know how fragile
this one can be.

23:03.410 --> 23:04.775
(Gasping)

23:04.810 --> 23:08.110
So enjoy the mercy
I'm showing you now.

23:08.150 --> 23:09.675
(Gasping)

23:13.560 --> 23:14.755
(Panting)

23:18.560 --> 23:19.823
(Sobs)

23:22.530 --> 23:24.396
(Birds chirping
and bell tolling)

23:24.430 --> 23:26.797
- Then right when
I think my mind is made up,

23:26.830 --> 23:28.764
Julia tells me
to unmake it.

23:28.800 --> 23:31.735
- Didn't you tell me
yourself earlier

23:31.770 --> 23:33.704
that Julia's the reason
we got into this thing?

23:33.740 --> 23:35.071
- Yeah, yeah.

23:35.110 --> 23:40.514
But what Nora and I
have is bigger.

23:40.550 --> 23:41.813
It's biological.

23:41.850 --> 23:43.545
- Or maybe
it's guilt.

23:43.590 --> 23:46.343
You might've made her
into what you are,

23:46.390 --> 23:49.189
but she's let herself
become what she is now.

23:52.030 --> 23:53.953
- You all right?

23:54.000 --> 23:57.823
What's up? You just
seem extra broody today.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.395
- I'm free.

23:59.430 --> 24:00.761
- What?

24:00.800 --> 24:03.337
You're f-f-free from...

24:04.070 --> 24:05.731
- Everything,
all of it.

24:05.770 --> 24:07.431
(Sighing)

24:07.480 --> 24:10.177
- Then isn't
this great news?

24:10.210 --> 24:12.941
I mean, shouldn't you be,
like, in a field somewhere,

24:12.980 --> 24:15.620
wearing white linen,
rolling around in daisies?

24:15.650 --> 24:18.984
- It's not freedom, Josh.
It's banishment.

24:19.020 --> 24:22.479
I am banished from all
vampires under penalty of death.

24:22.520 --> 24:24.352
So no blood dens.

24:24.390 --> 24:26.222
No food. What am
I gonna eat?

24:26.260 --> 24:29.719
No clean-up crew. What the hell
am I gonna do when I slip up?

24:29.760 --> 24:31.660
- Don't.
Don't slip up.

24:31.700 --> 24:34.590
- That's not all.
I--I can't see Suren.

24:38.470 --> 24:41.132
- Listen, I've seen
you bottom out.

24:42.510 --> 24:43.773
That guy you drank from

24:43.810 --> 24:45.744
right before you went
into violent convulsions,

24:45.780 --> 24:46.975
that was me.

24:47.010 --> 24:49.672
So if you really
wanna go clean,

24:49.720 --> 24:52.610
don't you think it's best
if you eliminate the people

24:52.650 --> 24:54.550
that you got dirty with?

24:54.590 --> 24:57.355
- Suren isn't just
some drug buddy, Josh.

24:57.390 --> 24:59.427
Freedom without her
means nothing.

24:59.460 --> 25:00.427
Uh...

25:00.460 --> 25:01.427
(Sighing)

25:01.460 --> 25:03.690
I love her.

25:08.570 --> 25:11.005
(Sighing)

25:11.040 --> 25:13.168
- So what are
you gonna do?

25:13.210 --> 25:15.235
(Siren wailing
in distance)

25:27.120 --> 25:28.986
- Those are beautiful.

25:29.820 --> 25:31.322
- I know you, don't I?

25:31.360 --> 25:33.385
- Yeah, I used to work here.

25:33.430 --> 25:35.023
I know Tim Forest.

25:35.060 --> 25:36.459
- Oh.

25:36.500 --> 25:37.729
(Patient coughing)

25:39.730 --> 25:42.791
- But there's someone
else we have in common.

25:42.840 --> 25:44.399
- Who?

25:44.440 --> 25:45.737
- Her name's Sally.

25:47.510 --> 25:50.104
- The memories
in these drawings...

25:51.110 --> 25:52.669
they're hers.

25:54.220 --> 25:55.449
- I've been here before.

25:57.120 --> 25:59.088
This house...

25:59.120 --> 26:00.713
I see it in my dreams.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.580
Sally?

26:02.620 --> 26:04.349
- You're not sick, Janet.

26:06.630 --> 26:09.099
Sally is a ghost.

26:09.130 --> 26:11.462
And the reason that
you have her memories

26:11.500 --> 26:13.423
is because
she possessed you.

26:16.640 --> 26:19.166
(Siren wailing)

26:19.210 --> 26:21.133
(Honking)

26:21.180 --> 26:22.579
(Car alarm wailing)

26:23.580 --> 26:25.309
- Hey.

26:27.310 --> 26:30.348
- You got a lot of nerve
setting up this meeting.

26:30.380 --> 26:31.541
I could be killed.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.479
- I wouldn't ask if
it wasn't important.

26:33.520 --> 26:36.080
Anyone follow you?
- Does it matter?

26:36.120 --> 26:37.679
My life is forfeit
with you cast out.

26:37.730 --> 26:40.483
- Uh-uh. No, you've
paid your debt to Mother,

26:40.530 --> 26:41.600
you're safe for now.

26:41.630 --> 26:43.291
But, Henry,
let me ask you...

26:44.600 --> 26:46.398
do you think I'm a fool?

26:46.430 --> 26:47.591
- What?

26:47.640 --> 26:49.529
- I wanna trust you.

26:49.570 --> 26:51.732
Hell, I need to trust you.

26:51.770 --> 26:53.602
Every chance that
I've given you,

26:53.640 --> 26:56.610
you've turned into a grenade
and you've lobbed it back at me.

26:56.640 --> 26:57.869
- That's not
me anymore.

26:57.910 --> 27:02.245
Aidan, I swear
you can trust me.

27:02.280 --> 27:03.816
(Sighing)

27:03.850 --> 27:04.817
- OK.

27:04.850 --> 27:06.739
All right.

27:06.790 --> 27:09.157
I need a favour.

27:11.260 --> 27:13.695
- That was the
first car I owned.

27:13.730 --> 27:15.494
- That was
Sally's car.

27:15.530 --> 27:17.760
- You know all this
because Sally's telling you?

27:20.170 --> 27:22.229
- This is futile,
you know.

27:22.270 --> 27:24.705
You can help every
living soul on Earth,

27:24.740 --> 27:26.765
but you'll never
get rid of me.

27:26.810 --> 27:29.780
- Just please
tell her I'm sorry.

27:29.810 --> 27:31.608
- Sally is a good person.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.778
- So she ruined me?

27:33.820 --> 27:35.470
- She was weak.

27:37.350 --> 27:39.785
She never thought
of the consequences.

27:39.820 --> 27:43.518
She would do anything
to take it back.

27:46.930 --> 27:50.150
- Wait. You're a
patient here too.

27:50.200 --> 27:51.861
- What?

27:51.900 --> 27:54.767
- A schizophrenic
or a compulsive liar.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.495
You heard me babbling
to the doctors

27:56.540 --> 27:58.429
and made up your
own version in your head.

27:58.470 --> 28:00.404
- No. Sally, I need
a little help here.

28:00.440 --> 28:01.737
- What do you want me to do?

28:01.780 --> 28:03.009
- Please stop
talking like that!

28:03.040 --> 28:05.475
- I don't know,
something "ghosty".

28:05.510 --> 28:07.376
- Do I look like
Patrick Swayze to you?

28:07.410 --> 28:10.914
- What can I do
to make you believe me?

28:12.920 --> 28:15.958
- "The trees blow
in the breeze.

28:15.990 --> 28:18.755
"The bees buzz
by my knees."

28:18.790 --> 28:19.860
- No way.

28:19.890 --> 28:21.358
- What is that?

28:21.400 --> 28:23.721
- (Both):
It's a poem.

28:23.770 --> 28:25.420
- I want you
to finish it.

28:25.470 --> 28:27.598
- OK. Sally?

28:27.630 --> 28:30.691
- I wrote that when
I was 9. I don't--

28:30.740 --> 28:32.401
I don't know if I can remember.

28:32.440 --> 28:35.478
The trees blow in the breeze,
the bees buzz by my knees.

28:35.510 --> 28:38.775
- Sally, you tried.
She doesn't want help.

28:38.810 --> 28:40.642
Let's just go home.

28:44.820 --> 28:46.515
Please.

28:46.550 --> 28:47.711
- Please, please.

28:47.760 --> 28:49.580
"1 look at the clouds...”

28:49.620 --> 28:51.759
- "T look at the clouds."

28:51.790 --> 28:54.259
- "I wait for the sun..."

28:54.300 --> 28:55.756
- "I wait for the sun..."

28:55.800 --> 28:58.497
- "And yell;
'Please, please, please!™

28:58.530 --> 29:01.989
- "And yell;
'Please, please, please!™

29:02.040 --> 29:03.394
Is that it?

29:04.410 --> 29:06.265
(Sobs)

29:06.310 --> 29:08.404
It's OK, Janet.

29:10.410 --> 29:12.003
We're gonna get
you out of here.

29:12.050 --> 29:13.870
- OK.

29:16.520 --> 29:18.386
- This means nothing.

29:19.390 --> 29:21.449
This means everything.

29:21.490 --> 29:24.255
I know that the good in me
is stronger than you.

29:24.290 --> 29:26.622
I'm stronger than you.

29:26.660 --> 29:27.798
- Sally?

29:27.830 --> 29:29.229
- Go.

29:30.760 --> 29:32.319
- Who were you
talking to?

29:32.370 --> 29:34.361
- Nothing.

29:35.670 --> 29:37.399
I'm talking to nothing.

29:37.440 --> 29:40.364
You think Janet's
gonna be OK?

29:40.410 --> 29:42.037
- I think so.

29:42.080 --> 29:45.380
You know what else I think?
I think you are a horrible poet.

29:45.410 --> 29:48.118
- =You couldn't
listen to me, could you?

29:48.150 --> 29:49.709
You need weight off
your conscience,

29:49.750 --> 29:50.888
so when I won't help,

29:50.920 --> 29:52.740
you have to find somebody
who's equally as damaged.

29:52.790 --> 29:54.554
- Leave her alone, Josh.

29:54.590 --> 29:55.887
- You are amazing.

29:55.920 --> 29:58.184
I can't believe
that I was trying

29:58.230 --> 29:59.755
to convince myself
that you'd really changed.

29:59.790 --> 30:01.394
- I'm trying to.

30:01.430 --> 30:04.889
- Yeah. Well, thanks for
the moment of clarity.

30:06.070 --> 30:08.266
Stay away from me.

30:09.570 --> 30:11.732
(Woman on PA, indistinct)

30:17.540 --> 30:19.372
- Hello. Oh!

30:19.410 --> 30:22.914
I was worried Henry was setting
a trap, but I had to risk it.

30:22.950 --> 30:24.543
- It's OK. He can
be trusted now.

30:24.590 --> 30:25.819
It's OK.

30:25.850 --> 30:28.512
- I thought I'd never
get to say goodbye.

30:28.560 --> 30:29.959
- Now you don't have to.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.787
Come away with me.

30:33.830 --> 30:37.357
You said you wanted to
see the world. Now we can.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.095
- It's--it's
not that easy.

30:39.130 --> 30:41.462
This isn't the future
I'm supposed to have.

30:41.500 --> 30:44.333
- If you think that Mother
is ever gonna let you lead,

30:44.370 --> 30:45.599
you're lying
to yourself.

30:47.140 --> 30:50.576
Suren, no one knows the future
that they're supposed to have.

30:50.610 --> 30:53.773
Maybe Mother's cruelty
is a blessing in disguise.

30:53.810 --> 30:57.348
I wanted my freedom. You wanted
to move on from Boston.

30:57.380 --> 31:00.816
She's made me realize
that we can have it all.

31:03.690 --> 31:05.954
We can create
a new life together.

31:11.430 --> 31:13.694
- How far
and how fast?

31:20.110 --> 31:22.533
- Thank you so much.

31:22.580 --> 31:24.742
- I'm so proud
of you, Janet.

31:24.780 --> 31:26.407
- I'm just glad
it's over.

31:26.450 --> 31:29.374
- Hopefully it's the
last time we'll see you here.

31:29.420 --> 31:31.912
You're in good hands.
All right.

31:33.020 --> 31:34.749
(Door closing)

31:34.790 --> 31:36.451
- Sally?

31:36.490 --> 31:37.719
You here?

31:39.190 --> 31:40.487
Hey.

31:40.930 --> 31:42.989
Janet's home.

31:43.030 --> 31:44.998
She was released.

31:45.030 --> 31:46.794
- That's good.

31:46.830 --> 31:48.594
- That's it?

31:48.640 --> 31:51.769
You save a woman from insanity
and you say that's good?

31:53.270 --> 31:54.908
I know. I yelled.

31:54.940 --> 31:57.534
I was just worried you
were doing the wrong thing

31:57.580 --> 32:00.072
and I've been just
so worried about you lately.

32:00.110 --> 32:02.613
Then Nora's back
and the choices she's making...

32:02.650 --> 32:04.539
- Aidan's leaving.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.718
- What?
He's not leaving.

32:07.750 --> 32:09.081
He's leaving?
Where is he going?

32:09.120 --> 32:11.054
- I don't know yet.

32:11.090 --> 32:12.854
Couldn't tell you anyway.

32:13.930 --> 32:16.524
- I thought when
you said "banished",

32:16.560 --> 32:18.619
you didn't mean
entirely from Boston.

32:18.670 --> 32:20.069
- This is
my choice.

32:20.100 --> 32:21.898
I'm gonna enjoy my freedom,

32:21.940 --> 32:24.102
and Suren's gonna
enjoy it with me.

32:24.140 --> 32:27.838
<i>*Xk</i>

32:27.870 --> 32:29.508
(Sighing)

32:29.540 --> 32:30.974
- You can't go!

32:31.850 --> 32:33.648
What about all this?

32:33.680 --> 32:34.943
Fitting in with people?

32:34.980 --> 32:37.915
Where does being a vampire
fugitive fit in with that?

32:37.950 --> 32:39.588
- Josh.

32:39.620 --> 32:41.588
I am a vampire.

32:42.590 --> 32:45.457
And the reason
we got into this

32:45.490 --> 32:47.527
was to be happy.

32:47.560 --> 32:50.951
And I think that...

32:51.000 --> 32:54.334
that I can be happy
with Suren.

32:54.370 --> 32:56.236
- Aidan, we need you.

32:57.270 --> 33:00.069
We're strongest
together, aren't we?

33:00.110 --> 33:02.807
- Yeah, I'm not
so sure about that.

33:02.840 --> 33:05.969
Listen, you two,

33:06.010 --> 33:07.978
you're gonna be
strong without me.

33:08.020 --> 33:10.079
I know you can.

33:10.120 --> 33:12.748
* Something beautiful...

33:14.260 --> 33:17.116
- How do we get
in touch with you?

33:17.160 --> 33:18.685
- You can't.

33:18.730 --> 33:21.654
- How do you get
in touch with us?

33:21.700 --> 33:23.828
- I can't.

33:23.860 --> 33:25.191
- I mean, not even a letter?

33:25.230 --> 33:26.823
- Mother would use it
to find us.

33:26.870 --> 33:28.998
- You can't hack
somebody's email?

33:29.040 --> 33:32.260
- I'm sorry, guys.
This is it.

33:32.310 --> 33:35.769
I can't just run.
I have to disappear.

33:35.810 --> 33:38.142
* ..out of the city...

33:39.550 --> 33:41.848
- I like the
stolen email idea.

33:43.550 --> 33:46.542
- I'll try to reach out
when I'm safe.

33:46.590 --> 33:48.115
- Good.

33:48.160 --> 33:50.015
- I gotta go now.

33:55.630 --> 33:59.294
* It's only time

33:59.330 --> 34:02.868
* Going by

34:04.040 --> 34:07.670
* It's only time

34:10.739 --> 34:14.677
* Something beautiful

34:14.719 --> 34:16.779
- I'll always
be here for you.

34:16.820 --> 34:19.187
Know that.

34:19.219 --> 34:22.588
* Something beautiful

34:23.960 --> 34:26.121
- Actually, he won't.

34:27.590 --> 34:29.058
But I will.

34:29.100 --> 34:30.329
* Something beautiful

34:30.360 --> 34:33.864
Look me up in
a couple hundred years.

34:34.900 --> 34:37.733
* Something beautiful

34:39.870 --> 34:43.931
(* Woman vocalizing )

35:01.630 --> 35:03.689
- I love you both.

35:11.140 --> 35:13.962
* It's only time

35:14.010 --> 35:15.978
- Just like that?

35:16.010 --> 35:18.104
* Going by

35:18.150 --> 35:19.743
- Just like that.

35:19.780 --> 35:22.750
* It's only time

35:22.780 --> 35:24.043
(Gull squawking)

35:24.080 --> 35:26.082
(Cars honking)

35:26.120 --> 35:29.988
*Ain'tit
something beautiful? *

35:30.020 --> 35:32.125
(Sniffling)

35:32.160 --> 35:34.083
(Crickets chirping)

35:34.130 --> 35:35.598
- Hey.

35:35.630 --> 35:38.167
I know you're mad.

35:38.200 --> 35:40.726
But I have
to talk to you.

35:40.770 --> 35:43.091
- OK, but I owe you
an apology first.

35:43.140 --> 35:45.108
You two were right...

35:46.940 --> 35:48.237
helping Janet.

35:48.280 --> 35:49.736
- Don't apologize.

35:49.780 --> 35:51.305
I'm a mess.

35:51.350 --> 35:54.172
I went off to explore

35:54.220 --> 35:57.246
my new instincts
and impulses.

35:57.280 --> 36:00.011
- What happened out there?

36:00.050 --> 36:01.711
- Brynn.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.717
(Dog barking in distance)

36:03.760 --> 36:07.981
I always thought that she was
the one that kept Connor at bay.

36:08.030 --> 36:10.021
Now I know it
was the opposite.

36:11.830 --> 36:16.063
That girl has got
an appetite for violence,

36:16.100 --> 36:20.105
the purest, swiftest...

36:20.140 --> 36:23.201
angriest violence
I've ever seen.

36:24.210 --> 36:26.975
- And what about
your appetite?

36:27.010 --> 36:28.876
- I got full.

36:32.090 --> 36:34.047
That's why I wanted
to help Sally.

36:34.090 --> 36:35.751
(Scoffing)

36:35.790 --> 36:37.519
- I didn't think
you'd come back.

36:37.560 --> 36:39.426
The way we
left things--

36:40.360 --> 36:41.998
<i>- I know.</i>

36:42.030 --> 36:43.919
I know.

36:43.960 --> 36:45.724
And now you're
happy with Julia.

36:47.370 --> 36:49.532
And you deserve
to be, Josh.

36:51.440 --> 36:53.499
I just want what's
best for you.

36:54.610 --> 36:57.580
I hope you can believe
that when I tell you this:

36:57.610 --> 37:00.978
There's other things
I learned out there with Brynn.

37:01.010 --> 37:05.220
I learned how you can get back
everything you ever wanted

37:05.250 --> 37:07.981
and never have to worry about
hurting anyone ever again.

37:08.020 --> 37:10.079
- You're not
making any sense.

37:10.120 --> 37:12.760
- I know how to lift
this curse, Josh...

37:13.760 --> 37:15.524
Forever.

37:20.630 --> 37:21.597
- It's about finding

37:21.640 --> 37:22.766
the man who turned you.

37:22.800 --> 37:25.337
- I'm the one who turned you.

37:25.370 --> 37:27.862
I'm the one who
gave you this gift.

37:27.910 --> 37:31.642
- If you find him
and you kill him...

37:32.710 --> 37:33.848
you're free.

37:33.880 --> 37:35.370
- No!

37:35.420 --> 37:36.910
It can't be that easy!

37:36.950 --> 37:38.486
I--I-- Who told you this?

37:38.520 --> 37:39.885
- It's true, Josh.

37:39.920 --> 37:42.059
- So, in order to
cure myself permanently,

37:42.090 --> 37:43.785
I have to kill Ray? No!

37:43.820 --> 37:46.482
- You need to take words
like "cure" and "condition"

37:46.530 --> 37:47.929
and throw them
out the window!

37:47.960 --> 37:50.349
This situation is
not medical, Josh.

37:50.400 --> 37:51.993
It's supernatural!

37:52.030 --> 37:54.499
It's a good,
old-fashioned curse!

37:54.540 --> 37:55.666
- Brynn told you this.

37:55.700 --> 37:56.861
- Yes!
- Yeah?

37:56.900 --> 37:57.867
- Purebreads know.

37:57.900 --> 37:59.937
She told me
the specifics.

37:59.970 --> 38:01.699
If you want to
lift this curse,

38:01.740 --> 38:04.038
you have to kill Ray
while he's still a man.

38:04.080 --> 38:06.606
- I have to kill Ray!
- Before the change.

38:06.650 --> 38:09.642
Which means you have
to do it before you change.

38:09.680 --> 38:11.079
You can save
yourself, Josh.

38:11.120 --> 38:13.885
You can kill the son of
a bitch who did this to you

38:13.920 --> 38:15.115
and get your life back.

38:15.160 --> 38:17.458
- I can't!

38:17.490 --> 38:19.379
Killing him won't
make me normal.

38:19.430 --> 38:20.784
It'll make me a murderer.

38:20.830 --> 38:24.596
I'll still be every bit
the monster I still am now.

38:28.600 --> 38:30.739
- Why are you smiling?

38:30.770 --> 38:33.740
- Because I knew that
would be your answer.

38:37.110 --> 38:39.408
(Sighing)

38:39.450 --> 38:40.804
- Wait!

38:43.920 --> 38:47.879
OK, let's just say
this is all true.

38:51.660 --> 38:54.652
Why haven't you killed me
to cure yourself?

38:56.530 --> 38:58.919
I can see how much
pain you're in.

38:58.970 --> 39:01.837
- I'm not in pain
because of what I am.

39:03.740 --> 39:07.040
I'm in pain because
of what I've done.

39:09.880 --> 39:12.872
And I could never
kill you, Josh.

39:16.580 --> 39:18.389
I love you too much.

39:30.860 --> 39:32.464
- This is not what I expected.

39:32.500 --> 39:33.490
- It's temporary.

39:33.530 --> 39:34.998
We have to bury ourselves,

39:35.040 --> 39:38.670
and that means staying
in places like this, using cash.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.747
Suren, are you all right?

39:44.780 --> 39:46.805
- I'm hungry.

39:48.150 --> 39:49.914
(Sighing)

39:49.950 --> 39:52.089
- Yeah, me too.

39:53.220 --> 39:55.780
There's a small hospital
one town over.

39:55.820 --> 39:57.914
We can go there in
the morning to get food.

39:57.960 --> 40:00.827
- I don't think
that will do.

40:00.860 --> 40:02.225
- I know you don't
want bagged blood,

40:02.260 --> 40:04.194
but we can't leave
a trail of bodies behind--

40:04.230 --> 40:06.119
- You don't understand!
I'm hungry now.

40:08.170 --> 40:09.899
Feed with me!

40:12.010 --> 40:15.036
I think I overestimated
my resolve.

40:16.880 --> 40:19.770
- OK, I'll get
you some food.

40:20.850 --> 40:22.272
Just, um, wait here.

40:22.320 --> 40:23.879
I'll be right back.

40:23.920 --> 40:25.547
- Hurry.

40:27.820 --> 40:30.050
(Thunder rumbling)

40:30.090 --> 40:31.956
(Sighing)

40:48.810 --> 40:50.778
** Tt's how we know

40:50.810 --> 40:54.872
* He rolled up his sleeves
to his elbows

40:56.980 --> 40:58.948
* When the boxes were filled

41:01.860 --> 41:04.921
* And ever still a part of me

41:04.960 --> 41:08.055
* For anyone
I still believe

41:09.060 --> 41:12.269
* While I was self-propelled

41:12.300 --> 41:14.894
* It's none of
your concern anymore

41:14.940 --> 41:19.104
* 'Cause I know some people

41:19.140 --> 41:21.199
* That could carry us around

41:21.240 --> 41:24.744
- I told my mom
and she was like:

41:24.780 --> 41:26.703
"I'm sure it was
just the wind."

41:26.750 --> 41:28.172
But I wasn't imagining it.

41:28.210 --> 41:30.816
There was definitely
something up there.

41:32.050 --> 41:33.711
What was that?

41:33.750 --> 41:35.616
And we heard these footsteps.

41:35.660 --> 41:37.355
(Loud thudding)

41:37.390 --> 41:39.119
It was very loud, very heavy.

41:39.160 --> 41:41.128
- My daughter hears it,
I hear it.

41:41.160 --> 41:43.094
We're startled, we're scared...

41:43.130 --> 41:45.326
(Mother talking, indistinct)

41:45.370 --> 41:46.360
- What was that?

41:50.240 --> 41:52.766
* It's how you were raised

41:52.810 --> 41:54.130
* Ah

41:54.170 --> 41:57.902
* You can't speak
to insult your age

41:57.940 --> 42:00.944
* On the face of the Earth

42:00.980 --> 42:03.278
* Ah

42:03.320 --> 42:06.187
* And we can take it now

42:06.220 --> 42:11.056
* Because I know
some people...

42:11.090 --> 42:14.128
- You thought we'd just
let you run?

42:14.160 --> 42:16.652
Come now, Aidan.

42:16.700 --> 42:18.691
Surely you know me
better than that.

42:21.700 --> 42:24.670
<i>* Ba ba ba ba ba ha...</i>

42:42.290 --> 42:45.851

42:45.890 --> 42:49.326

42:49.360 --> 42:51.761
* And you can show us how

42:51.800 --> 42:54.121
* Oh, because I know

42:54.170 --> 42:56.366
* Some people

42:56.400 --> 42:59.233
