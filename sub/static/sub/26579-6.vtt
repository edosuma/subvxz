cigar in the other,
and I said to the chief --

00:29.290 --> 00:31.210
I said,
"You pin that medal

00:31.210 --> 00:33.620
right in the middle."

00:33.620 --> 00:35.460
Right?

00:35.460 --> 00:37.250
Hey, hey, look at that!

00:37.250 --> 00:39.620
Officer John Nolan.

00:39.620 --> 00:41.790
Oh! Grittiest recruit I've ever
trained right here, man.

00:41.790 --> 00:43.250
Good to see you.
You too, man.

00:43.250 --> 00:45.880
Only long-timers allowed
in here, Hawke.

00:45.880 --> 00:48.380
You know the rules.
I never met a rule

00:48.380 --> 00:50.460
so go get your old ass
over to the bar

00:50.460 --> 00:52.670
and get a drink. Come on.
It's on the Hawke.

00:52.670 --> 00:54.620
Whoo, sit down, man.

00:54.620 --> 00:56.290
Fun place you got here.

00:56.290 --> 00:59.170
It's a dump, but my credit
is so good.

if I got this in me."

01:04.710 --> 01:06.620
Long time ago, man.

01:06.620 --> 01:08.540
Mm.

01:08.540 --> 01:11.540
I tell you, my talents are
being wasted at the Academy.

01:11.540 --> 01:14.120
Seven years is too long
to keep The Hawke cooped up.

01:14.120 --> 01:15.290
Ah.
Yeah.
No, I need to get

How's the real thing

01:32.080 --> 01:34.250

You were right about the job.

01:34.250 --> 01:36.170
It is nothing
like the Academy.

01:36.170 --> 01:37.960

teach by the manual.

Never.

01:39.880 --> 01:42.620
Well, I wouldn't have been
ready if it wasn't for you.

me any support at the Academy.

generation of cops

blowing smoke.

01:52.620 --> 01:54.500
Good, because
I'm a terrible liar.
Yes, you are.

01:54.500 --> 01:55.750
You are terrible.

01:55.750 --> 01:57.790
Okay, mm.

01:57.790 --> 01:59.170
I got to wrap it up.
I got to get out of here.

01:59.170 --> 02:01.000
Mnh-mnh!
It's a school night,

02:01.000 --> 02:02.670

this job to do it hung over.

02:02.670 --> 02:04.250
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

02:04.250 --> 02:06.290
You can't tap out
on me tonight, no way.

02:06.290 --> 02:08.750
The night is too young,
and I am in no hurry

02:08.750 --> 02:10.380
to get back
to that motel -- none.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.380
A motel?

02:12.380 --> 02:14.830
Yeah. Well, my wife,
she, uh...

02:14.830 --> 02:17.040
Uh, she kicked me out
months ago.
No.

02:17.040 --> 02:18.460
Yeah. It's no big deal.

02:20.620 --> 02:22.750
It's no big deal.
Marriages are tough, right?

02:22.750 --> 02:24.960
You've been there.
Yes.

02:24.960 --> 02:27.040
I just...
I don't know.

02:27.040 --> 02:29.420
I just need to give her, uh --
give her a little space.

02:29.420 --> 02:30.380
That's all.

02:33.170 --> 02:34.580
You know, look,
I got a great couch.

02:34.580 --> 02:36.330
Why don't you crash
at my place tonight?

02:36.330 --> 02:40.670
No, no. I'm all paid
for the week at Travel Inn,

02:40.670 --> 02:43.170
and I have got
clean sheets.

02:43.170 --> 02:46.170
I got cold pizza, premium cable.

02:46.170 --> 02:48.790
Right? Hey, if that's not
living the dream, my friend...

02:48.790 --> 02:50.580
Yeah.
...then I don't know
what is, right?

Nolan: I've never seen him

03:03.580 --> 03:05.580

so self-assured,

03:05.580 --> 03:07.210
so --
Arrogant.

03:07.210 --> 03:09.170
You know he's living
in a motel now?

03:09.170 --> 03:11.540
That's what happens when you try
to be big policeman at home.

03:11.540 --> 03:13.880
You end up
on the couch.

03:13.880 --> 03:15.420
Tim rode with Hawke
back in the day.

03:15.420 --> 03:18.170
Damn straight.
Craziest six months of my life.

03:18.170 --> 03:20.290
Mm-hmm. Nolan hung out
with him last night.

03:20.290 --> 03:22.170
Hawke and Nolan?
Oh, yeah.

03:22.170 --> 03:23.540
They were tight
at the Academy.

03:23.540 --> 03:25.790
They bonded over their shared
love of old stuff.

03:25.790 --> 03:28.250
The Beastie Boys isn't old.
They formed before I was born.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.880
All right,
everyone take a seat.

03:30.880 --> 03:32.040
Got some
catching up to do.

03:33.790 --> 03:35.120
Let's go.

03:37.960 --> 03:41.290
First, let's congratulate
Officer Chen

03:41.290 --> 03:43.290
for allowing her T.O.
to finish his coffee

03:43.290 --> 03:45.670
before rolling
their vehicle.

03:50.290 --> 03:53.040
I see "training" is
working out for you.

03:53.040 --> 03:55.250
All right, more pressingly,

03:55.250 --> 03:57.920
midnight shift was flooded
with calls last night,

03:57.920 --> 03:59.750
and they left us
with their mess.

03:59.750 --> 04:01.750
Let's get started.

04:01.750 --> 04:05.580
Our detectives are working
a homicide in Larchmont Village,

04:05.580 --> 04:08.500
but there are witnesses that
still need to be interviewed.

04:08.500 --> 04:10.420
Bishop and Nolan,
you'll take that.

04:10.420 --> 04:13.380
And Burglary has got
a search warrant

04:13.380 --> 04:15.170
that patrol
didn't get around to.

04:15.170 --> 04:16.960
Bradford and Chen,
you'll take that.

04:16.960 --> 04:19.420
Come on, why can't Burglary
serve their own damn warrants?

04:19.420 --> 04:21.710
Because they don't have
the vim and vigor you have,

04:21.710 --> 04:23.710
Officer Bradford.

04:23.710 --> 04:25.960
This is yours.

04:25.960 --> 04:28.170
All the faces.
Don't worry.

04:28.170 --> 04:30.170
I have pending calls
for everybody!

04:30.170 --> 04:32.500
All right,
let's go knock 'em out

04:32.500 --> 04:34.790
and show the late shift
how real police work is done.

04:37.040 --> 04:39.000
Tim: All right, we're serving
a search warrant.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.420
You see door hinges?

04:40.420 --> 04:42.750
Uh, the door opens
outwards towards us.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.170
And what's
a "fatal funnel"?

04:44.170 --> 04:46.120
The first three feet
in any doorway.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.620
Not bad.
Here's the real test.

04:48.620 --> 04:51.080
Of all the things Burglary
told us about our suspect...

04:52.330 --> 04:54.380
...LeShawn Halvorsen,

04:54.380 --> 04:55.920
what's most important?

04:55.920 --> 04:57.750
Uh, history of
fighting with police.

04:57.750 --> 05:00.210
Wrong. This guy's been served
seven search warrants,

05:00.210 --> 05:02.000
spent half his life
on parole.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.670
Uh, I'm sorry.
I'm not sure I follow.

05:04.670 --> 05:07.620
He's been searched a lot.
He knows what doesn't work,

05:07.620 --> 05:09.580
so to find his stash, you'll
have to think like a crook.

05:09.580 --> 05:11.380
Can you do that?
Of course.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.880
You don't think I can?

05:15.880 --> 05:17.830
I think you were raised
to analyze bad guys,

05:17.830 --> 05:19.710
not be one,
and to be a great cop,

05:19.710 --> 05:21.420
you got to have
a little outlaw in you.

05:21.420 --> 05:22.670
Hinges?

05:22.670 --> 05:23.920
On the inside.

05:26.790 --> 05:28.790
Police.
Open up, LeShawn.

05:31.330 --> 05:33.460
What's an acceptable amount of
time to wait before we bust in?

05:38.040 --> 05:40.080
That had to hurt.

05:40.080 --> 05:41.580
Nolan: Why don't you
like Hawke?

05:41.580 --> 05:43.330
Talia: He's a throwback.
He thinks the good old days

05:43.330 --> 05:45.460
were when the LAPD
was 90% white men.

05:45.460 --> 05:47.500
Really? Didn't strike me
as that guy.

05:47.500 --> 05:49.040
I'm sure he didn't.

05:49.040 --> 05:52.420
Police Department!

05:52.420 --> 05:54.330
Hello?
You called last night.

05:54.330 --> 05:56.460
You said you had some
information about a homicide,

05:56.460 --> 05:58.290
a stabbing that happened
around the corner.
Oh, yeah.

05:58.290 --> 06:02.290
Uh, I was waiting so long,
I fell asleep on the couch.

06:02.290 --> 06:04.500
Can you tell us
what you witnessed?

06:04.500 --> 06:06.040
I'll do better than that.
I'll show you.

06:08.420 --> 06:09.710
Come on!

06:12.830 --> 06:14.750
Yo, lady cop,

06:14.750 --> 06:16.380
you can search
my place all day.

06:18.080 --> 06:19.880
Get up. Face the wall
before I snatch

06:19.880 --> 06:21.460
the other eye
out of your head.

06:21.460 --> 06:24.080
You need
to learn some respect.

06:24.080 --> 06:26.920
Okay, come on, Officer Chen.
Think like a crook.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.920
When's the last time you hid
anything under a couch,

06:28.920 --> 06:30.790
8th grade?
You know how many times
I couldn't find my phone

06:30.790 --> 06:32.080
and it was under the couch
the whole time?

06:32.080 --> 06:33.460
This isn't that.

06:33.460 --> 06:34.750
You ever heard of
the DEAR method?

06:34.750 --> 06:36.750
D
No.

06:36.750 --> 06:38.580
There are four principles
of concealment.

06:38.580 --> 06:40.830
First is deception --
"D."

06:40.830 --> 06:42.960
Deception shows you
one thing

06:42.960 --> 06:45.170

something else.

09:27.620 --> 09:29.290
Is something wrong?

09:29.290 --> 09:31.420
No, honey.
They're friends of your father.

09:31.420 --> 09:33.540
Jump in the car.
We'll head to school in a sec.

09:39.710 --> 09:42.040
I'm sorry.
I made a mistake calling you.

09:44.210 --> 09:45.620
No, you didn't.

09:45.620 --> 09:47.000
Clearly something happened
last night

09:47.000 --> 09:48.080
that made you
call 911.

09:49.580 --> 09:50.920
What was it?

09:54.500 --> 09:57.330
Logan was at his grandmother's
across the street,

09:57.330 --> 09:59.500
so I had a date over.

09:59.500 --> 10:02.580
Things started
heating up,

10:02.580 --> 10:05.000
and that's when
he stormed in drunk.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.420
He being your husband?

10:06.420 --> 10:10.080
Soon-to-be ex.
I just filed for divorce.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.620
Usually I can keep him calm,

10:12.620 --> 10:15.830
but when he saw Mike,
he pulled out a gun.

10:15.830 --> 10:18.620
He hit him in the face. He made
him leave in his underwear.

10:18.620 --> 10:20.170
Said it was called
"walking the plank."

10:20.170 --> 10:22.000
-No, never.

10:23.830 --> 10:27.250
It's just he's been acting
so crazy since I served papers.

10:27.250 --> 10:29.460
You told your son that we were
friends of his father's.

10:29.460 --> 10:31.920
I'm guessing that means
your husband's a cop?

10:31.920 --> 10:32.960
Last name Mitchell?

10:35.040 --> 10:38.210
My maiden name
is Mitchell, actually.

10:38.210 --> 10:39.620
My married name
is Hawke.

10:42.040 --> 10:43.960
Your husband's
Jeremy Hawke?

10:43.960 --> 10:47.290
Yes, and that's why
I shouldn't have called.

10:47.290 --> 10:49.460
He could lose his job
over this, his pension.

10:49.460 --> 10:52.460
I understand, but what
you described are crimes.

10:52.460 --> 10:54.330
Assault and battery,
brandishing a firearm.

10:56.170 --> 10:57.540
Does this mean
you're gonna arrest him?

11:01.120 --> 11:03.000
It means we're gonna
call the watch commander

11:03.000 --> 11:05.670

a champion at the Academy.

11:13.290 --> 11:15.080
I sure didn't.

11:15.080 --> 11:16.580
Hawke saw
something in me,

11:16.580 --> 11:19.460
probably because
we were closer in age

11:19.460 --> 11:22.330
than most of the rookies.
Bonded over our kids.

11:22.330 --> 11:24.920
Yeah, his was a little younger
than Henry,

11:24.920 --> 11:27.000
but since I'd already
been through all the
terrible teenage years,

11:27.000 --> 11:28.830
I gave him some
hard-earned pointers.

11:28.830 --> 11:30.500
Never took it easy
on me, though.
