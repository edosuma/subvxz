Good morning,
Uncle Donald.

00:31.411 --> 00:33.747
You can't wear this
to your job interview.

00:33.943 --> 00:35.919
(sputtering)
My uniform!

00:36.466 --> 00:38.169
You gotta dress
for the job you want,

00:38.238 --> 00:41.482
not the job you have,
which is no job.

00:42.289 --> 00:43.622
Wah!

00:44.039 --> 00:46.982
Huey, don't touch
the stove. It's hot!

00:47.291 --> 00:49.258
But it's a big day,
and a big day

00:49.333 --> 00:51.271
calls for a big breakfast!

00:51.490 --> 00:53.362
(deflating sound)

00:53.772 --> 00:55.169
Bleh!

00:55.740 --> 00:57.232
I'll get the iron.

00:57.755 --> 00:59.396
Ouch! Ooch.

00:59.591 --> 01:01.503
(sputtering)

01:01.873 --> 01:04.568
Stop helping me.
And put on your life vests!

01:04.638 --> 01:07.309
What if the boat goes down
while the babysitter's here?

01:07.344 --> 01:09.244
BOTH: Yes, Uncle Donald.

01:12.630 --> 01:14.287
Where is that babysitter?

01:15.021 --> 01:16.771
Where are you?!

01:17.099 --> 01:18.153
What?

01:18.263 --> 01:20.888
I didn't give you
a new address.

01:21.078 --> 01:23.451
Well, what time
<i>can</i> you get here?

01:23.787 --> 01:26.287
I... don't know.

01:26.755 --> 01:28.310
Crazy old bird.

01:28.458 --> 01:31.412
Where can I find
another babysitter at 10:00?

01:31.505 --> 01:33.732
- 10:00?!
- You gotta go!

01:34.719 --> 01:35.826
Aah!

01:36.732 --> 01:38.208
I can't just leave you!

01:38.341 --> 01:40.818
We can survive
for a couple of hours!

01:40.982 --> 01:44.505
A couple of hours.
Uh... well, okay.

01:44.591 --> 01:47.185
But just keep
those life vests on!

01:47.233 --> 01:49.324
(engine starts)

01:50.602 --> 01:51.953
- Where's Dewey?
- Sleeping.

01:52.001 --> 01:53.250
Who's Dewey?

01:56.500 --> 01:58.227
Who's Dewey?

01:58.371 --> 02:01.184
All right, boys,
we'll getto Cape Suzette and back

02:01.232 --> 02:03.265
before anyone realizes
we're gone.

02:03.300 --> 02:06.268
So long, Dorkburg!
Hello...

02:06.386 --> 02:08.070
Uncle Donald?

02:08.104 --> 02:09.437
What... What's up?

02:09.675 --> 02:12.339
I can't leave you boys
alone for one minute!

02:12.464 --> 02:15.285
You were supposed to get
him out by 10:00, Hubert!

02:15.410 --> 02:18.346
You were supposed to signal before
you started the boat, Dewford!

02:18.394 --> 02:20.183
We never get
to do anything!

02:20.231 --> 02:24.136
Boys, if we want to keep
our home afloat,

02:24.949 --> 02:28.074
we've all got to do things
we don't want to do.

02:28.147 --> 02:29.179
(beeps)

02:29.238 --> 02:31.464
<i>Destination:
McDuck Manor.</i>

02:31.535 --> 02:34.183
McDuck Manor?
As in Scrooge McDuck?

02:34.285 --> 02:35.808
The bajillionaire?

02:35.917 --> 02:37.527
You're finally
gonna sell us.

02:37.597 --> 02:41.261
I'm not gonna sell...
He owes me.

02:41.378 --> 02:43.071
We're gonna meet
Scrooge McDuck?

02:43.107 --> 02:44.441
- That guy's amazing!
- What!

02:44.511 --> 02:47.418
I heard he's so epic
he defeated a rock giant

02:47.488 --> 02:49.987
and carved a statue
of himself out of its legs!

02:50.035 --> 02:53.090
I heard he's so smart he solved
the mystery of the Chupacabra.

02:53.138 --> 02:54.831
Turns out it was
just a shaved bear!

02:54.879 --> 02:58.456
I heard that he's so rich
he only hunts for treasure

02:58.504 --> 03:00.535
to swim in it!

03:01.199 --> 03:03.301
All right, take it
down a notch.

03:03.363 --> 03:05.246
It's only a couple of hours.

03:05.301 --> 03:09.621
A couple of hours with the most
exciting duck in the world!

03:09.840 --> 03:12.246
With business expanding
in the Spoonerville

03:12.294 --> 03:17.631
and St. Canard markets,
noted in Appendices C, G and 5F,

03:17.764 --> 03:20.537

Historical Research,
Experimental Tech,

03:23.139 --> 03:24.537
Deep Sea Exploration...

03:24.623 --> 03:27.365
Fantastic.

03:32.470 --> 03:33.923

eh, Mr. McD?

04:02.813 --> 04:04.360
(laughs) Been there.

04:04.423 --> 04:05.890
I don't have
an office, per se,

04:05.938 --> 04:08.829
but in some ways
the road is my office.

04:09.220 --> 04:12.094
Hey, that's deep.
I gotta write that down.

04:12.254 --> 04:14.267
(crash)

04:16.212 --> 04:18.720
Geh! Eyes on the road, McQuack!

04:18.875 --> 04:21.358
Every dent is coming
out of your salary.

04:21.406 --> 04:24.118
Absolutely.
Hey, ya read about

04:24.173 --> 04:26.681
that crazy snowstorm
on the Drake Barrier Reef?

04:26.736 --> 04:28.665
I'd hate to fly
into that one.

04:28.713 --> 04:32.415
See, I'm a bit of a pilot,
and, uh... Oh, okay.

04:32.463 --> 04:34.673
Divider... there you go.

04:38.806 --> 04:39.939
Hit the brakes!

04:39.987 --> 04:41.290
(tires squealing)

04:42.345 --> 04:43.408
Ech.

04:43.456 --> 04:44.821
Why aren't we moving?

04:44.939 --> 04:46.712
Mrs. B., open up!

04:46.798 --> 04:48.522
I need to get
out of here before...

04:48.557 --> 04:49.587
(honking)

04:49.635 --> 04:51.251
he shows up.

04:51.530 --> 04:53.642
Hey! Jettison that jalopy

04:53.729 --> 04:56.864
from my driveway
this instant, ya deadbeat!

05:02.116 --> 05:03.448
Donald Duck.

05:03.593 --> 05:05.314
Uncle Scrooge.

05:05.381 --> 05:10.584
Uncle Scrooge!
(all jeering)

05:13.150 --> 05:15.267
So, you're looking good.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.316
Still living
on that boat?

05:18.621 --> 05:21.488
Yup. Still a trillionaire?

05:22.625 --> 05:24.024
(bird calls)

05:24.759 --> 05:26.017
Good, good.

05:26.065 --> 05:27.259
So...

05:27.310 --> 05:29.010
So...

05:29.130 --> 05:30.789
Jettison that jalopy

05:30.837 --> 05:34.368
from my driveway
this instant, you deadbeat!

05:34.416 --> 05:35.532
Oh, here we go!

05:35.580 --> 05:38.767
Giving orders like he's
the richest duck in the world!

05:38.841 --> 05:40.984
I am the richest duck
in the world!

05:41.032 --> 05:43.024
- Now move!
- I would love to!

05:43.072 --> 05:45.462
It just so happens
I have a job interview.

05:45.510 --> 05:47.290
So why are you
standing there yelling?

05:47.338 --> 05:49.985
Mrs. B. said that you
would watch the boys!

05:50.046 --> 05:52.642
Can you do that
without losing them?!

05:52.690 --> 05:54.915
- Of course I can!
- Fantastic!

05:54.970 --> 05:57.368
Thank you so much!

05:57.486 --> 05:59.759
You're welcome!
Wait, what now?

05:59.807 --> 06:00.812
(car door slams)

06:00.860 --> 06:03.853
Huey, Dewey, Louie,
meet Scrooge McDuck.

06:03.939 --> 06:07.531
Remember, no tricks,
no lies, no trouble.

06:07.579 --> 06:09.493
ALL: Yes, Uncle Donald.

06:09.598 --> 06:12.087
I wasn't talking to you.

06:29.619 --> 06:31.173
Whoa!

06:34.368 --> 06:36.603
Talk to your nephews.

06:38.897 --> 06:40.624
Ew.

06:41.663 --> 06:42.819
(startles)

06:43.124 --> 06:48.163
So, do children
still like marbles or...?

06:48.263 --> 06:50.263
- Are you really our uncle?
- How old are you?

06:50.311 --> 06:51.335
What's your net worth?

06:51.383 --> 06:52.492
What's the deal with you
and Uncle Donald?

06:52.539 --> 06:54.101
Is that fork real silver?
Can I have it?

06:54.149 --> 06:55.812
- How come you never visit?
- 'Cause you're so old

06:55.859 --> 06:56.968
and moving is so hard?

06:57.016 --> 06:58.873
You owe us, like,
a lot of birthday presents.

06:58.921 --> 07:02.507
You used to be a big deal!
Whatever happened to you?

07:03.155 --> 07:04.483
Beakley!

07:04.811 --> 07:05.944
Aah!

07:05.999 --> 07:07.460
You agreed to watch them.

07:07.508 --> 07:08.851
Watch them.

07:09.173 --> 07:13.175
Huey, Louie,
the third one...

07:15.173 --> 07:18.632
Please do not leave
the designated play area.

07:18.686 --> 07:21.054
- (clinks)
- A gift from your great-uncle.

07:21.134 --> 07:23.210
You will return them
upon your departure.

07:23.263 --> 07:25.163
He's counted them.

07:25.233 --> 07:26.327
(lock clicks)

07:26.375 --> 07:28.779
Great. Now we've got
two boring uncles.

07:28.827 --> 07:30.784
So, we're totally
ditching this room, right?

07:30.866 --> 07:34.304
Yup, and I know
just how to do it.

07:34.444 --> 07:35.543
(gasps)

07:45.594 --> 07:46.961
(grumbling)

07:47.139 --> 07:49.735
"Used to be a big deal."

07:50.094 --> 07:51.844
(beating)

07:51.953 --> 07:54.352
Stupid doorknob,
come off!

07:54.400 --> 07:55.415
Nailed it!

07:55.463 --> 07:57.563
Can't believe that
was your best plan.

07:57.611 --> 08:01.782
Come on, guys, let's go touch
some expensive stuff.

08:01.868 --> 08:04.219
- Aah!
- Dewey!

08:04.587 --> 08:06.133
BOTH: Aah!

08:06.961 --> 08:09.439
Ah, ha ah! I'll put the marbles back,
I swear!

08:09.475 --> 08:12.313
Who sent you?
Ma Beagle? Glomgold?

08:12.385 --> 08:13.914
Answer me!

08:14.008 --> 08:18.248
(sobbing) Uncle Scrooge!

08:18.368 --> 08:19.657
<i>Uncle</i> Scrooge?

08:19.735 --> 08:22.368
Oh, my gosh,
the nephews!

08:22.922 --> 08:25.556
- Wait, you know us?
- (grunting)

08:25.672 --> 08:29.383
Of course! Researching Mr. McDuck
and his family is kind of my hobby.

08:29.461 --> 08:31.361
- What?
- What are your blood types?

08:31.397 --> 08:33.633
What's Donald really like?
Who's the evil triplet?

08:33.681 --> 08:34.860
- Louie.
- Eh.

08:34.946 --> 08:36.985
Tell me everything!

08:37.477 --> 08:38.946
Um, we live
with our uncle?

08:38.994 --> 08:40.313
On a boat?

08:40.469 --> 08:41.663
Go on.

08:41.711 --> 08:42.703
Kinda it.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.577
We're just a normal,
boring family.

08:44.625 --> 08:47.243
Normal, boring? Hah!

08:47.339 --> 08:48.828
ALL: Ohh!

08:50.282 --> 08:52.416
Whoa!

08:52.451 --> 08:54.250
Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck,

08:54.331 --> 08:56.702
Scrooge McDuck's great-nephews
on his sister Hortense's side

08:56.750 --> 08:58.321
with Quackmore Duck
twice removed!

08:58.369 --> 09:00.078
And you are?

09:00.126 --> 09:02.193
Oh, right.
Webby van der Quack.

09:02.284 --> 09:03.914
My granny's the housekeeper.

09:04.094 --> 09:06.788
Wait! Are we...
friends now?

09:06.836 --> 09:08.344
If we say yes,
will you let us live?

09:08.392 --> 09:10.860
(scoffs) Good one,
new best friend!

09:14.383 --> 09:17.541
So, friend, what do you
do for fun around here?

09:17.576 --> 09:19.443
Oh! I'm the best at fun.

09:19.478 --> 09:21.545
Um... yah!

09:23.415 --> 09:26.116
At least it's not
the marble room.

09:26.151 --> 09:28.452
(grunting)

09:33.383 --> 09:34.828
Come on, you blaggert.

09:34.876 --> 09:37.361
You won't get the best
of Scrooge McDuck!

09:37.396 --> 09:39.463
Hmm. A little spring cleaning?

09:39.498 --> 09:42.008
Maybe. Maybe not.
Read this.

09:42.758 --> 09:45.243
Snow on the Drake Barrier Reef.

09:45.317 --> 09:47.250
First time in 50 years.

09:47.298 --> 09:49.524
That weather report
aligns perfectly

09:49.618 --> 09:51.308
with the Papia Prophecy.

09:51.343 --> 09:56.367
A shift in currents may present
a pathway to Atlantis,

09:56.415 --> 09:59.270
lost city under the sea!

09:59.318 --> 10:01.993
This is because some children
made fun of you, isn't it?

10:02.085 --> 10:05.266
Nonsense! I'm no has-been.
They're the has-beens.

10:05.314 --> 10:07.047
I am an am-now.

10:07.102 --> 10:08.197
Make a list!

10:08.245 --> 10:09.524
Four oxygen tanks,

10:09.572 --> 10:11.395
two pressure gauges,
a pilot...

10:11.430 --> 10:13.157
- I'm a pilot.
- A week's provisions,

10:13.205 --> 10:15.553
- an experimental deep-sea sub...
- I'm a pilot.

10:15.621 --> 10:17.328
And one secretary
for an old man

10:17.376 --> 10:21.563
who seems to have forgotten
that I am not his secretary!

10:23.555 --> 10:26.696
So, eh, not interested?

10:26.887 --> 10:29.321
I have enough excitement
caring for Webby.

10:29.383 --> 10:31.985
Perhaps you should spend
some time with your family.

10:32.033 --> 10:36.985
Oh, hang up my spats, become the doddering
old relic everyone thinks I am,

10:37.063 --> 10:39.256
spinning yarns
to those loud-mouth young'uns

10:39.291 --> 10:40.590
about the man
I used to be?

10:40.626 --> 10:43.500
You have avoided them
for ten years!

10:43.578 --> 10:47.508
Because family
is nothing but trouble!

10:47.648 --> 10:49.625
(gasps) Oh.

10:50.703 --> 10:52.469
I'm Scrooge McDuck.

10:52.571 --> 10:55.372
I made my name being
tougher than the toughies

10:55.422 --> 10:57.024
and smarter
than the smarties.

10:57.128 --> 11:00.129
And I made my money
square, on my own,

11:00.212 --> 11:03.625
no nephews, no family,
no one helped me there,

11:03.696 --> 11:05.415
and I don't
need help now, and...

11:05.451 --> 11:07.188
(clattering)

11:07.602 --> 11:09.713
Beakley,
a little help.

11:12.861 --> 11:14.595
Maybe they're right.

11:17.673 --> 11:19.235
Whoo! Vent crawl!

11:19.610 --> 11:21.087
(both groan)

11:21.220 --> 11:22.876
You don't get
out much, do you?

11:22.924 --> 11:25.056
Eh, Granny's a bit
overprotective.

11:25.120 --> 11:26.751
She trains me
to be ready for anything,

11:26.799 --> 11:29.751
but then she says I've got
everything I need in here.

11:29.978 --> 11:32.371
But one day,
I'm gonna see the world.

11:32.478 --> 11:36.517
I'm gonna be an explorer!
I'm gonna eat a hamburger.

11:36.648 --> 11:38.431
We could bring you
a hamburger.

11:38.564 --> 11:40.550
You really are
my best friends.

11:44.226 --> 11:48.283
Welcome
to the Wing of Secrets!

11:57.118 --> 11:58.929
I knew it!

11:59.375 --> 12:00.708
Dewey, check it out!

12:01.015 --> 12:02.843
Yeah, whatever.

12:03.406 --> 12:05.398
The Gong of Picchu.

12:05.656 --> 12:10.447
Hit it three times
to unleash unspeakable evil.

12:13.553 --> 12:14.686
Uh, what are you doing?

12:14.734 --> 12:16.593
Calling dibs on stuff!

12:16.755 --> 12:19.609
What? Scrooge is, like,
he's, like, super old.

12:19.658 --> 12:21.976
Oh, careful!
Medusa gauntlet.

12:22.024 --> 12:24.836
One touch can turn
organic matter to stone.

12:24.890 --> 12:26.476
(imitates solidifying)

12:26.678 --> 12:28.414
I'm gonna call
this one a maybe.

12:28.500 --> 12:30.467
This place is incredible!

12:30.523 --> 12:32.169
It's fake.

12:35.453 --> 12:37.297
Is that Uncle Donald?

12:37.409 --> 12:40.054
Oh, yeah, he was
Mr. McDuck's sidekick!

12:40.672 --> 12:42.717
- Dewey's right.
- Totally fake.

12:42.765 --> 12:45.093
Uncle Donald has never
done anything cool.

12:45.163 --> 12:50.233
What? Donald Duck is one of the most
daring adventurers of all time!

12:50.355 --> 12:52.203
(stuttering)

12:52.424 --> 12:54.328
(phone rings)

12:54.493 --> 12:55.797
(shiny ring)

13:00.108 --> 13:01.408
Bop bop.

13:02.023 --> 13:03.366
Bop.

13:03.484 --> 13:04.836
Yo, chung chung!

13:04.906 --> 13:06.005
Bop bop!

13:06.212 --> 13:10.181
(exclaiming)

13:13.567 --> 13:15.545
(yelling)

13:17.317 --> 13:18.840
This has got to be a fake.

13:18.889 --> 13:20.889
And I bet
everything else is, too.

13:20.979 --> 13:22.278
That's not true!

13:22.421 --> 13:24.521
What about this picture
with chupacabra?

13:24.556 --> 13:27.684
- Photoshop.
- This treasure chest?

13:27.744 --> 13:29.621
Probably bought it
at an auction.

13:30.395 --> 13:32.629
This... g-ghost?

13:32.910 --> 13:36.199
You mean this
Halloween decoration?

13:38.525 --> 13:41.744
Curse ye,
ye scurvy life-lubbers!

13:41.837 --> 13:45.071
It's Captain Peghook,
the scourge of the River Styx!

13:45.310 --> 13:48.499
It's real.
It's really, really real!

13:48.658 --> 13:50.247
(evil laughter)

13:50.486 --> 13:52.033
The Deus Excalibur!

13:52.117 --> 13:54.117
It won't rest
until its target's slain!

13:54.319 --> 13:56.520
But he's already dead!

13:56.671 --> 13:58.585
(gong rings)

13:58.842 --> 14:01.491
(gasps) Do not let
anything else hit that gong!

14:01.585 --> 14:03.527
Yep, I'm gonna
sit this one out.

14:03.562 --> 14:05.395
- Whoa! Aah!
- (whinnies)

14:05.430 --> 14:06.530
(exclaims)

14:06.565 --> 14:08.803
The headless man-horse!

14:08.851 --> 14:10.475
That one feels
self-explanatory.

14:10.536 --> 14:12.251
(rings)

14:12.533 --> 14:13.603
That's twice!

14:13.651 --> 14:16.150
One more, and something
terrible could happen!

14:16.231 --> 14:18.078
What could be
worse than this?

14:18.126 --> 14:21.939
What in dismal downs
is going on in here?

14:22.517 --> 14:24.376
ALL: There it is.

14:26.645 --> 14:28.305
Why aren't you
in your rooms?

14:28.439 --> 14:30.086
(screaming)

14:30.122 --> 14:31.188
Rrrawgh!

14:31.250 --> 14:33.494
- Aah!
- (evil laughter)

14:34.026 --> 14:35.392
(grunts)

14:37.014 --> 14:38.294
(neighs)

14:41.299 --> 14:42.650
We've got this.

14:42.698 --> 14:44.369
There are four of us
and three of them.

14:44.418 --> 14:46.924
If we... wait, never mind.
They teamed up.

14:47.056 --> 14:48.853
(evil laughter)

14:48.959 --> 14:51.313
Ah, good, that means
only one target.

14:51.361 --> 14:53.259
No, get back!
You're old!

14:53.323 --> 14:58.165
Oi, beastie! What's it gonna take to
shuffle you off to the afterlife?

14:58.298 --> 15:01.798
The head
of Scrooge McDuck!

15:01.967 --> 15:03.728
(cracking)

15:04.579 --> 15:06.156
Would you settle
for his hat?

15:06.207 --> 15:07.525
(roaring)

15:09.400 --> 15:11.061
(groans)

15:15.599 --> 15:17.300
(blade rings)

15:19.911 --> 15:21.938
There's your head.

15:23.175 --> 15:27.043
I should've been
more specific!

15:35.187 --> 15:36.353
(whinnies)

15:36.388 --> 15:40.323
(celebrating)

15:40.435 --> 15:41.943
(pounds)

15:42.111 --> 15:43.344
We can explain.

15:43.395 --> 15:46.458
We came down to your secret
museum to look for you,

15:46.529 --> 15:49.458
because we love you?

15:49.591 --> 15:51.310
Secret museum?

15:51.446 --> 15:53.313
This is the gar-age!

15:54.351 --> 15:55.578
The what?

15:55.626 --> 15:56.960
Do you mean "garage"?

15:57.008 --> 15:58.945
No, that's ridiculous.

15:59.077 --> 16:01.773
If this is a garage,
then how do you explain

16:01.821 --> 16:03.601
all this amazing stuff?

16:03.687 --> 16:06.316
Like the garden hose
of destiny?

16:06.351 --> 16:09.319
Or Montezuma's stack
of old magazines?

16:09.408 --> 16:12.999
Or... Oh, yeah,
it's a garage.

16:13.095 --> 16:16.196
Unbelievable.
I invite you into my home...

16:16.263 --> 16:17.976
You locked us
in a room!

16:18.024 --> 16:19.413
I gave you marbles!

16:19.461 --> 16:21.093
All we wanted
was to hand out with you!

16:21.141 --> 16:22.365
Well, now you have,

16:22.413 --> 16:23.835
and look at the mess
it's got me!

16:23.883 --> 16:27.819
I guess family is nothing
but trouble, right, Scrooge?

16:28.585 --> 16:30.921
Everybody out!

16:31.017 --> 16:32.784
- But we're...
- Out!

16:33.905 --> 16:35.145
Well, what are you
gaping at?

16:35.202 --> 16:38.114
The curse is only activated
if you ring the gong three times

16:38.195 --> 16:41.217
and... you already hit it
two times, didn't you?

16:41.299 --> 16:42.687
(crackling)

16:50.112 --> 16:52.570
Pixiu,
the Gold-Hunting Dragon...

16:52.618 --> 16:54.132
Gold hunting?
Sounds great!

16:54.180 --> 16:57.820
Not when you're Duckburg's
single largest owner of gold!

16:57.890 --> 16:59.235
(sniffing)

16:59.271 --> 17:01.971
Aah! Me money bin!

17:03.796 --> 17:06.876
To your rooms!

17:11.499 --> 17:12.882
Where are you going?

17:12.944 --> 17:15.608
I'm gonna go eat
a hamburger!

17:15.821 --> 17:17.194
We're in!

17:17.335 --> 17:18.561
Cool.

17:18.718 --> 17:20.663
To be clear, I'm gonna
go catch the dragon.

17:20.711 --> 17:22.515
The hamburger was
a metaphor from before.

17:22.563 --> 17:24.060
Yeah, yeah, no, we get it.
We get it.

17:24.108 --> 17:25.942
But how are we
gonna get up there?

17:26.056 --> 17:27.554
I'm a pilot.

17:37.702 --> 17:39.070
Ooh! Yeah! Ha ha!

17:39.226 --> 17:41.398
It'll take more
than some fancy flying

17:41.499 --> 17:45.281
to shake old Scrooge,
you cash cannibal! Whoo!

17:45.546 --> 17:48.952
Oh! Ow! Ugh!

17:50.122 --> 17:52.956
It'll take more
than a bruised spine

17:53.004 --> 17:54.504
to shake old Scrooge,

17:54.567 --> 17:57.413
you bad dragon-dog!

18:02.305 --> 18:04.525
Take that!

18:06.972 --> 18:11.274
Nooooooooooo!

18:15.180 --> 18:17.113
(straining)

18:19.174 --> 18:20.381
Whoo-hoo!

18:20.468 --> 18:22.352
I thought I told you
to go to your...

18:22.387 --> 18:24.153
No time.
We gotta work fast.

18:24.201 --> 18:25.911
Webby, how do we stop it?

18:25.959 --> 18:28.345
It's mystical,
so we need a mystical device,

18:28.393 --> 18:31.261
like an oblivion mirror
or a medusa gauntlet, or...

18:31.296 --> 18:33.329
- Like this?
- Grr.

18:33.419 --> 18:35.433
What? I was gonna
give it back.

18:37.936 --> 18:39.799
Now, how do we
get him down there?

18:39.847 --> 18:41.753
Garden hose of destiny!

18:41.935 --> 18:44.209
Launchpad, we need
to swing him out.

18:44.296 --> 18:46.588
Nosedive towards the bin
and get ready to pull up!

18:46.636 --> 18:48.957
Yes, sir, random kid
I just met!

18:50.838 --> 18:54.205
Any questions? -Since
when is Launchpad a pilot?

18:54.319 --> 18:56.019
(clinks)

19:02.541 --> 19:06.082
You guys,
our family is awesome!

19:12.337 --> 19:14.192
ALL: Scrooge!

19:26.638 --> 19:28.182
(gasping)

19:30.917 --> 19:32.487
(cheering)

19:32.589 --> 19:34.735
NEPHEW:
Money! I knew it!

19:35.169 --> 19:38.511
Aw. Family truly is
the greatest adventure of...

19:38.572 --> 19:40.096
Oh, no, the ground!

19:40.131 --> 19:41.131
(crashing)

19:44.123 --> 19:45.829
In the short time
I've known you,

19:45.877 --> 19:48.329
you've wrecked my home
and my money bin,

19:48.377 --> 19:50.499
unleashed several
ancient evils,

19:50.547 --> 19:53.129
and almost don't be killed
twice

19:53.177 --> 19:56.784
Four times if you count each
monster as an individual time...

19:58.884 --> 20:02.487
(laughter)

20:02.608 --> 20:04.220
That was incredible!

20:04.256 --> 20:05.985
When you pulled me
into the airplane

20:06.033 --> 20:07.053
and said "No time!"

20:07.101 --> 20:08.329
And who would have thought

20:08.377 --> 20:10.410
of a Medusa Gauntlet?!
Brilliant!

20:10.489 --> 20:12.669
Oh, and then
you swung me out

20:12.751 --> 20:15.285
and pulled up
just in time and (laughter)

20:15.333 --> 20:17.982
You kids are nothing
but trouble!

20:18.136 --> 20:21.923
Curse me kilts,
have I missed trouble!

20:22.181 --> 20:25.508
I suppose I'll have
to keep an eye on you

20:25.612 --> 20:28.728
to teach you how to get
into trouble properly.

20:28.850 --> 20:30.213
- (phone ringing)
- You mean...?

20:30.248 --> 20:32.383
Beakley! Clear
my schedule!

20:32.478 --> 20:35.473
I'm taking the wee ones
on a field trip.

20:35.525 --> 20:38.928
<i>About time. And once again,
I am not your secre...</i>

20:39.090 --> 20:43.589
Now, let's go find
the lost city of Atlantis!

20:43.737 --> 20:44.935
ALL: Yeah!

20:44.996 --> 20:48.068
And no one tell
your uncle Donald!

20:48.166 --> 20:49.700
ALL: Yeah!

20:49.748 --> 20:50.998
Who is that?

20:51.046 --> 20:52.495
(struggling)

20:52.543 --> 20:54.435
You've got
the job, Duck!

20:54.483 --> 20:55.690
Seriously?

20:55.768 --> 20:57.106
Oh, boy!

20:57.166 --> 20:59.006
I'm a real accountant!

20:59.054 --> 21:01.187
Accountant?
That was filled yesterday.
