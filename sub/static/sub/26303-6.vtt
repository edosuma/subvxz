part about this situation is?

00:21.108 --> 00:22.718

there was this guy

06:14.765 --> 06:17.202
near the gangway.
He was just walking around.

06:17.246 --> 06:20.205
He seemed out of place.

06:20.249 --> 06:21.424
I'm not saying he killed her.

06:21.468 --> 06:23.339
I'm just saying I noticed him.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.341

I mean, African-American.

06:28.953 --> 06:31.303
Um, average height.

06:31.347 --> 06:33.349
Thin and young,
early 20s.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.568
- Did you see
what he was wearing?

06:34.611 --> 06:37.048
- He had a white hat
on his head.

06:37.092 --> 06:38.441
That's all I remember.

06:38.485 --> 06:40.574
But again, I'm not saying
this man is involved.

06:40.617 --> 06:41.749
And it has nothing to do
with the fact

06:41.792 --> 06:43.315
that he's African-American.

06:43.359 --> 06:45.492
- Right, he just
looked suspicious.

06:45.535 --> 06:46.884
Like he was casing the house

06:46.928 --> 06:48.538
that he was about to rob,
right?

06:48.582 --> 06:50.497
- Yeah, he looked suspicious.

06:50.540 --> 06:52.237
Very suspicious.

06:52.281 --> 06:55.458
And...he was holding something
in his right hand, too,

06:55.502 --> 06:57.112

06:59.375 --> 07:01.116

07:10.212 --> 07:12.432

07:53.995 --> 07:55.779

Collier's house,

07:55.823 --> 07:58.303

an image of the blue Honda.

08:01.437 --> 08:02.960

parking decal

- All right.

08:06.398 --> 08:08.531
So, find out who works
there that drives a blue Honda.

08:08.575 --> 08:11.534

by the name of Jerome York.

08:11.578 --> 08:12.970

08:13.014 --> 08:14.885

having problems,

08:29.596 --> 08:31.772
and you keep giving
her rides...

08:32.599 --> 08:34.383

your supervisor,

- I found a surveillance camera

33:04.852 --> 33:06.723
across the street
from the warehouse.

33:06.767 --> 33:08.290
We got a man wearing a hoodie

33:08.334 --> 33:11.511
entering the warehouse at
3:12 p.m. and leaving at 3:21.

33:11.554 --> 33:13.600
- Okay, that makes sense.
The M.E. put the time of death

33:13.643 --> 33:14.775
between 2:30 and 4:00.

33:16.037 --> 33:17.256
- Of him, no.
His car, yes.

33:17.299 --> 33:21.434
I'll pull up the plates
right now.

33:21.477 --> 33:22.652
Oh, my God.

33:22.696 --> 33:24.654
It's Alderman Collier.

33:29.964 --> 33:30.356
.

33:30.399 --> 33:32.358
- So, I've been digging into
Collier's finances.

33:32.401 --> 33:34.012
For starters, he bought

33:34.055 --> 33:35.752
a Cartier watch from Landsberg
Jewelers for 14 grand.

33:35.796 --> 33:37.145
That's the same make that we
found at Nate's house.

33:37.189 --> 33:38.755
- All right, so he did know

33:38.799 --> 33:40.453
it was his wife's watch--that
means he was lying to us.

33:40.496 --> 33:42.542
- He also made two $9,000
withdrawals

33:42.585 --> 33:45.806
while his bro, Nate, made two
$9,000 deposits last week.

33:45.849 --> 33:47.851
- All right, so Collier paid
Nate 18 grand

33:47.895 --> 33:51.116
to whack his wife, and he
whacked Nate to tie things off.

33:51.159 --> 33:53.074
The question is, why?

33:53.118 --> 33:54.684
- I think I have the answer
to that.

33:54.728 --> 33:56.556
Found an email Allison wrote
to one of her friends.

33:56.599 --> 33:58.340
"Need to talk to you about
finding a good lawyer.

33:58.384 --> 34:00.386
Lots to discuss.
None of it good."

34:05.130 --> 34:09.003
- She seemed pretty desperate
to begin the process,

34:09.047 --> 34:11.875
so I gave her the name of a few
divorce lawyers that I know.

34:11.919 --> 34:14.182
- Okay, did she mention why
she wanted to split up?

34:14.226 --> 34:17.272
- Yes.
But given what's happened,

34:17.316 --> 34:19.666
there's probably no point
in talking about it.

34:19.709 --> 34:21.189
- Well, there's
definitely a point.

34:22.538 --> 34:24.366
- We think her husband's
involved.

♪

34:29.110 --> 34:31.721
- Oh, my God.

34:31.765 --> 34:34.898
It was Jason.
It all makes perfect sense.

34:36.422 --> 34:38.902
- Jason Collier was
physically abusing Allison,

34:38.946 --> 34:41.905
and she wanted a divorce.

34:41.949 --> 34:43.733
So he had her killed.

34:46.736 --> 34:48.477
- Afraid so.

34:50.305 --> 34:52.307
- I went by his office,
his house...

34:52.351 --> 34:53.961
He's in the wind.

34:54.004 --> 34:55.441
- Let me reach out to him.

34:55.484 --> 34:57.573
I'll tell him the person we
think is responsible

34:57.617 --> 35:00.881
for Allison's death,
this Nate Stevenson guy,

35:00.924 --> 35:02.665
was just found dead.

35:02.709 --> 35:04.798
The case is officially closed.

35:06.060 --> 35:08.106
- Let me know when and where.

35:08.802 --> 35:12.545
- I had no idea
Jason was capable of this.

35:14.503 --> 35:16.679
- Everyone is capable of this.

35:16.723 --> 35:19.987
It's why we're so busy.

35:31.433 --> 35:32.869
- I know you don't wanna
talk about it.

35:32.913 --> 35:36.438

start a sentence.

35:36.482 --> 35:38.788
- I wanna make sure
you're okay.

35:40.529 --> 35:43.750
- I can't believe
he killed himself.

35:43.793 --> 35:45.969
- I know.
I get it.

35:46.013 --> 35:49.451
- Internal Affairs wants
to look into it now.

35:49.495 --> 35:52.802
Apparently, they have concerns
about my interrogation tactics.

35:52.846 --> 35:54.978
- Screw that.
You did it right.

35:55.022 --> 35:57.329
- Maybe.
- No, definitely.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.768

36:01.811 --> 36:03.378
- Collier's on site.

Hands in the air now.

37:19.411 --> 37:22.892

is her fault.

She made a big deal
over nothing.

37:26.766 --> 37:27.723
Nothing!

37:27.767 --> 37:29.551
I grabbed her arms a few times.

That doesn't mean she gets

38:22.648 --> 38:23.779
And then he reached
into his waistband

38:23.823 --> 38:25.390

38:25.433 --> 38:27.609
- But you didn't engage.

why Hailey didn't fire

38:36.618 --> 38:38.707

She knew I was there.
She knew I had the shot,

38:42.581 --> 38:44.365
