# I see trees of green #

00:44.327 --> 00:47.694
# Red roses too #

00:47.730 --> 00:51.029
# I see them bloom #

00:51.067 --> 00:53.433
# For me and you #

00:53.469 --> 00:58.702
# And I think to myself #

00:58.741 --> 01:02.507
# What a wonderful world #

01:06.682 --> 01:10.948
# I see skies of blue #

01:10.987 --> 01:13.649
# And clouds of white #

01:14.657 --> 01:17.922
# The bright blessed day #

01:17.960 --> 01:20.485
# The dark sacred night #

01:20.530 --> 01:25.593
# And I think to myself #

01:25.635 --> 01:30.072
# What a wonderful world #

01:32.208 --> 01:34.438
# Yes #

01:34.477 --> 01:38.345
# I think to myself #

01:39.849 --> 01:41.783
# What a wonderful #

01:45.488 --> 01:47.080
Yes, dude!

01:47.123 --> 01:49.819
What the fuck? What the fuck?
What are you doing?

01:49.859 --> 01:52.692
I'm taking the most incredible dump
of all time, man.

01:52.728 --> 01:54.355
You couldn't wait
till I got out of the shower?

01:54.397 --> 01:58.299
May I remind you that
we both just ate 30 burgers...

01:58.334 --> 02:00.529
and four large orders of fries?

02:02.438 --> 02:04.872
Don't worry, in a little bit,
I'm sure it'll hit you too.

02:04.907 --> 02:08.138
It may be. But I'm gonna wait
till you get out of the shower.

02:08.176 --> 02:11.237
Well, don't wait too long. We've got
to leave for the airport in an hour.

02:11.280 --> 02:12.269
Ooh, that burns.

02:12.315 --> 02:15.341
- An hour?
- Hey, and, Roldy?

02:16.085 --> 02:17.780
Yeah?

02:17.820 --> 02:19.549
Nice pubes.

02:20.089 --> 02:22.148
Asshole, get out of here right now.

02:22.191 --> 02:25.888
- Wipe and leave. Wipe and leave now!
- Dude, this thing is huge!

02:25.928 --> 02:27.987
I think it still has cheese on it.

# I'm hangin' with the ballers,

02:46.148 --> 02:48.275
# I can tell you what they say, haters,

# They say ooh wee #

02:50.686 --> 02:52.984

# I'm a bad motherfucker
I'm way too fuckin' cold #

03:08.671 --> 03:11.231
# Let me tell you what they say

03:11.274 --> 03:15.040
# They say ooh wee #

# Aiyo, aiyo #

03:32.194 --> 03:34.162
# My game's here to party
just to cut up a rug #

03:34.196 --> 03:35.629
# Don't make me have to cut up a thug #

03:35.665 --> 03:38.634
# Now play something for me, DJ,
'cause there's nothin' but love #

03:38.668 --> 03:41.193
# Hosted by the ladies
who lookin' for somethin' to rub #

03:52.715 --> 03:55.479
# Ooh wee #

03:55.818 --> 03:58.013
Dude. Oh, my Go...
I just realized something.

03:58.054 --> 03:59.043
What?

03:59.088 --> 04:01.852
Maria's gonna think I'm a stalker, man.
I'm following her to Amsterdam.

04:01.891 --> 04:05.156
Dude, relax. I have a med school
interview in ten minutes.

04:05.194 --> 04:06.957
You don't see me freaking out.

04:06.996 --> 04:09.226
Don't worry, man,
she'll be psyched to see you.

04:09.265 --> 04:10.892
Oh, psyched? You think
she's gonna be psyched?

04:10.933 --> 04:13.060
Totes, dude. Why wouldn't she be?

04:13.135 --> 04:14.430
So how does this work?

04:14.437 --> 04:17.769
We just... we show up in Amsterdam
and we start calling hotels...

04:17.807 --> 04:19.707
and ask if they have
a Maria staying there?

04:19.742 --> 04:22.233
- I don't even know her last name.
- Dude, it's totally cool.

04:22.278 --> 04:24.109
We're definitely gonna find her.

04:24.146 --> 04:25.943
Amsterdam is a very small place.
It's not gonna be...

04:25.982 --> 04:28.746
Sir, I need you to step aside, please.
Let me search you.

04:28.784 --> 04:30.581
- Did I beep?
- No, you didn't beep.

04:30.620 --> 04:31.712
Just a random security check.

04:31.754 --> 04:34.222
If you could just step aside, please?
Just over here.

04:34.256 --> 04:36.747
- Random, huh?
- Yeah.

04:36.792 --> 04:39.420
So this has nothing to do
with my ethnicity?

04:39.462 --> 04:41.089
Kumar, just do what the guy says.

04:41.130 --> 04:43.291
Sir, it's our job as airport security...

04:43.332 --> 04:46.233
to search for all possible weapons
or illegal drugs.

04:46.268 --> 04:49.169
So just because of the color of my skin,
you assume that I have drugs on me?

04:49.205 --> 04:50.797
- No, he's...
- What are you, a racist?

04:50.840 --> 04:53.968
Racist? Dude, I'm black.

04:54.010 --> 04:56.478
He's black. He's not a racist.

04:57.013 --> 04:59.174
Please, dude, you're barely even brown.

04:59.215 --> 05:01.080
No, he didn't mean that.

05:01.117 --> 05:02.846
Compared to me,
you look like Matthew Perry.

05:02.885 --> 05:04.853
Hey, who you calling Matthew Perry, bitch?

05:04.887 --> 05:07.856
I'm calling you Matthew Perry,
you Matthew Perry-looking bitch!

05:07.890 --> 05:09.881
No, there's nobody here
who is Matthew Perry. No one!

05:09.925 --> 05:11.449
What is going on here?

05:11.494 --> 05:14.986
Sir, Matthew Perry over here thinks
that I have illegal narcotics on me...

05:15.031 --> 05:16.430
because I'm a minority.

05:16.465 --> 05:18.365
This is textbook racial profiling...

05:18.401 --> 05:20.392
and I'd be more than happy
to call the ACLU or the government...

05:20.436 --> 05:22.904
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Sorry for the inconvenience, sir.

05:22.938 --> 05:25.805
- You can move along.
- I appreciate it. Thanks, Matt Perry.

05:27.243 --> 05:28.505
Hey, what are you doing?

05:28.544 --> 05:30.512
What do you mean, what am I doing?
He called me Matthew Perry.

05:30.546 --> 05:31.843
Well, you look like Matthew Perry.

05:31.881 --> 05:33.712
- He's white!
- So what?

05:33.749 --> 05:36.081
Why does everything have to become
a huge argument with you, man?

05:36.118 --> 05:37.551
'Cause this is America, dude...

05:37.586 --> 05:40.316
and as long as I have my freedom
of speech, no one's gonna shut me up.

05:40.356 --> 05:41.880
Kumar?

05:44.894 --> 05:46.054
Roldy?

05:46.095 --> 05:49.155
- Vanessa.
- Oh, my God!

05:49.198 --> 05:52.565
- Good to see you.
- So good to see you. l...

05:52.601 --> 05:54.728
- Hi. Hey.
- Hey.

05:54.770 --> 05:55.862
Hey.

05:55.905 --> 05:59.341
God, it's been forever.
What are you guys doing?

05:59.375 --> 06:01.843
We're actually on our way
to Amsterdam.

06:01.877 --> 06:03.071
- Amsterdam?
- Yeah.

06:03.112 --> 06:04.841
Well, you guys haven't changed.

06:04.880 --> 06:07.940
You have. You look amazing.
Your hair is diff...

06:07.983 --> 06:10.918
- Doesn't she look amazing?
- Yeah.

06:10.953 --> 06:13.046
Yeah, you look great.
You look awesome. Sorry.

06:13.089 --> 06:16.081
What am I even saying?
You look different and...

06:16.125 --> 06:19.720
- Kumar Patel, you're flustered.
- Little bit.

06:21.564 --> 06:26.058
So, what's up with you? You still dating
the Abercrombie-wearing douchebag?

06:26.102 --> 06:28.229
Actually, it's Brooks Brothers.

06:28.270 --> 06:31.239
Colton! How are you, buddy?

06:31.273 --> 06:32.865
- Good to see ya.
- Good to see you.

06:32.908 --> 06:34.671
And we're not dating anymore.

06:34.710 --> 06:37.076
No. We... are getting married.

06:38.013 --> 06:39.947
Congratulations, you guys.

06:39.982 --> 06:42.507
- You're fucking getting married?
- Yeah.

06:42.551 --> 06:45.486
- When?
- Next week.

06:46.222 --> 06:48.190
It's going to be a perfect day.

06:48.224 --> 06:50.658
I mean, that's assuming we get
those Stargazer lilies for the bouquets.

06:50.693 --> 06:52.684
This florist has been
a complete nightmare.

06:52.728 --> 06:54.628
Fucking assholes.

06:54.663 --> 06:57.427
Colton's practically planning
the whole wedding all by himself.

06:57.466 --> 07:00.731
So, Rold, Brewster Keegan letting you
off the leash for a little vay-cay?

07:00.770 --> 07:03.796
I own that place now, Colton.

07:03.839 --> 07:05.636
Thank you so much for the hook-up.

07:05.674 --> 07:09.041
Hey, I ran into Todd,
at Whitaker's, of course.

07:09.078 --> 07:11.546
He told me you got a job
working for the government.

07:11.580 --> 07:14.014
Yeah! Yeah, President Bush and my dad
were in the same fraternity.

07:14.049 --> 07:15.380
- Oh, that's right.
- Oh, Jesus.

07:15.417 --> 07:17.408
Yeah, yeah, when he gave my dad that
appointment at the Defense Department...

07:17.453 --> 07:19.546
- I became his right-hand man.
- Douche.

07:19.588 --> 07:20.748
The President's supposed to be
at our wedding...

07:20.790 --> 07:22.883
- but you know how busy he is.
- Yeah.

07:22.925 --> 07:24.722
Sounds like an incredible job, man.

07:24.760 --> 07:27.228
Hey, you really got
some major connections to the top.

07:27.263 --> 07:29.731
If you ever need anything, I'm your man.

07:29.765 --> 07:31.995
- Thank you so much, buddy.
- Anytime.

07:32.034 --> 07:33.763
This guy's the best.

07:33.803 --> 07:36.363
- So, sweetheart, we should get going.
- Yes.

07:36.405 --> 07:39.067
- Good to see you guys again.
- Congratulations again.

07:39.108 --> 07:41.474
- Thank you. Take care, thank you.
- It's so nice.

07:41.510 --> 07:43.000
- Bye.
- Bye.

07:57.126 --> 07:58.593
Dude, I can't believe
they're getting married.

07:58.627 --> 08:00.618
We've only been broken up two years.

08:01.297 --> 08:03.162
Plus that dude has date-rape face.

08:03.199 --> 08:05.292
I don't even know what that is.

08:05.334 --> 08:07.825
One who possesses
the face of a date rapist.

08:07.870 --> 08:11.169
Right. Listen...

08:11.207 --> 08:13.675
I'm sorry, bro.

08:13.709 --> 08:16.337
But we are going to Amsterdam.
Come on.

08:16.378 --> 08:19.541
This is true. This is true, Roldy.

08:19.582 --> 08:21.709
# Ooh wee #

08:25.354 --> 08:28.687
- Man, this is so not like me.
- Yeah.

08:28.724 --> 08:32.216
It's like I'm a whole new Harold.
Better, faster, stronger.

08:32.260 --> 08:33.922
Nice.

08:33.962 --> 08:35.020
Man, I've never used a sick day before.

08:35.063 --> 08:38.260
I'm taking a whole week off
from work here, man.

08:38.299 --> 08:42.066
And in less than eight hours,
we're gonna be in Amsterdam.

08:42.104 --> 08:44.595
- This is nuts. This is nuts.
- I know, dude.

08:44.640 --> 08:46.631
It's gonna be exactly like <i>Euro Trip,</i>
only it's not gonna suck.

08:46.675 --> 08:50.236
- It's gonna be awesome.
- It's not not gonna be awesome.

09:29.618 --> 09:32.985
Dude. Dude, this chick's giving me
such a boner, it's awesome.

09:33.022 --> 09:34.956
Thank you. You ruined the moment.

09:37.026 --> 09:38.493
She's all yours, buddy.

09:38.527 --> 09:40.427
- You wanna pause it?
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

09:40.462 --> 09:42.157
No, that's...

09:42.197 --> 09:43.858
Enjoy.

09:54.777 --> 09:56.506
Just a minute.

09:56.545 --> 09:58.012
Fuc...

09:58.047 --> 09:59.639
Hey, hey.

10:00.482 --> 10:01.676
Let me in.

10:03.285 --> 10:05.981
What are you doing?
I'm taking a piss, asshole!

10:06.021 --> 10:07.147
- Yeah.
- Yo!

10:07.189 --> 10:09.657
I'm not joining
the mile-high club with you.

10:09.692 --> 10:11.683
What about the really high club?

10:13.362 --> 10:15.023
- Are you retarded?
- No.

10:15.064 --> 10:16.964
You brought weed
on the fucking airplane?

10:16.999 --> 10:19.229
- Yep.
- What the fuck?

10:19.268 --> 10:21.236
Wait a second. You were giving
that security guard shit.

10:21.270 --> 10:23.261
Yeah. How else was I
supposed to get past him?

10:23.305 --> 10:26.069
By not bringing drugs on an airplane?

10:27.076 --> 10:29.977
- Look... What are you doing? What is this?
- You'll see.

10:38.520 --> 10:43.719
Harold Lee, I would like to introduce you
to an invention of mine.

10:43.759 --> 10:45.886
Meet the smokeless bong.

10:45.928 --> 10:48.829
- You made this?
- You know, I did.

10:48.864 --> 10:49.990
When you were slaving away at work...

10:50.032 --> 10:52.660
I was actually being
a productive member of society.

10:52.701 --> 10:56.865
- Yeah, that's really productive.
- Let me show you how it works.

10:56.905 --> 10:59.465
So you take a little weed...

11:00.476 --> 11:03.411
put it in the bowl right here and
light it just like a normal bong, OK?

11:03.445 --> 11:05.276
Now here's the truly genius part.

11:05.314 --> 11:10.911
Inside this mechanism, I have
actually made a little tiny, tiny fan...

11:10.953 --> 11:13.683
and some disinfectant powder, OK,
it works sort of like a deodorizer...

11:13.722 --> 11:16.520
so that anything it expunges
smells like Lysol.

11:16.558 --> 11:18.185
- Put it away.
- No, dude.

11:18.227 --> 11:20.218
Can you not wait
till we get to Amsterdam?

11:20.262 --> 11:22.924
It's the weed capital of the world!

11:24.400 --> 11:25.992
- No.
- Put the bong away!

11:26.035 --> 11:27.866
- Take the inaugural hit, dude.
- No!

11:27.903 --> 11:28.995
Come on, man.

11:29.038 --> 11:32.235
- Then I'm gonna do it.
- Put it away. Put the frickin' bong away.

11:36.145 --> 11:39.080
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Turb...

11:45.988 --> 11:48.388
Terrorist!

11:50.159 --> 11:51.421
Roldy?

11:51.460 --> 11:53.792
- What the fuck is that thing in his hands?
- No, ma'am, not a terrorist.

11:53.829 --> 11:56.696
- He's just an idiot.
- This is just a bong.

11:56.732 --> 11:59.200
He said he got a bomb!

12:01.103 --> 12:04.129
No, people,
it's a water pipe for tobacco.

12:04.173 --> 12:06.539
No, no, no, it's not a bomb. It's just a bong.

12:15.050 --> 12:17.575
Poison gas!

12:22.925 --> 12:25.985
It's marijuana! Marijuana!

12:26.028 --> 12:29.225
You picked the wrong plane,
you terrorist fuck!

12:29.264 --> 12:31.232
Hey!
Hey, what are you doing?

12:32.768 --> 12:35.669
There are three air marshals
on board. Three!

12:35.704 --> 12:39.299
We are not terrorists!
Sir, that's a bong, not a bomb.

12:39.341 --> 12:41.138
Shut up!

12:42.144 --> 12:43.338
I got this one!

12:43.378 --> 12:44.709
- Roldy?
- Please don't!

12:44.746 --> 12:47.681
I am in a great amount of pain!

12:47.716 --> 12:51.914
Everybody relax. Just calm down.
Everything is under control.

12:51.954 --> 12:56.220
Tell 'em to turn the plane around. These
two assholes are goin' back to the U.S.

13:20.149 --> 13:23.744
Secretary Fox. Glad you could make it.

13:23.785 --> 13:26.777
Think I'd miss a terrorist attack
of this magnitude?

13:26.822 --> 13:29.052
Not a fuckin' chance.

13:33.162 --> 13:35.187
Who are these people?

13:35.230 --> 13:38.529
Representatives
of the different intelligence agencies.

13:38.567 --> 13:41.058
I assume
Secretary Whitmore's coming?

13:41.103 --> 13:45.802
Negative. He's on an ice fishing trip
in Glacier Bay.

13:45.841 --> 13:47.433
I'm in charge while he's gone.

13:47.476 --> 13:49.910
Well, shouldn't he be alerted?

13:49.945 --> 13:55.247
Isn't this issue of more importance
than an ice fishing trip?

14:00.489 --> 14:02.514
Who are you again?

14:02.558 --> 14:04.753
Dr. John Beecher,
Vice Chairman of the NSA.

14:04.793 --> 14:08.160
Yeah, well, listen, Dr... Dipshit.

14:08.964 --> 14:11.524
You've obviously
never been ice fishing before.

14:12.968 --> 14:17.166
- No, I haven't.
- Yeah, well, it's fucking exhilarating.

14:17.206 --> 14:20.903
The last thing anyone would want
while fishing for pike is to be interrupted.

14:20.943 --> 14:22.740
Now back off...

14:23.745 --> 14:26.111
and let me do my job.

14:38.527 --> 14:40.518
What's up with the guy
with the weird eyes?

14:40.562 --> 14:43.156
He handicapped or something?

14:43.198 --> 14:45.189
We believe he's of Korean descent.

14:48.804 --> 14:50.669
My God.

14:52.307 --> 14:55.799
North Korea and al-Qaeda
workin' together.

14:55.844 --> 14:57.607
This is bigger than I thought.

14:58.180 --> 15:00.148
You couldn't wait?

15:00.182 --> 15:02.878
You couldn't fucking wait?

15:02.918 --> 15:05.580
We were about to have
all the legal weed we wanted.

15:05.621 --> 15:08.886
You know, in Amsterdam,
where we were going!

15:27.009 --> 15:28.670
Thought you could
get away with this, huh?

15:32.681 --> 15:39.712
You thought that after 9/11
our national security was a joke, huh?

15:40.589 --> 15:42.181
Well...

15:45.127 --> 15:46.287
guess what?

15:47.262 --> 15:48.524
What?

15:50.365 --> 15:52.959
We knew you fuckers would be back.

15:53.001 --> 15:54.161
- Holy shit!
- But we're Americans, man.

15:54.202 --> 15:56.966
- We love America. We love America!
- Very much.

15:57.005 --> 15:58.734
That's a convenient thing to say...

15:58.774 --> 16:01.743
after you try and blow up a plane
filled with Americans!

16:01.777 --> 16:03.005
- No.
- No, we didn't do...

16:03.045 --> 16:05.570
No, you see, you have the wrong idea.

16:05.614 --> 16:07.445
My idiot friend here
brought marijuana...

16:07.482 --> 16:08.972
- on the plane.
- Yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey.

16:09.017 --> 16:13.078
Zip it, Hello Kitty. OK? I know
your operation's funded through drugs.

16:13.121 --> 16:14.986
No. This is typical
government bullshit, sir. l...

16:15.023 --> 16:16.786
- Hey, hey, hey. Shut up. Shut up!
- l...

16:16.825 --> 16:20.693
- No, I'm trying to explain it! Harold!
- Shut up, shut up, shut up! Shut up!

16:22.998 --> 16:25.159
Do we have the right
to make a phone call?

16:26.335 --> 16:27.962
Yeah. Yeah!

16:28.003 --> 16:31.370
I'm sorry. You want rights now.

16:31.406 --> 16:34.068
You want freedoms right now.

16:34.109 --> 16:35.974
Is it time? Is it freedom o'clock?

16:39.414 --> 16:41.507
- Guess what.
- What?

16:42.384 --> 16:47.481
Where you guys are going,
they have never even heard of rights.

16:48.690 --> 16:50.658
Well, where are we going?

16:57.933 --> 17:01.767
We're innocent men!
We're innocent men!

17:02.637 --> 17:04.605
I'm an innocent man.

17:05.173 --> 17:07.607
I donate blood.

17:07.642 --> 17:10.542
And toys for tots.

17:14.316 --> 17:16.944
And now I'm in Guantánamo Bay.

17:16.984 --> 17:19.078
See why I'm against paying taxes?

17:19.121 --> 17:20.884
Hey! Hey.

17:21.723 --> 17:23.054
Fuck you!

17:23.090 --> 17:25.059
Dude, calm down, OK?

17:25.093 --> 17:28.756
Look on the bright side.
There's a sink. There's a toilet.

17:28.797 --> 17:30.765
The pillow actually
looks pretty comfortable.

17:33.635 --> 17:36.297
OK. You don't speak to me, ever.

17:36.338 --> 17:37.600
- Ever.
- OK.

17:37.639 --> 17:39.869
- No! Shut up!
- OK.

17:42.444 --> 17:43.775
So what are you guys in here for?

17:45.881 --> 17:51.114
For giving the United States
a taste of their own medicine.

17:52.087 --> 17:56.217
- You guys are real terrorists?
- Some call us terrorists.

17:56.258 --> 17:58.590
Others call us heroes.

17:58.627 --> 18:02.222
Screw that. You think you guys
are heroes for killing innocent people?

18:02.264 --> 18:04.391
It's 'cause of assholes like you
that we're even in this fucking place...

18:04.433 --> 18:05.832
you fucking cowards!

18:05.867 --> 18:08.700
Well, maybe if the people in your country
stopped eating donuts...

18:08.737 --> 18:11.535
and started realizing what your
government is doing to the world...

18:11.573 --> 18:13.939
assholes like us wouldn't exist.

18:13.975 --> 18:16.842
- Fuck you! Donuts are awesome!
- They're delicious.

18:16.878 --> 18:18.175
You like donuts?

18:18.213 --> 18:21.444
Well, wait till you see
what they make you eat in here.

18:21.483 --> 18:23.644
- Yeah?
- What do they make you eat in here?

18:23.685 --> 18:25.277
l...

18:25.320 --> 18:28.016
Ever hear of a cockmeat sandwich?

18:28.857 --> 18:30.415
What's a cockmeat sandwich?

18:31.927 --> 18:33.121
You're about to find out.

18:35.764 --> 18:38.426
Right about now. Sucker.

18:41.670 --> 18:45.868
All right, cockmeat sandwich time.
You know the drill.

18:45.907 --> 18:48.603
What about them? They just got here!

18:51.513 --> 18:53.037
Big Bob's taking care of them.

18:53.081 --> 18:55.549
- Big Bob.
- Big Bob?

18:55.584 --> 18:57.950
I hope you like donuts.

18:57.986 --> 19:01.046
Let's go to work. Hey, listen, guys, enjoy.

19:03.425 --> 19:04.687
Holy shit.

19:04.726 --> 19:06.921
Oh, yeah, that's it.

19:07.896 --> 19:11.491
- This is not good.
- No, Kumar, it is not good.

19:11.533 --> 19:13.797
- I've never had to suck a dick before.
- Me neither.

19:13.835 --> 19:15.826
I bet it sucks dick.

19:17.772 --> 19:19.467
Shit, dude.

19:19.508 --> 19:21.476
Please don't let it be Big Bob.
Please don't let it be Big Bob.

19:21.510 --> 19:24.638
Please don't let it be Big Bob.
Come on.

19:24.679 --> 19:27.375
Please don't let it be Big Bob.
Please don't let it be Big Bob.

19:27.415 --> 19:28.746
Please don't let it be Big Bob.

19:28.783 --> 19:30.648
- Please don't let it be Big Bob.
- I'm Big Bob.

19:30.685 --> 19:33.654
- Fuck.
- Yes, you are.

19:35.123 --> 19:37.148
You boys ready
for your cockmeat sandwich?

19:39.327 --> 19:40.316
No?

19:40.362 --> 19:42.262
Well, you better get hungry real fast...

19:42.297 --> 19:46.097
'cause I got a whole lot of sandwich
waitin' for ya.

19:47.035 --> 19:48.696
Holy shit!

19:48.737 --> 19:51.934
- All right, let's get goin'.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on, Big Bob...

19:51.973 --> 19:55.500
I got to ask you a question
before this all goes down.

19:55.544 --> 19:58.445
- All the guards in Guantánamo are gay?
- Fuck, no!

19:58.480 --> 20:01.074
Ain't nothing gay
about getting your dick sucked!

20:01.116 --> 20:03.949
You're the ones that's gay
for suckin' my dick!

20:03.985 --> 20:05.646
- What?
- In fact...

20:05.687 --> 20:09.214
creeps me out
just bein' around you fags.

20:09.257 --> 20:10.690
- But...
- All right.

20:10.725 --> 20:12.920
- Wait...
- Get down on your knees...

20:12.961 --> 20:14.656
- and open your mouths.
- Please, Big Bob.

20:14.696 --> 20:15.890
Why don't you just
kick our ass instead?

20:15.931 --> 20:18.126
- Get on your fucking knees!
- All right. All right.

20:18.166 --> 20:21.932
- All right, all right, all right, all right.
- You go first, dude.

20:21.970 --> 20:24.029
Hope you boys like extra mayo.

20:24.072 --> 20:26.802
- Jesus, Kumar.
- Oh, I hate you so much!

20:26.841 --> 20:28.274
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

20:28.310 --> 20:30.744
God, his dick smells like shit, dude.

20:35.483 --> 20:37.280
Holy shit!

20:38.587 --> 20:42.887
- What the hell happened?
- That terrorist fuck bit my dick!

20:47.996 --> 20:49.759
- Come on.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait a second!

20:49.798 --> 20:52.164
Should we?
What if they kill us out there?

20:52.200 --> 20:53.861
They're gonna fucking make us
suck their dicks if we don't.

20:53.902 --> 20:55.301
We're gonna die in here. Come on.

20:58.540 --> 21:00.633
- Fuck. Fuck.
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

21:01.209 --> 21:03.177
- Shit. Shit.
- Fuck. Fuck.

21:03.211 --> 21:05.270
- Shit. Shit.
- Fuck. Fuck.

21:05.313 --> 21:07.281
- Oh, shit! Get out!
- Fuck!

21:07.315 --> 21:09.579
Oh, shit. Shit.

21:09.618 --> 21:11.108
Door, door.

21:16.358 --> 21:17.450
Look, look, look.

21:17.492 --> 21:19.119
What the fuck is he doing?

21:31.239 --> 21:34.402
We've got to go
now, now, now, now, now!

21:36.878 --> 21:38.846
It smells like burnt asshole.

21:42.350 --> 21:44.318
I can't fucking believe this.

21:46.388 --> 21:47.377
Fuck!

21:51.092 --> 21:52.559
My wrist is swelling, man!

21:52.594 --> 21:54.562
- Shut up.
- We're gonna die in a jungle!

21:54.596 --> 21:56.154
- Shut up!
- Fuck!

21:56.197 --> 22:00.031
Watch out for cheetahs!
This is cheetah turf.

22:01.269 --> 22:03.635
- What?
- OK. Fuck.

22:03.672 --> 22:05.162
We hit ocean.
What do we do now?

22:06.474 --> 22:08.704
All right.

22:08.743 --> 22:10.233
Hey, look, look!

22:14.449 --> 22:15.711
Excuse me.

22:17.052 --> 22:18.679
You guys going to America?

22:18.720 --> 22:19.948
<i>Sí, vamos.</i>

22:19.988 --> 22:21.888
Yes, we're going.

22:21.923 --> 22:23.390
Thank you.

22:23.425 --> 22:24.483
<i>- Es mío.</i>
<i>- Vamos, vamos.</i>

22:24.559 --> 22:25.583
I'm telling you, Jorge...

22:25.627 --> 22:27.720
the first thing you have to do
when you get to America...

22:27.762 --> 22:30.663
buy a device called TiVo, OK?

22:30.699 --> 22:33.065
Freedom means nothing if you're
a slave to regular programming...

22:33.101 --> 22:34.534
I promise you that.

22:34.569 --> 22:36.537
And now, how about you focus?

22:36.571 --> 22:38.835
We gotta figure out what to do
when we get to the States.

22:38.873 --> 22:41.706
We don't have wallets. We don't
have any ID. We've got nothing.

22:41.743 --> 22:45.440
Well, I figure we're gonna land
somewhere around Miami, right?

22:45.480 --> 22:47.641
There's only one guy we know
who lives down there.

22:47.682 --> 22:50.116
- Who do we know that... Raza.
- Yeah.

22:50.151 --> 22:52.244
We gotta go see Raza.

22:53.254 --> 22:55.051
- <i>Adiós.</i>
<i>- Hasta luego.</i>

22:55.090 --> 22:58.025
- Thanks again.
- What nice people.

22:58.059 --> 23:00.425
Man, South Florida here we are.

23:00.462 --> 23:02.930
OK. So, now how do we get to Raza's?

23:02.964 --> 23:04.898
The professional way.
We walk. Let's go.

23:04.933 --> 23:06.400
- Walk?
- Yeah.

23:06.434 --> 23:08.425
So I guess Raza's...

23:08.470 --> 23:10.631
- We'll find it, we'll find it.
...thataway. Yeah.

23:10.672 --> 23:12.037
# <i>Dale así, papi</i> #

23:12.107 --> 23:13.904
# <i>Tócame</i> #

23:14.876 --> 23:16.639

23:16.678 --> 23:18.407

23:22.083 --> 23:23.175
# <i>Ay</i> #

23:23.218 --> 23:27.120
- Wow, Raza's place is pretty sweet.
- Kinda ghetto for Miami.

23:27.155 --> 23:28.213
# <i>Para abajo</i> #

23:28.256 --> 23:30.656
# <i>Toca, toca, toca, toca, toca</i> #

23:34.162 --> 23:35.493
- Hi.
- Hey.

23:38.533 --> 23:41.024
Y'all aren't here to complain
about the noise, are you?

23:41.870 --> 23:45.169
No. We're not...
here to complain about the noise.

23:45.206 --> 23:47.731
We're...

23:50.345 --> 23:51.505
We are here to see...

23:51.546 --> 23:53.844
- What is his name? We're here...
- Vagina.

23:53.882 --> 23:57.249
No, we're here to see Raza.

23:57.285 --> 23:59.515
OK. Follow me.

23:59.554 --> 24:01.112
Thank you, ma'am.

24:01.756 --> 24:04.623
We'll follow... you, I guess.

24:04.659 --> 24:06.456
# Ba-dunk, ba-dunk, ba-dunk #

24:06.494 --> 24:08.359
# She got it, she got it #

24:08.396 --> 24:09.863
# Ba-dunk, ba-dunk, ba-dunk #

24:09.898 --> 24:11.889
# She said, "Boy, go ahead" #

24:11.933 --> 24:13.924
# As long as I don't touch it #

24:13.968 --> 24:17.665
# I said, "Now, why the hell
would I wanna interrupt it?" #

24:17.705 --> 24:18.694
Hey.

24:19.474 --> 24:21.635
- Very patriotic of you.
- Thank you.

24:22.811 --> 24:24.779
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

24:26.981 --> 24:29.245
- Hey, Raza!
- What?

24:29.284 --> 24:30.512
What's up?

24:30.552 --> 24:31.883
- Kumar and Roldy?
- What's up, man?

24:31.920 --> 24:34.548
I haven't seen you guys
since graduation.

24:34.589 --> 24:36.147
What are you guys doing here?

24:36.191 --> 24:38.853
Wait, what's up
with the orange jumpsuits?

24:38.893 --> 24:40.360
- Hey, no, no, question number one...
- It's kind of a long story. l...

24:40.395 --> 24:42.056
...what's up with this party?
- What do you mean?

24:42.096 --> 24:44.564
There's exposed vagina
all over your house.

24:44.599 --> 24:46.965
Yeah. That was my idea.

24:47.001 --> 24:50.664
I don't know about you guys,
I'm sick of all the hype over topless.

24:50.705 --> 24:53.105
Really? I always liked toplessness.
That's...

24:53.141 --> 24:54.130
- That's just me.
- Yeah? Well, I'm starting...

24:54.175 --> 24:57.770
the bottomless trend.
Hence, the bottomless party.

24:57.812 --> 24:58.801
So what are you guys doing
in South Beach?

24:58.847 --> 25:00.940
How about you answer that question?
I'm gonna go check this out.

25:00.982 --> 25:02.711
- Where are you going?
- Bang bang, buddy.

25:02.750 --> 25:05.082
Listen. I'm really sorry
to bother you with this.

25:05.119 --> 25:06.780
- You all right?
- Not really.

25:09.557 --> 25:12.890
They were locked up for less than
an hour, and they already escaped?

25:12.927 --> 25:15.760
Damn it. Make sure the press
doesn't get wind of this.

25:15.797 --> 25:17.765
Don't need the public thinking
we're some two-bit operation.

25:17.799 --> 25:18.788
Got it, sir.

25:18.833 --> 25:20.698
It must have been either al-Qaeda
or North Korea who broke 'em up.

25:20.735 --> 25:22.327
Find out if they have
any relatives in the country.

25:22.370 --> 25:25.396
You probably should have
done that in the first place.

25:30.378 --> 25:35.247
Do you have a problem with the way
I'm running the show, Beecher?

25:35.283 --> 25:37.615
I'm just saying that...

25:37.652 --> 25:41.486
I've looked through the files
on Harold Lee and Kumar Patel.

25:41.522 --> 25:43.080
They were both born
and raised in New Jersey.

25:43.124 --> 25:44.955
Other than a couple of traffic tickets,
they're clean.

25:44.993 --> 25:47.325
Right. That's why
they just broke out of prison.

25:47.362 --> 25:50.229
But they... It's not even clear that they
should have been there in the first place.

25:50.265 --> 25:52.256
Shut your...

25:59.240 --> 26:01.105
You see this cute, little white girl,
Beecher?

26:01.142 --> 26:02.473
Yeah.

26:02.510 --> 26:06.446
Do you want her to get raped
and murdered?

26:07.849 --> 26:08.838
Of course not.

26:08.883 --> 26:11.613
You sure? 'Cause this is America.

26:12.186 --> 26:15.883
- Do you want to rape America?
- No.

26:15.924 --> 26:19.360
Then stop fucking with me.

26:23.264 --> 26:24.731
This is serious.

26:25.767 --> 26:27.667
She's adorable.

26:29.837 --> 26:31.566
So you guys are fucking fugitives?

26:31.606 --> 26:33.836
It's just it's Kumar's fault.

26:33.875 --> 26:35.775
If we get out of this...

26:35.810 --> 26:39.177
the chances of us remaining friends
is highly...

26:39.213 --> 26:40.407
highly... boobies. Yeah.

26:40.448 --> 26:42.473
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

26:42.517 --> 26:44.985
Put that back on. And keep it on.

26:45.019 --> 26:47.146
- Sorry.
- Fuckin' party do you think this is?

26:47.188 --> 26:49.281
Yo. What are you guys talking about?

26:49.324 --> 26:51.349
Roldy was just letting me
in on your situation.

26:51.392 --> 26:53.326
- Yeah?
- Thanks for getting me involved.

26:53.361 --> 26:55.295
What about that fuckin' time
we had to cover for you...

26:55.330 --> 26:57.093
lie to your ex-girlfriend
about how you got crabs?

26:57.131 --> 26:58.291
You owe us, man.

26:58.333 --> 26:59.630
- Yeah, that's right.
- What?

26:59.667 --> 27:01.828
- OK, that was a long time ago.
- I love crabs.

27:01.869 --> 27:03.666
Speaking of ex-girlfriends...

27:03.705 --> 27:05.434
isn't yours getting married
or something?

27:05.473 --> 27:07.407
How does everybody know about this
except for me?

27:07.442 --> 27:08.875
Wait.

27:09.911 --> 27:12.038
Colton! Colton Graham can help us out.

27:12.080 --> 27:13.445
- No! Fuck that!
- Yes!

27:13.481 --> 27:16.177
No doubt. If anyone could
clear your names, it's him.

27:16.217 --> 27:17.912
No, I'm sorry.
That dickweed is not helping us.

27:17.952 --> 27:19.886
Wait a second.
Do you have his contact info?

27:19.921 --> 27:23.948
Not anymore. But the wedding is
at his family's estate in Hewitt, Texas.

27:24.525 --> 27:26.516
But you don't want to bother them
when they're doing their whole...

27:26.561 --> 27:28.586
wedding thing, right?

27:30.498 --> 27:33.433
You know,
that actually might be our only hope.

27:33.468 --> 27:36.733
Fuck! How do we get there? We can't
go to the airport. They're looking for us.

27:36.771 --> 27:38.363
- I'll loan you one of my cars.
- Really?

27:38.406 --> 27:42.137
But first... y'all got to get
in the spirit of the party.

27:42.176 --> 27:45.373
- What do you mean, spirit of...
- What do you think I mean?

27:46.180 --> 27:49.274
- What about you?
- Me? I've been in the spirit.

27:50.585 --> 27:52.348
- Oh, God!
- Oh, my God, dude!

27:52.387 --> 27:53.615
Oh, my God!

27:53.654 --> 27:55.485
- Love your dickdo, Raza.
- Yeah. Drink it in.

27:55.523 --> 27:58.720
- What the fuck?
- That looks like Osama bin Laden's beard.

27:58.760 --> 28:00.990
I know, right? All right, boys.

28:01.029 --> 28:02.792
Your turn. Let 'em dangle.

28:04.298 --> 28:06.266
- Let's just do it.
- Bring it.

28:06.300 --> 28:08.427
Count of three?

28:08.469 --> 28:10.164
One.

28:10.204 --> 28:11.694
Two, three.

28:14.042 --> 28:16.306
Your cocks are awesome, man!

28:16.344 --> 28:18.676
That's not even necessary.

28:18.713 --> 28:20.840
- Would you please...
- Oh, my dick!

28:20.882 --> 28:23.077
# My dick cost a late-night fee #

28:23.117 --> 28:25.244
# Your dick got the HIV #

28:25.286 --> 28:27.846
# My dick plays on
the double feature screen #

28:27.889 --> 28:30.187
# Your dick went straight to DVD #

28:30.224 --> 28:32.784
# My dick bigger than a bridge #

28:32.827 --> 28:35.125
# Your dick look like a little kid's #

28:35.163 --> 28:38.064
# My dick large like the Chargers,
the whole team #

28:38.099 --> 28:39.862
# Your shit look like you 14 #

28:39.901 --> 28:42.335
# My dick locked in a cage, right #

28:42.370 --> 28:44.497
# Your dick suffer from stage fright #

28:44.539 --> 28:47.167
# My dick so hot it's stolen #

28:47.208 --> 28:49.699
# Your dick look like Gary Coleman #

28:49.744 --> 28:52.235
# My dick pink and big #

28:52.280 --> 28:56.478
- This car is frickin' sweet.
- Yeah, yeah, it's sweet.

28:56.517 --> 28:58.041
'Cause we're fugitives.

28:58.086 --> 29:01.078
Driving a yellow convertible
with the top down, dressed like assholes!

29:01.122 --> 29:04.114
Yo. Yo. Yo, look, he has
one of these things.

29:04.158 --> 29:06.149
- Would you put that down?
- No, you can hook up to the Internet.

29:06.194 --> 29:08.856
You can play <i>Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!</i>
on it. King Hippo's going down.

29:08.896 --> 29:10.761
Put that away. Put that away.

29:10.798 --> 29:14.598
I can't believe you can even think about
playing games at a time like this, man.

29:14.635 --> 29:17.263
You realize what would happen
if our parents found out about this?

29:17.839 --> 29:20.672
You have sent our sons
to Guantánamo Bay?

29:20.708 --> 29:22.869
This is an outrage!

29:23.578 --> 29:26.877
You Arabs think you can just mix in
with our peaceful society...

29:26.914 --> 29:28.074
and we're not gonna find you, huh?

29:28.116 --> 29:30.550
I am not Arab! I am Indian!

29:30.585 --> 29:35.079
Look, Chief. I'm not here to argue
seblantics with you, OK?

29:35.123 --> 29:37.182
I'm here to save lives.

29:37.225 --> 29:40.319
Ask the Lees what they know
about their son's terrorist activity.

29:50.071 --> 29:53.939
Look, we have been American citizens
for over 40 years.

29:53.975 --> 29:57.467
Now, frankly, I find this very offensive.

29:59.614 --> 30:04.017
They're using some sort of dialect
I've never heard before.

30:04.051 --> 30:07.214
But I'm pretty sure he said something
about going on the offensive.

30:09.090 --> 30:12.355
Tell them we know
what their son is up to...

30:12.393 --> 30:15.260
and if they don't cooperate,
he could be sentenced to death.

30:16.864 --> 30:19.059
Hit 'em. Yeah.

30:23.037 --> 30:24.971
We know what he said!

30:25.006 --> 30:27.998
Sir, Harold and Kumar are good boys.

30:31.679 --> 30:33.909
I'm a pretty good translator.

30:33.948 --> 30:35.711
It's total gibberish.

30:37.485 --> 30:38.975
They may be trying to stonewall us.

30:39.854 --> 30:42.186
Are you sure you speak Korean, Jack?

30:42.223 --> 30:43.212
You speak Korean?

30:43.257 --> 30:45.054
You're not fucking with Daddy, are you?

30:45.092 --> 30:49.153
Do you have a masters
in romantic Korean literature?

30:49.197 --> 30:51.222
Because I do...

30:51.265 --> 30:52.823
and I'm offended.

30:54.035 --> 30:55.024
Good enough for me.

30:55.970 --> 30:58.097
Look, excuse me...

30:58.139 --> 31:00.505
we're not looking to hurt your sons...

31:00.541 --> 31:02.941
we just wanna know where they are.

31:02.977 --> 31:05.172
Do you know if they know anybody
in Florida?

31:06.347 --> 31:09.680
Their friend Raza Syed lives in Miami.

31:10.284 --> 31:11.751
But why would they be there?

31:11.786 --> 31:13.549
He's supposed to be in medical school.

31:13.588 --> 31:18.753
They are supposed to be in prison!
That is where terrorists belong!

31:21.395 --> 31:23.955
These fuckers are goin' down.

31:23.998 --> 31:25.898
Dead. Or alive.

31:25.933 --> 31:29.232
Tell them that in your fake
ching-chong language.

31:31.372 --> 31:32.737
Shut up! You're an idiot.

31:34.308 --> 31:37.368
I don't know what you're saying, buddy...

31:37.411 --> 31:38.400
but fuck you.

31:38.446 --> 31:39.538
- Fuck me?
- Will you let him talk to you like that?

31:39.580 --> 31:41.775
- Listen, no, sit down.
- Fuck me?

31:49.757 --> 31:51.952
Hey, look, man, we're in Alabama.

31:53.127 --> 31:55.391
Wow, we actually get a first-hand look
at the South, huh?

31:55.429 --> 31:58.990
Hey, this wasn't supposed to be a trip
through the South, OK?

31:59.033 --> 32:01.524
This was supposed to be
the most romantic week of my life.

32:01.569 --> 32:04.265
Remember that? Before you
fucked it up? You remember that?

32:04.305 --> 32:06.500
Just chill, OK?
We'll be out of this situation.

32:06.540 --> 32:09.737
You'll be up in Maria's guts
in no time, all right?

32:09.777 --> 32:13.736
Hey. She's not some skank, man.

32:13.781 --> 32:17.979
I've never felt this way
about anyone before, really.

32:19.287 --> 32:21.619
What the fuck?
Why am I talking to you about this?

32:21.656 --> 32:23.954
It's not like you would understand, so...

32:34.935 --> 32:37.096
# I want to be happy #

32:38.372 --> 32:40.932
# I want to be happy, just like... #

32:40.975 --> 32:45.036
Excuse me, please.
Will you turn that off? This is a library.

32:47.615 --> 32:49.446
What a fucking chode.

32:49.483 --> 32:51.474
Thank you, come again!

32:57.825 --> 32:59.952
- What the fuck?!
- Oh, my God.

32:59.994 --> 33:01.586
You know, the whole reason
people come to the stacks...

33:01.629 --> 33:04.154
is for some peace and...

33:05.166 --> 33:06.724
quiet.

33:06.767 --> 33:09.600
Look, I know, I'm sorry. I hate it
when people disturb me here too.

33:09.637 --> 33:12.765
It's just this fucking calculus final
is killing me.

33:14.308 --> 33:18.210
- Do you mind if I take a look?
- No.

33:18.245 --> 33:22.375
- You're actually very close. May I?
- Yeah.

33:22.416 --> 33:24.213
Excuse me.

33:28.789 --> 33:30.984
I touched your breast.

33:31.025 --> 33:33.493
- It's OK.
- Sorry.

33:36.130 --> 33:38.098
You just go...

33:40.134 --> 33:43.035
Wow. You're good at this.

33:43.070 --> 33:44.332
Thanks.

33:44.372 --> 33:47.068
What did you, like, take calculus
in high school or something?

33:47.108 --> 33:50.100
Actually, my dad taught it to me
in sixth grade.

33:50.144 --> 33:52.669
What, are you like Doogie Howser?

33:52.713 --> 33:55.944
No. Although that would be incredible.
He's my hero.

33:55.983 --> 33:58.474
I love that show.

33:59.954 --> 34:01.114
What are you working on there?

34:01.155 --> 34:04.056
This is just a poem
for my creative writing class.

34:04.091 --> 34:06.423
It's like...

34:06.460 --> 34:08.257
- <i>"The Square Root Of Three"?</i>
- No, no, I'm sorry...

34:08.295 --> 34:11.092
- "A poem of love by Kumar Patel."
- I need this.

34:11.132 --> 34:13.190
- Hey, let me read it.
- No, no.

34:13.234 --> 34:15.464
- Why?
- Because it's lame.

34:15.503 --> 34:16.527
Then read it to me.

34:16.570 --> 34:20.563
There's no way I'm letting you see me
in that light. Good luck with your calculus.

34:21.609 --> 34:25.978
Come on, don't be embarrassed. You
know, a lot of girls find intelligence sexy.

34:26.013 --> 34:29.005
Look, I'm not even gonna be
showing this to my professor, all right?

34:29.049 --> 34:31.244
That's why I'm so stressed out
right now.

34:31.284 --> 34:33.514
Stressed out, huh?

34:33.554 --> 34:35.454
Come with me.

34:36.657 --> 34:38.989
...going?
- Come on.

34:41.161 --> 34:42.754
What?

34:48.101 --> 34:52.094
You're smoking drugs in the library?
What if somebody catches us?

34:52.739 --> 34:55.368
Don't worry. It'll help you relax.

34:55.409 --> 34:57.877
Oh, boy.

34:57.912 --> 35:00.380
It's illegal.

35:00.414 --> 35:05.147
# I want your fish right by me #

35:05.753 --> 35:08.654
# That's how it has to be #

35:08.689 --> 35:09.883
Here.

35:09.924 --> 35:12.518
#... copacetic if you let it so set up #

35:12.560 --> 35:16.189
# And keep the downstream down
and the upstream up #

35:18.065 --> 35:19.794
This is poison.

35:19.834 --> 35:21.734
# My stoney, my baby #

35:21.769 --> 35:23.430
Let me help you.

35:23.471 --> 35:26.167
# Funk the groovin' thang whistlin' #

35:26.207 --> 35:27.834
# As I rip my rhymes #

35:27.875 --> 35:30.435
# Time and time again struttin'
and in the summertime #

35:30.478 --> 35:32.673
# So screw it,
strip down and be generic #

35:32.713 --> 35:35.147
# Strip down and be a passenger
Strip down and be a messenger #

35:35.182 --> 35:37.810
# In askin' why I'm born
I come up blank in the winter #

35:37.852 --> 35:40.480
# In askin' why I'm born
I come up on when I'm on her #

35:40.521 --> 35:42.716
- # It's time to find the kind #
- # My summer, his summer #

35:42.756 --> 35:44.348
I'm Kumar.

35:45.993 --> 35:47.290
Vanessa.

35:47.328 --> 35:49.694
You're still not reading that poem.

35:49.730 --> 35:53.689
# And then I kiss my stoney baby #

35:53.734 --> 35:56.032
# My stoney, my stoney #

35:56.070 --> 35:58.368
# My stoney baby #

35:58.405 --> 36:00.965
# My stoney #

36:01.008 --> 36:03.033
# My stoney baby #

36:03.711 --> 36:04.973
Kumar.

36:06.013 --> 36:09.141
# My stoney baby #

36:09.183 --> 36:10.172
Kumar.

36:10.217 --> 36:12.048
Kumar. Kumar.

36:12.219 --> 36:14.450
- Kumar.
- Yeah.

36:14.459 --> 36:17.720
What's going on? We're in Birmingham,
Alabama. Are we supposed to be here?

36:17.758 --> 36:19.919
What's going on?

36:19.960 --> 36:22.087
- Why did you bring us here, dude?
- What do you mean, why did l...

36:22.129 --> 36:25.394
You were supposed to be following the
directions, asshole. What do you mean?

36:25.432 --> 36:28.026
There's got to be like a highway
or something, right?

36:28.068 --> 36:30.366
Yeah, there's got to be a highway.

36:31.305 --> 36:33.170
What's going on up there?

36:33.207 --> 36:34.572
# Squad up #

36:34.608 --> 36:36.235
# My niggas #

36:36.277 --> 36:38.177
# I see some pussy-ass niggas,
so what the fuck... #

36:38.212 --> 36:40.680
What the hell is this?

36:40.714 --> 36:41.806
# We knock these niggas out #

36:41.849 --> 36:43.908
# I see some pussy-ass niggas,
so what the fuck you wanna do? #

36:43.951 --> 36:46.613
- I'm turning around.
- Nah, just go through, man.

36:47.421 --> 36:49.321
Dude, we're not driving
through this basketball game.

36:49.356 --> 36:51.984
You know, Roldy, I really thought
you were bigger than this.

36:52.026 --> 36:54.358
Dude, I'm not scared
'cause they're black.

36:54.395 --> 36:55.657
I'm scared because they're scary.

36:55.696 --> 36:58.062
And it's not like we got
Gregory Hines out there.

36:58.098 --> 36:59.087
They're not that scary.

37:00.834 --> 37:03.394
It's my ball!

37:03.437 --> 37:04.904
Turn around.

37:04.939 --> 37:07.908
# Rob this motherfucker,
drop his punk ass in a ditch #

37:07.942 --> 37:10.843
# Drag this pussy nigga,
slap his ass up like a bitch #

37:10.878 --> 37:12.436
# My niggas is my niggas
'cause my niggas... #

37:12.479 --> 37:14.811
- Fuck! It won't move!
- Shit, dude.

37:14.848 --> 37:16.315
# Shoot him dead between his lips #

37:16.350 --> 37:17.442
# I see some pussy... #

37:18.452 --> 37:19.976
- That's not good.
- Now there's no music, man.

37:20.020 --> 37:21.612
Shit, man.

37:21.655 --> 37:24.590
- Motherfucker!
- My Jordans, nigga!

37:24.625 --> 37:26.490
- Shit, this isn't good.
- This is not good. This is not good.

37:27.828 --> 37:30.058
No. No. No.

37:30.097 --> 37:31.621
They're coming over here.

37:32.333 --> 37:36.599
- Fucking shit. Why did you do that?
- Yeah, I hit a fire hydrant on purpose.

37:37.605 --> 37:40.005
They're getting weapons, man.

37:40.040 --> 37:41.473
All right, what do we do?
What do we do?

37:41.508 --> 37:43.806
Run, run, run. Run, run.

37:49.216 --> 37:51.980
Yo. Yo.

37:52.886 --> 37:55.787
- Where y'all going? Damn!
- We was just trying to help.

37:55.823 --> 37:59.987
Man, somebody call the police.
We need to report this.

38:14.208 --> 38:18.702
- Yeah, that's right. You like the ride?
- Fuck you, man.

38:18.746 --> 38:23.376
They abandoned it last night.
It's registered to a Raza Syed.

38:23.417 --> 38:25.908
The witnesses' description
of the driver and passenger...

38:25.953 --> 38:28.786
match that of Lee and Patel.

38:30.090 --> 38:34.151
We tried bringing in Syed last night,
but he's already left the country.

38:35.329 --> 38:38.230
Well, they know we're closing in on 'em,
that's why.

38:38.265 --> 38:40.859
OK. No, I'll give you a call. All right.

38:42.603 --> 38:44.696
No, no, no, no!

38:44.738 --> 38:46.069
- Holy shit!
- Easy, easy!

38:46.106 --> 38:47.903
- Easy.
- Easy!

38:47.941 --> 38:49.670
This is our witness.

38:49.710 --> 38:51.575
Put it down! Yo, put it down!

38:51.612 --> 38:52.738
You all know I got one!

38:52.780 --> 38:54.441
I got one too!

38:56.784 --> 39:01.016
So, you saw the fugitives, huh?

39:01.055 --> 39:03.615
Yeah. It was like
I was telling the Sheriff...

39:03.657 --> 39:07.593
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
How do I know you're telling the truth?

39:07.628 --> 39:09.493
I don't have a reason
to lie to you, man.

39:09.530 --> 39:10.895
Really?

39:10.931 --> 39:13.729
- Get up in your face, man.
- We'll see.

39:13.767 --> 39:15.598
That ain't right.

39:15.636 --> 39:17.570
Where's he going?

39:19.306 --> 39:21.001
What's going on?

39:24.745 --> 39:25.734
Hell no!

39:25.779 --> 39:28.111
Now why don't you tell me
what really happened?

39:28.148 --> 39:30.013
Is that grape soda?

39:30.050 --> 39:31.915
What the fuck, yo?

39:34.822 --> 39:37.017
- All right.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on!

39:37.057 --> 39:38.490
This is so ignorant.

39:38.525 --> 39:40.516
- Really?
- Yes.

39:40.561 --> 39:42.529
Is this ignorant?

39:42.563 --> 39:45.054
Yo, that's racist, man. That's racist.

39:45.099 --> 39:47.226
Hey, Jon, are you gonna let him do that?

39:48.001 --> 39:50.299
See if he got Kool-Aid.

39:50.337 --> 39:52.237
Almost gone, witness.

39:52.272 --> 39:54.206
Sure there's not something
you wanna tell me?

39:54.241 --> 39:56.141
I'm not stoppin' until you crack!

39:56.176 --> 39:57.268
I already told you
that they took off runnin'!

39:57.311 --> 39:58.642
All right, all right, all right.

39:58.679 --> 40:01.375
This isn't necessary!
Mr. White is telling you the truth!

40:01.415 --> 40:03.975
Yeah, and how can you be
so sure, Beecher?

40:04.017 --> 40:07.453
'Cause he doesn't have a police record.
He's an orthodontist, for Christ's sake.

40:09.523 --> 40:13.789
OK, then, Beech. How do you
propose we find the terrorists, huh?

40:14.628 --> 40:17.495
There was a Nokia 7710
taken from the console.

40:17.531 --> 40:18.793
We have its tracking numbers.

40:18.832 --> 40:21.960
Our satellites are running a trace on it,
as we speak.

40:22.002 --> 40:24.061
I'm serious about that Kool-Aid.

40:24.104 --> 40:25.332
What's going on? Where are you?

40:25.372 --> 40:26.771
Dude, that is a fucking long story.

40:26.807 --> 40:29.799
We're actually in Alabama right now,
heading to Texas.

40:31.345 --> 40:33.438
What is that sound? Are you jerking off
again? What are you doing?

40:33.480 --> 40:35.778
I'm taking a glorious pee-pee.

40:35.816 --> 40:37.875
Hey, listen, you're not gonna believe this...

40:37.918 --> 40:40.546
but the other night,
I ended up at that Asian party...

40:40.587 --> 40:43.147
and I schtupped Cindy Kim.

40:43.190 --> 40:45.158
Shut the fuck up. Are you serious?

40:45.192 --> 40:47.319
Yeah, man,
she even gave me a blumpkin.

40:47.361 --> 40:48.623
What is a blumpkin?

40:48.662 --> 40:51.756
It's when a girl gives you head while
you're sitting on the toilet takin' a shit.

40:51.799 --> 40:53.426
Really?

40:53.467 --> 40:56.027
- Hello?
- Hey. Hey! What are you doing?

40:56.069 --> 40:58.594
Hello? Come, come?

41:00.374 --> 41:01.807
Did you go?

41:01.842 --> 41:03.309
Yeah, I'm done.

41:03.343 --> 41:06.278
You said to me we were gonna
cross swords. You promised.

41:06.313 --> 41:08.110
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

41:09.149 --> 41:12.778
Are you talking on a cellphone
when the government is looking for us?

41:12.820 --> 41:15.311
Dude, it was just Goldstein.
I had something important to tell him.

41:15.355 --> 41:17.118
It's 'cause you had something...
That's good, that's OK.

41:17.157 --> 41:22.720
Nothing is more important
than finding a way to get to Texas.

41:22.763 --> 41:23.752
- Do you get it?
- Yes.

41:23.797 --> 41:28.200
We've been walking an entire day
and we have not seen a street sign.

41:28.235 --> 41:29.361
Do you get it?

41:29.403 --> 41:32.668
- Can I say...
- Again. This is... I can't.

41:32.706 --> 41:33.900
Dude, honestly...

41:33.941 --> 41:37.308
you've got to be a little more positive
about these things, all right?

41:37.344 --> 41:40.609
- Yeah?
- Positive about what? I don't...

41:40.647 --> 41:44.048
First of all, look at this beautiful
Alabama landscape, OK?

41:44.084 --> 41:47.178
You don't get shit like this in New Jersey.

41:48.021 --> 41:49.420
God, you...

41:49.489 --> 41:50.956
Hey, look, dude.

41:50.991 --> 41:52.891
It's a baby deer.

41:53.694 --> 41:57.255
- Wow. Man.
- Shit.

41:59.900 --> 42:02.733
Hey. Hey.

42:02.769 --> 42:06.227
Look how cute this deer is, dude. Not
like those asshole deer in New Jersey.

42:06.273 --> 42:07.763
I know, man.

42:07.808 --> 42:10.333
- Hey, buddy.
- Dude, Alabama's awesome.

42:10.377 --> 42:12.174
He likes you.

42:13.046 --> 42:15.674
- Oh, my God!
- No!

42:18.685 --> 42:21.620
Sorry about that. I was in my zone.

42:24.791 --> 42:28.454
What the hell are y'all doing out here
in them fancy clothes?

42:28.495 --> 42:31.020
We were on our way to Texas
and we got lost.

42:31.064 --> 42:32.554
Texas?

42:33.667 --> 42:35.828
You're a long way from Texas.

42:36.169 --> 42:37.193
No!

42:40.874 --> 42:43.536
Born in '04.

42:43.577 --> 42:45.238
Get in here.

42:48.548 --> 42:51.642
Yeah. The sun's about to go down.

42:51.685 --> 42:55.485
- Y'all need a place to stay? Ya hungry?
- Yeah, sure.

42:55.522 --> 42:57.581
You want to follow me?

42:58.492 --> 43:00.084
Come on.

43:01.094 --> 43:03.085
Maybe we shouldn't.

43:03.764 --> 43:06.494
It's already dead.
You need a hand, dude?

43:07.134 --> 43:09.728
My grandpappy
bought this land in 1902.

43:09.770 --> 43:12.238
Very nice, sir.

43:12.272 --> 43:14.502
This place is gonna suck.

43:18.578 --> 43:21.206
Honey, I'm home.

43:21.248 --> 43:22.681
# <i>É verão</i> #

43:24.451 --> 43:27.682
# <i>Atencão</i> #

43:27.721 --> 43:29.086
I'm in here.

43:32.492 --> 43:35.393
I wish you'd-a told me
you was bringing guests home.

43:35.429 --> 43:37.294
I'da straightened up in here.

43:37.331 --> 43:39.424
Fellas, this is my wife Raylene.

43:39.466 --> 43:42.094
Raylene, meet Harold and Kumar.

43:42.135 --> 43:43.602
Hello.

43:43.637 --> 43:47.903
Can't shake.
I've just got... deer head all over me.

43:47.941 --> 43:50.239
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you boys.

43:50.277 --> 43:52.768
- You just make yourselves at home.
- Thank you.

43:52.813 --> 43:54.371
Honey, something's wrong
with that DSL.

43:54.414 --> 43:57.474
Every time I go on the online,
it says, "Searching for server."

43:57.517 --> 43:59.382
You try unplugging the AirPort base?

43:59.419 --> 44:01.546
Yeah, I done did that but it didn't work.

44:01.588 --> 44:03.112
What you need to go online fors,
anyways?

44:03.156 --> 44:06.284
I was gonna get one of them
new portable satellite radios.

44:06.326 --> 44:08.954
What the fuck
you need a satellite radio for?

44:08.996 --> 44:11.294
Don't you be cussin'
when we got company over.

44:11.331 --> 44:12.457
- Guys.
- Please don't worry about us.

44:12.499 --> 44:13.796
We cuss all the time.

44:13.834 --> 44:15.165
Who do you think you is, hitting me?

44:15.202 --> 44:17.329
Who do you think bought you
that Prada bag?

44:17.371 --> 44:19.236
I told you I wanted a Gucci one.

44:19.272 --> 44:20.534
The Gucci bag cost more!

44:20.574 --> 44:22.872
Well, Jan Sapperstein's husband
sure could afford it.

44:22.909 --> 44:25.070
Here we go again with Jan Sapperstein.

44:25.112 --> 44:27.376
I don't give a rat's ass what that bitch got.

44:27.414 --> 44:28.676
You be happy with what you have.

44:28.715 --> 44:31.377
What I have is a husband
who ain't worth a turd!

44:31.418 --> 44:32.783
You wanna give me shit now?

44:32.819 --> 44:34.878
- That's right!
- After everything I let you buy!

44:34.921 --> 44:36.320
Even look at the credit card bills?

44:36.356 --> 44:39.052
...you buy?! Do you think we need
another set of golf balls?

44:39.092 --> 44:42.027
- Even worse is the credit card miles.
- Stinky, smelly, motherf...

44:42.062 --> 44:43.859
Guys, we're just gonna get out of here.

44:43.897 --> 44:47.594
Nonsense. Don't be silly.
You're our guests.

44:47.634 --> 44:50.102
You guys have got to stay for supper.

44:50.137 --> 44:51.729
- No, we couldn't. That's...
- No, thank you. We really couldn't...

44:51.772 --> 44:56.175
Of course, we're gonna
have to get high first.

45:19.399 --> 45:21.390
We're close.

45:28.608 --> 45:31.236
This is news to me.
I never knew farmers smoked weed.

45:31.278 --> 45:34.736
You ever tried farmin' not high?
It's borin' as shit.

45:34.781 --> 45:36.772
You know, this is great, guys.

45:36.817 --> 45:38.910
I kind of always,
you know, sort of assumed...

45:38.952 --> 45:42.319
that people from the South
were kinda...

45:42.355 --> 45:44.255
A bunch of dumb rednecks?

45:44.291 --> 45:46.919
- No.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's not...

45:46.960 --> 45:50.896
We do try to keep our inbred son in
the basement when we have company.

45:50.931 --> 45:53.263
Guys, I didn't mean it like that. I was just...

45:57.370 --> 45:59.235
Look at their faces!

46:04.578 --> 46:05.567
Fuck, fuck!

46:05.612 --> 46:07.273
Shit, they found us.
They found us. They found us.

46:07.314 --> 46:08.906
- What do you mean, they found you?
- Listen, I'm so sorry. I am so sorry.

46:08.949 --> 46:10.940
Are you boys in some kind of trouble?

46:10.984 --> 46:13.817
All right. This is gonna sound crazy,
but, basically...

46:13.854 --> 46:15.116
we were on a plane to Amsterdam...

46:15.155 --> 46:17.817
and we got mistaken for terrorists
and we got sent to Guantánamo Bay...

46:17.858 --> 46:19.985
and then we escaped and snuck
into America with a bunch of Cubans...

46:20.026 --> 46:21.050
and now we're trying to get to Texas...

46:21.094 --> 46:22.083
where there's a guy
who can help us out...

46:22.129 --> 46:24.029
and he's getting married
to Kumar's ex-girlfriend.

46:24.064 --> 46:25.793
Yes.

46:26.666 --> 46:29.362
OK. That's cool.

46:29.402 --> 46:31.836
- I understand that.
- You do?

46:31.872 --> 46:36.104
Like the government's never screwed
us over before. You know what?

46:36.143 --> 46:38.202
Y'all come down here and hide
in the basement. I will handle this.

46:38.245 --> 46:39.678
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, both.

46:39.713 --> 46:41.681
Thank you, thank you.

46:51.057 --> 46:53.992
OK. This isn't creepy.

46:57.531 --> 46:58.964
What the hell is that?

47:00.867 --> 47:03.563
You're walking
towards the creepy music?

47:04.137 --> 47:05.399
Ge...

47:05.438 --> 47:06.996
This song rocks, dude.

47:13.780 --> 47:14.769
Kumar.

47:21.321 --> 47:24.051
Hey, dude, there's a lighter here
with a clown on it.

47:25.525 --> 47:27.049
Jesus Christ, there's a fucking monster!

47:27.827 --> 47:28.885
God!

47:39.973 --> 47:43.136
Hey, you don't happen to have
a Baby Ruth on you, do you?

47:43.176 --> 47:45.736
No. Why do you need a Baby Ruth?

47:45.779 --> 47:48.714
That's how Chunk won over Sloth
in <i>The Goonies.</i>

47:48.748 --> 47:50.682
This thing looks like Sloth?

47:50.717 --> 47:52.878
All I saw was the creature's hand.

47:52.919 --> 47:54.614
The hand looks like Sloth?

47:54.654 --> 47:58.784
The fucking hand of an evil monster,
dude. Like fucking claws and shit.

47:58.825 --> 48:00.622
Shit.

48:00.660 --> 48:05.029
Listen, no matter what, don't let
the creature know that it's ugly, OK?

48:05.065 --> 48:07.966
The last thing that we want to do
is criticize it or make it feel different...

48:08.001 --> 48:10.731
just because it was born
with horrible deformities.

48:21.281 --> 48:24.512
Don't worry. I got rid of 'em.
It was just my neighbors.

48:24.551 --> 48:25.575
- There's a fricking Cyclops...
- No, you got...

48:25.619 --> 48:27.678
...in your basement, man!
...a fucking thing, dude!

48:27.721 --> 48:28.915
You met Cyrus.

48:28.955 --> 48:30.149
- Cyrus.
- You named it?

48:30.190 --> 48:31.418
Our son.

48:31.458 --> 48:34.393
You must have woke him up. He was
supposed to be asleep. I'm sorry.

48:34.427 --> 48:36.019
I thought you were joking...

48:36.062 --> 48:38.587
when you said you had an inbred son
who lives in your basement.

48:38.632 --> 48:40.259
Well, it ain't a joke.

48:40.300 --> 48:43.599
Raylene and I here are siblings,
and we get it on.

48:43.637 --> 48:45.935
But that don't mean
we ought to be judged.

48:45.972 --> 48:48.736
You boys must be awful tired
after what you've been through.

48:48.775 --> 48:50.208
Come with me,
I'll show you to your bed.

48:50.243 --> 48:52.268
You better go back to sleep, boy!

48:52.312 --> 48:55.304
Don't make me come down there
and whip your Cyclops ass!

48:57.617 --> 48:59.278
It's tough love.

48:59.319 --> 49:01.310
It's the best way.

49:19.105 --> 49:22.165
I don't know what I was thinking
dating that douchebag Colton.

49:22.208 --> 49:25.507
He is a douchebag.
What were you thinking?

49:25.545 --> 49:29.242
But it was agony pretending
his puny, little penis satisfied me.

49:29.282 --> 49:33.844
I bet. I bet you've been missing
the thundercock too, haven't you, baby?

49:33.887 --> 49:36.151
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

49:36.189 --> 49:37.816
Yeah, you've been missing it?

49:37.857 --> 49:38.983
How much?

49:39.025 --> 49:41.926
- A lot.
- I bet.

49:42.929 --> 49:44.726
Well...

49:44.764 --> 49:48.393
- I kind of have this fantasy.
- What is it?

49:48.435 --> 49:52.496
I thought it'd be kinda cool
to bring somebody else in bed with us.

49:53.707 --> 49:55.572
Who?

49:55.608 --> 49:57.337
Hey, baby.

50:04.050 --> 50:05.278
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

50:05.318 --> 50:08.116
- Yeah.
- She's hot, right?

50:08.154 --> 50:09.178
Let's do it.

50:09.222 --> 50:11.713
- # There's something #
- # About that woman #

50:11.758 --> 50:15.159
# She's got something
you can't live without #

50:15.195 --> 50:17.959
# Makes your heart sing #

50:17.997 --> 50:19.589
Faster, Weedy.

50:19.632 --> 50:21.691
# Something about that woman #

50:21.735 --> 50:25.193
# If you're in doubt
then you are missing out #

50:25.238 --> 50:27.729
# On a good thing #

50:28.742 --> 50:31.006
# I got to give it up #

50:31.044 --> 50:33.774
Teeth, teeth, Weedy, teeth.

50:36.216 --> 50:37.911
- Weedy!
- Yeah?

50:37.951 --> 50:40.818
- Yeah!
- You like that?

50:49.329 --> 50:51.160
Putting it in the ass now, Weedy.

50:54.167 --> 50:55.191
Yeah, how about that?

50:55.235 --> 50:57.294
# Something about that woman #

50:57.337 --> 51:00.773
# She's got something
you can't live without #

51:00.807 --> 51:02.775
# Makes your heart sing #

51:04.511 --> 51:07.241
# It's just something about that woman #

51:07.280 --> 51:10.943
# If you're in doubt
then you are missing out #

51:10.984 --> 51:13.544
# On a good thing #

51:14.320 --> 51:16.083
# I got to give it up #

51:22.061 --> 51:23.323
Wow.

51:28.334 --> 51:29.733
Dude.

51:30.670 --> 51:32.831
I just had the most
fucked-up nightmare.

51:32.872 --> 51:36.933
Come on, man.
I was having a really hot dream.

51:36.976 --> 51:39.638
Go back to bed, please, dude.

52:11.511 --> 52:14.210
Why did we have to leave?
Their <i>Goonies</i> child was kind of cute.

52:14.219 --> 52:16.739
I don't care. It tried to fucking bite me.

52:16.783 --> 52:18.876
Jesus, every time the two of us
try to get anywhere...

52:18.918 --> 52:21.614
it's fucking disaster
after fucking disaster.

52:21.654 --> 52:23.417
Jesus, dude.
Here, you really need a hit of this.

52:23.456 --> 52:26.050
Dude, I don't want a fucking hit!

52:26.092 --> 52:28.390
It's your solution to everything,
you know that?

52:28.428 --> 52:31.397
Think about it.
We should be at Colton's already.

52:31.431 --> 52:34.696
Hey, chill, we still have two days
to fuck up the wedding.

52:34.734 --> 52:36.793
- What?
- What?

52:37.303 --> 52:38.895
- What?
- What?

52:39.339 --> 52:43.673
That's what this is all about, isn't it?
You want to fuck up the wedding.

52:43.710 --> 52:47.043
It's not fucking funny, Kumar.
It's not fucking funny!

52:47.480 --> 52:49.573
Colton is the only guy
that can help us out at this point.

52:49.616 --> 52:52.244
I can't believe... I cannot believe
you're willing to fuck that up!

52:52.285 --> 52:54.185
I just hate that fucking asshole, OK?

52:54.220 --> 52:56.984
Yeah? I like him better
than I like you right now.

52:57.023 --> 52:59.218
- Really?
- Yeah.

52:59.259 --> 53:01.250
You know what he got me? A job.

53:01.294 --> 53:05.230
You know what you got me?
Thrown into Guantánamo Bay.

53:05.265 --> 53:06.960
- Your job sucks.
- Admit it.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.833
You're jealous because Vanessa
found somebody better than you.

53:09.869 --> 53:11.427
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

53:11.471 --> 53:14.065
Better than you! Let me think.

53:14.107 --> 53:17.599
Potential future president,
or unemployed pothead?

53:17.644 --> 53:20.169
Tough. That's tough.
That's a tough one for her, isn't it?

53:20.213 --> 53:22.511
Yeah, well at least
Vanessa's not in Amsterdam...

53:22.549 --> 53:24.380
getting plowed
by a bunch of European dudes.

53:25.552 --> 53:27.019
- What?
- Do you really think Maria's...

53:27.053 --> 53:28.520
saving herself for you, dude?

53:28.555 --> 53:30.489
Right now, she's probably got
two uncircumcised dicks...

53:30.523 --> 53:31.615
dangling in front of her throat.

53:31.658 --> 53:35.116
You know what she's gonna do with them?
Down 'em into her tonsils?

53:39.499 --> 53:41.592
Fucking dick.

53:44.904 --> 53:47.270
- That's my hat.
- That was my hat, bro.

53:49.642 --> 53:51.303
Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria.

53:51.711 --> 53:53.201
Asshole!

53:53.246 --> 53:56.079
Don't you dare say a fucking word
about my angel!

53:58.551 --> 54:00.382
What the fuck was that?

54:00.420 --> 54:02.479
Get up. Get up!

54:02.522 --> 54:04.490
Fuck you.

54:13.700 --> 54:15.292
Shit.

54:18.838 --> 54:21.773
Isn't that a KKK bonfire?

54:21.808 --> 54:22.968
Yeah.

54:24.344 --> 54:26.244
Yeah, I think it is.

54:27.046 --> 54:29.241
Maybe we should
get the fuck out of here.

54:29.282 --> 54:31.307
Yeah. Yeah, dude.

54:31.351 --> 54:33.683
Let's do that.

54:36.656 --> 54:39.489
The other day, caught a rerun
of that show <i>Becker.</i>

54:39.525 --> 54:40.958
You know that show?

54:40.994 --> 54:44.430
Yeah, that's the one
with that Jew, Ted Danson.

54:44.464 --> 54:47.900
That blond negro they got on there,
he had me in stitches.

54:47.934 --> 54:49.492
He's actually pretty funny.

54:49.535 --> 54:51.765
Really? You think so?

54:51.804 --> 54:54.602
I'm not saying I wouldn't
lynch the guy, but...

54:54.641 --> 54:57.439
his timing, it's priceless.

54:58.177 --> 55:00.475
Hold up a second.

55:00.513 --> 55:03.175
I gotta go drain the main vein.

55:20.166 --> 55:22.361
I'll tell ya, Travis...

55:22.402 --> 55:24.768
when it comes to feeling good...

55:24.804 --> 55:27.830
I'd rate pissin' right up there
with comin' and shittin'.

55:29.876 --> 55:31.434
I like to do all three.

55:31.477 --> 55:32.705
Yeah, I hear ya.

55:34.914 --> 55:38.008
Kenny, come on, man.
Hurry the fuck up.

55:38.951 --> 55:42.352
You were the one who made me
drink that third beer.

55:42.388 --> 55:44.822
Hold your horses, peckerwood.

55:45.692 --> 55:48.092
Gross! You fucking pissed on me!

55:48.127 --> 55:50.425
- You racist fuck!
- What the heck?

55:57.203 --> 55:59.228
What the nigger was that?

56:01.274 --> 56:03.868
This is fucked. We are fucked.

56:03.910 --> 56:05.810
Kenny. Travis.

56:07.346 --> 56:10.008
What in the tarnation you guys doin'?

56:10.049 --> 56:12.210
Good, you brought the keg.
Lug that thing over.

56:12.251 --> 56:13.616
- Let's go! Come on!
- Come on!

56:13.653 --> 56:15.917
Let's go, come on!

56:27.233 --> 56:29.963
Yeah, then you put little onions on 'em
and you steam 'em, they're awesome.

56:30.002 --> 56:33.597
Roldy, dude, I'd never thought
I'd say this in a million years...

56:33.639 --> 56:35.231
but the Klan really knows how to party.

56:35.274 --> 56:37.105
You gotta try these dogs.

56:37.143 --> 56:38.132
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

56:38.177 --> 56:40.873
Really know how to...
the Klan knows how to party?

56:40.913 --> 56:42.938
- Dude, we've got to get out of here!
- Jeez, all right, dude, relax.

56:42.982 --> 56:46.440
All right, y'all! Come on over here
and we'll sit around the campfire.

56:46.486 --> 56:48.954
- Shit, what do we do?
- Let's go sit down.

56:48.988 --> 56:50.216
Rufus. Next to them marshmallows...

56:50.256 --> 56:52.486
- and the graham crackers.
- Everybody sit down.

56:52.525 --> 56:55.050
Best s'mores we've had in a long time...

56:55.094 --> 56:57.289
that's what I'm talking about,
that's what I'm talking about.

56:57.330 --> 57:01.061
Now. Now I want
each one of y'all to tell me...

57:01.100 --> 57:03.728
somethin'... Porch monkey, kike!

57:03.770 --> 57:06.671
...that you did
to a minority this week. Yeah.

57:06.706 --> 57:08.799
I tripped a beaner while I was
walking down the stairs...

57:08.841 --> 57:11.071
at the Wal-Mart the other day.

57:12.178 --> 57:13.941
Guy crashed into a bunch of wine bottles.

57:14.680 --> 57:16.807
They made him pay for 'em! Yeah!

57:19.552 --> 57:21.349
All right, all right, let's all calm down.

57:21.387 --> 57:24.413
White power here, white power here,
white power here.

57:25.391 --> 57:27.256
Giving him what he deserves.

57:27.293 --> 57:28.590
Hebe!

57:30.596 --> 57:33.087
All right, I'm back. Next.

57:33.132 --> 57:35.259
It better be good. Here.

57:39.405 --> 57:41.669
Come on, dude, say something.

57:44.076 --> 57:45.873
You know what?

57:47.547 --> 57:49.538
I did knee an Indian guy in the balls.

57:49.582 --> 57:50.606
That's funny!

57:52.285 --> 57:54.617
Yeah, send them Indians back to Africa.

57:54.687 --> 57:58.783
Well, you want to hear something real
fucked-up and awesome that I did?

57:58.825 --> 58:03.558
I took a Korean guy's toothbrush
and I rubbed it all over my dick.

58:03.596 --> 58:07.532
- You did that?
- Well, that's just downright disgustin'.

58:07.567 --> 58:09.330
- But I like it!
- Yeah!

58:10.503 --> 58:12.801
Yeah, I love bein' white.

58:14.040 --> 58:16.975
- What the...
- Look what we got us here, brothers.

58:20.346 --> 58:22.541
Mexicans!

58:22.582 --> 58:25.244
Lynch 'em!

58:25.284 --> 58:26.546
Come on, come on! Come on!

58:29.322 --> 58:32.485
Come on, boys, let's chase them
back to the border!

58:33.926 --> 58:34.915
Pussy fart!

58:37.730 --> 58:40.164
Holy shit!

58:40.199 --> 58:42.133
Should we put it out or what?

58:44.437 --> 58:46.302
Are they still behind us?

58:46.339 --> 58:49.331
I don't think so.
Dude, the Klan is fucking slow.

58:52.078 --> 58:54.478
Hey, flag down this car.

58:54.513 --> 58:57.209
Help! Help! Help!

58:58.718 --> 59:01.084
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

59:02.421 --> 59:03.649
# Yeah #

59:03.689 --> 59:05.156
Thanks for stopping.

59:05.191 --> 59:06.180
# You better check yo self #

59:06.225 --> 59:07.487
No problem.

59:07.526 --> 59:09.255
# 'Cause I'm bad for your health,
I come real stealth #

59:09.295 --> 59:10.785
Neil?

59:10.830 --> 59:13.355
Gary and Kumar!

59:13.399 --> 59:14.457
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

59:14.500 --> 59:15.489
Harold. Harold.

59:15.534 --> 59:17.024
Sorry, man. I forgot.

59:19.238 --> 59:21.365
What are you doing here, man?

59:21.407 --> 59:24.865
This is where God took me.
What are you guys doing out here?

59:24.911 --> 59:27.402
We're actually trying to get to Texas.

59:27.446 --> 59:28.811
That's where I'm headed!

59:30.349 --> 59:31.338
What are the odds?

59:32.251 --> 59:33.240
Let's get out of here.

59:33.286 --> 59:34.844
- All right.
- Thank you.

59:35.521 --> 59:36.510
Shrooms?

59:36.555 --> 59:38.853
- No. Thanks, though.
- No, thank you.

59:38.891 --> 59:40.722
Suit yourself.

59:45.398 --> 59:47.423
Gentlemen, start your engines.

59:48.234 --> 59:50.566
It's gonna be a bumpy fuckin' ride.

59:50.603 --> 59:52.503
# 'Cause shotgun bullets
are bad for your health #

59:57.410 --> 59:59.878
We found their phone.

01:00:00.746 --> 01:00:03.374
Lee and Patel made a phone call to you.

01:00:05.251 --> 01:00:07.446
Now tell us everything you know
about their terrorist plot.

01:00:07.486 --> 01:00:10.512
Terrorist plot? Rold and Kumar?

01:00:10.556 --> 01:00:12.786
This is ridiculous.

01:00:12.825 --> 01:00:15.385
OK, fine. Fine.

01:00:15.428 --> 01:00:17.988
Mr. Rosenberg.

01:00:18.030 --> 01:00:20.863
Mr. Gold-stein.

01:00:21.801 --> 01:00:23.894
We'll do it your way.

01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:30.971
What's this? What do we have here?

01:00:57.870 --> 01:00:59.565
It's about seven dollars?

01:00:59.605 --> 01:01:01.266
Look, don't insult us, all right?

01:01:01.307 --> 01:01:02.774
I don't know
what the hell is going on here...

01:01:02.808 --> 01:01:05.538
but I'm pleading the Fifth
until I speak to my lawyer.

01:01:05.578 --> 01:01:07.842
You're pleading the Fifth, huh?

01:01:08.981 --> 01:01:10.949
Beecher, give me a copy
of the Bill of Rights.

01:01:10.983 --> 01:01:12.507
The Bill of Rights? Why?

01:01:12.551 --> 01:01:14.610
Just do it!

01:01:14.653 --> 01:01:16.587
Excuse me.

01:01:18.824 --> 01:01:19.813
Five, right?

01:01:19.859 --> 01:01:21.156
- Five alive.
- Sure.

01:01:21.193 --> 01:01:23.753
OK. OK. Good.

01:01:26.165 --> 01:01:29.532
You wanna know what I think
about the Fifth Amendment?

01:01:37.043 --> 01:01:38.476
There it is.

01:01:45.151 --> 01:01:47.984
That's what I think
of the Fifth Amendment.

01:01:50.923 --> 01:01:53.619
Why the hell is your ass so dirty?
Don't you wipe?

01:01:53.659 --> 01:01:57.220
Don't ask questions
you don't want the answer to, buddy.

01:01:57.263 --> 01:01:58.252
What do ya got?

01:01:58.297 --> 01:02:01.357
Turns out the FBI was already
tapping Mr. Goldstein's phone.

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:03.163
- We got what we need.
- Wait a second.

01:02:03.202 --> 01:02:05.534
You were tapping my phone?

01:02:05.571 --> 01:02:06.560
You want to hear the tape?

01:02:06.605 --> 01:02:10.837
No. I'm sick of listening
to this dirt farmer. What's the upshot?

01:02:10.876 --> 01:02:13.344
Lee and Patel are on their way
to Texas as we speak.

01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:15.540
I knew they'd trip up.

01:02:15.581 --> 01:02:19.381
Ready the plane.
These fuckers are goin' down.

01:02:26.425 --> 01:02:30.054
Neil, can you just focus on driving?
You've had... Focus on the road.

01:02:30.096 --> 01:02:32.656
You've had dozens of shrooms,
my friend.

01:02:33.332 --> 01:02:36.426
Dude, I was able to perform
an appendectomy at age 14.

01:02:36.469 --> 01:02:39.632
I think I can handle
a couple mushrooms.

01:02:39.672 --> 01:02:43.199
- Wasn't that just a TV show?
- Jesus Christ!

01:02:43.242 --> 01:02:46.040
Did you see that unicorn?

01:02:46.078 --> 01:02:47.841
Its horn was so shiny.

01:02:48.848 --> 01:02:52.340
So, why are you guys headed to Texas?

01:02:52.384 --> 01:02:55.285
Let's just say
my ex-girlfriend's getting married.

01:02:58.524 --> 01:03:00.492
The one that got away, huh?

01:03:00.526 --> 01:03:02.187
Yep.

01:03:02.228 --> 01:03:04.219
Sounds to me like you need a drink.

01:03:05.064 --> 01:03:07.362
Road. Neil, please,
can you pay attention...

01:03:07.399 --> 01:03:09.333
Dude, I've got it!

01:03:09.368 --> 01:03:12.269
- Yeah, but...
- He's a good driver. Stop.

01:03:12.304 --> 01:03:15.364
Thanks, man. Cheers, dude.

01:03:15.407 --> 01:03:16.533
Really? Drinking?

01:03:23.883 --> 01:03:25.942
I have a lost-love story of my own.

01:03:25.985 --> 01:03:26.974
Yeah?

01:03:27.686 --> 01:03:29.950
Happened on the set of <i>Clara's Heart.</i>

01:03:29.989 --> 01:03:31.479
Sure, sure, yeah.

01:03:31.524 --> 01:03:35.016
I'll never forget her.
Her name was Tashonda.

01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:36.891
She was Whoopi Goldberg's stand-in.

01:03:36.929 --> 01:03:40.922
Her skin was so soft,
her lips were so sweet.

01:03:42.034 --> 01:03:46.937
She had these tiny,
little Hershey Kiss nipples...

01:03:47.706 --> 01:03:50.834
that you just wanted
to suck on all night long.

01:03:51.343 --> 01:03:54.608
Anyway, last day of shooting, I told her.

01:03:54.647 --> 01:03:56.410
I said...

01:03:56.448 --> 01:04:00.179
"T-Bird, we're gonna have to break up."

01:04:00.219 --> 01:04:01.811
Why did you do that?

01:04:02.788 --> 01:04:05.723
I didn't think I could take on
that kind of responsibility.

01:04:07.326 --> 01:04:10.318
It was such a big mistake.

01:04:10.362 --> 01:04:12.694
Why? I mean, with T-Bird gone...

01:04:12.731 --> 01:04:15.063
couldn't you have sex
with whoever you wanted?

01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:16.294
Let me be clear.

01:04:16.335 --> 01:04:18.200
There is nothing on the planet...

01:04:18.237 --> 01:04:20.535
that I love more than a hot, new pussy.

01:04:20.573 --> 01:04:22.097
- Sure.
- Nothing.

01:04:22.141 --> 01:04:24.234
What does the P.H. stands for in N.P. H?

01:04:25.511 --> 01:04:26.603
Patrick Harris.

01:04:26.645 --> 01:04:29.273
No, common mistake. Poon handler.

01:04:30.182 --> 01:04:31.843
The point is, boys...

01:04:31.884 --> 01:04:36.480
even though I love havin' sex
with some hot, random trim...

01:04:36.522 --> 01:04:41.482
a day hasn't gone by
where I haven't thought of Tashonda.

01:04:42.361 --> 01:04:47.663
Every time I see a bag of
Hershey's Kisses, my balls get so wet.

01:04:52.738 --> 01:04:54.763
Here's to you, Tashonda.

01:04:55.474 --> 01:04:59.103
- I hope you kept the baby.
- Wow.

01:05:25.070 --> 01:05:28.164
# Free on my own #

01:05:28.207 --> 01:05:31.267
# That's the way I used to be #

01:05:31.310 --> 01:05:32.868
# But since I met you, baby #

01:05:32.911 --> 01:05:35.072
Hey, honey.
What's up?

01:05:35.114 --> 01:05:37.742
I found something in your purse.

01:05:38.617 --> 01:05:40.084
Why would you go through my purse?

01:05:40.119 --> 01:05:41.780
Why would you have a joint...

01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:44.914
when you know
it could ruin my political career?

01:05:44.957 --> 01:05:46.015
I'm sorry.

01:05:46.058 --> 01:05:50.324
What with all the wedding plans,
I've just been a little stressed.

01:05:50.362 --> 01:05:52.296
It helps me relax?

01:05:52.331 --> 01:05:55.789
Marijuana is illegal, Vanessa.

01:05:55.834 --> 01:05:57.665
Now, I thought that part of your life
was in the past.

01:05:57.703 --> 01:06:00.137
- It is.
- Good.

01:06:01.507 --> 01:06:02.599
That's all I need to hear.

01:06:05.244 --> 01:06:08.042
Hey, baby.

01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:11.413
Look, I know things can be hectic
with the wedding.

01:06:11.450 --> 01:06:15.819
But, you know, if you get stressed out,
just do what I do.

01:06:15.854 --> 01:06:17.879
Snort Zoloft, OK?

01:06:25.497 --> 01:06:27.795
What the fuck?

01:06:27.833 --> 01:06:28.822
Shit.

01:06:28.867 --> 01:06:32.325
Dude, they set up a fucking roadblock!
They're gonna find us.

01:06:32.371 --> 01:06:34.168
- What are you talking about?
- Neil...

01:06:34.206 --> 01:06:36.401
I don't know how to say this
any other way, man, but we're fugitives.

01:06:36.442 --> 01:06:38.034
Cool.

01:06:39.378 --> 01:06:41.676
OK, well, we've got to find a way
to get out of this.

01:06:41.714 --> 01:06:43.341
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Please.

01:06:43.382 --> 01:06:47.284
You act like I've never smuggled
a fugitive across state lines before.

01:06:47.319 --> 01:06:49.617
Here. Hide in that.

01:06:49.655 --> 01:06:52.021
Sorry. It's a little sticky.

01:06:54.426 --> 01:06:56.223
Shit.

01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:02.590
Yeah.

01:07:04.803 --> 01:07:06.964
What the... When were you
gonna show me these?

01:07:15.214 --> 01:07:17.148
Excuse me.

01:07:17.916 --> 01:07:19.076
Wait, Officer!

01:07:20.018 --> 01:07:22.452
- Shit.
- Hold that car!

01:07:36.402 --> 01:07:40.338
Neil Patrick Harris.

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:42.664
Yo.

01:07:44.610 --> 01:07:47.909
It is an honor to meet you, sir.

01:07:47.946 --> 01:07:50.437
Yeah. I would imagine so.

01:07:52.484 --> 01:07:54.418
I'm sure you get this all the time...

01:07:54.453 --> 01:08:01.325
but your part in <i>Starship Troopers</i>
truly, truly changed my life.

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:02.657
Really?

01:08:02.694 --> 01:08:04.491
How?

01:08:04.530 --> 01:08:09.729
Well, no one thought the war against
the arachnids of Klendathu could be won.

01:08:09.768 --> 01:08:11.201
- But you showed the starship troopers...
- Neil!

01:08:11.236 --> 01:08:13.170
...that those bugs could be destroyed.

01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:19.673
A lot of people think the war on terror
is a war that can't be won, right?

01:08:20.979 --> 01:08:23.538
That's why I joined
the Department of Homeland Security.

01:08:23.582 --> 01:08:28.212
My friend, two words.
<i>Starship</i> fuckin' <i>Troopers.</i>

01:08:28.252 --> 01:08:32.451
If you want to know the secret of being,
you will come with us.

01:08:33.792 --> 01:08:35.817
Please. I really need to go.

01:08:35.861 --> 01:08:39.729
Yeah, of course. I'm so sorry
to bother you. You move along.

01:08:42.935 --> 01:08:44.903
Bye.

01:08:45.537 --> 01:08:46.902
I love you.

01:08:50.142 --> 01:08:51.973
I love you too, Mr. Patrick Harris.

01:08:53.479 --> 01:08:54.639
What the...

01:09:02.054 --> 01:09:03.817
Holy fucking shit, that was awesome.

01:09:04.823 --> 01:09:06.916
Try having that conversation
on shrooms.

01:09:06.959 --> 01:09:08.823
I deserve an Oscar
for that performance.

01:09:08.861 --> 01:09:09.850
- You do!
- Dudes...

01:09:09.895 --> 01:09:11.760
I'm gonna take a little detour
on the way, all right?

01:09:11.796 --> 01:09:12.786
- No.
- Neil, no.

01:09:12.831 --> 01:09:13.819
But we're almost there, man.

01:09:13.866 --> 01:09:15.993
- No buts. No buts!
- What do you do...

01:09:16.033 --> 01:09:18.969
I'm going to a whorehouse
and I'm gonna get my fuck on.

01:09:19.004 --> 01:09:23.532
If you two don't want to get
your dicks wet, that's fine with me.

01:09:24.243 --> 01:09:26.370
I'll get my dick wet.

01:09:32.451 --> 01:09:36.751
# Don't need nothin' but a good time #

01:09:36.787 --> 01:09:39.416
# How can I resist? #

01:09:39.457 --> 01:09:43.394
# Ain't lookin' for nothin'
but a good time #

01:09:43.428 --> 01:09:47.261
# And it don't get better than this #

01:09:47.765 --> 01:09:51.133
Pussy, I'm home!

01:09:51.169 --> 01:09:52.636
Hello?

01:09:53.438 --> 01:09:58.603
Well, well, well. I thought you'd never
show your face around here again.

01:09:58.644 --> 01:10:01.408
What's the matter, Sally? I thought
I was one of your top customers.

01:10:01.446 --> 01:10:04.540
Have you forgotten what happened
the last time you were here?

01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:07.818
Because of you, my best girl quit.

01:10:07.853 --> 01:10:09.650
Hey, I paid her good money.

01:10:09.688 --> 01:10:11.315
It's not my fault
she didn't lube up.

01:10:11.890 --> 01:10:15.053
Besides, I bring you new customers.

01:10:15.093 --> 01:10:18.221
- New customers?
- No, Neil, that's all.

01:10:18.263 --> 01:10:20.288
Thank you. Thank you.
Appreciate it. Appreciate it.

01:10:20.332 --> 01:10:22.562
Sally. Bring on the lineup.

01:10:25.304 --> 01:10:27.295
Line up in the chutes, girls.

01:10:27.339 --> 01:10:30.172
Longhorns coming through.

01:10:30.208 --> 01:10:31.300
Neil.

01:10:35.247 --> 01:10:38.080
Bigger. Bigger. Bigger. Bigger.

01:10:38.116 --> 01:10:39.981
Hello, ba...

01:10:41.119 --> 01:10:43.883
- What's your name, miss?
- Tits Hemingway.

01:10:43.922 --> 01:10:45.480
How'd you come up with that?

01:10:45.524 --> 01:10:47.458
Well, I have huge tits.

01:10:47.492 --> 01:10:49.892
And my favorite book
is <i>A Moveable Feast.</i>

01:10:49.928 --> 01:10:52.488
I guess that makes sense, yeah.

01:10:52.531 --> 01:10:54.089
Well, I hope you're ready for me, Tits...

01:10:54.132 --> 01:10:56.430
'cause I'm gonna rock out
with my cock out...

01:10:56.468 --> 01:10:58.197
and you're gonna jam out
with your clam out.

01:10:58.236 --> 01:10:59.931
It's gonna be magical.

01:11:00.839 --> 01:11:02.773
- The whores are on me, fellas.
- No, Neil...

01:11:02.808 --> 01:11:04.605
- thank you, but we... that's...
- Thanks, dude.

01:11:04.643 --> 01:11:06.133
Screw that, Roldy.
I don't know about you...

01:11:06.178 --> 01:11:09.545
but, no offense to the rest of you ladies,
I am gonna be taking you two.

01:11:09.748 --> 01:11:12.216
No, Kumar. Kumar!

01:11:12.250 --> 01:11:13.740
Roldy, you're missing out, brother.

01:11:14.653 --> 01:11:16.678
Yo, we need to get back on the road,
buddy.

01:11:16.722 --> 01:11:18.155
We need...

01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:24.595
Well, now, you know, we also supply...

01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:28.259
in-room films or a magazine.

01:11:30.268 --> 01:11:32.896
Well, if you'd like
some self-satisfaction...

01:11:32.938 --> 01:11:35.031
we do have some...

01:11:36.775 --> 01:11:39.141
electronic devices right over there.

01:11:42.581 --> 01:11:45.175
Just have some coffee. Yeah?

01:11:45.217 --> 01:11:48.050
Why don't you lie on the bed?

01:11:48.086 --> 01:11:50.577
And tell us what you want us to do.

01:11:50.622 --> 01:11:52.988
OK. OK.

01:11:54.326 --> 01:11:55.953
Well...

01:11:57.496 --> 01:11:59.327
how about...

01:12:00.332 --> 01:12:02.800
How about you take off your clothes
and make out with each other?

01:12:02.834 --> 01:12:05.234
- We've done that before.
- We can do that.

01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:06.362
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:12:06.405 --> 01:12:08.168
# Pussy real good #

01:12:08.206 --> 01:12:09.867
- # That pussy #
- # Pussy real good #

01:12:09.908 --> 01:12:12.240
- # That pussy #
- # That pussy off the chain #

01:12:12.277 --> 01:12:14.438
- # That pussy #
- # Go on and do yo thang #

01:12:14.479 --> 01:12:16.811
- # That pussy #
- # Pussy real good #

01:12:16.848 --> 01:12:18.907
- # That pussy #
- # That pussy real good #

01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:20.884
# That pussy #

01:12:20.919 --> 01:12:22.716
# Yo' mama don't like #

01:12:23.455 --> 01:12:25.389
# She say I'm no good #

01:12:25.424 --> 01:12:27.358
# What she don't know is #

01:12:27.392 --> 01:12:29.724
# I got you pussy-whooped #

01:12:29.761 --> 01:12:32.025
# He need this pussy #

01:12:32.064 --> 01:12:34.328
# He smell this pussy #

01:12:34.366 --> 01:12:36.459
# He wanna taste this pussy #

01:12:36.501 --> 01:12:38.901
# He gotta pay for pussy #

01:12:38.937 --> 01:12:40.734
Can you use tongue?

01:12:40.772 --> 01:12:43.002
# That pussy, pussy #

01:12:43.041 --> 01:12:44.702
# Pussy, pussy #

01:12:46.311 --> 01:12:48.040
Bump your titty on her titty.

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:49.513
# Police pull me over #

01:12:49.548 --> 01:12:51.539
# They don't write no tickets #

01:12:52.651 --> 01:12:54.551
Boner achieved!

01:12:55.587 --> 01:12:59.114
Great. Now let's get those pants off.

01:12:59.157 --> 01:13:00.488
OK.

01:13:01.026 --> 01:13:04.291
- You are benevolent human beings.
- Yeah, I know.

01:13:04.329 --> 01:13:05.694
- Yeah?
- We get that a lot.

01:13:05.797 --> 01:13:07.560
Yeah. You know what that means,
benevolent?

01:13:07.599 --> 01:13:09.191
Yeah, I do, actually.

01:13:09.234 --> 01:13:10.496
What?

01:13:10.535 --> 01:13:12.696
It means we're gonna fuck you so hard...

01:13:12.738 --> 01:13:15.104
your dick's gonna be sore for two weeks.

01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:18.268
That is exactly, exactly what it means.

01:13:19.344 --> 01:13:22.245
You know what bothers me
the most, though?

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:25.408
He never once apologized
for getting me into all this trouble.

01:13:25.450 --> 01:13:30.444
I mean, I'm supposed to be with my
Maria right now in Amsterdam, OK?

01:13:30.489 --> 01:13:33.925
But it's cool.
He doesn't know how to say "I'm sorry."

01:13:34.359 --> 01:13:36.156
Why do you think that is?

01:13:36.194 --> 01:13:40.631
Sparkle, because it's all about
what he wants. It's about him, him, him.

01:13:40.665 --> 01:13:43.862
You know. I don't even care
because... You know...

01:13:43.902 --> 01:13:46.666
if he can't be a good friend to me,
I'm not gonna be a good friend to him.

01:13:46.705 --> 01:13:48.866
- It's done.
- Don't say that.

01:13:49.307 --> 01:13:51.275
A good friend is hard to come by.

01:13:51.309 --> 01:13:52.742
Venus, come on.

01:13:52.778 --> 01:13:56.009
Yeah, but if he was a real friend,
he would know how to say, "I'm sorry."

01:13:56.081 --> 01:13:57.412
That's right.

01:13:57.449 --> 01:13:59.440
Thank you, Agnes.

01:14:00.352 --> 01:14:01.341
Nail on the head.

01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:03.312
It's like right now...

01:14:03.355 --> 01:14:08.292
after all the shit that we have
been through in the last few days...

01:14:08.326 --> 01:14:13.525
you know, he's in there having
the time of his life, having sex.

01:14:16.935 --> 01:14:19.426
I never should have left her.

01:14:20.005 --> 01:14:21.666
I don't even know...

01:14:21.706 --> 01:14:24.106
I don't even know what I was thinking.

01:14:24.142 --> 01:14:26.975
I loved her so much.

01:14:27.012 --> 01:14:29.207
She was my little baby.

01:14:29.247 --> 01:14:31.112
She was my little baby.

01:14:31.149 --> 01:14:32.309
Why did I let my little baby go?

01:14:32.350 --> 01:14:34.614
Why did I let her go?

01:14:34.653 --> 01:14:36.553
You'll find someone else.

01:14:36.588 --> 01:14:38.283
No, I won't. Not like Vanessa.

01:14:38.323 --> 01:14:40.723
You'll find love again someday.

01:14:40.759 --> 01:14:42.989
Yeah, you will.

01:14:43.595 --> 01:14:45.893
Did you guys?

01:14:47.465 --> 01:14:49.865
No, we're whores.

01:14:49.901 --> 01:14:52.199
- Remember?
- Yeah.

01:14:58.710 --> 01:15:00.041
Oh, my God. Are you OK?

01:15:00.078 --> 01:15:01.875
What the hell is going on here?

01:15:01.913 --> 01:15:04.814
That prick fucking branded me!

01:15:05.717 --> 01:15:07.241
- Stop it.
- I warned you, Neil.

01:15:07.285 --> 01:15:09.719
Bring it.

01:15:09.754 --> 01:15:12.086
- Neil! Neil!
- Time to put your dick in the dirt.

01:15:12.123 --> 01:15:14.523
- What... Neil! What are you doing?
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:15:14.559 --> 01:15:15.548
- But...
- No, Neil.

01:15:15.594 --> 01:15:17.061
Neil!

01:15:17.963 --> 01:15:20.397
- What about Neil, man?
- No, fuck Neil. He just fucked us.

01:15:20.432 --> 01:15:22.957
- Neil! Neil!
- Come on, come on, come on!

01:15:23.001 --> 01:15:24.662
- Come on! Come on! Come on!
- Neil!

01:15:24.703 --> 01:15:26.170
Come on!

01:15:27.539 --> 01:15:29.063
- N.P. H!
- No!

01:15:30.876 --> 01:15:32.104
Stop! Stop!

01:15:33.278 --> 01:15:34.973
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
We've got to get Neil.

01:15:35.013 --> 01:15:36.674
- Why?
- Look, we're stealing his car!

01:15:36.715 --> 01:15:39.582
- We can't leave him back there.
- He stole your fucking car last week!

01:15:40.585 --> 01:15:42.246
What was that?

01:15:42.921 --> 01:15:43.910
- Hurry up.
- Neil!

01:15:43.955 --> 01:15:45.718
- Hurry up. Come on, man.
- Guys.

01:15:45.757 --> 01:15:47.691
- All right. Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.
- Neil, Neil, come on! Come on, man!

01:15:47.726 --> 01:15:49.557
- Guys!
- Hurry up! Hurry up!

01:15:49.594 --> 01:15:51.061
It's not even funny.
Hurry up, dude, hurry up.

01:15:51.096 --> 01:15:52.893
You can make it, dude.

01:15:52.931 --> 01:15:56.389
Oh, my God! Holy shit!

01:15:57.302 --> 01:16:00.271
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Jesus Christ!

01:16:00.305 --> 01:16:02.500
- Neil's dead! Neil's dead!
- No!

01:16:03.174 --> 01:16:07.110
- Oh, my God!
- Get the fuck out of here! Go! Go!

01:16:09.414 --> 01:16:15.876
# How do I say goodbye #

01:16:15.921 --> 01:16:17.650
It's the dawn of a new day.

01:16:20.492 --> 01:16:22.585
And Neil Patrick Harris
isn't around to see it, man.

01:16:22.627 --> 01:16:23.616
Dude, I told you.

01:16:23.662 --> 01:16:25.152
Will you please stop saying that?

01:16:26.231 --> 01:16:27.721
God.

01:16:27.766 --> 01:16:30.234
He's gone.

01:16:30.902 --> 01:16:33.894
Maybe he's got
some family contact info in here.

01:16:33.939 --> 01:16:36.134
Dude, I know
I'm not calling Neil's parents.

01:16:36.975 --> 01:16:39.000
What's in the bag?

01:16:39.044 --> 01:16:41.569
- Holy fuck.
- Creepy mask.

01:16:42.514 --> 01:16:45.108
A jar with hair in it.

01:16:47.585 --> 01:16:50.645
And, like, 12 cans of Mace.

01:16:53.325 --> 01:16:56.158
- Look, dude.
- Holy shit.

01:16:56.194 --> 01:16:58.560
Holy shit, we actually made it.

01:17:05.370 --> 01:17:07.600
This is where Colton grew up, huh?

01:17:07.639 --> 01:17:09.937
Smell that? That smells like douche.

01:17:16.181 --> 01:17:19.116
No, you will remain in this car.

01:17:19.150 --> 01:17:22.381
I will go inside alone and, if we're lucky,
Colton will help us out.

01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:26.322
- Why can't I just...
- No. Let me put it another way.

01:17:26.358 --> 01:17:30.089
You leave this car,
and our friendship is over.

01:17:30.128 --> 01:17:32.596
- But, Roldy, I just...
- Kumar.

01:17:32.630 --> 01:17:35.622
Open the door
and I will cut your fucking balls off.

01:17:35.667 --> 01:17:36.793
Jesus. OK.

01:17:40.538 --> 01:17:42.529
- Balls.
- Go.

01:17:54.319 --> 01:17:56.844
Hi, I'm a friend of Colton's.

01:17:56.888 --> 01:17:58.412
Thank you.

01:18:41.599 --> 01:18:42.896
God damn it.

01:18:42.934 --> 01:18:45.232
Vanessa? You OK?

01:18:45.270 --> 01:18:48.603
- Kumar? What are you doing here?
- Yeah, let me help you up.

01:18:52.444 --> 01:18:54.241
I thought you were going to Amsterdam.

01:18:54.279 --> 01:18:56.941
Yeah, me too. It didn't work out.

01:18:57.949 --> 01:18:59.211
You all right?

01:18:59.250 --> 01:19:01.810
- Now, does this hurt when I touch it?
- Yeah.

01:19:01.853 --> 01:19:03.445
- It does?
- Yeah.

01:19:03.488 --> 01:19:07.390
This is just what I need.
A limp during the wedding.

01:19:07.425 --> 01:19:09.620
Can you move it around in a circle?

01:19:10.628 --> 01:19:13.825
OK, that's what I figured. It's just your
ATFL. I don't think you tore it, though.

01:19:13.865 --> 01:19:17.426
So a little ice and massage
should do the trick. You'll be fine.

01:19:17.469 --> 01:19:19.596
Are you gonna tell me why you're here?

01:19:19.637 --> 01:19:21.628
Roldy and I ran into some trouble...

01:19:21.673 --> 01:19:25.609
and we figured that maybe
your Colton could help us out.

01:19:25.643 --> 01:19:28.806
- Still getting into trouble, huh?
- A little bit.

01:19:28.847 --> 01:19:31.839
You remember that time that
you broke into the animal lab...

01:19:31.883 --> 01:19:34.909
and, like, stole that monkey and put it
in Andy Rosenberg's dorm room?

01:19:34.953 --> 01:19:36.648
OK, first of all,
that was Goldstein's idea...

01:19:36.688 --> 01:19:37.677
and second of all...

01:19:37.722 --> 01:19:40.418
had I known that the monkey had AIDS,
I never would have done that.

01:19:40.458 --> 01:19:41.447
What about you?

01:19:41.493 --> 01:19:44.929
You put those disgusting used tampons
in Professor Konop's purse.

01:19:44.963 --> 01:19:46.521
- Remember that?
- Come on.

01:19:46.564 --> 01:19:47.963
She was a bitch and you know it.

01:19:51.803 --> 01:19:54.135
What's going on here?

01:19:54.172 --> 01:19:57.164
Hey, she actually fell
and broke her heel here.

01:19:57.208 --> 01:20:01.440
Yeah, I twisted my ankle.
Kumar was just looking at it.

01:20:01.479 --> 01:20:03.538
- Why aren't you in the car, Kumar?
- Dude, I heard her yell.

01:20:03.581 --> 01:20:05.173
I thought I told you
to stay in the car, man.

01:20:05.850 --> 01:20:07.147
It's OK, man.

01:20:07.185 --> 01:20:08.675
No worries.

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:11.314
Listen, Roldy filled me in
on the situation.

01:20:11.356 --> 01:20:14.120
But don't worry. I'll make sure
my dad takes care of everything.

01:20:15.293 --> 01:20:16.282
Thanks, man.

01:20:16.327 --> 01:20:19.319
In the meantime,
you are going to the doctor.

01:20:19.364 --> 01:20:21.491
Ramón!

01:20:21.533 --> 01:20:25.867
Ramón. Please bring Vanessa
to Dr. Harris immediately.

01:20:27.272 --> 01:20:30.332
Bye, Vanessa. Hope you feel better.

01:20:31.509 --> 01:20:34.910
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:20:37.115 --> 01:20:39.083
Guys.

01:20:39.117 --> 01:20:40.550
All right.

01:20:42.353 --> 01:20:45.845
All right, guys. Jet's all fueled.
You should be home in no time.

01:20:45.890 --> 01:20:47.289
Sweet.

01:20:53.631 --> 01:20:55.861
Hey, Colton, I can't believe
you're doing this for us...

01:20:55.900 --> 01:20:56.958
on the night before your wedding day.

01:20:57.001 --> 01:21:00.630
- I really appreciate it. Thank you.
- Please don't mention it.

01:21:00.672 --> 01:21:03.539
Just want to make sure
everything works out smoothly.

01:21:03.575 --> 01:21:05.202
Are all these planes yours?

01:21:05.243 --> 01:21:07.541
No. OK.

01:21:07.579 --> 01:21:09.171
Rold, come on, of course they are.

01:21:11.616 --> 01:21:12.708
This guy's funny. You're funny.

01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:14.911
- Yeah?
- Hey, Colton, man.

01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:19.215
Listen, I was wrong about you, dude.
You're not a douchebag.

01:21:19.257 --> 01:21:20.417
Dude.

01:21:20.458 --> 01:21:22.085
You know what I mean.
I mean, you're a good dude.

01:21:22.126 --> 01:21:24.287
And I'm happy for you and Vanessa.

01:21:27.065 --> 01:21:28.862
That's big of you, Kumar.

01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:30.765
- I really appreciate it.
- Sure.

01:21:30.802 --> 01:21:32.963
I just can't wait to get back, man.

01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:37.638
You're going back all right.

01:21:38.343 --> 01:21:40.538
This time you're not escaping.

01:21:40.578 --> 01:21:42.239
Now!

01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:43.747
Go! Move, move, move!

01:21:49.821 --> 01:21:50.879
You are a douchebag...

01:21:50.922 --> 01:21:53.288
- No.
...you fucking douchebag, fuck you!

01:21:53.324 --> 01:21:56.157
Yeah. The last thing I was letting
you guys do is ruin my wedding.

01:21:56.194 --> 01:21:58.924
- You did this?
- Of course he did this.

01:21:58.963 --> 01:22:01.397
I thought we were friends, man.
How could you betray me like this?

01:22:01.432 --> 01:22:03.423
Come on, Rold. You and me?

01:22:03.468 --> 01:22:05.493
You let me cheat off you
in Advanced Accounting.

01:22:05.536 --> 01:22:07.231
Other than that,
I could give a shit about you.

01:22:07.272 --> 01:22:08.671
Take 'em away, guys.

01:22:09.173 --> 01:22:11.607
When we get out of this I'm gonna
fucking kick your fucking ass, man!

01:22:11.643 --> 01:22:13.304
Boy, you're scaring me.

01:22:13.344 --> 01:22:15.539
Well, come on, you're not
one of those kung-fu Asians...

01:22:15.580 --> 01:22:17.946
you're a fucking pussy banker,
for Christ's sakes.

01:22:17.982 --> 01:22:20.075
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- I'm gonna rip you up, bitch!

01:22:20.118 --> 01:22:22.746
- You'd best watch your back, bitch!
- Fuck you, dude!

01:22:22.787 --> 01:22:24.982
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

01:22:25.923 --> 01:22:28.084
I'm awesome.

01:22:33.097 --> 01:22:35.998
Looks like you boys picked
the wrong side, huh?

01:22:36.034 --> 01:22:38.468
Where's your Koran now?

01:22:39.237 --> 01:22:41.068
We're not even Muslim, you moron...

01:22:41.105 --> 01:22:44.336
and even if we were,
that doesn't make us terrorists.

01:22:44.575 --> 01:22:46.975
Hey! I'm talking to you.
Get back here!

01:22:47.011 --> 01:22:51.107
# Metal under tension
beggin' you to touch and go #

01:22:52.617 --> 01:22:55.017
# Highway to #

01:22:56.387 --> 01:22:58.947
Man. I can't believe we're going back.

01:22:58.990 --> 01:23:01.117
Now do you see
why I hate Colton Graham?

01:23:01.159 --> 01:23:03.787
Now do you see why I hate you?

01:23:04.762 --> 01:23:07.253
I asked you specifically
to stay in the car.

01:23:07.298 --> 01:23:09.960
I told you our friendship was at stake.

01:23:10.001 --> 01:23:11.525
Vanessa fell down.
And I was helping her.

01:23:11.569 --> 01:23:13.594
- I don't want to hear the excuses!
- It's not an excuse!

01:23:13.638 --> 01:23:14.866
I don't want to hear the excuses!

01:23:14.906 --> 01:23:16.669
- I heard her yelling!
- I don't want to hear it.

01:23:23.081 --> 01:23:24.844
I'm sorry.

01:23:25.683 --> 01:23:26.980
'Kay?

01:23:28.052 --> 01:23:29.485
Look at this. Look at this.

01:23:30.521 --> 01:23:32.648
I fucked up, OK?

01:23:32.690 --> 01:23:36.456
I fucked up and I always fuck up.
I am a fuck-up.

01:23:36.494 --> 01:23:37.859
You think?

01:23:38.863 --> 01:23:40.353
Harold...

01:23:41.366 --> 01:23:42.663
you're my best friend, dude.

01:23:44.035 --> 01:23:46.367
You mean the world to me, man.
I love you.

01:23:46.404 --> 01:23:47.393
Queers.

01:23:47.438 --> 01:23:48.462
And I promise you, if we figure out...

01:23:48.506 --> 01:23:50.770
a way to get out of this,
I'm gonna change, OK?

01:23:50.808 --> 01:23:52.742
It's not just gonna be
about Kumar all the time.

01:23:52.777 --> 01:23:55.575
It'll be about Kumar and Harold.

01:23:58.383 --> 01:23:59.975
Harold and Kumar.

01:24:01.753 --> 01:24:03.050
I kind of like the first way better.

01:24:03.087 --> 01:24:05.453
OK, OK. Harold and Kumar.

01:24:05.490 --> 01:24:07.014
Harold and Kumar.

01:24:10.294 --> 01:24:12.854
# The hotter the intensity #

01:24:14.165 --> 01:24:15.894
It's not all your fault.

01:24:16.901 --> 01:24:19.893
Yeah, it is. I brought weed on the plane.

01:24:19.937 --> 01:24:23.065
- You got weed?
- No. The other plane.

01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:30.108
No, I wish Neil Patrick Harris
were still alive, that guy fucking loves him.

01:24:30.148 --> 01:24:32.912
He totally would have
been able to bail us out.

01:24:34.252 --> 01:24:35.651
You just gave me an idea, man.

01:24:36.888 --> 01:24:38.287
- What?
- I got this.

01:24:40.224 --> 01:24:42.021
Hey, Burl...

01:24:42.059 --> 01:24:45.085
- I actually still have some weed.
- You do?

01:24:45.129 --> 01:24:47.757
- Seriously?
- Yeah. It's in my pants.

01:24:47.799 --> 01:24:49.824
- Hold up.
- You want to smoke now?

01:24:49.867 --> 01:24:51.027
Just let me...

01:24:51.068 --> 01:24:52.296
- Harold, this is definitely not...
...get it.

01:24:52.336 --> 01:24:53.325
...the time to smoke.

01:24:56.541 --> 01:25:01.410
# Highway to the danger zone #

01:25:02.146 --> 01:25:06.606
# Gonna take you
right into the danger zone #

01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:14.749
# Highway to the danger zone #

01:25:16.527 --> 01:25:18.358
Dude, you took Neil's Mace?

01:25:18.396 --> 01:25:20.762
Been through a lot of shit,
figured we might need it.

01:25:20.798 --> 01:25:21.787
Well, good call.

01:25:25.837 --> 01:25:28.271
Derek, can I get another water?

01:25:28.306 --> 01:25:30.433
What the fuck?

01:25:32.343 --> 01:25:34.243
- Keep your hands up.
- Please don't shoot us.

01:25:34.278 --> 01:25:36.508
- Jesus Christ. OK, OK.
- Please don't shoot.

01:25:36.547 --> 01:25:40.643
It will be a cold day in hell
before I let you hijack this plane.

01:25:44.555 --> 01:25:46.523
Beecher, what are you doing?

01:25:46.557 --> 01:25:49.151
Whose side are you on? I thought
I told you to stay in the cockpit!

01:25:49.193 --> 01:25:51.991
Enough, Fox!
I've had enough of your crap!

01:25:52.029 --> 01:25:53.553
You think that just because I'm smart...

01:25:53.598 --> 01:25:57.034
you can treat me
like some dork in gym class?

01:25:57.068 --> 01:26:00.868
It's obvious these kids are innocent.
But you're too dumb to realize that.

01:26:00.905 --> 01:26:03.669
You know, it's people like you...

01:26:03.708 --> 01:26:05.972
who make the world think
that Americans are stupid!

01:26:06.010 --> 01:26:10.538
Well, we're not stupid! And we're not
gonna take this shit anymore!

01:26:12.683 --> 01:26:14.708
It's OK, guys.

01:26:14.752 --> 01:26:16.151
It's all over now.

01:26:16.954 --> 01:26:19.047
Everything's gonna be all right.

01:26:23.861 --> 01:26:25.123
Jesus!

01:26:30.101 --> 01:26:31.500
Fuck!

01:26:32.570 --> 01:26:34.504
I don't wanna die!

01:26:34.539 --> 01:26:35.733
Kumar!

01:26:35.773 --> 01:26:38.401
- What?
- I have the parachute!

01:26:38.442 --> 01:26:39.773
Come over here.

01:26:39.810 --> 01:26:42.540
How the fuck am I supposed to do that?

01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:44.070
Swim!

01:26:51.489 --> 01:26:52.956
Holy shit.

01:26:52.990 --> 01:26:55.083
It's fucking working!

01:26:59.764 --> 01:27:01.732
Yeah!

01:27:03.067 --> 01:27:04.932
I love you, dude.

01:27:09.006 --> 01:27:10.769
Shit!

01:27:12.443 --> 01:27:14.877
Don't worry about him. I have an idea.

01:27:14.912 --> 01:27:17.210
- What?
- Hang on.

01:27:22.753 --> 01:27:24.721
Fuck you!

01:27:28.659 --> 01:27:31.457
Man, that was so fuckin' extreme.

01:27:32.863 --> 01:27:35.058
It was.

01:27:37.501 --> 01:27:39.196
- Kumar?
- Yeah.

01:27:41.606 --> 01:27:43.403
Our dicks are touching, aren't they?

01:27:44.909 --> 01:27:47.070
Yeah, I guess they are.

01:27:47.111 --> 01:27:49.409
- Yeah.
- OK, I was just checking.

01:27:50.548 --> 01:27:54.484
Roldy, can you move us out of the way?
There's a house coming up down here.

01:27:55.620 --> 01:27:58.316
I have no idea what I'm doing.

01:28:05.630 --> 01:28:06.790
Dude!

01:28:09.567 --> 01:28:13.401
The glass hurt my dick.
The glass hurt my dick.

01:28:15.473 --> 01:28:17.441
I think I'm OK. Yeah.

01:28:18.509 --> 01:28:20.841
- Dude. Dude.
- Oh, my God.

01:28:20.878 --> 01:28:23.642
- No, shit, dude. You all right?
- Fuck! I think so!

01:28:23.681 --> 01:28:25.945
We gotta get out of here before
the people who live here find us.

01:28:25.983 --> 01:28:27.610
I know. They're gonna be...

01:28:29.220 --> 01:28:31.313
Dude? Dude?

01:28:31.355 --> 01:28:32.686
What's up?

01:28:37.728 --> 01:28:39.855
- No.
- Holy shit!

01:28:39.897 --> 01:28:42.832
What the hell are y'all
doing in my office?

01:28:44.068 --> 01:28:46.593
You'd better start giving me
some answers!

01:28:46.637 --> 01:28:48.764
George?
We're gonna be late for that wedding.

01:28:48.806 --> 01:28:52.173
Shit. It's Cheney. Come on, you guys.
Keep quiet. Follow me.

01:28:52.209 --> 01:28:55.542
That guy scares the crap out of me.
Let's go hide in the guesthouse.

01:28:55.579 --> 01:28:58.343
- Come the fuck on.
- I'm coming.

01:29:15.666 --> 01:29:17.566
# Yeah #

01:29:18.736 --> 01:29:21.796
- This is a cool room.
- Yeah.

01:29:21.839 --> 01:29:25.570
Yeah, this is where
I come to escape from work.

01:29:25.609 --> 01:29:28.271
- Here?
- Yes, sir.

01:29:29.747 --> 01:29:32.841
- So who the heck are you guys?
- All right.

01:29:32.883 --> 01:29:34.578
My name is Harold Lee, sir...

01:29:34.618 --> 01:29:36.210
and this is Kumar Patel.

01:29:38.022 --> 01:29:42.220
Anyway, we were on a parachute
and we sort of landed on your ranch.

01:29:42.259 --> 01:29:43.920
Dude, this is weed.

01:29:44.829 --> 01:29:46.490
That's Alabama Kush.

01:29:46.530 --> 01:29:47.792
That's only the finest.

01:29:47.832 --> 01:29:50.528
So you get high and then you put
other people who smoke weed in jail?

01:29:51.769 --> 01:29:53.066
- That's so hypocritical.
- Dude, look...

01:29:53.104 --> 01:29:55.971
Yeah? Well, let me ask you
something, Kumar.

01:29:56.006 --> 01:29:58.566
- You like giving hand jobs?
- No, sir.

01:29:58.609 --> 01:30:01.305
- You like getting hand jobs?
- Yeah.

01:30:01.345 --> 01:30:04.439
All right. Well, that makes you
a fucking hypocriticizer too.

01:30:04.482 --> 01:30:07.815
So shut the fuck up
and smoke my weed.

01:30:24.869 --> 01:30:25.858
Hey, love.

01:30:25.903 --> 01:30:30.340
What are you doing here? It's bad luck.
The ceremony starts in a hour.

01:30:30.374 --> 01:30:32.171
I just want to let you know...

01:30:32.209 --> 01:30:34.302
I had catering get an extra case
of Coors Light...

01:30:34.345 --> 01:30:35.334
in case the President comes.

01:30:35.379 --> 01:30:36.710
It's his favorite beer.

01:30:36.747 --> 01:30:39.682
- Do you think that'll be enough?
- I don't know. Yes?

01:30:39.717 --> 01:30:41.446
Who cares?

01:30:42.419 --> 01:30:46.480
Look, were you able to work
everything out with Kumar and Harold?

01:30:46.524 --> 01:30:49.857
Don't worry, Chestnut.
I took complete care of 'em.

01:30:58.135 --> 01:31:00.797
They thought you guys were terrorizers.

01:31:01.372 --> 01:31:05.069
Wait. That's not funny, man.
They sent us to Guantánamo Bay.

01:31:05.109 --> 01:31:07.839
Fuck! G. Bay?

01:31:08.546 --> 01:31:10.605
Tell me you didn't eat
that cockmeat sandwich.

01:31:11.849 --> 01:31:16.081
No. No, we did not eat the cockmeat
sandwich. We escaped, thank God.

01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:19.521
That cockmeat sandwich.
That's my favorite.

01:31:19.557 --> 01:31:20.751
Oh, my God.

01:31:22.326 --> 01:31:24.988
- This is good shit.
- I know. I know.

01:31:25.029 --> 01:31:26.997
- I laced it with blow.
- Fuck.

01:31:27.031 --> 01:31:29.829
So it knocks you out, and it keeps you
going at the same time.

01:31:31.368 --> 01:31:34.667
If you like weed so much,
why don't you just legalize it?

01:31:34.705 --> 01:31:36.866
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:31:36.907 --> 01:31:39.933
You know how pissed off
my dad would get if I did that?

01:31:39.977 --> 01:31:42.241
Holy shit, dude.

01:31:42.279 --> 01:31:44.577
My dad's all up in my shit too,
about this whole...

01:31:44.615 --> 01:31:45.604
- med school thing, right?
- I know.

01:31:45.649 --> 01:31:47.913
And it's not that I don't
want to be a doctor, but like...

01:31:48.385 --> 01:31:51.513
fucking... sometimes I wonder
if he's just encouraging me...

01:31:51.555 --> 01:31:53.045
because he knows it'll make me happy...

01:31:53.090 --> 01:31:57.049
or because he wants me
to carry on his legacy, you know?

01:31:58.128 --> 01:32:00.187
You just blew my fuckin' mind.

01:32:11.342 --> 01:32:13.936
- Hi.
- Hi. You look good.

01:32:13.978 --> 01:32:15.969
Daddy.

01:32:16.013 --> 01:32:17.640
Yeah, it's W.

01:32:19.516 --> 01:32:21.950
I don't need your friends
to tell me what to do anymore.

01:32:23.621 --> 01:32:26.283
- No, I'm not being disrespectful.
- That's what I say.

01:32:26.323 --> 01:32:29.258
I'm just saying that
I can handle my own shit, all right?

01:32:29.293 --> 01:32:32.228
I mean, I don't need them to tell me
how to do what I have to do.

01:32:32.263 --> 01:32:34.128
Yeah, dude!

01:32:34.164 --> 01:32:36.962
Yeah, well you know what?
Yeah, well, fuck you, Dad.

01:32:37.001 --> 01:32:39.094
Fuck you!

01:32:41.839 --> 01:32:44.137
- Dude, that was awesome.
- You guys are awesome.

01:32:44.174 --> 01:32:45.163
- No. No.
- You're awesome!

01:32:45.209 --> 01:32:47.837
- You are awesomer.
- Sir, you are awesome.

01:32:47.878 --> 01:32:49.345
Seriously.

01:32:49.380 --> 01:32:52.178
Listen, about our situation...

01:32:52.216 --> 01:32:56.744
Fuck that. Listen, guys, guys, guys.
I am the fucking President, all right?

01:32:56.787 --> 01:32:59.517
That means I get to pardon whoever
I want. You guys are in the fuckin' clear.

01:32:59.556 --> 01:33:00.614
Don't worry.

01:33:00.658 --> 01:33:04.788
- Holy shit. Are you serious? Thank you.
- Oh, my God. Thank you, Mr. President.

01:33:04.828 --> 01:33:05.852
Yeah.

01:33:05.896 --> 01:33:09.161
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:13.964
But, listen, to be honest, after
all the shit that we've been through...

01:33:14.004 --> 01:33:17.997
I don't know if we can trust
our government anymore.

01:33:18.042 --> 01:33:20.101
- Trust the government?
- Yeah.

01:33:20.144 --> 01:33:23.045
Heck. I'm in the government
and I don't even trust it.

01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:27.483
You don't have to believe in your
government to be a good American.

01:33:31.588 --> 01:33:33.852
You just have to believe in your country.

01:33:34.625 --> 01:33:36.115
Exactly.

01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:38.492
- Exactly.
- Right.

01:33:38.529 --> 01:33:40.190
This is good shit, isn't it?

01:33:41.865 --> 01:33:43.560
Yeah, it is.

01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:47.127
If you guys need anything else,
just let me know, all right?

01:33:47.171 --> 01:33:50.629
Actually, Mr. President,
there is one thing.

01:33:52.676 --> 01:33:55.201
- This really came out great.
- Yeah, it did, man.

01:33:55.245 --> 01:33:56.974
I lit a lot of these candles.

01:34:10.427 --> 01:34:11.985
Great.

01:34:14.298 --> 01:34:16.528
- All clear.
- Safe to proceed.

01:34:17.901 --> 01:34:19.766
He's here! I knew he'd come.

01:34:24.141 --> 01:34:25.574
All right, let 'em in.

01:34:29.947 --> 01:34:31.608
- What is happen...
- Who is that?

01:34:31.648 --> 01:34:34.276
- Harold?
- Kumar?

01:34:34.318 --> 01:34:38.550
Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize
for interrupting this beautiful ceremony.

01:34:38.589 --> 01:34:40.318
But there is no way in hell...

01:34:40.357 --> 01:34:43.258
that I'm letting the only woman
I've ever loved marry that piece of shit.

01:34:45.062 --> 01:34:47.496
Security, get them out of here, please.

01:34:47.531 --> 01:34:51.058
These guys?
No, see, they're with us. Yeah.

01:34:51.101 --> 01:34:54.093
Looks like I got a little more pull
with the President than you, bitch.

01:34:57.174 --> 01:35:00.268
- What the hell is going on?
- I'll tell you what's going on.

01:35:00.310 --> 01:35:02.904
Your fiancé promised
to get us out of trouble.

01:35:02.946 --> 01:35:06.746
But instead he arranged for us
to be sent back to Guantánamo Bay...

01:35:06.784 --> 01:35:10.220
where we'd be forced
to suck Big Bob's fat dick.

01:35:13.424 --> 01:35:15.551
- Is this true?
- Yeah, it's true.

01:35:15.592 --> 01:35:17.321
I'll take care of this myself.

01:35:19.797 --> 01:35:20.889
- OK, wait.
- No...

01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:24.767
You son of a bitch.

01:35:26.603 --> 01:35:28.127
I loved you, man.

01:35:32.209 --> 01:35:34.769
- I can't believe this.
- Vanessa, let me explain...

01:35:34.812 --> 01:35:36.712
Explain?

01:35:36.747 --> 01:35:38.112
Explain why you're putting me through...

01:35:38.148 --> 01:35:40.514
the most embarrassing moment
of my life?

01:35:42.019 --> 01:35:47.116
Well, what if I did
something embarrassing to myself?

01:35:47.157 --> 01:35:48.181
Would that make you feel better?

01:35:48.225 --> 01:35:50.955
There's nothing you can do
that would be this embarrassing.

01:35:55.499 --> 01:35:59.902
I fear that I will always be
A lonely number like root three

01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:05.731
A three is all that's good and right

01:36:05.776 --> 01:36:10.145
Why must my three keep out of sight
Beneath a vicious square-root sign?

01:36:10.180 --> 01:36:11.875
I wish instead I were a nine

01:36:11.915 --> 01:36:15.646
For nine could thwart this evil trick
With just some quick arithmetic

01:36:16.887 --> 01:36:18.377
I know I'll never see the sun

01:36:18.422 --> 01:36:20.322
As 1.7321

01:36:20.357 --> 01:36:22.552
You fucking tool.

01:36:22.593 --> 01:36:24.823
Quiet, anus.

01:36:27.397 --> 01:36:31.390
Such is my reality
A sad irrationality

01:36:31.435 --> 01:36:33.995
When, hark, just what is this I see?

01:36:34.838 --> 01:36:36.829
Another square root of a three

01:36:36.874 --> 01:36:39.468
Has quietly come waltzing by

01:36:39.510 --> 01:36:41.239
Together now we multiply

01:36:41.278 --> 01:36:43.803
To form a number we prefer

01:36:43.847 --> 01:36:45.838
Rejoicing as an integer

01:36:47.251 --> 01:36:49.185
We break free from our mortal bonds

01:36:49.219 --> 01:36:51.084
And with a wave of magic wands

01:36:51.121 --> 01:36:53.521
Our square-root signs become unglued

01:36:53.557 --> 01:36:55.821
And love for me has been renewed

01:37:04.935 --> 01:37:06.732
You were right.

01:37:06.770 --> 01:37:09.568
- That was pretty lame.
- Told you.

01:37:10.941 --> 01:37:15.708
Look, I can't promise you
the kind of lifestyle that Colton could.

01:37:15.746 --> 01:37:18.544
And I can't promise you
that I'm gonna mature overnight.

01:37:18.582 --> 01:37:21.016
But what I can promise you is that...

01:37:27.391 --> 01:37:29.120
Sorry, I smoked weed
with the President.

01:37:29.159 --> 01:37:30.990
I totally forgot
what I was going to say.

01:37:33.497 --> 01:37:36.125
I can promise you
that I will always love you.

01:37:36.166 --> 01:37:39.101
And I'll never try and make you
into something that you're not.

01:37:40.437 --> 01:37:44.703
So, what do you say
you take a brother back?

01:37:50.447 --> 01:37:52.506
Only if you promise to get me
out of this awkward situation...

01:37:52.549 --> 01:37:53.573
as soon as possible.

01:37:54.618 --> 01:37:55.710
Come here.

01:37:59.156 --> 01:38:00.748
Yeah!

01:38:05.195 --> 01:38:07.288
That's my boy!

01:38:07.331 --> 01:38:08.559
Ku!

01:38:14.871 --> 01:38:16.736
Come on.
Let's get the hell back to Jersey.

01:38:16.773 --> 01:38:20.209
All right, hold on. First we gotta
do something for my buddy here.

01:38:20.244 --> 01:38:22.144
- Got to go somewhere.
- Where?

01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:27.414
# Ooh, baby, do you know
what that's worth? #

01:38:27.451 --> 01:38:31.114
# Ooh, heaven is a place on earth #

01:38:31.154 --> 01:38:35.318
# They say in heaven love comes first #

01:38:35.359 --> 01:38:39.159
# We'll make heaven a place on earth #

01:38:39.196 --> 01:38:43.326
# Ooh, heaven is a place on earth #

01:38:54.311 --> 01:38:55.938
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:38:57.581 --> 01:38:59.481
- No luck, huh?
- No.

01:39:01.351 --> 01:39:04.184
Called every hotel in the city.
I walked all around.

01:39:04.888 --> 01:39:06.287
I just can't find her anywhere.

01:39:06.323 --> 01:39:07.790
- We'll find her.
- We'll find her, dude.

01:39:12.963 --> 01:39:14.624
What?

01:39:14.665 --> 01:39:16.792
Oh, my God, there she is.

01:39:21.471 --> 01:39:23.837
- Roldy, she's hot.
- Dude, go get her!

01:39:29.546 --> 01:39:32.606
Jesus, I'm sorry, man.

01:39:32.649 --> 01:39:34.014
- So fuck it. Forget about that.
- Yeah.

01:39:34.051 --> 01:39:35.575
It's probably
just some Amsterdam fling, all right?

01:39:35.619 --> 01:39:36.677
We'll go back to the Jerz...

01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:38.517
- in a couple of days, all right?
- No.

01:39:39.790 --> 01:39:42.258
No, fuck it.

01:39:42.292 --> 01:39:43.589
I came way too far.

01:39:43.627 --> 01:39:45.219
We went through too much shit to...

01:39:45.262 --> 01:39:46.695
I'm gonna talk to her.

01:39:46.730 --> 01:39:47.822
No, no, no, dude, don't go in there.

01:39:47.864 --> 01:39:48.990
- Come on.
- Just wait.

01:39:49.032 --> 01:39:50.829
Come on, man.
Wait till we get back to Jersey.

01:39:52.436 --> 01:39:53.562
What the fuck are you doing?

01:39:53.603 --> 01:39:56.094
- <i>C'est quoi ton putain de problème, toi?</i>
- Harold!

01:39:56.139 --> 01:39:58.004
I didn't understand what you said.

01:39:58.041 --> 01:40:00.737
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What the fuck are you doing, man?

01:40:00.777 --> 01:40:03.405
- You're ruining my shot.
- You what?

01:40:03.447 --> 01:40:05.506
Get off my set!

01:40:05.549 --> 01:40:07.449
I'm so confused. What's...

01:40:07.484 --> 01:40:09.850
- What's going on?
- Harold, I'm doing a photo shoot.

01:40:10.787 --> 01:40:12.379
For <i>High Times</i> magazine.

01:40:13.490 --> 01:40:17.187
Of course, you're a model.
You're very hot. You're a model.

01:40:17.227 --> 01:40:19.422
Right. I always wondered
what you did for a living.

01:40:19.463 --> 01:40:22.364
I'm sorry. So, wait a second.
So you're not with this dude?

01:40:22.399 --> 01:40:24.162
Are you kidding? Me?

01:40:24.201 --> 01:40:26.533
- Yeah.
- No.

01:40:26.570 --> 01:40:28.936
Anton is like totally gay.

01:40:34.811 --> 01:40:36.938
Harold, what are you doing here?

01:40:38.081 --> 01:40:39.810
I didn't want to wait ten days
to see you...

01:40:39.850 --> 01:40:42.375
so I thought
I would come and surprise you.

01:40:43.987 --> 01:40:46.114
That is so sweet.

01:40:46.156 --> 01:40:48.090
OK. It's sweet.

01:40:48.125 --> 01:40:51.060
I've been thinking about you
this whole time.

01:40:51.094 --> 01:40:52.584
- You have?
- I have.

01:40:52.629 --> 01:40:56.121
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you.

01:41:10.013 --> 01:41:11.640
Fuck yeah, dude.

01:41:11.681 --> 01:41:13.979
Bang bang, Roldy.

01:41:15.352 --> 01:41:17.479
Hello, Maria. My name is Kumar.

01:41:17.521 --> 01:41:19.455
- I've heard so much about you.
- Hi.

01:41:19.489 --> 01:41:20.751
This is Vanessa. Vanessa, Maria.

01:41:20.791 --> 01:41:22.486
- Hey.
- Hey. How you doing?

01:41:22.526 --> 01:41:26.223
Ladies and Roldy, how would you
like to get really fucking high...

01:41:26.263 --> 01:41:28.060
since we're in Amsterdam?

01:41:28.098 --> 01:41:29.292
- Yeah.
- Shall we?

01:41:29.332 --> 01:41:32.324
- Sounds like a plan.
- Let's do it.

01:41:32.369 --> 01:41:35.532
# So in the beginning
there was hum from a poet #

01:41:35.572 --> 01:41:37.767
# Whose pulse felt drum, drum, drum #

01:41:37.808 --> 01:41:39.241
# He would perform praise and all #

01:41:39.276 --> 01:41:42.109
# Till one day he heard a voice call
come, come, come #

01:41:42.145 --> 01:41:44.443
# Suspicious, he moved,
it was his cost #

01:41:44.481 --> 01:41:47.075
# His missus he thinks
is a little lost #

01:41:47.117 --> 01:41:50.780
# People get held back
by the voice inside 'em #

01:41:50.821 --> 01:41:53.813
# Yeah, the voice said
the voices speak inside you #

01:41:53.857 --> 01:42:00.160
# Rejoice and please let me invite you
to evil, greed and lies too #

01:42:00.197 --> 01:42:02.290
# Yeah, confusing days,
he moved aways #

01:42:02.332 --> 01:42:04.857
- # He soon became #
- # Boom boom boom #

01:42:04.901 --> 01:42:07.426
# A knock on his door,
his heart is no more #

01:42:07.471 --> 01:42:10.338
# A knock on his door,
his soul is no more #

01:42:12.609 --> 01:42:14.304
# Yeah #

01:42:16.913 --> 01:42:18.676
# That was in the beginning #

01:42:18.715 --> 01:42:20.945
# The cops beat him
when all he wants is his freedom #

01:42:20.984 --> 01:42:23.316
# So they defeat him,
whatever spirit he's got, beat him #

01:42:23.353 --> 01:42:25.378
# And they teach him the rest of the world
don't need him #

01:42:25.422 --> 01:42:28.016
# And he believes the disease
that he's heathen #

01:42:28.058 --> 01:42:30.185
# Put up your fists
if all you want is freedom #

01:42:30.227 --> 01:42:32.252
# Put up your fists if all you want is #

01:42:37.868 --> 01:42:39.665
# That was in the beginning #

01:42:42.873 --> 01:42:44.670
# And things change #

01:42:48.812 --> 01:42:50.473
# Yeah, yeah, yeah #

01:42:50.514 --> 01:42:54.507
# We keep holding on
and we keep being strong #

01:42:54.551 --> 01:42:58.885
# And we keep going on,
and on and on and on #

01:42:58.922 --> 01:43:03.450
# And we keep holding on
and we keep being strong #

01:43:03.493 --> 01:43:08.123
# And we keep going on
and on and on and on #

01:43:08.164 --> 01:43:12.624
# And we keep holding on
and we keep being strong #

01:43:12.669 --> 01:43:17.231
# And we keep going on
and on and on and on #

01:43:17.274 --> 01:43:21.643
# And we keep holding on
and we keep being strong #

01:43:21.678 --> 01:43:26.172
# And we keep going on
and on and on and on #

01:43:27.617 --> 01:43:30.484
- # Brothers and sisters #
- # Yeah #

01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:33.683
- # We're gonna have church tonight #
- # Yeah, yeah! #

01:43:33.723 --> 01:43:37.682
# And tonight this speaker
is Reverend Rufus Johnson #

01:43:37.727 --> 01:43:41.424
# I wake up praising God every day #

01:43:41.464 --> 01:43:46.401
# I wanna smoke some weed
and roll me a J #

01:43:46.436 --> 01:43:48.996
- # Thank you, Jesus #
- # Thank you, Jesus #

01:43:49.039 --> 01:43:52.770
- # Thank you, Lord #
- # Thank you, Lord #

01:43:52.809 --> 01:43:57.610
# For lettin' me live another day, hey, hey #

01:43:57.647 --> 01:43:59.911
- # Nigger, I'm high, nigger, you high #
- # Uh-huh #

01:43:59.950 --> 01:44:02.714
# Let's get higher than
the motherfucking sky #

01:44:02.752 --> 01:44:05.016
# Watch the butterflies hit the wall #

01:44:05.055 --> 01:44:07.717
# And if you're feeling down
give your boy a call #

01:44:07.757 --> 01:44:12.660
# Weed, it takes the stress away, that's
why Bizarre smokes ten blunts a day #

01:44:12.696 --> 01:44:15.426
# It's nothing
but the sticky, icky, green stuff #

01:44:15.465 --> 01:44:17.831
# Light it, pass it and take a puff #

01:44:17.867 --> 01:44:20.301
# Having a bad day, stop by my house #

01:44:20.337 --> 01:44:22.862
# 'Cause most likely
I got a blunt in my mouth #
