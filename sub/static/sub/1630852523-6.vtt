WEBVTT

00:15.265 --> 00:16.349
Hi!

00:22.731 --> 00:24.816
I'm teaching Chase
how to drive for the vlog.

00:24.899 --> 00:27.569
I have never driven a car!

00:32.574 --> 00:35.869
I think the one thing that set
Hype House apart from the beginning

00:35.952 --> 00:37.871
is that we're all like a family.

00:37.954 --> 00:41.166
And it was such a blast
to bring people together

00:41.249 --> 00:43.334
and just have fun every day
with our friends.

00:51.801 --> 00:52.844
I'm so tired.

00:52.927 --> 00:54.929
I didn't sleep well at all.

00:57.265 --> 00:59.976
I kept waking up
'cause I didn't want to hit your foot.

01:00.977 --> 01:03.063
What sets the Hype House apart

01:03.146 --> 01:06.733
is we kind of pioneered
the TikTok house collaborative idea.

01:06.816 --> 01:08.610
The thought process
behind Hype House

01:08.693 --> 01:10.445
was creators collaborating consistently

01:10.528 --> 01:14.991
because people don't like single creators,
they want groups and friends.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.285
-What are you doing?
-Making sticks.

01:17.368 --> 01:20.955
-That's a non-stick pan.
-It's a sticky situation then.

01:22.082 --> 01:26.669
It was the most collaborative environment.
It was so fun creating content every day.

01:27.253 --> 01:29.130
And now times have changed.

01:33.968 --> 01:37.222


01:37.305 --> 01:39.933


01:40.016 --> 01:43.269
These last couple months
we haven't done much together.

01:43.353 --> 01:46.981
We're all doing our own thing,
but I miss my friends, and it's not easy.

01:48.441 --> 01:49.275
Hey, puppies.

01:49.359 --> 01:51.528
Hype House is the most
talked about thing on TikTok.

01:56.908 --> 02:02.330
We used to be super close and now, like,
I haven't posted with Hype House at all.

02:06.751 --> 02:08.336
I don't know…

02:08.419 --> 02:11.047
I just feel like
I need to bring everyone together,

02:11.131 --> 02:14.217
but sadly I don't know how to do that.

02:26.104 --> 02:27.981
What is this?
Are we making fajitas?

02:28.064 --> 02:30.108
I don't know what we're making
but look at this.

02:30.191 --> 02:31.693
Who's our guests, and what's happening?

02:31.776 --> 02:34.237
I invited Mackenzie,
Billy, Vinnie, and Brady.

02:34.320 --> 02:37.323
I invited them because
I want to step out of our comfort zone.

02:37.407 --> 02:39.159
We are not good at making friends.

02:39.242 --> 02:41.202
-Only, like…
-Girls and gays.

02:41.286 --> 02:44.622
They gonna be shook. Vinnie gonna
walk in here like, "Yo, y'all cooking?"

02:44.706 --> 02:46.374
Who's cooking? Chipotle?

02:47.458 --> 02:49.210
So we're not doing cute presentation?

02:49.294 --> 02:51.421
You not gonna clean no dishes,
I know that.

02:51.504 --> 02:52.922
You are gonna make this mess--

02:53.006 --> 02:55.884
We have a maid on Tuesdays.
It's Monday, she'll come tomorrow.

02:55.967 --> 02:58.970
-Your white privilege is showing.
-Your white privilege is showing.

02:59.053 --> 03:02.807
You know, after hanging out with y'all,
I've realized a lot about myself.

03:02.891 --> 03:06.186
-And it's that I'm homophobic.
-Back off. Don't touch me.

03:06.269 --> 03:08.855
-Shorty.
-Don't touch me. Why are you in my grill?

03:08.938 --> 03:11.900
-Wanna go to prom together?
-Honestly, this is so not on the tape.

03:11.983 --> 03:14.903
-Billy!
-Hi, babe!

03:14.986 --> 03:16.571
Welcome to our humble abode.

03:16.654 --> 03:18.573
-How are you?
-Good, how are you?

03:19.908 --> 03:21.993
Hi!

03:22.076 --> 03:23.703
-Hey.
-Should we play <i>Bed Wars?</i>

03:23.786 --> 03:25.830
Let's play <i>Bed Wars!</i>

03:25.914 --> 03:29.000
-I haven't seen y'all in so long.
-Didn't we slay?

03:29.083 --> 03:30.919
-Hey!
-Hey, Vincent.

03:31.002 --> 03:32.837
-Hey, Vinnie.
-How are you guys?

03:32.921 --> 03:33.880
-Hey.
-Hello.

03:33.963 --> 03:37.383
Vinnie and me have the same humor,
not to mention we're the same signs,

03:37.467 --> 03:38.968
so we get each other mentally.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.596
And we both watch anime so, like,

03:41.679 --> 03:44.766
he's one of the few people
in the Hype House who understands me.

03:44.849 --> 03:46.684
Vinnie, at your big mansion thing…

03:46.768 --> 03:48.228
-Yeah?
-What do you cook?

03:48.311 --> 03:49.854
Steak, chicken.

03:49.938 --> 03:53.691
Like carbs. Big man.
Big Vinnie eat. Vinnie eat big meal.

03:53.775 --> 03:57.654
And also when he was announced to join,
he got the same amount of hate as I did.

03:57.737 --> 03:58.905
So we're like brothers.

03:58.988 --> 04:00.531
Woo!

04:00.615 --> 04:02.825
Hype House hate train, let's go!

04:03.409 --> 04:04.619
How's Hype House?

04:04.702 --> 04:10.083
It's good, I'm super freaking busy
so I can't spend all my time with them.

04:10.166 --> 04:12.585
That's true.
Do you feel more productive?

04:12.669 --> 04:17.173
Yeah, way more productive.
Michael obviously doesn't think I am.

04:17.257 --> 04:20.760
-I don't know about that.
-Why don't you come to Hype House anymore?

04:21.344 --> 04:24.472
-It's so far.
-I mean, that is a valid reason.

04:24.555 --> 04:26.975
And when I do go over you're in your room.

04:27.058 --> 04:30.478
-You can tell me you're coming.
-You're always streaming.

04:30.561 --> 04:33.439
But no, it's honestly far
and it's not as fun.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.191
It's not as fun? Am I not fun?

04:35.275 --> 04:39.988
Because everyone's doing their own thing
and it's like the vibes don't hit.

04:40.071 --> 04:41.197
There's no vibes, bruh.

04:41.281 --> 04:46.160
It's more of, like-- Hype House now
is more of, like, a business house.

04:46.244 --> 04:49.163
Larray, if you were there
you'd bring the energy up.

04:49.247 --> 04:51.582
-And they'd love it if you came too.
-Yeah.

04:52.166 --> 04:55.753
Since everyone started
doing their own thing it's not as fun.

04:55.837 --> 04:59.132
It's so much better when
everyone's combined and living together.

04:59.215 --> 05:02.260
Rather than going to Thomas'
then Chase's. It sucks.

05:03.094 --> 05:04.929
What's the UV? I'm trying to get tan.

05:05.013 --> 05:07.348
Wait, how is this enjoyable for anyone?

05:07.432 --> 05:09.434
Dogs, I swear to God…

05:11.019 --> 05:14.022


05:20.737 --> 05:21.654


05:22.280 --> 05:23.781
Hi! Come 'ere.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.285
Oh! He has a boner.

05:27.368 --> 05:28.661
Yeah, that's normal.

05:29.203 --> 05:31.331
-There we go.
-He's just excited.

05:31.414 --> 05:32.540
I've been thinking.

05:32.623 --> 05:36.044
Ever since people moved,
they haven't made time to come over,

05:36.127 --> 05:38.629
but I feel like,
being in charge of the business,

05:38.713 --> 05:41.549
I should attempt
to bring everyone together.

05:41.632 --> 05:45.345
I was looking at places for, like,
us to potentially go on a trip to

05:45.428 --> 05:48.139
and there's this place called Hicksville.

05:48.890 --> 05:52.310
I know. It sounds great,
It's a place in Joshua Tree.

05:52.393 --> 05:54.812
-Desert!
-The desert.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.856
Here, I'll show you the place.

05:59.442 --> 06:01.694
-There's trailers.
-Oh, lovely.

06:02.695 --> 06:03.571
Yay.

06:04.155 --> 06:06.032
We'd get to share with Alex and Kouvr.

06:06.115 --> 06:07.909
I don't mind that part, but…

06:09.327 --> 06:12.038
You don't wanna sleep in a trailer
with our whole house?

06:12.121 --> 06:17.085
And Baron, Ryland, Chase, Larray, Ravon…?

06:17.668 --> 06:19.629
-Yay.

06:19.712 --> 06:22.507
I feel like it would be fun.
Bring everyone together,

06:22.590 --> 06:27.220
hang out, maybe film some stuff,
just kind of bring back the old vibes.

06:27.887 --> 06:31.099
Trips are always good.
They bring everyone's excitement back.

06:31.182 --> 06:34.894
When we went to the snow,
it was so nice to be somewhere different.

06:34.977 --> 06:39.107
We went to Lake Havasu,
we tried to do fun things to change it up.

06:39.190 --> 06:42.777
I wanna bring the two houses together,
enjoy each other's company again.

06:42.860 --> 06:45.655
-Isn't it so beautiful?
-Yeah…

06:45.738 --> 06:47.865
We're gonna stay in the New World.

06:48.449 --> 06:51.119
Going on a trip with everyone
would be nice

06:51.202 --> 06:54.372
because it would be a way
to connect with everyone and hang out.

06:54.455 --> 06:58.167
But I think the biggest thing for me
is to see Thomas happy

06:58.251 --> 07:00.211
and take a bit of stress off him.

07:00.294 --> 07:05.216
In all, I'm hoping this trip goes well
and everyone makes content and hangs out,

07:05.299 --> 07:06.926
so I can see him be happy.

07:07.009 --> 07:11.347
If we do our best to reach out,
be friendly, that makes me feel better.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.851
Like, being like, "I did what I could,"
even if it doesn't work out.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.039
Thank you.

07:37.123 --> 07:38.458
I'm gonna send a video.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.877
Yeah, guys,
I'll make it, I'll be there.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.420
I'm excited to make content.

07:45.590 --> 07:49.635
And with everything I'm going through,
this might be something I need.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.554
Going to Hicksville. Woo!

08:01.063 --> 08:03.608
Oh, baby. Dexter wants to see you.

08:05.693 --> 08:08.029
-Okay.
-Oh, he doesn't wanna see you.

08:09.071 --> 08:10.823
You have a depressed kitten.

08:10.907 --> 08:13.326
You have
a depressed boyfriend right now.

08:15.286 --> 08:18.206
I find myself really, really depressed.

08:19.624 --> 08:22.001
And I know it sounds so stupid,
it sounds so dumb,

08:22.084 --> 08:26.422
"20-year-old millionaire who's depressed,
what do you have to be depressed about?"

08:26.506 --> 08:30.843
And that's what I struggle with,
like I'm not allowed to be depressed.

08:30.927 --> 08:34.805
So I'm stuck in this circle
of anger and depression

08:34.889 --> 08:38.976
and then blowing it all off,
because I shouldn't feel that way.

08:39.560 --> 08:42.688
-Thank you for taking care of me today.
-Yeah.

08:44.232 --> 08:46.400
-My mom texted me this morning.
-Yeah?

08:46.484 --> 08:48.402
Not the greatest things.

08:52.990 --> 08:55.409
-I'm sorry.
-No, I'm not asking for pity.

08:55.493 --> 08:58.871
-I'm just keeping you updated.
-I know, but I feel bad.

08:58.955 --> 09:01.832
I don't like it when that happens.

09:01.916 --> 09:06.879
To put this all behind me,
dad dying, abusive, alcoholic mom,

09:06.963 --> 09:10.424
cops getting involved,
Child Protective Services involved.

09:10.508 --> 09:14.595
I always forget about,
you know… so much crap.

09:15.846 --> 09:18.266
Because it made me into who I am today.

09:19.559 --> 09:23.896
And what I've realized is,
it all just comes up at one point

09:25.898 --> 09:29.902
It's too much energy
to hold a grudge and hate something,

09:29.986 --> 09:34.365
opposed to…
trying to make it better yourself.

09:34.448 --> 09:38.244
Yeah. But I think
it's also mentally draining on you.

09:39.620 --> 09:40.454
Yeah.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.791
-No one can bully you except for me.

09:43.874 --> 09:45.167
So I don't like that.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.877
I definitely worry about Alex.

09:46.961 --> 09:49.046
His mental health,
his physical well being.

09:49.130 --> 09:51.882
I don't think
he's come to terms with everything.

09:51.966 --> 09:54.343
And I don't know how to help him.

09:54.427 --> 10:01.100
With everything that I've been through,
I hide behind a lot of jokes and comedy

10:01.183 --> 10:04.520
but it's really hard for me
to kind of open up and be serious,

10:05.896 --> 10:08.190
just 'cause, I don't know,
I've been doing it since…

10:08.983 --> 10:10.401
since I can remember.

10:10.484 --> 10:11.485
I know.

10:11.569 --> 10:13.821
-I'm scared of how I really feel.
-Why?

10:14.739 --> 10:17.283
-Like--
-I've been disappointed my entire life.

10:17.366 --> 10:19.744
You're the first thing
that hasn't disappointed me.

10:19.827 --> 10:21.829
Well, that's sweet. I love you.

10:22.371 --> 10:23.289
I love you too.

10:23.372 --> 10:28.044
You just do a lot for me,
and I feel like I don't say enough of it.

10:28.127 --> 10:31.839
-I just like being there for you.
-I like having you there for me.

10:32.423 --> 10:33.507
I have a shoulder.

10:34.884 --> 10:35.760
This one.

10:35.843 --> 10:37.553
-I have two shoulders.
-No.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.306
Oh, lean on it. Got it.

10:40.389 --> 10:42.600
I missed that one. It was good.

10:42.683 --> 10:45.019
-I figured it out after, though.
-Mm-hmm.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.069


10:53.152 --> 10:55.821


10:55.905 --> 10:59.283
-We need some girls.
-We need some shorties.

10:59.367 --> 11:00.951
Ryland, what's your type?

11:01.035 --> 11:03.245
I like outgoing beach girls,
I'm not gonna lie.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.998
We know who Baron's into,
he's into dancers.

11:06.082 --> 11:10.753
I like females with a nice sense of style.

11:10.836 --> 11:12.421
You do appreciate the style a lot.

11:12.505 --> 11:16.175
And if she can dance,
that's always cool, that's a plus.

11:16.258 --> 11:18.552
-What about you, lion?

11:18.636 --> 11:19.804
Not much.

11:24.517 --> 11:28.854
Hey, being single has helped me
produce and write a great album.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.361
But I haven't met anyone
in my life recently.

11:35.945 --> 11:38.197
I have you guys, I don't need anyone.

11:42.743 --> 11:44.495
-Nikita!
-<i>Can you hear me?</i>

11:44.578 --> 11:45.788
Yeah, we're in the tub.

11:45.871 --> 11:47.957
<i>Wait, who's in the hot tub with you?</i>

11:48.040 --> 11:50.418
-Lil Huddy and Barone.
-Not me.

11:50.501 --> 11:52.586
<i>And how far are you guys</i>
<i>apart from each other?</i>

11:52.670 --> 11:53.504
We're separate.

11:53.587 --> 11:56.257
-Five feet apart!
-We're on opposite sides of the tub.

11:56.340 --> 11:58.467
-We're in a pandemic--
-<i>Not on opposite sides!</i>

11:58.551 --> 12:00.511
-We're in a pandemic.

12:00.594 --> 12:03.180
<i>Well, I guess it's perfect</i>
<i>that you guys are all together</i>

12:03.264 --> 12:05.891
<i>because I hope you didn't forget</i>
<i>about our get together.</i>

12:05.975 --> 12:08.769
-We might make an appearance.
-Who set it up?

12:08.853 --> 12:09.854
<i>Thomas and Mia.</i>

12:12.231 --> 12:15.401
I'm scared of Thomas
and to ask him if I could stay with y'all.

12:15.484 --> 12:19.739
The way Thomas approaches things,
I get the intimidation with most people.

12:24.326 --> 12:26.036
But he's just full of ideas.

12:26.120 --> 12:31.208
So you have to take the time to listen,
which most people don't give him.

12:31.292 --> 12:33.169
-Who's going?
-<i>Everybody.</i>

12:33.252 --> 12:35.755
Can we play our house versus their house?

12:35.838 --> 12:37.590
<i>Then what house am I a part of?</i>

12:37.673 --> 12:40.259
You can be with us<i>,</i>
you and Vinnie can be with us.

12:41.969 --> 12:46.140
-Tell her we'll see her tomorrow.
-We'll see you-- She hung up.

12:46.223 --> 12:48.225
We'll be in the middle
of nowhere, vibing.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.939
-Drama on top of that.
-It's facts, bro.

12:54.690 --> 13:00.362
So what's, like, the difference between,
like, the house before, compared to this?

13:00.446 --> 13:02.573
That was when we were actually a unit.

13:03.157 --> 13:06.243
We didn't do anything without each other,
not one person.

13:06.327 --> 13:09.955
I feel kind of bad 'cause, like,
when you got put into my house,

13:10.039 --> 13:13.751
the way it happened,
I could tell there was tension and, like…

13:13.834 --> 13:16.629
Honestly, like I got in,
like, one argument with Mia.

13:18.214 --> 13:21.759
She would get mad about people coming over
and a lot of the vibe changed.

13:21.842 --> 13:24.929
I was an original members of Hype House
but I got in trouble.

13:25.012 --> 13:27.181
Everyone in that house had issues with Mia

13:27.264 --> 13:31.310
'cause they didn't like people over,
but people over is valuable to what we do.

13:31.393 --> 13:33.270
My dumb ass, one night, got drunk

13:33.354 --> 13:36.148
and I was like, "I'm gonna say
what everyone is scared to."

13:38.484 --> 13:40.986
It's just crazy how
I grew up with all these kids,

13:41.070 --> 13:43.364
then I get in one drunken argument…

13:43.447 --> 13:46.534
Thomas was like, "At this point,
you're moving in with Chase."

13:46.617 --> 13:49.912
That made me happy 'cause this is
where I wanted to be, but damn.

13:49.995 --> 13:53.541
That easy? One drunken argument
and I'm out like that?

13:55.292 --> 13:58.087
When I've been in it since the beginning?
That is crazy to me.

13:58.170 --> 14:03.300
I think so many people in one house,
the communication wasn't there for anyone.

14:03.384 --> 14:04.927
Yeah, but you can't lie about the fact

14:05.010 --> 14:08.097
that Mia always had a problem
with every single person.

14:08.180 --> 14:09.723
I had to apologize to Mia.

14:09.807 --> 14:13.894
She said, "I don't know if I want you
to live in this house with me."

14:13.978 --> 14:15.521
So that's your choice now?

14:16.272 --> 14:19.316
Because I got drunk and said
what everyone else was saying?

14:19.400 --> 14:21.068
At least I said it to you.

14:21.652 --> 14:23.904
-She's queen Hype House, fam.
-She is.

14:23.988 --> 14:26.115
-I respect that.
-Your ass is out of there.

14:26.198 --> 14:28.826
If that's what Mia wants,
Thomas got you out.

14:39.336 --> 14:40.754


14:40.838 --> 14:42.798


14:44.967 --> 14:46.468
Let's go, come on.

14:46.969 --> 14:47.803
Let's go.

14:50.347 --> 14:51.181
Off-roading!

14:56.020 --> 14:59.106
I'm first to the bus! Sheesh!

14:59.189 --> 15:00.024
-Guys!
-What?

15:00.107 --> 15:01.942
Make sure you pee right now.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.572
-Everyone ready?
-I'm ready!

15:07.698 --> 15:09.450
Why do we have to be squished?

15:09.533 --> 15:12.286
-It's only a four hour drive.
-Four hours, dude.

15:12.369 --> 15:14.330
Hey, yo, blast that a.c.!

15:14.955 --> 15:16.540
-<i>Hola!</i>
-Hi.

15:16.624 --> 15:18.250
-<i>Kamsahamnida.</i>
-Hi, Larray.

15:18.834 --> 15:19.835
Will this fit?

15:19.919 --> 15:21.670
-Hi, Lil Huddy.
-Where's Nikita?

15:23.380 --> 15:25.633
I thought
she was about to hit my car.

15:27.051 --> 15:29.678
-You're late.
-Ryland, can you help me?

15:29.762 --> 15:31.847
-With what?
-My suitcase was too big.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.641
We're going for one night!

15:33.724 --> 15:37.978
I had to pack my douche,
my vibrators, my strap-on.

15:38.062 --> 15:39.980
Oh my God.

15:40.064 --> 15:42.316
All right, guys,
I'm gonna be picking rooms soon.

15:42.399 --> 15:44.068
What? You're picking rooms?

15:44.151 --> 15:46.445
-I'm picking rooms.
-I don't get to choose?

15:46.528 --> 15:50.157
I think the place we're staying at
is very visually appealing

15:50.240 --> 15:53.285
and it's good for content,
and it's also in the middle of nowhere,

15:53.369 --> 15:55.537
and no one's there to bother us,
which is nice.

15:55.621 --> 15:58.749
For the love of God
can I please have a bathroom?

15:59.333 --> 16:03.337
I refuse to be on my period
and share a bathroom.

16:05.381 --> 16:08.092
-I'm about to pee my pants, bro.
-There's an exit.

16:08.175 --> 16:11.261
All right,
everyone utilize this pee break, okay?

16:11.345 --> 16:14.598
-Everyone's about to be lit.
-Lit.

16:16.767 --> 16:18.435
Honestly, let's spark a joint.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.896
This is a different vibe.
We're the crazy ones.

16:20.980 --> 16:24.191
We're a party bus,
they're the retirement bus.

16:34.410 --> 16:36.412
No, look-it. Look at all of them.

16:37.121 --> 16:38.789
Nikita,
who are you excited to see?

16:38.872 --> 16:41.625
-I think I'm excited to see everybody.
-Me too.

16:41.709 --> 16:44.003
It'll be really nice
to have everyone together.

16:44.086 --> 16:47.423
But I wonder if it's gonna get, like,
cliquey or something, you know?

16:47.506 --> 16:49.508
It's always been cliquey, low-key.

16:49.591 --> 16:51.260
That's true, I'll give you that.

16:51.343 --> 16:53.512
I just hope
no one gets irritated.

16:53.595 --> 16:56.765
I haven't seen everyone together
in a very long time,

16:56.849 --> 16:58.892
it's like,
there's this side and this side,

16:58.976 --> 17:02.521
there's the party side,
and there's the more, you know, um…

17:03.439 --> 17:07.026
family-friendly side,
and I like to live in both worlds.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.278
So why can't I have
all the above and then some

17:09.361 --> 17:11.572
and you guys get along and just…

17:11.655 --> 17:14.074
You know? Come together as people.

17:14.158 --> 17:17.077
I want everyone just
to take a shot and be like, "Yes!"

17:17.161 --> 17:19.496
-Exactly.
-Everyone just needs to loosen up a bit.

17:19.580 --> 17:22.499
I don't care.
Listen, that's more '42 for me.

17:22.583 --> 17:26.837
But, I'm just, like--
I feel like there's so much-- Everyone's…

17:26.920 --> 17:28.797
-Yeah, business.
-Yeah.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.633
Like, we're on vacation.

17:37.806 --> 17:38.807
We made it!

17:38.891 --> 17:40.017
Bitch, I'm excited.

17:40.100 --> 17:43.437
Anyways, you guys,
look at all these Joshua trees.

17:43.520 --> 17:46.023
Oh my God, we're, like,
in a Jeep adventure at a zoo.

17:46.106 --> 17:50.360
-Joshua Tree! Yes!
-Joshua Tree, bitch!

17:59.203 --> 18:00.412
Yay!

18:01.288 --> 18:03.123
-Woo, dirt!
-Hype House!

18:03.207 --> 18:05.209
-Woo!
-We made it.

18:05.292 --> 18:07.169
Vinnie, wake up, we're here.

18:07.252 --> 18:09.129
-We're here.
-Oi, Calvin, go!

18:09.213 --> 18:11.298
-Go, you--
-Don't drop the beer.

18:11.381 --> 18:12.841
Let's go!

18:18.722 --> 18:20.599
Okay, low-key, this spot's kind of sick.

18:20.682 --> 18:22.559
It's cool, like a little neighborhood.

18:22.643 --> 18:24.978
-Yeah.
-Wait, that's so sick.

18:25.062 --> 18:26.480
Oh, hell yeah.

18:26.563 --> 18:28.524
-This is cool.
-This is a lot of space.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.317
-I can edit my vlog today.
-Yep.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.111
Oh, ho, ho!

18:32.194 --> 18:33.821
This is how I feel right now.

18:34.404 --> 18:36.323
See this? It's how I feel.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.452
-Look at this.
-Chase.

18:40.536 --> 18:43.080
I'm filming. This should be Chase's room.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.959
This bitch is lit!

18:47.042 --> 18:49.044
I can't believe
we went the whole ride sober.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.046
-I'm proud of you.
-We did really good.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.298
Which way do we go
and why are we in the desert?

18:53.382 --> 18:54.633
Where's the ocean?

18:56.552 --> 18:58.053
Oh, this is cute.

19:00.681 --> 19:03.350
-I love the Caucasians.
-Wait! Yes!

19:03.433 --> 19:04.893
I love the aesthetic.

19:04.977 --> 19:08.230
I sound like one of those weird
Instagram bitches, "I love the aesthetic."

19:08.313 --> 19:09.606
Ew!

19:09.690 --> 19:12.651
I feel like I'm just, like,
super down with the dirt.

19:13.443 --> 19:14.528
Yeah.

19:14.611 --> 19:16.321
This is a vibe and a half!

19:16.905 --> 19:18.157
This is hard.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.576
I miss Chase being around.

19:20.659 --> 19:22.536
I love that kid, I'm excited to hang out.

19:22.619 --> 19:24.121
Where's our VIP room?

19:24.204 --> 19:26.915
You three are in that one
all the way over there.

19:26.999 --> 19:30.252
Oh, this is--
Oh my God, wait! We have a ship!

19:30.335 --> 19:32.796
-You guys are so poor.
-You're all poor!

19:32.880 --> 19:34.965
-We're not poor!
-You're all losers!

19:35.048 --> 19:37.259
It's so cute!

19:37.342 --> 19:39.803
-How many beds are there in here?
-We'll cuddle.

19:39.887 --> 19:42.931
-I'll just sleep like this.
-We're like best friends.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.808
Chase, this one's a vampire theme.

19:46.226 --> 19:49.730
Yo, bro, this is actually lit!

19:49.813 --> 19:52.191
I actually like this, I'm taking this one.

19:52.274 --> 19:54.276
-Taking this one.
-Take it. I knew he would.

19:57.154 --> 19:58.655
It's like your music video.

19:58.739 --> 20:01.200
Who decorated this?
I wanna kiss them.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.164
What is this?

20:07.247 --> 20:09.791
I was looking for
the tall Four Seasons building

20:09.875 --> 20:11.293
and I didn't see anything.

20:11.376 --> 20:12.419
Hi!

20:12.502 --> 20:14.004
Huddy! Come to the crib.

20:20.844 --> 20:23.597
Yeah, I don't even
want to look at other people's--

20:27.643 --> 20:29.603
-Hey!
-Thanks, Michael.

20:29.686 --> 20:33.190
Are you carrying Nikita's bags?
What a lovely gentleman you are.

20:42.115 --> 20:43.575
I'm gonna break a nail.

20:46.453 --> 20:48.538
Oh my God, Paper.

20:49.998 --> 20:51.416
Oh my God!

20:51.500 --> 20:53.001
What the hell?

20:53.085 --> 20:55.587
You already insult me,
now you're gonna get me wet?

21:04.638 --> 21:07.057
-They put me in "The Pony."
-Is it sickening?

21:07.140 --> 21:10.394
It's very small,
and my head hits the roof when I stand.

21:10.477 --> 21:11.645
-Really?
-Yeah.

21:11.728 --> 21:13.981
-Alright, let's go start drinking.
-Yeah.

21:14.064 --> 21:17.359
I could eat a drum,
not with ketchup though, bitch!

21:25.492 --> 21:26.618
Is someone dying?

21:26.702 --> 21:28.120
No, that just the hyena.

21:30.247 --> 21:33.000
Who do you think's
gonna get the most drunk tonight?

21:33.083 --> 21:33.917
Ryland.

21:34.668 --> 21:35.961
Or Paper.

21:36.545 --> 21:40.257
I went and said hi to everyone
and Paper goes, "Mia, you're so fake."

21:44.845 --> 21:46.638
And he goes…

21:46.722 --> 21:49.099
Then he goes, "Fist bump."
And I go, "No, I'm okay."

21:49.182 --> 21:51.852
Even though no one wants to admit it,
there's cliques.

21:51.935 --> 21:55.355
It's just, like, our house, like,
we hang out with each other all the time

21:55.439 --> 21:58.442
and Chase's house hangs out
with themselves all the time.

21:58.525 --> 22:00.986
It's unfortunate
but one trip's not gonna solve

22:01.069 --> 22:03.030
the fact that everybody's separated.

22:03.113 --> 22:04.281
Where's Chase?

22:07.284 --> 22:09.911
I look around,
no one's filming content.

22:10.871 --> 22:15.042
The whole point was to try to bring
everyone together, but sadly it's just…

22:15.125 --> 22:17.127
It's not as successful
as I would've liked.

22:24.593 --> 22:25.969
We got steak and chicken.

22:26.053 --> 22:28.347
Three beef tacos.

22:28.430 --> 22:31.058
-I'll do the Lumberjack Special.
-Thank you!

22:31.641 --> 22:33.435
-Who's sitting here?
-That's me!

22:33.518 --> 22:35.687
-Hmm.
-It's so good.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.569
Hey. Hey, Huddy.

22:43.403 --> 22:44.237
Hi, guys!

22:48.700 --> 22:50.035
I'm over it.

22:52.913 --> 22:54.915
This is like a high school clique.

22:54.998 --> 22:57.501
There's a group over here,
a group over here.

22:57.584 --> 22:59.920
It's a TikTok high school clique.

23:00.003 --> 23:01.546
It doesn't make any sense.

23:01.630 --> 23:06.468
We're all part of the same "organization,"
group-house thing, whatever.

23:06.551 --> 23:08.261
Why don't we come together and talk?

23:10.764 --> 23:12.307
What are they going off about?

23:12.391 --> 23:16.144
I don't know. I'm gonna look pretty,
get comfortable, and watch <i>Ratatouille</i>.

23:16.853 --> 23:18.397
Bro, where did they go?

23:18.480 --> 23:21.400
They ran to the trailer and hid.
That's where they are.

23:24.277 --> 23:27.280
I'm getting over
people not hanging out and not posting.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.661
No one's helping make content
or even hanging out.

23:39.084 --> 23:40.210
No one's talking about that.

23:48.218 --> 23:50.011
Why are you speaking for everyone else?

23:55.976 --> 23:59.020
Mia, I don't know if she's hyped up
because she's Thomas' girlfriend,

23:59.104 --> 24:04.151
or is she hyped up because she's a Leo,
or because of the desert fever,

24:06.027 --> 24:06.862
It's upsetting.

24:06.945 --> 24:09.906
It's the same conversation we've had
with everyone.

24:12.701 --> 24:17.289
It's frustrating because my heart and soul
goes into the Hype House and the business.

24:17.372 --> 24:20.125
I do YouTube, I do TikTok,
every other platform every day.

24:20.208 --> 24:22.169
I want you guys to give it your all

24:29.759 --> 24:33.722
I'm the only person that has done anything
on the business end of this.

24:33.805 --> 24:35.682
So that's why I get so stressed about it.

24:35.765 --> 24:38.351
I literally lost ten brain cells
from this conversation.

24:39.311 --> 24:40.979
-No--
-Wow, that's rude.

24:59.414 --> 25:04.044
And I love my boyfriend so much,
and it's like he's too nice.

25:07.923 --> 25:11.426
That's why I get so frustrated,
is I just want everyone to care.

25:11.510 --> 25:16.223
That's all. I just want everyone to care
and hold their end like they should.

25:16.306 --> 25:20.227
Some people have said that Mia meddles
in Thomas' affairs, I don't think so.

25:20.310 --> 25:23.313
I think she speaks
when Thomas doesn't want to, in a way.
