01:12.573 --> 01:14.573
Cat, wait.

01:14.574 --> 01:15.708
Come on!

01:18.846 --> 01:21.779
Move, move, come on!

01:30.390 --> 01:33.891
Cat, look. Cat, wait, there it is!

01:34.260 --> 01:37.027
Catherine, look!

01:45.572 --> 01:47.938
Francois, stop!

05:32.565 --> 05:34.932
Is this it?

05:37.937 --> 05:40.304
Um...

05:45.511 --> 05:48.581
- Okay.
- I guess.

05:48.582 --> 05:50.883
Well, I can see why this
isn't a tourist destination.

05:50.884 --> 05:54.251
- You wanna go back?
- And get inside the truck? No, you?

06:03.029 --> 06:06.064
The village is down
that road a stretch.

06:06.065 --> 06:07.927
The village is down this road?

06:08.553 --> 06:09.627
Do you mind driving us...

06:09.629 --> 06:14.374
- another 15 minutes to the village?
- No, no, no. No, no. I can't do that.

06:17.076 --> 06:21.333
Let's just pay him and keep going,
babe, okay? It can't be that far.

06:21.359 --> 06:24.381
- We can just walk.
- Sure.

06:25.718 --> 06:27.885
Thank you.

06:29.754 --> 06:30.989
Okay.

06:30.990 --> 06:34.892
Man, this is ridiculous. Awesome.

06:48.775 --> 06:50.941
What is that thing?

07:08.728 --> 07:11.497
This village is only
like 300 years old.

07:11.498 --> 07:14.000
But it's said to have housed some of

07:14.001 --> 07:17.367
the oldest Celtic
artifacts known to man.

07:20.006 --> 07:22.372
Whoa.

07:29.015 --> 07:31.448
Now that's creepy.

07:32.819 --> 07:34.985
Oh, boy.

07:41.995 --> 07:44.963
You got a pretty mouth, girl!

08:41.254 --> 08:43.089
There must be some mistake.

08:43.090 --> 08:46.626
Only mistake was trusting you
with our last weekend in Ireland.

09:01.007 --> 09:03.709
Nothing like that old
Irish charm, huh?

09:03.710 --> 09:06.443
Maybe this place won't
be a bust after all.

09:08.247 --> 09:11.117
Get you kids somethin'?

09:11.118 --> 09:14.553
Oh, um... Four pints would be great.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.354
Sounds good. Follow me.

09:21.027 --> 09:23.729
- Sit yourself down.
- Thank you.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.596
Thanks.

09:27.333 --> 09:30.203
Look at this place.

09:31.004 --> 09:35.005
You could do your masters of history
thesis just on this place, Soph.

09:35.141 --> 09:37.209
What do you know about history?

09:37.210 --> 09:39.178
I know everything about history.

09:39.179 --> 09:42.915
I know it's exactly what I'm
gonna make of these pints

09:42.916 --> 09:45.584
our lovely barmaid has brought us!

09:45.785 --> 09:46.652
Thank you.

09:46.653 --> 09:48.721
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

09:48.722 --> 09:50.655
To Ireland.

09:54.193 --> 10:00.664
Actually, I'm not sure I'm gonna
enroll in Berkeley for my master's.

10:01.734 --> 10:03.070
What?

10:03.071 --> 10:05.871
Yeah. I mean, with Ben going
to Harvard and everything,

10:05.872 --> 10:09.341
I thought I might just check out
the east coast for a while.

10:09.342 --> 10:10.909
Really?

10:13.245 --> 10:16.282
But you've wanted to get your master's
in history since you were like two, Soph.

10:16.283 --> 10:20.103
It's not like Berkeley's going
anywhere, and neither is history.

10:24.390 --> 10:27.159
So, uh, is this
quaint little village

10:27.160 --> 10:30.029
everything our potential
historian hoped it would be?

10:30.030 --> 10:33.399
I'm not sure yet, okay? We
haven't even seen anything.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.101
Okay.

10:35.102 --> 10:38.804
Excuse me, but I couldn't help
but overhear your conversation,

10:38.805 --> 10:40.506
and I hope you don't
think me too nosy,

10:40.507 --> 10:42.775
but you seem to be
a bit of a history buff.

10:42.776 --> 10:45.910
Come to see the village's ancient
historical sites, have you?

10:45.911 --> 10:48.414
- Hamish McConville.
- I'm Sophie.

10:48.415 --> 10:52.218
Now, if it's real
history you want to see

10:52.219 --> 10:54.754
you need to see the
<i>Clocha de na Deithe.</i>

10:54.755 --> 10:56.122
Clock de le what?

10:56.123 --> 10:58.723
The <i> Clocha de na Deithe?</i>

10:58.724 --> 11:03.428
Stones of the... Fathers?

11:03.429 --> 11:05.197
That's good, very close.

11:05.198 --> 11:08.365
The Stones of the Gods.

11:08.401 --> 11:11.771
- Sounds terrifying. I'm in!
- Man, me, too!

11:11.772 --> 11:13.673
What exactly are The
Stones of the Gods?

11:13.674 --> 11:17.877
Well, let me tell you.

11:17.878 --> 11:21.847
The <i>Clocha de na Deithe</i> is a
collection of enormous stone sculptures

11:21.848 --> 11:24.450
found in the middle of
a cave in the woods.

11:24.451 --> 11:27.319
Now, these sculptures
are thought to be

11:27.320 --> 11:30.122
the oldest existing
historical artifacts

11:30.123 --> 11:32.756
in all of Ireland.

11:34.894 --> 11:39.730
Quite possibly the cradle
of Celtic civilization itself.

11:41.133 --> 11:43.335
You're kidding.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.204
Why have we never
heard of them before?

11:45.205 --> 11:47.807
Oh, no, you won't
find mention of the

11:47.808 --> 11:51.243
<i>Clocha de na Deithe</i>
in any guidebooks.

11:51.244 --> 11:54.814
No, there's lots of things about our
village that people don't know about.

11:54.815 --> 12:00.453
A lot of things that we like to keep
private from the tourist trade.

12:00.454 --> 12:02.988
But you being a history
buff yourself,

12:02.989 --> 12:06.058
you're not your usual
tourist, are you?

12:07.494 --> 12:10.396
Well, thank you.
How do we get there?

12:10.397 --> 12:13.965
Now there... It's about a
seven hour hike from here.

12:13.966 --> 12:16.702
- Seven hours?
- Ouch.

12:16.703 --> 12:20.005
Well, you could always stay in
one of the cabins down the road.

12:20.006 --> 12:23.776
Leave first thing in the morning,
you'd be back by tomorrow night.

12:23.777 --> 12:27.277
That is, if you'd like, of course.

12:27.413 --> 12:30.116
A cabin in the woods?
What's not to like?

12:30.117 --> 12:31.484
I like your attitude.

12:31.485 --> 12:33.352
Well, what's not to
like is that this was

12:33.353 --> 12:36.188
supposed to be a day trip, guys.

12:37.189 --> 12:40.724
Okay. So it's an
overnight. Who cares?

12:43.763 --> 12:47.464
Well, let's put it to a
vote, then! All in favor?

12:51.337 --> 12:54.271
All opposed?

12:58.844 --> 13:00.811
What's it gonna be, Soph?

13:07.153 --> 13:09.488
Let's do it!

13:09.489 --> 13:11.924
Let's do it. Yes. It's gonna be fun.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.424
It's gonna be fun.

13:13.425 --> 13:15.792
Too bad, buddy.

13:17.096 --> 13:19.298
- Are you kidding me?
- I know, okay?

13:19.299 --> 13:22.334
But I just... I think this
could be a really cool thing.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.537
Like once in a lifetime.

13:24.538 --> 13:29.873
And you know how many medical
conferences I've sat through for you.

13:32.077 --> 13:34.213
All right.

13:34.214 --> 13:38.150
Good. Tell you what, I'll call my
son, and he'll come and pick us up.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.750
Now drink up, all of you. All right?

13:42.087 --> 13:45.087
Hey, thanks, man. Thank you. Cheers.

13:53.332 --> 13:54.500
There it is, guys.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.235
Hey, there you are, Sean.

13:56.236 --> 13:57.837
Look at that.

13:57.838 --> 14:01.440
This is Ben, Sophie,
David, and Jennifer.

14:01.441 --> 14:04.641
Now look at that, it's not pretty,
but it does the job, so...

14:06.545 --> 14:08.712
Let's go.

14:09.949 --> 14:11.915
Oh, boy.

14:14.086 --> 14:16.453
Hey.

14:53.926 --> 14:56.595
I thought you said there were
only gonna be a couple of 'em.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.929
Four is fine, son.

15:00.099 --> 15:02.066
Turn that radio up.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.602
Don't, Da!

15:03.603 --> 15:07.204
- Oh, come on. Lighten up, would you?
- I'm driving here.

15:08.040 --> 15:10.541
The poor boy gets
cranky in the summer.

15:10.542 --> 15:12.912
Who doesn't like the summer?

15:12.913 --> 15:15.214
What's to love about it, nancy boy?

15:15.215 --> 15:18.848
- Did he just call me a nancy boy?
- Yup.

15:19.418 --> 15:22.786
Ah, throw us another one, would you?

15:23.188 --> 15:25.123
That's the spirit.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.695
So we saw these stones on
the outside of the village,

15:29.696 --> 15:32.298
and I don't know too much
about Celtic symbols...

15:32.299 --> 15:34.299
All right, bullshit.

15:34.300 --> 15:36.135
What?

15:36.136 --> 15:39.505
But do you know by chance what
the symbols on the stones mean?

15:39.506 --> 15:41.573
I've got no idea, darlin'.

15:41.574 --> 15:43.575
Them stones have been
there for centuries,

15:43.576 --> 15:45.678
long before our village was built.

15:45.679 --> 15:48.380
But I tell you, about 15
years ago we discovered gold

15:48.381 --> 15:50.182
in an old Celtic cave.

15:50.183 --> 15:54.651
Turned it into a mine.
Stones were there, too.

15:55.587 --> 16:00.924
But eventually the cave collapsed.

16:02.161 --> 16:05.929
Well, things ain't been the
same round here ever since.

16:12.471 --> 16:15.372
Times, they can't be that tough.

16:15.641 --> 16:20.045
Ah, this? A guest gave that to me.

16:20.046 --> 16:24.547
Oh. It's a Rolex.

16:24.550 --> 16:26.485
It's a pretty nice gift.

16:26.486 --> 16:31.855
Well, I guess he appreciated
my hospitality.

16:40.666 --> 16:43.833
Da, you're making my ears bleed.

16:48.707 --> 16:52.742
It's not that bad. It's pretty nice.

16:53.178 --> 16:55.581
It's kind of run down
though, but whatever!

16:55.582 --> 16:57.649
That's not where you're staying.

16:57.650 --> 17:00.717
That's where we lived
before the mine closed.

17:13.432 --> 17:16.398
Well, there it is.

17:17.102 --> 17:19.868
The trail is right down there.

17:27.445 --> 17:29.481
You sure it's safe?
It's falling down a little.

17:29.482 --> 17:33.583
Ah, no. She's solid. On the inside.

17:36.655 --> 17:40.423
Just needs a lick of paint,
that's all. Good as new.

17:47.199 --> 17:51.303
We have to guard against break-ins
when the place isn't being used.

17:51.304 --> 17:54.506
You let a lot of people stay here?

17:54.507 --> 17:56.308
You said The Stones of the Gods

17:56.309 --> 17:58.975
was the village's best kept secret.

18:00.412 --> 18:04.415
Yeah. Well, that's why the
cabin don't get much use.

18:11.856 --> 18:13.556
Do you hear that?

18:21.400 --> 18:22.634
- Look! There.
- What is that?

18:22.635 --> 18:25.001
Get behind me.

18:26.505 --> 18:29.606
I said get behind me!

18:47.392 --> 18:49.294
Think you got it?

18:49.295 --> 18:51.130
Nah, it was too fast.

18:51.131 --> 18:52.297
Sorry about all that.

18:52.298 --> 18:53.398
What was that?

18:53.399 --> 18:55.200
What was that all about?

18:55.201 --> 18:58.504
Well, there's a lot of wild
boars round these parts.

18:58.505 --> 19:01.807
They can get pretty nasty. Anyway...

19:01.808 --> 19:05.810
Sorry to give you such a scare.
Let's get you settled.

19:05.811 --> 19:08.178
Come on.

19:13.318 --> 19:15.518
You okay?

19:19.291 --> 19:21.825
Right, here we are then.

19:24.163 --> 19:28.031
Now there's no power,
but no problem.

19:29.234 --> 19:32.168
The miracle of modern
technology, eh?

19:53.425 --> 19:56.226
Can I give you some
money for those beers?

19:56.828 --> 19:58.897
Oh, no, thanks. I'm good.

19:58.898 --> 20:02.131
Oh, good. Because I
didn't bring my Rolex.

20:03.934 --> 20:05.938
You're a funny boy.

20:05.939 --> 20:09.506
But there's lots of other
things I could steal from you.

20:17.582 --> 20:19.148
Gotcha.

20:20.519 --> 20:22.719
Let's go, son.

20:29.695 --> 20:33.530
Well, I'm sure the rooms are fine.

20:35.467 --> 20:37.602
- Let's check out the rooms.
- Okay.

20:37.603 --> 20:40.036
Oh, we got a queen size!

21:07.466 --> 21:10.468
Thanks, again, for
agreeing to do this.

21:10.469 --> 21:12.635
Mmm-hmm.

21:13.705 --> 21:15.872
It means a lot to me.

21:17.442 --> 21:24.981
And have you thought at all
about me coming out your way?

21:26.551 --> 21:31.187
Uh, I think it sounds interesting.

21:32.391 --> 21:34.357
Okay.

21:36.695 --> 21:39.062
Well, I mean...

21:39.431 --> 21:43.900
Do you really think you
could give all this up?

21:47.773 --> 21:50.340
I know I'd miss you.

21:57.883 --> 22:00.283
I'd miss you, too.

22:04.456 --> 22:06.623
Good night.

22:06.725 --> 22:09.092
Good night, babe.

22:27.713 --> 22:31.381
David? David!

22:48.467 --> 22:49.935
Seriously?

22:49.936 --> 22:53.369
What? What's up, baby?

22:53.572 --> 22:55.738
You good?

23:12.724 --> 23:15.126
Did you hear that?

25:08.638 --> 25:12.176
David, David, wake up!
David, wake up! You guys.

25:12.177 --> 25:14.546
Holy fuck.

25:14.547 --> 25:16.648
Whoa, whoa, what's going on?

25:16.649 --> 25:19.818
- There's something out there.
- What do you mean?

25:20.319 --> 25:22.451
The window?

25:27.092 --> 25:28.760
That's why they call
it the woods, babe.

25:28.761 --> 25:32.128
Lions and tigers and
chickens and shit.

25:35.767 --> 25:38.703
Hey. Jesus, what's up?

25:38.704 --> 25:40.739
She said she saw
something in the woods.

25:44.042 --> 25:45.911
Okay.

25:54.052 --> 25:56.419
You okay?

25:56.922 --> 25:58.857
I don't see anything.

25:58.858 --> 26:00.859
It's probably just a wild boar...

26:00.860 --> 26:02.827
No, no. It was not a boar, you guys.

26:02.828 --> 26:05.130
Maybe just your
overactive imagination?

26:05.131 --> 26:07.132
It was not my fucking
imagination, David!

26:07.133 --> 26:09.134
We cannot stay here.

26:09.135 --> 26:12.501
Okay, okay. Hey. Listen,
I'll check. I'll check.

26:18.877 --> 26:21.444
You're gonna go outside right now?

26:30.589 --> 26:31.723
It's locked.

26:31.724 --> 26:33.925
- What?
- What?

26:33.926 --> 26:36.158
It's locked from the outside.

26:36.761 --> 26:39.528
- What do you mean?
- Do you have a key?

26:40.098 --> 26:42.665
What is going on?

26:52.210 --> 26:54.944
That doesn't make any sense.

26:58.283 --> 27:00.884
They locked us in here?

27:00.885 --> 27:02.287
They locked us in here?

27:02.288 --> 27:04.122
No, they didn't lock us in here.

27:04.123 --> 27:05.990
That's the only door, right?

27:05.991 --> 27:08.524
What? No.

27:11.062 --> 27:13.996
What is going on, you guys?

27:20.138 --> 27:22.140
- You sure he didn't give you a key?
- No.

27:22.141 --> 27:25.074
That doesn't make any sense.

27:31.416 --> 27:34.150
All the windows are barred, yeah?

27:42.361 --> 27:45.594
- Ow, fuck!
- Whoa, what was that?

27:45.997 --> 27:48.164
What happened?

27:52.370 --> 27:54.537
What? What the...

28:03.982 --> 28:06.884
What the fuck was that?
Jesus Christ!

28:07.285 --> 28:10.355
Please stop, please stop!

28:11.956 --> 28:14.056
Please stop.

28:16.695 --> 28:18.063
It'll be okay. It'll be okay.

28:22.201 --> 28:23.902
Oh, my God. Oh, my God,
it got your ear.

28:23.903 --> 28:25.937
What? Oh, God.

28:25.938 --> 28:29.173
It's okay, we're safe.
We're safe now.

28:29.174 --> 28:31.540
You think it's gone?

28:37.115 --> 28:40.449
- What was that?
- I don't know.

29:07.479 --> 29:08.913
Jesus Christ...

29:08.914 --> 29:10.381
I saw...

29:10.382 --> 29:13.115
Okay, wait. Shh! Quiet.

29:16.222 --> 29:18.790
Let me out, let me out, let me out!

29:18.791 --> 29:22.324
Let me out, fuck! Please let me out.

29:53.424 --> 29:55.791
Shit, let's go!

29:59.564 --> 30:02.731
How the hell are we
getting out of here?

30:03.935 --> 30:06.070
Same way it got in!

30:06.071 --> 30:08.370
Climb out!

30:09.941 --> 30:12.775
Come on, let's go!

30:28.993 --> 30:30.528
My leg!

30:30.529 --> 30:31.596
Close the fucking door!

30:31.597 --> 30:34.296
Okay, okay, I got it.

30:42.506 --> 30:44.840
Fuck!

30:45.910 --> 30:48.277
Fucking close the door!

30:49.347 --> 30:52.581
Okay, go, go, go, go, go!

30:57.055 --> 30:58.957
Fuck!

30:58.958 --> 31:01.824
Come on, man. Fuck!

31:04.295 --> 31:07.432
They locked us in there so
that thing would kill us.

31:07.433 --> 31:09.200
They're assuming we're dead.

31:09.201 --> 31:12.535
What about the house? Maybe
there's a phone or something.

31:14.072 --> 31:16.238
Come on!

31:23.948 --> 31:25.915
Hey!

32:11.696 --> 32:13.862
Fuck!

32:14.132 --> 32:16.298
Guess what.

32:24.309 --> 32:25.410
Hey, over here!

32:25.411 --> 32:27.576
Come on, over here!

32:42.327 --> 32:45.928
What is that... What
is that thing, man?

32:47.432 --> 32:49.798
It can't get in.

33:05.249 --> 33:07.616
What is that?

33:10.154 --> 33:12.023
Were you gonna just
fucking leave me out there?

33:12.049 --> 33:15.658
- Take it easy.
- Where were you?

33:20.331 --> 33:22.498
You okay?

33:30.675 --> 33:33.042
Okay.

33:34.112 --> 33:36.078
Okay, guys.

33:36.147 --> 33:38.314
Come on we gotta find a phone.

34:20.123 --> 34:22.958
Sophie.

35:23.488 --> 35:24.856
Hey.

35:24.857 --> 35:26.857
Sit down.

35:26.858 --> 35:30.959
Come on, sit down.

35:46.177 --> 35:49.011
It's gotta be done, son.

35:49.313 --> 35:51.480
This doesn't feel right, Da.

35:51.716 --> 35:54.116
It's never easy.

35:58.856 --> 36:00.858
Ah, thanks, Ian.

36:00.859 --> 36:03.025
No problem.

36:05.630 --> 36:09.700
Not sure my son has the
stomach for this, after all.

36:09.701 --> 36:13.638
Wouldn't it be easier just
to leave this village?

36:13.639 --> 36:18.876
You don't abandon your home just
because the times get tough.

36:18.877 --> 36:22.313
'Round these parts you
fight for what's yours.

36:22.314 --> 36:24.482
By letting innocent people die?

36:24.483 --> 36:29.387
No, Sean, not innocent. Outsiders.

36:29.388 --> 36:32.924
Now they came here of
their own free will.

36:32.925 --> 36:37.192
We're just giving 'em a little push
in the right direction, that's all.

36:38.396 --> 36:42.130
Hey, Dave, this is gonna hurt, man.

37:00.484 --> 37:02.918
God...

37:12.330 --> 37:15.097
Should've been enough time, huh?

37:15.433 --> 37:18.267
Seem to have misplaced my watch.

37:31.716 --> 37:34.885
There didn't have
to be four of them.

37:34.886 --> 37:39.257
You knew there would come a time when
you'd have to give us a helpin' hand

37:39.258 --> 37:40.891
rather than stayin'
back where it's safe

37:40.892 --> 37:43.859
and letting other people
do the dirty work.

37:44.328 --> 37:46.295
Yeah, well...

37:46.664 --> 37:49.267
Maybe if you all hadn't
have been so greedy,

37:49.268 --> 37:51.969
and taken all that
gold from its cave...

37:51.970 --> 37:54.839
Well, maybe if we
increase our offerin',

37:54.840 --> 37:59.276
we can buy us some
lenience the next time!

37:59.277 --> 38:01.243
Next time...

38:22.667 --> 38:25.870
This is it.

38:25.871 --> 38:30.138
Oh, my God, this is the symbol that
was on the stone outside of town.

38:30.675 --> 38:32.841
That's it.

38:38.849 --> 38:41.484
It can't be right.

38:41.485 --> 38:43.454
What?

38:43.455 --> 38:45.655
It means...

38:45.656 --> 38:48.757
<i>Tuatha De Danann.</i>

38:49.360 --> 38:51.927
What the fuck does that mean?

38:52.396 --> 38:54.763
Leprechaun.

38:56.734 --> 39:00.338
Come on! Leprechaun?

39:00.339 --> 39:03.338
I'm just telling you what it says.

39:06.777 --> 39:11.246
Whatever it is, you think that's
what they dug up in that mine?

39:11.716 --> 39:15.453
It wasn't a mine
originally, it was a cave.

39:15.454 --> 39:18.689
But the people in the village took the
gold, that's what Hamish said to us.

39:18.690 --> 39:21.125
Okay, now we're
talking pots of gold?

39:21.126 --> 39:23.394
I know.

39:23.395 --> 39:26.695
I know it sounds crazy, but...

39:32.670 --> 39:36.005
This is what happens
when you take its gold.

39:36.006 --> 39:39.410
You have to make amends.

39:39.411 --> 39:42.010
Until the debt has been repaid.

39:43.581 --> 39:46.751
So they put us in this cabin
they locked us in there

39:46.752 --> 39:51.219
to sacrifice us to a leprechaun?

39:52.890 --> 39:56.727
You guys, my earring was gold.

39:56.728 --> 40:01.432
Okay, guys, leprechaun,
<i>Tuatha de,</i> whatever the hell,

40:01.433 --> 40:05.901
killing machine, whatever the fuck
it is. How do we get out of here?

40:06.871 --> 40:09.707
Look, these stones
are like a boundary,

40:09.708 --> 40:11.942
like an ancient warning
sign or something.

40:11.943 --> 40:15.645
Maybe the leprechaun won't go past
a certain distance from its cave...

40:15.646 --> 40:17.581
So?

40:17.582 --> 40:20.451
So, if we make it to the stones...

40:20.452 --> 40:23.487
Then what, the leprechaun won't
go past the stones, Sophie?

40:23.488 --> 40:25.623
Really?

40:25.624 --> 40:30.025
No, that makes sense. That's why the guy
who dropped us off didn't go past them.

40:32.830 --> 40:35.797
We have to get back there.

41:14.839 --> 41:16.674
Jesus Christ.

41:16.675 --> 41:18.542
Where the hell are they?

41:18.543 --> 41:20.778
They got out?

41:20.779 --> 41:26.448
If they're still alive,
that means it hasn't fed!

41:26.684 --> 41:29.251
Let's go!

41:33.858 --> 41:36.525
In the trucks, now!

41:52.776 --> 41:55.377
Lord, have mercy.

41:56.213 --> 41:58.215
They're back.

41:58.216 --> 42:01.449
What are we going to do, guys?

42:07.124 --> 42:09.727
Everybody grab something!

42:09.728 --> 42:12.662
Check downstairs,
down the basement!

42:12.663 --> 42:14.830
Check the attic!

43:07.685 --> 43:11.119
Lord, have mercy...

43:48.092 --> 43:50.926
Just drop the gun, man.

44:01.939 --> 44:03.974
Atta boy, Sean.

44:03.975 --> 44:06.641
Well done.

44:10.080 --> 44:11.649
Drop it, guys.

44:11.650 --> 44:13.884
I don't think so, boy-o.

44:13.885 --> 44:19.154
How the hell did all of you
get out of that cabin?

44:20.424 --> 44:23.727
Maybe they've earned
their freedom, Da.

44:23.728 --> 44:26.130
And have that thing, come
back to our village?

44:26.131 --> 44:29.197
Start preyin' on us again?

44:33.070 --> 44:35.637
Or you?

44:39.176 --> 44:40.978
Just let us go...

44:40.979 --> 44:43.478
You be quiet, missy.

44:51.923 --> 44:53.791
It's Ian. It's Ian!

44:53.792 --> 44:55.159
Out with me now, come on!

44:55.160 --> 44:57.559
I'll deal with you later!

44:59.698 --> 45:03.164
You bolt that door. Make
sure they don't come out!

45:55.819 --> 45:57.788
How we getting out of here?

46:01.892 --> 46:04.292
That'll work.

46:25.883 --> 46:27.849
Come on.

47:25.075 --> 47:26.376
Shit!

47:26.377 --> 47:29.911
Fuck, ah, fuck!

47:30.514 --> 47:31.915
No keys! No keys!

47:31.916 --> 47:34.916
We gotta get to the stones, come on!

48:38.448 --> 48:40.815
Ian.

48:41.551 --> 48:43.053
Behind you.

49:21.058 --> 49:24.692
- You gotta get up, man.
- I can't. My leg.

49:25.429 --> 49:28.963
Oh, my God! My leg!

49:30.968 --> 49:33.537
I can't do this. I can't do this.

49:33.538 --> 49:35.903
Yes, you can.

49:36.373 --> 49:37.441
Oh, my God, you guys!

49:37.442 --> 49:40.341
Hey, hey!

49:41.244 --> 49:42.279
- Hey!
- Help!

49:42.280 --> 49:44.313
Hey!

49:44.314 --> 49:46.881
Stop, stop, stop!

49:50.687 --> 49:52.722
What're you kids doing out
here this time of night?

49:52.723 --> 49:54.658
We need your help!

49:54.659 --> 49:57.394
Hamish and his son, they...

49:57.395 --> 49:59.496
Did they try to hurt you?

49:59.497 --> 50:01.732
Please, we need your help.

50:01.733 --> 50:03.300
Hurry, get in the back.

50:03.301 --> 50:04.334
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

50:04.335 --> 50:06.701
Hey, come on.

50:28.625 --> 50:30.992
Come here, baby.

51:08.331 --> 51:11.366
Now just stay tight here.

51:20.477 --> 51:22.079
We gotta get out.

51:22.080 --> 51:24.080
Try your doors. Try your doors!

51:24.314 --> 51:27.415
Oh, my God, are we locked in?

51:28.218 --> 51:29.453
Good work, Mary.

51:29.454 --> 51:31.619
Thank you, Hamish.

51:34.658 --> 51:36.991
The doors aren't opening.

51:39.729 --> 51:41.298
Get out of the car, all of you!

51:41.299 --> 51:42.432
Out of the car.

51:42.433 --> 51:45.066
Now! All of you!

51:50.273 --> 51:53.107
Step away from the car.

51:57.614 --> 51:59.850
Please don't do this.

51:59.851 --> 52:04.321
If we don't keep this thing
satisfied, there'll be hell to pay.

52:04.322 --> 52:08.156
You're so pathetic.
This is your fault, not ours.

52:08.425 --> 52:10.293
I could shoot you.

52:10.294 --> 52:11.895
But we need all of you alive.

52:11.896 --> 52:13.630
You can't just leave
us out here alone!

52:13.631 --> 52:17.433
Oh, we're not leaving you... alone.

52:54.704 --> 52:59.173
Sophie, wake up!

53:18.261 --> 53:21.062
You okay?

53:50.327 --> 53:53.761
You guys. Did you hear that?

54:22.726 --> 54:26.093
- Sophie!
- Ben!

54:26.663 --> 54:29.130
Get away from me!

54:42.779 --> 54:46.248
Please! No, no, no, no, no!

54:57.027 --> 54:59.827
Get away!

55:11.608 --> 55:15.242
Get away from me! Get away from me!

55:17.013 --> 55:20.047
No!

55:30.627 --> 55:33.961
Get off me!

55:39.736 --> 55:43.804
David! Don't leave
us, don't leave us!

55:47.344 --> 55:50.244
Help!

56:17.073 --> 56:19.807
Come on!

56:21.144 --> 56:23.944
He's not going to make it.

56:24.848 --> 56:25.949
Sophie!

56:25.950 --> 56:27.417
Sophie!

56:27.418 --> 56:29.383
Come on!

56:39.462 --> 56:41.464
We've got to keep going
back to the cabin!

56:41.465 --> 56:44.365
What? Why?

56:44.567 --> 56:47.401
Because we're gonna kill it.

57:19.068 --> 57:21.435
All right.

57:23.506 --> 57:26.409
We just need to find a way to lock
it from the outside once it's inside.

57:26.410 --> 57:27.444
- It's inside?
- Yeah.

57:27.445 --> 57:28.711
One of us is gonna be outside,

57:28.712 --> 57:32.179
the other two will be
in here waiting. Okay?

57:35.084 --> 57:38.621
You don't have to be
in here with it, okay?

57:38.622 --> 57:41.157
You just need to be outside,
bolt the door once it's in here.

57:41.158 --> 57:42.992
We'll do everything else, okay?

57:42.993 --> 57:45.893
I know you can do this, okay?

57:45.962 --> 57:48.329
You can do this.

57:55.004 --> 57:57.838
You sure we can do this?

58:49.626 --> 58:51.592
Okay.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.735
He's coming!

59:43.279 --> 59:45.446
Oh, my God!

59:57.694 --> 59:59.660
Oh, God!

01:00:09.072 --> 01:00:10.974
Sophie. Sophie, no!

01:00:10.975 --> 01:00:13.641
We're not going back
to the farmhouse.

01:00:15.812 --> 01:00:18.479
There's the truck.

01:00:21.718 --> 01:00:23.186
Come on. Come on!

01:00:23.187 --> 01:00:25.552
Hurry!

01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:42.670
Come on!

01:00:48.277 --> 01:00:51.412
Where did he go?

01:00:56.219 --> 01:00:57.720
Shit!

01:00:57.721 --> 01:01:00.521
We have to get to the stones!

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:07.594
There's no keys. There's no keys.

01:01:16.005 --> 01:01:18.439
Where did it go?

01:01:32.455 --> 01:01:35.622
Why didn't you come back?

01:01:35.858 --> 01:01:37.060
What?

01:01:37.061 --> 01:01:41.197
When I fell. Why didn't
you come back for me?

01:01:41.198 --> 01:01:44.665
I came to the truck so we could
get the fuck out of here.

01:01:52.875 --> 01:01:54.844
The keys have to be on him.

01:01:54.845 --> 01:01:57.444
Oh, shit.

01:01:58.448 --> 01:02:01.115
We have to get the keys from him.

01:02:05.988 --> 01:02:08.589
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:02:08.891 --> 01:02:11.160
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:02:11.161 --> 01:02:13.062
You stay here. I'll go get the keys.

01:02:13.063 --> 01:02:14.297
No.

01:02:19.269 --> 01:02:20.470
Take this. We need a distraction.

01:02:20.471 --> 01:02:22.871
- I'll get the keys.
- No, no, no, no.

01:02:22.872 --> 01:02:24.841
I'll be fine on my own.

01:02:24.842 --> 01:02:26.476
Okay. Okay.

01:02:44.961 --> 01:02:46.195
We have to go!

01:02:46.196 --> 01:02:48.662
Go, go, go, go!

01:03:49.892 --> 01:03:52.259
Farmhouse!

01:04:07.977 --> 01:04:10.244
Oh!

01:04:26.864 --> 01:04:29.830
We've gotta go!
Go, get to the attic!

01:07:23.406 --> 01:07:25.906
Please.

01:08:47.723 --> 01:08:52.091
Put your hands up real slow-like.

01:08:59.835 --> 01:09:03.136
Jeez, Sean!

01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:09.578
Sean, you done real good, son.

01:09:09.578 --> 01:09:12.011
You done real good.

01:09:15.684 --> 01:09:18.185
Real good.

01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:29.930
I'm so sorry.

01:09:36.305 --> 01:09:37.573
Run.

01:09:37.573 --> 01:09:40.140
What?

01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:43.643
Run, get out of here!

01:09:46.814 --> 01:09:48.551
What the hell you doin', boy?

01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:49.818
You lettin' her escape!

01:09:49.819 --> 01:09:52.388
Put your gun down now.

01:09:52.389 --> 01:09:54.688
What?

01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:59.092
I said, put it down!

01:09:59.228 --> 01:10:01.931
You've always been a fool.

01:10:01.932 --> 01:10:06.500
How are you gonna shoot a girl, Da?

01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:10.639
Is that what you've
become, a murderer?

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:15.008
Hey, you wanna shoot me?
Go ahead, shoot me!

01:10:16.712 --> 01:10:19.112
The shit you make me do.

01:10:19.615 --> 01:10:22.549
You're a goddamned fool!

01:11:01.991 --> 01:11:04.190
Sean?

01:11:12.635 --> 01:11:15.201
The window!

01:11:15.404 --> 01:11:17.604
Ahhh!

01:12:44.893 --> 01:12:47.327
Get off!

01:12:55.938 --> 01:12:58.304
Get off!

01:13:04.146 --> 01:13:06.312
Get off!

01:13:12.654 --> 01:13:15.388
Get the fuck off me!

01:16:38.226 --> 01:16:41.361
Fuck you, Lucky Charms.
