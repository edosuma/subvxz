WEBVTT

00:28.458 --> 00:29.916
This is your guy?

00:29.958 --> 00:33.000
The hunter is our guy, my dear Kronis.

00:33.041 --> 00:35.458
Yeah, but can we trust him?

00:35.500 --> 00:37.291
He seems a little... off.

00:37.333 --> 00:39.708
This isn't my first coup, you know.

00:39.750 --> 00:43.375
We need numbers if we're going to overthrow Skeletor.

00:43.416 --> 00:45.666
Sure, but... look at him.

00:51.458 --> 00:52.833
What even is that?

00:52.875 --> 00:54.000
Ugh.

00:54.041 --> 00:55.583
He's a woodsman.

00:55.625 --> 00:58.541
He's doing what "woods-people" do.

01:04.791 --> 01:08.708
You're clearly an "outside the box" kind of guy,

01:08.750 --> 01:13.083
maybe even a little more beast than man.

01:13.125 --> 01:16.875
But what exactly is it you bring to the table...

01:16.916 --> 01:21.541
...aside from fashion that's right up my alley...

01:21.583 --> 01:22.791
and fleas?

01:22.833 --> 01:25.416
R'Qazz can control animals.

01:25.458 --> 01:27.291
Who's R'Qazz?

01:27.333 --> 01:30.250
R'Qazz is R'Qazz.

01:30.291 --> 01:33.166
Oh, I see. It's a whole thing, yeah.

01:33.208 --> 01:34.500
I can respect that.

01:34.541 --> 01:38.333
When R'Qazz controls these animals,

01:38.375 --> 01:40.750
do they become evil?

01:45.333 --> 01:48.583
If Skeletor wants them to be.

01:50.208 --> 01:53.000
Good answer.

01:53.041 --> 01:56.000
I like him.

01:57.791 --> 01:59.833
So what's the job?

01:59.875 --> 02:04.166
That Grayskull place that gave the Tiger Tribe kids magic?

02:04.208 --> 02:06.458
Grayskull is yesterday's news.

02:06.500 --> 02:09.083
We're going after the throne in Eternos,

02:09.125 --> 02:12.583
and we have all the power we need right here.

02:12.625 --> 02:14.791
Hand Skeletor your weapon,

02:14.833 --> 02:18.291
and I'll be more than happy to show you how.

02:19.250 --> 02:20.583
Good boy.

02:20.625 --> 02:22.625
You forgot mine, Lord Skeletor.

02:25.708 --> 02:30.083
Oh, I'm chewing on something else for you.

02:36.208 --> 02:39.125
Oh, dear brother...

02:39.166 --> 02:42.125
If only you could see what I'm doing right now...

02:47.375 --> 02:51.875
If only you could feel the power coursing through these tools.

02:58.625 --> 03:03.458
Soon, Randor, you will taste the ash and the fire

03:03.500 --> 03:07.166
and the blood and the pain that is the recipe

03:07.208 --> 03:10.500
for both my victory...

03:10.541 --> 03:14.208
and your defeat!

03:17.500 --> 03:20.125
I have the Power!

04:12.250 --> 04:14.041
-Whoa!

04:16.000 --> 04:20.291
This little practice session seems a little one-sided, don't you think?

04:20.333 --> 04:22.625
I guess I'm just used to sparring with Krass.

04:26.791 --> 04:30.250
Yeah, huh? When she's coming back, by the way?

04:30.291 --> 04:31.416
No clue.

04:33.208 --> 04:35.458
-Whoa!

04:41.958 --> 04:43.208
Whew.

04:43.250 --> 04:45.125
I'm sure I'll get the hang of it.

04:45.166 --> 04:48.333
Duncan, perhaps you should take a breather and check on Teela.

04:48.375 --> 04:51.625
Yep! Sure thing. You guys just...

04:51.666 --> 04:53.458
roar!

04:53.500 --> 04:55.583
...out your feelings or whatever.

04:59.875 --> 05:01.583
We only just now met Duncan.

05:01.625 --> 05:03.625
I'd hate for you to break him.

05:03.666 --> 05:07.583
I can't exactly head back to the village and spar with Krass, now, can I?

05:07.625 --> 05:08.875
She made her choice.

05:08.916 --> 05:10.791
And have you made yours?

05:13.791 --> 05:16.375
I wouldn't even know where to start with the king--

05:16.416 --> 05:18.416
with my dad.

05:18.458 --> 05:22.333
Eh, sometimes friendly waters can appear to be dangerous.

05:22.375 --> 05:23.583
Because of toothfish?

05:23.625 --> 05:24.916
No.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.791
It's a saying the Merfolk have.

05:26.833 --> 05:29.666
It means you can't possibly know what something is like

05:29.708 --> 05:31.416
unless you try it for yourself.

05:31.458 --> 05:34.625
"Hey, Dad, it's me, the lost prince,"

05:34.666 --> 05:37.750
feels like a pretty all-or-nothing thing to do, Cringe.

05:37.791 --> 05:41.666
One can observe a toothfish without becoming a toothfish.

05:41.708 --> 05:43.958
That isn't a saying. You're just making that up.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.416
You've never met the Merfolk.

05:45.458 --> 05:46.250
You don't know.

05:56.458 --> 05:58.916
-Come with me.

06:00.583 --> 06:03.583
The monarchy is not responsible for any loss or damage

06:03.625 --> 06:06.375
-during a climate change event. -Hurry!

06:06.416 --> 06:08.416
-The storm is coming, quick!

06:08.458 --> 06:10.958
-Get to safety!

06:11.000 --> 06:12.916
-Let's get out of here! -Huh?

06:15.458 --> 06:18.458
I'm supposed to live... there?

06:21.291 --> 06:23.500
--Watch it!

06:23.541 --> 06:25.375
I'm trying to get home before the storm hits.

06:25.416 --> 06:27.083
Sorry. I was just distracted.

06:27.125 --> 06:29.666
Give me those back! He didn't pay for those!

06:32.625 --> 06:34.416
I guess the guards are too busy

06:34.458 --> 06:37.333
helping get everyone to shelter to do their jobs!

06:37.375 --> 06:38.791
Excuse me.

06:38.833 --> 06:41.083
I need to... sneeze.

06:50.250 --> 06:53.208
And you're sure General Dolos hasn't checked in?

06:53.250 --> 06:55.416
Not a peep since the day he broke into the vault

06:55.458 --> 06:57.416
and nipped that rubic of Kirbinite.

06:57.458 --> 07:00.375
I don't know what to think about any of that.

07:06.833 --> 07:11.000
Are we prepared to face this mysterious storm front without him?

07:11.041 --> 07:13.750
Market's closing. Hatches, battened.

07:13.791 --> 07:16.125
Doors, bolted. Windows, closed.

07:16.166 --> 07:18.666
That's what I meant by "hatches, battened."

07:18.708 --> 07:22.791
Yeah, but the city's got its fair share of actual hatches, too, dunnit?

07:22.833 --> 07:25.333
We ain't leaving them open, are we?

07:25.375 --> 07:27.708
It's a simple yes or no.

07:29.583 --> 07:32.583
Has the storm breached the border already, Sire?

07:32.625 --> 07:34.875
That wasn't the storm.

07:42.208 --> 07:44.125
Stealing is wrong.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.750
You aren't with the Guard.

07:47.791 --> 07:49.333
What are you gonna do about it?

07:51.791 --> 07:54.291
Ow!

07:55.750 --> 07:57.500
Come back here!

08:05.041 --> 08:06.083
There you go.

08:11.791 --> 08:12.875
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

08:16.625 --> 08:17.875
Thanks!

08:17.916 --> 08:19.458
Aw, nuts.

08:33.875 --> 08:35.916
Ah, that doesn't make any sense.

08:35.958 --> 08:39.000
Keldor isn't hiding in Eternos.

08:39.041 --> 08:40.333
Hey, Teela.

08:42.708 --> 08:44.291
I really need to find a room with a door...

08:44.333 --> 08:45.791
and a door with a lock.

08:46.916 --> 08:48.541
Any luck finding the bad guys?

08:48.583 --> 08:50.041
--Does a tiger lay eggs?

08:50.083 --> 08:51.708
Whoa!

08:51.750 --> 08:53.458
I mean, I never knew that tigers could talk before, so--

08:53.500 --> 08:54.666
Tigers don't lay eggs.

08:56.750 --> 08:59.208
I know I'm doing the spell right, but there's too much weird interference

08:59.250 --> 09:01.333
for me to trace it back to the source.

09:01.375 --> 09:03.583
Which is... Keldor's staff?

09:04.541 --> 09:05.750
Exactly.

09:05.791 --> 09:08.250
Well, if this was science and not magic,

09:08.291 --> 09:12.000
I'd say you just need to boost your signal or find a stronger antenna.

09:14.166 --> 09:15.791
Of course!

09:15.833 --> 09:17.708
The supreme power chamber.

09:17.750 --> 09:19.416
It can channel Havoc.

09:21.083 --> 09:22.916
Uh, okay.

09:24.875 --> 09:27.250
If I can tap into the natural flow of Havoc itself,

09:27.291 --> 09:29.791
I should be able to feel my way back to the source.

09:31.791 --> 09:33.333
Exciting, very exciting,

09:33.375 --> 09:36.166
but isn't bringing Havoc into the castle--I don't know--

09:36.208 --> 09:38.000
a really bad idea?

09:38.041 --> 09:39.666
Only if something goes wrong.

09:45.583 --> 09:49.791
Your Highness, might we advise caution this close to the storm?

09:49.833 --> 09:53.541
There's only one thing that could have created that type of energy,

09:53.583 --> 09:57.541
and I'm willing to bet we will find our missing sword at its source.

09:57.583 --> 09:58.958
Get to shelter!

10:00.500 --> 10:01.791
You!

10:01.833 --> 10:03.333
What are you doing here?

10:03.375 --> 10:04.291
Stopping--

10:05.750 --> 10:08.375
Stopping this guy from stealing...

10:08.416 --> 10:10.125
Hey, what do you sell, anyway?

10:10.166 --> 10:11.666
Uh, bags.

10:11.708 --> 10:14.291
So that's a bag of... bags?

10:14.333 --> 10:16.625
Well, it certainly ain't a box, innit?

10:16.666 --> 10:20.208
Arrest that man and take the Sword of Power into custody.

10:34.083 --> 10:37.250
Did you bring this accursed weather upon my city?

10:38.000 --> 10:39.208
Wha--

10:46.250 --> 10:47.750
I'm not a criminal.

10:48.833 --> 10:50.458
Besides, if I were responsible,

10:50.500 --> 10:52.791
why would I be standing here in it with you?

10:52.833 --> 10:56.500
I think I might have an idea who sent it your way, though.

10:58.041 --> 10:59.208
Whoa!

11:03.625 --> 11:05.541
Why are you protecting me?

11:05.583 --> 11:07.250
It's... complicated.

11:07.291 --> 11:09.916
Also, I'm pretty sure I can't fight weather.

11:11.791 --> 11:14.583
Then help me get anyone still outdoors to safety instead.

11:33.791 --> 11:37.166
In what world is this boy a champion?

11:37.208 --> 11:39.166
Leave her alone!

11:39.208 --> 11:45.333
Being a champion is about defending those who can't defend themselves.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.083
No!

12:18.041 --> 12:21.375
Ooh, I'm afraid that's going to leave a mark.

12:21.416 --> 12:24.291
No worse than yours, fiend.

12:26.125 --> 12:29.291
Use the last of your power to fix me,

12:29.333 --> 12:32.000
and I'll let the boy live.

12:43.291 --> 12:47.500
I'd rather use it to make sure you never find this castle

12:47.541 --> 12:50.750
or the boy ever again.

12:50.791 --> 12:52.083
No!

13:10.541 --> 13:12.500
I'm guessing this isn't the best time

13:12.541 --> 13:15.125
to ask for help bringing Havoc back into the castle?

13:15.166 --> 13:20.458
As Guardians, we do what we must to protect Grayskull and Eternia,

13:20.500 --> 13:22.625
even if it means bringing a part of nature

13:22.666 --> 13:26.208
as chaotic and dangerous as Havoc back into this castle.

13:26.250 --> 13:27.958
I-I'm sorry.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.458
You've been through enough with Havoc already.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.750
I'll find another way to track Keldor.

13:32.791 --> 13:34.666
No.

13:34.708 --> 13:36.500
His power grows.

13:36.541 --> 13:38.250
I have felt it in the ether.

13:38.291 --> 13:40.958
It crawls across the globe as we speak.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.375
The interference on my map?

13:43.416 --> 13:48.125
A harmful by-product of whatever weapon Keldor is forging.

13:48.166 --> 13:51.208
I know this is scary for you, but if we can figure out

13:51.250 --> 13:53.708
where he's building whatever he's building,

13:53.750 --> 13:58.166
we can stop him before he uses Havoc to hurt anyone else.

13:58.208 --> 14:02.166
You remind me of someone I knew long ago.

14:02.208 --> 14:03.541
Who?

14:03.583 --> 14:05.875
Me. Let's get to work.

14:29.875 --> 14:34.166
R'Qazz can push him off the cliff while he isn't looking.

14:34.208 --> 14:38.041
Not before we've gotten our Havoc, woodsman.

14:38.083 --> 14:40.666
It is taking a while, though, isn't it?

14:40.708 --> 14:43.291
I was about to eat a sandwich.

14:45.833 --> 14:48.541
Hmm. I once knew a Sand Witch.

15:09.666 --> 15:11.708
Maybe we should take cover in the lower wards.

15:11.750 --> 15:14.458
One of the other Masters of the Universe used to live there.

15:14.500 --> 15:18.291
"Other" Masters? You shared the Power of Grayskull?

15:18.333 --> 15:22.416
Why is it even illegal to use an awesome power to do awesome things?

15:22.458 --> 15:25.625
Few are responsible enough to wield the Power,

15:25.666 --> 15:28.083
even fewer, to wield it for good.

15:28.125 --> 15:31.916
No King of Eternos has ever trusted himself with it,

15:31.958 --> 15:33.416
not even me.

15:35.750 --> 15:38.916
Your Grace, what do we do?

15:38.958 --> 15:41.041
Follow me, citizens.

15:55.166 --> 15:57.166
Oh, no! My boy!

16:01.791 --> 16:04.125
No!

16:10.708 --> 16:13.250
Don't you have some kind of tech that can help with this?

16:13.291 --> 16:16.833
The Royal Engineers have been working to complete a defense shield

16:16.875 --> 16:20.041
that could withstand unstable elements like this,

16:20.083 --> 16:23.750
a project started by my former man-at-arms.

16:29.291 --> 16:32.250
Kronis is working for your brother now, you know.

16:32.291 --> 16:34.750
So it was you who left me the note

16:34.791 --> 16:38.625
claiming that my brother was still alive after all this time.

16:41.125 --> 16:43.416
Why did you think Keldor was ever gone at all?

16:44.875 --> 16:47.750
Keldor stole my son and rode out to Grayskull

16:47.791 --> 16:51.416
to claim for himself the Power you now flaunt.

17:00.041 --> 17:04.041
When the Red Legion and I arrived to rescue Adam, my boy,

17:04.083 --> 17:06.166
the castle was gone,

17:06.208 --> 17:10.041
the Sword of Power all that remained in its stead.

17:10.083 --> 17:14.291
Have you maybe considered that since Keldor is alive,

17:14.333 --> 17:16.416
Adam might be alive too?

17:16.458 --> 17:19.541
I don't know that even this king's heart could bear it

17:19.583 --> 17:22.083
if that turned out to be false.

17:22.125 --> 17:25.333
What if I told you... it was true?

17:25.375 --> 17:28.083
Why should I believe a thing you say?

17:32.916 --> 17:35.416
Get inside! Save yourself!

17:35.458 --> 17:38.666
Stay away from my father!

17:40.750 --> 17:42.541
Lightning Strike!

17:59.333 --> 18:01.416
What did you call me just now?

18:04.333 --> 18:06.375
Hey... Dad.

18:10.625 --> 18:13.625
My--my son!

18:13.666 --> 18:15.500
Nice to meet you, I guess.

18:17.208 --> 18:19.041
"Meet" me?

18:19.083 --> 18:22.375
I don't remember much from... before.

18:24.083 --> 18:26.000
It's a miracle you're safe, Sire!

18:26.041 --> 18:28.000
Fear not.

18:28.041 --> 18:31.166
We'll get you back up to speed at my side as a proper prince in no time.

18:32.583 --> 18:34.166
I don't know that I want to be a prince.

18:34.208 --> 18:35.583
Nonsense.

18:35.625 --> 18:37.416
But first things first.

18:37.458 --> 18:40.291
You and your allies need to relinquish the Power of Grayskull

18:40.333 --> 18:42.125
and lay down your arms.

18:42.166 --> 18:46.291
The Power of Grayskull just saved you and everyone else here.

18:46.333 --> 18:47.583
I'm not abusing it.

18:47.625 --> 18:49.458
I'm using it for good.

18:49.500 --> 18:52.250
No one is above the law...

18:52.291 --> 18:53.958
not even my son.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.541
Your Highness!

18:55.583 --> 18:57.208
Is that the prince?

18:57.250 --> 18:58.625
It doesn't matter.

18:58.666 --> 19:02.000
Take that sword back by any means necessary.

19:02.041 --> 19:03.875
So it's gonna be like that, huh?

19:06.833 --> 19:09.708
Only if you choose for it to be.

19:12.833 --> 19:15.125
By the Power of Grayskull...

19:15.166 --> 19:16.375
Wait! Stop!

19:34.291 --> 19:37.583
...I have the Power!

19:42.791 --> 19:44.833
I'm not coming home.

19:49.250 --> 19:51.250
My boy.

20:04.250 --> 20:06.875
I assume you went to see the king.

20:06.916 --> 20:08.500
Where's Teela?

20:24.958 --> 20:26.916
We found Keldor,

20:26.958 --> 20:30.166
despite all the Havoc interference cast off by whatever he's building.

20:31.875 --> 20:34.208
That storm was just interference?

20:34.250 --> 20:36.083
It could have destroyed the city.

20:36.125 --> 20:40.416
Keldor is manipulating powers he does not truly understand.

20:40.458 --> 20:43.916
Then we don't have time to wait for him to do something on purpose.

20:43.958 --> 20:45.833
Where is my uncle?

20:45.875 --> 20:48.833
The people of Eternos don't deserve whatever Keldor's planning.

20:48.875 --> 20:50.333
He's in the Fright Zone, Adam.

20:52.708 --> 20:54.625
Should we send the army instead?

20:54.666 --> 20:56.083
You are the prince, after all.

20:56.125 --> 20:57.791
No.

20:57.833 --> 20:59.708
We're on our own.

20:59.750 --> 21:02.250
Saving Eternia is up to us.

21:07.666 --> 21:10.375
Such power.

21:15.625 --> 21:17.333
R'Qazz likes.

21:21.583 --> 21:23.541
Least mine ain't squeakin' no more.

21:27.416 --> 21:30.625
"Thank you, Skeletor."

21:31.666 --> 21:34.250
Thank you, Skeletor.

21:36.416 --> 21:40.166
Ah, it would seem the brats have pinpointed our location.

21:40.208 --> 21:44.000
What kind of trap would this be if they didn't?
