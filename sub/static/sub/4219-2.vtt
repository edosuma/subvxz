WEBVTT

00:00.626 --> 00:02.085
- What is it?
- 1751.

00:02.211 --> 00:03.795
That's my badge number.

00:03.921 --> 00:05.880
We have reason to believe
that Kelly Severide

00:06.006 --> 00:07.924
has gotten
the attention of an arsonist.

00:08.050 --> 00:10.677
Previously on Chicago Fire...

00:10.803 --> 00:15.056
I am going to have to close two more
houses. Your house is on the short list.

00:15.182 --> 00:17.308
- You must be the new guys.
- Jeff Clarke, sir.

00:17.434 --> 00:21.229
I was hoping that you could
be my eyes and ears over there.

00:21.355 --> 00:24.065
I would like to announce
that I am running for union president,

00:24.191 --> 00:26.025
and I would appreciate your support.

00:26.151 --> 00:27.527
Casey, move!

00:30.280 --> 00:32.448
You said the baby's coming on
Thanksgiving.

00:32.574 --> 00:34.283
When was the last time you guys...

00:34.410 --> 00:36.994
For you to imply that it's...
it's not mine?

00:37.121 --> 00:39.288
- How you doing?
- I'm doing just great.

00:39.415 --> 00:41.958
- Be safe.
- Yes, sir.

00:43.627 --> 00:45.545
- DUI.
- Where's the driver?

00:45.671 --> 00:47.004
- Heather?
- The kids...

00:47.131 --> 00:48.381
The kids are at the babysitter.

00:48.507 --> 00:51.259
- I got it!
- I'm so sorry.

00:56.432 --> 01:00.184
- Hey.
- You're... you're back early.

01:00.310 --> 01:03.229
Yeah, two weeks of my mom's
"natural birthing" lectures was enough.

01:03.355 --> 01:05.815
Come here. Feel this.

01:05.941 --> 01:09.986
Crazy kicking for the last two days.

01:10.112 --> 01:12.321
The baby missed you, I think.

01:12.448 --> 01:15.533
I... I'm gonna be late,
so I better get going,

01:15.659 --> 01:18.703
but, um, we'll catch up after shift?

01:18.829 --> 01:20.621
- Sounds good.
- Okay.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.964
Yeah, I'm just looking
for any kind of an update.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.967
I don't have one.
Everything is up in the air right now.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.386
Okay, well, I still have the kids here.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.013
Where do you keep the cereal?

01:37.139 --> 01:39.682
Uh, call me back as soon
as you hear anything.

01:39.808 --> 01:44.395
Uh, yeah. All right.

01:44.521 --> 01:46.481
I'm gonna make you guys
some lunch for school.

01:46.607 --> 01:49.692
- What about breakfast?
- Yes. Good point.

01:49.818 --> 01:52.737
- When's Mom coming back from her trip?
- Soon, really soon.

01:52.863 --> 01:56.115
Ben, just... here,
put that stuff back, buddy.

01:56.241 --> 01:58.159
You guys need to get dressed.
We're late.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.620
When you talk to mom,
tell her we're ready to go home, okay?

02:00.746 --> 02:03.956
Evie will pick you up from school today.
Oh!

02:04.082 --> 02:08.252
Okay.  I got this.
Don't worry.

02:08.378 --> 02:10.463
I'll get it!

02:10.589 --> 02:12.799
Thanks, Ben.

02:12.925 --> 02:14.884
- You missed some.
- Thanks, Griffin.

02:17.262 --> 02:18.262
Boo!

02:18.388 --> 02:19.972
- Gabby.
- Hey.

02:20.098 --> 02:23.059
I figured I'd stop by on my way to work,
see how everyone's doing.

02:23.185 --> 02:25.311
- I'm starving.
- All right.

02:25.437 --> 02:27.730
Whoever runs to the bedroom first

02:27.856 --> 02:31.484
and gets dressed in under
two minutes gets one of these.

02:31.610 --> 02:34.946
I'm timing you. Go! I'm timing you!
Get on it!

02:36.907 --> 02:38.241
Impressive.

02:38.367 --> 02:40.743
Did you talk to Antonio?

02:40.869 --> 02:42.578
I'm not getting anything
from the attorney.

02:42.704 --> 02:44.413
Yeah, he says that Heather
has a good chance

02:44.540 --> 02:48.376
of getting out on probation soon.
First offense, single mother...

02:48.502 --> 02:50.211
Cut it out! Stop it, Ben!

02:50.337 --> 02:51.879
Guys!

02:52.005 --> 02:54.757
I hope he's right.

03:05.894 --> 03:09.939
- Kelly.
- These arsons we've been fighting...

03:10.065 --> 03:11.941
MO matches up with John Westminster.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.652
That's a guy that my dad helped
put away a few years back.

03:14.778 --> 03:18.614
Yeah, yeah. "Big John." I remember. So?

03:18.740 --> 03:21.784
So I called DOC and it turns out
he was released from prison a month ago,

03:21.910 --> 03:23.327
right before the fires started.

03:23.453 --> 03:25.663
So you think he's looking
to settle the score with Benny

03:25.789 --> 03:27.248
by coming after you?

03:27.374 --> 03:30.334
- I think it's worth looking into.
- Sure.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.920
Anything for Benny Severide's kid.

03:40.971 --> 03:44.724
I don't think you understand the
seriousness of this situation, Chief.

03:44.850 --> 03:47.184
Oh, I can assure you I do.

03:47.311 --> 03:50.354
Then explain why you have yet
to input any data into The Wizard.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.941
I will, Ms McLeod,
as soon as I get five minutes.

03:54.067 --> 03:58.029
No, today, this shift...

03:59.740 --> 04:01.032
Unless you'd like me to get

04:01.158 --> 04:03.868
a relief battalion Chief
to come in to do it for you.

04:03.994 --> 04:08.039
Hmm. I'll get it done.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.294
Good.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.129
Thank you, Chief.

04:31.355 --> 04:33.731
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:33.857 --> 04:35.608
So the management company
called to remind us

04:35.734 --> 04:38.069
that the new tenants are
gonna move in on the 16th.

04:38.195 --> 04:40.988
Yeah, Renee and I can finish
packing up this weekend.

04:41.114 --> 04:45.368
So does that mean you
talked to her about the baby?

04:46.954 --> 04:50.456
She just got back to town a few
hours ago. Give me a break, okay?

04:55.963 --> 04:58.756
51 has the best food in town.

04:58.882 --> 05:01.634
- Where'd you learn how to cook?
- My family owns a restaurant.

05:01.760 --> 05:05.888
- Been behind a grill since I was a kid.
- Any update on Heather's friend Jen?

05:06.014 --> 05:08.099
Still in critical condition.

05:08.225 --> 05:09.684
Casey, how are the boys?

05:09.810 --> 05:11.686
As far as they know, mom's on a trip.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.938
Hopefully they'll be home soon.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.856
If it hadn't been for her,
they'd have shown up

05:15.983 --> 05:18.526
to school an hour late wearing pyjamas.

05:18.652 --> 05:19.986
Yeah, that smelled like beer.

05:24.700 --> 05:28.577
Truck 81, Squad 3, Engine 51,
Ambulance 61.

05:28.704 --> 05:32.331
Multi-vehicle accident, interstate 90
at the Eisenhower expressway.

05:46.930 --> 05:50.891
Hey! Hey, over here! Over here! Hey.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.853
Just before the house went over,
I saw a motorcycle passing on the right.

05:58.817 --> 06:00.359
Go.

06:06.616 --> 06:08.492
Sir?

06:08.618 --> 06:10.161
I can feel his leg, just not a pulse.

06:10.287 --> 06:13.748
Get me some cribbing and air bags.
We need to lift and stabilize this home.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.541
You got it.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.293
Boden, you hear that?

06:17.419 --> 06:20.129
Otis, Mouch, grab me a ladder.
There's someone else inside.

06:20.255 --> 06:21.422
Copy.

06:24.926 --> 06:27.595
- Severide, where do you want it?
- Guys, right there.

06:31.683 --> 06:33.559
Clarke, follow me.

06:41.818 --> 06:45.071
Located the victim. Send me up a line.

06:48.617 --> 06:50.785
Ma'am? Can you hear me?

06:50.911 --> 06:52.328
Airway's clear. She's breathing.

06:55.332 --> 06:57.750
All right, I'm on line.
All right, going down.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.760
- Dawson.
- Yeah?

07:11.681 --> 07:14.391
Back door's open.

07:16.853 --> 07:19.605
Casey! We got a missing kid.

07:19.731 --> 07:22.483
- Ran from the car.
- Got it.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.529
- What have you got, Severide?
- He's in bad shape.

07:26.655 --> 07:28.447
We need to find a way to
get him out of here quick.

07:28.573 --> 07:30.491
From the size of the seat,
the kid could be anywhere

07:30.617 --> 07:32.368
from, like, three to six years old.

07:39.126 --> 07:43.420
Clarke... Send me down a Sawzall,
then bring the Stokes basket.

07:43.547 --> 07:45.172
Got it. Send up a Sawzall.

07:49.052 --> 07:50.344
Got it.

07:55.851 --> 07:57.393
Up on green.

08:05.527 --> 08:08.028
Found the owner of the boot.

08:08.155 --> 08:11.991
The other victim's trapped beneath 'em.
We need those air bags now!

08:34.806 --> 08:36.432
There.

08:38.685 --> 08:42.062
Air bags are up. Motorcyclist's legs
should be free, Lieutenant.

08:42.189 --> 08:45.357
One, two, three, up!

08:51.239 --> 08:53.449
All right, guys,
get ready to lift him up.

08:53.575 --> 08:55.910
Hey, buddy. It's okay.

08:57.829 --> 09:00.581
I'm Matt. What's your name?

09:02.667 --> 09:04.376
Colin.

09:04.502 --> 09:06.795
Come on out.

09:08.882 --> 09:12.051
Come on.
Let's get you safe and sound.

09:28.652 --> 09:32.988
This Wizard program is
the most convoluted...

09:33.114 --> 09:34.907
Yeah, we should record this.

09:35.033 --> 09:37.910
Use it to show how ineffective
McLeod's systems are.

09:38.036 --> 09:42.289
This crazy budget tightening has
nothing to do with saving lives.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.541
Now you're talking like a union
president.

09:44.668 --> 09:46.460
You will not record this.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.046
Yeah, you know what?
You need to get out there,

09:49.172 --> 09:52.049
you know, and start your campaign.
Greg Sullivan's already in high gear.

09:52.175 --> 09:54.885
I got one of his flyers
in the mail yesterday.

09:55.011 --> 09:56.929
Me too. Nice, high-gloss paper.

09:57.055 --> 09:59.848
- Guy's got campaign funds.
- Nah, forget the funds.

09:59.975 --> 10:02.851
You know what, the most valuable
commodity in any election

10:02.978 --> 10:05.604
is the candidate themselves.

10:05.730 --> 10:10.234
Visit the firehouses, present ideas,
take questions...

10:10.986 --> 10:12.611
...town hall-style.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.949
It's not a bad idea, Herrmann.

10:17.075 --> 10:19.410
Will the two of you kindly
take your business elsewhere?

10:25.000 --> 10:28.168
- Evie.
- Mr Casey, I'm so sorry to bother you.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.337
- Where are Griffin and Ben?
- Outside.

10:30.463 --> 10:33.215
My daughter has a sore throat,
could be strep.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.175
I need to take her to the doctor.

10:35.302 --> 10:36.302
Oh.

10:36.428 --> 10:39.471
I tried to get them to come inside,
but there's a problem with Griffin.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.687
Griffin, come inside.
We'll give you guys a VIP tour.

10:46.813 --> 10:49.064
He can go in. I'm staying outside.

10:49.190 --> 10:52.484
- Hey, Dawson!
- Hey, guys.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.321
Hi.

10:56.948 --> 10:59.241
- I'll take Ben inside.
- Thanks.

11:03.747 --> 11:09.001
- Hey! Ben Darden's in the house!
- Hey, you little rug rat!

11:09.127 --> 11:11.045
Look at you!

11:11.171 --> 11:13.422
How you doing? You're getting so big.

11:13.548 --> 11:16.717
Come on, we'll show you around the
joint. How about that, huh?

11:16.843 --> 11:20.637
Is that all of Chicago?
Is my house on there?

11:20.764 --> 11:21.722
Yep, it is.

11:21.848 --> 11:24.892
It shows us every street
and address in the city.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.686
Right there, that's the
"dangerous buildings" list.

11:27.812 --> 11:29.021
Every station has one.

11:29.147 --> 11:33.192
It shows us all the buildings that are
really tricky to fight fires in.

11:33.318 --> 11:36.904
Yo, you want to come check out
the truck?

11:46.456 --> 11:49.458
Ben's an idiot for acting
like this place is so cool.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.295
Your father loved it here.

11:53.421 --> 11:56.548
- I just want to go home, okay?
- I know.

12:03.640 --> 12:08.102
How about this?
I'll cancel my construction job.

12:08.228 --> 12:12.689
After shift, we'll go down to the pier.
You grab whatever you want for lunch.

12:19.364 --> 12:21.073
Can I go up on the ladder?

12:21.199 --> 12:24.451
Uh, I... I think we're gonna have
to check on that one, partner.

12:26.621 --> 12:28.831
Rules say no visitors in the aerial...

12:30.667 --> 12:32.960
But then again,
you're not just any visitor, huh?

12:33.086 --> 12:35.921
Chief, what do you say?

12:37.173 --> 12:38.882
Ah, go ahead.

12:52.689 --> 12:54.815
Hey.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.859
We barely got a chance
to say hello this morning,

12:56.985 --> 13:01.488
and you seem so stressed,
so I thought I'd come and cheer you up.

13:02.991 --> 13:08.370
Now, my parents are a little too excited
about becoming grandparents.

13:09.873 --> 13:14.084
Oh... look at this.

13:14.210 --> 13:17.129
Aw, come on!
Isn't this the sweetest?

13:23.803 --> 13:25.053
Kelly...

13:28.057 --> 13:29.725
What's going on with you?

13:34.272 --> 13:39.735
Look, you know that
I love you no matter what, right?

13:42.947 --> 13:45.949
When you moved to Spain,
we said that we'd keep in touch

13:46.075 --> 13:48.118
but that we wouldn't be exclusive.

13:54.876 --> 13:59.087
Is there any chance that this baby...

14:14.771 --> 14:17.648
Lieutenant? Arson just called.

14:17.774 --> 14:20.734
Wanted to let you know that the cops
have Big John in custody.

14:23.446 --> 14:24.696
Thanks.

14:36.167 --> 14:38.126
Hey, detectives are talking to him now.

14:38.253 --> 14:40.170
The bastard's even twitchier
are than I remember.

14:40.296 --> 14:42.005
Got anything solid
tying him to the fires?

14:42.131 --> 14:43.757
Nothing.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.179
Hey, look. It's the arson guy's son.

14:49.305 --> 14:51.848
- Two buildings up in flames?
- Ooh!

14:51.975 --> 14:53.892
Do you know how many people
you almost killed?

14:54.018 --> 14:56.603
- Huh, how many of my own men, huh?
- Get away from me!

14:56.729 --> 14:58.230
- Kelly! Kelly!
- Get him away!

14:58.356 --> 15:00.107
- Get him away from me!
- Get him out of here!

15:02.485 --> 15:04.403
Hey, I looped you in out
of respect for your father,

15:04.529 --> 15:06.905
as a courtesy. You understand?

15:14.205 --> 15:17.916
I'm telling you.
Renee looked pissed running out of here!

15:18.042 --> 15:20.127
What if I was wrong about the due date?

15:20.253 --> 15:22.546
That would be bad, Shay.

15:22.672 --> 15:25.549
I don't think I was,
but I'm not a frickin' obstetrician.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.467
Taking too long!

15:27.594 --> 15:29.177
Remember, as McLeod said,

15:29.304 --> 15:33.974
"Only 42 ounces of potable water
per employee per week."

15:34.767 --> 15:37.311
Sounds like you saved the day
with Griffin and Ben this morning.

15:39.063 --> 15:43.275
Yeah. I love those boys,
but hanging there with Casey?

15:43.401 --> 15:46.361
It's not exactly helping me move on.

15:47.655 --> 15:50.157
You know what? I have been traveling
in too small a circle,

15:50.283 --> 15:51.491
if you know what I'm saying.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.869
The world does not start
and end at Firehouse 51.

15:53.995 --> 15:56.663
- That is so damn true.
- Let's go!

15:56.789 --> 15:58.749
I have seen you both naked
a hundred times!

15:58.875 --> 16:00.751
Just open the door,
so I can take a shower!

16:00.960 --> 16:02.502
We really need to get out more.

16:02.629 --> 16:05.964
Yes. Yes, we do.

16:07.342 --> 16:08.342
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:08.468 --> 16:11.845
- Thanks for coming down.
- Thanks for calling.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.140
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

16:15.266 --> 16:19.269
Could I get one of those too, please?
Thank you.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.858
Well, did you...
Did you talk to the guys at arson?

16:24.984 --> 16:26.360
Yeah. Yeah.

16:26.486 --> 16:29.571
As soon as Big John was
on their radar, Rome called me.

16:29.697 --> 16:31.531
Did you know they had him in custody?

16:31.658 --> 16:33.867
- They let him walk?
- Yeah.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.912
I heard that. The thing is,
I'm not so sure he's the guy.

16:37.038 --> 16:40.749
MO might be similar,
but I could tell him pretty well.

16:40.875 --> 16:43.669
I don't see him having the balls
to set a car on fire

16:43.795 --> 16:45.045
right outside a station house.

16:45.171 --> 16:46.338
You're wrong.

16:48.466 --> 16:50.676
All due respect, I think you're wrong.

16:50.802 --> 16:53.136
The guy, he...
He knew me the minute he saw me.

16:53.262 --> 16:54.846
I... he knew I was your son.

16:57.975 --> 17:02.813
Okay. Well, let me get in it with arson.

17:02.939 --> 17:06.650
- See what I can find out.
- Yeah.

17:10.446 --> 17:11.863
It's good?

17:11.989 --> 17:13.782
Perfection.

17:16.119 --> 17:20.038
Hey, you know Cruz is making
a move on your cousin, right?

17:20.164 --> 17:26.837
Yeah. I would kick him out, but he's
the only regular customer we have.

17:31.884 --> 17:35.512
Well, if it isn't
Mr Long Island iced tea.

17:35.638 --> 17:38.306
Mock all you want,
but that drink suits this place.

17:38.433 --> 17:40.934
So you're saying this place is outdated,

17:41.060 --> 17:43.395
and we only exist
to get you drunk quick?

17:43.521 --> 17:45.147
No.

17:45.273 --> 17:50.360
More that you're fun
and sweet and unpretentious.

17:51.612 --> 17:52.863
Nice recovery.

18:00.955 --> 18:04.833
There's a scotch tasting
happening Friday night

18:04.959 --> 18:06.585
at a place in Wicker Park.

18:08.629 --> 18:11.757
Would you want to join me?

18:15.303 --> 18:16.887
I'd love to.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.349
There was a definite hesitation
before he said yes.

18:21.476 --> 18:23.185
But point being he said yes.

18:23.311 --> 18:25.020
You should come too.
Bring someone.

18:25.146 --> 18:29.149
Calm down. I'm gonna be packing
all weekend. I can't.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.526
Boo.

18:33.404 --> 18:34.613
Who's Amy R?

18:34.739 --> 18:37.699
Oh, the real estate agent I'm meeting
with tomorrow to see apartments,

18:37.825 --> 18:40.619
and I think she's hitting on me,
but I can't tell.

18:40.745 --> 18:45.665
It's kind of amazing
how bad you are at sussing out lesbians.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.250
I know, right?

18:50.129 --> 18:51.671
She's in here! She's in here!

19:01.891 --> 19:04.226
I was in the other room,
and I heard a thump.

19:04.352 --> 19:06.311
She must have fallen down the stairs.

19:06.437 --> 19:08.104
She's breathing.

19:08.231 --> 19:11.191
Let's get a c-collar on her
and get her on the backboard.

19:14.862 --> 19:17.280
Did you... did you move her at all?

19:17.406 --> 19:19.282
No. She was right there
when I found her.

19:22.870 --> 19:25.914
Oh, my God, Phoebe.
What did you do to my sister?

19:26.040 --> 19:28.291
I didn't do anything. She fell.
Tell him! She fell!

19:28.417 --> 19:29.793
He beats her up! Did he tell you that?

19:29.919 --> 19:31.336
- He did this to her.
- Okay, sir.

19:31.462 --> 19:32.838
- We gotta...
- Hey! Hey!

19:34.549 --> 19:37.092
This is Ambulance 61.
We need immediate police assistance.

19:40.263 --> 19:43.682
Hey, buddy?

19:43.808 --> 19:45.350
We can't get your sister to the hospital

19:45.476 --> 19:47.686
unless you stop that
and move out of the way, all right?

19:47.812 --> 19:49.229
He's gonna kill him!

19:57.446 --> 19:59.698
- Oh, God.
- Hey!

19:59.824 --> 20:02.868
Move it. Oh, God.

20:04.245 --> 20:07.080
I told you cops he'd kill her
if you didn't stop him.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.666
Nobody listened!

20:09.792 --> 20:12.961
Dispatch, we need a second ambo
at 4042, Larrabee.

20:14.839 --> 20:16.923
Please don't let my baby sister die!

20:19.802 --> 20:21.928
You think that woman knew her husband
was a total scumbag

20:22.054 --> 20:23.513
before or after she married him?

20:23.639 --> 20:25.807
He could have pretended to
be Prince Charming for years

20:25.933 --> 20:28.685
and she wakes up too late
next to a monster under the bridge.

20:28.811 --> 20:30.520
Boy.

20:30.646 --> 20:33.148
No, you know you are backing
me into a corner here.

20:33.274 --> 20:36.443
- What happens when that...
- Oh, sorry to interrupt.

20:36.569 --> 20:40.113
Hold on. Hang on a second.
I have to go in the other room.

20:44.785 --> 20:46.286
Hey, you catch any of that?

20:46.412 --> 20:48.204
Clarke was lighting
somebody up on the phone.

20:49.707 --> 20:51.458
Personal business, I guess.

20:52.752 --> 20:56.588
I guess.
Something seems off about that guy.

20:58.758 --> 21:02.093
Something besides him
taking your spot on Squad?

21:04.680 --> 21:07.015
Remember, it's not a speech.

21:07.141 --> 21:09.809
It's a town hall,
so you have to be comfortable

21:09.936 --> 21:13.396
and conversational
to hold the audience's interest,

21:13.522 --> 21:16.191
and that's where these come in.

21:17.443 --> 21:19.319
They're called "key cards."

21:19.445 --> 21:24.449
They're used by some of the most
successful speakers in the world.

21:24.575 --> 21:26.034
Key cards.

21:26.160 --> 21:29.579
It's stuff that we've all heard
you spout time and time again,

21:29.705 --> 21:31.873
you know, when you're getting
yourself all worked up.

21:31.999 --> 21:37.295
I'd be more comfortable
and conversational if I was sitting.

21:37.421 --> 21:40.173
Oh, well, then let's get you a stool.
Hey!

21:41.884 --> 21:44.386
The town hall seat of choice.

21:50.518 --> 21:52.227
Okay. I can work with this.

21:52.353 --> 21:55.605
Great. Give it a shot.

21:57.733 --> 21:59.859
Three man trucks.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.653
And?

22:03.364 --> 22:05.907
What are your feelings about that?

22:07.410 --> 22:09.744
Only a pencil-pushing bureaucrat

22:09.870 --> 22:12.998
would think a three-man truck
is a good idea.

22:13.124 --> 22:15.458
You know, every study they've done shows

22:15.584 --> 22:18.086
Search and Rescue times
go right down the toilet

22:18.212 --> 22:20.922
whenever you have
fewer than five guys on a truck.

22:21.048 --> 22:22.757
It's common sense.

22:25.302 --> 22:28.847
"Fitness bonuses," "reduced benefits."

22:28.973 --> 22:31.975
All stuff I have very
strong opinions about.

22:33.060 --> 22:34.853
My brains, your face.

22:34.979 --> 22:37.814
We can take this campaign all the way.

22:41.193 --> 22:44.612
Thanks for coming over.
I really appreciate the help.

22:44.739 --> 22:46.489
Yeah. No problem. They're great kids.

22:46.615 --> 22:48.324
Griffin barely ate.

22:49.660 --> 22:50.577
Well, I don't blame him.

22:50.703 --> 22:53.538
He's old enough to know when grown-ups
are hiding something from him.

22:53.664 --> 22:55.123
He'll be happy to get home.

22:55.249 --> 22:57.751
Good chance
Friday's my last night with him.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.878
You want to come over for dinner?

23:00.004 --> 23:02.297
They're a lot happier
when you're around.

23:03.424 --> 23:05.300
We could order Chinese food,
get a movie.

23:07.553 --> 23:11.097
I can't.
I can't stay for a movie.

23:12.558 --> 23:15.185
I have a dinner thing.

23:16.729 --> 23:20.482
Oh, well...
Somebody has a hot date.

23:20.608 --> 23:22.734
Mm, no. It's just a thing.

23:30.493 --> 23:31.826
Hey.

23:36.499 --> 23:37.874
Antonio.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.086
I just got some bad news.

23:42.922 --> 23:46.424
Heather's friend Jen...
She didn't make it.

23:51.138 --> 23:52.430
That's terrible.

23:52.556 --> 23:55.350
Yeah, and it changes everything.

23:55.476 --> 23:58.394
Heather's looking at
a manslaughter charge now.

24:02.525 --> 24:07.070
Jen, uh...
She taught me how to roller-skate.

24:08.656 --> 24:11.032
- I've known her since...
- It was an accident.

24:16.789 --> 24:20.083
The lawyer said I'd spend
the next five to ten years in here

24:20.209 --> 24:22.001
unless I made a plea deal.

24:22.128 --> 24:24.045
They don't know that for sure.

24:24.171 --> 24:27.590
It was a first offense
and you're a single mom.

24:27.716 --> 24:29.509
I took the deal.

24:29.635 --> 24:30.718
What?

24:30.845 --> 24:34.556
I can't risk being away from my boys
for their entire childhood.

24:37.518 --> 24:39.018
I can't.

24:41.605 --> 24:46.651
I pled guilty to DUI manslaughter,
which is 15 months.

24:50.656 --> 24:52.490
You know that before Andy died,

24:52.616 --> 24:55.910
we put you in our wills
as the boys' guardian

24:56.036 --> 24:58.204
if something happened to us both.

25:01.083 --> 25:05.461
Can you take care of Griffin
and Ben while I'm in here?

25:23.314 --> 25:25.899
Guys. Guys.

25:26.025 --> 25:31.821
I, uh... I just wanted to give everybody
an update on the Darden boys.

25:35.576 --> 25:39.954
Turns out they're gonna be living with
me for the next 15 months or so.

25:41.916 --> 25:45.043
The thing is I'm gonna need some help.
I, uh...

25:45.169 --> 25:47.337
Say no more. We're there.

25:51.008 --> 25:54.510
Whatever you need.
They're our boys too.

26:02.311 --> 26:03.519
Thanks.

26:04.688 --> 26:07.482
You got this, buddy.
You're no Greg Sullivan.

26:07.608 --> 26:09.025
You're a fireman's fireman.

26:14.949 --> 26:19.035
- Where's the stool?
- Hey, you guys got any stools?

26:21.622 --> 26:25.500
- I'm not comfortable, Herrmann.
- Hey, take a deep breath.

26:25.626 --> 26:27.835
You're gonna be great.

26:27.962 --> 26:30.755
Hey, guys!
Uh, can we get your attention over here?

26:30.881 --> 26:33.299
Just for a minute. Come on.

26:37.054 --> 26:38.680
Yeah, thanks. Uh...

26:39.890 --> 26:43.393
I'm Randall McHolland and I am
running for union president.

26:44.353 --> 26:45.770
I'm here for, uh...

26:48.023 --> 26:49.732
to talk about some issues.

26:52.403 --> 26:54.487
Three-man trucks.

27:01.370 --> 27:02.954
Three-man trucks?

27:04.373 --> 27:07.333
Which studies show are far more
dangerous

27:07.459 --> 27:09.711
than five-or six-man trucks.

27:11.755 --> 27:16.134
Uh, wellness programs...
dos and don'ts.

27:17.511 --> 27:21.389
Uh, dos... and don'ts.

27:23.517 --> 27:26.227
Try... try...

27:28.480 --> 27:30.273
Oh, thank God.

27:31.984 --> 27:33.401
- Sorry about that.
- See ya.

27:35.070 --> 27:37.447
Don't worry about it. Okay?

27:37.573 --> 27:40.575
I mean, this is just one
of 98 houses in the city.

27:40.701 --> 27:46.164
Oh, actually now that McLeod has
dropped her ax, it's 97 and counting.

27:46.290 --> 27:49.208
I mean, who knows how
many more before she's...

27:50.961 --> 27:54.380
Now you're gonna get all worked up?

27:57.801 --> 28:02.138
Bedroom has southern exposure,
so it's really light in the mornings,

28:02.264 --> 28:04.640
which is not so great for hangovers.

28:04.767 --> 28:10.646
True, also not something
the average realtor would mention.

28:10.773 --> 28:12.690
Guess I'm not the average realtor.

28:13.525 --> 28:14.901
Here, come check this out.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.906
Built-in wine fridge.

28:21.408 --> 28:22.992
Wow. Nice.

28:23.118 --> 28:25.703
I have an ex-girlfriend
who would have loved that.

28:27.122 --> 28:29.332
Sounds like a girl with good taste.

28:31.585 --> 28:34.921
Not really. She ended up dumping me
and going back to her husband.

28:35.047 --> 28:38.591
Ugh, I'm gonna bet
she's regretted it every day since.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.218
Oh, God. I hope so.

28:40.344 --> 28:42.053
Yeah.

28:42.179 --> 28:44.305
You don't have one of those, do you?

28:46.058 --> 28:47.392
A husband?

28:48.352 --> 28:50.937
Hell, no.
Not in this lifetime.

28:53.399 --> 28:54.774
Okay.

29:01.657 --> 29:03.241
Hey, you're back.

29:08.414 --> 29:10.289
What are you doing?

29:12.167 --> 29:16.754
I went and got a test done.
That's why I've been gone.

29:21.593 --> 29:27.765
I had a one-night stand...
with a guy in Spain.

29:27.891 --> 29:30.435
I thought it would help me get over you.

29:32.563 --> 29:33.938
It didn't.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.663
You were right.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.711
This baby's not yours.

30:01.133 --> 30:05.511
I know how crazy this sounds,
but I... I wasn't lying to you.

30:07.764 --> 30:10.266
And I actually convinced myself
that it was yours.

30:11.852 --> 30:13.561
It was ours.

30:24.406 --> 30:27.074
Kelly, you'll make a great father
someday.

30:27.201 --> 30:28.409
Ah...

30:34.082 --> 30:35.791
Renee.

30:45.761 --> 30:47.178
Good-bye, Kelly.

31:05.030 --> 31:06.531
Jeez.

31:08.575 --> 31:10.368
Is there anything I can do?

31:16.917 --> 31:18.876
Honestly, I just need a place to live.

31:20.671 --> 31:21.921
Our place is gone, right?

31:22.047 --> 31:27.093
Yeah, but I've got an "in"
with a great realtor

31:27.219 --> 31:30.638
and a lead on a one-bedroom
and a sweet three-bedroom.

31:30.764 --> 31:32.014
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

31:32.140 --> 31:36.727
We could take the three-bedroom and...
find a roommate later if we need.

31:38.981 --> 31:41.274
- Sound good?
- Yeah. That sounds good.

31:41.400 --> 31:42.483
All right. I'm sorry, babe.

31:45.028 --> 31:48.656
Truck 81. Squad 3. Engine 51.
Ambulance 61.

31:48.782 --> 31:51.325
Building fire. 2939, Cortland Street.

31:54.288 --> 31:55.663
That's my restaurant.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.594
Ma!

32:13.056 --> 32:14.640
Ma? Ma!

32:17.144 --> 32:18.978
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

32:19.104 --> 32:22.648
We all got out, but Peter...
Everything's gone.

32:22.774 --> 32:25.651
No. No, we're gonna save it, okay?

32:27.404 --> 32:29.989
Hey, everybody's out,
but we got to get in there.

32:30.115 --> 32:32.325
No. All occupants
are out of the building.

32:32.451 --> 32:33.534
The fire is in the trusses.

32:33.660 --> 32:36.370
We are gonna go defensive
with master streams.

32:36.496 --> 32:39.665
Nobody enters the building.
Let's get those water cannons working.

32:39.791 --> 32:41.751
Cruz and Otis, raise the aerial.

32:42.669 --> 32:43.836
Come on...

32:59.978 --> 33:01.103
Send the water!

33:06.818 --> 33:08.402
- Mills.
- Mills!

33:17.871 --> 33:20.164
Mills, I want you out of
that building right now.

33:20.290 --> 33:22.291
Do you understand me?

33:24.544 --> 33:28.130
Why is Peter in there alone?
Wallace, you get my boy out of there!

33:28.256 --> 33:30.049
You get him out of there!

33:30.175 --> 33:33.052
- Peter! Peter!
- Ingrid!

33:34.513 --> 33:36.347
We'll get him.

33:41.019 --> 33:43.771
Mayday, mayday. We have a man inside.
Squad 3 Go get him!

33:43.897 --> 33:45.898
Come on.

33:47.317 --> 33:50.903
Otis, Mouch. Charge the line
and back us up. Herrmann, with me.

34:03.458 --> 34:06.836
- What the hell were you thinking?
- Dad's medals.

34:06.962 --> 34:09.380
I do not need any damn medals.

34:09.506 --> 34:12.925
- I need you.
- Ma, come on.

34:18.557 --> 34:21.517
You freelance like that,
you will get yourself

34:21.643 --> 34:24.353
and anyone else who was willing
to go in after you killed!

34:24.479 --> 34:25.646
Do you understand me?

34:31.611 --> 34:33.612
Wasn't a kitchen fire, Chief.

35:08.523 --> 35:11.442
Ms McLeod. What brings you here?

35:11.568 --> 35:15.237
Chief Boden,
I will be making weekly check-ins

35:15.363 --> 35:17.072
with all of the houses under my aegis,

35:17.199 --> 35:20.034
so I would like to speak to
everyone, if that's all right.

35:20.160 --> 35:21.494
It'll just take a minute.

35:26.124 --> 35:28.542
- Common room, ladies and gentlemen.
- Thank you.

35:32.506 --> 35:34.256
Mills.

35:36.968 --> 35:39.178
We'll get the guy who set these fires.

35:43.975 --> 35:45.267
This won't take long.

35:45.393 --> 35:48.229
I just want to make sure
that we're all on the same page, yeah?

35:49.606 --> 35:53.651
Allowing visitors, especially children,

35:53.777 --> 35:57.822
to ride on any of the apparatus
is a serious violation

35:57.948 --> 36:00.658
of CFD policy and a potential
liability for the department.

36:00.784 --> 36:04.578
- How does she know that?
- There's a snitch in the house.

36:04.704 --> 36:06.163
You can call me a killjoy if you'd like,

36:06.289 --> 36:08.332
but the severity of this
cannot be overstated.

36:08.458 --> 36:10.334
We've got bigger problems.

36:11.878 --> 36:15.005
- First your car. Now my restaurant.
- It doesn't make sense.

36:15.131 --> 36:18.259
Mills wasn't even on the job
when Big John set those first fires.

36:18.385 --> 36:21.011
No, my pop's right. It ain't him.

36:23.431 --> 36:25.015
It's a firefighter.

36:27.519 --> 36:28.686
What makes you so sure?

36:28.812 --> 36:31.063
When I was looking
at the dangerous buildings map

36:31.189 --> 36:35.734
it hit me that all the targets
were on there and in our district.

36:35.861 --> 36:37.403
Except for the car and the diner.

36:37.529 --> 36:41.115
So it's a firefighter who's got beef
with all of us at 51?

36:49.332 --> 36:54.253
- Why can't we go home?
- I don't know. I don't know.

36:54.379 --> 36:56.589
Where's mom?

36:56.715 --> 36:59.758
- What will happen?
- I told you. I don't know.

37:03.263 --> 37:04.722
Hey, guys.

37:11.980 --> 37:16.650
It looks like you're gonna be
living here for a while with me.

37:18.653 --> 37:20.446
You promised we were going home soon.

37:21.448 --> 37:26.744
That's right, and I thought you were,
but things changed

37:26.870 --> 37:32.041
and, um, it's gonna be this way
for a while.

37:32.167 --> 37:34.126
Why can't we go home?

37:35.587 --> 37:37.212
Because your mom isn't there.

37:39.507 --> 37:41.634
The kids at school said she's in jail.

37:44.763 --> 37:46.388
She is.

37:49.225 --> 37:52.019
And I should have told you that sooner.

37:53.188 --> 37:58.067
I want to live in jail with her.
I want to see my mom.

37:59.986 --> 38:05.407
Buddy, listen. You can't live there,
but, um, you can visit.

38:07.160 --> 38:08.744
You guys can handle this.

38:10.914 --> 38:12.164
Listen...

38:15.585 --> 38:18.587
Those firefighters
and paramedics at 51?

38:20.131 --> 38:21.840
They're your family too

38:21.967 --> 38:24.176
and they're gonna help me
take good care of you guys.

38:24.302 --> 38:25.844
Okay?

38:44.948 --> 38:46.615
It's pretty cool...

38:46.741 --> 38:48.909
being able to drink in
a bar after it's closed.

38:54.874 --> 38:57.501
Grab a couple glasses,
cos I have a champagne cognac

38:57.627 --> 38:59.586
in the back we are gonna crack open.

38:59.713 --> 39:01.213
Sounds great.

39:26.364 --> 39:30.075
- Found it.
- I can't wait to try it.

39:56.061 --> 39:57.227
Hey!

40:00.857 --> 40:03.484
- Severide. How are you, buddy?
- I'm okay.

40:03.610 --> 40:05.110
Can't complain.

40:06.946 --> 40:08.155
Good.

40:08.281 --> 40:10.824
- Can I get you a beer?
- Oh, no. I'm good.

40:10.950 --> 40:12.409
I'm good right now. Thanks.

40:14.204 --> 40:17.081
So what brings you around
my stomping grounds?

40:17.207 --> 40:19.625
Well, I was looking for you, actually.

40:19.751 --> 40:21.376
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

40:21.503 --> 40:24.004
I was just thinking about some
of the fires we fought together.

40:25.090 --> 40:30.302
String of arsons on the Westside,
barbershop, couple garages,

40:30.428 --> 40:32.846
that old Italian restaurant on Diversey.

40:32.972 --> 40:36.892
- You remember?
- Vaguely, yeah.

40:39.479 --> 40:41.105
You sure you don't want one?

40:41.231 --> 40:42.981
- I'm gonna order another round.
- Nah.

40:43.108 --> 40:45.692
I'm good, but I'll tell you what.
I got your next round.

40:51.741 --> 40:55.994
So you came all the way out here
just to, uh, reminisce?

40:58.665 --> 41:01.125
There's been a bunch of similar fires
the last couple weeks.

41:02.544 --> 41:04.753
That's what brought back the memories.

41:04.879 --> 41:06.922
Reminded me
you're a damn good firefighter.

41:07.048 --> 41:10.717
Yeah. I appreciate that. I do.

41:12.595 --> 41:17.641
But I got to tell you... steady work
has been pretty hard to come by

41:17.767 --> 41:19.685
since I got pushed out of 51.

41:25.900 --> 41:27.442
Look at me.

41:29.946 --> 41:31.655
Is that why you're setting the fires?

41:35.618 --> 41:37.494
You think I'm setting the fires?

41:42.500 --> 41:43.876
Well...

41:45.753 --> 41:47.629
I guess you better prove it.

41:51.384 --> 41:52.968
I'm going to.
