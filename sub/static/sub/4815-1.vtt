WEBVTT

03:14.279 --> 03:18.325
They've found another one.
There'll be no treasure left for her.

03:18.533 --> 03:20.410
Mark the location.

03:20.660 --> 03:25.165
That's the Frenchman.
And over there, Kristos.

03:25.374 --> 03:28.710
They're all coming. All except one.

03:28.960 --> 03:31.338
All right, follow Kristos.

03:31.546 --> 03:33.674
When he dives, we dive.

03:33.882 --> 03:38.804
Maybe we'll get lucky
and find whatever's down there.

03:39.888 --> 03:45.185
Look at that, Jimmy. Look!
Why isn't she slowing down?

03:48.397 --> 03:51.525
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

03:51.733 --> 03:55.153
- You were asking?
- I knew it!

04:13.130 --> 04:15.841
Hello, boys. You're all wet.

04:17.801 --> 04:20.887
Many raiders are here,
and you make us wait!

04:21.096 --> 04:24.683
But you know I can't resist a bit of fun.

04:27.102 --> 04:31.606
What's all this fuss about?
What do they think is down there?

04:31.815 --> 04:36.945
I don't know what they think,
but I think it's the Luna Temple.

04:37.195 --> 04:38.989
The Luna Temple?

04:39.239 --> 04:42.117
My sons! If it's not on television, forget it!

04:42.325 --> 04:46.121
- It was built by Alexander the Great.
- A Greek, if you don't know!

04:46.371 --> 04:50.584
Alexander collected treasures
and stored them in two places.

04:50.792 --> 04:54.087
The majority went to his library in Egypt.

04:54.338 --> 05:00.010
But his most prized possessions
went here... the Luna Temple.

05:00.218 --> 05:04.473
By law, no one was allowed to record
its location, and in 330 BC it was...

05:04.723 --> 05:09.144
...swallowed by the sea.
- Destroyed during a volcanic eruption.

05:09.353 --> 05:11.855
Lost for ever.

05:12.064 --> 05:13.440
Until yesterday.

05:15.233 --> 05:20.113
If even half of it is intact, it will be
the greatest find since the Pyramids.

05:20.322 --> 05:23.200
The others are heading along this shelf.

05:23.408 --> 05:26.036
- That's based on the currents?
- Yes.

05:26.244 --> 05:29.414
This, Gus, is why I was late.

05:29.623 --> 05:32.793
It's a geological,
taken two hours after the quake.

05:33.043 --> 05:37.464
The epicentre was here,
five miles northeast of us, but...

05:37.673 --> 05:41.718
...look at the currents
along the shelf now.

05:41.927 --> 05:43.887
Wait! They've shifted.

05:44.096 --> 05:48.725
So, while they're all diving there,
the ruins will actually be...

05:51.019 --> 05:53.230
...here.

05:53.480 --> 05:55.440
Let's go.

06:17.087 --> 06:19.631
Something wrong?

06:19.881 --> 06:23.343
First, Alexander doesn't record
the temple's location.

06:23.552 --> 06:26.680
Then, God wipes it from the earth
with a volcano.

06:26.888 --> 06:29.641
Now, even the currents change.

06:29.850 --> 06:33.979
Lara, maybe this temple's
not meant to be found.

06:34.855 --> 06:40.694
Everything lost is meant to be found.
Don't worry.

08:44.735 --> 08:47.195
It's incredible!

08:47.946 --> 08:50.323
It's unbelievable! Whoa!

08:50.532 --> 08:53.994
- Oh, my God.
- This is huge!

08:54.202 --> 08:55.579
Thank you.

09:01.209 --> 09:02.669
Wonderful.

09:04.254 --> 09:06.715
Jimmy, this is wonderful!

09:08.383 --> 09:11.511
- Do you see what I see?
- Oh, my God!

09:11.720 --> 09:13.722
It's incredible.

09:13.930 --> 09:17.601
Nicky, look at this.
We're going to be rich!

09:22.230 --> 09:26.109
Lara! What do you say
to two handsome Greek partners?

09:26.360 --> 09:29.279
Well, when you find two, let me know!

09:29.488 --> 09:33.533
- She's talking about you.
- No, you!

09:34.743 --> 09:36.703
Pack the gold coins.

10:17.244 --> 10:20.998
- Lara, what is that?
- It's mine.

10:34.219 --> 10:36.221
What is she doing?

10:58.660 --> 11:01.580
Lara! That column is collapsing!

11:09.546 --> 11:11.673
Aftershock!

11:11.882 --> 11:15.260
- I think that's a sign to leave!
- Two minutes!

11:15.886 --> 11:20.766
- Lara, we need to leave now!
- We've got to move!

11:30.275 --> 11:34.446
Keep packing. This thing is going
to collapse. Take those two.

11:34.696 --> 11:38.992
- We have to hurry up.
- Go, go! Come on!

11:43.121 --> 11:44.623
Lara!

16:33.829 --> 16:38.125
Lara? Lara, it's us, Hillary and Bryce!

16:41.003 --> 16:44.506
She's disorientated.
That's normal after three days.

16:44.715 --> 16:47.676
Nice day for a dip.

16:48.677 --> 16:52.639
Gentlemen, there is an expression:

16:53.265 --> 16:57.436
"It's not nice to fool other Nature. "

16:57.644 --> 17:02.941
Yet that is precisely what I've been
doing for some time now...

17:04.608 --> 17:07.654
...whether it be sarin gas for Mr San,

17:07.863 --> 17:11.657
improved typhoid for Mr Krev
to use in the Balkans,

17:11.867 --> 17:15.619
enhanced cholera for Mr Duvalier.

17:15.829 --> 17:18.582
While these weapons
serve their purpose,

17:18.790 --> 17:21.877
there have always been limitations.

17:22.085 --> 17:25.047
Stable diseases aren't lethal.

17:26.173 --> 17:29.134
Deadly ones burn out too quickly.

17:29.343 --> 17:32.679
Mother Nature can only
be fooled so much.

17:33.722 --> 17:39.436
Deploy my weapon, and your enemies,
however great, will collapse from within.

17:44.900 --> 17:49.363
Rather like Mr Monza's
collapsing right now.

17:57.496 --> 18:02.292
- What the hell is going on?
- Monza told Ml6 about this meeting.

18:02.501 --> 18:05.045
That's why the change of location.

18:05.253 --> 18:11.802
He was going to turn me over to them
and then seek asylum in the West.

18:12.010 --> 18:14.888
A smart man would've known
I was on to him.

18:15.097 --> 18:19.393
He would never have got on the plane.
But I knew you would.

18:19.601 --> 18:22.354
You actually thought you could fool me.

18:27.442 --> 18:32.239
That, gentlemen, is the sound
of a traitor dying.

18:42.290 --> 18:47.087
That was an accelerated form of Ebola,
deadliest disease known to man.

18:47.295 --> 18:49.214
Highly contagious.

18:50.298 --> 18:54.970
However, as with all known diseases,

18:55.178 --> 18:58.473
there exist stockpiles of antiserum
in the West.

19:27.336 --> 19:31.173
There is no antiserum
for what I am offering you.

19:31.381 --> 19:34.176
No treatment. No vaccine. No cure.

19:34.384 --> 19:37.679
The world's never seen
anything like what I've uncovered.

19:37.888 --> 19:39.473
Uncovered?

19:39.681 --> 19:42.476
Yes. I've branched out.

19:42.684 --> 19:45.354
Archaeology.

19:45.562 --> 19:49.441
0-7-7-4-4-6-8-1.

19:49.649 --> 19:53.653
That is the account
at the Landesbank in Bern.

19:53.862 --> 19:57.699
$1 00 million each, if you please.

20:22.057 --> 20:26.353
- Where's Chen Lo?
- He has the orb, but Ml6 is on to him.

20:26.561 --> 20:28.021
- How?
- He doesn't know.

20:28.230 --> 20:31.233
Rather than risk bringing it, he's waiting.

20:31.441 --> 20:36.571
I have just told a cabin full of men about
Pandora. The clock cannot be reset.

20:36.780 --> 20:38.949
Tell him to bring the orb at once.

20:57.467 --> 21:02.097
You'll find the killers.
Don't take it out on me!

21:18.655 --> 21:23.702
- Bryce, what have we got?
- I haven't loaded your images yet.

21:27.831 --> 21:30.876
- What about references to an orb?
- I checked.

21:31.084 --> 21:34.171
Inventories of the Luna Temple
do not list any orb.

21:34.421 --> 21:38.842
I want you both to list every orb
ever mentioned in Greek history.

21:39.051 --> 21:40.761
Every one?

21:51.104 --> 21:53.732
That's... liable...

21:54.775 --> 21:56.818
...to be...

21:59.780 --> 22:01.490
...thousands.

22:03.659 --> 22:06.078
Then we'll read thousands.

22:08.580 --> 22:10.874
Start with that one.

23:05.178 --> 23:08.056
Perhaps you'd like some tea
while you wait?

23:08.265 --> 23:12.936
No, they wouldn't. Tea is for guests,
the door is for intruders!

23:14.938 --> 23:16.898
They're from Ml6.

23:17.065 --> 23:20.527
I can tell from their soft hands
and pressed suits.

23:20.736 --> 23:24.239
They make decisions
and leave the dirty work for others.

23:24.448 --> 23:28.035
- I've no interest in...
- His name's Chen Lo.

23:28.327 --> 23:32.914
Along with his brother Xien, he runs
a ring of bandits, the Shay Ling.

23:33.123 --> 23:37.252
They deal in guns, diamonds, antiquities
to sell on the black market.

23:37.419 --> 23:42.007
They followed you when you arrived
in Santorini, where they killed Gus.

23:42.215 --> 23:44.968
- Why?
- For this.

23:45.177 --> 23:48.680
Our listening post in Malta
intercepted that fax.

23:48.889 --> 23:52.351
It was sent from Chen Lo
to a man named Jonathan Reiss.

23:52.559 --> 23:54.728
The scientist? Won the Nobel Prize?

23:54.978 --> 23:59.316
He's now the foremost designer
of biological weapons in the world.

23:59.524 --> 24:03.862
His creations have been at the heart
of bio-terror in the past 1 5 years.

24:04.112 --> 24:10.452
Reiss's disdain for life is legendary.
He doesn't care who his weapons kill.

24:10.661 --> 24:13.288
A modern-day Doctor Mengele.

24:17.668 --> 24:21.922
We know Chen Lo followed you
to obtain the orb, and thus deliver Reiss.

24:22.130 --> 24:25.217
We don't know why.
Candidly, that terrifies us.

24:25.467 --> 24:28.679
Reiss is not to be trifled with.

24:28.887 --> 24:31.348
Pandora's box.

24:34.267 --> 24:38.480
Reiss is going to use the orb
to find Pandora's box.

24:38.689 --> 24:40.357
The Greek myth?

24:40.565 --> 24:45.070
Pandora opens a forbidden box
and unleashes pain into the world?

24:45.278 --> 24:48.949
That's the Sunday school version, yes.

24:49.157 --> 24:54.079
How do you think life began?
Shooting star? Primordial ooze?

24:54.287 --> 24:57.165
In 2300 BC, an Egyptian pharaoh

24:57.374 --> 25:02.713
found a place he named The Cradle
of Life, where we, life, began.

25:02.921 --> 25:06.091
There he found a box,
which brought life to Earth.

25:06.299 --> 25:10.429
The pharaoh opened it, but all that
was left was the Ramante, or anti-life.

25:10.637 --> 25:13.515
The plague, the companion to life.

25:13.724 --> 25:16.435
- Companion?
- Nature is about balance.

25:16.643 --> 25:21.440
All the world comes in pairs.
Yin and Yang, right and wrong.

25:21.648 --> 25:25.819
- What did this plague do?
- It levelled the pharaoh's army.

25:26.028 --> 25:31.658
A soldier was dispatched to transport
the box to the end of the world.

25:33.910 --> 25:37.956
2,000 years later,
Alexander the Great reached India,

25:38.165 --> 25:43.670
where his army was ravaged
by a plague after finding a box.

25:43.879 --> 25:47.382
India?
That's where the soldier brought it?

25:47.591 --> 25:50.385
Alexander felt the box
was too powerful,

25:50.594 --> 25:53.805
so he returned it to its home,
The Cradle of Life.

25:54.056 --> 25:56.183
It has never been seen since.

25:56.391 --> 26:00.270
- And this Cradle of Life is where?
- No one knows.

26:00.479 --> 26:05.150
Alexander used a map with the box,
which he then hid from the world.

26:05.359 --> 26:08.278
But the name he gave this map
was "Mati",

26:08.487 --> 26:13.825
and the literal translation
for the word "Mati" is eye.

26:14.034 --> 26:18.789
The orb is the map, hidden
in the Luna Temple by Alexander.

26:18.997 --> 26:22.834
Reiss will use it to find Pandora's box,
and when he opens it,

26:23.043 --> 26:28.173
he will unleash a weapon more
powerful than you could ever imagine.

26:31.343 --> 26:36.014
The markings form a pattern,
but even if I figure what they mean,

26:36.223 --> 26:41.103
we still can't read the whole map
because we've only a partial view.

26:41.311 --> 26:45.357
- We have to figure out how to read it.
- Right. Thank you.

26:45.565 --> 26:50.237
On behalf of Her Majesty,
recover this box before Doctor Reiss.

26:50.445 --> 26:55.701
Oh...! Well, now that I have
Her Majesty's permission...

26:55.909 --> 27:00.956
- Tell me where to find the orb.
- It's in China with Chen Lo.

27:01.164 --> 27:04.459
We'll assign two of our best agents
to help.

27:04.668 --> 27:06.712
I don't want them.

27:06.920 --> 27:11.425
- Expertise in archaeology doesn't...
- I didn't say that I don't need help.

27:11.633 --> 27:17.973
But you won't get me there in time.
I need someone inside the Shay Ling.

27:18.181 --> 27:21.143
Their methods, their hideouts.

27:23.437 --> 27:28.984
- I need Terry Sheridan.
- Not if he were the last man on Earth!

27:29.192 --> 27:32.404
Terry Sheridan, ex-commander
with the Royal Marines,

27:32.612 --> 27:34.990
turned mercenary and traitor.

27:35.699 --> 27:41.580
Put that man on the trail of a weapon
he can sell to the highest bidder?

27:57.304 --> 27:59.097
Open!

28:00.307 --> 28:02.434
I am your host, Armin Kal.

28:02.642 --> 28:05.145
Welcome to Fantasy Island.

28:57.030 --> 28:58.740
Croft.

28:58.949 --> 29:00.617
Hello, Terry.

29:08.709 --> 29:11.795
What do you think of my new place?

29:12.004 --> 29:14.464
It's not quite Croft Manor.

29:16.091 --> 29:18.468
What? A key to your heart?

29:18.719 --> 29:24.224
To a flat in Zurich.
You can pick another city, if you want.

29:24.433 --> 29:26.935
Your record expunged,
your citizenship restored.

29:27.144 --> 29:29.354
- By?
- Ml6.

29:29.563 --> 29:31.523
Ml6...

29:31.732 --> 29:34.985
Would that make me Faust,
or the Devil?

29:35.193 --> 29:39.072
Pick one, because Ml6 will also
arrange a new identity.

29:39.281 --> 29:45.662
- Yeah? You think I need their help?
- Having two faces doesn't count.

29:45.871 --> 29:47.914
What do I have to do?

29:48.123 --> 29:51.418
- Take me to the Shay Ling.
- The Shay who?

29:51.626 --> 29:55.422
Chen Lo took something from me
and I want it back.

29:55.630 --> 29:57.883
Is that you or Ml6?

29:58.091 --> 30:01.887
Also, I've arranged for Â£5 million
when we succeed.

30:02.095 --> 30:05.891
- Call it "second chance" money.
- Or life insurance for you.

30:06.099 --> 30:08.810
I don't need any.

30:11.646 --> 30:13.482
You and I, working alone?

30:13.732 --> 30:17.486
It's easier to see through you that way.

30:17.736 --> 30:19.404
So what if, afterwards,

30:19.613 --> 30:23.950
Ml6 decide that me back in the world
isn't such a great idea?

30:24.159 --> 30:28.580
Then I feel sorry for whomever
they get to come after you.

30:33.043 --> 30:37.547
- You've authorisation to kill me?
- Any time, for any reason.

30:37.756 --> 30:40.759
Why don't you just do it, then?

30:40.967 --> 30:44.179
What is it they say? "Hell hath no fury..."

30:44.388 --> 30:46.473
You're not that good.

30:46.682 --> 30:49.851
The Shay Ling are like ghosts, Croft.

30:50.686 --> 30:52.312
They move constantly,

30:52.521 --> 30:56.191
and their home is the most remote
mountain region in China.

30:56.441 --> 30:58.235
Region?

30:58.485 --> 31:01.321
You'll have to do better than that.

31:12.749 --> 31:16.837
Get me into China,
and I'll get you to them in a day.

31:17.045 --> 31:20.966
No guns, no money,
no weapons of any kind.

31:21.174 --> 31:24.052
Talk about taking the fun out of life!

31:40.694 --> 31:42.612
They've spies all over China.

31:42.821 --> 31:46.825
We slip in to Beijing undetected,
then we go by truck.

31:47.034 --> 31:51.913
Truck? I was thinking
about something a little faster.

31:57.878 --> 31:59.671
A little faster?

32:02.966 --> 32:07.721
This is a little faster,
but the Chinese will track the pod.

32:09.222 --> 32:14.811
- There won't be any pod to find.
- Will there be any of us to find?

32:20.192 --> 32:23.654
- Ready? Now.
- Ready for what?

32:41.421 --> 32:45.717
The ditching was good, Croft.
I'll give you that.

32:45.926 --> 32:50.889
But we'll never find a vehicle
in a place like this.

32:56.561 --> 32:59.398
Oh, it's so lovely to see you.

33:01.733 --> 33:03.443
- Is everything ready?
- Yes.

33:03.694 --> 33:08.407
Your clothes, guns and knives
are over there.

33:08.615 --> 33:12.077
And I took the liberty of tuning your bike.

33:12.285 --> 33:14.287
- May I?
- Yes.

33:31.805 --> 33:33.265
- Lara.
- Ah!

33:33.473 --> 33:37.602
- What is the happy couple up to?
- Accessorising.

33:37.811 --> 33:42.232
- Where are we on reading the orb?
- All maps have a key, a legend.

33:42.482 --> 33:45.527
The orb's key's not there,
it must've been lost.

33:45.736 --> 33:48.447
Or somewhere in the temple.

33:48.655 --> 33:52.117
Go through every image I took
near the orb.

33:52.326 --> 33:57.456
The key must've been linked to it
in some way. Right, bye, then.

33:57.664 --> 34:02.169
It's unlike Lara to take a partner.
Where are you two going?

34:02.377 --> 34:08.216
We'll take a nice little trip,
breathe some fresh mountain air,

34:08.425 --> 34:10.677
stop by my friends, the Shay Ling.

34:24.399 --> 34:28.235
The Shay Ling watch all the roads,
we'll go round the back.

34:28.445 --> 34:31.782
- We'll go straight.
- Maybe you didn't hear me.

34:31.989 --> 34:36.078
The Shay Ling have men
on every road from here to Luoyang.

34:36.244 --> 34:38.914
Not every road.

35:11.321 --> 35:14.741
- A bit rusty?
- It's coming back.

35:14.950 --> 35:16.910
I expected more from a Scot.

35:17.160 --> 35:20.539
I don't expect anything
from an Englishwoman!

35:20.747 --> 35:23.750
Good, 'cause you're
not gonna get anything.

36:02.372 --> 36:06.960
The fun's over.
From now on, it's by foot.

36:09.796 --> 36:13.717
- Best to reconsider that "no gun" rule.
- No.

36:15.594 --> 36:17.220
OK.

36:24.978 --> 36:27.606
And don't be looking at my ass.

36:28.732 --> 36:31.652
- Where do I fit in?
- You're the guide.

36:31.860 --> 36:33.320
I mean,

36:33.528 --> 36:37.741
when you think back on the vast
scheme of your adventurous life,

36:37.949 --> 36:40.118
where do I fit in?

36:40.327 --> 36:44.373
Was I the love of your life
or just another bump on the road?

36:44.623 --> 36:50.504
Was I time well spent?
Four months, more good than bad?

36:50.754 --> 36:55.258
Come on, it had to be more
than that, am I right?

36:55.467 --> 36:57.552
You're right.

36:57.761 --> 37:00.389
It was five months.

37:02.015 --> 37:06.937
- You're laughing at me.
- Because I used to find you charming.

37:08.689 --> 37:11.108
I am charming.

37:37.009 --> 37:38.969
You're late!

37:44.391 --> 37:47.602
Tilt your head back. Do it!

37:51.106 --> 37:54.860
You might see again in an hour. Maybe.

38:05.245 --> 38:10.751
What's this? It's not there.
There's no orb.

38:12.210 --> 38:16.131
Is there anything
you can tell me about this?

38:30.520 --> 38:33.482
- Hello?
- You didn't like your messenger?

38:33.732 --> 38:37.027
I didn't. But I liked the men
I lost in the temple.

38:37.235 --> 38:39.821
You underestimated Lady Croft.

38:40.030 --> 38:44.242
I underestimated
how much this orb is worth.

38:44.451 --> 38:47.329
There's so many
horrible diseases in the world.

38:47.537 --> 38:50.624
Things we are particularly
susceptible to as children.

38:50.832 --> 38:54.711
You could be holding
little Shiho or Tai by the hand,

38:54.961 --> 38:58.256
as a mysterious ailment
ravages their bodies.

38:59.132 --> 39:03.303
You kill them, and I will give
your orb to Lady Croft.

39:03.512 --> 39:07.057
She's a few miles away
from here as we speak.

39:07.307 --> 39:09.768
I wonder how much she would pay.

39:10.602 --> 39:13.188
I'll pay you an additional $1 2 million.

39:13.438 --> 39:18.610
It will be yours once you've delivered
the orb along with Lady Croft's body.

39:18.819 --> 39:22.656
- You don't know where they are.
- You're impossible.

39:22.864 --> 39:26.284
You pretended to know
so I'd get you out.

39:26.451 --> 39:30.288
This isn't a tomb, Croft,
and the Shay Ling aren't mummies.

39:30.497 --> 39:33.917
They're killers.
But if you don't trust me...

39:38.588 --> 39:44.052
I'm sorry to have to do this,
but you're wasting time.

39:46.179 --> 39:49.057
You want to shoot me? Shoot me.

39:49.266 --> 39:51.727
Personally, I'd rather you do it...

39:51.977 --> 39:54.021
...than them.

40:12.080 --> 40:13.707
Well, Terry,

40:13.915 --> 40:19.338
what part of "never come back again"
didn't you understand?

40:21.256 --> 40:23.633
You wanted to find the Shay Ling.

40:25.177 --> 40:26.470
Come on!

40:26.720 --> 40:30.390
The only way to get into their place
is as their prisoners.

40:30.599 --> 40:34.561
- You might've told me that before.
- You would've believed me?

40:34.770 --> 40:38.732
Make Chen Lo a better offer
than his buyer. He'll cross them.

40:38.982 --> 40:42.235
Even if his buyer's Jonathan Reiss?

40:42.444 --> 40:45.197
You might've told me that before!

41:29.574 --> 41:34.454
- Were you really gonna kill me?
- I bet she would have.

41:34.663 --> 41:38.333
I've seen her in action.
Didn't Terry tell you?

41:38.542 --> 41:42.754
The last time any of us saw him,
he was riding away with a truck...

41:43.380 --> 41:46.091
...full of my Ming vases.

41:46.299 --> 41:48.760
And sitting next to him...

41:50.429 --> 41:52.889
...was his sister.

41:54.182 --> 41:55.684
How is she?

41:55.892 --> 41:59.021
You... shouldn't have come here.

42:00.689 --> 42:05.152
It got me out of prison.
Besides, the lady has a good offer.

42:05.360 --> 42:08.280
- Better than Reiss.
- Really?

42:08.530 --> 42:11.616
- Should I take it?
- Take it.

42:11.825 --> 42:18.123
Or you and I ransom her and the thing
back to the British for triple.

42:19.166 --> 42:21.126
Let's talk.

42:21.335 --> 42:23.587
Not you, Terry.

42:23.837 --> 42:26.214
Lady Croft and I.

42:26.423 --> 42:30.177
You wait here. Catch up.

42:30.761 --> 42:33.930
I'll be four minutes.

42:34.139 --> 42:36.099
Terrific.

42:38.643 --> 42:42.939
There is something
I think you will appreciate.

42:51.239 --> 42:55.952
This is the largest group
of terracotta warriors I have found.

42:56.161 --> 43:00.165
The King of Chin made them
for use in the afterlife.

43:00.374 --> 43:04.294
To fend off enemies
he made in this one.

43:04.544 --> 43:07.839
Sounds like we could both use a set.

43:08.048 --> 43:10.717
I will be happy to sell some to you.

43:10.926 --> 43:13.887
I hope you're as entrepreneurial
with the orb.

43:14.096 --> 43:19.851
You lost men, I lost men. I see
no reason we should both lose again.

43:20.060 --> 43:22.521
If I want double
what Reiss offered me...

43:22.688 --> 43:25.524
- Is it here?
- It's worth a lot.

43:25.732 --> 43:30.028
Then you know Reiss will kill you
the moment you give it to him.

43:30.237 --> 43:33.448
- Your government assures my safety?
- No.

43:33.657 --> 43:36.201
But I will.

43:36.410 --> 43:39.371
That must hurt, saying that to me.

43:40.539 --> 43:43.417
Take the offer.

43:50.674 --> 43:56.179
- You presume to give me orders?
- Take the offer before it expires.

43:56.430 --> 43:57.764
No.

43:57.973 --> 44:03.687
- Then I will have to force you.
- Then I will have to kill you!

45:13.006 --> 45:15.467
Has it been four minutes yet?

45:58.885 --> 46:00.762
That was nice.

46:02.347 --> 46:05.600
It's too bad you're on the wrong side.

46:06.852 --> 46:11.982
Tell me where the orb is
and it spares your life.

46:13.400 --> 46:16.194
The Flower Pagoda, in Shanghai.

46:16.403 --> 46:18.363
9 p.m.

46:20.449 --> 46:22.117
This is mine.

46:32.044 --> 46:34.004
Now, we're even.

46:47.642 --> 46:49.353
Now!

47:07.287 --> 47:10.624
Remember that "no gun" rule?
I reconsidered.

47:42.823 --> 47:47.035
You know there was a staircase
we could've used?

48:12.519 --> 48:15.314
- Lara, are you all right?
- Smashing.

48:15.522 --> 48:20.360
I'm on my way to Shanghai,
and I need you to look at something.

48:20.569 --> 48:26.325
It was in the Luna Temple.
I'm betting it's the key to the markings.

48:26.533 --> 48:29.494
She's holding some sort
of musical instrument.

48:31.371 --> 48:33.749
It's sound.

48:33.957 --> 48:37.669
- That's brilliant.
- The key must be linked to it.

48:37.878 --> 48:40.964
I'll start decoding the images.
Get the rest. Bye.

48:41.173 --> 48:43.508
- Miss you.
- Bye!

49:52.953 --> 49:54.871
Oh, well.

49:55.080 --> 49:57.749
Just like old times.

50:01.920 --> 50:06.925
I think that's the first time
you've actually smiled because of me.

50:13.640 --> 50:15.892
Why did you do it?

50:16.101 --> 50:20.856
I started thinking I was tired of doing
things somebody else's way.

50:21.064 --> 50:23.317
It'd always be somebody else's way.

50:23.525 --> 50:27.362
So you abandon your men
and betray your country?

50:27.571 --> 50:32.993
Leaving my men and my country,
that didn't hurt as much as I thought.

50:33.827 --> 50:36.330
But leaving you did.

50:39.082 --> 50:43.045
You're a hard act to follow, Croft.

50:46.381 --> 50:49.885
You know why you and I
get along so well?

50:50.093 --> 50:51.636
No.

50:53.263 --> 50:56.683
We are two of a kind, me and you.

50:59.144 --> 51:03.857
- We are nothing alike.
- I don't think we're alike.

51:04.066 --> 51:08.987
But I do think we're a pair.
Opposite sides of the same coin.

51:33.387 --> 51:38.183
- My men have the roof covered.
- Set down in the square instead.

51:38.392 --> 51:41.228
My men will also have things covered.

51:41.436 --> 51:43.438
OK, fine.

51:43.647 --> 51:45.524
OK, Sean, let's go!

51:50.112 --> 51:52.406
They're landing in the square.

51:53.615 --> 51:56.702
- We're in the wrong position. Stairs?
- No time.

51:56.910 --> 51:58.245
- Rooftops?
- No.

51:58.453 --> 52:03.458
I've got a plan.
Stay here. Wait for my signal.

52:07.004 --> 52:09.965
Here's the money, come and get it!

52:17.597 --> 52:19.057
Wait for my signal, huh?

52:19.266 --> 52:22.227
- Give me that box!
- Money first!

52:22.394 --> 52:27.232
- Give me that box now!
- No! You first!

52:35.782 --> 52:38.410
Christ! Get us out of here!

52:39.244 --> 52:41.455
Take us up!

53:05.395 --> 53:06.730
Take it up!

53:20.786 --> 53:23.121
Go! Run her over!

53:37.886 --> 53:41.556
- Yeah?
- We tried it your way. Now we try mine.

53:41.765 --> 53:45.018
- Bring it to the top of the pagoda now!
- OK.

54:24.391 --> 54:25.767
Got you!

54:35.986 --> 54:38.405
Come on! Hold it up!

54:46.163 --> 54:50.542
- Come closer!
- Raise it higher! Higher!

54:54.588 --> 54:59.176
- My regards to your brother!
- Too late.

55:00.093 --> 55:02.387
Croft, what are you doing?

55:13.357 --> 55:14.775
Take us up!

55:19.029 --> 55:20.781
Move! Go!

55:27.579 --> 55:30.290
Let's go! Move!

55:42.803 --> 55:46.348
I'm tired of you pointing that at me.
You OK?

55:46.556 --> 55:51.311
- Never better.
- Looks like we lost the orb.

55:51.895 --> 55:54.940
I wouldn't go vaulting
into thin air for nothing.

55:55.148 --> 55:57.776
I've put a tracer on the crate.

56:00.153 --> 56:02.197
Got it. Look.

56:06.994 --> 56:08.036
Impressive.

56:36.606 --> 56:40.902
A weapons lab
in the middle of the city? No way.

56:41.153 --> 56:43.405
He must've dumped that crate.

56:43.613 --> 56:45.991
No, it's here.

56:46.199 --> 56:48.660
One of the buildings?

56:48.869 --> 56:53.582
No.
It's exactly where we're standing.

56:59.421 --> 57:04.509
Part of me allowed for the possibility
that Pandora's box was just a legend.

57:05.510 --> 57:08.347
But now I know it's there.

57:13.477 --> 57:17.189
- She escaped.
- She has no idea where we are.

57:17.397 --> 57:19.232
We take no chances.

57:19.441 --> 57:23.654
Have everything we need to make
an antidote transferred to the jet.

57:27.658 --> 57:31.912
I need an out for two people.
Mid-city. Soon.

57:34.206 --> 57:37.167
What? Are you crazy?

57:38.251 --> 57:41.713
- Are we set?
- Piece of cake.

58:54.995 --> 58:56.747
Hello.

59:46.672 --> 59:50.050
- So much for easy.
- What is that?

59:53.387 --> 59:55.472
He's already decoding the orb.

59:56.390 --> 59:58.016
Bugger!

01:00:00.519 --> 01:00:02.479
Headset.

01:00:24.418 --> 01:00:26.878
You've gotta get everyone out.

01:00:27.129 --> 01:00:30.007
What do you suggest, the fire alarm?

01:00:36.471 --> 01:00:39.391
Not bad. But that's just the alarm.

01:00:40.309 --> 01:00:41.893
There's no danger.

01:00:42.102 --> 01:00:46.898
Do you think anyone here is paid
enough to take that chance?

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:56.241
Don't even think about it.

01:00:57.326 --> 01:00:59.286
It's her.

01:01:02.247 --> 01:01:03.874
Yes?

01:01:07.169 --> 01:01:08.712
Damn!

01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:20.409
I'm glad, Lara!
That would've been too easy!

01:02:25.247 --> 01:02:27.958
Give me your best!

01:02:44.516 --> 01:02:45.851
How's that?

01:02:47.602 --> 01:02:51.273
- I'm going off-line.
- No, don't!

01:02:54.484 --> 01:02:56.278
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:02.701
Hello, boys.
Did you understand the medallion?

01:03:02.868 --> 01:03:05.579
Yeah. The markings are sound waves.

01:03:05.787 --> 01:03:09.374
We've translated all the markings,
roughly half the orb.

01:03:09.583 --> 01:03:13.754
Let's complete the set, then.
I'll send the rest of them to you.

01:03:13.962 --> 01:03:18.717
Then finish the translation
and transmit the sounds back to me.

01:03:30.270 --> 01:03:33.231
We need more back-up.

01:03:48.121 --> 01:03:50.082
Smart girl.

01:04:14.481 --> 01:04:16.024
Move!

01:04:16.274 --> 01:04:21.238
Don't shoot her! Not until we're sure
the computer has done its job.

01:04:21.488 --> 01:04:26.118
You honestly believe you'll be able
to control what's in that box?

01:04:26.326 --> 01:04:28.578
Really, Lara, you disappoint me.

01:04:28.787 --> 01:04:31.999
Have we received payment
from all the buyers?

01:04:33.375 --> 01:04:39.381
No, you don't want to control it at all.
You're using the buyers.

01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:44.052
They'll release it as just another
weapon, and the world blames them.

01:04:44.261 --> 01:04:47.472
What's left of the world blames them.

01:04:49.016 --> 01:04:52.102
Once I have the virus,
I'll make enough antidote

01:04:52.311 --> 01:04:54.771
to protect the best and the brightest.

01:04:55.022 --> 01:04:58.942
Heads of corporations,
heads of state. Life will go on.

01:04:59.192 --> 01:05:00.986
You've never thought,

01:05:01.236 --> 01:05:04.323
"The world would be better
without certain people"?

01:05:04.531 --> 01:05:08.827
I can certainly think of one person
I could do without.

01:05:14.708 --> 01:05:16.626
There it is.

01:05:16.835 --> 01:05:20.922
I'm sorry, Lara. You'd have been
welcome in my world.

01:05:21.131 --> 01:05:22.716
Piss off.

01:05:22.924 --> 01:05:26.261
Shoot her between the eyes.
No mistakes.

01:06:08.595 --> 01:06:10.055
Asshole!

01:06:11.014 --> 01:06:13.558
I'm gonna get you.

01:06:13.767 --> 01:06:15.727
Follow me!

01:06:33.453 --> 01:06:35.330
You're mine.

01:07:24.629 --> 01:07:28.884
Bingo! Two one-way tickets
out of Hong Kong.

01:07:31.261 --> 01:07:33.221
Parachutes!

01:07:34.014 --> 01:07:36.975
Something a little faster.

01:07:38.644 --> 01:07:40.771
Come on!

01:07:44.358 --> 01:07:48.070
Our rendezvous point is two
and a half, maybe three miles.

01:07:48.278 --> 01:07:52.282
You're aware that no one's ever gone
further than one mile?

01:07:52.491 --> 01:07:54.993
- I am now.
- This way!

01:07:55.243 --> 01:07:58.747
- Right, you go first.
- No, you go first.

01:08:02.167 --> 01:08:04.044
I'll go first!

01:08:14.513 --> 01:08:16.098
Holy cow!

01:08:17.432 --> 01:08:19.393
Follow her.

01:09:39.930 --> 01:09:43.268
Hi, Terry. Good to see you.

01:10:01.328 --> 01:10:05.123
I suppose you want paying, then?
We agreed on $200?

01:10:05.332 --> 01:10:08.126
No, $300! Expenses.

01:11:05.726 --> 01:11:07.936
So this...

01:11:10.314 --> 01:11:13.025
...rock is the map?

01:11:13.233 --> 01:11:14.901
Yes, it is.

01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:18.697
I've never seen anything like it.
Have you?

01:11:19.531 --> 01:11:22.701
And it's the only way to find that box?

01:11:22.951 --> 01:11:26.538
Just think, you could take it
and walk out the door.

01:11:26.747 --> 01:11:32.377
No. Window's better,
off the ship faster, harder to track.

01:11:34.254 --> 01:11:39.217
Croft, do you really think
I would do that to you?

01:12:16.630 --> 01:12:21.593
You can break my wrist,
but I'm still gonna kiss you.

01:13:30.245 --> 01:13:34.666
Not exactly what I had in mind, but OK.

01:13:34.875 --> 01:13:38.086
- Why didn't you shoot Reiss?
- What?

01:13:38.295 --> 01:13:42.966
He must have walked
right past you in the lab.

01:13:43.175 --> 01:13:45.135
Why didn't you shoot him?

01:13:45.344 --> 01:13:48.639
I didn't have a clear shot,
and I had no idea where you were.

01:13:48.847 --> 01:13:51.767
I'll inform Ml6 of the completion
of your service.

01:13:51.975 --> 01:13:55.395
You'll have your money and your life.

01:13:55.604 --> 01:13:59.816
- Don't waste it.
- This is no time to split up.

01:14:00.025 --> 01:14:04.655
Yes, it is, before you make
the wrong decision.

01:14:08.367 --> 01:14:11.161
OK, you want to leave? Go ahead.

01:14:11.370 --> 01:14:15.082
But don't pretend
it's to try and save me.

01:14:15.290 --> 01:14:17.959
You're afraid
you might not pull the trigger.

01:14:18.168 --> 01:14:22.839
Afraid of letting your guard down,
of letting anyone in.

01:14:27.386 --> 01:14:30.055
I'm not leaving
because I couldn't kill you.

01:14:30.222 --> 01:14:33.809
I'm leaving because I could.

01:15:19.855 --> 01:15:21.523
Good morning.

01:15:21.732 --> 01:15:24.901
Might I borrow your television?

01:15:25.110 --> 01:15:27.446
It's important.

01:15:28.405 --> 01:15:30.407
Cheers. Lovely.

01:16:36.556 --> 01:16:39.685
- Hello, Bryce.
- Hello, Lara.

01:16:39.893 --> 01:16:42.437
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

01:16:42.688 --> 01:16:48.026
Right. Sending the last images
of the orb... now.

01:16:52.948 --> 01:16:54.950
Got them.

01:16:58.412 --> 01:17:01.623
Translating... Done.

01:17:05.127 --> 01:17:07.796
Send the sounds.

01:17:08.005 --> 01:17:10.424
Sending it now.

01:17:20.017 --> 01:17:21.977
No, nothing.

01:17:23.312 --> 01:17:26.273
Oh, well, back to the drawing board.

01:17:27.190 --> 01:17:31.570
No, wait. The tones are being distorted.
Send me the file.

01:17:31.778 --> 01:17:35.282
Look, Lara, I...
I really don't think that's gonna work.

01:17:35.490 --> 01:17:40.579
Yes, it will. Ever heard your voice
on a tape recorder? Same thing.

01:17:41.705 --> 01:17:46.918
Why are we having this discussion?
Send me the file.

01:17:47.127 --> 01:17:50.088
- Sending it.
- Thank you.

01:18:58.073 --> 01:18:59.658
Lara!

01:19:01.368 --> 01:19:03.704
Lara!

01:19:03.912 --> 01:19:06.123
Africa. It's in Africa.

01:19:06.373 --> 01:19:10.168
- Somewhere near Kilimanjaro.
- Great, Lara.

01:19:10.419 --> 01:19:12.879
How long for Reiss
to fix his computers?

01:19:13.088 --> 01:19:15.132
Twenty-four hours at the fastest.

01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:18.677
Ask Kosa to meet me
north of his village.

01:19:18.885 --> 01:19:22.014
0800 hours. Bye, then.

01:19:24.850 --> 01:19:28.854
A bit faster than
twenty-four hours, I'd say. Out!

01:19:33.817 --> 01:19:35.193
Africa it is.

01:19:53.712 --> 01:19:57.507
- Kosa? How are you?
- Lara?

01:19:57.716 --> 01:20:02.012
- You had the jeep cleaned.
- I know how you like your equipment!

01:20:02.262 --> 01:20:06.183
- Where are you? I can't see you.
- Don't worry, I can see you.

01:20:06.433 --> 01:20:09.061
Where are you coming from now?

01:20:09.269 --> 01:20:12.564
Keep going straight,
keep your speed steady.

01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:18.904
Lara! Welcome back!

01:20:24.576 --> 01:20:27.329
Do you ever do anything the easy way?

01:20:27.537 --> 01:20:30.123
And risk disappointing you?

01:20:36.838 --> 01:20:40.968
I've lost my friend and
I'm not sure where to go...

01:20:44.346 --> 01:20:46.056
Nice shirt.

01:20:46.765 --> 01:20:50.018
She went to Kilimanjaro
to play with the elephants.

01:21:05.492 --> 01:21:08.912
Kosa, we've never been here, have we?

01:21:09.121 --> 01:21:11.957
We didn't come
to this area before. Why?

01:21:12.165 --> 01:21:16.461
I've seen that mountain before.
The box is there somewhere.

01:21:16.670 --> 01:21:19.172
The locals call it
"The Mountain of God".

01:21:19.381 --> 01:21:24.219
There's a tribe that makes
a home on it that might help us.

01:22:07.679 --> 01:22:10.223
Leave this object and go.

01:22:10.515 --> 01:22:14.061
Leave this object and go.
And never speak of it.

01:22:14.269 --> 01:22:20.525
To trespass on The Cradle of Life is
to risk flooding the world with death.

01:22:20.776 --> 01:22:23.070
Men are coming for the box.

01:22:23.278 --> 01:22:26.865
Unlike me, they won't look at it
with fear or respect.

01:22:27.074 --> 01:22:29.618
They will open it. They want to use it.

01:22:29.868 --> 01:22:35.248
I'm sorry if I have to disturb your gods
to keep this from happening.

01:22:35.457 --> 01:22:38.877
But I will do whatever I must.

01:22:50.097 --> 01:22:54.142
Do you truly understand
what you are doing?

01:22:54.393 --> 01:23:00.232
Are you truly prepared
for what you are about to learn?

01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:03.235
Some secrets must remain secrets.

01:23:04.069 --> 01:23:08.490
These are very heavy burdens,
very lonely burdens.

01:23:11.743 --> 01:23:15.080
If you find the box,
you will have to carry them.

01:23:15.288 --> 01:23:17.624
I am prepared, sir.

01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:25.799
He warns that no one who has looked
for the box has come back.

01:23:26.049 --> 01:23:29.970
He says the land beyond the canyon
belongs to the Shadow Guardians.

01:23:30.178 --> 01:23:32.097
Shadow Guardians?

01:23:34.141 --> 01:23:36.893
They do not sleep.

01:23:37.102 --> 01:23:41.565
They never rest.
They move like the wind.

01:23:43.734 --> 01:23:47.779
And anything
that walks their land will die.

01:23:47.988 --> 01:23:50.365
And the Cradle itself?

01:23:52.284 --> 01:23:54.619
Only with the orb can it be revealed.

01:23:54.828 --> 01:23:58.957
Inside you will find a place of madness.
Sky and Earth are one.

01:23:59.166 --> 01:24:01.960
Direction, meaningless.

01:24:06.923 --> 01:24:11.011
He's going to give us twenty men
to take us as far as they can,

01:24:11.219 --> 01:24:15.682
to The Cradle of Life
where the box is hidden.

01:24:19.895 --> 01:24:22.022
We're getting closer.

01:24:26.902 --> 01:24:31.948
He said you're right.
The Cradle of Life lies near the summit.

01:24:32.824 --> 01:24:35.827
- He wants to know how you knew.
- The orb.

01:24:41.875 --> 01:24:47.506
He says he will not turn back with
the others. He'll go as far as we go.

01:24:47.714 --> 01:24:53.178
- He will fight the Shadow Guardians.
- You're a very brave man.

01:24:54.846 --> 01:24:56.890
What is he saying?

01:24:57.099 --> 01:25:00.060
That your accent is funny.

01:25:33.218 --> 01:25:34.553
Get down!

01:25:36.888 --> 01:25:39.016
Get down!

01:25:41.393 --> 01:25:44.062
Back! Back!

01:25:54.823 --> 01:25:56.533
Back! Get back!

01:26:15.010 --> 01:26:19.931
Thank you, Lara, for leading us here
and for finding the orb.

01:26:20.182 --> 01:26:22.851
However, you have seen
the exact position.

01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:25.437
You could save me hours, days even.

01:26:25.646 --> 01:26:29.316
Help me, I'll make it worth your while.

01:26:30.776 --> 01:26:32.069
No.

01:26:32.319 --> 01:26:36.281
Think of what I'm offering you.
Let her go.

01:26:37.074 --> 01:26:40.035
A chance to find out how it all began.

01:26:40.243 --> 01:26:43.705
Life, Lara, the origin of what we are.

01:26:43.914 --> 01:26:46.875
Don't tell me you're not tempted.

01:26:47.876 --> 01:26:53.090
- That's what got Pandora into trouble.
- They told me you wouldn't do it.

01:26:53.298 --> 01:26:59.262
And I told them you would, rather than
lose two of your closest friends.

01:27:00.555 --> 01:27:04.851
- Take us to The Cradle of Life.
- I'm sorry, Lara.

01:27:05.060 --> 01:27:09.022
It's your destiny to see what's inside.

01:27:09.231 --> 01:27:13.568
He is right. It's just beyond
the canyon, remember?

01:27:13.777 --> 01:27:17.698
Such a short walk
might save your friends.

01:27:20.325 --> 01:27:25.497
Well, if it spares my friends...
I'm up for a walk.

01:28:00.949 --> 01:28:02.951
I'm sure she'd understand.

01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:08.332
You should've told her we were hostage.
He'd never have found her.

01:28:22.262 --> 01:28:26.558
I don't suppose either of you
know how to fly a helicopter?

01:28:26.767 --> 01:28:28.602
I can.

01:28:28.810 --> 01:28:30.979
- What?
- What?

01:28:31.188 --> 01:28:36.568
I've got over 1 50 hours between
flight simulation games, models...

01:28:38.236 --> 01:28:40.822
And in the real thing?

01:28:41.031 --> 01:28:43.659
- Two.
- Two?

01:28:43.867 --> 01:28:50.165
You're only gonna fly it once I'm out,
so remember your two hours well!

01:29:23.323 --> 01:29:26.243
It's through here?

01:29:28.286 --> 01:29:30.163
Move, baby.

01:30:58.752 --> 01:31:00.712
What was that?

01:31:01.588 --> 01:31:04.216
You! Check it out!

01:31:07.469 --> 01:31:08.887
Keep moving!

01:31:54.141 --> 01:31:58.437
What are you doing?
Back in formation now!

01:32:50.030 --> 01:32:51.698
Holy shit!

01:32:52.908 --> 01:32:56.620
Don't!
They seem to react to movement.

01:33:14.554 --> 01:33:16.515
They're gone.

01:33:19.226 --> 01:33:24.189
We're close. I've seen it in your eyes.
Take me to Pandora's box.

01:33:24.398 --> 01:33:28.026
- I don't know how.
- Do it now!

01:33:29.695 --> 01:33:35.075
You were the one who wanted
to go for a walk. So start walking!

01:33:41.206 --> 01:33:44.167
The next one will be higher.

01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:25.500
Only with the orb can it be revealed.

01:34:26.668 --> 01:34:29.963
Only with the orb can it be revealed.

01:34:33.634 --> 01:34:36.261
All right. I'll need the orb.

01:34:37.721 --> 01:34:40.474
Do you want to see
The Cradle of Life or not?

01:34:40.682 --> 01:34:43.852
You tell me what to do with it.

01:35:40.659 --> 01:35:43.412
Don't think you can outwit me, Croft.

01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:46.456
Oh, do shut up!

01:35:47.708 --> 01:35:51.086
So, this is The Cradle of Life...

01:35:58.093 --> 01:36:00.053
Here we are.

01:36:01.221 --> 01:36:04.182
It's all yours. Time to be a hero.

01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:10.123
There it is.

01:37:21.301 --> 01:37:26.515
Perfect, isn't it? All that power
in such a banal container.

01:37:26.723 --> 01:37:32.437
When Pandora saw inside the box,
she cried black acid for tears.

01:37:32.646 --> 01:37:35.983
And, as it was a woman
who found the box,

01:37:36.191 --> 01:37:39.778
I see no reason to break with tradition.

01:37:39.987 --> 01:37:42.739
A woman should collect the box.

01:37:44.741 --> 01:37:46.368
Go on!

01:37:49.538 --> 01:37:52.624
It is impossible to reach.

01:37:53.959 --> 01:37:55.919
Now take it!

01:37:57.004 --> 01:37:59.089
Take it!

01:39:28.553 --> 01:39:31.139
I don't think so, Reiss!

01:40:25.944 --> 01:40:27.779
You OK?

01:40:28.530 --> 01:40:32.743
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- There you go.

01:40:38.540 --> 01:40:42.669
- You come prepared.
- I know how clumsy you are.

01:40:47.090 --> 01:40:49.509
Hillary and Bryce?

01:40:50.469 --> 01:40:52.763
They're fine.

01:41:06.652 --> 01:41:08.487
Thank you.

01:41:08.695 --> 01:41:10.572
What was that?

01:41:13.575 --> 01:41:15.535
Thank you.

01:41:28.048 --> 01:41:30.926
Let's get out of here.

01:41:40.102 --> 01:41:43.647
Terry? What are you doing?

01:41:44.982 --> 01:41:48.026
You're joking, right?

01:41:48.235 --> 01:41:51.571
We're taking this with us. This is ours.

01:41:52.864 --> 01:41:56.952
You're not walking out of here
with that box.

01:41:58.078 --> 01:42:02.666
So you're saying we just leave it,
when it's worth a fortune?

01:42:02.874 --> 01:42:05.377
- Put it back.
- I don't think so.

01:42:05.585 --> 01:42:08.380
It could kill millions
of innocent people.

01:42:08.588 --> 01:42:12.175
- Now you're being dramatic.
- Put it back.

01:42:12.384 --> 01:42:14.011
No!

01:42:16.555 --> 01:42:22.185
I've helped you keep this away
from Reiss. This is my reward.

01:42:23.228 --> 01:42:26.189
I'm taking it with me.

01:42:35.282 --> 01:42:38.076
So it's come to this, has it?

01:42:38.285 --> 01:42:41.788
Well, you do have
authorisation to kill me.

01:42:42.873 --> 01:42:45.208
Better do it, then.

01:42:45.417 --> 01:42:51.089
'Cause if you think standing
in front of me is gonna be enough...

01:42:52.507 --> 01:42:56.428
You don't have it in you to stop me.

01:43:04.353 --> 01:43:06.897
See, all your beliefs...

01:43:07.147 --> 01:43:11.193
...all your ideals, they're not real.

01:43:11.902 --> 01:43:15.530
I am. And you've loved me.

01:43:18.992 --> 01:43:24.915
You think you're strong,
but you'll not choose them over me.

01:43:28.627 --> 01:43:31.588
- Now move.
- No.

01:43:35.509 --> 01:43:36.969
Fine.

01:46:04.366 --> 01:46:07.619
The box is safe now.

01:46:09.162 --> 01:46:12.874
Some things are not meant to be found.

01:46:22.509 --> 01:46:25.345
Didn't you ever do anything
the easy way?

01:46:25.554 --> 01:46:28.473
I wouldn't want to disappoint you.

01:46:52.956 --> 01:46:55.500
- Lara, are you OK?
- All right?

01:46:55.709 --> 01:46:58.962
This is... very touching.

01:46:59.171 --> 01:47:02.883
You know us, always making friends,
having a laugh.

01:47:03.091 --> 01:47:05.093
Getting married...

01:47:06.345 --> 01:47:08.263
What?

01:47:08.930 --> 01:47:12.017
This is a wedding ceremony
and you are the grooms.

01:47:12.643 --> 01:47:15.604
Good luck, boys!

01:47:32.079 --> 01:47:33.705
Go!
