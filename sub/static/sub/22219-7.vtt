09:13.887 --> 09:15.321
<b>- We're gonna do</b>
<b>a Japanese dragon.</b>

09:15.322 --> 09:16.756
<b> <i>I need to play it safe.</i> </b>

09:16.757 --> 09:19.426
<b>- Five more hours.</b>
<b>Five more hours.</b>

09:23.230 --> 09:25.865
<b>- I've always wanted something</b>
<b>like that on my body, like...</b>

09:25.866 --> 09:28.734
<b>- This is easily one of</b>
<b>the most important tattoos</b>

09:28.735 --> 09:30.636
<b>I've done in my entire career.</b>

09:30.637 --> 09:33.039
<b>- It's really just kids get</b>
<b>freaked out about it,</b>

09:33.040 --> 09:34.473
<b>you know what I mean?</b>
<b>But if it's a picture,</b>

09:34.474 --> 09:36.042
<b>they won't get freaked out</b>
<b>about it.</b>

09:36.043 --> 09:38.110
<b>- This guy is 21 years old</b>

09:38.111 --> 09:42.248
<b>and he has a hole in his throat</b>
<b>that children are afraid of.</b>

09:42.249 --> 09:43.749
<b>Here we go.</b>

09:43.750 --> 09:48.120
<b>This is my chance to make it</b>
<b>just a little bit better.</b>

09:48.121 --> 09:49.555

<b>Everybody's gonna be</b>
<b>looking at your neck now.</b>

09:51.291 --> 09:52.658
<b>- They're looking at my neck</b>
<b>already.</b>

09:52.659 --> 09:54.594
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>In a good way though now.</b>

09:54.595 --> 09:57.698
<b>[tattoo machines buzzing]</b>

10:06.540 --> 10:08.541
<b>- Yeah. Yeah.</b>

10:08.542 --> 10:10.643
<b> <i>Scars have major tissue damage,</i> </b>

10:10.644 --> 10:13.246
<b>so it's not an easy thing</b>
<b>to endure.</b>

10:13.247 --> 10:14.780
<b>- Just the pain.</b>

10:14.781 --> 10:16.616
<b> <i>- If my canvass taps,</i> </b>
<b> <i>I'm gonna be so bummed out</i> </b>

10:16.617 --> 10:18.184
<b>not just for her but for myself.</b>

10:18.185 --> 10:20.052
<b> <i>I want to win this challenge.</i> </b>

10:20.053 --> 10:22.688
<b>- Stay still for me</b>
<b>just through this stuff, okay?</b>

10:22.689 --> 10:24.490
<b>The girls are getting tighter</b>
<b>every day.</b>

10:24.491 --> 10:26.926
<b>We can't let them get</b>
<b>too far ahead of themselves.</b>

10:26.927 --> 10:30.129
<b>- [groans]</b>
<b>- How you holding up?</b>

10:30.130 --> 10:32.732
<b>- That's a little more sensitive</b>
<b>than I figured it would be.</b>

10:32.733 --> 10:36.435
<b> <i>- Unfortunately, my canvas has</i> </b>
<b> <i>been through so many surgeries,</i> </b>

10:36.436 --> 10:38.471
<b>his nerves are all [bleep] up.</b>

10:38.472 --> 10:40.806
<b>One moment he's fine,</b>
<b>the next moment...</b>

10:40.807 --> 10:42.341
<b>- [groaning]</b>

10:42.342 --> 10:44.644
<b> <i>- He's in excruciating pain.</i> </b>

10:44.645 --> 10:45.978
<b>- [groans]</b>

10:45.979 --> 10:47.813
<b>- I might not be able</b>
<b>to finish this tattoo.</b>

10:47.814 --> 10:49.183
<b>We'll get through it, man.</b>

10:51.685 --> 10:56.556
<b>- Five, four, three, two, one.</b>

10:56.557 --> 10:59.458
<b>That's it. Time's up.</b>
<b>Machines down.</b>

10:59.459 --> 11:00.827
<b>No more ink.</b>

11:03.797 --> 11:07.200
<b>- Oh, my God. That's gorgeous.</b>
<b>That is beautiful.</b>

11:07.201 --> 11:10.469
<b>- There we are.</b>
<b>- That's sweet.</b>

11:10.470 --> 11:13.706
<b>- Kelly's throat scar cover-up</b>
<b>looks like a space jellyfish.</b>

11:13.707 --> 11:16.175
<b> <i>No way she's gonna win</i> </b>
<b> <i>the skull pick today.</i> </b>

11:16.176 --> 11:17.845
<b>- Awesome. I love it.</b> <b>Thank you.</b>

11:21.081 --> 11:22.748
<b>- All right, time to critique</b>
<b>your work,</b>

11:22.749 --> 11:25.451
<b>and we will start with Kelly.</b>

11:25.452 --> 11:27.787
<b>How was it sitting with Kelly?</b>

11:27.788 --> 11:29.589
<b>- She did a good job.</b>
<b>I'm very happy with it.</b>

11:29.590 --> 11:31.657
<b> <i>- I understand not wanting</i> </b>
<b> <i>to do a big black hole</i> </b>

11:31.658 --> 11:33.359
<b> <i>leading into a dark hole.</i> </b>

11:33.360 --> 11:35.728
<b>That was definitely</b>
<b>a smart, sensible play,</b>

11:35.729 --> 11:37.663
<b>but when I first look at it,</b>
<b>I don't get</b>

11:37.664 --> 11:40.333
<b> <i>this immediate sense</i> </b>
<b> <i>of space and galaxy.</i> </b>

11:40.334 --> 11:42.168
<b>- The way you worked</b>
<b>with the skin in that area,</b>

11:42.169 --> 11:44.904
<b> <i>you have some amazing color</i> </b>
<b> <i>blends, saturated color,</i> </b>

11:44.905 --> 11:46.739
<b> <i>and really bright color play,</i> </b>

11:46.740 --> 11:48.674
<b> <i>but you don't really get</i> </b>
<b> <i>a space feel</i> </b>

11:48.675 --> 11:51.777
<b> <i>from a distance</i> </b>
<b> <i>when you look at it.</i> </b>

11:51.778 --> 11:53.145
<b>- Eric.</b>

11:53.146 --> 11:55.715
<b> <i>- You've used his muscle shapes</i> </b>
<b> <i>to contour</i> </b>

11:55.716 --> 11:57.617
<b> <i>the mechanisms</i> </b>
<b> <i>that you put in there.</i> </b>

11:57.618 --> 11:59.218
<b>Definitely shows artistry.</b>

11:59.219 --> 12:01.287
<b>- You did some really clean,</b>
<b>strong outlining.</b>

12:01.288 --> 12:02.622
<b> <i>Even though it's thin,</i> </b>

12:02.623 --> 12:04.357
<b> <i>it works really well</i> </b>
<b> <i>with the contrast.</i> </b>

12:04.358 --> 12:06.126
<b>I think you did a great job.</b>
<b>- Thank you.</b>

12:07.528 --> 12:08.694
<b>- SketchyLawyer.</b>

12:08.695 --> 12:10.096
<b>- This tattoo came out</b>
<b>super slick.</b>

12:10.097 --> 12:11.531
<b> <i>Runs right up the middle</i> </b>
<b> <i>of the scar</i> </b>

12:11.532 --> 12:13.900
<b>and the feather texture</b>
<b>really hides the scar tissue.</b>

12:13.901 --> 12:16.068
<b>From a distance,</b>
<b>the lettering's a little busy.</b>

12:16.069 --> 12:17.637
<b>It's a little bit hard to read,</b>
<b>but once you get up on it,</b>

12:17.638 --> 12:20.072
<b> <i>it's super tight</i> </b>
<b> <i>and technically done.</i> </b>

12:20.073 --> 12:21.440
<b>- Kevin.</b>

12:21.441 --> 12:23.109
<b> <i>- This tattoo overall</i> </b>
<b> <i>looks really smooth.</i> </b>

12:23.110 --> 12:24.544
<b> <i>The nice texture in the fur,</i> </b>

12:24.545 --> 12:26.779
<b> <i>and even over top</i> </b>
<b> <i>of the heavy scarred areas...</i> </b>

12:26.780 --> 12:29.448
<b>you've got the same amount</b>
<b>of nice shading</b>

12:29.449 --> 12:31.984
<b> <i>over top of the scar</i> </b>
<b> <i>versus where the scar wasn't.</i> </b>

12:31.985 --> 12:34.353
<b>It's a quality tattoo.</b>
<b>- Thank you.</b>

12:34.354 --> 12:35.688
<b>- Tito.</b>

12:35.689 --> 12:37.156
<b>- It definitely hid the scar,</b>
<b>but as far as</b>

12:37.157 --> 12:38.691
<b> <i>the overall shape of the tattoo,</i> </b>

12:38.692 --> 12:40.726
<b> <i>the way it fit on the back,</i> </b>

12:40.727 --> 12:43.596
<b>it was a very odd placement.</b>
<b>- It's really not.</b>

12:43.597 --> 12:45.898
<b> <i>He has a pretty considerable</i> </b>
<b> <i>divot in his back,</i> </b>

12:45.899 --> 12:48.601
<b>so to place it where it is</b>
<b>fit the flow of the back</b>

12:48.602 --> 12:50.203
<b> <i>and definitely fit the</i> </b>
<b> <i>direction of the scar</i> </b>

12:50.204 --> 12:51.270
<b> <i>in my opinion.</i> </b>

12:51.271 --> 12:53.005
<b>It looks pretty good, man.</b>

12:53.006 --> 12:54.373
<b>- Nikki.</b>

12:54.374 --> 12:56.609
<b> <i>- He had this crazy</i> </b>
<b> <i>weird dragon.</i> </b>

12:56.610 --> 12:58.010
<b> <i>You made what he had</i> </b>
<b> <i>a lot better,</i> </b>

12:58.011 --> 12:59.412
<b> <i>and you got rid of the scar.</i> </b>

12:59.413 --> 13:01.280
<b>- The way that you used</b>
<b>the scar tissue</b>

13:01.281 --> 13:03.216
<b> <i>to play into that rocky texture</i> </b>

13:03.217 --> 13:06.452
<b>to camouflage it all</b>
<b>and tie it in, really good.</b>

13:06.453 --> 13:08.054
<b> <i>- All of the boys in this house</i> </b>

13:08.055 --> 13:09.922
<b>are definitely</b>
<b>gunning for the girls.</b>

13:09.923 --> 13:12.893
<b>If I don't win the skull pick,</b>
<b>I'm completely screwed.</b>

13:15.562 --> 13:17.196
<b>- Whoo do you like so far?</b>

13:17.197 --> 13:18.598
<b>- I hate Kevin's.</b> <b>I really do.</b>

13:18.599 --> 13:20.500
<b>It's exactly</b>
<b>what I told him not to do.</b>

13:20.501 --> 13:22.468
<b>- I thought</b>
<b>they send ugly tattoos home.</b>

13:22.469 --> 13:24.370
<b>- You don't like it, so,</b>
<b>I mean, don't treat me</b>

13:24.371 --> 13:25.705
<b>like I don't understand.</b>
<b>You don't know...</b>

13:25.706 --> 13:26.773
<b>- Crazy as [bleep]. Shh.</b>

13:29.601 --> 13:32.538
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

13:34.039 --> 13:37.141
<b>- All right, today Team Nuñez</b>
<b>has shown us artistry.</b>

13:37.142 --> 13:38.409
<b>You lead the opposing team.</b>

13:38.410 --> 13:40.211
<b>What are your thoughts here</b>
<b>for Team Nuñez?</b>

13:40.212 --> 13:41.979
<b> <i>- Nikki really shined today.</i> </b>

13:41.980 --> 13:45.016
<b> <i>The color fading, the way</i> </b>
<b> <i>she built off the other tattoo</i> </b>

13:45.017 --> 13:46.517
<b> <i>and brought the whole thing</i> </b>
<b> <i>together,</i> </b>

13:46.518 --> 13:49.253
<b>hid the scar, just killed it.</b>
<b>- I really like Eric's.</b>

13:49.254 --> 13:51.389
<b> <i>As far as artistry goes,</i> </b>
<b> <i>I think he shows the most</i> </b>

13:51.390 --> 13:53.257
<b> <i>because he used the scar tissue,</i> </b>

13:53.258 --> 13:55.426
<b> <i>he used the cuts,</i> </b>
<b> <i>he used all those shapes.</i> </b>

13:55.427 --> 13:57.395
<b> <i>Was confident in his skill set.</i> </b>

13:57.396 --> 13:59.630
<b>- Today he really got</b>
<b>a lot of tattooing done</b>

13:59.631 --> 14:00.932
<b>in the amount of time.</b>

14:00.933 --> 14:02.567
<b>- All right, guys.</b>
<b>Want to let them know?</b>

14:02.568 --> 14:04.469
<b>both: Yeah.</b> <b>- Cool.</b>

14:04.470 --> 14:06.737
<b>- All right, guys.</b>
<b>Today you had to use artistry</b>

14:06.738 --> 14:10.208
<b>to transform a scar</b>
<b>into a work of art.</b>

14:10.209 --> 14:11.576

<b>as a group today.</b>

<b>makes me happy to have you guys</b>
<b>repping for us.</b>

14:19.384 --> 14:21.119

<b>to quit smoking today?</b>

14:21.120 --> 14:23.287
<b>- Hell yeah.</b>
<b>I'll never smoke again.</b>

14:23.288 --> 14:25.990
<b>- My father would still be alive</b>
<b>today if he didn't smoke.</b>

14:25.991 --> 14:28.726
<b>You can't quit soon enough.</b>

14:28.727 --> 14:30.795

14:35.801 --> 14:37.001

17:22.867 --> 17:26.037
<b>from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers:</b>

17:26.038 --> 17:27.738
<b> <i>Donovan Smith.</i> </b>

17:27.739 --> 17:29.540
<b>- Go long.</b>
<b> <i>- I love football.</i> </b>

17:29.541 --> 17:31.876
<b>I'm super stoked that we got</b>
<b>an NFL player in the house.</b>

17:31.877 --> 17:34.011
<b>- Thanks for joining us, buddy.</b>
<b>- My pleasure.</b>

17:34.012 --> 17:36.080
<b>- All right, Nikki, you won</b>
<b>the flash challenge,</b>

17:36.081 --> 17:37.548
<b>so as you know,</b>

17:37.549 --> 17:41.786
<b>you have the power</b>
<b>to assign the canvasses.</b>

17:41.787 --> 17:45.256
<b>- Whatever strategy I did have,</b>
<b>I can't even use it now.</b>

17:45.257 --> 17:47.325
<b> <i>I don't know what new school is,</i> </b>

17:47.326 --> 17:49.994
<b>so now I don't even know</b>
<b>how to look out for myself</b>

17:49.995 --> 17:52.063
<b>or how to screw over somebody</b>
<b>here.</b>

17:52.064 --> 17:53.397
<b>What are you looking to get?</b>

17:53.398 --> 17:55.166
<b>- A new-school</b>
<b>Abraham Lincoln Monument</b>

17:55.167 --> 17:57.535
<b>with his quote etched</b>
<b>in the background.</b>

17:57.536 --> 17:59.070
<b>- What are you looking to get?</b>

17:59.071 --> 18:01.391
<b>- New-school Golden Gate Bridge</b>
<b>with a surfer in the water.</b>

18:03.175 --> 18:04.542
<b>- What are you looking to get?</b>

18:04.543 --> 18:07.445
<b>- Statue of Liberty with</b>
<b>New York kind of graffiti.</b>

18:07.446 --> 18:09.847
<b>- One of the biggest</b>
<b>characteristics of new school</b>

18:09.848 --> 18:13.017
<b>is bright, vibrant,</b>
<b>saturated color,</b>

18:13.018 --> 18:15.520
<b> <i>and it's hard to do that</i> </b>
<b> <i>on a dark canvas.</i> </b>

18:15.521 --> 18:18.289
<b>- I'd like to get a new-school</b>
<b>Taj Mahal and a crescent moon.</b>

18:18.290 --> 18:21.092
<b>- A new-school Colosseum</b>
<b>with a gladiator battle scene.</b>

18:21.093 --> 18:22.093
<b>- [whistles]</b>

18:22.094 --> 18:23.094
<b>[laughter]</b>

18:25.097 --> 18:28.866
<b>- I definitely do not want</b>
<b>the Roman Colosseum</b>

18:28.867 --> 18:30.868
<b> <i>because there's</i> </b>
<b> <i>a lot of work involved.</i> </b>

18:30.869 --> 18:33.971
<b>Whoever gets this canvas</b>
<b>is [bleep].</b>

18:33.972 --> 18:34.972
<b>- This is gonna be hard.</b>

18:36.809 --> 18:37.975
<b> <i>- Watching Nikki</i> </b>
<b> <i>do the skull pick</i> </b>

18:37.976 --> 18:39.610
<b> <i>is like watching a train wreck.</i> </b>

18:39.611 --> 18:42.047
<b>She looks completely confused.</b>

18:46.885 --> 18:49.253
<b>- Sorry, I take forever.</b>

18:49.254 --> 18:51.589
<b>I forgot to ask</b>
<b>where you guys want this.</b>

18:51.590 --> 18:53.591
<b>How did I forget that?</b>

18:53.592 --> 18:55.060
<b>It's too much thinking.</b>

18:56.728 --> 18:59.096
<b>- Okay, canvasses, one by one,</b>
<b>go ahead and read</b>

18:59.097 --> 19:01.766
<b>the artist's name</b>
<b>on the bottom of your skull.</b>

19:01.767 --> 19:02.767
<b>- Nikki.</b>

19:03.902 --> 19:05.137
<b>- Kevin.</b>

19:09.141 --> 19:11.209
<b>- SketchyLawyer.</b>

19:11.210 --> 19:12.477
<b> <i>- If she's trying to gun for me</i> </b>

19:12.478 --> 19:14.579
<b>thinking that I can't do</b>
<b>a new-school tattoo</b>

19:14.580 --> 19:16.682
<b> <i>on a darker canvas, she's crazy.</i> </b>

19:21.820 --> 19:22.820
<b>- Kelly.</b>

19:26.625 --> 19:28.092
<b>- Holy [bleep].</b>

19:28.093 --> 19:31.562
<b> <i>Nikki just gave Kelly</i> </b>
<b> <i>the worst possible canvas.</i> </b>

19:31.563 --> 19:33.764
<b> <i>What is she thinking?</i> </b>

19:33.765 --> 19:34.765
<b>- Tuff Tito.</b>

19:36.368 --> 19:38.069
<b>- Eric.</b>

19:38.070 --> 19:40.638
<b>- Team Nuñez,</b>
<b>you will have six hours</b>

19:40.639 --> 19:45.276
<b>to tattoo a famous</b>
<b>landmark new-school style.</b>

19:45.277 --> 19:49.113
<b>Based on your work,</b>
<b>one of you will close shop.</b>

19:49.114 --> 19:51.149
<b>Good luck.</b>

19:51.150 --> 19:52.683
<b>- Hello.</b>
<b>- Good to meet you, man.</b>

19:52.684 --> 19:54.619
<b>- Today we're doing</b>
<b>new-school landmarks.</b>

19:54.620 --> 19:56.988
<b>- So Taj Mahal.</b>
<b>- Statue of Liberty.</b>

19:56.989 --> 19:58.656
<b> <i>- Artistry is important because</i> </b>
<b> <i>they're gonna have to</i> </b>

19:58.657 --> 20:01.125
<b> <i>really come up with a design</i> </b>
<b> <i>that is uniquely theirs.</i> </b>

20:01.126 --> 20:02.393
<b>If you can't draw</b>
<b>on this tattoo,</b>

20:02.394 --> 20:03.795
<b>you're definitely gonna have</b>
<b>a hard time.</b>

20:03.796 --> 20:05.663
<b>- New-school [bleep]</b>
<b>is what I do, man.</b>

20:05.664 --> 20:07.031
<b>- For real?</b>

20:07.032 --> 20:09.767
<b>- You wanted the Colosseum.</b>

20:09.768 --> 20:12.870
<b>- I was looking for, like,</b>
<b>a action or a battle scene.</b>

20:12.871 --> 20:16.307
<b>Maybe a lion and a gladiator, or</b>
<b>the lion's down, head off.</b>

20:16.308 --> 20:18.409
<b>Glowing for any blood</b>
<b>that's down there.</b>

20:18.410 --> 20:19.844
<b>- Oh, my God.</b>

20:19.845 --> 20:22.246
<b> <i>My canvas wants everything</i> </b>
<b> <i>but the kitchen sink</i> </b>

20:22.247 --> 20:23.881
<b> <i>in his tattoo.</i> </b>

20:23.882 --> 20:26.451
<b>- I don't know how much I like</b>
<b>his head being overly sized.</b>

20:26.452 --> 20:29.320
<b>Can the body be kind of,</b>
<b>like, proportionate?</b>

20:29.321 --> 20:34.192
<b>- He doesn't want new school</b>
<b>on new-school day.</b>

20:34.193 --> 20:36.327
<b> <i>I got the hardest canvas</i> </b>
<b> <i>of the day.</i> </b>

20:36.328 --> 20:37.796
<b>Thanks, Nikki.</b>

20:40.128 --> 20:43.130
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

20:43.131 --> 20:47.601
<b> <i>♪</i> </b>

20:47.602 --> 20:48.836
<b>- What do you think?</b>

20:48.837 --> 20:51.238
<b>- Super cool.</b> <b>I'm super stoked.</b>

20:51.239 --> 20:53.107
<b>I would've picked him</b>
<b>for myself.</b>

20:53.108 --> 20:55.309
<b>I was like,</b>
<b>"Dude, what is Nikki doing now?</b>

20:55.310 --> 20:57.745
"<b>She's just, like, totally</b>
<b>hooking me up." Like...</b>

20:57.746 --> 20:59.580
<b>- Well, I thought yours</b>
<b>was gonna be really hard</b>

20:59.581 --> 21:02.083
<b>with his dark complexion.</b> <b>- Ooh.</b>

21:02.084 --> 21:03.951
<b>- And even if you do</b>
<b>do a good job,</b>

21:03.952 --> 21:06.587
<b>it won't look as good</b>
<b>compared to others.</b>

21:06.588 --> 21:08.222
<b>- Right.</b>

21:08.223 --> 21:10.191
<b>- No matter what I try to do</b>
<b>to stump the guys,</b>

21:10.192 --> 21:11.692
<b> <i>it's not working.</i> </b>

21:11.693 --> 21:14.328
<b>- Honestly, my guy wants</b>
<b>no exaggeration.</b>

21:14.329 --> 21:17.598
<b>He wants it full color</b>
<b>with the Colosseum</b>

21:17.599 --> 21:22.436
<b>with a gladiator fighting a lion</b>
<b>with a glowing sword.</b>

21:22.437 --> 21:24.639
<b>- Did I [bleep] you over?</b>

21:24.640 --> 21:26.173
<b>- Um...</b>

21:26.174 --> 21:27.675
<b>- Do you think you can do this?</b>

21:27.676 --> 21:29.610
<b>- Um... I have to.</b>

21:29.611 --> 21:34.348
<b>If I can't do it,</b>
<b>then I deserve to go home.</b>

21:34.349 --> 21:35.617
<b>- Oh, no.</b>

21:37.853 --> 21:40.788
<b>- All right, Team Nuñez,</b>
<b>this is your last chance</b>

21:40.789 --> 21:43.124
<b>to make it</b>
<b>into Chris's top five.</b>

21:43.125 --> 21:48.095
<b>You will all have six hours</b>
<b>to tattoo a new-school landmark.</b>

21:48.096 --> 21:52.099
<b>And your time starts now.</b>

21:52.100 --> 21:53.334
<b>- All right.</b>

21:53.335 --> 21:54.769
<b>- Go ahead</b>
<b>and put the stencil on you now.</b>

21:54.770 --> 21:56.137
<b>- If you can't draw</b>
<b>on this tattoo,</b>

21:56.138 --> 21:57.738
<b>you're definitely gonna</b>
<b>have a hard time.</b>

21:57.739 --> 22:01.075
<b>- The buildings, I'm gonna make</b>
<b>them just really contorted.</b>

22:01.076 --> 22:02.877
<b> <i>- This now is crunch time</i> </b>
<b> <i>for both teams.</i> </b>

22:02.878 --> 22:04.679
<b> <i>I think Ollie and I are</i> </b>
<b> <i>in a dead heat.</i> </b>

22:04.680 --> 22:06.247
<b> <i>I don't think anybody's really</i> </b>

22:06.248 --> 22:07.848
<b> <i>running off with this thing yet.</i> </b>

22:07.849 --> 22:09.250
<b>I just want to get to five,</b>

22:09.251 --> 22:11.452
<b>and then I'm gonna show him</b>
<b>what's up.</b>

22:11.453 --> 22:12.987
<b>- Instead of doing</b>
<b>this top part,</b>

22:12.988 --> 22:14.555
<b>I'm gonna just make that</b>
<b>the top of the torch</b>

22:14.556 --> 22:16.457
<b>and bring it, like,</b>
<b>behind there.</b>

22:16.458 --> 22:18.225
<b>- So it fits?</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

22:18.226 --> 22:19.961
<b>Is that a good call?</b> <b>- Yeah.</b>

22:19.962 --> 22:21.896
<b>For me as a captain, if my</b>
<b>team is supposed to be</b>

22:21.897 --> 22:23.331
<b> <i>the strongest</i> </b>
<b> <i>and best it can be,</i> </b>

22:23.332 --> 22:25.900
<b>then I'm happy</b>
<b>to get rid of the weak ones.</b>

22:25.901 --> 22:28.436
<b>- I wanted to make his head</b>
<b>abnormally large,</b>

22:28.437 --> 22:30.438
<b>but is his body small enough?</b>

22:30.439 --> 22:33.341
<b>- The traditional new school,</b>
<b>it wasn't just, like,</b>

22:33.342 --> 22:35.576
<b>big eyes and stretchy hands.</b>

22:35.577 --> 22:38.045
<b>You can do it any way you want.</b>

22:38.046 --> 22:40.514
<b>- I usually go into every tattoo</b>
<b>super confident,</b>

22:40.515 --> 22:44.853
<b>but now I'm really unsure</b>
<b>of every move that I'm making.</b>

22:51.159 --> 22:54.695
<b> <i>- Nikki gives me the Golden</i> </b>
<b> <i>Gate Bridge with a surfer.</i> </b>

22:54.696 --> 22:56.964
<b>I don't know</b>
<b>how I'm about to do this design.</b>

22:56.965 --> 23:00.534
<b>I am in a complete</b>
<b>different realm.</b>

23:00.535 --> 23:02.603
<b>Just the wave's coming up here.</b>

23:02.604 --> 23:05.139
<b>- You have a... you have a way</b>
<b>to pull something up real quick?</b>

23:05.140 --> 23:06.607
<b>- Yeah.</b>

23:06.608 --> 23:09.310
<b> <i>Chris gives me a lot of</i> </b>
<b> <i>different references for water,</i> </b>

23:09.311 --> 23:11.846
<b>which is more Japanese style,</b>
<b>more of his style.</b>

23:11.847 --> 23:13.414
<b>- That's what I want you</b>
<b>to work on.</b>

23:13.415 --> 23:14.582
<b>- The waves?</b>

23:14.583 --> 23:16.083
<b>It scares me to go into that</b>

23:16.084 --> 23:17.918
<b>knowing that I feel like I'd be</b>
<b>critiqued even harder</b>

23:17.919 --> 23:20.121
<b> <i>if I try to do something</i> </b>
<b> <i>that he's proficient in.</i> </b>

23:20.122 --> 23:22.323
<b> <i>I'll take a little bit</i> </b>
<b> <i>of his advice,</i> </b>

23:22.324 --> 23:24.326
<b>but I definitely</b>
<b>don't want to OD.</b>

23:25.994 --> 23:27.696
<b>- Five more hours.</b>

23:33.435 --> 23:35.069
<b>- I'm not a fast tattooer.</b>

23:35.070 --> 23:38.606
<b>I'm still trying to adapt</b>
<b>to this competition.</b>

23:38.607 --> 23:41.008
<b>I need to speed things up.</b>

23:41.009 --> 23:43.778
<b>Every which way I'm</b>
<b>stretching this girl's skin,</b>

23:43.779 --> 23:48.249
<b>I can't do a straight line</b>
<b>to save my [bleep] life.</b>

23:48.250 --> 23:50.217
<b>- What up, E?</b>
<b>- What up, man?</b>

23:50.218 --> 23:51.552
<b>- What happened?</b>
<b>Are you having problems?</b>

23:51.553 --> 23:55.389
<b>- Switched out, like,</b>
<b>three machines already.</b>

23:55.390 --> 23:57.358
<b>I might not be</b>
<b>able to finish this tattoo.</b>

23:57.359 --> 23:59.127
<b>- Two more hours to go.</b>

24:04.733 --> 24:06.167
<b>- I was a little nervous</b>
<b>at first</b>

24:06.168 --> 24:08.369
<b>'cause I saw one</b>
<b>of the new-school tattoos.</b>

24:08.370 --> 24:10.738
<b>I don't know, like, there was,</b>
<b>like, makeup on it.</b>

24:10.739 --> 24:12.606
<b>- I have, like, a style</b>
<b>that I do for, like,</b>

24:12.607 --> 24:14.575
<b>feminine new school,</b>
<b>and then I have a style</b>

24:14.576 --> 24:16.978
<b>that I do for,</b>
<b>like, masculine new school.</b>

24:16.979 --> 24:18.412
<b>It's just a little bit bolder.</b>

24:18.413 --> 24:22.616
<b>My canvas is a little</b>
<b>nervous about my design,</b>

24:22.617 --> 24:24.151
<b> <i>but he's going with it.</i> </b>

24:24.152 --> 24:27.054
<b> <i>The pressure for me to do</i> </b>
<b> <i>a really, really good job</i> </b>

24:27.055 --> 24:31.125
<b>on new-school day is</b>
<b>absolutely astronomical.</b>

24:31.126 --> 24:33.394
<b>- Kelly's is awesome.</b>

24:33.395 --> 24:35.029
<b>It's not even finished yet</b>

24:35.030 --> 24:37.598
<b>and it already looks like the</b>
<b>Colosseum, and it's new-school,</b>

24:37.599 --> 24:39.500
<b>and it's everything</b>
<b>the guy wanted.</b>

24:39.501 --> 24:41.403
<b>- This is your final hour.</b>

24:44.172 --> 24:46.407
<b>- I'm worried</b>
<b>if I go to the panel today,</b>

24:46.408 --> 24:48.142
<b>my report card</b>
<b>can't help me too much.</b>

24:48.143 --> 24:50.746
<b>I got to prove that</b>
<b>I can be in the top ten.</b>

24:52.514 --> 24:53.948
<b>- My man Tito's in deep [bleep].</b>

24:53.949 --> 24:55.116
<b>- Yeah, you're not looking good</b>
<b>right now.</b>

24:55.117 --> 24:56.250
<b>- That mouth.</b>

24:56.251 --> 24:59.286
<b>- Drawing is key today.</b>

24:59.287 --> 25:01.622
<b>- It's like she just sucked</b>
<b>on a lemon.</b>

25:01.623 --> 25:03.224
<b>- Who do you like so far?</b>

25:03.225 --> 25:04.258
<b>- I like Kevin's.</b>

25:04.259 --> 25:05.793
<b>- I hate Kevin's. I hate it.</b>

25:05.794 --> 25:07.728
<b>I hate that water.</b>

25:07.729 --> 25:10.264
<b>It's exactly what I told him</b>
<b>not to do.</b>

25:10.265 --> 25:13.267
<b>- Babe-raham Lincoln over here</b>
<b>is a little weird too.</b>

25:13.268 --> 25:15.436
<b>- Looks more like you.</b>

25:15.437 --> 25:17.805
<b>- It doesn't, like, have</b>
<b>that harsh forced perspective</b>

25:17.806 --> 25:19.307
<b>that we would have</b>
<b>with a bobble head</b>

25:19.308 --> 25:21.008
<b>with tiny feet and a big head.</b>

25:21.009 --> 25:22.009
<b>- I don't know.</b>

25:27.616 --> 25:34.088
<b>- Five, four, three, two, one.</b>

25:34.089 --> 25:36.590
<b>That is it. Time's up.</b>
<b>Machines down.</b>

25:36.591 --> 25:37.858
<b>No more ink.</b>

25:37.859 --> 25:40.394
<b>- This gonna look good</b>
<b>on the field, man.</b>

25:40.395 --> 25:41.529
<b>- Pleasure, man.</b>

25:41.530 --> 25:44.165
<b>- Hell yeah.</b>
<b>Appreciate it, baby.</b>

25:44.166 --> 25:47.268
<b>- I don't even know if Tuff Tito</b>
<b>has seen the Statue of Liberty</b>

25:47.269 --> 25:51.238
<b> <i>because his is a really weird,</i> </b>
<b> <i>ugly version.</i> </b>

25:51.239 --> 25:54.875
<b>She has one eye that's really</b>
<b>huge and one eye that's not.</b>

25:54.876 --> 25:56.510
<b> <i>That's not new school.</i> </b>

25:56.511 --> 25:59.647
<b>That's just not knowing</b>
<b>how to proportion a face.</b>

25:59.648 --> 26:01.750
<b>- Appreciate it.</b>
<b>- Thank you for working on me.</b>

26:02.985 --> 26:04.118
<b>- Nikki's got</b>
<b>a [bleep] motormouth</b>

<b>by transforming</b>
<b>a famous landmark</b>

27:16.893 --> 27:18.894

27:18.895 --> 27:23.431
<b>Eric, let's start with you.</b>

27:23.432 --> 27:24.833
<b>- Overall, your background</b>

27:24.834 --> 27:26.535
<b> <i>and the way you played</i> </b>
<b> <i>the negative into it</i> </b>

27:26.536 --> 27:28.336
<b> <i>works really well</i> </b>
<b> <i>for your design.</i> </b>

27:28.337 --> 27:29.805
<b>You have some really</b>
<b>nice line work,</b>

27:29.806 --> 27:31.173
<b> <i>some nice areas here.</i> </b>

27:31.174 --> 27:33.375
<b>You have a lot of small,</b>
<b>thin parallel lines.</b>

27:33.376 --> 27:36.711
<b>- I love the juxtaposition</b>
<b>of these really bright colors</b>

27:36.712 --> 27:39.414
<b> <i>and the primarily</i> </b>
<b> <i>black-and-gray structure,</i> </b>

27:39.415 --> 27:41.049
<b>gives this building some life.</b>

27:41.050 --> 27:43.752
<b>One of the things about</b>
<b>an inanimate landmark new-school</b>

27:43.753 --> 27:45.887
<b> <i>is to make it become</i> </b>
<b> <i>a character,</i> </b>

27:45.888 --> 27:47.323
<b>and I think that you hit that.</b>

27:49.592 --> 27:50.693
<b>Kevin.</b>

27:53.796 --> 27:58.200
<b>- The water, it's such a harsh</b>
<b>just unfluid, unliquid,</b>

27:58.201 --> 28:00.602
<b> <i>unflattering beginning</i> </b>
<b> <i>to this tattoo.</i> </b>

28:00.603 --> 28:02.971
<b>Why did you abandon all</b>
<b>the good [bleep] I showed you?</b>

28:02.972 --> 28:05.073
<b>- A lot of the waves were,</b>
<b>like, super, super detailed,</b>

28:05.074 --> 28:06.675
<b> <i>and I didn't know how that</i> </b>
<b> <i>would look up against,</i> </b>

28:06.676 --> 28:08.510
<b> <i>like, a super simple drawing.</i> </b>

28:08.511 --> 28:10.679
<b>- So [bleep] the reference.</b>

28:10.680 --> 28:12.214
<b>Why did you stop outlining?</b>

28:12.215 --> 28:14.549
<b> <i>All that rich, black outline</i> </b>
<b> <i>that's everywhere</i> </b>

28:14.550 --> 28:18.019
<b> <i>in the entire body</i> </b>
<b> <i>as a perimeter just stops,</i> </b>

28:18.020 --> 28:21.156
<b>and then everything behind him</b>
<b>is not outlined.</b>

28:21.157 --> 28:22.791
<b> <i>How does that</i> </b>
<b> <i>brain process work?</i> </b>

28:22.792 --> 28:25.227
<b>- 'Cause I wanted the wave and</b>
<b>the back of the surfboard</b>

28:25.228 --> 28:28.296
<b>and the bridge to all be</b>
<b>inferred as the background,</b>

28:28.297 --> 28:29.865
<b>I abandoned the outline.</b>

28:29.866 --> 28:31.666
<b>- Your tattoo</b>
<b>just looks unfinished.</b>

28:31.667 --> 28:33.902
<b>I'm not at all mad</b>
<b>about the artistry in this.</b>

28:33.903 --> 28:35.704
<b>It was the follow-through</b>
<b>in the tattooing</b>

28:35.705 --> 28:39.341
<b>and the finished look</b>
<b>of the tattoo.</b>

28:39.342 --> 28:40.343
<b>- Kelly.</b>

28:43.412 --> 28:46.047
<b>- Testing artistry today,</b>
<b>this is where you really shine.</b>

28:46.048 --> 28:48.416
<b> <i>This is a great drawing,</i> </b>
<b> <i>great illustration.</i> </b>

28:48.417 --> 28:51.386
<b> <i>The details are spot-on.</i> </b>

28:51.387 --> 28:54.356
<b>The way you executed</b>
<b>the Colosseum is brilliant.</b>

28:54.357 --> 28:56.224
<b>- I did morph it a little bit,</b>

28:56.225 --> 28:58.560
<b> <i>but I wanted to keep it</i> </b>
<b> <i>somewhat true to form</i> </b>

28:58.561 --> 29:00.562
<b> <i>and then use other elements</i> </b>

29:00.563 --> 29:03.165
<b>to bring in a more</b>
<b>new-school-y kind of feel.</b>

29:03.166 --> 29:04.699
<b>- The artistry stands strong.</b>

29:04.700 --> 29:07.068
<b> <i>The way that the character</i> </b>
<b> <i>fades off</i> </b>

29:07.069 --> 29:08.637
<b> <i>before it hits the Colosseum</i> </b>

29:08.638 --> 29:11.473
<b>and that color blast comes out</b>
<b>is a great use of contrast.</b>

29:11.474 --> 29:14.776
<b>The details in the musculature</b>
<b>of the guy and the skin tone,</b>

29:14.777 --> 29:17.814
<b>to scratches in his face,</b>
<b>it's great tattooing.</b>

29:20.616 --> 29:21.717
<b>- SketchyLawyer.</b>

29:23.586 --> 29:25.220
<b>- Having to go</b>
<b>black and gray color</b>

29:25.221 --> 29:26.755
<b> <i>is not really</i> </b>
<b> <i>that big of a a deficit.</i> </b>

29:26.756 --> 29:29.291
<b> <i>Using your own artistry to</i> </b>
<b> <i>really create a dynamic image,</i> </b>

29:29.292 --> 29:31.560
<b> <i>that is the area in this</i> </b>
<b> <i>challenge where you excelled.</i> </b>

29:31.561 --> 29:33.328
<b> <i>But what's up with her eyes?</i> </b>

29:33.329 --> 29:34.729
<b> <i>- They were just kind of ghosty.</i> </b>

29:34.730 --> 29:36.231
<b> <i>And I didn't really</i> </b>
<b> <i>put pupils in there.</i> </b>

29:36.232 --> 29:37.532
<b> <i>I shaded off the top</i> </b>

29:37.533 --> 29:39.067
<b>and then just put some</b>
<b>white highlights in it.</b>

29:39.068 --> 29:41.937
<b>- You got this jawline of a</b>
<b>beautiful girl and flowing hair,</b>

29:41.938 --> 29:44.072
<b> <i>and then you got these</i> </b>
<b> <i>just weird eyes</i> </b>

29:44.073 --> 29:45.407
<b> <i>that are on the different plane.</i> </b>

29:45.408 --> 29:46.641
<b>Pretty out of whack.</b>

29:46.642 --> 29:48.176
<b>How do you feel</b>
<b>about the white in there?</b>

29:48.177 --> 29:49.578
<b>- I don't like the white at all.</b>

29:49.579 --> 29:51.613
<b>- But I think it looks nice</b>
<b>in the nose and the lip.</b>

29:51.614 --> 29:53.081
<b> <i>- In football practice,</i> </b>

29:53.082 --> 29:54.783
<b> <i>he's beating the [bleep]</i> </b>
<b> <i>out of that thing.</i> </b>

29:54.784 --> 29:56.485
<b>And looking at who he is and</b>
<b>he's like this every day...</b>

29:56.486 --> 29:57.919
<b>down, set, hike...</b> <b>with the sun</b>

29:57.920 --> 29:59.680
<b>beating the [bleep]</b>
<b>out of it, that's a wrap.</b>

30:02.391 --> 30:03.391
<b>- Nikki.</b>

30:05.828 --> 30:07.863
<b>- It's questionable whether</b>
<b>people are gonna recognize this</b>

30:07.864 --> 30:09.364
<b> <i>as the Lincoln Memorial.</i> </b>

30:09.365 --> 30:11.333
<b> <i>You got to force that</i> </b>
<b> <i>perspective all the way down</i> </b>

30:11.334 --> 30:12.634
<b> <i>so you could show both hands,</i> </b>

30:12.635 --> 30:14.169
<b> <i>maybe show more of the memorial.</i> </b>

30:14.170 --> 30:16.004
<b>The feet should be this big and</b>
<b>the head should be this big.</b>

30:16.005 --> 30:18.773
<b>That's, like,</b>
<b>a hard-forced perspective.</b>

30:18.774 --> 30:22.477
<b>- My handicap in this is I've</b>
<b>been tattooing for five years.</b>

30:22.478 --> 30:24.312
<b>I don't know this style</b>
<b>very well.</b>

30:24.313 --> 30:26.515
<b>- I really dislike</b>
<b>the shape of the background.</b>

30:26.516 --> 30:29.451
<b> <i>This hard-shaped patch</i> </b>
<b> <i>looks super off.</i> </b>

30:29.452 --> 30:31.286
<b> <i>I hate</i> </b> <b> <i>the cupcake-frosting hair</i> </b>

30:31.287 --> 30:32.787
<b> <i>all the way around the face.</i> </b>

30:32.788 --> 30:33.922
<b>What happened?</b>

30:33.923 --> 30:35.624
<b>- I was struggling a lot</b>
<b>with making sure</b>

30:35.625 --> 30:39.828
<b>that it wasn't too wacky,</b>
<b>too unrecognizable.</b>

30:39.829 --> 30:43.365
<b>- Your limitations of what you</b>
<b>thought was crazy held you back.</b>

30:43.366 --> 30:44.400
<b>You got lame.</b>

30:47.136 --> 30:48.136
<b>- Tito.</b>

30:50.439 --> 30:51.840
<b>- Testing artistry,</b>

30:51.841 --> 30:53.809
<b>I have a multitude of problems</b>
<b>with this drawing.</b>

30:53.810 --> 30:56.044
<b> <i>The mouth is completely jacked.</i> </b>

30:56.045 --> 30:57.445
<b> <i>It's out of shape.</i> </b>

30:57.446 --> 30:59.414
<b> <i>Statue of Liberty,</i> </b>
<b> <i>seven points on her crown.</i> </b>

30:59.415 --> 31:00.916
<b> <i>You have six.</i> </b>

31:00.917 --> 31:02.884
<b>And that last point</b>
<b>on the other side of the head,</b>

31:02.885 --> 31:05.487
<b>there's no way that point</b>
<b>is connected to that crown</b>

31:05.488 --> 31:07.355
<b>in the direction</b>
<b>that crown is turning.</b>

31:07.356 --> 31:09.057
<b>- New school. You bend it.</b>

31:09.058 --> 31:12.527
<b>- Just because it's new school</b>
<b>doesn't mean it's ugly.</b>

31:12.528 --> 31:14.362
<b>It's weird choices.</b>

31:14.363 --> 31:16.698
<b> <i>This is where your artistry</i> </b>
<b> <i>is falling short.</i> </b>

31:16.699 --> 31:18.733
<b>You should've just looked</b>
<b>at the Statue of Liberty</b>

31:18.734 --> 31:20.169
<b>and drawn your own version.</b>

31:25.608 --> 31:27.008
<b>- All right, guys,</b>
<b>time to determine</b>

31:27.009 --> 31:29.277
<b>who had the best</b>
<b>tattoo of the day.</b>

31:29.278 --> 31:32.247
<b>- Eric and Kelly.</b>
<b>- I agree. Those are my top two.</b>

31:32.248 --> 31:34.616
<b>- Kelly definitely hit</b>
<b>new school stronger than Eric,</b>

31:34.617 --> 31:37.252
<b>but if you just compare the</b>
<b>quality and the detail</b>

31:37.253 --> 31:41.423
<b>in Kelly's Colosseum to the</b>
<b>Taj Mahal, really over the top.</b>

31:41.424 --> 31:44.259
<b>- Eric definitely put his balls</b>
<b>on the chopping block</b>

31:44.260 --> 31:46.294
<b> <i>and did a [bleep] load</i> </b>
<b> <i>of tiny little straight lines</i> </b>

31:46.295 --> 31:49.030
<b>side by side by side by side</b>
<b>and just owned it.</b>

31:49.031 --> 31:50.365
<b>- We're talking about artistry.</b>

31:50.366 --> 31:53.034
<b>Kelly had the foresight</b>
<b>to plan alcoves</b>

31:53.035 --> 31:55.103
<b> <i>and little windows lined in red</i> </b>

31:55.104 --> 31:57.739
<b>because this thing is gonna be</b>
<b>glowing from the inside.</b>

31:57.740 --> 31:59.474
<b>- Oh, I mean,</b>
<b>just the drawing itself.</b>

31:59.475 --> 32:01.476
<b>I mean, she drew</b>
<b>that figure from scratch.</b>

32:01.477 --> 32:04.613
<b>I think that the artistry shows</b>
<b>really, really strong.</b>

32:04.614 --> 32:06.081
<b>My vote's for Kelly.</b>

32:06.082 --> 32:08.316
<b>- I'm going with Eric.</b>

32:08.317 --> 32:10.719
<b>- I'm going for Kelly.</b>

32:10.720 --> 32:14.089
<b>The judges have decided that the</b>
<b>best tattoo of the day</b>

32:14.090 --> 32:15.490
<b>goes to Kelly.</b>

32:15.491 --> 32:18.126
<b>Well done.</b> <b>- Thank you.</b>

32:18.127 --> 32:19.694
<b>- All right, Team Nuñez,</b>
<b>one of you</b>

32:19.695 --> 32:21.463
<b>is about to pack your machines,</b>

32:21.464 --> 32:23.800
<b>and all of you</b>
<b>can head up to the loft.</b>

32:27.670 --> 32:29.104
<b>- What the [bleep]'s going on?</b>

32:29.105 --> 32:31.139
<b>Like, are you going home</b>
<b>over this bull[bleep]?</b>

32:31.140 --> 32:32.841
<b>- See what they say.</b>
<b>They have the last word.</b>

32:32.842 --> 32:34.376
<b>- Tito.</b>
<b>- You know what I mean?</b>

32:34.377 --> 32:35.777
<b>- I just don't want to see you</b>
<b>go out, like, whatever.</b>

32:35.778 --> 32:38.246
<b>- Me whatever?</b>
<b>No, bro. I'll never quit.</b>

32:38.247 --> 32:39.548
<b>I'm gonna stand for what I do.</b>

32:39.549 --> 32:40.682
<b>- You go down there,</b>
<b>Kevin goes down there,</b>

32:40.683 --> 32:42.517
<b>make it be not about</b>
<b>Kevin and Tito.</b>

32:42.518 --> 32:45.020
<b>Make it be about Nikki.</b>

32:45.021 --> 32:47.189

32:47.190 --> 32:49.291

<b>This chick's 24 years old</b>

32:49.292 --> 32:51.092

32:52.795 --> 32:55.063
<b>She's got a [bleep] motormouth</b>
<b>and don't know when to shut up.</b>

32:55.064 --> 32:57.265
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- I say steamroll her.</b>

32:57.266 --> 32:59.668
<b>- If I go downstairs, which it</b>
<b>look like I will,</b>

32:59.669 --> 33:01.436
<b>I'm ready, bro. I'm good.</b>

33:01.437 --> 33:03.872
<b>I like challenges,</b>
<b>and I don't think being here</b>

33:03.873 --> 33:06.675
<b>is a harder situation</b>
<b>than I have in my life.</b>

33:06.676 --> 33:08.276
<b>I'm a [bleep] warrior.</b>
<b>I don't quit.</b>

33:08.277 --> 33:11.547
<b>I don't quit anything.</b>
<b>I'll fight until I die.</b>

33:15.552 --> 33:18.087
<b> <i>[intense music]</i> </b>

33:18.088 --> 33:19.288
<b>- Okay, we're here to determine</b>

33:19.289 --> 33:21.090
<b>who has the worst tattoo</b>
<b>of the day</b>

33:21.091 --> 33:22.592
<b>and who we're putting up</b>
<b>for elimination.</b>

33:22.593 --> 33:25.862
<b>- I got to say Kevin.</b>
<b>The wave is ugly.</b>

33:25.863 --> 33:27.864
<b> <i>- There's mistakes</i> </b>
<b> <i>that he claims</i> </b>

33:27.865 --> 33:31.167
<b>he put in there on purpose,</b>
<b>but it makes no sense.</b>

33:31.168 --> 33:33.336
<b> <i>Like, you wouldn't have</i> </b>
<b> <i>a black line just stopping,</i> </b>

33:33.337 --> 33:35.004
<b> <i>and then start of no line.</i> </b>

33:35.005 --> 33:36.472
<b>That is whack.</b>

33:36.473 --> 33:38.408
<b>But, I mean, it's still not as</b>
<b>bad as Tito's.</b>

33:38.409 --> 33:39.542
<b> <i>It looks like a floating head.</i> </b>

33:39.543 --> 33:42.111
<b>- Those lines on top [bleep]</b>
<b>kill it.</b>

33:42.112 --> 33:46.149
<b>Four not filled in</b>
<b>teal lines on the skin.</b>

33:46.150 --> 33:47.417
<b>- You know what though?</b>

33:47.418 --> 33:49.185
<b>It does look like</b>
<b>the Statue of Liberty</b>

33:49.186 --> 33:51.220
<b>compared to Nikki's tattoo.</b>

33:51.221 --> 33:53.089
<b> <i>This doesn't look like</i> </b>
<b> <i>the Lincoln Monument.</i> </b>

33:53.090 --> 33:55.758
<b> <i>- And that hand, it looks like</i> </b>
<b> <i>a little ornamental piece</i> </b>

33:55.759 --> 33:57.493
<b> <i>on a colonel's suit.</i> </b>

33:57.494 --> 33:59.829
<b>I don't think it meets</b>
<b>the landmark challenge at all.</b>

33:59.830 --> 34:01.964
<b>both: The challenge</b>
<b>was artistry.</b>

34:01.965 --> 34:04.333
<b>- But we have to be genuine</b>
<b>about who we think</b>

34:04.334 --> 34:06.302
<b>genuinely had the worst tattoo.</b>
<b>- Yeah, yeah.</b>

34:06.303 --> 34:08.471
<b>- It's not about who we want</b>
<b>to go down to the bottom.</b>

34:08.472 --> 34:11.541
<b>- It seems like you don't agree</b>
<b>that this is the worst tattoo.</b>

34:11.542 --> 34:13.208
<b> <i>- Nikki missed the mark</i> </b>
<b> <i>on this one,</i> </b>

34:13.210 --> 34:16.846
<b>but at least she drew</b>
<b>this tattoo... she designed it.</b>

34:16.847 --> 34:18.313
<b>Tito did not.</b>

34:18.315 --> 34:21.951
<b>- This one is definitely</b>
<b>neck-and-neck with Tito's.</b>

34:21.952 --> 34:25.955
<b>- So Team Nuñez narrowing it</b>
<b>down to the top five artists.</b>

34:25.956 --> 34:28.658
<b>And we're testing artistry</b>
<b>with new-school landmarks.</b>

34:28.659 --> 34:30.793
<b> <i>Let's start with Kevin.</i> </b>
<b> <i>I actually like this tattoo.</i> </b>

34:30.793 --> 34:32.395
<b> <i>Chris, you don't seem as happy</i> </b>
<b> <i>about it.</i> </b>

34:32.396 --> 34:35.831
<b>- It takes artistry to be able</b>
<b>to understand how water moves,</b>

34:35.833 --> 34:37.400
<b>what water should look like.</b>

34:37.400 --> 34:39.435
<b>Kevin just doesn't listen,</b>
<b>and I'm just frustrated</b>

34:39.436 --> 34:41.704
<b>because I'm telling you and you</b>
<b>still don't want to do it?</b>

34:41.705 --> 34:43.239
<b>And you want to make this</b>
<b>bull[bleep]?</b>

34:43.239 --> 34:45.074
<b>Get out of here.</b>

34:45.074 --> 34:47.076
<b>- Who's in your bottom, Oliver?</b>
<b>- Definitely Tito.</b>

34:47.077 --> 34:49.178
<b> <i>Call it new school, say</i> </b>
<b> <i>you can twist it and warp it,</i> </b>

34:49.179 --> 34:50.780
<b> <i>that doesn't mean make it ugly.</i> </b>

34:50.781 --> 34:53.882
<b> <i>- I think he went as safe as he</i> </b>
<b> <i>could and in his mind thought,</i> </b>

34:53.884 --> 34:55.016
<b>"This is gonna be good enough</b>

34:55.018 --> 34:56.284
<b>for me to beat</b>
<b>one other person."</b>

34:56.286 --> 34:58.187
<b>I mean, he just did</b>
<b>a floating head.</b>

34:58.188 --> 35:00.223
<b>You are fighting for your life.</b>

35:00.224 --> 35:01.991
<b>- I got to say,</b>
<b>my vote is Nikki.</b>

35:01.992 --> 35:05.328
<b> <i>She didn't show the monument.</i> </b>
<b> <i>The artistry is lacking there.</i> </b>

35:05.329 --> 35:07.363
<b>- And she's very confident in</b>
<b>her skill set and she's cocky,</b>

35:07.364 --> 35:10.566
<b>and she needs to be</b>
<b>working harder than this</b>

35:10.567 --> 35:13.102
<b>to keep running that mouth.</b>

35:13.103 --> 35:14.937
<b>- Jury of peers is gonna vote</b>
<b>someone to the bottom.</b>

35:14.938 --> 35:17.373
<b>It's gonna be interesting, man.</b>
<b>Top five. You ready?</b>

35:17.374 --> 35:18.775
<b>- I am.</b>
<b>- You ready?</b>

35:18.776 --> 35:20.843
<b>All right.</b>

35:20.844 --> 35:23.646
<b>- It was kind of tough.</b>
<b>We had to discuss them all.</b>

35:23.647 --> 35:25.481
<b>- You really had to</b>
<b>discuss them all?</b>

35:25.482 --> 35:28.185
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- Well, we were not unified.</b>

35:38.028 --> 35:41.198
<b>- Jury of peers, who are you</b>
<b>putting down for elimination?</b>

35:46.303 --> 35:49.872
<b>- We have decided to put</b>
<b>Tuff Tito up for elimination.</b>

35:49.873 --> 35:55.611
<b>- All right. We'll see</b>
<b>Tito, Kevin, and Nikki,</b>

35:55.612 --> 35:57.881
<b>and the jury of peers</b>
<b>downstairs.</b>

35:59.750 --> 36:01.851
<b>- How you feel, buddy?</b>
<b>- I'm feeling good.</b>

36:01.852 --> 36:03.119
<b>I will be back here.</b>

36:03.120 --> 36:05.188
<b>AGuarantee you that.</b>
<b>Let's go, guys.</b>

36:05.189 --> 36:12.129
<b> <i>♪</i> </b>

36:17.101 --> 36:20.703
<b>- Today you had to tattoo a</b>
<b>landmark new-school style,</b>

36:20.704 --> 36:25.241
<b>and based on your work,</b>
<b>one of you will close shop.</b>

36:25.242 --> 36:27.143
<b>Time to hear</b>
<b>from the jury of peers.</b>

36:27.144 --> 36:30.213
<b>Team Peck, why did you vote</b>
<b>Tito to the bottom?</b>

36:30.214 --> 36:33.282
<b>- There was just so many things</b>
<b>wrong with it.</b>

36:33.283 --> 36:35.985
<b> <i>The hairline,</i> </b>
<b> <i>the eyes, the eyebrows.</i> </b>

36:35.986 --> 36:38.121
<b>He was thinking</b>
<b>just 'cause it's new school</b>

36:38.122 --> 36:40.189
<b>he could just do</b>
<b>whatever with it,</b>

36:40.190 --> 36:42.024
<b>but it still has to look good.</b>

36:42.025 --> 36:44.627
<b>- But does it look like the</b>
<b>Statue of Liberty? All day.</b>

36:44.628 --> 36:45.962
<b>- Tito, where did you even try</b>
<b>in the drawing process?</b>

36:45.963 --> 36:47.864
<b>- Excuse me. I'm talking to him.</b>

36:47.865 --> 36:49.966
<b>- The biggest letdown</b>
<b>of this whole thing</b>

36:49.967 --> 36:52.034
<b>is just doing a floating head.</b>

36:52.035 --> 36:55.271
<b> <i>It's a monument,</i> </b>
<b> <i>and if all you're gonna do</i> </b>

36:55.272 --> 36:57.540
<b>to stay in this competition</b>
<b>is draw a head,</b>

36:57.541 --> 36:59.475
<b>then you wrote your own ticket.</b>

36:59.476 --> 37:00.643
<b>- You know I got the</b>
<b>fundamentals.</b>

37:00.644 --> 37:02.044
<b>Some other people,</b>

37:02.045 --> 37:03.446
<b>they can't pull straight lines</b>
<b>when they want.</b>

37:03.447 --> 37:04.881
<b>- Well, who are you talking</b>
<b>about specifically?</b>

37:04.882 --> 37:06.149
<b>- Kevin's tattoo.</b>

37:06.150 --> 37:07.583
<b>- You can zoom into</b>
<b>any part of that tattoo,</b>

37:07.584 --> 37:08.985
<b> <i>and I guarantee you</i> </b>
<b> <i>every line in that tattoo</i> </b>

37:08.986 --> 37:11.354
<b>is straighter</b>
<b>than every line in yours.</b>

37:11.355 --> 37:14.557
<b>- So, yes, this tattoo does</b>
<b>display fundamentals.</b>

37:14.558 --> 37:15.925
<b> <i>There are some great details,</i> </b>

37:15.926 --> 37:18.995
<b>but overall,</b>
<b>it has an unfinished feel to it.</b>

37:18.996 --> 37:21.831
<b>- The fact that you did the</b>
<b>foreground of your tattoo</b>

37:21.832 --> 37:24.634
<b> <i>with a big, heavy line</i> </b>
<b> <i>and then just fuzzed it out</i> </b>

37:24.635 --> 37:26.102
<b>is so questionable, man.</b>

37:26.103 --> 37:28.738
<b>- Out of today's challenge,</b>
<b>of all the tattoos,</b>

37:28.739 --> 37:31.040
<b>mine was definitely one of</b>
<b>the ones that hit all aspects.</b>

37:31.041 --> 37:32.408
<b>You definitely see that</b>

37:32.409 --> 37:33.976
<b>that's the Golden Gate Bridge</b>
<b>behind him.</b>

37:33.977 --> 37:35.278
<b>You definitely see</b>
<b>that's a surfer.</b>

37:35.279 --> 37:36.813
<b>I made it new-school.</b>

37:36.814 --> 37:39.549
<b>- But I thought the challenge</b>
<b>was a new-school landmark,</b>

37:39.550 --> 37:42.552
<b>and when I look at that tattoo,</b>
<b>I see a realistic landmark.</b>

37:42.553 --> 37:45.588
<b>- The main part of the tattoo is</b>
<b>the man in front.</b>

37:45.589 --> 37:47.423
<b>- I thought</b>
<b>it's the landmark though.</b>

37:47.424 --> 37:48.958
<b>- But then if that's the case,</b>
<b>then who's to say</b>

37:48.959 --> 37:51.527
<b>that yours hit the challenge</b>
<b>at all then?</b>

37:51.528 --> 37:53.863
<b>- The keyword today</b>
<b>was a landmark, Nikki,</b>

37:53.864 --> 37:55.698
<b>so you needed to show</b>
<b>more of the image.</b>

37:55.699 --> 37:58.334
<b>- I think it's not</b>
<b>being completely knowledgeable</b>

37:58.335 --> 37:59.836
<b>of what new school is.</b>
<b>- It's just that we don't...</b>

37:59.837 --> 38:01.637
<b>- And I just didn't put his</b>
<b>whole body in there.</b>

38:01.638 --> 38:03.239
<b>- We don't know</b>
<b>that this is the memorial.</b>

38:03.240 --> 38:05.109
<b>That's the main issue.</b>

38:08.545 --> 38:11.981
<b>Judges, time to determine</b>
<b>who's going home.</b>

38:11.982 --> 38:14.016
<b>Kevin, I do see artistry</b>
<b>in the fact</b>

38:14.017 --> 38:15.918
<b>that you came up</b>
<b>with something creatively</b>

38:15.919 --> 38:18.254
<b>and made your landmark</b>
<b>and made your little dude,</b>

38:18.255 --> 38:19.455
<b>and he's new-school.</b>

38:19.456 --> 38:20.923
<b>I see that as hitting</b>
<b>the challenge.</b>

38:20.924 --> 38:22.792
<b>Nikki, I don't see the monument.</b>

38:22.793 --> 38:24.427
<b>As far as I'm concerned,</b>
<b>Kevin is safe</b>

38:24.428 --> 38:26.028
<b>and it's between Nikki and Tito.</b>

38:26.029 --> 38:27.563
<b>- I kind of feel</b>
<b>that it's Nikki safe</b>

38:27.564 --> 38:29.465
<b>and it's between Tito and Kevin.</b>

38:29.466 --> 38:31.033
<b>- Well, this is your team.</b>

38:31.034 --> 38:33.369
<b>Who do you want to see stay</b>
<b>and who do you want to see go?</b>

38:33.370 --> 38:35.405
<b>- It comes down to this:</b>
<b>Tito, you and Kevin</b>

38:35.406 --> 38:37.273
<b>have the two lowest</b>
<b>report cards,</b>

38:37.274 --> 38:38.808
<b>and clearly</b>
<b>you're here again today.</b>

38:38.809 --> 38:41.144
<b>If these were the best two</b>
<b>drawings you guys could give</b>

38:41.145 --> 38:42.979
<b>to stay in this competition,</b>

38:42.980 --> 38:45.214
<b>then I don't see how you're</b>
<b>gonna go any further anyway.</b>

38:45.215 --> 38:47.550
<b>Seriously, you can't tell me</b>
<b>a little man on a stick</b>

38:47.551 --> 38:49.952
<b>with an unfinished background</b>
<b>is like,</b>

38:49.953 --> 38:52.455
<b>"Yo. I killed it. Drop the mic.</b>

38:52.456 --> 38:54.957
<b>Walk away. It's all good."</b>
<b>It's not.</b>

38:54.958 --> 38:56.592
<b>- No, I didn't say</b>
<b>I killed it at all.</b>

38:56.593 --> 38:58.094
<b>- Your goal</b>
<b>was to beat everybody</b>

38:58.095 --> 38:59.629
<b>and not to stand in this room.</b>

38:59.630 --> 39:01.264
<b>So was yours.</b>

39:01.265 --> 39:02.965
<b>- I need a final decision.</b>

39:02.966 --> 39:05.268
<b>- My decision is Tito.</b>

39:05.269 --> 39:06.636
<b>- Chris.</b>

39:06.637 --> 39:08.104
<b>- Tito.</b>

39:08.105 --> 39:10.973
<b>- My vote is also for Tito.</b>

39:10.974 --> 39:12.408
<b>The judges have decided.</b>

39:12.409 --> 39:16.679
<b>Tito, you do not have</b>
<b>what it takes to be Ink Master.</b>

39:16.680 --> 39:18.681
<b>- Tito, I think you're</b>
<b>a very competent tattooer.</b>

39:18.682 --> 39:20.950
<b>You definitely have what it</b>
<b>takes to do great tattoos</b>

39:20.951 --> 39:21.951
<b>in the real world.</b>

39:21.952 --> 39:23.453
<b>In this competition setting,</b>

39:23.454 --> 39:24.987
<b>it's a different beast</b>
<b>inside here.</b>

39:24.988 --> 39:27.558
<b>- Please pack your machines</b>
<b>and close shop.</b>

39:30.227 --> 39:32.528
<b> <i>- From day one,</i> </b>
<b> <i>you can see I'm a target.</i> </b>

39:32.529 --> 39:34.297
<b>You shoot me one time,</b>
<b>I'm stepping out.</b>

39:34.298 --> 39:36.132
<b>You shoot me two times,</b>
<b>I'm still stepping out.</b>

39:36.133 --> 39:38.601
<b>You shoot me three times</b>
<b>in my report card,</b>

39:38.602 --> 39:39.936
<b>it's gonna show.</b>

39:39.937 --> 39:42.439
<b>This game is tricky.</b>

39:46.243 --> 39:50.279
<b> <i>announcer: Still to come</b>

39:59.556 --> 40:01.724
<b> <i>- It's do or die.</i> </b>

40:01.725 --> 40:04.694
<b>I'm a lady tattooer</b>
<b>and I tattoo like a lady.</b>

40:04.695 --> 40:06.162

<b>right now?</b>

40:12.536 --> 40:14.137

<b> <i>- He's a [bleep] tattooer</i> </b>

<b>and he needs to get</b>
<b>the [bleep] out of here.</b>

40:21.478 --> 40:24.313
<b>for your canvas's head.</b>

40:24.314 --> 40:26.716

40:26.717 --> 40:28.184
<b>We got to start going</b>
<b>for heavy hitters.</b>

40:28.185 --> 40:29.919

<b>- Get rid of one of them.</b>

40:29.920 --> 40:31.988
<b>That's the ultimate way</b>
<b>to [bleep] with their emotions.</b>

40:31.989 --> 40:33.189
<b>- Just stir up some [bleep].</b>

<b>- Get inside</b>
<b>their [bleep] heads.</b>

40:34.391 --> 40:36.526
