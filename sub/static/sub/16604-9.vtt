in case Frank shows up.

20:20.213 --> 20:21.713
Where you gonna sleep?

20:21.714 --> 20:24.583
I'll find someplace.

20:24.584 --> 20:26.084
You can crash with us tonight.

20:26.085 --> 20:28.520
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:28.521 --> 20:32.324
Aw, Deb. You're a doll.

20:32.325 --> 20:33.558
Thanks.

20:33.559 --> 20:36.194
Can you take my duffel too?

20:36.195 --> 20:37.729
Sure.

20:37.730 --> 20:39.331
Here's our address.

20:39.332 --> 20:41.099
Our key's under the mat.

20:41.100 --> 20:42.901
We're unit one.

20:42.902 --> 20:44.536
Thank you so...

20:44.537 --> 20:46.938
And thank you
for making me a grandmother.

20:46.939 --> 20:50.976
I haven't been this happy
since the summer you were born.

20:50.977 --> 20:54.212
Winter. My birthday's in December.

20:54.213 --> 20:56.114
See you later.

20:56.115 --> 20:58.884
I'm a motherfucking grandma!

20:58.885 --> 21:00.620
- Whoo!
- (MONICA) Thank you.

21:02.021 --> 21:04.222
I got to freshen up for Frank.

21:04.223 --> 21:06.057
Show him I still got it.

21:06.058 --> 21:08.059
Got what? Crabs or herpes?

21:08.060 --> 21:11.463
- So, I talked to Kev.
- And?

21:11.464 --> 21:14.166
He thinks we should go see
a throuples counselor.

21:14.167 --> 21:16.001
I said I'd talk to you about it.

21:16.002 --> 21:18.970
Hey, yo, V, can I get
whatever's cheap and ugly?

21:18.971 --> 21:20.839
Maybe we can go once?

21:20.840 --> 21:23.041
If we hate it,
we don't have to go again.

21:23.042 --> 21:24.376
- Okay.
- Really?

21:24.377 --> 21:26.344
We go to throuple counsel.

21:26.345 --> 21:28.980
We go and sit in front
of old man with shit breath.

21:28.981 --> 21:30.382
Talk about fucking. He takes notes.

21:30.383 --> 21:32.818
He goes home and spanks his monkey.

21:32.819 --> 21:34.987
If you both want this, I do it for you.

21:37.723 --> 21:38.757
His drink's on me!

21:38.758 --> 21:40.492
No, no, I got my own drink.

21:40.493 --> 21:42.327
- Monica?
- Hey, V.

21:42.328 --> 21:44.729
Last ball, I got side-titty.

21:44.730 --> 21:46.164
Boom!

21:46.165 --> 21:47.866
Who is this spastic woman?

21:47.867 --> 21:49.501
Frank's wife. The kids' mother.

21:49.502 --> 21:50.502
Kids have a mother?

21:50.503 --> 21:51.937
(VERONICA) Barely.

21:51.938 --> 21:53.705
You gonna tell us
where you've been, Monica?

21:53.706 --> 21:54.940

21:54.941 --> 21:57.209
Some Shitsville roadhouse off the 80.

21:58.811 --> 22:01.546
More guns than teeth in that place.

22:01.547 --> 22:05.550
Once, I saw a guy
skin a buck in the parking lot

22:05.551 --> 22:07.152
with a rock and a rope.

22:07.153 --> 22:10.055
Wow, civility is alive and well.

22:10.056 --> 22:11.723
So, what brings you back to town?

22:11.724 --> 22:13.625
Frank and the kids.

22:13.626 --> 22:15.227
I'm gonna make good.

22:15.228 --> 22:16.628
You hear that, Lip?

22:16.629 --> 22:18.730
I got a plan.

22:18.731 --> 22:20.966
I'm gonna set
you and the kids up for life.

23:33.372 --> 23:34.839
What, Monica showed up?

23:34.840 --> 23:35.874
I didn't ditch anyone.

23:35.875 --> 23:37.409
She left of her own free will.

27:54.441 --> 27:55.975

not with Monica in town.

Yeah.

I mean, what if I say stuff
I don't want people to know?

29:13.320 --> 29:15.321
They can't force you
to say anything embarrassing.

29:15.322 --> 29:18.357
Yeah, but don't these dudes
have, like, powers?

29:18.358 --> 29:19.792
Do you mean like Aquaman?

29:19.793 --> 29:21.794
No, man. Not superpowers.

29:21.795 --> 29:23.796
They, like, look at you
in a certain way,

29:23.797 --> 29:26.165

a memory of your foster mother

29:26.166 --> 29:28.000

with a toothbrush

29:28.001 --> 29:29.669

29:42.916 --> 29:45.918
"Hey, you blew it. Throw in the towel."

a crack in your shell.
