(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:59.500 --> 01:04.416
It's him, everywhere the same
since the beginning of time,

01:04.416 --> 01:07.458
Apocalypse,
the bringer of chaos,

01:07.458 --> 01:09.208
the destroyer of worlds.

01:11.458 --> 01:13.416
Careful!
This one could be the key!

01:13.416 --> 01:16.833
Right!
Just like all the others.

01:16.833 --> 01:19.708
I don't pay you to jabber!
What does it say?

01:31.000 --> 01:31.875
ARCHANGEL: It's him.

01:34.750 --> 01:40.083
Let's see.
"And lo, he leveled our city,

01:40.083 --> 01:43.458
and laid waste our fields,

01:43.458 --> 01:47.875
Lord of destruction,
the Invincible One."

01:47.875 --> 01:50.083
He is not invincible!

01:50.083 --> 01:55.250
I'm sorry, Mr. Worthington,
but we've looked through
all the evidence.

01:55.250 --> 01:57.000
People may have
drawn him differently,

01:57.000 --> 01:59.208
but they all agree
on one thing.

01:59.208 --> 02:02.416
Apocalypse can't be destroyed.

02:02.416 --> 02:04.208
I won't accept it!

02:04.208 --> 02:06.625
It's your dollar,
sir, but we're beat.

02:06.625 --> 02:08.875
We'll check the rest
of the new crates
in the morning.

02:09.958 --> 02:11.250
(SCREAMS)

02:11.250 --> 02:14.583
No one rests until
he is destroyed.

02:16.291 --> 02:18.583
You're late!

02:18.583 --> 02:21.958
I'm sorry, Mr. Worthington,
but I found the scroll
you read about!

02:21.958 --> 02:23.000
Show me!

02:23.708 --> 02:26.875
The scroll was unearthed during
the Ming Dynasty,

02:26.875 --> 02:28.583
though it is far older.

02:28.583 --> 02:31.000
There is a spot, here.

02:31.458 --> 02:36.750
The writing says
that if you pierce it,
Apocalypse will be no more.

02:36.750 --> 02:39.750
Vengeance will be mine.

02:39.750 --> 02:41.833
MAN: Sir! A definite sighting!

02:41.833 --> 02:43.458
Where?

02:43.458 --> 02:45.958
New York Harbor.
They say within the last hour.

02:45.958 --> 02:47.583
That's the closest he's--

02:59.416 --> 03:03.208

CEREBRO: New Shi'ar circuitry

03:14.375 --> 03:16.875
has helped me detect
and define
a mysterious vessel.

03:16.875 --> 03:20.833
It is more than a mile long,
and disappears soon after
detection.

03:20.833 --> 03:23.458
How do you hide
something a mile long?

03:23.458 --> 03:25.833
Who knows, deep pockets?

03:34.625 --> 03:36.583

Return to me, oh,
sweet Death, my Horseman,
and all shall be forgiven.

03:54.125 --> 03:56.583
Forgiven? You ruined my life!

03:56.583 --> 04:02.250
Ruined? No. I have created
a slave of you, yes,

04:02.250 --> 04:04.291
but a slave of
courage and fire!

04:04.291 --> 04:06.333
I am no slave!

04:08.875 --> 04:11.333
There exists no
freedom from me.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.875
Like lambs to the slaughter.

04:21.583 --> 04:22.708
(SCREAMS)

04:24.958 --> 04:26.458
That ain't playing nice.

04:46.875 --> 04:49.875
My mother always
wanted me to be a surgeon.

04:49.875 --> 04:51.875
Foolish insects!

05:05.625 --> 05:07.416
We must out think him.

05:07.416 --> 05:09.708
Why bother?
We can't even scratch him!

05:17.166 --> 05:18.458
Warren...

05:18.458 --> 05:20.625
He's not Warren anymore, chere.

05:20.625 --> 05:22.958
Apocalypse machine make

05:22.958 --> 05:26.000
him L'ange de mort,
the Angel of Death,

05:26.000 --> 05:28.166
now and forever.

05:28.166 --> 05:31.875
You're wrong. Before, when
I absorbed his spirit,
I could feel it.

05:31.875 --> 05:34.625
Whatever he's going through,
deep down,

05:34.625 --> 05:36.500
he is still Warren Worthington!

05:37.458 --> 05:41.125
Look closely.
Apocalypse has attacked
a power station here,

05:41.125 --> 05:45.333
a defense plant here,
an industrial park here.

05:45.333 --> 05:48.125
It appears to be
a deliberate trail.

05:48.125 --> 05:49.958
Or a deliberate trap.

05:49.958 --> 05:51.583
Let's project it out.

WOLVERINE: His ship.
That's a heck of a bass boat.

06:04.375 --> 06:08.583
Early Apocalyptic scholars
referred to, and I quote,

06:08.583 --> 06:12.500
"A mighty ship designed
by creatures from
beyond the stars."

06:14.708 --> 06:17.458
For centuries, it was thought
to be a myth,

06:17.458 --> 06:19.875
a living vessel,
open to reason.

06:19.875 --> 06:24.000
That's it! The weapon
we need against
"He who can never die."

06:27.458 --> 06:30.333
Warren, how could you go
after him like that?

06:34.291 --> 06:38.583
No pain will ever equal
the pain Apocalypse
has caused me.

06:38.583 --> 06:41.166
You should understand that
better than anyone.

06:41.166 --> 06:44.625
It is time to welcome death,
X-Men.

06:45.708 --> 06:47.833
Let's see if I can't
improve your disposition.

06:47.833 --> 06:51.166
(SCREAMING) No! No!

06:57.333 --> 07:00.708
You're right. Part of you is
part of me now.

07:00.708 --> 07:05.583
You may have saved me,
but nothing can take away
my desire for revenge.

07:05.583 --> 07:09.958
But Apocalypse, he's immortal.
No one can hurt him.

07:09.958 --> 07:12.125
That what he wants us
to believe.

07:12.125 --> 07:14.416
But I have discovered
his weakness!

07:14.416 --> 07:17.708
You and I can
attack him together.

07:17.708 --> 07:20.625
The others don't
understand. You do.

07:20.625 --> 07:23.250
I don't know...
I want to help, but...

07:23.250 --> 07:26.083
Rogue. We've found
his ship. Come on.
We don't have much time!

07:26.083 --> 07:27.250
Where did he run?

07:27.250 --> 07:29.375
A heading south by southeast.

07:29.375 --> 07:32.708
However, we have chosen
an indirect attack stratagem.

07:32.708 --> 07:35.166
I have no patience for
playing at war games!

07:35.958 --> 07:38.208
No one understands
what must be done!

07:39.416 --> 07:42.166
I must see him destroyed!

07:43.416 --> 07:44.750
And I'm coming with you.

07:44.750 --> 07:46.333
GAMBIT: No, chere!Don't.

07:46.333 --> 07:49.000
He can't fight that
monster by himself!

07:49.000 --> 07:52.458
Revenge make him reckless.
He take you down with him.

07:52.458 --> 07:54.583
Gambit's right.

07:54.583 --> 07:56.583
We'll need all the help
we can get if Hank's
plan is gonna work.

07:56.583 --> 07:59.625
Sorry, boys. You don't know
what he's been through.

07:59.625 --> 08:01.458
I do. I got to help him.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.500
I wouldn't mind a little direct
action myself.

08:06.500 --> 08:10.333

It is sentient!

08:22.875 --> 08:26.000
We can speak to it.
We are friends.

of my programming.

09:06.833 --> 09:09.750
Now, where should I start?

09:11.291 --> 09:14.750
If I can just override
Apocalypse's security code,

09:14.750 --> 09:20.583
we can turn it against him,
using his own magnificent
weapon to entrap him.

09:28.583 --> 09:31.291

09:31.291 --> 09:33.625
For which we are
exceedingly thankful.

Cool.
But I ain't saying cheese.

09:48.208 --> 09:52.250
OK, my friend,
now walk toward me,
slowly at first.

09:52.250 --> 09:56.166
Every unit of energy
the captive exerts
works against him.

09:56.166 --> 09:59.500
Apocalypse's own power
will create his prison.

09:59.500 --> 10:01.416
Hank, you've done it!

10:01.416 --> 10:03.708
No, we've done it.

15:21.250 --> 15:24.583
He has preset this
override system.

15:24.583 --> 15:29.000
I will study it,
but I fear I will be
of little help to you.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.500
Behold your proof.

15:32.750 --> 15:34.333
No.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.416
I knew the temptation
would flush you out,

15:38.416 --> 15:43.708
because you, heart,
body, soul, are mine!

15:43.708 --> 15:47.875
I am the rocks of
the eternal shore,

15:47.875 --> 15:52.125
crash against me and be broken!

15:54.166 --> 15:57.833
The name is Gambit!
Remember it!

15:58.375 --> 16:02.958
Fools! You are slow to learn.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.958
SHIP: Henry McCoy,
the emergency controls.

16:07.958 --> 16:09.000
Where?

16:11.291 --> 16:12.375
(GRUNTS)

16:15.000 --> 16:16.458
(GAMBIT GROANING)

16:17.708 --> 16:20.958
Chere,maybe you
cut down on that
fried chicken, huh?

16:28.250 --> 16:30.458
Ship, help me?

16:30.458 --> 16:33.458
SHIP: I will try.

16:45.458 --> 16:48.416
There exists no
freedom from me.

16:48.416 --> 16:50.750
There is only
freedom through me.

16:50.750 --> 16:53.375
I'll show you what's
"through you."

16:54.708 --> 16:56.333
(EVIL LAUGHTER)

17:04.708 --> 17:06.458
Thank you, my friend.

17:06.458 --> 17:09.875
APOCALYPSE: Submit!
Come, cleave unto me!

17:09.875 --> 17:13.000
And know the joy
of eternal darkness.

17:16.458 --> 17:21.125
Ah... little blue man,
so you think you
have outsmarted me?

17:21.125 --> 17:24.458
There shall be naught to help,
but ashes.

17:31.625 --> 17:34.250
Ship! I have not
commanded you to...

17:34.250 --> 17:35.583
(GROANS)

17:38.416 --> 17:41.458
Beast, what in the Sam Hill
is going on?

17:41.458 --> 17:45.375
It appears an override
may be overridden.

17:45.375 --> 17:48.291
You defeated Apocalypse's
override code?

17:48.291 --> 17:50.583
No, a friend did.

17:50.583 --> 17:53.000
APOCALYPSE: Traitorous vessel!

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
SHIP: For so long, I did
only as I was programmed.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.458
I thank you for
this moment, Beast.

18:00.458 --> 18:03.875
You made me understand
I could choose.

18:03.875 --> 18:05.000
(SHIP GROANING)

18:05.000 --> 18:06.833
You made me feel.

18:13.500 --> 18:16.708
You helped me know
what I had to do.

18:27.708 --> 18:28.500
No.

18:37.708 --> 18:40.583
Ship, I am losing my friends!

18:40.583 --> 18:46.458
SHIP: Apologies, Beast.
I have not much energy left.

18:48.875 --> 18:50.125
Many thanks, mes amis.

18:50.125 --> 18:52.208
CYCLOPS: Everybody out of here!

18:52.708 --> 18:55.458
Apocalypse is eternal!

18:55.458 --> 18:58.583
Apocalypse is indestructible!

18:58.583 --> 19:01.583
Foolish insects!

19:01.583 --> 19:03.333
Impudent vermin!

19:18.708 --> 19:24.333
I shall return.

19:26.458 --> 19:30.125
Ship? Ship, are you all right?

19:30.125 --> 19:33.583
SHIP: It was the best
I could manage, Beast.

19:33.583 --> 19:36.750
He will not be gone forever.

19:36.750 --> 19:41.125
But for now, you and your
people are safe.

19:41.583 --> 19:46.875
When he returns,
I will be here, waiting.

19:46.875 --> 19:48.625
Next time you can wait alone.

19:48.625 --> 19:51.875
Your unthinking vengeance
nearly destroyed all of us.

19:51.875 --> 19:54.500
You don't understand!
Any of you!

19:54.500 --> 19:57.875
Don't you know what
he is? Don't you know
what he'll do?

19:57.875 --> 20:00.833
Easy, sugar. There's
nothing more to be
done right now...

20:00.833 --> 20:04.291
Stay away!
I thought you understood!

20:04.291 --> 20:07.708
I won't rest until
Apocalypse is destroyed!

20:08.708 --> 20:09.708
Or I am.

20:14.000 --> 20:19.250
Beast, it's my fault.
I should have stopped
Archangel.

20:19.250 --> 20:23.125
Gambit warned me,
but I didn't listen to him.

20:23.125 --> 20:25.750
I'm sorry. Beast?

20:25.750 --> 20:27.375
SHIP: Goodbye, my friend.

20:38.833 --> 20:40.333
Farewell, my friend.

20:52.291 --> 20:53.625
