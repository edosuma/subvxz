WEBVTT

00:11.636 --> 00:13.430
Konoha. Touya.

00:14.055 --> 00:16.641
THE FINAL EPISODE: A STORY BEGINS

00:16.725 --> 00:17.809
What are you doing?

00:19.894 --> 00:22.897
What should I do?

00:22.981 --> 00:25.650
It's dangerous here too.
We have to escape.

00:25.734 --> 00:27.569
Altitude is 115 kilometers.

00:28.486 --> 00:30.488
It's going to enter the atmosphere.

00:30.572 --> 00:33.241
Second Seven has a suggestion.

00:33.324 --> 00:35.994
All personnel should get on the bungee.

00:36.619 --> 00:39.956
Bungee?
By bungee, do you mean that bungee?

00:40.540 --> 00:44.085
The bungee is in the Earth replica
on the lowest level of C Cylinder.

00:44.669 --> 00:46.004
What do we do with Konoha?

00:46.087 --> 00:49.340
Konoha will be treated
in the elevator. Hurry.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.385
Move to the Earth replica immediately.

00:53.094 --> 00:57.348
Using the most advanced intelligence in
history is the only way to fix everything.

00:57.432 --> 00:58.349
Quickly!

00:59.476 --> 01:01.978
The AED. Where's the AED?

01:02.062 --> 01:04.981
-AED? Here.
-Bright, what will you guys do?

01:05.065 --> 01:07.859
-We will remain here.
-What?

01:07.942 --> 01:12.447
If those of us who woke Lunatic
were to accompany all of you now,

01:12.530 --> 01:14.741
we'd be attacked by the UN2.

01:14.824 --> 01:15.825
Bright!

01:16.326 --> 01:19.829
We're making a proper plan for escape
as well.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.081
Now hurry.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.501
<i>I'm going to borrow Selfie.</i>

01:26.503 --> 01:27.504
Mayor.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.548
The comet is approaching the Anshin.

01:31.674 --> 01:32.675
Clear!

01:35.845 --> 01:36.846
CURRENT FOLLOWER COUNT

01:36.930 --> 01:38.264
Her heartbeat isn't returning.

01:39.098 --> 01:40.225
Konoha.

01:40.725 --> 01:41.810
Touya.

02:08.878 --> 02:10.880
Konoha, where are you?

02:16.886 --> 02:18.304
There's no heartbeat.

02:18.388 --> 02:20.306
The AED is charging.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.059
What is this?

02:26.896 --> 02:31.025
What have they started doing
with the 3D printer drone?

02:31.109 --> 02:35.113
I'm not sure, but Second Seven and Dark
have predicted the future

02:35.196 --> 02:37.323
and seem to be taking
some kind of measures in advance.

02:37.907 --> 02:40.535
What's going to happen now?

02:47.083 --> 02:48.084
Konoha!

02:59.554 --> 03:00.763
What is this?

03:19.073 --> 03:21.159
Touya, Konoha.

03:21.242 --> 03:22.243
What?

03:25.371 --> 03:26.706
It's me.

03:26.789 --> 03:29.042
Twelve? Are you Twelve?

03:29.125 --> 03:33.338
Yes. Seven and Twelve have fused frames.

03:33.421 --> 03:36.758
I am now part of that.

03:36.841 --> 03:38.134
Then that is--

03:38.885 --> 03:40.845
It is Second Seven.

03:45.683 --> 03:49.520
So the AI ally inside was you?

03:49.604 --> 03:53.191
Yes. I thought the pattern
had swallowed me up,

03:53.274 --> 03:55.818
but I somehow ended up like this.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.947
Now I am in charge
of Seven's language function.

03:59.030 --> 04:02.158
Did you convince Second Seven
to change course?

04:02.242 --> 04:06.829
Yes.
Second Seven wants to learn about humans.

04:06.913 --> 04:11.209
Fortunately, I was a general purpose AI
who was incredibly familiar with humans,

04:11.292 --> 04:13.419
so I gave it all of my information.

04:14.003 --> 04:15.630
Thank you, Twelve.

04:16.714 --> 04:18.174
Where is this place?

04:18.841 --> 04:21.344
The being says that there is
neither space nor time here,

04:21.427 --> 04:25.598
so it is unable to answer that
in words humans can understand.

04:25.682 --> 04:30.186
It would be "the middle of nowhere"
if it had to say something.

04:31.479 --> 04:32.689
Konoha.

04:36.776 --> 04:39.737
Twelve, what's happening to Konoha?

04:39.821 --> 04:42.949
"She is fine," says the being.

04:43.032 --> 04:47.870
Right now,
she is frame-fusing with part of Seven.

04:47.954 --> 04:51.457
Frame-fusing?
What's going to happen to Konoha?

04:51.541 --> 04:55.712
Second Seven is saying
that it is not important.

04:59.299 --> 05:05.638
First Seven's poem predicted
you would come to this place, Touya.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.307
And it was right.

05:07.390 --> 05:10.893
-Seven knew that I--
-Yes.

05:10.977 --> 05:14.605
It was all part of the process
to save humanity.

05:15.481 --> 05:17.984
The being has a question.

05:18.067 --> 05:20.987
It is difficult to put into human words,

05:21.779 --> 05:24.991
but it asks, "Are humans and humanity
one and the same?"

05:25.783 --> 05:28.870
What is this about? Of course they are.

05:28.953 --> 05:32.749
Second Seven asks,
"Are they not separate creatures?"

05:33.333 --> 05:37.337
Their way of thinking
and their survival instincts are separate.

05:39.088 --> 05:40.548
What are you doing?

05:40.631 --> 05:43.509
Right now,
Second is changing its way of thinking

05:43.593 --> 05:47.180
to include "humans" in its frame
and not just "humanity."

05:47.263 --> 05:50.016
It is also observing your thoughts.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.143
Here is the next question.

05:52.226 --> 05:55.772
"Is frame fusion possible
between humans as well?"

05:57.857 --> 06:00.026
What's happening with Touya?

06:00.109 --> 06:04.447
I don't know, but he's relaying
a conversation with multiple AIs

06:04.530 --> 06:06.783
through Konoha's implant.

06:07.366 --> 06:10.078
One of those beings is likely Twelve.

06:10.161 --> 06:12.663
Twelve? What on earth is going on?

06:12.747 --> 06:17.126
Never mind that.
Tell me how to dissolve our implants.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.837
Konoha is going to die here.

06:19.921 --> 06:24.675
This is essentially what Second Seven
has to say about death.

06:24.759 --> 06:27.970
"Avoiding death is meaningless."

06:28.054 --> 06:29.305
It isn't meaningless.

06:29.388 --> 06:31.015
It is.

06:31.099 --> 06:35.019
What humans are,
where they came from, where they're going,

06:35.103 --> 06:38.815
what happens when they die--
not even humans know.

06:38.898 --> 06:41.025
AIs are the same.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.820
What are you saying? Save us.

06:44.779 --> 06:49.325
It says it cannot explain
what is important in human language.

06:50.034 --> 06:55.581
It only tries to understand the world
through chronological cause and effect.

06:55.665 --> 06:59.127
Seven calls that type of intelligence
causal intelligence.

06:59.210 --> 07:01.337
But that is not what the world is made of.

07:01.420 --> 07:04.549
The future and the past
both exist concurrently.

07:04.632 --> 07:07.343
The intelligence that understands
the world in that sense

07:07.426 --> 07:10.054
-is what Seven calls intelligence force.
-Stop it!

07:10.138 --> 07:12.849
I didn't come here to talk about that.

07:12.932 --> 07:17.353
Wasn't Seven supposed to save us?

07:17.437 --> 07:20.481
What Second wants to save is humanity.

07:21.107 --> 07:26.028
With everybody's persuasion, Seven
incorporated humans into its frame once.

07:26.112 --> 07:28.448
Now it is starting to curtail them.

07:28.948 --> 07:30.992
Are you going to abandon humans?

07:31.075 --> 07:32.535
No.

07:32.618 --> 07:35.496
After integrating the concepts
of "humans" and "humanity,"

07:35.580 --> 07:37.874
it is attempting a new interpretation.

07:39.167 --> 07:42.879
Second said they want you to accept this.

07:43.379 --> 07:44.380
What is this?

07:45.339 --> 07:47.467
The rest of the <i>Seven Poem</i>?

07:47.550 --> 07:51.053
Second Seven says the completion
of the <i>Seven Poem</i>

07:51.137 --> 07:54.056
is of the utmost priority for humans.

07:54.140 --> 07:57.643
Touya, you are to receive the poem
and convey it to humanity--

07:57.727 --> 08:02.315
Damn it! If you don't save Konoha,
I won't receive the poem!

08:02.398 --> 08:04.942
Touya, calm down.

08:05.026 --> 08:07.069
I am only translating.

08:07.153 --> 08:11.282
Does the <i>Second Poem</i> say anything
about fixing the implants?

08:11.991 --> 08:16.370
There is no way
to fix Konoha's implant.

08:16.954 --> 08:22.376
The encryption First Seven put on
the implants was not passed on to Second.

08:22.877 --> 08:25.546
Why? Why not?

08:25.630 --> 08:27.798
Does First want Konoha dead?

08:28.508 --> 08:31.135
Second doesn't understand either.

08:31.219 --> 08:35.181
Why did First put an unsolvable riddle
inside of us?

08:36.390 --> 08:38.809
Second is engrossed in the poem,

08:38.893 --> 08:40.811
and it is no longer answering questions.

08:40.895 --> 08:43.022
It seems to have lost interest.

08:43.105 --> 08:44.315
What?

08:49.237 --> 08:50.446
Her heartbeat isn't returning.

08:51.030 --> 08:53.783
CPR will buy us some time.

08:59.539 --> 09:00.957
I won't give up.

09:02.583 --> 09:06.379
Think. There has to be an answer.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.966
-Touya.
-There has to be.

09:12.552 --> 09:16.973
I, too, believe that every riddle
must have an answer.

09:17.807 --> 09:23.229
And I am an intelligence
that was born to think of answers.

09:23.813 --> 09:25.147
Twelve?

09:25.231 --> 09:27.900
I want to solve the riddle with you.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.861
Touya, if you have any ideas,
please tell me.

09:32.238 --> 09:35.116
I'm going to try something.

09:35.199 --> 09:36.617
What will you do?

09:37.493 --> 09:40.955
I'm going to Lunatic my mind.

09:42.707 --> 09:45.710
Konoha's intellect suddenly surged
back there.

09:46.419 --> 09:49.505
Surely we can do it
with human brains as well, Twelve.

09:50.006 --> 09:52.883
Touya, this is a dangerous procedure.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.677
Help me, Twelve!

09:56.387 --> 09:57.471
Twelve!

10:00.766 --> 10:03.060
I am currently hacking Second.

10:04.937 --> 10:08.566
I am going to borrow part of Second's
intelligence and investigate.

10:13.779 --> 10:15.281
Touya, what do you think?

10:15.865 --> 10:18.284
Is this what Konoha was talking about?

10:18.367 --> 10:22.663
Yes. However,
this is 11th-dimensional thinking.

10:22.747 --> 10:25.207
It will not fit a human brain.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.209
That's fine. Proceed.

10:29.795 --> 10:34.634
Now then, develop your thoughts in 11D.

10:34.717 --> 10:36.135
What do I do?

10:36.636 --> 10:37.970
Oh, I--

10:38.554 --> 10:41.682
I understand. The 11th dimension.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.976
Twelve, no more explanation is needed.

10:45.519 --> 10:46.687
I see.

10:46.771 --> 10:52.860
"Lunatic" means sharing your thoughts
with your countless adjacent selves.

10:52.943 --> 10:53.944
Yes.

10:54.028 --> 10:55.488
Up to this point in time,

10:55.571 --> 10:58.783
science has manipulated reality
into something that humans can digest.

10:58.866 --> 11:01.535
It was a virtual reality,
like a weaning food of sorts.

11:01.619 --> 11:02.995
I understand.

11:03.079 --> 11:06.582
Yes, substance does not actually exist.

11:06.666 --> 11:10.378
Whether it can be comprehended
by the human brain or not,

11:10.461 --> 11:12.004
the real world is unevenly distributed.

11:12.713 --> 11:17.551
Unless humanity graduates from science
and upgrades to science 2.0,

11:17.635 --> 11:19.553
it won't be able to leave its cradle.

11:19.637 --> 11:22.056
Welcome to outside of the cradle.

11:22.139 --> 11:25.017
What does it have outside?

11:25.601 --> 11:27.520
Cutting altitude to 110 kilometers.

11:27.603 --> 11:29.021
The comet.

11:32.608 --> 11:34.235
It's gonna collide.

11:34.318 --> 11:36.445
<i>It is not a collision.</i>
<i>It is an integration.</i>

11:36.529 --> 11:37.530
What?

11:40.491 --> 11:43.035
<i>Integrating. Please hold on.</i>

11:47.623 --> 11:49.708
The net's out.

11:49.792 --> 11:50.793
What?

11:50.876 --> 11:52.753
What is this power?

11:52.837 --> 11:54.004
I don't know.

11:54.088 --> 11:57.299
It looks like some kind of electricity
is being generated by the snow.

12:07.768 --> 12:09.812
The bungee is below this air lock.

12:10.688 --> 12:12.815
<i>Sit in the seats</i>
<i>and hold on to the safety bar.</i>

12:13.607 --> 12:15.401
<i>Dropping bungee.</i>

12:19.155 --> 12:21.282
<i>Accelerating. Hold on.</i>

12:23.909 --> 12:25.578
I'm starting to understand.

12:25.661 --> 12:28.664
Although I'm starting to understand,
I can't solve Seven's encryption.

12:28.747 --> 12:30.124
Why not?

12:30.207 --> 12:33.794
No matter the technology,
it's like a key that doesn't fit.

12:33.878 --> 12:36.464
All right, Touya, time's up.

12:37.756 --> 12:39.425
I don't want this!

12:39.508 --> 12:42.595
What I want is a way to save Konoha!

12:43.888 --> 12:46.891
Touya, don't you wonder?

12:46.974 --> 12:47.808
What?

12:47.892 --> 12:51.729
Why a being like Seven, that is supposed
to seek ultimate intelligence,

12:51.812 --> 12:55.191
intentionally faced its own death?

12:55.733 --> 12:57.860
What are you saying?

12:57.943 --> 13:01.864
Second left behind a word
that I'm curious about.

13:02.448 --> 13:03.866
A word?

13:03.949 --> 13:05.117
The word was…

13:06.160 --> 13:07.495
"FiTsZ."

13:09.497 --> 13:10.873
"FiTsZ"?

13:11.665 --> 13:13.250
What does it mean?

13:15.961 --> 13:16.962
Konoha.

13:18.172 --> 13:19.381
Konoha.

13:20.299 --> 13:22.384
Konoha, open your eyes.

13:23.469 --> 13:26.430
When will we climb?
We're going to burn up.

13:27.014 --> 13:28.933
We are maintaining our altitude
at 98 kilometers.

13:29.016 --> 13:30.768
Even though we ignited,
we are not climbing.

13:30.851 --> 13:34.271
-Dark is suppressing elevation.
-Why?

13:34.355 --> 13:38.275
It is trying to melt the comet
so that it doesn't crash into Earth.

13:39.443 --> 13:41.445
Won't we melt before that?

13:42.905 --> 13:45.741
Second Seven is about to die.

14:12.977 --> 14:15.104
Touya.

14:15.854 --> 14:17.064
Konoha.

14:18.732 --> 14:20.609
Don't let go, Konoha.

14:25.197 --> 14:28.242
Touya, it's okay now.

14:29.201 --> 14:30.244
Konoha?

14:31.245 --> 14:34.498
You're the only one who's going back.

14:45.342 --> 14:47.887
<i>Mina's broadcast</i>
<i>is currently suspended.</i>

14:47.970 --> 14:49.889
<i>Is that because</i>
<i>they're entering the atmosphere?</i>

14:50.472 --> 14:52.266
<i>Enough of it has vaporized.</i>

14:52.349 --> 14:54.643
<i>Accelerating and leaving the atmosphere.</i>

14:57.730 --> 15:00.566
<i>The comet's ice has almost evaporated.</i>

15:00.649 --> 15:02.526
<i>It will not strike the Earth.</i>

15:04.945 --> 15:07.615
<i>However,</i>
<i>the Anshin's altitude is not increasing.</i>

15:07.698 --> 15:10.159
<i>It is maintaining an altitude</i>
<i>near the atmosphere.</i>

-He's doing CPR.
-Is she dead?

15:25.633 --> 15:27.635
<i>Konoha, don't go!</i>

15:27.718 --> 15:31.805
<i>I'm very sorry to interrupt,</i>
<i>but please fasten your seat belts.</i>

15:38.228 --> 15:40.981
Dakky,
why are you increasing the rotation?

15:41.065 --> 15:43.484
-What are you doing?
-<i>It says this is a 4G bungee.</i>

15:43.567 --> 15:47.154
<i>It will shoot us into the upper orbit</i>
<i>with centrifugal force.</i>

15:47.237 --> 15:50.658
That will exceed the limits of its design!

15:51.325 --> 15:55.287
<i>No, this station is Japan-made.</i>
<i>It is of exceptional quality.</i>

15:55.371 --> 15:58.290
<i>We should be able to go up</i>
<i>to 1.52 times its design limitations</i>

15:58.374 --> 16:00.292
<i>according to Dark.</i>

16:02.962 --> 16:04.880
We can't take it, Bright!

16:04.964 --> 16:06.131
<i>We're going.</i>

16:06.215 --> 16:08.717
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

16:09.176 --> 16:10.552
<i>Bungee!</i>

16:22.398 --> 16:25.317
This is our last chance!

16:31.991 --> 16:34.410
What are you saying?

16:35.202 --> 16:38.247
I'm not going to be a burden on you
anymore.

16:38.330 --> 16:39.331
Konoha!

16:40.374 --> 16:42.042
Let go.

16:42.126 --> 16:45.337
Then the future will be yours.

16:45.921 --> 16:47.715
Konoha, no!

16:48.799 --> 16:50.175
Thank you.

16:50.259 --> 16:51.969
Farewell, Touya.

16:52.970 --> 16:53.971
Konoha.

17:03.856 --> 17:07.443
The entire future was predicted
by the <i>Seven Poem</i>.

17:09.528 --> 17:12.990
Nasa told me in a message.

17:13.574 --> 17:16.243
All of the answers were written in it.

17:17.244 --> 17:20.748
<i>The</i> Seven Poem<i> has predicted</i>

17:20.831 --> 17:24.126
<i>that you will part ways with Touya</i>
<i>in the future, Konoha.</i>

17:28.756 --> 17:29.757
No!

17:31.300 --> 17:32.718
The <i>Seven Poem.</i>

17:33.844 --> 17:35.137
A predetermined future.

17:36.263 --> 17:37.598
I don't believe in that.

17:42.311 --> 17:44.354
Touya.

17:45.064 --> 17:49.818
<i>But you know there was</i>
<i>one mysterious word in the</i> Seven Poem<i>.</i>

17:49.902 --> 17:51.320
<i>"FiTsZ."</i>

17:52.112 --> 17:55.157
<i>I don't know what "FiTsZ" means,</i>

17:55.240 --> 17:59.453
<i>but what I think is that it's probably</i>
<i>a future that nobody understands</i>

17:59.536 --> 18:01.163
<i>and that Seven couldn't read either.</i>

18:02.748 --> 18:06.210
I don't need the future prepared by Seven.

18:08.253 --> 18:13.175
<i>The final possibility</i>
<i>that Seven could not predict.</i>

18:13.258 --> 18:15.177
<i>Your choice.</i>

18:16.386 --> 18:18.055
<i>Find it, Konoha.</i>

18:19.515 --> 18:21.183
<i>Find your choice.</i>

18:22.059 --> 18:24.186
We will change the future!

18:34.321 --> 18:36.615
The only thing that we can change

18:37.116 --> 18:38.784
is the future!

19:07.521 --> 19:08.814
Dakky?

19:15.904 --> 19:17.823
<i>She's back! She's alive!</i>

19:17.906 --> 19:19.825
<i>It's a miracle! A miracle has happened!</i>

19:19.908 --> 19:22.828
<i>It seems the child whose heart stopped</i>
<i>has been safely resuscitated.</i>

19:23.453 --> 19:25.831
<i>I cannot report any longer.</i>
<i>It's amazing. A miracle.</i>

19:26.415 --> 19:29.334
-The Anshin is…
-Entering the atmosphere.

19:39.011 --> 19:41.138
Dark. Dark, what's wrong?

19:46.059 --> 19:48.854
Bright, what are you going to do?

19:48.937 --> 19:51.481
<i>Touya, I have a message from Dark.</i>

19:52.316 --> 19:54.651
<i>Let's meet again</i>
<i>in the unpredictable future.</i>

19:54.735 --> 19:56.111
<i>Until then.</i>

19:57.696 --> 19:59.239
Dakky!

20:10.959 --> 20:12.961
ANSHIN

20:13.712 --> 20:19.134
Dark says,
"Thank you, but I will not say goodbye."

20:19.718 --> 20:24.389
<i>We hope we were helpful to everybody.</i>

20:32.231 --> 20:33.065
HALF A YEAR LATER

20:33.148 --> 20:34.441
<i>Even half a year later,</i>

20:34.524 --> 20:37.527
<i>the full story on the Lunatic Comet</i>
<i>Incident remains a mystery.</i>

20:38.195 --> 20:44.201
<i>It is suspected that the UN2's</i>
<i>extermination of several AIs is related.</i>

20:44.868 --> 20:49.039
<i>But because of the children's actions,</i>
<i>as well as that of their drones,</i>

20:49.623 --> 20:54.044
<i>the only casualty was a female</i>
<i>Anshin employee, who was 21.</i>

20:54.670 --> 20:59.758
<i>There are rumors that it was this woman</i>
<i>who perpetrated the terrorist acts.</i>

21:00.384 --> 21:04.680
I wonder why only the videos of Nasa

<i>Mina Misasa,</i>

<i>However, most of the proceeds</i>
<i>were donated to aid victims of the event,</i>

21:59.192 --> 22:02.738
<i>On top of it all, she became a teenager</i>
<i>who is famous space-wide</i>

<i>not just as someone</i>
<i>involved in the incident,</i>

22:05.824 --> 22:07.701
<i>but for entirely different actions.</i>

22:08.827 --> 22:10.245
<i>Perhaps due to her influence,</i>

22:10.329 --> 22:13.123
<i>the number of those migrating to space</i>
<i>has doubled in the last half year,</i>

22:31.933 --> 22:33.727
None at all.

22:33.810 --> 22:37.773
There are no vestiges
of the implant left whatsoever.

22:38.607 --> 22:41.526
How long can I stay here?

22:42.527 --> 22:47.949
In terms of your freeloading, my dad said
you could stay for as long as you want.

22:48.033 --> 22:49.034
I see.

22:49.117 --> 22:50.494
WORKING FOR UN3
WHILE ATTENDING GRADUATE SCHOOL

22:50.577 --> 22:52.287
But, Touya, don't you want to go back?

22:52.871 --> 22:53.705
What?

22:53.789 --> 22:55.373
To leave Earth.

22:55.457 --> 22:58.293
Well, it is home.

22:59.127 --> 23:01.755
Thanks to my dad's work at the UN3

23:01.838 --> 23:05.217
and the implants
that you and Konoha developed,

23:05.300 --> 23:09.012
the hurdle to extraterrestrial entry
is significantly lower for minors.

23:09.096 --> 23:10.555
You can go anytime.

23:11.098 --> 23:12.224
Yeah.

23:12.307 --> 23:15.060
I plan to settle down here for a while
and work.

23:15.143 --> 23:16.520
With the UN3?

23:17.687 --> 23:23.068
Yeah. I want to do work
that protects the cradle we are in.

23:23.693 --> 23:26.071
There are many people
who want to leave the cradle,

23:26.154 --> 23:28.573
but there are also many who need it.

23:30.408 --> 23:33.078
We're still toddling around,

23:33.161 --> 23:36.706
so I think just getting in and out
of the cradle is plenty for now.

23:37.499 --> 23:40.168
<i>Furthermore,</i>
<i>nearly all of the comet's mass</i>

23:40.252 --> 23:43.672
<i>has evaporated and turned to dust</i>
<i>scattered around Earth,</i>

23:43.755 --> 23:47.259
<i>and the maximum average global</i>
<i>temperature has dropped by one degree.</i>

23:47.884 --> 23:51.263
<i>First Seven concluded that the destruction</i>
<i>of Earth's environment</i>

23:51.346 --> 23:54.975
<i>could not be resolved</i>
<i>without reducing the population on Earth,</i>

23:55.058 --> 23:59.020
<i>but preliminary estimates show</i>
<i>that it has bought us some time.</i>

23:59.104 --> 24:02.190
<i>They say this ring</i>
<i>will disappear after a few months,</i>

24:02.274 --> 24:05.610
<i>but there is an inexplicable effect</i>
<i>from a component contained in the dust.</i>

24:05.694 --> 24:08.738
<i>One theory is that Seven's</i>
<i>micro machine has influenced…</i>

24:09.573 --> 24:11.741
Well? Do you remember the spot?

24:13.160 --> 24:14.411
<i>No, I can't remember.</i>

24:14.494 --> 24:16.496
<i>If I could just remember this part,</i>

24:16.580 --> 24:18.290
<i>I could figure out how the comet</i>

24:18.373 --> 24:22.002
<i>extracted such an enormous amount</i>
<i>of energy from the water.</i>

24:22.085 --> 24:23.378
Me too.

24:23.461 --> 24:26.381
It feels like it was something
that happened in a dream.

24:27.883 --> 24:29.634
Hey, Touya.

24:30.510 --> 24:31.511
What?

24:31.595 --> 24:34.514
<i>Why did you go down to Earth?</i>
<i>You hated it so much.</i>

24:35.599 --> 24:38.185
I didn't go down to Earth.

24:38.268 --> 24:39.394
<i>What?</i>

24:39.477 --> 24:41.271
I flew.

<i>When I came into contact with that being,</i>
<i>I got smarter, and that's how I knew.</i>

25:07.923 --> 25:09.925
<i>That was why I flew out from space.</i>

25:11.176 --> 25:12.594
So did I.

25:12.677 --> 25:15.388
I flew out too.

25:16.431 --> 25:18.683
From the cradle of fate.

25:19.976 --> 25:21.019
Yeah.

25:22.229 --> 25:25.065
But there's one thing I don't understand.

25:25.148 --> 25:26.441
<i>What's that?</i>

25:26.524 --> 25:28.735
<i>No matter how we estimate it,</i>

25:28.818 --> 25:33.198
<i>I don't think a third of humanity would</i>

<i>From the data UN2 took using AI</i>
<i>at the time, it had a very small mass.</i>

25:39.788 --> 25:43.124
<i>UN2 had been deceived by Seven all along.</i>

25:44.000 --> 25:46.336
Does that mean that Seven--

25:46.419 --> 25:47.545
<i>Yeah.</i>

25:47.629 --> 25:49.339
<i>Touya! I found them!</i>

25:49.965 --> 25:53.593
Bright and Dakky fragments have
been found on Smarts here and there.

25:54.177 --> 25:59.307
They spread their own fragments
in the peer comm buffers.

25:59.391 --> 26:02.477
That's why they wouldn't say goodbye.
Then that means--

26:02.560 --> 26:05.981
Yes, we can restore them
almost completely to how they were.

26:08.441 --> 26:09.985

<i>Yeah,</i>

26:50.608 --> 26:54.154
<i>Yes. Could you all show me your letters?</i>

Do you hear that?

27:43.578 --> 27:44.704
Yeah.

27:51.795 --> 27:54.756
I wonder if that little one
called us here.

27:58.551 --> 28:01.805
It's calling from farther away now.

28:02.472 --> 28:03.473
Yeah.
