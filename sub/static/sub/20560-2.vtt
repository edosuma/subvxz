[Angelica] Will...

02:16.511 --> 02:17.345

02:18.555 --> 02:22.433
[man] The chairman obviously regrets
not being able to attend,

02:22.517 --> 02:25.687
but he had an urgent matter in Beijing.

02:25.770 --> 02:29.816
[man 2] Please thank your boss for his
cheap champagne and even cheaper excuses.

02:29.899 --> 02:33.194
[man] Our budget is ten percent of what
you spent on a military drone program.

02:33.278 --> 02:35.530
[man 2] We have the authority
to de-fund this experiment.

02:35.613 --> 02:38.283
[man] What we're promising is accuracy,
immunity.

02:38.366 --> 02:40.827
[man 2] You've been
promising it for years.

03:03.641 --> 03:05.226
What's happening?

03:05.310 --> 03:06.519
Bad things.

03:22.994 --> 03:23.870
Will...

03:25.580 --> 03:27.415
it's all my fault.

03:27.498 --> 03:30.627
But if the neural graft works,
what will they do with it?

03:32.545 --> 03:33.755
They are afraid of us.

03:34.923 --> 03:37.508
I believe this will help them
be less afraid.

03:46.100 --> 03:47.435
You trust me, don't you?

03:53.483 --> 03:55.026
Please, Will...

03:55.860 --> 03:56.861

04:06.329 --> 04:07.163
No.

Stop.

It's okay. You're okay.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.361

-It's okay.

04:40.488 --> 04:41.572
I've got you.

04:43.700 --> 04:44.826
You're safe.

04:49.831 --> 04:51.332
...and you should probably be talking to.

04:51.416 --> 04:54.669
-Thank you for taking the time to help us.
-No problem.

04:54.752 --> 04:57.338
Happy to talk with folks
who don't keep asking me

04:57.422 --> 05:00.216
-if this is going to be on the test.
-[chuckles]

05:00.300 --> 05:03.928
Grace said you were writing a thesis
on early hominoids?

05:04.012 --> 05:07.140
We're interested in the branch-off point
between Homo sapiens

05:07.223 --> 05:11.978
and other early ancestors,
like the Neanderthal and Homo sensorium.

05:12.061 --> 05:15.231
Sensorium? Now that's a term
I don't hear often.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.442
Sounds like you don't believe
they existed.

05:17.525 --> 05:21.904
Well, there's certainly not enough data
in my field to support the theory,

05:21.988 --> 05:23.531
but I'm a bits and bones gal.

05:23.614 --> 05:27.744
If you ask someone like Professor Kolovi,
a geneticist at University of Chicago,

05:27.827 --> 05:29.954
he's likely to have a different opinion.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.164
I've read his book.

05:31.247 --> 05:33.708
My condolences for that lost time.

05:33.791 --> 05:35.084
You don't agree with him?

05:35.793 --> 05:39.005
One of the reasons I find anthropology
so fascinating

05:39.088 --> 05:41.549
is that the facts themselves are evolving.

05:41.632 --> 05:44.302
Yesterday we damned or dismissed Darwin.

05:44.385 --> 05:48.765
Today we deride men like Kolovi,
calling their work science fiction.

05:48.848 --> 05:52.518
But tomorrow,
his work might seem visionary.

05:52.602 --> 05:56.022
Freud believed our ancestors
used telepathy to communicate.

05:56.105 --> 06:00.359
No one knows whether early humans
used another kind of language or not.

06:00.443 --> 06:04.572
It is a tickle to imagine,
if Kolovi's theories are accurate,

06:04.655 --> 06:06.741
a Homo sensorium
could walk into my office,

06:06.824 --> 06:10.912
-I might never even know it.
-[laughter]

06:10.995 --> 06:13.289
-I think...
-What?

06:13.372 --> 06:15.500
I am just considering
another perspective--

06:15.583 --> 06:18.086
Baby, you have to go. Dani!

06:18.169 --> 06:20.088
-Tell him he has to go!
-Hey!

06:21.297 --> 06:22.507
-That one.
-This one?

06:22.590 --> 06:24.342
-Tell him he has to go, please.
-Wait, what?

06:24.425 --> 06:25.551
-You're not coming?
-See?

06:25.635 --> 06:27.136
With everything that's going on,

06:27.220 --> 06:29.097
I don't know think that
this is the right thing to do.

06:29.180 --> 06:31.766
-It's so the right thing.
-Every premiere you stayed home.

06:31.849 --> 06:32.892
Not this time.

06:34.018 --> 06:34.852
You're coming.

06:36.229 --> 06:40.274
-I...
-Baby, you said it a hundred times.

06:40.358 --> 06:42.110
This is what you always wanted.

06:43.402 --> 06:44.237
Isn't it?

06:46.864 --> 06:49.534
-It is.

Then get dressed!
I want us all looking sensational!

06:56.374 --> 06:59.502
Why do I have this little voice
inside my head saying...

07:01.295 --> 07:03.339
"Be careful what you wish for"?

-Yes!

-Who is it?

I don't know her name.
I don't know who she is.

08:31.177 --> 08:34.805

08:38.893 --> 08:42.522

about the premiere of this film.

08:42.605 --> 08:44.190
It's one of my favorites.

08:44.273 --> 08:47.485
Would you care to comment
on the scandalous photos of you

08:47.568 --> 08:50.071
that recently went viral on the Internet?

08:51.739 --> 08:56.244
Wow, Mariana, no friendly chit-chat,
just right for the jugular.

08:58.162 --> 08:59.288
Yeah.

08:59.372 --> 09:02.083
-So you're the famous Van Damn?
-I am.

09:02.166 --> 09:04.126
My name is Capheus. And what is your name?

09:04.210 --> 09:07.630
-And this is your matatu?
-Oh, yes. Yeah.

09:07.713 --> 09:10.091
Move. You're blocking the bus.

09:11.050 --> 09:13.511
Are you denying the photos are real?

09:13.594 --> 09:16.973
No, no, no. I did not say that.

09:17.056 --> 09:19.600
So are you a homosexual?

09:21.769 --> 09:23.729
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

09:23.813 --> 09:26.274
Can you explain to me why it matters?

09:26.357 --> 09:28.401
It matters to your fans.

09:28.484 --> 09:31.195
If you are lying to them,
they have the right to know.

09:31.279 --> 09:34.115
Tell our viewers why it is
that you're called Van Damn.

09:34.657 --> 09:36.576
Have you ever seen Lionheart?

09:37.159 --> 09:38.869
No. I don't watch movies like that.

09:38.953 --> 09:42.123
-[chuckles] Movies like what?
-Movies that glorify violence.

09:42.206 --> 09:44.500
Movies where the white man
saves the world.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.503
Lionheart is not about any
of those things.

09:48.170 --> 09:50.756
-It's about courage. [laughs]
-Courage.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.926
Uh... I am very grateful to my fans.

09:54.885 --> 09:59.098
I know that, as an actor, all I tried
to give them is something true,

09:59.181 --> 10:01.475
is something from my heart.

10:01.559 --> 10:03.644
Then you were lying to them before?

10:04.353 --> 10:07.315
Lito, come on. Let's go.

10:07.398 --> 10:12.653
Is this your lover then? Sorry, I didn't
recognize him with his clothes on.

10:12.737 --> 10:13.821
Do you...

10:14.697 --> 10:17.116
-Do you know what your problem is?
-I don't have a problem.

10:17.199 --> 10:20.077
-I just want to understand--
-You're not trying to understand anything.

10:20.161 --> 10:21.829
Are you admitting you're gay or not?

10:21.912 --> 10:24.790
No, you're not trying
to understand anything. Because...

10:24.874 --> 10:27.251
...labels are the opposite
of understanding.

10:27.335 --> 10:29.003
But Van Damme is white.

10:30.212 --> 10:31.380
Yes.

10:31.464 --> 10:34.342
So even if it's about courage,
it's about white courage.

10:34.967 --> 10:39.263
I'm sorry. Maybe I'm not understanding,
but what does courage have to do with...

10:39.347 --> 10:41.182
...the color of a man's skin?

10:48.105 --> 10:49.857
-I was just a little kid...
-...who loved...

10:49.940 --> 10:52.818
-...movies. And the...
-...heroes I watched...

10:52.902 --> 10:55.946
-...made me feel like I was...
-...braver than I was.

10:56.030 --> 10:58.532
-Funnier.
-Smarter.

10:58.616 --> 11:00.785
They made me feel
that I could do things that I...

11:00.868 --> 11:02.912
-...made me believe I could do things...
-...I didn't think...

11:02.995 --> 11:03.996
...think I could do.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.415
But that boy who watched TV
with his mama...

11:06.499 --> 11:08.834
...mama, and grandma, and aunties...

11:08.918 --> 11:12.463
...and aunties, is not the man
who became an actor.

11:12.546 --> 11:15.299
...not the man who became a driver.
That driver is not the same...

Oh, no. Not at all.

I do, because I haven't been able

17:00.144 --> 17:01.353
Most people suck.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.272
They pretend, lie.

17:04.023 --> 17:07.860
They do anything to manipulate and control
the situation around them.

17:10.279 --> 17:15.159
In a world such as this, the most precious
thing a man can find is loyalty.

17:16.243 --> 17:17.327
Yeah.

17:18.328 --> 17:23.000
I know how loyal you are to your friend
and how loyal he is to you.

17:24.543 --> 17:26.336
I admire that kind of loyalty.

17:31.550 --> 17:33.510
What do you think about this club, Felix?

17:33.594 --> 17:34.803
What do I think of it?

17:34.887 --> 17:37.347
Are you kidding me? It fucking rocks.

17:37.431 --> 17:39.475
I want to live here.

17:39.558 --> 17:40.851
Yeah.

17:47.107 --> 17:50.944
-Good. It's yours.
-What?

17:51.028 --> 17:54.198
I'll have my lawyers prepare the paperwork
in the morning.

17:54.281 --> 17:56.158
You can sign them at my place.

17:58.660 --> 17:59.953
I'll see you there.

18:01.205 --> 18:02.331
A pleasure.

18:09.463 --> 18:11.131
What did he say?

18:13.884 --> 18:16.303
He just... gave me the club.

18:16.386 --> 18:19.431
[dog barking in distance]

18:22.476 --> 18:24.561
[Zakia] I think I used to be able to think
the way that you do.

18:25.187 --> 18:28.524
At university, I believed in progress,
that what you did mattered,

18:28.607 --> 18:30.234
that things were getting better.

18:30.818 --> 18:35.239
But now, I don't know,
I think I've seen too much of the world.

18:35.322 --> 18:38.784
But you are a woman,
working as a journalist.

18:38.867 --> 18:40.869
That wouldn't have been possible
for our grandmothers.

18:41.662 --> 18:45.874
Yeah, I know. And I used to believe
that those kind of details were important.

18:47.209 --> 18:51.713
I think about my grandmother's life
and I cannot call your life a "detail."

18:52.589 --> 18:56.260
-It is her dream coming true.
-It seems so small...

18:56.718 --> 19:01.223
compared to the scale of what was wrong
back then and what is still wrong.

19:01.306 --> 19:02.850
Hm.

19:04.810 --> 19:09.189
I've seen such... barbaric things...

19:10.566 --> 19:15.529
such cruelty, injustice,
and then complete indifference to it all.

19:16.613 --> 19:18.949
How can it matter what job it is
that I do?

19:20.159 --> 19:22.327
Many terrible things happen every day.

19:23.620 --> 19:26.748
They have happened to me, to my family.

19:29.376 --> 19:31.712
It's why courage is so important.

19:32.421 --> 19:35.883
It takes courage to see
such terrible things happen

19:35.966 --> 19:38.260
and still get up every day...

19:40.053 --> 19:42.055
and be able to see
what is still beautiful.

19:42.139 --> 19:46.894
It takes courage to remember
that this is a world where our dreams,

19:46.977 --> 19:50.606
like our grandmothers', do come true.

20:17.549 --> 20:18.800
Will, can you hear me?

20:20.510 --> 20:22.429
I heard horses.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.765
Neville's grown up.

20:26.683 --> 20:27.851
Neville?

20:29.311 --> 20:30.395
He's beautiful.

20:33.065 --> 20:36.860
[hooves thundering]

20:37.986 --> 20:39.780
[Riley] Can you tell me what you see?

20:41.114 --> 20:42.282
[Will] There's a lot of land.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.076
Big house.

20:45.452 --> 20:49.498
The horse seems to know what he wants,
like he can read his thoughts.

20:49.581 --> 20:52.125
It's like they share one mind.

20:52.209 --> 20:54.253
Wouldn't that make it easier?

20:54.962 --> 20:58.173
Of course, then you'd know all the wicked
things I was hoping to do to you

20:58.257 --> 20:59.967
before I lose you to Chicago.

21:01.301 --> 21:03.971
I like it better when you surprise me.

21:04.054 --> 21:05.764
[both chuckle softly]

21:06.723 --> 21:08.308
Take your pills, dear.

21:09.768 --> 21:11.061
Yes, dear.

21:21.029 --> 21:22.739
What about a name?

21:23.448 --> 21:25.450
I was so close this time.

21:27.160 --> 21:28.662
I just saw his wife.

21:30.038 --> 21:31.623
Did you hear a name?

21:31.707 --> 21:35.961
Chicago. Nomi has to go to Chicago.

21:40.924 --> 21:42.968
Okay, but now you need to eat.

21:43.927 --> 21:45.846
-Will?
-I'm too tired.

21:50.851 --> 21:53.645
You can't just keep
all these secrets, Kala.

21:53.729 --> 21:56.440
At some point you have to tell me
about the honeymoon.

21:56.523 --> 21:59.151
Kala... I can't get him to eat.

21:59.234 --> 22:00.736
Have you tried the orexigenic?

22:00.819 --> 22:02.446
Is he not eating? I knew it.

22:02.529 --> 22:05.198
He's lost weight. Are you sure he's happy?

22:05.282 --> 22:08.035
He's fine, okay? We're fine. I just--
Excuse me.

22:12.956 --> 22:14.207
[Kala] Let me check.

22:23.884 --> 22:25.927
His reactions are getting very slow.

22:27.512 --> 22:28.722
Sleep cycle's shorter.

22:29.723 --> 22:30.974
All he does is sleep.

22:31.850 --> 22:35.103
Drug-induced unconsciousness
is not the same as sleep.

22:36.772 --> 22:39.816
I'll increase his vitamins
and small amounts of naloxone.

22:42.986 --> 22:46.573
But the fact is that we cannot
keep this up for much longer.

22:46.656 --> 22:51.870
He's hoping to get more information
on Whispers or BPO.

22:52.996 --> 22:54.873
Nomi hasn't been able to find out more?

22:54.956 --> 22:57.501
Nomi has one of the best
code-breaking minds in the world

22:57.584 --> 22:59.753
looking for any crack in this company.

22:59.836 --> 23:03.924
But every time we find one,
they seem to burn the house down.

23:04.966 --> 23:07.177
-[beeping]
-Shit!

23:08.637 --> 23:09.846
Shit!

23:25.320 --> 23:26.404
Did they tag you?

23:31.535 --> 23:33.703
These people are good.

23:34.579 --> 23:39.459
And impressively, they might be
even more paranoid than I am.

23:42.921 --> 23:45.382
What about the records
from the facility in Iceland?

23:45.465 --> 23:48.844
Neets linked some obvious aliases
to visas for charter travel,

23:48.927 --> 23:53.306
but we still can't tell who's actually
running or paying for that company.

23:53.390 --> 23:55.934
Um, sorry, was that to me?

23:56.017 --> 23:58.937
I warned you she talks to herself
a lot these days.

23:59.980 --> 24:03.483
We can keep digging, but really what
we need is something more specific:

24:03.567 --> 24:05.235
a direction, a name, a bank account.

24:05.318 --> 24:08.196
Will has to get us something
more concrete.

24:13.076 --> 24:16.746
You fight so hard for us,
but this is not a fight for you alone.

24:21.751 --> 24:23.879
His Chi's very weak.

24:23.962 --> 24:25.338
[Lito] It's been months.

24:26.131 --> 24:28.884
How long does he think we can keep hiding?

24:30.051 --> 24:31.428
I don't know.

24:38.518 --> 24:39.686
Don't give up on him.

24:41.438 --> 24:43.398
He wouldn't give up on any of us.

24:58.288 --> 25:01.416
We are all family now
and I want to discuss our future.

25:02.042 --> 25:05.128
There's nothing quite like an attempt
on one's life

25:05.212 --> 25:07.380
to make one examine one's priorities.

25:07.464 --> 25:12.344
Last Sunday, I had a meeting
at the prime minister's office.

25:12.427 --> 25:16.806
And he told me that as a modernizer
and a businessman,

25:16.890 --> 25:18.642
I am an electoral asset.

25:18.725 --> 25:24.773
And this afternoon,
for the sake of India and its future,

25:24.856 --> 25:28.193
I've told the prime minister
that I most humbly accept his offer.

25:28.276 --> 25:30.153
[coughing]

25:30.987 --> 25:34.032
Dad, I thought you said you would not
make a decision without consulting us.

25:34.115 --> 25:37.202
I didn't build this giant
pharmaceutical empire by dillydallying.

25:38.995 --> 25:40.622
And how do you feel about this, Mum?

25:40.705 --> 25:43.917
[father] Your mother has always supported
all my decisions.

25:44.709 --> 25:49.172
Support is the open secret
of any successful marriage.

25:51.675 --> 25:52.676
Mum?

25:54.386 --> 25:56.930
It is as your father says it is, Rajan.

25:57.013 --> 25:59.266
This is a momentous occasion indeed.

25:59.349 --> 26:01.101
May I offer my congratulations
to you, Manendra?

26:01.184 --> 26:02.352
Thank you.

26:02.435 --> 26:06.481
As well as my deep heartfelt wish
for this new family's happiness. Cheers!

26:06.564 --> 26:09.192
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

26:25.125 --> 26:31.548
Wittgenstein wrote that "the limits of
my language are the limits of my world."

26:31.631 --> 26:36.136
We tend to think so highly of language
because we think so highly of ourselves.

26:36.219 --> 26:41.308
Yet imagine being able to communicate
thought and feeling without words.

26:42.309 --> 26:43.935
Words.

26:44.019 --> 26:46.688
Their inadequacy is a cliché.

26:46.771 --> 26:49.316
"Words can't express."
"Words aren't enough."

26:49.399 --> 26:51.609
"I can't find the words."

26:51.693 --> 26:53.903
But what if you didn't have to?

26:54.446 --> 26:55.280
Hmm.

26:55.363 --> 26:59.659
Now, there is no way to prove whether
our early ancestors used language

26:59.743 --> 27:01.411
as we know it or not.

27:01.494 --> 27:05.457
Yet, if language supplanted
this older communication,

27:05.540 --> 27:08.626
the obvious conclusion
is that language must be superior,

27:08.710 --> 27:10.587
sequitur quod, so are we.

27:10.670 --> 27:13.673
More to the point,
what evolutionary advantage

27:13.757 --> 27:17.302
would our form of communication
have over theirs?

27:17.385 --> 27:21.264
What couldn't you do
if people could read your thoughts?

27:22.724 --> 27:25.560
For starters, you couldn't lie.

27:27.771 --> 27:32.317
There was a time we thought our place
in the world was the will of the Divine.

27:32.901 --> 27:36.988
As that rationale fell out of favor,
it was the science of the Enlightenment

27:37.072 --> 27:39.866
that provided any number of answers
to our ascendancy.

27:39.949 --> 27:42.911
It is only recently,
in light of the havoc and devastation

27:42.994 --> 27:45.163
our existence has inflicted on this planet

27:45.246 --> 27:48.416
have we begun to question the nature
of our supremacy.

27:49.584 --> 27:52.003
When we consider our ancestral relatives,

27:52.087 --> 27:55.965
we have typically blamed their extinction
on their own bad luck.

27:56.549 --> 28:00.136
Mounting evidence however suggests
that it was not an accident

28:00.220 --> 28:02.222
nor a failure of adaptation.

28:02.305 --> 28:05.433
Our cousins' untimely demise

28:05.517 --> 28:10.855
was the result of a rather extended
and brutal genocide.

28:10.939 --> 28:15.443
And what's more, the children
of these barbaric murderers

28:15.527 --> 28:19.572
-are actually sitting right in this room.
-[laughter]

28:19.656 --> 28:21.116
And standing at this podium.

28:22.575 --> 28:26.329
What happened to the Neanderthal?
To the Denisovans?

28:26.413 --> 28:28.915
To Homo asiaticus and naledi?

28:29.666 --> 28:32.836
Homo sapiens happened.

28:32.919 --> 28:36.756
[chuckles] We came along
and we wiped all of them out.

28:37.716 --> 28:38.591
Heh.

28:39.926 --> 28:42.011
[Kolovi] So I've been told you're working
on a thesis

28:42.095 --> 28:44.180
concerning the evidence
for Homo sensorium.

28:44.264 --> 28:46.766
-[Nomi] That's right.
-In your book, Being Human Beings,

28:46.850 --> 28:48.810
you argued for their existence.

28:48.893 --> 28:52.397
Does that mean you believe
they could still be existing today?

28:52.480 --> 28:56.860
[laughs] Look, if you ask me what I know
as opposed to what I believe,

28:56.943 --> 29:00.447
I know we've inherited some important bits
of DNA from our ancestors

29:00.530 --> 29:04.784
and as I suggested in my book,
what we gained from the sensorium,

29:04.868 --> 29:06.661
the insula of the frontal cortices,

29:06.745 --> 29:11.499
which is fundamental to our capacity
for empathy, isn't just any part.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.585
Some would argue it is the best part.

29:15.086 --> 29:19.132
Can we ask you about one of your students?
Dr. Matheson.

29:19.215 --> 29:20.049
Matheson?

29:21.301 --> 29:24.471
Names. Now you're testing me, Ms. Keene.

29:24.554 --> 29:26.389
Your name is uncommonly familiar.

29:26.473 --> 29:28.850
Have you written anything I might've read?

29:28.933 --> 29:32.020
God, I hope so.
That would make this so much cooler.

29:32.103 --> 29:33.605
We have a picture.

29:40.737 --> 29:42.447
Ah, yes. Matheson.

29:42.530 --> 29:47.202
Very bright. Quiet, as I recall.
Not much of a socializer.

29:47.285 --> 29:48.578
That's him.

29:48.661 --> 29:49.871
What about him?

29:49.954 --> 29:52.207
You don't happen to know
how we could reach him?

29:52.290 --> 29:56.461
We found a paper he wrote and we were
wondering how he came to some results.

29:56.544 --> 29:57.754
No idea.

29:57.837 --> 30:01.007
Probably haven't heard from him
since he left. When was this, the '80s?

30:01.090 --> 30:03.009
My God, look how young I was.

30:03.092 --> 30:06.554
Now, if you have other questions,
you can leave them with my assistant.

30:06.638 --> 30:10.809
But I really have to run.
Genetics lab in ten minutes.

30:10.892 --> 30:13.102
Thank you so much for your time.

30:21.361 --> 30:22.445
What'd you think?

30:23.029 --> 30:26.533
I think he was right about the advantage
of language over telepathy.

30:26.616 --> 30:29.869
Because he could be just
a sweet forgetful professor

30:29.953 --> 30:31.704
or a really cunning liar.

30:35.333 --> 30:36.292
[Riley] Okay...

30:38.127 --> 30:39.045
try this.

30:47.512 --> 30:49.764
-God, that's good.
-[both laugh]

30:50.932 --> 30:53.601
It's from a farm I used to work on
when I was young.

30:54.602 --> 30:56.521
It was run by three sisters.

30:57.230 --> 31:00.817
-They used to love my dad's music.
-Sh, sh, sh...

31:03.695 --> 31:06.406
I told you that details are dangerous.

31:08.199 --> 31:10.201
He could be listening at any moment.

31:15.331 --> 31:16.791
Sorry.

31:24.465 --> 31:26.217
You can feel it, can't you?

31:27.635 --> 31:28.928
I'm close.

31:31.014 --> 31:33.266
I just wish there was another way.

31:34.058 --> 31:36.519
Does she realize
she's protecting you to death?

31:39.564 --> 31:41.149
[exhales]

31:41.232 --> 31:42.775
-He's here.
-Should I get a shot?

31:45.320 --> 31:47.614
The Will Gorski who used to be a cop.

31:47.697 --> 31:50.116
The Will Gorski who came to this island.

31:50.199 --> 31:53.244
The Will Gorski who wanted
to save Ms. Gunnardottir.

31:54.245 --> 31:57.165
That Will Gorski is dying.

31:58.499 --> 32:00.501
If he's not already dead.

32:01.210 --> 32:03.630
Your concern's real touching, Milt.

32:04.839 --> 32:07.467
Oh, and that was really slick
on the island bait.

32:09.052 --> 32:11.596
Did I blink? Take a breath?

32:12.388 --> 32:14.807
Or was I faking it...

32:15.767 --> 32:17.685
to make you think
we are still on some island

32:17.769 --> 32:19.687
that we have left months ago?

32:22.440 --> 32:24.067
I know you've been watching me.

32:25.026 --> 32:26.235
Good.

50:50.172 --> 50:51.840
-He's got kids.
-Got it.

50:51.923 --> 50:55.218
Sir, I... I have a serious problem.

50:55.302 --> 50:56.762
These are our most likely.

50:57.679 --> 50:58.513
No.

50:59.097 --> 51:00.223
No.

51:00.932 --> 51:02.058
Come on.

51:02.851 --> 51:04.686
Stop.

51:05.604 --> 51:06.813
That's him.

51:09.775 --> 51:12.402
-Richard Wilson...
-Croome.

51:12.486 --> 51:16.114
Richard Wilson Croome.

51:20.577 --> 51:22.162
I'm compromised.

51:22.245 --> 51:26.458
Your last breach of protocol is still
costing us millions of dollars in Iceland.

51:26.541 --> 51:29.461
I'm compromised. I... I have to go.

51:29.544 --> 51:31.004
-Gibbons!
-I have to go!

51:31.087 --> 51:31.963
Gibbons!

51:37.093 --> 51:38.845
You think you're hunting us?

51:39.554 --> 51:40.931
We're coming for you.
