59:05.242 --> 59:07.309
He's just scared.

in a room with no doors,

59:09.380 --> 59:12.881

59:12.883 --> 59:15.384

59:17.021 --> 59:18.253

59:19.857 --> 59:21.290
- The plan was to
get him to face

59:21.292 --> 59:23.625

59:23.627 --> 59:25.394
He needs to face his fears.

59:25.396 --> 59:27.763

you can't leave him.

59:27.765 --> 59:31.300
- What he feels, I feel.

59:31.302 --> 59:33.368
And he's been like
this for over a year.

59:34.672 --> 59:37.773
Look, I'm just saying,
his mind is very active.

59:38.909 --> 59:41.810
It's just creating these things,

59:41.812 --> 59:43.178
some are memories,

59:45.516 --> 59:47.449
and some are just made up.

59:48.652 --> 59:50.586
But every time I alter
his surroundings,

59:50.588 --> 59:52.688
there's something else waiting.

59:54.058 --> 59:56.091
He's just lost in there.

59:56.093 --> 59:59.828
Scared and alone with only
those three months of hell

59:59.830 --> 1:00:01.029
to keep him company.

1:00:02.399 --> 1:00:04.132
I feel this fear as he does.

1:00:05.269 --> 1:00:07.502
I know the truth,
but to him it's...

1:00:07.504 --> 1:00:10.072
It's very real, and when
it gets too real for him,

1:00:11.542 --> 1:00:13.342
he comes out,

1:00:15.913 --> 1:00:17.746
and that just brings us back

1:00:17.748 --> 1:00:19.481
closer to when we started.

1:00:20.584 --> 1:00:23.585
- Are you sure he can
handle facing him alone?

1:00:23.587 --> 1:00:25.220
- No, no I'm not.

1:00:25.222 --> 1:00:27.089
That's what I need you for.

1:00:27.091 --> 1:00:28.824
- What can I do?

1:00:28.826 --> 1:00:31.193
- I need you to talk
to him, using that.

1:00:36.867 --> 1:00:39.668
- You want me to talk to him?

1:00:39.670 --> 1:00:42.237
- I can only alter his
surroundings so much.

1:00:43.340 --> 1:00:44.706
I'll be telling you
just what to say,

1:00:44.708 --> 1:00:48.510
and you can only say
exactly what I tell you.

1:00:50.080 --> 1:00:53.348
- I've never done this
kind of thing before.

1:00:53.350 --> 1:00:55.484
- You know, I usually
deal with PTSD patients,

1:00:55.486 --> 1:00:58.220
that, you know, they tell
me what happened to them,

1:00:58.222 --> 1:01:00.589
and I help them face what
it is they need to face.

1:01:00.591 --> 1:01:01.490
Helps them cope.

1:01:02.893 --> 1:01:05.360
I've only had 11 patients
including your boy,

1:01:06.497 --> 1:01:11.166
but he's the first I've
had in this situation.

1:01:13.771 --> 1:01:15.404
So I don't know.

1:01:15.406 --> 1:01:16.705
I don't know if it
will work or not,

1:01:16.707 --> 1:01:18.106
but one thing I do know

1:01:18.108 --> 1:01:20.642
is that he has one
parent left in this world

1:01:20.644 --> 1:01:23.011
that he's relied on
for the past 8 years,

1:01:23.847 --> 1:01:26.815
and that caring, loving parent

1:01:27.851 --> 1:01:29.685
can be a very
powerful influence.

1:13:14.591 --> 1:13:16.858
Just talk to your son.

1:13:23.533 --> 1:13:26.334
(water gurgling)

1:13:30.206 --> 1:13:31.105
- Mom?

1:13:33.777 --> 1:13:36.677
(woman chuckling)

1:13:58.802 --> 1:13:59.700
Mom?

1:14:06.810 --> 1:14:09.043
- What if he doesn't
listen to me?

1:14:09.045 --> 1:14:10.545
- The only thing
that's kept him alive

1:14:10.547 --> 1:14:13.781
was thinking, if he
died, you'd be all alone.

1:14:13.783 --> 1:14:15.750
That's how I know
he'll listen to you.

1:14:18.688 --> 1:14:19.587
- Mom?

1:14:23.660 --> 1:14:25.993
- You have to swim, Steven.

1:14:28.131 --> 1:14:31.365
(scary strings music)

1:14:35.104 --> 1:14:36.637
- Tell him he
needs to swim down!

1:14:36.639 --> 1:14:40.541
- Swim down, honey, you have
to swim as deep as you can.

1:14:48.918 --> 1:14:50.384
- Tell him again, Kate!

1:14:50.386 --> 1:14:51.552
Tell him!

1:14:51.554 --> 1:14:53.187
- Swim, baby, swim!

1:15:00.430 --> 1:15:02.263
Keep swimming, honey, please!

1:15:02.265 --> 1:15:03.331
Swim back to me!

1:15:06.669 --> 1:15:07.568
Steven?

1:15:08.538 --> 1:15:09.437
Steven?

1:15:18.248 --> 1:15:20.314
(gasps)

1:15:24.521 --> 1:15:26.754
(sobbing)

1:15:42.805 --> 1:15:46.707
- You gave us a good
scare there for a moment.

1:15:50.647 --> 1:15:51.546
- Where am I?

1:15:52.649 --> 1:15:54.615
- My name is Dr. Soble.

1:15:54.617 --> 1:15:56.617
You're in my home office.

1:15:56.619 --> 1:15:57.885
It's actually my garage,

1:15:57.887 --> 1:16:01.656
but I like to think
of it as my office.

1:16:01.658 --> 1:16:04.759
You're a very brave kid, Steven.

1:16:04.761 --> 1:16:06.360
You're also lucky that the man

1:16:06.362 --> 1:16:08.462
who owns the giant
property you were found on

1:16:08.464 --> 1:16:10.731
checked on it when he did.

1:16:12.769 --> 1:16:14.936
I'm sorry about Michelle.

1:16:17.740 --> 1:16:19.206
Did you know her?

1:16:20.476 --> 1:16:22.109
- No.

1:16:22.111 --> 1:16:23.077
But she helped me.

1:16:23.913 --> 1:16:25.813
- Did she talk to you?

1:16:27.550 --> 1:16:30.051
It's not your fault, Steven.

1:16:30.053 --> 1:16:32.720
What happened to her, it's not.

1:16:40.597 --> 1:16:41.596
- Did he catch him?

1:16:44.133 --> 1:16:46.767
- The detective who
worked your case

1:16:46.769 --> 1:16:51.005
kept your discovery secret
from the public for two weeks,

1:16:51.007 --> 1:16:55.142
hoping that the person
who did this would return.

1:16:57.780 --> 1:16:58.946
He never did.

1:17:01.250 --> 1:17:05.353
There was no evidence,
suspects, or witnesses

1:17:05.355 --> 1:17:06.253
until now.

1:17:08.958 --> 1:17:13.427
Look, I never saw his face,
but I believe you did.

1:17:13.429 --> 1:17:15.963
Together, we can catch this guy,

1:17:15.965 --> 1:17:18.766
so this doesn't happen
to anybody else.

1:17:18.768 --> 1:17:20.001
- We have to try.

1:17:22.805 --> 1:17:24.271
- I'll help.

1:17:24.273 --> 1:17:25.973
I don't wanna be
scared any more.

1:17:27.710 --> 1:17:29.910
- You're a brave kid, Steven.

1:17:29.912 --> 1:17:32.580
I'll help you, and your
mother will be by your side

1:17:32.582 --> 1:17:34.148
all the way, okay?
