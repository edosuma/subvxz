You and my mom have gotten
so much closer,

28:25.834 --> 28:27.042

your sister to be there today,

able to see a lot of self work

for four years now.

28:38.209 --> 28:40.292
They've met drunk James,

28:40.292 --> 28:42.792
and they've met angry James.

It's a little nerve-racking
when I'm with my family,

28:45.042 --> 28:49.501
because I don't know
what James is gonna show up.

Wow, this is so beautiful.

Let me get your chair.

29:14.709 --> 29:15.667
-Hi!
-What's up?

29:15.667 --> 29:19.209

-Hello!

29:19.209 --> 29:21.000
You look beautiful.
So good to see you.

29:24.292 --> 29:25.792
How you doing? Good to see you.

29:25.792 --> 29:26.584
Kate and I weren't always close.

29:26.584 --> 29:29.209
You know, we didn't have
a lot in common.

29:29.209 --> 29:30.709
I was adopted at birth.

29:30.709 --> 29:37.083
My biological mom, Susan,
gave birth to Kate before me.

29:37.083 --> 29:39.083
Oh, it's so pretty.

29:39.083 --> 29:42.959
And then Susan accidentally
got pregnant again

29:42.959 --> 29:44.375
right around the time
that my Aunt Laura

29:44.375 --> 29:46.626
was trying to conceive.

29:46.626 --> 29:48.375
Susan was generous enough

29:48.375 --> 29:51.417
to offer to have me
for my aunt.

29:51.417 --> 29:55.918
But Kate had kinda stepped
into my life a little bit more,

29:55.918 --> 29:58.459
and she wants to be
that big sister role to me.

I mean, my mom and I's
relationship has

30:13.083 --> 30:14.334
gotten so much better.

30:14.334 --> 30:16.042
When you were first breaking up
with dad,

30:16.042 --> 30:18.167
I was in ----ing hell.
-We all were in hell, James.

30:18.167 --> 30:20.751
-I'm just stating my feelings.
-It wasn't just the James hell.

30:20.751 --> 30:22.834
-Don't do that, James.
-'Cause your tone, your tone,

30:22.834 --> 30:24.167
your tone!
-Yes, my tone!

30:24.167 --> 30:25.334
Now that we both don't drink,

30:25.334 --> 30:27.792
there's just an innocence
and a lightness to it again.

30:27.792 --> 30:29.167
-I know.
-We're sitting.

Look at that thing. We still
need to get it resized.

It's, uh,
it's a little bit big,

30:38.167 --> 30:41.417

when she's at work.

30:41.417 --> 30:43.042
Washing your hands.
Don't take it off.

30:43.042 --> 30:44.292
-Don't take it off.
-Don't take it off.

30:44.292 --> 30:45.417
-Just get it dirty.
-Don't take it off?

30:45.417 --> 30:46.375
-Don't take it off to wash.
-You could maybe like

30:46.375 --> 30:48.626
another one in front of it,
like another--

30:48.626 --> 30:51.000
You can't take it off. Don't
take it off in public bathrooms.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.459
You could put maybe like
a little other ring up front--

30:54.459 --> 30:56.125
in front of it
to, like, stop it.

30:56.125 --> 30:57.584
Well, that's why I wanted,
like, you know,

30:57.584 --> 31:01.125
to get, like, a replica made
in case we go out out.

-So excited.

any different.

You are a very happy girl.

-Come here and sit down.

31:42.834 --> 31:46.876
It was very sweet.
But I brought the gift for Max.

31:46.876 --> 31:48.626
-Mm!
-And...

31:48.626 --> 31:51.459
-How'd that go? How did it go?

Aw.

31:58.375 --> 32:02.125
Well, he really
is very remorseful.

32:02.125 --> 32:05.000
He wanted me to deliver
this apology gift to you.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.626
Okay. "Sorry for what I said
and did.

32:07.626 --> 32:09.417
You have always been
such a good friend.

32:09.417 --> 32:14.083
Love you, mate. Hope you can get
back to the good times soon."

32:14.083 --> 32:15.042
[chuckles] Hopefully.

32:15.042 --> 32:16.334
What gift?

32:16.334 --> 32:17.834
-You miss the friendship.
-So wait.

32:17.834 --> 32:18.959
No one knows what
we're talking about.

32:18.959 --> 32:21.209
Basically, what happened,
I went to dinner with Max.

32:21.209 --> 32:23.375
We got into an argument.

32:23.375 --> 32:24.375
I did things that
I shouldn't have done

32:24.375 --> 32:26.584
and I said some things
I shouldn't have said.

32:26.584 --> 32:28.584
-Yeah.
-It just escalated.

32:28.584 --> 32:29.751
He was like kinda--
like, he said something to me,

32:29.751 --> 32:32.083
and it didn't sit right.
I dipped my fingers in my water,

32:32.083 --> 32:34.417
and I was like, "Wake up."

32:34.417 --> 32:38.626
You can cause issues sober
or drunk.

32:38.626 --> 32:41.542
My family's been so open
and love Raquel

32:41.542 --> 32:43.000
right off the bat,

32:43.000 --> 32:44.834
but for me, um,
with Raquel's family,

32:44.834 --> 32:47.375
it was a bit more of a journey.

32:47.375 --> 32:49.959
Yeah, I mean, I called him
a fat [bleep].

32:49.959 --> 32:53.584
And I said, "This is why
you don't have a girlfriend."

32:53.584 --> 32:56.167
And I just said, "[bleep] you."

32:56.167 --> 32:57.083
Yeah, but people are allowed
to get mad.

32:57.083 --> 32:59.375
They're allowed to feel
their feelings.

32:59.375 --> 33:01.209
Not everybody's perfect.

33:01.209 --> 33:05.209
So I talked to Max,
and I explained to him that

33:05.209 --> 33:08.083
James misses him so much.
-Yeah.

33:08.083 --> 33:09.792
And I gave him the gift.

33:09.792 --> 33:13.834
Good.
You're on the right track.

33:13.834 --> 33:15.292
He accepted the gift, right?

33:15.292 --> 33:16.918
Why did you have to give him
the gift?

33:16.918 --> 33:18.626
Well, because they
haven't been talking,

33:18.626 --> 33:20.083
and it was just more of a--
-Well, I'm blocked.

33:20.083 --> 33:21.709
I'm blocked on everything.

33:21.709 --> 33:23.459
I can't even get in touch
with him if I tried.

33:23.459 --> 33:26.709
He accepted it from you,
and just give him time.

33:26.709 --> 33:28.959
Yeah, he opened it up,
and he was like,

33:28.959 --> 33:30.334
"Oh, James and I..."
-He smiled.

33:30.334 --> 33:31.959
"...used to play Oculus,
like, all the time."

33:31.959 --> 33:34.375
I just don't wanna see you
in situation

33:34.375 --> 33:38.292
that you have to fix
his problems.

33:38.292 --> 33:40.626
I never thought
that I was trying

33:40.626 --> 33:42.834
to fix James' situation
at all.

33:42.834 --> 33:47.834
I just figured I'm trying
to help out my fiancé.

33:47.834 --> 33:50.000
But Kate hasn't always been
supportive

33:50.000 --> 33:54.083
of James and my relationship
because of James' drinking.

33:54.083 --> 33:55.751
She is my big sister,

33:55.751 --> 33:57.751
and she's always gonna be
protective of me.

33:57.751 --> 34:01.375
The main thing is just
making sure that

34:01.375 --> 34:03.000
you realize it affects
both of you.

34:03.000 --> 34:06.209
It could affect
her workplace situation.

34:06.209 --> 34:07.542
It can affect her relationships.

34:07.542 --> 34:08.792
-Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm.
-You know?

34:08.792 --> 34:10.792
And it's you have to start
thinking about the both of you

34:10.792 --> 34:13.709
as one unit, you know?
-Yeah, 100%.

34:13.709 --> 34:15.292
Yeah, 'cause unfortunately,
there will be a time where

35:31.417 --> 35:33.501
and he's going
to the fertility doctor.

35:33.501 --> 35:35.834
Are you serious about having
a baby and all?

35:35.834 --> 35:37.501
-Yeah.
-Why is he going

35:37.501 --> 35:39.501
to the fertility doctor
before you've even tried?

35:39.501 --> 35:42.000
Well, we did try.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.250
You did try.

35:43.250 --> 35:46.709
It was not successful.

35:46.709 --> 35:49.125
-Um...
-How did you feel?

35:49.125 --> 35:50.626
Was it really difficult?

35:50.626 --> 35:55.501
It got progressively
more difficult,

35:55.501 --> 35:57.083
and then you're thinking, like,
is something wrong with me?

35:57.083 --> 36:00.000
Am I old? 'Cause people like
to put that in your head.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.209
The first time, it was like,
okay,

36:02.209 --> 36:05.209
I can't expect it to happen
on the first time, obviously.

36:05.209 --> 36:08.959
You know? That only happens
for, like, Lala.

36:08.959 --> 36:10.792
You don't know how many times
she tried.

36:10.792 --> 36:14.792
That girl literally was like,
IUD, pop!

36:14.792 --> 36:16.584
And then got pregnant, like,
4 1/2 seconds later.

36:16.584 --> 36:18.042
I was like, what?

36:18.042 --> 36:20.792
Well, you hadm't started
trying then, had you?

36:20.792 --> 36:23.292
Mm-hmm. Yeah. But then by, like,
the fifth or sixth time,

36:23.292 --> 36:25.042
I was like, you know what?

36:25.042 --> 36:29.584
I need to just take a break

When it didn't happen for us,
everyone, you know,

36:32.083 --> 36:34.000
was, like, encouraging
to keep trying,

36:36.417 --> 36:37.501

36:37.501 --> 36:39.709

feeling a little left out.

37:06.959 --> 37:09.000

very difficult
