<i>We all just gotta unplug</i>

00:20.187 --> 00:22.564
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

00:22.648 --> 00:24.942
<i>Just like the way Doug unplugs</i>

00:26.777 --> 00:29.655
Sensors indicate that tickles, Mom.

00:30.197 --> 00:31.198
Sorry, Doug.

00:31.281 --> 00:35.410
But there! I've finished your yearly upgrade.

00:35.494 --> 00:39.331
Now all your robo-tools should be even more effective.

00:39.414 --> 00:40.874
Go ahead, try them.

00:43.085 --> 00:46.338
My flashlight eyes can glow in even more colors.

00:48.173 --> 00:50.217
And I've got a bigger holo-screen.

00:52.427 --> 00:55.764
And bouncier robo-springs!

00:57.391 --> 00:59.935
Wow, this upgrade is bot-tastic.

01:00.018 --> 01:02.145
Glad you like it, my bot.

01:02.229 --> 01:04.857
And look, I even added a new feature.

01:04.940 --> 01:06.775
A wonder-ometer.

01:06.859 --> 01:09.236
It fills up whenever you wonder about something.

01:09.319 --> 01:12.823
The wonder-ometer will help you discover some amazing new things.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.158
Wow, Mom, you're the optimum!

01:15.242 --> 01:17.661
I'm so excited. I gotta go show Emma.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.624
Doug, what are you doing here?

01:22.708 --> 01:26.795
I came to show you my new upgrades, but it looks like you got one too.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.756
And it's a jet pack!

01:29.840 --> 01:32.050
Doug, it's a backpack.

01:32.134 --> 01:33.719
I wear it when I go to school.

01:33.802 --> 01:35.387
School? What's that?

01:36.138 --> 01:38.056
Hold on. What's that?

01:38.140 --> 01:39.725
My new wonder-ometer.

01:39.808 --> 01:42.144
Whenever I wonder about something, it fills up.

01:42.227 --> 01:45.230
And right now I wonder, what is school?

01:50.861 --> 01:53.238
And what was that?

01:53.822 --> 01:55.782
I guess that was my wonder-ometer.

01:55.866 --> 01:58.160
But I'm still super curious about school.

01:58.243 --> 01:59.578
Time to give it a plug.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.748
<i>Learning is a nonstop journey</i>

02:02.831 --> 02:04.374
<i>And it starts today</i>

02:04.458 --> 02:08.419
<i>Going to school with other kids To discover new things</i>

02:09.755 --> 02:12.257
<i>We build up towers to watch them fall</i>

02:12.341 --> 02:14.343
<i>Ask questions and give it our all</i>

02:14.426 --> 02:17.262
<i>Runnin' experiments A fun experience</i>

02:17.346 --> 02:18.889
<i>Whoa</i>

02:19.598 --> 02:21.975
<i>The more we know The more we wanna know</i>

02:22.059 --> 02:25.270
<i>The more we know The more we wanna put our hands up</i>

02:25.354 --> 02:28.357
<i>Ask a question That's what school is for</i>

02:28.440 --> 02:33.111
<i>Every day we learn a little more Than we knew before</i>

02:33.195 --> 02:35.948
<i>Put your hands up Ask a question</i>

02:36.031 --> 02:38.033
<i>That's what school is for</i>

02:38.116 --> 02:40.494
<i>Put your hands up Put your hands up</i>

02:40.577 --> 02:42.454
<i>Every day we learn a little more</i>

02:42.538 --> 02:43.872
<i>That's what school is for</i>

02:44.915 --> 02:46.583
<i>That's what school is for</i>

02:48.293 --> 02:50.921
School is an entire place just for learning?

02:51.004 --> 02:52.506
Bot-tastic!

02:52.589 --> 02:54.716
But I still have a big question.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.802
How do you learn at school?

02:56.885 --> 03:00.347
Well, Doug, why don't you come with me and find out?

03:07.396 --> 03:10.482
Welcome to Mega City Elementary School, Doug.

03:11.316 --> 03:12.901
This is our classroom.

03:12.985 --> 03:15.028
These are our cubbies.

03:15.112 --> 03:17.114
Like my disco ball?

03:17.197 --> 03:19.867
These are our tables.

03:19.950 --> 03:23.245
And this is our Mr. Gilmore.

03:23.328 --> 03:24.705
Good morning, Emma.

03:24.788 --> 03:27.875
-You ready to learn more with Gilmore? -You know it.

03:27.958 --> 03:30.252
Mr. Gilmore, meet my best bot, Doug.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.337
He wanted to come to school with me today.

03:32.421 --> 03:34.882
He's really curious about it.

03:34.965 --> 03:37.593
Nice to learn your name, Mr. Gilmore.

03:37.676 --> 03:40.053
Doug! I think I speak for everyone

03:40.137 --> 03:42.347
when I say that we are thrilled you're here.

03:42.431 --> 03:45.017
-Hi. -Welcome to school, Doug.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.436
Um, hi, everybotty.

03:47.519 --> 03:50.063
Now why don't you tell us more about yourself?

03:50.147 --> 03:54.484
Well, I have a lot of big questions. That's why I wanted to come here today.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.862
I want to know how do you learn at school.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.989
Looks like you came to the right place,

03:59.072 --> 04:02.993
because as I always tell the class, with Mr. Gilmore, you can…

04:03.076 --> 04:04.745
Learn more!

04:04.828 --> 04:05.954
Now pull up a seat,

04:06.038 --> 04:08.415
and we'll kick off a little game I like to call,

04:08.498 --> 04:10.125
"Who can find the rain forest?"

04:10.209 --> 04:11.835
I cannot wait!

04:11.919 --> 04:13.545
That's what I like to hear.

04:13.629 --> 04:16.507
Okay, I'm gonna click through some pictures of different places,

04:16.589 --> 04:20.469
and you stop me when I get to the rain forest, okay? Here we go.

04:20.552 --> 04:23.347
Going forward, going forward. Okay, guys, what do we see here?

04:23.430 --> 04:26.016
Rain forests have monkeys, not monkey bars.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.310
Does this look like a rain forest? No?

04:28.393 --> 04:29.478
That's a mountain.

04:29.561 --> 04:31.605
What do you think? What do we think this is?

04:31.688 --> 04:32.940
Buildings are not trees.

04:33.023 --> 04:35.692
Getting hotter and hotter. Okay, that's too hot.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.028
A sandy rain forest? No way.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.112
Next.

04:39.196 --> 04:40.906
Oop-- No. That's my vacation.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.991
-Moving forward… -Look. Thick, green, leafy plants.

04:43.075 --> 04:43.992
Go back!

04:44.076 --> 04:46.245
You thought this might be a rain forest?

04:46.328 --> 04:48.163
-There it is! -Yes, that's it.

04:48.830 --> 04:51.375
Bingo! That is the rain forest.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.418
Good job, class. Guys, I'm proud of you.

04:53.502 --> 04:56.880
Wow. So now I know what it looks like in the rain forest.

04:56.964 --> 05:01.301
But I wonder, what does it sound like in the rain forest?

05:07.432 --> 05:08.642
Wow.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.644
This is what a rain forest sounds like?

05:10.727 --> 05:13.021
Those elephants are loud!

05:19.486 --> 05:21.572
When did we get confetti?

05:22.656 --> 05:24.950
Whoops. I didn't mean to interrupt the class.

05:25.534 --> 05:27.119
Don't worry about it, Doug.

05:27.202 --> 05:30.414
Now what do you say we take all this great energy

05:30.497 --> 05:33.584
and head on over to do some art?

05:33.667 --> 05:37.171
All right, class, who's ready to get those creative juices flowing?

05:37.254 --> 05:40.257
Uh-oh, juice? I brought coconut water.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.884
You do you, Thomas.

05:42.926 --> 05:44.761
Now, before we start painting,

05:44.845 --> 05:46.889
let's think about places where we feel happy.

05:46.972 --> 05:50.642
Tell me, everyone, where's your happy place?

05:51.727 --> 05:53.187
My ballet class.

05:53.270 --> 05:56.565
My kitchen, where there's coconut water!

05:57.482 --> 05:58.984
Rebots!

05:59.067 --> 06:00.652
Fantastic.

06:00.736 --> 06:03.197
Now, who wants to paint their happy place?

06:05.824 --> 06:07.576
I'll use my robo-paint tool.

06:08.452 --> 06:10.329
Something up, my shiny pal?

06:10.412 --> 06:13.790
It's just there's more colors in Rebots than this.

06:13.874 --> 06:18.378
I wonder, how can I paint Rebots with only red, yellow and blue?

06:19.546 --> 06:21.131
It's happening again!

06:21.882 --> 06:24.426
Quick, everyone, catch that paint!

06:27.221 --> 06:28.472
I got it!

06:31.266 --> 06:32.392
Look out!

06:36.063 --> 06:37.481
More confetti?

06:39.775 --> 06:43.779
Look. I think the yellow and blue paint mixed and made green.

06:43.862 --> 06:46.990
Who knew you can mix blue and red to make purple?

06:47.074 --> 06:48.742
Amazing.

06:48.825 --> 06:49.952
Not only that.

06:50.035 --> 06:53.121
Now this classroom is an even happier place,

06:53.205 --> 06:54.957
thanks to this awesome artwork.

06:55.040 --> 06:59.628
Wow. I had no idea you can learn so much by painting, but--

06:59.711 --> 07:02.714
Oh, no. I got paint everywhere.

07:02.798 --> 07:04.174
I got it.

07:04.258 --> 07:08.679
And now it's time for us all to head on over to the reading rug.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.556
I think you're really gonna like this.

07:10.639 --> 07:12.432
Doug, are you okay?

07:12.516 --> 07:15.352
Your robo-tools keep going robo-wild.

07:16.270 --> 07:18.230
It must be my wonder-ometer.

07:18.313 --> 07:22.359
Every time I wonder about something, it fills up, and my robo-tools go off.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.862
But you're curious about everything.

07:25.654 --> 07:27.155
Maybe I shouldn't stay.

07:27.239 --> 07:28.574
Are you kidding?

07:28.657 --> 07:31.702
You can't leave before you find out how we learn in school.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.203
So here's the plan.

07:33.287 --> 07:36.748
I'll keep an eye on your wonder-ometer so you don't have to be nervous

07:36.832 --> 07:38.917
and let you know if it goes up.

07:39.543 --> 07:40.586
Okay, class.

07:40.669 --> 07:43.547
Time for another space adventure.

07:43.630 --> 07:46.300
We're reading about an astronaut stuck on a new planet

07:46.383 --> 07:48.385
who doesn't know if he'll make it back home.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.929
We're not just reading it. We're gonna act it out too.

07:51.013 --> 07:53.265
Now, let's see. I know.

07:53.348 --> 07:55.767
Doug, how about you be an astronaut?

07:57.060 --> 07:58.270
Don't worry, Doug.

07:58.353 --> 08:00.564
I'll keep an eye on your wonder-ometer, remember?

08:01.273 --> 08:02.941
Okay. I'll do it!

08:03.942 --> 08:04.943
Doug! Doug!

08:05.027 --> 08:07.529
And, Gary, why don't you read for us?

08:07.613 --> 08:10.282
Gary would love to.

08:10.365 --> 08:13.535
"The astronaut bounced around the ground on the windy planet

08:13.619 --> 08:19.041
when suddenly noisy aliens appeared out of nowhere."

08:19.124 --> 08:21.210
Julie, Emma, Thomas, you could be the aliens.

08:21.293 --> 08:25.172
How do you think aliens might move and sound and feel?

08:26.423 --> 08:30.344
"Oh, no. Where did all these aliens come from?"

08:30.427 --> 08:33.304
-Where did they come from? -Out of nowhere.

08:33.388 --> 08:37.433
"The astronaut walked away as slowly and quietly as possible,

08:37.518 --> 08:41.688
pressing all of his buttons, trying to make his jet pack start again,

08:41.772 --> 08:43.315
but it just wouldn't work.

08:43.398 --> 08:47.277
The aliens kept coming closer and closer."

08:47.361 --> 08:50.030
"Oh, no. What do I do?"

08:50.113 --> 08:53.992
-What do I do? -I don't know, Doug. I'll keep reading.

08:54.076 --> 08:59.540
"Finally, the astronaut tried one last button, and…"

08:59.623 --> 09:01.959
I wonder if the astronaut gets to blast off!

09:02.960 --> 09:04.336
Uh-oh, Doug.

09:04.419 --> 09:07.339
Your wonder-ometer. Here it comes!

09:17.224 --> 09:19.476
Why does this classroom have so much confetti?

09:20.394 --> 09:22.688
A real astronaut!

09:24.398 --> 09:28.694
Wow! This must be what the astronaut felt like blasting around space.

09:28.777 --> 09:29.820
Amazing.

09:29.903 --> 09:32.573
But now I have so many more questions.

09:32.656 --> 09:35.450
Like, where was the astronaut from our story going?

09:35.534 --> 09:36.952
And what was he doing?

09:37.035 --> 09:39.788
And when it was lunch, what did the astronaut eat?

09:39.872 --> 09:41.290
I'm eating bologna.

09:41.373 --> 09:43.000
But what's bologna?

09:47.254 --> 09:50.632
Whew. You really committed to that astronaut role, Doug.

09:50.716 --> 09:54.761
I could feel the astronaut's excitement when you were zooming all around.

09:54.845 --> 09:55.888
Bravo.

09:55.971 --> 09:57.556
I was just so curious

09:57.639 --> 10:00.934
about how you can learn by acting out stories, and now I see.

10:01.018 --> 10:03.020
It really helped me feel like the astronaut.

10:03.103 --> 10:06.523
But maybe school isn't the place for me.

10:06.607 --> 10:09.735
Not if my wonder-ometer keeps going off.

10:09.818 --> 10:12.446
What? You can't go.

10:12.529 --> 10:14.406
-Yeah, don't leave now. -But, Doug, stay.

10:14.489 --> 10:16.116
-Don't leave. -You gotta stay, Doug.

10:16.200 --> 10:17.826
It doesn't compute.

10:17.910 --> 10:19.661
Why would you want me to stay

10:19.745 --> 10:23.415
when my wonder-ometer has been making it harder for everyone to learn?

10:23.498 --> 10:27.044
Doug, you haven't been making it harder for everyone to learn.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.963
-In fact, I think you helped. -I did?

10:30.047 --> 10:33.342
Yeah! I learned what it sounds like in the rain forest.

10:33.926 --> 10:37.471
And I learned that mixing yellow and red makes orange.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.765
And seeing you fly through the school,

10:39.848 --> 10:44.603
I learned it would be pretty hard for an alien to chase an astronaut.

10:44.686 --> 10:46.939
I guess it's thanks to my wonder-ometer

10:47.022 --> 10:49.358
that I just learned the answer to my big question.

10:49.441 --> 10:52.110
You can learn in school by wondering about things,

10:52.194 --> 10:54.613
being curious and asking questions.

10:54.696 --> 10:56.907
I'll tell you what I wonder.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.201
Are you gonna come back to school, Doug?

10:59.284 --> 11:00.911
You bot I will!

11:03.163 --> 11:06.083
Now I remember why we have all this confetti.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.876
To celebrate!

11:09.127 --> 11:13.048
Doug, I am so happy to hear you'll join our class from now on.

11:13.131 --> 11:17.177
With wonder and curiosity like yours, school is the perfect place for a bot.

11:18.345 --> 11:19.638
That gives me an idea.

11:19.721 --> 11:22.516
Let's go back to reading to see how the story ends!

11:22.599 --> 11:24.893
Great idea, Doug!

11:24.977 --> 11:26.812
Ah, what a class.

11:30.691 --> 11:32.901
Blue 42! Blue 42!

11:32.985 --> 11:34.570
Cleaning up litter on three.

11:37.698 --> 11:40.534
Into the reboot bin, soon-to-be-useful friend.

11:43.829 --> 11:44.955
Gary got ya!

11:45.038 --> 11:47.082
The score is tied with the clock running down.

11:47.165 --> 11:48.792
He takes the shot.

11:48.876 --> 11:53.463
Yes! And the crowd politely applauds.

11:53.547 --> 11:55.507
Great job, kids.

11:55.591 --> 11:58.218
Now we wait for bots to take the trash away

11:58.302 --> 12:01.180
so it can be rebooted into something useful.

12:01.263 --> 12:03.515
Did somebody say, "reboot"?

12:03.599 --> 12:06.518
Jenny, Doug. What a happy surprise.

12:06.602 --> 12:09.855
Sensors indicate we're happily surprised to see you too, Emma.

12:09.938 --> 12:12.566
What are you all doing in this empty lot?

12:12.649 --> 12:14.735
Great question, my shiny pal.

12:14.818 --> 12:16.153
We helped pick up trash

12:16.236 --> 12:18.447
so this place can be turned into something useful.

12:18.530 --> 12:22.117
Yeah! Like a home for a giant telescope.

12:22.201 --> 12:24.703
Or an outdoor dance studio.

12:24.786 --> 12:27.664
Or a museum for all Gary's toys.

12:27.748 --> 12:32.586
I'll call it the Metropolitan Museum of Gary's Stuff.

12:34.379 --> 12:37.883
This grass is super soft.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.887
And there sure is lots of room to play.

12:43.013 --> 12:46.975
I bet this lot would make the best playground.

12:47.059 --> 12:49.520
-What a wonderful idea. -What an idea.

12:49.603 --> 12:50.979
Sounds exciting.

12:51.063 --> 12:52.898
Only, what's a playground?

12:52.981 --> 12:57.110
Doug! You've never heard of a playground?

12:57.194 --> 13:00.072
Oh, wow. Oh, my. Oh, boy. Oh, geez.

13:00.155 --> 13:01.448
Doug, Doug, Doug.

13:01.532 --> 13:03.492
You gotta give it a plug, plug, plug.

13:05.285 --> 13:10.415
<i>Playgrounds are fun by design Sing it loud 'cause we're outside</i>

13:10.499 --> 13:13.335
<i>There's swings to swing And slides to slide</i>

13:13.418 --> 13:16.171
<i>A jungle gym with ropes to climb</i>

13:16.880 --> 13:19.049
<i>Merry-go-what? Seesaw up</i>

13:19.132 --> 13:21.343
<i>Monkey bars are kind of tough</i>

13:21.426 --> 13:23.971
<i>Have you had enough? No?</i>

13:24.054 --> 13:26.723
<i>Then let's go Let's go</i>

13:26.807 --> 13:29.726
<i>We go whoa Swing up, up, up</i>

13:29.810 --> 13:32.354
<i>Sing whee Spin round, round, round</i>

13:32.437 --> 13:35.148
<i>You'll see me high on top</i>

13:36.775 --> 13:38.360
<i>Rockin' the playground</i>

13:38.443 --> 13:40.612
<i>Whoa Swing up, up, up</i>

13:40.696 --> 13:43.532
<i>Sing whee Slide down, down, down</i>

13:43.615 --> 13:46.368
<i>You'll see me high on top</i>

13:46.451 --> 13:49.663
<i>Singing loud And rockin' the playground</i>

13:50.539 --> 13:52.666
<i>Rockin' the playground</i>

13:53.292 --> 13:54.293
I get it.

13:54.376 --> 13:56.712
A playground is a place designed for having fun.

13:56.795 --> 13:59.423
Only, I still have a big question.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.258
What makes the best playground?

14:01.341 --> 14:04.219
That's a big question, all right.

14:04.303 --> 14:06.013
You know what to do.

14:06.096 --> 14:08.140
Unplug and find out!

14:08.223 --> 14:10.475
All right, volunteers.

14:10.559 --> 14:14.730
To thank you for a job well done, Barb and I would like to treat you to…

14:14.813 --> 14:16.356
Lunch.

14:16.982 --> 14:18.066
Sounds tasty!

14:18.150 --> 14:20.986
Maybe we can find the answer after lunch.

14:21.820 --> 14:23.530
Care to join us, Doug?

14:23.614 --> 14:26.825
Thanks, Barb, but we're gonna bring these bins back to Rebots.

14:26.909 --> 14:28.702
Plus, I have an idea.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.370
Okay, then. See you soon.

14:30.454 --> 14:31.705
Bye!

14:31.788 --> 14:33.290
An idea, hey?

14:33.373 --> 14:35.667
Well, lay it on me, Dougster.

14:35.751 --> 14:38.670
Emma said this lot would make a great playground.

14:38.754 --> 14:41.882
So I thought we could give them another happy surprise

14:41.965 --> 14:44.051
by rebooting the empty lot…

14:44.134 --> 14:45.552
Into a playground!

14:45.636 --> 14:48.889
What a bot-tastic idea, Doug-o!

14:48.972 --> 14:50.766
I'll take these bins back to Rebots

14:50.849 --> 14:53.477
and be back with some robo-helpers in a robo-flash.

14:54.686 --> 14:58.065
Thank you for coming, bots. We're gonna reboot this empty lot

14:58.148 --> 15:00.984
into the best playground our human friends have ever seen.

15:02.444 --> 15:03.820
You said it, my bot.

15:03.904 --> 15:06.031
Hi. Hello. Safety Bot here.

15:06.114 --> 15:08.867
I'm sure we're all very excited.

15:08.951 --> 15:10.202
Just, what's a playground?

15:11.203 --> 15:12.871
This is a playground.

15:12.955 --> 15:16.750
Scanners indicate it's a place specifically designed for having fun.

15:18.126 --> 15:20.420
We bots are great at making things.

15:20.504 --> 15:22.214
With our robo know-how,

15:22.297 --> 15:25.634
we'll design the best playground in no time.

15:25.717 --> 15:28.971
-Yeah! -Ready, set, reboot!

16:06.800 --> 16:08.385
Great rebooting, bots.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.387
I'll go get our friends.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.598
Three, two, one.

16:12.681 --> 16:15.475
Surprise, human children!

16:15.559 --> 16:18.979
Doug, is that what I think it is?

16:19.062 --> 16:21.398
If you think it's a playground, affirmative.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.984
We designed it to be the best.

16:24.067 --> 16:27.487
-What should we do first? -The sandbox sure looks fun.

16:28.947 --> 16:31.450
Okay, what's that?

16:31.992 --> 16:34.953
Hold up. This isn't a sandbox.

16:35.037 --> 16:37.206
It's a gearbox.

16:37.289 --> 16:38.540
Oh, yes indeed-y.

16:38.624 --> 16:41.001
We took the basic sandbox design--

16:42.002 --> 16:45.047
And upgraded it. What could be better than gears?

16:46.215 --> 16:47.424
Is everything okay?

16:48.008 --> 16:53.180
It's just a box on a playground is usually full of sand,

16:53.263 --> 16:57.935
so when you play in it, you can dig and mold and pour it into stuff.

16:59.061 --> 17:02.189
It's so heavy.

17:02.773 --> 17:05.400
Fiddle forks. We didn't realize.

17:05.483 --> 17:08.694
-Sorry, kids. -Don't worry, Mr. Forkrick.

17:08.779 --> 17:11.906
Looks like there are still plenty of things

17:11.990 --> 17:14.785
on this shiny new playground to enjoy.

17:14.867 --> 17:15.911
There sure are.

17:17.454 --> 17:21.708
As you can see, kids, I personally designed these swings

17:21.791 --> 17:23.502
to be as enjoyable as possible.

17:23.585 --> 17:24.837
Yes, sirree, bot.

17:24.920 --> 17:28.464
If you can find a better design, I'd sure like to download it.

17:30.968 --> 17:33.387
Come on, everybotty. Give it a try.

17:34.888 --> 17:36.223
Gary's not reaching it.

17:37.558 --> 17:41.144
I guess I designed this piece of equipment for extendo-limbs.

17:41.228 --> 17:44.690
Does that mean kids can't have fun on the robo-swings?

17:44.773 --> 17:46.400
I'm afraid so, buddy-bot.

17:46.483 --> 17:49.111
Uh-oh. But don't worry, everybotty.

17:49.194 --> 17:52.114
We designed something else that you'll definitely enjoy.

17:52.197 --> 17:55.158
-The monkey bars! -Monkey bars!

17:55.242 --> 17:57.160
Roll right up to the most fun

17:57.244 --> 18:01.415
and most, most, most safe piece of playground equipment around.

18:02.791 --> 18:05.377
But there's only one.

18:05.460 --> 18:08.255
Exactly. That's what makes it so safe.

18:08.338 --> 18:10.716
Moving around on six bars? Ha!

18:10.799 --> 18:12.176
Not on my watch.

18:12.259 --> 18:13.677
Go on. Give it a try.

18:15.387 --> 18:17.389
Isn't that fun, small human?

18:17.890 --> 18:19.600
Well, it is safe.

18:19.683 --> 18:23.687
But monkey bars are fun because you can swing along a bunch of bars

18:23.770 --> 18:24.938
to the other side.

18:25.022 --> 18:26.732
You can't do that with one bar.

18:26.815 --> 18:29.860
Does that mean you can't have fun on the monkey bars either?

18:29.943 --> 18:31.528
It's okay, buddy-bot.

18:31.612 --> 18:35.199
Hey, is that an epic slide I see?

18:37.659 --> 18:41.038
Prepare for maximum levels of enjoyment!

18:41.788 --> 18:43.540
Yeah, the slide!

18:43.624 --> 18:45.209
Hey, kiddo,

18:45.292 --> 18:48.462
check out our drone-designed robo-turbo super slide.

18:48.545 --> 18:50.839
Head on up and give it a ride!

18:52.591 --> 18:53.675
Where's the ladder?

18:54.635 --> 18:57.679
-Ladder? -Yeah. We're kids.

18:57.763 --> 19:00.557
We can't hover up there like you drones.

19:01.558 --> 19:03.602
Yeah. Guess we didn't process that.

19:03.685 --> 19:06.939
We thought we were making the best playground ever,

19:07.022 --> 19:10.150
but we designed it for bot fun, not kid fun.

19:11.235 --> 19:12.569
That's okay, bots.

19:12.653 --> 19:15.322
We really appreciate how much you tried.

19:15.405 --> 19:19.868
Yeah. I just wish there was something we could do so we can play on it.

19:19.952 --> 19:23.747
Redo it, make it so it's different. What's the word?

19:23.830 --> 19:25.165
Reboot!

19:25.249 --> 19:26.416
That's it!

19:26.500 --> 19:29.378
Come on, bots. Playground reboot, activate.

19:33.882 --> 19:37.302
-How's the new sandbox treating you, Gary? -Gary loves it.

19:38.470 --> 19:39.972
Enjoying the swings, Julie?

19:40.055 --> 19:41.598
They're kid perfect.

19:43.475 --> 19:45.853
Hey, Thomas. Monkeying around efficiently?

19:45.936 --> 19:49.314
Yeah! It's so much fun with all these bars to swing on.

19:49.398 --> 19:50.858
Can't look.

19:54.570 --> 19:56.196
Let's do this.

20:00.659 --> 20:03.537
Scanners indicate the new slide design is working too.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.330
Yes, sirree, bot.

20:05.414 --> 20:08.625
And you better look out, 'cause I'm going again.

20:08.709 --> 20:10.335
Mission accomplished, bots.

20:10.419 --> 20:13.088
Maximum enjoyment is being achieved.

20:13.172 --> 20:15.424
This is the best!

20:16.592 --> 20:20.053
The only thing that can make it better is if you bots play too.

20:24.641 --> 20:29.688
On second thought, I'm not sure all this sand is good for my gears.

20:32.900 --> 20:34.484
Not maximum fun.

20:39.656 --> 20:40.782
Not safe.

20:47.998 --> 20:49.666
Emma, what's wrong?

20:49.750 --> 20:51.293
I thought you were having fun.

20:51.376 --> 20:52.377
We were.

20:52.461 --> 20:55.297
We thought this playground was the best.

20:55.380 --> 20:58.509
But now you bots can't play.

21:00.302 --> 21:01.470
I just don't get it.

21:01.553 --> 21:04.890
Our collected data indicated you kids would really enjoy this.

21:04.973 --> 21:06.058
We did.

21:06.141 --> 21:09.186
But it's not as much fun as when we're playing together.

21:09.895 --> 21:10.896
That's it, Emma.

21:10.979 --> 21:14.191
We should design the playground so everyone can play together.

21:14.274 --> 21:17.486
Doug, you robo-genius.

21:17.569 --> 21:20.239
Let's do it! Ready, set…

21:20.322 --> 21:21.823
Re-reboot!

21:25.619 --> 21:29.289
Now this is what I call maximum fun.

21:29.373 --> 21:32.459
It's so much better now that we can all play.

21:32.543 --> 21:33.544
Yeah.

21:33.627 --> 21:36.630
First, we designed the playground so we bots could play.

21:36.713 --> 21:38.674
Then we designed it so kids could play.

21:38.757 --> 21:41.468
But now that it's designed so we can all play together,

21:41.552 --> 21:43.554
this playground is…

21:43.637 --> 21:44.972
The best!

21:45.055 --> 21:48.851
And I think I finally discovered the answer to my big question.

21:48.934 --> 21:52.563
The best playground is one that everyone can enjoy together.

21:52.646 --> 21:53.939
Wait a nanosecond.

21:54.022 --> 21:55.440
That gives me another idea.

21:56.191 --> 22:00.946
Come one, come all to the most bot-tastically fun place around.

22:01.029 --> 22:05.826
The brand-new Mega City community playground!

22:19.214 --> 22:23.177
Well, buddy-bot, we sure have had a lot of fun.

22:23.260 --> 22:24.761
Affirmative, best friend Emma.

22:24.845 --> 22:26.346
And I can't wait to find out

22:26.430 --> 22:29.224
what other big questions there are to answer together.

22:29.308 --> 22:30.684
Me too, Doug.

22:30.767 --> 22:33.228
But first, let's play!
