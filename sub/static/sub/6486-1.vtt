01:13.490 --> 01:16.909
We hereby commend
our brother to you, Lord.

01:16.993 --> 01:19.870
And so it remains
that Matthew Cordell...

01:19.954 --> 01:22.623
can now live on
in your eternal presence.

01:32.509 --> 01:35.427
We cannot sit in judgment
ofthis man...

01:35.512 --> 01:38.597
any more than we might sit
in judgment ofthose responsible...

01:38.681 --> 01:41.475
for his false imprisonment
and untimely demise.

01:48.024 --> 01:49.942
In your mercy and love,

01:50.026 --> 01:52.694
please forgive whatever sins
he may have committed...

01:52.779 --> 01:54.279
through human weakness.

07:15.184 --> 07:16.852
Hey, Mac.

07:16.936 --> 07:20.605
Aren't you supposed to be off
at some political bullshit function?

07:20.690 --> 07:23.191
That's right.
I'm just warming up.

07:26.612 --> 07:29.448
So what's with the no headgear?

07:29.532 --> 07:31.867
I love the sound of gunfire.

07:42.420 --> 07:44.504
Why aren't you out celebrating?

07:44.589 --> 07:46.548
Don't feel like it.

07:46.632 --> 07:49.301
Go out, for Christ's sake.
It's your birthday.

07:49.385 --> 07:51.303
Have some fun.
Go to a movie.

07:51.387 --> 07:55.140
Anything but standing
around here and shooting
at anonymous bad guys all night.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.894
Maybe they're
not so anonymous to me.

08:05.860 --> 08:07.652
Anybody I know?

08:07.737 --> 08:09.237
Yeah, maybe.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.323
Hank Cooney
from the mayor's office.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.535
What's the problem?

08:17.497 --> 08:20.499
He's calling me into deposition
to answer another citizen complaint.

08:28.883 --> 08:30.675
Excessive force?

08:30.760 --> 08:33.886
Seems to be
the popular complaint these days.

08:33.971 --> 08:35.764
Broke the bastard's cheekbone.

08:35.847 --> 08:37.557
What was the charge?

08:38.433 --> 08:40.352
Attempted rape.

08:42.938 --> 08:45.148
Next time wait a little longer.

08:50.112 --> 08:53.031
Then you can kill the bastard.

09:03.668 --> 09:05.335
Hollow-points, huh?

09:06.504 --> 09:08.964
Where accuracy
is never a problem.

09:09.048 --> 09:11.633
Well, you know they are
calling me Maniac Kate.

09:11.717 --> 09:13.969
I wouldn't consider that
a compliment.

09:15.429 --> 09:17.931
Hey, Mac, I'll see you later.

09:18.057 --> 09:20.517
What?
Happy birthday, kid.

09:20.601 --> 09:22.143
You crazy-

09:30.820 --> 09:32.946
Hey, Mac, I love it.

10:49.231 --> 10:52.108
Down at the end ofthe alley!

10:52.193 --> 10:54.194
Get those bums
out ofthere!

11:05.956 --> 11:09.084
We need some more
over here!

11:12.505 --> 11:14.923
Mac. Down here.
Hey, Lieutenant.

11:22.848 --> 11:24.724
Watch your step.

11:24.850 --> 11:27.769
Sorry I had to call you
out ofthe function.
You did me a favor, Leo.

11:27.853 --> 11:30.855
Yeah, we'll see.
It's some gruesome shit.

11:45.121 --> 11:47.288
At least he died
with a smile on his face.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.958
Very funny, Leo.

12:15.526 --> 12:18.236
Lieutenant!
Newshounds are here.

12:23.117 --> 12:25.285
Shit.

12:29.290 --> 12:32.417
Yeah, it's McKinney.
Should be good with him here.

12:32.501 --> 12:34.586
What is it?
What you got?
Homeless guy.

12:34.670 --> 12:36.546
Well, how 'bout an angle,
McKinney?

12:36.672 --> 12:38.214
You want an angle?
Yeah.

12:38.340 --> 12:42.177
How about 180 degrees?
Come on, man.
Give me a break. Huh?

12:42.261 --> 12:45.263
It's a routine O.D.
You wanna check it out, go ahead.

12:45.347 --> 12:50.101
But ifyou were smart,
you'd go down to 29th and Park.
We got a jumper.

12:50.186 --> 12:52.771
You're an angel.
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

13:12.833 --> 13:15.168
See what you get? Huh?

13:15.878 --> 13:17.545
Fucking McKinney.

13:17.630 --> 13:21.049
That son ofa bitch.
He really gave us the shaft,
that prick.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.009
I knew there was nojumper.
I knew it.

13:23.135 --> 13:26.262
Couldn't you tell
he was trying to get rid of us?
What else we got?

13:26.388 --> 13:28.807
Okay, let's see what we got.

13:28.891 --> 13:30.517
We got a bomb scare.

13:30.601 --> 13:32.352
Long Island City and Kennedy Airport.

13:32.478 --> 13:35.772
- Maybe we could string
the both ofthem together.
- No, they always turn out to be duds.

13:35.898 --> 13:38.483
What else?
Drug-related homicide, SoHo.

13:38.567 --> 13:41.486
Nah, that's no good.
Wait a minute. Is it a kid?

13:42.905 --> 13:44.906
Black male, 18 to 25.

13:45.032 --> 13:49.118
Couldn't be
a fucking Irishman or a fucking Greek?
Don't they get high on drugs?

13:49.203 --> 13:50.954
Next! Next!

13:51.080 --> 13:53.957
Got a four-alarm fire
in Brooklyn.
Forget about it.

13:54.041 --> 13:56.000
- Wait, wait. This is big.
- Come on.

13:56.085 --> 13:59.546
The networks won't even consider it
unless there's at least three confirmed dead.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.714
It's a warehouse.
A fucking mattress warehouse.

14:01.799 --> 14:03.174
Forget it!

14:03.259 --> 14:05.009
Fuckin' somethin' better happen.

14:05.094 --> 14:08.012
What are you doing?

14:08.097 --> 14:11.933
Praying to the news gods
to grant usjust one good misfortune.

14:13.102 --> 14:16.187
So, Mac,
we gonna chalk this up
as a routine O.D., huh?

14:16.272 --> 14:18.690
Well, let me ask you something.
What do you think?

14:18.774 --> 14:22.402
Did they stuffthe chicken
down this guy's throat
before he O.D.'d or after?

14:24.405 --> 14:26.447
It's Palo Mayombe.

14:26.532 --> 14:29.242
You're not thinking
about food now, are you?

14:30.202 --> 14:32.120
It's a spin-offofSanteria.

14:32.204 --> 14:34.664
They use the heads for their rituals.

14:34.748 --> 14:37.250
How do you know
about this occult shit?

14:37.334 --> 14:40.253
Ever since Cordell,
it's been an interest of mine.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.798
They whacked this poor bastard
for his head?

14:43.883 --> 14:45.508
No, they probably
found him dead.

14:45.593 --> 14:48.511
Theyjust got there
before we did.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.555
So how does the bird play in this?

14:50.639 --> 14:54.309
It's a courtesy to the stiff.

14:55.311 --> 14:57.186
It allows the soul to take flight.

14:57.313 --> 14:59.397
Does it hurt? Does it hurt?

15:02.985 --> 15:06.529
This is Sullivan, 1084. Arrived at scene.
Cannot determine extent ofactivity inside.

15:06.614 --> 15:08.615
Are now entering to investigate.
Over and out.

15:09.617 --> 15:11.618
God!

15:11.702 --> 15:13.786
Come on! Next!

15:17.333 --> 15:18.917
Son ofa bitch!

15:19.001 --> 15:22.045
We got us a shooter.

15:22.129 --> 15:24.172
Officer Kate Sullivan?

15:24.840 --> 15:28.301
Oh, that's beautiful.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.904
I'll kill you all.
I'll kill all you fucking bastards.

15:49.490 --> 15:52.450
Come on! Come on!
Who's next? Huh?

15:52.534 --> 15:54.953
How does it feel?
Does it hurt?

15:55.037 --> 15:58.331
Does it hurt?
Come on! Who's next?

16:15.265 --> 16:17.392
Shoot me now, bitch!

16:18.727 --> 16:21.729
Go ahead! I dare you!
You want to see her brains?

16:21.814 --> 16:22.981
Huh?

16:23.065 --> 16:26.401
Why don't you come back here
and give me a smooch?

16:27.361 --> 16:30.405
Get out of my way!
What the hell is wrong with you,
you stupid jerk?

16:30.489 --> 16:33.157
The head...

16:33.242 --> 16:36.869
carries the spirit.

16:38.372 --> 16:40.456
The heart...

16:40.541 --> 16:43.501
carries the soul.

16:43.585 --> 16:46.170
A head with no heart...

16:46.255 --> 16:49.757
is a spirit with no soul.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.725
Did you see what went down here?

17:00.561 --> 17:03.271
I see whatyou see.

17:07.984 --> 17:09.902
I saw a symbol...

17:10.904 --> 17:13.114
in the dirt.

17:13.198 --> 17:14.906
Two triangles...

17:15.701 --> 17:17.827
facing each other across a line.

17:17.911 --> 17:19.412
You see...

17:19.496 --> 17:24.041
the symbol ofanti-justice.

17:31.633 --> 17:33.509
You can't touch me!

17:34.720 --> 17:37.597
Stick with him.
Stick with him.
I got him. I got him.

17:43.270 --> 17:45.438
You can't touch me!

17:46.315 --> 17:49.525
No fuckin' Valium?
Give me a fuckin' break!

17:58.494 --> 18:01.662
All right, where's the good stuff?

18:02.414 --> 18:06.042
This is nothin'!
Just fuckin' glorified aspirin shit!

18:07.419 --> 18:09.629
Oh, yeah.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.930
Oh, fuck! Dilaudid!

18:26.605 --> 18:28.356
This filthy creep's
gonna make us rich.

18:33.195 --> 18:34.862
Oh, man.

18:48.377 --> 18:50.044
Hey, look.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.838
Hey, we're on TV.

18:51.922 --> 18:53.464
Wave- Hi, Mom.

18:59.471 --> 19:01.097
Drop the gun!

19:01.181 --> 19:03.307
You look like
you could use some downers.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.184
This'll be
on the world news tomorrow.

19:05.269 --> 19:07.311
Go ahead.

19:07.396 --> 19:08.980
Help yourself.

19:09.064 --> 19:11.607
- Let the kid go.
- No.

19:11.733 --> 19:14.652
I don't want to.
I'll give you a count of 10.

19:14.736 --> 19:17.238
Oh, is that what
you're gonna do? Huh?

19:17.322 --> 19:18.823
One.

19:18.907 --> 19:20.158
Two.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.034
Three.

19:22.119 --> 19:25.663
Lady, you can't hurt me,

19:25.747 --> 19:27.331
'cause I'm immortal.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.917
- Look at this sick bastard.
- Four.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.338
But she's not.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.849
You shot him.
Calm down.

19:44.933 --> 19:47.894
Backup's on its way.
Calm down.

19:49.438 --> 19:52.106
You shot Frank.
- You buzzed him in.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.410
I'm buying a new foreign car.

20:28.977 --> 20:31.103
She's got a pulse.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.022
It's fading.
How bad is she?

20:33.148 --> 20:35.107
You know her religion?
Catholic.

20:35.192 --> 20:37.026
Get a priest.

20:37.110 --> 20:39.111
I'm losing her.

20:40.530 --> 20:42.657
Pulse is 32.

21:02.719 --> 21:05.346
Oh, Sean.

21:05.430 --> 21:07.515
Mrs. Sullivan.

21:08.809 --> 21:10.726
What's happening to my baby?

21:10.811 --> 21:12.728
She was involved in a shooting.

21:12.813 --> 21:14.355
The police brought me here.

21:14.439 --> 21:18.150
They said something about a chest wound,
but nobody tells me how bad it is.

21:18.235 --> 21:20.278
Well, they don't knowyet, Mrs. Sullivan.

21:21.154 --> 21:22.905
You've always been her protector.

21:22.990 --> 21:25.283
Please make sure
she gets the best ofcare.

21:25.367 --> 21:28.536
Mrs. Sullivan,
I have some important papers
foryou to sign.

21:29.705 --> 21:33.291
Ifthe Lord calls her,
make sure they let her go to him.

21:35.544 --> 21:38.629
I promise.
Please, Mrs. Sullivan.

22:02.279 --> 22:05.072
Mr.Jenner to Admitting.

22:05.157 --> 22:07.074
Mr.Jenner to Admitting.

22:11.747 --> 22:13.456
Lieutenant McKinney?
Yeah.

22:13.540 --> 22:16.834
Would you like to wait upstairs?
I think you'd be more
comfortable up there.

22:16.918 --> 22:18.461
Yeah. Thanks.

22:39.316 --> 22:44.195
You are the first cop
to walk these streets in a long time.

22:47.032 --> 22:49.825
These are dark days, my friend.

22:49.910 --> 22:53.704
I need your very special
kind ofdarkness.

23:01.129 --> 23:03.881
You want to kill me...

23:03.965 --> 23:07.551
because I'm the one
responsible foryour resurrection.

23:08.970 --> 23:11.722
But understand,

23:11.807 --> 23:15.559
I could not have brought you back
unless you allowed it.

23:16.645 --> 23:21.399
Even I cannot overcome
the will ofa spirit at rest.

23:23.402 --> 23:26.904
And your spirit will never be at rest,

23:26.988 --> 23:28.989
will it, Officer Cordell?

23:41.336 --> 23:45.005
I ain't afraid ofthe gangsters out there.
It's the cops. I'm afraid ofthe cops.

23:45.090 --> 23:47.925
They're psycho, man,
every last one ofthem.

23:48.009 --> 23:50.052
Check this out.
Uh, that Kate Sullivan?

23:50.137 --> 23:53.848
She kills the hostage
and the perpetrator lives.
I mean, what is this? Iraq?

23:54.015 --> 23:56.308
City officials are concerned over recent-

23:56.393 --> 23:59.645
Kate's lucky.
Myerson's on duty tonight.

24:00.939 --> 24:02.606
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

24:03.525 --> 24:05.276
What makes her lucky?

24:05.360 --> 24:08.070
He's top ofthe line in trauma.

24:08.155 --> 24:10.072
Well, I hope so.

24:10.157 --> 24:12.575
I oughta know.
I put him through med school.

24:12.659 --> 24:15.369
Please call the authorities.
Let's go live now-

24:15.495 --> 24:18.456
I hope it wasn't
a correspondence course.

24:18.540 --> 24:23.127
I'm standing outside LaRue's Pharmacy
at 1 25th Street and Lexington...

24:23.211 --> 24:27.131
during an event which can only be
described as a black rainbow ofterror.

24:27.215 --> 24:31.760
What began as a routine burglary call
ended in a gruesome tragedy earlier tonight...

24:31.845 --> 24:36.891
as a 1 9-year-old pharmacist's assistant
was brutally shot dead by police.

24:36.975 --> 24:40.895
News cameras were on the scene
with this shocking footage.

24:40.979 --> 24:42.855
Get out of my way!

24:42.939 --> 24:45.983
In what could be
the most chilling example of its kind,

24:46.067 --> 24:50.321
Officer Kate Sullivan is seen here
shooting both hostage and suspect...

24:50.405 --> 24:52.323
with no apparent regard
for innocent life.

24:52.407 --> 24:54.325
That's bullshit.

24:54.451 --> 24:58.579
Ifyou call 911 and Domino's,
we all know who's gonna get there first. Right?

24:58.663 --> 25:00.998
I feel safer with a pizza.
You know what I mean?

25:01.082 --> 25:03.709
While the suspect, FrankJessup,
is recovering...

25:03.793 --> 25:06.712
in the lockup ward
at Queen of Mercy Hospital,

25:06.796 --> 25:10.174
at the center ofthe controversy,
and fighting for her own life,

25:10.258 --> 25:13.260
is Officer Kate Sullivan,
a six-year veteran,

25:13.345 --> 25:17.264
well known among her colleagues
as fearless, opinionated and brash.

25:17.349 --> 25:21.101
In recent months she'd earned
the nickname Maniac Kate,

25:21.186 --> 25:24.104
a nod to another cop
with a knack for overkill.

25:24.189 --> 25:28.609
A police spokesman stated that
an Internal Affairs investigation has been initiated.

25:28.693 --> 25:30.277
But for this young pharmacist,

25:30.362 --> 25:32.196
the last prescription she filled...

25:32.280 --> 25:35.074
was the bitter pill offate.

25:35.158 --> 25:36.700
Son ofa bitches.

25:41.206 --> 25:42.957
Where can I find Katie?

25:43.041 --> 25:44.458
Seventh floor O.R.

25:45.752 --> 25:47.211
Thanks.

25:47.295 --> 25:50.130
New "Buy American" plan
isjust the deal-

25:50.215 --> 25:52.883
I'm at Customs in Mexico City.

25:52.968 --> 25:55.344
This guy says to me,
"You got anything to declare?"

25:55.428 --> 25:59.014
I said, "Yeah. I can't focus my eyes,
and it burns when I urinate."

25:59.140 --> 26:00.849
Oh, man.
Can I help you?

26:00.934 --> 26:03.477
Yeah, I'm looking for
a Dr. Myerson.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.062
Who are you?

26:05.146 --> 26:06.730
Lieutenant McKinney.

26:06.815 --> 26:09.149
Well, I'm Myerson.

26:10.235 --> 26:12.319
Can you tell me the status
of Officer Sullivan?

26:14.531 --> 26:16.448
She's alive.

26:17.492 --> 26:20.327
Can you be
a little more specific?

26:20.829 --> 26:22.329
Reticular formation's intact.

26:23.248 --> 26:26.083
- She's got primary cerebral cortex-
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey. Hey.

26:26.167 --> 26:28.252
I'm a cop, not a doctor.

26:28.336 --> 26:31.171
She can respirate and eliminate.

26:32.924 --> 26:36.051
You're telling me
she's brain-dead?
Yeah.

26:38.847 --> 26:40.514
What's the prognosis?

26:40.599 --> 26:43.434
Stick her in a rock garden.

26:44.519 --> 26:46.687
I don't like your sense of humor.

26:48.815 --> 26:50.816
Help these people.

28:22.742 --> 28:24.827
Hey, that cop's up there, right?

28:25.704 --> 28:28.997
You know,
the one that shot the hostage.

28:29.082 --> 28:30.874
Kate, uh-

28:30.959 --> 28:32.793
What's her name?

28:35.296 --> 28:36.797
Ask me,
she had it coming.

28:36.881 --> 28:39.675
About time you guys figured out
this ain't the Wild West, pal.

28:39.759 --> 28:42.886
Bunch ofcowboys.

28:42.971 --> 28:47.766
Yeah, that's it.Just a bunch offunny cowboys.
Hi-ho, Silver.

29:23.511 --> 29:27.765
So, how bad is the stench
down at the halls ofjustice these days, William?

29:27.849 --> 29:29.558
Oh, pretty bad.

29:30.226 --> 29:34.897
Um, look, um, don't tell anybody
where you got this from.

29:37.317 --> 29:39.234
I never do.

29:39.319 --> 29:43.322
The city is gonna roll over
on this case, big time.

29:43.406 --> 29:46.742
Scumbag, he's already got himselfa lawyer.
Now he's suing us.

29:46.826 --> 29:51.288
So let him sue. He's a hopped-upjunkie.
Nobody's gonna take him seriously.

29:51.372 --> 29:54.124
Somebody already has.
He's got himselfa case, Mac.

29:54.209 --> 29:57.878
Your friend Kate,
she had herselfan automatic drop gun.

29:57.962 --> 30:00.255
Hollow-points in a service revolver?
Come on.

30:00.381 --> 30:03.300
For Christ's sake, Willie,
you've been on the streets.
Every hitter out there's got that and more.

30:03.384 --> 30:06.595
What are we supposed to
fight them back with? Pop guns?

30:06.679 --> 30:08.722
Don't matter.

30:08.807 --> 30:11.517
Those are illegal weapons.
Cops can't use them.

30:11.601 --> 30:14.686
You know that, I know that,
she knows that, scumbag knows that.

30:14.771 --> 30:18.315
That's why he's suing the city for 10 mil
for each slug we pull out of his sorry ass.

30:18.399 --> 30:21.151
Which, at this point,
I think it's up to three.

30:21.236 --> 30:23.695
What kind ofdeal are they gonna cut him?

30:30.328 --> 30:33.121
Six months, suspended sentence,

30:34.123 --> 30:37.584
in exchange for him
dropping his suit against the city.

30:38.545 --> 30:40.921
What's that do to Katie?

30:41.840 --> 30:45.008
Just pray your friend doesn't wake up.

31:00.942 --> 31:02.526
Step back.

31:06.072 --> 31:07.614
Thanks.

31:11.995 --> 31:17.374
Couple ofsquirts of morphine
in my I.V. drip there, huh, beautiful?

31:17.458 --> 31:22.045
We wouldn't want to turn you into an addict,
now would we, Mr.Jessup?

31:22.130 --> 31:25.507
Oh, my mind would be
a terrible thing to waste.

31:25.592 --> 31:27.801
Excuse me. Dr. Fowler?

31:27.886 --> 31:29.553
Hi.

31:29.637 --> 31:33.724
- Can I help you with something?
- Yeah. I'd, uh- I'd like a minute.

31:33.808 --> 31:35.350
I'm sorry.
I don't have the time right now.

31:35.476 --> 31:38.270
No,
I mean with the patient.
Oh.

31:38.354 --> 31:40.814
Uh, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

31:42.150 --> 31:44.401
I just need to ask him
a couple ofquestions.

31:44.485 --> 31:47.446
- Can I have one minute?
- One minute?

31:47.530 --> 31:49.072
Please.

31:50.074 --> 31:51.700
Okay.
Thankyou.

31:58.166 --> 32:00.792
I told the story to your friends.

32:01.794 --> 32:05.631
Well, you know what?
I don't want the story. I want the truth.

32:08.259 --> 32:10.469
Then you can wait
for my memoirs.

32:10.553 --> 32:13.305
Shh.

32:17.018 --> 32:19.019
I'd rather not wait that long.

32:19.103 --> 32:20.812
Now...

32:22.690 --> 32:25.442
I didn't know that girl Terry,

32:25.526 --> 32:27.361
but I do know the officer,

32:27.445 --> 32:30.781
and I know that when she puts a slug
between somebody's eyes,

32:30.865 --> 32:32.157
it belongs there.

32:32.283 --> 32:34.701
Now, I want you
to mull this over. Okay?

32:34.786 --> 32:37.871
I want you to think about it.
You don't have to answer me now.

32:37.956 --> 32:40.874
But are you sure
there isn't anything else?
I want you to tell me. All right?

32:40.959 --> 32:44.044
Maybe there's something else
you forgot to tell the other detectives.

32:44.128 --> 32:46.338
Think about that.

32:47.340 --> 32:49.383
What's going on in here?

32:49.467 --> 32:50.884
I didn't see nothin'.

32:51.552 --> 32:54.513
It's terrible when you have
an itch you can't scratch.

33:04.983 --> 33:07.818
Lieutenant McKinney.

33:07.902 --> 33:09.569
What went on in there?

33:09.696 --> 33:13.448
We had a little chat.
I have a feeling if it had been a big chat,
he'd be dead right now.

33:13.574 --> 33:16.451
Are you assigned to this case?
No, not officially.

33:16.577 --> 33:20.455
Then I'm gonna have to askyou
to stay away from my patient.
Look, Dr. Fowler.

33:20.540 --> 33:22.666
Take him in here.
Come on.

33:22.750 --> 33:25.877
Maybe I stepped
out of line back there.
I don't know anymore.

33:27.505 --> 33:30.132
But Katie is-

33:30.216 --> 33:32.592
Well, she's like a kid sister to me.

33:34.429 --> 33:36.430
Please try and understand that.

36:06.956 --> 36:09.124
Nurse.

36:10.376 --> 36:12.335
Nurse!

36:15.965 --> 36:19.926
Nurse, there's some kind of reaction
from Kate Sullivan. Dr. Fowler.

36:33.065 --> 36:35.108
I don't see any change.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.068
Her eyes were open.

36:40.740 --> 36:43.491
- You sure?
- I know what I saw.

36:43.576 --> 36:46.494
That monitor was going crazy.

36:46.579 --> 36:48.788
Well, there's nothing there now.

36:53.753 --> 36:56.463
She grabbed my hand, like this.

36:59.842 --> 37:02.636
- I'll go tell Dr. Myerson.
- You can't do that.

37:04.263 --> 37:07.182
If he knows it comes from me,
he won't lift a finger.

37:07.266 --> 37:09.142
Then he won't know.

37:16.651 --> 37:19.069
Can you page Dr. Myerson,
please?

37:19.153 --> 37:20.987
Dr. Fowler.

37:21.906 --> 37:24.866
So how come
you're so willing to believe me?

37:24.992 --> 37:29.204
Because you don't strike me
as the kind of man with much imagination,
Lieutenant McKinney.

37:30.539 --> 37:31.957
Thanks.

37:32.041 --> 37:34.751
Close him up.
Count the sponges.

37:36.879 --> 37:38.546
Hello, gorgeous.

37:38.673 --> 37:41.675
I just came
from Kate Sullivan's room.
Mmm.

37:41.801 --> 37:43.927
Chest wound.
Mm-hmm.

37:45.012 --> 37:49.432
What are you doing
talking to one of my patients?
I thought I might find you there.

37:49.517 --> 37:51.685
I love it when you pursue me.

37:52.687 --> 37:55.939
You miss me, don't you?
Not as much
as you'd like to think.

37:56.023 --> 37:57.649
Whoa.

37:57.733 --> 38:00.568
Anyway, that's not what
I came here to talk about.

38:00.653 --> 38:02.070
My loss.

38:02.154 --> 38:03.738
There was alpha activity
on Kate's monitor.

38:03.823 --> 38:06.408
Mm-hmm. And?

38:06.492 --> 38:10.453
She actually opened her eyes.
Her monitor was going crazy.

38:12.665 --> 38:16.710
"Going crazy." Would that be
your exact professional diagnosis?

38:16.794 --> 38:19.296
Or could you be
any more specific?

38:19.380 --> 38:22.716
No. I didn't stop
to analyze the readings.

38:22.800 --> 38:27.345
Okay. How about "crazy"
as a simple neural seizure?

38:27.430 --> 38:29.389
It's very common
in cases like this.

38:29.473 --> 38:31.516
Take a nine-volt battery,
hook it up to a dead frog,

38:31.600 --> 38:33.560
you get about the same result.

38:34.562 --> 38:37.314
Peter, I want you to authorize
another brain scan.

38:37.398 --> 38:39.107
I can't do it.

38:39.233 --> 38:42.068
Why?
Because it is unwarranted.

38:42.153 --> 38:44.321
It's a waste of money,
it's a waste oftime,

38:44.405 --> 38:46.323
and as far as I'm concerned,
it's a waste ofa bed.

38:46.449 --> 38:48.450
She's Gumby.
Peter!

38:48.534 --> 38:50.744
Please, Susan, don't push me on this.

38:50.828 --> 38:53.038
You know how I react
when you push me.

38:54.623 --> 38:56.416
How about dinner?

38:58.044 --> 39:00.211
You're unbelievable.

39:01.505 --> 39:04.758
Ifyou change your mind, beep me.
I'm on vibrate.

42:04.772 --> 42:08.942
Dr. Fowler, what are you doing down here?

42:09.026 --> 42:10.652
Did you see a police officer?

42:10.736 --> 42:12.654
Nobody down here but us.

42:12.738 --> 42:17.367
But you betterwatch your step.
It's dangerous down here with all these pipes.

42:17.451 --> 42:19.953
Then I better get back.
Thanks.

42:20.037 --> 42:21.621
Mm-hmm.

42:30.631 --> 42:33.258
He's around the back.
I'll go get him.

42:36.679 --> 42:39.806
Hey, Mac, no smiley face
this time, huh?

42:41.642 --> 42:43.685
Smiling on the inside, Leo.

42:48.023 --> 42:49.732
What do we got here?

42:49.817 --> 42:52.735
Looks like the doctor here
kissed something with a hell ofa jolt.

42:52.820 --> 42:55.113
Fried his brains right down to the nubs.

42:56.824 --> 42:58.700
Oh, Christ.

42:58.826 --> 43:01.661
Friend ofyours?
Not in this life.

43:16.927 --> 43:19.554
Round up the staff.
I want to talk to them.

43:19.638 --> 43:22.640
Anybody- You know,
maintenance people who were working.

43:28.606 --> 43:31.608
I never used to smoke around Peter.

43:31.692 --> 43:35.903
I didn't want him to knowjust how much
he was worming his way under my skin.

43:39.199 --> 43:44.120
So tell me, Detective McKinney,
how do you deal with pain?

43:44.204 --> 43:46.539
Chocolate-chocolate mint ice cream.

43:48.042 --> 43:52.295
About a pint with a ton ofwhipped cream.
Works every time.

44:01.722 --> 44:03.598
I'm sorry about your friend.

44:04.892 --> 44:06.768
Thanks.

44:06.852 --> 44:11.314
Do you have any idea who might have a motive
to use that thing on Myerson?

44:11.398 --> 44:14.150
Practically everyone
who works at this hospital.

44:14.234 --> 44:16.319
That's a hell ofa lineup.

44:18.072 --> 44:20.907
Maybe I ought to
consider myselfa suspect.

44:22.743 --> 44:25.620
Well, then you'd have to
get at the back ofthe line.

44:33.671 --> 44:38.007
I've been meaning to ask you.
Is there a cop assigned to Kate's room?

44:38.092 --> 44:39.717
No. Why do you ask?

44:39.802 --> 44:41.719
Because I saw one
leaving there earlier.

44:41.804 --> 44:44.013
I don't know-
I didn't get a good look at him,

44:44.098 --> 44:47.475
but he was huge
and kind ofscary looking.

44:47.559 --> 44:50.770
I don't know why, but I followed him
down to the tunnels under the hospital.

44:51.855 --> 44:53.356
Where do they lead?

44:53.440 --> 44:56.025
Well, they used to connect with
all the older buildings in the area,

44:56.110 --> 44:57.985
but now I think
they mostly go nowhere.

47:00.400 --> 47:03.236
I've been expecting you, McKinney.

47:05.155 --> 47:08.950
I have a way ofattracting
certain restless souls...

47:09.034 --> 47:13.287
who find no comfort
in conventional wisdom.

47:14.706 --> 47:19.460
I am a houngan malfaiteur.

47:19.545 --> 47:21.712
Raiser ofthe dead.

47:21.797 --> 47:27.677
Does that happen to include
desecration ofcorpses and
stuffing them with dead chickens?

47:28.762 --> 47:31.681
You are not here to...

47:31.765 --> 47:34.934
nail a humble religious practitioner...

47:35.018 --> 47:38.354
on a misdemeanor
corpse desecration charge.

47:49.032 --> 47:51.117
I want to know about resurrection.

47:53.203 --> 47:55.705
I am not a priest.

47:55.789 --> 47:57.498
To some people you are.

48:00.043 --> 48:02.795
Some people leave this world...

48:04.756 --> 48:09.719
with an unanswered cry forjustice.

48:11.263 --> 48:13.139
Sometimes the echo...

48:14.349 --> 48:17.977
don't die away completely.

48:18.061 --> 48:19.770
And when it does?

48:19.855 --> 48:24.525
One might be compelled to return.

48:25.527 --> 48:28.237
But the resurrection,

48:28.322 --> 48:33.910
it's far more painful
and terrifying than death.

48:34.661 --> 48:38.873
You cannot imagine the torment,
the sense of loss...

48:38.957 --> 48:43.085
to walk alone among the living...

48:43.170 --> 48:45.421
and not be alive.

48:47.674 --> 48:52.011
That must be
the most cruel injustice ofall.

48:53.430 --> 48:58.935
Then you'd know something
about that veryjustice,

48:59.019 --> 49:00.978
wouldn't you, McKinney?

49:24.711 --> 49:26.212
Where is he?

49:26.296 --> 49:28.506
You'll find him.

49:28.590 --> 49:30.925
What makes you so sure?

49:31.009 --> 49:34.887
Because you both walk the same path.

49:38.976 --> 49:40.810
Are we tied up
after work tonight or what?

49:40.894 --> 49:44.855
God, I love the smell of
fresh plasma before breakfast.

49:44.940 --> 49:47.149
Dr. Powell.
Ah, Mr. Cooney.

49:47.234 --> 49:49.402
I'm hoping we might be able
to speak privately.

49:49.486 --> 49:52.989
I've got my hands full this morning.
My top trauma guy didn't show up.

49:53.073 --> 49:55.950
Whoa, sweetheart.
Tie offthat femoral there.

49:56.034 --> 49:57.159
He could lose the leg.

49:57.244 --> 50:00.496
He already has as far as I'm concerned.
What's on your mind?

50:00.580 --> 50:02.081
Kate Sullivan.

50:02.207 --> 50:04.667
I am familiarwith the case.
Mm-hmm.

50:04.793 --> 50:06.669
Vegetative state, chronic.
Right.

50:06.753 --> 50:10.339
And there is some legal precedent
to remove her from life support at this stage,

50:10.424 --> 50:11.924
if I'm not mistaken.

50:12.009 --> 50:14.343
Yes, you're correct,
in certain situations.

50:17.139 --> 50:20.016
How we doing?
B.P. dropping,
going into V-tach.

50:20.100 --> 50:25.021
50 c.c.'s digitox.
Be prepared with those paddles.
Why do you ask?

50:25.105 --> 50:28.149
Well, let'sjust say we can
save Kate a great deal of pain...

50:28.233 --> 50:32.445
and save this city a great deal of pain
ifwe put an end to this episode.

50:32.529 --> 50:34.905
We need permission
from next of kin.

50:35.032 --> 50:38.367
Fifty over 25.
Pop another 50.

50:38.452 --> 50:41.454
What's this?
That's a letter ofconsent.

50:41.580 --> 50:43.706
Signed by the mother.
That's right.
We've been talking to her.

50:43.790 --> 50:47.877
She's a very agreeable woman.
In fact, she's a terrific lady.

50:47.961 --> 50:50.546
B.P. 110 over 69.
I think he's coming around.

50:55.052 --> 50:57.803
Welcome back, son.

50:57.888 --> 51:02.224
Nice to get down to the trenches
every once in a while. Keeps you fit.

51:02.309 --> 51:06.103
I would hope
that we could accomplish this
in a timely fashion, Doctor.

51:06.188 --> 51:07.897
I can handle this this afternoon.

51:07.981 --> 51:10.649
Really?
Oh, that'd be terrific, sir.

51:10.734 --> 51:12.902
I really thankyou very much.

51:12.986 --> 51:14.945
And I know Kate would too
ifshe could.

51:15.072 --> 51:17.073
I'm sure she would.

51:17.199 --> 51:19.909
Ah, sewing up now, are we?
Yes, sir.

51:19.993 --> 51:22.953
About time.
By the way, now that you're here.

51:23.038 --> 51:26.791
Uh, I have family
coming in from out oftown.
These are real Knicks fans.

51:26.875 --> 51:29.210
Now, I don't know whetheryou
can do anything about it, but, uh-

51:29.294 --> 51:31.504
Well, I certainly can.

51:31.588 --> 51:35.132
Center court, floor,
right next to Pat Riley.
How's that sound?

51:35.258 --> 51:37.343
Perfect.
Hey, it's my pleasure.

52:05.288 --> 52:07.164
Who's in there?

52:27.227 --> 52:33.149
I don't appreciate my staff using this hospital
like a goddamn Greek restaurant.

52:34.484 --> 52:37.069
Come on out,
whoever's responsible for this.

52:40.115 --> 52:41.532
Aah! No!

52:41.616 --> 52:42.867
Aah!

52:42.951 --> 52:44.994
No!

53:34.586 --> 53:36.253
What the-

53:37.422 --> 53:39.256
Oh, my God!

53:43.011 --> 53:45.971
Where the heck are you driving?
Look at this neighborhood you're
driving through. What, are you crazy?

53:46.056 --> 53:49.183
I wouldn't feel safe ifwe had
a police escort right now.
I swear to God.

53:49.309 --> 53:51.769
- I hearyou, man.
- You need the fucking National Guard
to come through this place.

53:51.853 --> 53:53.812
Hurry up. Come on.
Let's get out of here.

53:55.190 --> 53:59.610
What do you suppose would happen
ifwe showed that cop shooting in full?

53:59.694 --> 54:01.028
Like how?

54:01.112 --> 54:05.115
I mean, like, don't cut out
the stuffthat we usually cut out.

54:05.200 --> 54:10.329
You gotta look at it this way.
Cop brutality sells, okay?
Just ask Rodney.

54:10.413 --> 54:12.081
Yeah, I know that.
But you don't understand-

54:12.165 --> 54:16.085
You gotta find that one little twist
that you can sell it with.

54:16.169 --> 54:18.796
Otherwise,
we don't make a nickel, man.

54:18.922 --> 54:22.675
Drive-by shooting
five blocks from here.
Forget about it.

54:22.801 --> 54:24.885
It's a child!
What?

54:24.970 --> 54:26.512
That's it!

54:41.194 --> 54:42.695
Let's get this.

54:43.989 --> 54:48.200
All right, I want you to go
get the body, shoot the body.
All right.

54:48.326 --> 54:49.410
I'm gonna get some B-roll.
Okay.

54:49.536 --> 54:52.288
I'll catch you back there.
All right?
Right.

54:57.544 --> 54:59.128
Okay.

55:00.130 --> 55:01.797
Hey, did you see who got shot?

55:01.881 --> 55:03.340
Yeah.
You did?

55:03.425 --> 55:06.010
Do you mind if I askyou
a few questions?

55:06.094 --> 55:07.678
Great.

55:08.680 --> 55:11.140
Uh, was it a kid?

55:11.224 --> 55:13.017
Yeah.
Yeah?

55:13.143 --> 55:15.185
Boy or a girl?
Girl.

55:15.270 --> 55:17.479
Sh-Shot bad?

55:17.564 --> 55:19.064
How bad?

55:21.067 --> 55:22.943
Shotgun?

55:24.404 --> 55:25.821
Did you know her?

55:27.615 --> 55:29.116
She's my sister.

55:29.909 --> 55:31.660
She-

55:34.873 --> 55:38.834
Wow. Hey.
Well, life's a bitch, huh, man?

55:52.807 --> 55:54.808
Where the hell is everybody?

55:56.519 --> 55:58.020
Yo, Trib.

56:15.121 --> 56:16.497
Trib!

56:21.753 --> 56:25.047
I should just get a shot ofthis.

56:25.131 --> 56:26.757
This could be it.

57:38.455 --> 57:40.414
Where'd you get the tape?

57:40.498 --> 57:42.374
Elvis.

57:52.302 --> 57:54.219
The buzzer.

57:54.304 --> 57:57.639
You buzzed him in. Why?

57:59.434 --> 58:01.685
We got something here.

58:01.769 --> 58:04.605
What?
It was an insidejob.

58:04.731 --> 58:06.190
Poor Katie.
You buzzed him in. Why?

58:06.274 --> 58:07.983
This will clear her,
won't it?

58:08.067 --> 58:09.651
I hope so.

58:09.736 --> 58:11.570
Let's go.

59:11.464 --> 59:13.298
Huh?

59:54.716 --> 59:57.509
I think my client will be
satisfied with the basic terms.

59:57.594 --> 01:00:00.137
But along with
the suspended sentence,

01:00:00.221 --> 01:00:03.140
I think we need to offer Mr.Jessup
the opportunity to benefit...

01:00:03.224 --> 01:00:05.434
from standard commercial
exploitation of his story.

01:00:05.518 --> 01:00:09.938
Literary rights, film rights,
TV appearances, that sort ofthing.

01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:11.898
So what more do you need from us?

01:00:12.025 --> 01:00:16.862
When you reduce his sentence,
just delete any reference to homicide
or manslaughter from the record.

01:00:16.946 --> 01:00:20.699
Those distinctions would make it
difficult for him to benefit...

01:00:20.783 --> 01:00:24.036
from collecting fees or royalties.

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.955
And you can understand how important
that would be to Mr.Jessup.

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:29.916
Well, I'll- I'll see what I can do.

01:00:30.001 --> 01:00:33.879
Now have you, uh, presented
our offer to Mr.Jessup?

01:00:33.963 --> 01:00:35.505
Oh, no.

01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:40.093
As his attorney, I feel I should be satisfied
with the general parameters first.

01:00:40.219 --> 01:00:42.846
No need in raising
false expectations.

01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:44.723
Oh, ofcourse not.

01:00:47.226 --> 01:00:50.729
Then I can assume
we're in accordance.
Mr.Jessup will be very happy.

01:00:50.813 --> 01:00:52.648
Oh, yeah. Hello, Harry.

01:00:52.774 --> 01:00:55.859
Listen, I don't see any reason
why I can't have access to those records.

01:00:55.943 --> 01:00:57.444
And, uh, Ms. Lindsey.

01:00:57.528 --> 01:00:58.904
Yes?
May I call you Gina?

01:00:58.988 --> 01:01:00.280
Ofcourse, Hank.

01:01:00.365 --> 01:01:01.990
Once this is resolved,

01:01:02.075 --> 01:01:06.578
maybe you and I can have
a cocktail ofour own
and, uh, do a little celebrating.

01:01:06.663 --> 01:01:08.330
Hmm.
I think we can agree on that.

01:01:08.414 --> 01:01:09.831
Okay.

01:01:15.254 --> 01:01:17.297
Save it!
Come on!

01:01:25.473 --> 01:01:27.015
Oh, great. I shot my lawyer.

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:29.643
Fuck 'em.
You can get another one.
They're free.

01:02:18.526 --> 01:02:19.943
What's this?

01:02:23.114 --> 01:02:25.323
Looks like a runaway stiff.

01:04:44.005 --> 01:04:47.132
I thought I told you
not to mess with my patients.

01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:50.969
Then don't leave their cages open.

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:53.013
I didn't.

01:04:53.097 --> 01:04:54.639
I know.

01:04:58.352 --> 01:05:00.854
Thanks.
You're welcome.

01:05:02.356 --> 01:05:05.525
Ifyou've got insurance,
maybe I should send you a bill.

01:05:08.112 --> 01:05:11.573
How about, uh, dinner instead?

01:05:11.657 --> 01:05:13.533
I don't know.

01:05:13.618 --> 01:05:16.286
How long are you planning
to stick around?

01:05:17.955 --> 01:05:21.833
In this place,
not long if I can help it.

01:05:22.835 --> 01:05:25.670
Then I guess dinner
is out ofthe question.

01:05:36.015 --> 01:05:37.724
Jesus.
Mac, I'm sorry.

01:05:37.850 --> 01:05:41.519
Oh, bad timing, Leo.
Katie's missing, Mac.

01:05:41.604 --> 01:05:44.022
She's gone.

01:05:44.148 --> 01:05:47.192
How long could she
stay off life support?
She can't.

01:05:47.276 --> 01:05:49.736
Get me backup, Leo.

01:06:07.713 --> 01:06:10.048
I'll take it from here.
I'm coming with you.

01:06:10.132 --> 01:06:12.133
Stay here.

01:06:23.521 --> 01:06:25.105
Mac.

01:06:25.189 --> 01:06:27.524
I think you need me.

01:06:30.569 --> 01:06:32.237
Come on.

01:07:18.743 --> 01:07:20.952
Welcome back, McKinney.

01:07:22.496 --> 01:07:26.541
Your path has reached its end.

01:07:27.626 --> 01:07:31.629
What we do here is good-

01:07:31.714 --> 01:07:36.217
to unite two tortured souls...

01:07:36.302 --> 01:07:40.263
in holy matrimony.

01:07:40.347 --> 01:07:42.348
That's bullshit.

01:07:42.433 --> 01:07:45.018
There's nothing good
or holy about this.

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:52.442
Ashes to ashes-
Take that shit
away from her.

01:07:54.487 --> 01:07:56.488
Dust to dust.

01:08:07.333 --> 01:08:11.336
I can't imagine
the kind of pain you feel, Matt.
I'm not gonna pretend to.

01:08:14.548 --> 01:08:18.218
But don't condemn her
to the same fate.

01:08:18.301 --> 01:08:19.928
She deserves better.

01:08:20.011 --> 01:08:21.970
You cleared her.

01:08:22.055 --> 01:08:25.015
She's at peace.
Let her go, Matt.

01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:27.685
Let her go.

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:31.189
Finish it!

01:08:59.926 --> 01:09:02.636
I cannot recover this soul.

01:09:04.014 --> 01:09:06.432
She will not allow it.

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:43.553
Mac!

01:09:43.636 --> 01:09:46.180
Mac! Mac!

01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:49.225
Here! Come on!
Hurry up!

01:09:49.350 --> 01:09:52.145
Come on!
Hurry up!

01:09:59.528 --> 01:10:01.362
Mac!

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:06.701
Mac! Hurry! Hurry!
He's coming!

01:10:06.785 --> 01:10:10.413
Mac, hurry up! Hurry!
He's coming! Mac!

01:10:10.497 --> 01:10:12.498
Goddamn it!

01:10:17.838 --> 01:10:19.547
Mac!

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:46.908
Oh, McKinney, it's you.

01:10:46.992 --> 01:10:48.660
Get me an ambulance.

01:10:53.082 --> 01:10:54.999
Let's go.
Queen of Mercy?

01:10:55.125 --> 01:10:57.418
No, the other one.
Check.

01:11:11.016 --> 01:11:13.268
Rest in peace, Katie.

01:11:46.385 --> 01:11:48.219
Are you okay?

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:03.318
Get down!

01:12:03.402 --> 01:12:05.236
What's going on back there?

01:12:05.321 --> 01:12:06.988
Get the hell out of here!

01:12:08.907 --> 01:12:10.241
Jesus!

01:12:26.091 --> 01:12:27.592
I don't see him.

01:12:28.594 --> 01:12:31.596
Mac!

01:13:27.319 --> 01:13:28.986
Son ofa bitch!

01:13:56.014 --> 01:13:57.765
Where is he?

01:14:21.373 --> 01:14:23.958
I hate this!

01:14:54.907 --> 01:14:56.949
Take the wheel.

01:15:02.414 --> 01:15:03.331
Mac!

01:15:03.415 --> 01:15:05.041
- Just keep away from him.
- I can't.

01:15:05.918 --> 01:15:07.084
No!

01:15:09.922 --> 01:15:13.049
What are you doing?
- Just step on the gas.

01:15:22.351 --> 01:15:23.935
Oh!

01:15:26.271 --> 01:15:29.607
Go on! Keep going!

01:15:29.691 --> 01:15:32.235
I'm trying. I'm trying.

01:15:38.033 --> 01:15:41.369
- You son ofa bitch!
- I don't believe this!

01:15:43.622 --> 01:15:46.165
Mac! Mac!

01:15:48.335 --> 01:15:51.128
Go! Go!
Get the fuck out of here!

01:15:51.213 --> 01:15:53.214
- Go! Go! Get going!
- I can't!

01:15:53.298 --> 01:15:54.757
Go!

01:15:56.134 --> 01:15:58.177
I can't! I can't!

01:15:58.262 --> 01:16:00.429
- Move over.
- Oh, my God!

01:16:01.473 --> 01:16:03.599
Do something, Mac!
He's clamped on.

01:16:04.726 --> 01:16:06.102
It's gonna blow!

01:16:06.186 --> 01:16:09.730
Get us out of here!

01:16:11.483 --> 01:16:12.817
Mac!

01:16:17.322 --> 01:16:19.115
Hang on.

01:16:46.518 --> 01:16:48.352
Hang on.
