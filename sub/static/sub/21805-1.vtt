00:15.098 --> 00:17.183
Yes, everything is ready.

00:17.809 --> 00:20.437
-Oh, my God!
-What happened, Alexa?

00:20.520 --> 00:24.649
Cameron Drake wants to meet you
in the boys' cabin at midnight...

00:24.733 --> 00:25.650
to make out!

00:25.734 --> 00:27.152
With me?

00:27.235 --> 00:28.153
Yeah!

00:29.946 --> 00:32.531
-Wanna make out?
-Um, okay.

00:36.953 --> 00:38.580
Pig kisser!

00:38.663 --> 00:39.789
Pig breath.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.250
Get closer!

01:29.255 --> 01:30.381
Mm.

01:39.015 --> 01:43.019
Hey, guys. I'm Alexa Medina,
and this is  Hashtag Reality High.

01:43.102 --> 01:44.771
High school was mad stressful,

01:44.854 --> 01:46.523
so Katsuya and I decided to...

01:46.606 --> 01:50.110
-Tell your sister to turn that off.
-Mom says turn that crap off.

01:50.193 --> 01:52.987
-I can't believe you watch that show.
-The show is not crap.

01:53.071 --> 01:57.075
-You're saying that because it's Alexa.
-The show is crap because it's Alexa.

01:57.158 --> 01:58.743
Would you just get over it?

01:59.452 --> 02:00.370
So...

02:00.453 --> 02:02.789
are you ready
for your scholarship interview?

02:02.872 --> 02:05.500
The one that determines
if I get into my dream school?

02:05.583 --> 02:06.835
I take that as a yes.

02:06.918 --> 02:09.419
Yes. But I'm super nervous.

02:09.503 --> 02:12.382
Fiona is a UC Davis grad
and is writing you a recommendation.

02:12.465 --> 02:14.592
-That should help, right?
-I hope so.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.302
Ooh, you should wear

02:16.386 --> 02:18.763
my chocolate-brown pantsuit
to your interview.

02:19.347 --> 02:21.599
Holy Hillary Clinton,
she's not wearing that.

02:21.683 --> 02:25.353
-Do not hate on that outfit.
-Whatever, I gotta go get Freddie.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.857
Always a treat. See you guys later.

02:33.778 --> 02:34.737
Ah!

02:34.821 --> 02:36.990
-Bye, Grams!
-Good luck, honey!

02:37.073 --> 02:39.075
Be nice to the neighbors, okay?

02:39.576 --> 02:41.035
Oh.

02:41.995 --> 02:42.829
Oh.

02:45.874 --> 02:47.584
Mm.

02:47.667 --> 02:50.044
- Thank you.
- Oh, you are welcome.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.213
What are you doing?

02:52.297 --> 02:54.048
-It's my turn to choose!
-I can't take more Taylor Swift, D.

02:55.425 --> 02:56.676
Mm, ah.

02:56.759 --> 02:59.512
-Admit it! I have better taste than you.
-No, you don't.

02:59.596 --> 03:00.763
-Yes, I do.
-No, you don't.

03:00.847 --> 03:02.765
-You wanna prove it?
-No, you don't!

03:12.483 --> 03:14.110
Nice job, Cam!

03:14.193 --> 03:16.738
- Whoo!
- All right, Cam, great work!

03:16.821 --> 03:17.655
Let's go!

03:17.739 --> 03:20.033
The bleachers are the best place
to work out.

03:20.116 --> 03:22.201
Thanksgiving came early this year.

03:22.285 --> 03:23.494
Oh!

03:23.578 --> 03:24.662
Oh, my God.

03:49.270 --> 03:50.396
It's just me and my car.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.358
I have way more money
than the average person. What's up?

03:53.441 --> 03:55.526
Yo, I...

03:56.319 --> 03:58.071
You're getting in the way of my shot.

03:58.154 --> 03:59.322
Please, will you tag me?

03:59.405 --> 04:01.824
Get over it.

04:01.908 --> 04:04.410
Broussard, get out of my car, man!

04:04.494 --> 04:05.411
Shit!

04:05.495 --> 04:06.579
Whoo!

04:06.663 --> 04:08.289
Come on! Okay.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.800
Are you thinking about
going to the Bonfire?

04:18.882 --> 04:21.052
Oh, no,
I don't like going to those things.

04:21.135 --> 04:23.805
-They're dumb.
-You and I could go. So let's do it.

04:24.514 --> 04:26.140
Are you ready for your interview?

04:26.224 --> 04:28.309
I better be. They only give out
five scholarships.

04:28.393 --> 04:31.521
-Those are shitty odds.
-Yes, I'm well aware of that, thank you.

04:36.234 --> 04:37.986
-I heard he kicks puppies.
-Shut up.

04:38.486 --> 04:41.823
- "Shut up, Freddie."
- Let's go, kids. Make it a great day!

04:41.906 --> 04:43.533
Okay, well, I'll see you later.

04:45.743 --> 04:47.370
A-ha, genius.

04:47.453 --> 04:48.413
-It plays?
-Mm-hmm.

04:48.496 --> 04:49.622
You sure?

04:57.630 --> 05:00.550
Fuck my life.

05:18.818 --> 05:19.986
Nice poster.

05:20.987 --> 05:21.988
Thanks.

05:23.906 --> 05:26.409
- Let me turn this up, there!
- Yo!

05:26.492 --> 05:28.703
-Hey.
-Yo!

05:32.832 --> 05:33.750
Awesome.

05:33.833 --> 05:36.544
Attention! Attention!

05:37.503 --> 05:41.049
Reminding everyone about
the upcoming pep rally!

05:41.132 --> 05:42.467
Go Cougars!

05:44.594 --> 05:46.929
Come cheer on our
returning state swim champs,

05:47.013 --> 05:49.557
led by captain and Olympic hopeful,

05:49.640 --> 05:52.685
- Cameron "The Dolphin" Drake!
- Dolphin, baby!

05:52.769 --> 05:56.814
Look at those muscles! Ow!

05:56.898 --> 05:59.150
Also, you guys.

06:00.276 --> 06:01.152
One more time...

06:24.675 --> 06:25.885
Hola?

06:29.097 --> 06:31.307
-Yes, Alexa?
-Can you move?

06:31.390 --> 06:32.266
You're in my shot.

06:32.350 --> 06:33.518
Oh!

06:33.601 --> 06:35.228
Sorry, yeah, sure.

06:37.939 --> 06:39.273
We'll edit her out in post.

06:39.357 --> 06:42.652
Excuse me, Miss Medina,
but no dogs allowed on school property.

06:42.735 --> 06:46.364
Katsuya is my service dog.
I have severe anxiety.

06:46.447 --> 06:48.825
The Americans with Disabilities Act states

06:48.908 --> 06:51.244
I'm allowed
to have an emotional support dog.

06:51.327 --> 06:53.204
Do you have a problem with dogs

06:53.287 --> 06:55.498
or disabled people or both?

06:55.581 --> 06:57.417
My nine million followers would love
to know.

06:59.669 --> 07:00.962
Of course not, that's ridiculous.

07:01.045 --> 07:02.964
I love dogs and disabled people.

07:03.047 --> 07:06.175
-That explains your wife!
-Strike two, Broussard!

07:07.176 --> 07:08.344
I'll talk to you later.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.599
See you in detention.

07:14.517 --> 07:16.894
- What up, bitches?
- Hey.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.021
-Oh, my gosh.
-Aww.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.023
Hey, babe.

07:21.107 --> 07:24.444
-I can't believe pig face wouldn't move.
-Give her a break.

07:25.027 --> 07:28.156
Whatever. I have a shoot today,
and Katsuya is stressing me out.

07:28.239 --> 07:30.158
You said she was an emotional support dog.

07:30.241 --> 07:31.742
Uh, shut up, Shannon.

07:32.410 --> 07:33.244
Hi, puppy.

07:33.327 --> 07:34.829
You know what? I'll take him.

07:34.912 --> 07:37.165
It's just you and me today, Fluffy Combs.

07:37.248 --> 07:40.501
-I hate it when you call him that.
-Yeah, well, Fluff Daddy loves it.

07:40.585 --> 07:43.421
All right, I'll see you guys tonight.

07:43.504 --> 07:45.298
-Cute outfits.
-Bye.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.803
Whatever. Um... Oh!

07:51.512 --> 07:53.055
Later, babes.

07:53.556 --> 07:56.225
-Dude!
-She just kissed the dog and not you.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.477
Whatever.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.566
Great work.

08:03.649 --> 08:06.652
You should cheat off him next time.

08:10.406 --> 08:11.240
There you go.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.576
Excuse me, Ms. Savage.
Does this belong to you?

08:13.659 --> 08:16.621
I found him wandering the halls
sniffing this magic marker.

08:16.704 --> 08:19.707
This is an outrage,
and I deny all charges.

08:19.790 --> 08:21.167
Have a seat, Mr. Broussard.

08:21.250 --> 08:22.919
Come on, Broussard.

08:23.961 --> 08:26.130
Take a seat.
Stop licking the board.

08:26.214 --> 08:27.590
Thank you, Principal Dixon.

08:27.673 --> 08:30.676
You're welcome.
And, Broussard, I'm watching you.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.886
-Thank you.
-There you go.

08:32.970 --> 08:35.722
Ugh! Whatever.

08:35.806 --> 08:38.226
Deejays don't need history.
We've got style.

08:38.308 --> 08:40.852
Uh, yes, but you do need to graduate.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.355
Good work as always, Miss Barnes.

08:42.438 --> 08:45.608
Oh, yes, haha.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.360
Good grades are hilarious.

08:47.860 --> 08:50.196
Dani, I don't think that is
what they're laughing at.

08:50.279 --> 08:51.197
What?

08:51.948 --> 08:55.201
-They're gloves for your feet?
-But they're ergonomic.

08:55.284 --> 08:58.913
- Dani, they're feet gloves.
- They're feet gloves.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.501
Hi, bud. Okay.

09:05.002 --> 09:08.047
-Ah, man, what happened to Hodor?
-He tore his Achilles.

09:08.130 --> 09:10.341
The surgery's gonna cost like five grand.

09:10.424 --> 09:11.842
Oh, buddy.

09:11.926 --> 09:14.845
I don't know how, Buddy,
but we're gonna figure it out. Okay?

09:15.555 --> 09:17.473
-I gotta take him down.
-Oh, here.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.058
I got him. Come here.

09:19.141 --> 09:22.770
Oh, okay. Yeah.

09:22.853 --> 09:24.897
Light as a feather. Oh, jeez.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.482
-Get him.
-Okay, I'll find him.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.317
I'll go find him. See ya.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.735
-So weird.
-Dani?

09:29.819 --> 09:30.903
Cameron!

09:31.404 --> 09:33.239
Uh...

09:33.322 --> 09:35.241
What are you--
what are you doing here?

09:35.324 --> 09:37.493
The lady in the front told me
to come back here.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.079
It's Katsuya.
He ate like half a chocolate bar.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.790
Here, let me look at--
Put him on the table.

09:43.874 --> 09:46.627
And hold him around the neck there.

09:46.711 --> 09:48.588
You're okay.

09:48.671 --> 09:51.799
There you go. That's good.

09:51.882 --> 09:54.218
And just hold him,
and I'm just gonna feel...

09:54.302 --> 09:56.512
Wow, you really know what you're doing.

09:57.263 --> 09:59.473
It's pretty cool you volunteer here.

09:59.557 --> 10:00.433
I just...

10:01.267 --> 10:02.560
I really like animals!

10:02.643 --> 10:03.561
Oh.

10:04.228 --> 10:05.813
I got my dog from here.

10:05.896 --> 10:07.982
Oh. What kind of dog?

10:08.065 --> 10:10.401
Well, his name is Tyrion.

10:10.484 --> 10:11.819
-Mm-hmm.
-He's a terrier.

10:11.902 --> 10:14.322
He likes to eat my retainer.

10:14.405 --> 10:15.906
I don't wear a retainer.

10:15.990 --> 10:18.075
- Yeah, you do. What?
- What?

10:18.159 --> 10:20.036
It glows in the dark.

10:21.245 --> 10:22.455
Freddie, go clean the kennels.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.667
-Hi there.
-Hey.

10:26.751 --> 10:30.296
I see you've met our best
and prettiest volunteer.

10:30.379 --> 10:34.216
I have. Um, I mean,
she's been really, really helpful.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.177
Fantastic.

10:36.260 --> 10:37.720
How's our furry friend?

10:37.803 --> 10:39.347
His vitals are normal.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.849
-I think he's gonna make it.
-Let's have a listen, huh?

10:42.558 --> 10:44.644
Oh, yes, Katsuya, very strong.

10:44.727 --> 10:47.688
And you look great, too.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.440
Good job, Dani.

10:49.523 --> 10:51.192
Keep him away from the chocolate.

10:51.275 --> 10:54.362
-Thanks, Doc.
-He's fine. You can say it right now.

10:54.445 --> 10:56.155
Just go.

10:56.238 --> 10:57.698
Oh! Got a Wink.

10:58.449 --> 10:59.867
Ooh, six-foot-yes!

10:59.950 --> 11:03.037
Uh, hey, um, thanks for everything?

11:03.120 --> 11:06.082
I'd love to buy you a burger
for helping me out.

11:06.165 --> 11:07.166
Uh...

11:07.249 --> 11:08.292
She doesn't eat meat.

11:08.959 --> 11:10.294
Okay, okay, cool.

11:10.378 --> 11:13.672
- They got other stuff, too.
- You know? No meat. I get it.

11:14.423 --> 11:15.633
-Think about it.
-Bye.

11:16.717 --> 11:19.220
"Oh, come on, girl,
let's just like, go eat food."

11:19.303 --> 11:20.304
Freddie. Freddie!

11:21.263 --> 11:23.557
That is just...

11:24.225 --> 11:25.226
inappropriate.

11:25.309 --> 11:27.603
-What's up?
-What? Uh, nothing.

11:27.686 --> 11:30.648
-Did you see a spider? Oh!
-No, I meant the... bag.

11:30.731 --> 11:33.692
This. Of course.
This is for your interview.

11:33.776 --> 11:35.361
-What?
-Just a little thank you

11:35.444 --> 11:38.072
for all of your help
with the adoption event.

11:38.155 --> 11:39.490
Thank you.

11:39.573 --> 11:41.158
You didn't have to do that.

11:41.242 --> 11:44.161
Well, first impressions go a long way.

11:44.245 --> 11:45.705
-Fiona.
-Mm-hmm.

11:46.288 --> 11:48.624
If a guy...

11:49.542 --> 11:53.295
asks you out for a burger,
does that mean that he likes you?

11:53.379 --> 11:55.881
-Did Cameron ask you out?
-I don't know. He...

11:55.965 --> 11:56.966
He has a girlfriend.

11:57.049 --> 11:58.843
He has a girlfriend. I-- I...

11:58.926 --> 11:59.927
Doesn't matter.

12:00.010 --> 12:02.680
Are they married?
For all you know, he's polyamorous.

12:02.763 --> 12:05.683
I'm getting off track.
The point is, he wants to buy you food.

12:05.766 --> 12:07.143
That means he likes you.

12:07.226 --> 12:11.439
Most guys call after the kitchen closes
for last call, well drinks.

12:11.522 --> 12:13.149
-What's a well drink?
-It doesn't matter.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.067
Hopefully you'll never have to understand.

12:15.151 --> 12:18.696
Just take it from a--
year-old woman,

12:18.779 --> 12:22.575
single, who's waiting for Winks,
that when the hottest guy in high school

12:22.658 --> 12:24.201
asks you out, you say "yes."

12:24.910 --> 12:27.204
Okay, thank you.

12:27.288 --> 12:28.372
You're welcome.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.212
That cannot be real.

12:46.140 --> 12:48.726
- I got a better question.
- All right.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.395
- Lindsay Lohan...
- Okay.

12:51.479 --> 12:53.063
or Hilary Duff?

12:53.147 --> 12:54.648
-Lindsay Lohan.
-What?

12:54.732 --> 12:56.233
You're crazy, man.

12:56.317 --> 12:58.194
-Nikes or Adidas?
-Uh, Nikes.

12:58.277 --> 13:00.654
-Got any fries with that shake?
-Not for you.

13:01.405 --> 13:02.656
Yo.

13:03.991 --> 13:06.452
Don't look now.
I think Holly was checking for me.

13:07.161 --> 13:09.205
Bro, why don't you just ask her out?

13:09.288 --> 13:11.707
-I'm working on something.
-What? Facial hair?

13:14.126 --> 13:16.170
- That's your big plan?
- Yeah.

13:16.253 --> 13:18.214
I'm not trying to sound like Vinny,

13:18.297 --> 13:21.634
but how in the hell is
a hooptie gonna help you get Holly?

13:21.717 --> 13:24.178
That doesn't sound like me.
I call it a shit-box.

13:25.179 --> 13:26.680
-Yo!
-Yeah.

13:26.764 --> 13:28.516
Clearly I'm gonna fix it up.

13:28.599 --> 13:32.102
I heard Holly went out with Dingleberry
'cause she loved his old school.

13:32.186 --> 13:34.230
So, it's a sign.

13:34.730 --> 13:39.818
-Of what? That she's shallow?
-Says the man dating Alexa Medina.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.195
-Oh!
-Oh! Got you there.

13:41.278 --> 13:44.448
All right, look.
Okay, okay, Alexa's not that bad.

13:44.532 --> 13:46.617
She does stuff like,

13:46.700 --> 13:48.702
when she volunteered at that hospital.

13:48.786 --> 13:50.079
Were the cameras there?

13:50.162 --> 13:52.873
Man, just admit it.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.668
You're with her
'cause she's the hottest girl in school.

13:55.751 --> 13:58.921
You're the hottest guy in school,
next to me. All right?

13:59.004 --> 14:02.341
Like Darwin said, "Hot people are supposed
to have sex with each other."

14:02.424 --> 14:05.010
-That's not what Darwin said.
-That's not even close.

14:05.886 --> 14:07.721
Whatever, man. It's science.

14:08.264 --> 14:11.475
Yeah, my point is just I think me
and Holly were kinda meant to be.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.811
Why don't you
just buy her a six-pack?

14:13.894 --> 14:17.439
- Why are we friends?
- What? Chicks love six-packs.

14:19.900 --> 14:21.777
I think I'm gonna pee in my pants.

14:22.486 --> 14:23.779
This is a bad idea.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.740
You don't have the best track record
with these people, Dani.

14:27.825 --> 14:31.453
Maybe we should just go back to my place.

14:31.537 --> 14:34.039
Gram is making a mean White Russian.

14:34.540 --> 14:35.457
Be fun.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.878
Okay, Alexa isn't here.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.296
I think I can do this.

14:41.630 --> 14:43.591
And also, I really have to pee.

14:43.966 --> 14:46.135
So I'm just gonna use the washroom.

14:46.218 --> 14:47.845
Okay, well, I'll be here.

14:49.221 --> 14:50.097
I'll be waiting.

14:57.021 --> 14:58.439
Okay, dude.

14:58.522 --> 14:59.940
Ah!

15:00.024 --> 15:01.942
It's now or never. Just say...

15:03.944 --> 15:04.778
Dani.

15:14.830 --> 15:15.998
Open doors much?

15:16.665 --> 15:19.293
It's not her fault.
She's used to doggy doors.

15:19.376 --> 15:20.711
What are you doing here?

15:20.794 --> 15:23.255
Don't you spend your nights
at the kennels with the other bitches?

15:23.339 --> 15:25.674
Come on, guys, let's go.
Everybody's waiting.

15:30.304 --> 15:32.556
Cameron told me what you did for Katsuya.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.018
Stay away from my boyfriend and my dog...

15:36.560 --> 15:37.811
pig breath.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.244
Danielle...

15:54.954 --> 15:56.372
for like f...

15:59.833 --> 16:02.419
Hey, so I was, uh, thinking that maybe...

16:02.503 --> 16:04.254
Save it. We don't have to stay.

16:04.338 --> 16:05.255
What?

16:06.215 --> 16:07.091
Why?

16:08.509 --> 16:11.929
-Wait, why? What happened?
-It doesn't matter. I want to go home!

16:13.097 --> 16:14.014
Okay.

16:17.393 --> 16:18.560
I'm sorry.

16:18.644 --> 16:21.313
This was a bad idea.
I shouldn't have dragged you here.

16:21.397 --> 16:22.940
No, no, it's fine.

16:23.691 --> 16:27.277
It's fine, let's just,
let's get out of here.

16:30.114 --> 16:31.281
It's good.

16:38.247 --> 16:40.165
Sure you don't wanna come up?

16:40.249 --> 16:41.959
I just want to go to bed.

16:43.335 --> 16:45.504
Ahem.

16:46.755 --> 16:49.133
Uh, first I gotta tell you something.

16:49.883 --> 16:53.012
-What?
-I... uh...

17:00.352 --> 17:03.647
- I just got my first paying gig!
- Freddie!

17:03.731 --> 17:05.858
-Yeah. You gotta come.
-That's amazing!

17:07.401 --> 17:09.987
It's just a bar mitzvah, but get this,

17:10.069 --> 17:14.782
Calvin Harris' agent's son
used to be best friends with the kid.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.410
Okay.

17:16.492 --> 17:20.329
The son of the agent
of the deejay you're obsessed with...

17:21.205 --> 17:24.917
-might be at the party?
-Okay, you joke, but this could be huge.

17:25.627 --> 17:27.838
-Of course I'll be there.
-Good.

17:27.921 --> 17:29.256
'Cause I also need a ride.

17:29.339 --> 17:31.175
Oh, my...

17:35.429 --> 17:36.472
Freddie?

17:37.765 --> 17:39.058
Thank you.

17:40.601 --> 17:41.477
I'll see you tomorrow.

17:41.560 --> 17:42.728
Okay.

17:48.692 --> 17:50.069
Stupid.

17:50.694 --> 17:51.862
Stupid.

18:19.431 --> 18:20.474
What?

18:32.653 --> 18:34.571
"Go fund me."

18:56.135 --> 18:58.178
"My name is Alexa Medina,

18:58.762 --> 19:00.764
and I'm a huge slut."

19:01.640 --> 19:02.850
Dad!

19:02.933 --> 19:04.476
-Close the door!
-So sorry!

19:11.066 --> 19:14.361
Why are you on Facebook?
And why are you doing your hair?

19:14.444 --> 19:15.821
-Get out.
-Fine.

19:15.904 --> 19:18.866
But you should know your
GoFundMe campaign is not gonna work.

19:18.949 --> 19:20.576
What? Why?

19:20.659 --> 19:23.412
me and Grandma.

19:23.495 --> 19:25.956
I don't have any money,
and Grandma is dead.

19:26.039 --> 19:28.709
-So what do I do?
-You're so hopeless.

19:28.792 --> 19:29.835
I'll share it for you.

19:29.918 --> 19:32.629
But you need to get some friends
and a new phone.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.471
-Father.
-Daughter.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.975
Oh. You're doing your hair.

19:45.058 --> 19:45.976
Yes.

19:46.059 --> 19:48.061
First impressions go a long way.

19:49.438 --> 19:52.316
-OM effing G!
-Watch your effing mouth!

19:52.399 --> 19:54.985
You're not gonna believe this.
Alexa broke up with Cameron last night,

19:55.068 --> 19:56.778
and guess who she's dating!

19:56.862 --> 19:57.779
- Breathe.
- Fousey.

19:57.863 --> 20:00.407
I love this guy. Everyone's saying
it's so she can get followers.

20:00.490 --> 20:01.658
Breathe.

20:03.285 --> 20:04.494
And you're...

20:05.204 --> 20:06.455
telling me this why?

20:06.538 --> 20:07.623
Just saying.

20:07.706 --> 20:10.626
Sweetie, you've had a crush on Cameron
since the fourth grade.

20:10.709 --> 20:13.128
- Mm-hmm.
- What? I have not.

20:13.212 --> 20:16.048
Yes, you have.
Remember that song we used to sing?

20:18.634 --> 20:20.761
-We're singing the Cameron song!
-We are.

20:26.975 --> 20:29.645
I don't have time for this.
I have to get ready for my interviews.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.735
Rise and shine, champ!

20:37.444 --> 20:40.906
You can't qualify for the Olympics
cuddled up in bed with your blanket.

20:41.615 --> 20:43.575
I don't feel good, Dad.

20:43.659 --> 20:47.537
Hmm. You think Michael Phelps
only trains when he feels good? Mnh-mnh.

20:47.621 --> 20:51.667
The best thing
for a broken heart is distraction.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.961
Now get your ass up out that bed
and into that suit!

20:54.044 --> 20:55.545
I don't have a broken heart.

20:55.629 --> 20:56.630
Really?

20:56.713 --> 21:00.175
You know she dumped you for Fousey, right?
That's that YouTube guy.

21:00.259 --> 21:04.137
I never seen you in yoga pants,
but you might not win the champ--

21:04.221 --> 21:06.932
How did you even know about this?
We broke up eight hours ago.

21:07.015 --> 21:09.518
Ah. Lana follows Alexa on The Gram.

21:10.143 --> 21:12.938
Jesus! Everybody at school's
gonna be talking about this.

21:13.021 --> 21:16.566
Mnh-mnh-mnh. So let's give them
something else to talk about.

21:17.442 --> 21:20.946
Look, son. First loves...

21:21.738 --> 21:22.990
they don't mean shit.

21:23.657 --> 21:24.700
Nice, Dad.

21:24.783 --> 21:25.659
Yeah.

21:25.742 --> 21:29.413
I know something
that's gonna cheer you up.

21:29.496 --> 21:32.541
Lana's little sister just got dumped, too.

21:32.624 --> 21:36.169
- You do realize that's my aunt, right?
- Step-auntie. Lana!

21:36.253 --> 21:37.129
What's up, babe?

21:37.212 --> 21:40.215
I was thinking we could hook Cam up
with Piper.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.676
O-M-G!

21:42.759 --> 21:45.262
You guys would have,
like, the cutest babies ever.

21:45.345 --> 21:46.346
Piper's hot.

21:46.805 --> 21:48.890
I've dated hot girls, Dad.

21:49.808 --> 21:53.145
Maybe I want a girl
that's more than just... hot.

22:25.969 --> 22:27.179
Whoa.

22:29.890 --> 22:31.224
Is that a good whoa?

22:32.309 --> 22:35.437
My interview is in ten minutes,
and Fiona got me this outfit.

22:35.520 --> 22:38.690
And I don't--

22:46.948 --> 22:49.076
- Freddie!
- What?

22:49.743 --> 22:51.328
I said, do I look okay?

22:51.411 --> 22:55.665
Oh, you, you look... like a model.

22:55.749 --> 22:58.210
I'm gonna go to my locker.

23:00.295 --> 23:01.963
So weird.

23:02.047 --> 23:03.173
Hey, Dani.

23:04.007 --> 23:06.468
Oh. Uh. Hey.

23:06.551 --> 23:08.095
You look really nice.

23:08.178 --> 23:09.930
Thanks.

23:10.013 --> 23:13.141
I have
a really important scholarship interview.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.976
Oh, wow.

23:15.060 --> 23:16.686
We missed you at Biggie's.

23:16.770 --> 23:21.358
Oh, yeah. I, um, I...
we were crazy busy at the clinic.

23:21.441 --> 23:24.069
Ah. You didn't miss anything.
You know.

23:24.152 --> 23:28.782
Except for, uh, what TMZ is reporting
as the most epic high school break up.

23:29.366 --> 23:30.200
Yeah.

23:31.618 --> 23:33.495
That was insensitive.
I shouldn't have said that.

23:33.578 --> 23:34.871
-No. It's fine, you know.
-Sorry.

23:34.955 --> 23:36.581
It's cool. Yeah.

23:36.665 --> 23:38.542
I still owe you a burger.

23:38.625 --> 23:40.877
Veggie burger, that is, yeah.

23:40.961 --> 23:44.172
I'm having a party Saturday.
If you're around, you should come.

23:45.257 --> 23:47.968
Um... yeah.

23:48.051 --> 23:50.637
-Oh?
-Yeah. I think I could probably...

23:50.720 --> 23:53.056
-Oh.
-Ooh. I didn't...

23:55.016 --> 23:56.518
I wanted to make sure that was closed.

23:56.601 --> 23:57.644
Okay.

23:57.727 --> 24:00.689
-I think I could swing that. Mm-hmm.
-It's at noon.

24:00.772 --> 24:04.025
-I'll see you then?
-Cool! I will see you then.

24:04.109 --> 24:05.902
-See you then, right? Yeah.
-Cool.

24:07.404 --> 24:08.905
-Oh.
-Yeah.

24:10.615 --> 24:11.950
-Your class this way?
-I'm, uh...

24:12.033 --> 24:15.120
No. I forgot my paper clips,

24:15.203 --> 24:16.955
-so I'm just gonna...
-Paper clips.

24:17.038 --> 24:19.207
-Yeah.
-That's-- yeah.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.960
- I broke my stapler.
- Oh, what's up?

24:23.253 --> 24:24.504
Hi.

24:25.672 --> 24:29.217
-Hey, Lily.
-You're a very brave boy, very brave.

24:29.301 --> 24:31.636
And... voilà, like that.

24:31.720 --> 24:34.055
That guy will never
have to pay puppy support.

24:34.723 --> 24:37.142
-Oh, my God, guess what.
-You aced your interview.

24:37.225 --> 24:39.519
-No. I mean, yes, uh, they loved me.
-Ah!

24:39.603 --> 24:41.980
-Fantastic!
-But that's not it.

24:42.063 --> 24:44.900
Cameron Drake asked me out for real.

24:45.275 --> 24:48.945
That is fan-fricking-tastic!

24:49.029 --> 24:50.363
-Right?
-No!

24:50.447 --> 24:51.990
I don't have anything to wear.

24:52.073 --> 24:54.117
I can't wear my interview outfit
to a party.

24:54.201 --> 24:57.204
-No, no, no, no, no.
-My dad gave me his credit card.

24:57.287 --> 24:59.164
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

24:59.247 --> 25:01.750
You have come to the right place.

25:01.833 --> 25:03.084
I...

25:03.752 --> 25:07.839
I'm going to make you look
like the hottest person at that party,

25:15.764 --> 25:16.973
Hello?

25:19.434 --> 25:20.727
Hello?

25:29.778 --> 25:31.071
You lost?

25:31.947 --> 25:34.866
Wow, you look really nice.

25:34.950 --> 25:35.867
Thanks.

25:35.951 --> 25:38.203
Uh, the party's this way.

25:38.286 --> 25:39.579
Come on.

25:46.711 --> 25:48.797
I did tell you
this was a pool party, right?

26:05.146 --> 26:08.441
Hey, Dani! Prom's not for three months!

26:10.151 --> 26:13.613
-Holy God.
-Don't listen to him.

26:13.697 --> 26:15.282
I got you.

26:15.365 --> 26:16.908
Come on. Let's go.

26:18.201 --> 26:19.077
No, he's right.

26:19.160 --> 26:22.205
I look like NeNe Leakes
on  Dancing with the Stars.

26:22.289 --> 26:24.082
No, no, no. I don't agree with that.

26:24.165 --> 26:27.377
Oh, my God,
is that Never-Been-Dicked Dani?

26:28.169 --> 26:30.380
She looks kinda hot.

26:30.463 --> 26:33.216
Let's see what Alexa thinks.

26:40.098 --> 26:42.267
-Are you 21? I'm just kidding.
-Yeah.

26:42.350 --> 26:44.686
Here you go.
Yeah, you like that? Get out of here.

26:44.769 --> 26:46.229
-What's up?
-Hey, there he is!

26:46.313 --> 26:48.440
-What's up? You guys remember Dani?
-What up?

26:48.523 --> 26:49.816
-Hey! Dani.
-Dani.

26:49.899 --> 26:51.359
Dani.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.653
-Cameron here has been waiting for you.
-Ah, whoa.

26:53.737 --> 26:54.779
I like that dress.

26:54.863 --> 26:55.864
Yeah, you want some?

26:56.698 --> 26:58.408
-Uh, maybe later.
-Come on.

26:58.491 --> 27:00.201
It's early.

27:00.285 --> 27:01.494
All right. More for me.

27:01.578 --> 27:02.746
-Enjoy.
-Save me some.

27:02.829 --> 27:04.039
Yeah, maybe.

27:04.122 --> 27:05.915
You guys have fun, all right?

27:05.999 --> 27:06.833
Yeah.

27:08.293 --> 27:09.627
Him and Dani though?

27:09.711 --> 27:11.129
-Right?
-Golly.

27:11.212 --> 27:13.715
Hey! Hold my legs.
Come on, let's do this!

27:13.798 --> 27:15.383
-All right.
-I'm the Kegenator!

27:15.467 --> 27:18.136
Yo, Jimbo! Come over here,
put this thing in my mouth!

27:18.219 --> 27:20.972
-Kegenator. Let's do this.
-Three, two, one. Here we go.

27:21.056 --> 27:21.973
Yeah, baby!

27:22.057 --> 27:24.225
I love beer!

27:28.480 --> 27:31.191
Drown that bitch.

27:33.151 --> 27:35.945
Oh, hey, Dani.

27:36.029 --> 27:38.656
OMG, perfect.

27:38.740 --> 27:39.824
I hate you.

27:40.617 --> 27:41.993
We're gonna play beer pong.

27:42.077 --> 27:44.788
-Holly, you wanna come?
-Oh! Yeah. Hold this.

27:45.497 --> 27:47.082
Thank you.

27:47.957 --> 27:49.542
- Shannon.
- Yeah?

27:49.626 --> 27:50.752
Holly needs a partner.

27:50.835 --> 27:52.295
What?

27:52.379 --> 27:53.463
Oh!

27:56.633 --> 27:59.803
-How do I, like...
-I mean, you can throw right here.

27:59.886 --> 28:03.640
-You can go and bounce. Either way.
-You make it in, we give the balls back.

28:04.766 --> 28:05.850
Oh.

28:05.934 --> 28:07.394
Kiss it.

28:09.396 --> 28:10.772
Mnh-mnh. It's our turn now.

28:10.855 --> 28:12.565
Well, I kinda suck.

28:12.649 --> 28:16.027
-You were supposed to be...
-It wasn't even your turn.

28:42.178 --> 28:43.805
Okay.

28:43.888 --> 28:45.056
Carry on.

29:05.034 --> 29:05.994
Bye!

29:06.077 --> 29:07.120
Bye!

29:07.203 --> 29:08.580
See you later, bro.

29:15.128 --> 29:16.337
The water's nice.

29:18.465 --> 29:19.466
Want to jump in?

29:19.966 --> 29:21.676
Oh. No, thanks.

29:24.012 --> 29:26.389
You sure?
You can borrow one of Lana's suits.

29:31.269 --> 29:32.729
I can't swim.

29:34.230 --> 29:35.607
Really?

29:35.690 --> 29:37.066
Let me teach you.

29:37.150 --> 29:40.111
-I'm kinda good at it. I'm a'ight.
-Oh, wow!

29:41.070 --> 29:42.781
Handsome and humble.

29:45.241 --> 29:46.367
You think I'm handsome?

29:49.954 --> 29:51.748
This can't be right.

29:55.001 --> 29:56.419
-Oh!
-Oh, Jesus!

29:56.503 --> 29:58.671
-Freddie!
-What is on your face?

29:58.755 --> 30:02.342
-I'm getting ready for a date.
-With who? A war chief?

30:02.425 --> 30:05.845
It's called contouring and highlighting.

30:05.929 --> 30:08.973
-What do you want?
-Have you seen Dani?

30:09.682 --> 30:12.852
Didn't she tell you? I gave her
the day off to go to Cameron's party.

30:14.103 --> 30:15.355
Oh, yeah, right.

30:15.438 --> 30:18.608
Um, that was today. Great. I'll just...

30:19.442 --> 30:21.820
-I'll just give her a call.
-Okay.

30:48.721 --> 30:49.973
Uh...

30:51.724 --> 30:57.564
For the record,
Lana doesn't own any one pieces.

30:57.647 --> 31:00.483
Just to warn you.

31:20.753 --> 31:21.963
Hi.

31:26.634 --> 31:28.011
Now kick.

31:29.345 --> 31:31.431
- Continuously.
- Oh.

31:31.514 --> 31:32.849
I knew that.

31:34.142 --> 31:36.185
You have to relax your body.

31:36.269 --> 31:37.520
Oh.

31:38.313 --> 31:39.898
You mean like this?

31:41.733 --> 31:43.568
No, I mean like this.

31:43.651 --> 31:45.904
Oh, yeah, that was way better.

31:45.987 --> 31:47.322
-Okay.
-Congratulations.

31:47.405 --> 31:48.406
Okay, okay.

31:48.489 --> 31:49.699
Back to work.

31:53.328 --> 31:54.662
Where are we going?

31:55.163 --> 31:56.289
You trust me?

31:56.956 --> 31:58.666
I guess so.

32:06.132 --> 32:07.759
-What?
-Uh, nothing.

32:07.842 --> 32:09.135
I'm just...

32:10.053 --> 32:12.639
wondering why we've never hung out before.

32:13.306 --> 32:15.892
Why do you think? Your girlfriend.

32:15.975 --> 32:18.144
Ex-girlfriend.

32:19.062 --> 32:21.147
I just don't get it.

32:21.814 --> 32:24.567
Like, you're so nice and she's just...

32:24.651 --> 32:26.069
-Alexa?
-What?

32:29.447 --> 32:31.240
Look...

32:31.324 --> 32:36.788
I know she was mean to you before,
but she was just jealous.

32:38.414 --> 32:41.626
Of me? Why?

32:42.335 --> 32:43.628
Because she knew I had a crush on you.

32:44.295 --> 32:47.048
Oh. What? I--

32:48.883 --> 32:51.594
Ooh, I got ya. I got ya.

32:51.678 --> 32:53.638
I got you.

32:53.721 --> 32:55.264
I got you.

33:02.939 --> 33:03.898
Cam!

33:04.482 --> 33:05.441
Honey, hi.

33:05.525 --> 33:07.193
Where does your dad keep the weed?

33:07.276 --> 33:08.528
Uh...

33:08.611 --> 33:11.531
I don't know.

33:11.614 --> 33:13.825
I didn't even know he smoked, so...

33:13.908 --> 33:16.911
-I'm sorry.
-Lana... Wait, wait. I got you.

33:18.037 --> 33:18.955
You okay?

33:19.998 --> 33:22.417
That was the most fun I've had
in the water in a long time.

33:22.500 --> 33:23.876
Well, you're a good teacher.

33:23.960 --> 33:25.962
Well, you're a good student.

33:26.045 --> 33:30.341
A few more lessons and you'll be ready
to swim in the ocean at the Bonfire.

33:46.649 --> 33:52.572
I wasn't really planning
on going to that thing.

33:54.282 --> 33:55.616
That thing?

33:56.325 --> 33:58.953
That thing is a senior rite of passage.

33:59.746 --> 34:03.124
There's dope music. People are drinking
and dancing on the sand.

34:03.207 --> 34:06.002
When it gets late, everyone cuddles up
next to the bonfire to get warm.

34:06.085 --> 34:08.045
It's awesome. You got to go.

34:09.964 --> 34:11.257
Do I?

34:11.340 --> 34:12.717
Yes. Everyone goes.

34:15.678 --> 34:17.096
Okay, um...

34:17.179 --> 34:18.264
-Yeah.
-Okay.

34:18.347 --> 34:20.308
You should go. You should definitely...

34:20.391 --> 34:21.726
I'm gonna go.

34:21.809 --> 34:22.851
Yeah.

34:24.978 --> 34:27.523
-Thank you. It's just my car is...
-Everything work?

34:27.607 --> 34:28.733
-No, it's fine.
-Okay.

34:28.815 --> 34:31.027
-It's sometimes the circuit is...
-Oh!

34:31.110 --> 34:33.196
Cool, cool. Yeah, just, um...

34:34.280 --> 34:36.532
-get home safe and hit me.
-I had a lot of fun.

34:36.616 --> 34:38.534
-I had so much fun.
-Yeah, me, too.

34:38.618 --> 34:39.827
I'm glad you came.

34:40.786 --> 34:42.080
Okay.

34:43.664 --> 34:45.708
-Uh... Your lights. Lights.
-Oh, sh--

34:45.792 --> 34:47.085
Oh, my God.

34:47.168 --> 34:49.420
-There it is. It's not raining.
-Yeah, I got--

34:52.422 --> 34:54.592
Yo, are you serious?

34:54.675 --> 34:57.428
No, so you bring up the Senior Bonfire,

34:57.512 --> 35:01.015
you tell her she has to go,
you know everyone's bringing a date,

35:01.099 --> 35:03.184
and yet you don't ask her?

35:03.267 --> 35:04.143
-I know.
-What?

35:04.227 --> 35:05.353
I know, I messed up.

35:05.436 --> 35:07.146
I'm not used to this.

35:07.230 --> 35:08.397
She's not Alexa.

35:08.481 --> 35:09.774
Thank God.

35:10.650 --> 35:11.943
She's a normal person.

35:12.026 --> 35:13.361
She's deeper than Alexa.

35:13.444 --> 35:16.739
She probably cares about things
like thinking and feeling.

35:19.117 --> 35:22.912
Yo, you might actually
have to put in some work on this one.

35:23.704 --> 35:26.082
You're right. I'm gonna ask her out.

35:26.833 --> 35:27.875
I got this.

35:49.856 --> 35:50.690
Got you, got you.

35:51.482 --> 35:53.776
Oh, uh.

35:53.860 --> 35:54.944
Thank you.

35:55.027 --> 35:56.237
You're welcome.

35:59.949 --> 36:04.078
So did you catch
Neil deGrasse Tyson's TED Talk?

36:04.162 --> 36:06.581
Uh, no.

36:06.664 --> 36:08.207
Wow, it was so enlightening.

36:09.542 --> 36:11.043
I'll have to check it out.

36:12.295 --> 36:13.337
Thank you.

36:13.421 --> 36:15.089
You're welcome.

36:15.590 --> 36:18.801
I called ahead to make sure
they have veggie burgers.

36:18.885 --> 36:20.928
Oh, that's very sweet of you. Thank you.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.221
No prob.

36:23.598 --> 36:27.393
So, um, you know, I was thinking.

36:27.476 --> 36:29.478
- You know, uh...
- Hey, Cameron.

36:30.146 --> 36:31.689
Oh, hey.

36:31.772 --> 36:33.649
This is my boyfriend  Fowsee.

36:33.733 --> 36:35.693
You're cute, babe.

36:35.776 --> 36:37.904
-Fousey. Nice to meet you.
-You, too.

36:37.987 --> 36:38.821
Fousey?

36:38.905 --> 36:41.741
Oh, my God!
My sister's a huge fan of yours.

36:41.824 --> 36:44.076
Everyone is.
He has like ten million followers.

36:44.160 --> 36:46.704
Uh, 12.7,
but who's counting, right?

36:46.787 --> 36:50.666
Oh, she would kill me if I didn't get
a photo with you. Do you mind?

36:50.750 --> 36:53.002
Let's do it.
Make sure you get my ass in the shot.

36:53.085 --> 36:54.337
-Of course.
-Ready?

36:57.173 --> 36:58.174
Do it. Sorry.

37:01.093 --> 37:02.220
- Awesome!
- Tag me.

37:03.721 --> 37:07.391
Most boring diary ever.

37:10.436 --> 37:11.687
Oh, my God!

37:11.771 --> 37:13.522
That's Fousey with sis.

37:20.821 --> 37:23.741
I hope that wasn't
too weird earlier?

37:23.824 --> 37:27.787
-This is what I really wanted to show you.
-You do know I've seen the ocean before.

37:28.496 --> 37:30.206
All right, smarty pants.

37:31.332 --> 37:32.333
Have you seen this?

37:36.462 --> 37:37.296
Oh, my God.

37:37.380 --> 37:38.756
Pretty cool, huh?

37:39.465 --> 37:40.633
What is it?

37:41.842 --> 37:43.844
Bioluminescent plankton.

37:43.928 --> 37:46.764
Normally you'd need a microscope
to see it, but we're in an algal bloom.

37:47.515 --> 37:48.516
Dope, huh?

37:48.599 --> 37:49.850
It's beautiful.

37:50.559 --> 37:52.228
I mean, dope.

37:52.687 --> 37:54.814
How do you know so much about this?

37:54.897 --> 37:57.358
I've been into this since I was a kid.

37:57.441 --> 38:01.654
As corny as it sounds,
my dream is to study marine biology.

38:02.947 --> 38:05.491
I even applied to UCLA
because of their program.

38:06.659 --> 38:07.868
It's not corny.

38:07.952 --> 38:09.453
You're lucky.

38:09.537 --> 38:11.330
You found two things you love.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.671
What was that?

38:19.255 --> 38:20.715
I love swimming.

38:20.798 --> 38:23.759
But if I had to choose,
I'd definitely choose this.

38:23.843 --> 38:25.386
Why do you have to choose?

38:26.595 --> 38:27.763
My dad.

38:28.681 --> 38:31.517
He wants me to go to the Olympics
then take over his dealership.

38:31.600 --> 38:34.687
If I told him I wanted to go to school,
he'd lose his shit.

38:36.814 --> 38:37.648
Oh.

38:40.067 --> 38:42.653
If you know in your heart
what you want to do...

38:43.696 --> 38:45.239
you should just tell him.

38:45.323 --> 38:46.907
I'm sure he'll get it.

38:53.080 --> 38:55.166
You're the first person
I've ever brought here.

38:56.375 --> 38:59.920
I must be special.

39:02.173 --> 39:03.382
You are.

39:10.389 --> 39:12.600
I'd love for you to go
to the Bonfire with me.

39:16.312 --> 39:17.146
Uh...

39:19.440 --> 39:20.775
Uh...

39:20.858 --> 39:25.780
I'm-- Yes.
I'm a huge fan of fire, so, that'd be...

40:04.568 --> 40:05.694
Taylor!

40:06.362 --> 40:07.238
Yes?

40:07.321 --> 40:10.366
Quit reading my diary!
And eavesdropping at my door.

40:10.449 --> 40:11.617
I wasn't!

40:12.201 --> 40:16.122
I just happened to be walking by,
with your new phone.

40:17.039 --> 40:18.082
I had an upgrade.

40:18.165 --> 40:20.126
Wait, how do you know my password?

40:20.209 --> 40:22.628
Come on. "Puppies, one, two, three?"

40:48.404 --> 40:49.572
Hey.

40:58.164 --> 41:00.875
This is it. All right.

41:00.958 --> 41:05.129
-All right.
-Soak him. Look at you. Very professional.

41:05.212 --> 41:07.923
Gonna be a lot of hair.

41:11.844 --> 41:13.679
You wanna know Shannon's first kiss?
Tell them.

41:14.388 --> 41:17.766
It was Miss Spring Fling, 2002...

41:41.123 --> 41:42.625
Oh, my God, did you hear?

41:42.708 --> 41:43.542
What?

41:46.170 --> 41:49.507
-Fousey dumped Alexa?
-Shh! Nobody knows yet.

42:05.523 --> 42:06.649
Unbelievable!

42:08.234 --> 42:09.068
Hey!

42:09.860 --> 42:11.028
Thank God.

42:11.111 --> 42:13.155
Thought I was gonna have
to start digging holes to find you.

42:13.239 --> 42:15.407
Nice to see you, Freddie.

42:15.783 --> 42:18.077
Wow, got a new phone, too.

42:18.744 --> 42:20.579
What's that supposed to mean?

42:20.663 --> 42:22.665
Nothing. Never mind.

42:22.748 --> 42:26.293
I was just, uh, texting you
to remind you about the Bar...

42:26.377 --> 42:27.628
Bar Mitzvah?

42:28.462 --> 42:29.880
Yes, I remember.

42:29.964 --> 42:33.008
Saturday at seven.
I wouldn't forget your first paying gig.

42:34.969 --> 42:37.721
-Or the fact that you need a ride.
-Good.

42:37.805 --> 42:40.182
-I was thinking after the Bar Mitzvah...
-Dani!

42:40.266 --> 42:42.977
-...you and I can go to Biggie's together.
-Hi!

42:43.060 --> 42:44.353
How you doing?

42:45.437 --> 42:46.939
Hey, Freddie!

42:47.022 --> 42:49.483
Hey! What's up, bro?

42:50.067 --> 42:52.653
-Yeah, those some nice shoes.
-Oh, uh, thank you.

42:52.736 --> 42:54.738
Yeah. Oh, I got something for you.

42:54.822 --> 42:55.823
Oh?

42:55.906 --> 42:57.157
It's...

42:57.241 --> 42:59.118
- What is it?
- It's for Hodor.

42:59.577 --> 43:01.537
-I thought it may cheer him up.
-My gosh.

43:01.620 --> 43:03.038
How's his fundraiser going?

43:03.122 --> 43:05.583
Well, with your donation of $100,

43:05.666 --> 43:08.460
we now have $100.

43:08.544 --> 43:11.422
-It's all good. You'll get there.
-Yeah, it's all good, yo.

43:11.505 --> 43:12.923
See, he got it.

43:13.007 --> 43:14.592
What? What?

43:14.675 --> 43:16.927
That's the sound
of math class right there.

43:17.011 --> 43:18.429
May I escort you to class?

43:18.512 --> 43:21.724
You may, sir.

43:22.391 --> 43:23.309
Bye, Freddie.

43:23.392 --> 43:25.853
-Bye!
-Bye, Freddie. Good luck at the pep rally.

43:25.936 --> 43:28.188
-You got it.
-Yeah. "Good luck at the pep rally."

43:28.272 --> 43:30.774
- Huh?
- Uh, nothing, I just said thanks!

43:30.858 --> 43:31.692
All right.

43:35.821 --> 43:39.950
Everybody, let's give a warm welcome

43:40.034 --> 43:44.288
to the Vista Valley
High School cheerleaders!

43:44.371 --> 43:46.332
Whoo!

43:47.374 --> 43:49.418
Come out, ladies. Looking good!

43:50.002 --> 43:52.671
Come on! Make some noise!

43:55.966 --> 43:58.719
Yeah! Come on, Cougars.

43:58.802 --> 44:00.512
Yeah! Valley Vista!

44:03.849 --> 44:07.269
Valley Vista! Yes! Go Cougars!

44:09.772 --> 44:10.814
Yeah!

44:10.898 --> 44:11.899
All right, ladies!

44:45.724 --> 44:46.809
Freddie.

44:53.148 --> 44:54.233
Freddie!

44:59.113 --> 45:00.072
Kill the music!

45:01.949 --> 45:02.783
Turn the lights on!

45:05.619 --> 45:08.872
Thank you, ladies.

45:08.956 --> 45:11.417
All right. Thank you, ladies.
That's enough.

45:11.500 --> 45:14.044
Thank you, ladies and Randy.

45:14.795 --> 45:17.005
Suck my Dixon!

45:17.089 --> 45:20.384
Strike three, Broussard. My office! Now!

45:21.051 --> 45:22.553
I did it for you!

45:22.636 --> 45:24.513
- Go on!
- I did it for you!

45:24.596 --> 45:26.723
Go on! Keep it moving.
Get out of here.

45:27.724 --> 45:30.185
-I'm watching you.
-Yes, sir.

45:30.269 --> 45:32.646
Figure it out.

45:33.272 --> 45:35.733
All right! Let's give it up,
yo, one more time

45:35.816 --> 45:37.651
for the Crazy Horse cheerleaders!

45:37.734 --> 45:42.531
Oh, and here's our cheer captain
Kimmy!

45:44.116 --> 45:45.742
Thank you.

45:45.826 --> 45:48.454
What is up, Cougar fans?

45:48.537 --> 45:51.582
Don't forget to sign up
for the Senior Bonfire committee.

45:51.665 --> 45:55.794
-There will be a barbecue, a bake off...
-And hopefully the rest of Kimmy's dance!

45:55.878 --> 45:57.087
All right?

45:57.171 --> 45:59.465
And now the moment
you've all been waiting for.

45:59.548 --> 46:03.343
It's time to bring out some dudes who love
getting wet in their underwear.

46:03.427 --> 46:07.139
You know them
as your returning state champs.

46:07.222 --> 46:10.851
I know them as dudes who get praised
for doing something I learned at age five.

46:10.934 --> 46:13.353
Let's bring out the freshman fish!

46:13.437 --> 46:17.608
Here they are! Come on down! Whoo!

46:17.691 --> 46:18.859
Yeah!

46:18.942 --> 46:22.654
Hopefully a little faster in the water
than they are on the court. Huh? Yeah.

46:22.738 --> 46:24.823
All right, who's ready?

46:24.907 --> 46:28.202
Time to make these little heads
bald, shiny...

46:28.285 --> 46:29.953
I see you saved me a seat.

46:30.037 --> 46:32.915
Oh, actually,
this seat is taken.

46:32.998 --> 46:34.625
I get it. You're pissed.

46:35.209 --> 46:38.337
But the good news is I'm done
with Fousey and...

46:38.420 --> 46:39.922
I'm going to take you back.

46:41.256 --> 46:42.633
Actually, I'm not pissed.

46:42.716 --> 46:45.219
And it's exactly what I said,
someone else is sitting here.

46:46.678 --> 46:48.263
-Hi.
-Oh.

46:48.347 --> 46:50.432
- Hi.
- Whoo!

46:52.059 --> 46:55.229
Everybody, look!
Alexa's standing in the way of love!

47:00.484 --> 47:03.403
Broussard, get back to my office
and stay there!

47:03.487 --> 47:04.863
Miguel, Holly.

47:04.947 --> 47:06.365
-We want to watch the pep rally.
-Yeah.

47:08.116 --> 47:11.245
And now for the sophomore ritual.

47:11.829 --> 47:15.833
Shave! Shave! Shave!
Shave! Shave! Shave!

47:15.916 --> 47:17.417
Shave! Shave!

47:51.493 --> 47:54.121
If your friend posts a picture
and she's really your friend,

47:54.204 --> 47:55.998
you have to respond
with something like,

47:56.081 --> 47:59.251
"OMG, perfect! Who needs Harvard
with hair like that?"

47:59.334 --> 48:02.004
Taylor, I just wanted you
to help me get donations.

48:02.087 --> 48:04.131
Oh. I don't know how to do that.

48:06.592 --> 48:07.968
I'll get it!

48:12.139 --> 48:14.141
Hi! Is Dani here?

48:14.808 --> 48:15.976
Oh! Are you okay?

48:17.644 --> 48:18.854
Is she okay?

48:18.937 --> 48:22.149
She did the same thing when she met Olaf
at Disneyland. She's fine.

48:24.526 --> 48:26.069
I came to talk to you.

48:26.153 --> 48:27.905
Sure, come on in.

48:28.530 --> 48:30.866
-I was a real bitch to you.
-Which time?

48:30.949 --> 48:31.992
I deserve that.

48:32.075 --> 48:34.911
I just came to say sorry.

48:35.871 --> 48:38.790
Last week at the pep rally,
people were doing the same thing to me

48:38.874 --> 48:40.709
that I had been doing to you and...

48:40.792 --> 48:42.669
I felt like shit.

48:42.753 --> 48:44.254
Okay.

48:44.338 --> 48:46.632
I want us to be friends again.

48:46.715 --> 48:49.384
- I don't know.
- Look...

48:51.386 --> 48:53.764
Remember this... from camp?

48:54.473 --> 48:55.641
You were my best friend.

48:56.642 --> 49:01.521
We used to be really close, and I know
it's my fault that we're not anymore.

49:02.356 --> 49:06.068
I'm not saying we'll get back to that,
but I'd like to at least try.

49:13.533 --> 49:15.118
I can't believe you kept this.

49:15.619 --> 49:17.412
Awesome!

49:17.496 --> 49:20.499
Should we, like, hug or something?

49:20.582 --> 49:23.126
Oh, no, that's fine.
We don't have to...

49:25.754 --> 49:27.673
Oh, my God. It's gonna be great.

49:27.756 --> 49:32.052
This is so exciting! Oh, my God!
We're gonna be BFFs again.

49:32.135 --> 49:34.763
Well, I need to leave now, but...

49:34.846 --> 49:36.431
-Oh, okay.
-I'll see ya soon.

49:36.515 --> 49:38.642
Adios , bebita!  Bye!

49:38.725 --> 49:41.728
Adios ...   amiga .

49:41.812 --> 49:43.438
Taylor, you can get up now.

49:44.981 --> 49:48.610
OMG, are you and Alexa like BFFs now?
This is gonna change my life.

49:53.615 --> 49:55.951
-My God.
-Let's get a pump in.

49:56.034 --> 49:56.868
What do you say?

49:57.577 --> 49:58.620
Oh, yeah.

49:59.454 --> 50:00.956
-Yeah!
-What are you doing?

50:01.039 --> 50:03.083
- You look like an idiot.
- Why?

50:03.166 --> 50:05.836
'Cause I got this sexy girl on my back
with her legs wrapped around my waist

50:05.919 --> 50:07.587
while I murder these squats?

50:07.671 --> 50:09.297
Ooh, you're just jealous.

50:09.381 --> 50:12.300
-In your dreams.
-Mm, looking good.

50:12.384 --> 50:14.761
Thanks. She'll be done by the Bonfire.

50:14.845 --> 50:16.221
Maybe I can pick you up?

50:16.888 --> 50:18.098
Maybe.

50:18.724 --> 50:20.058
I'm really proud of you.

50:20.142 --> 50:23.228
I can't believe that Fox Sports wants
to do a story on you.

50:23.311 --> 50:24.396
That's awesome.

50:24.479 --> 50:27.107
Yeah,
as long as they don't ask me about school.

50:27.190 --> 50:28.191
That's all.

50:28.275 --> 50:30.986
I'm already nervous enough
about being on TV.

50:31.069 --> 50:32.779
Don't worry, I'll be there.

50:34.531 --> 50:36.700
Get a room.

50:36.783 --> 50:37.909
Hey, guys!

50:37.993 --> 50:39.077
Look what I brought.

50:39.161 --> 50:41.538
-Cops.
-Best tequila in town.

50:41.621 --> 50:43.957
-Girl, I was blowing up your phone.
-I know.

50:44.041 --> 50:45.792
-Hi,  bebita!
-Oh.

50:47.711 --> 50:49.546
What is this?
Why are you guys hugging?

50:50.130 --> 50:53.925
Well, I apologized
for being a raging bitch,

50:54.301 --> 50:55.677
but we're all friends now.

50:57.471 --> 51:01.391
-Dani's going shopping with us tomorrow.
-Wait, I am?

51:01.475 --> 51:02.434
-She is?
-Yeah.

51:02.517 --> 51:04.728
-That's new.
-Come with us, Dani.

51:04.811 --> 51:07.272
She gets free stuff
if we post while she shops.

51:07.355 --> 51:08.940
- Yeah.
- I got school.

51:09.024 --> 51:11.943
-Don't you got work tomorrow?
-Um, yeah, yeah.

51:12.027 --> 51:16.072
I have to work on a fundraiser
for this dog.

51:16.156 --> 51:18.700
Why don't you do a GoFundMe,  bebita?

51:19.534 --> 51:20.744
-I did.
-It's so simple.

51:20.827 --> 51:23.121
I posted it on my wall,

51:23.205 --> 51:27.292
but unless you're Kylie Jenner, you can't
really make any money from that stuff.

51:28.126 --> 51:29.336
Give me one sec.

51:30.629 --> 51:34.216
You sure you wanna do this?
This is Alexa we're talking about.

51:34.299 --> 51:37.427
I know, but we said
we were gonna try to be friends.

51:37.511 --> 51:39.679
I don't trust her.

51:40.889 --> 51:42.098
I'll be fine.

51:43.183 --> 51:45.101
- Cam, come on.
- If you say so.

51:48.605 --> 51:50.023
It's settled!

51:50.106 --> 51:52.317
You're coming with us tomorrow.

51:55.195 --> 52:00.325
Whoa! Oh, my gosh!
Alexa, thank you so much!

52:00.408 --> 52:01.243
Of course.

52:01.326 --> 52:03.411
Cam, this is crazy.

52:03.495 --> 52:06.623
Hey, let's celebrate.
Let's take a selfie together. Come on!

52:06.706 --> 52:08.375
I guess I'm going shopping.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.294
Guys, let's take a selfie.

52:11.920 --> 52:14.214
-Cheese!
-Guys!

52:30.105 --> 52:31.356
Sit down, Miguel.

52:31.439 --> 52:33.441
-Ooh!
-It looks like you have palsy.

52:33.525 --> 52:37.070
Lame!

52:37.153 --> 52:39.990
Hey, I texted you like
five minutes ago about my pic.

52:40.073 --> 52:41.449
Why haven't you liked it yet?

52:41.533 --> 52:42.909
Because it's lame.

52:43.368 --> 52:44.828
-What?
-Miguel?

52:44.911 --> 52:46.079
Thank you.

52:46.705 --> 52:48.206
I thought your photo was nice.

52:48.290 --> 52:49.457
Thank you.

52:49.541 --> 52:50.750
Whoo!

52:50.834 --> 52:52.669
Let's take a selfie, guys!

52:54.045 --> 52:57.299
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

53:07.601 --> 53:09.144
What is she doing?

53:14.232 --> 53:16.985
Hola, babies.
Today I'm going to show you

53:17.068 --> 53:18.653
some of my favorite stores in Malibu.

53:19.738 --> 53:21.031
Hey, can you move?

53:21.907 --> 53:24.034
No, no, no. Not you,  bebita.

53:24.117 --> 53:25.785
Miguel, you're in my shot.

53:26.578 --> 53:28.121
Come here.

53:30.123 --> 53:31.291
Let's go.

53:35.879 --> 53:37.797
Oh, my God, they're so cute.

53:37.881 --> 53:40.467
You should definitely get them.

53:41.009 --> 53:43.678
Holly and the girls are in Malibu.
You guys wanna hit 'em up?

53:44.429 --> 53:46.014
No, I'm good.

53:46.097 --> 53:47.182
Oh, my God.

53:47.265 --> 53:51.227
We have over 50,000 likes
on one of our pics. Squad goals!

53:51.311 --> 53:53.146
Good for you, Miguel.

53:53.230 --> 53:55.482
I can't believe you are getting
all this for free.

53:55.565 --> 53:58.985
Look, these shoes are $400.

53:59.527 --> 54:01.947
Oh, my bad, shoes aren't included.

54:02.030 --> 54:03.823
But you have
your dad's credit card, right?

54:04.783 --> 54:06.117
-Yeah!
-Great!

54:06.201 --> 54:09.412
-Mm-hmm.
-I'm not sure if I brought it.

54:09.496 --> 54:11.414
-That one.
-Thank you.

54:12.332 --> 54:16.962
Great, great, great. Now we have options
for Kid Ink's party tonight.

54:17.045 --> 54:18.630
-Ooh!
-Kid Ink?

54:18.713 --> 54:20.799
Yeah. You're invited,  bebita.

54:20.882 --> 54:23.426
-Yeah, come with us.
-Yeah, come.

54:23.510 --> 54:25.136
Oh!

54:25.220 --> 54:27.013
You don't have to sell me on Kid Ink!

54:43.113 --> 54:45.323
Dani, it's Freddie again.

54:45.407 --> 54:48.076
Just checking your ETA.
Where the hell are you?

54:59.129 --> 55:02.215
-Phones need to be turned over.
-It's okay. You'll get it back.

55:02.298 --> 55:04.384
Yeah. Thank you.

55:40.879 --> 55:43.339
Oh, no, I don't do shots.

55:43.423 --> 55:45.925
-Oh.
-Dani, come on!

55:46.009 --> 55:48.261
-Do it.
-Yeah!

55:50.930 --> 55:52.682
-Oh.
-Let's do another one!

55:52.766 --> 55:54.642
-Another round, please.
-Oh, my God!

55:54.726 --> 55:57.270
I'm gonna go find the bathroom.
I'll be right back.

55:57.353 --> 55:59.397
Come on! Okay, okay, okay!

55:59.481 --> 56:00.440
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

56:04.194 --> 56:06.029
Screw it.

56:16.498 --> 56:17.374
Oh.

56:20.335 --> 56:21.711
Hi, old boy.

56:23.171 --> 56:25.048
Ah. I know.

56:26.132 --> 56:27.926
Yo! You trying to steal my dog?

56:28.009 --> 56:29.552
Oh, no, um...

56:30.512 --> 56:31.888
Oh, my God.

56:33.807 --> 56:35.100
You're Kid Ink.

56:36.476 --> 56:38.895
I'm sorry.
I was looking for the bathroom and--

56:38.978 --> 56:41.564
-Yo, yo. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
-Okay.

56:41.648 --> 56:45.402
Ozzie doesn't get along with many people
so you must be a dog person.

56:46.444 --> 56:49.114
I am. I volunteer at a rescue.

56:49.197 --> 56:50.990
-Oh, yeah, which rescue?
-Bark.

56:51.074 --> 56:52.659
Oh, really? Yeah, that's crazy.

56:52.742 --> 56:54.786
I got Ozzie from Bark
when he was a puppy.

56:54.869 --> 56:57.664
Oh, that's crazy! I volunteer at Bark.

56:58.248 --> 56:59.499
-I just said that.
-Yeah.

56:59.582 --> 57:01.876
-I really like your dog.
-Yeah. Thank you.

57:01.960 --> 57:05.922
-And, uh, your name was?
-Dani Barnes.

57:06.005 --> 57:07.257
"Dani Barnes."

57:07.340 --> 57:09.717
-Nice to meet you, Dani.
-Nice to meet you.

57:09.801 --> 57:13.263
Thank you for everything you do.
I love animals, so I'm into it all.

57:13.346 --> 57:15.098
There you are!

57:17.267 --> 57:18.435
Hola ,  Ink.

57:18.518 --> 57:19.727
Bes.

57:20.895 --> 57:22.063
Good to see you.

57:22.147 --> 57:23.857
-Hi.
-You look amazing.

57:23.940 --> 57:25.817
-Thank you.
-Ink, we need you here!

57:27.318 --> 57:30.363
I gotta get out of here.
It was good to meet you, Miss Barnes.

57:30.447 --> 57:31.865
Nice, nice to--

57:31.948 --> 57:33.533
Bye, Mr. Ink!

57:34.909 --> 57:36.911
-Oh, my God!
-That's crazy.

57:36.995 --> 57:39.622
-Where are you right now?
-I'm trying to find Dani.

57:40.457 --> 57:42.584
-All right?
-Dani's where Dani is, okay?

57:42.667 --> 57:44.461
The boys are where the boys are.

58:07.150 --> 58:09.068
All right, ladies, it's been a joy.

58:19.245 --> 58:20.497
Oh, shit, my laptop!

58:21.039 --> 58:22.999
My laptop! Stop!

58:23.666 --> 58:26.669
Hey, come on, Dude! Dude!
Stop the car!

58:57.325 --> 58:59.035
We need to get some food in you.

59:04.290 --> 59:08.086
You know, he actually looks like
a nice person when he's sleeping.

59:09.170 --> 59:10.672
I'm sorry, that was mean.

59:12.131 --> 59:14.342
Don't apologize. Hey.

59:19.013 --> 59:20.723
I can see why Cameron likes you.

59:21.808 --> 59:22.767
Oh...

59:23.601 --> 59:25.603
Oh, is that weird to bring up?

59:26.187 --> 59:29.732
No, no.
I mean, as long as it's not weird for you.

59:29.816 --> 59:31.985
No way! I've moved on.

59:33.987 --> 59:37.156
One vegetable frittata.
One huevos rancheros.

59:37.240 --> 59:38.533
Thank you very much, sir.

59:38.616 --> 59:40.577
Gracias, Alfred.

59:43.621 --> 59:46.291
-Can I tell you something?
-Sure.

59:46.374 --> 59:48.543
That whole prank thing at camp...

59:50.003 --> 59:52.005
I did it because I was jealous.

59:52.380 --> 59:53.464
I know.

59:53.548 --> 59:56.634
Cameron told me that
you knew he had a crush on me.

59:56.718 --> 59:57.802
What?

59:58.428 --> 59:59.262
No.

59:59.345 --> 01:00:02.098
I was jealous because
my parents had just split up,

01:00:02.181 --> 01:00:03.683
and yours were still together.

01:00:05.351 --> 01:00:06.811
I had no idea.

01:00:07.854 --> 01:00:09.856
I was always jealous of you.

01:00:11.357 --> 01:00:13.860
Everyone in school worships you.

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:16.738
Look at all of this.

01:00:16.821 --> 01:00:18.114
You live like a...

01:00:19.824 --> 01:00:20.992
princess.

01:00:24.329 --> 01:00:27.915
I wish I could just be normal
and eat a freaking donut.

01:00:28.708 --> 01:00:31.336
Every day it's like,  "Mija,  date him.

01:00:31.419 --> 01:00:33.880
Don't wear that.
Spit that out, you look fat!"

01:00:33.963 --> 01:00:37.175
-Someone said that to you?
-Yeah, my mom.

01:00:38.509 --> 01:00:40.845
Every part of my life just feels fake.

01:00:40.928 --> 01:00:43.264
I don't even know who I am sometimes.

01:00:44.432 --> 01:00:48.436
No, you're Alexa Medina.

01:00:49.604 --> 01:00:52.231
You're beautiful and you're funny...

01:00:52.899 --> 01:00:54.400
and smart.

01:00:57.445 --> 01:00:59.572
I didn't know you were paying attention.

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:01.949
Well, it's not like...

01:01:02.867 --> 01:01:05.745
"I'm obsessed with your life!"

01:01:07.955 --> 01:01:12.293
You know, but my sister,
she watches you 24/7.

01:01:12.377 --> 01:01:15.046
If she were here, this is what she'd say.
Are you ready?

01:01:15.129 --> 01:01:18.049
"I watch you on YouTube.

01:01:18.132 --> 01:01:21.803
I watch you on Instagram..."

01:01:23.388 --> 01:01:25.431
-Shit!
-What?

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:26.432
-Freddie!
-What?

01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:28.184
-Oh, my God!
-What?

01:01:28.267 --> 01:01:30.186
I'm gonna-- oh, my God!

01:01:30.269 --> 01:01:31.896
-I'm gonna puke.
-No, no, no, no.

01:01:31.979 --> 01:01:35.316
The bathroom's down that hallway,
the fifth door on the right. No!

01:01:37.318 --> 01:01:38.820
-Sorry.
-Alfred!

01:01:39.862 --> 01:01:40.738
Come on!

01:01:43.324 --> 01:01:46.202
Whoa, Dani, you look great.

01:01:46.285 --> 01:01:48.329
Danielle, you've blossomed this year.

01:01:48.413 --> 01:01:49.706
Oh, pervert.

01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:51.541
Come on! Broussard, let's go.

01:01:51.624 --> 01:01:53.209
-If you're gonna...
-My office!

01:01:53.292 --> 01:01:56.421
Freddie, answer your phone.
You can't ignore me forever.

01:02:01.134 --> 01:02:07.807
Ba-ruch a-tah
a-do-nai eh-lo-hay-nu meh-lech ha-o-lahm.

01:02:08.516 --> 01:02:10.643
-A-sher ba-char.
-Freddie...

01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:14.564
That's a bit of the blessing
that a boy says at a Bar Mitzvah.

01:02:14.647 --> 01:02:16.274
It's a part of the blessing that I missed

01:02:16.357 --> 01:02:19.318
because my best friend forgot
to pick me up.

01:02:20.319 --> 01:02:23.948
I had to play my first paying gig for free
because I was two hours late.

01:02:24.031 --> 01:02:26.367
Okay, I tried calling you,
but you didn't answer.

01:02:26.451 --> 01:02:30.371
One second, I was in Malibu shopping
and the next at Kid Ink's party!

01:02:30.455 --> 01:02:31.664
I lost track of time!

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:33.708
Yeah, you couldn't have texted or...?

01:02:33.791 --> 01:02:35.293
They took our phones at the door.

01:02:35.376 --> 01:02:37.211
It's this weird celebrity thing.
I don't know.

01:02:37.295 --> 01:02:39.005
Oh, excuse me.

01:02:39.088 --> 01:02:41.924
I didn't realize you hang out
with these people for a couple weeks

01:02:42.008 --> 01:02:42.925
and you're a celebrity.

01:02:43.843 --> 01:02:44.927
Look...

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:46.637
I messed up.

01:02:47.388 --> 01:02:48.723
I'm sorry.

01:02:49.307 --> 01:02:51.559
I don't accept your apology.

01:02:51.642 --> 01:02:53.561
Why are you being such a jerk?

01:02:53.644 --> 01:02:55.521
-Why are you so selfish?
-I'm selfish?

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:56.481
Yeah.

01:02:56.564 --> 01:03:00.568
I'm sorry, you wanted me
to skip hanging out with Kid Ink

01:03:00.651 --> 01:03:03.821
so that I could drive you
to some 13-year-old's birthday party?

01:03:03.905 --> 01:03:06.949
I just had the best night of my life.
Why can't you be happy for me?

01:03:07.033 --> 01:03:08.242
Fine.

01:03:09.535 --> 01:03:10.620
I'm happy for you.

01:03:10.703 --> 01:03:13.372
Have fun with
your new fake friends.

01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:17.043
Just because they're cool
and you're not, Freddie...

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:20.171
-doesn't mean they're fake.
-No, they're fake.

01:03:20.838 --> 01:03:24.675
It's just that you fit in now
so you don't realize it.

01:03:43.361 --> 01:03:46.280
So, how's it going with Freddie?

01:03:46.364 --> 01:03:47.824
It's not.

01:03:48.699 --> 01:03:51.577
What? So, you guys still haven't talked?

01:03:52.119 --> 01:03:53.996
Can we please change the subject?

01:03:55.081 --> 01:03:59.001
Okay, have you heard back
about the scholarship yet?

01:03:59.085 --> 01:04:00.044
No.

01:04:00.127 --> 01:04:03.756
By "change the subject," I mean
to something that's not stressing me out.

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.675
All right, all right.

01:04:05.758 --> 01:04:06.884
Um, well...

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:10.304
Well, we can talk about this.

01:04:10.388 --> 01:04:11.264
What is it?

01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:16.185
Well, you know,
my acceptance letter to UCLA. Yeah.

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:20.022
Some girl told me to follow my heart.
I figured, "Why don't I follow my heart?"

01:04:20.106 --> 01:04:22.024
Cam, this is amazing!

01:04:22.108 --> 01:04:24.777
What did your dad say?

01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:28.781
I haven't exactly told him,

01:04:28.865 --> 01:04:31.242
but with the meet tonight and um...

01:04:31.325 --> 01:04:33.494
and the Fox Sports thing after, I...

01:04:34.662 --> 01:04:36.622
-Hello!
-Oh, my God.

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.876
-Holy shit.
-What?

01:04:41.335 --> 01:04:43.170
Alexa just texted me.

01:04:43.254 --> 01:04:45.715
I'm gonna be on
Hashtag Reality High  this week.

01:04:45.798 --> 01:04:47.884
Taylor is gonna flip!

01:04:47.967 --> 01:04:49.176
Oh.

01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:50.761
I have to go meet the girls.

01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:54.056
But, um, I'll see you later at the meet.

01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:56.142
Yeah, sure. Um...

01:04:56.225 --> 01:04:58.436
-Oh.
-You're gonna kill it. Later, babe!

01:05:11.449 --> 01:05:13.951
Thanks for coming out.
You're gonna see something special today.

01:05:14.035 --> 01:05:15.745
-Heard great things.
-Meet my son Cam.

01:05:15.828 --> 01:05:17.038
-How you doing?
-Great.

01:05:17.121 --> 01:05:18.581
-Good to meet you.
-Likewise.

01:05:18.664 --> 01:05:20.625
-You ready to get started?
-We sure are.

01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:25.171
-Dad's excited.
-You don't know the half of it.

01:05:25.254 --> 01:05:27.757
All right.

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.634
So, Cameron, tell me.

01:05:29.717 --> 01:05:32.011
What's it like to be called
the next Michael Phelps?

01:05:32.970 --> 01:05:34.764
Aw, man, well--

01:05:34.847 --> 01:05:37.183
Oops.

01:05:37.266 --> 01:05:39.310
- You guys.
- Shh.

01:05:39.393 --> 01:05:41.187
Sorry! Sorry.

01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:43.606
You guys, come.

01:05:43.689 --> 01:05:45.608
-Shh!
-Sit, sit, sit up here.

01:05:45.691 --> 01:05:47.443
Look, I'm sorry about that.

01:05:47.526 --> 01:05:49.403
Shit, sorry.

01:05:50.529 --> 01:05:51.864
Don't mind us!

01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:52.907
Shh.

01:05:53.741 --> 01:05:57.370
It's all good. So, people are saying
you're the next Michael Phelps.

01:05:58.371 --> 01:06:01.082
Well, man,
I wouldn't say all that, right?

01:06:01.165 --> 01:06:02.667
Now, don't be modest.

01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:06.295
You've built this program to
national prominence one stroke at a time.

01:06:06.379 --> 01:06:08.464
He said stroke!

01:06:10.841 --> 01:06:13.469
Um, can you just--

01:06:13.552 --> 01:06:16.847
can you just give me one second?
I'm sorry.

01:06:20.518 --> 01:06:22.979
-Can I talk to you for a second?
-Hey, Cameron!

01:06:23.646 --> 01:06:24.939
Oh, okay.

01:06:26.315 --> 01:06:27.733
What the hell are you doing?

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:29.735
I'm supporting you.

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:33.030
How? By missing my meet,
then showing up drunk?

01:06:33.656 --> 01:06:36.158
- Oh.
- Did you see how pissed my dad was?

01:06:36.242 --> 01:06:37.952
I still have to talk to him about UCLA.

01:06:38.035 --> 01:06:41.872
Okay, hashtag first-world problems.

01:06:41.956 --> 01:06:43.374
Okay, Alexa.

01:06:44.083 --> 01:06:48.087
Hey, don't be mad at me just because
you're too scared to talk to your dad.

01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:49.964
I can't believe you.

01:06:50.047 --> 01:06:52.800
Why?
What is your worst case scenario here?

01:06:53.384 --> 01:06:54.802
Okay, you go to college?

01:06:54.885 --> 01:06:57.221
-Go to the Olympics?
-Keep it down.

01:06:57.304 --> 01:06:59.557
You go to college and the Olympics?

01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:03.060
I don't know if I can go to my dream
school, because I can't afford it.

01:07:03.144 --> 01:07:05.646
And you're here bitching about
all your options.

01:07:05.730 --> 01:07:07.189
You don't get it.

01:07:07.273 --> 01:07:09.025
I do, actually.

01:07:09.108 --> 01:07:10.359
It's simple.

01:07:11.152 --> 01:07:15.823
You go to your dad, and you say,
"Hey, Dad, I'm going to UCLA!"

01:07:15.906 --> 01:07:17.700
- Please be quiet.
- Is that true?

01:07:20.286 --> 01:07:22.538
-You need to get back to the interview.
-Uh...

01:07:23.456 --> 01:07:25.458
-Just give me a second, Dad, please.
-One minute.

01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:29.503
-I didn't know he was standing--
-Whatever. What's done is done.

01:07:30.463 --> 01:07:31.464
I'm sorry.

01:07:32.423 --> 01:07:35.634
I don't know
what's going on with you right now,

01:07:36.135 --> 01:07:37.845
but I don't want to be around this Dani.

01:07:38.471 --> 01:07:39.722
What are you saying?

01:07:40.598 --> 01:07:42.933
I'm saying I don't think
we should be together.

01:07:44.268 --> 01:07:45.561
I'll see you around.

01:08:09.126 --> 01:08:11.295
-Have you guys seen Fiona?
-Yeah, there.

01:08:11.378 --> 01:08:12.588
She's over there.

01:08:15.591 --> 01:08:18.051
Fiona, I don't know what to do.

01:08:18.135 --> 01:08:20.054
-Last night Cameron--
-Stop.

01:08:20.763 --> 01:08:24.517
We lost the venue for the adoption event,
because you didn't submit the permit.

01:08:25.059 --> 01:08:26.519
Oh, my God.

01:08:27.685 --> 01:08:29.522
Fiona, I'm so sorry.

01:08:30.397 --> 01:08:32.691
Sorry doesn't get us a new venue.

01:08:32.774 --> 01:08:37.071
-I meant to do it, but I just forgot.
-What do you mean you just forgot?

01:08:37.154 --> 01:08:39.156
I was out having fun.

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:42.701
-You told me to let loose.
-I didn't say shirk your responsibilities.

01:08:42.785 --> 01:08:45.578
If you can't handle your social life
with work now,

01:08:45.662 --> 01:08:47.288
you've got no chance at Davis.

01:08:48.415 --> 01:08:50.376
-Meaning?
-Meaning...

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:53.754
I told you I was very serious
about my recommendations.

01:08:53.837 --> 01:08:55.714
If you want one, you better fix this.

01:08:55.798 --> 01:08:58.676
How am I supposed to get a venue
at such short notice?

01:08:58.759 --> 01:09:00.803
I don't know. I hope you figure it out.

01:09:08.018 --> 01:09:10.688
45, 46, 47...

01:09:10.770 --> 01:09:12.648
989, 999...

01:09:12.731 --> 01:09:14.191
Infinity. Infinity.

01:09:14.274 --> 01:09:16.277
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:09:17.361 --> 01:09:18.444
Sorry I'm late.

01:09:18.529 --> 01:09:20.531
-Hey, Dani.
-It's all good.

01:09:20.613 --> 01:09:21.740
I waited for you.

01:09:22.366 --> 01:09:23.993
I just tweeted a link to the video.

01:09:24.076 --> 01:09:25.661
-Oh, okay.
-All right.

01:09:25.743 --> 01:09:27.872
Cheer up, bitch,
you're about to be famous.

01:09:27.955 --> 01:09:28.872
-Whoo!
-Stop.

01:09:29.915 --> 01:09:31.625
-Are you guys ready?
-Yeah.

01:09:31.709 --> 01:09:34.920
One, two, three.

01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:36.171
Hola , bebes.

01:09:36.255 --> 01:09:39.175
This is  Hashtag Reality High,
with me, Alexa Medina.

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:42.303
You know, parents can be mad annoying.

01:09:42.386 --> 01:09:46.140
I mean, I love my mom,
but sometimes she can be overbearing.

01:09:46.223 --> 01:09:47.975
I've got great news for you,  mija.

01:09:48.809 --> 01:09:52.062
You are going to be shooting the cover
of  Teen Vogue  tomorrow.

01:09:52.145 --> 01:09:55.399
-Like, telling you what to do.
-Mama, I have a test tomorrow.

01:09:55.482 --> 01:09:57.234
You can go to the school any day.

01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:01.197
The cover of  Teen Vogue,
you can only do when you have...

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:03.324
- Ay, Mami!
-...breasts.

01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:09.246
Jesus. Somebody oughta nominate
this lady for Mom of the Year.

01:10:09.330 --> 01:10:10.539
I know, right!

01:10:10.623 --> 01:10:12.458
You know what's worse than parents?

01:10:13.125 --> 01:10:14.835
Stalkers.

01:10:14.919 --> 01:10:17.171
Today, we're going to talk about that.

01:10:17.254 --> 01:10:20.132
I know, she looks unhinged,
and I felt bad for her,

01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:21.884
so I took her under my wing.

01:10:27.223 --> 01:10:28.891
I was always jealous of you.

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:34.813
I mean, everyone at school worshipped you.
And look at this place.

01:10:34.897 --> 01:10:36.315
-You live like a...
-Aw...

01:10:36.398 --> 01:10:38.234
Like a princess.

01:10:39.735 --> 01:10:42.446
I'm obsessed with your life!

01:10:42.529 --> 01:10:45.366
I watch you on YouTube.
I watch you on Snapchat.

01:10:45.449 --> 01:10:46.951
I follow you on Instagram.

01:10:47.034 --> 01:10:48.160
Creepy.

01:10:48.244 --> 01:10:50.996
her dressing like me,

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:54.875
showing up at our hangout,
even dating my sloppy seconds.

01:10:54.959 --> 01:10:56.418
Her name is Dani Barnes.

01:10:56.502 --> 01:10:58.087
We used to be close friends.

01:10:58.671 --> 01:11:00.005
Honey, come check this out!

01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:01.090
She needs help.

01:11:02.591 --> 01:11:04.843
I think she has a drinking problem, too.

01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:08.722
The bathroom's down the hallway,
the fifth door on the right. Hey! No!

01:11:08.806 --> 01:11:12.601
I'm just saying, guys,
this time happened to me,

01:11:12.685 --> 01:11:16.438
next time it could be you.
Just be careful out there.

01:11:25.656 --> 01:11:28.450
I can't believe I was stupid enough
to trust you.

01:11:28.534 --> 01:11:30.953
Yeah, pretty stupid.

01:11:36.792 --> 01:11:37.918
What?

01:11:38.585 --> 01:11:42.006
You thought I was just gonna let her
steal my boyfriend and embarrass me?

01:11:44.258 --> 01:11:45.134
Get out.

01:11:49.221 --> 01:11:50.681
You need to leave.

01:12:26.133 --> 01:12:28.135
Dani? Are you okay, baby?

01:12:31.889 --> 01:12:33.349
I'm fine.

01:12:34.224 --> 01:12:35.851
I just dropped something.

01:12:36.935 --> 01:12:38.354
Are you sure?

01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:41.106
Please just leave me alone.

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:43.817
Okay. I'm here if you need me.

01:13:14.306 --> 01:13:16.433
I can't believe she fell for it.

01:13:16.517 --> 01:13:19.269
Leave her alone, jerks!

01:13:19.353 --> 01:13:20.729
Thanks, Freddie.

01:13:20.813 --> 01:13:22.356
You're my best friend.

01:13:29.363 --> 01:13:32.950
So today, we are going to be talking
about the Cold War.

01:13:33.033 --> 01:13:33.867
Brr.

01:13:33.951 --> 01:13:36.870
If it were then, I'd be teaching you
to hide under your desk,

01:13:36.954 --> 01:13:39.331
like that would somehow help
with the bomb.

01:13:39.415 --> 01:13:41.208
You are late, Ms. Barnes.

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:45.754
You wanna open up your textbook please
to page 198.

01:13:45.838 --> 01:13:47.464
Stalker!

01:13:47.548 --> 01:13:50.217
If you want to keep that phone,
you better put it away.

01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:51.260
Thank you.

01:13:52.010 --> 01:13:54.680
Okay, everybody, settle down.

01:13:57.266 --> 01:14:01.061
So, the Cold War,
this is a very scary time.

01:14:01.145 --> 01:14:04.398
Think about it like this:

01:14:04.481 --> 01:14:07.776
the US was... Taylor Swift

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:11.864
-and the USSR was Taylor Lautner...
-Streak! Everyone's in there.

01:14:11.947 --> 01:14:14.450
Harry Styles or Tom Hiddleston.

01:14:14.533 --> 01:14:18.162
I'm not the only one.
I'm not the only one, there's more coming.

01:14:18.245 --> 01:14:19.371
Streaking!

01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:22.458
You guys look so stupid right now.

01:14:22.541 --> 01:14:23.459
Broussard!

01:14:24.251 --> 01:14:26.128
-Broussard!
-Shit!

01:14:26.211 --> 01:14:28.922
- Hey! Stay in class!
- Come on, Broussard, run!

01:14:29.006 --> 01:14:31.133
Broussard, god damn it! Get back here!

01:14:31.258 --> 01:14:33.677
Wow, they are killing Dani online.

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:35.220
Yeah, those memes are cruel.

01:14:35.304 --> 01:14:37.264
She has no one to blame but herself.

01:14:38.307 --> 01:14:40.350
I'm pretty sure she could blame you.

01:14:40.434 --> 01:14:43.729
She made me look like an idiot
in front of the entire school.

01:14:43.812 --> 01:14:46.106
You did a pretty good job
of that yourself.

01:14:50.068 --> 01:14:52.404
That was really messed up, even for you.

01:14:52.488 --> 01:14:53.697
I'm out of here.

01:15:03.207 --> 01:15:04.416
Dani?

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:07.836
I just wanted to let you know
I think it's really lame what Alexa did,

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:09.379
and I stopped following her.

01:15:09.922 --> 01:15:11.423
Thanks, T.

01:15:11.507 --> 01:15:14.259
And if you wanna talk,
you know where my room is.

01:15:15.093 --> 01:15:16.762
Maybe later, okay?

01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:20.557
Okay.

01:15:31.193 --> 01:15:34.112
Taylor, please just leave me alone.

01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:36.448
Hey, baby girl.

01:15:36.532 --> 01:15:37.824
May I come in?

01:15:45.165 --> 01:15:48.544
So how you doing?

01:15:48.627 --> 01:15:50.963
-You okay?
-Dad, I really don't wanna talk...

01:15:51.046 --> 01:15:52.923
You're gonna have to.

01:15:53.006 --> 01:15:58.053
I may not seem like it,
but I notice a lot of stuff around here.

01:15:58.136 --> 01:15:59.930
-Really?
-Yes.

01:16:00.472 --> 01:16:03.642
I let your mom handle most of it,
because I've never been a teenage girl.

01:16:04.184 --> 01:16:08.564
Or any age girl for that matter,
but you're acting like a dumb ass.

01:16:08.647 --> 01:16:11.233
Wow. Now I see why
you let mom give the talks.

01:16:11.316 --> 01:16:12.609
I know you feel like crap,

01:16:12.693 --> 01:16:15.988
and I can't imagine being embarrassed
in front of the whole world,

01:16:16.071 --> 01:16:18.740
but this past month,
you've been losing yourself,

01:16:18.824 --> 01:16:21.827
trying to keep up with girls
who aren't even in your league.

01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:23.537
Dad, you don't understand.

01:16:24.538 --> 01:16:27.499
Everyone at school thinks
I'm some obsessed stalker.

01:16:27.583 --> 01:16:29.001
But you're not, right?

01:16:29.918 --> 01:16:30.752
Right.

01:16:31.461 --> 01:16:33.297
So who cares what they think?

01:16:33.755 --> 01:16:36.758
When you graduate,
you won't see half of those people again.

01:16:36.842 --> 01:16:39.052
I still have to go to school until then.

01:16:43.890 --> 01:16:46.810
Focus on what's important to you.

01:16:47.644 --> 01:16:49.855
And everything else will fall into place.

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:52.816
You're still my Dani.

01:16:54.484 --> 01:16:56.612
You're one
of the smartest people I've ever met.

01:16:59.156 --> 01:17:00.616
I know you'll figure it out.

01:17:04.786 --> 01:17:06.622
Oh, I almost forgot--

01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:11.043
Thank you.

01:17:16.048 --> 01:17:18.675
-You still owe me $400.
-Okay.

01:17:23.889 --> 01:17:25.015
Good night, baby girl.

01:17:25.098 --> 01:17:26.266
Night.

01:17:36.485 --> 01:17:37.944
Grams.

01:17:38.028 --> 01:17:40.238
I already told you,
I don't want a fuzzy navel!

01:17:43.367 --> 01:17:44.701
Stop!

01:17:44.785 --> 01:17:47.204
Oh, fine. I'm coming.

01:17:48.830 --> 01:17:51.166
Grams, get a hobby! Seriously!

01:17:51.249 --> 01:17:52.376
What?

01:17:54.336 --> 01:17:55.712
How about an apology?

01:17:56.338 --> 01:17:57.881
I thought we already did that.

01:17:58.298 --> 01:17:59.174
Oh!

01:18:02.469 --> 01:18:03.553
Freddie.

01:18:06.264 --> 01:18:07.808
You're my best friend.

01:18:09.059 --> 01:18:10.018
Really?

01:18:12.187 --> 01:18:14.606
-'Cause I wasn't sure anymore.
-Look...

01:18:15.816 --> 01:18:17.943
there's no excuse, okay?

01:18:18.819 --> 01:18:21.530
I wasn't there for you,
and you've always been there for me.

01:18:21.613 --> 01:18:22.948
I'm sorry.

01:18:23.031 --> 01:18:24.116
Eh.

01:18:24.574 --> 01:18:27.327
I was hoping for something
a little more poetic.

01:18:28.078 --> 01:18:29.705
But that'll do.

01:18:30.789 --> 01:18:32.249
Can I come in?

01:18:33.166 --> 01:18:34.334
Yes.

01:18:42.342 --> 01:18:44.094
And I'm sorry.

01:18:44.177 --> 01:18:47.180
I was a jerk, too.

01:18:47.806 --> 01:18:51.852
I mean, you were a way bigger jerk,
but still.

01:18:56.189 --> 01:18:57.315
Friends?

01:19:01.695 --> 01:19:03.739
Uh, friends.

01:19:03.822 --> 01:19:06.658
I'm just glad to have you back!

01:19:09.661 --> 01:19:12.289
I guess now I can say I know Bob.

01:19:12.372 --> 01:19:14.833
Bob? You mean "Bob?"

01:19:14.916 --> 01:19:17.169
No, Bob's dead.

01:19:17.252 --> 01:19:19.212
-Oh!
-I'm Paco, the general manager.

01:19:19.296 --> 01:19:20.422
Oh!

01:19:20.964 --> 01:19:24.593
Okay, well, thanks again for
letting us have the adoption event here.

01:19:24.676 --> 01:19:26.803
We're happy to help. It's gonna be great.

01:19:26.887 --> 01:19:29.389
-You are literally a life saver.
-I'm a puppy saver.

01:19:29.473 --> 01:19:31.600
- Wonderful.
- Great! It's a deal!

01:19:31.683 --> 01:19:33.310
-Ciao.
-See you later, Bob!

01:19:33.393 --> 01:19:35.312
-Paco!
-"Paco." Oh, damn it, Dani.

01:20:24.444 --> 01:20:27.113
Okay, here goes nothing.

01:20:34.621 --> 01:20:37.749
Hi, I'm Dani Barnes.

01:20:38.959 --> 01:20:42.587
Most of you know me
as Alexa Medina's stalker

01:20:42.671 --> 01:20:44.923
or "The Stalker."

01:20:46.591 --> 01:20:47.801
Very original.

01:20:49.261 --> 01:20:50.512
I'm not a stalker.

01:20:51.805 --> 01:20:54.349
The truth is I'm just a...

01:20:54.432 --> 01:20:59.521
goofy, dog-loving nerd.

01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:07.821
This isn't exactly the image
of a cool kid.

01:21:07.904 --> 01:21:12.742
But the truth is I'm really okay
with this girl.

01:21:14.452 --> 01:21:16.746
And turns out my dream guy was, too.

01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:17.706
But...

01:21:18.874 --> 01:21:20.250
I messed it up.

01:21:21.376 --> 01:21:23.003
I lost someone I loved

01:21:23.086 --> 01:21:28.508
just to get likes from a bunch of people
that I don't even like!

01:21:28.592 --> 01:21:29.801
No offense.

01:21:31.636 --> 01:21:34.306
Even worse, I lost myself.

01:21:35.181 --> 01:21:36.850
But I'm gonna change all that.

01:21:36.933 --> 01:21:40.687
A wise man told me
to focus on what's important to me,

01:21:40.770 --> 01:21:42.022
and it's not...

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:43.899
all of this.

01:21:43.982 --> 01:21:45.150
It's...

01:21:46.026 --> 01:21:47.110
this little guy.

01:21:50.655 --> 01:21:51.573
And...

01:21:52.115 --> 01:21:54.826
a bunch of other little guys
like him who need homes.

01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:58.413
So if you're looking for a furry friend,

01:21:59.122 --> 01:22:02.626
come adopt a dog this Saturday from Bark,

01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:04.210
at Bob's Big Boy.

01:22:06.838 --> 01:22:08.715
Okay, that's it, I guess.

01:22:10.383 --> 01:22:12.594
Shit. How do you turn this thing off?

01:22:22.062 --> 01:22:24.773
Hmm, it's a damn shame.

01:22:24.856 --> 01:22:26.316
Got a minute, Dad?

01:22:27.817 --> 01:22:29.235
We need to talk.

01:22:29.319 --> 01:22:30.403
We already talked.

01:22:31.071 --> 01:22:33.114
No, you talked.

01:22:33.198 --> 01:22:34.658
Now you need to listen.

01:22:37.202 --> 01:22:39.788
I'll grab this, you grab that one. Okay?

01:22:39.871 --> 01:22:40.705
Okay.

01:22:41.706 --> 01:22:44.751
Hi, there. Have you ever been interested
in getting a dog?

01:22:44.834 --> 01:22:48.505
My name is Dani, and I work for Bark,
and we're gonna have an event today.

01:22:48.588 --> 01:22:50.298
It'll be great. You should come.

01:22:50.882 --> 01:22:52.425
-Looks nice.
-Yeah!

01:22:52.509 --> 01:22:54.177
Let's try it on him.

01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:55.428
Great color.

01:22:56.137 --> 01:22:57.430
Dog model.

01:23:06.690 --> 01:23:08.692
Holy shih tzu!

01:23:09.359 --> 01:23:11.569
Tyrion, we did it.

01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:13.363
Well, I did it.

01:23:13.989 --> 01:23:15.407
You just slept all day.

01:23:17.117 --> 01:23:20.620
I came over here
because I want us to be friends again.

01:23:21.955 --> 01:23:23.289
I don't know.

01:23:23.373 --> 01:23:24.749
Look, I know.

01:23:25.667 --> 01:23:28.253
-We used to be really close...
-Taylor!

01:23:29.004 --> 01:23:31.256
-Yes?
-Thanks.

01:23:32.173 --> 01:23:33.967
Nobody messes with my sister.

01:23:35.802 --> 01:23:36.886
Now get out.

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:48.940
Dani, this is quite a turn out.

01:23:49.024 --> 01:23:51.234
I gotta say.

01:23:51.317 --> 01:23:52.902
Your parents are here? Hello.

01:23:52.986 --> 01:23:54.612
-Hey, guys.
-Great to see you.

01:23:54.696 --> 01:23:55.947
Hey, Hodor.

01:23:56.031 --> 01:23:58.158
Hodor's legs are coming along.

01:23:58.241 --> 01:23:59.492
Hey, guys.

01:23:59.576 --> 01:24:02.370
I cannot believe so many people
showed up because of me.

01:24:02.454 --> 01:24:04.122
Um, they didn't.

01:24:04.873 --> 01:24:05.832
What's up?

01:24:05.915 --> 01:24:10.211
It's your boy Kid Ink telling y'all,
y'all need to go hit up my homegirl

01:24:10.295 --> 01:24:12.630
Dani's pet adoption event going on.

01:24:12.714 --> 01:24:16.801
Sorry I couldn't be there, Dani,
but I saw that dope video you posted, yo.

01:24:16.885 --> 01:24:19.220
-I'll hit you when I touch down.
-This is so cool!

01:24:19.304 --> 01:24:21.139
-What?
-That's better than my video.

01:24:21.222 --> 01:24:22.057
Of course it is.

01:24:23.016 --> 01:24:25.060
Okay, gotta go. Bye, guys.

01:24:26.227 --> 01:24:27.645
I'm gonna miss you next year.

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:29.189
Oh, my God.

01:24:29.272 --> 01:24:32.609
-Is this what I think it is?
-Yep, you earned it.

01:24:33.359 --> 01:24:34.611
Thank you.

01:24:34.778 --> 01:24:36.404
Ah, you're welcome.

01:24:38.406 --> 01:24:40.033
Hey.

01:24:41.743 --> 01:24:43.411
Is that "Six Foot Yes?"

01:24:43.495 --> 01:24:44.704
Roger.

01:24:44.788 --> 01:24:47.665
- As in "Roger that."
- Nice!

01:24:53.505 --> 01:24:54.464
Oh!

01:24:58.301 --> 01:25:00.220
Oh, my Gosh!

01:25:04.265 --> 01:25:06.059
This is amazing, Shannon.

01:25:06.142 --> 01:25:08.853
I had a little motivation.

01:25:08.937 --> 01:25:12.232
I told a girl I really like that
I'd have it ready for the Bonfire.

01:25:13.191 --> 01:25:17.070
-I can't believe you did all this.
-Right, trust me. I feel the same way.

01:25:17.612 --> 01:25:19.072
-Yeah.
-My gosh.

01:25:19.155 --> 01:25:20.490
-Right?
-Yeah!

01:25:20.573 --> 01:25:21.699
You ready to go?

01:25:21.783 --> 01:25:24.536
-Yeah! Let's go!
-Bonfire, here we come.

01:25:27.914 --> 01:25:30.083
Wow, you look nice.

01:25:33.044 --> 01:25:35.421
Don't worry, he'll be there.

01:25:36.256 --> 01:25:37.590
Thanks, T.

01:25:39.092 --> 01:25:41.177
I bet you guys are
gonna make out tonight.

01:25:41.261 --> 01:25:42.470
Get out of here!

01:25:45.473 --> 01:25:47.684
Hell, yeah. They are loving the car.

01:25:47.767 --> 01:25:49.978
Hey! What's up, guys?

01:25:52.188 --> 01:25:55.733
- Hey, park next to Vinny.
- Don't worry. Okay. Okay.

01:25:55.817 --> 01:25:56.818
Watch out.

01:26:00.822 --> 01:26:02.323
Vinny!

01:26:02.407 --> 01:26:03.700
Miguel?

01:26:04.450 --> 01:26:07.036
-It's not what it looks like.
-Come on, Vinny.

01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:09.873
It looks like you're making out
with Miguel.

01:26:09.956 --> 01:26:11.791
It's exactly what it looks like.

01:26:11.875 --> 01:26:14.335
- Huh, I guess it makes sense.
- Guess so.

01:26:14.419 --> 01:26:16.796
All right, it looks like
I owe Cameron 20 bucks.

01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:27.849
I don't know whose idea it was to give me
a microphone, if I could tell you I would.

01:26:28.433 --> 01:26:31.060
I feel myself being engulfed by the power.

01:26:31.728 --> 01:26:34.689
And if we could,
could we make the fire look nice?

01:26:34.772 --> 01:26:37.233
Could that be possible?
I'm getting creative here.

01:26:37.317 --> 01:26:39.444
We can call it Vinny and the Vinaigrettes.

01:26:39.527 --> 01:26:41.404
-Oh!
-Hey, Dani!

01:26:41.487 --> 01:26:42.363
Hey, Dani.

01:26:42.447 --> 01:26:44.699
- What up?
- Glad you could make it.

01:26:44.782 --> 01:26:47.327
Oh, my God. Did you hear that Alexa
lost her YouTube channel?

01:26:48.036 --> 01:26:49.120
-No.
-Yeah.

01:26:49.204 --> 01:26:51.623
Somebody reported
she was faking her views.

01:26:51.706 --> 01:26:54.667
Gee, I wonder who that was, Miguel.

01:26:55.251 --> 01:26:57.003
-What?
-Have you guys seen Cameron?

01:26:57.086 --> 01:26:57.921
Uh, yeah.

01:26:58.004 --> 01:27:00.089
He's by the ocean, being a pensive bitch.

01:27:00.173 --> 01:27:02.842
-Don't be a dick.
-He's over by the bonfire.

01:27:02.926 --> 01:27:04.802
I'll see you guys over there.

01:27:04.886 --> 01:27:06.221
-Yeah.
-See you there.

01:27:06.304 --> 01:27:08.514
Let's do this. Come here, bear.

01:27:09.015 --> 01:27:10.475
-Tequila?
-Tequila?

01:27:12.185 --> 01:27:13.603
Hey, you guys comin'?

01:27:13.686 --> 01:27:16.231
-Yeah, yeah.
-No. We'll catch up with you in bit.

01:27:16.898 --> 01:27:18.524
Hey, stay strong, tiger.

01:27:19.609 --> 01:27:21.027
Hey, Dani!

01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:24.113
Looks like you went through
a full-on hero's journey, girl!

01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:37.168
Hey!

01:27:37.252 --> 01:27:39.796
I am killing it right now!

01:27:39.879 --> 01:27:41.673
I can see that!

01:27:42.465 --> 01:27:44.550
You wanted a little alone time?

01:27:45.969 --> 01:27:49.097
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you about that.

01:27:51.224 --> 01:27:52.308
I'm a virgin.

01:27:52.976 --> 01:27:53.810
What?

01:27:55.228 --> 01:27:58.106
-No, sorry, it's just you kinda...
-Yeah, I know.

01:27:58.189 --> 01:28:00.900
Dingleberry started that rumor
about us hooking up in his Mustang,

01:28:00.984 --> 01:28:03.152
but I never even got in his car.

01:28:03.236 --> 01:28:05.238
Why didn't you tell people the truth?

01:28:05.321 --> 01:28:06.531
I don't know.

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:09.117
It sounds pathetic, but...

01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:11.661
after that,
a lot of guys started noticing me,

01:28:11.744 --> 01:28:15.999
so it felt good being the one
getting attention for once.

01:28:16.791 --> 01:28:18.543
I don't think you're pathetic.

01:28:18.626 --> 01:28:20.545
I've always thought you were special.

01:28:20.628 --> 01:28:22.297
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:24.507
You, you do make out though, right?

01:28:25.216 --> 01:28:26.175
Oh!

01:28:31.514 --> 01:28:32.390
Wow.

01:28:33.057 --> 01:28:34.225
Um...

01:28:34.809 --> 01:28:36.602
bonfire, right?

01:28:36.686 --> 01:28:38.604
-Yes?
-Yes. Let's go.

01:28:38.688 --> 01:28:40.023
Yes, could I get one for the road?

01:28:42.317 --> 01:28:43.818
Wow.

01:28:43.901 --> 01:28:46.988
By the way, if you are looking
for a certain someone,

01:28:47.071 --> 01:28:48.614
he's over there.

01:28:51.242 --> 01:28:52.410
Thank you.

01:28:54.662 --> 01:28:56.289
-Hey, Freddie.
-Hi.

01:28:56.372 --> 01:28:58.791
Need any background dancers?

01:29:00.376 --> 01:29:03.296
Looks like they, uh,
wanna finish that routine for you.

01:29:03.379 --> 01:29:05.423
Yah! Here we go!

01:29:07.550 --> 01:29:10.345
Valley Vista High! Whoo!

01:29:10.428 --> 01:29:12.055
Yeah!

01:29:14.724 --> 01:29:16.017
Is this seat taken?

01:29:17.268 --> 01:29:18.478
Yes, it is.

01:29:18.561 --> 01:29:20.146
I'm saving it for my date.

01:29:24.901 --> 01:29:27.236
She's beautiful, smart,

01:29:28.738 --> 01:29:32.325
funny, loves animals,

01:29:32.408 --> 01:29:33.951
especially dogs...

01:29:35.411 --> 01:29:38.373
Gives good advice
and is not the best swimmer.

01:29:39.957 --> 01:29:41.209
Have you seen her?

01:29:46.756 --> 01:29:48.591
Sounds so familiar.

01:29:49.300 --> 01:29:52.095
Did she also have bitchin' dance moves?

01:29:53.262 --> 01:29:56.182
No, they were cute, though.

01:30:04.982 --> 01:30:06.859
I'm so sorry...

01:30:07.527 --> 01:30:09.070
for everything.

01:30:10.238 --> 01:30:12.406
Especially how I acted
after the swim meet.

01:30:13.366 --> 01:30:14.325
Yeah...

01:30:15.118 --> 01:30:16.786
but if it hadn't happened,

01:30:17.412 --> 01:30:19.956
you wouldn't be looking at a future
marine-biologist-Olympian.

01:30:20.873 --> 01:30:23.126
You told your dad?

01:30:25.461 --> 01:30:28.756
Well in that case, you're welcome.

01:30:36.889 --> 01:30:37.974
I missed you.

01:30:38.808 --> 01:30:40.309
I missed you, too.

01:30:41.769 --> 01:30:43.938
I hope you know I'm still the same Dani.

01:30:45.481 --> 01:30:46.524
I know.

01:30:47.984 --> 01:30:49.569
I saw your video.

01:30:53.656 --> 01:30:57.076
For the record, you never lost me.

01:31:22.226 --> 01:31:24.270
I knew they were gonna make out!

01:31:24.353 --> 01:31:25.730
Who's making out?

01:31:25.813 --> 01:31:28.107
Give your sister some privacy.

01:31:28.191 --> 01:31:29.442
Let me see.

01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:37.617
You know how to swim, right?

01:31:37.700 --> 01:31:38.701
What?

01:31:39.452 --> 01:31:41.913
Okay, 'cause I wouldn't want
to have to save you.

01:31:41.996 --> 01:31:43.122
Come on!

01:31:43.789 --> 01:31:44.874
-Come on!
-Wow.

01:31:44.957 --> 01:31:46.292
Come on.

01:31:46.375 --> 01:31:47.501
Okay.

01:31:54.091 --> 01:31:55.218
Whoo!

01:32:17.490 --> 01:32:18.741
Mm-hmm.

01:32:33.923 --> 01:32:35.132
What?

01:32:50.648 --> 01:32:52.525
I respect you so much.

01:32:53.234 --> 01:32:55.486
I don't know why I make fun of you.

01:32:55.570 --> 01:32:57.530
You're an easy target.
I shouldn't make fun.

01:32:57.613 --> 01:32:59.657
Yes, you should.

01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:03.244
No, it's just 'cause your last
name sorta sounds like "dick."

01:33:03.327 --> 01:33:05.496
That's not a good joke to make.

01:33:05.579 --> 01:33:08.457
It doesn't sorta sound like "dick."
It is "dick."

01:33:16.465 --> 01:33:17.967
Whoo!

01:33:23.931 --> 01:33:25.182
Kimmy!

01:33:35.818 --> 01:33:37.486
One, two, three.

01:33:37.570 --> 01:33:41.340
Vista Valley High!
