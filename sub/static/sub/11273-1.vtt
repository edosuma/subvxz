00:02.800 --> 00:05.394
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:08.360 --> 00:10.430
- Carla, give me a beer.
- Right.

00:11.680 --> 00:13.989
What's the story with Sam?
Isn't he back from ltaly yet?

00:14.160 --> 00:17.152
No. Three whole days,
and we haven't heard a word.

00:17.320 --> 00:19.959
He just went there to stop Diane
and Frasier from getting married.

00:20.120 --> 00:22.031
Don't know what could
be taking him so long.

00:22.200 --> 00:24.509
Maybe Frasier's still thanking him.

00:25.200 --> 00:28.636
I wouldn't be a bit surprised if Diane
now had a "Malone" after her name.

00:29.160 --> 00:30.434
Well, could be, Cliffie.

00:30.600 --> 00:33.034
That ltaly's an awfully darn
romantic place.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.111
I almost went there myself
on my honeymoon.

00:35.280 --> 00:38.955
Had the plane reservations
and the hotel reservations. Everything.

00:39.120 --> 00:40.553
Well, what stopped you, Norm?

00:40.720 --> 00:43.712
Oh, Vera.
You know, she insisted on coming.

01:00.080 --> 01:02.389
I bet you wanna know
how it went in ltaly.

01:03.840 --> 01:07.833
No, no, not really.
How about you, Cliffie?

01:08.000 --> 01:09.956
Well, I'm gonna tell you anyway.

01:12.040 --> 01:15.476
Got off the plane and I took a cab
to the Marino estate,

01:15.640 --> 01:18.313
where I had been told
they were gonna get married.

01:18.480 --> 01:22.109
But they wouldn't let me in,
so I jumped over the fence

01:22.280 --> 01:26.159
and landed in the middle
of seven snarling rottweilers.

01:26.320 --> 01:29.153
Rottweilers. It comes from
the German word "Rott--"

01:29.320 --> 01:31.959
- Cliff, shut up.
- Yes, sir.

01:32.120 --> 01:36.398
Luckily, I outsmarted the dogs
by diving into a moat.

01:36.560 --> 01:41.554
While the police were fishing me out,
I discovered that Diane and Frasier

01:41.720 --> 01:43.756
had decided to get married
someplace else.

01:43.920 --> 01:45.956
This was right before
they threw me in jail.

01:46.760 --> 01:48.716
Jail? How'd you get out?

01:48.880 --> 01:53.192
Well, a local landowner
bailed me out.

01:53.360 --> 01:58.309
Actually, he didn't bail me out.
There's a different system over there.

01:58.480 --> 01:59.799
He purchased me.

02:02.320 --> 02:06.359
Seems... Seems his ox died
or something.

02:07.680 --> 02:09.795
I really don't wanna
talk about this anymore.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.831
I'm gonna be in my office.

02:12.280 --> 02:16.159
Oh, yeah, one more thing.
I am through with that woman forever.

02:16.320 --> 02:20.074
I will never think about, see
or mention her ever again.

02:20.240 --> 02:24.358
And if anyone even uses
the words "Diane Chambers,"

02:24.520 --> 02:27.080
I will have no other choice
but to kill that person.

02:29.640 --> 02:33.076
Wow. Poor guy.
Who is this Diane Chambers anyhow?

02:33.880 --> 02:35.711
Who said that?

02:36.520 --> 02:38.033
No!. No!. No!.

03:52.840 --> 03:54.273
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

03:55.840 --> 03:57.114
What do you say, Norm?

03:57.280 --> 04:00.078
Any cheap, tawdry thing
that'll get me a beer.

04:00.960 --> 04:03.758
- Hey, Norman.
- You seem pretty chipper today.

04:03.920 --> 04:06.673
A few notches up
from your usual abysmal.

04:06.840 --> 04:09.912
Well, thank you, Cliffie. That's because
I have a little bit of good news here.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.638
- What's that?
- You know how I've been

04:11.800 --> 04:15.110
trying to get Vera pregnant?
Congratulate me.

04:15.320 --> 04:18.392
- Hey!
- Have a cigar.

04:18.560 --> 04:21.438
Whoa. Well, I think this calls
for some champagne here.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.034
- Well, thank you, Sam.
- What sex do you want it to be?

04:24.200 --> 04:26.839
Sex? Come on, I thought you just
asked for the vintage. You know?

04:27.000 --> 04:30.356
Wait, wait. I see your mistake.
Vera's not with child.

04:30.520 --> 04:33.592
She just told me I didn't have to
try to get her pregnant anymore.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.954
Let's celebrate! Come on! Party!

04:47.000 --> 04:49.355
This is amazing.

04:50.480 --> 04:52.436
Hundreds of bottles.

04:52.600 --> 04:55.160
Red and white wine glasses.

04:55.320 --> 04:58.278
High-grade Naugahyde stool covers.

04:58.440 --> 05:00.396
And a brass rail.

05:01.480 --> 05:05.314
And a big-city bartender
with a joke at the ready.

05:06.160 --> 05:08.230
You from out of town?

05:09.560 --> 05:12.916
Okay, I'll bite.
Yeah, I'm from out of town.

05:13.280 --> 05:14.599
Can I help you?

05:15.920 --> 05:18.229
Well, that went right over my head.

05:18.960 --> 05:22.919
- Excuse me, my name's Woody Boyd.
- Woody. Hi, I'm Sam Malone.

05:23.080 --> 05:25.548
Howdy. I'm a friend of Coach's.
Is he around?

05:26.720 --> 05:29.757
I'm sorry, Woody.
I guess you hadn't heard.

05:29.920 --> 05:32.514
No, Coach passed away
a couple of months ago.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.148
But, yeah, I'd like to think
he's still around.

05:37.400 --> 05:42.554
Coach, gone. I can hardly believe it.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.752
Well, he had a lot of friends.
I don't--

05:44.920 --> 05:47.070
I don't remember him
mentioning a Woody.

05:47.240 --> 05:50.949
Well, we never met.
We were kind of like pen pals.

05:52.280 --> 05:53.998
You exchanged letters?

05:54.160 --> 05:55.798
No, pens.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.831
It was Coach's idea.

06:00.040 --> 06:02.918
Oh, well, that figures.

06:03.080 --> 06:04.513
Can I get you something
to drink here?

06:04.680 --> 06:05.954
Well, a soda pop would be good.

06:06.120 --> 06:07.553
Soda pop.
All right, all right.

06:07.720 --> 06:10.109
See, I got in the habit of writing
to the bars in the big city,

06:10.280 --> 06:12.032
in the hopes of landing a job,

06:12.200 --> 06:16.159
and once I wrote a letter to Cheers,
and Coach answered my letter.

06:16.320 --> 06:18.276
I liked him right away.

06:18.440 --> 06:21.113
Maybe it was because he was
the only one who wrote back to me.

06:22.720 --> 06:24.836
Woody, did you say you
were looking for work?

06:25.360 --> 06:28.397
Well, actually, I came to Boston
on a fact-finding tour.

06:28.560 --> 06:30.790
See, I tend bar
back home in lndiana.

06:30.960 --> 06:34.509
Well, it's not a bar exactly.
It's more like...

06:34.920 --> 06:37.434
...a pigsty with a jukebox,

06:37.600 --> 06:39.238
if we had a jukebox.

06:42.440 --> 06:44.078
Carla.

06:45.680 --> 06:48.399
I'd like you to meet Woody Boyd.
Woody, this is Carla Tortelli.

06:48.560 --> 06:50.312
- Hi, ma'am.
- Ma'am?

06:51.600 --> 06:53.750
What's that supposed to mean?

06:55.120 --> 06:57.031
I believe it's a term of respect.

06:57.200 --> 07:00.829
No wonder it sounded so weird.
Who is this guy?

07:01.000 --> 07:04.515
Well, he's a friend of Coach's,
and he's looking for work.

07:04.680 --> 07:06.352
What do you think?
You wanna give him a try?

07:06.880 --> 07:08.359
Me?

07:09.640 --> 07:12.234
Mr Malone, this is
the proudest day of my life!

07:13.520 --> 07:17.195
I'd work like a slave and I wouldn't take
anything more than minimum wage.

07:17.360 --> 07:19.828
And, of course, I'd wash your car.

07:20.360 --> 07:22.715
And if you ever need someone
to just, you know, yell at,

07:23.480 --> 07:24.833
I'm your man.

07:26.320 --> 07:30.154
I think we better keep him, Sam.
He wouldn't be safe on the streets.

07:30.520 --> 07:32.033
- Thanks, Carla.
- What the hell.

07:32.200 --> 07:34.156
Woody, come on around here
and we'll check you out.

07:34.320 --> 07:37.471
You won't regret it, Mr Malone.
I love bartending.

07:37.640 --> 07:41.030
You get behind a bar, and right away
strangers are your best friends.

07:41.200 --> 07:45.876
They call you great names, like
"buddy" and "pal" and "chief" and "ace."

07:46.040 --> 07:47.268
Here's your apron, sport.

07:47.440 --> 07:49.874
Sport! Another great one!

07:50.720 --> 07:52.995
But listen, let me make
one thing clear.

07:53.160 --> 07:55.230
One mistake, and I'm out on my butt.

07:55.560 --> 07:58.472
Hey, Cliffie, next time you try
to imitate that helicopter,

07:58.640 --> 08:01.712
I think you ought to chalk up the cues
before you stick them in your ears.

08:01.880 --> 08:05.190
You kidding, Norm? I'd look
pretty silly with chalk in my ears.

08:05.360 --> 08:08.272
Cliff, Norm, Woody Boyd. Woody's
gonna be helping us out around here.

08:08.440 --> 08:09.475
- Hey.
- Nice to meet you.

08:09.680 --> 08:11.557
- All right.
- What's your pleasure, gents?

08:11.720 --> 08:12.914
Make it anything you want.

08:13.080 --> 08:15.719
Now, where I come from,
all anyone ever drinks is beer.

08:15.880 --> 08:18.599
Beer's fine, but any monkey
can pull down a tap.

08:18.760 --> 08:21.035
Why study years
to be an ace mixologist

08:21.200 --> 08:23.191
just to serve beer
after beer after beer?

08:23.560 --> 08:25.869
So, what will it be?

08:26.080 --> 08:27.672
Beer.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.233
Same.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.309
So while it's a common belief
that the Tyrannosaurus rex

08:35.480 --> 08:37.277
was the king of the dinosaurs,

08:37.440 --> 08:40.511
you know, as a-- As indicated
by the appellative "-saurus,"

08:40.880 --> 08:47.228
the smartest of the spiny reptiles
was actually the thyropatroid.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.117
Frasier W. Crane.

08:54.280 --> 08:57.192
Oh, the man who won the hand
of Diane Chambers.

08:57.360 --> 08:59.874
Found out he had to keep
the rest of her.

09:01.880 --> 09:05.429
Hello, Carla, Norm, Cliff.
It's been a long time.

09:05.600 --> 09:09.479
Yeah, we got a lot of catching up to do.
So, what's new?

09:10.440 --> 09:14.672
- I couldn't begin to tell you.
- Okay, well, that's even better.

09:16.360 --> 09:17.952
What's your pleasure?

09:18.120 --> 09:20.190
My life is devoid of pleasure.

09:20.520 --> 09:24.149
You need a good laugh.
Are you from out of town?

09:24.840 --> 09:26.273
Just give me a whiskey, punk.

09:26.680 --> 09:29.069
Punk! Oh, that's great!

09:36.200 --> 09:37.679
Where's Malone?

09:37.840 --> 09:40.593
I mean, where's
my good friend Sam?

09:41.040 --> 09:43.349
Mr Malone's in his office.
You want me to give him a buzz?

09:43.520 --> 09:45.590
No, no, I'll surprise him.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.673
Oh, by the way, any peculiar noises
you hear coming out of that room,

09:49.840 --> 09:51.114
don't let it bother you.

09:51.280 --> 09:55.558
It's just a couple of old friends
having a little fun together.

09:55.720 --> 09:59.110
Yo. I think my joke
loosened him up a little.

10:03.640 --> 10:05.198
Hello, Sam, old buddy.

10:05.520 --> 10:09.195
Frasier. What the hell
are you doing here?

10:09.400 --> 10:12.437
- Are you alone?
- Yes, I'm alone.

10:12.800 --> 10:14.438
I didn't marry Diane.

10:15.320 --> 10:16.389
You didn't?

10:16.560 --> 10:19.279
No, I didn't.
Does that make you happy?

10:20.280 --> 10:22.919
Well, I'm happy for you.

10:24.240 --> 10:25.878
Just how'd you manage that?

10:26.040 --> 10:28.315
Well, she left me at the altar.

10:28.480 --> 10:30.391
I had just vowed to take her
for my wife.

10:30.560 --> 10:32.790
The priest asked her
if she would marry me.

10:32.960 --> 10:36.077
She looked around and asked
if he was talking to her.

10:40.280 --> 10:42.271
He nodded, and she was gone.

10:42.880 --> 10:44.393
Gee, Fras, that's tough.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.949
She just took off, huh?
No explanation or anything?

10:47.160 --> 10:49.833
Well, there was no
explanation necessary.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.638
It was you she loved all along.

10:52.600 --> 10:56.354
And it was the thought of you
that made me lose her.

10:56.520 --> 11:00.718
The story of my humiliation spread
like wildfire through the university

11:00.880 --> 11:03.792
and then to the entire
ltalian countryside.

11:04.520 --> 11:07.592
Everyone knew about it.
Everyone knew about my shame.

11:07.760 --> 11:10.149
- You must have been imagining that.
- Oh, was l?

11:10.920 --> 11:12.478
Do you know that in soccer,

11:12.760 --> 11:15.035
when a player kicks at the ball,
misses and falls down,

11:15.200 --> 11:16.918
it's now called a "Frasier"?

11:21.800 --> 11:23.791
That could be a coincidence.

11:23.960 --> 11:26.269
If he's knocked cold,
it's called a "Frasier Crane."

11:29.040 --> 11:31.600
I've lost everything, Malone.

11:32.720 --> 11:35.553
My tenure, my practice
and my Diane.

11:35.920 --> 11:38.150
My life is ruined,
and it's all your fault.

11:38.920 --> 11:43.835
Now, don't you think someone
should pay for that?

11:45.640 --> 11:49.918
If by "someone," you mean
someone in this room, I can...

11:50.880 --> 11:53.440
I can honestly answer no, I don't.

11:53.600 --> 11:54.828
Oh, come on.

11:55.440 --> 11:58.557
Oh, wait-- What are you doing?
The gun's not even loaded.

11:58.720 --> 12:00.676
- Certainly it's loaded.
- No, it isn't.

12:02.160 --> 12:05.596
Of course you know it's not, because
Frasier Crane is a harmless person.

12:05.920 --> 12:08.559
He never caused you a moment's
concern, not a moment's worry.

12:08.720 --> 12:10.870
He was never a threat to
your relationship with Diane,

12:11.040 --> 12:13.508
and he's not a threat now.
Is that it, Sam?

12:13.960 --> 12:16.793
No, it's just the little holes
there are empty.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.952
Once again,
you're ahead of me, Sam.

12:29.240 --> 12:32.437
I just hoped to see you quaking in
your boots a little bit or something,

12:32.600 --> 12:34.113
but you've cheated me even of that.

12:34.960 --> 12:39.829
Boy. Boy, you're really bent
out of shape over this, aren't you?

12:40.000 --> 12:45.870
Just out of totally idle curiosity,
whatever did happen to Diane?

12:46.440 --> 12:50.069
Well, I was recently informed
by my mentor, Dr Bennett Ludlow,

12:50.240 --> 12:52.629
whose care I'm now under,
incidentally.

12:54.280 --> 12:56.475
And believe me,
he's doing a heck of a job.

12:57.680 --> 13:01.116
He told me that she's at
St. Anselm's Abbey,

13:01.480 --> 13:06.600
an hour outside of Boston,
with the Sisters of the Divine Severity.

13:08.880 --> 13:11.474
Oh, whoa, whoa, wait.
You can't be a nun if you've already--

13:11.640 --> 13:14.359
Oh, she's not becoming a nun,
you idiot!

13:14.520 --> 13:18.274
She's working there. She's cleaning,
serving meals, wearing sackcloth,

13:18.440 --> 13:20.351
- that sort of thing.
- I'll be damned.

13:20.520 --> 13:22.556
You see, after she left me,

13:22.720 --> 13:26.508
Diane embarked upon
a spree of decadence in ltaly.

13:27.120 --> 13:30.954
I'd hear stories about dancing
on tables in cafés,

13:31.760 --> 13:34.069
swimming in public fountains,

13:34.240 --> 13:37.789
cavorting with counts
and soccer players.

13:39.880 --> 13:42.348
Well, now she's doing penance
for la dolce vita.

13:42.520 --> 13:46.195
She's seeking peace.
I hope she's found it.

13:47.520 --> 13:50.159
Diane, dancing on tabletops?

13:50.320 --> 13:53.676
You mean my--? Your--? Our--?
The Diane?

13:54.040 --> 13:56.076
Yes, all of them.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.876
But now listen, Sam,

13:59.040 --> 14:00.792
- you won't go and see her will you?
- No!

14:00.960 --> 14:02.837
I mean, it would be
disaster for everyone.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.833
No, no.
Believe me, I wouldn't do that.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.638
No, I'm over her.

14:07.800 --> 14:09.995
You know, and if you know
what's good for you,

14:10.160 --> 14:12.196
I think you should forget
about her too.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.475
Oh, I'll forget about her.

14:15.640 --> 14:17.676
I'll forget about her
when the moon turns to ashes

14:17.840 --> 14:19.592
and the birds sing nevermore.

14:19.760 --> 14:21.318
There you go.

14:24.360 --> 14:26.430
Well, I'm sorry about
the histrionics, Sam.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.431
- Oh, no, don't.
- You know, it's funny,

14:28.600 --> 14:32.673
even through all this,
I still think of you as my goombah.

14:33.880 --> 14:36.394
Well, it's best that I get going.

14:36.560 --> 14:38.596
But let's do the lunch thing
sometime.

14:39.600 --> 14:42.114
I'd like that. Yeah. Take care.

14:42.680 --> 14:44.033
You won't go see her?

14:45.040 --> 14:46.553
No way. No.

15:41.480 --> 15:43.436
- Hi, Diane.
- Hi, Sam.

15:47.560 --> 15:49.471
Calm-- Calm down, here.

15:49.640 --> 15:51.995
I just popped in to say howdy.

15:52.480 --> 15:54.277
Are you okay?

15:59.200 --> 16:01.555
What the hell--? Heck...

16:04.240 --> 16:05.434
...are you doing here?

16:06.640 --> 16:10.599
I bumped into Frasier, and he told me
that you checked into a convent,

16:10.760 --> 16:13.433
and I was afraid
you got all squirrelly again.

16:16.040 --> 16:18.474
Thank you for your
carefully worded concern,

16:18.640 --> 16:21.518
- Well, now, you know--
- but I assure you, I am fine.

16:25.120 --> 16:29.159
Oh, Sam, I was so sorry
to hear about the Coach.

16:29.480 --> 16:31.118
Yeah, I know, I know.

16:31.960 --> 16:34.474
Not a day goes by when
I don't miss him terribly.

16:34.640 --> 16:36.119
Me too.

16:36.560 --> 16:38.039
You know what helps me, though,

16:38.200 --> 16:41.078
is I always remember what
he used to say about the afterlife,

16:41.240 --> 16:43.470
"l hope there are not a lot of stairs."

16:45.000 --> 16:47.434
- It's wise in its way.
- Yeah.

16:47.600 --> 16:50.558
Sam, you're really gonna have
to leave. It's wrong for you to be here.

16:51.120 --> 16:54.157
All right, but there's something
I gotta say first, though.

16:54.320 --> 16:56.788
All right, fine. But if they find you,
it's your problem.

16:56.960 --> 16:58.837
- All right.
- I'm not covering for you.

16:59.920 --> 17:01.876
Sister Catherine!

17:02.120 --> 17:04.111
Have you met the rice inspector?

17:05.440 --> 17:07.589
The rice inspector sent
by the archdiocese

17:07.760 --> 17:10.637
to inspect the rice,
which is what they do.

17:11.560 --> 17:13.755
Ah, yes, very good.

17:15.400 --> 17:18.710
Sam, what is it? Tell me what you
have to say and then leave, please.

17:18.880 --> 17:21.598
Listen, I want you
to come back to Cheers.

17:21.760 --> 17:24.069
I don't think you belong here, Diane.

17:25.400 --> 17:28.597
No, Sam, I do belong here.

17:28.760 --> 17:31.911
Although I'm not of their order,
the sisters took me in,

17:32.080 --> 17:35.516
and working here among them

17:35.680 --> 17:38.672
has helped me find the peace
that had so eluded me.

17:39.200 --> 17:41.668
Besides, if I came back to Cheers,
it would lead

17:41.840 --> 17:44.229
to nothing but terrible problems
between you and me.

17:44.400 --> 17:46.231
No, no, it's not like that anymore.

17:46.400 --> 17:49.995
Because all I feel for you
is the concern of a friend.

17:50.160 --> 17:53.835
The same way I would for, say,
Norm or a dog.

17:57.920 --> 17:59.638
You say that,

17:59.800 --> 18:04.510
but you know our passions
always overcome our intentions.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.912
We say it's over, and yet we still
end up in each other's arms,

18:08.360 --> 18:10.555
hugging, then kissing,

18:11.000 --> 18:13.070
perhaps lightly at first...

18:14.720 --> 18:17.154
...but then with open mouths...

18:17.720 --> 18:20.075
...hungry, probing tongues...

18:23.040 --> 18:24.837
Go on, please.

18:29.440 --> 18:32.989
I appreciate the offer, Sam,
but I'm needed here,

18:33.160 --> 18:39.190
and I need to be here
and I need to be needed here.

18:42.040 --> 18:45.589
- You really mean this, don't you?
- Yes, I do.

18:48.080 --> 18:51.038
Well, I guess that's what matters.

18:52.720 --> 18:54.756
I guess I better be going.

18:54.920 --> 18:56.592
I recognised one of the ladies,

18:56.760 --> 19:00.070
and I think that I'm the reason
why she's here in the first place.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.350
I'm glad I got to see you.

19:04.800 --> 19:06.791
Yeah, I'm glad I came.

19:08.560 --> 19:10.118
Turned out kind of nice, huh?

19:10.280 --> 19:11.713
Yes, it was good.

19:11.880 --> 19:14.110
I'm glad we had a chance
to end it this way.

19:14.280 --> 19:16.714
Cleanly, spiritually.

19:16.880 --> 19:21.795
Free of rancour and sexual tens--
Tens-- Tension.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.473
Whatever.

19:24.480 --> 19:27.074
- Well, this is where it ends, huh?
- Yeah.

19:27.960 --> 19:29.359
Goodbye.

19:30.160 --> 19:31.229
Goodbye.

19:35.400 --> 19:38.278
I swore I'd never tell you this ever,

19:38.440 --> 19:42.115
but I guess maybe because we're
never gonna see each other again...

19:42.280 --> 19:46.353
You know, you always used to accuse
me of being an unromantic slob,

19:46.840 --> 19:48.910
but you wanna know the truth?
When you called me

19:49.080 --> 19:51.150
to tell me that you
were marrying Frasier,

19:51.320 --> 19:54.517
I flew on a plane to ltaly
to stop the wedding.

19:54.680 --> 19:57.069
I guess I thought I was
in love with you

19:57.240 --> 20:00.994
and that you and l
should be married.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.031
Not that I feel that way now.

20:04.600 --> 20:07.160
But, well, I just thought
you ought to know that.

20:08.240 --> 20:10.629
Have a good life. Bye.

20:15.640 --> 20:16.868
Good evening.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.712
Good-- Good evening, Sister Marie.

20:21.880 --> 20:24.519
I heard that the rice inspector
was here.

20:26.560 --> 20:30.712
He wasn't the rice inspector.
He was a man from my past.

20:30.880 --> 20:33.713
Say no more.
There's no need to explain.

20:33.880 --> 20:37.350
- I feel I must.
- I knew you would.

20:40.080 --> 20:45.518
He wanted me to return to the outside,
to the life I used to know.

20:46.320 --> 20:50.359
By the way, I hope you like this.
I got a little creative tonight.

20:50.520 --> 20:53.637
- Oh, yet again.
- Taste it.

20:54.440 --> 20:58.274
At any rate, I told him that
I wasn't going to leave,

20:58.440 --> 21:00.590
that I'm needed too much here.

21:01.320 --> 21:06.189
Do you think I am, Sister?
I mean, I feel that I'm ready now

21:06.360 --> 21:11.309
to leave, to get on with my life,
but I feel so safe here.

21:11.480 --> 21:12.708
What do you think?

21:16.360 --> 21:19.591
Put your faith in God.

21:20.600 --> 21:22.750
I know I'm going to.

21:30.640 --> 21:32.870
Time to do the floors.

21:33.920 --> 21:37.629
These ladies can be so messy.

21:38.520 --> 21:41.557
Rice everywhere.

21:54.960 --> 21:58.191
I haven't done this
since I was a child...

21:59.480 --> 22:01.311
...but when in Rome...

22:04.720 --> 22:09.396
Now, I know there are far greater
problems in the world than mine,

22:09.960 --> 22:14.590
but I'm feeling as though
I'm at a crossroads.

22:15.120 --> 22:20.148
And I was wondering
if you could give me a little sign...

22:21.040 --> 22:25.079
...to tell me what to do.

22:34.720 --> 22:37.393
Excuse me. Hi.

22:37.960 --> 22:41.077
You wouldn't know where a men's
room was around here, would you?

22:44.320 --> 22:47.118
Sam, would you put a men's room
in a convent?

22:47.520 --> 22:49.715
Right now I would, yes.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.873
Just any sign. Something--

22:58.760 --> 23:00.876
Oh! Oh!

23:01.960 --> 23:04.030
Well...

23:04.600 --> 23:07.433
...it's not the parting of the Red Sea.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.478
That's nitpicking.
