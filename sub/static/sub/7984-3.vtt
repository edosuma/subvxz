turn me into my father.

31:22.820 --> 31:25.985
Then I shall hold on to these
until our paths cross again.

31:26.808 --> 31:28.041
(scoffs)

31:29.214 --> 31:30.731
It's been interesting.

31:34.635 --> 31:36.001
Actually, it hasn't.

31:36.257 --> 31:38.607
It's been a total nightmare
from start to finish.

31:40.961 --> 31:42.446
This is where my journey ends.

31:52.597 --> 31:53.922
Wil, wait!

31:55.603 --> 31:56.547
You can't leave Amberle.

31:56.572 --> 31:57.805
Did Allanon put you up to this?

31:57.892 --> 31:59.055
Don't worry, she'll be fine.

31:59.080 --> 32:00.336
No, she won't!

32:00.736 --> 32:03.239
Bandon, I'm done here, okay?

32:03.786 --> 32:05.754
She's home, safe and sound.

32:05.779 --> 32:07.751
I did what I said I'd
do and now I'm done.

32:07.776 --> 32:09.826
I can't let you do that.

32:13.571 --> 32:16.869
If you don't go with Amberle to Safehold,
something terrible will happen.

32:19.005 --> 32:20.738
How do you know about Safehold?

32:22.038 --> 32:23.766
Please... Wil...

32:25.364 --> 32:26.847
you have to trust me.

♪♪

33:07.206 --> 33:08.276
(pounds staff on floor)

33:08.301 --> 33:12.340
The Elvin Council is called to
discuss the crisis of the Ellcrys.

33:13.178 --> 33:14.227
Allanon.

33:16.368 --> 33:18.555
The Ellcrys is dying.

33:19.175 --> 33:21.956
As it sheds its leaves,
a Demon army forms,

33:21.981 --> 33:24.446
preparing to unleash its
evil upon our world.

33:24.945 --> 33:26.278
(council members muttering)

33:28.684 --> 33:31.110
Let me assure you,
these Demons are real.

33:32.114 --> 33:37.180
Not only did they kill the
Chosen but also my aunt, Pyria.

33:48.869 --> 33:50.727
The Ellcrys will bear a seed.

33:51.490 --> 33:54.532
That seed must be carried
by one of the Chosen

33:55.017 --> 33:58.063
to a place called Safehold.

33:59.333 --> 34:02.126
There it will be immersed
in the Bloodfire.

34:03.028 --> 34:05.641
Only then can it be returned

34:06.414 --> 34:08.774
and the Ellcrys can be reborn.

34:10.598 --> 34:13.360
As the only remaining
member of the Chosen,

34:14.228 --> 34:17.665
the burden of this quest
falls upon your princess...

34:18.851 --> 34:19.583
Amberle.

34:20.367 --> 34:23.018
(council members muttering)

34:30.608 --> 34:32.951
My father taught me that
magic died years ago.

34:34.292 --> 34:35.275
I was wrong.

34:37.596 --> 34:40.929
Yet now he asks us to
believe in fairy tales.

34:41.906 --> 34:44.928
For all we know, this is nothing
but a plot by the other Races

34:44.992 --> 34:46.411
to bring us to our knees.

34:46.437 --> 34:48.708
The Dagda Mor is the
only one plotting here.

34:49.263 --> 34:50.779
Demons are your enemies.

34:52.299 --> 34:54.467
And she is your only hope.

34:55.476 --> 34:58.724
We cannot put the fate of the
Four Lands and the Elvin people

34:58.749 --> 35:01.092
in the hands of this
Druid and my niece,

35:01.670 --> 35:02.991
whom I love dearly,

35:04.415 --> 35:07.194
but who has run away from
her duties once already.

35:08.391 --> 35:09.912
Amberle didn't run away.

35:11.130 --> 35:12.944
She was trying to protect you.

35:13.505 --> 35:15.444
Commander Tilton, escort him out now.

35:15.940 --> 35:18.678
By Elvin law, you are not to lay a hand

35:18.703 --> 35:20.225
upon a member of the royal family.

35:20.428 --> 35:23.873
I guarantee that this half-breed
is not a member of this family.

35:24.419 --> 35:25.869
No, he is not.

35:28.661 --> 35:32.201
He is the last son of Shannara.

35:41.115 --> 35:42.256
Let him speak!

35:43.412 --> 35:44.326
(Wil) Thank you.

35:47.147 --> 35:51.381
Look, I know what you're all thinking.

35:51.597 --> 35:54.270
That the things you're hearing
are too incredible to be true.

35:55.326 --> 35:58.350
But magic and demons are real.

35:58.939 --> 36:01.155
I have seen them with my own eyes.

36:01.987 --> 36:04.271
Quite frankly, all I
want to do is run away.

36:05.894 --> 36:07.045
Then I met Amberle.

36:08.260 --> 36:09.358
She might have been frightened,

36:09.964 --> 36:12.092
but she's also incredibly brave.

36:12.364 --> 36:14.014
She didn't have to come back,

36:14.822 --> 36:15.733
but she did,

36:16.863 --> 36:19.631
for all of you, the people she loves.

36:20.347 --> 36:22.316
And if I had to put my faith in anyone

36:22.341 --> 36:24.558
to save the Four Lands,
it would be her.

36:34.116 --> 36:35.048
Hmm...

36:35.921 --> 36:37.420
Don't even say it.

36:38.246 --> 36:39.678
I think these belong to you.

36:46.795 --> 36:47.920
(Eventine) Now...

36:49.488 --> 36:50.037
(thumps staff)

36:50.573 --> 36:53.834
I put the question to you,
esteemed members of the Council.

36:54.981 --> 36:57.545
Will you allow Amberle to
return to the Sanctuary

36:58.825 --> 37:00.725
and fulfill her sacred duty?

37:03.520 --> 37:05.871

37:08.008 --> 37:09.308
(Eventine) Amberle Elessedil,

37:10.470 --> 37:12.135
you turned your back on the Chosen

37:12.160 --> 37:13.951
and your duties to the Ellcrys.

37:14.589 --> 37:15.154
I did.

37:16.051 --> 37:19.717
And now you wish to carry
its seed to the Bloodfire.

37:20.547 --> 37:21.079
I do.

37:22.366 --> 37:23.993
According to the Codex,

37:24.157 --> 37:26.081
the Ellcrys must be satisfied

37:26.106 --> 37:28.280
of your commitment to this quest.

37:29.443 --> 37:32.858
If you pass the test, it
will give you the seed.

37:35.248 --> 37:36.311
If you fail...

37:37.498 --> 37:38.373
you will die.

37:44.225 --> 37:47.155
Are you willing to enter the tree?

37:53.234 --> 37:54.545
I am.

38:09.530 --> 38:11.123
I wish I could go in there with you.

38:11.999 --> 38:12.772
I know.

38:15.365 --> 38:16.944
Thanks for coming back.

38:18.094 --> 38:19.780
I figured Allanon would get lonely.

38:20.658 --> 38:23.709
And it turns out I enjoy staring death
in the face at least once a day.
