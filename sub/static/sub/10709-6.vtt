00:12.106 --> 00:15.315
Mari. Awaken, my child.

00:15.415 --> 00:19.501
It is not yet time for you,
She-Spirit.

00:20.167 --> 00:22.275
You must stop the pretender.

00:22.375 --> 00:24.614
The darkness has infected her.

00:25.220 --> 00:28.189
That is why your mother
left this land.

00:28.289 --> 00:30.486
She knew
she had to put as much distance

00:30.586 --> 00:33.801
between your sister and the totem,
and you.

00:35.724 --> 00:37.824
Embrace your true calling.

00:37.924 --> 00:41.515
We will stand with you
as long as you stand with us.

00:41.615 --> 00:44.185
Do not fear the power in you.

00:44.423 --> 00:46.596
Embrace your true calling.

00:46.797 --> 00:50.971
We will stand with you
as long as you stand with us.

00:51.071 --> 00:53.053
Mari!

00:57.948 --> 01:00.337
I will stand with you!

01:07.227 --> 01:08.338
Hey!

01:08.738 --> 01:10.969
I know we just met,
but I'm pretty sure

01:11.071 --> 01:13.645
you're the history of mental illness
in the family.

01:13.745 --> 01:16.268
The planes did not claim you.
Impressive.

01:16.368 --> 01:19.994
I've heard about sisters always
stealing the younger ones' stuff.

01:20.094 --> 01:21.898
I've stolen nothing.

01:21.998 --> 01:25.568
I've merely reclaimed
what was always mine by right.

01:25.668 --> 01:27.483
The totem told me different.

01:27.583 --> 01:29.248
According to the animal spirits,

01:29.349 --> 01:32.039
mum wanted to get as far
away from you as possible.

01:32.139 --> 01:35.483
I must say... I'm disappointed.

01:35.583 --> 01:37.697
What form should I use to kill you?

01:46.973 --> 01:48.932
You think this changes anything?

01:49.032 --> 01:51.039
I am the She-Spirit now!

01:51.140 --> 01:54.300
- Me!
- I will not be afraid.

01:54.480 --> 01:58.319
I will embrace my destiny.
I will cling fast to my ancestors.

02:11.382 --> 02:14.806
You think a mere stick can harm me?

02:17.488 --> 02:19.476
Looks like it worked just fine.

02:29.609 --> 02:32.164
No.
What've you done?

02:32.264 --> 02:34.188
Whatever's in that poison
works a lot faster

02:34.288 --> 02:36.619
when exposed directly
to the bloodstream.

02:36.719 --> 02:38.371
But that's just a guess!

02:42.144 --> 02:45.650
This cannot be happening.
The totem is mine!

02:45.750 --> 02:47.596
- It's mine.
- No!

02:47.696 --> 02:51.303
The totem is ours.
Our family's.

02:52.004 --> 02:54.246
This... isn't... over...

02:54.346 --> 02:56.914
I gotta be honest.
It looks pretty over.

03:16.270 --> 03:17.953
My whole life...

03:18.053 --> 03:20.096
I thought if I knew where I came from,

03:20.701 --> 03:22.613
I'd learn where I was going,

03:22.714 --> 03:24.647
what my purpose in life is.

03:26.554 --> 03:28.251
Turns out...

03:28.351 --> 03:29.852
I was right.

03:29.952 --> 03:32.588
So now, you're giving up
fashion design to become...

03:32.607 --> 03:35.317
- what? A hero?
- I'm not giving up my art.

03:35.417 --> 03:38.481
The truth is... that jerk
I stabbed in the hand...

03:38.581 --> 03:39.882
he was right.

03:39.982 --> 03:42.479
My work lacked identity,
because I didn't have it.

03:42.879 --> 03:44.678
And now I do.

03:44.778 --> 03:48.178
So, fashion design by day
and takin' on muggers at night?

03:48.278 --> 03:51.012
The totem is supposed to help me
protect my village.

03:51.112 --> 03:54.541
Detroit is my village.
It's my home.

03:54.641 --> 03:56.157
You never said that before.

03:56.257 --> 03:58.511
I haven't said a lot of things before.

03:58.612 --> 04:01.058
Things I should have said
a long time ago.

04:01.924 --> 04:04.021
I love you, dad.

04:05.087 --> 04:07.188
I love you too.

04:08.742 --> 04:12.707
Dad... can you...
give me a minute?

04:12.807 --> 04:14.889
I thought I told you
if you came back here,

04:14.989 --> 04:18.380
- I'd disembowel you.
- We took that to mean you'd try.

04:18.480 --> 04:20.795
I know he seems cold and off-putting,

04:20.894 --> 04:22.596
but once you get to know him...

04:22.696 --> 04:25.805
Well, then he is definitely
cold and off-putting.

04:25.905 --> 04:29.558
My point is...
it was foolish of you to think

04:29.559 --> 04:31.981
we'd stay away just
because you told us to.

04:32.282 --> 04:35.606
Almost as foolish as you taking on
Detroit's criminal element

04:35.806 --> 04:37.782
...in a brown leotard.

04:37.882 --> 04:39.852
And what's wrong with brown?

04:41.521 --> 04:44.974
I mean...
you don't have any training.

04:45.074 --> 04:48.001
Look, give me a chance to figure
things on my own for a while.

04:48.101 --> 04:49.202
All right?

04:50.389 --> 04:53.575
Sounds fair.
Good luck, Mari.

04:53.675 --> 04:55.883
If you're ever in a bind,
you know who to call.

04:55.983 --> 04:59.388
Hey, I thought I was supposed
to have a cool name, or something.

04:59.489 --> 05:04.282
- You think the "Arrow" is cool?
- Keep talking, Flash.

05:04.382 --> 05:07.368
If it helps, Cisco's
been calling you "Vixen".

05:07.468 --> 05:10.850
Not that "Cisco" is a name
of anyone affiliated with me.

05:10.950 --> 05:13.823
He's not. I mean, if there
was a Cisco affiliated with me.

05:13.923 --> 05:14.842
Which there isn't.

05:14.942 --> 05:17.274
Were you and Felicity
separated at birth?

05:17.374 --> 05:20.847
I hope not. 'Cause if we had been,
that kiss would be weird.

05:20.948 --> 05:23.071
- You kissed her?
- You know what? I gotta run.

05:25.274 --> 05:28.230
- This life isn't easy.
- I figure,

05:28.330 --> 05:29.650
but I can handle it.

05:29.750 --> 05:33.041
- You sound pretty sure.
- I know who I am.

05:41.920 --> 05:43.857
I'm Vixen.
