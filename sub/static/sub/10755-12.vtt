00:18.011 --> 00:21.630
- Morning.
- Morning.

00:21.807 --> 00:25.592
Morning?
Oh, my God, Joe, get up!

00:25.771 --> 00:28.105
You were supposed to be out hours ago!

00:28.330 --> 00:31.931
You promised me that after we did
the deed you'd be on your way.

00:33.394 --> 00:35.565
- l was.
- Get dressed.

00:35.740 --> 00:40.119
We've got to get you out of here
before Dr Crane gets up.

00:40.288 --> 00:43.907
Oh, no. l smell coffee!
They're already up!

00:44.085 --> 00:46.540
l'll just lay low until the two of them...

00:46.712 --> 00:49.714
My God, it's 9:00!
l'm late for work!

00:49.883 --> 00:53.799
- l'll get rid of them.
- Where's my underwear?

00:55.495 --> 00:58.092
Eddie, get back here!

01:01.772 --> 01:04.265
- (Frasier) Good morning.
- Maybe for you.

01:04.528 --> 01:07.524
l couldn't button these pants.

01:07.697 --> 01:11.481
That stupid dryer
shrunk another pair on me.

01:15.580 --> 01:20.413
Have you ever considered
stepping on the old bathroom scale?

01:20.588 --> 01:24.918
What's the point? That thing's been
ten pounds off for weeks.

01:31.267 --> 01:33.391
Daphne?

01:33.562 --> 01:36.267
Good morning. Sorry l overslept.

01:36.681 --> 01:39.122
Time we all got our day started.

01:39.244 --> 01:40.774
l'll just clear these dishes away.

01:40.815 --> 01:44.778
- l wasn't finished yet.
- Whoops. Sorry about that.

01:45.824 --> 01:48.026
l wasn't finished with that toast either.

01:48.083 --> 01:50.965
You can't play squash on a full stomach.

01:50.993 --> 01:56.459
Yes. Many matches have been marred
by the heartbreak of toast cramps.

01:57.108 --> 01:59.254
Don't you have a doctor's appointment?

01:59.291 --> 02:02.297
Not yet.
Why are you giving us the bum's rush?

02:02.406 --> 02:06.251
Bum's rush!
l love the American vernacular.

02:06.307 --> 02:09.476
So cute. So quaint. So long.

02:10.899 --> 02:13.936
Gotta get my wallet.
These damn pants!

02:14.569 --> 02:19.403
You spend 1 5 on a good pair of pants,
you expect them to be shrink-resistant.

02:19.576 --> 02:24.452
When you spend that kind of money
you're paying for the designer name.

02:25.541 --> 02:29.077
- l've gotta go. l'm so late.
- Oh, hurry!

02:29.228 --> 02:31.628
- l'll call you later.
- OK. Bye.

02:37.319 --> 02:40.764
- Hello, Joe.
- Hi, Dr Crane.

02:40.935 --> 02:43.972
l just came by to give Daphne a kiss.

02:48.695 --> 02:51.899
And drop off these shoes.

02:52.928 --> 02:55.659
- Here.
- Thank you.

02:55.828 --> 03:00.906
Can anyone make this moment
a bit more awkward than it already is?

03:10.721 --> 03:12.928
Thank you, Eddie.

03:18.515 --> 03:20.521
(Frasier) Thank you very much.

03:21.565 --> 03:25.408
- lsn't that Dirk and Gabby Bindercott?
- Friends of yours?

03:25.446 --> 03:28.818
Filthy rich. Timber money.
lt does grow on trees!

03:28.994 --> 03:31.450
Dirk! Gabby!

03:31.622 --> 03:34.030
Oh, Dirk!

03:34.916 --> 03:38.593
- Hello, Niles.
- Dirk Bindercott, Dr Frasier Crane.

03:38.715 --> 03:41.212
l've heard your program.

03:41.767 --> 03:44.836
Well...l've seen your wife.

03:46.515 --> 03:50.728
So Niles, l suppose
l'll see you at the benefit on Sunday.

03:50.782 --> 03:53.019
l know Maris is coming.

03:53.190 --> 03:58.778
Yes, Sunday. Which benefit is Sunday?
l have so many benefits...on Sunday.

03:58.947 --> 04:01.948
The Hoedown for the Homeless.
You were invited?

04:02.117 --> 04:04.905
The Hoedown? Yippee-yai-yes!

04:06.790 --> 04:09.526
- That must be Gabby.
- Certainly sounds like her.

04:09.629 --> 04:13.463
- See you Sunday.
- Yes. Till Sunday.

04:17.959 --> 04:20.803
- l wasn't invited.
- Niles, it's one party.

04:20.974 --> 04:24.639
Off the A-list for one party,
off for all of them.

04:24.721 --> 04:27.184
l'll be relegated to B-list events.

04:27.222 --> 04:30.100
Grubby theatre companies
and last year's diseases.

04:31.578 --> 04:38.077
When two people separate, their friends
choose one spouse over the other.

04:38.245 --> 04:42.741
They chose Maris because she's
better connected and has more money.

04:43.514 --> 04:47.247
Exactly which part of that
was meant to ease my pain?

04:47.423 --> 04:51.421
- You're overreacting.
- Oh, wait. l know what happened.

04:51.594 --> 04:55.592
My invitation just got lost in the mail.
lt's not so far-fetched.

04:55.766 --> 05:00.809
lt could have been mis-sorted or it could
have been stolen by my mail carrier.

05:00.835 --> 05:04.315
Hoedowns are catnip to postal workers.

05:05.697 --> 05:09.652
l'd ask you to explain that,
but then you would.

05:10.384 --> 05:12.575
l'm going to check with the post office.

05:12.829 --> 05:15.622
l heard about a man who bought a piano

05:15.772 --> 05:19.909
and he found
a 40-year-old unmailed letter in it.

05:19.984 --> 05:24.465
We should contact Ferrante and
Teicher. See if they have your invitation.

05:24.634 --> 05:26.409
Poke fun now.

05:26.503 --> 05:30.808
Who'll feel foolish when l'm sipping
champagne atop a mechanical bull?

05:33.270 --> 05:34.773
Cappuccino, please.

05:34.839 --> 05:38.192
Roz, l want to get
your take on something.

05:38.360 --> 05:40.601
- What?
- Well...

05:41.905 --> 05:46.533
Daphne has sex in my apartment
and it leaves me in an awkward position.

05:46.703 --> 05:50.654
Doing what? Bending over
to look through the keyhole?

05:50.833 --> 05:53.325
What is the big deal?

05:53.503 --> 05:57.357
Say l'm sitting there listening to music,
reading a book...

05:58.080 --> 06:01.880
and Daphne and Joe are back there...

06:02.055 --> 06:05.555
- So?
- lt just makes me uncomfortable.

06:06.890 --> 06:10.977
l'll ask Daphne not to sleep
with Joe in the house. ls that too...

06:11.150 --> 06:13.641
Amish?

06:14.345 --> 06:16.162
l was going to say selfish.

06:16.191 --> 06:20.903
Oh, let's see. ''Please Daphne,
don't have sex. lt disturbs my reading.''

06:20.985 --> 06:23.088
No, that's not too selfish.

06:23.276 --> 06:25.619
A man should be comfortable at home.

06:25.966 --> 06:31.453
How can l relax when every giggle,
every noise makes me...you know...

06:31.564 --> 06:34.837
- Picture it?
- Of course not!

06:34.886 --> 06:38.216
Don't be ridiculous. The very idea!

06:38.391 --> 06:42.390
- You're picturing it right now, aren't you?
- You made me!

06:48.034 --> 06:52.276
- (Martin) Hey, Fras.
- Hi, Dad. ls Daphne in?

06:52.449 --> 06:56.318
Yeah, and you should pretend
that nothing's happened.

06:56.497 --> 06:59.292
Denial. The sort of advice l'd expect

06:59.339 --> 07:03.587
from a man whose driver's license
still lists his hair colour as brown.

07:05.424 --> 07:08.591
lt was until you came back to town.

07:15.098 --> 07:19.892
Daphne. l think we need to discuss
what happened this morning.

07:20.067 --> 07:23.401
lt's been bothering me all day.
lt was my fault.

07:23.571 --> 07:27.570
No, l share the blame.
We never discussed the house rules,

07:27.634 --> 07:31.112
especially when it comes to...
you know...

07:31.205 --> 07:34.670
l apologise
for any embarrassment l caused.

07:34.810 --> 07:40.081
We can't go to Joe's - he's still building
his house and he sleeps at a friend's.

07:40.258 --> 07:42.927
But it will never happen again.

07:43.541 --> 07:46.546
Then our business is concluded.
Meeting adjourned.

07:46.720 --> 07:51.527
Yes. Next time Joe spends the night,
l'll notify you well in advance.

08:02.786 --> 08:07.496
Daphne, l was just reviewing
the minutes of our last meeting.

08:09.711 --> 08:11.917
There seems to be some confusion.

08:12.088 --> 08:15.044
My quibble is not
with the lack of notification.

08:15.217 --> 08:20.924
l am just not comfortable with you and
Joe sleeping together under my roof.

08:21.100 --> 08:26.095
l see. l'm sorry about that,
but it is my room, isn't it?

08:26.272 --> 08:28.515
Yes and l want you to feel comfortable.

08:28.692 --> 08:34.068
lt's more important for you to feel
comfortable because it is your roof.

08:35.993 --> 08:38.198
- Thanks for understanding.
- Not at all.

08:38.371 --> 08:40.871
l'm going away for the weekend,

08:40.937 --> 08:45.413
but first thing Monday
l'll start looking for my own place.

08:54.375 --> 08:56.597
Guess who.

08:57.978 --> 09:00.988
Daphne...
l don't want you entertaining here

09:01.063 --> 09:03.724
but l also don't want you to move out.

09:03.902 --> 09:06.633
So you want me to stay
but not have a personal life?

09:07.384 --> 09:12.109
That works out fine. l'll spend
all day waiting on you and your father,

09:12.212 --> 09:16.264
then retire to my room
and wait for the morning.

09:16.291 --> 09:20.871
lf my whimpering gets too loud,
you can just have me fixed like Eddie.

09:25.887 --> 09:29.854
That is not what l meant.
This is difficult for both of us, Daphne.

09:29.891 --> 09:34.198
l have to express my feelings.
l also don't want to lose you.

09:34.413 --> 09:38.308
- You're important to us.
- That's why my solution is best.

09:38.486 --> 09:42.053
l'll be here during the day
to take care of your father,

09:42.156 --> 09:45.573
but nights and weekends l'll go home.

09:45.901 --> 09:50.905
And you can turn this room back into
the beautiful study you used to have.

09:51.084 --> 09:53.623
What other choice do we have?

09:53.796 --> 09:57.247
lt'll be a period of adjustment
for all of us...

09:57.425 --> 10:03.595
l know how much you care about me
and consider me part of the family but...

10:03.766 --> 10:06.388
You're picturing your study, aren't you?

10:06.562 --> 10:08.685
You made me!

10:13.611 --> 10:17.064
(Martin) # She's such a groovy lady #

10:17.241 --> 10:20.112
- Morning, Dad.
- Oh, morning.

10:20.286 --> 10:23.621
- Seen the phone?
- l left it in my room again.

10:23.791 --> 10:25.689
You want a breakfast burrito?

10:25.829 --> 10:27.228
l'll passo!

10:28.440 --> 10:29.745
Suit yourself.

10:38.642 --> 10:41.727
What happened
to the silk pyjamas l bought you?

10:41.829 --> 10:44.569
They're too la-di-da for me.

10:44.719 --> 10:47.424
Besides, they shrank.

10:50.359 --> 10:54.444
There go my Tater Tots.
You want a pile?

10:55.247 --> 11:01.046
l enjoy a ''pile'' of breakfast as much
as the next guy, but l still think no.

11:01.420 --> 11:04.955
Are you planning on
going around like that all weekend?

11:05.133 --> 11:09.427
Yeah, why not? Daphne's off
on her little trip. lt's just us guys.

11:09.596 --> 11:13.628
Besides, l've been wearing pants
around here for three years. Enough.

11:13.863 --> 11:17.243
l see. Dad, l just have to do this.

11:17.300 --> 11:19.201
All right.

11:19.323 --> 11:24.116
lt's no big deal, but l couldn't find
the remote control for the TV last night.

11:24.248 --> 11:28.839
l thought we agreed that its place
was on that table next to my chair.

11:29.669 --> 11:32.702
What was it like when you
had to get up to change the channels?

11:32.874 --> 11:34.951
lt was hell!

11:37.850 --> 11:40.671
- You expecting someone?
- The contractor.

11:40.843 --> 11:43.416
l'm going to restore my study.

11:43.529 --> 11:47.595
- Why don't you use Joe?
- Joe's done enough work in that room.

11:50.059 --> 11:52.149
Henry. Thank you for coming.

11:52.196 --> 11:54.862
- No sweat.
- l'll just show you to the room.

11:55.774 --> 11:58.121
Oh, this is my father.
Don't get up!

11:59.699 --> 12:01.592
- Coffee?
- That'd be great.

12:01.630 --> 12:05.597
Fine. The room is down the hall
and to the right. l'll meet you there.

12:08.807 --> 12:13.671
Oh, Dad, this is a small thing but
you left the sponge in the sink again.

12:13.841 --> 12:14.590
So?

12:14.956 --> 12:21.389
lf it stays wet, it begins to smell and
becomes a breeding ground for bacteria.

12:21.559 --> 12:22.935
So?

12:23.102 --> 12:28.062
So if l were to say, wipe up that salsa
that you spilled on the table just now,

12:28.234 --> 12:32.861
l would be leaving behind bacteria
such as salmonella and listeria.

12:33.031 --> 12:36.033
- Wouldn't that bother you?
- Yeah, it would.

12:36.202 --> 12:39.203
l wouldn't dream of touching
that sponge now.

12:47.382 --> 12:52.722
Ah, yes.
Our own foul-breathed little Handy Wipe.

13:08.825 --> 13:13.203
You've left lights on all weekend. You
know what that does to the electric bill?

13:13.250 --> 13:17.128
They had to build a nuclear power plant
to keep that television on day and night.

13:19.463 --> 13:22.064
- You moved my chair again, didn't you?
- No.

13:22.186 --> 13:25.669
Maybe Eddie did.
Did you move my chair?

13:25.778 --> 13:28.862
Frasier would never mess with my stuff.

13:28.918 --> 13:33.346
l moved your chair! The way you have it
ruins the symmetry of the room.

13:33.522 --> 13:36.974
- The sight line loses all flow.
- Oh, the sight line.

13:37.151 --> 13:39.939
l thought it was for some dumb reason.

13:42.170 --> 13:44.423
And get Eddie off the couch,

13:44.499 --> 13:47.470
or it's down to the garbage chute
for the thrill ride of his life.

14:00.435 --> 14:04.516
- (Southern accent) Howdy partner.
- Save your snippy remarks.

14:04.553 --> 14:10.816
(English accent) Am l crazy or is there
a bright golden haze on the meadow?

14:13.279 --> 14:15.948
Stop it. l'm in a social crisis.

14:16.115 --> 14:18.475
l drove to
the Hoedown for the Homeless

14:18.535 --> 14:22.306
assuming that Maris had simply
neglected to forward my invitation.

14:22.787 --> 14:25.096
l was not on the guest list

14:25.190 --> 14:30.017
and the parking attendant said
he missed me at the Luau for Lupus.

14:32.051 --> 14:36.798
- lt's official. l'm a social outcast.
- Why do you care about those people?

14:36.974 --> 14:40.284
ln your hour of need
they pretend you don't even exist.

14:40.415 --> 14:42.721
They treat you like you're a leper.

14:42.898 --> 14:45.472
But l really, really like them.

14:46.355 --> 14:48.522
l know it makes me sound pathetic.

14:48.697 --> 14:52.888
But l'm newly separated. These people
have been my social circle for ten years.

14:52.954 --> 14:55.368
Frasier, they're my tribe.

14:55.803 --> 15:00.496
l hate to break this to you,
Waltzes With Snobs, but...

15:05.326 --> 15:08.890
...they have left you
on the mountaintop to die.

15:08.965 --> 15:12.468
Maybe your friends wanted to invite you

15:12.642 --> 15:15.405
but they thought
you'd be upset seeing Maris.

15:15.640 --> 15:18.477
Of course. You're absolutely right.

15:18.650 --> 15:22.144
- That's ridiculous.
- These people do care about me.

15:22.182 --> 15:24.656
Call them. Prove to me l'm wrong.

15:24.713 --> 15:28.610
- OK. Where's your phone?
- lt's in my bedroom.

15:28.714 --> 15:31.032
And Dad's shaver is in the kitchen.

15:31.098 --> 15:35.916
You see, all our appliances
are on an adventure this weekend.

15:40.593 --> 15:45.292
Proud of yourself? Why not let him think
his friends were doing him a favour?

15:45.442 --> 15:49.551
The Martin Crane approach -
better living through denial.

15:49.729 --> 15:53.349
lt's the same with Daphne. You couldn't
pretend nothing was going on.

15:53.842 --> 15:58.272
Dad, l'm a psychiatrist.
l don't pretend. l confront. l resolve.

15:58.448 --> 16:02.895
You really resolved this. She's moving
out. You go looking for trouble.

16:02.970 --> 16:05.736
Oh, that is so untrue.

16:05.916 --> 16:08.454
Perhaps you can explain this!

16:11.339 --> 16:15.207
A grown man's obsession
with a sponge? No, l can't!

16:15.744 --> 16:19.633
For the last two days l've asked you
again and again to wring out the sponge.

16:19.808 --> 16:22.097
But you don't even respect my feelings.

16:22.269 --> 16:26.600
- Your feelings are stupid.
- But they're my feelings!

16:26.774 --> 16:29.063
You should respect them.

16:29.163 --> 16:32.153
Like you respect mine
about my chair?

16:32.529 --> 16:36.571
- That makes no sense at all.
- You want me to dry that sponge?

16:36.618 --> 16:39.404
l'll dry that sponge!

16:41.941 --> 16:44.563
- Give it a minute.
- Oh, that's mature!

16:44.676 --> 16:47.923
What a tortured little world you live in.

16:48.092 --> 16:52.470
Newspapers strewn all over the place.
Sponge germs coming after you.

16:52.533 --> 16:56.389
- lt's a wonder you can sleep!
- My dreams get me by.

16:56.561 --> 16:59.182
Like the one where
l strap you in your chair

16:59.279 --> 17:03.485
and run around turning on all the lights,
even in the rooms l'm nowhere near.

17:03.577 --> 17:07.651
That electric meter
must really be spinning now!

17:09.867 --> 17:12.953
Evening, all.
Did you boys have a nice weekend?

17:13.048 --> 17:16.824
- Barrel of laughs.
- l had the loveliest time.

17:16.905 --> 17:18.304
Hey! Off!

17:19.018 --> 17:22.707
We found a bed and breakfast
up the coast.

17:22.884 --> 17:25.210
l talked my decision over with Joe,

17:25.270 --> 17:28.306
and he agreed
it's the best for everyone.

17:28.474 --> 17:33.433
l'll still be here during the day
to help your father with his exercises.

17:33.606 --> 17:35.466
But nights and weekends

17:35.560 --> 17:40.279
it'll just be you two carefree bachelors
getting into trouble together.

17:40.448 --> 17:43.366
l'm usually just underfoot
around here anyway.

17:43.535 --> 17:48.363
So you see,
my decision is best for everyone.

17:48.540 --> 17:52.954
Well, l've had a long weekend,
so good night.

17:54.333 --> 17:55.779
Good night, Daphne.

17:59.788 --> 18:02.546
- Frasier.
- What?

18:03.204 --> 18:08.680
You know how an Oreo has that
soft filling between two hard cookies?

18:09.066 --> 18:11.812
That's what keeps them together.

18:13.321 --> 18:16.857
- l see your point, Dad.
- Daphne's the centre.

18:17.034 --> 18:19.110
l'll go and talk to her.

18:19.287 --> 18:23.071
You and me, we'd be the cookie part.

18:23.900 --> 18:25.477
l get it.

18:33.679 --> 18:37.548
- May l come in?
- Yes, of course.

18:39.603 --> 18:43.388
Daphne...
You can't go. You have to stay.

18:43.566 --> 18:46.353
l've just realised
how important you are to us.

18:46.528 --> 18:49.980
lf you go,
Dad and l will kill each other.

18:50.362 --> 18:55.449
l'm not just tossing out hyperbole.
l'm speaking literally. Dad and l, dead.

18:55.506 --> 18:58.244
He'll have a bacteria-ridden sponge

18:58.417 --> 19:02.285
protruding from his mouth
like a bloated tongue.

19:03.048 --> 19:07.593
- Do you want that on your conscience?
- No, of course not.

19:07.762 --> 19:11.927
Truth is, l do still think
of this place as my home.

19:12.100 --> 19:15.601
But you'd never be comfortable
knowing Joe and l were...

19:15.772 --> 19:19.640
- l'd be willing to try.
- l know you better than that.

19:19.710 --> 19:22.025
We'll both be miserable.

19:22.071 --> 19:24.688
Why can't l get past this?

19:26.076 --> 19:29.742
lt'd be easier to pretend
you weren't in here making love.

19:31.041 --> 19:34.161
Making love?
ls that what you think we were doing?

19:34.337 --> 19:39.332
- Yes, of course.
- There was nothing like that going on.

19:40.656 --> 19:42.064
Really?

19:43.305 --> 19:46.675
Seems rather implausible.

19:46.851 --> 19:51.479
l'd like to believe that
and believe me l really do want to...

19:51.649 --> 19:53.523
How can l?

19:53.976 --> 19:58.737
How could Joe and l make love,
what with Joe's war injury.

20:01.870 --> 20:04.444
What war would that be?

20:04.623 --> 20:08.656
- The Falkland lslands.
- But that was a British conflict and...

20:08.694 --> 20:12.378
His parents have a summerhouse there.

20:14.093 --> 20:16.133
That's very unfortunate.

20:16.253 --> 20:18.795
Taking a summerhouse in a war zone.

20:19.295 --> 20:20.931
But how...?

20:21.101 --> 20:23.854
- He was kicked by a sheep.
- A sheep?

20:23.910 --> 20:27.476
A sheep spooked by an air-raid siren.
Work with me.

20:27.651 --> 20:29.810
l see.

20:29.987 --> 20:34.235
- So what you're saying is that Joe...
- Can't.

20:37.336 --> 20:41.448
- That changes everything.
- Yes, it does.

20:41.627 --> 20:43.703
But just so as we're clear,

20:43.879 --> 20:46.916
even though
there's no actual lovemaking,

20:47.023 --> 20:51.801
Joe and l can on occasion, say, read
poems to each other in here at night?

20:53.704 --> 20:55.746
As long as you don't read too loudly.

21:03.271 --> 21:04.482
She's staying.

21:05.556 --> 21:08.492
Turns out they're sleeping together...

21:08.660 --> 21:11.412
but not having sex.

21:13.159 --> 21:18.879
They can't because Joe was kicked
by a spooked sheep during an air raid

21:18.901 --> 21:23.544
while his family were vacationing
in the Falkland lslands during the war.

21:26.242 --> 21:30.934
Dad was right. They are my real friends.
lt was all just a misunderstanding.

21:31.104 --> 21:34.769
The social chairman's dog
ate my invitation.

21:36.652 --> 21:40.567
The poor animal had to go to the vet
and they forgot to send me another.

21:40.740 --> 21:42.952
When l offered my new address

21:42.961 --> 21:46.079
they said,
''No need. We'll see you around.''

21:49.167 --> 21:53.747
l'm going to start wearing sweat pants.
That damned dryer again.

21:56.217 --> 21:59.717
You guys want some cookies?
They're reduced fat.

22:00.081 --> 22:03.223
That means we can eat twice as many.

22:10.443 --> 22:15.901
# Hey baby, l hear the blues are calling
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:16.075 --> 22:17.451
# Oh, my!

22:17.618 --> 22:24.417
# And maybe l seem a bit confused
Well, maybe...but l got you pegged!

22:24.585 --> 22:30.459
# But l don't know what to do with those
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:30.634 --> 22:33.007
# They're calling again #

22:33.179 --> 22:36.264
Good night, Seattle, we love you!
