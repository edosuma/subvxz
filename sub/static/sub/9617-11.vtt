00:06.273 --> 00:10.175
Where's chelsea?
Why isn't she back yet?

00:10.177 --> 00:12.611
Honey, i'm sure farkle
took very good care of her.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.213
Hey, matthews,
why are you making us

00:14.215 --> 00:15.447
Do the whole class-mascot thing
anyway?

00:15.449 --> 00:17.182
Don't ruin this for me, maya.

00:17.184 --> 00:20.219
Everybody got the chance
to take chelsea home for a week

00:20.221 --> 00:22.855
And now it's my turn
and i'm looking forward to it.

00:22.857 --> 00:25.257
Good, because if you
bring her back safely,

00:25.259 --> 00:28.193
Chelsea will have survived
the whole class.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.928
Then it's as good as done.

00:29.930 --> 00:32.698
You know i am fantastic
with pets.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.600
Mr. Puffles.

00:34.602 --> 00:37.302
That was sad.

00:38.439 --> 00:41.306
It's chelsea!
It is.

00:41.308 --> 00:43.542
Nice job, farkle.

00:43.544 --> 00:46.245
Here's your sticker.

00:47.448 --> 00:49.481
Chelsea!

00:49.483 --> 00:52.284
Are you ready to come
to our house?

00:52.286 --> 00:53.519
Hey, farkle,

00:53.521 --> 00:55.587
Did you go
to phil's fish store?

00:55.589 --> 00:56.989
Why would you ask me that,
auggie?

00:56.991 --> 00:58.857
Why would you think that?
Why would you say that?  Why?

00:58.859 --> 01:01.293
Elementary, my dear farkle.

01:01.295 --> 01:03.495
There's a new castle
in the bowl.

01:03.497 --> 01:04.997
Very impressive, auggie.

01:04.999 --> 01:08.233
Yeah, he watches "owl detective"
every day.

01:08.235 --> 01:09.868
He always knows whodunnit.

01:09.870 --> 01:12.838
( sing-song )
hoooo-dunnit!

01:12.840 --> 01:14.740
Every day.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.742
Okay, riley,
she's all yours.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.944
Now all you have to do
is feed her once a day

01:18.946 --> 01:21.613
And every once in a while,
you throw her a compliment.

01:21.615 --> 01:23.482
You are talking
about the fish, right?

01:23.484 --> 01:25.451
No.

01:27.021 --> 01:29.288
All right, is she
all ready to go, auggie?

01:29.290 --> 01:31.523
All fed and ready to go.

01:31.525 --> 01:33.959
Riley, here's chelsea.

01:33.961 --> 01:35.994
She means the world to me.

01:36.964 --> 01:39.331
Don't blow this.

01:39.333 --> 01:40.966
This fish is in good hands.

01:40.968 --> 01:43.535
Let me just get
our first picture together.

01:43.537 --> 01:44.803
( clicks )

01:44.805 --> 01:46.472
Um...

01:46.474 --> 01:47.940
What?

01:47.942 --> 01:50.309
Let me take another one.
Chelsea's upside-down.

01:50.311 --> 01:51.376
Oh, boy.

01:51.378 --> 01:53.812
"day one, i died!"

01:53.814 --> 01:57.049
- ( all gasping )
- chelsea!

01:57.051 --> 01:59.451
No, i'll cry for you later.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.587
Right now there's a mystery
to be solved.

02:01.589 --> 02:04.590
What mystery, auggie?
I killed the fish.

02:04.592 --> 02:06.592
No, you did not
kill this fish.

02:06.594 --> 02:09.461
This fish was the victim
of foul play.

02:09.463 --> 02:14.299
Somebody here
is responsible.

02:14.301 --> 02:16.435
The only question is...

02:16.437 --> 02:17.703
Oh, no.

02:17.705 --> 02:21.406
All:
...Hooooo-dunnit?!

The dame was 39 lbs
of blue-eyed dynamite.

03:27.841 --> 03:31.843
T.N.T.-- Teeth...

03:31.845 --> 03:33.545
And teeth.

03:35.015 --> 03:37.849
( howling, panting )

03:38.986 --> 03:41.386
They call her "lady a"

03:41.388 --> 03:44.489
Because she writes
her "a"s good.

03:44.491 --> 03:48.860
Let's go over the suspect list,
doll face.

03:48.862 --> 03:51.597
I like when she calls me
doll face.

03:51.599 --> 03:54.433
Makes me feel dainty.

03:54.435 --> 03:58.036
Chelsea was kaput,
belly up.

03:58.038 --> 04:00.539
Of this,
there is no question.

04:00.541 --> 04:02.674
The only question was--

04:02.676 --> 04:04.676
I want to do this with you!

04:04.678 --> 04:06.912
Fine, on three.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.113
Both:
One--

04:08.115 --> 04:11.049
Hoooo-dunnit!

04:11.051 --> 04:13.652
Why do i always let you
get away with this?

04:13.654 --> 04:17.089
Because i've got the best
baby teeth in the business.

04:22.162 --> 04:25.597
Have my owl detectives
cracked the case?

04:25.599 --> 04:27.799
The other woman in my life.

04:27.801 --> 04:30.469
Some call her topanga.

04:30.471 --> 04:33.071
I call her mommy.

04:33.073 --> 04:36.074
- Ava?
- Topanga?

04:36.076 --> 04:39.011
These two are icier
than two popsicles...

04:39.013 --> 04:42.180
In alaska
in the winter

04:42.182 --> 04:44.182
That don't like each other.

04:44.184 --> 04:46.551
I brought
your favorite.

04:46.553 --> 04:49.588
Both:
Graham crackers!

04:59.166 --> 05:01.099
Maya.

05:01.101 --> 05:03.635
- Phil.
- Oh, you two know each other?

05:03.637 --> 05:05.671
Actually, i'm familiar
with your whole class.

05:05.673 --> 05:08.840
Oh, do you have a son
or daughter at john q. Adams?

05:08.842 --> 05:11.977
Well, you might say
i have a whole school of kids
at john q. Adams.

05:11.979 --> 05:15.747
What a random
and curious comment to make,
"fish store phil."

05:15.749 --> 05:18.784
- Oh, she doesn't--
- no no, this one's
very trusting and sensitive.

05:18.786 --> 05:20.686
Ooh, i like people
like that.

05:20.688 --> 05:22.487
Do you got your own debit card,
young lady?

05:22.489 --> 05:23.955
Phil.

05:23.957 --> 05:27.025
Sorry.

05:27.027 --> 05:30.128
It's our class goldfish,
chelsea.

05:30.130 --> 05:31.963
She made it
through the whole year,

05:31.965 --> 05:33.799
Right up until it was my turn
to take her home.

05:33.801 --> 05:35.867
And then she--

05:35.869 --> 05:38.203
And then she--
is she dead?

05:38.205 --> 05:42.741
Because either she is dead
or she is so so very tired.

05:42.743 --> 05:45.744
Can you wake her up,
"fish store phil?"

05:45.746 --> 05:48.046
( between teeth )
uh, what do i do?

05:48.048 --> 05:50.582
You wake her up, phil.

05:50.584 --> 05:53.118
Okay, i see how this is.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.754
Well,
it's a bright sunshiny day.

05:55.756 --> 05:58.123
<i>Time to wake up</i>
<i>and have some french toast</i>

05:58.125 --> 06:02.227
And get to the ol' fish job.

06:02.229 --> 06:03.862
Dead.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.831
Well, he tried.

06:05.833 --> 06:09.267
Yes, i tried really hard.

06:09.269 --> 06:12.771
Well, i guess i always knew,
"fish store phil."

06:12.773 --> 06:15.574
Chelsea did not survive riley.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.142
What will happen to her now?

06:17.144 --> 06:19.010
- Oh, she'll go in the potty.
- The potty?!

06:19.012 --> 06:21.546
Uh, whoop whoop,
"da party!"

06:21.548 --> 06:22.881
( both giggling )

06:22.883 --> 06:25.117
Okay, we'll go that way.

06:25.119 --> 06:27.152
Young lady,
how would you like

06:27.154 --> 06:29.921
To watch
your goldfish loved one

06:29.923 --> 06:33.058
Swim to that great fishbowl
in the sky?

06:33.060 --> 06:35.994
I would like that very much,
"fish store phil," yes.

06:35.996 --> 06:37.562
How does she get there?

06:37.564 --> 06:39.998
Well, the 4:15 express
is leaving right now.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.900
Get her on it!
Get her on it!

06:41.902 --> 06:43.835
Close your eyes with me, riley.
Let's bow our heads.

06:43.837 --> 06:44.936
Of course.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.677
<i>( toilet flushing )</i>

06:52.679 --> 06:54.045
What was that?

06:54.047 --> 06:56.615
That-- that was the sound
of chelsea's fish soul

06:56.617 --> 06:57.983
Swimming up
to fish heaven.

06:57.985 --> 07:00.018
But it sounded a lot
like a toilet--

07:00.020 --> 07:04.055
Who are you to question
the ways of fish heaven?

07:04.057 --> 07:07.959
Do you think you might
possibly have another one

07:07.961 --> 07:09.594
That looks like chelsea?

07:14.368 --> 07:18.036
Why don't you have yourself
a little looky-see

07:18.038 --> 07:20.739
And maybe you'll locate
another unique

07:20.741 --> 07:23.775
And one-of-a-kind
orange one.

07:32.219 --> 07:34.619
This one.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.087
( softly )
it's a miracle.

07:44.364 --> 07:47.232
Chelsea is replaced.

07:47.234 --> 07:51.703
So ends
the long, glorious reign
of chelsea the first,

07:51.705 --> 07:54.272
Long live chelsea ii!

07:55.909 --> 07:58.944
( french accent )
nobody <i> miff.</i>

07:58.946 --> 08:01.213
- Miff?
- No, don't <i> miff.</i>

08:01.215 --> 08:03.014
Don't miff?

08:03.016 --> 08:05.217
Too late.
You <i> miffed.</i>

08:07.120 --> 08:10.322
The reason you have all
been summoned here today

08:10.324 --> 08:12.858
Is that chelsea the first

08:12.860 --> 08:15.861
Is dead,

08:15.863 --> 08:17.095
<i>Which means</i>

08:17.097 --> 08:21.166
That one
of the people in this room is--

08:21.168 --> 08:23.935
( french accent )
a <i> muh-deh-her.</i>

08:32.312 --> 08:35.113
I'm going to talk
to farkle first.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.749
Why?
'cause you think i'll crack?

08:37.751 --> 08:40.118
Well, i'm not the one
who's going to crack, pally boy.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.120
It's going to take a lot better
than you to crack me.

08:45.692 --> 08:48.193
( both crunching crackers )

08:50.998 --> 08:53.031
Okay, um,

08:53.033 --> 08:56.201
I just need the sound
of graham-cracker crunching
to stop.

08:58.105 --> 09:00.438
It's just that particular sound

09:00.440 --> 09:02.507
That really bothers me.

09:02.509 --> 09:04.042
I need it to stop, please.

09:04.044 --> 09:07.913
Look, i don't even know
if you know you're doing it,

09:07.915 --> 09:10.015
But i need it to stop.
I really do.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.285
( sighs )
thank you.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.757
I can't take it!

09:18.759 --> 09:20.425
I confess!

09:20.427 --> 09:21.793
What?

09:21.795 --> 09:23.261
I killed chelsea.

09:28.235 --> 09:31.937
These don't taste as good
when you're a <i> muh-deh-her.</i>

09:39.112 --> 09:42.414
I'm not worthy of this sticker.
I'm not worthy.

09:44.384 --> 09:47.519
I can't believe
that you killed my fish, farkle.

09:47.521 --> 09:50.188
No, not your fish--
my fish.

09:50.190 --> 09:53.058
You weren't the only one
who had to replace chelsea.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.259
I replaced her too.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.027
What?  When?!

09:56.029 --> 09:57.495
In the middle
of my week.

09:57.497 --> 09:59.497
Everything went so well
on monday and tuesday.

09:59.499 --> 10:01.766
On wednesday, i decided
to give her a bath.

10:01.768 --> 10:02.867
What?!

10:02.869 --> 10:05.937
- On thursday--
- wait wait, go back.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.806
I took chelsea
to the birdbath.

10:07.808 --> 10:09.841
She looked like she
was having such a great time.

10:09.843 --> 10:13.078
I didn't think anything
when the first bird sat
on the telephone wire.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.847
Before you knew it,
i couldn't see the sky anymore.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.849
Did you know
goldfish can scream?

10:17.851 --> 10:20.085
- They can't.
- Then it was me!

10:20.087 --> 10:22.454
I scream like a goldfish.

10:23.924 --> 10:26.992
Anyway, all the birds
swooped down at the same time

10:26.994 --> 10:28.526
In a fascinating
migratory pattern.

10:28.528 --> 10:30.829
It was like
a national geographic special.

10:30.831 --> 10:33.465
<i>I caught a little</i>
<i>on my phone.</i>

10:33.466 --> 10:36.100
- <i> ( birds squawking )</i>
- <i> ( farkle screaming )</i>

10:36.103 --> 10:39.037
And surprisingly,
as smart as i am,

10:39.039 --> 10:40.939
You would think
i'd have learned my lesson

10:40.941 --> 10:42.807
Not to put the next chelsea
in a birdbath.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.143
This one i put
in my cat's water dish.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.912
You didn't?!

10:47.914 --> 10:50.215
Farkle ( on phone ):
<i>No, fluffy, new chelsea's</i>
<i>taking a bath!</i>

10:50.217 --> 10:52.083
<i>( cat meowing )</i>

10:52.085 --> 10:53.768
Anyhoo,

10:53.769 --> 10:55.452
I replaced my new chelsea
with another chelsea

10:55.455 --> 10:57.455
And came right to school.
So as you can see,

10:57.457 --> 10:59.824
I had nothing to do
with the death of your chelsea.

10:59.826 --> 11:03.328
So the current chelsea
isn't chelsea #2 at all.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.830
She's chelsea #4.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.966
( groans )
five.

11:07.968 --> 11:09.334
How?

11:09.336 --> 11:11.102
I was too ashamed to tell you

11:11.104 --> 11:14.139
About our trip
to the empire state building.

11:14.141 --> 11:16.007
I took her all the way up

11:16.009 --> 11:17.409
And sat her on the ledge.

11:17.411 --> 11:20.211
And then i said,
"lean back a little."

11:22.182 --> 11:25.116
And she listened to me.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.252
( wailing )

11:29.089 --> 11:31.890
So this is the hot seat, huh?

11:31.892 --> 11:34.492
It is when you're in it,
big boy.

11:34.494 --> 11:36.161
- Ava!
- Lucas.

11:36.163 --> 11:37.295
Me?

11:37.297 --> 11:39.130
Okay, lucas, spill it.

11:39.132 --> 11:40.565
- Spill what?
- The beans.

11:40.567 --> 11:42.901
- What does that mean?
- It's what owl detective says.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.102
Thank you, riley.

11:44.104 --> 11:45.603
You're welcome, i'm sure.

11:45.605 --> 11:47.372
So what about those beans?

11:47.374 --> 11:49.541
- I don't have any beans.
- Then sing like a canary.

11:49.543 --> 11:51.910
- I don't sing so good.
- Then let the cat
out of the bag.

11:51.912 --> 11:54.312
- I'm more of a dog person.
- Aw, me too.

11:55.549 --> 11:57.482
Just tell them what happened.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.384
I'm sure you have nothing
to hide.

12:01.254 --> 12:02.420
Do you?

12:02.422 --> 12:05.356
Let me take you back
to the week of the 15th.

12:05.358 --> 12:08.059
- I don't want to go.
- You took chelsea out
of the classroom.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.594
- I took her straight home.
- No stops?

12:09.596 --> 12:11.563
- I wouldn't call it a stop.
- So what would you call it?

12:11.565 --> 12:13.098
- I'd call it a pause.
- So you paused.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.066
Okay, i stopped.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.202
We had a baseball game
against einstein academy.

12:17.204 --> 12:18.203
Tiggleman was on the mound.

12:18.205 --> 12:19.904
Curve-ball tiggleman?

12:19.906 --> 12:22.107
Best in the league
and no one can hit it.

12:22.109 --> 12:23.641
- Except you.
- Except me.

12:23.643 --> 12:25.677
And he knows that,
but he is proud, see?

12:25.679 --> 12:27.645
So i says-- i says,
"tig, please.

12:27.647 --> 12:29.981
I put chelsea
in the bleachers 'cause
it's nice and shady over there,

12:29.983 --> 12:31.983
So lay off
the curve because
you know where it's going."

12:31.985 --> 12:33.418
- The bleachers.
- Yeah, the bleachers.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.953
Guess what pitch
the jerk throws.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.454
- The curve.
- The curve.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.523
So where'd you hit the ball,
lucas?

12:38.525 --> 12:41.092
It was impossible.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.194
Impossible, i tells ya.

12:43.196 --> 12:45.263
Chelsea caught
my home-run ball...

12:45.265 --> 12:47.132
In the head.

12:47.134 --> 12:50.168
The sound of her fishbowl
shattering has haunted me
ever since.

12:50.170 --> 12:54.038
Yeah, i was at the game.
I caught it all on my phone!

12:55.075 --> 12:56.975
- <i> ( bat hitting ball )</i>
- farkle: <i> Oh, no, run!</i>

12:56.977 --> 12:58.543
<i>Chelsea, run!</i>

12:58.545 --> 13:01.212
- Lucas: <i> Chelsea!</i>
- <i> ( glass shattering )</i>

13:01.214 --> 13:03.548
Announcer:
<i>Oh, you absolutely hate</i>
<i>to see this, folks.</i>

13:03.550 --> 13:06.017
<i>You're swimming around,</i>
<i>enjoying a great game</i>

13:06.019 --> 13:07.385
<i>And then boom! Dead!</i>

13:07.387 --> 13:09.654
<i>Meanwhile, lucas friar</i>
<i>crosses home plate</i>

13:09.656 --> 13:11.156
<i>And quincy wins!</i>

13:11.158 --> 13:13.291
You ran the bases?

13:13.293 --> 13:16.161
I had to.  Otherwise
she died for nothing.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.363
But i had nothing
to do with what happened
to your chelsea, riley.

13:18.365 --> 13:21.132
- I promise.
- You mean chelsea #6.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.333
Seven.

13:22.335 --> 13:25.203
I had a double header.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.343
You'll never break me, auggie.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.145
Oh, you'll blink first.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.313
What makes you so sure?

13:35.315 --> 13:36.981
I'm an owl.

13:39.186 --> 13:41.753
- All right,
i went through seven fish.
- What?!

13:41.755 --> 13:43.755
Riley, they're goldfish.
We're kids.

13:43.757 --> 13:45.356
Kids are the natural enemy
of goldfish

13:45.358 --> 13:47.091
And the natural meal ticket
of "fish store phil"

13:47.093 --> 13:48.226
Who makes a fortune
off of us.

13:48.228 --> 13:50.094
How can he make a fortune,
maya?

13:50.096 --> 13:51.362
They cost $1 each.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.565
He sells them to every kid
in every school

13:53.567 --> 13:55.733
In every class
in the tristate area.

13:55.735 --> 13:59.170
You do the math,
'cause you know me and math.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.539
Wow, phil the fish guy,

14:01.541 --> 14:06.244
Cleaning up on the heartbreak
of the class mascot business.

14:06.246 --> 14:08.646
Riley, i hate
to break it to you,

14:08.648 --> 14:11.316
But chelsea hasn't survived
any of us.

14:11.318 --> 14:13.418
Every kid in the class
replaced her.

14:13.420 --> 14:16.120
I am not gonna believe this.

14:16.122 --> 14:18.623
I know my classmates

14:18.625 --> 14:22.260
And they are a loving
and caring group of children,

14:22.262 --> 14:26.264
Who place value
on the spark of life

14:26.266 --> 14:29.767
Even in the smallest
of living creatures.

14:31.438 --> 14:33.605
Okay.

14:39.179 --> 14:42.280
All right, how many of you
knocked off a fish?

14:44.084 --> 14:46.084
How many fish
you all knocked off?

14:47.420 --> 14:49.254
<i>Et tu,  </i> yogi?

14:50.423 --> 14:52.056
No, he had three.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.093
Go on, get out of here.

14:55.095 --> 14:58.096
I can't even look
at you guys anymore.
Just get out of here!

15:00.367 --> 15:02.901
Chelsea 105,

15:02.903 --> 15:05.503
On behalf of
all of my fellow human beings,

15:05.505 --> 15:07.338
I am so sorry.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.173
You and your little
fish friends

15:09.175 --> 15:12.277
All deserve to be safe
in your goldfish bowls.

15:12.279 --> 15:16.114
I wish there was a way
you guys could all take care
of each other somehow.

15:16.116 --> 15:18.316
But you're only stuck with us.

15:19.719 --> 15:21.419
I am sorry.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.155
Okay, you're all free to go.

15:27.427 --> 15:32.196
Don't nobody leave town.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.100
What about my chelsea, auggie?

15:36.102 --> 15:38.503
Her killer
still walks among us.

15:38.505 --> 15:42.473
I just don't know hoooo!

15:47.347 --> 15:49.714
Hi, chelsea.

15:49.716 --> 15:52.317
Are you hungry?
Riley's right.

15:52.319 --> 15:55.853
We need to
take good care of you.

15:55.855 --> 15:58.156
Auggie, stop.
What are you doing?

15:58.158 --> 16:00.725
I'm feeding chelsea 105.

16:00.727 --> 16:03.294
You can't feed a fish
graham crackers.

16:03.296 --> 16:04.862
( all gasping )

16:04.864 --> 16:06.464
You can't?

16:06.466 --> 16:07.799
No!

16:07.801 --> 16:11.336
Well, this seems like
the real problem.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.848
Oh, no.

16:23.850 --> 16:28.319
I-i-i-i-i-dunnit!

16:37.931 --> 16:41.933
Aw, honey, don't be sad.
You solved the case!

16:41.935 --> 16:44.702
I fed chelsea graham crackers.

16:44.704 --> 16:45.903
Maybe that wasn't it.

16:45.905 --> 16:48.239
Oh, it was it!

16:48.241 --> 16:49.874
Ava!

16:49.876 --> 16:52.543
She's right.
Graham crackers expand in water.

16:52.545 --> 16:53.911
- Farkle!
- He's right.

16:53.913 --> 16:56.714
- So the crumbs
expanded inside her.
- Lucas!

16:56.716 --> 16:58.549
- He's right.
- Maya!

16:58.551 --> 17:00.785
( exploding sound )

17:02.355 --> 17:04.922
I 'sploded chelsea 104.

17:04.924 --> 17:08.459
I feel bad for what i done.
Will i ever feel better?

17:12.732 --> 17:16.300
No, you probably shouldn't
put her near me.

17:16.302 --> 17:18.469
Why not?  She's yours.

17:18.471 --> 17:19.670
She is?

17:21.908 --> 17:24.342
Yeah, you take this one.

17:24.344 --> 17:28.279
I'm going to
pay phil the fish guy
one more little visit.

17:28.281 --> 17:29.714
But i made a mistake.

17:29.716 --> 17:33.217
But i know you, auggie.
You won't do it again.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.552
It is no mystery to me

17:34.554 --> 17:37.355
That you'll
take very good care of her.

17:39.492 --> 17:42.627
My sister is some dame,
ain't she?

17:42.629 --> 17:44.662
She knows just how
to pick up the spirits

17:44.664 --> 17:47.331
Of a heartbroken
little detective like me.

17:53.640 --> 17:57.909
This wraps up the case
of the fish who ate
the graham cracker.

17:57.911 --> 18:00.244
Now that i heard
the name of the case,

18:00.246 --> 18:02.880
I guess i should have known
what happened.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.793
How ya doin', phil?

18:15.795 --> 18:18.963
Well, my my my.
What have we here?

18:18.965 --> 18:22.700
All my favorite customers
here at the same time.

18:22.702 --> 18:25.036
Ooh, excuse me a minute
while i consider

18:25.038 --> 18:27.839
Which chateau in france
i'll be staying at this summer.

18:27.841 --> 18:32.276
One goldfish for
our whole class, please.

18:32.278 --> 18:35.847
Looks like
you finally met your match
on this one, phil.

18:35.849 --> 18:37.281
Hmm!

18:37.283 --> 18:39.684
Y'all gonna keep this one alive,
huh, birdbath?

18:39.686 --> 18:42.286
- ( laughs )
- what you laughin' at, slugger?

18:42.288 --> 18:43.621
Nothing.

18:45.058 --> 18:47.291
We'll take this one.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.527
Okay.

18:49.528 --> 18:51.762
How long are goldfish
supposed to live?

18:51.764 --> 18:55.700
Well, with proper care,
they can go 15, 20 years.

18:55.702 --> 18:57.969
Then that's
when we'll see you next.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.437
Right, guys?

19:00.607 --> 19:02.573
I hope so, kid.
I'll miss you.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.108
- You will?
- Yeah.

19:04.110 --> 19:07.612
You're sincere, you're honest.
You changed me today.

19:07.614 --> 19:09.046
Really?

19:09.048 --> 19:12.083
Yeah.
That'll be $17,000.

19:12.085 --> 19:15.386
- Phil.
- Okay.

19:16.956 --> 19:18.923
This one's on me.

19:18.925 --> 19:21.692
Thank you, "fish store phil."

19:36.643 --> 19:41.345
Okay, dad,
so what was the purpose
of this horrible lesson?

19:41.347 --> 19:42.980
There was no lesson.

19:42.982 --> 19:45.950
Oh, come on, matthews.
There's always a lesson
with you.

19:45.952 --> 19:48.452
You wouldn't have
put these goldfish
in our hands for no reason.

19:48.454 --> 19:49.987
Sorry, guys.

19:49.989 --> 19:51.556
No lesson here,

19:51.558 --> 19:54.358
Except whatever
you came up with.

19:55.461 --> 19:59.797
This goldfish is going
to live 15 years.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.949
Why is that?

20:01.950 --> 20:04.100
Because there's supposed to be
that much life in her.

20:04.103 --> 20:07.104
And everything alive
deserves to be--

20:07.106 --> 20:08.539
Cared for the right way.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.076
Very good.

20:12.078 --> 20:13.978
Oh, by the way...

20:13.980 --> 20:16.480
All:
I knew it!

20:16.482 --> 20:19.450
Permission slips
for the class retreat.

20:19.452 --> 20:22.053
We're going to
the berkshire mountains
this year.

20:22.055 --> 20:25.022
I want you to all
watch out for each other.

20:25.024 --> 20:28.092
Let's bring everybody home
safe and sound.

20:28.094 --> 20:30.061
You think you can do that?

20:36.102 --> 20:39.070
Yeah, i think you can too.

20:56.990 --> 20:58.789
( sighs )

20:58.791 --> 21:02.793
Chelsea, chelsea, chelsea,

21:02.795 --> 21:05.663
Chelsea, chelsea,

21:05.665 --> 21:08.666
Chelsea, chelsea,

21:08.668 --> 21:11.569
Chelsea, chelsea,

21:11.571 --> 21:14.138
Chelsea, chelsea,

21:14.140 --> 21:17.942
Chelsea, chelsea.
