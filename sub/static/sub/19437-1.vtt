Come on! Let's go!
Let's get out!

01:57.600 --> 01:58.600
Motherfucker!

02:03.440 --> 02:05.192

02:07.200 --> 02:08.199
Ah!

02:14.960 --> 02:16.632

02:20.320 --> 02:21.320

02:24.800 --> 02:26.313
I'm out!
Stay down!

02:29.480 --> 02:30.480
Shit!

02:41.760 --> 02:43.591
Shit. What do we do?

02:43.800 --> 02:47.076
Forget about the bag.
Let's get out of here. Come on, man.

02:47.160 --> 02:48.513
Get in. Let's go.

02:54.160 --> 02:56.958
Let's go. Let's go. Come on!

02:57.320 --> 02:59.959
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Come on!

03:00.280 --> 03:01.280
Hit it!

03:02.080 --> 03:03.911
What the fuck was that?

03:23.640 --> 03:25.437
Shit. What the fuck was that?
Not sure.

03:25.520 --> 03:26.840
Fucking couple guys,
couple kilos.

03:26.880 --> 03:28.856
No, man. That was some Reservoir
Dog shit back there, man.

03:28.880 --> 03:30.880
I didn't know they was gonna
come in hot like that.

03:31.360 --> 03:32.896
How much is in there?
That bag is heavy.

03:32.920 --> 03:34.273
Shit. Just from my eyes,

03:34.400 --> 03:35.879
got to be 25 or
better in here, man.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.228
Oh, God,
there ain't no 25.

03:37.400 --> 03:38.680
Yeah, yeah.
Got to be 25 or more.

03:38.880 --> 03:40.856
Hey, man, listen. Now, I ain't
got my calculator with me,

03:40.880 --> 03:42.896
but they got to be, like, seven
or eight million on the streets.

03:42.920 --> 03:45.176
That's enough for you to get some
plastic surgery and fix your face.

03:45.200 --> 03:46.296
My face is beautiful.
Why would I change that?

03:46.320 --> 03:48.376
What the fuck you mean? Your mask came off.
They saw you, nigga.

03:48.400 --> 03:49.456
It don't matter.
I like my face.

03:49.480 --> 03:50.696
It don't matter?
It's a work of art right here.

03:50.720 --> 03:53.917
All right, man. Whatever you say.
It's your life, bro.

04:38.200 --> 04:40.000
Hey, it's me.
I got called for a double.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.877
So you got to take
Thomas to his game.

04:41.960 --> 04:44.190
Just come get him
from the hospital at 3:30

04:44.320 --> 04:46.515
and Vin,
don't fuck it up again.

04:46.640 --> 04:48.232
Bye.

05:45.920 --> 05:47.069
We ran that down.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.475
Yeah, we'll know by 4:00.

05:50.920 --> 05:52.080
Yeah, this is Officer Watson.

06:00.880 --> 06:01.880
Dr. Sorenson.

06:02.680 --> 06:05.194
Ruby.

06:05.320 --> 06:07.016
You missed our
appointment this morning.

06:07.040 --> 06:09.474
I cannot approve your return
to the workplace till we talk.

06:12.360 --> 06:15.796
Guys at the department are concerned
about your recent behavior.

06:15.880 --> 06:17.279
The guys at the department?

06:17.360 --> 06:19.715
The whole damn department
is gossiping about me.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.191
Well...

06:23.360 --> 06:24.873
How does that
make you feel?

06:25.720 --> 06:27.551
How's that make me feel?

06:27.680 --> 06:28.795
Fucking fantastic.

06:32.720 --> 06:34.551
Why don't you
tell me what happened

06:34.680 --> 06:36.398
in your own words?

06:40.840 --> 06:41.909
Okay.

06:43.160 --> 06:45.390
Say it out loud,
or I'm gonna keep this.

06:48.720 --> 06:51.154
I thought I was walking
into a controlled situation.

06:51.240 --> 06:52.753
Instead, I found
myself in the middle

06:52.880 --> 06:54.376
of a meth lab with
a pissed off junkie.

06:54.400 --> 06:55.435
He assaulted you?

06:55.560 --> 06:57.676
He kicked my ass.
Okay?

06:58.720 --> 06:59.869
Okay.

06:59.960 --> 07:01.632
Meth labs aren't quiet.
Meth labs stink.

07:01.720 --> 07:02.920
Someone knew
the lab was there,

07:03.080 --> 07:04.416
and someone was paid
to look the other way.

07:04.440 --> 07:05.440
I hear you.

07:06.680 --> 07:07.829
Good. Good.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.558
So you know I have
to get back to work.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.318
I have to figure
this thing out.

07:11.400 --> 07:14.278
'Cause this city is
crawling with dirty cops.

07:14.360 --> 07:15.509
Do you hear that?

07:21.520 --> 07:23.192
Bryant.

07:23.440 --> 07:24.668
Okay.

07:25.680 --> 07:28.353
So this is my partner
on the other line.

07:28.440 --> 07:30.416
They found government-issued
bullets at a crime scene.

07:30.440 --> 07:33.352
So can I go do my job, or do you
want to keep talking bullshit?

07:37.440 --> 07:38.634
I'm on my way.

07:40.480 --> 07:43.199
Thank you.
I feel so much better now.

07:46.480 --> 07:47.480
Jennifer...

07:52.720 --> 07:54.312
Morning, Lieutenant.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.751
So at 0427, a squad
car got a shots fired call

07:58.840 --> 08:00.876
about the same
time we got a report

08:01.000 --> 08:04.072
about a late-model sedan
speeding near Old Downtown.

08:04.160 --> 08:06.310
The unit checking
out the shots fired

08:06.400 --> 08:07.736
went into an alley
off of Third Street

08:07.760 --> 08:09.040
where they found
two dead bodies.

08:09.440 --> 08:11.829
These responding officers
report casings everywhere.

08:11.920 --> 08:13.194
And I mean everywhere.

08:13.320 --> 08:14.673
Oh, we'll take that.

08:14.760 --> 08:15.829
Me and Cass.

08:15.960 --> 08:17.456
No, no. I'm giving it to
Emerson and Flannigan.

08:17.480 --> 08:20.000
You want Cagney and Lacey to take
it or you wanna get it solved?

08:23.080 --> 08:25.435
All right, hotshot,
it's yours.

08:25.520 --> 08:26.999
Yeah.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.471
Let's go, partner.

08:31.080 --> 08:33.400
Hey, say, nigga, are you high?
What the fuck are you doing?

08:33.480 --> 08:35.436
Yeah, a little bit.
We got to control this case.

08:35.520 --> 08:37.351
We control the case,
we control the evidence.

08:37.440 --> 08:38.640
That might be
the smartest shit

08:38.720 --> 08:39.936
or the dumbest
shit you ever did.

08:39.960 --> 08:42.871
Yeah, it might be.
The dumbest shit was this morning.

09:29.400 --> 09:30.879
Looking for this?

09:35.000 --> 09:36.274
I'm looking for everything.

09:36.360 --> 09:38.794
It's police-issued,
and there's more of them.

09:38.880 --> 09:40.711
Looks like the same
gun killed the big guy.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.231
Vincent Downs, Homicide.

09:44.400 --> 09:45.594
Jennifer Bryant.

09:45.680 --> 09:47.159
That's my partner,
Doug Dennison.

09:47.240 --> 09:48.389
We're internal affairs.

09:49.240 --> 09:52.755
Okay. So that's all you got, huh?
Government-issue?

09:52.840 --> 09:55.593
This one's got an employee ID
from the Luxus casino.

09:55.680 --> 09:56.795
The big guy?

09:56.880 --> 10:00.031
He's a special snowflake.
Arrest records going back 12 years.

10:01.400 --> 10:02.628
What happened to your face?

10:02.720 --> 10:04.631
Why don't you
take a closer look?

10:04.720 --> 10:06.920
It's just everybody's been
talking about your situation.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.589
Talk of the town.

10:10.960 --> 10:12.359
What happened to your face?

10:12.440 --> 10:15.400
Nothing happened to my face. This is a
face that pays attention to details.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.589
Speaking of details,

10:16.720 --> 10:18.696
I thought Emerson and Flannigan
were assigned to this case.

10:18.720 --> 10:20.915
No, no. Maybe you
shouldn't think, Bryant.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.353
Me and my partner
got the call.

10:22.440 --> 10:23.634
You did?

10:23.760 --> 10:25.536
Anyway, I was just looking out
for a fellow officer.

10:25.560 --> 10:26.560
Huh.

10:26.920 --> 10:28.400
You should put some
ice on that. Yeah.

10:28.440 --> 10:29.714
Yeah.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.631
I'll get some for you, too.

10:44.280 --> 10:45.395
Ladies and gentlemen,

10:45.480 --> 10:47.072
Nevada's finest.

10:47.160 --> 10:48.576
I feel like I need a shower.

10:48.600 --> 10:49.874
What'd
that guy want?

10:50.000 --> 10:52.389
He lied to me when I asked him
why he was on the case.

10:52.480 --> 10:54.835
Vegas PD fucking with
an IA investigation.

10:54.920 --> 10:56.911
- Got a bulldog.
- Yeah. Love it.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.150
We should look
into that, Sherlock.

11:10.520 --> 11:12.750
Clinical nurse specialist, 613.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.798
Available clinical nurse specialist,
dial 613, please.

11:22.520 --> 11:25.751
Blood gas tech to CCU, stat.

11:25.880 --> 11:28.519
Hey.

11:28.640 --> 11:30.596
I said 3:30. He's got
to be there by 4:00.

11:30.680 --> 11:32.272
Sorry.
I was grabbing you some...

11:32.400 --> 11:34.016
Some flowers. That's
why I was running late.

11:34.040 --> 11:35.040
Thank you.

11:38.320 --> 11:39.320
What's that?

11:40.120 --> 11:41.696
I was gonna tell you,
but you kept canceling.

11:41.720 --> 11:44.359
What is this?
What kind of ring is this?

11:44.440 --> 11:45.873
It's an engagement ring.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.120
It's from Dave? Yeah, it's Dave.
Who else would it be?

11:48.160 --> 11:49.639
D, what are you doing?

11:49.720 --> 11:51.119
What am I...
What are you doing?

11:51.200 --> 11:53.496
Is this somebody you want to spend
the rest of your life with?

11:53.520 --> 11:54.560
Have you thought this out?

11:54.640 --> 11:55.640
Yeah. Dave shows up.

11:55.720 --> 11:56.948
Dave takes care of your son.

11:57.080 --> 11:58.376
I don't care how
many times he shows up.

11:58.400 --> 11:59.696
He ain't his father.
I'm his father.

11:59.720 --> 12:00.755
I know you are.

12:00.880 --> 12:01.920
You gotta respect that, D.

12:03.120 --> 12:04.189
Yeah.

12:04.880 --> 12:07.474
So what am I supposed to do?
What, he's just supposed to...

12:07.560 --> 12:10.000
You're supposed to come in and
take care of your family? That?

12:10.080 --> 12:11.638
Okay, D.

12:12.400 --> 12:14.470
All right. All right.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.994
Look, he's got to go.
His game is now.

12:20.080 --> 12:22.056
You got to pick him up 'cause
I got stuff I got to do...

12:22.080 --> 12:23.296
No, no. Not again.
Not again. Not again.

12:23.320 --> 12:24.389
You go pick him up.

12:24.480 --> 12:26.440
I have to work a double.
You got to figure it out.

12:28.400 --> 12:29.640
All right, baby,
enjoy your dad.

12:30.320 --> 12:32.834
Drop him off by 9:00 p.m.
Okay?

12:34.080 --> 12:35.752
Give me my flowers back.

12:37.520 --> 12:39.078
9:00 p.m. Bye, baby.

12:39.720 --> 12:40.755
Bye.

12:44.280 --> 12:45.918
Hey, son.

12:49.440 --> 12:50.873
Want some flowers?

13:00.200 --> 13:02.430
How come you didn't
tell me about Dave?

13:02.520 --> 13:04.176
How come you didn't tell me
he coming around more?

13:04.200 --> 13:05.456
You should have told me that.
We men.

13:05.480 --> 13:06.736
Supposed to be
man-to-man on that.

13:06.760 --> 13:08.056
You supposed to let me know
what's going on.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.149
Why the hell you care?

13:09.280 --> 13:10.560
Because it's my
business to care.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.920
Well, he's moving in next week.
No, no.

13:14.080 --> 13:16.640
No, ain't nobody doing that.
Not doing that. Not doing that.

13:16.720 --> 13:18.080
You need a place
to stay, you gonna

13:18.120 --> 13:19.456
come stay with me.
I got plenty of room.

13:19.480 --> 13:20.959
You got room.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.155
Yeah, I got room.

13:22.280 --> 13:23.520
What am I,
a piece of furniture?

13:24.480 --> 13:26.311
You don't care where I live,
who I live with.

13:26.760 --> 13:28.955
You were never home when
Mom and I lived with you!

13:36.000 --> 13:37.479
You see now...

13:39.280 --> 13:41.475
I love your mom, I love you.

13:41.560 --> 13:42.879
It's just...

13:43.640 --> 13:45.232
Things that...
That I can't explain.

13:45.320 --> 13:47.072
It just gets complicated.

14:04.680 --> 14:05.680
Radio don't work.

14:13.160 --> 14:14.229
Take it out.

14:15.760 --> 14:17.360
Remember what I told
you to do with that.

14:18.520 --> 14:20.576
You pull that trigger,
you better have your mind made up.

14:20.600 --> 14:22.079
'Cause you can't
take it back.

14:23.040 --> 14:24.359
And whatever you aiming at,

14:27.320 --> 14:28.878
make sure you
prepared to kill it.

14:54.240 --> 14:55.240
Yeah?

14:55.320 --> 14:57.709
Mr. Downs,
this is Stan Rubino.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.232
I learned you have
something that's mine.

15:01.240 --> 15:03.231
The 25 kilos of
cocaine you stole.

15:03.440 --> 15:04.839
Listen, that was a mistake.

15:04.920 --> 15:06.114
I'll get you your product.

15:06.200 --> 15:09.476
Look, if you hurt him...
You know what it is.

15:09.560 --> 15:12.916
Mr. Downs,
let's not get carried away.

15:14.200 --> 15:15.758
I guess you know
what kind of man I am.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Okay. Okay.

15:17.080 --> 15:19.116
I'll get your stuff and
I'll bring it right to you.

15:19.200 --> 15:23.159
In three hours, Rob Novak's
coming to pick up 25 kilos.

15:23.240 --> 15:24.389
If I can't deliver them,

15:24.880 --> 15:26.120
I'll give him your son instead.

15:26.240 --> 15:27.514
Please.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.033
He's only 16.

15:29.960 --> 15:31.075
He's 16.

15:31.240 --> 15:32.639
Yes, I know.

15:39.400 --> 15:40.400
Shari, how's your mom?

15:40.440 --> 15:42.351
She's better.
Thank you for the flowers.

15:42.440 --> 15:44.271
Oh, it's the least
we could do.

16:22.960 --> 16:26.475
Hey, this is Bryant. I need a file
on an officer. Vincent Downs.

16:27.120 --> 16:30.317
Contact information,
license plate, family info.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.150
What can you give
me without approval?

16:38.160 --> 16:39.673
Thank you.

17:22.240 --> 17:23.240
What's up with you?

17:24.240 --> 17:27.198
You all right? Man, where
all this blood come from?

17:28.079 --> 17:29.354
You messed up, Cass.

17:29.440 --> 17:30.509
What you mean?

17:30.600 --> 17:31.953
Stan Rubino got Thomas.

17:32.080 --> 17:33.433
Stan Rubino got Thomas?

17:33.560 --> 17:34.576
The manager from the Luxus?

17:34.600 --> 17:35.656
Yeah, the manager from Luxus.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.033
You fucked up.
What the fuck...

17:37.160 --> 17:39.376
See, we weren't stealing from Rubino.
You were stealing from Novak.

17:39.400 --> 17:40.896
You got us fucked up
in some Novak shit!

17:40.920 --> 17:42.831
I didn't... I didn't know...
How you not know?

17:43.240 --> 17:44.856
They said it was just
gonna be an easy grab.

17:44.880 --> 17:46.598
Well, it ain't no easy grab!
They got T!

17:47.920 --> 17:50.096
Man, well, we gotta...
Man, they gonna kill... They gonna...

17:50.120 --> 17:52.190
I know what they doin'!
I need that bag!

17:52.280 --> 17:54.176
Hey, listen, you know I wouldn't
do that shit on purpose!

17:54.200 --> 17:55.235
Then why'd you do it?

17:55.400 --> 17:56.435
Hey, man, I didn't know!

17:56.520 --> 17:58.033
Man, I love Thomas
like he my own!

17:58.160 --> 17:59.673
Had one day with him!

17:59.760 --> 18:01.512
Hey, listen,
I understand you upset.

18:01.760 --> 18:03.955
Man, I'll fix it.
Calm down.

18:04.240 --> 18:05.389
Get the bag.

18:07.080 --> 18:10.038
I can't believe you thought
I'd do some shit like that, man.

18:10.600 --> 18:12.431
I hit you when
I'm on the way back.

18:25.600 --> 18:27.079
Oh, God.

18:34.600 --> 18:35.635
Rob.

18:36.440 --> 18:37.953
You don't have to do this.

18:38.960 --> 18:40.313
We're family, man.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.350
You don't do this to family,
okay? Please!

18:43.440 --> 18:48.036
Please. Please.
Okay, I am sorry, okay?

18:48.280 --> 18:51.033
I am so, so sorry.

18:51.120 --> 18:52.439
You don't... Please.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.637
Please don't do this.
Please don't do this!

19:00.200 --> 19:01.200
Ahhh!

19:07.280 --> 19:10.317
Friend of mine gave me
some cell phone records.

19:11.120 --> 19:13.634
Three weeks ago, two calls.

19:14.760 --> 19:17.479
And five calls Thursday
and four more yesterday

19:18.040 --> 19:20.429
from your phone to the DEA.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.392
That wasn't me.

19:22.520 --> 19:24.158
Listen, you dumb motherfucker,

19:24.280 --> 19:26.336
you think that we don't have
people who we pay to tell us

19:26.360 --> 19:28.316
when our relatives
call the fucking DEA?

19:28.440 --> 19:31.113
I'm sorry. I was with this girl
in Agua Prieta, all right?

19:31.200 --> 19:36.035
And the DEA, they busted us and
they asked me all these questions.

19:36.720 --> 19:39.553
You know what my father always said
about your side of the family?

19:40.960 --> 19:42.916
You only think
with your dick.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.992
It's always this fat
girl and that fat girl.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.475
And that's why you
turned out so stupid.

19:50.200 --> 19:54.591
'Cause your daddy married
your mom and fucked her.

19:59.240 --> 20:00.639
Sweet lady.

20:00.760 --> 20:03.672
But not the kind of face you want to
look at for the rest of your life.

20:07.560 --> 20:08.709
DEA bust.

20:09.760 --> 20:11.830
My cut house
raided last week.

20:12.600 --> 20:14.033
The position I'm in,

20:14.680 --> 20:16.989
I got to go begging
a fuck-nut scumbag

20:17.120 --> 20:19.429
like Stanley Rubino
for 25 kilos.

20:20.360 --> 20:21.395
It's embarrassing.

20:22.080 --> 20:23.399
Even worse...

20:24.400 --> 20:26.868
The whole goddamn world
knows I'm vulnerable.

20:35.720 --> 20:37.199
I'm sorry.

20:38.120 --> 20:40.918
Yeah, I know you are.

20:47.400 --> 20:48.594
Cut off his tongue.

20:49.080 --> 20:50.877
Make sure he
doesn't ever use it again.

20:51.080 --> 20:53.514
No, no. Rob!
Rob, come back!

20:53.600 --> 20:55.989
You can't do this. Please! Please!
Please, don't do...

20:56.080 --> 20:57.593
Please don't do this to me!

20:57.760 --> 21:00.069
No, no, no.

21:00.400 --> 21:01.753
No, please...

21:03.080 --> 21:05.469
Come on. Let me out!

21:06.720 --> 21:08.312
Anyone!

21:08.400 --> 21:09.594
Help!

21:13.760 --> 21:14.875
Shit!

21:33.240 --> 21:34.240
Shit.

21:36.160 --> 21:37.195
Hey, D.

21:37.280 --> 21:38.280
Where's Thomas, Vin?

21:38.800 --> 21:39.800
It's okay.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.936
No, his coach called, said he
missed the game. Where is he?

21:41.960 --> 21:44.235
Yeah, yeah. He took
off a little while ago.

21:44.320 --> 21:45.548
But I think I
know where he is.

21:45.640 --> 21:46.868
I'm going to
get him right now.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.296
He took off?
He'd never miss a game.

21:48.320 --> 21:50.515
Look, D,
T and I had a little fight.

21:50.600 --> 21:53.876
So I think he's just
punishing me right now.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
What kind of fight, Vin?

21:55.080 --> 21:56.080
I don't know.

21:56.160 --> 21:57.559
He was just
being him, you know?

21:57.640 --> 21:58.936
And I'm sure you
were just being you.

21:58.960 --> 22:00.075
Yeah.

22:00.160 --> 22:02.071
Look, at the end of the day,

22:02.160 --> 22:03.720
I told him no,
he couldn't do something,

22:03.840 --> 22:06.479
he got pissed off, he took off,
so I think I know where he is.

22:06.600 --> 22:07.800
I'm gonna go
get him right now.

22:07.840 --> 22:08.955
Find him.

23:01.240 --> 23:02.992
First floor.

23:26.200 --> 23:27.269
There.

23:28.400 --> 23:29.799
What the hell's he doing?

23:31.400 --> 23:33.709
First floor.

23:52.600 --> 23:53.600
Novak.

23:55.480 --> 23:56.480
Hey, Rob.

23:57.600 --> 24:00.751
Yeah, and we're finally
all set here. Right.

24:01.080 --> 24:03.913
Meet you on the floor.
Bye.

24:48.360 --> 24:49.429
Follow me.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.594
Police. There was a man in
here a few minutes ago.

25:05.680 --> 25:07.557
He had a duffel bag.
I didn't notice.

25:07.640 --> 25:09.198
It was a big duffel bag.

25:09.320 --> 25:10.992
And I'm telling
you I didn't notice.

25:12.640 --> 25:13.640
What are you doing?

25:14.840 --> 25:16.512
This is the men's room.

25:18.520 --> 25:21.193
Okay. Okay. Okay.

25:21.720 --> 25:25.190
There was a guy banging around
just like you in that one.

25:29.040 --> 25:30.136
You should have
said he was black,

25:30.160 --> 25:32.390
6-feet-tall,
banging around in the stalls.

25:32.760 --> 25:34.296
Then I would have known
who you were talking about.

25:34.320 --> 25:36.356
Well, thanks.
I'll work on my descriptions.

26:11.560 --> 26:13.357
Motherfucker.

26:14.240 --> 26:15.673
I knew it.

26:42.040 --> 26:43.189
Where are my drugs?

26:43.280 --> 26:44.599
Where's my son?

26:51.760 --> 26:52.760
Dad!

26:54.440 --> 26:55.440
What's goin' on?

26:55.600 --> 26:56.635
It's gonna be okay.

26:57.600 --> 26:58.600
Come on, man.

26:59.080 --> 27:00.274
You steal from me...

27:02.400 --> 27:03.469
And you kill my guys.

27:03.600 --> 27:05.272
Let's just figure it out.

27:05.400 --> 27:07.277
You stupid shit.

27:08.600 --> 27:10.875
This is the biggest
amount I ever moved.

27:10.960 --> 27:12.976
You think I wouldn't protect
it with everything I've got?

27:13.000 --> 27:15.230
Look, we didn't know
the drugs was yours.

27:15.360 --> 27:18.158
You have no idea what kind
of mess you've made here.

27:19.120 --> 27:21.634
That cocaine is supposed
to go to the Novaks.

27:22.160 --> 27:24.196
You know what
they're capable of.

27:24.280 --> 27:28.068
How am I supposed to
explain this to Rob Novak?

27:28.160 --> 27:29.434
Or his father?

27:29.800 --> 27:31.000
If Frank gets involved here...

27:31.360 --> 27:32.475
I got your drugs.

27:35.480 --> 27:36.595
I got the rest stashed.

27:37.640 --> 27:39.119
I'll get it to you
when I get my son.

27:50.040 --> 27:51.678
I don't get you, Downs.

27:53.200 --> 27:57.034
There's a right way to do
things and a wrong way.

27:58.840 --> 28:03.197
I just don't think that you
respect the established protocol.

28:06.200 --> 28:07.200
Yeah.

28:09.080 --> 28:10.991
The right way is how
I usually do things.

28:11.080 --> 28:12.274
Ten minutes.

28:13.040 --> 28:16.555
I'll bring it back in
10 minutes, get my son.

28:19.880 --> 28:22.599
No, where am I going?
Dad!

28:22.720 --> 28:24.358
Ten minutes.

28:25.400 --> 28:28.040
How do I know if I bring you that coke,
you don't give my son back?

28:31.320 --> 28:32.355
Shall we?

28:54.720 --> 28:55.835
Hello?

28:56.080 --> 28:57.718
I followed Vincent Downs
to the Luxus.

28:57.840 --> 28:59.376
What do you mean,
you followed Vincent Downs?

28:59.400 --> 29:01.675
We discussed it. You said
he was worth looking into.

29:01.800 --> 29:04.837
Yeah, looking into does not
mean tailing, Nancy Drew.

29:04.920 --> 29:08.117
He hid 23 kilos of coke in the
ceiling of the men's bathroom.

29:08.200 --> 29:10.236
So I'm saying he was
worth looking into.

29:10.320 --> 29:12.515
Okay, seal off the bathroom.
I'm on my way.

29:12.600 --> 29:13.874
I took it out of the bathroom.

29:14.160 --> 29:16.680
You moved evidence without properly
conducting an investigation?

29:16.760 --> 29:19.149
I moved evidence because
it needed to be moved.

29:19.240 --> 29:20.832
I'm waiting out front for you.

29:22.920 --> 29:23.920
Oh!

29:24.080 --> 29:26.992
You are getting a roll of
police tape for your birthday.

29:52.400 --> 29:53.799
Here you go.

30:05.640 --> 30:06.640
Get the stuff now.

30:07.800 --> 30:09.392
Meet me in my office.
Five minutes.

30:15.080 --> 30:16.080
Rob. Good to see you.

30:16.160 --> 30:17.229
Stanley.

30:19.800 --> 30:21.028
Hey, how's the old man?

30:21.160 --> 30:22.388
He's good.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.433
Ten.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.513
Here we go again.

30:40.760 --> 30:43.176
Whatever you're looking for, that
lady cop was already in there.

30:43.200 --> 30:44.200
Shit!

30:45.520 --> 30:48.796
What do you mean, she was already in
there, huh? She have a garbage bag?

30:50.360 --> 30:53.079
You don't hear me?
No, huh?

30:53.360 --> 30:54.679
Did she have a...

30:56.200 --> 30:58.270
All right, listen.
Listen.

30:58.360 --> 31:01.033
Listen, I need to
get that garbage bag.

31:01.640 --> 31:02.789
You take this.

31:03.280 --> 31:04.713
It's my father's watch.

31:07.120 --> 31:10.271
I need your help.
Please.

31:12.880 --> 31:14.233
Let's get a drink.

31:14.720 --> 31:17.359
No. No.
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

31:17.440 --> 31:18.998
I just want to
get my stuff and go.

31:19.080 --> 31:23.278
My guy's bringing the stuff to my office.
Just be a few more minutes.

31:29.360 --> 31:30.475
Something wrong?

31:31.400 --> 31:34.039
No. Everything's fine.

31:35.120 --> 31:38.999
I got a great 25-year-old bottle of
Macallan up there with your name on it.

31:39.080 --> 31:40.080
What do you say?

31:43.760 --> 31:46.399
Now, you know
I don't drink.

31:49.800 --> 31:52.360
But sure,
let's go to your office.

32:02.760 --> 32:03.875
Hey.

32:04.480 --> 32:05.549
This is yours.

32:08.440 --> 32:09.475
Thanks.

32:09.920 --> 32:11.399
I'm down.

32:36.920 --> 32:38.239
Stanley,

32:39.120 --> 32:40.519
how much longer?

32:42.640 --> 32:43.914
A few minutes.

32:47.960 --> 32:49.313
A few minutes?

32:54.280 --> 32:55.315
Here's the thing.

32:55.960 --> 33:00.954
You know my family. And we got our
fingers in a whole lot of pies.

33:01.640 --> 33:03.358
I mean, shit,

33:04.280 --> 33:07.875
who doesn't love a hot,
steaming slice of pie?

33:09.280 --> 33:10.315
Delicious.

33:12.200 --> 33:13.349
But my father, he's...

33:14.480 --> 33:15.708
He's a big thinker.

33:17.040 --> 33:18.917
We got a new pie
getting baked up.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.194
Canada.

33:21.160 --> 33:23.879
What can I say?
He likes snow.

33:26.200 --> 33:27.553
Listen, Rob...

33:27.680 --> 33:29.830
No, Stanley, it gets better.

33:30.480 --> 33:32.550
It was supposed to be
a small deal this week.

33:32.680 --> 33:35.353
25 kilos, you know,
just to give them a taste.

33:35.680 --> 33:39.832
Then my idiot cousin decides
to become a DEA informant,

33:40.240 --> 33:42.834
and we lose an entire

33:43.480 --> 33:44.480
shipment.

33:45.960 --> 33:49.111
But me, I step up

33:49.200 --> 33:53.876
and I promise my father
that our Canadian pie is safe,

33:54.760 --> 33:56.512
and that I could
cover the shortage

33:56.840 --> 33:58.512
with an extra

34:01.000 --> 34:02.558
25 kilos.

34:03.680 --> 34:06.592
Your 25 kilos.

34:09.840 --> 34:10.955
I was just trying to help.

34:11.080 --> 34:12.195
No, Stanley.

34:12.920 --> 34:15.992
When you made me the offer,
you were helping me out.

34:16.360 --> 34:19.909
But when I promised my father
that I had it all covered,

34:20.000 --> 34:21.228
then you became obligated.

34:22.880 --> 34:24.154
So,

34:25.040 --> 34:27.679
where is my goddamn cocaine?

34:29.440 --> 34:33.513
Okay. Can you hold one moment, please?
Thank you.

34:33.600 --> 34:35.158
I'd like to rent a locker,
please?

34:35.239 --> 34:37.514
I'm sorry. Lockers are
reserved for spa guests only.

34:37.600 --> 34:38.953
If you'd like to book a...

34:40.400 --> 34:42.197
I'd like to rent a locker,
please.

34:46.760 --> 34:47.795
Thank you.

34:57.560 --> 34:59.755
First floor.

35:12.440 --> 35:13.589
Did you check every monitor?

35:13.760 --> 35:14.909
Yes. I lost him.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.035
God damn it.

35:16.160 --> 35:17.195
We got his kid.

35:17.280 --> 35:18.480
He's gonna bring us our drugs.

35:19.120 --> 35:20.120
Stan...

35:32.600 --> 35:35.398
Hey, I thought you said
you'd meet me outside.

35:35.480 --> 35:36.708
I knew he was dirty.

35:36.840 --> 35:38.114
Where is he?

35:38.800 --> 35:40.358
I stayed with the evidence.

35:40.800 --> 35:42.518
Jesus Christ.

35:42.640 --> 35:44.756
First of all, we got a
dead guy who worked here.

35:44.840 --> 35:46.480
Right? I followed
Downs here and I see him

35:46.640 --> 35:48.232
talking to casino
manager Stan Rubino.

35:48.320 --> 35:50.151
Then Rob Novak
and his guys turn up

35:50.280 --> 35:52.077
and they're meeting with Rubino.

35:52.160 --> 35:54.310
Clearly, this ties in to
our crime scene this morning.

35:54.400 --> 35:57.233
Why, because we've got a police-issued
bullet at the crime scene,

35:57.320 --> 35:59.197
and because Downs comes here

35:59.280 --> 36:02.158
and shoves a ton of cocaine
into the bathroom ceiling?

36:02.800 --> 36:03.835
Then he killed the guy.

36:03.960 --> 36:04.960
Yes.

36:05.720 --> 36:07.039
Okay, he's our guy.

36:08.520 --> 36:09.999
Where'd you put the drugs?

36:10.880 --> 36:12.632
I put them in
a locker in the spa.

36:12.720 --> 36:15.518
Oh, my God.
This is nuts. This is nuts.

36:15.600 --> 36:17.113
We got to get
a judge in on this. No.

36:17.360 --> 36:18.816
If we hang around
waiting for paperwork,

36:18.840 --> 36:20.273
we're gonna miss it.
This is big.

36:20.360 --> 36:22.856
We can bring down the Novaks and have
an internal bust at the same time.

36:22.880 --> 36:24.438
Jennifer...
I'm right about this.

36:24.520 --> 36:25.520
Jen...

36:25.640 --> 36:26.640
I'm fine.

36:28.320 --> 36:30.675
Okay.
What do you want to do?

36:31.080 --> 36:32.559
I want to give Downs a poke.

37:05.560 --> 37:06.788
Shit.

37:08.200 --> 37:09.235
Hey, D.

37:09.320 --> 37:11.151
Do you have him?
Yeah. Got a text from him.

37:11.240 --> 37:13.216
Said he was going to meet some
shorty at the Luxus casino.

37:13.240 --> 37:14.355
What girl?

37:14.480 --> 37:15.680
You know, the...
With the girl.

37:15.720 --> 37:17.153
The girl...
The girl he always with.

37:17.240 --> 37:18.673
The girl...
He doesn't have a girl.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.120
Well, maybe he don't want you
to know who the girl is.

37:21.960 --> 37:23.456
I know you, Vin,
and I know your voice.

37:23.480 --> 37:25.336
And I know you're not telling
me the whole story, are you?

37:25.360 --> 37:26.873
Look, don't start
that right now.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.576
Look, when I get him,
I will call you, okay?

37:28.600 --> 37:30.158
I'll call you when I got him.
Shit.

37:30.240 --> 37:31.673
Look, Vin...

37:39.760 --> 37:40.875
Hey, Downs.

37:40.960 --> 37:42.598
You know what they
say at the airport.

37:42.720 --> 37:44.312
Never leave your bag unattended.

37:44.400 --> 37:45.628
Bryant, I need that bag.

37:45.920 --> 37:46.936
Why don't we meet
up and talk about it.

37:46.960 --> 37:47.960
Fuck you!

37:48.760 --> 37:50.113
Okay.

38:43.480 --> 38:45.311
I gotta get out of here.

38:53.880 --> 38:54.915
Excuse me.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.831
Mr. Rubino has
requested a bottle of Cristal

38:57.000 --> 38:58.797
sent to his office,
immediately.

38:58.880 --> 39:00.080
Put it on his
personal account.

39:00.320 --> 39:01.469
Okay.

39:01.600 --> 39:02.715
To his office, okay?

39:26.680 --> 39:28.716
Nice of you to
finally join us.

39:29.520 --> 39:31.033
What the hell
took you so long?

39:32.040 --> 39:33.314
Who the fuck is this?

39:33.520 --> 39:36.114
This is Vincent Downs.
He's the man who's got your product.

39:36.200 --> 39:38.873
And why have we been sitting
around waiting on you?

39:39.120 --> 39:40.519
There's a lot of
cops downstairs.

39:40.800 --> 39:43.109
Cops all over the casino.
We need to get out of here.

39:43.200 --> 39:45.156
Casino's always full of cops.

39:45.960 --> 39:47.871
They follow you?
Think so.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.956
And, uh, it's narcotics.

39:50.040 --> 39:51.109
They know we're up here.

39:51.240 --> 39:53.310
How do you know
they're narcotics?

39:53.560 --> 39:54.709
'Cause I'm a cop.

39:56.560 --> 39:57.595
Easy.

40:04.080 --> 40:05.911
There something
you want to tell me?

40:07.200 --> 40:08.474
Never a dull moment.

40:10.840 --> 40:13.434
But I didn't know this.
I don't really know what's going on.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
Truly.

40:15.080 --> 40:17.389
Yeah. Now, Stanley,

40:18.400 --> 40:19.549
you never do.

40:22.320 --> 40:24.311
Looking for Mr. Rubino.

40:25.920 --> 40:27.069
I think that's them.

40:27.680 --> 40:29.033
We gotta go.

40:30.080 --> 40:31.718
I'll get you out of here.

40:32.120 --> 40:33.473
Come on.

40:35.600 --> 40:36.919
These stairs
lead to the garage.

40:38.280 --> 40:41.352
Vincent Downs.
I'll remember that.

40:43.120 --> 40:44.519
You should.

40:53.320 --> 40:56.153
Yeah, get the kid. Bring him
down to the front of the club.

40:58.760 --> 41:02.116
Go on, get your son.
Get the fuck out of my casino.

41:09.560 --> 41:10.993
He's waiting on you.

41:22.320 --> 41:25.232
Damn it.
He must still be here.

41:25.320 --> 41:26.440
Did you check with security?

41:26.520 --> 41:27.589
No.

41:27.680 --> 41:29.238
All right, come on.

41:45.200 --> 41:46.349
Stop the fucking car.

41:48.840 --> 41:49.909
It's sugar.

41:51.840 --> 41:53.856
All right, call everyone.
I want everyone here in 10 minutes.

41:53.880 --> 41:56.917
You come with me.
You go to the front. God damn it!

42:07.360 --> 42:08.588
Dad.

42:09.280 --> 42:10.679
Hey, son.

42:13.040 --> 42:14.040
You all right?

42:14.600 --> 42:15.600
Yeah.

42:18.400 --> 42:19.400
It's over.

42:22.040 --> 42:23.359
Let's get out of here.

42:31.200 --> 42:32.200
Hey, Rob.

42:33.480 --> 42:34.480
What did you think?

42:34.800 --> 42:35.936
'Cause you and
my father used to

42:35.960 --> 42:37.016
party together
when you were kids

42:37.040 --> 42:38.075
that I wouldn't kill you?

42:38.200 --> 42:40.475
What's your problem?
I was just trying to help you out.

42:40.560 --> 42:41.560
You needed some product.

42:41.640 --> 42:44.313
You didn't give me product.
You gave me sugar.

42:44.400 --> 42:45.799
What?

42:45.920 --> 42:47.319
Your cop, he fucked you!

42:49.240 --> 42:52.073
Well, I...
I... I have his kid.

42:52.160 --> 42:53.520
He'll bring the drugs.
I'll just...

42:54.200 --> 42:55.758
I'll just...

42:56.360 --> 42:58.555
Just give me some time.

43:02.240 --> 43:03.719
Then what are you waiting for?

43:10.520 --> 43:12.397
Yeah?
Do you still have the kid?

43:12.480 --> 43:14.471
No. I just let him go.

43:14.560 --> 43:15.629
Well, get him back!

43:15.720 --> 43:16.755
Shit!

43:17.280 --> 43:18.679
What's goin' on?

43:18.760 --> 43:19.875
Don't worry about it.

43:19.960 --> 43:21.712
What do you mean,
don't worry about it?

43:25.720 --> 43:27.039
Shit.
Why is he coming back?

43:30.440 --> 43:31.668
Wait, wait, wait.

43:33.280 --> 43:34.429
Yeah.

43:36.720 --> 43:37.914
Come on.
Let's go this way.

43:40.880 --> 43:42.233
Which way?

43:50.480 --> 43:51.595
Fuck!

43:57.720 --> 43:58.835
What? What?

43:58.920 --> 43:59.989
Wait, wait, wait.

44:00.120 --> 44:01.235
What?

44:02.720 --> 44:03.720
Oh, shit!

44:03.800 --> 44:05.950
It's just a cut.
It's just a cut. I'll be okay.

44:06.720 --> 44:08.153
Just give me a minute.

44:12.160 --> 44:13.309
You stole drugs from them?

44:14.160 --> 44:16.120
What you talking about?
That's why you never home.

44:16.160 --> 44:17.275
This your overtime?

44:17.920 --> 44:19.256
Thought you out
doing something good,

44:19.280 --> 44:21.157
and you out here
fucking selling drugs.

44:25.800 --> 44:26.835
It's a case.

44:28.840 --> 44:31.308
Listen, I'm telling you, T,

44:33.320 --> 44:34.435
I'm undercover.

44:35.160 --> 44:38.357
I've been working this case for
two years, and I'm almost...

44:38.440 --> 44:40.296
I almost got it done.
That's why I haven't been around.

44:40.320 --> 44:41.776
That's why I haven't
been able to take you

44:41.800 --> 44:43.199
to your games or
whatever that is.

44:43.280 --> 44:45.077
And I apologize for that.

44:45.520 --> 44:46.794
You're the only one that knows.

44:47.200 --> 44:48.349
Okay?

44:48.440 --> 44:50.670
So you got to stay close,
and we gonna get out of this.

44:51.920 --> 44:53.035
You just gotta trust me.

44:53.160 --> 44:54.195
Yeah.

44:57.360 --> 44:59.430
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on!

45:06.200 --> 45:07.599
Come on, Dad! Come on!

45:08.800 --> 45:09.915
Come on. Get up!

45:11.880 --> 45:13.029
Watch out!

45:14.880 --> 45:16.393
Come on, Dad!

45:48.000 --> 45:49.319
Dad! Dad!

45:49.680 --> 45:51.033
Oh, shit.

46:41.880 --> 46:43.632
Dad. Come on, Dad.

46:46.920 --> 46:48.035
This way.

47:03.080 --> 47:05.548
Yes, sir.
I understand.

47:08.280 --> 47:09.759
I appreciate that.

47:10.840 --> 47:12.273
Yes, sir.

47:24.680 --> 47:26.159
Any sign of him?

47:29.200 --> 47:30.997
I spoke with my father.

47:32.080 --> 47:33.991
We don't have the coke
in the next four hours,

47:34.120 --> 47:36.509
he's cutting his vacation
short and coming home.

47:39.040 --> 47:42.191
I want you to tell
every cop on our payroll

47:43.000 --> 47:45.878
that I will pay to
see Vincent Downs

47:45.960 --> 47:47.871
and his partner
on their knees.

48:33.240 --> 48:34.389
Move!

48:42.880 --> 48:43.960
Get the fuck outta the way!

48:44.040 --> 48:45.040
Come here!

48:45.240 --> 48:46.878
Thomas!
Dad! Dad!

48:48.600 --> 48:50.431
I swear to God,
you little shit,

48:50.840 --> 48:52.717
if you make a scene,
I'll fucking kill you!

48:52.800 --> 48:55.439
Thomas! Move.
Move. Thomas!

48:59.600 --> 49:00.715
Thomas!

49:02.680 --> 49:03.795
Good news.

49:05.200 --> 49:06.235
Got his son back.

49:06.960 --> 49:09.554
I expect this will all be
wrapped up momentarily.

49:13.880 --> 49:15.791
What are you
doing here, Stanley?

49:17.080 --> 49:18.433
You have a job.

49:19.440 --> 49:20.634
A good one.

49:21.600 --> 49:22.715
Yeah.

49:23.640 --> 49:26.393
Looks like you've done
pretty damn well for yourself.

49:31.600 --> 49:33.113
Let me have a water, please.

49:39.400 --> 49:42.517
From what I buy from you
for the clients here, I...

49:43.320 --> 49:45.151
I save a little
back every month.

49:46.000 --> 49:49.629
That 25 kilos
was my safety net.

49:51.080 --> 49:53.275
And why do you
need a safety net?

49:56.840 --> 49:58.990
When you hang
with scumbags,

50:00.240 --> 50:01.389
you need a safety net.

50:02.320 --> 50:03.389
Good answer.

50:12.640 --> 50:13.834
What's that?

50:14.680 --> 50:15.829
Open it.

50:27.040 --> 50:28.837
Is that a...
A tongue?

50:30.200 --> 50:32.031
Yeah.
Jesus.

50:32.120 --> 50:33.155
My cousin's.

50:35.720 --> 50:37.039
So look...

50:39.360 --> 50:40.713
My family...

50:42.360 --> 50:43.634
We have a lot of friends.

50:43.720 --> 50:47.793
So there's gonna be
nowhere that you can go

50:47.880 --> 50:49.871
that we won't be
able to find you.

50:51.200 --> 50:53.395
So I'm giving you
one hour.

50:54.800 --> 50:56.028
One.

51:01.680 --> 51:03.079
Hang on to the box.

51:03.720 --> 51:06.314
I want you to keep it
so it'll remind you

51:06.720 --> 51:09.553
of what happens when people think
that they're smarter than me.

51:27.080 --> 51:30.550
Fuck. Fuck! Fuck!

51:34.720 --> 51:35.720
You get him?
No.

51:35.800 --> 51:36.896
And the product
ain't here either.

51:36.920 --> 51:37.920
Shit.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.560
Just come down and
meet me at the Luxus.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.399
Just get here now.

51:48.560 --> 51:50.118
What the fuck?
Who are you?

51:51.240 --> 51:53.231
Ain't nobody.
Ho. You can't be in here.

51:53.960 --> 51:56.599
Right. You're right.
I'm not even here.

51:56.920 --> 52:00.117
Hmm. Right. Looks official.
You're not coming in here.

52:00.400 --> 52:02.400
Look, you got three options,
either you let me pass

52:02.440 --> 52:04.749
or I'll whup your funny-looking
ass or I can arrest you.

52:07.040 --> 52:08.109
Arrest me...

52:13.800 --> 52:15.028
John Travis.

52:29.640 --> 52:30.880
I'm gonna go
down to the garage,

52:31.000 --> 52:32.216
see if I can find
something in his car.

52:32.240 --> 52:33.800
You should check the front desk.
No. No.

52:33.960 --> 52:35.916
Maybe they saw him.
We're done. We're done.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.616
We have searched
every inch of this casino.

52:37.640 --> 52:40.234
Vincent Downs is long gone.
All right? He beat us.

52:44.320 --> 52:45.320
Are you okay?

52:48.920 --> 52:50.831
You know, a guy gets
beat up on the job,

52:50.920 --> 52:53.992
and everyone congratulates him
on the size of his balls.

52:54.080 --> 52:55.616
But if I get hit,
everyone acts like I need

52:55.640 --> 52:57.600
Scotch tape and a shrink
to get put back together.

52:57.680 --> 52:58.749
No, you know what?

52:58.840 --> 53:01.434
This isn't about this, all right?
It's about your state of mind.

53:01.840 --> 53:04.354
You missed things that
were right in front of you

53:04.440 --> 53:06.874
and you put yourself in the
wrong place at the wrong time

53:06.960 --> 53:08.256
and you almost
got yourself killed.

53:08.280 --> 53:09.918
I'm in the right
place at the right time.

53:10.280 --> 53:13.670
We've got a dirty cop in the middle
of a deal between Rubino and Novak,

53:13.760 --> 53:15.432
and they're
associating in public,

53:15.560 --> 53:17.278
which means they
are not afraid.

53:17.680 --> 53:19.716
Okay.
Someone is protecting them.

53:19.840 --> 53:21.751
Okay. Point taken.

53:21.840 --> 53:25.355
And in the morning,
we will start a formal investigation.

53:25.440 --> 53:28.512
But tonight, I am gonna take
the labs to the precinct

53:28.640 --> 53:32.189
and then I am going
to call it a night.

53:37.560 --> 53:40.711
Fine. I'll take
the drugs into evidence.

53:40.800 --> 53:41.869
Jennifer.

53:43.560 --> 53:44.629
Go home.

53:45.560 --> 53:47.039
Get some sleep.

53:53.800 --> 53:54.949
Fine.

53:57.080 --> 53:58.308
Get some rest, honey.

54:13.080 --> 54:14.274
First floor.

54:14.400 --> 54:15.628
Going up.

54:15.720 --> 54:16.835
I'll wait.

54:28.240 --> 54:29.593
Twenty-seven.
Back off, police!

54:29.720 --> 54:31.119
First floor.

54:32.680 --> 54:35.399
Twenty-seventh floor.

54:41.120 --> 54:42.519
Come on, come on, come on.

54:48.440 --> 54:50.271
Twenty-seventh...

55:36.240 --> 55:38.800
What the fuck are you doin'?
Fuck!

55:40.320 --> 55:42.136
What are you doing?
I'm just trying to get to my son.

55:42.160 --> 55:44.280
You dirty son of a bitch.
Get that fucking gun off me.

56:09.040 --> 56:10.040
Ah!

56:15.360 --> 56:16.873
I knew you were a dirty cop!

56:20.640 --> 56:22.471
You don't get it.
I'm internal affairs.

56:22.560 --> 56:23.834
I know everyone in IA.

56:25.680 --> 56:26.795
You don't know shit.

56:27.200 --> 56:28.616
I know last week
you thought you were

56:28.640 --> 56:29.976
busting a captain
from Bolden Command.

56:30.000 --> 56:31.776
Instead, you ran into a cutter
with a nasty right hook.

56:31.800 --> 56:33.856
Someone takes a dump in my
department, I know about it.

56:33.880 --> 56:35.313
They're shittin' all over it.

56:36.200 --> 56:37.394
I'm off the books.

56:38.160 --> 56:40.833
I've been working undercover for
two years... Two fuckin' years!

56:41.400 --> 56:44.073
You know what that means?
Two fuckin' years!

56:44.200 --> 56:46.216
Ain't seen my wife, my kid!
They don't know about it!

56:46.240 --> 56:48.320
Father of the Year.
Yeah, I'm the Father of the Year.

56:49.200 --> 56:52.078
My partner, Sean Cass,
he is a courier for the Novaks.

56:52.160 --> 56:53.896
He's giving somebody in
the department kickbacks.

56:53.920 --> 56:55.896
Somebody higher up.
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

56:55.920 --> 56:57.114
You're not convincing me.

56:57.240 --> 56:58.600
Then why did your
bust go bad, huh?

56:59.200 --> 57:01.320
You did all the right shit,
all the right police shit,

57:01.400 --> 57:02.515
and it all went bad.
Why?

57:02.600 --> 57:04.176
Because somebody at the
department tipped them off.

57:04.200 --> 57:05.792
I don't believe
a word you fucking say!

57:05.880 --> 57:07.680
Don't have to fuckin'
believe what I'm sayin'.

57:08.080 --> 57:11.436
But you're gonna learn today.
Come on! Get over here!

57:12.080 --> 57:14.310
They got my son, Thomas.
He's 16 years old.

57:14.400 --> 57:15.896
If I don't give 'em the drugs,
they gonna kill him!

57:15.920 --> 57:17.976
Someone kidnapped your son.
Why don't you call for fucking backup?

57:18.000 --> 57:20.195
Because I can't trust anybody!
Where are them drugs?

57:20.280 --> 57:22.111
Fuck you!
I'm gonna kill you, Bryant!

57:22.200 --> 57:24.794
I'll kill you!
Tell me where them drugs are!

57:25.120 --> 57:26.269
Where they at?

57:29.280 --> 57:30.280
Huh?

57:30.960 --> 57:32.552
The women's spa.
Where?

57:34.120 --> 57:37.351
Locker 32,
but I don't have the key.

57:39.280 --> 57:40.429
Fuck!

57:41.560 --> 57:43.391
I'm sorry!
Fuck you!

57:45.040 --> 57:47.474
Fuck. Fuck!

58:29.760 --> 58:32.593
Are you in on this
with your father?

58:32.680 --> 58:35.752
Hey, man, it ain't my fault you
assholes ain't think this through.

58:37.000 --> 58:38.638
Us assholes.

58:40.520 --> 58:41.635
Us assholes?

59:37.560 --> 59:39.198
All right, all right.

59:48.040 --> 59:50.235
Okay. That's it. Okay.

59:53.160 --> 59:54.160
Ah...

59:56.520 --> 59:58.431
Oh-oh-six...

59:59.880 --> 01:00:01.029
Yeah.

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:02.917
Downs is still here!
What?

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.959
He's headed to the locker in the spa.
Go now. Get that motherfucker!

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:08.593
God damn it.

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:10.591
Come on, come on, come on!

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:14.754
I need the key to Locker 32.

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.749
I need the key to Locker 32.

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:26.040
Thank you.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:34.595
Shit!

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:37.359
Freeze! Police!

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:38.919
Hands against the lockers!
Shut up!

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.355
Get your fuckin' hands
against the lockers!

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:43.516
I don't have time for this.
Shut your mouth.

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:45.672
Eyes front.
Shut your mouth.

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:46.954
I know what to do.

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:48.314
Keep your goddamn mouth shut!

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:51.472
Fuck. That's how you do it? Huh?
That's how you do it?

01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:58.239
Oh, my God!

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:12.080
Ah!

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.200
Fuck.

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:29.760
Oh, fuck.

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:55.512
Hey! Dad!

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:57.511
Thomas. Where are you?

01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:59.556
I got away.
Stole this phone.

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:01.432
Look...
Look, you need to wait.

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:04.876
Just tell me where you are.
I'm in this club.

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:07.794
Thomas, I want you to stay right there.
I'm on my way.

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:08.955
Dad, I'm scared.

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.115
I know, I know.

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:12.616
There's a lot of things
I gotta explain to you. I apologize.

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:13.640
Dad?

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:14.760
Thomas?

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:16.631
Dad? Hello?

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:17.869
Thomas?

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:20.950
Shit! Shit.

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:23.039
Fuck. Fuck.

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:34.791
He made a call.
You were right.

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:37.797
I'm only right
if Downs shows up.

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:45.240
SC.

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:47.231
I'm pullin' in.
Yeah, you got a uniform?

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:49.311
Yeah, I got one. Good.
Then meet me in the garage.

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:50.674
I'm on my way.

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:56.830
Yeah, I know. I know.

01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:59.309
Hey, Bryant.

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:02.989
So I got good
news and bad news.

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:04.479
Security?

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:17.835
Damn.
Look like shit, partner.

01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:19.840
I know.
You got the uniform?

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.468
Yeah, uniform in the car.
Front seat.

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:30.998
Tell me you're not
internal affairs.

01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:34.874
Got the gun. Ain't in there.
Give me some answers, you'll get...

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:36.359
What difference does it make?

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:38.838
They got Thomas.
I'm fucked anyway.

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:41.656
We been friends 20 years.
You gonna fuckin' rat on me?

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:43.193
What do you mean,
rat on you?

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:45.640
I got all the information on you
and could've took you down.

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:48.160
I'm protecting you.
You're protecting me?

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:49.792
You internal affairs, nigga!

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:51.616
That's what I'm trying to
make you understand.

01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:55.349
You gotta rock with me. I'll get
Thomas and I'll fix all this shit.

01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:57.268
But you gotta help me.

01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:58.360
Downs!

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:00.474
Put the fucking gun down!

01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:03.514
Shit. Sean! Sean!

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.230
Stay with me!
Sean! Come on!

01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:09.559
Stay with me, Sean.
Stay with me. Shit.

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:11.638
Stay with me.
Look at me. Sean.

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:17.150
Sean! Damn it!

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:20.594
Fuck!

01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:31.720
Let me tell you something.

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:34.280
First thing anybody says when they
go down is, "I'm undercover."

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:35.759
The guy hid
23 kilos of cocaine

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:37.319
in the ceiling
of the bathroom,

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:39.789
he assaulted me
and he tied you up.

01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:41.816
This sound like the actions of
a straight shooter to you?

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:43.671
I agree. Still,
there's something more.

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:46.957
He knew things about me, my case.
Even if he's lying.

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:52.199
We never checked the garage.

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:55.991
What, you... You okay?

01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:57.120
You wanna talk to someone?

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:58.235
Oh, fuck you!

01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:09.278
Hey.
What the hell is going on?

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:10.400
It's all good.

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:12.710
I've been calling
Thomas's phone for an hour.

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:14.200
D, I didn't want
to worry you, okay?

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:15.309
Where are you?

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:16.640
I'm still at the Luxus casino.

01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:20.720
What the fuck is going on, Vin?

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:21.949
Listen.

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:24.196
Everything I do is
about you and him.

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:25.760
You know it's always
been that, right?

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:28.349
I would never let anything
bad happen to either of you.

01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:29.953
Please, you gotta trust me, D.

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:31.075
Baby, you're scaring me.

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:34.431
Yeah. Listen.

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:36.760
I gotta call you right back.

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:37.840
Vin?

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:41.759
What the fuck?

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:53.389
Dena?

01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:57.868
You have one new message.

01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.696
Yeah, it's Dennison.
I have the product.

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:02.597
Stay in the garage.
I'm coming.

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:04.193
Vincent Downs is
internal affairs.

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:05.839
He's five degrees
from fingering us.

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:09.629
You created the mess this morning.
Now you clean it up.

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:11.553
Take Downs out.

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:13.517
Now!
Fuck!

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:18.879
Motherfucker.

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:22.472
Shit, there's another one.

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:39.754
Dennison.

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:40.920
Shh.

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:44.273
It's gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:52.352
Does Vincent Downs
know who I am?

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:55.588
Go fuck yourself.

01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:58.630
Yeah, it's Bryant here.
We've got a 187.

01:07:58.760 --> 01:07:59.909
Parking garage at the Luxus.

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:08.391
How's your guy?
He's gone.

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:12.960
You see any shell
casings over there?

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:14.840
No.

01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:26.238
Mine's dead, too.

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:30.236
It's, uh, Sean Cass.

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:32.313
Vincent Downs's partner.

01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:42.029
You called it in, right?

01:08:43.279 --> 01:08:45.111
Yeah.
Okay. Um...

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:49.960
You stay here with the bodies.
I'm gonna lead 'em in.

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:45.033
You trying to take me down?

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:47.111
Look, you go down,
I go down, all right?

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:49.509
If I go down,
you'll be dead in a week.

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:52.917
Listen.
Got a folder on my desk.

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:54.553
It's got every
name of every cop,

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:56.240
every detail of
every job I did for you.

01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:59.392
Now, if I die,
that folder...

01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:00.674
You,

01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:03.916
your daddy,

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.355
your fuckin' family,

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:08.192
you're done in Vegas.

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:11.158
You can't touch me.

01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:21.635
Yeah.

01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:24.234
But we're paying you a lot
of money to protect us.

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:27.677
And you're not
doing your job.

01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:29.678
Just do your fuckin' job.

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:33.797
Or I think you're gonna
realize there's a lot of ways

01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:35.393
that my family
can touch you.

01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:38.874
We clear?

01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:41.231
First floor.

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:06.758
Look, I have
everything under control.

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:07.840
So do I.

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:14.872
Now, I'm tired of running
around this goddamn casino!

01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:19.111
Where are my fucking drugs?

01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:32.280
Thomas.

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:37.118
Stay right there!
Dad!

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:46.800
The cop's son, we have him.

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:49.312
Yeah, McFerrin's
gonna bring the dope.

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:51.879
Okay.
Okay?

01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:53.435
Please.

01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:00.916
No! No! Stop!

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:34.471
You good?
You okay? You good?

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:38.509
Go!

01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:48.748
Motherfucker!

01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:57.069
Go! Go! Go!
Move!

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:06.109
Get back!

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:09.918
Come on! Come on!
Get those guys!

01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:15.751
Okay. Okay.

01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:19.908
Get back! Get back!

01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:23.714
Hold on.

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:43.589
Get back! Get back!

01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:51.440
Freeze!

01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:57.240
Stanley Rubino,
you're under arrest.

01:13:58.040 --> 01:13:59.296
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:02.278
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:04.040
They're headed to the garage.

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:31.920
Got it.
Well, keep 'em busy.

01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:41.480
All right, meet me downstairs.
Don't let 'em leave the garage.

01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:55.072
I'ma jump out, all right?
What?

01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:56.798
I'ma jump out.

01:14:58.080 --> 01:14:59.680
No matter what happens,
you keep drivin'.

01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:57.880
Oh, shit!

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:07.159
Oh, shit!

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:22.558
Hey, Dad. Dad.
You all right?

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:23.709
All right, get up.

01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:27.475
We gotta go.

01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:28.595
Son.

01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:29.915
Wait, wait.
Oh, shit!

01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:32.634
Wait, wait!

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.115
D!

01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:40.949
D! What the fuck
are you doing here?

01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:45.349
Thomas, are you okay?

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:46.629
He's fine! You stay down!

01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:52.275
Vincent!

01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:55.831
I want my fucking drugs!

01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:57.553
I got 'em!

01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:02.479
Shit!

01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:12.434
Novak!

01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:14.668
Comin' out.

01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:16.056
Don't do that, Dad.
Come on, don't do that!

01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:17.229
I'm comin' out.

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:20.840
I'm comin' out.

01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:25.279
Don't have anything on me.
But I know where the drugs are.

01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:27.429
Okay?

01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:29.360
It's been a fucked-up
day, I know it.

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:31.235
I can take you there.

01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:33.750
Get the drugs and
have it all solved.

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:40.349
Vincent Downs.

01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:45.156
I told you I was
gonna remember that name.

01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:51.634
Dad! Dad. Dad, Dad.

01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:53.073
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:54.593
We're here.

01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:55.856
T, put pressure here and here.

01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:56.915
Where? Here?

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.856
Okay. Got it. I got you, Dad.
Yeah. I'll be right back.

01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:00.256
Hang in there!
Hurry up, Mom. Hurry up!

01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:01.349
Be right back!
Shit.

01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:04.469
Come on, Dad.
We gotta get outta here. All right?

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:05.800
You're gonna be all right.

01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:07.435
Hang in there.

01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:42.310
All right,
everybody, stay back.

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:52.896
All right, Thomas, there's
another towel in the back, okay?

01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:53.955
What?

01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:55.216
There's another
towel back there!

01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:56.240
Get it.

01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:57.616
All right.
Put it on your dad, okay.

01:21:57.640 --> 01:21:59.312
Okay. Got it.
Steady. Hold it steady.

01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:00.799
Got it. I got it.
Steady, Thomas.

01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:01.920
Give me the phone.

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:04.512
Give me the phone.
A phone, phone.

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:05.953
Stay with me, Vin.

01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:07.513
Okay. All right. Got it.

01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:08.760
This ain't yours.

01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:10.433
It's Cass's.

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:12.912
Put it on voicemail.
Okay.

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:26.440
What a night.

01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:29.830
Yeah. What a night.

01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:38.476
- Hello.
- Bryant, don't hang up.

01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:39.709
Just listen.

01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:41.279
Okay? Just listen.

01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:44.776
Yeah, it's Dennison.

01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:47.439
I have the product.
Stay in the garage. I'm coming.

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:49.033
Vincent Downs is
internal affairs.

01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:50.997
He's five degrees
from fingering us.

01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:54.749
You created the mess this morning.
Now you clean it up.

01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:57.513
Take Downs out. Now!

01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:20.360
Freeze!

01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:27.914
Keep driving.

01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:32.795
It's okay.

01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:35.919
Don't worry.
I work for the Novaks.

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:42.509
Novak ever mention my name?

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:45.120
No.

01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:47.238
No? Good.

01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:48.679
Wait! No!

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:50.520
Keep driving.

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:06.359
Requesting immediate help.

01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:32.753
444, officer needs assistance.

01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:37.075
Got movement.

01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:40.079
Easy now. Be careful.

01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:43.318
444, reporting my location.

01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:47.753
Rubino.

01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:50.953
He went crazy.
Grabbed my gun.

01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:54.911
Started shooting everybody.
I think I got him.

01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:56.993
But Bryant didn't make it.

01:24:58.600 --> 01:24:59.635
What the fuck?

01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:17.436
Arrest that fucker!

01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:24.840
Shit.

01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:37.033
Pressure is 160 over 90.
Heart rate is 110.

01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:39.190
Pulse ox, 92.
Actually, 15 liters.

01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:40.639
IV established. TKO.

01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:42.233
Got it.
ETA, nine minutes.

01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:48.834
You all right?

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:52.149
It's okay.
Stay here, Thomas.

01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:10.320
Hold on to this, okay?

01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:13.595
He's gonna be all right.

01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:35.714
BP is thready. Looks like
she's losing consciousness.

01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:38.274
Five's clear.

01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:39.674
Come on, hon.
Stay with me.

01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:41.792
Hard right.
Door.

01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:44.472
Respiratory shallow.
What we got?

01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:46.835
Listen to my voice, hon.
We're almost there.

01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:48.399
Stay with us.
Come on.

01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:18.911
Hey, Mom.
Hey.

01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:24.469
So...

01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:26.549
Hey, you good?

01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:35.794
Sorry.

01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:49.988
What happened to your face?

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:52.953
What happened to your face?

01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:58.831
I think you kicked
the hornet's nest today.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.194
Yeah, we did that.

01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:04.868
Bryant.

01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:08.594
I'm a good cop.

01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:11.949
I know.

01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:19.111
So, about the ring.

01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:27.719
Coordinate with DEA on-site.

01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:00.153
Mr. Novak,
it's Anderson, sir.

01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:04.999
We've got a problem.
