So...

00:21.600 --> 00:25.600
Officers involved in shootings
often bring up feelings of remorse,

00:25.900 --> 00:27.300
and or guilt,

00:27.500 --> 00:29.500
even if the officer's life was threatened.

00:30.200 --> 00:33.300
How have you been feeling since
the attack? Any nightmares?

00:33.400 --> 00:34.700
No. I'm fine.

ACCORDING TO MY DOCTOR.

GOING ON IN YOUR LIFE?

YOU'RE ALWAYS SAYING I NEED TO
LISTEN TO OUTSIDE OPINIONS MORE,

02:27.400 --> 02:29.100
AND THE OPINION
OF OUR BEST PSYCHIATRIST

02:29.100 --> 02:30.800

THE CRIME SCENE FOR ONE MINUTE.

HOW OUTNUMBERED YOU ARE.

06:51.900 --> 06:53.200

ON THE WAY.

INTO THE HILLS,

GOING THERE.

07:04.100 --> 07:05.000
THAT WAS
A BIT OF A LET DOWN.

07:05.700 --> 07:08.300
MAYBE THE NEXT ADDRESS
WILL BE A LITTLE MORE EXCITING.

07:09.700 --> 07:10.800
NOW, IF YOU DON'T MIND
MY ASKING,

07:11.200 --> 07:13.900
WHAT MAKES A HOMICIDE
A PRIORITY?

07:13.900 --> 07:17.500

PRIORITIZE MURDERS, ANYWAY?

OF THESE HIGH-PROFILE CASES.

THAN POOR MINORITIES?

NO, SIR.

07:42.300 --> 07:44.600

BECAUSE OF THE MEDIA COVERAGE.

DOES THE LAPD
ALSO HAVE PRIORITY DIVISIONS

11:17.500 --> 11:19.600
THERE WAS A SHOOTING.

11:19.600 --> 11:23.200
I TRIED TO HELP THE VICTIM,
BUT HE DIDN'T MAKE IT.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.200
LOOK, I DON'T WANT MY PARENTS
TO WORRY ABOUT ME,

11:25.200 --> 11:27.300
AND YOU SHOULDN'T BE IN HERE
WHEN THEY'RE OUT THERE.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.900
WOULD SOMEONE MIND
TELLING ME WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:31.500 --> 11:32.800
ROY.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.400
I'M SORRY, MA'AM.
I'M NOT AT LIBERTY TO SAY.

11:35.400 --> 11:38.400
SAY WHAT? THAT SOMEONE
TRIED TO SHOOT MY DAUGHTER?

11:39.500 --> 11:41.000
SO YOU ALREADY KNOW?

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
OF COURSE.
JUST NOT ALL THE DETAILS.

11:45.800 --> 11:48.800
WELL, MA'AM, YOUR DAUGHTER AND
SERGEANT GABRIEL WEREN'T HIT.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.600
ONE OF THE PASSENGERS
WAS KILLED.

11:50.800 --> 11:52.600
THE OTHER ONE'S
GONNA MAKE IT.

11:52.600 --> 11:53.400
KITCHEN'S CLEAR.

11:59.200 --> 12:02.800
SO, AS YOU CAN SEE,
I'M FINE.

12:02.800 --> 12:05.400
NOW, HOW ARE YOU AND DADDY
GETTING ALONG?

12:05.400 --> 12:07.500
I DON'T KNOW.
WHERE'S YOUR RING?

12:09.900 --> 12:13.900
OH, IT'S, UH,
IN MY PURSE IN EVIDENCE.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.200
SORRY.

12:15.700 --> 12:18.900
LOOK, PLEASE DON'T LEAVE
MY PARENTS ALONE OUT THERE,

12:18.900 --> 12:22.200
AND PLEASE DON'T TELL THEM
I GOT SHOT AT.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.500
YOU GOT SHOT AT?

12:23.500 --> 12:26.000
YES, BUT THEY MISSED.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.600
LOOK, NOW WE GOT
THE SWAT DETAIL,

12:27.600 --> 12:29.500
SO EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE FINE.

12:29.500 --> 12:32.100
PLEASE, JUST PLEASE,
LOOK AFTER MY PARENTS.

12:33.700 --> 12:34.500
OKAY.

12:37.100 --> 12:38.100
OKAY.

12:53.700 --> 12:56.400
SO, Y'ALL READY
TO GO TO DINNER?

12:56.400 --> 12:58.900
ROY SAID SOMEONE
WAS TRYING TO KILL YOU.

13:01.400 --> 13:04.100
SORRY, MA'AM.
YOU HAD NO CHOICE, SON.

13:04.100 --> 13:06.200
WE'RE STAYING HERE.

13:06.200 --> 13:08.000
Brenda: NO. NO. NO.
THAT'S NOT NECESSARY.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
HONEY, WE'VE ALREADY
CANCELLED THE HOTEL,

13:10.100 --> 13:13.200
AND ROY'S SENDING A SQUAD CAR
TO PICK UP OUR LUGGAGE.

13:13.200 --> 13:14.100
I'LL COOK SOMETHING.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.700
NO. W-WE'RE GOING OUT
TO DINNER.

13:16.800 --> 13:19.300
HEY, MAYBE WE SHOULD
TAKE IT EASY?
NO.

13:19.300 --> 13:21.000
I'M NOT GONNA LET THIS
RUIN OUR FUN.

13:21.100 --> 13:24.300
JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE
THIS SILLY SWAT DETAIL

13:24.300 --> 13:27.100
DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T
DO WHAT WE WERE PLANNING,

13:27.100 --> 13:29.900
LIKE GOING TO THE BEACH
AND CHINATOWN.

13:29.900 --> 13:32.700
HONEY, THE ONLY SITE
WE'RE HERE TO SEE IS YOU.

13:35.100 --> 13:36.300
OH, ALL RIGHT, THEN.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.500
BUT Y'ALL ARE GONNA
STAY IN MY BEDROOM, OKAY?

13:38.500 --> 13:39.300
Clay: OH, NO.

13:39.700 --> 13:42.200
NO, YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT GOT SHOT AT.

13:42.200 --> 13:44.400
WE'LL SLEEP
ON THE FOLD OUT.

13:44.400 --> 13:46.500
THE ONLY QUESTION IS...

13:47.900 --> 13:49.600
WHERE'S FRITZ GONNA SLEEP?

13:52.000 --> 13:55.400
OH, BUT --
WELL, I -- I --

14:11.600 --> 14:12.800
WE'RE GONNA NEED A BIGGER BOARD.

14:14.800 --> 14:16.700
WE'VE MOVED THAT WRITER SUICIDE
OVER TO HOLLYWOOD DIVISION,

14:16.900 --> 14:19.100
SO YOU ALL ARE ON THIS SHOOTING
FULL TIME NOW.

14:19.100 --> 14:21.100
CHIEF JOHNSON BELIEVES THAT
YOU ARE THE BEST DETECTIVES

14:21.100 --> 14:23.600
IN THE BUILDING,
SO PROVE HER RIGHT.

14:24.500 --> 14:27.000
LIEUTENANT PROVENZA, YOU'RE
IN CHARGE. WHAT DO YOU GOT?

14:27.000 --> 14:27.800
TAO.

14:28.900 --> 14:30.000
UH...

14:31.800 --> 14:34.700
BALLISTICS CONFIRMED
OUR CASINGS ARE .223 ROUNDS.

14:34.800 --> 14:37.700
M16, AR15 -- SOME KIND OF
SERIOUS FIREPOWER.

14:37.700 --> 14:39.000
PROBABLY GANGS.

14:39.400 --> 14:40.200
SANCHEZ.

14:40.200 --> 14:42.400
SANTA FE, MATEO --
THAT'S NOT BIG GANG TERRITORY,

14:42.500 --> 14:44.900
BUT THEY DO TRAVEL, AND SHE'S
TICKED OFF PLENTY OF THEM

14:45.000 --> 14:46.400
OVER THE PAST
COUPLE OF YEARS.

14:46.400 --> 14:48.200
I'VE BEEN ON THE LINE
WITH SPECIAL INVESTIGATORS

14:48.200 --> 14:50.200
AT THE COUNTY LOCKUP
AND THE STATE PRISONS.

14:50.200 --> 14:52.600
NOW, THEY'RE FOLLOWING UP TO SEE
IF ANY OF THEIR SNITCHES

14:52.600 --> 14:54.200
HAVE HEARD ANYTHING
ABOUT A HIT ON A COP.

14:55.900 --> 14:56.600
FLYNN.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.200
Flynn:
WE'RE CHECKING OUT EVERYBODY

15:03.300 --> 15:06.000
THAT CHIEF JOHNSON HAS EITHER
ARRESTED, INVESTIGATED,

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
OR HELPED CONVICT, ALONG WITH
THEIR FRIENDS AND FAMILIES,

15:09.000 --> 15:12.300
STARTING WITH THE MOST RECENT
AND ARE WORKING OUR WAY BACK.

15:13.800 --> 15:17.700
I'M EXPECTING A SIMILAR LIST
FROM ATLANTA.
WHAT ABOUT D.C.?

15:17.700 --> 15:19.400
THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE
THAT HATED HER THERE.

15:19.800 --> 15:21.300
ALREADY CONTACTED THEM.

15:22.900 --> 15:25.400
ALL RIGHT,
SO, IS THAT IT?
NO, SIR.

15:25.400 --> 15:28.700
IN ABOUT 20 MINUTES, WE ARE
INTERVIEWING THE WITNESSES.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.500
OH, HELLO, SERGEANT.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.600
SO, HOW YOU DOING?

15:43.600 --> 15:45.300
I'M A --

15:45.300 --> 15:48.100
I'M KIND OF PISSED
AT BEING SHOT AT,

15:48.100 --> 15:51.700
BUT, UM, HOW ARE YOU?

15:51.700 --> 15:53.000
I'M SO SORRY.

15:53.300 --> 15:55.500
FOR WHAT?
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
I ALMOST GOT YOU KILLED.

15:55.500 --> 15:56.900
OH, FORGET IT, CHIEF.
THAT'S A --

15:56.900 --> 15:58.900
AND I HAVE BEEN
SO MEAN TO YOU.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.600
CHIEF, REALLY, IT'S OKAY.
I-I'M FINE.

16:04.500 --> 16:07.000
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET THIS
OVER WITH, HUH?

16:07.000 --> 16:08.900
HERE YOU GO, CHIEF.

16:08.900 --> 16:11.500
UH, WHO'S GONNA
INTERVIEW WHO?

16:16.800 --> 16:18.100
CALL IT.
TAILS.

16:18.100 --> 16:19.500
HEADS.
COME ON, GABRIEL.

16:29.200 --> 16:31.000
Flynn: <i>SO, CHIEF,</i>
<i>THIS IS A LITTLE AWKWARD.</i>

16:31.000 --> 16:32.800
<i>NO, LIEUTENANT.</i>
<i>GO RIGHT AHEAD.</i>

16:34.300 --> 16:37.400
WHEN DO I GET MY PURSE BACK?
YOUR PURSE.

16:37.400 --> 16:39.600
UM, YOUR PURSE
IS IN EVIDENCE.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.700
OKAY.
SO, DO YOU HAVE ANY LEADS?

16:43.700 --> 16:44.900
ANYONE SEE
THE SHOOTER'S CAR?

16:45.100 --> 16:47.000
WHOA. WHOA. TIME OUT.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.400
I'M MORE INTERESTED RIGHT NOW
IN <i>YOUR</i> RECOLLECTIONS,

16:50.500 --> 16:52.900
STARTING WITH
WHAT ROUTE YOU TOOK.

16:52.900 --> 16:56.700
UH, WE WERE HEADED WEST
ON SANTA FE,

16:56.700 --> 16:59.900
AND CHIEF WANTED TO COME
TO YOUR CRIME SCENE INSTEAD.

17:00.400 --> 17:01.700
I WOULDN'T TAKE HER THERE.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.200
DID YOU SEE
WHERE THE SHOTS CAME FROM?
I FELT IT.

17:04.700 --> 17:08.000
IT WAS COMING FROM MY RIGHT
SIDE, AND IT SOUNDED CLOSE,

17:08.000 --> 17:11.700
BUT, UM, I DIDN'T, UH --
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

17:11.700 --> 17:13.700
NOTHING?

17:13.700 --> 17:15.099
ANYTHING MIGHT HELP.
NO.

17:15.099 --> 17:17.000
AND, I'VE BEEN TRYING,

17:17.000 --> 17:18.400
BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER
SEEING ANYTHING --

17:18.500 --> 17:21.000
NOT A FACE,
NOT A COLOR OF A CAR.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.400
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF THERE WAS A CAR THERE.

17:22.599 --> 17:24.099
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN
PAYING MORE ATTENTION.

17:25.400 --> 17:27.800
I'M SORRY.
IT'S OKAY, SERGEANT.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.400
JUST TAKE IT EASY.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.700
HAVE YOU RECEIVED
ANY DEATH THREATS,

17:33.700 --> 17:36.600
HAD ANY UNUSUAL CONTACT
WITH GANG MEMBERS

17:36.700 --> 17:40.200
OR SUBJECTS
OF A PAST INVESTIGATION?

17:40.200 --> 17:42.600
NO.
WHAT ABOUT YOUR LOVE LIFE?

17:42.600 --> 17:45.100
DATING ANYBODY WHO MIGHT HAVE
AN ANGRY EX-BOYFRIEND?

17:45.600 --> 17:46.700
UH...

17:48.600 --> 17:50.900
NO EX-BOYFRIENDS
THAT I KNOW OF.

17:51.800 --> 17:53.000
BUT YOU ARE DATING SOMEONE?

17:55.300 --> 17:55.700
YEAH.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.500
<i>DOES THIS SOMEBODY</i>
<i>HAVE A NAME?</i>

18:06.400 --> 18:08.100
IRENE DANIELS.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.400
DETECTIVE DANIELS?

18:11.800 --> 18:12.800
WHO KNEW ABOUT THIS?

18:19.600 --> 18:21.200
SAW THEM AT THE MOVIES.

18:22.400 --> 18:26.500
HOW LONG HAVE YOU AND SHE
BEEN, UM, UH...

18:27.200 --> 18:29.200
ABOUT A YEAR NOW,
AND IN THAT TIME,

18:29.200 --> 18:32.000
I HAVEN'T MET ANY OF HER EXES
OR SHE HASN'T MENTIONED ANY.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.600
NOW, CAN WE MOVE ON?

18:33.800 --> 18:35.400
WE WERE PULLING AWAY
FROM A STOP SIGN,

18:35.500 --> 18:38.700
AND I HEARD A LOUD REPORT,
SO I DROPPED DOWN TO THE FLOOR.

18:38.700 --> 18:40.800
AND, HOW MANY SHOTS
DID YOU HEAR?
FIVE.

18:40.800 --> 18:43.200
15, MAYBE 20.

18:44.400 --> 18:46.000
HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO SAY IT?

18:46.000 --> 18:48.300
I HEARD FIVE SHOTS.
I REMEMBER COUNTING FIVE.

18:48.300 --> 18:51.100
I TOLD MYSELF
TO BE SURE TO COUNT.

18:51.100 --> 18:53.000
SEEMED LIKE
IT WENT ON FOREVER.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.500
AND, THERE WERE
SOME OTHER NOISES...

18:54.900 --> 18:56.400
SOME...

18:57.300 --> 18:58.500
SOME SCREAMING.

18:59.900 --> 19:00.400
Flynn: YOU SURE?

19:00.500 --> 19:02.800
LIEUTENANT, I'M POSITIVE.

19:05.200 --> 19:07.800
Taylor: PIERSON'S CAMERAMAN
KEPT ROLLING THE WHOLE TIME.

19:07.800 --> 19:10.500
MA'AM, ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO SEE THIS?

19:10.500 --> 19:12.300
YES. YES, I AM.

19:12.300 --> 19:13.800
BUZZ, PLAY IT, PLEASE.

19:14.700 --> 19:16.100
Gabriel: <i>...PIERSON DIRECT</i>
<i>OUR ROUTE TODAY.</i>

19:16.200 --> 19:17.700
<i>WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO CALL IN</i>
<i>AND ASK HIM IF --</i>

19:25.100 --> 19:27.800
OH.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.500
I COULD HAVE SWORN
IT WAS FIVE.

19:29.500 --> 19:33.400
21 SHOTS WERE FIRED,
LASTING 4.3 SECONDS.

19:35.600 --> 19:38.200
BUZZ, ROLL
THE CRIME-SCENE VIDEO.

19:40.800 --> 19:44.500
NOW, IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THE
SHOTS CAME FROM ONE POSITION --

19:44.500 --> 19:47.700
EITHER STATIONARY,
OR A SLOW-MOVING VEHICLE.

19:47.700 --> 19:51.600
<i>DEPUTY CHIEF JOHNSON</i>
<i>AND SERGEANT GABRIEL</i>
<i>HAVE BLOOD ON THEM...</i>

19:53.000 --> 19:54.400
<i>NONE OF WHICH</i>
<i>APPEARS TO BE THEIRS.</i>

19:54.500 --> 19:57.000
THE CASINGS WE DID FIND
WERE IN ONE AREA,

19:57.600 --> 19:59.300
LIKE THE ASSHOLE WAS WAITING.

20:02.100 --> 20:04.800
<i>HEY, FOLKS, YOU WANT</i>
<i>TO STEP BACK, PLEASE?</i>

20:05.300 --> 20:05.500
<i>IS SHE ALL RIGHT?</i>

20:05.600 --> 20:07.700
<i>SHE'S FINE. SHE'S FINE.</i>

20:13.300 --> 20:15.500
LIEUTENANT PROVENZA,
KEEP ME UPDATED.

20:16.500 --> 20:19.100
AND YOU TWO GO HOME.
TAKE THE REST OF THE WEEK OFF.

20:19.100 --> 20:20.900
I'M SURE YOU BOTH HAVE
SIGNIFICANT OTHERS

20:20.900 --> 20:22.800
WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
RIGHT.

20:29.900 --> 20:31.400
<i>PEOPLE THINK</i>
<i>WE DON'T GET SHOT AT.</i>

20:31.400 --> 20:32.700
<i>BUZZ, GET THE CAR.</i>

20:35.500 --> 20:37.200
YOU TWO WERE LUCKY.

20:37.200 --> 20:39.100
NO.
I DON'T BELIEVE IN LUCK.

20:40.300 --> 20:41.400
YOU KNOW WHAT, LIEUTENANT?

20:41.500 --> 20:43.800
IF I WERE RUNNING
THIS INVESTIGATION,

20:44.800 --> 20:47.800
I'D WANT THE WITNESSES
TO SEE THAT CAR IN PERSON.

20:49.400 --> 20:52.300
YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST THINKING
THE SAME THING.

20:53.100 --> 20:53.900
HMM.

20:58.600 --> 20:59.600
Brenda: LIEUTENANT TAO.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.100
YOO-HOO!

21:11.300 --> 21:13.200
UH, LIEUTENANT TAO,
HOW MANY CASINGS

21:13.200 --> 21:14.800
WERE RECOVERED
AT THE CRIME SCENE?

21:16.600 --> 21:20.700
WE'RE TRYING TO, UM,
JOG THE WITNESSES' MEMORY.

21:21.400 --> 21:23.000
OH. 21 CASINGS.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.600
AND, HOW MANY BULLETS
HIT THE CAR?
WELL, I CAN'T SAY FOR SURE

21:25.600 --> 21:27.600
'CAUSE A COUPLE COULD HAVE
GONE THROUGH THE WINDOWS,

21:27.700 --> 21:30.300
WHICH WOULDN'T LEAVE BULLET
HOLES, BUT I'M COUNTING 17.

21:30.300 --> 21:33.000
17 OR MORE OUT OF 21?

21:33.100 --> 21:35.300
ALL CONCENTRATED
IN THE SAME AREA.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.400
THAT'S PRETTY SOLID
MARKSMANSHIP.

21:37.400 --> 21:39.400
YEAH, BUT HE MISSED.

21:39.400 --> 21:41.500
NO. HE DIDN'T MISS.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.000
I WASN'T HIS TARGET.

21:48.500 --> 21:49.300
: YOU CAN EITHER

21:49.300 --> 21:50.200
SLAP ME ON THE WRIST

21:50.300 --> 21:52.700
ABOUT INSUFFICIENT
NEIGHBORHOOD POLICE PRESENCE,

21:52.700 --> 21:54.900
OR YOU CAN TELL ME YOU'RE TAKING
THAT MONEY OUT OF MY BUDGET.

21:54.900 --> 21:56.100
PICK ONE.

21:56.600 --> 21:59.400
WHEN MIGHT CHIEF POPE HAVE A
MOMENT TO SPEAK WITH ME TODAY?

21:59.400 --> 22:00.500
HEY.

22:00.500 --> 22:02.900
ARE YOU OKAY?
BETTER THAN OKAY.

22:02.900 --> 22:05.100
GREAT. THAT'S GREAT.
WHY?

22:05.100 --> 22:07.200
BECAUSE THE GUY YOU THOUGHT
WAS TRYING TO SHOOT AT ME

22:07.300 --> 22:09.700
WAS ACTUALLY
SHOOTING AT GREG PIERSON.

22:09.700 --> 22:11.500
SO, YOU CAN CALL OFF
THE SWAT TEAM,

22:11.500 --> 22:12.600
AND I CAN GET ON
WITH DOING MY JOB

22:12.600 --> 22:14.100
AND INVESTIGATING
THIS MURDER.

22:14.060 --> 22:15.660
NOT GONNA HAPPEN. BUT WHY?

22:15.690 --> 22:17.100
UNTIL WE HAVE THE SHOOTER IN CUSTODY,

22:17.250 --> 22:18.800
THE SECURITY DETAIL STAYS IN PLACE.

22:18.950 --> 22:21.850
YOU ARE TOO IMPORTANT TO THIS DEPARTMENT.
WELL,I'M FLATTERED,

22:22.000 --> 22:24.810
BUT I CANNOT OPERATE UNDER
THESE CONDITIONS.

22:24.940 --> 22:27.560
MAYBE I SHOULD REMIND YOU THAT YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO BE OPERATING AT ALL

22:27.710 --> 22:30.610
UNTIL YOU ARE CLEARED FOR ACTIVE DUTY
BY DR. LEONARD.

22:30.760 --> 22:33.960
COME ON,WILL. NOBODY HAS TO KNOW.

22:34.110 --> 22:35.300
GOOD. NOBODY HAS TO KNOW. GOOD.

22:35.460 --> 22:37.720
THAT WILL MAKE IT LIKE GABRIEL
AND DANIELS DATING FOR A YEAR.

22:37.870 --> 22:39.490
WELL,IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE PARTNERS.
I DON'T CARE.

22:39.640 --> 22:40.430
THAT'S IMPORTANT ENOUGH

22:40.580 --> 22:42.510
THAT I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED YOU TO
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

22:42.650 --> 22:44.350
LOOK,WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS LATER.

22:44.500 --> 22:46.460
RIGHT NOW YOU NEED TO GO HOME.

22:46.600 --> 22:50.100
IS THAT AN ORDER? YEAH,IF IT HAS TO BE.

22:52.860 --> 22:56.150
GUESS I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW MUCH
I WAS BOTHERING YOU.

22:59.700 --> 23:00.880
CRAP.

23:06.570 --> 23:10.280
ONCE AGAIN,CHAD,I-I DID NOT MEAN TO
HURT YOUR FEELINGS.

23:10.420 --> 23:10.950
IT'S OKAY.

23:11.110 --> 23:13.600
NOW,WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
TELL CHIEF POPE?

23:13.750 --> 23:15.480
THAT WE WENT STRAIGHT HOME.

23:15.630 --> 23:19.590
THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

23:19.800 --> 23:23.620
MR. KIMBLE,HOW ARE YOU FEELING TODAY,SIR?

23:23.800 --> 23:26.780
I REMEMBER PUTTING MY
CAMERA DOWN,AND THAT'S IT.

23:26.920 --> 23:29.380
MR. KIMBLE,WE'RE VERY SORRY
ABOUT YOUR FRIEND.

23:29.530 --> 23:30.780
THANKS.

23:31.390 --> 23:33.380
YOU KNOW,I'VE BEEN DOING THIS
JOB LONG ENOUGH

23:33.540 --> 23:35.750
TO RECOGNIZE THE REAL DEAL.

23:35.910 --> 23:39.100
THIS KID,HE HAD -- HE HAD NETWORK
WRITTEN ALL OVER HIM,

23:39.260 --> 23:43.620
AND I GUESS I KIND OF THOUGHT
HE'D BRING ME WITH HIM.

23:44.800 --> 23:46.730
I WAS WRONG.

23:47.120 --> 23:50.540
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT ALL OF THIS,
JUST SO SORRY.

23:50.700 --> 23:53.910
THANK YOU. IT'S ALL JUST SO UNFAIR.

23:54.040 --> 23:56.300
GREG WAS SUCH A GOOD MAN.

23:56.460 --> 23:57.950
THE WORK HE DID.

23:58.750 --> 24:01.390
YOU'RE PULLING A PIERSON.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.130
EXCUSE ME?

24:02.180 --> 24:04.840
YOU KNOW,KISS ASS AND LIE TO
YOUR SUBJECT

24:04.980 --> 24:06.620
TILL THEY TELL YOU THE STORY YOU WANT.

24:06.770 --> 24:09.580
I WASN'T TRYING TO
-- I WORKED WITH GREG.

24:09.720 --> 24:13.480
I'VE SEEN THE TECHNIQUE ENOUGH
TO RECOGNIZE IT.

24:14.240 --> 24:16.300
YOU'RE SAYING GREG LIED TO PEOPLE?

24:16.450 --> 24:19.510
WHO DID HE LIE TO? EVERYBODY.

24:19.670 --> 24:22.470
HE LIED TO YOU GUYS. HE DID?

24:22.620 --> 24:26.500
GREG WASN'T DOING A FEATURE ON
THE OVERBURDENED LAPD.

24:26.630 --> 24:29.760
HE WAS ABOUT TO EXPOSE HOW
INCOMPETENT YOU ARE.

24:29.900 --> 24:31.920
REALLY? WE'RE INCOMPETENT?

24:31.990 --> 24:34.850
WELL,THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF
FUGITIVES IN L.A.

24:34.990 --> 24:36.660
WHO YOU GUYS SAY YOU CAN'T CATCH.

24:36.800 --> 24:41.020
GREG DID SOME BASIC RESEARCH,
FOLLOWED UP A FEW SIMPLE TIPS,

24:41.170 --> 24:42.400
AND FOUND A BUNCH OF THEM.

24:42.540 --> 24:45.230
ONE OF THEM CRASHED AT THOSE
TWO ADDRESSES HE GAVE YOU.

24:45.390 --> 24:47.770
SO,WHILE WE THOUGHT GREG WAS
ACTUALLY HELPING US OUT,

24:47.930 --> 24:49.820
HE WAS SETTING US UP TO LOOK LIKE IDIOTS.

24:49.980 --> 24:52.180
THAT IS <i>NOT</i> COOL.

24:52.340 --> 24:55.000
WELL, LIKE GREG USED TO SAY,

24:55.430 --> 24:57.640
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO LIE
TO TELL THE TRUTH.

24:57.780 --> 25:01.580
WELL,IN MY EXPERIENCE,MOST PEOPLE
DON'T LIKE BEING LIED TO.

25:01.740 --> 25:03.460
WHAT WAS THIS FUGITIVE'S NAME?

25:03.610 --> 25:04.980
I DON'T KNOW.

25:05.140 --> 25:06.230
ALL RIGHT,UH, SERGEANT GABRIEL,

25:06.380 --> 25:07.900

25:08.060 --> 25:09.590
LOOK INTO THOSE TWO ADDRESSES?

25:09.730 --> 25:12.760

TURNS UP.

25:12.910 --> 25:14.410
AND,MR. KIMBLE,

25:14.560 --> 25:16.310
IF YOU COULD GIVE ME SOME
BACKGROUND INFORMATION

25:16.470 --> 25:19.290
ON ANYONE ELSE WHO MIGHT
HAVE HAD A "PIERSON" PULLED ON THEM,

25:19.420 --> 25:22.540
I WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE IT.

25:48.010 --> 25:49.590
NO. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

25:49.830 --> 25:52.740
ROY AND I HAVEN'T REALLY HAD
MUCH OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHAT.

25:52.900 --> 25:55.900
SOME OF HIS DOGS HAVE BEEN
TRAINED TO SMELL DRUGS.

25:56.040 --> 25:57.720
Roy: JUST ONE -- KLAUS.

25:57.880 --> 25:58.790

MY MOM'S GONNA BE BUMMED
WHEN SHE HEARS THIS GUY DIED.

26:17.550 --> 26:18.800
SHE LOVED HIM.

26:18.950 --> 26:21.210
SUCH A NICE-LOOKING YOUNG MAN.

26:21.370 --> 26:23.450
HE'S THE FIRST GUY I'VE COME ACROSS

26:23.610 --> 26:26.840

26:42.610 --> 26:45.550
HIS CAMERAMAN SAID HE WAS
FOLLOWING UP ON SOME TIPS.
