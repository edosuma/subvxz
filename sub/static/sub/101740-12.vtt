WEBVTT

01:01.931 --> 01:03.454
Nico.

01:03.498 --> 01:05.456
Okay, <i>mira.</i>

02:04.080 --> 02:07.214
All right, go.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.934
-Hello?

03:15.978 --> 03:17.849
Hey, boss.

03:17.893 --> 03:19.242
How you doing, McGee?

03:19.286 --> 03:22.289
I'm good. Hey, Lucy.

03:22.332 --> 03:23.594
I hope you don't mind me,
uh, dropping by.

03:23.638 --> 03:25.248
I was on the way to work.
Thought I'd...

03:25.292 --> 03:26.467
drop off your mail.

03:26.510 --> 03:27.946
You didn't have to
make the trip.

03:27.990 --> 03:30.253
Oh, it's on the way.

03:30.297 --> 03:32.908
Hey, the-the boat's
looking great.

03:32.951 --> 03:35.824
Yeah. Finally starting to look
like something.

03:35.867 --> 03:37.608
Mm.

03:37.652 --> 03:41.090
Hey, so I, uh, I talked to Vance
about your suspension.

03:41.133 --> 03:42.918
That article that was
written about you?

03:42.961 --> 03:45.181
Turns out it's gonna
be a big help to us.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.965
See, by coming clean
about the suspension,

03:47.009 --> 03:48.750
NCIS proved that
they're not afraid

03:48.793 --> 03:50.360
to clean their house a
little bit, all right?

03:50.404 --> 03:53.407
So... so Vance said
once things calm down,

03:53.450 --> 03:54.930
there's a chance you
could come back soon.

03:54.973 --> 03:56.453
Nah, that's not up to me.

03:56.497 --> 03:58.412
Well, either way, I mean,
it's a good thing, right?

03:58.455 --> 04:00.152
You've been stuck at
home for three weeks.

04:00.196 --> 04:01.632
Must be climbing
the walls by now.

04:01.676 --> 04:02.677
Eh, I don't know.

04:02.720 --> 04:05.157
Not really.
Put off a lot of things.

04:05.201 --> 04:07.116
Now I got time
to get them done.

04:11.338 --> 04:13.209
Boss, don't you miss it?

04:14.645 --> 04:15.820
The job?

04:15.864 --> 04:18.345
More to life than a job, McGee.

04:23.828 --> 04:25.743
Oh, a body in Reston.

04:25.787 --> 04:28.268
Normally this is when you'd say,
"Grab your gear."

04:28.311 --> 04:30.095
Yeah.

04:30.139 --> 04:32.010
Eh, not this time.

04:32.054 --> 04:34.317
Good to see you, boss.

04:34.361 --> 04:35.971
Yeah.

04:36.014 --> 04:37.712
See you, McGee.

04:42.369 --> 04:44.458
<i>This is a disaster.</i>

04:44.501 --> 04:46.503
The house
just went on the market.

04:46.547 --> 04:48.113
And you found the body when?

04:48.157 --> 04:50.246
I came at 8:00 this morning
to prep for my open house.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.292
I'm famous for my open houses.

04:52.335 --> 04:55.295
I put on a cheese spread
to die for.

04:55.338 --> 04:57.993
Which is a terrible thing
to say now,

04:58.036 --> 04:59.734
given the circumstances.

04:59.777 --> 05:02.127
And the house was locked
when you arrived?

05:02.171 --> 05:03.694
Of course. I always
lock it when I leave.

05:03.738 --> 05:06.393
Although, this
is a great neighborhood.

05:06.436 --> 05:08.482
No crime, fabulous schools.

05:08.525 --> 05:09.787
Do you have
any children, honey?

05:09.831 --> 05:11.572
-Are you in the market?
-Where we at?

05:11.615 --> 05:14.662
Uh, in the bathroom
with Bishop.

05:14.705 --> 05:16.403
Such a shame.

05:16.446 --> 05:18.840
Who's gonna
buy this place now?

05:18.883 --> 05:21.364
-Hi.
-Hey.

05:21.408 --> 05:23.235
-Morning, McGee.
-Morning.

05:23.279 --> 05:25.368
-That's, uh, quite a mess.
-Yeah.

05:25.412 --> 05:28.153
There's, uh, there's more
of it out in the hallway.

05:28.197 --> 05:29.241
Hey, how's Gibbs?

05:29.285 --> 05:30.808
Uh, I'm not sure.

05:30.852 --> 05:33.245
He said, "There's more to life
than the job."

05:33.289 --> 05:35.247
-Gibbs said that?
-Yeah.

05:35.291 --> 05:36.727
Like <i>Invasion
of the Body Snatchers.</i>

05:36.771 --> 05:39.643
Yeah. I can't remember the
last time he took a vacation.

05:39.687 --> 05:42.646
Or a sick day, for that matter.
He can't not work.

05:42.690 --> 05:43.995
You'd think.

05:44.039 --> 05:45.736
-Huh.
-So, who's our victim?

05:45.780 --> 05:49.566
Uh, this is Marine Staff
Sergeant Richard Larson.

05:49.610 --> 05:52.264
Jimmy's, uh, not here yet,
but I'd say by the looks of him,

05:52.308 --> 05:54.789
he has been stabbed
multiple times.

05:54.832 --> 05:56.007
Find a murder weapon?

05:56.051 --> 05:59.663
No, but I did find this
near the sink.

05:59.707 --> 06:02.405
It's a hair-- a little bit
lighter than our victim's.

06:02.449 --> 06:04.538
So, might have caught a break.

06:04.581 --> 06:07.062
Hey, yo. Any of you
have a hundred grand

06:07.105 --> 06:08.455
I can borrow for a down payment?

06:08.498 --> 06:10.892
Why, is Jeri Fleckman
giving you the hard sell?

06:10.935 --> 06:12.241
You have no idea.

06:12.284 --> 06:13.460
I gave her your number.
Expect a call.

06:13.503 --> 06:16.158
Nick, any chance our victim

06:16.201 --> 06:17.507
worked with
your real estate agent?

06:17.551 --> 06:19.335
No, no. She's never
seen him before.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.468
Then why does he have a key?

06:25.167 --> 06:26.516
What's the
word, Jimmy?

06:26.560 --> 06:28.039
How about "impatient," Nick?

06:28.083 --> 06:30.607
As in, "Stop being so impatient,
I haven't finished yet."

06:30.651 --> 06:33.349
I know, I know. I figured I'd
come down and bug you anyways.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.698
What's the cause of death?

06:34.742 --> 06:36.744
Massive bleeding
due to multiple stab wounds

06:36.787 --> 06:38.485
here in his abdomen,
his left lung,

06:38.528 --> 06:41.313
carotid artery.
I count seven in total.

06:41.357 --> 06:42.402
Damn, that's a lot of stabbing.

06:42.445 --> 06:43.664
Yeah, and based on the wounds,

06:43.707 --> 06:45.883
I'd say the blade
was about 15 inches long,

06:45.927 --> 06:47.798
very thin, double-edged.

06:47.842 --> 06:49.626
Could be a facon.

06:49.670 --> 06:53.456
It's a South American knife, uh,
originally used by the gauchos.

06:53.500 --> 06:56.503
It's long and thin
and it can cause major damage.

06:56.546 --> 06:58.461
Oh, is-is it like, uh, like
that restaurant you took me to

06:58.505 --> 07:00.811
where the waiters-- they cut
the meat with the swords?

07:00.855 --> 07:02.639
No, Jimmy.
It's nothing like those.

07:02.683 --> 07:05.294
Oh. That was fun, though.
We should do that again.

07:06.338 --> 07:07.992
Hey, Kasie. Any luck

07:08.036 --> 07:09.820
with that strand of hair
we found?

07:09.864 --> 07:12.388
Uh, that's actually
why I came down here.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.999
So, I ran the DNA
and, unfortunately,

07:15.043 --> 07:18.916
whoever the hair belongs to
isn't in our database.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.483
But someone else came up

07:20.527 --> 07:23.660
-as a close familial match.
Mm.

07:23.704 --> 07:25.314
You mean, like a,
like a relative?

07:25.357 --> 07:26.489
Well, that's
great news, right?

07:26.533 --> 07:27.534
We just track down
the relative,

07:27.577 --> 07:28.926
they take us
to the murderer,

07:28.970 --> 07:30.493
and then we can
Golden State Killer this puppy.

07:30.537 --> 07:31.799
Who's the relative?

07:32.800 --> 07:34.758
You, Nick.

07:45.769 --> 07:48.032
That hair from the crime scene--

07:48.076 --> 07:51.514
I ran the DNA, and it belongs
to one of Torres' relatives.

07:51.558 --> 07:54.604
What?
Do we know which one?

07:54.648 --> 07:55.997
The DNA is too corrupted.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.042
All I can tell you
is that it's a male.

07:58.086 --> 08:00.567
This is crazy.
It's got to be a mistake.

08:00.610 --> 08:01.698
DNA don't lie.

08:01.742 --> 08:04.527
I mean, I have black sheep
in the family.

08:04.571 --> 08:07.138
I mean, who doesn't?
But a murderer?

08:07.182 --> 08:08.749
Okay, well, no one
is saying that, Nick.

08:08.792 --> 08:10.533
Right now he's just
a person of interest.

08:10.577 --> 08:12.013
Could the hair
belong to your father?

08:12.056 --> 08:14.537
No, no. Last I heard,
he was dead.

08:14.581 --> 08:16.670
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

08:16.713 --> 08:18.019
No, it's all good.

08:18.062 --> 08:19.499
He was a deadbeat.

08:19.542 --> 08:21.675
He walked out on me
when I was five.

08:21.718 --> 08:23.285
Other than, uh,

08:23.328 --> 08:26.157
Lucia and Amanda, do you have
any other family in town?

08:26.201 --> 08:28.116
I mean, I have tons of cousins
I haven't spoken to in years.

08:28.159 --> 08:30.118
I can track them down.
It's gonna take a while.

08:30.161 --> 08:32.250
All right, well, what do we know
about the victim?

08:32.294 --> 08:33.991
Uh, let me put it up.

08:34.035 --> 08:37.604
Okay, Marine Staff Sergeant
Richard Larson, 36.

08:37.647 --> 08:39.127
Married,
two kids.

08:39.170 --> 08:41.564
I spoke to the realty company,
and it turns out

08:41.608 --> 08:44.306
they did have
a connection to Larson.

08:44.349 --> 08:45.699
He was moonlighting as a mover

08:45.742 --> 08:48.049
for the decorator
that stages the homes.

08:48.092 --> 08:49.529
Well, that explains
why he had a key.

08:49.572 --> 08:51.574
Look at Larson's
bank records here.

08:51.618 --> 08:53.576
An hour before he was
killed, he withdrew

08:53.620 --> 08:55.622
-$5,000.
He definitely didn't

08:55.665 --> 08:57.058
have that money
when we found him.

08:57.101 --> 08:58.189
So what happened to it?

09:58.554 --> 10:00.121
Ciao.

10:00.164 --> 10:03.951
So, Javier, uh, was on
a trip to Miami on business.

10:03.994 --> 10:05.648
All right, that is a "no"
for Javier.

10:05.692 --> 10:07.519
What about his brother,
uh, Gustavo?

10:07.563 --> 10:08.912
Married with kids in Bogotá.

10:08.956 --> 10:10.740
-Hey. Any luck?
No, none of my relatives

10:10.784 --> 10:12.742
were in D.C. at the
time of the murder.

10:12.786 --> 10:14.483
But we still have
your Aunt Isabella's

10:14.526 --> 10:17.007
side of the family to cover.
And don't forget Uncle Ramón's.

10:17.051 --> 10:19.183
Honestly, I don't know how many
more of these calls I can make.

10:19.227 --> 10:21.316
-Draining, huh?
-Yeah, man,
they're playing catch-up

10:21.359 --> 10:23.057
over and over and over again,
and the endless

10:23.100 --> 10:24.885
guilt trips and
"why am I not calling more?"

10:24.928 --> 10:26.713
I actually think
it's kind of fun, you know.

10:26.756 --> 10:29.629
I really, really like
tracing family histories.

10:29.672 --> 10:31.326
Think I got something.

10:31.369 --> 10:33.023
That, uh, doorbell camera
footage, taken from

10:33.067 --> 10:34.677
the house across the street
from the crime scene.

10:34.721 --> 10:36.810
The same car drove
past repeatedly

10:36.853 --> 10:38.681
-the day of the murder.
-Any plates?

10:38.725 --> 10:39.987
Just got the last three digits.

10:40.030 --> 10:41.684
But the windshield's
got a crack in it,

10:41.728 --> 10:42.859
so I put a BOLO out.

10:42.903 --> 10:44.252
Good luck finding that car.

10:44.295 --> 10:46.123
Needle, meet haystack.

10:47.342 --> 10:48.604
They just found it, didn't they?

10:48.648 --> 10:50.301
Yeah?

10:51.825 --> 10:53.261
Great, thanks.

10:53.304 --> 10:56.046
Jeep is parked
outside a hotel in the city.

11:00.268 --> 11:02.705
-That's the car.
Looks like a rental.

11:02.749 --> 11:04.098
Talk to the manager.
See if we can get

11:04.141 --> 11:06.143
-a name and room number.
-Yeah.

11:13.150 --> 11:14.369
-Thank you.
-Yep.

11:14.412 --> 11:16.023
No problem.

11:24.205 --> 11:25.815
Excuse me.

11:27.469 --> 11:29.601
Sir!

11:32.082 --> 11:33.344
S...

11:34.519 --> 11:36.217
Nick! He's running!

11:38.175 --> 11:39.220
Stop!

11:46.880 --> 11:48.708
NCIS! Freeze!

11:50.318 --> 11:52.102
Ah...

12:01.285 --> 12:02.852
Nicolito.

12:28.138 --> 12:30.010
Hey.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.797
How you holding up?

12:36.190 --> 12:39.062
Well, he's taller
than I remember.

12:40.847 --> 12:42.674
Where's Nico?

12:42.718 --> 12:44.198
I want to speak to my son.

12:44.241 --> 12:45.677
Please sit down,
Mr. Torres.

12:45.721 --> 12:47.810
No, I don't like sitting.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.726
Sit down.

12:51.858 --> 12:53.816
It says here you
are Miguel Torres

12:53.860 --> 12:55.905
from the Republic
of Panama, yes?

12:55.949 --> 12:57.341
That's right.

12:57.385 --> 12:59.779
What are you doing here
in D.C., Mr. Torres?

13:00.954 --> 13:02.782
Visiting family, tourist stuff.

13:02.825 --> 13:06.655
"Stuff" that includes
running from federal agents?

13:06.698 --> 13:08.700
I didn't know
you were an agent.

13:08.744 --> 13:10.137
Where I come from,

13:10.180 --> 13:12.400
someone comes at you with a gun,

13:12.443 --> 13:13.967
it usually ends badly.

13:14.010 --> 13:16.491
You know what this is?

13:16.534 --> 13:19.276
Mm. Facon.

13:19.320 --> 13:20.277
Do you own one?

13:20.321 --> 13:21.191
Yeah.

13:21.235 --> 13:23.541
But so do millions of others.

13:23.585 --> 13:26.718
Have you seen this man before?

13:26.762 --> 13:27.850
No.

13:27.894 --> 13:29.286
He was stabbed multiple times

13:29.330 --> 13:31.158
with what we believe
is a facon.

13:31.201 --> 13:34.465
Mm. And because
I'm South American,

13:34.509 --> 13:36.032
I must have done it.

13:36.076 --> 13:38.556
No, it's because we found
your hair next to his dead body.

13:38.600 --> 13:41.385
Where was he killed?

13:41.429 --> 13:43.300
Open house in Reston.

13:43.344 --> 13:44.519
Yeah, I was there.

13:44.562 --> 13:46.521
Sunday morning.

13:46.564 --> 13:48.479
I checked it out,

13:48.523 --> 13:50.351
used the bathroom.

13:50.394 --> 13:53.049
That's probably
why my hair was there.

13:53.093 --> 13:54.485
What were you doing
at the open house

13:54.529 --> 13:55.878
-to begin with?
-I told you.

13:55.922 --> 13:58.925
I was looking at house prices.

13:58.968 --> 14:01.971
My family lives in,
uh, D.C. area

14:02.015 --> 14:04.017
and I'm thinking
about moving here

14:04.060 --> 14:06.019
to be nearer to them.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.195
That's interesting,

14:08.238 --> 14:11.415
considering your own son
thought you were dead.

14:17.204 --> 14:19.728
Really, is this
all you have on me?

14:19.771 --> 14:21.730
My hair at a public place

14:21.773 --> 14:24.167
and a knife
that anyone could owned?

14:24.211 --> 14:27.518
I mean,
I'm just a tourist,

14:27.562 --> 14:28.998
but I'm pretty sure

14:29.042 --> 14:31.348
that you can't
arrest someone for murder

14:31.392 --> 14:33.220
without proof.

14:33.263 --> 14:35.265
Now, I want to see to my son.
Nico!

14:35.309 --> 14:37.267
We're not finished here,
Mr. Torres.

14:37.311 --> 14:38.747
Please. Nico!
Mr. Torres.

14:38.790 --> 14:40.314
-We're not done here.
-Nico!

14:41.968 --> 14:44.622
This isn't over.

14:46.581 --> 14:48.104
What do you think?

14:49.453 --> 14:51.064
He's lying.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.240
How do you know?

14:56.983 --> 14:58.810
Because his lips are moving.

15:01.465 --> 15:02.814
Nico...

15:03.598 --> 15:05.252
<i>You're not gonna charge him?</i>

15:05.295 --> 15:07.428
He's right. Everything we have
on him is circumstantial.

15:07.471 --> 15:09.430
We can hold him
for 24 hours,

15:09.473 --> 15:12.128
but then we're gonna
have to cut him loose.

15:12.172 --> 15:14.348
You were too easy on him.
I should have gone in.

15:14.391 --> 15:16.306
Nick, come on.
It's a conflict of interest.

15:16.350 --> 15:17.829
You knew that
wasn't gonna happen.

15:17.873 --> 15:19.266
Well, maybe it should have.

15:19.309 --> 15:20.702
Look, I understand this
is difficult for you.

15:20.745 --> 15:22.095
But you're too emotional
right now.

15:22.138 --> 15:23.444
Oh, I'm too emotional?
No, I'm doing my job.

15:23.487 --> 15:25.098
He lied about
why he was in the States.

15:25.141 --> 15:26.708
He lied about
not knowing Larson,

15:26.751 --> 15:28.101
he barely looked at the picture.

15:28.144 --> 15:30.059
I'm telling you,
he's guilty

15:30.103 --> 15:31.495
and I know it.

15:31.539 --> 15:32.975
Okay, maybe so, but that
doesn't change the fact

15:33.019 --> 15:34.455
that we still need
more evidence.

15:34.498 --> 15:36.936
Listen, if your
father is guilty,

15:36.979 --> 15:38.502
we have 24 hours
to prove it.

15:41.505 --> 15:43.855
I'll talk to him.

15:43.899 --> 15:45.988
Hey. Nick.

15:48.469 --> 15:49.600
There you go.

15:49.644 --> 15:50.993
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

15:55.302 --> 15:58.348
You two really got to
stop meeting like this.

15:59.915 --> 16:01.351
Want a menu?

16:01.395 --> 16:04.224
Uh, no. No, thanks, Elaine.
Cup of coffee.

16:04.267 --> 16:06.574
Hey, and a slice
of that pie,

16:06.617 --> 16:07.879
if you got any.

16:07.923 --> 16:09.055
Mm-hmm.

16:09.098 --> 16:10.621
Well, well, well.

16:10.665 --> 16:12.145
What a surprise.

16:12.188 --> 16:13.842
What are you doing here?

16:13.885 --> 16:15.061
I could ask you
the same question.

16:15.104 --> 16:16.888
If this about the article

16:16.932 --> 16:18.151
and you're looking
for a retraction,

16:18.194 --> 16:19.369
you can forget about it.

16:19.413 --> 16:22.503
No.
No, you did good work on it.

16:22.546 --> 16:23.852
Did good work

16:23.895 --> 16:25.158
on all your articles.

16:27.725 --> 16:29.510
Working on anything new?

16:31.033 --> 16:32.861
Maybe.

16:32.904 --> 16:34.123
Why?

16:34.167 --> 16:36.082
I'm just curious.

16:39.911 --> 16:41.696
I don't buy it.

16:41.739 --> 16:43.350
I think
you're bored.

16:43.393 --> 16:47.006
I've seen that look on a lot
of cops who've just retired.

16:48.224 --> 16:50.879
-You don't have enough to do.
-Hey,

16:50.922 --> 16:53.273
I just came here for the pie.

16:54.796 --> 16:56.189
Sure.

16:56.232 --> 16:58.930
See you around, Agent Gibbs.

17:04.110 --> 17:07.765
<i>You talk to your mom and sister
about your dad yet?</i>

17:07.809 --> 17:09.550
Nope.

17:09.593 --> 17:11.900
Still trying to figure out
how to break it to them.

17:11.943 --> 17:13.510
That he's alive?

17:13.554 --> 17:15.686
That he's a murderer.

17:17.253 --> 17:19.995
Nick, I know you're not
gonna want to hear this...

17:20.039 --> 17:21.388
Then don't say it.

17:21.431 --> 17:23.085
But McGee
is right.

17:23.129 --> 17:26.306
You are way too
emotionally involved in this.

17:26.349 --> 17:28.743
I mean, there-there is
a possibility

17:28.786 --> 17:30.353
that he's innocent.

17:30.397 --> 17:32.616
You know what this man
did to our family?

17:32.660 --> 17:34.792
When he abandoned us,
we lost our home.

17:34.836 --> 17:37.360
We had to move to Columbia
to live with our aunt.

17:37.404 --> 17:39.232
We could barely
feed ourselves.

17:39.275 --> 17:42.583
We lived off charity
from a local church.

17:42.626 --> 17:45.281
Trust me, Ellie...

17:45.325 --> 17:47.501
this man is not innocent.

17:47.544 --> 17:50.852
Okay, I get it. He's definitely
guilty of being a crap dad.

17:50.895 --> 17:52.375
But a murderer?

17:56.597 --> 17:59.295
All right, well,
the room is clean.

18:01.819 --> 18:03.560
Yeah.
Too clean.

18:18.184 --> 18:20.360
-This is not his room.
-Hmm?

18:20.403 --> 18:23.014
This is the room he wants
us to believe he was using.

18:25.365 --> 18:27.193
Who's staying next door?

18:27.236 --> 18:29.108
Uh, the manager told me.

18:29.151 --> 18:31.153
Uh... guest named Vega.

18:31.197 --> 18:34.330
That's my mother's maiden name.

18:47.604 --> 18:49.345
So you still
think he's innocent?

18:51.521 --> 18:53.132
<i>The screengrab</i>

18:53.175 --> 18:55.221
you found at the hotel room

18:55.264 --> 18:57.353
was taken from the
Saão Paulo airport

18:57.397 --> 18:59.181
in Brazil
three days ago.

18:59.225 --> 19:00.835
I ran the guy
in the photo

19:00.878 --> 19:02.532
through facial recognition
and a match came up.

19:02.576 --> 19:05.013
Marine Sergeant Thomas Baird,

19:05.056 --> 19:06.493
38, from South Carolina.

19:06.536 --> 19:08.234
Another Marine like our victim.

19:08.277 --> 19:09.322
Uh, yes and no.

19:09.365 --> 19:10.497
He left
the Marines

19:10.540 --> 19:13.674
four years ago,
but he and Larson

19:13.717 --> 19:15.589
did do boot camp together
at the same time.

19:15.632 --> 19:17.112
So they could have
known each other.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.679
Why did Miguel Torres

19:18.722 --> 19:20.898
have a photo of Baird
in his room?

19:20.942 --> 19:22.161
Think he was following him?

19:22.204 --> 19:24.206
If Miguel did kill Larson,

19:24.250 --> 19:26.687
maybe this guy
was his next victim.

19:26.730 --> 19:29.864
Like... maybe Miguel
is hunting down Marines.

19:29.907 --> 19:31.300
Well, do me a favor.

19:31.344 --> 19:33.172
Maybe hold off on sharing
that theory with Nick

19:33.215 --> 19:34.260
until after he's cooled off.

19:34.303 --> 19:36.087
I totally agree.

19:36.131 --> 19:38.351
-Except I already told him.
-What?

19:38.394 --> 19:40.222
He came down here
right before you.

19:40.266 --> 19:43.356
He asked me for an update.
I'm sorry!

19:46.272 --> 19:48.796
Nico.

19:48.839 --> 19:50.189
About time.

19:50.232 --> 19:52.234
What are you doing in D.C.?

19:52.278 --> 19:53.714
Nice to see you, too, son.

19:53.757 --> 19:54.715
Answer the damn question.

19:54.758 --> 19:55.977
And don't give me
any of that crap

19:56.020 --> 19:57.239
that you're a tourist.

19:57.283 --> 19:58.153
'Cause I've been
to your hotel room,

19:58.197 --> 19:59.415
the other room.

19:59.459 --> 20:01.374
-Oh.
-And I found the photo.

20:01.417 --> 20:03.245
Why were you
following Baird?

20:03.289 --> 20:04.638
Were you trying
to kill him, too?

20:04.681 --> 20:06.553
Is that what you think
I am, Nico?

20:06.596 --> 20:08.555
-A killer?
-It's Agent Torres.

20:08.598 --> 20:11.166
And how would I know
what to think of you?

20:11.210 --> 20:12.515
I haven't seen you
in 30 years.

20:12.559 --> 20:15.257
Well, it looks like
it hasn't hurt you much.

20:15.301 --> 20:17.216
I mean,

20:17.259 --> 20:19.261
you're a strong man,
you've got a good job.

20:19.305 --> 20:21.263
Really made something
of yourself.

20:21.307 --> 20:22.743
So you leaving was a good thing?

20:22.786 --> 20:25.093
I don't know.

20:25.136 --> 20:27.400
Maybe it toughened you up
a little bit.

20:27.443 --> 20:30.664
Huh? Made you into
the man are today.

20:30.707 --> 20:32.927
So what should I do, huh?
Should I thank you?

20:32.970 --> 20:35.495
-Hmm?
-Thank me.

20:35.538 --> 20:38.454
Should I thank you?!

20:38.498 --> 20:40.587
-Come on. Come on!
-Nick, Nick, hold on!

20:40.630 --> 20:42.371
-No, come on, come on.
-Come on.

20:42.415 --> 20:43.851
-Hey, let me go! Get off me!
-Come on, come on.

20:43.894 --> 20:46.332
Agent Torres, stand down!
That's an order.

20:46.375 --> 20:47.594
Interrogation's over.

20:47.637 --> 20:48.595
Mr. Torres,

20:48.638 --> 20:49.683
you're free to go.

20:49.726 --> 20:51.337
-What?!
-Why? We can
still hold him.

20:51.380 --> 20:53.034
Because he's working for us.

20:53.077 --> 20:55.297
Pamela Walsh. CIA.

21:05.438 --> 21:07.483
Sorry for back
at the hotel.

21:07.527 --> 21:10.225
If I'd known who you were,
I would have identified myself.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.574
So what are you saying--

21:11.618 --> 21:14.098
that my father
is a spy for the CIA?

21:14.142 --> 21:15.535
More like a
freelance operative.

21:15.578 --> 21:16.492
A fixer.

21:16.536 --> 21:17.841
We've used him
over the years

21:17.885 --> 21:19.800
when we needed a man
down in Latin America.

21:19.843 --> 21:20.801
I can't believe this.

21:20.844 --> 21:21.845
How long has he worked
for the CIA?

21:21.889 --> 21:23.282
Since well before my time.

21:23.325 --> 21:25.458
Miguel's an extremely
valuable asset.

21:25.501 --> 21:27.895
Discreet, doesn't
ask any questions,

21:27.938 --> 21:31.028
gets the job done,
and he is well-paid for that.

21:31.072 --> 21:32.726
Well, it's good to know
he was making a nice living

21:32.769 --> 21:34.684
while my family was starving.

21:36.556 --> 21:39.689
What is Mr. Torres
doing in D.C.?

21:39.733 --> 21:41.517
We hired him to find someone.

21:41.561 --> 21:43.345
Baird, the man in the photo?

21:43.389 --> 21:45.042
Is he CIA, too?

21:45.086 --> 21:46.479
Baird was a part of a team

21:46.522 --> 21:48.394
assigned to capture a man
named Yusif Qassem.

21:48.437 --> 21:49.873
I've heard of him.

21:49.917 --> 21:51.962
He's a high-ranking
money man for Hezbollah.

21:52.006 --> 21:53.573
We received a tip that Qassem
was going to be laundering

21:53.616 --> 21:55.705
ten million through
a casino in Brazil.

21:55.749 --> 21:57.490
So we staged a raid
at his hotel

21:57.533 --> 21:59.230
with Baird as the point man.

21:59.274 --> 22:01.320
But Qassem was tipped off.

22:03.974 --> 22:06.325
Several agents were killed,
Qassem escaped,

22:06.368 --> 22:08.501
and three million
dollars went missing.

22:08.544 --> 22:10.024
You think Baird sold you out?

22:10.067 --> 22:12.069
Before we could apprehend
him, Baird went under.

22:12.113 --> 22:14.376
He was off the radar for years

22:14.420 --> 22:16.378
until two weeks ago,
when we placed him

22:16.422 --> 22:18.075
in a remote part of Argentina.

22:18.119 --> 22:21.252
We didn't know the region, so
we hired Miguel to find him.

22:21.296 --> 22:23.211
Miguel's been chasing him
ever since.

22:23.254 --> 22:25.300
And how does our victim,
Sergeant Larson,

22:25.344 --> 22:26.823
fit into all this?

22:26.867 --> 22:29.696
He knew Baird. Helped him out
with clothes, money,

22:29.739 --> 22:31.698
when Baird went on the run.

22:31.741 --> 22:35.223
And he repaid the favor by
killing him to cover his tracks.

22:35.266 --> 22:38.400
-Okay, that brings us up to
speed, except for one thing.

22:38.444 --> 22:40.315
Why is Baird in D.C.
in the first place?

22:40.359 --> 22:41.751
We don't know.

22:41.795 --> 22:43.318
But Hezbollah chatter
suggests something big

22:43.362 --> 22:46.060
is about to go down,
and we think Baird is involved.

22:46.103 --> 22:47.583
We need him caught.

22:47.627 --> 22:49.324
Well, considering that he killed
a Marine, we do, too.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.544
We'll be taking over
the investigation.

22:51.587 --> 22:53.110
Absolutely not.

22:53.154 --> 22:56.331
This is a CIA op.
I'm only here as a courtesy.

22:56.375 --> 22:59.726
Last I checked, the CIA
can't operate on domestic soil.

22:59.769 --> 23:01.467
So you can either
work with us

23:01.510 --> 23:03.643
or the FBI.
It's your choice.

23:03.686 --> 23:05.340
Fine.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.516
But I want my man involved.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.736
You work with Miguel
on everything.

23:09.779 --> 23:12.434
And as soon as you find Baird,
I want to know.

23:12.478 --> 23:14.349
All right.
We can do that.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.656
We will keep in touch,
Officer Walsh.

23:21.835 --> 23:23.010
Agent Torres?

23:24.664 --> 23:27.144
I want to be removed
from the case.

23:27.188 --> 23:28.842
I can't work
with him.

23:28.885 --> 23:30.539
I won't.

23:30.583 --> 23:34.587
Your father has been tracking
Baird for weeks now.

23:34.630 --> 23:37.503
He could be of
real use to us.

23:37.546 --> 23:39.156
Look, I feel for you.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.332
As a father, I can't imagine
doing to my kid

23:41.376 --> 23:42.725
what your father did to you.

23:42.769 --> 23:45.119
But you're one of my
best agents, Nick.

23:45.162 --> 23:48.383
And with Gibbs gone,
I can't afford to lose another.

23:52.169 --> 23:53.214
Sir.

23:53.257 --> 23:54.476
Thank you.

23:56.391 --> 23:57.479
<i>Our suspect,</i>

23:57.523 --> 23:59.742
Thomas Baird, is
very methodical,

23:59.786 --> 24:02.005
changes his
appearance often.

24:02.049 --> 24:04.573
Before you guys
picked me up at the hotel,

24:04.617 --> 24:07.010
I learned that Baird
rented an apartment

24:07.054 --> 24:09.273
-in the D.C. area.
-You search it?

24:09.317 --> 24:10.884
It was wiped clean.

24:10.927 --> 24:13.277
The only thing that was left
was a little piece of paper

24:13.321 --> 24:14.714
with the word "Marinco."

24:14.757 --> 24:16.803
Hmm. At least
he left a note behind.

24:21.590 --> 24:23.287
You know what, it's late.

24:23.331 --> 24:24.854
Um, how about we, uh,

24:24.898 --> 24:27.683
call it a night, start again
fresh in the morning?

24:33.472 --> 24:35.735
Wait, Nico.

24:36.866 --> 24:38.738
Nick.

24:38.781 --> 24:40.435
Can we talk a second?

24:43.917 --> 24:46.006
Look, I'm sorry
I didn't come clean,

24:46.049 --> 24:47.181
earlier,

24:47.224 --> 24:49.183
about the CIA.

24:49.226 --> 24:51.533
Why don't we make
the best of it? You know?

24:51.577 --> 24:53.404
Go grab a drink,
you know,

24:53.448 --> 24:55.885
catch up?

24:55.929 --> 24:58.105
You really don't get it, do you?

24:58.148 --> 24:59.193
What?

24:59.236 --> 25:01.151
I want nothing to do with you.

25:04.111 --> 25:07.636
All right, so I guess you don't
want to know why I left?

25:09.899 --> 25:11.118
Hmm?

25:15.775 --> 25:18.342
It was the late '80s.

25:18.386 --> 25:19.996
We were living in Panama then.

25:20.040 --> 25:22.564
I was working
for the police force.

25:22.608 --> 25:25.828
Noriega was in power.
Dangerous times.

25:25.872 --> 25:27.308
Just spare me
the history lesson.

25:27.351 --> 25:28.875
Yeah, well, what you don't know

25:28.918 --> 25:31.617
is that I was secretly working
with the opposition

25:31.660 --> 25:33.619
I was working
undercover

25:33.662 --> 25:36.665
-to overthrow Noriega.
-Noriega?

25:36.709 --> 25:38.101
-Yeah.
-No.

25:38.145 --> 25:39.276
Mom would have told me.

25:39.320 --> 25:41.191
Mom never knew.

25:41.235 --> 25:43.759
She would have worried,
and rightfully so.

25:43.803 --> 25:46.414
Noriega's men started
getting suspicious of me,

25:46.457 --> 25:48.416
they started
looking at me closer.

25:48.459 --> 25:50.766
-Mm.
-I was about to blow my cover,

25:50.810 --> 25:52.463
so I did the only thing
I could do--

25:52.507 --> 25:53.943
I packed up
and I left the country.

25:53.987 --> 25:55.597
Mm-hmm.
To save your own ass.

25:55.641 --> 25:58.731
No.
To save yours.

25:59.645 --> 26:03.431
I had to leave.
To protect my family.

26:03.474 --> 26:07.174
The U.S. took Noriega down
in 1990.

26:08.784 --> 26:10.612
Why didn't you come back?

26:10.656 --> 26:13.702
After Panama...

26:13.746 --> 26:16.487
I ended up in Nicaragua,

26:16.531 --> 26:17.967
working with the Contras.

26:18.011 --> 26:22.493
Then I somehow ended up
in Cuba working for the CIA.

26:22.537 --> 26:25.148
Some more jobs came.

26:25.192 --> 26:27.150
Also more enemies.

26:27.194 --> 26:28.499
I couldn't come home

26:28.543 --> 26:31.633
and risk putting
your lives in danger.

26:31.677 --> 26:34.897
Our line of work
can put a terrible price

26:34.941 --> 26:38.031
on those we love
if we're not careful.

26:38.858 --> 26:40.990
You should know that
more than anyone.

26:41.034 --> 26:44.646
Your sister, her husband.
He died

26:44.690 --> 26:48.128
because of your work
undercover in Argentina?

26:48.171 --> 26:50.434
Yeah.

26:50.478 --> 26:52.698
And I have to live with that.

26:53.568 --> 26:55.657
But I came back for Lucia.

26:55.701 --> 26:58.051
And I stayed.
How do you even know about that?

26:58.094 --> 27:00.488
You don't think
I checked on you

27:00.531 --> 27:03.404
and your sister,
all of your lives?

27:03.447 --> 27:05.885
I even sent money when I could.

27:05.928 --> 27:07.800
No.
The Church took care of us.

27:07.843 --> 27:09.889
And who do you think
took care of the Church?

27:16.678 --> 27:19.072
<i>Mi hijo...</i>

27:19.899 --> 27:21.727
...I'm not perfect.

27:22.728 --> 27:25.078
But I did
the best I could.

27:41.442 --> 27:44.184
Go and get it.

27:53.019 --> 27:54.716
Hi.

27:54.760 --> 27:56.718
-Oh, hi.
-Come on.

27:56.762 --> 27:58.677
Were you gonna knock?

27:59.503 --> 28:01.244
I hadn't quite decided.

28:01.288 --> 28:03.856
Well, what's to debate?
Come on in. Uh...

28:03.899 --> 28:05.553
You want something to drink?
Glass of water?

28:05.596 --> 28:08.164
Uh, oh, no, thanks.

28:10.427 --> 28:12.168
What can I do for you?

28:12.212 --> 28:15.737
After our meeting at the diner,
I realized that I had a question

28:15.781 --> 28:17.739
that I never got around
to asking you.

28:17.783 --> 28:20.394
Okay. Shoot.

28:21.482 --> 28:23.049
Why?

28:23.919 --> 28:25.747
-Why?
-I mean, not

28:25.791 --> 28:28.707
why you did what you did,
uh, on the case.

28:28.750 --> 28:32.319
I mean, you made that perfectly
clear and what's done is done.

28:32.362 --> 28:36.279
But why did you choose
to tell me?

28:36.627 --> 28:38.499
-Because you wanted the truth.
-Yeah, but

28:38.542 --> 28:42.285
most people don't offer it up
quite so generously.

28:42.329 --> 28:43.765
You know, I...
at-at first, I thought

28:43.809 --> 28:47.290
maybe you had, you know,
spilled the beans in order

28:47.334 --> 28:49.118
to get ahead
of the story.

28:49.162 --> 28:51.338
You know, as, like, a Hail Mary
to save your badge.

28:51.381 --> 28:53.688
-No. It wasn't.
-And I realize that now.

28:53.732 --> 28:57.300
I mean, you didn't even
try to appeal your suspension.

28:57.344 --> 29:00.303
So why come clean?

29:02.566 --> 29:07.354
Or maybe you don't even know
why you do what you do?

29:09.182 --> 29:11.488
Maybe I don't.

29:14.056 --> 29:15.492
Okay.

29:17.233 --> 29:18.669
I'm working on a thing.

29:18.713 --> 29:21.150
And I would
really appreciate

29:21.194 --> 29:22.586
your opinion.

29:22.630 --> 29:26.808
So, I'm hoping
you'll give it a read.

29:26.852 --> 29:29.855
That is, if you find
yourself bored.

29:32.161 --> 29:33.336
Okay. Thanks.

29:33.380 --> 29:35.817
Um, good night.

29:35.861 --> 29:37.123
Yeah. Night.

29:37.166 --> 29:38.733
Night.

29:43.738 --> 29:45.522
Mmm, this is delicious.
It looks good.

29:45.566 --> 29:48.308
Ah? You look it?
Yeah, I like it.

29:48.351 --> 29:51.137
Mmm. These are so good.

29:51.180 --> 29:52.312
What are these
called again?

29:52.355 --> 29:53.661
Hojaldres.

29:53.704 --> 29:55.445
They're Panamanian specialty.

29:55.489 --> 29:56.707
I think we had
something like this

29:56.751 --> 29:58.622
at that restaurant
that Nick took me to.

29:58.666 --> 30:00.146
Oh, hey, Nick. Hey.

30:00.189 --> 30:02.148
Uh, your dad's here.
Uh, he brought us breakfast.

30:02.191 --> 30:03.845
Yeah, I found

30:03.889 --> 30:06.195
a little Panamanian bakery
near the hotel.

30:06.239 --> 30:07.283
I picked up
your favorites.

30:07.327 --> 30:09.372
Hojaldres.

30:09.416 --> 30:11.810
Yeah, I'm not hungry.

30:11.853 --> 30:13.768
Hey.

30:15.509 --> 30:16.684
He's playing you.

30:16.727 --> 30:19.252
Okay, or maybe
he's making an effort.

30:19.295 --> 30:20.993
After what he told you
last night.

30:21.036 --> 30:22.559
I still don't trust him.

30:22.603 --> 30:25.040
You know, when you go undercover
for those many years,

30:25.084 --> 30:28.435
live in the grey area...

30:28.478 --> 30:30.219
something happens to a person.

30:30.263 --> 30:31.394
Which...
is exactly

30:31.438 --> 30:34.658
how we felt about you
five years ago.

30:34.702 --> 30:37.661
It's never too late
to start over, Nick. You know?

30:39.881 --> 30:41.752
Hey, McGee,

30:41.796 --> 30:43.580
can I interest you
in an hojaldres?

30:43.624 --> 30:46.627
Uh, no, I'm good.
I, uh, think I have a lead here.

30:46.670 --> 30:49.064
Oh, Jimmy, that's our cue.

30:49.108 --> 30:50.805
I just checked
Baird's apartment,

30:50.849 --> 30:53.416
-found this by the window.
Oh, yeah.

30:53.460 --> 30:56.028
I saw that, too.
They're furniture marks.

30:56.071 --> 30:58.247
-Well, actually, I think those
marks are made by a tripod.

30:58.291 --> 30:59.858
I talked to the landlord,

30:59.901 --> 31:01.033
he said that Baird

31:01.076 --> 31:03.600
specifically asked
for that apartment.

31:03.644 --> 31:05.907
He was insistent on it,
said he liked the view,

31:05.951 --> 31:07.082
but I think he was
scoping something out.

31:07.126 --> 31:08.649
Any idea what he was looking at?

31:08.692 --> 31:11.739
Well, possible nearby targets,
um, there'd be two of them.

31:11.782 --> 31:15.612
Turkish embassy and Northern
Virginia Savings and Trust bank.

31:15.656 --> 31:17.092
I'll take the bank.

31:18.137 --> 31:19.834
Um, somebody go with him?

31:19.878 --> 31:21.270
Uh, Nick.

31:21.314 --> 31:23.229
I'll take embassy.

31:23.272 --> 31:25.840
Um...

31:25.884 --> 31:27.059
Okay.

31:32.238 --> 31:33.717
Hey, you in charge?

31:33.761 --> 31:34.762
Yeah.
Who the hell are you?

31:34.805 --> 31:36.372
NCIS.
What happened?

31:36.416 --> 31:37.983
Bank got hit
about 20 minutes ago.

31:38.026 --> 31:39.593
Guy came in,
threw some smoke bombs,

31:39.636 --> 31:41.116
shot a couple security guards.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.291
Did you check the video cameras?

31:42.335 --> 31:43.902
-Yeah.
-Did you see his face?

31:43.945 --> 31:45.599
Yeah, that's him.

31:46.643 --> 31:48.297
Yeah, how much money
did he take?

31:48.341 --> 31:51.561
Well, that's the thing.
He wasn't here for the money.

31:51.605 --> 31:53.868
He took the bank manager.

32:02.529 --> 32:04.705
-All right, so what do we know
about the bank manager

32:04.748 --> 32:06.141
-Baird took?
Charles Park,

32:06.185 --> 32:07.926
52, divorced, no kids.

32:07.969 --> 32:10.667
He's been a manager at
Savings and Trust for two years.

32:10.711 --> 32:13.148
Before that, he was an
accountant for a local firm.

32:13.192 --> 32:15.020
Find any connection
between this guy and Baird?

32:15.063 --> 32:16.151
Not that I can see.

32:16.195 --> 32:17.196
Bishop, put out a BOLO.

32:17.239 --> 32:18.371
Airport, state police.

32:18.414 --> 32:19.850
On it.

32:19.894 --> 32:21.852
So where do you think
-Baird went?
-The bank manager

32:21.896 --> 32:24.551
he took does have a cabin
in Warren County.

32:24.594 --> 32:25.856
It's pretty remote out there.

32:25.900 --> 32:27.728
-Go check it out?
-I'll go with him.

32:27.771 --> 32:29.686
That is, if you don't mind.

32:35.040 --> 32:36.606
Yeah, okay.

32:38.521 --> 32:40.741
Yeah, on my way, Kasie.

32:42.830 --> 32:44.049
<i>I found the missing connection</i>

32:44.092 --> 32:47.139
between Baird
and the bank manager.

32:47.182 --> 32:48.749
Marinco?

32:48.792 --> 32:50.969
The word that Baird had
at his apartment?

32:51.012 --> 32:53.928
So, the accounting firm
Charles Park used to work for

32:53.972 --> 32:56.713
was investigated a dozen times
for money laundering.

32:56.757 --> 32:58.237
But one of the
shell companies

32:58.280 --> 33:02.893
Park set up was named
Marin Company Transnational,

33:02.937 --> 33:03.894
also known as...

33:03.938 --> 33:05.635
Marin Co.

33:05.679 --> 33:07.898
So Baird was interested
in a shell company. Why?

33:07.942 --> 33:11.206
I was able to find out
it was formed two years ago,

33:11.250 --> 33:15.080
exactly one week before
Baird's CIA raid in Brazil.

33:15.123 --> 33:17.473
And guess how much
was deposited.

33:17.517 --> 33:18.997
Three million dollars.

33:19.040 --> 33:20.346
Mm-hmm.

33:20.389 --> 33:21.825
Park laundered the stolen money
from the raid.

33:21.869 --> 33:23.349
This whole thing
has been about the money.

33:23.392 --> 33:24.915
Yeah, but why'd Baird
take him in the first place?

33:24.959 --> 33:26.569
I mean, were they...
were they partners?

33:26.613 --> 33:28.963
Wonder what Baird's up to.

33:32.184 --> 33:33.837
<i>Mira.</i>

33:52.726 --> 33:54.641
You got it.

34:12.267 --> 34:13.747
Another move and I kill him.

34:13.790 --> 34:15.531
Easy. We're not
here to hurt you.

34:15.575 --> 34:16.837
Yeah, tell that to him.

34:16.880 --> 34:18.665
He's been
after me for weeks.

34:18.708 --> 34:20.014
Will you put down the gun,
Baird.

34:20.058 --> 34:21.798
What did they
tell you about me?

34:21.842 --> 34:23.017
That I sold out my team?

34:23.061 --> 34:26.151
I'm innocent.
I was framed.

34:26.194 --> 34:27.500
Then why'd you take Park?

34:28.762 --> 34:30.068
So I could find out
who framed me.

34:30.111 --> 34:32.853
I figure since this worm
helped hide the money,

34:32.896 --> 34:34.594
he'd be able to tell me
who he hid it for.

34:34.637 --> 34:36.639
I figured right.

34:43.168 --> 34:46.519
Check the front page.
Owner's signature.

34:56.746 --> 34:59.140
CIA officer Walsh.

34:59.184 --> 35:00.837
She set me up.

35:00.881 --> 35:02.622
You've been playing
for the wrong side.

35:02.665 --> 35:04.319
You didn't even know it.

35:06.539 --> 35:08.062
Who else knows we're here?

35:30.650 --> 35:32.652
I'm out of bullets.

35:32.695 --> 35:33.957
Get him out of here!

35:46.056 --> 35:48.494
Come on, come on.
Got to move.

35:48.537 --> 35:50.713
Move, move, move.
Move.

36:03.596 --> 36:06.555
-Yeah, come on, come on.
-Nico, Nico.

36:06.599 --> 36:09.384
He's in bad shape.
We can't keep running.

36:09.428 --> 36:11.212
No.

36:11.256 --> 36:13.910
No, we can't.

36:58.477 --> 36:59.695
Nico.

36:59.739 --> 37:01.393
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

37:02.481 --> 37:04.222
Stop right there.

37:04.265 --> 37:05.397
Where's Baird?

37:05.440 --> 37:07.616
Walsh... it's over.

37:07.660 --> 37:10.271
Where is he?

37:19.889 --> 37:21.761
He couldn't have gone too far.

37:21.804 --> 37:23.197
I'll take
care of him

37:23.241 --> 37:25.243
right after I take care
of you two.

37:29.072 --> 37:32.032
No!

37:38.821 --> 37:40.823
No.

37:40.867 --> 37:43.391
No, no.

37:43.435 --> 37:45.132
Papa.

37:47.352 --> 37:49.179
Papa.

38:09.722 --> 38:11.332
The CIA claims that
they didn't even know

38:11.376 --> 38:14.466
Miguel was in the country,
let alone hired by Walsh.

38:14.509 --> 38:15.641
She acted alone.

38:15.684 --> 38:18.078
So Walsh killed
Sergeant Larson?

38:18.121 --> 38:20.036
Baird, uh, must have
told him what was going on.

38:20.080 --> 38:21.821
She took him out
to cover her tracks.

38:21.864 --> 38:23.562
And those guys
with the guns?

38:23.605 --> 38:25.041
Russian hit men.

38:25.085 --> 38:27.653
Walsh hired them
as an insurance policy.

38:27.696 --> 38:29.742
Pretty much wraps everything up.

38:31.004 --> 38:32.310
Not everything.

38:40.230 --> 38:43.321
-Hey.
-Hey.

38:43.364 --> 38:44.496
Anything broken?

38:44.539 --> 38:47.063
They're gonna do an X-ray.

38:47.107 --> 38:49.849
I think I'll live.

38:55.289 --> 38:58.292
I-I just wanted to say, uh...

39:00.816 --> 39:03.558
...thank you
for what you did back there.

39:03.602 --> 39:06.866
I had to protect my family.

39:08.346 --> 39:10.348
Right.

39:10.391 --> 39:12.393
Mm.

39:14.308 --> 39:16.658
So, what are your plans?

39:18.356 --> 39:19.618
I'm not sure.

39:23.273 --> 39:25.014
Maybe, uh...

39:25.058 --> 39:28.844
Maybe we could
grab a bite a little later.

39:28.888 --> 39:30.150
Even visit

39:30.193 --> 39:32.370
Lucia, and you could
meet your granddaughter

39:32.413 --> 39:33.371
for the first time.

39:33.414 --> 39:36.591
Sounds nice.

39:40.073 --> 39:42.728
Okay.

39:42.771 --> 39:45.165
All right, I'll pick you up
at the hotel at 8:00.

40:06.099 --> 40:07.622
I'm so proud of you.

40:07.666 --> 40:10.146
Well, you know, it's never too
late to start all over again.

40:10.190 --> 40:12.105
-Right?
-Mm.

41:03.243 --> 41:07.508
Hey, hey.
Good girl.

41:12.600 --> 41:14.123
Hey, it's open.

41:19.520 --> 41:21.783
Nick.

41:21.827 --> 41:23.655
I thought you were
having dinner with your dad.

41:27.615 --> 41:29.225
I don't want to talk about it.

41:33.099 --> 41:35.928
Think you came
to the right place.

41:37.320 --> 41:38.844
Have a seat.

41:41.934 --> 41:43.762
Sit down.

42:14.096 --> 42:16.055
Eat.

42:29.416 --> 42:30.896
Mmm.

42:32.462 --> 42:34.682
Mm-hmm.
