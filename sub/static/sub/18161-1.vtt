00:51.593 --> 00:53.328
Jason, Stephanie.

00:53.428 --> 00:55.789
Inside voice and
walking feet, please.

00:55.889 --> 00:58.157
Yes, Miss Bell.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.362
This is great.

01:04.313 --> 01:05.786
Popcorn on a string?

01:06.900 --> 01:08.622
Looking for someone?

01:08.735 --> 01:10.082
James.

01:11.488 --> 01:13.807
- I'm so happy you made it.
- Of course I made it.

01:13.907 --> 01:16.602
Next time, use that
app I showed you...

01:16.702 --> 01:18.299
then you'll see...

01:18.412 --> 01:20.063
if I'm not with you...

01:20.163 --> 01:21.760
I'm always on my way.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.361
So how was the big holiday pageant?

01:26.461 --> 01:30.324
Terrific, if you ignore the fact that two of
the shepherds were picking their noses...

01:30.424 --> 01:32.367
and Mary twisted her
ankle on the dreidel.

01:32.467 --> 01:35.236
- Oh. A Judeo-Christian mishap.
- Heh.

01:36.597 --> 01:39.992
I'm so happy we're spending
Christmas together.

01:41.351 --> 01:42.794
So are you ready for tonight?

01:42.894 --> 01:46.882
The Ballantine Capital Holiday Party
is the social event of the season.

01:46.982 --> 01:48.383
At least to the Ballantines.

01:48.483 --> 01:50.260
I'm still debating on what to wear.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.347
Well, I'm sure whatever you wear,
you will look beautiful.

01:53.447 --> 01:57.142
And my mother will scrutinize your
dress and find it distasteful.

01:57.242 --> 01:59.770
Oh. Sounds like fun. Heh.

01:59.870 --> 02:03.299
It will be, as long
as we're together.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.269
- Come on, I'll show you my classroom.
- Oh.

02:14.760 --> 02:17.329
Good job today. Merry Christmas.

02:17.429 --> 02:19.665
- Bye.
- Bye, everyone. Merry Christmas.

02:19.765 --> 02:23.210
- Miss Bell?
- Oh, Mrs. Low. Wasn't Bobby just darling...?

02:23.310 --> 02:26.296
- I can't find him. I've looked everywhere.
- I'm sure he's here.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.382
Okay, why don't you
check the cubby room?

02:28.482 --> 02:30.300
- I'll look in the classroom.
- Okay.

02:30.400 --> 02:33.845
- I'm sure he's hiding under one of the desks.
- Oh, yeah.

02:33.945 --> 02:35.292
Come on, in the car.

02:41.703 --> 02:46.066
Honey? Heh, you know what?
I think I left my scarf by the manger.

02:46.166 --> 02:49.403
- Will you run and get it?
- Scarf retrieval. Can do.

02:49.503 --> 02:53.524
Thank you, sweetie.
I'll go check on Bobby.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.214
Stop!

03:24.162 --> 03:25.759
Hey!

03:26.748 --> 03:28.721
Miss Bell?

03:32.337 --> 03:33.934
Miss Bell, that's my dad.

03:34.673 --> 03:36.742
He is? You are?

03:38.218 --> 03:40.454
Oh. Oh.

03:40.554 --> 03:45.417
Well, unfortunately, the faculty was informed
your visitation rights have been suspended.

03:45.517 --> 03:48.503
- It's Christmas.
- Bobby, say goodbye to your dad...

03:48.603 --> 03:51.214
- ...and then go find your mom.
- Okay. I love you, Dad.

03:51.314 --> 03:53.537
- Bye, Bobby.
- Bye.

03:58.321 --> 04:00.589
- Do you have a phone?
- Yeah.

04:00.741 --> 04:03.143
You're lucky I'm in the
holiday mood, Mr. Low.

04:03.243 --> 04:06.980
You see, if I call this into the police,
you would be in big trouble.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.883
But if you did,
they'll probably give you a break.

04:13.003 --> 04:15.055
Merry Christmas.

04:15.589 --> 04:16.906
Was he under the desk?

04:17.007 --> 04:19.242
Yep, I know my Bobby.

04:19.341 --> 04:23.080
So you ready to face my parents?

04:23.180 --> 04:25.574
I think I can handle it.

04:30.937 --> 04:32.589
Yes. Wait out front.

04:36.318 --> 04:39.471
Before my mother gets the
chance to berate you...

04:39.571 --> 04:42.724
I have to say you look amazing.

04:42.824 --> 04:45.752
- Flattery will get you everywhere.
- Oh. Heh.

04:47.078 --> 04:51.024
Honey, why is everything so quiet?

04:51.124 --> 04:52.651
This is a party, isn't it?

04:52.751 --> 04:55.862
Don't tell them.
They might actually smile.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.354
Oh, got it.

04:57.714 --> 05:01.827
Incoming Ballantines at 10 o'clock.
Remember, my parents are old money.

05:01.927 --> 05:03.870
- Establishment. Upper crust.
- Aloof. Arrogant.

05:03.970 --> 05:06.039
- This is gonna be fun. Hi.
- Hi.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.708
- Dad.
- James.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.451
- Oh, darling.
- Mom.

05:10.602 --> 05:13.588
I'd like you to meet Tory Bell.

05:13.688 --> 05:15.215
Hi.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.209
- Told you.
- Well, I'm glad you could join us, Tara.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.679
It's Tory.

05:20.779 --> 05:22.180
Happy holidays.

05:22.280 --> 05:26.935
Not half as happy as yours is going to be.
The south of France sounds so exciting.

05:27.035 --> 05:28.437
Oh, you've never been?

05:29.704 --> 05:32.382
Sorry. Heh.

05:34.042 --> 05:36.720
Will you just excuse me for a moment?

05:38.088 --> 05:42.075
Dad, I know you have your reservations,
but I really have feelings for Tory.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.786
- How much do you know about this girl?
- I care about her.

05:44.886 --> 05:48.373
I know I wanna be with her.
And I know for me, that's enough.

05:48.473 --> 05:49.583
<i>Guess who.</i>

05:49.683 --> 05:51.585
Sorry, drawing a blank.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.336
<i>I'm hurt, Tornado.</i>

05:53.436 --> 05:58.550
<i>Spending six years on the inside
kept your memory very fresh for me.</i>

05:58.650 --> 06:00.427
I didn't know they
allowed calls this late.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.805
<i>Read the morning papers, Bell.</i>

06:03.905 --> 06:06.600
<i>I'm out. And I'm coming for you.</i>

06:06.700 --> 06:08.718
<i>All of you.</i>

06:09.661 --> 06:11.354
- Fresh glass?
- I have to go.

06:11.454 --> 06:13.398
- Go where?
- I have to leave.

06:13.498 --> 06:18.599
- I get it. You've had enough.
- No, I have to leave New York right now.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.823
- No, what...?
- I can't get into it right now.

06:21.923 --> 06:24.567
It's just... It's too much.
But I love you.

06:24.801 --> 06:27.913
I'm about to give my toast.
Where should we all stand?

06:28.013 --> 06:29.664
Unfortunately, I have to go...

06:29.764 --> 06:32.209
but I'm sure it will
be a great toast.

06:32.309 --> 06:33.418
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.003
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

06:35.103 --> 06:37.371
I have to go help my parents...

06:38.481 --> 06:40.328
with stuff.

06:42.402 --> 06:43.512
- Tory.
- James, please.

06:43.612 --> 06:46.473
Tory, I just need to know that
you're okay. That we're okay.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.016
We're totally okay.

06:48.116 --> 06:51.144
Look, I promise, I will explain
everything to you at New Year's.

06:51.244 --> 06:55.148
- New Year's? What about...?
- I will so make this up to you.

06:55.248 --> 06:58.568
It will be a whole different
kind of celebration.

06:58.668 --> 07:00.311
Something like...

07:04.925 --> 07:06.226
You can do that?

07:06.635 --> 07:07.869
I'm willing to try.

07:07.969 --> 07:12.833
Okay. I'm completely baffled,
but my New Year's countdown starts now.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.408
New Year's.

07:19.689 --> 07:22.913
You are a mysterious
woman, Tory Bell.

07:23.068 --> 07:25.370
- Ma'am.
- Thank you.

07:28.156 --> 07:30.550
10th and 1st for a quick stop.

07:31.868 --> 07:35.092
Then Trenton, New Jersey.
In a hurry, please.

08:15.578 --> 08:17.772
- Baby.
- Daddy.

08:17.872 --> 08:20.567
- Sweetheart.
- Mommy.

08:22.168 --> 08:25.142
- Did you flip your daddy again?
- Yeah.

08:25.964 --> 08:27.866
Ma, clothes.

08:27.966 --> 08:30.035
Oh. How'd I raise such a prude?

08:30.135 --> 08:32.412
She's so cute.

08:32.511 --> 08:35.039
Look at you. You look like
a real New Yorker now.

08:35.140 --> 08:37.442
I didn't hardly...

08:37.851 --> 08:40.086
I'm gonna get you something
for your shoulder.

08:40.186 --> 08:43.080
She took you down pretty hard.
That's my girl.

08:43.188 --> 08:46.993
What were you thinking, Dad?
That move has never worked on me.

08:47.318 --> 08:49.054
You're home for the holidays?

08:49.154 --> 08:52.098
- Kind of for the holidays.
- Not spending it with that new guy?

08:52.198 --> 08:55.060
I Googled him. I gotta know
what my little girl is up to.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.437
Guys, guys, guys, look,
I'm so happy to see you...

08:57.537 --> 09:00.273
but I'm actually not just
here for the holidays.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.901
- I got a call.
- Monte's Motorcycles?

09:03.001 --> 09:06.350
- I put your name in the raffle.
- I got a call from Manucci.

09:06.463 --> 09:08.949
He's still got 20 years
on his sentence.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.993
He's out, and he's coming for us.

09:12.093 --> 09:15.317
- For me.
- He threatened you?

09:15.472 --> 09:16.915
I was always afraid of this.

09:17.015 --> 09:20.168
You took him out when you were
a teenager. Drove him crazy.

09:20.268 --> 09:21.911
We gotta take him down again.

09:22.520 --> 09:23.630
Put him away for good.

09:23.730 --> 09:27.092
I'll get cousin Bones to put
a tail on Manucci's sister.

09:27.192 --> 09:29.915
I wanna know where
Big Donna's heading.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.597
Nobody threatens the Bells.

09:32.697 --> 09:34.920
Nobody.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.052
Welcome home, Tornado.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.186
Let's get to work.

09:48.963 --> 09:52.016
Our tail said Big
Donna should be here.

09:56.387 --> 09:59.065
Yep. Big Donna's definitely here.

10:05.146 --> 10:09.451
You and me will suit up so Donna and
her bodyguards don't pick us out.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.915
Ma? What's up?

10:41.015 --> 10:44.285
You never could get
your hair right yourself.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.220
Still gorgeous.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.222
That does not look like me.

10:56.322 --> 10:58.266
It used to.

10:58.366 --> 11:01.394
I can't believe I got
my baby girl back.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.563
You sure you're up for this?

11:03.663 --> 11:05.215
Yeah, I'm cool.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.237
- Ma?
- Yeah, hon?

11:11.337 --> 11:13.573
What if someone sees
me in these pants?

11:14.841 --> 11:17.368
Let's go catch a bad guy.

11:21.472 --> 11:25.043
- You sure I look okay?
- I think you look gorgeous.

11:25.143 --> 11:27.161
Okay.

11:29.063 --> 11:30.410
Wow.

11:32.233 --> 11:33.468
He's your tail?

11:33.568 --> 11:37.013
Just because you two broke up
doesn't mean we fired him.

11:37.113 --> 11:39.290
Hey, come here.

11:40.116 --> 11:42.435
Be careful out there.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.088
I love sounding official.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.112
What?

11:52.212 --> 11:54.280
Electric blue pumps look good on you.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.783
Very funny, but I have work to do.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.952
- Tweaking on seeing me?
- I'm not tweaking.

11:59.052 --> 12:02.122
I just... I wanna get this done
and I don't want any distractions.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.749
And I'm a distraction now?
I used to be your partner.

12:04.849 --> 12:07.368
I have a new boyfriend now,
and a new life.

12:07.644 --> 12:11.464
I heard. In fact, most of Trenton has heard.
An investment banker. Pretty fancy.

12:11.564 --> 12:15.218
As much as I'm enjoying the small talk,
this is what we're going to do.

12:15.318 --> 12:18.263
As soon as we see Big Donna,
you guys take the bodyguards out.

12:18.363 --> 12:21.850
I'll get close enough to drop the
tracking device, then we're out.

12:21.950 --> 12:24.018
Dad, Tory. You copy?

12:24.118 --> 12:26.967
<i>Sweetie, code names, remember?</i>

12:27.080 --> 12:32.318
Right. Tornado to Banshee-1.
Any sighting of the target?

12:32.418 --> 12:34.766
No target present. Black Hawk?

12:35.004 --> 12:36.447
No visual.

12:36.547 --> 12:38.099
Ho-ho-ho.

12:54.607 --> 12:58.252
I've got her.
She's definitely covered.

13:07.078 --> 13:08.479
<i>Did she spot you?</i>

13:08.579 --> 13:12.258
No. She's looking at shoes.

13:12.500 --> 13:15.403
Hideous shoes, but shoes.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.851
<i>And the bodyguards?</i>

13:18.798 --> 13:21.726
Too close. We can't move yet.

13:38.568 --> 13:41.554
She's at the salon. There's no
way they'll let the bodyguards...

13:41.654 --> 13:45.379
into the treatment rooms.
Now is the time to take them out.

13:54.751 --> 13:55.985
Whoop.

13:59.881 --> 14:01.478
Here you go.

14:06.512 --> 14:10.237
- I just need someone to touch up my gels.
- Sure. Let me see what I can do.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.336
Whenever you have an opening.

14:13.436 --> 14:15.909
Move. Now.

14:26.282 --> 14:27.834
It's true what they say.

14:27.992 --> 14:32.092
The right undergarment makes
a woman feel like a woman.

14:33.456 --> 14:35.474
You coming?

14:38.503 --> 14:39.904
She'll be in there a while.

14:40.004 --> 14:41.447
Ain't that the truth.

14:41.547 --> 14:44.441
- I'm going to hit the head.
- All right.

14:56.479 --> 14:58.965
One down. He'll be out for a while.

14:59.065 --> 15:01.367
Ho-ho-ho.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.683
You want a closer look?

15:08.783 --> 15:11.381
Come on, don't be shy.

15:20.253 --> 15:23.227
Come closer.

15:41.524 --> 15:44.919
Two down. And out.

15:53.995 --> 15:55.968
Puppy?

16:01.961 --> 16:04.434
Come on, Mike.

16:05.006 --> 16:06.432
Come on.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.617
Thank you, Santa.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.883
- Is he okay?
- Yeah, he slipped.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.956
- Slipped?
- Yeah.

16:35.661 --> 16:38.384
Three down. It's all you, Tor.

16:51.719 --> 16:53.996
Tory "Wild Woman" Bell?

16:54.096 --> 16:57.320
I can't believe you're back.

17:00.811 --> 17:01.921
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.840
We're gonna have to catch up later.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.800
Tony? Mario?

17:09.529 --> 17:12.048
Cover's blown. She's running.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.172
Excuse me.

17:20.498 --> 17:22.775
Excuse me. Pardon me.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.551
Watch it!

17:26.671 --> 17:28.518
Excuse me.

17:39.183 --> 17:42.111
What's wrong, Manhattan?
Jersey too rough for you now?

17:49.026 --> 17:51.304
Out for a day of beauty, Donna?

17:51.404 --> 17:53.806
A girl's gotta look her best.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.600
Now, back off me, Bell.

17:55.700 --> 17:56.767
All of you.

17:56.867 --> 18:00.046
I know my rights.
You can't hassle me like this.

18:01.455 --> 18:03.065
I'm a classy lady in these parts.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.394
You're right, Donna. I'm sorry.

18:07.878 --> 18:09.906
We just get ahead of
ourselves sometimes.

18:10.006 --> 18:12.400
That's more like it.

18:22.977 --> 18:25.496
It's like you never left, Tor.

18:28.649 --> 18:30.551
Oh, cousin Bones is texting.

18:30.651 --> 18:33.249
According to Bones,
she's heading east on Ashmore.

18:36.490 --> 18:39.018
Oh, no, you're not going anywhere.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.646
Mikey Muscles. How's it hanging?

18:41.746 --> 18:43.105
Lizzie the Legs.

18:43.205 --> 18:47.818
- Shaved, moisturized and ready for action.
- I'd love to catch up, but this really isn't the...

18:47.918 --> 18:50.404
First of all, you never told
me you were coming back.

18:50.504 --> 18:52.532
What the front door
is that all about?

18:52.632 --> 18:54.200
- I miss you, girl.
- I...

18:54.300 --> 18:57.787
Second, I thought you got out of the
bounty business. That's why you left.

18:57.887 --> 19:00.289
She thought she did too.
But we pulled her back in.

19:00.389 --> 19:01.874
Well, I'm glad.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.418
Liz, I got a great
teaching job there.

19:04.518 --> 19:06.712
So what, you move to
Manhattan and that's it?

19:06.812 --> 19:09.340
It's only through the Holland Tunnel.

19:09.440 --> 19:12.334
But I guess it's also kind
of a different world.

19:12.443 --> 19:13.960
It is to some people.

19:15.946 --> 19:18.558
Liz, I'm sorry I didn't call.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.142
I meant to. It's just that I...

19:20.242 --> 19:23.479
You got all caught up in your new guy.
Been there, done that.

19:23.579 --> 19:26.607
- But you can't forget your girlfriends.
- I know.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.901
So how does it all work, Tory?

19:29.001 --> 19:31.279
I mean, a big banker
and a bounty hunter?

19:31.379 --> 19:33.698
Yeah, how does that work?

19:33.798 --> 19:34.907
It works fine.

19:37.968 --> 19:40.955
I'm not a bounty hunter anymore.
This is kind of a one-off.

19:41.055 --> 19:42.582
Oh, okay.

19:42.682 --> 19:46.168
Well, I hope this whole
visit isn't just a one-off.

19:46.268 --> 19:49.913
- It'd be nice to hang out with you again.
- For sure.

19:50.856 --> 19:52.133
Later, Mikey Boy.

19:52.233 --> 19:54.160
Over and out, Legs.

19:55.361 --> 19:57.880
Smile. Got it.

19:58.989 --> 20:01.767
I get why you don't wanna
hang out with me...

20:01.867 --> 20:05.688
- ...since I'm you're smoking-hot ex-boyfriend.
- Ha, ha, very funny.

20:05.788 --> 20:10.985
Thank you. There's a lot of people on this
side of the bridge who still care about you.

20:11.085 --> 20:15.356
You might wanna think about that while
you're so busy planning your new life.

20:54.211 --> 20:56.405
Worked like a charm.

21:05.181 --> 21:06.983
Good.

21:10.853 --> 21:12.004
What do you think?

21:12.104 --> 21:14.715
If he's in there, that service
door is his access point.

21:14.815 --> 21:17.176
No fugitive wants to be
far away from his vehicle.

21:17.276 --> 21:20.930
Gale, watch the front, I'm gonna take
the east exit. Two of you stay together.

21:21.030 --> 21:22.707
It could be a trap.

21:23.157 --> 21:24.800
Go.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.117
Really?

22:11.831 --> 22:15.135
Okay, that works too.

22:25.135 --> 22:27.028
They're here.

22:27.805 --> 22:29.857
Leopold.

22:30.349 --> 22:32.460
The girl is mine.

22:32.560 --> 22:34.828
You got it, boss.

23:07.011 --> 23:08.938
You hungry?

23:15.728 --> 23:17.029
Tory?

23:19.023 --> 23:20.800
Tory.

23:20.900 --> 23:23.919
I know you're here.
I used that app I showed you.

23:42.379 --> 23:43.656
Mike, 12 o'clock.

23:46.175 --> 23:47.476
All right.

23:57.686 --> 24:00.330
Did the bear just explode?

24:09.698 --> 24:10.891
Who's this guy?

24:10.991 --> 24:12.476
This?

24:15.287 --> 24:17.022
Dad, James.

24:17.122 --> 24:19.800
James, Dad.

24:21.627 --> 24:23.929
All right. Here we go.

24:26.340 --> 24:27.575
How is he?

24:27.675 --> 24:29.326
Delicious and fine.

24:29.426 --> 24:32.246
- It's just a bump.
- Thanks for the house call, Liz.

24:32.346 --> 24:36.492
- Nice having a nurse in your contacts, isn't it?
- Yeah.

24:37.059 --> 24:40.838
Liz, I'm sorry. I let so much
time pass between us.

24:40.938 --> 24:42.882
You were always a really good friend.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.550
I still am.

24:44.650 --> 24:48.625
- You should give me a test-drive sometime.
- You got it.

24:50.447 --> 24:54.468
So aside from Mr. Delicious,
what's so great in Manhattan?

24:55.035 --> 25:00.357
Well, in Manhattan, I can be Tory.

25:00.457 --> 25:03.193
In Trenton, everyone
sees me as "Tornado."

25:03.293 --> 25:05.738
It's like this role I fell
into that never ends.

25:05.838 --> 25:08.991
- I thought you loved being a bounty hunter?
- No, I do.

25:09.091 --> 25:10.784
I did. But...

25:10.884 --> 25:14.413
You know, I like the
other parts of me.

25:14.513 --> 25:17.249
You know, when I met James,
that's all he saw.

25:17.349 --> 25:20.461
It's the other parts of
me and it felt great.

25:20.561 --> 25:23.990
The guys here, they just
see me as one of the guys.

25:24.106 --> 25:25.841
One guy didn't.

25:25.941 --> 25:29.836
Oh, I guess I wanted an option
other than Mikey Muscles.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.081
I understand.

25:32.364 --> 25:33.974
All right. House call's over.

25:34.074 --> 25:36.843
- I've gotta get back to work.
- All right.

25:40.497 --> 25:42.549
Thanks again.

25:57.890 --> 26:01.835
Okay, I just need to make
a few little adjustments.

26:01.935 --> 26:03.837
What's she doing with Redneck Santa?

26:03.937 --> 26:06.298
I just want the place to look nice.

26:06.398 --> 26:09.218
- Honey, I worked for hours getting it just right.
- Okay.

26:09.318 --> 26:12.304
Okay. This stuff cannot
be in the house.

26:12.404 --> 26:13.973
What are you so worried about?

26:14.073 --> 26:16.546
He doesn't know about the...

26:16.992 --> 26:18.811
family business.

26:18.911 --> 26:23.717
- You didn't tell him we're bounty hunters?
- It never came up.

26:24.750 --> 26:26.276
I know, I know. It's just...

26:26.376 --> 26:30.197
James is not just another boyfriend.
He's from a whole different world.

26:30.297 --> 26:32.741
Mom, you know. You Googled him.

26:32.841 --> 26:34.702
Tornado Renee Bell...

26:34.802 --> 26:36.328
you can't hide yourself.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.914
She's not hiding herself.

26:39.014 --> 26:40.249
She's hiding us.

26:40.349 --> 26:42.126
I'm not hiding you.

26:42.226 --> 26:43.836
I love you guys.

26:43.936 --> 26:46.238
I do. It's just... Well...

26:46.605 --> 26:49.633
This would be a bit
of a shock for James.

26:49.733 --> 26:51.844
I just need to ease him into it.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.291
Please?

26:53.570 --> 26:56.965
Please, help me. Just play along.

26:57.282 --> 26:59.960
Okay, honey, okay. How?

27:00.285 --> 27:02.896
Just act normal.

27:02.996 --> 27:04.356
Can do.

27:04.456 --> 27:05.733
We got your back, Tor.

27:05.833 --> 27:08.101
Consider it done.

27:08.585 --> 27:10.762
What do you mean by "normal"?

27:11.004 --> 27:15.367
- Let's start by putting the girls away.
- Well, I'll try, but the girls aren't exactly shy.

27:15.467 --> 27:18.704
Okay, Ma, normal people
don't say things like that.

27:18.804 --> 27:20.414
Got it.

27:23.684 --> 27:26.032
Daddy?

27:26.812 --> 27:29.089
Do you have any sleeves?

27:30.399 --> 27:32.468
- Ain't doing it.
- Do it.

27:32.568 --> 27:35.387
- Done.
- Use mine.

27:35.487 --> 27:37.639
- Anything else, sweetie?
- JAMES:

27:37.739 --> 27:40.225
- Just act fancy.
- Oh.

27:40.325 --> 27:42.844
Act fancy.

27:43.078 --> 27:44.971
Oh.

27:48.667 --> 27:51.390
- Cracker?
- Cheese?

27:52.671 --> 27:54.564
Foot rub?

28:04.308 --> 28:07.753
- Sweetie.
- Oh, thank God.

28:07.853 --> 28:10.531
I thought I was...

28:10.689 --> 28:13.383
Did that cheese come out of a can?

28:13.483 --> 28:16.095
Honey, I am so glad
you're feeling better.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.930
You really hit your head hard.

28:18.030 --> 28:20.583
- I did?
- Yeah.

28:22.075 --> 28:24.093
Mom, Dad...

28:25.037 --> 28:26.589
cousin Bones...

28:27.039 --> 28:30.764
this is my boyfriend,
James Ballantine.

28:31.001 --> 28:32.111
Charmed.

28:35.464 --> 28:36.573
Oh.

28:36.673 --> 28:38.367
Nice to meet you all.

28:38.467 --> 28:42.613
Ha, ha. Oh, very festive tree.

28:43.263 --> 28:45.207
- And crossbow.
- I know, right?

28:45.307 --> 28:47.376
That was a wedding gift.

28:47.476 --> 28:49.198
My dear?

28:50.103 --> 28:52.622
Don't mind if I do.

28:56.735 --> 28:57.928
Libation.

28:58.028 --> 29:00.472
You know, I think James
should rest some more.

29:00.572 --> 29:03.559
No, no, no. Really, I'm fine.

29:03.659 --> 29:06.687
So I've never been to this part
of New Jersey. It's very...

29:16.213 --> 29:17.560
Is that a weapon?

29:18.423 --> 29:20.566
It's just a stun gun.

29:20.968 --> 29:22.953
For a little peace of mind, you know.

29:23.053 --> 29:26.081
Criminals always come to the
nice side of town to steal.

29:26.181 --> 29:27.624
Right. Of course.

29:27.724 --> 29:29.334
<i>Got one in sight...</i>

29:29.434 --> 29:31.987
Not to worry,
that's just my police scanner.

29:33.188 --> 29:35.424
Computer game, that I play nonstop.

29:35.524 --> 29:36.842
That's why it's always on.

29:36.942 --> 29:39.928
Oh, you're a gamer?
At work, I have "ExcelTetra."

29:40.028 --> 29:41.750
No way. Which version?

29:42.114 --> 29:43.515
Five.

29:45.617 --> 29:48.979
Wow, that's impressive.

29:49.079 --> 29:50.981
See? We're all getting
along so well. Ha-ha-ha.

29:51.081 --> 29:54.359
Yes, we are, Mrs. Bell.
And I am so happy about that...

29:54.459 --> 29:57.763
because I actually came
here to speak to Mr. Bell.

29:58.463 --> 30:00.265
- Me?
- Yes.

30:01.049 --> 30:02.868
I know you don't know
much about me...

30:02.968 --> 30:05.662
and that I haven't been
dating Tory for very long.

30:05.762 --> 30:08.540
So your mind must be
filled with questions.

30:08.640 --> 30:09.917
Who is this man?

30:10.017 --> 30:11.543
What does he stand for?

30:11.643 --> 30:13.086
Where is he from?

30:16.523 --> 30:19.622
My names is James
Oswald Ballantine III.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.220
- Fancy.
- Mom.

30:21.320 --> 30:24.431
I come from the Upper
East Side of Manhattan.

30:24.531 --> 30:28.131
And I stand for whatever
makes Tory happy.

30:28.493 --> 30:30.354
Oh! my.

30:30.454 --> 30:31.730
I know you feel protective.

30:31.830 --> 30:35.350
Protective? You obviously haven't
seen my girl choke someone out.

30:35.667 --> 30:37.778
Up. Choke someone up.

30:37.878 --> 30:40.113
With emotion.

30:40.213 --> 30:42.491
- Tory's got a lot of heart.
- A crazy amount.

30:42.591 --> 30:44.313
- Yeah.
- I know.

30:45.510 --> 30:49.498
And that's why the real reason
I came here today, Mr. Bell...

30:49.598 --> 30:52.196
was to ask your permission...

30:53.352 --> 30:55.495
to propose to your daughter.

31:03.695 --> 31:08.171
- What did I miss?
- Tory's getting married!

31:41.983 --> 31:45.412
- That's some ring you got her.
- Well, she's worth it.

31:50.700 --> 31:53.478
Well, I didn't unscrew the
good stuff for nothing.

31:53.578 --> 31:55.147
Let's celebrate.

31:55.247 --> 31:59.051
- I say we take this party to Bochino's.
- Oh, you were banned from there.

31:59.334 --> 32:01.432
Oh, yeah.

32:01.837 --> 32:04.811
- Bochino's sounds good.
- But don't we have work to do?

32:05.215 --> 32:06.491
Serious work?

32:06.591 --> 32:10.245
Tory, you gotta celebrate tonight.
This is everything you've ever wanted.

32:10.345 --> 32:14.115
- But I don't have clothes for Bochino's.
- Of course she does.

32:14.266 --> 32:16.585
But, honey...

32:16.685 --> 32:19.963
- Bochino's is kind of a dive.
- Oh.

32:20.063 --> 32:23.925
- Oh, your favorite bar is suddenly "a dive"?
- A dive bar? Really?

32:24.025 --> 32:27.763
Good, because I can't tell you
how sick I am of Crystal.

32:29.072 --> 32:30.307
I know, I know.

32:30.407 --> 32:31.924
You and me both, right?

32:32.826 --> 32:35.254
- What is that?
- Ma, help me get dressed.

32:35.579 --> 32:37.096
Okay.

32:38.623 --> 32:39.924
So you like the ring?

32:42.961 --> 32:45.280
Hello, Jersey.

32:45.380 --> 32:46.806
I know, right?

32:46.965 --> 32:48.700
I picked out all of your faves.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.147
So many choices.

32:50.510 --> 32:52.608
And so little time.

32:57.142 --> 32:58.668
- Help with your hair?
- Oh.

32:58.768 --> 33:00.786
Not tonight, Ma.

33:01.730 --> 33:03.715
I know it's not quite your style.

33:03.815 --> 33:06.093
Me, I'd say it needs more gold.

33:06.193 --> 33:08.220
But it's nice.

33:08.320 --> 33:11.723
Thanks, Mom. For trying
so hard with James.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.625
Well...

33:14.993 --> 33:16.812
You got what you wanted, Tory.

33:16.912 --> 33:20.466
A new life in Manhattan.

33:21.791 --> 33:24.653
You're always gonna
be my little girl.

33:24.753 --> 33:27.431
And I'm gonna miss you.

33:28.173 --> 33:30.534
But I'm so happy for you.

33:30.634 --> 33:32.607
Thanks, Ma.

33:37.182 --> 33:41.253
Tory, if you wanna go back to
New York with James, we get it.

33:41.353 --> 33:44.464
Between us and Mike,
we can handle Manucci.

33:44.564 --> 33:46.883
No. I put Manucci
away the first time.

33:46.983 --> 33:49.052
He's back because of me.

33:49.152 --> 33:52.126
And I'm gonna put him
away the second time too.

33:57.577 --> 34:01.472
Like it or not, you're a Bell.

34:09.965 --> 34:11.766
Okay.

34:15.594 --> 34:17.496
Welcome back.

34:24.396 --> 34:26.130
Oh, my God.

34:26.231 --> 34:28.507
Tory, that's like the
Taj Mahal of rocks!

34:28.608 --> 34:31.261
Heh. James, this is Nurse Sembrook.

34:31.360 --> 34:34.054
But I've known her my entire
life as Lizzie the Legs.

34:34.155 --> 34:39.603
- You can use Elizabeth if it feels better to you.
- No way. I much prefer Lizzie the Legs.

34:39.703 --> 34:41.755
Oh, he's so cute, I could just spazz.

34:41.913 --> 34:44.466
Mikey Muscles, what brings you by?

34:44.833 --> 34:48.056
I just missed the big moment.
I couldn't miss the celebration.

34:48.295 --> 34:50.237
- Mike.
- Yeah, Tory.

34:50.338 --> 34:53.437
Don't take it personally.
Exes are like that.

34:54.967 --> 34:59.398
And by exes I just meant...
I'm gonna stop now.

34:59.764 --> 35:01.625
- Do you need to use the bathroom?
- No.

35:01.725 --> 35:03.322
Yes, you do.

35:05.520 --> 35:06.912
You dated him?

35:07.606 --> 35:08.924
Young and dumb.

35:09.024 --> 35:11.009
Well, how long did you guys go out?

35:11.109 --> 35:15.255
Oh, I wouldn't even call it going out.
It was over before it began.

35:15.739 --> 35:18.391
He used to work for my
dad and... You know.

35:18.491 --> 35:19.935
- Right. Right.
- Yeah.

35:20.035 --> 35:22.354
Tory, what kind of
business is your dad in?

35:22.454 --> 35:25.607
When you mentioned that your father
was a businessman, I pictured...

35:25.707 --> 35:29.110
James, I want to explain
it all to you. And I will.

35:29.210 --> 35:33.490
But it's a little complicated. And I
just want to do it at the right time.

35:33.590 --> 35:38.111
Honey, can we please
just celebrate tonight?

35:38.428 --> 35:40.605
Yes.

35:41.306 --> 35:43.458
- Aw.
- Oop.

35:43.558 --> 35:45.835
Sorry, Tor. I figured
you told him about Mike.

35:45.935 --> 35:49.422
I was going to,
but this thing came up.

35:49.522 --> 35:51.758
Plus, Mike and I are done. It's over.

35:51.858 --> 35:53.510
If you say so.

35:53.610 --> 35:55.053
Come on, lose the coat, girl.

35:55.153 --> 35:57.764
Oh, no, no. It's fine.
I think I'll keep it on.

35:57.864 --> 36:00.132
Come on, Tor, you gotta move.

36:00.325 --> 36:03.003
Come on, Bell, dance!

36:04.245 --> 36:06.639
You look gorge!

36:09.751 --> 36:12.145
Now you're talking!

36:16.383 --> 36:18.159
How long have you known Tory?

36:18.259 --> 36:20.311
Since junior high. You?

36:21.554 --> 36:23.026
Ten months.

36:23.306 --> 36:24.499
Ten months.

36:24.599 --> 36:26.376
Dude doesn't waste any time.

36:26.476 --> 36:29.129
Well, when it's meant
to be, it's meant to be.

36:29.229 --> 36:31.047
What are you drinking?

36:31.147 --> 36:34.917
Well, I think champagne
is appropriate.

36:35.110 --> 36:37.596
Can I get a champagne
for my friend and a...?

36:37.696 --> 36:39.498
A shot and beer chaser?

36:39.656 --> 36:41.308
How'd you guess?

36:41.408 --> 36:43.018
Actually, forget the champagne.

36:43.118 --> 36:44.436
I'll have what he's having.

36:44.536 --> 36:47.555
A shot and a beer chaser.

36:49.165 --> 36:53.069
Aw. Looks like your ex and
your man are getting along.

36:53.169 --> 36:54.516
Oh, shoot.

36:56.005 --> 36:57.522
Help me.

36:58.633 --> 37:00.526
So, what do you do?

37:01.761 --> 37:06.692
Well, we look for companies that are
in trouble and we acquire them.

37:07.183 --> 37:11.046
Sounds like we're in the same business,
except we find people in trouble and we...

37:11.146 --> 37:14.620
Stop it! Stop being such guys and
get your butts on the dance floor.

37:15.442 --> 37:17.135
I'm waiting on a shot.

37:17.235 --> 37:19.554
And a beer chaser.

37:19.654 --> 37:22.432
I'll go easy on you because
it's your first night tonight.

37:22.532 --> 37:24.550
Muscles, don't make me play hard.

37:24.909 --> 37:26.686
You win, Legs.

37:26.786 --> 37:28.759
Here you go.

37:31.416 --> 37:33.309
Thank you.

37:34.294 --> 37:36.722
Pookie! Hi!

37:42.635 --> 37:44.621
- Hi.
- Hi.

37:44.721 --> 37:46.068
- Whoo.
- Heh.

37:48.475 --> 37:50.402
- Nice work today.
- You too.

37:57.734 --> 37:59.427
Okay, should we talk?

37:59.527 --> 38:01.513
- About what?
- Well...

38:01.613 --> 38:04.349
Three years later, you're engaged,
and now you wanna talk?

38:04.449 --> 38:08.174
You know when I wanted to talk?
Before you ditched me and left town.

38:08.411 --> 38:10.230
I know I didn't handle it well.

38:10.330 --> 38:13.024
But, Mike, it wasn't anything
you did. It was me.

38:13.124 --> 38:16.528
Wow, that's what it
feels like to hear that.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.029
What?

38:18.129 --> 38:21.649
"It's not you, it's me." I've used
that line a few times myself.

38:23.301 --> 38:24.602
Have a nice night.

38:27.680 --> 38:30.750
- Hey.
- Hey, I haven't danced in quite a while.

38:30.850 --> 38:32.961
Oh, you're pretty good.

38:33.061 --> 38:36.214
- No, Tor, I'm inspired.
- Aw.

38:39.609 --> 38:43.459
<i>You know tonight is the night
You got me feeling good</i>

38:43.655 --> 38:46.015
Hey, Tory!

38:46.115 --> 38:48.893
You up for a shot and a beer chaser?

38:48.993 --> 38:50.520
It's pretty good.

38:50.620 --> 38:52.672
Sure.

38:52.997 --> 38:55.650
Come on, future
Mrs. Delicious, let's toast.

38:55.750 --> 38:58.653
- You snagged a good one.
- Yeah, I know. James is amazing.

38:58.753 --> 39:00.613
It's hard to celebrate
with Mike here.

39:00.713 --> 39:03.366
Oh, come on, you can't expect
Mikey to be happy tonight.

39:03.466 --> 39:05.243
He's been hung up on you for years.

39:05.343 --> 39:08.163
- But he'll get over it.
- Years?

39:08.263 --> 39:10.415
He hasn't had a girlfriend
since you left.

39:10.515 --> 39:12.959
A guy who looks like that?
You do the math.

39:13.059 --> 39:14.669
But he'll get over you.

39:14.769 --> 39:16.629
If you let him.

39:16.729 --> 39:18.548
<i>Now come here
Tell me whatcha think, girl</i>

39:18.648 --> 39:22.260
<i>You know tonight is the night
You got me feeling good</i>

39:22.360 --> 39:27.166
<i>We must be doing it right
Got me feeling good</i>

39:27.365 --> 39:30.214
Whoo! Party.

39:31.244 --> 39:34.606
- I know you think I didn't care about you.
- Don't tell me what I think.

39:34.706 --> 39:37.984
- You don't understand why I...
- Don't tell me what I don't understand.

39:38.084 --> 39:40.987
Let's not make this any more
difficult than it already is.

39:41.087 --> 39:44.266
Difficult? For you or the
guy you left behind?

39:47.385 --> 39:50.205
Tory, what you don't understand is...

39:50.305 --> 39:52.323
I love you.

39:54.142 --> 39:56.240
Loved.

39:56.686 --> 39:58.579
Past tense, right?

39:59.397 --> 40:02.701
Past, present...

40:03.568 --> 40:05.245
future.

40:10.783 --> 40:12.710
I'm engaged.

40:12.994 --> 40:16.439
<i>We've been doing it right
You've got me feeling good</i>

40:16.539 --> 40:20.059
<i>Hands up
I wanna see your hands right now</i>

40:31.638 --> 40:34.407
You've been holding out on me.

40:35.141 --> 40:37.001
You're an incredible dancer.

40:37.101 --> 40:40.120
Come on, I wanna see some more moves.

40:57.163 --> 41:00.525
- What are you doing with those?
- Oh, just reminiscing.

41:00.625 --> 41:03.849
Gosh, our lives are
really crazy, but fun.

41:04.963 --> 41:08.992
- Remember that Christmas in Key West?
- That was the best Christmas ever.

41:09.092 --> 41:11.986
- We nabbed Tommy Franklin.
- Yeah.

41:12.136 --> 41:13.204
Dewey Beach.

41:13.304 --> 41:16.082
When Hawk and Gale
collared Cole Harper.

41:16.182 --> 41:18.960
Wasn't that the first
time you used a stun gun?

41:19.060 --> 41:20.782
Yep.

41:22.271 --> 41:28.453
Do you think I can be a normal
wife with a normal family?

41:29.278 --> 41:31.848
I think you can be anything
you wanna be, Tor.

41:31.948 --> 41:34.000
We all do.

41:35.660 --> 41:37.270
Mike called. He got a tip.

41:37.370 --> 41:41.399
- Manucci will be at the Cliff Street lot tonight.
- Where they sell Christmas trees?

41:41.499 --> 41:42.692
- Yep.
- Let's roll.

41:42.792 --> 41:45.720
Come on, let's stake it out.

41:48.381 --> 41:50.399
Maybe someday, honey.

41:57.932 --> 42:00.293
- Where is everyone?
- They went out.

42:00.393 --> 42:02.003
Out? Where?

42:02.103 --> 42:03.880
To the Christmas tree lot.

42:03.980 --> 42:07.910
In case Auntie got sick of hers.

42:08.109 --> 42:11.387
Oh. Well, shouldn't we
have gone with them?

42:11.487 --> 42:13.806
I mean, shouldn't we
help pick out the tree?

42:13.906 --> 42:17.685
I prefer to stay here,
in case the phone rings.

42:17.785 --> 42:21.230
- You're the desk guy.
- Exactly.

42:21.330 --> 42:24.429
Besides Mike is with them and
he can help them with the tree.

42:25.710 --> 42:27.946
- Mike is with them?
- Yeah.

42:28.046 --> 42:30.565
He's a pretty strong guy.

42:32.592 --> 42:35.578
You know, I'm a desk guy too.

42:35.678 --> 42:39.248
And, heh, sometimes I
get really sick of it.

42:39.348 --> 42:41.366
Tell me about it.

42:41.559 --> 42:46.786
Don't you ever wish you can just say
"screw the rules" and follow your passion?

42:47.690 --> 42:51.177
- You have no idea.
- Let's go.

42:51.277 --> 42:55.081
- Let's go chop down a tree.
- Yes!

42:55.239 --> 42:57.758
Come on!

43:15.093 --> 43:16.494
Tory!

43:16.594 --> 43:18.237
Hey!

43:18.387 --> 43:21.708
James. Honey,
what are you doing here?

43:21.808 --> 43:25.336
- Yeah, what are you doing here?
- James and I aren't desk guys.

43:25.436 --> 43:27.113
Have you lost your mind?

43:27.563 --> 43:28.756
A little, I'm sorry.

43:28.856 --> 43:31.409
We both wanted to help pick out the tree.

43:31.567 --> 43:32.885
Huh?

43:32.985 --> 43:34.470
I mean, I...

43:34.570 --> 43:38.933
Honey, I wanted to surprise you with
what will be our first Christmas tree...

43:39.033 --> 43:40.977
to hang my crystal angel on.

43:41.077 --> 43:44.772
Oh, well, a family should
pick out their tree together.

43:44.872 --> 43:46.298
Where do we start?

43:48.376 --> 43:51.145
Daddy, where do we start?

43:51.295 --> 43:53.573
Well, Gale's gonna wait by the car...

43:53.673 --> 43:55.825
- ...to make sure that it keeps running.
- Yeah.

43:55.925 --> 44:01.122
And, Tory and Mike, why don't
you check around that trailer...

44:01.222 --> 44:03.207
see if you find anyone.

44:03.307 --> 44:04.654
Bones and James...

44:04.809 --> 44:08.629
take the far, far,
far east end of the lot.

44:08.729 --> 44:10.827
- Far.
- Great trees there.

44:10.982 --> 44:13.885
Wow, sir, you take your
tree shopping seriously.

44:13.985 --> 44:16.083
I do.

44:16.320 --> 44:18.622
Deadly serious.

44:18.739 --> 44:20.541
Now go!

44:22.493 --> 44:24.395
Be careful!

44:24.495 --> 44:26.564
It's a tree lot in Trenton, Tory.

44:26.664 --> 44:29.092
Not the Black Forest.

44:29.500 --> 44:30.972
I love you.

44:43.723 --> 44:46.667
Mike, if anything goes wrong,
I've got to watch out for James.

44:46.767 --> 44:48.044
Will you help me?

44:48.144 --> 44:49.378
Really?

44:49.478 --> 44:53.578
You're really asking if I'll
help protect your fiance?

44:53.816 --> 44:57.211
Sure. I'm just your partner.

45:09.290 --> 45:10.887
Manucci is here for sure.

45:11.042 --> 45:14.937
Okay, you get him,
I'll look for Manucci.

45:35.983 --> 45:39.720
Now, I'm almost sad
to see this end, Bell.

45:39.820 --> 45:41.347
Almost.

45:41.447 --> 45:42.794
Goodbye.

45:48.579 --> 45:50.773
- What was that?
- Sounded like a .38.

45:50.873 --> 45:51.983
Yeah, right.

45:55.127 --> 45:58.977
Get off of me, you little
spider monkey. Come on!

46:05.012 --> 46:07.735
Are you kidding me?

46:28.160 --> 46:30.633
Yeah, I got this boss. I got this.

46:43.175 --> 46:47.901
- I didn't know Manhattan socialites can fight.
- I'm not a Manhattan socialite.

46:48.514 --> 46:50.361
Yet.

46:52.560 --> 46:53.836
Let's go! Let's go!

47:03.321 --> 47:05.014
- Tory?
- James, get down!

47:05.114 --> 47:08.042
- Why are you holding a gun?
- Because I'm...

47:08.159 --> 47:09.810
a bounty hunter! Get down!

47:09.910 --> 47:11.883
A what? A what?

47:12.872 --> 47:15.140
- No, Tory!
- James!

47:19.170 --> 47:20.471
Daddy!

47:21.213 --> 47:23.481
- Daddy? Daddy, are you okay?
- Oh. I'm okay.

47:27.053 --> 47:28.696
Go with Mike.

47:39.523 --> 47:42.827
- I can't believe I got James into this.
- It's not your fault.

47:45.112 --> 47:47.139
He poked his head out
from behind the tree.

47:47.239 --> 47:49.132
Mike.

47:50.034 --> 47:51.894
Seriously, who hears gunshots...

47:51.994 --> 47:54.342
- ...and pokes their head out?
- Mike.

47:56.624 --> 47:59.860
- Don't most people hit the deck?
- He's not one of us, okay?

47:59.960 --> 48:02.183
Okay. I didn't mean anything by it.

48:19.897 --> 48:23.050
"Hey, bad guy with a gun.
I'm over here, shoot me."

48:23.150 --> 48:24.952
Psh-psh. Ouch!

48:43.754 --> 48:45.727
Damn it!

48:55.850 --> 48:58.198
This is my fault.

48:58.477 --> 49:01.451
He shouldn't even be here.

49:05.359 --> 49:07.377
Listen to me.

49:07.611 --> 49:10.264
We're gonna get him
back for you, okay?

49:10.364 --> 49:13.588
You're gonna get married and
it's all gonna be good. Okay?

49:15.661 --> 49:17.588
Thanks.

49:17.705 --> 49:19.757
They're not gonna hurt him.

49:20.124 --> 49:21.767
It's you they want.

49:24.420 --> 49:26.238
Wow, thanks.

49:26.338 --> 49:28.606
- I didn't mean it like that.
- No, really...

49:28.841 --> 49:31.985
thanks. You're right. I'm good now.

49:41.937 --> 49:44.757
Manucci is gonna lay down
low like the rat that he is.

49:44.857 --> 49:47.760
But with a hostage,
he's gonna need a solid base.

49:47.860 --> 49:51.555
If the tracking device is in Big Donna's
pocket, I could try to reactivate it.

49:51.655 --> 49:53.224
Good thinking.

49:53.324 --> 49:55.684
Hey, guys!

49:55.784 --> 49:58.187
Look who snagged the end
of the shift doughnuts.

49:58.287 --> 50:00.272
Any takers?

50:00.372 --> 50:01.899
Everyone okay?

50:01.999 --> 50:03.275
Manucci got James.

50:03.375 --> 50:05.069
Oh, snap.

50:05.169 --> 50:09.315
Could you imagine how much that boy
must be freaking out? That dude's scary.

50:11.675 --> 50:13.067
I'm shutting up now.

50:15.054 --> 50:17.331
I don't know what to do, Dad.

50:17.431 --> 50:18.666
If James gets hurt...

50:18.766 --> 50:20.584
The Tory I know...

50:20.684 --> 50:24.922
knows exactly what to do.
She knows how to catch a criminal.

50:25.022 --> 50:28.121
And probably save a fiancé too.

50:30.319 --> 50:35.090
You got him once, Tory. You can
do it again. Come on, Bells, think.

50:38.536 --> 50:39.854
Oh, my...

50:39.954 --> 50:41.346
What is it, Tory?

50:42.873 --> 50:44.846
White rhinestone heels...

50:45.668 --> 50:48.988
facial wax, extensions, spray tan.

50:49.088 --> 50:50.514
Prom?

50:51.840 --> 50:53.451
White glittery gazebo.

50:53.551 --> 50:56.662
- Oh, my God. A Jersey wedding.
- A Jersey wedding.

50:56.762 --> 50:59.832
- Big Donna's getting married.
- Probably gonna be a big wedding.

50:59.932 --> 51:02.030
Because Big Donna's...

51:04.019 --> 51:05.366
big.

51:06.564 --> 51:08.549
- What we have to figure out is...
- Where.

51:08.649 --> 51:12.845
- That's where we'll get Manucci and James.
- I know the location. It's at the warehouse.

51:12.945 --> 51:15.806
I saw the gazebo. Nobody moves
a gazebo once it's built.

51:15.906 --> 51:17.378
But when is the wedding?

51:17.533 --> 51:19.810
When did she get a spray tan?

51:19.910 --> 51:21.437
Two days ago.

51:21.537 --> 51:23.230
Spray tan goes streaky in...

51:23.330 --> 51:26.400
- Seventy two hours. It's tomorrow.
- It's tomorrow.

51:26.500 --> 51:27.985
Bones, find plans on the warehouse.

51:29.253 --> 51:31.822
I need points of entry, passageways,
underground, everything.

51:31.922 --> 51:33.565
Okay.

51:33.757 --> 51:35.149
What is it, Tory?

51:35.926 --> 51:38.274
Our invitation.

51:42.099 --> 51:44.572
I need a doughnut.

52:19.011 --> 52:21.985
You look beautiful, Donna.

52:22.181 --> 52:24.208
- That makes two of us.
- Huh?

52:25.934 --> 52:28.879
It means a lot that you came
back to Jersey for this.

52:28.979 --> 52:32.716
I wanted at least one family member
at my wedding and everyone else is...

52:32.816 --> 52:34.459
- ...dead.
- Dead.

52:35.152 --> 52:37.012
- Or in prison.
- Or in prison. Heh.

52:37.112 --> 52:40.516
Look, I wouldn't have
missed this for anything.

52:40.616 --> 52:44.353
I mean, it's not every day you
see your little sister get married.

52:44.453 --> 52:45.879
No, it's not.

52:46.497 --> 52:47.856
You know, but...

52:47.956 --> 52:51.402
I know this isn't exactly how you
pictured your wedding day...

52:51.502 --> 52:54.738
- but I can't risk being seen...
- I know, being seen in public.

52:54.838 --> 52:56.481
I know.

52:56.965 --> 53:00.895
Do you think we would have been
happier if we'd have gone straight?

53:03.972 --> 53:06.625
- No. Absolutely not.
- No way.

53:09.436 --> 53:11.488
Now, remember...

53:12.022 --> 53:14.466
this is my day, okay?

53:14.566 --> 53:16.510
No funny stuff...

53:16.610 --> 53:19.004
no guns, no business.

53:19.154 --> 53:22.725
You think I'm dumb enough to
mess with a girl's wedding? Heh.

53:22.825 --> 53:25.002
Even I'm afraid of that.

53:33.210 --> 53:37.265
- That's exactly what happened.
- Yeah, right here.

53:50.811 --> 53:52.713
- Yeah.
- I don't know, she got...

53:52.813 --> 53:55.536
- Oh, really?
- Come on.

53:57.985 --> 54:00.304
- Is the perimeter secure?
<i>- East end secure.</i>

54:00.404 --> 54:02.473
<i>- South, secure.</i>
- Bones, any building plans?

54:02.573 --> 54:05.434
<i>- Working on it.</i>
- Work faster.

54:05.534 --> 54:08.383
You're sexy when you're bossy.

54:08.912 --> 54:12.261
- Good to see you.
- Great to see you. So glad you could make it.

54:15.711 --> 54:19.782
Oh, it is my honor, my friend.
It is my honor?

54:19.882 --> 54:22.493
Look at you. Who let you in?

54:22.593 --> 54:24.745
Two beautiful women.

54:24.845 --> 54:27.206
- What does he got that I don't got?
- Yeah.

54:27.306 --> 54:29.074
Share the wealth.

54:29.808 --> 54:32.236
Good to see you. Good to see you.

54:33.937 --> 54:35.589
They're here.

54:35.689 --> 54:38.717
Good. Glad they could make it.

54:38.817 --> 54:40.219
- Try the shrimp.
- Definitely.

54:45.240 --> 54:46.642
Where is the shrimp?

54:46.742 --> 54:50.396
How am I supposed to rescue
him if I don't know where he is?

54:50.496 --> 54:52.798
Wait a sec.

54:53.123 --> 54:54.358
You're gonna call him?

54:54.458 --> 54:57.986
I'm gonna track where he was.
Obviously, Manucci took his phone.

54:58.086 --> 55:01.407
But if we can find it,
James will be nearby.

55:07.179 --> 55:10.323
This does it for you?

55:12.309 --> 55:13.919
He's close. Black Hawk...

55:14.019 --> 55:16.130
<i>- ...I see where James is.</i>
- Great.

55:16.230 --> 55:19.007
<i>Northwest corner.
I can't tell which room.</i>

55:19.107 --> 55:20.217
Hold up.

55:20.317 --> 55:21.914
<i>Hold up.</i>

55:26.281 --> 55:27.641
Check out the crowd.

55:27.741 --> 55:28.892
What is it?

55:28.992 --> 55:32.512
Ho, ho, ho, and a Merry
Christmas to the Bell family.

55:34.998 --> 55:37.860
<i>All of these guys have
outstanding bounties on them.</i>

55:37.960 --> 55:39.737
Oh! my.

55:39.837 --> 55:42.310
- Yeah, I'm a happy guy.
- Yeah.

55:42.714 --> 55:46.326
Bobby Waves, $20,000.

55:46.426 --> 55:49.580
Sticks Kaczmareck, 30,000.

55:49.680 --> 55:55.237
Oh, if we play our cards right, this is going
to be a very bountiful Christmas for the Bells.

55:55.853 --> 55:58.255
Okay, fine, but stay focused here.

55:58.355 --> 56:01.175
James first, Manucci second.

56:01.275 --> 56:03.927
Then you guys can have
your holiday shopping spree.

56:04.027 --> 56:06.805
Roger that. Banshee-1,
I'll see you at the east exit.

56:06.905 --> 56:09.207
Not if I see you first.

56:58.081 --> 56:59.316
Should have been in here.

57:01.293 --> 57:03.641
They had him here.

57:05.297 --> 57:07.825
There's got to be another
concealed space close by.

57:07.925 --> 57:11.900
You actually thought I'd be dumb
enough to let him keep his phone?

57:12.179 --> 57:14.106
I'm insulted.

57:21.855 --> 57:23.532
Get down! Get down! Get down!

57:25.859 --> 57:28.628
Are you freaking kidding me?

57:39.206 --> 57:42.180
Pardon me. It's just a small caliber.

57:43.794 --> 57:44.903
Sorry about that.

57:45.003 --> 57:47.021
Oh, boy.

57:49.132 --> 57:52.185
I told him no funny
stuff at my wedding.

58:03.146 --> 58:05.869
My brother's a dead man.

58:34.594 --> 58:37.818
- He's heading that way.
- Find James. I got this.

59:10.380 --> 59:12.307
What's your name?

59:25.312 --> 59:27.130
Sorry. Exit's closed.

59:27.230 --> 59:30.033
Stick around. It's almost cake time.

59:30.650 --> 59:32.918
How's the shrimp? Yummy?

01:00:55.944 --> 01:00:57.291
It's been fun.

01:01:18.425 --> 01:01:20.147
Freeze!

01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:22.654
It's over, Manucci.

01:01:22.929 --> 01:01:24.247
Yeah, Bell.

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:28.293
It finally is over.

01:01:42.866 --> 01:01:44.964
Let him go.

01:01:45.744 --> 01:01:48.438
Let's make a deal, Bell.

01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:51.191
I mean, after all,
Prince Charming over here...

01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:53.610
he's not the one who caught me...

01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:55.762
and sent me away for six years.

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:59.057
What are you proposing?

01:01:59.174 --> 01:02:01.576
I let him go.

01:02:01.676 --> 01:02:03.245
And you...

01:02:03.345 --> 01:02:04.988
well...

01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:09.117
you come with me.

01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:15.924
Tory, or whoever you actually are...

01:02:16.024 --> 01:02:17.871
don't.

01:02:29.246 --> 01:02:31.231
Yeah.

01:02:31.331 --> 01:02:34.134
Yeah, that's a good Bell?

01:02:35.627 --> 01:02:37.554
Chin up.

01:02:56.273 --> 01:02:57.665
It's going to be okay.

01:02:58.233 --> 01:02:59.634
Just try and stay calm.

01:02:59.734 --> 01:03:01.553
Please, calm is my middle name.

01:03:01.653 --> 01:03:03.955
Or sort of calm.

01:03:06.157 --> 01:03:08.185
Three fingers, duck.

01:03:08.285 --> 01:03:10.087
What?

01:03:25.552 --> 01:03:27.570
Oh!

01:03:32.767 --> 01:03:34.819
Oh!

01:03:36.146 --> 01:03:38.164
Tory, baby.

01:03:39.983 --> 01:03:42.081
Tory, are you okay?

01:03:43.403 --> 01:03:47.333
- Okay, James, stay right here. Don't move.
- No, no, no. Tory!

01:04:07.635 --> 01:04:10.404
Open the door. Open the door.

01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:14.492
Do it!

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:27.748
Hey! Watch out!

01:04:43.254 --> 01:04:46.524
- Come on.
- Go. I'm right behind you.

01:05:05.527 --> 01:05:07.887
- She's good.
- She's really good.

01:05:07.987 --> 01:05:10.255
She's a Bell.

01:05:23.253 --> 01:05:26.432
Hey, watch your head.

01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:32.787
Escaped convict with a new
attempted-murder charge.

01:05:32.887 --> 01:05:35.665
He's not gonna see the light
of day for a long time.

01:05:35.765 --> 01:05:37.959
You're amazing, Tory.

01:05:38.059 --> 01:05:40.453
But you probably already know that.

01:05:40.854 --> 01:05:42.130
I do.

01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:43.590
But you can tell me anyway.

01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:45.342
I could tell you.

01:05:45.442 --> 01:05:49.763
I could stand here and tell you all day
that every time I see you or talk to you...

01:05:49.863 --> 01:05:52.837
it's as exciting as the
first time I saw you.

01:05:53.658 --> 01:05:55.602
How I love watching you fight...

01:05:55.702 --> 01:06:00.303
but I also love watching you
walk and talk and just be.

01:06:01.458 --> 01:06:03.777
But there's another guy
who wants to do that.

01:06:03.877 --> 01:06:06.529
A great guy who can
give you a good life.

01:06:06.629 --> 01:06:09.557
The new life you wanted so much.

01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:13.561
Lizzie keeps telling
me how you've changed.

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:15.121
She's right.

01:06:15.221 --> 01:06:17.290
There is something
different about you now.

01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:18.750
I'm even more handsome?

01:06:20.435 --> 01:06:22.337
What changed, Tory, is you.

01:06:22.437 --> 01:06:26.549
You left and I realized you needed more than
just Mike Muscles, although he was fine.

01:06:26.649 --> 01:06:28.385
In your eyes.

01:06:30.361 --> 01:06:33.181
So I took some courses at college.

01:06:33.281 --> 01:06:34.516
I'm pre-law now.

01:06:34.616 --> 01:06:35.725
Get out!

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:38.561
Word of honor. Losing you changed me.

01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:44.692
So maybe the next beautiful, smart, motivated
butt-kicker that walks into my life...

01:06:44.792 --> 01:06:47.015
will have a reason...

01:06:47.629 --> 01:06:49.055
to stay.

01:07:04.103 --> 01:07:05.871
Your guy's waiting.

01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:23.148
My hero.

01:07:24.415 --> 01:07:26.843
You okay?

01:07:27.585 --> 01:07:32.657
So crazy, but I thought you meeting
my family was the big hurdle.

01:07:35.385 --> 01:07:39.940
- I should have never lied to you.
- No, you shouldn't have.

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:43.835
Because I can't help but wonder
what else wasn't true, Tory.

01:07:43.935 --> 01:07:46.613
Your name is Tory, right?

01:07:47.105 --> 01:07:49.157
I'm sorry.

01:07:49.274 --> 01:07:52.469
If I was just honest with you,
none of this would have happened.

01:07:52.569 --> 01:07:54.762
You wouldn't have been knocked out...

01:07:54.862 --> 01:07:58.183
Well, that's actually happened
before on the slopes of Chamonix.

01:07:58.283 --> 01:08:01.394
- You would have never been zapped.
- That was a first.

01:08:01.494 --> 01:08:04.105
- Kidnapped.
- Ditto.

01:08:04.205 --> 01:08:05.773
But it was kind of a rush.

01:08:09.627 --> 01:08:13.239
I just wish you'd give me a
chance to love the real you...

01:08:13.339 --> 01:08:15.158
because...

01:08:15.258 --> 01:08:20.064
the woman I met in New York
and the woman I met here...

01:08:21.389 --> 01:08:23.157
they're both pretty amazing.

01:08:24.517 --> 01:08:28.117
So now that all three
of us have met...

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:30.455
can we try again?

01:08:32.483 --> 01:08:37.764
A big part of me wants to say yes...

01:08:37.863 --> 01:08:42.352
but in these last few
days I've learned...

01:08:42.452 --> 01:08:46.801
an even bigger part of me realized...

01:08:47.081 --> 01:08:52.529
I'm still a bounty-hunting,
criminal-collaring...

01:08:52.629 --> 01:08:55.682
occasional animal-print-wearing
Jersey girl.

01:09:03.473 --> 01:09:05.696
Well, I'm gonna
miss you, Jersey girl.

01:09:22.575 --> 01:09:24.421
Sit.

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:36.022
Bell. What the-J?

01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:47.500
Welcome back to Jersey.

01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:59.804
Okay. Attention, attention.

01:10:01.364 --> 01:10:04.338
I just wanna say
"welcome home" to my girl.

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:07.145
We love you and we missed you...

01:10:07.245 --> 01:10:10.845
and we are so happy that
you are home, I can't tell you.

01:10:12.375 --> 01:10:15.599
And because you and Mikey
work so well together...

01:10:15.878 --> 01:10:20.033
I was thinking me and my Banshee
could take some time off...

01:10:20.133 --> 01:10:23.437
and go on that honeymoon
we've been talking about.

01:10:23.928 --> 01:10:25.830
What are you saying?

01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:27.498
Follow me.

01:10:27.598 --> 01:10:30.993
- What are you doing?
- Aw.

01:10:31.644 --> 01:10:34.464
- Crazy man.
- Wait for it. Wait for it.

01:10:34.564 --> 01:10:35.923
Huh?

01:10:36.023 --> 01:10:37.759
- Huh?
- Oh!

01:10:37.859 --> 01:10:40.787
Whoa! Whoo!

01:10:40.903 --> 01:10:43.389
- Yeah.
- Daddy, you are so romantic.

01:10:43.489 --> 01:10:46.918
Oh, it's the best Christmas
present I ever got.

01:10:47.410 --> 01:10:51.314
Another ride with my guy.

01:10:51.414 --> 01:10:52.815
Ho-ho-ho.

01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:53.983
Whoo!

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:55.443
Fancy.

01:10:55.543 --> 01:10:58.988
Look at you two. You must be
working some kind of magic.

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:00.657
I know a trick or two.

01:11:00.757 --> 01:11:04.369
- I wanted to drop off my famous...
- Cookies? Liz's Christmas cookies?

01:11:04.469 --> 01:11:07.163
Hot, sweet and straight
from the oven.

01:11:07.263 --> 01:11:10.157
- Whoa. Save some.
- Yeah, right.

01:11:10.558 --> 01:11:14.783
So, what's this I hear about
you staying in Jersey?

01:11:14.937 --> 01:11:17.615
There's nowhere I'd rather be.

01:11:17.774 --> 01:11:20.998
Aw. Merry Christmas, you guys.

01:11:24.322 --> 01:11:28.672
- Oh, please.
- What did you do?

01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:32.634
Maybe we should finish up with that.

01:11:56.521 --> 01:11:58.423
<i>Ho-ho-ho.</i>

01:11:58.523 --> 01:12:01.292
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

01:12:54.412 --> 01:12:56.840
That's a wrap for <i>Christmas Bounty.</i>

01:12:57.305 --> 01:13:03.642
