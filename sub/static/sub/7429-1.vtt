Defy reason.
Defy everything you know.

01:31.567 --> 01:34.320
Welcome to Fright Night.

01:34.445 --> 01:38.282
Onstage at the Hard Rock Hotel
and Casino in Las Vegas.

01:38.407 --> 01:39.366
Welcome back.

01:39.492 --> 01:42.620
In the northern Las Vegas suburb
of Hillcrest Bluffs today,

01:42.745 --> 01:46.207
a woman leaving a grocery store says
a man came up to her

01:46.332 --> 01:47.875
and tried to bite her.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.211
He was scared off
by the security guard.

01:50.336 --> 01:52.505
If you've seen or witnessed anything
similar...

04:04.428 --> 04:07.598
Really? Really?
I'm going to take you apart.

04:07.723 --> 04:10.184
You watch me.
Watch me take you apart.

04:10.309 --> 04:12.520
You're done. You're done.

04:12.645 --> 04:13.771
Nothing doing?

04:13.896 --> 04:18.817
This thing has got no ambition.
It's got no huevos.

04:18.942 --> 04:21.695
Doris, do you want some help
with the trash?

04:21.821 --> 04:24.156
Oh, I got it. Thanks.

04:25.324 --> 04:29.662
All right. Good to see you, Char-Char.
You're getting big.

04:37.586 --> 04:41.257
Hey, kid. Don't leer at the neighbors.

04:41.841 --> 04:43.634
She's the one that
put the word on her butt.

04:43.759 --> 04:45.636
I'm just reading it.

04:48.347 --> 04:50.141
Is he ever going to
move that dumpster?

04:50.266 --> 04:52.768
Oh, Mom, come on.
You got to get over it.

04:53.185 --> 04:55.187
Attitude.

04:55.312 --> 04:57.690
You've been stressed or something.

04:59.817 --> 05:01.402
Amy?

05:01.527 --> 05:04.655
Amy is good.
Hasn't dumped me yet, so...

05:06.532 --> 05:09.160
Getting what you want can be stressful.

05:09.285 --> 05:12.371
Especially when you're not used
to getting it. More to lose.

05:12.496 --> 05:16.250
You reading those books again?
The Power of Whatever-the-Hell?

05:16.375 --> 05:20.421
Because they're definitely not working.

05:20.546 --> 05:22.631
And neither is this bike.

05:22.798 --> 05:24.425
Still tripping out over some guy's box.

05:24.550 --> 05:26.343
It's an eyesore.

05:26.469 --> 05:30.264
I'm trying to get people to move in,
not join the legions leaving town.

05:30.389 --> 05:32.349
- I like that word. "Legions."
- Hello.

05:32.475 --> 05:34.685
Can I get some help here?

05:34.810 --> 05:37.146
- When the Perrys lived there...
- When the Perrys lived there,

05:37.271 --> 05:40.816
they were the greatest neighbors ever,
but they moved.

05:40.941 --> 05:43.778
I thought you were happy
their house finally sold.

05:43.944 --> 05:47.239
He's not digging a pool, so where did
all this concrete come from?

05:47.364 --> 05:48.449
That's a very good question.

05:48.574 --> 05:51.535
Maybe you should spy on him
some more and find out.

05:52.495 --> 05:56.123
He's 13 feet from our house.
That's not spying.

05:56.499 --> 05:59.752
It's merely observing.

06:00.377 --> 06:04.048
- Hi, Mrs. Brewster.
- Hey, honey. Hi, girls.

06:04.173 --> 06:06.091
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:09.428 --> 06:12.723
- Oh, hey, Ed called again.
- Yeah?

06:12.848 --> 06:14.850
I'm tired of
making excuses for you, Charley.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.685
If you don't want to talk to him,
just tell him.

06:16.811 --> 06:19.814
Kind of defeats the purpose.

06:22.650 --> 06:25.945
- Still can't get the bike started?
- No faith.

06:26.070 --> 06:29.323
So you don't need a ride?

06:29.657 --> 06:31.617
Amy!

06:33.494 --> 06:36.831
Amy! Oh, my God.

06:39.083 --> 06:40.292
- Charley?
- Yeah.

06:40.417 --> 06:41.544
- Guess what?
- What?

06:41.669 --> 06:45.339
- Guess what? We are on time.
- Oh, good.

06:45.464 --> 06:47.383
- You stress too much.
- No, I don't.

06:47.508 --> 06:50.010
Yeah, you do.
You do your worried thing.

06:50.136 --> 06:52.513
- What's my "worried thing"?
- Your worried thing.

06:52.638 --> 06:55.808
I don't have a worried thing.
I never make that face.

06:55.933 --> 06:57.810
All the time.

06:57.977 --> 07:02.523
- Ladies.
- Dudes. Looking good.

07:04.108 --> 07:06.652
Seriously? A mochaccino?

07:06.777 --> 07:09.405
You can't ride with the girls any more.
I mean,

07:09.530 --> 07:12.241
you let them brush your hair,
My Pretty Pony?

07:12.366 --> 07:13.451
Chuck's secure.

07:13.576 --> 07:15.995
Nice, man. Nice kicks.

07:16.120 --> 07:19.039
- Puce.
- Fuck, yeah.

07:19.165 --> 07:21.208
I have track after school.
I'll see you later.

07:21.333 --> 07:23.294
Hey, Amy, Amy.

07:23.419 --> 07:28.591
About the prom. I was going to ask you.
I just kind of figured it was a go.

07:28.716 --> 07:33.304
You, me, ill-fitting tuxedo.
The whole thing, you know?

07:33.637 --> 07:37.641
No. Nobody goes to the dance
in senior year.

07:37.892 --> 07:38.976
Okay. Yeah, I knew that.

07:39.101 --> 07:40.936
- It's so not cool.
- I know.

07:41.061 --> 07:44.398
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

07:51.530 --> 07:54.200
Did you find
a freaking genie lamp, man?

07:54.325 --> 07:59.663
Make a sacrifice to the hot-ass gods?
How do you get that?

07:59.914 --> 08:01.916
Just game, man.

08:02.041 --> 08:04.335
Rock-solid game.

08:05.377 --> 08:08.506
- He doesn't even have a car.
- Seriously.

08:09.507 --> 08:10.841
- Ben Wegener?
- Here.

08:10.966 --> 08:12.927
Nick Straley?

08:13.969 --> 08:15.846
Nick?

08:16.597 --> 08:18.474
- Courtney Frank?
- Here.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.643
Adam Johnson?

08:20.893 --> 08:22.686
Adam?

08:22.812 --> 08:24.730
- Steve Danton?
- Here.

08:24.855 --> 08:27.483
- Matt Hofstetler?
- Yo.

08:27.608 --> 08:30.778
- Ellen Mclntosh?
- Here, Ms. Granada.

08:30.903 --> 08:32.571
Samuel Silverman?

08:32.696 --> 08:35.741
Holy crap, man. How did you get that?

08:35.866 --> 08:37.451
She's hard up, man.

08:37.576 --> 08:40.703
Dude, I think Ed's going to talk to us.

08:40.996 --> 08:42.164
Hey, can I get a minute?

08:42.289 --> 08:44.583
Just the two of you? That's sweet!

08:44.708 --> 08:47.586
Now he can school you
in the ways of geek-douchery.

08:47.711 --> 08:50.673
Nice. Don't you have
some sluts to go fuck?

08:50.798 --> 08:52.341
Actually, yeah, I do.

08:52.466 --> 08:54.718
It's important, Brewster.

09:00.057 --> 09:01.225
What's up, Ed?

09:01.350 --> 09:03.018
You know Adam's missing, right?

09:03.144 --> 09:04.812
What do you mean, Adam's missing?

09:04.937 --> 09:08.399
I keep trying him.
No texts, no phone calls, nothing.

09:08.524 --> 09:09.942
I don't know if you were
paying attention at roll call,

09:10.067 --> 09:12.361
but he's not the only one that's gone.

09:12.528 --> 09:14.738
Kids aren't coming to school.
That happens all the time.

09:14.864 --> 09:15.906
What do you want me to do about it?

09:16.031 --> 09:17.283
Just meet me at his house after school.

09:17.408 --> 09:18.951
We'll check around
and see if he's okay.

09:19.076 --> 09:21.704
I can't. I'm sorry. I'm busy.

09:21.829 --> 09:24.498
I don't think you understand
what I'm telling you. Adam's gone.

09:24.623 --> 09:26.667
Do we really have to do this here?

09:26.792 --> 09:28.502
Am I supposed to not even speak
to you any more?

09:28.627 --> 09:31.380
- Be quiet. Don't spaz out.
- "Don't spaz out."

09:31.505 --> 09:34.675
You don't want me to spaz out?
Oh, my God! It's so horrible!

09:34.800 --> 09:39.054
Crossing the streams! Will high school
as we know it cease to exist?

09:40.723 --> 09:45.227
Okay. You want me to go tell your pals
how well we really know each other?

09:45.352 --> 09:48.481
The LEGO contests,
the Farscape conventions,

09:48.606 --> 09:49.899
- the costumes?
- Please stop.

09:50.024 --> 09:51.942
Or how about that one time
you took my Stretch Armstrong,

09:52.067 --> 09:54.528
so you could tie it around your balls
and jerk off for an hour?

09:54.653 --> 09:57.615
- Stop.
- Then be my backup.

09:58.991 --> 10:02.536
Okay, fine. Adam's after school.

10:02.661 --> 10:04.622
Don't be late.

10:07.041 --> 10:09.794
I'd really like Stretch back, by the way.

10:15.925 --> 10:17.968
You know what I want for dinner?

10:18.093 --> 10:20.805
You realize you're eating
right now, right?

10:20.930 --> 10:23.474
You just forced me to get you
a smoothie so big

10:23.599 --> 10:26.018
that they named a planet after it.

10:26.811 --> 10:30.231
It's true. I'm insatiable.

10:30.356 --> 10:32.399
You are.

10:37.029 --> 10:39.573
What was that for?

10:39.865 --> 10:41.909
Nothing.

10:42.993 --> 10:47.456
I'm so sorry to take up your time.
I really appreciate your help.

10:47.748 --> 10:50.835
Is my mom flirting?

10:52.044 --> 10:54.839
Hey, Charley, I'm at Adam's house,

10:54.964 --> 10:57.758
and it's really weird,
because you're not here.

10:57.883 --> 11:00.094
Remember those videos of us
back in the day?

11:00.219 --> 11:03.013
Adam, you, and I dressed in tights?

11:03.264 --> 11:07.768
You don't want your new pals
seeing you in that, do you? All right.

11:10.062 --> 11:13.441
So, not a pool?
What's the work you're doing?

11:13.566 --> 11:16.735
Foundation problems.
I had to rip up half the basement.

11:16.861 --> 11:18.988
Oh, these houses were
practically built overnight.

11:19.113 --> 11:21.073
It never surprises me
when they come apart.

11:21.198 --> 11:23.492
This is the third time
this thing has broken.

11:23.617 --> 11:26.412
Done. Just needed a new stem.

11:26.662 --> 11:30.082
Jerry, this is my son, Charley, and his...

11:30.207 --> 11:32.543
I don't know. Do we say "girlfriend"?

11:32.668 --> 11:33.961
Hi, I'm Amy.

11:34.086 --> 11:35.713
Hey, Jerry.

11:35.838 --> 11:37.006
Nice to meet you.

11:37.131 --> 11:40.426
So, Jerry is our
new neighbor at the Perry place.

11:40.718 --> 11:43.220
- And he's handy.
- No kidding.

11:43.345 --> 11:45.639
I'm sorry about the mess, Charley.

11:45.765 --> 11:49.560
I was just saying to your mom
I'll have the dumpster gone tomorrow.

11:49.727 --> 11:51.020
It doesn't bother me. My mom was...

11:51.145 --> 11:54.064
Jerry does night construction
on the Strip.

11:55.065 --> 11:56.942
You play ball.

11:58.194 --> 12:00.112
I'm always looking for a pickup game.

12:00.237 --> 12:03.157
Yeah, no, I do. Definitely.

12:03.282 --> 12:04.867
- I do.
- It's more of a collector thing, the shoes.

12:04.992 --> 12:08.662
He's obsessed.
They sleep on sidewalks to get them.

12:08.788 --> 12:13.626
- I play, though.
- It takes a real man to wear

12:13.959 --> 12:15.878
puce.

12:16.086 --> 12:17.963
I like them.

12:18.881 --> 12:23.469
So, I'd invite you guys inside,
but it's a mess.

12:23.886 --> 12:26.555
- I've been meaning to.
- Be neighborly.

12:26.680 --> 12:30.351
A drink. Something.

12:40.111 --> 12:41.320
Soon, okay?

12:41.445 --> 12:43.906
Yeah, you bet.
And thank you so much for the help.

12:44.031 --> 12:46.867
It's the least I could do.

12:47.493 --> 12:49.703
My God. Why did you blow him off?

12:49.829 --> 12:53.290
A guy that good-looking still single?
Bad bet. He is a player.

12:53.415 --> 12:55.626
Nice, Mom, breaking it down.

12:55.751 --> 12:59.630
I've had enough man troubles.
I am not getting suckered again.

13:05.970 --> 13:07.471
I got to go.

13:07.596 --> 13:09.723
- What?
- I'll call you later. Okay?

13:09.849 --> 13:11.183
- Now?
- Dinner's on.

13:11.308 --> 13:13.102
- That's fine. I'll eat after.
- Charley!

13:13.227 --> 13:16.313
- Are you okay?
- Okay, see you, guys.

13:33.330 --> 13:35.040
Dude, where the hell have you been?

13:35.166 --> 13:38.127
- You said after school.
- I meant right after. This is dusk.

13:38.252 --> 13:40.129
- Do you know what that means?
- No, I have no idea.

13:40.254 --> 13:43.757
- Let me consult my pocket dictionary.
- Nice.

13:46.427 --> 13:49.972
Hello? Anybody home?

13:50.973 --> 13:52.850
Nope.

14:09.992 --> 14:11.744
This is nuts.

14:11.869 --> 14:14.330
I really hate to be the one
to tell you this, but

14:14.455 --> 14:16.749
that guy, your neighbor,

14:17.082 --> 14:19.001
he's a vampire, man.

14:19.126 --> 14:22.338
- My neighbor? Next door?
- Yeah.

14:22.463 --> 14:24.089
Jerry. I just met him.

14:24.215 --> 14:25.758
Okay. Jerry.

14:25.883 --> 14:28.344
That is a terrible vampire name. Jerry?

14:28.469 --> 14:32.848
I didn't name him, man.
I'm just reporting the facts.

14:36.477 --> 14:38.354
Dude.

14:48.322 --> 14:50.199
Hello?

14:51.784 --> 14:53.661
Adam?

14:58.499 --> 15:01.377
Yo. It's Ed.

15:06.382 --> 15:09.385
- Jesus.
- I feel stupid. It's a cardboard cut-out.

15:09.510 --> 15:11.137
Nice.

15:11.262 --> 15:15.141
- They're not here, dude.
- It's not just them, okay? Listen to me.

15:15.266 --> 15:17.935
I saw this thing on channel 13
where there was this lady

15:18.060 --> 15:20.729
who escaped an attacker
that tried to bite her.

15:20.855 --> 15:23.065
Why are you walking like that?

15:26.944 --> 15:29.321
All right. Listen.

15:30.364 --> 15:33.742
Adam and I graphed out all the attacks,
all the disappearances.

15:33.868 --> 15:35.828
- Whole families, gone.
- That happens all the time.

15:35.953 --> 15:37.788
Nobody lives in Vegas,
they just pass through.

15:37.913 --> 15:39.415
You live in Vegas.

15:39.540 --> 15:43.836
That's you right there in the center,
next to his house and Perry's old place.

15:43.961 --> 15:45.796
His windows
are completely blacked out.

15:45.921 --> 15:47.339
Lots of people
have blacked-out windows.

15:47.465 --> 15:49.383
They work on the Strip at night,
sleep during the day.

15:49.508 --> 15:51.802
Which is why it's the perfect plan. It fits!

15:51.927 --> 15:53.888
What? That Jerry's a Dracula?

15:54.013 --> 15:56.932
No. Dracula is one specific vampire.
I'm telling you...

15:57.057 --> 16:01.103
Dude, I know what you're telling me.
I'm making fun of you. I'm mocking you.

16:01.228 --> 16:03.814
- Awesome.
- You read way too much Twilight.

16:03.939 --> 16:06.108
That's fiction. This is real.

16:06.233 --> 16:07.276
He's a real monster,

16:07.401 --> 16:10.237
and he's not brooding,
or lovesick, or noble.

16:10.362 --> 16:12.823
He's the fucking shark from Jaws.

16:12.948 --> 16:16.410
He kills, he feeds, and he doesn't stop
until everybody around him is dead.

16:16.535 --> 16:20.289
And I seriously am so angry
you think I read Twilight.

16:26.003 --> 16:29.799
Ed? Ed?

16:30.049 --> 16:31.842
You haven't asked him in yet,
have you?

16:31.967 --> 16:33.260
Because obviously he can't get in

16:33.385 --> 16:34.929
without an invitation.
I know you know that.

16:35.054 --> 16:37.348
- You're on drugs, dude.
- No, well... Yeah.

16:37.473 --> 16:39.058
But I thought you'd take
my word on this, man.

16:39.183 --> 16:40.768
I have hard evidence at home.

16:40.893 --> 16:42.770
Okay.

16:44.230 --> 16:47.358
All right. Listen.
We have to stake him in his nest, okay?

16:47.483 --> 16:50.820
Me and you. But not now. It's too dark.

16:50.945 --> 16:51.946
We should go during the day.

16:52.071 --> 16:53.405
That's what I read
on Peter Vincent's website.

16:53.531 --> 16:56.075
- The magician?
- Yeah.

16:56.200 --> 16:58.369
The magician in the bandana
and the leather pants and...

16:58.494 --> 16:59.829
- Yes.
- ...tattoos and...

16:59.954 --> 17:01.914
Yes. He's the master of dark forces.

17:02.039 --> 17:06.210
He studies vampire methodology.
What else do you need?

17:09.421 --> 17:13.550
Can we just pretend for one minute
that you're not a complete douchebag?

17:13.675 --> 17:15.344
Evil, this was fun when we were eight.

17:15.469 --> 17:17.930
- Try 16.
- Whatever, man!

17:18.055 --> 17:20.348
Point is I grew up.
If you don't want to, that's fine,

17:20.473 --> 17:23.269
but don't get an attitude because
I'd rather have a life than make shit up.

17:23.394 --> 17:27.021
I get it. You're so cool, Brewster.

17:27.147 --> 17:29.233
Go ahead and join
your Clark High early peakers,

17:29.358 --> 17:31.402
- and that includes your girlfriend.
- Shut up.

17:31.527 --> 17:34.071
She's undeniably doable,
yes, I will give you that,

17:34.196 --> 17:36.073
but we used to make fun
of her and her friends.

17:36.198 --> 17:38.909
- She's a skank. We used to make fun...
- Shut up!

17:46.167 --> 17:49.420
Adam's gone and you act
like you don't give a shit!

17:50.963 --> 17:52.465
What the fuck happened to you?

17:52.590 --> 17:55.176
We were inseparable.

17:55.426 --> 17:58.137
You know when my life
started to get better?

17:58.262 --> 18:01.015
When I stopped being friends with you.

18:16.655 --> 18:19.074
What a fucking asshole.

18:25.122 --> 18:26.999
Goddamn.

18:28.793 --> 18:32.338
- Why are you on my street, bro?
- Sorry. I'm really sorry about that.

18:32.463 --> 18:34.673
You tracked your nerd juice
all the way down it.

18:34.799 --> 18:38.010
Really? Looks like I tracked
some nerd juice on your face there.

18:38.135 --> 18:41.305
Oh, yeah? Do I still got some?
Still there?

18:41.430 --> 18:42.973
Okay.

18:43.099 --> 18:45.935
Just hit me. Really,
I don't have time for this.

18:46.060 --> 18:47.186
Seriously?

18:47.311 --> 18:49.897
Jesus, I just gave you
a fucking invitation to hit me.

18:50.022 --> 18:52.191
You just gave me an invitation...

18:54.485 --> 18:58.823
You better run, boy!
I'm coming! You better run!

19:12.419 --> 19:15.089
Unbelievable.

19:30.896 --> 19:32.773
Shit!

19:32.898 --> 19:37.319
You back the fuck up! I'm armed!
I know how to use this thing!

19:37.862 --> 19:40.406
Hello! Please!
Please, somebody let me in!

19:40.531 --> 19:42.867
Someone's after me right now!
Please!

19:42.992 --> 19:46.287
Help me! God damn it!

19:55.921 --> 20:00.634
Forget it, Jerry. No invitation.
You can't get in.

20:03.429 --> 20:05.473
Oh, shit.

20:05.598 --> 20:10.561
Abandoned. I thought
you did your homework.

20:10.728 --> 20:13.314
You've been watching me.

20:14.940 --> 20:19.403
I've been watching you.
It seems fair.

21:01.320 --> 21:03.239
Shit, shit.

21:03.906 --> 21:06.200
That looked like it hurt.

21:16.919 --> 21:18.712
You bit off more than you can chew.

21:18.838 --> 21:22.716
It's too late. I told people what you are.
You've been made!

21:22.925 --> 21:25.636
And you think anyone's
actually going to believe you.

21:25.761 --> 21:28.180
Don't play that crap,
don't play that mind shit with me.

21:28.305 --> 21:30.433
I'm serious. Try me!

21:30.599 --> 21:32.476
Okay.

21:36.605 --> 21:40.067
You say you're glad you're different.

21:40.192 --> 21:44.071
- Get back!
- How can you be in a place like this?

21:44.196 --> 21:47.825
These people, even your best friend,

21:47.950 --> 21:50.995
- you're nothing to him now.
- No.

21:51.454 --> 21:54.081
You were born for this.

21:54.206 --> 21:56.333
And you know it.

21:58.377 --> 22:00.463
It's a gift.

22:24.820 --> 22:27.114
Good on his word.

22:29.825 --> 22:32.369
Kid Comeback!

22:32.828 --> 22:34.705
Gladiator Man!

22:34.830 --> 22:36.791
Squid Man!

22:36.916 --> 22:39.794
- Come at me if you dare!
- I dare!

22:43.214 --> 22:45.800
What can you do now, Squid Man?

22:49.929 --> 22:53.182
- Hey, you.
- Is Charley up yet?

22:53.307 --> 22:57.103
You try. My voice seems to be
on some frequency he can't hear.

22:57.228 --> 22:58.479
Charley!

22:58.604 --> 23:01.398
The world is Kid Comeback's!

23:04.527 --> 23:06.445
No, you're already dead.
No, you're already dead.

23:06.570 --> 23:08.447
Coming!

23:09.365 --> 23:11.826
- Eden Miller?
- Here.

23:11.992 --> 23:13.869
Ed Lee?

23:15.538 --> 23:17.456
Edward Lee?

23:18.666 --> 23:21.168
- Zach Taylor?
- Here.

23:21.335 --> 23:23.629
- Beth Tepper?
- Here.

23:33.097 --> 23:34.181
Charley!

23:34.306 --> 23:37.268
- Hey, Mrs. Lee.
- What a nice surprise. Come in.

23:37.393 --> 23:39.186
Rick, Charley's here.

23:39.311 --> 23:40.855
- This looks great.
- Thank you.

23:40.980 --> 23:45.359
- Look at you, so handsome!
- No. You look great.

23:45.484 --> 23:48.904
Ed said you really sprouted up.
Look at you. How's it going?

23:49.029 --> 23:50.739
Ed's going to be so sorry
he missed you.

23:50.865 --> 23:54.326
- Oh, he's not here?
- No, he leaves early.

23:54.785 --> 23:58.372
Do you mind if I run upstairs and...
There's just a book that we need.

23:58.497 --> 24:01.250
Of course. Make yourself at home.

24:01.584 --> 24:04.336
- Right up there.
- Nope, I remember.

24:30.529 --> 24:32.615
Oh, man.

24:41.165 --> 24:45.085
Peter Vincent.
Welcome to Fright...

24:52.510 --> 24:56.222
Oh, Adam. Here he comes.
You see? You see what I'm saying?

24:56.347 --> 24:59.475
He's a guy with a wheelbarrow.
The horror.

24:59.600 --> 25:03.229
Don't be a dick.
You know what I'm trying to prove.

25:05.689 --> 25:08.109
There. That's his truck.

25:08.526 --> 25:11.529
Fuck! Fuck me! Oh, he didn't look.

25:12.363 --> 25:15.825
That's him right there, Adam.
He does not show up on the video.

25:15.950 --> 25:19.870
He is so nailed. So nailed.

25:45.646 --> 25:48.315
- Hey, guy.
- Hey.

25:48.607 --> 25:50.234
Guy.

25:50.359 --> 25:53.779
- You could really do me a solid.
- What's that?

25:54.196 --> 25:58.909
I got a girl on her way over for a beer,
and I'm all out of beer.

25:59.034 --> 26:01.871
It's... Sucks.

26:01.996 --> 26:05.708
Set me up. I'll pay you back two times.
A sixer for your mom and one for you.

26:05.833 --> 26:08.669
- What do you say?
- Yeah.

26:08.794 --> 26:10.921
Yeah, let me do that.

26:11.964 --> 26:15.134
Right now. I'll go right now
and check what we got in the fridge.

26:15.259 --> 26:17.219
Okay.

26:17.678 --> 26:20.639
- Cool. Just give me a second.
- Cool.

26:23.851 --> 26:26.520
Let me just see what she's got.

26:27.062 --> 26:29.106
Mom's kind of a...

26:30.024 --> 26:31.901
Kind of a

26:32.234 --> 26:34.528
light domestic

26:35.529 --> 26:37.448
kind of a mother.

26:43.162 --> 26:45.122
Nice kitchen.

26:46.290 --> 26:48.751
Good cabinet work.

26:49.126 --> 26:51.003
Thanks.

26:53.798 --> 26:55.800
You cool with Budweiser?

26:56.592 --> 26:58.886
Yeah, that works. Yeah.

27:03.057 --> 27:04.350
- Oh, shit.
- Can I help you with that?

27:04.475 --> 27:07.019
No! No, no.

27:09.980 --> 27:12.149
I got it.

27:15.152 --> 27:17.655
I just... Yeah, I got it.

27:34.964 --> 27:37.591
Sorry it's not a sixer.

27:54.859 --> 27:57.653
This girl tonight, she's a handful.

27:58.737 --> 28:00.614
You know?

28:00.906 --> 28:03.826
Women who look a certain way, they...

28:06.162 --> 28:08.456
They need to be managed.

28:08.831 --> 28:10.749
It's true.

28:17.631 --> 28:20.009
Your dad ducked out on you?

28:20.551 --> 28:25.347
Your mom, she didn't exactly say, but...

28:28.100 --> 28:32.313
there's a kind of neglect.

28:34.899 --> 28:37.318
Gives off a scent.

28:40.112 --> 28:43.991
You don't mind my saying,
you got a lot on your shoulders for a kid.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.410
The two of you,

28:46.535 --> 28:48.412
alone.

28:49.663 --> 28:53.667
And your girl, Amy, she's ripe.

28:53.793 --> 28:59.006
I bet there's a line of guys
dying to pluck that. Your mom, too.

28:59.590 --> 29:05.054
You don't see it. Maybe you do,
but she's putting it out.

29:07.264 --> 29:09.892
It's on you to look out for them.

29:10.893 --> 29:13.979
You up for that, guy?

29:15.314 --> 29:18.484
- I think I can manage.
- Good.

29:18.609 --> 29:23.322
Because there are a lot of
bad people out there, Charley.

29:30.162 --> 29:33.332
Everyone's got to look
after his own business.

29:40.464 --> 29:42.925
Thanks for the beers.

29:54.895 --> 29:56.647
Hey.

29:56.772 --> 29:58.566
Where have you been?

29:58.691 --> 30:01.485
You told me to meet you here
an hour ago.

30:03.362 --> 30:05.239
Hello?

30:05.865 --> 30:06.949
Hey, are you all right?

30:07.074 --> 30:10.035
Are you all right? Everything good?

30:10.161 --> 30:11.871
Yep.

30:11.996 --> 30:15.374
- Why shouldn't it be?
- No, it should.

30:15.499 --> 30:17.751
Did you ever read this?

30:18.294 --> 30:20.004
- No.
- It's really good.

30:20.129 --> 30:22.465
It's kind of sexy, actually, in like,

30:22.590 --> 30:27.052
frustrated, unconsummated sort of way.

30:27.261 --> 30:29.096
Like us, you mean.

30:29.221 --> 30:31.307
Kind of makes it hotter.

30:39.190 --> 30:43.694
- Am I boring you?
- No, I'm just tired. Sorry.

30:43.819 --> 30:46.822
Okay. That's all right.
We can fix that.

30:48.491 --> 30:52.703
Do you want to
get under the covers?

30:55.164 --> 30:58.709
Right now? Really?

30:59.251 --> 31:03.172
Yeah, why not?
We could just give it a go, and...

31:03.547 --> 31:06.383
Please believe me, there is nothing
I would rather be doing right now

31:06.509 --> 31:09.220
than getting under the covers with you.

31:09.345 --> 31:11.222
Okay.

31:12.598 --> 31:17.436
Charley, don't be nervous.

31:17.561 --> 31:19.438
It's okay.

31:20.940 --> 31:23.818
I'm not nervous, I'm cool.
I'm good.

31:33.953 --> 31:35.871
Did you hear that?

31:35.996 --> 31:38.124
Sorry I'm late.

31:38.415 --> 31:42.128
Doris. Oh, shit.

31:43.045 --> 31:44.255
Shit.

31:44.380 --> 31:46.298
What? He's hot,
your neighbor's a stripper.

31:46.424 --> 31:47.675
They were bound to find each other.

31:47.800 --> 31:49.218
Go-go dancer.

31:49.343 --> 31:53.806
No. You take away two tiny pieces
of cloth, she is a stripper.

31:53.931 --> 31:55.808
Rude.

31:56.851 --> 31:59.228
Oh, shit! Oh, shit, he saw us!

31:59.353 --> 32:01.856
Maybe.
It's not a big deal.

32:01.981 --> 32:07.403
It's a huge deal, okay? Very big deal.
He looked at us and he was pissed!

32:08.112 --> 32:11.031
Okay, Charley, if you're not into this,
can you just tell me?

32:11.157 --> 32:12.700
Because you don't have to
do me any favors.

32:12.825 --> 32:16.787
Amy, I'm not doing you any favors.
Of course I'm into this. Of course.

32:16.912 --> 32:18.831
I don't trust that guy.

32:18.956 --> 32:21.709
You're so stupid, Charley.

32:21.834 --> 32:24.003
- I'm going.
- Oh, come on. I'm sorry.

32:24.128 --> 32:28.215
No, I'm going. I'm going to leave you to
look out the window at the neighbors

32:28.340 --> 32:31.761
and have fun
with your neighborhood watch thing!

32:51.989 --> 32:54.033
Oh, shit.

32:59.830 --> 33:01.707
911...

33:03.542 --> 33:06.629
A woman screaming?

33:07.463 --> 33:09.548
You bet she screamed.

33:10.216 --> 33:13.552
"You bet I made her scream." Jeez.

33:15.054 --> 33:17.223
- Keep it down a bit.
- Sure, absolutely.

33:17.348 --> 33:19.558
Unbelievable.

34:10.234 --> 34:13.946
Come on. Come on.

34:17.574 --> 34:19.452
There it is.

35:02.995 --> 35:04.872
Doris?

35:27.269 --> 35:29.230
Doris?

35:33.400 --> 35:35.486
Doris?

36:08.519 --> 36:10.521
Doris?

36:49.560 --> 36:51.437
Shit.

37:56.752 --> 37:58.754
Fuck!

38:01.507 --> 38:03.467
Doris?

38:03.592 --> 38:05.469
Doris.

38:05.803 --> 38:07.054
It's Charley.

38:07.179 --> 38:10.182
Charley? Charley!

38:10.307 --> 38:12.518
Oh, God! Get me out of here!

38:12.643 --> 38:15.020
I am. I am.

38:20.317 --> 38:22.194
Hurry!

38:30.494 --> 38:31.620
Shit! Shit!

38:31.745 --> 38:35.249
Oh, no, he's coming back!
He's coming back! No!

38:53.517 --> 38:55.936
No, please.

39:01.692 --> 39:04.445
Please don't. Please.

39:09.784 --> 39:13.287
No, please don't. Please don't.

40:39.206 --> 40:41.500
Fuck!

40:51.886 --> 40:53.888
Oh, God!

40:55.806 --> 40:59.185
Good. I got you. I got you.

40:59.310 --> 41:02.897
That's the first thing you wear for Joe
when you get your new boobies.

41:03.022 --> 41:06.108
I want to get breast implants, but
my husband, he's more of an ass guy,

41:06.233 --> 41:10.070
and he's very happy with my boobies,
with my minus-As.

43:09.607 --> 43:11.484
Thank you.

43:11.650 --> 43:15.529
You'll be all right.
You'll be all right.

43:33.964 --> 43:36.425
Hey, you're going to be late.

43:39.095 --> 43:43.432
The hours you keep.
It's like living with a vampire.

43:43.557 --> 43:45.059
Mom...

43:45.184 --> 43:48.062
That guy Jerry, next door.

43:48.187 --> 43:51.148
Under no circumstances
is he invited into our house,

43:51.273 --> 43:52.733
all right? He's dangerous.

43:52.858 --> 43:54.902
- I think I can handle myself.
- Mom, please, I'm serious.

43:55.027 --> 43:57.738
Don't acknowledge him.
Don't talk to him,

43:57.863 --> 44:00.074
and at night, please stay inside.

44:00.199 --> 44:01.659
Why? Because he's dangerous?

44:01.784 --> 44:04.662
I can't answer a million questions
right now. Will you just trust me?

44:04.787 --> 44:08.916
Charley, stop! I'm your mom,
not some ridiculous woman.

44:09.041 --> 44:13.504
I'm sorry, I can't do this right now.
I can't answer a million things right now.

44:13.629 --> 44:16.465
I don't understand. Charley!

44:29.895 --> 44:33.399
- Hey.
- Hey.

44:34.316 --> 44:37.987
You weren't in class.
What are you working on?

44:38.612 --> 44:40.489
Porn.

44:40.948 --> 44:44.952
Good. I thought
it was something creepy.

44:49.623 --> 44:51.792
You okay?

44:52.626 --> 44:56.088
- I should probably...
- Get back to your porn?

44:56.922 --> 45:00.009
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

45:53.854 --> 45:57.149
Get back, demons!

46:09.870 --> 46:11.872
No!

46:12.998 --> 46:18.546
Stop, stop, stop.
Stop! Cut it!

46:19.004 --> 46:21.924
Come on! What the fuck, people?

46:22.508 --> 46:25.386
Fire. She's supposed to be on fire,
not dribbling fucking smoke.

46:25.511 --> 46:27.430
She keeps moving the squib.

46:27.555 --> 46:29.223
Hey, I do not.

46:29.348 --> 46:34.061
But Mr. Fireman here almost nearly
burned off my extensions last time.

46:34.186 --> 46:39.024
Bugger this. Look!
Get me some professionals, all right?

46:40.693 --> 46:41.652
Mr. Vincent?

46:41.777 --> 46:43.904
Mr. Vincent?
Hi, I'm from the Vegas Sun.

46:44.029 --> 46:45.406
We had an appointment today.

46:45.531 --> 46:47.616
I don't think so.
Speak to my guy.

46:47.741 --> 46:50.161
No, we did. I'm doing that article,

46:50.286 --> 46:51.996
"Vampires: Separating Myth
From Fact."

46:52.121 --> 46:53.956
Do you want a quote?

46:54.081 --> 46:57.084
That's a shit idea for an article.

46:57.209 --> 46:59.211
Look, please...

47:00.421 --> 47:03.591
Please, I need your expertise
and you're the man on this stuff, so...

47:03.716 --> 47:06.051
I fucked her.

47:06.552 --> 47:08.387
Filthy!

47:10.097 --> 47:11.098
So, is this, what,

47:11.223 --> 47:13.517
your first assignment or something?

47:13.642 --> 47:15.561
Yeah.

47:18.314 --> 47:20.858
I'm going to pop your cherry.

47:20.983 --> 47:24.945
Ginger! Bring him upstairs.
You got 10 minutes.

47:32.077 --> 47:34.163
This is all his stuff?

47:34.288 --> 47:37.833
He started collecting tarots and Ouijas.
Gateway stuff.

47:37.958 --> 47:41.212
Now scholars,
they call him for answers.

47:41.337 --> 47:43.547
Those books, the forgotten texts,

47:43.672 --> 47:45.966
the Agrippa. He's read them all.

47:46.092 --> 47:49.220
No, don't touch anything.
He's PMS-y today.

47:49.345 --> 47:51.388
Sensitive little girl.

47:51.514 --> 47:56.102
Over there, that's haunted antiques.
Cursed stuff!

47:56.435 --> 48:01.982
And that's Pete's honorary degree
from LVSU.

48:02.108 --> 48:04.860
But he got it off the Internet.

48:08.614 --> 48:10.491
Fuck!

48:11.617 --> 48:14.203
The one and only.

48:15.371 --> 48:19.166
- Midori me.
- Midori yourself, douchebag.

48:19.291 --> 48:22.211
- Fuck you!
- Asswipe.

48:23.629 --> 48:25.881
Come on in. Come on.

48:40.020 --> 48:42.481
It looks like pee, but I'm hooked.

48:43.357 --> 48:45.526
- Do you want some?
- I'm good, thank you.

48:45.651 --> 48:49.864
No? Too much for you?
Do you want a Shirley Temple?

48:50.739 --> 48:52.825
Sit down.

48:55.995 --> 48:57.830
So,

48:58.748 --> 49:03.085
I'm the expert for your vampire thing?

49:04.086 --> 49:06.338
They're all the rage.

49:08.007 --> 49:10.259
Leather, it doesn't breathe.

49:10.384 --> 49:14.430
Fucking rashes are fucking killing me.

49:19.769 --> 49:21.645
Shoot.

49:22.021 --> 49:24.231
Right. Well...

49:24.356 --> 49:27.485
Look, I know your show...

49:29.320 --> 49:31.197
I know your show is an illusion.

49:31.322 --> 49:33.449
Meaning bullshit?

49:35.326 --> 49:40.998
- Yeah, fair enough.
- But say I wanted to kill a vampire.

49:42.083 --> 49:45.878
- Yeah, sorry. Go on.
- How would I go about doing that?

49:46.003 --> 49:48.547
You want to know how to kill a vampire?
Seriously?

49:48.672 --> 49:50.633
Yeah, kill a vampire.

49:50.758 --> 49:53.969
Well, let's think.

49:54.303 --> 49:58.015
You got fire, beheading.

49:59.350 --> 50:03.270
You can make him
a big garlicky omelet.

50:03.395 --> 50:06.565
Or go traditional.
Stake through the heart.

50:09.068 --> 50:12.196
Cool. So that stuff really works?

50:12.321 --> 50:15.491
Well, maybe not the omelet.

50:16.617 --> 50:18.911
How the fuck should I know?

50:22.581 --> 50:25.418
I don't know. You have all this stuff,

50:25.543 --> 50:27.420
and you...

50:28.337 --> 50:31.340
are "Peter Vincent: Vampire..."

50:32.049 --> 50:34.009
- I don't know. I'm not sure.
- I read books.

50:34.135 --> 50:39.932
You think I'm hanging out with Dracula?
And the Easter bunny? Fuck off.

50:42.143 --> 50:44.895
I'm sorry, but I have
a personal interest in this.

50:45.020 --> 50:48.107
I think one of them got my friend.

50:48.232 --> 50:50.359
What? "One of them,"
meaning a vampire?

50:50.484 --> 50:53.279
Yeah. Jerry.
He lives next door to me.

50:53.404 --> 50:56.866
Jerry? Jerry the vampire?

50:56.991 --> 51:00.327
Do you think I don't know
how this sounds?

51:00.453 --> 51:05.124
Two days ago I would have laughed
in my face, but it's really happening.

51:05.249 --> 51:07.626
I am so far down the rabbit hole.

51:07.752 --> 51:12.923
I was in his house, or his lair,
or whatever, and I got these pictures.

51:13.048 --> 51:15.092
- If you just look at them.
- Okay. Get out.

51:15.217 --> 51:17.595
- No, please.
- You're a nut job. Ginger!

51:17.720 --> 51:20.055
I'm not! I know what I saw.

51:20.181 --> 51:22.057
No, you don't. Illusion, remember?

51:22.183 --> 51:24.185
People see
what they want to see. This is...

51:24.310 --> 51:26.061
You don't collect this stuff.
You don't have all this stuff

51:26.187 --> 51:28.856
if you don't believe, and I promise you,
I can take you to him.

51:28.981 --> 51:30.524
I can show you
what you've been waiting for...

51:30.649 --> 51:33.277
What, in Clark County,
Nevada? Ginger!

51:33.402 --> 51:35.029
That's a hotbed of supernatural activity.

51:35.154 --> 51:37.531
It is, though. It's genius.

51:37.656 --> 51:41.076
It's a transient population. People
work all night, they sleep all day!

51:41.202 --> 51:42.536
Get this loser out of my sight, please.

51:42.661 --> 51:44.330
Stop!

51:44.455 --> 51:48.417
He got my friend already!
I am not crazy.

51:48.542 --> 51:51.962
I'm not. I don't want to know this shit.

51:52.088 --> 51:54.256
Please, just look at these pictures.

51:54.381 --> 51:58.010
Get the fuck out of my house!

51:58.385 --> 52:01.472
Time to go, doll. Come on.

52:20.616 --> 52:25.454
Dude, is that Charley?
What the fuck is he doing?

52:26.705 --> 52:27.957
It's paranoia.

52:28.082 --> 52:32.711
Once I thought I was being chased
by carrots with machetes.

52:32.962 --> 52:35.631
- I know!
- Whatever, man.

52:35.756 --> 52:38.551
You guys are both ruining my high.

52:39.760 --> 52:43.472
Oh, shit! All right,
ditch the weed. I'm cool.

52:49.520 --> 52:52.606
- Hey, guy.
- Yeah?

52:54.525 --> 52:57.611
- Fuck...
- Oh, fuck.

53:21.302 --> 53:22.303
Hey.

53:22.428 --> 53:24.805
- Hey.
- Hey.

53:26.682 --> 53:30.060
The whole house looks like that show.
Dark Shadows.

53:30.186 --> 53:35.107
Yeah. It's a gag for Amy.

53:35.232 --> 53:37.151
Long story.

53:38.110 --> 53:41.155
Don't, Mom, don't!
Don't open it!

53:45.117 --> 53:46.952
How did you get in here?

53:47.078 --> 53:48.662
- It was unlocked.
- Oh, my God.

53:48.788 --> 53:51.082
Mom, please, I told you to lock the door!

53:51.207 --> 53:52.875
Okay!

53:53.000 --> 53:56.128
You are flipping out.
You're acting all weird.

53:56.253 --> 53:58.798
You're blowing everything off.

53:59.673 --> 54:01.592
Is that a stake?

54:02.676 --> 54:06.222
No. Maybe.

54:07.098 --> 54:08.224
Look.

54:08.349 --> 54:13.562
Even if you are losing it,
you do not get to blow me off.

54:13.687 --> 54:16.982
You don't go from something
to nothing overnight.

54:17.316 --> 54:21.153
You're not nothing to me, Charley,
so whatever is happening,

54:21.278 --> 54:26.700
I would like you to talk to me,
to tell me what is going on.

54:27.868 --> 54:30.538
Oh, man. Amy, look...

54:31.789 --> 54:34.875
I need you to just
forget about me, okay?

54:35.000 --> 54:37.086
I'm not going to let you get hurt.
I'm sorry.

54:37.211 --> 54:40.047
What? How?
How am I going to get hurt?

54:46.220 --> 54:47.263
- Stay there.
- I got it.

54:47.388 --> 54:49.932
No! Don't answer it.
Please don't answer it.

54:50.057 --> 54:51.892
This is ridiculous, Charley.

54:52.017 --> 54:53.644
Jane, it's Jerry from next door.

54:53.769 --> 54:56.230
Don't answer the door.

54:56.355 --> 54:58.315
This is my house.
I will answer the door if I want to.

54:58.441 --> 54:59.567
But, Mom!

54:59.692 --> 55:02.111
Jane, I need to talk to you.

55:04.238 --> 55:05.531
Just hold on!

55:05.656 --> 55:08.659
Now. Your son is harassing me.

55:08.784 --> 55:10.077
- Charley, what is going on?
- Listen to me.

55:10.202 --> 55:11.829
Whatever he says,
he's going to try to slip...

55:11.954 --> 55:13.622
Jane, he broke into my house.

55:13.748 --> 55:14.915
Is that true?

55:15.040 --> 55:18.836
I'd rather not take this to the
authorities, but I will. I have no choice.

55:18.961 --> 55:21.881
He's sick! He's deluded.

55:23.674 --> 55:25.801
Please.

55:28.220 --> 55:30.848
Go get the authorities!

55:57.875 --> 56:00.711
- Shit!
- What?

56:04.090 --> 56:05.299
What is he doing?

56:05.424 --> 56:07.718
I don't know, but whatever it is,
it's not good.

56:12.598 --> 56:15.559
We're all right
as long as we stay inside

56:15.684 --> 56:18.687
because obviously
he can't get in without an invitation.

56:19.688 --> 56:23.526
- Like a vampire.
- Yeah, really, like a vampire.

56:24.276 --> 56:26.028
This is the joke for Amy, right?

56:26.153 --> 56:28.030
I can't believe
you got Jerry to go along with it.

56:28.155 --> 56:30.032
Take this.

56:30.616 --> 56:32.076
Okay.

56:32.201 --> 56:34.078
Vampire protection.

56:34.203 --> 56:36.580
I don't think this is funny.

56:39.333 --> 56:41.210
Shit.

56:44.130 --> 56:47.049
What the fuck
is he doing to my yard?

57:09.280 --> 57:11.157
What's that?

57:32.303 --> 57:34.930
I don't need an invitation
if there's no house.

57:35.055 --> 57:37.224
Come on. Come on!

57:38.517 --> 57:41.771
Get in! I'll drive.

57:45.316 --> 57:48.778
Jesus Christ, Charley,
what the hell is going on?

57:48.903 --> 57:52.698
Mom, just go!
Just gun it! Just go!

58:06.587 --> 58:08.380
- Is everybody okay?
- Are you all right?

58:08.506 --> 58:10.382
Nobody's hurt?

58:13.385 --> 58:15.262
Look out!

58:16.138 --> 58:20.184
Are you all right?
Amy, are you okay? You okay?

58:20.351 --> 58:21.811
- Jesus!
- Mom, keep driving!

58:21.936 --> 58:23.062
What the hell is going on?

58:23.187 --> 58:26.816
This is seriously not okay, Charley!
Who the fuck is this guy?

58:26.941 --> 58:28.859
Mom, I told you,
he's a fucking vampire!

58:28.984 --> 58:32.363
- Enough with the vampires!
- Really!

58:32.488 --> 58:36.117
Let's just calm down.
I'm going to call the police.

58:37.243 --> 58:39.078
- I don't have any service.
- I do. No.

58:39.203 --> 58:43.165
I hate the fucking desert!
Now I have a psycho next door.

58:45.418 --> 58:49.255
Oh, shit. Charley, is this him?
Who is this?

58:50.464 --> 58:53.467
Oh, man. Damn it.

58:53.592 --> 58:54.844
- Oh, my God.
- No.

58:54.969 --> 58:57.596
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no.

58:58.889 --> 59:01.225
God! What the fuck!

59:01.350 --> 59:02.351
What is he doing?

59:02.476 --> 59:03.686
Charley,
he's coming around the side.

59:03.811 --> 59:05.771
Keep going. Keep going.

59:05.896 --> 59:07.773
Jesus Christ.

59:07.898 --> 59:10.192
Shit. Look out!

59:12.194 --> 59:14.405
What does he want?

59:24.457 --> 59:26.709
- Oh, no. What do I do?
- Hit him.

59:26.834 --> 59:28.127
- What?
- Hit him.

59:28.252 --> 59:31.464
- Mom, just hit him!
- Charley, no!

59:31.589 --> 59:33.924
Just fucking hit him!

59:36.385 --> 59:38.012
- Don't stop.
- Holy shit!

59:38.137 --> 59:41.056
- Just drive. Don't stop!
- Oh, my God.

59:50.566 --> 59:53.402
- Do you see him?
- No.

59:56.989 --> 59:59.408
- Did I kill him?
- Hopefully.

01:00:12.004 --> 01:00:13.923
Mom.

01:00:15.549 --> 01:00:17.426
Oh, God.

01:00:20.262 --> 01:00:24.767
No! That's his fucked-up vampire hand.
Now do you believe me?

01:00:25.184 --> 01:00:26.227
Shit!

01:00:26.352 --> 01:00:28.854
Keep driving, Mom!

01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:35.319
Oh, my God!

01:00:36.028 --> 01:00:37.863
Charley, fucking kick him!

01:00:37.988 --> 01:00:39.949
Shit!

01:00:41.117 --> 01:00:43.702
Get away from me!

01:00:48.499 --> 01:00:50.793
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

01:01:00.928 --> 01:01:03.764
- Where is he? Where did he go?
- Stay in the car.

01:01:07.935 --> 01:01:09.478
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

01:01:09.603 --> 01:01:11.522
No! Stay in the car!

01:01:11.647 --> 01:01:14.608
You stop in the middle of the road,
you got a taillight out.

01:01:46.223 --> 01:01:48.100
No, Charley!

01:01:52.104 --> 01:01:53.731
Hey!

01:01:53.856 --> 01:01:55.733
Charley!

01:02:14.335 --> 01:02:16.212
Hey.

01:02:17.296 --> 01:02:19.298
Please go. It'll be all right.
Go. Take her and go!

01:02:19.423 --> 01:02:22.093
Amy, take her and go!

01:02:22.218 --> 01:02:24.470
Catch you later.

01:02:25.721 --> 01:02:28.974
I repel you with the power
of Christ the Lord.

01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:32.103
Do you? Really?

01:02:34.605 --> 01:02:37.983
That's a mighty big cross
you got there, Charley.

01:02:38.109 --> 01:02:41.403
The question is,
do you have faith?

01:02:41.529 --> 01:02:43.405
Get back!

01:02:44.490 --> 01:02:48.077
Not the cross.
Not the cross, Charley.

01:02:50.913 --> 01:02:53.290
Come here.

01:02:59.505 --> 01:03:02.675
You ever get a stake
in the chest, Charley?

01:03:03.592 --> 01:03:06.429
I have. It hurts.

01:03:06.554 --> 01:03:08.013
But they missed the heart.

01:03:08.139 --> 01:03:11.183
It's right here, Charley.

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:13.686
Easy measurement.

01:03:13.811 --> 01:03:16.522
You shouldn't have been so nosy.

01:03:28.492 --> 01:03:30.119
- Mom!
- Mrs. Brewster!

01:03:30.244 --> 01:03:32.288
Her head.

01:03:35.541 --> 01:03:37.418
- You got her?
- Yeah.

01:03:52.767 --> 01:03:55.269
- Charley...
- Hang on!

01:04:31.931 --> 01:04:34.725
Good show tonight,
right, babycakes?

01:04:34.850 --> 01:04:37.645
You were late again on
"The Devil's Torture Chamber."

01:04:37.770 --> 01:04:40.106
I have something for you. Look.

01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:44.485
You were early again
in the bedroom.

01:04:44.610 --> 01:04:45.778
Fuck you!

01:04:45.903 --> 01:04:49.573
I will fuck myself.
Someone's got to do it.

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:30.489
We won't be up all night.

01:05:30.656 --> 01:05:33.492
Honestly, it's really not a party.

01:05:34.243 --> 01:05:36.537
Sit tight. We might have
a few more questions for you.

01:05:36.662 --> 01:05:38.956
- Okay.
- Mom?

01:05:39.582 --> 01:05:42.168
I love you. Bye.

01:05:45.254 --> 01:05:49.216
They only asked a couple of questions.
We should be okay.

01:05:49.341 --> 01:05:52.678
I don't know. I think maybe you
should've said something to the police.

01:05:52.803 --> 01:05:57.057
Like what? "This vampire moved in,
borrowed a six-pack of Bud,

01:05:57.183 --> 01:06:01.187
ate a stripper and blew up our house
because we wouldn't invite him inside."

01:06:01.479 --> 01:06:05.691
Last time I called the cops,
they nearly all went to Chili's together.

01:06:07.693 --> 01:06:09.528
Okay.

01:06:13.324 --> 01:06:15.493
This is my fault.

01:06:16.535 --> 01:06:19.205
You didn't make any of it happen.

01:06:19.622 --> 01:06:23.000
Ed came to me,
and I turned my back on him.

01:06:23.125 --> 01:06:25.252
How were you supposed
to believe him?

01:06:25.377 --> 01:06:28.214
I mean, he begged me.

01:06:28.506 --> 01:06:30.633
I mean, he really...

01:06:31.509 --> 01:06:33.636
And he was my best friend.

01:06:34.136 --> 01:06:38.099
I know, but, Charley,
people, they change.

01:06:38.224 --> 01:06:41.227
Yeah, and I just changed into a dick.

01:06:41.352 --> 01:06:43.020
I figured my dweeb past

01:06:43.145 --> 01:06:46.690
wasn't really going to be
very popular with the ladies, so I...

01:06:47.525 --> 01:06:50.361
Are you trying to say
this is my fault?

01:06:55.199 --> 01:06:57.743
I just really wanted you to like me,
that's all.

01:06:58.202 --> 01:07:00.246
Charley,

01:07:01.330 --> 01:07:03.582
I knew you were a dweeb.

01:07:03.749 --> 01:07:08.129
Do you think I wanted
some dude like Mark? Or Ben?

01:07:08.254 --> 01:07:10.172
No.

01:07:10.589 --> 01:07:14.260
I like you. Because you're different.

01:07:17.179 --> 01:07:20.182
It didn't hurt
that your skin cleared up.

01:07:20.766 --> 01:07:22.726
Thanks.

01:07:27.857 --> 01:07:30.151
- Hello?
- I can help you.

01:07:30.276 --> 01:07:32.445
My place in one hour.

01:07:33.571 --> 01:07:35.072
We're going to see the Peter Vincent?

01:07:35.197 --> 01:07:39.910
It's underwhelming, believe me,
but he's what we've got.

01:07:40.119 --> 01:07:42.788
Mom's very religious.

01:07:49.128 --> 01:07:51.839
I'll tell you what I know,
but that's it.

01:07:51.964 --> 01:07:53.758
Right?

01:07:53.883 --> 01:07:59.388
Don't expect me to join
your little Scooby gang. Sit down.

01:08:00.264 --> 01:08:02.641
Whatever you got, I'll take it.

01:08:04.810 --> 01:08:07.271
That insignia you showed me.

01:08:08.647 --> 01:08:11.817
It's a species that originated
in the Mediterranean.

01:08:11.984 --> 01:08:15.654
They nest in the earth.
And they kill slowly.

01:08:16.113 --> 01:08:18.991
They keep their victims alive for days.

01:08:19.992 --> 01:08:21.702
Snackers.

01:08:21.827 --> 01:08:24.788
And they turn everyone?
They change them into...

01:08:24.913 --> 01:08:26.040
Yeah, I got it.

01:08:26.165 --> 01:08:29.794
They're tribal by nature.
He could be trying to turn them all.

01:08:29.919 --> 01:08:31.462
Replenish his ranks.

01:08:31.587 --> 01:08:33.714
How do we kill these guys?
This tribe.

01:08:33.839 --> 01:08:36.926
You two? You don't.

01:08:38.176 --> 01:08:42.598
It's a strong breed.
You're going to need an army.

01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:47.520
Hang on. Sorry. Sorry.

01:08:49.939 --> 01:08:51.398
- Hello!
- Mr. Vincent?

01:08:51.524 --> 01:08:53.567
- Yes!
- You have a delivery.

01:08:53.692 --> 01:08:55.736
All right. Send him up.

01:08:55.861 --> 01:08:58.113
Ginger, we've got a delivery!

01:08:59.156 --> 01:09:01.408
I'm watching my programme!
You get it!

01:09:01.533 --> 01:09:05.328
You're TiVo-ing it, you lazy cow!
Come on!

01:09:09.457 --> 01:09:11.877
Shit. Douchebag.

01:09:12.169 --> 01:09:14.462
Hi, doll.

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:18.926
eBay. I order things late at night
when I've had a few cocktails...

01:09:19.051 --> 01:09:21.011
So, yeah, some nice stuff.

01:09:21.136 --> 01:09:23.013
Wait a minute.
You get deliveries this late?

01:09:23.139 --> 01:09:25.057
Yeah.

01:09:27.893 --> 01:09:29.562
No. I don't know.

01:09:29.687 --> 01:09:32.689
Oh, shit. No. You said
that guy could come in. That's a...

01:09:32.814 --> 01:09:35.317
An invitation, airhead.

01:09:36.026 --> 01:09:38.696
Hey, Mr. Vincent, package for you.

01:09:38.821 --> 01:09:39.947
Fuck!

01:09:40.072 --> 01:09:42.533
One second, guys. Business call.

01:09:42.658 --> 01:09:45.077
Hello. Oh, yeah.

01:09:45.202 --> 01:09:49.915
No, I'm looking at them right now.
Yeah, come on up.

01:09:50.249 --> 01:09:52.251
He's actually quite modern.

01:09:52.376 --> 01:09:55.379
Jerry dispensed
with all that "master" stuff.

01:09:55.504 --> 01:09:57.798
Ed, if you have a problem,
just keep it with me, okay?

01:09:57.923 --> 01:10:02.762
Oh, do I got a problem.
You let him get to me.

01:10:03.053 --> 01:10:05.431
You let him turn me into this.

01:10:08.601 --> 01:10:09.894
Stay away, demon.

01:10:10.019 --> 01:10:11.812
Is that itsy-bitsy little sticky for me?

01:10:11.937 --> 01:10:13.814
It's a crucifixion nail.
It's lethal to you.

01:10:13.939 --> 01:10:16.901
Yeah. That's old school. Nice!

01:10:17.026 --> 01:10:20.613
You're going to have to get
pretty close to use that thing, though.

01:10:26.535 --> 01:10:27.828
Oh, no, you don't.

01:10:27.953 --> 01:10:29.872
Come on! Let's go!

01:10:35.127 --> 01:10:37.463
Holy shit!

01:10:37.963 --> 01:10:40.007
You took my arm!

01:10:40.132 --> 01:10:43.135
Are you enjoying your panic room,
master of darkness?

01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:46.430
God, you are such a pussy. I love it!

01:10:46.555 --> 01:10:48.474
Come on!

01:10:50.976 --> 01:10:52.812
Oh, my God.

01:10:53.646 --> 01:10:56.440
- Oh, my God.
- Amy, listen to me.

01:10:56.565 --> 01:10:59.527
There's more than one way out,
and there's a million things to fight with.

01:10:59.652 --> 01:11:01.362
We're going to be okay. All right?

01:11:01.487 --> 01:11:04.490
- Yeah.
- Trust me. Come on.

01:11:06.992 --> 01:11:08.828
Come on!

01:11:11.288 --> 01:11:13.332
Damn it.

01:11:14.125 --> 01:11:17.336
Give it up, Chuck.

01:11:17.795 --> 01:11:20.965
If you hadn't turned out
to be such a dick,

01:11:21.090 --> 01:11:23.050
I might have tricked you out.

01:11:23.175 --> 01:11:26.303
We could have rocked
this evil shit together!

01:11:27.179 --> 01:11:29.140
Sign in, please.

01:11:29.265 --> 01:11:33.978
Sign in, all right?
I'm talking to you!

01:11:34.645 --> 01:11:36.856
I need you to sign in.
No exceptions...

01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:53.456
I expected more of a fight
from you, Brewster.

01:11:53.622 --> 01:11:56.625
Girl's made you lazy in the head.

01:11:57.168 --> 01:11:59.462
Pussy will do that.

01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:04.341
I can hear you breathing.

01:12:05.050 --> 01:12:08.137
It's really fucking cool.

01:12:09.889 --> 01:12:12.683
I can feel you.

01:12:13.017 --> 01:12:15.519
I can taste you.

01:12:16.562 --> 01:12:18.481
You're so...

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:23.027
Fuck!

01:12:23.152 --> 01:12:25.029
Come on!

01:12:27.239 --> 01:12:29.825
Not so fast, Chuck.

01:12:33.245 --> 01:12:35.539
We got some catching up to do,
my friend.

01:12:35.664 --> 01:12:39.585
Amy, go. Amy, please go!

01:12:45.925 --> 01:12:50.054
It's just you and me now, buddy.
Mano a mano.

01:12:50.179 --> 01:12:52.765
Let's do this.

01:12:56.102 --> 01:12:58.145
Nice weapon there, Squid Boy.

01:12:58.270 --> 01:12:59.313
Ed...

01:12:59.438 --> 01:13:01.148
Not going to do you much good, though,

01:13:01.273 --> 01:13:04.902
because I'm a goddamn
killing machine.

01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:19.458
Come on. It's like
you're not even trying.

01:13:46.986 --> 01:13:49.321
I'm so glad you're here.

01:14:08.966 --> 01:14:10.885
Werewolves.

01:14:16.515 --> 01:14:18.476
Vampires.

01:14:40.206 --> 01:14:43.501
Bone is a motherfucker, Chuckles.

01:14:44.710 --> 01:14:46.837
It's hard to cut.

01:14:52.426 --> 01:14:53.761
Is this weird for you?

01:14:53.886 --> 01:14:56.680
Because I'm feeling
really homo right about now.

01:15:01.852 --> 01:15:03.854
Fuck!

01:15:13.406 --> 01:15:15.866
Bimbo's got some juice.

01:15:25.209 --> 01:15:27.086
Jerry's here.

01:15:30.423 --> 01:15:32.758
Do it, Charley.

01:15:34.135 --> 01:15:37.430
Charley, do it now!

01:15:48.941 --> 01:15:52.069
It's okay, Charley. It's okay.

01:16:01.787 --> 01:16:06.000
Come on. I found the stairs.
We have to go. Come on.

01:16:06.959 --> 01:16:08.794
Come on.

01:16:29.148 --> 01:16:31.025
Shit.

01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:42.912
Come on.

01:16:43.037 --> 01:16:45.706
Wait. He can't kill us, not in here.

01:16:45.831 --> 01:16:50.127
Really? Look around. Do you think
any of these people are going to notice?

01:16:50.836 --> 01:16:52.963
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, God.

01:17:09.188 --> 01:17:12.358
It's tequila mad T-shirts!

01:17:19.865 --> 01:17:24.328
- Amy!
- Charley!

01:17:24.453 --> 01:17:26.497
Amy!

01:17:36.132 --> 01:17:38.217
Amy!

01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:43.264
Charley!

01:17:43.389 --> 01:17:45.266
Amy!

01:17:47.059 --> 01:17:48.936
Now that is what I'm talking about!

01:17:49.061 --> 01:17:52.064
Can you help me? Please?

01:17:56.068 --> 01:17:57.945
Charley's going to come.
He's gonna find me.

01:17:58.070 --> 01:18:00.197
I'm counting on it.

01:18:00.781 --> 01:18:04.702
You'll see. You just need a taste.

01:18:09.081 --> 01:18:11.167
It could be like a dream.

01:18:21.385 --> 01:18:23.262
Amy!

01:18:23.596 --> 01:18:25.389
- How did you get in here?
- Listen, man! Listen to me!

01:18:25.514 --> 01:18:28.768
He's dangerous. You have to help me.
That guy's going to kill her.

01:18:28.893 --> 01:18:30.936
Yeah, she looks to be liking it, then.

01:18:31.061 --> 01:18:33.939
No, man. Listen,
you don't understand!

01:18:43.574 --> 01:18:45.451
Attagirl.

01:18:48.454 --> 01:18:51.499
- ID, then you can...
- I don't have ID! There's no time!

01:18:51.624 --> 01:18:54.627
Amy! Amy!

01:19:06.806 --> 01:19:09.725
Amy! No! No!

01:19:10.392 --> 01:19:13.896
No! Amy!

01:19:31.664 --> 01:19:33.874
Shit! How did you get in here?

01:19:33.999 --> 01:19:37.878
Security is a little lax since everybody
got their throat torn out.

01:19:38.003 --> 01:19:40.089
You, too? Has he turned you?

01:19:40.464 --> 01:19:43.008
Check your monitor, man.

01:19:49.098 --> 01:19:53.519
I don't know if Amy's alive
or dead or turned, but he got her.

01:19:54.186 --> 01:19:57.231
I'm going to end him,
or he's going to end me.

01:19:57.356 --> 01:20:00.526
That's how it's going to be,
and you're gonna come with me.

01:20:04.655 --> 01:20:07.074
Don't you understand this yet?
There will be no fighting.

01:20:07.199 --> 01:20:10.286
There will only be surviving.

01:20:10.453 --> 01:20:12.037
- Maybe.
- Really?

01:20:12.163 --> 01:20:13.581
You think if you live and we all die,

01:20:13.706 --> 01:20:16.041
you'll be able to
get us out of your head?

01:20:16.167 --> 01:20:20.296
No, I know I won't.
I never could after the first time.

01:20:20.963 --> 01:20:23.382
So I told myself I made it up.

01:20:24.133 --> 01:20:28.888
I was a kid. Figured it was easier
to believe in monsters.

01:20:30.556 --> 01:20:32.516
Made what up?

01:20:34.685 --> 01:20:38.063
The vampire that killed my parents,

01:20:38.230 --> 01:20:40.357
but not me.

01:20:41.233 --> 01:20:44.570
You think I collected all this stuff
because it was bitching?

01:20:44.695 --> 01:20:48.491
Come with me. We'll go in at dawn.
He's got to rest some time.

01:20:49.075 --> 01:20:54.038
The only reason I survived the last time
is because I had the sense to hide.

01:20:54.163 --> 01:20:58.250
If you want to be a dead hero,
good for you. I'm out.

01:20:59.543 --> 01:21:03.422
You think I'm a coward.
I'm not. I'm a realist.

01:21:04.423 --> 01:21:07.218
So you just bail on people.

01:21:07.384 --> 01:21:10.971
Hey, I get it.
My dad was like that.

01:21:11.097 --> 01:21:15.267
But I don't want to live till tomorrow
if you're the kind of man I'm going to be.

01:21:20.439 --> 01:21:23.109
Hang on. Wait.

01:21:26.237 --> 01:21:28.364
Blessed by Saint Michael.

01:21:29.782 --> 01:21:34.286
You kill your vampire with this, it's
supposed to change his victims back.

01:21:37.289 --> 01:21:39.792
Maybe you can still save your girlfriend.

01:21:40.793 --> 01:21:43.129
If it's for real.

01:21:44.463 --> 01:21:46.632
You got a plan?

01:21:46.882 --> 01:21:48.342
There's no guarantee he'll be sleeping.

01:21:48.467 --> 01:21:51.470
To stake him, you got to get close.

01:21:54.473 --> 01:21:56.308
Torch him.

01:21:56.725 --> 01:22:00.062
A vampire on fire
is not thinking clearly.

01:22:00.646 --> 01:22:05.443
If he's on fire, how do I get
close enough to stake him?

01:22:11.407 --> 01:22:13.617
Fuck.

01:22:53.491 --> 01:22:55.701
I'm going to kill a vampire.

01:22:56.327 --> 01:22:58.704
Good for you.

01:23:49.839 --> 01:23:52.091
Amy! Amy!

01:23:52.758 --> 01:23:55.136
- Amy! Amy!
- Charley!

01:23:55.261 --> 01:23:57.805
- You all right?
- Hey. Yeah.

01:23:57.930 --> 01:24:00.766
- Hang on. I'm going to get you out.
- Hurry.

01:24:04.687 --> 01:24:07.231
Shit. Shit.

01:24:09.108 --> 01:24:11.527
Amy! Amy?

01:24:12.862 --> 01:24:16.407
- Fuck!
- Sorry.

01:24:18.284 --> 01:24:21.036
I guess I don't want to be
a man like me, either.

01:24:25.249 --> 01:24:27.293
Let's kill something.

01:24:29.628 --> 01:24:32.256
Floor trap. I use them all the time.

01:24:32.381 --> 01:24:34.341
What do you think is down there?

01:24:34.467 --> 01:24:36.510
There's only one way to find out.

01:24:36.635 --> 01:24:38.304
You're going down?

01:24:38.429 --> 01:24:42.975
See that? Like a great date.
You get me drunk, I'll try anything.

01:25:04.246 --> 01:25:07.166
Peter. Peter.

01:25:21.013 --> 01:25:25.976
Oh, shit.
I may not be drunk enough for this.

01:25:31.690 --> 01:25:33.859
After you.

01:26:11.063 --> 01:26:12.940
Help!

01:26:17.528 --> 01:26:19.989
You know this is a trap, right?

01:26:20.114 --> 01:26:22.283
I'm counting on it.

01:26:49.477 --> 01:26:51.395
Fuck!

01:27:03.365 --> 01:27:05.493
She's all yours.

01:27:09.455 --> 01:27:12.124
Look at you, all grown up.

01:27:13.667 --> 01:27:16.170
Welcome to Fright Night...

01:27:17.630 --> 01:27:19.924
for real!

01:27:25.846 --> 01:27:28.015
Oh, fuck.

01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:33.687
You've got your mother's eyes.

01:27:36.565 --> 01:27:39.026
And your father's aim.

01:27:41.070 --> 01:27:42.863
Better.

01:27:42.988 --> 01:27:44.865
Fuck!

01:27:47.034 --> 01:27:48.911
Amy!

01:28:07.513 --> 01:28:09.390
Ow!

01:28:12.685 --> 01:28:14.687
Really?

01:28:16.856 --> 01:28:19.191
A pebble? That's it?

01:28:24.530 --> 01:28:27.116
Oh, shit.

01:28:46.135 --> 01:28:48.137
Fuck!

01:28:50.306 --> 01:28:54.268
You know you should have
saved me, Charley.

01:28:54.435 --> 01:28:57.938
There's still time. All right?

01:29:04.695 --> 01:29:07.948
He's inside me now.

01:29:26.383 --> 01:29:28.636
Fucking eBay!

01:29:32.098 --> 01:29:34.266
I'll be the best you ever had.

01:29:34.391 --> 01:29:38.145
The only you ever had.

01:29:39.688 --> 01:29:44.944
Charley, we could be together forever.

01:30:02.253 --> 01:30:04.130
Shit!

01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:24.275
- You missed.
- I know.

01:30:55.097 --> 01:30:57.975
- How you holding up?
- Fucking great.

01:30:59.185 --> 01:31:02.313
- Mark?
- You're dead now, asshole.

01:31:07.401 --> 01:31:09.278
What were you thinking, Charley?

01:31:09.403 --> 01:31:13.699
That you were just going to walk in here
with your little crossbow

01:31:13.824 --> 01:31:17.036
and put to bed 400 years of survival?

01:31:17.161 --> 01:31:20.372
No, Charley. Not likely.

01:31:21.457 --> 01:31:23.834
You smell that?

01:31:24.710 --> 01:31:26.837
It's your fear.

01:31:29.507 --> 01:31:31.509
It's intoxicating.

01:31:31.634 --> 01:31:36.639
It's a very specific scent, Charley.

01:31:48.526 --> 01:31:51.404
Amy's scent,

01:31:51.821 --> 01:31:55.491
now that was exquisite.

01:31:55.866 --> 01:32:00.162
It's all gone now, Charley.

01:32:02.498 --> 01:32:05.084
She's something, isn't she?

01:32:05.835 --> 01:32:09.338
I have to thank you
for bringing her to me.

01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:13.634
Well, she makes me feel young again.

01:32:14.802 --> 01:32:16.178
I'm smoking.

01:32:16.303 --> 01:32:19.140
Yeah, you're turning.

01:32:19.849 --> 01:32:22.351
You can't stay there forever, Charley.

01:32:22.518 --> 01:32:26.313
The sun's got to go down,
but we can wait.

01:32:37.658 --> 01:32:39.618
That's rough.

01:33:05.770 --> 01:33:07.730
Got a light?

01:33:15.613 --> 01:33:17.573
That's your plan?

01:33:18.616 --> 01:33:21.410
Actually, it's your plan.

01:33:26.999 --> 01:33:28.876
Fuck.

01:34:23.472 --> 01:34:25.641
Fuck you!

01:34:35.359 --> 01:34:38.571
Charley! In the heart!

01:35:29.914 --> 01:35:31.874
Charley? Charley, come on.

01:35:31.999 --> 01:35:33.834
Come on, Charley!

01:35:33.959 --> 01:35:36.378
Charley, come on.
Come on, come on.

01:35:36.504 --> 01:35:38.672
Wake up. Wake up.

01:35:38.923 --> 01:35:41.592
Come on, you little prick.

01:35:42.301 --> 01:35:44.178
Charley!

01:35:56.816 --> 01:36:01.487
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:36:03.155 --> 01:36:05.157
You okay?

01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:08.119
Yeah.

01:36:08.953 --> 01:36:10.913
Are you?

01:36:13.999 --> 01:36:16.168
Yeah, I'm all right.

01:36:19.171 --> 01:36:21.173
You little shit.

01:36:21.674 --> 01:36:25.803
Next time you're going to use my plan,
give me a heads-up first.

01:36:34.145 --> 01:36:36.439
That was a fucked-up night.

01:36:57.168 --> 01:36:59.128
Are you sure?

01:37:00.171 --> 01:37:02.047
Yeah.

01:37:08.596 --> 01:37:10.639
One second.

01:37:11.724 --> 01:37:13.058
Hello?

01:37:13.184 --> 01:37:16.812
Hey, it's me. Just checking in.
What are you up to?

01:37:20.733 --> 01:37:21.776
Nothing, nothing.

01:37:21.901 --> 01:37:23.736
- What are you doing?
- Just did a little shopping

01:37:23.861 --> 01:37:25.738
- for the new house.
- Shopping? Nice.

01:37:25.863 --> 01:37:29.575
Something actually just came up,
and I have to go.

01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:30.743
You okay?

01:37:30.868 --> 01:37:32.661
Yeah, I'm good. Are you all right?

01:37:32.787 --> 01:37:34.789
Yeah, monster free.

01:37:34.914 --> 01:37:37.500
Good. Monster free is good.
I'll talk to you later, okay?

01:37:37.625 --> 01:37:39.543
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

01:37:40.544 --> 01:37:42.838
If you're naked,
I'm absolutely going to look.

01:37:42.963 --> 01:37:44.882
Dude! Dude!

01:37:45.007 --> 01:37:49.428
I know. Sorry. I left my phone.

01:37:49.553 --> 01:37:52.014
I'm not looking. I promise. See?

01:37:52.139 --> 01:37:55.810
I can't see a thing. All right.
That's it. I'm out of here.

01:37:55.935 --> 01:37:58.479
It's all yours.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

01:37:58.604 --> 01:38:00.106
That doesn't narrow it down.

01:38:00.231 --> 01:38:04.068
There's, like, mini golf and sushi.
Carry on!

01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:10.157
Will you promise me,
now we'll finally be alone?

01:38:10.282 --> 01:38:11.617
I promise.

01:38:11.742 --> 01:38:15.538
- Promise?
- I promise, promise, promise.
