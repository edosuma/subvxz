00:01.735 --> 00:04.138

COVERING THE YANKEES.

00:04.172 --> 00:06.140
YEAH, I KNOW.

00:06.174 --> 00:07.408
HE'S BEEN GONE
FOR FOUR DAYS,

00:07.441 --> 00:09.510
AND HE'S 16 MINUTES LATE.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.314
- HEY!

00:13.347 --> 00:14.415
- GRAB THAT, RAY.

00:14.448 --> 00:16.250

00:27.861 --> 00:28.629

00:39.607 --> 00:42.776
[kids crying]

00:42.810 --> 00:44.212
- OKAY...

00:44.245 --> 00:46.614
COOKIE, COOKIE,

00:46.647 --> 00:48.716

00:48.749 --> 00:50.784
[all stop crying]

00:53.821 --> 00:55.289
[sighs]

00:55.323 --> 00:56.290
HI, HONEY.

00:56.324 --> 00:58.058
- HI.

01:03.231 --> 01:04.332
- HI, I'M RAY.

01:04.365 --> 01:05.799
I LIVE HERE IN LONG ISLAND

01:05.833 --> 01:08.402
WITH MY WIFE, DEBRA,

01:08.436 --> 01:09.803
MY FIVE-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER,

01:09.837 --> 01:12.540
AND TWIN
ALMOST-TWO-YEAR-OLD BOYS.

01:12.573 --> 01:15.343
MY PARENTS LIVE
ACROSS THE STREET.

01:15.376 --> 01:16.710
THAT'S RIGHT.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.712
THE TRUTH IS,
I'D DO ANYTHING FOR MY FAMILY.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.752
AND...DONE.

01:24.785 --> 01:27.355
OH, NO.

01:28.756 --> 01:31.159
UNH!
DEBRA!

01:31.192 --> 01:32.693
HONEY!

01:32.726 --> 01:36.130
SOMEBODY!
CALL MY FATHER!

01:36.164 --> 01:37.165
I'M HYPERVENTILATING!

01:43.271 --> 01:45.406
- OH, HONEY,

01:45.439 --> 01:47.341
I DON'T KNOW HOW I SURVIVED
FOUR DAYS BY MYSELF.

01:47.375 --> 01:48.509
- I KNOW.
I KNOW.

01:48.542 --> 01:49.643
HEY, NOBODY HATES

01:49.677 --> 01:52.280
GOING ON THE ROAD
MORE THAN ME.

01:52.313 --> 01:54.515
IT'S MISERABLE
FOR ME OUT THERE.

01:54.548 --> 01:57.218
HEY, LOOK AT THIS.
CAL RIPKEN SIGNED MY HAT.

01:57.251 --> 01:58.719
- OH, THAT'S GREAT.
LOOK AT THIS.

01:58.752 --> 02:02.423
GREGORY SPIT UP
ON MY SHIRT.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.424
- I'M NOT TRADING.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.293
- OKAY.

02:05.326 --> 02:07.228
JUST BE HAPPY YOU MADE IT
HOME FOR MY BIRTHDAY.

02:07.261 --> 02:08.662
THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY.
- WELL, WHAT?

02:08.696 --> 02:10.398
OF COURSE I MADE IT HOME
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY.

02:10.431 --> 02:12.466
ARE YOU KIDDING?
YOUR BIRTHDAY IS...

02:12.500 --> 02:13.567
- SUNDAY.
- SUNDAY.

02:13.601 --> 02:15.369
THAT'S RIGHT.
BIG PARTY.

02:15.403 --> 02:16.870
- AND HOW OLD AM I
GOING TO BE?

02:16.904 --> 02:18.172
- I KNOW THAT.

02:18.206 --> 02:20.674
- RAY...HOW OLD?

02:20.708 --> 02:24.645
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
I JUST HAVE TO BACKTRACK.

02:24.678 --> 02:27.181
LET'S SEE,
WHEN I PROPOSED, YOU WERE 23.

02:27.215 --> 02:28.582
- MM-HMM.
- YOU SAID NO.

02:28.616 --> 02:30.584
- RIGHT.

02:30.618 --> 02:32.886
THEN I PROPOSED.
YOU WERE 24.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.688
- NO AGAIN.
- NO AGAIN.

02:34.722 --> 02:36.357
RIGHT.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.791
THEN I TOOK A YEAR OFF
TO REGROUP.

02:37.825 --> 02:39.193
- YUP.

02:39.227 --> 02:40.761
- THEN I CAME BACK
WITH A JOB.

02:40.794 --> 02:43.397
BOOM!
MARRIED.

02:43.431 --> 02:47.668
THAT WOULD MAKE YOU...
32...

02:47.701 --> 02:48.969
ISH.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.471
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL ACCEPT THAT.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.806
- GOOD, 'CAUSE...
BIG PARTY.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.508
- NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T WANT THE PARTY.

02:54.542 --> 02:55.709
I JUST WANT
A NICE DAY AT HOME

02:55.743 --> 02:58.512
WITH MY FAVORITE HUSBAND
AND MY KIDS, OKAY?

02:58.546 --> 03:02.483
- OKAY, AND I GUESS MY PARENTS
AND MY BROTHER TOO, RIGHT?

03:04.485 --> 03:06.987
MY PARENTS
AND MY BROTHER?

03:07.020 --> 03:08.456
WHAT?

03:08.489 --> 03:10.724
- RAY,
IT'S JUST THAT--

03:10.758 --> 03:12.726
LOOK, YOU KNOW
I LOVE THEM.

03:12.760 --> 03:14.428
THEY'RE MY FAMILY TOO.

03:14.462 --> 03:17.465
BUT I WAS WONDERING
IF PERHAPS

03:17.498 --> 03:19.500
WE WOULDN'T HAVE
THEM OVER ON SUNDAY.

03:19.533 --> 03:20.634
- WELL, WHY NOT?

03:20.668 --> 03:22.303
- WELL, IT'S JUST,
YOU KNOW, HONEY,

03:22.336 --> 03:25.706
EVERY DAY THAT YOU WERE GONE,
THEY DROPPED BY.

03:25.739 --> 03:27.541
AND THEN YOUR DAD IS ALWAYS
WAKING UP THE KIDS.

03:27.575 --> 03:29.410
AND NOW THEY DON'T
EVEN CALL FIRST.

03:29.443 --> 03:30.911
- WELL, THEY LIVE
ACROSS THE STREET.

03:30.944 --> 03:32.680
WHY SHOULD THEY CALL?
IT'S QUICKER JUST TO COME BY.

03:32.713 --> 03:35.483
- I KNOW.

03:35.516 --> 03:36.617
- IT'S LIKE
WE'RE ON THE WAY.

03:36.650 --> 03:38.952
- NO, NO, NO,
WE ARE THE WAY.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.721
WE ARE WHERE
THEY'RE GOING.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.590
- YOU SEE, NOW YOU'RE
EXAGGERATING A LITTLE.

03:42.623 --> 03:44.325
- YOU'RE HOME.

03:45.726 --> 03:46.860
- HI, MOM.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.796
- HI, I SAW YOUR CAR
PULL UP BEFORE.

03:48.829 --> 03:49.797
YOU DIDN'T CALL.

03:49.830 --> 03:52.333
- OH...

03:52.366 --> 03:53.567
- HI, DEBRA,

03:53.601 --> 03:55.636
I BROUGHT YOU SOME BAKING SODA
FOR YOUR FRIDGE.

03:55.669 --> 03:58.972
I SMELLED SOMETHING
QUESTIONABLE.

03:59.006 --> 04:00.341
- FROM ACROSS
THE STREET?

04:00.374 --> 04:04.578
- NO, WHEN I WAS HERE
YESTERDAY.

04:04.612 --> 04:06.514
- OKAY.

04:06.547 --> 04:08.015
- OOH, IT'S WORSE!

04:08.048 --> 04:09.317
- OH, NOW, THAT'S JUST--

04:09.350 --> 04:11.352
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

04:11.385 --> 04:13.487
MA, LISTEN, MA,
WE CAN BUY OUR OWN BAKING SODA.

04:13.521 --> 04:15.989
- I KNOW, SWEETIE,
BUT YOU DON'T.

04:16.023 --> 04:18.459
OOH, WHAT HAVE WE HERE?

04:18.492 --> 04:20.828
OH, I'LL GET YOU
SOME CLUB SODA FOR THAT TOO.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.796
- NO, MA,
WE HAVE CLUB SODA, MA.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.298
- NO, YOUR FATHER
FINISHED IT.

04:24.332 --> 04:26.334
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

04:30.103 --> 04:33.273
- OH, IT COMES
FROM LOVE.

04:35.876 --> 04:38.412
LOOK, IF YOU WANT, MAYBE
I'LL TALK TO MY FATHER ABOUT IT.

04:38.446 --> 04:40.047
- WELL, WHILE
YOU'RE TALKING TO HIM,

04:40.080 --> 04:42.950
WOULD YOU MIND MENTIONING
THE ANSWERING MACHINE?

04:42.983 --> 04:44.952
- IS HE PLAYING BACK
THE MESSAGES AGAIN?

04:44.985 --> 04:45.953
I CHANGED THE CODE.

04:45.986 --> 04:48.722
- WELL, HE CRACKED IT.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.524
- I HOPE EVERYONE'S
DOING GOOD.

04:50.558 --> 04:51.992
AND, DEBRA, YOU OUGHT TO CALL
LINDA BACK.

04:52.025 --> 04:53.461
SHE SOUNDS LIKE SHE HAD

04:53.494 --> 04:55.028
A VERY INTERESTING VISIT
TO THE GYNO.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.465
[machine beeps]

04:57.498 --> 05:00.701
- THAT'S FUNNY.
THAT'S--

05:00.734 --> 05:03.504
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT
FOR EVERYBODY, OKAY?

05:03.537 --> 05:05.506
LOOK, HE'S FOOLING AROUND.

05:05.539 --> 05:06.574
THAT'S WHAT HE DOES.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.442
HE'S LIKE
ONE OF THOSE GUYS,

05:08.476 --> 05:09.843
WHAT DO YOU
CALL THEM?

05:09.877 --> 05:12.480
AN IDIOT.

05:12.513 --> 05:14.648
- BUT DO THEY HAVE TO BRING
YOUR BROTHER OVER?

05:14.682 --> 05:16.550
- MY BROTHER
LIVES WITH THEM.

05:16.584 --> 05:17.851
HE DOESN'T LIKE
STAYING ALONE.

05:17.885 --> 05:20.454
- HE'S 40, RAY.

05:20.488 --> 05:23.524
- COME ON,
HE LOVES THE KIDS.

05:23.557 --> 05:24.525
- IT'S JUST, LIKE--
THE WAY ROBERT EATS,

05:24.558 --> 05:26.059
YOU KNOW, THE WAY
HE HAS TO TOUCH EVERY BITE

05:26.093 --> 05:28.696
TO HIS CHIN
BEFORE HE PUTS IT IN HIS MOUTH.

05:28.729 --> 05:30.130
THAT'S--
IT'S WEIRD.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.400
- WHAT?
THAT'S AN IDIOSYNCRASY.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.468
IT'S LIKE WHEN HE'S COUNTING
AND HE GETS TO THE NUMBER 12

05:34.502 --> 05:37.004
AND HE HAS TO TAKE
HIS SHOES OFF.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.872
EVERYBODY HAS THOSE.

05:38.906 --> 05:41.108
- HOW'D HE EVER BECOME
A POLICE SERGEANT?

05:41.141 --> 05:42.410
- 'CAUSE HE'S A GOOD COP,

05:42.443 --> 05:45.513
AND THEY DIDN'T
MAKE HIM COUNT...

05:45.546 --> 05:47.715
OR EAT.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.450
- I DON'T KNOW, RAY,
IT'S JUST THAT IT'S--

05:49.483 --> 05:51.151
YOU KNOW, EVERY DAY,

05:51.184 --> 05:51.852
AND BETWEEN THEM
AND THE KIDS, I JUST FEEL--

05:51.885 --> 05:53.754
- LUCKY?
- RAY--

05:53.787 --> 05:55.656
- ALL RIGHT.
LOOK, ALL RIGHT.

05:55.689 --> 05:56.924
I'M HOME NOW.
MAYBE YOU NEED A BREAK.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.091
I'LL TELL YOU,
WHY DON'T YOU GO OUT

05:58.125 --> 05:59.693
WITH LINDA
TOMORROW NIGHT?

05:59.727 --> 06:01.128
- WHAT, AND LEAVE THE KIDS
WITH YOUR PARENTS?

06:01.161 --> 06:02.396
- NO, I'LL DO THE KIDS.

06:02.430 --> 06:03.597
- OH--
[blows raspberry]

06:03.631 --> 06:06.400
- OH, I CAN'T DO THAT?

06:06.434 --> 06:07.701
OH, HEY,
HOW ABOUT THE TIME

06:07.735 --> 06:10.037
YOU WENT TO YOUR AUNT'S
FOR THREE DAYS?

06:10.070 --> 06:11.071
- I TOOK THE KIDS WITH ME.

06:11.104 --> 06:13.140
- YEAH, BUT I FED MYSELF.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.411
- HEY, RAY!

06:17.445 --> 06:20.180
RAY!
- COME ON, KEEP IT DOWN, LEO.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.181
I JUST
GOT THEM TO SLEEP.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.716
- I'M SORRY.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.452
HEY, WANT TO GO OVER TO NEMO'S,
GET A SLICE?

06:24.485 --> 06:27.821
- LEO, MY KIDS
AREN'T FISH, OKAY?

06:30.591 --> 06:33.427
YOU CAN'T JUST SPRINKLE FOOD
OVER THE CRIB AND LEAVE.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.196
- CALL YOUR MOTHER.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.998
- NO, I CAN'T;
DEBRA'S GOT THIS THING

06:38.031 --> 06:40.100
ABOUT THEM COMING OVER
TOO MUCH LATELY.

06:40.133 --> 06:43.637
- I GOT THE CLUB SODA.

06:43.671 --> 06:46.006
HI, LEO, HI.

06:46.039 --> 06:49.443
- HEY, MS. B.
- HOW YOU DOING?

06:49.477 --> 06:50.978
- MS. B, WOULD YOU MIND
MAYBE SITTING WITH THE KIDS

06:51.011 --> 06:52.580
FOR A LITTLE BIT
WHILE RAYMOND AND I

06:52.613 --> 06:53.681
WENT OUT
AND GOT SOME PIZZA?

06:53.714 --> 06:55.549
- NO, NO.
- NO, NOT AT ALL.

06:55.583 --> 06:56.917
BUT WHERE'S DEBRA?

06:56.950 --> 06:58.919
- SHE WENT TO THE MOVIES
WITH LINDA.

06:58.952 --> 07:00.954
- THE MOVIES?
- YES.

07:00.988 --> 07:03.891
- SOME PEOPLE
GET TO LIVE IT UP.

07:03.924 --> 07:04.992
GO AHEAD.
YOU GUYS, GO AHEAD.

07:05.025 --> 07:07.094
GO, GET YOUR PIZZA.
YOU DESERVE IT.

07:07.127 --> 07:08.662
- YOU ROCK, MRS. B.

07:08.696 --> 07:09.830
- [muttering]

07:09.863 --> 07:11.532
- COME ON, LET'S GO.

07:11.565 --> 07:12.666
- NO, NO.

07:12.700 --> 07:14.201
NO, NO.
LISTEN.

07:14.234 --> 07:17.170
DEBRA DOESN'T WANT ME
TO LEAVE THEM WITH...

07:17.204 --> 07:19.106
OUT ME.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.207
- YOU'RE LEAVING THEM
WITH ME.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.609
THEY'RE SLEEPING.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.010
GO ON.
GO WITH YOUR FRIEND.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.578
- WELL, I WANT TO,
BUT I CAN'T.

07:24.612 --> 07:26.179
- WE KNOW, YOU'RE WORRIED.
YOU'RE CONCERNED.

07:26.213 --> 07:28.181
WE'RE ALL CRYING BUCKETS HERE.
COME ON, LET'S GO.

07:28.215 --> 07:29.517
- ALL RIGHT, IT'S 8:30.
ONE HOUR.

07:29.550 --> 07:30.784
WE'LL BE GONE ONE HOUR.

07:30.818 --> 07:33.220
- WOULD YOU GO?
COME ON, YOU'RE INSULTING ME.

07:33.253 --> 07:34.888
I RAISED YOU, DIDN'T I?

07:34.922 --> 07:37.057
- OH, GOD,
YOU RAISED ME--

07:52.706 --> 07:54.642
- HEY!
- OOH, FRANK, ROBBIE!

07:54.675 --> 07:56.209
YOU SCARED ME.

07:56.243 --> 07:58.278
- YOU DON'T LEAVE A NOTE?
YOU JUST LEAVE?

07:58.311 --> 07:59.780
WE'RE LOOKING
ALL OVER FOR YOU.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.014
- WHERE'D YOU LOOK?

08:01.048 --> 08:02.983
- WE THOUGHT
WE'D START HERE.

08:07.555 --> 08:08.589
- WHERE ARE THE KIDS?

08:08.622 --> 08:10.090
- OH, NO,
THEY'RE SLEEPING.

08:10.123 --> 08:12.225
- HEY, I JUST WANT TO SEE THEM.
COME ON, IT'S EARLY.

08:12.259 --> 08:14.762
I JUST WANT TO SEE THE KIDS.
THEY CAN SLEEP WHEN WE GO.

08:14.795 --> 08:16.029
- NO, NO, NO.

08:16.063 --> 08:18.031
YOU WANT TO SEE
SOMETHING, HUH?

08:18.065 --> 08:23.003
A $120 RECEIPT
FROM VICTORIA'S SECRETS.

08:23.036 --> 08:26.239
- HOLY CRAP!

08:26.273 --> 08:28.709
WHAT THE HELL'S
A "BUSTIER"?

08:28.742 --> 08:31.979
- IT'S A THING, YOU KNOW,
TO PULL YOU IN HERE.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.916
- WHEN DID HE GET THIS?

08:35.949 --> 08:38.218
- OH, THAT'S AN AWARD
YOUR BROTHER GOT

08:38.251 --> 08:40.721
FOR HIS SPORTS COLUMN.

08:40.754 --> 08:42.222
- IT NEVER ENDS
FOR RAYMOND.

08:42.255 --> 08:44.291
- OH, POOR ROBBIE.

08:44.324 --> 08:48.128
- EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND.

08:48.161 --> 08:51.331
I GO TO WORK,
PEOPLE SHOOT AT ME.

08:51.364 --> 08:54.635
RAY GOES TO WORK,
PEOPLE DO THE WAVE.

08:54.668 --> 08:56.336
THEN HE SITS DOWN,
HAS A HOT DOG,

08:56.369 --> 08:58.138
DOODLES
ON A PIECE OF PAPER,

08:58.171 --> 08:59.973
AND THEY GIVE HIM
A TROPHY.

09:02.643 --> 09:03.744
- TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

09:03.777 --> 09:07.114
I THINK THAT RAYMOND IS WASTING
HIS LIFE WRITING SPORTS.

09:07.147 --> 09:09.082
I MEAN, A WRITER SHOULD BE
WRITING SHORT STORIES

09:09.116 --> 09:12.085
AND POETRY.

09:12.119 --> 09:13.754
- DO YOU THINK
I'M WASTING MY LIFE?

09:18.659 --> 09:21.161
- WELL...IT'S DIFFERENT
WITH YOU, DEAR.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.899
- LOOK WHO'S UP.
- [wailing]

09:25.933 --> 09:28.836
- OOH, LOOK AT THAT.

09:31.839 --> 09:36.977
[Ally yelling,
banging pot]

09:39.412 --> 09:42.382
- OH, NO, NO, NO--
- HI, DADDY.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.217
- HEY, RAY, DO YOU WANT
TO WATCH THE GAME?

09:44.251 --> 09:46.854
- NO, NO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
EVERYBODY?

09:46.887 --> 09:48.021
DEBRA'S GOING TO BE--

09:48.055 --> 09:49.690
OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU,

09:49.723 --> 09:51.925
QUICKLY AND QUIETLY,
MOVE TO YOUR NEAREST EXITS.

09:51.959 --> 09:53.360
- IT'S THE FOURTH QUARTER.

09:53.393 --> 09:55.228
- DAD, PLEASE,
BUCKLE UP AND GO.

09:59.967 --> 10:02.302
- YOU KNOW, WHEN SOMEBODY
DOES YOU A FAVOR,

10:02.335 --> 10:03.771
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO SAY "THANK YOU."

10:03.804 --> 10:05.205
- THANK YOU, THANK YOU,
MOM AND DAD.

10:05.238 --> 10:06.373
YOU'RE WONDERFUL
GRANDPARENTS.

10:06.406 --> 10:09.176
YOU'RE NOT EVIL AT ALL.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.144
- LET ME JUST SMELL
THEIR HEADS ONCE MORE.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.280
- DAD, PLEASE,
PLEASE, DAD--

10:13.313 --> 10:15.248
- MMM, IT'S THE FOUNTAIN
OF YOUTH.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.817
I'M SUCKING IN
THAT YOUTH.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.051
- I'M BEGGING YOU, DAD.

10:18.085 --> 10:19.386
I'M BEGGING YOU,
LET GO OF THEIR HEADS.

10:19.419 --> 10:21.254
LET GO OF THEIR HEADS.
I'LL GIVE YOU MONEY.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.856
DO YOU WANT MONEY?
- HEY, SAVE YOUR MONEY.

10:22.890 --> 10:23.957
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED IT.

10:23.991 --> 10:25.793
VICTORIA'S NOT
A SECRET ANYMORE.

10:25.826 --> 10:27.294
- WHAT?
WHAT?

10:27.327 --> 10:28.929
- WE'LL SEE YOU SUNDAY
AT DEBRA'S PARTY.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.130
- OKAY.
THANKS AGAIN.

10:30.163 --> 10:33.233
THANKS AGAIN, MA.

10:33.266 --> 10:35.635
- NICE TROPHY.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.075
- HEY.
- HEY.

10:42.109 --> 10:43.376
- HEY, I WAS JUST
CHECKING THE KIDS.

10:43.410 --> 10:45.145
- OH, GREAT.

10:45.178 --> 10:46.379
- STILL SLEEPING
LIKE LOGS.

10:46.413 --> 10:48.115
- OH.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.419
OH, MY GOSH.
LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

10:52.452 --> 10:53.987
- WHAT?

10:54.021 --> 10:56.023
- IT'S SPOTLESS!

10:56.056 --> 10:57.691
YOU CLEANED UP
FOR ME.

10:57.725 --> 10:59.727
- WELL,
YOU'RE NOT THE MAID.

10:59.760 --> 11:04.297
- OH, RAY,
OH, YOU ARE SO WONDERFUL.

11:04.331 --> 11:05.198
HEY, LISTEN,
I'M JUST GOING

11:05.232 --> 11:06.466
TO LOOK AT THE KIDS
REAL QUICK, OKAY?

11:06.499 --> 11:08.101
- OKAY.

11:14.307 --> 11:15.876
I THINK
I'M HAVING SEX.

11:21.048 --> 11:22.482
OH...

11:22.515 --> 11:24.785
GOOD OLD SEX.

11:24.818 --> 11:26.920
OH, YEAH.

11:26.954 --> 11:29.957
OH, I'M GOING
TO DO NEW STUFF.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.326
HI, HONEY.

11:35.262 --> 11:37.464
- UH, RAY...

11:37.497 --> 11:38.966
- WHAT?

11:38.999 --> 11:42.135
- WHY DO THE BOYS' HEADS
SMELL LIKE OLD SPICE?

11:43.804 --> 11:46.039
- WHAT?

11:46.073 --> 11:48.308
- YOUR FATHER WAS HERE

11:48.341 --> 11:51.912
AND SUCKING THE YOUTH
OUT OF THEIR HEADS AGAIN, HUH?

11:51.945 --> 11:55.148
AND YOUR BROTHER
WAS HERE TOO.

11:55.182 --> 11:59.853
JUST FOUND THIS FROOT LOOP
ON MATTHEW'S CHIN.

11:59.887 --> 12:01.855
ARE YOU GOING TO TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED HERE TONIGHT, RAY,

12:01.889 --> 12:02.956
OR DO I HAVE
TO CALL YOUR PARENTS?

12:02.990 --> 12:04.925
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.794
PLEASE, PLEASE, NO, NO,
DON'T CALL THE PARENTS, NO.

12:06.827 --> 12:09.229
OKAY, OKAY.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.031
I PUT THEM TO SLEEP.
- YEAH.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.400
- AND MY MOTHER CAME OVER,
AND THEN I WENT OUT WITH LEO.

12:13.433 --> 12:14.467
- WHAT?

12:14.501 --> 12:16.770
YOU LEFT THE KIDS
WITH YOUR MOM?

12:16.804 --> 12:18.405
- NO, MY FATHER AND BROTHER
WERE HERE TOO.

12:18.438 --> 12:19.572
- OH, WHAT?

12:19.606 --> 12:22.409
- THEN I GOT RID OF THEM,
AND THEN DID SOME CLEANING.

12:22.442 --> 12:25.145
HUH? YOU NOTICED
THE CLEANING DOWN THERE.

12:25.178 --> 12:26.947
- OKAY, WHY DID THEY
HAVE TO BE HERE?

12:26.980 --> 12:30.383
WHAT WAS SO IMPORTANT
THAT YOU HAD TO GO OUT FOR?

12:30.417 --> 12:31.451
- PIZZA.

12:31.484 --> 12:33.553
- PIZZA?
PIZZA?

12:33.586 --> 12:36.023
- DID YOU SEE THE MESS?
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN IT.

12:36.056 --> 12:37.024
THEY WOKE THE KIDS UP.

12:37.057 --> 12:38.926
- WHAT?
RAY!

12:38.959 --> 12:42.963
- OH, THE PIZZA
WASN'T EVEN GOOD.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.998
- YOU TOLD ME
THAT YOU WERE GOING TO STAY

12:45.032 --> 12:46.066
AND WATCH THE KIDS.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.534
- I KNOW.
I KNOW, BUT--

12:47.567 --> 12:49.069
- BUT WHAT?
BUT WHAT, RAY?

12:49.102 --> 12:50.270
- I DON'T KNOW.

12:50.303 --> 12:51.805
- I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING.

12:51.839 --> 12:54.041
YOUR FOLKS ARE NOT
COMING OVER ON SUNDAY.

12:54.074 --> 12:56.376
THAT IS MY BIRTHDAY,
AND I SHOULD BE ALLOWED

12:56.409 --> 12:57.444
ONE DAY OF PEACE
WITHOUT THEM.

12:57.477 --> 12:58.445
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:58.478 --> 12:59.913
I WANT YOU TO CALL THEM

12:59.947 --> 13:01.448
AND TELL THEM THAT
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT,

13:01.481 --> 13:02.883
BECAUSE THEY NEED
TO GET THE MESSAGE

13:02.916 --> 13:04.151
THAT WE HAVE
OUR OWN LIVES,

13:04.184 --> 13:06.119
AND WE'RE ENTITLED
TO A LITTLE PRIVACY.

13:06.153 --> 13:07.487
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.990
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
- SO YOU'LL TELL THEM?

13:10.023 --> 13:12.425
- I CAN'T DO THAT.

13:12.459 --> 13:16.163
- WHAT IS THIS HOLD
THEY HAVE ON YOU?

13:16.196 --> 13:18.031
I'M JUST ASKING YOU FOR ME.

13:18.065 --> 13:22.435
PLEASE, CAN WE CELEBRATE
MY BIRTHDAY ALONE?

13:22.469 --> 13:24.571
- I CAN'T UNINVITE THEM.

13:24.604 --> 13:25.372
- YOU CAN'T?

13:28.375 --> 13:30.577
WELL, THEN,
MAYBE I WON'T BE HERE.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.512
- NO, STOP IT.
DON'T!

13:32.545 --> 13:35.983
DON'T SLEEP
ON THE COUCH!

13:36.016 --> 13:38.418
I JUST CLEANED DOWN THERE!

13:43.924 --> 13:47.294
[knock on door]

13:47.327 --> 13:51.932
- OH, RAYMOND!
- HI.

13:51.965 --> 13:53.600
- COME IN, HONEY.

13:53.633 --> 13:55.535
YOUR BROTHER'S WORKING,
AND YOUR FATHER'S OUT

13:55.568 --> 13:58.338
BUYING ONE OF THOSE BALLS
FOR YOUR TOILET.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.473
SO I GOT THE WHOLE HOUSE
TO MYSELF.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.342
IS THAT MY LARGE FORK?

14:02.375 --> 14:03.911
- YEAH, YEAH, IT IS.
IT IS.

14:03.944 --> 14:05.946
THAT'S WHY I CAME BY HERE.
I WANTED TO RETURN THIS.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.380
- OH, WELL, I DIDN'T
WANT TO SAY ANYTHING,

14:07.414 --> 14:10.617
BUT THAT HAPPENS
TO BE A VERY GOOD FORK.

14:10.650 --> 14:12.385
YOU KNOW?
- I KNOW.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.888
THAT'S WHY IT TOOK SO LONG.
I LOVE IT.

14:17.024 --> 14:18.158
LISTEN, MA,
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU

14:18.191 --> 14:19.559
ABOUT DEBRA'S BIRTHDAY.

14:19.592 --> 14:21.094
- OH, MY GOD!

14:21.128 --> 14:22.629
TALK ABOUT BIRTHDAYS.

14:22.662 --> 14:25.165
YOUR BIRTHDAY GIFT TO ME
FINALLY CAME THIS MORNING.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.935
DID YOU KNOW YOU SENT ME
A BOX OF PEARS

14:27.968 --> 14:29.336
FROM A PLACE CALLED
FRUIT OF THE MONTH?

14:29.369 --> 14:30.537
- THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT.

14:30.570 --> 14:31.538
HOW ARE THEY?

14:31.571 --> 14:34.241
- OH, THEY'RE VERY NICE PEARS,

14:34.274 --> 14:36.576
BUT THERE'S
SO MANY OF THEM.

14:36.609 --> 14:39.312
THERE ARE
OVER A DOZEN PEARS.

14:39.346 --> 14:41.481
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
WITH ALL THOSE PEARS?

14:41.514 --> 14:43.583
- I THINK YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO EAT THEM, MA.

14:43.616 --> 14:44.651
- MYSELF?
- YOU.

14:44.684 --> 14:46.486
YOU AND DAD
AND ROBERT.

14:46.519 --> 14:49.522
- HOW MANY PEARS
CAN ROBERT EAT?

14:49.556 --> 14:51.424
LOOK, I APPRECIATE
THE THOUGHT, RAYMOND,

14:51.458 --> 14:52.525
BUT, PLEASE,
DON'T EVER SEND US

14:52.559 --> 14:54.227
ANY MORE FRUIT AGAIN, OKAY?

14:54.261 --> 14:55.628
THANKS.
THANKS, DARLING.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.965
- WELL, ANOTHER BOX
IS COMING NEXT MONTH.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.066
- WHAT?

14:59.099 --> 15:00.267
MORE PEARS?

15:00.300 --> 15:01.634
- NO.

15:01.668 --> 15:04.171
NO, IT'S A DIFFERENT FRUIT
EVERY MONTH.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.173
- EVERY MONTH?
- YES, YES!

15:06.206 --> 15:08.308
THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT
"FRUIT OF THE MONTH CLUB."

15:08.341 --> 15:10.177
- IT'S A CLUB?
OH, MY GOD.

15:10.210 --> 15:11.578
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO
WITH ALL THIS FRUIT?

15:11.611 --> 15:13.613
- WELL, MOST PEOPLE
LIKE IT, MA.

15:13.646 --> 15:15.482
YOU SHARE IT.
SHARE IT WITH ALL YOUR FRIENDS.

15:15.515 --> 15:16.549
- WHICH FRIENDS?

15:16.583 --> 15:18.185
- I DON'T KNOW.
LEE AND STAN.

15:18.218 --> 15:19.586
- LEE AND STAN
BUY THEIR OWN FRUIT.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.388
- THEN GIVE IT AWAY--

15:21.421 --> 15:24.091
- WHY DID YOU DO THIS TO ME?
- OH, MY GOD.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.225
- I CAN'T TALK.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.659
THERE'S TOO MUCH FRUIT
IN THE HOUSE!

15:26.693 --> 15:31.098
- OH, WHAT IS HAPPENING?

15:31.131 --> 15:33.066
I'M--I'M SORRY, MA.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.534
- HEY, MARIE.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.703
OH, RAY!

15:36.736 --> 15:38.638
- DO YOU KNOW THAT THE FRUIT
KEEPS COMING

15:38.671 --> 15:41.274
MONTH AFTER MONTH?

15:41.308 --> 15:43.276
HE'S GOT US
IN SOME KIND OF A CULT.

15:43.310 --> 15:46.646
- IT'S NOT A CULT, MA.
IT'S A CLUB.

15:46.679 --> 15:49.016
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
MONTH AFTER MONTH?

15:49.049 --> 15:50.483
FOR HOW LONG?

15:53.453 --> 15:55.288
- IT'S A YEAR.

15:55.322 --> 15:57.324
- MY GOD, ARE YOU
OUT OF YOUR MIND?

15:57.357 --> 16:00.527
- OH, ALL RIGHT,
I'M SO SORRY, DAD.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.296
- WHAT DO YOU THINK WE ARE,
INVALIDS?

16:03.330 --> 16:04.764
WE CAN'T GO OUT
AND GET OUR OWN FRUIT?

16:04.797 --> 16:06.166
- I TRIED TO TELL HIM.

16:06.199 --> 16:08.701
- ALL RIGHT, I'M CANCELING
THE FRUIT CLUB.

16:08.735 --> 16:09.769
- OH, GOOD.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.271
THANK YOU, RAYMOND.
THANK YOU.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.739
AND DON'T DO THAT AGAIN.

16:12.772 --> 16:15.208
- LIKE WE DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH PROBLEMS.

16:15.242 --> 16:17.477
- ALL RIGHT, OKAY, LISTEN,
I GOT TO TALK ABOUT THE PARTY.

16:17.510 --> 16:18.645
- OOH, THE PARTY.

16:18.678 --> 16:23.450
- YES, YES, YES, LISTEN,
I WAS THINKING--

16:23.483 --> 16:25.418
UH, THERE ISN'T
GOING TO BE A PARTY.

16:25.452 --> 16:26.453
- WHO'S DEAD?

16:26.486 --> 16:28.188
- NOBODY'S DEAD, DAD.

16:28.221 --> 16:29.489
WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A PARTY.

16:29.522 --> 16:30.590
- YOU GOT TO HAVE A PARTY.
I BAKED.

16:30.623 --> 16:32.359
I'VE NEVER HEARD
OF SUCH A THING.

16:32.392 --> 16:35.795
- WE'RE NOT HAVING A PARTY
BECAUSE I'M SURPRISING DEBRA.

16:35.828 --> 16:39.032
I'M TAKING HER TO...

16:39.066 --> 16:41.534
BEAR MOUNTAIN.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.303
- BEAR MOUNTAIN?
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.704
I WANT TO DO SOMETHING SPECIAL
FOR HER.

16:44.737 --> 16:46.206
THIS IS A SURPRISE,
ALL RIGHT?

16:46.239 --> 16:47.807
SO YOU CAN'T GO
TELLING HER ANYTHING.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.342
ALL RIGHT?
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

16:49.376 --> 16:51.044
- OKAY, WAIT.
WAIT JUST ONE MINUTE NOW.

16:51.078 --> 16:53.080
HERE.
WAIT.

16:53.113 --> 16:54.347
IT'S A LONG TRIP
TO BEAR MOUNTAIN.

16:54.381 --> 16:55.348
TAKE FRUIT.

16:55.382 --> 16:56.716
- OKAY, THANKS.

16:56.749 --> 16:58.485
HEY.
- HEY.

17:01.554 --> 17:04.157
RAYMOND GETS
THE PEARS TOO?

17:07.560 --> 17:09.296
- THEY ALL WENT DOWN
FOR A NAP.

17:09.329 --> 17:10.330
WHOO!

17:10.363 --> 17:11.564
PUTS THIS OVER THE TOP

17:11.598 --> 17:13.300
AS THE BEST BIRTHDAY
I HAVE EVER HAD.

17:13.333 --> 17:14.434
- NO, HEY, HEY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:14.467 --> 17:15.702
- JUST LETTING IN THE LIGHT.

17:15.735 --> 17:17.137
- IT'S STILL YOUR BIRTHDAY,
THOUGH.

17:17.170 --> 17:20.340
WE WANT TO HAVE
A NICE, COZY BIRTHDAY.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.275
HUH?
ISN'T THAT COZY?

17:22.309 --> 17:23.543
- [laughs]

17:23.576 --> 17:25.712
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE UP TO.

17:25.745 --> 17:27.847
- YOU DO?
- YEAH, COME HERE.

17:27.880 --> 17:32.385
- OH, YEAH,
THIS IS WHAT I'M UP TO.

17:32.419 --> 17:33.753
YEAH.

17:33.786 --> 17:38.358
I THOUGHT THIS ONLY HAPPENED
ON MY BIRTHDAY.

17:38.391 --> 17:41.728
- OH, RAY, I'M SO GLAD YOU SET
YOUR PARENTS STRAIGHT, HUH?

17:41.761 --> 17:43.496
DOESN'T IT FEEL GOOD
TO BE HONEST WITH THEM?

17:43.530 --> 17:45.265
- IT DOES.
IT DOES FEEL GOOD.

17:45.298 --> 17:47.500
NOT AS GOOD AS THIS,
THOUGH.

17:47.534 --> 17:48.701
YOU WERE 100% RIGHT.

17:48.735 --> 17:49.802
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS AFRAID OF.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.204
- YEAH.

17:51.238 --> 17:55.608
- OHH!
- AAH!

17:55.642 --> 17:56.709
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:56.743 --> 17:57.877
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:57.910 --> 17:59.546
- WE LIVE HERE.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.414
- WE THOUGHT YOU WERE
ON BEAR MOUNTAIN.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.250
- BEAR MOUNTAIN?
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

18:03.283 --> 18:04.784
both:
RAYMOND.

18:07.820 --> 18:10.523
- YOU WANT TO HOLSTER
THE WEAPON, BRO?

18:16.729 --> 18:18.731
- WELL?

18:18.765 --> 18:20.500
- OKAY, I LIED.
I LIED.

18:20.533 --> 18:22.902
I LIED TO EVERYBODY.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.371
I WAS TRYING TO MAKE
EVERYBODY HAPPY.

18:24.404 --> 18:26.839
- NICE JOB.

18:26.873 --> 18:29.142
- OH, I SHOULD'VE KNOWN BETTER.

18:29.176 --> 18:31.211
WHY DID--ESPECIALLY
WITH MY PARENTS,

18:31.244 --> 18:33.180
THE ONLY PEOPLE
WHO TREAT A BOX OF FRUIT

18:33.213 --> 18:36.583
LIKE IT'S PLUTONIUM.

18:36.616 --> 18:37.384
I CHICKENED OUT.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.886
I MADE A MISTAKE.
I CHICKENED OUT.

18:39.919 --> 18:40.920
ALL RIGHT,

18:40.953 --> 18:42.722
LOOK, THE TRUTH IS,

18:42.755 --> 18:44.724
DEBRA WANTED US TO HAVE
A DAY TO OURSELVES.

18:44.757 --> 18:46.793
AND ME TOO,
ME TOO.

18:46.826 --> 18:48.395
BUT DEBRA'S THE ONE.

18:48.428 --> 18:50.797
SHE'S GOT--

18:50.830 --> 18:53.500
NO, SHE'S GOT IT
VERY HARD AROUND HERE.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.402
THOUGH SHE'S NEVER
SAID THAT TO ME.

18:55.435 --> 18:57.470
I'VE NOTICED IT.

18:59.839 --> 19:01.474
LIKE DAD.

19:01.508 --> 19:04.477
I KNOW YOU TRY
TO BE FUNNY, BUT--

19:04.511 --> 19:05.778
LIKE WITH THE TWINS.

19:05.812 --> 19:08.181
MAYBE YOU
SHOULDN'T SAY,

19:08.215 --> 19:11.518
"I THINK LITTLE MATTHEW
HAS HOMOSEXUAL TENDENCIES."

19:14.487 --> 19:16.523
AND, MA, YOU CAN'T BE
SO CRITICAL.

19:16.556 --> 19:18.325
IF YOU'RE GOING
TO BE CRITICAL,

19:18.358 --> 19:20.360
COULD YOU PLEASE CALL BEFORE
YOU COME OVER HERE, REALLY,

19:20.393 --> 19:21.961
SO WE COULD
BE READY FOR IT?

19:21.994 --> 19:23.563
BOTH OF YOU,
COULD YOU BOTH CALL?

19:23.596 --> 19:24.864
WE HAVE TO PREPARE.

19:24.897 --> 19:26.866
THERE'S BILLS
AND RECEIPTS WE HIDE.

19:26.899 --> 19:29.269
AND THEN
WE CHANT A LITTLE.

19:32.305 --> 19:34.641
NOW, LISTEN, WE--
WE LOVE YOU BOTH,

19:34.674 --> 19:36.976
BUT THIS IS OUR HOUSE,
AND DEBRA'S MY WIFE,

19:37.009 --> 19:40.780
AND IF YOU CAN'T ACCEPT
WHAT I'M TELLING YOU...

19:40.813 --> 19:41.948
WELL...

19:41.981 --> 19:45.252
THEN YOU CAN'T
COME OVER HERE ANYMORE.

19:45.285 --> 19:47.654
UNLESS YOU CALL FIRST.

19:50.757 --> 19:52.892
THAT'S IT.
I THINK I DID IT ALL, RIGHT?

19:52.925 --> 19:55.495
- WHAT? THIS HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH ME.

19:58.931 --> 20:00.233
- OH, YEAH, ROBERT,

20:00.267 --> 20:02.635
COULD YOU TRY NOT TO EAT
NEAR THE KIDS?

20:10.410 --> 20:12.645
- IF YOU JUST WANTED
THE DAY TO YOURSELVES,

20:12.679 --> 20:14.281
ALL YOU HAD TO DO
WAS SAY SO.

20:14.314 --> 20:15.782
WE'D UNDERSTAND.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.684
- OF COURSE
WE'D UNDERSTAND.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.686
WHAT'S NOT
TO UNDERSTAND?

20:19.719 --> 20:21.321
WHEN DID HE GET
SO SENSITIVE?

20:21.354 --> 20:22.622
- HE'S A WRITER.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.626
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

20:36.336 --> 20:37.737
- I'M SHAKING.

20:37.770 --> 20:40.340
- OH, HONEY, YOU WERE GREAT.
YOU WERE JUST GREAT, YEAH.

20:40.373 --> 20:41.541
OH, COME HERE.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.510
COME HERE.

20:43.543 --> 20:46.012
- HEY, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
PUT ON THAT BUSTIER.

20:48.047 --> 20:51.884
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:51.918 --> 20:54.721
- OKAY, WE'LL TRY AGAIN
ON MY BIRTHDAY.
