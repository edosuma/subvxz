Stop skateboarding!

00:29.345 --> 00:32.613
Did we ever find out who sent
that truckload of flowers?

00:32.649 --> 00:33.959
Listen, Shelli, have
we figured out where...

00:33.983 --> 00:35.616
There you are. I am flying blind.

00:35.652 --> 00:38.019
Phil left no fucking
instructions for his memorial.

00:38.054 --> 00:41.722
Well, he did leave
one little instruction.

00:41.758 --> 00:45.026
He did? What is it?
Were you ever gonna tell me?

00:45.061 --> 00:47.795
No, it's fine. It's being
dealt with as we speak.

00:47.831 --> 00:49.730
How are you?

00:49.766 --> 00:51.799
How do you look this beautiful?

00:51.835 --> 00:54.302
I don't know... I can't even remember

00:54.337 --> 00:56.237
if I brushed my teeth or not.

00:56.272 --> 00:57.872
Here. I'll tell you.

01:01.077 --> 01:02.577
Um... no.

01:02.612 --> 01:05.046
I have to call Lenny Kravitz back.

01:05.081 --> 01:06.981
And Mary J. Blige.

01:07.016 --> 01:09.050
I mean, everybody
and their fucking brother

01:09.085 --> 01:10.429
- wants to perform for Phil.
- That's good.

01:10.453 --> 01:11.986
- Harvey.
- Hey.

01:12.021 --> 01:14.555
Kelly Ann almost just
cost us ten grand again

01:14.591 --> 01:16.357
by skateboarding during
the damn load-in.

01:16.392 --> 01:17.558
Eh, what else is new?

01:17.594 --> 01:19.527
So let me get this straight.

01:19.562 --> 01:22.163
Lenny Kravitz has called,
but we haven't heard

01:22.198 --> 01:23.698
- from Christopher House?
- Mm-hm.

01:23.733 --> 01:24.944
It's a cold world out there, baby.

01:24.968 --> 01:26.934
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:26.970 --> 01:29.503
Is it wrong that I'm a little
bit relieved that he's gone?

01:29.539 --> 01:31.839
- I mean Phil fucking scared me.
- Mm.

01:31.875 --> 01:33.274
He wouldn't have hurt you, Harvey.

01:33.309 --> 01:34.876
I was just scared he was gonna

01:34.911 --> 01:36.911
talk me into another one of his schemes.

01:36.946 --> 01:38.579
Phil was fucking persuasive.

01:38.615 --> 01:40.047
Bill, go to two.

01:40.083 --> 01:42.083
So, wait. Phil did leave instructions?

01:42.118 --> 01:43.551
Go for Bill.

01:43.586 --> 01:44.964
Are you gonna tell me
what those instructions are?

01:44.988 --> 01:47.221
No. That one's for Gary Clark, Jr.

01:47.257 --> 01:48.400
I feel like you're not listening
to me right now.

01:50.493 --> 01:52.226
Really?

01:56.799 --> 01:58.432
Kelly Ann.

01:58.468 --> 02:01.235
Wes. It's a memorial.

02:01.271 --> 02:03.471
You're dressed like you're
going to an Elvis party.

02:03.506 --> 02:05.606
I dressed for Phil.

02:05.642 --> 02:08.476
This is what he told me to wear.

02:08.511 --> 02:09.776
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:09.812 --> 02:12.313
He came to me in a dream and said,

02:12.348 --> 02:15.383
"Get high and dress the
fucking way you want to dress,

02:15.418 --> 02:19.120
and furthermore, I'm coming back."

02:19.155 --> 02:22.156
Son, every cloud you see

02:22.191 --> 02:24.125
and ever cord you hear...

02:24.160 --> 02:25.559
...I'll be there.

02:25.595 --> 02:27.261
It doesn't really sound like him.

02:27.297 --> 02:28.562
Oh, it was him.

02:28.598 --> 02:31.332
I know it was.

02:31.367 --> 02:33.768
It probably was.

02:33.803 --> 02:36.570
Listen. Is it true
what people are saying?

02:36.606 --> 02:38.806
Ugh. Reg and I just got drunk together.

02:38.841 --> 02:40.274
Nothing happened.

02:40.310 --> 02:43.311
Ew, dude, no. I'm talking about Phil.

02:43.346 --> 02:45.513
Is it true that he whispered
his dying words to you?

02:45.548 --> 02:47.148
Yeah.

02:47.183 --> 02:48.182
Fuck.

02:49.986 --> 02:51.652
I know.

02:51.688 --> 02:52.987
- Well?
- Well, I don't know.

02:53.022 --> 02:54.855
I'm trying to
figure out what they meant.

02:54.891 --> 02:56.424
I...

02:56.459 --> 02:57.658
I don't...

02:57.694 --> 02:59.160
There you are.

02:59.195 --> 03:00.628
Yeah.

03:03.499 --> 03:04.865
Good luck, man.

03:08.237 --> 03:10.137
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:10.173 --> 03:12.306
I thought that you'd
gone back to England.

03:12.342 --> 03:15.710
No. Phil had some...

03:15.745 --> 03:17.678
very specific last wishes,

03:17.714 --> 03:19.880
and I've just been
helping Bill carry them out.

03:19.916 --> 03:22.616
What were they?

03:22.652 --> 03:25.386
I mean, it's a bit hard to...
You're wearing a dress.

03:25.421 --> 03:27.054
True.

03:27.090 --> 03:29.323
You're the most
elegant rigger I've ever met.

03:29.359 --> 03:30.803
Well, you're the
only rigger I've ever met.

03:30.827 --> 03:32.293
Thank you.

03:32.328 --> 03:33.672
Did you really think I'd leave

03:33.696 --> 03:36.897
without saying good-bye?

03:36.933 --> 03:37.832
Have you seen Preston?

03:37.867 --> 03:39.133
- Who?
- Preston.

03:39.168 --> 03:40.512
The Staton-House manager. Preston.

03:40.536 --> 03:41.847
I don't know. What's he look like?

03:41.871 --> 03:43.371
Oh, my God. Have you never met him?

03:43.406 --> 03:45.539
- He never shows up.
- God, I love this world

03:45.575 --> 03:47.152
- that makes no sense.
- Why do you need him?

03:47.176 --> 03:48.909
Because I fucked up.

03:48.945 --> 03:50.811
I let my emotions get in the way

03:50.847 --> 03:51.846
and I fucked up royally.

03:51.881 --> 03:53.481
He got what he wanted from me

03:53.516 --> 03:54.660
and he's gonna tell
the head of Extantion.

03:54.684 --> 03:56.183
And he's gonna try not to pay,

03:56.219 --> 03:57.763
because that's how rich
people stay rich.

03:57.787 --> 04:01.489
And I never knew that I
could fuck up like this.

04:01.524 --> 04:03.758
And it feels incredible. I fucked up,

04:03.793 --> 04:05.760
and it's such a fucking relief.

04:05.795 --> 04:07.228
Though I'm sad about Phil dying.

04:07.263 --> 04:09.597
Guys, guys! Donna had a baby...

04:09.632 --> 04:12.333
Or... Laurie had Donna's baby.
Come here. Come here. Come here.

04:12.368 --> 04:13.367
- Great.
- Oh, my God.

04:13.403 --> 04:14.769
Oh, my God. Listen.

04:14.804 --> 04:16.536
I'm gonna go and find Preston,

04:16.572 --> 04:18.572
but do not disappear.

04:20.743 --> 04:23.611
Hm. Look at that face.

04:23.646 --> 04:25.746
Um, I think we have to
go a little slower.

04:25.782 --> 04:27.415
Yeah, just a little slower, please.

04:27.450 --> 04:28.394
- Yeah.
- Would be perfect.

04:28.418 --> 04:29.550
Thank you.

04:29.585 --> 04:31.952
Look. We have got to tell this crew

04:31.988 --> 04:33.687
that their band is breaking up.

04:33.723 --> 04:35.089
We have to tell them, Shelli.

04:35.124 --> 04:36.724
Oh, this fucking tour.

04:36.759 --> 04:39.293
They didn't break all the eggs.

04:39.328 --> 04:40.694
They didn't what?

04:40.730 --> 04:42.574
Listen. I do want to be clear...

04:42.598 --> 04:44.065
...about one thing...

04:44.100 --> 04:45.044
- I'm so sorry. It's Nicole Atkins.

04:45.068 --> 04:46.434
One second. Let me just...

04:46.469 --> 04:47.868
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Shelli?

04:47.904 --> 04:48.781
- One second.
- Shelli.

04:48.805 --> 04:50.137
- Hi. Just one moment.

04:50.173 --> 04:51.906
I can't talk about this right now...

04:51.941 --> 04:52.985
Excuse me. I'm looking
for the production manager.

04:53.009 --> 04:55.743
I'm the fucking production...

04:55.778 --> 04:58.279
Hey, there, lover.

04:58.314 --> 04:59.980
Sean.

05:00.016 --> 05:02.983
Wow. Sean.

05:03.019 --> 05:04.452
Wow.

05:04.487 --> 05:06.153
I can't believe you didn't call,

05:06.189 --> 05:08.089
or call and cancel.

05:08.124 --> 05:09.890
Oh, Shel. You know, it's Phil.

05:09.926 --> 05:11.270
You only get one Phil a generation.

05:11.294 --> 05:14.929
And look at you. You look amazing.

05:14.964 --> 05:16.730
Ha...

05:16.766 --> 05:19.300
Sean, meet Bill.

05:19.335 --> 05:20.734
- Bill.
- Sean.

05:20.770 --> 05:22.236
- Finally.
- Bill Hanson.

05:22.271 --> 05:25.239
I feel like I know you.

05:25.274 --> 05:27.274
Yeah. Does she talk about me?

05:27.310 --> 05:29.810
You know what? Not so much lately.

05:29.846 --> 05:31.112
Yes. I do.

05:31.147 --> 05:33.247
I feel like I know you anyway.

05:33.282 --> 05:35.316
Man... yeah. I know what you mean.

05:35.351 --> 05:37.284
- Oh, man.
- Real familiarity there.

05:37.320 --> 05:38.664
I got to hug you. I got to hug you, man.

05:38.688 --> 05:40.421
Come on. Open it up. That's it.

05:40.456 --> 05:41.655
God, I've heard so much.

05:41.691 --> 05:42.935
Yeah, I've heard a lot about you too.

05:42.959 --> 05:44.425
Where you been hiding this guy?

05:44.460 --> 05:45.938
I haven't been
hiding. I've been right here.

05:45.962 --> 05:47.162
Yeah, well... Do you work out?

05:47.196 --> 05:48.929
Where do you find the time on tour?

05:48.965 --> 05:50.642
You actually look
like you're in great shape.

05:50.666 --> 05:51.877
- Well, you know...
- You could be, like,

05:51.901 --> 05:53.112
an Ironman athlete or something.

05:53.136 --> 05:54.668
Honey?

05:57.874 --> 05:59.373
Can I get you something?

05:59.408 --> 06:01.475
Don't let my
incredible surprise ruin your day.

06:01.511 --> 06:02.977
He's always got one up his sleeve.

06:03.012 --> 06:04.656
- It is a great surprise.
- Great surprise.

06:04.680 --> 06:06.780
- Yeah.
- I love this guy.

06:06.816 --> 06:08.883
Me too.

06:08.918 --> 06:10.651
If Christopher House wants
to speak with me,

06:10.686 --> 06:12.153
he can call me himself.

06:12.188 --> 06:13.387
Hey, son.

06:13.422 --> 06:14.855
No more napkins.

06:14.891 --> 06:16.790
I'll right another song.
A sequel to "Janine."

06:16.826 --> 06:18.058
Janine II!

06:18.094 --> 06:21.028
Fuck, man. Phil's gone.

06:21.063 --> 06:22.463
Hey. Watch your language.

06:22.498 --> 06:23.697
He ain't gonna hear me.

06:23.733 --> 06:25.199
Are you kidding?

06:25.234 --> 06:27.368
Phil is everywhere.

06:27.403 --> 06:30.704
I'm not even sure if he's dead, man.

06:30.740 --> 06:32.373
Here you go.

06:32.408 --> 06:34.909
You're gonna leave me
for another band, aren't you?

06:34.944 --> 06:36.744
No. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

06:36.779 --> 06:40.181
I'll find you, okay? We'll shoot hoops

06:40.216 --> 06:41.682
and talk about the old days

06:41.717 --> 06:43.584
like you ruining Woody Guthrie's guitar.

06:43.619 --> 06:47.221
And Mellencamp blew 50
cigarettes worth of smoke

06:47.256 --> 06:48.455
in your child face.

06:50.259 --> 06:51.203
Good times

06:51.227 --> 06:52.726
Good times.

06:52.762 --> 06:53.839
Hey, you could teach me
how to use your knife.

06:53.863 --> 06:54.862
You know what I mean?

06:56.732 --> 06:58.332
Excuse me.

06:58.367 --> 07:00.067
Are you Wesley Mason?

07:02.104 --> 07:05.239
Why, yes, I totally am.

07:07.977 --> 07:10.544
You're being sued by
the city of Escondido

07:10.580 --> 07:12.713
for the proliferation
of invasion plants,

07:12.748 --> 07:14.114
particularly the Lotus Delphi,

07:14.150 --> 07:15.849
which, in your absence from home,

07:15.885 --> 07:17.251
has taken over a mile-wide portion

07:17.286 --> 07:18.686
of a public greenbelt.

07:18.721 --> 07:20.365
By taking these papers,
you acknowledge receipt

07:20.389 --> 07:22.189
of this subpoena.

07:22.225 --> 07:23.891
Sorry for your loss.

07:29.498 --> 07:31.232
Fuck!

07:31.267 --> 07:34.301
Looks like she needed time
to herself. What do you think?

07:34.337 --> 07:36.281
At this point, you probably
know her better than I do.

07:36.305 --> 07:39.039
- I wouldn't say that.
- No. I'm joking.

07:39.075 --> 07:42.109
Say, Wes, would you mind,
if you have the time,

07:42.144 --> 07:44.545
grab us a couple coffees, please?

07:44.580 --> 07:46.480
Coffee?

07:46.515 --> 07:48.082
Yeah. Coffee. You know, that beverage

07:48.117 --> 07:49.717
that you make better than anybody else?

07:49.752 --> 07:51.930
Wes makes these incredible
espressos called "Wes-pressos."

07:51.954 --> 07:53.821
- None for me. Thanks.
- You know what?

07:53.856 --> 07:56.068
That's a good point. I've been
drinking too much coffee myself.

07:56.092 --> 07:58.726
Wes, you can cancel the coffees. Thanks.

07:58.761 --> 08:02.096
Ugh. So, do you want it or not, Bill?

08:02.131 --> 08:04.064
No, thank you.

08:04.100 --> 08:07.334
Jesus. Make up your mind, man.

08:07.370 --> 08:09.136
He's a great kid.

08:09.171 --> 08:11.805
He's been taking Phil's
loss pretty hard.

08:11.841 --> 08:14.275
Fucking shit! Seriously, man.

08:14.310 --> 08:15.309
Damn it!

08:16.545 --> 08:19.813
Hey. You know, believe it or not,

08:19.849 --> 08:21.749
coffee makes them jumpy.

08:21.784 --> 08:24.151
Sorry... who jumpy?

08:24.186 --> 08:25.319
Sperm.

08:25.354 --> 08:26.954
- Oh.
- Yeah.

08:26.989 --> 08:28.622
I mean, which may sound
counterintuitive,

08:28.658 --> 08:30.524
'cause you want them to be jumpy, right?

08:30.559 --> 08:32.293
But no, not too jumpy.

08:32.328 --> 08:33.927
Too jumpy's not good.

08:33.962 --> 08:35.429
I didn't know that.

08:35.464 --> 08:37.965
I have this incredible app.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.969
You can actually figure out
when a woman is ovulating.

08:42.004 --> 08:43.871
That is incredible.

08:43.905 --> 08:46.040
I'm sorry. I don't mean to overshare.

08:46.075 --> 08:47.374
No. Not at all.

08:47.410 --> 08:48.887
But, you know, with my father dying...

08:48.911 --> 08:51.312
Yeah, I'm real sorry about
that. That's sad.

08:51.347 --> 08:53.681
Oh, thank you. No, and now Phil?

08:53.716 --> 08:55.983
You know, I've been looking
at everything differently.

08:56.018 --> 08:57.718
- Yeah.
- And I'm finally secure

08:57.753 --> 08:59.286
financially.

08:59.322 --> 09:00.962
And we've always talked
about having kids.

09:00.990 --> 09:02.022
Like, always.

09:04.026 --> 09:06.193
- You did?
- Yeah.

09:06.228 --> 09:09.063
Yeah. But it never seemed
to be the right time.

09:09.098 --> 09:12.833
You know, but now,
you know, I realize...

09:12.868 --> 09:14.234
Why wait?

09:14.270 --> 09:16.036
That... exactly? Why...

09:16.072 --> 09:18.172
Why hold back?

09:18.207 --> 09:19.406
That's it.

09:19.442 --> 09:22.042
You understand.

09:22.078 --> 09:23.744
Yeah. I do.

09:31.721 --> 09:33.253
I'm gonna boink her.

10:45.828 --> 10:49.997
We're here today to celebrate Phil.

10:50.032 --> 10:54.268
Phil did not like encores.

10:55.504 --> 10:57.671
So he loved the way The Who did it.

10:57.706 --> 11:00.974
You know, if you were able
to demolish all your equipment,

11:01.010 --> 11:03.143
trash the stage,

11:03.179 --> 11:06.847
it left absolutely no question

11:06.882 --> 11:09.116
as to if the show was over.

11:09.151 --> 11:12.286
It was done. They left it on the stage.

11:12.321 --> 11:15.255
And so I think of this
because even if Phil could,

11:15.291 --> 11:19.293
in some crazy metaphysical
fifth-dimension way,

11:19.328 --> 11:23.363
somehow find a way to come return to us

11:23.399 --> 11:25.933
and give us an encore,

11:25.968 --> 11:27.468
he wouldn't do it.

11:30.473 --> 11:32.706
But it would be such a surprise.

11:34.143 --> 11:36.810
Right, Ella? It would be a surprise.

11:38.380 --> 11:39.980
And I just want Phil to know

11:40.015 --> 11:44.151
that... that we haven't left our seats.

11:44.186 --> 11:46.787
No one's left the building.

11:46.822 --> 11:50.023
Come on, Phil. One more song.

12:13.415 --> 12:17.684
♪ Tidal waves

12:17.720 --> 12:21.822

You look good. I remember this look.

14:06.028 --> 14:09.463
Now, I know everyone says I'm mean,

14:09.498 --> 14:11.765
but Phillip understood the truth:

14:11.800 --> 14:14.301
I don't like to waste time.

14:14.336 --> 14:16.703
I'd like to get this over with
as quickly as possible.

14:16.739 --> 14:19.506
Now, if you're here,

14:19.541 --> 14:23.610
he probably didn't dislike you.

14:23.646 --> 14:26.546
Although I can tell you right
now he never liked you.

14:28.083 --> 14:31.118
And I'm mad at every single one of you.

14:31.153 --> 14:33.220
You should've sent him
home from the road.

14:33.255 --> 14:35.222
You should have told him what I said,

14:35.257 --> 14:37.858
- "Exercise. Eat healthier."
- Yeah!

14:37.893 --> 14:41.061
I know you think you
loved him, but I loved him more.

14:41.096 --> 14:43.230
So shame on you. Shame on you!

14:43.265 --> 14:46.533
Wow, she's really mean.

14:46.568 --> 14:49.503
Yeah. But you can tell
she really loved him.

14:49.538 --> 14:51.505
Shame on you! Shame on all of you.

14:51.540 --> 14:53.306
To tell the truth,

14:53.342 --> 14:55.175
I kind of found Phil insufferable.

14:55.210 --> 14:57.010
I know.

14:57.046 --> 14:58.712
He was an acquired taste.

14:58.747 --> 15:01.882
I mean, he cheated, stole,
and killed two people.

15:01.917 --> 15:03.150
But he never lied.

15:03.185 --> 15:05.218
You got to give him that.

15:05.254 --> 15:07.354
Let's keep the Phil
imitations to a minimum,

15:07.389 --> 15:08.555
shall we?

15:08.590 --> 15:10.524
So you're here for Phil, hm?

15:10.559 --> 15:12.392
Actually,

15:12.428 --> 15:14.895
we need to go somewhere and talk.

15:14.930 --> 15:16.763
Alone.

15:16.799 --> 15:21.601
So, honey, with everyone dying,

15:21.637 --> 15:24.237
there's something I haven't
had a chance to tell you,

15:24.273 --> 15:27.374
which is actually kind of a big deal.

15:29.411 --> 15:31.078
What's going on?

15:31.113 --> 15:33.547
Wow. I'm actually nervous.

15:33.582 --> 15:35.115
What are you doing?

15:35.150 --> 15:37.617
You didn't even get on
your knees when you proposed.

15:37.653 --> 15:41.588
I give you the Maldives.

15:41.623 --> 15:44.357
What?

15:44.393 --> 15:45.692
Wow.

15:45.728 --> 15:48.428
Phase one, massages, coconut water,

15:48.464 --> 15:50.263
and round-the-clock beach sex

15:50.299 --> 15:52.466
till I knock you up.

15:52.501 --> 15:54.634
Phase two, I spoil you silly

15:54.670 --> 15:56.737
while you get fat and happy

15:56.772 --> 16:00.440
with tits out to here
and a little alien inside.

16:00.476 --> 16:04.478
And phase three, we get what
we've been working for forever.

16:04.513 --> 16:06.513
A real family.

16:08.650 --> 16:10.117
Life is fleeting.

16:10.152 --> 16:11.985
The time is now.

16:16.825 --> 16:18.725
So...

16:18.761 --> 16:20.861
what was it you haven't
had a chance to tell me?

16:25.768 --> 16:28.401
Tom asked me to manage the band.

16:28.437 --> 16:30.804
- Amazing.
- Yeah. Right?

16:30.839 --> 16:32.283
Yeah. Of course, there is no more band.

16:32.307 --> 16:33.673
How'd you know that?

16:33.709 --> 16:35.275
Oh, the whole industry knows.

16:35.310 --> 16:39.913
But the fact that they
approached you is awesome.

16:39.948 --> 16:42.816
God, you make me so proud.

16:44.653 --> 16:47.320
You want to get a head start?

16:47.356 --> 16:49.322
During Phil's memorial?

16:49.358 --> 16:51.758
I think that would be
highly inappropriate.

16:51.794 --> 16:54.427
Honey, they'll be at this forever.

16:54.463 --> 16:55.540
Come on. We can have sex a couple times.

16:55.564 --> 16:56.474
They'll still be at it.

16:56.498 --> 16:57.764
You are not wrong.

16:57.800 --> 16:59.266
But I have to get to the stage.

16:59.301 --> 17:01.034
Will you please
guard these with your life?

17:02.671 --> 17:03.637
I got to go.

17:03.672 --> 17:04.503
To be continued.

17:04.540 --> 17:05.672
Uh-huh.

17:05.707 --> 17:07.874
Just hurry back.

17:07.910 --> 17:09.643
You really surprised me.

17:09.678 --> 17:14.214
Here's a song I wrote
for our man in the hat.

17:16.852 --> 17:20.987
Our breath is like the sea

17:21.022 --> 17:24.657
going in and out on a beach.

17:24.693 --> 17:28.194
And when it stops, that's high tide.

17:28.230 --> 17:31.965
This is for you, Mr. Valentine,

17:32.000 --> 17:36.002
whom I will never, ever forget.

17:55.390 --> 17:58.325

18:27.556 --> 18:28.755
Me too.

18:28.790 --> 18:31.858
You look amazing.

18:31.894 --> 18:33.226
Why are you here?

18:33.262 --> 18:35.862
I heard you had a baby.

18:35.898 --> 18:38.465
Four weeks before the fucking due date.

18:38.500 --> 18:39.733
But they're both fine?

18:39.768 --> 18:42.035
Um... yeah.

18:42.070 --> 18:43.703
I've been praying my ass off.

18:43.739 --> 18:45.205
He's so little.

18:45.240 --> 18:47.908
They put him in this thing
called an isolette.

18:47.943 --> 18:49.442
He's still in there right now.

18:49.478 --> 18:51.711
Wait. Your baby's still in the hospital?

18:51.747 --> 18:53.980
And... Donna, sweetheart,

18:54.016 --> 18:55.548
why are you here?

18:55.584 --> 18:56.816
What do you mean?

18:56.852 --> 18:57.929
I mean, I need to
pay my respects to Phil.

18:57.953 --> 18:59.252
Okay, listen.

18:59.288 --> 19:00.987
You need to go back to Laurie and...

19:01.023 --> 19:02.155
What's your baby's name?

19:02.190 --> 19:03.189
Buzz.

19:05.694 --> 19:07.093
We wanted it to be a sound.

19:07.129 --> 19:08.128
Mm-hmm.

19:08.163 --> 19:09.763
Go be with them.

19:09.798 --> 19:13.433
Really? I mean, there's lots of nurses

19:13.468 --> 19:14.801
and Laurie's aunt,

19:14.836 --> 19:16.114
and it just kind of
felt like they didn't

19:16.138 --> 19:17.437
really need me there right now.

19:17.472 --> 19:19.005
They do. Trust me.

19:19.041 --> 19:20.573
Just go back.

19:20.609 --> 19:23.276
Go home and hold little Buzz.

19:23.312 --> 19:25.779
And if you need anything,
you let us know.

19:25.814 --> 19:28.348
I think I'm kind of, like,
in shock or something.

19:28.383 --> 19:29.749
You are.

19:29.785 --> 19:31.952
- What's wrong with me?
- You're fine.

19:31.987 --> 19:35.355
You just had a fucking baby.

19:35.390 --> 19:37.190
I just had a fucking baby.

19:37.225 --> 19:38.692
Mm-hmm.

19:38.727 --> 19:41.461
- I love you.
- I love you too.

19:41.496 --> 19:42.696
Are you okay?

19:42.731 --> 19:44.698
Uh... no.

19:44.733 --> 19:46.132
But we'll talk about that later.

19:46.168 --> 19:48.001
I'm gonna leave
right after the tour photo.

19:48.036 --> 19:49.002
Okay.

19:49.037 --> 19:50.036
Right after.

20:09.591 --> 20:12.525
Kelly Ann!

20:12.561 --> 20:13.860
Um...

20:13.895 --> 20:15.139
you go ahead and I'll be right there.

20:15.163 --> 20:16.830
- All right.
- Okay.

20:19.234 --> 20:21.368
How are you? Are you okay?

20:21.403 --> 20:22.547
I've been thinking about you.

20:22.571 --> 20:23.837
Yeah, I'm all right, Natalie.

20:23.872 --> 20:25.638
What did Phil whisper to you?

20:25.674 --> 20:27.741
Because from where I was standing,

20:27.776 --> 20:30.477
it kind of sounded like "fellatio."

20:30.512 --> 20:33.013
I'd rather not say.

20:33.048 --> 20:35.015
And no.

20:35.050 --> 20:37.183
All right.

20:37.219 --> 20:39.486
Listen, there's something
I want to ask you.

20:39.521 --> 20:40.687
Please be honest.

20:40.722 --> 20:42.322
Did I find it insensitive

20:42.357 --> 20:43.890
that you and Rick got married

20:43.925 --> 20:46.993
the day after Phil died?

20:47.029 --> 20:48.161
Yeah.

20:48.196 --> 20:50.563
Well, it was a civil ceremony,

20:50.599 --> 20:51.909
and the party won't be for months,

20:51.933 --> 20:53.767
and not my question.

20:53.802 --> 20:57.904
Will I ever really trust you?

20:57.939 --> 20:58.938
No.

20:58.974 --> 21:00.073
Totally understandable,

21:00.108 --> 21:01.608
and you probably shouldn't.

21:01.643 --> 21:03.510
And also not my question.

21:03.545 --> 21:05.078
What's your fucking question, Natalie?

21:05.113 --> 21:06.613
Are people blaming me

21:06.648 --> 21:08.114
for the band breaking up?

21:08.150 --> 21:11.317
Because that shit? It's on Janine.

21:13.121 --> 21:15.388
The band is breaking up?

21:28.070 --> 21:32.505
Phillip Cornelius Valentine.

21:33.809 --> 21:35.708
I'd like to sing a valentine

21:35.744 --> 21:37.911
to Mr. Valentine.

21:44.920 --> 21:49.289
♪ He was a friend of mine ♪

21:52.194 --> 21:56.129

Hey, this is my hiding spot. Sorry.

22:31.867 --> 22:33.366
Me too.

22:33.401 --> 22:36.035
Jeanie Buss brought me
up here the first time.

22:36.071 --> 22:38.138
Is that right? It
took them a couple years

22:38.173 --> 22:40.173
before they showed it to me.

22:42.377 --> 22:44.310
You know, Bill, this was supposed to be

22:44.346 --> 22:46.613
a simple winter tour.

22:46.648 --> 22:48.481
Yeah. Yeah.

22:48.517 --> 22:50.717
Got a lot going on down there.

22:50.752 --> 22:53.119
I sure do.

22:53.155 --> 22:56.322
Got Sean hugging me,

22:56.358 --> 23:00.660
telling me about how you two are
gonna be starting a family.

23:00.695 --> 23:02.562
He told you about that too?

23:02.597 --> 23:03.963
He did.

23:03.999 --> 23:06.399
He's got one hell of a grip, too.

23:06.434 --> 23:10.136
He had a real Bill Clinton clasp
on my elbow and my shoulder.

23:10.172 --> 23:12.372
Yeah.

23:12.407 --> 23:16.709
Now, are you up here hiding
from me or from Sean?

23:19.581 --> 23:24.384
Desperate times require
desperate measures.

23:24.419 --> 23:25.752
All right.

23:29.357 --> 23:31.691
Hey, Shelli.

23:31.726 --> 23:33.326
Shelli, you know Shelli Azoff.

23:33.361 --> 23:34.928
Yes.

23:34.963 --> 23:37.697
Don Henley always says,
"This, the fabulous Forum,

23:37.732 --> 23:39.599
is the house that Shelli built."

23:39.634 --> 23:41.434
- Nice to meet you, Shelli.
- Shelli, Shelli.

23:41.469 --> 23:42.702
An honor.

23:42.737 --> 23:45.505
I just came up here for a smoke.

23:45.540 --> 23:47.740
Oh, Jackson Browne is
looking for you, Bill.

23:47.776 --> 23:49.042
Okay. Great.

23:49.077 --> 23:50.176
You look beautiful.

23:50.212 --> 23:52.378

You know Greg Leisz, right?

25:31.546 --> 25:33.846
Of course I know Greg.
Thank you very much for coming.

25:33.882 --> 25:35.660
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you. Thank you.

25:43.992 --> 25:46.626
All right.

25:46.661 --> 25:48.194
You know, he used to drive Warren.

25:48.229 --> 25:49.962
You drove Warren Zevon?

25:49.998 --> 25:53.299
Yeah, I used to drive the
Windcutter when I was a kid.

25:53.335 --> 25:54.979
Oh, that was a great tour.
I heard that was a great one.

25:55.003 --> 25:56.636
Yeah. Spirited times.

25:56.671 --> 25:58.404
Was that the name of the Winnebago?

25:58.440 --> 26:00.573
Yeah, we called the Winnebago
the Windcutter.

26:02.243 --> 26:04.677
Had a top speed of 68.

26:04.713 --> 26:08.247
At 69 miles an hour,
it would catch on fire.

26:08.283 --> 26:11.017
Yeah, those were good times with Warren.

26:11.052 --> 26:13.319
He was a real good guy.
And Jackson was always

26:13.355 --> 26:16.723
very kind to me out there when
we'd run across each other.

26:16.758 --> 26:18.358
How you doing?

26:18.393 --> 26:23.062
It's going pretty good.
Phil left me his gun.

26:23.098 --> 26:24.530
- The pistol?
- Yeah.

26:27.268 --> 26:29.068
It was given to me today.

26:29.104 --> 26:30.848
It's right there in the case,
if you want to see it.

26:30.872 --> 26:32.505
May I?

26:32.540 --> 26:33.539
Please.

26:38.446 --> 26:40.113
In here?

26:40.148 --> 26:41.247
God damn it.

26:42.450 --> 26:43.516
I don't think it's loaded.

26:43.551 --> 26:45.218
Yeah, it's not loaded.

26:45.253 --> 26:48.454
It's a reference to this event
that took place in Barstow

26:48.490 --> 26:50.423
where he sort of intervened
on my behalf.

26:50.458 --> 26:52.558
He thought I was
egregiously under-armed

26:52.594 --> 26:54.761
for the situation I found myself in,

26:54.796 --> 26:56.629
and he sort of intervened.

26:56.664 --> 26:58.197
Uh-huh.

26:58.233 --> 27:00.967
It was okay. No one
got shot or anything.

27:01.002 --> 27:03.369
But it might be a reminder

27:03.405 --> 27:05.772
to finish the song we started
to write about it

27:05.807 --> 27:07.907
called "Seven Things to Do in Barstow."

27:07.942 --> 27:11.544
It's kind of like
Phil's version of closure.

27:11.579 --> 27:13.913
But I'll let you guys get back to it.

27:13.948 --> 27:15.982
Again, thank you very much for coming.

27:16.017 --> 27:17.784
- Thanks, Bill.
- You guys sound great.

27:17.819 --> 27:18.929
Let me know if you need anything,

27:18.953 --> 27:20.820
and I can stop back by, so...

27:20.855 --> 27:23.267
And I'll go ahead and tell them
you don't need security anymore.

27:23.291 --> 27:24.235
Okay? You got it all covered.

29:04.359 --> 29:05.558
Unbelievable.

29:05.593 --> 29:07.760
So, yeah, I've been looking for you.

29:07.795 --> 29:09.929
I put you down to speak.

29:09.964 --> 29:11.564
Nope.

29:11.599 --> 29:12.999
- Yes.
- No.

29:13.034 --> 29:15.001
Yeah. I'm gonna
have you go on before me,

29:15.036 --> 29:16.247
and what I'd like for you to do

29:16.271 --> 29:18.671
is just share what Phil said to you

29:18.706 --> 29:19.772
in that fateful moment.

29:19.807 --> 29:22.508
You know? His last words.

29:22.544 --> 29:24.877
- Word.
- Cool. Let's do it.

29:24.913 --> 29:26.223
No. I don't mean "word" meaning "okay."

29:26.247 --> 29:27.713
I mean "word" meaning "word."

29:27.749 --> 29:30.349
There were no last words. Just one word.

29:30.385 --> 29:31.450
Four syllables.

29:31.486 --> 29:33.252
Okay, well, this is not charades.

29:33.288 --> 29:35.788
So, whatever the
word was, just share it.

29:35.823 --> 29:37.390
I can't really make any sense of it.

29:37.425 --> 29:40.126
I don't think I should share it.

29:40.161 --> 29:42.395
I mean, was it dirty?

29:42.430 --> 29:44.130
- No.
- Okay, good,

29:44.165 --> 29:45.442
'cause we have youngsters here tonight.

29:45.466 --> 29:48.467
So, can I count on you?

29:50.805 --> 29:52.104
Mm-hmm.

29:53.474 --> 29:54.740
Well, let me give you a hand.

29:54.776 --> 29:56.809
No. I got it.

29:56.844 --> 29:58.311
You look good, Kelly Ann.

29:58.346 --> 30:02.048
I can't believe that Phil's last gig

30:02.083 --> 30:03.583
was a corporate gig.

30:03.618 --> 30:06.586
It wasn't. Phil's last gig was Seattle.

30:06.621 --> 30:07.720
Okay?

30:07.755 --> 30:09.455
Corporate gig doesn't count.

30:09.490 --> 30:10.856
Good.

30:12.527 --> 30:14.093
Bill?

30:17.098 --> 30:20.199
I know about the band breaking up.

30:21.803 --> 30:24.637
And I just can't believe it.

30:24.672 --> 30:26.606
It's so sad.

30:26.641 --> 30:28.608
Yeah, it is sad.

30:30.478 --> 30:34.513
I don't want to go up there.
I'll get stage fright.

30:35.850 --> 30:38.150
Do it for Phil.

30:38.186 --> 30:40.987
He never could
figure out whether I was...

30:41.022 --> 30:44.123
Shelly Ann or Kelly Ann.

30:44.158 --> 30:45.958
Kelly Ann.

30:45.994 --> 30:47.126
Right.

30:47.161 --> 30:50.496
He always really seemed to like you.

30:50.531 --> 30:51.797
Do a good job.

30:53.901 --> 30:55.512
I'm probably the only
person in this room

30:55.536 --> 30:57.470
who never called that guy Phil.

30:57.505 --> 30:59.705
But I'm proud to say
that I called him Dad.

31:02.377 --> 31:04.143
I didn't see him much
when I was growing up.

31:04.178 --> 31:08.848
I remember he came to visit me
when I graduated Vanderbilt

31:08.883 --> 31:11.951
and he brought The Doobie
Brothers with him.

31:11.986 --> 31:14.020
I was like, "Hey, Dad, I graduated."

31:14.055 --> 31:16.789
And there's The Doobie Brothers.

31:16.824 --> 31:18.624
So, the day that I graduated,

31:18.660 --> 31:20.393
I got their autograph on my diploma.

31:23.598 --> 31:24.563
There's, uh...

31:27.101 --> 31:29.035
...so many things...

31:35.843 --> 31:40.579
There's so many things
that I wanted to say to him,

31:40.615 --> 31:42.915
and I never got the chance.

31:45.920 --> 31:47.153
But I realized

31:47.188 --> 31:50.756
that even though he's not here...

31:52.894 --> 31:55.494
...doesn't mean that he's not listening.

31:55.530 --> 31:57.229
This is for you, Phil,

31:57.265 --> 32:00.700
and for Vernon and Ella,

32:00.735 --> 32:03.035
and all of our road warriors.

The other night, I found

34:00.421 --> 34:04.390
one of the most influential men
in my life in front of me.

34:04.425 --> 34:06.458
And he wasn't doing too well.

34:06.494 --> 34:09.895
In fact, he was leaving this Earth.

34:11.933 --> 34:13.966
But he had a smile on his face.

34:14.001 --> 34:17.136
And he beckoned me to lean forward.

34:17.170 --> 34:18.504
And what he whispered in my ear,

34:18.539 --> 34:20.873
I have shared with nobody.

34:20.908 --> 34:25.077
But Bill Hanson convinced me
to share it with all of you.

34:25.112 --> 34:28.047
And I will now tell you what he said.

34:30.952 --> 34:32.083
He said...

34:36.556 --> 34:38.389
..."pistachio."

34:41.395 --> 34:43.596
I'm not sure whether he meant

34:43.630 --> 34:46.764
the flavor or the nut itself,

34:46.801 --> 34:49.268
but he said it with such caring

34:49.303 --> 34:50.936
that I really...

34:50.972 --> 34:54.373
I knew that it was something important.

34:54.408 --> 34:56.275
You know, one of the strange things

34:56.310 --> 34:58.544
about being here tonight...

34:58.579 --> 35:02.414
It's so great to see so many
people I know from the past.

35:02.450 --> 35:05.551
It's... it's... in spite
of the circumstances,

35:05.586 --> 35:09.255
it's a... it's... It's a joyous thing.

35:09.290 --> 35:12.558
But that was the thing
about Phil, was...

35:12.593 --> 35:14.037
...he made friends everywhere he went.

35:14.061 --> 35:17.763
He was... he was bringing
the people together.

35:17.798 --> 35:20.966
He was bringing people together
all the time, and...

35:23.271 --> 35:24.737
He brought us together.

35:24.772 --> 35:27.473
I just met Jess
and Holly tonight, and...

35:28.509 --> 35:29.775
we get to sing this song.

35:29.810 --> 35:31.010
This was...

35:32.647 --> 35:34.914
This is a song that
Phil told me many times was

37:18.352 --> 37:21.587
Well, how do you eulogize a guy

37:21.622 --> 37:23.389
who, in his younger days,

37:23.424 --> 37:26.325
considered anything less than
a threesome a waste of time.

37:29.363 --> 37:31.830
Just kidding, Ella. That's a Phil joke,

37:31.866 --> 37:33.699
said about other people.

37:36.037 --> 37:38.871
A lot of you here with us are
from the Staton-House Band,

37:38.906 --> 37:43.342
and I'd like to say
that I saw Phil at his peak

37:43.377 --> 37:44.610
with my band,

37:44.645 --> 37:47.846
and his last lap around was a doozy.

37:47.882 --> 37:50.549
We had a long bus ride the other night,

37:50.584 --> 37:52.451
and instead of sleeping,

37:52.486 --> 37:56.088
he told us a story
about how we choose our bands,

37:56.123 --> 38:00.125
the bands we love, and the
bands we love to tour with.

38:00.161 --> 38:03.562
And he told a pretty epic tale

38:03.597 --> 38:06.632
about his meeting Lynyrd Skynyrd,

38:06.667 --> 38:09.401
and his father's bait shack,

38:09.437 --> 38:11.070
and his proposal to Ella,

38:11.105 --> 38:13.238
and the birth of Vernon.

38:13.274 --> 38:15.574
One thing I've realized about Phil is

38:15.609 --> 38:18.277
that he wanted to save people

38:18.312 --> 38:21.547
the way music had saved him.

38:21.582 --> 38:25.150
And I think he'd begun to wonder
in the last few years,

38:25.186 --> 38:26.785
with the way things are going,

38:26.821 --> 38:28.821
was there a place in
the world for someone

38:28.856 --> 38:31.090
who did what he did?

38:31.125 --> 38:32.558
He saved people.

38:32.593 --> 38:35.828
And he always made a
point to give a leg-up

38:35.863 --> 38:38.163
or a purpose or a piece of advice

38:38.199 --> 38:42.501
to everyone that he met and trusted.

38:42.536 --> 38:45.938
And in life, that's a
person to be treasured.

38:45.973 --> 38:47.840
And in our business,

38:47.875 --> 38:49.741
that's a roadie.

38:49.777 --> 38:52.845
He was old-school
and new-school.

38:52.880 --> 38:54.346
He was all-school.

38:54.381 --> 38:58.984
And he will never be gone.

38:59.019 --> 39:00.853
The road is a dangerous place,

39:00.888 --> 39:02.488
and it's a hell of a way to lead a life.

39:02.523 --> 39:04.456
There's a body count, to be sure.

39:04.492 --> 39:06.191
There's a lot of loss,

39:06.227 --> 39:10.362
and a lot of men and women
don't make it all the way.

39:10.397 --> 39:13.332
But I'd like to just add one Phil-ism

39:13.367 --> 39:16.034
that he told me on more
than one occasion,

39:16.070 --> 39:17.436
and that's that,

39:17.471 --> 39:21.473
"Even your suckiest day out on tour

39:21.509 --> 39:23.709
will be a story that you'll tell later."

39:23.744 --> 39:25.043
And he was right.

39:25.079 --> 39:27.646
And I think he realized, as I do now,

39:27.681 --> 39:31.717
that this job
leaves a mark on your life.

39:31.752 --> 39:35.320
I spent a lot of time
with Phil shoulder to shoulder,

39:35.356 --> 39:37.389
and I learned a lot from him.

39:37.424 --> 39:39.057
I think that collaboration means

39:39.093 --> 39:42.027
that when you dig deep,

39:42.062 --> 39:43.362
where it's dark,

39:43.397 --> 39:45.964
you need someone there that you trust

39:46.000 --> 39:47.499
to hold the lantern.

39:47.535 --> 39:49.535
And the next time, when they dig deep,

39:49.570 --> 39:52.171
you're there with the lantern.

39:52.206 --> 39:54.072
And Phil always had my lantern.

39:56.510 --> 40:00.512
And, you know, now that he's gone...

40:02.516 --> 40:05.684
...I wonder where
that light will come from.

40:05.719 --> 40:09.354
Where are those people that,
with their last breath,

40:09.390 --> 40:12.057
they'll look you right in
the eyes and not say "help"

40:12.092 --> 40:14.326
or "save me."

40:14.361 --> 40:16.995
We're here to celebrate
the person who says,

40:17.031 --> 40:19.398
for some reason,

40:19.433 --> 40:24.269
with love and mystery,

40:24.305 --> 40:26.104
"pistachio."

40:28.409 --> 40:30.642
Yeah. Pistachio.

40:33.147 --> 40:36.014
Change happens.

40:36.050 --> 40:38.584
You get your heart broke.

40:38.619 --> 40:40.118
You hurt.

40:41.388 --> 40:43.922
Friends die.

40:43.958 --> 40:46.258
You point fingers.

40:46.293 --> 40:48.227
You fight.

40:48.262 --> 40:51.096
You sleep with the wrong person.

40:51.131 --> 40:53.265
You love each other.

40:53.300 --> 40:56.068
You hate each other.

40:57.271 --> 41:00.205
And you write about it.

41:00.241 --> 41:02.374
And you sing about it.

41:02.409 --> 41:04.643
And it touches people.

Is it Phil?

43:59.486 --> 44:01.586
No.

44:01.622 --> 44:05.624
You know, if you'd
asked me even a year ago...

44:07.327 --> 44:08.627
...it would've meant everything.

44:10.664 --> 44:13.465
But not now. I can't go away with you

44:13.500 --> 44:18.270
or have your baby or be married anymore.

44:18.305 --> 44:21.773
Life is fleeting.

44:21.809 --> 44:24.276
You're right.

44:24.311 --> 44:27.446
And I'm so sorry.

44:30.784 --> 44:32.717
I'm not the last person you kissed.

44:42.362 --> 44:44.729
Well, fuck you, Shelli.

44:52.906 --> 44:55.474
And I'll be taking Jenny Passorelli

44:55.509 --> 44:56.908
to the Maldives.

45:05.419 --> 45:07.419
He should.

45:16.997 --> 45:18.630
Hey, Preston!

45:18.665 --> 45:19.564
You made it!

45:19.600 --> 45:20.599
Where's Reg?

45:22.569 --> 45:24.202
I helped too.

45:25.873 --> 45:27.973
They know.

45:28.008 --> 45:30.342
About the band breaking up?

45:30.377 --> 45:32.589
Shit. I thought we were gonna
tell them after the memorial.

45:32.613 --> 45:33.912
I told them.

45:33.947 --> 45:36.114
- You wh...
- Oh, you wanted this one?

45:38.185 --> 45:39.651
I'm gonna miss you.

45:39.686 --> 45:41.052
Come here.

45:44.958 --> 45:47.325
I just always thought that you hated me.

45:47.361 --> 45:49.628
I just suck at compliments.

45:51.965 --> 45:54.866
Oh, my God. Look.

45:58.772 --> 46:00.472
- Whoa.
- Whoa is right.

46:02.242 --> 46:04.075
There's a prom couple for you.

46:17.991 --> 46:19.457
Where's Sean?

46:19.493 --> 46:21.126
Bill? Bill? Can I have a quick word?

46:21.161 --> 46:23.194
Thanks.

46:23.230 --> 46:26.464
Well, it's all arranged.

46:26.500 --> 46:28.066
What... what's all arranged?

46:28.101 --> 46:31.069
Well, Reg has been instrumental
in helping to carry out

46:31.104 --> 46:32.270
Phil's final wish.

46:32.306 --> 46:33.772
What is Phil's final wish?

46:33.807 --> 46:35.451
- Unique. Unique.
- So, Reg, thank you very much.

46:35.475 --> 46:36.608
I really appreciate it.

46:36.643 --> 46:38.476
Well, thank you for appreciating it.

46:38.512 --> 46:41.646
Wow, this is amazing.

46:41.682 --> 46:42.981
Reg, do you like pie?

46:43.016 --> 46:44.983
No. But that's very kind of you to ask.

46:45.018 --> 46:45.995
I'm more of a cake person.

46:46.019 --> 46:47.953
I like cakes. Yeah.

46:47.988 --> 46:50.255
Well...

46:50.290 --> 46:51.556
We got you a pie.

46:54.328 --> 46:57.295
Yeah!

47:01.501 --> 47:02.334
You look good.

47:10.210 --> 47:12.243
Hi.

47:26.727 --> 47:29.661
You want to try it?

47:33.233 --> 47:35.533
I have something for you.

47:46.847 --> 47:48.847
- You.
- Yeah. Me.

47:48.882 --> 47:49.948
I've been looking for you.

47:49.983 --> 47:51.449
You've really got some balls.

47:51.485 --> 47:54.319
Look. Before you say
another word, I know.

47:54.354 --> 47:55.865
I know your actual reason
for bringing me here.

47:55.889 --> 47:57.455
I was your patsy.

47:57.491 --> 48:00.025
Well, yeah, but that was before
I knew how good you are.

48:00.060 --> 48:02.327
You are a fucking street fighter.

48:02.362 --> 48:04.629
You are a fucking genius.

48:04.665 --> 48:05.830
Am I?

48:05.866 --> 48:07.532
The Janine move. That was brilliant.

48:07.567 --> 48:09.634
Using her to break up the band.

48:09.670 --> 48:11.503
- What?
- Even I was impressed.

48:11.538 --> 48:12.837
That was some world-class shit.

48:12.873 --> 48:14.239
Can I smoke in here?

48:14.274 --> 48:15.551
I don't know how much they're paying you

48:15.575 --> 48:17.142
in your company,

48:17.177 --> 48:19.077
but you're worth
twice as much, at least.

48:20.681 --> 48:23.815
Preston, I know you brought me here

48:23.850 --> 48:26.551
to prove to Tom that this tour
was, in fact, not profitable.

48:26.586 --> 48:30.088
But I still believe

48:30.123 --> 48:31.356
that it could be.

48:31.391 --> 48:33.058
No. No. That's not the plan.

48:33.093 --> 48:34.893
This is how it works.

48:34.928 --> 48:38.229
This is how Beyoncé
and Rod Stewart and Sting...

48:38.265 --> 48:40.231
This is how they start
their solo careers.

48:40.267 --> 48:42.434
They had to cut the deadwood.

48:42.469 --> 48:44.402
But you've
impressed me. You really have.

48:44.438 --> 48:47.238
And I hope you don't have to
go back to your numbers guys.

48:47.274 --> 48:48.618
Well, I am going back.
I'm going back tonight.

48:48.642 --> 48:49.741
I've got a ticket.

48:49.776 --> 48:51.443
Well, that's a shame.

48:51.478 --> 48:54.045
You have such a future in what's
left of show business.

48:54.081 --> 48:55.613
Where's the band?

48:58.318 --> 49:00.051
Tom and Christopher are talking.

49:00.087 --> 49:01.686
- What?
- Yeah.

49:01.722 --> 49:04.022
- They're talking?
- Mm.

49:04.057 --> 49:05.757
- After all our work?
- Yep.

49:05.792 --> 49:07.559
Fuck!

49:07.594 --> 49:08.860
Why did I even fly out here?

49:08.895 --> 49:11.029
My son has porocephaliasis again.

49:11.064 --> 49:12.297
By the way, Reg,

49:12.332 --> 49:14.699
you're finished in the music business.

49:14.735 --> 49:16.701
You're more dead than Phil.

49:16.737 --> 49:17.902
Good-bye, Preston.

49:38.358 --> 49:41.960
Okay, everybody, let's...

49:41.995 --> 49:43.595
Oh, come on, Bill.

49:43.630 --> 49:46.831
Let's go visit Phil, okay?

49:46.867 --> 49:48.800
Thank you. Just follow me.

49:48.835 --> 49:50.135
Oh, Christ alive, get ready.

50:02.816 --> 50:06.985
I... I have the answer to your mystery.

50:07.020 --> 50:09.120
Which one?

50:09.156 --> 50:11.856
I've got a few going.

50:11.892 --> 50:14.125
My dad... he...

50:14.161 --> 50:15.860
He liked to bet the horses.

50:15.896 --> 50:18.663
And, you know, there's one horse
that he liked the best.

50:18.698 --> 50:21.099
He chose her and bet on her early,

50:21.134 --> 50:23.668
and then every chance he could get.

50:23.703 --> 50:26.037
She was his favorite.

50:26.072 --> 50:27.939
Her name was Pistachio.

50:29.976 --> 50:31.943
He picked you.

50:33.814 --> 50:35.113
You got your nickname.

50:38.051 --> 50:39.651
Yeah.

50:39.686 --> 50:41.853
And it was bestowed.

50:46.259 --> 50:47.992
I'll tell you this,

50:48.028 --> 50:51.896
Phil did not want to be buried in a box.

50:51.932 --> 50:55.133
Now, he just happened to
tell us this two weeks ago

50:55.168 --> 50:56.801
on the ride to Tacoma.

50:56.837 --> 51:00.071
He said, "If anything happens
to me, and that light,

51:00.106 --> 51:03.341
that eternal flame, gets snuffed out,

51:03.376 --> 51:06.578
I want you to call Mitch
in New Orleans."

51:06.613 --> 51:09.080
Can you help me out, here?

51:09.115 --> 51:11.649
And this is just
two weeks ago, mind you.

51:11.685 --> 51:13.418
- I was there.
- Reg was there.

51:13.453 --> 51:18.256
So, as per his wishes, we called
Mitch from New Orleans,

51:18.291 --> 51:21.159
who is, without a doubt
one of the great specialists...

51:21.194 --> 51:22.393
Hey there, Mitch.

51:22.429 --> 51:23.995
- Anyhow, shall we?
- Yeah.

51:24.030 --> 51:25.563
Okay.

51:25.599 --> 51:27.232
Come on, everyone.

51:27.267 --> 51:28.833
Come on. Let's head on in, gang.

51:28.869 --> 51:30.468
Come on in. Come on in, everyone.

51:34.040 --> 51:35.206
Oh, my God.

51:35.242 --> 51:37.675
- There he is.
- Oh, wow.

51:37.711 --> 51:39.010
Okay...

51:39.045 --> 51:40.111
Aah!

51:40.146 --> 51:43.348
I can't quite fathom...

51:43.383 --> 51:46.618
I thought it would be something
weird like an open casket,

51:46.653 --> 51:48.453
- but this is...
- Dude.

51:48.488 --> 51:49.921
I know.

51:55.562 --> 51:57.762
Hi, Phil.

51:57.797 --> 51:58.796
Hi, Phil.

52:00.400 --> 52:01.799
There he is.

52:04.104 --> 52:05.937
Look at Phill.

52:07.741 --> 52:09.874
Dude,

52:09.910 --> 52:11.142
he wants us to hug him.

52:11.177 --> 52:13.144
- I mean...
- No. I can't.

52:13.179 --> 52:14.712
I mean, I cared a lot about the guy,

52:14.748 --> 52:17.548
but I'm not hugging a dead person.

52:17.584 --> 52:19.951
- He looks so life-like.
- Puna or Phil?

52:19.986 --> 52:22.553
Oh, it's a unique situation
to be sure. Yeah.

52:22.589 --> 52:24.389
Well, I mean, it is pretty much

52:24.424 --> 52:26.424
the way I was gonna remember him.

52:26.459 --> 52:28.993
Is he definitely... dead?

52:29.029 --> 52:30.929
- He is.
- He's not dead.

52:32.165 --> 52:34.632
His spirit is alive.

52:34.668 --> 52:36.134
Yeah, man.

52:36.169 --> 52:37.769
No, he's dead. He is dead.

52:37.804 --> 52:40.138
Phil's a fucking state of mind, dude.

52:40.173 --> 52:42.006
That's just the body that held him.

52:46.179 --> 52:49.814
Even though he sure looks
like he needs a hug.

52:49.849 --> 52:52.984
Yeah, it's been a night
of firsts on many levels,

52:53.019 --> 52:56.921
but yes, this goes
right to the top of the list.

52:56.957 --> 52:59.023
I think I'm gonna faint.
I'm just gonna...

52:59.059 --> 53:00.992
Okay, now. Yeah, have a seat, Milo.

53:01.027 --> 53:02.961
Take a load off. Take some deep breaths.

53:02.996 --> 53:06.297
Now... who'd like to go first?

53:07.667 --> 53:09.200
What do you say, Pistachio?

53:09.235 --> 53:13.304
I... I think I
might need to work up to it.

53:13.340 --> 53:14.339
He looks sad.

53:14.374 --> 53:15.451
Well, see, that's the thing.

53:15.475 --> 53:16.641
He's not. Right, Reg?

53:16.676 --> 53:17.709
He's not sad.

53:17.744 --> 53:19.544
This was Phil's final wish,

53:19.579 --> 53:22.313
to be at the crossroads
of human emotion,

53:22.349 --> 53:25.016
undertaking, and taxidermy.

53:25.051 --> 53:29.487
And that's right where we are.

53:29.522 --> 53:31.956
Maybe he knows I'm going to
prison for invasive flowers.

53:31.992 --> 53:34.025
Oh, Wes, you're not gonna go to prison.

53:34.060 --> 53:35.727
Not while I'm alive.

53:35.762 --> 53:39.664
All these people.

53:39.699 --> 53:41.199
These beautiful lights.

53:41.234 --> 53:44.168
And these musicians and these roadies.

53:44.204 --> 53:47.038
Kids and adults.

53:47.073 --> 53:50.341
We may never see these people again.

53:54.681 --> 53:56.314
This is probably what heaven's like.

53:56.349 --> 53:57.682
Hm.

53:57.717 --> 53:59.484
Copy that.

53:59.519 --> 54:00.752
Yeah.

54:06.760 --> 54:10.495
Okay. It's time to hug Phil.

54:10.530 --> 54:11.329
Yep.

54:13.433 --> 54:14.565
Come on in.

54:19.239 --> 54:20.605
Get in there, Wes.

54:22.909 --> 54:23.941
Oh, that's nice.

54:25.945 --> 54:26.911
There you go.

54:26.946 --> 54:28.346
Phil.

54:28.381 --> 54:29.580
Come on. He's stuck in.

54:31.317 --> 54:32.417
Kelly Ann?

54:33.753 --> 54:35.353
Aw, that's it.

54:35.388 --> 54:36.754
Yeah.

55:51.998 --> 55:53.664
Aah!

55:53.700 --> 55:56.167
- Oh, go, go, go!
- We're gonna miss you!

55:56.202 --> 55:58.369
You're gonna be a great mom.

56:37.610 --> 56:39.644
Is that you under there?

56:39.679 --> 56:41.212
Bloody hell.

56:41.247 --> 56:42.813
This is for you.

56:42.849 --> 56:44.182
No. No!

56:44.217 --> 56:45.550
- Yeah.
- No.

56:45.585 --> 56:47.351
- Yeah.
- It can't be.

56:47.387 --> 56:48.819
- Yes.
- Fuck.

56:48.855 --> 56:49.921
Yeah.

56:49.956 --> 56:51.856
Uh...

57:05.438 --> 57:06.737
It's my brown leather Fendi.

57:08.441 --> 57:10.241
It's been through a lot.

57:10.276 --> 57:11.475
Thank you.

57:14.113 --> 57:15.079
Listen...

57:15.114 --> 57:16.080
- Wait.
- What?

57:16.115 --> 57:18.249
I'm glad you got it back.

57:19.786 --> 57:22.887
It must be really wonderful

57:22.922 --> 57:25.856
to have your life back in order.

57:27.927 --> 57:30.561
I know that a lot happened
the other night.

57:30.597 --> 57:32.129
Before Phil.

57:32.165 --> 57:37.034
Um, I just want you to know

57:37.070 --> 57:40.304
that I remember everything.

57:43.176 --> 57:47.111
Before life and all
the other stuff stepped in.

57:47.146 --> 57:49.146
And...

57:51.618 --> 57:53.718
...was there more to say to each other?

57:53.753 --> 57:55.720
Yeah. Yeah, there's more.

57:55.755 --> 57:57.221
Would you like to summarize?

57:57.257 --> 57:59.090
Come with me.

58:01.194 --> 58:02.326
To England?

58:02.362 --> 58:04.729
Yes.

58:04.764 --> 58:05.830
Just come.

58:10.270 --> 58:11.602
I can't.

58:16.175 --> 58:18.776
Why not?

58:18.811 --> 58:21.112
Because I can't just follow
someone somewhere.

58:21.147 --> 58:22.358
You followed this band everywhere.

58:22.382 --> 58:24.815
That's different. So, so different.

58:24.851 --> 58:26.951
I know.

58:30.056 --> 58:32.690
I made another film.

58:34.394 --> 58:35.626
For you.

58:39.532 --> 58:41.432
Thank you.

58:48.975 --> 58:51.142
Okay.

58:52.745 --> 58:54.211
Good-bye.

58:54.247 --> 58:56.547
- Ugh.
- Yeah.

58:59.419 --> 59:00.851
Wait.

59:03.156 --> 59:05.690
Your Fendi.

59:05.725 --> 59:07.325
Oh, yeah.

59:12.365 --> 59:14.076
I'll take that...
I'll take that with me now.

59:15.435 --> 59:17.168
Okay.

59:17.203 --> 59:18.769
Thank you.

59:34.687 --> 59:35.920
There you are.

59:35.955 --> 59:37.355
Here I am.

59:37.390 --> 59:39.890
I broke in and stole a beer.

59:39.926 --> 59:41.659
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

59:41.694 --> 59:43.527
- Looks pretty good.
- It's pretty good.

59:43.563 --> 59:45.896
Totally worth it. Mm.

59:45.932 --> 59:48.099
- So, Shelli...
- Bill, I actually...

59:48.134 --> 59:50.368
Let me go first, okay? Just...

59:50.403 --> 59:51.402
Okay.

59:51.437 --> 59:53.437
I'm glad that I met him.

59:53.473 --> 59:55.406
I am. I'm glad.

59:56.809 --> 01:00:00.544
He's great. I can see that.

01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:02.947
He's got everything to make you happy.

01:00:02.982 --> 01:00:06.083
Everything that you deserve.

01:00:07.587 --> 01:00:09.854
And I have nothing like that,

01:00:09.889 --> 01:00:11.589
nothing to offer you.

01:00:13.793 --> 01:00:17.061
And I want what's best for you.

01:00:20.099 --> 01:00:23.634
And I know that he's the better choice.

01:00:23.669 --> 01:00:25.469
You're right.

01:00:25.505 --> 01:00:26.504
Yeah.

01:00:29.175 --> 01:00:30.875
But...

01:00:30.910 --> 01:00:32.610
I choose you.

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:36.747
I choose us.

01:00:36.783 --> 01:00:38.949
Yeah?

01:00:38.985 --> 01:00:40.551
Yeah. I told him I can't be with him.

01:00:40.586 --> 01:00:43.788
He went home.

01:00:43.823 --> 01:00:44.789
You did?

01:00:44.824 --> 01:00:46.257
Yep.

01:00:50.997 --> 01:00:54.498
No, Shelli, I meant what I said.

01:00:54.534 --> 01:00:59.036
That I can't give you
the life that you may want.

01:01:00.606 --> 01:01:02.406
And I don't know
what's left of this business,

01:01:02.442 --> 01:01:04.119
and I don't know where I'm
going from here, and...

01:01:04.143 --> 01:01:05.609
I don't care.

01:01:05.645 --> 01:01:07.311
It doesn't matter.

01:01:08.648 --> 01:01:12.683
Maybe it did at some point, but...

01:01:12.718 --> 01:01:16.287
...the Shelli that Sean used to know,

01:01:16.322 --> 01:01:19.857
he knew better than anyone.

01:01:19.892 --> 01:01:23.961
But now there's a whole new side of her

01:01:23.996 --> 01:01:29.633
that is totally foreign
to the original Shelli.

01:01:29.669 --> 01:01:33.637
Like a whole new being, really.

01:01:33.673 --> 01:01:36.373
And she doesn't feel right with him.

01:01:36.409 --> 01:01:38.776
She has no idea what to do now,

01:01:38.811 --> 01:01:41.512
but she knows what she can't do anymore.

01:01:43.516 --> 01:01:45.649
And she has you to thank for that.

01:01:45.685 --> 01:01:47.051
Is that so?

01:01:51.357 --> 01:01:52.823
All right.

01:01:55.661 --> 01:01:57.161
Now, should I be concerned

01:01:57.196 --> 01:01:58.307
that you're referring to yourself

01:01:58.331 --> 01:01:59.663
in the third person like that?

01:01:59.699 --> 01:02:01.332
- Probably.
- That's okay,

01:02:01.367 --> 01:02:03.367
'cause all the greats do
it at one time or another.

01:02:03.402 --> 01:02:04.735
And let me just say this.

01:02:04.770 --> 01:02:08.873
Bill Hanson might
not have all the answers,

01:02:08.908 --> 01:02:12.142
but Bill Hanson loves you.

01:02:12.178 --> 01:02:17.181
And he has for a very long time.

01:02:18.851 --> 01:02:20.818
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:02:20.853 --> 01:02:22.219
Know how I know that?

01:02:23.723 --> 01:02:25.923
'Cause Bill Hanson told me.

01:02:28.027 --> 01:02:28.926
He did.

01:02:28.961 --> 01:02:30.761
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:02:45.278 --> 01:02:47.845
Mm.

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:49.880
Now what?

01:02:52.718 --> 01:02:54.885
Well...

01:02:54.921 --> 01:02:58.422
I'm gonna let you finish that beer.

01:02:58.457 --> 01:03:00.925
And I'm gonna go take care
of a couple things.

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:04.261
All right then.

01:03:04.297 --> 01:03:06.530
Chick Hearn should have called this one.

01:03:13.839 --> 01:03:15.773
Whoo. Whoo!

01:03:15.808 --> 01:03:19.076
Fabulous Forum breeds winners!

01:03:19.111 --> 01:03:22.146
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

01:03:44.003 --> 01:03:48.772
All right, that's right, smile for me.
