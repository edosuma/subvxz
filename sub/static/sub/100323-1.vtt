Our unsub
is Everett Lynch.

00:03.820 --> 00:05.452
He's a con man
and a murderer

00:05.540 --> 00:08.516
who slices off the faces
of the women he seduces.

00:08.725 --> 00:11.522
Roberta Lynch.
Having a con woman for a mother

00:11.610 --> 00:14.121
would have instilled the narcissism
and misogyny that we profiled.

00:14.208 --> 00:15.993
This was the
first time that I was

00:16.079 --> 00:19.779
beaten by someone younger,
faster, stronger than I am.

00:21.825 --> 00:22.913
Daddy!

00:23.000 --> 00:24.915
We arrested
his daughter Grace,

00:25.002 --> 00:26.394
but he got away.

<i>You should take a look at my

03:02.780 --> 03:04.086
How do you like
my work?

03:07.991 --> 03:09.342
I need to...

03:10.295 --> 03:12.555
I... I need to
get out of here.

03:13.926 --> 03:15.172
N-No!

03:15.260 --> 03:17.492
N-No. Pl-please.

03:20.860 --> 03:22.164
Aah...

03:24.225 --> 03:25.953
Aah...

03:35.046 --> 03:37.953
I was not so sure
about hosting a baby shower

03:38.041 --> 03:40.435
for baby number 5!

03:40.523 --> 03:43.226
But Lisa keeps insisting
that it's not a shower.

03:43.391 --> 03:44.549
It's a sprinkle.

03:44.636 --> 03:47.219
Any addition
to the extended bau family

03:47.307 --> 03:50.075
is a cause to gather
and rejoice and to get loot

03:50.163 --> 03:51.703
in the form of baby swag.

03:52.305 --> 03:53.773
Well, we can't thank
you guys enough.

03:53.861 --> 03:56.125
- And when are you due?
- Oh, 8 weeks.

03:56.213 --> 03:58.306
And you're not even a little
curious if it's a boy or girl?

03:58.393 --> 04:00.830
I'm good, but Matt
is dying to know.

04:01.117 --> 04:02.959
But we decided
that since everything

04:03.046 --> 04:05.523
about this baby has just
been a wonderful surprise

04:05.611 --> 04:09.617
that we will once again be
surprised when he or she arrives.

04:09.704 --> 04:11.398
Ha ha ha!

04:11.920 --> 04:13.437
It's killing you,
bro.

04:13.525 --> 04:14.943
Yeah, kill-ing me.

04:15.031 --> 04:18.172
I came this close
to bribing the doctor.

04:18.260 --> 04:19.757
Oh! Hee hee!

04:23.121 --> 04:25.036
You would not believe
how long it took me

04:25.124 --> 04:26.735
to pick out that
baby rocker for them.

04:26.823 --> 04:27.875
I wouldn't beat
yourself up.

04:27.962 --> 04:30.551
You know, it's not easy to choose
the appropriate gift in this case.

04:30.638 --> 04:32.437
Yeah, but I think
my inability to choose

04:32.525 --> 04:35.062
stems from a recurring dream
I've had since I was a kid.

04:35.230 --> 04:38.450
I'm at a birthday,
and when a person finally opens their gift

04:38.538 --> 04:40.202
and sees it,
they burst into tears.

04:40.290 --> 04:41.975
Well, I would say that
your dream represents

04:42.063 --> 04:44.525
a disguised fulfillment
of a repressed wish.

04:44.712 --> 04:47.132
See? That's why
that guy was a genius.

04:49.312 --> 04:50.445
Everything ok?

04:50.533 --> 04:53.529
It's about my mom.
She's in a full-time care facility,

04:53.618 --> 04:54.821
and she's really
been struggling.

04:54.908 --> 04:56.179
I'm so sorry, Reid.

04:56.267 --> 04:58.356
It's ok. You know,
you prepare for the inevitable,

04:58.444 --> 05:01.874
but it's still difficult to accept
when things actually change.

05:02.691 --> 05:04.632
Makes you wish you
could go back in time

05:04.720 --> 05:06.853
and make sure you
made the right choices.

05:09.061 --> 05:11.249
So will
is outside right now

05:11.337 --> 05:15.249
drooling all over your
boyfriend's super-cool motorcycle.

05:15.337 --> 05:17.336
Ugh! Yeah,
I'm sorry about that.

05:17.424 --> 05:18.860
It's sexy,

05:18.947 --> 05:20.695
yet statistically stupid.

05:20.827 --> 05:22.171
Wait. Isn't that how
you got here?

05:22.259 --> 05:25.601
No, no. Hunting serial killers
is thrill enough for me.

05:25.689 --> 05:27.110
Besides, I had to
pick up the cake.

05:27.243 --> 05:29.501
Ah! It's a great
cake, by the way.

05:29.589 --> 05:30.939
Good.

05:31.143 --> 05:32.907
I haven't seen Dave
and crystal yet.

05:32.995 --> 05:34.214
It's not like him
to be late.

05:34.302 --> 05:35.696
No, it's not,

05:35.784 --> 05:38.524
although I'm sure
he'll have a good excuse.

05:38.651 --> 05:40.469
Do you want me
to call him? Ok.No, I'll call him.

05:49.243 --> 05:51.915
Hey, Emily.
I'm running late.

05:52.003 --> 05:54.309
<i>I should be on my way to you
guys, asap.</i>

05:54.556 --> 05:56.602
You know it's not
in our jurisdiction.

05:56.712 --> 05:57.914
I-I called.

05:58.122 --> 06:00.806
Captain Paige said she'd
be more than willing to...

06:00.894 --> 06:02.229
Dave, I have been
more than willing

06:02.316 --> 06:05.048
to give you a lot of latitude
on the Everett Lynch case.

06:05.168 --> 06:06.204
I know you have.

06:06.292 --> 06:07.942
But over the past 6 months,

06:08.030 --> 06:09.673
you have taken it
upon yourself

06:09.804 --> 06:11.806
to conduct a solo
manhunt for the guy.

06:11.894 --> 06:13.591
It just can't continue.

06:14.211 --> 06:15.836
I-I'm sorry I didn't
tell you that...

06:15.924 --> 06:17.565
You want to know
what worries me the most?

06:17.652 --> 06:21.196
I think you didn't tell me because
you weren't sure how to lie to me.

06:21.407 --> 06:24.009
Anyway, now really isn't
the time to discuss this.

06:24.150 --> 06:25.891
We'll talk about this later.

06:28.191 --> 06:30.939
SSA Rossi!

06:31.206 --> 06:34.514
I appreciate you taking the
time, captain Paige.

06:34.602 --> 06:36.381
Oh, sir,
no problem at all.

06:36.469 --> 06:38.816
And I can tell you,
the Baltimore county sheriff's department

06:38.904 --> 06:41.203
will do whatever it can to
help you catch the chameleon.

06:41.922 --> 06:43.110
The what?

06:43.198 --> 06:45.113
The chameleon, sir.

06:45.307 --> 06:47.267
That's what everybody's
been calling him.

06:47.384 --> 06:50.524
I think it started at the
Baltimore field office as a joke,

06:50.744 --> 06:55.139
you know, because Everett Lynch is
like this master of disguise, right?

06:57.263 --> 06:58.595
Ok.

06:58.949 --> 07:02.256
Let me take you up this hill
right here to the crime scene.

07:03.697 --> 07:06.040
A photographer working
for the audubon society,

07:06.128 --> 07:07.521
she tripped over the body.

07:07.814 --> 07:10.939
Well, not literally.
I mean, she found our John Doe

07:11.027 --> 07:12.368
lying right there,

07:12.456 --> 07:15.259
arms, legs spread out,
flat on his back,

07:15.347 --> 07:16.384
possibly posed.

07:16.472 --> 07:18.030
Looks like he'd been
lying there for a while

07:18.118 --> 07:19.310
before he was found.

07:19.397 --> 07:21.574
Yeah, well, our county
coroner, Dr. Jewel,

07:21.661 --> 07:23.401
he didn't have very
many answers for us,

07:23.488 --> 07:26.187
but he guesstimated
3 to 5 days.

07:26.587 --> 07:31.497
The skin around the torso had
been removed deliberately.

07:31.584 --> 07:32.889
That's what I thought.

07:32.976 --> 07:35.718
But once again,
Dr. Jewel said he didn't think so

07:35.805 --> 07:37.067
because of the
animal predation.

07:37.154 --> 07:39.113
Looks like an
open skinning to me.

07:39.200 --> 07:42.508
Ok, but Everett Lynch,
he took faces,

07:42.595 --> 07:44.642
women's faces,
as trophies, right?

07:44.730 --> 07:45.894
Yes, he did.

07:45.982 --> 07:49.765
Ok, so, then, why are you guys
thinking this man's murder

07:49.853 --> 07:51.798
has anything to do
with him?

07:52.213 --> 07:54.007
Everett Lynch took
women's faces

07:54.095 --> 07:57.235
because he's
a deranged misogynist.

07:57.584 --> 08:00.152
His hatred of women
is also tied to

08:00.240 --> 08:02.895
his malignant
narcissism.

08:03.224 --> 08:05.366
Problem is, his
obsession with himself

08:05.454 --> 08:08.110
has its wires crossed...

08:09.057 --> 08:13.110
'Cause Lynch has no idea
who he really is.

08:15.234 --> 08:18.419
He has no
rue identity.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.634
And now that
he's on the run,

08:21.721 --> 08:23.636
he's uncomfortable
in his own skin.

08:23.723 --> 08:26.595
And he's transferred
his violent compulsion

08:26.682 --> 08:30.512
from women he hates
to men he envies.

08:30.599 --> 08:32.514
So if you're right,
then,

08:32.601 --> 08:36.212
this man can't possibly be
Lynch's only male victim.

08:36.299 --> 08:41.196
It isn't, but we're gonna use
these men to get under his skin.

08:42.405 --> 08:47.657
We're gonna use them to catch
this sick son of a bitch.

Who's asking?

Dave.

09:55.084 --> 09:57.086
Hello, Dave.

09:57.173 --> 09:59.681
My father give
that to you?

10:00.251 --> 10:01.298
Yeah.

10:01.386 --> 10:05.259
You let me sit in here for 2
days before making your play.

10:05.962 --> 10:07.626
48 hours...

10:07.987 --> 10:11.431
2,880 minutes...

10:12.754 --> 10:14.681
For me to melt down,

10:14.930 --> 10:18.749
then you to waltz in here waving
a getoutof-jail - free card.

10:18.857 --> 10:21.506
That is... if...

10:21.970 --> 10:24.276
I dime out my daddy.

10:24.780 --> 10:26.225
He sold you out.

10:26.313 --> 10:27.467
He didn't sell me out.

10:27.555 --> 10:29.470
Look where the hell
you are.

10:29.585 --> 10:32.686
Without my help,
you're gonna die in here.

10:32.774 --> 10:34.186
Do you understand that?

10:34.274 --> 10:37.359
Pardon? Qu'est-ce que
vous avez dit?

10:38.460 --> 10:41.617
What would we
not do for family?

10:42.703 --> 10:44.414
So how do I make you
understand

10:44.502 --> 10:47.469
that your love and
your loyalty is wasted,

10:47.907 --> 10:52.347
that your "daddy" only
cares about one thing...

10:54.689 --> 10:56.255
Himself.

10:58.173 --> 10:59.566
Guard!

11:04.914 --> 11:06.502
Did you make
a formal request

11:06.596 --> 11:08.443
for an expanded air
and ground search

11:08.531 --> 11:09.733
of parks
in Baltimore county?

11:09.821 --> 11:11.844
Yes, I did, but... but nothing.

11:11.932 --> 11:13.764
That request needed
to go through my office.

11:13.852 --> 11:15.930
So now's the time
we need to talk.

11:16.018 --> 11:20.022
Dave, you were right.
They just found another body.

11:20.600 --> 11:23.475
This deceased gentleman
is John Doe number 2.

11:23.563 --> 11:24.879
He was found about
an hour ago

11:24.966 --> 11:27.459
deep in the woods of the
Ellis pines regional park.

11:27.547 --> 11:29.601
Might be harder to
tell with John Doe number 1,

11:29.688 --> 11:33.192
but with number 2 here, it's pretty
clear animals didn't tear off his skin.

11:33.279 --> 11:34.948
There's no question
we're dealing with an unsub

11:35.036 --> 11:36.978
wrestling with violent
sexual impulses.

11:37.065 --> 11:38.791
However, neither the
staging of the bodies

11:38.879 --> 11:40.807
nor the removal
of their torsos' skin

11:40.895 --> 11:43.180
speaks to the same
manifestation of lust violence

11:43.268 --> 11:44.769
expressed in Everett
Lynch's previous kills.

11:44.856 --> 11:46.479
That manifestation
is evolving,

11:46.567 --> 11:49.288
and I think it started the moment he
thought about cutting off my face.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.547
But he didn't or
couldn't because he had

11:51.635 --> 11:53.503
at least enough control
over himself to understand

11:53.590 --> 11:56.158
that killing an FBI agent
would bring the full weight

11:56.261 --> 11:57.342
of law enforcement
down on him.

11:57.429 --> 11:59.958
Our original profile
of Lynch didn't indicate

12:00.046 --> 12:01.558
any sexual fluidity,
and without that,

12:01.646 --> 12:03.402
I don't see how we'd be able
to shift his victimology

12:03.489 --> 12:04.317
from women to men.

12:04.405 --> 12:05.966
Also,
why would our guy go

12:06.054 --> 12:08.796
from burning his victims trying
to make it look like an accident?

12:09.362 --> 12:10.948
And now he's just
leaving them somewhere

12:11.036 --> 12:12.512
where they can be
obviously found?

12:12.600 --> 12:14.255
Right now,
I-I don't want any of

12:14.343 --> 12:16.420
us to presume anything
about this case.

12:16.508 --> 12:19.458
JJ, Spence, I'd like you to walk
the crime scene at Ellis pines.

12:19.546 --> 12:22.806
Matt, Luke, Baltimore county is
sending a new pathologist in.

12:22.894 --> 12:24.885
I need you to coordinate
with whomever that is.

12:24.973 --> 12:27.143
Tara and Dave,
focus on victimology.

12:27.231 --> 12:30.060
Whoever we're dealing with here
is still clearly on the hunt.

12:59.159 --> 13:00.252
Whoa! Oh, my...!

13:00.340 --> 13:03.032
Ohh! I got you.

13:05.554 --> 13:07.033
Sorry.

13:07.559 --> 13:10.127
Agents!
The crime scene is right this way.

13:13.173 --> 13:15.567
I have to say, there's
not a lot of differences

13:15.654 --> 13:17.960
between this dump site
and the last one we found.

13:18.047 --> 13:19.734
They do appear
to be similar.

13:19.822 --> 13:23.608
Right? Well, don't let
me get in your way.

13:26.025 --> 13:29.455
Not exactly a place
you stumble upon at random.

13:29.581 --> 13:32.432
Our unsub's gotta be familiar
with a location like this.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.174
Intimately.
He feels safe here.

13:34.281 --> 13:35.848
There's privacy.
He could take his time,

13:35.935 --> 13:38.155
potentially come back
to revisit the victims.

13:38.242 --> 13:40.680
But so far, everything
we know about Everett Lynch

13:40.768 --> 13:43.029
places him and his
various aliases

13:43.116 --> 13:44.726
pretty firmly in the
Southern United States.

13:44.813 --> 13:47.468
Mississippi, Tennessee,
Arkansas... obsessively following

13:47.555 --> 13:49.209
in the footsteps
of his mother Roberta.

13:49.296 --> 13:51.951
It doesn't mean he hasn't spent
any time in the state of Maryland.

13:52.038 --> 13:53.996
Just another thing that's
distinctly off-pattern,

13:54.083 --> 13:56.869
you know, like the way that
he disposed of this body.

13:56.956 --> 13:59.922
Everett Lynch has never shown a
desire to revisit his victims.

14:00.010 --> 14:01.564
That's why he burned them
and took their faces.

14:01.651 --> 14:05.443
Ok. But then why take
the skins, right?

14:05.729 --> 14:09.135
If we're really thinking that
this could be a new unsub,

14:09.708 --> 14:11.945
who's compelled to
revisit and relive?

14:12.033 --> 14:13.931
That's a good question and
one that needs to be answered

14:14.018 --> 14:15.144
by building
a whole new profile,

14:15.231 --> 14:17.221
not by transposing
Everett Lynch's.

14:17.309 --> 14:19.876
Well, from your mouth
to Rossi's ears.

14:21.307 --> 14:23.111
Agents, let me
assure you again

14:23.199 --> 14:25.250
that I have no ego
to bruise here.

14:25.346 --> 14:29.553
And so making this transition from
myself to Dr. Sebastian hurst here...

14:29.641 --> 14:31.991
Agents alvez
and Simmons?

14:32.078 --> 14:35.081
I'm Dr. Hurst, the
ocme Baltimore city,

14:35.168 --> 14:36.961
and, yes,
I have been assigned to take over

14:37.049 --> 14:39.346
the post-mortem investigation
of your John does

14:39.433 --> 14:41.870
from the county
coroner, Dr. Jewel.

14:41.957 --> 14:44.786
And, as I was saying,
no problem.

14:44.873 --> 14:47.461
I very much liken this to
asking for a second opinion

14:47.549 --> 14:48.502
after a diagnosis.

14:48.590 --> 14:51.227
Well, I haven't had a chance to
re-examine John Doe number 1,

14:51.315 --> 14:53.578
but I have finished
with the latest victim,

14:53.665 --> 14:56.711
who does remain
unidentified.

14:56.798 --> 14:59.410
Petechial hemorrhaging,
that you can see right here,

14:59.497 --> 15:03.675
strongly suggests that his death
was the result of asphyxiation.

15:03.762 --> 15:05.643
But you found
no defense wounds.

15:05.752 --> 15:07.983
I didn't. I suspect
he was sedated.

15:08.070 --> 15:10.813
I've requested an extended
toxicology panel.

15:10.901 --> 15:14.076
Looks as if the torso
skin was removed post-mortem.

15:14.163 --> 15:15.260
And that's correct.

15:15.348 --> 15:16.986
However, I believe
there was some mention

15:17.074 --> 15:19.838
of this possibly being
an open skinning?

15:19.926 --> 15:22.083
Yes, because of
the manner of removal,

15:22.171 --> 15:23.604
like... like a jacket.

15:23.692 --> 15:26.052
And why I'd agree that the skin
around the torso was removed

15:26.262 --> 15:28.273
in a manner similar
to this method,

15:28.361 --> 15:31.743
I would have to disagree that it was
performed by someone like a hunter.

15:31.831 --> 15:32.595
Why is that?

15:32.683 --> 15:34.183
It's dissected,
precisely,

15:34.270 --> 15:36.142
not with some kind of
hunter's knife either...

15:36.229 --> 15:37.604
More likely a scalpel.

15:37.692 --> 15:41.518
So maybe a hunter who picked up
some extra skills watching YouTube?

15:42.983 --> 15:46.673
Dr. Hurst, where are we on the
victim's DNA, fingerprints?

15:46.761 --> 15:49.634
Actually, that is where I
come back in to the picture.

15:49.721 --> 15:52.289
And to be sure, everything
has been collected

15:52.376 --> 15:55.292
and placed into the national
missing persons' database.

15:55.379 --> 15:58.338
So we're just waiting to
see if we get a hit.

15:59.513 --> 16:02.777
Yes, indeedy!
We just got a hit that looks like

16:02.864 --> 16:06.390
our John Doe number 2 has been
identified as Daniel Kane,

16:06.627 --> 16:09.654
born and raised and still just
trying to live his best life

16:09.741 --> 16:11.264
down there in
Miami beach, Florida.

16:11.351 --> 16:13.135
So what was his connection
to Baltimore county, Maryland?

16:13.222 --> 16:15.703
Oh, that's the thing.
Nobody knew what he was doing in Maryland.

16:15.790 --> 16:17.227
I am still
struggling to understand

16:17.315 --> 16:19.185
how Lynch could just
shift his victimology

16:19.272 --> 16:21.405
from 40-something women
with college-age kids

16:21.492 --> 16:24.973
to 20-something men with
practically no baggage to check.

16:25.060 --> 16:27.672
It all comes down to the fact
that Lynch's psychosexual needs

16:27.759 --> 16:31.096
don't conform to a specific
sexual preference.

16:31.184 --> 16:33.751
That's where we were wrong
in our initial profile.

16:33.839 --> 16:35.291
You really think
we were wrong?

16:35.379 --> 16:37.245
Yes. It's about
what he covets.

16:37.333 --> 16:39.379
And even though he's
wrestling with his conscience,

16:39.466 --> 16:41.290
- he's still aware...
- Aware enough to knowingly

16:41.377 --> 16:43.209
shift his violent impulses

16:43.296 --> 16:44.384
from the women
to the men

16:44.471 --> 16:45.588
Because it would
keep him

16:45.684 --> 16:46.682
from popping up
on our radar.

16:46.853 --> 16:48.169
But how's this
for a pop?

16:48.257 --> 16:50.695
Daniel Kane posted
a profile on date craze.

16:50.861 --> 16:52.566
That's one of the dating
websites that Everett Lynch used

16:52.653 --> 16:54.349
to stalk his
female victims.

16:54.437 --> 16:56.544
Penelope, I need you to track
down every connection Daniel made

16:56.632 --> 16:59.114
with anyone who even so much
as glanced at that site.

16:59.202 --> 17:00.223
You got it.

17:02.845 --> 17:05.012
<i> Gregory, I'm so sorry.</i>

17:05.099 --> 17:07.182
<i>I'm almost ready.
Do come inside.</i>

17:07.270 --> 17:11.186
<i>I've opened a bottle of wine,
so please make yourself at home.</i>

17:11.431 --> 17:14.239
Ok. Cool.
No worries.

17:14.327 --> 17:16.111
Take your time.

17:16.198 --> 17:17.896
I got all night.

17:39.918 --> 17:41.485
So handsome.

17:41.572 --> 17:44.291
You honestly have no
idea how refreshing it is

17:44.488 --> 17:45.619
to finally meet
a young man

17:45.706 --> 17:47.971
who's true to his
description of himself

17:48.059 --> 17:50.238
in those
dating profiles.

17:51.089 --> 17:53.410
Why? Because I
actually agreed to come out here

17:53.497 --> 17:55.237
and spend time
with a complete stranger?

17:55.441 --> 17:56.965
Yes.

17:57.994 --> 18:00.242
I'd say that certifies
what you boasted as

18:00.329 --> 18:03.332
your sense of adventure.

18:14.678 --> 18:17.791
You know, um...
I better slow down.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.749
<i>Do you
mind if I take your picture...</i>

18:22.836 --> 18:26.920
<i>Picture... picture...
Picture...</i>

19:15.012 --> 19:16.432
You wanted to see me?

19:16.520 --> 19:19.945
Yeah. I just got off the phone
with the Arkansas Attorney General.

19:20.033 --> 19:22.055
Grace Lynch wants to
make a deal.

19:22.143 --> 19:23.524
Now she wants to talk?

19:23.612 --> 19:25.092
And she wants to
talk to you.

19:25.179 --> 19:26.912
So I've arranged her
transfer to D.C.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.073
She'll be here
tomorrow morning.

19:28.160 --> 19:29.471
Emily... I've also requested

19:29.559 --> 19:31.700
the transfer of
Lynch's mother Roberta.

19:31.787 --> 19:33.528
I think we overlooked
an opportunity

19:33.615 --> 19:37.532
to play the two most important women
in Lynch's life against each other.

19:39.758 --> 19:42.619
We don't need them now,
either one.

19:42.707 --> 19:47.213
With this new victimology,
we're very close to taking Lynch down.

19:47.370 --> 19:49.627
We don't know that,
not for sure.

19:49.715 --> 19:51.630
And honestly,
I am concerned

19:51.718 --> 19:55.244
that by your insisting we
superimpose Lynch's profile

19:55.339 --> 19:56.818
over these new crimes,

19:56.905 --> 19:59.516
it's possible that
we could allow Lynch

19:59.604 --> 20:01.519
and some other unsub
to get away.

20:01.606 --> 20:03.434
I would never
allow that to happen.

20:03.522 --> 20:05.480
If your head is
really in the game,

20:05.689 --> 20:08.371
I would expect you to be able
to see through their lies

20:08.577 --> 20:11.054
and profile what
they've been hiding.

20:12.448 --> 20:14.445
Curious and curiouser.

20:14.532 --> 20:17.505
Daniel Kane books a round-trip
flight from Miami to Baltimore,

20:17.593 --> 20:19.538
but the credit card
used to pay for that

20:19.626 --> 20:22.890
belongs to someone
named Terrence Folger.

20:23.358 --> 20:25.155
Ok, so, who is this
Terrence Folger?

20:25.243 --> 20:28.551
Ok, he's from
Dallas, and...

20:28.897 --> 20:30.294
Do you think it's
a coinkydink

20:30.382 --> 20:32.491
that he also has
a profile on date craze?

20:32.579 --> 20:35.348
And bears a striking
resemblance to Daniel Kane.

20:35.436 --> 20:37.006
Ok, so what else do we
know about this Folger?

20:37.093 --> 20:39.474
Does he use any other dating
sites or social media platforms?

20:39.561 --> 20:42.051
Yes... and no.
As far as I can tell,

20:42.139 --> 20:43.909
a once-avid
social media user,

20:43.996 --> 20:46.259
he has neither liked
nor shared nor uploaded

20:46.346 --> 20:48.783
anything in well
over a month.

20:48.870 --> 20:51.003
Well, something tells me
that this Terrence Folger

20:51.090 --> 20:53.310
didn't go to ground because
he killed Daniel Kane.

20:53.397 --> 20:54.746
I think he's our
John Doe number 1.

20:54.833 --> 20:56.095
Yeah, and the unsub's using

20:56.182 --> 20:57.749
the credit card
to cover his tracks.

20:59.185 --> 21:02.710
Oh, no. They just found
another body.

21:10.066 --> 21:12.329
A ranger spotted
him from the road.

21:12.536 --> 21:14.973
Now, I mean, if this guy
just carried the body

21:15.061 --> 21:17.116
a few more feet over there,
it would be out of sight.

21:17.203 --> 21:19.075
As if he'd planned
on disposing of the body

21:19.162 --> 21:20.293
somewhere else
in the park,

21:20.380 --> 21:21.991
somewhere similar to his
previous dump sites,

21:22.078 --> 21:23.209
but then at
the last moment,

21:23.296 --> 21:25.081
changed his mind
and left it here.

21:25.241 --> 21:27.822
We stepped up our patrols of
all the parklands in the county.

21:27.909 --> 21:31.879
Maybe he sees one of us rolling by and
decides this place will have to do.

21:31.967 --> 21:34.100
You asked me earlier why
he would take the skins

21:34.188 --> 21:35.617
if he also planned on
coming back to visit.

21:35.704 --> 21:39.225
I think he wasn't sure which
he preferred until now.

21:39.774 --> 21:43.169
And holding onto those
trophies is working for him.

21:43.273 --> 21:45.332
So why waste time?
What he really needs

21:45.420 --> 21:47.103
is to get back out there
and hunt for more.

21:47.190 --> 21:50.323
But I thought taking trophies has
always been the chameleon's thing.

21:50.460 --> 21:52.668
Sorry. I know I'm not
supposed to call him that.

21:52.756 --> 21:54.806
Not so much, but your
point is well taken.

21:54.893 --> 21:57.113
This doesn't feel like
an unsub who's evolving,

21:57.499 --> 22:00.812
more like one who's just gotten
a real taste for what he needs

22:00.899 --> 22:03.170
and is about to go
on a feeding frenzy.

22:04.069 --> 22:06.296
The DNA confirmed
Dr. Lewis' prediction

22:06.383 --> 22:08.967
that Doe number 1
is Terrence Folger.

22:09.116 --> 22:10.604
And this should be
of interest to you.

22:10.691 --> 22:12.911
According to our extended
toxicology panel,

22:12.998 --> 22:15.356
your first two victims...
Mr. Folger and Mr. Kane...

22:15.444 --> 22:18.221
Were both significantly dosed
with sodium thiopentol.

22:18.308 --> 22:20.223
That's a short-acting
barbiturate.

22:20.310 --> 22:22.834
Yes. It's generally been
used to induce medical comas,

22:22.921 --> 22:24.270
not something that's
easy to come by.

22:24.357 --> 22:26.751
No, not unless you're
in the medical field.

22:27.108 --> 22:30.146
Well, isn't there a black market
for nearly anything these days?

22:30.991 --> 22:32.452
There is.

22:32.539 --> 22:34.856
Sodium thiopentol
is an unusual drug

22:34.944 --> 22:37.319
for anybody to go out
of their way to acquire.

22:38.006 --> 22:41.019
I think this just might start to
shift the focus of our profile.

22:41.287 --> 22:44.116
Ok, our John Doe
number 3 has been identified

22:44.203 --> 22:45.291
as Gregory broder.

22:45.378 --> 22:47.511
He's an architect
from Atlanta, Georgia.

22:47.598 --> 22:50.241
He was looking for love, in what we
now know is really the wrong place,

22:50.312 --> 22:52.053
the dating website
date craze.

22:52.140 --> 22:54.620
He wasn't communicating with them
through the website directly.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.919
Instead, he used cloned accounts
on direct messaging apps.

22:57.006 --> 22:58.716
But it's odd he'd
choose this dating site

22:58.803 --> 23:01.060
when he could easily stalk his
victims on any social network.

23:01.147 --> 23:03.586
Why would he evolve
every aspect of his m.O.

23:03.673 --> 23:06.110
Except how he solicits
his victims online?

23:06.197 --> 23:09.928
He might be holding onto one habit
to make sure he gets my attention.

23:12.934 --> 23:14.283
Your attention?

23:14.725 --> 23:16.942
Dave, do you think it's
possible that this raw emotion

23:17.030 --> 23:19.254
that you have for Lynch
could be distorting the lens

23:19.341 --> 23:21.023
you're using to interpret
the behavior here?

23:21.110 --> 23:24.356
No. My gut and years
of experience

23:24.444 --> 23:27.536
tell me that Everett Lynch
is behind all of this.

23:27.624 --> 23:29.699
I think there are times
we all can lose sight of bias

23:29.786 --> 23:31.179
and the doctrine
of chances.

23:31.266 --> 23:33.659
We're presented with an
unsub that demonstrates

23:33.746 --> 23:36.385
an extreme sexualized violence,
so it's inevitable to think

23:36.473 --> 23:37.576
that it's got
to be Lynch.

23:37.663 --> 23:39.013
Now, what are
the chances?

23:39.223 --> 23:41.346
But that's actually
our own bias

23:41.434 --> 23:43.543
putting forth
a false presumption.

23:43.631 --> 23:46.278
Don't you think these
profiles are clearly differentiated

23:46.366 --> 23:47.356
by the autopsy evidence?

23:47.444 --> 23:49.690
I mean, Lynch can't cut
like a surgeon.

23:49.778 --> 23:52.374
Now, why go to the trouble
of using sodium thiopentol?

23:52.461 --> 23:55.290
You factor that in with the
recklessness at the last dumpsite,

23:55.377 --> 23:57.770
and it gets easier to piece
together the motivations

23:57.857 --> 23:59.337
of a very different
unsub than Lynch,

23:59.424 --> 24:01.557
someone more like
an Edward gein...

24:01.644 --> 24:03.602
A guy who was so
uncomfortable in his own skin

24:03.689 --> 24:05.822
that he craved to possess
a new one, literally.

24:05.909 --> 24:07.998
And that pathology
can manifest itself

24:08.085 --> 24:10.000
in somebody with
a physical deformity

24:10.087 --> 24:12.100
or who suffered
a scarring injury,

24:12.188 --> 24:14.959
somebody who's obsessively self-conscious
about his own physical appearance.

24:15.046 --> 24:16.694
What if Lynch
has taken on a partner,

24:16.781 --> 24:18.613
like he did with Grace?

24:18.701 --> 24:21.533
No. I don't think so.
Grace was an exception.

24:21.620 --> 24:25.178
She's his daughter, but he only
partnered with her for expediency.

24:25.266 --> 24:26.662
He's really a solo act.

24:26.750 --> 24:28.192
Which would mean
we are dealing with

24:28.279 --> 24:30.281
two separate and
distinct cases here.

24:32.979 --> 24:35.808
Dave, I'd like you to keep your
focus on the Everett Lynch case.

24:35.895 --> 24:38.768
Grace and Roberta will
arrive in D.C. tomorrow.

24:38.855 --> 24:41.091
The rest of us, we need to
turn our attention to a doctor,

24:41.178 --> 24:42.424
most likely a surgeon,

24:42.511 --> 24:44.774
who lives and works
somewhere in Baltimore county.

25:37.304 --> 25:40.139
Well, sure looks like
working for the city

25:40.227 --> 25:42.352
pays a whole lot better
than working for the county.

25:42.440 --> 25:44.318
To be honest, I didn't pay
for this property.

25:44.406 --> 25:46.625
No, no.
It was inherited.

25:47.427 --> 25:49.693
Yeah. Anyway,
I can wait out here

25:49.781 --> 25:51.130
while you get
whatever you need.

25:51.218 --> 25:53.438
No, no, no, no. Please come in.
I won't be a moment.

25:53.590 --> 25:57.289
After that, I know this
marvelous little szechuan place.

26:32.159 --> 26:33.247
You should answer that.

26:34.672 --> 26:37.764
Of course, I can say
with 100% certainty

26:37.852 --> 26:41.639
that I'm the least-qualified person
to be giving out relationship advice.

26:42.169 --> 26:43.834
You're better at it
than you think.

26:43.951 --> 26:46.990
Ok. I hope I didn't sound like I
was dismissing your instincts.

26:47.078 --> 26:48.897
And my 40 years
of experience?

26:48.985 --> 26:50.639
I'm sorry.
That was not my...

26:50.726 --> 26:52.334
I'm kidding.

26:54.424 --> 26:55.928
You were right.

26:56.016 --> 26:58.295
I'm letting it
get too personal.

26:58.383 --> 27:01.299
I'm losing some perspective...
Seeing what I want,

27:01.387 --> 27:03.621
ignoring what
I can't explain.

27:03.709 --> 27:04.827
Well, that makes
two of us.

27:04.914 --> 27:06.069
How's that?

27:06.157 --> 27:09.352
I've been so focused trying to
ignore the parallels between Lynch's

27:09.440 --> 27:11.944
profile and this new unsub that
I've refused to ask myself...

27:12.032 --> 27:14.608
Why would a seasoned doctor
with a lot of pent-up,

27:14.696 --> 27:18.750
lust-murdering rage 4 weeks
ago out of the clear blue

27:18.838 --> 27:20.536
decide to act out?

27:20.624 --> 27:22.191
Exactly. And when
he does act out,

27:22.279 --> 27:25.116
he's able to commit crimes with
an expertise rarely exhibited

27:25.204 --> 27:28.123
by even the most
prolific of serial killers.

27:28.366 --> 27:30.368
What are the chances?

27:37.607 --> 27:39.478
So what triggers
this guy?

27:40.770 --> 27:42.250
Or who?

28:04.287 --> 28:05.912
What do you think?

28:06.000 --> 28:10.265
Modern art is...
Not my cup of tea.

28:10.646 --> 28:13.905
It is
an acquired taste.

28:13.993 --> 28:15.475
Uh... ohh...

28:20.897 --> 28:22.246
Oh...

28:28.861 --> 28:30.254
Oh...

28:42.858 --> 28:45.078
Dave, please tell me you
didn't spend the night here.

28:45.303 --> 28:47.605
No. I got in early.
Couldn't sleep.

28:47.693 --> 28:49.881
Oh. Did they notify
you about the delay?

28:50.005 --> 28:51.873
Grace Lynch is
swapping out lawyers,

28:51.961 --> 28:54.543
so she'll be arriving at the U.S.
attorney's office around noon,

28:54.631 --> 28:56.615
so now maybe an hour
after Roberta.

28:56.703 --> 28:58.618
Thank you. I can use
the extra time.

28:58.706 --> 29:02.139
You know, Reid got me thinking
about something last night.

29:02.358 --> 29:05.027
I started to compile a list of
doctors who fit the profile.

29:05.115 --> 29:06.171
Let me stop you there.

29:06.258 --> 29:09.566
I really need your undivided
attention on Grace and Roberta.

29:09.897 --> 29:11.490
Penelope and Tara
have something.

29:11.578 --> 29:13.971
Call me after you
speak with Roberta.

29:16.764 --> 29:18.832
This was in the lost-and-found.
I figured it was yours.

29:18.920 --> 29:19.803
What did you guys find?

29:19.914 --> 29:22.159
Ok, so Tara and I
had anticipated

29:22.247 --> 29:23.945
that Gregory broder's
travel itinerary

29:24.032 --> 29:27.926
would have been paid for by the
previous victim, Daniel Kane.

29:28.014 --> 29:30.037
However, hold a flag
on the play.

29:30.125 --> 29:32.311
It was paid for
by a credit card

29:32.399 --> 29:34.129
issued to someone
named Arthur Terrell.

29:34.442 --> 29:37.133
Now, this Arthur Terrell doesn't
fit the victimology at all.

29:37.306 --> 29:38.842
Nope. He looks like this.

29:39.003 --> 29:41.647
At 47, he's twice the
age of the other victims,

29:41.742 --> 29:43.140
doesn't look as if
he frequents the gym.

29:43.227 --> 29:45.706
He's a private attorney who lives
and works in Frederick, Maryland.

29:45.793 --> 29:47.170
And I
quadruple checked.

29:47.258 --> 29:48.956
He is not listed
as a missing person.

29:49.192 --> 29:52.225
He actually does check several of
the boxes for our potential unsub,

29:52.313 --> 29:54.577
except for one...
He's not a doctor.

29:55.108 --> 29:57.529
Well, that still makes
Mr. Arthur Terrell

29:57.617 --> 29:59.141
a person of
very special interest.

29:59.229 --> 30:02.098
Penelope, I want you to distribute
his home and office addresses

30:02.186 --> 30:03.244
to the rest of the team.

30:03.332 --> 30:04.934
We'll coordinate them
from here.

30:05.022 --> 30:06.770
I got it, got it.

31:06.875 --> 31:08.180
Ok, we'll take
the front.

31:08.298 --> 31:09.343
Ok, we got the back.

31:09.485 --> 31:11.600
You two with me.
You two back him up.

31:14.561 --> 31:15.566
FBI!

31:20.016 --> 31:22.467
We have unexpected company.

31:28.435 --> 31:30.393
Captain Paige,
we're going in.

31:33.201 --> 31:35.248
Dr. Hurst.
Yes.

31:35.748 --> 31:37.186
Ssa David Rossi.

31:37.274 --> 31:39.015
Arthur Terrell, FBI!

31:39.103 --> 31:41.836
I know you're a vp with
the Maryland medical board,

31:41.924 --> 31:44.056
so I thought you
might be of some help.

31:44.144 --> 31:46.654
Well, I certainly
will try.

31:46.742 --> 31:51.743
Now, I have a list of
doctors from around here...

31:51.831 --> 31:53.983
- Mm-hmm.
- Current and retired.

31:54.230 --> 31:56.325
- Mostly surgeons.
- Mmm.

31:56.413 --> 31:59.196
I'd love to go over
the names with you.

31:59.421 --> 32:01.290
- Clear!
- Clear!

32:01.378 --> 32:02.554
Clear.

32:03.104 --> 32:04.104
There's no one here.

32:04.218 --> 32:07.090
I'm going to describe
a few personal traits

32:07.178 --> 32:10.762
that are very likely true of
the person we're looking for.

32:10.850 --> 32:14.332
- Hopefully...
- I'll be able to identify that man

32:14.419 --> 32:16.126
from the names
on this list.

32:16.214 --> 32:18.695
Exactly. What I'd
like to drill down on

32:18.902 --> 32:21.862
is this doctor's
personal history.

32:21.950 --> 32:26.556
I can't truly say that I know
many of them all that well.

32:26.644 --> 32:30.868
The man I'm looking for suffered a
disfiguring injury during his adolescence,

32:31.384 --> 32:35.353
an injury that shaped
or you could say misshaped

32:35.610 --> 32:37.306
his sexual development,

32:37.394 --> 32:40.767
but it's also the reason
he became a doctor.

32:40.880 --> 32:44.126
Because perhaps he believed
that one day he might

32:44.214 --> 32:48.431
learn to repair himself?
Am I right?

32:48.735 --> 32:52.804
Yes, but unfortunately
he struggled with his erotic fixations

32:52.892 --> 32:57.071
during the surgeries and was
aroused by all of the cutting

32:57.243 --> 33:01.353
and the manipulating of
the patient's vital organs,

33:01.441 --> 33:03.946
especially their skin.

33:04.252 --> 33:06.767
How would you even
begin to ascertain...

33:06.893 --> 33:10.657
There's be records of formal
reprimands from hospitals

33:10.745 --> 33:15.142
and insurance companies as to why
these surgeries took way too long.

33:16.525 --> 33:18.735
How fascinating.

33:19.764 --> 33:22.457
Your appraisal of this
man's psychopathology is...

33:22.545 --> 33:24.155
My job.

33:25.345 --> 33:27.962
Yes. Of course.

33:29.512 --> 33:31.950
Agent Rossi,
would you excuse me for just a moment?

33:32.038 --> 33:33.704
Absolutely.

33:42.376 --> 33:44.212
There's no sign
of Terrell.

33:45.204 --> 33:47.548
And it's weird because
besides the living room,

33:47.636 --> 33:49.508
it doesn't look like anyone's
actually lived here in weeks.

33:49.595 --> 33:50.972
Well,
according to his assistant,

33:51.059 --> 33:53.279
Terrell left a few
weeks ago on vacation.

33:53.367 --> 33:55.077
That does fit
into the timeline

33:55.165 --> 33:56.377
for the start
of these murders.

34:00.960 --> 34:01.970
Luke.

34:02.058 --> 34:04.321
Hang on a second. You gotta see this.

34:07.124 --> 34:10.780
Son of a bitch insinuated
himself into the investigation.

34:10.906 --> 34:14.518
Emily, our unsub
is Dr. Hurst.

34:36.018 --> 34:37.993
Aah!
Bad move, doc.

34:38.081 --> 34:39.376
Stop, stop. Aah!

34:39.464 --> 34:40.438
You don't attack me,

34:40.527 --> 34:42.978
then I don't have probable
cause to search your place,

34:43.065 --> 34:44.782
and we both know
what I'm gonna find,

34:44.870 --> 34:46.001
now, don't you?

34:46.255 --> 34:47.494
You're breaking my arm!

34:47.581 --> 34:51.010
Yeah, well, a whole lot of cops and
medics are about to bust in here.

34:51.098 --> 34:53.275
So in this precious time
that we have left,

34:53.362 --> 34:57.150
I want to know
where's Everett Lynch.

34:57.352 --> 34:58.627
I don't know what
you're talking...

34:58.714 --> 35:00.860
- Wrong answer.
- Aah! Aah! Aah!

35:00.948 --> 35:04.998
Now, you knew
his mother Roberta.

35:05.086 --> 35:07.867
Hell, you almost married
her to keep up appearances,

35:07.955 --> 35:09.806
but she conned you
out of a lot of money

35:09.894 --> 35:12.115
and you couldn't
go to the cops.

35:12.203 --> 35:13.767
How do you even
know this?

35:13.855 --> 35:17.642
You and little Everett.
I bet you guys got close...

35:17.730 --> 35:20.842
Close enough that
he caught on to your fetish.

35:20.930 --> 35:23.541
And years later,
he came back to help you work it all out.

35:23.629 --> 35:24.675
Why?

35:24.763 --> 35:26.083
Aah! Aah!

35:26.206 --> 35:29.470
What did he want
from you in return?

35:31.647 --> 35:35.261
He wanted...
A good lawyer.

35:43.367 --> 35:44.816
This way.

35:45.384 --> 35:48.122
Hands where I can see
'em, against the wall.

36:03.692 --> 36:05.607
Hands down.

36:05.694 --> 36:08.610
Over here.
Turn around.

36:08.863 --> 36:11.808
Grace, I'm gonna give you all the
time you need with your new lawyer.

36:11.903 --> 36:13.519
You just let me know
when you're ready.

36:13.897 --> 36:15.333
Ok, cool. Thank you.

36:15.445 --> 36:16.925
Right.

36:22.303 --> 36:25.219
What the hell
took you so long?

36:25.627 --> 36:27.152
Better late
than never, right?

36:27.411 --> 36:28.636
You guys good here?

36:28.724 --> 36:30.987
Uh, you know, actually,
marshal there's just

36:31.594 --> 36:32.769
one more thing.

36:32.895 --> 36:35.637
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!

36:45.240 --> 36:46.575
This better be
part of the plan.

36:46.663 --> 36:48.617
Damn straight, darlin'.
Let's go.

36:59.222 --> 37:00.965
Dave, what the
hell is going on?

37:01.059 --> 37:02.557
Look, forget
about Dr. Hurst.

37:02.645 --> 37:03.662
They've got him in custody.

37:03.749 --> 37:06.977
We just need to make sure the U.S.
attorney's office is completely locked down.

37:07.065 --> 37:09.371
You think Lynch is gonna make
an attempt to break Grace out?

37:09.458 --> 37:11.373
Yes. He's disguised
as her new lawyer,

37:11.460 --> 37:13.528
a guy named Arthur Terrell.

37:18.949 --> 37:20.342
There. Take those.

37:22.051 --> 37:24.377
Matt and I were
just at Terrell's house.

37:24.465 --> 37:26.606
We didn't find any connection
to Lynch or his daughter.

37:26.693 --> 37:28.926
Look, I'll explain
everything once we're sure

37:29.014 --> 37:31.582
that Grace is locked down
and Lynch is locked up.

37:31.684 --> 37:33.686
Even though she's being
guarded by U.S. marshals,

37:33.874 --> 37:35.310
if Lynch is
well-disguised,

37:35.397 --> 37:37.269
he'd certainly have the element
of surprise on his side.

37:37.356 --> 37:39.800
He would, but he'd still need
to shoot his way out of that building.

37:39.887 --> 37:42.187
Ok, come on.

37:43.637 --> 37:45.103
<i>Gun!</i>

37:48.802 --> 37:50.804
Here. Take that.

37:51.287 --> 37:53.024
It's ok. Take it.

37:53.256 --> 37:56.027
It's ok. Take it.
Put it in the bag.

37:56.114 --> 37:58.333
<i>10-4. Gunshots fired.</i>

37:58.420 --> 38:00.873
Put on a jacket.

38:00.961 --> 38:03.350
Put all this stuff
in the bag.

38:03.451 --> 38:05.208
If Grace has been
in on this from the start,

38:05.311 --> 38:08.223
then Lynch has had more than
enough time to map an escape route.

38:08.318 --> 38:10.478
 <i>Is that shots
fired? 5th floor, confirm.</i>

38:10.566 --> 38:11.705
Uh,
that's affirmative.

38:11.793 --> 38:14.524
Shots fired. Suspects
Arthur Terrell and Grace Lynch.

38:14.612 --> 38:18.486
In pursuit is hines
and... mccullagh.

38:18.574 --> 38:20.315
Suspects are armed
and dangerous

38:20.573 --> 38:24.055
and currently attempting egress
from Northwestern loading dock.

38:24.310 --> 38:27.622
Over. See? Easy-peasy,
lemon-squeezy.

38:31.429 --> 38:33.379
Hey, I think
it's happening.

38:33.467 --> 38:35.295
There's just been
reports of "shots fired"

38:35.383 --> 38:37.061
at the U.S. attorney's
office.

38:39.983 --> 38:41.855
They're already on
lockdown then.

38:41.942 --> 38:43.561
Penelope, we need to
scramble hrt

38:43.649 --> 38:46.816
and have D.C. Metro police cordon off
a 4-block radius around that building.

38:46.904 --> 38:48.084
On it.

38:52.387 --> 38:53.561
I'm almost there.

38:53.649 --> 38:56.162
Right
behind you, Dave. So are we.

39:03.655 --> 39:06.528
Stop! Drop
the backpack! Now!

39:06.677 --> 39:07.939
Hands where I can see them!

39:16.538 --> 39:18.881
I'm sorry, dad.
For what?

39:19.468 --> 39:22.123
Hey, hey.
Just try to keep up.

39:22.211 --> 39:23.647
Trust me.

39:32.210 --> 39:33.733
They think Lynch
has a radio.

39:33.820 --> 39:35.890
So he could still be inside
trying to confuse us tactically.

39:35.977 --> 39:37.519
Yeah, damn it.
Where the hell is everybody?

39:37.606 --> 39:39.428
All right,
we're going in.

39:40.594 --> 39:41.467
Dave.

39:41.555 --> 39:44.209
Lynch has compromised
our tactical communication.

39:44.309 --> 39:49.363
Hrt isn't here, and Metro hasn't shut down
one damn street around this building yet.

39:49.451 --> 39:51.451
This is crazy. Everyone's getting
caught with their pants down.

39:51.539 --> 39:53.630
Hey, I'm getting a
report that Lynch and Grace

39:53.717 --> 39:54.841
were seen going underground,
like way underground,

39:54.928 --> 39:56.277
the underground
parking levels.

39:56.364 --> 39:58.366
That's good, right?
They'll trap themselves in there.

39:58.453 --> 40:01.631
The bottom parking level connects
to the underground garages

40:01.719 --> 40:04.505
for both the first monument bank
and the D.C. trade Plaza.

40:04.593 --> 40:06.973
Gives them escape routes
in multiple directions

40:07.061 --> 40:08.396
extending beyond
our roadblocks.

40:08.561 --> 40:09.990
Tell Reid and JJ
what's going on.

40:10.078 --> 40:12.470
They may now be in the best
position to cut Lynch and Grace off.

40:20.345 --> 40:22.444
All right, we can't wait for backup.
I'll cover this one.

40:22.531 --> 40:24.491
I'll take the parking garage
at piedmont and 10th.

40:41.931 --> 40:44.412
Everett Lynch, FBI! Stop!

40:45.861 --> 40:49.303
Drop your weapon and place
your hands on your head.

40:49.481 --> 40:50.569
Now!

40:50.657 --> 40:52.702
Ok! Hey!

40:52.942 --> 40:54.814
Take it easy.

40:55.092 --> 40:57.295
Gee, lady, there's no
reason to gun down a daddy

40:57.382 --> 40:59.035
in front of
his little girl.

40:59.122 --> 41:01.212
Right?

41:01.405 --> 41:03.605
All right,
kick it over.

41:03.692 --> 41:05.303
Kick it over!

41:09.307 --> 41:11.069
All right, Grace,
you, too. Come on.

41:11.309 --> 41:13.889
Drop your backpack
and let me see your hands.

41:14.671 --> 41:15.977
Come on!

41:16.314 --> 41:17.514
Now!

41:22.450 --> 41:23.625
All right.

41:23.923 --> 41:25.664
Don't move.

41:42.164 --> 41:44.776
Aah! Uhh!

41:44.864 --> 41:46.953
Aah!

41:57.068 --> 41:58.303
Ha!

42:01.179 --> 42:02.571
Ha ha!

42:06.215 --> 42:07.825
Ha ha ha!
