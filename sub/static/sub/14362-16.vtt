Nobody gets us like he does.

00:34.747 --> 00:35.754
As you know,
I've spent the last few months

00:35.874 --> 00:38.100
roving the Great Plains
with my new seminar

00:38.222 --> 00:40.690
"Teens 'n Screens,
What Would Jesus Tweet?"

00:41.803 --> 00:43.135
Well, my travels took me

00:43.257 --> 00:46.428
to the upper Peninsula
of Michigan,

00:46.496 --> 00:47.846
where I crossed paths
with somebody

00:47.939 --> 00:51.062
I think is pretty great,
and I'm guessing you will, too.

00:51.176 --> 00:53.041
So, everybody give it up

00:53.231 --> 00:56.746

Dude.

01:36.966 --> 01:38.546
This is the fifth time
you checked your phone.

01:38.629 --> 01:40.940
Sorry. Thought I might hear
from Cassidy.

01:41.147 --> 01:42.808
Think she came back into town
yesterday.

01:42.915 --> 01:44.367
Ahh.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.814
Get a little spring break
reunion?

01:46.898 --> 01:48.725
Is Axsidy back in business?

01:48.814 --> 01:51.760
First of all, it was "Caxl,"
and, no, I haven't seen her.

01:51.848 --> 01:54.015
I mean, we've been talking
and texting and stuff,

01:54.117 --> 01:56.387
and I told her I'd be home
and she told me she'd be home,

01:56.461 --> 01:57.785
but we didn't set anything up.

01:57.866 --> 01:59.182
Only one way
to set something up.

01:59.276 --> 02:00.362
You got to make the move.

02:00.468 --> 02:01.915
I don't want to look needy.

02:02.027 --> 02:03.217
But you <i> are</i> really needy.

02:03.309 --> 02:05.099
This is true.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.271
Yep.

02:08.470 --> 02:09.564
Hi, Axl.

02:09.713 --> 02:13.110
Hey!
Cassidy, what's up?

02:13.223 --> 02:15.778
Oh, not much.
What are you doing?

02:15.908 --> 02:16.762
Nothing.

02:16.873 --> 02:19.044
Me and Sean are just
playing around on my bed.

02:19.242 --> 02:20.555
That didn't sound right.
Never mind.

02:20.649 --> 02:22.517
Uh, hey, so if you're around,

02:22.605 --> 02:24.729
you want to maybe, uh,
get together or something?

02:24.961 --> 02:25.948
That could work.

02:26.045 --> 02:27.367
How about later
I swing by your house?

02:27.460 --> 02:28.490
Yeah, I'll see you soon.

02:28.612 --> 02:30.366
Sean and I just got to
hop in the shower.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.934
Uh, separately.
Very separately.

02:33.017 --> 02:35.875
I'll... just, uh, I'll see you later.

02:35.963 --> 02:37.043
Uh...

02:44.221 --> 02:44.814
Hey!

02:44.903 --> 02:45.686
Hey.

02:48.548 --> 02:50.697
So, uh, wow.

02:50.917 --> 02:52.263
Great to see you.

02:52.571 --> 02:54.696
How's, uh, it going?

02:54.778 --> 02:57.227
You enjoying
your art history and stuff?

02:57.412 --> 02:58.961
Yeah, I really am.

02:59.052 --> 03:01.838
How about you? You enjoying
your football and stuff?

03:01.964 --> 03:03.836
It's good. Yeah.

03:04.180 --> 03:05.489
Really good.

03:05.689 --> 03:07.739
Yeah.

03:08.254 --> 03:09.553
Really good.

03:14.818 --> 03:17.005
Whose brilliant idea was it
to cook in here?

03:17.179 --> 03:19.342
There's burnt cheese
all over the quilt.

03:22.114 --> 03:23.616
Brick, could you...

03:25.111 --> 03:26.171
Forget it.

03:30.174 --> 03:31.688
Frances Heck?

03:31.977 --> 03:32.780
Uh-huh.

03:32.869 --> 03:34.733
Mrs. Heck, we have a warrant
for your arrest.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.791
My arrest? What?!

03:36.870 --> 03:37.737
Are you kidding?

03:37.836 --> 03:39.211
Everybody always thinks
we're kidding.

03:39.435 --> 03:40.268
We're not kidding.

03:40.358 --> 03:41.824
If you could please place
your hands behind your back--

03:41.909 --> 03:43.865
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
What's happening here?

03:43.945 --> 03:46.499
This is obviously
a huge mistake.

03:46.570 --> 03:48.217
What am I being arrested for?

03:48.317 --> 03:49.998
Ma'am, they'll explain
the charges down at the station.

03:50.108 --> 03:51.549
You have the right
to remain silent.

03:51.629 --> 03:53.090
Wait, wait, this is for real?

03:53.167 --> 03:54.127
Anything you say
can and will be used against you

03:54.190 --> 03:55.255
- in a court of law.
- This is serious?

03:55.340 --> 03:56.542
Ow! Ah!

03:56.614 --> 03:57.875
I have
rotator-cuff issues.

03:57.986 --> 03:59.856
They say it's from sleeping
with my hands over my head.

03:59.980 --> 04:00.689
You know, I tried,

04:00.773 --> 04:03.125
but I can't fall asleep
any other way, and-- aah!

04:03.400 --> 04:05.884
Brick!
Tell your dad what happened!

04:05.960 --> 04:07.103
Okay.

04:07.226 --> 04:09.454
Oh, and if you're going out,
get cereal.

04:11.000 --> 04:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:18.567 --> 04:20.843
I mean this is ridiculous.

04:20.940 --> 04:24.192
How is there an outstanding
warrant for my arrest?

04:24.333 --> 04:26.903
But for what?
I didn't get a summons.

04:27.022 --> 04:28.327
There's got to be some mistake.

04:28.450 --> 04:29.063
No.

04:29.150 --> 04:30.486
Looks like the exact charge

04:30.574 --> 04:32.929
is failure to return
library materials.

04:33.049 --> 04:34.875
Brick.

04:35.099 --> 04:36.795
Are you kidding?

04:37.099 --> 04:39.812
You're seriously arresting me
for an overdue library book?

04:39.898 --> 04:40.547
Mm-hmm.

04:40.632 --> 04:41.824
That's what happens
when you ignore three letters

04:41.927 --> 04:43.481
and two summons.

04:43.634 --> 04:45.685
We aren't good
at going through the mail.

04:45.815 --> 04:47.942
I tell everybody
we need a system,

04:48.058 --> 04:49.950
but then nobody obeys
the system.

04:50.100 --> 04:53.420
Look, we must not have realized
it was an official summons.

04:53.536 --> 04:55.978
I probably thought it was one
of those appliance-store coupons

04:56.105 --> 04:58.642
"summoning" me
to low, low prices.

04:58.755 --> 04:59.700
Ma'am, when you make bail,

04:59.786 --> 05:01.785
you'll have a chance to tell
your whole story to the judge.

05:02.481 --> 05:04.252
But I'd streamline it a little.

05:04.344 --> 05:06.313
I need bail now?
Are you kidding me?

05:06.428 --> 05:09.736
Once again, ma'am, I can assure
you we are never kidding.

05:09.831 --> 05:11.742
Would you, uh, please step over
to that X on the floor?

05:16.084 --> 05:17.398
Might want to take
an extra one of those,

05:17.493 --> 05:20.002
because as soon as I get home,
I'm gonna kill my son!

05:22.095 --> 05:24.597
It was supposed to be
a jubilation celebration,

05:24.710 --> 05:26.881
but with this Reverend Tammy
person, I'm just saying,

05:26.999 --> 05:30.069
her voice--
extremely grating.

05:30.180 --> 05:32.380
And her smile--
I wish you could've seen it.

05:32.509 --> 05:34.616
It was so fake.

05:35.267 --> 05:36.641
Hey.

05:37.424 --> 05:39.101
You were out with Cassidy
pretty late last night.

05:39.350 --> 05:40.945
What time did you end up
getting home?

05:41.058 --> 05:42.631
I don't know.
Why do you care so much?

05:42.712 --> 05:44.596
When I'm at school, you don't
know what time I'm out.

05:44.708 --> 05:46.266
I don't care. Just if you
were dead in a ditch,

05:46.367 --> 05:48.244
I'd have ordered
a medium pizza.

05:48.378 --> 05:50.219
Hey, Frankie,
we got Shorty's pizza!

05:50.324 --> 05:51.444
It's getting cold!

05:51.555 --> 05:53.637
She was definitely
trying too hard.

05:53.765 --> 05:55.251
Felt like she was
saying the words

05:55.377 --> 05:57.110
but not really meaning it.

05:57.223 --> 05:59.337
She was like a spiritual shrug.

05:59.483 --> 06:00.950
And, like,
people were clapping,

06:01.076 --> 06:03.047
but I think it was
just to be polite.

06:06.453 --> 06:07.876
Oh, right.

06:08.013 --> 06:10.615
I was supposed to tell you--
mom got arrested.

06:10.701 --> 06:11.738
- What?!
- What are you talking about?

06:11.825 --> 06:14.006
Yeah, that's right.
I got arrested.

06:14.102 --> 06:15.846
And you know why
I got arrested?

06:15.956 --> 06:18.711
Because apparently, someone's
been using my library card

06:18.808 --> 06:19.786
without me knowing

06:19.880 --> 06:22.863
and checking out books
and not returning them.

06:22.944 --> 06:24.081
Based on the way
you're looking at me,

06:24.170 --> 06:25.366
I'm assuming you think I know,

06:25.450 --> 06:27.957
but honestly, I have no idea
who it could be.

06:28.078 --> 06:30.372
It's you, Brick. I do know.
It's you.

06:30.451 --> 06:33.538
Wait, they're arresting people
for overdue library books now?

06:33.629 --> 06:34.578
That's ridiculous.

06:34.687 --> 06:36.130
You know
what I find ridiculous?

06:36.248 --> 06:39.588
You all sitting here eating
dinner while I rot in jail!

06:39.668 --> 06:41.316
So, mom went to the slammer.

06:41.388 --> 06:43.194
You all thought it'd be me
first, but it was mom.

06:43.294 --> 06:44.266
It's hilarious.

06:44.453 --> 06:47.222
Yes. It is hilarious.

06:47.368 --> 06:49.861
I don't know which part
was the most hilarious.

06:49.964 --> 06:51.737
Maybe when they
fingerprinted me,

06:51.852 --> 06:53.714
or maybe when they
took my mug shot,

06:53.800 --> 06:55.436
or maybe it was all those hours

06:55.610 --> 06:57.428
spent sitting
on a very cold bench

06:57.523 --> 07:00.052
waiting for my family
to come and pick me up,

07:00.135 --> 07:01.984
'cause there's no way
they could possibly be

07:02.119 --> 07:04.495
sitting around the kitchen
table, scarfing pizza,

07:04.598 --> 07:07.069
forgetting they even have
a mother!

07:07.244 --> 07:08.531
- My phone's on vibrate.
- I'm so sorry!

07:08.623 --> 07:09.335
Battery's dead.

07:09.422 --> 07:10.660
Hey, whatever happened
to my phone?

07:10.746 --> 07:14.007
Oh, mom, I am so, so sorry.

07:14.157 --> 07:16.318
I'd have been down there
in a second if I knew.

07:16.429 --> 07:17.716
Oh,
and guess what else--

07:17.845 --> 07:19.567
Reverend Timtom
has this new singing partner,

07:19.671 --> 07:22.296
Reverend Tammy,
who is so not good.

07:22.396 --> 07:23.709
And, I mean, everybody noticed.

07:23.812 --> 07:24.923
I think I'm gonna have to
say something to him

07:25.018 --> 07:26.528
so he knows how the teens
are reacting to this.

07:26.606 --> 07:27.832
Sue.

07:28.482 --> 07:29.836
Long day.

07:30.152 --> 07:31.188
Now, if you'll excuse me,

07:31.281 --> 07:34.090
I'm gonna go wash
the jail off of me.

07:34.486 --> 07:35.880
Enjoy your pizza.

07:41.961 --> 07:43.484
Oh, hey, there, Sue Heck.

07:43.653 --> 07:44.974
Hey, Reverend Timtom.

07:45.104 --> 07:47.860
Hey, listen, do you think
I could have a word with you?

07:47.980 --> 07:48.971
Well, sure thing.

07:49.056 --> 07:50.512
You know I always have time
for you.

07:50.640 --> 07:52.177
Just not a ton of time.

07:52.294 --> 07:56.243
I'm running to a praise n' putt
mini-golf fundraiser, but shoot.

07:56.367 --> 07:58.770
Okay, ever since
the jubilation celebration,

07:58.894 --> 08:00.258
I've been kind of worried,

08:00.365 --> 08:02.663
'cause it just seems like why
would you change something

08:02.774 --> 08:04.158
that's already working,

08:04.292 --> 08:06.588
'cause I think teens count
on a certain kind of consistency

08:06.708 --> 08:09.380
'cause we have stuff getting
thrown at us every day.

08:09.490 --> 08:11.110
Like last night,
my mom got--

08:11.198 --> 08:14.821
You know, if this is about
moms and teens, you are in luck,

08:14.927 --> 08:17.823
because Reverend Tammy
happens to be an expert.

08:17.948 --> 08:19.630
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.
That's okay.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.036
- Reverend Tammy?
- No, no, no.

08:21.153 --> 08:23.223
Really, honestly, Reverend Timtom,
we can just do it another time.

08:23.328 --> 08:27.147
Tammy, would you mind rapping
with my pal, Sue Heck, here?

08:27.344 --> 08:29.901
Happy to lend an ear.
Hi, Sue Heck.

08:30.006 --> 08:31.506
Timothy's told me
all about you.

08:31.617 --> 08:33.631
Now, I'm gonna let you two
pow-wow.

08:33.740 --> 08:35.028
You're in good hands, Sue Heck.

08:35.118 --> 08:36.023
Aww.

08:36.135 --> 08:37.772
And you,
I'll pick you up later.

08:37.852 --> 08:38.839
Bye, babe.

08:46.934 --> 08:49.948
Okay, the librarian said it's
just one book that's overdue,

08:50.052 --> 08:52.260
and it's called
"Stormy Moon."

08:53.212 --> 08:55.001
"Stormy Moon"?

08:55.113 --> 08:56.853
"Stormy Moon."

08:57.388 --> 08:58.452
Does not ring a bell.

08:58.560 --> 09:00.228
Come on, it's about a moon.

09:00.391 --> 09:02.665
Sounds kind of science-fictiony,
right?

09:02.751 --> 09:04.542
Maybe it's in there with all
your "Planet Nowhere" books.

09:04.656 --> 09:06.664
Oh, yeah!
That's a good idea.

09:06.774 --> 09:08.227
You should go look in my room.

09:08.306 --> 09:09.843
I am not hauling my butt
to court

09:09.932 --> 09:12.318
to pay some 180-buck fine
for a stupid book

09:12.409 --> 09:14.029
that you're too lazy
to look for.

09:14.132 --> 09:16.431
Now, stop screwing around
and find it.

09:16.612 --> 09:18.625
You do not want to mess with me.

09:18.716 --> 09:21.336
I already have a record, people.
I got nothing to lose.

09:23.213 --> 09:24.033
Wow.

09:24.119 --> 09:25.541
Your mom got arrested.

09:25.687 --> 09:28.154
I can see how you might be
feeling upset.

09:28.253 --> 09:29.678
No, that's not really it.

09:29.791 --> 09:30.644
Well, maybe you're
just concerned

09:30.720 --> 09:31.995
about how your mom's feeling
right now.

09:32.071 --> 09:33.489
No, no, not really.

09:33.597 --> 09:34.998
No, that's not...

09:35.476 --> 09:37.744
Okay, fine. Whatever.

09:37.830 --> 09:40.150
Look, Sue,
at my sleepover jams,

09:40.262 --> 09:41.737
after we have savior s'mores,

09:41.847 --> 09:43.602
I get to rap
with a lot of girls

09:43.703 --> 09:46.119
that are in the exact same
position as you.

09:46.232 --> 09:47.743
And it's a really hard age,

09:47.850 --> 09:51.960
because there's so much changing
in your bodies and at school.

09:52.040 --> 09:53.975
Wrong.
Wrong again.

09:54.104 --> 09:56.353
I think maybe you should just
lay it out there and--

09:56.472 --> 09:58.892
and try talking to your mom
about how you feel.

09:58.991 --> 10:01.493
Do you? Do you think
that's what I should do?

10:01.600 --> 10:04.119
Maybe if you knew me
for longer than a day,

10:04.191 --> 10:06.501
you'd know that that is actually
the exact opposite

10:06.594 --> 10:07.629
of what I should do.

10:07.726 --> 10:08.932
Because, you see,
that's sort of a piece

10:09.017 --> 10:11.505
of, like, general advice
for general teens,

10:11.587 --> 10:14.993
but it's not really very
Sue specific.

10:16.116 --> 10:19.340
Um, maybe I could better express
myself through a song.

10:21.370 --> 10:22.600
Let's see.

10:22.815 --> 10:27.084
♪ Mary had one son
born on Christmas day ♪

10:27.173 --> 10:29.402
♪ she was hoping
for a daughter ♪

10:29.541 --> 10:31.271
But she didn't have much say.

10:31.412 --> 10:32.941
All right!
I'm gonna stop you right there.

10:33.562 --> 10:37.088
I'm sorry, but singing advice
doesn't really work for me.

10:37.188 --> 10:40.080
I'm just not the kind of person
who responds to singing

10:40.211 --> 10:42.512
as a way of solving
your problems.

10:42.598 --> 10:44.456
So, yeah.

10:54.412 --> 10:56.222
Okay, everybody up.

10:56.377 --> 10:58.006
Ooh! Oh.

10:58.075 --> 11:01.433
We are looking for a book called
"Stormy Moon" by PJ Wilcox,

11:01.519 --> 11:03.662
and we are not doing
anything else ever again

11:03.756 --> 11:06.397
until we find it, because I am
not going back in the slammer.

11:06.488 --> 11:07.345
- Now?
- But I already looked.

11:07.440 --> 11:08.971
But Orson is having
a teen crisis.

11:09.024 --> 11:10.509
I just found the sun beam.

11:10.646 --> 11:12.122
You know, on "The Brady Bunch,"

11:12.227 --> 11:13.854
when they said they were
going to do something,

11:13.948 --> 11:15.740
they all pitched in and did it.

11:15.825 --> 11:17.959
The level of group determination
in that family

11:18.040 --> 11:20.044
was just off the charts.

11:20.181 --> 11:22.462
Here it's every man
for himself.

11:22.555 --> 11:26.348
Well, we are gonna Brady
this situation right now.

11:28.892 --> 11:31.217
So, there's, uh,
been a lot of late nights

11:31.302 --> 11:32.587
with Cassidy, huh?

11:32.673 --> 11:34.344
Yeah, I guess.

11:34.531 --> 11:35.668
How's that going?

11:35.820 --> 11:38.192
Fine.
We're just having fun.

11:38.363 --> 11:39.379
All right.

11:39.482 --> 11:42.548
But the only thing is,
we've been having so much fun,

11:42.639 --> 11:46.355
that we haven't really had
any time to, you know, talk.

11:46.446 --> 11:48.107
And the problem here is what?

11:48.335 --> 11:50.012
Well, she's going back
to New York tomorrow.

11:50.112 --> 11:51.876
I don't know if she wants
to keep in touch

11:51.952 --> 11:53.924
and be, like, a thing,
or if she's more, "That was fun.

11:54.026 --> 11:55.018
Have a nice life."

11:55.116 --> 11:56.215
I just don't know
what she's thinking.

11:56.293 --> 11:57.805
Who knows
what anybody's thinking?

11:58.093 --> 12:00.008
Hell, I don't know
if your mom still likes me.

12:00.115 --> 12:01.503
- Found it!
- Yes!

12:01.605 --> 12:02.628
Guys, he's got it.

12:02.724 --> 12:03.622
Brick found the book.

12:03.713 --> 12:04.607
Oh, not the book.

12:04.697 --> 12:07.330
I found these coupons
for half off at The Pie House.

12:07.470 --> 12:10.167
Brick, look at my face.

12:10.262 --> 12:13.243
Do you have any sense
of how angry I am right now?

12:13.698 --> 12:15.418
Nothing pie wouldn't fix.

12:15.672 --> 12:16.579
I will kill you.

12:16.679 --> 12:17.989
Okay, uh, no offense, mom,

12:18.099 --> 12:21.978
but Orson is losing its
number-one Christian role model,

12:22.075 --> 12:24.074
and all you can think about
is a dumb book.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.662
You have a dad, too.

12:25.741 --> 12:27.570
Why don't you tell him
about any of this stuff?

12:27.687 --> 12:30.633
It wouldn't kill him to listen
every once in a while, Mike.

12:30.719 --> 12:32.184
Hey, I listen plenty,

12:32.291 --> 12:33.883
but there's only so many hours
in the day,

12:33.990 --> 12:35.510
and I got to spend
most of them at work

12:35.610 --> 12:39.063
so I can pay off things like
overdue library books, Brick.

12:39.171 --> 12:40.471
It's not my fault
I can't find the book.

12:40.551 --> 12:42.866
I live with the messiest person
ever, Axl.

12:42.958 --> 12:44.196
Hey, if I'm messy,

12:44.316 --> 12:46.227
it's 'cause I'm crammed
into half a room

12:46.318 --> 12:47.536
instead of having my own room

12:47.633 --> 12:49.259
in a mansion
that we can't afford

12:49.372 --> 12:51.488
'cause they put all our money
into Sue's mouth!

12:51.587 --> 12:53.889
Oh! And why do you think
I need braces, Axl?

12:54.008 --> 12:55.745
It is because you
drank all the milk

12:55.851 --> 12:56.833
that I was supposed to get

12:56.927 --> 12:58.753
to make my teeth
strong and healthy.

12:58.870 --> 13:00.267
I never got one sip!

13:00.370 --> 13:02.015
You just drained mom dry.

13:02.123 --> 13:03.700
That is why I have
uncorrectable teeth

13:03.799 --> 13:05.518
and Brick is a foot shorter
than he should be.

13:05.617 --> 13:07.315
No! No! No!
D-d-don't blame that on me.

13:07.429 --> 13:10.481
He's short 'cause he's hunched
over a book all the time!

13:10.596 --> 13:12.501
That's why all of his growth
spurts are all this way.

13:12.669 --> 13:14.888
He keeps going,
he's gonna be an O.

13:14.973 --> 13:15.947
Maybe I read all the time

13:16.049 --> 13:17.562
'cause dad never took
an interest in me.

13:17.681 --> 13:19.807
He's too busy
coddling the milk hoarder.

13:19.907 --> 13:22.224
You know what?
This is very un-Brady.

13:22.350 --> 13:24.297
Blaming each other
isn't getting us anywhere,

13:24.393 --> 13:25.569
so if we can't find the book,

13:25.676 --> 13:27.290
we'll just have to
take Brick down there

13:27.372 --> 13:30.144
and throw ourselves
on the mercy of the court.

13:30.357 --> 13:32.025
That--
that's a thing, right?

13:34.683 --> 13:38.126
<i>Meanwhile, Sue was preparing</i>
<i>to make a case of her own.</i>

13:38.717 --> 13:41.350
Yeah, I know how you feel,
you know how I feel.

13:41.455 --> 13:43.384
We've talked it to death.
Let's just leave it.

13:43.484 --> 13:45.378
No, that's what you always
want to do.

13:45.479 --> 13:46.572
You just shut down.

13:46.678 --> 13:47.443
I'm not shutting down.

13:47.524 --> 13:49.111
We've been discussing it
for an hour.

13:49.233 --> 13:51.573
Well, I'm sorry that I've wasted
all your time

13:51.664 --> 13:54.071
with something as trivial
as my feelings.

13:54.207 --> 13:56.752
Well, don't worry.
I won't bother you anymore.

14:02.959 --> 14:04.201
Hello?

14:05.083 --> 14:06.805
Hey, Reverend Timtom.

14:06.936 --> 14:08.422
Hey, Sue Heck.

14:08.555 --> 14:10.093
Something I can help you with?

14:10.216 --> 14:11.314
Oh, no.

14:11.429 --> 14:14.248
Uh, I-I was gonna talk to you
about something,

14:14.347 --> 14:15.254
but it's all right.

14:15.386 --> 14:16.486
I'm good now.

14:16.771 --> 14:17.765
Come on.

14:18.703 --> 14:20.233
Pull up a chair.
I insist.

14:28.400 --> 14:29.432
Sorry.

14:29.523 --> 14:31.182
Uh, rough day.

14:31.627 --> 14:33.068
So, what's on your mind?

14:33.935 --> 14:36.572
Well, I guess you could say

14:36.666 --> 14:40.013
I have
a big problem with--

14:40.126 --> 14:41.729
Ugh, what am I doing?

14:41.828 --> 14:44.589
No, I came here to say
bad things about Reverend Tammy,

14:44.689 --> 14:47.083
and that is so mean of me.

14:47.240 --> 14:49.957
Her teen advice was spot on,

14:50.054 --> 14:51.852
and I just threw it
back in her face.

14:52.042 --> 14:53.219
Oh, Sue.

14:53.931 --> 14:55.576
Don't be so hard on yourself.

14:55.676 --> 14:58.224
Feelings are complicated.

14:58.311 --> 14:59.721
But I was praying
you two would have a fight

14:59.811 --> 15:01.527
and that she would slink back
to Grand Rapids,

15:01.625 --> 15:02.836
and now you two
have had a fight,

15:02.928 --> 15:04.866
and you seem really upset.

15:04.943 --> 15:06.939
So, I take it you overheard
our little tiff?

15:07.037 --> 15:08.127
No, no.

15:08.713 --> 15:10.027
Yes.

15:11.340 --> 15:14.043
Sue, let me give you
some advice.

15:14.123 --> 15:15.057
No! Don't.

15:15.156 --> 15:16.973
I really, really,
really want it,

15:17.083 --> 15:18.411
but I don't deserve it.

15:18.551 --> 15:21.139
I have been so selfish.

15:21.237 --> 15:23.400
If you were happy,
I should be happy for you.

15:23.526 --> 15:26.622
Now you're unhappy,
and it makes me unhappy.

15:26.751 --> 15:28.212
I am doubly unhappy.

15:28.350 --> 15:29.319
Oh, but I feel bad

15:29.416 --> 15:31.444
'cause I don't want to make it
about me being unhappy.

15:31.547 --> 15:33.081
Oh, Sue, don't you understand?

15:33.199 --> 15:36.070
Making you feel better
makes me feel better.

15:36.144 --> 15:38.282
It's what I do.
It's how I roll.

15:38.402 --> 15:39.789
And the fact
that you're unhappy,

15:39.925 --> 15:42.656
that proves that you're not
selfish at all.

Case 1492B,

16:31.580 --> 16:33.755
the city of Orson
versus Frances Heck

16:33.898 --> 16:36.170
in the matter
of unpaid library fees,

16:36.286 --> 16:39.707
avoiding a summons,
and failure to appear.

16:39.924 --> 16:41.079
Frances Heck, present.

16:41.166 --> 16:42.591
Hi. I've appeared.

16:42.697 --> 16:45.274
Mrs. Heck, this court recommends
that you plead no contest

16:45.390 --> 16:48.025
and pay the $180 fine,

16:48.122 --> 16:50.937
and then we can all get on
with this glorious day.

16:51.026 --> 16:52.157
Okay, all that sounds good.

16:52.256 --> 16:56.119
The thing is,
we don't have the $180.

16:56.220 --> 16:57.486
This is what happened.

16:57.630 --> 17:00.361
My son here loves to read
so much

17:00.492 --> 17:02.051
that when he lost
his library card,

17:02.149 --> 17:03.917
he borrowed mine
to check out books,

17:04.005 --> 17:05.939
and then he happened to misplace
one of them.

17:06.050 --> 17:08.960
Was it irresponsible of him
to lose that book? Yes.

17:09.064 --> 17:11.101
But books are his only friends.

17:11.209 --> 17:12.232
Tell him, Brick.

17:12.345 --> 17:14.141
Well, I have made
a few new friends.

17:14.251 --> 17:15.560
I mean, they don't invite me
to do stuff,

17:15.655 --> 17:17.820
but I stand near them and they
don't ask me to go away.

17:19.352 --> 17:22.561
The point is, Brick has
absolutely learned his lesson.

17:22.685 --> 17:24.020
Brick,
did you learn your lesson?

17:24.119 --> 17:25.613
Oh,
I-I definitely did.

17:25.736 --> 17:27.965
Also, I learned that if my mom
ever goes to jail again,

17:28.071 --> 17:29.488
I will tell my dad.

17:29.572 --> 17:32.013
All due respect, Judge, is this
really what we're doing now?

17:32.161 --> 17:33.873
I mean, my wife was handcuffed

17:33.983 --> 17:35.178
and dragged down
to the police station

17:35.295 --> 17:36.824
all because of a library book?

17:36.996 --> 17:41.344
Mr. Heck, I judge the cases
that are put before me.

17:41.418 --> 17:44.544
I don't get to pick the ones
that light my fire.

17:44.623 --> 17:47.430
No, I'm sorry,
but my husband is right.

17:47.536 --> 17:50.496
Do you know about all
the break-ins at Joe's Subs?

17:50.586 --> 17:52.792
There are real crimes
out there.

17:52.922 --> 17:53.912
Real crimes.

17:54.014 --> 17:56.532
Do we even know
what happened to this book?

17:56.624 --> 17:57.979
It's not in our house.

17:58.078 --> 17:59.101
It could've been stolen.

17:59.213 --> 18:02.645
My point is the police should be
focusing on real crime

18:02.751 --> 18:04.249
and not be worrying about
some kid's book

18:04.325 --> 18:07.514
that none of us can even
remember what it's about.

18:07.647 --> 18:09.952
It says here
it's "Stormy Moon,"

18:10.082 --> 18:12.281
$14.99
from Letter House Books.

18:12.411 --> 18:16.525
"The tantalizing tale
of a handsome drifter

18:16.621 --> 18:22.137
who awakens the sensual desires
of a lonely housewife.

18:22.449 --> 18:27.363
Stormy never dreamed
when Lorenzo rebuilt her gazebo,

18:27.522 --> 18:31.151
he would also re-ignite
her passion."

18:33.270 --> 18:34.953
Okay, I'll write you a check.

18:35.050 --> 18:36.685
Could you just wait
a couple weeks to cash it?

18:38.888 --> 18:40.110
Next case.

18:51.606 --> 18:53.466
Well,
good-byes pretty much suck,

18:53.568 --> 18:56.640
so how about we just say
"So long"?

18:56.752 --> 18:57.310
I don't know.

18:57.419 --> 19:00.435
I've always been more
of a "Happy trails" guy, myself.

19:06.795 --> 19:10.490
So, uh, we never really did
get around to talking.

19:10.928 --> 19:13.546
Yeah, we haven't exactly
done that, have we?

19:13.710 --> 19:15.071
No.

19:15.497 --> 19:16.812
We really haven't.

19:17.029 --> 19:19.663
But I have a surprise for you.

19:19.745 --> 19:21.424
I painted you something,

19:21.755 --> 19:24.179
'cause sometimes
it's easier than talking.

19:24.363 --> 19:27.163
And it kind of says everything
about how I feel.

19:27.385 --> 19:28.578
Really?

19:32.843 --> 19:35.394
Oh, wow.

19:35.758 --> 19:37.138
I know art's not your thing,

19:37.258 --> 19:39.121
but I kind of feel like
I captured it.

19:39.287 --> 19:41.024
I mean, this is us.

19:41.254 --> 19:42.999
Yeah.

19:43.092 --> 19:44.238
Obviously, you nailed it.

19:44.385 --> 19:45.585
Totally us.

19:45.714 --> 19:46.967
You get it?

19:47.066 --> 19:48.563
I didn't know if you'd get it.

19:48.657 --> 19:49.703
Of course I do.

19:49.827 --> 19:52.944
It's all there...
in this painting right here.

19:53.033 --> 19:54.763
Oh!

19:54.885 --> 19:55.958
Wow.

20:02.110 --> 20:03.345
Okay, then.

20:03.448 --> 20:05.744
Well, happy trails.

20:06.089 --> 20:07.614
So long.

20:27.390 --> 20:28.445
Oh, come on.

20:28.572 --> 20:30.890
Did you seriously just check out
another library book?

20:31.119 --> 20:32.381
In fact, I did.

20:33.535 --> 20:35.408
I found a copy
in the Jasper County branch.

20:35.509 --> 20:37.815
I have to say, when the judge
read that plot summary,

20:37.896 --> 20:39.375
it really piqued my interest.

20:39.457 --> 20:41.799
Turns out
it's a real page turner.

20:43.941 --> 20:47.338
<i>The time had come</i>
<i>for Lorenzo to drift again.</i>

20:47.498 --> 20:49.803
<i>He would forever remain</i>
<i>a beautiful mystery.</i>

20:49.897 --> 20:51.049
What does this mean?

20:51.115 --> 20:52.519
Am I the fish or the crown,

20:52.597 --> 20:53.801
and what about
that green thing?

20:53.877 --> 20:55.009
What even is that green thing?

20:55.097 --> 20:56.996
I got no idea
what I'm looking at.

20:57.370 --> 20:58.724
Seems like you guys
could've talked about things

20:58.800 --> 21:00.915
in the time it took her
to paint this.

21:07.209 --> 21:09.682
<i>She knew she would miss</i>
<i>his stolen kisses,</i>

21:09.820 --> 21:11.802
<i>but would always treasure</i>
<i>the happiness</i>

21:11.882 --> 21:14.010
<i>he helped her feel inside.</i>

21:14.350 --> 21:17.895
<i>But sadly, what is borrowed</i>
<i>must always be returned,</i>

21:18.018 --> 21:21.324
<i>and there is always a price</i>
<i>to pay in the end.</i>

21:21.437 --> 21:24.264
Oh, snap!
She jumped off a cliff.

21:24.543 --> 21:27.094
Did not see that coming.
