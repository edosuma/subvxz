WEBVTT

00:08.049 --> 00:09.679
"MELISSA AND JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.680 --> 00:11.181
CARRIE, CALM DOWN.

00:11.182 --> 00:13.012
TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.844
LOOK, OKAY. YOU'RE THE BRIDE.

00:14.845 --> 00:17.137
NO, YOU'RE NOT
OVERREACTING AT ALL.

00:17.138 --> 00:18.898
SHE IS TOTALLY CRAY-CRAY.

00:18.899 --> 00:21.271
OKAY, LOOK. WE'RE JUST
GONNA ASK YOUR SISTER

00:21.272 --> 00:22.732
TO WEAR A BIGGER CORSAGE.

00:22.733 --> 00:24.944
THAT WILL COVER THE BLEEDING-SKULL
TATTOO ON HER CHEST.

00:24.945 --> 00:27.947
OKAY? EVERYTHING'S GONNA GO
EXACTLY AS WE PLANNED IT.

00:27.948 --> 00:30.740
OKAY? OKAY. ALL RIGHT. BYE-BYE.

00:30.741 --> 00:32.742
- ( phone beeps )
- WOW.

00:32.743 --> 00:35.325
- CUCKOO.
- WHY IS SHE OVERREACTING SO MUCH?

00:35.326 --> 00:37.077
I THOUGHT EVERYTHING
WAS ALL ARRANGED.

00:37.078 --> 00:40.080
YES, BY ME. CARRIE DIDN'T KNOW A
THING ABOUT PLANNING A WEDDING,

00:40.081 --> 00:41.251
SO I GAVE HER ALL MY BEST IDEAS:

00:41.252 --> 00:44.003
THE FLOWERS, THE
CAKE, THE CATERER...

00:44.004 --> 00:45.165
EVEN THE VENUE.

00:45.166 --> 00:47.167
IT'S MY FAVORITE LOCATION
IN ALL OF TOLEDO.

00:47.168 --> 00:48.588
DISCOUNT WINE BARN?

00:48.589 --> 00:50.760
NO, THAT PARKING'S HORRIBLE.

00:50.761 --> 00:54.013
THE PAVILION BY THE
POND AT THE ARBORETUM.

00:54.014 --> 00:57.557
OOH, MAYBE SOME DAY YOU AND
JOE CAN GET MARRIED THERE.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.229
OHH, MAYBE.

00:59.230 --> 01:02.021
ANYHOW, IT'S ALWAYS BOOKED
WAY WAY WAY IN ADVANCE.

01:02.022 --> 01:03.563
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
EXACTLY HOW FAR,

01:03.564 --> 01:05.395
BUT LIKE 23 MONTHS
AND NINE DAYS.

01:05.396 --> 01:07.777
HELLO, BEAUTIFUL LADIES.

01:07.778 --> 01:09.359
- HI.
- OH HEY, GOOD. YOU'RE HERE.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.070
- SIGN THIS.
- WHAT IS IT?

01:11.071 --> 01:12.572
- JUST SIGN IT.
- I DON'T SIGN ANYTHING

01:12.573 --> 01:14.033
WHEN I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M SIGNING.

01:14.034 --> 01:15.745
I LEARNED THAT THE HARD,

01:15.746 --> 01:17.247
LOSE-EVERYTHING-YOU-OWN WAY.

01:17.248 --> 01:18.998
FINE, I'LL JUST SIGN IT FOR YOU.

01:18.999 --> 01:22.041
"LOVE, MEL AND JOE."

01:22.042 --> 01:23.793
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU JUST
FORGED MY SIGNATURE.

01:23.794 --> 01:25.255
IT'S NOT THAT HARD TO DO.

01:25.256 --> 01:27.467
YES, IT IS, ACTUALLY.
BECAUSE HIS "J" IS SO BIG

01:27.468 --> 01:28.918
THAT IT BARELY
FITS ON THE CHECK.

01:28.919 --> 01:31.171
- HEY!
- YOURS IS SUPER EASY, AUNT MEL.

01:31.172 --> 01:32.262
IT'S JUST "M"...

01:32.263 --> 01:34.053
HAD LOTS OF WINE.

01:34.054 --> 01:36.095
HEY!

01:36.096 --> 01:38.097
SHE'S PRETTY MUCH DEAD ON.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.519
( theme music playing )

01:39.520 --> 01:41.891
♪ I GUESS YOU'RE ♪

01:41.892 --> 01:44.815
♪ STUCK WITH ME ♪

01:46.937 --> 01:48.938
SO LET ME GUESS, EVEN
THOUGH I HAVE NO IDEA

01:48.939 --> 01:50.190
WHO THIS CARRIE AND LOU ARE,

01:50.191 --> 01:51.901
I AM THRILLED TO BE
GOING TO THEIR WEDDING.

01:51.902 --> 01:54.113
YEP, AT THE ARBORETUM
ON THE 23rd.

01:54.114 --> 01:57.157
OH, IT'S EXACTLY THE KIND OF
PLACE I'D WANT TO GET MARRIED.

01:57.158 --> 02:01.120
YOU KNOW, IF I EVER
WERE TO GET MARRIED.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.293
REALLY, YOU, MARRIED?

02:03.294 --> 02:05.665
I MEAN, WHO'D MARRY YOU?

02:05.666 --> 02:06.746
MMM.

02:06.747 --> 02:08.588
I KNOW. SOME SUCKER.

02:08.589 --> 02:10.420
WHOEVER THAT LUCKY SUCKER IS,
YOU REALLY THINK IT'S SMART

02:10.421 --> 02:12.512
TO BE SPENDING ALL THAT MONEY
ON A BIG WEDDING LIKE THAT?

02:12.513 --> 02:14.013
20 CATERERS,

02:14.014 --> 02:15.014
A 12' HIGH CAKE,

02:15.015 --> 02:16.926
A BUNCH OF BRIDESMAIDS
RUNNING AROUND

02:16.927 --> 02:18.518
IN DORKY SHERBET-COLORED
DRESSES.

02:18.519 --> 02:21.020
YOU MEAN LIKE WHEN YOU GOT
MARRIED THE FIRST TIME?

02:21.021 --> 02:22.852
EXACTLY! YES YES.

02:22.853 --> 02:24.854
I SPENT A FORTUNE ON THAT
THING AND IT DIDN'T TAKE.

02:24.855 --> 02:26.936
THAT'S WHY I THINK THE
SMART THING TO DO IS

02:26.937 --> 02:28.188
TAKE ALL THAT MONEY

02:28.189 --> 02:31.401
AND PUT IT INTO MUNICIPAL BONDS.

02:31.402 --> 02:34.734
JOE, EVERY WOMAN WANTS
A BIG LAVISH CEREMONY

02:34.735 --> 02:36.326
AT A BEAUTIFUL PLACE
LIKE THE ARBORETUM.

02:36.327 --> 02:38.488
THAT'S WHY IT'S BOOKED
TWO YEARS IN ADVANCE.

02:38.489 --> 02:39.739
OH, AND BY THE WAY,

02:39.740 --> 02:41.831
THE REASON YOU NEED
BRIDESMAIDS IN UGLY

02:41.832 --> 02:45.335
SHERBET-COLORED DRESSES IS SO THAT
THE BRIDE LOOKS LIKE A GODDESS.

02:45.336 --> 02:47.747
NAH NAH, LOOK. THE MINUTE
YOU FIND THE RIGHT PERSON,

02:47.748 --> 02:48.918
YOU GO STRAIGHT
DOWN TO CITY HALL

02:48.919 --> 02:50.840
AND JUST GET IT OVER WITH.

02:50.841 --> 02:53.253
OH, WHAT EVERY LITTLE
GIRL DREAMS OF HEARING.

02:53.254 --> 02:55.004
"DARLING, I LOVE YOU.

02:55.005 --> 02:56.717
LET'S GET IT OVER WITH."

02:59.099 --> 03:01.681
OH HEY, I JUST TEXTED YOU.
WHY DIDN'T YOU REPLY?

03:01.682 --> 03:04.063
MY PHONE FELL IN
THE TOILET AGAIN.

03:04.064 --> 03:06.185
YOU KNOW, MAYBE IT'S NOT
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY

03:06.186 --> 03:08.067
THAT YOU PLAY TEMPLE RUN
WHILE YOU'RE PEEING.

03:08.068 --> 03:11.402
OH, LIKE IT'S JUST
SO EASY TO STOP.

03:12.483 --> 03:13.983
ANYWAY, I CAN'T GET A NEW PHONE

03:13.984 --> 03:15.315
UNTIL I GET A JOB TO PAY FOR IT,

03:15.316 --> 03:16.906
AND ALL THE PLACES I
APPLIED TO REJECTED ME.

03:16.907 --> 03:18.908
HOT DIGGITY DOG, THE BRAT HOUSE,

03:18.909 --> 03:19.989
WEINER-LOVER.

03:19.990 --> 03:21.911
I'VE DRIVEN BY THAT LAST PLACE.

03:21.912 --> 03:24.874
THEY DON'T SELL HOT DOGS.

03:24.875 --> 03:26.416
IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYWAY,

03:26.417 --> 03:28.458
BECAUSE ALL THE PLACES I APPLIED
TO WANT JOB EXPERIENCE.

03:28.459 --> 03:30.830
HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED
TO GET JOB EXPERIENCE

03:30.831 --> 03:32.171
IF NOBODY WILL HIRE YOU?

03:32.172 --> 03:33.503
YOU WRITE A RESUME.

03:33.504 --> 03:35.214
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT? WE CAN
WRITE ONE RIGHT NOW.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.926
OKAY, AND WE'RE DONE

03:36.927 --> 03:38.338
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T HAD ANY JOBS.

03:38.339 --> 03:40.930
OKAY, SO MAKE SOME UP.

03:40.931 --> 03:42.342
REALLY? JUST MAKE THEM UP?

03:42.343 --> 03:45.014
- LIKE, LIE?
- YEP, GO.

03:45.015 --> 03:46.936
OKAY.

03:46.937 --> 03:50.149
WELL, I ONCE TRAINED
MONKEYS FOR NASA.

03:50.150 --> 03:54.023
YEAH, I DON'T SEE YOU
OUTRANKING MONKEYS.

03:54.024 --> 03:55.815
TRY SOMETHING SEMI-BELIEVABLE.

03:55.816 --> 03:58.528
UM, FOR REAL, I CUT MRS.
HENDERSON'S LAWN.

03:58.529 --> 04:00.990
THERE YOU GO. "HEAD
GROUNDSKEEPER,

04:00.991 --> 04:02.912
HENDERSON ESTATE."

04:02.913 --> 04:04.574
MRS. HENDERSON HATED ME THOUGH.

04:04.575 --> 04:06.916
I KIND OF MOWED HER KID'S BUNNY.

04:06.917 --> 04:08.247
JUST THE TAIL.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.869
THOSE GROW BACK, RIGHT?

04:09.870 --> 04:11.501
OKAY.

04:11.502 --> 04:13.753
SO SHE WON'T BE A REFERENCE.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.505
BUT THE GOOD NEWS
IS THERE'S NO WAY

04:15.506 --> 04:17.757
FOR YOUR PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYERS
TO KNOW IF THEY'RE TALKING TO

04:17.758 --> 04:19.339
YOUR ACTUAL FORMER BOSS,

04:19.340 --> 04:21.010
SO REALLY YOU JUST
NEED A GOOD FRIEND

04:21.011 --> 04:23.142
WHO WILL ANSWER THE PHONE
AND SAY POSITIVE THINGS.

04:23.143 --> 04:24.344
I COULD ASK MY BUDDY JASON.

04:24.345 --> 04:25.935
UM, CAN I BORROW YOUR PHONE?

04:25.936 --> 04:28.187
NO WAY. I DON'T WANT MINE
TO END UP IN THE TOILET.

04:28.188 --> 04:31.891
- USE THE LANDLINE.
- THE WHAT?

04:31.892 --> 04:32.942
THAT.

04:32.943 --> 04:34.193
THE LANDLINE.

04:34.194 --> 04:36.026
OH YEAH, THAT. OKAY.

04:37.898 --> 04:39.109
CALL JASON.

04:40.901 --> 04:42.402
I'M KIDDING.

04:42.403 --> 04:44.905
BUT BUNNIES TAILS DO
GROW BACK, RIGHT?

04:48.619 --> 04:50.290
( gunshots )

04:54.335 --> 04:55.965
HEY, CARRIE.

04:55.966 --> 04:57.377
WHEN YOU GAVE ME THE
ADDRESS, I THOUGHT

04:57.378 --> 04:59.419
WE WERE MEETING AT A NEW
COFFEE SHOP OR SOMETHING.

04:59.420 --> 05:01.050
BUT, YOU KNOW,
THIS IS GREAT TOO.

05:01.051 --> 05:03.343
HEY, LOOK. THE GUY AT THE
FRONT DESK THOUGHT I WAS CUTE

05:03.344 --> 05:05.765
AND GAVE ME A COMPLIMENTARY
BOX OF LIPSTICK BULLETS.

05:05.766 --> 05:06.976
AREN'T THEY ADORABLE?

05:06.977 --> 05:08.097
( gunfire )

05:08.098 --> 05:09.929
LOU AND I HAD A HUGE FIGHT.

05:09.930 --> 05:11.431
THE WEDDING'S OFF.

05:11.432 --> 05:12.852
OH, COME ON.

05:12.853 --> 05:14.023
OKAY, WITH WEDDINGS

05:14.024 --> 05:15.565
A LOT OF PEOPLE GET COLD FEET.

05:15.566 --> 05:16.986
HE TOLD ME HE HAS

05:16.987 --> 05:19.739
A SECRET WIFE AND
KIDS IN CINCINNATI

05:19.740 --> 05:22.241
AND ASKED ME IF THAT
WOULD BE A PROBLEM.

05:22.242 --> 05:25.114
HEY, HE GETS POINTS
FOR ASKING, RIGHT?

05:25.115 --> 05:28.117
OKAY, ARE YOU SURE YOU WOULDN'T
RATHER GO GET A MANI-PEDI

05:28.118 --> 05:30.079
OR SOMETHING A LITTLE LESS...

05:30.080 --> 05:31.001
SHOOTY?

05:31.002 --> 05:32.622
NO.

05:32.623 --> 05:35.334
SINCE I BECAME A COP, THIS
IS WHERE I COME TO RELAX.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.417
WOW, NICE GROUPING.

05:37.418 --> 05:39.008
RIGHT IN THE BELLS.

05:39.009 --> 05:41.961
( sighs ) HONEY, LET
ME GIVE YOU A HUG...

05:41.962 --> 05:44.093
AS SOON AS YOU PUT THE GUN AWAY.

05:44.094 --> 05:46.345
YOU KNOW I FEEL BAD FOR YOU TOO.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.768
I MEAN, ALL THE WORK
YOU PUT INTO THIS?

05:48.769 --> 05:51.350
YOU FOUND ME THE FLORIST
AND THE CATERER,

05:51.351 --> 05:52.852
AND THE ARBORETUM!

05:52.853 --> 05:55.064
OH, YOU'RE SO SWEET, BUT
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

05:55.065 --> 05:57.356
AND NOW I HAVE TO
SUFFER THE HUMILIATION

05:57.357 --> 05:59.739
OF CALLING AND
CANCELING EVERYTHING.

05:59.740 --> 06:01.901
NO NO, YOU DON'T. HEY,
I'LL HANDLE ALL THAT.

06:01.902 --> 06:03.943
I'LL CALL THE FLORIST, I
WILL CALL THE CATERER

06:03.944 --> 06:06.285
AND I WILL CALL AND CANCEL THE
RESERVATION AT THE ARBORETUM.

06:06.286 --> 06:08.247
- OH, THANK YOU.
- FOR A WEDDING.

06:08.248 --> 06:11.080
IN FOUR WEEKS.

06:11.081 --> 06:12.953
OOH.

06:14.995 --> 06:17.917
OKAY, WAIT. SO LOU THOUGHT
THAT HE COULD GET AWAY

06:17.918 --> 06:19.258
WITH HAVING TWO WIVES?

06:19.259 --> 06:21.000
YES, AND IF YOU'VE EVER
SEEN HIM IN BIKE SHORTS,

06:21.001 --> 06:23.463
YOU WONDER HOW HE EVER GOT
ONE WOMAN TO MARRY HIM.

06:23.464 --> 06:26.926
OH, MAN. SO THAT MEANS THEY'RE GONNA
LOSE THEIR RESERVATION AT THE ARBORETUM?

06:26.927 --> 06:29.058
WOW, THAT'S GONNA COST THEM.

06:29.059 --> 06:33.683
UNLESS THEY WERE TO FIND SOMEONE
ELSE TO TAKE THE RESERVATION

06:33.684 --> 06:35.725
FOR, I DON'T KNOW...

06:35.726 --> 06:38.317
MY WEDDING?

06:38.318 --> 06:39.479
WAIT, WHAT?

06:39.480 --> 06:41.901
YOU AND JOE IN 30 DAYS?

06:41.902 --> 06:43.903
AUNT MEL, THAT'S INSANE.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.946
INSANELY AWESOME.

06:47.738 --> 06:50.159
BUT YOU AND JOE
AREN'T EVEN ENGAGED.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.791
HOW ARE YOU GONNA
TALK HIM INTO THIS?

06:51.792 --> 06:53.913
THE SAME WAY YOU TALK MEN
INTO DOING ANYTHING.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.995
MAKE THEM THINK IT'S THEIR IDEA.

06:55.996 --> 06:58.037
OOH, THAT IS SO SNEAKY.

06:58.038 --> 06:59.879
MM, PLEASE.

06:59.880 --> 07:01.751
I PREFER DIABOLICAL.

07:01.752 --> 07:02.922
AND HERE'S MY EVIL LAUGH.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.636
( both laugh )

07:08.759 --> 07:10.930
WHAT ARE YOU TWO LAUGHING ABOUT?

07:10.931 --> 07:12.352
Both: NOTHING.

07:19.269 --> 07:21.320
SO THEN CARRIE SAID

07:21.321 --> 07:23.062
"OLIVIA? WHO'S OLIVIA?"

07:23.063 --> 07:25.485
LOU FESSED UP AND SHOWED HER
PICTURES OF HIS OTHER WIFE,

07:25.486 --> 07:27.236
HIS KIDS AND HIS BULLDOG

07:27.237 --> 07:29.199
WHOSE NAME IS... GET THIS...
CARRIE.

07:30.621 --> 07:32.121
HOW MESSED UP IS THAT?

07:32.122 --> 07:33.663
SO MESSED UP.

07:33.664 --> 07:35.495
98...

07:35.496 --> 07:36.916
99...

07:36.917 --> 07:38.457
3,000.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.960
SO THE WEDDING IS PFFT.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.922
AND THEY'RE GONNA LOSE A
TON OF MONEY ON FLOWERS

07:42.923 --> 07:45.084
AND THE CATERER AND
THE ARBORETUM.

07:45.085 --> 07:46.756
BUT AS I WAS TELLING LENNOX,

07:46.757 --> 07:48.848
MAYBE THEY COULD
FIND SOMEBODY ELSE

07:48.849 --> 07:50.299
TO TAKE THE DATE.

07:50.300 --> 07:51.141
OOH, I KNOW.

07:51.142 --> 07:53.553
- YOU DO?
- YEAH.

07:53.554 --> 07:55.645
PUT IT ON EBAY.

07:55.646 --> 07:58.147
YOU JUST TOLD ME EVERYONE'S DYING TO
GET MARRIED AT THAT PAVILION THINGY.

07:58.148 --> 08:00.900
- IT'LL GO IN A HEARTBEAT.
- NO, YOU DON'T SELL SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO A STRANGER.

08:00.901 --> 08:03.102
OKAY, WHATEVER.

08:03.103 --> 08:05.104
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
HONEY, BUT I'M READY FOR BED.

08:05.105 --> 08:07.486
AND NOT SLEEPY BED.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.569
FUN BED.

08:09.570 --> 08:11.070
WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT.

08:11.071 --> 08:12.912
YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU'RE
ONTO SOMETHING.

08:12.913 --> 08:13.993
YOU HAD A GOOD IDEA.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.204
YEAH, FUN BED.

08:15.205 --> 08:16.576
NO NO NO, BEFORE THAT.

08:16.577 --> 08:19.418
ABOUT FINDING SOMEONE ELSE
TO TAKE THE RESERVATION.

08:19.419 --> 08:21.961
- THAT WASN'T MY IDEA, HONEY. THAT WAS YOUR IDEA.
- NO NO NO.

08:21.962 --> 08:25.124
THAT WAS ALL JOE LONGO, YOU
PROBLEM-SOLVING GENIUS.

08:25.125 --> 08:27.046
I AM FULL OF A LOT
OF GOOD IDEAS.

08:27.047 --> 08:29.428
YEAH. LIKE YOU SAID,

08:29.429 --> 08:32.391
IF ONLY THERE WERE SOME WAY TO GET
SOMEONE TO SAVE THAT RESERVATION.

08:32.392 --> 08:35.224
MM-HMM, YEP. THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT
WHAT I'M THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW.

08:35.225 --> 08:36.265
HANG ON, HANG ON.

08:36.266 --> 08:38.187
THERE'S GOT TO BE
SOMEONE WE KNOW

08:38.188 --> 08:39.769
THAT WANTS TO HAVE A BAR MITZVAH

08:39.770 --> 08:41.941
OR A RETIREMENT PARTY,

08:41.942 --> 08:43.442
OR, I DON'T KNOW, A WEDDING?

08:43.443 --> 08:45.815
HONEY, NO ONE'S GONNA PLAN
A BIG EVENT LIKE THAT

08:45.816 --> 08:46.986
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

08:46.987 --> 08:48.147
WELL, THEY MIGHT.

08:48.148 --> 08:49.649
IF THEY WERE REALLY IN LOVE.

08:49.650 --> 08:52.201
I KNOW. BUT IT'S...

08:52.202 --> 08:53.993
WHAT THE HELL'S ON THIS?
A COMBINATION LOCK?

08:53.994 --> 08:55.494
JOE.

08:55.495 --> 08:57.206
LET'S GET MARRIED.

08:57.207 --> 08:58.367
- WHAT?
- YEAH.

08:58.368 --> 09:00.920
MARRY ME AT THE
ARBORETUM ON THE 23rd

09:00.921 --> 09:03.252
BETWEEN NOON AND 6:00 P.M.

09:03.253 --> 09:04.214
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
- YEAH.

09:04.215 --> 09:06.255
IT'S AVAILABLE, I'M AVAILABLE.

09:06.256 --> 09:07.426
ACTUALLY, I WILL HAVE
TO CANCEL SOMETHING,

09:07.427 --> 09:08.839
BUT I WILL BE AVAILABLE.

09:10.260 --> 09:11.510
WOW.

09:11.511 --> 09:12.932
YOU KNOW, THIS IS... THIS IS...

09:12.933 --> 09:14.093
IT'S SO UNEXPECTED.

09:14.094 --> 09:17.096
I MEAN, YOU SURE IT'S
NOT TOO FAST, HONEY?

09:17.097 --> 09:19.889
I MEAN, WE'VE ONLY BEEN
GOING OUT A FEW MONTHS.

09:19.890 --> 09:22.101
WELL, I'M READY.

09:22.102 --> 09:23.273
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

09:25.065 --> 09:26.736
I MEAN...

09:26.737 --> 09:28.067
IT'S INCREDIBLY SWEET.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.899
- BUT...
- STOP.

09:29.900 --> 09:31.070
GOT IT.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.491
I HEARD THE "BUT."

09:32.492 --> 09:33.572
I KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.075
IT IS AN EXTREMELY NICE OFFER.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.077
- IT'S JUST THAT...
- NICE OFFER?

09:38.078 --> 09:41.290
NO NO NO. NICE OFFER IS
"LADIES DRINK FREE."

09:41.291 --> 09:43.582
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.
- YEAH, I KNOW WHAT YOU MEANT.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.334
YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED
IN MARRYING ME.

09:45.335 --> 09:47.917
IT'S... I GET IT.
MESSAGE RECEIVED.

09:47.918 --> 09:51.922
SO LET'S GET BACK TO THE
TASK AT HAND, RIGHT?

09:53.093 --> 09:54.514
GO AHEAD.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.309
THAT'S NOT REALLY THAT SEXY.

10:00.310 --> 10:03.102
YEAH WELL, THIS IS ALL I GOT.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.935
SO HAVE YOUR WAY.

10:07.778 --> 10:09.820
I'M GOOD.

10:11.281 --> 10:13.653
SO YOU JUST ASKED
HIM, JUST LIKE THAT?

10:13.654 --> 10:15.444
JUST "HEY, JOE, YOU
WANT TO GET MARRIED?"

10:15.445 --> 10:17.196
I THOUGHT HE WAS READY.

10:17.197 --> 10:19.498
I GUESS I'M JUST NOT THE RIGHT PERSON.
WHAT ELSE COULD IT BE?

10:19.499 --> 10:21.290
YOU ARE TOTALLY
THE RIGHT PERSON.

10:21.291 --> 10:22.953
WELL, TELL THAT TO
MY STUPID TRUE LOVE.

10:24.004 --> 10:25.294
OH HEY, RYDER.

10:25.295 --> 10:27.416
- HOW'S THE JOB SEARCH GOING?
- OH, LOUSY.

10:27.417 --> 10:30.210
FAKE ME SHOULD HAVE NEVER QUIT
TRAINING MONKEYS AT NASA.

10:31.421 --> 10:32.421
DON'T ASK.

10:32.422 --> 10:34.253
I WENT TO THE MALL A WEEK AGO

10:34.254 --> 10:36.255
AND FILLED OUT LIKE
40 APPLICATIONS.

10:36.256 --> 10:37.426
DIDN'T HEAR BACK FROM ANYBODY.

10:37.427 --> 10:39.258
SERIOUSLY? THAT MANY
AND NOT A NIBBLE?

10:39.259 --> 10:41.100
YEAH, IF YOU DON'T
BELIEVE ME, ASK JOE.

10:41.101 --> 10:42.261
HE WAS THERE. I SAW HIM.

10:42.262 --> 10:43.723
HE WAS AT SOME JEWELRY STORE.

10:43.724 --> 10:46.766
WHOA. REWIND. JOE WAS
AT A JEWELRY STORE?

10:46.767 --> 10:49.068
YEAH, THE FANCY ONE ACROSS
FROM THE HOT DOG PLACE.

10:49.069 --> 10:52.071
AUNT MEL, THAT'S IT.
THAT'S THE "WHAT ELSE."

10:52.072 --> 10:54.984
THAT'S WHY JOE DIDN'T WANT TO
GET MARRIED WHEN YOU ASKED HIM.

10:54.985 --> 10:56.235
YOU ASKED JOE TO MARRY YOU?

10:56.236 --> 10:58.617
THAT'S BALLSY.

10:58.618 --> 11:01.240
NO, THINK ABOUT IT. A
WEDDING IS A WOMAN'S ARENA.

11:01.241 --> 11:04.043
WHAT IS THE MAN'S ONLY
WEDDING-RELATED RESPONSIBILITY?

11:04.044 --> 11:07.086
SAY "I DO" AND DON'T HIT
ON THE BRIDESMAIDS?

11:07.087 --> 11:09.088
NO. IT'S THE PROPOSAL.

11:09.089 --> 11:12.131
THE ONLY THING THE MAN CAN CONTROL
IS WHEN HE POPS THE QUESTION,

11:12.132 --> 11:15.925
SO JOE WAS AT THE JEWELRY STORE
LOOKING AT ENGAGEMENT RINGS.

11:15.926 --> 11:17.176
HOLY SMOKES, THAT'S IT!

11:17.177 --> 11:19.598
JOE'S GONNA PROPOSE.

11:19.599 --> 11:22.101
I'M GONNA GET OUT OF HERE
BEFORE THE SQUEALING STARTS.

11:22.102 --> 11:24.724
( both squealing ) OH MY
GOD, OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD!

11:24.725 --> 11:26.685
WAIT, HOLD IT, HOLD IT.
WE CAN'T CELEBRATE YET.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.068
- BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHEN IT'S GONNA HAPPEN.
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

11:29.069 --> 11:30.399
YEAH.

11:30.400 --> 11:31.811
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,

11:31.812 --> 11:33.272
- NOW I JUST HAVE TO WAIT.
- MM-HMM.

11:33.273 --> 11:34.904
NO PROBLEM THERE.

11:34.905 --> 11:37.407
I CAN LIVE WITH THE UNCERTAINTY
OF NOT KNOWING WHEN.

11:38.819 --> 11:41.821
WHEN. WHEN...

11:41.822 --> 11:44.164
- WHEN, DAMN IT, WHEN?!
- ( yelps )

11:45.956 --> 11:48.087
CHEZ BEAUMETTE? YEAH,
THIS IS JOE LONGO.

11:48.088 --> 11:49.749
I'M JUST CALLING TO CONFIRM MY
RESERVATION FOR THIS EVENING

11:49.750 --> 11:51.540
FOR A PARTY OF TWO, 6:30 P.M.

11:51.541 --> 11:53.002
OKAY, GREAT.

11:53.003 --> 11:55.094
THAT'S A SUNSET-VIEW
TABLE, RIGHT?

11:55.095 --> 11:56.335
PERFECT, THANKS.

11:56.336 --> 11:57.927
SO.

11:57.928 --> 12:00.139
TONIGHT'S THE BIG NIGHT, HUH?

12:00.140 --> 12:02.802
YOU'RE GONNA ASK AUNT
MEL TO MARRY YOU?

12:02.803 --> 12:05.434
- WHAT? WHERE'D YOU GET AN IDEA LIKE THAT?
- WHEN I TOLD AUNT MEL

12:05.435 --> 12:07.646
AND LENNOX THAT I'D SEEN
YOU AT THE JEWELRY STORE,

12:07.647 --> 12:09.899
THEY KIND OF PUT
TWO-AND-TWO TOGETHER.

12:09.900 --> 12:12.061
AND THEN THEY
EXPLAINED IT TO ME.

12:12.062 --> 12:14.524
YOU GUYS ARE ALL WRONG. I'M
JUST TAKING HER OUT TO EAT.

12:15.816 --> 12:18.157
- RIGHT.
- CAN'T A GUY TAKE HIS GIRL OUT

12:18.158 --> 12:19.989
FOR A NICE MEAL WITHOUT
IT BEING A BIG DEAL?

12:19.990 --> 12:21.490
OH NO. I GOT YOU.

12:21.491 --> 12:24.323
KEEP IT ON THE DOWN LOW.

12:24.324 --> 12:26.916
WHAT? NO. DUDE,
THERE'S NO DOWN, MAN.

12:26.917 --> 12:29.919
- THERE'S NO LOW.
- ( chuckles ) INDEED.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.501
PLAYA.

12:33.924 --> 12:35.504
IT'S TONIGHT. IT'S TONIGHT.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.176
JOE IS PROPOSING TONIGHT.

12:37.177 --> 12:39.088
- WHAT?
- YES. RYDER JUST TOLD ME

12:39.089 --> 12:40.549
THAT HE'S TAKING YOU
TO CHEZ BEAUMETTE.

12:40.550 --> 12:42.431
- CHEZ BEAUMETTE?
- YEAH.

12:42.432 --> 12:45.344
"TOLEDO LIVING" SAID IT'S THE
NUMBER-ONE PLACE IN TOWN TO PROPOSE.

12:45.345 --> 12:48.307
YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW THAT? I
HAVE BEEN A BRIDESMAID 25 TIMES.

12:48.308 --> 12:50.980
OH CRAP. THIS IS NOT A
GETTING-PROPOSED-TO DRESS.

12:50.981 --> 12:53.602
OKAY, WHICH ONE OF
THESE SAYS "YES."

12:53.603 --> 12:55.274
UH, GREEN? GREEN MEANS GO.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.236
MM, TOO LONG.

12:56.237 --> 12:58.277
( groans ) TOO FUNERAL-Y.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.569
TOO "REAL HOUSEWIVES."

13:00.570 --> 13:02.822
Joe: HEY, MEL. ARE YOU
READY TO GO, HONEY?

13:02.823 --> 13:04.743
- ALMOST.
- ALL RIGHT, HURRY UP.

13:04.744 --> 13:06.665
WE DON'T WANT TO BE LATE
FOR OUR BIG NIGHT OUT.

13:06.666 --> 13:08.457
OH MY GOD! THIS IS IT.

13:08.458 --> 13:10.329
SHUT UP. YOU CAN'T JINX IT.

13:10.330 --> 13:12.912
YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:12.913 --> 13:14.584
( both squealing )

13:16.086 --> 13:17.126
ARE YOU GUYS LAUGHING ABOUT?

13:17.127 --> 13:19.009
Both: NOTHING.

13:22.262 --> 13:23.423
( muffled squealing )

13:28.388 --> 13:29.728
( cellphone ringing )

13:29.729 --> 13:32.521
RYDER, WHY DOES ZAPS
INCREDIBLE KEEP CALLING ME?

13:32.522 --> 13:35.144
OH, THAT'S THE LASER TAG PLACE.
ANSWER IT, ANSWER IT.

13:35.145 --> 13:36.395
BUT WHY?

13:36.396 --> 13:37.776
'CAUSE I'M APPLYING
FOR A JOB THERE.

13:37.777 --> 13:39.278
YOU'RE MY BOSS.
YOU'RE MY REFERENCE.

13:39.279 --> 13:41.030
YOU LOVE ME. YOU
THOUGHT I WAS GREAT.

13:41.031 --> 13:42.201
OH, AND YOU'RE JAMAICAN.

13:42.202 --> 13:44.613
GO.

13:44.614 --> 13:47.206
( Jamaican accent ) HELLO...
MON.

13:47.207 --> 13:50.210
YEAH, RYDER BE A
FANTASTIC EMPLOYEE, MON.

13:51.331 --> 13:54.333
YEAH, HIS WORK
HABITS BE JAMMIN'.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.794
NO WORRIES, MON.

13:55.795 --> 13:58.218
WITH RYDER, EVERY SINGLE
THING GONNA BE JUST FINE.

13:59.379 --> 14:00.589
YOU WERE GREAT.

14:00.590 --> 14:02.461
OKAY, DON'T EVER DO THAT AGAIN.

14:02.462 --> 14:04.173
WHAT, MAKE YOU DO AN ACCENT?

14:04.174 --> 14:06.726
NO, MAKE ME SAY NICE
THINGS ABOUT YOU.

14:09.059 --> 14:10.640
( accordion music playing )

14:14.184 --> 14:16.025
- TO US.
- TO US.

14:16.026 --> 14:18.527
OH, THIS IS SUCH A
BEAUTIFUL PLACE.

14:18.528 --> 14:20.279
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
IT'S FAMOUS FOR?

14:20.280 --> 14:22.821
MM, NO, WHAT?

14:22.822 --> 14:24.243
WELL, HONEY, "TOLEDO
LIVING" SAYS

14:24.244 --> 14:28.037
THIS IS THE BEST
PLACE IN TOWN FOR...

14:28.038 --> 14:30.199
BOUILLABAISSE.

14:30.200 --> 14:32.041
BOUI... WHAT?

14:32.042 --> 14:34.704
THAT... I DID NOT KNOW THAT.

14:36.046 --> 14:38.257
THE LIGHTING IN HERE IS REALLY
MAKING YOUR EYES DANCE.

14:38.258 --> 14:40.499
JOE.

14:40.500 --> 14:42.712
HOLD THAT THOUGHT. EXCUSE ME.

14:44.634 --> 14:47.347
COULD I ASK YOU A
SPECIAL FAVOR, PLEASE?

14:49.389 --> 14:51.811
COULD YOU STAY ON THAT SIDE OF THE ROOM?
I CAN'T HEAR MYSELF TALK.

14:54.474 --> 14:55.894
IT WASN'T BOTHERING ME.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.566
YEAH? WELL, MAYBE I
HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT

14:57.567 --> 14:59.438
QUESTION TO ASK YOU AND I WANT TO
MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN HEAR IT.

14:59.439 --> 15:02.191
OH, YEAH? LIKE WHAT?

15:02.192 --> 15:04.404
WELL, YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN...

15:07.527 --> 15:09.618
I'VE BEEN THINKING
A LOT ABOUT US.

15:09.619 --> 15:12.371
AND I THINK IT MIGHT BE TIME

15:12.372 --> 15:14.743
THAT WE MAKE A LITTLE
CHANGE TO OUR ARRANGEMENT.

15:14.744 --> 15:16.625
OH? AND I SUPPOSE

15:16.626 --> 15:18.297
YOU HAVE AN IDEA
ON HOW TO DO THAT

15:18.298 --> 15:20.749
WITH ONE QUESTION?

15:20.750 --> 15:22.211
YES, I DO.

15:22.212 --> 15:23.502
SO I WANTED TO ASK YOU

15:23.503 --> 15:27.046
IF...

15:27.047 --> 15:29.218
I CAN MOVE INTO YOUR ROOM
AND WE CAN TURN MY ROOM

15:29.219 --> 15:33.052
INTO THE LONGO FIT
CORPORATE OFFICES.

15:33.053 --> 15:36.355
THAT... THAT'S YOUR QUESTION?

15:36.356 --> 15:38.557
YEAH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME
RIGHT NOW, HONEY. YOU CAN WAIT.

15:38.558 --> 15:41.610
YEAH, I CAN WAIT. I CAN WAIT.

15:41.611 --> 15:43.942
YES. OH MY GOD, YES!

15:43.943 --> 15:46.946
( applause )

15:48.118 --> 15:49.368
ISN'T THAT SOMETHING, SWEETIE?

15:49.369 --> 15:51.830
SURE IS. ( chuckles )

15:51.831 --> 15:53.452
YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:53.453 --> 15:54.703
THAT JUST GOT ME THINKING.

15:54.704 --> 15:57.336
YES, JOE?

15:57.337 --> 15:59.579
MAYBE THEY CAN USE THE
RESERVATION AT THE ARBORETUM.

16:01.631 --> 16:03.002
SURE, WHY THE HELL NOT?

16:03.003 --> 16:04.793
GARCON, HIT ME.

16:04.794 --> 16:06.385
OH, YOU KNOW, HONEY?

16:06.386 --> 16:08.387
I KNOW I'VE PROBABLY SEEMED
A LITTLE PREOCCUPIED

16:08.388 --> 16:09.928
SINCE WE WALKED IN
HERE THIS EVENING,

16:09.929 --> 16:11.970
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE EVER SINCE
WE SAT DOWN AT THIS TABLE

16:11.971 --> 16:13.892
I HAVE BEEN DYING
TO DO SOMETHING.

16:13.893 --> 16:15.014
YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:15.015 --> 16:17.357
I JUST CANNOT WAIT ANY LONGER.

16:26.196 --> 16:28.197
SO MUCH BETTER.

16:28.198 --> 16:30.160
THAT WOBBLING WAS
DRIVING ME NUTS.

16:31.201 --> 16:32.782
ME TOO. WOBBLING.

16:34.574 --> 16:36.576
( sighs )

16:41.211 --> 16:42.621
HEY, MEL.

16:42.622 --> 16:44.293
ARE YOU OKAY? YOU
SEEM A LITTLE QUIET.

16:44.294 --> 16:46.045
OH, I'M FINE.

16:46.046 --> 16:47.926
PERFECTLY PERFECTLY FINE.

16:47.927 --> 16:51.220
DINNER JUST WASN'T EXACTLY WHAT
I WAS EXPECTING, THAT'S ALL.

16:51.221 --> 16:52.551
I KNOW.

16:52.552 --> 16:54.593
THE BOUILLABAISSE NOT
THE BEST, RIGHT?

16:54.594 --> 16:57.056
WELL, ANYWAY, I MAY
HAVE SOMETHING

16:57.057 --> 16:59.398
THAT WILL MAKE YOU FEEL
A LITTLE BIT BETTER.

16:59.399 --> 17:01.350
RYDER, LENNOX!

17:01.351 --> 17:03.272
COULD YOU GUYS COME
IN HERE, PLEASE?

17:03.273 --> 17:05.444
I HAVE A PRESENTATION
I'D LIKE TO MAKE,

17:05.445 --> 17:08.357
AND I'D APPRECIATE IT IF YOU
WERE ALL HERE TO WITNESS IT.

17:08.358 --> 17:10.199
WHAT'S UP?

17:10.200 --> 17:12.201
THIS IS KIND OF A BIG MOMENT,

17:12.202 --> 17:14.283
AND I THOUGHT IT'D BE
BEST TO DO IT HERE

17:14.284 --> 17:15.915
WITH ALL OF US AT OUR HOME.

17:16.996 --> 17:18.287
I'M VERY OLD SCHOOL.

17:18.288 --> 17:20.038
AS YOU KNOW,

17:20.039 --> 17:21.960
I'M A TRADITIONAL GUY.

17:21.961 --> 17:23.292
YES, YOU ARE.

17:23.293 --> 17:24.663
AND I LOVE THAT ABOUT YOU, JOE.

17:24.664 --> 17:26.666
THANK YOU, MEL. THANK YOU.

17:30.930 --> 17:32.801
RYDER, THIS IS FOR YOU.

17:32.802 --> 17:35.304
SERIOUSLY?

17:35.305 --> 17:36.635
OH MY GOD, JOE.

17:36.636 --> 17:38.887
THIS IS SO UNEXPECTED.

17:38.888 --> 17:41.019
WELL, I KNOW YOU'RE...

17:41.020 --> 17:42.351
OUT THERE LOOKING FOR A JOB.

17:42.352 --> 17:43.892
AND ONE DAY WHEN
YOU FIND THAT JOB

17:43.893 --> 17:45.274
YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO
BE THERE ON TIME.

17:45.275 --> 17:47.736
KIDS LOOK AT THEIR PHONES.

17:47.737 --> 17:51.110
BUT MEN LOOK AT THEIR WATCHES.

17:51.111 --> 17:52.281
WOW.

17:52.282 --> 17:53.283
THANK YOU, JOE. AUNT MEL, LOOK.

17:55.115 --> 17:57.326
YEAH YEAH. THAT'S REAL NICE.

17:57.327 --> 17:59.077
MEL, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.330
I JUST GAVE RYDER A VERY EXPENSIVE
WATCH AND YOU ACT LIKE IT'S NOTHING.

18:01.331 --> 18:02.461
NO, IT'S NOT NOTHING.

18:02.462 --> 18:04.543
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL
PIECE OF JEWELRY.

18:04.544 --> 18:06.546
FOR RYDER, WHO DROPS
THINGS IN THE TOILET!

18:09.048 --> 18:11.380
WHAT'S WRONG, HONEY?

18:11.381 --> 18:13.302
I JUST FEEL LIKE SUCH A MORON!

18:13.303 --> 18:15.053
YOU TOOK ME TO THE MOST
ROMANTIC RESTAURANT

18:15.054 --> 18:16.975
IN ALL OF TOLEDO AT SUNSET,

18:16.976 --> 18:18.927
FOR THE BOUILLABAISSE.

18:18.928 --> 18:20.599
THEN YOU PAID THE ACCORDION GUY

18:20.600 --> 18:22.271
TO NOT PLAY A ROMANTIC SONG,

18:22.272 --> 18:24.102
AND THEN YOU GOT
DOWN ON ONE KNEE,

18:24.103 --> 18:26.025
AND ADJUSTED THE FREAKING TABLE!

18:27.187 --> 18:30.609
THE WHOLE NIGHT I THOUGHT YOU
WERE GONNA PROPOSE TO ME.

18:30.610 --> 18:33.572
OH MY GOSH. THAT WAS
SO INSENSITIVE OF ME.

18:33.573 --> 18:35.404
I SHOULD HAVE PUT
TWO-AND-TWO TOGETHER.

18:35.405 --> 18:38.617
OF COURSE, I TAKE YOU OUT
TO THAT AMAZING RESTAURANT

18:38.618 --> 18:41.620
AND OH, WE COME HOME AND
I PULL THIS BAG OUT

18:41.621 --> 18:43.202
AND I PULL A BOX OUT OF IT.

18:43.203 --> 18:45.123
BUT THE BOX IS NOT FOR
YOU, IT'S FOR RYDER.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.125
AND THE WHOLE TIME YOU'RE THINKING
I'M GONNA PROPOSE TO YOU,

18:47.126 --> 18:48.837
AND THAT IS JUST... WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT'S THIS?

18:48.838 --> 18:49.959
( gasps )

18:52.592 --> 18:54.964
OKAY, BE QUIET. I'M FILMING.

18:56.596 --> 18:59.017
MEL,

18:59.018 --> 19:01.600
EVER SINCE WE FIRST MET,

19:01.601 --> 19:04.183
WE HAVE DONE NOTHING
BUT DISAGREE

19:04.184 --> 19:06.396
AND ARGUE AND FIGHT.

19:07.897 --> 19:09.438
YOU NEVER MISS AN OPPORTUNITY

19:09.439 --> 19:12.030
TO TELL ME WHEN I'M
DOING SOMETHING WRONG

19:12.031 --> 19:13.613
EVERY SINGLE TIME I DO IT.

19:15.535 --> 19:17.406
AND I'M A BETTER MAN FOR IT.

19:17.407 --> 19:20.739
( chuckles )

19:20.740 --> 19:24.203
I CAN'T IMAGINE MY LIFE
WITHOUT YOU IN IT.

19:24.204 --> 19:26.205
AND IF YOU STICK WITH ME,

19:26.206 --> 19:29.127
I PROMISE YOU I WILL SPEND
THE REST OF MY DAYS

19:29.128 --> 19:30.709
DOING EVERYTHING I CAN
TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE

19:30.710 --> 19:32.252
THE HAPPIEST WOMAN
ON THIS EARTH.

19:36.055 --> 19:37.217
SO...

19:41.180 --> 19:42.472
MEL BURKE,

19:44.434 --> 19:46.436
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

19:50.189 --> 19:52.402
YES, YOU JACKASS.

20:05.745 --> 20:06.955
SO YOU WERE REALLY SURPRISED?

20:06.956 --> 20:09.328
YES. THAT WAS VERY SWEET.

20:09.329 --> 20:11.670
AND NEVER DO THAT AGAIN.

20:11.671 --> 20:14.503
WELL, PROPOSING TO YOU THE
RIGHT WAY MEANT A LOT TO ME.

20:14.504 --> 20:17.296
AND YOU KNOW, I MAY ACTUALLY HAVE
ANOTHER LITTLE SURPRISE UP MY SLEEVE.

20:17.297 --> 20:19.548
OH, YEAH? IS THERE ANOTHER
WOBBLY TABLE THAT NEEDS FIXING?

20:19.549 --> 20:21.391
MAYBE.

20:24.604 --> 20:26.606
( jazz music playing )

20:29.729 --> 20:32.731
OH, JOE. IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.153
MAY I HAVE THIS DANCE?

20:35.735 --> 20:37.065
OKAY, SO.

20:37.066 --> 20:39.318
I HAVE ANOTHER SURPRISE FOR YOU.

20:39.319 --> 20:41.159
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

20:41.160 --> 20:43.662
THAT FIRST ONE KIND
OF FINISHED ME OFF.

20:43.663 --> 20:45.824
OH, YEAH? WELL, ARE YOU READY?

20:45.825 --> 20:47.496
BECAUSE HERE IT IS.

20:47.497 --> 20:49.077
I ACCEPT YOUR PROPOSAL.

20:49.078 --> 20:50.459
MY WHAT?

20:50.460 --> 20:53.332
I GOT THE RIGHT GIRL, WHY WAIT?

20:53.333 --> 20:55.424
LET'S GET MARRIED AT THE
ARBORETUM ON THE 23rd.

20:55.425 --> 20:57.006

20:58.047 --> 20:59.338
OH, JOE. I'VE BEEN WAITING

20:59.339 --> 21:01.340
TO HEAR YOU SAY THOSE WORDS.

21:01.341 --> 21:03.722
BUT WHAT IF I TOLD YOU

21:03.723 --> 21:05.724
I LET THE RESERVATION GO?

21:05.725 --> 21:06.885
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

21:06.886 --> 21:08.727
NO, I DIDN'T.

21:08.728 --> 21:11.310
SUCKER! YOU'RE GETTING
MARRIED IN FOUR WEEKS.

21:11.311 --> 21:12.811
SO ARE YOU, BABY.

21:12.812 --> 21:14.232
HOLY CRAP!

21:14.233 --> 21:16.154

21:16.155 --> 21:18.157
I HAVE SO MUCH TO DO!

21:22.902 --> 21:24.784
THAT WAS $400 WELL SPENT.
