WEBVTT

00:00.759 --> 00:02.727
Carroll was convicted in 2004

00:02.838 --> 00:05.022
for the murders
of 14 young women.

00:05.116 --> 00:06.973
All the videos are
on this drive.

00:07.059 --> 00:08.250
Ah. You are
a godsend.

00:08.373 --> 00:09.847
I have to come over more often.

00:09.922 --> 00:11.513
This break-up sex
is hot.

00:11.592 --> 00:12.507
Everyone knows their role?

00:12.595 --> 00:13.821
We trained, sir.
We're ready.

00:13.904 --> 00:16.447
I appreciate
your dedication, Alex.

00:16.657 --> 00:17.475
Don't do this! Joe!

00:17.557 --> 00:18.419
Something happened with Claire,

00:18.502 --> 00:19.300
and now he's gonna kill her.

00:19.391 --> 00:20.889
He's gonna give you the
opportunity to save her.

00:20.965 --> 00:23.428
He's gonna give me the opportunity
to witness her death.

00:23.512 --> 00:25.792
Will you grieve for your
love when she dies?

00:27.566 --> 00:28.150
Aah!

00:28.228 --> 00:29.230
Why does Claire have to die?

00:29.316 --> 00:31.954
It's so that you can be reborn.

00:34.159 --> 00:35.513
Unh!

00:38.193 --> 00:40.370
Joe, this is such a bad idea.

00:40.458 --> 00:41.205
Come on!

00:41.289 --> 00:44.147
Joe! Joe! Aah!

00:46.512 --> 00:47.678
Guys, we got a problem.

00:47.768 --> 00:48.726
Parker's missing.

00:48.816 --> 00:50.071
Any last words, Agent.

00:50.137 --> 00:50.990
You don't have to do this.

00:51.074 --> 00:51.969
Take small breaths.

00:52.060 --> 00:54.287
No! Somebody, help!

00:54.728 --> 00:57.486
Somebody!
Please. Aah!

01:00.435 --> 01:02.121
You guys, I got something.

01:02.280 --> 01:03.519
Surveillance footage
from a gas station

01:03.626 --> 01:04.641
behind the recreation center.

01:04.736 --> 01:06.009
Look at that side road.

01:06.354 --> 01:07.439
It's Parker.

01:09.565 --> 01:11.735
That's the ringleader from
last night right there.

01:13.961 --> 01:15.991
IDed as Alex Lipton,
former army sniper,

01:16.114 --> 01:17.250
part of the Freedom 13.

01:17.368 --> 01:19.057
Another militia boy. Okay.

01:19.195 --> 01:20.809
What else did Joe say?

01:21.160 --> 01:22.902
The attack last night was
"Masque Of The Red Death,"

01:23.012 --> 01:24.559
the girl yesterday
was quoting "Annabel Lee."

01:24.641 --> 01:26.390
About lovers by the ocean.

01:26.522 --> 01:29.276
Joe is playing
to Poe's greatest hits.

01:29.642 --> 01:30.563
He's handing us the clues.

01:30.665 --> 01:31.974
We just need to see them.

01:32.697 --> 01:34.172
What the hell?

01:48.021 --> 01:49.406
I got it, I got it.

01:53.479 --> 01:54.884
Hey, buddy.
What's going on?

01:55.562 --> 01:56.822
What's your name?

02:07.779 --> 02:09.670
Jack Foster.

02:10.372 --> 02:11.790
Where'd you get that mask?

02:11.896 --> 02:13.695
A lady gave it to me.

02:13.977 --> 02:15.502
That lady tell you her name?

02:16.087 --> 02:17.201
Emma.

02:17.297 --> 02:19.394
Emma Hill! Fan out! She
could still be in the area.

02:19.512 --> 02:21.792
She gave me $20 and
told me to put this on

02:21.911 --> 02:22.917
and come over here.

02:23.034 --> 02:24.275
Can I see that?

02:29.729 --> 02:31.027
Phone number.

02:57.955 --> 02:59.576
Hello?

03:00.899 --> 03:01.993
Debra?

03:02.193 --> 03:05.626
Oh, God. Ryan...

03:06.342 --> 03:08.095
Where are you?
We'll come get you.

03:09.803 --> 03:11.347
I don't know.

03:11.846 --> 03:15.021
- I'm in a box.
- What?

03:15.946 --> 03:18.849
It's a... a coffin.

03:20.179 --> 03:22.361
I'm buried, Ryan.

03:23.583 --> 03:25.455
Listen to me.
You hang on,

03:25.612 --> 03:27.590
and we're gonna find you, okay?

03:29.542 --> 03:32.267
Did you hear me? We're gonna
get you out of there.

03:32.771 --> 03:35.523
Please hurry.

They're bouncing the connection
through a dummy server.

03:51.015 --> 03:53.316
All right. Debra,
let's go through this.

03:53.415 --> 03:55.807
I want you to tell us
whatever you remember

03:55.919 --> 03:57.774
after they put you
in the trunk.

03:59.562 --> 04:02.675
I blacked out.
I'm not sure for how long.

04:02.772 --> 04:04.085
At least a few minutes.

04:04.183 --> 04:05.435
And when you woke up?

04:05.787 --> 04:08.031
Um... um...

04:08.505 --> 04:10.171
we went over railroad tracks.

04:10.274 --> 04:11.561
I remember that.

04:11.655 --> 04:13.314
There's one line that
runs through the county.

04:15.256 --> 04:17.867
All right.
Anything else?

04:19.673 --> 04:21.245
We drove for a while.

04:21.519 --> 04:22.912
I counted.

04:23.824 --> 04:25.830
I got almost to 700.

04:25.954 --> 04:27.099
That's a little
over 10 minutes.

04:27.191 --> 04:28.859
Lots of turns. I...

04:32.241 --> 04:34.017
I tried to keep track.

04:35.513 --> 04:36.732
I couldn't.

04:36.852 --> 04:39.871
It's okay.
You're doing great.

04:40.632 --> 04:41.998
Anything else?

04:43.071 --> 04:44.665
At the end,

04:44.763 --> 04:46.676
we turned on to a dirt road.

04:46.782 --> 04:52.016
I could hear gravel or rocks.

04:52.119 --> 04:55.695
We drove for maybe 5 minutes.

04:56.244 --> 04:57.940
Then we stopped.

04:58.062 --> 04:59.807
They opened the trunk.

04:59.932 --> 05:01.117
And what did you see?

05:01.230 --> 05:02.309
Woods.

05:02.418 --> 05:04.888
It was dark.
I couldn't see much.

05:05.035 --> 05:06.401
Two men,

05:07.078 --> 05:09.888
one blond, one dark hair.

05:12.240 --> 05:14.715
They put me inside here.

05:14.856 --> 05:16.680
I could hear their shovels,

05:17.217 --> 05:18.613
then the dirt.

05:21.681 --> 05:24.232
That's all I can remember.

05:25.011 --> 05:27.733
Hey. You did good,
Debra.

05:30.155 --> 05:31.869
We are gonna find you.

05:32.826 --> 05:34.533
Deidre's gonna stay with you.

05:35.855 --> 05:38.061
Debra, I'm here. I'm gonna stay
on the line with you, okay?

05:38.174 --> 05:40.097
There's 8 different railroad
crossings in Milton County.

05:40.212 --> 05:41.432
Okay, but she's to the east,

05:41.532 --> 05:42.732
Cedarville State forest.

05:42.860 --> 05:44.500
It's 3,000 acres.
There's 12 access roads,

05:44.598 --> 05:45.333
they're all gravel.

05:45.444 --> 05:46.443
It's way too much
ground to cover.

05:46.538 --> 05:47.428
How much time do we have?

05:47.553 --> 05:49.622
They abducted her,
traveled by car.

05:49.792 --> 05:51.490
It takes time to bury someone.

05:51.970 --> 05:53.188
How much air do you
think she has?

05:53.290 --> 05:55.904
3-5 hours maybe.

05:57.308 --> 05:58.076
We got to find her.

05:58.192 --> 05:59.068
Police found Alex's car

05:59.163 --> 06:01.329
out on Route 4 near Cedarville.
We're gonna check it out.

06:57.306 --> 06:58.718
Morning, Claire.

06:59.806 --> 07:02.700
Whatever it is
you're considering doing,

07:03.605 --> 07:04.880
don't.

07:06.033 --> 07:07.254
Now come on.

07:08.926 --> 07:10.158
Back inside.

07:29.374 --> 07:31.353
So this is your
ending, a lighthouse?

07:32.704 --> 07:34.998
You don't find that the
least bit predictable?

07:35.634 --> 07:38.367
I... I find it fitting.

07:38.494 --> 07:41.861
- Or predictable.
- It's a motif, Claire.

07:42.036 --> 07:43.229
It bookends the story.

07:43.342 --> 07:44.289
Yeah. You're a brilliant
teacher, Joe,

07:44.416 --> 07:45.866
but it never really
translated to your writing.

07:45.969 --> 07:47.412
- Don't you--
- What? You're gonna kill me?

07:47.529 --> 07:50.058
You're gonna do it anyway.
You might as well just get it over with.

07:54.567 --> 07:55.737
Not just yet, no.

07:55.863 --> 07:57.327
Oh, right.

07:57.454 --> 07:58.983
We're waiting for Ryan.

07:59.074 --> 08:00.284
Yes, we are.

08:00.682 --> 08:03.700
Well, he-- he must
bear witness.

08:03.832 --> 08:07.622
Ryan has-- he has proved
remarkably resilient,

08:07.767 --> 08:11.169
but-- but I do believe
that your death will be the one

08:11.285 --> 08:14.207
that finally does
him in. Heh.

08:14.707 --> 08:16.363
Like I said...

08:17.077 --> 08:18.740
predictable.

08:19.127 --> 08:21.781
You know, you're not being
terribly good company, Claire.

08:21.875 --> 08:24.249
No. I'm finding your
temperament most, um...

08:24.665 --> 08:26.801
most provoking.

08:27.584 --> 08:30.187
In-- in fact, I think I've had
enough of you for the moment.

08:30.280 --> 08:31.495
Come here. Come on.

08:34.547 --> 08:35.496
Unh.

08:36.397 --> 08:37.763
Joe?

08:38.058 --> 08:39.169
Joe!

08:42.611 --> 08:43.703
Aah!

08:56.976 --> 08:58.271
This is definitely the car.

08:58.382 --> 08:59.650
Why leave it behind?

08:59.779 --> 09:02.534
Flat tire. Assuming
after they buried her.

09:02.870 --> 09:03.939
They could be anywhere.

09:04.034 --> 09:06.896
Okay, folks. We need a perimeter
search of the entire area. Let's go!

09:07.005 --> 09:08.493
Mike, check it out.

09:08.685 --> 09:10.041
Tire wall puncture.

09:10.134 --> 09:11.401
Somebody knifed it.

09:12.730 --> 09:14.989
They wanted us
to find this car.

09:25.358 --> 09:26.722
Unh!

09:34.932 --> 09:36.361
All right.

09:37.452 --> 09:39.194
- Give me some cover.
- Wait. What are you gonna do?

09:39.320 --> 09:40.388
Cover!

09:57.129 --> 09:58.415
Drop it!

09:58.895 --> 10:00.011
Drop the weapon.

10:02.405 --> 10:04.418
Where is Agent Parker?

10:05.186 --> 10:06.847
I don't know what
you're talking about.

10:06.988 --> 10:08.353
Hardy!

10:09.303 --> 10:10.198
Cuff him.

10:10.287 --> 10:11.625
Get on your knees!

10:16.807 --> 10:18.151
Put him in our car.

10:20.070 --> 10:21.981
Taking him back
to town for questioning?

10:23.005 --> 10:24.883
Yeah. We got him.

10:27.750 --> 10:29.726
Do what you need to do.

10:31.510 --> 10:33.899
- Who are you?
- My name is Neil Meyer.

10:34.669 --> 10:35.777
How did you end up here?

10:35.888 --> 10:39.598
Couple of kids hired me to
bring a boat up from Newport.

10:40.502 --> 10:41.439
What happened to your leg?

10:41.556 --> 10:42.886
It's my ankle.

10:43.823 --> 10:47.155
I think they broke it
so I couldn't run.

10:47.252 --> 10:48.744
What the hell is going on here?

10:48.829 --> 10:50.477
Who are these people?

10:50.643 --> 10:52.129
It's Joe Carroll.

10:54.928 --> 10:58.244
He's gonna kill us, isn't he?

11:18.421 --> 11:19.755
Where are we?

11:19.840 --> 11:22.505
Just a nice quiet place
where we can talk.

11:25.125 --> 11:26.421
Yeah. I've met some
of your militia friends.

11:26.535 --> 11:28.307
They had this really cool
way of questioning me.

11:28.396 --> 11:29.599
Yeah. I heard
about that.

11:29.676 --> 11:31.237
- Yeah?
- Unh!

11:31.538 --> 11:34.264
Oh. Then you know
what's about to happen.

11:34.497 --> 11:35.894
Here's how it works.

11:36.399 --> 11:38.395
We ask you a question,
you answer truthfully,

11:38.504 --> 11:40.056
or we beat you to a pulp.

11:41.216 --> 11:43.115
Where's Agent Parker?

11:43.440 --> 11:44.461
We don't have time for this.

11:44.571 --> 11:45.665
You need to start talking.

11:45.745 --> 11:47.504
Or what? You're FBI.
You can't do--

11:50.296 --> 11:52.483
I'm sorry.
You were saying?

11:53.473 --> 11:55.550
Where is Agent Parker?

11:55.649 --> 11:57.910
Okay, okay, okay.
I'll tell you.

11:58.012 --> 12:00.609
She's in a coffin
in the ground.

12:02.900 --> 12:04.092
Where is she?
Where is she?!

12:04.270 --> 12:07.374
Go ahead. Kill me.
I'm not talking. Heh heh.

12:07.538 --> 12:08.983
We're not gonna kill you,

12:09.084 --> 12:11.866
but we are gonna get
really, really close.

12:12.297 --> 12:13.983
Aah! Aah!

12:14.204 --> 12:15.706
Aah!

12:16.399 --> 12:18.280
Where is she, huh?

12:20.301 --> 12:21.821
Last chance!
Where?

12:21.932 --> 12:23.270
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
I'll tell you.

12:23.373 --> 12:24.199
Route 32.

12:24.288 --> 12:25.209
Where on 32?

12:25.292 --> 12:27.179
Woods near Macon Street.

12:30.409 --> 12:32.672
Yeah. We got a location.

12:33.064 --> 12:33.837
Got it.

12:33.932 --> 12:36.167
Woods off Route 32,
Macon Street. Go.

12:36.262 --> 12:38.107
- Now, now!
- We're 45 minutes away.

12:38.710 --> 12:41.050
If you're lying,
I will kill you.

12:41.177 --> 12:42.372
Unh!

12:43.493 --> 12:45.244
Get up. Get up!

12:55.898 --> 12:57.672
This won't budge.

12:58.551 --> 12:59.470
Hey. You should sit.

12:59.619 --> 13:01.261
No, no. See, we need to
get you out of here

13:01.398 --> 13:03.274
so you can go
for help, understand?

13:08.553 --> 13:09.997
Come with me.

13:11.759 --> 13:13.008
Where?

13:13.116 --> 13:15.451
In here.
I'm lonely.

13:15.532 --> 13:17.843
Joe, this man needs help.
You don't need him.

13:17.948 --> 13:18.885
You have me.

13:18.978 --> 13:20.568
Oh, do shut up.

13:20.674 --> 13:22.118
You're so bloody noble,

13:22.208 --> 13:23.964
always thinking of others.

13:30.283 --> 13:31.413
Sit down.

13:35.954 --> 13:38.202
Hands. Hands!

13:40.292 --> 13:41.965
What do you need that man for?

13:42.285 --> 13:43.995
You have your boat,
you have me.

13:46.872 --> 13:48.630
Oh. Perhaps
you're right.

13:51.488 --> 13:53.165
I suppose I should
finish him off.

13:53.919 --> 13:57.818
No. Joe, Joe,
you have to stop this!

13:58.202 --> 14:00.351
What if Ryan doesn't make it?

14:01.362 --> 14:05.086
Oh. I left him a-- a pretty
big trail of breadcrumbs

14:05.198 --> 14:08.437
to follow, so--
so I think--

14:08.545 --> 14:10.352
I think he'll make it in time.

14:10.459 --> 14:13.596
Anything to save
the love of his life.

14:17.596 --> 14:19.605
Do you remember, Claire,

14:20.498 --> 14:24.083
when we used to be in love?

14:27.333 --> 14:29.306
That love was a lie, Joe.

14:30.764 --> 14:34.603
W-we were really
good together.

14:47.051 --> 14:50.095
I'm really gonna
miss you, Claire.

14:54.567 --> 14:55.550
Look. My men
on their way,

14:55.666 --> 14:57.254
but they buried her
in the middle of nowhere.

14:57.365 --> 14:58.773
Turner, just hurry.

14:59.031 --> 15:00.007
How much longer?

15:00.733 --> 15:03.158
5 minutes, 10 at most.

15:06.617 --> 15:08.902
Debra, hold on
just one second, okay?

15:09.356 --> 15:11.169
Yes? Ryan!

15:11.657 --> 15:13.598
- How's she doing?
- I have her on the line.

15:14.429 --> 15:15.749
She's scared, Ryan.

15:17.124 --> 15:18.213
Put her on.

15:18.326 --> 15:20.211
Debra, Ryan's on.

15:21.539 --> 15:22.932
Debra?

15:25.826 --> 15:27.462
Debra?

15:29.239 --> 15:33.033
I'm here... Ryan.

15:33.146 --> 15:34.336
Mike's here with me, too.

15:34.443 --> 15:35.359
Hey. We know
where you are.

15:35.456 --> 15:37.087
We're on our way right now.

15:39.444 --> 15:40.987
Can you hear us?

15:41.354 --> 15:42.977
Yes.

15:43.173 --> 15:45.893
I need you to do me a favor.

15:46.804 --> 15:48.799
Call my sister.

15:48.897 --> 15:50.682
Hey. We're
on our way, okay?

15:50.785 --> 15:52.730
Tell her that I love her.

15:53.654 --> 15:57.370
My younger sister Beth.

15:58.128 --> 16:00.741
My parents, too.

16:01.719 --> 16:04.662
She'll know
how to contact them.

16:05.494 --> 16:11.318
We're not close, my family.

16:14.370 --> 16:17.252
That's my only regret.

16:17.399 --> 16:19.358
Deb, we're on our way,
okay, so stop talking.

16:19.468 --> 16:21.926
Just-- just save
your air, right?

16:22.785 --> 16:27.207
Mike... you're a good man.

16:30.116 --> 16:32.227
Don't lose that.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.714
Hey, Deb. Stop, okay?

16:36.822 --> 16:38.486
We're getting
really close, okay?

16:38.597 --> 16:40.020
We're almost there.

16:40.573 --> 16:42.425
And, Ryan,

16:42.779 --> 16:45.146
I chose this life...

16:47.617 --> 16:49.718
the FBI.

16:51.772 --> 16:54.087
I knew the deal,

16:54.193 --> 16:55.708
but this is not on you.

16:55.827 --> 16:58.296
You're g-- you're gonna make it.
You need to hold on.

16:58.637 --> 17:00.768
This is not on you.

17:00.880 --> 17:02.772
Don't you take it.

17:04.041 --> 17:07.064
I am not your fault.

17:09.267 --> 17:10.988
I knew the deal.

17:11.098 --> 17:13.756
Please just hold on.

17:25.875 --> 17:29.685
Please just hold on, Deb.

17:30.226 --> 17:31.871
Mike and I...

17:35.434 --> 17:37.226
We're gonna be there soon.

17:39.449 --> 17:41.258
I know.

18:01.551 --> 18:02.559
Get out!

18:03.522 --> 18:05.495
Where the hell is she?
Where is she?

18:05.608 --> 18:06.799
End of the path.

18:11.536 --> 18:12.855
Get down, get down.

18:19.097 --> 18:20.732
You better hurry.

18:22.667 --> 18:24.098
It's her!

18:24.518 --> 18:25.652
Debra!

18:25.749 --> 18:28.472
Debra! We're here!

18:28.698 --> 18:31.416
Hold on! Hold on!

18:32.269 --> 18:33.362
Hold on!

18:45.573 --> 18:47.901
Here. Get it by the sides right here.
Ready?

18:50.061 --> 18:51.763
1, 2!

18:53.085 --> 18:54.686
Oh, my God.
She's not breathing.

18:55.138 --> 18:56.474
Get her out, get her out.

19:51.373 --> 19:53.652
Aw. That's too bad.

19:53.908 --> 19:55.764
Just a little too late.

19:55.906 --> 19:57.158
Bummer.

20:09.529 --> 20:10.866
Ryan.

20:13.640 --> 20:14.648
Ryan, no!

20:34.555 --> 20:36.429
Come on.
Where are they?

20:56.190 --> 20:58.318
- What is that?
- It's Joe's book,

20:58.737 --> 21:00.079
left in the coffin.

21:02.297 --> 21:04.269
_

21:06.087 --> 21:07.486
_

21:07.596 --> 21:09.231
He planned the whole thing.

21:09.544 --> 21:11.564
It's all part
of this stupid book.

21:13.359 --> 21:15.739
"Ryan prayed that
she was still alive.

21:15.912 --> 21:18.889
He started digging and
finally found the coffin.

21:18.976 --> 21:20.325
Inside, she lay.

21:20.453 --> 21:22.647
He desperately
tried to revive her,

21:22.834 --> 21:25.167
but Ryan was too late,

21:25.272 --> 21:27.260
and Agent Debra
Parker was dead."

21:31.573 --> 21:34.454
He even talks about me
finding this manuscript.

21:34.559 --> 21:36.197
"Hidden inside the
coffin was an envelope."

21:36.280 --> 21:38.158
How would he know exactly
what was gonna happen?

21:38.224 --> 21:39.604
He doesn't.

21:40.474 --> 21:42.218
He says that you died.

21:44.429 --> 21:46.604
Alex shot you in the woods.

21:47.410 --> 21:49.335
In this story, you're dead.

21:50.489 --> 21:53.734
So we can still change
the story, right?

21:54.493 --> 21:57.584
_

21:59.893 --> 22:01.296
What happens?
What's next?

22:02.525 --> 22:05.391
_

22:05.726 --> 22:06.798
Okay.

22:06.910 --> 22:09.449
Ryan, what is it?
What's next?

22:10.271 --> 22:11.318
It doesn't say.

22:11.436 --> 22:13.029
Of course it does.
Ryan!

22:14.301 --> 22:15.907
- Ryan.
- This is for me, alone.

22:16.021 --> 22:17.138
Ryan, you don't get
to do this by yourself.

22:17.237 --> 22:18.164
This is my fight, Mike.

22:18.266 --> 22:20.662
Hey. How can you
say that to me?

22:20.886 --> 22:22.406
You don't think this is
my fight, too?

22:22.505 --> 22:24.105
After what Joe's done,
this is my fight!

22:24.187 --> 22:25.005
He wants you dead.

22:25.099 --> 22:26.596
He wants everybody
close to me dead.

22:26.692 --> 22:28.685
- That was his plan.
- Yeah, but I'm not.

22:29.906 --> 22:31.217
Ryan, we can surprise him.

22:31.318 --> 22:32.269
I can't risk it.

22:32.357 --> 22:34.297
Hey, hey. Ryan,
you don't get to decide!

22:36.583 --> 22:37.806
Stay here.

22:39.111 --> 22:40.055
You're not gonna
shoot me, Ryan.

22:40.137 --> 22:42.029
- I'll shoot you in the leg.
- Ryan.

22:44.512 --> 22:45.824
Sorry, Mike.

22:47.360 --> 22:48.431
Ryan.

23:10.523 --> 23:13.680
When did you know, hmm?

23:14.505 --> 23:15.855
Know what?

23:16.159 --> 23:18.342
That I liked killing things,

23:19.944 --> 23:22.372
young girls and such, yeah?

23:23.516 --> 23:25.802
When did you know? I've always
wondered when you knew.

23:25.931 --> 23:27.575
When you were arrested.

23:27.725 --> 23:32.986
Yeah. You--
you suspected or you knew?

23:33.103 --> 23:36.666
When Ryan came to me,
he told me

23:36.810 --> 23:38.474
about the literary references.

23:40.258 --> 23:41.478
Unh.

23:44.660 --> 23:46.726
- You turned me in.
- No!

23:48.654 --> 23:50.888
He gave me the details
on the victims,

23:51.010 --> 23:54.074
and the saw the--
the symbolism.

23:54.193 --> 23:55.291
I sent him to you.

23:55.388 --> 23:56.850
Oh. Heh.

23:56.946 --> 23:58.128
Well, thanks for that.

23:58.226 --> 24:00.000
I was blinded when
it came to you, Joe.

24:00.105 --> 24:01.448
I...

24:01.927 --> 24:03.698
I loved you.

24:03.803 --> 24:04.780
You were my husband.

24:04.886 --> 24:09.106
Ryan, pitches up with his--
his cocksure swagger,

24:09.214 --> 24:11.946
and you finally face the truth.

24:13.581 --> 24:16.392
So you knew.

24:16.505 --> 24:18.861
- No. No, I didn't.
- Yes.

24:18.976 --> 24:20.376
No. I should have
seen it,

24:20.470 --> 24:21.471
but I didn't know,

24:21.572 --> 24:22.461
and because I didn't see it,

24:22.527 --> 24:23.508
all those girls died.

24:23.614 --> 24:25.542
I should have known,
I should have known

24:25.635 --> 24:26.400
what you were.

24:26.489 --> 24:27.934
Oh, I suppose you should have.

24:33.937 --> 24:35.651
I'm...

24:36.127 --> 24:38.438
I'm sorry. Claire.

24:39.595 --> 24:42.122
That was a horrible
thing to say.

24:42.417 --> 24:44.151
You mustn't blame yourself.

24:44.501 --> 24:47.476
Denial is a powerful thing.

24:48.388 --> 24:50.366
Yes. It runs
very deep,

24:50.477 --> 24:53.455
and it shields us from...

24:54.271 --> 24:56.873
from the worst truths.

24:56.976 --> 24:58.628
No, not me.

24:59.093 --> 25:00.611
I should have seen it.

25:00.714 --> 25:03.180
It was as if I killed
those girls myself.

25:03.290 --> 25:06.010
No. You certainly
did not.

25:06.946 --> 25:10.281
You are the victim
here, Claire.

25:10.639 --> 25:11.885
No.

25:12.280 --> 25:13.409
No.

25:13.599 --> 25:15.447
Ju-ju-just wait.

25:18.478 --> 25:19.321
Please let me go.

25:19.420 --> 25:21.203
- No. Come here.
- Joe.

25:21.344 --> 25:22.861
- I won't tell anyone.
- Shut up!

25:22.980 --> 25:24.215
What are you--
what are you doing?

25:24.902 --> 25:26.657
No talking.

25:27.026 --> 25:28.470
Please.

25:29.192 --> 25:31.338
Aah! Joe!

25:32.017 --> 25:33.332
Back up.

25:45.013 --> 25:48.511
That... Claire...

25:49.454 --> 25:52.838
is what it's like
to actually kill someone.

25:53.354 --> 25:55.749
Do you see the difference now?

25:55.896 --> 26:01.322
You killed no one, Claire,

26:01.473 --> 26:07.703
so don't you dare take
responsibility for my actions.

26:07.821 --> 26:11.542
I earned them, I own them.

26:11.819 --> 26:14.304
They are mine.

26:45.875 --> 26:46.906
_

26:51.726 --> 26:53.994
_

27:06.410 --> 27:08.183
Lose your gun and phone.

27:39.873 --> 27:41.401
Hello, Emma.

27:41.750 --> 27:45.234
Get on your knees,
hands on your head.

27:48.213 --> 27:50.535
Do you think I can't kill you?

27:51.312 --> 27:55.322
I have been instructed
to shoot you, Ryan.

27:56.739 --> 27:58.436
We're not playing
around anymore.

27:58.956 --> 28:00.373
This is it.

28:01.311 --> 28:03.319
If you want to see
Claire again,

28:03.582 --> 28:05.438
this is the only way.

28:06.263 --> 28:08.433
Just tell me where she is.

28:10.109 --> 28:11.294
Unh!

28:22.306 --> 28:24.436
Nice to see you again, Ryan.

28:44.850 --> 28:47.289
Oh, you're awake finally.

28:47.559 --> 28:49.854
Sit down. Sit down!

28:52.179 --> 28:53.978
Gonna need you to be

28:54.261 --> 28:56.858
a lot less combative.

28:56.970 --> 28:58.512
It's okay.

28:58.619 --> 28:59.993
It's gonna be okay.

29:00.090 --> 29:04.125
I knew you'd turn up.
Claire had her doubts.

29:04.955 --> 29:06.613
You found the book?

29:06.967 --> 29:07.892
Of course you
would have noticed

29:08.016 --> 29:10.185
the final chapter is missing.

29:10.300 --> 29:12.435
That's because
we are writing it now.

29:13.126 --> 29:14.224
You and I.

29:14.343 --> 29:16.714
How's it going to end,
Ryan, hmm?

29:16.799 --> 29:18.690
Does good triumph over evil?

29:18.842 --> 29:22.043
Does-- does the hero
rescue the girl?

29:22.148 --> 29:23.728
My hands are tied, Joe.

29:24.729 --> 29:26.625
Doesn't quite make
for a fair fight.

29:26.753 --> 29:30.912
Ryan, I have been stabbed
with both a knife and a fork,

29:31.015 --> 29:35.623
so I really don't think there's
gonna be any more fighting.

29:35.717 --> 29:38.207
Claire, you okay?

29:38.322 --> 29:40.399
Oh, she's fine. Yes.

29:40.512 --> 29:44.277
W-w-we've had a long
chat, Claire and I,

29:44.399 --> 29:45.987
about all sorts of things.

29:46.603 --> 29:51.052
You know, her guilt,
her suffering,

29:51.156 --> 29:54.780
her bad choice in men.

29:54.898 --> 29:56.806
You know, we damaged souls,

29:56.903 --> 30:00.763
we really do attract
one another, don't we?

30:01.573 --> 30:03.905
You're cursed
with a bad picker,

30:04.073 --> 30:05.376
you are.

30:05.553 --> 30:06.760
And let's face it,

30:06.867 --> 30:08.273
why would anyone fall in love

30:08.390 --> 30:09.766
with either of us

30:09.994 --> 30:13.093
total bloody disasters?

30:14.814 --> 30:18.193
We're so much alike.

30:18.303 --> 30:19.700
Your ending, Joe,

30:20.376 --> 30:22.012
tell me about it.

30:23.300 --> 30:25.096
What's my part, huh?

30:25.197 --> 30:26.718
What do I have to do?

30:27.348 --> 30:31.808
Well, you have
to be-- unh--

30:31.913 --> 30:35.302
you have to be
honest here, Ryan.

30:35.413 --> 30:37.424
- You got it.
- Right.

30:38.702 --> 30:42.457
So when did you fall
in love with my wife?

30:45.536 --> 30:48.232
- I don't know.
- Hmm.

30:49.582 --> 30:53.295
When you first met her, Ryan.

30:53.396 --> 30:54.645
Love at first sight.

30:54.734 --> 30:57.680
That's the acceptable answer.

30:57.786 --> 30:59.117
It starts as an attraction,

30:59.213 --> 31:01.242
but later, we're able
to look back on it

31:01.400 --> 31:06.779
and know that we always knew.

31:07.605 --> 31:11.468
Yes. It's much how I regard you
and I as a matter of fact,

31:11.567 --> 31:13.777
love at first sight.

31:15.208 --> 31:17.040
You have to admit...

31:19.049 --> 31:21.061
we're connected.

31:22.660 --> 31:24.233
Not by love.

31:24.360 --> 31:26.751
Ahh. Well, then...

31:27.429 --> 31:31.729
you have yet to truly reflect.

31:33.119 --> 31:38.379
So tell me, hmm,
on this-- this cozy night of--

31:38.517 --> 31:39.433
night of truths,

31:39.543 --> 31:42.143
when did you realize
that I was, uh,

31:42.319 --> 31:44.104
I was the killer?

31:45.200 --> 31:47.080
I started following you.

31:47.190 --> 31:51.196
No, Ryan.
You didn't follow me.

31:51.810 --> 31:56.194
No. You followed Claire.

31:59.450 --> 32:03.312
I followed her to see if
she would lead me to you.

32:05.760 --> 32:09.043
And then you fell
in love with her.

32:11.530 --> 32:13.138
Yeah.

32:19.828 --> 32:21.542
That will make this

32:22.133 --> 32:24.426
all the easier to do.

32:24.937 --> 32:25.851
Let's begin.

32:25.950 --> 32:27.398
- Aah! No!
- Wait! Don't! Don't!

32:27.503 --> 32:30.160
Joe, don't. It's
too predictable.

32:30.274 --> 32:31.280
You got to kill me instead.

32:31.408 --> 32:33.344
That's-- that's not
the ending, Ryan.

32:33.459 --> 32:35.698
No, Joe!
Please, please, Joe.

32:35.808 --> 32:37.850
Shall we start with her eyes?

32:37.956 --> 32:39.179
No. Joe, stop.
Listen!

32:39.286 --> 32:40.350
You got to kill me.

32:40.469 --> 32:41.965
No one's gonna see it coming.

32:44.085 --> 32:45.070
It's the best ending.

32:45.154 --> 32:46.868
I'm the hero.
You can let her go,

32:46.988 --> 32:48.275
but I have got to die.

32:48.375 --> 32:49.716
No one is gonna expect that!

32:49.806 --> 32:52.227
Claire must die, Ryan,

32:52.349 --> 32:54.216
to honor your death curse

32:54.322 --> 32:56.939
because it is by far

32:57.027 --> 32:59.722
the most interesting thing
about you!

32:59.829 --> 33:01.455
It's not gonna work, Joe.

33:01.543 --> 33:03.216
It's overkill.

33:03.309 --> 33:05.596
You're gonna destroy the story.

33:05.707 --> 33:07.486
No one's gonna read that.

33:07.565 --> 33:08.457
It reeks.

33:08.545 --> 33:09.945
You don't even know
good writing.

33:10.089 --> 33:11.464
That's why you're
a teacher, right?

33:11.556 --> 33:14.409
Those that can do, and
those that can't teach.

33:17.922 --> 33:19.986
Listen to you,

33:20.669 --> 33:24.022
trying to get
under my skin. Heh.

33:25.880 --> 33:27.861
Yeah. It's not hard.

33:28.126 --> 33:30.108
See, I know all
the trigger words--

33:31.169 --> 33:36.566
- second-rate, no-talent, wannabe...
- Yeah.

33:36.711 --> 33:40.211
Pretentious, overwrought, flop.

33:44.174 --> 33:46.949
I'm so bored with you.

33:47.453 --> 33:51.287
I'm so bored with you
and Edgar Allan Poe.

33:53.421 --> 33:58.409
What a trumped up piece
of nothing talent he was.

33:58.522 --> 33:59.911
Loser morphine addict

34:00.008 --> 34:02.215
just as pathetic as you.

34:02.483 --> 34:03.986
Aah! Aah!

34:06.688 --> 34:08.007
Go!

34:13.512 --> 34:14.993
- You all right?
- Yes.

34:15.136 --> 34:16.248
Kill him.

34:16.349 --> 34:17.801
Go kill him!

36:08.446 --> 36:09.682
Ryan!

36:57.036 --> 36:58.226
ERT's combing the area.

36:58.344 --> 36:59.487
We got dive teams in the water.

36:59.579 --> 37:00.615
They found partial remains.

37:00.701 --> 37:02.394
Claire mentioned a guy
Neil Meyer.

37:02.504 --> 37:03.923
I want confirmation
that's Joe's body

37:04.024 --> 37:04.962
they're finding.

37:05.061 --> 37:07.416
Well, we won't know until
we run official tests.

37:07.518 --> 37:09.122
Coroner confirmed
a dental match.

37:09.239 --> 37:11.418
Anybody contact
Parker's family yet?

37:11.663 --> 37:13.765
Quantico reached out
to her sister.

37:13.862 --> 37:15.797
I was gonna call once
we got finished up here.

37:15.886 --> 37:17.487
What about the rest
of the followers?

37:17.576 --> 37:19.772
Well, we got 7 total
in custody.

37:21.994 --> 37:24.548
Is he dead?
Did they find the body?

37:24.643 --> 37:26.285
Yeah. What's
left of him.

37:26.370 --> 37:28.199
You're sure. You have
to be sure it's him.

37:28.300 --> 37:29.095
Are you sure?

37:29.206 --> 37:31.316
We'll have official
confirmation soon.

37:32.293 --> 37:34.580
Claire, I have a call for you.

37:34.814 --> 37:36.244
I think you'll want to take it.

37:36.693 --> 37:38.088
Hello?

37:42.492 --> 37:46.225
Hi, Joey.
Hi. It's mommy.

37:46.410 --> 37:49.190
Joey's in DC. The debriefing
will start tomorrow.

37:49.291 --> 37:50.304
I'm gonna take her
back to my place,

37:50.404 --> 37:51.538
and we'll fly down first thing.

37:51.637 --> 37:52.981
I'll send some men with you.

38:04.865 --> 38:06.575
You okay?

38:08.445 --> 38:09.899
No.

38:22.300 --> 38:23.838
Just like the main character

38:23.968 --> 38:26.030
in this novel "The Gothic Sea,"

38:26.176 --> 38:29.505
serial killer Joe Carroll's
life came to an end

38:29.638 --> 38:32.418
early this morning when he was
burned to death in a fire...

38:32.514 --> 38:33.849
Okay. Thanks.

38:34.045 --> 38:35.381
...escape the FBI.

38:35.479 --> 38:37.167
Sources within the Bureau
tell us...

38:37.302 --> 38:38.443
Is it true?

38:38.548 --> 38:41.888
Dental records match,
early DNA.

38:42.344 --> 38:43.643
He's dead.

38:46.571 --> 38:48.275
- Oh. Ahh.
- You okay?

38:48.413 --> 38:51.341
Yeah. I'm just--
I'm a little sore.

38:52.904 --> 38:54.333
I'm fine.

39:15.555 --> 39:16.646
You hungry?

39:16.746 --> 39:19.381
Yeah, I'm starving.
Do you-- do you have food?

39:19.504 --> 39:20.490
- No.
- No.

39:21.091 --> 39:23.158
All right.
I'll get cleaned up.

39:23.779 --> 39:27.698
...Captured Carroll
on the Winslow University campus

39:27.821 --> 39:29.383
10 years ago.

39:29.633 --> 39:32.035
Once again, for those of you
just tuning in,

39:32.137 --> 39:36.321
we have confirmed
that Joe Carroll is dead.

39:36.414 --> 39:38.918
We know that many of Carroll's
followers have been exposed,

39:39.033 --> 39:42.567
leaving his cult of killers
all but dismantled.

39:42.658 --> 39:44.588
These recent developments
leave us with the hope

39:44.680 --> 39:49.049
that Joe Carroll's terror
has finally come to an end.

39:49.181 --> 39:51.450
We will continue to bring you
more on this story

39:51.585 --> 39:53.961
as information
becomes available.

40:17.681 --> 40:20.063
We intercepted this downstairs.

40:20.689 --> 40:22.069
What do I owe you?

40:22.245 --> 40:23.530
It's on us.

40:24.339 --> 40:25.546
Thanks, man.

41:12.837 --> 41:15.143
Unh! Unh!

41:17.938 --> 41:20.553
You were always
my chapter, Ryan.

41:20.645 --> 41:23.753
Joe promised me
I would be the one.

41:28.489 --> 41:30.583
Okay.
I smell food.

41:31.376 --> 41:32.259
Claire!

41:32.371 --> 41:34.676
Ryan! No, no!

41:35.209 --> 41:36.343
No!

41:36.740 --> 41:38.099
Ohh!

41:38.181 --> 41:40.165
No, no!
