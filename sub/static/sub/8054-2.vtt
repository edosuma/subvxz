WEBVTT

00:00.778 --> 00:02.278
I just want to check

00:02.460 --> 00:05.707
one last time that you're okay
about this date with Mark.

00:05.832 --> 00:07.579
I am so fine with it,
Ann, seriously.

00:07.704 --> 00:08.799
It's so fine.

00:08.967 --> 00:10.592
As long as you and I are cool.

00:10.759 --> 00:12.109
You know my code.

00:12.452 --> 00:13.597
Hos before bros.

00:14.421 --> 00:16.056
- Uteruses before duderuses.
- Got it.

00:16.322 --> 00:18.072
Ovaries before brovaries.

00:19.992 --> 00:22.188
- You make such good coffee.
- Look,

00:22.356 --> 00:25.232
I know you're saying you're okay
but I've been in this position before.

00:25.425 --> 00:26.985
And I had a friend who dated an ex,

00:27.483 --> 00:29.988
and I said I was okay,
but I wasn't actually.

00:30.230 --> 00:33.120
- It was kind of weird.
- The thing is, Mark isn't my ex.

00:33.245 --> 00:34.950
We slept together six years ago.

00:35.498 --> 00:37.828
Anyway, I'm over it.
Or am I? I'm just kidding.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.919
This is one
of my greatest brainstorms ever.

00:45.191 --> 00:48.047
A community garden.
Right in the middle of the pit.

00:48.450 --> 00:51.465
We're encouraging people to come out
and plant whatever they want.

00:51.590 --> 00:53.845
And Tom and I sometimes
get here early and help out.

00:54.691 --> 00:56.931
It's so hot.
I had to get some more iced tea.

00:57.436 --> 01:01.018
People have just really embraced this
and planted the coolest stuff.

01:01.419 --> 01:04.631
And Tom is our master horticulturist.
He knows all the scientific names.

01:04.756 --> 01:05.806
Right, Tom?

01:06.235 --> 01:09.318
- Like this. What's this?
- Those are, of course, tomatoes.

01:09.583 --> 01:11.237
Or souljaboy tellems.

01:11.708 --> 01:14.783
Whenever Leslie asks me
for the Latin names of our plants,

01:14.908 --> 01:16.826
I just give her
the names of rappers.

01:17.341 --> 01:19.859
- And those over there?
- Those are some diddies.

01:20.026 --> 01:22.749
There's some bonethugs
and harmoniums right here.

01:22.980 --> 01:25.395
- Growing beautifully.
- Those ludacrises are coming in great.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.194
Look. Someone planted something new.

01:27.319 --> 01:28.419
What's this?

01:29.150 --> 01:30.571
What do you think?
Carrots?

01:30.696 --> 01:33.796
If that's true,
we have a garden pest on our hands.

01:35.127 --> 01:36.373
Some kind of spice?

01:36.498 --> 01:38.372
You know, the best way to figure out

01:38.497 --> 01:41.636
what kind of spice that is,
is roll it up into a joint and smoke it.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.074

02:05.764 --> 02:07.293
Ron, did you get my text?

02:08.454 --> 02:09.794
Did you get my emails?

02:10.318 --> 02:11.927
Did you see that I paged you?

02:12.192 --> 02:13.097
I did not.

02:13.222 --> 02:14.899
Did you check your voicemail?

02:15.602 --> 02:16.451
I didn't.

02:16.576 --> 02:18.370
We have a criminal emergency
on our hands.

02:18.495 --> 02:20.890
Someone planted a gateway drug
in the community garden.

02:21.678 --> 02:24.018
- Call the cops.
- That'll leak to the press.

02:24.549 --> 02:27.646
Then there'll be an investigation. And 
they'll find my fingerprints on the manure.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.912
- And then we'll lose our funding.
- You don't have.

02:30.037 --> 02:32.242
And we never will if this gets out.

02:32.409 --> 02:33.991
Look, I will call the cops,

02:34.116 --> 02:36.447
but give me one day to deal
with this internally, okay?

02:36.948 --> 02:38.365
- Sure.
- Thank you.

02:39.087 --> 02:41.577
And listen, if this thing blows up,

02:42.515 --> 02:43.813
I was never here.

02:48.884 --> 02:50.184
I have a hernia.

02:50.759 --> 02:52.459
I've had it for a while.

02:53.313 --> 02:55.213
And I've been ignoring it...

02:55.872 --> 02:58.740
successfully, but this morning,

03:00.555 --> 03:02.097
I made the mistake of sneezing.

03:06.050 --> 03:07.520
But as long as I sit still

03:07.688 --> 03:09.265
and don't move my head

03:10.535 --> 03:11.535
or torso,

03:13.655 --> 03:15.205
I'm good, I got this.

03:16.338 --> 03:18.292
We need to find out
who we're dealing with.

03:18.417 --> 03:19.657
Who is this kingpin?

03:20.335 --> 03:22.886
It's a 13-year-old kid named Stevie

03:23.011 --> 03:25.066
who likes to get high
and make his transformers

03:25.191 --> 03:26.824
look like they're having sex.

03:26.949 --> 03:30.627
I would like to be president some day,
so, no, I have not smoked marijuana.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.178
I ate a brownie once.

03:33.748 --> 03:35.266
At a party in college.

03:35.433 --> 03:36.683
It was intense.

03:36.993 --> 03:38.998
It was kind of indescribable,
actually.

03:39.289 --> 03:40.678
I felt like I was floating.

03:41.737 --> 03:43.298
Turns out there wasn't any pot in it.

03:43.423 --> 03:45.683
It was just
an insanely good brownie.

03:45.981 --> 03:47.876
You know, if we catch him,

03:48.001 --> 03:50.472
then we avoid a scandal,
'cause we flip the headline.

03:50.597 --> 03:53.233
And it's not "community garden
infested with pot",

03:53.466 --> 03:55.192
it's "brave public servants

03:55.360 --> 03:56.898
"rid neighborhood of drugs,

03:57.023 --> 03:59.405
"earn praise from mayor,
comma, everyone."

03:59.995 --> 04:01.351
We gotta catch this guy.

04:01.518 --> 04:03.518
Get the van, meet me at 7:00.

04:04.949 --> 04:06.399
It's stakeout time.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.376
Get my lunch for me, please.

04:12.544 --> 04:14.128
Okay, like order you something?

04:14.560 --> 04:15.810
No, get it...

04:16.384 --> 04:17.483
from there.

04:18.687 --> 04:20.928
Is this some kind
of weird power trip?

04:21.387 --> 04:22.303
Please.

04:28.847 --> 04:30.645
Thank you.
That'll be all.

04:31.219 --> 04:32.569
You're welcome.

04:44.538 --> 04:47.756
I have stakeout supplies. This is stuff
that we're probably gonna need.

04:47.881 --> 04:49.797
We have notepads,

04:50.478 --> 04:52.082
pencils, and pencil case.

04:52.374 --> 04:54.126
Shakable whipped cream.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.292
Cameras.

04:55.417 --> 04:56.360
Gorp.

04:57.187 --> 04:58.067
And...

04:59.488 --> 05:00.788
candy necklaces.

05:01.984 --> 05:03.438
It's like we're real police.

05:03.605 --> 05:05.617
And I made us a mix CD.

05:06.403 --> 05:09.493
It's all filled with songs
about people watching people.

05:09.660 --> 05:11.060
It's mostly Sting.

05:11.472 --> 05:13.812
- I put our faces on there.
- It's really cool.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.731
Are you gonna wear
that shirt?

05:15.856 --> 05:17.245
Yeah. You like it?

05:17.787 --> 05:18.913
Tommy Hilfiger?

05:19.038 --> 05:22.263
No, Tom Haverford.
I spent 120 bucks to get it monogrammed.

05:22.388 --> 05:23.822
Everyone thinks it's Hilfiger.

05:24.204 --> 05:26.508
You should be wearing
something like this. Take this.

05:26.633 --> 05:29.371
Wear black.
Black is what you wear in a stakeout.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.422
I have to figure out how this works.

05:31.547 --> 05:34.083
- Just let me focus up on this.
- Pretty bummed this fits.

05:34.251 --> 05:36.386
Okay, now we just need
to take a test shot

05:36.553 --> 05:38.671
- and see how this goes.
- Take a test shot. Ready?

05:38.861 --> 05:40.734
- Focus up on the pit. All right.
- Stop.

05:40.859 --> 05:42.595
- Focus up right where the...
- Stop.

05:42.720 --> 05:44.352
Focus up right where the weed...

05:44.477 --> 05:46.011
Stop.
Stop.

05:46.785 --> 05:48.223
Leslie swears it's okay.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.248
So I'm going out with Mark.

05:50.780 --> 05:52.267
I got to get back out there.

05:52.435 --> 05:54.545
When Andy and I used
to go to the movies,

05:54.670 --> 05:57.256
he would always try to guess
the ending of the movie.

05:57.381 --> 05:59.225
And he would always guess

05:59.350 --> 06:02.236
that the main character
had been dead the whole time.

06:03.259 --> 06:05.209
Even when we saw <i>Ratatouille.</i>

06:09.619 --> 06:10.919
Look, it's Mark.

06:14.749 --> 06:15.867
What are you doing?

06:15.992 --> 06:18.856
What? I'm just checking
to make sure this lens works.

06:18.981 --> 06:19.878
Good.

06:26.282 --> 06:27.471
Are you ready?

06:27.596 --> 06:30.050
Oh, no, I need another hour
to get ready.

06:30.217 --> 06:32.684
Seriously? 'Cause I think
the movie starts in like...

06:34.477 --> 06:35.894
You're joking around right now.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.418
This is gonna be fun.

06:38.586 --> 06:40.514
You know, with a body like this,

06:40.639 --> 06:42.589
you don't get the brains too.

06:43.012 --> 06:44.688
That was silly.

06:46.775 --> 06:48.032
Are they dating now?

06:48.200 --> 06:49.571
Brendanawicz is the man.

06:50.035 --> 06:53.117
This is Brendanawicz's life:
hot chick from the newspaper,

06:53.242 --> 06:56.133
hot chick from the post office,
hot chick from the hospital.

06:56.258 --> 06:58.299
Her name's Ann.
You know her name. Her name's Ann.

06:58.424 --> 07:00.378
I'm just saying,
nobody turns him down.

07:01.106 --> 07:02.046
I did.

07:03.632 --> 07:04.536
Yeah, I did.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.805
We were drunk,
and he tried to kiss me,

07:06.930 --> 07:10.934
and I said, "nuh-uh,
no, sir, Mark Brendanawicz.

07:11.374 --> 07:12.848
'I don't need your business here."

07:13.217 --> 07:14.217
Get down!

07:28.402 --> 07:29.406
Working late?

07:44.937 --> 07:46.221
<i>Shovel guitar</i>

07:46.346 --> 07:47.428
<i>Shovel guitar</i>

07:47.595 --> 07:49.886
<i>Somebody wants to play shovel guitar</i>

07:50.464 --> 07:54.014
Leslie's been playing shovel guitar
for about an hour now.

07:54.459 --> 07:55.676
<i>Bucket drum</i>

07:56.450 --> 07:57.601
<i>Bucket drum</i>

07:57.769 --> 08:00.145
- You're not from here, right?
- No, I'm from South Carolina.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.279
But you moved
to South Carolina from where?

08:02.404 --> 08:06.023
- My mother's uterus.
- But you were conceived in Libya?

08:07.779 --> 08:09.871
I was conceived in America.
My parents are Indian.

08:09.996 --> 08:11.804
Where did the name Haverford
come from?

08:11.929 --> 08:13.909
My birth name is...

08:14.077 --> 08:16.196
Darwish Zubair Ismail Gani.

08:16.524 --> 08:18.129
Then I changed it to Tom Haverford

08:18.254 --> 08:21.583
because, you know, brown guys
with funny-sounding Muslim names

08:21.789 --> 08:23.816
don't make it really far
in politics.

08:24.785 --> 08:27.218
- What about Barack Obama?
- Yeah, fine, Barack Obama.

08:27.343 --> 08:31.023
If I knew a dude named Barack Obama
was gonna be elected president,

08:31.148 --> 08:33.595
- Maybe I wouldn't have changed it.
- Did you hear that?

08:34.269 --> 08:35.556
It's the kingpin.

08:36.203 --> 08:37.503
Write this down.

08:39.703 --> 08:42.530
White male, light brown hair.

08:42.740 --> 08:44.190
Just take pictures.

08:44.332 --> 08:46.066
Oh, my God.
It looks like Andy.

08:46.424 --> 08:47.359
That is Andy.

08:48.566 --> 08:49.716
That is Andy.

08:50.304 --> 08:51.804
Andy is the kingpin.

08:53.301 --> 08:54.533
Andy, come here.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.434
Oh, hey, you guys.

08:56.851 --> 08:58.981
What are you doing here?
It's so good to see you.

08:59.106 --> 09:00.539
- Quietly.
- What happened?

09:00.832 --> 09:03.709
- You're living in the pit now?
- For now, yeah. It's awesome.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.476
Somebody planted a garden down there
with fruits and vegetables,

09:06.601 --> 09:09.399
- so I'm getting a lot of vitamins.
- That's our community garden.

09:09.524 --> 09:13.000
Yeah, and someone planted
a whole mess of weed

09:13.125 --> 09:14.303
next to the tomatoes.

09:14.471 --> 09:16.872
Don't look at me.
There's weed down there?

09:16.997 --> 09:18.432
I thought that was 
the tops of carrots.

09:18.600 --> 09:21.233
Right, I know. Listen,
we're on a stakeout, okay?

09:21.358 --> 09:22.827
Why don't you come helping us?

09:22.952 --> 09:25.147
To catch the guy.
You could tell us what you've seen.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.859
I'm supposed to have a rock fight
with this crazy guy.

09:29.936 --> 09:32.362
He's like 20 minutes late.
All right. Let's do it.

09:33.363 --> 09:34.813
Do you live here?

09:38.837 --> 09:40.412
Yeah, do you live here?

09:42.899 --> 09:43.790
Catch.

09:45.727 --> 09:46.960
Yeah, I thought so.

09:47.965 --> 09:50.042
I went home,
but I had this strange feeling

09:50.209 --> 09:52.382
that there was something wrong
with you, so I came back.

09:53.112 --> 09:55.093
It's just a minor medical issue.

09:55.327 --> 09:56.200
AIDS?

09:56.727 --> 09:57.795
No, I'm safe.

09:57.920 --> 09:58.889
Blindness?

10:00.107 --> 10:03.060
Is it like a parasite or a virus
or something you get from a bee?

10:04.437 --> 10:05.562
I have a hernia.

10:05.730 --> 10:08.039
- Do you have syphilis?
- I said it's a hernia.

10:08.164 --> 10:09.208
I know.

10:09.564 --> 10:11.151
It's possible to have two things.

10:11.774 --> 10:13.631
Do you need a ride to the hospital?

10:13.756 --> 10:14.998
Yes, please.

10:16.213 --> 10:19.076
But I rode my bike, so I have to go home
and get my dad's station wagon.

10:20.108 --> 10:21.120
Thank you.

10:28.198 --> 10:31.589
- You still here?
- I wanted to see if you could tell.

10:38.508 --> 10:40.058
Are you still here?

10:40.984 --> 10:42.955
It is really great
to have somebody to talk to.

10:43.080 --> 10:44.309
Man, oh, man.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.061
So how's Ann?
She's doing good?

10:46.249 --> 10:48.700
I miss her so much, it's ridiculous.

10:48.825 --> 10:51.775
- How's she doing?
- Doing good tonight. She's out on a...

10:51.943 --> 10:53.386
Ann is great.

10:54.269 --> 10:55.821
And I bet she really misses you.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.157
I'm gonna need more
if I'm gonna stay up.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.380
- Is that candy?
- It's a necklace made out of candy.

11:01.505 --> 11:03.579
- Want one?
- Oh, all right.

11:03.885 --> 11:06.485
Great. All I've had
is fruits and vegetables...

11:06.652 --> 11:07.852
for weeks now.

11:10.295 --> 11:11.216
Oh, my God.

11:15.127 --> 11:16.970
You know there's a string in there.

11:17.713 --> 11:18.927
Not in this one.

11:19.672 --> 11:23.181
Instant sugar high.
Sugar high. Sugar hit high.

11:23.349 --> 11:24.498
Sugar high. High.

11:26.821 --> 11:27.971
Are you okay?

11:29.104 --> 11:30.633
Sugar slam.

11:30.842 --> 11:33.346
Maybe we should get you 
something more substantial to eat.

11:34.016 --> 11:34.860
I'm in.

11:36.041 --> 11:38.770
Bring me back two cheeseburgers
and a green tea.

11:43.092 --> 11:45.342
Come on.
You got to be kidding me.

11:50.012 --> 11:51.538
So that was fun.

11:51.705 --> 11:53.305
Yeah, it really was.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.881
- Surprisingly fun.
- You know what,

11:56.049 --> 11:58.463
I have been a perfect gentleman
this evening.

11:58.588 --> 11:59.962
In fact, watch this.

12:00.129 --> 12:03.264
I would like you to now please
invite me in for a nightcap.

12:03.473 --> 12:05.680
- Not a chance.
- No. Just watch...

12:05.805 --> 12:07.352
watch what I'm gonna do.

12:07.477 --> 12:08.810
Ask me in for a nightcap.

12:09.076 --> 12:11.237
- Will you come in for a nightcap?
- Yes, I will.

12:11.571 --> 12:12.785
No, no, damn.

12:13.169 --> 12:15.042
Drats, I was gonna plan to not.

12:15.167 --> 12:16.068
Wait.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.193
Look.

12:18.129 --> 12:20.621
That guy's trying
to break into that van.

12:21.367 --> 12:23.617
It does look like
he's breaking into that van.

12:26.659 --> 12:28.132
<i>- 911.</i>
- Hi, there.

12:28.448 --> 12:30.862
So, do you like spy on Ann?

12:31.143 --> 12:32.293
From the pit?

12:35.509 --> 12:37.214
I just like being nearby.

12:37.382 --> 12:39.024
That way if she wants me back,

12:39.149 --> 12:42.746
I could be at her house in two seconds,
before she changes her mind.

12:43.571 --> 12:45.854
I don't really know
how healthy that is.

12:45.979 --> 12:49.393
You aren't even dating anymore.
She might be dating somebody else.

12:50.958 --> 12:52.358
- Is she?
- What?

12:52.606 --> 12:54.440
- Is she dating somebody else?
- What?

12:54.667 --> 12:56.957
- She's dating somebody else?
- I didn't say that.

12:57.082 --> 12:59.236
- Who is she dating?
- Nobody. Mark.

13:00.655 --> 13:01.655
It's cool.

13:01.780 --> 13:02.780
My God!

13:04.575 --> 13:07.048
641 to base style.
I'm at the vehicle now.

13:12.824 --> 13:14.292
How are you doing tonight?

13:14.460 --> 13:16.367
I'm all right, officer.
How are you?

13:16.492 --> 13:17.921
I'm responding to a 911 call

13:18.089 --> 13:20.716
about a suspicious person
breaking into a van.

13:20.925 --> 13:23.141
I need you to step out
and show me some ID.

13:23.308 --> 13:26.367
It's okay, my name's Tom Haverford.
I work for the Parks Department.

13:26.598 --> 13:29.224
I got locked out of the van.
I had to jimmy my way back in.

13:29.392 --> 13:31.810
Why don't you jimmy your way out
and show me some ID?

13:32.856 --> 13:35.611
I just told you my ID,
so what's the crime here?

13:35.886 --> 13:37.324
Parking while Indian?

13:37.609 --> 13:40.817
There's no stereotypes
about Indians sitting in vehicles.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.602
All right, fine.

13:42.906 --> 13:44.306
Here's my ID.

13:46.106 --> 13:47.656
Nice job, Paul Blart.

13:48.261 --> 13:52.186
Why don't you head back to the mall, make 
sure nobody's breaking into lady-foot locker?

13:52.390 --> 13:55.500
I'm very close to placing you
under arrest for disorderly conduct.

13:55.757 --> 13:58.444
- Step out of the van.
- I'll step out of your mama's van.

14:00.238 --> 14:02.459
I didn't do anything!
I'm a city employee.

14:02.584 --> 14:04.176
- Come on!
- Calm down.

14:09.838 --> 14:11.088
Motion sensors.

14:13.011 --> 14:14.011
My God.

14:15.268 --> 14:17.215
Excuse me.
What are you doing?

14:17.509 --> 14:19.593
What happened to the guy
that was in that van?

14:19.718 --> 14:20.737
Cops took him.

14:20.904 --> 14:21.904
What?

14:22.278 --> 14:23.990
- My God.
- Ann and Mark!

14:24.917 --> 14:26.278
It's Ann and Mark.

14:31.647 --> 14:33.914
We caught a criminal.
Do you know about this?

14:34.082 --> 14:35.707
He was breaking into this van,

14:36.287 --> 14:38.001
and they dragged him away.

14:38.230 --> 14:39.712
It was crazy.

14:39.837 --> 14:40.837
Right here.

14:41.005 --> 14:42.297
What are you doing here?

14:45.738 --> 14:48.845
If you could just stop writing for 
a second and focus here, 'cause...

14:49.013 --> 14:50.013
Ma'am.

14:50.138 --> 14:53.012
As I've already told you,
this is a police matter.

14:53.559 --> 14:56.109
It doesn't seem
to matter to the police.

14:57.389 --> 15:00.315
- Nice job with that, but listen...
- Let me ask you a question.

15:00.483 --> 15:02.600
Is it the policy
of the Pawnee Police Department

15:02.725 --> 15:04.986
to arrest people when they try 
to get into their own van?

15:06.083 --> 15:07.767
That's not what happened.

15:07.949 --> 15:09.366
Could you please go home,

15:09.534 --> 15:11.592
get some sleep
and let this matter be resolved?

15:11.717 --> 15:13.134
Let's just go home.

15:13.259 --> 15:14.630
Let's go home.

15:14.755 --> 15:16.512
- No!
- Let's just go home.

15:18.897 --> 15:19.624
Easy.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.196
- Come with me.
- I'd like to come with you.

15:23.321 --> 15:24.990
Your friend, he acted like an ass.

15:25.115 --> 15:26.675
And he didn't give me a choice.

15:27.368 --> 15:29.135
Your name's Dave?
Can I call you Dave?

15:30.330 --> 15:32.764
My mother likes David,
but I'm pretty split on...

15:32.932 --> 15:34.285
I hate to break it to you.

15:34.410 --> 15:35.850
You really stepped in it.

15:36.251 --> 15:37.018
What?

15:37.186 --> 15:39.896
I'm a government employee,
and so is your prisoner.

15:40.206 --> 15:42.232
If I wanted to,
I could get on the horn,

15:42.599 --> 15:44.584
and I could have
Ron Swanson down here.

15:44.709 --> 15:46.069
Kicking down your doors.

15:46.237 --> 15:47.696
That's right, you heard me.

15:52.869 --> 15:54.536
What branch of government
are you in?

15:57.119 --> 15:58.331
Parks and Recreation.

16:00.434 --> 16:01.584
Do I stutter?

16:04.800 --> 16:06.520
It wasn't just his behavior.

16:06.645 --> 16:09.009
I think your friend
might be a pervert.

16:09.177 --> 16:11.540
That's what people think
when they first meet him

16:11.665 --> 16:14.054
- but he's all talk.
- I'm being serious.

16:14.179 --> 16:16.725
We searched the van,
and we found a lot of disturbing things.

16:17.121 --> 16:19.311
Some professional
photography equipment,

16:19.479 --> 16:21.689
and these pictures
of some people on a date.

16:22.004 --> 16:24.704
We also found
an enormous amount of manure,

16:25.002 --> 16:27.389
and a very inappropriate
amount of candy.

16:29.509 --> 16:31.267
Tom and I were in that van together.

16:31.392 --> 16:33.228
We were staking out
the community garden

16:33.353 --> 16:35.251
because somebody
planted marijuana in it.

16:35.376 --> 16:37.037
I brought the candy, a lot of it

16:37.205 --> 16:38.377
because I love it.

16:38.502 --> 16:39.773
I took the pictures.

16:40.848 --> 16:43.502
My best friend was going on a date
with my ex-lover.

16:44.712 --> 16:46.326
It's been a very long night.

16:46.558 --> 16:49.215
But Tom is not a pervert,
and he shouldn't be in jail.

16:51.719 --> 16:54.012
Well, they're gonna release him.
In a little while.

16:54.390 --> 16:55.671
Thank God.

16:56.352 --> 16:58.152
Should I get you home right now?

16:58.277 --> 17:00.977
You two go ahead.
I'm gonna stay here and wait for Tom.

17:01.398 --> 17:03.206
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

17:03.331 --> 17:04.881
Prison changes a man.

17:05.383 --> 17:08.276
I think he'll wanna see a familiar face
when he gets back on the outside.

17:09.009 --> 17:11.369
Well, OK, then.
See you, Leslie.

17:18.537 --> 17:20.872
Yo. I had to wait
till my dad fell asleep

17:21.040 --> 17:22.839
so I could steal his keys.

17:23.117 --> 17:24.125
You ready?

17:24.609 --> 17:26.019
I was born ready.

17:28.622 --> 17:30.321
I'm Ron [beep] Swanson.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.160
Easy. Care...

17:35.711 --> 17:36.711
Careful!

17:42.410 --> 17:44.810
Ann, I really don't think
you should invite me in.

17:44.977 --> 17:47.227
Terrible things happened last time.

17:49.026 --> 17:50.676
So I guess I'll just...

17:51.685 --> 17:53.035
see you tomorrow.

17:55.754 --> 17:56.554
Bye.

17:59.893 --> 18:01.493
You kind of kissed me.

18:01.876 --> 18:04.418
Yes, I did,
and now we both have herpes.

18:05.071 --> 18:06.521
I'll see you later.

18:22.018 --> 18:24.602
- Thanks for waiting. Appreciate it.
- Mother Teresa.

18:25.277 --> 18:28.356
It's not your chocolate.
Don't... get your hands off that.

18:28.616 --> 18:30.043
- Wake up.
- What?

18:30.559 --> 18:32.164
Is this your house?
Where are we?

18:32.289 --> 18:33.570
You're awake?

18:36.833 --> 18:39.242
- Thanks for the coat.
- It's no problem, you can keep it.

18:39.433 --> 18:40.285
Really?

18:41.401 --> 18:44.330
Actually, no.
I need that for my uniform.

18:45.069 --> 18:46.583
But I can give you a ride.

18:48.501 --> 18:49.964
We'll talk about the coat.

18:50.166 --> 18:52.297
- I can't give it to you. Understand?
- OK.

18:54.291 --> 18:56.445
So where's that marijuana at?

18:57.455 --> 18:59.000
It's down in the garden.

18:59.224 --> 19:01.973
Good meeting you, man.
Should grab a drink some time.

19:03.663 --> 19:05.143
I hope Ann and Mark got home okay.

19:05.311 --> 19:08.761
That's all that matters.
That Ann is home, and she's okay.

19:09.118 --> 19:11.567
And that Mark is also okay,
and he is in his home.

19:12.235 --> 19:14.897
Just important that they're both
in their homes.

19:15.022 --> 19:16.237
Mark's an idiot.

19:16.614 --> 19:19.616
You could do a lot better than him.
Forget about him.

19:20.888 --> 19:21.988
Thanks, Tom.

19:23.425 --> 19:26.206
I didn't mean me.
Keep it in your pants, Knope.

19:27.752 --> 19:29.751
I swear to God,
it actually... it was there.

19:29.919 --> 19:31.019
These are...

19:31.494 --> 19:32.494
carrots.

19:33.576 --> 19:36.818
You don't think I know the difference
between carrots and marijuana?

19:39.245 --> 19:41.504
Is that the house there
where your best friend lives?

19:41.629 --> 19:43.172
Where she saw the van from?

19:45.347 --> 19:46.267
I get it.

19:46.435 --> 19:47.236
What?

19:47.468 --> 19:49.229
You wanted to check up
on your friend

19:49.397 --> 19:51.022
and that guy, your ex,

19:51.461 --> 19:55.026
so you made up a story about weed
so you could stake out their date.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.029
I did not.

19:56.154 --> 19:58.321
- There actually was weed here.
- It's okay.

19:59.410 --> 20:01.074
I think it's kind of cute.

20:05.381 --> 20:06.625
I like Miss Knope.

20:06.750 --> 20:07.885
I gotta say

20:08.551 --> 20:10.998
when I first met her,
I didn't care much for her,

20:11.123 --> 20:14.963
because, like 99% of the people
in any given day of my life,

20:15.131 --> 20:16.797
she was very belligerent

20:16.922 --> 20:18.272
and disagreeable.

20:18.551 --> 20:21.699
Miss Knope was attractive to me
as a man.

20:22.340 --> 20:25.809
I was attracted to her
in her demeanor.

20:25.934 --> 20:29.561
I was attracted to her
in a sexual manner that was appropriate.

20:31.775 --> 20:33.606
I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

20:35.766 --> 20:37.953
What a crazy night.
Partner?

20:38.079 --> 20:39.573
Want to go get some breakfast?

20:39.698 --> 20:41.739
What? No.
Take me home.

20:41.907 --> 20:43.308
What is wrong with you?

20:44.786 --> 20:47.453
Oh, my God,
I can't believe this is on!

20:48.778 --> 20:50.600
I wonder if mini golf is open.

20:51.056 --> 20:52.056
Home!

20:55.822 --> 20:57.088
Ann-danawicz,

20:57.482 --> 20:59.630
what are you guys doing?
Eating? Love it.

20:59.808 --> 21:02.092
Just wanted to thank you
for having me arrested

21:02.217 --> 21:04.178
as a pervert the other night.
That was cool.

21:04.346 --> 21:05.207
Peace.

21:05.999 --> 21:08.808
We didn't think you were a pervert.
We thought you were a criminal.

21:10.273 --> 21:13.575
For the record, I still actually
kind of think he's a pervert.
