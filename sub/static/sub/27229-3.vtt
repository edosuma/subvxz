Hey, Kimmy,  we--

01:03.272 --> 01:04.273
Whoa.

01:09.027 --> 01:10.988
Don't judge me. I'm eating for two.

01:13.532 --> 01:14.533
We're both full.

01:15.993 --> 01:19.371
All right,  we've got a serious problem
with the Bernstein birthday party.

01:19.454 --> 01:21.540
The singer canceled.
I can't find another one.

01:21.623 --> 01:25.168
Why don't you play the party?
You've got a kid coming and...

01:25.252 --> 01:27.170
God knows, I don't pay you enough.

01:28.380 --> 01:29.715
A kids' party?

01:29.798 --> 01:33.468
Ooh, can I wear colorful makeup
and some silly costume and walk on stilts?

01:33.552 --> 01:35.554
Yeah. Doesn't that sound like fun?

01:37.347 --> 01:40.309
No. No, that sounds like your wedding
all over again.

01:41.768 --> 01:45.897
I am so tired.
Sharing a bed with you is no picnic.

01:46.481 --> 01:50.652
When are you gonna trim those toenails?
I had a dream I was fighting Wolverine.

01:52.195 --> 01:54.990
Oh, a dream about Hugh Jackman.
I'm so sorry.

01:56.658 --> 01:59.119
I want Dad to move out
so I can get my room back.

01:59.202 --> 02:00.621
Here, drink.

02:00.704 --> 02:03.707
If you're going on <i>Wake Up San Francisco</i>
you got to wake up.

02:06.418 --> 02:08.378
It has it in the title - "wake up."

02:09.171 --> 02:10.380
You need the publicity

02:10.464 --> 02:13.634
since Matt opened his pet clinic
two blocks from yours.

02:13.717 --> 02:18.221
Yeah, he did take a lot of our clients,
even Captain Whiskers and Mrs. Boots.

02:18.305 --> 02:21.099
I delivered their children.
That used to mean something.

02:23.018 --> 02:24.770
Where are the freaking spoons?

02:25.479 --> 02:28.565
"Freaking"? Whoa.
You kiss your podiatrist with that mouth?

02:31.568 --> 02:33.278
Dad reorganized all the drawers.

02:33.362 --> 02:34.446
Again?

02:34.529 --> 02:37.658
Since he retired, all he does is clean
and shop at Costco.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.578
We have more pudding cups
than a nursing home.

02:43.497 --> 02:46.208
I think he's looking
for a way to feel useful.

02:46.291 --> 02:48.669
Yeah. I think he misses being on TV.

02:48.877 --> 02:50.379
What makes you say that?

02:54.383 --> 02:57.302
And we're back. So, Tommy,

02:57.386 --> 03:00.389
some of your fans are dying to know -
what's your favorite color?

03:00.472 --> 03:01.515
Blue.

03:01.598 --> 03:02.933
Blue?

03:03.016 --> 03:05.435
Wow, we happen to have
that color right here.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.646
Can we get a close-up
of the blue, please?

03:08.647 --> 03:09.648
Thank you, Max.

03:11.316 --> 03:12.901
See what I mean?

03:12.984 --> 03:16.446
Aw, I missed his monologue.
That's the best part.

03:18.490 --> 03:21.827
Check it out. I have my first
college counseling session next week.

03:21.910 --> 03:24.204
-Oh, college.
-Aw, college.

03:26.373 --> 03:29.501
Anyway, I listed
my academic achievements,

03:29.584 --> 03:32.462
extracurriculars,
and links to my dance videos.

03:32.546 --> 03:33.922
Impressive.

03:34.798 --> 03:37.509
How about you, Jackson?
What's on your list?

03:37.592 --> 03:39.010
Nothing.

03:39.094 --> 03:41.221
Well, what about the chess club?

03:41.346 --> 03:43.807
They kicked me out
'cause I kept calling it chest.

03:45.809 --> 03:47.144
What am I gonna do?

03:47.227 --> 03:49.187
Well, you have plenty of time.

03:49.438 --> 03:53.024
You can volunteer
or run for Student Council--

03:53.108 --> 03:55.902
Or you can just copy Ramona's list.

03:57.571 --> 03:58.864
That's what I would do.

03:59.823 --> 04:03.493
Not that I'm recommending
that you do that, but you could.

04:08.248 --> 04:11.084
Don't worry, Jackson.
You will find your thing.

04:11.168 --> 04:13.545
You still have three years
of high school left.

04:14.129 --> 04:15.130
At least.

04:17.424 --> 04:20.302
Max, you can't leave.
I need you for the cooking segment.

04:21.636 --> 04:24.097
I... I have to go to school.

04:26.975 --> 04:29.895
Dad, are you sure you don't mind me
being on your old show?

04:29.978 --> 04:31.229
Why would I mind?

04:31.313 --> 04:35.358
Maybe 'cause they hired Becky back
after she turned <i>The Gab</i> into a hit,

04:35.442 --> 04:36.860
but you refused to audition.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.866
Or some totally different reason.

04:45.160 --> 04:48.580
Nope. It, uh...
it doesn't bother me at all.

04:54.252 --> 04:55.962
See? It doesn't bother him at all.

04:58.423 --> 05:01.134
WAKE UP
SAN FRANCISCO

05:01.218 --> 05:04.805
Now remember - just be yourself
and talk to me like you would at home.

05:04.888 --> 05:08.308
Oh, and don't let my neanderthal co-host
make you uncomfortable.

05:08.391 --> 05:10.227
How would he make me uncomfortable?

05:10.310 --> 05:12.312
You must be the hot lady vet.

05:13.522 --> 05:14.856
Woof.

05:18.068 --> 05:19.069
Oh, that's how.

05:20.612 --> 05:22.280
Go away, Ron. Shoo.

05:23.114 --> 05:24.282
Enjoy the view.

05:27.828 --> 05:28.954
Hey, Becky.

05:29.579 --> 05:30.831
Dr. Fuller.

05:30.914 --> 05:33.959
Matt, why are you here? Why is he here?

05:34.042 --> 05:36.461
I don't know. This segment was booked
before I was rehired.

05:36.545 --> 05:40.340
I'm here promoting pet adoption.
We scheduled this when we were partners.

05:40.423 --> 05:43.635
Yeah, and I assumed you'd bow out.

05:43.718 --> 05:46.137
And just let you
get all the free publicity?

05:46.221 --> 05:49.266
Oh, that's a good point.
I'll stay out of it.

05:51.351 --> 05:54.437
I've been working with
this animal rescue for ten years.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.815
And the truth is, we only need one of you.

05:56.898 --> 05:59.693
-Maybe Matt should leave.
-I'm not going anywhere.

05:59.776 --> 06:02.737
Well, I'm not going anywhere, either.

06:03.822 --> 06:06.408

Oh, right. That's his line now.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.921
-Uh-oh. What's Matt doing there?
-...Matt Harmon.

06:20.005 --> 06:22.257
And this handsome guy
is Digby the Dog.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.384
Oh, my goodness. I'm in love.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.845
Well, I am wearing Paco Rabanne.

06:26.928 --> 06:29.764
I consider myself
quite the "colognoisseur."

06:32.100 --> 06:33.560
That's you?

06:33.643 --> 06:35.979
I thought Digby the Dog ate a urinal cake.

06:38.398 --> 06:42.611
Well, Digby's first year vaccinations
will be donated by Fuller Pet Care

06:42.694 --> 06:44.362
so he can stay happy and healthy.

06:45.030 --> 06:48.283
Or... you could bring him
down to Harmon...

06:48.366 --> 06:51.077
Better Pet Care, with me.

06:51.161 --> 06:53.705
I'm Dr. Matt Harmon. I'm six-two.

06:53.788 --> 06:56.666
I like romantic dinners,
long walks on the beach,

06:56.750 --> 06:58.877
and women who can commit.

07:01.087 --> 07:03.673
You wanna do this right now on TV?

07:03.757 --> 07:05.967
Yeah, I kinda do.

I had no idea Matt was still so angry.

07:16.186 --> 07:19.064
It wasn't even his wedding I ruined.
It was yours.

07:20.982 --> 07:24.194
Oh. I should probably mention
that I'm sorry about that.

07:25.820 --> 07:27.906
Hey, let me call you back. Bye, honey.

07:28.740 --> 07:34.037
[Jamaican accent] Oh, there's Dr. Fuller,

07:34.955 --> 07:35.956
Can it, Janet.

07:38.583 --> 07:41.419
-At least it drummed up some business.
-Hah. No.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.880
I think it's these discount coupons.

07:44.714 --> 07:47.258
50% off any service?

07:47.342 --> 07:48.468
I didn't print these.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.346
I think I know who did.

07:52.055 --> 07:53.181
Was it the Russians?

07:57.018 --> 07:58.019
No.

07:58.812 --> 07:59.813
Maybe. No.

08:01.231 --> 08:03.525
Matt is trying to run me out of business.

08:04.317 --> 08:08.279
Hey, everybody, I'm sorry,
but these coupons are counterfeit.

08:08.363 --> 08:09.197

08:09.280 --> 08:10.532
-Oh.
-Oh, my gosh!

Of course, we still offer
our usual low, low prices.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.037

to put on my high-school resume,

08:53.742 --> 08:55.952
so I've decided to do impressions.

08:56.578 --> 08:57.579
Guess who this is.

08:58.621 --> 09:02.333
My fellow Americans,
my name is Barack Obama.

09:05.837 --> 09:06.921

Costco, Dad, again?

09:17.474 --> 09:20.935
You've got a serious problem.
You need to give me the membership card.

09:22.312 --> 09:23.938

09:24.981 --> 09:27.567

Steph, I don't like your tone.

09:28.526 --> 09:31.154
I'm limiting you to just 15 Pop-Tarts.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.407
Okay. Guess who this is.

09:34.949 --> 09:37.118
I'm Grandpa. I don't like your tone.

09:37.202 --> 09:38.536
No more Pop-Tarts for you.

09:41.372 --> 09:43.875
That sounded exactly like Barack Obama.

09:46.961 --> 09:49.506
Hey, Dad, can I ask you a question?

09:49.589 --> 09:51.132
All right - honey.

09:53.843 --> 09:55.553
Dad, are you even listening to me?

Oh, I'm sorry, Steph.

10:00.225 --> 10:03.728
You have my complete attention... honey.

10:03.812 --> 10:07.899
And when I say "honey,"
I mean you, honey, not Costco honey.

10:10.902 --> 10:14.447
Kimmy offered me a chance
to perform at kids' parties, but...

10:14.531 --> 10:19.202
I feel like if I go down the kids' path
that I won't get to be a serious musician.

10:20.745 --> 10:23.289
Long story short,
I've got a kid on the way.

10:24.040 --> 10:28.128
Is it worth putting my dreams on hold
so that I can start making some money?

10:28.920 --> 10:32.048
Steph, you know I believe in you
having your dreams.

10:32.632 --> 10:35.093
But becoming a parent
changes your priorities.

10:35.844 --> 10:39.097
There's no such thing as selling out
when it comes to your kids.

10:39.889 --> 10:42.684
Yeah... I'm starting to get that.
