WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:03.242
ALLISON: Previously on Eureka.

00:03.378 --> 00:04.879
Sheriff Jack Carter,
Tess Fontana.

00:05.005 --> 00:06.245
Tess and I
are old friends.

00:06.381 --> 00:07.917
She's the new head
of Section Five.

00:08.050 --> 00:09.631
It was a radio signal.

00:09.801 --> 00:10.927
Man-made?
No.

00:11.053 --> 00:13.920
I mean, we don't have
anything out that far.

00:14.097 --> 00:15.007
There's something
out there,

00:15.140 --> 00:16.425
and it's heading
straight for us.

00:16.558 --> 00:18.014
General Mansfield
is concerned

00:18.143 --> 00:20.099
that the signal
may not be friendly.

00:20.229 --> 00:22.265
He's ordered me
to prepare
a defense system.

00:27.945 --> 00:31.904
(YAWNING)
Why does morning
have to start so early?

00:32.032 --> 00:33.863
Because someone
stays up too late.

00:33.992 --> 00:34.981
I didn't.

00:35.118 --> 00:36.858
(CHUCKLES) Oh, yeah.
But I had the
weirdest dreams.

00:36.995 --> 00:39.077
You know, like, when
you're trying to finish
a really important test

00:39.206 --> 00:40.195
and you're running
out of time?

00:40.332 --> 00:43.665
I usually dream
about baseball or
global catastrophe.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.376
Or cake.
Wow.

00:48.423 --> 00:50.505
10 and 2.
Keep your hands.

00:50.634 --> 00:51.999
That make you nervous?

00:52.135 --> 00:53.875
(CHUCKLING) Yeah.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.048
What about this?
Hey, hey. Hey!

00:56.181 --> 00:58.137
Or this?
What is your problem?

00:58.267 --> 01:00.929
Relax!
They're upgrading
the network.

01:01.728 --> 01:02.683
The...

01:02.813 --> 01:03.973
The roads?

01:05.148 --> 01:06.524
Self-driving?

01:07.609 --> 01:09.895
Do you even
read your e-mail?

01:10.028 --> 01:11.484
Sometimes.

01:11.613 --> 01:12.989
Smart asphalt.

01:13.574 --> 01:14.734
I beg your pardon?

01:14.866 --> 01:17.903
No, the roads. They're wired
to make the traffic, like,
super efficient.

01:18.036 --> 01:19.242
It's called
smart asphalt.

01:21.164 --> 01:22.904
So now,
they're connecting
the cars to the road,

01:23.041 --> 01:25.874
so the system can
basically drive for you.

01:26.003 --> 01:27.209
(STAMMERING)

01:28.297 --> 01:29.912
(CHUCKLING) Yeah.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.083
CARTER: Whoa!

01:31.216 --> 01:32.251
AUTOMATED MALE VOICE:
Sheriff's Office.

01:32.384 --> 01:34.921
See? We're here,
and I didn't even
have to do anything.

01:35.053 --> 01:37.965
Yeah. Another victory
for total laziness.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.383
Isn't it awesome?

01:39.516 --> 01:41.677
I can sleep all
the way to school.

01:41.810 --> 01:43.220
Yeah, that's what
the world needs.

01:43.353 --> 01:45.560
ls more people
asleep at the wheel.

01:45.689 --> 01:48.021
Do you have
to suck the fun
out of everything?

01:49.443 --> 01:50.523
Yes.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.606
Tesla High, please.
Take your time.

01:53.739 --> 01:55.980
AUTOMATED MALE VOICE:
Destination entered.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.617
(JO CHUCKLING)

01:58.076 --> 02:00.658
Automatic driving.
It's a bad idea.

02:00.787 --> 02:03.199
Anything's better
than a teenager driving,

02:03.332 --> 02:04.321
but don't worry,

02:04.458 --> 02:06.870
it'll take Henry
a while to get
all the cars online.

02:07.002 --> 02:08.412
Well, can you tell
him to skip me?

02:08.545 --> 02:10.501
I prefer to be driving
when I'm driving.

02:10.631 --> 02:15.000
Amen. Especially
when you're driving
something as sweet as

02:15.677 --> 02:16.666
this.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.844
This is yours?
Yeah.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.214
Two hundred
and sixty-five
horsepower,

02:22.351 --> 02:25.388
track-tuned suspension
and all-wheel drive.

02:26.104 --> 02:29.767
Totally high performance,
but completely
under my control.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.361
Kind of like Zane.
What about my new car?

02:33.487 --> 02:35.523
Uh, with your
driving record?

02:35.989 --> 02:36.978
Good luck.

02:37.115 --> 02:40.107
I went through
requisition hell
to get this.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.232
l CC'd you
on everything.

02:41.370 --> 02:42.485
Don't you read
your e-mails?

02:42.621 --> 02:44.577
Yes! Sometimes.

02:45.207 --> 02:47.914
Looky here!
Hot wheels, Jo!

02:48.460 --> 02:51.372
Thanks. Six weeks
on the wait list.

02:52.089 --> 02:54.000
Small price to pay
for awesomeness.

02:54.132 --> 02:57.295
TABITHA: Congratulations
on your new vehicle,
Deputy Lupo.

02:57.427 --> 03:00.885
The Subaru lmpreza WRX
is an excellent choice.

03:01.598 --> 03:04.635
Thank you, Tabitha.
You're looking
pretty good yourself.

03:05.435 --> 03:06.641
(ENGINE DIES)

03:08.647 --> 03:10.808
(ENGINE SPUTTERING)
Are you guys okay?

03:10.941 --> 03:14.650
Yeah, it'sjust
the experimenting, and...

03:15.320 --> 03:17.652
Come on, Tabby.
Don't do this
to me again.

03:17.781 --> 03:18.770
People are watching.

03:18.907 --> 03:21.273
TABITHA: I'm doing
my best, Douglas.
Let's go!

03:21.410 --> 03:23.116
(ENGINE STARTING)

03:24.162 --> 03:24.992
(BACKFIRES)

03:27.290 --> 03:28.996
I hate it when couples
bicker in public.

03:29.126 --> 03:30.457
Want to go
for a ride?
Yeah.

03:30.585 --> 03:32.997
(LAUGHS) She drives
like a rocket.

03:36.007 --> 03:37.918
I didn't hear
anything about a
missile test today.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.712
It's probably
in your e-mail.

03:39.845 --> 03:40.800
(EXPLOSION)

03:40.929 --> 03:42.590
(PEOPLE EXCLAIMING)

03:44.266 --> 03:46.097
Test drive's going
to have to wait.

03:47.018 --> 03:48.144
Yeah.

03:49.855 --> 03:50.935
TESS: No, where
I come from,

03:51.064 --> 03:52.600
it's considered polite
to warn people

03:52.733 --> 03:54.598
before you
detonate a missile
above their heads.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.441
Tess, Dr. Wyman
has my permission

03:56.570 --> 03:59.482
to conduct any test
he deems necessary
for his project.

03:59.614 --> 04:00.990
But thanks for
the etiquette tip.

04:02.117 --> 04:03.903
I'm guessing you heard
the massive explosion.

04:04.035 --> 04:05.411
All right,
please don't start.

04:05.537 --> 04:07.619
Carter, Dr. Wyman,
Planetary Defense.

04:07.998 --> 04:09.738
Hey, nice hoodie.

04:10.125 --> 04:11.285
Jealous?

04:11.418 --> 04:13.454
Dr. Wyman's missile
malfunctioned,

04:13.587 --> 04:16.249
so he followed normal
safety protocols
and aborted the test.

04:16.381 --> 04:18.872
Yeah, by blowing up
an A—311 booster,

04:19.009 --> 04:21.250
which, by the way,
he wasn't even
approved to use.

04:21.386 --> 04:22.421
Oh, so he stole
a missile?

04:22.554 --> 04:25.842
Ah! Borrowed,
from another project.
I left a note.

04:25.974 --> 04:28.716
He has my authority
to use any and all
resources.

04:28.852 --> 04:30.683
Yeah, but he put
the town at risk.

04:30.812 --> 04:31.927
Dr. Blake told me
to get results

04:32.063 --> 04:34.475
so I'm putting everything
including the kitchen sink
in this thing.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.189
Which is leading
to mistakes.

04:36.318 --> 04:37.649
First, the laser
misalignment,

04:37.778 --> 04:40.190
then the leaky
antimatter energy cell.

04:40.322 --> 04:43.029
Al, you're letting
this guy run wild.

04:43.158 --> 04:44.489
I'm doing what
needs to be done.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.116
Dr. Wyman, please
continue your work

04:47.245 --> 04:48.951
as quickly and safely
as possible.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.616
I need your
system online.

04:54.294 --> 04:58.253
So, Planetary Defense?
Do I even need to ask?

04:58.381 --> 05:01.373
The signal that
we've been tracking
is getting stronger.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.918
Meaning closer?
Yes. Whatever it is,

05:05.055 --> 05:07.967
it is going to be here
in 138 hours.

05:09.684 --> 05:10.844
Five-and-a-half days.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.592
Oh! Uh, do you need me
to do anything?

05:12.729 --> 05:14.469
Um, put up traffic
cones? Anything?

05:14.606 --> 05:17.313
Yes. Yes. We should all be
preparing for its arrival.

05:17.442 --> 05:18.773
I am preparing.

05:18.902 --> 05:20.187
You're preparing
for the worst.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.686
You've got a dozen divisions
working on defense weaponry.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.279
Because we are
the only people
in the world

05:24.407 --> 05:26.363
with the technology
to detect it.

05:26.493 --> 05:27.949
General Mansfield
wants it kept that way

05:28.078 --> 05:29.284
until we know what
we're dealing with

05:29.412 --> 05:31.539
so we don't start
a global panic.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.656
This means
being prepared

05:35.627 --> 05:36.992
for anything.

05:38.588 --> 05:39.998
This doesn't sound good.

05:40.590 --> 05:41.921
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

05:42.050 --> 05:43.881
Sheriff's Office,
can you hold please?

05:44.010 --> 05:44.999
Hi. Thanks
for waiting.

05:45.136 --> 05:46.125
Uh-huh.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.462
Why would someone
want to steal
your doorbell?

05:49.516 --> 05:50.631
Busy?

05:51.017 --> 05:53.053
No. I'm not making fun.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.434
Well,
could you describe
your doorbell?

05:56.022 --> 05:56.977
Uh-huh.

05:57.107 --> 05:58.096
Okay.

05:58.942 --> 06:00.978
What's Ranger Tom
calling six times about?

06:01.111 --> 06:02.976
Somebody steal
a tree?

06:03.113 --> 06:04.603
I wrote it down.

06:05.991 --> 06:07.481
"Something weird."

06:08.076 --> 06:10.158
Okay. Thanks.
Listen, he didn't
go into detail.

06:10.287 --> 06:11.902
The phone's been
ringing off the hook.

06:12.038 --> 06:13.414
Stuff's
been going missing
all over town.

06:14.165 --> 06:18.579
Yeah, a parking meter,
a weather vane,

06:18.712 --> 06:21.419
475 feet of
Christmas lights!

06:22.048 --> 06:23.163
Oh, and your, uh...

06:23.758 --> 06:24.747
Your desk chair.

06:25.093 --> 06:26.003
(GROANS)

06:27.012 --> 06:28.843
You okay there,
Shenﬁ?

06:28.972 --> 06:31.008
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:32.350 --> 06:33.635
I think I need
a new chair.

06:33.768 --> 06:36.054
Oh, you should try
one of those yoga balls.

06:36.187 --> 06:38.098
Your back will totally
say thank-you.

06:39.149 --> 06:40.184
You... Okay.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.062
You want to tell me
what you think
is so weird?

06:43.194 --> 06:45.059
Probably better
I just show you.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.401
Maybe the most
disturbing thing?

06:52.537 --> 06:54.493
It wasn't here yesterday.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.962
Is that my chair?

07:13.183 --> 07:14.923
(WHISTLES)

07:20.023 --> 07:22.139
You don't see this
every day.

07:40.835 --> 07:42.416
TESS: This is amazing!

07:42.545 --> 07:45.912
Yeah. I never really
got modern art.

07:46.049 --> 07:47.880
It's not art.

07:48.009 --> 07:49.089
This looks like
the base structure

07:49.219 --> 07:50.550
of a toroidal
vacuum chamber.

07:51.429 --> 07:54.091
You know, this
could be the outline for
a magnetic mirror field.

07:55.058 --> 07:57.140
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But...

07:57.268 --> 08:00.431
I mean, this looks
like a pile of crap.

08:00.563 --> 08:02.064
(SCOFFS)
A pile of crap

08:02.190 --> 08:04.476
that someone is turning
into a plasma generator.

08:04.609 --> 08:06.145
A honking big one.

08:06.277 --> 08:10.065
And, generally speaking,
what does a plasma generator
generate?

08:10.865 --> 08:11.945
And don't say plasma.

08:12.075 --> 08:15.363
Uh, bursts of energy.
Short and really intense.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.986
The question is,
what's it designed
to power?

08:18.123 --> 08:20.034
I'll run some
displacement scans.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.543
Okay, let's do an EV
field analysis, too.

08:26.589 --> 08:29.581
So, who do we know
that can build
one of these things

08:29.718 --> 08:32.926
out of a lava lamp
and a kitchen sink?

08:38.393 --> 08:41.180
Uh, yeah. Can it
power a weapon?

08:42.063 --> 08:42.973
Sure could.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.017
Well?

08:49.154 --> 08:52.237
It looks like a cracked
engine block, but...

08:52.991 --> 08:53.980
Let's see.

08:54.117 --> 08:57.860
I'm a little backed up
with the smart asphalt
sensor upgrade,

08:57.996 --> 09:00.408
but I think I can
have her fixed, what,
by the end of the week?

09:00.540 --> 09:02.496
Yeah, I don't think so.

09:02.625 --> 09:06.743
Fargo, she's okay.
I mean, Tabitha's AI is
in perfect condition.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.292
She just needs a little
TLC. That's all.

09:09.424 --> 09:10.664
Yeah, well, so do I.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.257
TABITHA: Maybe Dr. Deacon
could install massaging seats.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.671
That's not what...

09:15.388 --> 09:17.219
Look, Tabby,

09:17.766 --> 09:21.224
we've had a good run,
but there's a new problem
every week, and...

09:22.312 --> 09:24.769
This just isn't
working anymore.
I'm sorry.

09:25.774 --> 09:28.140
Fargo!
He's just upset.

09:28.777 --> 09:30.187
He'll be back.

09:35.116 --> 09:36.356
Won't he?

09:45.001 --> 09:45.956
(HORN HONKING)

09:46.086 --> 09:48.452
Afternoon, Deputy.
You like?

09:48.588 --> 09:50.374
I waited six weeks.
How did you get...

09:50.507 --> 09:52.839
Oh, pulled some strings
with my buddy
in requisitions.

09:52.967 --> 09:53.922
Awesome, huh?

09:54.052 --> 09:55.963
(SIGHS) Well,
what happened to Tabitha?

09:56.096 --> 09:57.677
I thought you loved
that car.

09:57.806 --> 10:00.013
Well, it was nice
while it lasted,

10:00.141 --> 10:02.848
but yeah,
it's time to move on.

10:02.977 --> 10:05.354
Mmm-hmm. So you
just dumped her?

10:06.147 --> 10:07.728
I don't believe
in long goodbyes.

10:07.857 --> 10:10.974
Especially when
something this sweet
comes along.

10:11.402 --> 10:13.484
Men.
Besides, I found
her someone new.

10:13.613 --> 10:14.602
(BRAKES SQUEALING)

10:17.367 --> 10:19.278
Hey, Larry!

10:19.994 --> 10:21.074
They're perfect
for each other.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.157
Yeah.

10:27.752 --> 10:28.992
I don't think
that it's possible

10:29.129 --> 10:30.994
to build a working
plasma generator

10:31.131 --> 10:33.372
out of aluminum
Christmas trees
and duct tape.

10:33.508 --> 10:35.669
Yeah, well, that's what
it looks like to me.
And I'm pretty smart.

10:35.802 --> 10:36.757
And if she's right,

10:36.886 --> 10:38.592
then it means
that someone at
G.D. is building it.

10:38.721 --> 10:40.131
Well, I checked
the equipment list

10:40.265 --> 10:41.846
for every lab in
particle physics,

10:41.975 --> 10:44.136
astrophysics and
condensed matter.

10:44.269 --> 10:46.351
No project
needs a generator
that powerful.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.595
Well, what about
the Department of
Planetary Defense?

10:48.731 --> 10:50.437
Dr. Wyman has
all the resources

10:50.567 --> 10:52.432
that he needs
for his work
right here.

10:52.569 --> 10:55.777
Why would he build
a plasma generator in
the woods out ofjunk?

10:55.905 --> 10:57.156
I don't know.
Maybe he likes
to recycle.

10:57.282 --> 10:59.614
Well, look,
that kind of device
could be a good power source

10:59.742 --> 11:01.278
for a land-based
energy beam.

11:01.411 --> 11:03.276
It could vaporize
an incoming craft

11:03.413 --> 11:05.278
if you were preparing
for the worst.

11:06.082 --> 11:07.947
Iwill talkto him,
but I am telling you

11:08.084 --> 11:10.075
that it is
a waste of time.

11:10.211 --> 11:12.167
And we don't have
much of it left.

11:15.341 --> 11:17.923
Looks like Wyman's
not the only one
under a lot of pressure.

11:18.052 --> 11:20.384
Yeah. Tell me about it.

11:21.806 --> 11:22.886
Where are you
going?

11:23.016 --> 11:24.881
Well, they're still
building it, right?

11:25.018 --> 11:26.883
So someone's going
to want it finished.

11:27.687 --> 11:28.767
Sorry.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.654
Tabitha, what are
you doing here?

11:47.790 --> 11:50.406
I guess Larry
changed his mind.

11:51.252 --> 11:53.117
Oh, he did, did he?

12:02.972 --> 12:04.007
(YELPS)

12:05.099 --> 12:06.134
TABITHA: Be careful,
Douglas.

12:06.267 --> 12:09.430
When you're angry,
you often say
things you regret.

12:11.022 --> 12:13.104
Hey, hose clamp,
not funny!

12:13.233 --> 12:14.643
What are you
doing here?

12:14.776 --> 12:15.856
Conscience get
the better of you?

12:15.985 --> 12:17.441
Conscience had
nothing to do with it.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.947
We had a deal.
No take-backsies!

12:20.573 --> 12:21.653
Thanks for
picking her up for me,

12:21.783 --> 12:24.240
but you sold me
a bill of goods.

12:24.369 --> 12:27.702
The stereo only plays
'80s rock, the AC
smells like feet

12:27.830 --> 12:28.910
and it only drives
in reverse.

12:29.040 --> 12:31.201
What are you talking about?
She works fine for me!

12:31.334 --> 12:33.165
Then you two
should be very
happy together.

12:33.294 --> 12:34.830
I want my refund in cash.

12:34.963 --> 12:37.079
No way. I moved on
to greener pastures.

12:37.215 --> 12:38.671
We had a deal.

12:39.008 --> 12:40.259
She's your problem now.

12:40.385 --> 12:41.374
(STAMMERS)

12:43.554 --> 12:45.294
Don't think this is over!

12:58.903 --> 13:00.109
(EXHALES)

13:00.738 --> 13:01.853

13:03.032 --> 13:04.442
(CHUCKLING) No!

13:06.869 --> 13:07.858
(INAUDIBLE)

13:09.080 --> 13:09.944
Yes.

13:19.716 --> 13:21.331
Stakeouts are fun.

13:23.261 --> 13:26.128
They're more fun
with pepperoni

13:26.264 --> 13:28.596
than with organic tofu,
by the way.

13:28.725 --> 13:30.966
You mean,
"Thank you for the pizza."

13:31.102 --> 13:32.342
That is "Thank you
for the pizza."

13:32.478 --> 13:33.763
You're welcome.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.596
Mmm! You want
anything else?

13:37.150 --> 13:40.734
I've got a protein bar,
juice box...

(GASPS)

13:43.031 --> 13:43.941
Funyuns.

13:44.073 --> 13:45.904
You always
eat this much?

13:46.034 --> 13:48.275
You always this smooth
with the ladies?

13:49.579 --> 13:50.694
Yeah.

13:53.207 --> 13:56.290
So when do you think
Dr. Planetary Defense
is going to show up?

13:58.004 --> 13:59.619
Actually, I don't.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.917
Well, then why
are we here?

14:02.050 --> 14:05.008
Oh, I think somebody's
building this thing,
but I don't think it's him.

14:05.136 --> 14:06.091
I mean, like Allison said,

14:06.220 --> 14:09.087
he has all of
Global's resources
at his disposal, so...

14:09.223 --> 14:12.010
Okay, well, she could
be protecting him, too.

14:13.144 --> 14:15.977
Yeah. She could be.

14:16.731 --> 14:17.937
But, um...

14:20.026 --> 14:21.562
I don't know. I...

14:22.570 --> 14:25.687
She's been under
a lot of stress
lately, I think.

14:26.616 --> 14:29.153
That's very considerate
of you, Carter.

14:30.036 --> 14:32.152
No wonder
she likes you so much.

14:33.539 --> 14:36.906
(LOW HUMMING)

14:37.043 --> 14:38.203
You hear that?

14:38.336 --> 14:39.872
(GASPS) Whoa.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.429
CARTER: Lucas!

14:53.226 --> 14:55.933
He's my
daughter's boyfriend.

14:56.854 --> 14:57.969
He brought company.

14:59.315 --> 15:00.430
Yeah.

15:02.026 --> 15:06.190
This is who's
building it? A bunch
of sleepwalking kids?

15:07.407 --> 15:10.899
It's like they're
all in some sort
of aphasic trance.

15:14.956 --> 15:16.036
Zoe!

15:36.269 --> 15:38.225
Thank you.
You're welcome.

15:39.105 --> 15:40.936
So, the nurse come by?

15:41.107 --> 15:42.688
Oh, yeah.
She came by.

15:42.817 --> 15:45.103
I don't think I have
any blood left.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.984
So they said that I was
building something?

15:50.950 --> 15:52.065
Yeah.

15:53.119 --> 15:56.577
Yeah.
You ready to tell me
what you remember?

15:58.374 --> 16:02.333
Um, I remember
washing my face,

16:02.879 --> 16:06.292
going to bed,
and I woke up here.

16:09.093 --> 16:10.208
Okay.

16:11.637 --> 16:14.970
Well, to help you fill in
some of the blanks,

16:17.685 --> 16:19.095
I brought you here.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.311
You fought me
the whole way.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.271
You were pretty upset.

16:25.610 --> 16:28.226
And then you just
fell asleep in the car.

16:28.988 --> 16:32.856
And I was really walking
around the woods with
Lucas and everyone?

16:32.992 --> 16:34.107
Yeah.

16:34.702 --> 16:38.615
It was like
Village of the Damned.

16:41.542 --> 16:42.622
Wow.

16:44.378 --> 16:45.993
I mean, it could be
a lot of things, Jack.

16:46.130 --> 16:47.631
I mean, a virus in
the myelin sheath

16:47.757 --> 16:49.167
has been known to
affect the forebrain

16:49.300 --> 16:51.006
and cause
group hallucinations.

16:51.135 --> 16:52.341
Well, I've had
a lot of viruses,
but none of them

16:52.470 --> 16:55.337
that ever made me
build junk towers
in my sleep.

16:55.473 --> 16:57.134
I don't know of any
infectious agent

16:57.266 --> 17:00.178
that could cause
this kind of
coordinated obsession.

17:00.311 --> 17:02.643
Well, could
Dr. Suenos be involved?

17:02.772 --> 17:05.889
No. Dr. Suenos has been
doing research on a
zero-gravity mattress

17:06.025 --> 17:07.936
on a space station
for the last year.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.855
Well, something's
got to be affecting
these kids, though.

17:09.987 --> 17:13.150
It could be a thousand things
that affect brain chemistry.

17:13.282 --> 17:17.867
A tuned microwave beam,
gamma radiation,
a radio signal.

17:17.995 --> 17:21.863
Could any of those things
have anything to do
with Planetary Defense?

17:21.999 --> 17:24.376
Possibly. But, you know,
that's Allison's baby,
and...

17:24.502 --> 17:26.743
Yeah.
So I'm discovering.

17:29.215 --> 17:30.796
Brain scans
on the kids.

17:30.925 --> 17:33.917
I'm seeing some
unexplained activity.

17:35.012 --> 17:37.003
Like, dangerous activity?

17:38.516 --> 17:40.256
Activity that I'm
concerned about.

18:01.122 --> 18:02.658
The kids are in
a lot of trouble.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.872
Tell me
this isn't one
of your projects.

18:05.001 --> 18:05.865
Carter, of course
it isn't.

18:06.002 --> 18:07.412
I would never put
our kids at risk.

18:07.545 --> 18:09.160
No. Not on purpose,

18:09.297 --> 18:12.209
but around here,
a lot of things
happen by accident.

18:12.341 --> 18:14.548
Well, I'm about
to fix the accident.

18:14.677 --> 18:15.837
You order
the wrecking crew,
Dr. Blake?

18:15.970 --> 18:18.336
Yes. I want these towers
completely dismantled.

18:18.472 --> 18:19.678
Yes, ma'am.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.680
Whoa! Whoa! Hold up!

18:21.809 --> 18:24.016
Zane, it's okay.
I told them to
take them down.

18:24.145 --> 18:25.510
Sure. Yeah.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.637
A little antimatter
explosion never
hurt anyone.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.889

You told me it was
a plasma generator.

18:30.026 --> 18:31.015
Yeah. It was.

it's a new ball game now.

18:36.657 --> 18:39.899
I have been running scans
on the new pieces
of the machine.

18:40.036 --> 18:43.824
I think this could be
the trigger device to
an antimatter bomb.

18:43.956 --> 18:44.911
Are you sure?

18:45.041 --> 18:46.326
Well, no.

out of baling wire
and bubblegum,

and we start pulling
pieces off this thing,

18:52.757 --> 18:54.463
we can set it off.

get these teams
out of here.

around the clock
until we get some answers.

taken better care
of Tabitha

was the last time
you rotated her tires?

increasing all day.

anything like it.

as they get tired?

is more susceptible
to suggestion

But it's spreading.

22:53.789 --> 22:57.407
The thing is
way more complex,
and, oh, it's humming.

22:58.294 --> 23:00.125
The original
plasma generator

23:00.254 --> 23:02.745
has been networked
to a dozen new components.

23:02.882 --> 23:05.339
Well, it's affecting
more people now.
Why those people?

23:05.467 --> 23:06.843
Also, it's only
happening at night.

23:06.969 --> 23:08.459
That can't be
a coincidence.

23:08.596 --> 23:11.008
Lunar cycles affect
sleeping patterns.

23:11.140 --> 23:12.880
Henry, let's re-task
the geo satellites

23:13.017 --> 23:14.882
to measure for abnormal
gravitational pull.

23:15.019 --> 23:16.850
Any data that
you can get.
Good.

23:16.979 --> 23:19.345
All right, and what
we need to do is tear
that thing down, and now.

23:19.481 --> 23:22.063
Wait, so if you don't
understand it,
just destroy it?

23:22.192 --> 23:24.808
Well, it could be
turning the whole town
into zombies.

23:24.945 --> 23:26.651
No, it can't be.
The ring wasn't here

23:26.822 --> 23:27.982
before the kids
were affected.

23:28.115 --> 23:29.651
They built it,
right?

23:29.783 --> 23:31.910
Yeah, and since they have,
the effects gotten worse.

23:32.036 --> 23:34.618
Listen, Carter,
if they're connected
to this thing,

23:34.747 --> 23:36.203
we need to know
what we're dealing with

23:36.332 --> 23:37.947
so we don't
make this worse.

23:38.083 --> 23:41.667
The trance effect
wanes during the day,
so we have a few hours.

23:41.795 --> 23:44.832
Let's have Fargo and Henry
finish their scans,

23:44.965 --> 23:46.501
then we'll decide
what to do.

23:47.051 --> 23:48.040
Right.

23:49.094 --> 23:50.504
Okay.
Okay.

24:14.119 --> 24:16.986

24:18.958 --> 24:19.993
No.

24:22.503 --> 24:24.459

feeling it.

24:31.929 --> 24:35.171
(BEEPING RAPIDLY)

24:35.307 --> 24:38.049
But I am feeling this.
I don't believe it.

24:39.645 --> 24:41.226
Yes, get me
Dr. Blake.

24:42.106 --> 24:44.518
Well, then find her!
This is urgent.

24:45.025 --> 24:48.893
I'm sorry. Yes, I know.
I should watch my tone.
It's just...

24:49.029 --> 24:50.235

wrong with you?

24:59.790 --> 25:01.997
Didn't Jo talk to you
about stalking?

25:43.042 --> 25:45.124

a lumberjack. Zoe?

25:46.336 --> 25:47.792
She's good.

25:49.256 --> 25:51.417
She's exhausted.
They all are.

25:51.550 --> 25:54.292
Yeah.
First the teens,
now the adults.

25:54.428 --> 25:55.838
Did you find
a link?

25:55.971 --> 25:57.381
I was
cross-checking names.
It's all random.

25:57.514 --> 25:58.845
Men, women,
young, old.

25:58.974 --> 26:01.306
No specific
field of research.

26:02.352 --> 26:03.888
Well, keep trying.

26:04.021 --> 26:04.931
Yeah.

26:05.647 --> 26:07.854
Hey, why don't you
go get a coffee?
I can watch her.

26:07.983 --> 26:09.974
No, I'm good.

26:10.110 --> 26:11.099
Yeah.

26:11.236 --> 26:13.397
You know,
someone's got to do
the sheriffing.

26:13.530 --> 26:16.397
(CHUCKLES) Trust me,
all the drama's in here.

26:16.533 --> 26:20.117
Traffic's so smooth,
I found myself hoping
for a high-speed chase.

26:21.121 --> 26:23.077
Yeah, I guess
that road network's
taken all the fun

26:23.207 --> 26:24.913
out of eluding
the police.

26:25.042 --> 26:27.909
Oh, seriously.
Everyone's driving
around on autopilot.

26:28.045 --> 26:30.627
I may never write
a ticket again.

26:33.675 --> 26:35.176
On autopilot?

26:35.302 --> 26:36.417
Yeah.

26:38.138 --> 26:40.129
Jo did a background check
on all of the builders,

26:40.265 --> 26:41.801
and every single one
of them

26:41.934 --> 26:43.970
has had their car
networked with
the smart asphalt.

26:44.103 --> 26:44.933
So instead of
driving cars,

26:45.062 --> 26:47.223
you think the network
is driving people.
Yes, exactly.

26:47.356 --> 26:49.688
Well, if that's true,
why's it only
affecting the teens?

26:49.817 --> 26:51.773
Because we
upgraded the cars
to the smart asphalt

26:51.902 --> 26:53.688
in order of
accident statistics.

26:53.821 --> 26:55.652
And teens are the most
dangerous drivers.

26:55.781 --> 26:57.897
And that explains
Zane, too. He's
a terror.

26:58.033 --> 26:59.989
Well, Zane is
also the architect
of the system.

27:00.119 --> 27:02.701
Maybe he could help us,
if he wakes up.

27:03.872 --> 27:05.408
Yeah, but we
don't have time.

27:05.541 --> 27:07.452
I mean,
we have to shut
the grid down now.

27:07.584 --> 27:10.826

would be me, Douglas.

she was!

27:55.966 --> 27:57.422

is on my pink slip anymore.

28:00.429 --> 28:01.760
(STAMMERING)
Uh, mine is.

28:01.889 --> 28:03.345
Tabitha, pull over now.

28:03.473 --> 28:04.679
Shut up, Larry.

28:04.808 --> 28:05.888
Huh?

28:07.895 --> 28:09.977
Where are you taking us?

28:10.105 --> 28:12.847
Tabby? Sweetheart?

28:13.400 --> 28:16.813
Not so pleasant
having your destiny in
someone else's hands, is it?

28:16.945 --> 28:18.901
You don't have hands!

28:22.993 --> 28:26.156
Jack, before we shut down
the grid, you should know
that there are risks.

28:26.288 --> 28:28.153
Yeah, I know.
Traffic jams.
I'll handle it.

28:28.290 --> 28:30.827
No, he means
for the people
connected to it.

28:30.959 --> 28:32.574
Shutting down
the grid could
be the answer,

28:32.711 --> 28:34.542
but it could cause
adverse effects.

28:34.671 --> 28:37.287
So you may
want to be with Zoe
when we do this.

28:38.008 --> 28:39.464

I don't know yet,
but the teenagers
are more severe,

30:44.259 --> 30:46.750
possibly
because they were
affected first,

30:46.887 --> 30:49.845
and all the others
are in and out.

to turn off the road

31:05.781 --> 31:08.818

sophisticated enough

to control
a human brain.

Well, given that it's been
controlling your brain,
how can you be so sure?

that the system
was interacting

with whatever
is doing this
to all of you.

31:19.836 --> 31:23.499
Um, it's possible that
the smart asphalt sensors

31:23.632 --> 31:25.623
crossed frequencies
with something else.

31:26.635 --> 31:28.796

And why at night?

31:28.929 --> 31:30.385
Well, possibly a broadcast.

31:30.514 --> 31:33.256

would be stronger
because the sun's down.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.599

amplified the power.

31:35.727 --> 31:38.560
But we chose
an encrypted frequency
for the road network

any interference from
a local source signal.

34:09.548 --> 34:11.584
It wanted us
to build that device.

34:11.716 --> 34:14.128
And we have no idea
what it's capable of doing.

34:15.095 --> 34:18.053
I'm going to tell Wyman
to spin up Eureka's
planetary defense grid.

34:18.181 --> 34:19.136
Wait, you're going
to shoot it down?

34:19.266 --> 34:20.426
No. I'm just
loading the gun.

34:20.559 --> 34:23.596
We have no idea what
it's doing to us and why,
and we need to be prepared.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.514
Allison, you know
that could just
be a function

34:25.647 --> 34:27.638
of our inability to
receive the information.

34:27.774 --> 34:29.856
Don't let
all this technology
fool you.

34:29.985 --> 34:32.067
We're still very
primitive creatures.

34:32.195 --> 34:33.731
Whoa.
Whoa, what?
What, whoa?

34:33.863 --> 34:36.775
Well, when did you
shut off the road grid?

34:36.908 --> 34:37.863
A couple hours ago.

34:37.993 --> 34:40.985
Well, the signal has been
doubling in strength
every 4.4 seconds.

34:41.121 --> 34:45.080
It makes it
exponentially more powerful
than it was yesterday.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.490
How close is this thing?

34:48.128 --> 34:51.040
Close enough not to need
an amplifier anymore.

34:52.799 --> 34:54.255
And we can't
shut it off.

34:55.552 --> 34:56.712
It's just going
to get worse.

Tabitha?
Mmm-hmm.

TABITHA: Dr. Blake's
cell phone isn't picking up,

36:32.023 --> 36:33.979
and you have important
information to deliver.

36:34.109 --> 36:37.476
Deputy Lupo's new cruiser
can get you there faster.

36:37.612 --> 36:41.901
Thank you, Tabby.
When we get back,
I'll make this up to you.

from Dr. Deacon

and get back to G.D.
I want everything we have
ready to fire.

37:45.889 --> 37:46.844
Got it.

going to shoot it

Tabitha did
the best she could
with what she had.

Guess you won't
have to name your

39:13.309 --> 39:16.426
I'm getting massive
ionization building up
in the atmosphere.

39:16.563 --> 39:20.556
Yeah.
That's just a function
of the plasma wave.

39:20.692 --> 39:23.525
Well, it could also
ignite the ionosphere
if it keeps building.

burn the sky?

39:25.947 --> 39:27.903
If the ionization goes
critical, then yeah.

39:28.032 --> 39:30.409
We have to destroy
that thing before
it gets any closer.

39:30.535 --> 39:31.900
Allison, you can't.
You can't do that.

39:32.036 --> 39:33.412
Henry, what's the status
of that thing?

39:33.538 --> 39:35.824
It just crossed
the orbit of Mars.

39:35.957 --> 39:37.618
Well, how long
before it's in range?

39:37.750 --> 39:38.785
A few minutes, tops.

39:38.918 --> 39:40.579
Okay,

You can't
shoot it down.

39:55.143 --> 39:57.759
That's not my call, sweetie.

39:57.896 --> 40:00.603
It's putting a lot
of people in danger.

40:00.732 --> 40:03.474
But it's not on purpose.
It's like...

40:05.486 --> 40:07.317

Uh, Allison,
she says it's safe.

40:15.246 --> 40:16.656

See? It's not going
critical, Allison.

40:21.753 --> 40:22.868
It's not going to
ignite the atmosphere.

40:23.004 --> 40:25.245

We only have one shot
at this thing.

What do you mean,
you lost it?

40:34.140 --> 40:35.380

it's gone.

40:35.516 --> 40:37.802
Along with our chances
of destroying it.

40:37.936 --> 40:39.892

and trajectory,

it's headed
straight this way.

a way to hide.
They could be cloaking.

taking these towers down.

that's a good idea.

pumping energy
like a fusion reactor.

blow it up.

ready!

Stop!

41:12.512 --> 41:14.343
I know what it is.
It's not a weapon.

41:14.472 --> 41:15.837
It's a boson cloud
exciter.

41:17.016 --> 41:18.631
HENRY: Oh, my God.

41:21.479 --> 41:23.219
What's a boson cloud
exciter?

41:23.356 --> 41:26.018
The end point
for a high-velocity
space jump.

41:26.150 --> 41:28.311

catcher's mitt.

41:28.444 --> 41:31.936
Yeah, for a
670-million-mile-per—hour
fastball.

41:32.073 --> 41:33.654
It would be impossible
to slow it down

41:33.783 --> 41:36.024
without a cloud of bosons
to dissipate the energy.

41:36.160 --> 41:37.821
Well, we can't
just let it land.

41:37.954 --> 41:39.410
Well, I'm not sure
we can blow it up, either.

41:39.539 --> 41:42.281
The impact
would turn Eureka into
a mile-deep crater, Al.

41:45.962 --> 41:49.955
