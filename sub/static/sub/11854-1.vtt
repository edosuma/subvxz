WEBVTT

00:15.917 --> 00:17.875
You can barely tell.

00:17.959 --> 00:18.959
laughs

00:19.041 --> 00:19.917
I'm flying.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.959
both laughing

00:22.041 --> 00:24.291
Good as new. Look.

00:24.375 --> 00:25.709
Todd's sick of me.

00:25.792 --> 00:27.291
So maybe you're sick of him.

00:27.375 --> 00:28.750
Let's go back
to Tim's room.

00:28.834 --> 00:30.667
He's cooler than
any of them.

00:30.750 --> 00:32.709
You really want to?

00:32.792 --> 00:34.417
Maybe later.

00:36.959 --> 00:38.375
horn honking

00:40.000 --> 00:44.417
music grows louder

00:52.792 --> 00:54.083
More than a feeling...

00:54.166 --> 00:56.041
You're not supposed
to have people here.

00:56.125 --> 00:57.000
Who says?

00:57.083 --> 00:58.750
Your mom and dad.

00:58.834 --> 01:00.709
You're going to call them
in Jakarta?

01:00.792 --> 01:02.959
Give the lady a beer
for her silence.

01:03.041 --> 01:04.834
Is Jill coming?

01:04.917 --> 01:06.375
What do you think?

01:06.458 --> 01:07.417
I saw her today.

01:07.500 --> 01:09.041
She said maybe,
maybe not.

01:09.125 --> 01:10.458
Please.

01:10.542 --> 01:12.125
She's coming.

01:12.208 --> 01:14.125
Who's going to clean this up
in the morning?

01:14.208 --> 01:16.083
Go watch TV, Bonita.

01:18.875 --> 01:20.875
There she is.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.333
Oh, hi, gorgeous.

01:34.875 --> 01:36.041
song fades

02:34.959 --> 02:39.083
sighs
siren wailing

02:48.667 --> 02:49.625
What'd we get?

02:49.709 --> 02:50.917
A triple.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.041
You writing?

02:57.125 --> 02:57.959
Yeah.

02:58.041 --> 02:59.959
How you doing, Detectives?

03:00.041 --> 03:04.000
Trash still here,
chairs on the floor.

03:04.083 --> 03:05.083
They hadn't closed yet.

03:05.166 --> 03:06.917
Eight years on the line,

03:07.000 --> 03:07.875
never had a triple.

03:07.959 --> 03:08.792
Last out gets the action.

03:08.875 --> 03:10.166
This an overnighter?

03:10.250 --> 03:11.625
RUSH:
Kid who opens up
found them this morning.

03:11.709 --> 03:12.792
OFFICER:
Look like
a robbery?

03:12.875 --> 03:15.083
Go talk to
the scene man, kid.

03:15.166 --> 03:16.792
Register's raided.

03:16.875 --> 03:18.500
Let's get it dusted.

03:22.792 --> 03:24.500
It's a bad case of death.

03:24.583 --> 03:27.041
DETECTIVE:
All three shot.

03:27.125 --> 03:28.709
Her throat's cut.

03:28.792 --> 03:29.959
Doer's got a gun.

03:30.041 --> 03:32.000
Why's he gotta
slit her throat, too?

03:33.041 --> 03:35.083
OFFICER:
Um, Detective?

03:35.166 --> 03:36.542
When you dust
the register...

03:36.625 --> 03:40.709
We might find your prints?

03:40.792 --> 03:42.875
That's why we keep
our hands full.

03:42.959 --> 03:46.917
All right,
I'm knocking on some doors.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.125
We boring you in here?

03:48.208 --> 03:49.834
Stillman called.

03:49.917 --> 03:52.166
There's a civilian
down at Central,
wants to talk to you.

03:52.250 --> 03:53.125
Me?

03:53.208 --> 03:55.083
Asked for a lady in Homicide.

04:07.625 --> 04:09.291
I hear you were
in the Badlands.

04:09.375 --> 04:11.041
Della's Chicken
and Ribs.

04:11.125 --> 04:13.083
What's the deal
with this civilian?

04:13.166 --> 04:14.834
Civilian?

04:14.917 --> 04:16.041
Probably some nut job.

04:16.125 --> 04:17.000
Vera said that he, uh...

04:17.083 --> 04:18.542
I told Vera to deal with her.

04:18.625 --> 04:19.667
I've been on
since midnight.

04:19.750 --> 04:21.166
I got three murders
to solve,

04:21.250 --> 04:22.834
and he's pawning his
dog calls off on me?

04:22.917 --> 04:24.000
I know, Lil.

04:24.083 --> 04:26.000
He is one pain
in the ass, boss.

04:26.083 --> 04:26.959
Yeah, look,
she's right outside.

04:27.041 --> 04:28.375
Just chase her demons away.

04:28.458 --> 04:30.333
Your triple's not going
to go anywhere, all right?

04:30.417 --> 04:32.000
You better give Vera
some hell.

04:32.083 --> 04:34.166
Like it would do any good.

04:43.208 --> 04:46.333
I'm Detective Rush.
Homicide.

04:48.208 --> 04:50.000
You do murders?

04:50.083 --> 04:51.750
I investigate murders.

04:51.834 --> 04:55.875
I want to tell you about one.

04:57.166 --> 04:58.792
What's your name?

05:00.250 --> 05:02.542
Bonita...

05:02.625 --> 05:03.542
Bonita Rafael.

05:03.625 --> 05:05.125
sniffs

05:05.208 --> 05:07.166
You been smoking some pot today,
Bonita?

05:08.291 --> 05:10.875
It helps with the pain.

05:10.959 --> 05:12.333
I've got cancer.

05:14.291 --> 05:15.375
Sorry.

05:15.458 --> 05:19.083
I saw a murder.

05:21.041 --> 05:25.375
A girl was killed
on a tennis court.

05:25.458 --> 05:28.041
Where's the court?

05:28.125 --> 05:30.709
Chestnut Hill.

05:30.792 --> 05:33.625
At the house
where I used to work.

05:33.709 --> 05:38.458
<i>The boys were having a party.</i>

05:38.542 --> 05:40.709
boy shouting
Shut your mouth!

05:40.792 --> 05:43.959
You shut your mouth!

05:44.041 --> 05:46.583
Hey, slut, I said
shut your mouth!

05:49.166 --> 05:50.250
girl gasps

05:50.333 --> 05:52.750
material ripping

05:56.083 --> 05:57.750
girl screams

05:57.834 --> 05:59.750
grunting

05:59.834 --> 06:02.750
BONITA:
<i>He hit her...</i>

06:02.834 --> 06:04.250
girl screams

06:04.333 --> 06:05.917
<i>...over and over</i>

06:06.000 --> 06:08.250
and over and over.

06:08.333 --> 06:10.125
You didn't call the police?

06:10.208 --> 06:12.625
I went to bed.

06:12.709 --> 06:15.500
I thought it wasn't my business.

06:15.583 --> 06:17.834
A girl dying
wasn't your business?

06:18.959 --> 06:21.792
And when did this happen?

06:21.875 --> 06:24.917
In 1976.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.125
1976, Bonita?

06:28.208 --> 06:30.125
27 years ago,

06:30.208 --> 06:32.166
and you're just telling
this now?

06:32.250 --> 06:34.792
I had a son.

06:34.875 --> 06:36.542
I needed to work.

06:36.625 --> 06:41.458
But now I have
this cancer.

06:51.583 --> 06:54.458
Whew... something die in here?

06:54.542 --> 06:56.000
These cases.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.458
The timing adds up.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.166
Jill Shelby,
beaten at a neighbor's house,

06:59.250 --> 07:00.166
found the next morning.

07:00.250 --> 07:01.166
Case was never solved.

07:01.250 --> 07:03.834
Yeah, like the rest
of these jobs.

07:03.917 --> 07:04.959
But now we got a witness.

07:05.041 --> 07:07.125
Are you saying we should open

07:07.208 --> 07:09.333
a 27-year old case, Lil?

07:09.417 --> 07:10.625
There's new direction.

07:10.709 --> 07:12.667
Yeah, witnesses
from that long ago

07:12.750 --> 07:14.458
are going to be pretty shaky.

07:14.542 --> 07:15.583
Maybe. But then,
time can be

07:15.667 --> 07:16.667
on our side.

07:16.750 --> 07:18.166
People who wouldn't
talk then

07:18.250 --> 07:19.250
might be willing
to now.

07:19.333 --> 07:21.333
Look at this maid.
Mm-hmm.

07:21.417 --> 07:22.333
I mean, time passes.

07:22.417 --> 07:23.333
People's loyalties

07:23.417 --> 07:25.083
and circumstances
change.

07:25.166 --> 07:26.291
Do you believe this maid?

07:26.375 --> 07:29.125
Yeah. I do.

07:29.208 --> 07:32.375
I don't know
the assigned detective.

07:32.458 --> 07:34.333
Britt.

07:34.417 --> 07:36.709
I bet Jeffries does.

07:43.834 --> 07:45.083
MAN:
Britt was top shelf.

07:45.166 --> 07:48.709
Got killed in Camden
trying to pick up a fugitive.

07:48.792 --> 07:50.375
So he's not the reason
the job went cold.

07:50.458 --> 07:52.583
Uh-uh. And I remember this one.

07:52.667 --> 07:53.875
It made him crazy.

07:53.959 --> 07:54.959
The girl's mother

07:55.041 --> 07:57.250
would come in year after year,

07:57.333 --> 07:59.375
Britt never had anything
for her.

07:59.458 --> 08:01.542
Who'd he look at for the doer?

08:01.625 --> 08:04.000
The two brothers,
one being the boyfriend.

08:04.083 --> 08:05.417
A live-in cook
made the list.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.333
And, of course,

08:07.417 --> 08:09.041
some folks thought
a gang of black kids

08:09.125 --> 08:11.375
must have come to Chestnut Hill
that night.

08:13.458 --> 08:14.542
The boyfriend his top pick?

08:14.625 --> 08:15.542
Yeah, it was rumored

08:15.625 --> 08:16.667
he had been violent with her.

08:16.750 --> 08:18.041
Todd Whitley?

08:18.125 --> 08:19.041
Oh, yeah.

08:19.125 --> 08:21.208
Cocky little jerk, as I recall.

08:21.291 --> 08:22.500
From a society family.

08:22.583 --> 08:25.834
No one would talk
about those boys.

08:25.917 --> 08:28.250
The old man was too powerful.

08:28.333 --> 08:31.000
Put up walls
Britt couldn't even get past.

08:32.208 --> 08:34.000
Someone should
read the job again.

08:34.083 --> 08:37.125
Maybe those walls
are shakier now.

08:37.208 --> 08:39.083
How about you?

08:39.166 --> 08:40.500
I got a job.

08:40.583 --> 08:42.000
But Vera might
get a sense

08:42.083 --> 08:43.333
of achievement
out of it.

08:43.417 --> 08:44.959
You spoke to the maid,
Lil.

08:45.041 --> 08:46.667
Only 'cause he stuck me
with her.

08:49.041 --> 08:50.500
This job deserves
another look

08:50.583 --> 08:53.250
and Vera doesn't have
the type of personality

08:53.333 --> 08:55.375
to get anywhere
with society people.

08:59.458 --> 09:01.792
You give Vera my triple,

09:01.875 --> 09:05.500
you're going to find him
in Della's freezer.

09:17.375 --> 09:20.500
Excuse me, is
Evelyn Shelby here?

09:20.583 --> 09:22.625
I'm Evelyn.

09:25.333 --> 09:27.375
Hi. Lilly Rush.

09:27.458 --> 09:30.125
How'd you find
this house?

09:30.208 --> 09:33.750
Well, I'm a detective.
Homicide.

09:33.834 --> 09:38.208
Is it about someone
who stayed here?

09:39.458 --> 09:41.792
No, um...

09:41.875 --> 09:44.333
it's about
your daughter.

09:45.917 --> 09:47.083
A witness

09:47.166 --> 09:48.834
has come forward
in her case.

09:48.917 --> 09:51.542
Someone who worked
in the neighborhood.

09:53.417 --> 09:54.542
So you don't know anything.

09:54.625 --> 09:58.208
We have new direction.

09:58.291 --> 10:01.333
Look, I came into Homicide
every August,

10:01.417 --> 10:02.667
for over 20 years.

10:02.750 --> 10:05.458
Eventually, I figured out
that Detective Britt

10:05.542 --> 10:06.834
was too much
of a gentleman

10:06.917 --> 10:08.375
to tell me
to stop coming,

10:08.458 --> 10:09.417
that her case

10:09.500 --> 10:11.917
would never be solved.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.250
You can only hope so long.

10:14.333 --> 10:16.291
So I should just forget
about Jill?

10:16.375 --> 10:18.166
How about
Todd Whitley?

10:18.250 --> 10:20.417
Should I forget him, too?

10:20.500 --> 10:21.709
Todd was lovely
to Jill.

10:21.792 --> 10:25.375
Really, I... hear
he knocked her around.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.208
What's lovely
about that?

10:27.291 --> 10:30.875
I still see Todd Whitley...
and Melanie.

10:30.959 --> 10:32.458
They're married now.

10:32.542 --> 10:35.375
Melanie...

10:35.458 --> 10:36.834
Jill's best friend?

10:36.917 --> 10:40.875
They became close
after she died.

10:40.959 --> 10:42.166
And I'm not interested

10:42.250 --> 10:45.291
in stirring up more accusations
against him.

10:47.208 --> 10:49.750
Well, I'm reopening
the case.

10:49.834 --> 10:51.959
I'm not saying
don't do your job,

10:52.041 --> 10:55.333
it's just that no one's
been able to solve it

10:55.417 --> 10:57.625
after all these years.

10:59.583 --> 11:04.417
And... and I-I just can't
get pulled in again.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
RUSH:
<i>What kind of person</i>

11:17.083 --> 11:18.166
doesn't want to solve

11:18.250 --> 11:19.375
her daughter's murder?

11:20.834 --> 11:23.083
Someone in a lot of pain?

11:23.166 --> 11:24.625
Well, she won't
help me with Todd,

11:24.709 --> 11:26.125
she thinks he's
a golden boy.

11:26.208 --> 11:27.750
And the best friend's
married to him.

11:27.834 --> 11:29.166
That's a tight inner circle.

11:29.250 --> 11:31.083
So if Jill's own
mom isn't on board,

11:31.166 --> 11:34.000
who's this for?

11:37.792 --> 11:40.333
You working a dead case
instead of our triple?

11:40.417 --> 11:41.625
Talk to him.

11:41.709 --> 11:42.959
Unsolved isn't dead, Las.

11:43.041 --> 11:44.875
And she's got direction.
Don't you?

11:44.959 --> 11:48.250
Yeah, but I also got three
murders at this restaurant.

11:48.333 --> 11:49.208
All right.

11:49.291 --> 11:51.125
Who else can you go to on this?

11:51.208 --> 11:52.333
Well, not Melanie.

11:52.417 --> 11:54.000
So, I guess that leaves
the brothers.

11:54.083 --> 11:56.041
What was their
party line
on the abuse?

11:56.125 --> 11:58.875
The party line was
don't talk to the cops.

11:58.959 --> 12:00.208
Going out on the street, boss.

12:00.291 --> 12:01.500
Right.

12:01.583 --> 12:03.291
Neighborhood survey on Della's.
You coming?

12:03.375 --> 12:06.709
Let me work this one for one
more interview-- then I'm back.

12:06.792 --> 12:07.959
Great.

12:08.041 --> 12:10.750
All right, what's your play
with the brothers?

12:10.834 --> 12:12.375
Todd's a superstar
lawyer now.

12:12.458 --> 12:14.834
Eric is more
of a fringe case.

12:14.917 --> 12:19.125
Divorced, drinking problem,
doesn't exactly work.

12:19.208 --> 12:21.250
Sounds like he's
your first stop.

12:42.875 --> 12:44.000
Eric?

12:44.083 --> 12:45.750
Yeah?

12:45.834 --> 12:48.083
Detective Rush.

12:48.166 --> 12:49.709
I'm heading out.
I have a meeting.

12:49.792 --> 12:52.792
There's a 1:00 in Old City.

12:52.875 --> 12:55.166
It's not that
kind of meeting.

12:55.250 --> 12:57.041
Oh.

12:57.125 --> 12:59.625
It'll just take
a few minutes.

12:59.709 --> 13:01.417
It's about Jill Shelby.

13:01.500 --> 13:03.625
You were in school
with her, right?

13:03.709 --> 13:04.750
Chelsea Day?

13:07.083 --> 13:09.166
I can't talk to you.

13:09.250 --> 13:11.000
How come?

13:11.083 --> 13:14.375
They treated my brother and me
like suspects back then.

13:14.458 --> 13:16.125
Well, it was
an open secret

13:16.208 --> 13:17.875
Todd was hitting Jill.

13:19.917 --> 13:21.291
He loved Jill.

13:21.375 --> 13:25.875
People hit people they love.

13:25.959 --> 13:28.166
I shouldn't say any more.

13:28.250 --> 13:31.458
Maybe you could just tell me
what she was like.

13:33.250 --> 13:34.875
She was nice.

13:34.959 --> 13:39.875
When you were alone
with her, at least.

13:39.959 --> 13:41.875
When you weren't alone?

13:44.291 --> 13:46.250
I don't want to speak
ill of the dead.

13:46.333 --> 13:48.458
It's okay. I hear
it every day.

13:50.500 --> 13:52.375
She'd ignore you.

13:52.458 --> 13:54.542
She ignore you that night?

13:54.625 --> 13:58.417
She was at her worst at parties.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.208
GIRLS:
Whoo!

14:00.291 --> 14:02.417
All right, is it my turn?

14:02.500 --> 14:04.458
Yes.

14:05.500 --> 14:07.083
I see dollar signs,

14:07.166 --> 14:08.500
already, Charlie.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.750
That was a $50 value.

14:18.834 --> 14:21.041
Thank you!

14:24.375 --> 14:25.583
Come on, Jill.

14:25.667 --> 14:28.041
Tell us what a kiss
from Eric's worth.

14:28.125 --> 14:30.250
I can't.

14:30.333 --> 14:32.250
He's Todd's brother.

14:32.333 --> 14:35.458
You've already kissed
two other guys.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.125
I'm not into it.

14:42.333 --> 14:44.125
Come here, Eric.

14:50.417 --> 14:53.709
So she was kind of a bitch
to you that night.

14:53.792 --> 14:55.166
She didn't mean it.

14:55.250 --> 14:59.333
That was just the way
she got sometimes.

14:59.417 --> 15:01.750
Mmm.

15:02.875 --> 15:04.959
Anyway, I need to go.

15:05.041 --> 15:08.375
Oh, did you letter
in high school?

15:08.458 --> 15:11.458
You look kind of athletic.

15:11.542 --> 15:13.291
One year.

15:13.375 --> 15:15.375
Wrestling.

15:21.625 --> 15:23.166
Todd Whitley.

15:23.250 --> 15:24.250
Lilly Rush.

15:24.333 --> 15:26.000
Have a seat, Lilly.

15:28.417 --> 15:30.500
Who'd you row for?

15:30.583 --> 15:32.041
Chelsea Day then Penn.

15:32.125 --> 15:34.500
I'm still on
the water most mornings.

15:34.583 --> 15:36.000
Impressive.

15:36.083 --> 15:38.000
This is about Eric I assume.

15:38.083 --> 15:40.667
You don't seem too shocked
he might be in trouble.

15:40.750 --> 15:43.458
Patterns of behavior, right?

15:45.542 --> 15:47.333
Recognize her?

15:51.458 --> 15:52.834
What is this?

15:52.917 --> 15:55.500
A homicide investigation.

15:55.583 --> 15:58.250
Look, that was painful
for a lot of people.

15:58.333 --> 16:00.458
I suggest you leave it alone.

16:00.542 --> 16:01.542
I can't do that.

16:01.625 --> 16:03.667
It's an open case.

16:06.208 --> 16:08.250
Why did someone like you
become a cop?

16:08.333 --> 16:14.500
Oh, bad education,
limited talent.

16:14.583 --> 16:19.500
You should be married,
living the good life.

16:19.583 --> 16:20.917
chuckles

16:21.000 --> 16:24.250
Well, no one ever asked.

16:25.917 --> 16:28.375
So here I am working a homicide.

16:28.458 --> 16:30.250
Well, as I
told the cops

16:30.333 --> 16:32.750
at the time, I was with
my brother all night.

16:32.834 --> 16:34.208
Actually, a lawyer

16:34.291 --> 16:37.834
told them that in a statement
three weeks later.

16:37.917 --> 16:39.500
So?

16:41.458 --> 16:45.458
Look... my father owned
half of Philadelphia.

16:45.542 --> 16:46.834
Mm-hmm.

16:46.917 --> 16:50.583
People like to see
families like ours in trouble.

16:50.667 --> 16:51.917
We hired a lawyer.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.959
Maybe your kind of people
don't do that--

16:55.041 --> 16:56.083
mine do.

16:56.166 --> 16:58.500
Even if there's
nothing to hide?

16:58.583 --> 17:00.000
I can't help you anymore.

17:00.083 --> 17:03.500
I understand you're
married to Melanie now.

17:03.583 --> 17:05.250
She can't help you either.

17:05.333 --> 17:07.834
Do you still have a problem
with violence?

17:07.917 --> 17:09.250
I know you once hit

17:09.333 --> 17:12.750
Jill hard enough to give her
three stitches and all.

17:12.834 --> 17:14.208
Everyone knew
the cops

17:14.291 --> 17:16.458
had it in for me over Jill.

17:16.542 --> 17:18.375
They were wrong then,

17:18.458 --> 17:20.166
you are wrong now.

17:20.250 --> 17:21.709
Ever hit Melanie?

17:23.667 --> 17:24.792
All right, Lilly,

17:24.875 --> 17:27.834
you're right.

17:27.917 --> 17:31.458
Someone did beat the crap out
of Jill on a regular basis.

17:31.542 --> 17:32.792
But it wasn't me.

17:32.875 --> 17:36.375
Her father was
a real son of a bitch.

17:58.375 --> 18:02.000
You sure know
how to find people.

18:02.083 --> 18:04.417
I thought you'd still be living
in Chestnut Hill.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.166
I like the city.

18:07.625 --> 18:09.542
Did you find something?

18:09.625 --> 18:11.875
Autopsy reports
and medical records.

18:11.959 --> 18:13.625
And?

18:13.709 --> 18:15.417
I just don't understand
these injuries

18:15.500 --> 18:16.667
Jill had before she died.

18:16.750 --> 18:18.000
Injuries?

18:18.083 --> 18:20.083
Broken rib when
she was 12...

18:20.166 --> 18:23.834
a concussion... a jaw fracture
at nine years old.

18:23.917 --> 18:25.000
What's the deal?

18:25.083 --> 18:28.542
She played field hockey
and soccer.

18:28.625 --> 18:29.834
Uh-huh.

18:29.917 --> 18:32.500
She was very active.

18:32.583 --> 18:35.500
Evelyn, my ex-husband was
a mean drunk.

18:35.583 --> 18:38.125
I know the difference between
a soccer injury

18:38.208 --> 18:39.667
and a trip
down the stairs.

18:41.625 --> 18:44.083
Did your husband beat
your daughter?

18:44.166 --> 18:47.041
He was in Houston
the night she died.

18:47.125 --> 18:48.834
That wasn't my question.

18:48.917 --> 18:50.542
He's been dead nine years.

18:50.625 --> 18:55.250
And now you work at a shelter
for battered women and children.

18:56.625 --> 18:59.417
Where did you get that?

18:59.500 --> 19:00.667
The case file.

19:06.750 --> 19:08.750
I took this picture.

19:17.959 --> 19:20.875
I don't see how
you can just forget her, Evelyn.

19:20.959 --> 19:23.667
Forget?

19:23.750 --> 19:27.709
I think about her every day.

19:27.792 --> 19:30.458
This ruined my life.

19:30.542 --> 19:33.208
Then it still matters.

19:34.166 --> 19:35.875
I can't look back.

19:35.959 --> 19:39.417
It's too hard.

19:39.500 --> 19:42.291
So you sell your
Chestnut Hill house,

19:42.375 --> 19:43.917
pack up your old life

19:44.000 --> 19:46.667
and think you
can just walk away?

19:46.750 --> 19:49.583
You can't walk
away from her, Evelyn.

19:49.667 --> 19:51.291
She's a part of you.

19:54.709 --> 19:57.875
There's new hope now.

19:57.959 --> 20:02.625
And what if you don't solve it?

20:02.709 --> 20:04.750
Where does that leave me?

20:04.834 --> 20:07.917
What if I do solve it?

20:26.709 --> 20:30.125
My husband doesn't want me
talking to you.

20:30.208 --> 20:31.458
Todd doesn't
want you helping

20:31.542 --> 20:33.875
with your best friend's
murder investigation?

20:33.959 --> 20:36.333
I thought we put this to rest.

20:36.417 --> 20:40.500
It's important to me, Melly.

20:40.583 --> 20:43.166
So you came to the party
with Jill but left alone?

20:43.250 --> 20:44.625
I drank too much.

20:44.709 --> 20:46.417
I had to go home
and I couldn't find her.

20:46.500 --> 20:47.959
You made a big point

20:48.041 --> 20:51.750
in your interview that you were
sure it wasn't Todd.

20:51.834 --> 20:54.500
The detective made
a big point of
asking about him.

20:54.583 --> 20:55.834
He was fixated on
the Whitleys,

20:55.917 --> 20:57.667
but barely
looked at Tim Dorn.

20:57.750 --> 20:59.500
This is the cook?

20:59.583 --> 21:01.667
He lived in our guest house,

21:01.750 --> 21:02.500
and he was with

21:02.583 --> 21:03.458
the girls that night.

21:03.542 --> 21:04.917
When we left
for the party,

21:05.000 --> 21:07.875
he told Jill she should come by
later if she wanted.

21:07.959 --> 21:10.000
When I heard
she was missing

21:10.083 --> 21:11.250
the next day,

21:11.333 --> 21:14.709
Tim was the first
person I thought of.

21:18.250 --> 21:20.208
RUSH:
<i>All this information</i>

21:20.291 --> 21:21.542
and I got one page on the guy

21:21.625 --> 21:23.250
the mother and best friend
think did it.

21:23.333 --> 21:25.750
You got to listen
to the best friend.

21:27.208 --> 21:29.667
Teenage girls tell
each other everything.

21:29.750 --> 21:31.792
Well, Britt wrote
two sentences on him,

21:31.875 --> 21:34.500
then blew him off.

21:34.583 --> 21:37.875
It's hard to tell if he
even worked him hard enough.

21:37.959 --> 21:39.583
Especially when he
had it out for Todd.

21:41.959 --> 21:44.125
Dorn's up in Frackville.

21:44.208 --> 21:45.625
Locked up?

21:47.291 --> 21:49.709
Why do you think
he's going to talk to you?

21:49.792 --> 21:52.041
I'm an optimist.

21:52.125 --> 21:54.875
Lil, I got a wife at home.

21:54.959 --> 21:56.709
You don't have to come.

21:56.792 --> 21:58.792
You think it's a dead case.

22:01.875 --> 22:02.959
Let me just call her.

22:06.125 --> 22:08.959
LASSING:
Five years for forgery.

22:09.041 --> 22:12.709
I got a facility for it,
gets me into trouble.

22:12.792 --> 22:15.625
You ever dabble in
more serious crime?

22:15.709 --> 22:18.291
Like the violence done
to Jill Shelby?

22:18.375 --> 22:19.500
No, ma'am.

22:19.583 --> 22:21.792
I'm strictly
a cerebral criminal.

22:21.875 --> 22:24.875
Pretty attractive, wasn't she?

22:24.959 --> 22:27.750
She was pretty cute, for a girl.

22:27.834 --> 22:30.542
RUSH:
You did tell her to
come over that night.

22:30.625 --> 22:33.083
She came over a lot to get high.

22:33.166 --> 22:36.041
She and her
little vixen friend Melanie.

22:36.125 --> 22:39.667
Well, that little
vixen thinks that
you killed Jill.

22:39.750 --> 22:41.917
Well, if you marry
the prime suspect

22:42.000 --> 22:44.792
I guess you better point
to someone else.

22:44.875 --> 22:47.000
Jill's mom also thinks
you did it.

22:47.083 --> 22:49.917
A woman lives
in a certain world.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.166
If the shining neighbor boy
killed her daughter,

22:53.250 --> 22:54.583
that world's a lie.

22:54.667 --> 22:57.333
Britt has your
alibi down here

22:57.417 --> 22:59.625
as going to bed
at 10:00.

22:59.709 --> 23:04.083
I guess he must have
kept his word.

23:04.166 --> 23:08.792
Actually, I was with
a... "friend" that night.

23:08.875 --> 23:10.500
What friend?

23:10.583 --> 23:11.959
Bobby Jordan.

23:12.041 --> 23:15.875
This big, luscious college boy
down the street.

23:17.041 --> 23:19.166
Neither of us
was exactly out and proud

23:19.250 --> 23:21.375
at the time,
so we asked Britt

23:21.458 --> 23:23.834
not to document
the sleepover.

23:23.917 --> 23:25.667
Bobby's gonna confirm that?

23:25.750 --> 23:29.667
Well, I imagine he's come
to terms by now.

23:29.750 --> 23:32.667
RUSH:
Did Jill ever talk
to you about Todd?

23:32.750 --> 23:35.959
Oh, sure. Those girls
told me everything.

23:36.041 --> 23:37.750
Like what?

23:37.834 --> 23:39.834
Teenage drama.

23:39.917 --> 23:43.458
They even told me things
they didn't tell each other.

23:43.542 --> 23:46.041
Like all the while
Jill was fretting

23:46.125 --> 23:47.834
that Todd doesn't
treat her right,

23:47.917 --> 23:51.333
Melanie was doing
him on the side.

24:09.750 --> 24:10.750
You can't be here.

24:10.834 --> 24:11.834
RUSH:
Gate was open.

24:11.917 --> 24:13.959
My partner,
Chris Lassing.

24:14.041 --> 24:14.959
How you doing?

24:15.041 --> 24:16.083
Todd is furious at you.

24:16.166 --> 24:17.250
Uh-oh.

24:17.333 --> 24:18.959
Thanks to you his
brother came here

24:19.041 --> 24:22.500
last night, drunk,
after six years
of being sober.

24:22.583 --> 24:23.875
Eric did?

24:23.959 --> 24:25.834
Look, I've told you
about Tim Dorn.

24:25.917 --> 24:28.083
Why do you have to
keep bothering us?

24:28.166 --> 24:29.208
Dorn's alibi checked out.

24:29.291 --> 24:31.000
We know about you
and Todd

24:31.083 --> 24:32.959
stepping out on
Jill back then.

24:33.041 --> 24:36.041
I... I don't have
to talk to you.

24:36.125 --> 24:37.375
RUSH:
Do we have to arrest you?

24:37.458 --> 24:39.208
You don't want that, Lady.

24:39.291 --> 24:40.500
You should see our holding cell.

24:40.583 --> 24:42.250
Your headband
will get all dirty.

24:42.333 --> 24:43.375
Why does this matter?

24:43.458 --> 24:44.709
RUSH:
'Cause when you tell us

24:44.792 --> 24:46.333
one lie, Melanie,
even if it's small,

24:46.417 --> 24:48.834
that makes us think you're
hiding other things.

24:48.917 --> 24:51.208
Like whatever Todd did to Jill
that night.

24:51.291 --> 24:53.875
It wasn't Todd, okay?

24:55.625 --> 24:57.417
I know...

24:59.291 --> 25:01.792
because I was with him
that night.

25:08.709 --> 25:11.375
That is some top.

25:13.125 --> 25:14.917
It's new.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.542
You look like, uh...

25:17.625 --> 25:19.375
What?

25:19.458 --> 25:22.750
A patriotic street walker.

25:22.834 --> 25:25.583
chuckling

25:25.667 --> 25:29.333
<i>Seventeen.</i>

25:38.500 --> 25:40.166
Why do you have to be a jerk?

25:40.250 --> 25:43.417
Why don't you go
and comfort her?

25:47.041 --> 25:50.458
You know, you could use
some time in charm school.

25:50.542 --> 25:52.792
Could I?

25:52.875 --> 25:55.125
I could give you
a tutorial...

25:56.417 --> 25:59.208
upstairs.

25:59.291 --> 26:02.000
What about Jill?

26:02.083 --> 26:03.834
What about her?

26:08.208 --> 26:10.792
I'm obviously not proud of it.

26:10.875 --> 26:15.000
It sounds like Eric had
pretty strong feelings for Jill.

26:15.083 --> 26:16.125
So?

26:16.208 --> 26:17.500
So why'd he fall off the wagon

26:17.583 --> 26:19.500
just 'cause Jill's name came up?

26:23.709 --> 26:26.333
ducks quacking

26:51.250 --> 26:54.333
breathing heavily

27:09.458 --> 27:12.375
Two million people in this city,

27:12.458 --> 27:14.542
I got to run into you?

27:14.625 --> 27:15.750
You think I'm thrilled
seeing you?

27:15.834 --> 27:17.166
All right, look,

27:17.250 --> 27:20.375
I'm sorry if I was
obnoxious in your office.

27:20.458 --> 27:21.500
More than obnoxious.

27:21.583 --> 27:22.709
It's just the
way that you

27:22.792 --> 27:25.291
were looking out
for Eric. It was...

27:25.375 --> 27:26.750
panting

27:26.834 --> 27:27.834
I hear he's
drinking again.

27:27.917 --> 27:29.333
You don't talk about Eric.

27:29.417 --> 27:32.417
Todd, I know that you were
with Melanie that night.

27:32.500 --> 27:34.041
Excuse me?

27:34.125 --> 27:35.166
Which doesn't add up

27:35.250 --> 27:37.041
with you saying
you were with Eric.

27:37.125 --> 27:39.333
So I figure that you
just said that to
protect him.

27:39.417 --> 27:41.667
Okay, let's say I was
with Melanie that night.

27:41.750 --> 27:43.417
You can understand
why I wouldn't want

27:43.500 --> 27:45.333
the entire world
knowing that, right?

27:45.417 --> 27:46.959
Right.

27:47.041 --> 27:49.709
So why not just say
that you were sleeping?

27:49.792 --> 27:52.375
Why give Eric
an alibi?

27:52.458 --> 27:53.125
You should drop this.

27:53.208 --> 27:54.250
Eric did it.

27:54.333 --> 27:55.583
That's why you can
sleep at night

27:55.667 --> 27:57.792
and have a normal
life, and he's a mess.

27:57.875 --> 27:59.083
Just watch it.

27:59.166 --> 28:00.250
When did
the hard drinking start?

28:00.333 --> 28:01.417
After he killed her?

28:01.500 --> 28:03.917
I can make your life
very difficult.

28:04.000 --> 28:04.792
Eric kills Jill...

28:04.875 --> 28:06.208
you clean up after him.

28:06.291 --> 28:09.041
Brother's keeper ever since.
Am I close?

28:09.125 --> 28:11.959
Tell me something, Lilly.

28:12.041 --> 28:17.125
What is the point of all of this
after so many years?

28:17.208 --> 28:19.667
People shouldn't be forgotten.

28:19.750 --> 28:21.333
Even if they are my kind
of people.

28:21.417 --> 28:23.500
Maybe they don't have
a lot of money,

28:23.583 --> 28:25.667
they don't have lawyers...

28:25.750 --> 28:28.083
but they matter.

28:28.166 --> 28:30.417
They should get justice, too.

28:30.500 --> 28:33.792
I see.

28:33.875 --> 28:36.125
You're a crusader.

28:36.208 --> 28:38.333
I guess I am.

28:38.417 --> 28:40.375
chuckles

28:40.458 --> 28:42.208
Good luck.

28:46.291 --> 28:48.959
siren blaring

28:49.041 --> 28:52.041
STILLMAN:
<i>So, is sleep like</i>
<i>an optional thing for you?</i>

28:52.125 --> 28:54.667
I'm not tired.

28:54.750 --> 28:57.333
Guess who weighed in
on your case today?

28:57.417 --> 29:01.458
Mmm... the commissioner.

29:04.667 --> 29:05.834
The commissioner?

29:05.917 --> 29:07.667
Apparently he

29:07.750 --> 29:10.875
and the Whitleys' father
were college pals.

29:10.959 --> 29:13.166
Todd called Bradley
to tattle on me?

29:13.250 --> 29:14.208
What a baby.

29:14.291 --> 29:15.875
And now Bradley's wondering

29:15.959 --> 29:18.125
when you're going back
on the line.

29:18.208 --> 29:19.709
He couldn't pick me
out of a line up.

29:19.792 --> 29:21.834
Suddenly he's tracking
my career? Screw him.

29:21.917 --> 29:23.875
Don't say that too loud
in this building.

29:23.959 --> 29:25.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:25.083 --> 29:26.667
VERA:
Rush...

29:26.750 --> 29:28.291
your boyfriend's downstairs.

29:28.375 --> 29:30.417
I'm single. You sure
it's not your boyfriend?

29:30.500 --> 29:32.834
One of the Whitleys...
booked for DUI.

29:37.917 --> 29:40.125
Mm.
Mm-hmm.

29:42.917 --> 29:45.834
RUSH:
You crash that nice car
of yours, Eric?

29:45.917 --> 29:47.500
Thanks to you.

29:47.583 --> 29:48.500
I had something
to do with it?

29:48.583 --> 29:49.625
All I did
was bring up Jill.

29:49.709 --> 29:51.291
Why's that send you
on a bender?

29:51.375 --> 29:54.375
My brother called our lawyer,
who called the commissioner,

29:54.458 --> 29:56.333
who's a very close
family friend.

29:56.417 --> 29:57.709
I heard all about it.

29:57.792 --> 30:00.166
Then why don't you take
a hint and back off?

30:02.667 --> 30:03.667
'Cause something tells me

30:03.750 --> 30:05.291
you and I are
one scotch away

30:05.375 --> 30:07.583
from a good conversation.

30:27.792 --> 30:28.709
Hey, Lil.

30:28.792 --> 30:30.291
Hey.
Hey.

30:30.375 --> 30:32.917
Las is in with Evelyn Shelby.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.250
Huh.

30:40.583 --> 30:43.583
EVELYN:
I kept my own box on Jill.
It's been packed away

30:43.667 --> 30:45.250
for years, but I
thought maybe it could help.

30:45.333 --> 30:46.583
Good.

30:46.667 --> 30:48.917
Melanie told me about
her and Todd in high school,

30:49.000 --> 30:50.667
behind Jill's back.

30:50.750 --> 30:52.917
Well, she was only 15.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.583
LASSING:
Mrs. Shelby,

30:54.667 --> 30:56.834
it looks like we're
closing in on Eric Whitley.

30:56.917 --> 30:58.542
The younger one?

30:58.625 --> 30:59.792
Yeah, well,

30:59.875 --> 31:01.417
he doesn't have an alibi
for that night.

31:01.500 --> 31:03.500
And he was pretty sick

31:03.583 --> 31:06.041
in love with
your daughter.

31:07.875 --> 31:09.542
I was looking at her yearbook,

31:09.625 --> 31:12.041
and remembered this boy,

31:12.125 --> 31:14.291
Ann Winters' son.

31:14.375 --> 31:17.542
A few years after Jill died
he said something to Ann

31:17.625 --> 31:20.291
about the Whitleys
getting away with murder.

31:21.542 --> 31:22.792
sighs

31:22.875 --> 31:25.625
Why isn't this in the file?

31:25.709 --> 31:28.083
Well, it should be.
John told it to the police.

31:28.166 --> 31:29.792
LASSING:
What the kid's name?

31:29.875 --> 31:33.834
Charlie Winters.

31:33.917 --> 31:36.125
If Britt talked to him
I'd have a record of it.

31:36.208 --> 31:37.625
He was meticulous.

31:37.709 --> 31:39.417
LASSING:
Well, are you sure

31:39.500 --> 31:41.709
your husband
mentioned it to Britt?

31:41.792 --> 31:43.667
He told me he did.

31:46.875 --> 31:49.625
Could he have
lied, Evelyn?

31:49.709 --> 31:50.667
Well, I don't know.

31:50.750 --> 31:53.583
I mean,
I hounded him about it.

31:53.667 --> 31:54.959
He said it came to nothing.

31:55.041 --> 31:58.291
That I should stop
bringing it up.

31:58.375 --> 32:00.667
Stop pointing fingers
at the Whitleys.

32:00.750 --> 32:02.750
They were a powerful family.

32:04.709 --> 32:08.667
I guess we both know what it's
like to have a husband fail
you.

32:09.709 --> 32:11.709
sighs embarrassingly

32:11.792 --> 32:14.291
We'll find Charlie
Winters, Evelyn.

32:14.375 --> 32:15.583
We'll talk to him,

32:15.667 --> 32:17.875
and we'll let you
know what he says.

32:44.458 --> 32:46.083
sighs

32:46.166 --> 32:47.375
Thanks for coming out.

32:47.458 --> 32:49.000
I can't really leave
the retreat.

32:49.083 --> 32:52.333
Sure. It's about
Jill Shelby.

32:52.417 --> 32:55.041
now

32:55.125 --> 32:57.583
Yeah, you told the cops
you didn't see anything.

32:57.667 --> 32:58.709
Yeah, at first.

32:58.792 --> 33:01.000
But then I came
to the Shelbys

33:01.083 --> 33:04.041
with some good
information,

33:04.125 --> 33:06.166
and I got the brush-off.

33:06.250 --> 33:07.834
You come stoned in your VW van?

33:07.917 --> 33:09.291
So?

33:09.375 --> 33:12.208
Charlie, Evelyn Shelby's the one
who told us about you.

33:12.291 --> 33:14.041
Screw Evelyn Shelby, okay?

33:14.125 --> 33:16.458
I tried to help
her years ago.

33:16.542 --> 33:18.041
She wouldn't hear it.

33:18.125 --> 33:20.750
You're right, Charlie,
but she's not afraid now,

33:20.834 --> 33:22.583
and we want to hear.

33:23.834 --> 33:26.208
sighs
Okay.

33:28.333 --> 33:31.792
I was, um...

33:31.875 --> 33:34.417
<i>kind of passed out</i>
<i>on a lounge chair.</i>

33:34.500 --> 33:35.583
ERIC:
How could this happen?

33:35.667 --> 33:37.291
TODD:
Just shut up.

33:37.375 --> 33:39.375
Why'd you have
to wear this?

33:39.458 --> 33:40.458
What?

33:40.542 --> 33:43.000
It's ruined.

33:44.458 --> 33:47.417
That's what you were
thinking about?

33:47.500 --> 33:48.500
That stupid jacket?

33:48.583 --> 33:50.542
Just leave things to me.

33:57.125 --> 34:01.291
<i>So, they...</i>
<i>got in their car and left,</i>

34:01.375 --> 34:04.792
and, man, I just
got the hell out of there.

34:04.875 --> 34:08.041
Why'd Eric care so much
about the jacket?

34:09.667 --> 34:11.291
There was this...

34:11.375 --> 34:14.917
one year that Eric
did wrestling, and...

34:15.000 --> 34:18.500
Todd couldn't wrestle
to save his life.

34:21.041 --> 34:24.291
I think it was
the only thing that...

34:24.375 --> 34:27.166
he could do better than Todd.

34:29.083 --> 34:31.375
MELANIE:
How was it, good?

34:32.375 --> 34:34.291
I need a couple of minutes.

34:34.375 --> 34:36.417
I... I have
to tell you something

34:36.500 --> 34:38.250
that's going to be
hard to hear.

34:39.500 --> 34:43.125
Todd was seen with
the murder weapon that night.

34:44.417 --> 34:46.333
But I was with him.

34:46.417 --> 34:48.375
You were asleep
after drinking all night.

34:48.458 --> 34:49.792
He could've got
out of bed later.

34:49.875 --> 34:50.834
This is the father
of my children.

34:50.917 --> 34:52.542
He was involved
with a murder,

34:52.625 --> 34:56.208
Melanie-- that's someone
that you don't know very well.

34:56.291 --> 34:59.000
Maybe he was just
covering up for Eric.

34:59.083 --> 35:00.750
Even if that's
all he did,

35:00.834 --> 35:03.583
that's accessory to murder.

35:15.917 --> 35:19.250
I want to tell
you something...

35:19.333 --> 35:21.542
but if I do,
I can't go home.

35:22.500 --> 35:24.375
I can help you with that.

35:24.458 --> 35:27.000
They're talking
every night.

35:27.083 --> 35:29.000
They're arguing.

35:29.083 --> 35:32.041
Todd keeps telling Eric
to stay away from Tabby's.

35:32.125 --> 35:34.417
What's that?
They have an
aunt, Tabitha.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.041
She has a house
in Chestnut Hill.

35:36.125 --> 35:40.083
It was... it was close to
where we all used to live.

35:40.959 --> 35:43.709
Pack a bag for you and the kids.

35:43.792 --> 35:46.500
You're coming with me.

35:55.834 --> 35:58.125
Hey

35:58.208 --> 36:01.000
Where's my wife?

36:01.083 --> 36:02.291
Safe

36:02.375 --> 36:03.834
Come here bitch!

36:03.917 --> 36:05.792
You tell me where she is.

36:05.875 --> 36:08.875
(laughs)
Is this how you handle women
you can't control?

36:09.000 --> 36:10.083
This supposed to scare me?

36:10.166 --> 36:11.750
It's supposed to make you think.

36:11.834 --> 36:15.000
I'm not like the girls you're
used to, Todd.

36:15.083 --> 36:19.750
You can't try to charm me then
when that doesn't work
talk down to me.

36:19.834 --> 36:23.083
Then when that doesn't work,
get agressive.

36:23.166 --> 36:26.125
I'm not Jill or Melanie.

36:26.208 --> 36:32.417
I'm the police and we're at the
police headquarters, you moron.

36:32.500 --> 36:34.208
You gonna talk to me like that?

36:34.291 --> 36:38.917
What are you going to do?
Kill me in the
parking lot of Central?

36:39.000 --> 36:43.500
You think you'll get away with
it again?

36:43.583 --> 36:49.750
I know about Tabby's. I'll have
a warrant tomorrow and guys are
sitting on it right now.

36:49.834 --> 36:55.291
Whatever you hid there, we're
going to find it.

36:55.375 --> 36:59.333
So it's over.

37:02.917 --> 37:04.542
Okay.

37:16.083 --> 37:20.875
I can't protect him anymore.

37:20.959 --> 37:23.083
I did as much as I could.

37:25.125 --> 37:27.917
Why don't you come in and gimme
a statement.

37:32.417 --> 37:34.542
Okay

37:44.458 --> 37:47.667
Flipped on his brother

37:47.750 --> 37:49.333
Do you believe him?

37:49.417 --> 37:53.667
I don't know.
I gotta find Eric.

38:05.417 --> 38:07.041
No meeting tonight, huh?

38:08.041 --> 38:10.500
Screw the meetings.

38:10.583 --> 38:12.542
Scotch and soda

38:12.625 --> 38:15.750
Look I can't talk to you.

38:15.834 --> 38:20.208
My brother chewed me out the day
you came by.

38:20.291 --> 38:23.041
Really, since he's been
talking to me alot.

38:23.125 --> 38:27.500
Yeah well I guess he puts
himself in a different
category.

38:27.583 --> 38:32.041
Oh he told me about you and
Jill
and...

38:32.125 --> 38:34.583
You were in love with her.

38:34.667 --> 38:35.959
She was his girlfriend.

38:40.125 --> 38:43.542
Oh she'd hang around with you
and uh...

38:43.625 --> 38:47.375
...no one was around
but drop you the second
Todd showed up.

38:47.458 --> 38:49.458
Look I already told you that
she was like that.

38:49.542 --> 38:55.333
And then he found you two
together that night.

38:55.417 --> 38:58.917
Look I said I couldn't talk to
you.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.917
What happened to your letter
jacket, Eric?

39:02.000 --> 39:03.709
I don't know.

39:03.792 --> 39:05.083
Another.

39:05.166 --> 39:08.583
I don't think there's time
for another.

39:08.667 --> 39:10.625
I have to arrest you.

39:10.709 --> 39:13.250
He told me you did it.

39:13.333 --> 39:17.750
And that you came to him for
help afterwards and you two
buried the racket at your
aunt's house.

39:17.834 --> 39:20.875
Why would I kill her?

39:20.959 --> 39:25.083
Because she humiliated you.

39:25.166 --> 39:27.917
She accused you
of watching them.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.208
Oh, my God.

39:30.291 --> 39:31.500
So what he's
pinning it on me now?

39:31.583 --> 39:33.750
It's his story against yours.

39:33.834 --> 39:38.000
And you're the problem drunk
who
never got his life together so
if you have anything to give

39:38.083 --> 39:38.834
you should do it now.

39:38.917 --> 39:42.000
Look he ruined my jacket

39:42.083 --> 39:45.542
He got his blood all over it,
hers too.

39:50.500 --> 39:53.125
You didn't throw it out did you?

39:59.875 --> 40:02.834
And Jill didn't humiliate me...

40:05.625 --> 40:07.333
He did.

40:28.417 --> 40:31.667
Hi gorgeous.

40:31.750 --> 40:33.291
Where were you?

40:33.375 --> 40:35.041
Well you can't really ask me
that.

40:35.125 --> 40:36.208
That's my jacket.

40:36.291 --> 40:38.166
So you finally got a taste of
her, huh?

40:38.250 --> 40:39.750
Now you have something real to
jack off to.

40:39.834 --> 40:41.166
Todd!

40:41.250 --> 40:44.208
Huh. Have you seen him in the
window watching us have sex?

40:44.291 --> 40:45.667
That's crazy.

40:45.750 --> 40:48.166
Up in the tree with his hand
down his pants.

40:48.250 --> 40:50.000
Stop! Please.

40:50.083 --> 40:51.750
Well you're the one who just
screwed him.

40:51.834 --> 40:54.166
I didn't screw him.
Give me some credit.

40:54.250 --> 40:55.583
Saw you all pressed up to him.

40:55.667 --> 40:57.208
Only 'cause you
were off with Melanie.

40:57.291 --> 40:58.625
Just stop talking.

40:58.709 --> 40:59.709
Asshole.

40:59.792 --> 41:00.458
Bitch.

41:00.542 --> 41:01.625
Don't.

41:01.709 --> 41:02.875
Shut up!

41:02.959 --> 41:04.709
You're so pathetic!

41:04.792 --> 41:06.667
You're such a prick!

41:06.750 --> 41:08.333
You shut your mouth.

41:08.417 --> 41:09.458
Screw you.

41:09.542 --> 41:14.125
Hey slut,
I said shut your mouth!
