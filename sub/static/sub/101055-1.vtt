00:38.975 --> 00:41.411
<i>Good evening.
I welcome you to the third</i>

00:41.444 --> 00:43.646
<i>and final of the 2016
presidential debates.</i>

00:43.680 --> 00:45.949
<i>We either have
a country, or we don't.</i>

00:45.982 --> 00:47.717
<i>Rounding up
people who are undocumented...</i>

00:47.750 --> 00:48.852
<i>We have some bad hombres here.</i>

00:48.885 --> 00:50.254
<i>...is an idea
that is not in keeping</i>

00:50.287 --> 00:52.789
- <i>with who we are as a nation.</i>
- <i>I tell it like it is.</i>

00:52.822 --> 00:54.657
<i>I'm happy to compare
my 30 years of experience...</i>

00:54.691 --> 00:55.758
<i>The one thing you have</i>

00:55.792 --> 00:57.694
<i>over me is experience,
but it's bad experience.</i>

00:57.727 --> 00:59.662
<i>We are going to make
America great again,</i>

00:59.696 --> 01:01.631
<i>and it has to start now.</i>

01:01.664 --> 01:03.466
<i>I hope you will
give me a chance</i>

01:03.499 --> 01:04.900
<i>to serve as your president.</i>

01:04.934 --> 01:06.970
<i>Donald Trump
told the American people</i>

01:07.003 --> 01:09.639
<i>the truth tonight,
as he always does.</i>

01:09.672 --> 01:11.975
<i>Hillary Clinton
is the real outsider.</i>

01:12.008 --> 01:14.477
Look, whatever you think
you saw tonight...

01:14.510 --> 01:16.512
You didn't.
You actually saw what I saw,

01:16.546 --> 01:17.780
and I think that
the American people...

01:17.814 --> 01:18.781
Would agree with me.

01:18.815 --> 01:20.817
As long as I say it
repeatedly, doggedly...

01:20.850 --> 01:23.186
And with unearned confidence.

01:23.220 --> 01:25.488
I lie.

01:25.521 --> 01:26.756
I am lying to you.

01:26.789 --> 01:27.824
And you know I lie.

01:27.857 --> 01:29.525
I'm actually in this position

01:29.559 --> 01:31.895
because of how effectively
I lie to you.

01:31.928 --> 01:33.463
Are we clear?

01:33.496 --> 01:34.964
We call this the spin room,
without shame.

01:34.998 --> 01:37.934
Spinning is something you do
to disorient people.

01:37.967 --> 01:40.637
And you all know that,
and yet here we are.

01:40.670 --> 01:42.572
What a wonderful play
we're putting on.

01:42.605 --> 01:43.907
Thank you all so much.

01:43.940 --> 01:45.475
And fuck you, America.

01:45.508 --> 01:47.577
I look forward to lying to you
in the future.

01:47.610 --> 01:48.745
See you at the bar.

01:48.778 --> 01:50.947
Thank you.

02:09.966 --> 02:11.235
Shockwaves across America.

02:11.268 --> 02:12.602
His surprise victory

02:12.635 --> 02:13.803
defied preelection polling.

02:13.836 --> 02:15.004
Tectonic-plate-shifting,

02:15.038 --> 02:16.806
9.5 on the Richter scale
earthquake.

02:16.839 --> 02:18.242
So that's just a snapshot

02:18.275 --> 02:19.742
of the reaction
we're getting this morning.

02:19.776 --> 02:21.010
And we're still trying to get

02:21.044 --> 02:23.646
our good old pal Gary Zimmer
to talk to us.

02:23.680 --> 02:25.648
He's probably
halfway to Canada by now.

02:25.682 --> 02:27.550
Yeah,
maybe halfway to Canadian Club.

02:27.583 --> 02:29.953
I'd love to ask this guy
what the hell he was thinking.

02:29.986 --> 02:31.955
How did they blow
this election?

02:31.988 --> 02:34.023
Hey, guys, did you find the clip?

02:34.057 --> 02:35.692
You got it? Okay.

02:35.725 --> 02:37.527
This is our good friend
Gary Zimmer,

02:37.560 --> 02:39.963
grand old consigliere
of the Clinton campaign,

02:39.996 --> 02:42.966
not even a week ago
on this program.

02:42.999 --> 02:44.867
So, you're confident?

02:44.901 --> 02:46.102
Oh, no question.

02:46.135 --> 02:47.837
Hillary's made her case.

02:47.870 --> 02:50.840
She is the most qualified
presidential candidate,

02:50.873 --> 02:52.575
certainly in my lifetime,
maybe ever.

02:52.608 --> 02:54.278
Donald Trump
will not be president.

02:54.311 --> 02:56.746
Well, he is
doing well in the South,

02:56.779 --> 02:59.515
so maybe he can be president
of the Confederacy.

02:59.549 --> 03:01.718
But Ohio,
Michigan, Pennsylvania.

03:01.751 --> 03:03.553
Mika, he's not winning
Pennsylvania.

03:03.586 --> 03:04.887
He's not winning Michigan.

03:04.921 --> 03:07.857
That rust belt blue wall
is impenetrable. It holds.

03:07.890 --> 03:09.092
I guarantee.

03:09.125 --> 03:10.827
Well, you decided to spend

03:10.860 --> 03:12.296
almost no time there
campaigning.

03:12.329 --> 03:13.896
Was that a Carville impression?

03:13.930 --> 03:15.732
All right, so wait a minute.

03:15.765 --> 03:17.600
- Tommy, try Gary again.
- Google, off.

03:17.633 --> 03:19.569
Okay, we have
Faith Brewster on the line...

03:19.602 --> 03:20.703
Hey, Google, off.

03:20.737 --> 03:22.605
Sorry. Power controls
is not yet supported.

03:22.638 --> 03:24.107
Phone lady, decline.

03:24.140 --> 03:26.142
- Try asking again in a different way.
- Ugh.

03:26.175 --> 03:28.745
Hang up. Hey, Google,
tell phone lady to hang up.

03:28.778 --> 03:30.747
Sorry, I'm not sure
how to help with that yet.

03:30.780 --> 03:32.715
- Off, off!
- Sorry, I'm still not sure about that.

03:32.749 --> 03:33.850
Hey, Google, disengage.

03:33.883 --> 03:34.984
- Songs aren't available on SiriusXM.
- Abort.

03:35.018 --> 03:36.253
- I'm not sure about that.
- Everybody, shut up!

03:36.286 --> 03:38.888
Try asking again in a different way.

<i>So, if there is
no further discussion,</i>

06:39.236 --> 06:42.272
<i>can I get a motion to vote
on Resolution 1217,</i>

06:42.306 --> 06:45.942
requiring a valid
Wisconsin driver's license

06:45.975 --> 06:48.945
or proof of U.S. citizenship
to qualify

06:48.978 --> 06:52.114
for any state or municipality
program or benefit,

06:52.148 --> 06:55.985
such as food stamps, welfare
and so on and so forth.

06:56.018 --> 06:57.153
So moved.

06:57.186 --> 06:58.222
- Second?
- Second.

06:58.255 --> 06:59.956
I have a second.
It is time...

06:59.989 --> 07:01.891
- Excuse me, fellas.
- Jack, I already told you,

07:01.924 --> 07:03.360
you can widen that easement
on Hamburg...

07:03.393 --> 07:05.962
Um, actually, it's about

07:05.995 --> 07:08.232
that resolution
you're thinking about passing.

07:08.265 --> 07:11.268
With all due respect, Colonel,
that discussion has ended.

07:11.301 --> 07:13.102
Yeah, yeah. So I heard.

07:13.135 --> 07:15.037
But, uh...

07:15.071 --> 07:17.307
the thing is that, um...

07:17.341 --> 07:19.309
it's a bad idea.

07:19.343 --> 07:21.777
- Y-You can't...
- Uh, okay, well,

07:21.811 --> 07:23.247
I already seconded,
but whatever.

07:23.280 --> 07:25.382
I know we're in
a bad spot, but...

07:25.415 --> 07:27.083
you can't bring it back

07:27.116 --> 07:29.118
by throwing these people
under the bus.

07:29.151 --> 07:31.887
Whoa, we're not throwing
anybody under anything, Jack.

07:31.921 --> 07:33.357
Money was tight

07:33.390 --> 07:36.058
when the base was still open,
but now...

07:36.092 --> 07:37.994
I mean, we just
got to be smart.

07:38.027 --> 07:39.996
We got to eliminate
cheating the programs.

07:40.029 --> 07:42.332
There's not a damn soul
using those programs

07:42.366 --> 07:44.268
that doesn't need 'em,
and you know it.

07:44.301 --> 07:47.237
And all they need to do
is produce the acceptable I.D.,

07:47.271 --> 07:48.572
and the benefits will be...

07:48.605 --> 07:50.340
And you know
they can't do that.

07:50.374 --> 07:53.210
Well...
I don't make the rules, Jack.

07:55.011 --> 07:57.113
I mean, I do, I guess.

07:57.146 --> 08:00.217
Not by myself, but...
this is over.

08:03.052 --> 08:05.222
Okay, we have a motion
that has been seconded.

08:05.255 --> 08:07.291
It is time to bring it
to a vote.

08:07.324 --> 08:09.125
Uh, you know, uh,
just curious...

08:09.158 --> 08:11.328
you know,
when the river backed up

08:11.361 --> 08:13.297
and the folks
you think might be cheating

08:13.330 --> 08:15.831
stood shoulder to shoulder
with us

08:15.865 --> 08:19.303
stuffing sandbags
for three days straight,

08:19.336 --> 08:22.306
ended up saving your store,
you check their I.D.'s then?

08:22.339 --> 08:24.040
Discussion's closed, Jack.

08:24.073 --> 08:25.941
You checking I.D.'s
when they're bringing food

08:25.975 --> 08:28.077
to the church potlucks, Walt?

08:29.145 --> 08:30.414
Enough, Jack.

08:30.447 --> 08:32.215
You had your say.

08:36.018 --> 08:37.986
Look, we got rules here,

08:38.020 --> 08:39.623
but that don't make us
bad people.

08:39.655 --> 08:42.058
I'm not saying
you're a bad person, Billy.

08:42.091 --> 08:44.294
I'm saying you're scared.

08:44.328 --> 08:46.396
Hell, we all are.

08:46.430 --> 08:51.000
Damn town went from 15,000
to five overnight,

08:51.033 --> 08:53.135
and business went with it.

08:53.169 --> 08:56.972
We're not bringing it back
by... by turning on each other.

08:57.973 --> 08:59.343
Corps taught me the chain's

08:59.376 --> 09:01.944
only as strong
as its weakest link.

09:01.977 --> 09:04.914
And Father Heuvel here

09:04.947 --> 09:07.083
taught me that I am
my brother's keeper.

09:07.116 --> 09:08.951
Wait. Go back
to that "weak link" part.

09:08.984 --> 09:11.120
Whatever you do for the least
of us, you do for the Lord.

09:11.153 --> 09:12.289
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

09:12.322 --> 09:14.123
I mean, could this guy work?

09:14.156 --> 09:15.425
Corps taught me the chain's

09:15.459 --> 09:17.893
only as strong
as its weakest link.

09:17.927 --> 09:19.329
Hmm. Pretty good.

09:19.363 --> 09:21.931
- Mm-hmm.
- And Father Heuvel here

09:21.964 --> 09:24.166
taught me that I am
my brother's keeper.

09:24.201 --> 09:27.002
Whatever you do for the least
of us, you do for the Lord.

09:27.036 --> 09:29.306
Looks conservative,
sounds progressive.

09:29.339 --> 09:32.041
- Mm-hmm.
- The point is,

09:32.074 --> 09:36.112
it's easy to be strong
of character in the good times.

09:36.145 --> 09:38.448
The test is the bad times.

09:38.482 --> 09:41.685
If you can't live
your principles then, well...

09:41.718 --> 09:45.020
I guess they aren't principles;
they're just hobbies.

09:46.323 --> 09:47.457
Where is this again?

09:47.491 --> 09:48.924
Wisconsin.

09:48.958 --> 09:51.093
Deerlaken.

09:51.127 --> 09:53.530
- Deerlaken.
- Mm-hmm.

09:53.563 --> 09:55.131
Gentlemen...

09:55.164 --> 09:57.933
this square-jawed paragon
of Americana

09:57.967 --> 10:02.037
is our goddamn key
back into the forbidden city.

10:02.071 --> 10:03.939
- Well, that's my stop.
- Sit. Kurt, sit.

10:03.973 --> 10:05.308
- Call me when he gets to the point.
- Nope.

10:05.342 --> 10:06.443
You're not going anywhere.
No, sit.

10:06.476 --> 10:07.943
And we have Alan to thank

10:07.977 --> 10:09.713
for bringing this man
to our attention.

10:09.746 --> 10:12.215
- It's Evan.
- Did I happen to mention that

10:12.249 --> 10:14.217
he is a veteran of
the United States Marine Corps?

10:14.251 --> 10:16.253
- Yes.
- And a farmer.

10:16.286 --> 10:17.320
- Um... you did.
- I believe so.

10:17.354 --> 10:19.088
And did I happen to mention
that he's a widower?

10:19.121 --> 10:19.989
- Impressive.
- All right. Well done.

10:20.022 --> 10:21.324
A man who makes Joe the Plumber

10:21.358 --> 10:23.025
look like Dukakis in mom jeans

10:23.058 --> 10:24.994
and a fucking Easter bonnet...

10:25.027 --> 10:26.430
in the reddest of counties

10:26.463 --> 10:29.566
- in the great now swing state of Wisconsin...
- Mm-hmm.

10:29.599 --> 10:31.033
...is...

10:32.335 --> 10:34.337
...a Democrat.

10:34.371 --> 10:36.172
Uh, he's a Democrat?

10:36.206 --> 10:37.441
Yeah.

10:37.474 --> 10:39.409
He just doesn't know it yet.

10:39.443 --> 10:41.511
Well, here's the idea:
I get on a plane,

10:41.545 --> 10:44.414
and I go to Wisconsin,
and I use this guy

10:44.448 --> 10:47.317
to road-test a more
rural-friendly message.

10:47.350 --> 10:50.554
It's a mayoral race...
in the middle of nowhere.

10:50.587 --> 10:52.456
Uh, I don't get
how this helps us.

10:52.489 --> 10:55.124
There are two million rural
votes in these states alone.

10:55.157 --> 10:57.227
If we lost them 2.7 to one
instead of three to one,

10:57.260 --> 10:59.396
we'd win,
but we didn't even try.

10:59.429 --> 11:01.096
Their base turned out.
Ours didn't.

11:01.130 --> 11:04.133
If we find a candidate
to activate our base...

11:04.166 --> 11:07.169
if our African Americans

11:07.204 --> 11:08.338
and Latino communities...

11:08.371 --> 11:09.339
It's just "Latino."

11:09.372 --> 11:11.541
...show up, we win.

11:11.575 --> 11:14.076
We have to get the rural voters
back into the tent,

11:14.109 --> 11:15.212
even just a little bit.

11:15.245 --> 11:16.780
Well, if it's all
the same to you,

11:16.813 --> 11:17.914
I'll stick with pandering

11:17.948 --> 11:22.285
to our special-interest groups,
thank you very much.

11:22.319 --> 11:26.490
<i>Sí, se puede. Sí, se puede.</i>

11:26.523 --> 11:29.493
- <i>Sí, se...</i>
- I like the idea of expanding our base.

11:29.526 --> 11:32.496
Not taking any voter
for granted.

11:33.530 --> 11:34.798
It does have some merit.

11:38.335 --> 11:39.101
Good morning.
Gary Zimmer's office.

11:39.134 --> 11:40.370
Okay, so we'll make sure

11:40.403 --> 11:42.037
a car comes here
and picks you up,

11:42.071 --> 11:43.507
- and we'll make sure the driver is Frank.
- Okay.

11:43.540 --> 11:45.107
Um, it's a two-hour flight,

11:45.140 --> 11:46.543
but you'll gain an hour
when you get there.

11:46.576 --> 11:49.279
- What is that?
- The 7 Series.

11:49.312 --> 11:52.047
It was the closest thing
they had to your Tesla, but...

11:52.081 --> 11:54.083
Just take a Sharpie, and write
"liberal city douchebag"

11:54.116 --> 11:55.252
on my forehead, okay?

11:55.285 --> 11:56.586
- Come on, guys.
- Yeah.

11:56.620 --> 11:58.255
Um, Accord?

11:58.288 --> 11:59.556
I'm traveling to America.

11:59.589 --> 12:01.525
Explorer, neutral color.

12:01.558 --> 12:03.192
And pack me like a conference.

12:03.226 --> 12:04.294
Davos? TED?

12:04.327 --> 12:05.829
Aspen, weekend package.

12:05.862 --> 12:07.330
- Thank you.
- Great.

12:07.364 --> 12:08.532
Oh, and, guys, you know what?

12:08.565 --> 12:10.267
Keep it simple.

12:10.300 --> 12:11.401
Simple. No frills.

12:11.434 --> 12:12.602
- Thank you.
- Got it. - Sure.

12:12.636 --> 12:14.136
Great.

12:14.169 --> 12:16.606
Although, if the Explorer
has a-a Bose

12:16.640 --> 12:18.408
or a Bang & Olufsen
sound package,

12:18.441 --> 12:20.343
- if they have it...
- it'd be good.

12:20.377 --> 12:22.546
- Great.
- Gotcha.

12:22.579 --> 12:25.114
Did they say anything
about catering?

12:25.147 --> 12:26.416
Not yet.

12:26.449 --> 12:28.117
Those little mozzarella balls
would be great.

12:28.150 --> 12:29.386
- Yeah?
- Caprese salad.

12:29.419 --> 12:30.687
- Something light. Balsamic.
- Yeah, just...

12:30.720 --> 12:32.255
Balsamic, all that jazz?

12:32.289 --> 12:33.623
Cool.

12:37.527 --> 12:38.595
Nothing.

12:38.628 --> 12:40.129
Cool.

12:40.162 --> 12:42.399
That's fun.

12:44.534 --> 12:45.869
He'll flip the short pass.

12:45.902 --> 12:47.604
Complete to Anderson.
He's at the 35.

12:47.637 --> 12:49.239
He moves to the 30-yard line...

12:49.272 --> 12:51.106
- Here you go, Mr. Zimmer.
- Oh, thank you.

12:51.140 --> 12:52.409
Trailing by three points...

12:52.442 --> 12:53.710
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

12:53.743 --> 12:57.681
...with time running out,
the Packers roll 68 yards

12:57.714 --> 13:01.284
across the frozen field
and into legend.

13:02.719 --> 13:04.354
He flips
the pass. It's complete.

13:04.387 --> 13:06.323
To Chuck Mercein.
He's at the 25, the 20...

13:06.356 --> 13:08.525
With only
three minutes to play,

13:08.558 --> 13:11.528
all the hopes and dreams
of an entire season

13:11.561 --> 13:14.196
rested on the shoulders
of one man.

13:14.230 --> 13:17.601
♪ Like a rhinestone cowboy ♪

13:19.736 --> 13:22.305
♪ Riding out on a horse ♪

13:22.339 --> 13:26.209
♪ In a star-spangled rodeo ♪

13:26.242 --> 13:27.611
♪ Like a rhine... ♪

13:27.644 --> 13:29.245
This is "Fresh Air."

13:29.279 --> 13:30.480
I'm Terry Gross.

13:30.513 --> 13:31.615
Richard Rodgers
and Oscar Hammerstein

13:31.648 --> 13:33.717
had one of the most successful

13:33.750 --> 13:36.386
musical partnerships
of the 20th century.

13:36.419 --> 13:39.356
But I also
think it's-it's a canard

13:39.389 --> 13:41.224
that Hammerstein
can't write funny songs.

13:41.257 --> 13:42.659
She's got a beautiful voice,

13:42.692 --> 13:44.327
so let's hear her singing

13:44.361 --> 13:45.629
"Everybody's
Got a Home but Me."

13:45.662 --> 13:47.464
Will you set the scene for us

13:47.497 --> 13:49.666
about where this song fits
into the show?

13:49.699 --> 13:51.368
Well, this young prostitute

13:51.401 --> 13:53.236
has just arrived in Monterey...

14:00.210 --> 14:02.612
Oh.

14:02.646 --> 14:04.314
- Evening.
- Hey.

14:04.347 --> 14:05.515
Hi. What can I get you?

14:05.548 --> 14:08.518
Uh, how about
a Bud and a burger?

14:08.551 --> 14:11.454
That sounds good.

14:11.488 --> 14:13.623
- Thank you so much.
- Sure thing.

14:13.657 --> 14:15.291
Coming up.

14:16.393 --> 14:17.427
Hey, Charlie.

14:21.231 --> 14:22.766
Tough day?

14:22.799 --> 14:25.268
- A long day, traveling.
- Oh, yeah?

14:25.301 --> 14:27.303
- Where from?
- Washington, D.C.

14:27.337 --> 14:29.539
Man, I ain't been there since,
like, a school trip.

14:29.572 --> 14:31.508
Can't even remember
how many years ago that was.

14:31.541 --> 14:32.575
- It was 29. 29 years.
- Yeah?

14:32.609 --> 14:35.311
- Was it?
- 29 years. Ms. Heuvel's history class.

14:35.345 --> 14:36.680
- That's what it was. Ms. Heuvel's history class.
- Yeah.

14:36.713 --> 14:38.481
Security guards chased us out
of the Space Museum.

14:38.515 --> 14:40.684
Yeah, well, we beat the dog
shit out of those other kids.

14:42.252 --> 14:43.486
Well, you guys aren't
missing anything.

14:43.520 --> 14:45.422
It is a nightmare down there.

14:45.455 --> 14:47.290
- Huh. Yeah.
- Well, no argument there.

14:47.323 --> 14:49.359
- Yeah. You can say that again.
- Mm-hmm.

14:49.392 --> 14:51.594
- Mike Staadt.
- Hey.

14:51.628 --> 14:53.630
- We call him Big Mike.
- Yeah.

14:53.663 --> 14:55.432
People call me Big Mike
for some reason.

14:55.465 --> 14:57.267
Well, it's, uh, because...
to tell us apart.

14:57.300 --> 14:59.402
Because I'm... my name's Mike,
too, but I'm Little Mike.

14:59.436 --> 15:00.704
Hey. How are you? Gary.

15:00.737 --> 15:02.772
- Nice to meet you.
- Gary, Gary.

15:02.806 --> 15:05.375
Gary from D.C.
D.C. Gary.

15:05.408 --> 15:07.343
He likes to give
everybody nicknames, so that's

15:07.377 --> 15:09.245
why he's-he's giving you
a nickname right now, which...

15:09.279 --> 15:10.847
It shows friendship and affection.

15:10.880 --> 15:13.316
- Okay, yeah, but he doesn't...
- If you don't like yours,

15:13.349 --> 15:14.651
- I'll take it away.
- No, I'm fine with my nickname.

15:14.684 --> 15:15.585
Well, I appreciate it,
Little Mike.

15:15.618 --> 15:17.454
Okay, thank you, D.C. Gary.

15:17.487 --> 15:18.855
Hey, this is our new friend,
D.C. Gary.

15:18.888 --> 15:20.657
- Hey. How are you?
- Hey.

15:20.690 --> 15:23.026
- Dave.
- My name is Gary, and I'm from D.C., so...

15:23.059 --> 15:24.027
- that works.
- Well, welcome to Deerlaken.

15:24.060 --> 15:27.030
- Thank you.
- Ever been to Wisconsin before?

15:27.063 --> 15:28.765
Uh, spent a fair amount of time
in Madison.

15:28.798 --> 15:30.467
So that's a no.

15:30.500 --> 15:31.835
That's not Wisconsin.

15:31.868 --> 15:34.504
Actually, I'm here to see
Jack Hastings. You know him?

15:34.537 --> 15:36.606
- Oh, yeah. He's a great guy.
- Yeah, everybody knows Jack.

15:36.639 --> 15:37.807
- The Colonel. Great guy.
- Semper fi.

15:37.841 --> 15:39.476
- Yeah.
- YouTube star.

15:39.509 --> 15:42.278
We've got some rooms upstairs,
if you need.

15:42.312 --> 15:44.447
- Sure. That sounds good.
- Tonya?

15:44.481 --> 15:45.615
Yeah, baby.

15:45.648 --> 15:47.350
This gentleman here
would like a room.

15:47.383 --> 15:49.552
Oh, sure.
What do you need, hon?

15:49.586 --> 15:52.322
Uh, anything.
Any room is fine.

15:52.355 --> 15:53.590
Okay.

15:53.623 --> 15:56.059
If you have something
on a high floor

15:56.092 --> 15:57.761
with a king bed
and a coffee maker...

15:57.794 --> 15:59.696
Okay. Yeah, we... everything's
on the second floor.

15:59.729 --> 16:01.431
- Perfect.
- They're all pretty much the same.

16:01.464 --> 16:03.500
That's perfect. I'm easy.

16:03.533 --> 16:05.668
- Anything's good.
- Take 206. It's the biggest.

16:05.702 --> 16:06.870
- They're all unlocked.
- Okay.

16:06.903 --> 16:08.872
Thank you so much, Tonya.

16:10.673 --> 16:12.542
- Hey, so, D.C. Gary.
- Yeah.

16:12.575 --> 16:14.077
You ever been
to the White House?

16:14.110 --> 16:15.745
- I have.
- What's that like?

16:15.779 --> 16:17.814
What's that like? It's a lot
smaller than you think.

16:17.847 --> 16:19.516
- Thanks.
- What? - Really? -Yeah.

16:19.549 --> 16:21.384
Yeah, 'cause we
didn't... I don't think we got

16:21.417 --> 16:22.519
by there on that student trip.

16:22.552 --> 16:24.320
Must not have been built
at that point.

16:24.354 --> 16:25.789
Oh, that looks delicious.
Thank you so much.

16:25.822 --> 16:27.023
Do you have a bottle opener?

16:27.056 --> 16:29.492
- That's a... no, that's just a twist.
- Bud, you just twist.

16:29.526 --> 16:30.860
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It's a twist-off.

16:30.894 --> 16:32.362
I know. I know.

16:32.395 --> 16:33.663
Maybe he does need
a bottle opener.

16:33.696 --> 16:35.398
- Maybe use your-your vest.
- He's probably...

16:35.431 --> 16:36.933
- Maybe a European grip.
- Ah, I got it.

16:36.966 --> 16:38.535
- There we go.
- There we go.

16:38.568 --> 16:39.636
Cheers.

16:39.669 --> 16:41.104
- Hey.
- Cheers. - Cheers.

16:41.137 --> 16:42.772
- Cheers.
- Here's to you. - Cheers.

16:42.806 --> 16:44.674
Budweiser.

16:44.707 --> 16:47.710
Mmm. Mmm.

16:47.744 --> 16:49.813
Mm-hmm.

16:52.782 --> 16:55.385
You got to be kidding me.

17:01.424 --> 17:03.426
Okay.

17:05.494 --> 17:06.930
All right.

17:06.963 --> 17:08.631
All right.

17:08.665 --> 17:10.465
It's fine, it's fine.

17:10.500 --> 17:12.435
It's fine!

17:12.468 --> 17:13.936
All right.

17:13.970 --> 17:16.839
And it's fucking locked.

17:16.873 --> 17:18.473
Goddamn it.

17:18.508 --> 17:20.609
Oh, shit.

17:20.643 --> 17:23.680
Ah, fuck this.

17:23.713 --> 17:26.583
Oh, Deerlaken.

17:26.616 --> 17:28.483
Love it.

17:36.793 --> 17:39.429
Okay.

17:39.462 --> 17:41.564
Everything all right?

17:41.598 --> 17:43.867
Uh, hel... Yes? Hello?

17:43.900 --> 17:45.635
- It's Dave.
- Yes?

17:45.668 --> 17:46.903
From the Hofbrau House.

17:46.936 --> 17:49.472
- From downstairs?
- Yes.

17:49.505 --> 17:51.407
- O-Okay.
- Everything all right?

17:51.441 --> 17:54.844
Mm... yeah, I was just looking
for a Wi-Fi password.

17:54.878 --> 17:56.613
Good luck.

17:56.646 --> 17:58.414
Case-sensitive?

17:58.448 --> 18:00.583
No, good luck getting Wi-Fi.

18:00.617 --> 18:02.518
You're better off
using your phone.

18:02.552 --> 18:04.554
- Okay.
- Okay.

18:04.587 --> 18:05.822
All right, very good.

18:05.855 --> 18:07.991
- Thank you.
- Sure.

18:08.024 --> 18:10.793
- Goodbye.
- Night, Gar.

18:30.247 --> 18:31.714
Everything all right?

18:47.530 --> 18:49.032
Hey, D.C. Gary!

18:50.700 --> 18:52.936
Hey, Gary.

18:52.969 --> 18:54.504
Hey.

18:55.538 --> 18:56.773
Good morning, Gary.

18:56.806 --> 18:58.708
Hey.

18:58.741 --> 19:00.710
Okay.

19:03.780 --> 19:05.848
- Excuse me, Gary.
- Hi, Gary.

19:05.882 --> 19:08.518
All right.

19:11.020 --> 19:12.822
Well, hello, Gary.

19:14.291 --> 19:15.992
The Mikes told me
that you're up from D.C.,

19:16.025 --> 19:17.860
and I figured that
you might be on the hunt

19:17.894 --> 19:19.629
for some good caffeine.

19:19.662 --> 19:21.965
Yes. Um... sure.

19:21.998 --> 19:23.566
May I have a...

19:23.599 --> 19:25.702
- Coffee?
- A coffee.

19:25.735 --> 19:26.836
Cream, two sugars.

19:26.869 --> 19:29.072
Not how I like it, but good.

19:29.105 --> 19:30.173
And i-if you don't mind, um,

19:30.207 --> 19:32.575
when you head up to Jack's,
can you give him this?

19:32.608 --> 19:33.876
Jack, uh, he gets
a little cranky

19:33.910 --> 19:35.279
if he doesn't get his linzers.

19:35.312 --> 19:37.613
Oh, and I-I, uh...

19:37.647 --> 19:40.284
I put a little streusel
in there for you, too.

19:40.317 --> 19:42.552
Just made it. Still warm.

19:44.120 --> 19:45.989
Mmm. Okay.

19:46.022 --> 19:47.991
Ah, no, no, no, no, no.

19:48.024 --> 19:49.726
You're saving me a trip, so...

19:51.728 --> 19:53.730
Okay.

19:53.763 --> 19:55.798
Um, okay.

19:55.832 --> 19:57.533
Okay.

19:59.035 --> 20:00.837
Bye, Gary.

20:00.870 --> 20:02.872
Okay. Bye.

20:02.905 --> 20:04.640
Have a good one.

20:04.674 --> 20:07.577
Thank you. You have a good one.

20:07.610 --> 20:09.812
Hey, guys.
Have a good one.

20:09.846 --> 20:12.682
Hey, lady. Have a good one.

20:12.715 --> 20:15.151
All right.
Is everybody having a good one?

20:15.184 --> 20:17.754
What the fuck?

20:28.664 --> 20:30.633
Oh, my God.

20:30.666 --> 20:32.635
Oh, fuck!

20:41.378 --> 20:42.845
Oh!

20:42.879 --> 20:44.147
Fuck me!

20:44.180 --> 20:45.915
Oh, God.

20:50.953 --> 20:53.022
Mmm, mmm.

20:53.056 --> 20:54.624
Mmm.

21:06.203 --> 21:07.870
Mmm.

21:23.820 --> 21:26.956
Shit! God! God!

21:30.993 --> 21:33.863
Sunny! Muffin! Stand down!

21:33.896 --> 21:36.099
Oh, hey.

21:36.132 --> 21:39.035
You Ann's new delivery guy?

21:39.068 --> 21:40.803
I'm sorry.

21:40.837 --> 21:42.839
Uh, I'll go back and get you
some more of those.

21:42.872 --> 21:44.707
Oh, it's fine.
I'll probably end up

21:44.740 --> 21:46.676
giving them
most of them anyway.

21:48.845 --> 21:50.980
Um... okay.

21:51.013 --> 21:52.181
Okay.

21:52.216 --> 21:54.617
That's an angry labradoodle.

21:55.452 --> 21:58.788
Oh, really beautiful out here.

21:58.821 --> 22:00.890
Really takes me back.

22:00.923 --> 22:02.825
Oh, you a farm boy?

22:02.859 --> 22:04.827
Uh, uh, no.

22:04.861 --> 22:06.996
Political consultant.

22:08.465 --> 22:10.933
Well, sir, I saw your video
on the Internet...

22:10.967 --> 22:12.702
the town hall you busted up.

22:12.735 --> 22:14.737
Um...

22:14.770 --> 22:16.139
your comments
on the responsibility

22:16.172 --> 22:18.208
to the least of us
moved me deeply.

22:18.242 --> 22:20.877
- Grab a bucket.
- And I'll grab a bucket.

22:20.910 --> 22:22.879
And here they come. Okay.

22:22.912 --> 22:24.747
I think, increasingly...

22:24.780 --> 22:27.884
...we have lost the capacity
to see each other.

22:27.917 --> 22:31.787
Empathy for those
that we don't resemble.

22:31.821 --> 22:33.223
Not to say partisanship
has no place,

22:33.257 --> 22:36.025
but certainly not at the level
of toxicity

22:36.058 --> 22:38.262
that our current debate
incorporates.

22:40.096 --> 22:43.766
"No man left behind"
is your ethos as a Marine!

22:43.799 --> 22:46.869
I think it's especially
poignant this day and age!

22:46.903 --> 22:49.239
Your words spoke to values,
not identity.

22:49.273 --> 22:51.107
So important.

23:11.060 --> 23:12.895
It was Abraham Lincoln
who said,

23:12.929 --> 23:14.830
"An appeal to
our better angels."

23:23.139 --> 23:25.074
You came out of there
pretty fast.

23:25.107 --> 23:26.876
Did you wash?

23:41.824 --> 23:43.025
Okay.

23:43.059 --> 23:45.529
Here it is.

23:45.562 --> 23:48.164
I want you to be
the Democratic candidate

23:48.197 --> 23:50.166
for mayor of Deerlaken.

23:52.068 --> 23:54.338
Now, I know you probably don't
think that you're a Democrat,

23:54.371 --> 23:57.307
but after watching your speech,
I can assure you that you are,

23:57.341 --> 23:59.976
and I would like to offer
my company's services

24:00.009 --> 24:01.744
to help you do so.

24:08.818 --> 24:11.355
Well, I thank you.

24:11.388 --> 24:13.055
You're welcome.

24:13.089 --> 24:15.024
You know,
thanks for the help today.

24:15.057 --> 24:16.826
My pleasure.

24:16.859 --> 24:20.129
But all things being equal,

24:20.162 --> 24:22.164
I'd rather not.

24:25.402 --> 24:27.970
All right.

24:28.004 --> 24:30.806
Can I be completely honest
with you?

24:30.840 --> 24:32.074
No bullshit.

24:32.108 --> 24:33.310
Be nice.

24:33.343 --> 24:35.111
My daughter's here.

24:35.144 --> 24:38.282
That was your daughter,
with her-her arm up the c-cow?

24:38.315 --> 24:40.149
Okay. Look...

24:41.851 --> 24:44.887
- Democrats are getting their asses kicked.
- Mm.

24:44.920 --> 24:49.259
Because guys like me don't know
how to talk to guys like you.

24:49.293 --> 24:52.161
I really believe that
you believe what I believe...

24:52.194 --> 24:55.232
that what is happening
in this town is wrong.

24:55.265 --> 24:58.000
What is happening
in this country is wrong.

24:58.034 --> 24:59.969
People are turning their backs
on each other.

25:00.002 --> 25:02.104
We are forgetting
that we need each other.

25:02.138 --> 25:04.040
What you said in your speech...

25:04.073 --> 25:05.841
strong as our weakest link.

25:05.875 --> 25:07.143
Do you mean that?

25:07.176 --> 25:08.978
Did you mean it
when you said that?

25:09.011 --> 25:12.148
Because if you did, I think
that you have an obligation

25:12.181 --> 25:14.318
to try to strengthen
those weak links.

25:14.351 --> 25:17.321
And you can do it.
You can do it.

25:17.354 --> 25:19.456
You can do it
in this sort of position.

25:19.489 --> 25:23.226
You can help strengthen
those... those weak links.

25:25.462 --> 25:27.830
You can achieve that.

25:31.033 --> 25:33.203
Okay...

25:33.236 --> 25:34.471
All right.

25:34.504 --> 25:36.172
You know what?

25:39.141 --> 25:42.646
All due respect, Colonel,
anybody can make a speech.

25:42.679 --> 25:44.648
The real test is
backing up your words.

25:44.681 --> 25:47.083
The things that you said
to those folks in that meeting,

25:47.116 --> 25:50.253
was that principle,

25:50.287 --> 25:52.289
or was that just a hobby?

25:54.291 --> 25:56.025
Let me know.

25:56.058 --> 25:58.928
Why does he need three guns?

26:25.322 --> 26:27.257
Oh, God.

26:27.290 --> 26:30.260
- Shit.
- I'm sorry if I startled you, sunshine.

26:31.561 --> 26:33.463
Don't you people
believe in locks?

26:33.497 --> 26:37.234
Or privacy
or basic social contracts?

26:37.267 --> 26:39.101
Yeah, Tonya let me in.

26:39.135 --> 26:41.304
I told her I had
something important

26:41.338 --> 26:44.006
I needed to talk to you about.

26:46.008 --> 26:47.411
You'll do it?

26:47.444 --> 26:49.145
Under one condition.

26:49.178 --> 26:50.913
Great. Name it.

26:52.749 --> 26:54.551
You run the damn thing.

26:54.584 --> 26:56.253
I got the farm to worry about.

26:56.286 --> 26:58.120
Don't have any idea
how to even start.

26:58.154 --> 27:01.023
I will have one of my top guys
make himself available to you.

27:01.056 --> 27:02.359
No, no, that's not gonna do it.

27:02.392 --> 27:04.728
You.

27:04.761 --> 27:08.063
The deal is you run it
from here.

27:08.097 --> 27:09.965
I checked you out.

27:09.999 --> 27:12.202
You got one hell
of a portfolio.

27:14.337 --> 27:17.207
So, deal?

27:22.077 --> 27:24.046
I'd like
a big clump of the cows

27:24.079 --> 27:26.081
right here in the center.

27:27.451 --> 27:29.419
- Do you copy me?
- Yes, sir!

27:29.453 --> 27:32.255
Okay. If you can just
move 'em over that way.

27:32.289 --> 27:34.089
- Yep!
- Okay!

27:34.123 --> 27:36.393
And if you could get
some of them to face front.

27:36.426 --> 27:38.060
Oh, my God.

27:38.093 --> 27:40.263
Hey there, Colonel.

27:40.297 --> 27:42.198
Gary.

27:42.232 --> 27:45.302
Bobby, thanks a million
for coming out here.

27:45.335 --> 27:46.603
I'll be certain to vote
for you.

27:46.636 --> 27:48.472
Thank y'all, folks, for coming.

27:48.505 --> 27:50.474
So, this is just
a quick kickoff.

27:50.507 --> 27:53.343
Let's make you look
a little more like Farmer Jack

27:53.376 --> 27:57.414
and less like Certified
Public Accountant Jack.

27:57.447 --> 27:59.583
- There you go.
- Uh, okay.

27:59.616 --> 28:01.218
Oh...

28:01.251 --> 28:02.319
- Oh, no, no. That's okay.
- Quit it.

28:02.352 --> 28:03.353
- That's okay. Donny, right?
- Quit it.

28:03.386 --> 28:04.521
Michael.

28:04.554 --> 28:07.224
Michael, we can just
boom him, okay?

28:07.257 --> 28:08.492
The pole with the thing
on the end.

28:08.525 --> 28:09.793
Do you do sound, Michael?

28:09.826 --> 28:11.294
- Chuck does sound.
- Okay.

28:11.328 --> 28:12.796
But he's at the lake
with his family.

28:12.829 --> 28:14.029
Okay, well, that's too bad
that he's not...

28:14.063 --> 28:16.065
- Eh, that's okay. That's okay. We'll just go without.
- No.

28:16.098 --> 28:17.634
- Thank you, Donny.
- Thank you, son. Thank you.

28:17.667 --> 28:19.168
Okay.

28:19.202 --> 28:20.370
Let's give it a try.

28:20.403 --> 28:21.638
There you are.

28:21.671 --> 28:23.507
Uh, this is...

28:23.540 --> 28:25.342
Why you are running for mayor.

28:26.376 --> 28:27.477
Wow.

28:27.511 --> 28:29.513
I quote Patton...

28:29.546 --> 28:31.080
and Jesus.

28:31.113 --> 28:32.382
Paraphrase.

28:32.415 --> 28:34.484
And you can't go to the prom
without a corsage.

28:36.486 --> 28:38.421
Let's make magic.

28:38.455 --> 28:41.258
All right.
Thank you for coming.

28:41.291 --> 28:43.260
Could we quiet the cows,
please?!

28:43.293 --> 28:45.160
Thank you!

28:45.194 --> 28:48.130
Ladies and gentlemen,
Colonel Jack Hastings.

28:52.302 --> 28:54.204
So, uh,

28:54.237 --> 28:57.541
I am Colonel Jack Hastings,
and...

28:57.574 --> 29:00.443
I'm running for mayor.

29:04.714 --> 29:07.350
So, uh...

29:07.384 --> 29:10.220
How we doing?

29:10.253 --> 29:12.589
All right.
Beautifully put.

29:14.123 --> 29:15.592
Are there any questions
for the Colonel?

29:15.625 --> 29:17.260
Anyone?

29:18.895 --> 29:20.664
Bueller?

29:20.697 --> 29:22.465
Uh, yes, Colonel.

29:22.499 --> 29:24.234
Yes, name and affiliation,
please.

29:24.267 --> 29:26.603
- It's Dan.
- Name and affiliation, please.

29:26.636 --> 29:28.505
I'm Dan.

29:28.538 --> 29:30.206
Go ahead, Daniel.

29:30.240 --> 29:31.474
Easy on the cows!

29:31.508 --> 29:33.610
Um, yes, Mr. Hastings,
uh, Colonel,

29:33.643 --> 29:35.211
could you say that again?

29:35.245 --> 29:37.380
Because I-I don't think
my recorder was on.

29:39.316 --> 29:41.183
Mm. Do it again?

29:41.217 --> 29:42.552
Hey, you know what?

29:42.586 --> 29:43.720
It's okay.

29:43.753 --> 29:45.187
- Now...
- We'll get it.

29:45.221 --> 29:47.290
Okay, this one...

29:47.324 --> 29:49.426
What I'm looking for...

29:49.459 --> 29:52.329
don't put all the black ones
in the center.

29:52.362 --> 29:55.231
He's running as a moderate,
okay?

29:55.265 --> 29:57.400
And if you could get some
facing this way,

29:57.434 --> 29:58.902
that would be helpful.

29:58.935 --> 30:00.704
More local news tonight
out of Deerlaken.

30:00.737 --> 30:02.372
Former Marine Colonel
Jack Hastings

30:02.405 --> 30:04.507
announcing today
that he's running for mayor

30:04.541 --> 30:06.209
as a Democrat.

30:06.242 --> 30:08.211
While Braun may have
an incumbent's advantage,

30:08.244 --> 30:09.446
political insiders say Hastings

30:09.479 --> 30:11.481
is likely to give him
a run for his money.

30:11.514 --> 30:12.916
Happening now, a major...

30:12.949 --> 30:15.585
Well, how much
is this gonna cost?

30:15.619 --> 30:17.921
You let me worry about that.

30:17.954 --> 30:20.189
What I need from you
are people, volunteers.

30:20.223 --> 30:21.491
We got a lot of legwork

30:21.524 --> 30:23.660
if we're gonna make a noise
in this thing.

30:23.693 --> 30:25.495
- More coffee?
- Oh, I'm good.

30:25.528 --> 30:27.297
No, I'm good, Lizzie.
Thanks.

30:27.330 --> 30:28.732
You know what I do need?

30:28.765 --> 30:31.601
I need a couple buckets
of that gravy

30:31.635 --> 30:34.204
so I can take a bath in it.

30:35.271 --> 30:37.374
So good.

30:37.407 --> 30:38.441
Delicious.

30:39.809 --> 30:42.312
My compliments to the chef.

30:42.345 --> 30:43.380
I'll let Ziggy know.

30:43.413 --> 30:44.514
Great.

30:44.547 --> 30:45.715
That ought to cheer him up.

30:45.749 --> 30:48.351
Just the check, Lizzie.

30:48.385 --> 30:50.320
Will do, Jack.

30:50.353 --> 30:53.256
What's the deal
with the happy chef?

30:53.289 --> 30:55.225
Oh, Ziggy's all right.

30:55.258 --> 30:57.227
- Oh?
- He owns the place.

30:57.260 --> 30:59.562
Eh, he may be a bit peeved
about the election thing.

30:59.596 --> 31:02.399
He's Mayor Braun's brother.

31:02.432 --> 31:05.468
Why isn't this place
called Braun's?

31:05.502 --> 31:10.540
The Hansens owned this place
since probably... Korea.

31:10.573 --> 31:13.410
Bobby Hansen started it,
his kids ran it for years,

31:13.443 --> 31:16.446
and had to sell
once the base closed,

31:16.479 --> 31:20.417
but no matter who owns it,
it'll always be Hansen's.

31:20.450 --> 31:23.353
Base closing
really hammered this place.

31:23.386 --> 31:25.221
Yeah, it did.

31:25.255 --> 31:28.224
More than half of
our storefronts have shut down.

31:28.258 --> 31:29.726
In fact, we're losing
our high school

31:29.759 --> 31:31.995
if we can't come up
with the funding.

31:32.028 --> 31:36.499
But no matter what folks
might wish for here,

31:36.533 --> 31:38.401
it ain't coming back.

31:38.435 --> 31:40.503
"Vote for Jack Hastings,

31:40.537 --> 31:42.305
"'cause no matter
what you wish for,

31:42.338 --> 31:44.641
it ain't never coming back."

31:44.674 --> 31:46.409
- I like it. It's good.
- Well...

31:46.443 --> 31:48.645
- I'm not gonna lie to people.
- No, I know. I know.

31:48.678 --> 31:51.581
I was just being witty
and cynical.

31:51.614 --> 31:54.284
Can't win a battle
if you're not honest

31:54.317 --> 31:56.586
about what you're
really up against.

31:56.619 --> 31:58.288
No, you cannot.

31:59.723 --> 32:02.025
Not enough for a bath,

32:02.058 --> 32:04.360
but you can get
a good foot soak in.

32:05.862 --> 32:07.030
Thank you.

32:07.063 --> 32:09.733
A straw.

32:11.735 --> 32:13.336
<i>All right, let's bring it in.</i>

32:13.369 --> 32:14.804
<i>Everybody in. Ah...</i>

32:14.838 --> 32:16.740
- phone bank!
- Phone bank.

32:16.773 --> 32:18.441
Well, you'll get it next time.

32:18.475 --> 32:20.276
Okay, I want you to be upbeat.

32:20.310 --> 32:21.711
I want you to be positive.

32:21.745 --> 32:24.347
Active participation
is what we're looking for.

32:24.380 --> 32:26.316
Would they volunteer?
Would they donate?

32:26.349 --> 32:27.884
Can we drop off a lawn sign?

32:27.917 --> 32:29.819
Would they donate?

32:29.853 --> 32:31.654
Would they donate?

32:31.688 --> 32:34.324
Yes, write that down.
That's good.

32:34.357 --> 32:36.426
Got some sample scripts
for you there.

32:36.459 --> 32:38.294
Contact list there.

32:38.328 --> 32:39.662
To the ramparts!

32:41.531 --> 32:43.366
That means go. You can begin.

32:43.399 --> 32:44.801
- Oh.
- Now...

32:44.834 --> 32:46.736
you guys are my "A" team.

32:46.770 --> 32:49.372
So, first, we're going to take
these lawn signs,

32:49.405 --> 32:52.342
and we're going to put them
in all available public spaces.

32:52.375 --> 32:54.377
I want them visible
but not obnoxiously so.

32:54.410 --> 32:57.514
Isn't it a little early
for lawn signs?

32:59.382 --> 33:01.351
I'm sorry. She just, um...

33:01.384 --> 33:02.519
'Cause just around here,

33:02.552 --> 33:04.387
sometimes people
aren't so keen...

33:04.420 --> 33:06.589
- Mm-hmm.
- But then, I do appreciate

33:06.623 --> 33:08.424
that you got the signs made.

33:08.458 --> 33:10.360
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean, we've always used lawn signs.

33:10.393 --> 33:12.495
- Yeah.
- They've worked for hundreds of years, so...

33:12.529 --> 33:14.097
- Great.
- Yeah, let's just use 'em.

33:14.130 --> 33:16.332
Great. All right, Ann?

33:16.366 --> 33:18.334
- Hmm? Okay.
- I want you to take the downtown area.

33:18.368 --> 33:20.637
Martha, Dave, how about
everything west of 39?

33:20.670 --> 33:22.672
And, Diana, I'd like you to stay here...

33:22.705 --> 33:24.407
- Hello?
- Yeah?

33:24.440 --> 33:25.775
- ...to do...
- Good morning.

33:25.809 --> 33:27.544
Hi. This is Matthew,
and I'm a volunteer

33:27.577 --> 33:28.745
- calling with Jack...
- Matthew?

33:28.778 --> 33:29.846
- Matt... Matthew...
- Hello?

33:29.879 --> 33:31.681
Hello?

33:31.714 --> 33:33.416
What are you doing?

33:33.449 --> 33:35.485
- Zimmer.
- Good morning, Mr. Zimmer.

33:35.518 --> 33:37.921
My name is Michael, calling
on behalf of Colonel Hastings.

33:37.954 --> 33:40.423
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

33:40.456 --> 33:41.758
All right, this is
what's happening here.

33:41.791 --> 33:43.960
You're calling off
the office contact list.

33:43.993 --> 33:45.662
This is the voter contact list.

33:45.695 --> 33:47.664
- Oh.
- So, yeah, I know.

33:47.697 --> 33:50.533
I want you to call
the voter contact list.

33:50.567 --> 33:51.935
We're already voting
for the Colonel.

33:51.968 --> 33:53.636
Okay? Good.

33:53.670 --> 33:55.438
Let's go do the signs, too.

33:55.471 --> 33:56.773
Oh, my God.

33:56.806 --> 33:58.975
Keep doing that, guys.

34:06.816 --> 34:09.452
Gar! Hey, D.C. Gary!

34:09.485 --> 34:12.487
- Hi.
- Hey, Gar, come on over.

34:12.522 --> 34:14.623
Okay. All right.

34:14.657 --> 34:16.458
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

34:16.492 --> 34:17.860
Uh, that's a six.
That is a five.

34:17.893 --> 34:19.395
And a four. Look at that.

34:19.429 --> 34:20.597
- And a seven.
- Oh, my... Oh!

34:20.630 --> 34:22.465
I'm keeping it, baby!

34:22.498 --> 34:24.500
- Ah!
- Hey, everybody.

34:24.534 --> 34:25.935
- Hey.
- This is D.C. Gary.

34:25.969 --> 34:28.471
He's staying above the Hofbrau.

34:28.504 --> 34:29.672
- Hey.
- Good to see you.

34:29.706 --> 34:30.639
Welcome to
The Ambassador's Lounge.

34:30.672 --> 34:31.908
Thank you very much.

34:31.940 --> 34:33.509
Hear you're in town
helping the Colonel.

34:33.543 --> 34:34.911
- Yes, I am.
- He's a good man.

34:34.944 --> 34:36.713
He is. He is a good man.

34:36.746 --> 34:39.449
So, is this your
campaign office here?

34:39.482 --> 34:41.484
This?

34:41.516 --> 34:43.585
No, this is
The Ambassador's Lounge,

34:43.620 --> 34:47.023
an elite, uh, social club of
the area's top entrepreneurs,

34:47.056 --> 34:49.692
- athletes and raconteurs.
- Ah.

34:49.726 --> 34:51.460
It's a shithole.

34:51.494 --> 34:52.594
Hey, guys.

34:52.629 --> 34:54.764
Jack's already got lawn signs
printed up.

34:58.801 --> 35:01.037
Well, I got to head out.

35:01.070 --> 35:02.972
Got a lot of work
to catch up on.

35:03.006 --> 35:04.607
Pleasure meeting everybody.

35:04.641 --> 35:06.509
Hey, Father,
you want to go with him?

35:06.542 --> 35:07.777
He might need a miracle or two.

35:07.810 --> 35:09.679
This town hasn't had
a Democrat mayor

35:09.712 --> 35:11.881
since La Follette
ruled these parts, and...

35:11.915 --> 35:14.651
hasn't had a Democratic Party
since the '70s.

35:14.684 --> 35:15.919
Gonna take a little bit more

35:15.952 --> 35:17.820
than lawn signs.

35:18.922 --> 35:20.623
Okay.

35:28.498 --> 35:30.566
<i>Colonel Jack Hastings.</i>

35:30.600 --> 35:32.035
<i>Tempered by war.</i>

35:32.068 --> 35:35.038
Chain's only as strong
as its weakest link.

35:35.071 --> 35:37.540
<i>Driven by faith.</i>

35:37.573 --> 35:39.609
I am my brother's keeper.

35:39.642 --> 35:41.778
<i>A new kind of Democrat.</i>

35:41.811 --> 35:44.580
<i>A Democrat for the heartland.</i>

35:44.614 --> 35:47.984
Jack Hastings,
a redder kind of blue.

35:48.017 --> 35:50.553
Paid for
by Real Americans for...

35:50.586 --> 35:52.956
What are you up to, Zimmer?

35:52.989 --> 35:56.059
I am telling you guys,
Jack could be the real deal,

35:56.092 --> 35:57.694
on a national level.

35:57.727 --> 35:58.928
On a national level?

35:58.962 --> 36:01.898
It's like he's a cross
between...

36:01.931 --> 36:04.934
- MacArthur and elk jerky.
- Wait, what?

36:04.968 --> 36:07.537
And one of those machines
that test grip strength.

36:07.570 --> 36:09.273
Sounds too good to be true.

36:09.306 --> 36:11.007
Oh, my God.

36:11.040 --> 36:13.609
Semicolon.

36:13.643 --> 36:15.712
She took the bait.

36:15.745 --> 36:18.481
It's on here, boys.
Game on.

36:21.084 --> 36:22.885
- And let him be the star, you know?
- Yeah.

36:22.919 --> 36:24.587
- Yep.
- So...

36:24.620 --> 36:27.090
♪ A little bit
of Hastings all the time ♪

36:27.123 --> 36:29.859
♪ We're gonna win election,
yeah, yeah, yeah. ♪

36:29.892 --> 36:32.296
Oh, yeah. Oh, here I am.

36:32.329 --> 36:34.298
Yes. Hello, party people.

36:34.331 --> 36:37.133
Oh, 'tis a beautiful day
to be alive

36:37.166 --> 36:38.868
and on the vanguard of change.

36:38.901 --> 36:40.903
Who wants something to eat?

36:40.937 --> 36:42.538
They're so delicious.

36:45.141 --> 36:47.110
Okay.

36:47.143 --> 36:48.711
What's going on?

36:48.745 --> 36:50.680
Why all the long faces?

36:50.713 --> 36:51.881
Did you not see it?

36:51.914 --> 36:54.318
The billboard.

36:54.351 --> 36:57.820
The one on Main with the giant
"Vote for Mayor Braun"?

36:57.854 --> 36:59.122
- Yes.
- What about it?

36:59.155 --> 37:00.890
"What about it?"

37:00.923 --> 37:02.859
That's the
Macgregor Ford billboard.

37:02.892 --> 37:04.560
Okay.

37:04.594 --> 37:05.895
Okay, so it's been
the Macgregor Ford billboard

37:05.928 --> 37:07.030
for probably 40 years.

37:07.063 --> 37:08.265
God only knows
how much it cost.

37:08.298 --> 37:11.067
And it looks like Braun has
taken over Jerry's old office

37:11.100 --> 37:12.769
as some sort of
campaign headquarters.

37:12.802 --> 37:14.904
Wait a second. Wait a second.
Hold on. Hold on.

37:14.937 --> 37:17.341
Um, are you telling me
that the mayor,

37:17.374 --> 37:19.575
who's running for reelection,

37:19.609 --> 37:23.579
has decided to advertise
his campaign for mayor?

37:23.613 --> 37:26.916
And he's doing it from a...
campaign office?

37:26.949 --> 37:29.185
Oh, my God!
Oh, I... This is...

37:29.219 --> 37:31.187
This is overwhelming to me.

37:31.221 --> 37:32.755
Oh, my God.

37:32.789 --> 37:34.057
I don't... I...

37:34.090 --> 37:35.058
What...

37:35.091 --> 37:36.826
I have the vapors. I...

37:36.859 --> 37:37.994
I'm hyperventilating.

37:38.027 --> 37:40.029
Why are these spoons
just standing there?

37:40.063 --> 37:41.697
You don't get it.

37:42.932 --> 37:44.734
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

37:44.767 --> 37:46.370
You don't get it.

37:46.403 --> 37:48.604
Do you have any idea
how much that costs?

37:48.638 --> 37:50.173
Well, that space
is 3,800 square feet,

37:50.207 --> 37:52.875
and it runs for
$20 a square foot yearly.

37:52.909 --> 37:56.045
Prorated to two months
is $7,600.

37:56.079 --> 37:59.082
The billboard, a little bit
harder to decipher.

37:59.115 --> 38:01.184
But I'd say,
based on the location

38:01.218 --> 38:04.687
and Mayor Braun's desperation,
8K all-in.

38:04.720 --> 38:06.089
Design and printing included.

38:06.122 --> 38:08.724
I don't know,
maybe something like that.

38:08.758 --> 38:11.094
Well, there's no way that
Braun's got that much money.

38:11.127 --> 38:14.097
Unless... this little
campaign of ours

38:14.130 --> 38:17.700
has caught the attention of
the national Republican Party

38:17.733 --> 38:20.703
and they are sending money
and reinforcements.

38:20.736 --> 38:22.138
It's okay.

38:22.171 --> 38:25.141
It's exactly what
we wanted to happen.

38:26.210 --> 38:28.111
They are scared.

38:28.144 --> 38:30.713
On a national level,

38:30.746 --> 38:33.783
they are scared
of Colonel Jack.

38:35.252 --> 38:37.854
So we have to plan
our next move.

38:37.887 --> 38:39.155
Come here.

38:40.290 --> 38:41.924
Gather round.

38:41.958 --> 38:44.093
We're going to need...

38:44.127 --> 38:46.796
something a little like...

38:46.829 --> 38:48.865
that.

38:50.133 --> 38:52.001
Wow.

38:54.103 --> 38:55.671
And you scroll down.

38:55.705 --> 38:57.241
There's a "donate" button.

38:57.274 --> 39:00.843
Well, the money be
just one clicky away.

39:00.877 --> 39:03.779
And one clicky goes to where?

39:03.813 --> 39:05.014
Our website.

39:05.047 --> 39:07.683
Oh, we don't have a web...

39:09.852 --> 39:11.020
Oh, wow.

39:11.053 --> 39:13.689
Awesome.

39:13.723 --> 39:15.225
Good slogan, right?

39:15.259 --> 39:17.126
You were one step ahead
the whole time.

39:17.160 --> 39:19.729
Well, three or four,
but thank you very much.

39:19.762 --> 39:20.963
I will take that.

39:20.997 --> 39:22.466
Oh, wow.

39:48.824 --> 39:50.294
Mmm.

39:52.061 --> 39:54.030
Mmm.

39:54.063 --> 39:56.766
Know how I knew you were here?

39:56.799 --> 39:58.768
Your pussy tingled.

39:59.869 --> 40:01.971
Semicolon on the billboard.

40:02.004 --> 40:05.074
Classic Faith Brewster
over-punctuation.

40:05.107 --> 40:07.877
Look, Zim,
y'all punched your ticket

40:07.910 --> 40:11.914
on a changing demographic, and
now whitey don't want you back.

40:11.948 --> 40:15.785
Okay, Jeb, exclamation point.

40:15.818 --> 40:17.820
Why are you here?

40:17.853 --> 40:19.922
Because I enjoy
demoralizing you.

40:19.956 --> 40:22.226
Because crushing the last
piece of hope in your eyes

40:22.259 --> 40:23.826
really gets me off.

40:25.828 --> 40:28.898
You are a twisted fuck, Faith.

40:28.931 --> 40:31.000
And you don't know Jack.

40:31.033 --> 40:32.969
Please don't tell me that is

40:33.002 --> 40:35.771
the campaign slogan
you came up with.

40:38.007 --> 40:40.109
This guy, Zim,
he's not the last Jedi,

40:40.142 --> 40:42.078
and even if he were,
I'd still crush him

40:42.111 --> 40:43.846
because that's what I do.

40:43.879 --> 40:45.848
You realize, in that analogy,
you're Darth Vader.

40:45.881 --> 40:47.850
Whatever you say, nerd.

40:47.883 --> 40:49.118
- It's good to see you.
- Yeah.

40:49.151 --> 40:51.087
You look fat.

40:54.291 --> 40:56.226
Hmm.

40:56.260 --> 40:57.793
Divine, Ann.

40:57.827 --> 41:00.162
- You have to tell me your secret sometime.
- Mm.

41:03.132 --> 41:04.834
I would never tell you.

41:05.868 --> 41:07.870
I'll never tell her.

41:07.903 --> 41:10.006
- Cream, two sugars.
- Oh.

41:10.039 --> 41:12.141
- No, that's not how I take it.
- I know, but...

41:12.174 --> 41:13.943
Um, and here-here's
some streusel I made for you,

41:13.976 --> 41:15.579
- and, um, it's still warm.
- No, no, no, no, Ann, I can't.

41:15.612 --> 41:17.146
- And then these are cookies I made for you.
- I can't.

41:17.179 --> 41:18.180
- I'm getting fat. I can't do that.
- They're...

41:18.215 --> 41:19.081
- They're called the Garys, though.
- Thank you.

41:19.115 --> 41:20.883
- I made these...
- I know. I appreciate it.

41:20.916 --> 41:21.685
- Thank you. Okay.
- Yeah. Okay.

41:21.718 --> 41:22.952
- Okay, bye-bye.
- All right, then.

41:22.985 --> 41:23.986
Thank you. All right, then.

41:24.020 --> 41:25.054
- Bye-bye. Have a good day.
- Okay.

41:25.087 --> 41:27.123
Up all night for nothing.

41:27.156 --> 41:28.924
- Coming back. There you go.
- All right, just today.

41:28.958 --> 41:30.192
- Okay.
- Yeah. Thank you.

41:30.227 --> 41:31.595
Bye-bye, now. Bye-bye.

41:31.628 --> 41:33.062
Bye, Gar.

41:34.897 --> 41:36.233
Have a good one.

41:53.015 --> 41:55.184
- Okay, good night.
- Oh, hey.

41:55.218 --> 41:57.186
Good night. I didn't know
anybody else was here.

41:57.220 --> 41:58.388
I just wanted to make sure

41:58.422 --> 42:00.257
everything was set
for tomorrow.

42:00.290 --> 42:02.858
I was just finishing up
these pamphlets on immigration.

42:02.892 --> 42:04.093
Ooh.

42:04.126 --> 42:05.462
That sounds complicated.

42:05.495 --> 42:07.230
I hope the small minds
can manage.

42:09.065 --> 42:10.634
I'm sorry about that.

42:10.667 --> 42:13.303
Sometimes,
messaging for the base

42:13.337 --> 42:16.839
doesn't resonate
with the broader electorate.

42:17.674 --> 42:20.210
Oh, okay.

42:20.243 --> 42:24.914
So, to flatter them,
you have to condescend to us.

42:26.115 --> 42:28.218
I get it.

42:28.251 --> 42:31.120
Uh, no, no, that wasn't...

42:31.153 --> 42:33.256
that wasn't what...

42:38.228 --> 42:40.230
Sorry.

42:42.064 --> 42:43.500
How's your dad doing?

42:43.533 --> 42:45.435
Is he okay? Nervous?

42:45.469 --> 42:47.471
No.

42:47.504 --> 42:50.273
No? Well, why would he be?
He's been through a war.

42:50.307 --> 42:52.007
He's not gonna sweat
a fish fry.

42:52.041 --> 42:54.244
- No, he doesn't really get nervous.
- Mm-mm.

42:54.277 --> 42:56.178
Just quiet.

42:57.214 --> 42:59.081
Right.

43:03.553 --> 43:05.489
Runs in the family.

43:09.426 --> 43:13.162
- Maybe.
- Oh.

43:14.163 --> 43:15.499
Yes, my, uh...

43:15.532 --> 43:19.503
my mom was really
more of the talker.

43:19.536 --> 43:22.305
She was...

43:24.039 --> 43:26.443
You ever know anyone
that just lit up a room?

43:29.279 --> 43:30.480
Mm-hmm.

43:30.514 --> 43:32.181
Well, she was that.

43:32.215 --> 43:33.717
Yeah.

43:33.750 --> 43:35.452
- She sounds great.
- Yeah.

43:37.153 --> 43:40.122
So, why did your dad
get involved with all this?

43:40.156 --> 43:43.058
I mean, why speak
at that meeting?

43:43.092 --> 43:47.330
Why run when it involves
talking and people?

43:49.198 --> 43:52.502
I think he just loves
this town.

43:52.536 --> 43:56.473
You know, I think he'd do
anything to save it.

43:56.506 --> 43:58.974
What about you?

44:01.578 --> 44:04.347
Uh, I guess I would do

44:04.381 --> 44:08.050
just about anything
to save him.

44:19.329 --> 44:21.264
Okay. You have a good day, now.

44:21.298 --> 44:23.098
I'll just take one.

44:25.502 --> 44:27.204
Hey. How are you this evening?

44:27.237 --> 44:29.573
Pamphlet?
Vote for Colonel Jack.

44:29.606 --> 44:31.775
Colonel Jack pamphlet.

44:31.808 --> 44:33.477
Vote for Colonel Jack.

44:35.512 --> 44:37.247
How are y'all doing?

44:37.280 --> 44:38.515
...incredible database.

44:38.548 --> 44:40.383
- Yeah.
- And all your information is in there.

44:49.559 --> 44:51.628
Hey, Gary. Sorry I'm late.

44:51.661 --> 44:54.129
I was just waiting for these
to get finished.

44:54.163 --> 44:55.632
Beer Koozies might be
a little more helpful

44:55.665 --> 44:57.267
than just the pamphlets.

44:58.535 --> 45:01.103
And this is
actually very simple.

45:01.136 --> 45:03.306
You just type in
your family's name...

45:03.340 --> 45:05.442
How big is that booth?

45:08.411 --> 45:09.813
- Faith.
- Gary.

45:09.846 --> 45:12.382
You seem to be doing
a brisk business.

45:12.415 --> 45:14.217
"Deerlaken: always."

45:14.251 --> 45:16.185
So, apparently,

45:16.219 --> 45:18.321
"Deerlaken über alles"
was copyrighted?

45:18.355 --> 45:20.223
Well, we were gonna go with
"I'm with him"

45:20.257 --> 45:22.057
until we remembered
how fucking stupid it sounded.

45:22.091 --> 45:23.460
No, no, no, no.
I love it.

45:23.493 --> 45:25.629
I love the whole
town genealogy angle.

45:25.662 --> 45:27.464
It's got a real bold

45:27.497 --> 45:29.466
"you ain't from around here"
flavor.

45:29.499 --> 45:31.434
With subtle notes of,

45:31.468 --> 45:33.270
uh, xenophobia.

45:33.303 --> 45:35.272
Not to mention
the cognitive dissonance

45:35.305 --> 45:37.574
that your booth is basically
a love letter to immigration.

45:37.607 --> 45:39.074
That's a great observation.

45:39.108 --> 45:40.577
So all these people
are hypocrites?

45:40.610 --> 45:42.479
- I'd run with that.
- All you have is fear.

45:42.512 --> 45:43.847
Now we're getting somewhere.

45:43.880 --> 45:45.549
20 bucks says
I do better with fear

45:45.582 --> 45:46.850
than you do with shame.

45:46.883 --> 45:48.117
- Oh.
- Okay.

45:48.150 --> 45:49.386
It's all set, Miss Brewster.

45:49.419 --> 45:51.288
Thank you, sweetie.

45:51.321 --> 45:53.557
Well, well, well.

45:53.590 --> 45:55.492
I'm really sorry, Mr. Z.

45:55.525 --> 45:57.527
I like working
with you guys, but...

45:57.561 --> 45:59.629
I'm saving up for a car,
and she's paying us.

45:59.663 --> 46:01.464
"Eh, she's paying us."

46:01.498 --> 46:05.702
Wow, way to stand up for
what you believe in there...

46:05.735 --> 46:08.338
- M... Michael.
- It's Michael.

46:08.371 --> 46:10.273
- Michael. I know his name is Michael.
- His name is Michael.

46:10.307 --> 46:11.474
- No, you don't.
- I know it.

46:11.508 --> 46:13.510
- I was pausing for effect, Michael.
- It's okay, Michael.

46:13.543 --> 46:16.413
- Character is destiny, Michael.
- Oh, don't listen to him.

46:16.446 --> 46:18.348
- Character is destiny.
- He's a jerk. Oof.

46:18.381 --> 46:19.649
Good burn.

46:19.683 --> 46:21.585
Jack has lived here
for 30 years.

46:21.618 --> 46:23.453
You really think
you can run a campaign

46:23.486 --> 46:25.455
that paints him
as a carpetbagger?

46:25.488 --> 46:28.190
Probably not, but I think I can
run one that says you are.

46:28.224 --> 46:29.593
- Beer Koozie?
- Oh, my God.

46:31.227 --> 46:33.463
Oh. Hastings Koozie?

46:33.496 --> 46:35.465
- Yeah.
- Touché.

46:35.498 --> 46:36.633
That's right.
That's in our booth.

46:36.666 --> 46:38.668
- What do you think of that?
- Yeah, I'll take one.

46:38.702 --> 46:41.204
What do you think of that
right there?

46:41.237 --> 46:43.406
Boom, boom. What do you think of that?

46:43.440 --> 46:45.308
- I don't...
- Oh.

46:45.342 --> 46:47.377
Sorry. Not you, Dot.

46:48.645 --> 46:50.614
- Hi.
- Oh, Dot.

46:57.253 --> 46:58.722
Oh.

47:08.498 --> 47:10.500
Oh.

47:22.612 --> 47:24.280
Whoa.

47:40.630 --> 47:42.499
We're not doing this.

47:42.532 --> 47:43.667
What?

47:43.700 --> 47:45.535
Ugh.

47:45.568 --> 47:48.571
You go through my stuff?

47:50.273 --> 47:52.208
Why here?
You have your own room.

47:52.242 --> 47:53.710
I don't want to smoke alone.

47:53.743 --> 47:55.311
Oh, come on. Are...

47:55.345 --> 47:56.646
Really?

47:58.415 --> 48:01.484
Gary, I'm bored.

48:01.518 --> 48:03.553
Please, can we just forget it?

48:03.586 --> 48:04.721
You've made your point.

48:04.754 --> 48:06.423
There's Democrats
with calloused hands.

48:06.456 --> 48:09.259
Gonna bode very well
for the midterms, I promise.

48:09.292 --> 48:10.727
Now, can we just all go back
to Washington

48:10.760 --> 48:13.229
and forget that we ever
made camp in a place

48:13.263 --> 48:15.699
where the shit you skim
off milk is considered a food?

48:15.732 --> 48:18.368
They are called cheese curds,
and they are delicious.

48:18.401 --> 48:19.536
They're disgusting.

48:19.569 --> 48:21.371
And you can't make poutine
without them.

48:21.404 --> 48:22.806
- Come on. Please.
- Go.

48:22.839 --> 48:24.774
You can go.
You don't have to be here.

48:24.808 --> 48:26.543
I made these people a promise.

48:26.576 --> 48:27.811
I'm a good person.

48:27.844 --> 48:29.345
It's your last chance, Zim.

48:29.379 --> 48:30.814
I'm gonna make
a big deal of this.

48:30.847 --> 48:33.516
Tons of press, lots of money.
You're gonna lose,

48:33.550 --> 48:35.518
and then you're gonna look
like a giant asshole.

48:35.552 --> 48:37.020
Good. That's what I want.

48:37.053 --> 48:40.690
Not the asshole but for you
to make a big deal of this.

48:40.724 --> 48:43.326
I want it to be a big deal.
It is a big deal.

48:43.359 --> 48:44.828
Well, let's make it
interesting.

48:44.861 --> 48:45.995
Okay, why don't we?

48:46.029 --> 48:49.599
The loser has to eat the
winner's pussy out for an hour.

48:49.632 --> 48:53.369
You better grab a big old bib,
'cause it's chow time.

48:54.671 --> 48:56.339
Dick chow time.

48:56.372 --> 48:57.874
'Cause I'm gonna win,

48:57.907 --> 49:00.744
- and you're gonna have to eat my dick for an hour.
- Wha...

49:00.777 --> 49:02.479
And you know something?

49:02.512 --> 49:04.547
That's a long time,
dick-eating-wise.

49:06.750 --> 49:08.885
A long time!

49:08.918 --> 49:11.287
To eat my dick.

49:15.391 --> 49:16.860
<i>In a dangerous world</i>

49:16.893 --> 49:18.628
<i>gone mad...</i>

49:18.661 --> 49:20.897
<i>we need emotionally stable
leadership.</i>

49:23.399 --> 49:25.668
<i>Only Mayor Braun
is stable enough</i>

49:25.702 --> 49:27.904
<i>to keep Deerlaken safe,</i>

49:27.937 --> 49:30.507
<i>to keep Deerlaken Deerlaken.</i>

49:32.342 --> 49:33.810
I got you.

49:33.843 --> 49:36.813
I'm Mayor Braun,
and I approve this message.

49:36.846 --> 49:38.081
Here.

49:38.114 --> 49:40.517
<i>Paid for by
Traditional Wisconsin Families</i>

49:40.550 --> 49:41.851
<i>for Faith and Freedom.</i>

49:44.754 --> 49:46.790
They've taken the office
just across from mine.

49:46.823 --> 49:48.091
They're definitely ramping up,

49:48.124 --> 49:50.426
so I'm gonna need
the full crew.

49:50.460 --> 49:53.463
If Zimmer wants to take a stand
in Turdsville, USA,

49:53.496 --> 49:55.098
I say we bury him here.

49:55.131 --> 49:56.566
Sorry.

49:56.599 --> 49:57.834
Not a turd.

49:57.867 --> 49:59.669
Heart and soul of America.

49:59.702 --> 50:01.671
Get me the nerdy guy
from analytics.

50:01.704 --> 50:04.374
- Who's that?
- I don't know his name.

50:04.407 --> 50:06.109
He wears glasses and plaid.

50:06.142 --> 50:08.378
- Has a very complicated beard.
- Which one?

50:08.411 --> 50:11.447
How the fuck does that
not narrow it down? I...

50:11.481 --> 50:13.716
- God fucking damn it.
- What?

50:13.750 --> 50:16.419
And send me everyone
by yesterday.

50:16.452 --> 50:17.821
I'll get on it.

50:30.466 --> 50:31.935
Sor... Hey, Dot.

50:34.771 --> 50:36.372
- Gary.
- Hey, big guy?

50:36.406 --> 50:38.441
- Yes.
- We got a problem.

50:39.742 --> 50:40.910
What's up?

50:40.944 --> 50:43.413
Having trouble
rounding up focus groups?

50:43.446 --> 50:44.581
No.

50:44.614 --> 50:45.882
Shh.

50:49.185 --> 50:51.521
I don't even know what to say.

50:51.554 --> 50:53.723
Hey, hey, everybody.

50:53.756 --> 50:56.559
Do we know why we have dial-up
in this space?

50:56.593 --> 50:57.760
Duffy had it upgraded

50:57.794 --> 50:59.629
right before
he closed the shop.

50:59.662 --> 51:00.663
Upgraded from what?

51:01.898 --> 51:03.900
- Nothing.
- Well, is there any way

51:03.933 --> 51:06.002
we can piggyback Wi-Fi
from someplace?

51:06.035 --> 51:08.671
Uh, there's a place where the
kids go and they do homework

51:08.705 --> 51:09.873
and they play games
and whatnot.

51:09.906 --> 51:12.575
- I know the password.
- Okay.

51:12.609 --> 51:14.644
- Solving problems.
- Nice!

51:25.822 --> 51:29.759
Listen, I... I don't think
you're allowed to be here

51:29.792 --> 51:32.896
unless you're on official
school business, so...

51:32.929 --> 51:35.565
Okay, look, uh, Officer...

51:35.598 --> 51:37.467
- Tommy.
- Officer Tommy.

51:37.500 --> 51:40.003
Um, we are with
the Hastings campaign,

51:40.036 --> 51:42.572
and we're trying to get
some work done here.

51:42.605 --> 51:44.007
It's sort of time-sensitive.

51:44.040 --> 51:47.043
So... um, okay, here we go.

51:47.076 --> 51:48.978
Here is a pen.

51:49.012 --> 51:51.215
- Okay.
- And...

51:51.248 --> 51:53.650
- one of these beer thingies.
- Koozie.

51:53.683 --> 51:56.519
Koozie, and, uh...

51:56.552 --> 51:58.721
thank you for your service.

52:11.868 --> 52:14.604
Oh, for God sakes.

52:15.939 --> 52:18.975
Hello, boys.

52:19.008 --> 52:20.843
Gentlemen, these are children!

52:20.877 --> 52:22.612
- Hey. - Hi.
- Children!

52:22.645 --> 52:25.048
- Great job, guys.
- And do you know what that looked like?

52:25.081 --> 52:26.816
Sitting in your car?

52:26.849 --> 52:28.918
A bunch of boys
on the computer?

52:35.124 --> 52:37.560
No, no, no. Thank you.

52:37.593 --> 52:40.596
So, I see they sprung you
from detention, huh?

52:40.630 --> 52:42.065
Yeah, apparently,
small-town hospitality

52:42.098 --> 52:44.268
doesn't apply to Wi-Fi.

52:44.301 --> 52:45.935
They're not too keen
on strangers staking out

52:45.969 --> 52:47.937
a school parking lot...
you know, kids and all.

52:47.971 --> 52:49.739
Yeah, in hindsight,
that makes complete sense.

52:49.772 --> 52:50.974
Mm-hmm.

52:51.007 --> 52:52.976
Guys, could I talk to you
for a sec?

52:53.009 --> 52:54.110
- Yeah.
- My office.

52:54.143 --> 52:56.079
Come on in. Have a seat.

52:56.112 --> 52:57.981
You can leave the door open.

52:58.014 --> 52:59.782
Here's the deal.

52:59.816 --> 53:02.118
Our opponents are pumping
way more into this

53:02.151 --> 53:04.053
than I ever expected them to.

53:04.087 --> 53:07.056
- Huh.
- This rinky-dink stuff is not gonna fly.

53:07.090 --> 53:09.125
We need to up
our fundraising game.

53:09.158 --> 53:11.060
Okay. That's...

53:11.094 --> 53:13.930
Sure. Do you want to do, uh,
like, a street fair or...?

53:13.963 --> 53:15.932
That's a good idea.

53:15.965 --> 53:17.600
No, it's not a good idea.

53:17.633 --> 53:19.736
Don't... No, we're not
gonna do that.

53:19.769 --> 53:21.771
Have you ever been to New York?

53:25.174 --> 53:27.577
Oh, my God, please unplug it.

53:27.610 --> 53:29.012
Please unplug it.

53:30.613 --> 53:32.615
Unplug it!

53:34.117 --> 53:36.719
I'm just looking
at the guest list here.

53:36.753 --> 53:38.955
Great. Great turnout.

53:38.988 --> 53:41.758
Especially considering
the short notice.

53:41.791 --> 53:43.126
Really good.

53:44.761 --> 53:47.630
Mmm. You ever have
one of those?

53:49.766 --> 53:51.734
Yeah, green beans.

53:51.768 --> 53:53.036
Haricot vert.

53:54.637 --> 53:57.707
Isn't that French
for "green beans"?

53:57.740 --> 54:00.043
These are more delicate.

54:00.076 --> 54:01.878
Thinner, more flavorful.

54:04.914 --> 54:07.717
- I didn't know you spoke French.
- Mm.

54:10.387 --> 54:11.954
Would you like something?

54:11.988 --> 54:14.090
No, no.

54:17.227 --> 54:19.562
This too loud?

54:49.992 --> 54:51.661
Richard and Ginnie Peeler

54:51.694 --> 54:52.662
are hosting.

54:52.695 --> 54:53.996
He's a hedge fund swell.

54:54.030 --> 54:56.199
She's been saving the Hudson
for about 25 years.

54:56.233 --> 54:58.067
Richard Peeler. Yeah?

54:58.101 --> 54:59.869
Got it.

55:01.904 --> 55:03.906
Are you, like, 12?

55:07.143 --> 55:09.213
It's not only that
the sand traps are deeper,

55:09.246 --> 55:11.681
but the quality
of the sand at...

55:11.714 --> 55:13.082
Excuse me. Gary! Hey.

55:13.116 --> 55:15.118
Dick Peeler.

55:15.151 --> 55:17.820
Gary, thank you for coming.

55:17.854 --> 55:19.889
Oh, my pleasure.
Thanks for having us.

55:19.922 --> 55:21.190
Well, we're
really, really excited.

55:21.225 --> 55:23.659
We're excited. Jack! Jack!

55:23.693 --> 55:25.094
I'd like you to meet
Richard Peeler.

55:25.128 --> 55:26.195
- What an honor.
- Colonel Jack Hastings.

55:26.230 --> 55:27.997
- Oh.
- Very nice to meet you.

55:28.030 --> 55:29.999
- Thank you for... having us.
- Oh, it's really an honor.

55:30.032 --> 55:32.034
- And, uh...
- Yeah.

55:32.068 --> 55:34.837
No, it's, uh, you know,
the authentic thing here.

55:34.871 --> 55:36.206
I see that. It's amazing.

55:36.240 --> 55:38.107
Uh, can I get you
something to drink?

55:38.141 --> 55:39.842
Sure. What would you like?

55:39.876 --> 55:42.912
Uh, I'd like a little, uh, tea.

55:42.945 --> 55:44.914
Chamomile if you have it.

55:44.947 --> 55:46.149
All right.

55:46.182 --> 55:47.750
That's fine.
You want a Scotch.

55:47.783 --> 55:49.051
- Yes, please.
- Yes, I know that.

55:56.893 --> 55:58.728
He's a criminal.

55:58.761 --> 55:59.962
Oh, thank you.

55:59.996 --> 56:01.164
He's a criminal.

56:01.197 --> 56:02.798
Trust me,
I've done deals with him.

56:02.832 --> 56:04.268
Our democracy is falling apart.

56:04.301 --> 56:05.768
We're gonna lose it.

56:05.801 --> 56:07.271
Tom Friedman had a great line.

56:07.304 --> 56:09.705
I like to say he's
the Bitcoin of presidents.

56:09.739 --> 56:11.475
Her whole dress line
was made in China.

56:11.508 --> 56:13.243
The man is mentally ill.

56:13.277 --> 56:14.877
Fuckface von Clownstick.

56:14.911 --> 56:16.712
I'm mad? We should all be mad.

56:16.746 --> 56:19.048
I mean, what kind
of person hunts elephants?

56:19.081 --> 56:21.318
And there's not a whole lot
of the, um...

56:21.351 --> 56:22.919
What did you call that?

56:22.952 --> 56:24.921
- Uh, farm-to-table.
- The farm-to-table.

56:24.954 --> 56:29.158
I mean, I guess
it all kind of, uh...

56:29.192 --> 56:33.963
all goes from farms to tables
of some kind.

56:37.234 --> 56:39.902
We're so excited
that you're all here.

56:39.936 --> 56:42.104
And we are so thankful

56:42.138 --> 56:44.208
to our old friend
for presenting us

56:44.241 --> 56:47.877
with another informative and,
uh, just stimulating evening.

56:47.910 --> 56:50.012
Oh.

56:50.046 --> 56:51.948
You know him. You love him.

56:51.981 --> 56:53.749
And sometimes hate.

56:53.783 --> 56:56.852
- Hate writing the checks, but, uh, you know.
- Yeah.

56:58.087 --> 57:00.224
- Gary.
- Thank you. Thanks so much.

57:00.257 --> 57:01.891
Thanks for coming.

57:01.924 --> 57:03.092
And thank you...

57:03.125 --> 57:05.229
Keep that going
for the Peelers, please.

57:05.262 --> 57:07.964
Their tremendous hospitality.

57:07.997 --> 57:10.234
Listen, I'm not gonna take up
too much of your time

57:10.267 --> 57:13.069
other than to say
thank you all for being here.

57:13.102 --> 57:16.105
One thing I do want to say,
though, is that

57:16.138 --> 57:20.009
Colonel Jack Hastings
is the embodiment

57:20.042 --> 57:22.178
of America's real greatness.

57:22.212 --> 57:26.182
Service to nation,
hard work, faith.

57:26.216 --> 57:29.286
Republicans don't own
those values, do they?

57:29.319 --> 57:31.020
They don't own 'em.

57:31.053 --> 57:32.989
They can't.

57:33.022 --> 57:34.291
Inclusion.

57:34.324 --> 57:35.992
That's the most important
of all.

57:36.025 --> 57:37.994
But sometimes,
we get comfortable

57:38.027 --> 57:39.862
in our own little
ideological bubbles.

57:39.895 --> 57:41.265
I see them.

57:41.298 --> 57:43.165
You can't see them,
necessarily, but I see 'em.

57:43.199 --> 57:44.568
There's a little bubble there.

57:44.601 --> 57:46.403
There's a little bubble there.

57:46.436 --> 57:48.871
And we forget to reach out.

57:48.904 --> 57:51.341
To find empathy
and understanding

57:51.375 --> 57:55.144
across religious or racial

57:55.177 --> 57:58.014
or just plain geographical
boundaries.

57:58.047 --> 58:00.983
And I hope tonight changes
that, even just a little bit.

58:02.018 --> 58:04.221
So, without further ado,

58:04.254 --> 58:06.856
I would like you to join me
in welcoming

58:06.889 --> 58:10.394
the next mayor of
Deerlaken, Wisconsin,

58:10.427 --> 58:12.928
Colonel Jack Hastings.

58:12.962 --> 58:14.997
Hear, hear.

58:19.436 --> 58:22.372
Uh, uh... thanks, folks.

58:22.406 --> 58:25.609
And thanks to Gary

58:25.642 --> 58:28.445
- and to the Peelers.
- Thank you.

58:28.478 --> 58:31.180
Wow, this is a great house.

58:31.214 --> 58:33.149
It's a great house.

58:33.182 --> 58:35.285
Um...

58:37.153 --> 58:39.922
I see some of you are...

58:39.955 --> 58:42.359
wondering what I'm doing here.

58:43.360 --> 58:44.894
And...

58:46.095 --> 58:48.799
I think I'm wondering the same.

58:50.032 --> 58:51.435
Uh...

58:51.468 --> 58:53.836
I guess that's the point.

58:55.238 --> 58:58.874
Without all this,
you might never have met me.

58:58.908 --> 59:02.245
And I certainly
wouldn't have met you.

59:03.480 --> 59:05.114
But...

59:06.516 --> 59:08.851
...uh, now we have.

59:11.688 --> 59:14.224
So, uh...

59:17.059 --> 59:18.228
Um...

59:18.261 --> 59:20.096
Colonel, Colonel.

59:20.129 --> 59:22.432
- Yeah.
- Gary Zimmer from "The D.C. Bugle."

59:22.466 --> 59:25.034
Um, why...

59:25.067 --> 59:29.071
why should a bunch of uptight
Upper West Siders care about

59:29.105 --> 59:30.906
a little town in Wisconsin?

59:32.709 --> 59:35.212
Uh, it's hard to say.

59:36.279 --> 59:38.382
I guess we're hurting,

59:38.415 --> 59:41.418
looking for help from you.

59:43.720 --> 59:45.389
What can we do to help?

59:45.422 --> 59:47.524
I'll take that. Money.

59:47.557 --> 59:49.459
Money.

59:49.493 --> 59:52.396
It's a serious question,
actually.

59:52.429 --> 59:55.298
You know,
our politics seem broken.

59:55.332 --> 59:59.902
Colonel, what do you see is
the system's greatest weakness?

01:00:03.005 --> 01:00:06.510
Hmm, well, I guess,
for one thing,

01:00:06.543 --> 01:00:09.111
this.

01:00:09.145 --> 01:00:10.913
Here, tonight.

01:00:12.382 --> 01:00:15.419
And I mean no disrespect.

01:00:16.753 --> 01:00:20.089
I just think
this seems a bit crazy.

01:00:20.122 --> 01:00:22.191
I want to help my town.

01:00:22.225 --> 01:00:24.160
I want to be mayor,

01:00:24.193 --> 01:00:27.297
some town in the middle
of Wisconsin.

01:00:27.330 --> 01:00:29.266
So, instead of being home

01:00:29.299 --> 01:00:32.302
working on some smart things
to help my town,

01:00:32.335 --> 01:00:35.205
I have to fly here to your town

01:00:35.238 --> 01:00:38.174
and convince you
that my town's worth saving.

01:00:38.208 --> 01:00:41.043
And that I'm worth it.

01:00:41.076 --> 01:00:44.514
And that saving it
is worth it to you.

01:00:44.548 --> 01:00:47.016
All so you can give me
some money.

01:00:47.049 --> 01:00:50.019
Not for my town, but for me.

01:00:50.052 --> 01:00:54.458
To help convince my town
that I'm worth it.

01:00:56.359 --> 01:00:59.529
I mean...

01:00:59.563 --> 01:01:04.166
I don't know,
it just sounds so stupid.

01:01:19.249 --> 01:01:21.016
Still crying?

01:01:22.452 --> 01:01:24.621
A little bit.

01:01:24.654 --> 01:01:26.289
Mm.

01:01:27.824 --> 01:01:32.496
You gonna do that
all the way home?

01:01:32.529 --> 01:01:34.331
Yes.

01:01:37.367 --> 01:01:39.369
Why?

01:01:40.537 --> 01:01:42.506
Because the seat belt sign
is on

01:01:42.539 --> 01:01:45.475
and I can't get up to hug you.

01:01:45.509 --> 01:01:48.411
Damn, Jack.

01:01:48.445 --> 01:01:51.113
You walked in there,

01:01:51.146 --> 01:01:54.183
into the lion's den
like that...

01:01:54.217 --> 01:01:55.252
Daniel.

01:01:55.285 --> 01:01:57.119
Yeah, and just...

01:01:57.152 --> 01:02:00.257
you told 'em, straight up,
this isn't right.

01:02:00.290 --> 01:02:02.392
This is wrong.
The system is corrupt.

01:02:02.425 --> 01:02:04.594
I'm out
of order? You're out of order.

01:02:04.628 --> 01:02:06.296
The whole damn system's
out of order!

01:02:06.329 --> 01:02:08.632
Attica! Att...

01:02:10.267 --> 01:02:12.269
Money.

01:02:12.302 --> 01:02:16.540
Oh, God, their money
is the problem?

01:02:16.573 --> 01:02:19.242
Oh!

01:02:19.276 --> 01:02:20.844
You should've seen their faces.

01:02:20.877 --> 01:02:22.445
I saw.

01:02:22.479 --> 01:02:26.216
They ate it up.

01:02:26.249 --> 01:02:28.552
We could've named our price.

01:02:31.321 --> 01:02:33.088
Oh, no way Faith matches.

01:02:33.122 --> 01:02:35.325
- And why is that, now?
- Oh.

01:02:35.358 --> 01:02:38.428
Because they're spending
to stop something,

01:02:38.461 --> 01:02:40.497
and we're spending
to start something.

01:02:41.631 --> 01:02:43.500
Hmm.

01:02:43.533 --> 01:02:45.435
I'm mad as hell,

01:02:45.468 --> 01:02:47.871
and I can't take it anymore!

01:02:47.904 --> 01:02:50.340
Oh!

01:02:50.373 --> 01:02:52.542
Gary, you... green bean?

01:02:52.576 --> 01:02:54.244
No.

01:02:54.277 --> 01:02:56.178
Okay. No, thank you.

01:02:58.248 --> 01:03:00.283
Wow.

01:03:00.317 --> 01:03:02.719
I'm telling you,
he is the real deal.

01:03:02.752 --> 01:03:05.589
It is like a Bill Clinton
with impulse control.

01:03:05.622 --> 01:03:07.624
Like a churchgoing
Bernie Sanders

01:03:07.657 --> 01:03:09.426
with better bone density.

01:03:09.459 --> 01:03:11.193
- He... Oh, here they are.
- Hello. Good morning.

01:03:11.227 --> 01:03:12.596
Here they are.

01:03:12.629 --> 01:03:14.598
Ladies and gentlemen,
the next mayor of Deerlaken

01:03:14.631 --> 01:03:16.198
and his talented
first daughter.

01:03:16.232 --> 01:03:18.234
- Please join me.
- You are fired up, huh?

01:03:18.268 --> 01:03:20.403
I am fired...
Why wouldn't I be fired up?

01:03:20.437 --> 01:03:24.608
I am working with the future
of the Democratic Party here.

01:03:24.641 --> 01:03:27.711
Oh, your dad the other night
was transcendent.

01:03:27.744 --> 01:03:29.546
He crushed it.

01:03:29.579 --> 01:03:31.715
And because of that,
I'd like to show you

01:03:31.748 --> 01:03:34.250
the fruits of your labor.

01:03:34.284 --> 01:03:38.221
Because he was so good,
I was able to hire...

01:03:38.254 --> 01:03:39.689
the "A" team.

01:03:39.723 --> 01:03:41.625
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm just kidding.

01:03:41.658 --> 01:03:43.293
They're not the "A" team.

01:03:43.326 --> 01:03:44.661
Not that you aren't great.

01:03:44.694 --> 01:03:47.464
But this...

01:03:47.497 --> 01:03:48.732
is the real "A" team.

01:03:48.765 --> 01:03:50.634
I get it,
but what are the numbers?

01:03:56.272 --> 01:03:57.507
- You know Kurt Lehman, polling and modeling.
- Oh, my God.

01:03:57.540 --> 01:03:59.174
- Yes. Hi.
- Hi.

01:03:59.209 --> 01:04:00.677
- He gives us a window into the electorate.
- Hi. - Hey.

01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:02.445
- How are you?
- Best in the business.

01:04:02.479 --> 01:04:04.214
When everyone was
predicting Hillary

01:04:04.247 --> 01:04:06.950
in a landslide over Trump,
Kurt was the one guy

01:04:06.983 --> 01:04:09.753
who had her
just barely beating him.

01:04:09.786 --> 01:04:13.256
My models just picked up the
trend lines, so...

01:04:13.289 --> 01:04:15.258
If the election had taken place
a month or two later...

01:04:15.291 --> 01:04:17.961
My numbers would've been
100% on the money.

01:04:17.994 --> 01:04:19.729
- Mm-hmm.
- Wow.

01:04:19.763 --> 01:04:21.398
Impressive.

01:04:21.431 --> 01:04:22.565
Well...

01:04:22.599 --> 01:04:24.334
Well, he was the least wrong.

01:04:24.367 --> 01:04:25.969
Tina Kuryev, analytics.

01:04:26.002 --> 01:04:27.604
She gives us a window
into the voters.

01:04:27.637 --> 01:04:29.239
Good to meet you, sir.

01:04:29.272 --> 01:04:31.741
Oh. I thought, uh,
polling did that.

01:04:31.775 --> 01:04:34.477
- It does.
- Well, he tells you how he thinks they feel.

01:04:34.511 --> 01:04:36.413
I tell you how
they really feel.

01:04:38.415 --> 01:04:41.284
- People are liars.
- Here we go.

01:04:41.317 --> 01:04:44.387
He can tell you how often
people say they go to church.

01:04:44.421 --> 01:04:45.789
She can tell you
if they actually go.

01:04:45.822 --> 01:04:47.991
I can tell you
if God is in their hearts.

01:04:48.024 --> 01:04:49.492
- Oh, my God.
- Tina's in online analytics.

01:04:49.526 --> 01:04:50.994
Hey, can I just say...

01:04:51.027 --> 01:04:53.496
we take deception into account,
too, okay?

01:04:53.530 --> 01:04:55.565
Yeah, polling is
an art form, but,

01:04:55.598 --> 01:04:57.834
you know, there's plenty
of science to back it up.

01:04:57.867 --> 01:05:00.336
Says the guy
still calling landlines.

01:05:00.370 --> 01:05:02.672
People tell computers
the truth, right?

01:05:02.706 --> 01:05:04.774
Their desires,
their prejudices.

01:05:04.808 --> 01:05:06.710
Every search,
every transaction...

01:05:06.743 --> 01:05:08.712
it's an unguarded
private moment.

01:05:08.745 --> 01:05:12.015
So there's no, uh,
margin of error, you know?

01:05:12.048 --> 01:05:14.784
The digital footprint
is your true self.

01:05:14.818 --> 01:05:17.020
But, surely,
people are more complicated

01:05:17.053 --> 01:05:19.322
than their online transactions.

01:05:19.355 --> 01:05:21.357
Well, says the woman
with three cats

01:05:21.391 --> 01:05:23.760
and an intense search history
of the herpes virus.

01:05:29.899 --> 01:05:31.835
One of the cats...

01:05:31.868 --> 01:05:33.737
Is this legal?

01:05:33.770 --> 01:05:36.539
Law enforcement
or in the eyes of God?

01:05:39.409 --> 01:05:41.845
<i>With two weeks to go
until election day,</i>

01:05:41.878 --> 01:05:44.347
<i>we have an update
on the Deerlaken mayoral race.</i>

01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:46.349
The race between
Colonel Jack Hastings

01:05:46.382 --> 01:05:49.652
<i>and incumbent Mayor Billy Braun
is tightening.</i>

01:05:49.686 --> 01:05:51.588
Who here has been chosen
as 527s?

01:05:51.621 --> 01:05:52.622
Raise your hands, please.

01:05:52.655 --> 01:05:55.625
One, two, three, four. Good.

01:05:55.658 --> 01:05:57.627
You all run super PACs now.

01:05:57.660 --> 01:06:01.798
You are no longer associated
with this campaign.

01:06:01.831 --> 01:06:06.669
And as such, it is time to move
to your super PAC location,

01:06:06.703 --> 01:06:09.839
which is all the way
at the back of the room,

01:06:09.873 --> 01:06:13.843
far, far away from the activity
of the campaign.

01:06:14.911 --> 01:06:16.579
Right now?

01:06:16.613 --> 01:06:19.382
I am not at liberty to say.

01:06:19.415 --> 01:06:22.752
The campaign cannot coordinate
with the super PAC.

01:06:22.786 --> 01:06:24.387
So...

01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:26.523

01:06:38.668 --> 01:06:41.404

They're all gonna get pamphlets

01:06:42.605 --> 01:06:44.374

- 29?

01:06:54.417 --> 01:06:55.952
That's middle-aged?

01:06:55.985 --> 01:06:58.121
Yes. Yes, it is.

- Did he just sigh?

Don't even get me started

01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:41.865

You want to come to Deerlaken,

you'll have to go through him.

01:09:00.643 --> 01:09:02.912

01:09:06.649 --> 01:09:07.984
- Thank you so much, sir.
- You're welcome.

01:09:08.017 --> 01:09:09.618
Thank you so much
for your support.

01:09:09.652 --> 01:09:11.520
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:09:13.756 --> 01:09:16.792
How the hell did she get the
bayou billionaires involved?

01:09:16.826 --> 01:09:18.261
You okay?
Do you need some help?

01:09:18.295 --> 01:09:19.996
- Just fine.
- You're good? Okay, thank you.

01:09:20.029 --> 01:09:21.764
She must have promised
that they could have

01:09:21.798 --> 01:09:23.633
the town smelted
after the election.

01:09:28.671 --> 01:09:30.540
I'm just very impressed
with all this.

01:09:30.573 --> 01:09:32.841
- You... you do the polling.
- Uh-huh. In fact...

01:09:33.876 --> 01:09:35.645
There it is.

01:09:35.678 --> 01:09:36.712
What is that?

01:09:36.746 --> 01:09:38.613
No, who is that?
Elton Chambers.

01:09:38.648 --> 01:09:40.716
The Rocket Man?

01:09:40.750 --> 01:09:42.585
The billionaire
Rocket Man, yes.

01:09:42.618 --> 01:09:44.720
Jesus Chr...
I thought he was dead.

01:09:44.754 --> 01:09:46.656
- Well, he is dead.
- No, no, no.

01:09:46.689 --> 01:09:48.758
A series of micro-strokes.
It's all good.

01:10:07.010 --> 01:10:10.780
Sir Elton, thank you
so, so much for coming.

01:10:10.813 --> 01:10:13.850
Everyone, this is
the great Sir Elton.

01:10:15.352 --> 01:10:17.687
Let's get through
the pleasantries.

01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:20.556
This is Jack Hastings
and his daughter Diana.

01:10:20.590 --> 01:10:24.560
Hello to you.

01:10:24.594 --> 01:10:26.896
All right, well,
let's get right to it, then.

01:10:26.929 --> 01:10:32.068
Tell me, what is your position

01:10:32.101 --> 01:10:35.671
concerning the settlement

01:10:35.705 --> 01:10:40.810
of Kevyat Sharim?

01:10:42.145 --> 01:10:44.147
Uh...

01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:45.882
I'm not sure I...

01:10:45.915 --> 01:10:46.983
Israel.

01:10:47.016 --> 01:10:50.053
Jack believes
that sovereign nations

01:10:50.086 --> 01:10:51.754
are entitled to self-defense.

01:10:51.788 --> 01:10:52.922
Strongly?

01:10:52.955 --> 01:10:54.157
Strongly believes, yes.

01:11:01.197 --> 01:11:02.999
An election is a moral horror,

01:11:03.032 --> 01:11:05.668
as bad as a battle
but without the blood.

01:11:05.701 --> 01:11:07.904
That's George Bernard Shaw.

01:11:09.406 --> 01:11:10.907
Get the car.

01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:12.108
I think that went well.

01:11:12.141 --> 01:11:13.910
Seemed like a really nice guy.

01:11:13.943 --> 01:11:15.678
Actually looked
pretty good, right?

01:11:15.711 --> 01:11:16.879
- Yeah.
- Surprisingly robust.

01:11:16.913 --> 01:11:18.915
Elton Chambers is in.

01:11:18.948 --> 01:11:21.050
- Oh.
- Ah. All right.

01:11:21.084 --> 01:11:22.718
Making it rain.

01:11:22.752 --> 01:11:25.588
He actually has a machine
that makes it rain.

01:11:35.665 --> 01:11:38.634
This margin of error
is really shrinking.

01:11:38.668 --> 01:11:39.769
Excuse me. Gary...

01:11:39.802 --> 01:11:40.903
- Mr. Zimmer.
- Mm-mm.

01:11:40.937 --> 01:11:43.240
- Becca, super PAC.
- Uh...

01:11:43.273 --> 01:11:45.708
Okay.

01:11:45.741 --> 01:11:47.643
- Uh, big guy?
- Hmm?

01:11:47.677 --> 01:11:49.712
We got a problem.

01:12:00.089 --> 01:12:02.024
Hey, everybody.

01:12:02.058 --> 01:12:03.993
Hard at work, I see.
That's good.

01:12:04.026 --> 01:12:06.195
That's good.
I had a couple of questions.

01:12:06.230 --> 01:12:07.997
The first is: What the fuck?!

01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:10.133
What tactical genius in here

01:12:10.166 --> 01:12:12.436
thought it might be a good idea
to carpet-bomb

01:12:12.469 --> 01:12:15.205
a particular neighborhood
in this town

01:12:15.239 --> 01:12:19.008
with flyers suggesting
that Colonel Jack Hastings

01:12:19.041 --> 01:12:20.776
- would make sure...
- Fuck.

01:12:20.810 --> 01:12:24.180
- ...that contraception
is paid for by the government?

01:12:27.984 --> 01:12:29.719
Uh, I did.

01:12:29.752 --> 01:12:31.954
- Oh.
- The data showed an

01:12:31.988 --> 01:12:34.023
unusually concentrated grouping
of single women in the area

01:12:34.056 --> 01:12:36.092
who are deeply interested
in reproductive rights.

01:12:36.125 --> 01:12:37.261
And you know why that is?

01:12:37.294 --> 01:12:38.895
Well, "why" is not really...

01:12:38.928 --> 01:12:40.830
Because this "concentrated
grouping of single women,"

01:12:40.863 --> 01:12:42.865
as you put it, is a convent.

01:12:43.933 --> 01:12:45.768
They are nuns.

01:12:45.801 --> 01:12:48.838
Which is how many of them are
going to end up voting for us.

01:12:48.871 --> 01:12:51.107
"Nuns" of them. Zero.

01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:53.243
It's not funny.

01:12:53.277 --> 01:12:55.678
I'm not laughing.

01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:00.016
Fuck.

01:13:00.049 --> 01:13:02.852
Well, I think we can
appreciate the humor

01:13:02.885 --> 01:13:05.154
in this very honest mistake.

01:13:05.188 --> 01:13:07.056
And the fact that the nuns

01:13:07.089 --> 01:13:08.724
are generously turning
the other cheek

01:13:08.758 --> 01:13:09.926
makes it a nonstory, but...

01:13:09.959 --> 01:13:11.261
Brooke, Brooke, if I may.

01:13:11.295 --> 01:13:13.297
Uh, this is really just
another perfect example

01:13:13.330 --> 01:13:16.732
of the D.C. elite coming into
a place they don't understand

01:13:16.766 --> 01:13:18.202
and trying to dictate
how we should live.

01:13:18.235 --> 01:13:20.803
The Democrat Party can't win.
They're getting desperate.

01:13:20.836 --> 01:13:22.872
They don't know us,
they don't want to know us,

01:13:22.905 --> 01:13:24.907
- and they look down on our values.
- No, no.

01:13:24.941 --> 01:13:26.809
That's "we." You're D.C. elite.

01:13:26.842 --> 01:13:28.212
Oh, no, actually,
I'm from here.

01:13:28.245 --> 01:13:29.879
Faith, I didn't know that.

01:13:29.912 --> 01:13:31.948
- You're from Wisconsin?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

01:13:31.981 --> 01:13:33.816
Well, no, "Deer-lake-en."
I'm from "Deer-lake-en."

01:13:33.849 --> 01:13:35.319
- What? Whoa.
- Oh. Wow.

01:13:35.352 --> 01:13:37.753
So this campaign has been
a bit of a homecoming.

01:13:37.787 --> 01:13:39.223
- It really is, Brooke. Thank you.
- No, no.

01:13:39.256 --> 01:13:41.157
No, no, that's a lie.
That's a lie.

01:13:41.190 --> 01:13:42.825
- No, it's...
- You're lying.

01:13:42.858 --> 01:13:43.926
- It's-it's the truth.
- She's ly... That's...

01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:45.529
- I'm from here.
- No, that... What are you even doing?

01:13:45.562 --> 01:13:46.563
- Okay.
- I-I am from here.

01:13:46.597 --> 01:13:47.564
- You're not from here!
- Well, as always, a great

01:13:47.598 --> 01:13:48.731
- and spirited discussion.
- Thank you so much.

01:13:48.764 --> 01:13:51.133
- No, hey! No, no, no, no. She's lying.
- Thank you both.

01:13:51.167 --> 01:13:52.269
- Unfortunately, we have to leave it there.
- She' a li...

01:13:52.302 --> 01:13:55.104
Coming up, we'll look at more
of this year's hot races

01:13:55.137 --> 01:13:57.974
and how those will affect races
four years from now.

01:13:58.007 --> 01:14:00.042
Why do you even lie
about something like that?

01:14:00.076 --> 01:14:03.347
Honestly, I, uh...
I don't even know.

01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:05.181
"I... I don't even know."

01:14:05.215 --> 01:14:07.049
Wh-What do you mean,
you don't know?

01:14:07.083 --> 01:14:10.119
You can't just lie
about something like that.

01:14:10.152 --> 01:14:12.256
You just walk away?

01:14:12.289 --> 01:14:15.891
You just told America that
you're from "Deer-lake-en"?

01:14:15.925 --> 01:14:18.362
That's not even
how you pronounce it!

01:14:18.395 --> 01:14:21.831
"Deer-lake-en," my ass.

01:14:21.864 --> 01:14:23.933
Oh, my God.

01:14:23.966 --> 01:14:26.336
She's a fucking genius!

01:14:26.370 --> 01:14:28.170
Oh!

01:14:28.205 --> 01:14:30.374
Oh, my God, I hate her so much.

01:14:30.407 --> 01:14:32.108
I hate her. I hate her.

01:14:32.141 --> 01:14:34.877
She said it,
and now it's the truth.

01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:37.880
Fuck me.

01:14:39.249 --> 01:14:40.883
Another round, guys?

01:14:40.916 --> 01:14:42.219
Okay.

01:14:44.053 --> 01:14:46.256
Goddamn it.
You're killing me.

01:14:46.290 --> 01:14:47.890
That's good. Yeah.

01:14:50.159 --> 01:14:51.861
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

01:14:51.894 --> 01:14:52.995
Hey, Mikes!

01:14:53.029 --> 01:14:55.064
How you doing, guys?

01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.236
Hello, everybody.

01:14:59.269 --> 01:15:01.305
- Hey, big guy.
- Hey, Gary. Um...

01:15:01.338 --> 01:15:03.906
- Burger and a Bud.
- Oh, thank you very much.

01:15:03.939 --> 01:15:05.908
You know, that looks great.
Uh, can I have one of those?

01:15:05.941 --> 01:15:07.176
No.

01:15:07.210 --> 01:15:09.313
What you guys doing?
Looking at some ads?

01:15:09.346 --> 01:15:11.147
Yeah, they're just
taking me through it.

01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:13.082
Bio. Very nice.

01:15:13.115 --> 01:15:15.184
Education. That's important.

01:15:15.218 --> 01:15:17.853
Hey, are we sure that we want
to be doing this here

01:15:17.887 --> 01:15:19.922
and not in Faith's room
or the mayor's office?

01:15:19.955 --> 01:15:23.025
Because right now I'm not sure
that our opposition knows

01:15:23.059 --> 01:15:24.927
exactly what we're about to do.

01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:26.630
And that seems unfair.
No, no, no, no, no.

01:15:26.663 --> 01:15:28.197
Don't put 'em away
on my account.

01:15:28.231 --> 01:15:30.434
Why don't we got one of
those overhead projectors

01:15:30.467 --> 01:15:31.768
- that you have at a bowling alley?
- Stop.

01:15:31.802 --> 01:15:33.936
- Kurt, you don't have to leave.
- So everybody here can see it.

01:15:33.969 --> 01:15:34.970
Wouldn't that be good?

01:15:35.004 --> 01:15:36.172
Kurt, come on.

01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:39.141
Mmm!

01:15:39.175 --> 01:15:40.876
Why do you talk
to them like that?

01:15:40.910 --> 01:15:41.944
Like what?

01:15:41.977 --> 01:15:43.112
Like that.
Like they're idiots.

01:15:43.145 --> 01:15:44.980
Well...

01:15:46.082 --> 01:15:48.084
Listen.

01:15:49.353 --> 01:15:51.254
I saw some polls.

01:15:51.288 --> 01:15:53.022
If we don't
figure this out soon,

01:15:53.055 --> 01:15:54.458
there's no way
we're gonna beat her.

01:15:54.491 --> 01:15:57.227
- Our demographics are so...
- "Her"?

01:15:57.260 --> 01:16:00.230
- Who?
- Her.

01:16:00.263 --> 01:16:02.898
I mean, you said,
if we don't figure it out soon,

01:16:02.932 --> 01:16:04.401
we're not gonna be able
to beat her.

01:16:04.434 --> 01:16:06.370
We're not gonna beat
her candidate, Braun.

01:16:06.403 --> 01:16:08.037
Mayor Braun.

01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:10.240
Herr... Herr Braun.

01:16:10.273 --> 01:16:11.941
Herr, her. Same thing.

01:16:11.974 --> 01:16:13.210
Mm-hmm.

01:16:13.243 --> 01:16:15.978
Look, Gary, I don't, um,
really understand

01:16:16.011 --> 01:16:17.414
how you guys do things in D.C.,

01:16:17.447 --> 01:16:19.216
but if you're gonna work
for my father,

01:16:19.249 --> 01:16:20.517
you need to treat people
with respect.

01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:22.386
- With. With.
- What?

01:16:22.419 --> 01:16:24.254
Work with your father, not for.

01:16:24.287 --> 01:16:27.089
You said "for."
It's a semantic thing, but...

01:16:27.123 --> 01:16:30.025
it's... you know,
it's an important distinction.

01:16:34.096 --> 01:16:36.299
Just so you know,

01:16:36.333 --> 01:16:38.402
they don't actually serve
hamburgers and Budweiser here,

01:16:38.435 --> 01:16:40.404
'cause it's a hofbrau house,
so they would serve

01:16:40.437 --> 01:16:42.104
German food and German beers.

01:16:42.138 --> 01:16:43.440
They've been patronizing you.

01:16:49.746 --> 01:16:53.216
Just so you know, I don't even
like hamburgers or Budweiser,

01:16:53.250 --> 01:16:54.718
so I've been
patronizing them...

01:16:54.751 --> 01:16:56.286
- the whole time.
- Okay. Ah.

01:16:56.319 --> 01:16:57.521
Did a little switcheroo.

01:16:57.554 --> 01:17:00.424
Oh, and just so you know,
congratulations.

01:17:00.457 --> 01:17:02.925
Our campaign made the paper.

01:17:05.228 --> 01:17:06.396
Oh, God.

01:17:13.537 --> 01:17:15.572
She's so pretty.

01:17:15.605 --> 01:17:18.275
I bet she smells
like Pop-Tarts.

01:17:22.612 --> 01:17:25.181
Is he still looking?

01:17:25.215 --> 01:17:26.483
Now, Colonel Jack Hastings.

01:17:26.516 --> 01:17:28.251
- Mm-hmm. Absolutely.
- Military man.

01:17:28.285 --> 01:17:30.186
- From the heartland.
- Yep.

01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:31.488
No greater place in America.

01:17:31.521 --> 01:17:33.122
- No, no.
- Am I right?

01:17:33.155 --> 01:17:36.226
- Nope.
- He is now part of the loony left.

01:17:36.259 --> 01:17:39.094
No, not just the loony left.
He's not just a Democrat.

01:17:39.128 --> 01:17:40.597
- No.
- He has joined the...

01:17:40.630 --> 01:17:42.532
- Squad.
- Socialism. - Mm-hmm.

01:17:42.566 --> 01:17:44.201
Socialism. Hmm.

01:17:44.234 --> 01:17:46.269
Do you think
it hurts our military

01:17:46.303 --> 01:17:49.573
to have one of their own
throw in with the Democrats?

01:17:51.241 --> 01:17:54.344
I know that if I had served,

01:17:54.377 --> 01:17:56.413
I wouldn't like it.

01:17:56.446 --> 01:17:59.416
Mm. Yeah.

01:17:59.449 --> 01:18:03.152
Wow, that was a harsh segment.

01:18:03.185 --> 01:18:05.154
Cutting but fair.

01:18:05.187 --> 01:18:08.123
It's like I wrote it myself
last night and sent it to them

01:18:08.157 --> 01:18:11.026
and they read it verbatim
like a scene.

01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:13.128
Go to bed.

01:18:13.162 --> 01:18:14.297
<i>What is this?</i>

01:18:14.331 --> 01:18:15.365
<i>What am I looking at?</i>

01:18:15.398 --> 01:18:16.800
Those are the...

01:18:16.833 --> 01:18:18.568
Why are we being outspent
three-to-one?

01:18:18.602 --> 01:18:20.237
And how do white women
not realize

01:18:20.270 --> 01:18:21.505
they're backing
the wrong horse?

01:18:21.538 --> 01:18:23.072
These numbers
aren't solidified.

01:18:23.105 --> 01:18:24.508
Yeah, well, you got to
make it happen,

01:18:24.541 --> 01:18:27.544
or you got to find me
some more fucking Hispanics.

01:18:27.577 --> 01:18:29.513
Where are my
fucking Hispanics?!

01:18:29.546 --> 01:18:33.450
I need some more fucking Hispanics, Kurt!

01:18:40.524 --> 01:18:42.526
Hey, everybody.

01:18:42.559 --> 01:18:44.261
Listen.

01:18:44.294 --> 01:18:46.128
I am profoundly disappointed

01:18:46.161 --> 01:18:48.665
in the comments
that I just made.

01:18:48.698 --> 01:18:52.269
My words and/or actions

01:18:52.302 --> 01:18:55.539
do not represent
who I am as a person and...

01:18:55.572 --> 01:18:57.641
- Teachable moment.
- It is a teachable moment.

01:18:57.674 --> 01:19:01.110
It's something I think
we can all learn from.

01:19:01.143 --> 01:19:02.312
And in that way, I feel like

01:19:02.345 --> 01:19:03.480
I have given you a gift.

01:19:03.513 --> 01:19:05.849
- You have my heart.
- And from this moment on,

01:19:05.882 --> 01:19:07.417
I vow to make this office

01:19:07.450 --> 01:19:11.588
a color- and gender-neutral
work environment.

01:19:11.621 --> 01:19:13.857
That is my...

01:19:13.890 --> 01:19:16.259
Are you gonna get that?

01:19:16.293 --> 01:19:18.395
Ringing off the fucking hook.

01:19:18.428 --> 01:19:20.129
<i>A hundred percent.</i>

01:19:20.162 --> 01:19:21.431
<i>What do you mean, you're sure?</i>

01:19:21.464 --> 01:19:23.165
<i>I'm sure.</i>

01:19:23.198 --> 01:19:25.167
<i>You're sure,
or you're just pretty sure?</i>

01:19:25.201 --> 01:19:26.570
- 100% sure.
- Okay.

01:19:26.603 --> 01:19:30.139
Okay, Tina. Better not be
another nun situation.

01:19:30.172 --> 01:19:31.608
It's not.

01:19:31.641 --> 01:19:33.543
Hey. Is your dad here?

01:19:33.577 --> 01:19:35.211
Yeah. Dad!

01:19:35.245 --> 01:19:37.581
- Yeah?
- Come on in, Colonel.

01:19:41.284 --> 01:19:44.487
So, um, we can't win.

01:19:47.223 --> 01:19:51.461
The people in this town
are pretty set in their ways.

01:19:51.494 --> 01:19:53.330
And we lost the eight nuns.

01:19:53.363 --> 01:19:54.497
That wasn't good.

01:19:54.531 --> 01:19:57.601
So, we can't win.

01:19:59.269 --> 01:20:03.340
Uh... y-you know,
we appreciate all you done.

01:20:03.373 --> 01:20:06.476
I mean, the campaign and, uh...

01:20:06.509 --> 01:20:09.646
I'm just sorry
we let you down, but...

01:20:09.679 --> 01:20:13.350
well, all I can say
is thank you.

01:20:13.383 --> 01:20:15.619
Really, Gary,
thank you for everything.

01:20:15.652 --> 01:20:17.220
It was a hell of a ride.

01:20:17.253 --> 01:20:20.223
Are you shitting me?

01:20:20.256 --> 01:20:22.459
All I have to say is
we can't win,

01:20:22.492 --> 01:20:24.661
and you're-you're through,
you're out.

01:20:24.694 --> 01:20:26.529
- You said we can't win.
- Unless.

01:20:26.563 --> 01:20:28.632
We can't win unless...

01:20:28.665 --> 01:20:30.367
You didn't let me finish.

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:33.937
We can't win unless
it turns out that this town

01:20:33.970 --> 01:20:36.539
isn't the Mayberry
everybody thinks it is.

01:20:36.573 --> 01:20:38.375
I just got a little piece
of intel

01:20:38.408 --> 01:20:39.776
that's kind of intriguing.

01:20:39.809 --> 01:20:44.414
So, the mayor's brother Ziggy,
he had an Oxy problem.

01:20:44.447 --> 01:20:47.550
Well, he was a roofer
and got hurt on the job.

01:20:47.584 --> 01:20:49.386
Yes, well,
what you might not know

01:20:49.419 --> 01:20:52.489
is that the mayor
pulled some strings,

01:20:52.522 --> 01:20:55.458
kept him out of jail,
got him into rehab.

01:20:55.492 --> 01:20:57.327
That is abuse of power,
nepotism.

01:20:57.360 --> 01:20:59.596
- Probably some clerical shit in there.
- Come on.

01:20:59.629 --> 01:21:01.364
Gary.

01:21:01.398 --> 01:21:03.233
But we're the good guys, right?

01:21:03.266 --> 01:21:05.435
Yeah, we're the good guys.

01:21:05.468 --> 01:21:07.671
When they go low...

01:21:07.704 --> 01:21:09.506
We go high.

01:21:09.539 --> 01:21:12.275
Unless we also need to go low,
apparently.

01:21:12.308 --> 01:21:14.978
Only to keep those who
would go lower out of power.

01:21:15.011 --> 01:21:17.480
So, when they go low,
we go higher,

01:21:17.514 --> 01:21:19.582
incrementally, in relation
to how low they went.

01:21:19.616 --> 01:21:21.651
Regrettably, yes.

01:21:21.685 --> 01:21:24.254
When they go low,
we go almost as low,

01:21:24.287 --> 01:21:25.655
but we feel worse doing it.

01:21:25.689 --> 01:21:27.490
You think they thought twice
about making your dad

01:21:27.524 --> 01:21:29.726
look like a PTS nutcase?

01:21:29.759 --> 01:21:31.428
And I'm going low because

01:21:31.461 --> 01:21:33.263
I'm gonna tell the truth
about the mayor?

01:21:33.296 --> 01:21:35.298
His brother's fragile, Gary.

01:21:35.331 --> 01:21:36.566
This town is fragile.

01:21:36.599 --> 01:21:38.768
The whole area is fragile.
Our democracy.

01:21:38.802 --> 01:21:41.671
Stop.
We're not doing it.

01:21:41.705 --> 01:21:44.307
Okay?
People are gonna get hurt.

01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:45.842
I'm sorry... I really am...

01:21:45.875 --> 01:21:49.312
but sometimes good people
have to do shitty things

01:21:49.345 --> 01:21:51.481
in service of the greater good.

01:21:51.514 --> 01:21:53.349
Isn't that right, Colonel?

01:21:59.656 --> 01:22:01.624
Hey.

01:22:05.361 --> 01:22:06.463
Hey.

01:22:06.496 --> 01:22:08.331
Yeah?

01:22:08.364 --> 01:22:10.400
Gary, stop.

01:22:11.634 --> 01:22:13.603
What?

01:22:13.636 --> 01:22:16.272
Is this politics?

01:22:16.306 --> 01:22:18.475
It's not politics anymore,
Diana.

01:22:18.508 --> 01:22:20.477
It's... it's math.

01:22:20.510 --> 01:22:21.745
That's what an election is.

01:22:21.778 --> 01:22:23.346
It's just math.

01:22:23.379 --> 01:22:25.749
We need what they get plus one.

01:22:25.782 --> 01:22:27.617
That's all.

01:22:27.650 --> 01:22:29.552
And if I can't get that

01:22:29.586 --> 01:22:31.654
by getting more people
to vote for your dad,

01:22:31.688 --> 01:22:35.492
then I have to get fewer people
to vote for Braun.

01:23:00.884 --> 01:23:02.886
Hi.

01:23:04.487 --> 01:23:06.790
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

01:23:06.823 --> 01:23:08.625
I'm so sorry.

01:23:11.628 --> 01:23:14.664
I... I'm pulling the plug.

01:23:14.697 --> 01:23:17.333
- Hey, hey.
- I mean, we have the money we need.

01:23:17.367 --> 01:23:18.868
We have more than
we would need.

01:23:18.902 --> 01:23:21.871
And this would...
destroy your brother.

01:23:23.373 --> 01:23:26.509
- And I'm just so sorry.
- Hey.

01:23:27.744 --> 01:23:30.880
You have nothing
to be sorry for.

01:23:31.948 --> 01:23:34.784
You saved us, Diana.

01:23:34.818 --> 01:23:37.687
- Mm-hmm.
- This place was done.

01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:41.357
Just another town in the middle
of nowhere, going nowhere.

01:23:41.391 --> 01:23:45.495
And everyone agreed...
yours was the best idea we had.

01:23:45.528 --> 01:23:48.364
Unless you want to go back
to the two Mikes' idea of...

01:23:48.398 --> 01:23:50.600
ostrich meat farms.

01:23:51.835 --> 01:23:54.537
Diana, you moving back here,

01:23:54.571 --> 01:23:56.506
caring so much...

01:23:56.539 --> 01:23:58.842
I mean, this whole thing...

01:24:00.577 --> 01:24:04.848
Well, I just know
how proud of you your dad is

01:24:04.881 --> 01:24:07.383
and how proud
your mom would be.

01:24:09.419 --> 01:24:13.723
And how grateful
every single one of us are

01:24:13.756 --> 01:24:16.626
for what you've done
and everything you've given.

01:24:18.461 --> 01:24:20.463
It's working.

01:24:25.568 --> 01:24:27.570
Okay.

01:24:31.708 --> 01:24:33.843
What do we do about Gary?

01:24:34.878 --> 01:24:37.947
Whatever Gary thinks he's got,

01:24:37.981 --> 01:24:40.550
why don't we just give him
something better?

01:25:04.574 --> 01:25:05.875
Hmm.

01:25:05.909 --> 01:25:07.176
<i>No, forget the rehab thing.</i>

01:25:07.211 --> 01:25:09.946
<i>This is bigger. Obviously, you
can't use my name, so just...</i>

01:25:09.979 --> 01:25:12.216
"Senior official
with inside knowledge

01:25:12.249 --> 01:25:13.783
of campaign strategy."

01:25:13.816 --> 01:25:15.518
Yes, you are welcome.

01:25:15.551 --> 01:25:16.686
Tell me they're running it.

01:25:16.719 --> 01:25:18.054
- They are running it.
- Oh, yeah, baby!

01:25:18.087 --> 01:25:19.989
- Shit's gonna hit the fan.
- Oh, it feels good.

01:25:20.023 --> 01:25:21.991
Now, the word of the day
is "disappointed."

01:25:22.025 --> 01:25:24.661
We are not mad at the mayor.
We are not shocked.

01:25:24.694 --> 01:25:26.663
- We're just disappointed.
- Yeah, I am disappointed.

01:25:26.696 --> 01:25:28.598
- I'm disappointed, too.
- I mean, it's disappointing.

01:25:28.631 --> 01:25:30.700
- It is. You know what, he's the mayor.
- He betrayed us.

01:25:30.733 --> 01:25:32.468
He betrayed us,
and it's disappointing.

01:25:32.502 --> 01:25:33.870
- I'm hurt.
- But I'm not mad.

01:25:33.903 --> 01:25:35.939
- No, I'm just disappointed.
- Me, too.

01:25:35.972 --> 01:25:37.607
Tonight, we have this picture

01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:38.975
of the alleged
ten-year-old love child

01:25:39.008 --> 01:25:41.544
of the Wisconsin mayor
and the girl's mother.

01:25:41.577 --> 01:25:43.846
We've obscured the child's face
to protect her identity

01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:45.048
but left enough clues

01:25:45.081 --> 01:25:47.550
so that you can probably
figure it out.

01:25:47.583 --> 01:25:49.552
To discuss this
important, late-breaking story,

01:25:49.585 --> 01:25:51.487
we go to our panel
with a feature

01:25:51.521 --> 01:25:55.625
you'll only see here on CNN:
the Duodecabox.

01:25:55.658 --> 01:25:58.695
What do you think,
Phil, Diane, Liz, Carl,

01:25:58.728 --> 01:26:00.863
Barbara and... let's say Craig?

01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:12.709
Kaylee?

01:26:12.742 --> 01:26:13.977
- Kaylee.
- Y-Yeah.

01:26:14.010 --> 01:26:15.845
- Can you clean this up, please?
- Oh, sure.

01:26:15.878 --> 01:26:18.014
It was an accident
with the sandwich. Thank you.

01:26:42.105 --> 01:26:43.773
Hey, man.

01:26:43.806 --> 01:26:45.775
Can I talk to you
about white power?

01:26:48.945 --> 01:26:50.613
Yeah, guns save lives.

01:26:50.646 --> 01:26:51.914
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

01:27:00.890 --> 01:27:02.592
It has been
a hard-fought campaign,

01:27:02.625 --> 01:27:04.727
but now it's in the hands
of the voters.

01:27:04.761 --> 01:27:06.963
And excuse me... there's
the Colonel right there.

01:27:06.996 --> 01:27:08.164
Colonel, come on in.

01:27:08.197 --> 01:27:09.632
- Diana.
- Hi. - Hi. Good morning.

01:27:09.665 --> 01:27:10.700
Did you get some rest?

01:27:10.733 --> 01:27:12.035
Yeah, we got a little bit.

01:27:12.068 --> 01:27:13.770
- Excuse us, folks.
- Good morning. Good morning.

01:27:13.803 --> 01:27:15.905
Excuse us. Excuse us.

01:27:15.938 --> 01:27:17.341
There he is.

01:27:17.374 --> 01:27:18.875
- Billy. Hey.
- Colonel, good to see you, sir.

01:27:18.908 --> 01:27:20.610
- How are you? How are you?
- Good to see you.

01:27:20.643 --> 01:27:21.711
How about a picture?

01:27:21.744 --> 01:27:23.046
All righty.

01:27:23.079 --> 01:27:24.580
Come on. Come on.

01:27:24.614 --> 01:27:25.782
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Thank you.

01:27:25.815 --> 01:27:27.683
Oh, make sure you get
this guy's I.D.

01:27:27.717 --> 01:27:29.018
Okay.

01:27:29.052 --> 01:27:30.787
Billy, we're just talking
to Fox. Just Fox.

01:27:30.820 --> 01:27:33.589
- Hello. Good morning.
- Good morning, Jack.

01:27:33.623 --> 01:27:35.658
- Sign right there.
- Yeah. All right.

01:27:35.691 --> 01:27:36.993
Your dad is really something.

01:27:37.026 --> 01:27:38.661
- Yeah.
- He's done a great job.

01:27:38.694 --> 01:27:39.896
- Yeah, yeah.
- Go over here?

01:27:39.929 --> 01:27:41.664
So have you.
Thank you for everything.

01:27:41.697 --> 01:27:42.832
- It's been...
- My pleasure.

01:27:42.865 --> 01:27:44.100
- So...
- I was thinking, maybe later,

01:27:44.133 --> 01:27:46.035
if you want to watch
the returns come in?

01:27:46.069 --> 01:27:48.171
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'd love to.

01:27:49.806 --> 01:27:51.974
Oh. Oh, shoot.

01:27:52.008 --> 01:27:54.177
You know what? I have to
head back to the farm,

01:27:54.211 --> 01:27:55.845
- but I'll see you later, okay?
- Okay.

01:27:55.878 --> 01:27:57.680
Okay.

01:27:57.713 --> 01:27:59.782
Diana, aren't you gonna vote?

01:28:06.789 --> 01:28:08.124
Nothing?

01:28:08.157 --> 01:28:10.193
- No early returns?
- Nothing.

01:28:10.227 --> 01:28:12.695
- What about exit polling?
- No exit polling.

01:28:12.728 --> 01:28:14.030
Well, is there
another precinct?

01:28:14.063 --> 01:28:15.131
No.

01:28:15.164 --> 01:28:16.732
Well, where else can they vote?

01:28:16.766 --> 01:28:17.967
Well, they can't vote
anywhere else.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.403
Was it all early voting?

01:28:19.436 --> 01:28:21.205
No early voting, no.
Nothing.

01:28:21.238 --> 01:28:23.106
What do you mean,
nobody has voted yet?

01:28:23.139 --> 01:28:24.707
Uh, big guy.

01:28:24.740 --> 01:28:25.942
You're gonna want to see this.

01:28:25.975 --> 01:28:27.143
...smear Mayor Braun
with the falsehood

01:28:27.176 --> 01:28:28.778
of an illegitimate child.

01:28:28.811 --> 01:28:30.847
Which, as the report
you just read stated,

01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:32.949
is actually the man's
dear niece.

01:28:32.982 --> 01:28:35.118
Has the Hastings campaign
apologized?

01:28:35.151 --> 01:28:37.153
Uh, no, they haven't,
and it-it's too late for that.

01:28:37.186 --> 01:28:38.988
- Oh, fuck!
- Mayor Braun continues to

01:28:39.021 --> 01:28:40.723
focus on the issues.

01:28:40.756 --> 01:28:41.991
And quite frankly, Brooke,

01:28:42.024 --> 01:28:43.993
the media owes the mayor
an apology, as well,

01:28:44.026 --> 01:28:46.430
for credulously covering
a poorly sourced story.

01:28:46.463 --> 01:28:48.164
Faith! Congratulations.
Well done.

01:28:48.197 --> 01:28:50.166
- What the fuck are you doing?
- A new low.

01:28:50.199 --> 01:28:51.968
Oh, yeah, like I leaked
a cocked-up story

01:28:52.001 --> 01:28:53.736
about a bastard child
who happens to be

01:28:53.769 --> 01:28:55.004
the man's fucking niece.

01:28:55.037 --> 01:28:56.273
- Please, Gary.
- You fed me that bullshit.

01:28:56.306 --> 01:28:57.773
You know, go fuck yourself.

01:28:57.807 --> 01:28:59.041
- You go fuck yourself.
- You go fuck your...

01:28:59.075 --> 01:29:00.143
Okay, you two.

01:29:00.176 --> 01:29:02.011
Unfortunately, we're gonna
have to leave it there.

01:29:02.044 --> 01:29:03.679
Thank you so much, Brooke.

01:29:03.713 --> 01:29:04.847
- Thank you so much.
- Thanks, Brooke.

01:29:04.881 --> 01:29:05.915
- Thank you.
- We're clear.

01:29:05.948 --> 01:29:08.050
Why would I leak this? Huh?

01:29:08.084 --> 01:29:09.886
Oh, to just make me
take the bait.

01:29:09.919 --> 01:29:11.255
You didn't just want to win.

01:29:11.288 --> 01:29:13.156
You wanted to castrate me,
didn't you?

01:29:13.189 --> 01:29:14.891
If I wanted to cut
your dick off,

01:29:14.924 --> 01:29:16.293
I would have done it
in front of you

01:29:16.326 --> 01:29:19.162
just to see the last look
of horror in your eyes.

01:29:20.196 --> 01:29:21.864
You're telling the truth.

01:29:21.898 --> 01:29:23.300
No shit.

01:29:23.333 --> 01:29:25.168
What the fuck is going on here?

01:29:25.202 --> 01:29:26.769
Evan?

01:29:26.802 --> 01:29:28.004
What...

01:29:28.037 --> 01:29:29.105
Evan.

01:29:29.138 --> 01:29:30.039
Evan, oh, my God.

01:29:30.072 --> 01:29:31.774
- What's up, Becca?
- How the hell are you?

01:29:31.807 --> 01:29:33.142
- Hiya. Nice to see you.
- Good to see you.

01:29:33.176 --> 01:29:35.178
- How's everything?
- Yeah, I mean, it's going.

01:29:35.212 --> 01:29:37.214
What the hell?

01:29:37.247 --> 01:29:39.182
How the hell does he know her?

01:29:39.216 --> 01:29:40.917
Is he from here?

01:29:40.950 --> 01:29:43.953
Gary, look at his shoes.
I mean, really.

01:29:43.986 --> 01:29:45.988
And we have Alan to thank
for bringing this man

01:29:46.022 --> 01:29:47.257
- to our attention.
- It's Evan.

01:29:47.291 --> 01:29:48.891
Did I happen to mention that...

01:29:48.925 --> 01:29:51.093
Holy shit.

01:29:51.127 --> 01:29:53.497
- What? What?
- Come on!

01:29:53.530 --> 01:29:57.967
So, with 100%
of the vote counted,

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:01.305
the mayoral race is tied.

01:30:01.338 --> 01:30:03.739
One vote to one vote.

01:30:05.107 --> 01:30:06.343
No.

01:30:06.376 --> 01:30:08.911
Okay, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

01:30:08.945 --> 01:30:11.113
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:30:11.147 --> 01:30:13.015
Hold on. I, uh...

01:30:13.049 --> 01:30:15.252
I don't...
I don't know exactly

01:30:15.285 --> 01:30:18.255
what's going on here,
but it's weird.

01:30:18.288 --> 01:30:19.922
Could somebody please
explain to me

01:30:19.956 --> 01:30:21.525
- what's happening?
- Well, we had an election.

01:30:21.558 --> 01:30:23.893
- Yes, I know that.
- And we gave it our best.

01:30:23.926 --> 01:30:25.027
Just didn't work out.

01:30:25.061 --> 01:30:26.363
Didn't work out, Jack?
Come on.

01:30:26.396 --> 01:30:28.831
Do you know how much money
we invested in this?

01:30:28.864 --> 01:30:30.766
Yeah, if the news media
is to be believed,

01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:34.538
more than $45 million was
raised between the two of you.

01:30:42.845 --> 01:30:45.915
Oh, shit.

01:30:45.948 --> 01:30:47.917
Did you sucker me, Jack?

01:30:47.950 --> 01:30:49.986
I guess.

01:30:50.019 --> 01:30:51.988
You know what? Folks, sorry,

01:30:52.021 --> 01:30:53.257
but I'm getting
all that money back.

01:30:53.290 --> 01:30:54.291
From where?

01:30:54.324 --> 01:30:56.892
We put millions
into those PACs.

01:30:56.926 --> 01:30:58.828
Well, campaign finance law says

01:30:58.861 --> 01:31:00.997
that money needn't be
accounted for.

01:31:01.030 --> 01:31:03.099
Oh, my God.

01:31:03.132 --> 01:31:05.134
I got to give it to this place.

01:31:06.168 --> 01:31:08.170
Hey, Alan.

01:31:08.205 --> 01:31:09.339
Uh, it's Evan.

01:31:09.373 --> 01:31:10.840
Shit weasel.

01:31:10.873 --> 01:31:12.576
You're from this town,
aren't you?

01:31:12.609 --> 01:31:14.378
- Yeah.
- You set this whole thing up.

01:31:14.411 --> 01:31:16.112
You set me up, huh?

01:31:16.145 --> 01:31:18.981
You are so fired,
and you're going to jail!

01:31:19.015 --> 01:31:20.149
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:31:20.182 --> 01:31:21.951
It was me. I did it.

01:31:21.984 --> 01:31:23.253
You?

01:31:24.388 --> 01:31:26.055
Wh...

01:31:26.088 --> 01:31:27.291
Why?

01:31:27.324 --> 01:31:29.359
You know...

01:31:29.393 --> 01:31:32.329
it was just
this weird idea I had

01:31:32.362 --> 01:31:34.298
'cause the town needed money.

01:31:34.331 --> 01:31:36.866
So you...

01:31:36.899 --> 01:31:38.201
Uh, shot the video,

01:31:38.235 --> 01:31:41.305
and then had Evan
show it to you.

01:31:41.338 --> 01:31:42.372
Uh, I...

01:31:42.406 --> 01:31:45.174
We needed 750 grand
over three years

01:31:45.208 --> 01:31:47.076
to keep the school
from closing down.

01:31:47.109 --> 01:31:49.045
We blew way past that.

01:31:49.078 --> 01:31:51.315
We got enough to buy back
the base, redevelop it.

01:31:53.049 --> 01:31:56.386
And the speech,
the viral speech?

01:31:56.420 --> 01:31:58.154
<i>Can I get a motion to vote?</i>

01:31:58.187 --> 01:31:59.323
<i>Actually,
I'm here about that...</i>

01:31:59.356 --> 01:32:01.891
Fuck, what's the word?
Resolution.

01:32:01.924 --> 01:32:04.193
- I'll get it.
- Mike, do you want to help him and...

01:32:04.227 --> 01:32:05.462
Yeah.

01:32:05.495 --> 01:32:07.364
Just have it low enough.

01:32:07.397 --> 01:32:09.131
Just leave enough room
for that road sign in there.

01:32:09.165 --> 01:32:10.900
- Uh, am I supposed to have these on?
- No glasses.

01:32:10.933 --> 01:32:13.337
I'm lost.

01:32:13.370 --> 01:32:14.937
Okay, Dad, that's good,

01:32:14.970 --> 01:32:16.340
but you have to leave after.

01:32:16.373 --> 01:32:17.139
All right, one more time.

01:32:17.173 --> 01:32:19.975
I guess they weren't
principles.

01:32:21.244 --> 01:32:23.347
They're just hobbies.

01:32:30.420 --> 01:32:32.422
Holy shit, I think we got it.

01:32:32.456 --> 01:32:34.857
Oh, thank God.

01:32:46.936 --> 01:32:49.004
That was really just
baiting the hook.

01:32:49.038 --> 01:32:51.375
You guys took it from there.
I was never expecting her.

01:32:51.408 --> 01:32:53.377
Oh, I had a fucking blast.

01:32:55.044 --> 01:32:57.012
So you used me.

01:32:59.014 --> 01:33:00.484
We used you?

01:33:00.517 --> 01:33:03.453
You guys only show up here
once every four years,

01:33:03.487 --> 01:33:05.988
and only then
'cause it's a swing state.

01:33:06.021 --> 01:33:08.392
And then, when it's over,
you're gone.

01:33:08.425 --> 01:33:09.992
But we're still here

01:33:10.025 --> 01:33:12.262
with all the same problems
we had before,

01:33:12.295 --> 01:33:14.196
just waiting around
for you to come back

01:33:14.231 --> 01:33:17.066
and make the same
empty promises as last time.

01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:19.969
We used the system.

01:33:20.002 --> 01:33:21.338
You make millions of dollars

01:33:21.371 --> 01:33:23.105
funneling tens of millions
of dollars

01:33:23.139 --> 01:33:27.244
into this election economy.

01:33:27.277 --> 01:33:30.313
All we did is take a cut.

01:33:31.981 --> 01:33:33.550
Hmm.

01:33:33.583 --> 01:33:35.151
Well...

01:33:35.184 --> 01:33:37.721
I guess I just...

01:33:37.754 --> 01:33:42.426
I thought that maybe you and I
had a little something.

01:33:47.096 --> 01:33:50.032
I'm 28. I mean...

01:33:50.065 --> 01:33:53.969
In what world
would this be okay?

01:33:56.138 --> 01:33:58.241
D.C. and L.A.,
parts of New York,

01:33:58.275 --> 01:34:00.109
- Miami, maybe Dallas.
- Mm.

01:34:02.212 --> 01:34:04.214
Look...

01:34:05.248 --> 01:34:07.517
- It wasn't personal.
- Mm.

01:34:07.551 --> 01:34:09.286
It was math.

01:34:09.319 --> 01:34:11.053
Math.

01:34:12.222 --> 01:34:16.158
But this system,
the way we elect people,

01:34:16.192 --> 01:34:18.160
it's terrifying.

01:34:18.194 --> 01:34:20.196
And exhausting.

01:34:20.230 --> 01:34:23.333
And I think it's
driving us all insane.

01:34:31.575 --> 01:34:33.410
You know what
the real problem here

01:34:33.443 --> 01:34:35.445
is that the media
is completely complicit

01:34:35.479 --> 01:34:37.247
- in this sort of thing.
- Oh, I absolutely agree.

01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:38.515
I mean, it's like
Neil Postman said...

01:34:38.548 --> 01:34:40.115
in entertaining ourselves,

01:34:40.149 --> 01:34:41.785
- news has become entertainment.
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:34:41.818 --> 01:34:43.620
- And when that happens... it's gone.
- Yeah.

01:34:43.653 --> 01:34:45.355
I thought he knew.
I mean, I would get so nervous

01:34:45.388 --> 01:34:47.224
- every time he would come in. I would just, like...
- Oh, no.

01:34:47.257 --> 01:34:48.358
I couldn't get
my coffee order right,

01:34:48.391 --> 01:34:49.593
and I was giving him
the wrong thing.

01:34:49.626 --> 01:34:51.228
Oh, you were great.
You were perfect.

01:34:51.261 --> 01:34:52.529
Plus, you know, he has,
you know,

01:34:52.562 --> 01:34:54.297
dreamy eyes a little bit,
so, I mean...

01:34:54.331 --> 01:34:55.632
- Yeah.
- He's-he's dashing.

01:34:55.665 --> 01:34:58.100
He actually made me cry.

01:34:58.133 --> 01:35:00.403
- He was, like, a shithead.
- Yeah.

01:35:00.437 --> 01:35:02.305
It metastasizes,
so it-it's growing

01:35:02.339 --> 01:35:03.540
- and-and whatever, so...
- Yeah.

01:35:03.573 --> 01:35:05.208
Well, it becomes...
it's sort of like

01:35:05.242 --> 01:35:06.376
any sort of
autoimmune disorder.

01:35:06.409 --> 01:35:07.644
- Yeah.
- It's like... it's like lupus.

01:35:07.677 --> 01:35:09.144
Know what I mean?

01:35:09.178 --> 01:35:10.514
That's actually
a really great metaphor.

01:35:10.547 --> 01:35:12.382
- That's... that's like...
- It's a simile.

01:35:12.415 --> 01:35:14.049
- 'Cause you said...
- 'Cause I said...

01:35:14.083 --> 01:35:15.519
- I said it's "like."
- You said it's "like."

01:35:15.552 --> 01:35:17.152
Yeah, right.
It's like lupus.

01:35:18.421 --> 01:35:21.258
What a clusterfuck.

01:35:21.291 --> 01:35:23.293
Amen.

01:35:27.497 --> 01:35:29.164
<i>How we looking?</i>

01:35:29.198 --> 01:35:32.167
Well, they're saying
these, uh, back acres

01:35:32.202 --> 01:35:35.472
are gonna become the over-55
community health center.

01:35:35.505 --> 01:35:37.340
- Uh-huh.
- Madison has promised

01:35:37.374 --> 01:35:39.141
a satellite campus
for the front.

01:35:39.174 --> 01:35:41.278
Okay. And you know
that we have to redo

01:35:41.311 --> 01:35:42.546
the septic on the back 50?

01:35:42.579 --> 01:35:44.079
- We heard all about it.
- Okay.

01:35:44.113 --> 01:35:45.147
Hey, you.

01:35:45.180 --> 01:35:46.483
Oh, hey, you.

01:35:46.516 --> 01:35:49.286
She is something, huh?

01:35:55.392 --> 01:35:57.360
Are you listening to me?

01:36:00.162 --> 01:36:02.164
Are you listening to me?

01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:05.569
<i>Are you listening to me?</i>

01:36:05.602 --> 01:36:07.169
Oh, Gary, honey.

01:36:07.203 --> 01:36:08.538
I'm just so excited.

01:36:08.572 --> 01:36:10.607
I can't wait till we get
the café tables in.

01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:14.578
I think people are really gonna
like those a lot, you know?

01:36:14.611 --> 01:36:17.881
- And then we can put the umbrellas up.
- Mm-hmm.

01:36:17.914 --> 01:36:20.617
And people can just sit outside
and have coffee and...

01:36:20.650 --> 01:36:22.151
You know.

01:36:22.184 --> 01:36:23.420
Are you...
are you listening to me?

01:36:23.453 --> 01:36:25.622
- Mm-hmm, mm...
- Are you listening to me?

01:36:25.655 --> 01:36:28.157
Hey, fuckup. Hey, fuckup.

01:36:28.190 --> 01:36:30.694
- Are you listening to me?
- Yes, yes, yes.

01:36:30.727 --> 01:36:32.462
I'm listening to you.

01:36:32.495 --> 01:36:35.197
You don't open a dossier
for less than $2 million.

01:36:35.231 --> 01:36:37.601
I know. That's what I'm talking
to them about right now.

01:36:37.634 --> 01:36:39.235
$2 million.

01:36:39.269 --> 01:36:40.604
God, I hate you.

01:36:40.637 --> 01:36:42.339
Ditto.

01:36:44.374 --> 01:36:46.309
Gary?

01:36:46.343 --> 01:36:48.511
Gary, you there?

01:36:48.545 --> 01:36:50.547
Gary?

01:36:50.580 --> 01:36:52.515
Yo, Gary.

01:36:54.718 --> 01:36:56.185
Ah, cheers!

01:37:20.477 --> 01:37:22.712
Colonel Jack Hastings,
Deerlaken...

01:37:22.746 --> 01:37:24.781
did the media fall
for a false narrative

01:37:24.814 --> 01:37:27.283
just because it fit
into our preconceived notion

01:37:27.317 --> 01:37:29.653
of the divide of this country
between red and blue

01:37:29.686 --> 01:37:31.955
without actually
checking the facts?

01:37:31.988 --> 01:37:34.224
Were we irresponsible?

01:37:34.257 --> 01:37:35.392
Well, we're the news.

01:37:35.425 --> 01:37:37.961
Are we not supposed to
cover the news?

01:37:37.994 --> 01:37:39.963
I mean, these are
newsworthy stories.

01:37:39.996 --> 01:37:42.465
We're absolutely in the right
to cover them.

01:37:42.499 --> 01:37:46.269
It is literally our job
to cover the news.

01:37:46.302 --> 01:37:47.470
But isn't there a way
to report the news

01:37:47.504 --> 01:37:49.205
without so much speculation,

01:37:49.239 --> 01:37:51.274
without a false sense
of urgency

01:37:51.307 --> 01:37:53.977
that causes us to
breathlessly report "facts"

01:37:54.010 --> 01:37:55.512
that maybe are not facts?

01:37:55.545 --> 01:37:57.547
And are we framing
these stories

01:37:57.580 --> 01:37:59.582
on an artificial
right-left axis

01:37:59.616 --> 01:38:02.519
because that's how
our pundit economy is set up?

01:38:02.552 --> 01:38:04.554
Is there a better way
to do this?

01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:11.161
I'm just kidding.

01:38:11.193 --> 01:38:12.762
Unfortunately,
we have to leave it there.

01:38:12.796 --> 01:38:15.231
- Thank you all for watching.
- She's...

01:38:15.265 --> 01:38:16.733

Could something

Legally, this could
absolutely happen.

01:39:19.596 --> 01:39:24.434
Somebody could create
a political organization...

01:39:24.467 --> 01:39:28.471
so-called outside group,
a super PAC, 527...

01:39:28.505 --> 01:39:31.374
raise an unlimited
amount of money,

01:39:31.407 --> 01:39:34.577
and then choose
to give that money

01:39:34.611 --> 01:39:37.514
to another organization,
a charity,

01:39:37.547 --> 01:39:40.483
and use it for public purposes.

01:39:40.517 --> 01:39:43.720
And you don't need
the donors' consent to do that.

01:39:43.753 --> 01:39:45.789
The problem we have is that

01:39:45.822 --> 01:39:49.526
none of the pieces of
the system are working today.

01:39:49.559 --> 01:39:52.829
You have regulators like
the Federal Election Commission

01:39:52.862 --> 01:39:54.764
that don't have a quorum,
can't meet,

01:39:54.798 --> 01:39:57.667
and when they do, they disagree
on what the law is.

01:39:57.700 --> 01:40:01.471
You have Congress deadlocked
so it can't rewrite the laws.

01:40:01.504 --> 01:40:03.473
You have the Supreme Court

01:40:03.506 --> 01:40:06.943
that thinks that
almost nothing is corrupt

01:40:06.976 --> 01:40:11.548
and that citizens won't think
the sale of access...

01:40:11.581 --> 01:40:13.817
what the court calls
ingratiation

01:40:13.850 --> 01:40:18.588
in return for giving money
to candidates... is a problem.

01:40:18.621 --> 01:40:21.424
So, to sum up,
we currently have

01:40:21.457 --> 01:40:22.826
hundreds of millions
to billions of dollars

01:40:22.859 --> 01:40:25.428
that is, uh, uh, untraceable,

01:40:25.461 --> 01:40:27.897
uh, that can pour into groups

01:40:27.931 --> 01:40:30.900
that are actually coordinating
with-with candidates

01:40:30.934 --> 01:40:33.870
who end up having to spend
a good amount of their time

01:40:33.903 --> 01:40:35.839
raising more and more money
to keep up

01:40:35.872 --> 01:40:38.808
with the arms race
that is occurring.

01:40:38.842 --> 01:40:42.846
Uh, the money continues
to pour in and corrupt

01:40:42.879 --> 01:40:45.582
not just where
they spend their time

01:40:45.615 --> 01:40:48.718
and how they spend their time
but on the types of legislation

01:40:48.751 --> 01:40:51.621
that they would even bring
to the fore.

01:40:51.654 --> 01:40:54.591
And the one group
that would be charged

01:40:54.624 --> 01:40:59.696
with regulating, uh,
this spigot, uh, doesn't meet

01:40:59.729 --> 01:41:01.865
'cause there aren't
enough of them.

01:41:01.898 --> 01:41:03.867
Yes.

01:41:07.003 --> 01:41:09.472
I realize that's not helpful
to you, but...

01:41:09.505 --> 01:41:11.407
It is very helpful.
Thank you.
