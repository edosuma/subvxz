01:02.235 --> 01:03.725
-Dad?
-Yeah?

01:03.870 --> 01:05.394
The water's green.

01:07.974 --> 01:10.033
No, it's fluorescent.

01:10.143 --> 01:12.407
-What's...
-Fluorescent.

01:15.448 --> 01:18.349
Fluorescent means "lit from within."

01:20.286 --> 01:22.186
So am I fluorescent?

01:26.392 --> 01:28.019
Yeah, Dory, you are.

01:51.417 --> 01:53.112
It's okay, honey.

02:00.593 --> 02:03.061
Why has Grandma
been sleeping all day?

02:05.431 --> 02:07.831
Well, she's sedated, sweetie.

02:09.301 --> 02:12.100
I don't know
what that word means, Mom.

02:12.705 --> 02:18.109
It means that she's been taking pills
so she can sleep.

02:22.682 --> 02:24.775
She lost her son, Harper.

02:26.152 --> 02:29.644
There's nothing more painful
in the whole wide world.

02:30.690 --> 02:32.817
More than losing your dad?

02:34.994 --> 02:36.256
Different.

02:39.832 --> 02:41.299
Different.

03:11.731 --> 03:14.029
-Cousin Laura's coming.
-Really? Why?

03:14.166 --> 03:17.101
I haven't spoken to her in over 10 years.

03:21.741 --> 03:23.766
That's Brian's computer.

03:27.847 --> 03:31.010
I can't go in there, so can you...

03:31.150 --> 03:34.210
Okay. Okay. It's okay. I got it.

03:46.832 --> 03:49.062
Who is "Snakes290"?

03:49.201 --> 03:50.634
Oh, God.

03:50.736 --> 03:55.673
He's an old college friend of Brian's
that now lives in Michigan.

03:55.775 --> 03:56.969
What does it say?

03:57.076 --> 04:01.035
He said, "What do you think of
the Sonics' new power forward?"

04:04.250 --> 04:06.582
Well, what did he think of them?

04:07.353 --> 04:08.980
He thought he was a good rebounder,

04:09.088 --> 04:12.057
but his outside jumper
needed some work.

04:12.191 --> 04:13.818
Then write that.

04:19.732 --> 04:22.166
All right. I can do that.

04:29.442 --> 04:30.932
Shit!

04:31.077 --> 04:32.601
-What? What? What?
-Shit!

04:32.745 --> 04:33.939
What's wrong, Audrey?

04:34.080 --> 04:36.378
-I forgot to tell somebody.
-Who?

04:36.482 --> 04:39.246
Neal, can you take me down to Renton?

04:39.385 --> 04:42.718
-Renton? You can't call?
-No, he doesn't have a phone.

04:42.822 --> 04:44.084
Who doesn't have a phone, sweetie?

04:44.223 --> 04:47.715
-Can you take me?
-No, honey! Come on, now!

04:47.827 --> 04:51.786
Okay, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's all right. It's all right.

04:51.931 --> 04:53.296
I can go.

04:54.066 --> 04:55.863
Look, right around here from...

04:55.968 --> 05:00.632
There's his address book,
and look up a Jerry Sunborne.

05:00.773 --> 05:02.741
Who's Jerry Sunborne, darling?

05:03.976 --> 05:06.308
Who the hell is Jerry Sunborne?

05:41.614 --> 05:42.945
You want something to eat?

05:43.048 --> 05:44.743
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

06:08.040 --> 06:09.803
I just couldn't...

06:12.344 --> 06:15.211
-Do you have another one of those?
-Yeah.

06:16.515 --> 06:17.846
Thank you.

06:27.760 --> 06:30.126
I'm Howard Glassman.

06:31.163 --> 06:32.323
I'm Jerry.

06:34.934 --> 06:36.993
How did you know Brian?

06:38.170 --> 06:39.967
We grew up together.

06:43.175 --> 06:48.306
I just live down the street
and financed some of his deals...

06:53.018 --> 06:55.145
-Oh, no.
-I'm sorry.

06:55.254 --> 06:57.347
Well, I'm...

06:59.592 --> 07:00.854
My wife.

07:01.927 --> 07:04.327
It's nice to meet you, Jerry.

07:05.564 --> 07:07.964
So you started smoking again?

07:30.189 --> 07:31.713
Come on! Get out of the way!

07:31.857 --> 07:34.655
All right! I bet you I could jump over it!

07:34.760 --> 07:36.421
I'm gonna jump over it!

07:40.232 --> 07:42.097
You don't know?

07:42.234 --> 07:44.862
I guess your brain's
growing up too small.

07:46.038 --> 07:49.405
-Hey.
-Hello. Hi.

07:49.542 --> 07:51.100
Hi. I'm David.

07:51.243 --> 07:54.076
My name is Jerry. You're Harper.

07:54.914 --> 07:56.211
-Yeah.
-Hi.

07:56.315 --> 07:58.374
-Hi.
-Dory.

08:06.625 --> 08:08.889
Your dad was my best friend.

08:11.330 --> 08:12.558
When?

08:15.634 --> 08:18.262
When I was your age, and last week.

08:26.312 --> 08:29.475
<i>Strawberry Fields Forever
is your favorite song.</i>

08:29.615 --> 08:33.244
And Dory's got that scar on his nose

08:33.352 --> 08:36.287
'cause he was running and he thought
the screen door was open.

08:36.422 --> 08:38.116
But it was closed.

08:38.256 --> 08:40.384
Everybody knows that, Dory.

08:41.126 --> 08:43.116
You don't like mimes.
They scare you.

08:43.261 --> 08:45.230
They don't talk.

08:45.331 --> 08:47.925
Yeah, that's what they do.

08:50.002 --> 08:51.765
Your suit is a little big.

08:54.807 --> 08:55.899
Thank you.

08:56.008 --> 08:58.306
That was imprudent of you.

08:58.444 --> 09:00.469
I bet you can't do this.

09:04.383 --> 09:05.509
Fast.

09:38.851 --> 09:40.614
-Hi.
-Hey, Jerry.

09:42.855 --> 09:44.379
I'm so sorry.

09:50.429 --> 09:52.158
Thanks for coming.

09:52.765 --> 09:53.823
I'm really glad you came.

09:53.932 --> 09:57.390
I wasn't so sure
you would actually come,

09:57.536 --> 09:59.663
-so, thank you.
-No problem.

10:05.110 --> 10:06.634
I hated you.

10:13.919 --> 10:16.979
I hated you for so many years, Jerry.

10:17.089 --> 10:18.647
It's all right.

10:19.224 --> 10:22.716
And now, it just all seems so silly.

10:27.132 --> 10:31.330
He was so loyal to a fault, you know.

10:33.972 --> 10:37.601
Most people would've given up on you.
Hell, I would've.

10:41.480 --> 10:43.038
But he didn't.

10:47.586 --> 10:48.780
I know.

10:54.460 --> 10:55.757
I'm gonna go.

10:55.894 --> 10:57.555
No, I... Wait.

10:58.630 --> 11:00.791
I need you to stay.

11:00.933 --> 11:03.902
Please, can you just stay for a little bit?

11:04.002 --> 11:06.630
-Sure.
-Just a little bit?

11:06.772 --> 11:09.468
Sure. Sure.

11:11.577 --> 11:12.601
Good.

11:20.786 --> 11:22.651
So Brian is maybe six years old,

11:22.788 --> 11:25.723
and we're the Andersons' guests
at Flathead Country Club,

11:25.824 --> 11:27.416
and we're swimming in the pool,

11:27.526 --> 11:29.494
and all of the sudden,
Brian gets out of the water

11:29.628 --> 11:32.756
and he pulls his bathing suit down
and he takes a piss right in the pool.

11:32.865 --> 11:35.993
And people are just freaking out.

11:36.135 --> 11:38.126
June Anderson is freaking out.

11:38.270 --> 11:40.500
People are going,
"What are you doing?"

11:40.639 --> 11:43.904
I mean, he's peeing right in the pool
like it's a urinal, so...

11:44.009 --> 11:45.636
Wow.

11:45.778 --> 11:49.407
And when it was over I say,
"Brian, why did you do that?"

11:49.515 --> 11:52.075
You know, I mean, he wasn't a bad kid.

11:52.184 --> 11:54.652
He never acted out.
He's quiet, you know.

11:55.821 --> 12:00.485
And I said...
Okay, I'm totally messing this story up!

12:01.994 --> 12:05.452
I said, "Why'd you..." Shut up!

12:05.564 --> 12:07.964
I said, "Why did you do that?"

12:08.066 --> 12:11.092
And he came back with something
that made no sense.

12:11.203 --> 12:15.299
Shit. I forget what he said.
It was so funny. Shoot.

12:15.407 --> 12:17.932
He said he didn't want
to get his bathing suit wet.

12:18.043 --> 12:20.944
Yes! That was it!

12:21.046 --> 12:24.812
"I didn't want...
I didn't want to get my bathing suit wet!"

12:24.917 --> 12:26.441
That's okay!

12:26.552 --> 12:29.214
He was a little retarded as a kid,
you know.

12:29.354 --> 12:34.223
No, I'm sorry, but he was. He was...
He was slow, you know.

12:34.359 --> 12:37.726
And, you know,
he came around eventually.

12:50.909 --> 12:52.240
We home?

13:02.921 --> 13:04.912
Don't let them grow up.

13:32.484 --> 13:38.184
How about I make us some pasta?
Open the wine.

13:39.224 --> 13:44.218
That way our vacation won't have to end
till tomorrow.

13:48.767 --> 13:50.428
When I get back.

13:51.436 --> 13:54.030
-No. No, Brian...
-I have to.

13:54.139 --> 13:55.470
-Why?
-It's his birthday.

13:55.607 --> 13:56.631
So?

13:56.775 --> 13:58.936
Audrey, you didn't know him
when he was a kid. He was special.

13:59.077 --> 14:00.203
Every time you leave here, Brian,

14:00.312 --> 14:01.802
I'm scared to death
you're not gonna come back.

14:01.947 --> 14:04.472
Oh, Jesus,
just stop being so damn dramatic.

14:04.616 --> 14:06.550
You stop being so damn naive.

14:06.652 --> 14:08.711
Audrey, it's his birthday.

14:08.820 --> 14:12.153
Who the hell knows
how many more he's gonna have?

14:18.797 --> 14:20.094
Mom?

15:26.031 --> 15:27.692
-Hey, Jay.
-Hey.

15:28.800 --> 15:30.324
Happy Birthday!

15:30.435 --> 15:32.027
-August 3rd.
-August 3rd.

15:32.137 --> 15:33.570
Yeah.

15:33.705 --> 15:36.572
-You're an old man.
-Yeah.

15:36.708 --> 15:38.608
Come on in. Come on in.

15:38.744 --> 15:41.679
-She okay?
-Yeah, she's fine. Have a seat.

15:46.385 --> 15:49.320
I'm hungry.
You want to get something to eat?

15:49.421 --> 15:51.514
-Yeah. Cool.
-Yeah? Let's go out.

15:52.157 --> 15:53.954
-They got coffee, strawberry...
-No coffee. Strawberry.

15:54.092 --> 15:56.583
-Strawberry?
-Yeah.

15:56.728 --> 15:59.788
-Will you try and find some soup?
-Okay.

15:59.931 --> 16:01.523
So they're not happy with the work,
you know?

16:01.633 --> 16:04.261
I think I'm gonna fire the workers.

16:06.471 --> 16:08.905
And Audrey's fucking someone else.

16:10.242 --> 16:11.903
Are you checking to see if I'm listening?

16:12.010 --> 16:13.875
No, man. You don't understand.

16:13.979 --> 16:19.076
This woman looks so good there is
no way that she is only fucking me.

16:19.184 --> 16:21.049
Our neighbor's this guy
named Landon Hicks.

16:21.153 --> 16:23.815
He's this rugged,
mountain-man type guy.

16:23.955 --> 16:28.392
Big beard. Big hair. Doesn't even talk.

16:28.493 --> 16:30.654
She's in love with Landon Hicks!

16:30.796 --> 16:32.957
Well, you gotta take
the good with the bad.

16:33.098 --> 16:34.929
What's the good?

16:35.033 --> 16:37.763
Are you still...

16:37.869 --> 16:39.268
Yes, I am.

16:43.608 --> 16:45.803
I mean, you're still in the rotation,
you know what I'm saying?

16:46.945 --> 16:49.846
You know,
you gotta accept the good, man,

16:49.981 --> 16:52.245
'cause they're gonna
make you accept the bad.

16:52.350 --> 16:55.114
You have everything
any man would want.

16:55.220 --> 16:58.451
Accept the good, Bri.
You have what I'll never have.

16:58.557 --> 17:01.617
Oh, come on, don't talk
like that about yourself, all right?

17:01.726 --> 17:06.026
Brian, you're my only real friend
left in the world, you know that?

17:11.903 --> 17:14.666
Audrey angry
you came to see me tonight?

17:15.740 --> 17:16.832
No.

17:20.045 --> 17:21.171
Yes.

17:22.914 --> 17:26.145
I don't know why you're so dead set
against seeing her again.

17:26.251 --> 17:30.210
Well, I don't want to see anybody
until I'm clean. That's why.

17:37.195 --> 17:40.528
So, the Fed raised rates.
Is that gonna affect you?

17:41.166 --> 17:44.533
No, people will still buy.
This refi boom's got good legs.

17:44.669 --> 17:45.966
Good.

18:30.782 --> 18:31.942
Yeah?

18:33.385 --> 18:34.545
Jerry?

18:35.320 --> 18:38.380
Maybe. Who is it?

18:38.490 --> 18:40.958
I'm Audrey Burke's brother, Neal.

18:48.266 --> 18:50.257
Can you open the door, please?

18:50.402 --> 18:51.460
Yeah.

19:02.981 --> 19:04.209
Yeah.

19:06.818 --> 19:08.046
Yeah?

19:10.021 --> 19:11.750
Brian is dead.

19:12.657 --> 19:13.919
He was killed.

19:14.025 --> 19:17.153
Somebody killed him, and he's dead.

19:19.431 --> 19:21.991
What the fuck are you talking about?

19:23.535 --> 19:25.002
He's dead.

19:31.176 --> 19:33.235
Are you fucking with me?

19:34.346 --> 19:37.975
Some guy was beating up on his wife
and Brian...

19:41.319 --> 19:42.445
What?

19:43.355 --> 19:44.913
Brian's dead.

19:46.825 --> 19:48.656
The funeral is today.

19:55.867 --> 19:58.495
I'm here to take you to the funeral.

20:03.842 --> 20:06.572
You better not be fucking with me, man.

20:12.550 --> 20:14.643
Do you have a suit?

20:14.753 --> 20:16.653
Yeah, I got a suit.

20:25.897 --> 20:28.161
At this time,
on behalf of the Burke family,

20:28.266 --> 20:34.171
I'd like to thank those of you who have
been able to spend this time with us.

20:34.272 --> 20:36.263
Many of you
have traveled a long distance,

20:36.408 --> 20:38.342
and it is much appreciated.

20:38.443 --> 20:42.607
In a few moments, we'll be going
to the Burke residence for the reception.

20:50.455 --> 20:53.686
Okay? Okay.

21:33.765 --> 21:37.326
Hey, what about chicken, Harper?
You can eat chicken, can't you?

21:37.469 --> 21:40.097
Chickens are animals, Dad.
I don't eat animals.

21:40.205 --> 21:41.331
Since when?

21:41.473 --> 21:44.135
-Since meat is murder.
-No more meat, honey.

21:44.275 --> 21:45.799
-Dad?
-Meat is murder.

21:45.944 --> 21:47.172
-Dad?
-Basically.

21:47.312 --> 21:48.472
-Daddy?
-Where did you learn this?

21:48.613 --> 21:50.740
I know things.
Not everything I know was learned.

21:50.849 --> 21:51.941
-Well, actually, that's not true.
-Dad!

21:52.050 --> 21:53.677
The nature of knowledge
is that you learned it somewhere.

21:53.818 --> 21:55.012
-Dad!
-Yes?

21:55.153 --> 21:57.178
-I like meat.
-I know you do.

21:57.322 --> 21:58.755
He likes meat, Harper.

21:58.857 --> 21:59.949
And he's gonna get bigger than you.

22:00.058 --> 22:01.753
She does eat broccoli.

22:01.860 --> 22:03.851
-I see.
-Don't you, baby?

22:06.564 --> 22:08.794
Did you take 60 bucks
out of the car, babe?

22:08.900 --> 22:10.663
No.

22:10.802 --> 22:13.168
That's funny, 'cause I had
three $20s in the ashtray,

22:13.304 --> 22:14.328
and now they're gone.

22:14.472 --> 22:16.303
No. I didn't take it.

22:22.414 --> 22:25.281
Was your friend in the car
the other night?

22:26.818 --> 22:28.308
He didn't take it.

22:28.420 --> 22:30.320
-Who?
-He wouldn't take it.

22:30.422 --> 22:32.049
Who? Who wouldn't take it?

22:32.190 --> 22:34.681
-Would you wake up, Brian?
-Nobody.

22:34.826 --> 22:36.054
Wake up!

22:39.164 --> 22:40.893
-Wake up!
-All right.

22:41.766 --> 22:43.563
-Mom, who?
-Jesus.

22:46.438 --> 22:50.067
Meat is so murder! Get her! Get her!

22:50.208 --> 22:51.971
-Get her.
-Well, it is.

22:54.379 --> 22:55.641
Yeah, come in.

22:55.747 --> 22:58.409
Yeah, I know.
I can't stay. I gotta take off.

22:58.550 --> 22:59.847
Oh, okay.

22:59.951 --> 23:02.647
Well, it was very nice
hanging out with you.

23:02.754 --> 23:05.882
You know I appreciate it
more than you know, man.

23:06.024 --> 23:08.151
-Well...
-Really.

23:08.259 --> 23:10.386
-Happy birthday, man.
-Okay.

23:12.764 --> 23:14.561
All right.

23:14.699 --> 23:17.532
-It's good to see you.
-Take care.

23:17.635 --> 23:19.830
Hey, don't forget the...

23:21.239 --> 23:22.433
Don't forget what?

23:22.574 --> 23:24.838
-Groceries.
-What?

23:33.384 --> 23:34.749
Hey, pretty boy.

24:31.042 --> 24:33.237
It's way past her bedtime.

24:35.647 --> 24:40.482
Oh, no, you're not watching
that Lifetime movie again, are you?

24:40.618 --> 24:42.483
It's this commercial we just saw.

24:42.620 --> 24:44.417
You're crying over a commercial?

24:44.522 --> 24:48.014
Do you have any idea what they're doing
to baby seals in Alaska, honey?

24:48.159 --> 24:51.526
They were so cute, Dad.
Please, give them a lot of money.

24:51.663 --> 24:52.652
I wrote down the Web site.

24:52.797 --> 24:54.856
-We need to make a really big donation.
-Okay. Okay, good.

24:54.999 --> 24:56.466
Harper, out.

24:57.902 --> 24:58.926
Out.

25:00.638 --> 25:03.266
-Good night, honey.
-Good night, Mom.

25:04.208 --> 25:05.698
Seal hater.

25:11.015 --> 25:13.540
Seal hater. Nice to meet you.

25:13.685 --> 25:15.653
I'm gonna go wash up.

25:25.563 --> 25:26.264
So how was he?

25:26.264 --> 25:26.958
So how was he?

25:27.999 --> 25:30.160
He's all fucked up, Audrey.

25:31.936 --> 25:33.733
All fucked up.

25:33.871 --> 25:38.740
You know, he said this thing to me,
didn't strike me until I was driving home.

25:38.876 --> 25:41.470
He asked me if the Feds raising
the rates would affect my business.

25:41.579 --> 25:43.979
Now, that has no relevance for Jerry
in his world, right?

25:44.082 --> 25:45.879
He would have read it somewhere
and just remembered it

25:45.984 --> 25:48.350
because he knew
it had relevance for me, you see?

25:48.453 --> 25:49.715
And I know that you think I just go there

25:49.854 --> 25:52.516
and I give, and I give, and he just takes,

25:52.624 --> 25:53.750
but, you know, he's my friend.

25:53.891 --> 25:56.519
He looks out for me, you understand?

25:57.028 --> 25:58.552
He's my friend.

25:59.297 --> 26:00.423
Okay.

26:14.779 --> 26:17.009
You know, they forgot to put
the dimmers on the lights.

26:17.115 --> 26:21.381
I am gonna fire those guys,
and I'm gonna go with the Polish guys.

26:30.995 --> 26:33.623
You're taking the kids swimming
at Howard's tomorrow.

26:33.765 --> 26:36.563
All right. Dory's putting his head under.

26:36.668 --> 26:39.933
-Go easy on him, baby.
-Even if I have to push it.

26:40.071 --> 26:41.902
Well, that's nice.

26:43.341 --> 26:46.276
I told Jerry
you were fucking Landon Hicks.

26:47.445 --> 26:48.810
You what?

26:50.782 --> 26:53.580
-Landon Hicks?
-He knows I was joking.

26:53.685 --> 26:57.121
-Why would I be fucking Landon Hicks?
-I don't know.

26:57.422 --> 26:58.650
If I was gonna sleep with somebody

26:58.790 --> 27:01.315
it sure as hell
wouldn't be Landon Hicks.

27:01.459 --> 27:02.983
No? Why not?

27:03.127 --> 27:06.426
Because he doesn't speak. That's why.

27:06.698 --> 27:08.427
Who would it be?

27:15.807 --> 27:17.331
The water guy.

27:18.443 --> 27:19.808
The water guy?

27:20.645 --> 27:21.669
Why?

27:22.980 --> 27:24.106
Because.

27:24.215 --> 27:26.410
Why the water guy?

27:26.517 --> 27:30.180
'Cause he reminds me of a cowboy.

27:30.855 --> 27:33.085
The guy that brings
the Arrowhead water

27:33.191 --> 27:35.682
reminds you of a cowboy.

27:35.827 --> 27:37.294
Oh, yeah.

27:40.231 --> 27:43.325
Shouldn't have asked
if you didn't want to know.

27:45.136 --> 27:47.195
Come on. Do it.

27:49.173 --> 27:50.697
Okay, do it.

27:52.410 --> 27:53.672
Please do it.

27:56.380 --> 27:57.779
Come here.

28:00.351 --> 28:01.682
That's it.

28:20.204 --> 28:21.728
You guys need anything?

28:21.873 --> 28:23.636
No, thanks, Howard.
You gonna come in?

28:23.741 --> 28:26.175
-He doesn't swim.
-Okay.

28:26.277 --> 28:29.508
Who spends $200,000
on a swimming pool and doesn't swim?

28:29.614 --> 28:30.842
All right, Doris, that's enough.

28:30.948 --> 28:33.644
Maybe next time,
you'll try building a mosque.

28:34.051 --> 28:37.509
That's funny.
We'll be back in a couple of hours.

28:37.622 --> 28:39.681
-One, two, three.
-Two...

28:43.928 --> 28:46.920
-What happened?
-I don't feel like it.

28:47.064 --> 28:49.828
He's just being difficult
for the attention, Dad.

28:49.934 --> 28:51.026
Thank you, Dr. Freud.

28:51.135 --> 28:53.603
Why don't you go touch the drain
or something?

28:53.738 --> 28:55.501
Now, look, Dory, just try.

28:55.606 --> 28:57.733
-I already did!
-No, you didn't.

28:57.875 --> 28:59.672
Now, look, you got to face your fears.

28:59.777 --> 29:02.371
Everybody has to in life, okay?
Now, you're a man.

29:02.480 --> 29:05.745
You're almost six years old.
It's time. Now, let's do it.

29:05.883 --> 29:07.544
I don't have to! You can't make me!

29:07.652 --> 29:09.051
No, I can make you.

29:09.153 --> 29:11.280
Baby! You're kidding.

29:12.290 --> 29:13.348
-Am I kidding?
-Aren't you?

29:13.457 --> 29:16.085
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we were kidding, right?
Why don't you go to Mommy?

29:16.227 --> 29:18.218
-Yeah.
-I'll go swim with your sister.

29:18.329 --> 29:20.524
Come on, baby. Come with Mommy.

29:20.631 --> 29:25.796
'Cause your daddy
is a very abusive man.

29:34.245 --> 29:35.371
Hey.

29:36.447 --> 29:40.577
I put walnut stain on this thing.
Totally fucked it up.

29:42.587 --> 29:44.612
No, you didn't, I think it looks good.

29:44.755 --> 29:47.155
You think I'm ever gonna get
an honest answer out of you,

29:47.291 --> 29:50.658
or are you just gonna
love every single thing I do?

29:54.632 --> 29:58.090
It's... You know, I think it's ugly.

29:59.971 --> 30:01.404
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

30:01.505 --> 30:04.406
I steam it. I sand it. I stain it.

30:04.508 --> 30:07.409
And after all of that,
I only got one chance at the finish.

30:07.511 --> 30:11.174
And if I screw that up,
then the whole thing is messed up.

30:11.315 --> 30:15.809
Well, what do I know?
'Cause I'm just here to deliver the water.

30:51.722 --> 30:52.848
Dad!

30:55.860 --> 30:57.293
I promised them Cold Stone.

30:57.395 --> 30:58.987
Dad!

30:59.096 --> 31:01.155
To be continued.

31:01.265 --> 31:02.289
Okay?

31:02.400 --> 31:03.992
To be continued.

31:06.203 --> 31:08.637
-Don't move, all right?
-I won't.

31:12.777 --> 31:13.971
Hey, hey!

31:14.078 --> 31:15.568
Daddy, I want strawberry and vanilla.

31:15.713 --> 31:17.146
Okay. Strawberry and vanilla?

31:17.248 --> 31:19.045
Yeah! And Dory wants chocolate,
strawberry and vanilla.

31:19.183 --> 31:20.980
What do you mean
strawberry and vanilla?

31:21.085 --> 31:22.416
And Mom wants lemon.

31:22.553 --> 31:24.214
-Lemon? All right.
-Yeah.

31:34.231 --> 31:35.425
I'll be back in a little while.

31:35.566 --> 31:36.999
-Bye!
-Bye.

31:44.709 --> 31:45.835
Dory.

31:47.912 --> 31:52.372
You look like a little puppy
waiting for its owner.

31:53.985 --> 31:56.112
Where's my ice cream?

31:58.155 --> 31:59.952
-Excuse me.
-Mom.

32:19.276 --> 32:22.268
That's funny. He's not answering.

33:06.390 --> 33:08.449
Are you Mrs. Brian Burke?

33:15.533 --> 33:18.297
-You love me. You love me.
-No.

33:18.402 --> 33:20.996
-Damn it! You bitch!
-No!

33:21.138 --> 33:23.606
You don't love him, you love me!
Do you hear me?

33:23.707 --> 33:25.265
Fuck! And you lied to me!

33:25.376 --> 33:27.503
Don't you ever say that to me again,
do you hear me?

33:27.645 --> 33:29.943
-Don't you ever say that to me!
-Hey! Stop! Stop that!

33:30.047 --> 33:31.674
-That's my wife! That's my wife!
-Stop! I don't care.

33:31.816 --> 33:33.283
You're hurting her! Just leave her alone!

33:33.384 --> 33:34.544
-You told me you were over him!
-Stop!

33:34.685 --> 33:36.550
Stop! Back off!

33:43.260 --> 33:46.195
<i>-God.
-Just breathe and count to 10.</i>

33:46.330 --> 33:47.319
<i>I'm breathing, man, all right?</i>

33:47.431 --> 33:49.365
<i>Count to 10 for me.</i>

33:51.268 --> 33:57.798
-One, two, three, four...
-Yeah, all right, man.

33:59.910 --> 34:01.070
Yes, hi.

34:01.212 --> 34:05.376
I need an ambulance
to Southwest Vista and Elm.

34:05.516 --> 34:10.248
I got a woman here. She's beaten.
She's badly beaten. It's domestic and...

34:15.693 --> 34:16.853
No!

34:26.871 --> 34:28.498
I've got two kids.

34:31.041 --> 34:36.570
I've got a 10-year-old girl
and a six-year-old little boy.

34:39.116 --> 34:42.574
And they're in there waiting

34:42.719 --> 34:45.746
for their daddy to come home
with ice cream.

34:47.725 --> 34:49.283
I'm so sorry.

35:04.975 --> 35:06.602
What's going on?

37:27.751 --> 37:29.048
Jerry?

37:30.487 --> 37:32.045
Oh, I'm sorry.

37:32.156 --> 37:34.249
He doesn't live here anymore.

37:34.391 --> 37:37.019
Okay, can you tell me
where I can find him?

37:37.127 --> 37:38.856
Try the McKinley Clinic.

37:40.164 --> 37:43.099
Okay, the McKinley Clinic. Okay.

38:06.490 --> 38:07.787
-Hey!
-Hi.

38:10.794 --> 38:12.785
What are you doing here?

38:15.332 --> 38:18.563
I don't know.
I just wanted to see how you were.

38:20.371 --> 38:22.066
Good to see you.

38:23.974 --> 38:25.771
Want some coffee? Water?

38:27.144 --> 38:28.736
-Yeah.
-Come on.

38:35.119 --> 38:38.782
So this is a methadone clinic?

38:38.889 --> 38:40.117
Yeah.

38:42.292 --> 38:45.284
-You take methadone?
-Not me.

38:47.398 --> 38:51.459
I just help around the clinic
and they give me a place to stay.

39:02.679 --> 39:05.045
When was the last time you used?

39:06.216 --> 39:08.377
Sixteen days ago.

39:08.519 --> 39:12.478
I tried to quit after the funeral,
but I relapsed.

39:23.934 --> 39:25.834
So how are the kids?

39:31.208 --> 39:33.574
Harper's messing up in school.

39:35.679 --> 39:36.873
And Dory is

39:39.116 --> 39:42.574
having nightmares
where his daddy is the monster.

39:52.196 --> 39:54.596
-Would you like some more?
-No.

39:57.868 --> 39:59.665
I'm gonna shove off.

40:04.608 --> 40:07.543
-Stop it, Harper!
-I'm not doing anything.

40:14.718 --> 40:16.777
Stop it, Harper!

40:16.954 --> 40:20.515
-Mom!
-Harper! Stop it!

40:20.624 --> 40:23.115
You two are acting like little brats!

40:23.260 --> 40:28.357
All I asked you to do this morning
was to sit here and eat quietly.

40:28.465 --> 40:31.298
But you can't even seem to do that,
can you? Don't laugh, Dory!

40:31.435 --> 40:32.561
-Okay!
-It's not funny!

40:57.261 --> 41:00.719
Mom? Can I sleep with you?

41:00.831 --> 41:03.129
Yeah, honey. Come on.

41:04.835 --> 41:07.269
Right here. There we go.

41:34.665 --> 41:36.098
Oh, shit.

42:23.714 --> 42:26.808
-Hey! Okay, look, here's the deal.
-Hi.

42:26.917 --> 42:29.147
We had a fire in our garage.

42:29.252 --> 42:32.813
The good news, we started to rebuild it.

42:32.923 --> 42:35.824
The bad news, never finished it.

42:35.926 --> 42:39.987
So, right now, all it is,
is a room with a bathroom.

42:42.132 --> 42:44.396
You can't stay here, Jerry.

42:47.137 --> 42:49.332
You're nuts.

42:49.439 --> 42:50.565
Why?

42:52.609 --> 42:54.338
Because it's free.

42:57.147 --> 42:58.876
I don't need your charity, Audrey.

42:58.982 --> 43:03.112
Who's offering you charity?
I'm the one that needs the help here.

43:04.454 --> 43:07.787
Really, you know
how high my mortgage is?

43:07.924 --> 43:10.051
You can move in, get yourself situated,

43:10.160 --> 43:13.891
and, eventually, you can get a job
and you can pay me rent.

43:27.177 --> 43:29.907
So how come
Brian never mentioned you?

43:31.348 --> 43:34.715
'Cause I'm a recovering heroin addict,
maybe?

43:46.697 --> 43:48.324
I hate my wife.

43:50.534 --> 43:52.798
I mean, since we're sharing.

43:54.271 --> 43:56.432
I hate everything about her.

43:57.374 --> 44:01.310
And she is gonna be furious when
she finds out I gave this shit to you.

44:01.445 --> 44:02.571
Okay.

44:20.363 --> 44:21.591
-Hey, Dory.
-Hi.

44:21.698 --> 44:24.496
You gonna give us a hand? Okay, cool.

44:30.907 --> 44:32.272
Hey, Dory.

44:37.347 --> 44:38.712
You got it?

44:40.417 --> 44:44.649
-There we go.
-Good job, good job. Good job.

44:53.764 --> 44:55.698
Yeah? Come in.

44:59.603 --> 45:01.298
It's dinnertime.

45:03.507 --> 45:04.997
-Dinnertime?
-Yeah.

45:05.108 --> 45:07.076
My mom wanted me to come over
and get you.

45:07.210 --> 45:08.199
Okay.

45:09.613 --> 45:13.481
I need to put on my soles.

45:13.583 --> 45:18.816
I got two soles, one and two.

45:20.257 --> 45:22.054
Okay, let's do it.

45:29.065 --> 45:30.657
-Come on, that would be so cool!
-Yeah.

45:30.767 --> 45:33.065
-Yeah, that is so funny.
-Yeah.

45:33.203 --> 45:34.363
-Hey, Jerry.
-How you doing?

45:34.471 --> 45:37.099
Come on in. Have a seat.

45:37.240 --> 45:40.539
Girls? Girls, this is Jerry.

45:40.644 --> 45:42.737
-Jerry, this is Emily.
-Hi, Emily.

45:42.879 --> 45:44.904
-And this is Sarah.
-Hi, Sarah.

45:45.048 --> 45:48.882
And Jerry is a really good friend
of our family

45:48.985 --> 45:51.078
who's gonna have dinner
with us tonight, okay?

45:51.221 --> 45:52.210
So, who wants chicken?

45:52.322 --> 45:53.550
-Oh, me!
-Yeah?

45:53.657 --> 45:56.558
-Chicken. Jerry?
-No, I'm a vegetarian.

45:56.660 --> 45:58.355
You are? So am I.

45:58.461 --> 45:59.758
-Meat is murder.
-I want chicken.

45:59.896 --> 46:02.888
I'm gonna give it to you right now,
darling. There you go, one for you.

46:02.999 --> 46:05.092
So, I've been to California. Have you?

46:05.235 --> 46:08.727
Really? I haven't been to California,
but I hear it's really, really cool.

46:08.839 --> 46:11.205
-Yeah.
-I've always wanted to go there.

46:11.308 --> 46:12.570
It's really hot in the summer.

46:12.676 --> 46:17.807
Like, I was there in short-sleeve shirts
and shorts all the time. It was so hot.

46:17.948 --> 46:19.813
<i>-That is so cool.
-And it was so... Yeah.</i>

47:18.508 --> 47:19.668
Hey.

47:21.678 --> 47:23.043
Hey, Jerry!

47:25.015 --> 47:26.141
Yeah?

47:26.549 --> 47:28.210
I used to run with Brian every...

47:28.351 --> 47:31.218
I used to run with Brian every morning.

47:33.556 --> 47:36.354
So you want to go for a run?

47:40.096 --> 47:43.156
I mean, I'm smoking, Howard.

47:46.069 --> 47:47.468
I'll wait.

47:47.570 --> 47:51.165
Howard, I haven't ran
since junior high school.

47:51.274 --> 47:52.969
We'll just, you know,
go for however long.

47:53.076 --> 47:55.340
You know,
down to the driveway, whatever.

47:55.445 --> 47:57.640
We'll just go, you know?

47:57.781 --> 48:01.080
-I don't know if I can do it.
-We'll just go slow.

48:05.255 --> 48:09.089
That's it. That's it. Can't do it.

48:09.259 --> 48:10.419
Okay.

48:25.475 --> 48:27.238
This was our route.

48:30.480 --> 48:33.108
Thought about changing it afterward,

48:36.052 --> 48:38.179
but this is our route.

48:44.761 --> 48:48.219
Audrey, I don't think
she's facing reality, man.

48:50.934 --> 48:53.425
Is she gonna have to get a job?

48:53.570 --> 48:55.128
Who told you that?

48:55.271 --> 48:59.230
No. Brian was a great developer.

48:59.342 --> 49:02.106
He really thought outside the box,
you know? Great at rehabbing space.

49:02.245 --> 49:05.578
Found opportunities
where nobody else could. Was just...

49:05.682 --> 49:08.082
Their house? Paid off long ago.

49:08.651 --> 49:12.485
No, Audrey'll never have to worry
about money.

49:19.129 --> 49:21.256
-Morning.
-Hey.

49:21.364 --> 49:23.958
-Can I have some water?
-Yeah.

49:25.101 --> 49:26.591
Thank you.

49:40.116 --> 49:41.276
So...

49:52.195 --> 49:53.685
Why am I here?

50:07.677 --> 50:09.474
I don't really know.

50:20.557 --> 50:23.287
You know, it should've been you, Jerry.

50:29.232 --> 50:30.961
Why wasn't it you?

50:59.562 --> 51:02.588
-Sonics suck.
-You suck.

51:02.732 --> 51:04.723
It's a rebuilding year.

51:06.136 --> 51:07.603
What?

51:07.737 --> 51:09.261
"Rebuilding year?"

51:09.405 --> 51:11.100
-You're nine.
-Ten.

51:11.241 --> 51:12.674
And I'd take you down
on the court anytime.

51:12.775 --> 51:14.834
Oh, yeah? Go ahead.

51:18.615 --> 51:22.210
One more time, one more time,
one more time. Shoot it. Shoot it.

51:24.721 --> 51:26.052
Check.

51:27.557 --> 51:29.115
Come on, check.

51:30.093 --> 51:33.187
Do you ever feel
like you're inside of a movie?

51:33.596 --> 51:36.258
Do I ever feel like I'm inside a movie?

51:36.666 --> 51:37.758
No.

51:39.936 --> 51:41.597
It's a sad movie.

51:47.577 --> 51:49.977
You know, it'll change, Harp.

51:53.650 --> 51:54.981
I promise.

51:58.354 --> 52:00.652
Promise. Give me a high-five.

52:03.026 --> 52:04.152
Okay.

52:05.094 --> 52:06.755
The hook, the hook!
You gotta do the hook.

52:06.863 --> 52:09.127
Do the hook. Do the hook.

52:52.742 --> 52:54.710
And I'm...

52:56.312 --> 53:00.772
I'm wondering if maybe you might
be able to help me do something.

53:01.985 --> 53:03.111
Sure.

53:05.421 --> 53:06.718
Sleep.

53:08.558 --> 53:10.492
-I need to sleep.
-Sure.

53:24.040 --> 53:26.406
Okay, leave your shoes out here.

53:31.114 --> 53:33.514
And shut the door.

53:39.555 --> 53:40.681
Okay.

53:41.357 --> 53:42.585
Come on.

53:44.127 --> 53:46.493
-Okay.
-I need to sleep.

53:49.565 --> 53:52.898
-I don't know about this.
-No, trust me.

53:53.036 --> 53:55.698
This used to work better than Ambien.

53:57.440 --> 53:58.600
Okay.

53:59.742 --> 54:05.203
Bring this knee up, like that. Higher.
Yeah, that's it.

54:08.618 --> 54:10.381
Turn off the light.

54:14.957 --> 54:18.518
Okay, now... Now take your hand

54:21.497 --> 54:24.364
and pull down on the earlobe.

54:25.501 --> 54:29.130
Just pull down. Yeah, just like that.

54:30.340 --> 54:34.140
Yeah, but do it faster. Harder.

54:36.579 --> 54:37.603
Yeah.

54:37.747 --> 54:39.715
-Like that?
-That's it.

54:41.117 --> 54:42.948
Just keep doing that.

54:54.130 --> 54:56.792
I'm still awake. You gotta keep going.

54:59.635 --> 55:02.399
-Keep going, keep going.
-Okay, okay, okay.

55:02.505 --> 55:03.904
Keep going.

56:00.696 --> 56:04.029
Just for today,
my thoughts will be on my recovery.

56:04.167 --> 56:07.568
Living and enjoying life
without the use of drugs.

56:07.703 --> 56:11.002
Just for today,
I will have faith in someone in N.A.

56:11.107 --> 56:14.702
Who believes in me
and wants to help me in my recovery.

56:14.844 --> 56:16.539
Just for today, through N.A.,

56:16.679 --> 56:19.910
I will try to get
a better perspective on my life.

56:20.049 --> 56:22.244
Just for today, I will be unafraid.

56:22.385 --> 56:25.218
My thoughts will be
on my new associations,

56:25.354 --> 56:27.083
people who are not using

56:27.223 --> 56:29.350
and who have found a new way of life.

56:29.459 --> 56:33.088
So long as I follow that way,
I have nothing to fear.

56:34.797 --> 56:37.561
Is there anyone else
that'd like to share?

56:38.734 --> 56:40.201
-Okay.
-Yeah?

56:41.737 --> 56:43.932
Hi, my name is Jerry and I'm an addict.

56:44.073 --> 56:45.438
-Hi, Jerry.
-Hi, Jerry.

56:45.575 --> 56:47.770
I've been clean for 21 days.

56:48.945 --> 56:52.039
I'm here because my friend died.

56:52.148 --> 56:53.843
He wasn't a user.

56:54.951 --> 56:56.680
I knew him since second grade,

56:56.786 --> 57:00.586
and he was the only person
who never, ever gave up on me.

57:00.723 --> 57:04.250
He died a hero in this fucked-up,
tragic way.

57:07.497 --> 57:09.021
It killed me.

57:10.399 --> 57:11.957
It really did.

57:21.644 --> 57:23.544
-Jerry?
-Yeah?

57:23.646 --> 57:25.113
-Hey.
-Kelly.

57:27.083 --> 57:28.744
I liked your share tonight.

57:28.851 --> 57:31.979
Good. I like compliments. Thank you.

57:32.121 --> 57:34.988
-So 21 days, huh?
-Yeah.

57:35.124 --> 57:38.218
-Bouncing off the bottom.
-That's right, yeah.

57:41.464 --> 57:44.627
You should stay till the Serenity Prayer.

57:44.767 --> 57:46.064
-Excuse me?
-Well, last week you left

57:46.168 --> 57:49.899
before the Serenity Prayer,
and it's disrespectful to leave before it.

57:50.006 --> 57:51.837
Disrespectful to who?

57:53.442 --> 57:55.103
To your recovery.

57:56.879 --> 57:59.404
Well, my recovery thanks you.

58:06.122 --> 58:08.784
-Are you married?
-No.

58:11.494 --> 58:13.621
Do you have children?

58:13.729 --> 58:15.754
Do I have children? Two.

58:16.165 --> 58:19.293
A six-year-old son
and a 10-year-old daughter.

58:21.637 --> 58:25.801
Well, I should probably go,

58:25.908 --> 58:29.036
but I'll see you next week.

58:29.178 --> 58:30.304
Yeah.

58:31.814 --> 58:33.145
Buckle up!

58:41.390 --> 58:43.790
-Hey. Hi.
-Hi. Hey.

58:45.194 --> 58:48.220
You hungry? You want me
to make you a sandwich or...

58:48.364 --> 58:52.164
No, no, I'm fine.
You think I could use the computer?

58:53.536 --> 58:55.299
Yeah. Sure.

58:55.404 --> 58:58.202
Howard wants me
to look into something.

58:58.341 --> 59:00.707
Okay. Come on, I'll show you.

59:04.513 --> 59:06.003
It's in there.

01:00:00.734 --> 01:00:05.034
I know I should...
I think I need to clean it out or...

01:00:50.350 --> 01:00:52.614
Those shoes are looking good!

01:01:01.227 --> 01:01:04.287
So, how does a lawyer
become a heroin addict?

01:01:07.567 --> 01:01:09.626
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:01:09.736 --> 01:01:13.968
Well, you start by doing coke, and then
you move on to a little crystal meth,

01:01:14.073 --> 01:01:18.032
you get paranoid, then you find heroin,
and after that...

01:01:20.847 --> 01:01:23.213
But you were a good lawyer, right?

01:01:26.586 --> 01:01:28.554
Who cares? Look at me.

01:01:31.758 --> 01:01:33.453
Come work for me.

01:01:35.428 --> 01:01:37.828
I don't know the first thing
about the mortgage business, Howard.

01:01:37.931 --> 01:01:40.399
You know what a house is, right?

01:01:40.533 --> 01:01:43.502
That's a good interview. You got the job.

01:01:49.676 --> 01:01:51.075
Here you go.

01:01:52.111 --> 01:01:53.476
Thank you.

01:01:55.014 --> 01:01:58.381
-And here's the living room.
-Yeah.

01:01:58.518 --> 01:02:02.648
As you can see, Doris gets her
decorating tips from Uday Hussein.

01:02:03.690 --> 01:02:06.659
She's gonna get all this, you know,
the house and everything.

01:02:06.759 --> 01:02:09.227
-So you're gonna go for it?
-Yeah.

01:02:10.730 --> 01:02:13.995
But I'm not good at facing my fears.

01:02:15.902 --> 01:02:17.995
I'm not strong like you.

01:02:19.706 --> 01:02:21.230
Strong like me?

01:02:24.777 --> 01:02:27.678
Look, you're gonna have
to take this test,

01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:29.611
the Washington State
mortgage brokers' exam,

01:02:29.749 --> 01:02:32.912
but don't freak out.
I'll coach you through it.

01:02:38.091 --> 01:02:39.786
-You sure?
-Yeah.

01:02:41.728 --> 01:02:42.854
Good.

01:04:12.352 --> 01:04:15.014
Hey. I brought your laundry.

01:04:16.889 --> 01:04:18.618
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:22.857
You look good.

01:04:22.996 --> 01:04:26.796
I mean, a lot better than you did
when you got here.

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:31.058
Thank you. Thirty-nine days.

01:04:39.212 --> 01:04:41.146
What's heroin like?

01:04:45.852 --> 01:04:49.413
You ever heard that expression,
"Being kissed by God"?

01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:56.021
Well, that's just at first.

01:05:26.059 --> 01:05:28.425
All you do is you chase it.

01:05:29.562 --> 01:05:33.089
You chase that initial feeling
when you can never get it back.

01:05:33.232 --> 01:05:36.531
You can get the escape
when you do get high,

01:05:36.636 --> 01:05:39.264
but never like the first few times.

01:05:40.807 --> 01:05:42.604
I wanna escape.

01:05:44.977 --> 01:05:46.137
Yeah.

01:05:47.313 --> 01:05:51.374
I wanna know
what it feels like to escape.

01:05:51.484 --> 01:05:53.247
No, you wouldn't.

01:05:53.986 --> 01:05:55.476
Yes, I would.

01:05:57.990 --> 01:06:02.450
And I would chase that feeling all day.

01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:07.326
I would chase it
until I couldn't chase it anymore.

01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:08.831
-No, you wouldn't.
-Yes, I would chase it.

01:06:08.968 --> 01:06:10.333
No, you wouldn't.

01:06:11.938 --> 01:06:13.769
You're too strong.

01:06:15.374 --> 01:06:16.773
Too engaged.

01:06:44.203 --> 01:06:45.534
I'm sorry.

01:06:51.978 --> 01:06:53.673
Sorry about that.

01:06:56.415 --> 01:06:57.541
Yeah.

01:07:02.588 --> 01:07:03.987
I'm sorry.

01:07:15.501 --> 01:07:16.627
Oh, you...

01:07:21.207 --> 01:07:22.469
Let's play, sucker!

01:07:22.575 --> 01:07:24.805
Don't let my head get wet.

01:07:24.911 --> 01:07:28.347
-You don't let your head under water?
-No.

01:07:28.447 --> 01:07:30.915
Can you put your chin under water?

01:07:31.784 --> 01:07:33.081
Show me.

01:07:37.757 --> 01:07:39.588
How about this ear?

01:07:42.862 --> 01:07:44.921
-And the other ear?
-Yeah.

01:07:46.032 --> 01:07:48.091
And the top of your head?

01:07:51.571 --> 01:07:53.937
There, you just put your head
under water.

01:07:55.441 --> 01:07:59.434
Your chin, the top of your head,
both of your ears.

01:08:00.213 --> 01:08:02.943
That's everything, man.
How do you feel?

01:08:04.584 --> 01:08:05.846
I don't know.

01:08:05.952 --> 01:08:09.046
Well, why don't you put it under
and tell me?

01:08:09.155 --> 01:08:11.248
You've already done it.

01:08:11.390 --> 01:08:13.950
It's easy to do something
you've already done, man.

01:08:14.093 --> 01:08:16.720
-Wanna do it fast?
-Yeah.

01:08:16.828 --> 01:08:18.456
On three?

01:08:18.598 --> 01:08:22.966
One, two, three!

01:08:41.153 --> 01:08:42.984
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:08:43.122 --> 01:08:44.612
Everything okay?

01:08:44.756 --> 01:08:47.089
-Yeah. Can I...
-Yeah, come in. Yeah.

01:08:53.432 --> 01:08:54.763
Sit down.

01:09:00.439 --> 01:09:01.997
Sit down. Yeah.

01:09:05.778 --> 01:09:08.747
What you did today broke my heart.

01:09:11.450 --> 01:09:13.008
What'd I do?

01:09:13.152 --> 01:09:16.178
You got Dory
to put his head under the water.

01:09:18.491 --> 01:09:21.585
-Just a cute trick, you know.
-He's six.

01:09:21.694 --> 01:09:24.492
Harper put hers under
when she was only three.

01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:27.622
It was something
that Brian tried and tried

01:09:27.733 --> 01:09:30.133
to get Dory to do, but he couldn't.

01:09:30.236 --> 01:09:34.604
And that victory today
of getting Dory's head to go under

01:09:34.707 --> 01:09:37.175
was not supposed to be yours.

01:09:39.011 --> 01:09:41.877
It wasn't meant for you
to have that moment.

01:09:42.014 --> 01:09:46.212
And for me, watching you was like this...

01:09:48.654 --> 01:09:49.643
This...

01:09:51.357 --> 01:09:52.721
I'm sorry.

01:10:22.355 --> 01:10:24.380
Harper's missing.

01:10:24.523 --> 01:10:25.888
The principal just called.

01:10:26.025 --> 01:10:29.483
She's not in school now
and she wasn't there yesterday, either.

01:10:29.595 --> 01:10:33.656
She's been missing school for two days,
but she was here last night.

01:10:33.766 --> 01:10:36.701
I'm freaking out, Jerry.
She's not answering her cell phone.

01:10:36.802 --> 01:10:39.236
I saw her get on the school bus
this morning, okay?

01:10:39.372 --> 01:10:43.866
Well, you stay here in case she comes
back because I'm going to the school.

01:10:43.976 --> 01:10:45.841
<i>...life without you.</i>

01:10:48.214 --> 01:10:49.943
<i>And you know I'm not afraid to die.</i>

01:10:50.549 --> 01:10:52.278
<i>That's between you
and yourself, Norma.</i>

01:10:52.418 --> 01:10:55.012
<i>You think I made that up
about the gun, don't you?</i>

01:10:56.322 --> 01:10:57.619
Harper!

01:11:01.961 --> 01:11:05.226
Call your mommy right now
and tell her you're fine.

01:11:08.067 --> 01:11:10.365
Yeah, it's almost over.

01:11:11.237 --> 01:11:14.866
Call her right now!
Right now, young girl!

01:11:22.281 --> 01:11:24.715
How'd you know where to find me?

01:11:27.586 --> 01:11:29.247
Your dad told me.

01:11:45.938 --> 01:11:47.269
You know,

01:11:48.207 --> 01:11:51.938
you could marry my mom
and then she'd be happy again,

01:11:52.044 --> 01:11:54.274
and we could be a family.

01:11:55.881 --> 01:11:57.746
That could never happen, Harp.

01:11:57.850 --> 01:11:59.317
Why not?

01:11:59.452 --> 01:12:04.014
Because that would make it so
my best friend never existed.

01:12:04.156 --> 01:12:05.316
But...

01:12:06.725 --> 01:12:08.192
He did exist.

01:12:11.897 --> 01:12:13.330
I guess that's why.

01:12:13.466 --> 01:12:17.869
And it doesn't matter because I could
never fill his shoes, you know?

01:12:22.308 --> 01:12:24.538
You know what?
I passed the test, though.

01:12:24.677 --> 01:12:26.167
-Really?
-Yep.

01:12:26.312 --> 01:12:28.371
-Good job.
-Thank you.

01:12:33.052 --> 01:12:34.952
Well, go ahead and tell her.

01:12:35.054 --> 01:12:36.521
You tell her.

01:12:36.689 --> 01:12:40.125
Well, there is a week every year

01:12:41.193 --> 01:12:44.890
that the Park Theater plays a different
black-and-white movie every day,

01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:48.966
and Brian used to take off work
and pull Harper out of school,

01:12:49.068 --> 01:12:50.365
and they'd both play hooky together

01:12:50.503 --> 01:12:52.903
and see one of these
black-and-white movies,

01:12:53.038 --> 01:12:56.405
so that's where
I found baby Hitchcock over here.

01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:10.020
How'd you know about the movies?

01:13:11.123 --> 01:13:12.715
Brian told me.

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:17.887
So how the fuck did you know about it
and I didn't?

01:13:19.798 --> 01:13:21.231
I don't know.

01:13:23.536 --> 01:13:27.529
Maybe he knew if you did,
you wouldn't let him do it again.

01:13:29.875 --> 01:13:32.503
Just don't take it out on her, okay?

01:13:33.946 --> 01:13:35.743
It's not her fault.

01:13:45.124 --> 01:13:46.557
What's wrong?

01:13:47.426 --> 01:13:49.519
This isn't working, Jerry.

01:13:50.796 --> 01:13:53.264
Those are my kids,

01:13:53.399 --> 01:13:56.300
and I don't need you or anybody else
telling me how to raise them.

01:13:56.435 --> 01:13:58.096
I know that.

01:13:58.237 --> 01:14:01.297
You need to get your stuff
and you need to go.

01:14:03.175 --> 01:14:04.301
Go.

01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:09.145
Audrey.

01:14:11.784 --> 01:14:13.046
Audrey.

01:14:14.453 --> 01:14:15.647
Audrey.

01:14:17.456 --> 01:14:18.480
Audrey.

01:14:18.624 --> 01:14:20.751
Audrey, Audrey, stop.

01:14:24.697 --> 01:14:26.255
This is unfair.

01:14:26.365 --> 01:14:29.163
Not to me, to Harper and Dory.

01:14:31.804 --> 01:14:34.671
Yeah, you're being selfish.

01:14:36.108 --> 01:14:37.405
Fuck you!

01:14:44.216 --> 01:14:45.683
-Thank you, Michael.
-Thank you, Michael.

01:14:45.818 --> 01:14:47.752
Anyone else? Okay, who's next?

01:14:48.954 --> 01:14:50.012
Kelly.

01:14:50.155 --> 01:14:52.282
Hi, my name's Kelly and I'm an addict.

01:14:52.391 --> 01:14:54.120
-Hi, Kelly.
-Hi, Kelly.

01:14:54.226 --> 01:14:57.161
So I'm really mad today and frustrated

01:14:57.296 --> 01:15:00.322
because there's this woman
at the convalescent home I work at,

01:15:00.466 --> 01:15:03.765
her name's Catherine.
She's 96 years old.

01:15:03.869 --> 01:15:07.805
She's always been this really upbeat,
high-energy, optimistic...

01:15:07.906 --> 01:15:12.104
Big smile all the time, and she was
recently diagnosed with cancer.

01:15:12.211 --> 01:15:15.476
But it's the kind that spreads slowly,
you know, it takes about 20 years.

01:15:15.581 --> 01:15:18.209
And I didn't want them to tell her.
You know, what's the point, right?

01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:22.878
She's gonna die of old age.
She's not gonna die of cancer.

01:15:23.022 --> 01:15:24.148
They fucking told her!

01:15:24.256 --> 01:15:27.225
And now she knows,
she's in her bed all day,

01:15:27.359 --> 01:15:29.793
she sleeps, she cries. It's...

01:15:30.663 --> 01:15:33.799
I just...
I don't think that they should've told her.

01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:36.731
I'll be back.

01:15:36.869 --> 01:15:38.803
-Thanks, Kelly.
-Thanks, Kelly.

01:15:38.904 --> 01:15:42.567
Now, for those who wish,
please let's join in the Serenity Prayer.

01:15:53.519 --> 01:15:59.480
God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,

01:15:59.591 --> 01:16:03.083
the courage to change the things I can,

01:16:03.228 --> 01:16:05.526
and the wisdom to know the difference.

01:16:35.761 --> 01:16:38.628
Are you gonna sell those to buy drugs?

01:16:38.764 --> 01:16:40.288
Excuse me?

01:16:40.432 --> 01:16:42.957
Are you gonna sell it to buy drugs?

01:16:44.403 --> 01:16:46.132
Why aren't you in bed?

01:16:46.905 --> 01:16:48.634
I had a nightmare.

01:16:50.476 --> 01:16:52.103
Well, me, too.

01:16:54.146 --> 01:16:57.411
Don't steal those. Put them back.
It's bad.

01:16:59.651 --> 01:17:01.118
Put them back.

01:17:03.922 --> 01:17:05.389
Put them back.

01:17:05.491 --> 01:17:06.617
Okay.

01:17:06.759 --> 01:17:08.818
-It's not good.
-Okay.

01:17:09.995 --> 01:17:11.155
Okay.

01:17:36.188 --> 01:17:39.521
So what's your nightmare about?

01:17:44.163 --> 01:17:45.528
I woke up,

01:17:46.698 --> 01:17:48.825
went into my mom's bedroom.

01:17:49.234 --> 01:17:51.634
She wasn't there. She was gone.

01:17:53.071 --> 01:17:55.938
I came down here
to check where she was.

01:17:57.543 --> 01:17:59.101
Then I woke up.

01:18:06.485 --> 01:18:10.182
You know, the good thing is that it's...
It's just a dream.

01:18:10.756 --> 01:18:12.314
It's not real.

01:18:15.227 --> 01:18:18.663
She usually sits with me
until I fall back asleep.

01:18:25.904 --> 01:18:30.500
"I look at each game, each day,
as a new chance."

01:18:49.261 --> 01:18:52.856
Jerry! Let's play, sucker!

01:19:02.975 --> 01:19:06.411
Jerry's gone! He's moved out!

01:19:06.812 --> 01:19:09.610
He's gonna go do drugs again.

01:19:09.748 --> 01:19:13.115
He's not gonna go do drugs, honey.
Why would you think that?

01:19:13.252 --> 01:19:14.412
Is it because of me?

01:19:14.553 --> 01:19:17.113
Because I skipped school
to go see those old movies?

01:19:17.256 --> 01:19:19.884
I promise, I promise,
I'll never do it again!

01:19:19.992 --> 01:19:21.789
Just let Jerry come back!

01:19:21.927 --> 01:19:26.455
Honey, nothing you did
made Jerry leave, okay?

01:19:27.499 --> 01:19:31.094
He's gonna be back, you'll see.
And he's gonna be fine.

01:19:31.236 --> 01:19:32.965
He's a big guy.

01:19:33.105 --> 01:19:36.597
Trust me on this one.
Come on, give me the ball.

01:19:36.742 --> 01:19:39.404
Does that mean Jerry's gonna die now?

01:19:41.079 --> 01:19:44.310
Congratulations on two years
of being clean.

01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:49.314
Thank you.

01:19:52.357 --> 01:19:54.416
My name is Frances and I'm an addict.

01:19:54.526 --> 01:19:55.993
Hi, Frances.

01:19:57.162 --> 01:20:00.256
Coming here for two years now

01:20:00.365 --> 01:20:03.334
has made me believe
that this is possible.

01:20:06.872 --> 01:20:11.138
My mother gave me this bear
when I was five years old,

01:20:11.276 --> 01:20:14.643
and I plan to pass this bear
on to my daughter when she's five.

01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:16.941
You're gonna make it, girl.

01:20:17.049 --> 01:20:18.448
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:20:25.891 --> 01:20:27.449
Jerry?

01:20:27.559 --> 01:20:28.821
<i>Who is this?</i>

01:20:30.696 --> 01:20:32.163
Who's this?

01:20:32.297 --> 01:20:33.958
My name's Kelly.

01:20:36.501 --> 01:20:38.526
Is this where Jerry lives?

01:20:38.670 --> 01:20:40.262
<i>-Yeah.
-Is he there?</i>

01:20:40.372 --> 01:20:42.806
'Cause he wasn't at the N.A. Meeting.

01:20:42.908 --> 01:20:43.966
<i>It was Fran's birthday,</i>

01:20:44.076 --> 01:20:46.340
and this wasn't a meeting
that he would've missed.

01:20:46.478 --> 01:20:48.309
<i>What does that mean?</i>

01:20:50.148 --> 01:20:51.809
<i>He's relapsed.</i>

01:20:56.254 --> 01:20:59.985
<i>Do you have any idea
where he might be?</i>

01:21:00.092 --> 01:21:02.219
<i>You don't wanna go there.</i>

01:21:39.698 --> 01:21:41.222
Hey, baby!

01:22:01.486 --> 01:22:02.612
Jerry?

01:22:06.758 --> 01:22:07.884
Jerry?

01:22:08.927 --> 01:22:12.522
Jerry! Jerry! It's Audrey.

01:22:13.765 --> 01:22:17.201
-Hi, Audrey.
-It's Audrey. Get up.

01:22:17.302 --> 01:22:22.763
I'm taking you home.
Come on! Get up! Get up!

01:22:27.746 --> 01:22:28.974
Come on.

01:22:31.349 --> 01:22:32.611
Come on.

01:22:42.828 --> 01:22:44.625
You see what's left?

01:22:46.932 --> 01:22:48.456
Shut up, Jerry.

01:22:51.503 --> 01:22:52.970
What can I get for you, Jerry,

01:22:53.105 --> 01:22:56.438
right now,
that's gonna help you feel better?

01:22:56.541 --> 01:22:57.906
Chocolate.

01:22:58.510 --> 01:22:59.841
Chocolate.

01:23:02.314 --> 01:23:04.976
Come on. Jerry.

01:23:05.117 --> 01:23:07.813
It's fucked up. It's fucked up.

01:23:07.953 --> 01:23:12.754
-It's fucked up.
-Sit down, Jerry. Sit down. Yeah.

01:23:12.858 --> 01:23:14.155
Jerry?

01:23:14.292 --> 01:23:15.850
What else do you need?

01:23:15.994 --> 01:23:19.862
You know what?
I would like some ice cream, please.

01:23:19.998 --> 01:23:22.466
Okay, I'll get you some ice cream,

01:23:22.567 --> 01:23:26.128
but for right now, Neal is gonna
stay here with you, okay?

01:23:27.472 --> 01:23:28.461
Okay?

01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:36.814
-Hi, Neal.
-Hey, Jerry.

01:23:38.316 --> 01:23:41.419
Looks like we're gonna be roommates
for a while, all right?

01:23:41.419 --> 01:23:42.113
Looks like we're gonna be roommates
for a while, all right?

01:23:42.988 --> 01:23:46.480
Fine with me, but don't...

01:23:50.996 --> 01:23:52.361
Hey, Jerry?

01:23:56.535 --> 01:24:01.905
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:03.530
Too much sleep.

01:24:05.443 --> 01:24:08.207
Well, we're gonna get you cleaned up.

01:24:09.414 --> 01:24:10.904
Get you out of those clothes.

01:24:11.049 --> 01:24:15.076
I hate it, man. I hate it.

01:24:16.955 --> 01:24:19.822
Oopsie-daisy.
Okay, you got any more drugs on you?

01:24:19.925 --> 01:24:21.916
I don't. Oh, no.

01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:23.550
Any needles?

01:24:26.264 --> 01:24:28.357
Okay, get that off.

01:24:31.403 --> 01:24:32.927
We're gonna put that...

01:24:33.205 --> 01:24:34.832
Hey! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:37.238
Hey, you just got here.
Go ahead, sit down.

01:25:06.338 --> 01:25:07.896
Who's with him?

01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:11.809
My brother.
Thanks for telling me about him.

01:25:15.614 --> 01:25:17.878
Are you his girlfriend?

01:25:17.983 --> 01:25:19.883
No. No.

01:25:21.586 --> 01:25:22.575
He

01:25:24.489 --> 01:25:26.957
was my husband's best friend.

01:25:29.294 --> 01:25:31.592
The one who was shot?

01:25:40.872 --> 01:25:43.170
Was he the love of your life?

01:25:49.481 --> 01:25:51.915
I lost the love of my life, too.

01:25:54.352 --> 01:25:55.944
To an overdose.

01:25:57.455 --> 01:25:59.753
But it's what got me clean.

01:25:59.858 --> 01:26:02.759
You know, they say
that every time a user dies,

01:26:02.861 --> 01:26:04.795
there's one
that gets clean because of it.

01:26:06.298 --> 01:26:08.095
How long ago?

01:26:08.199 --> 01:26:10.599
2,653 days.

01:26:14.406 --> 01:26:16.704
Does it get better?

01:26:16.841 --> 01:26:18.775
It gets different.

01:26:18.877 --> 01:26:20.640
I have a new life,

01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:25.309
so now I can have a new love of my life.

01:26:29.087 --> 01:26:32.523
Well, I don't know anything
about addiction, Kelly,

01:26:32.657 --> 01:26:34.887
so would you like to help me?

01:26:36.928 --> 01:26:40.295
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Okay!

01:26:40.699 --> 01:26:43.065
Hey, hey, hey.

01:26:43.201 --> 01:26:45.328
Come on, come on, come on.

01:26:48.340 --> 01:26:51.571
Come on. Come on, come on.

01:26:51.710 --> 01:26:53.905
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:26:54.045 --> 01:26:55.478
You gotta breathe.
You gotta breathe, baby.

01:26:55.580 --> 01:26:58.811
It's me, it's me. It's okay.
You gotta breathe.

01:27:28.780 --> 01:27:30.839
I got you.

01:27:32.217 --> 01:27:33.616
It's okay.

01:27:35.253 --> 01:27:37.687
Okay, okay. Nice and easy.

01:27:37.789 --> 01:27:39.552
I feel like shit.

01:27:41.426 --> 01:27:43.917
So the antacid you can give him now.

01:27:44.062 --> 01:27:47.725
The tea is to help him
keep down solids,

01:27:47.832 --> 01:27:51.199
and you want to give him
the antihistamine really only at night.

01:27:51.302 --> 01:27:54.396
-Okay. No, no, no, that's for Jerry.
-Nice.

01:27:54.506 --> 01:27:56.906
Do you want a little taste? Huh?

01:27:57.776 --> 01:27:59.539
When can I see him?

01:28:03.148 --> 01:28:06.379
Very soon, honey. Promise.

01:28:13.691 --> 01:28:15.215
All right. Come on, right here, man.

01:28:15.326 --> 01:28:17.988
Take this. Take this.
It's gonna help you out.

01:28:19.631 --> 01:28:22.725
All right, get it down, get it down.

01:28:22.834 --> 01:28:25.064
A little water. All right.

01:28:34.212 --> 01:28:35.577
I'm cold!

01:29:28.766 --> 01:29:31.132
Are you gonna die like my dad?

01:29:31.936 --> 01:29:33.130
Yeah.

01:29:35.340 --> 01:29:36.864
When?

01:29:37.008 --> 01:29:39.670
As soon as possible, I hope.

01:29:40.912 --> 01:29:42.903
You're kidding, right?

01:29:51.923 --> 01:29:54.585
I brought you some cookies and water.

01:29:55.527 --> 01:29:58.496
C-3PO and R2-D2.

01:29:58.596 --> 01:29:59.722
Yeah.

01:30:01.065 --> 01:30:04.034
3PO was a little stuck-up.

01:30:04.135 --> 01:30:05.227
Yeah.

01:30:05.370 --> 01:30:07.429
I like R2-D2 better.

01:30:09.574 --> 01:30:10.563
Excuse me.

01:30:12.810 --> 01:30:15.074
He seemed more accessible.

01:30:17.415 --> 01:30:18.677
Here.

01:30:38.303 --> 01:30:39.361
Here! Get back.

01:30:39.470 --> 01:30:40.596
Hey, Jerry.

01:30:42.307 --> 01:30:44.434
-Hi, Audrey.
-Ready, Emily?

01:30:44.576 --> 01:30:45.702
Come on in.

01:30:45.810 --> 01:30:48.142
I'm just... I'm smoking.

01:30:48.279 --> 01:30:51.146
Well, it's okay, you can smoke inside.

01:30:51.282 --> 01:30:52.476
Okay.

01:30:52.750 --> 01:30:55.617
So he does not pay, right?

01:30:56.588 --> 01:30:58.579
So, essentially, we are...

01:31:05.196 --> 01:31:06.754
-Hi, Diane.
-Hi!

01:31:06.864 --> 01:31:07.990
Hi.

01:31:10.001 --> 01:31:12.799
-How you doing?
-Feeling better.

01:31:14.939 --> 01:31:16.839
Good. You look better.

01:31:16.975 --> 01:31:18.272
Thanks.

01:31:22.547 --> 01:31:23.980
He's so wrong.

01:31:25.717 --> 01:31:26.911
What?

01:31:28.219 --> 01:31:31.780
"R2-D2 is more accessible?"

01:31:38.563 --> 01:31:41.157
So it wasn't a hallucination, huh?

01:31:41.299 --> 01:31:43.631
No. That was my son.

01:31:47.572 --> 01:31:50.837
He was so cute.
Brought me a cookie and water.

01:31:56.014 --> 01:31:57.777
Hold on, excuse me.

01:31:59.217 --> 01:32:01.378
Dory! What did your mother say?

01:32:01.519 --> 01:32:03.885
What did your mother say?
What did your mother say?

01:32:08.259 --> 01:32:10.659
You wanna sit and have some dinner?

01:32:10.762 --> 01:32:14.493
I think you should eat, you know?
Maybe you can keep it down.

01:32:14.599 --> 01:32:15.896
I'll try.

01:32:29.414 --> 01:32:31.143
See how he's spinning around like that?

01:32:31.249 --> 01:32:32.477
Brian used to do the same thing.

01:32:32.583 --> 01:32:35.074
Basketball games,
soccer games, any game.

01:32:35.219 --> 01:32:36.413
I know.

01:32:41.959 --> 01:32:43.824
I miss the silliness,

01:32:47.432 --> 01:32:48.763
the fun.

01:32:56.441 --> 01:33:01.174
I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel
happy again.

01:33:07.318 --> 01:33:10.219
Am I ever gonna feel beautiful?

01:33:10.321 --> 01:33:12.118
You are beautiful.

01:33:15.126 --> 01:33:17.253
No, I mean on the inside.

01:33:20.064 --> 01:33:23.261
You're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

01:33:34.345 --> 01:33:35.903
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:33:36.814 --> 01:33:38.611
What are you doing here?

01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:40.377
I invited her.

01:33:50.828 --> 01:33:51.954
-Howard?
-Yeah?

01:33:52.096 --> 01:33:54.087
Can we swim in the pool tomorrow?

01:33:56.300 --> 01:33:59.792
I'm sorry, Dory,
but I don't live there anymore.

01:33:59.937 --> 01:34:00.961
Why?

01:34:01.105 --> 01:34:06.236
Well, because my soon to be ex-wife is
gonna get the house.

01:34:07.545 --> 01:34:10.810
Honey, we'll find another place to swim.
Okay?

01:34:10.948 --> 01:34:12.438
What kind of music
did your husband like?

01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:14.814
Did he like classical music?

01:34:19.290 --> 01:34:20.416
Yeah.

01:34:21.559 --> 01:34:23.925
What did he drink after dinner?

01:34:25.396 --> 01:34:28.297
Coffee? Italian wine? Or nothing?

01:34:33.237 --> 01:34:37.196
Chocolate milk.
He loved chocolate milk.

01:34:41.245 --> 01:34:44.043
-What kind of toothpaste did he use?
-Crest.

01:34:46.818 --> 01:34:48.285
He... Crest.

01:34:51.022 --> 01:34:54.014
Come on, ask me a question, Kelly.

01:34:54.158 --> 01:34:57.321
Okay, what was his favorite movie?

01:34:58.396 --> 01:35:00.057
I can't remember.

01:35:00.531 --> 01:35:04.695
<i>He liked this really old boring one,
with the guy from Meet the Fockers.</i>

01:35:06.270 --> 01:35:07.567
<i>Godfather II.</i>

01:35:07.705 --> 01:35:09.366
-It was One, actually.
-Yeah.

01:35:09.507 --> 01:35:10.496
No, he liked Two.

01:35:10.608 --> 01:35:11.836
My dad shot a squirrel.

01:35:11.943 --> 01:35:13.672
-He did?
-Yeah.

01:35:13.778 --> 01:35:16.838
He killed it. He cried a lot.

01:35:18.416 --> 01:35:20.145
He was nine.

01:35:20.251 --> 01:35:22.742
-We had a fire.
-You did?

01:35:22.887 --> 01:35:24.912
Yeah.

01:35:25.056 --> 01:35:26.580
How did it happen?

01:35:26.724 --> 01:35:28.021
It was electrical.

01:35:28.125 --> 01:35:32.027
-The garage door opener went kaput.
-Oh, yeah.

01:35:35.132 --> 01:35:38.590
-Yeah.
-My dad wasn't upset, but my mom was.

01:35:41.239 --> 01:35:42.399
Yeah.

01:35:44.742 --> 01:35:50.578
We lost so many things, I mean,
baby clothes, our photo albums.

01:35:50.715 --> 01:35:51.704
My bike.

01:35:51.816 --> 01:35:56.776
Your bike, important papers,
everything, just...

01:35:58.389 --> 01:36:01.119
We lost a lot. And I remember, I...

01:36:04.795 --> 01:36:09.027
I went to him and I said, you know,
"How can you be so calm?"

01:36:10.067 --> 01:36:13.867
And he said, "Hey, you know,
those are just things, Audrey.

01:36:13.971 --> 01:36:16.735
"Those are just the stuff.
That's just stuff.

01:36:16.841 --> 01:36:19.036
"We still have each other."

01:36:44.101 --> 01:36:45.261
Hi.

01:36:48.139 --> 01:36:49.606
Are you okay?

01:36:53.644 --> 01:36:55.271
This is a list

01:36:59.150 --> 01:37:02.017
of all the things we lost in the fire.

01:37:11.028 --> 01:37:12.461
He's gone.

01:37:19.303 --> 01:37:20.702
He's gone.

01:38:18.429 --> 01:38:22.024
Jerry! Why? Why?

01:38:23.300 --> 01:38:28.932
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

01:38:37.114 --> 01:38:39.014
It's gonna be okay.

01:39:59.396 --> 01:40:00.624
Audrey?

01:40:00.731 --> 01:40:03.996
Yeah? I'm back here. In Dory's room.

01:40:05.870 --> 01:40:07.667
Harper told me you wanted to see me.

01:40:07.805 --> 01:40:11.798
Hey, come on. Sit down.

01:40:21.352 --> 01:40:25.118
So I spoke to Kelly.

01:40:27.725 --> 01:40:28.953
And...

01:40:30.694 --> 01:40:34.790
She said that this, you know...

01:40:34.899 --> 01:40:40.963
This facility, or rehab place
really worked for her.

01:40:43.274 --> 01:40:44.400
So...

01:40:47.511 --> 01:40:53.541
Now, I was kind of thinking
that maybe you should go and...

01:40:53.684 --> 01:40:58.553
Audrey, you've already done
enough for me.

01:41:00.191 --> 01:41:02.853
Right. Okay, but, look,
if you're gonna make this about money,

01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:04.689
then I'm gonna be pissed.

01:41:04.795 --> 01:41:06.660
Now, if you wanna make it
about something else,

01:41:06.764 --> 01:41:10.097
I mean, I don't know, whatever,
I'm gonna hate it,

01:41:10.601 --> 01:41:14.537
but, you know, I guess I can accept that.

01:41:31.155 --> 01:41:35.854
You know, Brian used to say something
to the kids all the time.

01:41:37.995 --> 01:41:39.860
"Accept the good."

01:41:44.902 --> 01:41:46.870
Accept the good, Jerry.

01:41:57.648 --> 01:41:59.707
Do they glow in the dark?

01:42:03.754 --> 01:42:06.882
Yeah. They're fluorescent.

01:42:23.173 --> 01:42:24.333
Okay.

01:42:27.378 --> 01:42:29.903
I'll go, but under one condition.

01:42:30.014 --> 01:42:32.847
When I come out, I'm gonna get a job,

01:42:32.983 --> 01:42:38.421
and I'm gonna pay you back, down
to the last penny, and you will take it.

01:42:43.027 --> 01:42:44.324
Promise?

01:43:00.644 --> 01:43:02.669
Hey, Harp.

01:43:02.813 --> 01:43:05.145
Hi, Jerry. Wanna play?

01:43:07.584 --> 01:43:10.382
-Can I talk to you for a second?
-Yeah.

01:43:15.526 --> 01:43:16.857
Okay, here it is.

01:43:18.562 --> 01:43:22.760
I'm gonna be leaving soon.
I'm gonna go to a sort of hospital.

01:43:25.002 --> 01:43:28.165
-For how long?
-Well, I don't know.

01:43:29.373 --> 01:43:33.867
But when I get out, I'm gonna have
my own place and you can come visit.

01:43:37.314 --> 01:43:40.374
You mean
you're not staying here anymore?

01:43:40.517 --> 01:43:41.677
No.

01:43:44.688 --> 01:43:46.212
Why the face?

01:43:47.925 --> 01:43:50.826
That's how it was always gonna be.

01:43:50.928 --> 01:43:54.625
No! You can't just come here
and pretend to be my dad and leave!

01:43:58.002 --> 01:44:02.200
Harper, I never pretended
to be your daddy.

01:44:13.951 --> 01:44:15.248
Where's your sister?

01:44:15.386 --> 01:44:18.412
She locked herself in her room.
She's mad.

01:44:19.623 --> 01:44:22.490
-Why? She's mad at you?
-No. You.

01:44:25.396 --> 01:44:26.727
She's mad at me, huh?

01:44:26.864 --> 01:44:28.889
She doesn't wanna talk to anyone.

01:44:29.033 --> 01:44:32.002
Okay, watch your hand. Scram.

01:44:44.748 --> 01:44:45.772
Jerry!

01:44:46.884 --> 01:44:48.613
Jerry. Man.

01:44:51.055 --> 01:44:53.455
I thought I was gonna miss you.

01:44:56.994 --> 01:44:59.929
-I'm proud of you, man.
-Thank you.

01:45:03.667 --> 01:45:05.794
I'm going back to my wife.

01:45:09.473 --> 01:45:11.941
I'm lonely as fuck in town, man.

01:45:14.111 --> 01:45:15.203
Okay.

01:45:17.481 --> 01:45:18.743
Howard?

01:45:20.918 --> 01:45:22.283
Thank you.

01:45:43.807 --> 01:45:44.899
Harper?

01:45:47.211 --> 01:45:50.647
I want to say goodbye.
Can you take a look at this note?

01:46:05.696 --> 01:46:07.095
I love you.

01:46:26.183 --> 01:46:27.343
Hey.

01:46:45.068 --> 01:46:48.299
Are you gonna be my friend
when you get better?

01:46:50.073 --> 01:46:52.200
I'm gonna be your friend forever.

01:46:52.342 --> 01:46:54.401
Like you were with my dad?

01:46:55.579 --> 01:46:56.705
You bet.

01:46:58.282 --> 01:47:00.375
Now give me a real kiss.

01:47:00.517 --> 01:47:01.882
Good. Okay.

01:47:21.471 --> 01:47:25.066
Wait! Wait!

01:47:30.047 --> 01:47:31.207
Wait!

01:47:32.716 --> 01:47:34.684
Wait! Jerry!

01:47:36.820 --> 01:47:38.117
Hey!

01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:33.568
Hi, my name is Jerry and I'm an addict.

01:48:33.677 --> 01:48:35.770
-Hi, Jerry.
-Hello, Jerry.

01:48:38.215 --> 01:48:41.946
I've been clean for 89 days.

01:48:42.052 --> 01:48:43.986
My mind is clearer,

01:48:48.492 --> 01:48:50.824
and I think it's getting better.

01:48:50.961 --> 01:48:53.521
Every day, a little bit.

01:48:53.664 --> 01:48:56.929
But I wanna talk about this dream
I keep having.

01:48:59.236 --> 01:49:02.763
It always starts
with me stealing silverware.

01:49:02.873 --> 01:49:06.866
<i>Then I go sell it to this guy</i>

01:49:07.010 --> 01:49:10.810
<i>who I used to know
who owned a catering service.</i>

01:49:12.816 --> 01:49:17.617
Then with the money, I go to this place
where I used to buy my drug of choice,

01:49:20.991 --> 01:49:24.051
and he's not around.

01:49:27.030 --> 01:49:29.498
So I go to other spots, right,

01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:35.663
but for some reason, no one is around.

01:49:38.275 --> 01:49:40.971
<i>All of Seattle is dry,</i>

01:49:41.078 --> 01:49:46.015
and then I get that feeling, the dread,

01:49:50.454 --> 01:49:52.149
and I panic.

01:49:56.927 --> 01:49:58.485
And I start running,

01:50:00.731 --> 01:50:03.825
<i>and it's raining, and it gets dark.</i>

01:50:05.869 --> 01:50:10.238
<i>And then I'm in my old apartment,
and I'm thrashing right through it,</i>

01:50:11.375 --> 01:50:14.572
<i>looking for something
I might have stashed away.</i>

01:50:18.115 --> 01:50:20.583
And I think I'm having a seizure.

01:50:23.887 --> 01:50:27.721
And then I find a balloon
hidden in my suitcase.

01:50:49.279 --> 01:50:50.871
So there I am

01:50:53.483 --> 01:50:55.917
with a bag of junk in one hand

01:50:56.953 --> 01:51:00.081
and the money for my next fix
in the other,

01:51:00.190 --> 01:51:03.921
and I feel at total, utter peace.

01:51:13.770 --> 01:51:15.260
And I wake up.

01:51:19.509 --> 01:51:21.238
<i>One day at a time.</i>

01:51:24.381 --> 01:51:26.110
<i>One day at a time.</i>

01:51:32.122 --> 01:51:33.817
One day at a time.

01:51:37.994 --> 01:51:39.757
<i>One day at a time.</i>

01:51:46.970 --> 01:51:48.335
Thank you.
