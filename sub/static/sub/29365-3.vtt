00:06.965 --> 00:09.175
Alright. It's actually
a pretty easy process.

00:09.259 --> 00:13.013
Right. We're gonna attach the semen straw
to the wand,

00:13.096 --> 00:16.349
then we're gonna insert this
into the cow at a 45-degree angle.

00:17.183 --> 00:20.311
Got it. We're gonna
put the junk in the trunk.

00:22.230 --> 00:24.649
Now this part gets a little tactical,

00:24.733 --> 00:26.109
so try to stay with me.

00:26.192 --> 00:27.402
Okay, I'm with you.

00:27.861 --> 00:28.695
Alright.

00:29.320 --> 00:32.407
You are gonna go shoulder deep
in that cow's ass

00:32.490 --> 00:33.700
and pull out an armful of shit.

00:36.453 --> 00:37.287
Okay, I'm out.

00:38.204 --> 00:40.206
Is this, like, a hazing thing
'cause I'm the new guy?

00:40.290 --> 00:42.667
'Cause back in Iraq,
everyone was supposed to do it,

00:42.751 --> 00:45.754
but when the lights came on,
I was the only one chugging camel urine.

00:47.422 --> 00:48.923
You know what? I'll do it.

00:49.632 --> 00:51.760
Just grab me some sperm
outta that thermos.

00:52.844 --> 00:55.305
Err... Wait. This is not coffee.

00:55.388 --> 00:56.306
[cows mooing]

00:56.431 --> 00:57.891
Colt, I think I might be pregnant.

00:59.726 --> 01:00.643
[cow moos angrily]

01:01.436 --> 01:02.729
What the fuck, man?

01:03.354 --> 01:04.981
I told you to latch the gate.

01:05.356 --> 01:06.399
I thought I did.

01:06.858 --> 01:08.777
Yeah. Well, obviously you didn't.

01:09.194 --> 01:11.196
That cow coulda kicked me in the face.

01:11.404 --> 01:14.032
This ranching don't work out,
that's my backup plan.

01:14.824 --> 01:16.910
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm still learning.

01:17.077 --> 01:20.205
I thought Farmville would prep me
for this but it just hasn't.

01:20.914 --> 01:23.625
Know what? This is gonna be quicker
if I do it myself.

01:24.042 --> 01:25.502
I was joking. I wanna help.

01:25.585 --> 01:27.170
I know, but I got a lotta shit to do,

01:27.253 --> 01:30.381
and I ain't got a lotta time.
Why don't you go ride some fence?

01:30.673 --> 01:32.759
Alright. I'll go ride fence.

01:35.220 --> 01:36.054
Err...

01:36.429 --> 01:37.388
Quick question.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.224
What is "riding fence"?

01:40.850 --> 01:41.768
[cow moos]

01:42.060 --> 01:43.311
You ride along the fence,

01:43.394 --> 01:45.939
makin' sure there's no holes
for the cows to get out.

01:46.022 --> 01:47.440
And don't fuck around either

01:47.524 --> 01:49.692
'cause I can see you on every part
of this ranch.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.320
Wait. How?

01:53.571 --> 01:56.282
I dunno. It's something
my dad used to say and I believed him.

01:56.366 --> 01:57.450

[Mary] Hey.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.022
What you doing here?

03:09.314 --> 03:11.608
I-- I want to apologize
for the other night.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.987
I was stressed but there was no reason
for me to yell at you like that.

03:16.321 --> 03:17.989
And I did take a pill
for a headache, but...

03:18.740 --> 03:20.450
That didn't work, so I took another one.

03:20.533 --> 03:22.702
And another one,
and 'fore you know it, I was at CVS,

03:22.785 --> 03:25.830
asking the pharmacist what they do
with pills that fall on the floor.

03:27.957 --> 03:30.627
Look, it's your life.
You can do whatever you want.

03:30.960 --> 03:34.088
No, you were right to call me out.

03:35.131 --> 03:35.965
Here.

03:38.593 --> 03:41.179
This is every pill that was in that house.

03:41.471 --> 03:44.224
Even the stuff we gave the dog
when there was lightning.

03:45.266 --> 03:46.893
Well, this is great.

03:47.393 --> 03:49.979
Except you said this before,
and then the next day

03:50.063 --> 03:52.565
you were so high
you thought a Filet-o-Fish sounded good.

03:52.857 --> 03:55.276
Yeah, I know. But this time is different.

03:56.027 --> 03:58.029
I went to an NA meeting this morning.

03:58.988 --> 03:59.822
Really?

04:01.407 --> 04:02.533
It's a big step.

04:03.284 --> 04:04.202
I'm proud of you.

04:04.786 --> 04:05.620
Thanks.

04:06.162 --> 04:07.372
Supposed to be anonymous.

04:07.455 --> 04:08.790
So, if we're driving around town,

04:08.873 --> 04:11.000
I'll just elbow you
and point out the junkies.

04:12.460 --> 04:13.836
-You wanna come in?
-Yeah.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.801
Oh. Maybe point out the relapsers,

04:19.884 --> 04:22.262
then I don't have to flush these,
we could sell them.

04:22.345 --> 04:23.179
[Mary laughs]

04:27.350 --> 04:28.893
There is one other thing.

04:29.143 --> 04:31.521
I... hate that I even have to ask,

04:31.604 --> 04:33.773
so don't worry about saying no
if you can't.

04:35.233 --> 04:36.609
Yeah, alright. Let's do it.

04:37.151 --> 04:39.237
How many orgasms would you like, milady?

04:41.406 --> 04:42.490
Well, three,

04:42.657 --> 04:45.702
but I was gonna ask for something
you can actually help with.

04:46.577 --> 04:47.412
Mm-hmm.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.580
Okay, so half of one?

04:52.333 --> 04:54.210
So, what do you need?

04:54.877 --> 04:57.505
Err... I'm way behind on my mortgage.

04:57.588 --> 05:00.758
If I don't make a payment by Friday,
the bank's gonna evict us.

05:00.925 --> 05:03.594
Apparently my last two checks
in the amount of "fuck you"

05:03.678 --> 05:04.595
did not go through.

05:06.264 --> 05:08.057
Well, I'd love to help, but...

05:08.141 --> 05:10.768
I gave most of my money
to Colt for the ranch.

05:11.644 --> 05:14.314
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I mean, I shouldn't have even asked.

05:14.397 --> 05:16.983
It's just my kids
and my grandkids live there.

05:17.317 --> 05:20.570
You know?
I've been applying for all kinds of jobs

05:20.653 --> 05:22.113
and nothing has come through.

05:23.072 --> 05:24.699
Anyway, it's not your problem.

05:26.451 --> 05:27.327
[Mary sighs]

05:27.452 --> 05:30.872
No, I can probably scrape together
a thousand bucks.

05:31.622 --> 05:32.874
Let me see what I can do.

05:33.583 --> 05:34.834
Thank you so much.

05:35.418 --> 05:36.461
And no pressure.

05:36.586 --> 05:39.172
I mean, if you can't do it...
We're totally good.

05:39.255 --> 05:41.424
Well, I don't want you guys
to be homeless.

05:42.342 --> 05:45.928
Although, with two grandkids,
you could really clean up at an off-ramp.

05:46.262 --> 05:47.096

05:58.441 --> 05:59.901
Should I get you a bottle, too?

05:59.984 --> 06:02.904
Oh! Shit. [scoffs]

06:03.946 --> 06:06.324
I know you're joking,
but I could use a Bud.

06:08.534 --> 06:10.578
I just made this for Peyton.

06:10.995 --> 06:13.289
I don't know what it is
about a tiny mirror,

06:13.581 --> 06:15.625
but, man, it is very slimming.

06:18.795 --> 06:20.463
This is pretty good craftsmanship.

06:20.546 --> 06:22.215
Yeah. Thanks.

06:22.799 --> 06:25.760
I'm glad she's finally got a toy
that's not made in China.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.974
I saw that Neumann's Hill bull's
back on my land.

06:32.642 --> 06:36.479
Yeah. He took care of five of my heifers,
headed back like nothing happened.

on a nice shirt.

What you gonna do
with the rest of your herd?

06:49.659 --> 06:51.702
Well, with the money Luke's throwing in,

06:52.203 --> 06:54.205
we're gonna
artificially inseminate them... Well,

06:54.288 --> 06:56.457
I am. He's useless.

06:56.541 --> 06:58.626
So, you taught him everything you know.

07:03.005 --> 07:05.633
Yeah, I got eight more to do by myself

07:06.259 --> 07:07.510
in the next two days.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.263
What if I was your ranch hand?

It's too minty.

[nose-blowing]

07:27.572 --> 07:28.406
Too minty!

07:30.158 --> 07:32.410
Look, I appreciate the offer,

07:32.493 --> 07:34.745
but ain't no way you're taking orders
from me.

07:34.829 --> 07:38.082
Hell, you can't even follow directions
on the back of a TV dinner.

07:40.543 --> 07:43.421
Look, I can either take the plastic off
or leave it on,

07:43.838 --> 07:46.799
but I'm not venting a hole
for the fucking cobbler.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.763
I promise I'll just be
an extra set of hands.

07:54.390 --> 07:56.142
Ain't you got your own ranch to run?

07:56.225 --> 07:58.936
Neumann's Hill's pretty much
taking care of everything.

07:59.353 --> 08:01.230
Last week, the only thing
they asked me to do

08:01.314 --> 08:03.774
was watch a video on sexual harassment.

08:06.694 --> 08:09.405
What do they think I'm gonna do
with the fucking cows?

-That's my Sephora coupon.

to Mrs. Colt Bennett.

No. Actually, she was cranky all day.

so I left her with my mom.

09:08.464 --> 09:12.760

get to see Peyton today?

This ain't working for me.

09:19.016 --> 09:19.850
Okay?

09:20.142 --> 09:22.728
First, you move into your parents' house.

09:22.812 --> 09:25.106
Then you move into a new apartment,
with your new job,

09:25.189 --> 09:26.983
and I... I never get an overnight.

09:27.066 --> 09:29.652
'Cause I'm still breastfeeding.
I'm not ready for that.

09:29.986 --> 09:32.738
Okay. Well,
I'm barely getting to see my daughter.

09:34.115 --> 09:35.366
Yeah. No, you're right.

09:35.866 --> 09:38.411
I promise we'll figure something out.
I'll make a schedule.

09:38.661 --> 09:39.495
[Colt] Okay.

09:40.037 --> 09:41.372
It's like when we had that...

09:41.622 --> 09:43.666
one copy of the Jeff Foxworthy CD.

09:43.749 --> 09:45.251
You know, we found a way to share it.

09:45.334 --> 09:47.169
In fact, we even came up
with our own joke.

09:47.253 --> 09:50.423
"You might be a redneck
if you're sharing a Jeff Foxworthy CD."

-Yes, I promise.

Good. I wanna show her this.

-Oh! Colt, this is so cute!
-Mm-hmm.

10:04.604 --> 10:05.563
Aw! Ooh...

10:05.771 --> 10:07.523
-Mama looks good.
-I know.

10:08.983 --> 10:10.526
It's like a photo shoot.

10:10.985 --> 10:11.819
Oh!

10:11.902 --> 10:12.737
Hold on!

10:12.820 --> 10:14.905
I'll get my nice shirt
and we'll do an Instagram story.

Hey. Where are you coming from?

10:24.123 --> 10:26.375
I just took a morning walk
to clear my head.

10:26.626 --> 10:27.793
It was so beautiful.

10:27.877 --> 10:30.546
Then a guy in a Prius
with a Coexist bumper sticker

10:30.630 --> 10:32.882
drove by and waved at me,
fucking ruin everything.

10:35.259 --> 10:37.261
Shouldn't you be out working with Colt?

than when you were my vet.

What is it today?

Another picture of you and me
photoshopped onto Starsky and Hutch?

I bet you feel like a real asshole now,
don't you?

11:10.961 --> 11:12.672
I was just in there the other day.

11:13.506 --> 11:14.924
Do you know how it happened?

11:15.341 --> 11:16.884
Yeah. Heart attack.

11:17.843 --> 11:19.136
Right in aisle three.

11:19.345 --> 11:21.138
Fell into a bucket of rakes.

11:21.597 --> 11:23.599
Rakes are on aisle four.

11:24.850 --> 11:27.478
Well, then he died on fucking aisle four!

11:30.690 --> 11:32.233
I can't believe he's gone.

11:33.859 --> 11:35.820
He and I went to high school together.

11:36.529 --> 11:37.363
You know,

11:37.905 --> 11:40.741
I think he moved those rakes
last summer to aisle five.

11:42.827 --> 11:44.578
Yeah, he was one of the good ones.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.624
Seem like everybody we know is dying.

11:49.667 --> 11:53.045
I'm like Iron Man
at the end of Infinity War.

11:54.046 --> 11:56.799
How in the hell
are they gonna beat Thanos?

11:59.468 --> 12:02.722
You know, Glenn was talking about
selling the feed store next year.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.474
He'd been saving his whole life

12:05.558 --> 12:07.893
to buy a cabin in Montana and retire.

12:08.811 --> 12:09.645
Jesus!

12:09.729 --> 12:11.731
Yeah. That's all he ever talked about.

12:12.481 --> 12:14.483
That and betting on the Broncos,

12:14.567 --> 12:17.361
which is probably why it took so long
to save for that cabin.

12:17.445 --> 12:18.404
[Joanne chuckles]

12:19.488 --> 12:21.949
Yeah, you can't wait on your dreams.

12:22.241 --> 12:24.618
Charlene and I just finished
our bucket list.

12:24.702 --> 12:27.288
We visited every state in the Union.

12:27.496 --> 12:30.416
You know, I've lived in Colorado
all my life, and I've never been skiing?

12:30.666 --> 12:34.295
The only good kind of skiing is the kind
where you stop and shoot things.

12:35.504 --> 12:37.089
Well, this winter, I'm going.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.091
I'm gonna get a new outfit.

12:39.383 --> 12:41.385
Sit by the fire and drink hot toddies.

12:42.219 --> 12:43.637
Wait a minute, fuck skiing.

12:43.721 --> 12:46.474
Maybe my bucket list is just looking good
and getting drunk.

12:46.557 --> 12:47.516
[all chuckle]

12:48.434 --> 12:49.727
How about you, Beau?

12:50.311 --> 12:52.646
What's your "cabin in Montana"?

12:53.481 --> 12:55.149
I never really thought about it.

12:56.817 --> 12:59.820
I mostly have things
I don't want to do before I die.

13:01.363 --> 13:04.492
I don't wanna experience anything
in IMAX.

13:05.159 --> 13:06.243
[cow moos]

13:07.328 --> 13:09.705
I don't want my water... sparkling.

13:12.124 --> 13:14.543
And I don't want to take Flonase.

13:16.712 --> 13:19.048
I don't know what that is,
but I don't want it.

13:21.425 --> 13:22.802
That's kinda depressing.

13:23.135 --> 13:26.222
Everybody ought to have something
they look forward to doing.

13:26.514 --> 13:29.058
Hey. Maybe we could rent an RV

13:29.141 --> 13:31.352
and take a road trip down to Oklahoma.

13:31.852 --> 13:34.230
Just thought of something else
I don't wanna do.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.739
-[Beau] Hey.
-You're late.

13:45.074 --> 13:45.908
[Beau] Yeah.

13:46.951 --> 13:49.495
I went to this bitching party last night.

13:50.412 --> 13:51.872
Got fucking hammered.

13:53.666 --> 13:57.586
I puked on my alarm clock.
Must've shorted it out.

13:59.630 --> 14:00.589
Sorry, dude.

14:03.259 --> 14:05.386
I believe that could actually
happen to someone.

14:06.053 --> 14:07.721
[chuckles] I appreciate your honesty.

14:09.181 --> 14:10.057
Where's Luke?

14:10.307 --> 14:12.393
I got him out disking up the field.

14:13.227 --> 14:16.146
Don't worry. I told him
to honk if he sees a tunnel cougar.

14:16.230 --> 14:17.106
[both laugh]

14:17.565 --> 14:19.525
You told him about tunnel cougars?

14:20.651 --> 14:23.779
I just used that to mess with you
and Rooster when you were kids.

14:25.030 --> 14:25.990
[vehicle honks]

14:26.115 --> 14:27.199
There he is now.

14:29.368 --> 14:31.620
-Can't believe he fell for that. [laughs]
-I know.

14:31.829 --> 14:32.913
What an idiot, right?

14:33.330 --> 14:36.166
He don't know that tunnel cougars
only come out at night.

14:37.459 --> 14:38.961
You got a good heart, son.

14:40.421 --> 14:42.631
So, what can I do for you, boss?

14:42.715 --> 14:44.758
Alright. We gotta inseminate these two.

14:44.842 --> 14:46.802
We got six more lined up after that.

14:46.886 --> 14:47.970
So I need you...

14:48.554 --> 14:51.098
to get your ass over there
and sterilize that equipment.

14:51.640 --> 14:52.850
And it better be spotless.

14:53.225 --> 14:56.270
It will be. I take great pride in my work.

14:56.854 --> 14:59.648
Okay. It's not fun when you wanna do it.

15:06.405 --> 15:07.990
Your cow is breathing heavy.

15:08.324 --> 15:09.992
Yeah. I saw it.

15:10.409 --> 15:13.913
I think she just ate some rocks or dirt,
probably stuck in her stomach.

15:14.330 --> 15:15.831
You know, cows are so dumb.

15:16.081 --> 15:18.751
I ate a rock once
but that was for a quarter.

15:21.253 --> 15:22.463
I don't think so.

15:23.172 --> 15:24.882
Looks like an allergic reaction.

15:25.716 --> 15:27.593
Gotta give her a shot of epinephrine.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.345
No.

15:29.845 --> 15:32.097
She just ate something. I know my herd.

15:33.182 --> 15:35.935
If you don't give her a shot,
she'll be dead by tonight.

15:36.018 --> 15:39.480
I'm not gonna waste a shot of epinephrine
on a cow that don't need it.

15:39.563 --> 15:42.733
It'll knock her outta heat. I won't
be able to breed her for another month.

15:42.816 --> 15:45.194
-You won't breed her at all if she's dead.
-Dad!

15:46.070 --> 15:47.029
It's my ranch.

15:47.655 --> 15:48.489
It's my call.

15:49.573 --> 15:51.158
Believe it or not, I know what I'm doing.

15:51.367 --> 15:52.409
[vehicle honks]

15:55.371 --> 15:57.373
[country music playing]

15:59.041 --> 15:59.875
Hey!

16:00.709 --> 16:01.919
Thanks for meeting me.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.462
Yeah. What's the emergency?

16:03.545 --> 16:06.215
They set up a DUI checkpoint,
now you're trapped here?

16:06.340 --> 16:08.008
Um... Is that true?

16:09.093 --> 16:10.260
I'll take some water.

16:11.762 --> 16:14.264
Look, this is a... little awkward--

16:14.348 --> 16:15.265
Oh, God!

16:15.349 --> 16:16.642
Are you gonna ask me out?

16:17.559 --> 16:19.561
Every stepdad does this.

16:21.438 --> 16:23.691
No, your mom asked to borrow some money.

16:24.358 --> 16:25.192
[Heather sighs]

16:25.275 --> 16:26.276
Jesus!

16:27.194 --> 16:30.030
Said you're having trouble
with the mortgage. That true?

16:30.280 --> 16:32.741
No trouble.
We just haven't paid it in six months.

16:34.326 --> 16:35.703
I'm... sorry.

16:36.328 --> 16:38.038
-She shouldn't have asked you.
-No.

16:38.122 --> 16:40.666
I like your mom. I wanna help you guys.

16:42.584 --> 16:43.919
That's nice of you, but...

16:44.878 --> 16:46.422
this isn't your problem.

16:48.841 --> 16:49.925
I want to.

16:50.175 --> 16:52.720
I just don't think she should be trusted
with this.

16:53.095 --> 16:54.096
You should take it now,

16:54.179 --> 16:57.141
'cause there's a strip club
and a Dave &amp; Buster's on my ride home,

16:57.224 --> 16:58.350
and I'm only human.

17:01.061 --> 17:02.604
Just make sure it goes to the mortgage.

17:07.901 --> 17:08.736
Thank you.

17:09.236 --> 17:10.529
[inhales sharply] Know what?

17:11.572 --> 17:14.700
A lap dance and a game of Whac-A-Mole
is not gonna kill anyone.

17:23.417 --> 17:24.460
-[Colt] Hi.
-Hey.

17:25.252 --> 17:27.337
-Thanks for helping me out today.
-Sure.

17:27.671 --> 17:29.840
How about tomorrow
you try not to be late?

17:31.508 --> 17:33.385
Oh, I can't make any promises.

17:34.386 --> 17:36.263
I'm trying out a new conditioner.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.477
And if it doesn't give me enough
bounce and shine...

17:42.936 --> 17:46.106
I'm gonna have to spend
a little extra time with the diffuser.

17:48.025 --> 17:50.319
Once again,
that's a perfectly valid excuse.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.947
Let me know if the diffuser doesn't work

17:54.031 --> 17:56.575
'cause I got a hot-oil treatment
that's to die for.

17:59.119 --> 18:00.329
[Dale laughing]

18:00.662 --> 18:02.748
Beau Bennett, ranch hand.

18:03.791 --> 18:06.710
I never thought
you could teach an old dog new tricks.

18:07.211 --> 18:12.091
However, I did just teach
my German Shepherd to turn on my Netflix.

18:14.218 --> 18:15.177
Poor dog.

18:16.136 --> 18:19.348
Each year he spends with you
feels like seven for him.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.394
I just checked out your sick heifer.

18:24.645 --> 18:26.438
Her eyes are still a little puffy

18:26.522 --> 18:29.650
but the worst
of her allergic reaction's cleared up.

18:29.942 --> 18:34.655
Otherwise, we'd have to ship her out
and make her chicken fried steak.

18:37.658 --> 18:40.786
Back up. You said, "allergic reaction"?

18:41.537 --> 18:44.581
Err... Well, why are you so surprised?

18:44.665 --> 18:46.542
You musta given her epinephrine.

18:49.795 --> 18:51.046
After I told you...

18:52.214 --> 18:53.882
I didn't wanna give her a shot,

18:54.341 --> 18:56.135
you went ahead and did it anyway.

18:57.344 --> 18:58.804
That heifer was gonna die.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.557
Are you so goddamn hard-headed,

19:01.640 --> 19:03.892
you'd rather have a dead cow
than be wrong?

19:04.977 --> 19:06.186
I did what I had to do.

19:06.270 --> 19:08.605
No, you did whatever the hell
you wanted to do.

19:09.064 --> 19:11.400
'Cause you don't give a shit
about anyone else.

19:11.525 --> 19:13.777
I knew bringing you on here was a mistake.

19:13.861 --> 19:15.487
One in a line of many.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.240
Look, fellas,
why don't we go down to Charlie's--

19:18.323 --> 19:19.867
[both] Shut the fuck up, Dale!

19:26.915 --> 19:28.167
Hey! How you doing?

19:29.042 --> 19:30.043
Great. Yeah.

19:30.127 --> 19:34.089
I'm just spending quality time
with my daughter that I love and miss.

19:35.090 --> 19:37.593
[laughs sarcastically]
Oh wait. No, I'm not.

19:37.926 --> 19:39.511
'Cause a couple of hours ago,

19:39.595 --> 19:41.138
Abby sent me a text saying,

19:41.221 --> 19:43.557
"Running late.
I'm covering detention. Sorry."

19:43.640 --> 19:45.350
When I texted, "How much longer?",

19:45.434 --> 19:48.020
she sent me an emoji of a girl shrugging.

19:50.814 --> 19:53.775
"Hey, Peyton, where was your father
your entire childhood?"

19:57.446 --> 19:58.530
I know it sucks,

19:58.614 --> 20:01.533
but Peyton is lucky to have a dad
who wants to be with her.

20:01.909 --> 20:04.286
My ex wanted to be
with young women, but...

20:04.536 --> 20:06.121
none of them were his daughter.

20:08.749 --> 20:10.792
Heard you got into it with your dad today.

20:10.876 --> 20:13.295
Oh yeah. Tell you he went behind my back,

20:13.378 --> 20:16.215
did the exact opposite of what
I told him to do 'cause he's an asshole?

20:16.715 --> 20:20.594
Well, he didn't exactly put it like that,
but the word "asshole" was in there.

20:23.263 --> 20:26.558
He just thinks he knows better
than everyone about everything.

20:26.642 --> 20:28.352
Yeah? Where did you get that idea?

20:28.977 --> 20:32.356
Is it 'cause he has that pillow that says
"My way or the wrong way"?

20:35.234 --> 20:37.819
I'm so tired of fucking fighting
with him all the time.

20:37.903 --> 20:40.989
Well, let me ask you something.
Are you glad that cow's alive?

20:41.531 --> 20:42.366
Yeah, of course.

20:42.449 --> 20:45.911
And if Dale had told you to give the cow
a shot, instead of your dad,

20:45.994 --> 20:47.037
would you have done it?

20:49.122 --> 20:50.332
I don't know. Maybe.

20:50.415 --> 20:53.126
Your dad has a lifetime
of ranching experience.

20:53.210 --> 20:54.962
He doesn't always
go about it the right way,

20:55.045 --> 20:57.339
but I think he really wants to help.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.092
Yeah. It wasn't just a shot.

21:00.926 --> 21:01.802
I mean...

21:02.511 --> 21:05.347
he sterilized the equipment twice.
He only had to do it once.

21:05.430 --> 21:06.640
It's just fucking weird.

21:08.600 --> 21:09.476
[door squeaks]

21:09.643 --> 21:11.770
-[Abby] Oh! Hey!
-[Joanne] Evening, Abby.

21:11.853 --> 21:13.730
Yeah. Evening, Abby.

21:18.986 --> 21:21.363
-[Peyton gurgles]
-Hey, peapod.

21:22.114 --> 21:22.948
Hi.

21:23.323 --> 21:26.118
Listen, Momma's gonna talk to Papa
for a bit, okay?

21:26.201 --> 21:28.287
So you can hang out with Grandma--
Granny-- Auntie--

21:28.370 --> 21:29.621
What we calling you?

21:29.830 --> 21:30.664
Uh.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.083
I dunno. I wanna let her decide.

21:33.166 --> 21:35.669
Just so long as it's not
what your dad calls you.

21:45.679 --> 21:48.223
Am I wrong, or did we agree on 4:30?

21:49.016 --> 21:51.685
I know. I'm sorry.
I had to take over detention, okay?

21:51.768 --> 21:52.811
Ms. Lowell called in sick

21:52.894 --> 21:55.897
the same day Martin Truex is
at a Bass Pro Shop in Denver.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.691
"We all wanna get our boobs signed, Amy,

21:57.774 --> 21:59.526
but someone's gotta teach
these little shits."

22:02.112 --> 22:05.157
We literally talked about this yesterday.

22:05.949 --> 22:07.701
I'm not getting enough time with Peyton.

22:08.201 --> 22:09.411
And you promised.

22:09.828 --> 22:12.789
And then on the first day,
you're fucking two hours late?

22:12.873 --> 22:15.959
Okay, woah! I said that I was sorry,
alright? It's my job.

22:16.209 --> 22:19.296
I'm new at the school, they asked me
to do it. I didn't feel I could say no.

22:19.379 --> 22:20.672
Yeah, I got a job, too.

22:21.089 --> 22:22.716
I got a bunch of shit over at the ranch.

22:22.799 --> 22:24.593
I coulda spent the last two hours
doing that.

22:24.676 --> 22:26.845
Or... I coulda went and seen
Martin Truex.

22:26.928 --> 22:30.015
Sounds like if I'd done that,
I might've seen Amy's boobs!

22:33.268 --> 22:36.229
I'm sorry things didn't work out
the way we planned.

22:36.313 --> 22:38.482
Yeah. You know what?
I don't wanna hear it.

22:38.857 --> 22:40.859
When it comes to spending time
with my daughter,

22:40.942 --> 22:42.319
"sorry" is not good enough.

22:42.944 --> 22:44.863
Okay, I'm trying my best.

22:44.946 --> 22:46.239
You don't have to be an asshole.

22:46.573 --> 22:48.408
[laughs manically] There you go.

22:48.533 --> 22:50.660
Once again, it's my fault. Right?

22:50.744 --> 22:53.038
-Well...
-You know what? I don't even care.

22:53.121 --> 22:55.040
You already cost me two hours
with her.

22:55.123 --> 22:56.458
I ain't gonna waste any more.

22:56.541 --> 22:58.251
So, you're just gonna walk away,
that's it?

23:11.014 --> 23:12.057
[exhales]

23:16.061 --> 23:17.979
Holy shit!

23:18.897 --> 23:20.524
McRib jackpot!

23:23.068 --> 23:24.861
Rooster, I wish I could've met you.

23:25.862 --> 23:29.199
Much like the McRib,
you were here for a limited time only.

23:30.283 --> 23:31.159
[door knocks]

23:31.535 --> 23:32.369
Err...

23:32.661 --> 23:33.537
Come in.

23:35.038 --> 23:35.872
Hey.

23:36.706 --> 23:37.916
Hey, Heather. What's up?

23:37.999 --> 23:40.836
I'd offer you something to eat
but I don't have anything.

23:41.169 --> 23:42.546
I don't mean to bother you.

23:42.629 --> 23:45.298
I gotta talk to you about something
and I don't have your number.

23:45.966 --> 23:49.553
Oh, boy. You're about to ask me out.
Every stepdaughter does this.

23:50.971 --> 23:52.139
No. [sighs]

23:52.305 --> 23:54.391
I deposited that money you gave me and...

23:54.808 --> 23:57.602
before I had a chance
to write the mortgage check...

23:58.061 --> 23:59.479
my mom drained the account.

24:00.730 --> 24:01.606
Shit.

24:02.816 --> 24:03.733
Where is she?

24:03.817 --> 24:05.652
[sighs] I have no idea.

24:07.988 --> 24:08.864
Hmm.

24:10.782 --> 24:11.783
[man speaking from TV]

24:15.203 --> 24:16.746
-Hi.
-Hey.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.167
Watching Anderson Cooper?

24:20.375 --> 24:21.251
Yeah.

24:21.877 --> 24:25.422
Real world's so depressing,
I wanted to see a little fiction.

24:30.552 --> 24:32.345
One silver fox to the next.

24:35.932 --> 24:36.766
Can you talk?

24:36.850 --> 24:37.684
I can.

24:38.393 --> 24:39.728
I prefer not to.

24:40.353 --> 24:41.188
[TV clicks off]

24:45.400 --> 24:46.526
About the other day...

24:48.737 --> 24:49.571
I was wrong.

24:51.239 --> 24:54.034
You saved my heifer.
All I should've said was thank you.

24:56.203 --> 24:57.662
I'm the one that was wrong.

24:58.580 --> 24:59.998
I hired on to help you.

25:00.790 --> 25:02.792
I should've supported your decision.

25:02.876 --> 25:04.419
Instead, I second-guessed ya.

25:05.504 --> 25:08.840
I shoulda just listened to you. I...

25:09.716 --> 25:13.553
I got all caught up in the fact you were
telling me what to do on my ranch,

25:14.054 --> 25:16.306
it just turned me into a stubborn asshole.

25:17.015 --> 25:18.767
You come by that honestly.

25:25.273 --> 25:26.942
I think I'm in over my head, Dad.

25:30.779 --> 25:32.155
What are you talking about?

25:32.989 --> 25:34.074
I failed at football.

25:36.952 --> 25:38.370
I'm failing in my marriage.

25:39.829 --> 25:42.541
Maybe this ranch is just one more thing
I'm failing at.

25:44.626 --> 25:46.169
Colt, you made one mistake.

25:47.337 --> 25:48.171
No.

25:48.838 --> 25:49.673
That's not true.

25:51.216 --> 25:52.592
Ever since I got the ranch,

25:52.676 --> 25:54.886
all I made is one bad decision
after another.

25:56.054 --> 25:58.431
Timed the market wrong,
didn't sell any cattle.

26:00.141 --> 26:02.686
Bought a worthless bull
and the only reason I bought it,

26:02.769 --> 26:06.189
it had a circle around its eye
like the dog in the Target commercial.

26:08.483 --> 26:10.860
If I'd just listened to you,
in the first place,

26:10.944 --> 26:13.029
I never woulda bought that stupid ranch.

26:14.197 --> 26:15.031
Colt...

26:16.408 --> 26:17.993
every mistake you've made,

26:18.451 --> 26:20.370
I've made. And then some.

26:21.329 --> 26:23.498
I sold off heifers I shoulda kept.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.084
Had bulls die on my watch.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.086
I hired fucking Dale.

26:31.298 --> 26:34.301
If you don't think you know
what you're doing, join the damn club.

26:37.220 --> 26:39.598
You kept Iron River running
for 50 years.

26:40.181 --> 26:43.143
If I make it through the winter,
it'd be a fucking miracle.

26:43.935 --> 26:44.811
[sighs]

26:46.187 --> 26:48.064
What you been through this first year

26:48.148 --> 26:50.191
would take down almost any rancher.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.819
But you kept it afloat.

26:54.154 --> 26:55.655
And you did that by yourself.

26:57.532 --> 27:00.619
Hell, I almost went under four times,
and I had you and Rooster.

27:00.702 --> 27:01.536
[scoffs]

27:01.828 --> 27:04.039
Sure that ain't the reason
you almost went under?

27:08.460 --> 27:10.420
Now, that's definitely a theory.

27:14.633 --> 27:16.301
Things are gonna be okay, Colt.

27:18.345 --> 27:20.180
You'll have easier years than this.

27:22.265 --> 27:23.808
You're a good rancher, Colt.

27:27.520 --> 27:28.772
Sure don't feel like it.

27:28.855 --> 27:32.400
I thought you said you were gonna start
respecting my fucking opinion.

27:35.612 --> 27:38.323
If I say you're a good rancher,
you're a good rancher.

27:42.410 --> 27:43.328
Thank you.

27:44.954 --> 27:46.122
And in the meantime,

27:46.498 --> 27:47.874
if you ever need anything,

27:48.500 --> 27:49.918
I'm right down the road.

27:50.001 --> 27:52.504
Bullshit! We start at 5:00 a.m.

27:54.506 --> 27:55.840
Jesus! That's early.

27:56.466 --> 27:59.260
Best to just push on through
and drink all night.

28:01.179 --> 28:02.013
[Colt chuckles]

28:02.514 --> 28:03.348
You know...

28:03.640 --> 28:06.518
I think I like you better
when you're pretending to be me.

28:08.311 --> 28:09.312

28:18.321 --> 28:19.155

-[Abby] Well...
-[Peyton gurgles]

28:25.078 --> 28:27.038
I wanted to give you your picture back.

28:27.789 --> 28:30.083
No. It's... This is for Peyton.

28:30.542 --> 28:33.461
Since I don't get to see her,
I don't want her to forget...

28:33.545 --> 28:34.921
Goddamn! Look at me.

28:35.547 --> 28:39.008
It's like every time I think I've peaked,
camera says otherwise.

28:40.427 --> 28:43.138
She's not gonna need it
'cause you're gonna see her every day,

28:43.221 --> 28:45.098
starting right now with an overnight.

28:46.975 --> 28:48.101
[Peyton gurgles]

28:49.352 --> 28:51.229
I thought you said you weren't ready.

28:51.688 --> 28:53.690
-What about breastfeeding?
-[Abby sighs]

28:54.649 --> 28:57.068
It's important that we both
get equal time with her, so...

28:57.152 --> 28:59.195
I pumped enough milk
to get her through breakfast.

28:59.529 --> 29:01.364
And before you ask,
no, I didn't pump extra,

29:01.448 --> 29:03.158
so you can't use it in your Cocoa Puffs.

29:04.159 --> 29:04.993
[clears throat]

29:05.535 --> 29:06.786

29:20.258 --> 29:22.802

how much this means to me.

I know. I'm pretty great.

on daddy-daughter time.

I'm gonna take real good care of her.

I know. That's why
I'm giving her to you right now.

29:56.544 --> 29:57.962

-Yeah. Let's...
-Okay.

29:59.881 --> 30:01.341
-Alright. Come here.

Are you kidding?

on the bed together.

It was.

his fucking cell phone into the casket.

we had to call it.

have to be "I Will Survive"?

[bird hooting]

31:33.349 --> 31:35.810
You know, all this about Glenn
has got me thinking

31:35.894 --> 31:38.855
about what my cabin in Montana
would look like.

31:39.063 --> 31:40.231
Hmm. Let me guess.

in the Reagan Library.

31:43.860 --> 31:46.779
Alright, maybe I'll have two cabins
in Montana.

31:50.867 --> 31:53.620
Did you know you always fall asleep
with your glasses on?

31:53.870 --> 31:55.663
-I do not.
-You do.

31:56.164 --> 31:58.041
I take them off almost every night

31:58.124 --> 32:00.168
when we're in there watching TV.

32:01.628 --> 32:03.171
I put them on one time.

32:03.713 --> 32:07.050

from the kitchen table.

32:07.133 --> 32:08.051
[Joanne laughs]

32:08.635 --> 32:09.802
I probably fall asleep

32:09.886 --> 32:12.305
cause you make me watch
boring John Wayne movies.

32:12.388 --> 32:14.390
Why is he the only one with a good aim?

32:14.474 --> 32:15.767
'Cause he's The Duke!

You also bite your lip when you're doing
a crossword puzzle.

with all the utensils,

32:26.986 --> 32:29.238
even though we're just ordering a pizza.

32:31.157 --> 32:32.867
And you take all my pencils

32:33.743 --> 32:34.994
to put in your hair,

32:35.578 --> 32:36.955
and I never see 'em again.

32:49.342 --> 32:51.719
I'm talking about my cabin in Montana.

32:54.138 --> 32:56.265
I stayed up all night thinking about it.

32:57.934 --> 32:59.811
I thought about a thousand things.

33:01.854 --> 33:03.564
But none of them appealed to me.

33:06.776 --> 33:08.236
But you know what I realized?

Every one of those things
that I thought about,

you were right there with me.
