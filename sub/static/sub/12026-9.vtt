31:20.178 --> 31:22.212

I'm gonna stretch my straps
out,

31:50.910 --> 31:53.277
I'm gonna tie 'em
to this tree back here

31:53.279 --> 31:55.779

<i>it's a monumental challenge.</i>

in reverse.

32:23.676 --> 32:25.876
This tire is gonna spin,

32:25.878 --> 32:29.980

this tire like a giant winch.

32:29.982 --> 32:33.350

where there's no cracks,

36:39.264 --> 36:42.399
where the snow isn't so deep,

<i>plummets to depths</i>
<i>of over 300 feet.</i>

36:59.884 --> 37:04.888

we got some heavy (bleep) loads

37:53.639 --> 37:54.738
