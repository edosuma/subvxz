05:14.606 --> 05:18.441
<i>If you'd like to make a call,</i>
<i>please hang up and...</i>

05:39.047 --> 05:41.630
Aim. Fire.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.917
Aim. Fire.

06:31.808 --> 06:35.222
How do you go from the top
of your game to suicide?

06:36.396 --> 06:39.810
He was the last Marine
I thought would eat his own gun.

06:40.191 --> 06:42.478
Doesn't make any sense to me.

06:44.029 --> 06:46.646
It's a tough job, what we do.

06:47.699 --> 06:50.863
For some, more exacting.

06:51.786 --> 06:54.199
Worthington was a legend, though.

06:54.372 --> 06:56.534
If it happened to him...

06:56.708 --> 06:59.121
- ...what's next for me?
- You know...

06:59.294 --> 07:03.129
...you can't have any emotion to do this job.

07:03.715 --> 07:06.128
You're just part of the weapon.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.342
But I pull the trigger.

07:08.511 --> 07:11.219
Orders pull the trigger.

07:14.476 --> 07:16.468
Whatever you want...

07:16.645 --> 07:18.637
...the answer's no.

07:21.399 --> 07:22.856
You haven't even heard the ask.

07:24.069 --> 07:26.777
Worthington had 68 confirmed kills.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.155
I'm at 63. That's close enough.

07:29.324 --> 07:30.656
I knew Tommy too.

07:30.825 --> 07:32.862
It hurts like hell, what happened to him.

07:33.244 --> 07:34.780
I'm starting to think...

07:34.955 --> 07:37.413
...that I have more days behind me
than ahead of me.

07:37.582 --> 07:40.746
The days behind us determine the days ahead.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.333
- What does that even mean?
- I have no idea...

07:44.506 --> 07:47.419
...but it was said with certainty
and conviction.

07:50.011 --> 07:52.628
Come on, Brandon, you'll get over it.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.514
- You always do.
- Look, I can't do it.

07:55.684 --> 07:57.596
My head's not in it.

07:57.769 --> 08:00.682
That's not what your fitness test
and psych evaluation says.

08:03.024 --> 08:05.357
Come on, we need you down there.

08:08.029 --> 08:11.864
- Down where?
- Bogotá, Colombia.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.696
Ever heard of the Joint Task Force,
Southern Command?

08:14.869 --> 08:15.950
JTF.

08:16.287 --> 08:20.497
Multi-service operation, run by the DOD,
tasked with counter-drug...

08:20.667 --> 08:22.750
...and anti-terrorist ops
in the Southern Hemisphere.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.831
Correctomundo, master sergeant.

08:25.005 --> 08:28.624
They also coordinate support between
federal agencies: the DEA, DHS...

08:28.800 --> 08:30.416
- CIA.
- Yeah.

08:30.593 --> 08:33.427
Langley does have its fingerprints
on everything.

08:33.596 --> 08:35.837
You might also know who's head of operations.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.474
You mean, Master Gunnery Sergeant
Thomas Beckett?

08:38.643 --> 08:40.600
Yeah, heard he's at JTF now.

08:40.770 --> 08:45.140
You get to work with your father,
and Bogotá's lovely this time of year.

08:45.775 --> 08:47.482
How's your Spanish?

08:47.652 --> 08:50.520
- Shitty.
- Perfect. You're hired.

08:51.322 --> 08:53.234
- I said, no.
- I know, I heard you.

08:53.408 --> 08:57.243
There's a car parked right over there.
There's a jet waiting for that car.

08:58.288 --> 09:00.450
You don't wanna miss this one.

09:01.041 --> 09:04.159
Smile. You're going to Colombia.

09:04.335 --> 09:07.874
Bring me back a bag of coffee
and a beauty queen.

09:32.489 --> 09:34.902
So first time here?

09:35.533 --> 09:36.614
<i>Yup.</i>

09:36.785 --> 09:38.822
Closest I've been is San Padre Island.

09:38.995 --> 09:40.531
Spring break, right?

09:40.705 --> 09:42.571
Something like that.

09:46.920 --> 09:50.334
I'm just saying, it's a long way
from San Padre Island.

09:51.674 --> 09:54.132
So, Marine Scout Sniper Beckett...

09:54.844 --> 09:57.427
Sixty-three confirmed kills.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.840
Just promoted to master sergeant.
That's pretty impressive.

10:01.309 --> 10:02.891
So you like that shit?

10:03.061 --> 10:04.347
Dragging through the mud...

10:04.521 --> 10:07.685
...laying in the weeds,
shooting bad guys from...

10:07.857 --> 10:10.440
What is that, like a mile away?

10:10.985 --> 10:13.693
Well, that's not how we do it in the DEA.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.855
So, what happened to your face?

10:16.032 --> 10:18.445
That from a drug bust?

10:19.953 --> 10:21.865
I don't know, I...

10:22.038 --> 10:24.121
I got myself a girlfriend down here, and...

10:24.582 --> 10:28.201
...you know, she's crazy jealous...

10:28.378 --> 10:30.586
...and, well, she took a swipe, and...

10:31.256 --> 10:33.543
It was my fault, really.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.809
Santiago Calderón.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.398
I've been assigned to you.

10:55.572 --> 10:58.485
- Assigned?
- Yes. You're going to need a spotter.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.399
How much time you got on glass?

11:01.953 --> 11:04.445
- Enough.
- Hey, Long Shot, this way.

11:08.793 --> 11:12.787
This is Captain Hector Garza,
he's our liaison, local team leader.

11:12.964 --> 11:16.128
He runs the Colombian
drug-trafficking task force.

11:18.887 --> 11:21.846
Master sergeant, good to have you onboard.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.051
Thank you, sir.

11:23.224 --> 11:26.058
You met Walsh, my number two.

11:26.227 --> 11:29.186
He's got a mouth on him.
Don't take it personally.

11:29.898 --> 11:33.642
And Santiago, best spotter in Colombia.

11:43.745 --> 11:46.579
Well, it's good to see you, master sergeant.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.739
Master guns.

11:48.917 --> 11:50.328
Welcome to South America.

11:51.169 --> 11:53.126
I bet you thought you'd never see me again.

11:53.296 --> 11:54.753
Well, one never knows with you.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.833
I was in Costa Rica fishing for dorado,
and the phone rang, so...

11:59.010 --> 12:01.127
- And you actually answered it.
- I did, yes.

12:01.304 --> 12:03.341
Enough said.

12:03.514 --> 12:04.971
Shall we?

12:07.435 --> 12:09.051
Thank you.

12:09.229 --> 12:12.188
This is the dorado we'll be fishing for.

12:12.357 --> 12:13.893
Jesús Morales.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.774
Colombian cartel chief.

12:15.944 --> 12:18.732
His empire controls 60 percent
of the routes...

12:18.905 --> 12:22.444
...carrying drugs and contraband
across the U.S. border.

12:22.617 --> 12:25.451
This guy's got his hooks
on everything from oil theft...

12:25.620 --> 12:28.078
...to human trafficking,
weapons dealings, you know.

12:28.248 --> 12:33.750
He specializes in recruiting street kids
into his gang he calls La Familia de Seis.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.583
- When was this picture taken?
- 2006.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.373
Since then, he's been completely off-grid.

12:39.550 --> 12:42.964
Never sleeps in the same place
two nights in a row...

12:43.137 --> 12:44.719
...travels at night.

12:44.889 --> 12:48.303
He has a network that is untraceable.

12:48.476 --> 12:51.810
- So no one's seen him in 10 years?
- No one in law enforcement.

12:51.980 --> 12:53.562
And now he's back.

12:53.731 --> 12:58.192
Over the last three months, his competition
has been eliminated, one by one.

12:58.361 --> 13:00.819
Bodies of his rivals turned up everywhere.

13:00.989 --> 13:03.857
But his latest one's on a different level.

13:04.575 --> 13:07.693
Sniper hit. Ten days ago.

13:09.330 --> 13:11.447
Now, that was Morales' worst rival.

13:11.624 --> 13:14.412
- Diego Paolo.
- He was painted in his bathtub?

13:15.253 --> 13:16.869
With his mistress watching.

13:17.046 --> 13:20.335
No self-trained player
could've made that shot.

13:20.508 --> 13:23.501
He's either military or ex-military.

13:23.678 --> 13:27.137
- You got the bullet?
- Local police didn't recover it.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.515
.50 cal from long distance.

13:29.684 --> 13:32.176
Bullet did most of the damage
as it slowed down.

13:32.520 --> 13:35.854
- Did the round pass through any walls?
- Just the window.

13:36.024 --> 13:37.890
Didn't even touch the curtains.

13:38.067 --> 13:40.810
Morales clearly has himself a hired gun...

13:40.987 --> 13:43.570
...who's helping him rise
to the top of the pile.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.197
So, what's my objective?

13:45.366 --> 13:47.983
We have a line on Morales' location,
day after tomorrow.

13:49.245 --> 13:51.862
Intel suggests
he will be at this farmhouse...

13:52.040 --> 13:55.078
...15 kilometers outside the city.

13:55.543 --> 13:58.126
So you're asking us
to counter Morales's sniper?

13:58.296 --> 14:01.209
It will be joint ops. DEA will be on point...

14:01.382 --> 14:04.216
...backed up by Captain Garza's task force.

14:06.012 --> 14:09.756
Due respect, sounds like a fancy way
of saying you want us to babysit.

14:11.267 --> 14:14.476
Let's say "overwatch," master sergeant.

14:16.564 --> 14:19.432
- You're late.
- Yeah, the fuck I am.

14:19.609 --> 14:21.225
You started early, captain.

14:21.611 --> 14:25.480
I gotta tell you, your macho Latino
power trip is starting to piss me off.

14:25.656 --> 14:28.114
You should know better
than to start without me, Walsh.

14:28.284 --> 14:31.868
This is my field operation,
and you say "yes" to me. Got it?

14:32.038 --> 14:33.950
- Yes, ma'am.
- Don't play games with me.

14:34.123 --> 14:37.457
I'll keep you all up way past your bedtime.
Now, am I late?

14:37.627 --> 14:40.791
Because my watch says 1300.
What does the clock on the wall say?

14:41.589 --> 14:45.048
- 1300. You're right on time.
- Exactly.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.088
Now, what did I miss?

14:48.513 --> 14:51.881
Master Sergeant Beckett
was being briefed on the op.

14:52.058 --> 14:54.175
Say hello to Kate Estrada, DEA.

14:54.977 --> 14:57.014
Here on assignment
out of Washington for three years.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.263
Speaks the language and knows the world.

15:00.441 --> 15:01.852
There has been a change.

15:02.026 --> 15:04.018
Operation moved up a day.

15:04.821 --> 15:07.313
We need to move on Morales tomorrow.

15:08.491 --> 15:10.357
Does that give you enough time to prep?

15:10.535 --> 15:13.949
I need to do some recon.
Drone analysis, topography checks.

15:14.122 --> 15:16.455
Yeah, he's right.
Otherwise, we can't back you up.

15:16.624 --> 15:20.038
Well, that's what we've got.
This is our first legitimate shot at him.

15:20.211 --> 15:23.375
We're gonna put him behind bars
or in the ground, tomorrow.

15:28.219 --> 15:30.006
Walk with me.

15:34.851 --> 15:36.888
They say you're the best. Is that true?

15:38.020 --> 15:39.807
I do what's asked of me, ma'am.

15:39.981 --> 15:41.768
Stop with the "ma'am" bullshit.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.648
"Estrada" works.

15:43.818 --> 15:45.650
Now, let me give you some context.

15:45.820 --> 15:49.313
I didn't want you here, with your long guns
and your "yes, ma'am" attitude.

15:49.490 --> 15:52.574
But the geniuses above my pay grade
wanted you watching my back.

15:52.743 --> 15:55.360
Evidently, Captain Garza's
Alpha Team isn't enough.

15:55.872 --> 15:58.489
So let me ask you the same question
in a different way.

15:58.916 --> 16:00.327
Are you enough?

16:01.002 --> 16:02.334
That's why they sent me.

16:03.045 --> 16:05.503
- Do you have any regional awareness?
- No.

16:05.673 --> 16:08.416
This is my first mission in South America.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.760
This mission is way north of high risk.

16:11.929 --> 16:15.889
Did you raise your hand, or did they point
to the map and put you on a plane?

16:16.601 --> 16:17.887
If I'm being honest...

16:18.060 --> 16:22.395
...I don't wanna come here
to do overwatch for the DEA.

16:23.107 --> 16:24.939
But the guys above my pay grade...

16:25.109 --> 16:27.817
...thought you were worth
keeping this side of the ground.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.855
Study up, and get some rest.

16:31.407 --> 16:33.364
Big day tomorrow.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.419
This is some mean bush, huh?

16:50.343 --> 16:52.255
Copy that.

16:54.555 --> 16:57.548
I hate these fucking rush jobs.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.352
That's war.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.638
What does the sat feed say?

17:04.815 --> 17:08.058
It says there's a lot of space, and...

17:08.236 --> 17:11.650
...that we are looking for a needle
in a haystack.

17:15.034 --> 17:19.494
You know, I was thinking
that this DEA <i>chica...</i>

17:19.664 --> 17:23.374
...likes a lot your strong-and-silent act.

17:24.085 --> 17:26.372
Fuck off, Santiago.

17:27.421 --> 17:29.253
Fucking off.

17:53.155 --> 17:55.192
Gear up. Gear up. Gear up.

17:55.366 --> 17:57.983
This is Estrada.
We're on final site and ready.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.992
Waiting for satellite uplink.

18:00.162 --> 18:01.778
We a go?

18:03.541 --> 18:05.032
Good to go, captain.

18:06.335 --> 18:08.827
Move for cover. Wait for my signal.

18:27.857 --> 18:29.393
Target indicators.

18:33.029 --> 18:34.315
Couple of trucks.

18:34.488 --> 18:35.695
Morales's Hummer.

18:35.865 --> 18:39.449
And other than that, nothing on glass.

18:45.041 --> 18:46.577
This is Mustang.

18:46.751 --> 18:49.789
We're in position
on the southernmost ridgeline.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.795
<i>We are standing by.</i>

18:55.384 --> 18:56.920
Samson.

18:57.637 --> 19:00.755
- Good of you to make the party.
- How we doing?

19:00.931 --> 19:03.173
Well, with a little luck,
within a few minutes...

19:03.351 --> 19:06.640
...we should be bagging one
of the biggest targets we've had in years.

19:06.812 --> 19:10.556
Satellite imagery confirms activity
at the site last night.

19:10.733 --> 19:13.601
I just got off the phone with Langley.
They wanna know if the intel's reliable.

19:13.778 --> 19:16.395
- It's all we have.
- Just tell me. Is he there?

19:16.572 --> 19:19.690
- I don't know. Maybe, maybe not.
- You're putting agents in harm's way...

19:19.867 --> 19:22.655
- ...on a fifty-fifty shot?
- This is the DEA's op.

19:22.828 --> 19:26.321
Estrada drew a line in the sand and said
she had to have the green light to go.

19:26.499 --> 19:27.740
It's too late to abort.

19:28.709 --> 19:31.918
When you go to the party,
there's always risk.

20:06.539 --> 20:07.825
How far to the farmhouse?

20:11.711 --> 20:14.419
Five hundred and sixteen meters.

20:14.588 --> 20:16.295
Wind...

20:16.841 --> 20:18.298
...one-half value.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.417
Do the math.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.717
Five degrees descending.

20:29.353 --> 20:31.345
No adjustments.

20:32.565 --> 20:36.809
- Hold scope.
- Holding on, and standing by.

20:59.550 --> 21:01.257
<i>This is Mustang, over.</i>

21:08.017 --> 21:09.053
This is Alpha Team.

21:10.311 --> 21:13.304
Eyes in the sky,
not seeing anyone inside the farmhouse.

21:13.481 --> 21:15.723
- Over.
- <i>Roger that, Alpha Team.</i>

21:15.900 --> 21:19.359
We are in position and holding scope.
We got a 300-degree view.

21:19.528 --> 21:21.315
What about the other 60 degrees?

21:21.489 --> 21:23.321
That's the southernmost ridgeline.

21:23.491 --> 21:25.232
That's where we're positioned.

21:25.409 --> 21:27.196
<i>We cleared as much as we could</i>
<i>coming in here.</i>

21:27.369 --> 21:29.361
Okay. Can we proceed?

21:30.206 --> 21:32.744
<i>Lot of area for me to cover</i>
<i>and for him to hide in.</i>

21:32.917 --> 21:35.330
<i>Proceed with extreme caution.</i>

21:35.503 --> 21:36.619
<i>Copy that.</i>

21:36.796 --> 21:38.583
DEA has precedence.

21:39.006 --> 21:41.794
Proceed with discretion, Alpha Team.

21:57.274 --> 22:00.142
Ingress in 200 meters.
Give me the final green.

22:00.319 --> 22:03.403
- Are they cleared hot?
- Cleared hot.

22:03.781 --> 22:06.273
- Go to guns.
- Go to guns.

22:25.386 --> 22:28.800
<i>Alpha Team Two approaching the house.</i>

22:33.227 --> 22:34.468
See anything?

22:35.062 --> 22:36.269
Nothing on glass.

22:36.897 --> 22:38.433
All clear.

22:40.901 --> 22:43.188
Final green, captain. We're cleared hot.

22:44.154 --> 22:45.986
Safeties off.

23:07.428 --> 23:08.885
Slow and steady.

24:10.908 --> 24:12.194
<i>Talk to me, Estrada.</i>

24:12.368 --> 24:14.906
Agent Estrada, what is your status?

24:15.079 --> 24:16.695
<i>Operation compromised.</i>

24:16.872 --> 24:18.579
Assessing casualties.

24:52.992 --> 24:55.450
- Enemy sniper on site.
- <i>Find him, master sergeant.</i>

24:55.619 --> 24:56.860
<i>Working on it, sir.</i>

25:10.426 --> 25:11.837
Stay where you are, Estrada.

25:12.011 --> 25:13.422
<i>I got this, Mustang.</i>

25:15.764 --> 25:17.926
Just find the shooter.

25:27.901 --> 25:29.392
Got something on the scope.

25:29.570 --> 25:31.402
Eleven o'clock. Right at the tree line.

25:33.490 --> 25:35.857
- Distance?
- Seven hundred and twenty-three meters.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.706
He's in the wind.

25:51.508 --> 25:52.589
Let's move.

26:14.740 --> 26:17.073
<i>Mustang approaching the site.</i>

26:21.038 --> 26:23.655
Come on, get up. Come on, come on.

26:45.395 --> 26:48.229
<i>This is Mustang to Dog's Den.</i>

26:48.690 --> 26:49.771
<i>Captain Garza is...</i>

26:51.110 --> 26:53.022
<i>...KIA.</i>

26:57.116 --> 26:58.527
<i>All right, let's play a game.</i>

26:58.700 --> 27:01.363
It's called, "Tell me
what the fuck happened out there."

27:01.537 --> 27:02.653
And you are?

27:02.830 --> 27:06.073
Special Agent John Samson,
Department of Homeland Security.

27:06.917 --> 27:09.830
Morales was a no-show.
That's what happened out there.

27:10.003 --> 27:11.414
It was a setup.

27:11.588 --> 27:14.956
Morales had a mole
inside of the National Police?

27:15.134 --> 27:18.343
- I didn't say that.
- The house was rigged to blow.

27:18.512 --> 27:21.425
It was a National Police op.
What other explanation is there?

27:21.598 --> 27:24.557
Look, you people have a management problem...

27:24.726 --> 27:26.683
...but I have an operational problem.

27:26.854 --> 27:30.188
This sniper is not just an assassin.
He's a pro.

27:30.357 --> 27:31.723
He knows fieldcraft.

27:31.900 --> 27:33.766
He knows what you're doing.

27:33.944 --> 27:35.355
He knows who all of us are.

27:35.529 --> 27:38.397
How would you know that?
I mean, he fired two shots.

27:38.866 --> 27:41.324
Two shots. Two hits.

27:41.785 --> 27:43.742
And then he was gone.

27:45.622 --> 27:49.286
He could have shot Garza
before Kate pulled him out.

27:49.459 --> 27:51.200
But he waited.

27:51.378 --> 27:52.459
For what?

27:54.673 --> 27:55.789
Sniper had one target:

27:56.884 --> 27:58.591
Estrada.

27:58.969 --> 28:02.007
Garza just got in the way. Lucky for you.

28:02.181 --> 28:06.892
Exactly. He sent us a message:
"Get the fuck out of Dodge."

28:07.060 --> 28:08.551
That's exactly what you're gonna do.

28:08.729 --> 28:11.062
You're gonna pull them out.
This is too dangerous.

28:11.231 --> 28:14.770
Don't do it, sir. I've been working this guy,
and this guy only, for three years.

28:14.943 --> 28:17.526
- I just need a little more time.
- Let's just take a deep breath...

28:17.696 --> 28:19.153
...and hit the reset button, okay?

28:19.323 --> 28:22.907
You're so far outside of operational
protocol, you could all be court-martialed.

28:23.076 --> 28:26.319
We lost eight good men
and a high-ranking officer, for chrissake.

28:26.496 --> 28:28.078
Yes, we did.

28:28.248 --> 28:30.581
Garza was a good friend and a colleague.

28:30.751 --> 28:32.242
And no one is gonna miss him more than me.

28:32.920 --> 28:35.583
But this was not reckless,
if that's where you're going.

28:35.756 --> 28:40.626
We did the best we could under
the circumstances and the intel we had.

28:40.802 --> 28:42.589
Shit happens, is that what you're telling me?

28:42.763 --> 28:44.755
Shit didn't happen today, sir.

28:44.932 --> 28:47.140
- Someone narc'd us out.
- All right, come on.

28:48.518 --> 28:50.305
Just give us another 48 hours.

28:51.021 --> 28:54.856
If we can't catch this guy's scent,
then we're gone.

28:58.195 --> 28:59.436
All right.

28:59.613 --> 29:02.697
I'm gonna give them 48 hours
to shake the trees.

29:02.866 --> 29:03.982
Nothing falls out...

29:04.451 --> 29:06.864
...then they'll be on the next plane
to the States.

29:07.037 --> 29:08.073
Get out of here.

29:08.247 --> 29:10.455
Forty-eight hours.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.375
Brandon.

29:27.724 --> 29:29.215
Sir?

29:29.393 --> 29:32.557
This sniper knows exactly who you are.

29:34.147 --> 29:36.560
So I want you to keep your head
on a swivel...

29:36.733 --> 29:38.895
...and your eyes wide open.

29:46.576 --> 29:48.283
You retired, master guns.

29:50.706 --> 29:52.117
What brought you back?

29:56.545 --> 29:59.504
Well, I mean, how many times
can you go fishing, right?

30:01.758 --> 30:03.340
That's it?

30:07.097 --> 30:09.384
I don't know. I guess...

30:10.934 --> 30:13.927
...I probably wanted to quit a dozen times...

30:14.104 --> 30:16.642
...but I just kept re-upping.

30:22.821 --> 30:25.529
I guess the Marine Corps was my life.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.650
It was my family.

30:36.668 --> 30:40.878
How can you be a civilian puke
after all those years in the crotch, right?

30:47.346 --> 30:49.087
Master sergeant.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.674
We're moving out.

30:57.939 --> 30:59.555
She's a good one.

30:59.733 --> 31:02.350
If a bit hard-headed at times.

31:03.904 --> 31:05.770
I like her, though.

31:06.323 --> 31:08.940
I read her file. It's quite impressive.

31:09.117 --> 31:10.528
You watch her back too.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.238
Roger that.

31:12.412 --> 31:13.994
And, sir?

31:16.500 --> 31:18.492
It's good to have you onboard.

31:51.660 --> 31:53.026
No offense...

31:53.203 --> 31:56.822
...there's a thousand places where
a trained sniper can hit this place from.

31:56.998 --> 31:58.364
Relax, master sergeant.

31:58.542 --> 32:02.081
This place has been checked out.
Nobody knows you're here, all right?

32:04.464 --> 32:08.424
Set up on the rooftop across the street,
start scanning those favelas.

32:08.593 --> 32:09.925
For now...

32:10.095 --> 32:11.961
...we just need to be on the safe side.

32:12.139 --> 32:14.552
That's a big fucking haystack, bro.

32:14.724 --> 32:17.182
- Find the needle.
- Yeah.

33:11.865 --> 33:14.858
What do you want? I'm busy.

33:15.035 --> 33:18.199
- Can't it wait?
- <i>You get another chance,</i> puto <i>Diablo.</i>

33:18.371 --> 33:21.705
<i>She's at the DEA safe house</i>
<i>in</i> el barrio de Las Cruces.

33:21.875 --> 33:24.492
<i>The American sniper is with her.</i>

34:04.584 --> 34:07.418
Thanks for backing me up at the office.

34:07.587 --> 34:09.043
Sure.

34:09.880 --> 34:13.670
We were both unprepared
for what happened out there.

34:15.344 --> 34:18.179
I've never lost a man under my command.

34:18.348 --> 34:21.887
If you stay in this business long enough,
it won't be the last time.

34:22.893 --> 34:24.010
How do you deal with it?

34:27.148 --> 34:29.561
Everyone has their way.

34:35.156 --> 34:36.862
What's your way?

34:38.868 --> 34:42.908
Well, I tell myself I'm on
the right side of the fight.

34:44.373 --> 34:47.913
I'm doing my best, I'm saving lives...

34:48.085 --> 34:49.918
...and I keep fighting.

34:50.088 --> 34:52.250
And you have to do the same.

34:57.679 --> 34:59.636
The second shot...

34:59.806 --> 35:03.015
...the one that killed Garza,
something's wrong.

35:03.184 --> 35:04.595
You're skeptical, huh?

35:05.437 --> 35:07.599
I think you're right to be.

35:08.481 --> 35:09.892
By my estimate...

35:10.066 --> 35:12.228
...his shot wasn't just improbable...

35:12.402 --> 35:13.893
...it was impossible.

35:18.533 --> 35:22.152
Sniper's hide, it was downrange
of our position, right here.

35:22.329 --> 35:24.571
We know because we made him. We fired on him.

35:25.123 --> 35:27.740
He fired his shot from over 1800 yards.

35:29.961 --> 35:32.169
Your position was here when Garza was hit.

35:32.339 --> 35:36.549
It's almost as if his second shot
followed you around the tractor.

35:36.718 --> 35:38.630
Look, I'm not interested in the sniper.

35:38.803 --> 35:40.840
- I want Morales.
- I know, Kate.

35:41.014 --> 35:44.098
I know. You want Morales.

35:44.267 --> 35:46.099
But it's that narrow-minded focus...

35:46.269 --> 35:48.636
...that just got a lot of people killed.

37:11.396 --> 37:12.557
How's it going up there?

37:12.731 --> 37:15.769
<i>Lots of hay. No needles.</i>

37:15.942 --> 37:18.025
- Keep your eye on the glass.
- <i>Copy that.</i>

37:53.897 --> 37:56.685
Get off, your hand, amigo.

38:02.781 --> 38:05.364
I said, get your hands off me.

38:26.346 --> 38:28.053
<i>Hola,</i> Kate.

38:28.223 --> 38:29.839
Let's go.

38:31.100 --> 38:32.557
My advice...

38:33.061 --> 38:36.475
...cut loose of this. You cannot win.

38:37.190 --> 38:39.432
I'm close, Father Carlos.

38:39.609 --> 38:41.601
Yes, you are.

38:43.238 --> 38:47.357
That's why he put eight
of your men in the morgue.

38:48.201 --> 38:50.989
I will not let this man survive.

38:51.162 --> 38:52.949
I'm not walking away.

38:53.122 --> 38:55.535
More people will die.

38:56.918 --> 38:58.784
Can you live with that?

39:00.046 --> 39:03.255
I can't live with myself
if I walk out on this job.

39:05.552 --> 39:07.134
Okay.

39:08.012 --> 39:09.594
Okay.

39:11.224 --> 39:13.807
<i>I think I got something up here.</i>

39:14.185 --> 39:15.721
On my way.

39:19.190 --> 39:21.022
"El Diablo"...

39:21.192 --> 39:23.434
...is what they call the sniper.

39:23.611 --> 39:25.648
He can lead you to Morales.

39:25.822 --> 39:27.939
But it's dangerous, <i>mija.</i>

39:28.867 --> 39:32.486
Once El Diablo has your name, you are dead.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.616
Then help me...

39:39.252 --> 39:41.869
...before he checks me off his list.

39:46.426 --> 39:47.917
I'll be in touch.

39:55.393 --> 39:57.100
Trust nobody.

39:57.270 --> 39:59.557
- Yeah.
- Okay.

40:21.294 --> 40:23.502
Talk to me, Santiago.

40:23.671 --> 40:27.415
<i>Twenty-two degrees north-northwest.</i>

40:27.592 --> 40:32.428
<i>Elevation 12.</i>
<i>Looks like a range-finder laser.</i>

40:37.393 --> 40:39.555
That's exactly what it is.

40:39.729 --> 40:41.265
Good work, Santiago.

40:41.981 --> 40:44.940
<i>Distance, 1750 meters.</i>

40:45.944 --> 40:48.607
<i>Bullet travel time, 1.6 seconds.</i>

42:09.944 --> 42:12.402
Well done, master sergeant.

42:13.448 --> 42:14.984
Wait.

42:16.576 --> 42:18.192
What is it?

42:18.828 --> 42:20.990
What you're looking at
is your standard-issue...

42:21.164 --> 42:23.121
...laser-guided smart bullet.

42:23.958 --> 42:26.996
<i>DARPA completed its live-fire testing...</i>

42:27.170 --> 42:29.162
<i>...in July of 2014.</i>

42:29.338 --> 42:32.422
- How do you know?
- <i>I'm the one who tested it.</i>

42:32.592 --> 42:38.509
<i>I'll pull it up now.</i>
<i>It's fire-and-forget technology.</i>

42:38.681 --> 42:42.971
<i>The projectile itself is fin-stabilized</i>
<i>and spin-stabilized.</i>

42:43.478 --> 42:46.016
<i>Remote guidance is tied to an optics system.</i>

42:46.189 --> 42:49.307
<i>The bullet is capable of readjusting</i>
<i>position 30 times a second...</i>

42:49.484 --> 42:52.943
<i>...while hitting a moving target</i>
<i>up to a mile away.</i>

42:53.112 --> 42:54.273
My God.

42:54.447 --> 42:56.734
Whatever happened
to just learning how to shoot?

42:56.908 --> 42:59.491
- <i>Glory days, master guns.</i>
- You got that right.

43:00.703 --> 43:03.320
Gotta ask you, are you still GS-9?

43:03.498 --> 43:07.117
<i>You know, I actually managed</i>
<i>to move up in the ranks since...</i>

43:07.293 --> 43:09.034
- Panama.
- <i>Yeah, I was gonna say...</i>

43:09.212 --> 43:11.169
<i>...since I started going a little gray.</i>

43:11.339 --> 43:14.127
<i>But you're looking pretty good yourself,</i>
<i>Colonel Sanders.</i>

43:15.176 --> 43:17.919
- <i>Man, that was a long time ago.</i>
- Over 20 years ago, I think.

43:18.096 --> 43:19.132
<i>Feels like it.</i>

43:19.806 --> 43:23.220
<i>You know, when DOD told me you were</i>
<i>on the team, I couldn't believe it.</i>

43:23.559 --> 43:25.926
Gentlemen, I hate to break up this reunion...

43:26.104 --> 43:28.312
- ...but could we get back to work?
- <i>All right.</i>

43:29.107 --> 43:30.643
<i>Where did you find this, Brandon?</i>

43:30.817 --> 43:32.729
<i>Or, more to the point, where'd it find you?</i>

43:33.236 --> 43:34.852
It was shot at me last night.

43:35.321 --> 43:37.859
By the sniper we think works for Morales.

43:38.032 --> 43:40.570
<i>Not much of a safe house</i>
<i>you've got there, Samson.</i>

43:40.743 --> 43:42.905
<i>Let me state the obvious</i>
<i>and bust some balls...</i>

43:43.079 --> 43:45.947
<i>...but you mind getting a safe house</i>
<i>that is actually safe?</i>

43:46.124 --> 43:49.743
- Already done, sir.
- <i>All right, let me talk to some people.</i>

43:50.086 --> 43:52.749
<i>There's only so many points of access</i>
<i>to get to this tech.</i>

43:53.256 --> 43:57.546
<i>If Morales has it, we may be looking</i>
<i>at an internal-security issue.</i>

43:57.927 --> 43:59.839
<i>Okay, I'm on it.</i>

44:00.012 --> 44:03.847
All right. I'll scramble a vehicle
to take you two to a CIA black site...

44:04.016 --> 44:06.008
...on the south side of the city. Let's go.

44:14.569 --> 44:16.026
I'm getting hustled here.

44:17.280 --> 44:20.068
- Are you hustling me, boy?
- No, Señor Morales.

44:20.241 --> 44:21.857
Hustling you?

44:35.798 --> 44:38.962
- You think it's fun beating the boss?
- No, <i>patrón.</i>

44:39.135 --> 44:43.254
No, <i>patrón, perdón, perdón.</i>
Here, take your money back. It's yours.

44:43.723 --> 44:44.804
Listen, boy...

44:44.974 --> 44:49.059
...to get ahead in this line of work,
a man is expected to win, you know?

44:51.314 --> 44:53.931
What do I do to win?

44:54.734 --> 44:58.523
Show no fear.

44:59.906 --> 45:02.899
Fear is your greatest enemy.

45:04.535 --> 45:06.117
Are you scared, boy?

45:13.252 --> 45:14.834
No, <i>patrón.</i>

45:17.381 --> 45:19.247
Nice.

45:25.598 --> 45:27.635
Come on, I was kidding, <i>huevón.</i>

45:31.604 --> 45:34.062
Take the money. It's yours. You win it.

45:34.523 --> 45:36.264
You must never...

45:36.442 --> 45:40.152
...be afraid to fight
for what is yours in this world.

45:46.035 --> 45:49.028
Listen, guys, I'm not going to lie to you.

45:49.705 --> 45:54.075
Things at the moment are getting tough.

45:55.544 --> 45:59.834
Someday, I won't be here to look after you.

46:00.007 --> 46:02.340
And one of you might be running the <i>familia.</i>

46:02.510 --> 46:04.627
But I can assure you this.

46:04.804 --> 46:06.716
If your enemies...

46:06.889 --> 46:08.972
...smell fear...

46:09.141 --> 46:11.224
...they will kill you dead.

46:11.394 --> 46:13.135
Understood?

46:20.278 --> 46:22.861
The Americans are hunting you.

46:24.240 --> 46:26.948
We are too big to fail, man.

46:28.244 --> 46:30.452
This is my ambition.

46:30.788 --> 46:32.370
Like an American bank.

46:32.790 --> 46:37.785
So powerful they can't let
anything happen to us.

46:38.254 --> 46:39.745
And we're close to it.

46:39.922 --> 46:43.131
There's only two more routes
in Central America that we don't control.

46:43.301 --> 46:49.013
Once we do, everything that crosses
the border will have to do with us.

46:51.475 --> 46:54.092
There's that son of a bitch.

46:54.270 --> 46:57.479
Put a kill order on the American sniper.

46:58.232 --> 47:02.067
I want every asset we have gunning
for that son of a bitch.

47:07.241 --> 47:09.073
Hey, Diablo.

47:12.371 --> 47:14.658
Hello, Diablo.

47:16.208 --> 47:17.369
Listen...

47:18.919 --> 47:21.457
...next time you drop by...

47:21.630 --> 47:23.747
...ask first, all right?

47:25.634 --> 47:27.671
Where's my fucking money?

47:35.811 --> 47:39.725
That Marine scout sniper is still alive.

47:40.941 --> 47:44.480
You were paid to kill him,
so your money is back in the safe.

47:44.653 --> 47:48.112
Fuck you. I shot him.

47:49.241 --> 47:51.824
Listen, Diablito.

47:53.079 --> 47:55.787
You're not needed anymore.

47:57.666 --> 48:00.158
Take some vacation, all right?

48:04.048 --> 48:06.415
And get the fuck out of my house.

48:29.323 --> 48:30.609
<i>So, what's your truth?</i>

48:32.118 --> 48:35.202
- My truth?
- Yeah, your story.

48:35.830 --> 48:39.699
I'm concerned. Ever since you got here,
I've got a target on my back.

48:39.875 --> 48:41.457
Don't lay that on me.

48:41.627 --> 48:45.211
You're the one chasing
the bogeyman here, and that's on you.

48:50.928 --> 48:52.544
Estrada.

48:53.472 --> 48:56.215
<i>I've got something for you.</i>

48:56.392 --> 48:58.384
You sure you want it?

49:01.689 --> 49:03.681
Yes, I'm sure.

49:05.651 --> 49:08.610
El Diablo's got a girl he visits.

49:08.779 --> 49:12.523
<i>Maria Ramos. I know where she is right now.</i>

49:16.579 --> 49:18.036
<i>Just be careful.</i>

49:18.205 --> 49:21.073
<i>Morales'</i> familia <i>controls that barrio.</i>

49:21.250 --> 49:23.412
Text me that address.

49:24.253 --> 49:27.837
- Thanks.
- <i>She won't be there for long.</i>

49:34.972 --> 49:37.840
What's the longest you ever hunted a target?

49:39.310 --> 49:42.894
Thirty-six hours with my eye to the scope
before I took the shot.

49:43.063 --> 49:46.898
Well, I've been hunting this guy so long,
I lost track of time.

49:47.067 --> 49:48.603
But you...

49:49.069 --> 49:51.607
...you don't want this job. You never did.

49:51.780 --> 49:54.363
You don't give a shit about me
or my operation.

49:54.533 --> 49:58.072
The only reason you stay is because
someone has a better bullet than you.

49:58.245 --> 49:59.827
Is that what you think?

49:59.997 --> 50:01.909
Yes, it is.

50:12.176 --> 50:13.712
Well, maybe you're right.

50:13.886 --> 50:16.424
Because this bullet is a game-changer.

50:16.931 --> 50:19.719
And that game's bigger than just Morales.

50:19.892 --> 50:21.884
If I'm gonna get this bastard...

50:22.061 --> 50:26.146
...maybe I can't give a shit about you
and your operation right now.

50:26.315 --> 50:27.476
And that's my truth.

50:27.983 --> 50:29.815
So, what's yours?

50:56.220 --> 50:58.928
Kate, go. Get out of here.

52:32.441 --> 52:33.477
What do you want?

52:33.859 --> 52:35.771
- I'm looking for Maria Ramos.
- Oh, my God.

52:37.863 --> 52:39.354
<i>Hola,</i> sexy.

52:43.661 --> 52:45.778
Get out of here.

52:50.876 --> 52:54.369
Just do the smart thing,
and get the fuck out of my face.

52:54.546 --> 52:55.582
Get out of here.

53:08.310 --> 53:11.553
What are you doing
in my fucking barrio, bitch?

54:14.501 --> 54:16.458
Let him go!

54:20.549 --> 54:23.587
You made a big mistake coming here.

54:43.155 --> 54:45.772
I'm done playing games with you.

54:45.949 --> 54:48.407
Gotta go. Now.

54:53.665 --> 54:55.907
No, no, no. No!

54:59.505 --> 55:01.462
You gotta be kidding me.

55:07.346 --> 55:10.510
- Where are you, master sergeant?
- <i>We got a line on Morales's sniper.</i>

55:10.682 --> 55:14.471
We got a photograph of him from his girl.
I'm sending you a picture of him now.

55:18.357 --> 55:19.598
Yeah, we just got it.

55:19.775 --> 55:21.437
I need an ID, master guns.

55:21.610 --> 55:24.478
<i>See if you can figure out who this fucker is.</i>

55:24.655 --> 55:26.692
<i>But there's a bigger problem.</i>

55:27.199 --> 55:30.818
Someone has our talk. We were
ambushed on the way to the black site.

55:31.286 --> 55:33.653
I'm going dark
until I can puzzle this thing out.

55:34.164 --> 55:35.780
<i>No one can know where we are.</i>

55:35.958 --> 55:37.540
Right, but...

55:41.755 --> 55:43.371
Okay, people. Listen up.

55:43.549 --> 55:47.133
I need facial recognition
on this <i>cabrón</i> right here.

55:47.302 --> 55:49.794
I want reports
from all of our border crossings.

55:49.972 --> 55:51.804
Top priority.

55:51.974 --> 55:54.307
You're gonna let Brandon
and Estrada run loose?

55:54.476 --> 55:55.933
Yeah. We let them down.

55:56.103 --> 55:59.767
And now they're gonna get
the best logistics and intel we can provide.

55:59.940 --> 56:04.856
- He's going off the grid until he's satisfied.
- It's not your son's operation, Beckett.

56:05.028 --> 56:06.894
Oh, it is now.

56:13.787 --> 56:15.528
Somebody knows every move we make.

56:23.005 --> 56:24.667
Trust no one.

56:24.840 --> 56:26.581
Exactly.

56:26.758 --> 56:28.249
Let's move.

56:32.389 --> 56:35.598
- What?
- I can take us somewhere safe.

56:38.020 --> 56:39.556
Let's go.

57:10.302 --> 57:11.543
<i>Hola,</i> Kate.

57:12.930 --> 57:16.674
This is Brandon Beckett.
We're working together.

57:16.850 --> 57:19.058
Father Carlos.

57:19.227 --> 57:21.970
- Can we get off the streets?
- Yes, follow me.

57:23.315 --> 57:25.147
Let's go.

57:27.819 --> 57:30.357
Who does Morales have on the inside?

57:30.530 --> 57:32.396
That is the question.

57:32.574 --> 57:36.534
You must assume he has everyone.

57:37.245 --> 57:42.036
Morales is protected
by thugs and powerful people.

57:43.210 --> 57:46.794
- The worst of the worst.
- If we can take some of them out...

57:46.964 --> 57:49.502
...it might force him
and his sniper to act atypically.

57:50.092 --> 57:52.209
And make a mistake.

57:55.263 --> 57:57.004
Yeah. Maybe.

57:57.474 --> 58:01.343
Morales depends on his <i>familia.</i>

58:01.728 --> 58:03.344
Then help us, Father.

58:03.522 --> 58:05.229
Lead us to them.

58:13.073 --> 58:15.611
What the hell happened down there,
master guns?

58:15.784 --> 58:17.992
Yeah, we're looking at it now.

58:18.495 --> 58:22.614
<i>Three bodies found this morning alone.</i>
<i>All of them part of Morales's operation.</i>

58:22.791 --> 58:25.329
<i>And all of them sniper kills.</i>

58:27.963 --> 58:32.458
<i>Jorge Maroquin, Morales's banker, found</i>
<i>dead at his desk in the morning hours.</i>

58:33.093 --> 58:36.803
<i>Miguel Kemper, the torturer,</i>
<i>taken down in broad daylight.</i>

58:39.599 --> 58:43.559
<i>And Johnny Morillo, Morales's top enforcer.</i>

58:45.230 --> 58:47.938
<i>He's that guy we know</i>
<i>for dumping his victims in a landfill.</i>

58:50.152 --> 58:52.895
<i>Only this time, Morillo's the one</i>
<i>with the hole in the head.</i>

58:54.865 --> 58:58.484
<i>If this is Brandon,</i>
<i>his kill list is starting to get out of hand.</i>

58:59.745 --> 59:01.281
Target down.

59:29.316 --> 59:30.602
Come on.

59:30.776 --> 59:33.063
Take a walk with me.

59:54.549 --> 59:56.461
Before I came here...

59:57.385 --> 01:00:00.048
...I watched a fellow Marine get buried.

01:00:01.014 --> 01:00:02.880
He killed himself.

01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:05.432
He was a hero...

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:08.015
...whose past caught up with him.

01:00:08.188 --> 01:00:11.306
Maybe he just pulled the trigger
one too many times.

01:00:13.235 --> 01:00:16.228
Sometimes I think that's my future too.

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:20.610
I don't wanna become him.

01:00:21.952 --> 01:00:25.116
But I wonder, how can it end any other way?

01:00:26.039 --> 01:00:28.247
There is one way.

01:00:28.416 --> 01:00:30.999
And that is forgiveness.

01:00:34.589 --> 01:00:38.799
You must forgive yourself for moral injuries.

01:00:40.679 --> 01:00:42.136
Yeah.

01:00:44.391 --> 01:00:47.384
I too have taken lives.

01:00:48.395 --> 01:00:51.103
I grew up on these streets.

01:00:51.273 --> 01:00:54.266
This is where I learned to hate...

01:00:54.442 --> 01:00:56.855
...the rival gangs.

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:04.905
I have seen many friends die on the streets.

01:01:06.121 --> 01:01:08.579
I'm not proud of who I was.

01:01:08.748 --> 01:01:12.492
But I chose a different life, and so can you.

01:01:13.628 --> 01:01:16.712
Your sins are those of an ordinary man...

01:01:16.882 --> 01:01:19.374
...in a sin-filled world.

01:01:20.635 --> 01:01:24.754
And sins can be absolved.

01:01:35.442 --> 01:01:38.401
You see, it's not nice to sneak in.

01:01:39.154 --> 01:01:42.067
- What do you want?
- We have a situation.

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:45.278
I need you to put the gun away and listen.

01:01:55.462 --> 01:01:57.454
I'm listening.

01:01:59.341 --> 01:02:01.207
I'm sure you've heard.

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:03.797
Beckett is causing me headaches.

01:02:04.888 --> 01:02:06.845
I'm losing men...

01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:09.636
...and patience.

01:02:09.809 --> 01:02:12.677
So? You fired me.

01:02:13.688 --> 01:02:16.351
Let's not argue.

01:02:16.524 --> 01:02:20.359
You missed him once. I missed him once.

01:02:20.987 --> 01:02:26.528
But to you and I,
Beckett's death has great value.

01:02:26.701 --> 01:02:28.738
Too much heat and not enough upside.

01:02:31.665 --> 01:02:36.877
In fact, there's 500,000 upsides.

01:02:37.712 --> 01:02:40.204
Plus 500,000...

01:02:40.382 --> 01:02:43.045
...when he and Estrada are killed.

01:02:45.804 --> 01:02:47.170
All right, soldier.

01:02:54.062 --> 01:02:58.056
We got a hit. Harbormaster's office
in Caracas, Venezuela.

01:02:58.233 --> 01:03:01.192
- We think he's Panamanian.
- <i>I don't care what you think, Samson.</i>

01:03:01.361 --> 01:03:04.149
<i>I wanna know</i>
<i>what the facial-recognition software says.</i>

01:03:04.322 --> 01:03:07.030
The software is at 93 percent affirmative.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.817
- <i>I'll take 93 percent.</i>
- Ex-Defense Force sniper.

01:03:09.995 --> 01:03:14.786
- Did some killing for a son of Noriega.
- His name is Enrique Quintero.

01:03:14.958 --> 01:03:16.790
<i>Where'd he come in from?</i>

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:21.250
From Venezuela, he crossed
the eastern border of Colombia...

01:03:21.423 --> 01:03:24.131
...at a small border post called Cúcuta.

01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:27.294
That was nine months ago,
and then the trail just stops.

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:28.836
We'll send you all this.

01:03:29.431 --> 01:03:30.672
<i>Any word from Brandon?</i>

01:03:30.849 --> 01:03:33.057
No, but the State Department's
been all over me.

01:03:33.601 --> 01:03:36.093
- This isn't the way it was scripted.
- <i>Really?</i>

01:03:36.271 --> 01:03:37.978
<i>That's funny, they haven't called me.</i>

01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:41.141
The State Department and
Homeland Security work side by side...

01:03:41.318 --> 01:03:43.150
...but our agendas don't always sync up.

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:46.404
Homeland considers terrorists
the greater threat. Bombs, not drugs.

01:03:46.573 --> 01:03:49.566
That's our priority now.
In order to fight these bastards...

01:03:49.743 --> 01:03:51.575
...we can't have some loose cannon...

01:03:51.745 --> 01:03:54.283
...starting a street war
with La Familia de Seis.

01:03:54.456 --> 01:03:57.119
So, what are you suggesting here, John?

01:03:57.292 --> 01:04:00.251
What I'm suggesting is,
we round up Brandon and Estrada.

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:04.130
We get them on a plane out of here
before bad turns to worse.

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:09.385
<i>Master Sergeant Beckett and</i>
<i>Agent Estrada are moving the needle.</i>

01:04:09.846 --> 01:04:12.259
<i>I say we give them more time.</i>
<i>What do you say, Tom?</i>

01:04:12.432 --> 01:04:13.764
I agree.

01:04:23.193 --> 01:04:24.855
Are you joking?

01:04:25.445 --> 01:04:28.233
I know Morales is paying great money
for this hit.

01:04:32.911 --> 01:04:34.447
How's 50?

01:04:40.835 --> 01:04:43.794
There's a matching stack when he's dead.

01:04:50.929 --> 01:04:53.137
The word on the streets is...

01:04:53.598 --> 01:04:56.762
...a priest is helping him.

01:04:58.728 --> 01:05:00.936
This word, where is it coming from?

01:05:01.106 --> 01:05:03.098
It's my barrio, remember?

01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:06.809
And there are no secrets to me in <i>mi</i> barrio.

01:05:07.445 --> 01:05:08.731
Okay.

01:05:09.239 --> 01:05:12.732
- Which priest?
- The one called...

01:05:13.618 --> 01:05:14.734
...Father Carlos.

01:05:17.539 --> 01:05:19.326
Give him to me.

01:05:42.063 --> 01:05:45.477
Father Carlos texted me at 7:21 p.m.

01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:49.985
He said, "Meet me at Cortez Square
in front of the church at 10 p.m."

01:05:50.947 --> 01:05:52.813
I called twice.

01:05:52.991 --> 01:05:54.983
He hasn't responded.

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:57.823
- Then something's not right.
- Yeah.

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:19.389
El Diablo's here, somewhere.

01:06:39.037 --> 01:06:40.528
Here.

01:06:49.214 --> 01:06:51.080
What tactics will he use?

01:06:53.718 --> 01:06:55.960
Surveillance, decoys.

01:06:56.137 --> 01:06:59.551
He'll try to draw us out, but we'll hold.

01:07:00.016 --> 01:07:01.848
Until when?

01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:04.927
Until it's time not to.

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:14.478
Anything?

01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:16.989
Nothing real.

01:07:29.837 --> 01:07:30.873
Southwest corner.

01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:34.498
Panel van.

01:07:34.676 --> 01:07:36.087
Blacked-out windows.

01:07:43.851 --> 01:07:46.184
This guy's better than that.

01:08:18.553 --> 01:08:20.215
Where the hell is he?

01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:23.593
He's doing what snipers do, Kate.

01:08:24.058 --> 01:08:26.640
His training's no different than mine.

01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:31.096
El Diablo's a soldier,
hired by a drug kingpin.

01:08:31.691 --> 01:08:32.852
There's someone else.

01:08:33.443 --> 01:08:36.060
There's someone bigger than Morales.

01:08:45.662 --> 01:08:46.870
I got something.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.241
Off scope.

01:08:50.417 --> 01:08:54.037
Behind the truck, what are they doing?

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:02.924
You see that kid?

01:09:05.350 --> 01:09:07.966
He was one of the bangers
at Maria's apartment.

01:09:08.895 --> 01:09:10.602
I remember.

01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:17.192
- Father Carlos.
- No, Kate. It's a trap.

01:09:17.362 --> 01:09:19.694
- He's trying to draw us out.
- Let me the fuck go!

01:09:22.575 --> 01:09:26.068
You go out there, you're dead,
and that is exactly what he wants.

01:09:38.006 --> 01:09:41.421
Where are you, bitches?

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:48.223
He's out there, Kate. Find him.

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:53.804
Come on. Give me a sign.

01:09:56.943 --> 01:09:59.185
We're gonna be too late.

01:09:59.904 --> 01:10:01.020
He's dying.

01:10:01.197 --> 01:10:02.779
No emotion.

01:10:02.949 --> 01:10:04.315
In control.

01:10:04.701 --> 01:10:06.112
That's how we do our job.

01:10:06.285 --> 01:10:08.493
There's no time for that shit. Do something.

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:23.042
- Missed. Shoot again.
- Fuck.

01:12:30.596 --> 01:12:32.178
Hey!

01:12:50.408 --> 01:12:51.649
You work for Morales.

01:13:05.798 --> 01:13:09.257
He killed Father Carlos. Your priest.

01:13:21.439 --> 01:13:23.351
Help us make this right.

01:13:23.524 --> 01:13:25.891
Tell us where he's hiding.

01:13:30.698 --> 01:13:33.611
If I tell you that, I won't last the night.

01:13:35.202 --> 01:13:36.534
We'll protect you.

01:14:29.924 --> 01:14:32.007
<i>Hola,</i> Jesús.

01:14:33.511 --> 01:14:36.094
You finally made a mistake.

01:14:36.263 --> 01:14:38.095
You killed a priest.

01:14:38.265 --> 01:14:39.927
Why don't you kill me, bitch?

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:42.846
That would be too easy.

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:50.609
Besides you, who does El Diablo work for?

01:14:50.778 --> 01:14:54.021
I'll talk when I have a deal. All right, man?

01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:59.659
U.S. Attorney General's office
wants him flown to Miami...

01:14:59.829 --> 01:15:02.913
...to be arraigned
at the federal courthouse there.

01:15:03.082 --> 01:15:04.664
We got a plane waiting for you.

01:15:07.294 --> 01:15:09.877
You guys actually pulled it off. Well done.

01:15:10.047 --> 01:15:13.506
There's no way El Diablo will let
Morales make it to the courthouse.

01:15:14.051 --> 01:15:16.338
He knows too much.

01:15:17.054 --> 01:15:18.465
Yeah.

01:15:18.639 --> 01:15:21.052
Well, I'll see you two in Miami.

01:15:45.249 --> 01:15:47.332
Passport?

01:15:59.555 --> 01:16:01.421
Welcome to Miami, Mr. Garcia.

01:16:01.599 --> 01:16:03.306
Thank you.

01:16:03.934 --> 01:16:06.426
Next. Please have your passport ready.

01:16:06.979 --> 01:16:09.687
No problem in Immigration.

01:16:10.691 --> 01:16:13.183
Everything else in place?

01:16:43.057 --> 01:16:47.346
He sees those charges at the arraignment
and then he'll start talking.

01:16:47.895 --> 01:16:50.387
Hearing is at 1400.

01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:54.892
That gives El Diablo time.

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:23.553
Before I forget...

01:17:23.722 --> 01:17:28.012
...I just wanna let both of you know
what a splendid job I think you've done.

01:17:28.185 --> 01:17:31.098
It's not done yet.
We started this, and we'll finish it.

01:17:31.272 --> 01:17:32.979
Spoken like a true Marine.

01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:35.232
Miller.

01:17:35.401 --> 01:17:37.939
- How are you?
- Good to see you, master guns.

01:17:38.112 --> 01:17:40.650
Just in time for the action.

01:17:55.004 --> 01:17:57.212
<i>Okay, so take us through this again, guns.</i>

01:17:57.381 --> 01:17:59.668
<i>As I said in my assessment...</i>

01:17:59.842 --> 01:18:02.676
...if I was El Diablo,
I would take Morales out...

01:18:02.845 --> 01:18:05.132
...30 seconds after leaving the base.

01:18:05.598 --> 01:18:08.215
<i>That would be unexpected...</i>

01:18:08.392 --> 01:18:11.009
<i>...and also very daring.</i>

01:18:11.604 --> 01:18:12.890
<i>Totally agree.</i>

01:18:13.063 --> 01:18:14.645
How about that right there?

01:18:14.815 --> 01:18:18.183
See, you got wide-open fire lanes,
plenty of operational space...

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:21.398
...minimal civilian traffic.
It's focused on a single exit point.

01:18:21.906 --> 01:18:23.738
<i>Just saying.</i>

01:18:24.825 --> 01:18:28.034
<i>Yeah, it's the perfect location.</i>

01:18:28.621 --> 01:18:31.489
<i>We have vantage over both places</i>
<i>while maintaining cover.</i>

01:18:32.666 --> 01:18:35.249
We see him, and no one's the wiser.

01:18:40.758 --> 01:18:43.592
<i>Some pretty fancy hardware we're up against.</i>

01:18:43.761 --> 01:18:45.502
DARPA rechecked their inventory...

01:18:45.679 --> 01:18:48.342
...found about a hundred
of these bad boys missing.

01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:51.433
Somebody's got their hands in the cookie jar.

01:18:51.602 --> 01:18:54.561
I got some friends in Defense R and D...

01:18:54.730 --> 01:18:57.347
...so I thought we'd level the playing field.

01:18:59.985 --> 01:19:04.150
Naval Research Lab flew these in
from their facility in Chesapeake Beach.

01:19:06.325 --> 01:19:07.361
What's it do?

01:19:07.534 --> 01:19:09.901
Cartridge explodes at pre-selected distance.

01:19:10.079 --> 01:19:11.786
Like a rifle-fired artillery shell?

01:19:11.956 --> 01:19:15.825
Yeah, but only cooler because
the range-finder talks to the bullet...

01:19:16.001 --> 01:19:19.039
...bullet talks to target,
target talks to God.

01:19:20.256 --> 01:19:21.918
All right, kids, back in the fridge.

01:19:22.091 --> 01:19:24.174
Home fries on deck.

01:19:26.011 --> 01:19:27.673
My guys will take the last vehicle.

01:19:27.846 --> 01:19:30.133
- Cover the rear.
- That's awesome. Thanks a lot, Bob.

01:19:31.225 --> 01:19:32.932
- John.
- John.

01:19:33.102 --> 01:19:34.513
That's right.

01:19:35.312 --> 01:19:38.726
Half past 12. Time to move.

01:20:19.356 --> 01:20:20.597
Get in there.

01:20:49.428 --> 01:20:52.421
I still think the shit's gonna go down
outside the courthouse.

01:20:52.598 --> 01:20:55.090
More diversions, easier exits.

01:20:55.267 --> 01:20:57.850
Look, the convoy's a decoy.

01:20:58.020 --> 01:20:59.181
Wait a second.

01:20:59.355 --> 01:21:02.564
If the guy with the hood on is a fake,
where's the real Morales?

01:21:02.733 --> 01:21:05.020
He rolls out later in a dry-cleaner's van.

01:21:05.194 --> 01:21:09.234
Nice. Smart play, but a little heads-up
next time would be better.

01:21:09.406 --> 01:21:12.444
I thought the JATF is all about
interagency cooperation.

01:21:12.951 --> 01:21:15.364
It is. Let's hit the roof.

01:21:17.081 --> 01:21:19.118
Rolling Thunder, go.

01:21:19.625 --> 01:21:22.618
<i>Copy that. Rolling Thunder on the move.</i>

01:21:22.795 --> 01:21:25.412
<i>Copy, Romeo Tango.</i>

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:45.565
Yeah, we in position. Where you guys at?

01:21:49.530 --> 01:21:51.396
Yeah, we're good.

01:22:43.667 --> 01:22:45.158
Here they come.

01:22:50.799 --> 01:22:52.165
Any sign of El Diablo?

01:22:52.593 --> 01:22:54.334
Not yet.

01:22:55.179 --> 01:22:58.172
I'll clock the convoy, you take perimeter.

01:23:25.125 --> 01:23:26.957
Convoy clear.

01:23:27.127 --> 01:23:28.538
El Diablo was a no-show.

01:23:30.214 --> 01:23:31.375
Here comes the van.

01:23:31.965 --> 01:23:33.877
Remain on standby.

01:23:34.051 --> 01:23:36.043
Is that really necessary, Richard?

01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:40.214
I thought the whole point of a decoy was
to throw the bad guys off the scent.

01:23:40.933 --> 01:23:42.720
Better safe than sorry, John.

01:23:51.485 --> 01:23:53.101
Okay, let's go.

01:24:06.333 --> 01:24:09.451
Black sedan, inbound from the north,
100 feet from the intersection.

01:24:09.628 --> 01:24:11.665
- Moving fast.
- There's a surprise, Samson.

01:24:14.633 --> 01:24:16.716
Incoming from the south. Old Cadillac.

01:24:16.885 --> 01:24:19.719
Moving at high speed, gaining on the van.

01:24:20.347 --> 01:24:23.966
Got it. Keep searching for El Diablo,
I'll take care of this.

01:24:24.142 --> 01:24:25.974
- Copy that, sir.
- All units...

01:24:26.144 --> 01:24:28.932
...bogeys approaching
from the north and south.

01:24:42.578 --> 01:24:43.614
There you go.

01:24:43.787 --> 01:24:45.153
- Where is he?
- Searching.

01:24:46.206 --> 01:24:47.822
Let me see if I can draw him out.

01:25:15.986 --> 01:25:18.729
Elevated walkway, 12 o'clock.
Confirm hole in window.

01:25:19.698 --> 01:25:22.156
Distance locked, but I can't see him.

01:25:22.326 --> 01:25:23.612
Not a problem.

01:25:42.346 --> 01:25:43.928
Assume position clear.

01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:48.136
Target down.

01:26:01.865 --> 01:26:04.778
Welcome to Miami, Jesús.

01:26:32.187 --> 01:26:34.679
There's nobody in the fucking van.
Where's Morales?

01:26:35.732 --> 01:26:36.848
What the hell is this?

01:26:39.528 --> 01:26:41.315
Remote-control vehicle.

01:26:41.488 --> 01:26:43.821
It's called a decoy, John.

01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:48.030
For catching an enemy sniper
and rogue Homeland Security agents...

01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:50.486
...in cahoots with Morales.

01:26:50.664 --> 01:26:52.951
You just can't make this stuff up.

01:26:56.503 --> 01:26:59.587
Supposition, not fact.

01:26:59.756 --> 01:27:01.497
You want facts, John?

01:27:01.675 --> 01:27:04.213
I had my boys at Langley clone
your burner phone.

01:27:04.386 --> 01:27:06.173
It's all here in black and white.

01:27:06.596 --> 01:27:09.589
We got copies of every text you sent.

01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:13.343
You're pinging Morales and Diablo
like a teenage crush.

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:15.352
You're blowing him through Customs...

01:27:15.522 --> 01:27:19.141
...you're telegraphing our movements,
putting our people in harm's way.

01:27:19.317 --> 01:27:20.603
We got him. Come on up.

01:27:20.777 --> 01:27:23.815
I told Garza to abort
the farmhouse operation.

01:27:23.989 --> 01:27:27.949
- And I warned you, pull your guys out.
- Yeah, after you tried to kill Estrada.

01:27:28.118 --> 01:27:30.531
Garza is dead because of you.

01:27:31.371 --> 01:27:33.203
You helped this man.

01:27:38.044 --> 01:27:39.580
Morales...

01:27:39.755 --> 01:27:42.964
...was our best chance to stop
a dirty bomb from crossing the border.

01:27:43.133 --> 01:27:45.625
That was the deal in return
for giving him the weapon.

01:27:45.802 --> 01:27:49.386
It was never meant
to be used against our people.

01:27:49.556 --> 01:27:52.390
If we can eliminate his rivals
in return for a guarantee...

01:27:52.559 --> 01:27:56.303
...as to what comes into this country?
Yeah, so be it!

01:27:56.980 --> 01:27:59.723
People died, Samson. Good people.

01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:01.766
That's on you, asshole.

01:28:15.540 --> 01:28:18.203
- So long, Bob.
- Let's go.

01:28:20.086 --> 01:28:22.578
As much as I'd love
to celebrate with you people...

01:28:22.756 --> 01:28:24.793
...Washington is pulling me back.

01:28:25.592 --> 01:28:27.584
Master guns.

01:28:29.054 --> 01:28:30.841
- GS-9 Miller.
- Oh, nice.

01:28:31.473 --> 01:28:34.341
- Estrada, great job.
- Thanks.

01:28:36.269 --> 01:28:39.512
Master sergeant, great job.
I'll miss you most of all, Scarecrow.

01:28:40.232 --> 01:28:43.646
- Thanks for everything, Miller.
- You know it. You all right?

01:28:43.819 --> 01:28:46.232
- You all right? You all right?
- I'm good.

01:28:46.404 --> 01:28:48.896
Okay. I knew you're not a quitter.

01:28:49.074 --> 01:28:50.906
Semper fi, buddy.

01:28:54.621 --> 01:28:57.534
You guys did a hell of a job.
You're a good team.

01:28:57.707 --> 01:29:00.745
You think you'll work together again, maybe?

01:29:02.087 --> 01:29:04.830
You mean, babysitting the DEA?

01:29:05.006 --> 01:29:06.417
Best job you ever had.

01:29:06.591 --> 01:29:09.049
Oh, God. Don't start, please.

01:29:09.636 --> 01:29:12.344
Well, I'm going fishing. What else?

01:29:13.348 --> 01:29:16.887
Someplace safe like Puget Sound
in Washington State, Brandon.

01:29:27.487 --> 01:29:29.774
Keep your powder dry.

01:29:31.575 --> 01:29:32.941
You got my cell number, right?

01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:37.863
Give me a call sometime.
You wanna go fishing?

01:29:38.039 --> 01:29:39.405
Let me know, yeah?

01:29:54.431 --> 01:29:56.013
Master guns.
