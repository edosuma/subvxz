"This film is partly based on a true story yet characters
and plots portrayed in this production are fictitious."

01:02.375 --> 01:04.455
"The script is re-created
instead of a real record."

02:40.500 --> 02:43.242
"2002, Shanghai"

02:54.000 --> 02:56.867
"Indian god qil shop"

02:59.958 --> 03:01.164
Cheng

03:02.000 --> 03:03.410
welcome.

03:04.542 --> 03:06.453
The landlord called me once again

03:06.458 --> 03:07.948
I told him your shop wasn't open yet.

03:08.333 --> 03:09.072
Thanks.

03:09.250 --> 03:10.706
Try to pay up the rent.

03:10.708 --> 03:12.994
I can't cos I'm broke.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.615
My products are not selling well.

03:15.417 --> 03:17.499
Have you put in your guesthouse
the oil I gave you last time?

03:17.500 --> 03:18.285
Yes, I have.

03:18.292 --> 03:19.327
But nobody used it.

03:19.458 --> 03:20.493
People use Viagra nowadays.

03:20.500 --> 03:21.615
Nobody would use it.

03:21.708 --> 03:22.993
I tried it once.

03:23.542 --> 03:24.748
Doesn't really help.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.490
It's your own impotence to blame.

03:42.125 --> 03:43.331
Bitch!

03:43.333 --> 03:45.870
How dare she call me again!

03:47.250 --> 03:48.330
I've had enough.

03:48.333 --> 03:49.948
Ok, let me do it.

03:52.792 --> 03:53.998
What's going on?

03:55.083 --> 03:56.198
Let me tell you.

03:56.542 --> 03:59.204
No one is to take my grandson away!

03:59.208 --> 04:00.618
Alright alright!

04:01.125 --> 04:03.036
Just don't pick up if she calls again.

04:03.167 --> 04:04.373
She is driving me mad.

04:04.375 --> 04:05.535
No need to be upset.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.703
Cigarette.

04:11.750 --> 04:13.115
You are not done with your meal yet.

04:13.125 --> 04:14.160
No cigarette.

04:17.166 --> 04:18.327
Open your mouth.

04:22.083 --> 04:23.443
You'd better take him to a doctor.

04:23.583 --> 04:24.583
No need.

04:24.833 --> 04:26.033
Hospitals just want our money.

04:26.125 --> 04:27.726
They will probably make something up
if you are not sick.

04:27.750 --> 04:29.115
He has speaking problems.

04:29.125 --> 04:30.535
What if he becomes paralyzed?

04:30.583 --> 04:31.583
Don't worry.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.491
He just drank too much when he was young.

04:36.208 --> 04:36.993
Listen.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.490
Next time you'd better pay by year.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.122
Swim over there.

04:53.208 --> 04:54.744
To that side. Go.

04:58.667 --> 05:01.500
Daddy, it hurts.

05:03.042 --> 05:04.157
Keep still.

05:10.917 --> 05:11.997
I'm your dad.

05:12.042 --> 05:13.042
Hands off.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.702
Pipi is getting bigger huh?

05:22.333 --> 05:23.823
You asked for buns yourself.

05:23.833 --> 05:25.164
Why do you only eat the dough?

05:25.167 --> 05:26.373
I don't like the filling.

05:27.500 --> 05:28.159
Daddy?

05:28.167 --> 05:28.701
Yes?

05:28.875 --> 05:30.331
I want a pair of sneakers.

05:30.708 --> 05:31.413
How much?

05:31.417 --> 05:32.417
260.

05:39.167 --> 05:40.782
Why don't you ask your stepfather?

05:40.792 --> 05:41.952
Just don't want to.

05:50.417 --> 05:51.281
Take it.

05:51.292 --> 05:52.372
Thanks, daddy.

05:54.667 --> 05:56.157
Spend it right, okay?

06:01.667 --> 06:02.656
I'll see you next week.

06:02.667 --> 06:03.667
Ok.

06:12.375 --> 06:13.535
Have you thought it over?

06:13.542 --> 06:14.998
No way.

06:16.958 --> 06:18.619
And don't ever call my dad again.

06:18.625 --> 06:19.705
What do you want from him?

06:19.708 --> 06:21.824
Ok, my attorney will talk to you.

06:21.833 --> 06:23.323
No one can change my mind.

06:23.667 --> 06:25.032
Do you hear me?

06:25.917 --> 06:27.327
That's not gonna happen!

06:28.292 --> 06:30.453
Mr. Cheng, anyway,

06:30.458 --> 06:33.575
going aboard will be the
best choice for your kid.

06:33.583 --> 06:35.915
Cat got your tongue?
Why is someone else speaking for you?

06:35.917 --> 06:36.906
Mr. Cheng.

06:36.917 --> 06:39.203
Ms. cao could offer you some compensation.

06:39.208 --> 06:40.914
And the amount is negotiable.

06:40.917 --> 06:42.623
What are you talking about?

06:43.125 --> 06:44.331
Are you asking me to sell my son?

06:44.333 --> 06:46.824
We are clear about your
financial situation.

06:46.833 --> 06:49.575
Even if he stays with you,
you can't afford raising him.

06:49.583 --> 06:51.323
Ms. cao is actually giving you a hand.

06:51.500 --> 06:52.956
I don't need her help.

06:52.958 --> 06:54.289
You think money is a big deal?

06:54.292 --> 06:55.532
Is that your own money?

06:55.542 --> 06:56.531
Now look, Mr. Cheng

06:56.542 --> 06:57.577
Cheng yong.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.282
Can't you be less selfish?

06:59.292 --> 07:01.704
Listen, I am Cheng xiaoshu's father!

07:02.083 --> 07:03.948
Don't ever think about taking him abroad!

07:04.208 --> 07:06.745
Father? Seriously, what
kind of father are you?

07:06.750 --> 07:08.456
Have you ever shouldered
any responsibility for him?

07:08.458 --> 07:10.164
What sense does it make
for him to stay with you?

07:10.167 --> 07:12.453
To sell heathcare products
like you when he grows up?

07:12.958 --> 07:14.289
What did you say?

07:15.125 --> 07:16.410
Don't give me this look.

07:16.583 --> 07:19.120
I'll take you to court if you don't agree.

07:19.208 --> 07:20.789
Are you threatening me?

07:20.917 --> 07:22.453
You'd better believe I'll punch you.

07:23.542 --> 07:25.578
Of course I believe it.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Haven't you thrown enough
punches all these years?

07:28.875 --> 07:30.206
Listen, Cheng yong.

07:30.833 --> 07:31.833
I'm not afraid of you.

07:32.375 --> 07:34.661
In my mind you are not a man.

07:36.583 --> 07:37.663
Calm down, Mr. Cheng.

07:37.667 --> 07:38.656
Get out.

07:38.667 --> 07:39.452
How can you be so rude?

07:39.458 --> 07:39.992
So what?

07:40.000 --> 07:41.365
I'm warning you. Just stop.

07:41.375 --> 07:42.831
You're warning me huh?

07:43.250 --> 07:45.241
Stop. How dare you hit me?

07:45.250 --> 07:46.786
You can't hit the lawyer!

07:46.792 --> 07:47.792
Beat it!

07:49.125 --> 07:50.125
Ms. cao

07:55.417 --> 07:56.417
Cao sir

07:59.917 --> 08:00.917
cao sir

08:01.250 --> 08:02.250
cao sir

08:02.667 --> 08:03.497
cao sir

08:03.625 --> 08:04.625
calm down.

08:04.833 --> 08:05.833
Cao sir

08:07.125 --> 08:07.864
cao sir

08:07.875 --> 08:08.875
calm down.

08:09.500 --> 08:12.412
If you ever lay a finger on my
sister again, I'll kill you.

08:13.042 --> 08:14.042
Enough.

08:14.333 --> 08:15.333
Let go of me.

08:36.667 --> 08:37.746
Where is my brother-in-law?

08:38.457 --> 08:39.457
On a business trip.

08:44.207 --> 08:45.208
When will you leave?

08:46.583 --> 08:47.583
In two months.

08:48.375 --> 08:49.375
Why don't you go first.

08:50.167 --> 08:51.998
We will figure something out about xiaoshu.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
I'll handle it.

09:00.083 --> 09:01.083
Cheng.

09:01.292 --> 09:02.292
Come over here.

09:03.833 --> 09:04.873
Let me introduce you guys.

09:05.417 --> 09:07.203
My old neighbour, iv shouyi.

09:07.542 --> 09:08.076
Mr. Cheng.

09:08.083 --> 09:09.083
Hello, how are you?

09:09.500 --> 09:10.114
What does he want?

09:10.125 --> 09:13.413
He wants to ask you
to bring some medicine from India.

09:14.292 --> 09:15.202
Bring back medicine?

09:15.208 --> 09:15.947
Smuggling?

09:15.958 --> 09:17.718
Aren't all the stuff you
sell here smuggled?

09:18.542 --> 09:19.702
I'll leave you to it.

09:19.708 --> 09:20.993
Bye.

09:24.500 --> 09:25.860
How could you tell him everything?

09:26.208 --> 09:27.823
I know your business isn't doing well.

09:27.833 --> 09:30.666
I'm giving you business.
Prices are negotiable.

09:31.625 --> 09:32.625
Do it.

09:44.958 --> 09:46.038
Have an orange.

09:46.875 --> 09:48.411
Cut it out.

09:48.417 --> 09:50.658
You know I'll be sent to jail
if I get caught smuggling medicine.

09:50.667 --> 09:51.577
Not that bad.

09:51.583 --> 09:52.743
Not that bad my ass.

09:53.208 --> 09:55.415
Not to mention,
only 30,000 yuan for such high risks?

09:56.167 --> 09:57.767
It's a good business opportunity though.

10:00.583 --> 10:02.976
The generic Indian one is
only 2,000 yuan and they work the same.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.911
If you can bring back more...

10:05.500 --> 10:06.580
They work the same?

10:07.458 --> 10:08.818
With only one twentieth the price?

10:08.917 --> 10:09.917
Go away.

10:10.333 --> 10:12.824
It's real Mr. Cheng. It has
been tried and tested.

10:13.208 --> 10:16.120
I am a patient myself.
I'd go to India myself if I can.

10:16.125 --> 10:18.832
Even if you can't,
don't you have a relative or friend?

10:18.833 --> 10:20.949
Obviously you are just
afraid of being caught.

10:20.958 --> 10:22.448
I won't do it. Ask someone else.

10:22.458 --> 10:24.268
No. I'm sure that you've been
smuggling all this time.

10:24.292 --> 10:25.452
Nonsense.

10:26.042 --> 10:28.124
Listen, I've never ever
smuggled anything before.

10:28.417 --> 10:29.827
No way. Get out of my sight.

10:31.083 --> 10:32.869
I'll leave you my phone number.

10:40.625 --> 10:42.365
Please give me a call

10:42.375 --> 10:44.331
once you change your mind.

10:46.167 --> 10:47.623
I need the drugs to save my life.

10:51.625 --> 10:52.625
See you.

11:19.833 --> 11:22.415
Doctor wang, something seems wrong.

11:23.500 --> 11:24.535
No, nothing.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.115
That's too expensive.

11:28.375 --> 11:30.036
Chong hospital only charges 80,000 yuan.

11:30.042 --> 11:32.158
Then you go to them. Don't stay here.

11:35.792 --> 11:37.532
You are the leading expert.

11:38.125 --> 11:39.706
Your efforts will be appreciated.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.874
The hospital sets the price. Not us.

11:42.875 --> 11:44.240
You need to figure it out asap.

11:44.250 --> 11:45.365
Once the angioma ruptures,

11:45.375 --> 11:46.535
he will be gone.

12:52.542 --> 12:54.453
"Rent for the key."

13:25.500 --> 13:28.037
Glinic is the most effective medicine
for cml treatment

13:28.042 --> 13:29.522
and it requires a lifelong treatment.

13:29.708 --> 13:31.744
Have you ever heard of Indian glinic?

13:32.750 --> 13:34.331
Who told you that?

13:34.625 --> 13:36.616
I heard of it from other patients.

13:38.167 --> 13:39.577
How does it work?

13:39.792 --> 13:41.248
You shouldn't worry about that.

13:41.250 --> 13:42.660
It's illegal.

13:42.667 --> 13:45.283
Many doctors refuse to treat patients
who self-medicate.

13:45.292 --> 13:46.372
Why?

13:46.375 --> 13:48.832
Who would take reponsibility
if something goes wrong with the patients?

13:48.833 --> 13:50.573
Some patients just can't afford it.

13:50.583 --> 13:51.948
Sorry, there's nothing we can do.

13:51.958 --> 13:54.665
You have no choice but to wait for death
once it advances to cml-bc.

13:56.083 --> 13:57.744
Just bring the patient here.

14:10.125 --> 14:11.706
"Can't pay for cml drugs."

14:14.583 --> 14:16.119
They're coming out.

14:16.958 --> 14:18.869
We protest against
astronomical drug prices!

14:26.167 --> 14:28.203
Quiet everyone. Quiet please.

14:30.625 --> 14:32.286
Keep quiet!

14:32.917 --> 14:34.407
Keep quiet!

14:34.708 --> 14:36.915
Do you want to solve the problem or not?!

14:37.417 --> 14:38.657
Quiet!

14:39.292 --> 14:40.407
Quiet!

14:40.417 --> 14:41.873
Listen to him!

14:42.583 --> 14:43.743
I'm fine, thanks.

14:45.708 --> 14:47.039
Thank you all.

14:47.042 --> 14:48.282
Allow me to say something.

14:48.833 --> 14:49.948
I know

14:50.458 --> 14:53.450
you complain a lot about the price of

14:53.458 --> 14:54.618
our product glinic.

14:54.625 --> 14:58.664
We fully understand what you want.

14:58.667 --> 15:00.783
However, you still need to be clear

15:01.167 --> 15:04.910
that the prices of all our products

15:04.917 --> 15:06.748
are completely rational and legal.

15:06.750 --> 15:08.991
If you don't stop making a scene here,

15:09.000 --> 15:10.740
and disrupt our normal work,

15:10.750 --> 15:11.750
sorry,

15:12.125 --> 15:13.740
we will have no choice
but to call the police.

15:13.750 --> 15:16.207
We are not scared of the cops.
We are dying!

15:16.208 --> 15:17.994
How can you charge so much for the drugs?

15:18.000 --> 15:21.697
Why? Why?

15:23.500 --> 15:25.115
Get rid of them now.

15:27.500 --> 15:28.580
"Protest! I wanna survive!"

15:39.167 --> 15:40.202
Hello?

15:56.042 --> 15:59.705
Can you ensure sales if
I bring the drugs back?

15:59.958 --> 16:01.073
Yes, I can.

16:01.583 --> 16:03.699
There are ten or more patients
in my hospital alone.

16:03.875 --> 16:05.365
There will be no problem.

16:14.083 --> 16:15.118
I can go,

16:17.958 --> 16:19.368
but you need to pay me up front.

16:29.917 --> 16:30.576
Mr. Cheng!

16:30.583 --> 16:31.242
James!

16:31.250 --> 16:32.035
Welcome.

16:32.042 --> 16:33.122
It's so hot here.

16:34.083 --> 16:35.083
James.

16:35.292 --> 16:36.702
Take me there this time.

17:39.375 --> 17:40.375
Only 500 yuan?

17:40.458 --> 17:41.868
Isn't it 2,000 yuan?

17:42.208 --> 17:43.869
That's the retail price in the pharmacy.

17:44.833 --> 17:46.573
Please tell him I need some.

17:46.583 --> 17:47.618
He wants to buy some.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.288
No, we only sell to our
sales representatives.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.865
If you want some, you
can go to the pharmacy.

17:55.333 --> 17:56.869
Do they have a Chinese agent?

17:57.083 --> 17:58.448
Do you have a Chinese agent?

17:58.458 --> 17:59.458
No.

18:00.042 --> 18:01.953
You are the first Chinese man who's come.

18:01.958 --> 18:03.573
I can be the Chinese agent.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.119
He can be your representative.

18:08.167 --> 18:10.328
As far as I know,
our medicine is prohibited in China.

18:10.667 --> 18:13.143
So even if I sell some to him,
he will not be able to sell them.

18:13.167 --> 18:14.407
He doesn't need to worry about it.

18:14.417 --> 18:16.749
I can sell the drugs as
long as he sells me some.

18:19.625 --> 18:20.910
How much do you want?

18:21.125 --> 18:22.331
100 bottles.

18:24.125 --> 18:25.740
I know that's not as much as he's expected,

18:25.750 --> 18:27.581
while this time I can
only afford this much.

18:27.750 --> 18:30.241
But I can assure you that
I will definitely buy much more next time.

18:30.250 --> 18:31.250
Really?

18:32.875 --> 18:34.081
Why should I trust you?

18:34.083 --> 18:36.074
There are a lot of patients in China

18:36.083 --> 18:38.449
who cannot afford the genuine medicine.

18:38.667 --> 18:40.703
They are eagerly waiting
for me to bring them back

18:40.708 --> 18:41.948
to save their lives.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.039
So you want to be a saviour?

18:49.000 --> 18:50.615
No, I don't.

18:50.625 --> 18:51.990
I want to make money.

18:52.208 --> 18:55.166
Tell him China is a huge
market for this medicine.

18:55.292 --> 18:58.125
A lot of patients are waiting for
this medicine to save their lives.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.207
Life is money.

19:10.833 --> 19:11.743
Different. Different.

19:11.750 --> 19:12.910
Not different. Not differert.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.285
Dangerous. Dangerous.

19:14.292 --> 19:15.782
No danger. No danger.

19:16.167 --> 19:18.123
Don't speak Indian to me. I can't get it.

19:18.125 --> 19:20.457
Friends. We are friends. Friends.

19:20.583 --> 19:21.743
More money.

19:22.500 --> 19:23.740
More money.

19:24.542 --> 19:26.373
Damn.

19:26.375 --> 19:27.865
You are so cunning.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.365
More, more money.

19:29.875 --> 19:30.830
Still not enough?

19:30.833 --> 19:31.948
Danger. Danger.

19:32.292 --> 19:33.202
Alright all yours.

19:33.208 --> 19:34.493
Ok? Ok?

19:35.500 --> 19:36.956
You are so greedy,

19:36.958 --> 19:38.368
and sly as a fox.

19:38.542 --> 19:40.624
Hurry up, take it on board.

19:44.542 --> 19:45.657
Watch out! I don't want any trouble.

19:45.667 --> 19:47.623
Or I will not hire you next time. Bye.

20:07.625 --> 20:09.331
I'll sell you some portion.

20:09.375 --> 20:13.698
But you'll have to sell that portion
in one month in China.

20:14.125 --> 20:16.116
Only then can I give it to you.

20:27.792 --> 20:29.248
You can't stop taking the drugs.

20:29.667 --> 20:32.374
You are in a bad shape now.
It's been less than a month,

20:32.375 --> 20:33.893
and your platelet count has dropped again.

20:33.917 --> 20:35.828
Come on, doctor, give me a break.

20:38.083 --> 20:39.323
No I don't think so.

20:39.333 --> 20:40.333
I'm telling you,

20:40.583 --> 20:41.823
if you go on like this

20:45.625 --> 20:47.115
how many did you bring back?

20:51.042 --> 20:52.962
The point is we've opened
up the supply channel.

20:53.083 --> 20:55.039
So we will get a continuous supply.

21:00.042 --> 21:01.498
Stop!

21:02.333 --> 21:03.823
We need to sell these first.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.115
Who will sell them?

21:06.125 --> 21:06.864
We.

21:07.042 --> 21:08.042
Bro,

21:08.292 --> 21:10.374
I promised to introduce
some patients to you.

21:10.375 --> 21:11.205
What do you mean?

21:11.250 --> 21:12.456
Selling drugs is illegal.

21:12.458 --> 21:13.538
You gave me your word before!

21:13.542 --> 21:14.156
I can explain

21:14.167 --> 21:15.202
listen.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.412
You'll get drugs and money if you help me.

21:19.042 --> 21:20.452
If you don't...

21:20.792 --> 21:22.032
I'm sorry.

21:30.833 --> 21:32.039
Ok, I'll try.

21:39.792 --> 21:41.123
Booking treatment specialists.

21:43.917 --> 21:45.703
Indian glinic, 5,000 yuan.

21:45.917 --> 21:48.033
I'm a patient and I've tried it myself.

21:51.125 --> 21:51.739
From India.

21:51.750 --> 21:52.750
No no.

21:55.292 --> 21:56.122
It really works.

21:56.125 --> 21:56.955
It treats cml.

21:56.958 --> 21:57.958
Really a steal.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.742
Stop bothering us. My dad is sleeping.

22:07.250 --> 22:08.535
Ma'am, as you can see,

22:08.542 --> 22:10.624
with what you spent on one bottle before,

22:10.625 --> 22:12.411
you can get seven bottles now, right?

22:12.417 --> 22:12.997
Get out!

22:13.000 --> 22:13.739
Why are you pushing me?

22:13.750 --> 22:15.240
I come here for the doctor,
what's the problem?

22:15.250 --> 22:16.160
Watch yourself or I'll report you.

22:16.167 --> 22:18.687
What's wrong with you?
You don't take patients' lives seriously!

22:23.042 --> 22:24.042
Here we are.

22:26.917 --> 22:28.237
- Cml medication.
- Don't need it.

22:29.167 --> 22:29.906
Hello, anybody in there?

22:29.917 --> 22:31.532
Don't need it.

22:31.917 --> 22:33.407
Why swearing at us?

22:33.417 --> 22:34.281
They are from India.

22:34.292 --> 22:36.408
The same efficacy. Do you wanna try?

22:36.500 --> 22:37.500
I don't need it.

22:38.167 --> 22:39.031
It's from India.

22:39.042 --> 22:41.283
I also take it myself.
Totally the same efficacy.

22:42.583 --> 22:44.198
Can I take a free trial for two months?

22:46.125 --> 22:47.706
Can't even sell one bottle, huh?

22:49.042 --> 22:50.873
You big liar.

22:55.375 --> 22:56.080
What's up?

22:56.375 --> 22:57.740
Someone just came to my mind.

22:57.750 --> 22:58.705
Who?

22:58.708 --> 22:59.948
She could help.

23:00.292 --> 23:01.292
Who is she?

23:01.542 --> 23:03.157
The admin of the patients' group chat.

23:03.375 --> 23:05.036
Set up by patients on qq.

23:05.417 --> 23:07.658
All the cml patients are in there.

23:08.042 --> 23:09.703
She is the group admin of hospital no.6.

23:09.708 --> 23:11.744
And she knows all other
group admins in Shanghai.

23:12.167 --> 23:13.167
Here it is.

23:54.292 --> 23:55.292
That's her.

24:11.875 --> 24:14.207
She doesn't look like she is sick.

24:14.208 --> 24:15.208
She is not.

24:16.292 --> 24:17.953
Her daughter is.

24:21.667 --> 24:23.874
It's tried and tested.
Totally the same efficacy.

24:23.875 --> 24:25.831
I've been taking it myself.

24:25.833 --> 24:28.074
I think your daughter can try it as well.

24:28.083 --> 24:29.243
He is here today

24:30.042 --> 24:32.522
to ask you a favour to introduce it
in cml patient chat groups.

24:36.917 --> 24:37.917
Where is she?

24:38.375 --> 24:39.455
Should be here in a minute.

24:41.250 --> 24:42.490
One more basket please.

24:42.667 --> 24:44.373
Boss, one more basket!

24:44.375 --> 24:46.457
You call yourself a patient?
You eat more than me.

24:59.125 --> 25:00.125
Brother yong.

25:00.375 --> 25:01.330
Sorry for being late.

25:01.333 --> 25:02.118
It's a large group.

25:02.125 --> 25:03.125
It took some time.

25:03.417 --> 25:04.406
Here is brother yong.

25:04.417 --> 25:05.657
They are the group admins.

25:06.042 --> 25:07.828
Come on, introduce yourselves.

25:08.417 --> 25:09.577
Zhao bin, erdao hospital.

25:10.542 --> 25:11.907
Zhang jinsong, railway hospital.

25:13.542 --> 25:15.282
Brother yong, my name is fan shuiping.

25:16.833 --> 25:17.833
Brother yong.

25:18.125 --> 25:19.165
Everybody sit down please.

25:19.667 --> 25:20.667
Brother yong.

25:22.708 --> 25:24.068
That's how we will sell the drugs.

25:24.708 --> 25:26.073
Do remember to keep a low profile.

25:26.625 --> 25:28.365
Nobody gets any drugs if things go wrong.

25:28.625 --> 25:29.660
Any questions?

25:32.042 --> 25:33.042
The drug

25:34.042 --> 25:35.322
is still a little bit expensive.

25:35.583 --> 25:39.121
Yes, too expensive.

25:39.917 --> 25:40.997
How can we afford it?

25:41.000 --> 25:42.115
Don't have enough money.

25:42.333 --> 25:43.573
It costs 60,000 yuan a year?

25:43.583 --> 25:45.164
How do I possibly have 60,000 yuan?

25:45.458 --> 25:47.369
I can't make 60,000 a
year no matter what I do.

25:47.625 --> 25:49.456
All right! Enough!

25:51.250 --> 25:53.161
Did I ask for 30,000 or 20,000?

25:53.542 --> 25:55.407
Just 5000. You shouldn't complain.

25:56.083 --> 25:57.368
Then just save it.

25:57.792 --> 26:00.078
Can you take your masks
off when you speak to me?

26:00.375 --> 26:01.990
I can't even tell who you are.

26:02.333 --> 26:03.733
Can't you all show me some respect?

26:04.792 --> 26:05.792
Brother yong,

26:06.375 --> 26:08.855
it will be difficult for them.
This is a bacterial environment.

26:09.208 --> 26:10.539
Bacterial environment?

26:10.750 --> 26:12.115
Ok, keep them on.

26:42.833 --> 26:44.793
A 20% discount for you
guys is the best I can do.

26:48.833 --> 26:50.039
There are many names here.

26:51.875 --> 26:53.911
The drugs are not enough.
We need some more.

26:54.708 --> 26:56.448
Do you know any patient
who can speak english?

26:56.458 --> 26:57.447
There is one.

26:57.458 --> 26:58.789
I need a very fluent speaker.

27:00.875 --> 27:02.536
But it might be tough to persuade him.

27:02.542 --> 27:07.957
Jesus travelled all the
cities and villages,

27:07.958 --> 27:09.949
teaching in training hall,

27:09.958 --> 27:14.782
to preach the gospel of
the kingdom of heaven

27:14.792 --> 27:20.367
and cure of disease,
heal so many people, pity them.

27:20.792 --> 27:21.792
Amen.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.410
Amen.

27:23.833 --> 27:25.698
I'm a Christian.

27:26.292 --> 27:28.829
I can't do anything illegal.

27:28.833 --> 27:30.289
Didn't god say,

27:31.167 --> 27:33.643
"there is greater merit in saving one life
than in building a seven-tier pagoda.”

27:33.667 --> 27:34.907
That's what the Buddha said.

27:35.375 --> 27:36.455
Same thing.

27:36.833 --> 27:38.323
You are a patient yourself.

27:38.583 --> 27:40.539
You know how much the real drugs cost.

27:40.917 --> 27:43.283
Can they get medicine
besides praying to god?

27:43.625 --> 27:45.345
How many patients die of cml here annually?

27:45.500 --> 27:47.115
It's about life and death.

27:47.125 --> 27:49.537
There's nothing wrong to save lives
even we crossed the line.

27:50.708 --> 27:51.948
God says,

27:52.625 --> 27:54.490
"if I don't go to hell, who will?"

27:54.833 --> 27:56.073
That's from the Buddha too.

27:56.083 --> 27:57.448
Can you just shut up?

27:59.625 --> 28:02.332
I'll sell the drugs. And you interpret.

28:02.583 --> 28:04.164
I guarantee your potion.

28:04.167 --> 28:06.408
And I'll give every patient
in your church a 20% discount.

28:06.417 --> 28:08.703
That's truly peace in the lord.

28:09.333 --> 28:10.333
Amen.

28:14.208 --> 28:15.072
I'll grab a pack of cigarettes.

28:15.083 --> 28:15.868
Ok.

28:16.083 --> 28:17.994
Erdao hospital, 12 bottles.

28:18.667 --> 28:19.122
Thanks.

28:19.125 --> 28:20.125
Welcome.

28:43.500 --> 28:44.865
What are you doing?

28:51.125 --> 28:51.989
Stop!

28:52.000 --> 28:53.080
Be a man. Stop!

28:53.083 --> 28:54.414
How can you do this?

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
Who is he?

29:07.292 --> 29:08.292
Peng hao,

29:08.625 --> 29:09.740
a country boy.

29:10.125 --> 29:12.537
Lives a tough life.

29:12.542 --> 29:13.643
Left his family after he gets sick.

29:13.667 --> 29:15.623
But he shouldn't have robbed us.

29:16.250 --> 29:17.330
How can we find him?

29:18.708 --> 29:19.868
You fucking stop!

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
Still running?

29:40.417 --> 29:41.702
Get in the car!

29:53.250 --> 29:54.250
Move.

30:00.458 --> 30:01.458
Stop!

30:01.875 --> 30:02.875
Stop!

30:03.125 --> 30:04.365
Listen? Stop! Hear me?

30:05.042 --> 30:06.122
Stop! Listen?

30:06.125 --> 30:06.739
Stop!

30:06.875 --> 30:07.455
Did you hear me?

30:07.458 --> 30:08.573
Bro, bro.

30:14.750 --> 30:16.581
He fell over.

30:16.958 --> 30:17.958
Go get him.

30:22.500 --> 30:23.500
Run!

30:24.208 --> 30:25.243
Keep running!

30:36.208 --> 30:37.208
Where are my drugs?

30:37.708 --> 30:38.948
Where are they?

31:01.000 --> 31:02.331
You wanna be a hero?

31:05.292 --> 31:06.623
A gentleman thief?

31:07.208 --> 31:09.164
I worked so hard

31:09.500 --> 31:11.536
to bring you affordable drugs.

31:12.500 --> 31:13.820
How could you treat me like this?

31:14.958 --> 31:16.494
You work for money.

31:27.042 --> 31:28.407
How long haven't you been home?

31:38.625 --> 31:40.035
Look at you!

31:40.417 --> 31:42.078
How can you pay me back?

31:42.625 --> 31:43.831
What should I do?

31:59.708 --> 32:01.198
I understand.

32:02.458 --> 32:03.458
I know.

32:05.375 --> 32:07.036
You have my word.

32:08.292 --> 32:09.292
Ok.

32:11.333 --> 32:12.743
God bless you.

32:18.708 --> 32:20.414
You are the sales agent now.

33:43.667 --> 33:45.123
God bless you.

34:08.792 --> 34:10.592
"Great human qualities:
The complete edition"

34:46.000 --> 34:47.206
"Operating room."

35:00.750 --> 35:02.331
Step aside.

35:03.875 --> 35:04.705
Liu.

35:04.708 --> 35:05.868
Have you asked about it?

35:06.167 --> 35:07.282
It's the 4th. Next month.

35:07.625 --> 35:08.625
Watch closely.

35:08.833 --> 35:09.538
Sure.

35:09.542 --> 35:10.122
Bro.

35:10.125 --> 35:11.125
Yes?

35:11.417 --> 35:13.874
Zhao bin asked if we could
supply some to other provinces.

35:14.208 --> 35:14.788
No.

35:14.792 --> 35:15.792
Why?

35:16.083 --> 35:17.883
Can you have full control
in other provinces?

35:18.625 --> 35:20.365
Tell him to mind his words.

35:22.625 --> 35:25.037
I've told you all. No more pennants.

35:25.042 --> 35:26.122
No more room for them.

35:26.125 --> 35:27.410
Chong hospital group
says they need to send you one,

35:27.417 --> 35:28.497
since all the others did.

35:28.500 --> 35:29.500
What does it say?

35:31.583 --> 35:34.370
Kind heart and healing hands benefit
all living creatures.

35:34.375 --> 35:37.037
Your name shall be
engraved in the people's hearts forever.

35:37.875 --> 35:39.206
That's a good one.

35:46.125 --> 35:47.035
What happened?

35:47.042 --> 35:48.042
Captain huang.

35:48.875 --> 35:49.875
Got bitten.

35:51.292 --> 35:52.372
Seriously?

35:52.458 --> 35:53.458
What's up?

35:53.875 --> 35:55.160
Go upstairs when you are done.

35:55.167 --> 35:56.327
Chief hao is looking for you.

36:00.250 --> 36:01.250
Chief,

36:01.375 --> 36:01.909
you want me?

36:01.917 --> 36:02.917
Yes, come here.

36:03.208 --> 36:04.414
Let me make an introduction.

36:04.417 --> 36:05.953
This is cao bin,

36:05.958 --> 36:07.789
the most capable detective in my team.

36:07.792 --> 36:10.158
This is the pharmaceutical rep
of nuowa in Switzerland,

36:10.167 --> 36:11.373
Mr. zhao lizhong.

36:11.667 --> 36:12.247
How do you do?

36:12.250 --> 36:13.080
Nice meeting you.

36:13.083 --> 36:14.619
Take a look at this.

36:14.625 --> 36:15.705
What's the matter?

36:17.625 --> 36:18.660
Well.

36:21.417 --> 36:24.864
We have a cancer drug called glinic,

36:24.875 --> 36:28.447
which has long been pirated by
an Indian pharmaceutical factory.

36:28.458 --> 36:31.495
Recently, we have found such
counterfeit drugs in Shanghai,

36:31.500 --> 36:33.036
and have flooded the market.

36:33.458 --> 36:35.744
The head office is very concerned,

36:35.750 --> 36:38.492
so they send me over to ask for your help.

36:38.500 --> 36:39.239
What do you think?

36:39.250 --> 36:40.581
Can you handle it?

36:41.042 --> 36:42.042
No problem.

36:42.250 --> 36:44.226
Our superiors have attached
great importance to this case.

36:44.250 --> 36:45.535
You need to pay close attention.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.800
Then we will be counting
on you, officer cao.

36:48.208 --> 36:50.415
It's evil to sell counterfeit drugs.

36:51.125 --> 36:52.525
I feel duty bound to make it right.

36:55.167 --> 36:57.351
Your mom wants you to immigrate with her.
What do you say?

36:57.375 --> 36:58.375
I won't go.

37:00.417 --> 37:01.657
Where do I stay then?

37:02.125 --> 37:03.125
In your shop?

37:04.833 --> 37:06.289
You can stay with your grandpa.

37:07.583 --> 37:09.198
Let me think it over.

37:09.833 --> 37:11.789
Alright, alright.

37:11.792 --> 37:13.123
I'm starving!

37:14.375 --> 37:16.081
I'm starving!

37:17.250 --> 37:18.250
Iv.

37:21.917 --> 37:22.917
Sihui.

37:25.292 --> 37:26.202
Thanks, bro.

37:26.208 --> 37:27.323
Here are the drugs.

37:29.708 --> 37:30.708
Liu.

37:33.917 --> 37:35.077
God bless you.

37:35.083 --> 37:36.163
Amen. Amen.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
Yellow hair.

37:41.917 --> 37:43.908
You've finally paid up.

37:44.250 --> 37:45.365
We are even.

37:52.708 --> 37:53.868
Where are you going?

37:53.875 --> 37:54.875
Wanna quit?

37:57.292 --> 37:58.532
Here's what you have earned.

37:58.542 --> 38:00.828
Don't be so stupid and give
away your drugs again.

38:02.417 --> 38:03.623
Don't just stand there.

38:05.250 --> 38:06.285
Come over here.

38:09.750 --> 38:10.750
Come here.

38:13.458 --> 38:14.458
Take it.

38:16.167 --> 38:17.247
Say thanks to brother yong.

38:17.833 --> 38:18.833
Come on.

38:20.333 --> 38:21.197
Thanks.

38:21.208 --> 38:22.208
Who are you thanking?

38:24.708 --> 38:25.242
You, bro.

38:25.250 --> 38:26.250
You're welcome!

38:27.125 --> 38:28.956
Tonight, all drinks on me.

38:28.958 --> 38:30.494
Company retreat.

38:32.833 --> 38:34.243
Guys, a toast!

38:34.292 --> 38:35.623
To our brother yong!

38:35.625 --> 38:36.785
To brother yong! Thank you!

38:36.792 --> 38:38.453
Thanks, bro. Love you.

38:39.333 --> 38:40.118
Ready?

38:40.125 --> 38:40.659
One.

38:40.667 --> 38:41.247
Two.

38:41.292 --> 38:42.292
Three.

38:45.292 --> 38:48.329
Come on! Bottles up! Bottles up!

38:53.083 --> 38:54.243
A little less for you.

38:55.250 --> 38:56.114
Huihui.

38:56.125 --> 38:57.956
No more drinking. It's dance time.

39:02.583 --> 39:03.242
Bro.

39:03.250 --> 39:04.581
Enjoy yourselves. I'll be right back.

39:04.583 --> 39:05.663
Where are you going?

39:05.958 --> 39:07.073
He asked me to dance.

39:07.333 --> 39:08.413
Say no. Just stay.

39:08.417 --> 39:10.624
I'm telling you to dance. Hurry.

39:16.083 --> 39:17.289
Take your hands off her.

39:18.500 --> 39:19.956
Don't you know you are a customer today?

39:19.958 --> 39:21.073
Come back and sit down.

39:22.333 --> 39:24.244
I'm telling you to stay. Do you hear me?

39:33.333 --> 39:34.698
Sir, how about this?

39:34.833 --> 39:36.289
Let her dance first.

39:36.292 --> 39:38.749
And she'll join you afterwards.

39:38.958 --> 39:40.698
Didn't you hear me just now?

39:41.458 --> 39:42.868
She is a customer today.

39:42.875 --> 39:44.115
Not your dancer!

39:44.875 --> 39:46.740
Who else can dance if she is not going?

39:46.750 --> 39:47.785
You can.

39:51.333 --> 39:52.698
Are you kidding me?

39:52.708 --> 39:53.868
I'm not.

39:54.167 --> 39:55.657
Today I just want to see you dance.

39:55.667 --> 39:57.123
There's no point for me to dance.

39:57.125 --> 39:59.036
Customers pay to see her dance.

39:59.042 --> 40:00.373
Need more money, right?

40:04.500 --> 40:05.500
Can you dance now?

40:08.292 --> 40:09.532
Can you?

40:13.458 --> 40:14.573
I dare you.

40:19.417 --> 40:20.623
Just wait and see.

41:01.875 --> 41:02.614
Come over here.

41:02.625 --> 41:03.956
I'm good. No worries.

41:03.958 --> 41:04.958
Liu,

41:05.292 --> 41:06.156
are you ok?

41:06.167 --> 41:06.826
Fine, I'm fine.

41:06.833 --> 41:07.618
See you, bro.

41:07.625 --> 41:08.625
Ok

41:09.333 --> 41:10.413
Go. Go.

41:11.542 --> 41:12.542
Next one.

41:16.208 --> 41:17.208
Sihui,

41:17.625 --> 41:18.330
let me take you home.

41:18.333 --> 41:20.665
No thanks, bro. Just a few steps away.

41:20.667 --> 41:21.782
Hop in.

41:22.750 --> 41:24.035
I'll take you home.

41:24.792 --> 41:25.998
No, thank you.

41:26.458 --> 41:27.458
Come on.

41:29.750 --> 41:30.750
Come.

41:44.750 --> 41:45.910
Have a seat, brother yong.

41:47.667 --> 41:49.077
Take a break.

41:49.083 --> 41:50.448
I'll go take a shower.

42:46.750 --> 42:47.910
Is the kid asleep?

42:51.042 --> 42:52.202
How do you...

42:52.458 --> 42:53.573
Oh, my...

42:57.333 --> 42:58.413
Do you...

42:58.417 --> 42:59.657
Take care of her on your own?

43:00.875 --> 43:02.456
Sometimes my mom comes to help.

43:04.125 --> 43:05.125
How about her dad?

43:09.875 --> 43:10.875
Sihui.

43:12.292 --> 43:13.292
Bro,

43:13.542 --> 43:14.873
hurry up.

43:14.875 --> 43:16.706
Or she might wake up soon.

43:17.333 --> 43:18.333
I know.

43:25.583 --> 43:26.583
Sihui.

43:28.542 --> 43:29.952
Sihui.

43:39.500 --> 43:40.785
If you feel awkward here.

43:41.292 --> 43:42.577
There is a guesthouse downstairs.

43:42.583 --> 43:43.914
Let's get a room there.

43:44.167 --> 43:45.577
That's not what I meant.

43:45.583 --> 43:46.698
Sihui, listen to me,

43:47.042 --> 43:48.157
put your clothes back.

43:48.167 --> 43:49.167
Listen to me.

43:49.750 --> 43:50.535
You don't have to...

43:50.542 --> 43:51.542
Seriously.

43:51.583 --> 43:52.823
Listen to me,

43:55.917 --> 43:57.077
just forget it, please?

44:03.292 --> 44:04.122
Bro,

44:04.125 --> 44:06.411
shush! Keep your voice down.

44:06.750 --> 44:08.365
Get some rest. I gotta go.

44:17.792 --> 44:18.702
Chief,

44:18.708 --> 44:20.699
what the pharmaceutical rep said
seems not the case.

44:20.708 --> 44:22.369
Don't drop cigarette ash on the ground.

44:23.542 --> 44:24.822
These are not counterfeit drugs.

44:24.958 --> 44:26.664
They actually work.

44:27.250 --> 44:29.912
That drug costs almost 40,000 yuan,

44:30.375 --> 44:31.575
but this one just costs 5,000.

44:32.625 --> 44:33.910
Were they smuggled?

44:35.500 --> 44:36.500
Yes.

44:37.333 --> 44:38.994
Are they included in the medical manual?

44:39.917 --> 44:40.917
No.

44:41.375 --> 44:42.831
Then they are counterfeit drugs.

44:52.458 --> 44:53.458
How many left?

44:54.458 --> 44:55.458
More than three.

44:58.625 --> 44:59.625
A pair of queens.

45:01.667 --> 45:02.667
A pair of deuces!

45:03.125 --> 45:05.161
Play your hand!

45:05.750 --> 45:06.785
Come on!

45:06.792 --> 45:07.792
Bomb.

45:10.375 --> 45:11.375
I have one card left.

45:18.458 --> 45:19.664
Straight draw.

45:19.667 --> 45:20.873
All gone! I win!

45:21.208 --> 45:23.290
Bomb him! What are you bombing me for?

45:23.292 --> 45:24.684
If I hadn't done it, you would have won.

45:24.708 --> 45:26.198
Who the hell is the landlord?

45:26.208 --> 45:27.618
Are you a moron?

45:27.625 --> 45:29.161
Do you really know how to play it?
Did you bump your head?

45:29.167 --> 45:30.623
You picked the wrong landlord every time.

45:30.625 --> 45:31.455
I'm the landlord.

45:31.458 --> 45:32.868
Is something wrong with your head?

45:32.875 --> 45:34.866
Your brain is clogged by
that yellow hair, huh?

45:34.875 --> 45:35.955
Cut his hair! Cut his hair!

45:35.958 --> 45:37.414
Shave his head.

45:38.083 --> 45:39.323
Cut! Cut! Cut!

45:40.458 --> 45:41.243
Did you do it on purpose?

45:41.250 --> 45:41.784
Hello.

45:41.792 --> 45:42.952
You guys ganged up on me huh?

45:43.125 --> 45:44.114
Put your hands down.

45:44.125 --> 45:45.125
Hands down!

45:45.250 --> 45:46.250
Bro.

45:47.917 --> 45:49.703
My mom is now lying in hospital.

45:49.708 --> 45:51.494
If anything goes wrong,

45:51.500 --> 45:52.706
I will call the police.

45:52.875 --> 45:54.285
Are you threatening me?

45:54.292 --> 45:55.828
You should call them now!

45:56.292 --> 45:56.951
Watch your attitude!

45:56.958 --> 45:58.038
What attitude?

45:58.042 --> 46:00.784
The drugs I sell can save people.

46:00.792 --> 46:02.532
You may report me to the police
if you don't trust me.

46:02.542 --> 46:03.622
You will see what's what.

46:03.625 --> 46:05.411
But something went wrong
with my mom after she took your drugs.

46:05.417 --> 46:06.406
How could I possibly know if she took

46:06.417 --> 46:07.953
some other random drugs?

46:07.958 --> 46:09.038
How could you be so unreasonable?

46:09.042 --> 46:09.781
No, I am not!

46:09.792 --> 46:10.531
She is lying in the hospital.

46:10.542 --> 46:12.407
How can you prove my drugs are fake?

46:12.792 --> 46:13.827
Explain it.

46:15.333 --> 46:17.101
How come others are fine
after taking my drugs?

46:17.125 --> 46:18.035
Listen, mind your words!

46:18.042 --> 46:19.873
Hey, guys, stop!

46:21.292 --> 46:23.374
Calm down. Let's try to clear things up.

46:23.625 --> 46:25.225
We didn't mean you were blackmailing us.

46:25.417 --> 46:27.578
Our drugs have never caused any problems.

46:27.833 --> 46:29.243
Please think it over.

46:29.250 --> 46:30.831
In addition to our drugs,

46:31.208 --> 46:32.608
has she taken any other medication?

46:34.167 --> 46:35.782
Dear friends,

46:35.792 --> 46:39.614
those of you who have taken our German
glinic, please raise your hand.

46:41.708 --> 46:43.244
Wow, lots of you have.

46:51.125 --> 46:52.285
Madam,

46:52.292 --> 46:55.204
how do you feel about our drugs?

46:55.208 --> 46:56.664
Hello, professor zhang.

46:56.667 --> 46:59.409
As you can see, I'm feeling much better now

46:59.750 --> 47:01.240
and the melasma has disappeared.

47:01.583 --> 47:03.369
A lot better than before.

47:03.375 --> 47:04.740
Thank you professor zhang.

47:04.750 --> 47:06.536
Thanks to German glinic.

47:06.917 --> 47:07.906
Thank you ma'am.

47:07.917 --> 47:09.407
Sit down please.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.082
When I see patients show improved recovery,

47:19.208 --> 47:20.618
I feel gratified

47:21.750 --> 47:25.288
that our efforts have finally paid off.

47:26.250 --> 47:27.911
We have eradicated

47:27.917 --> 47:29.703
cml.

47:41.583 --> 47:42.583
Really?

47:44.542 --> 47:45.657
Dear friends,

47:46.042 --> 47:48.158
good news for you.

47:48.625 --> 47:51.697
We have just been informed
by our head office

47:51.708 --> 47:54.996
that all of you present
today can get our drugs

47:55.000 --> 47:58.993
at 2,000 yuan instead of 3,000 yuan.

48:01.333 --> 48:05.030
Let's give a big applause
to thank German glinic.

48:05.042 --> 48:06.873
And our gratitude to professor zhang.

48:08.333 --> 48:09.914
Now dear friends,

48:09.917 --> 48:12.875
please stand in line to
purchase the medication.

48:13.667 --> 48:16.329
Full of crap! Can't
believe they believe it.

48:16.333 --> 48:17.368
Sounds like a steal.

48:17.375 --> 48:18.809
A drowning man will clutch at a straw.

48:18.833 --> 48:20.698
He seems telling the truth.

48:20.708 --> 48:22.164
Don't be tricked. You fool!

48:22.542 --> 48:23.782
You trust too easily.

48:23.833 --> 48:24.572
What now?

48:24.583 --> 48:25.583
Call the cops.

48:25.708 --> 48:26.708
W ait.

48:27.708 --> 48:28.788
Where is liu?

48:30.750 --> 48:32.581
I hope you have a quick recovery.

48:33.083 --> 48:34.038
Don't push.

48:34.042 --> 48:35.042
We have more than enough.

48:35.333 --> 48:36.038
We've got plenty enough.

48:36.042 --> 48:37.998
Friends at the back. Don't push, please.

48:38.458 --> 48:40.824
Please be quiet.

48:42.708 --> 48:44.323
Dear friends.

48:44.333 --> 48:45.333
Who is this?

48:45.417 --> 48:47.578
Let me tell you something.

48:48.125 --> 48:50.537
This so-called professor zhang,

48:52.625 --> 48:55.492
is an imposter. A fraudster.

48:55.500 --> 48:57.582
That woman is his accomplice.

48:57.583 --> 49:00.325
And these are counterfeit drugs.

49:00.333 --> 49:02.324
Don't ever buy them!

49:02.333 --> 49:05.621
Patient in my church has
suffered from this drug,

49:05.625 --> 49:07.866
she is still lying in the hospital.

49:07.875 --> 49:11.117
Don't be fooled by this fake drug dealer.

49:11.125 --> 49:12.365
You cheat patients out of their money.

49:12.375 --> 49:14.491
You will go to hell.

49:14.958 --> 49:17.040
That's murder!

49:17.417 --> 49:18.782
Is that liu?

49:18.792 --> 49:19.792
Is that him?

49:19.875 --> 49:20.785
Yes.

49:20.792 --> 49:23.374
You will go to hell!

49:23.375 --> 49:24.615
Hell my ass!

49:24.625 --> 49:25.489
Get him out of here.

49:25.500 --> 49:28.207
God will definitely punish you.

49:28.208 --> 49:29.243
Dear friends.

49:40.208 --> 49:41.208
What do we do now?

49:41.417 --> 49:42.327
What else can we do?

49:42.333 --> 49:43.368
Get in there.

50:01.375 --> 50:02.375
Let's go.

50:09.917 --> 50:10.917
Come and grab the drugs!

50:21.958 --> 50:23.823
God is righteous.

50:23.833 --> 50:25.619
You do wicked things,

50:25.625 --> 50:27.786
god will punish you.

50:36.458 --> 50:37.618
Who the hell are you?

50:37.625 --> 50:38.740
Mind your own business!

50:38.750 --> 50:40.115
You are a quack!

50:40.125 --> 50:42.226
Aren't you afraid that you shall pay
for what you have done?

50:42.250 --> 50:43.831
You quack!

50:44.208 --> 50:45.163
Beat them!

50:45.167 --> 50:46.327
Beat them!

50:57.792 --> 51:00.283
Why you got into fighting
after you called the police?

51:00.875 --> 51:01.955
They fled.

51:02.250 --> 51:03.114
Sign your names here,

51:03.125 --> 51:04.125
press your fingerprints.

51:13.625 --> 51:15.411
What is the penalty if he got convicted?

51:15.417 --> 51:18.249
Selling fake drugs maybe penalized
with a prison sentence of 8 to 15 years.

51:18.250 --> 51:20.491
If it is a serious offense,
maybe life imprisonment.

51:21.250 --> 51:22.535
Why ask?

51:23.208 --> 51:24.323
Nothing.

51:24.333 --> 51:25.333
Next one.

51:26.083 --> 51:27.198
Here it is, my place.

51:27.208 --> 51:28.208
Thanks, bro.

51:31.333 --> 51:31.867
See you.

51:31.875 --> 51:32.875
Bye.

51:35.083 --> 51:36.083
Brother yong,

51:36.708 --> 51:38.164
are you free tonight?

51:47.083 --> 51:49.324
How is he? Cml isn't hereditary, is it?

51:49.583 --> 51:50.583
No, it isn't.

51:50.750 --> 51:52.286
It's not a genetic disorder.

51:52.583 --> 51:53.583
That's good to know.

51:54.458 --> 51:56.289
When I was diagnosed with cml,

51:56.292 --> 51:58.032
my wife was five months pregnant.

51:58.833 --> 52:01.370
I just wanted to die back then.

52:03.458 --> 52:05.619
When I first saw him after he was born,

52:05.625 --> 52:07.707
I don't wanna die anymore.

52:10.500 --> 52:12.340
All I wanted was to hear
him calling me daddy.

52:13.750 --> 52:15.035
Now everything is going better.

52:15.042 --> 52:17.124
We've got medicine and money.

52:17.250 --> 52:20.117
Should he marry early,
I might even be a grandfather.

52:20.208 --> 52:20.867
I'm sure you will.

52:20.875 --> 52:21.785
You think so?

52:21.792 --> 52:22.952
What a feast! Thank you.

52:22.958 --> 52:23.617
You are our special guest.

52:23.625 --> 52:24.831
Nothing special.

52:24.833 --> 52:25.743
Hope you'll like it.

52:25.750 --> 52:26.580
Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.

52:26.583 --> 52:27.368
My pleasure.

52:27.375 --> 52:28.660
Just family dishes.

52:28.667 --> 52:30.077
Bro, let's have a drink shall we?

52:30.083 --> 52:30.788
Ok, a little bit.

52:30.792 --> 52:32.282
Me too.

52:32.500 --> 52:33.500
Give it to me.

52:36.375 --> 52:38.286
That's enough. I can't drink that much.

52:42.917 --> 52:43.917
Brother yong,

52:44.500 --> 52:45.500
thank you.

52:47.792 --> 52:48.872
You are too polite.

52:55.250 --> 52:56.250
I'm flattered.

52:56.833 --> 52:57.833
You don't have to...

52:58.417 --> 52:59.202
A little bit.

52:59.417 --> 53:00.657
I will help myself.

53:00.875 --> 53:01.660
All right.

53:01.875 --> 53:02.455
Bro,

53:02.583 --> 53:03.903
I heard you have a child as well?

53:04.083 --> 53:04.697
How old?

53:04.708 --> 53:05.447
Yes, I have a son.

53:05.458 --> 53:06.197
Eight years old.

53:06.208 --> 53:07.789
Is he closer to you or to his mother?

53:07.792 --> 53:09.202
He is very close to me.

53:09.208 --> 53:11.164
He sticks to me like glue
since he was little.

53:11.167 --> 53:12.657
My son only wants his mother.

53:12.667 --> 53:13.952
He has taken his Sully mood out on me.

53:13.958 --> 53:15.494
It's hard to tell now.

53:15.500 --> 53:17.991
As they grow up
they'll go through rebellious phases.

53:27.000 --> 53:28.000
Who is it?

53:31.583 --> 53:32.583
Who is it?

53:41.000 --> 53:42.000
Who is it?

53:47.333 --> 53:48.368
Mr. Cheng,

53:49.708 --> 53:50.367
wait.

53:50.375 --> 53:51.375
W ait.

53:52.458 --> 53:54.198
I need to talk to you.

53:54.667 --> 53:55.702
Just me.

53:56.667 --> 53:57.998
You, get out.

53:58.417 --> 53:59.417
Mr. Cheng,

54:01.500 --> 54:02.785
this really work?

54:03.500 --> 54:04.500
What do you want?

54:06.333 --> 54:08.415
No wonder you made trouble with me,

54:08.958 --> 54:10.698
we are doing the same trade.

54:16.083 --> 54:17.198
We are not the same.

54:17.917 --> 54:19.407
Ok you keep pretending.

54:19.958 --> 54:20.743
Come on.

54:20.958 --> 54:22.289
Let's cut the crap.

54:23.000 --> 54:24.240
I've done calculations for you.

54:24.250 --> 54:25.581
Your current sales model

54:25.583 --> 54:27.143
may earn you around one million a year.

54:27.208 --> 54:29.244
If you let me access the supply channel,

54:29.250 --> 54:31.130
I can offer you two million.
What do you think?

54:32.083 --> 54:33.763
I have no idea what you are talking about.

54:35.500 --> 54:36.114
Go away

54:36.125 --> 54:37.240
or I'll call the police.

54:37.625 --> 54:39.411
Call the police?

54:39.875 --> 54:43.038
Just do it. Do it now.

54:43.583 --> 54:45.244
An investigation is
underway for these drugs.

54:45.250 --> 54:46.911
Call the police?

54:48.292 --> 54:49.577
You wanna bite the hook?

54:54.042 --> 54:55.077
Pal,

54:55.625 --> 54:58.241
this trade is not as easy as you think.

54:58.667 --> 55:00.032
If you keep selling like this,

55:00.042 --> 55:02.454
you will be caught in six months top.

55:02.458 --> 55:04.619
And you may get a 10 to 20 years sentence.

55:04.625 --> 55:06.425
So what's the point of
making all this money.

55:09.167 --> 55:10.167
Will you leave or not?

55:10.917 --> 55:12.123
That's it?

55:12.667 --> 55:13.827
Just go away.

55:20.083 --> 55:21.573
Such good drugs in your possession.

55:22.333 --> 55:24.449
What a waste!

55:28.125 --> 55:30.116
Come on, think about it.

55:37.542 --> 55:38.542
Take good care.

55:55.625 --> 55:56.284
Hello.

55:56.292 --> 55:57.247
Mr. Cheng.

55:57.250 --> 55:58.786
The cops will be arriving soon.

55:59.292 --> 56:00.407
Be prepared.

56:00.417 --> 56:01.532
What do you mean? Hello?

56:01.875 --> 56:02.875
Hello?

56:13.583 --> 56:14.538
You are the boss?

56:14.542 --> 56:16.123
Someone reported you for
selling fake drugs.

56:16.125 --> 56:17.125
Everyone, get down!

56:17.417 --> 56:18.417
Search here.

56:18.875 --> 56:19.875
Get down!

56:20.083 --> 56:21.448
We sell health care products.

56:21.833 --> 56:23.118
Get down! Hey, you!

56:35.542 --> 56:36.542
Captain.

56:44.125 --> 56:45.445
Why are there that many pennants?

56:47.500 --> 56:48.706
People gave it to me.

56:48.708 --> 56:49.948
You sell love drugs.

56:50.292 --> 56:51.828
Who'd give you so many pennants?

56:52.875 --> 56:53.875
The drug works.

56:54.958 --> 56:55.958
Is that illegal?

56:57.792 --> 56:58.792
Let's go.

56:59.542 --> 57:00.662
Thanks for your cooperation.

57:13.583 --> 57:14.583
Hello?

57:14.917 --> 57:16.157
The cops left?

57:16.167 --> 57:17.373
What do you want?

57:17.375 --> 57:18.375
Nothing.

57:19.042 --> 57:20.327
Just wanna ask,

57:20.708 --> 57:23.040
if you'll reconsider my proposal.

57:53.625 --> 57:55.616
I bet I can drink you under the table.

57:55.625 --> 57:56.990
You know I can really drink

57:57.000 --> 57:58.706
don't kid yourself.

57:59.000 --> 57:59.659
I'm not.

57:59.667 --> 58:00.667
Get a drink.

58:00.750 --> 58:02.706
Have a drink, it's okay.

58:02.708 --> 58:04.039
Priest liu, you are so happy today.

58:04.042 --> 58:04.906
Drink some more.

58:04.917 --> 58:07.078
Don't mess with me.

58:07.417 --> 58:08.907
To our business success!

58:09.583 --> 58:10.163
Keep it up!

58:10.167 --> 58:11.031
To our business success!

58:11.042 --> 58:12.282
To continued success!

58:15.583 --> 58:17.448
I need to tell you something.

58:18.292 --> 58:20.874
Destiny brought us together.

58:21.292 --> 58:22.828
You guys call me brother yong.

58:23.667 --> 58:24.747
And for that I'm very thankful.

58:24.750 --> 58:25.750
Brother yong.

58:26.000 --> 58:26.739
Brother yong.

58:26.750 --> 58:27.535
Brother yong.

58:27.542 --> 58:28.782
Say thank you for three times.

58:32.625 --> 58:34.957
But, all good things must come to an end.

58:36.458 --> 58:37.243
Starting from tomorrow,

58:37.250 --> 58:38.786
I'll stop selling the drugs.

58:45.333 --> 58:46.664
He is drunk.

58:47.042 --> 58:48.703
That's not funny at all.

58:48.708 --> 58:49.788
What are you talking about?

58:50.167 --> 58:51.498
You're kidding.

58:51.833 --> 58:54.119
I will stop selling drugs tomorrow.

58:55.375 --> 58:57.081
Someone else will take it over

58:57.958 --> 58:59.118
at a higher price, though.

58:59.750 --> 59:00.956
10,000 yuan a bottle.

59:02.042 --> 59:03.327
But we made a deal.

59:03.917 --> 59:05.623
You guys can still get it for 3,000.

59:06.250 --> 59:07.410
Who will be selling?

59:08.792 --> 59:09.792
Zhang changlin.

59:10.875 --> 59:12.115
That so called professor zhang.

59:13.083 --> 59:14.539
He is more experienced than us.

59:15.042 --> 59:16.722
He's been selling drugs for over a decade.

59:17.958 --> 59:19.823
Frankly speaking, nothing
has gone wrong so far

59:19.833 --> 59:20.913
just by pure luck.

59:23.250 --> 59:24.250
What the...

59:24.792 --> 59:27.472
Don't you know his fake drugs
have put many patients' lives at risk?

59:27.500 --> 59:29.616
His drugs are just a mix
of paracetamol and a little flour.

59:29.625 --> 59:30.705
It's not fatal.

59:31.500 --> 59:33.661
That old lady last time
must have taken something else.

59:33.667 --> 59:35.248
Some unknown stuff.

59:37.833 --> 59:39.323
How can you ever say that?

59:41.792 --> 59:43.123
Why can't 1?

59:43.583 --> 59:45.039
He preys on the patients for money.

59:45.042 --> 59:46.202
No mercy on victims.

59:46.875 --> 59:48.661
He will go to hell.

59:50.583 --> 59:51.789
How much did he pay you?

59:52.958 --> 59:54.118
It's not about money.

59:57.000 --> 59:59.160
Do you know the maximum penalty
for selling fake drugs?

59:59.875 --> 01:00:01.081
So you just push us...

01:00:06.292 --> 01:00:08.749
I mean, push your patients
away to that quack?

01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:09.910
So?

01:00:11.542 --> 01:00:12.742
The drugs are still available,

01:00:15.042 --> 01:00:16.532
just a little bit more expensive.

01:00:19.292 --> 01:00:21.328
Don't you know many patients
can't even afford 5,000 yuan?

01:00:21.333 --> 01:00:23.119
That's none of my business!

01:00:24.417 --> 01:00:26.157
I'm an Indian god qil seller.

01:00:26.833 --> 01:00:28.414
How can I take care of them all?

01:00:30.375 --> 01:00:32.161
I need to take care of
my father and my son.

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:34.331
What happens to them if I'm arrested?

01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:40.912
Not to mention,
I risked my life bringing these drugs back.

01:00:43.458 --> 01:00:45.915
You are alive today because of me!
You all owe me!

01:00:48.667 --> 01:00:50.532
I don't have leukemia!

01:01:13.125 --> 01:01:14.125
I thank you!

01:01:15.125 --> 01:01:17.036
May your Indian oil shop expand.

01:01:34.125 --> 01:01:35.331
What are you doing?

01:01:35.333 --> 01:01:35.992
Come back here.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.331
Yellow hair, yellow hair!

01:01:37.625 --> 01:01:38.625
Hey!

01:01:46.750 --> 01:01:47.785
Thanks, brother yong.

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:18.161
May god bless you.

01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:50.081
Maybe we have drunk too much.

01:02:53.833 --> 01:02:54.833
Get out!

01:04:19.333 --> 01:04:23.155
"One year later"

01:04:25.958 --> 01:04:26.617
Mr. li.

01:04:26.625 --> 01:04:27.625
This way, please.

01:04:27.833 --> 01:04:30.040
Here is our sewing workshop.

01:04:30.292 --> 01:04:30.872
You can rest assured.

01:04:30.875 --> 01:04:33.833
Our assembly line is fully developed.

01:04:34.042 --> 01:04:36.749
All the equiments are imported.

01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:39.492
I've already planned to
import some more new equipment.

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:41.115
Over there is our cutting workshop.

01:04:41.375 --> 01:04:42.660
Come. This way, please.

01:04:44.125 --> 01:04:45.080
Please take a look.

01:04:45.083 --> 01:04:46.083
All right.

01:04:48.125 --> 01:04:50.116
Just follow me.

01:04:51.708 --> 01:04:53.039
Mr. li, I'll lead the way.

01:05:02.542 --> 01:05:04.749
Sister, what brought you here?

01:05:05.125 --> 01:05:08.162
Brother yong, I've finally found you.

01:05:08.625 --> 01:05:09.910
Everything ok?

01:05:10.708 --> 01:05:11.823
How is iv doing?

01:05:13.417 --> 01:05:14.532
He is not doing well.

01:05:15.458 --> 01:05:17.244
Do you still have access to Indian glinic?

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:19.380
Zhang changlin is doing
the business, isn't he?

01:05:19.458 --> 01:05:20.458
He disappeared.

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:22.240
The police confiscated all the drugs.

01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:23.726
We are out of drugs for a long time now.

01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:24.489
The police?

01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:25.831
How come?

01:05:26.083 --> 01:05:27.539
Someone reported him to the police.

01:05:27.792 --> 01:05:29.453
He raised the price to 20,000 yuan.

01:05:29.708 --> 01:05:31.949
Many can't afford it
so they won't cover for him anymore.

01:05:32.833 --> 01:05:33.833
Right away.

01:05:35.583 --> 01:05:36.322
Listen,

01:05:36.333 --> 01:05:37.698
leave your phone number
to the security guard.

01:05:37.708 --> 01:05:38.868
I'll come over to see him soon after.

01:05:38.875 --> 01:05:39.864
Brother yong.

01:05:39.875 --> 01:05:41.911
Iv has already had several operations.
We're broke.

01:05:41.917 --> 01:05:43.407
He is breaking down and
thinking of giving up.

01:05:43.417 --> 01:05:44.577
I understand. But today,

01:05:44.583 --> 01:05:45.413
I've already got plans.

01:05:45.417 --> 01:05:46.657
He slashed his wrist.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.207
We found him in time.

01:05:50.208 --> 01:05:51.994
He would be dead without the drugs.

01:05:52.542 --> 01:05:53.372
Brother please, please!

01:05:53.375 --> 01:05:54.375
Don't do that.

01:05:54.708 --> 01:05:55.242
I'm coming.

01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:56.205
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. li.

01:05:56.208 --> 01:05:57.573
Wang, come here.

01:05:57.583 --> 01:05:58.948
Leave your phone number to him, all right?

01:05:58.958 --> 01:06:00.573
I'll come over to visit him in two days.

01:06:00.625 --> 01:06:02.536
I beg you. Please save him, please!

01:06:04.292 --> 01:06:08.410
Our kid is too little to lose his father.

01:06:08.417 --> 01:06:10.157
Let go of me!

01:06:52.625 --> 01:06:54.957
"Indian glinic"

01:07:03.958 --> 01:07:07.246
"Zhang changlin is wanted."

01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:26.875
Iv.

01:07:28.333 --> 01:07:28.992
Iv.

01:07:29.333 --> 01:07:30.333
Yes?

01:07:50.417 --> 01:07:51.998
You look dashing in your haircut.

01:07:54.375 --> 01:07:56.616
You are pretty brave huh?
Wanna kill yourself?

01:08:01.083 --> 01:08:02.323
Have an orange.

01:08:06.583 --> 01:08:08.164
How did it come to this?

01:08:11.292 --> 01:08:12.532
No more drugs.

01:08:14.083 --> 01:08:15.083
And that's that.

01:08:22.292 --> 01:08:22.906
Hey.

01:08:23.207 --> 01:08:24.823
The patient needs debriding now.

01:08:24.832 --> 01:08:26.118
Please go outside.

01:09:33.542 --> 01:09:34.542
Liu.

01:09:41.375 --> 01:09:43.491
He said that you were not his rep any more.

01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:44.831
He won't sell you drugs.

01:09:46.832 --> 01:09:48.198
I'll go to India again

01:09:48.207 --> 01:09:49.493
and get him some drugs from the pharmacy.

01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:50.330
No way.

01:09:50.332 --> 01:09:53.621
The inspection is very strict you
can't even bring in one bottle.

01:09:54.125 --> 01:09:55.706
Then we'll have go by boat.

01:09:55.708 --> 01:09:57.588
The one we used once might
still be accessible.

01:10:01.833 --> 01:10:03.198
He has advanced to blast phase.

01:10:03.833 --> 01:10:05.619
Medicine can't help him anymore.

01:10:06.417 --> 01:10:08.157
Isn't there anything else we can do?

01:10:10.833 --> 01:10:11.833
There's one.

01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:13.869
Try bone marrow transplant.

01:10:15.167 --> 01:10:16.623
Very slim chance of success, though.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.440
We don't even know
whether he could come through chemotherapy.

01:10:19.542 --> 01:10:20.076
I personally do not recommend.

01:10:20.083 --> 01:10:21.083
Doctor.

01:10:22.167 --> 01:10:23.167
We'll do it.

01:13:13.667 --> 01:13:14.827
Just leave.

01:14:45.625 --> 01:14:48.992
Some said India is a pharmacy for the poor.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.116
Because we have a merciful government.

01:14:51.625 --> 01:14:55.413
But right now the Swiss nuowa company
is suing the Indian government,

01:14:55.417 --> 01:14:58.329
trying to stop us from
producing cheap medicines.

01:14:58.875 --> 01:15:00.911
They have some background strong.

01:15:01.708 --> 01:15:05.075
No country would dare to buy
medicines from us. No country.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:07.865
What if your government loses the suit?

01:15:08.333 --> 01:15:10.540
The pharmaceutical company shuts down.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.286
Indian glinic disappears.

01:15:18.708 --> 01:15:20.244
But, don't worry, Cheng.

01:15:20.875 --> 01:15:23.332
I will provide you with
whatever you need right now.

01:15:27.083 --> 01:15:28.198
Thank you very much.

01:16:14.250 --> 01:16:15.850
I'm going to do the drug business again.

01:16:16.292 --> 01:16:17.292
Come back to help me.

01:16:30.958 --> 01:16:31.958
Step aside.

01:16:45.125 --> 01:16:46.240
Everyone is here.

01:16:47.708 --> 01:16:49.244
I've got the old list here.

01:16:50.833 --> 01:16:53.119
I know some of them are gone.

01:16:54.458 --> 01:16:56.164
So please go and check

01:16:56.167 --> 01:16:57.623
who are still alive.

01:16:57.625 --> 01:16:59.286
Then give the names to sihui.

01:17:00.042 --> 01:17:02.533
We'll start selling drugs again next week.

01:17:03.292 --> 01:17:04.498
However, I can only ensure the supply

01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:06.081
to the patients we knew before.

01:17:06.958 --> 01:17:08.494
Keep a low profile.

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:09.535
Hope you can understand.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.285
I don't wanna go to jail.

01:17:11.292 --> 01:17:12.577
How much?

01:17:15.375 --> 01:17:16.375
500.

01:17:56.583 --> 01:17:57.743
Have you been back home yet?

01:17:58.750 --> 01:17:59.750
No, I won't go.

01:18:02.708 --> 01:18:04.308
They thought I was dead a long time ago.

01:18:05.292 --> 01:18:06.327
I don't wanna scare them.

01:18:06.792 --> 01:18:07.827
But you are not dead yet.

01:18:09.042 --> 01:18:10.042
Sooner or later.

01:18:12.208 --> 01:18:13.573
You better go visit.

01:18:16.250 --> 01:18:17.740
Get a haircut first.

01:18:19.042 --> 01:18:20.202
It's scary enough.

01:18:29.042 --> 01:18:31.454
You despise me a lot, don't you?

01:18:34.125 --> 01:18:35.125
Yeah.

01:18:39.875 --> 01:18:40.875
I used to.

01:19:00.417 --> 01:19:01.417
Nuts.

01:19:02.333 --> 01:19:03.333
Go walk ahead!

01:19:04.083 --> 01:19:05.163
Yellow dog.

01:19:18.333 --> 01:19:19.243
Is this your car?

01:19:19.250 --> 01:19:20.205
Don't you know it's in the way?

01:19:20.208 --> 01:19:21.243
Drive off, quick.

01:19:23.458 --> 01:19:24.823
Do you hear me?

01:19:24.833 --> 01:19:25.948
Get into the car.

01:19:26.458 --> 01:19:27.914
We'll go. Right away.

01:19:39.042 --> 01:19:41.704
This photo was taken on
march 20th, in jing'an.

01:19:43.250 --> 01:19:44.250
April 8th.

01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:46.750
September 5th.

01:19:47.667 --> 01:19:49.532
This guy might still be in Shanghai now.

01:19:49.542 --> 01:19:51.658
I'm planning for an inch-by-inch search.

01:19:51.667 --> 01:19:52.998
Give me a month, I'll try.

01:19:53.833 --> 01:19:55.118
To catch zhang changlin.

01:19:55.125 --> 01:19:56.125
One month.

01:19:56.292 --> 01:19:57.702
How long does this case stay open?

01:19:57.708 --> 01:19:58.572
Half a year.

01:19:58.583 --> 01:19:59.914
You still haven't got him!

01:20:00.875 --> 01:20:02.831
Fake drugs are in the market again.

01:20:02.833 --> 01:20:04.118
That's how you've done your job?

01:20:04.333 --> 01:20:06.915
Chief, may I say something?

01:20:08.667 --> 01:20:10.157
Zhang changlin is still at large.

01:20:10.167 --> 01:20:13.239
So someone else must have taken it over.

01:20:14.542 --> 01:20:17.454
Can't we just go directly
to the source of the supply?

01:20:17.458 --> 01:20:20.245
Then the dealer will be identified.

01:20:20.250 --> 01:20:21.205
Mr. zhao,

01:20:21.208 --> 01:20:24.075
you must know the Indian government's
position when it comes to fake drugs.

01:20:24.083 --> 01:20:26.018
[T's unrealistic to handle the case
across the border.

01:20:26.042 --> 01:20:27.498
We know what to do.

01:20:29.583 --> 01:20:30.583
All right.

01:20:31.333 --> 01:20:32.333
Besides,

01:20:32.917 --> 01:20:35.579
it's already an exception
for you to sit in here.

01:20:36.667 --> 01:20:38.953
I hope you won't interrupt
our meeting again.

01:20:40.125 --> 01:20:41.080
I'm sorry.

01:20:41.083 --> 01:20:42.083
Cao bin.

01:20:42.583 --> 01:20:43.743
Fifteen days.

01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:46.116
I must see this man within fifteen days.

01:20:50.583 --> 01:20:51.583
Police inspection.

01:20:52.708 --> 01:20:53.663
Open the door.

01:20:53.667 --> 01:20:54.952
Police!

01:20:55.208 --> 01:20:56.368
Come out.

01:20:56.375 --> 01:20:57.865
Police inspection. Come out now.

01:20:57.875 --> 01:21:00.036
I hope we all have faith.

01:21:00.250 --> 01:21:02.582
Don't lose hope in life.

01:21:02.583 --> 01:21:03.572
Not to mention,

01:21:03.583 --> 01:21:05.699
we can have access to affordable drugs now.

01:21:05.708 --> 01:21:06.823
Thank you.

01:21:09.708 --> 01:21:10.708
Be quiet.

01:21:20.792 --> 01:21:21.792
Get up.

01:21:23.667 --> 01:21:24.667
Get up.

01:21:27.875 --> 01:21:28.580
Hey you,

01:21:28.708 --> 01:21:29.823
get dressed.

01:21:29.833 --> 01:21:30.833
Get up.

01:21:35.458 --> 01:21:36.573
Hey you.

01:21:36.583 --> 01:21:38.119
Stay in line. Come with us.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.412
All those with drugs, follow us.

01:21:42.625 --> 01:21:43.990
Chop chop, move.

01:21:44.583 --> 01:21:45.583
Get a move on.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.865
I heard you were reluctant to cooperate.

01:22:11.333 --> 01:22:13.073
We investigators count on strong evidence.

01:22:13.917 --> 01:22:15.498
From every each of you,

01:22:16.167 --> 01:22:17.577
we've found fake drugs.

01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:21.365
Whether you cooperate or not,

01:22:21.917 --> 01:22:23.248
it makes no difference.

01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:29.380
Harboring criminals is
an accessory to a crime.

01:22:29.583 --> 01:22:31.244
I just want to remind you.

01:22:34.667 --> 01:22:35.952
What you're doing now

01:22:37.458 --> 01:22:38.664
is not doing him good.

01:22:39.792 --> 01:22:41.112
You are causing him more trouble.

01:22:50.333 --> 01:22:51.333
Officer,

01:22:52.125 --> 01:22:53.661
may I ask you a favour?

01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:03.332
I just wanted to beg you

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.833
to stop investigating Indian drugs, please?

01:23:08.833 --> 01:23:10.619
I've been sick for three years.

01:23:11.917 --> 01:23:14.329
The genuine medicine costs 40,000 a bottle.

01:23:14.333 --> 01:23:15.973
And I've been using them for three years.

01:23:17.875 --> 01:23:19.456
My house is gone,

01:23:21.125 --> 01:23:23.286
and my family is collapsing.

01:23:25.417 --> 01:23:28.329
Now we finally have cheap drugs.

01:23:29.125 --> 01:23:31.366
You insist they are fake.

01:23:32.833 --> 01:23:34.369
Fake or not,

01:23:35.375 --> 01:23:37.411
we know it better.

01:23:38.958 --> 01:23:41.620
It only costs 500 a bottle.

01:23:42.458 --> 01:23:44.949
The dealer has no margin.

01:23:46.167 --> 01:23:48.954
There are patients in every family.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.868
Who would know you can
stay healthy forever?

01:23:58.875 --> 01:24:01.241
Once you catch him,

01:24:03.708 --> 01:24:05.824
all of us have to die.

01:24:09.167 --> 01:24:11.158
I don't want to die.

01:24:13.083 --> 01:24:14.994
I want to live.

01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:17.660
Please.

01:24:31.708 --> 01:24:32.708
What do we do now?

01:24:37.750 --> 01:24:38.750
Release them.

01:24:39.250 --> 01:24:40.250
Seriously?

01:24:41.667 --> 01:24:42.782
Yes, let them go.

01:24:51.542 --> 01:24:53.248
No more excuses.

01:24:53.708 --> 01:24:55.073
The 15-day deadline is approaching.

01:24:55.083 --> 01:24:56.163
You must catch him.

01:24:56.167 --> 01:24:57.167
Chief.

01:24:57.333 --> 01:24:58.333
Chief!

01:24:58.958 --> 01:25:00.869
There'll be big trouble if we don't stop.

01:25:01.333 --> 01:25:03.619
We're cutting the patients' lifeline.

01:25:04.667 --> 01:25:05.998
It's really difficult for me.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.206
Difficult for you?

01:25:07.792 --> 01:25:09.123
So you think it's easy for me?

01:25:12.875 --> 01:25:13.875
Cao bin,

01:25:14.417 --> 01:25:17.659
the law outweighs sympathy,
don't you know that?

01:25:18.375 --> 01:25:19.865
We are law-enforcers.

01:25:20.292 --> 01:25:22.248
We should strictly adhere to the law.

01:25:23.125 --> 01:25:24.125
Excuse me.

01:25:35.208 --> 01:25:36.072
Frankly speaking,

01:25:36.083 --> 01:25:36.947
copycat drugs

01:25:36.958 --> 01:25:38.164
are fake drugs.

01:25:38.167 --> 01:25:41.534
Just like fake cigarettes,
fake alcohol and fake milk powder.

01:25:41.542 --> 01:25:42.542
No difference.

01:25:42.667 --> 01:25:44.578
Is it dangerous to take such drugs?

01:25:44.583 --> 01:25:45.868
Of course.

01:25:45.875 --> 01:25:47.706
And if something goes wrong,

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.809
small factories are unable
to take responsibilities.

01:25:49.833 --> 01:25:50.822
So, I want to

01:25:50.833 --> 01:25:53.324
advise all consumers that

01:25:53.333 --> 01:25:54.823
for the sake of your own health

01:25:54.833 --> 01:25:57.324
not to purchase and take such

01:25:57.333 --> 01:25:58.448
adulterated drugs.

01:26:26.958 --> 01:26:27.993
Mr. Cheng,

01:26:28.958 --> 01:26:30.994
we are in the same boat.

01:26:32.167 --> 01:26:33.373
If 1 got caught,

01:26:33.375 --> 01:26:34.205
you wouldn't get away either.

01:26:34.208 --> 01:26:35.208
Right?

01:26:38.792 --> 01:26:40.032
You asked for 200,000 yuan.

01:26:40.042 --> 01:26:41.373
Here is 300,000.

01:26:41.958 --> 01:26:43.038
Take the money and run.

01:26:43.583 --> 01:26:45.198
Never let the cat out of the bag.

01:26:51.083 --> 01:26:53.323
I've heard that you aren't doing this
for money this time

01:26:54.625 --> 01:26:55.910
wanna be a hero.

01:26:57.792 --> 01:26:59.623
But I have some advice for you.

01:27:00.667 --> 01:27:02.267
I've been doing this business for years,

01:27:02.792 --> 01:27:04.512
and I've realized there is a disease called

01:27:06.292 --> 01:27:07.452
poverty.

01:27:08.083 --> 01:27:09.789
There is no cure for poverty.

01:27:09.792 --> 01:27:11.282
There is nothing you can do.

01:27:11.958 --> 01:27:12.958
Forget it.

01:27:15.708 --> 01:27:16.708
Did you finish?

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Take care.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Who's that?

01:27:39.458 --> 01:27:41.494
Sir, new toiletries for you.

01:27:41.958 --> 01:27:42.958
One second.

01:27:53.042 --> 01:27:54.042
Sir.

01:27:55.417 --> 01:27:56.417
Sir!

01:28:05.083 --> 01:28:06.083
Go get him.

01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:08.500
Here.

01:28:13.833 --> 01:28:14.663
Stop!

01:28:14.667 --> 01:28:15.667
Don't move!

01:28:17.542 --> 01:28:18.873
Stay there. Don't move.

01:28:19.875 --> 01:28:21.866
Freeze!

01:28:22.625 --> 01:28:23.625
Freeze!

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.080
Keep running?

01:28:42.042 --> 01:28:43.282
Who has been selling the drugs?

01:28:45.083 --> 01:28:46.083
No clue.

01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:49.660
The earlier you confess, the better chance
you receive a less severe punishment.

01:28:51.417 --> 01:28:52.537
Give me a cigarette, please.

01:29:12.042 --> 01:29:13.202
You have the answer now?

01:29:15.167 --> 01:29:16.122
Yes.

01:29:16.125 --> 01:29:17.125
Who is that?

01:29:17.667 --> 01:29:18.667
Me.

01:29:19.125 --> 01:29:20.160
You think I'm stupid?

01:29:21.292 --> 01:29:24.132
How did you sell drugs while you were
on the run for the last half year?

01:29:24.708 --> 01:29:26.323
Honestly, it's not me.

01:29:32.125 --> 01:29:33.456
I am asking you once again.

01:29:33.458 --> 01:29:34.458
Who is it?

01:29:35.208 --> 01:29:36.163
No idea.

01:29:36.167 --> 01:29:37.782
You've got no shame, have you?

01:29:38.708 --> 01:29:40.494
Stop bragging you quack.

01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:41.910
I harm no one.

01:29:44.417 --> 01:29:47.249
I've saved many cml patients
over the last two years.

01:29:47.250 --> 01:29:48.956
At least 500 patients, if not 1,000.

01:29:49.708 --> 01:29:51.744
That counts as a good deed right?

01:29:54.333 --> 01:29:55.573
Don't you agree?

01:30:10.750 --> 01:30:12.081
That's savage.

01:30:12.083 --> 01:30:13.619
Dig out all his records.

01:30:13.625 --> 01:30:15.081
Deep!

01:30:16.333 --> 01:30:17.333
And,

01:30:17.542 --> 01:30:18.873
issue a wanted notice.

01:30:19.333 --> 01:30:21.809
Collect any intelligence of the fake drugs
from the whole city.

01:30:21.833 --> 01:30:22.788
I don't believe,

01:30:22.792 --> 01:30:24.632
we can't even find a
counterfeit drugs dealer.

01:30:32.125 --> 01:30:33.125
Captain.

01:30:33.375 --> 01:30:34.375
Go get some sleep.

01:30:35.083 --> 01:30:36.083
You should go.

01:31:10.292 --> 01:31:12.453
"Yong Cheng"

01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:14.115
I don't care about the
declining production.

01:31:14.125 --> 01:31:15.285
The quantity of drugs must be guaranteed.

01:31:15.292 --> 01:31:16.532
Not one bottle less.

01:31:16.875 --> 01:31:17.875
All right.

01:31:20.458 --> 01:31:21.458
Come in.

01:31:22.333 --> 01:31:23.664
Sir, someone wants to see you.

01:31:23.667 --> 01:31:24.372
Who's that?

01:31:24.375 --> 01:31:25.831
Officer cao.

01:31:28.458 --> 01:31:30.198
How do you get to know them?

01:31:30.458 --> 01:31:31.658
We once played cards together.

01:31:31.833 --> 01:31:33.198
They are indebted to me.

01:31:33.792 --> 01:31:35.623
Then they got screwed
by a fake drug dealer.

01:31:36.542 --> 01:31:37.782
So I helped them to collect their debts,

01:31:37.792 --> 01:31:39.373
but we got into a fight.

01:31:39.375 --> 01:31:40.956
Is that yellow hair a patient?

01:31:41.833 --> 01:31:43.039
You know him?

01:31:43.042 --> 01:31:44.042
Met him before.

01:31:45.333 --> 01:31:46.493
Why is he here with you?

01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:47.910
Someone introduced him to me.

01:31:48.625 --> 01:31:50.365
He is a patient,

01:31:50.375 --> 01:31:51.615
but he can do the works of two,

01:31:51.625 --> 01:31:53.081
and I only pay him half.

01:31:54.500 --> 01:31:55.865
Why ask?

01:31:56.667 --> 01:31:58.828
We are investigating an
Indian fake drug case.

01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:01.240
You've sold Indian god oil before,

01:32:02.208 --> 01:32:04.244
and you know some cml patients.

01:32:06.542 --> 01:32:08.142
So have you got something to do with it?

01:32:09.958 --> 01:32:11.664
You suspect me of selling fake drugs?

01:32:12.917 --> 01:32:14.032
Are you kidding me, sir?

01:32:14.292 --> 01:32:15.873
I know you despise me,

01:32:15.875 --> 01:32:17.285
but you can't slander me.

01:32:17.625 --> 01:32:19.456
You see, my factory is running smoothly,

01:32:19.917 --> 01:32:22.033
with hundreds of thousands
of net profit per month.

01:32:22.042 --> 01:32:23.248
Why would I touch fake drugs?

01:32:25.375 --> 01:32:26.535
Lucrative?

01:32:36.250 --> 01:32:37.365
Right, make sense.

01:32:38.958 --> 01:32:39.913
I'm off.

01:32:39.917 --> 01:32:40.656
I'll walk you out.

01:32:40.667 --> 01:32:41.667
No, thanks.

01:32:43.375 --> 01:32:45.161
The drugs dealer you had a fight with

01:32:45.167 --> 01:32:46.327
is arrested.

01:32:47.333 --> 01:32:48.333
Oh, really?

01:32:49.875 --> 01:32:51.866
Sounds good. Protecting the people.

01:33:04.125 --> 01:33:04.910
What?

01:33:04.917 --> 01:33:06.077
Where's your hair?

01:33:06.083 --> 01:33:07.083
Got a haircut.

01:33:08.292 --> 01:33:09.452
I'm going home in a few days.

01:33:10.958 --> 01:33:12.994
Your head looks so weird.

01:33:13.333 --> 01:33:14.413
You asked me to do it.

01:33:18.542 --> 01:33:20.422
Well, you do look better
with your yellow hair.

01:33:23.125 --> 01:33:24.365
Let me drive for a while.

01:33:24.375 --> 01:33:25.239
No way.

01:33:25.250 --> 01:33:26.285
Come on. No harm.

01:33:26.292 --> 01:33:27.452
Don't even think about it.

01:33:30.167 --> 01:33:31.156
Where are you going?

01:33:31.167 --> 01:33:31.997
Toilet.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:32.910
Just pee here.

01:33:32.917 --> 01:33:33.917
Need to poop.

01:33:40.542 --> 01:33:41.452
The same guys every time.

01:33:41.458 --> 01:33:43.039
I read from newspaper
and learn that those are fake drugs.

01:33:43.042 --> 01:33:44.327
The drugs are fatal.

01:33:44.333 --> 01:33:45.914
Then I promptly called and reported,

01:33:45.917 --> 01:33:47.077
so you can catch them red-handed.

01:33:47.083 --> 01:33:48.243
But these guys are really smart.

01:33:48.250 --> 01:33:49.850
They'll pick a different spot each time.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:50.705
Today.

01:33:50.708 --> 01:33:51.993
No, two days ago.

01:34:07.542 --> 01:34:08.622
What took you so long?

01:34:11.833 --> 01:34:12.833
What's up?

01:34:16.208 --> 01:34:17.208
I feel good.

01:34:18.250 --> 01:34:19.535
Hop in then.

01:34:29.042 --> 01:34:30.042
Hao.

01:34:30.750 --> 01:34:31.750
Hao!

01:34:32.458 --> 01:34:33.458
Hao!

01:35:25.042 --> 01:35:25.747
Pull over!

01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:26.956
Pull over!

01:35:26.958 --> 01:35:28.414
Stop there now!

01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:31.081
Pull over!

01:35:31.083 --> 01:35:32.289
Stop!

01:35:32.292 --> 01:35:33.372
Stop!

01:35:47.458 --> 01:35:48.458
Stop now!

01:37:15.167 --> 01:37:16.167
Where is he?

01:37:22.292 --> 01:37:23.292
He is gone.

01:37:29.583 --> 01:37:30.322
Take your hands off!

01:37:30.333 --> 01:37:31.948
He was only twenty years old.

01:37:31.958 --> 01:37:33.744
He just wanted to live! Is it a crime?

01:37:33.750 --> 01:37:34.750
Hands off!

01:37:35.667 --> 01:37:36.577
Answer me!

01:37:36.583 --> 01:37:37.583
Hands off!

01:37:38.208 --> 01:37:39.744
Answer my question!

01:37:40.875 --> 01:37:42.365
What is his crime?

01:37:43.792 --> 01:37:45.623
What is his crime?

01:37:47.375 --> 01:37:48.375
Let him go.

01:39:47.542 --> 01:39:48.748
What do you mean?

01:39:49.917 --> 01:39:51.157
I'm not capable enough.

01:39:51.833 --> 01:39:52.833
Cao bin,

01:39:53.417 --> 01:39:54.998
have you considered the consequences?

01:39:56.875 --> 01:39:58.581
I can accept any disciplinary act.

01:40:01.750 --> 01:40:03.030
I really can't handle this case.

01:40:07.208 --> 01:40:08.208
Get out.

01:40:18.542 --> 01:40:20.078
Are you the owner?

01:40:20.583 --> 01:40:21.583
Yes.

01:40:25.417 --> 01:40:27.954
We have filed a pre-action injunction

01:40:27.958 --> 01:40:29.914
to the supreme court in India.

01:40:30.333 --> 01:40:33.325
We should shut down the
fake pharmaceutical factories for now.

01:40:33.333 --> 01:40:36.245
It's all done. How else
can I help you today?

01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:40.038
I wish you could negotiate
with the Chinese government

01:40:40.042 --> 01:40:43.830
and clear out the dealers
as soons as possible.

01:40:43.833 --> 01:40:45.198
The drugs are no longer available?

01:40:45.542 --> 01:40:47.078
He said the factory was shut down,

01:40:47.333 --> 01:40:49.244
but they are still
available in the pharmacy.

01:40:49.250 --> 01:40:51.115
If we insist,

01:40:51.333 --> 01:40:53.915
he could repurchase the drugs
from the pharmacy at retail price.

01:40:54.125 --> 01:40:55.285
How much is that?

01:40:55.875 --> 01:40:57.490
2,000 per bottle.

01:41:05.042 --> 01:41:06.623
Okay. Do it.

01:41:06.625 --> 01:41:07.990
How much do we sell?

01:41:08.333 --> 01:41:09.333
500.

01:41:09.833 --> 01:41:10.948
I will cover the rest.

01:41:15.625 --> 01:41:16.684
Sihui, - thanks for waiting.

01:41:16.708 --> 01:41:17.493
Are you still in contact with

01:41:17.500 --> 01:41:19.860
- the patient groups of other provinces?
- He says he agree.

01:41:26.167 --> 01:41:28.249
"Dear friends, now large amounts of
Indian glinic are offered at cost,"

01:41:28.250 --> 01:41:30.332
"with the same efficacy
as the genuine Swiss glinic."

01:41:38.375 --> 01:41:39.990
"Please spread this to every
cml patients' chat group.”

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.760
"Should you be interested,
contact me asap."

01:41:53.625 --> 01:41:54.455
"Really?"

01:41:54.458 --> 01:41:55.898
"The same efficacy as Swiss glinic?"

01:42:00.292 --> 01:42:02.954
"My mum finally gets medication."

01:42:15.875 --> 01:42:18.537
"I want 15 bottles."

01:42:18.708 --> 01:42:20.869
"I want 8 bottles."

01:42:20.875 --> 01:42:23.036
"Awesome, 20 bottles for me."

01:42:37.125 --> 01:42:40.117
"There's finally hope!"

01:43:01.792 --> 01:43:02.872
Brother yong,

01:43:03.333 --> 01:43:04.413
there are so many patients.

01:43:04.625 --> 01:43:06.545
You will lose hundreds of
thousands every month.

01:43:06.917 --> 01:43:08.202
I'm paying them back.

01:43:11.042 --> 01:43:13.499
Tell liu to place the order.

01:43:38.417 --> 01:43:40.257
You need to take care of
yourself from now on.

01:43:41.125 --> 01:43:44.117
Give me a call once you see
your mom at the terminal.

01:43:44.750 --> 01:43:45.750
Ok.

01:43:45.792 --> 01:43:46.792
Don't cry.

01:43:47.708 --> 01:43:48.708
Be a man.

01:43:52.792 --> 01:43:54.032
Goodbye, daddy.

01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:00.500
Go ahead.

01:44:09.708 --> 01:44:11.289
It's good for him to go abroad.

01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:13.490
He'll have better prospects than us.

01:44:19.167 --> 01:44:21.499
Would you like a drink?

01:44:22.250 --> 01:44:23.581
Maybe next time.

01:44:43.333 --> 01:44:44.413
Yong!

01:44:44.625 --> 01:44:45.625
Brother yong!

01:44:56.542 --> 01:44:58.373
Police! Nobody moves!

01:44:59.208 --> 01:45:00.414
What are you waiting for? Run!

01:45:00.542 --> 01:45:02.828
I repeat. Put everything
down and stand still!

01:45:04.167 --> 01:45:05.577
Stop! Do you hear me!

01:45:05.917 --> 01:45:06.952
Stop now!

01:45:12.667 --> 01:45:13.622
Get out the car! Hurry up!

01:45:13.625 --> 01:45:15.115
Get out!

01:45:16.750 --> 01:45:17.910
Get out!

01:45:20.792 --> 01:45:21.912
Put your hands on your head!

01:45:27.833 --> 01:45:28.833
Cuff him!

01:45:33.417 --> 01:45:34.417
Freeze!

01:45:35.500 --> 01:45:36.500
Don't move!

01:45:38.875 --> 01:45:40.035
Don't move! Get down!

01:45:43.417 --> 01:45:45.373
Therefore, I would like to remind the court

01:45:45.375 --> 01:45:48.822
that it is nuowa company that has
saved the lives of cml patients

01:45:48.833 --> 01:45:50.448
rather than the Indian copycat drug,

01:45:50.458 --> 01:45:51.823
let alone the defendant.

01:45:51.833 --> 01:45:52.993
What he did

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.491
has led to the flooding of
counterfeit drugs nationwide

01:45:55.500 --> 01:45:57.582
and severely violated
international intellectual property law.

01:45:57.583 --> 01:46:00.370
The defendant must be severely punished.

01:46:01.083 --> 01:46:02.368
I rest my case.

01:46:03.292 --> 01:46:04.292
Defense counsel.

01:46:05.750 --> 01:46:08.867
Although my client
has violated laws and regulations,

01:46:08.875 --> 01:46:12.572
about one thousand cml patients

01:46:12.583 --> 01:46:15.450
have survived over the past year.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.661
The global sales price of glinic

01:46:17.667 --> 01:46:18.873
is so high

01:46:21.917 --> 01:46:23.532
is their pricing

01:46:23.542 --> 01:46:24.748
reasonable?

01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:27.036
We want to affirm

01:46:27.042 --> 01:46:29.249
that the intention of Cheng
yong is to save lives

01:46:29.375 --> 01:46:30.615
rather than to make any profit.

01:46:31.583 --> 01:46:32.743
I rest my case.

01:46:34.542 --> 01:46:35.542
Defendant,

01:46:36.292 --> 01:46:38.052
is there anything else
that you want to say?

01:46:40.375 --> 01:46:43.913
If not, we will be in
recess for ten minutes.

01:46:44.458 --> 01:46:47.325
Then the court will pronounce the sentence.

01:47:03.125 --> 01:47:04.365
I violated the law

01:47:06.958 --> 01:47:08.619
and so I deserve the punishment.

01:47:09.625 --> 01:47:10.910
I have no complaint about it.

01:47:15.208 --> 01:47:16.208
But,

01:47:17.125 --> 01:47:18.786
when I see these patients,

01:47:19.292 --> 01:47:20.782
I feel so sad for them.

01:47:22.083 --> 01:47:24.415
They can't afford
the ultra-high-priced imported drugs.

01:47:26.333 --> 01:47:28.289
They have no choice but to wait for death,

01:47:30.875 --> 01:47:32.411
some even commit suicide.

01:47:36.375 --> 01:47:37.410
However,

01:47:38.417 --> 01:47:41.124
I believe things will get
better in the future.

01:47:44.167 --> 01:47:45.452
I'll keep my fingers crossed

01:47:45.875 --> 01:47:47.285
that it'll be coming soon.

01:47:58.958 --> 01:48:00.368
Please tell xiaoshu

01:48:01.292 --> 01:48:02.702
his dad is not a bad guy.

01:48:05.833 --> 01:48:06.868
Many thanks.

01:48:36.125 --> 01:48:37.125
Slow down.

01:49:03.375 --> 01:49:05.095
The court shall pronounce the sentence now.

01:49:05.333 --> 01:49:06.869
The defendant Cheng yong

01:49:07.333 --> 01:49:09.289
is convicted of trafficking

01:49:09.292 --> 01:49:11.533
and selling counterfeit medicines,

01:49:11.542 --> 01:49:13.658
with sufficient evidence of crime

01:49:13.667 --> 01:49:15.373
and established corpus delicti.

01:49:15.750 --> 01:49:16.865
In the meantime,

01:49:16.875 --> 01:49:19.491
as to what Cheng yong has
done to help the patients

01:49:19.500 --> 01:49:21.786
purchase illicit medication,

01:49:21.792 --> 01:49:24.408
the court gives a certain
degree of understanding.

01:49:24.792 --> 01:49:26.373
For all the above,

01:49:26.375 --> 01:49:28.582
the defendant Cheng yong

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:30.786
is sentenced to five years

01:49:30.792 --> 01:49:32.123
in prison.

01:51:10.583 --> 01:51:12.995
"This case has drawn great attention
from the officials."

01:51:13.083 --> 01:51:14.994
"Cheng yong had his sentence commuted.”

01:51:15.083 --> 01:51:17.476
"The government continued promoting the
reform of medical system.”

01:51:17.500 --> 01:51:20.572
"A large number of cml patients have been
effectively rescued successively."

01:51:27.708 --> 01:51:30.905
"Three years later”

01:51:47.250 --> 01:51:48.740
I quit.

01:51:50.792 --> 01:51:52.123
Wanna go for a drink?

01:51:52.125 --> 01:51:53.125
Sure.

01:51:55.417 --> 01:51:56.782
Have you got a plan?

01:51:57.208 --> 01:51:58.243
Not yet.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:00.410
Don't sell fake drugs anymore.

01:52:00.417 --> 01:52:01.497
Nobody is gonna buy it now.

01:52:01.667 --> 01:52:02.747
What's going on?

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:04.536
The real drugs are covered
by medical insurance now.

01:52:04.542 --> 01:52:06.032
No one takes Indian drugs anymore.

01:52:08.667 --> 01:52:10.032
That's good.

01:52:10.917 --> 01:52:12.578
Go back to selling love drugs.

01:52:12.583 --> 01:52:13.868
Suits you well.

01:52:25.083 --> 01:52:26.539
"In 2012, 120 doctors
from different countries”

01:52:26.542 --> 01:52:29.309
"issued a joint protest on the American magazine
blood for the excessive pricing of glinic."

01:52:29.333 --> 01:52:32.559

patent litigation from Swiss Nova for glinic."
