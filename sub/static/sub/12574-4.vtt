00:01.070 --> 00:04.670
Richard Cypher,
you are the true seeker.

00:04.671 --> 00:08.071

00:37.072 --> 00:48.672
(chanting)

00:55.673 --> 00:58.673
People have tried for years
to find the Forest of the Night Wisp's.

00:59.174 --> 01:00.474
Had you come here on your own,

01:00.475 --> 01:02.175
they'd have never shown themselves.

01:02.676 --> 01:04.876
They only come out
for those they trust.

01:06.377 --> 01:08.477
I come to ask you for your help.

01:10.778 --> 01:12.578
A dreamcaster sent me a message

01:12.579 --> 01:14.579
that said I'd be the last Confessor.

01:16.880 --> 01:18.080
I need to know

01:18.081 --> 01:20.481
if there are any Confessors still alive.

01:23.282 --> 01:24.482
Will you help me find them?

01:30.183 --> 01:31.883
May the spirits protect you.

01:51.584 --> 01:53.284
You're beautiful.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.585
Are you trying to tell me something?

02:01.386 --> 02:02.586
( door opens )

02:06.087 --> 02:09.086
( ominous theme playing )

02:09.088 --> 02:10.288
Who were you talking to?

02:10.889 --> 02:11.889
Myself.

02:12.990 --> 02:14.790
Who else do I have to talk to?

02:15.291 --> 02:16.691
It is late, get some sleep.

02:16.692 --> 02:18.892
Father, I'm almost a grown woman.

02:20.893 --> 02:22.893
I can't stay here forever.

02:23.694 --> 02:25.594
I want to travel to distant lands,

02:25.595 --> 02:29.195
and fall in love, and get married.

02:29.196 --> 02:30.496
That will never happen, Annabelle.

02:31.997 --> 02:32.597
( sighs )

02:32.598 --> 02:33.898
You're safe here.

02:34.799 --> 02:36.199
That is all that matters.

03:09.300 --> 03:10.300
What is it?

03:10.801 --> 03:12.201
The Night Wisp searched everywhere

03:12.202 --> 03:14.902
in the Midlands and beyond
looking for another Confessor.

03:16.103 --> 03:17.703
But they only found one.

03:19.004 --> 03:19.904
Only one.

03:20.105 --> 03:22.405
Then who is this other Confessor.

03:22.406 --> 03:23.506
It's strange.

03:24.607 --> 03:26.107
The Night Wisp
didn't know who she was.

03:26.108 --> 03:27.508
At least she's still alive.

03:27.509 --> 03:28.709
But for how long?

03:30.410 --> 03:31.610
She's in a tower.

03:31.611 --> 03:33.611
in Lonville Castle, in Ausridge.

03:34.412 --> 03:35.912
Sounds like she's a prisoner.

03:36.113 --> 03:37.513
We can be there and back
in three days.

03:38.914 --> 03:39.614
Ausridge?

03:39.615 --> 03:41.015
I've traveled across the Midlands

03:41.016 --> 03:42.416
with you people for weeks now

03:42.417 --> 03:44.117
because you said you had to get me

03:44.118 --> 03:45.918
and this thing on my hand

03:45.919 --> 03:48.419
to Bemoord to find your
precious Stone of Tears.

03:48.420 --> 03:50.820
But instead, we're going to Ausridge?

03:50.821 --> 03:53.121
Perhaps before we see
about this Confessor

03:53.222 --> 03:56.922
we should get the Stone and
rid ourselves of extraneous cargo.

03:57.623 --> 03:59.923
I'll go and meet with you in Pamorah.

03:59.924 --> 04:01.124
You're not going alone.

04:01.125 --> 04:02.025
Zedd

04:02.126 --> 04:03.626
You and Cara can go to Pamorah

04:03.627 --> 04:05.327
Owen, you can come with us.

04:05.428 --> 04:06.428
What!

04:06.629 --> 04:07.829
Why?

04:07.830 --> 04:08.830
I've been thinking...

04:08.831 --> 04:09.731
we know this Roan has a key

04:09.732 --> 04:10.732
but we don't know what it opens

04:10.733 --> 04:13.733
or who or what might try to stop
us from getting it.

04:13.934 --> 04:15.134
You and Cara should find out

04:15.135 --> 04:18.135
before we put the rune or Flynn
in harm's way.

04:20.136 --> 04:21.435
We'll meet back here in three days.

04:37.537 --> 04:38.637
Thank you, Tharla.

04:45.271 --> 04:49.506
<i>( ominous theme playing )</i>

04:53.312 --> 04:56.346
( grunting )

04:56.414 --> 04:57.682
Father.

04:57.750 --> 05:00.285
- Help him.
- It's just a sleeping potion.

05:00.353 --> 05:01.687
I had to set you free,
Annabelle.

05:02.155 --> 05:02.688
But...

05:02.756 --> 05:04.623
He'll keep you locked
up forever.

05:05.391 --> 05:07.659
We must hurry.
Before his men catch us.

05:12.465 --> 05:13.632
(Agnes)
You're too late.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.635
The servant Tharla
poisoned his Lordship.

05:16.702 --> 05:19.304
He's dead. She took Annabelle.

05:19.772 --> 05:20.639
Took her where?

05:20.907 --> 05:22.340
I don't know.
They rode away,

05:22.508 --> 05:23.976
taking the fastest horses.

05:24.444 --> 05:26.244
Annabelle?
She's a Confessor?

05:27.012 --> 05:28.080
How did you know?

05:28.147 --> 05:29.448
Was she a prisoner here?

05:30.516 --> 05:32.017
She was Lord Callum's daughter.

05:33.585 --> 05:34.686
Years ago, Lord Callum

05:34.754 --> 05:36.989
was a powerful
D'Haran commander.

05:37.657 --> 05:39.458
He attacked
a neighboring village.

05:40.926 --> 05:43.195
But the villagers
had the Confessor Josephine

05:43.263 --> 05:44.630
on their side.

05:45.198 --> 05:47.400
She confessed
Lord Callum in battle.

05:47.467 --> 05:51.403
( dramatic theme playing )

05:51.971 --> 05:54.273
He was betrothed
to a beautiful duchess,

05:54.341 --> 05:56.942
a woman he'd loved
since childhood.

05:57.209 --> 05:59.177
But once Callum was confessed,

05:59.245 --> 06:01.947
he thought of no one
but Josephine.

06:02.314 --> 06:04.083
She took him as her mate.

06:04.650 --> 06:06.318
Soon she was with child.

06:06.485 --> 06:07.253
( screaming )

06:07.320 --> 06:09.922
(Agnes)
But the birth was not an easy one.

06:10.090 --> 06:14.391
( baby crying )

06:15.094 --> 06:16.295
(Agnes)
And when she died,

06:17.663 --> 06:19.831
he was released.

06:24.436 --> 06:27.239
He suddenly realized
everything he had lost

06:27.406 --> 06:29.207
when he became confessed.

06:30.675 --> 06:32.543
( panting )

06:33.113 --> 06:35.214
Feed her to the crows.

06:35.381 --> 06:37.983
I feared he might
kill the child too,

06:38.551 --> 06:39.885
he was in such rage.

06:40.653 --> 06:42.921
But Lord Callum could not
bring himself to slay

06:42.989 --> 06:44.890
his own flesh and blood.

06:45.357 --> 06:50.229
He swore that no one would ever
suffer at his daughter's hands

06:51.297 --> 06:52.865
as he did at her mother's.

06:54.033 --> 06:56.401
He hid her away
for her whole life

06:56.969 --> 06:59.872
in the tallest tower
of the castle.

07:01.439 --> 07:03.042
He never told her
of her powers.

07:04.009 --> 07:06.044
Her curse, as he called it.

07:08.147 --> 07:09.280
We have to find her.

07:09.348 --> 07:10.983
They can't have gotten far.

07:14.119 --> 07:15.453
( animal squeaks )

07:17.990 --> 07:19.157
Where are we going?

07:19.525 --> 07:21.159
Someplace safe.

07:30.703 --> 07:32.170
Why are we here?

07:32.238 --> 07:36.039
<i>( ominous theme playing )</i>

07:36.942 --> 07:38.977
I see you've brought the girl.

07:39.044 --> 07:41.346
A hundred gold pieces
was our agreement.

07:41.714 --> 07:43.115
What agreement?

07:44.183 --> 07:45.683
What are you doing?

07:45.751 --> 07:47.986
I need proof that she is
what you say she is.

07:48.054 --> 07:49.454
She doesn't know what she is.

07:49.522 --> 07:50.989
She's never used her powers.

07:51.257 --> 07:52.057
What powers?

07:52.825 --> 07:54.360
A demonstration
won't be necessary.

07:54.628 --> 07:56.395
(Annabelle)
I don't have any powers.

08:03.702 --> 08:06.837
<i>( mysterious theme playing )</i>

08:11.677 --> 08:14.111
What are you doing to me?

08:24.824 --> 08:26.492
All right, that's enough.

08:27.559 --> 08:28.560
No more until you pay.

08:30.096 --> 08:31.763
Or he kills the girl.

08:33.999 --> 08:35.265
No, no.

08:35.333 --> 08:37.269
I have enough
to see if it's genuine.

08:53.919 --> 08:58.155
( tense theme playing )

09:10.803 --> 09:13.470
( panting )

09:16.008 --> 09:18.709
( grunts )

09:22.147 --> 09:25.283
Master, how can I serve you?

09:29.755 --> 09:32.857
Kill...her.

09:33.025 --> 09:33.992
No.

09:36.829 --> 09:39.163
( grunts )

09:41.567 --> 09:45.670
<i>( dramatic theme playing )</i>

09:45.738 --> 09:48.473
You're going
to be very useful to me.

09:48.541 --> 09:49.975
(Richard)
Let her go!

09:51.043 --> 09:52.177
The Seeker.

09:52.244 --> 09:53.545
And the Mother Confessor.

09:54.013 --> 09:55.647
Kill him and take her.

09:56.715 --> 09:59.316
( all grunting )

10:03.522 --> 10:05.556
Hide her.

10:05.624 --> 10:08.492
( grunts )

10:09.528 --> 10:10.795
(Richard)
Run!

10:10.863 --> 10:13.130
( all grunting )

10:13.699 --> 10:16.433
- Run, Annabelle!
- Get her!

10:17.836 --> 10:21.638
<i>( dramatic theme playing )</i>

10:24.443 --> 10:26.443
( grunts )

10:30.816 --> 10:34.384
( both grunting )

10:35.320 --> 10:38.356
Are you all right?

10:38.424 --> 10:40.058
Where did you come from?

10:40.125 --> 10:44.095
Oh, I just wait around in trees
hoping to rescue pretty girls.

10:44.163 --> 10:46.464
Think you can stand?

10:46.532 --> 10:49.167
( men grunting )

10:58.043 --> 11:02.012
<i>( dramatic theme playing )</i>

11:02.247 --> 11:04.182

11:04.249 --> 11:07.316
Richard!

11:05.384 --> 11:07.452
<i>( tender theme playing )</i>

11:11.323 --> 11:13.224
Are you a prince?

11:13.292 --> 11:15.993
Is it that obvious?

11:19.598 --> 11:21.365
(Kahlan)
Are you all right?

11:23.936 --> 11:26.537
Let them go.
We have to get Annabelle.

11:36.849 --> 11:38.149
( thunder crashes )

11:38.217 --> 11:41.486
<i>( dramatic theme playing )</i>

11:47.293 --> 11:49.560
Annabelle, no!

11:49.628 --> 11:51.761
Flynn.

11:57.436 --> 12:00.103
Command me, Confessor.

12:01.473 --> 12:03.040
( sighs )

12:04.606 --> 12:06.907
- What's wrong with him?
- He's been confessed.

12:06.975 --> 12:09.243
Not your fault. You don't have
control over your powers yet.

12:09.311 --> 12:11.312
What powers?
You're a Confessor.

12:11.380 --> 12:13.780
Just like I am.

12:14.748 --> 12:15.682
Confessor?

12:15.750 --> 12:17.283
When you touch someone
with your powers,

12:17.351 --> 12:18.618
they become enslaved to you.

12:18.686 --> 12:20.687
They lose their free will.

12:20.755 --> 12:22.155
(Annabelle)
I did that?

12:22.223 --> 12:23.523
I enslaved him?

12:23.591 --> 12:26.126
I'm glad you did.

12:26.193 --> 12:28.461
I want to serve you.

12:28.529 --> 12:31.331
How do I take it away?
(Kahlan) You can't.

12:31.399 --> 12:34.567
He'll be confessed to you
for the rest of your life.

12:36.070 --> 12:37.804
I didn't know.

12:37.872 --> 12:38.972
Your father didn't tell you

12:39.039 --> 12:40.640
because he was afraid
of your powers.

12:40.708 --> 12:42.242
That's why he kept you
locked in a tower.

12:42.309 --> 12:43.610
You talked to my father?

12:47.381 --> 12:49.015
I'm so sorry, Annabelle.

12:50.584 --> 12:52.352
Your father is dead.

12:52.420 --> 12:54.554
Dead?

12:54.622 --> 12:56.222
He was poisoned.

12:59.693 --> 13:01.928
Tharla killed him.

13:01.996 --> 13:03.963
So she could sell me
to that sorcerer.

13:04.031 --> 13:05.498
(Richard)
He wanted to take your magic.

13:05.566 --> 13:06.866
But don't worry.

13:06.934 --> 13:08.301
He won't come near you again.

13:08.369 --> 13:10.437
We're gonna take you to a place
where you can be trained.

13:10.504 --> 13:11.571
- Trained?
- So they can teach you

13:11.639 --> 13:12.872
how to control your magic,

13:12.940 --> 13:15.008
so nothing like this
will ever happen again.

13:15.075 --> 13:16.543
Stop. You're scaring her.

13:16.610 --> 13:18.912
She just found
out her father died.

13:18.979 --> 13:21.614
She needs to know
everything's all right.

13:21.682 --> 13:26.119
I won't let anything
bad happen to you. Ever.

13:26.187 --> 13:32.025
Annabelle, you have a
very rare and special gift.

13:32.092 --> 13:36.763
If I can teach you about it,
if you'll come with us...

13:36.831 --> 13:40.366
It's all right.

13:40.434 --> 13:42.202
They're good people.

13:46.474 --> 13:47.974
I'll go wherever he goes.

13:49.677 --> 13:51.744
Come on.

13:58.652 --> 14:00.920
(Zedd)
Excuse me, sir.

14:00.988 --> 14:02.422
Pardon me, madam.

14:02.490 --> 14:04.390
You and your Agiels

14:04.458 --> 14:06.459
don't exactly inspire
a warm welcome.

14:06.527 --> 14:08.661
I've learned it's more useful
to be feared than liked.

14:08.729 --> 14:09.829
Excuse me, sir.

14:09.897 --> 14:11.498
- What do you want?
- Could you tell us

14:11.565 --> 14:13.566
where we could find
the Cloister of Pamorah?

14:13.634 --> 14:16.269
In the Sentinel Hills,
east of the city.

14:16.337 --> 14:17.670
But I wouldn't go now.

14:17.738 --> 14:19.606
You don't wanna be
on the road after nightfall.

14:19.673 --> 14:22.408
W-Wait, sir, w-why?

14:25.946 --> 14:28.281
(Zedd)
Thank you for seeing me,
Miss Prioress.

14:28.349 --> 14:31.518
Have you seen
this symbol before?

14:31.585 --> 14:33.686
The parchment will
do you no good.

14:33.754 --> 14:35.955
The tomb must
be opened by the one

14:36.023 --> 14:37.557
who bears the rune
on his hand.

14:37.625 --> 14:38.992
What tomb?

14:39.059 --> 14:40.493
In times past,

14:40.561 --> 14:43.129
the tomb was the site
of many a pilgrimage.

14:43.197 --> 14:46.165
Legend has it the Stone of Tears
was buried there.

14:46.233 --> 14:50.303
Darken Rahl sent his men
to Pamorah to open the tomb.

14:50.371 --> 14:52.505
They tried everything,

14:52.573 --> 14:54.908
but no one
could get inside it.

14:54.975 --> 14:56.843
Without the rune.

14:56.911 --> 14:58.244
Rahl believed
the bearer of the rune

14:58.312 --> 14:59.712
would arrive one day,

14:59.780 --> 15:04.551
so he stationed an elite guard
around the tomb.

15:04.618 --> 15:08.154
After Rahl fell, the villagers
rose up, and killed them.

15:08.222 --> 15:11.124
Every last D'Haran.

15:11.191 --> 15:14.260
But they came back
from the dead.

15:14.328 --> 15:17.530
Banelings.

15:17.598 --> 15:20.066
That's what everyone around
here is so afraid of.

15:20.134 --> 15:23.369
They accepted the Keeper's
twisted bargain.

15:23.437 --> 15:25.605
Killing to stay alive.

15:25.673 --> 15:27.006
They're still waiting

15:27.074 --> 15:29.375
for the bearer
of the rune to arrive.

15:29.443 --> 15:32.312
To make sure no one
gets the stone.

15:32.379 --> 15:34.247
Where is this tomb?

15:34.315 --> 15:37.183
In a cemetery, to the south.

15:37.251 --> 15:39.352
But going anywhere
near it means certain death.

15:44.758 --> 15:47.427
( Annabelle chuckles )

15:47.494 --> 15:50.029
I wonder where
Flynn's family is?

15:50.097 --> 15:52.231
I never asked him.

15:54.101 --> 15:56.069
It's not your fault
this happened.

15:57.705 --> 16:00.573
We took him with us
because we needed him.

16:00.641 --> 16:03.242
Now he'll spend the rest
of his life desperately longing

16:03.310 --> 16:06.079
for someone he'll
never see again.

16:06.146 --> 16:07.413
( sighs )

16:07.481 --> 16:08.982
Well, maybe after Pamorah...

16:09.049 --> 16:11.250
No.

16:11.318 --> 16:13.586
No.

16:13.654 --> 16:15.922
Flynn will be a distraction.

16:17.725 --> 16:19.892
( laughs )

16:19.960 --> 16:22.695
My whole life
I wanted to see the world.

16:22.763 --> 16:25.398
And now that I'm out here,

16:25.466 --> 16:27.934
I don't understand any of it.

16:28.002 --> 16:30.336
I'll teach you.

16:32.206 --> 16:34.073
( laughs )

16:37.478 --> 16:39.579
Kahlan says I have
to go to a place

16:39.647 --> 16:41.114
called Aydindril to be trained.

16:41.181 --> 16:43.516
- I'll come with you.
- She says you can't.

16:43.584 --> 16:45.284
That you have something
more important to do

16:45.352 --> 16:47.887
in Pamorah with Richard.

16:47.955 --> 16:49.689
I don't want to go
anywhere without you.

16:51.325 --> 16:52.592
Then you'll get your wish.

16:54.261 --> 16:55.528
How?

16:55.596 --> 16:59.098
(Kahlan)
It's late.

16:59.166 --> 17:02.001
We all need some sleep.

17:02.069 --> 17:03.736
My mistress is cold.

17:03.804 --> 17:05.872
I'm gonna get some more wood
for the fire.

17:09.276 --> 17:11.810
Maybe Flynn and I can get married.

17:11.878 --> 17:15.248
I'm sorry, Annabelle.

17:15.315 --> 17:18.151
That isn't going to happen.

17:18.218 --> 17:20.086
But he loves me.

17:20.154 --> 17:21.654
And I love him.

17:21.722 --> 17:22.954
And in the books I've read...

17:23.022 --> 17:26.192
It isn't the same with Confessors.

17:26.260 --> 17:28.194
We serve a higher purpose.

17:28.262 --> 17:32.799
But our gift makes the kind
of romance you've read about...

17:32.866 --> 17:34.901
...impossible.

17:34.968 --> 17:36.769
So you can't get married?

17:36.837 --> 17:38.471
A Confessor takes a mate,

17:38.539 --> 17:41.674
but not for love.

17:41.742 --> 17:43.876
To continue our line.

17:43.944 --> 17:48.281
And there aren't
very many of us left.

17:48.348 --> 17:50.917
I think you and I may be
the only ones.

17:50.984 --> 17:54.921
So one day, when you're ready,
you'll take a suitable mate.

17:54.988 --> 17:57.056
What makes a mate suitable?

17:57.124 --> 18:01.527
Well, uh, he should be

18:01.595 --> 18:05.398
strong, noble and brave.

18:07.401 --> 18:09.102
A leader.

18:09.169 --> 18:11.337
So Richard's your mate, then?

18:12.973 --> 18:14.407
No.

18:14.475 --> 18:17.343
I love Richard,
but if he and I

18:17.411 --> 18:19.712
were to be together
in that way,

18:19.780 --> 18:21.514
he would become confessed.

18:21.582 --> 18:23.449
But he already loves you.

18:23.517 --> 18:26.986
Richard has an important mission
only he can carry out.

18:28.589 --> 18:30.857
If he were confessed,

18:30.924 --> 18:35.361
his love for me would be
all-consuming.

18:35.429 --> 18:38.364
It would distract him so much
he would go mad.

18:38.432 --> 18:40.867
And he couldn't
complete his quest.

18:40.934 --> 18:43.369
So you can never
be with someone you love?

18:46.740 --> 18:48.574
Once you start your training

18:48.642 --> 18:50.376
and see how
important our work is,

18:50.444 --> 18:51.844
you'll understand
that it makes up

18:51.912 --> 18:53.780
for the things we can't have.

18:53.847 --> 18:55.281
( Flynn panting, grunting )

18:55.349 --> 18:56.616
The sorcerer's men!

18:56.683 --> 18:57.884
They're coming!

18:57.951 --> 18:59.085
( groaning )

18:59.153 --> 19:00.186
Keep her safe!

19:02.156 --> 19:03.790
Come on.

19:03.857 --> 19:05.124
What are you doing?

19:05.192 --> 19:06.893
Granting your wish.

19:10.864 --> 19:13.766
There's no one here.

19:13.834 --> 19:15.635
Flynn.
( grunts )

19:21.642 --> 19:22.742
(Kahlan)
They're gone.

19:22.810 --> 19:24.210
And so are the horses.

19:30.317 --> 19:32.919
( Flynn grunts )

19:32.986 --> 19:34.954
You're bleeding.

19:35.022 --> 19:36.722
I had to make it look real.

19:36.790 --> 19:38.558
I fooled them
so that we could get away.

19:38.625 --> 19:39.959
Isn't that what you wanted?

19:43.030 --> 19:45.364
Does it hurt?

19:45.432 --> 19:48.334
For you, nothing hurts.

19:55.766 --> 19:57.367
When I was in the tower,

19:57.435 --> 20:00.670
the servants used to secretly
bring me books to read.

20:00.738 --> 20:03.673
Have you ever heard the story
of Rosalind and Palomar?

20:03.741 --> 20:05.842
Yeah, everybody knows that story.

20:05.910 --> 20:08.511
She saved him from the dragon.

20:08.579 --> 20:10.980
And then they sail away
on the ocean together.

20:11.048 --> 20:14.617
You remind me of Palomar.

20:14.685 --> 20:16.586
At least the way I imagined him.

20:16.654 --> 20:18.288
I'd save you from a dragon.

20:18.356 --> 20:19.823
( laughs )

20:19.890 --> 20:21.324
Would you take me
to see the ocean?

20:22.860 --> 20:25.662
I'd take you anywhere.

20:29.633 --> 20:30.900
What?

20:33.704 --> 20:36.439
This rune is the key
to finding the Stone of Tears.

20:36.507 --> 20:38.274
Unless Richard has it,

20:38.342 --> 20:40.343
the Keeper will destroy all life.

20:40.411 --> 20:41.778
Including yours.

20:41.846 --> 20:43.646
Maybe we should go back.

20:43.714 --> 20:46.416
How do you know
what they told you is true?

20:46.484 --> 20:49.285
My father told me there
was nothing but war

20:49.353 --> 20:50.653
and wickedness in this world.

20:50.721 --> 20:53.490
That was a lie.

20:53.557 --> 20:55.859
You're proof of that.

20:57.895 --> 21:00.196
And even if what
they're saying is true,

21:00.264 --> 21:02.365
I'd rather die with you

21:02.433 --> 21:07.036
than be locked
in another tower without you.

21:10.207 --> 21:12.776
( tender theme playing )

21:14.779 --> 21:16.446
I should've separated
them right away.

21:16.514 --> 21:18.715
He was comforting a scared girl.
It would have been cruel.

21:18.783 --> 21:20.283
She would have been safe.

21:20.351 --> 21:21.885
We'll find them.

21:21.952 --> 21:24.854
Look.
The tracks split.

21:24.922 --> 21:27.323
One horse went north.
The other east.

21:27.391 --> 21:29.392
He was trying to make it harder
for us to follow him.

21:29.460 --> 21:31.528
- Clever.
- Not clever enough.

21:31.595 --> 21:33.496
These tracks are deeper.

21:33.564 --> 21:35.498
The horse that went that way
wasn't carrying any weight.

21:40.438 --> 21:41.871
(Flynn)
Hungry?

21:41.939 --> 21:43.540
Wait here.

21:53.984 --> 21:56.586
( grunts )

21:56.654 --> 21:58.822
You know what we do
with thieves around here?

21:58.889 --> 21:59.956
Show them mercy?

22:03.360 --> 22:04.260
Flynn!

22:07.064 --> 22:10.033
Well. Two thieves.

22:10.100 --> 22:12.368
Maybe you've got something
to bargain with.

22:12.436 --> 22:14.737
Stay away from her.

22:14.805 --> 22:16.773
( grunts )

22:16.841 --> 22:18.842
<i>( dramatic theme playing )</i>

22:29.086 --> 22:31.454
Command me, Confessor.

22:31.522 --> 22:32.922
(man)
Hey!

22:34.492 --> 22:36.292
Stop them.

22:40.598 --> 22:41.998
( men grunting )

22:52.443 --> 22:55.211
( suspenseful theme playing )

23:02.553 --> 23:05.188
The only way to kill banelings
is to burn them.

23:05.256 --> 23:06.623
We'll need oil and torches.

23:06.690 --> 23:09.692
Why not just use Wizard's Fire?

23:09.760 --> 23:11.494
I don't think
that would be wise.

23:13.797 --> 23:16.032
It's because I'm a Mord-Sith,
isn't it?

23:16.100 --> 23:18.635
You think if you
use your magic,

23:18.702 --> 23:20.136
I'll turn it against you.

23:21.572 --> 23:23.206
I've had chances before.

23:23.274 --> 23:25.642
With the Seeker
and Confessor nearby.

23:25.709 --> 23:27.810
And now you know
where the tomb is.

23:27.878 --> 23:30.280
(Cara)
Do you honestly think that's why

23:30.347 --> 23:32.682
I've followed Richard
all this way?

23:32.750 --> 23:34.918
In the hopes
that he'd send me here

23:34.985 --> 23:37.887
with you alone
so that I could find a way

23:37.955 --> 23:40.590
to steal the stone for myself?

23:40.658 --> 23:42.225
Probably not.

23:42.293 --> 23:44.294
But what's at stake
is far too important

23:44.361 --> 23:46.696
to rely on probability.

23:46.764 --> 23:49.499
I don't believe you have
the luxury of caution.

23:53.003 --> 23:54.304
( all scream )

23:58.008 --> 23:59.409
Get them!

23:59.476 --> 24:03.046
( action theme playing )

24:09.420 --> 24:11.521
( men grunting )

24:14.992 --> 24:15.992
( screams )

24:24.268 --> 24:26.102
I think that's all of them.

24:27.738 --> 24:30.473
For now.
But this is a place of death.

24:30.541 --> 24:34.177
Others may crawl out
of the earth to replace them.

24:38.315 --> 24:39.749
We should get
Flynn back here

24:39.817 --> 24:41.851
with the rune
as quickly as we can.

24:41.919 --> 24:43.419
We?

24:43.487 --> 24:44.754
Are you sure
you can trust me?

24:44.822 --> 24:47.390
No. But I don't have
the luxury of caution.

24:51.962 --> 24:53.630
( thunder rumbling )

24:53.697 --> 24:54.931
( all chattering )

24:58.769 --> 25:01.070
(Richard)
Flynn. Annabelle.

25:01.138 --> 25:03.906
I know this is hard for you,
but we have to get moving.

25:03.974 --> 25:05.308
We've lost enough time as it is.

25:07.277 --> 25:09.712
If you don't leave,

25:09.780 --> 25:11.147
my friends
will make you leave.

25:11.215 --> 25:14.450
( dramatic theme playing )

25:19.490 --> 25:21.324
Richard, they're all confessed.

25:21.392 --> 25:22.959
Let's go.

25:25.696 --> 25:26.796
( all grunting )

25:37.141 --> 25:38.775
What's wrong?

25:38.842 --> 25:41.177
I know Richard and Kahlan.

25:41.245 --> 25:44.781
Sooner or later, they'll catch us.

25:44.848 --> 25:47.650
( tense theme playing )

25:47.718 --> 25:49.485
( all grunting )

25:56.827 --> 25:58.594
(Richard)
Kahlan!

26:01.632 --> 26:04.567
( all grunting )

26:09.673 --> 26:13.943
( dramatic theme playing )

26:14.011 --> 26:15.478
No!

26:23.620 --> 26:26.789
Richard!

26:26.857 --> 26:29.392
( both grunt )

26:29.460 --> 26:31.461
Richard?

26:32.963 --> 26:34.697
Richard.

26:41.105 --> 26:44.307
( tense theme playing )

26:46.777 --> 26:48.678
Mistress...

26:50.948 --> 26:52.982
...how can I serve you?

26:53.050 --> 26:55.585
( dramatic theme playing )

26:59.334 --> 27:00.701
Are you hurt?

27:00.769 --> 27:02.837
I'm fine. Let's go.

27:02.904 --> 27:05.039
(Richard)
I'll come with you, Mistress.

27:05.107 --> 27:08.309
Everything he does
is to save lives.

27:08.376 --> 27:10.578
He saved yours.

27:10.645 --> 27:13.714
And you've destroyed him.

27:13.782 --> 27:15.583
I'm sorry, Kahlan.

27:15.650 --> 27:17.118
But you didn't leave me a choice.

27:18.653 --> 27:20.588
And you leave me no choice.

27:22.290 --> 27:23.891
( Kahlan grunts )

27:23.959 --> 27:26.494
- I won't let you kill her.
- Kill me?

27:26.561 --> 27:28.529
It's the only way to release me
from Confession.

27:28.597 --> 27:30.030
But don't worry Mistress.
I'll protect you.

27:30.098 --> 27:31.465
Richard, I don't want
to fight you.

27:31.533 --> 27:33.501
Then put down your weapon.

27:40.842 --> 27:43.377
I'll get the horse.

27:46.114 --> 27:47.848
What are you doing?
Don't hurt him.

27:47.916 --> 27:48.949
Let him go.

27:49.017 --> 27:50.384
You will order
both of these men

27:50.452 --> 27:52.386
to come with me
to Pamorah right now,

27:52.454 --> 27:53.854
or I will kill him.

27:53.922 --> 27:56.690
You wouldn't hurt him. You need
the rune on his hand.

27:56.758 --> 27:57.958
(Kahlan)
I need him in Pamorah.

27:58.026 --> 28:00.194
If he doesn't go,
he's of no use to me.

28:01.797 --> 28:06.200
If we go with you
and Flynn gets you your stone,

28:06.268 --> 28:08.769
will you let us be together?

28:08.837 --> 28:10.304
You have my word.

28:10.372 --> 28:11.906
It's a trap.

28:11.973 --> 28:13.908
She'll try to kill you
the first chance she gets.

28:13.975 --> 28:16.811
Richard, I know you're confessed
to her, but you know me.

28:16.878 --> 28:19.847
I'm not a liar.

28:22.317 --> 28:24.552
No, she isn't.

28:27.489 --> 28:29.690
Put your sword down.

28:29.758 --> 28:31.425
We're going with her.

28:39.534 --> 28:41.802
( sighs )

28:41.870 --> 28:43.470
(Kahlan)
She said she'd order Flynn

28:43.538 --> 28:45.206
to go to Pamorah with us
if I let them live.

28:45.273 --> 28:46.473
And you agreed to that?

28:46.541 --> 28:48.576
I had to.

28:48.643 --> 28:50.878
Either Richard
was going to kill me,

28:50.946 --> 28:52.379
or I was gonna kill him.

28:54.149 --> 28:56.350
I needed Zedd.

29:00.088 --> 29:03.390
( ominous theme playing )

29:03.458 --> 29:05.593
No!

29:05.660 --> 29:07.728
( screams )
(Annabelle) Flynn!

29:07.796 --> 29:09.530
You promised!
You lied to me!

29:09.598 --> 29:10.931
I had to!

29:10.999 --> 29:13.634
If the Keeper wins,
everyone will die!

29:13.702 --> 29:16.203
I need the Seeker to fight him

29:16.271 --> 29:17.771
and seal the rift
in the Underworld.

29:17.839 --> 29:21.609
I need you to be you, Richard!

29:24.312 --> 29:27.047
- Annabelle!
- No! Don't kill her. I love her!

29:31.586 --> 29:33.454
I love her as much
as I ever loved you.

29:36.725 --> 29:39.226
I know you, Kahlan.

29:39.294 --> 29:42.263
You don't want to murder
the last Confessor.

29:44.399 --> 29:45.566
I never asked to be a Confessor.

29:45.634 --> 29:47.501
I never asked
to be locked in a tower.

29:49.504 --> 29:51.105
I just want to be
like everyone else.

29:52.741 --> 29:54.108
If there was any other way...

29:54.175 --> 29:55.276
Maybe there is.

29:56.945 --> 29:58.512
The sorcerer's quillion.

29:58.580 --> 30:03.017
If we can get it we can use it
to drain Annabelle's powers.

30:03.084 --> 30:04.985
Would Richard and Flynn
be released?

30:05.053 --> 30:06.720
I doubt it's ever been tried.

30:06.788 --> 30:09.323
But in theory,
they shouldn't be bound by magic

30:09.391 --> 30:12.226
she herself no longer possesses.

30:12.294 --> 30:13.961
Kahlan, if you love me you'll
give it a try.

30:14.029 --> 30:16.697
He's only saying that
because he's been confessed.

30:19.935 --> 30:22.937
Confessed or not,

30:23.004 --> 30:25.239
Richard would do anything
to save a life.

30:25.307 --> 30:27.741
We have to get the stone first.

30:27.809 --> 30:29.643
And then we'll go
to the sorcerer's cave

30:29.711 --> 30:32.613
and get his quillion.

30:32.681 --> 30:34.715
(Cara)
I don't believe what I'm hearing.

30:34.783 --> 30:38.252
You want us to risk everything...

30:38.320 --> 30:41.055
Our lives, Richard's life.
...to save her?

30:41.122 --> 30:44.024
If you don't have the stomach
to kill her, I will.

30:46.361 --> 30:48.796
I seem to remember Richard
going to great lengths

30:48.863 --> 30:50.698
to save your life.

30:55.670 --> 30:57.771
And if it doesn't release him?

30:57.839 --> 31:00.307
Then I'll do what needs
to be done.

31:06.081 --> 31:07.848
( suspenseful theme playing )

31:49.190 --> 31:51.291
It's another locket.

31:51.358 --> 31:53.727
Maybe there'
another rune inside it.

31:53.794 --> 31:57.230
Or maybe it holds
the Stone of Tears.

31:57.298 --> 31:58.898
The Seeker should be
the one to open it.

31:58.966 --> 32:00.967
(Zedd)
When he's released
from confession.

32:01.035 --> 32:03.369
Not when he's
this unpredictable.

32:03.437 --> 32:05.371
You got what you came for.

32:05.439 --> 32:06.639
We need to go after
the quillion.

32:08.776 --> 32:10.143
He can still fight.

32:10.211 --> 32:11.978
He'd do anything
to save her life.

32:12.046 --> 32:15.648
We both know Richard
can't be relied upon right now.

32:21.722 --> 32:23.356
Then Cara and I will
just have to take care

32:23.424 --> 32:24.724
of the sorcerer ourselves.

32:26.761 --> 32:28.928
( suspenseful theme playing )

32:36.203 --> 32:38.505
Are you sure?

32:38.572 --> 32:40.940
Any sorcerer as powerful as Lorcus

32:41.008 --> 32:42.809
is going to be able
to see right through us

32:42.877 --> 32:44.177
if we aren't convincing.

32:44.245 --> 32:45.378
If you insist.

32:48.349 --> 32:49.616
This will hurt.

32:49.683 --> 32:51.317
Just do it.

32:54.989 --> 32:56.256
( Agiel whining )

32:56.323 --> 32:57.824
( grunting )

32:57.892 --> 32:59.692
( dramatic theme playing )

33:05.340 --> 33:07.107
I have something the sorcerer

33:07.175 --> 33:09.376
would be very interested in.

33:12.714 --> 33:15.049
Surrender your weapon.

33:15.116 --> 33:17.284
Go ahead. Take it.

33:17.352 --> 33:18.552
(man)
I know the power of the Agiel.

33:18.620 --> 33:21.055
Lay it down yourself.

33:23.825 --> 33:25.059
And the other one.

33:30.298 --> 33:31.732
Now summon your sorcerer,

33:31.800 --> 33:34.668
or I take
my merchandise elsewhere.

33:34.736 --> 33:37.037
And what would
a Mord-Sith expect in return

33:37.105 --> 33:39.139
for her "merchandise?"

33:39.207 --> 33:42.042
A thousand gold pieces.

33:42.110 --> 33:44.712
Why would I pay such a price?

33:44.779 --> 33:48.015
Rumor has it you're in
the market for Confessor power.

33:48.083 --> 33:50.951
This is the Mother Confessor.

33:51.019 --> 33:53.420
I sincerely doubt you'd
be made a better offer.

33:53.488 --> 33:55.489
She's no use to me dead.

33:55.557 --> 33:57.124
(Cara)
She's not dead.

33:57.192 --> 34:00.694
Just compliant.

34:05.266 --> 34:07.234
How do I know that?

34:07.302 --> 34:08.969
Examine her yourself.

34:15.710 --> 34:17.811
( dramatic theme playing )

34:17.879 --> 34:18.911
( all grunting )

34:26.487 --> 34:27.554
Command me, Confessor.

34:30.190 --> 34:31.558
Call off your guards.

34:31.626 --> 34:33.360
Stop!

34:33.428 --> 34:34.594
Don't harm them.

34:36.364 --> 34:39.166
Give me the quillion.

34:39.234 --> 34:40.601
(Annabelle)
You spared my life

34:40.668 --> 34:44.038
even when your friends
told you not to.

34:44.105 --> 34:46.607
You can thank me if this works.

34:46.674 --> 34:49.076
If it does,
you'll be the last Confessor.

34:51.246 --> 34:53.280
You'll have to take a mate.

34:53.348 --> 34:55.616
Yes.

34:55.683 --> 34:57.083
Someday I will.

34:57.152 --> 34:58.952
Richard would make a good father

34:59.020 --> 35:01.021
for a Confessor, wouldn't he?

35:01.089 --> 35:02.289
Annabelle...

35:02.357 --> 35:04.258
If he's confessed to me,

35:04.325 --> 35:06.560
you can't hurt him.

35:06.628 --> 35:09.296
And he could give you a child.

35:09.364 --> 35:12.866
And then when you take my magic
he'll be released, won't he?

35:12.934 --> 35:16.637
Yes, but,
that isn't the way that...

35:16.704 --> 35:18.405
(Zedd)
Kahlan.

35:18.473 --> 35:23.110
Maybe you should consider
what she is suggesting.

35:23.178 --> 35:25.045
If something were
to happen to you,

35:25.113 --> 35:29.249
then the race of Confessors
would be no longer.

35:29.317 --> 35:32.786
I want to do something for you

35:32.854 --> 35:35.789
while I'm still a Confessor.

35:35.857 --> 35:37.324
Please.

35:41.629 --> 35:44.531
But I don't love her.
I love you.

35:44.599 --> 35:46.934
This will make me very happy.

35:47.001 --> 35:49.369
Go to her.

35:49.437 --> 35:52.039
And love her
as you would love me.

35:55.577 --> 35:57.444
( tense theme playing )

36:33.615 --> 36:35.883
( quietly ):
Kahlan.

36:35.950 --> 36:37.818
It's all right.

36:37.886 --> 36:40.420
It's all right.

37:00.475 --> 37:03.277
( dramatic theme playing )

37:06.992 --> 37:08.459
( moaning )

37:29.514 --> 37:31.949
Richard. Richard.

37:32.017 --> 37:33.117
What are you thinking about?

37:35.787 --> 37:37.121
Pleasing you.

37:40.292 --> 37:43.327
Because your mistress
ordered you to?

37:44.763 --> 37:46.364
Yes.

37:53.605 --> 37:55.906
You really love her, don't you?

37:58.110 --> 37:59.777
With all my heart.

38:05.317 --> 38:07.084
( groans )

38:11.990 --> 38:14.058
Did I do something wrong?

38:14.126 --> 38:15.760
No.

38:15.827 --> 38:16.994
You didn't do anything wrong.

38:18.497 --> 38:19.730
But my mistress
commanded me to...

38:19.798 --> 38:21.298
I know.

38:22.701 --> 38:25.503
( tense theme playing )

38:32.778 --> 38:35.546
(Annabelle)
I guess I wouldn't want to give
myself to Flynn like that

38:35.614 --> 38:37.748
if he was thinking
about somebody else.

38:39.384 --> 38:41.585
It isn't just that.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.387
Richard would never use magic

38:43.455 --> 38:45.790
to force someone
to act against their will.

38:45.857 --> 38:48.726
But it's not really
against his will.

38:48.794 --> 38:50.995
If he wasn't confessed,
he would want to.

38:51.062 --> 38:54.965
But he is confessed.

38:55.033 --> 38:58.469
And I'm not prepared
to make that decision for him.

38:58.537 --> 39:00.504
Or to make him a father
without his blessing.

39:00.572 --> 39:04.241
But for Confessors...

39:04.309 --> 39:06.444
Isn't it always like that?

39:06.511 --> 39:10.147
That's why we don't take men
we love as mates.

39:13.819 --> 39:17.388
It's kind of like being locked
in a tower, isn't it?

39:22.294 --> 39:24.161
We should get started.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.865
If this works,

39:27.933 --> 39:30.568
I can get married one day.

39:30.635 --> 39:32.169
I hope you will.

39:33.672 --> 39:36.373
But Flynn won't love me anymore.

39:36.441 --> 39:39.910
He's just the first one you met.
There will be other men.

39:39.978 --> 39:41.645
But what if he's the only one
that I'll ever love?

39:45.283 --> 39:47.084
( dramatic theme playing )

39:53.425 --> 39:54.658
Annabelle, are you all right?

39:54.726 --> 39:56.794
It didn't work.

39:56.862 --> 39:58.896
I'm not confessed anymore.

39:58.964 --> 40:00.364
I was just making sure
she was all right.

40:00.432 --> 40:01.832
Richard?

40:01.900 --> 40:04.235
( dramatic theme playing )

40:13.678 --> 40:15.279
( sighs )

40:21.586 --> 40:24.054
(Kahlan)
We'll see you safely home.

40:24.122 --> 40:27.324
Your father's castle
is rightfully yours now.

40:27.392 --> 40:28.826
Thank you, but, uh,

40:28.894 --> 40:30.394
I think I've spent enough
of my life there.

40:31.730 --> 40:33.163
I want to see the world.

40:33.231 --> 40:34.498
Where we're going won't be safe.

40:34.566 --> 40:35.966
I'll go myself.

40:36.034 --> 40:37.835
I've always wanted
to see the ocean.

40:37.903 --> 40:39.970
I don't think it's safe for you
to travel alone.

40:40.038 --> 40:42.940
I'll take her.

40:43.008 --> 40:46.577
I mean, um, I'm headed
toward Wynnmore anyway.

40:46.645 --> 40:48.746
I... I have
a cousin there.

40:48.813 --> 40:50.347
It's near the ocean.

40:51.983 --> 40:53.851
What?
You don't need me anymore.

40:53.919 --> 40:56.420
So you can come along,
if you want to.

40:59.591 --> 41:02.026
Well, I can't say
it's been fun,

41:03.328 --> 41:05.062
but it's been interesting.

41:06.398 --> 41:07.965
( laughing )

41:23.214 --> 41:25.482
It's only me now.

41:25.550 --> 41:27.151
No.

41:27.218 --> 41:28.786
You got us.

41:32.691 --> 41:34.391
Kahlan,

41:34.459 --> 41:36.694
I can understand why you
couldn't go through with it.

41:39.531 --> 41:41.398
But part of me wishes you had.

41:43.969 --> 41:45.069
Me too.

41:47.772 --> 41:50.441
And now that
we have our Seeker back...

41:51.810 --> 41:54.845
It's time to open this.

42:05.256 --> 42:07.558
Is it the Stone of Tears?

42:07.626 --> 42:09.526
No. I think it's a compass.

42:13.231 --> 42:17.401
"This orb will guide
the Seeker's way."

42:17.469 --> 42:19.169
(Cara)
To what?

42:21.439 --> 42:24.475
Hopefully the Stone of Tears.

42:24.542 --> 42:27.177
Let's not waste time, then.

42:27.245 --> 42:30.547
We head north.

42:30.615 --> 42:33.384
