00:04.070 --> 00:06.834
The Christmas tree seems
to inspire a love-hate relationship.

00:07.007 --> 00:10.204
All that time is spent
selecting it and decorating it...

00:10.377 --> 00:13.210
...and then a week after,
it's just thrown somewhere.

00:13.380 --> 00:16.406
You see it by the side of the road.
It looks like a mob hit.

00:16.583 --> 00:20.781
The car slows down, the door opens,
and this tree just rolls out.

00:22.522 --> 00:26.049
People snap out of that Christmas
spirit like it was a drunken stupor.

00:26.226 --> 00:28.023
They just wake up one morning
and go:

00:28.194 --> 00:31.254
"Oh, my God,
there's a tree inside the house.

00:31.698 --> 00:34.326
Just throw it anywhere."

00:40.907 --> 00:42.875
Ready to go, Lois?

00:43.109 --> 00:45.873
Boy, you sure like to say my name,
don't you?

00:46.046 --> 00:48.446
Excuse me, Lois.
Stand back, Lois.

00:48.615 --> 00:49.946
Jimmy's in trouble, Lois.

00:51.451 --> 00:53.817
Oh, Mr. Meyer,
this is my friend Jerry--

00:53.987 --> 00:58.219
-Jerry Seinfeld.
-Duncan Meyer.

00:58.391 --> 01:00.916
-You two know each other?
-Yeah.

01:01.094 --> 01:04.325
We went to high school together,
didn't we, Jerry?

01:04.497 --> 01:07.830
-Yeah, yeah.
-Gee, I hope you're not leaving now.

01:08.001 --> 01:10.265
We still have a lot of
work left to do.

01:10.437 --> 01:12.905
Would you be able to come
all the way downtown again...

01:13.073 --> 01:14.631
...in rush hour and pick me up?

01:15.108 --> 01:18.168
Why, I'd have to be Superman
to do that, Lois.

01:19.813 --> 01:22.008
No. No, this is all wrong.

01:22.182 --> 01:25.515
-Where's the chicken cashew?
-You no order chicken cashew.

01:26.252 --> 01:29.244
No, I didn't order any of this.
I'm not paying for this.

01:29.756 --> 01:30.984
Fine, Benes.

01:31.157 --> 01:32.647
We're putting you on our list.

01:33.026 --> 01:35.426
-What list?
-The do-not-deliver list.

01:36.429 --> 01:37.794
Merry Christmas to you.

01:40.700 --> 01:43.396
-Well, I guess we'll just go out.
-Yeah.

01:43.570 --> 01:45.629
What are you doing
with the <i>Daily Worker</i> ?

01:45.805 --> 01:47.796
I figure Ned must have left it here.

01:48.041 --> 01:51.442
Your boyfriend reads the <i>Daily
Worker</i> ? What is he, a Communist?

01:51.678 --> 01:54.169
He reads everything.
You know, Ned's very well-read.

01:54.447 --> 01:58.315
Maybe he's just very, well, Red.

02:01.321 --> 02:04.688
A Communist? Don't you think
he probably would have told me?

02:04.858 --> 02:08.122
Well, does he wear bland, drab,
olive-colored clothing?

02:08.661 --> 02:10.094
Yes.

02:10.263 --> 02:12.629
Yes, he does dress a little drab.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.664
He's a Communist.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.793
Hey, look at this.

02:18.004 --> 02:22.464
"Exciting, uninhibited woman
seeks forward-thinking comrade.

02:22.642 --> 02:25.133
Appearance not important."

02:25.311 --> 02:28.439
Appearance not important?
This is unbelievable.

02:28.615 --> 02:31.982
Finally, this an ideology
I can embrace.

02:32.619 --> 02:34.143
-Hey.
-Hey.

02:34.554 --> 02:36.215
-Where's Lois?
-She couldn't make it.

02:36.389 --> 02:38.914
I can't believe you're going out
with a woman named Lois.

02:39.092 --> 02:40.354
I know. Finally.

02:40.527 --> 02:42.620
But, George,
guess who her boss is?

02:42.795 --> 02:45.559
-Duncan Meyer.
-Duncan Meyer?

02:45.732 --> 02:47.165
-Who's he?
-Elaine...

02:47.333 --> 02:49.733
...only one person knows
what I'm about to tell you...

02:49.903 --> 02:51.461
...and that's George.

02:55.241 --> 02:59.007
In the ninth grade they had us all line
up in the schoolyard for this race...

02:59.179 --> 03:01.841
...to see who would represent
the school in this track meet.

03:02.115 --> 03:05.710
I was the last one on the end, George
was next to me and Mr. Bevilaqua--

03:05.885 --> 03:08.752
-What's that?
-Mr. Bevilaqua, the gym teacher.

03:08.922 --> 03:10.913
-Oh, of course.
-He was down at the other end.

03:11.090 --> 03:16.118
So he yells out, "Ready.
On your mark. Get set...."

03:16.296 --> 03:19.459
And I was so keyed up,
I just took off.

03:19.632 --> 03:22.100
By the time he said, "Go,"
I was ten yards ahead.

03:22.268 --> 03:23.496
-No.
-I looked up.

03:23.670 --> 03:25.035
I couldn't believe it.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.799
By the time the race was over,
I had won. I was shocked.

03:27.974 --> 03:30.340
-Nobody had noticed the head start.
-Really?

03:30.510 --> 03:32.239
Yes. And I had won by so much...

03:32.412 --> 03:35.575
...a myth began to grow
about my speed.

03:36.149 --> 03:38.276
Only Duncan suspected
something was amiss.

03:38.451 --> 03:40.578
He's hated me ever since.

03:40.753 --> 03:42.744
And now he's back.

03:43.489 --> 03:45.480
Well, what happened
when you raced him again?

03:45.658 --> 03:47.387
I never did.

03:48.328 --> 03:50.888
In four years of high school,
I would never race anyone...

03:51.064 --> 03:53.362
...not even to the end of a block
or to catch a bus.

03:53.666 --> 03:55.725
And so the legend grew.

03:55.902 --> 03:58.393
Everyone wanted me to race.
They begged me.

03:58.571 --> 04:02.166
The track coach called my parents,
pleading, telling them it was a sin...

04:02.342 --> 04:04.606
...for me to waste
my God-given talent.

04:04.777 --> 04:07.746
But I answered him in the same way
I answered everyone.

04:07.914 --> 04:10.246
I choose not to run.

04:12.752 --> 04:14.845
So now Duncan is back?

04:15.021 --> 04:16.988
He's back.

04:17.156 --> 04:19.750
As I knew he would be someday.

04:23.229 --> 04:25.697
Man, that's some tart cider.

04:29.669 --> 04:31.068
-Hi.
-Hi.

04:31.237 --> 04:34.263
-Sorry I missed the Chinese food.
-Oh, so am l.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.840
How's Duncan?

04:37.277 --> 04:39.074
He's okay.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.310
He say anything?

04:41.714 --> 04:42.942
About what?

04:43.716 --> 04:46.048
Oh, nothing in particular.

04:47.086 --> 04:49.611
-Why did you cheat in that race?
-I did not cheat.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.347
He said that you got a head start.

04:51.524 --> 04:54.357
Oh, he's just jealous
because he came in second.

04:54.527 --> 04:56.791
-Really?
-Yeah.

04:57.230 --> 04:59.494
So you were the fastest kid
in school.

05:00.400 --> 05:03.301
Faster than a speeding bullet, Lois.

05:05.772 --> 05:09.799
So how was work?
Another day, another dollar?

05:10.910 --> 05:13.174
-I guess.
-Yeah, well, nothing wrong with that.

05:13.346 --> 05:16.247
Gotta make those big bucks.

05:16.416 --> 05:19.112
Money, money, money.

05:19.819 --> 05:21.912
Are you a Communist?

05:24.290 --> 05:25.655
Yes, as a matter of fact, I am.

05:28.394 --> 05:29.986
A commie.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.764
Must be a bummer for you guys...

05:32.932 --> 05:35.730
...what with the fall of
the Soviet empire and everything.

05:36.035 --> 05:38.503
Well, yeah. Well,
we still got China, Cuba.

05:39.138 --> 05:42.130
Yeah, but come on.

05:43.509 --> 05:46.410
-I know. It's not the same.
-Well, you had a good run.

05:46.579 --> 05:50.015
I mean, what was it? Seventy-five,
80 years wreaking havoc...

05:50.183 --> 05:51.548
...making everybody nervous.

05:52.785 --> 05:54.412
Yeah, we had a good run.

05:54.587 --> 05:57.283
Well, so enjoy yourself.

06:00.760 --> 06:01.988
So you lied to her?

06:02.228 --> 06:05.823
I couldn't tell her the truth. I don't know
what's gonna happen between us.

06:06.032 --> 06:08.227
If we have a bad breakup,
she'll go to Duncan.

06:08.401 --> 06:12.565
I want him to go to his grave never
being certain that I got that head start.

06:13.272 --> 06:17.436
Well, I'm dating a Communist.

06:18.778 --> 06:21.804
-A Communist? That's something.
-Yeah, that's pretty cool, isn't it?

06:21.981 --> 06:23.710
Hey, I called one of those girls...

06:23.883 --> 06:26.613
...from the personal ads
in the <i>Daily Worker</i>.

06:26.886 --> 06:29.286
-The <i>Daily Worker</i> has personals?
-Yeah.

06:29.489 --> 06:33.050
And they say that appearance
is not important.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.217
Yours or hers?

06:37.830 --> 06:40.196
Merry Christmas, everyone.

06:40.366 --> 06:42.664
-Merry Christmas.
-Well, look at you.

06:42.835 --> 06:44.393
-You got the job.
-You're looking...

06:44.570 --> 06:47.767
...at the new Santa
at Coleman's Department Store.

06:47.940 --> 06:49.703
-All right. Way to go.
-Congratulations.

06:49.876 --> 06:52.106
Yeah. Feel that, isn't it great?

06:52.311 --> 06:54.575
Look, it's Mickey.

06:55.915 --> 06:58.042
Come on. Get your beard on.
We're gonna be late.

06:58.217 --> 07:01.482
On Prancer. On Dasher.
On Donna.

07:01.687 --> 07:03.518
It's not Donna. It's Donner.

07:03.689 --> 07:05.156
-It's Donna.
-Right. On Prancer.

07:05.324 --> 07:07.383
On Dancer. On Ethel. On Harriet.

07:11.297 --> 07:14.232
Hello. Oh, hi, Lois.

07:14.467 --> 07:17.368
He wants to get together?
What for?

07:17.570 --> 07:20.539
I don't know about that.
I'll have to think about it.

07:20.706 --> 07:23.937
-I'll let you know. Okay. Bye.
-What's up?

07:24.110 --> 07:26.101
Duncan wants to get together
with me and her.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.440
He's gonna try to get me
to admit I got a head start.

07:28.614 --> 07:30.206
I don't think she believes me.

07:30.383 --> 07:31.975
He wants to meet you?

07:32.151 --> 07:35.552
I'll tell you what. I'll show up.
He doesn't know we're friends.

07:35.721 --> 07:38.781
I'll pretend I haven't seen you
since school. I'll back up the story.

07:38.958 --> 07:40.755
-That's not bad.
-Not bad?

07:40.927 --> 07:42.622
It's gorgeous.

07:49.001 --> 07:52.164
Well, come on, little princess,
tell Santa what you want.

07:52.338 --> 07:55.671
-Don't be shy.
-She doesn't speak English.

07:55.875 --> 07:58.673
Oh, Santa speaks the language
of all children.

08:08.654 --> 08:11.384
Hey, Mickey, when do we get a break?
My lap is killing me.

08:11.557 --> 08:14.321
-There is no break.
-This is like a sweatshop.

08:15.528 --> 08:17.860
-Kramer.
-Hey, hey, hey.

08:23.135 --> 08:24.830
There's a Natalie on line two.

08:25.171 --> 08:28.766
-Natalie?
-From the <i>Daily Worker</i>.

08:29.141 --> 08:30.836
Thank you.

08:33.412 --> 08:35.880
Hello. Yes, Natalie.

08:36.249 --> 08:42.017
Well, yes, this is a business office,
but I'm not a businessman per se.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.656
I'm here working for the people.

08:45.324 --> 08:48.020
Yes, I'm causing dissent...

08:48.194 --> 08:52.392
...stirring the pot, getting people
to question the whole rotten system.

08:55.935 --> 08:57.527
-Elaine.
-Arlene.

08:57.703 --> 08:59.034
-Hi.
-Hello.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.867
-Doing a little Christmas shopping?
-Yeah, yeah.

09:02.041 --> 09:04.305
Oh, this is Ned.
He's a Communist.

09:04.610 --> 09:05.838
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

09:06.045 --> 09:08.741
Big Communist.
Big, big Communist.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.850
-It was awfully nice to see you.
-Yeah, see you later.

09:12.018 --> 09:13.952
-Okey-dokey. Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

09:14.120 --> 09:15.610
Listen, as long as we're here...

09:15.788 --> 09:18.382
...what do you say we do
a little shirt-shopping?

09:18.624 --> 09:20.717
Out of the question.

09:21.694 --> 09:23.093
-Kramer.
-Oh, hi.

09:23.262 --> 09:25.389
Hi. Hi, Mickey. How are you?

09:25.565 --> 09:27.430
-This is Ned.
-Oh, hey.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.067
How are you doing there, buddy?

09:29.235 --> 09:32.295
Hey, you guys stay here, okay?
I'll be right back. Right back.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.473
Eight hours of jingle-belling
and ho-ho-hoing.

09:35.641 --> 09:37.404
Boy, I am hoed out.

09:37.977 --> 09:40.377
-Anyone who works here is a sap.
-Hey, watch it, pal.

09:40.546 --> 09:42.377
Whoa, whoa, easy.
Come on, come on.

09:42.548 --> 09:44.709
What's the matter with you?

09:45.318 --> 09:48.082
The Santas at Bloomfields are making
double what you are.

09:48.754 --> 09:51.314
-Double?
-I bet the glue from that beard itches.

09:51.490 --> 09:52.718
You've got that straight.

09:52.925 --> 09:55.052
So when you get a rash
all over your face...

09:55.227 --> 09:57.752
...you think Coleman's will be there
with a medical plan?

09:57.930 --> 10:00.262
Look, you take that commie crap
out to the street.

10:00.433 --> 10:04.164
I've got literature in my car that will
change your whole way of thinking.

10:04.337 --> 10:05.998
-Talk to me.
-Don't listen to him.

10:06.172 --> 10:07.639
You've got a good job here.

10:08.507 --> 10:12.466
There's just no way you could've
beaten me by that much.

10:12.712 --> 10:15.340
I had already beaten you
in junior high school three times.

10:15.514 --> 10:17.744
I didn't hit puberty
till the ninth grade.

10:18.050 --> 10:20.985
That's what gave me my speed.

10:21.454 --> 10:24.617
Besides, if I got a head start, why
didn't Mr. Bevilaqua stop the race?

10:24.790 --> 10:28.282
-That's what I've always wondered.
-Well....

10:31.597 --> 10:34.065
Oh, my God.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.903
No. Oh, my God.

10:38.170 --> 10:40.001
Jerry.

10:40.840 --> 10:42.808
I'm sorry.

10:44.477 --> 10:45.774
George.

10:45.945 --> 10:51.247
-George Costanza.
-Oh, George Costanza.

10:51.417 --> 10:54.784
-Kennedy High.
-Yes, yes, yes.

10:54.954 --> 10:57.923
-This is unbelievable.
-Hi, George.

10:58.891 --> 11:02.224
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Don't tell me. Don't tell me.

11:02.395 --> 11:06.832
It starts with a.... Duncan.

11:06.999 --> 11:08.591
That's right.

11:08.768 --> 11:11.828
Wow, this is something. I haven't
seen you guys in, what, 20 years?

11:12.138 --> 11:14.197
-This is Lois.
-Hi, there.

11:16.308 --> 11:18.003
What have you been doing
with yourself?

11:18.177 --> 11:20.702
Well, I'm a comedian.

11:23.049 --> 11:26.314
Well, I really wouldn't know about that.
I don't watch much TV.

11:26.485 --> 11:29.283
I like to read.

11:29.755 --> 11:32.223
What do you do? A lot of that
did-you-ever-notice stuff?

11:32.391 --> 11:34.916
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

11:37.396 --> 11:39.523
It strikes me a lot of guys
are doing that kind.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.530
Yeah, yeah.

11:42.635 --> 11:44.728
Well, you really went bald there,
didn't you?

11:48.174 --> 11:50.802
-Yeah, yeah.
-You used to really have...

11:50.976 --> 11:55.777
-...a thick, full head of hair.
-Yeah, yeah.

11:55.948 --> 11:57.643
Poof.

11:57.817 --> 12:01.480
Yeah, well, I guess I started losing it
when I was about 28...

12:01.654 --> 12:03.781
...right around the time
I made my first million.

12:03.956 --> 12:06.550
Yeah. You know,
it's true what they say.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.854
-The first million is the hardest one.
-Yeah, yeah.

12:10.029 --> 12:12.589
-What do you do?
-I'm an architect.

12:13.966 --> 12:16.434
Have you designed
any buildings in New York?

12:16.602 --> 12:18.900
Have you seen the new addition
to the Guggenheim?

12:19.538 --> 12:21.733
-You did that?
-Yep, yep.

12:21.907 --> 12:24.034
Really didn't take very long either.

12:24.376 --> 12:27.971
Well, you've really built yourself up
into something.

12:29.248 --> 12:31.216
I had a dream, Jerry.

12:31.383 --> 12:34.045
You know,
one can't help but wonder...

12:34.220 --> 12:37.383
...what brings you into a crummy
little coffee shop like this.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.991
Well, I like to stay in touch
with the people.

12:41.727 --> 12:44.696
You got a hole in your sneaker there.
What is that, canvas?

12:44.864 --> 12:46.229
Yeah, my driver is waiting...

12:46.398 --> 12:49.299
...so I really should get running.
Good to see you guys again.

12:49.468 --> 12:51.436
George, George,
hang on a second...

12:51.604 --> 12:53.936
...because we haven't
seen you in so long.

12:54.740 --> 12:56.037
I thought we might reminisce.

12:56.208 --> 12:58.972
Duncan and I were just talking
about the day of the big race.

12:59.145 --> 13:01.875
Oh, the big race. Yes, yes.

13:02.214 --> 13:05.581
-You were there?
-Oh, sure, sure. I certainly was.

13:05.751 --> 13:08.345
Yeah, I remember that day.
Well, I'll never forget it...

13:08.521 --> 13:11.786
...because that was the day that
I lost my virginity to Miss Stafford...

13:11.957 --> 13:16.053
-...the voluptuous homeroom teacher.
-Miss Stafford?

13:16.228 --> 13:19.026
Yes, yes. You know,
I was in detention...

13:19.198 --> 13:21.792
...and she came up behind me
while I was erasing the board.

13:21.967 --> 13:25.562
-George.
-But I digress.

13:26.338 --> 13:29.171
Let me see. I remember you were
standing at one end of the line.

13:29.341 --> 13:31.400
I was right next to you...

13:31.577 --> 13:34.205
...and I remember we were even
for the first five yards...

13:34.380 --> 13:36.075
...and then.... You were gone.

13:36.248 --> 13:38.808
-Did I get a head start?
-Head start? Oh, no.

13:38.984 --> 13:40.508
Absolutely not. No.

13:41.287 --> 13:42.652
You satisfied? So you see?

13:42.822 --> 13:45.655
No. I'm still not convinced,
and I never will be.

13:45.925 --> 13:48.155
Why don't the two of you
just race again?

13:48.327 --> 13:50.852
-That's a good idea.
-No, no, no.

13:51.030 --> 13:52.657
Another race. Out of the question.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.858
You've been saying that for 20 years.
You know you can't beat me.

13:56.035 --> 13:59.937
You couldn't beat me then,
and you can't beat me now.

14:01.273 --> 14:04.140
Race him, Jerry. Race him.

14:05.911 --> 14:07.640
All right.

14:08.180 --> 14:09.408
I'll do it.

14:09.582 --> 14:11.140
The race is on.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.445
-You're gonna race him?
-Yeah.

14:15.621 --> 14:19.079
And he's calling all these people
from high school to come and watch.

14:20.759 --> 14:22.920
I knew this day would come.

14:23.262 --> 14:27.562
I can't. I can't go through with it. I'm
calling it off. I can't let the legend die.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.893
It's like a kid finding out
there's no Santa Claus.

14:31.403 --> 14:35.533
Each according to his ability,
to each according to his means.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.107
What does that mean?

14:37.276 --> 14:40.734
Well, if you got means and ability,
that's a pretty good combination.

14:40.913 --> 14:43.006
So what if I wanna
open a delicatessen?

14:43.182 --> 14:45.173
There are no delicatessens
under Communists.

14:45.351 --> 14:46.818
Whoa, why not?

14:47.019 --> 14:49.749
Well, because the meats
are divided into a class system.

14:49.922 --> 14:51.913
You've got pastrami
and corned beef in one...

14:52.091 --> 14:54.389
...and salami and bologna in another.
Not right.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.221
So you can't get corned beef?

14:56.395 --> 15:00.832
Well, you know,
if you're in the politburo, maybe.

15:02.468 --> 15:05.335
Yeah, this is George Costanza.
Any messages for me?

15:06.071 --> 15:08.972
Why does Mr. Steinbrenner
wanna see me in his office?

15:10.042 --> 15:12.670
Communist? I'm not a Communist.

15:14.046 --> 15:15.946
All right. All right. I'll be there.

15:17.216 --> 15:19.741
My secretary told Mr. Steinbrenner
I'm a Communist.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.147
Now he wants to see me.

15:21.320 --> 15:23.788
You'll just explain to him
that you're not a Communist.

15:23.956 --> 15:26.288
You just called the woman
for a date.

15:28.627 --> 15:30.117
Hello.

15:30.863 --> 15:34.355
Oh, hi, Duncan.
No. Four o'clock tomorrow...

15:34.533 --> 15:36.160
...that is not going to work.

15:36.335 --> 15:39.133
Why? I'll tell you why.

15:39.305 --> 15:42.172
Because I choose not to run.

15:43.409 --> 15:45.434
I'm sorry, Elaine.
This shirt's too fancy.

15:45.611 --> 15:49.206
Just because you're a Communist,
you can't wear anything nice?

15:49.381 --> 15:52.009
-You look like Trotsky.
-Good.

15:53.085 --> 15:55.849
Fine. You wanna be a Communist?
Be a Communist.

15:56.021 --> 15:58.353
Can't you at least look like
a successful Communist?

15:58.524 --> 16:00.719
All right. I'll try it on.

16:00.893 --> 16:04.192
-I'm gonna order Chinese food.
-You're ordering from Hop Sing's?

16:04.964 --> 16:07.831
Does it have to be Hop Sing's?
I kind of had a fight with them.

16:08.334 --> 16:11.098
Elaine, when my father
was blacklisted...

16:11.270 --> 16:12.862
...he couldn't work for years.

16:13.038 --> 16:15.666
He and his friends used to sit
in Hop Sing's every day...

16:15.841 --> 16:17.502
...figuring out how to survive.

16:17.876 --> 16:20.970
-Your father was blacklisted?
-Yes, he was. And you know why?

16:21.213 --> 16:23.579
Because he was betrayed
by people he trusted.

16:23.749 --> 16:27.378
-They named names.
-Okay. Okay.

16:32.958 --> 16:35.051
Yeah, hi. I'd like a delivery, please...

16:35.227 --> 16:39.823
...to 16 West 75th Street.
Apartment 2G.

16:40.032 --> 16:41.556
I know that address.

16:41.734 --> 16:43.497
You're Benes, right?

16:43.669 --> 16:44.966
You're on our list.

16:45.137 --> 16:46.900
No more deliveries!

16:47.973 --> 16:50.703
No, no.
She doesn't live here anymore.

16:50.876 --> 16:52.343
This is someone else.

16:52.511 --> 16:54.274
Oh, yeah? What's the name?

16:54.680 --> 16:57.205
Why do you need a name?
You already have the address.

16:57.383 --> 16:59.578
We need a name.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.151
Give us a name.

17:02.354 --> 17:03.981
Okay, okay.

17:04.156 --> 17:06.646
Ned lsaacoff.

17:09.361 --> 17:11.352
I want a racing car set.

17:11.930 --> 17:14.694
A racing car set?

17:14.867 --> 17:16.300
Listen. You don't want that.

17:16.468 --> 17:20.097
Those are assembled in Taiwan
by kids like you.

17:20.939 --> 17:23.703
And these Coleman pigs,
they sell it for triple the cost.

17:23.942 --> 17:26.502
-But I want a racing car set.
-No. Don't you see, kid?

17:26.678 --> 17:28.373
You're being bamboozled.

17:28.580 --> 17:30.741
These capitalist fat cats...

17:30.916 --> 17:34.784
...are inflating the profit margin and
reducing your total number of toys.

17:34.953 --> 17:38.013
-Hey, this guy is a commie!
-Hey, kid, quiet.

17:39.558 --> 17:42.891
Where did a nice little boy like you
learn such a bad word like that?

17:43.228 --> 17:45.924
Commie, commie,
traitor to our country.

17:47.666 --> 17:50.533
Santa is not a commie.

17:50.702 --> 17:53.535
He just forgot how his good friend
stuck his neck out for him...

17:53.705 --> 17:57.004
...to get him a good job like this,
didn't he, Santa?

17:57.176 --> 17:59.701
Is there a problem here?

17:59.878 --> 18:02.972
This guy's a commie,
and he's spreading propaganda.

18:03.148 --> 18:04.445
Oh, yeah?

18:04.616 --> 18:07.744
Well, that's enough, pinko.
You're through. The both of you.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.083
-I got two kids in college.
-Oh, you can't fire me. I'm Santa.

18:11.256 --> 18:14.123
Not anymore.
Get your skinny ass out of here!

18:16.528 --> 18:18.689
Hi, how are you?

18:19.231 --> 18:20.789
Fine.

18:21.033 --> 18:22.796
What's the matter?

18:23.001 --> 18:24.764
I just spoke to Duncan.

18:24.937 --> 18:28.100
He said if you don't race,
he's going to fire me.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.199
What? He can't do that.

18:30.642 --> 18:32.269
Yes, he can.

18:32.444 --> 18:35.743
He controls
the means of production.

18:36.081 --> 18:38.106
What are you gonna do, Jerry?

18:38.484 --> 18:40.145
Don't worry, Lois.

18:40.319 --> 18:42.048
I'll think of something.

18:46.592 --> 18:50.323
I knew it was you.
You tried to trick Hop Sing.

18:50.496 --> 18:52.794
You're on our list. Elaine Benes.

18:53.265 --> 18:58.293
And now you're on our list.
Ned lsaacoff.

18:58.871 --> 19:01.601
You got me blacklisted
at Hop Sing's?

19:02.541 --> 19:05.169
She named name.

19:13.018 --> 19:15.145
You wanted to see me,
Mr. Steinbrenner?

19:15.320 --> 19:17.345
Yes, George, I did.
Come in, come in.

19:17.523 --> 19:21.391
George, the word around the office
is that you're a Communist.

19:22.661 --> 19:24.253
A Communist?

19:24.930 --> 19:27.865
I am a Yankee, sir,
first and foremost.

19:28.033 --> 19:31.867
A Communist pipeline into the vast
reservoir of Cuban baseball talent...

19:32.037 --> 19:35.006
...could be the greatest thing ever
to happen to this organization.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.698
-Sir?
-You could be invaluable...

19:36.875 --> 19:40.641
...to this franchise. There's a southpaw
nobody's been able to get a look at.

19:40.812 --> 19:43.042
Something-Rodriguez.
I don't really know his name.

19:43.215 --> 19:44.739
Get yourself to Havana right away.

19:45.117 --> 19:47.210
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

19:47.386 --> 19:49.684
-Do my best.
-Good. Merry Christmas, George.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.914
Bring me back some cigars
in the cedar boxes.

19:52.090 --> 19:54.217
The ones with the fancy rings.
Love those rings.

19:54.393 --> 19:55.860
They distract you
while you're smoking.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.826
The red and yellow are nice. Looks
good against the brown of the cigar.

19:58.997 --> 20:02.091
I like the maduro wrapper. The darker,
the better. That's what I say.

20:02.267 --> 20:04.462
The claro's good too.
That's more of a pale brown.

20:04.636 --> 20:06.001
Almost like a milky coffee.

20:06.171 --> 20:07.866
I find the ring size very confusing.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.474
They have it in centimeters,
which I don't understand.

20:11.276 --> 20:14.074
-That was great. Nice job, Santa.
-Yeah.

20:14.246 --> 20:16.237
I knew that stuff was
gonna get us in trouble.

20:16.415 --> 20:18.975
Well, I didn't realize it was
such a sensitive issue.

20:19.151 --> 20:22.416
Communism. You didn't realize
Communism was a sensitive issue?

20:22.588 --> 20:25.648
What do you think's been going on
in the world for the past 50 years?

20:25.824 --> 20:28.884
-Wake up and smell the coffee.
-I guess I screwed up!

20:29.061 --> 20:32.030
Oh, you sure did. Big time.

20:41.873 --> 20:43.272
How do you feel?

20:43.442 --> 20:45.342
I need a miracle.

20:46.845 --> 20:49.780
Now you're gonna see what kind
of a liar you're mixed up with.

20:49.948 --> 20:52.178
Well, if he beats you,
I want a big raise.

20:52.351 --> 20:55.286
If he beats me,
I'll not only give you a raise...

20:55.454 --> 20:58.116
...I'll send you to Hawaii
for two weeks.

20:58.290 --> 21:02.659
I parked in front. As soon as this race
is over, we gotta go to the airport.

21:02.828 --> 21:04.318
Yeah. I'll be there.

21:04.830 --> 21:06.058
You ready, boys?

21:06.265 --> 21:08.927
-Yeah, Mr. Bevilaqua.
-This is the way it's gonna work.

21:09.101 --> 21:13.470
You take your marks. I say,
"Ready, on your mark, get set"...

21:13.639 --> 21:15.266
...and then fire. You got it?

21:15.440 --> 21:17.465
-Yes, Mr. Bevilaqua.
-Yes, Mr. Bevilaqua.

21:17.643 --> 21:20.373
-Come on, Jerry.
-Come on, Jerry.

21:22.948 --> 21:24.609
Ready.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.275
On your mark.

21:38.997 --> 21:40.692
<i>Jerry.</i>

22:35.487 --> 22:37.717
So will you come to Hawaii
with me, Jerry?

22:37.889 --> 22:39.220
Maybe I will, Lois.

22:39.391 --> 22:41.757
Maybe I will.

22:55.574 --> 22:57.405
You wanted to see me,
<i>el presidente</i> ?

22:58.977 --> 23:03.676
Come here. I understand you are
very interested in one of our players.

23:06.351 --> 23:09.684
Ordinarily, I would not
grant such a request.

23:09.855 --> 23:14.121
But I have heard you are,
how you say, <i>communista simpatico</i>.

23:16.995 --> 23:20.294
Well, good.
Then you can have your pick.

23:20.465 --> 23:22.490
They will play for your Yankees.

23:26.638 --> 23:28.833
And I would be honored
if you would be my guest...

23:29.007 --> 23:31.407
...for dinner tonight
at the Presidential Palace.

23:31.576 --> 23:34.409
There will be girls there.
And I hear some pretty good food.

23:34.579 --> 23:36.410
Of course,
the problem with parties is...

23:36.581 --> 23:39.550
...you invariably have to eat
standing up, which I don't care for.

23:39.718 --> 23:42.915
But on the other hand, I don't like
to balance a plate on my lap either.

23:43.088 --> 23:46.114
Once when I was at a party,
I put my plate on someone's piano.

23:46.291 --> 23:48.088
If I had not been a dictator...

23:48.260 --> 23:50.990
...I would not have been able to
get away with that one.
