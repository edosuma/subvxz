Budhan, the laundry boy would have come...
and cut the fruits and keep

04:08.375 --> 04:09.717
All I am saying dad...

04:09.917 --> 04:11.800
...just go and sit on the pot...

04:12.000 --> 04:12.842
...it'll happen...

04:13.042 --> 04:15.092
But I am still not
feeling the pressure...

04:15.292 --> 04:16.091
Count these...

04:16.291 --> 04:17.267
Hey Budhan!

04:17.500 --> 04:18.800
Why didn't you give me black currant
with my milk last night?

04:19.000 --> 04:19.591
Of course I gave...

04:19.791 --> 04:22.342
This walking around won't help you...

04:22.542 --> 04:25.342
...just go and sit on the pot...

04:25.542 --> 04:27.300

You just don't want
to listen to anyone...

04:42.500 --> 04:45.550
...breakfast is here...eat
it...after you're 'done'.

04:45.750 --> 04:49.342
Look...I know that 'potty' feeling...

04:49.542 --> 04:52.342

Look..I can't stand like a beggar
in front of the client...

06:01.167 --> 06:02.217

06:02.417 --> 06:05.851
...if you've issues with that then I
am happy to not attend this meeting..

06:08.917 --> 06:11.395
You are meeting Aniket for lunch..

Come on yaar..not him..

06:15.167 --> 06:15.972
...he's a jerk!

06:17.375 --> 06:18.342

06:18.542 --> 06:20.895
I am...so...?

06:21.417 --> 06:22.643
Shall we?

06:23.042 --> 06:24.268
Syed...Kept it inside

06:24.667 --> 06:27.092
See I get your point...but my driver
was just trying to save the other car...

06:27.292 --> 06:28.342
...so he turned left...

06:28.542 --> 06:31.467
...you were coming from behind-..
in speed...naturally...it banged...

06:31.667 --> 06:33.217
Your driver was speeding!

06:33.417 --> 06:37.842
He hit and ran away...so
how's this natural?

06:38.042 --> 06:39.092
Sir, Piku madamji had said...

06:39.292 --> 06:42.300
stay quiet...
what else could this poor man have done?

06:42.500 --> 06:45.638
Who would cause an
accident intentionally?

06:46.042 --> 06:47.217
Now where did this dent come from?
...this one here...

06:47.417 --> 06:49.092
That was another lady driver
but that's not the point...

06:49.292 --> 06:51.092
Oh really?
Why do accidents happen with you only?

06:51.292 --> 06:53.425
Look don't deviate...

06:53.625 --> 06:55.050
Why is it always that
the guy in front is at fault?

06:55.250 --> 06:56.425
All I know that he has broken this...

06:56.625 --> 07:01.342
Oh hello..settle it or it's
a sure case of 'Hit and run'...

07:01.542 --> 07:02.894
Exactly.

07:04.417 --> 07:07.467
You can't be so safe with the
designs otherwise there is no point

07:07.667 --> 07:09.092
Ya
- Sorry..sir..

07:09.292 --> 07:12.050
...Ma'am..your father..

07:12.250 --> 07:13.675
What happened?

07:13.875 --> 07:15.592
There's a message...from him

07:15.792 --> 07:17.098
read it...

07:18.875 --> 07:20.636
Read it quickly

07:23.375 --> 07:25.342
"..day before I
had Semi liquid motion...

07:25.542 --> 07:27.770
...since then constipation and gas...

07:28.292 --> 07:29.769
What should I do?"

07:41.167 --> 07:42.644
Will you say something...?

07:44.250 --> 07:45.511

07:45.792 --> 07:48.270

07:54.542 --> 07:56.175
"Semi liquid motion first.

07:56.375 --> 07:58.342
Then 2 days of gas and constipation.

07:58.542 --> 07:59.894
What should I do?"

08:00.125 --> 08:01.967
What kind of a message is this
to leave at an office...?

08:02.167 --> 08:02.972
Why?

08:03.625 --> 08:06.175
I think..its a..
serious health issue..

08:06.375 --> 08:09.592
...and we should discuss it..

08:09.792 --> 08:12.092
We could've discussed at home...?
We live in the same house..

08:12.292 --> 08:14.092
But you said you didn't
want to talk to me...

08:14.292 --> 08:17.092
Fine...you could've sent me a text...?

08:17.292 --> 08:18.342
Why did you give it
to the Receptionist...?

08:18.542 --> 08:20.925
But just this morning you said
you didn't want to talk to me ...!

08:21.125 --> 08:22.300
Didn't you say that?

08:22.500 --> 08:23.800
This morning dad...

08:24.000 --> 08:27.300
I've kept the lunch on the
table..and I've have made Grand Pa's dish

08:27.500 --> 08:29.717

08:29.917 --> 08:31.050
Just go and keep lunch on the table...

08:31.250 --> 08:31.925

08:32.125 --> 08:33.217
What else did I say?

08:33.417 --> 08:34.424
So I said the same...table...

08:34.625 --> 08:35.467
Dad, in the middle of my...

08:35.667 --> 08:37.549

08:45.542 --> 08:47.019

09:02.125 --> 09:03.342
I don't want to die of constipation...!

09:03.542 --> 09:05.394
No one dies of constipation..

09:06.167 --> 09:07.393
Elvis Presley did..

09:08.792 --> 09:10.724
Don't look at me like that...

09:11.125 --> 09:12.425
...his body was found
in the bathroom...obviously...

09:12.625 --> 09:14.386
...he must've been
sitting on the commode...

09:16.417 --> 09:18.428
didn't you keep the
yogurt in the fridge?

09:20.125 --> 09:22.092
Look Piku none of
my problems are small..

09:22.292 --> 09:23.592
When you'll be my
age...you'll understand..

09:23.792 --> 09:25.425
I don't want to get to your age...

09:25.625 --> 09:28.638
you have problems
everywhere in your body".

09:29.292 --> 09:30.348
Imaginary..

09:30.792 --> 09:31.643
Imaginary?

09:31.875 --> 09:33.386
Then..see this..

09:33.625 --> 09:34.351

Diabetes negative..kidney
function normal..ECG normal..

09:44.167 --> 09:45.223
Budhan...!

09:45.792 --> 09:47.342
When did these reports come?
And why did you give it to her?

09:47.542 --> 09:49.217
That's not the point Dad.

09:49.417 --> 09:51.467
Srivastav uncle asked
for blood Count ONLY..

09:51.667 --> 09:54.429
...then why did you
get these extra tests done?

09:56.042 --> 09:59.592
Look at your face...everything
is normal but you are not happy...

09:59.792 --> 10:01.217
really...things will be better
off if something comes out...

10:01.417 --> 10:03.467
kidney..or lung or
diabetes or something...

10:03.667 --> 10:06.050
at least then..there will
a solution to this house..

10:06.250 --> 10:08.175
Look..I've given you full freedom.

10:08.375 --> 10:09.217
Don't talk to me like that..

10:09.417 --> 10:10.967
What freedom?

10:11.167 --> 10:13.967
I had to meet Aniket today

10:14.167 --> 10:16.092
Is this how I am going to
lead my life? discussing your shit?!

10:16.292 --> 10:18.770

And this your relationship status..

10:24.167 --> 10:24.925

I think...casual is fine...

10:28.292 --> 10:29.425
...that works for me...

10:29.625 --> 10:33.093

imagining..hypochondriac..

10:41.167 --> 10:42.393

10:48.250 --> 10:49.092
Why are you so late today?

10:49.292 --> 10:51.175
I've fired her...she
wont work for us anymore...

10:51.375 --> 10:54.800
I've left this job myself...give
me my dues and I'll leave...

10:55.000 --> 10:56.300
There is nothing due...

10:56.500 --> 10:58.011
dad please..

10:58.375 --> 10:59.925
Did he say something...

11:00.125 --> 11:01.842
"when I mop the floor,

11:02.042 --> 11:04.300
he walks behind me
with his dirty shoes,

11:04.500 --> 11:06.967
checking the room as
if I'll steal something...

11:07.167 --> 11:08.842
So so?
What is so wrong in that...?

11:09.042 --> 11:12.675
Three times a day I clean the
toilet and he's still not satisfied...

11:12.875 --> 11:16.342
and today he crossed the limits...he
said I've stolen the toilet cleaner.

11:16.542 --> 11:18.092
You think I'll do that?

11:18.292 --> 11:19.800
Then where did it go?

11:20.000 --> 11:21.467
One minute...dad

11:21.667 --> 11:23.342

11:23.542 --> 11:24.342
Look he didn't mean that...

11:24.542 --> 11:28.425
No he's suspecting me all the
time...just pay my dues and I'll leave

11:28.625 --> 11:30.675
I told you there's
no balance..fine Piku...

11:30.875 --> 11:33.967
...inside that drawer I've
kept eight hundred and fifty rupees.

11:34.167 --> 11:35.592

days...I've deducted that...

11:35.792 --> 11:36.717

12:32.792 --> 12:34.592
At least there won't be
any thief in this house...

12:34.792 --> 12:36.425
She was the main cause of his BP..

12:36.625 --> 12:37.851
You keep quiet..

12:38.542 --> 12:41.050
Why are you worried...she'll come

12:41.250 --> 12:42.967

13:46.042 --> 13:47.092
98.4 ..

13:47.292 --> 13:48.177
Hmm..

13:50.042 --> 13:53.134
After that?
- ..98.8..

13:53.667 --> 13:56.475
See it's increasing...

13:56.792 --> 13:57.893
...fever?..

13:59.542 --> 14:01.895
98.8..that's normal..

14:02.875 --> 14:04.136
Ok..I'll call him

14:05.875 --> 14:06.842
Everything ok?

14:07.042 --> 14:08.217
Yeah..sorry...just one sec..

14:08.417 --> 14:09.518
Ya ya go ahead..

14:09.792 --> 14:16.842
Dad ate Bryonia twice..he said
potty was hard along with 'mucus'..

14:17.042 --> 14:24.515
...no no later he said it looked
like mango pulp..yes and 98.8 fever..

14:24.917 --> 14:27.217
...hmm..ok thank you...

14:27.417 --> 14:29.019
Ohh...

14:30.042 --> 14:31.592
...should we order dinner..

14:31.792 --> 14:36.217
Uhh..no actually
I'm not so hungry now".

14:36.417 --> 14:37.268
Why...?

14:38.000 --> 14:41.388
No..just why don't
you..why don't you go ahead

14:44.792 --> 14:46.342
I'll just drop Piku
and come back home..

14:46.542 --> 14:49.020
...yeah...ok bye...bye...bye

14:51.042 --> 14:53.217
...he hasn't seen any
of Satyajit Ray's films..

14:53.417 --> 14:54.592
And he doesn't vote!

14:54.792 --> 14:56.599
I was somehow tolerating him..

14:57.625 --> 14:58.342
You were right...

14:58.542 --> 14:59.768
He's such a jerk!

15:00.250 --> 15:01.425
Did dad call you up?

15:01.625 --> 15:02.760
Yes

15:03.625 --> 15:04.601
Hun..

15:07.042 --> 15:08.467
Why did you react like this...?

15:08.667 --> 15:09.768
Like what?

15:10.875 --> 15:13.728
I said Dad called, so you said "hun"

15:14.417 --> 15:18.092
Right...I asked if Dad called you
and you said "Yes" so I said "hun"?

15:18.292 --> 15:19.967
So what's wrong?
- Who reacts like that, What is “hun"

15:20.167 --> 15:22.175
Dad called me...so
you should say "ok"...

15:22.375 --> 15:23.092
...what is "Hun"

15:23.292 --> 15:24.467
I know but you said you
said "yes" ...so I said "hun"

15:24.667 --> 15:26.425
NO you didn't say, you said "hun"

15:26.625 --> 15:27.977
Come on Piku...

15:28.542 --> 15:30.519
...I just said "hun"
so what's wrong in it

15:34.792 --> 15:38.092
Piku mentioned yellow..pulp..

15:38.292 --> 15:39.842
Right but then later..

15:40.042 --> 15:44.050
It was greenish..not black,
but greenish...yellowish green..

15:44.250 --> 15:46.217
Why don't you both
sit with a shade card?

15:46.417 --> 15:49.475
What percent of green..how
much percent of yellow...

15:49.917 --> 15:50.592
shit is shit...

15:50.792 --> 15:52.467
...mind your business...!
- But Grand Pa..

15:52.667 --> 15:53.675
My heart says..

15:53.875 --> 15:56.717
One day you'll have a great motion...
just the way you desire...lots...

15:56.917 --> 16:00.550
Yeah...then I will
die..happy..satisfied...

16:00.750 --> 16:02.467
Why is it a must to talk about
death right early in the morning?

16:02.667 --> 16:04.092
Why can't he talk
about something positive?

16:04.292 --> 16:05.717
What is so negative about death..

16:05.917 --> 16:07.842
I am changing the medication dear...

16:08.042 --> 16:10.467
you can alternate with this one...

16:10.667 --> 16:15.342
And remember one thing..where
there is a will..there is a way...

16:15.542 --> 16:17.394
...and the way is of outside only...

16:20.792 --> 16:22.092
Pappu you need to
leave for Motibaug...

16:22.292 --> 16:23.717
make sure you get there on time...
- Sure sir...

16:23.917 --> 16:25.800
God knows when the
winters will come...

16:26.000 --> 16:28.300
this summer has been harsh...

16:28.500 --> 16:29.342
I haven't caused it...

16:29.542 --> 16:30.592
did I say it's because of you...?

16:30.792 --> 16:31.842
Then why are you telling me

16:32.042 --> 16:33.467
That's because you're
sitting here so I am talking

16:33.667 --> 16:34.842
imagine that I am not
here and keep quiet...

16:35.042 --> 16:36.217
It's useless talking to you...

16:36.417 --> 16:38.895
So don't talk... go home
and don't come here from tomorrow...

16:39.167 --> 16:40.717
Why should I not come?

16:40.917 --> 16:41.967
Because I am trying to work..

16:42.167 --> 16:44.217
Oh really...even after been thrown out
of your job you still have such an ego?

16:44.417 --> 16:48.717
Why is it really important
for you to keep reminding me of that?

16:48.917 --> 16:50.644
But that's the truth...

16:52.542 --> 16:54.519
Himachal taxi stand..yes..

16:56.292 --> 16:57.217
No no I understand Rosy,

16:57.417 --> 17:00.396
but your Piku madam said she didn't want
any taxi from us so I didn't send anyone..

17:00.875 --> 17:01.976
Fine I'll send...

17:04.125 --> 17:06.978
Hey who's turn is it to drop
that madam from Chitranjan Park?

17:09.041 --> 17:10.394
Why are you guys silent...?

17:10.750 --> 17:13.137
She's a regular client...you'll
have to tolerate her...

17:13.625 --> 17:16.342
...and just because she insists on
driving fast doesn't mean you do that...

17:16.541 --> 17:17.717
...don't you have your own mind?

17:17.916 --> 17:21.226
See no one wants to go...
so why're you forcing them?

17:21.500 --> 17:23.762
One minute...don't you
talk like Union leaders here..

17:24.666 --> 17:26.019
Nannu...go take the car...

17:27.416 --> 17:30.967
and I am aware what you
and your daughter are up to...

17:31.167 --> 17:32.925
Ritu is your sister

17:33.125 --> 17:34.092
Whatever it is...just watch out...

17:34.292 --> 17:35.848
Excuse me!
- Yeah...you both

17:49.542 --> 17:50.842
Aunt...how are you...?

17:51.042 --> 17:52.519
Fine...
-Aah here she is..

17:52.792 --> 17:55.675
Hey Bhaskor da..how are you?

17:55.875 --> 17:56.842
Did you pass Motion?

17:57.042 --> 17:57.842
Hello ma'am.
- Hello.

17:58.042 --> 18:00.800
These sweet pills won't help
you much...start allopathy...

18:01.000 --> 18:01.550
illiterate“.

18:01.750 --> 18:02.300
Hi...

18:02.500 --> 18:03.592
Happy birthday sister..

18:03.792 --> 18:05.592
...so tell me what's the latest...?

18:05.792 --> 18:07.717
...nothing..usual..

18:07.917 --> 18:08.842
...how was your vacation?

18:09.042 --> 18:11.925
Shimla was fantastic..you
must go once..

18:12.125 --> 18:13.886
And enjoy yourself..

18:14.167 --> 18:16.050
Aah..mutton smelling good

18:16.250 --> 18:18.342
anyways..where is uncle?

18:18.542 --> 18:21.175
Why such a swollen face?
What happened?

18:21.375 --> 18:23.842
Well she isn't married yet..
that's why all this...

18:24.042 --> 18:26.967
...nothing serious I guess..
or am I missing something Piku?

18:27.167 --> 18:29.300
I mean I am not saying I want
to take a long holiday...

18:29.500 --> 18:31.675
...but may be just for a day or two
I can go somewhere".

18:31.875 --> 18:32.967
Piku's right..

18:33.167 --> 18:35.019
...every normal person
needs a break...

18:35.250 --> 18:36.717
...for relaxation.

18:36.917 --> 18:39.675
Oh nonsense...people aren't
relaxed in their own homes...

18:39.875 --> 18:42.050
...with their own families but
they don't mind spending...

18:42.250 --> 18:46.175
...on a train or a plane ticket
just to get to some far away hotel...

18:46.375 --> 18:49.092
...and using some else's
used beddings... to feel relaxed...

18:49.292 --> 18:51.842
...and these travel companies are
to blamed for it...it's all in the mind...

18:52.042 --> 18:54.717
lam telling you..find
a nice boy..and..

18:54.917 --> 18:56.925
Isn't your sex life active?

18:57.125 --> 18:59.592
Your partner...Syed?

18:59.792 --> 19:00.842
It's a need

19:01.042 --> 19:02.175
right..its a need...

19:02.375 --> 19:05.717
but that's not a permanent solution...
why don't you both get married ya..

19:05.917 --> 19:08.395
Aunt I don't know..I’m
not even sure..about him..

19:08.792 --> 19:09.842
Ah..again that useless topic..

19:10.042 --> 19:11.717
You don't know marriage
is a bad word in our house...?

19:11.917 --> 19:13.592
People with low IQ only get married

19:13.792 --> 19:16.675
...you mean I am low IQ?
My sister was low IQ?

19:16.875 --> 19:19.592
In this whole world everyone
who is married is low IQ? - Hi..hi...

19:19.792 --> 19:21.342
Hope you are good...

19:21.542 --> 19:22.842
your Telegraph..last 30 days“.

19:23.042 --> 19:24.967
Aah!
'lovely...!

19:25.167 --> 19:26.769
Nothing like Kolkata news..

19:27.250 --> 19:28.842
Don't change the topic dada..

19:29.042 --> 19:30.592
Don't waste your time..
- Again?

19:30.792 --> 19:35.717
To be together in
good times and bad...

19:35.917 --> 19:37.342
...is it low IQ?

19:37.542 --> 19:38.675
There's no salt in this...?

19:38.875 --> 19:40.727
I couldn't find salt...

19:41.375 --> 19:42.592
...to take care of
BP...best to avoid...

19:42.792 --> 19:44.342
But we don't have BP!

19:44.542 --> 19:45.925
So stop hiding like this..

19:46.125 --> 19:47.467
Again your changing the topic...?

19:47.667 --> 19:48.925
Was my sister low IQ?

19:49.125 --> 19:51.592
Not just constipation,
dad has problems with women too...

19:51.792 --> 19:55.842
No...not women but their
mentality is what I can't stand...

19:56.042 --> 19:59.842
"your sister too.-all her
life she just wanted to please me..

20:00.042 --> 20:02.717
...that was her only
purpose..no aim for herself..

20:02.917 --> 20:05.300
...I wanted her to
be independent...but no..

20:05.500 --> 20:07.800
...she surrendered
herself in my service..

20:08.000 --> 20:08.925
So what's wrong with that?

20:09.125 --> 20:09.967
Everything is wrong!

20:10.167 --> 20:13.717
Throwing away your identity..your
knowledge..respect..brain..

20:13.917 --> 20:18.717
In the fire while taking the seven
vows and then leading your life...

20:18.917 --> 20:20.592
...well that is a Low IQ decision..

20:20.792 --> 20:22.467
...and I don't want
Piku to take this decision.

20:22.667 --> 20:25.050
But brother, don't say like that
today, on sister's birthday at least..

20:25.250 --> 20:27.842
...when she was alive,
she was not happy...

20:28.042 --> 20:30.300
...when she was dying she was not happy
and now even after dying she is isn't happy...

20:30.500 --> 20:31.175
...see...that's what I mean...

20:31.375 --> 20:32.761
You're really insensitive dad..

20:33.167 --> 20:35.050
Piku.. she was my wife..
I can say anything..

20:35.250 --> 20:36.467
But she loved you..

20:36.667 --> 20:38.342
I also loved her..and still do..

20:38.542 --> 20:40.425
Then why are you criticizing mom...?

20:40.625 --> 20:42.300
Because I am a critical person..

20:42.500 --> 20:44.217
...brutal and honest.

20:44.417 --> 20:47.175
I am entitled to think
whatever I want to about her...

20:47.375 --> 20:49.217
...but that doesn't mean
that I don't love her...

20:49.417 --> 20:52.270
This shirt that I am wearing..

20:52.750 --> 20:55.050
...she gifted me on my birthday...

20:55.250 --> 20:57.011
...so I am wearing it for her today...

20:58.417 --> 21:00.967
Piku find a right man..and get married

21:01.167 --> 21:05.467
Leaving your father's home after getting
married and living in another man's house...

21:05.667 --> 21:07.425
...taking care of that
new one...how foolish...

21:07.625 --> 21:09.092
I gave birth to you...didn't I?
- yes

21:09.292 --> 21:10.592
No tell me...I gave birth to you..

21:10.792 --> 21:11.550
Yes Dad

21:11.750 --> 21:14.092
I never left you and went
away...so now I am your child..

21:14.292 --> 21:14.842
You do the same..

21:15.042 --> 21:18.342
I completely agree with
Bhaskor da's philosophy

21:18.542 --> 21:20.967
God knows how did my sister
tolerate you for all these years..

21:21.167 --> 21:24.592
...I don't know..no wonder she died
early..you only must've given her BP

21:24.792 --> 21:31.969
I give BP to you..to Piku,
even to Srivastava...did you all die?

21:33.542 --> 21:34.717
Would you like some Ice cream...?

21:34.917 --> 21:38.009
Obviously.
why I did I get it then?

21:42.167 --> 21:44.842
Oh just ignore what Piku
says...She doesn't mean it...

21:45.042 --> 21:49.342
Fine...I am giving these bills to the accounts
department...just get the payment released...

21:49.542 --> 21:52.050
of course...by the
way how's your mother?

21:52.250 --> 21:55.889
Don't even know how
I was born in that family...

21:56.167 --> 21:57.592
...just waiting to get out of there...

21:57.792 --> 22:01.635
...anyway tell your partner to mend her
ways or get used to travelling in a Metro

22:08.792 --> 22:09.768
Why don't you tell her...

22:16.667 --> 22:17.723
Piku..

22:18.167 --> 22:19.268
Piku..

22:20.125 --> 22:21.467
Hi..
- all well...?

22:21.667 --> 22:22.467
<i>Ya“</i>

22:22.667 --> 22:24.467
I know because of my drivers...

22:24.667 --> 22:25.842
look its fine..

22:26.042 --> 22:27.967
I don't have time for
all this discussion...

22:28.167 --> 22:29.894
So when should I come?

22:31.542 --> 22:33.842
<i>For what'?
- To discuss this</i> driver <i>issue...</i>

22:34.042 --> 22:35.050
you've had a word with Syed, right?

22:35.250 --> 22:36.476
Ya but..

22:36.750 --> 22:37.885
So then its fine...

22:41.042 --> 22:42.143
See you..

22:43.667 --> 22:44.723
Bye

22:51.917 --> 22:54.592
You need to be a
bit easy with Piku...

22:54.792 --> 22:56.175
...I am really worried for her..

22:56.375 --> 22:58.842
Oh...then why did you get married
thrice? If you were so worried..

22:59.042 --> 22:59.592
Excuse me?

22:59.792 --> 23:03.101
After Piku's mother passed away,
Piku needed you..

23:03.417 --> 23:06.592
So I should've shifted here
with Eisha in your house...

23:06.792 --> 23:07.967
...gotten married to you...

23:08.167 --> 23:09.092
...just because my sister
was no more...?

23:09.292 --> 23:10.467
Hah! only you can have
such idiotic thoughts..

23:10.667 --> 23:12.644
Piku and Eisha..were
never your priority...

23:13.042 --> 23:15.217
All I am saying is
that..and that is very sad..

23:15.417 --> 23:16.300
Is this why you don't like me...?

23:16.500 --> 23:20.967
No I've enough reasons
to not like you...

23:21.167 --> 23:25.602
...But don't you feed this marriage
nonsense in Piku's mind, don't..

23:33.125 --> 23:36.467
Grand Pa doesn't want to meet you...

23:36.667 --> 23:40.550
tell him I am not here to
discuss the selling of Kolkata house

23:40.750 --> 23:43.342
then why are you here?
to know the condition of my stomach?

23:43.542 --> 23:45.425
Good evening dada; how are you..

23:45.625 --> 23:48.092
Actually I met a builder yesterday..
he is ready to negotiate...

23:48.292 --> 23:52.175
...so I spent my own money
for the flight ticket

23:52.375 --> 23:54.092
...just to come and meet you..

23:54.292 --> 23:55.800
You know my decision...

23:56.000 --> 23:56.592
Dada..try and understand

23:56.792 --> 23:58.342
There is no need to discuss
the same topic again and again...

23:58.542 --> 23:59.717
Go!
- It's a golden opportunity...

23:59.917 --> 24:02.842
...super deal..all these things must
be done while you're still here...

24:03.042 --> 24:04.342
...then you can peacefully...

24:04.542 --> 24:05.967
listen Budhan...
- yes Grand Pa..

24:06.167 --> 24:07.467
Hope you haven't
made tea for him yet...?

24:07.667 --> 24:08.550
lam about to...

24:08.750 --> 24:10.467
no need...no need..

24:10.667 --> 24:12.175
...just shut the door when
this man leaves...

24:12.375 --> 24:14.227
...and don't open it
if he comes back again...

24:14.667 --> 24:15.717
Irritating man.

24:15.917 --> 24:18.395
Oh that's an insult!

24:18.625 --> 24:22.764
I made so much of effort
to negotiate with the builder...

24:23.000 --> 24:24.342
is this how you treat me?

24:24.542 --> 24:26.467
...I'll tell Piku didi...she's practical
and will dispose off your house...

24:26.667 --> 24:28.098
Ya fine...go ahead...

24:29.042 --> 24:30.967
I rang the bell for an hour...

24:31.167 --> 24:33.599
useless old man...wasted my time..

24:37.125 --> 24:38.467
...126!88..
its normal.

24:38.667 --> 24:39.717
How are you respected sir?

24:39.917 --> 24:42.300
Very serious..BP is normal..

24:42.500 --> 24:43.675
This is not a joke Piku..

24:43.875 --> 24:44.717
Please sit

24:44.917 --> 24:45.592
Greetings ma'am..

24:45.792 --> 24:48.842
That idiot, Nobendu, he again came last night
to discuss the selling of Kolkata house...

24:49.042 --> 24:49.842
I will not sell that house..

24:50.042 --> 24:51.842
That old house is a pain!
- what?

24:52.042 --> 24:52.967
Pain!

24:53.167 --> 24:56.146
I have told you before...l
will not sell CHAMPA KUNJ!

24:56.500 --> 24:57.967
...this year I will go to Kolkata!..

24:58.167 --> 25:00.592
I have decided..end of discussion!

25:00.792 --> 25:02.092
Fine then end this discussion

25:02.292 --> 25:05.967
Tell Nobendu not to come again...
what's there to get so affected...

25:06.167 --> 25:06.717
Affected?

25:06.917 --> 25:08.675
Of course I'll be...
I am an emotional man...

25:08.875 --> 25:11.467
If you were emotional...my
sister would've been happy..

25:11.667 --> 25:16.050
Listen you Dutta sisters...
I know your habit of blame game...

25:16.250 --> 25:18.467
...and I worry..my Piku
is also becoming like one of you..

25:18.667 --> 25:20.592
...what your Banerjis are like,
well I also know that..

25:20.792 --> 25:23.467
That Moni Banerji...your Aunt

25:23.667 --> 25:26.717
Piku...whole day she roams around in
the house in just a flimsy night gown...

25:26.917 --> 25:27.842
...that too without a Bra...!

25:28.042 --> 25:29.800
Really Aunty?!
- Maa even you do the same..

25:30.000 --> 25:33.092
Hey...shut up...I Only do
that when I am alone at home...!

25:33.500 --> 25:36.967
Anyways...what's the point in getting
BP checked 100 times in a day...

25:37.167 --> 25:40.342
...whatever this Nobendu came
and said and you started panicking?

25:40.542 --> 25:45.050
...these are all age related
problems...what's so abnormal in it...?

25:45.250 --> 25:46.425
But...what if my BP shoots up?

25:46.625 --> 25:48.842
Everyone has some issue or
the other in their lives...

25:49.042 --> 25:51.550
...just for a day if you haven't crapped,
there isn't any need for this drama!

25:51.750 --> 25:55.592
Nothing has happened to you; you are
just simply going through menopause...

25:55.792 --> 25:57.849
even men go through menopause...

25:58.292 --> 25:59.427
Oh ignore what she's saying...

26:02.917 --> 26:06.842
...no way...here take
a look..he's Asaako...

26:07.042 --> 26:10.217
he cycled even at the age of 99...

26:10.417 --> 26:11.175
died just last week...

26:11.375 --> 26:12.636
how did he die?

26:13.500 --> 26:15.800
Heart attack..cancer..brain damage...?

26:16.000 --> 26:16.717
Nothing's written here...

26:16.917 --> 26:21.727
He who cycles even at the age of 99,
what can he suffer from...?

26:26.042 --> 26:28.395
Hey!
Stop stop Stop---

26:32.000 --> 26:34.137
ls this your cycle...?

26:38.167 --> 26:38.925
Sir, I'll be late...

26:39.125 --> 26:40.092

- Wait wait wait

26:40.292 --> 26:41.842

26:42.042 --> 26:43.342
just a few minutes more...

26:43.542 --> 26:44.800
I need to go to other houses too sir

26:45.000 --> 26:47.137
Ya I know...its okay...

26:47.375 --> 26:49.102
Didi will scold...

26:51.875 --> 26:55.138
Don't push...I am trying to balance...
- Careful...

26:55.875 --> 26:58.092
Hey don't push...it'll turn...

26:58.292 --> 27:00.224
Careful...

27:02.542 --> 27:03.598
What...

27:08.542 --> 27:11.350
Sanju is coming to have a talk...

27:12.375 --> 27:15.092
...go change your clothes
or go to the stand...

27:15.292 --> 27:17.144
Why what's wrong with these clothes?

27:17.542 --> 27:19.474
...and in any case he's not
coming to take you back with him..

27:19.917 --> 27:21.342
Look what he's saying mom...

27:21.542 --> 27:23.842
at least we can ask for a settlement?

27:24.042 --> 27:26.967
Well he's already left you
so what are you going to settle?

27:27.167 --> 27:30.510
Now earn...live your
life...respectfully

27:30.750 --> 27:34.967
You're just frustrated and
you don't want even me to be happy...

27:35.167 --> 27:36.300
If you were so worried
about your happiness then..

27:36.500 --> 27:38.217
...why did you steal your mother-in-law's
diamond ring and give it to mom?

27:38.417 --> 27:39.592
It wasn't your
ring...that she stole...

27:39.792 --> 27:41.592
what does he have anyways

27:41.792 --> 27:43.849
Do you even know what honesty means?

27:44.417 --> 27:46.717
...treachery never brings
happiness...do you get that?

27:46.917 --> 27:47.925
As if you've been righteous always...

27:48.125 --> 27:51.718
...exactly...how do we know why
were you thrown out from your job...

27:52.167 --> 27:55.146
Hello..again..where? Honda..

27:56.542 --> 27:57.592
What the taxi's been hit again...

27:57.792 --> 27:59.144
Who was the client?

28:00.125 --> 28:01.467
Tch..Piku..again...

28:01.667 --> 28:04.020
...three drivers have left us already

28:07.375 --> 28:10.763
Hello Syed...look now this
another taxi has also been hit...

28:11.125 --> 28:13.262
...no we need to sort
this out my friend

28:15.542 --> 28:17.519
...ok...I'll see you tomorrow

28:27.250 --> 28:28.717
Played after ages..

28:28.917 --> 28:29.800
Yeah...

28:30.000 --> 28:31.175
Going back to Saudi...?

28:31.375 --> 28:32.842
Not again..

28:33.042 --> 28:34.967
Aah Piku is here..l
thought you gonna bunk..

28:35.167 --> 28:35.842
It wasn't my fault...

28:36.042 --> 28:38.092
...shall we leave...? - My
driver must've delayed you...isn't it?

28:38.292 --> 28:42.260
You guys chat..I'll just get my Laptop

28:53.250 --> 28:57.264
Well...whatever it may be...these are known
drivers...you're safe with them...

28:57.667 --> 29:00.467
...not only do they listen
to you...they're also scared of you...

29:00.667 --> 29:01.300
Nothing like that...

29:01.500 --> 29:02.467
So what about that Honda case...?

29:02.667 --> 29:05.842
I was getting late for a meeting
so I asked him to speed up...

29:06.042 --> 29:08.342
...normal speeding up...he banged...

29:08.542 --> 29:11.760
this time again you told
him not to stop after banging...

29:12.000 --> 29:13.967
...and even if he did,
Delhi Police listens only to women...

29:14.167 --> 29:15.342
...no matter whoever's
fault it may be...

29:15.542 --> 29:17.217
you mean I am making
them break the rules?

29:17.417 --> 29:19.425
No no I have no problems
with that...break them,

29:19.625 --> 29:21.511
as long as no one gets hurt...

29:23.375 --> 29:25.637
...in any case I send the
damages to your office so it's Ok...

29:25.875 --> 29:31.592
No it's not ok...I can take
an auto...I can manage myself...

29:31.792 --> 29:35.550
...c'mon Piku; he's just saying that he
has some decent drivers working for him..

29:35.750 --> 29:37.102
So it's my fault?

29:38.917 --> 29:42.800
See the point is, everything is mutual...
you don't like them, they don't like you..

29:43.000 --> 29:44.261
Did they say this...?

29:44.792 --> 29:47.145
No, but does it matter...

29:47.792 --> 29:49.769
...when it's the truth..

29:55.292 --> 29:56.723
Got to leave...

29:57.542 --> 29:58.518
okay.

30:00.792 --> 30:03.975
There won't be a
need to take an auto...

30:07.417 --> 30:08.518
See you..

30:12.042 --> 30:13.217
He's rude..

30:13.417 --> 30:14.467
Don't be so judgmental..

30:14.667 --> 30:16.800
Obviously he's your friend
you are going to take his side..

30:17.000 --> 30:18.135
It's not like that..

30:19.250 --> 30:20.135
...sit

30:24.792 --> 30:26.144
You know what

30:26.917 --> 30:27.717
What?

30:27.917 --> 30:29.143
I need a break...

30:31.250 --> 30:33.182
...I won't come to
office for a few days

30:34.917 --> 30:38.510
Piku how am I supposed
to run this firm?

30:39.042 --> 30:40.268
...Piku..listen...

31:10.500 --> 31:12.511

31:16.667 --> 31:20.385
Budhan..how many times to tell you
not to put the tea leaves in the basin

31:28.167 --> 31:30.270

31:32.292 --> 31:37.228

31:50.042 --> 31:52.300

Hello..

32:00.917 --> 32:02.050

32:02.250 --> 32:03.592

you're taking an auto...

32:03.792 --> 32:04.967
I said I don't need your taxi.

32:05.167 --> 32:06.925

34:13.625 --> 34:15.217

She's financially independent...
sexually independent...

34:18.125 --> 34:21.467

for emotional partnership..

34:21.667 --> 34:24.717

...but you didn't open the
door so I called for Dr. Srivastava...

36:34.000 --> 36:35.092
Nothing to worry...

36:35.292 --> 36:37.925

pulse drop...that's it...

36:38.125 --> 36:39.967
...Dr Mukherjee has
given him medicines...

36:40.167 --> 36:41.894
right now he's ok..

36:42.417 --> 36:45.020
At his age,
we should not take any risks...

36:46.417 --> 36:48.175

36:48.375 --> 36:50.261
It's a must..

38:43.667 --> 38:45.925
No uncle, I am not worried for him...

38:46.125 --> 38:48.050
...in fact it makes
no difference to him...

38:48.250 --> 38:51.050
...if he wants to go he'll go...he
doesn't care about anybody else.

38:51.250 --> 38:55.342
Now do I write on a stamp paper that
I will not die during this trip...

38:55.542 --> 38:57.217
...will that be fine.

38:57.417 --> 38:58.842
Look at his health.

38:59.042 --> 39:03.717
Forget logic...from here to
airport and from there to Kolkata...

39:03.917 --> 39:04.717
It's too much Dada

39:04.917 --> 39:07.217
Flight?
Who said I'll take a flight...?

39:07.417 --> 39:10.467
I'll get palpitations on it...
- Give me some tea

39:10.667 --> 39:12.467
BP fluctuates at that height.

39:12.667 --> 39:17.637
...bathrooms are claustrophobic
palpitation...nervousness.

39:17.917 --> 39:19.467
Its bad for my condition.

39:19.667 --> 39:21.717
I am not going by train certainly.

39:21.917 --> 39:23.143
Train? Never.

39:23.667 --> 39:28.842
Never.. never... this train movement
shakes up everything inside...

39:29.042 --> 39:30.925
I get constipation.

39:31.125 --> 39:32.511
That is not a good option.

39:32.750 --> 39:34.217
Just five days back
you've gotten up from bed.

39:34.417 --> 39:37.342
Could've died...it was
my marriage anniversary...

39:37.542 --> 39:39.592
...why did he have to drink and dance?

39:39.792 --> 39:43.592
And then he comes home...drinks...
Budhan why did you give him the drink?

39:43.792 --> 39:45.592
Piku you also didn't bother.

39:45.792 --> 39:47.092
This old man has gone senile!

39:47.292 --> 39:49.467
Look you don't interfere.

39:49.667 --> 39:50.592
No one is asking you.

39:50.792 --> 39:53.967
You're my sister's husband
that's why I am concerned...

39:54.167 --> 39:56.850
But your sister is no more..
so keep quiet.

39:57.125 --> 39:58.467
Hey shrivastava.

39:58.667 --> 40:00.592
There is one way.

40:00.792 --> 40:01.800
I've an idea.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.050
I was thinking exactly the same...

40:04.250 --> 40:10.842
...you might get tired but
then you can stop anywhere and walk...

40:11.042 --> 40:13.092
Correct..correct..correct.

40:13.292 --> 40:15.599
That way things will be in control.

40:16.292 --> 40:18.217
According to my convenience.

40:18.417 --> 40:19.842
<i>Yes</i>

40:20.042 --> 40:20.973
As in?

40:21.625 --> 40:25.844
As in nothing...done...decided!

40:31.542 --> 40:34.092
Who'll drive that madam
from CR park to Kolkata?

40:34.292 --> 40:36.395
Day after morning at 4.30 am...
who's duty is it?

40:39.542 --> 40:40.925
Come on she's not bad at heart.

40:41.125 --> 40:43.762
Alright then Dhani Raam.. take
the car that has a carrier on top.

40:48.042 --> 40:49.268
Here...take this.

40:50.292 --> 40:51.348
Here...

40:51.750 --> 40:55.389
take out the other two
suitcases kept in the garage

41:01.250 --> 41:02.511
Budhan

41:03.667 --> 41:06.395
All this will not
fit in one suitcase...

41:07.417 --> 41:08.894
...need another one

41:22.917 --> 41:24.519
He should be here any moment

41:40.625 --> 41:41.592
Where's your Driver?

41:41.792 --> 41:43.675
Am sure he must be on his way...

41:43.875 --> 41:45.175
...or may have stopped
for some fuel perhaps.

41:45.375 --> 41:47.512
I've been calling you since 4 am!

41:47.792 --> 41:49.394
I'll check

42:17.167 --> 42:20.175
Hello. - I told you my father will
be travelling too...he's an old man.

42:20.375 --> 42:22.092
Let me talk to him...and I am not old!
- dad.

42:22.292 --> 42:23.800
Sorry Piku.. I can't get
through any driver just now...so.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.842
We've been waiting for over two hours
now...with our luggage all packed...

42:26.042 --> 42:27.217
...and you are telling
me there is no driver.

42:27.417 --> 42:29.842
Look look..I am trying...
just give me some time.

42:30.042 --> 42:32.717
If you don't know how to do business
then why did you even take the booking?

42:32.917 --> 42:34.467
How's your shouting gonna help?

42:34.667 --> 42:36.550
You just don't talk
in a civilized manner...

42:36.750 --> 42:38.342
...and that's the reason none
of the drivers want to go with you...

42:38.542 --> 42:40.217
...do you understand this? - In that
case you should've told me the truth!

42:40.417 --> 42:41.175
Ya so even I didn't know this...

42:41.375 --> 42:43.136
...that after listening your
name itself the drivers will run away!

42:45.625 --> 42:47.227
God.

43:06.042 --> 43:09.217
Oh I thought you guys would've
left by now...what happened?

43:09.417 --> 43:10.300
Driver didn't turn up.

43:10.500 --> 43:15.967
Good...now take a flight later...
useless plans end up like this only.

43:16.167 --> 43:19.842
I thought passing motion before this journey
will give me some relief on the way...

43:20.042 --> 43:21.467
...but no...it's
all hardened inside...

43:21.667 --> 43:23.967
Been on hold for 10 minutes
now... these airline idiots

43:24.167 --> 43:26.467
But why are you calling flight?
Call the driver.

43:26.667 --> 43:28.394
Call the driver.

43:29.292 --> 43:30.393
Piku.

43:31.667 --> 43:32.393
Piku.

43:34.542 --> 43:35.717
None of the drivers
are ready to go...

43:35.917 --> 43:37.967
...so...is this the luggage...
should I keep it outside...?

43:38.167 --> 43:39.217
Is he the driver?

43:39.417 --> 43:41.300
Budhan keep the luggage in the car

43:41.500 --> 43:43.675
ls this the time to come?

43:43.875 --> 43:45.592
Because of you my stomach...

43:45.792 --> 43:46.342
stomach?

43:46.542 --> 43:47.717
What is your owner's name?

43:47.917 --> 43:49.467
Dad.. he is the owner.

43:49.667 --> 43:50.893
He is the owner.

43:51.167 --> 43:54.717
Oh so he's that same irritating
owner you told me about?

43:54.917 --> 43:55.925
Well if the owner is like him...

43:56.125 --> 43:58.717
...then obviously people under
him will also be as useless.

43:58.917 --> 44:00.894
Keep this up...

44:02.417 --> 44:03.217
do you know mister...

44:03.417 --> 44:04.842
...because of you my daughter
is going through so much stress.

44:05.042 --> 44:05.967
Dad please.

44:06.167 --> 44:08.050
No...wait a minute...what
is your name...?

44:08.250 --> 44:09.717
RANA.. CHOUDHARY.

44:09.917 --> 44:11.175
Choudhary?

44:11.375 --> 44:14.550
Are you a Bengali?
- no.. UP..thakur.

44:14.750 --> 44:16.342
UP...?
wherein UP?

44:16.542 --> 44:17.675
Sandila.. district Hardoi.

44:17.875 --> 44:19.342
Oh that place is
famous for its sweets...

44:19.542 --> 44:21.342
...get us a kilo or two
when you go there next time.

44:21.542 --> 44:24.521
So you are going to take
us...where is your license

44:24.917 --> 44:25.342
What license?

44:25.542 --> 44:26.925
Driving license...?
- ya I have...

44:27.125 --> 44:28.217
Check if the taxi
has a carrier or not.

44:28.417 --> 44:30.842
And keep both the suitcase in
the front seat if there is no place...

44:31.042 --> 44:32.394
Where is it?

44:34.167 --> 44:38.135
Had I known there'll be so much
of luggage, I would've got a mini bus.

44:38.667 --> 44:40.175
Do you have any medical issue?

44:40.375 --> 44:42.925
Eye sight...?
night blindness...? day blindness?

44:43.125 --> 44:44.675
Glasses...?
- Dad.. do all this later.

44:44.875 --> 44:45.217
Sir..everything is...fine.

44:45.417 --> 44:46.717
Why a medical test now?

44:46.917 --> 44:47.592
Any bad habit?

44:47.792 --> 44:48.842
Piku have you kept water?

44:49.042 --> 44:50.050
Cigarette.. drinking?

44:50.250 --> 44:52.342
You know...
Drinking driving.. zipping.

44:52.542 --> 44:54.467
...then.. bang.. accident..
has it happened to you ever?

44:54.667 --> 44:58.092
As if he's gonna tell you?

44:58.292 --> 45:01.592
What a question?
- no.. fortunately no sir

45:01.792 --> 45:05.385
Are you speaking the truth?
I don't want to go with a liar!

45:05.792 --> 45:07.092
Sir... we're already late.

45:07.292 --> 45:08.342
I think we must leave.

45:08.542 --> 45:10.425
Remaining questions
you can ask me on the way.

45:10.625 --> 45:13.092
I am an honest man...can

45:13.292 --> 45:14.393
Ya...

45:14.792 --> 45:16.342

45:26.917 --> 45:28.894
I think you all must leave now...

45:39.042 --> 45:40.592

45:45.542 --> 45:48.020
Bye..take care

45:49.042 --> 45:50.092
Oh Respected brother..

45:50.292 --> 45:53.384
Choudhary..

45:54.250 --> 45:56.136
Hey Budhan .

45:56.792 --> 45:58.269
This...

46:02.750 --> 46:04.511
Now where will this fit?

46:04.792 --> 46:06.223
Anywhere.

46:10.167 --> 46:10.847
Bye.

46:36.375 --> 46:38.478
Budhan...sit behind

46:43.917 --> 46:47.009
What are you exchanging the seats for?

47:02.167 --> 47:03.717
What route are you planning to take?

47:03.917 --> 47:06.925
Yamuna expressway...
then Agra bypass.

47:07.125 --> 47:08.977
I am asking up till Kolkata.

47:13.417 --> 47:14.769
Its marked in Red.

47:16.792 --> 47:21.181
Noida, Yamuna express way,
Agra bypass, Firozabad, Kanpur,

47:25.042 --> 47:27.592
Gaya, Assansol, Durgapur, Kolkata.

47:27.792 --> 47:28.800
Oh god...

47:29.000 --> 47:31.092
...that's some distance... its far!

47:31.292 --> 47:32.217
How much time will it take?

47:32.417 --> 47:33.592
Of course it's far .

47:33.792 --> 47:34.800
1500 km.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.967
I didn't ask in Kilometer...l
asked you time..

47:37.167 --> 47:38.592
40 to 45 hours.

47:38.792 --> 47:40.474
...could be more also.

47:42.042 --> 47:43.800
Hope you don't intend
to drive after dark?

47:44.000 --> 47:44.925
...night halt?

47:45.125 --> 47:48.513
Haven't thought about it
...maybe Benaras.

47:51.500 --> 47:53.887
Hey...sit on the seat...idiot!

47:57.125 --> 47:58.425
Yes I'll send the vehicle...
- Should I...

47:58.625 --> 47:59.717
Should l...?
- No...

47:59.917 --> 48:01.473
Go with him...

48:02.167 --> 48:03.769
Where's the toilet...?

48:04.167 --> 48:05.925
Hey Budhan come..

48:06.125 --> 48:07.761
Fill up the tank...

48:22.750 --> 48:24.011
Keep saying...

48:32.542 --> 48:34.394
ya ya fine..done..

48:39.375 --> 48:40.510
What was that?

48:42.250 --> 48:43.092
Where's dad...?

48:43.292 --> 48:44.848
He'll take some time...

48:58.042 --> 48:59.550
Where's the next stop...?

48:59.750 --> 49:01.352
Not before two hours...

49:01.750 --> 49:04.057
...after that wherever we find a
decent place...we'll stop for breakfast...

49:05.792 --> 49:06.925
That's too far...!

49:07.125 --> 49:12.217
This is why I didn't want us to drive down.
unnecessarily you force your decisions.

49:12.417 --> 49:16.300
Naa ...I never forced.
I said. You agreed.

49:16.500 --> 49:17.635
And you also..

49:18.167 --> 49:22.050
When the driver didn't turn up...l
almost decided we'll go by flight...

49:22.250 --> 49:24.057
...who told you to come last minute...

49:26.417 --> 49:29.467
What?! Why are you
dragging me into this...

49:29.667 --> 49:31.592
I didn't load your luggage forcibly...

49:31.792 --> 49:35.351
...I would've dropped you
at the airport had you asked me to...

49:36.542 --> 49:40.342
we can go back even now...
if you want to that is...

49:40.542 --> 49:41.467
Go back?

49:41.667 --> 49:43.092
Who said about going back?

49:43.292 --> 49:45.050
What..tell me..
- He said...

49:45.250 --> 49:49.014
Look mister...don't you
interfere in our family matter..

49:49.792 --> 49:52.520
...in my house I decide
everything...got it?

49:52.792 --> 49:55.092
But this is a car..that too his..

49:55.292 --> 49:57.895
I know it.. donkey!

49:58.167 --> 49:59.769
...here...press this...

50:01.625 --> 50:05.217
and Piku..you said you wanted
an 'adventure trip' so this is it..

50:05.417 --> 50:09.385
...adventurous trip you wanted
to go out of Delhi...here it is

50:10.042 --> 50:15.979
...so enjoy..sing song..
what was that song...

50:17.042 --> 50:21.386
'what if this road never ends.

50:22.417 --> 50:28.638
'How will it be...tell me my dear'

50:29.000 --> 50:32.764
'what if this road never ends'

50:33.417 --> 50:37.385
'How will it be...tell me my dear'

50:37.792 --> 50:38.643
Tell me

50:39.250 --> 50:40.342
You tell me

50:40.542 --> 50:41.425
No no you tell me

50:41.625 --> 50:42.977
you..

50:43.417 --> 50:45.144
You tell...

50:45.792 --> 50:51.092
so Mr. non Bengali Choudhary..do
you know the meaning of this song?

50:51.292 --> 50:54.592
This path...this road that we are on..

50:54.792 --> 50:57.592
...if it never ends,
how will that be...?

50:57.792 --> 51:01.260
Well then sing another song,
that has a better meaning..

51:01.875 --> 51:04.763
...to appreciate good
music is also an art...

52:22.167 --> 52:25.601
Whoever wants to do whatever... can do
it here...we won't stop here for long

52:29.417 --> 52:30.467
Where are you...?

52:30.667 --> 52:32.592
You're asking as if you
really are worried for me..

52:32.792 --> 52:34.269
Why aren't you telling..

52:35.417 --> 52:35.925
Kolkata..

52:36.125 --> 52:37.217
What happened?

52:37.417 --> 52:40.217
Bath room's very dirty..it's
morning hours...

52:40.417 --> 52:41.842
...people must've used it..

52:42.042 --> 52:44.092
...God knows when will Grand Pa use it..

52:44.292 --> 52:45.342
Keep down the phone...

52:45.542 --> 52:46.842
All the driver are
sitting on my head..

52:47.042 --> 52:49.725
I'll handle them
and don't take any bookings

52:53.667 --> 52:55.050
Haven't you informed at home?

52:55.250 --> 52:56.260
No..

52:58.292 --> 53:01.384
...so what is your
father's real problem?

53:02.917 --> 53:03.973
Nothing..

53:05.417 --> 53:06.973
...a weak stomach...that's it...

53:07.250 --> 53:09.762
Then tell him to do
it fast..we need to leave...

53:10.000 --> 53:11.300
...in any case we
have that 'throne'...

53:11.500 --> 53:13.217
...wherever he feels the urge,
we'll stop...

53:13.417 --> 53:14.803
He doesn't eat unless he...

53:19.167 --> 53:20.348
...there he is...

53:24.417 --> 53:26.394
...not looking happy though..

53:29.667 --> 53:31.770
Did the army win the war...?

53:32.000 --> 53:37.015
...a bit.. there were so many
mosquitoes that I could not concentrate.

53:38.417 --> 53:40.092
You don't have to meditate...

53:40.292 --> 53:43.885
...this is the only job that happens
on its own...without any effort

53:46.042 --> 53:47.098
Bill!

53:51.500 --> 53:53.477
So much butter..

53:59.875 --> 54:00.925
Checked?

54:01.125 --> 54:02.386
Ye sir all safe

54:08.542 --> 54:11.550
In the morning when I got the call, it seemed
you needed to reach Kolkata today itself...

54:11.750 --> 54:14.342
...but the way family is going now...

54:14.542 --> 54:17.550
...as if out for a picnic... forget 48,
we'll not reach Kolkata even in 72 hours..

54:17.750 --> 54:19.592
Yes...what was the need of
stopping there to buy bangles...

54:19.792 --> 54:20.967
...she could have bought them
at Kolkata...

54:21.167 --> 54:22.717
she has got no sense of time..

54:22.917 --> 54:24.769
I have no sense of time...

54:26.792 --> 54:30.635
You're not going to let me get married...
let me enjoy these bangles at least

54:33.000 --> 54:34.477
Seriously?

54:35.667 --> 54:37.300
Most people here would marry off
their daughters just when they're born

54:37.500 --> 54:39.477
and he doesn't want
you to get married...?

54:40.292 --> 54:41.848
That's strange...

54:43.042 --> 54:44.717
...this doesn't happen
even in western culture..

54:44.917 --> 54:47.770
Western culture is not a benchmark
of progress..is that clear?

54:48.250 --> 54:52.890
We were always ahead of them...
always..that..a..Rani Laxmi Bai,

54:53.500 --> 54:56.592
Sarojini Naidu,
and...Kadimbini Ganguly,

54:56.792 --> 54:58.967
Vijay Laxmi Pandit...Annie Besant..

54:59.167 --> 55:02.800
...all these fine women spent their
whole life in sewing the country

55:03.000 --> 55:04.550
and all she wants
to do is please a boy?!

55:04.750 --> 55:07.842
So many times I have told
you Annie Besant wasn't an Indian...

55:08.542 --> 55:11.020
Still she fought for
our country's independence...!

55:11.375 --> 55:13.550
But all these women were married..

55:13.750 --> 55:15.092
Yes...but with a purpose.
Marriage is not wrong...

55:15.292 --> 55:17.842
Marriage is not wrong...but
it must have a purpose...

55:18.042 --> 55:22.092
All that a husband wants is that wife should
serve food during the day and sex at night...

55:22.292 --> 55:26.550
...but is that what a
woman is made for...nooo...

55:26.750 --> 55:30.889
that is why marriage
without any purpose is low IQ

55:31.667 --> 55:35.092
Fine but not all women
are nice and simple...

55:35.292 --> 55:39.681
...you don't know...many of them
are very manipulative and scheming...

55:41.292 --> 55:44.717
Women should be scheming...it's not
wrong... because man is like that...

55:44.917 --> 55:48.760
...that's why it's alright
for her to be scheming...

55:56.625 --> 55:58.352
What are you looking at her for?

56:01.667 --> 56:03.223
No aunty...

56:04.292 --> 56:07.384
...ya Driver is fine...hmm...

56:08.375 --> 56:09.636
...about half way

56:20.667 --> 56:22.342
listen..they're not bad people..

56:22.542 --> 56:24.842
No sometimes that man talks
sense...then suddenly he loses it..

56:25.042 --> 56:26.425
You want the slippers now ...?

56:26.625 --> 56:27.467
Yes...
- Why do you want it now?

56:27.667 --> 56:29.592
I feel I just unnecessarily
got carried away and now I am stuck...

56:29.792 --> 56:31.467
...between this crazy
father-daughter duo...

56:31.667 --> 56:33.175
As if you had a great life at home...

56:33.375 --> 56:36.388
I might just run away
in between...I am telling you".

56:39.042 --> 56:42.385
No still too far...not
even half way...

56:42.750 --> 56:45.512
I don't know if they really want to get
there or they're just on a joy ride...

56:46.667 --> 56:48.770
hey...look there ..I had kept
my slippers in the bag.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.011
Budhan had kept it in the suitcase

56:52.792 --> 56:54.550
found...
- can't hear you..bad signal..

56:54.750 --> 56:56.511
Budhan kept it...?

57:01.667 --> 57:03.974
What's this...?

57:06.750 --> 57:08.175
...are you planning to kill him?

57:08.375 --> 57:10.342
Mad or what ?
It's his...

57:10.542 --> 57:12.092
Oh is he planning a murder?

57:12.292 --> 57:13.800
Perhaps for safety

57:14.000 --> 57:14.675
safety. . .!

57:14.875 --> 57:16.342
What can we do to him...?

57:16.542 --> 57:20.852
No no this is very dangerous...
hey Piku it is very dangerous..

57:21.417 --> 57:23.269
...hey...where...?

57:25.500 --> 57:28.388
One Minute...I'll call you later...

57:29.042 --> 57:30.394
...what's this...

57:32.042 --> 57:35.467
...oh maybe...the driver
has kept it...for safety...

57:35.667 --> 57:37.217
...we're on the highway
so...keep it inside...

57:37.417 --> 57:42.011
listen ...don't you know what's
kept in your car and what's not...?

57:42.375 --> 57:44.592
You are lying You are lying..
you must've only hidden it

57:44.792 --> 57:46.342
sir...I don't even know how
to use it ...i am telling you...

57:46.542 --> 57:47.717
No no no!
I won't travel with you

57:47.917 --> 57:49.092
What...?

57:49.292 --> 57:51.092
No no... I can't trust somebody...

57:51.292 --> 57:53.842
.-.who has a knife--.! - Dad.- don't
create fuss in middle of the road..

57:54.042 --> 57:55.842
Please uncle trust me ..trust me...
- I am not your uncle..

57:56.042 --> 57:57.092

57:57.292 --> 57:59.842
...I'll just not go...you
first throw this knife...

58:00.042 --> 58:01.842
otherwise I am not going..
- How can I throw it...

58:02.042 --> 58:03.800
No you throw it--.take
it in your hand and throw

58:04.000 --> 58:05.217
I can't...it was kept in the car

58:05.417 --> 58:06.717
So you agree it was kept in the car...

58:06.917 --> 58:09.592
...I had told you I don't
want to travel with a liar...

58:09.792 --> 58:10.967
lam not a liar...
- You are a liar..

58:11.167 --> 58:12.967
lam not a liar...I can't throw it...
- You are a liar..

58:13.167 --> 58:15.592
Whole journey is left ...there is
a girl with us...how can I throw it?

58:15.792 --> 58:17.092
Girl?..she's my daughter...

58:17.292 --> 58:19.092
fine.. but how can I throw it?
she's also my responsibility...

58:19.292 --> 58:21.092
No you have to
- I won't

58:21.292 --> 58:22.592
You will...otherwise I am not going

58:22.792 --> 58:23.552
Keep screaming..

58:27.417 --> 58:28.217
Ok...!

58:28.417 --> 58:29.175
Now sit inside...

58:29.375 --> 58:31.478

to pick this up and throw..

58:34.250 --> 58:36.637
...throw it otherwise
I am not going...

58:37.292 --> 58:38.974
I am not throwing it...

59:20.625 --> 59:21.726
What happened?

59:22.500 --> 59:24.477
Did the tyre get punctured?

59:27.417 --> 59:28.643
Why don't you throw it?

01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:05.265
There's nothing else here...relax...

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:37.012
So you must be having another
source of income as well...

01:00:40.625 --> 01:00:41.886
sorry...?

01:00:42.167 --> 01:00:42.925
Another source of income...?

01:00:43.125 --> 01:00:43.675
None.

01:00:43.875 --> 01:00:44.592
Are you sure?

01:00:44.792 --> 01:00:45.643
Dad..

01:00:47.792 --> 01:00:49.967
Since when are you
running this taxi business?

01:00:50.167 --> 01:00:52.342
It was my father's
business actually...so I...

01:00:52.542 --> 01:00:56.385
oh the greed to earn more money...

01:00:56.792 --> 01:00:58.269
I had a job earlier...

01:00:58.500 --> 01:00:59.601
Where?

01:01:00.250 --> 01:01:02.637
Saudi...civil construction.

01:01:03.167 --> 01:01:07.101
Is this what an Engineer does to
earn a living? A taxi business? Sad..

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.515
They'd promised a big position
at the time of the interview...

01:01:12.917 --> 01:01:14.717
but once I got there...l
realized I was duped...

01:01:14.917 --> 01:01:16.473
Why didn't you come back?

01:01:17.375 --> 01:01:19.175
My passport was them
with a contract of two years!

01:01:19.375 --> 01:01:20.550
God! but who gives the passport

01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:23.175
That's the way it is...

01:01:23.375 --> 01:01:24.342
So then...?

01:01:24.542 --> 01:01:28.342
I had a tiff with my supervisor,
even though I was right...

01:01:28.542 --> 01:01:29.848
I lost my job...

01:01:30.167 --> 01:01:33.467
Hey Piku...your 'Paanchu
babu...!' (cry baby)

01:01:33.667 --> 01:01:35.474
What's that?

01:01:38.667 --> 01:01:39.893
Nothing...

01:01:41.542 --> 01:01:46.478
...I mean if you know you were
right then why that sullen face...?

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.307
All honest men in the world
have faced similar consequences...

01:01:52.875 --> 01:01:59.972
...well neither will you gain
my sympathy nor try to gain Piku's...

01:02:03.917 --> 01:02:06.975
so you came back...?

01:02:08.875 --> 01:02:12.013
Ya...and handling this
taxi business since then...

01:02:25.292 --> 01:02:28.760
yes Srivastav..she's checking...

01:02:30.625 --> 01:02:31.842
130/90

01:02:32.042 --> 01:02:34.224
yes 130!90..

01:02:34.667 --> 01:02:37.759
...yes I have Crateagus...fine then...

01:02:38.167 --> 01:02:40.599
...hey Budhan get me Crateagus..

01:02:42.792 --> 01:02:44.717
Taansen sang 'Raaga Deepak'...

01:02:44.917 --> 01:02:46.769
...all the lamps lit up...

01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:50.050
...he sang 'Raga Malhaar'..

01:02:50.250 --> 01:02:51.592
...well it rained...

01:02:51.792 --> 01:02:59.390
<i>so</i> why didn't anyone sing 'Raga Motion'...
you would've been relieved by now...

01:03:00.542 --> 01:03:02.895
Like Raga motion

01:03:03.875 --> 01:03:05.101
What do you say?

01:03:05.917 --> 01:03:08.800
Here's what I have...Indian
Basil and mint leaves..

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.013
...boil them in water
and drink it...you'll be fine...

01:03:12.250 --> 01:03:13.217
How do you know ...?

01:03:13.417 --> 01:03:14.217
Will you boil these
or should I throw them...?

01:03:14.417 --> 01:03:18.852
No wait...Budhan...get
this done for me...

01:03:19.167 --> 01:03:22.385
Trust me...whatever is inside,
it'll come out...

01:03:22.750 --> 01:03:24.636
Okay... fine

01:03:31.625 --> 01:03:37.516
Tell me one thing...is this the only topic
that you both discuss...the whole day?

01:03:38.250 --> 01:03:39.385
Yeah..

01:03:43.417 --> 01:03:46.270
I should've found out before
taking the booking...well...

01:04:18.542 --> 01:04:22.351
Prayers to the God
at 5am and check out at 8..

01:04:23.042 --> 01:04:24.925
Lakhan take them
to room number 112

01:04:25.125 --> 01:04:27.467
Budhan keep the medicines ready...

01:04:27.667 --> 01:04:29.269
...I'll see you in a bit Dad..

01:04:29.542 --> 01:04:30.723
Piku...where...?

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.101
I'm coming...

01:04:54.042 --> 01:04:57.021
This place is famous
for its desserts...

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.511
...would you like to have some?

01:05:01.542 --> 01:05:02.894
Am I disturbing you...?

01:05:04.917 --> 01:05:06.592
Can we sit quietly please...?

01:05:06.792 --> 01:05:08.098
Ya sure..

01:05:15.250 --> 01:05:17.136
You were calling someone scheming...?

01:05:17.792 --> 01:05:18.973
Not you..

01:05:19.417 --> 01:05:21.144
Better not!

01:05:21.917 --> 01:05:23.894
I would've thrown
you out of the car..

01:05:26.167 --> 01:05:27.644
How would your Dad have
gone to Kolkata then?

01:05:28.125 --> 01:05:29.592
I would've driven...

01:05:29.792 --> 01:05:32.884
really?...
well...had I known this earlier,

01:05:33.292 --> 01:05:35.474
I could've stretched for a bit...

01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:39.886
...now you drive tomorrow...

01:05:41.042 --> 01:05:42.217
I don't like driving...

01:05:42.417 --> 01:05:46.800
why...? as in? women in
Saudi are fighting with the govt.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.013
For their driving rights...
getting jailed too for same...

01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:51.925
...and you say you don't
like driving...that's weird..

01:05:52.125 --> 01:05:54.057
Not really-..those
countries are like that...

01:05:57.042 --> 01:06:00.260
...moreover...driving
liberates a woman...

01:06:05.542 --> 01:06:09.761
Are you saying all this to impress
me or you really do respect women?

01:06:10.292 --> 01:06:12.645
Isn't it written on my face?

01:06:14.375 --> 01:06:22.348
Well...You were arguing
with some Ritu this morning...

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.261
My sister..

01:06:25.667 --> 01:06:28.270
And my mother,
another devious woman...

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.968
...I swear...you can ask Syed...

01:06:33.917 --> 01:06:37.885
Yes Dad..ok I'll be there

01:06:40.042 --> 01:06:45.842
tell me something...you're
really his daughter...

01:06:46.042 --> 01:06:46.893
...I mean...

01:06:47.542 --> 01:06:48.848
yes...I am 'his' daughter

01:06:49.292 --> 01:06:53.342
...and ten times more strange..
weird..irritating..annoying

01:06:53.542 --> 01:06:55.300
No no no ...I didn't
mean that way...

01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:58.012
No I know what you mean...l
know its weird its okay...

01:06:59.417 --> 01:07:02.509
...but I am like that...

01:07:09.042 --> 01:07:10.675
<i>Hello..hello</i>

01:07:10.875 --> 01:07:12.511
There's no room that's vacant

01:07:12.917 --> 01:07:14.894
Excuse me...room...I need a room...

01:07:15.417 --> 01:07:16.050
all occupied

01:07:16.250 --> 01:07:18.592
that Bengali family that's just walked in
...I am part of that...excuse me...

01:07:18.792 --> 01:07:20.769
Not here...go...

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:27.011
Which room number is
that Bengali family in...?

01:07:31.792 --> 01:07:33.394
Piku..

01:07:35.542 --> 01:07:37.925
There aren't any rooms available
...apparently a lot of tourist..

01:07:38.125 --> 01:07:39.467
I know.. Budhan is
also sleeping in the car..

01:07:39.667 --> 01:07:43.635
Hey listen I am the owner...not your
driver that I go and sleep next to him

01:07:43.875 --> 01:07:45.092
That dormitory is
infested with mosquitoes...

01:07:45.292 --> 01:07:48.145
Its midnight
already...just go please...

01:07:48.667 --> 01:07:52.592
I am not sleeping outside..

01:07:52.792 --> 01:07:54.342
Is this the only hotel in Banaras...?

01:07:54.542 --> 01:07:57.270
Piku..

01:08:01.917 --> 01:08:05.760
You're behaving as if I am
barging in your personal bedroom...

01:08:08.417 --> 01:08:09.973
...fine...

01:08:10.292 --> 01:08:15.467
...I'll leave but this
is not...I am taking the car...

01:08:15.667 --> 01:08:17.466
...your luggage is there...and
your father's throne as well...

01:08:17.667 --> 01:08:19.019
...ok tata bye bye..

01:08:19.917 --> 01:08:21.644
What time will you
be here in the morning...?

01:08:22.625 --> 01:08:25.763
Have no idea...not sure
if I'll come at all...

01:08:31.542 --> 01:08:33.098
listen

01:08:39.750 --> 01:08:40.725
Say...

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.477
...sleep here..

01:08:44.667 --> 01:08:46.724
See that's what I was saying..

01:08:48.917 --> 01:08:50.894
But on a chair...?

01:08:59.667 --> 01:09:01.895
Shhh! Now what is it?

01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:03.425
Switch off the light

01:09:03.625 --> 01:09:05.227
Can I change?

01:09:06.042 --> 01:09:07.216
Can you not make any sound...

01:09:07.417 --> 01:09:08.643
right..

01:09:21.625 --> 01:09:23.978
That basil water did nothing...

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.013
Sir do you sit Indian
style or western style...?

01:09:31.042 --> 01:09:35.466
Do you sit Indian
style or western...?

01:09:35.667 --> 01:09:36.425
Huh? What do you mean?

01:09:36.625 --> 01:09:38.636
There aren't any toilets
with Indian style these days..

01:09:39.167 --> 01:09:41.019
That's the issue...

01:09:41.292 --> 01:09:45.716
...it's the most scientific
way for excretion...

01:09:45.917 --> 01:09:48.466
...Rana..please..stop
this nonsense discussion..

01:09:48.667 --> 01:09:49.675
No no its not Nonsense..

01:09:49.875 --> 01:09:54.467
...did our fore fathers ever
have this constipation problem...

01:09:54.667 --> 01:09:57.592
just try and remember...no...
never...isn't it...?

01:09:57.792 --> 01:09:58.717
Naa..I didn't get you...

01:09:58.917 --> 01:10:03.050
This constipation problem wasn't
there in olden days...isn't it?

01:10:03.250 --> 01:10:04.217
Right..

01:10:04.417 --> 01:10:06.849
Sir let me explain you,
it's a very simple formula...!

01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:08.217
Now this is our stomach..

01:10:08.417 --> 01:10:08.842
Ya..

01:10:09.042 --> 01:10:12.760
...our intestines
go like this...see...

01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:16.467
...this is our stomach...this
turns here...

01:10:16.667 --> 01:10:19.145
...and after that...makes
this question mark kind of thing...

01:10:19.375 --> 01:10:24.390
...and when we...one minute...

01:10:25.667 --> 01:10:30.261
...sit like this...it
puts pressure on our stomach...

01:10:31.375 --> 01:10:32.800
...and intestines get pressed...

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:39.972
...and whatever waste material is there
in the pipeline that slowly comes out".

01:10:42.792 --> 01:10:44.644
...no need to put pressure...it
happens on its own...

01:10:45.042 --> 01:10:45.768
are you a doctor?

01:10:46.167 --> 01:10:47.592
And aren't we getting late now?

01:10:47.792 --> 01:10:49.175
Can't leave him like this...can we?

01:10:49.375 --> 01:10:50.727
Sir...should we try again?

01:10:51.292 --> 01:10:54.092
Where...here? What if I fall down?

01:10:54.292 --> 01:10:55.467
I want to reach Kolkata safely..

01:10:55.667 --> 01:10:58.217
Dad has arthritis...he
cannot do this stunts..

01:10:58.417 --> 01:11:00.269
Budhan will help

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.217
I can also...come inside

01:11:02.417 --> 01:11:02.967
Na..na..I will try..

01:11:03.167 --> 01:11:06.050
Dad..what's wrong with you?
You cannot..climb this...!

01:11:06.250 --> 01:11:10.217
This is western style,
how will I squat on it...?

01:11:10.417 --> 01:11:11.342
Let me help you...

01:11:11.542 --> 01:11:12.592
Dad what if you fall...?

01:11:12.792 --> 01:11:14.800
Wait...wait...hey Budhan..

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.467
Yes..
- Come here...

01:11:16.667 --> 01:11:19.550
Fine...when you're done
with this circus...call me...

01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:20.425
Sir let her go...

01:11:20.625 --> 01:11:21.550
We will try

01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:23.352
Please hold my hands

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.263
Hey go away you both...l
need to take off my night pants...

01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:32.092
Should I also...?

01:11:32.292 --> 01:11:33.393
Yes...go...

01:11:33.667 --> 01:11:34.842
Will you manage to...

01:11:35.042 --> 01:11:35.643
Absolutely

01:11:40.167 --> 01:11:41.217
Done?

01:11:41.417 --> 01:11:46.478
...not satisfactorily...but
at least got something new to try..

01:11:53.292 --> 01:11:57.101
Don't think you can impress
him or me with your home remedies...

01:12:00.375 --> 01:12:02.175
...we know everything
about constipation..

01:12:02.375 --> 01:12:03.476
Ohh yeah obviously...

01:12:09.792 --> 01:12:14.261
Grand Pa's been lying still for a while...

01:12:14.792 --> 01:12:15.893
Should I check him?

01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:18.637
Keep quiet! He's resting...

01:12:19.125 --> 01:12:20.800
There's no better place
then Banaras for last rites...

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.217
Shut up.

01:12:22.417 --> 01:12:24.895
Just check on him...we
can still get back to Banaras

01:12:33.542 --> 01:12:37.092
Hey..why are you...?
And why are you speeding...?

01:12:37.292 --> 01:12:38.092
I am not..

01:12:38.292 --> 01:12:40.175
Look in front...look
in front...oh god...

01:12:40.375 --> 01:12:42.967
Relax and sing that
path song you sang earlier...

01:12:43.167 --> 01:12:43.800
you should be there

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.717
...let him drive...we're
paying you to drive not sit...

01:12:47.917 --> 01:12:48.800
She's driving fine...

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:49.800
I know how to drive...

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.175
Piku you've never
driven on a highway...

01:12:52.375 --> 01:12:53.675
This is how accidents
happen Dad... Keep..

01:12:53.875 --> 01:12:54.217
Keep quiet...

01:12:54.417 --> 01:12:55.592
But what if she bangs...

01:12:55.792 --> 01:12:59.092
I don't want to come under
a truck like a dog or a cat..

01:12:59.292 --> 01:13:00.842
...I don't like unnatural deaths..

01:13:01.042 --> 01:13:03.975
Stop stop stop the car..

01:13:04.542 --> 01:13:06.599
Slow..slow..

01:13:09.792 --> 01:13:10.643
Hey“

01:13:15.250 --> 01:13:17.261
It doesn't matter what
you like or what you don't...

01:13:17.542 --> 01:13:19.050
...whenever its time...you'll die...

01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:21.353
...on a road...in a hospital...

01:13:23.667 --> 01:13:27.967
...death and shit... come
unannounced...anytime... anywhere...

01:13:28.167 --> 01:13:29.644
I disagree!

01:13:30.125 --> 01:13:31.135
Gem...

01:13:44.292 --> 01:13:51.139
Do you know patience
is a must for a good driver...

01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:52.635
...I was testing..

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.889
...that's all...come...come..

01:13:59.542 --> 01:14:00.768
Lets go..

01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:20.261
Who all stay in Kolkata...?

01:14:21.292 --> 01:14:22.974
Uncle...aunt...

01:14:25.792 --> 01:14:28.645
...actually my mother, dad and I...
we used to stay there earlier

01:14:29.042 --> 01:14:31.770
In any case one leg of
Bengalis is always in Kolkata...

01:14:32.042 --> 01:14:36.842
...yeah but I mean...I feel
totally at home in Delhi also...

01:14:37.042 --> 01:14:40.467
Ya but one does have connections
with the place one belongs to...

01:14:40.667 --> 01:14:42.092
Correct...Correct

01:14:42.292 --> 01:14:43.925
But there is nothing for me Baba...

01:14:44.125 --> 01:14:47.342
...few relatives...I have no connection
with them...and that house

01:14:47.542 --> 01:14:50.634
Which you want to sell off
but I won't let you...

01:14:50.875 --> 01:14:52.852
Are you going to
sell off your home ...?

01:14:55.625 --> 01:14:57.011
Don't know...

01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:41.092
Hey Budhan...where
did it's cell go...?

01:15:41.292 --> 01:15:41.967
Cell...

01:15:42.167 --> 01:15:43.467
I gave it to you...

01:15:43.667 --> 01:15:47.010
No, it was in your hand when we stopped
at that roadside place for dinner...

01:15:47.417 --> 01:15:48.427
ls it...?

01:15:50.250 --> 01:15:51.977
Turn back the car...turn back...

01:15:52.542 --> 01:15:53.473
What...?

01:15:53.917 --> 01:15:55.092
Turn back the car...

01:15:55.292 --> 01:15:55.967
What...?

01:15:56.167 --> 01:15:58.800
My ear plug cell has gone weak...

01:15:59.000 --> 01:15:59.967
...I think I've left it
behind where we'd stopped...

01:16:00.167 --> 01:16:02.342
...hey why are you still
driving ...u turn u turn...

01:16:02.542 --> 01:16:04.467
We'll be in Kolkata in a bit...

01:16:04.667 --> 01:16:06.717
Nobody is talking to you mister...

01:16:06.917 --> 01:16:08.300
...do <i>as</i> I say ...u turn...

01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:10.967
Dad...I am sure you have enough
battery that can last you till there...

01:16:11.167 --> 01:16:12.428
...we can't <i>waste</i>
time unnecessarily

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.386
Oh Unnecessary...

01:16:16.042 --> 01:16:19.717
...this ear whistles
due to weak battery...

01:16:19.917 --> 01:16:21.675
...strange sounds
come out of here...

01:16:21.875 --> 01:16:23.352
...is it unnecessary?

01:16:24.792 --> 01:16:27.967
Why do you think
lam a burden on you...

01:16:28.167 --> 01:16:28.842
lam not a burden...!

01:16:29.042 --> 01:16:31.592
Look...I can do everything
on my own...alright...?

01:16:31.792 --> 01:16:32.592
Oh...Dad...please...you...

01:16:32.792 --> 01:16:35.270
Na Na...you be quiet...!

01:16:35.917 --> 01:16:38.967
And you ...you are charging us...

01:16:39.167 --> 01:16:41.092
...if you don't listen to me...

01:16:41.292 --> 01:16:43.092
...I won't care whether
you're an owner or a driver...

01:16:43.292 --> 01:16:44.644
...I can take bus also...

01:16:45.917 --> 01:16:49.851
I am fit...I am not dependent
on any body ...no body...

01:16:50.917 --> 01:16:52.769
Unnecessary!

01:16:53.417 --> 01:16:54.894
Why have you stopped here...?

01:16:55.292 --> 01:16:56.842
Fine...you can take the bus...

01:16:57.042 --> 01:16:59.217
...stopping every now and then...bloody...
even my patience is running out...

01:16:59.417 --> 01:17:00.092
Please mind your language...

01:17:00.292 --> 01:17:01.550
No I have not said anything wrong...

01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:03.511
...and what's with
this burden thing...?

01:17:03.792 --> 01:17:06.884
Wonder why parents feel satisfied in
emotionally blackmailing their kids...

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:10.342
...if you were a burden ...you
would've been sitting in Delhi..

01:17:10.542 --> 01:17:12.269
...she wouldn't have cared to
take you all the way to Kolkata...

01:17:14.417 --> 01:17:16.550
...so close your eyes
and sit quiet for sometime...

01:17:16.750 --> 01:17:19.603
Sky won't fall if you don't hear
some words

01:17:22.917 --> 01:17:26.385
if we keep going like this,
we will take forever to reach...

01:17:30.875 --> 01:17:32.136
Ok shall we...?

01:17:38.125 --> 01:17:42.765
But...what if on the way I
feel like passing motion...then...?

01:17:48.167 --> 01:17:49.842
I'll stop the car...

01:17:50.042 --> 01:17:52.717
...keep your throne on
the other side of the road...

01:17:52.917 --> 01:17:54.473
...you can do what you need to...

01:17:56.250 --> 01:17:57.260
alright...?

01:17:58.042 --> 01:17:59.018
Good

01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:02.476
Alright

01:18:35.167 --> 01:18:36.769
Two hours more...

01:18:49.167 --> 01:18:49.768
Sorry

01:18:50.250 --> 01:18:51.135
Sleep...

01:18:52.792 --> 01:18:53.643
Sure?

01:18:54.792 --> 01:18:57.395
Will wake you up once we're there...

01:18:58.875 --> 01:18:59.851
Thank you

01:19:42.667 --> 01:19:46.726
Didi, they've arrived...

01:19:47.250 --> 01:19:48.175

Brother!...come...come...

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.217

01:19:51.417 --> 01:19:52.769
Come come come...all ok...?

01:19:53.292 --> 01:19:54.848
Uncle you've lost weight...

01:19:55.417 --> 01:19:58.760
Champa kunj...here I am...!

01:19:59.042 --> 01:20:00.675
No no...whole night
we were just awake...

01:20:00.875 --> 01:20:01.967
Brother...you must be very tired...?

01:20:02.167 --> 01:20:03.217
lam fine...

01:20:03.417 --> 01:20:04.643
Get the luggage

01:20:05.042 --> 01:20:06.092
Nothing's changed here...

01:20:06.292 --> 01:20:07.342
And whose idea was
it to do this road journey?

01:20:07.542 --> 01:20:10.100
Goshh! you need
a heart to do that...

01:20:12.042 --> 01:20:14.300
Rana...come...Kaku
he's Rana Choudhry...

01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:15.842
Greetings...Mr Choudhry...
please sit...

01:20:16.042 --> 01:20:19.225
Hey Binod, he's not Bengali...

01:20:20.417 --> 01:20:22.425
He's the owner of Himachal
Tourist Taxi stand...

01:20:22.625 --> 01:20:23.717
...his driver didn't
come so he drove us...

01:20:23.917 --> 01:20:28.592
Oh...that means Delhi people aren't
as bad as we think them to be here...

01:20:28.792 --> 01:20:29.717
Please don't mind...

01:20:29.917 --> 01:20:33.260
Not her fault...well that is the
perception about Delhi people...

01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:35.227
so...Piku...

01:20:35.792 --> 01:20:36.967
...get that chair
in...I'll have to leave...

01:20:37.167 --> 01:20:38.393
Where?

01:20:38.667 --> 01:20:42.967
Where...you can't be going
back to Delhi right now...

01:20:43.167 --> 01:20:44.342
...go tomorrow morning...

01:20:44.542 --> 01:20:45.717
No its fine...really...I'll leave...

01:20:45.917 --> 01:20:47.269
No one asked you...

01:20:47.625 --> 01:20:48.300
Budhan...

01:20:48.500 --> 01:20:49.092
<i>Yes</i>

01:20:49.292 --> 01:20:50.300
Where have you kept my luggage...?

01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:52.227
In that room down there...

01:20:52.625 --> 01:20:56.389
No...keep it up
stairs...in that room...

01:21:33.292 --> 01:21:35.300
"Where did that chair come from?"

01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:37.217
That's grand pa's commode...

01:21:37.417 --> 01:21:41.511
...don't touch it...haven't
cleaned it with an ANTISEPTIC yet..."

01:21:51.417 --> 01:21:55.092
the whole feel of this house has
changed...because brother's here...

01:21:55.292 --> 01:21:57.144
ya...but Piku...

01:21:57.417 --> 01:21:59.474
...don't know what
she has grown up to be...

01:22:00.542 --> 01:22:04.675
...first she <i>stays</i> with
her aunt Chhobi ...plus single...

01:22:04.875 --> 01:22:05.717
...living in Delhi...

01:22:05.917 --> 01:22:07.644
Hello...yes Nobendu...right...

01:22:08.792 --> 01:22:11.270
...he has not told
me anything...why...

01:22:13.042 --> 01:22:14.223
...oh...ok...

01:22:14.750 --> 01:22:15.467
What happened?

01:22:15.667 --> 01:22:19.635
Nobendu is saying...brother
has come to fix the house deal...

01:22:20.042 --> 01:22:21.348
I am not surprised.

01:22:21.917 --> 01:22:24.592
Must've done sitting in Delhi...

01:22:24.792 --> 01:22:25.768
It can't be true...

01:22:26.042 --> 01:22:28.967
I warned you...but
you shouted at me...

01:22:29.167 --> 01:22:30.092
...now see for yourself...

01:22:30.292 --> 01:22:34.056
...you respect him so much
but for him we are nobody...huh...

01:22:41.375 --> 01:22:44.300
How's Dr Shrivastava?
He will miss you

01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:45.425
I don't think so...

01:22:45.625 --> 01:22:48.050
...Dad just forces
him to come everyday...

01:22:48.250 --> 01:22:49.467
...I never force anybody, never.

01:22:49.667 --> 01:22:52.592
There...Mr. Choudhary...join us

01:22:52.792 --> 01:22:54.394
Pass me some pepper Piku...

01:22:55.792 --> 01:22:58.550
I had no idea that your bowel
problem had become so chronic?

01:22:58.750 --> 01:23:01.763
I don't think it's in our family...

01:23:02.292 --> 01:23:03.143
Of course it is!

01:23:04.042 --> 01:23:04.717
Our father had it!

01:23:04.917 --> 01:23:05.717
But how would you remember...

01:23:05.917 --> 01:23:09.092
...you were busy in fooling around
with life...fun...women.. all that.

01:23:09.292 --> 01:23:13.135
Were the elders just watching
the show if he was fooling around...?

01:23:13.625 --> 01:23:17.842
...and when sister in law and almost decided
to get him married to her sister Chhobi,

01:23:18.042 --> 01:23:19.842
...then what was the
need to come and see me...?

01:23:20.042 --> 01:23:24.887
Next day I had my M.Com exam...
final paper...but no one cared!

01:23:25.917 --> 01:23:27.925
Mom just expressed
it to grandma that...

01:23:28.125 --> 01:23:31.717
...its fun if two brother's
are married to two sisters...

01:23:31.917 --> 01:23:33.467
...but its not that she
didn't love you when you came...

01:23:33.667 --> 01:23:36.885
You were not even born
then Piku...how would you know

01:23:38.917 --> 01:23:41.300
All I know is when mom
was in the hospital...she said...

01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:43.592
...whenever I would get married,
you'll do the rituals on her behalf...

01:23:43.792 --> 01:23:45.474
...not aunt Chhobi...

01:23:45.875 --> 01:23:47.886
After mom, you are
like a mother to me

01:23:48.125 --> 01:23:52.842
Why dig the old graves...she's come
here after so many years

01:23:53.042 --> 01:23:53.717
But what did I say...

01:23:53.917 --> 01:23:57.717
No no ...don't stop
her...she's right...

01:23:57.917 --> 01:24:02.467
...this frustration
is not right...it causes...

01:24:02.667 --> 01:24:03.217
Negativity

01:24:03.417 --> 01:24:11.467
right...negativity...and
that causes indigestion and then...

01:24:11.667 --> 01:24:12.768
Constipation...?

01:24:13.167 --> 01:24:16.385
Amazing! How do you connect
everything with the stomach?

01:24:16.917 --> 01:24:18.592
Coz everything is
connected to the stomach!

01:24:18.792 --> 01:24:22.467
A person's emotion
depends on his motion...

01:24:22.667 --> 01:24:25.270
This is all your nonsense
theory...in your own head...

01:24:25.542 --> 01:24:27.092
...it's not that your
constipated all the time...?

01:24:27.292 --> 01:24:28.342
Why're you getting angry with me...?

01:24:28.542 --> 01:24:29.967
lam not getting angry...

01:24:30.167 --> 01:24:33.592
...but you don't discuss
anything other than this Dad...

01:24:33.792 --> 01:24:34.550
...there's a limit...

01:24:34.750 --> 01:24:35.800
Just relax brother...

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:36.885
I am relaxed

01:24:37.125 --> 01:24:38.342
And you don't talk much...!

01:24:38.542 --> 01:24:42.717
Do you know Piku...for how
long your uncle sits on the pot...?

01:24:42.917 --> 01:24:44.300
What do you mean...

01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:46.717
...father had
constipation...brother has...

01:24:46.917 --> 01:24:49.217
...and you also have the same
...its in the family...

01:24:49.417 --> 01:24:49.925
No brother...

01:24:50.125 --> 01:24:51.592
Yes father had...

01:24:51.792 --> 01:24:52.723
No...

01:24:53.667 --> 01:24:55.717
You had constipation.

01:24:55.917 --> 01:24:57.269
Why are you looking at me?

01:24:58.917 --> 01:25:01.342
...Uncle you know about
the water shortage in Delhi...

01:25:01.542 --> 01:25:03.842
...still he wants a bucket
full of water...

01:25:04.042 --> 01:25:06.217
...because he's not satisfied
with that jet spray...

01:25:06.417 --> 01:25:10.967
No that's because that jet has a sharp
flow of water...it hurts me here...

01:25:11.167 --> 01:25:14.100
And in winters he
demands hot water...

01:25:14.417 --> 01:25:17.976
...now tell me who needs hot
water to clean his...back side?

01:25:21.125 --> 01:25:24.342
You must know that every third person
in America has the same problem...

01:25:24.542 --> 01:25:26.717
...in fact constipation
is their biggest health issue...

01:25:26.917 --> 01:25:28.092
Really?
- Of course!

01:25:28.292 --> 01:25:29.717
...still they live care free...

01:25:29.917 --> 01:25:31.769
...looking at their faces can you ever
tell what's going on inside them...?

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.842
Who cares? They're the
biggest economy in the world

01:25:34.042 --> 01:25:34.927
No no...I care...

01:25:38.917 --> 01:25:41.925
How can you call yourself
normal so confidently...

01:25:42.125 --> 01:25:44.800
Hear me out...for any normal person,
a breakfast,

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:45.842
...a lunch and a dinner...

01:25:46.042 --> 01:25:49.675
...these three meals is all that is needed
to smoothly do the job next morning...

01:25:49.875 --> 01:25:53.675
...but they...on an average
go once in three days!

01:25:53.875 --> 01:25:56.092
All through the day
they just eat junk...

01:25:56.292 --> 01:25:57.592
...collecting inside
as if a fixed deposit...

01:25:57.792 --> 01:25:58.592
...and then one day they
go...and well...do it...

01:25:58.792 --> 01:25:59.723
Chchii!!

01:26:00.667 --> 01:26:02.599
No no seriously...don't laugh...

01:26:03.167 --> 01:26:05.270
and your condition isn't that bad...

01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:13.894
...do one thing..-just chew
your food like this...like a cow".

01:26:14.292 --> 01:26:17.271
...next day you're bound
to have a clear motion...

01:26:17.792 --> 01:26:20.145
cow?

01:26:21.417 --> 01:26:24.467
Mr. Banerjee have you ever heard a
cow or a buffalo ever getting constipated...

01:26:24.667 --> 01:26:28.226
...or doing a hard cow dung...or
loose...think about it...

01:26:30.375 --> 01:26:31.727
Tell me

01:26:34.875 --> 01:26:36.675
Right...his logic is right

01:26:36.875 --> 01:26:38.511
Are you sure you are not a Bengali?

01:26:38.750 --> 01:26:40.853
Sir not everything is
a copyright by Bengalis...

01:26:42.042 --> 01:26:44.019
You didn't know this...?

01:26:44.792 --> 01:26:45.768
No.

01:26:50.125 --> 01:26:51.550
There was a railing there?

01:26:51.750 --> 01:26:52.467
I think...ya...

01:26:52.667 --> 01:26:54.644
That was a new
construction...needs repair

01:26:54.917 --> 01:26:55.675
Will get it done...

01:26:55.875 --> 01:26:58.763
You're family is
quite interesting...

01:27:00.042 --> 01:27:04.010
just because everyone laughed,
don't think everyone is impressed...

01:27:04.292 --> 01:27:05.518
...we are very critical people...

01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:10.014
Oh I know...some people just
can't like anyone...it's Ok...

01:27:10.667 --> 01:27:11.768
you think I am like that...?

01:27:12.292 --> 01:27:14.092
You are...but...can't
blame you for it...

01:27:14.292 --> 01:27:16.925
...actually after a certain
age...one becomes like that...

01:27:17.125 --> 01:27:18.050
...difficult to please...

01:27:18.250 --> 01:27:20.512
Then don't try to...'please'

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:21.885
Ok...

01:27:22.292 --> 01:27:23.518
Do you know Piku...

01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:29.721
Binod was in secondary when our
father started building this house...

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.717
And same year brother
also got a job in ITC...

01:27:32.917 --> 01:27:35.717
37, Virginia house,
CHOWRANGEE LANE...

01:27:35.917 --> 01:27:37.473
You remember...?

01:27:38.667 --> 01:27:40.217
Earlier we just had ground floor...

01:27:40.417 --> 01:27:42.842
...when they shifted here,
that's when this 1st floor was made...

01:27:43.042 --> 01:27:45.520
Ok listen...my head...

01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:50.352
Can we go out somewhere“?

01:27:54.292 --> 01:27:56.717
Ya...I'll just give
dad his medicines...

01:27:56.917 --> 01:27:59.896
...the centre of my circumference...

01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:03.550
...I feel is this
place...this courtyard...

01:28:03.750 --> 01:28:06.342
Then after retirement why
did you settle down in Delhi...?

01:28:06.542 --> 01:28:09.550
You knew your brother doesn't
earn <i>as</i> much as you did...

01:28:09.750 --> 01:28:10.967
...to maintain this house...

01:28:11.167 --> 01:28:11.967
Can you keep quiet?

01:28:12.167 --> 01:28:12.717
Why should I?

01:28:12.917 --> 01:28:15.395
No no...carry on...she's right..

01:28:15.667 --> 01:28:19.592
...a woman as educated <i>as</i> her should
not be stopped from speaking her mind...

01:28:19.792 --> 01:28:20.800
...but tell me Moni...

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:26.092
...in 1979 who wrote that job application
for you in that BATA company...?

01:28:26.292 --> 01:28:29.550
I had my connections there...still
you didn't take up that job...why?

01:28:29.750 --> 01:28:32.050
...because then my salary
would've been more than his...

01:28:32.250 --> 01:28:34.342
That's exactly what
I call a low IQ thinking...

01:28:34.542 --> 01:28:36.592
...you yourself are responsible
for your frustrations...

01:28:36.792 --> 01:28:42.387
...no one else...anyways...such
old memories coming back...

01:28:43.792 --> 01:28:45.717
remember Binod...after
mother passed away,

01:28:45.917 --> 01:28:51.854
her body was kept here...head
that side...legs here...

01:28:52.292 --> 01:28:55.635
And then Piku's mother's
body...that too...

01:29:02.917 --> 01:29:04.269
Piku lets go

01:29:05.917 --> 01:29:06.467
Where...?

01:29:06.667 --> 01:29:08.342
We'll just go out...just...

01:29:08.542 --> 01:29:09.393
But where?

01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:11.136
Kolkata tour

01:29:11.542 --> 01:29:13.895
Hey Piku...Don't be late...

01:29:14.292 --> 01:29:15.598
Ya I'll come soon...

01:29:18.917 --> 01:29:20.678
If you're <i>so</i> emotionally
attached to this place...

01:29:24.042 --> 01:29:26.600
What? Have you lost it?

01:29:26.875 --> 01:29:28.592
Brick by brick I've
constructed this house...

01:29:28.792 --> 01:29:32.260
CHAMPA KUNJ can't be sold
ever...it will never be sold!

01:29:33.417 --> 01:29:34.717
Our mother's name...CHAMPA...
that's written on it...Got it?!

01:29:34.917 --> 01:29:35.677
But brother...

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.056
Take a right from here

01:29:56.417 --> 01:30:00.886
Mom used to teach here...then
she met Dad and got married...

01:30:01.292 --> 01:30:02.268
And left the job?

01:30:03.542 --> 01:30:04.723
Yes

01:30:15.417 --> 01:30:17.645
...why don't you
elope and get married...

01:30:18.417 --> 01:30:20.019
he's not that bad...

01:30:20.625 --> 01:30:23.137
...moreover you need
someone to run away with...

01:30:25.792 --> 01:30:27.018
...why didn't you marry...?

01:30:29.667 --> 01:30:31.800
Next stop coffee shop
hhuuhh and then by the Ganges

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.602
Okay

01:30:36.417 --> 01:30:39.509
There used to be a theater
here...and now a building...

01:30:39.792 --> 01:30:40.842
That's what happens usually...

01:30:41.042 --> 01:30:42.467
...don't you want
to sell off your house?

01:30:42.667 --> 01:30:44.144
One day a building
will come up there too...

01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:46.852
I am just being practical...

01:30:47.167 --> 01:30:49.520
No no I am not saying
you're wrong...

01:30:51.042 --> 01:30:52.553
...may be this is the way forward...

01:30:56.167 --> 01:30:59.259
...but if you pull your roots out...

01:30:59.917 --> 01:31:01.519
...what will remain...

01:31:01.875 --> 01:31:03.511
...you know what I mean...

01:31:26.292 --> 01:31:29.225
Yes Dad...Crataegus

01:31:30.167 --> 01:31:35.512
Carbo veg...6-7
drops...yes I am coming.

01:31:37.542 --> 01:31:39.645
You guys must not be
having any medical expenses...

01:31:39.917 --> 01:31:42.020
...looks like you manage
your own treatment...

01:31:42.750 --> 01:31:43.760
Ya...

01:31:44.292 --> 01:31:47.635
How old is you father...must
be at least 70?

01:31:48.542 --> 01:31:49.518
Hmm exact

01:31:49.792 --> 01:31:51.842
And the way you're being his doctor,

01:31:52.042 --> 01:31:55.601
he'll be around for another 20
more years...which makes him 90.

01:31:56.417 --> 01:31:57.092
Touchwood...

01:31:57.292 --> 01:32:03.138
And in next 20 years, you too
will become 50...approximately?

01:32:06.500 --> 01:32:07.635
Hmm?
<i>'</i> 30...?

01:32:08.292 --> 01:32:11.145
50...in just taking
care of your father?

01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:14.513
One minute...why are
you saying all this...

01:32:15.042 --> 01:32:15.967
...you know my situation...?

01:32:16.167 --> 01:32:17.467
You know he's dependent on me?

01:32:17.667 --> 01:32:21.467
Can't hear or see
properly...should I leave him?

01:32:21.667 --> 01:32:22.092
No no...

01:32:22.292 --> 01:32:23.342
How will he manage on his own?

01:32:23.542 --> 01:32:26.600
I am not asking you to leave him..
even I haven't left my mother...

01:32:27.042 --> 01:32:31.842
...I am just saying I hope
you realize he is a selfish man...

01:32:32.042 --> 01:32:32.592
...no he's not...

01:32:32.792 --> 01:32:33.893
Ya he is

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.262
and even if he is
...he's my father...

01:32:37.667 --> 01:32:39.895
If he's your father then
why do behave like his mother?

01:32:41.250 --> 01:32:44.513
Because Rana, after a certain
age parents can't live on their own,

01:32:44.917 --> 01:32:47.145
...they need to be kept alive...

01:32:47.375 --> 01:32:49.136
...and that responsibility
is of kids only...

01:32:53.292 --> 01:32:54.800
...so if someone
wants to marry me...

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.717
He'll have to adopt
your 90 year old kid too...?

01:32:56.917 --> 01:32:58.269
Of course...

01:33:03.375 --> 01:33:05.102
...will you marry me?

01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:11.136
I haven't gone mad...

01:33:12.542 --> 01:33:14.144
Then don't worry about me...

01:33:14.417 --> 01:33:16.349
No no I am not worrying

01:33:16.917 --> 01:33:21.842
dad used to take us there...to show steamers
...there can you see...there...?

01:33:22.042 --> 01:33:25.925
Please come down,
Aunt Chhobi is here...

01:33:26.125 --> 01:33:32.050

01:33:32.250 --> 01:33:33.467

01:33:34.667 --> 01:33:35.342

01:33:35.542 --> 01:33:36.175
Surprise...well...

01:33:36.375 --> 01:33:37.175
Where's Piku?

01:33:37.375 --> 01:33:38.385
Piku's gone out...

01:33:39.417 --> 01:33:40.092
Aunty...

01:33:40.292 --> 01:33:42.550
Your uncle suddenly
made a plan for Darjeeling,

01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:46.967
...so I thought I'll meet you
all on the way...now come fast..

01:33:47.167 --> 01:33:48.769
Ok ok

01:34:00.792 --> 01:34:02.895
Thank you dear...cheers!

01:34:03.292 --> 01:34:06.145
Bhaku da...hey Bhaku da

01:34:06.542 --> 01:34:09.976
What is it...why is your mood off?
Now you're in Kolkata...

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.550
no...I am thinking...

01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:17.842
about Piku? No point...that
Sourobh is already married now...

01:34:18.042 --> 01:34:21.717
...you didn't like him...so what's
the need of this 'thinking' now...?

01:34:21.917 --> 01:34:25.050
lam thinking...when
will you spare me...

01:34:25.250 --> 01:34:26.050
as in...?

01:34:26.250 --> 01:34:28.592
I can't believe...you've
come here too...

01:34:28.792 --> 01:34:31.600
ok...so if you've such
issues with me...I'll go

01:34:34.167 --> 01:34:38.175
Last night I saw you seeing Piku...

01:34:38.375 --> 01:34:39.342
Can I go Dad?

01:34:39.542 --> 01:34:40.300
No...

01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:41.717
I was looking at you...

01:34:41.917 --> 01:34:45.467
Oh really, say the truth
or else you'll be in trouble

01:34:45.667 --> 01:34:46.467
Want enema...?

01:34:46.667 --> 01:34:48.717
Look I am not meditating here...

01:34:48.917 --> 01:34:50.675
I am ready for fourth marriage also

01:34:50.875 --> 01:34:53.425
If you've done little...then
do the rest later...

01:34:53.625 --> 01:34:55.102
lets end this here for today...

01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:01.592
So Mr.Choudhry...
ready to go back to Delhi...?

01:35:02.042 --> 01:35:03.175
Oh done with badminton...?

01:35:03.375 --> 01:35:06.137
Yeah...why...?

01:35:06.542 --> 01:35:07.717
So who all are there in your family?

01:35:07.917 --> 01:35:11.851
My sister,
mother...and father passed away...

01:35:12.167 --> 01:35:13.519
...father died...?

01:35:13.917 --> 01:35:17.842
Death...who said death? Who's death?

01:35:18.042 --> 01:35:19.425
Rama's father...he died...

01:35:19.625 --> 01:35:20.342
Not now, long back...

01:35:20.542 --> 01:35:21.342
What was the problem?

01:35:21.542 --> 01:35:22.550
No problem as such...

01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:23.717
Died without any problem?

01:35:23.917 --> 01:35:24.967
I mean he had cancer...

01:35:25.167 --> 01:35:27.717
So cancer is a problem...why
are you saying he had no problem?

01:35:27.917 --> 01:35:29.675
...well he had cancer
but it was removed...

01:35:29.875 --> 01:35:31.727
Oh ok...Where was it?

01:35:33.292 --> 01:35:33.842
Throat...

01:35:34.042 --> 01:35:35.967
Throat...aah smoking is it?

01:35:36.167 --> 01:35:37.143
Where are you going...?

01:35:37.625 --> 01:35:43.016
So they must've done tracheotomy
..for him to breathe..

01:35:43.792 --> 01:35:45.519
Did they reconstruct Food pipe also?

01:35:45.917 --> 01:35:47.175
Ya something like that...

01:35:47.375 --> 01:35:49.092
What do you mean
something like that...?

01:35:49.292 --> 01:35:49.717
I mean...

01:35:49.917 --> 01:35:50.800
You should know what
all the doctor did.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.092
Dad everyone is not
so interested in all this...

01:35:53.292 --> 01:35:55.675
...this medical nonsense
has become your hobby...

01:35:55.875 --> 01:35:56.842
hey I am not talking to you...

01:35:57.042 --> 01:35:58.092
lam also not talking to you...!

01:35:58.292 --> 01:35:58.967
Then...

01:35:59.167 --> 01:36:00.925
hey...listen where are
you going...then what happened?

01:36:01.125 --> 01:36:05.217
Nothing...he was in the ICU...
and then on a ventilator and...

01:36:05.417 --> 01:36:08.592
VENTILATOR?! You should've
not put him on a Ventilator...

01:36:08.792 --> 01:36:09.592
...it is wrong...

01:36:09.792 --> 01:36:12.342
Piku what he did to his father,
you don't do that with me,

01:36:12.542 --> 01:36:15.092
I'm telling you...you see...all
this is commercial business...

01:36:15.292 --> 01:36:18.050
professional money making...
why did you allow them to do it?

01:36:18.250 --> 01:36:19.217
Allow...I mean...I was...

01:36:19.417 --> 01:36:21.717
No no but why...why did you allow
them to do this to your father...

01:36:21.917 --> 01:36:23.300
look my father was on death bed...

01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:24.550
...doctor said we needed
to put him on the ventilator...

01:36:24.750 --> 01:36:25.342
...so what could've I done?

01:36:25.542 --> 01:36:28.467
I couldn't have said
no...it's not my decision...

01:36:28.667 --> 01:36:32.217
Of course it is! Do you've any idea how
much pain your father went through?

01:36:32.417 --> 01:36:33.925
...his whole body must've
been pricked with needles...

01:36:34.125 --> 01:36:37.717
...drip...blood...catheter
down below...ECG machine...

01:36:37.917 --> 01:36:41.100
...it's inhuman treatment...you
tortured your father!

01:36:41.542 --> 01:36:44.592
You get up if the Nurse picks you up...
be at her mercy to change your clothes...

01:36:44.792 --> 01:36:46.550
...and if you've passed motion in those
clothes, then just keep lying down,

01:36:46.750 --> 01:36:48.386
...waiting for her again...
oh gosh...no!!

01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:55.767
Look Piku...when I die, don't do all this
with me...I want to die in peace...!

01:37:03.167 --> 01:37:04.598
DO you always have to over do it!

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:08.425
But...I was only telling
you what not to do with me...

01:37:08.625 --> 01:37:13.014
why did he go?
did I say anything to him? No!

01:37:14.625 --> 01:37:16.227
Rana brother...

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:22.344
...grand pa has sent this
for you and has called you down...

01:37:37.917 --> 01:37:43.262
you don't need to be sorry... I didn't
feel bad...I am fine...it's ok...

01:37:43.542 --> 01:37:45.019
Sorry? for...?

01:37:45.417 --> 01:37:47.217
...check that...our
water pump is not working...

01:37:47.417 --> 01:37:50.976
...you did civil right?

01:37:54.167 --> 01:37:59.228
What? There...water...water
pump...its not working...

01:37:59.917 --> 01:38:01.592
Call an electrician...its
not my job...

01:38:01.792 --> 01:38:03.675
What do you mean...its not
your job...you must be knowing?

01:38:03.875 --> 01:38:06.425
Ok fine...I know...but I am getting late
so you call anyone else...I need to go...

01:38:06.625 --> 01:38:07.342
you're going now?

01:38:07.542 --> 01:38:08.925
Who who's going...No
no how can you go...?

01:38:09.125 --> 01:38:11.217
There's no water in the over
head tank..or in the bathroom...

01:38:11.417 --> 01:38:12.675
...or the flush...how can he go?

01:38:12.875 --> 01:38:16.889
I don't care... water or no water...
in flush or tank or wherever else...

01:38:17.417 --> 01:38:18.592
...its a plumber's job...not mine...

01:38:18.792 --> 01:38:19.342
What?

01:38:19.542 --> 01:38:21.217
How will I cook?...
there's no water in the kitchen...

01:38:21.417 --> 01:38:24.175
As if you were making
Mutton kebabs...? Huh!

01:38:24.375 --> 01:38:26.675
Fish rice...but that too I can't
cook now..we'll have to order in

01:38:26.875 --> 01:38:30.925
No mutton kebabs, Dr.Shrivastava
told me eat only pulses and rice..

01:38:31.125 --> 01:38:34.467
But brother how will she
cook rice...that needs water too

01:38:34.667 --> 01:38:35.925
Binod it's a useless argument...

01:38:36.125 --> 01:38:37.800
oh she just needs an
excuse to avoid cooking

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:38.885
What a useless argument“!

01:38:39.375 --> 01:38:40.636
Shut up!

01:38:45.125 --> 01:38:46.511
Where's the water pump...?

01:38:54.167 --> 01:38:55.644
Its on...check the water flow...

01:38:56.042 --> 01:38:57.769
Not coming...

01:39:13.792 --> 01:39:14.893
Are you angry?

01:39:15.417 --> 01:39:16.769
Not your fault...

01:39:20.167 --> 01:39:21.092
Now...?

01:39:21.292 --> 01:39:23.520
Not yet...

01:39:26.250 --> 01:39:27.727
Am I irritating you?

01:39:29.292 --> 01:39:31.395
I have a good tolerance...

01:39:32.750 --> 01:39:35.763
That means I am
talking to you forcibly

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.636
<i>'IQ-am</i>

01:39:39.042 --> 01:39:41.520

dad...ditto...same...

01:39:41.792 --> 01:39:43.519
Don't compare me with that man..

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.262
Water is coming...little...

01:39:50.417 --> 01:39:54.010
With your attitude, you won't
find any companion your entire life...

01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:57.467
Its not like that...if
I seek actively,

01:39:57.667 --> 01:40:00.520
somebody or the other
I'll definitely find...

01:40:02.125 --> 01:40:03.592
...worry about your self...

01:40:03.792 --> 01:40:07.010
...god forbid you shouldn't be left with
Budhan for company in your old age.

01:40:07.750 --> 01:40:10.387
I'm serious...just be aware...

01:40:10.875 --> 01:40:14.263
its better that you leave...really

01:40:16.917 --> 01:40:19.896
And there's Water now...

01:40:20.667 --> 01:40:22.217
Fine now I am also leaving...

01:40:22.417 --> 01:40:24.224

Ya I'll see where I get by
the evening...ok...I'll leave...

01:40:43.917 --> 01:40:45.342
You could've stayed

01:40:45.542 --> 01:40:48.967
Why? Not needed,

01:40:49.167 --> 01:40:56.890
...his family...no no you must go...

01:40:58.292 --> 01:41:02.010
Do you know what the real
issue is...Mr. Banerjee...

01:41:02.417 --> 01:41:03.467
What?

01:41:03.667 --> 01:41:05.974
No one understands you...

01:41:11.250 --> 01:41:12.511
You're right...

01:41:13.375 --> 01:41:14.425

01:41:14.625 --> 01:41:15.300

Do you meditate...?...

01:41:47.042 --> 01:41:50.225
Piku sister...all
well...greetings!...

01:41:51.250 --> 01:41:55.467
With this kind of a family...at

01:41:55.667 --> 01:41:59.967
...balanced...you must begin...
you'll stay relaxed

01:42:00.167 --> 01:42:01.268

01:42:12.500 --> 01:42:15.137
By the way my family is totally...

01:42:20.292 --> 01:42:22.842
...you thought you'll play this game
and we'll sell off the house...?

01:42:23.042 --> 01:42:25.967
No no elder brother...that
builder said..otherwise later...

01:42:26.167 --> 01:42:28.092
Later means when?

01:42:28.292 --> 01:42:30.592
Later even if all
these people have died...

01:42:30.792 --> 01:42:33.675
I'll be still alive...
to take care about this house Ok...

01:42:33.875 --> 01:42:35.967
Why will you take
care of our house...?

01:42:36.167 --> 01:42:36.842
Later when...?

01:42:37.042 --> 01:42:40.760
Aunty...Champa Kunj
will not be sold.

01:42:41.792 --> 01:42:46.011
And if uncle has no objection
then lets find a tenant...ok...

01:42:47.292 --> 01:42:48.473
thank you...

01:42:52.417 --> 01:42:54.849
Now you leave...ok?...

01:42:55.667 --> 01:43:01.103
What nonsense...waste of time...

01:43:37.042 --> 01:43:40.225
Ok Piku...
- Bye... bye

01:44:08.542 --> 01:44:10.925
Hey wait...is this your cycle?

01:44:11.125 --> 01:44:12.477
Yes

01:44:13.625 --> 01:44:18.845
Ya Syed,
I don't know when I'll come...

01:44:51.375 --> 01:44:52.636
How did he even go?...

01:44:53.042 --> 01:44:54.592
and why did you not wake me up...?

01:44:54.792 --> 01:44:56.967
But you know him Piku...

01:44:57.167 --> 01:44:58.967
Why didn't you lock the cycle...?

01:44:59.167 --> 01:45:01.019
He'd taken the keys last night...

01:45:02.542 --> 01:45:05.270
I've searched for him everywhere
but I couldn't find him

01:45:05.542 --> 01:45:09.010
Go and check once again

01:45:10.667 --> 01:45:13.759
whole life he kept mom
also stuck in all this...!

01:45:14.292 --> 01:45:18.511
She sacrificed her own happiness
to tolerate all his tantrums...

01:45:18.792 --> 01:45:20.300
...he said I want
to go to Kolkata...

01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:22.842
...so I said fine...I left
everything and came with him...

01:45:23.042 --> 01:45:24.644
...see what he is doing now...?

01:45:25.792 --> 01:45:27.599
What if he falls
down on the road...?

01:46:33.042 --> 01:46:35.019
He's here...

01:46:52.417 --> 01:46:57.262
I saw everything...
Writers Building...

01:46:57.750 --> 01:47:06.270
Dalhousie...Shyam Bazar...
and these dumplings...

01:47:12.542 --> 01:47:13.967
Who'll eat all this

01:47:14.167 --> 01:47:17.300
Because of him all my life I
have eaten pumpkin... bitter gourd...

01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:19.967
...and now he wants to eat this...

01:47:20.167 --> 01:47:21.974
...sweets and what not...

01:47:22.250 --> 01:47:23.761
...get Medicine from inside,

01:47:25.292 --> 01:47:26.717
I know what drama
is going to happen now...

01:47:26.917 --> 01:47:30.175
I am fine...no drama will happen

01:47:30.375 --> 01:47:31.592
You are not fine dad...

01:47:31.792 --> 01:47:32.925
and I will cycle tomorrow also...

01:47:33.125 --> 01:47:34.592
No you will not! Do you get that...?

01:47:34.792 --> 01:47:38.260
One month ago he had collapsed..
his BP had dropped...

01:47:38.542 --> 01:47:43.261
...suddenly one fine day you
can't cycle for 25 kilometers..

01:47:45.250 --> 01:47:47.800
...you think your lungs
are fit to do all this nonsense...

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.425
...your Heart cannot take it,
you are 70 yrs old...!

01:47:50.625 --> 01:47:51.675
Just doesn't listen.

01:47:51.875 --> 01:47:55.514
I said we'll take a flight
but no he wanted to go by road only!

01:47:57.542 --> 01:48:00.100
Have you ever thought what I want?

01:48:00.750 --> 01:48:02.511
Absolutely Selfish!!!

01:48:05.417 --> 01:48:07.342
Yes, I've had physical
relationships...

01:48:07.542 --> 01:48:09.842
...but is this something
he needs to tell every man I meet?

01:48:10.042 --> 01:48:13.925
That meet my daughter she is not a..
virgin..which father does this?

01:48:14.125 --> 01:48:17.104
Calm down piku...have some water

01:48:32.917 --> 01:48:33.643
What?

01:48:37.167 --> 01:48:37.893
Aahh

01:48:39.667 --> 01:48:44.092
Rana was right...one
should eat everything...

01:48:44.292 --> 01:48:45.268
Done?

01:48:45.875 --> 01:48:51.015
Like never before...Piku!

01:48:51.667 --> 01:48:55.385
...extraordinary...! best motion!

01:49:00.167 --> 01:49:02.717
Good...so no cycling
from tomorrow...

01:49:02.917 --> 01:49:05.550
I understand
you all are angry...

01:49:05.750 --> 01:49:11.516
...but everyone's way
to go has been decided...

01:49:11.917 --> 01:49:15.300
...even mine...
I know...even mine...it will be

01:49:15.500 --> 01:49:20.015
...through my digestive track...
my life will go from here...

01:49:20.750 --> 01:49:24.514
...so let me cycle...I am enjoying...

01:49:25.042 --> 01:49:29.386
...hey Binod...tomorrow...

01:49:37.125 --> 01:49:38.342
Piku...Piku...

01:49:38.542 --> 01:49:39.592
Haan Kaku?

01:49:39.792 --> 01:49:40.643
Piku...

01:49:42.375 --> 01:49:46.842
See what's happened to brother...
didn't wake up with an alarm also...

01:49:47.042 --> 01:49:49.520
...I also woke him...but
he says nothing...

01:49:50.625 --> 01:49:53.353
Moni..Moni..come fast

01:49:57.792 --> 01:49:58.342
Grand pa...

01:49:58.542 --> 01:50:03.102
I switched on the
light in the morning

01:50:04.292 --> 01:50:07.145
He didn't get up...

01:50:10.417 --> 01:50:11.217
Get up grand pa...

01:50:11.417 --> 01:50:12.393
Moni..

01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:15.352
What happened...?

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:21.263
Call Dr.Ghosh..

01:50:22.042 --> 01:50:24.099
Grand pa...

01:50:42.708 --> 01:50:46.347
Piku... hey Piku

01:51:34.875 --> 01:51:37.550
Oh..that means either
Cardiac Arrhythmia..

01:51:37.750 --> 01:51:39.511
Basically irregular heartbeat..

01:51:39.792 --> 01:51:41.144
...or Sleep Apnea..

01:51:43.042 --> 01:51:46.385
...respected brother always
wished for a peaceful death

01:51:46.792 --> 01:51:49.884
Yes uncle, no tube..no ventilation.

01:51:51.292 --> 01:51:56.637
...dad was happy,
he said it was the best motion...

01:51:59.750 --> 01:52:05.846
...he always forced me to listen to him
but he made sure death also listened to him

01:53:08.917 --> 01:53:12.009
let me tell you
all..dad was in peace..

01:53:12.500 --> 01:53:15.888
...he was in no pain..

01:53:16.792 --> 01:53:22.854
...and those who know dad..they know he
had just one problem. constipation..

01:53:24.250 --> 01:53:26.637
...but that too got
cured before he left..

01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:31.844
...so dad's death was a happy
one and I'm going to miss him...

01:53:33.417 --> 01:53:36.600
now no one will call
me from this room, Piku..Piku..

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:40.842
Bhashkor da was a
big attention seeker..

01:53:41.042 --> 01:53:46.228
...if that man sees Piku is here
all sad, roaming with her hair open...

01:53:46.542 --> 01:53:49.145
...he'll come immediately
and take her away too..

01:53:51.375 --> 01:53:54.137
Piku...I love Bhaskor da, ..

01:53:59.875 --> 01:54:02.012
Piku...come here for a minute

01:54:02.417 --> 01:54:05.092
or maybe he has already
made a plan of coming back...

01:54:05.292 --> 01:54:06.342
...as Piku's kid...

01:54:06.542 --> 01:54:09.342
daughter..don't mind me saying
but I need to tell you something..

01:54:09.542 --> 01:54:10.967
...but I will pray to
god...if he comes again...

01:54:11.167 --> 01:54:12.925
...then he should come
without constipation"

01:54:13.125 --> 01:54:16.968
...you and Syed are close; its ok;

01:54:17.500 --> 01:54:20.012
...but respected brother
had just one issue with this...

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.512
...look its my duty to tell you...

01:54:25.125 --> 01:54:31.847
...he felt in fact he was sure,
that Syed... he too has constipation..

01:54:43.917 --> 01:54:44.893
Syed..

01:54:46.667 --> 01:54:47.342
You want a drink?

01:54:47.542 --> 01:54:48.768
Do you have constipation?

01:54:49.417 --> 01:54:50.143
Huh?

01:54:50.375 --> 01:54:52.102
Do you have constipation...?

01:54:53.417 --> 01:54:53.967
<i>Ya“</i>

01:54:54.167 --> 01:54:55.300
Why didn't you tell me before...

01:54:55.500 --> 01:55:00.970
I mean..its not
chronic..just..Piku...

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:12.968
here... is the balance amount...
and this is for petrol

01:55:13.417 --> 01:55:16.600
And what about that
outing on Ganga ghat..

01:55:17.167 --> 01:55:18.675
...and that mental torture that I
went through because of your dad..

01:55:18.875 --> 01:55:20.477
...where is the money for all that?

01:55:21.667 --> 01:55:25.010
My god yaar...he kept
everyone on their toes...

01:55:27.542 --> 01:55:30.842
You can’t judge parents
no...no matter how they are...

01:55:31.042 --> 01:55:35.010
After taking care
of that kind of a man..

01:55:36.292 --> 01:55:39.092
...even you've come in the category
of Rani Laxmi Bai... Annie Besant...

01:55:39.292 --> 01:55:44.353
...kinds...you know...
the great women...

01:55:45.417 --> 01:55:49.886
anybody in my place
would've done that

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:53.602
No one does it these days

01:55:56.792 --> 01:55:58.394
So now...?

01:56:01.250 --> 01:56:03.353
...will you manage it alone...?

01:56:08.542 --> 01:56:10.269
I think so..

01:56:11.917 --> 01:56:17.137
I mean..that much
dad has prepared me..

01:56:23.542 --> 01:56:25.519
...it's a small spelling..

01:56:26.750 --> 01:56:31.094
...BHASKOR..BHASKOR..KOR..not KAR...

01:56:31.750 --> 01:56:34.478
...if it's not done by tomorrow,
I am not going to pay..

01:56:35.792 --> 01:56:37.098
KOR!

01:56:45.875 --> 01:56:51.015
