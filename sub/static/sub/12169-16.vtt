00:02.447 --> 00:04.324
l could never just say that to him.

00:04.527 --> 00:07.519
- Why not ? You like him, don’t you ?
- That is not the point.

00:07.687 --> 00:09.723
l think that’s exactly the point,
actually.

00:09.887 --> 00:12.606
The ways of my people are different.

00:12.767 --> 00:14.997
- l’d never--
- He’s not gonna make the first move.

00:15.167 --> 00:16.282
We shall see.

00:16.447 --> 00:18.642
Look, you know him better than l do--

00:18.807 --> 00:20.286
l would hope so.

00:20.447 --> 00:24.076
- -but l wouldn’t be surprised
if he was oblivious to the situation.

00:24.247 --> 00:26.841
- It bears no further discussion.
- All right.

00:27.007 --> 00:28.838
If you want someone to drop hints--

00:29.007 --> 00:31.885
You remember the last time
so many people had the day off ?

00:32.046 --> 00:33.719
Yeah, it’s all Heightmeyer’s doing.

00:33.887 --> 00:37.675
She insisted that the brass order
some sort of mandatory rest day.

00:37.847 --> 00:40.600
l guess down time here
doesn’t really happen organically.

00:40.767 --> 00:43.839
Hey, and don’t think l haven’t realized
you’ve changed the subject.

00:44.007 --> 00:46.123
My people have a day of rest
every four nights.

00:46.287 --> 00:48.403
- Now that is civilized.
- Yes.

00:48.567 --> 00:51.639
- Hey, wanna grab a late lunch ?
- l would like that.

00:51.887 --> 00:53.878
l forgot my bantos rods at the gym.

00:54.047 --> 00:56.038
- Can l meet you there ?
- Sure.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

02:39.087 --> 02:41.203
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:41.407 --> 02:44.365
- What are you doing here ?
- l work here.

02:45.287 --> 02:46.879
But it’s our day off.

02:47.527 --> 02:51.566
- Shouldn’t you be enjoying it, then ?
- l got behind on my research this week.

02:51.727 --> 02:55.083
Just wanted to drop off some results
for the next Earth transmission.

02:55.727 --> 02:57.319
Great.

02:57.567 --> 02:59.046
Good.

02:59.447 --> 03:02.280
l was thinking about grabbing
some food. Care to join ?

03:03.167 --> 03:05.965
- l can’t, l’ve--
- You’re not capable of having lunch ?

03:06.167 --> 03:08.886
- Yes, l’m capable.
- Are you planning on eating today ?

03:09.087 --> 03:10.918
- Of course.
- Great.

03:11.127 --> 03:12.845
Eat with me.

03:13.007 --> 03:15.316
Look, it’s nothing personal but...

03:16.727 --> 03:20.481
l make a point of not having relationships
with people who work for me.

03:21.047 --> 03:22.924
l don’t work for you.

03:23.927 --> 03:25.645
l’m your boss.

03:25.807 --> 03:28.765
Well, you’re my boss’boss, actually.

03:28.967 --> 03:31.037
Still, however indirectly...

03:31.247 --> 03:34.557
Yeah, but with that thinking,
everyone on this planet works for you.

03:34.727 --> 03:38.879
- You won’t be friends with any of them ?
- Friends is one thing.

03:39.087 --> 03:40.202
Oh, you think--

03:40.407 --> 03:42.238
Oh, wait.
l see what’s happening here.

03:42.447 --> 03:44.199
You think l’m asking you out
on a date.

03:44.367 --> 03:48.440
No, no, no. This isn’t a date.
This is lunch.

03:48.607 --> 03:51.644
This is the mandatory refueling
of our bodies.

03:51.807 --> 03:54.879
This is putting food in your mouth,
chewing it, having something...

03:55.047 --> 03:58.562
... more engaging than a wall
sitting across from you. That’s all it is.

03:58.727 --> 04:02.037
Come on. You gotta admit :
l’m more appealing than a wall, no ?

04:04.127 --> 04:08.086
No, you don’t have to admit it
but it’d be a massive blow to my ego...

04:08.247 --> 04:10.238
... if you thought otherwise.

04:11.007 --> 04:14.044
You are more appealing than a wall.

04:14.247 --> 04:16.317
Great. Now, what say we go grab
some grub ?

04:16.487 --> 04:19.206
- l still have an hour of work to do--
- An hour, then.

04:19.406 --> 04:21.238
l’Il see you in the mess hall.

04:30.767 --> 04:32.997
Élizabeth, you’re early.
Just give me a moment.

04:33.167 --> 04:34.759
How set on lunch were you today ?

04:35.847 --> 04:36.836
Why ?

04:37.047 --> 04:38.446
Well, something’s come up.

04:38.647 --> 04:41.798
Surely whatever work it is
you feel you must get done can wait.

04:41.967 --> 04:44.083
l was invited to lunch
by Mike Branton.

04:45.007 --> 04:45.996
Oh, really ?

04:46.207 --> 04:49.916
- You and l, we had plans--
- My friend, Dr. Hewston radioed me.

04:50.087 --> 04:53.523
She wants me to teach her
some bantos fighting this afternoon...

04:53.687 --> 04:54.961
... so do not worry.

04:55.127 --> 04:57.721
l will have something to occupy
my time.

04:58.287 --> 05:00.005
Okay.

05:00.327 --> 05:03.444
- Are you sure ?
- Yes.

05:03.927 --> 05:05.280
Okay.

05:11.487 --> 05:12.886
Hello.

05:13.047 --> 05:15.880
Oh, don’t you look lovely.

05:16.047 --> 05:17.162
Thank you, Carson.

05:17.327 --> 05:20.683
It’s the first time l’ve seen you
out of your uniform in quite some time.

05:20.847 --> 05:22.565
No, l don’t know about that.

05:22.727 --> 05:25.400
- Off somewhere special ?
- No, just getting some lunch.

05:25.567 --> 05:27.842
Rodney and l are going fishing
on the mainland.

05:28.007 --> 05:30.157
l know, l cleared the use
for the Jumper.

05:30.327 --> 05:33.046
Care to join us ? Who knows
what kind of fish we’Il find ?

05:33.207 --> 05:34.959
That’s very kind but some other time.

05:36.127 --> 05:37.640
What ? Do you have a hot date ?

05:37.847 --> 05:39.599
What ? Who told you that ?

05:39.807 --> 05:41.957
No one. l was joking. l was right.
Who is it ?

05:44.567 --> 05:46.478
None of my business.

05:46.687 --> 05:48.882
- Have a lovely afternoon, Élizabeth.
- Thank you.

05:49.047 --> 05:51.277
- You smell good too.
- Shut up.

05:51.447 --> 05:53.039
- You believe that ?
- Yes.

05:53.207 --> 05:56.483
- Truly and in your heart ?
- l do.

05:57.247 --> 05:58.236
What ?

05:58.407 --> 06:00.523
l don’t know
that l can ever respect you again.

06:00.727 --> 06:01.876
Come on.

06:02.047 --> 06:05.403
<i>You think When Harry met Sally is better
than Annie Hall ? You’re crazy.</i>

06:05.607 --> 06:07.165
It is.

06:09.087 --> 06:11.726
<i>When Harry met Sally
is essentially a remake...</i>

06:11.927 --> 06:14.805
<i>... a cheap imitation,
a bad cover-song version of Annie Hall.</i>

06:14.967 --> 06:17.083
- You realize that, right ?
- l disagree.

06:17.287 --> 06:19.926
l know you do,
but that’s what makes you crazy.

06:20.127 --> 06:21.765
l guess this will never work out.

06:22.847 --> 06:25.042
- This ?
- Lunch.

06:28.687 --> 06:29.676
Now...

06:30.287 --> 06:33.962
... does that mean that you don’t believe
that men and women can be friends ?

06:34.167 --> 06:36.522
- l never said that.
- You didn’t have to say it.

06:36.687 --> 06:39.599
<i>Any lady that likes When Harry met Sally
thinks men and women...</i>

06:39.767 --> 06:42.804
- ... can’t be friends.
- Fine. Maybe l do.

06:44.447 --> 06:45.721
So where does that leave me ?

06:45.927 --> 06:48.157
l guess that leaves you at lunch.

06:52.127 --> 06:54.038
- Come on.
- Where ?

06:55.047 --> 06:59.165
If lunch is all l get, l’m going to get
as much bang for my buck as possible.

07:03.047 --> 07:06.164
- It really is beautiful here, isn’t it ?
- Yeah.

07:11.327 --> 07:12.919
All done ?

07:14.327 --> 07:15.919
All done.

07:16.487 --> 07:19.047
l guess lunch is over.

07:19.607 --> 07:20.960
l guess it is.

07:21.127 --> 07:22.526
l should have brought dessert.

07:22.687 --> 07:24.723
It would have lasted longer.

07:26.727 --> 07:28.365
l should really get back anyway.

07:28.527 --> 07:30.597
What are you doing tomorrow ?

07:30.807 --> 07:32.126
- Mike--
- No, l like you...

07:32.327 --> 07:33.806
... and l’m extremely charming.

07:34.647 --> 07:37.002
l’d like to see you spin those
into negatives.

07:37.207 --> 07:39.596
- l don’t think--
- Probably best you don’t think.

07:39.807 --> 07:42.037
Would you stop interrupting me ?

07:42.247 --> 07:44.363
- You have a tendency to do that.
- l do not.

07:44.527 --> 07:47.200
Yes, you do.
l hate it when people interrupt me.

07:47.367 --> 07:51.406
Well, if l hadn’t interrupted you
we would never have had lunch.

07:52.527 --> 07:54.916
Life needs a little interrupting
every now and again.

07:56.007 --> 07:57.884
All right, l don’t completely disagree.

08:07.407 --> 08:10.285
Was that way out of line ?

08:15.927 --> 08:17.155
l can’t do this.

08:17.807 --> 08:21.322
- Just because we work together ?
- This would split my focus.

08:21.527 --> 08:23.677
- Give it a chance, see if it--
- l’m sorry. l--

08:24.327 --> 08:27.080
l shouldn’t have done this
in the first place. l thought l--

08:27.247 --> 08:30.956
<i>Dr. Weir, please report
to the control room immediately.</i>

08:34.886 --> 08:36.035
What’s going on ?

08:36.207 --> 08:38.515
An explosion at the base of the tower
near the gym.

08:38.687 --> 08:42.202
Early reports have at least three dead
and a dozen or so severely injured.

08:42.366 --> 08:44.437
Explosion ?
Was there an equipment malfunction ?

08:44.607 --> 08:47.360
We’re going over the data logs
but it wasn’t a malfunction.

08:47.887 --> 08:49.878
So it could have been a bomb ?

08:55.287 --> 08:58.040
Oh, hey, there you are.
Been looking all over for you.

08:59.127 --> 09:00.401
What, you forget ?

09:01.287 --> 09:03.403
- No.
- You forgot.

09:03.607 --> 09:07.725
You were going to teach Ronon
and myself how to play golf.

09:08.047 --> 09:09.116
That’s the plan.

09:09.287 --> 09:11.517
l’m afraid l have made other plans.

09:11.927 --> 09:14.646
- What other plans ?
- Having lunch with Élizabeth.

09:15.047 --> 09:16.275
Well, you still got time.

09:17.087 --> 09:18.998
Yes, true.

09:19.167 --> 09:22.000
However, l’m afraid l have been
quite delinquent...

09:22.167 --> 09:23.680
... in filing my mission reports.

09:24.167 --> 09:26.806
l had hoped to get caught up
before l met with Élizabeth.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.878
- Okay.
- If you would like, l could cancel--

09:29.047 --> 09:30.321
No. No. No.

09:30.487 --> 09:33.365
She could use a little time
out of the office. Some other time.

09:34.047 --> 09:35.719
Some other time.

09:40.847 --> 09:43.884
You know, John,
l got mission reports too.

09:44.047 --> 09:46.686
Nice try. It’s gonna be fun.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.555
Fun ?

09:53.287 --> 09:54.561
Nice shot.

09:54.727 --> 09:58.766
Thank you, Jim.
It was pretty nice, though, huh ?

10:01.447 --> 10:04.644
So that’s the sport ? You just hit
a little ball as far as you can ?

10:04.887 --> 10:09.005
First, it’s a game, and, no,
it’s a little more complicated than that.

10:10.807 --> 10:15.676
See, there are 18 holes, all made up
of varying lengths and dimensions.

10:15.887 --> 10:19.277
First goal is to hit the ball
through water and sand hazards...

10:19.447 --> 10:22.644
... till you land on the green.
Then you putt the ball into the hole.

10:23.527 --> 10:24.846
So this is a water hazard ?

10:25.207 --> 10:29.041
Well, we don’t have a course yet.
All we have is a driving range...

10:29.247 --> 10:31.124
- ... where you--
- Just hit a little ball ?

10:31.767 --> 10:32.995
Pretty much, yeah.

10:33.207 --> 10:35.277
What’s so hard about that ?

10:35.647 --> 10:39.401
Well, l make it look easy
but l’ve been playing since l was 6.

10:40.367 --> 10:42.437
So although it seems simple...

10:42.647 --> 10:47.084
... developing a sweet swing like mine
takes years--

10:52.847 --> 10:53.882
Like that ?

10:54.487 --> 10:57.399
- That was okay.
- Okay ? You can’t see where it landed.

10:57.567 --> 11:00.604
Well, it’s not a distance game,
it’s an accuracy one.

11:00.807 --> 11:02.479
Pick a spot, l’Il hit it there.

11:03.007 --> 11:04.406
First off, your grip :

11:04.687 --> 11:05.881
It’s all wrong.

11:06.047 --> 11:07.878
Oh, yes, of course. There you are.

11:08.047 --> 11:10.436
l wanted see you.
l’ve been having this weird pain--

11:10.607 --> 11:12.563
Hold on, sorry. Let me stop you there.

11:12.727 --> 11:14.718
It’s the first day l’ve had off
in a month.

11:14.887 --> 11:17.720
Dr. Cole is in the infirmary
and would be glad to help you.

11:17.887 --> 11:19.923
- Okay. Fair enough.
- Right.

11:20.207 --> 11:21.435
What’s up, Carson ?

11:21.647 --> 11:23.797
- Fishing.
- What ?

11:24.007 --> 11:27.761
Rodney and l are heading to the mainland
to catch a fish that’s like a trout.

11:27.927 --> 11:30.487
Care to join us ? Sport of kings.

11:30.687 --> 11:32.962
l thought horse racing was
the sport of kings.

11:33.607 --> 11:35.086
For the boring kings, maybe.

11:35.247 --> 11:37.238
Carson, you’re Scottish.
This is your game.

11:37.407 --> 11:40.365
- Wouldn’t you rather be on the range ?
- It was never my thing.

11:40.527 --> 11:42.085
Come on, last chance.

11:44.287 --> 11:46.198
l think we’re gonna pass.

11:46.367 --> 11:51.282
All right. Don’t be jealous when l return
with a record-breaking space trout.

11:51.447 --> 11:52.721
Thank you.

11:53.287 --> 11:56.677
- We’Il try to contain ourselves.
- Oh, aye.

12:01.767 --> 12:04.679
Time for a real sport. Come on.

12:16.607 --> 12:20.520
- Grab the other guy’s flag ? That’s it ?
- That’s it.

12:20.807 --> 12:23.275
- No penalties and stuff ?
- What ?

12:23.447 --> 12:26.564
Well, if the other guy pulls your hair
or tries to bite you ?

12:26.727 --> 12:28.240
Bite back.

12:28.407 --> 12:29.681
Right.

12:29.887 --> 12:33.846
- You ready ?
- Ready as l’Il ever be.

12:37.207 --> 12:41.086
- That’s one for me.
- Two out of three.

12:41.967 --> 12:46.085
- Round 2 : one-handed.
- What ?

12:46.287 --> 12:50.280
After every round, the level of difficulty
is increased. It’s to simulate battle :

12:50.447 --> 12:52.517
After an encounter,
the possibility of injury.

12:52.687 --> 12:54.882
Round 2 : one-handed.

12:55.327 --> 12:59.718
Let me get better at Round 1
before we move on to the harder part ?

13:01.767 --> 13:04.281
Okay. Round 2.

13:12.127 --> 13:14.721
- It’s two for me.
- Three out of five.

13:15.167 --> 13:18.443
You know, l could do this all day.
Haven’t even broken a sweat yet.

13:18.607 --> 13:20.325
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:22.007 --> 13:23.725
Round 3.

13:26.247 --> 13:29.398
Oh, come on.
Oh, you are making this stuff up.

13:29.607 --> 13:31.518
This is not a traditional Satedan sport.

13:31.687 --> 13:34.884
This is an excuse to make me look dumb
and kick my ass.

13:35.167 --> 13:36.202
If you wanna quit...

13:48.487 --> 13:49.920
Sorry.

13:50.287 --> 13:53.165
- This game sucks.
- You need to focus.

13:53.367 --> 13:56.325
l don’t know if that’s going
to be possible again.

13:58.527 --> 14:01.485
Here, help me get up. l got an idea.

14:04.127 --> 14:06.277
It hurts, doesn’t it ?

14:09.167 --> 14:10.998
- Like that ?
- Yeah, you gotta hit it...

14:11.367 --> 14:13.164
- ... straight on, hard as you can.
- Okay.

14:13.367 --> 14:16.837
This is what l’m talking about.
This is how you spend a day off :

14:17.007 --> 14:20.363
Kick back, eat some junk food,
listen to some tunes.

14:20.527 --> 14:21.676
You like this music ?

14:22.487 --> 14:23.761
What ? You don’t ?

14:23.967 --> 14:25.764
It’s fine.

14:26.927 --> 14:28.121
l’m gonna stick to golf.

14:28.287 --> 14:31.006
Your game’s a little too much
like my day job.

14:31.727 --> 14:34.878
So, how long have you been here now ?
A year ?

14:35.087 --> 14:37.282
- Year and a half.
- Year and a half ?

14:38.767 --> 14:41.361
You ever hang out with anyone else
besides me and Teyla ?

14:41.807 --> 14:44.321
l’m not saying we’re sick of you
or anything.

14:44.527 --> 14:46.165
l don’t know. Are you dating anyone ?

14:46.367 --> 14:47.516
You mean like a woman ?

14:48.127 --> 14:49.196
Or a man ?

14:50.487 --> 14:52.000
No.

14:53.047 --> 14:54.799
l’m not ready yet.

14:57.527 --> 14:58.801
Not ready yet ?

15:00.767 --> 15:02.598
Did you leave somebody behind
on Sateda ?

15:05.647 --> 15:07.160
Wife ?

15:08.287 --> 15:09.959
Close enough.

15:13.087 --> 15:14.156
Sorry.

15:15.647 --> 15:16.636
What about you ?

15:16.807 --> 15:18.445
Yeah, what about me ?

15:18.607 --> 15:20.006
When are you getting married ?

15:20.967 --> 15:23.800
l’ve already done that.
Not very good at it.

15:24.007 --> 15:28.603
Besides there really isn’t
anyone here that-- Yeah, you know...

15:29.407 --> 15:32.319
See, l always thought
you and Teyla would-- You know...

15:32.847 --> 15:35.315
- Really ?
- Yeah. Why not ?

15:41.927 --> 15:43.076
Bright lights. Go, move.

15:43.247 --> 15:46.717
All right, let’s get these two
to the O.R. right away.

15:48.287 --> 15:50.039
- What happened here ?
- An explosion.

15:50.207 --> 15:52.277
At least three dead,
a dozen or so injured.

15:52.447 --> 15:53.926
Doc ?

15:55.447 --> 15:57.199
Oh, Lord. Teyla.

15:57.367 --> 16:00.086
- She gonna be okay, doc ?
- She’s lost a great deal of blood.

16:00.287 --> 16:03.757
- Get her to the infirmary, stat.
- Is she gonna be all right ?

16:03.967 --> 16:05.639
Let’s go. Let’s move.

16:07.487 --> 16:09.921
- What happened here, Radek ?
- There was an explosion.

16:10.087 --> 16:12.043
- l get that, but why ?
- l’m not sure yet.

16:12.207 --> 16:14.596
l wasn’t allowed in
till the crews cleared the floor.

16:14.767 --> 16:16.883
- What took you so long ?
- Transporters are down.

16:17.047 --> 16:19.880
- Lots of stairs.
- McKay’s in his lab. Might have a lead.

16:20.047 --> 16:21.639
- What kind of lead ?
- He didn’t say.

16:21.807 --> 16:25.686
The good news is the structure is intact
so there’s no danger of the tower falling.

16:25.847 --> 16:28.202
- There is, however, something very odd.
- What ?

16:28.407 --> 16:30.318
The few eyewitness reports
that we have...

16:30.487 --> 16:33.206
... say Dr. Hewston just blew up.

16:33.407 --> 16:35.443
- What does that mean ?
- Is that even possible ?

16:35.607 --> 16:37.962
Normally l’d agree
but from what we can tell...

16:38.127 --> 16:40.721
... she was standing in the hall
and just exploded.

16:40.887 --> 16:43.321
So what ? Suicide bomb ?

16:43.527 --> 16:46.644
That’s what l thought too originally,
but l’ve scanned the area...

16:46.807 --> 16:50.402
... and there isn’t even the slightest trace
of explosive residue.

16:52.087 --> 16:54.476
We’ve no idea
what we’re dealing with here.

16:59.487 --> 17:00.715
l’m a pretty easy guy to work for.

17:02.407 --> 17:05.240
l am usually too busy
doing all the really important stuff...

17:05.446 --> 17:08.007
... to micromanage the things
l need you to be doing.

17:08.487 --> 17:10.921
Because of that,
you have a fair amount of freedom.

17:11.127 --> 17:13.435
That does not mean
you can do whatever you please.

17:13.646 --> 17:17.002
There are rules, there are protocols,
not only to protect the city...

17:17.166 --> 17:18.805
... but your sorry little existences.

17:19.007 --> 17:21.919
- If l could just--
- You cannot. You cannot interrupt me.

17:22.087 --> 17:24.726
l was having a wonderful dream
before l got this call.

17:24.926 --> 17:26.359
You can stand there and listen.

17:26.727 --> 17:30.686
You were sent on a routine cataloging
of one of the abandoned Ancient labs...

17:30.847 --> 17:33.839
... and you activate a device
without having a clue what it was ?

17:34.047 --> 17:36.322
- We thought it was a--
- Yes. You thought wrong.

17:36.487 --> 17:38.717
But the other week you did the same,
so l don’t--

17:38.887 --> 17:43.039
But l am me. If l make a mistake,
l can fix it. You are you.

17:43.247 --> 17:46.239
And when you make mistakes,
you don’t have to fix them. l do.

17:46.407 --> 17:49.479
The second we realized it was
emitting radiation, we turned it off.

17:49.647 --> 17:51.126
So what ? What, you want a medal ?

17:51.287 --> 17:54.677
My 4-year-old niece could too
if it was emitting radiation.

17:54.887 --> 17:58.084
That does not make you smart
that just makes you a little less stupid.

17:58.247 --> 17:59.282
Rodney, be nice.

17:59.607 --> 18:03.600
So ? Are they gonna live ?
More importantly, can l go back to bed ?

18:03.847 --> 18:06.281
According to the scan and tests,
they’Il be all right.

18:06.487 --> 18:08.364
You should check back in 24 hours.

18:08.527 --> 18:10.165
We’Il run more tests to be certain.

18:10.327 --> 18:13.797
You were lucky because we are
in a place where flipping a switch...

18:13.967 --> 18:16.527
... could domino out into thousands
of people dying.

18:16.727 --> 18:18.683
You need to be more careful.

18:21.287 --> 18:23.118
Okay.

18:23.287 --> 18:26.882
- Take tomorrow off, all right ?
- We already have tomorrow off.

18:27.047 --> 18:28.685
It’s the mandatory rest day.

18:28.887 --> 18:30.320
It is ?

18:30.567 --> 18:32.205
Already ?

18:37.327 --> 18:38.999
Oh, great.

18:47.567 --> 18:49.080
Katie ?

18:50.407 --> 18:52.637
Hello ? Katie ?

18:52.807 --> 18:54.081
- Rodney.
- There you are.

18:54.287 --> 18:57.006
- What are you doing here ?
- What are you doing here ?

18:57.167 --> 19:00.637
Well, l’m nursing these little baby ferns
we found on M4L-279.

19:00.807 --> 19:04.083
At this stage, they’re very fragile
and if l leave them too long...

19:04.247 --> 19:06.317
- ... they’Il die.
- So what ? They’re ferns.

19:07.327 --> 19:11.445
Oh, which is to say, you need time off,
just like everyone else does.

19:11.607 --> 19:15.885
l know, it’s just-- They produce
this enzyme that might cure leukemia.

19:16.167 --> 19:18.556
- What ? These guys ? Really ?
- Yeah.

19:18.887 --> 19:21.560
What are you doing with your day off ?
You had plans.

19:21.767 --> 19:24.327
Oh, l do with Beckett.
That’s kind of why l’m here.

19:24.847 --> 19:26.838
Yeah, l need an excuse
to break those plans.

19:27.047 --> 19:29.038
- Why’s that ?
- Because we’re going fishing.

19:29.247 --> 19:32.364
And to be honest, l cannot think
of a more torturous way...

19:32.527 --> 19:37.078
... of spending a day than up to my hips
in water, getting worms on hooks...

19:37.287 --> 19:40.006
... and having all the time
to listen to Carson’s views...

19:40.167 --> 19:43.557
... on what l’m sure are a vast number
of impossibly boring subjects.

19:43.727 --> 19:45.877
l mean, it is unappealing in every way.

19:46.087 --> 19:48.078
Why did you say yes in the first place ?

19:48.287 --> 19:51.006
He said,« ou » ?You wanna go fishing
next month ? » It sounded far.

19:51.167 --> 19:53.601
Something could come up,
l’d be able to get out of it.

19:53.767 --> 19:55.962
- Here we are a month later--
- Nothing’s come up.

19:56.127 --> 20:00.325
Exactly. So if l told him we finally had
an afternoon where l could...

20:00.487 --> 20:02.398
... take you out to lunch
or something...

20:02.567 --> 20:04.080
... then he’d have no choice.

20:04.247 --> 20:06.761
l can’t. l need to baby-sit the ferns.

20:06.967 --> 20:11.085
Right. Well, if l had a nickel
for every time a girl used that line...

20:12.687 --> 20:14.882
You know what ?
Let me bring lunch to you.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.720
- We can eat here.
- You wanna baby-sit ferns with me ?

20:17.927 --> 20:21.556
In the battle between ferns versus fish,
ferns win a decisive victory.

20:21.767 --> 20:24.725
- That would be lovely.
- Great. Okay. l’Il be right back.

20:24.887 --> 20:26.320
Okay.

20:40.127 --> 20:42.516
Would you look at that ?
Great minds think alike.

20:42.687 --> 20:46.157
- l thought l’d pick us up snacks as well.
- Yes. About that.

20:46.847 --> 20:48.166
- Rodney.
- Here’s the thing.

20:48.327 --> 20:50.318
- You know l’d love to go with you.
- l don’t.

20:50.487 --> 20:53.126
l would. l do.
l just ran into Katie Brown.

20:53.287 --> 20:54.640
She laid the guilt on...

20:54.807 --> 20:57.241
... how l never see her,
how the one day l get off...

20:57.407 --> 20:59.796
... l’m off to the coast to fish
with my best buddy.

21:00.007 --> 21:03.443
She and l see so little of each other.
Not sure we count as a couple. Look.

21:04.087 --> 21:05.725
- Long story short.
- Too late.

21:05.927 --> 21:08.566
l told Katie l would spend
the day with her.

21:10.407 --> 21:12.238
- All right.
- If it was anybody else--

21:12.407 --> 21:13.396
No, no, l understand.

21:13.607 --> 21:15.882
Yeah, next week.
l’m 100 percent there.

21:16.567 --> 21:18.876
- You promise ?
- Absolutely.

21:19.647 --> 21:20.921
- Okay.
- It’s still early.

21:21.087 --> 21:23.726
- l’m sure you’Il find someone else.
- You can bet on that.

21:23.927 --> 21:26.646
Well, tell Katie l said hello.

21:26.807 --> 21:29.367
- Will do.
- Enjoy.

21:29.527 --> 21:30.960
l will.

21:31.447 --> 21:33.119
Yes.

21:38.087 --> 21:39.281
This is lovely.

21:39.447 --> 21:40.675
It is, yes.

21:40.847 --> 21:44.283
l got to say, after all
the Cadman craziness last year...

21:44.447 --> 21:47.245
... l figured there was no chance for us.

21:48.007 --> 21:50.123
- Why’s that ?
- You had another consciousness...

21:50.287 --> 21:53.518
... in your body, one that took over
during our first date...

21:53.727 --> 21:55.922
... and made you kiss me.

21:56.087 --> 21:58.555
l mean, it was awkward.

21:59.287 --> 22:01.517
- So you ignored me for a few months.
- l did not.

22:01.727 --> 22:05.083
Yeah. Yes, you did.
l mean, it’s okay, l guess.

22:05.527 --> 22:07.597
l can’t imagine going through that...

22:07.767 --> 22:09.997
... and l wouldn’t wanna be
reminded of it either.

22:10.167 --> 22:12.522
Yes, well, it was a little weird
there for a bit.

22:12.687 --> 22:14.006
For the last little while...

22:14.207 --> 22:16.926
... you’ve really made an effort
to make time for me.

22:18.287 --> 22:20.278
And it has been lovely.

22:23.047 --> 22:24.799
It’s funny, you know ?

22:25.007 --> 22:28.158
As much as l hate to admit it,
seeing my little sister so happy...

22:28.327 --> 22:30.283
... with her family, l just--

22:31.007 --> 22:33.475
Well, it kind of made me realize that--

22:33.847 --> 22:35.246
Well...

22:35.527 --> 22:37.358
... l’d like to get married.

22:37.527 --> 22:39.119
You would ?

22:39.287 --> 22:40.879
Oh, no. Not to you.

22:41.407 --> 22:42.965
Oh, no, no, no.

22:43.127 --> 22:46.403
Not to you. l was--
That was not a proposal. l was just...

22:46.607 --> 22:47.642
- ... talking.
- Right.

22:47.807 --> 22:48.796
Don’t get the wrong--

22:48.967 --> 22:51.481
It’s not l wouldn’t be interested
in getting married...

22:51.647 --> 22:55.162
... to someone like you. Just like you.
You even maybe. One day. l just--

22:55.367 --> 22:57.244
l know, l know. It’s okay.

22:57.447 --> 23:00.086
l like you a lot. l mean, l do.

23:00.287 --> 23:02.721
l know you do and l like you a lot too.

23:03.527 --> 23:05.119
l know.

23:05.647 --> 23:09.242
And to be honest,
l find that just baffling.

23:09.447 --> 23:10.766
- Come on.
- No, no, no.

23:10.927 --> 23:12.565
Other people find it baffling too.

23:12.767 --> 23:14.803
l guess they don’t know you
like l know you.

23:15.007 --> 23:16.281
But that’s what scares me.

23:16.447 --> 23:18.642
l mean, you’Il know me
the way they know me--

23:18.807 --> 23:20.525
l think l know you pretty well.

23:20.727 --> 23:22.843
There’s not a lot of subtext with you.

23:25.207 --> 23:27.004
l am really sorry...

23:27.167 --> 23:29.476
... that l ignored you all that time.

23:30.807 --> 23:32.160
l bet you are.

23:35.207 --> 23:38.802
- What was that ?
- l don’t know. Look, l gotta go.

23:41.127 --> 23:43.118
So what ? Suicide bomb ?

23:43.287 --> 23:47.405
That’s what l thought too originally,
but l’ve scanned the area...

23:47.567 --> 23:50.718
... and there isn’t even the slightest trace
of explosive residue.

23:50.967 --> 23:53.037
l’ve no idea
what we’re dealing with here.

23:53.247 --> 23:56.080
<i>-Zelenka, do you read ?
- Yes, l’m here with Sheppard and Ronon.</i>

23:56.247 --> 23:59.045
<i>- What have you got ?
-You’re all gonna wanna see this.</i>

24:01.367 --> 24:05.076
All right. l’m digesting this as l go,
so forgive the rough edges.

24:05.247 --> 24:06.999
- What do you got ?
- Now, last night...

24:07.167 --> 24:09.317
... Dr. Hewston and her partner,
Dr. Watson...

24:09.487 --> 24:11.762
... were cataloging a new Ancient lab
we uncovered.

24:11.927 --> 24:15.317
They inadvertently activated
this machine.

24:15.487 --> 24:17.876
It started to emit a very odd type
of radiation...

24:18.047 --> 24:20.242
... but they were able to turn it off
right away.

24:20.407 --> 24:23.444
Dr. Beckett examined them
and gave them a clean bill of health.

24:23.607 --> 24:25.438
So with no immediate,
apparent danger...

24:25.607 --> 24:28.041
... we decided to figure out
what the device was...

24:28.207 --> 24:29.356
... whenever we had time.

24:29.567 --> 24:31.797
- That was a mistake.
- What is it ?

24:32.007 --> 24:35.716
Well, the science of it is--
Well, it’s spectacularly complicated.

24:35.887 --> 24:39.118
It appears to be a weapon created
by the Ancients to battle the Wraith.

24:39.287 --> 24:42.882
One that was abandoned fairly early on
as it affected everyone in proximity...

24:43.047 --> 24:46.676
- ... including Ancients and humans.
- Affected them how ?

24:46.887 --> 24:51.039
Well, long story short,
it creates explosive tumors.

24:51.247 --> 24:53.158
- Explosive tumors ?
- What ?

24:53.327 --> 24:55.397
- Are you kidding me ?
- Yeah, l wish. Look.

24:55.567 --> 24:56.761
It’s actually ingenious.

24:56.927 --> 25:00.158
Look, the device emits millions
of irradiated particles...

25:00.327 --> 25:03.763
... genetically programmed to enter
our systems and gather behind the lungs.

25:03.927 --> 25:06.077
Now, as they go,
they collect trace elements...

25:06.287 --> 25:09.677
... from our body that they need
to complete an explosive compound...

25:09.847 --> 25:14.284
... which, once in place, the tumor
reaches critical mass and explodes.

25:14.487 --> 25:16.717
- Wait. This guy, Watson--
- Has been exposed.

25:16.887 --> 25:20.118
Find him before the tumor ignites,
which could be any minute now.

25:20.287 --> 25:22.881
It’s not good but not awful.
We need to start right away.

25:23.047 --> 25:24.560
What’s his name ?

25:25.127 --> 25:27.687
James. James Watson.

25:34.647 --> 25:36.877
Next week, l am 100 percent there.

25:37.047 --> 25:38.400
- You promise ?
- Absolutely.

25:39.207 --> 25:40.606
- Okay.
- It’s still early.

25:40.767 --> 25:43.600
- l’m sure you’Il find someone else.
- You can bet on that.

25:43.767 --> 25:45.962
Well, tell Katie l said, hello.

25:46.127 --> 25:47.526
- Yeah. Will do.
- Enjoy.

25:47.687 --> 25:49.040
l will.

25:57.807 --> 26:01.117
- Son of a bitch. Stop that.
- Stop what ? Winning ?

26:01.287 --> 26:03.084
- You haven’t won yet.
- Carson.

26:03.247 --> 26:05.203
- Come to join the chess club ?
- Not quite.

26:05.407 --> 26:07.125
- You’ve come to watch ?
- Well...

26:07.287 --> 26:11.200
... no, actually, l’m looking for someone
to come fishing with me. Rodney bailed.

26:11.727 --> 26:13.638
- Surprise, surprise.
- l know. Any interest ?

26:13.807 --> 26:15.718
l would but we’re playing
for trades today.

26:15.887 --> 26:18.321
No one can really beat me, so--
l’ve won a desk fan...

26:18.487 --> 26:20.955
... Dr. Mallozzi’s anime DVD collection...

26:21.127 --> 26:25.120
... and coupon for a Swedish massage
from Dr. Ambrose.

26:26.287 --> 26:29.996
- Perhaps we can go fishing next week ?
- Okay, all right, best of luck to you.

26:30.167 --> 26:32.237
Oh, l don’t need luck.

26:32.687 --> 26:36.077
- Checkmate.
- Son of a bitch.

26:44.007 --> 26:46.282
- You paint ?
- Hey, doc.

26:46.927 --> 26:48.997
Yeah. l paint.

26:49.167 --> 26:50.486
And you’re good too.

26:50.647 --> 26:54.162
My mom was an art teacher.
It’s what we did on weekends.

26:54.327 --> 26:57.319
l stopped for a while.
Didn’t have time during basic training...

26:57.487 --> 26:59.762
... and the first couple
of years on duty...

26:59.927 --> 27:03.317
... but l’ve been picking it up again.
Hard not to, with views like that.

27:03.487 --> 27:05.079
Aye.

27:05.767 --> 27:09.555
l don’t suppose there’s any chance
you’d like to come fishing with me ?

27:09.767 --> 27:14.557
If you’d got to me earlier, maybe,
but l kind of want to finish this up.

27:16.247 --> 27:17.362
It looks done to me.

27:17.527 --> 27:22.601
That is why l am the painter
and you are the doctor.

27:22.767 --> 27:25.520
Very good point.
Enjoy the rest of your day, major.

27:25.687 --> 27:27.325
Oh, you can count on it.

27:30.567 --> 27:32.922
- Oh, hey there, sir.
- Hello. l was--

27:33.087 --> 27:35.521
You know what’s crazy ?
l was just thinking about you.

27:35.727 --> 27:37.206
Does that ever happen to you ?

27:37.367 --> 27:40.086
You’re thinking about something,
and boom, there it is.

27:40.287 --> 27:42.357
It’s not that l’m psychic
but who knows ?

27:42.567 --> 27:44.956
- Well, actually--
- You know what ? l am sorry.

27:45.167 --> 27:48.079
You were trying to say something
and l interrupted you.

27:48.247 --> 27:50.715
Enjoy your day off, Dr. Biro.

27:50.927 --> 27:52.076
Absolutely.

27:52.287 --> 27:53.561
Bye-bye.

28:00.287 --> 28:01.276
Slow day ?

28:01.447 --> 28:03.836
Carson. What are you doing here ?
It’s your day off.

28:04.047 --> 28:06.925
My fishing trip is a bust
so l figured l’d come here...

28:07.087 --> 28:09.726
... and catch up on some paperwork
for the first time.

28:09.927 --> 28:11.645
- Well, that’s a shame.
- Aye, it is.

28:15.847 --> 28:17.678
- You all right ?
- A migraine.

28:17.847 --> 28:20.042
It’s a bad one, actually.
l took some stuff...

28:20.207 --> 28:23.165
... but l can’t take any more,
being the on-call and everything.

28:23.327 --> 28:25.795
- You should have radioed me.
- You kidding ?

28:25.967 --> 28:29.323
No way. You’ve been talking
about that fishing trip for two weeks.

28:30.207 --> 28:31.765
l’m not going now, so off you go.

28:31.967 --> 28:33.366
l’Il cover your shift.

28:33.527 --> 28:35.916
- You sure ?
- Aye, there’s nothing happening here.

28:36.087 --> 28:37.839
You go take a horse pill and rest.

28:38.047 --> 28:39.400
Oh, you’re a lifesaver.

28:39.607 --> 28:43.156
- l know.
- Thanks, Carson. Thanks.

28:43.327 --> 28:45.045
You’re welcome.

28:48.047 --> 28:51.881
If you’re going to play volleyball,
you’re going to need proper gym shoes.

28:52.047 --> 28:53.082
l know.

28:53.247 --> 28:56.159
l’ve put an order. It takes forever
to get things from Earth...

28:56.327 --> 28:58.795
... that aren’t vital to the success
of the missions.

28:58.967 --> 29:01.720
You, young lady, are vital
to the success of the missions...

29:01.927 --> 29:04.999
- ... so don’t play sports in sandals, okay ?
- Okay, doc.

29:05.207 --> 29:09.280
All right, we’re all done here.
We’Il fix you up some crutches and--

29:10.567 --> 29:12.922
Meyers, call in every nurse
and doctor immediately.

29:13.087 --> 29:16.124
You, grab two field kits and a couple
of stretchers and follow me.

29:16.287 --> 29:18.357
Beckett. What happened ?
Where do you need me ?

29:18.807 --> 29:20.604
- What happened here ?
- An explosion.

29:20.767 --> 29:22.758
At least three dead,
a dozen or so injured.

29:22.927 --> 29:24.485
Doc ?

29:27.167 --> 29:28.680
Teyla.

29:29.727 --> 29:31.240
- Carson.
- l’m here.

29:31.407 --> 29:34.604
You’ve been in an explosion.
A piece of debris has impacted your side.

29:34.807 --> 29:37.002
We’Il take it out and patch you up.

29:37.167 --> 29:39.840
Easy-peasy.
l can do this one in my sleep.

29:42.567 --> 29:43.556
All right, all set ?

29:43.767 --> 29:44.916
Thank you.

29:45.087 --> 29:46.918
Can’t believe you got
the artery cleaned.

29:47.127 --> 29:49.561
They don’t make you head surgeon
if you’re all thumbs.

29:50.127 --> 29:53.164
You have another patient waiting.
He got his leg cut up bad.

29:53.327 --> 29:56.080
We’re done here. Let’s get her
to recovery and get him in.

29:56.247 --> 29:57.362
- Okay.
- Long story short...

29:57.807 --> 29:59.365
... it creates explosive tumors.

29:59.527 --> 30:00.562
Explosive tumors ?

30:00.767 --> 30:02.519
- Are you kidding me ?
- l wish l was.

30:02.687 --> 30:05.440
- Wait. This guy Watson--
- Has been exposed.

30:05.607 --> 30:08.724
Find him before the tumor ignites,
which could be any minute now.

30:08.887 --> 30:11.481
It’s not good but not awful.
We need to start right away.

30:11.647 --> 30:12.762
What’s his name ?

30:12.967 --> 30:14.605
James, James Watson.

30:14.767 --> 30:16.166
Watson ?

30:16.327 --> 30:19.046
Poor lad was in here last night.
He’s had a run of bad luck.

30:19.207 --> 30:24.406
<i>Dr. Watson, Dr. James Watson,
report your whereabouts immediately.</i>

30:24.567 --> 30:27.877
Well, aren’t you popular ?
Go see what that’s about, please.

30:29.207 --> 30:30.799
He’s in the O.R. right now ?

30:30.967 --> 30:33.435
l need you to get Beckett
back on his radio.

30:33.647 --> 30:35.444
It’s Dr. McKay.

30:35.607 --> 30:37.996
<i>- What is it ? l’m a little busy right now.
-Carson.</i>

30:38.207 --> 30:41.085
The man has been infected
with an explosive tumor.

30:41.247 --> 30:43.044
<i>It killed Hewston,
caused the explosion.</i>

30:43.247 --> 30:46.603
<i>- What are you talking about ? That’s--
- It is possible, Carson.</i>

30:46.767 --> 30:48.997
You need to get you
and your team out of there.

30:49.167 --> 30:50.998
An ordnance disposal crew is
on the way.

30:51.207 --> 30:52.606
He’s too fragile to move now.

30:52.807 --> 30:55.446
He doesn’t have to move.
You do.

30:58.287 --> 31:00.960
Listen up. l need everyone
to clear the floor right now.

31:01.127 --> 31:03.357
l’m enacting a Protocol 7 for this level.

31:03.567 --> 31:05.558
Move it, people.
Right, he stays, you go.

31:05.727 --> 31:07.240
- What about you ?
- l’m staying put.

31:07.407 --> 31:09.159
- So am l.
- No time to fight about this.

31:09.327 --> 31:11.921
- You can’t do this on your own.
- Oh, God.

31:21.087 --> 31:23.840
Thank you. All right,
let’s get the scanner in place...

31:24.007 --> 31:26.157
... we have a tumor to remove.

31:28.007 --> 31:31.283
He’s used his authorization code
to seal off the whole level.

31:31.447 --> 31:32.482
We can’t get to him.

31:32.647 --> 31:35.957
Carson, you cannot seriously
be considering operating on this guy.

31:36.127 --> 31:37.719
Exactly how much time do l have ?

31:37.887 --> 31:39.559
<i>There is no way to know for sure.</i>

31:39.767 --> 31:43.476
Hewston was infected at the same time
that Watson was. Her tumor’s exploded.

31:45.007 --> 31:46.804
No time to waste, then.

31:47.007 --> 31:48.156
<i>making first incision.</i>

31:48.327 --> 31:50.318
Okay, this is all very brave
and all, but--

31:50.487 --> 31:52.637
What if the explosion
causes structural damage ?

31:52.807 --> 31:54.798
- What if the tower comes down ?
- Exactly.

31:54.967 --> 31:59.040
Sending him to the other side of the city
and leaving him is tantamount to murder.

31:59.207 --> 32:00.356
The man is already dead.

32:00.567 --> 32:02.319
<i>- Like hell he is.
-Carson.</i>

32:02.527 --> 32:05.724
<i>- l can’t order you to stand down, but--
- That’s right, you can’t.</i>

32:05.927 --> 32:07.155
Have your men standing by.

32:07.327 --> 32:09.795
l’Il open the access
once l’ve extracted the tumor.

32:10.007 --> 32:11.804
<i>Beckett out.</i>

32:17.727 --> 32:19.797
- How long has he been at it ?
- Ten minutes.

32:19.967 --> 32:22.527
Emergency crew’s standing by.
Either way, we’re covered.

32:22.727 --> 32:25.241
- Can’t you bypass his code ?
- That’Il take half an hour.

32:25.407 --> 32:28.240
- If he’s not done removing it by then--
- This is crazy.

32:51.567 --> 32:54.718
Colonel Sheppard,
l’ve extracted the tumor...

32:54.887 --> 32:57.481
... and l’m opening up the O.R. level.

33:11.847 --> 33:14.407
<i>He’s on his way. Sit tight.</i>

33:15.967 --> 33:20.279
<i>- Damn it. Tell him l’Il meet him half way.
-Just stay put, doc.</i>

33:20.847 --> 33:23.645
The sooner l get this thing out
of my sight, the better.

33:23.887 --> 33:26.321
You finish closing him up, please.

33:27.367 --> 33:29.164
l’Il be right back.

33:39.647 --> 33:43.356
Easy. Easy.

33:50.567 --> 33:52.398
Thank you.

33:53.287 --> 33:55.323
We just made the handoff.

34:21.847 --> 34:23.246
Hey.

34:23.567 --> 34:24.920
Hey.

34:27.087 --> 34:28.076
You okay ?

34:31.847 --> 34:32.835
Not really.

34:33.806 --> 34:35.559
- You need some help ?
- No.

34:35.766 --> 34:37.598
l’m almost done.

34:38.127 --> 34:40.357
He didn’t have a lot of stuff here.

34:40.766 --> 34:43.156
- You sending it all back to his family ?
- Yeah.

34:43.367 --> 34:45.039
Well, l mean, we--

34:45.367 --> 34:47.641
We will. They don’t know yet.

34:47.927 --> 34:50.121
We’re going to send...

34:50.687 --> 34:51.676
... the body...

34:51.887 --> 34:53.525
... back to Earth, and...

34:55.527 --> 34:57.563
l’m gonna tell his mother.

35:00.767 --> 35:03.122
- l should have just gone fishing with him.
- Don’t.

35:03.287 --> 35:05.357
No, if l’d gone fishing...

35:05.527 --> 35:08.644
... if l’d checked the machine,
hadn’t assigned junior guys--

35:08.807 --> 35:10.081
Rodney.

35:10.287 --> 35:12.084
What’s done is done.

35:12.287 --> 35:14.118
l know.

35:15.127 --> 35:16.765
And...

35:17.127 --> 35:19.118
... that’s what’s killing me.

35:33.367 --> 35:36.404
- Where do you think you’re going ?
- l’d like to go to the memorial.

35:36.567 --> 35:38.478
l don’t think you should be going
anywhere.

35:38.647 --> 35:40.365
l’m fine.

35:42.167 --> 35:43.600
All right.

35:43.767 --> 35:45.485
- l’Il get a wheelchair.
- No.

35:45.687 --> 35:49.202
l would like to stand.
As a testament to him.

35:51.247 --> 35:52.600
How are you doing ?

35:52.807 --> 35:54.081
Me ?

35:54.247 --> 35:57.603
Fine, but l didn’t get major surgery
two days ago.

35:57.767 --> 35:59.883
That is not what l meant.

36:01.247 --> 36:03.522
Well, it hasn’t hit me yet.

36:05.527 --> 36:08.325
l’m not looking forward to it
when it does.

36:09.367 --> 36:11.801
l feel a great sadness.

36:12.087 --> 36:13.440
He--

36:15.287 --> 36:17.437
l feel a great sadness.

36:21.727 --> 36:23.524
Yeah, l got you.

36:42.407 --> 36:45.399
We’ve said goodbye
to a lot of friends today.

36:47.127 --> 36:49.800
Our mission is a dangerous one.

36:50.327 --> 36:52.283
We lose people.

36:52.687 --> 36:56.475
A fact we’re all painfully aware of.

36:59.287 --> 37:01.482
But Carson was...

37:07.127 --> 37:10.563
l can’t remember anyone coming
to me with a complaint against him.

37:11.607 --> 37:13.120
Ever.

37:18.967 --> 37:21.197
He was a kind soul.

37:22.087 --> 37:23.725
He was...

37:26.487 --> 37:28.443
He was a healer...

37:29.567 --> 37:32.718
... and he will be very deeply missed.

37:34.407 --> 37:36.398
George Fabricius said :

37:37.287 --> 37:39.801
« Death comes to us all...

37:40.807 --> 37:43.116
... but great achievements...

37:43.927 --> 37:45.997
... they build a monument
which shall endure...

37:46.167 --> 37:47.885
... until the sun grows cold. »

37:50.567 --> 37:53.957
Every single life Carson saved...

37:54.527 --> 37:56.563
... is a monument to him.

37:59.847 --> 38:02.122
And that gives me great comfort.

39:38.007 --> 39:40.202
How’d it go back on Earth ?

39:41.167 --> 39:43.601
It was-- It was awful.

39:45.367 --> 39:47.562
Your family was amazing, though.

39:47.727 --> 39:49.763
Aye, they are. Good turnout ?

39:49.927 --> 39:50.996
Packed the church.

39:51.167 --> 39:53.522
Oh, that’s good to hear.

39:55.367 --> 39:57.358
It’s not gonna be the same here
without you.

39:57.567 --> 39:59.797
Oh, you’re telling me...

40:00.727 --> 40:02.240
You know...

Who knows ? Maybe we’Il...

40:06.767 --> 40:08.644
- ... bump into each other again.
- Aye.

Who knows ?

- Hey.

40:27.727 --> 40:29.638
This isn’t your fault.

40:30.647 --> 40:32.285
You’re telling me what l wanna hear.

Well, that’s what best friends do
sometimes.

40:35.687 --> 40:38.565
And in this case,
it also happens to be true.

40:46.847 --> 40:49.122
Take care of yourself, Rodney.

40:51.247 --> 40:52.999
