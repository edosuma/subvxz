00:08.530 --> 00:10.488
Previously on
Star Trek: Discovery...

00:10.532 --> 00:12.534
Emperor.You have me confused
with someone else.

00:12.577 --> 00:14.710
TYLER:
Section 31.

00:14.753 --> 00:16.190
Control values
his skill set.

00:16.233 --> 00:17.626
He's in.

00:17.669 --> 00:19.019
I've been waiting for an update
on my officer, Spock.

00:19.062 --> 00:20.803
Your guy is wanted for murder.

00:20.846 --> 00:23.371
He killed three of his doctors,
then fled the starbase.

00:23.414 --> 00:24.459
Whatever happened,
he needs a fair shake.

00:24.502 --> 00:25.677
We need to find him
before they do.

00:25.721 --> 00:27.027
BURNHAM:
I found Spock's shuttle.

00:27.070 --> 00:28.854
Plot a course
and don't spare the horses.

00:28.898 --> 00:31.727
TILLY: After the dark matter hit
me, I started to see a ghost.

00:31.770 --> 00:33.990
It's me. Silly Stilly.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.165
STAMETS:
You are hosting

00:35.209 --> 00:37.602
a multidimensional
fungal parasite.

00:37.646 --> 00:40.605
How do we get rid of it?This might hurt a bit.

00:43.608 --> 00:45.741
: I'm from a
species known as the JahSepp.

00:45.784 --> 00:48.787
An alien intruder began
ravaging our ecosystem.

00:48.831 --> 00:51.225
You let Tilly go.I have other plans for her.

00:51.268 --> 00:52.704
Wrong.

00:52.748 --> 00:54.924
No! No!

00:54.967 --> 00:56.143
Tilly!

00:59.363 --> 01:00.886
No!

01:20.515 --> 01:23.083
Make way!

01:34.877 --> 01:36.879
BURNHAM:
Words define who we are.

01:38.881 --> 01:40.448
Officer.

01:40.491 --> 01:43.538
Orphan.

01:43.581 --> 01:46.280
Widower.

01:51.285 --> 01:53.287
Shipmate.

02:00.642 --> 02:03.732
But there is no word
for the unique agony

02:03.775 --> 02:06.691
of uncertainty.

02:06.735 --> 02:11.261
I do not yet know
the fate of my friend.

02:14.699 --> 02:17.789
Stamets refuses to lose hope.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.617
He believes Tilly survived

02:19.661 --> 02:23.404
whatever the alien
we call "May" did to her.

02:23.447 --> 02:26.668
I want to believe
that's possible, too.

02:26.711 --> 02:28.713
I want to have faith.

02:31.281 --> 02:34.197
But in its absence,

02:34.241 --> 02:37.244
only duty remains.

02:56.828 --> 03:00.223
Captain, I've picked up the
trail of Spock's shuttle.

03:00.267 --> 03:02.704
Alter course
to intercept.

03:10.625 --> 03:12.888
Spock's shuttle is
25,000 kilometers and closing.

03:12.931 --> 03:14.629
One life sign detected.

03:14.672 --> 03:16.761
His shields are up and
his weapons are hot, sir.

03:16.805 --> 03:18.589
BURNHAM:
What is Spock doing?

03:18.633 --> 03:20.635
Why the aggressive stance?

03:20.678 --> 03:23.420
Uh, Captain,
Spock departed Enterprise

03:23.464 --> 03:26.380
before you assumed
command of Discovery.

03:26.423 --> 03:28.382
Perhaps he is unaware
that he's among friends.

03:28.425 --> 03:30.514
Open a channel.Aye, Captain.

03:30.558 --> 03:33.735
Lieutenant Spock,
this is Captain Pike.

03:33.778 --> 03:36.912
Shut down your engines,
lower your shields,

03:36.955 --> 03:39.567
prepare for transport.He's increasing speed.

03:39.610 --> 03:41.830
Altering course to
enter the nebula.

03:41.873 --> 03:44.746
Spock, you have my word.

03:44.789 --> 03:47.488
I'm here to listen.
I'm here to help.

03:58.063 --> 03:59.630
Did we lose him?No, sir.

03:59.674 --> 04:01.850
He ignited the nebula's hydrogen
to disrupt our sensors,

04:01.893 --> 04:03.547
then came
to a full stop.

04:03.591 --> 04:06.376
We flew right past him.Detmer, come around.

04:16.386 --> 04:19.911
Captain, if he enters
the nebula, we will lose him.

04:19.954 --> 04:22.087
Target that shuttle
with a class-five torpedo.

04:22.130 --> 04:24.133
Detonate it 100 meters
before impact. Understood?

04:24.176 --> 04:26.657
RHYS: Aye, Captain.Fire.

04:34.796 --> 04:37.189
The shuttle's been
disabled, sir.

04:38.626 --> 04:40.671
Owo, lock on a tractor beam
and bring him aboard.

04:40.715 --> 04:42.238
Burnham, with me.

04:51.378 --> 04:53.380
WOMAN :
Transfer operational control

04:53.423 --> 04:55.860
to security team alpha.

04:55.904 --> 04:57.340
Set phasers to stun.WOMAN: Aye.

04:57.384 --> 04:59.037
Nobody fires without
my direct order.MAN: Aye, sir.

05:26.238 --> 05:28.066
Captain Georgiou?

05:31.113 --> 05:34.725
Captain Pike.

05:34.769 --> 05:36.074
Michael.

05:37.772 --> 05:39.339
Commander.

05:43.299 --> 05:45.257
Quite the welcome, my dear.

07:31.929 --> 07:33.757
We met at
the Academy.

07:33.801 --> 07:35.585
Been a couple thousand
light-years since then.

07:35.629 --> 07:36.847
Indeed.

07:36.891 --> 07:38.762
You were a force to
be reckoned with.

07:38.806 --> 07:40.677
Sharpest tool
in the shed.

07:40.721 --> 07:43.463
And despite being able to drink
any of us under the table,

07:43.506 --> 07:45.595
you had every regulation
down by week two.

07:45.639 --> 07:47.031
You're tactfully asking

07:47.075 --> 07:49.599
why I didn't identify myself
when you hailed.

07:49.643 --> 07:50.905
PIKE:
Identification is

07:50.948 --> 07:52.559
standard procedure,
and that's a non-answer.

07:52.602 --> 07:54.778
You haven't
lost a step, Captain.

07:54.822 --> 07:56.563
I appreciate
the compliment.

07:56.606 --> 07:59.522
Starfleet records show...
you're retired.

07:59.566 --> 08:01.045
Do I look retired?

08:01.089 --> 08:02.482
You know, I had
a cousin like you.

08:02.525 --> 08:05.310
She only ever gave a
straight answer in church.

08:05.354 --> 08:06.877
So the only other
explanation is

08:06.921 --> 08:09.967
you're on a
classified mission.

08:10.011 --> 08:11.099
Hmm.

08:11.142 --> 08:13.275
You like being
back in the saddle?

08:13.318 --> 08:16.321
It's an invigorating ride.

08:27.811 --> 08:30.118
This may clear
things up, Captain.

08:32.250 --> 08:33.904
Section 31?
Fancy.

08:33.948 --> 08:36.602
Covert ops. Intelligence
gathering. Threat assessment.

08:36.645 --> 08:38.692
Fun times.What do any
of those things

08:38.735 --> 08:40.563
have to do with you
being on Spock's shuttle?

08:40.607 --> 08:43.566
I've been authorized
to hunt down a Starfleet officer

08:43.610 --> 08:44.785
wanted for murder.

08:44.828 --> 08:46.308
Excuse me,

08:46.351 --> 08:47.831
multiple murders.

08:47.875 --> 08:50.530
By the time I caught up
to his craft,

08:50.573 --> 08:52.793
it was adrift,
and he was gone.

08:52.836 --> 08:54.925
Any idea where
he might be?

08:54.969 --> 08:57.928
If I hear anything, you'll
be the first to know.

08:57.972 --> 08:59.364
Will I?

08:59.408 --> 09:00.931
PIKE: Commander Burnham
has a hard time

09:00.975 --> 09:02.803
believing those charges;
so do I.

09:02.846 --> 09:05.327
The innocent don't run.You ran from us.

09:05.370 --> 09:06.458
Exactly.

09:11.159 --> 09:13.683
LELAND:
Christopher.

09:13.727 --> 09:14.989
Leland.

09:15.032 --> 09:17.426
Is that gray hair I see?

09:17.469 --> 09:18.819
Yeah, well,
it's one of the trade-offs

09:18.862 --> 09:19.863
of having actual hair.

09:19.907 --> 09:20.864
Last time I
heard about you,

09:20.908 --> 09:22.213
you were up to your ass

09:22.257 --> 09:23.693
in alligators on Cestus Three.

09:23.737 --> 09:25.913
Exactly why I transferred
to Starfleet Intelligence.

09:25.956 --> 09:27.567
I'm heading up Section 31.

09:27.610 --> 09:28.959
Well, you were always
more comfortable

09:29.003 --> 09:30.308
in the gray areas, my friend.

09:30.352 --> 09:33.964
Seems you've intercepted
one of my agents.

09:35.662 --> 09:38.273
Yeah, we've been
getting caught up.

09:38.316 --> 09:39.491
Well, I'd appreciate
if you'd return

09:39.535 --> 09:40.580
Agent Georgiou to her shuttle.

09:40.623 --> 09:42.016
Clock is ticking.

09:42.059 --> 09:44.671
She's tracking
a suspected murderer.

09:45.715 --> 09:47.064
PIKE: Mr. Spock
is one of mine.

09:47.108 --> 09:49.937
I can't reconcile
the charges with the man.

09:49.980 --> 09:51.460
I respect that.

09:51.503 --> 09:53.897
But having his commanding
officer or his sister

09:53.941 --> 09:55.943
interfere with our
efforts to recover him?

09:55.986 --> 09:58.423
Makes me look like
I'm doing an old friend a favor.

10:00.382 --> 10:02.384
Leland, um,

10:02.427 --> 10:04.778
I think there may be
a connection

10:04.821 --> 10:07.041
between Spock and the signals
that have been dragging us

10:07.084 --> 10:08.782
halfway around
the universe.

10:08.825 --> 10:10.653
There are lives at stake.

10:10.697 --> 10:13.961
There are always lives at stake.
That's what keeps us employed.

10:14.004 --> 10:15.919
See, we do what we do

10:15.963 --> 10:18.400
so you can do what you do.

10:18.443 --> 10:20.532
PIKE: If I didn't
know you better,

10:20.576 --> 10:23.753
that would sound like a threat.

10:23.797 --> 10:26.321
You know me pretty well.

10:27.975 --> 10:29.716
I'll send a liaison.

10:29.759 --> 10:32.632
If you could walk him
through what you know,

10:32.675 --> 10:33.981
I'd appreciate it.

10:34.024 --> 10:36.679
Always happy to do a favor
for an old friend.

10:36.723 --> 10:39.639
You're free to go, Captain.

10:52.042 --> 10:55.045
Your captain doesn't know
where I'm really from.

10:55.089 --> 10:56.568
I'm under direct
Starfleet orders.

10:56.612 --> 10:58.658
Yeah, to tell the truth
when it's convenient?

10:58.701 --> 11:02.139
I'm learning to really like
Starfleet and Section 31.

11:02.183 --> 11:05.447
Do you think they'll
give you free reign, huh?

11:05.490 --> 11:08.102
That place has eyes
on eyes on eyes.

11:08.145 --> 11:11.018
Well, it's a good thing
I do some of my best work

11:11.061 --> 11:12.541
in plain sight.

11:12.584 --> 11:15.631
Does Leland have any idea
who you really are?

11:15.675 --> 11:16.980
You mean the Terran Emperor,

11:17.024 --> 11:19.330
Philippa Georgiou
Augustus Iaponius Centarius?

11:19.374 --> 11:20.897
He doesn't call me

11:20.941 --> 11:23.639
by my proper name,
but yes, he does.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.249
Then I trust him
about as much as I trust you.

11:25.293 --> 11:28.209
You're the one who brought me
to this insufferable place.

11:28.252 --> 11:31.125
You don't get to be
surprised I'm here.

11:31.168 --> 11:35.564
And when I find Spock, I'll be
sure to pass along your regards.

11:37.566 --> 11:41.483
If you lay a hand
on my brother...

11:41.526 --> 11:43.224
You'll what?

11:43.267 --> 11:45.139
Ah.

11:45.182 --> 11:48.751
Now here's a woman I recognize.

11:48.795 --> 11:51.319
Shuttle bay's through there.

11:51.362 --> 11:55.540
I'm sure you need to get back
to your... snake pit.

12:04.114 --> 12:05.376
Tell me you have good news.

12:05.420 --> 12:09.206
The universe never lets
anything go to waste,

12:09.250 --> 12:10.773
or so said Lavoisier.

12:10.817 --> 12:13.080
The law of conservation of mass.Yes.

12:13.123 --> 12:14.255
In chemical reactions,

12:14.298 --> 12:17.084
mass is neither created
nor destroyed.

12:17.127 --> 12:19.216
Look. Look, look, look.

12:19.260 --> 12:22.045
I'm scanning the cocoon
for human remains.

12:22.089 --> 12:25.092
Mitochondrial DNA,
lipids, proteins.

12:25.135 --> 12:27.007
If all of Tilly's atoms

12:27.050 --> 12:28.791
were transported,

12:28.835 --> 12:30.445
rather than decomposed,

12:30.488 --> 12:34.188
then there shouldn't be any
trace of her organic matter.

12:34.231 --> 12:36.190
Which would mean May took Tilly
into the network.

12:36.233 --> 12:37.452
Which would mean

12:37.495 --> 12:39.062
we could get her out.

12:39.106 --> 12:40.455
How?

12:40.498 --> 12:44.067
I think that this cocoon
is an organic transporter.

12:44.111 --> 12:45.416
Just like ours,

12:45.460 --> 12:47.288
it-it breaks down
matter in one place

12:47.331 --> 12:49.856
and then reassembles it,
completely intact, in another.

12:49.899 --> 12:51.988
The mycelial version
of a transporter pad.

12:52.032 --> 12:53.816
Which could mean
that a second cocoon

12:53.860 --> 12:56.514
just like this one
exists somewhere in the network.

12:58.516 --> 13:01.258
But why take Tilly
in the first place?

13:01.302 --> 13:03.521
May came here to deliver
a message to you.

13:03.565 --> 13:06.176
May said she had
a special connection with Tilly.

13:06.220 --> 13:07.917
She said she needed her.

13:11.225 --> 13:13.140
STAMETS:
Look.

13:15.359 --> 13:17.492
No human material present.

13:19.363 --> 13:21.322
Tilly's alive.
I know it.

13:21.365 --> 13:23.585
But the network is massive.Yes.

13:23.628 --> 13:27.371
Except now that I know the exact
composition of this cocoon,

13:27.415 --> 13:29.721
I can scan the network
to find its counterpart.

13:29.765 --> 13:32.028
Find it, find Tilly.

13:49.393 --> 13:51.221
Help me! Help me!

13:55.008 --> 13:56.531
Oh, no!

13:56.574 --> 13:58.925
Shh, shh, shh.Get it off! Get it off!
Get it off!

13:58.968 --> 14:01.579
Shh, shh, shh, shh.Ow! My eyes! My eyes!

14:01.623 --> 14:02.929
Stay calm, Tilly.

14:02.972 --> 14:05.975
You're okay.Don't you...
don't you shush me!

14:06.019 --> 14:08.891
What the hell did you do?
What did you do?

14:08.935 --> 14:11.154
Broke down your biological
form, transported it

14:11.198 --> 14:12.895
across the
dimensional plane,

14:12.939 --> 14:15.637
and reconstituted it
here, in my home.

14:15.680 --> 14:18.988
Oh, that old trick!
Are you freaking kidding me?!

14:25.560 --> 14:27.692
I'm in the mycelial network.

14:29.694 --> 14:31.871
It used to be a paradise.

14:42.577 --> 14:44.709
No!

14:44.753 --> 14:46.929
This is the one
I was telling you about!

14:46.973 --> 14:48.322
Ow, it burns! It burns.

14:48.365 --> 14:49.932
Leave her!

14:51.455 --> 14:52.413
It's our process.

14:52.456 --> 14:54.154
What does that mean?

14:54.197 --> 14:56.939
The JahSepp-- we
break down all matter

14:56.983 --> 15:00.116
that enter the mycelial network
to make it useful in new ways.

15:00.160 --> 15:02.292
Like the insects
do on your planet.

15:02.336 --> 15:04.468
It's how we keep the
life cycle progressing.

15:04.512 --> 15:06.906
This was you
before you were you.

15:06.949 --> 15:08.472
That's what I am.

15:08.516 --> 15:11.388
I'm appearing like this
to make you comfortable.

15:11.432 --> 15:14.217
Comfortable?
You kidnapped me!

15:14.261 --> 15:16.959
And I'm finding
my way back!
You can't.

15:17.003 --> 15:19.396
Watch me! Watch me!

15:19.440 --> 15:22.922
And when I'm done, I'm not
gonna work through my anger.

15:22.965 --> 15:26.099
I'm gonna let it sit there
and fester for eternity!

15:26.142 --> 15:27.709
Please. I need your help.

15:27.752 --> 15:29.798
You don't get to ask
for my help, May.

15:29.841 --> 15:32.322
Then who are
we to turn to?

15:32.366 --> 15:35.325
Who am I to turn to besides you?

15:35.369 --> 15:37.197
There's no one, Tilly.

15:37.240 --> 15:40.287
And I can't fail,
or everything here,

15:40.330 --> 15:42.680
my entire species, will die.

15:49.644 --> 15:51.733
What do you need me to do?

15:51.776 --> 15:53.953
Kill a monster.

16:01.351 --> 16:05.312
Burnham. Section 31's
liaison just got here.

16:05.355 --> 16:07.314
WOMAN :
Attention all personnel.

16:07.357 --> 16:11.231
Security drill in progress,
deck four.

16:16.279 --> 16:17.498
Burnham?

16:18.934 --> 16:20.327
It's nothing, sir.

16:20.370 --> 16:23.547
He's, um...

16:23.591 --> 16:26.246
he's-he's just supposed
to be on Qo'noS.

16:26.289 --> 16:28.291
He murdered an officer.

16:28.335 --> 16:30.554
Voq murdered an officer.

16:30.598 --> 16:32.208
Ash Tyler's a good man.

16:32.252 --> 16:34.471
Even if I could see
my way to accepting

16:34.515 --> 16:36.865
that distinction,
he left this ship

16:36.908 --> 16:39.259
to serve as Torchbearer
for the Klingon chancellor.

16:39.302 --> 16:41.261
Now he's into black ops.

16:41.304 --> 16:43.567
I know Tyler.

16:43.611 --> 16:45.569
Better than most.

16:45.613 --> 16:48.137
Just like you knew
your former captain?

16:48.181 --> 16:50.357
She certainly
doesn't seem like

16:50.400 --> 16:51.488
the Philippa Georgiou
I remember.

16:51.532 --> 16:54.100
The war changed her.

16:54.143 --> 16:57.277
Call me provincial,
but I prefer people

16:57.320 --> 16:59.496
whose truth I can take
at face value.

16:59.540 --> 17:01.281
So...

17:01.324 --> 17:03.283
what truth are you
keeping from me?

17:03.326 --> 17:04.284
Sir?

17:04.327 --> 17:06.721
That moment you saw Tyler,

17:06.763 --> 17:09.854
the moment that you had
your phaser on Georgiou.

17:09.897 --> 17:12.031
I don't know you very well,
but I know you well enough.

17:16.296 --> 17:18.863
: It's a longer
conversation, Captain.

17:18.906 --> 17:21.257
But I ask that
you bear with me

17:21.300 --> 17:24.260
until a more appropriate time.

17:24.304 --> 17:26.001
Done.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.612
Just don't make me chase
after you for the information.

17:28.656 --> 17:29.874
Thank you, sir.

17:56.727 --> 17:57.989
It's good to see you.

17:58.033 --> 18:00.079
I feel the same.

18:01.689 --> 18:04.300
Not sure shedoes.

18:08.304 --> 18:11.090
Your captain thinks
I need a babysitter.

18:11.133 --> 18:13.266
She's our new chief of security.

18:13.309 --> 18:15.094
It's her job
to be curious.

18:17.487 --> 18:20.664
How the hell did you end up
with Section 31?

18:20.708 --> 18:22.536
It's a very interesting
journey, actually.

18:22.579 --> 18:24.973
Tell me.But it's classified--
a word that pops up

18:25.016 --> 18:26.714
pretty frequently
in my new vocabulary.

18:28.716 --> 18:31.153
You always were
a man of secrets.

18:31.197 --> 18:33.764
Michael.

18:33.808 --> 18:37.159
I had to leave Qo'noS.
I'm never going back.

18:39.074 --> 18:41.729
I think... everyone at 31
thinks of it

18:41.772 --> 18:43.687
as a place
where they make sense.

18:43.731 --> 18:45.733
Not in spite of who they are
but because of it.

18:45.776 --> 18:47.909
They can be of service.
They're good people.

18:47.952 --> 18:49.867
Like the Terran emperor?

18:51.652 --> 18:53.915
I'm concerned for Spock's safety
as long as she's involved.

18:53.958 --> 18:56.613
I won't let that happen.

18:56.657 --> 18:58.615
I need you to believe that.

18:58.659 --> 19:00.269
That's a really big ask, Ash.

19:00.313 --> 19:01.966
I know.

19:07.102 --> 19:08.408
I'm supposed to report
to the bridge.

19:08.451 --> 19:11.106
Stamets is briefing us
on a plan to rescue Tilly.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.021
Rescue Tilly from where?

19:16.155 --> 19:19.027
Whoa. Whoa,
what happened here?

19:19.070 --> 19:22.073
The creature destroys
everything it touches.

19:22.117 --> 19:25.076
Wait, wait,
when did you first see it?

19:25.120 --> 19:28.732
It arrived when your Stamets
opened the door to our world.

19:28.776 --> 19:29.733
Doesn't make any sense.

19:29.777 --> 19:31.605
No, careful!

19:31.648 --> 19:33.955
The tree bark contains
a vicious toxin.

19:33.998 --> 19:35.870
It's lethal for us.

19:35.913 --> 19:38.264
Thank you.

19:38.307 --> 19:42.093
The creature uses the toxin
to slaughter us.

19:42.137 --> 19:43.747
We have no tools

19:43.791 --> 19:45.227
or weapons to
defend ourselves.

19:45.271 --> 19:47.011
Well, you're far
from helpless, May.

19:47.055 --> 19:49.057
The way you and I, uh--

19:49.100 --> 19:51.625
I guess "met" is a funny word--
but it's some of

19:51.668 --> 19:53.235
the most sophisticated science
I've ever seen.

19:53.279 --> 19:56.195
I mean, you literally
entered my brain as a spore.

19:57.283 --> 19:59.198
Thank you.

19:59.241 --> 20:02.157
I appreciate your mastery
of science as well.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.986
Let's go see
what we're dealing with.

20:05.029 --> 20:06.466
But you...
you have to promise me

20:06.509 --> 20:08.903
that you will get me
back on Discovery.

20:08.946 --> 20:11.732
It's a little hard
to dive into this

20:11.775 --> 20:13.516
knowing you plan on
holding me hostage forever.

20:19.696 --> 20:22.525
There's a chance
Ensign Tilly is still alive?

20:22.569 --> 20:23.744
There is, sir.

20:23.787 --> 20:25.572
She was taken
into the mycelial network

20:25.615 --> 20:26.834
against her will.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.192
How do we get her back,
Mr. Stamets?

20:37.236 --> 20:40.326
Every time we jump,

20:40.369 --> 20:43.329
Discoverypasses through
the mycelial network for...

20:43.372 --> 20:45.113
a few milliseconds,

20:45.156 --> 20:47.158
and during that
very brief window of time,

20:47.202 --> 20:49.160
we are actually inside it.

20:49.204 --> 20:50.597
I'm proposing we do

20:50.640 --> 20:52.076
a partial jump.

20:52.120 --> 20:55.123
A predetermined course
with no set end point?Exactly.

20:55.166 --> 20:57.821
Half in, half out
of the network.

20:57.865 --> 20:59.475
Discoverywill hold
position long enough

20:59.519 --> 21:01.608
for me to leave the cube
and find Tilly.

21:01.651 --> 21:03.044
BURNHAM:
For us

21:03.087 --> 21:04.263
to leave the cube.

21:04.306 --> 21:06.090
You're not gonna do this alone.

21:07.353 --> 21:09.746
Let's say I let you
use this ship as a doorstop.

21:09.790 --> 21:12.706
Can we survive prolonged
exposure to the network?

21:12.749 --> 21:15.622
The mycelia
will attack the ship,

21:15.665 --> 21:18.451
decomposing it
as soon as we enter,

21:18.494 --> 21:20.931
but tritanium is not
their favorite food,

21:20.975 --> 21:23.064
so we'll have about an hour

21:23.107 --> 21:25.240
before they
eat through the hull.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.460
That's an hour
to find Ensign Tilly.

21:27.503 --> 21:29.592
So far, I hate this plan.

21:29.636 --> 21:31.202
It'll be critical

21:31.246 --> 21:33.901
for everyone
to avoid places on the ship

21:33.944 --> 21:37.034
where mycelial space
and normal space intersect.

21:37.078 --> 21:40.037
Anyone who touches the barrier
will find themselves

21:40.081 --> 21:43.258
twisted around the axes
of both environments.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.042
Like the bodies we found

21:45.086 --> 21:47.001
on the Glenn.

21:48.307 --> 21:51.919
From what I know
of that young woman...

21:51.962 --> 21:54.704
she'd put her life on the line
for any one of us.

21:54.748 --> 21:57.098
That she would, sir.In a heartbeat.

21:59.100 --> 22:01.102
Bryce. Open a
ship-wide channel.

22:04.584 --> 22:08.457
All personnel,
this is Captain Pike.

22:08.501 --> 22:12.156
Starfleet... is a promise.

22:12.200 --> 22:16.160
I give my life for you;
you give your life for me.

22:16.204 --> 22:19.207
And nobody gets
left behind.

22:19.250 --> 22:21.514
Ensign Sylvia Tilly
is out there,

22:21.557 --> 22:24.430
and she has every right
to expect us.

22:24.473 --> 22:26.345
We keep our promises.

22:26.388 --> 22:28.347
This way! Quickly!

22:28.390 --> 22:30.436
Move, move! Move!PIKE :
Please report to your stations

22:30.479 --> 22:33.395
in designated safe zones
in the starboard section.

22:33.439 --> 22:34.396
Let's go, let's go!

22:34.440 --> 22:36.398
Good luck,

22:36.442 --> 22:38.313
and Godspeed to us all.

22:40.010 --> 22:41.969
Commander Saru modified these

22:42.012 --> 22:45.189
to maintain communication
with the bridge.

22:45.233 --> 22:47.670
They now have special filters
to limit interference.

22:52.458 --> 22:54.198
The reaction cube is

22:54.242 --> 22:56.636
the only place on the
ship where it's safe

22:56.679 --> 22:58.594
to contact the
mycelial barrier.

23:05.035 --> 23:06.602
PIKE :
Stamets,

23:06.646 --> 23:08.648
are you ready to execute
this very bold,

23:08.691 --> 23:10.432
deeply insane plan of yours?

23:10.476 --> 23:14.741
"Execute" might not have been my
choice of words, but...

23:14.784 --> 23:16.133
that I am, sir.

23:16.177 --> 23:17.396
Black alert.

23:17.439 --> 23:18.962
Let's jump.

23:32.454 --> 23:34.151
What's happening?

23:34.195 --> 23:35.196
I don't know!

23:42.029 --> 23:43.683
That's probably for me.

23:50.298 --> 23:52.256
MAY:
More havoc in my home.

23:52.300 --> 23:53.823
The JahSepp have
never encountered

23:53.867 --> 23:54.998
mass like this.

23:55.042 --> 23:56.957
Please assure them,
this isn't an attack.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.698
I won't assure
them of anything.

23:58.741 --> 24:00.308
I don't know
the humans on that ship.

24:00.351 --> 24:03.703
But I do. And you know me.
You've been inside my head.

24:03.746 --> 24:05.487
Trust me, we have
a much better chance

24:05.531 --> 24:07.315
of defeating this thing
with what's on board.

24:15.279 --> 24:17.456
You won't abandon us?

24:20.371 --> 24:22.243
What are you doing
with your tiny finger?

24:22.286 --> 24:25.202
It's, um... Just...

24:27.335 --> 24:28.858
Pinky swear.

24:30.294 --> 24:32.383
I told you
I would try to help you.

24:32.427 --> 24:34.473
Where I come from,
we keep our promises.

24:40.914 --> 24:41.958
We have to hurry.

24:55.450 --> 24:57.496
Wow.

24:57.539 --> 24:59.976
It worked.

25:00.020 --> 25:02.413
BURNHAM :
Burnham to Commander Saru,
do you read me?

25:02.457 --> 25:04.459
SARU: I'm here, Burnham.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.896
Uh, the sensors show
the mycelium

25:06.940 --> 25:08.550
have already begun
to attack the hull.

25:08.594 --> 25:11.074
Move quickly.

25:12.467 --> 25:14.251
Ready?

25:22.651 --> 25:25.524
Hello?

25:27.656 --> 25:31.094
Computer, report life signs.

25:34.533 --> 25:35.664
Damn it, where is everybody?

25:37.492 --> 25:38.972
Maybe they died
trying to save you.

25:39.015 --> 25:40.539
Hey, thanks for that.

25:49.373 --> 25:51.462
What was that?

25:51.506 --> 25:53.508
The JahSepp have already started
breaking down the hull.

26:00.167 --> 26:03.474
The monster has come here.Why did it board the ship?

26:03.518 --> 26:05.389
It pursues Discoveryevery time
you fly through the network.

26:05.433 --> 26:08.044
Whatever it's doing,

26:08.088 --> 26:11.221
I'm not letting it
terrorize my people.

26:11.265 --> 26:12.614
They're my family.

26:12.658 --> 26:14.616
Exactly.

26:29.022 --> 26:30.676
Fall in.

26:30.719 --> 26:32.591
That's soldier for
"Get behind me."

26:38.553 --> 26:41.730
I'm reading a
human life sign.

26:43.036 --> 26:44.951
Section 14,
weapons storage.

26:44.994 --> 26:47.518
Why is Tilly arming herself?

26:51.784 --> 26:55.135
Whatever you are, I'm holding
a type-three phaser rifle.

26:55.178 --> 26:57.267
It is more powerful

26:57.311 --> 26:59.530
and generally larger than
the type-one or type-two.

26:59.574 --> 27:02.185
Uh, which I guess is
why they call it a three.

27:02.229 --> 27:03.709
BURNHAM:
Tilly?

27:03.752 --> 27:06.494
Tilly.

27:06.537 --> 27:08.583
Michael?Is that May?

27:08.627 --> 27:10.890
Tilly, get down.No, it's not what you think.

27:10.933 --> 27:12.674
She needs our help.

27:15.111 --> 27:16.722
Are you...?

27:16.765 --> 27:18.506
It's me. It's me.

27:18.549 --> 27:19.725
I'm okay. I'm fine.

27:19.768 --> 27:22.336
Thank you for
coming to get me.

27:22.379 --> 27:24.120
BURNHAM:
Always.

27:24.164 --> 27:26.035
STAMETS:
Restored to one piece,

27:26.079 --> 27:27.733
atom by atom.

27:27.776 --> 27:29.299
We're getting
you out of here.

27:29.343 --> 27:30.692
We have less than an
hour before Discovery's

27:30.736 --> 27:32.912
irreparably compromised;
we need to go.

27:32.955 --> 27:35.654
"Compromised"?
We'll be annihilated.

27:36.524 --> 27:37.699
I told her I would stay.

27:37.743 --> 27:38.961
There's-there's some sort
of predator...

27:39.005 --> 27:40.571
A monster!A monster that is,

27:40.615 --> 27:42.965
that is in the network, and
it's killing off her species.

27:51.321 --> 27:52.845
Behind me.

27:52.888 --> 27:57.153
This monster, May--
what can you tell us about it?

27:57.197 --> 27:59.329
It started as a surge
of unknown energy.

27:59.373 --> 28:01.723
We began to reconstitute it,

28:01.767 --> 28:05.553
but it became this creature
out of our control.

28:05.596 --> 28:06.859
Its skin

28:06.902 --> 28:07.990
is indestructible.

28:08.034 --> 28:10.123
We die when we try
to break it down.

28:10.166 --> 28:11.646
Wonderful.

28:23.571 --> 28:25.399
Hugh?

28:31.492 --> 28:33.363
But he died.

28:36.018 --> 28:37.585
This isn't real.

28:37.628 --> 28:39.195
I thought I imagined
seeing him.

28:39.239 --> 28:40.806
Stay away!

28:40.849 --> 28:42.198
Is this some
mycelial manifestation?

28:42.242 --> 28:45.854
Have you, have you created this
from my memories...?

28:45.898 --> 28:46.986
He's real!

28:47.029 --> 28:49.292
What?

28:49.336 --> 28:50.729
Kill it.

28:51.860 --> 28:54.515
Stand down, May.Kill it. Kill it!

28:54.558 --> 28:57.083
Kill it! Kill it!
Kill it! You promised!

28:58.432 --> 29:00.216
Wait!

29:00.260 --> 29:02.349
You let it go!

29:02.392 --> 29:05.004
Burnham to the bridge.

29:05.047 --> 29:06.701
We found Tilly.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.616
How soon can you get back?

29:08.659 --> 29:10.879
There's been a complication.

29:10.923 --> 29:12.533
We won't survive complications,
Commander.

29:14.535 --> 29:16.537
I know.

29:16.580 --> 29:18.626
But something resembling
Dr. Culber is here.

29:26.939 --> 29:29.550
Repeat that, Commander.BURNHAM: Dr. Culber.

29:29.593 --> 29:32.814
Remember? Before you
came aboard, he...PIKE: I know who he was.

29:32.858 --> 29:35.121
I need you to make it
make sense.BURNHAM: I can't.

29:35.164 --> 29:37.079
Commander Stamets
went running...

29:39.386 --> 29:40.779
Commander Burnham?

29:41.997 --> 29:42.911
Michael?

29:44.783 --> 29:48.134
Mr. Saru?I am working on it, Captain.

29:48.177 --> 29:51.877
What if it is the
real Dr. Culber?

29:51.920 --> 29:54.967
Nothing in the known universe
would make that possible.

29:55.010 --> 29:56.229
Yourknown universe.

29:56.272 --> 29:58.013
Dr. Culber was a healer.

29:58.057 --> 30:00.059
He would never harm
any living being.

30:00.102 --> 30:03.149
MAY: You refuse to see
what's right in front of you.

30:04.846 --> 30:06.805
Look.

30:07.980 --> 30:09.851
BURNHAM:
What is this?

30:09.895 --> 30:13.072
Bark from the yeel tree.

30:13.115 --> 30:14.769
It's deadly to us.

30:14.813 --> 30:17.250
This was all over him.

30:17.293 --> 30:19.600
He uses it to attack us.

30:21.950 --> 30:24.866
He...

30:24.910 --> 30:27.477
He's not using it to attack.

30:27.521 --> 30:29.697
He's using it to defend himself.

30:29.740 --> 30:31.133
Like armor.

30:31.177 --> 30:33.005
Which would give him
motivational

30:33.048 --> 30:34.397
and intentional thought.

30:34.441 --> 30:38.706
Which means... he is alive.

30:56.506 --> 30:58.987
Burnham, can you hear me?BURNHAM: Yes, Commander Saru.

30:59.031 --> 31:00.771
I hate to rush you,

31:00.815 --> 31:04.123
but mycelia have penetrated
78% of the exposed hull,

31:04.166 --> 31:06.125
and that number
is rising quickly.

31:06.168 --> 31:08.170
We're trying to locate Commander
Stamets and Dr. Culber.

31:20.530 --> 31:22.184
BURNHAM:
What's happening?

31:22.228 --> 31:23.969
Do not worry about us.
Just hurry.

31:30.105 --> 31:33.108
Red alert! Transfer helm control
to Airiam's station.

31:33.152 --> 31:35.545
The hull of the port nacelle
is too compromised.

31:35.589 --> 31:37.547
I need you to hold her together
under thrust.

31:37.591 --> 31:38.897
TYLER:
This is Agent Tyler

31:38.940 --> 31:39.941
transmitting on
secure emergency channel.

31:39.985 --> 31:41.421
Control, do you read?

31:41.464 --> 31:42.988
What the hell kind of
communicator is that?

31:43.031 --> 31:44.641
LELAND :
Copy, Agent Tyler. Status?

31:44.685 --> 31:46.121
Discoverycould use
an assist, sir.

31:46.165 --> 31:48.167
Say no more.

32:03.704 --> 32:06.098
Explain that to me.

32:06.141 --> 32:07.577
Is that Leland?

32:07.621 --> 32:10.058
Not his call, Chris.
We're standing by to assist.

32:10.102 --> 32:12.147
I don't know what the hell
took you so long,

32:12.191 --> 32:15.150
but we'll talk about that later,
at length.

32:17.239 --> 32:18.849
Can you stabilize us
with your tractor beam?

32:18.893 --> 32:21.156
Firing in three....

32:21.200 --> 32:23.376
two... one.

32:40.045 --> 32:41.829
Five minutes.

32:41.872 --> 32:43.439
If this goes south,
I'm pulling Discoveryout.

32:43.483 --> 32:46.573
That's not your call.You have one of my agents.

32:46.616 --> 32:48.270
Captain Leland, please don't
risk the Discoverycrew for...

32:48.314 --> 32:51.012
On my bridge, you will speak
only when addressed, Tyler.

32:51.056 --> 32:53.841
And, Leland, my ship, my call.

32:53.884 --> 32:55.886
You will hold
until I give the order.

32:55.930 --> 32:57.671
Are we clear?LELAND: My engines are
about to overload.

32:57.714 --> 33:00.195
We won't be able
to hold for long, Chris.

33:15.950 --> 33:17.386
You're not real.

33:17.430 --> 33:20.172
I am.

33:20.215 --> 33:23.131
W-When I was lost here,
you found me.

33:23.175 --> 33:24.959
Do you remember?

33:25.003 --> 33:28.180
You found me
in so many places.

33:28.223 --> 33:32.749
You took me to
the Metropolitan Museum of Art,

33:32.793 --> 33:34.708
when we were on leave.

33:34.751 --> 33:36.318
It was our third date.

33:36.362 --> 33:38.277
And-and you were
walking so fast

33:38.320 --> 33:41.280
because you were excited
to show me the de Koonings.

33:41.323 --> 33:43.586
All of them in one room.

33:43.630 --> 33:46.154
I had to run to keep up.

33:46.198 --> 33:49.331
And as you walked, you held out
your hand behind you

33:49.375 --> 33:51.986
because you knew
that I would grab it.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.422
And I did.

33:53.466 --> 33:57.078
And I knew everything
about you in that moment.

33:57.122 --> 33:59.863
And I'm here now.

34:05.869 --> 34:07.828
And here's my hand.

34:19.187 --> 34:21.842
I thought I was
losing my mind.

34:23.931 --> 34:26.150
Dr. Culber?

34:30.851 --> 34:33.549
Oh, no. May, no.
Oh, no.

34:33.592 --> 34:35.551
Don't, please.
Don't do this.

34:35.594 --> 34:38.685
Hey. Hey. May.
May, put it down.

34:38.728 --> 34:40.295
I told you,

34:40.339 --> 34:41.818
he's killing us.

34:41.862 --> 34:43.385
May, look at him.

34:44.777 --> 34:48.042
He's-he's trying
to protect himself.

34:48.085 --> 34:49.304
CULBER:
It burns.

34:49.348 --> 34:51.219
Everywhere they land on me.

34:51.263 --> 34:53.482
TILLY:
May, you see him?

34:53.525 --> 34:55.789
To him, you're the monster.

34:58.400 --> 34:59.401
This is not who you are.

35:00.837 --> 35:02.187
If you kill him,

35:02.230 --> 35:03.884
it will ruin you.

35:08.976 --> 35:10.195
Can I?

35:23.425 --> 35:25.862
BURNHAM:
How...

35:25.906 --> 35:27.429
How is he here?

35:27.473 --> 35:29.823
When I was trapped
in the network,

35:29.866 --> 35:34.741
I had moments of lucidity.

35:34.784 --> 35:36.482
I saw flashes...

35:38.266 --> 35:43.445
...as if I was moving between
this world and ours.

35:43.489 --> 35:46.318
That's when I found him.

35:49.277 --> 35:50.974
Hugh?

35:53.499 --> 35:54.761
Hugh?

35:54.804 --> 35:57.285
Hugh? No.

35:57.329 --> 35:59.069
No! No!

35:59.113 --> 36:00.854
No.

36:02.377 --> 36:05.206
: No.
Please don't go.

36:06.555 --> 36:08.470
Please.

36:12.213 --> 36:14.172
I brought him here.

36:15.434 --> 36:16.783
Thermodynamics.

36:16.826 --> 36:19.960
Energy cannot be
created or destroyed.

36:20.003 --> 36:21.657
It only changes states.

36:21.701 --> 36:23.659
Even in death.

36:23.703 --> 36:26.575
His energy
passed through me

36:26.619 --> 36:29.187
while I was the link
to the network.

36:29.230 --> 36:31.189
Like a lightning rod.

36:31.232 --> 36:32.581
When he took shape,

36:32.625 --> 36:34.366
it-it could only recognize him
as a foreign body,

36:34.409 --> 36:36.194
and it attacked him

36:36.237 --> 36:39.022
the way healthy cells
attack cancer.

36:40.372 --> 36:42.548
We have to go.

36:42.591 --> 36:44.463
Now.Uh-huh.

36:44.506 --> 36:45.986
All of us.

36:46.029 --> 36:48.597
I'm taking you home.

36:53.036 --> 36:56.257
The engines are overloading!
We have to disengage!

36:58.303 --> 36:59.434
I'm shutting down
primary regulators

36:59.478 --> 37:01.262
to buy us three minutes
and 30 seconds.

37:01.306 --> 37:03.395
You realize
you're not in charge?

37:03.438 --> 37:05.266
Even Section 31
has court-martials.

37:05.310 --> 37:07.442
Would they court-martial you
if they knew what you did

37:07.486 --> 37:10.880
six years ago on Deneva
to the wrong ambassador?

37:10.924 --> 37:15.276
A minor offense, even
if it were provable.

37:15.320 --> 37:17.191
If someone accessed the data
behind your firewall,

37:17.235 --> 37:18.366
it would be easy to prove.

37:18.410 --> 37:21.021
You may want
to consider that.

37:22.327 --> 37:25.286
Three minutes.

37:25.330 --> 37:27.201
Try not to blow us up.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.159
Such a worrier.

37:29.203 --> 37:30.465
LELAND:
We've bought you time.

37:32.467 --> 37:33.686
But not much.

37:33.729 --> 37:35.514
Copy that. Owo,
prepare to disengage

37:35.557 --> 37:37.516
tractor rigs. Mr. Saru,

37:37.559 --> 37:39.300
they need to
get a move on.

37:56.186 --> 37:57.927
Hugh,

37:57.971 --> 38:02.280
the cube is our airlock between
normal space and the network.

38:02.323 --> 38:04.369
It's safe to
cross here.

38:05.587 --> 38:06.371
See?

38:06.414 --> 38:08.634
I'm right here.

38:34.964 --> 38:36.662
I can't, Paul.

38:38.620 --> 38:40.405
I can't go with you.

38:47.803 --> 38:51.241
Why isn't it working?
Why can't he go through?

38:51.285 --> 38:53.156
His energy may have come
from your world,

38:53.200 --> 38:55.202
but everything else,
everything we used

38:55.245 --> 38:57.291
to build his body,
came from ours.

38:57.335 --> 38:58.771
TILLY: So what?
You brought me here.

38:58.814 --> 39:00.381
You can, you can use the cocoon
to transport him there.

39:00.425 --> 39:01.948
MAY:
I-I moved you.

39:01.991 --> 39:03.558
We did not create you.

39:03.602 --> 39:05.255
Our matter is
not your matter.

39:05.299 --> 39:07.301
You're saying you can't
rebuild him out there?

39:07.345 --> 39:10.435
I'm saying... I don't know.

39:11.566 --> 39:15.353
I couldn't maintain my own form
without inhabiting you.

39:16.789 --> 39:19.313
CULBER:
Paul.

39:28.017 --> 39:30.933
The JahSepp can
reclaim my matter.

39:37.723 --> 39:38.898
What are you doing?

39:38.941 --> 39:41.422
You have to let me go.

39:44.425 --> 39:47.297
PIKE:
Burnham, we are out of time!

39:47.341 --> 39:48.473
Understood.

39:48.516 --> 39:50.692
It's now or never.

39:52.477 --> 39:55.305
I can't be
the cause of this.

39:55.349 --> 39:57.307
I can't leave you twice.

39:57.351 --> 39:59.135
If you stay,

39:59.179 --> 40:01.529
it'll be twice as deadly
for the network.

40:02.704 --> 40:05.011
We'll find another way.

40:05.054 --> 40:09.189
You're devoted
to creation, to life.

40:12.497 --> 40:15.151
And there are a million reasons
to love you, but that's mine.

40:16.718 --> 40:19.417
Please don't ruin that for me.

40:29.427 --> 40:31.951
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

40:31.994 --> 40:33.387
May, you said
you couldn't rebuild yourself

40:33.431 --> 40:35.476
in our world because you
don't have human DNA.

40:36.564 --> 40:37.913
Right!

40:37.957 --> 40:40.699
Right. That was the
missing ingredient.

40:40.742 --> 40:42.440
The cocoon on our side is made

40:42.483 --> 40:44.093
entirely of atoms
from the human world.

40:44.137 --> 40:48.271
If you take Culber's DNA
and add it to the cocoon,

40:48.315 --> 40:50.448
then maybe he...Maybe not.

40:51.579 --> 40:53.538
Either way,
if we use the cocoon,

40:53.581 --> 40:55.453
our door closes.

40:58.412 --> 41:01.023
How many beings have lived
within each other?

41:02.677 --> 41:05.071
I feel I know you
as deeply as I know myself.

41:05.114 --> 41:07.508
I was gonna say that. I was just
worried it would sound weird.

41:07.552 --> 41:08.988
It's not something

41:09.031 --> 41:10.555
I ever thought
that I would have.

41:10.598 --> 41:14.515
We have connected across
evolution and across species.

41:14.559 --> 41:17.562
But when Commander
Stamets lost Hugh,

41:17.605 --> 41:18.606
he lost everything.

41:19.781 --> 41:21.522
And if we have a
chance to fix that,

41:21.566 --> 41:23.568
we have to try.

41:23.611 --> 41:25.874
I really believe
that the universe

41:25.918 --> 41:27.920
will bring us
back together somehow.

41:29.922 --> 41:31.706
You promise?

41:34.796 --> 41:36.450
Promise.

41:38.583 --> 41:40.454
SARU:
Commander.

41:40.498 --> 41:42.674
On our way.

41:42.717 --> 41:43.718
Now, May.

41:45.111 --> 41:47.026
I'll see you on
the other side.

41:52.379 --> 41:53.902
Burnham to the bridge.

41:53.946 --> 41:54.903
Black alert.

41:58.472 --> 42:00.866
Leland, now!

42:00.909 --> 42:02.215
They're activating
the spore drive!

42:02.258 --> 42:04.260
Out of the way!

43:16.724 --> 43:18.987
Commander Burnham?

43:22.425 --> 43:24.079
BURNHAM:
We made it.

43:27.387 --> 43:28.344
Stand down red alert.

43:28.388 --> 43:29.607
Mr. Saru,

43:29.650 --> 43:31.347
have Dr. Pollard meet
the team in Engineering.

43:35.613 --> 43:37.527
Mr. Tyler.

43:37.571 --> 43:39.355
You'll stay
on the bridge.

43:39.399 --> 43:41.401
Liaison protocol.

43:53.631 --> 43:55.415
TILLY:
Come on.

44:26.751 --> 44:29.014
Paul?

44:55.040 --> 44:58.086
Old friends
who don't shake hands?

44:58.130 --> 44:59.653
You're a long way
from home, Admiral.

44:59.697 --> 45:01.742
Indeed.

45:01.786 --> 45:03.613
Starfleet has new and
critical information

45:03.657 --> 45:05.267
about the seven signals.

45:05.311 --> 45:06.747
The first one
that appeared

45:06.791 --> 45:09.228
led Discovery
to an interstellar asteroid.

45:09.271 --> 45:12.753
But by the time you arrived,
the signal was gone.

45:12.797 --> 45:17.105
We detailed a research vessel
to scan for subspace readings,

45:17.149 --> 45:19.978
and the findings
were unexpected.

45:20.021 --> 45:21.762
For a brief window,

45:21.806 --> 45:24.112
the signal appears
to have left behind

45:24.156 --> 45:26.593
a trail of tachyon radiation.

45:26.636 --> 45:28.421
Tachyons?
Quantum field like that

45:28.464 --> 45:32.164
could imply...
time travel.

45:32.207 --> 45:34.166
Or it could be the by-product
of cloaking devices

45:34.209 --> 45:35.776
or transporters.

45:35.820 --> 45:38.997
You're both right.
Or maybe you're both wrong.

45:39.040 --> 45:41.651
Either way, the
only one with

45:41.695 --> 45:44.611
any sort of connection to these
signals is Lieutenant Spock,

45:44.654 --> 45:46.134
who's still a fugitive.

45:46.178 --> 45:49.572
I need both of you to
find him, and I need you

45:49.616 --> 45:51.661
to help each other.

45:51.705 --> 45:53.272
Come on, fellas.

45:53.315 --> 45:56.666
Cut the manlier-than-thou
bullshit.

45:56.710 --> 45:57.842
Leland,

45:57.885 --> 45:59.017
you camouflaged yourself

45:59.060 --> 46:01.019
from a Starfleet
captain, your friend,

46:01.062 --> 46:02.760
in the middle of
a rescue mission.

46:02.803 --> 46:05.458
Admiral, our camouf...Save it.

46:05.501 --> 46:09.027
And, Captain Pike,
Section 31 may not be

46:09.070 --> 46:12.682
the shining beacon of righteous
conduct you want it to be,

46:12.726 --> 46:15.294
but they are a critical
intelligence division,

46:15.337 --> 46:17.818
and we have more pressing
priorities than debating

46:17.862 --> 46:19.777
Article 14 of
Starfleet's charter.

46:19.820 --> 46:22.692
Nation building is never pretty.

46:22.736 --> 46:25.043
That is
the unappetizing truth,

46:25.086 --> 46:26.609
and you know it.

46:26.653 --> 46:28.916
Now, I don't care

46:28.960 --> 46:31.614
if you feel like
you are on opposite sides.

46:31.658 --> 46:33.878
We are all
on the same team.

46:33.921 --> 46:36.750
We go back a long way, Chris.

46:36.794 --> 46:41.146
But my job requires me
to walk a line, and...

46:41.189 --> 46:44.192
I crossed that
with you.

46:44.236 --> 46:46.368
I apologize.

46:46.412 --> 46:48.718
It's accepted.

46:48.762 --> 46:51.547
I'll try to remember
that my path is

46:51.591 --> 46:52.897
sometimes clearer than yours.

46:52.940 --> 46:54.899
Well...

46:54.942 --> 46:57.118
that's the understatement
of the millennium.

46:57.162 --> 46:58.903
Now tell me
what you know

46:58.946 --> 47:00.513
about the shuttle.

47:00.556 --> 47:01.731
Shuttle was a dead end.

47:01.775 --> 47:04.082
Mr. Spock knows
how to cover his trail.

47:04.125 --> 47:06.736
Burnham might know more about
where he'd be than she realizes.

47:06.780 --> 47:07.737
I'll talk to her.

47:07.781 --> 47:09.348
As we're working together,

47:09.391 --> 47:12.568
I assume my temporary
liaison officer is permanent.

47:12.612 --> 47:13.874
For the time being,

47:13.918 --> 47:15.658
Agent Tyler is yours.

47:15.702 --> 47:17.008
Unless you would prefer
Captain Georgiou.

47:17.051 --> 47:19.053
No, thank you.No.

47:29.150 --> 47:32.545
COMPUTER: Incoming message
from Captain Philippa Georgiou.

47:36.810 --> 47:38.246
Put it through
to the science lab.

47:48.082 --> 47:49.910
I heard you bought us
a few minutes.

47:49.954 --> 47:53.871
Is that any way to thank
the savior of the Discovery?

47:53.914 --> 47:57.483
I know you want to be paid back,
in spades.

47:57.526 --> 47:59.441
Maybe I'm an altruist.

47:59.485 --> 48:00.878
Maybe I'm a Terran.

48:00.921 --> 48:02.880
In fact, you were.

48:02.923 --> 48:06.231
Much more fun
than this Vulcan stoicism.

48:06.274 --> 48:08.755
I really need to know
your intentions.

48:10.539 --> 48:12.802
Toward Spock.

48:12.846 --> 48:18.243
I want to find him
before a vigilante mob does,

48:18.286 --> 48:20.201
or a posse of
trigger-happy

48:20.245 --> 48:22.464
Starfleet cowboys.

48:22.508 --> 48:25.424
I'm pretty sure
you want the same thing.

48:25.467 --> 48:28.166
There's just no world

48:28.209 --> 48:30.951
where I could give that
serious consideration.

48:30.995 --> 48:36.783
I've had your life
in my hands a dozen times.

48:38.306 --> 48:41.440
You're gonna have to start
trusting me eventually.

48:41.483 --> 48:44.965
Said the scorpion to the frog.

48:45.009 --> 48:49.056
Have a little faith, Michael.

48:52.886 --> 48:54.844
BURNHAM:
I envy those who can believe

48:54.888 --> 48:58.848
there is a greater hand
writing our story,

48:58.892 --> 49:03.288
who chooses the words
to keep chaos at bay.

49:05.943 --> 49:07.901
Connection.

49:10.904 --> 49:12.906
Joy.

49:16.997 --> 49:18.956
Love.

49:21.132 --> 49:23.351
And resurrection.

49:26.006 --> 49:30.880
With these words, the path
becomes clear for a moment,

49:30.924 --> 49:33.927
and then disappears.

50:13.401 --> 50:15.099
If I have a path...

50:17.101 --> 50:19.886
...I'm still searching for it.

50:21.801 --> 50:24.021
We all are.

50:27.111 --> 50:30.853
That's how we find our way,

50:30.897 --> 50:34.553
by choosing to walk forward,

50:34.596 --> 50:36.685
together.

50:39.297 --> 50:41.212
And if there is a greater hand

50:41.255 --> 50:44.519
leading us
into an uncertain future...

50:48.219 --> 50:51.222
...I can only hope
it guides us well.
