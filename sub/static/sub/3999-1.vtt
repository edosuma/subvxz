WEBVTT

00:08.008 --> 00:09.842
I can't. I can't do it.

00:09.844 --> 00:12.378
Oh, of course you can
and you will.

00:12.380 --> 00:16.015
Okay, Schmidt, we've been
to 11 weddings in a row.

00:16.017 --> 00:17.850
That's too many weddings.

00:17.852 --> 00:20.185
I can't even get
into the fridge anymore.

00:25.058 --> 00:26.825
Aah!

00:26.827 --> 00:28.060
I'm so hungry.

00:28.062 --> 00:29.995
Why does everybody get
to have a party

00:29.997 --> 00:31.663
for everything in their life?

00:31.665 --> 00:33.065
Why can't I have a party

00:33.067 --> 00:35.200
for really dedicating myself
to knitting this summer?

00:35.202 --> 00:37.136
God, I hate that you knit.
I hate everything about it.

00:37.138 --> 00:39.805
Why?
- It makes me angry and scared
all at the same time.

00:39.807 --> 00:41.206
Just like
when I hear the phrase,

00:41.208 --> 00:43.409
"Academy Award Winner
Anna Paquin."

00:43.411 --> 00:45.511
Jessica, you are going
to this wedding.
Well... well...

00:45.513 --> 00:47.579
And I'm gonna tell you why:
sexual intercourse.

00:47.581 --> 00:48.847
Do you remember that?

00:48.849 --> 00:50.649
You got to get
back out there, Jess.

00:50.651 --> 00:52.418
The last mouth
that you kissed

00:52.420 --> 00:53.419
was Nick's mouth.

00:53.421 --> 00:54.820
That was four months ago.

00:54.822 --> 00:57.056
Think about that.
That's horrible.

00:57.058 --> 00:58.857
Hey. Is Schmidt making fun
of me?

00:58.859 --> 00:59.925
Yes.
- Hi, Nick.

00:59.927 --> 01:00.926
Okay, cool. Just checking.

01:00.928 --> 01:02.327
Are you wearing
tap shoes?

01:02.329 --> 01:03.228
I got 'em at the Goodwill.
I thought they were

01:03.230 --> 01:04.196
just really shiny dress shoes.

01:04.198 --> 01:05.264
(clicking)

01:05.266 --> 01:06.832
They're cool.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.100
COACH:
Hey, what do you guys think

01:08.102 --> 01:10.069
about this belt?
Like for a wedding gift?

01:10.071 --> 01:11.537
Nick, Coach,
get in here.

01:11.539 --> 01:12.971
Everybody in here.

01:13.540 --> 01:14.873
Are we a man down?

01:14.875 --> 01:16.241
I feel like
there's one more of us.

01:16.243 --> 01:17.910
Something going on
in Jess's room?!

01:17.912 --> 01:19.178
I'm coming!

01:19.180 --> 01:21.113
(moans)

01:21.115 --> 01:23.248
Just wait for me.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.284
He's sore from
Police Academy.
I'm sore from Police Academy!

01:25.286 --> 01:28.921
Okay, we have gone to wedding
after wedding this summer,

01:28.923 --> 01:31.090
and, with the exception
of Coach and myself,

01:31.092 --> 01:33.225
none of us
have truly taken advantage

01:33.227 --> 01:36.962
of the sexual opportunities
that a wedding provides.
JESS: Not true.

01:36.964 --> 01:39.932
Wedding number seven,
an unneutered dog ran after me,

01:39.934 --> 01:41.066
so...
- (scoffs)

01:41.068 --> 01:42.968
JESS:
You did?
Yes.

01:42.970 --> 01:44.236
She was wearing
a hospital bracelet

01:44.238 --> 01:45.737
and carrying a dead goldfish
in a bag.

01:45.739 --> 01:47.439
(snorts)
- She was still
a bridesmaid.

01:47.441 --> 01:48.640
COACH:
She looked like the
snowman from<i> Frozen.</i>

01:48.642 --> 01:50.109
Hey, aim for
the middle.

01:50.111 --> 01:52.544
The ride's rough at first,
but the body adjusts.

01:52.546 --> 01:53.378
(thud, clattering)

01:53.380 --> 01:54.546
I'm all right!

01:54.548 --> 01:55.447
I just rolled
off the couch.

01:55.449 --> 01:56.982
Winston, please!

01:56.984 --> 01:59.751
I can't close my ass!

01:59.753 --> 02:02.154
We are hooking up tonight,
all five of us,

02:02.156 --> 02:04.256
including the gimp.

02:04.258 --> 02:05.591
This is the last wedding
of summer,

02:05.593 --> 02:07.292
which means
it is our last chance.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.761
Nobody meets anybody in fall...
No.

02:09.763 --> 02:11.130
or winter.
What, are you gonna gamble

02:11.132 --> 02:13.999
on the unknown contents
of a bulky sweater?

02:15.301 --> 02:16.335
Not me.

02:16.337 --> 02:17.603
Do you realize
how important this is?

02:17.605 --> 02:18.604
I do.

02:18.606 --> 02:22.040
Winter... is coming.

02:23.343 --> 02:25.577
No one comes home alone.

02:25.579 --> 02:27.146
You know what, yeah.

02:27.148 --> 02:29.114
Yeah, I'm in.

02:29.116 --> 02:30.282
She's in.
We're all in.

02:30.284 --> 02:31.183
Yeah.
- Yes.

02:31.185 --> 02:32.284
I'm in.

02:32.286 --> 02:33.152
I can't hear what's going on,

02:33.154 --> 02:34.419
but I'm in.

02:34.421 --> 02:36.822
All five of us out there
together,

02:36.824 --> 02:38.157
in the wild,

02:38.159 --> 02:40.626
getting some strange,
like a sex fist.

02:40.628 --> 02:42.161
I'm sorry, what?
- Mm, that's not
what you mean.

02:42.163 --> 02:42.995
What's a sex fist, now?

02:42.997 --> 02:44.329
One, two, three, four,

02:44.331 --> 02:47.166
five of us, together,
make a fist.

02:47.168 --> 02:48.433
You're making a
mistake right now.
- Schmidt, Nick,

02:48.435 --> 02:50.769
Coach, Winston, Jess-- sex fist.

02:50.771 --> 02:52.771
When you put them all together,
NICK:
No, that's not right.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.306
tearing our way
through the reception.

02:54.308 --> 02:56.642
Slow down.
- Are you listening
to what you're saying?

02:56.644 --> 02:58.177
(Coach and Nick muttering)
Isn't that sweet? It's
a metaphor for togetherness.

02:58.179 --> 02:59.811
It could just be a fist.
All five of us

02:59.813 --> 03:01.813
sex-fisting our way...

03:01.815 --> 03:03.982
¶ Who's that girl? ¶

03:03.984 --> 03:06.418
¶<i> Who's that girl?</i> ¶
¶ It's Jess. ¶

03:11.224 --> 03:13.158
Hi, everybody. Uh, I'm Ted.
I'm, uh...

03:13.160 --> 03:15.194
I'm Mark's best friend
and his best man.

03:15.196 --> 03:18.397
I-I've known Mark since he was
in diapers, you know?

03:18.399 --> 03:21.733
Uh, and, by that,
I mean junior year of college.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.669
(laughter)

03:23.671 --> 03:26.471
Ah, what about him, Jess?

03:26.473 --> 03:28.173
What? The best man?

03:28.175 --> 03:29.007
Best man.

03:29.009 --> 03:30.375
Get real, you clown.

03:30.377 --> 03:32.044
I've been out
of the game too long.

03:32.046 --> 03:33.378
He's a wedding celebrity.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.813
Everybody say
hi to Nana.

03:34.815 --> 03:35.747
How great does Nana look,
everybody?

03:35.749 --> 03:38.083
Give it up for Nana.

03:38.085 --> 03:39.418
Six months sober.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.252
(laughter)

03:40.254 --> 03:42.321
I'm kidding. Three months.

03:42.323 --> 03:44.256
(laughter)

03:44.258 --> 03:45.557
Jess, come on.
Get in there.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.025
What?
- You got this.

03:47.027 --> 03:48.393
Think so?
- Yes, you got the bangs parted.

03:48.395 --> 03:49.194
You're looking good.

03:49.196 --> 03:50.229
Really?
- Yes.

03:50.231 --> 03:52.831
Okay.
Wait a minute. Hold on.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.100
Stick your boobs out.
Gotta turn the headlights on.

03:55.102 --> 03:56.768
Ew! Schmidt.

03:56.770 --> 03:57.569
But you got it.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.004
Sex fist.

03:59.006 --> 04:00.272
All right.

04:00.274 --> 04:01.640
Hi.

04:02.709 --> 04:04.209
Hi to you.

04:04.211 --> 04:05.344
(chuckles)

04:05.346 --> 04:06.278
I'm Coach.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.513
Oh, my God.

04:09.282 --> 04:10.349
You don't remember me?

04:10.351 --> 04:11.850
Yeah...

04:11.852 --> 04:13.085
Yeah, I remember...
(yells)

04:13.087 --> 04:14.920
Ooh...
- Ooh...

04:14.922 --> 04:17.222
I'm good.
- COACH:
It's the end of
the wedding season.

04:17.224 --> 04:18.457
We've got some repeats.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.592
Oh, God. What is she doing here?

04:20.594 --> 04:22.461
I thought she was
in Australia.

04:22.463 --> 04:23.462
How do I look?

04:23.464 --> 04:24.696
How-how Jewish?

04:24.698 --> 04:26.131
I mean, like, good
Jewish or bad Jewish?

04:26.133 --> 04:27.432
Oh, I won't say--
it feels like a trap.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.735
Come on.
Come with me.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.470
I haven't
told the guys

04:31.472 --> 04:33.805
that you broke up with
Buster yet, 'cause, um...

04:33.807 --> 04:35.307
I feel like I might
have to tell Schmidt

04:35.309 --> 04:37.242
outside a hospital,

04:37.244 --> 04:38.810
like, you know,
when you give a baby

04:38.812 --> 04:40.312
peanut butter
for the first time?

04:40.314 --> 04:41.713
Yeah.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.482
You're not doing
this tonight.

04:43.484 --> 04:45.317
What?
- You're not doing
this tonight.

04:45.319 --> 04:46.418
I'm not listening
to you.
- You're not doing
this tonight.

04:46.420 --> 04:47.452
I'm picturing
Cece naked.

04:47.454 --> 04:48.453
Stop doing this!

04:48.455 --> 04:50.155
Cece has a boyfriend,

04:50.157 --> 04:51.423
and your obsession with her

04:51.425 --> 04:53.292
is not good for you, man.

04:53.294 --> 04:54.960
She's been away
all summer,

04:54.962 --> 04:56.962
and you have been killing it!

04:56.964 --> 04:58.497
Mostly hand stuff.

04:58.499 --> 04:59.831
Who had sex with a bridesmaid

04:59.833 --> 05:02.134
on a 45-minute flight
to San Jose?

05:02.136 --> 05:03.302
Me.

05:03.304 --> 05:04.736
You were boarding group "D."

05:04.738 --> 05:06.638
She was "B."
How's that even possible?

05:06.640 --> 05:08.340
Gotta think outside
of the box, my man.
Now get your little

05:08.342 --> 05:10.475
white butt back out there

05:10.477 --> 05:13.278
and finish the summer
of sex that you started.

05:13.280 --> 05:14.346
That's what I'm
talking about.

05:14.348 --> 05:15.347
Cece gone.

05:15.349 --> 05:16.748
See that bridesmaid
right there?

05:16.750 --> 05:17.516
The pretty one?
- SCHMIDT:
Sure do.

05:17.518 --> 05:19.151
The foxy lady?
- Mm-hmm.

05:19.153 --> 05:20.319
Well, you're going home
with her tonight.

05:20.321 --> 05:21.486
And I got
your back.
- Look at that.

05:21.488 --> 05:22.354
She looks like the girl
from the commercial

05:22.356 --> 05:24.089
playing tennis
with a tampon in.

05:24.091 --> 05:25.257
Let's do it.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.193
Hi. I'm Jess.

05:28.195 --> 05:28.960
Hi. I'm Ted.

05:28.962 --> 05:31.330
Cheers.
- Cheers.

05:31.332 --> 05:32.364
So you're from Wisconsin...
(voice squeaks)

05:32.366 --> 05:33.598
(clears throat)

05:34.300 --> 05:35.367
(coughs)

05:35.369 --> 05:36.802
I'm sorry.
Is this thing on?

05:36.804 --> 05:38.503
You're making your throat
like a microphone.

05:38.505 --> 05:39.538
Yeah.
(goofy, raspy cough)

05:39.540 --> 05:40.339
That's funny!

05:40.341 --> 05:41.673
Thank you.
- Yeah.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.608
WOMAN:
I loved your speech.
Oh.

05:43.610 --> 05:45.544
Hi. I'm Kat.
- Hi.

05:45.546 --> 05:47.379
I'm Ted.
KAT:
Really nice to meet you.

05:47.381 --> 05:49.214
Yeah. Oh.

05:49.216 --> 05:50.349
Excuse me.

05:50.351 --> 05:52.351
My girlfriend's
getting jealous.

05:52.353 --> 05:55.220
KAT:
Perfect specimen.

05:58.958 --> 06:01.360
Ted is the only
eligible guy here,

06:01.362 --> 06:03.562
and we are his two best
options for procreation.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.397
Oh.
- I'm not
trying

06:05.399 --> 06:06.832
to intimidate you,

06:06.834 --> 06:08.400
I just want you to know
who you're dealing with

06:08.402 --> 06:09.968
if we're both gonna compete
for this man tonight.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.903
What?
- Here are
the facts:

06:11.905 --> 06:13.572
I am technically
a genius,

06:13.574 --> 06:14.906
I have a
photographic memory

06:14.908 --> 06:16.375
and I lost my virginity
to Malcolm Gladwell.

06:16.377 --> 06:17.976
Okay...

06:17.978 --> 06:20.345
Have you ever heard
of Plutoxic Syndrome?

06:20.347 --> 06:21.713
That's because
I cured it.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.215
You're welcome,
vaginas everywhere.

06:23.217 --> 06:25.884
(goofy voice):
Oh, thank you very much.

06:26.586 --> 06:29.054
I'm sorry, that was...

06:29.056 --> 06:30.822
vagina voice, and a...

06:30.824 --> 06:32.157
it was a huge mistake.

06:32.159 --> 06:33.592
I stay current on
sporting events.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.527
I watch 30 minutes
of porn every night

06:35.529 --> 06:37.562
just to stay up to date
on the latest sex trends.

06:37.564 --> 06:38.930
In the coming months,
I'm predicting

06:38.932 --> 06:40.499
a throwback
to missionary.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.501
It all depends on
what happens in Syria.

06:42.503 --> 06:43.835
Well, have you ever had sex

06:43.837 --> 06:45.404
when you were really,
really, really, really,

06:45.406 --> 06:47.572
really, really tired?
I'm never tired.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.408
I'm the better
choice of mate.

06:49.410 --> 06:51.510
From a purely
biological standpoint,

06:51.512 --> 06:52.611
you're shorter,
weaker, and dumber.

06:52.613 --> 06:54.646
No offense.
I love those shoes.

06:56.048 --> 06:58.750
I love your shoes.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.852
But I love<i> your</i> shoes.

07:00.854 --> 07:02.387
<i>Your</i> shoes.

07:02.389 --> 07:03.789
No, I love
your shoes.
- Your shoes.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.390
Your shoes.
- (very quiet):
Your shoes.

07:05.392 --> 07:07.192
(whispering):
Your shoes.

07:07.194 --> 07:08.960
(no voice)

07:08.962 --> 07:11.930
What?
I was just moving my mouth.

07:15.968 --> 07:17.869
So you're
competing with her?
- JESS:
I can take her down,

07:17.871 --> 07:19.971
because I have something
she doesn't have:

07:19.973 --> 07:21.106
you guys.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.774
Now, strategies.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.109
What about you, Coach?

07:24.111 --> 07:25.310
You hook up at weddings
all the time.

07:25.312 --> 07:26.478
What's your strategy?

07:26.480 --> 07:27.913
It's called being
a gorgeous black man

07:27.915 --> 07:29.481
with the body of
an action figure.

07:29.483 --> 07:31.416
I could give that a try.

07:31.418 --> 07:33.452
(laughing)
NICK: You want to know
what your ex-boyfriend

07:33.454 --> 07:34.486
thinks you should do
to get the guy?

07:34.488 --> 07:36.121
No, I don't.
That's super weird.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.889
Yeah, it's too weird, so...
somebody else.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.624
Okay, look, babe, just get out
on the dance floor, okay?

07:39.626 --> 07:42.227
Guys think that they way you
dance is the way you have sex.

07:42.229 --> 07:44.296
Okay.
So just give them
a little something, okay?

07:44.298 --> 07:46.131
You just need to, like,
roll your body a little bit.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.300
Something a little sexy.

07:48.302 --> 07:49.734
Pop your hip out
a little bit.

07:49.736 --> 07:51.236
Hey, man, I'm not gonna
lie to you right now.

07:51.238 --> 07:52.471
I've got a halfie.
Okay, we got to go!

07:52.473 --> 07:54.673
Excuse me, everybody!
I need a minute.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.908
What do you think of this?

08:00.112 --> 08:01.379
Mm... hmm...

08:03.115 --> 08:03.949
Mm-mm.

08:03.951 --> 08:05.517
I'm good to go now.

08:05.519 --> 08:07.452
Let's go!
All right.

08:07.454 --> 08:09.087
Ugh!

08:09.089 --> 08:10.655
I just want
to get back out there,

08:10.657 --> 08:12.958
but I feel like I forgot
everything I knew.

08:12.960 --> 08:16.461
Do you guys still like an
Oakland face with an L.A. booty?

08:16.463 --> 08:18.330
Would you like to know
my strategy, Jess?

08:18.332 --> 08:20.532
Is the art of seduction
really where you shine?

08:20.534 --> 08:22.334
Be there.

08:22.336 --> 08:23.468
(laughs):
That's it?

08:23.470 --> 08:25.871
Yeah. Just be there.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.939
No matter where he goes,
be there.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.341
He gets a drink, be there.

08:29.343 --> 08:30.842
He talks to his
friends, be there.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.844
At the end of the
night, be there.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.679
It's called
"The Joe Biden."

08:34.681 --> 08:36.047
That's creepy, man.

08:36.049 --> 08:37.148
The basic concept
of what he's saying, though,

08:37.150 --> 08:38.149
could actually work.

08:38.151 --> 08:39.317
Yeah.

08:39.319 --> 08:40.685
(quiet laugh)

08:40.687 --> 08:42.721
I'm gonna Biden his ass.

08:42.723 --> 08:44.489
Mm-hmm.

08:44.491 --> 08:47.192
Oh, yeah. Yup.
That'll do it.

08:47.194 --> 08:48.793
I know.

08:48.795 --> 08:50.695
Oh, hey! Uh, you know,

08:50.697 --> 08:53.632
Kat was just telling me
about her hairlessness.

08:53.634 --> 08:55.066
Hmm.
She's like a seal.

08:55.068 --> 08:57.168
(laughs)
- Hmm. That's okay.

08:57.170 --> 08:59.170
You guys talk.

08:59.172 --> 09:02.173
I'm just gonna be here.

09:02.175 --> 09:03.542
I'm sorry I didn't call you.

09:03.544 --> 09:05.744
Why are you so
scared of intimacy?

09:05.746 --> 09:08.213
Who broke your heart and why
haven't you forgiven her?

09:08.215 --> 09:10.715
Uh... well...
Yeah, the thi...

09:10.717 --> 09:11.750
Huh?

09:11.752 --> 09:13.652
You're arrogant,
you're sexist...

09:13.654 --> 09:15.086
You stole my phone charger.

09:15.088 --> 09:16.988
You're conceited.
You're a liar.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.189
Aah!

09:18.191 --> 09:19.224
I rented<i> Best Man Holiday.</i>

09:19.226 --> 09:21.259
You're not in it.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.530
So, you know Tom...

09:25.532 --> 09:29.534
uh, Tom, of course, he wanted
to sell shoes for a profit.

09:29.536 --> 09:31.036
And I said, "No."

09:31.038 --> 09:32.237
I said, "You...

09:32.239 --> 09:35.273
you do something better."

09:36.175 --> 09:39.110
You got a... pretty good face.

09:39.112 --> 09:41.646
So, you guys want to come
home with us, right?

09:42.782 --> 09:43.949
We want to do a four-way.

09:43.951 --> 09:46.117
Me, her, you and him.

09:47.053 --> 09:49.187
Of course. We'll, uh... Nick?

09:49.189 --> 09:50.255
(knocks)

09:50.257 --> 09:51.856
Nick?!

09:54.694 --> 09:56.394
Hi. How are you?
Hi. Good. How are you?

09:56.396 --> 09:59.598
Are you enjoying the wedding?
Yeah.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.766
You be... Yeah.

10:01.768 --> 10:05.437
¶ ¶
Mm...! Mmm...

10:05.439 --> 10:06.705
Mm!

10:07.740 --> 10:08.740
Hey.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.709
Hey, Nick.
Hey, Schmidt.

10:10.711 --> 10:13.578
Hey, do you know how they sell
ice cream at the drugstore...?

10:13.580 --> 10:15.614
I'm not having a four-way
with you-- end of discussion.

10:15.616 --> 10:17.215
Come on, Nick. We don't have
any other choice.

10:17.217 --> 10:19.217
I've found 15 other girls
since I've been here.

10:19.219 --> 10:21.953
They're all either married
or taken or mad at Coach.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.588
I'm not doing
a four-way with you...

10:23.590 --> 10:24.623
It's the last helicopter
out of Saigon, my man.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.291
Charlie won.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.892
No, Schmidt.
You won't even know
it's me, Nick.

10:27.894 --> 10:30.629
Look, at this point,
it's all skin and shapes...

10:30.631 --> 10:31.763
That's-that's
what I'm afraid of.

10:31.765 --> 10:32.831
It-it's the fog of war, man.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.666
There's so much stuff going on.

10:34.668 --> 10:36.067
You're just, you're just,
you're just here.
- Yeah...

10:36.069 --> 10:37.235
You don't even know
what's happening.

10:37.237 --> 10:38.603
Okay, but I want to know
what's happening

10:38.605 --> 10:40.005
if it's with sex--
I don't want some

10:40.007 --> 10:42.007
fog of war on top of me,
if it looks like you.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.608
That's the point.

10:43.610 --> 10:44.976
The fog of war is something
you can't see through.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.611
Like, the whole thing
with the Charlie thing

10:46.613 --> 10:47.979
and Vietnam,
I don't know who I'm fighting!

10:47.981 --> 10:50.448
I'm soft like a lady.
You won't even know.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.684
But what if I get a surprise?
"A surprise"?

10:52.686 --> 10:55.120
What if there's a surprise
on me?
- There's not gonna be
a surprise on you.

10:55.122 --> 10:57.022
What if I'm fighting the war
and boom-- there's a surprise!

10:57.024 --> 10:58.456
You go north, I go south.

10:58.458 --> 11:01.092
Do you know what I'm saying?

11:01.094 --> 11:02.694
I'll be in steerage
and I'm rowing.

11:02.696 --> 11:04.663
And I'm rowing
and I'm rowing and the....

11:04.665 --> 11:06.131
You're up in the crow's nest.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.532
Fre-fresh air up there, man.

11:07.534 --> 11:09.134
And I'm in the trenches,
you know?

11:09.136 --> 11:10.335
I'm digging for coal.

11:10.337 --> 11:11.670
I'm breathing in those fumes.

11:11.672 --> 11:13.138
And you're up here.
You're just taking

11:13.140 --> 11:15.306
in the sights.
You're spotting dolphins, huh?

11:15.308 --> 11:17.876
You're just the handsome prince
covered in salty sea spray...
I don't want

11:17.878 --> 11:20.779
you calling me handsome
before a potential four-way!

11:20.781 --> 11:21.846
This...

11:21.848 --> 11:23.214
Nick, please!

11:23.216 --> 11:24.149
I'm begging you for this.

11:24.151 --> 11:25.350
Cece is here.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.785
And I can't get her
out of my head.

11:26.787 --> 11:27.819
Don't, don't, don't
play the Cece card

11:27.821 --> 11:29.154
right now, don't do...

11:29.156 --> 11:30.822
I'm gonna play
the Cece card, okay?

11:30.824 --> 11:33.324
Look, she's here and I don't
want to go home alone.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.560
(groans)
- I need your help, please.

11:35.562 --> 11:38.730
(grunts loudly)

11:38.732 --> 11:40.532
What's up, guys?

11:40.534 --> 11:41.866
Tell you what.
I am so sore

11:41.868 --> 11:43.835
I can't have sex
with nobody tonight.

11:43.837 --> 11:47.305
Only thing I want in my mouth
is Mr. and Mrs. I.B. Profen.

11:47.307 --> 11:48.740
(laughs)
Minus the mister.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.709
My man-- Winston,
I got a question for you.

11:50.711 --> 11:52.911
Do you think that,
that two men

11:52.913 --> 11:55.680
can engage in group sex
without...

11:55.682 --> 11:57.816
without compromising
their friendship.

11:57.818 --> 11:58.917
Good question, good question.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.518
Um... okay.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.754
Uh, let's just say

12:02.756 --> 12:03.755
Nick is the salt.

12:03.757 --> 12:05.590
And, Schmidt,
you are the pepper.

12:05.592 --> 12:07.358
I'm assuming we're
talking about you two.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.893
Hypothetically, I suppose.
whatever.
- Yes.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.595
Hypothetically,
all right.
Not necessarily.

12:10.597 --> 12:12.630
Actually I'm gonna need some...

12:13.532 --> 12:14.566
Ooh, boy.

12:14.568 --> 12:16.000
Seems as if
I've made a mess.

12:16.002 --> 12:17.535
Got to clean that up.

12:17.537 --> 12:19.070
Yes, look at that.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.772
Salt all in the pepper.

12:20.774 --> 12:22.006
Pepper all in the salt.

12:22.008 --> 12:24.075
Just mixed up like that.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.411
Is there salt shoved
in the pepper hole?

12:26.413 --> 12:27.746
How'd it get in there?

12:27.748 --> 12:30.181
How did salt
get shoved into this

12:30.183 --> 12:32.884
tiny, tiny pepper hole?

12:32.886 --> 12:35.754
Nick?

12:35.756 --> 12:38.823
You're terrible
at demonstrations!

12:43.028 --> 12:44.562
Oh, uh...

12:44.564 --> 12:45.797
You know,
I-I'm just gonna, uh...

12:45.799 --> 12:46.898
Yeah, Ted. Get crazy.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.566
Leave it all out there
on the field.

12:48.568 --> 12:49.934
Okay.
(claps hands)

12:49.936 --> 12:52.237
I'll come back with stories.
(chuckles)

12:52.239 --> 12:53.772
(both laugh)

12:53.774 --> 12:55.206
Are you Bidening?

12:55.208 --> 12:56.741
What? No.

12:56.743 --> 12:58.810
(whispers):
How did you know about that?

12:58.812 --> 13:02.213
Because I'm always gonna
be one step ahead of you.

13:02.215 --> 13:03.481
Extreme Biden!

13:10.156 --> 13:11.389
(whispering):
Kat.

13:11.391 --> 13:12.423
(grunts with effort)

13:12.425 --> 13:14.459
Kat, Kat... let me out.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.261
This was a huge mistake.

13:16.263 --> 13:17.829
I'm sorry.
I'm not proud of this.

13:17.831 --> 13:19.697
It smells so bad in here.

13:21.600 --> 13:22.901
(quiet groan)

13:24.136 --> 13:25.136
TED:
Jess?

13:25.138 --> 13:26.237
Hi.

13:26.239 --> 13:28.907
Jess, th-this is the men's room.

13:32.945 --> 13:35.313
This is where it all happens.

13:38.350 --> 13:41.920
Don't wait for me, Ted,
'cause I might be awhile.

13:44.023 --> 13:46.157
See you out
on the dance floor.

13:51.697 --> 13:53.198
And at wedding 12,

13:53.200 --> 13:56.234
I sat on a men's toilet.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.209
When did one-on-one sex
become old-fashioned?

14:04.211 --> 14:05.610
You know, America's got to take

14:05.612 --> 14:07.445
a hard look in the mirror
at ourself.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.948
We used to make things.

14:10.850 --> 14:11.883
Just be glad you're not single.

14:11.885 --> 14:13.184
Oh.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.019
Actually Buster and I broke up.

14:15.021 --> 14:16.688
So, anyway...

14:16.690 --> 14:19.524
(groaning):
Oh... no!

14:19.526 --> 14:22.227
No!

14:22.229 --> 14:24.395
That is so terrible!

14:24.397 --> 14:26.397
Didn't know you cared this much.
No, no, no, no...

14:26.399 --> 14:27.732
If you're single...
- Mm-hmm.

14:27.734 --> 14:30.068
that means that I have
to do something.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.970
Something awful.

14:31.972 --> 14:34.038
You have no idea
what you just did to me.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.974
You have no idea, young lady!

14:40.045 --> 14:41.145
I'll do the four-way with you.

14:41.147 --> 14:42.881
Yes! Okay, I'm gonna
go book the room.

14:42.883 --> 14:44.883
You go to housekeeping,
have them give you

14:44.885 --> 14:46.651
as many shower caps
as they'll give you...
- Okay, stop.

14:46.653 --> 14:48.319
They're gonna get one hand
and I'm not gonna move it.

14:48.321 --> 14:49.754
I'm just gonna
dangle it into the mix

14:49.756 --> 14:51.055
while I look
at something else on my phone.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.257
And that's the deal.

14:52.259 --> 14:53.491
Aw, man, this is
gonna be big for us.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.059
This is for you, buddy.
- Thanks.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.427
(laughs):
Yeah!

14:57.930 --> 14:59.030
What the hell is that?

14:59.032 --> 15:00.431
What are you talking about?

15:00.433 --> 15:01.866
Yeah, what's-what's that
on your hand, man?

15:01.868 --> 15:03.534
Why is it so rough?
It's like hoof.

15:03.536 --> 15:05.003
There's nothing on my hand.
This is a regular old hand...

15:05.005 --> 15:06.271
I'm out, I'm out.
You're out of what?

15:06.273 --> 15:07.772
Four-way.
Done. No way.

15:07.774 --> 15:09.540
Not with
that thing.
- You're a buffoon.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.075
That is ridiculous.
I was only doing
it for you, Schmidt,

15:11.077 --> 15:12.944
so you don't freak out when
you find out that Cece's single.

15:12.946 --> 15:15.580
And now I'm the weirdo
with the hoof hand.

15:15.582 --> 15:16.948
What... take it back
from the hoof hand.

15:16.950 --> 15:18.516
What'd you say before?
About Cece being single?

15:18.518 --> 15:19.684
How do you know that?

15:19.686 --> 15:21.452
She's single?

15:21.454 --> 15:23.521
I have my, uh...

15:23.523 --> 15:25.456
assumptions.
- So Cece's
single now.

15:25.458 --> 15:26.457
You don't know
that for sure.

15:26.459 --> 15:27.525
That's interesting.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.027
Why are you so calm?

15:31.263 --> 15:32.263
Interesting.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.332
Don't just say
"interesting."

15:35.601 --> 15:37.135
That's interesting.

15:37.137 --> 15:38.703
If you're gonna say
"interesting" say<i> why</i>

15:38.705 --> 15:40.004
it's interesting.
It is interesting.

15:41.807 --> 15:43.107
(screams)

15:43.109 --> 15:44.275
Aah!

15:44.277 --> 15:45.944
Nick!

15:45.946 --> 15:47.145
What are you doing here?

15:47.147 --> 15:47.979
What are<i> you</i> doing here?

15:47.981 --> 15:49.113
It's the men's room!

15:49.115 --> 15:50.381
Mmm...

15:50.383 --> 15:52.684
Jess, scooch over.
- All right.

15:54.286 --> 15:56.955
(groans)

15:56.957 --> 15:59.424
What are you doing?
Just hiding in the bathroom?

15:59.426 --> 16:00.491
Kind of.

16:00.493 --> 16:01.726
(laughs)

16:01.728 --> 16:04.095
(laughs)
- Me, too.

16:04.097 --> 16:05.930
I know I'm supposed to, like,

16:05.932 --> 16:07.231
"get back out there,"

16:07.233 --> 16:09.300
you know?
But...

16:09.302 --> 16:11.602
maybe I'm just not built for it.

16:11.604 --> 16:12.837
Man, I hear you.

16:12.839 --> 16:14.072
Sidebar: What do
my hands feel like?

16:14.074 --> 16:16.174
Hooves.
- Aw, son of a...

16:18.310 --> 16:19.610
Maybe there's a reason

16:19.612 --> 16:21.079
I'm not up on a fridge,
you know?

16:21.081 --> 16:22.747
Maybe some people
are fridge people,

16:22.749 --> 16:24.115
and other people are...

16:24.117 --> 16:25.750
toilet people.

16:25.752 --> 16:28.186
You think you're
a toilet person?

16:28.188 --> 16:30.154
(laughing)
- You're not
a toilet person.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.456
You want to get on the fridge,

16:31.458 --> 16:32.623
you'll get on the fridge, Jess.

16:32.625 --> 16:33.992
Just be yourself,

16:33.994 --> 16:36.094
and if he's not
into Jessica Day,

16:36.096 --> 16:38.162
then there's something
wrong with him.

16:41.767 --> 16:43.368
Be myself.

16:43.370 --> 16:45.136
Like do my Tina Turner
impression?

16:45.138 --> 16:46.371
How did your brain jump there?

16:46.373 --> 16:48.373
¶ What's love got to do ¶

16:48.375 --> 16:50.008
¶ Got to do with it? ¶

16:50.010 --> 16:51.209
(laughs)

16:51.211 --> 16:52.010
(laughs)
- All right.

16:52.012 --> 16:53.277
I hear your logic.

16:53.279 --> 16:56.114
Come on.
- No man
wants that,

16:56.116 --> 16:59.417
but...
you can't quit, either.

17:00.552 --> 17:01.986
You're our last hope.

17:01.988 --> 17:04.622
You're the only one
out of the group

17:04.624 --> 17:06.691
who might not go home alone
tonight, Jess.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.192
Really?
- Yes.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.627
It's all on your shoulders.

17:09.629 --> 17:12.196
So the sex fist...

17:12.198 --> 17:14.632
has...

17:14.634 --> 17:16.134
turned into
a sex finger.

17:16.136 --> 17:18.036
Uh, don't... yeah.
- Sex finger.

17:21.640 --> 17:22.874
¶ ¶

17:22.876 --> 17:25.410
Hey. Ted. Um...

17:25.412 --> 17:27.678
(clears throat)
I'm out of moves, so...

17:27.680 --> 17:29.380
I'm just gonna try being myself.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.049
Here's some
stuff about me:

17:31.051 --> 17:32.383
I've never
cured anything.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.519
I'm a middle school
vice principal

17:34.521 --> 17:36.020
and I love my job.

17:36.022 --> 17:37.422
Um, I'm just getting
out of a relationship

17:37.424 --> 17:39.057
with a guy that
I still live with,

17:39.059 --> 17:40.725
which is kind of
complicated.

17:40.727 --> 17:41.526
He's over there.

17:41.528 --> 17:42.393
What's up, Nick?

17:42.395 --> 17:43.961
Hi, I'm Nick!

17:46.832 --> 17:49.333
Sometimes I cry
when newscasters

17:49.335 --> 17:51.035
wish each other
"Happy birthday" on air.

17:51.037 --> 17:53.938
My first crush
was on a Batman cake,

17:53.940 --> 17:56.908
but my first sexual feelings
were about Teenage Simba.

17:56.910 --> 17:59.610
'Cause he was super hot,

17:59.612 --> 18:02.113
and I still, actually,
find him hot.

18:02.115 --> 18:03.714
Uh, truth time. Um...

18:03.716 --> 18:05.116
So that's me.

18:05.118 --> 18:07.251
And if you want to
take me home, Ted,

18:07.253 --> 18:10.321
we can definitely do
some no-bra stuff.

18:11.723 --> 18:12.623
Uh...

18:12.625 --> 18:14.258
That's me naked.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.626
Well...

18:15.628 --> 18:16.961
...and this is me with

18:16.963 --> 18:20.198
a guy who I thought
was Larry King.

18:21.233 --> 18:22.366
So it's
decision time.

18:22.368 --> 18:24.268
Yeah, Ted, who's it gonna be?

18:24.270 --> 18:25.236
Me or Jess?

18:25.238 --> 18:27.438
(sighs)

18:34.546 --> 18:36.981
Hmm?

18:36.983 --> 18:39.217
TED:
<i>Ooh...</i>

18:39.219 --> 18:41.085
TED:
Wow. Hah.

18:41.087 --> 18:42.587
Ooh...

18:42.589 --> 18:45.990
This is tough.

18:45.992 --> 18:47.925
I mean, okay, 'cause
I mean, over here

18:47.927 --> 18:50.561
we've got, you know,
the whole... you know.

18:50.563 --> 18:52.396
And then, but of course over
here we got the... bing,

18:52.398 --> 18:53.397
and the... you know.

18:53.399 --> 18:54.966
Mmm...

18:54.968 --> 18:56.601
(groaning):
Oh, God, what do I do?

18:56.603 --> 18:58.002
What do I do?

18:58.004 --> 18:59.904
It's over.
- Moment's passed, Ted.

18:59.906 --> 19:01.239
Okay.

19:01.241 --> 19:03.174
I'll take him out.

19:03.176 --> 19:06.177
So you and
Buster broke up.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.879
Whew. I'm sorry.

19:09.815 --> 19:10.982
Yeah, I'm just waiting

19:10.984 --> 19:12.350
for you to do
something weird now.

19:12.352 --> 19:14.352
Yeah, I feel that
coming on, so, um...

19:14.354 --> 19:15.486
I'm gonna go.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.622
(sighs heavily)

19:17.624 --> 19:20.258
You know what doesn't
whine and cry

19:20.260 --> 19:21.993
is the sperm
in my freezer.

19:21.995 --> 19:23.594
I am counting
down the days

19:23.596 --> 19:26.264
until we don't
need men to procreate.

19:26.266 --> 19:28.199
If I really put
my mind to it...

19:28.201 --> 19:30.268
autumn 2018.

19:31.303 --> 19:33.938
Are you ready?

19:33.940 --> 19:35.840
Oh, it's my Plan "B."

19:35.842 --> 19:37.942
Yeah. Beats going home alone.

19:37.944 --> 19:39.610
Just giving her a ride.

19:39.612 --> 19:40.912
Nothing weird.

19:42.047 --> 19:43.814
(whispering):
We do this every time.

19:43.816 --> 19:46.651
So, Katherine, uh...
where do you live?

19:46.653 --> 19:48.786
About two inches north
of your mouth, Padre.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.054
Bye.

19:50.056 --> 19:51.255
Bye.

19:53.458 --> 19:55.293
SCHMIDT:
It's okay, Jess.

19:55.295 --> 19:56.994
Sex fist is obviously over.

19:56.996 --> 19:58.796
We're all going
home alone.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.965
Well, that's where
you're wrong, Schmidt.

20:00.967 --> 20:03.367
We're not going home alone.

20:04.336 --> 20:05.536
That's great.
All right.

20:05.538 --> 20:06.737
It's like that.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.343
"Regan, Kevin and Rebecca..."

20:12.345 --> 20:14.011
(laughing)

20:14.013 --> 20:15.246
"...request the honor
of your presence."

20:15.248 --> 20:17.648
How about the honor
of my garbage can?

20:17.650 --> 20:18.683
COACH:
Hey!

20:18.685 --> 20:20.218
JESS:
Those fridge people

20:20.220 --> 20:21.953
with their
stupid houses...

20:22.821 --> 20:23.988
Oh, look at
this one, guys.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.256
Uh, it looks like
Jeffrey and Lauren

20:25.258 --> 20:27.358
want us to share
in their joy.

20:27.360 --> 20:30.261
How about they share
in my chocolate pocket?

20:30.263 --> 20:31.229
(laughing):
What does that mean?

20:31.231 --> 20:32.363
In my butt.

20:32.365 --> 20:33.831
Mm-mm.
JESS:
That's gross.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.499
Yeah, I...

20:35.501 --> 20:37.268
(laughing)

20:37.270 --> 20:39.270
Oh, man... how about
this one, you guys?

20:39.272 --> 20:40.338
Scott and Derek.

20:40.340 --> 20:41.272
Yeah, real
tasteful wedding--

20:41.274 --> 20:42.873
for a Thursday!
- NICK:
Yeah.

20:42.875 --> 20:45.343
Oh, look at that--
Laurie and Mitchell.

20:45.345 --> 20:46.510
They had a cash bar.

20:46.512 --> 20:48.446
I hope they can't have kids!

20:48.448 --> 20:50.014
That's super dark, bro.

20:50.016 --> 20:51.282
That was too far.
I hope they can...
- Yeah!

20:51.284 --> 20:52.683
...I hope they can,
I hope they can.

20:52.685 --> 20:53.884
Cece and Shivrang...
you bastards,

20:53.886 --> 20:54.919
take that one down.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.287
You know what?
It's gone.

20:56.289 --> 20:57.588
(whoops)
- No...

20:57.590 --> 20:59.223
NICK:
Take that one down!
Oh, yeah.

20:59.225 --> 21:00.291
JESS:
Wait a minute.

21:00.293 --> 21:01.425
Who are Gabe and Stephanie,

21:01.427 --> 21:03.094
with the profile, these things?

21:03.096 --> 21:04.462
Oh, Gabe's the heavy guy with
the perm and the wheelchair...

21:04.464 --> 21:05.596
No, Gabe was the guy
on the motorcycle...

21:05.598 --> 21:07.365
No, no, no, no.
The guy with the perm.

21:07.367 --> 21:08.532
The guy who kept showing
his stomach the whole time.

21:08.534 --> 21:09.600
Oh.
- SCHMIDT:
That's the woman who was

21:09.602 --> 21:10.868
eight and a half months
pregnant.

21:10.870 --> 21:12.103
The groom was dressed
as the bride...

21:12.105 --> 21:13.237
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, uh...

21:13.239 --> 21:14.038
This wedding's next week.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.439
What?
- What?

21:15.441 --> 21:17.275
(all muttering)

21:17.277 --> 21:19.543
Not anymore.
SCHMIDT: Thank you.

21:19.545 --> 21:20.711
(whooping, cheering)

21:20.713 --> 21:22.046
Whoa!

21:22.048 --> 21:23.414
(all laughing)

21:23.416 --> 21:25.116
That's right!
- Come on, now!

21:25.118 --> 21:26.317
Ripping it up!

21:26.319 --> 21:28.286
(everyone talking at once)

21:28.288 --> 21:30.054
Oh! Oh!
- Look at that one.

21:30.056 --> 21:31.322
Rippin' 'em up.

21:31.324 --> 21:33.157
(whoops)

21:33.159 --> 21:34.625
Rip.
- Oh, right there.

21:34.627 --> 21:35.960
Yes.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.495
Mmm...

21:37.497 --> 21:39.430
(laughter and indistinct,
overlapping conversation)
