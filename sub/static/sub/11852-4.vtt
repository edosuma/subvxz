13:46.993 --> 13:51.089
...he‘ll D-l-E 01 old age in a tew days.

13:52.065 --> 13:53.692
We can‘t let that happen.

13:53.866 --> 13:55.663
I thought you didn‘t like him.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.268
-I don‘t.
-Oh.

13:59.105 --> 14:02.268
Hey, let‘s go get some more macaroni.

14:04.777 --> 14:07.507
-| just wanna help--
-Hey.

14:08.481 --> 14:09.880
But I‘m not sure we can.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.207
Here, take a look at this.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.444
These lines are
some kind ot neural mesh...

14:14.620 --> 14:17.987
...that have been surgically gratted
onto his brain and major nerves.

14:18.157 --> 14:20.785
Neural mesh? Can you take that out?

14:21.461 --> 14:22.792
It would kill him.

14:22.962 --> 14:26.693
And even it we could remove it,
lam not sure we should.

14:26.866 --> 14:30.700
Think ot him as a computer.
The mesh is sottware.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.436
-It tells him what to do?
-Uh....

14:32.605 --> 14:35.665
From my analysis, it‘s more like
it tells him how to do things.

14:35.842 --> 14:38.402
How to walk, talk, eat.

14:38.845 --> 14:41.837
-So he‘s like a robot?
-Oh, no. Not at all.

14:42.014 --> 14:43.276
He gets skills trom mesh...

14:43.449 --> 14:46.316
...but what he does with them
seems to be entirely up to him.

14:46.686 --> 14:48.813
He‘s, uh, got his own personality.

14:49.555 --> 14:50.988
Yeah, I noticed.

14:51.157 --> 14:54.285
Oh, I also tound a passkey biochip
embedded in the mesh.

14:54.460 --> 14:58.191
-Like the one we tound in the woman.
-Meaning they‘ve both been to Simcron.

14:58.364 --> 15:01.299
Well, we can make a pretty good guess
who put the mesh in.

15:01.467 --> 15:05.062
Why go through the trouble it he‘s just
gonna die in a tew days anyway?

15:06.672 --> 15:08.264
He‘s just a kid.

15:09.108 --> 15:12.236
A kid that doesn‘t know
what‘s happening to him or why...

15:12.412 --> 15:15.848
...doesn‘t understand that he‘s ditterent,
he‘s a metahuman.

to discover you‘re ditterent.

-The boy is an orphan...

the treatment is experimental.

26:29.655 --> 26:31.782

skills as he grows...

26:35.060 --> 26:38.188
...things like combat expertise.

-The active mode, on the other hand--
-Does what, stops the aging?

26:41.600 --> 26:43.431
No, I don‘t think so.

26:43.602 --> 26:46.036

into the part ol the brain...

26:46.205 --> 26:48.833
...that regulates violent behavior.

26:49.308 --> 26:54.541
It‘s obvious that he‘s been designed
as some kind ol assassin or warrior.

26:54.713 --> 26:58.114
Warrior, yes. Assassin?
We still don‘t have any prool ol that.

26:58.283 --> 27:01.741

27:02.221 --> 27:05.588
