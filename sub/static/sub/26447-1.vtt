WEBVTT

01:27.421 --> 01:29.537
Life
foundation control, this is lf1.

01:29.548 --> 01:32.255
The specimens are secured,
and we're heading home.

01:32.301 --> 01:34.587
Roger, lf1.
You are a go for reentry.

01:34.636 --> 01:37.503
Copy that.
Initiating reentry sequence.

01:37.514 --> 01:39.596
Point-four by 103-point...

01:39.600 --> 01:41.386
Oh, shit.

01:41.393 --> 01:43.008
Seal it off.
Seal it off!

01:43.061 --> 01:44.426
Lf1, mission control.

01:44.479 --> 01:46.060
You're breaking up.
Please repeat.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.017
Mayday, mayday, lf1/

01:48.025 --> 01:49.561
- mayday!
- Lf1, mission control.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.396
Please repeat.

01:51.445 --> 01:54.312
Lf1, mission control.
Please repeat.

02:43.288 --> 02:45.308
I don't want to have to wait
for full clean-up just to get

02:45.332 --> 02:47.018
- a status report.
- We're collecting this data

02:47.042 --> 02:49.020
- as quickly as possible.
- That's not good enough.

02:49.044 --> 02:50.580
Okay, maybe you can tell me
what happened.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.373
There was some kind of breach.
One of the astronauts

02:52.381 --> 02:54.747
- sent a distress call.
- What about the crew?

02:54.758 --> 02:58.376
- We're still investigating.
- Where did it go down?

02:58.387 --> 03:00.378
It's 20 kilometers west of sibu.

03:00.389 --> 03:02.596
Did we at least retrieve
all of the samples?

03:02.599 --> 03:04.385
No. We have
three of them.

03:04.393 --> 03:06.349
One of the organisms
got out of containment,

03:06.353 --> 03:10.016
and it's missing.
We don't know which one.

03:23.286 --> 03:24.446
What is she saying?

03:24.454 --> 03:27.196
One of the astronauts
is still alive.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.161
That's Jameson.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.787
- Morning, sunshine.
- What?

04:58.799 --> 05:00.835
I'm awake.

05:01.343 --> 05:02.628
Missed me.

05:02.677 --> 05:04.338
- I'm awake.
- Here you go.

05:04.387 --> 05:06.878
- You can have it back.
- Thank...

05:06.890 --> 05:09.927
Oh, wow,
you're wearing a suit. Yes!

05:09.935 --> 05:12.426
- I love it when you wear the suit.
- Thank you.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.723
I have depositions today
in the life foundation case.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.972
Hey, let me know
how your meeting goes.

05:16.983 --> 05:17.017
My meeting?

05:17.025 --> 05:18.606
My meeting?

05:18.652 --> 05:20.483
Oh, shit. Yeah.

05:20.487 --> 05:20.521
My meeting.

05:20.529 --> 05:22.986
My meeting.

05:26.409 --> 05:28.866
- Coffee.
- Oh. Mmm!

05:28.912 --> 05:30.777
- You are perfect.
- Thank you.

05:30.789 --> 05:32.654
Hey, you know what...
You know what night

05:32.707 --> 05:34.493
- it is tonight, right?
- Date night.

05:34.543 --> 05:37.455
Mmm-hmm. So, I will pick
you up around, uh, 6:00.

05:37.462 --> 05:39.874
And please do not forget
your helmet.

05:39.881 --> 05:41.462
Oh, I'm glad that you like it,

05:41.466 --> 05:42.956
'cause I plan on wearing it
at our wedding.

05:42.968 --> 05:44.674
That's hot.

05:44.719 --> 05:46.584
Feed the cat.

05:46.596 --> 05:47.881
I will.

05:47.889 --> 05:49.425
I love you!

05:49.432 --> 05:51.593
Love you, too.
Feed the cat.

06:09.953 --> 06:11.818
Eddie Brock
with boots on the ground

06:11.872 --> 06:14.409
today in the mission district,
chasing a lead into some...

06:14.457 --> 06:16.060
Everybody knows how
our silicon valley overlords

06:16.084 --> 06:18.325
at Google and Facebook...
Last time, I was poking around

06:18.336 --> 06:19.826
asking uncomfortable
questions...

06:19.838 --> 06:22.955
Homelessness is only increasing
nto the thousands...

06:22.966 --> 06:25.958
Eddie Brock here reporting
today from downtown Oakland,

06:25.969 --> 06:29.052
where massive demonstrations
have taken over the streets.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.592
I've been chasing
this real-estate bribery story

06:31.641 --> 06:33.723
for a few weeks now.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.718
This is gonna piss you off.
All being strong-armed...

06:35.729 --> 06:37.936
Medical examiner has yet
to determine cause of death,

06:37.939 --> 06:39.770
due to the condition
of the body,

06:39.816 --> 06:42.353
but you don't wind up
at the bottom of a /andfil//

06:42.360 --> 06:45.477
due to natural causes,
so it seems that the city

06:45.530 --> 06:48.988
doesn't care about these people
any more than the killer does.

06:48.992 --> 06:51.859
I'm Eddie Brock,
and this is the Brock report.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.698
Hey, Richard!

06:53.705 --> 06:56.321
- Lookin' good!
- Eddie, you can't park there, bro.

06:56.374 --> 06:58.456
Come on, man. There's
no such thing as can't.

06:58.460 --> 06:59.700
How'd she do?

06:59.753 --> 07:02.620
Berkeley. Brown. Mit.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.650
- She's got a scholarship, bro.
- What'd I tell you?

07:04.674 --> 07:06.335
You told me what?

07:06.384 --> 07:08.670
- No such thing as can't.
- Eddie.

07:09.346 --> 07:10.631
The bike.

07:10.680 --> 07:14.047
Mit! Whoo!

07:14.059 --> 07:17.517
You know what I love
about this view?

07:17.520 --> 07:20.353
- It never gets old.
- Yeah, well, uh...

07:20.357 --> 07:23.019
Height's not really my thing.

07:23.026 --> 07:25.563
But, uh...
What's the deal?

07:25.612 --> 07:27.944
- I got you the big one, exclusive.
- Yeah? Who?

07:27.989 --> 07:29.570
Carlton Drake.

07:29.616 --> 07:31.607
- Carlton Drake?
- The man's a visionary.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.821
He wants to talk
about his rockets,

07:33.828 --> 07:36.535
assure everyone they're safe,
that the crash was an anomaly.

07:36.539 --> 07:37.870
Uh...

07:37.916 --> 07:39.872
He's... he's seriously off.

07:39.918 --> 07:41.579
I'm gonna level with you.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.994
Carlton Drake could buy us
with his pocket cash,

07:44.005 --> 07:47.418
turn this building into his
own garage if he so wished.

07:47.425 --> 07:50.417
Now, you're just gonna ask him
about his space program,

07:50.428 --> 07:53.420
you're gonna thank him, and
you're gonna bid him a nice day.

07:54.432 --> 07:57.765
He's a crook.

07:57.769 --> 08:00.932
Eddie, when you had nowhere
to go, we gave you a home.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.347
Now, you know we love
the Eddie Brock show.

08:03.358 --> 08:06.065
There isn't a better investigative
reporter working today,

08:06.069 --> 08:07.809
but no one is above the network.

08:07.821 --> 08:10.904
So do me a favor, Eddie,
don't start your shit again.

08:10.907 --> 08:12.568
All right, all right.

08:12.617 --> 08:16.951
- For me.
- All right. I'll do it.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.612
I don't know why he gave
me this assignment, Annie.

08:18.623 --> 08:20.409
It's not...
It's not what I do.

08:20.458 --> 08:21.948
Well, my mother always told me

08:21.960 --> 08:24.918
that anything in life worth
having would take sacrifice...

08:24.921 --> 08:26.331
- Mmm-hmm.
- Patience...

08:26.381 --> 08:28.542
- Mmm.
- And be a lot of work.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.001
- Oh.
- That's you...

08:30.010 --> 08:31.671
- That's not.
- That I'm talking about.

08:31.678 --> 08:32.837
- Nah.
- Yeah.

08:32.886 --> 08:34.073
Well, you're lucky to have me.

08:34.097 --> 08:36.053
To be fair, I'm quite a catch.

08:36.099 --> 08:38.510
That's what my mom told me.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.551
Are you gonna
behave yourself tomorrow?

08:40.562 --> 08:43.770
No. No, I'm gonna do my job.
That's what I'm gonna do.

08:43.815 --> 08:45.851
I can't, you know,
not do my job.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.731
The guy you work for
is a complete...

08:47.736 --> 08:49.772
I don't work for Drake.
I work for my firm,

08:49.821 --> 08:51.402
and my firm works for him.

08:51.448 --> 08:53.905
And I'm sure
that they defend many people

08:53.908 --> 08:56.991
that you don't deem worthy,
but we don't want a repeat.

08:56.995 --> 08:59.737
- A repeat?
- Of the daily globe incident.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.495
Ow! Really?

09:01.499 --> 09:03.330
- Incident? That's not an incident.
- Mmm-hmm.

09:03.334 --> 09:04.603
- Baby, you were run out of New York.
- It was not. I did not.

09:04.627 --> 09:05.992
I don't want you
run out of San Francisco.

09:06.004 --> 09:08.495
No, I still have
currency in New York.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.789
I was going places.

09:10.842 --> 09:11.922
I wasn't running.

09:11.926 --> 09:13.666
I was going places.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.506
In fact, I moved
to San Francisco for you.

09:15.555 --> 09:18.672
- Me?
- You are my home.

09:18.725 --> 09:22.013
You're not so bad yourself,
champ.

09:24.939 --> 09:27.100
- Less talking, more kissing.
- All right.

09:27.108 --> 09:28.973
Let's just get the check.

09:55.970 --> 09:58.632
I'm gonna get a drink.

10:42.267 --> 10:44.303
Shh.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.237
Very soon,
another life foundation rocket

11:02.287 --> 11:04.824
will be sent
on an exploratory mission.

11:04.831 --> 11:08.073
And that's how, one day,
we might all live in space.

11:08.126 --> 11:10.788
Cool, huh? And now that I've shown you

11:10.795 --> 11:12.911
some of the cool stuff
that we do here,

11:12.964 --> 11:15.205
I'm hoping I've inspired
each and every one of you

11:15.216 --> 11:17.377
to go out there
and create things that others

11:17.427 --> 11:19.793
- have only dreamt of.
- Mr. Drake?

11:19.804 --> 11:22.841
- Shh!
- It's okay. Don't silence her.

11:22.891 --> 11:24.802
Come here. What's your name?

11:24.809 --> 11:26.800
- Allie.
- It's okay, Allie.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.639
You know, sometimes
that's what people do.

11:28.646 --> 11:31.103
They try and silence
those of us who ask questions.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.143
But you know what?
In the end,

11:33.193 --> 11:36.105
we're the ones
who change the world.

11:36.112 --> 11:39.024
Take good care of that, Allie.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.772
Guys, this is Dr. skirth.

11:40.825 --> 11:42.156
- Say hi.
- Hi.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.366
Hello, kids.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.405
Um, sorry to interrupt,

11:45.413 --> 11:47.745
but it's time to get changed
for your interview.

11:47.790 --> 11:49.951
Yeah. Uh, kids,
sorry to leave you.

11:49.959 --> 11:52.245
Allie, you're in charge.
High five up top.

11:52.295 --> 11:55.708
Dr. skirth will answer Allie's
question, and any others.

11:55.757 --> 11:55.791
- See you next time, guys. Bye!
- Bye!

11:55.798 --> 11:57.629
- See you next time, guys. Bye!
- Bye!

11:57.634 --> 11:59.670
What do you say,
Mr. Drake,

11:59.677 --> 12:01.383
we just start at the beginning?

12:01.429 --> 12:03.636
- Born to British parents.
- Mmm-hmm.

12:03.681 --> 12:06.969
And then at 19, you
discovered a gene therapy

12:06.976 --> 12:09.763
that literally doubles
the life expectancy

12:09.771 --> 12:11.261
- of pancreatic cancer patients.
- Well, actually,

12:11.272 --> 12:13.638
it tripled their
life expectancy.

12:13.650 --> 12:15.311
But it's okay.

12:15.318 --> 12:18.310
Okay, um, 24.
That's still extremely young.

12:18.363 --> 12:20.319
All right, you create

12:20.365 --> 12:22.026
- the life foundation!
- It didn't happen overnight.

12:22.033 --> 12:23.694
- And then...
- Rockets.

12:23.701 --> 12:25.908
You then decide,
like any normal human being,

12:25.954 --> 12:27.910
that you're gonna go
and explore space.

12:27.956 --> 12:30.242
You know what it is?
I have always believed...

12:30.250 --> 12:30.284
- Uh-huh.
- That space exploration

12:30.291 --> 12:32.031
- uh-huh.
- That space exploration

12:32.085 --> 12:33.666
is crucial in our quest to cure

12:33.670 --> 12:35.581
everything that ails us
here on earth.

12:35.630 --> 12:37.166
But if you think about
everything we've found...

12:37.173 --> 12:38.609
- Uh-huh.
- In the oceans and on land,

12:38.633 --> 12:40.498
- isn't it time to look up there?
- Mmm-hmm.

12:40.551 --> 12:43.008
To this plethora
of untapped resources?

12:43.054 --> 12:44.531
And you have a plethora
of untapped resources, also,

12:44.555 --> 12:46.341
from your pharmaceutical
companies

12:46.391 --> 12:48.160
that you're involved with,
you know, to help you realize

12:48.184 --> 12:49.370
- that ambition, I suppose.
- Of course.

12:49.394 --> 12:50.679
- Yeah.
- Full circle.

12:50.728 --> 12:52.969
So, I have to ask,
how does that work,

12:53.022 --> 12:54.603
you know, exactly,
the life foundation thing?

12:54.607 --> 12:56.598
How does it...
How does it, um...

12:56.609 --> 12:58.520
I don't know,
how does it go about,

12:58.569 --> 13:01.606
- say, testing pharmaceuticals?
- Eddie, we're talking

13:01.614 --> 13:03.445
- about the rocket here.
- No, I'm not. I'm not.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.405
I'm talking
about the allegations.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.032
- I'm sorry, I don't...
- It says that

13:07.036 --> 13:08.526
your entire empire
has been built

13:08.538 --> 13:10.574
- on dead bodies.
- Eddie.

13:10.623 --> 13:13.035
It's true, right?
It says that you recruit

13:13.042 --> 13:15.203
the most vulnerable of us
to volunteer for tests...

13:15.253 --> 13:16.653
- Hmm.
- That more often than not

13:18.131 --> 13:19.621
yeah, I'm aware
of these rumors online.

13:19.632 --> 13:20.997
There's a lot of fake news
out there these days.

13:21.009 --> 13:22.419
Right. What about
the legal cases?

13:22.468 --> 13:24.004
Sorry?

13:24.012 --> 13:26.128
Uh, the actual legal cases,
like Sarah chambers,

13:26.139 --> 13:28.075
- Phil barclay, rob MacDonald.
- That's it. Time to go.

13:28.099 --> 13:29.410
Thank you so much for coming
to talk to me, Mr. Brock.

13:29.434 --> 13:31.015
And they're just some
of the people who walked

13:31.019 --> 13:32.975
- through these doors...
- Have a nice day.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.682
- Cut the camera off, please.
- Thank you very much.

13:34.689 --> 13:36.375
- Time is up. Come on.
- They're dead. The dead...

13:36.399 --> 13:37.626
- Could you show him out, please?
- The dead found...

13:37.650 --> 13:39.436
Don't touch me.
The dead foundation thing.

13:39.444 --> 13:40.308
- Get out of here, Brock.
- We're not finished.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.150
Yes, you are, Mr. Brock.

13:41.195 --> 13:42.025
Is that a threat?

13:42.030 --> 13:44.271
Have a nice life.

13:46.242 --> 13:49.325
I know what
you're going to say, but...

13:49.370 --> 13:51.986
This guy, he is
all the way bad, Jack.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.031
- If you just give...
- Who's your source?

13:54.042 --> 13:57.159
- Excuse me?
- Who's your source, Eddie?

14:01.007 --> 14:03.999
I don't have a source, per se.
But I have a hunch.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.966
This isn't the wild wild west.

14:05.970 --> 14:08.677
We don't go off half-cocked
based on a hunch.

14:08.723 --> 14:10.259
We do the work.

14:10.308 --> 14:12.970
We substantiate our accusations.

14:12.977 --> 14:15.013
We provide evidence.

14:15.063 --> 14:18.976
You know, for a smart guy,
you really are a dumb-ass.

14:24.655 --> 14:26.270
You're fired, Eddie.

14:26.324 --> 14:28.280
I can't trust you.

14:28.326 --> 14:30.942
Have a nice life.

14:30.953 --> 14:33.285
- Will just take a second.
- Okay.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.575
Hey.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.574
You are pathologically
self-absorbed.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.104
Annie. Annie,
can you talk to me first?

14:39.128 --> 14:40.117
Your ego requires
constant attention,

14:40.129 --> 14:42.211
and you're stubborn as hell.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.443
But I was willing to roll with
it, Eddie, because I loved you.

14:44.467 --> 14:47.209
You "loved" me?
What is that supposed to mean?

14:48.596 --> 14:51.212
What you did got me fired.

14:52.100 --> 14:54.056
You used me.

15:00.358 --> 15:04.101
Annie? Annie.

15:36.144 --> 15:38.726
Oh, my god.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.853
You're beautiful.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.182
Test 36.

17:42.186 --> 17:43.722
Biological interactions

17:43.729 --> 17:46.015
between two different organisms.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.647
These creatures need to bond
with a respiratory host

17:48.651 --> 17:50.642
in order to survive
for any amount of time

17:50.695 --> 17:52.526
in an oxygen-rich environment.

17:52.530 --> 17:53.940
Well, why are all these hosts

17:53.948 --> 17:55.484
showing this hyper-acute
rejection?

17:55.491 --> 17:55.525
That's what
we're trying to find out.

17:55.533 --> 17:58.024
That's what
we're trying to find out.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.286
The bonding process is starting.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.792
It's equalizing.

18:14.343 --> 18:17.210
But why? Why this rabbit?

18:17.263 --> 18:19.925
- It's similar to an organ transplant.
- Huh.

18:19.974 --> 18:22.681
Where the donor and recipient
must be an exact match?

18:22.685 --> 18:25.222
- That's correct.
- Okay. So wait, think about it.

18:25.271 --> 18:29.105
If we do achieve symbiosis, they
should be able to survive here,

18:29.150 --> 18:33.393
but also we would
be able to survive there.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.107
"We"?

18:35.114 --> 18:37.230
- Begin human trials.
- Oh, it's way too soon

18:37.241 --> 18:39.197
to even begin to think
about something like...

18:39.243 --> 18:40.637
Dr. skirth, you're at the forefront
of a scientific breakthrough.

18:40.661 --> 18:43.118
I need you to hold your nerve.
All right?

18:43.164 --> 18:44.950
I understand,
but it's an ethical question.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.685
Think of future generations.
Think of your kids.

18:46.709 --> 18:49.121
Hey, how are your kids?

18:50.588 --> 18:52.078
Let's begin human trials.

18:52.089 --> 18:53.795
Good work.

19:15.529 --> 19:17.235
Hey, Jack.

19:18.366 --> 19:20.607
Do you ever feel like your life

19:20.618 --> 19:24.236
- is like one monumental screwup?
- Nope.

19:24.246 --> 19:25.986
Here at the life foundation,

19:25.998 --> 19:26.032
- we've always believed...
- Isn't that your buddy?

19:26.040 --> 19:28.018
- We've always believed...
- Isn't that your buddy?

19:28.042 --> 19:29.478
In finding the lessons
in our disappointments.

19:29.502 --> 19:29.536
In the months
since our rocket failed,

19:29.543 --> 19:31.158
in the months
since our rocket failed,

19:31.212 --> 19:32.702
we've learned so much.

19:32.713 --> 19:35.955
Do you think we could,
like, switch him off?

19:35.966 --> 19:37.422
Some people
are trying to watch that.

19:37.426 --> 19:38.962
Oh, you are, are you?

19:38.969 --> 19:41.881
- Yeah?
- Aren't you Eddie Brock?

19:43.224 --> 19:44.930
I used to be.

19:44.975 --> 19:46.590
We take
the same view of progress.

19:46.644 --> 19:49.226
Thrilled to announce
that the life foundation

19:49.271 --> 19:52.183
has now begun preparations
on [Ts next launch.

19:52.233 --> 19:53.598
All right, Jack,
this is for you.

19:53.651 --> 19:55.562
I do not want you
to spend it all at once.

19:55.611 --> 19:57.602
I'm going to go home and chase
myself around the room,

19:57.613 --> 20:00.195
playing hard to get.

20:03.244 --> 20:05.075
- Hey, Maria.
- Eddie.

20:05.121 --> 20:07.703
- How's it going?
- Righteous, Eddie.

20:07.748 --> 20:10.330
Oh! Yeah, we're empty.

20:12.461 --> 20:14.076
Cost you $5.

20:14.088 --> 20:16.204
$5 for a paper that's free?

20:16.215 --> 20:18.206
I walked all the way over
to the vending machine,

20:18.217 --> 20:21.004
got the papers out and
brought 'em back over here,

20:21.011 --> 20:23.468
so you can have 'em
personally delivered to you.

20:23.514 --> 20:23.548
You did that for me?

20:23.556 --> 20:24.545
You did that for me?

20:24.557 --> 20:26.764
- Yes, I did.
- Oh.

20:27.685 --> 20:30.222
- Five bucks.
- That's pretty steep.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.641
Tell you what, you give
me a dollar for a song,

20:32.690 --> 20:34.305
I'll throw in the paper.

20:34.316 --> 20:37.058
I'll tell you what,
I will give you 20 bucks,

20:37.069 --> 20:39.105
but not to sing, all right?

20:39.155 --> 20:40.270
Deal.

20:40.281 --> 20:42.192
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

20:42.199 --> 20:45.987
No. You're welcome.

20:46.036 --> 20:48.277
Hey, Mrs. chen.

20:48.330 --> 20:50.571
- How you doing, Eddie?
- Ah, aches and pains,

20:50.583 --> 20:52.574
you know, aches and pains.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.371
You look like shit.

20:54.670 --> 20:56.126
Excuse me?

20:56.172 --> 20:58.083
You look like shit.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.707
And you look
as beautiful as ever.

21:01.719 --> 21:04.426
- Jesus.
- Mind is body, Eddie.

21:04.472 --> 21:06.303
Have you been meditating
like I showed you?

21:06.348 --> 21:08.326
- No, I have not. And it does not work.
- It doesn't work,

21:08.350 --> 21:10.454
- because you don't give it a chance.
- No, it doesn't work,

21:10.478 --> 21:13.641
because I bought a DVD off your
cousin, and it was in mandarin.

21:13.689 --> 21:16.431
Yeah, I don't understand that, either.

21:16.484 --> 21:18.190
See, that right there, I don't
understand what you just said.

21:18.194 --> 21:19.934
That is the problem.

21:24.325 --> 21:27.192
Bottle of whiskey,
and don't forget my change.

21:27.244 --> 21:29.610
Please.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.078
Let's go.

21:31.081 --> 21:33.163
Before the price goes up
for my protection.

21:35.419 --> 21:38.627
The full payment is due.
Now.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.713
Make sure you have
my money ready, chen.

21:40.758 --> 21:42.999
I don't like to wait.

22:00.611 --> 22:02.272
Life hurts, Eddie.

22:02.446 --> 22:04.277
It just does.

22:21.048 --> 22:24.006
I gotta go.

22:24.051 --> 22:28.670
- Okay. Love you, babe.
- See you, babe.

22:31.517 --> 22:33.303
What a dick.

23:02.256 --> 23:04.042
I'm not even
asking to staff there.

23:04.049 --> 23:05.585
Why would I do that?
I can't use my name.

23:05.593 --> 23:07.049
I can use a pseudonym.

23:08.554 --> 23:11.136
I could be a woman.
Have you seen 7ootsie?

23:16.353 --> 23:17.433
I'll call you back.

23:17.438 --> 23:19.895
Okay, I won't. Thank you. Bye.

23:25.321 --> 23:30.691
Realize deeply that the
present moment is all you ever have.

23:30.743 --> 23:34.531
Make the now the primary
focus of your life.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.992
Any action is often better
than no action,

23:37.041 --> 23:38.656
especially if you
have been stuck

23:38.667 --> 23:42.376
in an unhappy situation
for a long time.

23:42.421 --> 23:45.379
If it is a mistake, at least
you learned something,

23:45.424 --> 23:47.631
in which case it's no longer...

24:06.528 --> 24:09.235
Thank you all for
bringing us to this moment.

24:09.281 --> 24:13.695
Our names will be spoken
long after we are dust.

24:13.702 --> 24:15.943
History starts now.

24:16.330 --> 24:18.036
This is day one.

24:18.082 --> 24:21.700
This is first contact.

24:21.752 --> 24:24.664
Let's get to work.

24:36.934 --> 24:39.641
Establishing subject baseline.

24:41.105 --> 24:43.972
All vital signs are normal.

24:50.030 --> 24:52.112
Put me through.

24:52.157 --> 24:54.569
There's no need to be
frightened, Isaac.

24:56.412 --> 24:57.743
There's no need.

24:57.788 --> 25:00.780
Isaac. You know
that's a biblical name?

25:00.791 --> 25:02.827
Yes, sir.

25:02.835 --> 25:04.951
God said to Abraham,
"give me your son,

25:04.962 --> 25:07.669
"show me you are willing
to sacrifice the one thing

25:07.715 --> 25:10.832
"most precious to you,"
and Abraham was willing.

25:10.884 --> 25:12.920
You know what's always
impressed me about that story?

25:12.928 --> 25:16.591
It isn't Abraham's sacrifice.
It's Isaac's.

25:20.644 --> 25:23.511
Now, I don't know what kind of
god would ask that of someone,

25:23.522 --> 25:24.874
but it doesn't change
anything for me.

25:24.898 --> 25:29.642
Isaac is still the hero
of this story.

25:29.695 --> 25:32.562
Look around you.
Look at the world.

25:32.573 --> 25:34.029
What do you see?
War, poverty,

25:34.033 --> 25:36.365
a planet on the brink
of collapse.

25:36.410 --> 25:39.447
I would argue that god
has abandoned us.

25:39.496 --> 25:41.099
He didn't keep
his end of the bargain, Isaac,

25:41.123 --> 25:44.115
so now it's down to you and me
to put this right.

25:44.126 --> 25:47.243
And this time, Isaac, we can.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.665
We will.

25:52.676 --> 25:56.339
This time,
I will not abandon us.

25:58.098 --> 25:59.713
Yes.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.597
Open it.

26:15.991 --> 26:18.073
What the hell is that?
What? No, what...

26:18.118 --> 26:19.824
Please let me... no.

26:19.828 --> 26:22.570
Oh, please, please, please!

26:39.431 --> 26:42.093
His vitals are holding steady.

26:42.142 --> 26:44.804
- Where the hell did it go?
- Incredible.

26:44.853 --> 26:46.969
Where did it go?

26:51.026 --> 26:53.142
Where is [7

27:30.566 --> 27:32.431
bring in the next volunteer.

28:00.888 --> 28:03.550
You know,
I used to be a reporter.

28:03.599 --> 28:04.964
I was...

28:04.975 --> 28:07.682
I was pretty successful,
as well, you know?

28:07.728 --> 28:07.762
I was pretty successful,
as well, you know?

28:07.769 --> 28:11.853
My job, it required you to...
You know, to follow people

28:11.899 --> 28:17.394
that did not want to be followed
and hide in plain sight.

28:17.404 --> 28:18.940
I mean...

28:18.989 --> 28:21.355
You have to know
how to disappear.

28:22.492 --> 28:25.825
I was pretty good, but,
you know, you...

28:25.871 --> 28:28.362
Whoever you are, you suck.

28:28.790 --> 28:30.701
Okay.

28:30.751 --> 28:30.785
- Uh, my name is dora skirth.
- Mmm.

28:30.792 --> 28:32.783
- Uh, my name is dora skirth.
- Mmm.

28:32.794 --> 28:34.125
I need your help.

28:34.171 --> 28:35.832
- I work at the life foundation.
- You do?

28:35.839 --> 28:37.545
- Yes.
- Wow. Good for you.

28:37.591 --> 28:39.547
We're done.

28:39.593 --> 28:41.174
No...

28:41.178 --> 28:44.466
Mr. Brock, please...
Please listen to me.

28:44.514 --> 28:46.550
Everything that you
accused him of,

28:46.600 --> 28:47.885
you were right.
It's all true.

28:47.935 --> 28:49.425
- I don't care anymore.
- Really?

28:49.436 --> 28:51.472
Because he's got a lab
filled with poor people,

28:51.521 --> 28:53.833
and they're all signing waivers
that they don't understand,

28:53.857 --> 28:55.643
and he's using them
like Guinea pigs,

28:55.692 --> 28:57.728
and they are dying.

28:57.736 --> 28:57.770
They are all dying.

28:57.778 --> 28:59.814
They are all dying.

28:59.863 --> 29:01.979
- You've seen that?
- Yes.

29:02.366 --> 29:04.152
Come here.

29:05.619 --> 29:06.779
Why would I believe you?

29:06.828 --> 29:07.943
Because it's true.

29:07.996 --> 29:09.736
I believed in him, and I...

29:09.748 --> 29:09.782
I told myself
that it was worth it

29:09.790 --> 29:11.655
I told myself
that it was worth it

29:11.667 --> 29:13.828
because we were curing cancer,
but now this is different.

29:13.835 --> 29:15.371
- Something else.
- Go to the cops.

29:15.420 --> 29:16.705
I can't do that.

29:16.713 --> 29:18.499
I'm afraid of what
will happen to my family.

29:18.507 --> 29:20.122
He's a very dangerous man, and
he's a very powerful man...

29:20.133 --> 29:21.794
I know, I know
how dangerous he is,

29:21.802 --> 29:23.463
because the very first time
I interviewed him,

29:23.470 --> 29:25.631
just once, I lose my job
the very next day.

29:25.681 --> 29:28.013
I lost my career,
I lost my relationship,

29:28.058 --> 29:30.800
I lost my apartment, I lost
everything I ever cared about.

29:30.811 --> 29:33.678
You know why? Carlton Drake
ruined me. Finished.

29:34.564 --> 29:36.600
Now, if you are
who you say you are,

29:36.650 --> 29:38.936
genuinely, and you have proof,

29:38.944 --> 29:41.981
then you should be
very, very, very afraid.

29:42.030 --> 29:44.021
I am.

29:44.032 --> 29:46.023
You need to find yourself another
white knight, Ms. skirth,

29:46.034 --> 29:47.490
because I am done.

29:47.536 --> 29:49.447
I am done with all of this shit.

29:49.746 --> 29:51.077
What shit?

29:51.123 --> 29:54.035
All of this "saving my
fellow man" shit.

29:54.084 --> 29:56.200
All right? Good night.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.395
Eddie?

30:17.899 --> 30:19.389
Well, hey. Whoa.

30:19.401 --> 30:22.438
Anne, I was just walking by,
and, uh...

30:22.446 --> 30:23.731
I saw Mr. Belvedere.

30:23.780 --> 30:25.520
I felt concerned for
his welfare, so...

30:25.532 --> 30:27.363
Eddie...

30:27.409 --> 30:28.945
This is Dan.

30:28.994 --> 30:30.985
- Dan, this is Eddie.
- Yeah.

30:31.038 --> 30:32.744
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

30:32.748 --> 30:32.782
- Yeah.
- Annie's told me a lot about you.

30:32.789 --> 30:34.404
- Yeah.
- Annie's told me a lot about you.

30:34.416 --> 30:35.451
- Really?
- Yeah.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.456
I'm a big fan of your work.

30:37.502 --> 30:39.788
- Thank you.
- Really?

30:39.838 --> 30:42.580
It's pretty cool, all the
people that he took down.

30:42.924 --> 30:45.040
Yeah, I was one of them.

30:46.636 --> 30:47.967
Well, look,
I'll let you guys catch up.

30:47.971 --> 30:50.178
- So I'll see you inside?
- You're the best.

30:51.600 --> 30:54.057
- Really nice meeting you, man.
- Uh, you, too.

31:00.525 --> 31:03.267
He has a key. You know he has a key?

31:03.820 --> 31:06.607
Yeah. How else
would he get in?

31:07.949 --> 31:11.487
Yeah. Well, uh...

31:11.536 --> 31:13.902
So, uh, what you up to?

31:13.914 --> 31:17.077
You realize that's light-years away
from being any of your business, right?

31:17.125 --> 31:19.707
Hey, well, just asking,
you know.

31:20.379 --> 31:22.711
So, is Dan, uh, a lawyer?

31:22.714 --> 31:24.670
No, he's a doctor.

31:24.674 --> 31:27.290
- Surgeon, actually.
- Oh.

31:28.095 --> 31:29.676
How's Mr. Belvedere, anyway?

31:29.721 --> 31:31.131
I would say that he misses you,

31:31.139 --> 31:32.879
but that would be bullshit,
'cause...

31:32.933 --> 31:34.594
- He's a cat.
- No, because he never liked you.

31:34.601 --> 31:36.011
No, he's a cat,
and cats don't like anyone.

31:36.019 --> 31:38.351
You look good, by the way.
You doing good?

31:38.397 --> 31:39.582
What are you doing here, Eddie?

31:39.606 --> 31:41.221
I'm here 'cause I miss you.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.598
A lot.

31:43.652 --> 31:45.046
You know, we were gonna
get married.

31:45.070 --> 31:47.607
That wasn't so long ago,
and now, you know...

31:47.614 --> 31:50.105
I can't really believe
that we're not...

31:51.451 --> 31:54.488
Are we gonna try
and find our way back?

31:54.871 --> 31:56.987
No, we can't.

31:58.959 --> 32:01.120
You did this, Eddie.

32:02.462 --> 32:05.078
Not Carlton Drake,
not the network.

32:05.132 --> 32:06.747
You.

33:13.325 --> 33:14.861
Uh, hello.
This is Dr. skirth.

33:14.910 --> 33:16.866
Yes, Eddie Brock here.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.702
Talk to me.

33:23.043 --> 33:25.204
Are you sure this is gonna work?

33:25.212 --> 33:27.123
Just stay down
and shut up, please.

33:28.840 --> 33:32.003
535.5,
win-909 rpm.

33:37.182 --> 33:38.467
Whew.

33:38.475 --> 33:41.012
Overpopulation
and climate change.

33:41.061 --> 33:43.177
These are two things
that Drake cannot control.

33:43.188 --> 33:45.144
Yeah, got it, right.

33:45.148 --> 33:48.140
We are literally a generation
away from an uninhabitable earth.

33:48.193 --> 33:50.980
- Uh, yeah.
- Drake is using his personal rockets

33:51.029 --> 33:53.111
to scout real estate.

33:53.114 --> 33:54.945
You know, it's a really
interesting story,

33:54.991 --> 33:57.107
but we need to just get to the
part where he's killing people.

33:57.118 --> 34:00.155
Drake sent a ship
on a recon mission.

34:00.205 --> 34:02.992
On the way back,
they found a comet.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.282
A comet?

34:05.335 --> 34:08.371
Onboard computers indicated the presence
of life, of millions of organisms.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.315
Wait, wait, wait, when you
say "millions of organisms,"

34:10.340 --> 34:12.109
- what do you mean?
- We brought back some specimens.

34:12.132 --> 34:13.748
You're talking about aliens?

34:13.802 --> 34:16.168
Like, aliens?

34:16.179 --> 34:17.543
E.T. Phone home.

34:17.556 --> 34:19.262
Aliens, yeah.

34:19.306 --> 34:21.797
Yes.

34:21.810 --> 34:23.596
But we don't call them that.

34:24.853 --> 34:26.844
- We call them symbiotes.
- Symbiotes?

34:26.898 --> 34:29.514
And they cannot survive in
our environment without help.

34:29.568 --> 34:33.982
Drake believes that the union
between human and symbiote

34:34.030 --> 34:36.862
is the key to our survival,
but not here on earth.

34:36.908 --> 34:41.322
Drake is trying to put human
beings and aliens together?

34:41.371 --> 34:42.827
So they can live in space?

34:42.871 --> 34:44.237
We call them hosts.

34:44.291 --> 34:47.078
That's nuts, isn't it?
That's completely insane.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.167
Yes. There's no protocol
for this thing.

34:49.170 --> 34:50.409
He's just feeding them in.

34:50.463 --> 34:52.418
If the match isn't exact...

34:52.424 --> 34:54.085
Elevators patrol check.

34:57.470 --> 34:59.335
Please, just go in.
Don't touch anything.

34:59.347 --> 35:01.547
- I won't. I won't.
- Go, go, go. I'll take care of him.

35:03.810 --> 35:05.175
Dr. skirth.

35:05.186 --> 35:06.471
I thought you'd all gone home.

35:06.479 --> 35:09.596
Oh, yes. Well, you know
what they say.

35:10.275 --> 35:12.015
Science never sleeps.

36:19.427 --> 36:22.089
- Eddie! It's me. Let me out!
- Maria? Maria?

36:22.138 --> 36:23.878
- Please! Let me out!
- I don't know how to get you...

36:23.890 --> 36:27.007
- Let me out. Out.
- I don't know how.

36:27.060 --> 36:28.721
Oh, my god.

36:42.492 --> 36:44.778
Oh, god! Maria, no! Maria!

36:44.786 --> 36:47.493
Maria! No, Maria, no!

36:58.425 --> 37:00.211
There has been a
security breach in lab sector 3.

37:00.218 --> 37:01.549
Oh, no. Maria?

37:01.553 --> 37:04.010
Maria! Oh, shit.

37:04.013 --> 37:07.881
Repeat, this is
a code silver security breach.

37:07.934 --> 37:11.973
All security personnel, please
respond to lab sector 3.

37:12.814 --> 37:14.975
Freeze!

37:45.889 --> 37:47.550
Got eyes on!

38:01.946 --> 38:03.186
Gol

38:03.239 --> 38:04.979
go! Gol

38:15.960 --> 38:17.370
where the hell'd he go?

38:17.420 --> 38:18.876
- I'm not seeing him.
- Fan out.

38:18.880 --> 38:21.337
- Find him.
- Nothing. Nothing yet.

38:21.382 --> 38:24.340
Search team 4, search team 4.

38:33.311 --> 38:36.178
Backtrack 200 feet east.

38:39.400 --> 38:40.890
This is dora.
Leave a message.

38:40.944 --> 38:43.731
Skirth, yeah, it's me.
I just got back.

38:43.780 --> 38:45.816
Are you all right?
I haven't heard from you,

38:45.824 --> 38:47.485
so I want to know
if you're all right.

38:47.534 --> 38:49.365
But, yeah, that was
a great call on the lab.

38:49.410 --> 38:51.321
You're absolutely right.

38:51.329 --> 38:52.694
Yeah. Listen.

38:52.747 --> 38:55.033
I got a... I got a guy.

38:55.083 --> 38:57.415
I'm gonna call him and, uh...

38:57.961 --> 38:59.952
Mmm. Oh...

39:00.004 --> 39:00.038
Oh, I got a bunch of
photographs.

39:00.046 --> 39:02.002
Oh, I got a bunch of
photographs.

39:02.048 --> 39:04.539
He will publish those photographs,
but I need you to come with me.

39:04.551 --> 39:07.167
Uh, could you just call me back?
Call me back.

39:11.307 --> 39:13.889
Whoa.

39:30.743 --> 39:32.449
Yeah.

39:33.288 --> 39:34.653
Mmm.

39:51.389 --> 39:53.471
What is wrong with me?

39:59.772 --> 40:01.979
Eddie.

40:10.742 --> 40:12.733
How bad?

40:12.785 --> 40:13.945
It's bad.

40:13.953 --> 40:15.489
How bad?

40:15.496 --> 40:15.530
Well, we assume
the intruder took it.

40:15.538 --> 40:18.530
Well, we assume
the intruder took it.

40:19.959 --> 40:22.416
Took it? Took it?

40:23.546 --> 40:25.707
We don't know what happened.

40:25.757 --> 40:27.693
I want to speak to every man
who was on duty last night.

40:27.717 --> 40:28.819
- Already did, sir.
- But I didn't.

40:28.843 --> 40:30.629
Get it out of my sight.

40:30.678 --> 40:32.760
- Carlton, you need to see this.
- What now?

40:32.805 --> 40:34.636
His blood
pressure's back to normal.

40:34.682 --> 40:37.014
Liver functions, too.

40:38.853 --> 40:40.718
I knew it.

40:40.730 --> 40:43.312
See, his body just needed
time to adjust.

40:45.735 --> 40:47.726
I don't want to waste any more time.
I want to up the tests.

40:47.737 --> 40:49.693
- Okay?
- Yeah.

40:51.366 --> 40:53.027
Come on.

40:53.576 --> 40:55.282
You're fired.

40:55.328 --> 40:57.239
Find my symbiote.

40:57.372 --> 40:59.112
Now!

41:19.060 --> 41:20.971
Jesus.

41:41.708 --> 41:44.745
Attention,
passengers for flight 2517

41:44.752 --> 41:47.334
to San Francisco via Hong Kong.

41:47.338 --> 41:51.502
We will be boarding
at gate 9 in 15 minutes.

41:51.551 --> 41:53.507
Please have your
boarding passes...

41:53.553 --> 41:56.010
Suzy.
Come on, over here.

42:04.689 --> 42:06.725
May I speak to Annie weying,
please?

42:06.774 --> 42:08.981
Can you tell her
that it's an emergency?

42:09.027 --> 42:10.938
Food.

42:11.029 --> 42:12.985
Who said that?

42:13.031 --> 42:15.397
No, I'm not talking to you.

42:15.408 --> 42:17.615
Can you please tell me
where she is?

42:18.453 --> 42:21.286
Great. Thank you.

42:25.752 --> 42:27.492
Okay...

42:31.424 --> 42:33.415
Yes, Lana for two?

42:33.426 --> 42:34.791
- I'm sorry, sir?
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:34.802 --> 42:36.087
- Sir?
- Oh, yes.

42:36.095 --> 42:37.489
Oh, my god, Eddie.
What are you doing here?

42:37.513 --> 42:38.719
- Annie...
- No, no, no...

42:38.723 --> 42:40.338
No, I have to tell you
something.

42:40.349 --> 42:42.431
- No, no, no. Please.
- No, now. I have to.

42:42.477 --> 42:43.387
Work told me you were here. You're
the only person that I trust.

42:43.394 --> 42:44.634
Are you drunk?

42:44.687 --> 42:46.290
Yeah. No, I broke into
the life foundation.

42:46.314 --> 42:47.724
- Eddie, you did what?
- Yeah, but I may...

42:47.732 --> 42:49.001
I think I may have been
infected.

42:49.025 --> 42:50.561
He's burning up.
You're really hot.

42:50.568 --> 42:51.432
Eddie, you look like
you're in a bad way.

42:51.486 --> 42:53.477
I am. I am in a bad way.

42:56.491 --> 42:58.231
Eddie, Jesus!

42:58.659 --> 43:00.365
This is dead.

43:00.495 --> 43:01.735
Dead.

43:01.788 --> 43:03.369
Eddie, sit down.

43:03.414 --> 43:05.370
Okay, all right. Okay.

43:05.374 --> 43:06.935
- Hey, hey, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.
- Stop that.

43:06.959 --> 43:08.562
- Sir, sir, sir, I'm so sorry.
- Eddie, quit it.

43:08.586 --> 43:09.666
Put it down. Eddie!

43:09.712 --> 43:12.328
Snap out of it!

43:13.633 --> 43:14.748
No.

43:14.801 --> 43:16.507
All right. It's no good.

43:16.552 --> 43:17.962
Bobby, are you all right?

43:17.970 --> 43:19.301
- Hey!
- Whoa!

43:19.347 --> 43:20.962
Hey, hey, hey.

43:21.015 --> 43:22.596
I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor.

43:23.726 --> 43:25.591
I'm hot.
Is anyone else hot?

43:25.645 --> 43:26.805
Are you hurt?

43:26.854 --> 43:28.060
- Sir, excuse me.
- No! Shh!

43:28.064 --> 43:29.770
Wait,
where are you going? Eddie?

43:29.774 --> 43:31.376
This is unacceptable.
I'm gonna call the police.

43:31.400 --> 43:32.795
What are you doing?
No, please don't.

43:32.819 --> 43:34.355
- No.
- Eddie, please.

43:34.362 --> 43:35.442
Oh, my god.

43:35.488 --> 43:38.321
Ar.

43:42.328 --> 43:43.931
- Now I'm gonna call the police.
- No, no. Please don't call the police.

43:43.955 --> 43:46.016
Here, call an ambulance. I'm a doctor.
This man is my, um...

43:46.040 --> 43:47.701
Patient.

43:47.708 --> 43:49.369
Oh, it's much better.

43:49.377 --> 43:50.742
You are insane.

43:50.795 --> 43:52.285
- He's killing people.
- Who's killing people?

43:52.296 --> 43:53.661
- Carlton Drake.
- Oh, god, Eddie,

43:53.714 --> 43:54.858
- not this again.
- Yes, he is. He is!

43:54.882 --> 43:57.373
And I have proof!

43:57.426 --> 43:59.212
Ugh.

44:04.892 --> 44:08.100
- Hey, Eddie...
- Hmm?

44:12.692 --> 44:14.432
Eddie.

44:15.069 --> 44:17.060
Eddie?

44:17.613 --> 44:19.524
Eddie, can you hear me?

44:20.408 --> 44:22.069
This is Dan speaking to you.

44:22.785 --> 44:25.401
Hey, Dan.

44:25.454 --> 44:26.864
- Welcome back.
- Where am I?

44:26.914 --> 44:28.370
Uh, you're in the mri.

44:28.374 --> 44:29.934
Okay, we've given you
a little sedative.

44:29.959 --> 44:32.666
- Where is Anne?
- Anne is not here right now.

44:32.712 --> 44:34.327
We're gonna run
some tests, okay?

44:34.338 --> 44:35.578
It's gonna be completely
painless.

44:35.590 --> 44:37.421
So, you know,
just try to stay still.

44:37.466 --> 44:39.673
Uh, relax, and, um...

44:40.344 --> 44:41.959
Yeah, here we go.

44:47.602 --> 44:48.933
Eddie, what's happening
in there?

44:48.936 --> 44:51.097
Eddie, you okay?

44:54.817 --> 44:56.523
Shut it down.

44:56.569 --> 44:59.561
Hey, hey, hey.

44:59.614 --> 45:00.774
You're okay. Yeah.

45:00.823 --> 45:02.905
Coming out. You all right?

45:02.950 --> 45:04.531
- Yeah.
- Here, look at me, look at me.

45:04.535 --> 45:06.025
- You okay?
- Yeah.

45:06.037 --> 45:07.973
- All right.
- Just take a deep breath. Okay? You're okay.

45:07.997 --> 45:09.953
Yeah.

45:09.999 --> 45:11.768
Now, listen, you're not the
first person to freak out in there.

45:11.792 --> 45:13.578
I get claustrophobic, too.

45:13.628 --> 45:15.334
Dr. Lewis?

45:15.338 --> 45:17.454
- Oh, boy.
- Hey, Mrs. manfredi. How are you?

45:17.465 --> 45:19.046
Oh, I just saw Morris.

45:19.050 --> 45:22.338
And he's whining and complaining
like an old baby again.

45:22.386 --> 45:24.297
- Oh, good.
- Oh, thank you so much.

45:24.305 --> 45:26.637
Yeah, my pleasure.

45:26.682 --> 45:28.368
Okay, Mrs. manfredi,
we talked about the dog.

45:28.392 --> 45:29.973
Okay, love the dog.
You can't have the dog.

45:29.977 --> 45:32.013
Sorry. Gemini.

45:32.063 --> 45:33.665
We're gonna get to the bottom of this.
All right? That I can promise you.

45:33.689 --> 45:35.099
- But for now, go home, get some rest.
- Uh-huh.

45:35.107 --> 45:36.643
I'll call you when
your tests are in.

45:36.692 --> 45:38.003
- All right, thank you.
- Okay? Yep.

45:38.027 --> 45:39.733
- Thank you, Dan. Thank you.
- You got it.

45:41.739 --> 45:43.104
- Hello, doctor.
- Hi.

45:43.157 --> 45:44.363
Did you have the same reactions

45:44.367 --> 45:46.608
regardless of the temperature...

45:48.955 --> 45:51.241
Good afternoon,
Dr. skirth.

45:55.836 --> 45:57.952
The creature
and the host are one.

45:57.964 --> 45:59.625
Everything was fine.

45:59.632 --> 46:02.214
So, why does the human
continue to waste away?

46:02.260 --> 46:02.294
I don't know. We've given him enough
liquid nutrition to feed an elephant.

46:02.301 --> 46:05.221
I don't know. We've given him enough
liquid nutrition to feed an elephant.

46:05.263 --> 46:05.297
But the organism is unaffected?

46:05.304 --> 46:06.760
But the organism is unaffected?

46:06.764 --> 46:08.129
- The symbiote is thriving.
- Good.

46:08.140 --> 46:10.301
But once again,
it's killing the host.

46:10.351 --> 46:11.966
It's consuming his organs.

46:12.728 --> 46:14.639
Oh, watch this.

46:18.401 --> 46:20.721
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
You're hurting it. Stop it!

46:21.946 --> 46:24.938
Sounds in the 4,000 to 6,000 hertz
range are very harmful for it.

46:24.949 --> 46:27.941
- Well, then don't make those sounds.
- Okay.

46:28.869 --> 46:30.655
He was stabilizing.
What happened?

46:30.663 --> 46:32.403
He's approaching
acute liver failure.

46:32.999 --> 46:34.910
We're gonna need another host.

46:34.917 --> 46:36.908
Such poor design.

46:36.961 --> 46:39.748
- Excuse me?
- Human beings.

46:39.797 --> 46:41.628
Sorry to interrupt.

46:43.801 --> 46:45.632
Thought you'd like
some good news.

46:45.636 --> 46:47.922
I'm sorry.

46:58.065 --> 46:59.601
Hungry!

46:59.650 --> 47:01.811
Oh, goddamn.

47:01.819 --> 47:03.684
I'm okay.
Don't worry about me.

47:03.738 --> 47:05.899
Can I get through, please?
Excuse me.

47:05.906 --> 47:07.191
Thank you.

47:07.199 --> 47:08.735
I'm just gonna stay here,
all right?

47:08.784 --> 47:11.901
Until the cable car stops.

47:16.292 --> 47:18.374
We're good.
All right. Thank you.

47:18.377 --> 47:20.959
Excuse me.

47:25.718 --> 47:26.753
Oh, hey, Anne.

47:26.761 --> 47:29.719
Eddie, hi. How you feeling?

47:29.764 --> 47:29.798
Oh, feeling... I'm sick.

47:29.805 --> 47:31.636
Oh, feeling... I'm sick.

47:31.640 --> 47:34.723
Well, Eddie,
you have a parasite.

47:34.769 --> 47:34.803
They're not exactly sure
how you got it,

47:34.810 --> 47:36.596
they're not exactly sure
how you got it,

47:36.604 --> 47:38.310
but it would explain the fever.

47:38.356 --> 47:39.937
That would make sense.

47:39.940 --> 47:43.808
Also, I'm hearing, uh, a voice.

47:43.819 --> 47:45.714
Auditory hallucinations
are actually very common.

47:45.738 --> 47:47.069
Oh, hey, Dan.
How you doing?

47:47.073 --> 47:48.688
I didn't realize that
you were on the call, too.

47:48.699 --> 47:50.906
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Mmm.

47:50.951 --> 47:52.816
Hey, Dan, would this parasite...

47:52.870 --> 47:54.765
Would it, like, be able to
make me, I don't know...

47:54.789 --> 47:57.906
Like, climb a really, really,
really tall tree,

47:57.917 --> 47:59.908
but super, super fast?

47:59.960 --> 48:01.700
Yes. We just did.

48:01.712 --> 48:03.077
Uh, well, Eddie, it sounds like

48:03.089 --> 48:04.941
it might be causing
some metabolic abnormalities

48:04.965 --> 48:07.110
that are making it hard for your
body to maintain homeostasis.

48:07.134 --> 48:10.001
You said "causing" and "body,"
and... I lost you.

48:10.012 --> 48:11.968
Listen, Eddie, um, we are
gonna get you on some meds,

48:11.972 --> 48:13.303
and we are gonna clear that out.

48:13.307 --> 48:14.843
- Yes.
- Never gonna happen.

48:14.892 --> 48:17.599
Will you stop doing that now.
Not now.

48:17.603 --> 48:19.264
- Eddie, we're just trying to help you.
- I know.

48:19.271 --> 48:21.808
I know. I'm just, I'm not
actually talking to you, Annie.

48:21.816 --> 48:23.272
Who are you talking to?

48:23.275 --> 48:25.140
I'm just gonna call you back,
all right?

48:25.194 --> 48:28.652
Thank you. Thank you, Dan.
Thank you. Thank you, both.

48:43.337 --> 48:44.793
Yeah?

48:44.839 --> 48:46.579
Hey, can you turn
your music down, please?

48:46.632 --> 48:48.338
'Cause I'm having
a really hard time.

48:48.342 --> 48:50.424
Whatever.

48:52.805 --> 48:54.761
Yeah, sure, man. Yeah.

48:54.807 --> 48:57.247
- I'll just turn it right down. Sorry.
- Thank you. Thank you.

48:59.228 --> 49:02.311
I was troubled by

49:02.731 --> 49:04.346
what we've been doing.

49:04.358 --> 49:08.021
I get it.

49:08.696 --> 49:10.106
We've all been troubled.

49:10.114 --> 49:13.277
It's the nature of what we do.

49:14.326 --> 49:17.944
But I need you to tell me
who was here with you.

49:19.081 --> 49:20.946
I need that from you.

49:23.377 --> 49:25.868
I can't do that.

49:25.921 --> 49:29.960
We can't fix things
unless we begin with

49:30.217 --> 49:32.208
your friend.

49:32.970 --> 49:34.676
The person who was here.

49:34.722 --> 49:36.722
Because they're gonna die.
They're in grave danger.

49:37.016 --> 49:39.223
You know that, right?

49:39.268 --> 49:41.725
They're gonna die unless
we bring them back here,

49:41.770 --> 49:41.804
where you can help
to keep them alive.

49:41.812 --> 49:44.599
Where you can help
to keep them alive.

49:47.067 --> 49:49.274
Hey. Dora.

49:50.279 --> 49:53.737
I promise, from here on in,
we will do things differently.

49:56.410 --> 49:58.275
Will you trust me?

50:04.668 --> 50:06.204
Eddie Brock.

50:06.212 --> 50:07.952
- Eddie Brock?
- Mmm-hmm.

50:17.014 --> 50:19.300
You were our best.

50:19.308 --> 50:21.640
Open it.

50:25.189 --> 50:26.349
No! Nol!

50:26.398 --> 50:28.980
No! No! No!

50:33.239 --> 50:35.571
Do not open that door.

50:36.617 --> 50:38.403
Huh?

50:50.297 --> 50:52.333
Stay put.

50:52.341 --> 50:54.582
- Hey, Eddie.
- Who the hell is this guy?

50:54.635 --> 50:57.047
I'm gonna need
Mr. Drake's property back.

50:57.096 --> 50:58.711
Whoa.

50:58.764 --> 51:01.506
- What are you doing?
- I'm, uh...

51:01.517 --> 51:03.178
I'm putting my hands up.

51:03.227 --> 51:05.468
You are making us look bad.

51:05.521 --> 51:08.479
I...
No, I am not.

51:08.482 --> 51:10.018
Yes, you are.

51:10.025 --> 51:11.390
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are!

51:11.402 --> 51:13.108
- No, I'm not.
- Why would you do that?

51:13.112 --> 51:15.103
'Cause it is
a very sensible thing to do.

51:15.114 --> 51:17.275
- Eddie...
- I will take care of this myselr.

51:17.324 --> 51:19.781
- What?
- Eddie, where's the bug?

51:21.036 --> 51:22.401
Take him down.

51:33.173 --> 51:35.164
I'm so sorry about your friends.

51:43.142 --> 51:46.350
- What is that?
- Not "what." Who.

51:47.479 --> 51:49.185
Oh.

51:58.115 --> 51:59.696
Shit.

52:21.013 --> 52:23.345
Outstanding.

52:23.349 --> 52:25.368
Now let's bite all their heads off
and pile them up in the corner.

52:25.392 --> 52:26.472
Why would we do that?

52:26.477 --> 52:29.844
Pile of bodies, pile of heads.

52:36.528 --> 52:38.735
What the shit, man?

52:43.786 --> 52:46.323
No! No, no, no!

52:52.503 --> 52:54.494
- What the hell?
- Dude! How did you do that?

52:54.546 --> 52:57.379
Apparently, I have a parasite.

53:05.474 --> 53:08.011
Mr. Drake, our subject
is carrying the symbiote.

53:08.018 --> 53:10.054
Connecting you to the feed now.

53:14.650 --> 53:16.311
He's achieved symbiosis.

53:16.318 --> 53:17.728
Are you seeing this?

53:17.778 --> 53:20.315
Are you seeing this?
He's achieved symbiosis!

53:21.490 --> 53:22.730
Treece...

53:22.741 --> 53:25.323
Treece, bring me back
my creature.

53:33.210 --> 53:35.041
Eddie.

53:44.138 --> 53:46.470
You're not even here, are you?
I'm just seeing things.

53:46.515 --> 53:46.549
It's not real.
You're in my head.

53:46.557 --> 53:48.548
It's not real.
You're in my head.

53:48.600 --> 53:50.136
'Cause you're just a parasite.

53:50.144 --> 53:51.759
"Parasite"?

53:58.402 --> 54:01.018
You have a brain tumor, Eddie.

54:04.283 --> 54:06.399
I got him. He's in the alley
behind the schueller building.

54:06.410 --> 54:08.196
I am sorry that I
called you a parasite.

54:08.245 --> 54:10.611
We can discuss this
like two men.

54:10.622 --> 54:12.704
What is that? What is that?

54:20.549 --> 54:22.585
What?

54:22.634 --> 54:25.091
Do not let him get away.
Do you understand me, treece?

54:25.095 --> 54:27.586
Copy.
Weapons are armed and ready.

54:27.639 --> 54:29.300
Launch the drones.

54:58.045 --> 55:00.787
Duck.

55:01.590 --> 55:03.171
Whew!

55:03.217 --> 55:05.674
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

55:11.141 --> 55:13.883
Oh!

55:21.443 --> 55:24.355
This is beyond
anything we thought was possible.

55:30.619 --> 55:32.951
Oh, god, no!

55:54.560 --> 55:56.926
Holy shit!

56:03.610 --> 56:05.601
Treece, do not let him get away.

56:05.612 --> 56:08.695
I've got him.
All ground vehicles, move in.

56:14.204 --> 56:16.911
Target is now eastbound
on Grant.

56:17.624 --> 56:19.706
Oh, god! Do something!

56:26.675 --> 56:28.256
What the...

56:34.349 --> 56:37.216
Oh, yeah! We got more friends.
Awesome.

56:40.814 --> 56:42.395
No, no, no! No, no!

56:45.152 --> 56:46.767
No! You're out of your mind!

56:48.238 --> 56:51.150
No!

57:10.385 --> 57:12.922
- That is a dead-end!
- Not for us.

57:14.056 --> 57:16.763
Whoa!

57:22.356 --> 57:23.937
Yeah!

57:53.261 --> 57:55.001
Whoa!

58:01.269 --> 58:02.679
I am going to die!

58:02.688 --> 58:04.724
You are not going to die!

58:16.201 --> 58:19.068
Whoa! That was pretty cool,
actually. I'm not gonna lie...

58:28.046 --> 58:29.286
I got him.

58:29.297 --> 58:30.358
- Bring him home.
- Copy that.

58:30.382 --> 58:32.873
This is incredible.

58:38.598 --> 58:41.465
You have been a serious
pain in the ass for me, Eddie.

58:41.518 --> 58:45.102
Well, you know, I aim to please.

58:56.324 --> 59:00.283
Eyes, lungs, pancreas.

59:00.328 --> 59:03.320
So many snacks, so little time.

59:13.425 --> 59:15.290
Sfpd. Don't move!

59:15.343 --> 59:17.083
Get off the car!

59:33.278 --> 59:34.893
My legs.

59:36.573 --> 59:38.404
Oh, my god, my legs were broken.

59:38.450 --> 59:41.408
Now they're not broken.
What is happening?

59:56.176 --> 59:58.087
What the hell are you?

59:58.095 --> 01:00:00.552
I am venom.

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:03.304
And you are mine.

01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:05.682
You bit somebody's head off.

01:00:05.727 --> 01:00:07.763
Fuel in the tank.

01:00:07.771 --> 01:00:10.012
Listen carefully, Eddie.

01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:12.264
You did not find us.

01:00:12.275 --> 01:00:15.062
We found you.

01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:17.061
Think of yourself as my ride.

01:00:17.114 --> 01:00:18.354
Where are you going?

01:00:18.365 --> 01:00:21.448
We need Carlton Drake's rocket.

01:00:21.493 --> 01:00:23.404
You remember him.

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:24.818
How do you even know about that?

01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:27.321
- I know everything, Eddie.
- You do?

01:00:27.332 --> 01:00:29.163
- Everything about you.
- How?

01:00:29.167 --> 01:00:31.579
I am inside your head.

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:34.745
You are a loser, Eddie.

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.467
Are you gonna eat anybody else?

01:00:41.513 --> 01:00:42.798
Most likely.

01:00:42.806 --> 01:00:44.262
Oh, god.

01:00:44.266 --> 01:00:47.258
That is why we are here.

01:00:47.269 --> 01:00:51.137
Cooperate,
and you might just survive.

01:00:51.731 --> 01:00:54.393
That is the deal.

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:58.673
Good
evening, ladies and gentlemen.

01:00:58.697 --> 01:01:00.562
Welcome to San Francisco.

01:01:00.574 --> 01:01:03.065
For your safety and comfort,
please remain seated...

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:25.253
Hey, babe. I'm almost home.

01:01:25.265 --> 01:01:27.096
- Where's Eddie?
- Why? What's happening?

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:29.762
I got Eddie's labs back,

01:01:30.562 --> 01:01:32.473
and it's worse than I thought.

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:35.639
His systems, renal, endocrine,
they're behaving abnormally.

01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:37.398
I've never seen
anything like it.

01:01:37.402 --> 01:01:39.188
What does that mean, Dan?
What are you telling me?

01:01:39.196 --> 01:01:41.437
- You need to get him here.
- My god.

01:01:44.826 --> 01:01:47.192
- Eddie Brock here. Leave a message.
- Shit.

01:01:53.168 --> 01:01:56.501
Where were you when
it left Dr. skirth's body?

01:01:56.504 --> 01:01:58.665
- Where was he?
- I was...

01:01:58.673 --> 01:02:03.258
This is the higher life-form. You
stood by and watched while it died.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.335
The arrogance.

01:02:10.477 --> 01:02:14.686
Treece, listen to me. After this,
we can't risk killing Brock,

01:02:14.689 --> 01:02:17.055
not until we find
another suitable host.

01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:22.061
I don't want to see you again
unless you have Brock!

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:28.946
Officer, what's happening?
I need to get in there.

01:02:28.995 --> 01:02:31.057
- It's my friend's apartment.
- Building's been evacuated.

01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:32.141
It's not safe for you
to be here, ma'am.

01:02:32.165 --> 01:02:34.030
Found another one, bill.

01:02:34.084 --> 01:02:35.949
Get off the streets.
Go home.

01:02:35.961 --> 01:02:37.667
There's bodies
all over the city tonight.

01:02:37.671 --> 01:02:39.286
Bodies?

01:02:40.131 --> 01:02:42.713
My god, Eddie, where are you?

01:02:45.095 --> 01:02:47.051
Who is Anne?
Your pulse has quickened.

01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:48.962
That is none of your
goddamn business.

01:02:49.015 --> 01:02:51.552
Everything of yours
is my business, Eddie.

01:02:51.559 --> 01:02:53.140
We have no secrets.

01:02:53.144 --> 01:02:54.759
Yeah? Well, then you know
exactly why I'm going here

01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:56.261
before we get to your rocket,
huh?

01:02:56.273 --> 01:02:59.765
Sure.
I'm not unreasonable.

01:02:59.818 --> 01:03:01.558
Shit. Yeah?

01:03:01.611 --> 01:03:03.567
Eddie. Thank god. Where are you?
I need to see you.

01:03:03.571 --> 01:03:05.277
No, no, you can't see me.

01:03:05.323 --> 01:03:07.593
Eddie, I need you to tell me where you are.
I'm coming to get you.

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:09.153
No, you cannot come
anywhere near me.

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:11.742
You cannot come
near me right now.

01:03:11.746 --> 01:03:11.780
- Richard. Hey, Richard...
- No!

01:03:11.788 --> 01:03:13.528
- Richard. Hey, Richard...
- No!

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:15.030
- Eddie?
- No, I gotta go up there.

01:03:15.041 --> 01:03:16.060
You know you're not
supposed to be here, Eddie.

01:03:16.084 --> 01:03:17.540
I got to get up there, man.

01:03:17.585 --> 01:03:19.621
Look, I got love for you, bro,
but no can do.

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:20.994
There's no such thing as can't.

01:03:21.006 --> 01:03:22.746
I'm sorry, man.

01:03:23.091 --> 01:03:25.582
Okay, okay... uh...

01:03:25.593 --> 01:03:27.879
Can you, uh, just give him this?

01:03:27.929 --> 01:03:30.841
- He needs to see what's on it.
- Eddie, please. I really need this job.

01:03:30.849 --> 01:03:33.135
- Let's eat his brains.
- No! You do not touch him!

01:03:33.143 --> 01:03:35.134
- He is my friend.
- What's wrong with you?

01:03:35.145 --> 01:03:37.206
He works three jobs just so
that he can support his family.

01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:38.686
- Eddie, what's going on?
- We're leaving.

01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:40.226
- "We"?
- Yeah.

01:03:40.233 --> 01:03:40.267
- What are you talking about, "we"?
- Just stay back!

01:03:40.275 --> 01:03:42.391
- What are you talking about, "we"?
- Just stay back!

01:03:44.029 --> 01:03:46.441
Yeah.

01:03:51.703 --> 01:03:54.740
- Shit.
- You want up?

01:03:57.917 --> 01:04:00.829
Well, why didn't you just say?

01:04:11.056 --> 01:04:13.547
Hmm.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:16.763
- It is peaceful up here.
- I'm not very good with heights.

01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:20.934
Your world is not so ugly
after all.

01:04:20.982 --> 01:04:23.519
I'm almost sorry to see it end.

01:04:23.568 --> 01:04:25.308
What does that mean?

01:04:32.994 --> 01:04:35.235
Where'd you go?
Where did you go?

01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:46.955
I got us.

01:04:46.966 --> 01:04:48.672
Whoa.

01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:57.094
Again?
You're gonna get me killed.

01:04:57.102 --> 01:04:59.218
You die, I die.

01:04:59.270 --> 01:04:59.304
Yeah, well, you can always
just shed my carcass

01:04:59.312 --> 01:05:01.644
yeah, well, you can always
just shed my carcass

01:05:01.648 --> 01:05:04.105
and exchange it for another
one whenever you need.

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:06.015
Why would I do that?

01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:09.027
You are far too good of a
match to throw away so soon.

01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:11.191
Plus, I am starting to like you.

01:05:11.241 --> 01:05:13.232
You and 1 are not so different.

01:05:13.284 --> 01:05:14.899
Thank you.

01:05:18.206 --> 01:05:19.821
Okay.

01:05:21.209 --> 01:05:23.291
Here's your evidence.

01:05:26.631 --> 01:05:28.417
Jump.

01:05:30.635 --> 01:05:32.591
Pussy.

01:05:42.105 --> 01:05:43.811
Hands!

01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:47.523
On the ground! Now!

01:05:51.322 --> 01:05:54.109
Guys, you do not want to do this.
Trust me.

01:05:54.159 --> 01:05:56.195
- Mask!
- Copy!

01:05:56.202 --> 01:05:58.693
All right, have it your own way.

01:05:58.705 --> 01:06:00.570
- Mask!
- Copy.

01:06:00.582 --> 01:06:02.698
What the hell is that thing?

01:06:07.714 --> 01:06:09.454
What the hell?

01:06:10.133 --> 01:06:11.714
Hold your fire!

01:06:11.718 --> 01:06:13.834
Flares!

01:06:13.845 --> 01:06:14.925
He's there!
He's there!

01:06:14.929 --> 01:06:16.715
Reload!

01:06:17.265 --> 01:06:19.551
Anybody see him?

01:06:29.903 --> 01:06:32.394
Does anyone have eyes on him?

01:06:33.531 --> 01:06:36.238
Switching to
thermal. Seeking target.

01:06:49.255 --> 01:06:51.541
I don't have eyes on him.

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:54.336
Where is it?

01:07:00.767 --> 01:07:02.428
Flash grenade!

01:07:03.102 --> 01:07:04.217
Throw them!

01:07:04.270 --> 01:07:06.352
Flash grenade!

01:07:16.824 --> 01:07:18.064
He's in the rafters!

01:07:18.076 --> 01:07:19.737
Above!

01:07:24.582 --> 01:07:26.197
There he is!

01:07:30.255 --> 01:07:32.291
Move, move, move!

01:08:01.619 --> 01:08:03.905
No! We do not
eat policemen!

01:08:09.711 --> 01:08:11.167
Annie! Annie, wait!

01:08:11.170 --> 01:08:13.001
- Wait, please.
- Oh, what the hell is that?

01:08:13.006 --> 01:08:15.668
That's not me.
I've been infected.

01:08:15.675 --> 01:08:18.131
- Eddie, what's happening?
- He's inside me.

01:08:18.176 --> 01:08:19.712
- "He"?
- Yes.

01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:22.174
- I know it sounds crazy, but...
- You're sick.

01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:25.469
- Eddie, you're really sick.
- No, I am scared!

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:30.511
- And I need help.
- Hospital.

01:08:33.734 --> 01:08:35.316
Right now.

01:08:38.531 --> 01:08:41.273
I can't go with you.
It's not safe.

01:08:41.326 --> 01:08:42.941
Get in the car, Eddie.

01:08:44.495 --> 01:08:48.113
- In the back.
- I like her. Get in.

01:08:54.631 --> 01:08:57.292
I'm out of control.

01:08:58.384 --> 01:08:59.874
Dan just needs to do
another mri.

01:08:59.886 --> 01:09:02.298
- No mri.
- No. No. No mri.

01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:04.136
What? Why?

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.846
Sound at 4,000
to 6,000 hertz is lethal.

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:11.553
Sound frequency in the mri
is really harmful for him.

01:09:11.606 --> 01:09:14.348
What, so, sound
is like his kryptonite?

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:17.142
- Not all sounds.
- And fire.

01:09:17.194 --> 01:09:20.813
Fire. And fire.
He's talking to you?

01:09:21.823 --> 01:09:23.814
Always.

01:09:24.368 --> 01:09:26.484
- Are you in pain?
- No.

01:09:26.537 --> 01:09:29.198
No, I don't feel anything,
actually, apart from...

01:09:29.247 --> 01:09:31.488
I'm hungry all the time.

01:09:31.542 --> 01:09:35.410
And you feel sad, do you
not, Eddie, when you are with her?

01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:37.832
Get out of my head, man.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:40.296
You never apologized.

01:09:40.343 --> 01:09:43.506
You might not live
to get another chance.

01:09:48.810 --> 01:09:50.595
Annie.

01:09:50.645 --> 01:09:54.263
I just want to say
that whatever happens,

01:09:54.273 --> 01:10:00.269
that I am truly sorry for whatever...
And everything I have ever done to you.

01:10:00.279 --> 01:10:02.440
I am truly, truly sorry.

01:10:03.282 --> 01:10:05.898
And that I love you.

01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:08.526
Oh, Eddie...

01:10:08.579 --> 01:10:11.616
Now's really not the time. Let's
just keep you alive, okay?

01:10:11.666 --> 01:10:14.874
Aw, that's nice.

01:10:17.505 --> 01:10:22.374
You know, I'm really wet and
cold. Can I, uh, wear this?

01:10:22.385 --> 01:10:25.548
Yeah, yeah, you can wear
whatever you want.

01:10:25.596 --> 01:10:27.257
Thank you.

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:46.856
Hello?

01:10:57.503 --> 01:10:59.414
What are you doing here?

01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:04.086
Are you lost?

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:08.257
I'm not lost.

01:11:15.271 --> 01:11:16.727
Thanks for coming in.

01:11:16.773 --> 01:11:20.231
- Eddie, I'm sorry.
- What?

01:11:20.276 --> 01:11:23.143
Eddie, I got your labs back, and
your heart has atrophied severely.

01:11:23.154 --> 01:11:25.645
Do not listen to him.
I can fix it

01:11:25.656 --> 01:11:27.192
I don't want you to fix it.

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:29.111
I can heal you.

01:11:30.745 --> 01:11:32.406
Can you fix it?

01:11:32.413 --> 01:11:34.324
No. I've never seen
anything like this before.

01:11:34.373 --> 01:11:36.534
- This parasite, whatever this is...
- "Parasite?"

01:11:36.542 --> 01:11:37.827
It's eating you from the inside.

01:11:37.877 --> 01:11:39.458
Not a parasite.
He's not.

01:11:39.504 --> 01:11:39.538
- You're using him up.
- No. She is wrong.

01:11:39.545 --> 01:11:41.581
- You're using him up.
- No. She is wrong.

01:11:41.589 --> 01:11:44.581
- We need to get you to the icu.
- Wait. Shh!

01:11:44.634 --> 01:11:47.216
- I, Eddie, am I dying?
- No!

01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:48.801
You're killing him.

01:11:48.846 --> 01:11:50.282
They do not know
what they are talking about.

01:11:50.306 --> 01:11:51.842
Listen,
we don't have a lot of time...

01:11:51.849 --> 01:11:53.965
- Oh, god!
- We have to get out of here.

01:11:54.727 --> 01:11:55.788
- Stop!
- Oh, god, he's killing you.

01:11:55.812 --> 01:11:57.518
I'm killing you.
I'm so sorry.

01:11:59.482 --> 01:12:03.066
No! Don't do that!

01:12:17.667 --> 01:12:20.659
Are you all right? Eddie, I'm sorry.
I had to get him out of you.

01:12:20.711 --> 01:12:22.542
What is that?

01:12:28.928 --> 01:12:31.886
You were killing me?

01:12:31.889 --> 01:12:35.552
What happened to "we," man?
What happened to "we"?

01:12:36.811 --> 01:12:42.056
Yeah, look at you now, huh?
Now you're dying, too.

01:12:42.692 --> 01:12:44.398
We're done.

01:12:46.195 --> 01:12:48.549
- Where do you think you're going?
- Anywhere other than here.

01:12:48.573 --> 01:12:50.313
You don't think we have
a little problem on our hands?

01:12:50.324 --> 01:12:52.906
Wait, you're not gonna
leave me here with this thing.

01:12:55.288 --> 01:12:56.778
You want to tell me
what the hell's going on?

01:12:56.789 --> 01:13:00.657
I do. And you're right.
We do need to talk about it,

01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:02.917
but I don't know
much more than you do.

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:05.878
I guess he had
no one else to turn to.

01:13:05.882 --> 01:13:09.591
He's a very complicated man.
But, Dan, I promise,

01:13:09.635 --> 01:13:11.363
there's nothing going on
between me and Eddie.

01:13:11.387 --> 01:13:13.469
I'm not talking
about you and Eddie, Anne.

01:13:13.514 --> 01:13:13.548
- Oh.
- I'm talking about that.

01:13:13.556 --> 01:13:15.342
- Oh.
- I'm talking about that.

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:20.142
Dan.

01:13:26.402 --> 01:13:28.188
Where is it?

01:13:53.554 --> 01:13:56.136
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

01:14:21.624 --> 01:14:25.287
You can kill me,
'cause I'm dying anyway.

01:14:25.336 --> 01:14:29.921
I'm not just gonna kill you.
That wouldn't be any fun.

01:14:29.924 --> 01:14:34.167
No, no, no. I'm gonna rip your
tongue out of your face.

01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:37.087
Whoo!

01:14:38.182 --> 01:14:42.425
Stop. You're bleeding
all over my lab. Go. Go!

01:14:51.404 --> 01:14:53.440
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:56.481
And you know what? Even if I
did, I wouldn't tell you anyway.

01:14:56.492 --> 01:14:56.526
I don't trust you,
and you're insane.

01:14:56.534 --> 01:15:00.368
I don't trust you,
and you're insane.

01:15:00.413 --> 01:15:02.324
- That hurts.
- Sorry.

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:03.787
Long journal entry
about that tonight.

01:15:03.791 --> 01:15:05.531
You're being dumb, Brock.
I'm not insane.

01:15:05.584 --> 01:15:08.701
What's insane is the way
humans choose to live today.

01:15:08.754 --> 01:15:11.291
Think about it.
All we do is take, take, take.

01:15:11.298 --> 01:15:12.708
It can't go on.

01:15:12.758 --> 01:15:15.249
We've brought the planet
to the brink of extinction.

01:15:15.261 --> 01:15:17.252
We're parasites.
You're a good example.

01:15:17.263 --> 01:15:19.128
Think about it.
All you do is take.

01:15:22.852 --> 01:15:25.218
- Trying to get something done.
- Who?

01:15:26.605 --> 01:15:28.846
Didn't you take from the
person you loved the most,

01:15:28.858 --> 01:15:31.349
who trusted you the most?
That's insane.

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:35.854
What I've initiated is a whole
new world, a new species.

01:15:35.865 --> 01:15:38.277
Man and symbiote combined.

01:15:38.284 --> 01:15:40.866
Let me tell you something, buddy.
All right? Just man-to-man.

01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:43.907
Because I have spent a significant
amount of time, all right,

01:15:43.956 --> 01:15:47.323
with one of these creatures
up my ass.

01:15:47.334 --> 01:15:48.619
It's not a lot of fun.

01:15:48.627 --> 01:15:51.209
And then I find out, all along,

01:15:51.255 --> 01:15:52.620
that they're killing you.

01:15:52.631 --> 01:15:54.337
This is the last time
I'm asking you.

01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:56.874
- Where is my symbiote?
- It have no idea.

01:15:56.927 --> 01:15:59.418
- Where is he?
- Oh, my god!

01:15:59.430 --> 01:16:01.136
Where's venom?

01:16:01.182 --> 01:16:05.300
That is the ugliest-looking
thing I have ever seen.

01:16:10.816 --> 01:16:14.559
You know, Brock,
I have no use for you.

01:16:14.612 --> 01:16:17.228
Treece! Come and clean up
your mess.

01:16:17.281 --> 01:16:22.071
Whoa, he has one
up his ass, too.

01:16:29.752 --> 01:16:35.122
Your friends, the others, I apologize.
I tried to keep them alive.

01:16:35.174 --> 01:16:38.541
There are more of us.
Millions more.

01:16:38.552 --> 01:16:41.339
They will follow
wherever I lead.

01:16:42.807 --> 01:16:44.547
Where we lead.

01:16:44.558 --> 01:16:46.264
Yes,"
, we."

01:16:46.310 --> 01:16:50.144
But first,
we must retrieve them.

01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:53.101
I can take care of that.

01:16:57.530 --> 01:17:00.522
Yeah, what you gonna do,
you gonna walk me to death?

01:17:00.533 --> 01:17:02.114
Shut up.

01:17:05.371 --> 01:17:07.532
Not so tough
without your friend.

01:17:12.670 --> 01:17:14.911
Did your mama not love you?

01:17:17.258 --> 01:17:19.294
God damn it!

01:17:20.553 --> 01:17:23.716
I guess it
pays to be a specialist, huh?

01:17:23.722 --> 01:17:25.713
You know, it doesn't matter
if you kill me anyway,

01:17:25.724 --> 01:17:27.464
because there's something
way bigger afoot

01:17:27.518 --> 01:17:29.133
in this world than you and me.

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:31.727
Much bigger than me.

01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:36.815
And it's much,
much bigger than you.

01:17:38.612 --> 01:17:40.398
Karma's a bitch.

01:17:40.447 --> 01:17:42.233
I don't believe in Karma.

01:17:43.409 --> 01:17:45.991
Oh! Ooh!

01:17:50.124 --> 01:17:51.159
Hi, Eddie.

01:17:51.167 --> 01:17:53.158
Whoa. Whoa...

01:17:53.210 --> 01:17:55.997
Oh...

01:17:56.046 --> 01:17:57.627
Mmm...

01:17:58.090 --> 01:17:59.830
Mmm!

01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:17.264
Oh, no.

01:18:18.277 --> 01:18:20.643
I just bit that guy's head off.

01:18:20.696 --> 01:18:23.153
I know, I know. I've been there, too.
It's not fun.

01:18:23.199 --> 01:18:25.986
- The one with Drake is riot.
- Who's riot?

01:18:25.993 --> 01:18:28.484
Riot is what you would call
a team leader.

01:18:28.495 --> 01:18:30.531
He has an arsenal of weapons.

01:18:30.581 --> 01:18:32.993
- Drake's got his own symbiote.
- He is unstoppable.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.536
- Oh, great.
- We have got to go!

01:18:34.585 --> 01:18:36.246
Go where? Where we going?

01:18:36.295 --> 01:18:37.660
- Well, I'm coming with you.
- No!

01:18:37.713 --> 01:18:39.578
It's going to get ugly.

01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:42.297
- Well, she can fight ugly. Trust me.
- Yeah, I can fight ugly.

01:18:43.469 --> 01:18:45.630
Not today.

01:18:46.513 --> 01:18:48.674
Oh, that's bullshit!

01:18:50.267 --> 01:18:51.973
This is not a simulation.

01:18:52.019 --> 01:18:54.135
Well, the flight team
aren't prepped yet.

01:18:54.188 --> 01:18:56.600
I'll be piloting the spacecraft.

01:18:56.607 --> 01:18:58.313
- You?
- Yes, me.

01:18:58.359 --> 01:19:00.020
How long?

01:19:00.027 --> 01:19:01.733
We're loading the probe
and running diagnostics.

01:19:01.737 --> 01:19:05.696
But even fully automated, you
can't pilot that craft all alone.

01:19:07.368 --> 01:19:09.029
I'm not alone.

01:19:12.081 --> 01:19:15.369
God damn it! What the hell
happened there? We just left Annie.

01:19:15.376 --> 01:19:17.332
It 7s not safe for her.

01:19:17.336 --> 01:19:18.951
If we do not stop riot,

01:19:18.963 --> 01:19:22.330
he will come back here
with millions more of my kind.

01:19:22.383 --> 01:19:26.717
Millions? What, you were
gonna take the rocket,

01:19:26.762 --> 01:19:26.796
and you were gonna come back
here with an invasion force?

01:19:26.804 --> 01:19:28.990
And you were gonna come back
here with an invasion force?

01:19:29.014 --> 01:19:30.700
Then what were you gonna do,
you were gonna go feed

01:19:30.724 --> 01:19:32.464
- on a whole planet?
- Yes/

01:19:32.476 --> 01:19:34.637
but itis different now, Eddie.

01:19:34.687 --> 01:19:37.224
- I have decided to stay.
- Wow!

01:19:37.231 --> 01:19:37.265
On my planet, I am
kind of a loser, like you.

01:19:37.273 --> 01:19:40.265
On my planet, I am
kind of a loser, like you.

01:19:40.276 --> 01:19:42.983
- But here, we could be more.
- Excuse me?

01:19:43.028 --> 01:19:44.734
And I'm getting to like it here.

01:19:44.738 --> 01:19:44.772
Oh, you like us now,
do you, huh?

01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:47.396
Oh, you like us now,
do you, huh?

01:19:47.408 --> 01:19:50.024
However, there will be nothing left to
like if we do not stop that rocket.

01:19:50.035 --> 01:19:54.028
Oh, I see. Right. When it comes
to being completely annihilated,

01:19:54.039 --> 01:19:56.121
- then it's back to "we."
- It/s "we."

01:19:56.166 --> 01:19:58.532
Like it or not, it is
going to take both of us.

01:19:58.544 --> 01:20:00.205
Hey, come on, man.
Cut the bullshit.

01:20:00.254 --> 01:20:00.288
What really made you
change your mind?

01:20:00.296 --> 01:20:02.287
What really made you
change your mind?

01:20:05.509 --> 01:20:09.047
You. You did, Eddie.

01:20:10.472 --> 01:20:13.134
Scrub diagnostics.

01:20:13.142 --> 01:20:16.100
- Sir?
- Did you hear me? Initiate the launch.

01:20:22.192 --> 01:20:25.275
I-minus
fflve minutes to launch.

01:20:25.279 --> 01:20:25.313
I-minus
fflve minutes to launch.

01:20:25.321 --> 01:20:28.188
Auto sequence has been
initiated.

01:20:40.294 --> 01:20:42.250
Oh, shit.

01:20:51.263 --> 01:20:54.755
I-minus
four minutes, 30 seconds.

01:21:01.648 --> 01:21:05.391
Oh, Jesus!
You can take this guy, right?

01:21:05.402 --> 01:21:08.064
He has got shit
you have never seen.

01:21:08.113 --> 01:21:10.195
What does that mean?
What are our chances?

01:21:10.199 --> 01:21:13.612
Hmm. Pretty much zero.

01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:17.118
Oh, fuck it. Well,
let's go save the planet.

01:21:19.541 --> 01:21:22.248
T-minus four minutes.

01:21:25.339 --> 01:21:28.752
Initiate orbiter
aerosurface profile.

01:21:31.428 --> 01:21:34.215
Venom. Get in the rocket.

01:21:34.264 --> 01:21:34.298
No. We won't let you destroy
this world.

01:21:34.306 --> 01:21:38.345
No. We won't let you destroy
this world.

01:21:38.394 --> 01:21:40.305
Then die.

01:21:50.447 --> 01:21:52.438
I a tn ra ee

01:21:52.449 --> 01:21:54.656
t-minus three minutes.

01:22:06.505 --> 01:22:08.621
You have a strong host.

01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:12.211
But not strong enough.

01:22:50.382 --> 01:22:53.715
I-minus
two minutes, 30 seconds.

01:22:55.304 --> 01:22:57.010
Eddie.

01:23:00.976 --> 01:23:02.932
Drake, stop!

01:24:08.544 --> 01:24:11.581
Told you I could fight ugly.

01:24:18.136 --> 01:24:21.048
T-mi/inus one minute.

01:24:38.407 --> 01:24:40.113
You're too late.

01:24:40.117 --> 01:24:41.698
This is the next stage...

01:24:43.787 --> 01:24:46.574
You talk too much.

01:24:55.632 --> 01:24:57.543
T-minus 30 seconds.

01:24:57.593 --> 01:24:59.800
You are nothing.

01:25:27.873 --> 01:25:29.738
Ten seconds.

01:25:29.916 --> 01:25:31.622
Nine...

01:25:31.877 --> 01:25:33.538
Eight...

01:25:33.879 --> 01:25:35.460
Seven...

01:25:35.672 --> 01:25:37.162
Six...

01:25:37.174 --> 01:25:38.789
Five...

01:25:39.009 --> 01:25:40.624
Four...

01:25:40.677 --> 01:25:42.167
Three...

01:25:42.179 --> 01:25:44.044
Two...

01:25:44.056 --> 01:25:46.638
One...

01:25:47.851 --> 01:25:49.591
Liftoff.

01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:57.975
Traitor!

01:25:57.986 --> 01:26:00.318
Have a nice life.

01:26:26.014 --> 01:26:27.970
Goodbye, Eddie.

01:26:28.642 --> 01:26:30.678
Venom, no!

01:27:29.035 --> 01:27:32.493
Hmm. You're in luck. I've
decided to work pro bono.

01:27:32.539 --> 01:27:34.495
I'm joining
the public defenders' office.

01:27:34.499 --> 01:27:36.455
You're a good person, Annie.

01:27:36.501 --> 01:27:37.979
What about you?
What are you gonna do?

01:27:38.003 --> 01:27:39.814
Uh, the network asked me
to bring the show back,

01:27:39.838 --> 01:27:41.829
and they want to start
with a piece on Drake.

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:43.922
Oh, wow, really?
So, what did you say?

01:27:43.967 --> 01:27:48.381
Uh, I'm not into it. I want to
concentrate on the written word.

01:27:48.388 --> 01:27:50.470
I scored the interview
of a lifetime.

01:27:50.474 --> 01:27:52.806
- Oh, yeah? Who?
- You're gonna have to read it.

01:27:52.809 --> 01:27:55.425
Oh! Like everyone else.

01:27:55.479 --> 01:27:57.015
Yeah.

01:27:58.899 --> 01:28:01.686
Hey, I'm sorry about venom.

01:28:02.819 --> 01:28:04.605
Hey, um...

01:28:06.698 --> 01:28:08.484
Do you want to talk
about that kiss?

01:28:08.533 --> 01:28:12.321
Oh, that? You call that a kiss...
No, that was...

01:28:13.371 --> 01:28:17.080
Uh, that was your buddy's idea.

01:28:17.083 --> 01:28:20.075
Oh, right. Well,
that is good to know.

01:28:22.005 --> 01:28:24.917
- It did feel kind of great, though.
- What?

01:28:25.008 --> 01:28:26.418
I mean, the...

01:28:26.426 --> 01:28:29.918
- The power?
- Yeah. When it's, you know...

01:28:29.971 --> 01:28:31.507
- Inside you?
- You know what I mean.

01:28:31.515 --> 01:28:33.221
Okay.

01:28:33.934 --> 01:28:35.515
- Hey, Eddie?
- Mmm-hmm?>

01:28:35.519 --> 01:28:37.726
we're not gonna
tell Dan about this. Okay?

01:28:37.771 --> 01:28:41.480
Look at her. She has no
idea we are going to get her back.

01:28:41.483 --> 01:28:44.395
No, I don't think so.

01:28:44.444 --> 01:28:46.856
- Sorry, what was that?
- We're not gonna tell Dan.

01:28:46.905 --> 01:28:48.674
Eddie, is there something
you want to tell me?

01:28:48.698 --> 01:28:51.314
- Nope.
- You belong with us, Annie.

01:28:51.326 --> 01:28:52.816
Eddie, are you sure?

01:28:52.869 --> 01:28:54.825
Good lord, look at that.

01:28:54.871 --> 01:28:57.578
- Look at the time.
- I have to go.

01:28:58.750 --> 01:29:00.911
- Hey, it's nice seeing you.
- Yeah.

01:29:00.919 --> 01:29:03.285
You take care, all right?

01:29:03.338 --> 01:29:05.704
- Yeah, you take care of yourself.
- Bye.

01:29:09.052 --> 01:29:12.465
Hey. Don't give up on her.

01:29:12.472 --> 01:29:14.212
Either of you.

01:29:14.391 --> 01:29:15.722
We won't.

01:29:15.767 --> 01:29:17.428
- Who is that guy?
- Okay.

01:29:17.477 --> 01:29:20.014
Wart.
This thing looks delicious.

01:29:20.021 --> 01:29:22.637
I have absolutely no problem
with you sticking around,

01:29:22.691 --> 01:29:25.603
but if you do, we're gonna have to
have some ground rules, all right?

01:29:25.610 --> 01:29:29.353
You cannot just go around eating
anybody that you want to.

01:29:29.406 --> 01:29:31.317
- I cannot?
- No, you cannot.

01:29:31.366 --> 01:29:33.052
All right, we need to...
We need to reiterate this.

01:29:33.076 --> 01:29:36.614
There are good people
in this world, a lot of them.

01:29:36.621 --> 01:29:38.907
And then there are bad people.

01:29:38.915 --> 01:29:40.780
You have to tell the difference.

01:29:40.792 --> 01:29:44.626
The deal is, you will only
ever be allowed to touch,

01:29:44.671 --> 01:29:48.004
harm, hurt, possibly,
very possibly,

01:29:48.049 --> 01:29:50.415
eat very, very bad people,

01:29:50.468 --> 01:29:53.335
but never, ever,
ever good people. All right?

01:29:53.346 --> 01:29:55.712
- Fine.
- Good.

01:29:55.724 --> 01:29:57.464
But how does one
tell the difference?

01:29:57.517 --> 01:29:57.551
Well, it's super simple.

01:29:57.559 --> 01:29:59.550
Well, it's super simple.

01:29:59.603 --> 01:30:02.470
I mean, you just have to... you
can intuit it, you can sense it.

01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:02.514
Sometimes you can even feel it.

01:30:02.522 --> 01:30:04.513
Sometimes you can even feel it.

01:30:04.566 --> 01:30:05.976
Whatever you say.

01:30:05.984 --> 01:30:06.018
But can we get something to
eat now?

01:30:06.026 --> 01:30:08.017
But can we get something to
eat now?

01:30:08.069 --> 01:30:13.439
Otherwise, your liver, it's starting
to look really, really good and juicy.

01:30:13.491 --> 01:30:16.358
Yeah. Definitely.
I know a place down here.

01:30:17.370 --> 01:30:20.237
Hey, Mrs. c.

01:30:20.749 --> 01:30:22.410
How you doing, Eddie?

01:30:22.417 --> 01:30:23.978
Ain't nothing changed
but the weather. You know.

01:30:24.002 --> 01:30:24.036
No.

01:30:24.044 --> 01:30:26.911
No.

01:30:26.963 --> 01:30:30.296
So, what culinary delights will
tickle the pickle tonight?

01:30:30.342 --> 01:30:31.957
Later tots and chocolate.

01:30:32.010 --> 01:30:32.044
Right. Okay, no problem.

01:30:32.052 --> 01:30:34.259
Right. Okay, no problem.

01:30:34.930 --> 01:30:37.091
The payment's due, chen.

01:30:38.016 --> 01:30:39.972
Please.
I can't keep doing this.

01:30:40.018 --> 01:30:40.052
Now.

01:30:40.060 --> 01:30:41.516
Now.

01:30:41.561 --> 01:30:43.677
- Bad guy, right?
- Yep.

01:30:50.654 --> 01:30:52.690
You come in here again...

01:30:52.739 --> 01:30:57.358
In fact, you go anywhere in this
city, preying on innocent people,

01:30:57.410 --> 01:31:00.868
and we will find you
and eat both your arms

01:31:00.914 --> 01:31:02.870
- and then both of your legs.
- No, no.

01:31:02.916 --> 01:31:05.953
And then we will eat your face right
off your head. Do you understand?

01:31:05.961 --> 01:31:07.826
- Please...
- Yes.

01:31:07.879 --> 01:31:11.747
So, you will be this armless,
legless, faceless thing, won't you,

01:31:11.758 --> 01:31:16.502
rolling down the street,
like a turd in the wind?

01:31:16.513 --> 01:31:19.471
- Do you feel me?
- What the hell are you?

01:31:20.809 --> 01:31:23.926
We are venom.

01:31:24.896 --> 01:31:27.558
- On second thought...
- Please.

01:31:34.030 --> 01:31:36.396
Eddie? What was that?

01:31:36.449 --> 01:31:37.814
Oh...

01:31:37.826 --> 01:31:42.195
I have a parasite. Yeah.
Night, Mrs. chen.

01:31:42.956 --> 01:31:44.492
- "Parasite"?
- Yeah.

01:31:44.499 --> 01:31:44.533
It's a term of endearment,
that's all.

01:31:44.541 --> 01:31:46.452
It's a term of endearment,
that's all.

01:31:46.501 --> 01:31:46.535
- Apologize!
- No.

01:31:46.543 --> 01:31:48.454
- Apologize!
- No.

01:31:48.503 --> 01:31:48.537
- Apologize!
- All right, fine.

01:31:48.545 --> 01:31:51.412
- Apologize!
- All right, fine.

01:31:51.423 --> 01:31:54.335
I'm sorry. So, what do you
want to do now?

01:31:54.384 --> 01:31:59.094
The way I see it,
we can do whatever we want.

01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:27.525
I need you to stay quiet.

01:34:27.579 --> 01:34:30.491
This is a "me" thing.
It is not a "we" thing.

01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:34.249
- You got that?
- Fine, but make it quick.

01:34:38.006 --> 01:34:39.542
Open on five.

01:34:39.591 --> 01:34:43.254
Go. Opening up.

01:34:44.762 --> 01:34:47.424
You ask me, they're dumb
to let him call the shots.

01:34:47.473 --> 01:34:49.964
Second he asked
for you to interview him,

01:34:50.018 --> 01:34:51.724
I'd have shut that shit down.

01:34:51.728 --> 01:34:53.889
Oh, yeah, you know the FBI.
They're just taking advantage

01:34:53.897 --> 01:34:56.513
of the one and only time
he'll ever speak to anyone.

01:34:56.524 --> 01:34:59.641
They're hoping that I might help them
identify some additional bodies.

01:34:59.652 --> 01:35:03.315
FBI don't work up close
and personal with him.

01:35:03.323 --> 01:35:07.362
The FBI will have to identify you,
if you don't follow the rules.

01:35:09.871 --> 01:35:13.329
Hey, red!
I got a visitor for you.

01:35:32.894 --> 01:35:35.510
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hey.

01:35:35.521 --> 01:35:39.935
Do you mind if we forego the whole
creepy serial killer thing here?

01:35:39.984 --> 01:35:41.349
Sure, it's good with me.

01:35:41.361 --> 01:35:43.693
I mean, I can turn it on
if you want.

01:35:43.696 --> 01:35:50.534
I can talk about the dadaist
patterns of arterial spray.

01:35:50.578 --> 01:35:52.614
I bet you can.

01:35:52.622 --> 01:35:55.705
Tough to see you
in this light, Eddie.

01:35:55.959 --> 01:35:57.540
Come on over.

01:35:57.961 --> 01:35:59.997
All right.

01:36:04.425 --> 01:36:05.710
I'm here.

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:10.049
When I get out of here,
and I will,

01:36:10.807 --> 01:36:13.344
there's gonna be carnage.
