-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.167 --> 00:36.233
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.267 --> 00:38.800
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:38.833 --> 00:42.000
in a court of law.

00:42.033 --> 00:44.933
-Officer Gentry: My dad
and I have started
getting real serious

00:44.967 --> 00:48.967
into cooking barbecue
and entering into competitions.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.333
He's perfected his ribs
and all that stuff

00:51.367 --> 00:54.567
and I help him prepare it
and mostly sit around

00:54.600 --> 00:56.033
and eat all the good stuff.

00:56.067 --> 00:59.033
I act like I'm working
and get to eat a lot
of good food.

00:59.067 --> 01:01.267
It's a lot of fun
to do that with my dad.

01:01.300 --> 01:03.067
-(police radio chatter)

01:03.067 --> 01:05.467
-We're going to
a domestic violence call.

01:05.500 --> 01:08.500
There's a guy on scene
who's throwing things around.

01:08.533 --> 01:10.233
There's a couple deputies
already there.

01:10.267 --> 01:13.867
They're asking for
another deputy to come 10-18,

01:13.900 --> 01:15.833
so we need to expedite
our response,

01:15.867 --> 01:17.767
get there as safe
as we can.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.533
22595. Where are they at?
I had interference
with the radio.

01:23.567 --> 01:25.267
-Uh...
-Where's he at?

01:25.300 --> 01:28.067
-He's in the back.
He's, like, crazy as hell.
-(people shouting)

01:28.067 --> 01:30.400
-We're begging him to stop.
We don't know.

01:30.433 --> 01:32.233
-(people shouting)

01:32.267 --> 01:34.333
-Officer: Robert, sit down.
-Robert: Why, man?

01:34.367 --> 01:35.633
-Just stay down!

01:35.667 --> 01:37.900
-Rob, take the cactus out
of your hand!

01:37.933 --> 01:39.200
-How can I relax?

01:39.233 --> 01:42.300
Where's Leanne?
She got my blood?

01:42.333 --> 01:44.267
-Relax, Rob.
Come on, big guy.

01:44.300 --> 01:45.533
We're on your side!

01:45.567 --> 01:48.267
-Robert!
-Robert, get your hand
off the wire!

01:48.300 --> 01:52.200
-Ain't no wire to go.
You son-of-a-bitches!
-Robert, I'm on your side.

01:52.233 --> 01:53.800
-I don't give a (bleep).

01:53.833 --> 01:55.867
(bleep) tase me now!
I'm low to ground.

01:55.900 --> 01:58.333
-Look, we're not gonna tase you.
-We're not gonna tase you, Rob.

01:58.367 --> 02:00.367
-You wanna hear the crackle!
-We're not gonna tase you.

02:00.400 --> 02:01.700
-No, (bleep) that!
-Listen to me. Look--

02:01.733 --> 02:03.067
-Drop it, Rob!
-I am a creature.

02:03.100 --> 02:04.467
-Hey, listen.
-(indistinct) that pipe.

02:04.500 --> 02:06.467
-Drop it now!
-Put it down now

02:06.500 --> 02:07.933
or you're gonna get tased!

02:07.967 --> 02:09.633
-Robert!
-No! Calm down, Rob!

02:09.667 --> 02:11.067
-Put it down!
-Drop it, Rob!

02:11.067 --> 02:13.633
-Taser.
-(groans)

02:16.100 --> 02:17.900
-Don't move, Robert!
Put your hands behind your back.

02:17.933 --> 02:20.133
-Turn over!
Turn over, Rob!

02:20.167 --> 02:21.333
Turn over!
-Ow!

02:21.367 --> 02:23.100
-There you go.
Calm down, Rob!

02:23.133 --> 02:24.600
-I've got a wire
on my head.

02:24.633 --> 02:26.133
-Hey, I'm gonna get--
I'm gonna get him again.

02:26.167 --> 02:27.833
-Watch out.
-Robert, you're gonna
get it again.

02:27.867 --> 02:30.500
-Double cuff. Double cuff.
-Stop resisting! Stop resisting!

02:30.533 --> 02:33.533
-(groans)

02:36.167 --> 02:37.767
-Slow everyone down.
We're 10-15.

02:37.800 --> 02:40.167
-10-15.
Rob, calm down.

02:40.200 --> 02:42.333
-You wanna get him up?
-Hey, y'all hit me
with electricity.

02:42.367 --> 02:43.700
-Why are you grabbin'
stuff, man?

02:43.733 --> 02:45.533
-If they ain't hear me by now,
they'll never hear me.

02:45.567 --> 02:47.133
-Hey, guy, man,
I would like your story, man.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.133
You were doing good.
-But we're listening
to you, man.

02:49.167 --> 02:50.700
-Tell me about
your sister, Big Rob.

02:50.733 --> 02:52.333
-We're listening to you.
-She's beautiful.

02:52.367 --> 02:55.067
-She's beautiful?
Yeah, that's awesome.
-Yeah. I one time--

02:55.100 --> 02:57.200
-Where she at?
How old is she, Rob?

02:57.233 --> 02:58.933
-(sobs)
You all think I'm crazy.

02:58.967 --> 03:00.867
-No, no, I'm with you, Rob.
I'm with you.

03:00.900 --> 03:02.867
-I don't want to do that.
-He picked up that cinder block

03:02.900 --> 03:06.933
and started slamming it on
the ground. I told him to put it
down, he didn't, so we're here.

03:06.967 --> 03:09.433
Robert, when I count to three,
we're gonna lift you up, okay?

03:09.467 --> 03:11.067
And you're gonna go
that way, all right?

03:11.100 --> 03:13.167
Straight, Rob.
-Well, hang on,
you ain't gonna let me up.

03:13.200 --> 03:14.700
-Yep, we're gonna
lift you up.
-Help me up.

03:14.733 --> 03:16.967
-We're gonna help
you up. Ready? One--
-Hang on. Watch that cactus.

03:17.067 --> 03:18.733
-We got you, big guy.
-Y'all gonna drop me on it?

03:18.767 --> 03:20.367
-Officers: No.
-You promise?

03:20.400 --> 03:21.800
-Robert, I promise you.
You ready?

03:21.833 --> 03:24.467
-Please don't drop me on it.
-One-- one, two, three.

03:24.500 --> 03:26.267
-There you go, Rob.
Walk straight.
-There you go.

03:26.300 --> 03:28.500
-There you go. See?
We didn't drop you on it.
Come on.

03:28.533 --> 03:30.500
-You got his waistband
in the front?
-Yeah.

03:30.533 --> 03:32.400
Here, let me pull it up.
-Whoa, whoa, stop, Rob.

03:32.433 --> 03:34.400
-Let me just ask him again.

03:34.433 --> 03:37.433
-Hey, I'ma pull
these prongs out, okay?
-I already don't like cops.

03:37.467 --> 03:39.400
All right?
-It's gonna sting
a little bit, all right?

03:39.433 --> 03:42.233
All right, we're done.
-No! Don't take me, officers!

03:42.267 --> 03:44.200
Please don't take me
out of this fence!

03:44.233 --> 03:45.367
-Come on, come on.

03:45.400 --> 03:46.867
-(mumbles)
-Come on.
We're going right there.

03:46.900 --> 03:49.167
-(indistinct) son-of-a-bitch!
-We're going right there.
Come on.

03:49.200 --> 03:51.867
-We're just gonna walk out
and get you checked out
by an ambulance, all right?

03:51.900 --> 03:53.933
-You don't want me
to leave this body.
-No, we don't want...

03:53.967 --> 03:56.100
-I'm just sayin'.
I'm an actor. I'm a poet.

03:56.133 --> 03:57.767
-Yep, and you're
a good rhymer.
-I'm Shakespeare.

03:57.800 --> 04:00.633
You didn't know it. Shakespeare.
-Yeah, and you rap
real good too.

04:00.667 --> 04:02.233
-I shake the air!

04:02.267 --> 04:05.333
D-E-S-pair.
I swear.

04:05.367 --> 04:07.233
Can everybody do
a little better?

04:07.267 --> 04:08.600
Tear off the pairs!

04:08.633 --> 04:10.433
-Yeah, you beat Lil Wayne,
you told me.

04:10.467 --> 04:13.067
-Fire truck's right here.
They're gonna check you out
and check your vitals, okay?

04:13.067 --> 04:15.733
-That's all that I gotta say.
-Hold on. I'll see what
they wanna do with him.

04:15.767 --> 04:18.333
-I've been here for a while.
I ain't going away.
-Put-- Just put--

04:18.367 --> 04:20.433
Stay here with him.
I'm gonna get-- make sure
they're good.

04:20.467 --> 04:22.367
I'm gonna let them know
what's goin' on.
-(bleep) eclipse.

04:22.400 --> 04:25.100
I ain't (bleep) playin'.
I ain't Lil Wayne.

04:25.133 --> 04:27.067
-He's off the chain right now.
Eatin' a cactus.

04:27.067 --> 04:30.267
-A spice thing?
-It could be. It could be spice.
Yeah, absolutely it could be.

04:30.300 --> 04:32.267
We haven't-- I haven't
debriefed the family yet,

04:32.300 --> 04:35.133
so I don't know
what he's taken, and...

04:35.167 --> 04:37.067
but it very well
could be spice.

04:37.067 --> 04:39.633
-Rob, Rob, just relax.
-I'll feel bad for y'all,
I swear, when I go to jail.

04:39.667 --> 04:41.600
-Relax, big guy.
-Robert--

04:41.633 --> 04:43.533
-I ain't real mad.
I'm mad with the quill.

04:43.567 --> 04:46.600
-Hey, Robert, you do
any drugs tonight?
-Yeah. Methamphetamine.

04:46.633 --> 04:48.767
-You smoke it?
-Shot it up. 20.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.167
-All right. Cool.
-But you know what?

04:50.200 --> 04:52.933
-Anything else?
-I tried to drink beer
with my uncle.

04:52.967 --> 04:54.367
I tried to smoke
a bubble with him.

04:54.400 --> 04:56.733
-I wasn't gonna do a needle
and I know he gets on it.
-Yeah?

04:56.767 --> 04:59.500
-And I said, "Let's do it."
I smoked some and he said no.

04:59.533 --> 05:02.233
He wasn't doing it.
And I went in there for spite

05:02.267 --> 05:04.833
'cause he wasn't gonna
smoke with me (bleep) tonight

05:04.867 --> 05:08.067
'cause we always know
that's (indistinct)

05:08.067 --> 05:11.467
K.A.K. mother-(bleep).
I got y'all.

05:11.500 --> 05:12.633
-What the heck happened?

05:12.667 --> 05:14.333
Do a quick run down
on what you all got.

05:14.367 --> 05:17.500
-Uh, when we first arrived
on scene, the uncle met us

05:17.533 --> 05:20.933
at the front door sayin'
his nephew was in the backyard

05:20.967 --> 05:23.367
basically nude
and screaming at stuff.

05:23.400 --> 05:25.800
When we got into the backyard,
he was already dressed.

05:25.833 --> 05:27.367
-(sobbing)
-He started grabbing objects,

05:27.400 --> 05:28.600
wouldn't let us
get close to him,

05:28.633 --> 05:30.133
threw a knife,
threw a machete,

05:30.167 --> 05:31.667
he got a wire
wrapped on his wrists.

05:31.700 --> 05:34.767
I really thought
he was gonna slit his wrists
or choke himself with it,

05:34.800 --> 05:37.833
but as you saw, he started
unwrapping them near the end.
-Right, right.

05:37.867 --> 05:40.367
-That's when he grabbed the pipe
and started swinging.

05:40.400 --> 05:41.667
-Yeah, well, I saw
him grab that,

05:41.700 --> 05:44.233
so I just, you know, deployed
and lucky I got a hit.

05:44.267 --> 05:47.300
-I'm just glad you got here
because one of us wouldn't
take him down by ourself.

05:47.333 --> 05:49.067
-He was--
-Especially with that stick.

05:49.067 --> 05:52.233
-He was not going to get close.
-He was ready to go
when I got here for sure.

05:52.267 --> 05:53.500
-Well, I'm just glad
we got him.

05:53.533 --> 05:54.933
-To be honest with you...
-Yeah?

05:54.967 --> 05:57.500
he's been rapping
for like 30 minutes.
-He's been doing it

05:57.533 --> 06:00.500
since I got here, too.
-Yeah, he's been rapping
and rhymes, and...

06:00.533 --> 06:02.933
just kept sayin' Lil Wayne
ain't got nothin' on him.

06:02.967 --> 06:04.400
That's what he kept sayin'.

06:04.433 --> 06:05.633
-John, what happened tonight?

06:05.667 --> 06:09.167
-(stammering) He just,
he flips out like that, man.

06:09.200 --> 06:10.967
-Well, he told us
he took methamphetamine.

06:11.067 --> 06:12.800
Is that true?
-Well, I don't know
nothin' about that.

06:12.833 --> 06:15.133
-You didn't see him take it?
-No. They was cuttin'
two trees down,

06:15.167 --> 06:17.133
I took my girlfriend over
to where he is--
-Who? He was?

06:17.167 --> 06:18.833
-Yeah. They were cuttin' up
two pines in the front.

06:18.867 --> 06:20.633
Him and three
or four other guys.
-Okay.

06:20.667 --> 06:23.167
-I mean--
-It went from zero
to 60 like that?

06:23.200 --> 06:25.233
-That's how he is.
I mean, that's just how he is.

06:25.267 --> 06:26.567
-What was he in jail
for last time?

06:26.600 --> 06:29.600
-'Cause he went-- he--

06:29.633 --> 06:31.233
Him and his sister.
-Okay.

06:31.267 --> 06:33.633
-You know what I'm sayin'?
I mean, I wasn't there
for all of it...

06:33.667 --> 06:35.500
-Okay.
-but that's what
it boils down to.

06:35.533 --> 06:38.433
You know, he gets like this,
but I mean, he-- he...

06:38.467 --> 06:40.900
he's a teddy bear,
but I mean, he just gets--

06:40.933 --> 06:42.967
he-- he--
he needs meds, man.

06:43.067 --> 06:45.133
-Is he diagnosed with anything?
Is he prescribed anything?

06:45.167 --> 06:47.067
-I don't think so, man.
I mean, I tried last time

06:47.100 --> 06:49.167
when they come
out here and got him.
He was just like that.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.700
I said,
"He won't need
to go to jail.

06:50.733 --> 06:52.233
He needs to be diagnosed."
-Okay.

06:52.267 --> 06:53.600
He needs to be sent
to Grace Point.

06:53.633 --> 06:55.867
I know all of 'em
'cause I got a girlfriend.

06:55.900 --> 06:57.900
-He's got cuts all over him.
Where did those come from?

06:57.933 --> 07:00.467
-Just out in the yard
beatin' on-- beatin' on (bleep)

07:00.500 --> 07:03.167
But he's a good man.
He just needs help, guys.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.733
-Okay. Well, we're gonna
get him some help, then.
-I mean, for real.

07:05.767 --> 07:07.733
-We are. We're not gonna
arrest him tonight.

07:07.767 --> 07:10.667
We're gonna take him
to the hospital to get him
the help he needs.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.067
-Corporal Shanks: So being
from California,

07:15.100 --> 07:16.800
at least where I grew up,
we're not big on barbecue,

07:16.833 --> 07:20.067
and coming to Lubbock, Texas,
everybody's into barbecue

07:20.067 --> 07:21.500
and I just can't get
enough of it.

07:21.533 --> 07:23.900
What I cook the most
has gotta be brisket.

07:23.933 --> 07:25.800
That's number one.
That's my favorite thing now.

07:25.833 --> 07:28.700
And I even went out
and bought, you know,
a nice smoker

07:28.733 --> 07:31.700
so I can do that myself
'cause that's-- I love it.

07:31.733 --> 07:34.400
I could eat it all day
if I could.

07:34.433 --> 07:35.933
I'm gonna do a traffic stop
on this vehicle

07:35.967 --> 07:38.067
for a traffic violation.

07:41.767 --> 07:47.067
-(police radio chatter)

07:47.100 --> 07:50.333
-31-81, traffic.
Stay in the vehicle.

07:50.367 --> 07:51.967
-Huh?
-Stay in the vehicle.

07:52.067 --> 07:53.167
-(door squeaks)

07:53.200 --> 07:54.933
-Go in the vehicle.

07:54.967 --> 07:56.267
No, stay in it.

07:56.300 --> 07:57.500
-Okay.

07:57.533 --> 07:59.600
-Roll down your window.

08:01.667 --> 08:03.667
Where you heading?

08:03.700 --> 08:05.100
-Right here.

08:05.133 --> 08:06.367
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

08:06.400 --> 08:08.500
-Why'd you circle
around the block then?

08:08.533 --> 08:10.400
-Uh, I'm just comin' right here.

08:10.433 --> 08:12.567
-You're just comin' right here
so you circled around the block?

08:12.600 --> 08:15.067
-Yeah.
-Okay. You have a driver's
license and insurance?

08:15.067 --> 08:17.367
The reason for the stop is
you failed to signal
your turn right there.

08:17.400 --> 08:19.733
-All right.
-Can I see your driver's
license and insurance?

08:19.767 --> 08:22.200
-Um, I don't have it.
-You don't have it?

08:22.233 --> 08:23.900
Have you ever been issued
a driver's license?

08:23.933 --> 08:25.633
-Uh, yes, I have.
-Okay.

08:25.667 --> 08:26.833
You just don't have it
with you?

08:26.867 --> 08:29.800
-Yeah.
-Why? Because--
Is it valid still?

08:29.833 --> 08:32.500
-Uh... should be.

08:32.533 --> 08:34.400
-Should be? Okay.

08:34.433 --> 08:35.667
There's nothing wrong with it?

08:35.700 --> 08:38.100
-No.
-You just don't have it? Okay.

08:38.133 --> 08:40.067
Do you have anything
in the vehicle I need
to know about?

08:40.100 --> 08:42.167
Weapons? Huh?

08:42.200 --> 08:45.167
-No.
-Okay. You sure? You were
a little hesitant on that.

08:45.200 --> 08:47.900
-No.
-Okay. Anything else
I need to know about?

08:47.933 --> 08:50.900
Alcohol or something like that?
I can smell alcohol coming out

08:50.933 --> 08:53.067
of the car right here
as I stand here.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.633
So what, you got
alcohol in there?

08:54.667 --> 08:55.700
You been drinking or what?

08:55.733 --> 08:57.267
-Yes, sir.
-Yes to which one?

08:57.300 --> 08:59.067
-Well, I'm not gonna
lie to you.
-Yeah.

08:59.100 --> 09:01.067
Well, I mean, I can smell it,
so that's why I'm--

09:01.067 --> 09:03.633
I'm not lying to you.
I'm joking-- I'm not
joking with you.

09:03.667 --> 09:06.733
So you drinkin' or you have
alcohol open in the vehicle?

09:06.767 --> 09:09.400
-Oh, no.
-I see you have
a cooler over there.

09:09.433 --> 09:11.433
-Yeah.
-Is there alcohol in it?

09:11.467 --> 09:13.067
-Yes, sir.
-Is it open?

09:13.067 --> 09:15.767
-No.
-Were you drinkin'
while you were driving?

09:15.800 --> 09:16.900
-No, sir.
-Okay.

09:16.933 --> 09:18.300
And this is your house?

09:18.333 --> 09:19.967
-Friend of mine
that I'm just coming
over here to see--

09:20.067 --> 09:21.433
-What's your friend's name?
-Bolina.

09:21.467 --> 09:23.067
I was just comin' by
to see if she's here.

09:23.067 --> 09:24.633
-Okay, so she's not
expecting you?

09:24.667 --> 09:26.067
-Uh, no.
-No?

09:26.100 --> 09:27.333
-Yeah.
-Do you think she'll--

09:27.367 --> 09:28.567
-I stay here
every once in a while

09:28.600 --> 09:31.400
'cause I really don't have
a place to stay, so.

09:31.433 --> 09:33.267
-Okay. All right,
stay in the vehicle.

09:33.300 --> 09:34.467
Don't get out
of the vehicle, okay?

09:34.500 --> 09:35.633
-Okay.

09:41.300 --> 09:43.233
-Man on radio:
22-67, traffic.

09:43.267 --> 09:45.800
70600 University.

09:45.833 --> 09:49.800
(indistinct chatter)

09:49.833 --> 09:51.600
-(clattering)

09:51.633 --> 09:53.367
-He's throwing something.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.800
Why you throwing
beer cans out?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.300
-Sir.
-Why you throwing
beer cans out?

10:05.333 --> 10:07.333
-No, I didn't.
-Hey, what are
you talking about,

10:07.367 --> 10:08.933
no, you didn't?
There's one right there.

10:08.967 --> 10:11.267
There's something
that looks like... Jesus.

10:11.300 --> 10:12.733
Keep your hands
on the steering wheel.

10:12.767 --> 10:14.200
Is that your gun
that you just threw out?

10:14.233 --> 10:15.467
-No.
-(turns on radio) 31-81.

10:15.500 --> 10:17.300
Change my 20
to 1,500-27.

10:17.333 --> 10:18.333
Huh?
-No.

10:18.367 --> 10:19.833
-No?

10:19.867 --> 10:22.000
Get out of the vehicle.
Keep your hands up
where I can see 'em.

10:22.033 --> 10:24.167
Get up.
Get your hands up.

10:24.200 --> 10:25.633
Put 'em on the car.

10:26.933 --> 10:28.333
Put your hands
behind your back.

10:28.367 --> 10:30.100
You think you can
just throw stuff
out there like that

10:30.133 --> 10:31.567
and I'm not gonna notice?
-No, that's...

10:31.600 --> 10:33.433
-Really?
There's a gun right here.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.033
-That's-- that's not mine.

10:35.067 --> 10:36.300
-Huh?
-That's not mine.

10:36.333 --> 10:37.667
-That's not yours?
-No.

10:37.700 --> 10:39.967
-None of this is yours?
-No, sir.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.800
-Yeah, that wasn't there
when I walked up.

10:41.833 --> 10:43.467
-That is not mine.
-Okay.

10:46.033 --> 10:47.167
Are you a felon?

10:47.200 --> 10:48.967
You ever been convicted
of a felony?
-No. No.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.567
-Have a seat right here.

10:50.600 --> 10:51.933
Sit down.

10:51.967 --> 10:53.700
Extend your legs
and cross 'em.

10:53.733 --> 10:55.067
Cross 'em.

10:57.300 --> 10:58.400
-(clattering)

10:58.433 --> 11:01.167
It's a Smith & Wesson 9mm.

11:02.533 --> 11:05.367
I'll check the area
once I get my backup over here.

11:05.400 --> 11:06.800
(sighs)

11:06.833 --> 11:08.467
I wonder why
he threw the gun.

11:13.533 --> 11:15.833
There's a magazine
on the side of it.

11:15.867 --> 11:17.500
And it has rounds.

11:19.700 --> 11:21.967
And now I'm gonna run
the gun and him

11:22.067 --> 11:24.800
and see if the gun
comes back stolen...

11:24.833 --> 11:27.133
or if he's a convicted felon.

11:27.167 --> 11:29.633
He'll be in possession
of a firearm

11:29.667 --> 11:31.600
and we'll go from there.

11:33.933 --> 11:35.200
-(radio beeps)
-31-81.

11:35.233 --> 11:37.500
Can you check
a 9mm handgun for stolen?

11:37.533 --> 11:39.967
It's Romeo, Bravo, 5-9.
-Woman on radio: Okay.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.767
-(kittens meowing)
-Clark, can you knock
on the door

11:41.800 --> 11:43.467
and see if you can
get her to come out here?

11:43.500 --> 11:44.967
I want to verify this story.

11:46.667 --> 11:48.067
-Officer:
That's not your gun?

11:48.067 --> 11:49.500
-Man: Uh, no.
-Whose gun is it?

11:49.533 --> 11:52.233
You want to distance yourself
from the gun that

11:52.267 --> 11:54.400
you tossed out the vehicle,
so I'm wondering why.

11:54.433 --> 11:56.400
You ever been arrested
for burglary or theft

11:56.433 --> 11:57.733
or anything like that?
-No, sir.

11:57.767 --> 11:59.067
-No?

11:59.067 --> 12:01.833
-No. I was-- that's--
that's-- I didn't--

12:01.867 --> 12:03.900
-You can see why
I'm thinking that.
Does that make sense?

12:03.933 --> 12:05.500
-I don't even know why...

12:05.533 --> 12:08.067
I mean, I don't know
who lives right there.

12:08.067 --> 12:09.067
I mean, I--

12:09.100 --> 12:10.833
-Try the truth.
-I...

12:10.867 --> 12:12.733
(mumbles)

12:12.767 --> 12:14.633
I don't-- I don't--
I mean, you know what?

12:14.667 --> 12:18.067
If you look at my cooler,
I don't drink Bud Light.

12:18.067 --> 12:19.300
-I don't know
what you were drinking.

12:19.333 --> 12:21.833
The Bud Light was there--
-But I don't drink Bud Light.

12:21.867 --> 12:24.433
-No--
-(police radio chatter)

12:24.467 --> 12:26.367
-10-4. Thank you.
-Oh, no wonder.

12:26.400 --> 12:29.867
Okay, well, you're under arrest
for a felony possession
of a firearm.

12:29.900 --> 12:32.067
-Just happens to be
a convicted felon.

12:32.100 --> 12:33.800
-No wonder you're trying
to ditch the firearm.

12:33.833 --> 12:35.467
Let's go. Get up.

12:37.733 --> 12:39.700
Ready? One, two, three,
stand up.

12:44.900 --> 12:46.400
All right, have
a seat, man.

12:48.067 --> 12:50.067
Now it's all said and done,
do you wanna tell me anything?

12:50.067 --> 12:51.133
-What else can I tell you?

12:51.167 --> 12:52.800
-I mean, you can tell me
the truth.

12:52.833 --> 12:55.067
-It's not my pistol, bro.
It's not.

12:55.100 --> 12:57.633
-Have you ever exited a vehicle
and seen a gun on the ground?

12:57.667 --> 12:59.600
There's no way you're telling
me the truth at all

12:59.633 --> 13:01.933
because listen, first of all,
you said you were comin' here.

13:01.967 --> 13:04.833
You're going eastbound, okay?
I got behind you, you circled

13:04.867 --> 13:06.633
all the way back and then
you pull in to this house

13:06.667 --> 13:08.667
saying that you knew somebody,
and that somebody was here

13:08.700 --> 13:09.967
and was gonna let you in.
-Yeah.

13:10.067 --> 13:11.533
-So you come here
and we knock on the door

13:11.567 --> 13:12.800
and no one's here
to let you in.

13:12.833 --> 13:15.167
Then I ask if you have
open containers in the vehicle,

13:15.200 --> 13:17.367
you say no. Okay?
Then I ask if you have

13:17.400 --> 13:19.233
any weapons in the vehicle,
and then you say no.

13:19.267 --> 13:21.267
I step away from the vehicle
for two seconds,

13:21.300 --> 13:22.867
and there's a gun there.

13:22.900 --> 13:25.267
Okay, well, you're under arrest
for a felony possession
of a firearm

13:25.300 --> 13:28.300
plus driver's license invalid
and you had an open container

13:28.333 --> 13:29.900
in the vehicle, okay?
-(door closes)

13:32.900 --> 13:34.533
-Corporal Franks:
I've always enjoyed
coming down to Florida.

13:34.567 --> 13:36.167
As a kid, I came down
to visit Palm Beach County.

13:36.200 --> 13:37.267
My grandparents lived down here.

13:37.300 --> 13:39.067
So, I always had ties
with the area

13:39.100 --> 13:41.200
and as I grew older
and decided that

13:41.233 --> 13:43.800
law enforcement was
what I wanted to get into

13:43.833 --> 13:46.167
for a professional career,
there was no better place

13:46.200 --> 13:48.100
than coming to West Palm Beach.

13:49.567 --> 13:50.933
We're gonna go
check out the car.

13:50.967 --> 13:53.633
It was going about
two miles an hour

13:53.667 --> 13:55.067
in the lane of traffic.

13:55.067 --> 13:57.367
There's a bunch of cars stopping
and slamming on their brakes,

13:57.400 --> 13:59.100
and there's actually
people waving us down.

13:59.133 --> 14:00.533
Something might be wrong.

14:00.567 --> 14:02.767
I don't know if the driver is
passed out behind the wheel.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.167
-(siren blares)

14:08.567 --> 14:12.167
-Forest Hill west
behind East of Haverhill.
Silver Ford.

14:12.200 --> 14:13.800
-(radio beeps)

14:15.067 --> 14:17.233
-Looks like a medical emergency.
Can you roll EMS?

14:17.267 --> 14:20.500
Vehicle is just strolling
about two miles an hour.

14:20.533 --> 14:21.800
-Hey, no, no, no!

14:21.833 --> 14:24.200
No! No!

14:24.233 --> 14:25.767
No!

14:27.500 --> 14:28.967
-What's up?
-He's not okay.

14:29.067 --> 14:30.633
He's out. He's out.
He is out!

14:30.667 --> 14:34.267
-1, bravo, 2, 2,
the vehicle is going
into the westbound lanes.

14:34.300 --> 14:36.167
-He is out!
He's not okay!

14:36.200 --> 14:37.467
-Woman:
He is out!

14:37.500 --> 14:38.767
-I don't know
if he's dead or not.

14:41.667 --> 14:43.267
-Sheriff's office.
Show me your hands.

14:43.300 --> 14:44.733
Show us your hands.

14:44.767 --> 14:46.633
Show us your hands.
Put your hands up.

14:46.667 --> 14:48.433
Hands up.
You can do it.
-1, bravo, 2-2,

14:48.467 --> 14:50.067
we got a vehicle stop.
We're on the median.

14:50.067 --> 14:51.500
-Put your foot on the brake.

14:54.133 --> 14:55.633
-What happened?
-Well, I just fell asleep.

14:55.667 --> 14:58.067
I'm just tired.
Long day at work.
-Okay. Well, we were concerned.

14:58.067 --> 15:00.433
You were starting
to run off in the wrong way
of traffic, man.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.200
Go ahead and keep
your hands out of your pockets.

15:02.233 --> 15:04.333
-Hey, just get him out for me.
-Step out for me.

15:04.367 --> 15:06.067
Here, I'll put that on top.

15:06.067 --> 15:08.100
-Officer: Hey, you know him?
-Man: No, he was just...

15:08.133 --> 15:09.333
-Step on out for me.

15:10.833 --> 15:12.400
How you feelin' right now?
You all right?

15:12.433 --> 15:15.067
-Yeah, I'm good.
I just got off work, man.

15:15.067 --> 15:16.900
-Step back here.
-What's goin' on, partner?

15:16.933 --> 15:18.633
-I'm on my way home.

15:19.867 --> 15:22.267
-Do you have any
medical issues?
-I'm just tired.

15:22.300 --> 15:23.833
-I'm sorry?
-No.

15:23.867 --> 15:25.700
-Do you feel like
you need the medics right now?

15:25.733 --> 15:28.067
-No.
-Route 2-2, cancel EMS.

15:28.067 --> 15:29.633
Have a seat right here.
-All right.

15:30.967 --> 15:32.200
I'm sorry about that, man.

15:32.233 --> 15:33.967
I'm beat, man.
I'm really tired.

15:34.067 --> 15:36.067
-You got some I.D. on you?
-No, I don't.

15:36.067 --> 15:37.833
-Is this your car?
-This is a rental car.

15:37.867 --> 15:39.733
-Rental car?
How much you had
to drink tonight?

15:39.767 --> 15:42.667
-I went to a bar
and probably had
like two beers.

15:42.700 --> 15:45.200
-Sir, do you realize you were
doing two miles an hour?

15:45.233 --> 15:48.567
-No, I didn't.
I was just trying
to make it home safe, man.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.833
-Okay.
-You're gonna run
my license, right?

15:50.867 --> 15:52.967
-Yeah, I'm going to.
Is there something
I need to know about?

15:53.067 --> 15:54.433
What? What is that?
-Yes. It's suspended.

15:54.467 --> 15:56.767
-For what?
-Unpaid tickets.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.067
-Unpaid tickets?
-Yeah.

15:58.067 --> 16:00.367
-Okay.
-I just wanna
make it home, man.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.467
I have two kids.
-Okay. Do you have
any weapons in the car?

16:02.500 --> 16:03.867
-No, sir.
-Any drugs in the car?

16:03.900 --> 16:05.633
-No, sir.
-Okay. Stay right there for me.

16:05.667 --> 16:06.933
-Okay.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.767
-Right now we're just
gonna search the car.

16:08.800 --> 16:10.100
As you can see,
we got some...

16:10.133 --> 16:11.867
looks like we got
some marijuana right here

16:11.900 --> 16:14.567
in plain view
in this box we have here.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.967
What had started out
was the vehicle was just

16:17.067 --> 16:18.433
traveling about
two miles an hour.

16:18.467 --> 16:20.167
He ended up here
on top of the median.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.700
When we made contact with him,
he was pretty unaware

16:22.733 --> 16:24.500
of what just transpired.

16:24.533 --> 16:27.467
We made contact with him.
It's possible that he's under

16:27.500 --> 16:29.467
the influence of maybe drugs
or alcohol right now.

16:29.500 --> 16:32.367
We're gonna have a DUI unit come
speak to him briefly.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.467
-Well, it's-- I'm--
I'mma be honest with you.

16:34.500 --> 16:35.733
It was my birthday.

16:35.767 --> 16:38.267
My office is down the street
on 10th Avenue.

16:38.300 --> 16:40.900
-Today is your birthday?
-On the 17th.

16:40.933 --> 16:43.133
I'm a family man.
I'm trying to make it home

16:43.167 --> 16:45.133
to my two kids
and my girl

16:45.167 --> 16:47.133
and be able to
take them to school
in the morning.

16:47.167 --> 16:49.533
-Do you remember traveling
in the car tonight?

16:49.567 --> 16:51.200
-Traveling?
-Yeah, you remember driving?

16:51.233 --> 16:52.933
-Yeah, I do.
I-- I-- Yeah.

16:52.967 --> 16:54.633
-You remember traveling
two miles an hour?

16:54.667 --> 16:57.900
-Well, of course,
because I want to
make sure I get home safe.

16:57.933 --> 17:00.533
-Okay. Do you know what
the speed limit is around here?

17:00.567 --> 17:03.567
-Yeah, I do, but
it's better safe
than sorry, you know?

17:03.600 --> 17:05.533
-2-2.

17:05.567 --> 17:07.600
-If I'm driving
two miles per hour,

17:07.633 --> 17:10.433
I mean, I feel like
I can make it home safe.

17:10.467 --> 17:13.633
-How did your car wind up here,
stopped in the middle
of the median?

17:13.667 --> 17:14.900
-I'm not sure.

17:14.933 --> 17:17.933
But I might have pulled over
after the sirens.

17:17.967 --> 17:20.533
-So they turned on
the lights and sirens,

17:20.567 --> 17:22.633
and you pulled over
and stopped right here
in the median?

17:22.667 --> 17:24.167
-I don't know what happened.
-Huh?

17:24.200 --> 17:26.533
-Yeah.
-I have some tasks
I'd like you to do

17:26.567 --> 17:28.433
to help me determine
if you're safe to drive.

17:28.467 --> 17:31.067
Go ahead and stand up for me.
If you can just put
your left foot on

17:31.100 --> 17:32.833
that yellow line
and then your right foot

17:32.867 --> 17:35.567
in front with the heel
and toe touching
just like this.

17:35.600 --> 17:37.333
And then if you can put
your hands flat at your sides

17:37.367 --> 17:38.767
and just stay like that
until I tell you.

17:38.800 --> 17:41.200
-I've never been good
at this, but...

17:41.233 --> 17:42.767
All right.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.700
-All right, stay like that
until I tell you.

17:44.733 --> 17:46.067
Now, when I tell you--
-Oh!

17:48.133 --> 17:49.700
I'm not good at--
with the balance.

17:49.733 --> 17:52.200
-Let's step--
step over this way.
You're gonna skip that.

17:52.233 --> 17:54.100
We're gonna skip that one.
I don't want you to fall.

17:54.133 --> 17:56.100
Just stand right there for me.
Face my car.

17:57.733 --> 17:59.833
Point your toe so that
your foot's parallel
to the ground.

17:59.867 --> 18:02.567
Count out loud.
1,001, 1,002, 1,003,

18:02.600 --> 18:03.867
until I tell you to stop.

18:03.900 --> 18:05.733
You may begin
whenever you're ready.

18:10.400 --> 18:11.633
-(mumbles)

18:11.667 --> 18:13.233
-If you understand
the instructions,

18:13.267 --> 18:15.067
go ahead and begin
whenever you're ready.

18:30.267 --> 18:33.067
-Should I switch legs or?
-Let's try this.

18:33.067 --> 18:34.500
What I'd like for you
to do is stay there.

18:34.533 --> 18:36.500
Face the car for me.
Feet together.

18:36.533 --> 18:38.467
I want you to lean
forward at the waist,

18:38.500 --> 18:40.133
put your hands
behind you like that,

18:40.167 --> 18:43.433
close your eyes
and say the alphabet
for me one more time, please.

18:43.467 --> 18:48.967
-A, B, C, D, E, F--

18:49.067 --> 18:51.233
-All right, sir,
you're under arrest
for DUI.

18:51.267 --> 18:54.300
Driving that vehicle under
the influence of alcohol
and/or controlled substances

18:54.333 --> 18:57.067
to the point that
your normal faculties
are impaired.

18:57.067 --> 19:01.167
-Oh, my god, officer.
I just want to make it home
to my kids, man.

19:01.200 --> 19:03.333
-I understand that, sir.
-You don't understand.

19:03.367 --> 19:05.733
I had a long day--
a long day at work.

19:05.767 --> 19:07.933
I'm just on my way home
and I'm tired.
-Okay, sir,

19:07.967 --> 19:10.167
I'm not here to lecture you,
but you're putting yourself

19:10.200 --> 19:12.567
and everybody else
on the road in a great deal
of danger, all right?

19:12.600 --> 19:14.667
Everybody else out here wants
to make it home, too.

19:14.700 --> 19:16.500
Watch your head
and have a seat for me.

19:16.533 --> 19:17.933
Watch your head going in.

19:19.567 --> 19:21.600
-On my birthday?
(indistinct)

19:21.633 --> 19:23.300
On my birthday, man?

19:23.333 --> 19:25.567
-Yes, sir.
-Hey, Emanuel, this is what
I need you to understand.

19:25.600 --> 19:28.533
All right? You were traveling
two miles an hour on this
roadway, all right?

19:28.567 --> 19:31.533
God forbid something happen
to you or your family,

19:31.567 --> 19:33.700
I might be knocking
on their door

19:33.733 --> 19:35.600
saying they need to go
to the hospital, okay?

19:35.633 --> 19:37.067
I understand
it's your birthday,

19:37.067 --> 19:38.900
but you gotta make
better decisions,
you know, man?

19:38.933 --> 19:41.867
-No, I understand, man.
I was just trying to make--
I live around the corner.

19:41.900 --> 19:43.400
I was just trying
to make it home, boss.

19:43.433 --> 19:46.133
Like, come on, man.
-You should have just
called a cab, you know?

19:46.167 --> 19:48.667
-But I'm not perfect, boss.
-I'm not here to judge you.

19:50.200 --> 19:52.367
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.333
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:54.367 --> 19:55.500
Cover is code three.

19:55.533 --> 19:58.500
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:05.367 --> 20:07.333
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:07.367 --> 20:08.533
-(theme music playing)
