WEBVTT

00:00.335 --> 00:02.360
Previously on "Heartland"...

00:02.414 --> 00:05.673
Georgie, hey!
What're you doing?

00:05.807 --> 00:08.274
He wanted out, so...
I'm gonna follow him.

00:10.578 --> 00:13.145
See? That's where he was going.

00:13.214 --> 00:15.448
Hey, buddy, you'll be okay.

00:15.516 --> 00:18.150
Buddy. I like that.
Bear and Buddy.

00:18.219 --> 00:20.353
- Are you going somewhere?
- Yeah.

00:20.421 --> 00:22.188
To live with my dad for a while
in a Manitoba.

00:22.256 --> 00:23.690
Ty!

00:25.326 --> 00:27.792
Back. Back, Bear.

00:27.860 --> 00:29.661
Good boy! Good boy!

00:31.631 --> 00:33.732
Bear might make
a good police horse.

00:33.799 --> 00:36.235
You really think he's made
of that kind of stuff?

00:36.302 --> 00:37.669
He's a special horse.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.074

01:13.138 --> 01:16.173
Good boy.

01:16.241 --> 01:19.643
Good boy, Bear.

01:30.421 --> 01:33.523
- Hey, Georgie!
- Oh, hey, you're back!

01:33.591 --> 01:36.793
Nice horse. But did you
really need a new one?

01:36.860 --> 01:39.529
Well, Bear's not mine.

01:39.597 --> 01:41.765
His owner passed away,
so Amy took him on.

01:41.832 --> 01:46.603
He likes to stay active,
so I ride him as much as I can.

01:46.671 --> 01:48.104
God, hi.

01:50.408 --> 01:52.241
Um... and this is his buddy.

01:52.310 --> 01:55.144
His name's...
well, actually, Buddy.

01:55.212 --> 01:59.182
Cool. Maybe we can take 'em
on a ride sometime...

01:59.249 --> 02:00.616
like tomorrow.

02:02.419 --> 02:05.421
Yeah, sure. Um... I'll have to ask
Jack's if he's working with Buddy,

02:05.488 --> 02:07.156
but I that sounds good.

02:07.224 --> 02:10.193
Great. It's a date then.

02:13.263 --> 02:14.996
I'll pack us a lunch.

02:15.064 --> 02:16.531
Oh no, you still have
to take me out to lunch.

02:16.598 --> 02:19.034
I won that bet fair and square.

02:20.636 --> 02:24.206
All right, we are almost ready.

02:24.273 --> 02:26.274
- Yay! Waffle time!
- Thanks, Lisa.

02:26.342 --> 02:28.576
You two are really loving this
brunch tradition, aren't you?

02:28.644 --> 02:30.445
My pleasure as always.

02:30.512 --> 02:33.315
I got it!

02:33.382 --> 02:35.550
Hello there. Come on in.

02:37.085 --> 02:39.387
Hi. I'm Carson Heatley.
I have a meeting with Lou today.

02:39.455 --> 02:41.055
- Is... he in?
- Uh-huh.

02:41.122 --> 02:43.257
Uh, You must be the inspector
from our insurance company.

02:43.325 --> 02:44.726
I'm Lou.

02:44.793 --> 02:47.194
- You're Lou.
- Yeah, it's short for Louise.

02:47.262 --> 02:49.163
Well, let me call you that then.

02:49.231 --> 02:51.499
I have an Uncle Lew,
and he looks nothing like you.

02:51.567 --> 02:53.334
Um...

02:53.402 --> 02:55.602
Uh, we just recently renovated
the barn loft,

02:55.670 --> 02:57.937
and we want to have it added
to the existing policy.

02:58.005 --> 02:59.806
All right, well,
let's scope it out.

02:59.874 --> 03:01.742
Amy, would you mind taking
Carson out to the barn?

03:01.809 --> 03:04.711
Um, I'm sorry, but I actually have
a client arriving any minute.

03:04.779 --> 03:06.012
I can't.

03:06.080 --> 03:09.282
- And we'll see you soon. Bye!
- Bye, Mommy!

03:09.350 --> 03:10.751
- Bye, honey.
- Nice to meet you, Carson.

03:10.818 --> 03:13.553
Nice to meet you.

03:13.621 --> 03:16.022
- After you, Louise.
- Okay.

03:25.665 --> 03:28.034
Hey, Casey.
Everything all right?

03:28.102 --> 03:29.604
Not really, no.

03:29.630 --> 03:31.710
- What's the matter?
- Just another freezing cold shower

03:31.772 --> 03:34.339
followed by an even colder breakfast.

03:34.407 --> 03:37.109
No hot water and no stove...
again.

03:37.176 --> 03:39.344
Well, check the propane tanks?

03:39.412 --> 03:41.079
Of course I
checked the tanks, they're full.

03:41.147 --> 03:44.616
Well, maybe there's something
wrong with the regulator.

03:44.683 --> 03:46.318
I gotta say,
I never saw this coming.

03:46.386 --> 03:48.387
Really? 'Cause it keeps happening.

03:48.454 --> 03:50.222
I meant I never saw myself
living in a tin can

03:50.290 --> 03:52.357
parked on the rodeo grounds
at this point in my life.

03:52.425 --> 03:54.526
Oh, come on, honey.

03:56.061 --> 03:58.195
It's part of your job. You're on
the road all the time.

03:58.263 --> 03:59.803
I know, it's just...

03:59.856 --> 04:03.034
starting to feel like I need a real
home to come back to, you know?

04:03.101 --> 04:06.237
Okay, calm down. We'll take
a look at it after practice.

04:06.305 --> 04:08.706
It'll be all right.

04:08.774 --> 04:10.642
Thanks.

04:17.416 --> 04:21.541
Not right now.
I'll call him later. Yeah.

04:21.719 --> 04:23.220
- Amy, right?
- Yeah.

04:23.288 --> 04:25.128
- I'll be with you in a second.
- Okay.

04:25.180 --> 04:27.224
Don't believe it. She's been
on work calls all morning.

04:27.292 --> 04:28.559
Is Budget Buster in the trailer?

04:28.626 --> 04:31.695
No. We let him ride
up front with us.

04:32.014 --> 04:33.663
Hey.

04:33.730 --> 04:36.166
Hey, Olivia. What're you doing here?

04:36.233 --> 04:38.935
I might ask you the same question.

04:39.003 --> 04:40.670
She wants Amy to look
at her jumping horse.

04:40.737 --> 04:43.306
No. This was my
stepmother's idea.

04:43.374 --> 04:46.343
I actually think that
it's a waste of time.

04:46.410 --> 04:49.179
O-kay, I think I'll get going.

04:49.246 --> 04:52.181
- See you tomorrow.
- See ya.

04:52.248 --> 04:54.116
Tomorrow, huh?

04:55.585 --> 04:57.752
Okay, Olivia,
I'm ready to have a look.

05:03.193 --> 05:05.194
So what exactly is going on?

05:05.261 --> 05:07.096
He just keeps screwing up.

05:07.163 --> 05:09.064
Do you think you could you be
a little more specific?

05:09.132 --> 05:11.433
Sure. He cost about
a hundred thousand dollars,

05:11.501 --> 05:12.934
has a great coach,
the best of everything,

05:13.002 --> 05:15.136
and hasn't come close
to winning a ribbon in months.

05:15.204 --> 05:19.173
Maybe it's better if you just
show me what's happening.

05:33.489 --> 05:35.215
- Whoa!
- See? That's what he does!

05:35.267 --> 05:36.336
He's going toward the fence!

05:36.428 --> 05:38.104
Okay, just-just circle him around,
circle him.

05:38.193 --> 05:40.761
That's it, that's it.

05:40.829 --> 05:42.435
Settle down.

05:44.900 --> 05:46.401
It happened again?

05:46.468 --> 05:48.436
Of course it did.
He was supposed to be champion

05:48.504 --> 05:50.670
and this is what
we're stuck with?

05:50.738 --> 05:52.272
You're okay?

05:52.340 --> 05:54.474
Yeah. Just go back
to your phone call.

05:56.310 --> 05:58.512
Hi. Sorry about that,
where were we?

06:00.443 --> 06:03.569
S09E08
Reckless Abandon

06:03.741 --> 06:06.999
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

06:40.795 --> 06:43.188
You know, that daughter
of yours is a real cutie.

06:43.786 --> 06:45.090
Those big blue eyes and dimples.

06:45.157 --> 06:46.524
Yeah, trust me,

06:46.593 --> 06:49.360
she knows how to use them
to get what she wants.

06:49.428 --> 06:52.206
It's a pretty sweet deal,
having family around

06:52.299 --> 06:54.031
to give you and your husband
a helping hand.

06:54.396 --> 06:56.507
Oh, yeah.

06:57.235 --> 06:59.536
Actually, my husband
and I separated...

06:59.605 --> 07:01.238
not, uh, too long ago.

07:01.306 --> 07:04.526
Oh, I'm sorry.
I... I saw the ring.

07:05.569 --> 07:08.579
Hey, it took me a while
to take mine off too.

07:09.183 --> 07:13.511
See, me and my ex, we were...
separated about a year ago.

07:15.397 --> 07:16.626
How 'bout you?

07:16.731 --> 07:19.956
Like I said, it was...
pretty recently.

07:20.024 --> 07:21.357
Hmm.

07:21.425 --> 07:23.493
It plays with your head,
doesn't it?

07:23.974 --> 07:26.462
Being single again.

07:26.530 --> 07:28.431
I haven't even waded back
into the dating pool yet.

07:28.499 --> 07:31.366
Pfft! I can't even imagine that.

07:31.883 --> 07:34.336
Well, I... I can imagine it.

07:34.614 --> 07:38.473
I was just beginning to wonder
if I'd ever...

07:38.841 --> 07:44.046
find somebody who I actually
wanted to ask out for coffee.

07:44.113 --> 07:47.028
Uh... muffins! Uh...

07:47.635 --> 07:48.228
Excuse me?

07:48.294 --> 07:50.385
I just, I left some muffins
in the-in the oven.

07:50.484 --> 07:50.906
Oh, okay.

07:50.985 --> 07:53.492
Yeah, so I'm just gonna get back
to the house, but you're...

07:53.545 --> 07:54.655
You're okay here?

07:54.722 --> 07:57.524
- Yeah. No problem.
- Okay.

08:01.696 --> 08:04.631
Muffins?! Seriously?!

08:04.699 --> 08:06.300
What is wrong with me?!

08:06.368 --> 08:09.870
- How's it going up there?
- Oh! Fine. Yup, good.

08:09.938 --> 08:13.698
We're-we were just talking
about... the loft.

08:14.275 --> 08:16.677
What else would you be
talking to the inspector about?

08:16.744 --> 08:20.624
Exactly. Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

08:21.549 --> 08:23.216
Okay. What's up with her?

08:23.284 --> 08:27.721
You know Lou. Stuff like
that really stresses her out.

08:27.789 --> 08:30.923
I still can't believe how harsh
Olivia's being on this guy.

08:30.991 --> 08:33.558
No wonder he's having
trouble jumping.

08:33.626 --> 08:36.361
You know what? I think Olivia is putting
just as much pressure on herself.

08:36.429 --> 08:37.797
You know? There's a lot
of expectations

08:37.865 --> 08:40.799
when it comes to riding a
high-performance jumping horse.

08:40.868 --> 08:42.902
So you think Olivia's the problem?

08:42.970 --> 08:45.738
Well, I've seen it before,

08:45.806 --> 08:47.840
do remember the jouster?

08:47.908 --> 08:50.475
You know, maybe Olivia's transmitting
her nerves onto this guy,

08:50.543 --> 08:51.943
so let's just let him chill out

08:52.011 --> 08:54.946
and then we'll see how he does
with a calm rider.

09:00.352 --> 09:01.586
Ungh! Ungh!

09:03.923 --> 09:06.591
Why aren't you using
a proper wrench on that?

09:06.659 --> 09:07.892
I've changed a regulator before,

09:07.959 --> 09:09.425
I think I know what I'm doing.

09:09.504 --> 09:11.998
It's a brass fitting, Tim,
you're gonna scar it up...

09:12.050 --> 09:14.665
Let me just finish this
so we can get outta here

09:14.733 --> 09:16.400
and Casey can stop ranting
about her living conditions.

09:16.467 --> 09:17.701
I wouldn't say she was ranting.

09:17.769 --> 09:19.336
I understand her frustration.

09:19.404 --> 09:22.572
You remember what it was like,
always being on the road.

09:22.640 --> 09:25.008
She has a way of dropping hints.

09:25.075 --> 09:27.010
I looked it up. It's called
passive-aggressive. I hate it.

09:27.077 --> 09:28.545
What hints?

09:28.612 --> 09:30.446
Hints. She's dropping them
like bombs.

09:30.514 --> 09:33.750
Jack, she's fishing...
for an invitation.

09:33.817 --> 09:35.552
To live with me, to move in.

09:35.619 --> 09:38.721
- She never said that!
- Not in so many words.

09:38.789 --> 09:41.558
Then don't jump to conclusions.

09:41.625 --> 09:42.959
I think I know her better
than you do.

09:43.027 --> 09:44.325
Just ask her.

09:44.393 --> 09:47.429
There's no sense in both of you
beating around a bush.

09:58.772 --> 10:01.577
We had
chocolate chips and whip cream!

10:01.644 --> 10:04.546
- Really?
- C'mon! Let's go build a fort!

10:04.613 --> 10:05.880
All right, I'll be right there.

10:05.948 --> 10:07.748
Don't go bouncing on the bed...

10:07.816 --> 10:10.350
or off the walls
for that matter.

10:10.418 --> 10:12.864
Sorry. That's a little bit of sugar.

10:12.930 --> 10:13.365
Yeah.

10:13.418 --> 10:16.624
Hey, um, I noticed that the very
cute inspector's still here.

10:16.692 --> 10:18.525
Cute? I hadn't noticed.

10:18.594 --> 10:19.827
Oh no, you didn't notice
he was cute?

10:19.895 --> 10:21.596
Or that he was flirting
with you, Louise?

10:21.663 --> 10:23.664
Yeah, no, I got that.

10:23.732 --> 10:25.566
Especially when he brought up
going for coffee.

10:25.634 --> 10:29.603
- He asked you out?
- Well, I don't... I think he was going to

10:29.670 --> 10:31.705
and I kind of split
before it got awkward,

10:31.772 --> 10:34.074
which made things
more awkward and...

10:34.142 --> 10:35.309
Why would you do that?

10:35.376 --> 10:37.411
Because, Lisa, I don't wanna
go out on a date.

10:37.479 --> 10:39.313
It's not a date, it's coffee.

10:39.380 --> 10:42.483
And he seems like a very nice
guy, and he is cute.

10:42.550 --> 10:45.319
- Lisa!
- Coming!

10:49.390 --> 10:50.723
So everything's working again.

10:50.790 --> 10:53.593
Okay, great! I'm gonna hit
the road then.

10:53.660 --> 10:55.595
Thanks so much, Jack.
I really appreciate it.

10:55.662 --> 10:57.062
Thanks, Buddy.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.368
What about me?

11:04.671 --> 11:07.240
- What is going on?
- What do you mean?

11:07.307 --> 11:08.807
I mean, you might be good
at a lot of things,

11:08.875 --> 11:11.376
but hiding your feelings...
not one of 'em.

11:11.444 --> 11:13.811
Well... it's nothing, really.

11:15.648 --> 11:17.549
All your complaining,
about the trailer

11:17.617 --> 11:20.735
and not having a home...

11:20.986 --> 11:22.420
Pretty obvious
what it's all about.

11:22.488 --> 11:25.457
You're not so good at hiding
what you're thinking either.

11:25.525 --> 11:27.142
And what would that be?

11:27.195 --> 11:30.595
I know you wanna move into
Big River with me, right?

11:30.663 --> 11:34.698
What?
I never even considered that.

11:34.766 --> 11:37.268
- Really?
- Really.

11:37.335 --> 11:40.371
Although that is
an interesting idea.

11:40.438 --> 11:41.838
You know what?
I'm late for a meeting.

11:41.906 --> 11:43.274
Wanna talk about this later?

11:43.341 --> 11:46.231
Yeah! Have fun.
Give me a call.

11:49.381 --> 11:50.714
Huh.

11:52.516 --> 11:55.418
Uh... come in!

11:58.422 --> 11:59.956
I just finished up out there,

12:00.024 --> 12:01.558
so you should be hearing from
one of our insurance drones

12:01.625 --> 12:03.060
in the next couple of days.

12:03.127 --> 12:05.028
Okay. Well, thank you.

12:05.096 --> 12:06.897
Yeah.

12:08.666 --> 12:09.933
- Carson? Um...
- Yeah.

12:10.001 --> 12:11.735
Listen, I own a Dude Ranch.

12:11.803 --> 12:14.670
It's more just like a couple
of cabins, really,

12:14.738 --> 12:17.206
but, um, I was thinking about
doing some renovations

12:17.273 --> 12:20.475
and I could use some
professional advice.

12:20.543 --> 12:22.878
Yeah, well, my brain
is yours to pick.

12:22.946 --> 12:26.348
Great! Maybe we could
chat about it sometime...

12:26.416 --> 12:27.850
over a coffee?

12:29.245 --> 12:31.520
Uh, yeah.
How is tomorrow afternoon?

12:31.588 --> 12:33.756
Uh, yeah... I can do that.

12:33.824 --> 12:35.791
Do you want to meet at Maggie's
in town?

12:35.859 --> 12:38.259
Sure. I'll see you there,
Louise.

12:38.327 --> 12:39.872
Okay.

12:46.702 --> 12:47.936
I'm just getting some juice
for Katie.

12:48.003 --> 12:49.637
I was just... All I was doing...

12:49.705 --> 12:51.072
You don't have to explain it
to me.

12:51.140 --> 12:52.473
I think it's great, Lou.

12:52.541 --> 12:54.843
No it's not. This is crazy. I...

12:54.910 --> 12:56.211
I'm gonna cancel. I'm sorry...

12:56.278 --> 12:57.912
No, no, come on!
Why would you do that?

12:57.980 --> 13:01.349
Because, Lisa, this just...
this just feels so wrong.

13:01.416 --> 13:02.883
It's normal.

13:02.951 --> 13:05.753
Do you know how long it took me
to move on from Dan?

13:05.820 --> 13:07.788
You just, you know,
you take baby steps,

13:07.856 --> 13:11.559
like going for a casual coffee
at a diner that you own.

13:11.627 --> 13:14.228
How much safer can it get?

13:14.296 --> 13:15.896
Yeah.

13:20.802 --> 13:22.870
So I figure we'll start
with a little flat work.

13:22.937 --> 13:24.805
And then you'll jump him?

13:24.873 --> 13:26.840
No, I'd like to wait till Ty
gets back from his conference

13:26.908 --> 13:29.009
to rule out anything physical.

13:30.511 --> 13:32.221
Who's that?

13:34.482 --> 13:37.818
RCMP?
I think it's the City Police.

13:37.886 --> 13:39.686
Well, what would they be
doing all the way out here?

13:39.754 --> 13:42.889
I don't believe it.

13:42.956 --> 13:44.323
- Hi.
- Hello!

13:44.391 --> 13:46.035
- Amy Fleming?
- Yeah.

13:46.075 --> 13:48.694
- Sergeant Josh Cooke.
- You're from the mounted division.

13:48.762 --> 13:50.062
Yeah. Sorry I didn't call first,

13:50.130 --> 13:51.998
but I was looking at
another horse in the area.

13:52.065 --> 13:54.400
- That's okay.
- What's going on? What's this about?

13:54.467 --> 13:56.202
He's come to see Bear.

13:56.618 --> 13:59.838
I applied for him to be
a mounted police horse.

14:03.609 --> 14:04.876
From everything I've read
on your site,

14:04.944 --> 14:07.645
Bear seems to be perfect
for your program.

14:07.713 --> 14:10.315
Well, he's a good height.
Nice colour.

14:10.382 --> 14:11.616
Has he been checked out recently?

14:11.684 --> 14:13.151
Yeah, my husband's a vet.

14:13.219 --> 14:15.720
Actually, Bear saved his life
a while back.

14:15.788 --> 14:18.723
- Really?
- Yeah, we were on this really steep trail

14:18.791 --> 14:21.125
and Ty fell over a ledge.

14:21.193 --> 14:22.626
I tied a rope around Bear's saddle

14:22.694 --> 14:24.528
and he pulled us back to safety.

14:24.595 --> 14:26.864
He never flinched.
He just stayed calm

14:26.932 --> 14:28.598
and did exactly
what I asked of him.

14:28.666 --> 14:31.364
Hmm. Impressive.

14:33.238 --> 14:34.705
If I come by tomorrow, can we do
some work with Bear in the pen?

14:34.772 --> 14:37.274
Sure. Yeah, I'll set aside
some time.

14:37.380 --> 14:38.843
Thanks.

14:39.266 --> 14:41.744
I have a good feeling about you, Bear.

14:46.383 --> 14:47.950
So you were keeping this
a secret from me?

14:48.017 --> 14:50.219
I didn't want to say anything until
I knew they were interested.

14:50.287 --> 14:54.022
Well, obviously, they are. He was
practically drooling over Bear.

14:54.090 --> 14:56.359
What happens if he gets accepted?
Are you just gonna let him go?

14:56.426 --> 14:59.795
We'll cross
that bridge when we come to it, okay?

15:10.406 --> 15:12.307
I like your hair like that.

15:12.375 --> 15:15.977
Oh, I was just...
playing around with it.

15:16.045 --> 15:17.512
Everything okay?

15:17.580 --> 15:19.981
Uh, yeah.

15:20.049 --> 15:21.983
Amy said Stephen came by earlier.

15:22.051 --> 15:23.384
It must have been nice
to see him again.

15:23.451 --> 15:25.919
Yeah, we're going on
a trail ride tomorrow.

15:25.987 --> 15:30.324
Oh, yeah? Is this...
trail ride like a date?

15:30.392 --> 15:33.160
Sorry. None of my business.

15:33.228 --> 15:36.363
- It's okay.
- No, I mean I was...

15:36.431 --> 15:39.099
I mean, what is a "date"
anyway, right?

15:39.167 --> 15:40.500
It's just some stupid label

15:40.568 --> 15:42.268
that people put on
spending time with someone

15:42.336 --> 15:45.706
that makes it this big
pressure-filled thing.

15:45.773 --> 15:47.874
I totally get why you're nervous.

15:47.942 --> 15:49.309
I never said that.

15:49.376 --> 15:51.078
- You know what?
- Here's what you're gonna do.

15:51.145 --> 15:53.379
You just relax and have fun.

15:53.447 --> 15:55.315
I mean, that's what a date
is supposed to be anyways.

15:55.382 --> 15:57.317
Except don't think of it
as a "date."

15:57.384 --> 16:01.254
It's just coffee.
I mean, a ride.

16:01.322 --> 16:03.356
It's just a ride.

16:23.043 --> 16:25.177
Good boy.

16:25.245 --> 16:26.578
He travels great.

16:26.646 --> 16:29.181
Yeah, he really moves out nice.

16:30.682 --> 16:32.803
Okay, let's see
what he can really do.

16:40.159 --> 16:42.127
Good boy, Bear!

16:42.194 --> 16:44.896
Wow.

16:51.369 --> 16:54.638
Okay, let's try something tougher.

17:10.621 --> 17:11.788
Wow. I have to say,

17:11.855 --> 17:13.990
he's one of the calmest horses
I've ever met.

17:14.057 --> 17:16.425
There's no question
Bear has what it takes.

17:16.493 --> 17:18.194
Now we don't have a big budget
to pull from,

17:18.262 --> 17:19.996
but I'd love to take him on.

17:20.063 --> 17:23.266
This isn't about the money.
I just want Bear to be happy.

17:23.334 --> 17:25.167
Actually, I think he was born to do this.

17:25.234 --> 17:27.170
I get that feeling as well.

17:27.237 --> 17:29.406
I'll come back in a couple days
to pick him up.

17:29.492 --> 17:30.337
That soon?

17:30.442 --> 17:33.142
Uh, the next training session
starts in a week.

17:33.210 --> 17:35.178
Okay. Yeah, I'll have him ready.

17:35.245 --> 17:37.446
Thanks, Amy.

17:46.290 --> 17:48.524
Hey.

17:49.960 --> 17:51.860
Hey.

17:51.928 --> 17:54.463
- You all right?
- Yeah!

17:54.531 --> 17:55.798
I'm great.

17:55.865 --> 17:58.099
Listen, I was thinking about
what we talked about yesterday,

17:58.167 --> 17:59.535
about you moving into my place.

17:59.602 --> 18:01.403
I have a better idea.

18:01.471 --> 18:02.838
And I was...

18:05.074 --> 18:07.275
Wouldn't that be perfect?

18:07.344 --> 18:09.311
Yeah.

18:09.379 --> 18:10.979
It's just over
on Fraser Meadow Road.

18:11.047 --> 18:12.780
It's got a four-acre lot.

18:12.848 --> 18:15.049
Really. Good location.

18:15.116 --> 18:16.283
I know, especially for that price.

18:16.352 --> 18:18.252
And look at the interior.

18:18.320 --> 18:21.756
It's just so open, there's
so much sunlight in there.

18:21.824 --> 18:23.991
Yeah... yeah, it's open.
There's uh...

18:24.059 --> 18:25.893
there's sunlight in there.

18:25.961 --> 18:27.729
There's an open house today. Do you
think you might wanna see it with me?

18:27.796 --> 18:30.231
I'd love to, but I gotta set
up for practice.

18:30.298 --> 18:32.800
It's all right.
I'll check it out by myself,

18:32.868 --> 18:34.201
let you know what I think.

18:34.269 --> 18:36.170
Yeah, that's probably good.
Do that.

18:42.978 --> 18:44.811
So? What'd the police say?

18:44.880 --> 18:47.047
They want him.

18:47.115 --> 18:48.916
Well, that's a good thing,
isn't it?

18:48.984 --> 18:50.445
I think so.

18:50.551 --> 18:52.853
So you just went ahead
and crossed that bridge, huh?

18:52.921 --> 18:55.255
Georgie, the sergeant said
that Bear is perfect for this.

18:55.322 --> 18:57.190
Okay, it's not like I want him
to go.

18:57.258 --> 19:00.226
- Then don't do it!
- It's what's best for Bear.

19:00.341 --> 19:01.726
He was amazing when Ty fell.

19:01.792 --> 19:05.031
And this is his reward? Being sent away?

19:14.941 --> 19:17.142
I remember how sure you were

19:17.210 --> 19:20.413
that Buddy was meant to be
a ranch horse.

19:20.480 --> 19:24.049
I needed some convincing,
but you were right.

19:24.117 --> 19:27.052
Buddy's been great...

19:27.120 --> 19:30.255
and he's been a whole lot
happier since...

19:30.323 --> 19:32.858
Well, since I put him to work.

19:36.495 --> 19:40.332
Bear deserves the same thing,
don't you think?

19:44.770 --> 19:46.405
I know horses like
to have a purpose,

19:46.472 --> 19:49.107
but they also need
companionship.

19:49.175 --> 19:50.409
I'm sure Bear will make
new friends

19:50.476 --> 19:52.710
with the other police horses.

19:52.778 --> 19:55.947
- Going for coffee and doughnuts.
- This isn't funny.

19:56.014 --> 19:58.449
Just trying to cheer you up.

20:00.185 --> 20:02.886
I guess I'm not
the most fun person

20:02.955 --> 20:04.422
to be around right now.

20:04.489 --> 20:06.857
It-it's okay.

20:09.227 --> 20:11.829
You seem kind of nervous.
Is everything okay?

20:11.896 --> 20:14.130
Nervous?

20:14.198 --> 20:17.033
Well, yeah. Have things
changed between us?

20:17.101 --> 20:18.401
Changed? Like how?

20:18.469 --> 20:20.870
Well, you called this a date.

20:20.938 --> 20:23.351
Does that mean we're supposed
to be more than friends now?

20:24.976 --> 20:27.077
Or not. Everything can just
stay totally the same.

20:27.144 --> 20:29.446
No, it... it's not that.

20:31.148 --> 20:35.485
I... have something
I need to tell you.

20:37.085 --> 20:39.455
My mom got a job
in Manitoba,

20:39.990 --> 20:43.255
so I won't have to travel
so far between my parents.

20:44.828 --> 20:48.464
I'm leaving Hudson...
for good this time.

21:01.116 --> 21:03.494
Just act natural.

21:04.652 --> 21:06.884
You're not doing anything wrong.

21:08.523 --> 21:10.691
You're not doing anything at all.

21:10.758 --> 21:12.993
It's just coffee.

21:13.061 --> 21:16.497
I drink coffee,
obviously he drinks coffee.

21:16.565 --> 21:21.134
We're just sitting at the same
table drinking coffee together.

21:21.202 --> 21:23.704
It's. Just. Coffee.

21:26.436 --> 21:28.408
What am I doing?

21:31.212 --> 21:33.480
Hey.

21:34.918 --> 21:37.117
- Hey, Louise.
- Hi.

21:37.184 --> 21:38.551
- How're doing?
- Good to see you.

21:38.620 --> 21:40.153
Um, could we please get
two coffees

21:40.221 --> 21:43.122
- for our business meeting?
- Mmhmm.

21:43.189 --> 21:44.490
It's all business, huh?

21:44.557 --> 21:45.958
Uh, look, you know, like I said,

21:46.026 --> 21:47.359
I have some questions...

21:47.427 --> 21:50.129
- Right. Your renovation.
- Yeah.

21:50.196 --> 21:52.765
So is... this your regular haunt?

21:52.833 --> 21:56.769
Uh, yeah, I guess you could
say that since I kind of...

21:56.837 --> 21:58.137
well, I own it.

21:58.204 --> 22:01.473
- Really? So you run two businesses?
- Yeah.

22:01.541 --> 22:04.609
- Quite the entrepreneur.
- Yeah, or just plain crazy.

22:04.677 --> 22:08.446
Nah. I mean, people say that
you carve out our own niche,

22:08.514 --> 22:12.483
but the truth is,
your niche carves out you.

22:12.551 --> 22:14.318
- Thank you.
- There you go.

22:14.386 --> 22:16.721
And um... what would
your niche be?

22:16.789 --> 22:18.089
Adrenaline.

22:18.157 --> 22:21.192
Heli-skiing, base jumping...
white water rafting.

22:21.260 --> 22:23.962
So, basically, terrifying yourself.

22:24.030 --> 22:25.729
I actually find it scarier
living a life

22:25.797 --> 22:28.132
where you're in a safe little bubble,

22:28.200 --> 22:30.134
'cause that just ain't living.

22:30.202 --> 22:34.071
- Hmm.
- Let me take you skydiving this weekend.

22:34.139 --> 22:35.506
- Uh...
- We'll get you outta your bubble.

22:35.574 --> 22:37.775
No. I... feel no need

22:37.842 --> 22:42.480
to jump out of a perfectly
operational aircraft.

22:42.548 --> 22:45.183
It's your loss.

22:48.387 --> 22:51.189
Where's Amy? Why isn't she
working with Budget Buster?

22:51.256 --> 22:52.624
I don't know. She's busy.

22:52.690 --> 22:55.458
One of our horses got accepted
into the Calgary Police Force.

22:55.526 --> 22:59.262
Congratulations. But we're paying good
money to have Amy to fix my horse.

22:59.330 --> 23:00.664
Chill out, Olivia.

23:00.731 --> 23:02.399
It's not like you're her only client.

23:02.466 --> 23:04.534
The world doesn't stop
because you have a problem.

23:04.602 --> 23:07.237
I knew Amy couldn't do it.

23:07.305 --> 23:09.272
You know what? If there's
something wrong with your horse,

23:09.340 --> 23:11.107
- she'll figure it out.
- If?!

23:11.175 --> 23:13.309
You saw what happened yesterday.

23:13.376 --> 23:15.177
Well, maybe it's something else.

23:15.245 --> 23:17.379
Like what?

23:20.417 --> 23:23.919
Me?! Okay, you think that
this is my fault?

23:23.986 --> 23:27.122
Well, I know how badly
you always want to win.

23:27.190 --> 23:29.592
Sometimes a horse can feel
the rider's anxiety.

23:29.659 --> 23:31.492
Just quit trying to cover up
for Amy

23:31.560 --> 23:34.262
and admit that
she can't fix him.

23:34.330 --> 23:36.797
You know what? I have an idea.

23:36.865 --> 23:39.334
I'll jump him and show you there
is nothing wrong with your horse.

23:43.639 --> 23:46.073
- Hey. I got a bone to pick with you.
- Oh good.

23:46.141 --> 23:48.543
I stupidly took your advice
and talked to Casey

23:48.611 --> 23:49.976
and now it's got her thinking.

23:50.044 --> 23:52.279
Oh, so she does wanna move
into Big River?

23:52.347 --> 23:55.515
Worse. She's out looking at
an acreage that's up for sale.

23:55.583 --> 23:57.217
It's not exactly a castle,

23:57.285 --> 23:58.585
but I don't think
she can afford it,

23:58.653 --> 24:00.587
so obviously she's gonna wanna
go in on it together.

24:00.655 --> 24:02.689
Well, would that be
the worst thing in the world?

24:02.757 --> 24:04.891
Things are going pretty well
with you two, right? Yeah.

24:04.959 --> 24:06.393
Right. Yeah, I wanna keep it
that way.

24:06.461 --> 24:08.629
- I see, you're scared.
- I'm not scared.

24:08.696 --> 24:10.730
Hey, I'm not judging. I get it.

24:10.797 --> 24:13.098
You haven't lived with a woman
since Marion.

24:13.166 --> 24:14.467
Not true, exactly.

24:14.534 --> 24:16.769
There was a barrel racer
named Linda

24:16.836 --> 24:18.471
- I shacked up with for a couple of weeks.
- I don't need to hear this.

24:18.538 --> 24:20.473
And a waitress I met at
a greasy spoon named Sarah.

24:20.540 --> 24:22.229
- Tim, I'm not interested.
- That lasted two months.

24:22.295 --> 24:24.343
And Miranda, we made it an entire
year in that seedy apartment.

24:24.411 --> 24:26.379
Until we fought so bad
they had to kick us out.

24:26.446 --> 24:28.814
You were a mess back then.

24:28.882 --> 24:30.382
You can't compare any of that
to what you have with Casey.

24:30.449 --> 24:33.652
That's right. Jack, this time
I got something to lose.

24:33.719 --> 24:36.955
If we do this,
we move in together...

24:37.023 --> 24:39.291
what happens when she sees me
for who I really am?

24:39.358 --> 24:42.227
- And who would that be?
- I don't know.

24:42.295 --> 24:45.397
I-I know that I don't have a very good
track record for this kind of thing.

24:45.464 --> 24:47.232
The past is the past.

24:47.300 --> 24:48.667
You're a different person
then the guy

24:48.734 --> 24:52.170
that Marion or Miranda
had to live with.

24:52.237 --> 24:53.705
I could do this.

24:55.541 --> 24:57.742
You know, face it,
I'm getting older.

24:57.810 --> 24:59.311
I don't wanna be alone.

24:59.378 --> 25:01.979
I love her.

25:02.047 --> 25:03.415
Maybe it's time.

25:07.586 --> 25:10.087
What the hell...
I'm gonna do it.

25:13.125 --> 25:14.725
Be careful.

25:14.793 --> 25:16.660
We'll be fine.

25:36.080 --> 25:37.681
- Whoa!
- Rein him in!

25:37.749 --> 25:39.650
Whoa, boy!

25:39.718 --> 25:41.752
Georgie!

25:45.289 --> 25:48.057
Oh my God! Amy, do something!
He's bleeding!

25:48.124 --> 25:50.292
What is going on here?

25:50.361 --> 25:51.994
She said that she could jump him.
She said I was the problem.

25:52.062 --> 25:56.332
- This is all Georgie's fault!
- I am so sorry!

25:56.400 --> 25:59.101
I've gotta get him to the clinic.

25:59.169 --> 26:01.337
Come on, Bud.

26:09.512 --> 26:12.181
See, I'd heard how dangerous
the Banzai Pipeline is,

26:12.249 --> 26:14.350
but you have no idea until
you're actually surfing it.

26:14.417 --> 26:16.352
I mean, th-this swell
came out of nowhere

26:16.419 --> 26:17.987
and doubled up over
the inside section...

26:18.054 --> 26:21.123
- Really.
- It chewed me up and spit me out.

26:21.191 --> 26:24.393
Left me for dead. Uh, that
sounds like a good time.

26:24.460 --> 26:27.604
It was... complete zen.

26:28.030 --> 26:32.000
Being at nature's mercy,
giving up all control...

26:32.067 --> 26:33.968
What's wrong with control?
I mean, I...

26:34.036 --> 26:37.438
I feel like I haven't had enough
of that in my life lately.

26:37.506 --> 26:39.440
Well, sometimes the only way
to get it back

26:39.508 --> 26:41.742
is to let it go altogether.

26:43.312 --> 26:45.280
I have no idea
what that means...

26:45.347 --> 26:47.581
and I kinda doubt you do either.

26:47.649 --> 26:50.919
You have a cool vibe, Louise.

26:50.986 --> 26:54.088
You challenge me.
I like that about you.

26:54.156 --> 26:58.659
Can I see you again tomorrow,
for dinner, right here?

26:58.727 --> 27:02.296
Uh... I'm about as ready
to go on a real date

27:02.363 --> 27:04.632
as I am to surf a tidal wave
right now.

27:04.699 --> 27:08.669
So thank you for this,
you're a real interesting guy.

27:08.737 --> 27:14.341
But I should... I should get going.

27:14.409 --> 27:16.610
Back to your safe
little bubble, huh?

27:25.186 --> 27:27.587
- Is he okay?
- Yeah.

27:27.655 --> 27:30.723
Scott gave him a tetanus shot and
says it should heal up on its own.

27:32.460 --> 27:34.828
Where is Budget Buster?

27:34.895 --> 27:37.030
He's still at the clinic.
Scott's running some test

27:37.098 --> 27:41.301
to see if there's something
that's affecting his jumping.

27:41.369 --> 27:43.036
Georgie, what were you thinking?

27:43.104 --> 27:45.638
Well, you said the problem
could be Olivia,

27:45.706 --> 27:47.307
so I wanted to show her there was
nothing wrong with her horse.

27:47.375 --> 27:49.042
That was just my first
thought, okay?

27:49.110 --> 27:51.010
I was still working through
other possibilities.

27:51.078 --> 27:54.647
I told you that I wanted to have him
checked out before I jumped him.

27:59.932 --> 28:04.669
Georgie, I know you're sorry.
But I want to understand

28:04.774 --> 28:07.259
what possessed you to do
something so thoughtless.

28:07.327 --> 28:09.228
Like what you're doing
with Bear?

28:09.296 --> 28:11.197
What're you talking about?

28:11.264 --> 28:14.166
You have no idea how this is
going to affect him and Buddy.

28:14.234 --> 28:17.013
It's not fair, Amy.

28:36.645 --> 28:38.891
Amy told me about Bear.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.394
It sounds like a pretty cool
new life.

28:41.461 --> 28:44.163
But what about him
leaving Buddy? Leaving me?

28:44.231 --> 28:46.365
It's gonna be tough at first.

28:46.433 --> 28:48.333
But they're both gonna have
good homes

28:48.401 --> 28:50.168
where they're needed.

28:50.236 --> 28:53.104
And who know? Maybe they'll bring
Bear back to visit us sometime.

28:53.172 --> 28:56.341
Yeah, right. Like how Stephen's gonna
come visit me every chance he gets.

28:56.409 --> 28:57.609
It's not gonna happen.

28:57.677 --> 28:59.945
What're you talking about?

29:01.828 --> 29:05.050
He's moving away
to Manitoba. For good.

29:08.596 --> 29:10.589
Here I was all nervous about...

29:10.657 --> 29:13.491
what it means to have a boyfriend.

29:15.428 --> 29:17.062
Stephen is your boyfriend?

29:17.129 --> 29:19.631
Well, obviously not now.

29:19.699 --> 29:21.299
We can't even be friends anymore.

29:21.367 --> 29:23.201
It's not like I have many of those.

29:23.269 --> 29:26.804
Hey... Look, I'm sorry, Georgie.

29:26.872 --> 29:29.740
And I know it feels like it's the
end of the world right now, but...

29:29.808 --> 29:31.543
Can you please just...

29:31.610 --> 29:34.379
Can you not try to put
some positive spin on this?

29:34.447 --> 29:37.949
Because I'm not in the mood
right now, okay?

29:46.092 --> 29:50.027
- Hey! Do you want some scrambled eggs?
- I'm not hungry.

29:50.096 --> 29:53.530
- Everything okay with her?
- No, she's upset about Bear...

29:53.599 --> 29:55.600
and her friend Stephen.

29:55.667 --> 29:57.401
Is that the boy that came by
and spent time with her

29:57.469 --> 29:58.803
when she had chicken pox?

29:58.870 --> 30:01.005
Yeah. They went on their
first date yesterday.

30:01.125 --> 30:02.563
She went on a date?

30:02.642 --> 30:05.009
Don't worry, Grandpa, it was also her last.

30:05.077 --> 30:06.410
He's moving away.

30:06.478 --> 30:09.146
Oh... Oh, that's heartbreaking.

30:10.715 --> 30:13.674
So I hope you had a little
more luck than that

30:13.688 --> 30:15.911
on your date yesterday.

30:16.030 --> 30:19.328
You went on a date?

30:20.911 --> 30:23.943
Hello. Yes, this is she.

30:24.286 --> 30:27.764
Oh, yeah, thank you
for getting back to me.

30:27.832 --> 30:29.075
Uh... what?!

30:29.128 --> 30:32.335
No, no. There must be
some mistake.

30:33.805 --> 30:36.474
And... yes. No, please do
send me that report.

30:36.542 --> 30:38.610
Thank you.

30:38.677 --> 30:40.878
That vindictive, lying little...

30:40.946 --> 30:42.547
Who? What?

30:42.615 --> 30:44.382
That was the insurance company.

30:44.450 --> 30:45.916
They got Carson's report

30:45.984 --> 30:48.601
and the loft failed his
inspection.

30:54.643 --> 30:57.093
This is all because I turned
down a second date with Carson.

30:57.159 --> 30:59.111
- Who is Carson?
- He's the insurance inspector,

30:59.164 --> 31:01.051
- and it wasn't a date...
- You said it was a date.

31:01.117 --> 31:03.752
It was coffee. And when
I turned down a real date

31:03.820 --> 31:05.486
he went and filed a bogus report.

31:05.554 --> 31:08.290
- Is that even possible?
- He's saying the loft isn't up to code...

31:08.357 --> 31:11.626
Not up to code?!
We did everything by the book!

31:11.693 --> 31:14.229
Grandpa, of course you did. We're not
gonna let him get away with this.

31:14.297 --> 31:15.953
Yeah, I think you should
reconsider that date.

31:16.465 --> 31:18.033
- What?
- And I'll be going with you too.

31:18.100 --> 31:19.600
I'll be having a little "chat"
with him

31:19.668 --> 31:21.169
about his so-called issues.

31:21.237 --> 31:22.737
Yeah, I-I don't think
that's the best idea.

31:22.805 --> 31:25.373
No, Lisa's right.
I'm doing this on my own.

31:25.441 --> 31:28.708
- Why don't you just call him?
- No. I'm gonna do this face-to-face.

31:28.776 --> 31:30.610
Because we're gonna see
how zen he is

31:30.678 --> 31:32.599
when I get through with him.

31:47.962 --> 31:49.353
Are you still mad at me?

31:51.999 --> 31:54.501
Of course not. Why would I be mad at you?
People leave all the time.

31:54.569 --> 31:56.269
You haven't spoken to me
since our ride.

31:56.337 --> 31:59.973
Okay, well, maybe I was
little ticked off.

32:00.040 --> 32:01.274
Look, I get it, you need to go,

32:01.342 --> 32:03.109
but it doesn't mean I have
to like it.

32:03.177 --> 32:05.211
I don't really like it either.

32:05.279 --> 32:07.613
I mean, Manitoba doesn't
have mountains,

32:07.681 --> 32:10.783
or those shakes at Maggie's.

32:12.052 --> 32:15.054
And it doesn't have you.

32:15.122 --> 32:17.723
I felt kinda lonely this summer.

32:18.961 --> 32:20.159
Yeah. Me too.

32:20.227 --> 32:22.628
But we can still
keep in touch over email

32:22.696 --> 32:25.164
and... Facetime and stuff, right?

32:31.204 --> 32:33.171
Well, you haven't left yet.

32:33.239 --> 32:35.507
Here, take a brush.

32:49.388 --> 32:51.723
I am so stoked you decided
to change your mind.

32:51.790 --> 32:55.226
Yeah, well, don't get
too "stoked" there, dude.

32:55.293 --> 32:57.562
- What's up, Louise?
- It's Lou, okay?

32:57.630 --> 32:59.797
O-kay. Why am I getting
a hostile vibe right...

32:59.865 --> 33:01.165
Look, I know you failed the loft,

33:01.233 --> 33:04.002
and it's all because
I turned you down.

33:04.069 --> 33:05.970
What? No, I was just doing
my job...

33:06.038 --> 33:08.721
That is B.S. and you know it!

33:09.908 --> 33:11.575
Maybe we should talk
about this outside...

33:11.643 --> 33:13.644
No, no, no. This is how you
handle rejection?

33:13.711 --> 33:15.311
It's pathetic, okay?

33:15.379 --> 33:18.549
Because my dad and my grandpa
take great pride in their work,

33:18.616 --> 33:20.951
and everything in that loft
was done to code.

33:21.019 --> 33:23.887
- Uh... no, it actually wasn't.
- Right.

33:23.955 --> 33:26.757
See, they tied the new wiring in the
existing electrical on the east wall.

33:26.824 --> 33:29.892
Don't try to snow me
with technical jargon, okay?

33:29.960 --> 33:31.327
It's really not that technical.

33:31.395 --> 33:32.929
You just need to install
a new breaker box.

33:32.996 --> 33:35.265
Oh, and a handrail
for the stairs.

33:35.332 --> 33:38.368
So, what? You're just trying
to tie us up in red tape now?

33:38.436 --> 33:39.569
No. Not at all.

33:39.636 --> 33:42.205
Do the upgrades and you pass.
It's no big deal.

33:42.273 --> 33:44.163
In fact, it happens all the time.

33:45.543 --> 33:47.422
- Oh.
- Yeah.

33:49.150 --> 33:52.882
Wow. So you really thought
that I would risk my job

33:52.950 --> 33:54.850
because you wouldn't go
out with me?

33:54.918 --> 33:58.854
- Uh... I...
- Wow... Okay.

34:00.086 --> 34:02.458
I guess the ego has landed.

34:03.608 --> 34:06.161
I think I'm uh... I'm gonna go.

34:06.229 --> 34:08.397
Okay.

34:08.465 --> 34:11.866
You have a nice life... Lou.

34:15.737 --> 34:17.572
Okay...

34:18.873 --> 34:20.041
Hi.

34:25.947 --> 34:27.648
Hey.

34:27.716 --> 34:29.315
I just heard from Scott.

34:29.384 --> 34:32.319
It turns out Budget Buster has
something called "kissing spines."

34:32.387 --> 34:34.321
It's probably not as cute
as it sounds.

34:34.389 --> 34:36.824
No. It's when a horse's vertebrae
start pinching together.

34:36.891 --> 34:38.853
And that's what's happening
when he's jumping.

34:38.907 --> 34:40.860
It's incredibly painful.

34:40.929 --> 34:42.389
Well, can we fix it?

34:42.534 --> 34:43.898
Scott's gonna perform surgery.

34:43.965 --> 34:45.433
Well, that doesn't sound good.

34:45.500 --> 34:49.702
Actually, almost all
the jumpers recover 100%.

34:49.770 --> 34:52.414
So I didn't... make it worse?

34:52.598 --> 34:55.675
No. I think he's gonna be fine.

34:56.266 --> 34:59.012
I'm so sorry I jumped him.
I wasn't thinking straight.

34:59.080 --> 35:00.280
I'm still not.

35:00.348 --> 35:03.283
I just hate seeing Bear
and Buddy be torn apart.

35:03.351 --> 35:05.852
Bear led us to Buddy.
He saved his life.

35:05.920 --> 35:09.963
Yeah, and that's why he's
gonna make a great police horse.

35:10.200 --> 35:11.825
It's in his DNA.

35:11.892 --> 35:13.760
Bear was meant for greater things

35:13.828 --> 35:17.029
and deep down you know
that's true.

35:19.099 --> 35:22.234
I'm sorry about Stephen.
I heard you guys talking.

35:22.302 --> 35:24.737
I can't imagine going
to school without him.

35:24.805 --> 35:27.406
Who am I going to sit with
on the bus? Or at lunch?

35:27.475 --> 35:29.542
Or make fun of our teachers with?

35:29.610 --> 35:32.912
I was a lot like you.
I never hung out in big crowds,

35:32.980 --> 35:35.582
I only ever had one best friend.

35:35.649 --> 35:39.318
But maybe this will...
I don't know...

35:39.386 --> 35:41.820
force you to let new people in?

35:42.991 --> 35:45.788
How does that saying go?
When one door closes...

35:45.867 --> 35:49.099
You're totally left all alone
on the other side.

35:49.416 --> 35:51.763
Funny, that's not
quite how I remember it.

35:58.405 --> 36:00.072
You in here?

36:00.646 --> 36:02.174
Case?

36:07.597 --> 36:09.471
Well, well, well...

36:09.537 --> 36:11.806
What have we got here?

36:13.402 --> 36:16.674
Let's do it. Let's move in together.

36:19.346 --> 36:21.589
Tim, I don't know
what to say.

36:21.879 --> 36:23.794
I just put an offer in
on that ranch.

36:23.862 --> 36:25.796
What? I haven't even seen it?

36:25.864 --> 36:27.197
Yeah, but there were other
people interested, you know?

36:27.265 --> 36:28.699
I had to move fast.

36:28.767 --> 36:32.369
Right. And I trust
your judgment.

36:32.437 --> 36:36.031
So you know I'm gonna have to sell
Big River to put in my share.

36:39.645 --> 36:43.313
Um... I don't think
you understand

36:43.381 --> 36:46.883
what I'm trying to say.

36:46.951 --> 36:49.883
I wanna buy this place
on my own...

36:51.488 --> 36:52.923
It'll be the first real home
I've had

36:52.990 --> 36:54.857
since Hank passed away.

36:55.358 --> 36:57.427
Something that's all mine...

36:58.245 --> 37:00.864
and I'm ready for that
right now.

37:00.932 --> 37:04.630
Yeah. I-I thought...

37:05.302 --> 37:07.103
And I don't want things
to change between us.

37:07.171 --> 37:08.637
I mean, I love the way
things are now.

37:08.705 --> 37:10.105
Yeah, me too.

37:13.610 --> 37:17.131
- So you're okay with this?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

37:18.615 --> 37:20.082
Actually, I'm kind of relieved
'cause I thought

37:20.149 --> 37:22.017
I might have to give up
my bachelor lifestyle.

37:24.921 --> 37:27.656
- I love you.
- I love you too.

37:39.242 --> 37:41.043
It's sucks to see these guys
hanging out

37:41.110 --> 37:43.219
like it's just another day.

37:43.947 --> 37:45.915
They have no idea
what's gonna happen.

37:45.982 --> 37:48.074
It's gonna be okay.

37:48.681 --> 37:50.719
- Did you know they were coming?
- No.

37:57.427 --> 37:59.761
Hey, guys. Is everything all right?

37:59.828 --> 38:01.396
Yeah, we just wanted
to swing by

38:01.464 --> 38:03.365
and say thanks.

38:03.433 --> 38:06.401
For getting Budget Buster
properly diagnosed.

38:06.469 --> 38:08.970
I just hope that nasty gash
doesn't leave a scar.

38:09.038 --> 38:10.572
Scott thinks it'll heal just fine.

38:10.639 --> 38:12.901
I guess we'll just have to see.

38:13.772 --> 38:15.976
Oh, uh... sorry.

38:17.245 --> 38:19.580
Hello. Yes, this is she.

38:21.703 --> 38:23.917
Are you still mad at me?

38:23.985 --> 38:26.967
I'm just glad that my horse
is gonna be okay.

38:28.290 --> 38:31.201
I guess your mom's
pretty mad at me.

38:31.478 --> 38:34.961
No. She's just upset 'cause
this big job fell through.

38:35.028 --> 38:36.762
I swear she was on her phone
for a week

38:36.830 --> 38:38.864
trying to seal the deal.

38:38.932 --> 38:40.400
Sorry to hear about that.

38:40.468 --> 38:42.368
Are you kidding? We were gonna
have to move to Toronto.

38:42.436 --> 38:46.038
- I'm so glad we're not going.
- Me too.

38:46.107 --> 38:47.907
What? Really?

38:47.975 --> 38:53.213
Well, for your sake. I know
it's not easy moving away.

38:53.280 --> 38:56.116
Well, I should go.

39:00.286 --> 39:03.623
Hey. A bunch of girls
from my riding club

39:03.690 --> 39:06.222
are gonna go hang out
at Maggie's later.

39:06.617 --> 39:09.529
It's like no big deal,
but you could come too.

39:10.189 --> 39:12.865
Uh, yeah, maybe.

39:14.688 --> 39:17.769
- See? Other doors.
- Shut up.

39:20.836 --> 39:24.676
I can't believe you
didn't install a separate breaker box.

39:24.744 --> 39:26.411
- You could've said something...
- I'm not the one

39:26.479 --> 39:28.614
that claims to be some kind
of expert on wiring.

39:28.681 --> 39:31.583
"It's all to code." How many times
did I have to listen to that?

39:31.651 --> 39:33.218
If you're gonna keep on me
about this

39:33.286 --> 39:35.119
you can install the damn thing
yourself.

39:35.187 --> 39:37.555
Uh... what was that about?

39:37.623 --> 39:40.324
We have to make a couple
of minor additions to the loft

39:40.392 --> 39:41.925
to get it up to code.

39:41.993 --> 39:43.628
- We didn't pass inspection?
- Nope.

39:43.695 --> 39:46.631
Oh, Lou, even after you went
to coffee with the guy?

39:46.698 --> 39:49.033
It turns out Dad and Grandpa
actually forgot a couple of things.

39:49.100 --> 39:51.235
- Are you serious?
- It's going to be fine.

39:51.303 --> 39:53.137
I just... wish I'd known that

39:53.205 --> 39:54.938
before I went in there
guns a blazing.

39:55.006 --> 39:56.707
What do you mean?

39:56.775 --> 39:59.977
I kinda called out Carson
on filing a bogus report

40:00.045 --> 40:01.211
after I turned down a date
with him.

40:01.279 --> 40:03.213
- Oh no...
- Oh yeah.

40:03.281 --> 40:06.083
At Maggie's, and I wasn't
quiet about it.

40:06.151 --> 40:08.018
I came off looking like
a ranting,

40:08.086 --> 40:11.488
- self-absorbed crazy lady.
- Mmhmm.

40:11.556 --> 40:15.125
It wasn't funny,
it was mortifying.

40:15.193 --> 40:17.360
But one good thing came out
of all of this.

40:17.428 --> 40:19.296
I am now certain,
beyond a shadow of a doubt,

40:19.363 --> 40:21.763
that I am not ready to date.

40:26.370 --> 40:27.870
Hey.

40:27.938 --> 40:30.240
You are gonna do great, Bear.

40:30.308 --> 40:31.774
I know you are.

40:31.842 --> 40:33.076
Yeah.

40:36.214 --> 40:37.971
Hi, baby.

40:41.018 --> 40:43.286
Bye, Bear. Bye...

40:43.854 --> 40:46.988
I'm gonna miss you.

40:50.893 --> 40:53.662
We'll give him a good home,
I promise.

40:56.508 --> 40:58.467
Come on.

41:21.929 --> 41:23.670
Thanks.

41:48.548 --> 41:50.215
Whoa, Buddy. Hey! Whoa...

41:51.818 --> 41:54.520
No, I got this!

42:14.707 --> 42:16.775
Wait! Please stop!

42:23.815 --> 42:25.081
Everything okay?

42:25.149 --> 42:28.919
- They need to say goodbye.
- Sure.

42:42.098 --> 42:45.535
Okay, Buddy. Bear's gotta go now.

42:45.602 --> 42:47.269
Thank you.

43:04.019 --> 43:06.287
Bear's gonna be okay.

43:06.356 --> 43:08.156
So are you.

43:08.224 --> 43:09.591
We're all gonna be okay.
