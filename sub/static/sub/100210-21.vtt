00:00.023 --> 00:03.195
<i>Back in the '80s, it was
always me and Barry Goldberg.</i>

00:03.344 --> 00:05.478
<i>But then the '90s hit, and we grew up.</i>

00:05.540 --> 00:07.203
<i>I was teaching at William Penn.</i>

00:07.305 --> 00:09.242
<i>Barry was doing
his residency in Detroit.</i>

00:09.267 --> 00:10.278
Barry? Barry?

00:10.303 --> 00:11.369
<i>For over a year,</i>

00:11.438 --> 00:12.837
<i>we tried to make it work long-distance.</i>

00:12.906 --> 00:15.440
<i>We talked and talked... a lot.</i>

00:15.509 --> 00:17.976
<i>And what we finally decided
was best was to break up...</i>

00:18.044 --> 00:20.512
<i>maybe not forever,
but definitely for now.</i>

00:20.614 --> 00:22.013
<i>Of course I was a mess.</i>

00:22.082 --> 00:24.449
<i>But I finally got myself up and out.</i>

00:24.518 --> 00:27.185
<i>And fortunately, the best
of all the '90s rom-coms,</i>

00:27.287 --> 00:29.254
<i>"Clueless," had just hit the theaters.</i>

00:29.322 --> 00:30.789
I love Josh.

00:30.891 --> 00:32.122
<i>And I found inspirations</i>

00:32.192 --> 00:34.692
<i>from the bold,
charming intelligence of Cher.</i>

00:34.761 --> 00:36.661
<i>Her sense of independence
made me feel like</i>

00:36.730 --> 00:38.496
<i>I could make it on my own.</i>

00:38.565 --> 00:40.365
<i>So I decided to be just like her,</i>

00:40.467 --> 00:42.552
<i>including the cute outfits.</i>

00:42.598 --> 00:43.612
<i>Believe it or not,</i>

00:43.637 --> 00:45.403
<i>my breakup with Barry
wasn't getting me down.</i>

00:45.472 --> 00:47.338
<i>The two of us had decided
to go our separate ways</i>

00:47.441 --> 00:48.873
<i>and remain friends, so I was ready</i>

00:48.975 --> 00:51.509
<i>to move on with my life
and put Barry in the past.</i>

00:51.578 --> 00:52.911
Let's talk about you and Barry.

00:52.979 --> 00:55.046
I can't believe Barry left you
for one of his nurses

00:55.115 --> 00:57.449
and ran off to Toronto,
the Paris of Canada.

00:57.551 --> 00:58.850
It was totally mutual.

00:58.952 --> 01:01.052
And at the very least, Montreal
is the Paris of Canada.

01:01.121 --> 01:02.487
That's not what I heard went down.

01:02.556 --> 01:05.890
Word is, Goldberg stuck a note
in her Build-a-Bear.

01:05.959 --> 01:07.926
Using America's cuddliest mall novelty

01:07.994 --> 01:09.060
to do his dirty work.

01:09.129 --> 01:10.228
Makes me sick.

01:10.297 --> 01:12.697
Leave her alone!
She's a grown woman. She's fine.

01:12.799 --> 01:14.566
Are you fine?
I can make you a pie, sweetie.

01:14.634 --> 01:16.401
Guys, take it from me...
who was actually there...

01:16.470 --> 01:17.702
it was a totally normal break-up.

01:17.771 --> 01:19.137
Now, can we please move on with our day?

01:19.239 --> 01:20.472
Aw, Lainey, there you are.

01:20.540 --> 01:22.674
CB and Wilma need a third
for the prom committee,

01:22.742 --> 01:24.742
and I thought, who better
than you to help them out?

01:24.811 --> 01:26.010
I'd be happy to.

01:26.079 --> 01:28.079
Thank you for treating me
like a fully functioning person.

01:28.148 --> 01:30.682
Anything to take your mind
off of the brutal breakup.

01:30.750 --> 01:32.550
And to think Barry crushed your heart

01:32.652 --> 01:34.385
on a beautiful hot-air balloon ride

01:34.488 --> 01:35.987
over the vineyards of Napa.

01:36.056 --> 01:38.056
For the last time...

01:38.158 --> 01:40.124
Oh. I actually like that one.
We'll go with that.

01:40.193 --> 01:43.461
And we, your friends on
the ground, are here for you.

01:43.563 --> 01:44.629
Group hug, everyone.

01:44.731 --> 01:46.831
Oh. No.

01:46.933 --> 01:49.701
<i>♪ One of these days,
you're gonna get outta here ♪</i>

01:49.803 --> 01:52.670
<i>♪ Live your life and finally be free ♪</i>

01:52.772 --> 01:55.640
<i>♪ Go where you wanna go,

01:55.742 --> 01:59.410
<i>♪ Someday, you will say
"Those were the days" ♪</i>

01:59.513 --> 02:02.780
<i>It was May 13, 1990-something,
and Julie had gone out of town</i>

02:02.883 --> 02:05.350
<i>and entrusted Coach Mellor to
be totally in charge of Toby.</i>

02:05.452 --> 02:06.618
Hey, John. Look at Toby.

02:06.720 --> 02:07.819
That's my boy.

02:07.921 --> 02:10.354
Well, not my boy,
but my girlfriend's boy.

02:10.457 --> 02:11.923
Well, actually, uh, her nephew

02:12.025 --> 02:13.558
who she's the legal guardian of.

02:13.660 --> 02:16.127
You meant "of whom
she is the legal guardian."

02:16.229 --> 02:17.562
Don't be that guy, John.

02:17.664 --> 02:19.864
The point is, Julie's only
been gone for a couple days,

02:19.966 --> 02:22.467
and already, my alpha energy
is rubbing off on Toby.

02:22.569 --> 02:24.769
And the ladies are clearly drawn to it.

02:24.871 --> 02:26.371
Actually, Rick, that's Dawn,

02:26.473 --> 02:28.439
the senior girl who's tutoring Toby.

02:28.542 --> 02:31.276
She's part of my program
where seniors tutor freshmen.

02:31.378 --> 02:33.378
Oh, yeah, your, uh, "See-Fresh" program.

02:33.480 --> 02:36.014
Yes, "See-Fresh" is
an extremely clever name

02:36.116 --> 02:39.217
that I came up with
and not a typo that... happened

02:39.319 --> 02:40.885
while I was designing the flyers.

02:40.987 --> 02:42.387
I think he's got a crush on Dawn.

02:42.489 --> 02:43.788
I remember my first crush...

02:43.890 --> 02:46.357
1964, Ursulga Bordath.

02:46.459 --> 02:48.560
She was an Olympic shot-putter,
won a gold medal.

02:48.662 --> 02:51.262
When she put that shot, it may
as well have been my heart.

02:51.364 --> 02:53.131
I was a Mrs. Butterworth guy myself.

02:53.233 --> 02:54.332
Sweet and shapely.

02:54.434 --> 02:56.301
Maybe it's best
we don't tell anybody else

02:56.403 --> 02:57.969
what we've shared here today.

02:58.071 --> 02:59.804
Yeah. That may be best.

02:59.906 --> 03:01.272
Anyways, I'm gonna head out.

03:01.374 --> 03:04.275
I... suddenly have
a hankering for pancakes.

03:06.279 --> 03:08.478
Hey, Coach! You'll never guess
what just happened!

03:08.556 --> 03:10.381
- What happened?
- Dawn asked me to go to prom with her.

03:10.483 --> 03:11.859
Oh, ha ha!

03:11.921 --> 03:13.685
That sounds great, buddy! Congrats!

03:13.787 --> 03:14.886
This is so cool.

03:14.988 --> 03:17.155
I never thought
I'd start dating till I was 35,

03:17.257 --> 03:18.656
but I'm a playa now.

03:18.758 --> 03:20.325
It's on like Donkey Kong!

03:20.427 --> 03:21.793
You're going to prom, baby!

03:21.895 --> 03:22.694
Oh, yeah!

03:23.897 --> 03:26.431
Toby, a bunch of us
are going to play laser tag

03:26.533 --> 03:27.699
on Saturday night.

03:27.801 --> 03:29.233
I was thinking maybe you could come.

03:29.336 --> 03:30.668
Laser tag? Yeah.

03:30.770 --> 03:31.869
That's a game for boys.

03:31.972 --> 03:33.771
And as of today, I'm a man now.

03:33.873 --> 03:35.573
Dawn just asked me
to go to prom with her.

03:35.675 --> 03:37.976
Isn't Dawn, like... old?

03:38.078 --> 03:39.277
Yep. 17.

03:39.379 --> 03:40.445
And in one more year,

03:40.547 --> 03:42.380
she'll be able to get us
into R-rated movies.

03:42.482 --> 03:45.416
Okay. Well, have fun at prom, I guess.

03:45.518 --> 03:47.752
<i>Toby couldn't contain
his excitement for prom.</i>

03:47.854 --> 03:49.287
<i>Meanwhile, Wilma and CB realized</i>

03:49.389 --> 03:51.489
<i>they'd need to get creative
with their prom plans.</i>

03:51.558 --> 03:54.792
Okay, for prom decorations,
all I was able to dig out of storage

03:54.894 --> 03:56.728
were some old Halloween streamers

03:56.830 --> 03:58.763
and a "Dukakis for President" banner.

03:58.832 --> 04:01.165
So, how are you doing with
all this Lainey and Barry stuff?

04:01.267 --> 04:02.333
It must be weird for you,

04:02.402 --> 04:04.969
seeing as how you were
pining after Lainey forever,

04:05.038 --> 04:07.472
and as soon as you start
dating Paloma... boom.

04:07.540 --> 04:09.607
Miss Lainey suddenly is
back on the market.

04:09.709 --> 04:12.043
Wilma, like the failed
presidential campaign

04:12.112 --> 04:14.512
of Michael Dukakis,
that stuff's in the past.

04:14.581 --> 04:17.048
So, are you telling me you have
no feelings for Lainey?

04:17.149 --> 04:18.616
I am happy with Paloma now.

04:18.685 --> 04:21.252
Okay, you know what?
Just let it go, please.

04:22.222 --> 04:23.454
You didn't say no.

04:23.523 --> 04:25.456
Okay, so, what are we doing here?

04:25.558 --> 04:26.824
I present to you...

04:26.926 --> 04:29.093
our blank prom canvas,

04:29.162 --> 04:31.496
A.K.A. the stinky-ass gym.

04:31.564 --> 04:33.164
We could probably build off
the dank smell

04:33.233 --> 04:35.099
and go with an "Under the Sea
at Low Tide" theme.

04:35.168 --> 04:36.901
You know, Paloma, my new girlfriend,

04:36.970 --> 04:39.070
spent the entire summer under the sea

04:39.172 --> 04:41.406
studying whale migration patterns, so...

04:41.474 --> 04:43.041
Oh. I'm... I'm sorry.

04:43.143 --> 04:44.909
I didn't mean
to rub my happy relationship

04:45.011 --> 04:46.144
in your sad face.

04:46.212 --> 04:48.108
It's okay. I'm genuinely happy for you.

04:48.178 --> 04:49.452
Talk about Paloma all you want.

04:49.530 --> 04:51.849
Okay. Thank God. 'Cause literally
everything reminds me of her.

04:51.918 --> 04:52.850
She's just the best.

04:52.919 --> 04:54.352
I can't even remember life "BP."

04:54.421 --> 04:56.621
That means "Before Paloma."

04:56.690 --> 04:58.222
My new "GF." That means "girl..."

04:58.291 --> 04:59.924
We know. Okay, uh, prom themes.

05:00.026 --> 05:02.760
We need something long
to cover all this space.

05:02.862 --> 05:04.796
I got it... "Slip 'N Slide of Love."

05:04.864 --> 05:06.798
I've got an older one
I'd be okay to lend out.

05:06.866 --> 05:08.633
How about something like
"Tunnel of Love"?

05:08.702 --> 05:11.536
Which is more normal and will have
less personal-injury lawsuits.

05:11.638 --> 05:13.671
Wait. I got it. And I really do got it.

05:13.740 --> 05:15.373
"Chunnel of Love."

05:15.442 --> 05:17.842
What the hell's a Chunnel?
Like a chubby tunnel?

05:17.911 --> 05:20.144
No, it's the recently completed
engineering marvel

05:20.246 --> 05:21.813
that connects England and France.

05:21.881 --> 05:24.649
Oh, uh, speaking of Paloma,
I'm gonna be late

05:24.751 --> 05:26.317
for our "afternoon delight."

05:26.386 --> 05:27.719
- Good Lord.
- What?

05:27.787 --> 05:29.020
Every afternoon, we meet up

05:29.089 --> 05:30.588
to get a delightful ice cream treat.

05:30.690 --> 05:31.989
Oh.

05:32.058 --> 05:34.692
It must be really hard
to see CB with a girlfriend,

05:34.761 --> 05:37.095
especially 'cause
if you and Barry had broken up

05:37.163 --> 05:39.597
like two weeks ago,
that girlfriend could be you.

05:39.699 --> 05:42.100
Oh, please. We all know he was into me.

05:42.202 --> 05:44.535
But as far as I'm concerned,
we're just good friends.

05:44.604 --> 05:45.603
Mm-hmm.

05:45.672 --> 05:46.904
Truth is, I'm happy to be single.

05:46.973 --> 05:48.673
I am free. I'm out there.

05:48.742 --> 05:50.708
I'm basically a Sheryl Crow song.

05:50.777 --> 05:52.410
Don't bring Sheryl Crow into this.

05:52.512 --> 05:55.079
<i>While I was trying to convince
Wilma that I was A-okay,</i>

05:55.148 --> 05:57.782
<i>Mellor was excited
to talk to Glascott A.S.A.P.</i>

05:57.851 --> 05:59.984
John, stop rolling. I got great news.

06:00.086 --> 06:02.186
You know how Toby has a crush
on Dawn Ferguson?

06:02.255 --> 06:03.855
Where's all this cat hair coming from?

06:03.957 --> 06:06.557
Well, get this... she just asked him...

06:06.659 --> 06:08.559
I haven't owned a cat in years.

06:08.661 --> 06:11.162
Dawn asked Toby to the prom.

06:11.264 --> 06:12.196
What?!

06:12.265 --> 06:14.132
A tutor asking out a tutee?

06:14.234 --> 06:16.467
That's against
the See-Fresh code of conduct.

06:16.536 --> 06:17.969
This is a learning program.

06:18.071 --> 06:19.637
It's not the "Swim-Up Happy Hour"

06:19.739 --> 06:21.706
at Sandals Montego Bay.

06:21.775 --> 06:23.641
Well, I guess
your little codes are no match

06:23.743 --> 06:26.244
for the testosterone-laden
tutelage of Rick Mellor.

06:26.312 --> 06:28.446
Do you think Toby is ready for prom?

06:28.548 --> 06:29.680
What's there to be ready for?

06:29.749 --> 06:32.416
Some respectfully spaced
slow dancing to Paul Anka?

06:32.485 --> 06:34.652
Fruit punch with enough 7-Up
to tickle your nose?

06:34.721 --> 06:36.154
Ending the night at the malt shop

06:36.256 --> 06:37.722
with an ice cream sundae for two?

06:37.791 --> 06:41.092
Rick, the Norman Rockwell world
you just described is long gone.

06:41.161 --> 06:43.628
These days, proms are like Studio 54.

06:43.730 --> 06:46.130
There are pre-parties and limo rides

06:46.199 --> 06:47.298
and after parties.

06:47.400 --> 06:49.333
And then there's a room
at the Embassy Suites.

06:49.402 --> 06:51.969
Well, Toby's not mature enough
for any of that.

06:52.038 --> 06:53.237
Just last week, he blushed

06:53.306 --> 06:55.106
when a chimp blew a kiss at him
at the zoo.

06:55.175 --> 06:56.507
Mm-hmm. Been there.

06:56.576 --> 06:57.975
Well, this can't happen on my watch.

06:58.044 --> 06:59.744
Julie left me with
her innocent little boy,

06:59.846 --> 07:02.113
and I can't let him
turn into a mini Don Johnson!

07:02.182 --> 07:04.015
Okay, let's not jump to conclusions.

07:04.117 --> 07:05.249
I'm sorry, Rick.

07:05.351 --> 07:07.718
Not only is there cat hair
on the outside of my sleeve,

07:07.821 --> 07:09.520
there's cat hair in my sleeve.

07:09.622 --> 07:11.222
How does a cat get in your sleeve?!

07:11.324 --> 07:13.457
<i>While Mellor was worried
if Toby was ready for prom,</i>

07:13.526 --> 07:15.860
<i>Wilma and I were readying the
school for the perfect night.</i>

07:15.929 --> 07:18.329
I hope when the kids ride
through our "Chunnel of Love,"

07:18.398 --> 07:20.665
it inspires them to learn
more about engineering.

07:20.733 --> 07:23.134
Ha. You know they're just gonna
use it for awkward teen groping.

07:23.236 --> 07:25.336
Anatomy. Still science. I'll take it.

07:25.363 --> 07:26.381
Oh, hey, guys.

07:26.406 --> 07:28.139
Oh, hey, Paloma, CB's new girlfriend.

07:28.241 --> 07:29.307
Have you seen him?

07:29.375 --> 07:31.142
No, he went to Panera
because we ran out of bread

07:31.211 --> 07:33.144
for our "Arc de Baguettes"
for the French side.

07:33.246 --> 07:35.780
Oh. Okay. Well, tell him I want to
talk to him. I have some big news.

07:35.849 --> 07:37.897
Ooh. Big news.
Did you buy a house? New car?

07:37.922 --> 07:38.975
You pregnant?

07:39.018 --> 07:40.918
- Only with information.
- Weird.

07:40.987 --> 07:43.287
- Okay. We'll let him know.
- It's really big news.

07:43.389 --> 07:44.722
We got that from when you said it.

07:44.791 --> 07:46.757
Sounds like you really want
to talk to someone about this.

07:46.860 --> 07:48.392
Yeah, we're all ears,
if you want to share.

07:48.417 --> 07:49.437
Okay.

07:49.462 --> 07:50.895
So, I have this amazing opportunity

07:50.997 --> 07:52.396
to go to the Brazilian rainforest

07:52.498 --> 07:54.475
to help protect endangered tree frogs.

07:54.500 --> 07:55.410
Wow.

07:55.435 --> 07:56.801
The only rainforest I've ever gone to

07:56.903 --> 07:58.102
is the Rainforest Cafe.

07:58.171 --> 07:59.604
Sounds like the chance of a lifetime.

07:59.706 --> 08:01.703
It is, but I'd be gone the whole summer.

08:01.758 --> 08:02.855
That's why I'm on the fence.

08:02.933 --> 08:05.576
Take it from someone who recently found
herself as an independent woman.

08:05.678 --> 08:07.044
You got to do what's best for you.

08:07.113 --> 08:08.246
But what about CB?

08:08.348 --> 08:09.780
You don't need to worry about CB.

08:09.883 --> 08:11.782
He's always telling me
how much he loves your passion.

08:11.885 --> 08:13.751
Talking about your passion
is his passion.

08:13.853 --> 08:15.086
You can't take that away from him.

08:15.188 --> 08:16.621
But you, of all people, know how hard

08:16.723 --> 08:18.021
the long-distance thing is.

08:18.068 --> 08:19.924
How long will you be long-distance for...
three months?

08:20.026 --> 08:21.525
I didn't think of it that way.

08:21.553 --> 08:22.593
Thanks, Lainey!

08:22.618 --> 08:24.161
I guess I'm going to the rainforest!

08:24.264 --> 08:26.097
Village with no plumbing, here I come.

08:26.199 --> 08:27.765
No plumbing? Ew!

08:27.867 --> 08:29.300
Eh... But go get 'em, tiger.

08:30.729 --> 08:31.769
Damn.

08:31.871 --> 08:33.136
That was some Erica Kane-level

08:33.239 --> 08:35.539
soap-opera stuff right there!

08:35.642 --> 08:37.107
Good God, woman! Let it go!

08:37.193 --> 08:39.610
I just told Paloma to spend the
summer living her frickin' dream.

08:39.712 --> 08:41.212
Until she gets bit by a mosquito

08:41.313 --> 08:43.648
or gets her face eaten off
by a rabid monkey.

08:43.750 --> 08:45.349
Then CB's all yours.

08:45.451 --> 08:46.589
That's insane!

08:46.653 --> 08:48.986
I just encouraged Paloma
to be an independent woman.

08:49.088 --> 08:50.667
An independent woman with no face.

08:54.656 --> 08:56.757
<i>Mellor was shocked to find out
about the pitfalls</i>

08:56.826 --> 08:58.990
<i>of modern proms, so he enlisted Glascott</i>

08:59.053 --> 09:00.756
<i>to find out just what was
in store for Toby.</i>

09:00.834 --> 09:03.155
What's happening, girls?
Excited for the prom?

09:03.257 --> 09:05.357
I know I'm pretty psyched
about the Chunnel of Love.

09:05.426 --> 09:06.692
Yeah, I-I guess.

09:06.761 --> 09:08.527
So, accessory wise,
what are you guys thinking...

09:08.596 --> 09:10.095
berets or Beefeater hats?

09:10.164 --> 09:12.464
Oh, we're probably not doing
anything Chunnel-related.

09:12.533 --> 09:14.460
Yeah, you don't wanna cover up
those great hairdos.

09:14.530 --> 09:15.568
So, what are you thinking?

09:15.636 --> 09:18.404
Uh, you wanna go with an updo
or half up, half down?

09:18.506 --> 09:19.738
Butterfly clips?

09:19.841 --> 09:21.373
Ooh! Spiky twists?

09:21.442 --> 09:23.175
Someone read the YM prom issue.

09:23.244 --> 09:25.477
You know I did, girlfriend.

09:25.546 --> 09:27.980
And, hey, is there
a post-prom party spot

09:28.049 --> 09:29.949
you guys plan on being all up in?

09:30.017 --> 09:31.083
Hey, John!

09:31.152 --> 09:33.118
You wanted me to talk
about mononucleosis

09:33.187 --> 09:35.120
and the toll it takes
on teens that kiss?

09:35.223 --> 09:37.022
Gosh, you kids don't want to catch that

09:37.124 --> 09:38.524
from your prom dates, do you?

09:38.593 --> 09:40.793
Don't worry. I won't be kissing
my prom date anytime soon.

09:40.895 --> 09:42.328
Really? Why's that?

09:42.396 --> 09:44.129
Oh. Nothing.

09:44.198 --> 09:46.899
Come on, Dawn!
Look, I am not your principal.

09:46.968 --> 09:49.668
Right now, I'm just another gal pal.

09:49.737 --> 09:51.170
Let's dish!

09:51.239 --> 09:53.239
Okay. I guess.

09:53.341 --> 09:54.607
Well, uh, my date to prom

09:54.675 --> 09:56.508
is this freshman kid,
and he's really sweet,

09:56.611 --> 09:58.844
but I'm just using him
as a cover because my parents...

09:58.913 --> 10:00.646
they don't like
my real boyfriend, Robbie.

10:00.715 --> 10:03.249
Robbie McFadden?
He's a budding delinquent.

10:03.317 --> 10:05.103
But when my parents see me
with this Toby kid,

10:05.166 --> 10:06.185
they'll let me go to prom,

10:06.254 --> 10:07.853
where I can just ditch him
and meet up with Robbie.

10:07.955 --> 10:09.655
So, you don't like Toby that way?

10:09.724 --> 10:10.689
Does he know that?

10:10.758 --> 10:12.625
Well, he's gotta. Right?

10:12.727 --> 10:14.193
I mean, he's, like, a little kid and...

10:14.295 --> 10:15.661
Well, let's just say that last week,

10:15.730 --> 10:17.429
somebody mistook me
for a real estate agent.

10:20.635 --> 10:21.667
If Toby goes to that prom,

10:21.736 --> 10:23.769
he's gonna have his little
squirrel heart broken.

10:23.838 --> 10:27.006
And if you tell him
and he doesn't go, still broken.

10:27.108 --> 10:29.541
Either option,
same squirrel heart result.

10:29.644 --> 10:31.377
Unless I can come up
with a third option.

10:31.445 --> 10:33.412
<i>While Mellor cooked up
an alternate plan,</i>

10:33.481 --> 10:36.015
<i>I was finding out
how I'd affected CB's plans.</i>

10:36.083 --> 10:37.683
Wilma wants a romantic shade of gray

10:37.785 --> 10:39.251
for the Chunnel walls,
so I've narrowed it down

10:39.320 --> 10:41.620
to "smoky charcoal"
or "Bea Arthur's hair."

10:41.689 --> 10:43.856
Wow. That's some serious
stress-juggling going on there.

10:43.958 --> 10:45.190
- You okay, pal?
- Not really.

10:45.259 --> 10:47.026
I feel like my heart
was ripped out of my body

10:47.128 --> 10:48.661
'cause my super smokin'-hot girlfriend

10:48.729 --> 10:50.429
is ditching me to save some tree frogs.

10:50.531 --> 10:51.797
We're talking about Paloma?

10:51.899 --> 10:53.899
'Cause she's very attractive,
but let's not get crazy.

10:55.202 --> 10:57.469
Okay. I think you latched onto
the less important part.

10:57.538 --> 10:58.671
Paloma is leaving me.

10:58.773 --> 11:00.638
She's going to Brazil
for the entire summer.

11:00.684 --> 11:01.761
I know.

11:01.802 --> 11:03.642
'Cause you just told me, so now I know.

11:03.744 --> 11:05.878
It sucks. I really liked her. Seriously.

11:05.947 --> 11:07.046
She's so hot.

11:07.114 --> 11:09.281
Yes, she's very
traditionally attractive.

11:09.383 --> 11:11.116
All she was talking about
was her "passion,"

11:11.218 --> 11:13.018
and I was hoping
maybe I was her passion.

11:13.087 --> 11:14.687
Well, it's just three months.

11:14.755 --> 11:16.388
It was just nice
to have someone, you know?

11:16.457 --> 11:19.625
And I really thought I'd had
a shot, but now it's gone.

11:20.594 --> 11:23.818
Ooh. Those are some "E-motions."

11:23.888 --> 11:25.472
Making me feel all guilty...

11:25.533 --> 11:27.333
for asking you to weigh in
on the paint swatches.

11:27.435 --> 11:28.771
I'll just take this off your plate.

11:28.865 --> 11:30.326
Hey, Lainey.

11:31.772 --> 11:33.539
You're a really good friend.

11:33.607 --> 11:34.740
Yeah.

11:38.279 --> 11:39.445
<i>I felt super guilty</i>

11:39.513 --> 11:41.647
<i>for messing up CB's chances with Paloma,</i>

11:41.716 --> 11:43.849
<i>but I wasn't sure what to do about it.</i>

11:43.951 --> 11:46.218
<i>So I decided to go for a walk
to clear my mind</i>

11:46.320 --> 11:48.387
<i>and hopefully feel
a little less clueless.</i>

11:48.489 --> 11:50.789
<i>But then I thought,
"Why should I feel guilty?"</i>

11:50.858 --> 11:53.525
<i>I was encouraging Paloma
to be an independent woman.</i>

11:53.594 --> 11:54.893
<i>What was so wrong with...</i>

11:54.996 --> 11:58.397
<i>Ooh! I wonder
if they have that in my size.</i>

11:58.499 --> 12:00.766
<i>It was totally not
what Wilma was saying.</i>

12:00.868 --> 12:03.569
<i>I wasn't trying to sabotage
CB's relationship.</i>

12:03.671 --> 12:05.437
<i>He was just a guy I worked with.</i>

12:05.506 --> 12:07.339
<i>I mean, sure, he'd become my friend...</i>

12:08.809 --> 12:10.909
<i>...a friend who always
made me laugh and feel good.</i>

12:11.012 --> 12:12.845
<i>But why was I buggin' about this?</i>

12:12.947 --> 12:14.747
<i>This was, like, CB.</i>

12:14.815 --> 12:16.982
<i>Okay, okay, I had to admit
he was kinda cute,</i>

12:17.051 --> 12:19.485
<i>and maybe some of his crazy
dance moves were kinda fun.</i>

12:19.587 --> 12:21.387
<i>But he deserved someone
who appreciated him,</i>

12:21.455 --> 12:23.489
<i>who really got him, ya know?</i>

12:23.591 --> 12:26.291
<i>Then, suddenly, it hit me.</i>

12:26.394 --> 12:27.860
Oh, my God!

12:31.065 --> 12:32.431
I like CB!

12:33.801 --> 12:37.169
<i>I was totally, crazy,
head over heels for CB!</i>

12:40.941 --> 12:42.074
Oh, boy.

12:42.176 --> 12:44.343
<i>As I was hit with a huge reality check,</i>

12:44.412 --> 12:47.146
<i>Glascott and Mellor were trying
to save Toby from his reality.</i>

12:47.214 --> 12:48.514
Toby, you can't go to prom

12:48.582 --> 12:50.315
because you're suspended from school.

12:50.418 --> 12:52.684
- Why?!
- Um... I don't know?

12:52.787 --> 12:54.820
- Seriously, John?
- I'm sorry, Rick.

12:54.889 --> 12:56.789
I didn't think he'd have
a follow-up question.

12:57.758 --> 12:58.891
What's going on?

12:58.959 --> 13:00.592
It seems like you two
don't want me going to prom.

13:00.661 --> 13:02.394
N... T-Toby, sit down for a second.

13:02.496 --> 13:04.696
W... I got to tell you something.

13:04.799 --> 13:06.365
We were trying
not to hurt your feelings,

13:06.467 --> 13:09.535
but Dawn doesn't like you
the way you think she does.

13:09.637 --> 13:11.036
What are you talking about?

13:11.105 --> 13:13.305
She just needed some guy
to fool her parents

13:13.407 --> 13:15.174
so she can go to prom.

13:15.242 --> 13:17.643
And then when she got there, she was...

13:17.711 --> 13:19.611
gonna ditch you for her boyfriend.

13:19.713 --> 13:21.580
Robbie McFadden.

13:21.649 --> 13:23.415
So I'm not her boyfriend.

13:23.484 --> 13:27.192
- She was just using me.
- Sorry, T-Man.

13:27.270 --> 13:29.588
God, I'm so stupid.

13:29.690 --> 13:32.591
Why would I think a girl
like Dawn would ever like me?

13:35.296 --> 13:36.995
Ahh, poor Toby.

13:37.064 --> 13:40.799
You know, Robbie McFadden put
a ferret in my desk drawer once.

13:40.901 --> 13:44.002
Wait. That's where
all that hair is coming from!

13:44.071 --> 13:45.971
<i>Toby was upset over the news about Dawn,</i>

13:46.040 --> 13:48.607
<i>but I was psyched to tell Wilma
about my CB epiphany.</i>

13:48.709 --> 13:50.042
Wilma!

13:50.111 --> 13:52.811
You were right. CB and I
are meant to be together.

13:52.913 --> 13:54.279
Ooh, I knew it!

13:54.381 --> 13:56.348
I was so right, and you denied it.

13:56.450 --> 13:58.283
But Wilma knew. Mm-hmm. Wilma knew.

13:58.385 --> 13:59.585
All right, enough with the gloating.

13:59.687 --> 14:00.986
But I don't know what to do about it

14:01.055 --> 14:02.521
'cause, you know,
the whole Paloma thing.

14:02.590 --> 14:05.991
Well, what if I told you
CB still has feelings for you?

14:06.093 --> 14:07.192
Did he tell you that?

14:07.294 --> 14:08.293
No.

14:08.395 --> 14:10.062
But... yes.

14:10.164 --> 14:11.630
- Huh?
- He didn't say it,

14:11.699 --> 14:13.232
but he didn't not say it.

14:13.334 --> 14:15.206
Wow. It's all lining up. Okay.

14:15.284 --> 14:16.902
Barry and I broke it off. I like CB.

14:16.988 --> 14:18.230
CB's girlfriend is going to Brazil.

14:18.308 --> 14:20.005
CB still doesn't
necessarily not like me.

14:20.107 --> 14:21.589
- It's fate.
- And Wilma.

14:21.659 --> 14:23.709
Now the only thing left to do
is tell CB how I feel.

14:23.811 --> 14:25.144
- But when?
- Now.

14:25.246 --> 14:27.146
- No.
- Yes. Here he comes.

14:27.214 --> 14:28.413
- What?
- Bye-bye.

14:28.516 --> 14:30.282
Hey, Lainey,
can I talk to you for a sec?

14:30.351 --> 14:32.017
- Yeah. I need to tell you something.
- I gotta tell you something.

14:32.119 --> 14:33.352
- Oh.
- Me first.

14:33.454 --> 14:35.821
No, me first.
It's... It's really important.

14:35.890 --> 14:38.624
Um, this whole Paloma leaving thing...

14:38.726 --> 14:42.227
it really got me thinking
about love and fate.

14:42.329 --> 14:43.529
Me too.

14:43.597 --> 14:46.231
- Long-distance relationships suck.
- They're the worst.

14:46.300 --> 14:47.698
And that's why I was thinking

14:47.784 --> 14:49.368
Paloma leaving is a sign.

14:49.436 --> 14:50.502
A big ol' sign.

14:50.604 --> 14:53.438
A sign for me to just do
what I was afraid to do.

14:53.541 --> 14:54.506
Don't be afraid.

14:54.608 --> 14:56.909
And to just really go after what I want.

14:57.011 --> 14:57.943
Go, Mr. Brown.

14:58.045 --> 15:00.345
So, what I want is...

15:03.851 --> 15:06.084
...a super rad trip to the Amazon

15:06.187 --> 15:07.486
with my girlfriend.

15:07.588 --> 15:08.854
- Wait. What?
- Yeah.

15:08.956 --> 15:12.691
I'm gonna take the summer va-cay
with my bay-bay, Palo-may.

15:13.562 --> 15:14.593
Oh.

15:14.632 --> 15:15.661
Wow.

15:15.763 --> 15:17.296
What was it that you were gonna tell me?

15:17.398 --> 15:19.665
Eh... Um...

15:19.767 --> 15:21.133
The paint.

15:21.235 --> 15:24.236
Sherman Williams just ran out
of "Bea Arthur's Hair" color,

15:24.338 --> 15:26.605
so now we're going with... gray.

15:26.707 --> 15:27.739
Oh, that's a bummer.

15:27.841 --> 15:29.875
Uh, yeah, but...

15:29.977 --> 15:32.778
you can't always get what you want.

15:38.761 --> 15:40.937
<i>I decided that CB
heading to Brazil with Paloma</i>

15:40.976 --> 15:42.029
<i>was for the best.</i>

15:42.094 --> 15:44.062
<i>Why screw up my life
even more than it is now?</i>

15:44.140 --> 15:46.000
How could you not tell CB how you feel?

15:46.054 --> 15:48.015
Before I could, he made his decision.

15:48.075 --> 15:49.141
He's going to Brazil.

15:49.211 --> 15:50.929
No, you're letting him go to Brazil.

15:50.984 --> 15:53.413
And I've worked too hard
to let you [bleep] this up.

15:53.482 --> 15:54.546
What am I supposed to do?

15:54.625 --> 15:57.517
Do not let him leave this gym tonight

15:57.586 --> 15:59.512
without telling him how you feel.

15:59.621 --> 16:02.150
Well, that's not gonna happen.
I can't even face him right now.

16:02.228 --> 16:05.125
I'm gonna go make sure
the Eiffel Tower doesn't fall over.

16:05.227 --> 16:07.017
I did not bolt it down,
like you told me to.

16:08.864 --> 16:10.964
<i>I was trying to steer clear of CB,</i>

16:11.033 --> 16:14.034
<i>but Wilma was gonna
make me face him head-on.</i>

16:14.136 --> 16:16.436
Um... a-attention, students!

16:16.505 --> 16:19.139
Uh, I know you're all itching
for your chance to Chunnel,

16:19.208 --> 16:21.708
but since insurance won't let us
send children through

16:21.777 --> 16:23.743
without it being tested on adults first,

16:23.812 --> 16:26.731
I'd like to send in my fellow engineers,

16:26.833 --> 16:30.098
Ms. Lewis and CB!

16:30.145 --> 16:31.151
Hey!

16:31.253 --> 16:33.420
Um, no. I'm clearly very busy.

16:33.522 --> 16:36.356
Oh, come on, Lainey. It'll be fun.

16:36.458 --> 16:37.924
Okay. Fine.

16:38.026 --> 16:39.226
Keep your hands and feet inside,

16:39.294 --> 16:40.794
and also watch your head,
'cause, you know,

16:40.896 --> 16:41.962
you're taller than the kids,

16:42.030 --> 16:43.663
and there might be
some nails sticking through.

16:43.765 --> 16:45.532
- Nails?
- Have a good ride.

16:54.443 --> 16:55.775
Hey, Tobester.

16:56.979 --> 16:58.545
Not in the mood to talk.

16:58.647 --> 16:59.980
Well...

17:00.082 --> 17:02.415
if it's any consolation, I know
what you're going through.

17:02.440 --> 17:03.460
How?

17:03.485 --> 17:05.452
I wasn't always the rough-hewn Greek God

17:05.520 --> 17:06.586
you see before you.

17:06.655 --> 17:08.555
When I was your age,
I was gangly and awkward.

17:08.656 --> 17:10.824
I was a tiny, little wisp,
just like you.

17:10.925 --> 17:12.092
Not helping.

17:12.194 --> 17:14.894
I had absolutely no moves
with girls whatsoever.

17:14.963 --> 17:17.497
I was constantly being cast
aside, like I didn't matter.

17:17.566 --> 17:18.964
Where is this going?

17:19.034 --> 17:20.666
I see myself in you.

17:20.736 --> 17:21.867
And I learned that

17:21.936 --> 17:24.671
for all the times
you strike out with a girl,

17:24.772 --> 17:26.473
eventually, you hit a home run

17:26.575 --> 17:28.241
and you meet somebody
who likes you back.

17:28.310 --> 17:30.110
What if I'm the guy
that keeps striking out?

17:30.178 --> 17:32.646
In the big leagues, the guys
that strike out the most

17:32.714 --> 17:34.848
are also the guys
that hit the most home runs.

17:34.950 --> 17:36.516
Because they keep on swinging.

17:38.176 --> 17:39.119
Thanks, Coach.

17:50.299 --> 17:52.098
Toby. What are you doing here?

17:52.200 --> 17:54.150
- Shouldn't you be at prom?
- No.

17:54.216 --> 17:56.549
I came here to tell you I'm sorry.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.738
I shouldn't have treated you how I did.

17:58.807 --> 18:00.385
This is where I want to be.

18:00.471 --> 18:02.042
Apology accepted.

18:02.110 --> 18:04.376
You look good, like when
Bugs Bunny goes to the opera.

18:04.462 --> 18:06.509
Thanks. That's what I was going for.

18:07.849 --> 18:10.063
It's a pretty weird prom, huh?

18:10.165 --> 18:11.959
Yeah.

18:12.054 --> 18:14.554
We really should've gone with
"Under the Sea" or something normal.

18:16.158 --> 18:17.223
Are you okay?

18:18.660 --> 18:20.329
Yeah. Fine.

18:20.384 --> 18:21.657
Totally fine.

18:21.720 --> 18:22.939
I don't think you are.

18:25.300 --> 18:28.702
I know we've been talking
about me and Paloma so much,

18:28.770 --> 18:30.670
I haven't really checked in
to see how you're doing

18:30.739 --> 18:32.939
with your Barry breakup, so...

18:33.008 --> 18:34.441
No, it's not that.

18:34.509 --> 18:35.742
Then what is it?

18:37.713 --> 18:39.512
Come on. You can tell me
anything, Lainey.

18:39.614 --> 18:41.181
What's... What's going on?

18:42.918 --> 18:44.317
Don't go.

18:45.487 --> 18:46.720
To Brazil.

18:46.822 --> 18:47.945
Why not?

18:48.030 --> 18:49.797
Because I want you to stay.

18:52.561 --> 18:54.016
Give me a reason to stay.

19:17.919 --> 19:19.219
How was your Chunnel ride?

19:22.891 --> 19:24.818
Well, ooo-la-la.

19:26.228 --> 19:28.395
<i>Taking big chances can be scary.</i>

19:28.463 --> 19:30.597
<i>You don't always know
how it's going to work out.</i>

19:31.933 --> 19:33.833
<i>But that doesn't mean you shouldn't try.</i>

19:36.304 --> 19:38.004
<i>Because life can be unpredictable.</i>

19:38.106 --> 19:39.839
<i>You can start off in one place</i>

19:39.908 --> 19:41.999
<i>and wind up somewhere totally different.</i>

19:45.013 --> 19:48.381
<i>And you're not exactly sure
what to do next.</i>

19:50.152 --> 19:53.219
<i>You're left wondering
what the future will hold.</i>

19:53.321 --> 19:55.655
<i>But excited to find out.</i>

20:07.516 --> 20:10.382
Let's play laser tag!

20:10.485 --> 20:13.085
Do you feel lucky, punk?

20:13.188 --> 20:15.755
Hasta la vista, baby.

20:15.857 --> 20:17.824
You talkin' to me?

20:17.926 --> 20:21.421
You ever play roulette?
Always bet on Mellor.

20:22.230 --> 20:25.263
You ever dance with
the devil in the pale moonlight?

20:25.834 --> 20:29.286
Say hello to my little friend!

20:29.437 --> 20:31.404
Get off my plane!

20:31.506 --> 20:34.769
I'm in the Matrix!

20:52.794 --> 20:55.361
And we want to thank
all of the teachers out there.

20:55.463 --> 20:58.798
You guys are the true heroes...
now more than ever.

20:58.900 --> 21:00.195
So thank you.

21:00.262 --> 21:05.262
