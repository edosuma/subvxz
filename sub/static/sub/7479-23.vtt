WEBVTT

00:15.316 --> 00:18.251
You okay?
You seem like something's wrong.

00:18.452 --> 00:21.819
No, I'm okay. It's just one
of those days at work, you know?

00:21.989 --> 00:24.048
Well, you're off now,
so snap out of it.

00:24.225 --> 00:26.090
We're supposed to be having fun.

00:26.894 --> 00:28.020
I'm gonna use the restroom.

00:28.195 --> 00:30.959
I better see two more drinks
on the table by the time I get back.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.739
- You ready?
- I'm ready. Are you ready?

00:42.543 --> 00:44.670
- Guess so.
- Okay, then.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.942
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are now about to witness

00:51.118 --> 00:54.576
the end of Sean Koster's life
as we know it.

01:16.143 --> 01:17.576
What are you doing?

01:19.713 --> 01:21.943
Michelle April Ardell...

01:24.518 --> 01:25.883
will you marry me?

01:34.295 --> 01:35.455
Oh, my God.

02:13.434 --> 02:15.959
- Are you mad at me?
- Why would I be mad?

02:16.136 --> 02:18.536
It's your vacation.
Do whatever you want.

02:18.706 --> 02:19.832
Oh, gee, thanks for that.

02:20.007 --> 02:22.703
I thought you might wanna
do something together, that's all.

02:22.876 --> 02:26.175
- You're upset I didn't invite you.
- I'm not upset, disappointed maybe.

02:26.347 --> 02:27.939
Surprised definitely.

02:28.115 --> 02:29.776
You always say,
we're kind of like family.

02:29.950 --> 02:32.282
If you wanna come, come.
I'll even buy you a ticket today.

02:32.453 --> 02:34.512
I'm not taking a mercy invite.

02:38.492 --> 02:42.326
Of course I never really thought of you
as a cruise ship kind of guy.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.521
It's a sailboat.

02:46.100 --> 02:47.692
Uh, I'm sorry.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.358
We need you guys up in Ops.

02:55.809 --> 02:56.833
We're training.

02:57.878 --> 03:00.540
- Okay.
- It's self-defense.

03:01.248 --> 03:02.909
Right.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.617
Oh, how was Jazzercise?

03:13.026 --> 03:16.359
Hey, did one of you guys leave your leg
warmers in the locker room yesterday?

03:20.334 --> 03:21.699
What do we got, Eric?

03:22.503 --> 03:24.528
This footage was taken last night
by a patron

03:24.705 --> 03:26.570
at Surfside Sully's in Santa Monica.

03:27.274 --> 03:29.868
- Where's Hetty?
- On the phone with Director Vance.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.375
They've been going at it
for 20 minutes.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.537
The victim in the video
has yet to be identified.

03:34.715 --> 03:38.207
He had no ID and his face and
fingerprints were essentially melted.

03:38.385 --> 03:39.784
We're still waiting on dental.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.682
- Nobody saw who did it?
- Nope.

03:41.855 --> 03:44.016
Witnesses said
he came out of nowhere.

03:44.191 --> 03:47.854
Autopsy revealed he'd been severely
beaten with some sort of blunt object

03:48.028 --> 03:49.461
before being set ablaze.

03:49.663 --> 03:52.598
He suffered multiple fractures
including the back of the skull.

03:52.766 --> 03:54.563
Well, somebody wanted him dead.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.566
Dead and unidentifiable.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.617
Witnesses had a hard time
putting out the flames

03:58.806 --> 04:00.740
because the fire
was phosphorus-based.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.933
The victim had an artificial knee joint,

04:03.110 --> 04:05.408
so I'm running the serial number
through manufacturer

04:05.579 --> 04:08.275
and hospital records trying
to get a positive identification.

04:08.449 --> 04:09.814
And why us?

04:09.983 --> 04:12.747
The presence of phosphorus isn't
enough to warrant our involvement.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.387
On its own, no.

04:14.555 --> 04:17.456
But the body had also been exposed
to fluorodeoxyglucose.

04:17.624 --> 04:20.149
- The fire couldn't hide that.
- Radiopharmaceuticals.

04:20.327 --> 04:22.761
The isotope matches
the brachytherapy canisters

04:22.930 --> 04:25.763
that were stolen from
Cal West Hospital back in January.

04:25.933 --> 04:31.098
As you recall, Jake Varley and
Wendell Hertz murdered Yusef Afzal,

04:31.271 --> 04:34.798
while trying to gain access
to the nuclear medicine department.

04:34.975 --> 04:38.274
When we caught these guys trying to
sell the canisters, they had three left.

04:38.579 --> 04:41.070
Looks like we found the fourth
and it could have been opened.

04:42.749 --> 04:44.944
Kensi and I can hit the crime scene,
see what we find.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.018
Great. Just leave your surfboard
in the lockup.

04:47.221 --> 04:48.245
What?

04:48.422 --> 04:50.083
Don't look at me.
I didn't say anything.

04:50.257 --> 04:52.691
She doesn't have to. You left
a sand bunker under your chair

04:52.860 --> 04:54.293
after your last "investigation."

04:54.461 --> 04:55.951
Yeah, that was from my shoes,

04:56.129 --> 04:58.597
from my shoes
from walking around the crime scene.

04:58.765 --> 05:02.257
Mm-hm. And the seawater that was
coming out of your nose all day?

05:02.436 --> 05:05.667
It's allergies. I've got allergies.

05:05.839 --> 05:10.105
No. This is not a debate.

05:10.511 --> 05:13.241
That's no one's call but mine.

05:14.348 --> 05:17.784
Oh, rubbish. He's lying.

05:17.951 --> 05:20.545
The hell I will.

05:21.655 --> 05:24.283
- Mother Hubbard.
- No food in the cupboard?

05:26.260 --> 05:28.990
- Something I can do?
- No.

05:29.763 --> 05:34.791
No, this one's stuck squarely in my lap,
I'm afraid.

05:35.068 --> 05:40.199
Oh, it's just all a bunch
of bureaucratic nonsense anyway.

05:40.374 --> 05:44.401
We must take it all
with a grain of salt.

05:46.046 --> 05:50.312
I find that it helps if the salt is
followed by a shot of tequila and some lime.

05:51.218 --> 05:53.880
I like the way you think, Mr. Callen.

05:54.221 --> 05:55.688
Hey.

05:56.323 --> 05:58.223
Eric identified the artificial knee.

05:58.825 --> 06:01.350
It went to a recipient
named Brent Dundas,

06:01.528 --> 06:05.487
former Illinois construction worker,
injured in an industrial accident.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.327
We've got a Culver City address.

06:15.809 --> 06:19.006
Looks like somebody might
have been looking for something.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.242
Either that or Brent has a girlfriend.

06:24.818 --> 06:26.683
You know how women never close
a drawer?

06:26.853 --> 06:28.844
They're coming to get something
then they never do

06:29.022 --> 06:30.353
and you wind up banging into it.

06:30.524 --> 06:32.583
Mm-hm. Trouble in paradise?

06:39.066 --> 06:40.624
Hey.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.470
Special Warfare Insignia.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.737
Looks like our dead guy
might have been a SEAL.

06:58.750 --> 07:00.047
Yeah, I got it. Thanks, Eric.

07:00.251 --> 07:03.152
- And send Forensics over to follow up.
- Okay.

07:03.888 --> 07:06.356
So the Navy has no record of a SEAL
named Brent Dundas.

07:06.524 --> 07:09.391
They have no record of Brent Dundas
ever being in the Navy, period.

07:09.560 --> 07:12.051
- You find anything?
- Trace amounts of radiation.

07:12.263 --> 07:13.423
Nothing to get excited about.

07:13.564 --> 07:16.158
If that canister was here,
it's gone now.

07:16.534 --> 07:17.831
Here we go.

07:18.002 --> 07:19.299
Scorch marks.

07:19.470 --> 07:21.370
No, nope, I'm good, thanks.

07:21.539 --> 07:22.801
There.

07:22.974 --> 07:25.169
Dark stains, looks like oil,

07:25.343 --> 07:27.743
but I bet you Forensics is gonna prove
it's a blood trail.

07:27.912 --> 07:30.642
Well, good work, Lassie.
Now all you gotta do is find Timmy.

07:30.815 --> 07:33.875
Yeah, feel free to dazzle me
with your detective skills at any time.

07:34.052 --> 07:36.418
Heh, heh.
You couldn't handle my skills.

07:36.587 --> 07:38.282
I just threw up in my mouth
a little bit.

07:38.556 --> 07:39.648
That's classy.

07:39.824 --> 07:43.021
Okay, so the address Eric gave us
for Brent Dundas is in Culver City,

07:43.194 --> 07:44.491
so we know he didn't walk here.

07:44.662 --> 07:46.687
He didn't have any keys.
He was missing a wallet.

07:46.864 --> 07:49.025
Killer could have taken both
to conceal his identity.

07:49.200 --> 07:51.430
Which is why they set him on fire
with phosphorus.

07:51.602 --> 07:53.433
They knew his body
would be unidentifiable.

07:53.604 --> 07:56.937
He does what anybody on fire would
do, which is try to get to some water.

07:57.108 --> 07:58.871
Ooh. Check it out.

07:59.043 --> 08:02.444
- A Navy SEALs bumper sticker.
- SEALs don't usually advertise.

08:04.882 --> 08:07.077
- Kensi.
- Hey, Eric, I need you to run a plate.

08:07.251 --> 08:11.711
It's 4-Papa-Charlie-India-485.
Red Camry.

08:11.889 --> 08:13.322
Got it.

08:13.958 --> 08:17.553
Yeah, that vehicle is registered
to Brent Dundas.

08:17.728 --> 08:19.093
What?

08:19.263 --> 08:20.821
When?

08:21.866 --> 08:23.697
How you say? Bingo.

08:23.868 --> 08:26.894
Okay. Thanks for the update.
Keep us informed.

08:28.272 --> 08:30.604
Car is registered to Brent Dundas,
but get this,

08:30.775 --> 08:32.402
he's not really a Navy SEAL.

08:32.577 --> 08:33.942
You sure about that?

08:42.787 --> 08:45.449
- Nice job locating Brent Dundas' car.
- Thank you.

08:46.924 --> 08:48.414
Forensics is working it over now.

08:48.593 --> 08:51.118
So we have a Navy SEAL impostor
exposed to radiation.

08:51.295 --> 08:53.729
A trunk full of scuba gear
and explosives.

08:53.898 --> 08:56.059
Sounds like a guy trying
to make a dirty bomb.

08:56.234 --> 08:58.259
Only Brent Dundas didn't know
how to make a bomb.

08:58.436 --> 09:00.495
- How do you know that?
- Internet searches.

09:00.671 --> 09:02.571
He was looking up
bomb-making instructions.

09:02.740 --> 09:04.469
I'm trying to track purchases
of phosphorus

09:04.642 --> 09:05.802
but I'm not having much luck.

09:05.977 --> 09:07.740
Brent Dundas'
electronic footprint,

09:07.912 --> 09:10.176
however, shows regular
cash withdrawals from an ATM,

09:10.381 --> 09:13.145
located in a Santa Monica bar
called the Prince O' Whales,

09:13.317 --> 09:17.253
including $300 less than two hours
before he was killed.

09:17.421 --> 09:20.618
And the bar is within walking distance
from where you guys found his car.

09:20.791 --> 09:24.318
I think it's time we pay
the Prince O' Whales bar a visit.

09:24.495 --> 09:26.019
Now we're talking.

09:26.197 --> 09:30.657
Oh, actually, detective, Hetty asked
if she could speak with you alone.

09:30.835 --> 09:32.496
Oh, someone's in trouble.

09:32.670 --> 09:35.434
- Yeah, right.
- Just remember the distress word.

09:35.606 --> 09:38.302
Yeah, if that doesn't work,
just fake a seizure.

09:38.476 --> 09:41.673
I'm not in trouble. I'm not in trouble.

09:42.313 --> 09:44.679
Hey, am I in trouble?

10:00.298 --> 10:02.493
Nell said you wanted to see me.

10:03.034 --> 10:05.025
I'm not in some sort of trouble,
am I?

10:06.571 --> 10:08.505
Should you be?

10:09.040 --> 10:11.508
Do you have something to confess?

10:12.343 --> 10:14.072
No.

10:17.248 --> 10:20.877
Well, in that case, this is for you.

10:21.052 --> 10:22.644
This is for me.

10:22.820 --> 10:24.447
You want me...

10:25.556 --> 10:27.319
to read it?

10:28.226 --> 10:30.251
You want me to resign?

10:30.461 --> 10:32.395
Well, I thought I was doing
a good job.

10:32.563 --> 10:35.054
Wait, is this about your Segway?
Because if l...

10:35.233 --> 10:37.895
Read the entire page, please?

10:39.870 --> 10:41.667
Okay.

10:44.375 --> 10:46.366
From L.A.P.D.

10:46.544 --> 10:50.036
Oh, you want me to resign
from the police force?

10:50.214 --> 10:55.618
Mm-hm. The second page
is an application to join NCIS

10:55.786 --> 10:58.721
on a permanent basis as an agent.

11:06.264 --> 11:08.528
Wow. Heh.

11:08.699 --> 11:14.194
Uh, I'm flattered, Hetty. Thank you.

11:14.372 --> 11:17.432
But I just don't know if this
is the right thing for me right now.

11:17.608 --> 11:19.599
You know, because I'm a cop

11:19.777 --> 11:23.440
and I think it's more than what I do,
I think it's who I am.

11:24.548 --> 11:26.482
I understand.

11:26.651 --> 11:32.112
But things do change and, uh,
when they do, it pays to be ready.

11:32.823 --> 11:37.385
Keep it, in case you ever change
your mind.

11:37.561 --> 11:41.588
I've signed and dated it
so it's ready whenever you are.

11:43.134 --> 11:44.829
Okay.

11:45.836 --> 11:47.326
Thank you.

11:51.909 --> 11:54.400
What about my Segway?

11:56.480 --> 11:59.313
- Are you on double-secret probation?
- No.

11:59.483 --> 12:00.609
Is it the Segway?

12:00.785 --> 12:02.252
No. It was nothing.

12:02.420 --> 12:04.354
Just some paperwork
that has to do with L.A.P.D.

12:04.555 --> 12:06.989
And my liaison position here.

12:14.565 --> 12:17.466
- This looks like your kind of place.
- Looks like a dive.

12:17.635 --> 12:21.093
Yeah, like I said,
it's your kind of place.

12:21.272 --> 12:22.466
So, what about pirates?

12:22.940 --> 12:25.340
- What?
- They're a real problem these days.

12:25.509 --> 12:28.603
We'll be okay. They don't come this far
inland unless they're on vacation.

12:28.779 --> 12:30.178
I'm talking about your sailboat.

12:30.348 --> 12:32.339
It's not my sailboat. It's a charter.

12:32.516 --> 12:36.008
And, no, I'm not worried about pirates.
SEALs eat pirates for breakfast.

12:36.187 --> 12:38.155
What do they taste like, chicken?

12:38.322 --> 12:39.584
Fish sticks.

12:40.157 --> 12:41.852
Here you go.

12:42.593 --> 12:45.824
- It's not a bad beer.
- No. It's good.

12:45.996 --> 12:47.463
Hey, what can I get you, fellas?

12:50.134 --> 12:51.601
You know this guy?

12:52.970 --> 12:54.369
Who are you?

12:54.538 --> 12:55.732
Federal agents.

12:56.674 --> 12:57.971
Don't get up.

12:58.142 --> 12:59.473
It's all right.

13:01.812 --> 13:03.905
Yeah, I know him.
Brian Young, he's a regular.

13:04.115 --> 13:06.709
Guy's a retired Navy SEAL.
Sits right there almost every night.

13:06.884 --> 13:09.819
You know this guy as Brian Young,
not Brent Dundas?

13:10.254 --> 13:12.552
Never heard of Brent Dundas.

13:12.990 --> 13:14.514
You sure you boys done this before?

13:14.692 --> 13:17.252
- When's the last time you saw him?
- Yesterday.

13:17.428 --> 13:20.226
Hey, Star, when did Brian come
in last night?

13:20.398 --> 13:23.026
Uh, about 6, I think.

13:23.200 --> 13:24.599
I don't remember seeing him leave,

13:24.769 --> 13:28.728
but I think it was earlier than normal
for him, though, like 7, maybe.

13:28.906 --> 13:31.136
- Why?
- He's dead.

13:32.643 --> 13:34.907
Someone bashed his head in,
set him on fire.

13:35.079 --> 13:37.741
- What?
- You think that was Brian?

13:38.682 --> 13:40.616
I was just talking to him last night.

13:40.785 --> 13:42.685
Was he with anyone?

13:42.953 --> 13:44.944
He didn't come in with anyone, no.

13:46.724 --> 13:50.455
I think he may have been sitting
with someone at some point.

13:50.661 --> 13:54.290
He was at the bar, I was waiting tables.
It was busy.

13:54.665 --> 13:56.724
Why would someone do this?

13:56.901 --> 13:59.096
He was such a nice guy.

13:59.270 --> 14:00.464
Excuse me.

14:01.906 --> 14:03.806
You should've seen her
when her cat died.

14:03.974 --> 14:05.635
Had to give her Memorial Day
weekend off.

14:05.810 --> 14:08.210
The whole weekend for a cat.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.739
Like to take a look
at your surveillance tapes.

14:12.817 --> 14:15.217
Sure, yeah,
just show me a warrant.

14:15.386 --> 14:16.819
That's how it's gonna be?

14:16.987 --> 14:21.117
Hey, I'd like to help you boys out, man,
my customers got privacy rights.

14:22.293 --> 14:23.817
Well, we'll be back.

14:23.994 --> 14:25.256
Bring some friends, man.

14:25.429 --> 14:29.058
Two-for-one pitchers of draft
between 5 and 6.

14:29.233 --> 14:30.825
May I?

14:42.813 --> 14:45.475
Trace amounts of radiation.
Could be from the missing canister.

14:45.649 --> 14:48.345
- Could be our guy.
- Or somebody he was with.

14:48.519 --> 14:50.987
What do you think is up with the alias,
Brian Young?

14:51.155 --> 14:52.315
Fake SEAL, fake name.

14:52.490 --> 14:54.458
Something tells me
by the time we get a warrant,

14:54.625 --> 14:57.719
anything we could use on
those surveillance tapes will be gone.

15:00.097 --> 15:01.792
- Where is he?
- In the back.

15:02.466 --> 15:04.263
- Don't get up.
- Mr. Fallon's busy

15:04.435 --> 15:05.595
and you guys need a warrant.

15:05.769 --> 15:07.009
So I suggest you turn around...

15:09.240 --> 15:11.105
I said, don't get up.

15:13.744 --> 15:16.474
- Hey, I told you you need a warrant!
- We have probable cause.

15:16.647 --> 15:17.739
And you need a lawyer.

15:29.260 --> 15:31.558
I wasn't gonna destroy
any surveillance footage.

15:31.762 --> 15:33.889
I was just curious to see for myself.

15:34.064 --> 15:35.463
You didn't have a beef with him?

15:35.633 --> 15:37.464
No, man, I barely knew the guy.

15:37.635 --> 15:39.796
Brian was a customer
that came in to drink,

15:39.970 --> 15:42.734
flirt with the waitresses
and tell the occasional war story.

15:42.907 --> 15:44.772
Well, he wasn't in any war.

15:45.509 --> 15:49.240
His name wasn't Brian Young,
it was Brent Dundas.

15:49.413 --> 15:52.644
He wasn't a Navy SEAL
that had his leg messed up in an IED.

15:52.816 --> 15:56.013
Some guy living off of workman's
comp from a construction accident.

15:57.555 --> 16:02.686
What he told me, he was retired and
working for private contractors now.

16:02.860 --> 16:04.487
You know, Blackwater kind of stuff.

16:04.995 --> 16:06.986
And he had some, uh...

16:07.164 --> 16:10.656
He had some kind of classified
assignment he couldn't talk about.

16:10.834 --> 16:13.394
But he was celebrating, you know,
like he had...

16:13.571 --> 16:15.198
He'd come in to some money
or something.

16:15.372 --> 16:17.340
You know, buying drinks
for everybody and stuff.

16:17.708 --> 16:20.268
What about his friends or people
he was hanging around with?

16:20.444 --> 16:23.345
No, if it wasn't
for the Navy SEAL thing,

16:23.514 --> 16:27.348
I would have thought the guy
was a loser, always by himself.

16:27.518 --> 16:29.543
Yeah, I just thought
it was the lone wolf thing.

16:29.720 --> 16:31.711
Yeah, he had a shine on for Star.

16:31.889 --> 16:33.413
He talked to her a lot.

16:34.391 --> 16:37.087
But you got any more questions,
talk to her,

16:37.261 --> 16:39.195
because I'm done
until I see a lawyer.

16:48.839 --> 16:51.535
He's a bottom-feeder,
but I believe him.

16:51.709 --> 16:55.270
It doesn't get us any closer
to finding the dirty bomb material.

16:55.446 --> 16:57.107
- How's it going?
- It's not.

16:57.281 --> 16:59.408
- You find anything?
- Yeah.

16:59.583 --> 17:01.244
This is the real Brian Young.

17:01.652 --> 17:04.712
He was a Navy SEAL
who died during the invasion of Iraq.

17:04.887 --> 17:07.378
Young was born in Wisconsin,
but grew up in Illinois

17:07.558 --> 17:09.719
and attended high school
with guess who?

17:09.893 --> 17:12.259
- Brent Dundas.
- You've played this game before.

17:12.429 --> 17:14.454
They were even
on the same swim team.

17:14.632 --> 17:17.601
So not only did Brent Dundas
and Brian Young know each other,

17:17.768 --> 17:19.598
it's reasonable to believe
they were friends.

17:19.770 --> 17:21.896
That's where Brent got his stories
and his identity.

17:22.071 --> 17:23.835
Right.
Our friend the bartender, here, said,

17:24.008 --> 17:26.499
we ought to talk to one
of his waitresses, Star.

17:26.676 --> 17:28.440
She had a lot of face time
with the victim.

17:28.612 --> 17:31.240
Why don't you guys check it out,
see if she knows anything?

17:31.415 --> 17:34.816
Sam and I are gonna go through
the surveillance tapes from the bar.

17:42.092 --> 17:43.821
What are you doing?

17:44.528 --> 17:48.521
Um... Nell's hogging the computers up
in Ops, running a multi-variant search.

17:48.699 --> 17:49.757
What is that smell?

17:50.100 --> 17:51.158
Oh, sardines.

17:51.335 --> 17:54.099
They're really high
in Omega-3 fatty acids.

17:54.271 --> 17:57.502
Smells like cat food.
No wonder Nell kicked you out.

17:57.675 --> 17:59.019
I don't know what's worse,
the smell in here

17:59.043 --> 18:00.670
or that the fact
you were eating in Ops.

18:00.844 --> 18:02.835
If Hetty caught you,
she would shoot you on sight.

18:03.013 --> 18:05.140
- Where is Hetty?
- I haven't seen her.

18:05.315 --> 18:08.443
No wonder you're acting so brave.
I've gotta find her.

18:11.221 --> 18:13.348
You wanna keep going through
the surveillance tapes?

18:13.524 --> 18:17.016
Not with you. You and your fish breath
go work in the gadget room.

18:18.062 --> 18:19.529
Yeah.

18:23.534 --> 18:25.798
You threw your empty sardine can
in my recycling bin?

18:26.837 --> 18:30.295
- Gotta save the planet, man.
- Go save it somewhere else.

18:35.312 --> 18:37.303
And bring me a new bin.

18:42.052 --> 18:43.383
Nell, have you seen Hetty?

18:43.554 --> 18:46.216
No, not since this morning.

18:48.358 --> 18:51.327
- What are you doing?
- Oh, I'm looking for bacon.

18:51.495 --> 18:53.986
As in Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.

18:54.398 --> 18:56.764
Uh, collaboration distance?

18:56.967 --> 18:59.060
Cluster analysis?

18:59.236 --> 19:01.500
Okay, basically, I'm going through
the Prince O' Whales

19:01.672 --> 19:03.833
credit card transactions
of the past couple of months,

19:04.007 --> 19:05.565
and data mining
through their customers

19:05.743 --> 19:07.677
to find any links
between Varley and Hertz.

19:07.845 --> 19:10.279
The two men
who stole the radiopharmaceuticals.

19:10.481 --> 19:12.711
Hopefully, I'll find a common vector.

19:13.584 --> 19:16.280
- Good luck with that.
- Hm.

19:17.221 --> 19:18.381
Right.

19:18.689 --> 19:20.247
Brian was always a gentleman.

19:20.424 --> 19:21.482
You mean Brent?

19:22.726 --> 19:24.853
- Did you see him outside of work?
- No.

19:25.028 --> 19:28.589
No, we never dated or anything,
if that's what you're asking.

19:29.299 --> 19:33.895
He seemed like a kind soul,
but tortured.

19:34.071 --> 19:36.801
Like he was always a little sad.

19:37.007 --> 19:38.565
I figured it was from being
in the war.

19:38.742 --> 19:41.370
Only he wasn't, his friend was.

19:41.545 --> 19:44.742
He said he lost his best friend
in the war.

19:45.149 --> 19:47.379
Maybe he just never got over it.

19:48.051 --> 19:51.043
Maybe it was Brian... Brent's...

19:51.221 --> 19:54.088
Brent's way
of honoring his dead friend.

19:54.258 --> 19:55.486
By becoming him?

19:55.659 --> 19:57.456
It was his way of being someone
he wasn't.

19:57.628 --> 19:59.755
A lot of people want a better life
for themselves

19:59.930 --> 20:02.398
and dream of being someone
they're not.

20:03.267 --> 20:07.169
"Star" sounds a lot better
than Sarah Anne Shulman

20:07.337 --> 20:09.669
from Tunkhannock, Pennsylvania.

20:09.840 --> 20:12.274
I don't know about that,
Sarah Anne sounds pretty to me.

20:13.410 --> 20:16.902
So are you two like
"together" together?

20:17.080 --> 20:20.015
- Is it that obvious?
- No, we're just partners.

20:20.184 --> 20:22.345
- With privileges.
- Oh, definitely not.

20:22.553 --> 20:23.918
- Kind of. What about you?
- No.

20:24.087 --> 20:25.145
Are you in a relationship?

20:26.423 --> 20:28.152
Not really.

20:29.626 --> 20:30.684
Now, that's a crime.

20:30.861 --> 20:34.627
Uh... You should take this, just in case
you remember anything else.

20:34.798 --> 20:36.857
Okay, thank you very much, Star.

20:37.067 --> 20:40.059
Even if you just, you know,
need to talk or anything.

20:40.771 --> 20:43.137
I'm gonna take this.
It's for your own security.

20:43.307 --> 20:44.672
And we're gonna go.

20:44.842 --> 20:46.969
What are you doing?

20:47.144 --> 20:49.669
I was just being a good cop.

20:52.783 --> 20:54.148
Cop blocker!

20:54.318 --> 20:56.115
I'm gonna crush the life out of you.

20:56.286 --> 20:58.345
I'm gonna gut you like a fish.

21:01.458 --> 21:04.621
Problem, Mr. Hanna?

21:05.863 --> 21:07.558
We need a new plasma.

21:07.731 --> 21:09.323
What's wrong with this one?

21:09.499 --> 21:11.831
It's stupid and it's pissing me off.

21:12.002 --> 21:14.470
Seriously, I'm gonna shoot it.

21:15.973 --> 21:18.373
What's really wrong, Sam?

21:19.243 --> 21:21.507
You mean besides a guy posing
as a SEAL

21:21.678 --> 21:23.043
that may have built a dirty bomb?

21:23.213 --> 21:26.842
Oh, well, that is a serious situation.

21:27.017 --> 21:29.485
All the more reason
to keep one's cool.

21:29.653 --> 21:31.416
I'm cool.

21:32.256 --> 21:33.689
You know,

21:33.991 --> 21:39.896
it's been a very long time
since I have heard you laugh, Sam.

21:40.397 --> 21:44.857
Hell, life itself can be absurd.

21:45.168 --> 21:46.931
But you have to embrace that.

21:47.537 --> 21:50.028
If you can't smile now,

21:50.207 --> 21:55.406
how can you possibly laugh
in the face of death?

21:55.579 --> 21:57.342
Hetty, why are you telling me this?

21:57.514 --> 22:03.510
As a sailor, Sam, you know
the importance of a solid anchor.

22:03.954 --> 22:09.722
You have your faith, your family,
your sense of humor.

22:10.861 --> 22:15.059
Mr. Callen doesn't think
he needs anyone.

22:15.232 --> 22:17.257
He does. He needs you.

22:17.434 --> 22:19.129
You're his anchor.

22:19.303 --> 22:22.067
And I sense there's a storm coming.

22:22.706 --> 22:25.698
Hetty, you're a lot of things,
but a psychic isn't one of them.

22:26.276 --> 22:28.471
You wanna level with me?

22:29.279 --> 22:31.406
I just did.

22:36.053 --> 22:38.283
I give up. Can't find her anywhere.

22:39.423 --> 22:42.722
You're kidding, right?
She was just here.

22:42.893 --> 22:44.554
Seriously,
what kind of tracker are you?

22:45.195 --> 22:46.628
Well, she's avoiding me.

22:46.797 --> 22:48.059
What was she talking about?

22:48.465 --> 22:51.764
Ships, anchors, death.

22:51.935 --> 22:54.130
To be honest,
she's kind of creeping me out.

22:54.304 --> 22:56.772
I got bacon.

22:56.940 --> 22:57.998
What?

22:58.208 --> 23:00.301
A man by the name of Ryan Long

23:00.477 --> 23:03.503
split a restaurant check
with Wendell Hertz last December.

23:03.714 --> 23:07.013
In February, he paid a bar tab
at the Prince O' Whales

23:07.217 --> 23:10.482
the same night that Brent Dundas
made a withdrawal from their ATM.

23:10.654 --> 23:14.351
So Ryan Long is the link between
the stolen radiopharmaceuticals

23:14.524 --> 23:17.152
and our dead man, Brent Dundas.

23:17.327 --> 23:19.022
And that, my friends, is bacon.

23:19.229 --> 23:21.129
Ryan Long's been arrested
on several occasions.

23:21.298 --> 23:24.290
Mostly minor offenses
stemming from various protests.

23:24.468 --> 23:26.368
He's a self-proclaimed anarchist.

23:26.937 --> 23:27.995
You got an address?

23:28.305 --> 23:30.466
No. He only uses a P.O. Box.

23:30.640 --> 23:32.369
He does, however,
own a motor home

23:32.542 --> 23:34.601
that Eric tracked down
using Kaleidoscope.

23:34.778 --> 23:39.044
And as of 11 minutes ago, it was
in Playa del Rey near the airport.

23:44.621 --> 23:47.055
Looks like it's been abandoned.

23:52.462 --> 23:54.828
Maybe that's what I'll do.
I'm gonna rent an RV.

23:54.998 --> 23:57.558
Heh. I'd love to see you
in a trailer park.

23:57.768 --> 24:00.066
No, no, no. Drive across country.

24:01.171 --> 24:03.298
Sailing the backwaters of America.

24:03.473 --> 24:06.340
Just me and the open road
as my companion.

24:06.510 --> 24:08.671
You're breaking my heart.

24:09.046 --> 24:10.707
Ryan?

24:11.815 --> 24:14.079
Like I said, abandoned.

24:46.183 --> 24:48.378
Nice driving, slick.

24:48.618 --> 24:51.746
You not only wrecked your wheels,
you totaled your house.

25:07.903 --> 25:09.666
You know this guy?

25:12.308 --> 25:13.468
No?

25:15.444 --> 25:16.775
Well, this is what he looked like

25:16.945 --> 25:19.675
after he was lit on fire
with white phosphorus.

25:20.783 --> 25:23.251
- I had nothing to do with that.
- Why'd you try and get away?

25:24.620 --> 25:26.451
Because I know
how this government operates.

25:27.956 --> 25:29.321
Yeah, I know I'm on a watch list.

25:29.491 --> 25:31.288
You know, people equate anarchy
with mayhem.

25:31.460 --> 25:33.291
And that's not true.

25:33.462 --> 25:35.862
I'm an advocate
of peaceful resistance.

25:36.799 --> 25:39.700
Well, this country
has a rich history of anarchy.

25:39.868 --> 25:41.301
Henry Thoreau was an anarchist.

25:41.470 --> 25:43.802
- Did you know that?
- I didn't know that. You know that?

25:43.972 --> 25:46.941
Robert Louis Stevenson thought
Thoreau was a girly man.

25:47.109 --> 25:48.633
He called him a skulker.

25:49.578 --> 25:50.875
A skulker.

25:51.880 --> 25:54.974
You spy on us with your satellites.

25:55.150 --> 25:57.209
You can turn on our cell phones
without us knowing.

25:57.386 --> 25:59.820
You take our photos.
You listen in on our conversations.

25:59.988 --> 26:01.649
Am I right?

26:03.359 --> 26:05.293
What can I say?

26:05.861 --> 26:07.021
You're right.

26:07.896 --> 26:09.727
That's old-school stuff.

26:09.898 --> 26:13.356
You've heard of Bluetooth, right?
You don't think they invented that

26:13.535 --> 26:17.130
just so you can talk to your mom
while you're driving, do you? No.

26:17.639 --> 26:20.301
Every time you put
that little earpiece in,

26:20.476 --> 26:24.207
we have remote access
to your temporal lobe.

26:24.980 --> 26:26.971
That's right, Ryan.

26:27.149 --> 26:31.586
It's like hooking up a fiber optic cable
into your cerebral cortex.

26:31.754 --> 26:34.746
We know what you're saying, what
you're seeing, what you're thinking.

26:35.190 --> 26:37.249
That's just the consumer model.

26:37.426 --> 26:39.087
We got a machine in the next room.

26:39.261 --> 26:41.491
It can suck out your memories.

26:41.663 --> 26:43.824
The only problem is,
once they're gone, they're gone.

26:43.999 --> 26:46.331
Ffft. Instant amnesia.

26:47.169 --> 26:50.263
Me, personally,
I think it's a bridge too far.

26:50.439 --> 26:52.202
But we're at war here.

26:52.374 --> 26:55.036
And it is a war on terror.

26:55.210 --> 26:58.270
And I think the guy that did this
has access to a dirty bomb,

26:58.714 --> 27:01.239
and I think you know where he is.

27:17.199 --> 27:20.862
- Where's he going?
- Oh, don't worry about it, kid.

27:21.036 --> 27:22.765
It hurts,
but you won't remember any of it.

27:22.938 --> 27:23.962
You can't do this.

27:24.173 --> 27:26.368
Come on, you said yourself
you know how we operate.

27:26.542 --> 27:29.238
Seriously,
I had nothing to do with this.

27:30.112 --> 27:32.205
The guy you're looking for
is Shepherd.

27:33.115 --> 27:34.173
Who's Shepherd?

27:35.050 --> 27:37.541
I don't know his last name.
He used to be in our group,

27:37.719 --> 27:40.882
but he started advocating militant
aggression so we booted him out.

27:41.056 --> 27:43.581
He formed his own group.
Propaganda of the Deed.

27:43.759 --> 27:46.922
- He talk about using dirty bombs?
- No, but I wouldn't put it past him.

27:47.095 --> 27:49.256
- Where do we find him?
- I don't know.

27:49.431 --> 27:52.264
That guy is way off the grid.

27:52.734 --> 27:55.168
The only way I ever contact him
is through his blog.

27:55.337 --> 27:59.000
This is Shepherd's blog site.
Propaganda of the Deed.

27:59.208 --> 28:02.109
Frighteningly enough, he appears
to have a fair amount of followers.

28:02.277 --> 28:05.678
He's advocating violence as a means
for social change spurned on

28:05.848 --> 28:08.408
in part by the revolutions going on
in the Middle East.

28:08.584 --> 28:11.109
The website is hosted
outside the country.

28:11.286 --> 28:14.119
And he uploads his blogs
by Internet cafés.

28:14.289 --> 28:16.334
He's doing a pretty good job
of shielding his identity.

28:16.358 --> 28:18.588
Well, he's advocating
the use of militant action,

28:18.760 --> 28:21.820
but my guess is that
he has no military experience.

28:21.997 --> 28:23.487
He can espouse
the use of dirty bombs.

28:23.665 --> 28:25.929
Hell, he can buy the materials
on the black market,

28:26.101 --> 28:27.830
but he doesn't know
how to go about it.

28:28.003 --> 28:30.335
That's where Brent comes in.
He's pretending to be a SEAL.

28:30.506 --> 28:32.303
Shepherd's pretending to be
a revolutionary.

28:32.474 --> 28:33.668
It's a match made in heaven.

28:33.842 --> 28:36.333
Until Brent Dundas can't deliver
on that bomb, or refuses to,

28:36.512 --> 28:39.276
when he realizes what a wing nut
Shepherd is, you've got game over.

28:39.448 --> 28:41.780
Okay, so how do we smoke out
this psychopath

28:41.950 --> 28:43.315
before he actually succeeds?

28:43.485 --> 28:46.045
Shepherd may still be looking
for someone who can make a bomb.

28:46.255 --> 28:49.452
Maybe it's time we introduce him
to a real Navy SEAL.

28:49.892 --> 28:52.019
No. No way.

28:52.194 --> 28:53.388
We're running out of time.

28:53.562 --> 28:55.621
Our best bet
is to draw Shepherd out.

28:55.797 --> 28:57.788
And the best way to do that
is to use me as bait.

28:57.966 --> 28:59.661
Ask Ryan Long to set up a meet

28:59.835 --> 29:01.666
and help coordinate
the long-awaited uprising.

29:01.837 --> 29:04.772
With you as the newest weapon
to support the cause?

29:05.474 --> 29:08.500
We're gonna have to be prepared
to deal with a potential dirty bomb.

29:08.677 --> 29:09.837
Okay.

29:10.012 --> 29:12.810
I'll round up detection, protection
and containment gear.

29:20.722 --> 29:22.519
Ah. Hetty, what are you doing?

29:22.691 --> 29:26.491
Oh, just a little spring-cleaning.

29:26.662 --> 29:28.186
What's the word on Shepherd?

29:28.363 --> 29:31.196
Well, we're setting the trap.
I just hope that he takes the bait.

29:31.366 --> 29:32.697
Well, be careful.

29:32.868 --> 29:36.497
There's nothing as dangerous
as a trapped animal.

29:38.006 --> 29:39.064
True.

29:39.241 --> 29:42.733
Here, I have something for you.

29:43.412 --> 29:45.346
Oh. Wow.

29:45.514 --> 29:50.349
I had it custom-made to look
like the one I used on Bette Davis

29:50.519 --> 29:51.918
in Death on the Nile.

29:52.854 --> 29:54.879
I can't take that, Hetty. I'm sorry.

29:55.057 --> 29:56.854
Oh, I insist.

29:57.025 --> 29:58.925
But be careful.

30:02.598 --> 30:05.396
Oh, that is the coolest thing
I've ever seen.

30:05.934 --> 30:08.266
I figured you'd like it.

30:08.570 --> 30:14.065
Like you,
it's both feminine and deadly.

30:15.277 --> 30:19.077
Therein lies its true value.

30:19.781 --> 30:21.976
You think I'm feminine and deadly?

30:22.918 --> 30:25.580
Among many things.

30:26.221 --> 30:28.985
It's what makes you so good
at this job.

30:31.560 --> 30:35.394
The true challenge
is knowing when to stop.

30:36.965 --> 30:38.330
What do you mean?

30:38.500 --> 30:39.990
The job.

30:40.168 --> 30:43.660
The importance of what we do,
the excitement of doing it.

30:43.872 --> 30:48.002
It makes it very difficult to give up.

30:49.177 --> 30:51.509
When the day comes for you
to hang up your gun...

30:51.680 --> 30:53.671
- Oh...
- And it will.

30:53.882 --> 30:55.144
You're going to wanna come home

30:55.317 --> 30:58.150
to something more than a collection
of antique weapons.

30:58.320 --> 31:01.619
Unfortunately, most of the guys
that I meet...

31:01.957 --> 31:04.687
are trying to shoot me, so...

31:04.893 --> 31:06.758
Not to worry.

31:06.928 --> 31:12.764
Sometimes you find them,
sometimes they find you.

31:12.934 --> 31:16.597
You just have
to keep your eyes open.

31:20.475 --> 31:23.638
- Enjoy that.
- Thank you.

31:25.013 --> 31:27.174
- Detective.
- Hetty.

31:27.416 --> 31:29.316
- I thought you were getting the gear.
- I am.

31:29.484 --> 31:33.011
Are you? Because that looks a lot
like a makeup brush.

31:33.188 --> 31:35.816
You putting on
some radiation-proof foundation?

31:35.991 --> 31:38.858
You got a little lead-lined mascara
in there?

31:39.027 --> 31:41.359
No, it's just something
Hetty's getting rid of.

31:41.530 --> 31:44.988
- Really?
- Yeah, but you have to be careful...

31:47.736 --> 31:49.135
You two scare me.

31:50.939 --> 31:52.429
Good.

31:58.313 --> 32:00.338
Could you try not to act so nervous?

32:01.450 --> 32:05.216
- I am nervous.
- Then think about something else.

32:05.554 --> 32:08.274
All I can think about is the picture
of the burned guy you showed me.

32:08.457 --> 32:10.357
You know,
you'd be doing me a favor

32:10.525 --> 32:12.015
if you could erase that memory.

32:12.194 --> 32:14.025
Deeks, Kensi, you in position?

32:14.196 --> 32:16.926
Yeah. You guys wanna bring me
some chicken tenders?

32:17.099 --> 32:18.259
Not really.

32:18.467 --> 32:20.526
Do you wanna get Deeks
some chicken tenders, Sam?

32:20.702 --> 32:22.192
Sure, if he makes himself useful

32:22.370 --> 32:24.031
and washes my car
while he's out there.

32:24.206 --> 32:26.902
Hold up, we got someone
coming your way.

32:29.211 --> 32:31.076
Drew, what are you doing here?

32:31.246 --> 32:32.611
Shepherd sent me.

32:33.081 --> 32:34.878
What is this?
I thought Shepherd was coming.

32:35.050 --> 32:37.541
It's just for security purposes.

32:38.286 --> 32:40.914
Shepherd just has
some questions first.

32:48.730 --> 32:49.754
Shepherd.

32:49.931 --> 32:51.922
I'm here. Get on with it.

32:52.100 --> 32:54.261
Eric, Shepherd sent a proxy.

32:54.436 --> 32:55.630
He's got him on the phone.

32:55.804 --> 32:58.034
We're already trying to trace it.

32:58.440 --> 33:00.874
What SEAL team were you in?

33:03.145 --> 33:07.741
DEVGRU, formerly SEAL Team 6,
out of Dam Neck, Virginia.

33:08.784 --> 33:12.914
- What's unique about SEAL Team 2?
- Seriously?

33:15.157 --> 33:16.954
Arctic warfare capability.

33:17.125 --> 33:19.093
Can I try Famous Battles for 200?

33:19.261 --> 33:21.627
Just answer the questions.

33:22.964 --> 33:25.091
Who is Harry Constance?

33:28.336 --> 33:31.772
He was a Vietnam-era Navy SEAL
who completed over 300 missions.

33:31.940 --> 33:33.635
All of which
you could find on Wikipedia.

33:33.809 --> 33:37.301
We were here to blow something up,
not to play Trivial Pursuit.

33:37.479 --> 33:38.810
That's enough, Drew.

33:38.980 --> 33:41.244
Take me off speakerphone.

33:43.285 --> 33:45.810
- Take this outside.
- Excuse me.

33:48.323 --> 33:49.813
Eric, how we doing on that trace?

33:49.991 --> 33:51.754
We're closing in. He's nearby.

33:51.927 --> 33:54.259
The call's coming from a landline.

33:57.799 --> 33:58.823
What's he doing?

33:59.000 --> 34:00.934
Sam, Callen, he's running away.

34:05.207 --> 34:06.765
He left without his bag. Go. Go. Go.

34:06.942 --> 34:08.204
Everybody out of the bar, now!

34:08.376 --> 34:10.606
Come on. Get out of the bar. Go.

34:18.032 --> 34:19.192
Stay down!

34:38.105 --> 34:39.902
We're just lucky
no one was injured.

34:40.074 --> 34:41.371
I'll keep digging

34:41.542 --> 34:43.652
to see what else I can find
on your bomb delivery boy.

34:43.677 --> 34:45.007
I'll call if we catch some fish.

34:45.179 --> 34:47.409
Make sure you let Hetty know
it was not a dirty bomb.

34:47.581 --> 34:49.014
Will do.

34:49.248 --> 34:50.944
The guy's name is Drew Stetson.

34:51.118 --> 34:52.710
He's a runaway
and all-around misfit.

34:52.886 --> 34:54.911
He's got a warrant for
a misdemeanor in Arizona.

34:55.089 --> 34:58.115
It's gonna be the least of his worries
now. California Penal Code 12308:

34:58.325 --> 35:01.123
Attempted murder with
an explosive device is a life sentence.

35:01.328 --> 35:03.319
Thank you, counselor.

35:04.031 --> 35:05.089
According to our boy here,

35:05.265 --> 35:07.790
Shepherd wanted to blow up Ryan
to set an example.

35:07.968 --> 35:09.731
He also confirmed Shepherd
has a dirty bomb

35:09.903 --> 35:11.131
and he's determined to use it.

35:11.338 --> 35:12.771
I don't suppose he knows where.

35:12.940 --> 35:14.874
Shepherd will reveal
when the time is right.

35:15.042 --> 35:17.272
Maybe Eric will get lucky
with his phone trace.

35:19.880 --> 35:22.542
It was a payphone, there wasn't
a surveillance, ATM or traffic cam

35:22.716 --> 35:24.650
within about a quarter of a mile.

35:24.918 --> 35:26.715
Shepherd just posted to his blog.

35:26.887 --> 35:28.878
It's essentially a call to arms.

35:29.056 --> 35:32.287
He's trying to incite his followers
into a violent revolt

35:32.459 --> 35:34.723
against what he sees
as a corrupt government.

35:34.895 --> 35:35.987
He's delusional.

35:36.163 --> 35:37.425
He's also armed and dangerous.

35:37.598 --> 35:39.793
He already killed one person
and he tried to kill us.

35:39.967 --> 35:41.662
We know he has
the radiopharmaceuticals,

35:41.869 --> 35:43.166
he's learned how to make a bomb.

35:43.370 --> 35:44.462
Got a lot of followers.

35:44.638 --> 35:47.232
It only takes one nut job
to encourage copycat behavior.

35:47.407 --> 35:50.433
"The spark that will ignite
the revolution will be set today."

35:50.878 --> 35:52.505
They want it to be symbolic.

35:52.679 --> 35:56.171
And for it to be effective, he'll need
those radiopharmaceuticals in the air.

35:56.683 --> 36:00.312
Well, keep looking for Shepherd
and a list of possible targets.

36:07.895 --> 36:09.760
You avoiding me?

36:10.531 --> 36:14.490
If I wanted to avoid you, Mr. Callen,
you wouldn't find me.

36:14.668 --> 36:15.794
What's going on, Hetty?

36:15.969 --> 36:18.028
Oh, many things.

36:18.205 --> 36:20.765
Perhaps you should be
more specific.

36:28.048 --> 36:30.016
I have to flinch first, is that it?

36:32.052 --> 36:34.680
Fine. I got a nut job running
around the city with a dirty bomb.

36:34.855 --> 36:37.449
He's already tried to kill us.
You haven't weighed in on this.

36:37.624 --> 36:39.649
I have alerted the NEST Teams.

36:39.826 --> 36:41.953
And apprised the local authorities

36:42.129 --> 36:45.189
of the appropriate
emergency protocols.

36:46.833 --> 36:48.198
Thank you.

36:48.635 --> 36:51.468
Is there something else
you think I should be doing?

36:51.738 --> 36:53.137
I don't know.

36:53.307 --> 36:55.867
Well, I think you've got it covered,
Mr. Callen.

36:56.043 --> 36:57.977
If I didn't...

36:58.312 --> 36:59.836
I'd tell you.

37:00.013 --> 37:01.708
That's good to know.

37:04.251 --> 37:06.845
Being in charge sucks, Mr. Callen.

37:07.454 --> 37:11.754
Everyone looks to you
for guidance and answers,

37:11.959 --> 37:14.951
even when you have none to give.

37:15.495 --> 37:18.953
Well, I've never known you
to ever be at a loss for words.

37:19.666 --> 37:23.102
The true test of a commander

37:23.270 --> 37:27.036
is when he is as frightened
and confused

37:27.207 --> 37:29.402
as those who look up to him.

37:29.576 --> 37:34.878
In that moment,
when you can't find it in yourself...

37:35.582 --> 37:39.018
you will find it in them.

37:40.220 --> 37:41.881
That's leadership.

37:45.926 --> 37:49.054
G., initially we thought Shepherd
would go after a hard target,

37:49.229 --> 37:51.459
like a federal building
or a courthouse.

37:51.632 --> 37:56.126
There's a rally today in
Pershing Square to support the troops.

37:59.139 --> 38:03.974
It's symbolic,
easy access, lot of people.

38:04.144 --> 38:06.442
Best chance of escape.

38:08.048 --> 38:10.710
All right, Monty. It's go time.

38:10.884 --> 38:11.908
Come on, buddy.

38:15.555 --> 38:18.888
- Hey, Monty.
- Well, well, look who's back.

38:20.027 --> 38:21.460
What the hell is that?

38:21.628 --> 38:23.459
For your information,
he had to have surgery.

38:23.630 --> 38:24.756
Poor thing.

38:24.931 --> 38:27.422
Listen, if there's a bomb here,
Monty will sniff it out.

38:27.601 --> 38:28.727
Good boy, Monty.

38:28.902 --> 38:30.836
You sure that's a police dog,
not a lab specimen?

38:31.038 --> 38:33.506
Seriously, Deeks, at least
get him a pair of pants, all right?

38:33.674 --> 38:36.609
Just ignore them, Monty.
They're jealous of me too.

38:36.777 --> 38:38.438
All right, find the bomb.

38:39.913 --> 38:42.006
Come on, brother, this side first.

38:42.182 --> 38:43.774
No, no.

38:44.851 --> 38:46.284
Here we go.

38:46.453 --> 38:48.614
Wanna check here?
Come on, let's go.

38:57.431 --> 39:00.161
Sam, check out Johnny Guitar.

39:10.177 --> 39:12.873
Guys, I think I found something.

39:18.085 --> 39:19.814
False alarm.

39:20.287 --> 39:22.118
What do you got, buddy?

39:23.824 --> 39:26.019
- Well, sure.
- Yeah, why not?

39:26.193 --> 39:28.491
Hey, fellow, how you doing?

39:32.532 --> 39:35.000
I told you it's just a guitar.

39:38.138 --> 39:40.038
Wanna tell me
what you're looking for?

39:40.207 --> 39:41.606
Sorry, pal.

39:49.883 --> 39:51.214
Must be something good in there.

39:53.387 --> 39:54.649
I got him. Public Works, guys.

39:54.821 --> 39:56.755
L.A.P. D! Everybody out of the area!

39:56.923 --> 39:58.356
Guys, it's a trash can.

40:01.828 --> 40:03.728
Everybody down. Out of the way!

40:10.437 --> 40:12.496
All right, Shepherd.

40:13.840 --> 40:16.570
- Up.
- You haven't stopped anything.

40:16.743 --> 40:19.439
I'm just one of thousands.
The resistance is growing.

40:19.646 --> 40:22.672
And soon, your authoritarian
oppression will come crumbling down.

40:22.849 --> 40:25.113
You know what they call anarchists
in prison, Shepherd?

40:25.285 --> 40:26.547
Shower toys.

40:36.797 --> 40:38.662
Let's let the bomb squad do this.

40:39.099 --> 40:41.033
- I'm trained for this. I can do it.
- You are.

40:41.201 --> 40:44.102
And you're very good at it,
but they're already here.

40:46.907 --> 40:49.398
It'd be a shame to make them
put those suits on for nothing.

40:49.576 --> 40:52.238
Yeah. And, you know,
it probably wouldn't hurt

40:52.412 --> 40:54.573
if we picked up the pace
just a little bit.

40:58.752 --> 41:01.778
One day, Sam,
this dog will save your life.

41:01.955 --> 41:04.389
And I think somebody owes Monty
an apology.

41:04.558 --> 41:08.119
- Okay, nice work, mutt.
- That's not very nice.

41:08.295 --> 41:11.287
- I was talking to Deeks.
- Thanks.

41:11.465 --> 41:14.730
Hey, a sailboat sounds pretty good
about now, doesn't it?

41:16.303 --> 41:18.498
Yo, you okay?

41:19.005 --> 41:20.336
Yeah, I was just thinking.

41:20.507 --> 41:21.974
About what?

41:22.142 --> 41:25.407
Something Hetty said.
I'm worried about her.

41:25.579 --> 41:26.910
She's worried about you.

41:27.080 --> 41:28.513
Why would she be worried
about me?

41:28.715 --> 41:31.445
You can be a worrisome guy.

41:32.352 --> 41:34.513
She pulled me aside
and wanted to talk about it today.

41:34.721 --> 41:35.813
Me too.

41:36.323 --> 41:38.416
But not about you.

41:38.592 --> 41:40.753
We had a real heart-to-heart today
about the future.

41:41.094 --> 41:43.119
Me three.
She's talking about things changing.

41:44.364 --> 41:46.332
Guys, she's putting her affairs
in order.

41:49.769 --> 41:51.168
Hetty?

41:51.338 --> 41:52.532
I've been calling you.

41:52.739 --> 41:54.604
- I'm sorry.
- Why didn't you answer my calls?

41:54.774 --> 41:58.972
- Where is she?
- Miss Lange? She's gone.

41:59.679 --> 42:01.670
She tendered her resignation...

42:02.782 --> 42:04.147
effective immediately.

42:05.752 --> 42:06.810
Who are you?

42:07.821 --> 42:10.449
Lauren Hunter. Her replacement.

42:11.791 --> 42:12.815
Her replacement?

42:12.993 --> 42:14.153
Is this a joke?

42:14.794 --> 42:17.524
I'm not much of a joker, Agent Blye.

42:18.698 --> 42:21.394
- Nell, get me Dir. Vance on the phone.
- That won't be necessary.

42:22.269 --> 42:27.263
Director Vance is coming online
in Ops to brief you all momentarily.

42:28.141 --> 42:29.540
Agent Callen,

42:29.709 --> 42:33.372
I'd like to have a word with you
in my office when you're finished.

42:58.733 --> 43:00.223
Hey. Hey.
