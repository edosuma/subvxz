00:13.541 --> 00:19.125


00:19.208 --> 00:22.416


00:22.500 --> 00:25.625


00:57.125 --> 01:00.500


01:20.583 --> 01:21.708


01:50.791 --> 01:52.708
Cuphead! Mugman!

01:52.791 --> 01:54.291
Yes, Elder Kettle?

01:54.375 --> 01:57.833
Today, you two are in for a real treat!

01:57.916 --> 01:59.416
Really?

01:59.500 --> 02:02.875
You get to paint the fence!

02:08.916 --> 02:12.791
Jeez. I guess we know
what we're doing the rest of the day, huh?

02:12.875 --> 02:14.583
Oh, banana oil!

02:14.666 --> 02:17.666
Paint the fence,
milk the goat, patch the roof!

02:17.750 --> 02:19.791
It's the same old stuff every day!

02:19.875 --> 02:22.583
What we need
is a little fun and adventure.

02:22.666 --> 02:24.833
If we could only speed things up,

02:24.916 --> 02:28.791
maybe we'd have time to squeeze in
a little fun and adventure at the end.

02:28.875 --> 02:30.708
Way ahead of you, pal.

02:33.208 --> 02:35.125
Hey, boys, how's that--

02:37.916 --> 02:39.833
Boy, was he steamed.

02:39.916 --> 02:42.000
Eh. I ain't too worried about it.

02:42.083 --> 02:44.083
You know, that should have worked.

02:44.166 --> 02:47.333
If only I used a little less gunpowder…

02:47.875 --> 02:48.708
Oh, well.

02:48.791 --> 02:51.166
Let's just focus on getting more paint.

02:51.250 --> 02:53.041
And try not to get distracted.

02:53.125 --> 02:55.416
Mugman! Look!

02:58.625 --> 03:00.708
Um, Cuphead, I'm not so sure--

03:00.791 --> 03:04.250
You know what I do when I'm not so sure?
I double down!

03:05.333 --> 03:06.833
What does that even mean?

03:06.916 --> 03:09.291
It means we're going to that carnival!

03:09.375 --> 03:11.375
Absolutely not!

03:11.458 --> 03:13.000
There's no way we're go--

03:26.125 --> 03:28.208
I've gotta hand it to you, Cuphead.

03:28.291 --> 03:29.583
That was great!

03:29.666 --> 03:32.916
And we still have time
to get supplies and fix the fen--

03:33.791 --> 03:34.625
Cuphead?

03:37.416 --> 03:39.875


03:48.333 --> 03:49.750
<i>-Winner!</i>

03:49.833 --> 03:51.125
Ha-ha!

03:52.333 --> 03:53.625
<i>-Winner!</i>

03:53.708 --> 03:55.291
Eh? Eh?

03:57.375 --> 03:58.583
<i>-Winner!</i>

04:00.916 --> 04:02.000
<i>-Winner!</i>

04:02.958 --> 04:04.250
<i>-Winner!</i>

04:05.083 --> 04:06.083

-Huh?

04:06.166 --> 04:07.333
<i>-Winner!</i>

04:08.083 --> 04:09.125
<i>-Winner!</i>
-Oh?

04:15.041 --> 04:15.958
<i>-Winner!</i>

04:35.541 --> 04:37.083
"Soul Ball."

04:45.791 --> 04:47.291
"Carnival."

04:47.375 --> 04:48.916
"Carn-Evil."

04:49.000 --> 04:50.500
"Evil"?!

04:51.916 --> 04:52.750
Uh…

04:52.833 --> 04:56.000
-Cuphead?
-Not now, Mugsy! I'm on a hot streak.

04:56.750 --> 04:57.791
<i>-Winner!</i>

05:06.250 --> 05:09.166
Everyone loves a carnival.

05:10.291 --> 05:11.583
What a haul.

05:57.541 --> 06:01.833


06:11.500 --> 06:13.375
Uh, hey, boss.

06:14.166 --> 06:15.000
Boss!

06:16.166 --> 06:17.291
Hey, boss!

06:17.375 --> 06:19.541
What?! I was singing!

06:19.625 --> 06:20.666
The…

06:20.750 --> 06:22.833
the soul counter stopped.

06:30.666 --> 06:31.541
What the--

06:43.000 --> 06:44.291
<i>-Winner!</i>

06:44.375 --> 06:47.916
Cuphead! Cuphead! Cuphead!

06:49.000 --> 06:52.125
Terrific. Looks like
we have a real show-off.

06:54.708 --> 06:57.708
Cuphead, maybe you should quit
while you're ahead.

06:57.791 --> 06:58.916
Double down!

07:01.541 --> 07:02.458
Oh!

07:02.541 --> 07:03.791
<i>-Winner!</i>

07:04.958 --> 07:05.958
Thank you!

07:10.583 --> 07:12.375
The Devil!

07:17.208 --> 07:19.458
My fans. They love me.

07:27.208 --> 07:28.583
Hello.

07:31.375 --> 07:32.208
Cup--

07:32.875 --> 07:34.000
-Cuphead!
-Watch it!

07:35.833 --> 07:37.458
<i>Loser!</i>

07:38.458 --> 07:39.666
Aw, heck.

07:39.750 --> 07:41.666
Now look at what you made me do!

07:45.291 --> 07:47.875
And that's game.

07:49.666 --> 07:50.958
Whoa!

08:00.916 --> 08:03.125
Run!

08:05.208 --> 08:07.875
Ooh, I love it when they run.

08:10.416 --> 08:14.458
I'm sorry I made you miss!
This is all my fault!

08:14.541 --> 08:19.333
We should've never have come here
in the first place! It's all my fault!

08:19.416 --> 08:22.083
You're right! It <i>is</i> your fault!

08:30.041 --> 08:31.458
I think we lost him.

08:31.541 --> 08:32.708
Surprise!

08:32.791 --> 08:33.625
Huh?

08:40.041 --> 08:41.708
Whoa!

08:41.791 --> 08:43.333
Bad horsey! Whoa!

09:04.625 --> 09:06.416
Whoa! Whoa!

09:14.041 --> 09:16.666


09:21.750 --> 09:22.583
Whoa!

09:32.666 --> 09:35.625
Come on, Cuphead!
It's time for a double down!

09:35.708 --> 09:36.958
What are you, nuts?!

09:39.916 --> 09:43.125
-Now pretend like we're cornered!
-We <i>are</i> cornered!

09:46.166 --> 09:47.041


09:49.250 --> 09:50.416
Jump!

10:04.208 --> 10:06.833
No!

10:08.375 --> 10:10.000
-Yay!

10:25.458 --> 10:28.666
You don't just get to run away.

10:31.083 --> 10:34.791
Wow, boss. I never saw
you let no one escape before.

10:34.875 --> 10:36.458
He didn't escape!

10:36.541 --> 10:38.750
He played the game. He lost.

10:38.833 --> 10:41.250
His soul belongs to me.

10:41.333 --> 10:43.583
I'll get that cup.

10:44.125 --> 10:44.958
Head?

10:45.541 --> 10:46.458
Oh, shut up.

10:52.416 --> 10:54.625
What an amazing day. We rode rides.

10:54.708 --> 10:56.416
You owe the Devil your soul.

10:56.500 --> 10:59.625
-We played games.
-And you owe the Devil your soul.

10:59.708 --> 11:01.666
We're almost finished
with this dumb fence!

11:01.750 --> 11:04.416
And you owe the Devil your soul!

11:05.000 --> 11:06.958
Eh. I ain't too worried about it.

11:08.083 --> 11:09.625
Hey, boys, how--

11:12.125 --> 11:14.250
Still too much gunpowder.

11:14.333 --> 11:16.875
And you still owe the Devil your soul.
