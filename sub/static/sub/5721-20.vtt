00:03.780 --> 00:06.772
["Wave of Mutilation"
by Rhett Miller playing]

00:29.500 --> 00:32.845
And what do you want?

00:32.900 --> 00:34.891
You.

00:36.940 --> 00:39.295
You're not getting divorced
because of me?

00:39.340 --> 00:41.035
No.

00:43.210 --> 00:44.199
No.

00:46.910 --> 00:49.299
Because...

00:49.350 --> 00:50.647
that would be
a bad idea.

00:50.700 --> 00:53.783
Why?

00:53.830 --> 00:55.821
Because I don't know
what we are yet.

00:55.880 --> 00:58.303
Well, I don't either,

00:58.360 --> 01:01.181
but I'm through
delaying anything.

01:01.230 --> 01:05.439
I've looked back at my life,
and every time

01:05.500 --> 01:07.104
I didn't say something I meant

01:07.150 --> 01:08.492
or waited for a better moment...

01:08.540 --> 01:09.495
[knocking on door]

01:09.540 --> 01:12.418
[sighs]

01:12.460 --> 01:14.018
I-I should go anyway.

01:14.070 --> 01:15.412
No, you're staying.

01:15.460 --> 01:17.416
And they can just wait
until I'm done.

01:17.460 --> 01:21.544
There is no better moment.

01:21.600 --> 01:24.296
That's the one thing--
the only thing I've discovered.

01:24.340 --> 01:25.989
Everything comes to an end.

01:26.040 --> 01:27.428
There's no better moment
than now.

01:27.470 --> 01:28.687
[knocking on door]

01:28.740 --> 01:30.423
GRACE: Mom, I need your help
with the flowers.

01:30.480 --> 01:32.163
[laughs]

01:34.790 --> 01:36.599
Alicia,

01:36.660 --> 01:37.877
we will talk.

01:41.490 --> 01:42.912
Okay.

01:42.970 --> 01:45.484
[clears throat]

01:48.190 --> 01:49.623
What's that?

01:49.670 --> 01:50.659
Um...

01:50.710 --> 01:54.362
It's just a--
it's a little present.

01:54.410 --> 01:57.755
Really, it...

01:57.810 --> 01:58.845
it's nothing.

02:00.680 --> 02:02.409
No, no, it...

02:02.470 --> 02:03.596
I'm sorry, it...

02:06.340 --> 02:07.819
...really is nothing.

02:07.860 --> 02:11.125
It's a deed to
some land on Mars.

02:12.950 --> 02:14.292
They're selling it online,

02:14.350 --> 02:18.081
so you own 500 acres
in the Valles Marineris.

02:18.130 --> 02:19.654
[knocking on door]

02:19.700 --> 02:21.691
GRACE: Seriously, Mom,
I can't get them all in.

02:21.750 --> 02:23.911
It was meant to be a joke.

02:23.960 --> 02:27.225
I'm sorry.
Here.

02:27.270 --> 02:29.261
Mom!

02:29.320 --> 02:31.572
I will call you.

02:41.240 --> 02:45.597
Wow, that is a lot of flowers.

02:45.640 --> 02:47.460
Hey, Jason.
Hi.

02:47.510 --> 02:49.558
Do you want me to help
you bring these in?

02:49.600 --> 02:51.682
Oh, no, thanks,
I think we're sending them back.

02:51.730 --> 02:53.516
Mom, the florist
sent us funeral flowers.

02:53.560 --> 02:56.290
They got our order mixed
up with somebody else.

02:56.350 --> 02:57.738
JASON:
Okay, uh...

02:57.780 --> 02:59.600
Good luck.
Have a great party.

02:59.650 --> 03:01.083
GRACE:
Thanks, bye.

03:01.130 --> 03:03.086
Mom, they said that they
knocked, but nobody answered,

03:03.130 --> 03:04.563
so they just left them here.

03:04.610 --> 03:06.521
I think they knew they
were the wrong ones.

03:06.570 --> 03:08.299
Mom?

03:12.060 --> 03:14.096
Oh, my gosh, those
arefuneral flowers.

03:14.150 --> 03:15.481
What are we gonna do?

03:15.540 --> 03:17.622
I told them that it was
for Grandma and Howard's...

03:17.670 --> 03:18.625
what's it called?

03:18.670 --> 03:19.625
A ketubah signing.

03:19.670 --> 03:20.978
It's like a wedding contract.

03:21.020 --> 03:22.749
Right, I think I called it
a wedding reception.

03:22.810 --> 03:24.414
Well, we have an hour.

03:24.460 --> 03:28.066
I have to get myself changed,
get the food out, decorate.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.372
Let's get these inside and
then you call the florist.

03:30.420 --> 03:32.115
You don't think we could pass
them off as celebratory, can we?

03:32.160 --> 03:33.639
Like white for spring?

03:33.690 --> 03:35.373
It would be funny if we try.

03:35.430 --> 03:37.421
I don't think funny's
what we're going for.

03:41.090 --> 03:43.081
[phones ringing,
indistinct chatter]

03:51.310 --> 03:53.266
[door closes]

03:53.320 --> 03:54.571
Exactly the man I wanted to see.

03:54.620 --> 03:56.531
I thought I was meeting
with Mike.

03:56.580 --> 03:59.094
You were. Things
have changed.

03:59.150 --> 04:01.015
Ignore me, this is Dad's thing.Yeah, put your earbuds in.

04:01.060 --> 04:02.539
[scoffs]This is going to trial.

04:02.590 --> 04:04.319
I know.

04:04.370 --> 04:06.588
The governor doesn't want
you to work on his case.

04:06.630 --> 04:08.894
And part of our strategy
is built on a speedy trial.

04:08.940 --> 04:10.714
Uh, Peter needs to
get back to work

04:10.770 --> 04:12.544
and he can't do
that with this...

04:12.600 --> 04:13.544
Cloud?

04:13.600 --> 04:14.726
Yes, yes, with this cloud

04:14.770 --> 04:18.638
hanging over him, so...

04:18.690 --> 04:20.112
I need your help.

04:20.170 --> 04:23.424
You know I'm not
the best person to do this.

04:23.480 --> 04:24.424
Yes, I do,

04:24.480 --> 04:27.904
and that is why I need you.

04:27.960 --> 04:32.169
I want you to prove
that Peter is guilty.

04:32.220 --> 04:33.619
Why?

04:33.660 --> 04:36.265
We're being offered a
plea bargain by the AUSA.

04:36.310 --> 04:37.527
It makes no sense.

04:37.580 --> 04:38.615
Three years in prison?

04:38.660 --> 04:40.400
The evidence doesn't support it.

04:40.450 --> 04:43.089
Get the discovery.I did, and I'm not
getting a straight answer

04:43.150 --> 04:44.310
from Peter's investigators--

04:44.370 --> 04:45.314
they're being far
too deferential--

04:45.370 --> 04:47.930
so I need you to be tough.

04:47.980 --> 04:50.141
Show me why he's guilty.

04:59.690 --> 05:02.204
[sighs]

05:13.960 --> 05:15.780
Hey, food's here.
What's that?

05:15.830 --> 05:16.819
Uh, nothing.

05:16.880 --> 05:18.529
Any luck with the flowers?

05:18.570 --> 05:19.912
No, they said
that it's our fault.

05:19.970 --> 05:22.313
That we've ordered
the bereavement array.

05:22.360 --> 05:24.408
I said that there's a_ funeral
somewhere that's getting flowers

05:24.450 --> 05:26.406
that say, "Congratulations,
Howard and Jackie."

05:26.450 --> 05:27.405
[both laugh]

05:27.450 --> 05:28.439
You look really pretty.

05:28.500 --> 05:30.013
Why, thank you.
So do you.

05:30.060 --> 05:31.015
Thank you.

05:31.060 --> 05:32.015
Let me see that.
What is it?

05:32.070 --> 05:33.321
Oh, it's nothing.

05:36.680 --> 05:40.150
It's a deed to land on Mars.

05:40.200 --> 05:42.282
Why do you have a deed
to land on Mars?

05:42.340 --> 05:44.240
[chuckles]

05:44.300 --> 05:46.029
I have no idea.

05:46.080 --> 05:47.775
It was a gift.

05:47.820 --> 05:50.380
What, from a 13-year-old?

05:50.430 --> 05:52.512
Or 12.
Maybe he was 12 years old.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.084
"The Florrick Homestead."

05:54.130 --> 05:55.438
[both chuckle]
Yeah.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.868
Pretty weird gift, isn't it?

05:56.920 --> 05:58.876
Yeah, who gave it to you?

05:58.920 --> 06:00.524
Someone from work.

06:00.570 --> 06:03.038
I mean, 500 acres.

06:03.100 --> 06:05.261
That's a lot of acres.

06:05.320 --> 06:06.355
You're right.

06:06.400 --> 06:09.016
It could've been 50 acres.

06:09.060 --> 06:10.618
You could ranch there.

06:10.670 --> 06:12.399
I could raise a family.

06:12.450 --> 06:15.669
[both laugh]

06:15.720 --> 06:17.062
ZACH:
Hello? Mom?

06:17.110 --> 06:19.419
[gaSPSJ

06:20.460 --> 06:23.281
Aw. Thank you.

06:23.330 --> 06:24.285
For what?

06:24.340 --> 06:26.683
For coming home for this.

06:26.730 --> 06:27.981
And for wearing a tie.

06:28.030 --> 06:29.770
It was a long weekend.

06:29.820 --> 06:31.071
How's Grandma doing?She's happy.

06:31.120 --> 06:33.076
Good.

06:33.130 --> 06:35.473
Grace, hey.
Hey.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.033
We have funeral flowers.

06:37.090 --> 06:38.910
We do.
Why?

06:38.960 --> 06:41.428
Well, we thought we'd go
a different way.

06:41.480 --> 06:43.084
Okay, the guests are
coming in ten minutes.

06:43.140 --> 06:44.869
Let's try and pull
this together.

06:44.920 --> 06:46.091
So, I have
a surprise for you, Mom.

06:46.140 --> 06:48.096
Oh, is it a deed
to land on Mars?

06:48.140 --> 06:49.960
What?
ALICIA:
Nothing.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.830
Your sister's in a funny mood.

06:51.880 --> 06:53.051
What's the surprise?

06:53.100 --> 06:54.442
I can't tell you yet.

06:54.500 --> 06:55.922
You're flunking out.

06:55.980 --> 06:57.459
No.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.627
[snoring]

07:01.370 --> 07:03.543
You were snoring.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.319
Do we have a meeting?
Nope.

07:05.380 --> 07:08.338
Just dropped by.

07:08.380 --> 07:09.335
Here.

07:09.380 --> 07:10.631
It's a donut.

07:14.170 --> 07:17.424
I have another five hours
of work tonight, Jason.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.380
Whatever you want,

07:19.430 --> 07:20.988
can we do this another time?

07:21.040 --> 07:21.995
Governor Florrick.

07:22.050 --> 07:24.041
You?

07:24.090 --> 07:25.478
They must be paying you well.

07:25.530 --> 07:26.565
Did he do it?

07:26.620 --> 07:28.349
You mean did he tank
my prosecution

07:28.400 --> 07:30.743
in order to satisfy
one of his donors?

07:30.790 --> 07:32.439
Sure, let's start with that.You tell me.

07:32.490 --> 07:33.741
I had a strong case.

07:33.800 --> 07:36.837
Richard Locke shoots
his girlfriend Patty

07:36.890 --> 07:37.959
when she comes home one night.

07:38.020 --> 07:40.488
Two bullets in the chest.

07:40.540 --> 07:43.236
Look at the crime scene photos.

07:43.280 --> 07:45.066
Poor woman bled out.

07:45.110 --> 07:46.930
How was the scene?
Untouched.

07:46.980 --> 07:49.244
Locke said he didn't do it,

07:49.290 --> 07:50.678
but he was covered in blood.

07:53.030 --> 07:54.554
Who ran the case?

07:54.600 --> 07:56.989
A detective from the 32nd.

07:57.040 --> 07:59.383
Uh... Crowell.

07:59.430 --> 08:00.385
Rick Crowell?

08:00.430 --> 08:02.034
I know him.

08:02.090 --> 08:03.739
Yeah, he's not a cowboy.

08:03.780 --> 08:04.997
So it was a slam-dunk case.

08:05.040 --> 08:06.826
Till Peter got involved.

08:06.870 --> 08:08.861
See, he was
the new state's attorney.

08:08.920 --> 08:10.000
Came in and started
mIcromanagIng

08:10.050 --> 08:11.358
right from the start.

08:11.400 --> 08:13.004
"Are you sure
about the witnesses?"

08:13.050 --> 08:14.836
"Was he properly Mirandized?"

08:14.880 --> 08:16.529
"What about the blood?"
"Are you sure?"

08:16.580 --> 08:18.536
And were you sure?

08:18.580 --> 08:20.354
This shouldn't
have been a mistrial.

08:20.410 --> 08:22.708
Richard Locke should be
in prison right now.

08:22.760 --> 08:24.057
It was premeditated.

08:24.110 --> 08:25.498
But you know
what he isdoing right now?

08:25.540 --> 08:27.713
He got married a month ago.

08:27.760 --> 08:29.546
Tough thing being rich.

08:29.590 --> 08:33.151
Yup, I'm sure he's
all broken up on the inside.

08:33.200 --> 08:36.078
Thanks.

08:36.120 --> 08:37.109
Go back to sleep.

08:39.210 --> 08:40.165
Hey,

08:40.210 --> 08:41.723
promise me one thing.

08:41.780 --> 08:42.906
What?

08:42.950 --> 08:45.862
Don't get the governor off.

08:45.910 --> 08:46.865
[knocking on door]

08:46.910 --> 08:48.127
ALICIA:
Grace, that's the florist.

08:48.170 --> 08:49.171
Can you get that?

08:49.220 --> 08:50.437
Mm-hmm.

09:00.190 --> 09:01.794
[chuckles]
We're here.

09:01.840 --> 09:05.230
JACKIE:
Grace, my dear.

09:05.280 --> 09:07.145
Grandma's here
ten minutes early!

09:07.190 --> 09:09.101
Well, traffic was so good.

09:09.150 --> 09:12.062
And you never can tell
if it's going to rain.

09:12.110 --> 09:14.237
Can I get a hit of that?

09:17.290 --> 09:20.817
How are you, Mom?

09:20.860 --> 09:23.420
[soft chuckle]
I'm hunky-dory.

09:23.470 --> 09:25.028
You seem frazzled.

09:25.080 --> 09:26.775
Thanks.
It's a good thing.

09:26.820 --> 09:28.037
It's more real.

09:28.080 --> 09:29.217
Okay.
To real.

09:36.140 --> 09:38.005
Just want to check my makeup.[gasps]

09:38.050 --> 09:39.483
Oh.

09:39.530 --> 09:42.044
Grandma, they made a
mistake. Don't worry.

09:42.100 --> 09:44.443
Oh, my God,
they are

09:44.490 --> 09:47.015
just beautiful.

09:47.060 --> 09:48.015
[gaSPS]

09:48.060 --> 09:49.049
You like them?

09:49.110 --> 09:50.919
Oh.

09:50.980 --> 09:53.232
Why are we hiding
them in the bedroom?

09:53.280 --> 09:54.679
[doorbell rings, door opens]

09:54.720 --> 09:59.111
Sorry we're early,
the traffic was light.

09:59.160 --> 10:02.414
Oh, you must be Zach.

10:02.470 --> 10:03.414
Mom?

10:03.470 --> 10:05.119
Grandma likes the flowers.

10:05.160 --> 10:07.902
She's pulling them
out into the living room.

10:07.950 --> 10:09.724
[doorbell rings]

10:09.780 --> 10:11.293
I thought we had
another ten minutes.

10:15.520 --> 10:16.919
Oh, hello.

10:16.960 --> 10:18.302
You're Grace, right?

10:18.350 --> 10:19.339
I'm Hannah McCreary.

10:19.400 --> 10:20.389
Is your brother... ?

10:29.620 --> 10:31.622
[laughs]

10:36.810 --> 10:38.539
ZACH:
Mom, I want you to meet

10:38.590 --> 10:40.717
my girlfriend, Hannah.

10:42.330 --> 10:44.594
I loved that you stood
by your husband.

10:44.640 --> 10:46.596
A lot of people my age
think it's a throwback

10:46.640 --> 10:48.289
to an old kind of domesticity,

10:48.340 --> 10:51.298
but I think it's a harbinger
of a new feminism.

10:51.340 --> 10:53.388
Like Huma Abedin, you know?

10:53.430 --> 10:54.909
Women should do what they want,

10:54.950 --> 10:57.692
even if what they want
is to stand by their man.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.867
Hi.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.171
Hannah's a proctor in my dorm.

11:01.220 --> 11:02.391
Really?

11:02.440 --> 11:03.600
I know I'm older,

11:03.660 --> 11:06.128
but Zach is older in maturity
than he looks.

11:06.180 --> 11:10.059
And sometimes compatibility
is more a function

11:10.100 --> 11:13.149
of intellectual reach than
physical years, don't you think?

11:15.190 --> 11:18.273
You look relaxed.

11:18.320 --> 11:20.459
CARY:
Upside of choosing
unemployment.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.411
[chuckles]
What do you need?

11:22.460 --> 11:25.099
Do you know Jason Crouse?

11:25.160 --> 11:26.320
I do.
My old work.

11:26.380 --> 11:27.324
He dropped by.

11:27.380 --> 11:28.506
That's why I called.

11:28.550 --> 11:30.199
He's investigating
for Peter Florrick,

11:30.250 --> 11:32.593
the Richard Locke mistrial.

11:32.640 --> 11:34.289
Makes sense.

11:34.340 --> 11:36.035
They're looking
for a scapegoat.

11:36.080 --> 11:37.035
That's what he said?

11:37.080 --> 11:38.479
No, that's what I know.

11:38.520 --> 11:40.476
They're looking for
someone to point a finger at.

11:40.520 --> 11:41.475
Well, it's not me.

11:41.520 --> 11:42.475
Are you sure?

11:42.520 --> 11:43.600
We were the prosecutors.

11:43.650 --> 11:45.254
We dealt with the evidence.

11:45.310 --> 11:47.346
We didn't tank it.

11:47.400 --> 11:48.742
Yeah, in my experience,

11:48.790 --> 11:51.304
whenever there's a battle
between truth and power,

11:51.360 --> 11:52.577
truth loses.

11:57.890 --> 11:59.755
So, how long have
they been dating?I don't know.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.791
I didn't even know that they
were dating; she's like 23.

12:01.850 --> 12:03.363
VERONICA: Alicia, what are you
doing in the kitchen?

12:03.410 --> 12:04.195
Get some catering help.

12:04.240 --> 12:05.411
Mom?
[chuckles]
Mwah.

12:05.460 --> 12:06.620
What are you doing here?

12:06.680 --> 12:07.806
Jackie invited me.

12:07.850 --> 12:09.579
And I drove her.
Mom can't drive anymore.

12:09.640 --> 12:11.369
No, I chose not to.

12:11.420 --> 12:12.762
Where's the wine?

12:12.810 --> 12:14.368
Wait, Jackie invited you?

12:14.420 --> 12:15.819
Why?
You guys hate each other.

12:15.860 --> 12:18.374
Oh, Alicia, sometimes you're
so innocent about women.

12:18.430 --> 12:19.727
Pour one for me, too.

12:19.780 --> 12:21.509
She invited me

12:21.560 --> 12:23.733
so she could lord it over me
about her new husband.

12:23.780 --> 12:26.123
I mean, this is how sick in
the head your mother-in-law is.

12:26.180 --> 12:27.829
She actually thought
I'd be jealous of Howard.

12:27.870 --> 12:28.825
[chuckles]

12:28.870 --> 12:30.826
Hey, darling.
Ooh.

12:30.880 --> 12:33.041
So, I heard you
got into college.
Yeah.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.783
Who's gonna be the
smart one now, huh?

12:34.840 --> 12:36.353
And, Alicia, empty nest--

12:36.400 --> 12:38.004
that is coming up quickly
for you, isn't it?

12:38.060 --> 12:40.665
Alicia, do you think
you have enough wine?

12:40.710 --> 12:42.268
Have you seen them out there?[Veronica chuckles]

12:42.320 --> 12:43.366
They're all senior citizens.

12:43.410 --> 12:44.445
We're gonna be
the only ones drinking.

12:44.500 --> 12:45.797
[laughs]No, Zach drinks, too, now.

12:45.850 --> 12:47.806
What? Zach?
How old is Zach?

12:47.850 --> 12:49.579
I thought he was
just out of high school.

12:49.630 --> 12:51.541
That's okay, children should
learn to drink young.

12:51.590 --> 12:53.854
Italian kids drink right out of
the crib, look at them.

12:53.900 --> 12:57.370
Sis, is there
anything I should know?

13:01.910 --> 13:06.472
Hey, thanks for
doing this for Mom.

13:06.520 --> 13:08.294
Can we talk for a minute?

13:08.350 --> 13:09.829
Sure.

13:09.870 --> 13:10.859
Eli, how are you?

13:10.920 --> 13:12.956
Marissa, you look beautiful.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.740
Thank you.
I'm Dad's plus-one.

13:14.790 --> 13:15.950
Thought I'd class him up.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.924
There was a misunderstanding.

13:21.970 --> 13:23.961
Ah.

13:24.020 --> 13:25.317
So I talked to Chris Broccoli,

13:25.360 --> 13:27.885
and he had a suggestion.

13:27.930 --> 13:28.885
Neil?

13:28.930 --> 13:30.978
Yeah, the divorce lawyer.

13:31.020 --> 13:33.716
He suggested we do
a one-lavwer divorce

13:33.760 --> 13:35.546
since it's amicable.

13:35.590 --> 13:38.593
We don't have to use him if you
want to agree on someone else.

13:38.640 --> 13:40.460
One-one—one minute.
Thank you.

13:40.510 --> 13:42.899
What do you think?

13:42.950 --> 13:46.113
I think that's... smart.

13:46.170 --> 13:47.421
Good.

13:47.470 --> 13:48.778
Because I don't want
to fight with you.

13:48.820 --> 13:49.775
I know.

13:49.820 --> 13:51.822
I don't want to either.

13:53.130 --> 13:55.086
So Zach brought
a girlfriend here.

13:55.130 --> 13:57.303
Hannah.

13:57.350 --> 13:58.783
Really?

13:58.830 --> 14:02.869
She's 23 years old,
she graduates this year.

14:02.920 --> 14:04.569
Should we be worried?

14:04.620 --> 14:07.088
Oh, I don't know.

14:07.150 --> 14:10.017
It's a college romance,
they don't last long.

14:10.060 --> 14:11.368
We were a college romance.

14:11.410 --> 14:12.308
And look at us.

14:12.370 --> 14:13.496
[laughs]

14:13.540 --> 14:15.098
One second.Could you give us a moment?

14:15.150 --> 14:16.879
[door shuts]

14:16.940 --> 14:18.635
So...

14:18.680 --> 14:20.454
we're divorcing, then?

14:20.510 --> 14:22.466
We are.

14:22.510 --> 14:25.070
Do you feel sad?

14:25.120 --> 14:26.849
I do.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.379
I guess it's just...

14:32.390 --> 14:33.903
...that's what happens.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.121
Yeah.

14:36.170 --> 14:37.432
[knocking on door]

14:37.480 --> 14:40.608
GRACE: Mom, I think
you'd better get out here!

14:43.140 --> 14:44.562
What?
L'chaim!

14:44.620 --> 14:46.918
To another marriage
in the family.

14:46.970 --> 14:48.835
Congrats to Zach and Hannah.

14:48.880 --> 14:51.576
[cheering and clapping,
glasses clinking]

15:09.470 --> 15:11.904
Alicia,
why is he getting married?

15:11.950 --> 15:14.771
I don't know, Mom,
why don't you ask him?

15:14.820 --> 15:16.128
He'd just say "love."

15:16.170 --> 15:17.774
You were like that
when you were In college.

15:17.820 --> 15:19.515
Have you talked to her,
the girlfriend?

15:19.570 --> 15:20.912
Not much.

15:20.960 --> 15:22.951
Grace says she's 23.
He's 19.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.265
Yes, and Dad was eight years
older than you.No, he wasn't.

15:26.310 --> 15:28.653
Besides, it was a totally
different thing-- he was a man.

15:28.710 --> 15:29.699
Oh, my God.

15:29.750 --> 15:30.705
OWEN:
Where are you going?

15:30.750 --> 15:32.001
To talk to my son.

15:32.060 --> 15:34.278
Hi, Kurt, Diane,
thank you for coming.

15:34.320 --> 15:36.049
Hi, it's so nice
of you to do this.

15:36.100 --> 15:38.534
Well, Howard is family now.

15:38.580 --> 15:39.888
[laughs]
He is.

15:39.930 --> 15:40.885
Can we talk later?

15:40.940 --> 15:41.929
Sure.

15:46.420 --> 15:47.808
Ow!

15:47.850 --> 15:49.670
DIANE:
You're in an odd mood.

15:49.730 --> 15:50.981
[indistinct chatter]

15:51.030 --> 15:52.759
He's dropping out of school.

15:52.820 --> 15:53.946
Not forever, all right?

15:53.990 --> 15:55.981
I'll probably go back
in a year or two.

15:56.040 --> 15:58.941
You know it cost us $60,000
to put you in that school?

15:59.000 --> 16:00.342
And you'll save
that money next year.

16:00.390 --> 16:02.995
Why? Why are you
dropping out, Zach?

16:03.040 --> 16:04.041
Hannah got a job in France.

16:04.090 --> 16:05.569
A good job as a translator.

16:05.610 --> 16:07.658
He's moving to France.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.349
And what are you
going to do in France?

16:09.400 --> 16:11.095
I don't know, I've been
thinking about writing.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.129
Zach.

16:17.060 --> 16:17.958
Zach, come on.
Look at your mom.

16:18.020 --> 16:18.964
It's insane.

16:19.020 --> 16:21.011
I mean,
who's gonna pay for this?

16:21.060 --> 16:22.448
Hannah, she has a good job.

16:22.500 --> 16:23.797
You're gonna let her
pay for you?

16:23.850 --> 16:25.932
Why not? We're not as held up
on the gender thing.

16:25.980 --> 16:26.969
[scoffs]

16:31.290 --> 16:32.245
Alicia?

16:32.290 --> 16:34.201
Yeah?

16:34.250 --> 16:37.026
Do you want to join us?

16:37.080 --> 16:38.035
Sorry.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.036
Um...
[clears throat]

16:40.080 --> 16:42.128
Zach, face it.

16:42.170 --> 16:44.161
This is the stupidest thing
I've heard you say in a while.

16:44.220 --> 16:47.121
Thanks, Mom.And there have been some
pretty stupid things.

16:47.180 --> 16:48.386
PETER:
All right, let's not go...

16:48.440 --> 16:49.953
You're gonna move to
France with Hannah

16:50.000 --> 16:52.651
so you can be a househusband
and write what?

16:52.700 --> 16:54.224
What are yougonna write, Zach?

16:54.270 --> 16:55.225
A memoir.

16:55.270 --> 16:57.181
I'm in a memoir class.

16:57.230 --> 16:58.743
[laughs]

16:58.800 --> 17:00.404
Okay, you know what?

17:00.450 --> 17:02.054
I love her, all right?

17:02.100 --> 17:03.533
And I'm getting married
and we're moving to France.

17:03.580 --> 17:05.013
All right, wait a minute.

17:05.060 --> 17:06.049
Zach, we're your parents
and we love you,

17:06.110 --> 17:07.759
but we want you
to think about this.

17:07.800 --> 17:11.361
Well, we have one kid left.

17:11.420 --> 17:12.842
I guess we shouldn't
laugh at him.

17:12.900 --> 17:13.844
I know.

17:13.900 --> 17:16.539
I'm sorry.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.670
I think you have to handle
this; I've been drinking.

17:20.250 --> 17:22.980
You're a good dad, you know?

17:23.040 --> 17:24.120
Are you being funny?

17:24.170 --> 17:26.559
No, you are.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.085
Okay.

17:29.130 --> 17:31.826
I'll talk to Zach.

17:31.870 --> 17:34.600
Oh, and say what?

17:34.660 --> 17:37.083
"Je ne sais pas"?

17:37.140 --> 17:38.129
[both laugh]

17:38.180 --> 17:39.659
[phone rings]

17:43.230 --> 17:45.960
Go ahead, take it.

17:46.020 --> 17:47.829
[ringing stops]

17:47.890 --> 17:49.312
No.

17:49.370 --> 17:50.667
That's okay.

17:50.720 --> 17:52.062
ALICIA: I'm away from my phone
at the moment,

17:52.110 --> 17:53.190
so please leave a message.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.151
[beep]Hey, Alicia, it's me, I...

17:55.200 --> 17:56.542
I've called you a couple times.

17:56.590 --> 17:57.898
I know you're partying it up,

17:57.940 --> 18:00.807
but could you call me, please?

18:00.860 --> 18:03.681
Um...
So...

18:03.730 --> 18:04.719
Jason Crouse.

18:04.770 --> 18:07.466
Detective Rick Crowell.

18:07.520 --> 18:08.680
How's it going?

18:08.730 --> 18:10.163
Overworked and underpaid.

18:10.210 --> 18:12.258
I know the feeling.

18:12.300 --> 18:13.255
So you were the first responder

18:13.300 --> 18:14.119
at the_Richard Locke
crIme scene.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.124
I was.

18:15.180 --> 18:16.659
Bad case.

18:16.700 --> 18:19.954
Did you think that Peter
Florrick micromanaged it?

18:20.010 --> 18:21.307
No.

18:21.360 --> 18:23.089
Best state's attorney
we've had in 20 years

18:23.140 --> 18:24.220
and a hell of a governor.

18:24.270 --> 18:27.137
And that has nothing
to do with the fact

18:27.190 --> 18:29.226
that you work private
security for his campaign?

18:31.150 --> 18:33.186
No.

18:33.240 --> 18:34.889
Best state's attorney
we've had in 20 years

18:34.930 --> 18:37.069
and a hell of a governor.

18:39.550 --> 18:40.585
Okay.

18:43.940 --> 18:46.158
And, yes, it was odd
he came to the crime scene,

18:46.210 --> 18:47.427
but I read nothing into that.

18:50.210 --> 18:51.598
It's probably just irrelevant

18:51.650 --> 18:54.289
that he wanted to double-check
all the blood collection.

18:57.740 --> 19:00.959
Thanks, Rick.

19:04.700 --> 19:06.099
I need a lawyer.

19:06.140 --> 19:08.267
You had a whole suite of them.
Why me?

19:08.320 --> 19:10.265
I don't work there anymore.

19:10.320 --> 19:12.049
I'm sorry about that.

19:12.100 --> 19:13.795
[chuckling]:
I'm not.

19:13.840 --> 19:16.013
And now you want to sue.

19:16.060 --> 19:18.278
No, this is about the governor.

19:23.240 --> 19:24.457
Let's talk.

19:24.510 --> 19:27.377
I'm so glad that you
find my life funny, Mom.

19:27.420 --> 19:29.331
I'm not laughing now, Zach.

19:29.380 --> 19:31.723
I'm asking a favor.

19:31.770 --> 19:33.943
I'm in love, Mom.

19:33.990 --> 19:36.129
You should be talking to
Hannah right now, not me.

19:36.170 --> 19:38.866
Try to figure out why
I'm in love with her.

19:38.910 --> 19:40.958
I see you and Dad rolling
your eyes about her,

19:41.000 --> 19:42.251
she's not up to your
standards, she...

19:42.310 --> 19:46.349
Zach,
let's make this simple, okay?

19:46.400 --> 19:47.822
Your dad is on trial.

19:47.880 --> 19:49.700
Mom, don't guilt me with that.

19:49.750 --> 19:52.184
Zach, he's in trouble.

19:52.230 --> 19:53.663
He could go to prison
for three years.

19:56.450 --> 19:58.179
Just...

19:58.240 --> 20:00.663
don't move to France
untll It's over.

20:00.720 --> 20:03.621
That's all I ask, okay?

20:03.680 --> 20:05.159
It's what you do for family.

20:15.300 --> 20:17.985
This lab took a lot of flack
over the Richard Locke case.

20:18.040 --> 20:19.257
Cost me a promotion.

20:19.300 --> 20:21.120
I understand, ma'am.

20:21.170 --> 20:22.728
The blood spatter found
at the crime scene,

20:22.780 --> 20:24.304
it was...
Processed correctly.

20:24.350 --> 20:27.433
As was all the evidence,
by me personally.

20:27.480 --> 20:29.300
Then I don't
understand the problem.

20:29.350 --> 20:30.692
There is no problem.

20:30.750 --> 20:32.786
He just told me
not to use it, that's all.

20:32.840 --> 20:34.171
Florrick?

20:34.230 --> 20:35.925
Yes, Florrick, the governor.

20:35.970 --> 20:37.403
Look, you want to spin this

20:37.450 --> 20:40.442
_ to make it look
like we screwed up,

20:40.500 --> 20:41.967
but he's the one who insisted

20:42.020 --> 20:43.920
that the blood evidence
was mishandled.

20:43.980 --> 20:46.938
That would've put
Locke away for 30 years,

20:46.980 --> 20:48.368
but Florrick vetoed it.

20:48.420 --> 20:49.455
Why?

20:49.500 --> 20:52.378
I don't know.
Ask him.

20:54.600 --> 20:56.943
But first...

20:56.990 --> 20:58.423
I'd check the evidence log.

20:58.470 --> 21:00.199
Something's missing.

21:02.130 --> 21:04.598
_LUCCA:
Nice party.

21:04.650 --> 21:07.608
[chuckles]

21:07.650 --> 21:09.379
So. ..
[clears throat]

21:09.440 --> 21:11.305
Jason called.

21:11.350 --> 21:12.908
He said you weren't
returning his calls.

21:12.960 --> 21:15.087
I'm throwing a party.

21:15.140 --> 21:18.485
He thought it was
more than that.

21:20.970 --> 21:22.835
[clears throat]

21:22.890 --> 21:24.619
I told him
I wanted to be with him.

21:24.670 --> 21:27.059
All the time.

21:27.110 --> 21:28.407
Okay.

21:28.460 --> 21:29.404
What did he say?

21:29.460 --> 21:31.280
He gave me a deed to Mars.

21:31.330 --> 21:33.491
I don't understand,
is that a metaphor?

21:33.550 --> 21:39.329
He gave me a gift
of a deed he bought online.

21:39.380 --> 21:43.680
A deed to 500 acres... on Mars.

21:43.730 --> 21:45.379
I don't know
what I'm doing anymore

21:45.430 --> 21:47.330
or why I thought
that I loved him.

21:47.390 --> 21:48.345
It was a joke.

21:48.390 --> 21:49.641
I'm sure it was a joke.

21:49.690 --> 21:51.339
I-I don't know who he is.

21:51.390 --> 21:54.302
Uh, I-I don't know
anything about him.

21:54.350 --> 21:55.863
Then find out about him.

21:55.920 --> 21:57.342
I think you're in his head.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.698
He didn't sound like himself.

21:59.750 --> 22:03.789
At least return his calls.

22:03.840 --> 22:04.829
[gunshot]

22:13.810 --> 22:14.754
VERONICA:
Yeah, your mother

22:14.810 --> 22:17.199
wanted to drop out of college.

22:17.240 --> 22:20.539
She wanted to go
to India for a year.

22:20.600 --> 22:21.589
Seriously?

22:21.640 --> 22:23.631
Ah, well, it was
a different time.

22:23.690 --> 22:24.759
No, she didn't.

22:24.820 --> 22:26.378
Mom, you're making that up.

22:26.430 --> 22:28.159
I'm not making it up.

22:28.210 --> 22:29.461
You're not privy
to every conversation

22:29.520 --> 22:30.862
between mother and daughter,
you know.

22:30.910 --> 22:32.389
JACl_<IE:
Hi.

22:32.430 --> 22:34.569
Oh, there you are, Veronica.

22:34.610 --> 22:36.384
How are you?

22:36.440 --> 22:37.384
I'm good.

22:37.440 --> 22:38.862
Drinking, I see.

22:38.920 --> 22:41.218
Yes.

22:41.270 --> 22:44.262
It's the one way I have of
dealing with that jealousy

22:44.310 --> 22:46.050
over you having a husband,
while I have none.

22:47.490 --> 22:51.449
Some people deal with loneliness
in different ways.

22:51.500 --> 22:53.013
Yes, that's me.

22:53.060 --> 22:54.459
Lonely.

22:54.500 --> 22:58.106
And worrying about Peter
and Alicia getting a divorce.

22:58.150 --> 23:00.232
What?Oh, I'm sorry, you didn't know?

23:00.290 --> 23:03.373
Yes, your son and my daughter
are getting a divorce.

23:03.420 --> 23:05.763
[scoffs]
They are not.

23:05.810 --> 23:07.414
Oh, yes, they are.

23:07.470 --> 23:09.552
David Lee told me, he's very
upset that they didn't hire him.

23:09.600 --> 23:11.465
Mom, maybe now's
not the right time.

23:11.520 --> 23:12.464
Wha...

23:12.520 --> 23:14.385
Oh, uh...

23:14.430 --> 23:16.159
Grace, no, I-I could be wrong.

23:16.220 --> 23:17.824
You never know.

23:20.480 --> 23:22.869
What does David Lee say about
this? He can't agree to it.

23:22.920 --> 23:24.478
He makes the same money.

23:24.530 --> 23:25.565
And it's branding.

23:25.620 --> 23:27.656
He understands branding.

23:27.710 --> 23:29.439
An all-female partnership?

23:29.490 --> 23:31.401
Yes, congratulations.

23:31.450 --> 23:32.405
Congratulations.

23:35.540 --> 23:36.575
You're getting a divorce?

23:36.630 --> 23:37.927
Grandma says
you're getting a divorce.

23:37.980 --> 23:40.540
She heard it from David Lee.

23:40.590 --> 23:41.545
Would you excuse me, Diane?

23:49.470 --> 23:50.721
Can we just talk here?

23:50.770 --> 23:52.021
Why is everything always
secrets in this family?

23:52.080 --> 23:53.638
Zach, please.

23:58.390 --> 24:00.164
Eli.

24:00.220 --> 24:02.472
Where's Peter?
I don't know.

24:02.520 --> 24:04.829
I'm thinking of going to
law school, what do you think?

24:04.870 --> 24:07.475
Great.
Can-can we talk later?

24:07.530 --> 24:09.998
It says
"well-regulated militia."

24:10.050 --> 24:12.132
Actually, I'm gonna get a drink.

24:15.540 --> 24:19.499
Oh, actually, I'd like
to talk to Zach and Grace alone.

24:19.540 --> 24:21.667
No, anything you say to me,
you can say to her.

24:21.720 --> 24:24.280
No, thank you, though.

24:24.330 --> 24:26.719
[door opens and shuts]

24:26.760 --> 24:27.897
How long ago did you decide?

24:27.940 --> 24:28.895
A month ago.

24:28.940 --> 24:30.589
And you're just now telling us?

24:30.640 --> 24:33.029
We weren't telling anyone.We're not "anyone," Mom.

24:33.080 --> 24:35.423
You're right.
I'm sorry.

24:35.470 --> 24:37.335
We just wanted to get
through Dad's trial.

24:37.380 --> 24:39.336
Is this about Jason?

24:39.390 --> 24:40.903
Wait, who's Jason?

24:40.950 --> 24:43.089
Her investigator.

24:43.130 --> 24:44.643
You have an investigator?Well, her firm does.

24:44.700 --> 24:46.349
So, this is about him?

24:46.390 --> 24:47.345
It isn't.

24:47.390 --> 24:49.267
But?
But what?

24:49.310 --> 24:50.698
It just sounded like you're
going to say something else.

24:50.750 --> 24:53.264
No, just...You're sleeping with him.

24:53.310 --> 24:54.481
That is none of your business.

24:54.530 --> 24:56.350
Just like Hannah's
none of your busmess.

24:56.400 --> 24:58.311
That's different.How is it different?

24:58.360 --> 24:59.839
We think you're making
a mistake.

24:59.880 --> 25:02.144
You mean as opposed to you
sleeping with your investigator?

25:02.190 --> 25:03.361
Okay, this has
nothing to do with you.

25:03.410 --> 25:04.536
I'm the parent here.

25:04.590 --> 25:05.921
Okay, you know what
the difference is?

25:05.980 --> 25:07.368
I'm getting married and
you're getting divorced,

25:07.410 --> 25:09.059
and I'm the one
who's making the mistake?

25:15.600 --> 25:16.544
Mom?

25:16.600 --> 25:17.760
Hi.

25:24.740 --> 25:26.219
Actually, I didn't know that
you would be out here.

25:26.260 --> 25:29.514
I'm here for Eli,
he asked me not to call.

25:29.570 --> 25:31.344
Oh, uh, I'll go get him.Wait.

25:31.390 --> 25:32.732
I want to talk to you, too.

25:32.790 --> 25:35.042
I-I called you earlier.

25:35.090 --> 25:37.615
Yes, we'll talk.

25:37.660 --> 25:38.968
I'll...

25:39.010 --> 25:39.999
I'll get Eli.

25:44.230 --> 25:45.447
[sighs]

25:45.500 --> 25:49.106
First the groom
signs the ketubah.

25:49.150 --> 25:50.367
Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

25:50.410 --> 25:52.014
[all laugh]

25:52.070 --> 25:53.412
And the bride.

25:56.200 --> 25:57.508
And the two witnesses.

25:57.550 --> 26:00.417
Mr. Gold.

26:00.470 --> 26:02.244
And Ms. Gold.

26:02.290 --> 26:03.245
JACKIE:
My two Jewish friends.

26:03.300 --> 26:04.779
[all laugh]

26:04.820 --> 26:08.039
How nice.HOWARD: Thank you, thank you.

26:08.080 --> 26:09.297
Bravo.JACKIE: Ah.

26:15.790 --> 26:17.087
That was fast.

26:17.140 --> 26:19.005
It wasn't hard;
nobody's hiding anything.

26:19.050 --> 26:20.608
That doesn't sound good.

26:20.660 --> 26:22.480
Peter micromanaged the case.

26:22.530 --> 26:23.872
He went to the crime scene.

26:23.930 --> 26:25.875
He did?
Why?

26:25.930 --> 26:27.227
Nobody knew.

26:27.280 --> 26:28.440
He questioned all the evidence,

26:28.490 --> 26:29.969
he even vetoed some.

26:30.020 --> 26:31.180
Maybe it was bad evidence.

26:31.240 --> 26:32.753
It was blood spatter
from the apartment.

26:32.800 --> 26:35.360
It showed that
Locke's story was a lie.

26:35.410 --> 26:37.890
Peter told the lab tech
not to use it.

26:37.940 --> 26:39.282
There's more.

26:39.330 --> 26:41.764
The bullets that killed
Locke's girlfriend?

26:41.810 --> 26:44.074
They went missing
from the crime lab.

26:44.120 --> 26:45.769
Peter was _ _
the last person to Sign in.

26:45.820 --> 26:48.072
Okay, let me talk to him.

26:48.120 --> 26:49.849
Stay on it.

26:52.300 --> 26:53.210
Eli?

26:53.260 --> 26:54.864
Could you...

26:54.910 --> 26:56.514
could you get Alicia for me?

26:56.570 --> 26:57.787
I need to tell her something.

26:57.830 --> 26:59.525
She's hosting.

26:59.570 --> 27:01.879
I know,
it'll just take a second.

27:01.920 --> 27:03.649
This thing says
I'm supposed to give the bride

27:03.700 --> 27:04.962
a couple of pieces of silver,Ah.

27:05.010 --> 27:06.090
just don't count on it.Oh.

27:06.140 --> 27:10.144
[guests laugh, phone rings]

27:10.190 --> 27:11.885
Hello.

27:11.930 --> 27:13.704
Mr. Canning, what do you want?

27:13.760 --> 27:15.364
To play on the same team.

27:15.410 --> 27:17.935
You know how we always do better
when we fight the same fights.

27:17.980 --> 27:19.800
And what fight
are we talking about?

27:19.850 --> 27:21.067
Well, I'm representing

27:21.110 --> 27:23.021
Cary Agos in
the Peter Florrick case,

27:23.070 --> 27:24.150
and I understand you represent

27:24.200 --> 27:26.065
Eli Gold.

27:28.770 --> 27:32.240
And, um,
you want to join forces?

27:32.300 --> 27:35.292
The more Peter's old allies
appear in lockstep against him,

27:35.340 --> 27:37.558
the more it keeps
a spotlight on him.

27:37.610 --> 27:40.955
It deflects culpability
from our guys.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.264
I call it
"the coalition of the innocent."

27:43.310 --> 27:47.041
This isn't a good idea.

27:47.100 --> 27:48.226
Okay.

27:48.270 --> 27:49.658
Then let's go.

27:49.710 --> 27:50.654
I can't.

27:50.710 --> 27:53.224
I just want to talk.

27:53.280 --> 27:54.668
Tomorrow.
No.

27:54.710 --> 27:55.836
Tonight.

27:55.890 --> 27:58.791
Oh.

27:58.850 --> 28:00.977
Thank you.
Yeah.

28:03.500 --> 28:05.809
I didn't handle
that well earlier,

28:05.850 --> 28:09.638
and then I came back
here and it was awkward,

28:09.680 --> 28:12.331
and I know that if you have
two awkward moments in a row,

28:12.380 --> 28:15.247
that it can be
trouble clawing it back.

28:15.300 --> 28:18.428
What are we clawing back?

28:18.470 --> 28:19.869
That thing that I gave you...

28:19.910 --> 28:20.865
The Mars property?

28:20.910 --> 28:24.732
Yeah.

28:24.790 --> 28:26.735
See, I didn't know
that I was coming here

28:26.790 --> 28:28.746
and we were gonna have
a serious conversation.

28:28.790 --> 28:30.348
It was...

28:30.400 --> 28:33.654
it was in my pocket, and it was
just supposed to be this...

28:33.710 --> 28:36.133
this fun thing.

28:36.190 --> 28:38.829
I like space,
I like stuff about space.

28:38.890 --> 28:41.927
I get it.

28:41.980 --> 28:42.924
I'm fine.

28:42.980 --> 28:43.924
I'd better get back.

28:43.980 --> 28:46.323
No, please wait.

28:47.330 --> 28:49.764
Uh...

28:49.810 --> 28:53.155
I don't like spending more
than a year in any one place,

28:53.200 --> 28:55.725
I like to be able to drop
everything at a moment's notice

28:55.770 --> 28:56.759
and just go.

28:56.820 --> 28:58.594
Then go, no one's stopping you.

28:58.640 --> 28:59.686
You are.

28:59.730 --> 29:00.776
No, I'm not.

29:00.820 --> 29:04.085
Yes, you are.

29:04.130 --> 29:06.860
[car horns honking]

29:06.910 --> 29:09.083
Okay.

29:09.130 --> 29:11.655
I think we need to clarify
what we're saying here.

29:11.700 --> 29:15.045
I want you, too.

29:19.010 --> 29:19.965
You do?

29:20.010 --> 29:22.797
I do,

29:22.840 --> 29:26.583
but I am trying to explain
to you that I can't be...

29:26.630 --> 29:28.450
stuck.

29:28.500 --> 29:31.674
And I would make you feel stuck?

29:31.720 --> 29:33.199
No.

29:33.240 --> 29:35.629
No, you just have
this whole life here.

29:35.680 --> 29:39.207
You have beautiful kids,
a beautiful place,

29:39.250 --> 29:40.296
and a business.

29:40.340 --> 29:42.900
And you want me to give that up?No.

29:42.950 --> 29:44.724
No, I am just...
I'm bringing up a problem.

29:44.780 --> 29:46.907
I'm not saying
that there's a solution.

29:46.950 --> 29:48.212
Okay.

29:48.260 --> 29:52.082
I'm gonna repeat to you
what I thinkI heard.

29:52.130 --> 29:56.692
You want to go somewhere else
and you want me to go with you,

29:56.750 --> 29:58.308
but not now,
but at some point

29:58.360 --> 30:00.828
when you get itchy
about staying in one place?

30:03.270 --> 30:07.092
[chuckles]

30:07.150 --> 30:09.368
Oth”

30:09.410 --> 30:10.718
I need to think on this.

30:33.260 --> 30:35.728
[indistinct conversations]

30:35.790 --> 30:37.781
So, do you know anyone here?

30:37.830 --> 30:38.785
A few.

30:38.830 --> 30:40.957
So why law school?

30:41.010 --> 30:42.432
I thought you'd be happy.

30:42.490 --> 30:43.445
I don't know.

30:43.490 --> 30:44.787
Feels like a trick.

30:44.840 --> 30:45.829
The law is exciting.

30:45.880 --> 30:46.835
Things move fast.

30:46.880 --> 30:49.189
Uh, no, they don't.

30:49.230 --> 30:50.834
Most of the law
is just boring...

30:50.890 --> 30:52.573
paperwork and meetings.[phone rings]

30:52.630 --> 30:54.188
Hello?

30:54.240 --> 30:55.662
How rude.

30:55.720 --> 30:57.415
Answering your cell
at a dinner party?

30:57.460 --> 31:00.020
Oh, hi. Um, yeah, I'm standing
right next to him. Why?

31:00.070 --> 31:01.116
Who is it?

31:01.160 --> 31:02.889
Mike Tascioni.

31:02.940 --> 31:03.850
Tom is sick.

31:03.900 --> 31:05.549
Why's he calling you?

31:05.600 --> 31:07.295
And why's he calling you
about his dog?

31:07.340 --> 31:08.329
We've grown close.

31:08.380 --> 31:09.722
He couldn't get a hold of you.

31:09.780 --> 31:11.554
What number is he trying?
Shh!

31:11.600 --> 31:14.342
Oh, no, that-that's
terrible.

31:14.390 --> 31:16.426
Uh... okay, hold on.

31:16.480 --> 31:19.517
Tom had a nervous reaction
to medication.

31:19.570 --> 31:21.219
And he can't argue in court.

31:21.270 --> 31:22.919
What?

31:22.960 --> 31:24.564
Mike, what?

31:24.620 --> 31:26.918
You can't just...

31:26.970 --> 31:28.961
You're leaving us in the lurch?

31:29.010 --> 31:30.659
I don't care
how sick your dog...

31:30.710 --> 31:32.792
He hung up on me.

31:32.840 --> 31:34.489
Eli, can I borrow you?

31:34.540 --> 31:36.974
I-I'm kind of in the middle of
an emergency right now, Diane.

31:37.020 --> 31:39.068
Listen, can Cary Agos hurt you

31:39.110 --> 31:41.931
with this
Richard Locke business?

31:41.980 --> 31:43.288
I just lost
Peter's trial lawyer.

31:43.330 --> 31:44.581
I need your help.

31:44.640 --> 31:45.982
See?
Things do move fast.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.815
Why did you veto
the blood spatter?

31:54.860 --> 31:56.168
What?

31:56.210 --> 31:57.859
The blood spatter at the
Richard Locke crime scene.

31:57.910 --> 32:00.902
It pointed to his guilt and you
told the lab tech not to use it.

32:00.960 --> 32:04.339
Did you hire a new investigator?

32:04.400 --> 32:06.265
Or is this from Jason Crouse?

32:06.310 --> 32:07.652
Answer the question, Peter.

32:07.700 --> 32:09.964
Why did you veto
the blood spatter?

32:10.010 --> 32:11.352
The blood spatter
was compromised

32:11.400 --> 32:13.960
by the lab tech
who collected it.

32:14.010 --> 32:15.705
I was there, I saw it.

32:15.750 --> 32:20.847
So, all of a sudden you decide
to show up at a crime scene?

32:20.890 --> 32:22.494
What the hell were you thinking?

32:22.540 --> 32:27.284
Listen, Eli, this case was going
to be scrutinized.

32:27.330 --> 32:28.979
It was going to be our O.J.,

32:29.030 --> 32:30.895
so I went down there
to get ahead of it.

32:30.940 --> 32:33.898
Except this lab tech walked
right through the blood.

32:33.950 --> 32:36.726
So I vetoed it.

32:36.780 --> 32:38.725
Because allowing it
would've lost us the trial.

32:38.780 --> 32:39.940
And the bullets?

32:40.000 --> 32:41.900
You were the last person
to sign for them.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.690
Yeah, like I said, this blood
spatter was a royal screwup.

32:44.740 --> 32:46.219
So I went down to
look into this lab tech,

32:46.260 --> 32:47.818
and lo and behold,

32:47.870 --> 32:50.259
she had a whole string
of similar screwups

32:50.310 --> 32:51.868
going back two years.

32:51.920 --> 32:54.525
So I hired someone else
to check the ballistics.

32:54.580 --> 32:56.480
VVho?
Kurt McVeigh.

33:02.060 --> 33:04.528
God, I like watching you.

33:04.590 --> 33:06.148
Eat.

33:06.200 --> 33:08.976
Shoot

33:09.030 --> 33:10.895
Just stand.

33:10.940 --> 33:12.191
Good thing I like
being watched.

33:12.250 --> 33:14.980
[chuckles]

33:15.030 --> 33:16.076
Let's go home.

33:16.120 --> 33:19.032
[inhales sharply]
Ten more minutes.

33:19.080 --> 33:20.206
I don't want to be rude.

33:28.180 --> 33:30.603
Uh, Jason,
I need to talk to you.

33:30.660 --> 33:31.649
It's important.

33:34.440 --> 33:37.523
GIFFORD:
I did what I had to do.

33:37.580 --> 33:41.220
[panting]: I killed people
that needed killing.

33:43.410 --> 33:45.878
I know.

33:45.930 --> 33:47.056
I know, not...

33:47.110 --> 33:49.192
not you.

33:53.590 --> 33:55.899
I'm sorry.

33:55.940 --> 33:58.158
I told him to call ahead.

33:58.210 --> 34:00.075
Excuse me?

34:00.120 --> 34:02.076
I told Zach
he should call ahead,

34:02.120 --> 34:06.033
but he wanted
to surprise you.

34:06.080 --> 34:08.071
You hate me, don't you?

34:08.130 --> 34:10.121
No.

34:11.170 --> 34:12.956
We are in love.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.956
I know.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.309
We're just worried that
things are moving too fast.

34:17.350 --> 34:18.999
How long have you known
each other?

34:19.050 --> 34:20.358
A year.

34:20.400 --> 34:22.095
Do you really think that's...

34:22.140 --> 34:25.223
long enough to make the biggest
commitment of your life?

34:25.280 --> 34:28.090
How long did you know each other
before you got married?

34:28.150 --> 34:29.447
Three years.

34:29.500 --> 34:30.535
And now you're divorcing.

34:30.590 --> 34:35.152
[soft chuckle]
Yes.

34:35.200 --> 34:37.236
That's why I'm concerned.

34:37.290 --> 34:41.898
I don't want Zach, or you,

34:41.940 --> 34:43.680
to go through what I am.

34:43.730 --> 34:46.119
But that's the thing,

34:46.170 --> 34:47.159
we won't.

34:47.210 --> 34:49.030
Well, you don't know that.

34:49.080 --> 34:54.734
No, I mean we won't go
through all the... mess.

34:54.780 --> 34:57.169
It's just marriage.

34:57.220 --> 34:59.734
My parents divorced,

34:59.790 --> 35:02.179
but they still see
each other,

35:02.230 --> 35:05.358
they still love each other.

35:05.400 --> 35:09.700
But they see
other people, too.

35:09.750 --> 35:11.627
Marriage should work for us,

35:11.670 --> 35:15.197
not us for marriage.

35:15.240 --> 35:18.619
If Zach doesn't like France,
he can leave me.

35:18.680 --> 35:20.716
Come back home, go to school.

35:24.070 --> 35:28.154
If he meets someone else
he loves more, then...

35:28.210 --> 35:29.723
why should I trap him?

35:29.770 --> 35:32.944
Marriage should be fun,
it shouldn't be this...

35:33.000 --> 35:35.161
weight,

35:35.220 --> 35:37.688
this death knell.

35:37.740 --> 35:41.176
Well...

35:41.220 --> 35:44.690
if it isn't permanent,
then why get married at all?

35:44.750 --> 35:47.139
Taxes.

35:47.180 --> 35:49.398
GIFFORD:
Forgive me, Father,

35:49.450 --> 35:51.486
for I have sinned.

35:51.540 --> 35:54.759
I have hurt so many people.

35:59.500 --> 36:02.367
Peter can explain
everything.

36:02.420 --> 36:03.842
I'm sure he can.

36:03.900 --> 36:05.197
He vetoed the blood splatter

36:05.250 --> 36:07.593
because the lab tech botched
the evidence collection.

36:07.640 --> 36:10.154
Turns out she has a history
of sloppy mistakes.

36:10.210 --> 36:11.598
Why'd he sign in at the lab?

36:11.640 --> 36:13.119
He was checking up on the tech.

36:13.170 --> 36:14.421
And the missing bullets?

36:17.470 --> 36:19.290
I'm sorry,
but I have to ask, Jason,

36:19.350 --> 36:24.174
are your feelings for Alicia
getting in the way of this?

36:24.220 --> 36:26.871
If you think so,
feel free to fire me.

36:26.920 --> 36:30.617
You know, you're right.

36:30.660 --> 36:33.003
Thank you.

36:33.060 --> 36:34.869
You can send me your bill.

36:49.590 --> 36:52.548
You must have one
hell of a union.

36:52.600 --> 36:53.897
Excuse me?

36:53.950 --> 36:57.465
Botched hair evidence
in a 2011 rape trial,

36:57.510 --> 37:02.072
misidentified bite marks
in a 2010 aggravated assault,

37:02.130 --> 37:04.564
and yet you still
have a job.

37:04.610 --> 37:05.952
What do you want, Mr. Crouse?

37:06.000 --> 37:07.251
I didn't do my
homework before,

37:07.310 --> 37:09.778
but you have quite a
history of sloppy mistakes

37:09.830 --> 37:11.786
costing Peter Florrick
convictions.

37:11.830 --> 37:15.573
And you didn't tell me that
you walked through the blood

37:15.620 --> 37:17.747
at the_Richard Locke
crime scene.

37:17.800 --> 37:20.485
There were at least
a dozen cops in that apartment.

37:20.540 --> 37:23.316
There was no room
to maneuver,

37:23.370 --> 37:24.189
but I didn't lose
those bullets.

37:24.240 --> 37:25.138
Did the AUSA interview you?

37:25.190 --> 37:26.794
I'm not talking anymore.

37:26.850 --> 37:28.272
Why are you setting Florrick up?

37:28.330 --> 37:29.581
I'm not.

37:29.630 --> 37:31.234
I'm telling you the truth.

37:31.290 --> 37:32.939
No, you are lying.

37:32.980 --> 37:35.335
And you say that
up on the stand,

37:35.380 --> 37:36.722
you will be charged
with perjury.

37:36.770 --> 37:38.328
Are you threatening me?
No.

37:38.380 --> 37:40.462
I am just stating
the facts, ma'am.

37:40.510 --> 37:43.161
Next time you talk to the AUSA,

37:43.210 --> 37:45.258
I'd share that little fact.

37:47.520 --> 37:48.953
[phone ringing]

37:49.000 --> 37:51.218
[scoffs]

37:53.400 --> 37:54.389
Mr. Canning.

37:54.440 --> 37:55.953
Long time, no hear.

37:56.010 --> 37:57.227
Yes.

37:57.270 --> 37:59.226
I miss you, Alicia.

37:59.270 --> 38:00.703
How's everything going for you?

38:00.750 --> 38:02.229
Good, thank you.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.224
And you?

38:03.280 --> 38:05.271
Well, maybe you can help me.

38:05.320 --> 38:07.231
I'm representing Cary Agos,

38:07.280 --> 38:08.622
and I need to know
if Peter's gonna be loyal

38:08.670 --> 38:10.319
to his former deputy,

38:10.370 --> 38:13.100
keep him out of this
little legal mess or-or not.

38:13.160 --> 38:15.458
I have no idea,
but I will pass on the message.

38:15.510 --> 38:17.637
Maybe I should be asking if
he's gonna keep you out of it.

38:17.680 --> 38:20.205
I don't know
what you're talking about.

38:20.250 --> 38:21.638
You've had a lot of interaction

38:21.690 --> 38:23.726
with Lloyd Garber
over the years.

38:23.770 --> 38:26.330
You wrote him thank-you notes
for fund-raisers.

38:26.390 --> 38:27.209
Okay.

38:27.260 --> 38:28.420
And?

38:28.480 --> 38:29.640
You waived your
spousal privilege

38:29.690 --> 38:31.339
during the grand jury hearings,

38:31.390 --> 38:33.381
and, uh,
if the prosecutor asks you

38:33.440 --> 38:37.137
to testify about Peter's
relationship with Lloyd Garber,

38:37.180 --> 38:38.693
he could easily
turn it around on you.

38:38.750 --> 38:39.876
Good-bye, Mr. Canning.

38:39.920 --> 38:41.091
Which is why you need

38:41.140 --> 38:44.223
to think about giving Peter up.

38:47.360 --> 38:50.363
And there's the last joke.

38:50.410 --> 38:52.321
Where are you, huh?

38:52.370 --> 38:54.235
Where?

39:04.420 --> 39:05.819
Okay, this is it.
Good night.

39:05.860 --> 39:07.509
I didn't get to talk
to you all evening.

39:07.560 --> 39:12.076
Tell me why I should be a lawyer
in three words or less.

39:12.130 --> 39:13.643
You're...

39:13.690 --> 39:14.645
you're smart.

39:14.700 --> 39:18.522
Okay, I'll take that.

39:18.570 --> 39:19.525
We have to talk.

39:19.570 --> 39:20.821
I know.

39:20.880 --> 39:22.529
No, we reallyhave to talk.I know.

39:22.570 --> 39:26.006
This is in case we die tomorrow.

39:26.050 --> 39:27.790
Okay, let's not die tomorrow.

39:32.450 --> 39:33.405
See you at work.

39:35.460 --> 39:36.927
I like that.[chuckles]

39:36.980 --> 39:38.402
Thanks for everything.You're welcome.

39:38.460 --> 39:40.416
Maybe one day you can teach me
how to be happy.

39:40.460 --> 39:42.451
Not sure
I can teach you anything.

39:42.510 --> 39:43.499
[soft chuckle]

39:47.250 --> 39:48.205
Oh.

39:48.250 --> 39:49.945
Mm.

39:49.990 --> 39:51.207
I've been drinking.

39:51.250 --> 39:53.332
I can see that.

39:53.390 --> 39:55.608
Oh, you're such a good daughter.

39:55.650 --> 39:56.776
I love you.

39:56.820 --> 39:58.128
I love you, too.

39:58.170 --> 39:59.728
And I'm glad
you're leaving him

39:59.780 --> 40:01.509
and going with the hunk.

40:01.570 --> 40:03.526
Okay, Mom.
Thanks.

40:03.570 --> 40:04.787
I just want you to be happy.

40:04.830 --> 40:06.138
[voice breaking]:
Is that wrong?

40:06.180 --> 40:07.613
Where's Owen?
Oh, I'm here.

40:07.660 --> 40:11.130
Mm, I want you both
to be happy.

40:11.190 --> 40:12.259
You'll get her home safe?

40:12.320 --> 40:13.446
Of course.

40:13.490 --> 40:15.572
I love you.
I love you, too.

40:15.630 --> 40:17.973
And I love you both.

40:18.020 --> 40:19.976
It's the only good thing
about me.

40:20.020 --> 40:21.453

Alicia.

40:25.070 --> 40:27.459
Thank you, it was beautiful.

40:27.510 --> 40:29.068
Jackie, I'm glad you're happy.

40:29.120 --> 40:31.509
But I won't be seeing you again.

40:31.550 --> 40:33.598
Why not?

40:33.640 --> 40:35.426
You're divorcing my son.

40:35.470 --> 40:38.769
And I just wanted you to know,

40:38.820 --> 40:40.811
we're more alike than not.

40:40.870 --> 40:43.088
HOWARD:
Good night and thank you.

40:43.130 --> 40:45.826
This was, by far,
the best ketubah signing

40:45.870 --> 40:47.826
I've ever been to.

40:47.880 --> 40:48.869
Good night, Howard.

40:48.920 --> 40:49.909
Good night.

40:53.620 --> 40:55.053
We're leaving, Mom.

40:55.100 --> 40:56.533
I know.

40:56.580 --> 40:58.275
["Wave of Mutilation"

40:58.320 --> 41:00.094
Text me.

41:03.590 --> 41:05.490
Be good, please.

41:05.550 --> 41:08.496
I will.

41:11.550 --> 41:13.506
Cease to resist

41:13.550 --> 41:17.850
Giving my good-byes

41:17.910 --> 41:19.593
I don't want to die!

41:19.650 --> 41:21.299
Drive my car

41:21.340 --> 41:22.295
God!

41:22.340 --> 41:23.898
Into the ocean

41:23.950 --> 41:24.951
Mother!

41:25.000 --> 41:26.126
PETER:
No, you don't understand.

41:26.170 --> 41:27.512
I'm sorry!

41:27.570 --> 41:30.562
That's not a plea bargain.

41:30.610 --> 41:32.953
No, look,
even if I were guilty,

41:33.010 --> 41:34.614
I'd fight that, okay?

41:34.660 --> 41:36.651
On a wave of mutilation

41:36.710 --> 41:37.699
[sighs]

41:37.750 --> 41:38.705

41:38.750 --> 41:40.001
Did I miss Zach?

41:40.060 --> 41:41.709
Yeah, he left.

41:41.760 --> 41:43.967
He said he'd call you tomorrow.

41:44.020 --> 41:45.408
Is he going?

41:45.450 --> 41:46.530
To France?
Yeah.

41:46.590 --> 41:48.103
Yeah.

41:48.150 --> 41:51.677
[heavy sigh]
I'll talk to him.

41:51.720 --> 41:54.029
No. Don't.

41:54.070 --> 41:57.153
It's his mistake,
let him make it.

41:57.210 --> 41:59.201
I'm sorry.

42:00.300 --> 42:01.904
You look exhausted.

42:01.950 --> 42:04.510
I'll be out of your hair
in a second.
Don't worry.

42:04.560 --> 42:06.642
All I have is a kitchen
full of dirty dishes.

42:08.650 --> 42:10.823
I've kissed mermaids

42:10.870 --> 42:12.212
I rode the El Nio

42:12.260 --> 42:13.818
[sighs]

42:16.050 --> 42:17.779
What are we toasting to?

42:17.830 --> 42:19.650
Walked the sand

42:19.710 --> 42:21.098
