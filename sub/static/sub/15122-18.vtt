WEBVTT

00:04.805 --> 00:05.773
Hey, Jimmy.

00:05.839 --> 00:06.807
Hey, Hope.

00:06.874 --> 00:08.109
Burt.

00:12.113 --> 00:13.581
Prepare to die.

00:13.647 --> 00:16.117
(grunting)

00:17.351 --> 00:18.819
Kida.
Kida.

00:18.886 --> 00:20.588
What was that?
Oh, we're taking
the same

00:20.654 --> 00:22.256
Krav Maga class
at the community center.

00:22.323 --> 00:23.457
The instructor
encourages us

00:23.524 --> 00:25.025
to attack each other
in our free time.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.660
So that's why she's... Hey.

00:26.727 --> 00:28.762
There's that cute
chick again. You should

00:28.829 --> 00:30.198
man up and say
something to her.

00:30.264 --> 00:32.700
I don't know what
to talk about.
Um... talk
about racism.

00:32.766 --> 00:34.335
Everybody hates racism.

00:34.402 --> 00:35.469
No. Shoes.
Woman love shoes.

00:35.536 --> 00:36.837
That's stupid, Dad.
No, it's not.

00:36.904 --> 00:37.838
Hey.

00:37.905 --> 00:39.207
Fantastic shoes.

00:39.273 --> 00:41.509
That people of all colors
would love.

00:42.643 --> 00:44.312
This is Jimmy.

00:44.378 --> 00:45.613
Hi.

00:45.679 --> 00:46.880
Hi. I'm Zoey.

00:46.947 --> 00:48.449
And I want that shirt.

00:48.516 --> 00:49.883
Pancake's one
of my favorite bands.

00:49.950 --> 00:52.353
Oh, cool. Pancakes are one
of my favorite foods.

00:52.420 --> 00:53.921
BURT:
You know what?

00:53.987 --> 00:56.224
Maybe you two should see them or

00:56.290 --> 00:57.691
eat them together.

00:57.758 --> 00:59.393
You should see
or eat them together.

00:59.460 --> 01:01.295
Dad.
Actually,
I'd, um...

01:01.362 --> 01:02.796
I'd be up for either
of those possibilities.

01:02.863 --> 01:03.997
We could,

01:04.064 --> 01:05.499
but I should let you know

01:05.566 --> 01:07.401
that I kind of sort of
have a girlfriend.

01:07.468 --> 01:08.269
(mutters):
No, you don't.

01:08.336 --> 01:09.303
Her name is Sabrina.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.605
Anyway, it's
complicated.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.607
Excuse me. This whole thing with
Sabrina-- it's all in his head.

01:13.674 --> 01:14.775
She has a boyfriend.

01:14.842 --> 01:16.477
In fact, he hasn't been
with anybody

01:16.544 --> 01:18.112
since he knocked up
a serial killer.

01:18.179 --> 01:20.914
And she's been executed,
so he's totally available.

01:20.981 --> 01:22.015
Continue.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.217
(laughs)

01:23.284 --> 01:25.153
Why don't I just give you
my number?

01:25.219 --> 01:26.420
You can call me

01:26.487 --> 01:28.489
if your fake girlfriend
also gets executed.

01:28.556 --> 01:30.824
Stranger things
have happened.

01:32.493 --> 01:35.863
Oh, my God, you are such a wuss!

01:35.929 --> 01:36.897
(high-pitched yelling)

01:36.964 --> 01:39.433
I tap out.
I tap out.

01:43.171 --> 01:47.441
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh. *

01:50.144 --> 01:51.179
Hey, idiot.

01:51.245 --> 01:52.413
Wait till
you hear what

01:52.480 --> 01:54.382
stupid thing your
son did today.

01:54.448 --> 01:55.983
I don't think
we need to tell Mom.

01:56.049 --> 01:57.718
You know Zoey
from day care?

01:57.785 --> 01:59.520
She was totally coming on to
him, and he turned her down.

01:59.587 --> 02:01.121
Zoey, the Doberman Pinscher?

02:01.189 --> 02:01.955
No, no, no,
that's Cynthia.

02:02.022 --> 02:03.424
Oh.

02:03.491 --> 02:04.558
Zoey's the one with the
absolute perfect nose.

02:04.625 --> 02:05.893
Not too big,
not too small.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.195
What is it with you and noses?

02:07.261 --> 02:08.796
He's a nose man, Jimmy.

02:08.862 --> 02:10.564
Noses are the unsung hero
of the face.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.132
Ties the whole
thing together.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.835
Name one good-looking person
without a nose. Can't do it.

02:14.902 --> 02:17.471
Jimmy, I can't believe
you turned her down.

02:17.538 --> 02:18.872
I'm your mother, and I love you,

02:18.939 --> 02:20.374
but let's face it.
You're no prize.

02:20.441 --> 02:22.009
I can't go out with Zoey.

02:22.075 --> 02:23.844
Sabrina might think
I'm not available.
Right.

02:23.911 --> 02:25.279
Because Sabrina having
a boyfriend's

02:25.346 --> 02:26.714
really discouraged you.

02:26.780 --> 02:29.450
Yeah, you seem real happy
to keep pining for her.

02:29.517 --> 02:31.385
You pine, pine, pine,
but you don't do anything.

02:31.452 --> 02:32.953
You just sit there like a log.

02:33.020 --> 02:34.154
A pine log.

02:34.222 --> 02:36.290
Which is the worst
kind of log.

02:36.357 --> 02:37.958
Best log-- Yule.
Bet Yule? Brenner.

02:38.025 --> 02:40.093
Best Brenner? David.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.795
Best David. That's where
it starts to get complicated.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.197
Look, I know you guys

02:43.264 --> 02:45.466
don't believe me, but I'm gonna
make a move on Sabrina. I am.

02:45.533 --> 02:48.202
All right, I know how to spot
the crack in a relationship,

02:48.269 --> 02:49.603
and that's when
I drive in my wedge.

02:49.670 --> 02:52.906
Maw Maw, dinner's
almost ready.

02:52.973 --> 02:55.543
Want to come
out and eat?

02:55.609 --> 02:57.044
I don't know what's going on.

02:57.110 --> 02:59.513
This is day three of her being
underneath that desk.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.415
She thinks she's gonna
have puppies again.

03:01.482 --> 03:02.883
She can't stay
under there.

03:02.950 --> 03:04.885
Maw Maw, you can't try
pushing out puppies

03:04.952 --> 03:07.388
under my work station.

03:08.656 --> 03:09.723
Burt, stop it.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.825
She's obviously upset
about something.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.126
We need to figure out
what it is.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.562
All right.

03:14.628 --> 03:17.365
She's old,
her husband's dead,

03:17.431 --> 03:19.767
and, uh...
and she can't eat ribs...

03:19.833 --> 03:21.001
without a lot of help.

03:21.068 --> 03:23.371
Since the baby, we've all
been working so much.

03:23.437 --> 03:25.606
Maybe she's lonely.

03:25.673 --> 03:27.275
Maybe we could get her
another pet.

03:27.341 --> 03:29.209
I don't think I want
to do that again.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.848
Look at you.

03:34.915 --> 03:37.418
You look like the cat
who ate the canary.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.424
(coughing)

03:45.793 --> 03:47.761
Does Shelley have any tricks
for when the old people

03:47.828 --> 03:48.862
at her day care
get depressed?

03:48.929 --> 03:50.764
Oh, all the old people
seem pretty happy.
Hmm.

03:50.831 --> 03:52.333
Hey, maybe that's
what we should do.

03:52.400 --> 03:53.501
Yeah, she might
like being around

03:53.567 --> 03:54.768
people her age...

03:54.835 --> 03:57.170
Maw Maw?

03:57.237 --> 03:59.540
Hey, Maw Maw, we're gonna
take you to Shelley's tomorrow

03:59.607 --> 04:02.042
so you can hang out
with all the other old people.

04:02.109 --> 04:03.644
That sounds
like fun, huh?

04:03.711 --> 04:05.078
Come on,
why don't you come on out,

04:05.145 --> 04:06.179
and I'll pre-chew you some ribs?

04:06.246 --> 04:07.047
BURT:
Oh, I like

04:07.114 --> 04:08.416
to pre-chew the ribs.

04:08.482 --> 04:09.950
Whoa, it's my turn.
Dad did it last time.

04:10.017 --> 04:12.620
It's impossible to keep
everyone in this house happy.

04:13.921 --> 04:16.624
Oh, crap.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.659
My lunch got switched
with Maw Maw's.

04:18.726 --> 04:22.095
Got a fiber shake and a
Tupperware applesauce.

04:22.162 --> 04:24.231
I'm pretty sure it's full
of medicine I shouldn't have.

04:24.298 --> 04:25.366
(phone chirps)
Son of a bitch.

04:25.433 --> 04:27.234
I got a text from Wyatt.

04:27.301 --> 04:29.803
He can't come home this weekend
'cause he's got some frat party.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.439
He's so stupid.

04:31.505 --> 04:33.307
(gasps)
He knows how
to text Greek letters.

04:33.374 --> 04:35.309
Doesn't seem stupid to me.

04:35.376 --> 04:36.344
My God, Frank, could you

04:36.410 --> 04:37.244
possibly be more creepy?

04:37.311 --> 04:39.480
Oh, easily.

04:40.981 --> 04:43.917
What's so important, Wyatt can't
come home this weekend?

04:43.984 --> 04:46.286
Well, he's a social director
of his fraternity,

04:46.354 --> 04:48.856
and they're having some pimps
and hoes party this weekend.

04:48.922 --> 04:51.525
He has to be there.
Hey, he had to cancel
last week, too, right?

04:51.592 --> 04:53.627
SABRINA:
Yeah. Why?

04:53.694 --> 04:55.563
Just, you're his girlfriend,
but you're here

04:55.629 --> 04:58.399
and he's away at college,
you know... with the hoes.

04:58.466 --> 05:00.701
Oh, my God.

05:00.768 --> 05:02.803
Do you think
he's cheating on me?

05:02.870 --> 05:04.405
What, with, like,
a cheerleader or something?

05:04.472 --> 05:05.573
I have no idea.

05:05.639 --> 05:06.640
FRANK:
Primates are not meant

05:06.707 --> 05:08.241
to be faithful, Sabrina.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.344
There has to be one male leader

05:10.411 --> 05:12.580
served by five to ten
submissive females.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.982
Thank you, Frank.
That's very helpful.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.384
Honestly,

05:16.450 --> 05:19.086
do you think
that Wyatt is cheating on me?

05:19.152 --> 05:21.088
Who can say?

05:21.154 --> 05:23.357
That's just what happens with
long distance relationships.

05:23.424 --> 05:26.093
It's probably why
they almost never work.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.962
You know what? I'm gonna go
up there this weekend,

05:29.029 --> 05:30.197
and I'm gonna find out

05:30.263 --> 05:31.532
for myself.

05:33.200 --> 05:36.169
There's finally a crack
in their relationship.

05:36.236 --> 05:37.638
Time to make my move.

05:37.705 --> 05:39.373
Dude, stay away from her.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.575
I've been working on this
for, like, a year.

05:41.642 --> 05:43.811
Really?
Yeah.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.446
Okay, then.

05:45.513 --> 05:47.314
May the best man win.

05:47.381 --> 05:48.549
Okay, you're on.

05:51.051 --> 05:53.153
Forfeit.

05:53.220 --> 05:55.523
Whoa. That was intense.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.460
There is a lot of
medicine in this.

06:04.197 --> 06:07.468
You all thought I was wasting
my time with Sabrina, but I knew

06:07.535 --> 06:09.670
if I waited long enough,
I would get my chance.

06:09.737 --> 06:11.204
Who knows?
If she busts him cheating,

06:11.271 --> 06:12.473
we could be dating by Monday.

06:12.540 --> 06:14.041
No. You got to go
up there with her.

06:14.107 --> 06:15.142
She's gonna be crying.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.477
She's gonna need a hug.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.111
Your father's right.
If a cute girl

06:18.178 --> 06:20.614
like that's wandering around
a college campus needing a hug,

06:20.681 --> 06:21.882
there's gonna be a hundred guys

06:21.949 --> 06:24.752
and at least six women
willing to give it to her.

06:24.818 --> 06:26.954
I don't know.
What if Wyatt's not cheating?

06:27.020 --> 06:28.088
All college guys cheat

06:28.155 --> 06:29.757
when they're in long-distance
relationships.

06:29.823 --> 06:32.593
Why do you think I didn't let
your dad go off to college?

06:32.660 --> 06:34.027
'Cause he didn't graduate
high school?

06:34.094 --> 06:36.396
For your information,
there are universities

06:36.464 --> 06:38.065
that advertise
on late-night television

06:38.131 --> 06:39.700
that are willing
to overlook that.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.835
Plus, I got 1,540 on my SATs.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.370
I do really
good on tests

06:43.437 --> 06:44.705
where you fill in the dots.

06:44.772 --> 06:46.373
VIRGINIA:
Anyway, look, this is your shot.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.541
After she finds out
he's cheating,

06:47.608 --> 06:48.709
you just bring her back here

06:48.776 --> 06:51.011
for a little pity party,
you know?

06:51.078 --> 06:54.582
Light some candles,
give her her favorite ice cream.

06:54.648 --> 06:55.816
Maybe some hard
cranberry lemonade.

06:55.883 --> 06:57.685
BURT:
Then you rent

06:57.751 --> 06:59.453
whatever movie you think
you're gonna hate the most.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.621
She'll love it.

07:00.688 --> 07:03.223
All right,
I'll go and call Sabrina,

07:03.290 --> 07:06.159
and then I'll stop and rent
something with Katherine Heigl.

07:08.562 --> 07:10.498
MAW MAW:
* I want a man *

07:10.564 --> 07:12.566
* With a slow hand *

07:12.633 --> 07:16.203
* I want a lover
with an easy touch *

07:16.269 --> 07:19.907
* I want somebody
who will spend some time *

07:19.973 --> 07:23.744
* Not come and go
in a heated rush *

07:23.811 --> 07:26.847
* I want somebody
who will understand... *

07:26.914 --> 07:29.216
She's in a good mood.
Yeah.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.619
* I want a slow hand... *
She's been walking
on clouds

07:31.685 --> 07:33.353
ever since you picked her up
from Shelley's.

07:33.420 --> 07:35.723
Okay, here we go.

07:35.789 --> 07:38.225
One prune juice,
low-sugar grapefruit,

07:38.291 --> 07:39.727
or as I like to call it,

07:39.793 --> 07:41.562
a long, slow, comfortable poop.

07:41.629 --> 07:42.830
Two more
of those

07:42.896 --> 07:45.098
for me and
the lady here.

07:45.165 --> 07:46.399
Make mine a double.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.502
Sow my oats now.

07:48.569 --> 07:52.072
Next week, MacArthur's
sending my unit out to Korea.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.440
(imitates gun shooting)

07:53.507 --> 07:55.809
Whoa-oh, I'm so proud
of you boys.

07:55.876 --> 07:58.245
Going over
and fighting people, killing.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.448
I just play the piano

08:01.515 --> 08:04.484
and raise spirits at the USO.

08:04.552 --> 08:06.987
You're getting a
rise out of me now.

08:07.054 --> 08:09.322
I think.

08:09.389 --> 08:10.591
I'm Mel.

08:10.658 --> 08:12.325
I'm Barbara June.

08:12.392 --> 08:14.261
I can't remember my last name.

08:14.327 --> 08:17.030
Oh, nice to meet
you, Barbara.
Nice to meet you, too.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.198
Let me buy you a drink.

08:18.265 --> 08:21.301
Uh, two more of those
for me and the lady here.

08:21.368 --> 08:24.304
Make mine a double.

08:24.371 --> 08:25.405
I'm Mel.

08:25.472 --> 08:26.907
Oh, I'm Barbara June.

08:26.974 --> 08:28.876
Can't remember my last name.

08:28.942 --> 08:33.614
Hey, I was gonna give
the new girl a drink.

08:33.681 --> 08:35.282
Hey, back off, pencil neck.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.651
(groaning)

08:37.718 --> 08:40.087
Maw Maw met a man?
Yup.

08:40.153 --> 08:42.790
Just don't let my husband
Wilfred hear about this.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.759
Oh, it would kill him. Ugh!

08:48.028 --> 08:50.964
I don't think you're gonna have
to worry about that.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.133
I don't care. Maw Maw is not
going back to Shelley's.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.768
I sent her there
for day care,

08:54.835 --> 08:56.737
not for a geriatric hookup.

08:56.804 --> 08:59.272
I don't see the problem.
It's sweet. Two people

08:59.339 --> 09:00.373
making each other happy.

09:00.440 --> 09:01.975
Sweet? You think it's sweet

09:02.042 --> 09:03.877
that she's cheating
on her husband?

09:03.944 --> 09:05.245
But her husband's dead.

09:05.312 --> 09:06.546
She doesn't know that.

09:06.614 --> 09:08.281
She thinks
she's having an affair.

09:08.348 --> 09:09.549
Oh, I just...

09:09.617 --> 09:13.253
Look, imagine we're
at the store,

09:13.320 --> 09:17.257
and you see me sneak a candy
bar into my purse, right?

09:17.324 --> 09:19.960
So you go pay for the candy
bar without telling me.

09:20.027 --> 09:21.629
How much was it?
Uh... 50 cents.

09:21.695 --> 09:24.031
Aah, I don't like this.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.667
What's going on with us that
you can't ask me for 50 cents?

09:26.734 --> 09:28.268
It's a hypodermic situation.

09:28.335 --> 09:31.404
Okay? The point is,
is it still stealing

09:31.471 --> 09:34.041
if the person who took it
thinks they were stealing?

09:34.107 --> 09:35.943
I guess... yeah.

09:36.009 --> 09:38.178
That-that person
would be a thief.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.981
So, if Maw Maw thinks
she's still married,

09:41.048 --> 09:43.383
then going with
Mel would be...?

09:43.450 --> 09:46.820
Cheating.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.355
Wow.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.190
All right.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.192
Yeah, I get it.

09:54.061 --> 09:55.128
Huh.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.163
Ugh!

09:56.229 --> 09:57.330
Ding.

09:57.397 --> 09:58.666
(sighs)

09:58.732 --> 10:00.267
It's hypothetical, by the way.

10:00.333 --> 10:01.268
What did I say?

10:01.334 --> 10:02.970
Hypodermic.
Whatever.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.672
It's a stupid
word anyway.

10:07.741 --> 10:09.777
Uh, listen Sergeant,

10:09.843 --> 10:11.779
I'll need a ride
to the officers' club

10:11.845 --> 10:13.981
to see my boyfriend, Mel.

10:14.047 --> 10:17.150
Okay, Maw Maw, you're not
coming out right now.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.786
Okay, I'm gonna go
run a couple errands,

10:18.852 --> 10:21.221
and I'll see you when
I get back, okay?

10:24.057 --> 10:25.192
You're lying,
aren't you?

10:25.258 --> 10:27.294
You're not really coming
back to get her?

10:27.360 --> 10:28.595
'Course not.

10:28.662 --> 10:30.831
After a while, she'll forget
what she's waiting for,

10:30.898 --> 10:33.667
and then, hopefully, by the time
we get back from work,

10:33.734 --> 10:34.968
she will have completely
forgotten Mel.

10:35.035 --> 10:36.804
You know how her mind works.

10:36.870 --> 10:39.339
It's like a mouse
on a wheel.

10:39.406 --> 10:41.641
Except the wheel spins sideways,

10:41.709 --> 10:43.176
the mouse is blind

10:43.243 --> 10:45.412
and has a really bad
sprained ankle.

10:48.581 --> 10:50.583
Burt!

10:50.650 --> 10:52.920
Don't be soft.

11:04.431 --> 11:05.766
Oh...

11:09.937 --> 11:12.139
(laughing):
There you are.

11:13.707 --> 11:15.208
I've been sitting here,
wondering

11:15.275 --> 11:17.077
what I'd do when
I got you all to myself.

11:17.144 --> 11:19.546
Oh, me, too,
my darling.

11:19.612 --> 11:22.716
My mind has been
a whirlwind.

11:22.783 --> 11:23.917
Oh...

11:26.720 --> 11:28.021
(snoring)

11:28.088 --> 11:28.956
(snoring)

11:33.560 --> 11:35.295
I swear to God, Jimmy,

11:35.362 --> 11:36.363
if I catch him cheating,

11:36.429 --> 11:38.198
I might just sleep
with the next guy I see.

11:39.967 --> 11:41.368
That makes sense.

11:41.434 --> 11:43.036
I might even sleep
with the next ten guys I see.

11:45.105 --> 11:47.040
Maybe start with one.

11:47.107 --> 11:48.942
MAN (on radio):
And that is yet another example

11:49.009 --> 11:50.543
of our Big Brother Government

11:50.610 --> 11:53.280
covering up the impending
disaster of 2012.

11:53.346 --> 11:54.782
(cell phone rings)

11:54.848 --> 11:56.149
Hello?

11:56.216 --> 11:58.418
Hi, Virginia.
It's me. Shelly.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.453
Hope's fine. Hey,
I just need to know,

12:00.520 --> 12:03.123
at what base do you need me
to stop Maw Maw and Mel?

12:03.190 --> 12:04.992
They're really ramping
up the canoodling,

12:05.058 --> 12:07.394
and I just wanted to
clarify any boundaries.

12:07.460 --> 12:08.428
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:08.495 --> 12:11.064
Maw Maw's
at your day care with Mel?

12:12.632 --> 12:14.234
All right,
come with me.

12:14.301 --> 12:15.135
Who are you?

12:15.202 --> 12:16.536
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

12:16.603 --> 12:17.637
You're a married woman.

12:17.704 --> 12:19.606
Who the hell are
you? Let me go.

12:19.672 --> 12:20.774
Hey!

12:20.841 --> 12:22.943
Hey! Leave her alone.

12:26.013 --> 12:27.380
I'll see you tomorrow.

12:27.447 --> 12:29.749
* *

12:36.556 --> 12:37.590
Wow.

12:37.657 --> 12:39.893
If my guidance counselor
showed me pictures of this.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.862
I might have studied
harder in high school.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.696
There he is.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.033
* *

12:48.635 --> 12:50.270
He's sitting all alone.

12:50.337 --> 12:52.139
He even looks bored.

12:52.205 --> 12:54.341
I'm gonna go over there
and surprise him.

12:54.407 --> 12:57.010
Jimmy, thank you so much
for driving me up here.

12:57.077 --> 12:58.445
If we'd have
just stayed home,

12:58.511 --> 13:00.147
who knows what kind of crazy
thing I would have done,

13:00.213 --> 13:01.681
thinking he was
cheating on me.

13:01.748 --> 13:03.516
Yeah.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.152
Do I look okay?

13:05.218 --> 13:07.120
Great.

13:07.187 --> 13:09.289
Okay.

13:09.356 --> 13:11.324
* *

13:24.037 --> 13:25.705
This is incredible...

13:25.772 --> 13:27.240
...-bly awful.

13:28.775 --> 13:30.443
I'll be right back.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.012
Wyatt.

13:32.079 --> 13:34.347
Sabrina. I...

13:34.414 --> 13:36.349
(groans)

13:36.416 --> 13:37.250
Hi, Wyatt.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.385
Oh...

13:38.451 --> 13:39.252
Let's go, Jimmy.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.888
So, what kind of ice
cream do you like?

13:40.954 --> 13:42.622
I've got pistachio
and chocolate chip,

13:42.689 --> 13:44.291
but we can get whatever.

13:46.426 --> 13:47.861
I don't understand
what you're so mad about.

13:47.928 --> 13:51.498
Because we agreed she wasn't
going back to Shelly's.

13:51.564 --> 13:53.066
I know, but it was so sad,

13:53.133 --> 13:54.567
and the more
I thought about it,

13:54.634 --> 13:56.970
it seemed crazy that someone
could cheat on a dead person.

13:57.037 --> 13:58.205
And you got me
all mixed up

13:58.271 --> 13:59.639
with that candy bar story

13:59.706 --> 14:01.074
and that thing
you do with your hands

14:01.141 --> 14:02.842
where I get all mesmerized

14:02.910 --> 14:05.078
and then I-I...

14:05.145 --> 14:07.480
Start to realize
that I'm...

14:07.547 --> 14:08.781
Right.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.783
And... No! Wrong!

14:10.850 --> 14:12.652
See? Damn it.
Stop doing that.

14:12.719 --> 14:14.787
It's crazy to call it cheating
if the other person's dead.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.623
Is that your plan?

14:16.689 --> 14:18.091
Are you even going

14:18.158 --> 14:20.360
to wait until
my body's cold,

14:20.427 --> 14:21.628
or just hook up

14:21.694 --> 14:23.530
with some sexy paramedic
while she's trying

14:23.596 --> 14:24.564
to jump-start my heart?

14:24.631 --> 14:26.766
Plan? I don't have a plan.
Really?

14:26.833 --> 14:29.402
You never thought about what
you'd do if I died first?

14:29.469 --> 14:30.837
What? Ew!

14:30.904 --> 14:32.539
I don't want to think
about you dead.

14:32.605 --> 14:33.941
That's so sad.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.609
Do you think about me dead?

14:38.445 --> 14:39.612
Occasionally.

14:39.679 --> 14:40.948
But only because

14:41.014 --> 14:42.549
you're such a sound sleeper.

14:42.615 --> 14:44.551
You just look dead.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.319
So my mind just
goes there.

14:46.386 --> 14:49.289
Is that what all this
with Maw Maw's about?

14:49.356 --> 14:52.425
You're worried about what I'm
gonna do if you die first?

14:52.492 --> 14:53.493
Maybe.

14:53.560 --> 14:54.794
A little.

14:54.861 --> 14:56.496
Aw...

14:56.563 --> 14:57.797
So?

14:57.864 --> 15:00.067
Are you gonna be
with other women?

15:00.133 --> 15:01.634
Well, I've never
thought about it,

15:01.701 --> 15:03.703
but... Like who?

15:03.770 --> 15:05.238
Anybody.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.274
Jennifer from
the dry cleaners.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.642
Okay. Uh...

15:09.709 --> 15:11.244
Um...

15:11.311 --> 15:12.612
We're on a date.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.881
We're talking
about dry cleaning.

15:14.948 --> 15:17.150
Whoa.
Now we're home.

15:17.217 --> 15:18.918
In our room.
That was quick.

15:18.986 --> 15:20.853
And now... Oh.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.822
I-I don't like this.

15:22.889 --> 15:24.757
No. Stop! I...

15:24.824 --> 15:26.126
Jennifer!

15:26.193 --> 15:28.128
(gasps)
No means no!

15:29.929 --> 15:31.364
That was awful.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.100
Why did you make
me think that?

15:33.166 --> 15:36.136
Because I need to know if you
could be with somebody else.

15:36.203 --> 15:38.171
Well, I can't.
You're it.

15:38.238 --> 15:40.173
You're it for me forever.

15:40.240 --> 15:43.110
You're it for me
forever, too.

15:44.144 --> 15:47.314
If, God forbid,
you go first,

15:47.380 --> 15:49.816
I think I'm gonna
have you stuffed

15:49.882 --> 15:51.484
and put in that
corner right there.

15:51.551 --> 15:55.055
And on cold nights,

15:55.122 --> 15:57.090
I'll take you into our bed.
Oh, Burt.

15:57.157 --> 16:00.493
Let's not mess up
a good moment.

16:12.372 --> 16:13.340
(sighs)

16:13.406 --> 16:15.375
Wyatt's still
following us.

16:15.442 --> 16:17.044
I have nothing to say to him.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.445
Don't stop this van.

16:21.614 --> 16:22.782
I won't.

16:22.849 --> 16:24.084
Except that we
need some gas.

16:24.151 --> 16:25.485
Your gauge says half full.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.987
Yeah. The little arrow's broken.

16:28.055 --> 16:29.556
What? You don't keep track
of your miles?

16:29.622 --> 16:32.325
Yeah. The mileage thingy
is also broken.

16:32.392 --> 16:34.061
And I'm not sure...

16:34.127 --> 16:36.563
(engine sputtering)

16:36.629 --> 16:38.365
Now I'm sure.

16:46.806 --> 16:49.342
Look, just let me explain
why I kissed that...

16:49.409 --> 16:50.710
Can you only be quiet

16:50.777 --> 16:52.245
when you have a mouth full
of slut tongue?

16:52.312 --> 16:55.382
Just shut up and drive us
to the gas station.

16:56.683 --> 16:59.052
So...

16:59.119 --> 17:00.487
Uh...

17:00.553 --> 17:02.322
Looks like you have
a lot of fun over there,

17:02.389 --> 17:03.723
Triangle B. Triangle.

17:03.790 --> 17:06.826
(tires squealing)
What-what are you doing?

17:06.893 --> 17:08.995
You're in the wrong lane.
The wrong lane.

17:09.062 --> 17:11.664
I'm staying in this lane until
you listen to me explain.

17:11.731 --> 17:13.566
Oh, please.
You don't have the guts.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.635
He might.
He might have the guts.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.837
No. He wouldn't mess up that
pretty little face of his.

17:17.904 --> 17:18.738
Yes, I would.

17:18.805 --> 17:20.240
He said he would.
He said he would.

17:20.307 --> 17:21.641
Just maybe you should
let him explain himself.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.676
Wyatt, if you could just pull
back over to our side.

17:23.743 --> 17:24.911
Sabrina, you really need to
listen to what he has to say.

17:24.977 --> 17:26.146
Fine.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.280
I only kissed
that stupid girl

17:27.347 --> 17:29.116
because you cheated
on me with Jimmy.

17:29.182 --> 17:31.351
Oh, please.
Me?

17:31.418 --> 17:32.952
She told me last week that she
kissed you on Halloween.

17:33.019 --> 17:34.121
And I told you

17:34.187 --> 17:35.122
that I was so drunk

17:35.188 --> 17:36.223
that I thought
I was kissing you.

17:36.289 --> 17:37.857
Jimmy was drunk, too.

17:37.924 --> 17:39.592
We had no idea
what was going on.

17:39.659 --> 17:42.595
Yeah. I mean, I kind of
remember kissing someone

17:42.662 --> 17:44.431
and her telling me
that it was really great.

17:44.497 --> 17:45.765
And wow.

17:45.832 --> 17:47.534
I mean, that was you?
How'd you find out it was me?

17:47.600 --> 17:49.902
Well, I kind of figured it out
when I woke up at your house.

17:49.969 --> 17:51.204
My mouth tasted
like Big League Chew.

17:51.271 --> 17:52.239
You're the only adult

17:52.305 --> 17:53.906
I know that still chews
that stuff.

17:53.973 --> 17:55.875
It makes me feel
like I'm in the Big Leagues.

17:55.942 --> 17:57.277
Okay, off topic.

17:57.344 --> 17:58.445
Point is...
Oh, God! Headlights!

17:58.511 --> 18:00.247
Headlights! Headlights!
Oh, God.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.282
(laughing nervously)

18:02.349 --> 18:05.418
Thank God. They saw the
headlights and they swerved.

18:07.987 --> 18:09.622
What? Okay.

18:09.689 --> 18:12.024
Look, this thing
is clearly my fault.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.093
You guys obviously have
something very, very special.

18:14.161 --> 18:15.462
And-and me kissing
you on Halloween?

18:15.528 --> 18:17.096
That started
this whole crazy mess.

18:17.164 --> 18:18.898
Now, now,
this is totally my fault.

18:18.965 --> 18:20.099
Not Wyatt.

18:20.167 --> 18:21.801
All right, Sabrina,

18:21.868 --> 18:22.669
this is a great, great guy,

18:22.735 --> 18:24.804
and-and-and he deserves
a second chance.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.343
(crickets chirping)

18:32.779 --> 18:35.415
Jimmy, thank you so much.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.584
You stopped me from making
such a huge mistake.

18:49.829 --> 18:50.663
Oh!

18:50.730 --> 18:52.499
You're the hot chick
with the nose.

18:52.565 --> 18:53.433
What?

18:53.500 --> 18:55.202
It's a conversation
we were having.

18:55.268 --> 18:56.503
Listen, this is
my grandmother.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.205
I think she's friends
with your, um...

18:58.271 --> 18:59.772
Oh, yeah. My
grandfather Mel.

18:59.839 --> 19:00.707
Mel. Mel.

19:00.773 --> 19:02.309
Is there something
we can do for you?

19:02.375 --> 19:04.177
I was keeping them apart
for reasons

19:04.244 --> 19:05.745
I really don't need
to get into right now.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.314
But I realized

19:07.380 --> 19:09.249
I just really want her
to be happy again.

19:09.316 --> 19:10.583
So, basically,

19:10.650 --> 19:12.752
I'm here with my
84-year-old grandmother

19:12.819 --> 19:15.222
for a late-night booty call.

19:15.288 --> 19:17.257
This is awkward.

19:17.324 --> 19:19.426
Uh, he talked to
an Asian woman

19:19.492 --> 19:20.927
at the coffee place,

19:20.993 --> 19:22.762
and somehow thinks

19:22.829 --> 19:23.930
he's back in Korea.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.598
He's a little batty.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.300
Barbara Jean, what
are you doing here?

19:27.367 --> 19:28.368
What am I doing here?

19:28.435 --> 19:29.702
What is she doing here?

19:29.769 --> 19:32.038
Who?

19:32.104 --> 19:34.274
Oh, her? She's
a-a local.

19:34.341 --> 19:35.342
(stammering)

19:35.408 --> 19:37.477
Hey, things happen
during wartime.

19:37.544 --> 19:38.945
Doesn't mean anything.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.413
You said
you loved me.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.315
GIs say a lot of things, baby.

19:42.382 --> 19:45.352
How'd you even find me here,
in the middle of this jungle?

19:45.418 --> 19:47.654
I gave you discount
on Danish.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.422
Come on. You're making
this hard on all of us.

19:49.489 --> 19:51.291
Why's he talking
about the jungle?

19:51.358 --> 19:52.859
He think he shipped
out already?

19:52.925 --> 19:54.294
We're still stateside.

19:54.361 --> 19:55.895
Hey, hey, hey.
You're gonna have to leave.

19:55.962 --> 19:58.898
I just heard that there's
an enemy sneak attack coming.

19:58.965 --> 20:01.368
This one can't keep
her mouth closed.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.002
Or her legs.

20:03.069 --> 20:05.305
Well, they are closed now.

20:05.372 --> 20:07.240
Oh, come on, baby.

20:07.307 --> 20:10.877
Don't be that way.

20:10.943 --> 20:12.912
Seniors in love, man.

20:12.979 --> 20:14.547
It's a goat rodeo.

20:14.614 --> 20:16.416
Yep.

20:17.484 --> 20:19.619
Well, it's sad.

20:19.686 --> 20:22.322
I seen a lot of boys
come back from the war

20:22.389 --> 20:23.690
with their
heads all screwy.

20:23.756 --> 20:26.192
But this one hasn't
even left town yet.

20:26.259 --> 20:28.261
Well, breaks your
heart, you know.

20:28.328 --> 20:31.331
Yes, it does.

20:38.104 --> 20:40.573
War.

20:40.640 --> 20:43.109
It's not just hard
on the soldiers.

20:43.175 --> 20:45.678
Yeah, well,

20:45.745 --> 20:48.281
maybe Korea will be
the last one, Maw Maw.

20:48.348 --> 20:50.483
They wouldn't call it
"falling in love"

20:50.550 --> 20:52.719
if you didn't
get hurt sometimes.

20:54.287 --> 20:55.788
But you just

20:55.855 --> 20:59.292
pick yourself up
and move on.

20:59.359 --> 21:01.894
Plenty of other fish
in the sea.

21:08.301 --> 21:09.402
Red Hot Chili Peppers.

21:09.469 --> 21:10.770
Black Eyed Peas.
Korn.

21:10.837 --> 21:11.804
Phish.
Cake.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.440
Meat Loaf.
Eminem.
Wings.

21:13.506 --> 21:15.141
Ha.
Nice.

21:15.207 --> 21:17.944
Well, there really are a lot
of bands named after foods.

21:18.010 --> 21:19.479
Salt-N-Pepa.

21:19.546 --> 21:20.980
If I give you that, you got
to give me Limp Bizkit.

21:21.047 --> 21:22.048
Deal.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.983
Jimmy?

21:24.050 --> 21:26.018
Hey. I didn't know
you were into Pancake.

21:26.085 --> 21:27.554
Who's your date?

21:27.620 --> 21:30.056
(coughing, muffled):
We're just friends.

21:33.860 --> 21:36.463
Duh... winning!
