WEBVTT

02:41.578 --> 02:43.246
There they go again.

02:43.789 --> 02:47.500
- You think we should do something?
- What should we do?

02:48.001 --> 02:50.336
What's going on?

02:50.420 --> 02:53.714
I don't know. He walked up
and started going off on her again.

02:54.591 --> 02:55.925
Hey.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.014
Get your hands off her!

03:03.016 --> 03:05.810
I swear to God, you put your
hands on her one more time...

03:07.437 --> 03:09.188
Get your hands off me!

06:39.733 --> 06:41.484
Michael?

06:44.946 --> 06:46.072
I'm sorry.

06:49.493 --> 06:51.077
Don't worry.

06:51.828 --> 06:54.830
I stuck my nose
where it didn't belong.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.248
It's on me.

06:56.333 --> 06:57.875
You must understand.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.585
I got to get this raft finished

06:59.669 --> 07:01.545
so I can get my boy
and take him home.

07:01.630 --> 07:04.590
When I slapped you,
I was protecting you.

07:04.674 --> 07:06.592
- Yeah? From what?
- From Jin.

07:07.844 --> 07:10.471
You don't know what he's capable of.

07:12.390 --> 07:15.434
It's not my problem. It's yours.

07:36.331 --> 07:38.624
Why don't you try sea urchin?

07:38.708 --> 07:40.793
They got more ping.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.211
Hey.

07:47.759 --> 07:51.971
I know things got kind of nasty
down there at the beach.

07:52.055 --> 07:55.641
I don't want to get involved
in husband and wife stuff,

07:55.725 --> 07:58.060
but I figured, you know,

07:58.145 --> 08:00.354
you might need to relax.

08:00.856 --> 08:02.398
So...

08:08.822 --> 08:11.240
Come on, dude, I'm trying here.

08:12.701 --> 08:14.201
Okay.

08:16.329 --> 08:19.665
You want to be an outsider?
It's your business.

08:27.382 --> 08:29.758
I tied this side down.

08:30.302 --> 08:32.635
Do you think
this is gonna hold?

08:32.721 --> 08:36.849
Do you have a past in the Navy
you've neglected to tell me about?

08:36.933 --> 08:39.058
- Why?
- How does a woman like you

08:39.144 --> 08:41.187
learn how to tie
a perfect bowline knot?

08:41.270 --> 08:43.480
By dating guys with sailboats.

08:47.027 --> 08:50.070
Since you bring it up, I've been
worried since I first met you

08:50.155 --> 08:51.822
that you might end up a spinster.

08:52.532 --> 08:56.118
Spending my Saturday nights
alone at home tying knots?

08:56.203 --> 08:57.995
Perhaps with an overweight aunt.

08:59.539 --> 09:00.915
It's a very sad image.

09:02.250 --> 09:07.087
Maybe we should get some rope,
spend a Saturday night alone together,

09:07.172 --> 09:08.923
and see what happens.

09:16.848 --> 09:18.140
Dad?

09:19.643 --> 09:20.976
Thanks.

09:22.354 --> 09:26.357
You are gonna love New York, Walt.
No city like it.

09:26.441 --> 09:28.025
What I really want to show you

09:28.109 --> 09:30.736
- are the buildings, architecture.
- Buildings?

09:30.820 --> 09:33.197
I said that,
till I saw the Flatiron Building.

09:33.281 --> 09:35.950
- What's that?
- Oldest skyscraper in the city.

09:36.034 --> 09:37.243
Built in 1902.

09:37.327 --> 09:40.079
And it's flat.
That one building inspired me

09:40.163 --> 09:42.164
to start drawing
and designing things.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.416
- Why?
- You just gotta see it.

09:44.501 --> 09:47.086
- You want to see it, right?
- I guess.

09:47.170 --> 09:49.546
Can I go throw the ball to Vincent?

09:50.966 --> 09:53.008
Yeah. Sure. Of course.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.387
Come on, Vincent!

09:58.765 --> 10:00.808
Wow, you're making a lot of progress.

10:00.892 --> 10:03.143
- Yeah, trying.
- It's pretty cool.

10:03.853 --> 10:06.272
Got this bamboo for the decking,

10:06.356 --> 10:10.025
got a piece of the fuselage
for a cabin.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.945
Some storage bins.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.781
What's up?

10:15.865 --> 10:18.033
I thought I'd give you the heads-up.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.326
Yeah?

10:19.411 --> 10:22.955
There's a lot of talk going on about
who's going on this thing with you.

10:23.832 --> 10:26.625
Hey, man,
it's not the Queen Mary.

10:26.710 --> 10:30.212
I only got room for four people.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.714
There's one open spot.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.632
Who took the other one?

10:33.717 --> 10:35.801
What's the matter, doc?

10:35.885 --> 10:37.845
Feeling left out?

10:38.680 --> 10:40.639
- You're taking Sawyer?
- Yep.

10:40.724 --> 10:43.642
Bought myself a ticket
on this little tub.

10:43.727 --> 10:47.104
Let me tell you,
the fare was steep.

10:47.188 --> 10:50.816
Could have used that cable
to hold up my new beach house.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.609
You sold him a spot?

10:52.694 --> 10:55.154
I needed halyards for the mast.

10:55.238 --> 10:58.991
Good thing I'm a saver,
not a spender.

11:06.166 --> 11:09.168
How much longer are you gonna
let him treat you this way?

11:09.919 --> 11:11.378
- Please...
- Sun.

11:13.048 --> 11:14.256
He's my husband.

11:14.341 --> 11:17.217
A husband you're afraid to tell
you speak English.

11:18.261 --> 11:20.596
I'm trying to understand.

11:21.556 --> 11:24.224
He wasn't always like this.

11:26.603 --> 11:29.813
He used to tell me
how beautiful I looked to him.

11:31.775 --> 11:33.650
He was so tender.

11:38.156 --> 11:40.532
And then he was different.

11:41.618 --> 11:43.577
What changed him?

11:46.081 --> 11:47.831
Need some help!

11:52.837 --> 11:55.047
Hey, Charlie,
what's going on?

11:55.131 --> 11:57.341
The raft, it's on fire. Look.

12:16.528 --> 12:18.987
No! No!

12:30.667 --> 12:31.792
Where is he?

12:32.669 --> 12:34.294
Where the hell is he?

12:39.175 --> 12:40.467
Where is he?

12:42.595 --> 12:44.513
- Where is he?
- She doesn't understand.

12:44.597 --> 12:47.558
- Hey! Where is he?
- Back off.

12:47.642 --> 12:49.309
Her husband did this.
She knows!

12:49.394 --> 12:51.019
You trying to protect him now?

12:51.104 --> 12:53.105
- She was with me!
- No, Walt!

12:53.189 --> 12:55.232
Get back.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.109
- No, it's done.
- Sun, wait!

12:57.193 --> 12:58.944
I'm gonna break his damn neck!

12:59.028 --> 13:02.531
- Just take it easy, man.
- We don't know that Jin did this.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.867
- Are you serious?
- Sawyer, shut up!

13:04.951 --> 13:08.287
- We saw him on the beach.
- That doesn't mean he torched the raft.

13:08.371 --> 13:09.788
Yeah, then who did?

16:27.654 --> 16:29.237
What do you want?

16:31.449 --> 16:33.742
I'd like to talk to you about Shannon.

16:37.038 --> 16:38.914
It's very possible your sister and I

16:38.998 --> 16:41.500
are going to become
more than just friends.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.711
What is this,

16:45.588 --> 16:47.673
some Middle Eastern thing?

16:47.757 --> 16:50.258
You want my blessing
or something?

16:51.427 --> 16:54.429
- My hope is you won't object.
- Yeah?

16:59.352 --> 17:02.896
I was extending a courtesy,
not asking your permission.

17:03.439 --> 17:05.607
Let me tell you about my sister.

17:07.902 --> 17:10.779
She likes older men,
guys that can take care of her.

17:11.781 --> 17:14.741
My guess is in this place
you fit the bill.

17:16.035 --> 17:20.038
She'll make you feel like the greatest
while you get her whatever she needs,

17:20.123 --> 17:23.625
and once she gets what
she wants, she'll move on.

17:25.420 --> 17:26.962
When she does,

17:28.631 --> 17:30.841
don't take it personally, man.

17:58.828 --> 18:00.454
Messed up my ride, chief.

18:14.010 --> 18:15.635
Hey, there you are.

18:15.720 --> 18:18.680
Come help me with this.
I'm completely destroying it.

18:21.434 --> 18:25.687
- You seem to be doing just fine.
- Yeah, fine at making it collapse.

18:25.772 --> 18:28.231
You're very capable.

18:28.316 --> 18:31.026
I'm sure you'd be all right
building it on your own.

18:35.281 --> 18:36.740
What's going on?

18:39.494 --> 18:43.038
Perhaps you should find another friend

18:43.122 --> 18:45.749
to help you with your shelter.

18:50.254 --> 18:52.297
You've been talking to my brother.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.267
Oh, gross!

19:04.769 --> 19:07.187
Gross to you, dinner to me.

19:07.688 --> 19:10.106
Boone, where is he?

19:10.191 --> 19:12.067
- Don't know.
- You don't know?

19:12.151 --> 19:15.570
- You two are like jungle pals.
- Sorry. I haven't seen him.

19:15.655 --> 19:18.490
Well, if you do see him,
tell him to keep his mouth shut.

19:18.574 --> 19:21.034
If he has something to say,
leave Sayid out of it

19:21.118 --> 19:23.829
- and say it to my face.
- Should I be writing this down?

19:23.913 --> 19:27.499
Just tell him to stay
the hell out of my business.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.084
Do you like him?

19:30.670 --> 19:33.421
- What?
- Sayid.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.259
Are you serious?

19:38.427 --> 19:41.721
Because if you do like him,

19:41.806 --> 19:44.015
what's it got to do with your brother?

19:45.935 --> 19:48.979
You're a grown woman.
Sure, you can yell at Boone,

19:49.063 --> 19:51.898
but all you're doing
is giving him what he wants.

19:53.025 --> 19:56.152
- Yeah, what's that?
- Your attention.

19:58.948 --> 20:03.451
Everyone gets a new life on this island.

20:05.454 --> 20:08.206
Maybe it's time you start yours.

20:16.674 --> 20:18.425
You must be pretty scared.

20:18.509 --> 20:21.177
Scared. You understand
scared, don't you?

20:24.640 --> 20:26.349
If you ain't,

20:26.434 --> 20:28.143
you're gonna be, Bruce.

20:28.811 --> 20:33.148
Folks down on the beach might have been
doctors and accountants a month ago,

20:33.232 --> 20:35.942
but it's Lord of the Flies time now.

26:02.895 --> 26:06.397
- Michael! Take it easy!
- I'll take it easy, all right!

26:06.482 --> 26:08.191
Hang on, man!

26:08.275 --> 26:11.736
- Hey, you burned my raft?
- Just calm down.

26:11.820 --> 26:14.405
- Hey, step aside.
- Just calm down!

26:14.490 --> 26:16.824
You burned my raft?
Why'd you burn my raft, man?

26:16.909 --> 26:18.868
Calm down and think about it a minute.

26:18.953 --> 26:20.995
- Look at his hands.
- Back off, Jack.

26:21.080 --> 26:23.331
Shut it!
Everyone's gotta chill out!

26:45.854 --> 26:47.563
What'd he say?

26:51.068 --> 26:52.360
You say something to me?

26:54.196 --> 26:56.781
Say it again.
No, no, say it again, man!

27:03.205 --> 27:04.914
- Hey!
- Easy, doc!

27:04.999 --> 27:08.710
- One fight at a time.
- He's right. This is between them.

27:44.997 --> 27:46.622
Stop it!

27:47.499 --> 27:49.917
Leave him alone!

28:00.971 --> 28:03.931
He didn't burn your raft.

28:18.614 --> 28:21.657
- You speak English?
- Didn't see that coming.

28:21.742 --> 28:25.203
You understood us all this time?
Why didn't you say anything?

28:25.287 --> 28:28.873
Your raft was already
on fire when he arrived.

28:28.957 --> 28:31.709
He burned his hands
trying to put it out.

28:31.794 --> 28:33.503
Then why did he run?

28:45.557 --> 28:47.725
Exactly. That's what I thought.

28:47.810 --> 28:52.063
My husband is many things,
but he is not a liar.

28:52.147 --> 28:54.899
You're gonna lecture us
about lying, Betty?

28:54.983 --> 28:56.526
From the look on his face,

28:56.610 --> 28:59.695
even your old man here
didn't know you speak English.

28:59.780 --> 29:03.199
- How do we know she's not covering?
- Because she isn't!

29:05.994 --> 29:08.788
- Why would he burn the raft?
- He's been after me!

29:08.872 --> 29:11.332
- Everybody knows it!
- Okay, it's personal.

29:11.417 --> 29:14.419
Why take it out on our best chance
at getting off the island?

29:16.046 --> 29:18.714
Why would any one of us
block an attempt to get home?

29:19.675 --> 29:22.468
We're so intent on pointing
the finger at one another

29:22.553 --> 29:25.680
that we're ignoring
the simple undeniable truth

29:25.764 --> 29:28.599
that the problem isn't here,
it's there!

29:28.684 --> 29:30.393
They've attacked us!

29:30.477 --> 29:33.688
Sabotaged us, abducted us,
murdered us.

29:34.731 --> 29:38.359
Maybe it's time we stop blaming us
and started worrying about them!

29:42.322 --> 29:44.490
We're not the only people
on this island,

29:44.575 --> 29:46.534
and we all know it!

29:53.750 --> 29:56.752
He did not do it.

30:45.427 --> 30:47.261
Look at this.

30:50.098 --> 30:52.642
I can't salvage a thing.

30:52.726 --> 30:55.144
Pontoons, the decking...

30:55.229 --> 30:57.313
Fire burnt up all the twine!

30:57.397 --> 30:58.981
Damn it!

31:01.151 --> 31:02.443
God...

31:12.287 --> 31:15.206
- I'm sorry, man.
- It's okay.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.208
No.

31:17.292 --> 31:19.752
Come here.

31:22.714 --> 31:26.342
Look...
We all have setbacks.

31:26.426 --> 31:28.719
I mean, God knows, man.

31:30.847 --> 31:32.682
That's just life.

31:33.517 --> 31:35.226
We'll start over, all right?

31:36.103 --> 31:37.812
You're gonna build another one?

31:37.896 --> 31:41.023
Yeah. A better one.

31:42.025 --> 31:43.734
Can I help?

31:43.819 --> 31:45.695
No doubt you can help.

31:45.779 --> 31:47.530
Come on!

32:34.953 --> 32:36.871
I was going to leave you!

32:39.124 --> 32:42.084
I was going to get away.

32:44.546 --> 32:47.548
But you made me change my mind.

32:49.676 --> 32:53.054
You made me think
that you still loved me.

37:33.919 --> 37:36.337
What was that for?

37:39.424 --> 37:42.009
Everyone gets a new life
on this island.

37:46.473 --> 37:49.308
I'd like to start now.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.159
Got yourself an opponent?

38:09.329 --> 38:11.705
Hurley owes me $83,000.

38:12.332 --> 38:15.209
I told him I'd give him
a chance to win it back.

38:19.047 --> 38:21.256
It's been a while
since you and I played.

38:22.425 --> 38:26.345
- I don't have $83,000.
- That's okay.

38:29.057 --> 38:31.642
- Where's your pop?
- Down at the beach, I think.

38:31.726 --> 38:34.979
I'm not allowed to leave
the caves after dark.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.233
Do you have a dad?

38:39.317 --> 38:41.151
Everyone's got a dad.

38:41.236 --> 38:42.820
Is he cool?

38:45.657 --> 38:47.616
No.

38:47.701 --> 38:49.576
No, he's not.

38:55.959 --> 38:58.711
- Yes!
- Good for you.

39:01.297 --> 39:03.257
Hey, you mind
if I ask you something?

39:03.341 --> 39:04.842
Sure.

39:06.928 --> 39:09.388
Why did you burn the raft?

39:20.400 --> 39:22.776
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna tell.

39:23.778 --> 39:26.030
You must have had
a really good reason.

39:31.911 --> 39:34.246
I don't want to move anymore.

39:36.124 --> 39:38.667
I've been moving places
my whole life.

39:43.131 --> 39:45.132
I like it here.

39:51.556 --> 39:53.932
I like it here too.

40:17.082 --> 40:19.124
Boat.

40:31.262 --> 40:32.262
Hey.

42:03.605 --> 42:05.856
Son of a bitch.
