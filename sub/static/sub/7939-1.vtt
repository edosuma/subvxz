00:35.035 --> 00:36.536
John?

00:41.041 --> 00:42.542
John!

00:46.546 --> 00:48.048
John!

01:07.067 --> 01:08.568
Johnny?

01:13.573 --> 01:15.575
Johnny, I'm coming in.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.078
- Ahh!
- Oh! Oh! Oh!

01:18.078 --> 01:21.581
- Oh, shit!
- Ahh! Ahh! Ohh! Whoa! Whoa!

01:21.581 --> 01:22.582
What? What?

01:23.083 --> 01:25.585
What? What the fuck?
I didn't see nothing.

01:25.585 --> 01:28.088
Jamie. Jamie, what-- Stop.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.590
Jamie, what are you doing?
What's going on?

01:30.590 --> 01:32.092
God, I'm sorry.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.593
Oh, man.

01:35.095 --> 01:38.098
I was-- I have jock itch, okay?
I was scratching my jock itch.

01:38.098 --> 01:41.101
You scared the hell out of me.
I didn't see anything, okay?

01:41.101 --> 01:42.602
You can't just come in.
You have to call.

01:43.103 --> 01:46.606
- I did call you! I called.
- What are you doing here?

01:46.606 --> 01:48.608
I'm getting married.
Tim and I are getting married.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.611
I'm engaged.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.623
I knew it.

02:04.124 --> 02:07.127
I knew it. I could tell from the sound
of your voice on the messages.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.627
I knew it. Shit.

02:11.631 --> 02:15.635
John, it's been seven years.

02:15.635 --> 02:18.138
I don't know what to tell you.
It still stings.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.141
And it's still a surprise.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.652
Listen.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.655
We're going to this party
tomorrow night.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.658
Tim and I are going.
Just listen.

02:38.658 --> 02:41.661
It's a great party.
Very cool people.

02:41.661 --> 02:44.164
People who would
stimulate you intellectually,

02:44.664 --> 02:49.169
and I, you know-- I hear really,
really kinda great chicks.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.671
I'm not going to a party.
Yeah, you are.

02:51.671 --> 02:54.174
You're coming.
You gotta get out of the house.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.176
Just let me do my thing.
I'll find my own way.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.178
I'll find someone
or I won't,

02:58.178 --> 03:00.680
and I'll be a great uncle to your kids.
Stop it.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.682
You're going to
take a shower,

03:03.183 --> 03:05.685
and you're going to put some
pants on that are clean...

03:05.685 --> 03:07.687
and those nice shoes.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.689
And then you and Tim
will introduce me:

03:09.689 --> 03:12.192
"Hey, this is the guy
that I dumped--

03:12.192 --> 03:13.693
"who's my ex-husband--

03:13.693 --> 03:15.695
but you'll love him!"

03:15.695 --> 03:17.697
You know how pathetic
that sounds?

03:17.697 --> 03:19.699
This is the perfect opportunity.
You're coming.

03:19.699 --> 03:23.703
- I want you to come.
- I'm not going to a party.

03:30.293 --> 03:31.794
Hey.
Hey.

03:31.794 --> 03:33.296
Hey, John.
How's that going?

03:33.296 --> 03:36.299
Good.
Good.

03:36.299 --> 03:38.801
It's just, that, you know,

03:38.801 --> 03:41.304
I could stare at a fire
for hours, you know?

03:42.805 --> 03:44.307
It's like TV.

03:47.310 --> 03:48.811
What?
This is--

03:48.811 --> 03:52.315
I came. I got dressed up.
I know you did. I know.

03:52.315 --> 03:57.320
John, drink that.
It's Red Bull and vodka.

03:57.320 --> 04:00.323
Drink it. Get lit.

04:00.323 --> 04:02.325
Ladies find you attractive.
Come on.

04:02.325 --> 04:04.827
All right, all right.
I'm not messing around. I'm serious.

04:04.827 --> 04:06.329
You want me to get insane?
Yeah.

04:06.829 --> 04:07.830
In the membrane.

04:07.830 --> 04:11.834
John, put it
inside your body.

04:11.834 --> 04:14.337
Tip it. Tip it. Tip it.

04:14.837 --> 04:16.339
Let's go.
Ahh.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.341
Giddyap. Come on, Big John.
Go, Johnny.

04:19.341 --> 04:21.344
Come on.
Lot of pretty girls here.

04:21.344 --> 04:22.845
Look at her. Oh, she's--

04:23.346 --> 04:25.348
No, you can't follow me too.

04:25.348 --> 04:26.849
Just watch and learn.

04:29.852 --> 04:31.854
They were $39,
and I'm like, "See those?"

04:32.355 --> 04:33.856
And he's like,
"They're perfect." Hey.

04:33.856 --> 04:35.858
Hi.
Are you waiting for the bathroom?

04:35.858 --> 04:39.362
Uh, no. Go ahead.
No, no.

04:39.362 --> 04:42.865
I was just asking.
I don't have to-- I don't have to go.

04:43.366 --> 04:44.867
Oh, well, it's right there.

04:47.370 --> 04:49.872
Anyway, um, so--

04:50.873 --> 04:52.875
Where did you get those?

04:52.875 --> 04:54.377
Ooh, ooh.

04:54.377 --> 04:55.878
Sorry.

04:57.880 --> 05:00.383
I think the screws
came out.

05:01.384 --> 05:03.886
Anyway--
You're just gonna hold that?

05:06.389 --> 05:11.394
Well, um, we're kind of, like,
having a conversation here, so-- Oh.

05:11.894 --> 05:13.396
Oh. I'm--

05:13.896 --> 05:16.399
I'm gonna have some
conversations too here, eventually.

05:19.902 --> 05:21.904
Hey, can I have
a vodka Red Bull?

05:25.908 --> 05:27.410
Hey.
Hey.

05:28.911 --> 05:32.415
- Do I know you?
- No, I was just being stupid.

05:33.416 --> 05:34.917
You seemed friendly.
Hey--

05:34.917 --> 05:38.421
Uh, red, please. Thanks.

05:38.921 --> 05:41.424
Red Bull?
You having Red Bull? Uh, wine.

05:41.924 --> 05:43.426
Oh.

05:45.428 --> 05:48.431
Thank you.
So-- Mmm, no.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.433
No.

05:51.934 --> 05:53.436
Thanks.

05:56.439 --> 05:59.442
I'm not an architect.
I'm not a deejay.

05:59.442 --> 06:04.947
I'm not a... marketing executive.
Listen. Marketing--

06:04.947 --> 06:08.451
You gotta be yourself and be
vulnerable and be honest...

06:08.451 --> 06:12.955
and just get out there and
talk to somebody who's like--

06:12.955 --> 06:14.957
Who should I talk to? you know,
seems like a normal girl.

06:14.957 --> 06:18.461
Name one person. Look at the woman
on the couch. She's totally cool.

06:18.461 --> 06:19.962
Okay, her? Done.
I'll go do it. Okay.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.468
Hi. Is anyone sitting here?

06:25.968 --> 06:27.470
Uh, no, go ahead.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.972
Ahh!

06:30.473 --> 06:31.474
Hi. I'm John.

06:31.974 --> 06:34.477
I'm Ashley.
Nice to meet you, Ashley.

06:34.477 --> 06:35.978
Thank you.

06:36.979 --> 06:38.481
Are you having a good time?

06:39.482 --> 06:41.984
Not really.

06:41.984 --> 06:44.487
Me, either. Uh...

06:45.988 --> 06:49.492
Can-- Listen.
I know we just met.

06:50.493 --> 06:51.994
Can I be honest with you?

06:51.994 --> 06:54.997
I just want to level
with somebody, okay?

06:56.999 --> 06:59.502
Sure.

06:59.502 --> 07:04.006
I am in a tailspin.

07:05.007 --> 07:06.509
And I'm lonely.

07:07.009 --> 07:09.512
I'm depressed,

07:09.512 --> 07:13.516
and I'm borderline desperate.

07:13.516 --> 07:17.520
But... I don't know.
I just-- I know myself.

07:18.020 --> 07:20.022
I know that
I'm a really fun person.

07:20.523 --> 07:23.526
I'm not a lonely person
or a depressed person.

07:23.526 --> 07:25.528
I have-- I don't know.

07:25.528 --> 07:30.032
I just feel like if I could find
the right person to be with me--

07:31.534 --> 07:34.537
I have so much to give,
you know. I have all these gifts.

07:34.537 --> 07:38.040
I'm like--
I'm a blast, you know?

07:39.542 --> 07:42.545
I'm sorry.
I have to make a phone call.

07:43.546 --> 07:45.548
Okay. That's--

07:49.886 --> 07:52.388
Okay. Plan B.

07:54.891 --> 07:56.893
You need to get more drunk.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.921
- Nice penis.
- Ohh!

08:26.422 --> 08:28.424
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
No.

08:28.424 --> 08:31.427
- Go ahead, finish up.
- No, no, no.

08:31.928 --> 08:34.931
Why does this keep happening to me?
It's the second time this week.

08:35.431 --> 08:36.933
Really?
Yeah.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.934
The other one was my wife.

08:40.436 --> 08:45.441
My ex-wife. She's getting remarried,
but I'm fine with it, so--

08:45.441 --> 08:49.445
Yeah, I overheard your-- your
conversation on the couch up there.

08:49.445 --> 08:51.948
Ohh. Did you?
Yes.

08:51.948 --> 08:53.950
- That was horrible.
- No, it wasn't.

08:53.950 --> 08:58.955
I thought it was
really raw and honest.

09:00.957 --> 09:02.959
You mean that?
Yeah.

09:02.959 --> 09:05.461
- You really mean it?
- I did.

09:05.461 --> 09:10.466
'Cause, um,
I've had a lot of weird conversations tonight,

09:10.967 --> 09:12.969
and if you really mean that,
I think I'm gonna start crying.

09:12.969 --> 09:14.971
I mean it. I mean it.
I mean it.

09:16.472 --> 09:18.975
Why am I even--
I can't talk to you.

09:18.975 --> 09:21.477
What am I doing?
I'm just gonna mess this up.

09:21.477 --> 09:24.480
'Cause you're a really
hot girl and I'm just--

09:25.982 --> 09:28.985
I'm sorry.
You're not messing it up.

09:30.486 --> 09:33.489
Are you flirting with me?

09:35.491 --> 09:39.996
This is insane.
I'm like Shrek.

09:39.996 --> 09:41.497
What-- What are you doing--
I-- I didn't say that.

09:41.998 --> 09:44.000
What are you doing here
in the forest with Shrek?

09:44.500 --> 09:46.002
I was gonna pee
in the bushes--

09:46.002 --> 09:48.504
Really?
and you took my spot.

09:50.506 --> 09:53.009
Oh! Do you hear that song?

09:53.009 --> 09:54.510
What?

09:55.011 --> 09:56.512
Wait. I'm sorry.
Wait right here.

09:56.512 --> 10:00.016
It's the greatest song ever recorded,
and I'm gonna go enjoy it,

10:00.516 --> 10:02.518
and I'm gonna come back
and talk to you.

10:02.518 --> 10:04.520
Don't worry.

10:05.521 --> 10:08.524
Dance song! Come on, move out!

10:08.524 --> 10:12.028
Come on, it's good stuff.
Dance party!

10:12.028 --> 10:14.530
Dance party! Look out!

10:14.530 --> 10:16.532
Clear the dance zone!

10:17.533 --> 10:19.035
# # Don't # #

10:19.035 --> 10:21.537
# # Don't you want me # #
Come on!

10:21.537 --> 10:23.539
# # You know I can't believe you
when I say that # #

10:24.040 --> 10:29.045
# # I love Red Bull and vodka!
# # Don't, don't you want me

10:29.045 --> 10:33.549
# # Don't believe it
when you say that you don't need me # #

10:35.051 --> 10:37.553
# # You think you've
changed your mind # #

10:38.054 --> 10:41.557
# # You'd better change it back
or we will both be sorry # #

10:41.557 --> 10:46.062
# # Don't you want me, baby #
# Come on!

10:46.062 --> 10:50.066
# # Don't you want me, ohh # #

10:50.066 --> 10:52.068
# # Don't you want me, baby # #

10:52.568 --> 10:56.572
Come on, you guys!
It's a party!

10:59.075 --> 11:03.079
I guess I'm the only one
who loves a good song.

11:06.082 --> 11:09.585
# # I was working as a waitress
in a cocktail bar # #

11:09.585 --> 11:11.087
Thank you!

11:11.087 --> 11:13.589
# # That much is true # #
Yeah, baby.

11:13.589 --> 11:18.594
# # But even then I knew I'd
find a much better place # #

11:18.594 --> 11:21.097
# # Either with or without you # #

11:21.097 --> 11:23.099
Thank you.
Get up, come on!

11:23.099 --> 11:26.602
# # Don't you want me # #
Come on!

11:26.602 --> 11:29.105
# # You know I can't believe it
when you say # #

11:29.105 --> 11:31.107
What are you guys doing?
Come on!

11:33.109 --> 11:34.610
# # You think you've
changed your mind # #

11:34.610 --> 11:39.115
# # You'd better change it back
or we will both be sorry # #

11:39.115 --> 11:41.617
# # Don't you want me, baby # #

11:42.118 --> 11:44.620
Yes! Yes! Keep going.

11:44.620 --> 11:47.123
# # Don't you want me now # #

11:50.126 --> 11:52.128
How did you do that?

11:52.128 --> 11:53.629
That was crazy.
Ohh.

11:54.130 --> 11:56.132
Do you do exercises
or something?

11:58.134 --> 12:00.136
You're amazing.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.138
You're an angel.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.640
You're a sex angel.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.142
Oh, my God.

12:10.646 --> 12:12.148
You want to sleep over?

12:31.167 --> 12:33.169
Mm-hmm.

12:40.342 --> 12:41.844
Hello?

12:41.844 --> 12:43.345
Hi, Molly.

12:43.846 --> 12:45.347
Hey, it's John.

12:46.849 --> 12:48.350
Who?

12:48.350 --> 12:50.853
John?
From last night?

12:52.855 --> 12:54.857
John?

12:54.857 --> 12:57.359
Just kidding, John. Hi.

12:57.359 --> 12:59.361
Oh, okay.
I'm glad you called.

12:59.361 --> 13:01.363
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm glad I called too.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.866
That was really fun
last night.

13:03.866 --> 13:07.369
Mm-hmm.
And thanks for the note and, um--

13:07.369 --> 13:10.372
Hey, I was wondering if you
wanted to hang out tonight.

13:11.874 --> 13:13.876
Sure.
Yeah?

13:15.377 --> 13:16.879
Great. You want to come
over here then or--

13:17.379 --> 13:20.883
Look, I have to run, but I'll
come over after work, okay?

13:21.383 --> 13:22.885
Okay, sounds good.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.887
Bye.
Bye.

14:34.456 --> 14:35.958
Hey.
Hi.

14:35.958 --> 14:38.460
How are you?
Good, good.

14:38.460 --> 14:42.965
There's a whole custom-prepared plate.
I want yours.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.469
You're a very good cook.

14:48.971 --> 14:52.975
I just decided
to give it my all.

14:54.476 --> 14:57.479
Which is not
the cool-guy thing to do.

14:57.479 --> 14:59.481
I'm not into that anyway.

15:02.985 --> 15:06.488
Okay? Okay.
I'll take your word for it.

15:08.991 --> 15:12.494
I know I'm not supposed to say this,
but I really like you.

15:12.494 --> 15:15.998
Is it crazy for me to say,
like, I want it to work out?

15:16.498 --> 15:21.503
Is that too much?
Am I supposed to be cooler than that?

15:21.503 --> 15:23.505
Oh.

15:25.007 --> 15:27.509
My life is really
complicated right now.

15:30.512 --> 15:32.514
But I'm definitely interested.

15:42.024 --> 15:45.027
Hey. Where you going?

15:45.027 --> 15:47.529
Hey, hey.

15:47.529 --> 15:50.532
I-- I just have to--
I have to go.

15:51.033 --> 15:53.035
Wait. Why do you have
to leave so late?

15:53.035 --> 15:56.038
I just have to-- I have to--
Just call me tomorrow, okay?

15:56.538 --> 16:01.043
Molly, wait. Give me one second, please.
Are you married?

16:01.043 --> 16:04.046
Is that where you're going?
No, I'm not married.

16:04.046 --> 16:06.048
What is it?
Are you a secret agent?

16:06.048 --> 16:07.549
Just trust me.
What is going on?

16:08.050 --> 16:09.551
Call me tomorrow, okay?

17:32.334 --> 17:33.836
Oh, my God.

18:19.882 --> 18:21.383
- Hi.
- Oh, hi. Hey, hi.

18:21.383 --> 18:24.386
Sorry.
Uh, what am I doing?

18:24.386 --> 18:26.889
It's okay.
Hi. Uh--

18:26.889 --> 18:28.891
Can I help you?

18:28.891 --> 18:31.393
Uh, I'm sorry. Is this--

18:31.393 --> 18:33.395
I think I have the wrong
address actually.

18:33.395 --> 18:35.898
What address are you looking for?
Um...

18:37.399 --> 18:39.401
Is this--
Does Molly live here?

18:39.401 --> 18:41.403
Yeah. Can I ask who is asking?

18:41.403 --> 18:43.906
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm John.
I'm a friend of hers.

18:43.906 --> 18:45.908
I was in the neighborhood,
and I was, like,

18:45.908 --> 18:47.409
"I think that's
Molly's house,"

18:47.910 --> 18:50.412
but I didn't want to ring
the doorbell if it wasn't.

18:50.412 --> 18:54.917
Um, no, it is. You can definitely ring
the doorbell. That's more conventional.

18:54.917 --> 18:57.920
But, uh-- Yeah, I know.
I was just-- Whatever. I was shy. I was--

18:57.920 --> 19:02.424
But I am a friend of hers,
and I'm sorry. Oh. I'm Cyrus.

19:02.424 --> 19:04.426
Cyrus. Yeah.

19:06.428 --> 19:08.931
- Her son.
- Her son. Yeah, I know. Yeah.

19:08.931 --> 19:12.935
Um, yeah, anyway--

19:15.938 --> 19:17.940
So how long you known Molly?

19:19.441 --> 19:21.944
Uh, actually,
just a couple days.

19:22.444 --> 19:23.946
Wow. Just a couple days.

19:24.947 --> 19:26.949
Yeah, we just met, so--

19:29.451 --> 19:30.953
But you could feel it
already, huh?

19:30.953 --> 19:32.955
Like there's something
really special happening?

19:35.457 --> 19:38.961
Y-Yeah.

19:42.464 --> 19:44.466
Can I--
How old are you?

19:44.466 --> 19:46.468
I'm almost 22.

19:46.468 --> 19:48.470
Oh, okay. All right.

19:48.470 --> 19:49.972
I'm 21.

19:50.472 --> 19:54.476
So you-- you guys have always lived together?
You didn't--

19:54.476 --> 19:56.979
You're not, like, in
from school or whatever?

19:56.979 --> 19:59.481
No, I took my G.E.D.
when I was 16,

19:59.481 --> 20:01.984
and then, um,
you know--

20:01.984 --> 20:04.486
M-Molly and I are like best
friends so-- Oh, okay.

20:04.486 --> 20:06.488
And my dad's not really in the picture.
Uh-huh.

20:06.488 --> 20:09.491
She kinda homeschooled me
and raised me by herself.

20:11.493 --> 20:14.496
And since then,
I've sort of been focusing on my music career.

20:14.496 --> 20:18.000
Mm-hmm. Oh, that's--
So that's you? That's--

20:18.500 --> 20:20.502
That's my studio.
That's my work space, yes. Yeah, I saw that.

20:21.003 --> 20:24.006
You got a couple synths there.
Oh, more than a couple.

20:24.006 --> 20:26.508
I think I have something
around seven pieces.

20:27.009 --> 20:29.011
Yeah. Vintage
and some new stuff.

20:31.013 --> 20:33.181
Would you like to hear
some of my-- my work?

20:33.181 --> 20:35.183
Yeah, why not? I mean, yeah.

20:36.184 --> 20:39.187
Great. Great.
Okay, great. Great.

20:39.187 --> 20:43.191
Um, it's-it's untitled right now,
and it's an unfinished piece.

20:51.199 --> 20:54.202
Slow

21:14.222 --> 21:17.225
Sounds like Steve Miller.
You know that one Steve Miller song?

21:17.225 --> 21:18.727
No, it doesn't.

21:59.267 --> 22:00.769
Hi.

22:03.271 --> 22:04.773
Hey.

22:07.275 --> 22:10.779
It's good.

22:11.279 --> 22:12.781
Ohh!

22:14.282 --> 22:16.284
- Hi. Sorry.

22:16.284 --> 22:20.288
I was in the neighborhood,
and Cyrus came out and let me in. I'm sorry.

22:21.289 --> 22:23.792
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:23.792 --> 22:25.794
Hi.
Hi. Hey.

22:25.794 --> 22:27.796
Hey. Hey.

22:29.798 --> 22:32.801
- Anyway--
- So, John, are you gonna stay for dinner?

22:34.803 --> 22:38.306
Uh, uh--

22:38.306 --> 22:39.808
Yes, dinner.

22:44.780 --> 22:48.283
There's literally, like, 15 peppers.
- I know. Well--

22:48.283 --> 22:50.786
I'm just not gonna be able to
eat it if they're on the side.

22:51.286 --> 22:53.789
I know.

22:54.289 --> 22:56.792
You asked for them
without peppers?

22:56.792 --> 23:00.295
I did, but they never-- I'm not
gonna use this place anymore.

23:00.295 --> 23:03.799
- There's a big red one right there.
- That's okay.

23:03.799 --> 23:05.801
So, John,
I have to apologize to you.

23:06.802 --> 23:08.804
What?

23:08.804 --> 23:10.806
You came in
and I-I sat you down,

23:10.806 --> 23:13.308
and I just started blabbing
all about my life.

23:13.308 --> 23:16.311
I get overly excited sometimes,
and I apologize.

23:16.812 --> 23:18.313
I honestly am curious
to hear about you...

23:18.814 --> 23:22.818
and, you know,
just want to-- want to hear more about your life.

23:24.820 --> 23:28.824
Well, uh, let's see.
I'm-I'm an editor.

23:29.324 --> 23:31.827
I do freelance
editing work. Um--

23:33.829 --> 23:37.332
I like to go to the movies.
I've got a pretty good DVD collection.

23:37.833 --> 23:40.335
I mean, what--

23:40.335 --> 23:41.837
what else do you
want to know?

23:42.337 --> 23:43.839
I don't want to know
what you do.

23:43.839 --> 23:46.341
I want to know what you are.
Who you are.

23:46.341 --> 23:49.344
That's more what I'm--
what I'm interested in.

23:52.347 --> 23:55.851
Are we really gonna-- You want me to?
Okay. I'm, uh-- I'm--

23:57.352 --> 23:59.855
I'm divorced.

23:59.855 --> 24:01.857
I got divorced, like,
seven years ago.

24:01.857 --> 24:06.361
And it wasn't my idea.

24:06.361 --> 24:08.864
It was--
You know, I got left.

24:09.364 --> 24:13.869
Uh, I was kind of digging
myself into a hole with my life,

24:13.869 --> 24:17.873
and my wife at the time
was not happy with it.

24:17.873 --> 24:21.376
Told me so. Said to work it out.
I didn't work it out.

24:21.877 --> 24:23.879
I ran away from her
emotionally...

24:23.879 --> 24:26.381
and made a huge mistake...

24:26.381 --> 24:31.386
and have been in kind of a dark,
existential place, to tell you the truth.

24:31.386 --> 24:34.890
And then I met your mom
at a party,

24:34.890 --> 24:36.892
and, I don't know.

24:36.892 --> 24:41.897
Seems like things are looking up
for the first time in a long time.

24:42.898 --> 24:45.901
That's--
Wow.

24:46.401 --> 24:48.403
You asked. That's where I'm at.
Wow. Wow.

24:49.404 --> 24:51.406
I like your style, John.

24:51.406 --> 24:54.910
To John-- Our new friend.

24:55.911 --> 24:58.413
You seem like a good man.

24:58.413 --> 25:00.916
That was a lot
of information.

25:00.916 --> 25:03.418
So, uh, are you gonna
stay the night?

25:03.418 --> 25:07.422
Maybe we should ask
your mom. I don't know.

25:08.924 --> 25:12.427
Um, I think that's
between me and John.

25:13.428 --> 25:14.930
Fair enough.

25:14.930 --> 25:17.933
I was just messing around. It's not,
uh-- It's none of my business.

25:18.433 --> 25:22.938
It's valid. It's valid. If I was in your position,
I'd probably be a little--

25:22.938 --> 25:25.941
I mean-- Molly?

25:25.941 --> 25:27.943
Seriously, don't fuck my mom.

25:27.943 --> 25:31.446
I'm just kidding.
I'm just joking around. Sorry. No.

25:31.446 --> 25:33.448
Cy!

25:33.448 --> 25:36.451
I know. I--
I'm sorry. Uh--

25:37.452 --> 25:39.454
that's my attempt
at humor, John.

25:39.454 --> 25:40.956
Okay.
That's, uh, just--

25:40.956 --> 25:43.458
Enough said.

25:47.462 --> 25:49.464
We did have sex.

25:49.464 --> 25:53.468
I mean, if you want to be adults about it,
we did. That's--

25:53.969 --> 25:55.470
I'm sorry if that's
weird or whatever,

25:55.470 --> 25:57.973
but I'm not gonna sit here
and pretend like we didn't.

25:58.473 --> 26:00.976
We met at a party and-- That's
not appropriate to talk about here.

26:00.976 --> 26:05.480
Okay. I mean, I don't want to disrespect
you by treating you like a child or whatever.

26:05.981 --> 26:08.984
You seem like you want to be
treated like an adult, and--

26:08.984 --> 26:12.988
That's just it. That's--
That happened, so--

26:13.989 --> 26:15.490
That's--

26:16.992 --> 26:19.494
I accept that information.

26:42.384 --> 26:43.885
- Hey, John?
- Hey.

26:44.886 --> 26:48.890
I just want to say I thought
it was really great...

26:49.391 --> 26:52.394
what you did at dinner,
opening up to me like that.

26:52.394 --> 26:56.898
And I know it was weird,
but I thought it was great.

26:57.399 --> 26:58.900
Thanks.

26:58.900 --> 27:00.902
And it's great to finally
have a new dad.

27:06.908 --> 27:09.411
You got to get used
to my weird sense of humor.

27:09.411 --> 27:14.916
But I really thought that was-- that
was a great thing that you did.

27:14.916 --> 27:17.919
Actually, your mom's
in the shower.

27:30.932 --> 27:36.438
# # The king
falls off the throne # #

27:36.438 --> 27:41.443
# # The king falls off
of the throne # #

27:54.956 --> 27:57.459
Hi.
Hi.

27:57.459 --> 27:59.461
- Night, John.
- Good night, Cyrus.

27:59.461 --> 28:03.465
- Night, Molly.
- Good night, Cyrus.

28:03.965 --> 28:05.467
Good shower?

28:06.468 --> 28:08.470
Yeah.
Yeah?

28:08.470 --> 28:13.475
You know, there's something that I've
been thinking about in the shower. And I--

28:13.475 --> 28:19.981
I really appreciated what you were expressing
in the kitchen and throughout dinner.

28:19.981 --> 28:24.486
And I've-- I--

28:24.486 --> 28:26.988
I feel a little, um--

28:26.988 --> 28:29.991
I guess a little embarrassed
and just a little, uh--

28:29.991 --> 28:31.493
It's not even that.

28:31.493 --> 28:34.496
I just want to say I appreciate
how open you were.

28:34.496 --> 28:35.997
I love that about you,

28:35.997 --> 28:41.503
and I'm sorry that I wasn't
as open about my boy.

28:41.503 --> 28:43.004
No, that's fine.

28:43.004 --> 28:45.507
It's your--

28:45.507 --> 28:48.009
Yeah, I know.
your prerogative not to say that stuff.

28:48.009 --> 28:52.514
It's private, we just met,
and I was fine with it. I mean--

28:53.515 --> 28:55.016
He's a great kid too.
He is.

28:55.517 --> 28:57.018
I'm glad you appreciate that.

28:57.519 --> 28:59.020
I was going to leave,

28:59.020 --> 29:01.523
and he was, like,
"No, come in, come in."

29:03.024 --> 29:05.026
I'm happy to hear that.

29:05.527 --> 29:08.029
I didn't--
I'm happy to hear that.

29:09.030 --> 29:11.032
And that's the thing.
He's so--

29:13.034 --> 29:16.037
He's very mature,
as you can see, in a lot of ways,

29:16.037 --> 29:17.539
and he really pushes me.

29:17.539 --> 29:22.544
But in other ways he's just--
he's not come into himself yet.

29:23.044 --> 29:26.047
And-And it's coming,
and it's coming from a very deep place.

29:28.049 --> 29:31.553
This could be a--
This is a very sudden--

29:31.553 --> 29:34.055
You are very sudden.

29:34.055 --> 29:38.059
And I haven't had a man over--

29:38.059 --> 29:40.562
to stay overnight--

29:40.562 --> 29:43.565
since Cyrus, uh, was born.

29:44.566 --> 29:47.569
So it's a new thing.

29:47.569 --> 29:51.072
Well-- But to tell you the truth,
you didn't have me over.

29:51.072 --> 29:53.074
I-- I stalked you over--

29:53.575 --> 29:55.076
Yeah, you gave it a little--

29:55.076 --> 29:58.079
I get seized sometimes,
so it's okay you're here.

29:58.079 --> 30:03.585
Molly, everything is a gift,
at this point, to me.

30:03.585 --> 30:05.086
Just getting to hang out.

30:05.587 --> 30:08.089
Like every moment,
from moment to moment.

30:10.091 --> 30:12.594
Thanks for talking to me
about my--

30:13.595 --> 30:16.097
I just feel a little--
No, I know.

30:28.109 --> 30:30.111
N-N-N--

30:30.111 --> 30:31.613
No, we leave the door open.

30:31.613 --> 30:33.615
Oh. I was just going to
take my pants off.

30:33.615 --> 30:36.618
We just-- We-- We just
always leave the door open.

30:39.120 --> 30:41.122
Um, okay.

30:52.634 --> 30:54.135
Hey.

30:54.135 --> 30:58.139
Good morning.
You guys are early risers, huh?

30:58.139 --> 31:00.141
Yep. How'd you sleep?
Good.

31:00.141 --> 31:01.643
Good. How'd you sleep?
Very well.

31:02.143 --> 31:04.145
Good.
Nice.

31:05.647 --> 31:07.148
So what's-- What's, uh--

31:07.148 --> 31:10.151
What's going on?
What's the plan?

31:10.151 --> 31:12.153
What are you guys doing?

31:12.153 --> 31:15.657
Um, we go to Elysian Park every
morning and eat a little breakfast...

31:15.657 --> 31:17.659
and take some photos
for a few hours.

31:17.659 --> 31:21.162
Yeah. Cyrus composes
to images of nature.

31:21.162 --> 31:24.666
Sounds cool.
I am supposed to work.

31:28.670 --> 31:31.172
Should I blow it off?

31:36.678 --> 31:38.680
I'll just get it over with.

31:38.680 --> 31:42.183
I'll get in there. Get it done.
Then I have less to do next week, so--

31:43.184 --> 31:44.686
Anyway, all right.

31:49.190 --> 31:51.192
Here you go, Mom.
Did you guys see my shoes?

31:51.192 --> 31:54.195
- No.
- They were right here.

31:55.196 --> 31:57.198
Weird.

31:58.199 --> 32:00.702
Okay.

32:00.702 --> 32:06.174
Yeah. I can't believe
how deep into it I am already.

32:06.174 --> 32:08.176
That's amazing.
I'm so happy for you.

32:08.176 --> 32:10.178
Thank you.
I really am.

32:10.178 --> 32:11.679
It's amazing.
Is it that obvious?

32:11.679 --> 32:14.682
Am I-- Am I glowing?
You actually are.

32:15.183 --> 32:18.186
You look good.
Just, you know, slow down.

32:18.186 --> 32:20.688
Let's just be here now.
Don't worry, I'm not--

32:20.688 --> 32:23.691
I know. I just don't want you,
you know, to obsess on this.

32:23.691 --> 32:25.693
I was a little needy out of the gate.
Yes.

32:26.194 --> 32:29.197
I'll admit that.
But it's settling in nicely now.

32:30.698 --> 32:34.202
And other than one little
weird blip this morning,

32:34.202 --> 32:36.704
I am not concerned
about anything.

32:36.704 --> 32:38.706
What? What is it?

32:38.706 --> 32:43.211
Um, when I woke up this morning,
my shoes were missing from their house.

32:43.211 --> 32:45.713
Your white Adidas?
Yeah.

32:46.214 --> 32:48.716
Your favorite shoes.
Oh, my God.

32:48.716 --> 32:50.718
Well, then somebody
did you a favor.

32:50.718 --> 32:53.221
Whatever.
It-It'll be fine.

33:01.229 --> 33:05.733
- John?
- I definitely left my shoes in their living room.

33:05.733 --> 33:09.237
You know what I mean?
I wore shoes into the house. Shoes-- John?

33:09.237 --> 33:12.740
Can we not have this conversation
at 1:30 in the morning?

33:12.740 --> 33:15.743
Oh, I'm sorry.
I had no idea what time it was.

33:15.743 --> 33:19.247
But the more I think
about the shoes,

33:19.247 --> 33:21.749
now it's like every look the kid
gave me seems really weird.

33:21.749 --> 33:23.751
- Like he was being friendly but--
- Yeah.

33:23.751 --> 33:26.254
Will you please do me a favor
and meet them...

33:26.254 --> 33:29.257
and tell me whether I'm the one
who's paranoid and crazy?

33:29.257 --> 33:30.758
Sure.
Good night, John.

33:30.758 --> 33:32.260
Fine. I will, okay?

33:32.260 --> 33:36.264
It's got to be totally casual
and like it was an accident.

33:44.105 --> 33:45.606
No.

33:45.606 --> 33:48.609
Higher so that it takes longer and I can catch it.

33:48.609 --> 33:50.111
Okay.

33:53.114 --> 33:54.615
Yes.

33:55.116 --> 33:59.620
Mmm. I love the ripples.
This looks incredible.

33:59.620 --> 34:02.123
There they are. There they are.
Come on. Come on.

34:02.123 --> 34:04.625
It ripples out almost across the whole thing.
Molly?

34:04.625 --> 34:06.627
Hey.
Hey.

34:07.128 --> 34:08.629
Oh, my gosh, Cyrus.
How's it going? John.

34:08.629 --> 34:10.130
How you doing?
Hi.

34:10.630 --> 34:12.132
I'm Cyrus.
So nice to meet you.

34:12.632 --> 34:14.635
I was just saying,
"I wonder if they're hanging out in the park."

34:14.635 --> 34:16.637
- I'm Molly. We've met.
- This is Jamie.

34:16.637 --> 34:18.639
- We go jogging here all the time.
- You do?

34:18.639 --> 34:22.143
Yeah. That's so weird,
because we're here literally every day.

34:24.145 --> 34:25.646
Yeah, you said that,
but I didn't make the--

34:26.147 --> 34:28.149
I guess, I don't know.
I guess the jogging track--

34:28.649 --> 34:31.652
We took a little bit of a side diversion this time.
Yeah.

34:32.152 --> 34:35.156
What are you doing?

34:35.156 --> 34:37.658
Your hair-- The light is hitting
your hair in this great way.

34:37.658 --> 34:41.161
It's like a crippled tree
reaching for heaven.

34:42.163 --> 34:44.165
John, would you do me
a huge favor?

34:44.165 --> 34:45.666
Yeah, what?

34:45.666 --> 34:48.168
Would you mind
getting into the tree?

34:51.172 --> 34:53.674
Try one where you get in
the tree just like a jaguar.

34:53.674 --> 34:57.678
Like a jaguar?
Yeah, just climb up the tree like a jaguar.

34:58.679 --> 35:00.681
Oh, that's great.
That's great.

35:01.182 --> 35:03.184
You're a natural.

35:03.184 --> 35:05.686
Now do one where you just
scream as loud as you can.

35:05.686 --> 35:09.190
No, that's not screaming.
That's moaning.

35:09.190 --> 35:11.692
You're bossy, Cyrus.

35:12.193 --> 35:15.196
You look incredible right now.
I'm really trying to get the most of this.

35:15.196 --> 35:17.198
All right.
Now scream as loud as you can.

35:47.728 --> 35:50.231
What did you think?
Did you like them?

35:50.231 --> 35:53.234
Yes! I think
they're really sweet...

35:53.234 --> 35:55.736
and, uh, kind--

35:55.736 --> 35:57.738
And the wrestling wasn't weird?
And quirky.

35:57.738 --> 36:01.742
No, that was weird. But, you know,
in a good way. I don't know.

36:02.243 --> 36:05.746
I don't think it was,
like, "strange" weird.

36:05.746 --> 36:08.749
I mean, it wasn't "bad" weird.
You know?

36:08.749 --> 36:10.251
They're really cool.
I like them.

36:10.251 --> 36:12.253
They're cool, right?
They're fun.

36:12.253 --> 36:13.754
They're fun.
They're great.

36:13.754 --> 36:17.258
And I don't think
they stole your shoes.

36:17.258 --> 36:20.761
Thank you for coming out here.
I appreciate it.

36:20.761 --> 36:23.764
Don't worry. All right,
I'll see you at the office in a second.

36:23.764 --> 36:25.766
Relax, okay?
All right. Okay.

36:25.766 --> 36:26.767
Okay.

36:27.268 --> 36:29.270
You're the best, Jamie.

36:36.944 --> 36:38.946
Okay. That one.

36:39.947 --> 36:41.449
That one's great.

36:41.949 --> 36:43.951
No, let's skip that one.

36:46.954 --> 36:48.956
Oh, that's perfect.

36:48.956 --> 36:50.458
That's the perfect one.

36:54.462 --> 36:55.963
Hello?

36:56.964 --> 36:59.967
Hi.

36:59.967 --> 37:02.970
No, no, no. I don't need anything.
Thanks. I'll see you in a minute.

37:02.970 --> 37:04.472
Okay.

37:06.474 --> 37:08.476
Who's that?

37:08.476 --> 37:10.978
John.
He's gonna come by.

37:10.978 --> 37:12.480
Cool.
Yeah.

37:12.480 --> 37:15.983
I was-- I-- I was going to tell you and then--

37:15.983 --> 37:19.487
- I don't know. We never talked about it.
- Okay.

37:19.487 --> 37:21.989
Anyway,
he's coming over.

37:21.989 --> 37:24.492
That was a lot.
You could have just said "John's coming over."

37:24.992 --> 37:26.994
I know.
I guess I could have.

37:27.495 --> 37:31.499
- I feel weird.
- You don't have to explain yourself.

37:31.499 --> 37:33.501
I think it's nice that
John's coming to see you.

37:33.501 --> 37:36.504
I think it's lovely,

37:36.504 --> 37:39.006
but I still feel--

37:39.006 --> 37:42.510
I feel really--
I feel really weird.

37:42.510 --> 37:44.011
You feel weird?
Mm-hmm.

37:44.011 --> 37:45.513
Why do you feel weird?

37:46.013 --> 37:48.015
Are you okay with all of this?
Yes.

37:48.516 --> 37:52.019
If I was 10, maybe I'd feel weird,
but I am a grown-up,

37:52.520 --> 37:55.523
and you deserve somebody
who can love you--

37:56.023 --> 37:59.527
in a way that I can't love you,
and-- Okay. Okay.

37:59.527 --> 38:02.029
I think it's great.
Okay.

38:03.030 --> 38:04.532
I'm the weirdo.

38:05.032 --> 38:07.034
Hey. How you doing?

38:07.034 --> 38:08.035
Hey, Cyrus.
Hey, John.

38:08.536 --> 38:09.537
Hi.
Hi.

38:11.038 --> 38:12.540
Welcome.

38:29.056 --> 38:31.559
Well, well, well.

38:31.559 --> 38:33.561
You've closed the door.

38:45.072 --> 38:47.074
Ohh!
What? What's going on?

38:47.074 --> 38:50.578
No, no, no! It's okay. Stay!
Stay in here. Stay here!

38:57.585 --> 38:59.086
Is everything okay?

39:19.106 --> 39:20.608
Oh.

39:56.477 --> 39:57.978
Hi, John.

40:00.481 --> 40:01.982
Oh, hey.

40:03.484 --> 40:05.486
I was just looking
for your mom.

40:06.487 --> 40:07.988
I think she's asleep.

40:08.989 --> 40:10.491
Oh, okay.

40:12.993 --> 40:14.495
Come here.

40:19.500 --> 40:21.001
Come here.

40:23.003 --> 40:24.004
You hungry?

40:27.508 --> 40:29.009
I heard you scream,

40:31.512 --> 40:34.014
and your mom didn't tell me
what was going on so--

40:39.520 --> 40:41.522
Night terrors.

40:41.522 --> 40:44.024
I used to get them a lot
when I was younger,

40:44.024 --> 40:47.027
and I just recently
started getting them again.

40:48.028 --> 40:50.030
I'm sorry.

40:50.030 --> 40:53.033
I'll get through it.
Sounds terrible.

40:53.033 --> 40:55.035
Um, I'm glad you're up,

40:55.035 --> 40:57.037
because I've been wanting
to talk to you man-to-man.

41:02.543 --> 41:05.045
No. I'm-- I'm all right.

41:06.547 --> 41:11.051
I didn't want to say anything,
'cause Molly asked me not to, but...

41:13.053 --> 41:18.058
I think-- I think you might be
coming on a tad too strong.

41:20.561 --> 41:22.062
Okay.

41:23.063 --> 41:24.565
She said that?

41:24.565 --> 41:28.569
She didn't say it
in those exact words but--

41:30.070 --> 41:31.572
Wow. I mean--

41:33.574 --> 41:36.577
I don't want to get into it, but
those were not the signals...

41:37.077 --> 41:39.079
I was getting at all tonight.

41:41.081 --> 41:42.583
In the past,

41:43.584 --> 41:48.589
when she's losing interest,

41:49.590 --> 41:53.594
she tends to
overcompensate sexually.

41:56.597 --> 42:00.601
I just think that if you
pulled back 10% to 20%,

42:00.601 --> 42:03.604
emotionally speaking,
you'd do a lot better for yourself.

42:11.111 --> 42:13.113
Wow.

42:13.113 --> 42:14.615
Okay.

42:15.616 --> 42:17.618
Okay, I'm gonna
go to sleep.

42:20.621 --> 42:23.123
Night, John.
Good night.

42:58.158 --> 43:00.160
Did you see John this morning?

43:01.662 --> 43:03.163
He actually left
last night.

43:04.665 --> 43:06.166
Last night?

43:07.668 --> 43:09.169
Come take a seat, Mom.

43:14.174 --> 43:15.676
You look so serious.

43:19.680 --> 43:21.682
I talked to John last night.

43:23.684 --> 43:25.185
Uh-huh.

43:36.196 --> 43:37.698
What?

43:38.198 --> 43:39.700
He...

43:41.201 --> 43:44.705
feels that things
are moving really fast,

43:44.705 --> 43:46.707
and...

43:46.707 --> 43:51.211
I think he wants to just
slow down a little bit.

43:52.212 --> 43:53.714
He said that?

43:54.715 --> 43:56.216
Read the note.

43:58.218 --> 44:01.221
I mean,
it's just so not like him.

44:07.227 --> 44:09.229
Are you saying
that I'm making this up?

44:09.229 --> 44:11.732
No, I'm just--
I'm confused.

44:11.732 --> 44:14.735
You're confused?
What do you mean you're confused?

44:14.735 --> 44:17.738
I'm just trying to tell you the truth,
and you're, like, attacking me?

44:17.738 --> 44:19.740
- I'm just trying to help!
- Wait!

44:19.740 --> 44:21.742
Where are you going?

45:06.562 --> 45:08.064
Hello?

45:08.064 --> 45:09.565
Hey.

45:09.565 --> 45:11.567
Hey.

45:12.068 --> 45:15.071
Can you come over?
Something's going on with Cyrus.

45:16.072 --> 45:18.074
Is everything okay?

45:18.574 --> 45:21.077
He's been gone all day.
He's missing.

45:21.077 --> 45:23.079
Yeah. Yeah.
I'm on my way.

45:23.079 --> 45:24.580
Thanks.
Okay, bye.

45:36.842 --> 45:37.843
Hey.

45:40.346 --> 45:41.847
You okay?
Mmm.

45:41.847 --> 45:43.849
Thanks so much for coming.

45:50.856 --> 45:52.858
Are you hungry?
You want something to eat?

45:55.361 --> 45:58.364
Mm-mmm.
No?

45:58.364 --> 46:01.367
I could order something
or pick something up or--

46:04.370 --> 46:06.372
Mm-mmm.
You should eat something.

46:06.372 --> 46:08.374
Mmm, I'm not hungry.

46:15.381 --> 46:16.882
Hey. Hi.

46:17.383 --> 46:18.884
Hi.

46:19.385 --> 46:21.387
Hello.

46:21.387 --> 46:23.889
Hi. Come here.

46:23.889 --> 46:25.891
What happened?

46:25.891 --> 46:29.895
Molly, why don't you,
uh-- why don't you sit down for a sec, okay?

46:29.895 --> 46:31.397
Sit down for a second.

46:31.397 --> 46:33.399
Um--

46:33.399 --> 46:35.901
You guys want to
talk alone or--

46:36.402 --> 46:38.904
No, this concerns you.
You should stay, John.

46:38.904 --> 46:40.406
Are you sure?
Yeah.

46:40.906 --> 46:42.408
Okay.

46:42.408 --> 46:46.412
I don't want to make this emotional.
I've decided to move out.

46:48.414 --> 46:51.917
I'm an adult now, and I think
it's time for us to move on.

46:52.918 --> 46:55.421
I-I--
It's pretty sudden though.

46:55.421 --> 46:56.922
- I rented a room.
- You rented a room?

46:56.922 --> 47:00.926
I found some musicians on Craigslist,
and I'm gonna rent a room in their house.

47:00.926 --> 47:02.928
And it's gonna be
better for both of us.

47:02.928 --> 47:04.930
And besides,
you have John now,

47:04.930 --> 47:07.933
and you guys need some space
for your relationship to flourish.

47:08.934 --> 47:10.436
It's for the best.

47:11.437 --> 47:12.438
Yeah.

47:13.439 --> 47:17.443
I think that maybe--
This is so sudden.

47:17.443 --> 47:23.449
- Maybe you're feeling some anger or--
- I'm not angry.

47:23.449 --> 47:25.951
Maybe you should just
take it slowly, step-by-step.

47:25.951 --> 47:27.453
You guys are so serious.

47:28.454 --> 47:30.956
It's not a big deal.

47:34.460 --> 47:37.963
Well, I need to go,
'cause I'm gonna go paint my room tonight.

47:37.963 --> 47:41.467
Then I'm gonna come back with a truck
tomorrow and get the rest of my things.

47:41.467 --> 47:43.469
Will you pack them up
for me, Mom?

47:43.469 --> 47:45.471
Uh--

47:45.471 --> 47:48.974
Please. It'll be easier.
Just give me a hug.

47:56.982 --> 47:58.484
I love you.

47:59.985 --> 48:04.490
It's okay. We'll take some time off
and let the dust settle a little bit,

48:04.490 --> 48:07.993
and we'll all get together
for dinner or something, okay?

48:10.996 --> 48:12.998
John, really nice
spending time with you.

48:13.999 --> 48:15.000
Okay.

48:57.543 --> 49:02.047
It's gonna be good.
I'm excited about the new place.

49:04.049 --> 49:06.051
Tilt it sideways a little bit.

49:24.069 --> 49:26.071
Thanks, John.
Yeah.

49:30.576 --> 49:33.078
Will you thank Molly for packing
up all this stuff for me, please?

49:33.078 --> 49:37.082
Actually, she had to work,
so I did most of it.

49:38.584 --> 49:40.085
Oh.

49:44.089 --> 49:45.090
Thanks.

49:46.091 --> 49:47.593
No problem.

49:49.094 --> 49:50.095
Okay.

49:55.100 --> 49:56.602
See you.

50:07.613 --> 50:08.747
That's great.
There you are.

50:09.248 --> 50:11.250
You are not gonna believe this.
He did it.

50:11.250 --> 50:12.751
He stole my shoes.

50:13.252 --> 50:16.255
This means my whole friendship
with the guy is based on bullshit.

50:16.255 --> 50:19.758
All right, let me just finish-- The first night
I was there, he was messing with me.

50:19.758 --> 50:22.261
That means there hasn't been
an honest moment yet.

50:22.261 --> 50:23.762
Jamie!
I get it. I'm sorry.

50:23.762 --> 50:28.267
I have to do this. Then I have to go
to the flower shop for my wedding.

50:28.267 --> 50:30.769
Can we just talk about this later, please? Yes.

50:30.769 --> 50:32.771
I will wait.

50:32.771 --> 50:34.773
It was the act of taking the
shoes that was the big deal...

50:34.773 --> 50:38.277
and the fact that he's been lying
the whole time I've known him.

50:38.277 --> 50:41.780
Bringing me in, acting like, "Hey, yeah,
come on in. No problem.

50:41.780 --> 50:43.782
Any friend of my mom's
a friend of mine."

50:43.782 --> 50:45.784
The whole time just
to get me to trust him,

50:45.784 --> 50:47.786
so he can turn around
and stab me in the back.

50:48.287 --> 50:49.288
Oh, my God.
It's interesting.

50:49.288 --> 50:50.789
Don't you guys see?

50:50.789 --> 50:54.793
By saying he's leaving because of me,
he makes me the bad guy.

50:54.793 --> 50:58.297
Right?
It's like he lit the fuse and ran away.

50:58.297 --> 51:00.799
Will you go look over at those flowers?
I'm sorry, you guys.

51:00.799 --> 51:02.801
That's okay.
These are nice ranunculus.

51:03.302 --> 51:05.804
Keep naming flowers, John.
Whatever you'd like.

51:05.804 --> 51:07.306
It's just a wedding, honey.
Don't sweat it.

51:07.306 --> 51:09.808
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'll leave you guys alone.

51:09.808 --> 51:12.311
I just have to--
I feel like--

51:12.311 --> 51:13.812
It's all right.

51:13.812 --> 51:16.815
She's sitting there, lonely,
in this house, miserable,

51:16.815 --> 51:19.818
which is exactly
what he wants her to feel.

51:42.841 --> 51:44.843
Are you all right?

51:44.843 --> 51:46.345
No.

51:46.845 --> 51:48.347
Come here.

51:54.353 --> 51:55.854
It's gonna be okay.

51:55.854 --> 51:57.356
No, it's not.

52:03.362 --> 52:07.366
I know it seems just weird that it was so fast,
but it really is gonna be all right.

52:07.366 --> 52:09.368
No, it's not okay!
Okay.

52:16.875 --> 52:19.878
Let's just go to sleep.
Yeah.

52:33.892 --> 52:37.896
Listen, I know you're tired
of me saying this.

52:37.896 --> 52:39.398
So don't say it.

52:40.399 --> 52:43.402
And it's upsetting to hear.
It is.

52:43.402 --> 52:45.904
But it's not
gonna be all right.

52:46.405 --> 52:48.407
It's gonna be terrible.

52:52.411 --> 52:54.413
That's true.

52:54.413 --> 52:56.415
Things are really
not gonna be okay.

52:57.916 --> 52:59.918
That makes me feel better.

53:06.925 --> 53:08.427
Just be honest with me.

53:08.427 --> 53:10.429
Yeah. Yeah.

53:12.431 --> 53:15.934
Thank you.
Thank you.

53:17.936 --> 53:18.937
You're welcome.

53:23.442 --> 53:26.445
I like you.
I want to be with you.

53:29.448 --> 53:31.950
I love being with you.

53:43.962 --> 53:47.466
I want to wake up
in the morning at your house...

53:47.466 --> 53:49.968
instead of waking up
at my house going,

53:49.968 --> 53:51.970
"I gotta get over to her house.
I miss her."

53:56.475 --> 53:57.976
What do you think?

54:03.482 --> 54:04.983
Did you just ask to move in?

54:05.484 --> 54:07.486
Yes. I did.

54:11.490 --> 54:15.994
So, hold on. Hold on. But...

54:15.994 --> 54:19.498
I don't know which way the wind
is blowing with Cyrus.

54:19.998 --> 54:22.000
And I don't know how he's feeling.
Yeah, of course.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.002
I don't think that he knows
how he's feeling and--

54:24.002 --> 54:27.005
Let's take it day by day...

54:28.006 --> 54:30.509
for as long as we can go.

54:39.518 --> 54:41.520
Okay.

54:41.520 --> 54:43.522
Yeah, let's do this.

55:09.881 --> 55:12.384
Where are you going?
Where are you taking me?

55:12.384 --> 55:13.885
Right there.
Hmm?

55:13.885 --> 55:16.388
I'm taking you right there.

55:16.388 --> 55:19.391
Oh, my goodness.
What are you doing?

55:23.395 --> 55:25.897
I want to get fucked.
You're naughty.

55:26.398 --> 55:28.900
Mm-hmm.

55:28.900 --> 55:29.901
Hey, guys.

55:29.901 --> 55:32.904
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

55:32.904 --> 55:33.905
What the--

55:34.906 --> 55:35.907
Hey, man.

55:35.907 --> 55:36.908
Cy--

55:37.409 --> 55:39.911
Sorry for interrupting you.
Good to see you.

55:40.412 --> 55:41.913
Hi.
Yeah.

55:43.915 --> 55:46.918
Uh, were you planning on
coming over?

55:46.918 --> 55:48.420
We didn't get a message.

55:48.420 --> 55:50.422
Just came home for a bit.

55:56.928 --> 56:00.432
That was, uh, bad timing
there, huh?

56:03.435 --> 56:04.936
Can I have a hug?

56:07.939 --> 56:08.940
Yeah.

56:08.940 --> 56:10.942
Come here.

56:14.946 --> 56:17.449
I went through something
really tough tonight.

56:19.451 --> 56:21.453
Oh, baby.

56:21.453 --> 56:22.954
What happened?

57:13.505 --> 57:15.507
He wants to come back home.

57:17.509 --> 57:18.510
Okay.

57:19.511 --> 57:21.513
He's been having
panic attacks.

57:22.013 --> 57:24.015
Oh, no.

57:25.517 --> 57:26.852
Hmm.

57:30.355 --> 57:33.358
The weird thing is,
it was his decision, you know?

57:33.358 --> 57:35.360
He is an adult and--
I mean--

57:35.360 --> 57:36.862
But these
are panic attacks,

57:36.862 --> 57:39.364
and that doesn't have anything
to do with being an adult or not.

57:39.364 --> 57:40.866
Yeah.
An adult, that's--

57:40.866 --> 57:42.868
No. I know, I know.

57:44.369 --> 57:45.370
Yep.

57:46.872 --> 57:47.873
Ohh.

57:50.876 --> 57:52.878
Do you mind if
I go talk to him?

58:07.893 --> 58:08.894
Hey.

58:12.898 --> 58:14.900
You can relax.
It's just me.

58:16.401 --> 58:17.903
I'm sorry?

58:48.934 --> 58:50.936
We should talk.

59:00.445 --> 59:03.949
What the fuck are you doing
with all your shit in my room?

59:03.949 --> 59:08.954
Oh, you're going to stop
bullshitting now? This is good.

59:08.954 --> 59:11.957
You know,
I was gonna come back.

59:12.457 --> 59:14.960
I was gonna apologize
to you both.

59:14.960 --> 59:18.463
But after this shit you just pulled?
You just fucked yourself, John.

59:18.964 --> 59:20.966
What are you gonna do?
You gonna hide my belt now?

59:20.966 --> 59:23.969
You gonna light a bag of shit
on fire in front of my door?

59:23.969 --> 59:25.470
You are out of your league.

59:25.470 --> 59:27.472
I will do whatever it takes.
Listen to yourself.

59:27.973 --> 59:29.975
What do you think your mom would
say if she could hear you right now?

59:30.475 --> 59:31.977
Who's going to
tell her? You?

59:32.477 --> 59:33.979
Who do you think
she's gonna believe?

59:33.979 --> 59:37.482
Her son, who needs her now more than
ever after his battle with panic and anxiety,

59:37.983 --> 59:40.986
or this new guy who clearly
wants her kid out of the way?

59:41.486 --> 59:43.488
You listen to me,
you little weirdo.

59:43.488 --> 59:46.992
If you want to mess with me,
I'm gonna mess with you right back.

59:47.993 --> 59:48.994
Oh, buddy.

59:53.198 --> 59:54.699
Everything okay?

59:54.699 --> 59:56.201
Yeah.

59:56.201 --> 59:57.702
I was feeling
a little panicky.

59:58.203 --> 01:00:02.707
I was talking to John about how happy
I am to be around you guys right now.

01:00:04.709 --> 01:00:06.711
The thought of going back
to that house...

01:00:07.712 --> 01:00:10.215
makes me all...

01:00:10.215 --> 01:00:11.716
fluttery and nauseous.

01:00:11.716 --> 01:00:15.220
You don't have to
go back there, sweetie.

01:00:18.223 --> 01:00:20.725
You know, um,

01:00:22.727 --> 01:00:25.730
I've never told anybody
this before, but, uh,

01:00:27.232 --> 01:00:29.234
I used to get
anxiety attacks.

01:00:29.234 --> 01:00:31.236
You did?
Yeah.

01:00:31.236 --> 01:00:33.238
So I know how scary
they can be.

01:00:33.238 --> 01:00:36.741
Wow. Did you have a good
family to help you get through it?

01:00:36.741 --> 01:00:38.243
You know, I didn't.

01:00:38.243 --> 01:00:40.245
I couldn't imagine
going through this alone.

01:00:40.245 --> 01:00:41.746
Yeah, but I did.

01:00:41.746 --> 01:00:45.250
It was terrifying.
I didn't know what was going on.

01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:47.252
They didn't even call them
anxiety attacks back then.

01:00:47.252 --> 01:00:49.754
I just thought
I was going crazy.

01:00:49.754 --> 01:00:51.756
I almost left college.

01:00:51.756 --> 01:00:54.259
But I decided to tough it out.

01:00:54.259 --> 01:00:57.262
And that decision
made me who I am.

01:00:59.264 --> 01:01:01.266
This could be that
moment in your life.

01:01:01.266 --> 01:01:03.768
Where you go from
being a boy to being a man,

01:01:03.768 --> 01:01:07.272
and you say, "You know what?
You're not gonna beat me."

01:01:10.275 --> 01:01:14.279
- Do you guys not want me to come home?
- No.

01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:19.284
'Cause if so, just say so,
and I'll totally find another place.

01:01:19.284 --> 01:01:22.787
I'll figure something out.
That's not what he's saying, Cyrus.

01:01:23.288 --> 01:01:26.791
No. Not at all.
I'm not saying that.

01:01:27.292 --> 01:01:28.793
Look.

01:01:28.793 --> 01:01:30.795
You know what
the right decision is.

01:01:33.298 --> 01:01:36.801
You know in your heart
what the right thing to do is.

01:01:38.803 --> 01:01:40.305
When I looked in my heart,

01:01:41.806 --> 01:01:43.308
I decided that it--

01:01:44.809 --> 01:01:46.311
I decided that
coming back here...

01:01:46.311 --> 01:01:49.314
was not defeat,

01:01:49.314 --> 01:01:52.317
but, in a way,
like a weird victory.

01:01:52.817 --> 01:01:55.320
And if it's okay
with you, John,

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:57.822
I'd really like
to come back home.

01:02:07.332 --> 01:02:08.333
Okay.

01:02:08.833 --> 01:02:10.835
Thank you, John.

01:02:10.835 --> 01:02:13.338
You're an amazingly
selfless guy.

01:02:14.339 --> 01:02:16.341
Thanks, buddy.

01:02:27.352 --> 01:02:28.853
It's halftime.
Are you hungry, hon?

01:02:28.853 --> 01:02:31.356
I am so fucked.

01:02:31.356 --> 01:02:32.857
Honey?

01:02:38.363 --> 01:02:40.865
I think it's time you just had a
conversation with these people--

01:02:40.865 --> 01:02:42.367
You know,
all three of you.

01:02:42.367 --> 01:02:45.370
I can't.
I can't do that. Why?

01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:46.871
Because if I do,

01:02:47.372 --> 01:02:49.874
it's just gonna be between me and him,
and she's gonna pick him, and that's it.

01:02:49.874 --> 01:02:52.377
I lose. I can't do that.

01:02:52.377 --> 01:02:55.880
But you tell me
she's supersensitive,

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:59.884
and if you really love her,
then have the conversation with her.

01:02:59.884 --> 01:03:03.888
It doesn't, you know--
Just let the truth come out.

01:03:10.895 --> 01:03:12.397
Good night.
Okay.

01:03:12.397 --> 01:03:14.899
I love you.
I love you.

01:03:16.401 --> 01:03:17.902
Good night.
Good night.

01:03:18.403 --> 01:03:20.405
Oh, um,

01:03:20.405 --> 01:03:23.908
I forgot to ask.
John, do you have an extra tie I could borrow?

01:03:23.908 --> 01:03:25.910
A what?

01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:29.414
A tie. I want to try and look
nice for the wedding tomorrow.

01:03:30.915 --> 01:03:32.917
Uh, yeah. I think I do.

01:03:33.418 --> 01:03:38.423
I've got a bunch of ties,
so I'll find one for you, if you need it.

01:03:38.423 --> 01:03:40.425
Thanks.
All right, good night.

01:03:48.933 --> 01:03:54.439
Um, wow. I didn't know that Cyrus
was coming with to the wedding.

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:56.941
Oh.

01:03:57.942 --> 01:04:00.945
Yeah. Yeah. I-I--

01:04:00.945 --> 01:04:02.947
I-I know it's a lot,

01:04:04.949 --> 01:04:07.452
but he's going through
a lot, so--

01:04:08.953 --> 01:04:09.954
Yeah.
Okay?

01:04:09.954 --> 01:04:10.955
Okay.

01:04:12.457 --> 01:04:14.459
Um,

01:04:14.459 --> 01:04:16.461
I don't know
how to put this.

01:04:19.964 --> 01:04:21.466
Uh,

01:04:22.467 --> 01:04:24.969
do you ever feel like...

01:04:24.969 --> 01:04:27.972
Cyrus is not being...

01:04:30.975 --> 01:04:33.978
a hundred percent genuine?

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:36.981
How do you mean?
I don't know.

01:04:37.482 --> 01:04:40.985
I know he's going through a lot,
and I'm not trying to deny that.

01:04:44.489 --> 01:04:46.491
Um,

01:04:46.491 --> 01:04:47.992
I mean, like--

01:04:47.992 --> 01:04:49.994
I'm sorry.
Spit it out.

01:04:49.994 --> 01:04:50.995
No. Uh--
You're just--

01:04:50.995 --> 01:04:54.499
He's behaving in a way
that I think...

01:04:54.999 --> 01:04:57.502
is--

01:04:57.502 --> 01:04:59.003
um--

01:05:00.505 --> 01:05:03.007
All right,
I don't know how else to--

01:05:03.007 --> 01:05:06.010
I wasn't gonna tell you about this, but, whatever,
I'll show you.

01:05:14.519 --> 01:05:17.522
My shoes were
in Cyrus's closet.

01:05:20.024 --> 01:05:21.526
Hidden.

01:05:25.530 --> 01:05:30.034
So, what--
what does that really mean?

01:05:31.536 --> 01:05:33.037
I don't know.

01:05:33.037 --> 01:05:35.039
You know,
sometimes I think--

01:05:36.541 --> 01:05:40.044
and I want to put
this exactly right--

01:05:41.045 --> 01:05:43.548
he might be...

01:05:43.548 --> 01:05:45.049
acting...

01:05:47.552 --> 01:05:49.554
out...

01:05:49.554 --> 01:05:51.556
with this behavior.

01:05:54.058 --> 01:05:56.060
How long have you
felt like this?

01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:58.563
Do I feel that way?
I don't know.

01:05:58.563 --> 01:06:03.568
I'm just unearthing things in
my own head right now. I just--

01:06:03.568 --> 01:06:06.571
You know what?
This is too important.

01:06:06.571 --> 01:06:08.072
We should have Cyrus come in here.
No.

01:06:08.072 --> 01:06:10.074
Let's talk about this.
No, no, no.

01:06:10.074 --> 01:06:13.578
Trust me.
It will really put him on the spot.

01:06:13.578 --> 01:06:16.080
He's having panic attacks.

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:18.583
We'll have a great time at the wedding.
Are you sure?

01:06:18.583 --> 01:06:21.586
Yeah. Yeah.

01:07:01.626 --> 01:07:03.127
Cyrus.

01:07:03.127 --> 01:07:04.629
Shh, shh, shh.

01:07:04.629 --> 01:07:06.130
It's okay.
Shh, shh, shh.

01:07:06.130 --> 01:07:07.632
Cyrus. Shh.
It's me.

01:07:07.632 --> 01:07:09.133
Are you all right?
Am I all right?

01:07:09.634 --> 01:07:11.135
Yeah.
What are you doing in my room?

01:07:11.636 --> 01:07:13.137
I want to talk to you.

01:07:14.639 --> 01:07:18.142
Listen, I know why you want to
come to the wedding tomorrow.

01:07:20.144 --> 01:07:24.649
This wedding is really,
really important to me.

01:07:24.649 --> 01:07:29.654
And my ex-wife's feelings are really,
really important to me.

01:07:31.155 --> 01:07:33.157
And I know we've been messing
around with each other,

01:07:33.658 --> 01:07:37.662
and it would be a great time for you to
mess things up for me and your mom.

01:07:37.662 --> 01:07:39.163
I agree.

01:07:39.163 --> 01:07:41.165
But here's the thing.

01:07:41.666 --> 01:07:45.169
Do you know what it feels like
to be knocked unconscious?

01:07:45.169 --> 01:07:49.674
Because if I sense for one second
that anything weird is going on,

01:07:49.674 --> 01:07:54.178
or you're even thinking of pulling some shit,
I will knock you out.

01:07:55.179 --> 01:07:56.681
Do you understand?

01:07:59.684 --> 01:08:01.185
Yeah.
Good.

01:08:01.185 --> 01:08:03.688
Then let's have a great time
at the wedding tomorrow, okay?

01:08:36.687 --> 01:08:38.689
How you doing, Roger?
Good. Good. You look great.

01:08:38.689 --> 01:08:39.689
Thank you.

01:08:48.698 --> 01:08:50.201
Um,

01:08:50.201 --> 01:08:52.703
you know this is a big day
for John, right?

01:08:53.703 --> 01:08:54.705
Yes.

01:08:58.209 --> 01:08:59.710
Okay.

01:09:06.716 --> 01:09:09.220
I choose you to be mine.

01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:11.721
To live with you
and laugh with you.

01:09:12.723 --> 01:09:17.228
To stand by your side
and sleep in your arms.

01:09:17.728 --> 01:09:23.734
To be joy to your heart
and food for your soul.

01:09:23.734 --> 01:09:26.737
To bring out the best
in you always.

01:09:28.238 --> 01:09:33.743
Jamie and Tim,
please join hands and repeat after me.

01:09:34.745 --> 01:09:37.747
I, Jamie, take you, Tim--

01:09:37.747 --> 01:09:39.750
I, Jamie,
take you, Tim--

01:09:40.251 --> 01:09:42.752
to be my lawfully
wedded husband--

01:09:42.752 --> 01:09:44.755
to be
my lawfully wedded husband--

01:09:44.755 --> 01:09:46.756
to have and to hold--

01:09:46.756 --> 01:09:48.759
to have
and to hold--

01:09:48.759 --> 01:09:50.761
to love and to cherish--

01:09:50.761 --> 01:09:52.763
to love
and to cherish--

01:10:15.786 --> 01:10:18.789
John. John.
Yeah.

01:11:16.013 --> 01:11:18.015
Oh, I'm in here.

01:11:23.521 --> 01:11:24.522
What?

01:11:28.526 --> 01:11:31.529
Cyrus, are you drunk?

01:11:32.029 --> 01:11:33.531
What happened?
How did you get drunk so fast?

01:11:34.031 --> 01:11:37.535
I saw the way you
looked at her, John.

01:11:37.535 --> 01:11:41.539
You can't marry her.
You'll never, ever marry her ever.

01:11:41.539 --> 01:11:43.541
Listen to me.

01:11:43.541 --> 01:11:45.543
Before you embarrass yourself,

01:11:45.543 --> 01:11:48.546
let me call you a cab and send you home,
'cause you're drunk.

01:11:48.546 --> 01:11:50.047
Hey, hey, hey.
Stay away from my mother.

01:11:50.548 --> 01:11:52.550
What'd I warn you
about last night?

01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:55.553
Don't you do this to me!
She's all I have! Don't marry her!

01:11:55.553 --> 01:11:58.055
Knock it off!
You're not gonna take her away from me!

01:11:58.055 --> 01:12:00.558
Calm the fuck down!
You'll never fucking punch me, John!

01:12:01.058 --> 01:12:03.060
- Get your shit together!
- Just leave us the fuck alone!

01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:05.563
Fuck you!
She's all I fucking have!

01:12:05.563 --> 01:12:08.566
Go, John!
Go! Just go away!

01:12:08.566 --> 01:12:11.068
- Just go away and leave us the fuck alone!
- Put some water on your face!

01:12:11.569 --> 01:12:12.570
Stop it!
Leave us alone!

01:12:13.070 --> 01:12:14.071
You stop it!
Stop it!

01:12:14.572 --> 01:12:16.073
What are you doing? Hey!

01:12:16.073 --> 01:12:18.075
Hey! Hey!
I'm not doing anything!

01:12:18.075 --> 01:12:19.577
What, are you
out of your mind?

01:12:19.577 --> 01:12:21.579
You stop it!
He hit me.

01:12:21.579 --> 01:12:24.081
- Did you hit him?
- He attacked me in the bathroom!

01:12:24.081 --> 01:12:26.083
Did you hit him?

01:12:26.083 --> 01:12:28.085
He hit me.
John!

01:12:42.099 --> 01:12:44.101
Open your eyes, Molly.

01:13:34.318 --> 01:13:35.820
He went crazy in the bathroom.

01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:37.822
Well, I didn't see
that part.

01:13:37.822 --> 01:13:40.825
I didn't even know that happened.
So, what did you think?

01:13:40.825 --> 01:13:43.327
Did you think that I suddenly-- I wasn't thinking.

01:13:43.828 --> 01:13:45.830
tackled Cyrus
and was beating him up?

01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:49.333
- How could you think that about me?
- I just reacted.

01:13:49.333 --> 01:13:52.837
I just saw my son
on the floor being hurt.

01:13:54.338 --> 01:13:57.341
From the moment
that I met you,

01:13:57.341 --> 01:14:02.346
as soon as your son became aware of it,
he made it his mission to split us up.

01:14:02.346 --> 01:14:05.349
Every step of the way,
every overture I made,

01:14:05.349 --> 01:14:09.854
every time I tried to be understanding and
reach out to him, he's shut me down.

01:14:09.854 --> 01:14:11.355
He hates me, Molly.

01:14:11.355 --> 01:14:13.858
- He hates me.
- He's having a really tough time.

01:14:13.858 --> 01:14:15.359
He's not having a tough time.

01:14:15.359 --> 01:14:16.861
Your son hates me.

01:14:18.362 --> 01:14:21.365
And I gotta say,
I fucking hate him too.

01:14:35.379 --> 01:14:37.381
Nothing here
between us that's...

01:14:40.384 --> 01:14:43.387
worth taking
another look at?

01:14:44.388 --> 01:14:45.890
You and I--

01:14:45.890 --> 01:14:48.392
We do have something.

01:14:50.394 --> 01:14:52.396
And I know how rare it is,

01:14:52.897 --> 01:14:54.899
because it's
been a long time...

01:14:55.399 --> 01:14:58.903
since I had anyone
close to someone like you.

01:15:00.905 --> 01:15:04.408
But I am not prepared...

01:15:04.408 --> 01:15:07.912
to get deeper into it and
hoping it's gonna work out,

01:15:07.912 --> 01:15:11.916
and then two years down the line
it's not gonna work out,

01:15:11.916 --> 01:15:14.418
and you guys have each other,

01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:18.923
and I'm alone again.

01:15:18.923 --> 01:15:23.427
I just think there's so much
here between us and--

01:15:26.931 --> 01:15:29.934
He's gonna not--
He's gonna wreck it.

01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:38.442
So that's it.

01:15:38.442 --> 01:15:39.944
I'm sorry.

01:16:20.484 --> 01:16:22.987
I've been thinking
about us, and...

01:16:24.989 --> 01:16:27.992
I feel like I've missed a few
things in our relationship.

01:16:27.992 --> 01:16:31.996
And I feel that
I've done you a disservice...

01:16:33.497 --> 01:16:36.000
with the way that I raised you,
in some aspects.

01:16:42.006 --> 01:16:43.507
I'm so proud of...

01:16:44.008 --> 01:16:46.010
who we are
and how close we are.

01:16:48.012 --> 01:16:49.513
I don't think
there's any reason...

01:16:49.513 --> 01:16:52.016
to feel negatively about that.

01:16:54.018 --> 01:16:56.520
The fact that you and I
have a hard time...

01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:58.522
letting another person...

01:16:59.523 --> 01:17:02.026
hang out with us is...

01:17:05.029 --> 01:17:07.031
unhealthy for us, I feel.

01:17:08.532 --> 01:17:11.035
I don't want you
to think that...

01:17:11.535 --> 01:17:17.041
I want you to be alone forever
or want you to be unhappy.

01:17:18.542 --> 01:17:23.047
I want you to find somebody
and be with him.

01:17:25.549 --> 01:17:30.554
But I know in my heart
that John is not that person.

01:17:34.558 --> 01:17:39.063
There are things that are
happening from all sides of this.

01:17:39.063 --> 01:17:41.065
I-I--

01:17:41.065 --> 01:17:44.068
I know what happened
with the shoes.

01:17:49.073 --> 01:17:52.576
Who cares? It's shoes.

01:17:52.576 --> 01:17:55.079
It's so stupid. It's shoes.
I don't care about shoes.

01:17:56.580 --> 01:18:02.586
But I care if
you're lying to me.

01:18:07.591 --> 01:18:12.096
I used to feel like you and I had
a special little thing, and now...

01:18:12.096 --> 01:18:14.598
I'm feeling like you...

01:18:15.599 --> 01:18:18.102
are letting me go away.

01:18:23.607 --> 01:18:25.609
No one will ever...

01:18:25.609 --> 01:18:27.611
ever take your place.

01:18:28.612 --> 01:18:30.114
Ever.

01:18:34.618 --> 01:18:36.620
Well, I'm happy he's gone.

01:18:44.628 --> 01:18:46.630
I'm not happy right now.

01:19:32.342 --> 01:19:33.343
What do you want?

01:19:35.846 --> 01:19:38.348
I want you to come back
and live with us.

01:19:40.350 --> 01:19:42.352
Are you
fucking kidding me?

01:19:43.353 --> 01:19:45.355
Come on,
just go home, Cyrus.

01:19:45.355 --> 01:19:47.357
It's not the same anymore!
Oh, it's not the same?

01:19:47.357 --> 01:19:48.859
No. She's depressed!
That's 'cause you fucked it up!

01:19:48.859 --> 01:19:51.361
She misses you, John!
I know you love her!

01:19:51.361 --> 01:19:52.863
Yeah, I know!

01:19:52.863 --> 01:19:55.365
We had a great thing,
and you fucked it up!

01:19:55.866 --> 01:19:59.870
Please, John. Just hear me out and then
you can make the decision for yourself.

01:20:00.871 --> 01:20:02.873
I'll move out.
I'll do whatever you want.

01:20:02.873 --> 01:20:05.375
Don't punish her
'cause I'm a fucked-up person.

01:20:05.375 --> 01:20:07.377
I-I-- It's--

01:20:07.377 --> 01:20:09.880
It's not her fault.
No, it's not her fault!

01:20:10.380 --> 01:20:12.883
It's not her fault!
It's your fault!

01:20:13.884 --> 01:20:17.888
So you just live with that,
you asshole!

01:20:17.888 --> 01:20:22.392
It's your fault that I'm back
in a shitty apartment all alone!

01:20:22.893 --> 01:20:25.896
You're a little fucking liar
and an asshole!

01:20:25.896 --> 01:20:27.397
So fuck you!

01:20:33.403 --> 01:20:34.905
Go away!

01:20:43.914 --> 01:20:45.415
Are you still out there?

01:21:20.951 --> 01:21:22.452
Move over.

01:21:40.470 --> 01:21:42.472
Let me ask you something.

01:21:44.474 --> 01:21:46.476
Were the panic attacks
real or fake?

01:21:48.979 --> 01:21:51.982
They were real at first,
and then...

01:21:53.483 --> 01:21:56.486
sometimes I would fake them
to get sympathy from Molly.

01:22:04.494 --> 01:22:06.496
I brought you something.

01:22:08.999 --> 01:22:11.001
It's mixed,
but it's not mastered.

01:22:11.001 --> 01:22:13.003
So it's not final.

01:22:17.507 --> 01:22:21.511
I think I might be a really fucked-up
and dysfunctional person, John.

01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:32.022
You did some
fucked-up stuff.

01:22:35.525 --> 01:22:37.527
But it's my fault too.

01:22:44.534 --> 01:22:47.037
How'd you get through
all these panic attacks?

01:22:52.542 --> 01:22:56.546
I'm sorry.
I never had panic attacks.

01:22:57.547 --> 01:23:00.050
I made that up
to try to get rid of you.

01:23:08.058 --> 01:23:10.060
It was war at that point.

01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:13.063
I was desperate.
I had to come up with something.

01:23:13.063 --> 01:23:15.065
You were boxing me out.

01:23:23.573 --> 01:23:25.075
You're good, John.

01:23:25.575 --> 01:23:28.078
Well, you're good.

01:23:33.583 --> 01:23:35.085
Would you mind--

01:23:38.088 --> 01:23:40.090
Would you mind
giving me a ride home?

01:23:42.092 --> 01:23:44.094
Okay. Is your mom home?

01:23:45.095 --> 01:23:47.097
No.

01:23:47.097 --> 01:23:48.598
All right. 'Cause--

01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:53.103
I don't know. I'm just--

01:23:53.103 --> 01:23:56.106
I'm really not ready
to talk to her yet.

01:24:08.785 --> 01:24:11.288
I'm just gonna drop you off
right here, if that's okay.

01:24:11.288 --> 01:24:12.789
Yeah.

01:24:19.296 --> 01:24:21.798
Thanks for the ride.
No problem.

01:24:49.326 --> 01:24:51.828
I have some of your stuff
in the garage that you left.

01:24:51.828 --> 01:24:53.830
I'll go grab it.

01:24:53.830 --> 01:24:56.833
Right now?
Yeah. I'll be right back.

01:26:16.112 --> 01:26:21.117
# # My love # #

01:26:21.117 --> 01:26:25.121
# # Please # #

01:26:25.121 --> 01:26:29.626
# # Realize we're okay # #

01:26:30.126 --> 01:26:35.131
# # Realize we're okay # #

01:26:37.634 --> 01:26:43.139
# # I can't wait
to sleep tonight # #

01:26:43.139 --> 01:26:48.144
# # Will you be there # #

01:26:48.144 --> 01:26:53.149
# # Will you be there # #

01:26:54.150 --> 01:26:59.155
# # My love # #

01:26:59.656 --> 01:27:04.661
# # Please

01:27:34.691 --> 01:27:36.693
# # I buried a bone # #

01:27:36.693 --> 01:27:41.197
# # And, darling
you don't know him # #

01:27:41.197 --> 01:27:44.701
# # Darling, you don't know him #
#

01:27:44.701 --> 01:27:47.203
# # Darling, you don't know # #

01:27:50.206 --> 01:27:56.212
# # And just where you are
might be the right place # #

01:27:56.212 --> 01:28:00.717
# # Might be that sweet space # #

01:28:00.717 --> 01:28:02.719
# # But you don't know # #

01:28:05.221 --> 01:28:10.727
# # Look me in the head
I got nothin' on my mind # #

01:28:13.730 --> 01:28:18.234
# # I've been waitin' for you
all this time # #

01:28:21.237 --> 01:28:27.243
# # And I seen a path
turn to an old road # #

01:28:27.243 --> 01:28:31.247
# # But the secret's too slow # #

01:28:31.247 --> 01:28:34.250
# # Or we're too fast # #

01:28:51.768 --> 01:28:56.773
# # Look me in the mouth
I got nothin' in my smile # #

01:28:59.776 --> 01:29:04.280
# # I've been waitin' for you
You're just my style # #

01:29:07.283 --> 01:29:12.789
# # Look me in the gut
I got fear for my own name # #

01:29:14.791 --> 01:29:17.794
# # I'd dig it up for you # #

01:29:19.295 --> 01:29:21.297
# # If you'd do the same # #

01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:26.302
# # I buried a bone # #

01:29:26.302 --> 01:29:30.306
# # And, darling
you don't know him # #

01:29:30.807 --> 01:29:34.310
# # Darling, you don't know him # #

01:29:34.811 --> 01:29:37.313
# # Darling, you don't know # #
