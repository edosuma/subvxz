WEBVTT

01:34.929 --> 01:36.597
I'm afraid there was no other choice.

01:36.681 --> 01:38.516
The solar cells had to be replaced,

01:38.599 --> 01:40.768
and it simply can't be done in the air.

01:40.851 --> 01:43.688
But don't worry.
It's all modular these days,

01:43.771 --> 01:45.898
and we'll be off the ground
in less than ten minutes.

01:45.982 --> 01:47.858
Any time is too long.

02:11.590 --> 02:12.883
See? All done.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.247
- What?
- I'm in Gotham.

02:43.331 --> 02:44.915
<i>Have you located the target?</i>

02:44.999 --> 02:46.292
Not yet.

02:46.375 --> 02:49.045
It's not easy when you're always
looking over your shoulder.

02:49.128 --> 02:50.379
You're letting your fear...

02:50.463 --> 02:51.797
Make you too cautious.

02:51.881 --> 02:53.090
<i>Me? You're the one</i>

02:53.174 --> 02:55.259
who spent the last three months
in the air

02:55.343 --> 02:58.721
afraid to land anywhere
because she might find you.

02:58.804 --> 03:00.264
<i>She already got to Carima.</i>

03:00.348 --> 03:03.309
- No.
- In Lisbon, three days ago.

03:03.392 --> 03:04.977
We're the only two left.

03:05.061 --> 03:06.062
Hold on.

03:08.314 --> 03:10.066
Devon? Devon, what is it?

03:10.149 --> 03:12.777
- What's going on?
<i>- It's her.</i>

03:12.860 --> 03:13.861
Curaré.

03:16.489 --> 03:18.366
Not my weapon of choice.

03:18.449 --> 03:20.034
But I won't hesitate to use it.

03:30.211 --> 03:32.588
You'll find I'm not as easy
as your other targets.

03:40.763 --> 03:43.015
Society of Assassins
trained us both well, Curaré.

03:43.099 --> 03:45.476
No one can match your skill
with that sword.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.940
But I'll never let you
get close enough to use it.

03:54.026 --> 03:55.194
{933931

04:55.754 --> 04:57.214
Can you hear me, sir?

04:58.257 --> 04:59.467
Sir?

04:59.550 --> 05:00.885
Just like all the others.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.887
<i>She's wiped his mind.</i>

05:12.313 --> 05:14.023
<i>80, the big guy's in Malaysia?</i>

05:14.106 --> 05:16.400
Yup, taking care
of some personal business.

05:16.484 --> 05:19.653
<i>You do know they've just had
a major typhoon in that area.</i>

05:19.737 --> 05:22.031
Yeah. No way for him
to give me any orders.

05:22.114 --> 05:23.574
Now, ain't that a shame?

05:23.657 --> 05:25.242
<i>Aren't you worried?</i>

05:25.326 --> 05:27.745
Believe me, Max,
this is not a man you worry about.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.914
<i>I wasn't talking about him.</i>

05:29.997 --> 05:32.541
Hey, I can handle Gotham
for a few nights without his help.

05:32.625 --> 05:33.625
Whoa!

05:35.419 --> 05:36.879
That almost scratched the paint job.

05:51.769 --> 05:53.020
No need for violence.

05:53.103 --> 05:55.272
I was merely trying
to get your attention.

05:55.356 --> 05:57.608
You've got it. Who are you?

05:57.691 --> 06:02.363
Mutro Botha, at your service.
For a price, of course.

06:02.446 --> 06:05.157
Botha. I've heard of you.

06:05.241 --> 06:07.117
You're a member
of the Society of Assassins.

06:07.201 --> 06:09.703
I am the Society of Assassins.

06:13.165 --> 06:15.000
No need for that.

06:15.084 --> 06:18.671
If my mission had been to kill you,
you would be dead already.

06:18.754 --> 06:21.924
No member of the Society
has ever failed.

06:22.007 --> 06:23.259
Except one.

06:24.009 --> 06:29.265
Yes, because you stepped in to stop her.
In a way, this is all your fault.

06:29.348 --> 06:30.348
What is?

06:30.724 --> 06:33.894
When you prevented Curaré
from killing her target,

06:33.978 --> 06:36.313
the punishment for her failure
was death.

06:38.107 --> 06:43.153
Unfortunately, we underestimated her.
She fought back.

06:43.612 --> 06:49.493
One by one, she hunted us down.
I am the only one left.

06:50.160 --> 06:54.123
And you are the only one
who can keep me that way.

06:54.206 --> 06:55.583
And why should I care to?

06:56.667 --> 07:01.922
Because when she has finished with me,
she will come after you.

07:02.006 --> 07:03.632
Thanks for the warning.

07:03.716 --> 07:06.343
I'll be sure
to look for your name in the obits.

07:06.427 --> 07:08.596
I thought you might feel that way.

07:08.679 --> 07:11.932
So I took the liberty
of providing a little incentive.

07:14.810 --> 07:19.023
I've planted a bomb in your city.
A rather large one.

07:19.106 --> 07:21.150
Set to go off unless it receives

07:21.233 --> 07:24.612
a properly guided signal from me
every 12 hours.

07:31.327 --> 07:32.953
Go ahead. Take it.

07:33.037 --> 07:34.330
It won't do you any good.

07:34.913 --> 07:36.665
Only I know the codes.

07:37.207 --> 07:39.543
I'm not an unreasonable man.

07:39.627 --> 07:43.714
You help me defeat Curare,
and I'll disarm the bomb.

07:45.382 --> 07:50.095
If not, if Curaré gets to me first,
boom.

07:50.554 --> 07:55.351
Gotham experiences
a sudden population decline.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.321
How much time do we have?

08:07.404 --> 08:09.740
Curare's last sighting
puts her at least three hours away.

08:10.199 --> 08:12.469
I'm gonna meet Mutro outside his hotel
in about half an hour.

08:12.493 --> 08:14.787
- What's the plan?
- He's the bait.

08:14.870 --> 08:16.306
When she shows,
I'll get in between them.

08:16.330 --> 08:19.750
This bomb business could get bad.
I'm gonna need your help, Max.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.335
<i>You know you can count on me, Tet.</i>

08:21.418 --> 08:23.170
What do you want me to do?

08:24.171 --> 08:26.011
You've got to find a way
to contact my partner.

08:26.131 --> 08:26.965
Oh.

08:27.049 --> 08:28.967
You know, I never really told you
his name.

08:29.927 --> 08:33.305
Wait, let me guess.
Just a shot in the dark here.

08:33.389 --> 08:35.349
Could it be Bruce Wayne?

08:36.684 --> 08:38.811
I guess it wasn't very hard
to figure out.

08:38.894 --> 08:40.813
Like, the first day.

08:43.107 --> 08:44.858
But even if I get through to Malaysia,

08:44.942 --> 08:47.062
they've been relocating tourists
all over the islands.

08:47.111 --> 08:48.153
He could be anywhere.

08:48.237 --> 08:51.115
Just keep trying. I have faith in you.

08:51.657 --> 08:53.367
I have another idea.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.495
Why don't we do an end run
around your assassin friend?

08:56.578 --> 08:57.722
See if we can locate the bomb.

08:57.746 --> 09:00.666
You keep him on the run
while I search his hotel room.

09:00.749 --> 09:04.753
There is no "we" here, Max.
I don't want you anywhere near this.

09:04.837 --> 09:06.338
These are professional assassins.

09:06.422 --> 09:09.049
You make a mistake around them,
you could get hurt.

09:09.133 --> 09:11.510
And if the bomb goes off,
I could get dead.

09:11.593 --> 09:14.596
That's why you gotta find Bruce, okay?

09:33.198 --> 09:35.033
I'm here. Above you.

09:36.243 --> 09:38.370
- I don't see you.
- You're not supposed to.

09:40.122 --> 09:41.206
Feel better?

09:41.290 --> 09:44.168
I'II feel a lot better
when we're out in the open.

09:46.295 --> 09:50.466
I don't like enclosed spaces.
Not when I'm the quarry.

10:04.354 --> 10:07.024
I can't believe my dad
took both key cards.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.233
Not a problem, miss.

10:17.618 --> 10:19.286
Oh, uh...

10:25.417 --> 10:26.585
Thank you, miss.

10:29.421 --> 10:30.714
There goes my lunch money.

10:34.593 --> 10:38.972
If I were a critical, life-saving clue,
where would I be?

11:00.035 --> 11:01.035
Hmm.

11:14.216 --> 11:15.300
Hey.

11:20.347 --> 11:21.348
Yeah.

11:25.853 --> 11:27.771
- Speak.
- Max, it's me.

11:27.855 --> 11:28.730
Any luck with Bruce?

11:28.814 --> 11:31.400
The satcom's down
for at least another hour.

11:31.483 --> 11:34.027
I got the computer running
an automated search just in case.

11:34.111 --> 11:37.155
Why? Aren't you at home?
Max, what's going on?

11:37.239 --> 11:39.658
Let's just say I'm doing
a little search myself.

11:39.741 --> 11:41.577
Tell me you didn't go to his hotel room.

11:41.660 --> 11:44.079
This isn't a game, Max.
I want you out of there now.

11:44.162 --> 11:47.708
Hey, your suit doesn't give you
barking rights over me, McGinnis.

11:47.791 --> 11:49.835
Besides, as long
as you got your eye on him,

11:49.918 --> 11:51.128
I don't see the danger.

11:53.255 --> 11:55.340
Max! What's happening?

12:24.453 --> 12:25.996
Mutro, Curaré's at the hotel.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.497
My friend's there.

12:27.581 --> 12:29.541
Then your friend is already gone.

12:29.625 --> 12:31.168
I have to go back.

12:33.211 --> 12:34.212
Fool.

12:41.803 --> 12:43.722
Max! Max!

12:47.809 --> 12:49.686
Oh, Terry.

12:49.770 --> 12:50.854
Oh!

12:51.438 --> 12:53.565
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

12:53.649 --> 12:56.735
As soon as she got a good look at me,
she backed off.

12:56.818 --> 12:58.403
Aren't you gonna yell at me?

12:58.487 --> 13:00.322
I figured you already got the message.

13:01.365 --> 13:04.201
I gotta get back.
You go home and stay there.

13:05.786 --> 13:07.621
- And one more thing.
- Yeah?

13:07.704 --> 13:09.289
Don't call me Terry.

13:18.674 --> 13:22.219
Batman. Come in.
I can't stay hidden forever.

13:22.928 --> 13:24.262
Batman!

13:47.536 --> 13:52.040
Lesson number one, Curare.
Always hold on to your weapon.

14:04.886 --> 14:05.886
{933931

14:06.221 --> 14:07.556
No.

14:33.331 --> 14:35.792
He's alive, yeah, but...

14:36.626 --> 14:38.128
Nobody home.

14:58.732 --> 15:00.650
You sure his mind is wiped?

15:03.028 --> 15:05.197
Believe me, he's broccoli.

15:05.947 --> 15:07.199
It's all my fault.

15:07.282 --> 15:10.118
If you'd been there
instead of running off to protect me...

15:10.202 --> 15:12.245
Listen, Max, ever hear the expression

15:12.329 --> 15:13.997
"Live by the sword, die by the sword"?

15:14.081 --> 15:16.708
Mutro was an assassin.
He made his own bed.

15:16.792 --> 15:19.586
Besides, we got bigger things
to worry about.

15:23.799 --> 15:25.359
Feeling guilty isn't gonna help anyone.

15:25.926 --> 15:27.844
Come on, Max, what can we do with it?

15:29.679 --> 15:31.890
This is a broadband transmitter.

15:31.973 --> 15:33.850
It's not gonna help us find the bomb.

15:36.937 --> 15:37.771
Hmm.

15:37.854 --> 15:39.856
"Hmm"? "Hmm" is good, right?

15:40.524 --> 15:41.900
It's a start.

15:44.694 --> 15:48.573
The specs on this model say the signal
has a radius of only two miles.

15:48.657 --> 15:50.075
Well, how does that help us?

15:50.158 --> 15:53.495
This is why you should try
to stay awake in geometry, McGinnis.

15:56.832 --> 15:58.625
You saw him activate it here.

15:58.708 --> 16:00.937
Then you would've been at the park
when the timer runs down

16:00.961 --> 16:02.337
so he would have to set it there.

16:02.420 --> 16:05.549
Then he must have set it
at least once at the hotel.

16:05.632 --> 16:06.883
<i>And voila.</i>

16:06.967 --> 16:09.136
Math is once again your friend.

16:09.219 --> 16:10.929
Well, that's about
two square blocks.

16:11.012 --> 16:13.515
If we had a couple of days,
we might be able to find the bomb.

16:13.598 --> 16:16.476
Wait. I've got Mutro's cash card.

16:16.560 --> 16:18.204
It'll tell us
where he's been spending money

16:18.228 --> 16:19.354
in the last few days.

16:21.690 --> 16:24.484
This is the only location
inside the highlighted area.

16:24.568 --> 16:28.196
And he visited it twice.
That's gotta be where it is.

16:28.280 --> 16:30.073
The Gotham Museum of Armaments?

16:30.157 --> 16:32.997
What better place to hide a weapon
than a place that's filled with them?

16:34.619 --> 16:36.329
- Let's go.
- No way.

16:36.413 --> 16:39.249
Two of us gives us twice the chance
to find the bomb.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.543
You need me on this one, Terry.
You know you do.

16:44.004 --> 16:46.673
Ow! Could you get your ear
out of my eye?

16:46.756 --> 16:47.841
I warned you.

16:47.924 --> 16:49.652
The Batmobile wasn't meant
to carry two people.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.052
All those billions,

16:51.136 --> 16:53.054
and you'd think
he could afford a backseat.

17:03.565 --> 17:05.650
Oh, man, where to begin?

17:05.734 --> 17:06.735
With this.

17:08.069 --> 17:08.987
Frequency scanner.

17:09.070 --> 17:10.113
It locates hot receivers.

17:10.197 --> 17:13.158
That Batcave of yours
is like one big toy chest, isn't it?

17:22.876 --> 17:24.556
It's just one
of the guards' communicators.

17:27.797 --> 17:29.132
At least we know it works.

17:35.263 --> 17:36.263
Batman!

17:38.433 --> 17:39.559
Catch!

17:43.355 --> 17:44.648
Keep looking!

17:47.859 --> 17:49.861
Oh, man. Nothing like a little pressure.

17:52.530 --> 17:55.951
Curaré, listen to me.
Mutro planted a bomb.

17:56.034 --> 17:59.079
If it goes off,
it'll kill thousands, including you.

17:59.162 --> 18:00.372
Or don't you care?

18:02.540 --> 18:04.167
I'll take that as a no.

18:11.925 --> 18:12.926
Sorry, buddy.

18:19.391 --> 18:20.392
Oh, great.

18:33.780 --> 18:34.781
Oh, no.

18:48.336 --> 18:49.337
This is hopeless.

19:20.410 --> 19:21.661
I found it!

19:21.745 --> 19:23.455
Can you disarm it?

19:24.581 --> 19:26.624
If I had some help.

19:26.708 --> 19:28.168
You're on your own, Max.

19:37.260 --> 19:39.846
I don't know.
I don't know, I don't know.

19:42.724 --> 19:44.726
Max, we're running out of time here.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.521
Flack it.

20:05.163 --> 20:06.164
Max?

20:07.123 --> 20:08.375
Can we go home now?

20:13.838 --> 20:15.215
How do you do it?

20:15.298 --> 20:17.342
- Do what?
- This hero thing.

20:17.425 --> 20:20.136
It's easier for me. I got the suit.

20:20.220 --> 20:24.057
No. How do you save the world
and not tell anybody?

20:24.140 --> 20:26.518
I can tell you. You can tell me.

20:26.601 --> 20:28.103
That's why I'm glad you found out,

20:28.436 --> 20:29.562
<i>partner.</i>
