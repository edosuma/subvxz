WEBVTT

03:50.813 --> 03:53.482
My dad used to call me Klutzy-

03:53.650 --> 03:57.152
This one time he took me
to a shooting range

03:57.320 --> 04:00.113
and l dropped the loaded pistol

04:00.281 --> 04:03.116
and it shot his best friend
in the butt.

04:03.284 --> 04:05.035
And so all he could say was,

04:05.203 --> 04:08.664
"Well, Klutzy's gone
and done it again-"

04:08.831 --> 04:11.333
How did that make you feel?

04:13.127 --> 04:14.544
Not so good-

04:14.712 --> 04:16.630
Not as bad as the guy
that got shot.

04:19.634 --> 04:22.094
Anyway, Gary picked up on it-

04:22.262 --> 04:24.763
And after that
we'd all get together

04:24.931 --> 04:27.099
and they would trade
Kiutzy stories.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.893
And of course there were
a lot of them.

04:30.061 --> 04:32.771
I don't know what it is
about me-

04:32.939 --> 04:36.149
You know, I really-- I try

04:36.317 --> 04:39.236
but I always mess up-
I always mess up-

04:51.291 --> 04:53.667
Don't you think, Daddy?

05:08.933 --> 05:11.268
Hello-

05:11.436 --> 05:12.811
Hi Grandma-

05:12.979 --> 05:14.354
No, she's sleeping-

05:17.066 --> 05:19.443
Uh-huh-

05:21.904 --> 05:23.530
Okay-

05:23.698 --> 05:25.407
It's out-

05:25.575 --> 05:27.492
Good night, Grandma-

05:29.203 --> 05:31.788
Everyone is here
because of mistakes they made---

05:33.374 --> 05:35.917
myself included-

05:36.085 --> 05:40.255
That really doesn't make me
feel any better-

05:40.423 --> 05:42.758
Well, at least you know
you're not alone-

05:46.554 --> 05:49.389
You're right- I'm sorry-

05:49.557 --> 05:52.809
Lorraine, you're apologizing again-

05:52.977 --> 05:57.814
So I hear that Gary has filed
for soie custody of Chad.

05:57.982 --> 05:59.483
Yes-

06:05.490 --> 06:08.992
Mommy, ice cream- Mom-

06:10.411 --> 06:12.371
Mommy, ice cream-

06:24.967 --> 06:26.426
How are you feeling about that?

06:26.594 --> 06:29.346
Helpless-

06:29.514 --> 06:31.390
Angry?

06:33.434 --> 06:35.268
Guilty-

06:35.436 --> 06:36.853
Why guilty?

06:37.021 --> 06:39.356
Because it was
my responsibility-

06:39.524 --> 06:41.817
Do you think it's your fault?

06:41.984 --> 06:44.569
Well, I guess so-
I can't blame Gary-

06:44.737 --> 06:46.363
I can't go blaming
the ice cream man-

06:46.531 --> 06:48.365
I'm the one who let him
run out in the street

06:48.533 --> 06:50.117
and nearly get hit
by an ice cream truck-

06:50.284 --> 06:51.701
It's not about blame, Lorraine-

06:51.869 --> 06:54.996
It's about coming to terms
with your anger.

06:55.164 --> 06:57.916
You have a right to be angry-

07:00.628 --> 07:02.796
Who are you angry with?

07:04.882 --> 07:07.134
Myself-

07:08.386 --> 07:09.761
Anyone else?

07:11.347 --> 07:13.515
It's like--

07:13.683 --> 07:16.393
It's like Gary said--
it was on my watch-

07:16.561 --> 07:19.229
Gary was the one
who deserted you and Chad-

07:19.397 --> 07:21.356
That doesn't give me an excuse
to be careless-

07:21.524 --> 07:24.484
Lorraine, you fell asleep after a hard
day's work- That's not a crime-

07:24.652 --> 07:26.528
Well, it is in the military-
They can shoot you for it-

07:26.696 --> 07:28.113
Is that what you want?

07:28.281 --> 07:30.782
Get me a gun-
I'll shoot you myself-

07:30.950 --> 07:35.036
Okay, Betty, we've talked
about these outbursts-

07:35.204 --> 07:37.080
It's okay- It's not her fault-

07:37.248 --> 07:39.458
You have your own pain, you know-
We all do.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.334
You know what?
You know what your problem is?

07:41.502 --> 07:43.712
You're too nice-
She's too nice-

07:43.880 --> 07:46.506
That's what her problem is-
I mean, look at you-

07:46.674 --> 07:49.342
After all the stuff that
that jarhead did to you,

07:49.510 --> 07:51.553
you still can't even say
a word about him.

07:51.721 --> 07:54.347
Look, she's still wearing
the bum's ring-

07:54.515 --> 07:55.515
Betty-

07:55.683 --> 07:58.310
- Listen -- and he's not a jarhead-
- Yeah, he is.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.312
No, he's not.
He's an army sergeant-

08:00.480 --> 08:02.856
And it was my dad
who was the marine, remember?

08:03.024 --> 08:06.234
You know what?
GI, jarhead, daddy, husband--

08:06.402 --> 08:08.445
what's the difference
when you're still taking orders?

08:08.613 --> 08:10.363
I mean, correct me if I'm wrong,

08:10.531 --> 08:12.741
but didn't Sergeant Gary
get court-martiaied?

08:12.909 --> 08:15.160
He ought to be in jail-

08:15.328 --> 08:17.454
You know what?
Don't be a wimp, Lorraine-

08:17.622 --> 08:19.915
Who cares if you have
the right to be angry?

08:20.082 --> 08:22.918
Just be angry,
for God's sakes-

08:25.713 --> 08:27.672
- Come on, Max-
- See you next week-

08:27.840 --> 08:30.967
- Bye, Mrs- Burton-
- Bye, Sal.

08:32.220 --> 08:34.346
Mom, I thought you quit-

08:34.514 --> 08:36.097
I did-

08:36.265 --> 08:37.432
Let's go get some pizza-

08:37.600 --> 08:38.892
You got enough money?

08:39.059 --> 08:41.645
Sure Mom's got some money-

09:24.772 --> 09:26.856
Okay, come on, hon-

09:27.024 --> 09:28.733
I'm playing my game-

09:28.901 --> 09:31.403
No, Chad, you've got to come inside
with me, alright?

09:31.571 --> 09:34.489
I want to beat this level-

09:34.657 --> 09:36.783
All right,
but you stay in the car

09:36.951 --> 09:38.159
where I can see you-

09:38.327 --> 09:40.036
- Okay-
- All right-

09:40.204 --> 09:41.621
Thanks, Mom-

10:12.153 --> 10:14.404
Look at 'em-

10:14.572 --> 10:18.241
Some guy probably ran a red light
and got the whole force after him-

10:18.409 --> 10:21.077
But where are they when you need 'em?
That's what I'm saying-

10:21.245 --> 10:24.623
Hey, in my line of work
they're my best friends-

10:24.790 --> 10:27.125
Yeah, you're right.
But I bet you've got a better friend---

10:27.293 --> 10:29.502
under this counter here, huh?

10:29.670 --> 10:31.379
Have a nice day-

10:42.558 --> 10:44.684
A lot of creeps out there, huh?

10:44.852 --> 10:48.355
Would you like something else?

10:48.522 --> 10:50.398
Uh, yeah-

10:50.566 --> 10:52.484
A pack of American Spirit blue, please-

10:52.652 --> 10:54.319
Okay-

11:01.744 --> 11:04.537
- Thank you-
- Thank you-

11:19.220 --> 11:20.887
Here you go, bud-

11:23.057 --> 11:25.308
I thought we were gonna
get pizza.

11:25.476 --> 11:27.519
It is pizza, sweetheart-

11:27.687 --> 11:29.604
Real pizza-

11:29.772 --> 11:31.981
It is real pizza-

11:32.149 --> 11:34.776
You'll see, it's good-

11:41.909 --> 11:43.702
Oh shit-

11:43.869 --> 11:45.745
Mommy, you said "shit-"

11:45.913 --> 11:47.497
Don't say "shit," honey-

11:47.665 --> 11:50.208
I didn't say it- You did-

11:50.376 --> 11:52.711
I know, I know, I know, I know-

11:52.878 --> 11:54.003
Okay-

11:54.171 --> 11:56.631
We need gas again?

11:56.799 --> 11:58.800
Yes-

12:14.942 --> 12:16.443
I forgot gas-

12:16.610 --> 12:17.986
How much?

12:18.154 --> 12:20.447
Yeah, let's see-

12:20.614 --> 12:23.908
Hold on-

12:26.871 --> 12:29.581
$6, please-

12:32.001 --> 12:34.002
Excuse me-

12:37.506 --> 12:39.090
Hey-

12:41.010 --> 12:42.844
I'm sorry-

12:43.846 --> 12:47.891
Yeah, I know-
I'm sorry, Gary- Please-

12:51.937 --> 12:53.938
Listen to me.
Why are you doing this to me?

12:54.106 --> 12:56.316
I can't do this, okay?
I can't do this.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.985
Chad's waiting for me, okay?

13:00.905 --> 13:02.363
Okay-

13:02.531 --> 13:04.908
I mean it, Gary- Stop-

13:05.075 --> 13:07.410
Please stop-

13:07.578 --> 13:09.954
You're the one who left me,
remember?

13:14.001 --> 13:16.669
I'm sorry-
I'm sorry-

13:52.248 --> 13:53.540
Are you ready for pizza?

13:53.707 --> 13:56.084
Do we have enough for Roy?

13:56.252 --> 13:57.585
Who's Roy?

14:01.799 --> 14:03.174
Oh please-

14:03.342 --> 14:05.677
Oh my God, please don't hurt us-
Please get out of our car-

14:05.845 --> 14:08.763
I'm not gonna hurt you-
I'm not gonna hurt your boy either-

14:08.931 --> 14:11.599
We don't have any money-
We don't have any money-

14:11.767 --> 14:13.893
- Believe me, we don't.
- I don't want your mo-- shh-

14:14.061 --> 14:17.063
I don't want your money.
You got a car, don't you?

14:17.231 --> 14:19.649
Just drive-

14:23.863 --> 14:25.738
Nice and easy-

14:25.906 --> 14:28.449
Just drive-

15:01.984 --> 15:04.193
Sure you want to get
such a good look at me?

15:05.905 --> 15:08.489
May be healthier not to-

15:09.909 --> 15:11.743
Oh man-

15:11.911 --> 15:13.745
Oh God, you're bleeding-

15:13.913 --> 15:15.538
Roy: Huh?

15:15.706 --> 15:17.498
- On your hand-
- Mm-hmm.

15:17.666 --> 15:19.751
There's a first-aid kit

15:19.919 --> 15:21.920
under the seat in the back-

15:22.087 --> 15:23.796
What?

15:23.964 --> 15:27.091
I have it in case
there's an accident or--

15:27.259 --> 15:29.761
It ain't my blood, lady-

15:29.929 --> 15:31.137
Whose blood is it?

15:32.139 --> 15:34.515
Oh, it's just general blood-

15:34.683 --> 15:35.808
Like an army general?

15:35.976 --> 15:38.811
You're funny.
You got a cute kid here-

15:38.979 --> 15:40.688
My daddy is in the army-

15:40.856 --> 15:42.690
No way-

15:42.858 --> 15:45.234
Where's he at tonight?

15:45.402 --> 15:46.945
He's at home-

15:47.112 --> 15:49.364
We just stepped out
to get something to eat-

15:49.531 --> 15:50.865
Oh yeah?

15:51.033 --> 15:53.242
What did you guys get?
Mind if I take a look?

15:53.410 --> 15:56.412
Check it out--
two whole mini-pizzas-

15:56.580 --> 16:00.041
You were planning quite a feast
for the three of you, huh?

16:00.209 --> 16:03.211
Could have invited the neighbors-
Just kidding.

16:03.379 --> 16:05.088
You see that park
up here on the right?

16:05.255 --> 16:07.632
Want to pull over there, please?

16:10.177 --> 16:13.554
Okay- Oh man-

16:22.231 --> 16:24.232
That's good-

16:31.824 --> 16:33.032
Hey there, bud-

16:33.200 --> 16:35.535
I'll be back in a jiffy-

16:38.497 --> 16:40.289
It's gonna be all right-

16:41.750 --> 16:43.751
Oh my God-

16:46.296 --> 16:48.464
Yeah, it's Roy-

16:48.632 --> 16:51.551
Did you make it there all right?

16:53.012 --> 16:55.013
What?

16:57.016 --> 16:58.933
Fuck.
God damn it-

17:01.186 --> 17:03.271
Same shit happened to me-
There's roadblocks everywhere,

17:03.439 --> 17:06.607
all over the goddamn place-

17:06.775 --> 17:08.859
No, you stay there, all right?

17:09.028 --> 17:11.279
It'll take me six hours-
I'll be there.

17:11.446 --> 17:12.989
Stay there-

17:13.156 --> 17:15.157
Yeah-

17:17.118 --> 17:20.829
It's okay- All right-

17:43.062 --> 17:46.064
Hey, bud, why don't you
hop in the back seat, all right?

17:47.649 --> 17:49.650
Go ahead-

17:50.861 --> 17:53.988
Get on in there- Yeah-
There you go.

17:55.949 --> 17:58.409
Nice and clean-

17:58.577 --> 18:01.162
Now we're one big,
happy family, huh?

18:31.318 --> 18:33.319
Where are you taking us?

18:33.487 --> 18:36.447
Well, it's more like
where you're taking me, huh?

18:36.615 --> 18:38.616
You know how to find
the highway from here?

18:38.784 --> 18:42.078
Um, I think so-

18:42.246 --> 18:44.914
Do you know how to find the highway
from here? It's a simple question-

18:45.082 --> 18:48.167
Yes, I do-

18:48.335 --> 18:49.961
Sorry, I just--

18:50.129 --> 18:52.630
my shrink tells me I have a hard time
dealing with ambiguity.

18:52.798 --> 18:55.466
That means let's cut the maybes,

18:55.634 --> 18:58.177
the I-don't-think-sos, the probablys-
You know what I mean?

18:58.345 --> 19:00.221
- Mm-hmm.
- You understand?

19:00.389 --> 19:02.223
I do- Actually it's really funny,

19:02.391 --> 19:04.392
because my therapist says

19:04.560 --> 19:07.436
that I am too ambiguous-

19:07.604 --> 19:09.480
I am too ambiguous-

19:09.648 --> 19:12.525
Let's just go to the highway-

19:15.404 --> 19:17.446
Right-

19:19.950 --> 19:21.159
Mommy-

19:21.326 --> 19:22.451
Yeah, hon?

19:22.619 --> 19:24.620
Are you crying again?

19:26.290 --> 19:29.917
- Who's crying?
- Mommy's crying-

19:30.085 --> 19:32.044
I'm not crying, honey-

19:32.212 --> 19:34.589
I think you're right, buddy.
I think your mom is crying-

19:34.756 --> 19:36.757
Now why are you crying?

19:38.802 --> 19:42.096
Chad says you're crying again-
Why would he say that?

19:43.682 --> 19:46.350
- What's your mom's name, bud?
- Lorraine-

19:46.518 --> 19:48.436
Lorraine? Holy shit-

19:48.604 --> 19:50.479
Mommy, Roy said "shit-"

19:50.647 --> 19:53.065
- Don't say "shit," honey-
- Now you said it.

19:53.233 --> 19:55.276
I'm sorry- I apologize-

19:55.444 --> 19:58.029
Lorraine-- you know,
such a beautiful name-

19:58.197 --> 20:00.990
I had a very speciai woman
in my life named Lorraine actually-

20:01.158 --> 20:02.491
Really?

20:02.659 --> 20:06.120
She had an intimate relationship
with my backside in my formative years--

20:06.288 --> 20:09.415
yeah, her and her little
hickory stick.

20:09.583 --> 20:12.084
Never mind there, buddy.
You wouldn't understand-

20:12.252 --> 20:15.588
But that's my tale of woe-
We've all got 'em, right?

20:15.756 --> 20:17.048
Yeah-

20:17.216 --> 20:19.217
- It's a joke-
- What?

20:19.384 --> 20:22.220
Lorraine, "backside, tail"--

20:22.387 --> 20:24.555
- You get it? What's that called?
- Yeah yeah, I get it.

20:24.723 --> 20:26.015
A pun-

20:26.183 --> 20:28.142
- Huh?
- It's called a pun-

20:28.310 --> 20:29.602
- A pun, yeah-
- Yeah.

20:29.770 --> 20:32.480
You're right.
You've got a smart mama there, boy-

20:32.648 --> 20:35.441
I hope she's a better mom
than mine was-

20:35.609 --> 20:37.902
Mom wasn't nice to you, huh?

20:41.823 --> 20:43.783
I'm sorry-

20:44.826 --> 20:46.535
Just find the freeway, okay?

20:46.703 --> 20:48.829
Yeah, okay-

21:26.660 --> 21:29.870
Um, there's a roadblock-

21:33.667 --> 21:35.251
- You see that?
- Yeah- Oh yeah-

21:35.419 --> 21:37.545
And that's for little old me-

21:37.713 --> 21:39.171
So I'm gonna turn around, okay?

21:39.339 --> 21:40.923
No, I want you to do
what I tell you to do-

21:41.091 --> 21:43.259
I want you to relax
and drive the car-

21:43.427 --> 21:46.220
So why don't we be the nice little
happy fake family that we are?

21:46.388 --> 21:48.848
And we'll go through smiling, okay?

21:49.016 --> 21:50.474
Just relax.

21:52.519 --> 21:54.437
Just drive-

22:10.537 --> 22:11.495
Easy, Lorraine-

22:19.379 --> 22:21.172
Evening, folks-

22:21.340 --> 22:23.591
What's going on, Officer?

22:23.759 --> 22:26.135
We've got a couple bank robbers
on the loose.

22:26.303 --> 22:28.262
Don't be alarmed-
We got them bottled up-

22:28.430 --> 22:30.139
You folks heading out of town?

22:30.307 --> 22:32.183
Um, yes-

22:32.351 --> 22:33.267
Where to?

22:33.435 --> 22:35.186
We're just going a couple exits
down the highway

22:35.354 --> 22:37.188
to that new steak joint-
You been there?

22:37.356 --> 22:39.023
Yeah, it's pretty good-

22:39.191 --> 22:41.108
Look, I'm gonna need
to see your ID-

22:42.152 --> 22:43.652
Yeah, no problem-

22:49.242 --> 22:51.660
Do you have a description
of the robbers, Officer?

22:51.828 --> 22:53.537
Maybe we've seen something-

22:57.501 --> 23:00.169
There's not much of one-
Two white males--

23:00.337 --> 23:02.421
one medium-build, one heavyset-

23:02.589 --> 23:03.631
What did they do?

23:03.799 --> 23:07.843
Walked into a bank in broad daylight
and took a whole bunch of money-

23:26.154 --> 23:29.073
We've only got one witness who saw
anything. It's the sheriff's deputy.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.200
He's in the hospital right now
getting bullets taken out.

23:31.368 --> 23:33.327
Oh, one of them shot him?

23:33.495 --> 23:35.579
Jesus- It's too bad-

23:35.747 --> 23:38.290
So is he the only one
that got shot or--?

23:38.458 --> 23:40.584
No, we think we got
one of the bank robbers too-

23:57.477 --> 23:59.478
I guess you used to be
in the military, huh?

24:04.025 --> 24:06.694
Can't say I blame you
for letting it grow-

24:06.862 --> 24:08.946
Yeah-

24:10.073 --> 24:12.616
Is there anything else
we can do for you, sir?

24:13.910 --> 24:16.036
Yeah, there's just one thing-

24:19.499 --> 24:21.584
You know you're breaking
the law, don't you?

24:31.136 --> 24:33.012
Your son needs to be
in a seat belt-

24:34.097 --> 24:36.432
Oh- Chad, what did I
tell you, buddy?

24:36.600 --> 24:37.892
Are you gonna give us a ticket,
Officer?

24:38.059 --> 24:40.060
- You gotta put your belt on-
- Not right now.

24:40.228 --> 24:43.355
Little man, do me a favor- Make sure
that seat belt's buckled at all times-

24:43.523 --> 24:45.399
Yeah, we got it-
I'm sorry, Officer-

24:45.567 --> 24:47.193
You folks have a good night-

24:47.360 --> 24:48.736
Thank you-

24:49.738 --> 24:51.739
Drive-

25:16.598 --> 25:20.351
Why did that officer think
I used to be in the military?

25:20.519 --> 25:22.394
Did you?
Maybe he could tell-

25:22.562 --> 25:26.649
That's a theory, Lorraine,
except I never was in the military-

25:30.320 --> 25:32.321
Let me show you something-

25:34.115 --> 25:35.908
This is my ID-

25:38.286 --> 25:41.205
Not a bad shot, huh?
I want to see yours.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.165
Oh, my-- no-

25:43.333 --> 25:45.501
It's such a terrible picture-
I hate it so much.

25:45.669 --> 25:47.920
Yeah, but I want to see it-
Oh, here we go-

25:48.088 --> 25:49.922
Come here-

25:50.090 --> 25:52.216
What have we got here?

25:52.384 --> 25:54.468
Aha- Hey, little man,

25:54.636 --> 25:56.387
who's in that picture, eh?

25:56.555 --> 25:59.473
That's me and Mommy-

25:59.641 --> 26:01.475
- And?
- And Daddy-

26:01.643 --> 26:02.560
And Daddy-

26:02.727 --> 26:05.729
Not me-

26:05.897 --> 26:07.856
- I'm sorry.
- Well, I think I'll be in charge

26:08.024 --> 26:10.568
of the family finances
from now on,

26:10.735 --> 26:13.404
except there's no cash-

26:13.572 --> 26:16.574
You've got no credit cards.
What do you guys do for money?

26:16.741 --> 26:19.034
I don't get paid till Friday,
alright?

26:19.202 --> 26:21.579
Well, that seems weird.
So what do you do Monday,

26:21.746 --> 26:23.414
Tuesday, Wednesday--
all the days--?

26:23.582 --> 26:26.458
- We get by.
- Get by on frozen mini-pizzas

26:26.626 --> 26:28.085
Is what you get by on, huh?

26:28.253 --> 26:30.629
You could buy a loaf of bread
and a jar of peanut butter for Chad

26:30.797 --> 26:32.756
- with all the money that it cost for-- - Are you
questioning

26:32.924 --> 26:34.592
how I feed my child?

26:34.759 --> 26:36.719
- Whoa, put your hands on the wheel-
- I'm sorry- Okay-

26:36.886 --> 26:38.053
- Control the goddamn car-
- Okay-

26:38.221 --> 26:40.222
Are you forgetting what this is?

26:40.390 --> 26:41.640
No-

26:41.808 --> 26:44.393
Who do you think has control
of this situation, huh?

26:44.561 --> 26:46.395
You do-

26:46.563 --> 26:47.980
Well, that's good
you know that.

26:48.148 --> 26:51.025
It's strange, 'cause a guy
with a deadly firearm in your car--

26:51.192 --> 26:53.235
I thought I set
the ground rules for you-

26:53.403 --> 26:55.321
But your mom-- she's a bit---

26:55.488 --> 26:57.990
Loopy-
She's forgetting some details-

26:58.158 --> 27:00.576
- I was just trying to--
- Well, now you're a little fuzzy

27:00.744 --> 27:03.495
on the detaiis, so what I want to do
is start over and lay them out for you-

27:03.663 --> 27:06.290
As long as I'm in this car,
there's gonna be no more crying,

27:06.458 --> 27:08.876
lying or chit-chat-
You understand me?

27:09.044 --> 27:11.587
Fine- You're just not
understanding what I'm sa--

27:11.755 --> 27:14.465
Uh-uh, that sounds like chit-chat,
Lorraine-

27:14.633 --> 27:16.091
We just covered that-

27:16.259 --> 27:19.094
If you take me
where I gotta go

27:19.262 --> 27:21.138
and you don't lie,

27:21.306 --> 27:24.850
everything's gonna be fine.
You and your boy will be safe-

27:26.353 --> 27:28.479
This is what we call
a little grace period

27:28.647 --> 27:30.939
and it starts now-

27:52.379 --> 27:53.962
What have you got
in that pocket there?

27:54.130 --> 27:55.506
What?

27:55.674 --> 27:57.716
Now don't play innocent
with me, Lorraine.

27:57.884 --> 27:59.510
In your little pocket-

27:59.678 --> 28:00.969
What?

28:04.724 --> 28:07.851
Oh. I-- I quit.
I'm trying to quit-

28:08.019 --> 28:10.854
- Sorry, buddy.
- It's okay, Mom-

28:11.022 --> 28:13.148
- Have one- It will calm your nerves-
- No- No, thank you-

28:13.316 --> 28:15.109
- How about you, bud?
- No.

28:15.276 --> 28:17.528
I'm kidding.
You're not gonna be a smoker-

28:17.696 --> 28:19.655
It's a horrible habit-

28:33.712 --> 28:35.838
What?

28:37.716 --> 28:39.717
You're a beautiful woman-

28:47.726 --> 28:50.686
You seem a little sad though-

28:55.567 --> 28:57.776
I bet you clean up real nice-

29:01.990 --> 29:04.700
Looks like we're running out
of gas.

29:04.868 --> 29:06.785
So why don't we stop?
We've got a long trip ahead of us-

29:06.953 --> 29:09.663
Well, as you have seen,
I don't have a dime.

29:09.831 --> 29:11.331
- Yeah, no shit-
- Mommy.

29:11.499 --> 29:14.960
Sorry- That's two strikes for Roy-
I'm sorry.

29:16.296 --> 29:19.506
I'm rather flush at the moment,
so it shouldn't be a problem-

29:19.674 --> 29:21.884
Let's get some gas-

30:06.805 --> 30:08.263
Hi-

30:08.431 --> 30:10.432
Let's go to that diner over there-

30:22.529 --> 30:24.029
- Are you hungry, bud?
- Pardon me-

30:24.197 --> 30:26.031
I'll get you whatever you want-
What do you iike?

30:26.199 --> 30:27.825
I want chocolate milk-

30:27.992 --> 30:29.785
Chocolate milk, huh?
Let's go over here, Lorraine-

30:29.953 --> 30:31.537
And pie-- he likes pie-

30:31.704 --> 30:33.789
That's a lot of sugar, but okay-

30:33.957 --> 30:36.708
Let's get some burgers too, huh,
with some pickles, some ketchup?

30:36.876 --> 30:38.836
Can I still have
the chocolate milk?

30:39.003 --> 30:40.921
Sure. I toid you,
whatever you want-

30:41.089 --> 30:42.840
I have to go to the bathroom-
Come on, buddy-

30:43.007 --> 30:44.925
Okay, well, Chad is gonna--
he's gonna stay with me-

30:45.093 --> 30:46.969
We're gonna order our food,
right, bud?

30:47.136 --> 30:50.347
Be quick, all right?
Come sit with me, bud-

30:53.017 --> 30:55.769
Lorraine, we'll be right here,
so hurry up, okay?

30:58.523 --> 31:00.566
Oh my God-

31:06.239 --> 31:08.615
Shit-

31:14.080 --> 31:16.790
You want a pork rind?

31:18.877 --> 31:21.336
Don't hurt my mom-

31:22.505 --> 31:24.923
- I'm not gonna hurt your mom-
- Are you listening?

31:25.091 --> 31:28.760
I'm listening to you.
I'm not gonna hurt you or your mom-

31:28.928 --> 31:31.555
You've just got to do what I say
a little longer-

31:38.062 --> 31:39.938
Hancock-- near Hancock-

31:40.106 --> 31:42.733
Off Highway 61 -
I need some help, please-

31:42.901 --> 31:45.068
- What city, please?
- I don't know what city.

31:45.236 --> 31:46.778
Can you speak louder?
I can't hear you-

31:46.946 --> 31:47.905
What?

31:49.324 --> 31:51.283
Hold on-

31:54.621 --> 31:56.622
- You play baseball or what?
- Tee ball-

31:56.789 --> 31:58.332
Tee ball? What position?

31:59.334 --> 32:01.793
You don't know?
Your dad never told you?

32:01.961 --> 32:04.963
What's he doing-- this guy?
He's got to step it up a notch-

32:05.131 --> 32:07.633
Me-- I played second base-

32:08.635 --> 32:11.428
So if you want to hit
those home runs,

32:11.596 --> 32:14.973
you've got to get ready-
You've got to wait for that pitch-

32:15.141 --> 32:18.268
Bang!

32:18.436 --> 32:19.978
A mile away.
You see that thing go?

32:20.146 --> 32:22.397
Come on, you try-
You try-

32:23.900 --> 32:25.150
You're a righty, huh?

32:25.318 --> 32:27.319
All right, now you want to wait
for that pitch.

32:27.487 --> 32:30.614
it's all in the hips.
Look at that pitcher in the eye-

32:30.782 --> 32:33.951
Three, two, one-

32:34.118 --> 32:35.994
Boom! Whoa-

32:36.162 --> 32:38.497
See, now that would have been
a home run, buddy.

32:38.665 --> 32:41.708
Don't forget
what I taught you, okay?

32:41.876 --> 32:43.919
Your mom's awfully slow,
isn't she?

32:44.087 --> 32:46.588
Let's go see what's going on-

32:48.508 --> 32:51.218
Lorraine, how is it going
in there?

32:51.386 --> 32:54.596
- I'll be right there-
- Lorraine, turn the water off-

32:54.764 --> 32:56.181
We've got to get moving here-

32:56.349 --> 32:58.976
Hello- Um, is this 911?

32:59.143 --> 33:00.811
This is Information-
Who are you caiiing?

33:00.979 --> 33:03.981
- Wait, it's not 911?
- No, this is Information-

33:04.148 --> 33:06.024
Hello? What?

33:06.192 --> 33:08.026
Oh my God-
Oh my God-

33:08.194 --> 33:09.820
Are you talking to somebody
in there?

33:09.988 --> 33:11.697
Hold on-

33:11.864 --> 33:14.157
Oh my God-
Oh my God-

33:18.538 --> 33:21.623
All right, you've got 10 seconds
or I'm taking Chad with me-

33:23.960 --> 33:26.003
Okay okay.

33:28.548 --> 33:30.757
Hey, Lorraine,
how are we doing in there?

33:32.385 --> 33:34.011
Oh-

33:35.722 --> 33:38.098
Yeah, we're gonna
leave you behind.

33:40.601 --> 33:43.353
What the hell are you doing
in there, Lorraine?

33:44.355 --> 33:46.273
Excuse me-

33:46.441 --> 33:47.774
I was praying-

34:20.516 --> 34:23.268
Mm- Good, huh?

34:23.436 --> 34:24.978
Mm-hmm-

34:25.146 --> 34:26.855
Sure you don't want
a burger, Lorraine?

34:27.023 --> 34:28.982
I'm not hungry-

34:29.150 --> 34:31.234
You don't know what
you're missing, Lorraine-

34:31.402 --> 34:33.320
These are truck-stop burgers,
right?

34:33.487 --> 34:37.364
None of those prefab fast-food crap,
right, bud?

34:38.576 --> 34:41.745
You've got a good boy here,
Lorraine-

34:41.913 --> 34:44.039
Look, how about
some French fries?

34:44.206 --> 34:46.123
At least have a fry.
You've got to eat something-

34:46.292 --> 34:49.043
Come on.
You need to eat something-

34:49.212 --> 34:50.087
Thank you-

34:50.254 --> 34:53.090
Yeah. Here.
It's pretty good-

34:53.257 --> 34:54.674
What is that?

34:54.842 --> 34:56.717
- Huh?
- Under the bag-

34:56.886 --> 34:58.762
Oh, show your mom-

34:58.930 --> 35:01.890
How about that, huh?
Amazing-

35:02.058 --> 35:04.726
You can get anything
in a truck stop these days,

35:04.894 --> 35:06.937
even love, so I'm told-

35:07.105 --> 35:09.648
Well, he already has one-
His dad bought it for him-

35:09.816 --> 35:12.943
Actually you're wrong about that,
'cause I asked him- He doesn't-

35:14.612 --> 35:15.946
I'll see you in a bit-

35:16.114 --> 35:18.698
I'm going up front, buddy,
going up front-

35:21.160 --> 35:23.578
Jesus, Roy-

35:29.544 --> 35:32.379
So remember

35:32.547 --> 35:35.090
when I told you we had
a long drive ahead of us?

35:35.258 --> 35:36.967
You never asked how far-

35:37.135 --> 35:40.345
Well, I figured you'd tell me
if you wanted me to know-

35:40.513 --> 35:43.014
You're in control
of the situation, remember?

35:43.182 --> 35:47.060
Good girl-
You're learning-

35:47.228 --> 35:50.147
Basically I've got a rendezvous
with a partner of mine

35:50.314 --> 35:52.357
about 350 miles away-

35:52.525 --> 35:55.152
You think you can make it there
with no hiccups,

35:55.319 --> 35:57.237
no speeding tickets?

35:58.990 --> 36:00.365
I think so-

36:02.160 --> 36:04.953
I mean, yes-
Definitely yes-

36:05.121 --> 36:08.165
- You're a fast learner-
- Yeah, thanks-

37:21.072 --> 37:22.989
Slow down, Lorraine-
What are you doing?

37:23.157 --> 37:24.407
There's a cop behind us-

37:24.575 --> 37:26.076
I'm sorry- I didn't mean to-
I'm nervous-

37:26.244 --> 37:28.536
God damn it- Just take it slow
and calm down now-

37:51.310 --> 37:54.354
We got lucky-

37:54.522 --> 37:56.439
Oh, he's pulling somebody over-

37:59.026 --> 38:00.860
That dude is wasted-

38:01.028 --> 38:03.196
How do people go and drive
in that condition, you know?

38:03.364 --> 38:05.323
It amazes me-

38:05.491 --> 38:08.743
You're awfully self-righteous
sometimes for a bank robber-

38:08.911 --> 38:10.328
Really?

38:10.496 --> 38:12.330
Oh, I didn't know
that in the ground rules

38:12.498 --> 38:14.666
I asked you to comment
on my character-

38:14.834 --> 38:16.209
Sorry-

38:16.377 --> 38:19.129
But I'll let it slide-

38:19.297 --> 38:21.423
It's funny-- it reminds me
of that shrink again-

38:21.590 --> 38:25.427
I mean, he called me
a rigid moralist.

38:25.594 --> 38:27.971
How about that--

38:28.139 --> 38:30.015
a rigid moralist?

38:30.182 --> 38:32.142
Well, if you really want
my opinion,

38:32.310 --> 38:34.602
I mean,

38:34.770 --> 38:38.148
I'd say you have
sociopathic tendencies maybe,

38:38.316 --> 38:40.191
but, um,

38:40.359 --> 38:42.777
I don't really know
what a moralist is, to be honest-

38:42.945 --> 38:46.364
Well, it means that I have
a very strong, strict code

38:46.532 --> 38:47.907
for what's right and wrong-

38:48.075 --> 38:50.702
It means I don't deal
with compromises.

38:50.870 --> 38:53.788
I don't accept them-
I believe what's right is right-

38:53.956 --> 38:56.958
It's funny, you know,
'cause all these people out there--

38:57.126 --> 38:59.377
they think if you're a criminal,

38:59.545 --> 39:01.171
- you don't have any morals-
- Right?

39:01.339 --> 39:03.006
It just isn't true-
it's garbage.

39:03.174 --> 39:05.425
I mean, you look at all these
law-abiding people everywhere

39:05.593 --> 39:08.219
and they don't know morals
from molasses-

39:08.387 --> 39:11.181
And then these peopie--
they think, "Oh, I'm gonna play it safe

39:11.349 --> 39:14.476
and I'm gonna do it this way-"
And that makes them feel righteous-

39:14.643 --> 39:17.145
They're nothing but sheep-

39:19.857 --> 39:22.067
I think I'm a sheep-

39:23.527 --> 39:25.403
What?

39:25.571 --> 39:27.989
You think I'm a sheep?

39:28.157 --> 39:30.283
Um,

39:30.451 --> 39:34.037
No, I think you're a whole other
class of something else-

39:35.581 --> 39:37.332
I think things
got twisted up for you-

39:37.500 --> 39:39.292
You don't know
which way to jump-

39:39.460 --> 39:41.628
That's what I find-

39:42.922 --> 39:45.006
Tell me about your old man-

39:45.174 --> 39:47.384
What's your tale of woe?

39:48.803 --> 39:51.846
No tale- We're divorced-

39:52.014 --> 39:55.934
So you divorced him
and he's not getting any tail, right?

39:57.937 --> 39:59.312
Get that?

39:59.480 --> 40:01.648
- "Tail"-- you see what I did there?
- Yeah, a pun- I get it-

40:01.816 --> 40:03.441
It's funny-

40:06.487 --> 40:08.738
Yeah, it's funny-

40:09.990 --> 40:19.666
Did he ever hit you?

40:21.335 --> 40:22.710
Once-

40:28.717 --> 40:30.927
Well, see, there you go-

40:31.095 --> 40:33.430
You do know right from wrong,

40:33.597 --> 40:35.306
'cause you didn't take it-
You left-

40:35.474 --> 40:38.309
You took your boy
and protected him and yourself-

40:38.477 --> 40:41.479
What else is there?

40:41.647 --> 40:44.441
I think I've taken very good care
of my boy, you know?

40:45.526 --> 40:47.861
Now why would you care
what I think?

40:48.028 --> 40:49.904
I'm a criminal-

40:50.072 --> 40:51.865
That's what I am, right?

40:52.032 --> 40:55.201
You care what a criminal thinks
of your parenting skiiis?

40:55.369 --> 40:57.454
- That's a little crazy-
- Yeah-

41:00.583 --> 41:02.459
This is nice, you know?

41:02.626 --> 41:04.669
It's nice to just be able to have
a conversation with you.

41:04.837 --> 41:06.713
I think the more
you get to know me,

41:06.881 --> 41:09.340
the more we get along-

41:11.010 --> 41:12.886
I think what it all
boils down to

41:13.053 --> 41:15.430
Is I like talking to you-

41:15.598 --> 41:17.849
I haven't had that in a while-

41:19.643 --> 41:22.854
So---

41:23.022 --> 41:25.064
when are you gonna
let us go?

41:26.358 --> 41:29.360
I mean, you're probably gonna
let us go soon, right?

41:29.528 --> 41:30.695
Huh-

41:30.863 --> 41:33.406
Talk about the fickle females-

41:33.574 --> 41:35.325
I mean, here we are-

41:35.493 --> 41:37.660
We've just-- kind ofjust had
a great conversation.

41:37.828 --> 41:39.329
I'm opening up to you-

41:39.497 --> 41:41.831
- I'm feeling kind of vulnerable and--
- No, that's not what I meant.

41:41.999 --> 41:45.084
- That's not--
- Well, Lorraine, you do me right,

41:45.252 --> 41:47.253
and I'll send you
and your boy off

41:47.421 --> 41:49.964
with a smile
and a fond farewell-

41:50.132 --> 41:52.467
But you do me wrong,

41:52.635 --> 41:55.178
and you and little Chaddy

41:55.346 --> 41:57.222
are really fucked-

41:57.389 --> 42:00.225
Are you threatening
my son now?

42:00.392 --> 42:03.019
I'm threatening you
and your son.

43:05.082 --> 43:07.792
- You got your brights on?
- No-

43:09.628 --> 43:11.504
Well, just slow down-

43:11.672 --> 43:14.841
I think there might be
a speed trap up ahead-

43:15.009 --> 43:17.844
Hello- Lorraine-

43:21.223 --> 43:23.641
Hello, crazy woman-
Lorraine-

43:25.102 --> 43:26.936
Don't be a wimp, Lorraine-

43:27.104 --> 43:29.522
Who cares if you have the right
to be angry?

43:29.690 --> 43:32.025
Just be angry, for God's sakes-

43:33.694 --> 43:35.194
Lorraine, I said slow down-

43:37.239 --> 43:39.741
Damn it-

43:45.748 --> 43:47.749
Come on-
Come on, honey-

43:47.916 --> 43:50.001
Come on, come on-

43:50.169 --> 43:52.629
Oh God- Help!

43:52.796 --> 43:54.047
Help!

43:54.214 --> 43:56.591
Lorraine!

43:56.759 --> 43:58.092
Help!

44:00.387 --> 44:02.347
Come here.

44:02.514 --> 44:03.723
- Chad, Chad!
- Get up.

44:03.891 --> 44:06.351
- We're just playing tag, buddy-
- Run! Chad, run!

44:06.518 --> 44:08.394
Get up-

44:08.562 --> 44:10.605
What the fuck
are you trying to do?

44:10.773 --> 44:12.607
Huh? What did we
just talk about?

44:12.775 --> 44:15.193
- Don't hurt my boy.
- What did we just talk about?

44:15.361 --> 44:17.528
- Don't hurt my boy-
- Mommy.

44:17.696 --> 44:19.822
Listen to me-

44:19.990 --> 44:21.824
I thought you maced me
back there-

44:21.992 --> 44:23.826
Is that Binaca?

44:23.994 --> 44:26.204
I didn't even know
they still made that-

44:26.372 --> 44:30.416
Fucking-- I smell like
a fucking candy cane, Lorraine-

44:30.584 --> 44:33.044
Thanks-
Let's get back to the car-

44:33.212 --> 44:35.171
Come on-

44:35.339 --> 44:37.715
Hey, Chad, you're gonna
get in the back, okay?

44:40.094 --> 44:42.387
Mom's up front with me-
I'm gonna drive-

44:42.554 --> 44:44.430
- Okay, go ahead-
- I'llget him.

44:44.598 --> 44:46.474
You get in- You get in-

44:46.642 --> 44:48.768
Your mom's a real pistol, huh?

44:49.978 --> 44:52.230
A real pistol-

44:56.902 --> 44:58.778
Lorraine: It's okay-

44:58.946 --> 45:01.739
Okay okay okay-

45:01.907 --> 45:05.702
- Okay, let's try this again-
- Oh my God. Okay.

45:31.812 --> 45:34.021
So I've got about 250 grand

45:34.189 --> 45:36.023
and another 350
and some change

45:36.191 --> 45:38.025
waiting for me
at the end of this road-

45:38.193 --> 45:39.694
Good for you-

45:39.862 --> 45:41.946
So if I get away with this,
I've got everything to live for-

45:42.114 --> 45:44.157
If I get caught,

45:44.324 --> 45:46.784
I've got nothing to lose-

45:47.786 --> 45:49.787
I have to go to the bathroom-

45:51.331 --> 45:52.915
Can you pull over, please?

45:53.083 --> 45:55.209
No, we were just there.
You should have gone there, bud-

45:55.377 --> 45:57.420
- I'm sorry-
- I have to go-

45:57.588 --> 46:00.590
Please just pull over and I promise
I won't give you any more trouble-

46:00.758 --> 46:03.509
You always say that-
Here, little buddy.

46:03.677 --> 46:04.927
Got a cup-
I've done it before-

46:05.095 --> 46:06.971
No. No no no.
Honey, put on your earphones-

46:07.139 --> 46:09.432
Pay attention to your video game-
We'll stop soon, alright?

46:09.600 --> 46:10.600
You can hold it-

46:10.768 --> 46:12.602
We're not stopping, Lorraine-

46:12.770 --> 46:14.687
I'm betting we are-

46:14.855 --> 46:17.815
Okay, you want to bet?
Let's do it. Ante up.

46:17.983 --> 46:20.985
- What?
- I've got 550, a little more,

46:21.153 --> 46:23.362
saying that we're not stopping-
What have you got?

46:23.530 --> 46:24.947
I don't want your money-

46:25.115 --> 46:28.075
What are you gonna bet, Lorraine?
You've got to put something up.

46:28.243 --> 46:30.286
I have nothing-

46:30.454 --> 46:32.747
That's not necessarily true-

46:37.878 --> 46:39.921
Okay.
Okay, how about this?

46:40.088 --> 46:42.089
If I win, you let us go-

46:42.257 --> 46:44.926
And if I lose,
I won't be any more trouble-

46:45.093 --> 46:47.637
Hmm, that's what
you said before-

46:47.805 --> 46:49.972
You already lied once to me-

46:54.853 --> 46:56.813
And now yourjacket's buzzing-

46:56.980 --> 46:58.856
- What the hell is that, Lorraine?
- I don't--

46:59.024 --> 47:00.900
- Lying to me again.
- I don't know what that is-

47:01.068 --> 47:03.069
- Give me the goddamn phone-
- Stop it-

47:03.237 --> 47:05.071
Who's calling?

47:05.239 --> 47:06.614
- Who is it?
- Gary.

47:06.782 --> 47:09.033
- Gary? Who's that?
- My-- my ex-husband-

47:10.911 --> 47:12.495
- Hello-
- Give me the phone-

47:12.663 --> 47:13.871
Hey- Gary?

47:14.039 --> 47:17.542
Well, yeah- Hey- How are you?
This is John.

47:17.709 --> 47:20.670
Yeah, Lorraine's here,
but she's a bit tied up right now-

47:20.838 --> 47:23.631
I've got a question for you:
is it true you've got this

47:23.799 --> 47:25.675
little pee-pee the size
of a baby gherkin?

47:25.843 --> 47:27.885
'Cause Lorraine told me you did-

47:28.053 --> 47:29.971
And unfortunately
I was thinking about that-

47:30.138 --> 47:32.139
Being a divorced man and all,
and you're going out,

47:32.307 --> 47:34.684
probably trying
to meet some ladies-

47:34.852 --> 47:36.978
Uh-huh.
Well, that's--

47:37.145 --> 47:40.022
that's kind of insulting,
since we've never met-

47:40.190 --> 47:42.149
Why don't you listen to this, Gary?

47:42.317 --> 47:45.278
This is the sound of you
being tossed out on your ass-

47:45.445 --> 47:48.072
Why did you do that?

47:51.869 --> 47:55.162
All right, bud, you can go
take a leak now if you want-

47:55.330 --> 47:58.666
It's okay, hon- Just stay right outside
the door, okay, so Mom can see you-

47:58.834 --> 48:01.168
Yeah, be safe-
Just stay right close to the car, okay?

48:01.336 --> 48:03.504
Me and your mom are right here-
Good boy-

48:03.672 --> 48:05.131
Yeah, just right there-

48:05.299 --> 48:06.966
Listen to me.
I want some answers

48:07.134 --> 48:09.343
and I want some fucking answers
right now.

48:09.511 --> 48:11.804
You had a phone in that bathroom-

48:11.972 --> 48:13.764
You were at the gas station-
Did you make a call?

48:13.932 --> 48:16.517
- Did you make a phone call?
- Yes- Yes, I did-

48:16.685 --> 48:18.728
Who did you call? Gary?
That fucking prick?

48:18.896 --> 48:21.063
- No.
- Who? You call 911 , the police?

48:21.231 --> 48:22.523
No-

48:22.691 --> 48:25.776
So who'd you call, Lorraine?
I'm not fucking around anymore-

48:25.944 --> 48:28.905
I tried to call 911 ,

48:29.072 --> 48:31.407
- but I didn't- Instead--
- Don't lie to me-

48:31.575 --> 48:35.286
I am not lying, I swear.
I promise you that I called 411 -

48:35.454 --> 48:37.997
And the operator-- she asked me
what city I was in

48:38.165 --> 48:40.124
and I didn't understand
what she was asking me

48:40.292 --> 48:42.251
and I got confused-

48:42.419 --> 48:45.796
I tried to call 911 -
It didn't work-

48:45.964 --> 48:48.716
So you're telling me
you called 411

48:48.884 --> 48:50.509
- Instead of 911 -
- Yep-

48:50.677 --> 48:53.095
And then you're telling me
that you forgot to turn your phone off-

48:53.263 --> 48:55.848
- Yep-
- Well, you're a fucking train wreck-

48:57.184 --> 48:59.101
Maybe you don't want me
to let you go.

49:00.103 --> 49:02.188
- You must really like me-
- I'm done.

49:02.356 --> 49:03.981
Hey, bud, come on back in-

49:04.149 --> 49:07.026
Come on, hon-
Come back in- Come on-

49:07.194 --> 49:08.486
You feel better?

49:08.654 --> 49:11.906
- That's my boy.
- All right, let's keep going here-

49:12.074 --> 49:14.659
Okay, baby, why don't you
lie down and get some rest?

49:14.826 --> 49:16.953
Okay, Mommy-

50:03.208 --> 50:06.043
Are you into politics, Lorraine?

50:06.211 --> 50:08.379
Like which way do you vote?

50:09.965 --> 50:12.008
I don't know-

50:12.175 --> 50:14.927
I voted the way
Gary wanted me to-

50:16.304 --> 50:19.056
Well, that's silly.
You don't have your own opinions?

50:19.224 --> 50:22.768
I wouldn't let you do that.
I'd want you to do what you want to do-

50:26.106 --> 50:28.065
You know what?
You're right-

50:28.233 --> 50:30.359
I need to be more in control-

50:30.527 --> 50:33.195
I'm gonna make some changes
when I get home, I'm telling you-

50:34.865 --> 50:36.907
Roy: Well, if everything
goes to pian for me,

50:37.075 --> 50:39.076
I'd like to make
some changes too-

50:39.244 --> 50:41.078
You should, you know-

50:41.246 --> 50:43.706
Settle down.
Find someone to settle down with-

50:43.874 --> 50:46.959
Get yourself a nice wife

50:47.127 --> 50:49.670
and a boy of your own-

50:49.838 --> 50:51.172
Is that an invitation?

50:54.134 --> 50:56.385
I'd love to have my own family-

50:56.553 --> 51:00.181
I'd love to have a little boy
like Chaddy back there.

51:01.224 --> 51:03.726
Yeah, I want three girls too-

51:03.894 --> 51:06.687
Man, if I had
three little daughters,

51:06.855 --> 51:09.815
I would protect them so much,
they'd never have a worry in the world-

51:09.983 --> 51:12.693
I'd raise my boy
to be real strong

51:12.861 --> 51:15.821
so after I'm gone
he'd look after them-

51:21.745 --> 51:23.621
You ever been to Mexico?

51:23.789 --> 51:26.082
Tijuana once-

51:26.249 --> 51:28.292
That's a shit hole-

51:28.460 --> 51:30.753
No, I'm talking the real Mexico,

51:30.921 --> 51:33.005
up in the mountains-- pueblos-

51:33.173 --> 51:35.841
I mean, it's cool- It's dry-
The air is crisp-

51:36.009 --> 51:37.885
I always wanted to go
to a pueblo.

51:38.053 --> 51:40.721
You know, in fourth grade you build
those sort of clay models.

51:40.889 --> 51:44.266
And I used to pretend I was one of
the guys in there and I lived there.

51:44.434 --> 51:46.435
And the people are so great
in the pueblos.

51:46.603 --> 51:50.689
I mean, it's the opposite of
what we were talking about earlier-

51:50.857 --> 51:53.442
And talk about living--
I mean, a man with a little money--

51:53.610 --> 51:56.821
we'd own that town.
I mean, we'd have a big house,

51:56.988 --> 52:00.491
hunt and fish
and drink tequila every day-

52:00.659 --> 52:04.411
Come wintertime, we could also
drive down to Cabo San Lucas

52:04.579 --> 52:06.831
and get a big villa on the beach,

52:06.998 --> 52:08.624
even have servants-

52:08.792 --> 52:11.210
Wouldn't that be something?

52:12.879 --> 52:14.171
Yeah-

52:14.339 --> 52:16.173
And you don't have to worry
about the language,

52:16.341 --> 52:19.009
'cause most people
speak Engiish.

52:19.177 --> 52:20.970
Oh really?

52:21.138 --> 52:24.014
I actually aiways wanted
to learn how to speak Spanish-

52:24.182 --> 52:26.225
I always wanted to travel too,

52:26.393 --> 52:28.352
but then, I don't know,

52:28.520 --> 52:31.105
I guess I got married too young-

52:31.273 --> 52:33.983
I was even gonna go to college,
but my dad said

52:34.151 --> 52:36.819
I was too dumb and too pretty-

52:39.281 --> 52:41.740
Are you really going to Mexico?

52:41.908 --> 52:43.868
You're not getting it-

52:44.035 --> 52:46.579
We're going to Mexico-

52:52.377 --> 52:55.171
I--

52:55.338 --> 52:58.048
We're going to Mexico,
Lorraine-

52:58.216 --> 52:59.300
I can't-

52:59.467 --> 53:02.011
Roy, this is crazy.
I can't go to Mexico-

53:02.179 --> 53:03.929
I can't take Chad there-

53:04.097 --> 53:06.015
I mean, we have a whole life here
and he's just--

53:06.183 --> 53:07.850
Right, yeah, a big life--

53:08.018 --> 53:10.019
you, Chad and all those
frozen mini-pizzas-

53:10.187 --> 53:13.772
I'm trying to give you
a way out, Lorraine-

53:15.525 --> 53:17.443
What's going on with the car,
Lorraine?

53:17.611 --> 53:19.195
- Oh God-
- Hold on.

53:19.362 --> 53:21.655
- Oh God, oh God, oh God-
- Let me pull over- Hold up-

53:26.244 --> 53:27.995
We've got to stop for gas-

53:28.163 --> 53:30.247
- We have half a tank-
- No. I know.

53:30.415 --> 53:32.958
There's water in the tank-

53:33.126 --> 53:35.127
I mean, it's run out,

53:35.295 --> 53:37.796
but when it goes--

53:37.964 --> 53:39.840
the gauge goes down to half,
it means--

53:40.008 --> 53:42.718
it starts to sputter and then

53:42.886 --> 53:46.263
we have to stop for more gas-

53:46.431 --> 53:48.140
It's a pain in the ass, I know-

53:48.308 --> 53:51.060
So why didn't you
just get it fixed, Lorraine?

53:53.980 --> 53:56.232
You're pathetic-

53:58.693 --> 54:00.527
Okay-

54:10.080 --> 54:12.748
What the hell are there so many kids
out here for, Lorraine?

54:12.916 --> 54:14.333
It's nighttime-

54:14.501 --> 54:17.211
Maybe it's a field trip-

54:18.421 --> 54:20.381
Stay in the car-

55:04.968 --> 55:07.052
Hey, bud, come here-

55:07.220 --> 55:11.307
- It's time to go to the bathroom, okay?
- I already went-

55:11.474 --> 55:13.142
I know, but you're
gonna go again-

55:13.310 --> 55:15.853
Now you listen to Mommy and promise
you're gonna do what I say.

55:16.021 --> 55:19.148
- Okay, Mommy-
- Okay.

55:39.210 --> 55:40.210
Get in the car, Lorraine-

55:40.378 --> 55:43.213
Chad has to go to the bathroom-

55:45.258 --> 55:48.302
Hey, buddy, come on out-

55:55.226 --> 55:57.394
You gotta go to the bathroom
again, huh?

55:57.562 --> 55:59.438
You got some bladder on you-

55:59.606 --> 56:02.441
You go straight there
and you come right back, okay?

56:02.609 --> 56:04.568
Mm-hmm-

56:04.736 --> 56:07.154
Your mom's gonna wait here-

56:09.741 --> 56:12.368
Go for it-

56:19.751 --> 56:22.211
Why don't you get in the car,
Lorraine?

56:36.309 --> 56:39.144
Do you want my balloon?

56:39.312 --> 56:41.980
Come on, man, don't talk to her-
Just go to the men's room.

56:42.148 --> 56:44.024
You can have it-

56:44.192 --> 56:47.528
You don't need that balloon.
We've got to get moving soon-

56:51.491 --> 56:52.908
There you go-

57:58.475 --> 57:59.641
Motherfucker-

58:32.592 --> 58:34.801
I know you're mad-

58:34.969 --> 58:37.971
I'm-- I'm sorry, Roy-

58:38.139 --> 58:41.517
Look, I promise
it's not what you think-

58:41.684 --> 58:45.687
Okay? Gary doesn't
give a crap about me, you know,

58:45.855 --> 58:47.731
but he really cares about Chad-

58:47.899 --> 58:50.984
If he was with us, he'd have
every cop in the country after us-

58:51.152 --> 58:53.862
Fuck you, Lorraine!
I'm sick of your goddamn lies!

58:54.030 --> 58:55.697
I'm not lying-
I didn't do it.

58:55.865 --> 58:57.824
- You know what? Fuck you-
- I am not lying-

58:57.992 --> 58:59.576
You've been fucking with me
from the beginning.

58:59.744 --> 59:01.411
- No, I haven't.
- I told you what you needed to do-

59:01.579 --> 59:03.872
- I just wanted my son to be safe, okay?
- Be a good girl

59:04.040 --> 59:06.583
and I would have kept you and him safe-
You know what?

59:06.751 --> 59:10.504
No more Mr- Nice Guy, okay?

59:10.672 --> 59:11.964
- Come on-
- No. No.

59:12.131 --> 59:13.882
Come on, Lorraine-
You don't trust me, huh?

59:14.050 --> 59:16.051
- You're going in the fucking trunk-
- Listen to me.

59:16.219 --> 59:18.095
You're going in the trunk.
You're going in the fucking trunk-

59:18.263 --> 59:19.930
- I didn't want my boy to get hurt-
- That's it-

59:20.098 --> 59:22.432
No. No.

59:22.600 --> 59:24.476
Little bitch-

59:24.644 --> 59:26.853
Roy! Roy!

59:27.021 --> 59:29.565
You fuck with me?

59:33.278 --> 59:34.444
Everything was fine-

59:34.612 --> 59:37.739
Everything was fucking fine,
Lorraine.

59:49.252 --> 59:50.586
How's the trunk
back there, honey?

59:53.965 --> 59:55.841
You could have been nice
and cozy up here with me-

59:59.387 --> 01:00:02.014
I fucking warned you-
I warned you, honey.

01:00:10.648 --> 01:00:14.109
Yeah, keep banging-
Keep banging-

01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:17.529
You bang your car all you want,
you fucking bitch.

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.116
You just pushed me-
She just--

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:24.828
I mean, who are these fucking people?
I just picked the wrong two people-

01:00:40.595 --> 01:00:43.680
You make all the noise you want,
Lorraine- I can't hear you, all right?

01:00:53.691 --> 01:00:56.276
Ow-

01:01:02.825 --> 01:01:04.743
You had to fuck it up-

01:01:04.911 --> 01:01:06.662
Jesus Christ-

01:01:19.801 --> 01:01:21.802
Come on, buddy-
Let's get you home-

01:01:47.745 --> 01:01:51.498
There it is-
There it is-

01:02:43.134 --> 01:02:45.886
What the fuck, man?
What are you doing?

01:02:46.053 --> 01:02:48.221
I thought I had the wrong house-

01:02:48.389 --> 01:02:51.141
Taking a crap, man,
you know.

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:54.686
What I've been through
getting to this fucking place-

01:02:54.854 --> 01:02:56.646
Jesus Christ-

01:02:56.814 --> 01:02:59.691
Tell me what happened with the money?
Why did you go to the steel mill?

01:02:59.859 --> 01:03:01.943
I mean, it's kind of like home-
You know, it's empty-

01:03:02.111 --> 01:03:04.863
Freaking cops everywhere--
what do you want me to do?

01:03:05.865 --> 01:03:08.366
What, man?

01:03:08.534 --> 01:03:10.410
Are you stoned?

01:03:10.578 --> 01:03:12.204
I'm not stoned, man-
No, not at all.

01:03:12.371 --> 01:03:14.831
You're wasted, huh?

01:03:14.999 --> 01:03:16.625
I am not wasted-

01:03:16.793 --> 01:03:19.002
Got too much to do tonight-

01:03:21.422 --> 01:03:23.965
All right-

01:03:35.978 --> 01:03:39.940
Oh- Oh God-

01:03:46.864 --> 01:03:49.658
Don't hit him, Lorraine-
He's already dead.

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:52.327
No! Roy!

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:54.287
- I wanted you to have some company-
- No!

01:03:54.455 --> 01:03:56.998
No-o-o!

01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:02.045
Roy!

01:04:02.213 --> 01:04:04.756
Roy, no!

01:04:04.924 --> 01:04:06.299
No-

01:04:06.467 --> 01:04:08.718
Please-

01:04:08.886 --> 01:04:11.054
Please, Roy-

01:04:15.101 --> 01:04:17.435
Roy, please-

01:04:17.603 --> 01:04:20.063
Let me out- Roy-

01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:02.123
Excuse me, do you have
a phone, please?

01:06:18.599 --> 01:06:20.475
- What city?
- Whitfield County-

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:24.521
I'm looking for the Whitfield County
School District headquarters, please-

01:06:24.689 --> 01:06:26.564
One moment-

01:06:26.732 --> 01:06:28.733
Okay, do you have a pen?

01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:31.945
- The phone number is---
- Go ahead-

01:06:32.113 --> 01:06:35.490
601-555-2895-

01:06:35.658 --> 01:06:37.200
Thank you-

01:06:44.792 --> 01:06:47.168
Please deposit 50c-

01:06:56.137 --> 01:06:58.096
I'm sorry-
I hate to bother you again,

01:06:58.264 --> 01:06:59.597
but I'm having a little trouble-

01:06:59.765 --> 01:07:01.474
Can you please give me
50c for a phone call?

01:07:01.642 --> 01:07:03.518
I can't give you change
unless you buy something-

01:07:03.686 --> 01:07:04.936
Buy something?
You don't understand-

01:07:05.104 --> 01:07:06.855
I don't have any money-
I don't want change.

01:07:07.023 --> 01:07:09.274
You said you needed change
for the phone.

01:07:09.442 --> 01:07:12.068
Yes, I want 50c-

01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:17.073
Okay, fine-

01:07:17.241 --> 01:07:20.910
Here, 35c, okay?

01:07:21.078 --> 01:07:24.330
If you can spare it, I need to make
a phone call. it's an emergency.

01:07:24.498 --> 01:07:27.250
What kind of emergency?
It don't cost nothing to dial 911 -

01:07:27.418 --> 01:07:28.918
Jesus Christ-

01:07:29.086 --> 01:07:31.755
Whoa whoa, you don't need
to take the Lord's name in vain-

01:07:31.922 --> 01:07:34.257
- Here's your 50c-
- Thank you.

01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:37.218
Have a blessed day-

01:07:46.854 --> 01:07:48.938
Whitfield School District-
May I help you?

01:07:49.106 --> 01:07:51.900
Yes, I'm trying to find my son.
He got on one of your buses by mistake-

01:07:52.068 --> 01:07:53.902
Which school
does he attend, ma'am?

01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:56.696
No, he doesn't
go to school- He's--

01:07:56.864 --> 01:07:58.740
I'm sorry-
He's not one of our students?

01:07:58.908 --> 01:08:01.910
No no no-
Listen, it's hard to explain-

01:08:02.078 --> 01:08:04.079
One of your buses
was at a truck stop

01:08:04.246 --> 01:08:07.832
on Highway 61
early this morning-

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.042
There were a bunch of kids-

01:08:09.210 --> 01:08:11.461
I think they were on
a field trip or something-

01:08:11.629 --> 01:08:13.296
Okay, did you get
the bus number, ma'am?

01:08:13.464 --> 01:08:14.964
No, I didn't get
the bus number-

01:08:15.132 --> 01:08:17.884
Jesus, how many buses
do you have out that time of day?

01:08:28.145 --> 01:08:29.979
I just started my shift
15 minutes ago.

01:08:30.147 --> 01:08:32.482
I'm so sorry- I'm upset-
I lost my kid-

01:08:32.649 --> 01:08:34.109
I don't know what to do-

01:08:34.276 --> 01:08:36.903
I'm sorry, ma'am-
What was his name again?

01:08:37.071 --> 01:08:39.363
His name is Chad-

01:08:41.158 --> 01:08:42.867
One moment, please-

01:08:46.287 --> 01:08:49.374
- Ma'am, are you still there?
- Yes. Yes, I'm still here.

01:08:49.542 --> 01:08:51.542
Did you say Chad?

01:08:51.710 --> 01:08:52.961
Yes-

01:08:53.129 --> 01:08:54.796
Seven years old, light hair?

01:08:54.964 --> 01:08:57.173
Yes yes.
You have him?

01:08:57.341 --> 01:08:58.716
- Ma'am-
- Is he all right?

01:08:58.884 --> 01:09:00.844
- Yes, ma'am, he's fine.
- Oh, thank God- Thank God-

01:09:01.011 --> 01:09:03.304
We turned him over to the Whitfield
Country Sheriff's Department.

01:09:03.471 --> 01:09:05.055
Would you like
that number so you can call?

01:09:05.224 --> 01:09:06.640
Yes, thank you-

01:09:10.563 --> 01:09:12.939
- Thank you-
- Thanks.

01:09:15.943 --> 01:09:18.569
I need another 50c-

01:09:45.555 --> 01:09:48.183
Yes, hello.
I'm trying to find my son-

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:50.393
His name is Chad-
This is his mom-

01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:54.898
Hello hello-

01:09:55.065 --> 01:09:57.775
You got anything to eat
around here?

01:09:57.943 --> 01:10:00.778
Honey, when are you gonna let me
take a picture of you?

01:10:00.946 --> 01:10:02.113
Why?

01:10:02.281 --> 01:10:05.283
'Cause I want Santa to know exactly
what I want for Christmas-

01:10:05.451 --> 01:10:07.035
Now why would I want
to be with you?

01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:09.120
'Cause I'm funny,
financially stable

01:10:09.288 --> 01:10:12.165
and I've got a very interesting
DNA structure.

01:10:14.293 --> 01:10:17.212
I'll get you a seat- Take your coat off-
You iook like an Eskimo.

01:10:17.379 --> 01:10:19.214
Well, it's cold in here
because of you, baby-

01:10:19.381 --> 01:10:20.465
Oh Jeez-

01:10:20.633 --> 01:10:23.676
- Hey hey, take these-
- Lord, are you trying to kill me?

01:10:23.844 --> 01:10:26.095
Maybe, if you don't
give me some-

01:10:28.057 --> 01:10:29.933
How's everybody doing?

01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:32.268
Yes, hello.
I'm trying to find my son-

01:10:48.869 --> 01:10:50.119
Hi, Mommy-

01:10:50.287 --> 01:10:52.664
Hi, honey-
Is that you?

01:10:52.831 --> 01:10:54.082
Are you all right?

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:58.294
Uh-huh- But man,
that was a long bus ride-

01:10:58.462 --> 01:11:00.880
it's so good to hear
your voice, sweetie-

01:11:01.048 --> 01:11:03.132
Mommy's gonna
pick you up soon, okay?

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:05.635
- I love you so much-
- I love you too, Mommy-

01:11:05.803 --> 01:11:08.054
Put the deputy back
on the phone now, okay?

01:11:08.222 --> 01:11:09.347
Okay-

01:11:13.435 --> 01:11:15.144
Ma'am, this is
Detective Walsh again-

01:11:15.312 --> 01:11:18.022
If you give me a location,
we'll send a car to pick you up-

01:11:18.190 --> 01:11:21.192
Yes, hold on-
Excuse me-

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:22.860
Excuse me.
Where are we, please?

01:11:23.028 --> 01:11:26.030
Imperial Diner and Truck Stop,
Highway 61 ,

01:11:26.198 --> 01:11:28.116
just north of the I-20 junction-

01:11:28.284 --> 01:11:31.286
We're at the Imperial Diner
Truck Stop, Highway 61 ,

01:11:31.453 --> 01:11:33.329
just north of the I-20 junction-

01:11:33.497 --> 01:11:35.456
Okay, and can you give me
a name and a description

01:11:35.624 --> 01:11:37.583
of the man you say attacked you?

01:11:37.751 --> 01:11:41.045
Okay, his name is Roy-
He di-- I don't know his last name-

01:11:41.213 --> 01:11:43.339
He was about 5'10", I guess,

01:11:43.507 --> 01:11:46.050
medium build, brownish eyes,

01:11:46.218 --> 01:11:48.177
shaggy brown hair

01:11:48.345 --> 01:11:50.930
and dirty jeans,
sweatshirt.

01:11:51.098 --> 01:11:53.725
Ma'am, there's one other thing-
Because of your record--

01:11:53.892 --> 01:11:55.184
- My record?
- Yes, ma'am-

01:11:55.352 --> 01:11:57.270
The recent complaint
filed by your husband-

01:11:57.438 --> 01:12:00.148
- My ex-husband-
- Yes, ma'am.

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:03.484
We'll have to turn your son over to
the Department of Children's Services-

01:12:03.652 --> 01:12:05.528
What? We were carjacked-

01:12:05.696 --> 01:12:08.614
Well, I understand, ma'am,
but when a child is abandoned like that,

01:12:08.782 --> 01:12:10.825
the state feels
it has to investigate-

01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:12.660
Excuse me, the state felt?

01:12:12.828 --> 01:12:15.288
How about how I felt?
I thought he was going to kill us-

01:12:15.456 --> 01:12:17.498
I'm sorry, ma'am.
The report's already been filed-

01:12:17.666 --> 01:12:20.251
I did not abandon my child-
Do you hear me?

01:12:20.419 --> 01:12:21.502
You have no right
to say that.

01:12:21.670 --> 01:12:25.173
I did what I had to do
to protect him from that lunatic-

01:12:28.552 --> 01:12:31.721
Oh my God, he's right outside- He has
a woman and a little girl with him-

01:12:31.889 --> 01:12:34.474
I didn't get that, ma'am-
Could you repeat, please?

01:12:34.641 --> 01:12:37.477
He's here-
The carjacker-- he's right outside-

01:12:37.644 --> 01:12:40.521
- Are you sure it's the same man?
- Yes, of course I'm sure!

01:12:40.689 --> 01:12:44.442
Okay, you just stay caim.
We've got a car on the way, okay?

01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:48.196
It's too late- He's getting in a car-
He's getting away-

01:12:48.364 --> 01:12:50.990
Is it a Chevrolet or a Ford?
What kind of car is it?

01:12:51.158 --> 01:12:54.243
Which way is it headed?
Ma'am, are you there?

01:12:54.411 --> 01:12:57.205
- South.
- Can you describe the car, ma'am?

01:12:57.373 --> 01:12:59.874
- It's-- it's a car-
- Ma'am, just calm down-

01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:04.045
It's being followed
by a beat-up green Bronco-

01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:05.963
Damn!

01:13:15.599 --> 01:13:17.600
Hello, peaches-

01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:38.246
Bitch, what are you doing?
Psycho!

01:13:38.414 --> 01:13:41.082
Psycho bitch!

01:13:45.462 --> 01:13:46.421
Shit-

01:14:00.436 --> 01:14:03.938
- What's your name?
- Kristen-

01:14:05.357 --> 01:14:08.276
Kristen, I'll let you go
as soon as I get to where I gotta go-

01:14:08.444 --> 01:14:12.113
We don't have much further-

01:14:37.598 --> 01:14:39.765
All right, should be
another coupie of exits

01:14:39.933 --> 01:14:42.602
and we'll be there finally-

01:15:13.467 --> 01:15:15.843
- So how old are you, little girl?
- It doesn't matter.

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:33.694
You want to tailgate me or you want
to pass me? What are you doing?

01:15:44.998 --> 01:15:46.374
Shut up-

01:15:50.546 --> 01:15:52.421
God damn it-
What the fuck?

01:15:53.757 --> 01:15:55.925
Shut up.

01:16:04.685 --> 01:16:07.353
Let them go, Roy, now!

01:16:11.024 --> 01:16:12.900
You point a gun at me--
I point a gun at you-

01:16:13.068 --> 01:16:14.569
Shut up, God damn it-

01:16:17.322 --> 01:16:19.156
Don't point that fucking gun
at me, Lorraine-

01:16:19.324 --> 01:16:22.368
I'm gonna blow
your fucking head off!

01:16:57.613 --> 01:16:59.614
Oh God-

01:17:19.301 --> 01:17:21.427
Lorraine-

01:17:21.595 --> 01:17:23.596
Let's go get that money-

01:17:23.764 --> 01:17:24.639
What money?

01:17:24.806 --> 01:17:27.600
The money at the sugar mill!

01:17:27.768 --> 01:17:30.686
Lorraine, let me explain, all right?
Maybe if you just listen to me-

01:17:30.854 --> 01:17:32.271
Argh!

01:17:33.273 --> 01:17:35.399
- God damn it-
- Forgive my outburst,

01:17:35.567 --> 01:17:37.693
but I have a problem
dealing with ambiguity-

01:17:37.861 --> 01:17:41.781
That means no maybes, shoulds
or I-think-sos-

01:17:41.948 --> 01:17:43.115
Get it?

01:17:43.283 --> 01:17:45.701
- Do you?
- Yes!

01:17:45.869 --> 01:17:47.745
Now get in the fucking car-

01:17:47.913 --> 01:17:49.580
All right-

01:17:59.174 --> 01:18:01.175
It's good to get angry, Roy-

01:18:01.343 --> 01:18:02.927
Drive!

01:18:33.834 --> 01:18:35.835
Get out-

01:18:38.255 --> 01:18:40.798
Where's the money?

01:18:40.966 --> 01:18:42.383
This way-

01:18:51.852 --> 01:18:53.561
Relax-

01:19:00.026 --> 01:19:02.737
You want to fuck with me?
Is that what you want to do?

01:19:02.904 --> 01:19:04.572
Fuck you-

01:19:27.471 --> 01:19:29.013
Yes-

01:20:14.935 --> 01:20:16.894
I want my fucking money-

01:20:19.064 --> 01:20:20.689
You've got to be
fucking kidding me-

01:20:20.857 --> 01:20:23.651
Stop, Roy-
Just stop-

01:20:28.615 --> 01:20:31.826
What are you gonna do, Lorraine?
Are you gonna run me over, honey?

01:20:33.453 --> 01:20:34.787
Give me my fucking money!

01:20:34.955 --> 01:20:37.498
Come and get it-

01:20:41.711 --> 01:20:42.920
Fuck-

01:21:08.071 --> 01:21:11.240
Show me your hands!

01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:17.913
Get out of the car-

01:21:22.878 --> 01:21:24.420
What happened?

01:21:24.588 --> 01:21:27.214
There was-- there was a man-

01:21:29.801 --> 01:21:31.427
Shots fired.
Requesting immediate--

01:21:41.688 --> 01:21:43.564
Roy, let's stop this, okay?

01:21:43.732 --> 01:21:45.774
You want to keep playing
with me, huh?

01:21:45.942 --> 01:21:48.235
- Is that what you want?
- No.

01:21:48.403 --> 01:21:49.904
No-

01:21:50.071 --> 01:21:53.282
What are you looking at, huh?

01:21:53.450 --> 01:21:55.784
Are you looking at his gun?

01:21:56.953 --> 01:21:59.705
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna go for it?

01:21:59.873 --> 01:22:03.334
Why don't you try?
You're not that far.

01:22:03.501 --> 01:22:05.753
Look, I'll make it
easier for you-

01:22:10.842 --> 01:22:12.885
Did that feel good?

01:22:13.053 --> 01:22:16.889
Now you're even closer, aren't you?

01:22:17.057 --> 01:22:19.850
What, are you a foot,
maybe two feet away?

01:22:20.018 --> 01:22:22.061
You can make that-

01:22:22.228 --> 01:22:23.812
Come on, honey, you can do it-

01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:25.356
You can make that-

01:22:27.025 --> 01:22:29.985
You know what?
Fuck it-

01:23:01.351 --> 01:23:03.894
I guess Mexico is out, huh?

01:23:29.421 --> 01:23:33.966
On the matter of
the custody of Chad,

01:23:34.134 --> 01:23:38.095
I find that Mr. Burton has not shown
any convincing evidence

01:23:38.263 --> 01:23:40.806
as to the child neglect
on the part of Mrs. Burton-

01:23:40.974 --> 01:23:43.392
- Therefore she will retain custody-
- But Your Honor, you don't--

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:47.104
And frankly, Mr. Burton,
considering your recent legal troubles,

01:23:47.272 --> 01:23:50.274
I am amazed
that you had the chutzpah

01:23:50.442 --> 01:23:52.317
to even bring these charges-

01:23:52.485 --> 01:23:55.154
But I must commend you
on getting a good job

01:23:55.321 --> 01:23:57.823
so soon after your
court martial-

01:23:57.991 --> 01:24:00.784
And you can share your good fortune
by paying Mrs. Burton

01:24:00.952 --> 01:24:02.453
$400 a month in child support-

01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:05.289
$400? She just got
a $20,000 reward

01:24:05.457 --> 01:24:07.833
for that bank robber
she supposedly caught-

01:24:08.001 --> 01:24:09.668
She ought to be paying me-

01:24:11.212 --> 01:24:13.922
I can make it $500 if you like-

01:24:16.509 --> 01:24:20.012
Is there anything
you'd like to add, Mrs. Burton?

01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:22.306
Yes- Thank you, Your Honor-

01:24:22.474 --> 01:24:25.392
I'll be going by my maiden name now--
Miss Serrano-

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:29.146
Right you are,
Miss Serrano.

01:24:29.314 --> 01:24:30.647
Good luck to you-

01:24:30.815 --> 01:24:33.067
Court is adjourned-

01:24:33.234 --> 01:24:34.276
Mommy!

01:24:36.613 --> 01:24:39.114
Hi, buddy- Hi-

01:24:39.282 --> 01:24:41.075
Love you so much-

01:24:41.242 --> 01:24:44.495
- Oh, be careful-
- Who's ready for some pizza?

01:24:44.662 --> 01:24:46.538
Hey, Mom-

01:24:46.706 --> 01:24:48.499
Can it be real pizza?

01:24:48.666 --> 01:24:52.086
Oh, I think you can have
all the real pizza you want-

01:24:52.253 --> 01:24:53.921
Why do you say that?

01:24:54.089 --> 01:24:55.964
I dropped one of my
earrings down

01:24:56.132 --> 01:24:58.300
near the end of your bed
this morning.

01:24:58.468 --> 01:25:00.594
It would have rolled
right underneath

01:25:00.762 --> 01:25:02.971
If that big duffle bag
hadn't been there-

01:25:06.267 --> 01:25:07.893
What about ice cream?

01:25:08.061 --> 01:25:10.687
You want ice cream
instead of pizza?

01:25:10.855 --> 01:25:12.815
No, ice cream and pizza-

01:25:12.982 --> 01:25:15.359
- How about ice cream pizza?
- And root beer.
