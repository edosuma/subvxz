*

00:14.880 --> 00:16.177
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:16.210 --> 00:17.199
- MY BOOK REPORT.

00:17.250 --> 00:18.399
- WELL, HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

00:18.450 --> 00:20.577
DIDN'T YOU JUST START THIS
BOOK, LIKE, A HALF AN HOUR AGO?

00:20.620 --> 00:23.282
- YEAH, I READ THE FLAP
AND THEN THE FIRST CHAPTER,

00:23.320 --> 00:25.845
THEN I TOTALLY FIGURED
OUT THE ENDING, SO IT'S COOL.

00:25.890 --> 00:27.312
- WELL, HOW DO YOU KNOW
THAT YOU'RE RIGHT?

00:27.360 --> 00:30.056
- BECAUSE YOU TAUGHT ME
HOW TO DRAW CONCLUSIONS.

00:30.090 --> 00:32.229
- SHAWN, YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DOING, DON'T YOU?

00:32.260 --> 00:34.751
- YEP. BANKING A WHOLE
AFTERNOON OF VIDEO GAME TIME.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.062
- NO.

00:36.100 --> 00:37.419
YOU'RE OPERATING
ON INCOMPLETE INFORMATION.

00:37.470 --> 00:38.892
IT'S SLOPPY, AND ONE DAY,

00:38.930 --> 00:40.431
YOU'RE GONNA FIND YOURSELF
EMBARRASSED BY IT.

00:40.470 --> 00:42.267
- DAD, PLEASE,
IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS

00:42.310 --> 00:43.800
TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

00:43.840 --> 00:45.728
WILBUR'S GONNA WIN
THE PIG RIBBON,

00:45.770 --> 00:48.705
AND HE AND CHARLOTTE ARE GONNA
LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

00:50.550 --> 00:53.713
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

00:53.750 --> 00:56.310
IF YOU GET AN "A"
ON THAT REPORT,

00:56.350 --> 00:58.318
I'M GONNA TAKE YOU
TO DISNEYLAND.

00:58.350 --> 00:59.715
- SWEET!

01:01.420 --> 01:02.580
- GOOD LUCK, KIDDO.

01:11.030 --> 01:14.158
- YOU WERE DOING EXACTLY
WHAT I AM DOING NOW

01:14.200 --> 01:16.304
WHEN YOU POISONED...

01:16.340 --> 01:18.638
MR. CAMFINI'S PIZZA.

01:18.670 --> 01:21.309
THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT
ON THIS PIZZA.

01:21.340 --> 01:22.500
IT'S THE LAST ONE
YOU'LL EAT

01:22.550 --> 01:24.848
BEFORE YOU GO
TO PRISON...FOR MURDER.

01:28.450 --> 01:30.008
I COULD ALSO DO
A CALZONE.

01:30.050 --> 01:31.608
IT'S THE SAME BASIC
PRINCIPLE, RIGHT?

01:31.650 --> 01:32.810
WHERE'S THE PINEAPPLE?

01:32.860 --> 01:34.350
YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE
ANY PINEAPPLE?

01:34.390 --> 01:35.687
- SHAWN, SHAWN.
- DAD?

01:35.720 --> 01:37.529
- [whispering]
YOU GO'I'I'A STOP.

01:37.560 --> 01:39.198
- I'VE MADE A PIZZA BEFORE.
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

01:39.230 --> 01:40.822
- SHAWN, YOU'VE GOT
THE WRONG GUY.

01:40.860 --> 01:42.088
HE'S THE ONLY ONE
IN THE WORLD

01:42.130 --> 01:43.324
WHO COULDN'T POSSIBLY
HAVE DONE THIS.

01:43.370 --> 01:44.723
DIDN'T YOU EVER
READ THE CASE FILE?

01:44.770 --> 01:45.896
- YEAH, I READ TH--

01:45.930 --> 01:47.534
WENT OVER THE SUMMARY
AND PART OF THE FIRST--

01:47.570 --> 01:49.333
I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO READ CASE FILES, OKAY?

01:49.370 --> 01:51.167
- SHAWN,
MEDICAL ALERT BRACELET.

01:51.210 --> 01:52.507
THE GUY CAN'T HANDLE NUTS.

01:52.540 --> 01:53.632
- [chuckling] WHAT?

01:53.680 --> 01:55.830
- SHAWN, THE POISON WAS
DISSOLVED IN PEANUT OIL.

01:55.880 --> 01:57.404
HIS HANDS WOULD LOOK
LIKE BASEBALL MITTS

01:57.450 --> 02:00.339
IF HE EVEN GOT NEAR
THAT POISON.

02:00.380 --> 02:02.211
WHAT'D I TELL YOU?

02:08.490 --> 02:10.879
[inhales deeply] UH...

02:10.930 --> 02:14.491
OKAY! FIRST OF ALL,
LET ME APOLOGIZE

02:14.530 --> 02:17.021
FOR THIS INTERRUPTION
OF PROCESS.

02:17.070 --> 02:20.130
I BORROWED $5 FROM MY FATHER
LAST WEEK,

02:20.170 --> 02:22.092
AND HE'S DECIDED THAT NOW

02:22.140 --> 02:23.539
WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE TIME
TO COLLECT.

02:23.570 --> 02:24.798
WELL, HERE YOU GO, POP.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.808
HERE'S YOUR FIVE CLAMS.
TAKE IT.

02:26.840 --> 02:28.330
BUY YOUR LOTTO TICKETS.

02:28.380 --> 02:31.747
WASTE IT ON FALSE HOPES,
EASY DREAMS.

02:31.780 --> 02:33.816
MEANWHILE, I WILL GO BACK
TO DOING WHAT I DO,

02:33.850 --> 02:35.670
WHICH IS WORKING
FOR A LIVING.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.278
SPEAKING
OF WORKING FOR A LIVING,

02:37.320 --> 02:39.459
HOW CAN YOU, SIR,

02:39.490 --> 02:41.287
STAND THERE
WITH A CLEAN CONSCIENCE,

02:41.320 --> 02:43.049
WHILE I ACCUSE
AN INNOCENT YOUNG MAN

02:43.090 --> 02:46.150
OR MURDER, WHEN IT WAS
IN FACT YOU--YES, YOU--

02:46.200 --> 02:48.998
WHO POISONED
MR. CAMFINI'S PIZZA?

02:49.030 --> 02:51.362
- YOU DID THIS?

02:54.370 --> 02:55.439
- YES, I DID.

02:55.470 --> 02:58.234
I'VE HAD THIS PLACE
FOR 25 YEARS.

02:58.270 --> 02:59.271
I WASN'T GONNA LET ANYONE

02:59.310 --> 03:01.699
SELL OFF MY PLACE
TO SOME CHAIN.

03:01.740 --> 03:03.071
THIS IS A FAMILY BUSINESS.

03:03.110 --> 03:05.704
- YEAH, I KNOW.
I'M YOUR NEPHEW.

03:05.750 --> 03:09.140
YOU WERE GONNA LET HIM
TAKE ME?

03:09.180 --> 03:10.841
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
MY WORK HERE IS DONE.

03:10.890 --> 03:11.914
JULES, CUFF HIM.

03:11.950 --> 03:13.417
LASSIE, FINISH
TOPPING THAT PIZZA.

03:13.460 --> 03:16.987
[Mr. Vito and Sal
arguing indistinctly]

03:18.630 --> 03:19.858
- I GOT HERE
AS FAST AS I COULD.

03:19.900 --> 03:20.889
WHAT DID I MISS?

03:20.930 --> 03:21.919
- JUST ME NAILIN' THAT GUY.

03:21.960 --> 03:23.291
- WHOA! WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

03:23.330 --> 03:24.399
I NAILED THE GUY.

03:24.430 --> 03:25.795
HOW CAN YOU REWRITE
HISTORY LIKE THAT?

03:25.830 --> 03:27.138
- YOU'RE TALKIN' TO A GUY

03:27.170 --> 03:28.467
WHO WROTE A TERM PAPER
ON PRESIDENT MITCHELL.

03:28.500 --> 03:29.706
- SHAWN, THE FACT IS,

03:29.740 --> 03:31.469
I SAVED YOUR ASS IN THERE
ONCE AGAIN.

03:31.510 --> 03:32.602
IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME.

03:32.640 --> 03:33.629
- NAME ANOTHER.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.033
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

03:35.080 --> 03:36.945
WHEN DON'T YOU COME TO ME
FOR LAST-MINUTE GUIDANCE?

03:36.980 --> 03:38.447
- SHH, SHH, SHH!
OKAY, OKAY.

03:38.480 --> 03:40.414
I'M IN A SLUMP.
GIMME A BREAK.

03:40.450 --> 03:42.714
I'LL GIVE YOU THIS ONE
ON A TECHNICALITY.

03:42.750 --> 03:44.047
BUT ALL
THE OTHER STUFF YOU DO,

03:44.090 --> 03:47.856
DON'T YOU THINK THAT FALLS
UNDER FATHERLY DUTIES?

03:47.890 --> 03:50.051
DID THAT NOT SOUND
LIKE A THANK YOU?

03:50.090 --> 03:51.728
- HELLO.

OR LAVENDER GOOMS

04:02.810 --> 04:05.131

04:05.170 --> 04:07.570

REALLY IS A FAN.

04:07.610 --> 04:09.237
- A FAN OR A STALKER.

04:09.280 --> 04:10.474
GHEE BUTTERSNAPS WAS SAID

04:10.510 --> 04:12.239

04:15.180 --> 04:17.910
AND THIS LAST
IS VERY IMPRESSIVE.

04:17.950 --> 04:20.817
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING
TO ACCUSE THAT FIRST GENTLEMAN.

04:20.860 --> 04:22.384
WOULD HAVE BEEN
COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS.

04:22.430 --> 04:24.022
all: [laughing]

04:24.060 --> 04:26.893

04:26.930 --> 04:28.955
I MEAN, HE DID HAVE A
DOUCHEY FACE, DON'T YOU THINK?

04:29.000 --> 04:30.092
- WELL, I SAW
WHAT YOU WERE UP TO.

04:30.130 --> 04:31.222
YOU TURNED IT AROUND.

04:31.270 --> 04:33.568
YOU CREATED A FALSE SENSE
OF SECURITY

04:33.600 --> 04:34.692
FOR THE REAL CULPRIT,

04:34.740 --> 04:37.038
AND THEN YOU COERCED
A CONFESSION OUT OF HIM.

04:37.070 --> 04:38.037
I MEAN, THAT WAS JUST...

04:38.070 --> 04:39.037
[imitating arrow flying]

- [gaSPSJ

04:40.280 --> 04:41.269

BUT NO THANK YOU.

04:48.750 --> 04:49.910
HE ALREADY HAS A JOB.

04:49.950 --> 04:51.884

AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR

07:58.410 --> 08:00.105
WORKING WITH VARIOUS
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES,

08:00.140 --> 08:01.402
INCLUDING THE K.G.B.

08:01.440 --> 08:03.749
SHE'S NOW WORKING
FOR THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT

08:03.780 --> 08:05.509
IN A PREVENTATIVE CAPACITY.

08:05.550 --> 08:06.812
- INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR.

08:06.850 --> 08:08.477
DOES THAT MEAN THAT SHE'S--
- HIT WOMAN? YES.

08:08.520 --> 08:10.681
- SO I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T TRY--
- DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.

08:10.720 --> 08:13.086
- AND ROUNDING OUT OUR TEAM
IS ALAN ZENUK,

08:13.120 --> 08:15.054
WHO GRADUATED FROM M.I.T.

08:15.090 --> 08:17.320
AND IS NOW A LEADING
CRIME STATISTICIAN,

08:17.360 --> 08:19.089
DEALING WITH ODDS
AND PROBABILITIES.

08:19.130 --> 08:21.451
- I SEE. BUT DIDN'T
WINNIE FROM THE WONDER YEARS

08:21.500 --> 08:23.320
ALSO DO THAT,
AND WOULDN'T IT HAVE BEEN

08:23.370 --> 08:24.621
WAY COOLER
TO HAVE HER INSTEAD?

08:24.670 --> 08:25.659
- [laughs]

08:25.700 --> 08:27.463
AND I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU

08:27.500 --> 08:30.003
TO SHAWN SPENCER
AND BURTON GUSTER,

08:30.040 --> 08:32.508
WHO STARTED
A PSYCHIC DETECTIVE AGENCY

08:32.540 --> 08:34.405
JUST FOUR YEARS AGO
AND HAVE SINCE SOLVED

08:34.440 --> 08:35.976
AN IMPRESSIVE NUMBER
OF CASES

08:36.010 --> 08:37.875
FOR THE LOCAL
POLICE DEPARTMENT.

08:37.910 --> 08:38.945
GENTLEMEN, HAVE A SEAT.

08:38.980 --> 08:41.175
- OH, ALL RIGHT.

08:41.220 --> 08:43.848
- AND, UH, OF COURSE,
YOU ALL KNOW BY NOW

08:43.890 --> 08:45.187
THIS IS OUR CLIENT,

08:45.220 --> 08:48.280
MAVERICK BILLIONAIRE,
ASHTON BONAVENTU RE.

08:48.320 --> 08:49.582
HE IS AN INNOVATOR

08:49.630 --> 08:52.383
ON THE CUTTING EDGE
OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL INDUSTRY.

08:52.430 --> 08:53.454
- THAT MAKES SENSE.

08:53.500 --> 08:54.592
I SAW ON CRIBS

08:54.630 --> 08:55.858
THAT HE HAS A SODA FOUNTAIN
IN HIS BEDROOM.

08:55.900 --> 08:57.925
- MM-HMM. YES, WELL,
ODDLY ENOUGH,

08:57.970 --> 08:59.392
THAT IS CORRECT AS WELL.

08:59.430 --> 09:01.159
- HE ALSO TURNED WALL STREET
UPSIDE DOWN

09:01.200 --> 09:03.407
WHEN HE BOUGHT OUT
TETRON TECH IN '98.

09:03.440 --> 09:04.532
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
LOST THEIR JOBS.

09:04.570 --> 09:07.437
- MR. GUSTER IS ON POINT,
ACTUALLY.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.436
YOU DO NOT DO AS WELL
AS HE HAS DONE

09:09.480 --> 09:12.643
WITHOUT LEAVING A TIDAL WAVE
OF ENEMIES IN YOUR WAKE,

09:12.680 --> 09:14.147
AND THERE HAVE BEEN
TH REE ATTEMPTS

09:14.180 --> 09:16.819
ON MR. BONAVENTURE'S LIFE
IN THE LAST TWO YEARS.

09:16.850 --> 09:18.818
IT HAS
BECOME PAINFULLY APPARENT

09:18.850 --> 09:21.978
THAT THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS
IN HIS SECURITY DETAIL,

09:22.020 --> 09:24.523
AND IT IS YOUR JOB
TO TELL US WHAT THEY ARE.

09:24.560 --> 09:25.959
IF A BAD GUY CAN DO IT,

09:25.990 --> 09:28.823
I WANT US TO HAVE
CONSIDERED IT BEFOREHAND.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.066
ANY QUESTIONS?

09:30.100 --> 09:32.125
- YES, I HAVE A QUESTION
FOR THE STATISTICIAN

09:32.170 --> 09:34.092
FORMERLY KNOWN
AS KENNETH BRANAGH.

09:34.140 --> 09:35.789
WITHOUT LOOKING,
CAN YOU TELL ME EXACTLY

09:35.840 --> 09:37.068
HOW MANY SKITTLES
ARE IN THIS BOWL?

09:37.110 --> 09:38.202
- SHAWN.
- OH, SORRY.

09:38.240 --> 09:39.935
AND WHAT
IS THE PROBABILITY

09:39.980 --> 09:42.005
THAT GUS
WILL CHOOSE A GREEN ONE?

09:42.040 --> 09:43.405
- EXCUSE ME.

09:43.450 --> 09:45.668
WHAT BRINGS MR. BONAVENTURE
TO SANTA BARBARA?

09:45.710 --> 09:47.519
- THE PURPOSE OF THE VISIT

09:47.550 --> 09:49.415
IS THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL
BOARD OF DIRECTORS ADDRESS

09:49.450 --> 09:52.658
AND TO ANNOUNCE THE ROLLOUT
OF A MAJOR NEW PRODUCT.

09:52.690 --> 09:54.009
PERHAPS WE SHOULD HEAR
THE REST

09:54.060 --> 09:56.358
FROM MR. BONAVENTURE
HIMSELF.

09:56.390 --> 09:57.482
[static hissing]

09:57.530 --> 09:58.679
- [British accent]
HELLO, TEAM.

09:58.730 --> 10:00.391
THANK YOU
FOR PARTICIPATING.

10:00.430 --> 10:03.069
I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHAT IT'S LIKE

10:03.100 --> 10:04.522
TO BE IN YOUR SHOES
RIGHT NOW,

10:04.570 --> 10:05.923
HAVING
YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES.

10:05.970 --> 10:09.531
JUST KNOW THAT I WILL DO
WHATEVER I CAN

10:09.570 --> 10:12.038
TO HELP YOU KEEP ME
ALIVE OUT THERE, ALL RIGHT?

10:12.070 --> 10:13.799
- YEAH, WELL, WE'RE HERE
TO SERVE YOU, SIR,

10:13.840 --> 10:15.831
SO RELAX.
WE'RE ON TOP OF IT.

10:15.880 --> 10:18.747
- MR. BONAVENTURE?
SPENCER--SHAWN SPENCER HERE.

10:18.780 --> 10:20.372
UH, DO YOU THINK
THAT THERE IS A MARKET

10:25.390 --> 10:26.948
- YOU HAVE TO PUSH
THE BUTTON TO TALK.

10:26.990 --> 10:29.015
[static hissing]

10:29.060 --> 10:30.129
- OH, CAN YOU, UH...

10:30.160 --> 10:34.654
- NO. I'M NOT GONNA
ASK HIM AGAIN.

10:34.700 --> 10:36.349
HE WENT SCROOGE ON ME.
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

10:36.400 --> 10:38.868
- OKAY, WELL,
IF THERE'S NOTHING MORE,

10:38.900 --> 10:40.595
LET'S GET TO WORK.

10:45.240 --> 10:47.401
- THIS IS A SCHEMATIC OF THE
BUILDING WHERE WE THINK

10:47.440 --> 10:49.169
THE ATTACKER WILL STRIKE.

10:49.210 --> 10:50.507
I'M LOOKIN'
AT THE SERVICE ENTRANCE

10:50.550 --> 10:52.438
TO THE LOWER KITCHEN
OF THE HOTEL RIGHT HERE.

10:52.480 --> 10:53.742
- [Russian accent]
IT IS OFF-LIMITS.

10:53.780 --> 10:55.418
YOU CANNOT CONTROL
A WORKING ENVIRONMENT

10:55.450 --> 10:56.576
WITH THAT
MANY MOVING PIECES.

10:56.620 --> 10:57.746
- I AGREE.

10:57.790 --> 10:59.143
MOST BREACHES
WOULD OCCUR IN THAT KITCHEN.

10:59.190 --> 11:00.509
- THE ONLY TACTIC HERE

11:00.560 --> 11:01.618
IS TO MAKE
THE SECURITY TEAM

11:01.660 --> 11:02.684
LOOK THE OTHER WAY.

11:02.730 --> 11:04.322
GIVE ME THAT MAP.
I'LL SHOW YOU.

11:04.360 --> 11:06.180
- [whispering] SHAWN,
WE'RE NOT PARTICIPATING.

11:06.230 --> 11:08.221
- GUS, THEY MIGHT AS WELL
BE SPEAKING AUSTRALIAN.

11:08.260 --> 11:09.761
NOW, LOOK,
IT'S LIKE PART GIRAFFE,

11:09.800 --> 11:11.199
PART LOCH NESS MONSTER.

11:11.230 --> 11:12.299
- SAY SOMETHING.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.605
- AHEM!
I'M HAVING A VISION.

11:18.640 --> 11:21.609
MR. SNOWDEN.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.847
YOU STILL CARE FOR HER
VERY DEEPLY, DON'T YOU?

11:23.880 --> 11:25.700
- YES, THAT'S CORRECT.

11:29.420 --> 11:31.047
- SVETLANA?

11:31.090 --> 11:33.513
YOU RECENTLY MOVED
INTO A NEW RESIDENCE,

11:33.560 --> 11:35.016
DID YOU NOT?
CONGRATULATIONS.

11:35.060 --> 11:38.621
VERY SEXY.
LAVA LAMPS, YES?

11:38.660 --> 11:39.752
- WHAT DOES THAT
HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING?

11:39.800 --> 11:41.529
- I'M NOT SURE YET, BOYD.

11:41.560 --> 11:42.993
THAT IS
HOW MY GIFT WORKS.

11:43.030 --> 11:45.726
IT'S LIKE ACID REFLUX,
BUT INSTEAD OF ACID,

11:45.770 --> 11:47.658
IT'S PSYCHIC-NESS.
IT'S PSYCHIC-NESS REFLUX.

11:47.700 --> 11:50.464
GIMME YOUR WATCH. I'LL TELL YOU
EXACTLY WHEN YOU'RE GONNA DIE.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.262
- THANKS FOR THE PARLOR TRICKS,
BUT NO.

11:52.310 --> 11:53.868
- MR. SPENCER,
IF YOU DON'T MIND,

11:53.910 --> 11:55.070
WE'RE TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

11:55.110 --> 11:57.249
WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO
IF BULLETS FLY

11:57.280 --> 11:59.646
IN THIS TIGHT
KITCHEN PROXIMITY HERE,

11:59.680 --> 12:01.272
SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING ON TOPIC.

12:01.320 --> 12:02.446
- UNDER SIEGE.

12:02.480 --> 12:04.414
SEAGAL USED A SPATULA
TO DEFLECT BULLETS.

12:04.450 --> 12:06.589
- SO YOU'RE SAYING WE ARM
OUR PEOPLE WITH SPATULAS?

12:06.620 --> 12:08.178
- NO, I'M SAYING
IT WAS PRETTY COOL,

12:08.220 --> 12:09.881
AND HE'S ABOVE THE LAW
AGAIN.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.955
- WELL, I CALCULATE
THE PROBABILITY

12:11.990 --> 12:15.255
OF THAT OCCURRING
TO BE 0.0%.

12:15.300 --> 12:18.269
- OKAY. LET'S SWITCH
TO EXPLOSIVES

12:18.300 --> 12:19.767
AS A PRESENT THREAT.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.529
- WELL, I'VE SEEN
TINY PLASTIQUE EXPLOSIVES

12:21.570 --> 12:22.537
IN CELL PHONES.

12:22.570 --> 12:24.538
- HOW CRUDE
AND INACCURATE.

12:24.570 --> 12:25.935
GETTING THE PHONE
TO THE TARGET

12:25.970 --> 12:27.301
IS DIFFICULT ENOUGH.

12:27.340 --> 12:29.877
GETTING THEM TO USE IT
IS NOT PREDICT ABLE.

12:29.910 --> 12:31.741
- AND HOW DO YOU TARGET
YOUR MARK?

12:31.780 --> 12:33.771
- WELL, PERSONALLY,
I'M QUITE FOND OF POISONS.

12:33.820 --> 12:35.970
- SO A CELL PHONE
ISN'T PREDICTABLE ENOUGH,

12:36.020 --> 12:37.317
BUT A POISON
IS PERFECT LY RELIABLE.

12:37.350 --> 12:38.317
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

12:38.350 --> 12:39.647
- I USE SKIN CONTACT.

12:39.690 --> 12:41.282
I SPRAY IT
DIRECTLY ON THEM.

12:41.320 --> 12:43.959
IT'S AS IF I SNEEZED,
AND THEN IT'S, UH...

12:43.990 --> 12:45.651
HOW DO YOU SAY?
GOOD NIGHT, CHARLIE.

12:45.690 --> 12:48.158
- GUS, HOW BAD
DO YOU WISH YOU WERE CHARLIE?

12:48.200 --> 12:50.327
- SHE'S A KILLER, SHAWN.
SHE KILLS PEOPLE.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.497
- BUT HOW BAD?
- REALLY BAD.

12:52.530 --> 12:53.861
- AND HOW DO YOU GET CLOSE?

12:53.900 --> 12:56.266
- THE EASY ANSWER IS
ANY KIND OF UNIFORM.

12:56.300 --> 12:59.064
- MM, AN ASSASSIN
IS 40% MORE LIKELY

12:59.110 --> 13:00.930
TO BE DISGUISED
AS A SERVICE PERSON.

13:00.980 --> 13:03.346
WHENEVER I CONSULT,
I ALWAYS SUGGEST

13:03.380 --> 13:04.779
THAT WE IMMEDIATELY
FOCUS IN

13:04.810 --> 13:06.107
ON DELIVERY PERSONNEL.

13:06.150 --> 13:08.141
YOU SEE, THE GENERAL PUBLIC
ARE CONDITIONED

13:08.180 --> 13:10.045
TO FIND UNIFORMED PERSONS
AS LESS SUSPICIOUS.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.819
- WHEN I HAD TO WALK
THROUGH A CROWD,

13:11.850 --> 13:13.852
I'D ALWAYS TRY TO APPEAR
AS FEMININE

13:13.890 --> 13:15.380
AND DISARMING AS POSSIBLE.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.229
- YOU WORE A BIKINI
MADE OF WHIPPED CREAM?

13:17.260 --> 13:19.820
- NO. I CARRY A BABY.

13:22.100 --> 13:23.863
A PLASTIC ONE,
OF COURSE.

13:23.900 --> 13:26.289
I WAS BORN WITHOUT
A MATERNAL INSTINCT.

13:26.330 --> 13:29.458
- HM. WELL,
THE LARGER QUESTION IS

13:29.500 --> 13:31.968
WHAT GAPS ARE THERE
IN THE SECURITY SYSTEM

13:32.010 --> 13:33.272
THAT WE CAN'T ACCOUNT FOR?

13:33.310 --> 13:34.334
- THERE ARE ALWAYS GAPS.

13:34.380 --> 13:35.335
YOU CAN'T ACCOUNT
FOR EVERYTHING.

13:35.380 --> 13:37.348
- WE CAN.
WE HAVE TO.

13:39.010 --> 13:41.911
OKAY, LET'S, UH,
TAKE A TEN-MINUTE BREAK.

13:41.950 --> 13:44.180
I HAVE TO HAVE
A CONFERENCE CALL

13:44.220 --> 13:46.245
WITH MR. BONAVENTURE'S
ADVANCE TEAM.

13:46.290 --> 13:47.587
- SHAWN.
- YES?

13:47.620 --> 13:48.712
- CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

13:48.760 --> 13:50.057
- CERTAINLY.
- EXCUSE ME.

13:50.090 --> 13:51.079
- EXCUSE US.

13:51.130 --> 13:52.324
- WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.898
- KEEP YOUR EYES
OFF MY DRAFT, BOYD.

13:55.930 --> 13:57.568
- FOLLOW ME, SHAWN.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.659
- PLEASE TELL ME THAT
THE TRAMPOLINE HAS ARRIVED.

13:59.700 --> 14:00.667
- IT'S NOT THE TRAMPOLINE.

14:00.700 --> 14:01.792
- GUS, WHAT IS IT?

14:01.840 --> 14:04.206
TIME IS OF THE "ES-SANCE."

14:06.540 --> 14:09.179
- YES, SIR.
YES, SIR, I UNDERSTAND.

14:09.210 --> 14:10.438
WE'LL LET 'EM KNOW
RIGHT AWAY, SIR.

14:10.480 --> 14:13.278
- OVER HERE, SHAWN.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.049
- DUDE, THIS IS
KIND OF EXCITING.

14:15.080 --> 14:16.172
WHAT'S BEHIND THERE?

14:17.220 --> 14:18.881
THAT SAYS "EXIT."
- I KNOW.

14:18.920 --> 14:20.387
WE ARE COMPLETELY MAKING
FOOLS OF OURSELVES

14:20.420 --> 14:21.512
INSIDE THERE, SHAWN.

14:21.560 --> 14:23.482
WE NEED TO CUT OUR LOSSES
AND GO HOME.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.589
THIS SLUMP OF YOURS
IS OUT OF CONTROL.

14:25.630 --> 14:27.598
- LOOK, I ADMIT WE'RE HAVING
SOME EARLY TROUBLE,

14:27.630 --> 14:29.996
BUT THAT ROOM IS LIKE
KRYPTONITE TO MY SKILLS.

14:30.030 --> 14:31.759
IT'S, LIKE,
NEUTRALIZING MY WEAPONS.

14:31.800 --> 14:33.438
I NEED TO SEE THINGS.
I NEED TO TOUCH STUFF.

14:33.470 --> 14:34.596
- HAS IT EVER OCCURRED
TO YOU

14:34.640 --> 14:35.993
THAT TH ESE ARE
THE EXACT KIND OF PEOPLE

14:36.040 --> 14:37.905
THAT COULD FIGURE OUT
YOU'RE NOT WHO YOU SAY YOU ARE?

14:37.940 --> 14:38.929
- COME ON, SON.

14:38.970 --> 14:40.278
- DO NOT DO
ED LOVER ON ME, SHAWN.

14:40.310 --> 14:41.732
- ALL WE NEED TO DO
IS WOW THEM

14:41.780 --> 14:43.509
WITH A COUPLE OF IDEAS AND
WE'RE RIGHT BACK IN BUSINESS.

14:43.550 --> 14:44.642
- OR COMPLETELY
OUT OF BUSINESS.

14:44.680 --> 14:46.477
YOU'RE PLAYING
WITH FIRE HERE.

14:46.510 --> 14:47.818
LOOK, I HATE TO SAY THIS,

14:47.850 --> 14:48.839
BUT IF WE'RE
GONNA STAY HERE,

14:48.880 --> 14:49.847
YOU NEED TO CALL
YOUR DAD.

14:49.880 --> 14:51.586
- SINCE WHEN
DO I NEED HIS HELP?

14:51.620 --> 14:53.087
- YOU CALLED HIM
FOR DIRECTIONS TO GET HERE.

14:53.120 --> 14:54.815
- WHICH WE DIDN'T USE.

14:54.860 --> 14:56.919
LOOK, GUS,
I MAY NOT BE A PLANNER,

14:56.960 --> 14:58.257
OR A DETAIL MAN,

14:58.290 --> 14:59.359
OR A TAXPAYER,

14:59.390 --> 15:00.994
BUT WHEN PUSH
COMES TO SHOVE,

15:01.030 --> 15:02.622
I WORK,
AND I GET THE JOB DONE.

15:02.660 --> 15:03.922
- MY GOSH.

15:03.970 --> 15:05.119
- NOW FOLLOW ME
BACK IN THERE,

15:05.170 --> 15:06.489
AND LET'S
BLOW THESE GUYS' MINDS,

15:06.530 --> 15:08.464
SCANNERS-STYLE.

15:10.670 --> 15:12.638
- WE CHOSE THIS HOTEL
SPECIFICALLY

15:12.670 --> 15:14.570
BECAUSE NONE OF
THE SURROUNDING BUILDINGS

15:14.610 --> 15:16.874
ARE HIGHER
THAN TWO STORIES,

15:16.910 --> 15:19.947
SO IF WE SURROUND HIM
WITH ALL SIX BODYGUARDS,

15:19.980 --> 15:21.845
THEN WE HAVE SEEMINGLY
ELIMINATED

15:21.880 --> 15:23.609
ALL POSSIBILITIES
OF AN ATTACK.

15:23.650 --> 15:24.844
SO WHAT ARE WE MISSING?

15:24.890 --> 15:26.039
- [whispering]
HERE COMES THE WOW.

15:26.090 --> 15:28.513
- YES, MR. SPENCER,
YOU HAVE SOMETHING?

15:28.560 --> 15:30.357
- AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I DO, WALT.

15:30.390 --> 15:33.553
IF THE ASSASSIN IS UNABLE
TO TAKE A SHOT FROM ABOVE,

15:33.600 --> 15:36.592
THEN I THINK THERE IS
A VERY, VERY GOOD POSSIBILITY

15:36.630 --> 15:38.291
THAT HE WILL SHOOT
FROM BENEATHHH.

15:38.330 --> 15:39.490
- FROM BENEATH?
- INDEED.

15:39.530 --> 15:41.896
SHOOT FROM BENEATHHH.

15:41.940 --> 15:44.204
- SO, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
THE KILLER'S LIKE A GROUNDHOG,

15:44.240 --> 15:45.764
WHO DIGS LITTLE TUNNELS
IN THE EARTH,

15:45.810 --> 15:46.799
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

15:46.840 --> 15:47.807
[Svetlana laughs]

15:47.840 --> 15:49.398
- WHAT ARE YOU
CALCULATING, ALAN?

15:49.440 --> 15:51.476
- I'M FIGURING THE ODDS
OF MR. SPENCER GETTING FIRED.

15:51.510 --> 15:52.807
- WHAT?

15:52.850 --> 15:54.715
- OKAY, I THINK
THAT'S ABOUT ENOUGH FOR TODAY.

15:54.750 --> 15:56.240
LET'S MEET TOMORROW,
8:00 SHARP.

15:56.280 --> 15:59.841
- WHAT? I WAS JUST
GETTIN' WARMED UP, MAN.

15:59.890 --> 16:01.016
- WOW.

16:05.960 --> 16:08.121
- IT'S REALLY SCRAPING
THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL,

16:08.160 --> 16:09.388
ASKING LASSIE FOR HELP.

16:09.430 --> 16:10.863
- SHAWN, YOUR ABILITY
TO KNOW NOTHING

16:10.900 --> 16:13.892
ABOUT REAL POLICE WORK
HAS FINALLY CAUGHT UP TO YOU.

16:13.940 --> 16:15.293
YOU KNOW,
WE CAN ALWAYS JUST--

16:15.340 --> 16:17.501
- WE'RE NOT CALLING MY DAD.
I CAN DO THIS BY MYSELF.

16:17.540 --> 16:20.475
- MR. SPENCER,
EXACTLY HOW DOES THAT WORK?

16:20.510 --> 16:22.307
- WHATEVER DO YOU MEAN,
CHIEF?

16:22.340 --> 16:23.648
- WITH YOUR FATHER.

16:23.680 --> 16:25.272
SEE, I SAW HIM
AT THE PIZZA PLACE.

16:25.310 --> 16:26.948
- YOU SURE DID.

16:26.980 --> 16:29.346
YOU SEE, HE MISSED
MOST OF MY BASEBALL GAMES

16:29.380 --> 16:31.109
AS A KID, AND RECENTLY,

16:31.150 --> 16:33.584
HE HAS BEEN TRYING
TO SHOW ME MORE SUPPORT

16:33.620 --> 16:37.283
IN MY VENTURES.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.195
- THIS IS BIG BOY WORK,
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT?

16:44.230 --> 16:45.925
- JUST A QUICK QUESTION,
MORE OF A TRIVIA THING.

16:45.970 --> 16:46.925
KIND OF A "WHAT IF."

16:46.970 --> 16:48.528
- GET TO IT.

16:48.570 --> 16:49.935
- HAVE YOU EVER GIVEN
ANY THOUGHT TO HOW OR WHEN

16:49.970 --> 16:51.528
SOMEONE WOULD TRY TO
ASSASSINATE ASHTON BONAVENTURE?

16:51.570 --> 16:52.764
AND DON'T JUST SPOUT OUT

16:52.810 --> 16:54.072
EVERYTHING TOM CRUISE DID
IN VALKYRIE,

16:54.110 --> 16:55.907
'CAUSE I ALREADY PITCHED THAT.
- BONAVENTURE?

16:55.940 --> 16:57.908
YOU'RE WORKING
FOR BONAVENTU RE?

16:57.950 --> 16:59.941
- US, AND
SOME OTHER EXPERTS.

16:59.980 --> 17:01.516
- MAN, I BEEN TRYING
SINCE, LIKE, FOREVER

17:01.550 --> 17:03.586
TO GET ON ONE OF THESE
PRIVATE SECURITY DETAILS.

17:03.620 --> 17:05.144
I ONCE WROTE A LETTER
TO GERALD FORD

17:05.190 --> 17:07.283
WHEN I WAS A KID, TELLING HIM
I WANTED TO PROTECT HIM,

17:07.320 --> 17:08.719
AND THAT I LOVED HIM.

17:08.760 --> 17:10.648
- WELL, THIS MIGHT BE
YOUR LUCKY DAY, LASSIE,

17:10.690 --> 17:12.453
'CAUSE I'M THINKING
OF LETTING YOU IN. WHAT?

17:12.490 --> 17:13.457
THROWING YOU A BONE.

17:13.500 --> 17:14.626
- I'M NOT GOING TO HELP YOU.

17:14.660 --> 17:15.729
IF THEY WANTED MY IDEAS

17:15.760 --> 17:17.296
THEY COULD HAVE ASKED ME
THEMSELVES.

17:17.330 --> 17:19.696
- LASSIE, GUS HAS
100 LARGE IN HIS POCKET.

17:21.670 --> 17:22.932
- FAIR ENOUGH.
YOU DRIVE A HARD BARGAIN.

17:22.970 --> 17:24.130
HOW ABOUT THREE BUCKS
FOR A BABY NUGGET?

17:24.170 --> 17:25.603
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS!

17:25.640 --> 17:27.107
I KNOW EVERYTHING THERE IS
ABOUT BONAVENTURE.

17:27.140 --> 17:29.131
I'VE BEEN DEALING
WITH HIS PEOPLE FOR WEEKS,

17:29.180 --> 17:30.340
COORDINATING CROWD CONTROL.

17:30.380 --> 17:32.268
I WOULD HAVE BEEN
A REAL ASSET IN THAT ROOM.

17:32.310 --> 17:34.574
I'M GONNA CALL
BILL MCGOLDRICK.

17:34.620 --> 17:36.440
- WHO?

17:36.480 --> 17:38.289
- HE'S HEAD OF SECURITY.
I KNEW HE DIDN'T LIKE ME.

17:38.320 --> 17:39.617
- I DON'T KNOW
WHO THAT IS.

17:39.650 --> 17:41.083
WE'VE BEEN DEALING DIRECTLY
WITH WALTER SNOWDEN.

17:41.120 --> 17:43.259
- WHO'S THAT?
- WALTER SNOWDEN?

17:43.290 --> 17:44.427
HEAD OF SNOWDEN SECURITY?

17:44.460 --> 17:45.950
- I'VE NEVER HEARD
OF SNOWDEN SECURITY.

17:45.990 --> 17:47.491
- YOU DON'T KNOW
WALTER SNOWDEN?

17:47.530 --> 17:49.418
- I'VE NEVER HEARD
OF WALTER SNOWDEN

17:49.460 --> 17:51.894
OR SNOWDEN SECURITY
IN MY LIFE.

17:51.930 --> 17:53.067
WHO IS HE?

17:53.100 --> 17:55.967
- ...THIS CENTURY.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.161
- UH, PERHAPS WE SHOULD
HEAR THE REST

17:58.210 --> 18:01.338
FROM MR. BONAVENTURE
HIMSELF.

18:01.380 --> 18:03.007
- JUST KNOW...

18:03.040 --> 18:06.942
- HE'S THE HEAD
OF BONAVENTURE--

18:06.980 --> 18:10.916
HEAD OF THINK TANK
OPERATIONS.

18:10.950 --> 18:12.281
CRAP.

18:20.960 --> 18:22.393
- AW, CRAP.

18:23.670 --> 18:26.662
NOW I GOTTA GET A WARRANT
TO GET IN THIS PLACE.

18:31.510 --> 18:33.137
- AW, MAN.

18:35.740 --> 18:37.640
- WHAT THE HELL?

18:46.650 --> 18:48.584
- AW, DAMN.

18:50.060 --> 18:51.618
SKITTLES?

18:51.660 --> 18:54.094
- BONAVENTURE'S TEAM HAS
NEVER HEARD OF SNOWDEN, EITHER.

18:54.130 --> 18:55.620
- I DON'T GET IT.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.891
WE SAW HIM ON VIDEO.

18:58.930 --> 19:00.989
- VIDEO WAS FAKE, GUS.
- FAKE?

19:01.040 --> 19:02.291
- HELLO, TEAM.

19:02.340 --> 19:04.001
THANK YOU
FOR PARTICIPATING.

19:04.040 --> 19:05.837
- IT WAS FOOTAGE
OF BONAVENTURE

19:05.870 --> 19:06.905
AT A GOLF TOURNAMENT

19:06.940 --> 19:08.339
OR SALES CONVENTION
OR SOMETHING.

19:08.380 --> 19:10.473
NO, SHOULD
HAVE KNOWN BETTER.

19:10.510 --> 19:13.570
HE WOULD HAVE LOVED
MY PILLOW COMB IDEA.

19:13.620 --> 19:14.746
SNOWDEN WAS THE ONE

19:14.780 --> 19:15.974
WHO HAD TRIED
TO KILL HIM IN THE PAST,

19:16.020 --> 19:17.749
BUT HE COULD NEVER CRACK
BONAVENTURE'S SECURITY.

19:17.790 --> 19:19.087
- IF A BAD GUY CAN DO IT,

19:19.120 --> 19:21.588
I WANT US TO HAVE CONSIDERED
IT BEFOREHAND.

19:21.620 --> 19:23.759
- SO HE PUTS TOGETHER
THIS THINK TANK

19:23.790 --> 19:25.326
TO GATHER AS MANY IDEAS
AS POSSIBLE

19:25.360 --> 19:27.453
SO THAT HE CAN CARRY OUT
THE HIT SUCCESSFULLY.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.922
- THANK YOU.
THERE'S NO RECORD

19:28.960 --> 19:30.268
OF A WALTER SNOWDEN
IN OUR DATABASE.

19:30.300 --> 19:31.392
- WHAT ABOUT THE OTHERS?

19:31.430 --> 19:33.660
- BOYD, PROGOYOVIC,
AND ZENUK ALL CHECK OUT.

19:33.700 --> 19:35.236
WE'RE ROUNDING THEM UP
FOR QUESTIONING.

19:35.270 --> 19:36.396
- SO LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT.

19:36.440 --> 19:37.839
YOU JOINED
THIS ORGANIZATION,

19:37.870 --> 19:39.633
DIDN'T BOTHER TO CHECK
IF THEY WERE LEGIT,

19:39.670 --> 19:40.876
AND THEN YOU GAVE 'EM
A BUNCH OF IDEAS

19:40.910 --> 19:42.207
ABOUT HOW TO KILL
ONE OF YOUR IDOLS?

19:42.240 --> 19:44.470
- IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION,
ALL OF HIS IDEAS STANK.

19:44.510 --> 19:45.647
- STUNK.
- STANK.

19:45.680 --> 19:47.318
- STINKEDED?
- I'M SURE THEY DID.

19:47.350 --> 19:48.840
SPENCER, I WON'T SAY
THAT I'M NOT GONNA

19:48.880 --> 19:50.017
HOLD THIS
OVER YOUR HEAD FOREVER,

19:50.050 --> 19:51.586
BECAUSE, LET'S BE HONEST,
OF COURSE I AM.

19:51.620 --> 19:53.383
- LOOK, LASSIE, NOW
IS NOT THE TIME TO GLOAT

19:53.420 --> 19:55.058
BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT FOR
THE FIRST TIME IN YOUR LIFE.

19:55.090 --> 19:56.580
I'M JUST HAVING
A MINI SLUMP.

19:56.620 --> 19:58.850
THE IMPORTANT THING IS,
I NEED EVIDENCE BAGS

19:58.890 --> 20:00.551
FOR THE REST
OF THOSE SKITTLES.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.522
AND REMEMBER, WE HAVE
FOUR DAYS TO FIND THIS GUY.

20:02.560 --> 20:03.925
- WHY FOUR DAYS?

20:03.970 --> 20:05.961
- 'CAUSE THAT'S WHEN
BONAVENTURE GETS TO TOWN.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.695
- BONAVENTURE'S FLIGHT
GOT IN FOUR HOURS AGO.

20:07.740 --> 20:08.889
HE'S ALREADY
AT HIS HOTEL.

20:08.940 --> 20:10.931
- HOPEFULLY ALIVE.

20:14.180 --> 20:16.831
- WHAT IS THE MEANING
OF THIS INTERRUPTION?

20:16.880 --> 20:18.700
- MR. BONAVENTU RE,

20:18.750 --> 20:21.412
I BELIEVE THAT YOU WILL BE
IN GRAVE DANGER,

20:21.450 --> 20:22.940
AND BELIEVE
THAT THERE WILL BE

20:22.980 --> 20:24.618
AN ATTEMPT MADE
ON YOUR LIFE.

20:24.650 --> 20:26.709
- AND HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

20:26.750 --> 20:27.785
- BECAUSE I AM A PSYCHIC.

20:27.820 --> 20:31.278
I'M ALSO...
AN INVENTOR.

20:31.330 --> 20:33.025
IT'S A PILLOW THAT COMBS
YOUR HAIR WHILE YOU SLEEP.

20:33.060 --> 20:34.152
CHECK IT OUT.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.952
- YOU NEED TO CANCEL
YOUR SPEECH TONIGHT,

20:36.000 --> 20:37.319
AND WE NEED
TO GET YOU OUT OF TOWN.

20:37.370 --> 20:38.689
- NO, THIS IS
THE MOST IMPORTANT APPEARANCE

20:38.730 --> 20:39.799
OF THE YEAR FOR ME.

20:39.830 --> 20:42.139
12 OTHER COMPANIES
ARE TRYING TO LAUNCH

20:42.170 --> 20:43.728
WHAT I'M GOING TO ANNOUNCE.

20:43.770 --> 20:45.965
IF WE DON'T GO FIRST,
WE'RE FINISHED.

20:46.010 --> 20:47.477
FIVE YEARS
OF DEVELOPMENT.

20:47.510 --> 20:50.229
I'M GOING ON.
MY COMPANY DEPENDS ON IT.

20:50.280 --> 20:52.578
- NO, SIR, YOUR ATTACKERS
DEPEND ON IT.

20:52.610 --> 20:54.168
- I PAY THESE PEOPLE
VERY WELL

20:54.220 --> 20:55.346
TO KEEP ME SAFE,

20:55.380 --> 20:56.938
AND NOTHING IN THIS WORLD
IS GONNA STOP ME

20:56.980 --> 20:58.208
FROM MAKING THAT SPEECH.

20:58.250 --> 20:59.888
- WELL, RIGHT NOW,
YOU'RE NOT SAFE,

20:59.920 --> 21:02.616
AND THIS GUY, WHO HAS SOLVED
OVER 50 UNSOLVABLE CASES,

21:02.660 --> 21:04.059
IS YOUR BEST CHANCE
OF GETTING OUT OF HERE ALIVE.

21:04.090 --> 21:05.159
- AND WHY IS THAT?

21:05.190 --> 21:06.828
- BECAUSE SOLVING
OVER 50 UNSOLVABLE CASES

21:06.860 --> 21:08.589
IS USUALLY IMPRESSIVE
TO PEOPLE,

21:08.630 --> 21:10.291
AND ALSO BECAUSE
I SPENT THE LAST 12 HOURS

21:10.330 --> 21:12.469
WITH YOUR WOULD-BE ASSASSIN,

21:12.500 --> 21:15.162
AND I KNOW EVERY SINGLE
LITTLE THING THAT HE MIGHT TRY.

21:17.240 --> 21:20.573
- ALL RIGHT, PSYCHIC,
HERE'S YOUR SHOT.

21:20.610 --> 21:22.339
I'M GOING TO MY CAR.

21:22.380 --> 21:25.042
GET ME THERE.

21:28.350 --> 21:30.511
[cell phone rings]

21:30.550 --> 21:32.609
- I'VE EVEN SEEN
TINY PLASTIQUE EXPLOSIVES

21:32.650 --> 21:33.719
IN CELL PHONES.

21:33.760 --> 21:34.852
[cell phone rings]
- NO!

21:36.290 --> 21:37.587
DON'T ANSWER THAT.

21:37.630 --> 21:38.722
THAT STAYS WHERE IT IS.

21:38.760 --> 21:40.125
IN FACT, EVERYBODY,
CELL PHONES OUT.

21:40.160 --> 21:42.856
LET'S SEE 'EM.
NOW PUT 'EM ON THE FLOOR.

21:42.900 --> 21:45.892
- LET'S MOVE.

21:52.110 --> 21:53.577
- AND GENERALLY PEOPLE
ARE PROGRAMMED

21:53.610 --> 21:55.703
TO FIND PERSONS IN UNIFORM
LESS SUSPICIOUS.

21:55.740 --> 21:57.298
- THE MAID.

21:57.350 --> 22:01.116
THE MAID!

22:01.150 --> 22:03.539
[maid gasps]

22:07.620 --> 22:08.587
- AXE FOR MEN?

22:08.620 --> 22:09.951
WHAT?

22:11.190 --> 22:12.555
- SHE'S CLEAN.

22:15.560 --> 22:18.495
[baby cooing]

22:18.530 --> 22:20.862
- ME? I CARRY A BABY.

22:20.900 --> 22:22.162
- BABY.

22:22.200 --> 22:23.531
- THE BABY?

22:23.570 --> 22:24.559
- THE BABY!

22:26.570 --> 22:28.037
[baby crying]

22:28.080 --> 22:31.709
- BABY'S REAL.
SHE'S CLEAN.

22:31.750 --> 22:33.570
- I USE SKIN CONTACT.

22:38.420 --> 22:39.546
- FEEL IT, ORCHID MAN!

22:39.590 --> 22:40.887
NICE TRY!

22:40.920 --> 22:43.252
- STOP IT.
IT'S WATER. HE'S CLEAN.

22:43.290 --> 22:45.451
- ALL RIGHT, HE'S CLEAN.

22:52.070 --> 22:55.198
- WELL, I THINK
WE CAN ALL AGREE

22:55.240 --> 22:57.037
THAT THAT
WAS A HORRIBLE MISTAKE.

22:57.070 --> 23:00.528
GOOD JOB TACKLING
THAT MAID, THOUGH.

23:00.580 --> 23:02.673
I THINK THE ONLY THING
TO COME OUT OF THIS EXERCISE

23:02.710 --> 23:04.109
WILL BE
A SERIES OF LAWSUITS.

23:04.150 --> 23:06.277
I'D CALL MY LAWYER,

23:06.310 --> 23:09.040
BUT I SEEM
TO HAVE DROPPED MY PHONE.

23:10.280 --> 23:11.611
- WAIT!

23:14.160 --> 23:15.616
[silenced gunshots]

23:19.360 --> 23:20.725
HAIR LOOKS GREAT.

23:23.930 --> 23:25.795
CHIEF, I REALLY
DON'T SEE THE POINT

23:25.830 --> 23:27.127
IN GETTING UPSET
OVER SPILLED MILK.

23:27.170 --> 23:28.637
- WHY WOULD I BE UPSET?

23:28.670 --> 23:30.137
THE MOST POWERFUL BUSINESSMAN
IN THE STATE

23:30.170 --> 23:31.899
IS THE TARGET
OF AN ASSASSINATION,

23:31.940 --> 23:33.237
AND ONE OF MY PEOPLE
HELPED PLAN IT.

23:33.270 --> 23:35.033
- ACTUALLY, IT WAS TWO.
GUS WAS THERE AS WELL.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.035
- WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

23:36.080 --> 23:37.172
- I JUST THOUGHT
IT MIGHT HELP

23:37.210 --> 23:38.404
CUSHION THE BLOW
IF WE DISTRIBUTE THE BLAME.

23:38.450 --> 23:39.769
- CUSHION WHO?
- I GUESS ME MOSTLY.

23:39.810 --> 23:40.777
- OKAY.

23:40.820 --> 23:42.378
- CHIEF, THE MAN
THAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR

23:42.420 --> 23:44.615
IS OPERATING UNDER THE ALIAS
OF "WALTER SNOWDEN."

23:44.650 --> 23:46.618
THE REMAINING MEMBERS
OF THE BOGUS THINK TANK

23:46.650 --> 23:47.958
HAVE GIVEN US
A DETAILED DESCRIPTION

23:47.990 --> 23:49.457
OF HIS FEATURES.

23:49.490 --> 23:52.186
HE IS OBVIOUSLY WELL-FUNDED
AND DEEPLY CONNECTED.

23:52.230 --> 23:54.494
HERE'S THE SKETCH.

23:54.530 --> 23:55.451
- MAY I?

23:55.500 --> 23:56.899
- OH. UH, CERTAINLY.

23:59.230 --> 24:00.936
- JUST A MOMENT.
I KNOW THIS MAN.

24:00.970 --> 24:02.460
- DO YOU KNOW
FROM WHERE?

24:02.500 --> 24:04.639
- COURT. SOME SORT
OF LAWSUIT.

24:04.670 --> 24:05.967
- WHAT KIND OF SUIT?

24:06.010 --> 24:07.363
- I BELIEVE
IT WAS WRONGFUL DEATH,

24:07.410 --> 24:08.968
SOMETHING
IN ONE OF OUR FACTORIES.

24:09.010 --> 24:11.046
- YOU STILL CARE FOR HER
VERY DEEPLY, DON'T YOU?

24:11.080 --> 24:12.877
- YES, THAT'S CORRECT.

24:12.910 --> 24:14.775
- IT WAS HIS WIFE.

24:14.820 --> 24:16.845
- YES. YES,
I BELIEVE IT WAS.

24:16.880 --> 24:18.347
AS I RECALL, WE SETTLED.

24:18.390 --> 24:20.017
- AND YOU DON'T KNOW
HIS NAME?

24:20.050 --> 24:21.859
- WELL, I SPEND
A LOT OF TIME IN COURT.

24:21.890 --> 24:23.187
IT'S THE NATURE
OF MY POSITION.

24:23.220 --> 24:25.427
- ALL RIGHT. O'HARA,
LET'S GET ON ANYBODY

24:25.460 --> 24:26.859
WHO MAY HAVE HAD
ANY COURT BATTLES

24:26.890 --> 24:28.426
WITH MR. BONAVENTU RE'S
COMPANY.

24:28.460 --> 24:31.258
AND, MR. BONAVENTURE,
I CANNOT EXPRESS WITH WORDS

24:31.300 --> 24:33.029
THE HORROR
OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS.

24:33.070 --> 24:35.493
MEMBERS OF OUR CONSULTING TEAM
BEING INVOLVED IS A SHOCK,

24:35.540 --> 24:38.100
AND THIS WILL BE DEALT WITH
FOR THE FUTURE.

24:38.140 --> 24:40.165
YOU OBVIOUSLY
HAVE OUR FULL COOPERATION.

24:40.210 --> 24:41.234
IF YOU INSIST ON KEEPING

24:41.280 --> 24:42.679
YOUR PUBLIC APPEARANCE
THIS EVENING,

24:42.710 --> 24:44.940
WE WILL PROVIDE
A FULL SECURITY DETAIL.

24:44.980 --> 24:46.607
- ACTUALLY, THIS MAN
IS THE ONLY ONE

24:46.650 --> 24:48.379
WHO SUCCESSFULLY
PROTECTED ME THIS WEEK.

24:48.420 --> 24:49.569
HE SAVED MY LIFE.

24:49.620 --> 24:50.712
- HE ALSO
PUT YOUR LIFE IN DANGER.

24:50.750 --> 24:51.944
- WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?
- TURNABOUT.

24:51.990 --> 24:53.184
- SHH!

24:53.220 --> 24:54.983
SO AS I UNDERSTAND IT,
THE SUSPECT

24:55.020 --> 24:56.851
OFFERED ALL OF YOU
$8,500 A DAY,

24:56.890 --> 24:59.120
WITH THE EXCEPTION
OF MR. BOYD WHO RECEIVED 9,500.

24:59.160 --> 25:01.253
- WHOA! HOW COME
YOU GOT MORE?

25:01.300 --> 25:02.619
- YEAH. HE TELLS THE FUTURE.

25:02.660 --> 25:04.969
- ALL YOU'VE TOLD US
IS THE PLOT TO DIE HARD 3.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.218
- YEAH, AND THAT ISN'T
DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN?

25:07.270 --> 25:09.534
- CALM DOWN.
MAYBE IT WAS 8,500.

25:09.570 --> 25:11.231
I TOOK THE JOB.
IT WASN'T ABOUT THE MONEY.

25:11.270 --> 25:12.430
- LET IT GO, GENTLEMEN.

25:12.470 --> 25:13.630
THE CHECK
DIDN'T EVEN CLEAR.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.602
- WHAT?
THIS IS A TOTAL DISASTER.

25:15.640 --> 25:17.801
NOW WE GOT NOTHIN'.
- THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY TRUE.

25:17.850 --> 25:20.171
WE GOT THIS DOPE
NBA AIR HORN.

25:20.210 --> 25:21.848
[air horn blaring]

25:21.880 --> 25:25.543
- STOP SCREWING AROUND!

25:25.590 --> 25:27.649
I WILL BE RUNNING POINT ON
THIS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

25:27.690 --> 25:30.284
- ACTUALLY, I WANT
MR. SPENCER TO WORK POINT...

25:30.320 --> 25:31.355
WITH MY TEAM.

25:31.390 --> 25:33.278
- YES! YES!

25:33.330 --> 25:34.524
FEEL THAT!

25:34.560 --> 25:37.427
- THAT IS
A VERY BAD DECISION.

25:37.460 --> 25:39.223
- I DON'T MAKE BAD DECISIONS,

25:39.270 --> 25:42.433
AND YOUR PARTICIPATION
IS ENTIRELY MY CALL.

25:42.470 --> 25:44.665
MR. SPENCER IS MY CHOICE.

25:44.710 --> 25:46.632
- AHEM. WELL...

25:46.670 --> 25:48.069
- WELL WHAT, LASSIE?

25:48.110 --> 25:49.475
- WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

25:52.810 --> 25:54.516
- THIS WAS WAY MORE FUN
A MOMENT AGO.

25:54.550 --> 25:56.438
- IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

25:56.480 --> 25:57.686
- OF COURSE,
I HAVE AN IDEA.

25:57.720 --> 26:02.180
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO...

26:02.220 --> 26:05.053
IS REASSEMBLE
THE THINK TANK.

26:13.400 --> 26:14.628
- ALL RIGHT, FIRST OF ALL,
LET ME JUST SAY

26:14.670 --> 26:16.968
THAT THIS IS VERY,
VERY EXCITING FOR ME.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.809
I LIKE TO DO THINGS
A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY,

26:18.840 --> 26:21.206
SO NO ONE WILL CALL ME
MR. SPENCER.

26:21.240 --> 26:22.730
IT'S SHAWN.

26:22.780 --> 26:25.601
SHAWNY IF YOU'RE
FEELING A LITTLE LOOSE.

26:25.650 --> 26:28.369
NEVER THE SHAWN DOG,
'CAUSE THAT'S JUST LAME,

26:28.420 --> 26:31.810
AND I'VE NEVER BEEN ONE
TO CHASE BALLS.

26:31.850 --> 26:33.818
WE WILL CHECK
OUR EGOS AT THE DOOR,

26:33.860 --> 26:35.009
ALONG WITH OUR WATCHES,

26:35.060 --> 26:37.858
BECAUSE TIME
DOES NOT EXIST IN THIS ROOM.

26:37.890 --> 26:39.551
SO LET'S SEE 'EM.

26:39.590 --> 26:40.625
WATCHES DOWN.

26:40.660 --> 26:43.254
COME ON.
TAKE 'EM OFF.

26:43.300 --> 26:45.666
MEANS YOU, TOO, STOLTZ.
LET'S DO IT.

26:45.700 --> 26:47.065
VERY NICE.

26:47.100 --> 26:48.192
I LIKE IT.

26:48.240 --> 26:50.629
NOW, WHAT DO WE KNOW?

26:50.670 --> 26:52.865
WE KNOW THAT BONAVENTURE
WILL NOT BUDGE ON HIS PLANS.

26:52.910 --> 26:55.208
WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE KILLER
IS VERY DETERMINED.

26:55.240 --> 26:56.901
BONNY BOOM-BOOM'S
GONNA TAKE THE STAGE

26:56.940 --> 26:59.204
FOR HIS SHAREHOLDERS SPEECH
AT EXACTLY 7:20 PM.

26:59.250 --> 27:00.808
THAT GIVES US...

27:04.590 --> 27:07.286
WATCHES ON.

27:07.320 --> 27:09.618
NO, WAIT. NO.
I CAN JUST...

27:09.660 --> 27:11.355
MAKE OUT THE CLOCK
FROM HERE.

27:11.390 --> 27:13.051
IS IT 3:00?
IS IT 2:00?

27:13.090 --> 27:14.318
IS THAT A CLOCK?
- SHAWN!

27:17.030 --> 27:19.225
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
FORGET IT.

27:19.270 --> 27:21.329
LET'S OPEN THINGS
UP TO THE ROOM, SHALL WE?

27:21.370 --> 27:22.928
- FINALLY.

27:22.970 --> 27:25.109
- I COULD SEE
TWO CLEAR WEAKN ESSES,

27:25.140 --> 27:26.402
HERE AND HERE.

27:26.440 --> 27:29.102
- THREE. NOW OPEN UP
YOUR EARLOBES.

27:29.140 --> 27:30.368
I WILL ELABORATE.

27:30.410 --> 27:33.174
NUMBER ONE, LOCATION
AND ITS SUSCEPTIBILITY

27:33.210 --> 27:34.211
TO PENETRATION.

27:34.250 --> 27:36.275
- HA!

27:36.320 --> 27:38.811
SHE...YOU...

27:38.850 --> 27:43.014
- ERECT STRUCTURES MUST DEFEND
EXTERNAL FORCES,

27:43.060 --> 27:45.483
NOT ONLY PHYSICALLY,
BUT ALSO PSYCHOLOGICALLY.

27:45.530 --> 27:47.157
- GUYS, WE NEED TO THINK
OUTSIDE OF THE BOX.

27:47.190 --> 27:49.454
WHAT IS THIS? ANYBODY?

27:49.500 --> 27:50.455
- A LOW-FAT MUFFIN?

27:50.500 --> 27:51.569
- NO!

27:51.600 --> 27:53.329
THE SPEECH
WILL BE GIVEN HERE

27:53.370 --> 27:55.065
IN THE EMPIRE BALLROOM.

27:55.100 --> 27:57.398
WE WILL KEEP
A SECURE HOLDING AREA

27:57.440 --> 28:01.399
THAT IS CONNECTED SOLELY
BY THIS SERVICE CORRIDOR.

28:01.440 --> 28:04.102
I SENSE THAT ONCE
HE IS ON THE PEDESTAL,

28:04.150 --> 28:06.801
THIS AREA WILL BE SAFE.

28:08.880 --> 28:11.587
QUESTION, BIG BEAR?

28:11.620 --> 28:13.349
- STOP CALLIN' ME THAT.

28:13.390 --> 28:15.551
- OKAY. I'LL HAVE TO COME UP
WITH A NEW CODE NAME.

28:15.590 --> 28:17.615
LITTLE BEAR CERTAINLY
ISN'T GONNA DO THE TRICK.

28:17.660 --> 28:19.321
- YOU'RE WASTIN'
ALL THESE UNIFORMS

28:19.360 --> 28:20.486
AGAINST THIS BACK WALL.

28:20.530 --> 28:22.418
YOU LEAVE
THE POINTS OF ACCESS,

28:22.460 --> 28:24.098
THE DOORS, THE WINGS,
MORE OPEN.

28:24.130 --> 28:26.598
SEE, THIS WALL
ACTS AS YOUR BARRIER.

28:26.630 --> 28:28.439
GOTTA MAKE THESE COPS
MORE USEFUL.

28:28.470 --> 28:29.869
- OH, THEY
WILL BE MORE USEFUL.

28:29.900 --> 28:31.868
I'M GONNA HAVE THEM THINKING
OF CHRISTMAS PRESENT IDEAS

28:31.910 --> 28:33.036
WHILE THEY WAIT,

28:33.070 --> 28:36.233
AND GIFT CERTIFICATES
WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED.

28:36.280 --> 28:38.248
NO? OKAY THEN,
IT'S SETTLED.

28:38.280 --> 28:41.716
WE WILL PUT OUR DEFENSES HERE
IN THE FRONT.

28:41.750 --> 28:42.944
- CHIEF,
THIS IS JUST STUPID.

28:42.980 --> 28:44.345
HE DOESN'T LET

28:44.390 --> 28:46.244
THE SENIOR RANKING MEMBER
ON THIS FORCE IN THAT ROOM?

28:46.290 --> 28:48.155
- LOOK, YOU'VE GOT YOUR TEAM,
HE'S GOT HIS.

28:48.190 --> 28:50.317
WE PUT MR. BONAVENTURE
INTO THIS POSITION.

28:50.360 --> 28:51.588
IT'S OUR JOB TO GET HIM OUT.

28:51.630 --> 28:53.996
- CHIEF?

28:54.030 --> 28:56.851
WE HAVE A PLAN.

29:09.380 --> 29:11.541
- STAND BY THE DOOR?
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

29:11.580 --> 29:13.571
SO I'M ESSENTIALLY
A SECURITY GUARD IN YOUR PLAN.

29:13.610 --> 29:14.645
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

29:14.680 --> 29:15.977
YOU ARE KEVIN COSTNER
IN THIS PLAN.

29:16.020 --> 29:17.317
YOU'RE IN CHARGE
OF THE ENTIRE AUDIENCE.

29:17.350 --> 29:19.113
- I SHOULD BE
WITH BONAVENTURE.

29:19.150 --> 29:20.959
- I BROUGHT THAT UP.
HE FINDS YOU UNSETTLING.

29:20.990 --> 29:22.389
- HE MENTIONED ME?

29:22.420 --> 29:24.456
- YES. HE ALSO SAID
YOU WERE CREEPY,

29:24.490 --> 29:25.821
BUT HE DID MENTION YOU.

29:25.860 --> 29:27.919
- BY NAME?
- HE CALLED YOU "LAZENBY."

29:27.960 --> 29:29.222
- COME ON, CARLTON,
WE'RE FINE.

29:29.260 --> 29:30.693
IT'S NOT ABOUT
WHO GETS WHAT TITLE.

29:30.730 --> 29:31.765
THE MAN'S LIFE IS AT STAKE.

29:31.800 --> 29:33.028
- YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
ISN'T IMPORTANT?

29:33.070 --> 29:34.662
THAT FACT THAT I'M ADDING
A SURPRISE ELEMENT

29:34.700 --> 29:36.588
THE SECOND
THAT I OPEN THIS DOOR.

29:36.640 --> 29:39.302
- WAIT A MINUTE. SPENCER!
WHAT SURPRISE ELEMENT?

29:39.340 --> 29:41.433
- PARDON ME?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,

29:41.480 --> 29:42.674
SURPRISE ELEMENT?

29:42.710 --> 29:45.770
- MR. BONAVENTURE, WE HAVE BEEN
PLAYING FROM BEHIND

29:45.810 --> 29:47.448
THIS WHOLE TIME.

29:47.480 --> 29:49.573
IT IS NOW
THAT I WILL USE THIS,

29:49.620 --> 29:51.110
ZZZZ!

29:51.150 --> 29:52.185
- YOUR FINGER?

29:52.220 --> 29:53.482
- MY GIFT.

29:53.520 --> 29:55.408
SOMEONE KNEW YOUR ROUTE
TOO WELL.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.314
I BELIEVE THERE'S A MOLE
ON YOUR OWN TEAM.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.453
- MY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
WITH ME FOR TEN YEARS.

29:59.490 --> 30:01.128
- GOOD, THEY SHOULD BE
USED TO THE UNEXPECTED.

30:01.160 --> 30:02.388
- SHAWN,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

30:02.430 --> 30:04.125
- WE'RE GOING
ON THE OFFENSIVE, GUS.

30:04.170 --> 30:05.865
YOU ARE SET
TO TAKE THE STAGE AT 7:20.

30:05.900 --> 30:08.391
THAT MEANS THAT--
DADGUMMIT.

30:08.440 --> 30:10.795
YOU HAVE A WATCH ON,
'CAUSE I FORGOT TO PUT--

30:10.840 --> 30:13.400
- OH, CHOP CHOP, GENTLEMEN.

30:13.440 --> 30:14.930
I'M ON IN FIVE MINUTES.

30:14.980 --> 30:17.130
- NOT...

30:17.180 --> 30:18.943
EXACTLY.

30:18.980 --> 30:20.049
- WHAT?

30:20.080 --> 30:22.139
- THE ONLY THING
IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE

30:22.180 --> 30:23.374
THAT YOUR ATTACKER
KNOWS FOR CERTAIN

30:23.420 --> 30:25.638
IS THAT YOU WILL TAKE
THE PODIUM AT 7:20 PM.

30:25.690 --> 30:27.180
HE WILL HAVE TO BE
IN POSITION,

30:27.220 --> 30:29.188
WHICH MEANS HE WILL BE
AT HIS MOST VULNERABLE,

30:29.220 --> 30:31.620
A VERITABLE SITTING DUCK
IF WE CAN FIND HIM,

30:31.660 --> 30:34.925
AND I. . .ZZZZZSSS!

30:34.960 --> 30:36.552
WILL FIND HIM.

30:36.600 --> 30:38.090
I WILL BE ABLE
TO SENSE HIM,

30:38.130 --> 30:41.566
AND I WILL MOST LIKELY
BE ABLE TO SEE HIM.

30:41.600 --> 30:44.068
- AND HOW WILL YOU DO THAT?

30:44.110 --> 30:45.998
- I WILL GO ON FIRST, SIR.

30:47.880 --> 30:50.132
- WHAT, ON? WHERE?

30:50.180 --> 30:51.169
- THE PODIUM.

30:51.210 --> 30:53.349
I WILL STALL
FOR AS LONG AS IT TAKES,

30:53.380 --> 30:55.519
SENSING THE CROWD,
SMELLING THEM,

30:55.550 --> 30:56.744
ANYTHING OUT OF PLACE,

30:56.780 --> 30:58.941
THEN THE COPS AND YOUR TEAM
WILL SUSS HIM OUT,

30:58.990 --> 31:00.343
AND YOU WILL FOLLOW.

31:00.390 --> 31:03.211
- NO, NO, NO, NO,
THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.

31:03.260 --> 31:05.353
- ZZZZZSSS!

31:05.390 --> 31:06.789
- HAND TO THE HEAD,
NOT WORKING.

31:06.830 --> 31:09.424
- I KNOW, THAT'S WHY
I'VE BEEN ADDING SOUND EFFECTS.

31:09.460 --> 31:11.564
MR. BONAVENTU RE,

31:11.600 --> 31:12.965
I KNOW HOW THIS
IS GOING TO END,

31:13.000 --> 31:15.491
AND I AM THE ONLY ONE THAT
CAN OFFER YOU THAT GUARANTEE.

31:15.540 --> 31:16.689
HAVE I BEEN WRONG YET?

31:16.740 --> 31:17.798
- WELL,
THERE WAS THE MAID,

31:17.840 --> 31:19.102
THE GARDENER, THE BABY.

31:19.140 --> 31:20.129
- WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

31:20.170 --> 31:21.569
- I DON'T KNOW.
SYMMETRY?

31:21.610 --> 31:23.430
- REGARDLESS,
I'VE GOTTEN YOU THIS FAR.

31:23.480 --> 31:24.799
NOW WHAT DO YOU VALUE MORE,

31:24.850 --> 31:27.307
YOUR LIFE OR A SLIGHT DELAY
IN YOUR SPEECH?

31:28.980 --> 31:31.642
[applause]

31:35.620 --> 31:37.850
SHAREHOLDERS,
BOARD MEMBERS,

31:37.890 --> 31:39.653
MEMBERS OF THE PRESS,

31:39.690 --> 31:42.295
ATTRACTIVE BUSINESSWOMEN
WITH YOUR SPIKY HEELS

31:42.330 --> 31:44.662
AND YOUR ANKLE TATTOOS.

31:44.700 --> 31:45.860
[chuckles]

31:45.900 --> 31:47.720
RAISE YOUR HAND
IF YOU VACUUM TOPLESS

31:47.770 --> 31:51.262
TO CARLY SIMON.
I'M KIDDING.

31:51.310 --> 31:52.834
[chuckles] WELCOME.

31:52.870 --> 31:54.633
WELCOME, ALL OF YOU.

31:54.680 --> 31:58.605
MY NAME IS SHAWN,
AND I AM THE OPENING ACT, JACK!

31:58.650 --> 32:00.242
[applause]

32:00.280 --> 32:02.510
I APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE

32:02.550 --> 32:04.814
IF I COMPLETELY
BLOW YOUR MINDS.

32:07.020 --> 32:08.681
[whispering]
THERE'S A MAN UP...

32:11.490 --> 32:13.924
FALSE ALARM.

32:13.960 --> 32:16.849
I AM HERE TO SAY...

32:16.900 --> 32:18.663
THAT GREED...

32:18.700 --> 32:20.998
FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD,

32:21.040 --> 32:22.359
IS GOOD.

32:22.400 --> 32:25.198
IT'S RIGHT.
GREED WORKS.

32:25.240 --> 32:28.004
GREED FOR LIFE, FOR MONEY,
FOR LOVE,

32:28.040 --> 32:30.304
FOR FLAN.

32:30.340 --> 32:34.174
WHAT IS SYNERGY?

32:34.220 --> 32:35.869
- WHAT IS HE DOING?

32:35.920 --> 32:37.717
- I REALLY HAVE
NO IDEA,

32:37.750 --> 32:39.411
BUT YOU HAVE
TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE.

32:39.450 --> 32:42.214
I THINK. MAYBE.

32:42.260 --> 32:43.215
LASSITER?

32:43.260 --> 32:44.750
- WHAT THE HELL
IS HE DOING?

32:44.790 --> 32:46.087
- I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT.

32:46.130 --> 32:47.757
- LOOK, I'M GONNA GET
YOU GUYS AN EYEBALL,

32:47.790 --> 32:50.759
SO WOULD YOU JUST CALM
YOUR ASSES DOWN?

32:52.030 --> 32:55.363
ABOUT STOCK SPLITS?

32:55.400 --> 32:58.699
BECAUSE WE'RE JUST GONNA
KEEP SPLITTING STOCKS, PEOPLE,

32:58.740 --> 33:00.731
AND IF THE STOCK
DON'T SPLIT,

33:00.770 --> 33:02.374
YOU MUST ACQUIT.

33:11.720 --> 33:12.880
EXCUSE ME.

33:12.920 --> 33:14.854
AHEM. I'M GETTING
A VERY STRONG VIBE.

33:14.890 --> 33:15.959
CHECK THE AIR VENTS.

33:15.990 --> 33:17.810
- STAY UP THERE, SHAWN.
GIVE US A MINUTE.

33:21.930 --> 33:23.898
- INSTEAD...

33:23.930 --> 33:25.591
LET'S TALK
ABOUT THE FUTURE.

33:36.080 --> 33:38.674
THE TRUE TRAGEDY
IS THAT WE ARE A PART

33:38.710 --> 33:40.746
OF THE MOST TECHNOLOGICALLY
ADVANCED COMPANY

33:40.780 --> 33:42.338
IN ALL OF CALIFORNIA,

33:42.380 --> 33:45.543
AND YET, I WALKED UP
ONTO THIS STAGE,

33:45.590 --> 33:48.912
WHEN WE ALL KNOW,
I SHOULD HAVE FLOWN

33:48.960 --> 33:50.814
VIA JET PACK.

33:50.860 --> 33:52.259
WHO'S WITH ME?

33:55.230 --> 33:56.219
- CLEAR.

33:56.260 --> 33:58.069
- ARE MY SHNDC'JS ELECTRIC?

33:58.100 --> 34:00.193
DOES MY PILLOW
COMB MY HAIR AT NIGHT

34:00.230 --> 34:01.891
WHILE I AM SLEEPING?

34:01.940 --> 34:04.204
NO! SADLY, IT DOES NOT.

34:04.240 --> 34:05.366
AND WHERE, I ASK YOU,

34:05.410 --> 34:07.037
IS THE HOVERBOARD
TECH NOLOGY

34:07.070 --> 34:09.504
THAT WE ALL SAW
IN BACK TO THE FUTURE II

34:09.540 --> 34:11.508
OVER 20 YEARS AGO?

34:11.550 --> 34:13.040
HOW COME THAT HASN'T
MATERIALIZED?

34:13.080 --> 34:14.877
WELL, WE WILL BE ALLOCATING

34:14.920 --> 34:16.444
A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT
OF OUR RESOURCES

34:16.480 --> 34:18.584
TO MAKING THAT HAPPEN.

34:23.760 --> 34:25.557
- DON'T MOVE!
DROP THE GUN!

34:25.590 --> 34:27.626
- HANDS IN THE AIR!
both: NOW!

34:31.030 --> 34:32.895
- AND THAT'S NOT EVEN
COUNTING

34:32.930 --> 34:33.965
THE TREADMILL
THAT WE ALL SAW

34:34.000 --> 34:35.194
SO BEAUTIFU LLY REALIZED

34:35.240 --> 34:37.697
IN THE OPENING CREDITS
OF THE JETSONS.

34:39.510 --> 34:40.704
- SHAWN, WE GOT HIM.

34:40.740 --> 34:42.332
- WHAT?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

34:42.380 --> 34:43.677
WE GOT HIM?

34:43.710 --> 34:46.076
WE "GOT HIM" GOT HIM?

34:46.110 --> 34:48.214
- GET ME OUT THERE.

34:48.250 --> 34:49.717
BONNY BOOM-BOOM
IS ON THE MOVE.

34:49.750 --> 34:51.741
- AND I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME
WE HAD WEAPONS

34:51.790 --> 34:53.815
THAT WERE DESIGNED
TO KILL ZOMBIES!

34:53.850 --> 34:56.614
[applause]

34:56.660 --> 34:58.252
- THANK YOU,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

34:58.290 --> 35:01.327
WE ARE NOT DOING HOVERCRAFTS,
ALL RIGHT?

35:01.360 --> 35:04.523
AND GREED AND FLAN
ARE ALSO A NO-NO.

35:04.570 --> 35:06.128
[laughter]
NOW THEN.

35:06.970 --> 35:09.131
- PICKED HIM UP
LIKE A U.P.S. MAN,

35:09.170 --> 35:10.762
AND I DON'T THINK
HE WAS GOING DUCK HUNTING.

35:10.800 --> 35:13.633
- OH, YOU BLEW IT
WHEN YOU CHOSE A PSYCHIC.

35:13.670 --> 35:15.479
DIDN'T YOU KNOW
I WOULD PEG YOU?

35:15.510 --> 35:17.000
THAT'S A THING, RIGHT?
PEGGING PEOPLE?

35:17.040 --> 35:18.268
- YES.

35:18.310 --> 35:19.470
- PROBABLY BLOWIN' SMOKE

35:19.510 --> 35:21.216
ABOUT THE TRAMPOLINE
BEING ON ITS WAY TOO.

35:21.250 --> 35:24.048
"ON A FLATBED
FROM ALBUQUERQUE," HE SAYS.

35:24.080 --> 35:25.047
MY ASS!

35:25.090 --> 35:26.512
- I THOUGHT
YOU WERE AN IDIOT.

35:26.550 --> 35:28.415
- WELL,
WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.416
- YOU GOT OUR FREQUENCIES,
IS THAT IT?

35:30.460 --> 35:32.655
- WAIT A SECOND.
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

35:32.690 --> 35:33.827
IF HE HAD OUR FREQUENCY,

35:33.860 --> 35:34.997
HE WOULD HAVE KNOWN
THAT WE WERE ONTO HIM

35:35.030 --> 35:36.156
AND GOT OUT OF HERE
BEFORE YOU CAUGHT HIM.

35:36.200 --> 35:38.464
- HE WASN'T LISTENING
TO US.

35:40.470 --> 35:42.233
LASSIE,
HE HAS A MICROPHONE.

35:42.270 --> 35:44.306
- WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?
WHO'S YOUR PARTNER?

35:44.340 --> 35:47.104
- IF HE HAD A PARTNER, WHY
WOULD HE NEED THE THINK TANK?

35:47.140 --> 35:48.402
- THE ONLY TACTIC HERE

35:48.440 --> 35:50.977
IS TO HAVE THE SECURITY TEAM
LOOK THE OTHER WAY.

35:51.010 --> 35:51.999
- THEY NEEDED IDEAS.

35:52.050 --> 35:53.779
THEY TRIED ONCE BEFORE
AND THEY FAILED.

35:53.810 --> 35:55.038
THE HIT WOMAN
GAVE THEM THE PLAN.

35:55.080 --> 35:56.308
WAIT A MINUTE.

35:56.350 --> 35:57.908
WHICH VENT
DID YOU FIND HIM IN?

35:57.950 --> 35:59.918
- IT WAS THE ONE
OFF THE BACK WALL.

35:59.950 --> 36:01.781
- YOU'RE WASTING
ALL YOUR UNIFORMS HERE

36:01.820 --> 36:02.889
AT THIS BACK WALL.

36:02.920 --> 36:04.057
YOU LEAVE
YOUR ACCESS POINTS,

36:04.090 --> 36:06.388
THE DOORS, THE WINGS,
MORE OPEN.

36:06.430 --> 36:08.398
- I KNOW
WHO WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

36:08.430 --> 36:11.695
BOYD PURPOSELY DIRECTED US
AWAY FROM THE VENTS.

36:11.730 --> 36:13.891
SNOWDEN HAD A MOLE
IN THE ROOM THE WHOLE TIME.

36:13.930 --> 36:15.864
- WHERE DID WE PUT BOYD
ON THE DETAIL?

36:15.900 --> 36:18.403
- UPSTAIRS. I WASN'T ABOUT TO
TRUST SOMEBODY I DIDN'T KNOW.

36:18.440 --> 36:20.761
[cocks gun]
- SPLIT UP.

36:20.810 --> 36:23.802
- BUT ONTO
A MORE SERIOUS SUB--

36:23.840 --> 36:24.977
- OKAY, YOU'RE
OUT OF HERE.

36:25.010 --> 36:26.944
- I'M TRYING TO UNDO
SOME DAMAGE HERE.

36:26.980 --> 36:29.016
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
I INSPIRED THESE PEOPLE.

36:29.050 --> 36:30.608
- I DON'T WANT TO ARGUE
ABOUT IT. JUST GO.

36:30.650 --> 36:31.742
- THERE'S ANOTHER KILLER.

36:31.790 --> 36:33.018
- WHAT?

36:33.050 --> 36:34.586
- YEAH, IN THE BUILDING,
THERE'S TWO OF 'EM.

36:34.620 --> 36:35.814
IT'S A TEAM.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.652
WHOA, WHOA.

36:46.970 --> 36:48.164
LET'S TAKE A LEFT HERE.

36:48.200 --> 36:49.838
IS YOUR
CAR WAITING FOR YOU?

36:49.870 --> 36:51.633
- OF COURSE, IT IS.
WHERE'S MY TEAM?

36:51.670 --> 36:55.231
- GUS IS GETTING THEM.
DON'T WORRY.

36:55.280 --> 36:56.838
- MOVE, MOVE, MOVE, MOVE!
MOVE!

36:56.880 --> 36:58.768
- LOOK OUT!

37:02.520 --> 37:04.169
- SON OF A BITCH!

37:05.650 --> 37:07.789
[dialing phone]

37:07.820 --> 37:09.253
- BOYD'S GONE.

37:09.290 --> 37:10.814
- TO YOUR CAR,
AND WE'RE HOME FREE.

37:15.030 --> 37:17.089
CLEAR! GO!

37:27.440 --> 37:28.407
[tapping partition]

37:28.440 --> 37:30.135
GO, GO, GO!

37:31.580 --> 37:34.105
WHAT'S THE HOLD UP?
[gun cocks]

37:34.150 --> 37:36.243
OH, MAN.

37:37.450 --> 37:39.247
WHAT ARE YOU,
A HIRED GUN?

37:39.290 --> 37:40.484
I GET IT WITH SNOWDEN.

37:40.520 --> 37:41.782
HE WANTED VENGEANCE
FOR HIS WIFE'S DEATH.

37:41.820 --> 37:43.310
BUT YOU, YOU'RE GONNA THROW
EVERYTHING AWAY

37:43.360 --> 37:44.679
FOR ANOTHER MAN'S VENDETTA?

37:44.730 --> 37:46.925
- YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME
FROM THE TRIAL, DO YOU?

37:46.960 --> 37:48.086
- NO.

37:48.130 --> 37:50.325
- SHE WAS MY SISTER.

37:50.360 --> 37:52.396
YOU AND YOUR LAWYERS
DECIDED HER LIFE

37:52.430 --> 37:54.637
WAS WORTH $1.2 MILLION.

37:54.670 --> 37:56.729
"IT'S MORE THAN FAIR."
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID.

37:56.770 --> 37:58.431
- I TRIED TO MAKE AMENDS.

37:58.470 --> 38:00.199
- SHH, SHH. YOU SHOULD
LET ME HANDLE THIS, OKAY?

38:00.240 --> 38:01.707
'CAUSE I HAVE EXPERIENCE
IN THESE SITUATIONS.

38:01.740 --> 38:03.298
- YOU WROTE CHECKS.
THAT'S ALL YOU DID.

38:03.340 --> 38:04.341
WELL, WE TOOK YOUR MONEY,

38:04.380 --> 38:05.904
AND WE PUT IT TOWARDS
MAKING YOU PAY.

38:05.950 --> 38:07.201
IT'S KIND
OF IRONIC, ISN'T IT?

38:07.250 --> 38:08.615
YOU FINANCED
YOUR OWN MURDER.

38:08.650 --> 38:11.448
- LOOK, BOYD, OR WHATEVER
YOUR REAL NAME IS,

38:11.490 --> 38:13.515
I THINK THAT YOU ARE
A VERY SMART MAN.

38:13.550 --> 38:14.881
- WELL, YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

38:14.920 --> 38:17.514
YOU WERE WORTHLESS IN THAT
ROOM AND YOU'RE USELESS NOW.

38:17.560 --> 38:18.527
- I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE

38:18.560 --> 38:20.118
THAN NAME-CALLING
IS BENEATH YOU.

38:20.160 --> 38:21.559
- WHATEVER YOU'RE TRYING,
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.227
I GOT YOUR GUY
LOCKED IN MY SIGHTS,

38:23.260 --> 38:24.659
AND I WILL SHOOT HIM
NO MATTER WHAT.

38:24.700 --> 38:26.019
UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE
THE SECOND VICTIM,

38:26.070 --> 38:27.628
I SUGGEST YOU HOLD
VERY STILL.

38:27.670 --> 38:28.762
- WHO ARE YOU KIDDING, MAN?

38:28.800 --> 38:29.869
IF YOU WERE GONNA
KILL HIM,

38:29.900 --> 38:31.094
YOU WOULD HAVE
SHOT HIM ALREADY.

38:31.140 --> 38:32.402
- THIS IS PERSONAL.

38:32.440 --> 38:35.102
I'M WAITING TO SEE
THE RIGHT LOOK ON HIS FACE.

38:37.510 --> 38:39.444
- OKAY, REMEMBER
WHEN WE WERE IN THE ROOM,

38:39.480 --> 38:41.243
AND I WAS TALKIN'
ABOUT TRAMPOLINES?

38:41.280 --> 38:43.373
WELL, THEY'RE
INCREDIBLY THERAPEUTIC.

38:43.420 --> 38:45.980
SO WHY DON'T YOU AND I
GO FIND OURSELVES A BIG ONE

38:46.020 --> 38:47.544
AND BOUNCE LIKE GENTLEMEN?

38:47.590 --> 38:49.057
- ARE YOU SUICIDAL?
IS THAT IT?

38:49.090 --> 38:50.057
[air horn blaring]

38:50.090 --> 38:51.159
_ AAHI
- MMM'!

38:57.160 --> 38:58.366
- GET OUT OF THE CAR!

38:58.400 --> 39:00.027
- HANDS IN THE AIR!
HANDS IN THE AIR!

39:00.070 --> 39:01.196
[siren wailing]

39:01.230 --> 39:02.492
- GET OUT.

39:02.540 --> 39:03.837
YOU GOT HIM?
- I GOT HIM.

39:03.870 --> 39:05.007
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

39:05.040 --> 39:07.133
LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION.

39:09.880 --> 39:12.701
DO YOU HATE WAKING UP
WITH BED HEAD IN THE MORNINGS?

39:14.210 --> 39:15.541
- WHAT? I CAN'T--

39:15.580 --> 39:16.911
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
NEVER MIND.

39:16.950 --> 39:19.145
IT'S OKAY.

39:24.860 --> 39:26.725
- KAREN, YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT?

39:26.760 --> 39:27.954
- WANTED YOU TO KNOW

39:27.990 --> 39:30.129
THAT I SAW YOU
AT THE PIZZA PLACE.

39:30.160 --> 39:31.468
- WELL, YOU KNOW,

39:31.500 --> 39:33.229
I MISSED
A LOT OF SHAWN'S GAMES

39:33.270 --> 39:34.328
WHEN HE WAS A KID.

39:34.370 --> 39:35.462
I JUST WANT
TO SEE HIM WORK.

39:35.500 --> 39:37.365
- EXACTLY HOW MUCH INPUT
DO YOU HAVE

39:37.400 --> 39:38.799
IN SHAWN'S CASES?

39:38.840 --> 39:39.807
- WELL...

39:39.840 --> 39:41.068
WELL, I...

39:41.110 --> 39:43.533
GET INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS,
I GUESS,

39:43.580 --> 39:45.400
AND THEN HIS, UH...

39:45.450 --> 39:47.406
YOU KNOW, HIS PSYCHIC-NESS,
IT JUST TAKES OVER.

39:49.850 --> 39:51.272
- YOU RETIRED YOUNG,
DIDN'T YOU?

39:51.320 --> 39:52.617
- YEAH, MAYBE A LITTLE.

39:52.650 --> 39:54.481
- AND YOU LIKE BEING INVOLVED
IN THESE CASES?

39:54.520 --> 39:56.249
- I'D BE LYING TO YOU
TO YOU IF I DIDN'T TELL YOU

39:56.290 --> 39:58.554
THAT I STILL GOT A LITTLE BIT
OF FUEL LEFT IN MY TANK.

39:58.590 --> 39:59.887
I DON'T HAVE ANY REGRETS.
I'VE LEARNED THAT.

39:59.930 --> 40:02.057
- DO YOU WANT A JOB?

40:02.100 --> 40:03.727
- WHAT?

40:06.000 --> 40:08.560
- LOOK, WHAT HAPPENED
THIS WEEK IS A MESS,

40:08.600 --> 40:10.192
AND IT CAN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

40:10.240 --> 40:12.868
WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING
FOR QUITE A WHILE

40:12.910 --> 40:15.231
CREATING A NEW POSITION,
A LIAISON OF SORTS,

40:15.280 --> 40:18.875
THAT WOULD OVERSEE
OUR EXTERNAL DIVISIONS.

40:18.910 --> 40:21.401
WORKING WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS,
AGENCIES, OUTSIDE HELP.

40:21.450 --> 40:22.769
- PSYCHICS.

40:22.820 --> 40:25.243
- OUR CONSULTANTS WOULD FALL
UNDER THAT CATEGORY, YES.

40:25.290 --> 40:26.780
- WOW.

40:26.820 --> 40:28.754
- LOOK, DON'T GET ME WRONG.

40:28.790 --> 40:31.008
THE BENEFITS
FAR OUTWEIGH THE COSTS,

40:31.060 --> 40:33.324
BUT YOUR SON HAS TURNED
THIS DEPARTMENT ON ITS HEAD

40:33.360 --> 40:34.725
OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS.

40:34.760 --> 40:36.455
- TRY MY LIFE
OVER THE LAST 30.

40:36.500 --> 40:37.853
- IT WOULDN'T BE
A FULL-TIME POSITION,

40:37.900 --> 40:39.322
JUST PART-TIME,
FEW DAYS A WEEK.

40:39.370 --> 40:40.826
WE COULD DISCUSS
YOUR SCHEDULE.

40:40.870 --> 40:43.430
ALL IT WOULD TAKE
IS JUST A LITTLE CONSIDERATION

40:43.470 --> 40:45.335
ON YOUR PART.

40:48.880 --> 40:50.108
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN, KAREN,

40:50.140 --> 40:51.573
THAT'S A VERY ASTUTE
OBSERVATION,

40:51.610 --> 40:53.544
AND A FASCINATING OFFER,

40:53.580 --> 40:58.142
BUT I THINK
I'M GONNA STAY RETIRED.

41:01.790 --> 41:05.624
AND SAY THANK YOU.

41:05.660 --> 41:08.151
- YOU'RE SURE?

41:19.440 --> 41:20.805
- WHO ARE YOU TALKIN' TO?

41:20.840 --> 41:22.239
- CREDIT CARD COMPANY.

41:22.280 --> 41:24.703
OH, YES, AS I WAS SAYING,

41:24.750 --> 41:26.274
SOMEBODY USED MY CARD

41:26.310 --> 41:27.971
TO PURCHASE
A ZEBRA-STRIPED JACKET.

41:28.010 --> 41:29.170
I WOULD LIKE
THAT CHARGE REMOVED.

41:29.220 --> 41:30.869
- YOU CHARGED
THAT ZEBRA-STRIPED JACKET.

41:30.920 --> 41:31.989
- GUS, I SAID SOMEBODY.

41:32.020 --> 41:33.442
DOESN'T MEAN
IT WASN'T ME.

41:33.490 --> 41:35.879
HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW
THAT SNOWDEN'S CHECK WAS BOGUS?

41:35.920 --> 41:38.252
YES, OF COURSE, I'LL HOLD.

41:38.290 --> 41:39.518
I LOVE HOLDING.

41:39.560 --> 41:40.857
- THERE'S A LESSON
TO BE LEARNED HERE, SHAWN.

41:40.890 --> 41:42.494
DO NOT SPEND
YOUR THINK TANK MONEY

41:42.530 --> 41:44.327
BEFORE YOU KNOW WHETHER
THE THINK TANK IS RUN

41:44.360 --> 41:46.191
BY A VINDICTIVE MURDERER
OR NOT.

41:46.230 --> 41:47.891
- THE REAL LESSON
IS THAT WE NEED TO GET

41:47.930 --> 41:49.636
INTO CORPORATE CONSULTING,
BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE

41:49.670 --> 41:50.989
WE WILL BUILD OUR NEST EGG.

41:51.040 --> 41:52.530
- AND BY NEST EGG YOU MEAN?
- EXACTLY.

41:52.570 --> 41:53.867
A GIANT TRAMPOLINE
FOR THE OFFICE.

41:53.910 --> 41:55.468
- WE'LL NEVER GET
ANOTHER CORPORATE GIG ANYWAY,

41:55.510 --> 41:56.636
SO IT DOESN'T MATTER.

41:56.680 --> 41:58.136
[telephone rings]

41:58.180 --> 42:00.444
- DUDE, WE HAVE TWO LINES?

42:00.480 --> 42:01.913
[rings]

42:01.950 --> 42:03.815
- WHO DO WE KNOW
IN THE BULGARIAN CONSULATE?

42:03.850 --> 42:04.817
[rings]
- OH, THAT'S ME.

42:04.850 --> 42:06.488
HERE. UH, HERE, TRADE.

42:06.520 --> 42:08.681
ANOTHER CONSULTING GIG.

42:08.720 --> 42:10.085
HOLA!

42:10.120 --> 42:11.485
COMO ESTA USTED?

42:11.520 --> 42:13.988
MI LLAMO
ES SHAWNITO RODRIGUEZ.

42:14.030 --> 42:16.851
MI GUSTA BULGARIA

42:16.900 --> 42:19.368
Y TRAMPOLINA GIGANTE!

42:19.400 --> 42:21.129
EXPLOSIANOS.

42:22.970 --> 42:24.335
POR...POR QUE?

42:30.380 --> 42:31.938
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

42:31.980 --> 42:33.902
* THAT I'M NOT TELLING
THE TRUTH *

42:33.950 --> 42:35.110
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

42:35.150 --> 42:36.913
* THEY JUST DON'T HAVE
ANY PROOF *

42:36.950 --> 42:38.508
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

42:38.550 --> 42:40.643
* LEARN HOW TO BEND

42:40.690 --> 42:42.089
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS

42:42.120 --> 42:44.486
* TEND TO PSYCH YOU OUT
IN THE END *

42:44.520 --> 42:46.579
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

42:47.960 --> 42:49.791
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

42:51.300 --> 42:53.291
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

42:54.400 --> 42:57.130
*
