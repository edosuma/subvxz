01:16.994 --> 01:18.996
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

01:19.162 --> 01:21.335
<i>the captain has just turned off
the seat-belt sign.</i>

01:21.498 --> 01:24.001
<i>At this time, you are free
to move about the cabin.</i>

01:35.137 --> 01:36.684
Wine helps.

01:37.055 --> 01:39.353
Hm? Excuse me?

01:40.142 --> 01:42.190
So does Xanax.

01:43.020 --> 01:45.318
I have some in my purse if you want.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.107
Why? Do I seem nervous to you?

01:49.735 --> 01:51.863
Business or pleasure? Your trip.

01:52.029 --> 01:56.034
Excuse me, sir? Is that your leather
carry-on in the overhead compartment?

01:56.199 --> 01:57.917
Probably, yeah.

01:58.076 --> 01:59.453
Do you need me to move it?

01:59.620 --> 02:02.419
- If you don't mind.
- Sure.

02:06.251 --> 02:07.798
I don't mind.

02:09.211 --> 02:12.307
Sure. Sorry, pardon me.
No, don't get up. Don't get up.

02:12.466 --> 02:13.683
- Are you sure? Okay.
- Yeah.

02:13.842 --> 02:16.140
Got it, thank you. Excuse me.

02:19.598 --> 02:22.226
- Would you mind holding that?
- Oh, sure, thanks.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.444
May I help you?

02:32.069 --> 02:34.618
Okay, put it in. Put it in.

02:34.863 --> 02:37.616
Whoa, ha, ha! That was a big one.

02:37.783 --> 02:41.538
All right. Do you...? Don't you think we
should probably go back to our seats?

02:41.703 --> 02:43.250
No, it's okay. Just give it to me.

02:43.455 --> 02:46.504
<i>Good morning.
We've hit a nasty patch of weather...</i>

02:46.667 --> 02:48.715
<i>as we approach Chicago.
Please take your seats.</i>

02:48.877 --> 02:51.221
- Shut the fuck up, Carl.
- Captain says we should return...

02:51.380 --> 02:53.007
Don't worry about anything.

02:53.382 --> 02:54.634
Oh!

02:54.800 --> 02:57.428
Oh, God. You really are scared,
aren't you?

02:57.594 --> 03:01.394
Well, yeah.
All right, just give me a minute.

03:01.556 --> 03:04.685
- It's okay.
- Honey, don't worry about anything.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.945
Ladies and gentlemen...

03:07.104 --> 03:08.777
- Those seat belts are not gonna help you.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.441
Nothing out there can help you.

03:10.816 --> 03:12.864
If we go down, we go down.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.905
<i>We ask you to return to your seats.</i>

03:16.071 --> 03:17.789
So you might as well fuck me.

03:17.948 --> 03:22.454
Okay, concentrate and then fuck me.

03:23.495 --> 03:26.669
Look at my tits. Does that help?

03:28.625 --> 03:30.468
<i>Her tits did help.</i>

03:31.336 --> 03:32.588
Ah!

03:33.839 --> 03:36.012
<i>But I couldn't get the thought
out of my head...</i>

03:36.174 --> 03:39.849
<i>- Yeah.
- ...that at any moment, at any place...</i>

03:40.011 --> 03:42.059
<i>it could all come crashing down.</i>

03:42.222 --> 03:43.474
<i>Charlie, I'm home.</i>

03:44.266 --> 03:45.609
They didn't have the...

03:45.767 --> 03:47.735
The canned plum tomatoes
that you wanted...

03:47.894 --> 03:51.489
so, ha, I got the fresh ones-
Fresh ones instead.

03:51.648 --> 03:55.243
Hey, baby.
This lovely lady came looking for you.

03:55.485 --> 03:56.953
Aw.
Heh, heh.

03:57.904 --> 04:00.077
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:08.457 --> 04:11.961
- Are you her other hooker?
- Get the fuck out of here.

04:12.127 --> 04:14.129
Sandee, how can I help you?

04:14.296 --> 04:16.048
Okay, look, now, I'll just say it.

04:16.214 --> 04:18.558
Lenore... I mean, she's a bitch.

04:18.716 --> 04:20.935
- I'm so sorry about my language.
- It's okay.

04:21.094 --> 04:24.473
But, I mean, she is a fucking cunt.
And we'd like to try something new...

04:24.639 --> 04:27.267
maybe work for you guys.

04:27.809 --> 04:31.439
You want me to pimp your fiancé?

04:31.605 --> 04:32.777
Yes.

04:33.482 --> 04:37.032
That is a very interesting proposal,
isn't it, Tanya?

04:37.194 --> 04:41.119
Sandee, I will certainly consider
your offer.

04:41.656 --> 04:47.334
However, I am just not currently
in the market for additional gigolos.

04:47.496 --> 04:48.873
Will he do dudes?

04:50.457 --> 04:52.425
- What?
- Your fiancé.

04:52.876 --> 04:54.378
Will he fuck men?

04:57.756 --> 04:59.850
Yes, I think that can be arranged.

05:05.222 --> 05:06.644
Hey.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.059
What are you doing here?

05:09.226 --> 05:11.479
- We're moving in.
- How'd you get in the house?

05:11.645 --> 05:14.068
There was a key under the rock
by the door.

05:14.231 --> 05:16.325
- Did you go somewhere?
- On a business trip.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.736
- How long have you...?
- We got here this morning.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.620
Mom is pissed.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.329
<i>This is why they shouldn't
have their own car.</i>

05:25.492 --> 05:27.745
They can't just come and go
whenever they please.

05:27.911 --> 05:30.209
They're kids, Jess.
Let them blow off some steam.

05:30.372 --> 05:32.249
You know? Let them stay the weekend.

05:32.415 --> 05:34.543
I don't want them to stay the weekend.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.258
I want them to come back.

05:39.965 --> 05:42.059
<i>'Keg, just when you feast expect it</i>

05:42.217 --> 05:44.219
<i>the whole thing comes crashing down.</i>

05:44.386 --> 05:46.184
They won't be very happy.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.723
I don't care if they're happy.

05:47.889 --> 05:50.642
Do they strike you as particularly
happy people in general?

05:50.809 --> 05:53.813
You have got to support me on this,
even if you don't agree.

05:55.063 --> 05:57.862
Ray, you can't let them
play us against each other.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.992
- Jess?
- Oh, God. Ray.

06:00.151 --> 06:02.870
Yeah. Jess, let me call you back.

06:03.738 --> 06:04.785
<i>Ow.</i>

06:05.198 --> 06:09.624
Hey, guys, did you see anything...

06:09.786 --> 06:12.960
like out of the ordinary
when you came in?

06:13.123 --> 06:14.716
You left the TV on.

06:18.253 --> 06:20.506
Huh? The back door is unlocked.

06:21.965 --> 06:24.468
Hey, Mrs. Koontz. Yael?

06:24.843 --> 06:28.347
Yael, did you see anybody suspicious
come into my home?

06:28.513 --> 06:32.689
- Anybody at all?
- I don't pay attention to your visitors, Ray.

06:32.851 --> 06:36.196
- I have better things to do.
- Okay, so nothing strange?

06:36.354 --> 06:38.982
No break-ins?

06:41.401 --> 06:46.248
I think 69-ing on the dock is strange, Ray,
but what do I know?

06:46.406 --> 06:49.034
Oh, you had a break-in. Tsk. Low.

06:51.119 --> 06:55.169
Maybe it was the lady with the crazy hair
who's always yelling.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.417
- All right.
- Maybe it was the cop...

06:57.584 --> 07:00.258
who arrested you in front
of my house last week.

07:01.171 --> 07:04.220
Maybe it was the redhead
who liked to walk around in the nude.

07:04.382 --> 07:06.259
Miss Fire-Crotch, right?

07:06.426 --> 07:07.928
Okay, thanks.

07:10.513 --> 07:13.312
Hey. Hi, Ray.
- Tanya, my shoebox is gone.

07:13.475 --> 07:16.103
My money that I keep in my shoebox,
somebody took it.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.363
Ray, you keep your money in a shoebox?

07:18.521 --> 07:20.489
Yeah, it was hidden. Don't laugh.

07:20.649 --> 07:23.653
- Banks can go belly-up.
- Yeah, and houses burn down, Ray.

07:23.818 --> 07:26.537
It's not the smartest move in the world.

07:28.698 --> 07:32.373
- Oh, God. How much did they get?
- Five grand.

07:32.535 --> 07:34.788
You know, that has Lenore
written all over it.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.378
Tanya, who are you talking to?

07:37.540 --> 07:39.759
Who's that? ls somebody with you?

07:39.918 --> 07:41.340
<i>- What?
- Is somebody with you?</i>

07:41.503 --> 07:43.176
No, it's no one.

07:43.338 --> 07:45.682
It's my friend. It's my friend.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.810
<i>- Okay. Well...
- Look, let's just go find Lenore.</i>

07:48.969 --> 07:51.267
I'll see you in half an hour.

07:51.429 --> 07:52.806
Oh, God.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.396
What?

07:56.142 --> 07:59.897
- Ray's money was stolen.
- You gonna sign up that other dude?

08:00.063 --> 08:01.440
Jason? No.

08:01.606 --> 08:04.029
Look, Ray and I have
a unique business relationship.

08:04.192 --> 08:06.490
- And he's worth it. All right?
- All right.

08:06.653 --> 08:10.283
Well, if you're not gonna take him,
I might make a move.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.963
You... You want to be Jason's pimp?

08:17.539 --> 08:20.292
Yeah, if you don't.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.427
It's money on the ﬂoor.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.434
I gotta go.

08:37.933 --> 08:40.528
- Is Lenore here?
- Foot massage?

08:41.688 --> 08:45.238
No, no, we need Lenore Bernard.

08:45.984 --> 08:48.954
Don't do that here. Just massage.

08:49.112 --> 08:51.786
- I think...
- No, no, she lives here.

08:51.948 --> 08:54.918
It's... It's Lenore.

08:55.452 --> 08:59.252
Lenore Bernard? She's tall, red hair.

08:59.414 --> 09:00.757
Red hair?

09:11.718 --> 09:13.595
Redhead gone.

09:14.471 --> 09:15.688
What?

09:21.770 --> 09:23.613
Hey, do you really think
that she would...?

09:23.772 --> 09:26.525
No, Ray. No.
She's too much of a narcissist.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.193
She's never gonna kill herself.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.905
I don't know.
What do we really know about her?

09:32.072 --> 09:33.494
We know nothing.

09:34.157 --> 09:37.752
Listen, a certain business opportunity
has presented itself.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.709
- What opportunity?
- Well, I don't know.

09:39.871 --> 09:43.250
I think it has enormous growth potential
and it could boost our earnings.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.589
- What is it?
- Sandee came to see me yesterday.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.049
Jason's fiancée.

09:47.212 --> 09:49.635
- Jason being...
- Exactly.

09:49.798 --> 09:53.473
And she was investigating
the possibility of us teaming up.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.017
On the DL.
Like, Lenore wouldn't know about it.

09:57.180 --> 09:59.854
We'd bring Jason on
as an additional consultant...

10:00.016 --> 10:03.520
and then take a percentage.
You know, kind of like a merger.

10:04.312 --> 10:06.235
Are you fricking kidding me?

10:06.397 --> 10:08.195
Well, no. I mean...

10:08.358 --> 10:09.655
I don't know. Maybe.

10:09.818 --> 10:12.446
- My money is missing, Tanya.
- I thought it could be good.

10:12.612 --> 10:16.037
I am suddenly broke and you want
to talk to me about this now?

10:16.199 --> 10:19.453
I'm sorry. It was a bad time.
I'm sorry I brought it up.

10:19.619 --> 10:20.916
It wasn't the right time.

10:21.079 --> 10:23.582
- I'll say.
- Never mind. It's fine.

10:27.544 --> 10:31.640
Lisa, I want you to put the bottle down
Did you put it dawn?

10:31.923 --> 10:34.426
Getting your stomach pumped is awful,
Lisa.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.970
You get all barf};
And your mouth tastes like chalk.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.606
Does Lenore Bernard work here?

10:39.764 --> 10:43.644
I don't think so.
Do you mean Lenore Russell?

10:43.810 --> 10:45.562
- There she is.
- Sir?

10:45.728 --> 10:48.026
- Is she expecting you?
- Why lake a whole bottle...

10:48.189 --> 10:51.659
when you can take a couple,
drink a martini and feel fantastic?

10:51.818 --> 10:53.035
Think about it.

10:53.194 --> 10:55.492
Okay, buzz me if you crater.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.703
We don't do walk-ins, Ray.
You got to call.

10:57.866 --> 11:00.210
Oh, yeah? They actually let you
work in this place?

11:00.368 --> 11:02.791
It's volunteer.
I'm giving back to my community.

11:02.954 --> 11:06.003
People who are gonna kill themselves,
they wanna talk to me first.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.339
Look at you, all sexy.

11:08.501 --> 11:11.550
- It's good to see you again, Ray.
- Where's my shoebox, Lenore?

11:12.463 --> 11:13.885
Are you coming onto me?

11:14.048 --> 11:15.766
Look, I know you did it.

11:15.925 --> 11:18.474
Okay? I probably have witnesses,
so give it back.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.809
I have no idea
what you're talking about, Ray.

11:22.265 --> 11:25.565
Stacy, is your garage door open?

11:25.727 --> 11:27.149
Open your garage door.

11:27.312 --> 11:29.656
Did you break into my house...

11:29.814 --> 11:32.067
and steal my shoebox full of money?

11:32.233 --> 11:34.577
Stace, hold on a sec.
Ray, you're an asshole.

11:34.736 --> 11:37.285
I am dealing here with people
with real problems, okay?

11:37.447 --> 11:40.496
All you have is a big dick
and a missing shoebox.

11:40.658 --> 11:42.752
And right now I don't care about either.

11:42.911 --> 11:46.586
I have better things to do with my time
than creep around your burnt-out house.

11:46.748 --> 11:48.421
I'm trying to save lives.

11:49.292 --> 11:53.172
Stacy? Sweetheart, did you open the door?
Please open the door.

11:53.963 --> 11:56.637
Open the door and turn the engine off.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.313
No. Okay.

12:16.444 --> 12:17.912
You need a jump?

12:18.446 --> 12:20.289
Oh, no, that's...

12:20.740 --> 12:22.834
That's okay. I got it.

12:22.992 --> 12:24.414
Yeah, I can see that.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.842
- I'm Kyla.
- I'm Ray.

12:39.008 --> 12:42.137
I know. I asked Lenore about you.

12:42.303 --> 12:46.228
She told me, you know, your deal.

12:46.391 --> 12:48.610
- My deal?
- Yeah.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.983
So how does it work?

12:52.188 --> 12:53.815
How does what work?

12:53.982 --> 12:59.113
Is there someone I'm supposed to call
to set things up?

13:00.697 --> 13:02.495
You can talk to me.

13:03.658 --> 13:05.410
Doctor's office.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.586
Hm. Uh-huh.

13:11.499 --> 13:14.048
Patsy, great job on that blood work.

13:14.711 --> 13:16.759
Knocked it out of the park. A-plus.

13:17.422 --> 13:20.972
Jessica. Could I speak to you privately
for a minute?

13:31.311 --> 13:32.904
Have a seat.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.023
That's okay.

13:35.189 --> 13:36.782
Listen, Jessica.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.911
What happened the other night was...

13:40.486 --> 13:42.659
Brought some things
to the surface for me.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.371
I thought we weren't gonna
talk about that here.

13:45.533 --> 13:48.912
See, I've had box seats at Tiger Stadium
for 10 years.

13:49.078 --> 13:52.002
And every game I get two hot dogs.
Mustard, relish.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.338
- Okay.
- And then they built the new stadium...

13:54.500 --> 13:56.047
and I got the corporate box.

13:56.210 --> 13:58.929
And the first game,
they brought me filet mignon.

13:59.088 --> 14:02.809
And it was delicious...
I mean, juicy and succulent.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.514
But what happened?

14:05.386 --> 14:07.354
I missed the dogs.

14:10.683 --> 14:13.482
Mindy and I are gonna
try to work things out.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.698
You don't have to tell me this, Matt.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.655
- It's... It's fine.
- I do.

14:19.817 --> 14:22.991
I do, because I'm happy
with you working here.

14:23.279 --> 14:25.498
I love your office presence.

14:25.656 --> 14:28.830
Thank you. I hope it's nice.

14:28.993 --> 14:32.714
But Mindy,
she's not that happy about it.

14:32.955 --> 14:34.798
You told Mindy about us?

14:34.957 --> 14:36.959
In the spirit of honesty.

14:39.545 --> 14:42.389
Matt, are you firing me?

14:42.548 --> 14:44.596
What? No.

14:44.759 --> 14:47.979
Because of some sexual relationship
we may or may not have had?

14:48.137 --> 14:50.310
That is out of the question.

14:50.473 --> 14:51.599
Okay.

14:51.766 --> 14:55.862
I have always said
your job is totally intact.

14:58.439 --> 15:00.237
That is, if you want it to be.

15:00.400 --> 15:03.779
But if you feel uncomfortable...

15:03.945 --> 15:06.118
no hard feelings.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.889
<i>The kicking shoebox.</i>

15:31.973 --> 15:33.520
<i>If Lenore didn't take it, who did?</i>

15:35.601 --> 15:38.400
<i>I was saving all that money
to take my kids on a college trip.</i>

15:43.067 --> 15:48.824
<i>Living in a land
That's built on diesel fuel and clay</i>

15:49.866 --> 15:54.622
<i>We fight to see the stars
And live another day</i>

15:56.622 --> 15:57.965
What?

15:58.416 --> 15:59.668
<i>Yet you might see</i>

16:00.001 --> 16:01.969
All right, I'll come around.

16:03.004 --> 16:08.261
<i>A revolution brewing in the 313</i>

16:10.219 --> 16:14.190
<i>Too many vacancies
And hungry mouths to feed</i>

16:15.808 --> 16:18.561
<i>The country watches as our...</i>

16:18.769 --> 16:20.612
Why don't you call like a normal person?

16:20.771 --> 16:22.773
You never call.
Anyway, this is important.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.362
I have an idea: a mixer.

16:24.525 --> 16:27.119
We should get to know them
before you make up your mind.

16:27.278 --> 16:29.497
- Hang outwith who?
- Sandee and Jason.

16:29.655 --> 16:32.408
I think you should rethink them.

16:33.242 --> 16:35.961
You're unbelievable, Tanya.
I already said no.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.463
Just drop it.

16:37.622 --> 16:39.420
Look, I want this business to grow.

16:39.582 --> 16:42.005
- I want to merge.
- Well, I don't.

16:42.168 --> 16:45.263
Well, that's like poor people who say
they're Republican...

16:45.421 --> 16:47.674
then they vote against
their own self-interests.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.763
Just think about us for a change, please?

16:49.926 --> 16:52.475
Oh, I am.
And I don't think they're good for us.

16:52.637 --> 16:54.856
No, you don't think
it's a good idea for you.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.733
But Jason is a very good idea for us.

16:57.892 --> 17:00.395
Jason is gonna make
a lot of money, Ray.

17:00.561 --> 17:02.234
I mean, he'll have sex with anyone.

17:02.396 --> 17:04.944
He'll have sex with guys.
I mean, he's full-service.

17:05.107 --> 17:06.450
Jason... He's good to go.

17:07.944 --> 17:10.663
Hope the three of you
are very happy together.

17:12.656 --> 17:15.285
You know, Charlie says
I don't need your approval.

17:15.451 --> 17:18.876
Who cares what you think?
He says this is a great opportunity...

17:19.038 --> 17:22.133
and that I should go for it.
And that's what I'm gonna do.

17:22.833 --> 17:25.803
- Who's Charlie?
- What?

17:25.962 --> 17:27.589
Who the hell is Charlie?

17:28.881 --> 17:31.259
My... My... My...

17:31.717 --> 17:33.435
My boyfriend.

17:36.973 --> 17:38.975
<i>Boyfriend?</i>

17:39.141 --> 17:41.940
<i>Now some joker was giving her
business advice.</i>

18:04.917 --> 18:06.385
Tanya ain't around.

18:07.962 --> 18:10.306
- Are you...?
- Am I what?

18:10.965 --> 18:13.969
- You're Charlie.
- Yeah.

18:14.677 --> 18:16.224
What can I do for you, man?

18:17.388 --> 18:20.483
- You got a minute?
- Sure.

18:26.772 --> 18:29.901
Hey, you wanna taste this for me?

18:30.067 --> 18:34.117
Listen, Charlie, I don't know
what's going on between you and Tanya.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.282
It's none of my business
and I don't care.

18:36.449 --> 18:39.919
But what's going on
between me and Tanya...

18:40.077 --> 18:42.421
you see, that's none of your business.

18:42.580 --> 18:43.581
Heh, heh, heh.

18:43.748 --> 18:44.795
What?

18:44.957 --> 18:47.756
Oh, look, man,
you don't want me in your business.

18:47.918 --> 18:51.513
I respect that.
But the problem is Tanya.

18:53.007 --> 18:54.634
She kind of makes it my business.

18:54.800 --> 18:58.850
And we both know that her judgment
is kind of hazy when it comes to you.

18:59.013 --> 19:03.109
So when she comes to me all upset
about the shit that you pull...

19:03.267 --> 19:05.690
telling her to blow away
a business opportunity...

19:05.853 --> 19:08.572
and coming whining to her
like some kind of baby bitch?

19:08.731 --> 19:11.200
Hey, buddy, all due respect...

19:11.359 --> 19:13.828
what the fuck are you talking about?

19:13.986 --> 19:17.331
- You're holding her back, Ray.
- I'm what?

19:17.990 --> 19:20.413
You're a stubborn, middle-age ho
who don't do dudes.

19:20.576 --> 19:23.420
Come on. You wanna listen up
and just let the truth permeate?

19:23.579 --> 19:27.925
Because this ain't about you.
It's about dollars and cents.

19:28.084 --> 19:32.510
You got to open yourself
to the economics of the situation.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.265
Okay. Got it.

19:34.423 --> 19:36.425
Your dick got an expiration date, Ray.

19:39.679 --> 19:42.478
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow...

19:42.640 --> 19:44.108
but sometime.

19:44.266 --> 19:46.985
And the smart move
would be to think ahead...

19:47.144 --> 19:51.741
maybe see this Jason kid
as your 401.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.151
Huh?

20:00.866 --> 20:03.085
You're a vampire. You're a vampire.

20:03.244 --> 20:05.087
You're, um, Robert Pattinson.

20:05.246 --> 20:07.590
Uh, uh, Taylor Lautner. Twilight.

20:07.748 --> 20:10.467
No. Ian Somerhalder. Help me out.

20:10.626 --> 20:12.299
Buff?"

20:12.461 --> 20:13.963
- Time! Time.
- What are you?

20:14.130 --> 20:17.304
Dracula. I was Dracula.
The vampire.

20:19.844 --> 20:23.894
He's the first one. The first vampire.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.353
The first...

20:26.308 --> 20:28.652
Okay, it's my turn. I don't know this one.

20:28.811 --> 20:30.859
Skip it.
- I don't know this one.

20:31.021 --> 20:32.694
- Skip it.
- I don't know that one.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.405
- I don't know this one either.
- Sandee, skip it.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.991
- Easy, tiger.
- No, I know this one. Here.

20:38.154 --> 20:40.907
- Okay.
- You didn't know those other ones?

20:41.073 --> 20:42.791
- I'm ready.
- Ready...

20:42.950 --> 20:44.952
- Yeah.
- Go!

20:47.329 --> 20:50.173
- Ke$ha. You're Ke$ha!
- Mike Tyson. Janet Jackson.

20:50.332 --> 20:52.630
- Madonna.
- Britney Spears. Christina Aguilera.

20:52.793 --> 20:55.137
<i>Me and the Mickey Mouse Club.</i>

20:55.296 --> 20:57.640
<i>- The dawn of a new age.
- Oh, my God.</i>

20:57.798 --> 21:00.267
- I'm so old.
- Katy Perry?

21:00.426 --> 21:04.147
Backstreet Boy... Michael Jackson.
Justin Timberlake?

21:04.305 --> 21:06.182
Kelly Clarkson. Kanye West.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.066
- I'm sorry.
- Beyoncé.

21:08.225 --> 21:13.072
I didn't want to do this without you,
but we have to adapt. We have to try.

21:13.230 --> 21:14.948
No?
- It's okay.

21:15.107 --> 21:17.906
Okay. Britney Spears.
- It's okay?

21:18.068 --> 21:20.742
- It's okay.
- Tito Jackson. The Jackson 5.

21:20.905 --> 21:23.283
- Yep.
- Um... Beyoncé.

21:23.699 --> 21:25.372
<i>Glee! Glee! Beyoncé.</i>

21:25.743 --> 21:27.711
They got a lot of energy.

21:27.870 --> 21:29.497
Yeah, I'll give them that. Yeah.

21:29.663 --> 21:30.880
Super pumped, man.

21:32.917 --> 21:35.761
- Awesome!
- I want first dibs...

21:35.920 --> 21:38.343
and I want 20 percent of everything
the kid makes.

21:38.506 --> 21:40.099
- Okay, deal.
- '80s boy bands.

21:40.257 --> 21:41.634
Ray, you wanna play?

21:41.801 --> 21:44.429
Good move. I don't know who it is.
- No.

21:44.595 --> 21:46.142
I... I gotta go.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.808
I meant to tell you,
I found a new client.

21:48.974 --> 21:51.102
You set up a date?

21:51.268 --> 21:55.023
Yeah, when I was fixing my car.

21:55.189 --> 21:57.942
I think it's gonna be good.
I'll give you the details later.

21:58.108 --> 22:00.110
Okay, that's great, Ray.

22:00.277 --> 22:03.281
Kelly Clarkson?
- You know you're living with a pimp, right?

22:03.447 --> 22:05.370
- Yeah, I know.
- Okay.

22:06.116 --> 22:08.164
I don't know.

22:10.996 --> 22:13.090
Okay, here we go. Yes.

22:13.249 --> 22:14.626
Okay.

22:14.834 --> 22:18.509
That's good, that's good.
Rodeo. Rodeo.

22:18.671 --> 22:21.220
Rodeo. You got it, you got it.

22:21.382 --> 22:23.555
Come on, head rush, head rush.

22:23.717 --> 22:25.435
Double dig them with a swing step.

22:25.594 --> 22:27.892
Okay, good, good.
All right, swing step out.

22:28.055 --> 22:30.399
Round it out. Round it out.

22:30.558 --> 22:32.606
Round it out. Whoo! Tap front.

22:32.768 --> 22:34.486
Tap front. Tap front.

22:34.645 --> 22:37.239
Infection. You've got it.
That's it, that's it. Whoo!

22:37.398 --> 22:39.696
<i>Everybody, dance!</i>

22:44.864 --> 22:46.457
Whoa! Ha, ha, ha!

22:52.955 --> 22:55.583
Okay, that's it.

22:55.749 --> 22:58.093
- Enough.
- Just when you were getting good.

22:58.252 --> 23:00.050
Yeah, fantastic.

23:00.212 --> 23:01.759
I mean it.

23:02.506 --> 23:04.099
Oh!

23:05.342 --> 23:07.015
I'm glad your car broke down.

23:07.177 --> 23:08.599
Me too.

23:09.889 --> 23:13.519
And I'm really glad
you wanted to do this.

23:13.684 --> 23:16.938
Yeah, I know. This is... This is great.

23:18.147 --> 23:20.241
This is what I do.

23:49.428 --> 23:52.272
Nice shoes, T-Brain.
- What are you doing here?

23:52.431 --> 23:55.105
- I wanted to talk to you.
- Look, what do you want?

23:55.267 --> 23:57.269
Ray came to see me yesterday.

23:57.436 --> 24:00.610
Apparently, someone stole his shoebox
and he thought it was me.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.320
I wonder why he'd think that.

24:02.483 --> 24:07.114
<i>All right, Tanya, as you know, I am now
working with a very talented young gigolo.</i>

24:07.279 --> 24:10.499
But he's got a girlfriend.
I think she stole Ray's money.

24:10.658 --> 24:14.413
All right, well, you'll forgive me
if I don't believe you, Lenore.

24:15.245 --> 24:17.168
Yeah, that's right. Good night.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.309
I almost forgot.
I've been so distracted lately.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.845
Kyla, this new girl
who's on a date with Ray...

24:31.011 --> 24:33.480
she wanted me to tell him,
but I've been so busy.

24:33.639 --> 24:35.937
I didn't even know
if it'd be a problem for him.

24:36.100 --> 24:37.727
All right, what is it?

24:37.893 --> 24:40.442
The woman Ray is on a date with
is a man.

24:41.146 --> 24:42.739
She's a man.

25:12.219 --> 25:14.267
Oh, fuck.

25:15.014 --> 25:17.233
Oh... Ooh...
