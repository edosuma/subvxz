11:16.676 --> 11:18.634

OF A NEW ENGLAND CHILDHOOD

11:18.721 --> 11:20.680
IN THEIR VOICE
DO YOU THINK I'VE MET?

11:20.767 --> 11:23.770
IT WAS A TRICK THEN--
THE COMMENT ABOUT MY MOTHER.

11:23.857 --> 11:25.597
YOU ARE A SLY ONE, MR. JANE.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.687
THIS IS ABOUT YOUR FATHER,
ISN'T IT?

11:27.774 --> 11:31.081
WE'RE NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT THIS.WE CAN TALK ABOUT
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

11:31.168 --> 11:33.388
NO. WE'RE NOT GOING
TO TALK, PERIOD.OKAY.

11:33.475 --> 11:35.956
I KNOW WHAT YOU DO
WHEN YOU TALK TO PEOPLE--

11:36.043 --> 11:38.262
THAT GENTLE HAND ON
THEIR SHOULDER,
THE LONG LOOK...

11:38.349 --> 11:41.657
YOU'RE NOT DOING THAT TO ME.I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

11:41.744 --> 11:43.659
YOU THINK I'M STUPID.NO, I DON'T.

11:43.746 --> 11:47.315
YOU THINK EVERYBODY'S STUPID
EXCEPT FOR YOU. YOU'RE WRONG.NO. NO.

11:47.402 --> 11:50.492
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

11:50.579 --> 11:54.148
I AM GOING TO KILL YOU.

11:54.235 --> 11:58.239

12:47.027 --> 12:49.464

12:49.551 --> 12:52.075

12:52.162 --> 12:54.861

C.H.P. GOT A CALL FROM
A RANCHER OUTSIDE WILTON.

13:08.700 --> 13:12.226
SAYS A WORKER SAW A CAR

A FARMHAND APPROACHED THE CAR.

13:15.098 --> 13:17.535
WILTON? THAT'S SOUTH.
THE WITNESS SAID
HE WAS GOING NORTH.

13:17.622 --> 13:20.321
I'LL GET WILTON P.D.

13:20.408 --> 13:22.323

13:52.222 --> 13:54.224
AREN'T YOU WORKING
JANE'S CASE FILES?

13:54.311 --> 13:57.314
[sighs] LISBON WANTS ME TO GO
THROUGH HIS DESK FIRST.

13:57.401 --> 13:59.621

GETTING US ANYWHERE.

13:59.708 --> 14:02.972

14:03.059 --> 14:05.757
[sighs]
I'LL GET TECH SERVICES

14:05.845 --> 14:09.370
NAH, THAT'LL TAKE TOO LONG.

14:17.334 --> 14:19.815
THANKS.

14:19.902 --> 14:22.905

14:22.992 --> 14:25.429

OKAY.

14:26.648 --> 14:28.824
COUGH DROPS.

14:34.699 --> 14:39.269
WELL, IT FIGURES.
JANE'S NOT GONNA KEEP ANYTHING
IMPORTANT IN THE OFFICE.

14:39.356 --> 14:41.445
WAIT. THERE'S
SOMETHING ELSE IN HERE.

14:41.532 --> 14:43.578
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

14:43.665 --> 14:47.190
IT'S TAPED TO THE TOP
OF THE DRAWER.

14:51.716 --> 14:54.371
[chuckles]

14:57.287 --> 14:59.420

15:23.748 --> 15:25.620
WHO'S LINUS WAGNER?

15:25.707 --> 15:28.710
HE'S THIS CREEPY DOCTOR
THAT JANE PUT AWAY
A COUPLE YEARS AGO.

15:28.797 --> 15:32.627
HE KILLED TWO PEOPLE
AND TRIED TO MAKE IT LOOK
LIKE RED JOHN DID IT.

15:36.457 --> 15:39.373

15:39.460 --> 15:41.201
THIS IS LISBON.

15:41.288 --> 15:43.986
AGENT. DR. LINUS WAGNER.
HOW ARE YOU?

15:44.073 --> 15:45.683
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

15:45.770 --> 15:49.035
I happened to see on the TV
in our recreation area

15:49.122 --> 15:51.776
the announcement
about Patrick Jane.

15:51.863 --> 15:54.431
VERY SORRY TO HEAR IT.
I HOPE HE'S ALRIGHT.

15:54.518 --> 15:57.608
YEAH, I'M SURE. DO YOU HAVE
INFORMATION ABOUT HIM?

15:57.695 --> 16:00.176
Yes. Yes, I think I may.

16:00.263 --> 16:03.266
WHY DON'T YOU COME OUT HERE,
AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT?

16:03.353 --> 16:04.876
JUST TELL ME.

16:04.964 --> 16:09.577
NO. YOU SHOULD COME.

16:09.664 --> 16:11.318
IT'S COMPLICATED.

16:11.405 --> 16:13.146
[line disconnects]

16:17.759 --> 16:19.282
[emergency radio chatter]

16:24.026 --> 16:25.593
MR. MENDOZA?

16:25.680 --> 16:27.377
YEAH?

16:27.464 --> 16:31.381
WAYNE RIGSBY, CBI. YOU CALLED
C.H.P. ABOUT THE CAR?

16:31.468 --> 16:34.732
THAT'S RIGHT.YOU COULD'VE MENTIONED
IT WAS ON FIRE.

16:34.819 --> 16:38.214
W-WELL, IT WASN'T.
NOT--NOT THEN.

16:38.301 --> 16:41.522
ONE OF MY HANDS SAW A CAR
WITH A GUY HOLDING A GUN

16:41.609 --> 16:43.480
SO I CALLED THE COPS.

16:43.567 --> 16:46.570
A LITTLE LATER I SAW SMOKE,
SO I CALLED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.

16:46.657 --> 16:49.660
YOU COULD'VE GIVEN US
A HEADS-UP.WHY? YOU GUYS PUT OUT FIRES?

16:49.747 --> 16:51.967
YOUR GUY GET A LOOK
AT THE DRIVER?

16:52.054 --> 16:55.710
CAN HE GIVE US A DESCRIPTION?NO. UH, HE SAID HE WAS
WEARING A SWEATSHIRT

16:55.797 --> 16:59.409
WITH THE HOOD UP.

16:59.496 --> 17:01.107
THANKS.

17:01.194 --> 17:03.718
I HAVE NOTHING. YOU?

17:03.805 --> 17:05.894
NOPE.
[sighs]

17:05.981 --> 17:09.158
WE GOT CALIFORNIA PLATES.
SECOND THING THE WITNESS
GOT WRONG.

17:09.245 --> 17:10.812
TYPICAL.

17:10.899 --> 17:12.727
LOOK, THEY MUST'VE
BROUGHT JANE HERE

17:12.814 --> 17:15.556
AND SWITCHED TO ANOTHER CAR.

17:15.643 --> 17:17.384
YEP. IT'S STOLEN.

17:17.471 --> 17:18.689
FORENSICS CAN SIFT THE ASHES.

17:18.776 --> 17:21.953
WE SHOULD GET BACK
TO THE OFFICE.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.694
RIGSBY?

17:23.781 --> 17:26.436
WHAT PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE
IS WHEN THEY TORCH A CAR

17:26.523 --> 17:28.482
THE GAS TANK GOES FIRST.

17:28.569 --> 17:30.875
WHOLE THING BURNS
BACK TO FRONT.

17:30.962 --> 17:33.748
SO THE TRUNK GETS INCINERATED,
BUT SOMETIMES...

17:33.835 --> 17:35.880
SOMETIMES STUFF UP FRONT
SURVIVES.

17:35.967 --> 17:38.274
WELL, THE CAR'S STOLEN.
PAPERWORK'S USELESS.

17:38.361 --> 17:40.537
THE GUY WHO TOOK JANE--
HE GOT SHOT, RIGHT?

17:40.624 --> 17:42.844
SO HE'S DRIVING,
AND HE'S BLEEDING.

17:42.931 --> 17:45.151
HE'S LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
TO PUT ON THE WOUND.

17:45.238 --> 17:47.892
WHAT DO PEOPLE DO WHEN THEY'RE
DRIVING AND LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING

17:47.979 --> 17:50.460
IN THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT?

17:54.682 --> 17:58.251
THIS...
WE TAKE TO FORENSICS.

17:58.338 --> 18:01.428
AH. A FINGERPRINT.
NO NEED. HOLD IT UP.

18:01.515 --> 18:03.430
WHY?

18:03.517 --> 18:06.215
BUREAU TECHS CAN SCAN
THE IMAGE INTO A.F.I.S.

18:06.302 --> 18:10.350
IF HE'S IN THE SYSTEM, WE'LL
HAVE AN I.D. IN TEN MINUTES.NICE CATCH.

18:11.742 --> 18:13.353
YEAH.

18:13.440 --> 18:15.790
THANKS.

18:15.877 --> 18:18.793
[Van Pelt]
THE PRINT RIGSBY FOUND
MATCHES A GUY NAMED FRED KITTEL

18:18.880 --> 18:20.664
A THUG OUT OF YUBA CITY.

18:20.751 --> 18:23.580
ARRESTS FOR ASSAULT, ARMED
ROBBERY, AND ATTEMPTED MURDER.

18:23.667 --> 18:27.410
WHERE'S THE JANE CONNECTION?CAN'T SEE ONE. HE WASN'T
INVOLVED IN ANY OF JANE'S CASES

18:27.497 --> 18:29.412
AND HE'S NEVER BEEN QUESTIONED
BY THE CBI.

18:29.499 --> 18:31.588
SO VERY LIKELY
HE'S A HIRED HAND.

18:31.675 --> 18:33.155
SOMEBODY CHECKING
HIS RESIDENCE?

18:33.242 --> 18:35.984
YUBA CITY P.D. WENT.
SAY IT'S EMPTY, STRIPPED.

18:36.071 --> 18:37.768
THEY'RE CIRCULATING HIS PICTURE.OKAY.

18:37.855 --> 18:40.902
CHECK HIS FAMILY, RUNNING
BUDDIES, CELLMATES, EMPLOYERS.

18:40.989 --> 18:43.426
THERE'S GOTTA BE
A CONNECTION.

18:56.918 --> 18:58.615
[keys jangle]

19:00.356 --> 19:02.445
THANK YOU.

19:04.186 --> 19:06.580
THANK YOU FOR MAKING
THE TRIP, AGENT.

19:06.667 --> 19:09.148
WHY AM I HERE, WAGNER?

19:09.235 --> 19:10.932
[chuckles]

19:11.019 --> 19:12.934
I DO HOPE WE CAN BE CORDIAL.

19:13.021 --> 19:16.416
WHAT'S THE INFORMATION?

19:16.503 --> 19:20.594
I'VE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH
THE PERSON BEHIND
JANE'S DISAPPEARANCE.

19:20.681 --> 19:23.292
WHO'S THAT?

19:23.379 --> 19:26.077
FIRST THINGS FIRST.

19:26.165 --> 19:30.212
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

19:30.299 --> 19:32.736
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE
KEPT UP WITH MY TRIAL.

19:32.823 --> 19:37.263
IT WAS LONG
AND... TEDIOUS.

19:37.350 --> 19:39.656
UNFORTUNATELY, IT CONCLUDED
WITH MY CONVICTION

19:39.743 --> 19:41.441
ON TWO COUNTS
OF FIRST-DEGREE MURDER.

19:41.528 --> 19:44.879
SO... THE DEATH PENALTY
IS AN OPTION.

19:44.966 --> 19:46.097
THAT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.969
[chuckles]

19:48.056 --> 19:50.450
SENTENCING IS
IN A FEW WEEKS.

19:50.537 --> 19:51.755
THE JUDGE MIGHT BE CONVINCED

19:51.842 --> 19:55.455
TO CHOOSE SOMETHING...
LESSER.

19:55.542 --> 19:58.588
LIFE IN PRISON,
SAY...

19:58.675 --> 20:00.764
PREFERABLE,
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW

20:00.851 --> 20:06.466
BUT I NEED PEOPLE
TO TESTIFY ON MY BEHALF

20:06.553 --> 20:08.642
TO ASK FOR CLEMENCY.

20:08.729 --> 20:11.688
AND WHO BETTER
THAN A CBI AGENT?

20:11.775 --> 20:15.736
CLEMENCY?
ON WHAT POSSIBLE GROUNDS?

20:18.782 --> 20:20.306
FOR COMPASSION'S SAKE

20:20.393 --> 20:23.091
AND... AND...

20:23.178 --> 20:26.007
HUMANITY...

20:26.094 --> 20:28.488
MORE THAN ANY
PARTICULAR PERSONAL WORTH

20:28.575 --> 20:30.794
I MIGHT HAVE.

20:30.881 --> 20:33.101
ALTHOUGH I DID DO
A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD

20:33.188 --> 20:35.886
IN MY TIME, AS YOU KNOW.
THERE ARE VILLAGES IN AFRICA--

20:35.973 --> 20:38.715
YOU KILLED
AND MUTILATED TWO PEOPLE.

20:38.802 --> 20:41.022
I'M AWARE OF THAT.

20:42.589 --> 20:44.634
[cell door clanks in distance]

20:46.810 --> 20:48.334
IF YOU HELP US WITH JANE

20:48.421 --> 20:51.380
WE CAN HELP MAKE YOUR LIFE
EASIER IN HERE.

20:51.467 --> 20:53.687
AGENT, I'M ABOUT TO BE PUT
ON DEATH ROW.

20:53.774 --> 20:58.692
DO YOU REALLY THINK
I CARE ABOUT EXTRA SOAP
AND CHEESEBURGERS?

21:01.521 --> 21:06.047
YOUR FRIEND JANE
IS VERY CLEVER

21:06.134 --> 21:07.701
BUT I DON'T THINK
HE REALIZES

21:07.788 --> 21:11.270
THE RAGEFUL FEELINGS
HIS TRICKERY CAN PROVOKE.

21:12.532 --> 21:15.796
I'VE FELT THAT RAGE.

21:15.883 --> 21:18.451
I'VE THOUGHT OF
VARIOUS UNPLEASANT THINGS

21:18.538 --> 21:21.410
I WOULD DO TO HIM...

21:21.497 --> 21:23.717
AND RIGHT NOW SOMEONE
IS ACTING

21:23.804 --> 21:27.503
ON THOUGHTS LIKE THOSE.

21:27.590 --> 21:32.334
AREN'T YOU WORRIED
WHAT'S BEING DONE TO HIM?

21:32.421 --> 21:34.249
THERE ARE THINGS
SO MUCH WORSE

21:34.336 --> 21:36.904
THAN KILLING A MAN.

21:38.558 --> 21:40.211
YOU CAN GO TO HELL.

21:40.299 --> 21:44.303
AND WHEN THEY KILL YOU,
I'M GONNA BE THERE TO WATCH.

21:46.957 --> 21:49.525
COME ON.

22:03.670 --> 22:05.628
[cell door clanks in distance]

22:07.804 --> 22:08.892
[door squeaks]

22:13.288 --> 22:14.594
[door clanks shut]

22:18.598 --> 22:20.991
I WILL TELL THEM
THAT YOU HELPED ON A CASE

22:21.078 --> 22:22.819
AND ASK FOR CLEMENCY

22:22.906 --> 22:27.128
BUT ONLY IF YOUR INFORMATION
BRINGS JANE BACK ALIVE.

22:27.215 --> 22:28.347
I DON'T CONTROL THAT.

22:28.434 --> 22:30.436
I DON'T CARE.

22:40.010 --> 22:43.100
I'VE DONE A LOT OF WRITING
IN HERE.

22:43.187 --> 22:46.495
THE BOUNTIFUL FREE TIME.

22:46.582 --> 22:48.279
A WHILE BACK,
I PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE

22:48.367 --> 22:50.456
IN AN ONLINE JOURNAL
ABOUT EMOTIONAL TRAUMA

22:50.543 --> 22:53.023
AND ITS EFFECT
ON THE PSYCHE.

22:53.110 --> 22:56.418
IT INCLUDED
SOME OBSERVATIONS ON JANE.

22:56.505 --> 22:58.159
NOT LONG AFTER

22:58.246 --> 23:01.205
I GOT A LETTER FROM
A YOUNG WOMAN WHO CLAIMED

23:01.292 --> 23:03.991
TO BE A GRADUATE STUDENT
IN PSYCHOLOGY.

23:04.078 --> 23:07.168
SHE SAID
SHE WAS RESEARCHING JANE

23:07.255 --> 23:10.040
BUT SHE DIDN'T KNOW A LICK
ABOUT PSYCHOLOGY.

23:10.127 --> 23:11.955
SHE WAS, HOWEVER...

23:12.042 --> 23:15.611
OBSESSED WITH JANE...

23:15.698 --> 23:18.309
AND EXCEEDINGLY HOSTILE
TOWARD HIM.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.137
WHAT'S HER NAME?

23:25.447 --> 23:28.842
YOU, UH...

23:28.929 --> 23:31.801
YOU PLANNING ON DOING
ANYTHING ABOUT HIM?

23:31.888 --> 23:33.716
NO.

23:36.719 --> 23:39.069
THAT'S NOT VERY HYGIENIC.

23:39.156 --> 23:41.376
MAYBE YOU CAN JUST
SHOVE HIM IN THE CORNER

23:41.463 --> 23:44.423
BEFORE HE STARTS TO SMELL.
I MEAN, I'D DO IT MYSELF, BUT...

23:44.510 --> 23:46.468
NO.

23:46.555 --> 23:48.383
FINE.

23:48.470 --> 23:51.299
THAT SMELL GETS IN YOUR DRAPES,
YOU'RE NEVER GETTING IT OUT.

23:51.386 --> 23:53.388
YOU THINK
EVERYTHING'S FUNNY.

23:53.475 --> 23:55.477
JUST THE FUNNY THINGS.

23:55.564 --> 23:58.219
YOU NEVER FEEL GUILTY,
DO YOU?

23:58.306 --> 24:02.223
I FEEL GUILTY EVERY MINUTE
OF EVERY DAY.

24:02.310 --> 24:03.442
SEE?

24:03.529 --> 24:05.269
YOU DID IT.

24:05.356 --> 24:08.490
YOU GOT ME TALKING AGAIN,
TRYING TO MESS WITH MY MIND.

24:08.577 --> 24:11.188
IT'S ABUSIVE, WHAT YOU DO.

24:11.275 --> 24:13.103
YOU USE PEOPLE...

24:13.190 --> 24:16.237
LIKE TOYS.

24:16.324 --> 24:19.196
NO THOUGHT
FOR THE DAMAGE YOU DO

24:19.283 --> 24:21.634
THE PEOPLE YOU HURT.

24:21.721 --> 24:22.983
I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

24:23.070 --> 24:24.854
MAYBE YOU THINK YOU ARE.I AM.

24:24.941 --> 24:26.508
NO, YOU'RE NOT YET.

24:29.642 --> 24:33.167
YOU WILL BE.

24:33.254 --> 24:36.170
YOU EVER SEE A RANCHER USE
A CATTLE PROD?[electricity crackles]

24:36.257 --> 24:38.041
NO. NO, RACHEL.

24:38.128 --> 24:39.826
CATTLE CAN BE STUBBORN.

24:39.913 --> 24:43.220
TAKES A REAL JOLT
TO GET THEM GOING.

24:43.307 --> 24:45.440
IT MUST HURT.[crackles]

24:45.527 --> 24:48.704
YOU'LL HAVE
TO LET ME KNOW.

24:51.098 --> 24:52.882
NO.

24:52.969 --> 24:54.057
[crackling]

24:58.584 --> 25:00.673
SO WAGNER SAYS
SHERRY WINGER WAS AFTER JANE--

25:00.760 --> 25:04.677
THE GIRL WHO WAS THE WITNESS? I
THOUGHT C.H.P. CHECKED HER OUT.

25:04.764 --> 25:06.940
NOW THEY'RE SAYING THE LICENSE
AND REGISTRATION ARE FAKES--

25:07.027 --> 25:08.724
TOP DOLLAR FORGERIES.

25:08.811 --> 25:11.814
THEY NEVER WOULD'VE CAUGHT IT IF
THEY HADN'T TAKEN A SECOND LOOK.

25:11.901 --> 25:15.209
DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA
WHO OR WHERESHERRY WINGER IS?

25:15.296 --> 25:18.560
NO. THE ONLY THING WE KNOW
FOR SURE IS THAT SHE HATED JANE.

25:18.647 --> 25:21.345
LINUS GAVE ME COPIES OF
THE LETTERS SHE WROTE TO HIM.

25:21.432 --> 25:24.435
I GAVE THE ORIGINALS
TO FORENSICS SO THEY
COULD RUN THE PAPER.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.960
WHY WOULD SHE SHOW UP
AT THE SCENE?

25:27.047 --> 25:31.181
MISDIRECTION. SHE GIVES US
THE WRONG LICENSE PLATE--
WE HEAD NORTH INSTEAD OF SOUTH.

25:31.268 --> 25:33.923
BOSS, I'VE READ SOMETHING ELSE
WRITTEN BY THIS PERSON.YOU SURE?

25:34.010 --> 25:35.969
YEAH, THERE ARE PHRASES
THAT I'VE SEEN BEFORE.

25:36.056 --> 25:37.884
THIS ONE CALLS JANE
A COYOTE-LIKE TRICKSTER

25:37.971 --> 25:39.973
AND IN ONE OF THESE...

25:44.760 --> 25:48.416
WHERE... HERE.

25:48.503 --> 25:51.637
IN THIS ONE, CALLS JANE
A TRICKSTER, A COYOTE.

25:51.724 --> 25:54.422
WHO WROTE THAT LETTER?IT'S FROM THE DAUGHTER
OF DON BOWMAN.

25:54.509 --> 25:57.294
GET A COPY
OF SHERRY WINGER'S LICENSE.

25:57.381 --> 25:58.992
WHO'S DON BOWMAN?

25:59.079 --> 26:01.472
CASE FROM THREE YEARS AGO.
INSURANCE COMPANY EXECUTIVE.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.779
HE WAS WRITING FAKE POLICIES
AND CASHING THEM IN.

26:03.866 --> 26:06.565
COMPANY AUDITOR FOUND OUT,
SO BOWMAN KILLED HIM.

26:06.652 --> 26:08.958
THAT'S BOWMAN.AND JANE PUT HIM AWAY?

26:09.045 --> 26:10.830
HE HAD A DAUGHTER--
RACHEL, 19.

26:10.917 --> 26:14.094
HE WAS A SINGLE FATHER.
SHE IDOLIZED HIM. HE ADORED HER.

26:14.181 --> 26:17.010
OKAY.JANE FORGES A LETTER TO BOWMAN
UNDER RACHEL'S NAME

26:17.097 --> 26:19.621
CLAIMING SHE'S DISCOVERED PROOF
THAT HE COMMITTED THE MURDER.

26:19.708 --> 26:22.885
SHE'S DEVASTATED, DOESN'T KNOW
WHETHER TO GO TO THE POLICE
OR KILL HERSELF.

26:22.972 --> 26:24.452
SO BOWMAN RACES TO HIS DAUGHTER.

26:24.539 --> 26:26.759
HE'S SO SORRY.
HE DID IT ALL FOR HER.

26:26.846 --> 26:30.066
SHE NEEDS TO KEEP THE SECRET.AND YOU'RE THERE?
JANE HAS YOU THERE?

26:30.153 --> 26:32.329
WE GOT THE WHOLE CONVERSATION
ON TAPE.

26:32.416 --> 26:35.332
JUST CHECKED.
DON BOWMAN AND FRED KITTEL
WERE BOTH IMPRISONED AT CORCORAN

26:35.419 --> 26:37.030
THAT'S THE CONNECTION.

26:37.117 --> 26:39.032
BUT BOWMAN COULDN'T BE
BEHIND THIS.WHY NOT?

26:39.119 --> 26:42.383
HE'S DEAD. DIED IN PRISON
ABOUT A YEAR AGO.

26:42.470 --> 26:43.906
BOWMAN'S DEAD,
BUT HIS DAUGHTER ISN'T.

26:43.993 --> 26:45.429
IS THAT
THE DRIVER'S LICENSE PICTURE?

26:45.516 --> 26:48.215
MM-HMM.LOOK AT THIS.

26:48.302 --> 26:51.305
LET ME SEE THAT.RACHEL BOWMAN.
SHERRY WINGER.

26:51.392 --> 26:54.613
OOH, MISS RACHEL'S HAD
SOME WORK DONE, BUT THAT'S HER.

26:54.700 --> 26:58.051
GET HER ADDRESS FAST.OKAY.

26:58.138 --> 27:00.967
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT MY FATHER
DIED IN PRISON, DID YOU?

27:01.054 --> 27:02.708
NO.

27:05.188 --> 27:07.451
OF AN INFECTION.

27:07.538 --> 27:10.759
DO YOU KNOW HOW
INCREDIBLY STUPID THAT IS?

27:10.846 --> 27:13.022
SIMPLE ANTIBIOTICS
COULD'VE SAVED HIM...

27:13.109 --> 27:14.937
[chuckles]
BUT A PRISON HOSPITAL--

27:15.024 --> 27:18.071
IT'S--IT'S A NIGHTMARE
IN THERE.

27:18.158 --> 27:22.902
THEY JUST LET HIM DIE
BUT YOUKILLED HIM.

YOUR ANGER IS MISPLACED.

27:46.316 --> 27:48.754
OH, REALLY?

27:48.841 --> 27:50.494
YOU CAN'T BE ANGRY
WITH YOUR FATHER

27:50.581 --> 27:52.975
SO... HERE I AM.

27:53.062 --> 27:56.413
DON'T YOU DARE SAY THAT.
MY FATHER LOVED ME.

27:56.500 --> 28:00.591
HE TOOK CARE OF ME,
PROVIDED FOR ME.
I'M ALL HE EVER CARED ABOUT.

28:00.679 --> 28:04.073
YES, YOU ARE, AND HE WOULDN'T
WANT YOU DOING THIS.

28:04.160 --> 28:08.599
MM. OH, I THINK
HE WOULD BE VERY PROUD.

28:10.427 --> 28:12.212
HE LOVED ME SO MUCH...

28:12.299 --> 28:15.650
AND YOU MADE ME
BETRAY HIM.

28:15.737 --> 28:18.261
WHEN YOU WERE TALKING
TO ME

28:18.348 --> 28:19.828
ASKING ABOUT
ME AND MY DAD...

28:19.915 --> 28:24.050
I THOUGHT THAT
YOU WERE ACTUALLY CONCERNED.

28:24.137 --> 28:27.618
I MEAN, I THOUGHT
THAT YOU LIKED ME.

28:43.199 --> 28:46.333
YOU WANT ME TO BE SORRY?
OKAY. I AM SORRY.

28:49.162 --> 28:53.383
I'M SORRY THAT THE LOSS
OF YOUR FATHER DROVE YOU MAD

28:53.470 --> 28:56.822
BUT I DON'T REGRET
WHAT I DID TO HIM.

28:56.909 --> 29:00.129
HE WAS
A THIEF AND A MURDERER

29:00.216 --> 29:03.567
AND I DID EVERYTHING I COULD
TO CATCH HIM

29:03.654 --> 29:06.353
BECAUSE THAT'S JUST
WHO I AM.
