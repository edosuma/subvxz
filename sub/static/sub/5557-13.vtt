    Last week on "the voice,"   

00:03.538 --> 00:07.239
        The artists' fight      
 to make it to the live shows...

00:07.275 --> 00:08.574
       What is happening?!      

00:08.609 --> 00:10.176

        in the knockouts        

00:12.814 --> 00:14.513
        How people just blossom.

00:14.549 --> 00:15.781
      ¶ as i set fire... ¶

      gonna make the lives      

00:26.127 --> 00:27.259
    That much more exhilarating.

00:27.295 --> 00:28.494
    It's barrett.               
     [ cheers and applause ]

 ...Each used their only steals,

00:44.078 --> 00:45.611
 Fortifying their teams.        

00:45.646 --> 00:46.846
 That's what                    
 i'm talking about!             

00:46.881 --> 00:48.047
 I'm the only coach             
 with a steal left.             

00:48.082 --> 00:50.382
 I'm waiting                    
 for something special.

 For the final spots

 Regina: I'm gonna have to bring
 my "a" game                    

00:58.893 --> 01:02.394
 And nail every single second   
 of this song.                  

01:02.430 --> 01:05.764
   ¶ pay me what you owe me ¶   
   daly: To help prepare them,  
      our coaches recruited     

01:05.800 --> 01:08.901

01:12.340 --> 01:13.539
              Gwen:             
      Rihanna is incredible.    

01:13.574 --> 01:16.575
  She's literally so passionate 
           and genuine          

01:16.611 --> 01:17.810
   Towards all of the artists.  

01:17.845 --> 01:19.078
                Hey, rihanna!   

01:19.113 --> 01:21.480
       She's been amazing.      

01:21.515 --> 01:25.017
That is the sweet spot          
    of your voice.

01:26.354 --> 01:28.420

      To secure their spots,    

01:28.456 --> 01:31.724
The artists will have to deliver
the performances of their lives.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.259
              Bam!              
        Yes!

01:51.779 --> 01:53.112
     This is the knockout round.

01:53.147 --> 01:55.114
 You came out swinging,         
 and you did what you had to do.

01:55.149 --> 01:56.548
You just crushed this.          

01:56.584 --> 01:58.550
             She parted my hair.
          [ laughter ]          

01:58.586 --> 02:01.353
    You should be on the show,  
        but so should <i> you.</i>      

02:01.389 --> 02:03.055
              Daly:             
  And with one steal remaining, 

02:03.090 --> 02:05.658
   There is no room for error.  

02:05.693 --> 02:08.026
      We've got that steal!     
                    Whoa!       

02:08.062 --> 02:10.729
      It's "go live or go home."

02:10.764 --> 02:12.097
That worked out good.           

02:12.133 --> 02:13.332
        Yo, it worked out great.

02:13.367 --> 02:18.203
    Daly: The final knockouts   
         start right now!       

02:18.239 --> 02:19.838
           We're winding it down
                   here.

  Adam: I know, man.            

02:21.008 --> 02:22.174
      How lucky are we, man?    

02:22.209 --> 02:24.009
          Like, we share        
        the same ambitions      

02:24.045 --> 02:25.611
   As the people that we guide  
            and coach.          

02:25.646 --> 02:29.815
  I feel like this might be my  
 favorite thing i've ever done. 
                        Whoa.   

02:29.850 --> 02:31.650
         Is that weird?         
               No, it's awesome.

02:31.686 --> 02:33.519
No, i told you that.            
        You told me that.       

02:33.554 --> 02:35.387
    You're like,                
"what am i getting myself into?"
              yeah.             

02:35.423 --> 02:37.222
And i was like, "trust me,      
you are gonna love it so much." 

02:37.258 --> 02:39.692
And i'm so happy that, like,    
that's what's happening.        

02:39.727 --> 02:41.694
    Daly: As our coaches head   
         to their chairs        

02:41.729 --> 02:43.062
 At universal studios hollywood,

02:43.097 --> 02:45.764
        Let's meet adam's       
       final knockout pair.     

02:45.800 --> 02:48.067
    Adam: James and shelby --   
     my two country singers.    

02:48.102 --> 02:50.002
       I want one person        
to fill this slot at this point.

02:50.037 --> 02:53.238
   It's time to see these guys  
       take the gloves off.     

02:53.274 --> 02:55.107
    You look right              
    in that chair.              

02:55.142 --> 02:56.442
    [ chuckling ]               
   i'm just saying.             

02:56.477 --> 02:58.010
        Rihanna is, like,       
       an incredible coach.     

02:58.045 --> 02:59.278
                     [ giggles ]
      i've worked with her,     

02:59.313 --> 03:00.612
     And i've performed with her
     a bunch of times,          

03:00.648 --> 03:02.081
      And rihanna is fire.      

03:02.116 --> 03:03.649
                    Yeah!       

03:03.684 --> 03:05.050
           Hey, shelby.         

03:05.086 --> 03:06.752
                 Oh, my god.    
              She said my name. 

03:06.787 --> 03:07.753
            [ laughs ]          

03:07.788 --> 03:09.355
       You look beautiful.      
                   Thank you.   

03:09.390 --> 03:11.256
     Shelby:                    
     I was just in complete awe.

03:11.292 --> 03:13.659
It's really cool                
that i get to learn from someone

03:13.694 --> 03:15.060
             As huge as rihanna.

03:15.096 --> 03:16.428
            Are you singing     
            country music today?

03:16.464 --> 03:17.563
                          I am. 
              What?             

03:17.598 --> 03:18.764
        "jesus, take the wheel,"
          by carrie underwood.  

03:18.799 --> 03:20.099
          Ooh. Big song.        

03:20.134 --> 03:22.701
  This is the first country song
      i've sang on the show.    

03:22.737 --> 03:24.636
             Shelby:            
  Before coming on "the voice," 

03:24.672 --> 03:26.205
            I was just          
      a high-school student     

03:26.240 --> 03:29.575
    Singing at a bowling alley  
        in my small town.       

03:29.610 --> 03:31.510
    To be here is so surreal.   

03:31.545 --> 03:34.713
   Going into blinds, i thought 
  that if blake shelton turned, 

03:34.749 --> 03:35.814
     I was going to pick him.   

03:35.850 --> 03:40.886
  ¶ i can't look at the stars ¶ 

03:40.921 --> 03:43.655
         I didn't expect        
       to get four chairs.      

03:43.691 --> 03:45.324
Your song choice suggests       

03:45.359 --> 03:47.593
That you are not strictly       
  a country artist.             

03:47.628 --> 03:48.927
           I pick adam.         

03:48.963 --> 03:51.230
      Having adam as a coach    
  is gonna me more of an outlet 

03:51.265 --> 03:53.532
   To experience other things.  

03:53.567 --> 03:57.469
       Only thing that can get  
      in your way is gonna be...

03:57.505 --> 04:00.105
                        This.   
    Adam is an awesome coach.   

04:00.141 --> 04:03.342
Shelby, thank you for coming    
out here and sassing it up      

04:03.377 --> 04:05.177
And believing in yourself.      
I love to see that from you.    

04:05.212 --> 04:06.645
             Shelby!            

04:06.680 --> 04:10.516
It's so crazy and more exciting 
than i could have ever imagined.

04:10.551 --> 04:16.120
    ¶ jesus, take the wheel ¶   

04:16.156 --> 04:17.822
 This is a pretty personal song.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.858
            I sang it           
 for my third-grade talent show.

04:19.894 --> 04:21.360
             I lost.            

04:21.394 --> 04:24.430
      ¶ oh, i'm letting go ¶    

04:24.465 --> 04:26.732
   So i think this is a chance  
         to redeem myself       

04:26.767 --> 04:28.967
   And showcase my vocal range. 

04:29.003 --> 04:32.304
                Holy smokes,    
            that freaking <i> voice!</i>

04:32.339 --> 04:33.972
            [ laughs ]          

04:34.008 --> 04:37.509
 Shelby has such a perfect voice
    and -- and so much skill.   

04:37.545 --> 04:39.244
      I was very impressed.     

04:39.280 --> 04:40.712
   Can you try this             
  for the last note,            

04:40.748 --> 04:43.148
Before you slow down            
into the "jesus, take           
the wheel" at the end?          

04:43.184 --> 04:45.050
    [ vocalizing ]              

04:45.086 --> 04:46.318
       ¶ jesus,                 
   take the wheel ¶             

04:46.353 --> 04:48.554
        ¶ and this road i'm -- ¶

04:48.589 --> 04:50.022
                 I don't know   
               what i'm doing.  

04:50.057 --> 04:51.790
I'm not even hearing            
      all that.                 
          [ laughter ]          

04:51.826 --> 04:54.827
 You're so good that,           
      literally,                

04:54.862 --> 04:57.496
Your success on the show        
      and beyond                

04:57.531 --> 05:00.032
 Has everything to do           
with how much you believe       

05:00.067 --> 05:01.467
    It can happen.              

05:01.502 --> 05:04.303
Take the nerves, put it all into
getting lost in my performance. 

05:04.338 --> 05:07.005
      That's the star power.    
    That's what it feels like.  

05:07.041 --> 05:09.775
      It's twinkling stars      
        in your stomach.        
     You got it.                

05:09.810 --> 05:13.178
     Shelby's biggest opponent  
     on "the voice" is shelby,  

05:13.214 --> 05:15.614
     And i'm trying to make her 
     realize that.              

05:15.649 --> 05:19.051

yes.                            

05:21.255 --> 05:22.621
That's my favorite part         
 of your voice, so...

Shelby:                         
I've always had a hard time     
believing that i am good enough.

05:38.072 --> 05:42.307
    So to have rihanna and adam,
    like, be so supportive,     

05:42.343 --> 05:44.009
         It's really reassuring.

    James: Before "the voice,"  
         i was an e.M.T.,       

05:58.492 --> 06:01.026
        And i gave that up      
   to be a full-time musician.  

06:01.061 --> 06:03.762
             Someone sent me    
         you singing on youtube,

06:03.797 --> 06:05.764
            And i was like,     
        "this guy is fantastic."

06:05.799 --> 06:07.266
    I was taking a huge risk,   

06:07.301 --> 06:11.236
  Because i have four boys that 
 are depending on me to provide.

06:11.272 --> 06:13.205

06:13.240 --> 06:16.041

  Adam: I do believe            
 that you are better            

06:18.112 --> 06:19.678
Than the best country singers   
on this show right now.         

06:19.713 --> 06:20.879
      And you're a natural.     

06:20.915 --> 06:22.881
       Country music is my life.

06:22.917 --> 06:24.783
     It appears to be your life,
              too, man.         

06:24.818 --> 06:28.253
Fitting in is boring for anyone 
that wants to be extraordinary. 

06:28.289 --> 06:29.955
     I'm gonna go with adam.    
         Oh!                    

06:29.990 --> 06:31.590
         I'd like to stay       
          on team adam,         

06:31.625 --> 06:34.760
     Because it will give me    
    some room to do something   

06:34.795 --> 06:36.495
       That i'm not totally     
       comfortable with...      

06:36.530 --> 06:38.497
      It's an all-out, drag-out,
         rock 'n' roll song.    

06:38.532 --> 06:40.098
         And i need to see more.

06:40.134 --> 06:42.734
  ...And that's exciting to me.

      For my knockout song,     

06:51.011 --> 06:53.145
      I picked "sure be cool    
  if you did" by blake shelton. 

06:53.180 --> 06:55.380
    Knowing that he's gonna be  
  sitting right in front of me, 

06:55.416 --> 06:56.782
  It's a little nerve-wracking, 

06:56.817 --> 07:00.719
   But i'm super excited about  
   showcasing my country side.  

07:00.754 --> 07:04.556
     ¶ but it'd sure be cool    
           if you did ¶         

07:04.592 --> 07:05.958

07:05.993 --> 07:09.328
 Rihanna: He can hit these deep,
     low notes that vibrate,    

07:09.363 --> 07:12.598
  And country is really, really 
  a-a great genre for his voice.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.099
       That was                 
ridiculously amazing.           

07:14.134 --> 07:16.301
That was, like, flawless.       

07:16.337 --> 07:18.704
Musically, it doesn't need      
  to change at all.             

07:18.739 --> 07:21.707
But the physical attitude --    
loosen up and just go.          

07:21.742 --> 07:23.775
                    Cool.       
     You're not an old man.     

07:23.811 --> 07:24.843
     I want you to feel sexy.   

07:24.878 --> 07:26.178
        I want you to feel      
          your swagger,         

07:26.213 --> 07:29.081
        Because right now,      
  i'm missing that, like, spark.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.149
And don't be scared to give them
      some love over here,      

07:31.185 --> 07:33.352
        And in the middle.      
       Don't -- don't hide.     

07:33.387 --> 07:35.854
Find someone out there          
and sing to them a little bit,  

07:35.889 --> 07:38.657
   Because that --              
that translates the most.       
             Mm-hmm.            

07:38.692 --> 07:40.225
                    Yeah.       
 It's game time now.

       my mind and my body      

07:41.962 --> 07:43.295
   Have trouble communicating.  

07:43.330 --> 07:44.463
    But that's just something   

07:44.498 --> 07:46.098
     That i'm just gonna have   
      to get used to doing.

       throw back your... ¶

    is really, really smooth.

          the knockouts,        

07:53.841 --> 07:54.706

07:55.909 --> 07:57.676

       when he's up there.      

07:57.711 --> 07:59.911
       So good.                 
Better than blake shelton.

    that i'm confident onstage  

08:06.320 --> 08:07.786
  And that i believe in myself, 

08:07.821 --> 08:10.989
   There's a great possibility  
   that he could send me home.  

08:11.025 --> 08:12.724
              James:            
     I do feel some pressure.   

08:12.760 --> 08:15.193

          this knockout.

     Nice job, both of you.

                You're right.   

11:50.611 --> 11:52.644

         and it wasn't my group.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.485
                 Well,          
        let me start with james,

12:00.521 --> 12:04.456
     Because he has such awesome
       taste in song selection. 

12:04.491 --> 12:06.024
True. That's the one thing      
i didn't love about it          

12:06.059 --> 12:08.093
Is that, you know...            
          [ laughter ]          

12:08.128 --> 12:09.995
               That's a pretty  
               laid-back song,  

12:10.030 --> 12:12.764
             Honestly,          
    for -- for a knockout round,

12:12.799 --> 12:15.033
           And you make it seem 
         a lot easier than it is

12:15.068 --> 12:16.201
              For me to sing it.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.502
       Listening to you sing it,
               it's like,       

12:17.538 --> 12:19.638
     "man, that dude just sails 
    right through it, you know?"

12:19.673 --> 12:21.439
         Your pitch was perfect.

12:21.475 --> 12:24.009
        And, shelby, i think    
   i would have liked you better

12:24.044 --> 12:25.744
   Had you done one of my songs,
            too, but...         

12:25.779 --> 12:26.745
           [ laughter ]         

12:26.780 --> 12:28.780
             ...But i understand
                 it's weird.    

12:28.815 --> 12:31.283
       No, you definitely picked
         a tough one, you know, 

12:31.318 --> 12:33.418
        And that's the one thing
            i'll say, james,    

12:33.453 --> 12:35.320
               Is shelby swung  
                for the fence   

12:35.355 --> 12:36.888
            With that particular
                song choice.    

12:36.924 --> 12:39.057
          Your big notes,       
    the "jesus, take the wheel,"

12:39.092 --> 12:40.992
               All that stuff,  
                 was so good.   

12:41.028 --> 12:43.895
 But your verses and -- and your
   softer parts of your voice,  

12:43.931 --> 12:45.564
            You were singing    
        just a little bit sharp.

12:45.599 --> 12:47.799
          But overall, i thought
          that was pretty even. 

12:47.834 --> 12:49.000
            I'm not helping you,
                   buddy.       

12:49.036 --> 12:50.735
   You wanted country artists --
           figure it out.       

12:50.771 --> 12:52.370
     [ cheers and applause ]    

12:52.406 --> 12:54.205
              Gwen?             

12:54.241 --> 12:55.840
       Blake, i didn't hear     
        the tuning thing.       

12:55.876 --> 12:57.576
       I felt like you had      
         so much control.       

12:57.611 --> 13:00.445
      And then when you took    
      that chorus up there,     

13:00.480 --> 13:02.213
    I just kept going, "17?!"   

13:02.249 --> 13:04.282
          It was, like,         
       mind-blowing to me.      
                 Thank you.     

13:04.318 --> 13:07.485
     James, i don't understand  
     how you could possibly have

13:07.521 --> 13:10.522
    That many kids sitting there
    so well-behaved.            

13:10.557 --> 13:11.856
       Like, mine don't do that.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.391
                 [ laughter ]   

13:13.427 --> 13:16.995
 To me, you're like this perfect
 kind of country artist.        

13:17.030 --> 13:18.964
          You seem, like,       
          so in control onstage.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.966
      That's really a gift.     
     [ cheers and applause ]    

13:21.001 --> 13:23.268
  Especially in front of blake. 
                [ chuckles ]    

13:23.303 --> 13:24.603
                Pharrell.       

13:24.638 --> 13:27.238
     James, i felt like you sang
        that song flawlessly.   

13:27.274 --> 13:29.174
                 Your vibrato   
               was just crazy,  

13:29.209 --> 13:31.409
            How you just hold it
               effortlessly.    

13:31.445 --> 13:33.878
          I'm like, "gosh, man. 
          Does the guy breathe?"

13:33.914 --> 13:36.948
               Shelby,          
     when it came to the chorus,

13:36.984 --> 13:41.353
    You were swinging your sword
    and just chopping heads off.

13:41.388 --> 13:45.590
      You can't ignore the fight
         that you had in you.   

13:45.626 --> 13:47.592
         The knockouts this year
            are really crazy.   

13:47.628 --> 13:48.426
           Don't you guys think?

13:48.462 --> 13:50.128
       Thank you, coaches.      

13:50.163 --> 13:52.430
     Some nice thoughts,        
     but obviously, adam, it    
     all comes down to you.     

13:52.466 --> 13:54.499
  I heard a nervous             
   17-year-old girl             

13:54.534 --> 13:55.967
   In the beginning             
     of the song,               

13:56.003 --> 13:58.103
 But i think you did            
  a tremendous job.             

13:58.138 --> 14:00.538
And all of us were floored.     
And i had goose bumps.          

14:00.574 --> 14:02.207
So couldn't have crushed it     
      any more.                 

14:02.242 --> 14:03.675
            Thank you.          

14:03.710 --> 14:07.712
        James,                  
because you're so damn good,    

14:07.748 --> 14:10.782
It's hard sometimes for you     
to convey the emotion           

14:10.817 --> 14:12.083
That i know you have.           

14:12.119 --> 14:14.085
Like blake said, you know,      
he's sitting and watching you --

14:14.121 --> 14:16.087
Someone sing his song           
    with more ease              

14:16.123 --> 14:17.622
Than even he can imagine himself
     singing it.                

14:17.658 --> 14:18.857
      The truth                 
  of the matter is,             

14:18.892 --> 14:21.693
I think that shelby had this    
dramatic flair to her song      

14:21.728 --> 14:23.228
That might have helped her.     

14:23.263 --> 14:24.763
  This is obviously             
a really tough decision,        

14:24.798 --> 14:26.097
But i got to make a choice.     

14:26.133 --> 14:27.399
      Adam, who's the winner    
        of this knockout?       

14:27.434 --> 14:30.201
     [ dramatic music plays ]   

14:30.237 --> 14:31.903
      The winner                
 of this knockout...            

14:35.876 --> 14:37.575
    ...Is shelby.               

14:37.611 --> 14:41.479
     [ cheers and applause ]    
     shelby is gonna move on    
      to the live playoffs      

14:41.515 --> 14:43.782
     And represent team adam.   

14:43.817 --> 14:47.285
        I am in complete,       
       like, awe right now.     

14:49.289 --> 14:50.588
            Thank you.          

14:50.624 --> 14:53.291
        I'm so thankful         
that adam chose to keep me here,

14:53.326 --> 14:54.993
      And that i'm moving on    
        to live playoffs.       

14:55.028 --> 14:56.461
          I can't wait.         
          I can't wait.         

14:56.496 --> 14:58.697
            James, anything     
        you want to say to adam?

14:58.732 --> 15:00.298
   It's just been a huge honor, 

15:00.333 --> 15:02.967
  And -- and, you know, my life 
     will never be the same.    

15:03.003 --> 15:04.602
    Right on, man.              

15:04.638 --> 15:06.037

      James did a great job.    

15:09.309 --> 15:11.576
You know, it takes a lot of guts
     to sing a coach's song     

15:11.611 --> 15:12.777
        In front of them.       

15:12.813 --> 15:13.945
              Good luck to you, 
                  brother.      
     Thank you.

     i already used my steal.

     James is literally perfect,

15:18.785 --> 15:21.152

     vulnerability.             

15:21.188 --> 15:23.755
 I was amazed at what she       
 was doing in her high register.

     For shelby,                
     the sky's the limit.

 She amazes me, too.            

15:33.066 --> 15:36.000
     ...Because she has just    
       blossomed, you know?     

15:36.036 --> 15:37.669
  Well, she's gonna             
 keep doing it, too.            

15:37.704 --> 15:38.870
         So,                    
give me a hug, darling.

       to the live playoffs

  My team is all over the place.

15:48.048 --> 15:49.047
         Keith is badass.       

15:49.082 --> 15:50.615
       I love when someone      
          gets out there        

15:50.650 --> 15:52.183
      And unabashedly sings     
       rock 'n' roll songs.     

15:52.219 --> 15:53.518
   Shelby's my country artist,  

15:53.553 --> 15:55.286
  And i think she could actually
      win this whole thing.     

15:55.322 --> 15:57.822
   Jordan smith is otherworldly 
         in his abilities       

15:57.858 --> 15:59.324
         To touch people        
         with his voice.

you've heard of rihanna?

 Welcome back to the final night
 of the knockouts.

    All right, let's bring out  
    two artists now,            

16:52.779 --> 16:55.313
    Going head-to-head,         
    from team pharrell!         

16:55.348 --> 16:59.450

16:59.486 --> 17:00.885
        What?!                  

17:00.921 --> 17:02.620
           Oh, my god.          
         I love this guy.       

17:02.656 --> 17:03.755

           [ laughs ]           

17:11.665 --> 17:13.932
        Let's take a look       
    at how these two match up.  

17:13.967 --> 17:16.835
     Pharrell: I paired mark    
       and siahna together.     

17:16.869 --> 17:20.003
  They both naturally gravitate 
      toward classic songs.     

17:20.040 --> 17:23.540
       So it's really about     
 who could let the old soul out.

17:24.778 --> 17:26.010
                  [ laughs ]    

17:26.046 --> 17:27.779

       When i saw rihanna,      

17:27.814 --> 17:30.114
   I had to get myself together 
        and walk back in,       

17:30.150 --> 17:33.618
     Because she's literally    
  one of our biggest superstars.

17:33.653 --> 17:34.752
     [ laughing ]               
     oh, my lord.               

17:34.788 --> 17:35.787
    Hey, rihanna.               

17:35.822 --> 17:36.988
         [ both chuckle ]       

17:37.023 --> 17:38.656
                How you doing?  

17:38.692 --> 17:39.924
        Good to see you.        
                    I'm sorry.  

17:39.960 --> 17:41.659

  and trying to be an r&b singer

      Working with pharrell     
          is incredible.

  I learned a lot about myself  
and what i can do as a vocalist.

              today?            

18:25.739 --> 18:27.538
                "stand by me,"  
               by ben e. King.  

18:27.574 --> 18:28.907
         Love this song,        
           by the way.          

18:28.942 --> 18:31.910
   It's definitely one of my    
favorite classic r&b soul songs.

18:31.945 --> 18:34.445
     I love the message of it,  
   but i'm not gonna lie to you,

18:34.481 --> 18:36.781
          I'm very, very nervous
             about this one.    

18:36.816 --> 18:40.285
              Mark:             
   I'm very used to theatrics,  
 but this song is way different.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.120
          It's smaller,         
      and to scale it down,     

18:42.155 --> 18:44.222
      The non-dramatic mark     
        kind of scares me.

        Mark!                   

18:52.232 --> 18:55.300
I felt like your approach       
contemporized the song.         

18:55.335 --> 18:58.369
There's no r&b artists          
 that have songs out

 Where they're doing            
that kind of stuff effortlessly.

                     Wow.       

19:05.345 --> 19:08.046
  In the beginning, i would say 
     dial it back physically,   

19:08.081 --> 19:10.348
      And save the dramatics    
            for later,          

19:10.383 --> 19:12.784
  So people at home can be like,
              "ooh!"            

19:12.819 --> 19:13.952
       Build up                 
 to the showmanship.            

19:13.987 --> 19:15.553
You don't have to come in,      
 chopping heads off.

19:17.891 --> 19:20.758
        And "stand by me"       
     is a great song for him.

       into the dramatics.

               doubting it now, 

19:41.414 --> 19:42.847
Then you're gonna make me       
      doubt it.                 

19:42.882 --> 19:44.349

 I'm not -- i'm not doubting it.

    of this doubt?

26:09.402 --> 26:11.936
       There was one moment     
       where you jumped up      

26:11.971 --> 26:13.738

     and then you came down.

     in your voice

     would be able to sing like.

      right now,

You definitely don't expect that
   to be happening.             

27:09.996 --> 27:12.630
I just think that siahna is kind
of a one-off in the world.

          it's like a deadly -- 

27:26.546 --> 27:28.846
That is not a compliment,       
        man.

         a classic song,        

27:40.293 --> 27:43.093
   It requires for you to have  
   personality and showmanship, 

27:43.129 --> 27:46.030
 And that, i think, both of them
       did very well today.

30:10.543 --> 30:12.576
     I love you.                
     I love you.                

30:12.612 --> 30:14.778
          I don't know          
       what i'm gonna do.       
                   Really?      

30:16.148 --> 30:18.482
         Here's a look at       
 how these two artists match up.

30:18.517 --> 30:20.718
      Gwen: I paired jeffery    
        and kota together       

30:20.753 --> 30:22.853
         Because they're        
      my rock/soul singers,     

30:22.888 --> 30:25.255
   And i really only have room  
             for one.           

30:25.291 --> 30:28.025
         This is gonna be       
  a really challenging decision.

30:28.060 --> 30:30.027
     Yay!                       
                 Oh, my god.    

30:30.062 --> 30:31.595
    ¶ da-da-da-da,              
   rihanna's here ¶             

30:31.631 --> 30:34.064
       Hello. How are you?      
     Bad girl riri in the flesh!

30:34.100 --> 30:38.702
Jeffery: Working with rihanna is
   dream-come-true material.    

30:38.738 --> 30:41.405
     She's had hit after hit.   

30:41.440 --> 30:44.108
  To sing for someone like that 
          is incredible.        

30:44.143 --> 30:47.978
Before the blinds, i was working
 at a p.R. Agency in new york.  

30:48.014 --> 30:50.414
     I hadn't been on a stage   
          in six years,         

30:50.449 --> 30:52.549
    And i'm always in the back  
      of my mind, wondering,    

30:52.585 --> 30:53.617
       You know, "what if?"     

30:53.653 --> 30:57.788
   ¶ can i lay by your side? ¶  

30:57.823 --> 31:00.090
  The minute a chair turned, i  
kind of had to give that job up.

31:00.126 --> 31:01.525
                    I won!      

31:01.560 --> 31:03.527
 I feel like an idiot           
that i didn't turn around.      

31:03.562 --> 31:05.496
             You have so much   
         in that voice of yours.

31:05.531 --> 31:06.964
            It's pretty amazing.

31:06.999 --> 31:09.033
        Thank you so much.      

31:09.068 --> 31:12.803
 This competition has completely
    changed how i see myself.   

31:12.838 --> 31:14.605
              I can't believe   
            how far you've come.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.774
       The winner of this battle
              is jeffery.       

31:16.809 --> 31:20.044
        I'm dying to stay       
        working with gwen.      

31:20.079 --> 31:22.579
      ¶ i can't keep up... ¶    

31:22.615 --> 31:25.883
    For the knockouts, i chose  
    "turning tables" by adele.  

31:25.918 --> 31:29.687
  I carry a lot of pain, having 
    lost my past relationship.  

31:29.722 --> 31:32.156
     When this album came out,  
   i was, like, drowning myself.

31:32.191 --> 31:33.323
           Oh, my god.          
      Couldn't listen to it.    

31:33.359 --> 31:34.658
           I was like,          
   "adele, you're gonna make me 

31:34.694 --> 31:35.793
        Jump off of a boat      
          or something."        

31:35.828 --> 31:37.061
     [ laughs ]                 
            i can't.            

31:37.096 --> 31:38.996
         'cause she, literally, 
       like, ripped my heart out

31:39.031 --> 31:40.831
     And was like, "this is what
           your heart's saying."
          it's so true.         

31:40.866 --> 31:42.366
             Jeffery:           
   I want to show that emotion  

31:42.401 --> 31:45.736
     And make my performance    
  more meaningful for everyone. 

31:45.771 --> 31:48.072
This is a really hard song      
 that you've chosen.            
                         Yeah.  

31:48.107 --> 31:49.506
Especially in the hook.         

31:49.542 --> 31:50.941
     ¶ i won't ¶                

31:50.976 --> 31:53.010
 Keep it round.                 
                   Round?       

31:53.045 --> 31:54.545
                 ¶ i won't ¶    

31:54.580 --> 31:58.449
     Yeah, literally, that is   
  the sweet spot of your voice. 

31:58.484 --> 32:01.118
   Your voice can do whatever.  
      It's, like, mad open.     

32:01.153 --> 32:03.454
  But don't wear your voice out.

32:03.489 --> 32:06.590
          Jeffery's tone        
    is very much in the family  

32:06.625 --> 32:08.959
       Of a luther vandross     
          and sam smith.        

32:08.994 --> 32:12.229
   ¶ next time i'll be braver ¶ 

32:12.264 --> 32:14.231
  Rihanna: It's really beautiful
            and fluid.          

32:14.266 --> 32:20.070
If he rounds his vowels, he will
make people melt with his voice.

32:20.106 --> 32:23.073
I think the main thing          
is still body language.         

32:23.109 --> 32:25.442
 ¶ i won't let you ¶            

32:25.478 --> 32:26.944
  You're vulnerable.            
  You're backing up.            

32:26.979 --> 32:28.145
     You're like,               
  "i won't let you."            

32:28.180 --> 32:30.214
Start to get more confident,    
then you're gonna walk.         

32:30.249 --> 32:32.149
        'cause you're gonna say,
             "no, you guys.     

32:32.184 --> 32:34.017
I'm actually starting           
     to get mad."               

32:34.053 --> 32:35.452
And then you're gonna walk      
    towards them,               

32:35.488 --> 32:37.955
And you're gonna let them know  
that you're changing your mood. 

32:37.990 --> 32:39.590
    Sadness turns into anger,   

32:39.625 --> 32:42.259
   And that's the journey that  
  you need to take us through.  
                   Yeah.        

32:42.294 --> 32:44.428
             ¶ i won't let you ¶

32:44.463 --> 32:46.764
  If jeffery can just really get
  deep inside himself           

32:46.799 --> 32:49.266
       And be honest and reveal,
       really, who he is,       

32:49.301 --> 32:50.300
    The body language will come.

32:52.538 --> 32:56.406
       Before the blinds,       
i worked at the live-music venue

32:56.442 --> 32:58.408
     That my family and i own   
             and run.           

32:58.444 --> 32:59.476
         Check mike two.        

32:59.512 --> 33:01.512
    I was practicing, writing,  

33:01.547 --> 33:03.714
       Recording every day      
          with my band.         

33:03.749 --> 33:05.149
    And it's been a struggle.   

33:05.184 --> 33:06.884
           ¶ oh, whoa ¶         

33:06.919 --> 33:08.585
        ¶ bring it to me ¶      

33:08.621 --> 33:10.521
      In my blind audition,     
          chairs turned,        

33:10.556 --> 33:13.423
 And i was like, "yes, finally!"

33:13.459 --> 33:14.625
    ¶ bring it on home to me ¶  

33:14.660 --> 33:17.161
          Kota, you're like     
      a modern-day cyndi lauper.

33:17.196 --> 33:19.463
       I could see you in a band
                with me.        

33:19.498 --> 33:22.566
       I have idolized you      
    since i was 5 years old.    
                 [ laughs ]     

33:22.601 --> 33:24.501
          I pick gwen.          
   Adam: Yes!                   

33:24.537 --> 33:28.005
      With gwen as my coach,    
  i feel like i've grown a lot. 

33:28.040 --> 33:31.642
       I want to be gwen's      
     first "voice" champion.    

33:31.677 --> 33:36.747
   For my knockout performance, 
  i chose "barracuda" by heart. 

33:36.782 --> 33:42.219
  It is the ultimate embodiment 
   of female rock and strength. 

33:42.254 --> 33:45.756
  I feel like this song fits me 
           really well          

33:45.791 --> 33:47.891
  Because of my rock background.

33:47.927 --> 33:51.662
I think that, for me,           
vocally, some of those growls,  

33:51.697 --> 33:53.130
     I don't know               
if they're so effective.        

33:53.165 --> 33:55.098
You don't want to lose          
   your femininity.             

33:55.134 --> 33:57.835
If you can find places in       
the performance to bring it down

33:57.870 --> 34:00.671
Without compromising the tone,  
       find it.                 

34:00.706 --> 34:02.840
  I could never sing this song. 

34:02.875 --> 34:04.074
      Most people couldn't.     

34:04.109 --> 34:06.476
          Kota can belt,        
       and she can do runs.     

34:06.512 --> 34:09.346
That blows me away, that someone
 can have so much versatility.  

34:09.380 --> 34:12.149
 Sometimes she goes a little bit
           too extreme.         

34:12.184 --> 34:13.984
       When you start to go     
       in those big notes,      

34:14.018 --> 34:16.820
   There were a couple of them  
  that felt really, ahh, loud...

34:16.856 --> 34:18.455
                    Yeah.       
        ...And it wasn't,       
        like, controlled.       

34:18.489 --> 34:21.891
    You weren't making them big.
    You were kind of going...   

34:21.927 --> 34:25.228
   Kota is a little firecracker.

34:25.264 --> 34:28.866
      She's one of the most     
      comfortable people onstage

34:28.900 --> 34:30.467
        Here at "the voice."    

34:30.502 --> 34:32.936
        ¶ no, you better        
        make up something... ¶  

34:32.972 --> 34:35.405
   But she needs to stay        
   a little bit more in control.

34:35.440 --> 34:37.574
        Her sass is there,      
        performance-wise.       

34:37.610 --> 34:39.509
      I feel like she'll be fine
      in that regard            

34:39.545 --> 34:41.879
     As long as she stays on top
     of her vocals.             

34:41.914 --> 34:44.882
        ¶ oh, barracuda ¶       

34:44.917 --> 34:47.751
   How fun is this?             
   It's inspiring.              

34:47.786 --> 34:51.355
      With "turning tables,"    
  please welcome jeffery austin.

34:51.389 --> 34:52.956

             His voice is crazy.

36:40.165 --> 36:41.631

36:44.870 --> 36:46.236
For a spot in the live playoffs.

          ¶ barracuda ¶         

36:49.408 --> 36:52.109
     That was unbelievable.     
It blew the roof off this place.

  Your personality comes through
           so clearly.          

36:54.279 --> 36:55.545
       This is really hard.

   Daly: And later, blake tries 
    to get closer to rihanna.   

36:58.917 --> 37:01.885
I think you should reconsider   
my nickname for you, "anna."    

37:01.920 --> 37:03.653
              "anna" is weird.  
  You like "riri"?              

37:08.860 --> 37:10.193
     ¶ this is "the voice" ¶    

37:10.229 --> 37:12.195

 A big hand for jeffery and kota
   here in the knockout round.  

38:43.755 --> 38:45.155
            Team gwen.          

38:45.190 --> 38:48.091
     Nice job, both of you.     
                    Thank you.  

38:48.127 --> 38:49.493
     Let's get some comments    
        from the coaches.       

38:49.528 --> 38:50.794
      We'll start with adam.    

38:50.829 --> 38:53.964
Jeffery, the originality i hear 
in the tone of your voice       

38:53.999 --> 38:58.435
Is one of the more identifiable,
   different tones              

38:58.470 --> 38:59.903
We -- we've really ever heard   
    on this show.               

38:59.938 --> 39:01.404
     [ cheers and applause ]    

39:01.440 --> 39:02.739
    You're the guy              
  to watch out for.             

39:02.774 --> 39:04.074
     Where gwen,                
being the only person           

39:04.109 --> 39:05.242
  That turned around            
       for you,                 

39:05.277 --> 39:06.843
Is gonna have quite a story     
  to tell, i think,             

39:06.879 --> 39:09.212
  About what i think            
  your potential is.            

39:09.248 --> 39:10.747
        Thank you so much.      

39:10.782 --> 39:11.882
And, kota, i love seeing        

39:11.917 --> 39:13.884
When people just swing          
so hard for the fences.         

39:13.919 --> 39:16.786
You chose the hardest vocal     
      maybe ever                

39:16.822 --> 39:17.888
    In the history              
   of hard vocals.              

39:17.923 --> 39:18.989
   I respect that.              
              Yeah.             

39:19.024 --> 39:20.724
       I think it took a minute,
       but by the end,          

39:20.759 --> 39:22.526
  You were really full-throttle,
  and it was great.             

39:22.561 --> 39:24.261
          If it was me          
          in -- in gwen's shoes,

39:24.296 --> 39:26.730
     I would say because of how 
     different you are, jeffery,

39:26.765 --> 39:27.931
        I-i'd be going with you.

39:27.966 --> 39:28.832
              Thank you.        
              Thank you.        

39:28.867 --> 39:30.033
         Thank you, adam.       
          Blake shelton.        

39:30.068 --> 39:33.136
              Jeffery,          
    it's always impressive to me

39:33.172 --> 39:36.406
          When somebody takes   
        an opportunity like this

39:36.441 --> 39:38.508
               And they really  
                strip it down   

39:38.544 --> 39:41.044
   And show what they're made of
           as a vocalist.       

39:41.079 --> 39:43.146
        Sometimes it sucks,     
   and sometimes it's brilliant,

39:43.182 --> 39:44.514
         Like what you just did.

39:44.550 --> 39:47.250
     I thought that was so good.
   Thank you, blake, so much.   

39:47.286 --> 39:49.786
   And, kota, you know,         
   you took a big risk, too.    

39:49.821 --> 39:52.355
   The only thing that          
   i think it -- that it lacked 

39:52.391 --> 39:54.291
   Was showing                  
   some dynamics.               

39:54.326 --> 39:56.193
   That song is, like,          
   on 10 the whole time,        

39:56.228 --> 39:57.561
   Which is probably            
   what you do.                 

39:57.596 --> 39:59.496
   That's what gwen is gonna    
   struggle with here,          

39:59.531 --> 40:00.730
   Because going into           
   the lives,                   

40:00.766 --> 40:03.934
   I know she's bound to want   
   a rocker chick like you.     

40:03.969 --> 40:06.069
   So i don't know what         
   you're gonna do, buddy.      

40:06.104 --> 40:07.170
            Pharrell.           

40:07.206 --> 40:09.105
       Pharrell: Jeffery, today,
              you came out      

40:09.141 --> 40:12.175
     And really showed people   
  who you are, what you're into,

40:12.211 --> 40:14.678
               And how you like 
               to be perceived. 

40:14.713 --> 40:16.246
              I just think that 
             in a couple places,

40:16.281 --> 40:17.914
          You may have been able
            to push it harder.  

40:17.950 --> 40:19.416
           Okay. Yeah.          

40:19.451 --> 40:21.685
 But your performance was great,
  because it was about identity.

40:21.720 --> 40:24.487
               And, kota,       
        i'm applauding you, too,

40:24.523 --> 40:26.690
               For taking such  
                 a huge risk.   

40:26.725 --> 40:28.858
          I feel like there was 
          a couple flat moments,

40:28.894 --> 40:31.661
But where you didn't necessarily
       have the control,        

40:31.697 --> 40:33.964
                 You made up    
               in personality.  
           Thank you.           

40:33.999 --> 40:36.266
    Well, coach, the            
    decision is in your         
    hands. What do you think?   

40:36.301 --> 40:37.500
              Gwen:             
       This is really hard.     

40:37.536 --> 40:40.470
       Kota, i was shocked      
    when you chose this song.   

40:40.505 --> 40:42.639
        But you're trying       
      to kind of tell people    

40:42.674 --> 40:44.207
        The kind of record      
      you would make, right?    

40:44.243 --> 40:47.677
      So your personal style    
       and your personality     

40:47.713 --> 40:48.878
     Come through so clearly.   

40:48.914 --> 40:51.114
      Great job with that.      
                 Thank you.     

40:51.149 --> 40:53.783
      Jeffery, i'm so blown away

40:53.819 --> 40:55.518
  With what these guys just said
  about you,                    

40:55.554 --> 40:57.220
              Because everything
              you said          

40:57.256 --> 40:59.122
          Is everything         
          we've been working on.

40:59.157 --> 41:00.457
        The problem that you had

41:00.492 --> 41:02.225
      Was you weren't showing us
      who you were.             

41:02.261 --> 41:03.593
          You weren't letting us
          into your heart.      

41:03.629 --> 41:04.995
         And you did that today.

41:05.030 --> 41:08.198
I mean, that is, like,          
such a huge, big, gigantic deal.

41:08.233 --> 41:10.967
   When you hear this guy sing, 
   the tone he has in his voice,

41:11.003 --> 41:12.102
                It's very magic.

41:12.137 --> 41:14.070

   It means a lot.

           to be on team gwen.

 me as a performer.             

41:43.568 --> 41:46.503
     Incredible.

         to see kota go.

    a really, really good job.

      was bringing something

        perform and emote

     Is, like, completely thanks
        to you and pushing me,

              for that.

my nickname for you, "anna."    

42:55.607 --> 42:57.540
              "anna" is weird.  
You like "riri"?                

42:57.576 --> 42:58.942
           I mean, it's not new.

42:58.977 --> 43:00.043
A lot of people say that?       

43:00.078 --> 43:02.112
              You thought       
       that you're so brilliant,

43:02.147 --> 43:03.546
                  And nobody    
              could think of it?

43:03.582 --> 43:05.715
I invented that nickname        
years ago, because i'm a fan.   

43:05.751 --> 43:07.150
                   For me?      
      Yes.                      

43:07.185 --> 43:09.285
                Congratulations.
     Thank you.                 
Thank you very much.            

43:09.321 --> 43:11.554
                     Nailed it. 
   You know what?               
I'm switching it to "anna"      

43:11.590 --> 43:12.922
Because you're being            
 so cocky about it.

43:12.958 --> 43:14.557
 While they get that sorted out,

43:14.593 --> 43:17.360
      Let's look at blake's     
      next knockout pairing.    

43:17.396 --> 43:18.628
              Blake:            
    I paired emily and nadjah   

43:18.663 --> 43:21.464
   Because they're both sweet,  
        soft-spoken girls,      

43:21.500 --> 43:24.200
  And they've got these unique, 
         delicate voices,       

43:24.236 --> 43:26.636
       But i only have room     
   for one of them on my team.  

43:26.671 --> 43:28.571
              Emily:            
   Being a high-school student, 

43:28.607 --> 43:30.540
         I never imagined       
 that i would be on "the voice,"

43:30.575 --> 43:31.908
 And that this would be my life.

43:33.011 --> 43:35.779
        During the blinds,      
    adam fought really hard...  

43:35.814 --> 43:37.614
   I'm telling you,             
i want you more than he does.   

43:37.649 --> 43:39.015
            I'm sorry.          
          I pick blake.         

43:39.050 --> 43:40.183
        Ahh!                    
                        Yes!    

43:40.218 --> 43:42.419
          ...But blake gets me  
          and what i want to do.

43:42.454 --> 43:44.521
    Your approach               
can have more energy.           

43:44.556 --> 43:46.890
       I just want you to change
             the attitude.      

43:46.925 --> 43:49.692
     Blake has helped me find   
   a different side of myself.  

43:49.728 --> 43:53.029
     ¶ but if you're looking    
       for a real romance ¶     

43:53.064 --> 43:55.999
   It is absolutely incredible  
  to have made it to knockouts. 

43:56.034 --> 43:57.066
               Daly: Emily ann! 

43:57.102 --> 43:58.268
        This was the goal.      

43:58.303 --> 44:01.070
       Anything after this      
    is gonna be unimaginable.   

44:01.106 --> 44:02.672

44:02.707 --> 44:03.807
   This is rihanna.             

44:03.842 --> 44:05.275
          You are whoa.

  gonna be singing?             

44:09.181 --> 44:10.313
     "cowboy, take me away."    

44:10.348 --> 44:11.881
      Oh, yeah.                 
    Dixie chicks.               
        I love that song.

You <i> do</i> know this song?          

44:13.084 --> 44:14.884
       I do know this song,     
      and i love this song.     

44:14.920 --> 44:17.153
     It gives me the chills.    
       I want to hear you.

44:20.091 --> 44:21.458
 ¶ i want to skip and not fall ¶

44:21.493 --> 44:22.859
    I love this song so much,   

44:22.894 --> 44:25.595
  Because i've been listening   
to it since i was a little girl.

44:25.630 --> 44:27.831
     ¶ except for maybe you ¶   

44:27.866 --> 44:30.133
      I came into this as a     
  country-and-bluegrass artist, 

44:30.168 --> 44:31.835
  But i haven't really been able
           to show off          

44:31.870 --> 44:32.902
      My bluegrass side yet.    

44:32.938 --> 44:34.871
         ¶ take me away ¶       

44:34.906 --> 44:37.507
      This song will really     
          showcase that.        

44:37.542 --> 44:40.844
The bigger notes that you hit   
were a little bit flat.         

44:40.879 --> 44:44.547
                 Okay. Yeah.    
 And one of them was            
¶ except for maybe you ¶        

44:44.583 --> 44:46.049
The way                         
natalie sings that is           

44:46.084 --> 44:48.351
She hits those syllables        
really quick.                   

44:48.386 --> 44:49.853
              She punches them. 
   ¶ may-be you ¶               

44:49.888 --> 44:51.988
And you were kind of holding out
the notes a little bit longer.  

44:52.023 --> 44:53.790
         I love the sound       
          of your voice.        

44:53.825 --> 44:56.993
     But it was almost like     
you were afraid to hit the note.

44:57.028 --> 44:58.795
                   Mm-hmm.      
         Don't be afraid        
          to go there.          

44:58.830 --> 45:00.230
          That's what we want   
          to hear.              

45:00.265 --> 45:02.432
 Emily: It was really           
 frustrating, standing up there,

45:02.467 --> 45:05.869
 Trying to hit those notes,     
 and knowing that i usually can,

45:05.904 --> 45:07.804
      But today,                
      i'm not on top of my game.

45:07.839 --> 45:09.772
           Go for it.           
                    Okay.       

45:09.808 --> 45:12.909
    Emily ann, you can tell that
    she's really, really young  

45:12.944 --> 45:17.580
    In her voice, but she can do
    such amazing things with it.

45:17.616 --> 45:21.084
        ¶ cowboy, take me away ¶

45:21.119 --> 45:22.986
           She kind of fell back
           a little bit,        

45:23.021 --> 45:25.688
              But i think       
              she can be a star.

45:25.724 --> 45:28.224
                  ¶ oh, i pray ¶

45:28.260 --> 45:29.893
            ¶ closer to heaven ¶

          Blake: Emily ann's got
          a very delicate voice,

45:31.763 --> 45:34.297
         And so                 
         i-i think she's cut out

45:34.332 --> 45:36.065
          A pretty big challenge
          for herself.          

45:36.101 --> 45:38.001
             Thank you so much. 
       Knock it out, girl.      

45:38.036 --> 45:39.269
                  Thank you.    

45:39.304 --> 45:41.604

   of making this thing happen. 

45:41.640 --> 45:43.006

      her back.                 

45:45.477 --> 45:46.609
              I'll work on it.

you've heard of rihanna?        

45:53.685 --> 45:56.886
        Have i heard of her?!   
     I grew up listening to her.

45:56.922 --> 45:58.187
        When i walked into      
      my knockout rehearsal     

45:58.223 --> 46:01.658
    And i saw rihanna standing  
      there, it was a dream.

  gonna be singing?

               by alicia keys.  

46:09.634 --> 46:11.067
     This is an amazing song.   

46:11.102 --> 46:13.303
     Did you choose this song   
    for any particular reason?  

46:13.338 --> 46:15.004
              I'm big on, like, 
              women empowerment.

46:15.040 --> 46:17.407

         so i want to make sure

      she's gonna learn from it.

    her guard a little bit,

  That not only could be played 
          on the radio,         

55:31.062 --> 55:33.496
  I think she's gonna be played 
    on the radio really soon.   

55:33.531 --> 55:35.498
          How incredible is she?
       I know.                  

55:35.533 --> 55:37.233
          You're gonna be around
           for a while, kiddo.  

55:37.268 --> 55:39.835
      You're gonna make me rich.
          [ laughter ]          

55:39.871 --> 55:42.004
              Daly:             
     As the night went on...    

55:42.039 --> 55:44.540
    ¶ if you're looking to be   
    somebody's just friends ¶   

55:44.575 --> 55:46.008
              Daly:             
   ...Blake completed his team  

55:46.043 --> 55:48.577
     By picking zach seabaugh   
        over chris crump.       

55:48.613 --> 55:49.879
       ¶ that's just fine ¶     

55:49.914 --> 55:54.350
       ¶ if you're gonna be     
     somebody's heartbreak ¶    

55:54.385 --> 55:59.722
         ¶ be mi-i-i-ne ¶       

55:59.757 --> 56:02.191
                  Being 16      
           with a song like that

56:02.226 --> 56:05.094
       Is like trying to connect
            with the lyrics     

56:05.129 --> 56:08.464
    And being sure that girls   
  in here feel what he's saying.

56:08.499 --> 56:10.499
                 And damned     
           if he didn't do that.

56:10.535 --> 56:13.102
  It's just like you controlled 
           the moment.          

56:13.137 --> 56:14.570
  Let's do it, man.             
     Let's do it.               

56:14.605 --> 56:15.938
   Great job, man.              

56:15.973 --> 56:18.507
Daly: Here's blake's locked live
         playoff team.          

56:18.543 --> 56:20.743
    Blake: Even though my team  
        is country-heavy,       

56:20.778 --> 56:22.344
     It's still very diverse,   

56:22.380 --> 56:25.614
   Because i have young people  
 who like vintage country music.

56:25.650 --> 56:28.617
      I've got a young guy      
who loves current country music.

56:28.653 --> 56:31.287
        I've got barrett,       
  who can pretty much do it all.

56:31.322 --> 56:33.355
       And i've got ivonne.     
    She's not country at all.   

56:33.391 --> 56:34.890
      She really stands out     
       like a sore thumb --     

56:34.926 --> 56:36.325
     That's good for ivonne.    

56:36.360 --> 56:38.093
        The other coaches       
     better be watching out,    

56:38.129 --> 56:40.162
         Because my team,       
      we're gonna bring it.     

56:40.198 --> 56:42.364
       Daly: Coming up...       
        Rihanna: I want,        
  the moment you start singing, 

56:42.400 --> 56:44.800
  People to be like,            
  "who's <i> that</i> kid?"             

56:44.835 --> 56:48.237
  Daly:

56:51.042 --> 56:51.907
           You're sick.         

56:51.943 --> 56:54.310
All the crazy stuff that you do,

56:54.345 --> 56:55.945
     Even when you feel like    
      you're being awkward,     

56:55.980 --> 56:57.112
       That's the best part     
             of you.            

56:57.148 --> 56:58.781
       Daly: And later...       
     [ cheers and applause ]

     ...A shocking ending       
     to the knockouts.

      We've got that steal!     

57:04.188 --> 57:05.788
      Oh, my god.               

57:05.823 --> 57:07.489
      What's up, boy scouts?    

57:07.525 --> 57:10.359
  It's christina grimmie, coming
    to you from the knockouts,  

57:10.394 --> 57:13.195
    Where artists are rocking   
 showstopping heels and jewelry.

57:13.231 --> 57:16.498
     From emily ann roberts'    
  cowboy boots and studded belt,

57:16.534 --> 57:19.501
        To mark hood's hat      
      and fashion sneakers,     

57:19.537 --> 57:21.904
       And morgan frazier's     
     bold statement necklace,   

57:21.939 --> 57:25.574
During the knockouts, it's been 
all about shoes and accessories,

57:25.610 --> 57:28.143
      Which is why i will be    
          taking these.

57:42.727 --> 57:44.860
         Let's bring out        
    this next knockout pairing  

57:44.895 --> 57:46.528
       From team pharrell!

      Hey, bud.                 

57:52.570 --> 57:53.936
                How are you?    
  Good to see you.              

57:53.971 --> 57:55.704
       Before we get to it,     

57:55.740 --> 57:57.940
        Let's take a look       
    at how these two match up.  

57:57.975 --> 58:01.977
            Pharrell:           
  I paired evan and tim together
     because i wanted to have   

58:02.013 --> 58:04.913
       The two alternative      
      indie artists compete,    

58:04.949 --> 58:07.416
        And i want to see       
   who really sits comfortably  

58:07.451 --> 58:09.251
  In that alternative position. 

58:09.287 --> 58:12.488
      [ chuckles ] hi, evan.    
           How are you?         

58:12.523 --> 58:14.256
                   What's up?   
            I'm good.           

58:14.292 --> 58:16.191
            I was shocked,      
            seeing rihanna.     

58:16.227 --> 58:19.228
I'm already getting to work with
pharrell week in and week out,  

58:19.263 --> 58:23.899
 But now i've got an opportunity
 to work with rihanna.          

58:23.934 --> 58:25.100
    And they're both such, like,
    pioneers of their musicir c.

58:25.136 --> 58:26.669
           You guys want to sing
           some songs?          

58:26.704 --> 58:28.871
      Before "the voice,"       
      i was able to use my music

58:28.906 --> 58:30.806
         To actually help people
         at a dementia center.  

58:30.841 --> 58:31.707
           Thank you.           
          [ applause ]          

58:31.742 --> 58:33.709
        It was so great to speak
        to people               

58:33.744 --> 58:35.744
    That needed to hear         
    encouragement through music.

58:35.780 --> 58:38.514
Halfway through my blind        
audition, i didn't have a chair.

58:38.549 --> 58:40.049
         [ cheers and applause ]

58:40.084 --> 58:41.183
      And then it was just like,
      "boom, boom, boom,"       

58:41.218 --> 58:42.651
          Right at the end.     

58:42.687 --> 58:44.753
         What's your favorite   
     stevie wonder song to sing?

58:44.789 --> 58:46.121
      "overjoyed," for sure.    

58:46.157 --> 58:48.757
        And would you do a verse
               of the chorus?   
           You got it.          

58:48.793 --> 58:51.460
          ¶ maybe, too,         
          if you would believe ¶

58:51.495 --> 58:53.162
           Pharrell really got  
           my attention,        

58:53.197 --> 58:54.530
    'cause he wanted to know    
           about me...          
              Wow.              

58:54.565 --> 58:56.498
 ...Which showed me             
 that he wanted to invest in me.

58:56.534 --> 58:57.966
              I pick pharrell.  

58:58.002 --> 59:00.869
       The winner of this battle
       is evan.                 

59:00.905 --> 59:03.272
         Evan: My job now       
         is to prove to pharrell

59:03.307 --> 59:05.641
           Why he should take me
           to lives.            

59:05.676 --> 59:07.176
Talk to me about your song.     

59:07.211 --> 59:09.044
      "dare you to move" is one 
      of my favorite songs ever.

59:09.080 --> 59:11.580
        I love that song.       
       I've seen switchfoot live
        like four or five times.

59:11.615 --> 59:14.650
              Ooh.              
                So i'm all about
    wanting to encourage people.

59:14.685 --> 59:16.218
    This song just says,        
    "do it."                    

59:16.253 --> 59:18.354
 Like, we have a short amount of
 time on earth, so go kill it.  

59:18.389 --> 59:20.089
     You're gonna be playing    
           the guitar?          

59:20.124 --> 59:21.690
   Yes. And that's another thing
         i'm excited about.     

59:21.726 --> 59:23.025
        I haven't gotten to play
           an instrument yet.   

59:23.060 --> 59:28.764
       ¶ where can you run      
    to escape from yourself? ¶  

59:28.799 --> 59:30.966
  This is a very flattering song
          for his voice         

59:31.001 --> 59:32.134
     And for his personality.   

59:32.169 --> 59:34.103
      ¶ i dare you to move ¶    

59:34.138 --> 59:36.638
   And i felt like it does show 
     the inspirational artist   

59:36.674 --> 59:38.907
         He wants people        
          to see him as.        

59:38.943 --> 59:40.342
      Your voice is amazing.    

59:40.378 --> 59:41.377
        Yeah.                   
                 Thank you.     

59:41.412 --> 59:44.813
           Like, incredible grit
           and texture.         

59:44.849 --> 59:46.148
                  Thank you.    

59:46.183 --> 59:49.218
 When you moved the guitar away,
       i believed you more.     

59:49.253 --> 59:52.621
    It's such an intense song   
     and an intense message.    

59:52.656 --> 59:56.024
      This almost was hiding    
          a lot of that.        

59:56.060 --> 59:58.861
             So, just drop this?
          I want, like,         
  the moment you start singing, 

59:58.896 --> 01:00:01.563
  People to be like,            
  "who's <i> that</i> kid?"             

01:00:01.599 --> 01:00:04.400
 This is coming from            
 the queen of vibe.             
                 All right.     

01:00:04.435 --> 01:00:07.636
 I was excited for the chance to
 play an instrument this round. 

01:00:07.671 --> 01:00:10.038
        ¶ today never happened ¶

01:00:10.074 --> 01:00:12.174
           But it's a lot easier
           to convey emotion    

01:00:12.209 --> 01:00:14.109
   When you're not hiding behind
   your instrument.             

01:00:14.145 --> 01:00:17.112
                 ¶ befo-o-o-re ¶

01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:21.483
              Whoa.             
       1,000 times better.      
        Yeah.                   

01:00:21.519 --> 01:00:22.785
             1,000 times better?
          You're sick.          

01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:24.086
        I'm really excited      
            about you.          

01:00:24.121 --> 01:00:25.888
You said you wanted people      
   to feel emotion.             

01:00:25.923 --> 01:00:27.055
               I want this song 
             to really hit home.

01:00:27.091 --> 01:00:29.258
       If you stay cool,        
the passion will come out of you

01:00:29.293 --> 01:00:30.225
       Because it's there.      

01:00:30.261 --> 01:00:31.994
      Don't think about it.     
        Yeah.                   

01:00:32.029 --> 01:00:33.429
          Just feel it.         
                  Feel it.      

01:00:33.464 --> 01:00:34.496
               You'll know      
               what feels right.

01:00:34.532 --> 01:00:36.231
 Don't over-think --            
      over-feel.                

01:00:36.267 --> 01:00:38.700
       Rihanna: Your voice      
      is definitely gonna be    

01:00:38.736 --> 01:00:40.736
     The most important thing   
       in this competition.     

01:00:40.771 --> 01:00:43.338
           But movement         
        is also important.      

01:00:43.374 --> 01:00:44.840
     You need to believe it,    

01:00:44.875 --> 01:00:48.277
   Because that's the only way  
     <i> we</i> are gonna believe it.  

01:00:48.312 --> 01:00:52.214
        Before the blinds,      
         i was struggling       

01:00:52.249 --> 01:00:55.384
     As a full-time musician    
     and as a music producer.   

01:00:55.419 --> 01:00:58.887
  I came to "the voice" because 
    i wanted to have a mentor   

01:00:58.923 --> 01:01:00.689
  To help me grow as an artist. 

01:01:00.724 --> 01:01:03.058
   ¶ give a little time to me ¶ 

01:01:03.093 --> 01:01:04.259
      At the blind audition,    

01:01:04.295 --> 01:01:07.496
       I was just so happy      
       to be on team gwen.      

01:01:07.531 --> 01:01:09.932
      I just love how passionate
               you are          

01:01:09.967 --> 01:01:12.501
          And how you want      
   to really deliver your heart.

01:01:12.536 --> 01:01:14.436
    ¶ just us, you find out ¶   

01:01:14.472 --> 01:01:16.271
    ¶ nothing that i wouldn't   
     want to tell you about ¶   

01:01:16.307 --> 01:01:19.141
          ¶ no, no, no ¶        

01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:21.944
        The winner of the battle
               is ellie.        

01:01:21.979 --> 01:01:24.513
       To lose the battle,      
    i was kind of heartbroken.  

01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:27.015
     Daly: There is a steal!    

01:01:27.051 --> 01:01:28.484
      Tim: At the same time,    

01:01:28.519 --> 01:01:31.386
 I was just, like, really stoked
   to be working with pharrell. 

01:01:31.422 --> 01:01:33.522
  The song came on,             
and you just were like...       

01:01:33.557 --> 01:01:34.389
                  [ laughs ]    

01:01:34.425 --> 01:01:35.591
 I was like, "okay."            

01:01:35.626 --> 01:01:37.626
Bravery. That should be         
the only crutch you lean on.    

01:01:37.661 --> 01:01:39.995
  And i think today             
was a good exhibition for that. 

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:42.898
  ¶ and that's what's going on ¶

01:01:42.933 --> 01:01:45.267
   ¶ nothing's fine, i'm torn ¶ 

01:01:45.302 --> 01:01:48.637
         Tim chose "torn"       
      by natalie imbruglia.     

01:01:48.672 --> 01:01:50.472
      ¶ this is how i feel ¶    

01:01:50.508 --> 01:01:53.408
I thought it was a good song for
 him because it challenges him. 

01:01:53.444 --> 01:01:55.010
         He wanted to go        
   outside of his comfort zone. 

01:01:55.045 --> 01:01:57.446
       He has a good voice,     
   and he knows how to use it.  

01:01:57.481 --> 01:01:58.981
             ¶ torn ¶           

01:01:59.016 --> 01:02:00.949
        Interesting voice.      

01:02:00.985 --> 01:02:02.684
       Right?                   
            Thanks so much, man.

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:04.086
         You're so cool onstage,
         though.                

01:02:04.121 --> 01:02:05.320
Yeah, you got a vibe.           

01:02:05.356 --> 01:02:07.523
    Like, all the crazy stuff   
         that you do...         
                    Yeah.       

01:02:07.558 --> 01:02:09.758
    ...Even when you feel like  
     you're being awkward...    
                   Uh-huh?      

01:02:09.793 --> 01:02:11.593
     ...That's the best part    
             of you.            
                    Okay.       

01:02:11.629 --> 01:02:14.429
     'cause that's just your    
   personality coming through.  

01:02:14.465 --> 01:02:15.731
         It's not a bad awkward?

01:02:15.766 --> 01:02:17.966
I guarantee you somebody thought
     mick jagger was weird      

01:02:18.002 --> 01:02:19.601
   When he started performing.  
                    Yeah.       

01:02:19.637 --> 01:02:21.737
            But mick jagger     
            is dynamite onstage,

01:02:21.772 --> 01:02:23.705
    Because he is not afraid    
        to do anything...       
                          Okay. 

01:02:23.741 --> 01:02:25.274
             ...And that is what
             i want you to do   

01:02:25.309 --> 01:02:27.209
            From the beginning  
            of this performance.

01:02:27.244 --> 01:02:28.710
                  Pharrell:     
             The other thing is,

01:02:28.746 --> 01:02:32.014
 You're constricting the pathway
            where your voice is.
             Okay.              

01:02:32.049 --> 01:02:33.715
You're squeezing the life       
out of your performance.        

01:02:33.751 --> 01:02:35.817
                    Okay.       
 'cause you'll go...

 ¶ this is how i feel ¶         

01:02:44.995 --> 01:02:47.596
Own the stage. Engage           
like you did in that            
last performance.               

01:02:47.631 --> 01:02:49.331
         [ laughs ] yeah.       

01:02:49.366 --> 01:02:50.799
           I loved him.         

01:02:50.834 --> 01:02:53.302
         His voice can do       
   all these different things.  

01:02:53.337 --> 01:02:55.304
     ¶ i'm all out of faith ¶

     ¶ this is how i feel ¶

     not be afraid              

01:03:00.945 --> 01:03:02.444
     Of the artist that he is.  

01:03:02.479 --> 01:03:05.647
         I want him to be, like,
            the comeback boy.   

01:03:05.683 --> 01:03:06.848
 Yeah. That's right.

01:07:04.922 --> 01:07:07.055
      But i think as it got     
          further along,        

01:07:07.090 --> 01:07:08.290
      Some of the ad-libbing    

01:07:08.325 --> 01:07:10.292
   Just needed to be worked out 
        a little bit more.      

01:07:10.327 --> 01:07:13.895
 But i think your voice has such
    an interesting tone to it.  

01:07:13.931 --> 01:07:15.530
         It's so unique.        

01:07:15.566 --> 01:07:16.798
         That's just you.       

01:07:16.834 --> 01:07:18.800
      Nobody else has that,     
    and i love that about you.

    Pharrell: Evan, you came out
     and you gave it your all.  

01:08:25.769 --> 01:08:28.904

      to you was, you know,

       without the guitar.

  you do have a different voice.

     very special.

 I love every song from her from
   the first time she came out. 

01:12:15.866 --> 01:12:18.032
  I'm so excited.               
     Thank you. I'm so grateful.
              I'm so grateful.  

01:12:18.068 --> 01:12:19.767
I can't wait for her to hear    
 how amazing you are.           

01:12:19.803 --> 01:12:21.402
          I need to hear        
           this voice.          

01:12:21.438 --> 01:12:23.605
        For the knockouts,      
         i'll be singing        

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:27.041
   "midnight train to georgia"  
  by gladys knight and the pips.

01:12:27.077 --> 01:12:31.279
    ¶ he said he's going back   
            to find ¶           

01:12:31.314 --> 01:12:34.015
      Yes!                      
          ¶ huh, ooh ¶          

01:12:34.050 --> 01:12:37.452
 I chose this song              
 because i love the soulfulness,

01:12:37.487 --> 01:12:40.488
       And gladys knight        
       opened the -- the pathway

01:12:40.524 --> 01:12:41.856
        For artists like myself.

01:12:41.892 --> 01:12:43.191
          Rihanna:              
          You did a couple runs,

01:12:43.226 --> 01:12:45.426
     And you kind of stopped    
     for breath in between them.

01:12:45.462 --> 01:12:47.128
          Smooth it out         
          just a little bit.    

01:12:47.164 --> 01:12:48.163
                 Okay. Great.   

01:12:48.198 --> 01:12:50.398
 Can you do it again,           
another version of it?          

01:12:50.433 --> 01:12:51.766
         Just freestyle.        

01:12:51.801 --> 01:12:53.568
         I'm so intrigued       
          by your voice         

01:12:53.603 --> 01:12:56.237
       That i want to see       
     all the aspects of it.     
                    Okay.       

01:12:56.273 --> 01:12:57.739
         Gwen: One thing        
         that regina needs to do

01:12:57.774 --> 01:12:59.641
               Is take liberties
               and be creative. 

01:12:59.676 --> 01:13:01.042
     ¶ i've got to be with him ¶

01:13:01.077 --> 01:13:02.744
     Whoo!                      
         ¶ i got to go ¶        

01:13:02.779 --> 01:13:03.878
    Yes!                        
             ¶ oh ¶             

01:13:03.914 --> 01:13:06.814
        ¶ on that midnight train
        to georgia ¶            

01:13:06.850 --> 01:13:08.216
  Whoo! Yes!                    
     Rihanna: I love regina.    

01:13:08.251 --> 01:13:11.085
     She opens her mouth,       
     and you're just floored.   

01:13:11.121 --> 01:13:13.121
     I would never want         
     to battle her.             

01:13:13.156 --> 01:13:16.357
     ¶ in my, hey, hey ¶        

01:13:16.393 --> 01:13:18.326
  I want to stay on gwen's team,

01:13:18.361 --> 01:13:22.397
  Because that pop that she has,
  she's gonna pull it out of me.

01:13:22.432 --> 01:13:24.666
Between the two versions,       
almost mash it together...      

01:13:24.701 --> 01:13:27.135
              Yeah.             
...Because i wouldn't go        
too far from the melody,        

01:13:27.170 --> 01:13:29.037
'cause then people              
are gonna get scared.           

01:13:29.072 --> 01:13:31.706
                    Okay.       
          You have such         
       an incredible gift.      

01:13:31.741 --> 01:13:33.741
        It doesn't run out      
   at a certain age, you know?  

01:13:33.777 --> 01:13:35.476
                    Whew,       
              thank you so much.

01:13:35.512 --> 01:13:36.811
      And that's why i love     
            this show,          

01:13:36.846 --> 01:13:38.379
         Because it's all       
        about your voice.       

01:13:39.382 --> 01:13:42.483
    Riley: Before the blinds,   
  i was doing shows around town,

01:13:42.519 --> 01:13:44.152
        And i was posting       
         youtube videos.        

01:13:45.222 --> 01:13:46.921
   During the blind auditions,  

01:13:46.957 --> 01:13:49.123
         Pharrell turned,       
       and i was ecstatic.      

01:13:49.159 --> 01:13:53.695
      This girl's r&b tone      
         is everything.         
                   Is ill.      

01:13:53.730 --> 01:13:55.863
             ¶ why your people ¶

01:13:55.899 --> 01:13:58.566
In the battle, i definitely felt
like i left it all on the stage.

01:13:59.669 --> 01:14:02.270
       But evan won that battle.

01:14:02.305 --> 01:14:04.405
                   Whoa!        

01:14:04.441 --> 01:14:06.808
  Riley: I definitely want to   
  prove to gwen that i'm worthy.

01:14:06.843 --> 01:14:09.377
  It's a little bit intimidating
  because i'm new to the team.  

01:14:09.412 --> 01:14:12.347
 But i'm very excited           
 to show her what else i can do.

01:14:12.382 --> 01:14:14.449
       ¶ your heart is glowing ¶

01:14:14.484 --> 01:14:15.750
    For my knockout performance,

01:14:15.785 --> 01:14:17.852
       I'm gonna be singing "xo"
       by beyoncé.              

01:14:17.887 --> 01:14:21.189
   ¶ in the darkest night hour ¶

01:14:21.224 --> 01:14:23.925
          Singing a beyoncé song
          is very risky,        

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:25.960
           Because she's such   
           an incredible talent,

01:14:25.996 --> 01:14:28.496
      And she's so high up there
      in respect.               

01:14:28.531 --> 01:14:30.265
        So i definitely wanted  
        to put my own spin on it

01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:33.101
So that it didn't come off      
like i was trying to be beyoncé.

01:14:33.136 --> 01:14:35.136
              ¶ oh, you can turn
              my lights out ¶   

01:14:35.171 --> 01:14:37.105
     ¶ your love is like xo ¶   

01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:38.172
        Whoo!                   

01:14:38.208 --> 01:14:40.541
            Rihanna:            
I was really impressed by riley.

01:14:40.577 --> 01:14:43.177
    She did all types of stuff  
          to this song.         

01:14:43.213 --> 01:14:45.246
  But if you took all that away,

01:14:45.282 --> 01:14:47.949
      She still had a voice     
   that could stand on its own. 

01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:49.484
      ¶ love me lights out ¶    

01:14:49.519 --> 01:14:53.655
        ¶ oh, you can turn      
         my lights out ¶        

01:14:53.690 --> 01:14:55.089
           Why -- why am <i> i</i> here?

01:14:55.125 --> 01:14:56.958
       I know.                  
  I mean, honestly.             
                [ chuckles ]    

01:14:56.993 --> 01:14:58.593
I-i'm in shock right now,       

01:14:58.628 --> 01:15:00.261
Because i didn't know           

01:15:00.297 --> 01:15:03.564
      That i got such an awesome
       person on my team! Ahh!  

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:05.833
               Wow!             
   Like, i got an amazing girl. 

01:15:05.869 --> 01:15:08.569
       She's 19 years old.      
         She's beautiful.       

01:15:08.605 --> 01:15:10.705
      Her voice is gorgeous.    

01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:12.206
                   Rihanna:     
              What a steal, too.

01:15:12.242 --> 01:15:15.143
       I am just so excited     
       that i stole riley.      

01:15:15.178 --> 01:15:18.379
     At what age                
did you start doing this?       

01:15:18.415 --> 01:15:20.548
             Probably seriously 
                 around 15.     
       Mm-hmm.                  

01:15:20.583 --> 01:15:22.083
               Started posting  
               youtube videos.  

01:15:22.118 --> 01:15:24.519
              One of your songs 
              was my first video

01:15:24.554 --> 01:15:26.354
     To go over a million views.
            Get out!            

01:15:26.389 --> 01:15:28.022
       What?                    
Over a million views.           
                    Yeah.       

01:15:28.058 --> 01:15:30.458
           Which song?          
          Um, it was "diamonds."

01:15:30.493 --> 01:15:32.093
              Wow.              
                And i -- yeah.  

01:15:32.128 --> 01:15:34.829
       You definitely have      
            the voice           

01:15:34.864 --> 01:15:37.231
 To do exactly the type of music
        you want to do...       

01:15:37.267 --> 01:15:39.467
                 Thank you.     
           ...Pop/r&b.          

01:15:39.502 --> 01:15:42.670
       You know the right amount
       of attitude to give.     

01:15:42.706 --> 01:15:46.841
Don't ever overdo it, because   
this right here is, like, great.

01:15:46.876 --> 01:15:47.875
                    Yeah.       

01:15:47.911 --> 01:15:49.777
        I feel so excited       
       about my two steals.     

01:15:49.813 --> 01:15:53.815
      Both regina and riley     
         are so talented.       

01:15:53.850 --> 01:15:55.383
  My team went to another level.

01:15:55.418 --> 01:15:57.285
               Miss polka dot,  

01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:59.620
     You got some hard decisions
         to make, girlfriend.   

01:15:59.656 --> 01:16:01.055
       I know.                  

01:16:01.091 --> 01:16:03.891
  Regina: I know i'm gonna have 
      to bring my "a" game.     

01:16:03.927 --> 01:16:06.861
    I'm gonna have to put in,   
             deliver,           

01:16:06.896 --> 01:16:10.531
     Nail every single second   
          of this song,         

01:16:10.567 --> 01:16:13.034
       Especially being new     
           to the team.         

01:16:13.069 --> 01:16:16.571
  Riley: This whole time, i have
   been scraping at the bottom. 

01:16:16.606 --> 01:16:18.339
      I got one chair turned    
            at blinds.          

01:16:18.375 --> 01:16:20.675
    I didn't win my battle --   
          i got stolen.         

01:16:20.710 --> 01:16:24.579
 If i want to win this knockout,
   i need to just wow everyone  

01:16:24.614 --> 01:16:28.149
     And prove that i deserve   
        to still be here.       

01:16:28.184 --> 01:16:30.551
     [ cheers and applause ]    

01:16:30.587 --> 01:16:34.555
       And now, with "xo,"      
     here is riley biederer.    

01:16:39.129 --> 01:16:43.564

     [ cheers and applause ]    

01:20:29.025 --> 01:20:30.925
          Stepping it up        
        in the knockouts.       

01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:32.293
    Whoo-hoo-hoo!               

01:20:34.631 --> 01:20:35.596
        Whoo!                   

01:20:35.632 --> 01:20:37.064
What are you gonna do?          

01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:38.766
                I don't know.   
    What an awesome knockout.   

01:20:38.801 --> 01:20:39.934
   Let's start with you, adam.  

01:20:39.969 --> 01:20:42.103
 Regina, i miss you.            

01:20:42.138 --> 01:20:44.238
  But now i miss you            
      even more.                

01:20:44.273 --> 01:20:46.307
As far as i'm concerned,        
once you're on my team,         
you're always on my team.       

01:20:46.342 --> 01:20:47.808
              She's on <i> my</i> team. 
   I know she is.               

01:20:47.844 --> 01:20:49.343
           [ laughter ]         

01:20:49.379 --> 01:20:51.345
      But, man,                 
you just crushed this.          

01:20:51.381 --> 01:20:53.881
And then riley comes out,       
    kills it, too.              

01:20:53.916 --> 01:20:55.850
I think that this was           
      your best                 

01:20:55.885 --> 01:20:57.318
       Because                  
 you were not afraid.           

01:20:57.353 --> 01:21:00.121
And there's a lot to be afraid  
    of over here.               
            [ laughing ] i know.

01:21:00.156 --> 01:21:03.791
     You guys both impressed me 
     <i> tremendously,</i> so good job.

01:21:03.826 --> 01:21:05.393
                 Thank you.     
             Blake.             

01:21:05.428 --> 01:21:07.628
                 Regina,        
          that was unbelievable.

01:21:07.664 --> 01:21:09.096
                Blew the roof   
               off this place.  

01:21:09.132 --> 01:21:12.667
        And then, riley, i saw  
     a little bit more diversity

01:21:12.702 --> 01:21:15.069
           In -- in what she did
               as a vocalist,   

01:21:15.104 --> 01:21:17.304
            But how do you argue
           with what regina did,

01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:20.207
        Which was, you know,    
   she parted my hair, you know?

01:21:20.243 --> 01:21:22.810
       So i think it's literally
       a matter of who you think

01:21:22.845 --> 01:21:23.844
                 You can take   
                the farthest.   

01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:25.112
            Pharrell?           

01:21:25.148 --> 01:21:27.882
      Miss regina, i mean,      
you had people up on their feet.

01:21:27.917 --> 01:21:30.985
     But you also had, like,    
 the goose bumps and the chills.

01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:34.655
   That was one of the craziest 
   performances i've ever seen  

01:21:34.691 --> 01:21:37.525
     In terms of just filling   
           that church.         

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:38.926
 You know how i know            
you killed it, regina?          

01:21:38.961 --> 01:21:41.095
    'cause i know               
when pharrell looks confused,   

01:21:41.130 --> 01:21:42.697
That's when i know something    
    is real good,               

01:21:42.732 --> 01:21:43.998
Because he'll be like...        

01:21:44.033 --> 01:21:45.866
           [ laughter ]         

01:21:45.902 --> 01:21:48.836
    Honestly, it was so much,   
    and it was never too much.  

01:21:48.871 --> 01:21:49.770
       Perfect.                 

01:21:49.806 --> 01:21:51.906
              Riley,            
       you were on my team.     

01:21:51.941 --> 01:21:53.607
             You know           
      how i feel about you.     

01:21:53.643 --> 01:21:55.910
      I thought that you did    
          really great.         

01:21:55.945 --> 01:21:58.179
     And i do think that gwen   
       has a tough decision     

01:21:58.214 --> 01:21:59.947
         Because there's        
          no reason why         

01:21:59.982 --> 01:22:01.849
      Either one of you guys    
         should go home.        

01:22:01.884 --> 01:22:03.751
    Daly: Thank you, pharrell.  
    Gwen, what did you think?   

01:22:03.786 --> 01:22:05.953
    When i got you on my team,  
  i was like, "oh, she's great,"

01:22:05.988 --> 01:22:08.689
   And then during rehearsals,  
       i was like, "what?!      

01:22:08.725 --> 01:22:11.092
           Oh, my gosh.         
    This girl is incredible!"   

01:22:11.127 --> 01:22:12.626
     Rihanna was blown away.    

01:22:12.662 --> 01:22:14.495
     Your voice is so unique,   

01:22:14.530 --> 01:22:17.231
    And it kind of doesn't fit  
        inside your body.       

01:22:17.266 --> 01:22:19.700
        I just think that       
 you have so, so much potential.

01:22:19.736 --> 01:22:21.635
             Regina,            
       you're unbelievable.     

01:22:21.671 --> 01:22:23.938
      What i love about you     
         is your spirit.        

01:22:23.973 --> 01:22:28.209
        I was so taken in       
      by your determination.    

01:22:28.244 --> 01:22:29.977
     I was brought to tears.    

01:22:30.012 --> 01:22:32.079
            Right now,          
         i'm so confused,       

01:22:32.115 --> 01:22:35.516
      Because you should be     
           on the show.         

01:22:36.586 --> 01:22:38.185
        But so should <i> you.</i>      

01:22:38.221 --> 01:22:41.088
     Gwen, a tough decision,    
      but the time has come.    

01:22:41.124 --> 01:22:42.490
         Who's the winner       
        of this knockout?       

01:22:42.525 --> 01:22:44.692
           Okay, um...          

01:22:44.727 --> 01:22:46.260
         What a position        
          to be put in.         

01:22:46.295 --> 01:22:48.863
             I mean,            
       this is ridiculous.      

01:22:50.133 --> 01:22:52.700
         I'm -- you know        
  the winner of this knockout...

01:22:54.904 --> 01:22:56.237
      ...Is gonna be regina.    

01:22:56.272 --> 01:22:58.973
     Regina, congratulations.   

01:22:59.008 --> 01:23:00.775
         You're moving on       
      to the live playoffs.     

01:23:00.810 --> 01:23:02.343
                Yes, yes, yes,  
                  yes, yes!     

01:23:02.378 --> 01:23:04.879
    Riley could win the whole   
  competition. She's that good. 

01:23:04.914 --> 01:23:07.381
  But in this moment, there's no
  way that i was gonna sit there

01:23:07.416 --> 01:23:09.183
            And ignore          
    what regina had just done.

    There's so much potential   
             in you,

And back on team pharrell.      

01:24:01.938 --> 01:24:04.104
         I was impressed        
     by riley's performance.    

01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:06.774
   And i love that she has room 
             to grow.           

01:24:06.809 --> 01:24:08.242
              Everything happens
                for a reason.   

01:24:08.277 --> 01:24:12.646
          You're something else.

 Thank you so much.             

01:24:14.784 --> 01:24:16.050
        She -- she has it.      

01:24:16.085 --> 01:24:17.885
That worked out good.           

01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:19.253
        Yo, it worked out great.

01:24:19.288 --> 01:24:22.756
    My team is super soulful.   

01:24:22.792 --> 01:24:24.124
          It's special.         
         It's different.        

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:27.127
         They all vibrate       
    at a very high frequency,   

01:24:27.163 --> 01:24:29.129
     And everyone in the room   
            feels it.           

01:24:29.165 --> 01:24:31.532
   I hope america sees in them  
       what i see in them.      

01:24:32.869 --> 01:24:34.301
               Yay!             

01:24:34.337 --> 01:24:36.871
     My team, going into the    
     playoffs, is so amazing.   

01:24:36.906 --> 01:24:40.541
         We're eccentric        
     and all over the place.    

01:24:40.576 --> 01:24:42.276
           I can't wait         
     to work with them more.    

01:24:42.311 --> 01:24:45.079
     My team is strong enough   
     to make it all the way.
