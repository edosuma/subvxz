WEBVTT

00:02.669 --> 00:04.887
No. No, stay with me on this.

00:05.255 --> 00:06.889
Her birthday is today,

00:07.132 --> 00:08.651
but the surprise party
isn't until Thursday.

00:08.675 --> 00:09.818
Thursday? Why Thursday?

00:09.843 --> 00:10.903
Parents' idea.

00:10.927 --> 00:11.904
No way she'll expect it.

00:11.928 --> 00:15.199
But the point is I gotta
give her something today,

00:15.223 --> 00:16.534
and I gotta give her
something Thursday,

00:16.558 --> 00:17.660
and I'm kind of broke.

00:17.684 --> 00:19.996
And the pressure's really on,
because the best present

00:20.020 --> 00:21.904
should come from your
boyfriend, right?

00:22.063 --> 00:23.948
So you got her a sweater?

00:24.607 --> 00:26.284
Hey, it's cashmere.

00:26.401 --> 00:28.087
Tasteful, elegant,
figure-flattering.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.672
Cashmere? You said you
didn't have any money.

00:29.696 --> 00:30.756
Well, it's not real cashmere.

00:30.780 --> 00:33.875
It's like, more like
a faux cashmere.

00:34.492 --> 00:36.210
So, what did you get
her for Thursday?

00:36.411 --> 00:38.296
So far, dinner at Salinger's.

00:38.329 --> 00:39.682
I know. I know.

00:39.706 --> 00:42.935
But I could get her one of
those snow globe thingies.

00:42.959 --> 00:44.979
She collects them. That's
kind of classy, right?

00:45.003 --> 00:47.346
Says "I know you." Cheap.

00:49.674 --> 00:51.517
Happy birthday to me!

00:52.802 --> 00:53.738
Wow!

00:53.762 --> 00:55.197
- This is yours?
- Yeah.

00:55.221 --> 00:57.575
My parents gave it to me as a
birthday, belated Christmas,

00:57.599 --> 01:00.777
"we love you even if you're not our
biological child" present! What do you think?

01:01.061 --> 01:02.580
- Wow.
- This is so cool.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.915
A little guilt goes a long way. Hop
in, you have to hear the stereo!

01:04.938 --> 01:06.491
Okay.

01:07.984 --> 01:10.661
Wow.

01:12.280 --> 01:13.507
For me?

01:13.531 --> 01:14.749
Uh, yeah.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.417
It's from Julia.

01:17.202 --> 01:19.253
Oh. Thanks. Yeah. Buckle up.

01:21.581 --> 01:22.516
All right.

01:22.540 --> 01:23.716
Tomorrow, sonnets.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.352
Get a good night's sleep

01:25.376 --> 01:26.928
and bring me your
favorite adjective.

01:29.839 --> 01:32.610
Hey, I have to watch
Owen tonight,

01:32.634 --> 01:34.936
but you should come over.
We can do some homework.

01:35.261 --> 01:37.105
Is that what we're
calling it now?

01:40.308 --> 01:42.411
Hey, Julia, can you
hang out a bit?

01:42.435 --> 01:43.412
Uh-huh.

01:43.436 --> 01:44.779
Catch you later.

01:45.104 --> 01:46.572
Hey, Mr. Peck.

01:47.315 --> 01:48.292
What's up?

01:48.316 --> 01:51.536
Well, my dear, I wanted
to talk to you about

01:51.861 --> 01:53.496
what you handed in yesterday.

01:54.405 --> 01:55.706
I hate to say it, but

01:56.533 --> 01:58.835
this one's not quite
up to your usual.

01:59.160 --> 02:00.336
It's not?

02:01.454 --> 02:02.807
"Your touch is like a feather.

02:02.831 --> 02:04.433
"Your touch is like an arrow.

02:04.457 --> 02:06.143
"Your touch makes
me feel alive."

02:06.167 --> 02:07.510
And so on and so forth.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.470
Um,

02:11.256 --> 02:12.640
it doesn't feel real.

02:13.508 --> 02:16.403
You know, maybe you should write
about something that you know.

02:16.427 --> 02:17.687
I do

02:18.388 --> 02:19.657
know

02:19.681 --> 02:21.065
about this.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.330
Listen, if you want
to write about a boy,

02:26.354 --> 02:28.156
about a man touching you,

02:30.066 --> 02:31.752
you gotta reach
down in your soul,

02:31.776 --> 02:35.538
make me feel like... Like
I'm inside your body.

02:35.822 --> 02:39.292
What's it like when... When he
puts his hands on your skin?

02:40.160 --> 02:41.679
And when you're kissing,
what's going on?

02:41.703 --> 02:43.430
What's going on in here?

02:43.454 --> 02:44.755
In here?

02:48.543 --> 02:49.886
I want the goods.

02:54.799 --> 02:56.100
Okay.

02:56.843 --> 02:58.445
Oh, hey.

02:58.469 --> 03:00.072
Don't get so bummed out.

03:00.096 --> 03:01.689
It's just an assignment.

03:43.681 --> 03:45.576
Don't tell this story!

03:45.600 --> 03:47.328
She's just getting
into the music.

03:47.352 --> 03:48.829
She's pumping her
fists like this.

03:48.853 --> 03:50.497
You should've seen it, Jason.

03:50.521 --> 03:52.708
And then there's this poor
fool standing next to her!

03:52.732 --> 03:54.200
I loathe you.

03:54.692 --> 03:56.921
Boom! She smashes him
right in the eye.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.538
Gave him a shiner,
I swear to God.

03:59.280 --> 04:00.257
Is that true?

04:00.281 --> 04:02.218
Hey, Charlie, we were just...

04:02.242 --> 04:03.761
You gave somebody a black eye?

04:03.785 --> 04:05.554
Oh, not on purpose.

04:05.578 --> 04:08.349
Um... So we've got
this retirement party

04:08.373 --> 04:09.683
coming in today
for lunch, right?

04:09.707 --> 04:12.228
You wanna do, like,
one big table or...

04:12.252 --> 04:13.386
It can wait.

04:13.836 --> 04:16.106
So, what were you at?
Some concert?

04:16.130 --> 04:18.608
Um, Atlas over on...

04:18.632 --> 04:19.767
Oh, I know Atlas.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.103
Yeah, let me know the next
time you get tickets.

04:22.178 --> 04:24.897
Well, actually, we've got

04:25.431 --> 04:26.617
an extra one for tonight.

04:26.641 --> 04:27.826
Yeah?

04:27.850 --> 04:29.360
Great.

04:29.435 --> 04:30.746
You don't want to go with us.

04:30.770 --> 04:31.664
I don't?

04:31.688 --> 04:34.323
Hanging with the help.
Wouldn't that be slumming?

04:34.357 --> 04:36.210
Anyway, it'll probably
run pretty late,

04:36.234 --> 04:37.503
and you've got that

04:37.527 --> 04:38.671
little boy at home?

04:38.695 --> 04:41.539
Not a problem, unless you
guys don't want me to go.

04:41.572 --> 04:42.675
Oh, no. No, no.

04:42.699 --> 04:46.335
We just didn't know you liked
to do stuff like this.

04:46.452 --> 04:47.846
Like what?

04:47.870 --> 04:49.422
Go out and have fun?

04:50.081 --> 04:51.507
Believe it or not, I do.

04:57.588 --> 04:59.348
You are not gonna eat that.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.142
Come on. Don't be a doof.

05:01.175 --> 05:02.643
Just do what I do, okay?

05:02.844 --> 05:05.614
Come on, fiddle
girl, I dare you.

05:05.638 --> 05:07.148
Jody, what are you doing?

05:07.348 --> 05:10.035
This is so disgusting.

05:10.059 --> 05:11.704
Excuse me. Oh, gross!

05:11.728 --> 05:13.080
Um, excuse me, sir!

05:13.104 --> 05:14.623
There's a dead roach
in my ice cream.

05:14.647 --> 05:15.823
You didn't buy that.

05:15.857 --> 05:18.210
Yeah, well, she, uh... She...

05:18.234 --> 05:19.962
No, duh! My mom did.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.839
She's outside spewing
in the dumpster.

05:21.863 --> 05:24.624
You would be too if you
just ate half a cockroach.

05:24.991 --> 05:27.043
- I don't see anything.
- Of course not.

05:27.368 --> 05:29.263
We thought it was a... A nut

05:29.287 --> 05:31.348
until we poked at
it with a spoon,

05:31.372 --> 05:33.466
and then it got all
squished up in the sauce,

05:33.875 --> 05:35.259
and... And see?

05:36.461 --> 05:37.928
There's his little legs.

05:39.672 --> 05:41.640
Look, I'll get you another one.

05:41.924 --> 05:43.392
Make that two.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.811
And dead bugs are not a topping.

05:59.150 --> 06:00.701
Hey, you.

06:01.569 --> 06:02.629
Hi.

06:02.653 --> 06:03.756
You headed home?

06:03.780 --> 06:04.798
Mm-hm.

06:04.822 --> 06:06.791
Jump in. Elvis and I
will give you a lift.

06:07.617 --> 06:09.585
There, now you know
my innermost secret.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.379
I give silly names to my cars.

06:12.246 --> 06:15.091
That's okay, it's nice out.
I'm gonna...

06:15.124 --> 06:17.561
It's nice out? You look
like you're freezing.

06:17.585 --> 06:18.854
You're practically turning blue.

06:18.878 --> 06:20.689
- I'm okay.
- What is this?

06:20.713 --> 06:23.442
I offer up one criticism all semester.
Now you hate me.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.893
No, of course not. I just, um...

06:26.177 --> 06:27.446
I just wanna walk.

06:27.470 --> 06:30.022
Will you stop playing hard
to get and get in the car?

06:30.056 --> 06:31.450
Come on.

06:31.474 --> 06:33.150
Julia.

06:47.198 --> 06:49.009
They could've changed
my birthday, too,

06:49.033 --> 06:50.751
just like they changed my name.

06:51.202 --> 06:54.171
Oh, well. At least I got a
convertible out of it, right?

06:55.123 --> 06:56.934
You really think
they got you a car

06:56.958 --> 06:58.968
because they feel
guilty or something?

06:59.085 --> 07:01.470
Yeah, of course they did. Why
shouldn't they? They lied to me.

07:02.338 --> 07:04.515
Wow. You're pretty
mad about this.

07:04.799 --> 07:06.235
No, no.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.403
I don't know. I just figured
if they wanna buy me stuff

07:08.427 --> 07:10.155
to make themselves feel
better, who am I to say no?

07:10.179 --> 07:12.440
Oh, look! Earrings.

07:14.600 --> 07:15.953
Hey, those are nice.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.236
The red ones.

07:18.146 --> 07:19.665
Those are garnets.
My birthstone.

07:19.689 --> 07:20.916
Did you know that?

07:20.940 --> 07:22.084
Really?

07:22.108 --> 07:23.669
I just thought they kind
of looked like you.

07:23.693 --> 07:26.871
And they're 300. Yikes.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.967
Come on. There's a
bookstore down the block.

07:29.991 --> 07:30.884
Let's go browse.

07:30.908 --> 07:32.752
You are so adorable!

07:33.077 --> 07:34.555
Hinting around,
trying to figure out

07:34.579 --> 07:36.265
what to get me for my birthday.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.715
Me? No!

07:37.915 --> 07:39.508
No. I got that covered.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.177
All set for, like, weeks.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.220
Sort of.

07:43.379 --> 07:45.014
Well, not really.

07:45.339 --> 07:47.725
Okay, yes. I am hinting.

07:48.134 --> 07:50.978
You're so totally sweet. You
really wanna get these for me?

07:51.429 --> 07:54.616
Well, yeah, I do,
but I can't, so...

07:54.640 --> 07:56.201
Yes, you can.

07:56.225 --> 07:58.861
You can. I'll buy them, and
you can give them to me.

07:59.520 --> 08:00.863
What?

08:01.731 --> 08:03.584
- That's not the same thing.
- Sure, it is.

08:03.608 --> 08:05.210
Look, you thought of
getting them for me.

08:05.234 --> 08:07.703
And it's the thought that counts, right?
So why not?

08:08.112 --> 08:09.423
'Cause they're way
too expensive and...

08:09.447 --> 08:12.166
Bailey, you've got a
girlfriend with a Gold card.

08:15.203 --> 08:17.306
Vodka doesn't stain, does it?

08:17.330 --> 08:18.348
I know it doesn't smell.

08:18.372 --> 08:19.892
Can't take you anywhere, huh?

08:19.916 --> 08:21.226
No.

08:21.250 --> 08:23.260
So this was fun.

08:23.669 --> 08:26.472
Yeah. It's still pretty early.

08:26.881 --> 08:28.849
Yeah, we were maybe gonna
go back to Parker's.

08:29.175 --> 08:32.061
You probably prefer sitting
on actual furniture.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.813
Actual furniture's a plus.

08:34.972 --> 08:36.491
You know what, I got
a whole house full.

08:36.515 --> 08:37.909
Couch, side chairs,

08:37.933 --> 08:40.027
not to mention hot and
cold running food.

08:40.852 --> 08:42.238
I don't know.

08:42.270 --> 08:44.824
We wouldn't want you to go
out of your way or anything.

08:44.982 --> 08:46.659
How's it out of my way?
It's my house.

08:48.903 --> 08:50.830
Come on. It's just 10
minutes from here.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.041
Sure. Why not?

09:04.585 --> 09:06.512
You wanna hear something funny?

09:07.505 --> 09:08.639
You.

09:08.965 --> 09:11.276
You're, like, the last
person in the world

09:11.300 --> 09:13.320
I ever thought I'd
be hanging out with.

09:13.344 --> 09:15.062
The last?

09:16.430 --> 09:17.690
How come?

09:18.057 --> 09:19.910
When I first came
to the restaurant

09:19.934 --> 09:21.537
for the interview,

09:21.561 --> 09:24.363
the agency told me I was
meeting some Mr. Salinger.

09:24.564 --> 09:27.074
I expected you to be 50.

09:27.233 --> 09:31.579
And then I see this guy, you,

09:31.612 --> 09:34.957
and I'm thinking, "No way."

09:35.700 --> 09:37.918
But the thing is,

09:38.869 --> 09:41.046
you acted like you were 50!

09:41.247 --> 09:42.849
Get out of here. I did not.

09:42.873 --> 09:43.850
Yeah, you did.

09:43.874 --> 09:47.678
You had the whole "wife
and kids" thing going on.

09:49.088 --> 09:50.389
Fiancee.

09:51.882 --> 09:54.727
Ex fiancee.

09:56.053 --> 09:57.354
Oh.

09:59.807 --> 10:03.027
Please. I'm trying to
have a good time here.

10:03.269 --> 10:07.615
Anyway, the whole interview
totally freaked me out.

10:09.150 --> 10:11.003
"What are your qualifications?

10:11.027 --> 10:13.797
"We require exemplary
references."

10:13.821 --> 10:15.966
I must've been trying out my new

10:15.990 --> 10:18.635
"Hey, I'm a grown-up"
personality.

10:18.659 --> 10:21.253
So now, is this your old

10:21.537 --> 10:24.391
"I'm just a nice, normal,
fun guy" personality?

10:24.415 --> 10:27.259
Ha-ha. I guess it is.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.552
I like it better.

10:29.003 --> 10:32.765
You know, just in case you're
taking a survey or anything.

10:43.351 --> 10:44.369
Hey!

10:44.393 --> 10:45.912
Ugh.

10:45.936 --> 10:47.321
What time is it?

10:50.149 --> 10:52.368
I knew poli-sci was dull, but...

10:53.361 --> 10:54.838
I wasn't drooling, was I?

10:54.862 --> 10:56.080
No.

10:57.948 --> 10:59.301
Oh, man, it's late.

10:59.325 --> 11:00.751
I should cut.

11:01.118 --> 11:02.670
No.

11:05.831 --> 11:07.508
Don't go yet.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.051
No?

11:17.635 --> 11:20.364
I, um... I don't
wanna do this now.

11:20.388 --> 11:21.740
No, really? Why not?

11:21.764 --> 11:23.273
Huh?

11:25.393 --> 11:26.787
Justin!

11:26.811 --> 11:29.113
When I say no, that's
what it means. No!

11:30.356 --> 11:31.699
What's with you?

11:32.942 --> 11:34.451
Nothing.

11:37.071 --> 11:38.580
Julia? I'm...

11:40.866 --> 11:42.876
No one else, okay? I mean it.

11:43.202 --> 11:44.837
All right.

11:52.253 --> 11:57.516
Today after school, Mr.
Peck gave me a ride.

11:58.384 --> 11:59.601
And...

11:59.885 --> 12:01.478
I got in the car.

12:03.472 --> 12:05.983
And he put his hand on my leg,

12:07.810 --> 12:09.528
and he tried to kiss me.

12:11.689 --> 12:12.707
What?

12:12.731 --> 12:15.409
I mean, I got out of there.
I left.

12:16.277 --> 12:17.661
And...

12:19.155 --> 12:20.706
Nothing happened.

12:24.493 --> 12:26.128
Nothing happened.

12:41.302 --> 12:44.438
What's the name of that Jane
Siberry CD you taped for me?

12:45.181 --> 12:46.398
What are you doing?

12:46.849 --> 12:48.484
I'm labeling tapes.

12:49.643 --> 12:51.163
Why aren't you ready for school?

12:51.187 --> 12:52.446
I'm not going.

12:52.771 --> 12:54.124
You're not going?

12:54.148 --> 12:55.991
Is there an echo in here?

12:58.027 --> 12:58.920
Jule...

12:58.944 --> 13:00.088
Look, I don't wanna
talk about it.

13:00.112 --> 13:01.173
Listen to me.

13:01.197 --> 13:02.924
Hey, hey, listen to me!

13:02.948 --> 13:04.885
Look, you're gonna
get ready right now.

13:04.909 --> 13:06.344
You're gonna come with me.

13:06.368 --> 13:08.138
We're gonna go to Principal
Stickley's office.

13:08.162 --> 13:10.307
And you're gonna tell her
what happened with Mr. Peck.

13:10.331 --> 13:12.392
I am not gonna make
a thing about this.

13:12.416 --> 13:14.343
Well, this is already a thing.

13:14.543 --> 13:16.646
It's already a thing, or you
wouldn't be sitting here

13:16.670 --> 13:18.273
in your pajamas at
8:00 in the morning.

13:18.297 --> 13:20.775
Look, I just don't feel like
seeing him today, that's it.

13:20.799 --> 13:22.569
Oh, and what about tomorrow?

13:22.593 --> 13:24.196
You're gonna be late
for first period.

13:24.220 --> 13:25.947
- Julia...
- Can you tell Sarah

13:25.971 --> 13:28.065
to take good notes for me in Chem.
Would you?

13:40.653 --> 13:42.746
Oh!

13:42.905 --> 13:44.674
Oh, I... Oh!

13:44.698 --> 13:46.468
Shoot. I'm sorry.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.094
I am sorry.

13:48.118 --> 13:49.721
I'm sorry. I...

13:49.745 --> 13:50.722
Klutz.

13:50.746 --> 13:53.423
I know. I'm thinking
about a 12-step program.

13:55.334 --> 13:56.645
Listen, uh,

13:56.669 --> 13:58.178
I had a great time last night.

13:59.338 --> 14:02.140
It's been a while,
you know, so thanks.

14:03.092 --> 14:05.111
Does that mean if I asked you
to do something tonight,

14:05.135 --> 14:06.812
you'd say yes?

14:07.263 --> 14:09.533
Odds are pretty
much in your favor.

14:09.557 --> 14:11.733
I've got this Christmas
tree in my dorm room.

14:11.934 --> 14:14.162
Thing's shedding
like a dog in July.

14:14.186 --> 14:17.281
Any chance of you helping me
drag it to the recycle place?

14:18.482 --> 14:20.784
My truck and I are
at your service.

14:21.735 --> 14:23.004
Great.

14:23.028 --> 14:24.872
Oh, by the way...

14:25.781 --> 14:27.467
don't serve those.

14:27.491 --> 14:29.209
Right.

14:32.246 --> 14:33.598
Is that the bimbo?

14:33.622 --> 14:34.756
I don't know.

14:34.832 --> 14:37.676
I'd have to hear her sing "La
Bamba" to tell you for sure.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.146
You want a cherry in that?

14:40.170 --> 14:42.097
How about a shot of rum?

14:42.131 --> 14:43.400
Jody.

14:43.424 --> 14:45.026
Hey, it's just an idea.

14:45.050 --> 14:46.935
Hey, you guys got any
smokes back there?

14:48.053 --> 14:50.147
- Yeah.
- So get me a pack.

14:50.389 --> 14:51.899
Come on, quick, while
no one's looking.

14:54.226 --> 14:55.161
Come on, Claud.

14:55.185 --> 14:56.737
Do I have to do everything?

15:05.738 --> 15:07.706
Darts Ultra-Lights
okay with you?

15:24.423 --> 15:25.807
You coming?

15:32.181 --> 15:33.607
Justin. Good.

15:33.891 --> 15:36.026
You wanna give me a hand here?

15:36.143 --> 15:38.204
Oh, yeah, we had to change
the number for the hotline.

15:38.228 --> 15:40.916
Apparently it's one digit off
from some Chinese takeout place.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.784
We've been getting lots of
orders for moo goo gai pan.

15:46.612 --> 15:47.788
What?

15:52.326 --> 15:55.462
You touch her again,
your life's over.

16:03.087 --> 16:04.689
Uh, why are we here?

16:04.713 --> 16:06.858
We just need to pick
up a few things.

16:06.882 --> 16:08.735
We do? What kind of things?

16:08.759 --> 16:10.602
Sweaters, for one.

16:10.928 --> 16:13.146
Ew. Yellow is not your color.

16:13.263 --> 16:14.564
Sweaters?

16:14.890 --> 16:16.191
I don't need a sweater.

16:16.266 --> 16:17.985
You will when we go skiing.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.956
Look, my parents are making
me go with them next weekend,

16:20.980 --> 16:22.540
so I asked if I
could invite you.

16:22.564 --> 16:23.959
You're autumn, aren't you?

16:23.983 --> 16:25.502
Green. Ooh, green is perfect.

16:25.526 --> 16:27.869
They love the idea.
Let's go look at skis.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.038
Wait a minute. Sarah.

16:30.447 --> 16:32.040
Sarah, slow down a second here.

16:32.908 --> 16:34.668
I can't afford to go skiing.

16:34.785 --> 16:36.503
Are you listening to me?

16:36.662 --> 16:38.014
My parents said it was okay.

16:38.038 --> 16:40.215
That means you don't
have to afford anything.

16:40.249 --> 16:42.686
We can ski all day, sit
by the fire at night.

16:42.710 --> 16:44.845
Drink hot cocoa. It'll be great.

16:47.297 --> 16:48.932
It's... It's too much.

16:49.133 --> 16:52.436
It's too much.

16:53.387 --> 16:55.532
Bailey, did I tell you
that the earrings

16:55.556 --> 16:56.866
were my absolute favorite gift?

16:56.890 --> 16:58.567
I've had, like, 15 compliments.

16:58.767 --> 17:01.486
So now I wanna do something
nice for you, okay?

17:01.687 --> 17:04.207
Besides, it's gonna be pretty miserable
if it's just me and my parents

17:04.231 --> 17:06.835
walking around, pretending
everything's okay when it isn't.

17:06.858 --> 17:08.535
And I'm not sure I'm
ready for that.

17:09.569 --> 17:11.204
But if you come with me...

17:13.824 --> 17:15.291
I pay for the cocoa?

17:15.367 --> 17:16.710
Okay.

17:18.203 --> 17:19.588
Let's try on some skis.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.351
Do you know why I got called in?

17:23.375 --> 17:25.301
'Cause if it's about
missing classes...

17:25.461 --> 17:28.648
Sorry. You're going to have to wait, though.
She's got someone in there with her.

17:28.672 --> 17:29.890
Ah.

17:30.966 --> 17:32.601
I truly don't get it, Enid.

17:33.469 --> 17:35.687
I mean, we've always had
a terrific relationship.

17:36.930 --> 17:38.899
She'd stay after class.
We'd talk.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.328
And I'd try to make her
feel like I was a friend,

17:42.352 --> 17:45.447
her not having a dad and all.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.167
Maybe that was my mistake.

17:47.191 --> 17:49.242
Maybe she misinterpreted that.

17:50.569 --> 17:51.870
Oh, God.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.955
Now that I think about it,

17:54.698 --> 17:59.920
her work lately has been
kind of sexually explicit.

18:01.205 --> 18:03.298
I never thought it had
anything to do with me.

18:05.959 --> 18:07.427
I promise you,

18:07.503 --> 18:09.513
we'll get to the bottom of this.

18:11.548 --> 18:14.518
Maybe she's trying to make her
boyfriend jealous. I don't know.

18:20.182 --> 18:21.483
Julia.

18:23.018 --> 18:24.954
Then... boom, right?

18:24.978 --> 18:27.082
We're all headed down
the slopes backwards.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.209
That's when the guy
takes the picture.

18:29.233 --> 18:30.450
You're kidding!

18:30.692 --> 18:32.003
No. I think I have a copy of it.

18:32.027 --> 18:33.129
My mom saves all that stuff.

18:33.153 --> 18:35.381
Sarah? Oh. Hi, Bailey.

18:35.405 --> 18:36.341
Hey.

18:36.365 --> 18:40.303
Oh, Sarah. We just got a
call from American Express.

18:40.327 --> 18:42.421
They thought maybe
your card was stolen.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.005
Stolen?

18:44.873 --> 18:46.476
God, I hope not. I just used it.

18:46.500 --> 18:50.021
They said there was a lot of
unusual activity on the account.

18:50.045 --> 18:51.805
Jewelry. Sporting goods.

18:52.422 --> 18:54.099
It came to over $1000.

18:54.174 --> 18:56.194
Oh. Yeah. Yeah, that was me.

18:56.218 --> 18:57.894
I needed a few
things for the trip.

18:58.387 --> 18:59.563
Is that a problem?

19:00.139 --> 19:01.699
It's just

19:01.723 --> 19:04.077
a lot of money, sweetheart.

19:04.101 --> 19:07.112
Well, why would you give me a charge
card if you didn't want me to use it?

19:07.229 --> 19:09.072
Well, don't you think this is

19:10.190 --> 19:11.491
a little excessive?

19:12.192 --> 19:13.368
Oh.

19:14.027 --> 19:15.912
Oh, okay. I understand.

19:17.030 --> 19:18.248
Um...

19:18.866 --> 19:20.709
we could still take
this stuff back.

19:21.118 --> 19:23.680
Yeah, we can take the car back,
too, if that's what you want.

19:23.704 --> 19:24.889
Of course not.

19:24.913 --> 19:26.224
I completely
understand if you guys

19:26.248 --> 19:27.308
don't want me to
have this stuff.

19:27.332 --> 19:29.134
It's not that, Sarah.
It's just...

19:31.044 --> 19:34.181
Well, try to be a little bit more careful.
That's all.

19:34.423 --> 19:35.599
Okay?

19:36.633 --> 19:37.809
Sure.

19:38.677 --> 19:39.811
Whatever.

19:40.971 --> 19:43.408
I don't know, there's Comet,

19:43.432 --> 19:45.192
uh, Blitzen,

19:45.517 --> 19:47.412
Q-Tip? Cupid?

19:47.436 --> 19:48.997
Oh, who cares? There's
eight of them.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.957
Don't make me laugh.
This sucker's heavy.

19:50.981 --> 19:52.917
Hey, when I get a
tree, I get a tree.

19:52.941 --> 19:54.868
I could have guessed
that about you.

19:54.902 --> 19:56.661
What does that mean?
Watch your step.

19:57.112 --> 19:59.080
Just means that you don't
do anything halfway.

19:59.364 --> 20:01.208
Okay. I can accept that.

20:01.867 --> 20:03.469
- All right.
- Okay.

20:03.493 --> 20:05.086
One...

20:05.162 --> 20:06.723
- Two...
- Two...

20:06.747 --> 20:08.882
- Three!
- Ugh.

20:08.999 --> 20:11.218
Ooh. Ha, ha!

20:11.460 --> 20:12.802
All right.

20:21.094 --> 20:22.812
Oh, Charlie.

20:22.888 --> 20:24.564
No, no.

20:25.307 --> 20:28.068
Sorry. Wrong answer.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.446
Hey, come... Come on.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.295
Why not?

20:37.319 --> 20:39.621
Just because, okay?

20:41.281 --> 20:43.041
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:43.492 --> 20:46.044
What? Who asked out who tonight?

20:46.245 --> 20:48.880
I asked you to do
a favor for me.

20:49.831 --> 20:52.810
Oh, look, maybe you got the
wrong idea or something,

20:52.834 --> 20:54.386
but I, um...

20:54.920 --> 20:58.733
I'm not interested
in this with you.

20:58.757 --> 21:00.276
I mean, I'm just... I'm not.

21:00.300 --> 21:02.528
I mean, you're a nice guy
and everything, but...

21:02.552 --> 21:03.895
You know what? I got it.

21:04.513 --> 21:05.897
You made your point.

21:09.434 --> 21:11.194
I'm gonna go dump this.

21:17.317 --> 21:18.660
Good night.

21:34.251 --> 21:35.802
Do you know what you did?

21:36.295 --> 21:38.523
Do you have any
idea what you did?

21:38.547 --> 21:39.440
Hey.

21:39.464 --> 21:41.818
You just go to him. You don't tell me.
You just...

21:41.842 --> 21:43.643
I mean, who asked you to?

21:44.177 --> 21:46.563
This was my problem, not yours,

21:46.680 --> 21:48.324
and I didn't want
anybody else to know,

21:48.348 --> 21:50.025
and now people do.

21:50.225 --> 21:51.744
I'm in my house, and I get...

21:51.768 --> 21:52.902
Jule, Jule...

21:53.103 --> 21:56.708
Okay, I do not know what
you are talking about.

21:56.732 --> 21:58.158
Stickley.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.701
He went to her.

22:01.028 --> 22:02.579
Wait. He went to her?

22:03.113 --> 22:04.456
And... And what?

22:05.532 --> 22:08.460
And he said that I was
coming on to him.

22:09.328 --> 22:10.430
He what?

22:10.454 --> 22:13.641
You... But you set
it straight, right?

22:13.665 --> 22:14.841
I mean, you told her?

22:16.209 --> 22:19.471
- Right?
- No, okay? No, I didn't.

22:20.964 --> 22:22.390
I don't know, I just...

22:22.799 --> 22:25.727
I think that maybe it wasn't
100 percent his fault.

22:25.761 --> 22:27.645
What, are you kidding?

22:28.847 --> 22:30.190
I don't know.

22:32.684 --> 22:34.454
I don't know.

22:34.478 --> 22:35.737
Julia.

22:35.979 --> 22:37.957
I-I don't get it.

22:37.981 --> 22:39.792
I mean, I really...

22:39.816 --> 22:41.210
Do you remember
after the wedding?

22:41.234 --> 22:42.452
After we, um...

22:45.113 --> 22:48.384
I ran into Nina the next
morning at the lockers,

22:48.408 --> 22:52.504
and she just looked
at me, and she knew.

22:53.413 --> 22:56.007
I mean, she came right
up to me, and she said,

22:56.041 --> 22:58.093
"You're not a virgin
anymore, are you?"

23:01.254 --> 23:03.848
I didn't see anything
different about me.

23:04.132 --> 23:05.809
But she did.

23:10.180 --> 23:12.941
What if I'm giving off
some kind of signal?

23:15.310 --> 23:16.486
Like what?

23:16.978 --> 23:18.488
Sexual radar?

23:19.981 --> 23:21.825
That's nuts. You know it.

23:22.025 --> 23:24.369
Justin, it doesn't
make any sense.

23:25.654 --> 23:28.257
I mean, he has always
been so supportive

23:28.281 --> 23:30.125
and so great.

23:30.534 --> 23:32.053
I mean, why would it happen now?

23:32.077 --> 23:34.587
I mean, why all of a sudden?

23:42.170 --> 23:44.347
The only thing that
has changed is me.

23:48.844 --> 23:52.397
Hey. Hey.

23:53.598 --> 23:55.900
I, um, just wanted
to take a pulse.

23:56.309 --> 23:57.694
Are we cool?

23:58.603 --> 24:01.906
We're cool, and you're
10 minutes late.

24:05.068 --> 24:07.004
Listen, you ought to
check out the schedule,

24:07.028 --> 24:08.913
'cause I had to move a
couple of things around.

24:17.164 --> 24:19.183
Moved things around?

24:19.207 --> 24:20.758
You cut half my hours.

24:21.251 --> 24:24.762
Yeah, look, um, I'm
sorry about that,

24:24.796 --> 24:27.066
but I'm carrying too
much help on this shift.

24:27.090 --> 24:29.684
It's not like they're banging
down the doors around here.

24:31.011 --> 24:33.188
I can't make my tuition on this.

24:34.681 --> 24:37.618
Are you, um... cutting
Parker's hours

24:37.642 --> 24:38.860
or Jason's?

24:39.394 --> 24:41.247
Well, Shelly, you were
the last person hired.

24:41.271 --> 24:45.033
Mmm. And the first one that
wouldn't go to bed with you.

24:45.233 --> 24:47.535
Hey. That is out of line.

24:47.986 --> 24:49.287
I'm still your boss.

24:49.321 --> 24:52.165
God, it is so obvious.

24:52.449 --> 24:53.676
I won't put out,

24:53.700 --> 24:55.011
so now you're
getting back at me.

24:55.035 --> 24:57.170
No, see, that's not true.

24:57.621 --> 24:59.140
'Cause if I was
getting back at you,

24:59.164 --> 25:00.892
I'd tell you that
you're a lousy waitress

25:00.916 --> 25:02.143
and that the only
reason I've kept you

25:02.167 --> 25:04.177
working here this long
is for the babe value.

25:19.226 --> 25:22.278
Oh, another minute and
you would've missed me.

25:23.355 --> 25:24.290
Come on in.

25:24.314 --> 25:25.865
I won't keep you long.

25:26.191 --> 25:27.575
You got my message?

25:28.526 --> 25:30.537
I left it with your
homeroom teacher.

25:31.404 --> 25:33.414
You cut classes again today?

25:33.698 --> 25:35.092
Please don't be upset with me.

25:35.116 --> 25:37.001
I'm not upset with you, Julia.

25:37.619 --> 25:39.295
I'm concerned.

25:40.038 --> 25:42.257
You're one of my best students,

25:42.582 --> 25:45.093
and Allen is one of
my best teachers.

25:46.211 --> 25:47.521
I keep thinking

25:47.545 --> 25:49.722
maybe I haven't heard
the whole story.

25:51.091 --> 25:53.685
Is there anything you
want to say to me today?

25:56.179 --> 25:59.607
What can we do so that I never
have to think about this again?

26:00.267 --> 26:02.110
So that it goes away?

26:03.853 --> 26:05.655
You understand that

26:06.648 --> 26:09.701
once you say that, the
matter is closed.

26:11.361 --> 26:14.289
I'd appreciate it if you'd
let me out of his class.

26:15.282 --> 26:17.125
It's the middle
of the term, I...

26:18.660 --> 26:20.628
You'd have to take
an incomplete.

26:20.745 --> 26:22.380
That's fine. Whatever.

26:24.374 --> 26:25.393
Julia, you know...

26:25.417 --> 26:26.968
Please, Ms. Stickley.

26:28.962 --> 26:30.305
I'm sorry.

26:33.842 --> 26:35.518
Claudia?

26:35.885 --> 26:37.071
Claudia, have you
seen the checkbook?

26:37.095 --> 26:38.072
Oops!

26:38.096 --> 26:39.689
What the hell?

26:40.932 --> 26:42.233
Rum?

26:42.559 --> 26:43.776
Rum?

26:44.144 --> 26:46.487
Out of there. Now!

26:46.521 --> 26:50.376
I... I'm not so sure I
can walk right now.

26:50.400 --> 26:51.377
Out.

26:51.401 --> 26:52.336
Stop yelling.

26:52.360 --> 26:53.754
Out! Out.

26:53.778 --> 26:55.163
You're yelling.

26:56.114 --> 26:58.384
You are intensely good-looking.
Do you know that?

26:58.408 --> 27:00.293
First of all, I am
calling your parents.

27:00.994 --> 27:02.879
Oh. You know what?

27:02.954 --> 27:05.006
My mom would love you.

27:05.957 --> 27:07.342
Where's the john?

27:08.126 --> 27:09.927
By the kitchen.

27:10.545 --> 27:11.814
What the hell do you...

27:11.838 --> 27:14.849
You... You are 12, okay?

27:15.091 --> 27:17.769
You're 12!

27:18.178 --> 27:19.604
You know what, Char?

27:20.972 --> 27:24.901
I'm sure you got a lot to
say about this, and...

27:24.934 --> 27:27.747
Well, it'll probably
take a while,

27:27.771 --> 27:30.156
but before you get started,

27:31.775 --> 27:33.868
I kind of gotta throw up.

27:38.448 --> 27:40.625
Thanks for this.

27:40.700 --> 27:43.419
This feels more like my birthday
than my actual birthday did.

27:43.703 --> 27:45.046
Do we get cake?

27:45.455 --> 27:46.849
Of course you're getting cake.

27:46.873 --> 27:49.060
Good, because the other night

27:49.084 --> 27:50.770
when they brought out the
cake with all the candles

27:50.794 --> 27:52.470
and sang "Happy Birthday"

27:52.587 --> 27:54.722
and told me to make
a wish, I didn't.

27:55.548 --> 27:57.266
Because it just
didn't feel right.

27:57.884 --> 28:00.061
So I decided to save
it for tonight.

28:00.678 --> 28:02.656
Great. That's great.

28:02.680 --> 28:04.742
- I wore my earrings, see?
- Yes.

28:04.766 --> 28:06.494
I was hoping you'd
wear your sweater,

28:06.518 --> 28:08.695
but I guess you're probably
saving it for the trip.

28:09.437 --> 28:10.655
Actually,

28:11.981 --> 28:13.366
I kind of took it back.

28:14.150 --> 28:15.368
Oh.

28:16.236 --> 28:17.338
You didn't like it?

28:17.362 --> 28:18.705
Just...

28:20.198 --> 28:22.375
It just feels kind of weird.

28:22.575 --> 28:24.335
You know, you buying
me all this stuff.

28:25.161 --> 28:26.931
No, no. I told you I want to.

28:26.955 --> 28:29.298
I know. I know that,
and that's great.

28:29.374 --> 28:31.018
But it's starting to feel like

28:31.042 --> 28:34.137
part of you really wants
to give me these things,

28:35.088 --> 28:38.192
and the other part of
you is just doing it

28:38.216 --> 28:39.559
to get back at your parents.

28:42.512 --> 28:43.938
Wow.

28:44.431 --> 28:46.983
God, I had no idea I was
dating Sigmund Freud.

28:47.267 --> 28:49.485
Come on, Sarah, you
heard what they said.

28:49.602 --> 28:51.988
And I don't know what's going
on with you guys. I don't.

28:52.439 --> 28:54.500
But do I know you're
spending too much.

28:54.524 --> 28:55.751
And I shouldn't be
spending their money

28:55.775 --> 28:57.837
because I'm not really their daughter?
Is that it?

28:57.861 --> 28:59.213
God, Bailey, you sound
just like them.

28:59.237 --> 29:00.256
No, that is...

29:00.280 --> 29:03.708
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you... ♪</i>

29:03.867 --> 29:07.304
It's just, it feels like you're
using me to punish them.

29:07.328 --> 29:08.973
For lying to you, I guess, and...

29:08.997 --> 29:10.599
- You can shut up now.
- Sarah!

29:10.623 --> 29:11.883
No, I get it, okay?

29:12.041 --> 29:13.217
Excuse me.

29:17.380 --> 29:18.941
I'm thinking maybe we
should talk about this.

29:18.965 --> 29:19.859
What's to talk about?

29:19.883 --> 29:21.434
You've obviously got
it all figured out.

29:22.802 --> 29:23.936
Your car.

29:24.262 --> 29:25.646
Oh, man.

29:27.724 --> 29:29.067
Wow.

29:30.185 --> 29:32.195
I'll go call the police.

29:32.437 --> 29:35.740
Why? Why? It's not like
they can do anything.

29:36.107 --> 29:38.127
And it's not like I
care about this stuff,

29:38.151 --> 29:39.577
because it's just stuff.

29:40.653 --> 29:41.913
So you're right.

29:41.946 --> 29:43.632
You know, we should
take it all back.

29:43.656 --> 29:45.426
The earrings, the
skis, the stupid car.

29:45.450 --> 29:46.510
'Cause who really cares, right?

29:46.534 --> 29:48.461
I mean, who gives a
damn about any of it?

29:51.206 --> 29:52.632
Maybe somebody will steal it.

29:52.832 --> 29:54.393
- Taxi!
- Sarah.

29:54.417 --> 29:55.843
Sarah, wait a second!

29:56.753 --> 29:58.262
Sarah!

30:09.599 --> 30:11.275
Here you go.

30:14.270 --> 30:15.696
Drink it.

30:17.232 --> 30:18.574
What is it?

30:18.817 --> 30:20.118
Bitters and soda.

30:21.110 --> 30:22.245
Pass.

30:22.445 --> 30:23.663
Now!

30:30.203 --> 30:32.588
I think I better move
closer to the bathroom.

30:34.332 --> 30:36.676
What were you thinking
about, Claud? Huh?

30:37.335 --> 30:38.511
Can you tell me that?

30:38.670 --> 30:40.179
I don't know, I just...

30:42.048 --> 30:44.559
I guess it just seemed
kind of funny and...

30:44.968 --> 30:46.853
I mean, why do you do it?

30:47.011 --> 30:49.490
I don't have to answer that.
I'm twice as old as you are.

30:49.514 --> 30:51.607
But don't you do it for fun?

30:52.016 --> 30:53.359
That's different.

30:53.518 --> 30:54.453
Why?

30:54.477 --> 30:56.664
'Cause I'm twice as old as you are.
That's why.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.281
And I'm not the one
in trouble here.

30:59.399 --> 31:01.794
You are not drinking
again until you're 21.

31:01.818 --> 31:03.619
Okay, okay, okay.

31:06.030 --> 31:07.258
This Jody friend of yours.

31:07.282 --> 31:09.426
She's... She's a juvenile
delinquent, and I...

31:09.450 --> 31:10.761
Charlie, she's my friend.

31:10.785 --> 31:12.170
This girl is trouble.

31:13.329 --> 31:15.548
You're not hanging out with her anymore.
Do you understand me?

31:17.542 --> 31:18.843
Do you?

31:19.085 --> 31:20.219
Okay.

31:21.170 --> 31:22.471
I won't.

31:24.340 --> 31:25.892
Oh, man.

31:26.301 --> 31:28.102
Just shoot me in the head.

31:45.695 --> 31:46.954
Where did you go?

31:48.364 --> 31:49.665
Nowhere.

31:50.450 --> 31:54.462
I just kind of had the cab driver drive me
up and down Lombard Street over and over.

31:55.121 --> 31:56.849
He thought I was crazy,

31:56.873 --> 31:58.758
but I used to love that
when I was little.

32:03.087 --> 32:04.388
There was a party?

32:04.547 --> 32:07.266
Surprise. Seventy-five people.

32:08.384 --> 32:09.936
They left about a half-hour ago.

32:10.428 --> 32:11.322
You mean you...

32:11.346 --> 32:12.730
Your folks put it together.

32:13.806 --> 32:15.733
Been driving me kind
of nuts about it, but

32:16.309 --> 32:18.402
I guess they just wanted
everything to be perfect.

32:21.189 --> 32:22.448
It's just guilt, Bailey.

32:24.400 --> 32:25.701
I don't think so.

32:27.362 --> 32:29.455
I was just upstairs
with them, and...

32:31.574 --> 32:33.542
I definitely don't
think it's guilt.

32:35.453 --> 32:37.213
I kind of get the
feeling that...

32:38.206 --> 32:39.840
That it might actually be love.

32:41.292 --> 32:42.426
Big time.

32:46.464 --> 32:48.474
They're not my real
parents, Bailey.

32:49.550 --> 32:51.269
That is so weird.

32:51.719 --> 32:54.522
You know, it's not like they have an
obligation to love me or anything.

32:56.182 --> 32:57.566
Maybe not,

32:58.393 --> 33:01.872
but they did make
this, like, huge,

33:01.896 --> 33:03.948
huge choice a few years ago

33:04.524 --> 33:05.741
to love you.

33:07.193 --> 33:11.163
And so you don't have to...

33:12.740 --> 33:14.468
You don't have to test them.

33:14.492 --> 33:18.263
You don't have to see how
much you can get away with,

33:18.287 --> 33:20.891
and you don't have to make them
prove they love you every day,

33:20.915 --> 33:22.925
because they've already
been doing that

33:24.127 --> 33:26.220
for, like, the past 16 years.

33:28.589 --> 33:30.943
They're always gonna
love you, Sarah.

33:30.967 --> 33:32.351
I mean, come on.

33:33.386 --> 33:35.396
How could they
possibly not love you?

33:44.355 --> 33:45.573
I don't get it.

33:46.149 --> 33:47.575
Why didn't you say something?

33:47.900 --> 33:50.379
This teacher makes a pass at you,
and you don't even say anything?

33:50.403 --> 33:52.715
Please Charlie, can you just sign
it and let me drop the class?

33:52.739 --> 33:55.166
- Then what? Then he wins.
- Okay.

33:55.533 --> 33:56.510
Fine, he wins.

33:56.534 --> 33:57.960
Are you gonna sign it or not?

34:00.329 --> 34:02.715
I don't know. I have
to think about it.

34:04.167 --> 34:06.186
Well, get back to me when
you've made up your mind.

34:06.210 --> 34:08.105
Why are you letting some
creep get away with this?

34:08.129 --> 34:10.306
Because maybe it was my fault.

34:11.799 --> 34:13.777
Something I did

34:13.801 --> 34:15.154
or said or wore.

34:15.178 --> 34:16.812
I mean, maybe I caused this.

34:16.846 --> 34:19.231
You throwing yourself
at a teacher?

34:20.141 --> 34:21.326
No way in hell.

34:21.350 --> 34:23.027
It... It's not who you are.

34:23.728 --> 34:24.862
Then why?

34:26.063 --> 34:28.375
Probably he's one of those jerks

34:28.399 --> 34:31.452
who sees a pretty girl and
thinks, "I'm entitled,"

34:32.360 --> 34:33.536
you know?

34:34.237 --> 34:35.466
"That's for me."

34:35.489 --> 34:37.551
Never mind what the
girl thinks or wants.

34:37.574 --> 34:39.335
I know plenty of those guys.

34:39.952 --> 34:42.514
And the fact that he's,
what, twice your age?

34:42.538 --> 34:43.797
More?

34:43.915 --> 34:46.060
And he's got that
authority thing going on.

34:46.083 --> 34:48.177
He knows he can hold
stuff over you.

34:49.295 --> 34:51.472
That just makes
it so much worse.

34:54.717 --> 34:55.976
Trying to...

34:58.471 --> 35:01.732
Trying to take advantage of...

35:02.058 --> 35:04.276
Of someone like that.
It's just...

35:08.606 --> 35:12.660
Guys do that sometimes.
We just...

35:15.696 --> 35:18.082
It's such a lousy thing to do.

35:19.534 --> 35:21.877
Such a lousy thing to do to you.

35:24.163 --> 35:25.506
Yeah.

35:27.708 --> 35:29.844
Do you want me to go up to
school, talk to anybody?

35:31.420 --> 35:33.889
Mm-mm. No.

35:35.299 --> 35:36.809
Want me to beat him up?

35:38.636 --> 35:39.812
I'm your big brother.

35:39.929 --> 35:41.230
It's in the job description.

35:47.311 --> 35:49.081
This is "Geo" pardy.

35:49.105 --> 35:50.990
Geography meets Jeopardy.

35:52.817 --> 35:55.327
Well, Claudia, are you
feeling all right?

35:57.405 --> 35:59.832
I'm feeling kind of ragged.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.585
I, uh...

36:03.536 --> 36:06.213
I have this note
from my brother.

36:11.043 --> 36:12.928
Well, you wanna go see
the school nurse?

36:13.588 --> 36:15.890
I'm thinking that
might be a good idea.

36:23.306 --> 36:25.107
Let's blow this funeral parlor.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.291
Got any smokes?

36:32.315 --> 36:33.750
Man, I'm jonesin'.

36:33.774 --> 36:35.201
You crack me up.

36:44.535 --> 36:46.045
Hey.

36:46.495 --> 36:48.005
Hey.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.716
I, uh...

36:51.334 --> 36:52.968
I brought your last check.

36:54.629 --> 36:57.181
Um, actually, I hope that it
won't be your last check.

36:57.298 --> 37:00.434
I'd like you to come back to work.
Full-time, you name it.

37:01.761 --> 37:03.989
I know that I was
horrible to you

37:04.013 --> 37:07.483
and that I owe you
this huge apology.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.078
Yeah, I was
definitely attracted,

37:10.102 --> 37:12.112
but you said no, and
that should've been it.

37:14.857 --> 37:17.326
I couldn't even tell you
why I went off on you.

37:17.860 --> 37:19.495
Who are you so mad at?

37:19.695 --> 37:20.589
What?

37:20.613 --> 37:22.665
It's in your eyes.
You're like this

37:23.074 --> 37:24.792
angry guy.

37:25.534 --> 37:27.179
- I'm not.
- Yeah.

37:27.203 --> 37:28.420
Yeah, you are.

37:29.413 --> 37:31.558
Come on, I can't
be the first girl

37:31.582 --> 37:32.726
that's ever said no to you.

37:32.750 --> 37:35.553
I mean, big deal,
but you just...

37:37.630 --> 37:39.098
It's no excuse.

37:40.049 --> 37:43.561
There's... There's no excuse
for the way you treated me.

37:50.977 --> 37:53.288
See, it has magic
repellent powers.

37:53.312 --> 37:55.656
Oh. Hmm.

37:56.232 --> 37:59.753
Yeah, and if anybody comes near
you who's creepy or weird,

37:59.777 --> 38:02.329
it'll zap them with
invisible shock rays.

38:02.738 --> 38:04.132
- I'm dead serious.
- You're crazy.

38:04.156 --> 38:05.791
It will.

38:06.575 --> 38:07.835
Justin, um,

38:08.494 --> 38:10.087
I'm gonna...

38:10.830 --> 38:12.339
Unfinished business.

38:12.373 --> 38:13.716
Okay.

38:25.594 --> 38:27.146
I don't know what's worse.

38:27.972 --> 38:29.074
What you did to me

38:29.098 --> 38:32.651
or that you lied about it, or
that you made me doubt myself.

38:34.687 --> 38:36.456
I don't think this
is such a good idea,

38:36.480 --> 38:38.282
under the circumstances,
your being here.

38:40.943 --> 38:42.244
You're worried.

38:44.613 --> 38:45.873
You should be.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.587
Maybe you thought that I
was just gonna go away.

38:52.246 --> 38:54.256
I thought that,
too, but I'm not.

38:55.166 --> 38:57.968
I'm gonna go talk to Ms.
Stickley, and

38:58.461 --> 39:01.305
I'm not gonna let you get
away with what you did to me.

39:01.756 --> 39:04.276
Julia, I don't know what
you think happened, but...

39:04.300 --> 39:08.520
Do you have any idea how much I
loved it here, in your class?

39:09.305 --> 39:12.200
I mean, this stupid, ugly room

39:12.224 --> 39:13.901
was one of my favorite places.

39:14.060 --> 39:15.235
Ever.

39:15.853 --> 39:17.363
But you ruined that.

39:20.566 --> 39:24.662
Because the truth is, there really isn't anything
that I would want to learn from you anymore.

39:59.980 --> 40:01.917
<i>Hi, I can't come to
the phone right now,</i>

40:01.941 --> 40:03.210
<i>but I wanna talk to you.</i>

40:03.234 --> 40:04.952
<i>Please leave a message
after the beep.</i>

40:07.113 --> 40:08.288
Hi.

40:08.447 --> 40:09.623
Uh...

40:10.658 --> 40:11.959
God.

40:12.451 --> 40:14.962
Um, I wasn't gonna...

40:15.996 --> 40:18.642
<i>I kind of just wanted to hear
your voice on the machine,</i>

40:18.666 --> 40:22.302
<i>and, uh... I forgot to hang up.</i>

40:24.463 --> 40:25.889
<i>Um...</i>

40:27.508 --> 40:28.976
<i>I hope you're okay.</i>

40:29.218 --> 40:30.728
<i>I'm, uh...</i>

40:31.303 --> 40:34.440
<i>I'm kind of a mess, if that
makes you feel any better.</i>

40:38.185 --> 40:39.445
I'm sorry.

40:39.687 --> 40:40.946
This is, uh...

40:43.190 --> 40:44.450
I shouldn't have...

41:00.541 --> 41:01.518
Okay.

41:01.542 --> 41:03.302
Okay, okay. It's
right over here.

41:03.586 --> 41:04.563
Careful.

41:04.587 --> 41:05.804
Oh!

41:05.963 --> 41:07.097
Okay.

41:08.132 --> 41:09.025
Where are we going?

41:09.049 --> 41:10.517
Right over here.

41:12.011 --> 41:13.771
Okay. Close your eyes.

41:16.182 --> 41:17.816
- Right over here.
- Okay.

41:19.435 --> 41:21.528
Okay. Open your eyes.

41:23.355 --> 41:24.865
Happy belated birthday.

41:26.859 --> 41:28.243
Wow.

41:29.195 --> 41:30.547
Well, it's beautiful,

41:30.571 --> 41:32.080
but I don't get it.

41:32.573 --> 41:33.791
Look straight up.

41:38.037 --> 41:39.421
No, no, wait.

41:40.915 --> 41:42.591
Wait a second.

41:44.001 --> 41:45.385
Here, this way.

41:46.545 --> 41:48.180
It's right between...

41:48.714 --> 41:50.682
Gemini and Orion.

41:51.675 --> 41:53.227
What am I looking for?

41:55.179 --> 41:56.355
Your star.

41:57.473 --> 41:58.700
My what?

41:58.724 --> 42:00.076
It's my birthday gift to you.

42:00.100 --> 42:01.453
I sent in this form
and everything.

42:01.477 --> 42:04.372
And I mean, it's not
the most expensive

42:04.396 --> 42:06.615
birthday gift in the
world, but, anyway,

42:07.608 --> 42:09.034
there's this star up there

42:10.069 --> 42:11.286
named Sarah.

42:11.737 --> 42:13.215
And that's not gonna change,

42:13.239 --> 42:14.382
and that's not gonna go away

42:14.406 --> 42:15.999
'cause I have a certificate.

42:21.163 --> 42:22.307
So...

42:22.331 --> 42:23.433
no matter what happens,

42:23.457 --> 42:26.468
it's gonna be there for, like,
millions and millions of years.

42:28.003 --> 42:29.388
Right up there.

42:33.259 --> 42:35.435
You can't see it,
but it's there.

42:35.553 --> 42:37.312
I promise.

42:38.639 --> 42:40.107
Wow.

42:40.391 --> 42:42.442
Wow.

42:50.192 --> 42:51.493
Go ahead.

42:51.735 --> 42:53.537
You never got to make your wish.

42:53.988 --> 42:55.497
Okay.
