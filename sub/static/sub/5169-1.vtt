02:42.150 --> 02:44.414
My God, it's hot.

02:44.719 --> 02:48.086
Stepped out of the shower
and started sweating again.

02:48.890 --> 02:50.619
Still burning?

02:51.025 --> 02:52.993
Jesus, it's bigger.

02:54.929 --> 02:56.021
What is it?

02:56.231 --> 02:59.928
It's the Seawater Inn. My family
used to eat dinner there 25 years ago.

03:00.168 --> 03:02.729
Now somebody's torched it
to clear the lot.

03:02.972 --> 03:06.601
- It's a shame.
- Probably one of my clients.

03:08.277 --> 03:09.608
I'm leaving.

03:11.113 --> 03:13.513
What do you care?
You're watching the fire.

03:14.083 --> 03:15.050
You're done with me.

03:16.418 --> 03:18.215
You've had your fun.
You're spent.

03:19.021 --> 03:21.148
My history is burning up out there.

03:21.557 --> 03:23.525
I don't mind. I'm leaving.

03:24.693 --> 03:27.662
I'm just getting into my uniform here.

03:29.798 --> 03:32.824
Why do they make these
damn skirts so hard to zip?

03:38.007 --> 03:40.909
"You're spent"?
Where did you hear that?

03:49.252 --> 03:52.585
Mr. Racine, I no longer care
whether these alleged toilets...

03:52.789 --> 03:55.519
...were ever actually en route
from Indiana or not.

03:55.759 --> 03:58.091
I think we're wasting our time here.

03:58.328 --> 04:02.025
Now, it's pretty clear that your client
has attempted to defraud the county...

04:02.232 --> 04:04.757
...in a not very ingenious manner.

04:05.001 --> 04:08.801
The assistant prosecutor has made
what I consider a generous offer.

04:09.005 --> 04:11.803
Given that you failed to offer
even the semblance of a defense...

04:12.008 --> 04:14.476
Judge, perhaps when
I've presented all the evidence...

04:14.711 --> 04:17.839
Listen, if I were you,
I would recommend to your client...

04:18.048 --> 04:20.677
...that he quickly do
as Mr. Lowenstein here has suggested:

04:21.218 --> 04:23.982
Plead nolo contendere,
file chapter 11...

04:24.221 --> 04:28.351
...and agree to never do business
with Okeelanta County again.

04:29.393 --> 04:32.419
- You look favorably on that?
- He could walk.

04:32.663 --> 04:37.032
But don't test my patience for even five
more minutes. If he hesitates, I'll nail him.

04:37.234 --> 04:38.667
I'll talk to him.

04:38.970 --> 04:40.369
And Mr. Racine...

04:41.973 --> 04:44.407
...the next time you come
into my courtroom...

04:44.608 --> 04:47.406
...I hope you've got either
a better defense...

04:47.611 --> 04:50.102
...or a better class of client.

04:50.948 --> 04:53.041
Thank you, Your Honor.

05:08.667 --> 05:11.636
I've underestimated you, Ned.
I don't know why it took me so long.

05:11.870 --> 05:13.963
You started using your incompetence
as a weapon.

05:14.206 --> 05:18.142
My defense was evolving
and you guys got scared.

05:18.377 --> 05:21.175
Costanza doesn't like me.
What'd I ever do to him? Hey, Danny.

05:21.380 --> 05:23.644
He's unhappy.
He thinks he belongs in circuit court.

05:23.882 --> 05:26.544
Here he is in the state
where there's top-notch corruption...

05:26.752 --> 05:28.549
...and he's stuck
with the county toilets.

05:28.787 --> 05:32.450
Surprised you weren't in on that toilet
caper. Could've been your quick score.

05:32.658 --> 05:36.059
Or maybe Costanza was in on it.
That's why he was so mad.

05:36.295 --> 05:39.492
What's the good word from
the hallow halls of justice? Anything juicy?

05:39.732 --> 05:43.224
Maybe Stella was in on it. When will
you get a real air conditioner in here?

05:43.469 --> 05:45.733
You don't like it,
there are lots of other places.

05:45.972 --> 05:48.270
They don't have you.
I've got to go.

05:50.209 --> 05:52.040
You can't buy me.

05:52.278 --> 05:54.178
I don't come cheap.

05:55.648 --> 05:57.081
Lowenstein, you're a fag.

05:57.750 --> 06:00.685
- Why does he do that?
- He's pretty good. That's the weird part.

06:00.920 --> 06:03.320
- You hear about Dr. Block?
- No. Do I want to?

06:03.556 --> 06:05.023
Agnes Marshall.

06:05.224 --> 06:07.920
It must have been Mrs. Block's idea,
some kind of punishment.

06:08.161 --> 06:10.288
That's right.
How did you know that?

06:10.497 --> 06:13.330
Christ, you are better plugged in
than I am.

06:13.567 --> 06:16.661
I suppose you know about
Mrs. Block's friend over in Ocean Grove.

06:16.904 --> 06:20.772
Stella, this is beneath even you.
Things must be slow.

06:22.076 --> 06:23.737
It's the heat.

08:07.884 --> 08:09.818
You can stand here with me
if you want...

08:10.020 --> 08:13.148
...but you'll have to agree
not to talk about the heat.

08:17.227 --> 08:18.888
I'm a married woman.

08:19.129 --> 08:22.724
- Meaning what?
- Meaning I'm not looking for company.

08:22.966 --> 08:25.491
Then you should've said,
"I'm a happily married woman."

08:25.702 --> 08:27.169
That's my business.

08:27.404 --> 08:28.371
What?

08:28.605 --> 08:31.506
- How happy I am.
- And how happy is that?

08:32.676 --> 08:34.143
Not too smart, are you?

08:35.544 --> 08:36.807
I like that in a man.

08:37.013 --> 08:40.779
What else do you like? Lazy?
Ugly? Horny? I've got them all.

08:41.017 --> 08:42.918
You don't look lazy.

08:44.488 --> 08:47.946
Tell me, does chat like this
work with most women?

08:48.159 --> 08:50.252
Some, if they haven't been around much.

08:50.494 --> 08:53.019
I wondered.
Thought maybe I was out of touch.

08:53.264 --> 08:57.462
- Can I buy you a drink?
- I told you, I've got a husband.

08:57.702 --> 09:00.899
- I'll buy him one too.
- He's out of town.

09:01.239 --> 09:04.333
My favorite kind.
We'll drink to him.

09:04.575 --> 09:06.873
He only comes up on weekends.

09:07.111 --> 09:09.443
I'm liking him better all the time.

09:13.484 --> 09:16.942
You better take me up on this quick.
In 45 minutes, I'll get up and go away.

09:17.188 --> 09:19.817
Want to buy me something?
I'll take one of those.

09:20.058 --> 09:23.721
- What kind?
- Cherry. Make it two.

09:25.731 --> 09:27.756
You're not staying in Miranda Beach.

09:28.567 --> 09:31.866
- I would have noticed you.
- Is this town that small?

09:37.542 --> 09:39.237
Pinehaven?

09:41.780 --> 09:44.442
You're staying down in Pinehaven.

09:44.683 --> 09:46.116
On the waterway.

09:50.455 --> 09:53.583
- You have a house.
- How do you know that?

09:53.825 --> 09:55.816
You look like Pinehaven.

09:56.061 --> 09:57.552
How does Pinehaven look?

09:58.731 --> 10:02.223
- Well-tended.
- I'm well-tended, all right.

10:03.202 --> 10:04.999
Well-tended.

10:06.472 --> 10:07.837
What about you?

10:08.074 --> 10:09.041
Me?

10:11.044 --> 10:14.013
I need tending. I need
someone to take care of me...

10:14.347 --> 10:18.215
...someone to rub my tired muscles,
smooth out my sheets.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.043
Get married.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.051
I just need it for tonight.

10:25.825 --> 10:27.087
Nice move, Matty.

10:27.327 --> 10:30.728
"Matty"? I like it.
It's right over your heart.

10:30.963 --> 10:34.956
- At least it's cool. I was burning up.
- I asked you not to talk about the heat.

10:35.201 --> 10:38.171
Would you get me a paper towel?
Dip it in some cold water.

10:38.405 --> 10:40.930
Right away.
I'll even wipe it off for you.

10:42.042 --> 10:43.441
You don't want to lick it?

12:47.170 --> 12:49.468
Look who's here.
Isn't this a coincidence.

12:49.706 --> 12:50.798
I know you.

12:51.041 --> 12:53.601
You're the one that doesn't like
to talk about the heat.

12:53.810 --> 12:57.803
- Too bad. I'd tell you about my chimes.
- What about them?

12:58.048 --> 12:59.879
The wind chimes on my porch.

13:00.116 --> 13:03.051
They keep ringing and I go out there,
expecting a cool breeze.

13:03.286 --> 13:05.811
That's what they've always meant,
but not this year.

13:06.056 --> 13:08.116
This year it's just hot air.

13:08.359 --> 13:11.021
Do I remind you of hot air?

13:12.763 --> 13:15.823
Bourbon, any kind, on the rocks.
Do you want another?

13:16.033 --> 13:17.466
Yeah.

13:19.303 --> 13:21.498
- What are you doing in Pinehaven?
- I'm no yokel.

13:21.706 --> 13:23.765
I was all the way to Miami once.

13:24.008 --> 13:28.775
Some men, once they get a whiff of it,
they trail you like a hound.

13:29.113 --> 13:30.978
I'm not that eager.

13:31.449 --> 13:34.111
- What's your name, anyway?
- Ned Racine.

13:34.418 --> 13:36.249
Matty Walker.

13:38.489 --> 13:40.457
- You all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

13:40.691 --> 13:43.888
My temperature runs a couple
of degrees high, around 100.

13:44.128 --> 13:46.597
I don't mind.
It's the engine or something.

13:46.832 --> 13:48.595
Maybe you need a tune-up.

13:48.834 --> 13:51.667
Don't tell me.
You have just the right tool.

13:51.904 --> 13:53.997
I don't talk like that.

14:00.812 --> 14:02.746
How did you find me, Ned?

14:05.984 --> 14:08.350
This is the only joint in Pinehaven.

14:09.655 --> 14:13.557
You shouldn't have come.
You're going to be disappointed.

14:19.731 --> 14:21.130
What did I do?

14:22.635 --> 14:25.263
A lot of them have tried that seat.

14:25.505 --> 14:27.564
You're the first I've let stay.

14:28.775 --> 14:30.743
You must come here a lot.

14:32.045 --> 14:34.980
- Most men are little boys.
- Maybe you should drink at home.

14:35.214 --> 14:38.081
- Too quiet.
- Maybe you shouldn't dress like that.

14:38.318 --> 14:41.913
This is a blouse and skirt.
I don't know what you're talking about.

14:42.121 --> 14:44.419
Then you shouldn't wear that body.

14:47.961 --> 14:49.292
Sometimes, I don't know...

14:50.296 --> 14:54.926
I just get so sick of everything,
I'm not sure I care anymore.

14:56.636 --> 14:58.035
Do you know what I mean, Ned?

15:00.073 --> 15:04.477
I know that sometimes the shit comes down
so heavy I feel I should wear a hat.

15:06.547 --> 15:09.038
Yeah, that's what I mean.

15:12.086 --> 15:13.951
I'm gonna get out of here.
I gotta go home.

15:14.188 --> 15:16.281
- I'll take you.
- I have a car.

15:16.624 --> 15:18.251
I'll follow you.

15:19.560 --> 15:21.494
I want to see the chimes.

15:23.764 --> 15:25.288
You want to see the chimes.

15:26.433 --> 15:27.866
I want to hear them.

15:31.105 --> 15:32.663
That's all.

15:33.273 --> 15:35.241
If I let you, then that's all.

15:35.776 --> 15:38.541
I'm not looking for trouble.

15:40.348 --> 15:41.838
This is my community bar.

15:42.083 --> 15:45.314
I might have to come here
with my husband sometime.

15:45.553 --> 15:49.080
Would you mind leaving before me?
Waiting in your car?

15:49.324 --> 15:50.814
I know it seems silly.

15:51.359 --> 15:54.157
I don't know who you think
we're going to fool.

15:54.863 --> 15:56.956
You've been pretty friendly.

15:59.868 --> 16:02.132
Now, leave me alone.

17:28.792 --> 17:30.817
It's just like my place.

17:59.357 --> 18:00.619
No help?

18:00.858 --> 18:02.348
She goes home nights.

18:02.593 --> 18:04.823
You're not nervous here alone?

18:05.229 --> 18:06.355
No.

18:10.502 --> 18:12.936
You do have chimes.

18:20.212 --> 18:21.201
What's that?

18:22.347 --> 18:24.178
- A gazebo.
- No, no, out there.

18:24.583 --> 18:25.845
A boathouse.

18:26.418 --> 18:27.851
What's in it?

18:28.921 --> 18:30.183
A boat.

18:39.665 --> 18:41.530
It's a mess, really.

18:42.668 --> 18:46.434
There's a old rowboat,
and some lounge chairs, things like that.

18:59.018 --> 19:01.145
I think you should go now.

19:01.754 --> 19:03.244
I just got here.

19:05.291 --> 19:07.555
You've seen them.
Please go.

19:25.479 --> 19:27.276
Thank you. I'm sorry.

19:27.514 --> 19:29.379
I shouldn't have let you come.

19:32.019 --> 19:35.978
- You're not so tough after all, are you?
- No, I'm weak.

21:33.443 --> 21:35.604
Yes. Oh, yes.

22:20.158 --> 22:22.149
Yes, it's so right.

22:23.361 --> 22:25.852
Please, Ned, do it.

23:11.944 --> 23:14.209
How are you doing?
Good walk, right.

23:31.798 --> 23:33.129
Mrs. Singer.

23:34.100 --> 23:35.658
Mrs. Singer.

23:37.137 --> 23:39.628
- I would have gladly come to your house.
- Oh, no.

23:40.140 --> 23:43.701
The doctor said I should walk,
and I did have some shopping.

23:43.943 --> 23:46.673
Not that the quack knows
what he's talking about.

23:47.046 --> 23:51.848
Mr. Racine, I'm just not sure
that his testimony is going to be useful.

23:52.086 --> 23:56.386
Don't worry about it, we'll find
a doctor who's more understanding.

23:56.624 --> 24:00.025
- Is it bad today?
- You just can't imagine.

24:00.261 --> 24:02.695
Nobody can repay me
for the pain I've been through.

24:02.930 --> 24:06.559
How well I know.
We'll sue those reckless bastards dry.

24:06.800 --> 24:08.427
Excuse my language.

24:08.669 --> 24:10.967
No, don't apologize.

24:11.272 --> 24:14.764
You have to have an attitude
like that these days.

24:25.252 --> 24:27.880
I like this place.
It's got a nice feel.

24:28.123 --> 24:30.489
- You were on top.
- So it could use a better mattress.

24:30.725 --> 24:32.989
- See to it, will you?
- Yes, sir.

24:45.941 --> 24:48.432
Give me a break here.
It takes a little while.

24:48.677 --> 24:50.235
It's your own fault.

24:50.478 --> 24:53.072
I never wanted it like this before.

24:53.348 --> 24:55.680
It throws everything else out of whack.

24:56.384 --> 24:58.944
It takes me a good 30 seconds.

24:59.187 --> 25:00.620
Are you sure?

25:00.855 --> 25:03.050
I just want to be sure.

25:17.440 --> 25:18.839
What are you doing?

25:19.075 --> 25:20.235
I have to wash these.

25:20.476 --> 25:21.738
Afraid of your maid?

25:22.345 --> 25:23.505
That's right.

25:24.547 --> 25:26.777
My mother told me,
"Knowledge is power."

25:27.016 --> 25:29.644
This is an interesting interpretation.

25:30.753 --> 25:33.415
Isn't that why you've started
smoking my brand?

25:34.890 --> 25:36.448
No one must know, Ned.

25:37.526 --> 25:40.120
Promise me. No one.

26:00.250 --> 26:02.047
Take it easy, all right?

26:06.023 --> 26:08.014
You look terrible. Don't you sleep?

26:08.258 --> 26:12.786
I had a dream last night so boring it woke
me up. I was afraid to go back to sleep.

26:12.996 --> 26:15.123
- Where the hell have you been?
- I've been around.

26:15.332 --> 26:17.027
I've barely seen you for a month.

26:17.267 --> 26:21.067
Wait a minute, some new quiff, isn't it?
What's wrong with me?

26:21.305 --> 26:23.171
You've never been shy about this before.

26:23.408 --> 26:26.900
- Oscar.
- Weren't at the Y last week. We lost.

26:27.111 --> 26:29.375
He's getting discreet.
I can't believe it.

26:29.947 --> 26:31.812
What you got in pie today, Stella?

26:32.050 --> 26:34.985
There's cherry, cherry and cherry.

26:35.320 --> 26:37.288
- What do you recommend?
- I like the cherry.

26:37.522 --> 26:40.116
Bring it on.
And a gigantic Coca-Cola.

26:40.358 --> 26:44.317
I'm really disappointed in you. I've been
living vicariously off of you for years.

26:44.562 --> 26:48.293
- If you shut up now, I only have my wife.
- Nothing to tell, I lead a lonely life.

26:48.599 --> 26:52.035
- Right, and it'll snow later on today.
- And people are basically decent.

26:52.270 --> 26:54.363
Probably somebody I know,
somebody in uniform.

26:54.572 --> 26:57.632
- Come on.
- No army personnel around. Waitress?

26:59.143 --> 27:00.736
Could it be?

27:03.415 --> 27:04.746
Oh, I know, I know.

27:04.983 --> 27:09.079
You finally got to Glenda. How was it?
Did she let you into the no parking zone?

27:09.388 --> 27:11.515
I happen to know Glenda
is seriously involved...

27:11.724 --> 27:13.851
...with a narc from Palm Beach.
- There you are.

27:14.059 --> 27:17.028
- From Palm Beach, what is that, his hobby?
- How's the cop business?

27:17.229 --> 27:19.891
Real good. Always starts hopping
in weather like this.

27:20.132 --> 27:23.033
- When it's hot, people try to kill each other.
- That's right.

27:23.268 --> 27:26.669
I know some people who'll be dead
if we don't get a break soon.

27:26.939 --> 27:29.601
We got more of everything bad
since the wave started.

27:30.275 --> 27:32.209
It's that crisis atmosphere.

27:32.444 --> 27:34.969
People dress different, feel different,
they sweat more...

27:35.180 --> 27:38.275
...wake up cranky and never recover.
Look at Lowenstein.

27:39.285 --> 27:41.412
Everything is just a little askew.

27:42.222 --> 27:45.419
Pretty soon people think
the old rules are not in effect...

27:45.658 --> 27:49.116
...start to break them, figuring nobody'll
care because it's emergency time.

27:49.562 --> 27:50.551
Time out.

27:50.797 --> 27:54.597
I can't figure out how you can be doing
advanced theoretical thinking like that...

27:54.801 --> 27:59.170
...and still be stuck in our little town.
- Lowenstein dreams of bigger things.

27:59.773 --> 28:02.207
Assistant county prosecutor
isn't the end of the line.

28:02.409 --> 28:04.377
Someday, deputy county prosecutor.

28:04.611 --> 28:07.910
When the truth comes out about some
of the dirt I've been involved in...

28:08.114 --> 28:10.241
...my future in this state
will be unlimited.

28:10.450 --> 28:11.781
Hi, Ned.

28:13.853 --> 28:15.253
Hi, Glenda.

29:01.102 --> 29:04.094
- You all right?
- Don't stop.

29:06.908 --> 29:09.103
You are killing me.
I'm red, I'm sore.

29:09.344 --> 29:11.107
You're sore?
You've got nerve.

29:11.346 --> 29:13.177
Look at it.
It's about to fall off.

29:13.415 --> 29:16.179
Is there any more ice?
I'm burning up.

29:29.865 --> 29:31.993
He's coming up tomorrow.

29:33.402 --> 29:35.836
I can't stand the thought of him.

29:36.472 --> 29:38.099
He's small...

29:38.341 --> 29:39.638
...and mean...

29:39.876 --> 29:41.400
...and weak.

30:55.853 --> 30:57.184
Lady, you want to fuck?

31:01.593 --> 31:02.753
Gee, I don't know.

31:04.128 --> 31:05.288
Maybe.

31:07.699 --> 31:10.998
- This sure is a friendly town.
- I'm sorry.

31:11.235 --> 31:12.634
You are?

31:12.870 --> 31:15.031
You mean the offer is no good?

31:16.074 --> 31:17.371
I feel like a jerk.

31:18.109 --> 31:21.078
Well, maybe you were supposed
to deliver it next door.

31:21.779 --> 31:25.113
You must be looking for
the lady of the house.

31:25.351 --> 31:26.943
Ned, this is Mary Ann.

31:27.186 --> 31:31.020
We were just meeting.
Ned made me feel very welcome.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.881
I am an idiot.

31:35.427 --> 31:36.724
How are you? I'm...

31:37.262 --> 31:40.595
- You staying in town?
- No, just passing through.

31:41.100 --> 31:43.534
Nice area.
A little hot for my tastes.

31:43.736 --> 31:46.899
It's unusual.
We're famous for our cool breezes.

31:47.339 --> 31:48.829
Want to stay for dinner?

31:49.174 --> 31:50.801
I've got to go.

31:51.143 --> 31:52.701
Got to go.

31:53.278 --> 31:54.540
Bye.

31:55.681 --> 31:57.478
You two have fun now.

32:04.190 --> 32:06.454
I didn't see her car.

32:09.329 --> 32:12.662
I'm sorry.
I've got to be more careful.

32:12.966 --> 32:14.957
Mary Ann is an old friend.

32:15.535 --> 32:17.526
She's like a sister to me.

32:17.771 --> 32:19.966
She wants me to be happy.

32:29.916 --> 32:31.474
How do you know?

32:31.718 --> 32:33.049
I saw the will once.

32:33.286 --> 32:35.015
He showed it to me.

32:35.288 --> 32:38.314
He was trying to prove something.
How much he loved me, or something.

32:38.525 --> 32:40.391
How did he get so fat?

32:40.628 --> 32:43.756
Stock market,
real estate, investments.

32:44.131 --> 32:46.725
He doesn't tell me much,
but I've picked up a little.

32:46.967 --> 32:49.993
- They own a lot of land along the shore.
- Who's "they"?

32:50.438 --> 32:54.238
He's never introduced me to anyone.
I'm not sure if they're all legitimate.

32:55.443 --> 32:58.105
I wonder what they call themselves.
Maybe I've heard of them.

32:58.345 --> 33:01.803
I know they own that place
in Miranda Beach, The Breakers.

33:02.316 --> 33:05.376
The Breakers? I thought
Morrie Fisher owned that land.

33:05.619 --> 33:07.382
Edmund mentioned it once.

33:08.255 --> 33:10.655
It scares me to talk about these things.

33:10.925 --> 33:11.892
Why?

33:12.126 --> 33:14.151
- You know.
- No, I don't.

33:14.462 --> 33:17.488
Let's just not.
Let's just not think about all he's got.

33:17.732 --> 33:19.223
Wait a minute.

33:20.669 --> 33:23.160
Tell me exactly what it is
that frightens you.

33:25.107 --> 33:27.075
I'm afraid because...

33:28.376 --> 33:30.207
...when I think about it...

33:30.512 --> 33:32.343
...I wish he'd die.

33:33.181 --> 33:37.447
That's really what I want.
It's horrible and it's ugly...

33:37.819 --> 33:39.753
...and it's what I most want.

33:41.957 --> 33:44.619
- That's where we're at, isn't it?
- What do you mean?

33:44.860 --> 33:49.297
That's what we're both thinking. How good
it would be for us if he was gone.

33:49.531 --> 33:51.897
No, Ned. Please, don't.
Don't talk about it.

33:52.100 --> 33:54.568
Talk is dangerous,
sometimes it makes things happen.

33:54.770 --> 33:56.671
- It makes them real.
- Don't get scared.

33:56.906 --> 33:58.999
Because he is not going to die.

33:59.242 --> 34:02.700
Nothing wrong with him, is there?
No reason to think he'll die, is there?

34:02.912 --> 34:04.140
- No.
- That's right.

34:04.347 --> 34:06.440
So we might as well forget about it.

34:06.916 --> 34:10.010
It's not going to just happen
to make things nice for us.

34:11.286 --> 34:13.221
It won't just happen.

34:41.118 --> 34:43.143
If you do leave him,
you'll come out all right.

34:43.387 --> 34:45.617
- A divorce?
- Yeah, he's ripe.

34:45.856 --> 34:48.848
No, I signed a prenuptial agreement.

34:49.960 --> 34:52.428
- What?
- He insisted.

34:52.663 --> 34:54.391
He blamed it on his sister, Roz.

34:54.598 --> 34:57.465
She's always hated me,
but I know he wanted it too.

34:57.668 --> 35:00.159
- How is it?
- It's bad.

35:00.604 --> 35:03.801
I get some money for a year,
not much. That's it.

35:06.510 --> 35:10.571
Does it matter, Ned?
Tell me the truth, please.

35:11.816 --> 35:16.378
The truth.
I wish you were going to be loaded.

35:19.057 --> 35:22.254
Does it matter? No. No.

35:28.366 --> 35:30.732
God, you make me happy.

35:35.039 --> 35:37.030
It's time for your present.

35:46.417 --> 35:50.582
From now on, when it starts coming down
on you, I'll be there to protect you.

35:57.329 --> 35:59.923
Try it on.
I bet I guessed the size right.

36:06.438 --> 36:07.700
I love it.

36:08.340 --> 36:10.535
- I want to see.
- Here.

36:33.600 --> 36:35.192
Hello, sweetheart.

36:35.435 --> 36:37.699
Have I got a nice present for you.

36:38.939 --> 36:40.736
Hi, Aunt Matty.

36:41.641 --> 36:43.233
Heather.

36:44.511 --> 36:47.173
- What is it again?
- Rover.

36:47.380 --> 36:50.577
- It's between first and second.
- That's not a shortstop?

36:50.817 --> 36:53.547
No. The shortstop is between
second and third.

36:53.787 --> 36:55.618
Good, that's the way I remember it.

36:56.089 --> 36:57.750
Have a good time.

36:59.492 --> 37:01.255
You don't really mind, do you?

37:01.494 --> 37:03.553
Roz will pick her up Thursday.

37:03.763 --> 37:06.232
Don't worry,
Roz won't stay overnight.

37:07.034 --> 37:09.002
She can do whatever she wants.

37:49.945 --> 37:52.709
Oh, my God. You scared me.

37:54.750 --> 37:57.048
You shouldn't be here.
Heather's upstairs.

37:57.285 --> 37:59.116
Asleep.
And I know what I want.

37:59.354 --> 38:03.552
I know. I know, I missed you so badly,
but it's too dangerous.

38:03.892 --> 38:06.053
- She won't wake up now.
- You're so wet.

38:06.294 --> 38:08.387
I'd been waiting out there for two hours.

38:08.897 --> 38:10.455
So salty.

38:13.235 --> 38:14.463
Let me.

38:16.938 --> 38:18.303
Lie back.

38:18.607 --> 38:19.869
Aunt Matty?

38:28.885 --> 38:29.977
What do you say?

38:30.219 --> 38:32.244
- I did.
- She did.

38:32.488 --> 38:34.456
Thank you, Aunt Matty.

38:34.757 --> 38:38.887
- Thanks, Matty. We appreciate it.
- A pleasure, Roz. Any time.

39:12.229 --> 39:14.697
- Hi, Ned.
- It's just me tonight, Filomena.

39:14.898 --> 39:16.593
Okay. Just one minute, all right?

39:19.336 --> 39:20.667
Well, hello to you.

39:21.605 --> 39:26.668
Hello. Darling, this is Mr. Racine.
I'm sorry, I don't know your first name.

39:28.145 --> 39:30.238
Ned.

39:30.481 --> 39:32.711
Edmund Walker.
Nice to meet you.

39:33.183 --> 39:35.344
Mr. Racine is the lawyer
I told you about.

39:35.586 --> 39:38.954
You remember, darling, he had a client
who wanted to buy the house.

39:39.190 --> 39:41.055
- I told him we weren't selling.
- Right.

39:41.292 --> 39:43.123
That hasn't changed, has it?

39:43.661 --> 39:45.322
No, we're very happy with it.

39:46.164 --> 39:48.632
I can understand that.
It's a terrific place.

39:49.767 --> 39:52.930
- Are you going in?
- I was gonna grab a bite, yeah.

39:53.838 --> 39:55.203
Well, join us.

39:55.440 --> 39:58.807
- No. Thanks, I don't want to interfere.
- No, don't be silly.

39:59.043 --> 40:00.908
We have room for three, don't we?

40:01.146 --> 40:04.343
I've heard this place is great.
But you can't get near it on weekends.

40:04.549 --> 40:07.643
- I don't get down during the week much.
- Is that right?

40:09.854 --> 40:13.119
I was a lawyer.
I still am, I guess, but I don't practice.

40:13.358 --> 40:16.328
- I went to Columbia. You?
- F.S.U.

40:16.562 --> 40:20.396
A good school.
I got bored with it quick.

40:20.633 --> 40:25.400
I guess I didn't have the temperament for it.
I wanted to make the money faster.

40:25.671 --> 40:30.802
- Is there a living in it here?
- I can afford to send out my shirts...

40:31.110 --> 40:34.978
...and eat here once a month
if I don't order an appetizer.

40:36.215 --> 40:39.651
Yeah. Yeah, I figured that honest lawyers
didn't make very much...

40:39.852 --> 40:42.082
...and the other kind are too slimy for me.

40:42.321 --> 40:44.789
I'd rather be up-front
about shafting somebody.

40:44.990 --> 40:46.116
Edmund, really...

40:46.325 --> 40:48.816
...it's Mr. Racine's profession.
- No, that's all right.

40:49.061 --> 40:50.460
I don't like it much.

40:50.696 --> 40:52.631
Call me Ned, will you?

40:53.567 --> 40:56.001
What's to like?
That's the way of the world.

40:56.203 --> 40:58.535
Most people despise their jobs.

40:58.838 --> 41:01.568
- Do you?
- No.

41:02.342 --> 41:03.570
No, I love it.

41:04.377 --> 41:06.140
But it's not a job.

41:06.479 --> 41:08.572
What is it exactly?

41:11.051 --> 41:13.781
Well, various things.
This and that.

41:13.987 --> 41:16.649
- Here and there.
- You don't have to be specific.

41:19.392 --> 41:22.953
Finance, basically.
Venture capital, real estate...

41:23.163 --> 41:25.631
...investments.
We're into a few things.

41:25.832 --> 41:27.322
- Around here?
- Some.

41:27.734 --> 41:31.136
- We own some things here.
- Edmund's company owns The Breakers.

41:32.106 --> 41:35.132
- Really?
- It's not that simple, really.

41:35.376 --> 41:38.140
We have an interest
in a few places along the shore.

41:38.379 --> 41:43.180
For the land, you know, someday.
Don't try and explain that to her.

41:44.018 --> 41:46.714
I'm too dumb.
A woman, you know.

41:47.622 --> 41:50.489
Well, I'll be right back.

41:51.058 --> 41:55.688
Then maybe we can talk about
pantyhose or something interesting.

42:02.470 --> 42:04.165
She's something, isn't she?

42:04.405 --> 42:08.172
- She is a lovely lady.
- Yes, she is.

42:08.410 --> 42:10.378
And I'm crazy about her.

42:11.613 --> 42:13.604
If I thought she was seeing
another guy...

42:13.815 --> 42:15.476
I don't know.

42:16.018 --> 42:19.181
I could understand how it could happen,
her being the way she is.

42:19.421 --> 42:20.888
I could understand it...

42:21.990 --> 42:25.187
...but I think I'd kill the guy
with my bare hands.

42:25.761 --> 42:27.558
That's understanding.

42:31.733 --> 42:32.722
Please.

42:33.435 --> 42:36.893
You'd never believe the dorkus
she was with when I met her.

42:37.639 --> 42:40.767
The guy came to us
with a business proposition.

42:41.810 --> 42:43.971
We're always looking for opportunities.

42:44.513 --> 42:46.573
We're willing to take
an occasional risk...

42:46.816 --> 42:49.876
...if the downside isn't too steep,
if the conditions are right.

42:50.119 --> 42:53.418
But this guy,
he hadn't done his homework.

42:53.656 --> 42:57.592
He didn't know the bottom line.
That's how I knew he was full of shit.

42:57.827 --> 43:01.194
Got to know the bottom line.
That's all that counts.

43:01.464 --> 43:03.728
But he didn't have the goods, this guy.

43:05.101 --> 43:06.864
He's like lots of guys you run into.

43:07.103 --> 43:09.128
They wanna get rich.
They wanna do it quick.

43:09.339 --> 43:11.239
They wanna be there with one score.

43:11.441 --> 43:15.571
But they're not willing to do what's
necessary. You know what I mean?

43:15.812 --> 43:19.509
I'm not sure. You mean
do the groundwork? Earn it?

43:19.716 --> 43:23.619
No. No, I mean do what's necessary.

43:24.288 --> 43:26.381
Whatever is necessary.

43:28.525 --> 43:29.958
Yeah...

43:30.427 --> 43:34.955
...I know that kind of guy.
I hate that. It makes me sick.

43:36.300 --> 43:39.497
- Me too.
- I'm a lot like that.

44:14.973 --> 44:18.067
Some messages are on your desk.
I'll be back in an hour.

44:40.800 --> 44:42.267
Jesus. Did Beverly see you?

44:43.135 --> 44:44.830
I waited until I saw her leave.

44:45.971 --> 44:47.666
Please, don't be angry.

44:49.175 --> 44:51.507
Angry? I'm not angry.
How did you get in?

44:51.744 --> 44:53.211
It didn't lock.

44:54.780 --> 44:56.304
Ned, hold me.

44:57.483 --> 44:59.212
Please.

44:59.418 --> 45:01.010
Just hold me.

45:02.721 --> 45:04.552
God, I love you.

45:06.659 --> 45:08.149
He left this morning.

45:08.394 --> 45:10.862
- I had to see you.
- I know.

45:15.734 --> 45:16.928
I couldn't call.

45:17.169 --> 45:20.037
I was afraid to. I was afraid
you wouldn't let me come.

45:20.273 --> 45:22.104
That's right, you mustn't call.
Never call.

45:22.342 --> 45:24.810
Be very careful.
The phone company keeps records.

45:25.145 --> 45:26.806
I am careful.

45:27.180 --> 45:28.442
Ned, I hated it.

45:28.682 --> 45:31.776
I hated sitting there with the two of you.
I thought I'd scream.

45:32.018 --> 45:33.883
You called my apartment from the house.

45:34.120 --> 45:35.781
- No, never.
- Those two times?

45:36.022 --> 45:37.683
I went to phone booths.

45:37.924 --> 45:39.551
I'm afraid of him, Ned.

45:39.759 --> 45:43.092
That's good. You have to be
very careful now about the phones.

45:43.296 --> 45:46.163
- Why do you say this now?
- We can account for a couple of calls.

45:46.399 --> 45:50.529
- We've had some contact. It'd make sense.
- Why, Ned? What's happened?

45:53.373 --> 45:55.535
Because we're going to kill him.

45:58.179 --> 46:00.443
We both know that.

46:02.617 --> 46:04.448
It's what you want, isn't it?

46:05.653 --> 46:07.450
We knew it was coming.

46:07.722 --> 46:10.282
It's the only way we can
have everything we want, isn't it?

46:26.974 --> 46:29.101
That man is going to die...

46:30.177 --> 46:33.944
...for no reason but we want him dead.

46:36.518 --> 46:39.180
He doesn't deserve it.
Let's not ever say that.

46:40.489 --> 46:43.686
We'll do it for us, and you'll inherit half
of everything he owns.

46:43.892 --> 46:46.053
That's what the will says, right?

46:49.064 --> 46:50.861
That's it, then.

46:51.066 --> 46:52.761
That's it, then.

46:54.836 --> 46:59.034
We're going to kill him,
and I think I know how.

46:59.274 --> 47:01.765
- It's real, then?
- It's real, all right.

47:06.348 --> 47:09.784
And if we're not careful,
it'll be the last real thing we do.

48:31.336 --> 48:35.067
Her mother works plenty hard
to keep Heather on Edmund's mind.

48:35.306 --> 48:39.743
Always bringing her around,
reporting on everything she does in school.

48:40.178 --> 48:42.203
That Roz is a smart one.

48:42.514 --> 48:44.744
And anything Heather inherits
goes straight to Roz.

48:44.949 --> 48:46.576
Heather won't even get a look at it.

48:46.785 --> 48:49.515
That's the part I can't stand.
That's what seems so wrong...

48:49.721 --> 48:53.748
...that half of it should go to her.
- There's nothing we can do about it.

48:53.992 --> 48:55.482
Are you sure?

48:55.860 --> 48:59.159
I was thinking that maybe there is.

48:59.397 --> 49:03.094
The will is with Edmund's lawyer
in Miami. I know that.

49:04.603 --> 49:06.730
What if I can get him to bring it home?

49:07.206 --> 49:10.642
Then couldn't we rewrite it?
Change it?

49:11.711 --> 49:14.578
Every little change
would mean a lot for us.

49:15.481 --> 49:17.676
And you're a lawyer,
you know how to write it.

49:18.017 --> 49:19.644
It wouldn't seem so odd.

49:19.852 --> 49:22.446
I could say he brought it home,
and we talked about it...

49:22.655 --> 49:24.646
...and decided to make
some changes up here.

49:24.857 --> 49:28.452
- And I knew you already...
- No. Forget it.

49:28.661 --> 49:32.119
- I don't see why Heather should take half?
- Listen to me, Matty...

49:32.331 --> 49:34.959
...nothing strange can happen
in his life right now.

49:35.201 --> 49:38.102
Not one thing out of the ordinary.

49:38.304 --> 49:40.499
That's vital.
That's the most important thing.

49:40.740 --> 49:43.801
If it does,
the chances double that we get caught.

49:44.878 --> 49:46.311
You'll get half of everything.

49:46.513 --> 49:51.075
It'll be plenty. No matter what it is,
we'll be satisfied. We won't get greedy.

49:53.420 --> 49:55.581
If we do, we'll get burned.

49:58.592 --> 50:00.116
You're right, darling.

50:01.661 --> 50:03.720
I'm sorry.
I know you're right.

50:20.581 --> 50:23.209
I know where he is.
It's not far from here.

50:25.286 --> 50:28.346
- I don't want you with me.
- I thought we settled that.

50:28.589 --> 50:29.988
I'll wait in the car...

50:30.224 --> 50:33.955
...but I want to take the risk with you.
We're both doing this.

51:02.291 --> 51:04.782
What's the matter,
you can't think with a little music?

51:05.527 --> 51:06.892
It's like this, I said.

51:07.095 --> 51:09.825
- It's fast, it's hot, it's simple.
- That's it?

51:10.499 --> 51:13.491
Yeah, you can use the clock,
or rig it to something that moves.

51:13.735 --> 51:16.602
It starts big.
It will go with just the mag chips.

51:17.005 --> 51:20.065
You want a little more,
splash a little accelerator around.

51:21.009 --> 51:22.636
Is it just regular gasoline?

51:22.878 --> 51:26.439
Yeah, regular, unleaded, supreme,
whatever you like, counselor.

51:28.016 --> 51:30.746
I got to tell you,
this mama has got a big drawback to it.

51:30.953 --> 51:33.251
- What?
- It's easy to spot.

51:33.956 --> 51:36.858
Even after the meltdown,
they're going to know it's arson.

51:37.093 --> 51:40.893
I don't care about that.
That's all there is to it?

51:42.632 --> 51:46.500
No, that ain't all there is to it.
You gotta get in, you gotta get out.

51:47.136 --> 51:50.936
You gotta pick the right spot,
the right time...

51:52.308 --> 51:55.505
...and you gotta try not to get famous
while you're in the act.

51:55.712 --> 51:58.180
If that's all there was to it,
any idiot could do it.

51:58.414 --> 52:01.577
- I'm sorry.
- I want to ask you something.

52:02.318 --> 52:04.149
Are you listening to me, asshole?

52:04.387 --> 52:07.584
Because I like you.
I got a serious question for you.

52:08.358 --> 52:12.055
What the fuck are you doing?
This is not shit for you to be messing with.

52:13.396 --> 52:17.458
You ready to hear something? I want you
to see if this sounds familiar.

52:18.202 --> 52:22.639
Any time you try a decent crime,
you've got 50 ways you can fuck up.

52:22.873 --> 52:27.367
If you think of 25 of them, then you're
a genius. And you ain't no genius.

52:28.379 --> 52:30.244
Remember who told me that?

52:32.449 --> 52:34.747
Hey, no smoking in here.

52:35.185 --> 52:39.121
Look, why don't you let me
do it for you? Gratis. I'll do it.

52:40.024 --> 52:43.187
I wouldn't even be on the street
if it weren't for you.

52:43.527 --> 52:44.892
Thanks.

52:46.096 --> 52:48.121
I sure hope you know what you're doing.

52:48.432 --> 52:51.596
You better be damn sure,
because if you ain't sure, then don't do it.

52:52.604 --> 52:54.936
Of course,
that's my recommendation, anyway.

52:55.173 --> 52:56.663
Don't do it.

52:56.908 --> 53:01.072
Because I'll tell you something, counselor.
This arson is serious crime.

53:16.528 --> 53:17.756
And?

53:18.263 --> 53:20.959
- You'll be downstairs.
- And?

53:21.566 --> 53:24.160
Two thirty, I send him down.

53:27.906 --> 53:30.637
We won't talk again
after I leave here tonight.

53:32.912 --> 53:36.404
I'll be in Miami by noon Friday.
You won't be able to reach me.

53:41.387 --> 53:43.855
When I see you again,
he'll be dead.

53:48.361 --> 53:49.828
I'm frightened.

55:21.422 --> 55:23.550
Jesus, take it easy.

55:23.792 --> 55:26.192
- I thought I was tense.
- Where are you going?

55:26.395 --> 55:28.659
I can't sleep.
I'm going to get something to drink.

55:28.864 --> 55:30.161
Edmund.

55:33.202 --> 55:35.193
I can't sleep, either.

55:38.207 --> 55:40.004
Come back to bed, darling.

55:58.260 --> 56:00.991
No, don't stop.

56:02.799 --> 56:04.562
You trying to kill me?

56:26.523 --> 56:27.888
What's wrong?

56:28.825 --> 56:31.988
I think someone's downstairs.
I heard something.

56:32.228 --> 56:33.718
Are you sure?

56:35.698 --> 56:37.063
Want me to call the police?

56:37.300 --> 56:39.792
Will you be quiet.
I'm going to nail this bastard.

56:40.037 --> 56:42.005
- Edmund, what's that?
- Would you be quiet.

56:42.206 --> 56:45.198
- I've never seen that.
- I've got a surprise for this fucker.

57:52.677 --> 57:54.339
- He has a gun!
- Where?

58:46.910 --> 58:50.243
The car's at the end of the drive.
Spend 15 minutes cleaning up, then come.

58:50.447 --> 58:52.915
You have to be careful
driving in this fog.

58:53.950 --> 58:55.577
Are you all right?

58:57.487 --> 58:59.079
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:01:11.625 --> 01:01:13.456
Thank God. I thought...

01:01:27.374 --> 01:01:29.638
They're right on time,
and I'm running late.

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:54.493
We won't talk for a long time.

01:02:58.068 --> 01:03:00.195
Mr. Racine's office.

01:03:01.538 --> 01:03:03.130
Just a moment, please.

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:07.266
Ned, Miles Hardin.
Do you want him?

01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:10.911
- Who is he?
- She says he's a lawyer from Miami.

01:03:12.148 --> 01:03:13.615
Hello.

01:03:14.017 --> 01:03:16.281
<i>- Mr. Racine?</i>
- Yes.

01:03:16.486 --> 01:03:19.887
<i>Miles Hardin of</i>
<i>Morris and Dale in Miami.</i>

01:03:20.423 --> 01:03:24.325
<i>As you know,</i>
<i>we represented Edmund Walker.</i>

01:03:28.331 --> 01:03:29.662
Yes?

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:32.165
<i>Yes...</i>

01:03:32.369 --> 01:03:37.467
<i>... well, Mrs. Walker has submitted</i>
<i>the new will you wrote up there.</i>

01:03:41.712 --> 01:03:43.179
I see.

01:03:44.849 --> 01:03:48.785
<i>And frankly, Mr. Racine,</i>
<i>I think we may have a problem.</i>

01:03:50.321 --> 01:03:51.948
What problem is that?

01:03:52.189 --> 01:03:54.453
<i>I'd rather discuss it in person.</i>

01:03:54.692 --> 01:03:58.128
<i>In fact, I think it might be best</i>
<i>if we could all get together up there.</i>

01:03:58.362 --> 01:04:00.830
<i>That is, if you wouldn't object.</i>

01:04:01.766 --> 01:04:03.825
No. No, that would be all right.

01:04:04.135 --> 01:04:08.834
<i>Good. We have a relationship with a</i>
<i>firm in West Palm, Shiller-Hastings.</i>

01:04:09.073 --> 01:04:10.631
Yes, I know them.

01:04:11.242 --> 01:04:13.643
<i>I've arranged to have the use</i>
<i>of their offices.</i>

01:04:13.879 --> 01:04:17.246
<i>I thought we might try to make it tomorrow,</i>
<i>say 10:00.</i>

01:04:17.482 --> 01:04:19.473
<i>Would that be possible for you?</i>

01:04:20.986 --> 01:04:23.079
- Yes, I think so.
<i>- Good.</i>

01:04:23.321 --> 01:04:26.188
<i>Mrs. Walker told me</i>
<i>she'd be back up there by then...</i>

01:04:26.425 --> 01:04:30.919
<i>... and I've asked Mrs. Kraft,</i>
<i>Mr. Walker's sister, to join us also.</i>

01:04:31.763 --> 01:04:34.197
<i>- I'll see you then.</i>
- Right.

01:04:34.433 --> 01:04:36.924
<i>- Goodbye.</i>
- Bye.

01:04:44.009 --> 01:04:45.499
I don't have her. Should I?

01:04:46.645 --> 01:04:50.776
I thought the temporary put her in.
She came in while you were on vacation.

01:04:50.983 --> 01:04:53.850
Look her up.
They were in Pinehaven, I think.

01:05:03.329 --> 01:05:05.160
<i>Get no answer at the Pinehaven number.</i>

01:05:08.134 --> 01:05:09.829
Okay, try again later.

01:05:19.479 --> 01:05:22.141
- Miles Hardin, Mr. Racine.
- How are you?

01:05:22.381 --> 01:05:24.781
I don't think you know Mrs. Kraft.

01:05:26.619 --> 01:05:28.086
No, I don't.

01:05:29.690 --> 01:05:31.123
My condolences.

01:05:31.358 --> 01:05:32.586
Thank you.

01:05:38.599 --> 01:05:41.693
Mrs. Walker, I am very sorry
about your husband.

01:05:41.935 --> 01:05:43.300
Thank you, Mr. Racine.

01:05:43.504 --> 01:05:45.028
You know Mr. Lowenstein.

01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:48.335
- Hello, Peter.
- Hi, Ned.

01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:56.014
I've asked Mr. Lowenstein
to join us...

01:05:56.216 --> 01:05:58.377
...because he's handling the inquiry...

01:05:58.619 --> 01:06:02.316
...into Edmund Walker's death
for the county prosecutor's office.

01:06:02.623 --> 01:06:04.420
He and I have discussed this matter...

01:06:04.625 --> 01:06:07.857
...and he's made it possible
for us to speak very frankly here today...

01:06:08.062 --> 01:06:09.996
...off the record, so to speak.

01:06:11.032 --> 01:06:15.093
As I've told Mrs. Walker, I was more than
surprised at the existence of this new will.

01:06:15.336 --> 01:06:18.169
Edmund hadn't mentioned
anything about it to me.

01:06:18.907 --> 01:06:20.238
Mrs. Walker explained to me...

01:06:20.441 --> 01:06:23.069
...when she and her husband decided
to make a few changes...

01:06:23.278 --> 01:06:26.372
...they took care of it up here
for simplicity's sake.

01:06:26.581 --> 01:06:29.607
Indeed, as you know, the new will
is almost identical to the old...

01:06:29.851 --> 01:06:32.183
...but for the disposition
of a few items.

01:06:32.387 --> 01:06:34.753
At the risk of oversimplifying,
the thrust...

01:06:34.956 --> 01:06:37.948
...of the will is to divide the estate
in almost equal parts...

01:06:38.193 --> 01:06:40.787
...between Heather Kraft
and Mrs. Walker.

01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:43.463
Would you agree
with that assessment, Mr. Racine?

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:50.932
Yes, well, you witnessed
Edmund Walker's signature along with...

01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:53.938
...this Miss Mary Ann Simpson.

01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:57.868
Apparently, it will be impossible for us
to contact Miss Simpson.

01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:00.446
Mary Ann is a lifelong friend of mine.

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:04.547
She was visiting on her way to Europe.
She'll be in touch on her return.

01:07:04.787 --> 01:07:06.584
Although, it's really not required.

01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:09.314
Witnesses of a will's signing
are often unavailable...

01:07:09.558 --> 01:07:12.959
...when the will is entered into probate.
It's not standard by any means.

01:07:13.195 --> 01:07:15.993
Edmund Walker's death was not standard.

01:07:17.099 --> 01:07:21.229
I'm confused. Is there some question
as to the authenticity of the will?

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:23.098
I'm confused too.

01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:28.004
You have a problem with the witnessing
or the signatures? What are you getting at?

01:07:28.211 --> 01:07:31.874
No, I'm afraid the problem lies elsewhere.

01:07:33.817 --> 01:07:36.308
Would anybody mind if I smoked?

01:07:50.133 --> 01:07:53.068
No, I don't need my own.
I'll just breathe the air.

01:08:01.579 --> 01:08:03.274
Everything's in order up to there.

01:08:03.514 --> 01:08:06.677
The problem comes in the language
of the bequest to Heather.

01:08:06.918 --> 01:08:08.818
It's a technical matter.

01:08:09.086 --> 01:08:12.419
In writing the will, I'm afraid
Mr. Racine violated what's known as...

01:08:12.657 --> 01:08:14.955
..."the rule against perpetuities."

01:08:15.293 --> 01:08:19.627
It forbids an inheritance to be
passed down indefinitely for generations.

01:08:19.863 --> 01:08:23.663
I knew that a probate judge in Miami
would spot the mistake right away...

01:08:24.167 --> 01:08:27.228
...so I thought I'd bring it up here
to Okeelanta County...

01:08:27.438 --> 01:08:29.429
...since Edmund had the residence here...

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:33.508
...and see if I could get lucky with a judge
who didn't know estate law quite so well.

01:08:33.711 --> 01:08:37.238
Perhaps find one with the same
kind of training as Mr. Racine.

01:08:37.481 --> 01:08:40.314
Unfortunately, my plan backfired.

01:08:40.652 --> 01:08:45.055
I ran into a judge who had had
other dealings with Mr. Racine...

01:08:45.290 --> 01:08:47.053
...a Judge Costanza.

01:08:47.292 --> 01:08:50.819
It seems there were problems
with an estate in a case four years ago.

01:08:51.063 --> 01:08:52.962
Very different problems, it's true...

01:08:53.165 --> 01:08:56.760
...but on a will that Mr. Racine
prepared. It was quite a mess.

01:08:57.002 --> 01:09:01.131
Accusations of carelessness and malpractice
suit. I think he called it the Gourson case.

01:09:01.372 --> 01:09:02.805
Gourson.

01:09:04.209 --> 01:09:06.734
Once again, Mr. Hardin, you've lost me.

01:09:07.312 --> 01:09:09.542
Yes, what does this all mean?

01:09:09.781 --> 01:09:12.375
It means, I'm afraid,
that Edmund's will is invalid.

01:09:12.617 --> 01:09:16.816
Edmund Walker died intestate,
as though there were no will at all.

01:09:17.790 --> 01:09:19.724
So what happens now?

01:09:20.093 --> 01:09:21.582
You don't know?

01:09:22.595 --> 01:09:23.960
No, I don't.

01:09:24.497 --> 01:09:26.761
Perhaps Mr. Racine
would like to tell you.

01:09:30.103 --> 01:09:32.867
In the state of Florida,
when a person dies without a will...

01:09:33.106 --> 01:09:35.666
...and there are no children
or surviving parents...

01:09:39.444 --> 01:09:41.935
...then the spouse inherits everything.

01:09:44.951 --> 01:09:46.475
My God.

01:09:47.987 --> 01:09:50.113
You mean it's all mine?

01:09:50.656 --> 01:09:53.318
Though that was clearly
not your husband's intention.

01:09:54.028 --> 01:09:55.655
My God.

01:09:56.463 --> 01:09:58.658
He intended Heather to benefit.

01:10:03.237 --> 01:10:04.431
Of course.

01:10:04.671 --> 01:10:06.400
Of course, I understand.

01:10:07.074 --> 01:10:08.564
Of course.

01:10:16.050 --> 01:10:17.847
You look good in black.

01:10:18.485 --> 01:10:22.046
I've missed you so badly.
I need you.

01:10:22.423 --> 01:10:25.881
At first, I couldn't figure out how
you got my stationery. Then it came to me.

01:10:26.093 --> 01:10:29.085
Edmund's signature was a snap.
You knew I wouldn't challenge mine.

01:10:29.296 --> 01:10:32.027
Please stop. I don't blame you
for hating me right now.

01:10:33.435 --> 01:10:37.428
You have really done it, Matty.
You really have.

01:10:39.207 --> 01:10:41.266
Will you come to the house tonight?

01:10:50.251 --> 01:10:53.015
I want you more now than I ever have.

01:10:54.355 --> 01:10:56.220
I know how you must feel...

01:10:56.458 --> 01:10:58.392
...but please come tonight.

01:10:59.861 --> 01:11:01.852
I hope you haven't done us in.

01:11:43.873 --> 01:11:45.033
Hi, guys.

01:11:46.408 --> 01:11:48.639
Just come on in.
Make yourself at home.

01:11:48.879 --> 01:11:50.141
- Sorry about that.
- Not me.

01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:54.214
The door was unlocked, inviting illegal
entry, which makes Oscar's job so hard.

01:11:54.451 --> 01:11:56.544
Sorry, Oscar.
You guys want a beer?

01:11:56.853 --> 01:11:58.377
No thank you. I already had one.

01:11:59.856 --> 01:12:03.292
Ned, how in the fuck did you ever
get involved with this Matty Walker?

01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:07.296
- What do you mean?
- I mean, she's poison.

01:12:07.797 --> 01:12:09.765
What do you know
about her old man's death?

01:12:09.966 --> 01:12:12.400
What I read. He died in the fire.
Looks like arson.

01:12:12.636 --> 01:12:13.933
Was arson.

01:12:14.237 --> 01:12:15.829
Okay, was arson.

01:12:16.072 --> 01:12:18.267
You don't know if he set it
and fucked up...

01:12:18.508 --> 01:12:20.874
...or if that's how
somebody wanted it to look like.

01:12:21.077 --> 01:12:22.942
He didn't set it.
Somebody offed him.

01:12:24.781 --> 01:12:27.876
- His people owned the place, right?
- That's right.

01:12:28.653 --> 01:12:31.087
And a very rough group of fellows too.

01:12:31.689 --> 01:12:34.783
Possible they wanted to cut Edmund out,
but it doesn't seem like...

01:12:35.026 --> 01:12:37.153
...a very neat way
to handle something like that.

01:12:37.361 --> 01:12:41.263
No, it's not their style. They're very smooth.
They'd rather destroy you than kill you.

01:12:41.499 --> 01:12:42.864
And they hate publicity.

01:12:43.067 --> 01:12:46.036
Me, I'm more interested
in the grieving widow.

01:12:46.304 --> 01:12:49.102
Her sister-in-law has got plenty
of ideas along that line too.

01:12:49.307 --> 01:12:51.104
She could barely contain herself today.

01:12:51.342 --> 01:12:52.570
I noticed that.

01:12:52.810 --> 01:12:55.779
But she wants to wait and see how
Matty treats her on the estate.

01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:58.710
- Doesn't want to blow it.
- How'd you get involved?

01:13:00.218 --> 01:13:03.916
They asked me to redo the will.
I met with her and Edmund.

01:13:04.156 --> 01:13:06.147
It was pretty simple.

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:13.129
Mary Ann Simpson witnessed it with me.
Walker didn't think it was a big deal.

01:13:13.365 --> 01:13:15.856
- That's it?
- That's it.

01:13:16.235 --> 01:13:18.362
- What was this Simpson's story?
- I don't know.

01:13:18.570 --> 01:13:22.028
She was just passing through. Old friend
of the family's. Good-looking broad.

01:13:22.274 --> 01:13:23.673
On her way to Europe?

01:13:26.278 --> 01:13:28.712
The passport people
didn't have any record of it.

01:13:30.649 --> 01:13:32.310
What do you think?

01:13:33.552 --> 01:13:35.076
About the wife.

01:13:37.589 --> 01:13:42.391
I suppose it's possible. I don't know much
about her except what I've seen.

01:13:43.563 --> 01:13:47.192
- It wouldn't shock me either way.
- I have this feeling she's very bad news.

01:13:47.433 --> 01:13:50.596
Take some incredibly intelligent advice
and stay away from her.

01:13:50.803 --> 01:13:52.794
He's right, for once.

01:13:57.377 --> 01:14:00.141
Well, I'm sorry, guys.

01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:02.211
I just can't do that.

01:14:02.715 --> 01:14:03.704
Why not?

01:14:05.251 --> 01:14:07.913
For one thing,
did you get a look at her?

01:14:08.988 --> 01:14:12.321
That wouldn't be quite so meaningful,
except today she came on to me...

01:14:12.558 --> 01:14:15.391
...and that lady is about to come into
a great deal of money.

01:14:15.595 --> 01:14:19.589
In fact, she invited me out there tonight
and I'm going, and I'll keep on going...

01:14:19.833 --> 01:14:22.461
...as many days or nights...

01:14:22.703 --> 01:14:25.171
...or weekends as she'll have me.

01:14:25.773 --> 01:14:30.540
Ned, someday your dick is going to
lead you into a very big hassle.

01:14:30.978 --> 01:14:32.809
That lady may have killed her husband.

01:14:33.013 --> 01:14:35.447
Yeah, but she won't inherit anything
by killing me.

01:14:36.116 --> 01:14:38.880
Besides, maybe she'll try
to fuck me to death.

01:14:47.328 --> 01:14:50.388
Ned, you've messed up before and
you will again. It's your nature.

01:14:50.631 --> 01:14:55.125
But they've always been small-time.
This might not be.

01:14:55.336 --> 01:14:58.898
She's trouble, Ned, the real thing.
Big-time, major-league trouble.

01:14:59.941 --> 01:15:01.408
Watch yourself.

01:15:10.118 --> 01:15:13.178
Mary Ann and I left Wheaton together
and went to Chicago.

01:15:13.621 --> 01:15:15.145
We didn't know what we were doing.

01:15:16.191 --> 01:15:19.354
I got into bad trouble with drugs.
Speed.

01:15:19.761 --> 01:15:21.228
Real bad.

01:15:21.763 --> 01:15:23.321
I did things that...

01:15:25.667 --> 01:15:27.396
Worse than you can imagine.

01:15:27.669 --> 01:15:30.797
I thought I would die.
I prayed I would.

01:15:33.174 --> 01:15:35.040
And then a man helped me.

01:15:35.277 --> 01:15:36.904
He got me clean.

01:15:37.146 --> 01:15:39.341
He didn't want much in return, either.

01:15:40.149 --> 01:15:44.586
He was a lawyer. He put me to work
in his office. I learned a lot there.

01:15:47.089 --> 01:15:50.217
That's where I picked up the business
about making a will invalid.

01:15:50.459 --> 01:15:52.324
It happened to him.

01:15:53.162 --> 01:15:57.462
I swear, I never would have used you
if I had known about your case.

01:15:59.802 --> 01:16:02.202
I was afraid to tell you.

01:16:03.139 --> 01:16:05.073
I knew you wouldn't let me do it.

01:16:05.307 --> 01:16:08.401
I'm greedy, like you said.
I wanted us to have it all.

01:16:11.914 --> 01:16:13.542
I don't blame you...

01:16:13.784 --> 01:16:15.945
...for thinking I'm bad.

01:16:16.686 --> 01:16:18.711
I am. I know it.

01:16:20.190 --> 01:16:22.920
I'd understand
if you cut me off right now.

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:26.352
If you never trusted me again,
you'd probably be smart...

01:16:27.631 --> 01:16:30.293
...but you must believe one thing:

01:16:31.034 --> 01:16:32.592
I love you.

01:16:33.804 --> 01:16:36.637
I love you, and I need you.

01:16:37.307 --> 01:16:39.707
And I want to be with you forever.

01:16:44.481 --> 01:16:46.642
They already think you're involved.

01:16:47.451 --> 01:16:48.850
I don't care.

01:16:51.155 --> 01:16:52.281
Great.

01:16:53.758 --> 01:16:56.556
There's nothing we can do about it now.

01:16:57.495 --> 01:17:00.191
In a little while,
we'll either have the money or we won't.

01:17:00.431 --> 01:17:02.399
It's out of our hands.

01:17:05.570 --> 01:17:07.299
I fired the housekeeper.

01:17:08.873 --> 01:17:11.398
We can stay together
as long as we want.

01:17:12.276 --> 01:17:14.107
We're all alone now.

01:17:42.508 --> 01:17:45.068
That's right, I've been
going down there a lot lately.

01:17:45.310 --> 01:17:48.609
Isn't that amazing? Miami. Jesus.

01:17:53.719 --> 01:17:56.244
I'm handling the purchases
of some property down there.

01:17:56.455 --> 01:18:01.017
I'll be going back again in the future if
that's okay, if it's still legal to go to Miami.

01:18:01.226 --> 01:18:02.955
- He's mad.
- Why should I be mad...

01:18:03.161 --> 01:18:05.061
...because my friend
I've known for years...

01:18:05.264 --> 01:18:07.529
...asks my whereabouts the night
of a recent murder?

01:18:07.734 --> 01:18:10.396
It's not so recent anymore.
Maybe he feels a bit of pressure.

01:18:10.637 --> 01:18:12.127
You brought this on yourself, man.

01:18:12.372 --> 01:18:15.398
I don't run this department.
There are people watching this thing.

01:18:15.642 --> 01:18:18.167
They hear you out there every night
banging the widow...

01:18:18.378 --> 01:18:20.278
...it tends to call attention to you.

01:18:20.513 --> 01:18:22.413
So don't give me that shit.

01:18:22.649 --> 01:18:24.173
That is my business.

01:18:24.417 --> 01:18:26.942
You mean that's your fucking business.

01:18:27.186 --> 01:18:29.950
This whole damn case is getting crazy.

01:18:30.590 --> 01:18:32.353
You tell him about the glasses?

01:18:33.660 --> 01:18:36.151
Seems that Walker
always wore steel-rimmed glasses...

01:18:36.362 --> 01:18:39.126
...a real fanatic about them.
But they weren't on the scene.

01:18:39.332 --> 01:18:41.232
Coroner says
they should have been there.

01:18:41.434 --> 01:18:45.394
He says that even after the fire, the frames
would've been seared right into his...

01:18:46.173 --> 01:18:49.074
- You don't want to hear the details.
- So what?

01:18:49.276 --> 01:18:52.370
So it's looking more and more
like he was killed somewhere else...

01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:54.980
...and brought there in his own car.

01:18:55.349 --> 01:18:58.341
Your honey, his wife, said
he left the house in the night...

01:18:58.586 --> 01:19:02.283
...driving himself to some mysterious
meeting. Is that vague enough for you?

01:19:03.023 --> 01:19:05.753
Look, what is this?
What do you want?

01:19:05.993 --> 01:19:09.121
Am I supposed to be an undercover agent
for you guys, or something?

01:19:09.363 --> 01:19:12.799
- That's an interesting choice of phrase.
- Well, suppose tonight I ask her:

01:19:13.033 --> 01:19:16.662
"Say, did you kill your husband?
My friends were just wondering."

01:19:17.271 --> 01:19:22.039
That's a great idea. While you're at it, ask
where the glasses are, where she did it...

01:19:22.243 --> 01:19:24.211
Am I forgetting anything, Oscar?

01:19:24.446 --> 01:19:25.970
- That one thing.
- Oh, yeah.

01:19:26.181 --> 01:19:28.649
You're going to love
this latest development.

01:19:28.883 --> 01:19:31.750
This is from the sister-in-law,
the Kraft woman.

01:19:32.253 --> 01:19:35.882
She's driving me batty. She's convinced
she won't be cut in on the will.

01:19:36.091 --> 01:19:38.150
It seems a couple of weeks
before the murder...

01:19:38.393 --> 01:19:41.453
...Walker's niece spent a while up here
with your friend Matty.

01:19:41.696 --> 01:19:45.291
One night, she wakes up,
goes to see her aunt...

01:19:45.967 --> 01:19:47.764
...and catches the lady with some guy.

01:19:48.003 --> 01:19:50.972
You get it?
In the act, or some fucking thing.

01:19:51.806 --> 01:19:54.536
We don't have the details yet,
but Mrs. Kraft...

01:19:54.743 --> 01:19:57.405
...is bringing the little girl up here
to tell her story.

01:19:57.746 --> 01:20:00.944
They're here. I passed them
on the way in. They're waiting outside.

01:20:01.283 --> 01:20:02.807
Christ.

01:20:03.052 --> 01:20:05.816
I'm not sure I'm up to
dealing with this scene.

01:20:08.090 --> 01:20:10.024
Listen...

01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:15.453
...you probably don't want
to see the Kraft woman right now.

01:20:15.698 --> 01:20:20.101
She's pretty wild. Why don't you
just slip out the back way here.

01:20:21.971 --> 01:20:23.632
Are we done here?

01:20:25.608 --> 01:20:27.576
Yeah, I've got it all here.

01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:34.912
- Ned, I'm sorry I had to ask.
- I'll go out this way.

01:20:36.619 --> 01:20:40.181
I've had a lot of experience
with disgruntled people.

01:20:47.064 --> 01:20:48.861
I'll be at Stella's.

01:20:58.141 --> 01:20:59.972
Hello, Mrs. Kraft.

01:21:00.877 --> 01:21:02.742
Hello, Mr. Racine.

01:21:02.979 --> 01:21:04.344
How are you making out?

01:21:04.581 --> 01:21:06.606
We're doing all right, I guess.

01:21:08.518 --> 01:21:10.383
You must be Heather.

01:21:11.054 --> 01:21:14.319
I'm Ned Racine. I've heard a lot
about you. It's nice to meet you.

01:21:14.558 --> 01:21:15.685
Thank you.

01:21:17.328 --> 01:21:19.796
I'm sorry our town
is so hot for your visit.

01:21:20.031 --> 01:21:21.794
It sure is.

01:21:23.034 --> 01:21:24.331
Well...

01:21:24.769 --> 01:21:26.930
...goodbye.
- Bye.

01:21:27.138 --> 01:21:29.003
Bye.

01:21:40.151 --> 01:21:42.949
- The usual, my sweet.
- Two iced teas for Fred Astaire.

01:21:43.187 --> 01:21:45.747
Rosemary, I'm going out for 10 minutes.

01:21:47.225 --> 01:21:50.991
- Ready to hear something really wild?
- I don't know, I've had my share today.

01:21:51.229 --> 01:21:53.198
No, this is right up your alley.

01:21:59.638 --> 01:22:01.105
Little Heather...

01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:04.275
...goes out on the porch
and there's this dude with her aunt.

01:22:04.510 --> 01:22:07.411
And the guy is turned around
with his pants or shorts dropped...

01:22:07.646 --> 01:22:09.580
...so he's mooning the little girl.

01:22:09.815 --> 01:22:13.581
He and your friend are going at something
that Heather can't quite figure out...

01:22:13.819 --> 01:22:17.016
...but which sounds suspiciously to me
like oral-genital contact...

01:22:17.256 --> 01:22:20.054
...which I'm proud to say is no longer
illegal in this state.

01:22:20.292 --> 01:22:24.160
And the guy turns around to Heather.
Do you follow me so far?

01:22:24.763 --> 01:22:27.288
- Guess what he looks like.
- I don't know.

01:22:27.533 --> 01:22:32.130
He looks about seven or eight
inches long, shiny and very, very bald.

01:22:36.009 --> 01:22:37.636
Poor little Heather.

01:22:37.877 --> 01:22:40.471
She'd never seen one angry before.

01:22:40.713 --> 01:22:43.341
Made quite an impression on her.
Yes, sirree.

01:22:43.583 --> 01:22:46.916
- That's all she can remember about the guy.
- That's it?

01:22:47.220 --> 01:22:48.517
No, no.

01:22:49.622 --> 01:22:51.419
One other thing.

01:22:52.058 --> 01:22:55.050
She said the guy had very greasy hair,
wore it slicked back.

01:22:55.295 --> 01:22:58.594
"Like a Cuban," she says.
I love that part.

01:22:59.332 --> 01:23:01.163
Can you imagine poor little Heather?

01:23:01.401 --> 01:23:04.268
After getting a gander at that,
she has to slip back to bed.

01:23:04.504 --> 01:23:07.132
This is the capper,
why she woke up in the first place:

01:23:07.373 --> 01:23:08.466
She had a nightmare.

01:23:08.709 --> 01:23:12.145
Can you imagine the kind of dreams
she had for the rest of the night?

01:23:17.852 --> 01:23:20.116
Don't say that.
Don't say you don't have them.

01:23:20.354 --> 01:23:22.413
I swear to you, I don't.
What's wrong with you?

01:23:22.623 --> 01:23:25.148
They had to be here that night
when you cleaned up.

01:23:25.359 --> 01:23:27.589
Think. They've probably
got my prints on them.

01:23:27.795 --> 01:23:30.696
I must have missed them.
I thought they were on Edmund.

01:23:30.931 --> 01:23:33.491
- Where could they have gone?!
- I don't know.

01:23:37.071 --> 01:23:38.470
- Betty.
- The housekeeper?

01:23:38.672 --> 01:23:40.367
Where would she have put them?

01:23:40.608 --> 01:23:43.805
She might have taken them.
Listen to me. That's why I fired her...

01:23:44.011 --> 01:23:46.913
...because after Edmund's death,
she started acting strangely.

01:23:47.115 --> 01:23:49.310
She was always watching me,
listening to my calls.

01:23:49.551 --> 01:23:51.314
That is crazy.
You imagined it.

01:23:51.553 --> 01:23:54.317
I know. I've been imagining
things too. Plenty.

01:23:54.556 --> 01:23:56.615
No, I could tell
there was a difference.

01:23:56.925 --> 01:24:00.326
Maybe she knew about us.
Maybe she wants something.

01:24:00.562 --> 01:24:03.463
Don't you think we'd have
heard from her by now?

01:24:03.765 --> 01:24:05.858
I don't know what to think.

01:24:06.635 --> 01:24:08.193
I'm worried, Ned.

01:24:09.371 --> 01:24:13.603
But it's not about the glasses
or your friends, it's us.

01:24:14.009 --> 01:24:16.978
Your first reaction is to accuse me.

01:24:17.312 --> 01:24:20.145
- What's happening to you?
- I'm sorry.

01:24:23.351 --> 01:24:24.979
Hardin called today.

01:24:25.721 --> 01:24:29.487
He said everything should be cleared up
by next week. I'll get the money.

01:24:29.692 --> 01:24:31.660
He apologized for the delay.

01:24:32.628 --> 01:24:35.119
They've been stalling.
They're dragging it out...

01:24:35.364 --> 01:24:37.764
...hoping to find a way
to implicate you.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.934
But they haven't been able to.

01:24:40.970 --> 01:24:43.302
Soon it will be all ours.

01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:46.770
That's why we've got
to stay together, Ned.

01:24:47.276 --> 01:24:48.436
It won't be long...

01:24:48.678 --> 01:24:52.307
...then we can get away from here,
out from under all of this.

01:24:53.816 --> 01:24:56.046
All we have is each other.

01:24:57.954 --> 01:25:01.412
I'd kill myself if I thought
this thing would destroy us.

01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:05.155
I couldn't take it.

01:26:38.457 --> 01:26:39.754
That's great.

01:26:40.092 --> 01:26:42.151
- Hi, Ned.
- What are you doing here?

01:26:42.694 --> 01:26:45.595
I was looking for you.
Do you always run this late?

01:26:45.831 --> 01:26:48.732
No. I'm going down to Miami tomorrow.
I won't have time.

01:26:49.935 --> 01:26:53.632
- What's in Miami?
- I'm closing that real estate deal.

01:26:56.042 --> 01:26:58.203
You're some kind of health nut.

01:26:59.813 --> 01:27:02.077
Matty Walker smokes that same brand,
I noticed that.

01:27:02.282 --> 01:27:06.116
Is this one of those conversations?
Maybe my lawyer should be present.

01:27:06.352 --> 01:27:08.479
Buddy, your lawyer is present.

01:27:18.431 --> 01:27:22.800
Walker was a bad guy, and the more I find
out about him, the happier I am he's dead.

01:27:23.036 --> 01:27:26.096
I figure it's a positive thing
for the world.

01:27:26.339 --> 01:27:28.739
You're not known for being a hard-liner.

01:27:28.975 --> 01:27:32.138
I have my own standards.
I just try to keep them private.

01:27:36.550 --> 01:27:39.041
As far as I'm concern,
I don't care who killed him...

01:27:39.253 --> 01:27:41.983
...and I don't care
who gets rich because of it.

01:27:44.825 --> 01:27:47.851
But Oscar... Oscar is not like that.

01:27:49.330 --> 01:27:52.766
His whole life is based on
doing the right thing.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.831
He's the only one I know like that.

01:27:55.069 --> 01:27:58.470
Sometimes, it's a real pain in the ass,
even for him.

01:28:02.009 --> 01:28:04.876
Oscar's unhappy right now.
He is in pain.

01:28:05.112 --> 01:28:07.910
- Why is that?
- Because he likes you.

01:28:08.749 --> 01:28:10.512
He likes you even better than I do.

01:28:10.718 --> 01:28:14.280
That's why he's busting his butt
trying to find this Mary Ann Simpson.

01:28:16.258 --> 01:28:18.749
They found her place
in Miami yesterday.

01:28:19.761 --> 01:28:23.663
But the woman herself was gone.
Seems like she left in a hurry.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.833
Oscar thought any story
she could tell might help.

01:28:28.203 --> 01:28:30.000
He thinks you need help.

01:28:37.245 --> 01:28:40.009
Someone is putting you
into deep trouble, my friend.

01:28:41.449 --> 01:28:44.179
From 3:30 to 5 a.m.
On the night Walker was killed...

01:28:44.419 --> 01:28:47.320
...someone called
your hotel room repeatedly.

01:28:47.556 --> 01:28:50.025
The hotel didn't want
to put them through...

01:28:50.259 --> 01:28:53.126
...but whoever it was
convinced him it was an emergency.

01:28:53.763 --> 01:28:56.857
Your phone rang and rang,
but you didn't answer.

01:28:57.099 --> 01:29:00.466
- That's easy.
- Don't. Don't say anything.

01:29:00.703 --> 01:29:03.171
Just save it for some other time.

01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:06.139
It gets worse.

01:29:10.413 --> 01:29:13.712
Now someone's trying
to give us Edmund's glasses.

01:29:17.253 --> 01:29:21.883
We don't know who, and we don't know
what the glasses will tell us...

01:29:22.792 --> 01:29:25.420
...but our negotiations are continuing.

01:29:35.272 --> 01:29:38.639
Wish I knew what to tell you,
but I don't have any good ideas.

01:29:48.485 --> 01:29:49.918
I'll see you.

01:30:27.325 --> 01:30:28.952
We know each other, don't we?

01:30:29.193 --> 01:30:31.889
Michael Glenn, with Bashford-Hillerman.

01:30:32.997 --> 01:30:34.521
Ned Racine.

01:30:35.900 --> 01:30:38.130
Christ, I've done it again.

01:30:38.436 --> 01:30:41.303
I'm just here waiting for some people.

01:30:44.610 --> 01:30:45.804
This is silly.

01:30:46.045 --> 01:30:49.139
You're not still mad
about that Gourson business?

01:30:50.082 --> 01:30:54.678
We had to do it. Costanza practically
insisted that we sue you.

01:30:55.321 --> 01:30:58.188
Nobody at our place likes malpractice
against other lawyers.

01:30:58.424 --> 01:30:59.448
Forget it.

01:31:02.561 --> 01:31:04.461
I tried to make it up to you.

01:31:06.932 --> 01:31:08.991
You ever meet a lady
named Matty Walker?

01:31:09.868 --> 01:31:11.267
You'd remember her.

01:31:11.503 --> 01:31:13.471
- A very hot number.
- Matty Walker.

01:31:13.672 --> 01:31:15.139
Yeah, I met her at a party.

01:31:15.374 --> 01:31:20.368
She said she was going up there
and wanted to know about lawyers.

01:31:21.581 --> 01:31:23.640
- So I gave her your name.
- When was this?

01:31:23.850 --> 01:31:27.581
Oh, boy, a long time.
Maybe last year sometime.

01:31:27.821 --> 01:31:31.587
- I gotta get going.
- Did you tell her about the Gourson case?

01:31:31.791 --> 01:31:34.282
Hey, pal, I was trying to get you work.

01:31:35.295 --> 01:31:36.694
Jesus! Are you nuts?

01:31:36.930 --> 01:31:38.864
Did you tell her about Gourson?

01:31:39.099 --> 01:31:42.262
Maybe I told her how we met.
Yeah, maybe.

01:32:10.464 --> 01:32:13.024
Is there something wrong
with your phone?

01:32:14.301 --> 01:32:16.292
It's just off the hook. Why?

01:32:17.071 --> 01:32:20.370
Teddy Lewis is in county.
He's very anxious to talk to you.

01:32:23.611 --> 01:32:25.476
I don't know. It's a thing in Lauderdale.

01:32:25.679 --> 01:32:28.648
Something must have gone wrong,
but they're not telling me.

01:32:29.417 --> 01:32:31.647
- I'm a little worried.
- I'll find out.

01:32:32.420 --> 01:32:34.445
No, that's not why I called you.

01:32:34.688 --> 01:32:36.623
In fact, I got me another lawyer.

01:32:40.829 --> 01:32:42.729
I think it would be better.

01:32:43.398 --> 01:32:44.888
You know...

01:32:45.767 --> 01:32:48.668
- You know Schlisgal?
- Yeah, he's good.

01:32:53.041 --> 01:32:57.239
This broad came to me last week,
a real looker.

01:32:57.479 --> 01:33:00.209
She said that you told her
how she could reach me...

01:33:00.449 --> 01:33:03.885
...and I figured that you must have
because she knew all about it.

01:33:04.119 --> 01:33:06.519
She said that you wanted another one.

01:33:09.925 --> 01:33:14.124
She had me show her how to
rig it to a door with a little delay.

01:33:14.330 --> 01:33:17.265
Does any of this mean anything to you?

01:33:19.402 --> 01:33:22.200
Then I'm glad I told you.
You better watch your step.

01:33:24.507 --> 01:33:25.997
Thanks, Teddy.

01:33:28.277 --> 01:33:31.508
Racine, don't thank me yet,
because...

01:33:32.281 --> 01:33:35.216
...these guys have been
asking me about The Breakers.

01:33:39.155 --> 01:33:42.784
I ain't told them shit, but I don't like
the look on their faces.

01:34:32.877 --> 01:34:34.902
Mr. Racine's office.

01:34:36.915 --> 01:34:39.782
Ned, Mrs. Walker.
Do you want her?

01:34:42.086 --> 01:34:43.383
Yeah.

01:34:58.703 --> 01:35:02.002
- Hello.
<i>- Hello, Ned. Can we talk?</i>

01:35:04.108 --> 01:35:05.405
Okay.

01:35:06.578 --> 01:35:08.706
- Where are you?
<i>- I'm in Miami.</i>

01:35:08.948 --> 01:35:12.782
<i>I've been running around like crazy,</i>
<i>and I couldn't reach you before I left.</i>

01:35:13.018 --> 01:35:15.543
<i>Ned, everything is going to be all right.</i>

01:35:16.021 --> 01:35:18.148
- Tell me.
<i>- I've got the money.</i>

01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:22.258
<i>I've taken it and sent it</i>
<i>somewhere safe. It's all ours now.</i>

01:35:23.362 --> 01:35:26.024
<i>- But that's not the best part.</i>
- What's the best part?

01:35:26.265 --> 01:35:28.563
<i>The glasses. I got them back.</i>

01:35:28.801 --> 01:35:31.269
<i>That is, they should be ours by now.</i>
<i>Betty had them.</i>

01:35:31.503 --> 01:35:34.165
<i>She wanted money.</i>
<i>That's why I had to come down here.</i>

01:35:34.406 --> 01:35:37.466
<i>She made it all very difficult,</i>
<i>but I think it worked out.</i>

01:35:38.043 --> 01:35:41.035
- Do you have them?
<i>- No. She wouldn't do that.</i>

01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:45.513
<i>She's putting them in the boathouse.</i>
<i>In the top drawer of the dresser.</i>

01:35:45.752 --> 01:35:48.380
<i>They should be there now</i>
<i>if she's kept up her end.</i>

01:35:49.889 --> 01:35:51.083
Yeah.

01:35:51.291 --> 01:35:54.658
<i>I think you'd better get them right away.</i>
<i>I don't trust her.</i>

01:35:56.396 --> 01:35:58.626
- In the boathouse?
<i>- That's right.</i>

01:35:58.865 --> 01:36:00.992
<i>The top drawer of the dresser.</i>

01:36:01.234 --> 01:36:03.429
<i>Ned, we're going to be all right.</i>

01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:08.166
<i>I'll leave here as soon as I can.</i>
<i>I should be there by 7:30.</i>

01:36:08.608 --> 01:36:12.237
<i>I can't wait to see you, darling.</i>
<i>We've made it.</i>

01:36:14.414 --> 01:36:15.813
<i>Are you all right?</i>

01:36:16.650 --> 01:36:17.981
Yeah.

01:36:18.985 --> 01:36:20.452
<i>Goodbye, sweetheart.</i>

01:38:03.826 --> 01:38:05.350
I better go get him.

01:40:36.683 --> 01:40:38.207
Hello, darling.

01:40:38.485 --> 01:40:39.782
Hello, Matty.

01:40:41.988 --> 01:40:44.752
- Where's your car?
- It's out back with yours.

01:40:45.926 --> 01:40:48.862
- Why didn't you turn the lights on?
- I could see.

01:40:52.300 --> 01:40:54.063
It's all ours now.

01:40:56.537 --> 01:40:58.698
We could leave tonight if we wanted to.

01:41:00.908 --> 01:41:03.399
- It's all over.
- Yes, it is.

01:41:05.379 --> 01:41:07.040
What is that?

01:41:07.381 --> 01:41:09.747
It's Edmund's gun.
You remember it, don't you?

01:41:10.351 --> 01:41:12.285
What is it, Ned. What's happened?

01:41:12.486 --> 01:41:14.716
- I think you know.
- No, I swear I don't.

01:41:14.956 --> 01:41:16.617
It's the glasses, Matty.

01:41:17.224 --> 01:41:20.557
Weren't they there?
Didn't she bring them?

01:41:21.262 --> 01:41:22.729
I didn't see them.

01:41:24.031 --> 01:41:26.262
She promised me she would bring them.

01:41:26.501 --> 01:41:30.870
Maybe I missed them,
the way you missed them that night.

01:41:31.373 --> 01:41:34.103
I don't know what you're thinking,
but you're wrong.

01:41:34.476 --> 01:41:36.137
I'd never do anything to hurt you.

01:41:36.645 --> 01:41:40.411
- I love you. You've got to believe that.
- Keep talking, Matty.

01:41:40.649 --> 01:41:43.777
Experience shows
I can be convinced of anything.

01:41:50.492 --> 01:41:53.723
I did arrange to meet you, Ned.
But that all changed.

01:41:53.962 --> 01:41:58.365
You changed it. I fell in love
with you. I didn't plan that.

01:41:58.967 --> 01:42:01.868
You never quit, do you?
You just keep on coming.

01:42:02.104 --> 01:42:04.767
How can I prove it to you?
What can I say?

01:42:05.008 --> 01:42:08.171
The glasses, Matty.
Why don't you go down there...

01:42:09.178 --> 01:42:10.668
...and get them?

01:42:11.381 --> 01:42:13.315
You said they weren't there.

01:42:13.583 --> 01:42:16.279
I said I didn't see them.

01:42:33.403 --> 01:42:34.836
I'll go, Ned.

01:42:36.773 --> 01:42:38.604
I'll go and look for them.

01:42:52.356 --> 01:42:53.687
Ned...

01:42:54.491 --> 01:42:56.823
...no matter what you think...

01:42:57.828 --> 01:42:59.523
...I do love you.

01:43:19.851 --> 01:43:21.079
No.

01:43:23.254 --> 01:43:24.551
Matty!

01:44:08.033 --> 01:44:09.295
She's alive.

01:44:14.306 --> 01:44:16.467
They found the body in the boathouse.

01:44:17.443 --> 01:44:20.378
What if that was
somebody else's body in the boat house?

01:44:20.613 --> 01:44:24.014
What if it was already there
when I got there, dead and waiting for me?

01:44:24.250 --> 01:44:26.548
Maybe her friend, Mary Ann.

01:44:27.686 --> 01:44:30.154
Her teeth were left, man.

01:44:31.090 --> 01:44:34.890
They were sent back to Illinois.
The identification was positive.

01:44:35.662 --> 01:44:37.459
That was her.

01:44:37.697 --> 01:44:40.689
That was Matty Tyler Walker.

01:44:41.168 --> 01:44:44.365
That was her, and she is dead.

01:44:44.604 --> 01:44:47.198
You are not listening to me.

01:44:48.675 --> 01:44:52.167
Maybe she was using this
other girl's name...

01:44:52.412 --> 01:44:55.108
...since she first met Walker
three years ago...

01:44:55.348 --> 01:44:59.182
...since she first spotted him decided
to take him, one way or the other.

01:44:59.786 --> 01:45:01.048
Maybe...

01:45:02.055 --> 01:45:06.116
...Walker, or any of us,
never knew her real name.

01:45:06.393 --> 01:45:08.588
Why would she want to hide her identity?

01:45:08.795 --> 01:45:10.422
I don't know.

01:45:10.830 --> 01:45:13.925
Maybe because there was something
in her past, something so bad...

01:45:14.168 --> 01:45:16.762
...she thought it would queer it
with Walker if he knew...

01:45:17.004 --> 01:45:18.938
...that he'd never marry her.

01:45:24.545 --> 01:45:25.876
Let's say...

01:45:26.113 --> 01:45:30.709
...that she's living as this other girl,
this person from her past.

01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:34.880
So there's only one person
in the whole world...

01:45:35.122 --> 01:45:37.454
...who knows who she really is.

01:45:38.192 --> 01:45:40.990
And then just when she's got me
on the line...

01:45:42.263 --> 01:45:46.222
...she's finally going to collect,
that person shows up.

01:45:46.467 --> 01:45:50.062
That girl finds her
and threatens to expose her...

01:45:50.304 --> 01:45:52.705
...so Matty starts paying her off.

01:45:53.108 --> 01:45:55.906
Maybe she even promised to cut her
in on Edmund's money.

01:45:58.213 --> 01:46:01.478
Now she's got to share it
with two people.

01:46:03.552 --> 01:46:05.816
But then Matty sees a way...

01:46:06.054 --> 01:46:09.046
...to get rid of both of us at once.

01:46:12.094 --> 01:46:13.686
At the boathouse.

01:46:15.931 --> 01:46:19.094
A way to solve all her problems...

01:46:19.334 --> 01:46:22.792
...and get clear
with no one looking for her.

01:46:24.573 --> 01:46:29.375
She was right too, because I would have
never stopped looking for her.

01:46:32.448 --> 01:46:34.507
Matty killed this other girl...

01:46:34.751 --> 01:46:37.618
...and put her body in the boathouse.

01:46:38.821 --> 01:46:40.288
It was so...

01:46:41.024 --> 01:46:43.219
...perfect. So...

01:46:44.761 --> 01:46:46.490
...clean.

01:46:48.097 --> 01:46:51.965
You find two bodies,
me and this girl...

01:46:52.201 --> 01:46:54.795
...two killers, dead.

01:46:55.338 --> 01:46:56.805
Case closed.

01:46:58.441 --> 01:47:02.104
You can't find the money, can you?
Doesn't that tell you something?

01:47:02.345 --> 01:47:06.213
It tells me she moved it, and we can't
find it, and that don't mean shit.

01:47:07.584 --> 01:47:09.245
It could be sitting...

01:47:09.486 --> 01:47:14.753
...in a bank anywhere in the world waiting
for some dead lady to come for it.

01:47:18.462 --> 01:47:20.828
Do you hear what you're saying?
It's crazy.

01:47:21.065 --> 01:47:23.863
This Matty would have to be one quick,
smart broad.

01:47:25.636 --> 01:47:30.403
Oscar, don't you understand?
That was her special gift.

01:47:30.974 --> 01:47:33.272
She was relentless.

01:47:40.084 --> 01:47:43.349
Matty was the kind of person
who could do what was necessary.

01:47:50.528 --> 01:47:52.792
Whatever was necessary.

01:48:03.808 --> 01:48:06.003
Is that what you've been waiting for?

01:50:12.540 --> 01:50:13.734
What?

01:50:15.076 --> 01:50:16.567
It is hot.

01:50:21.850 --> 01:50:23.249
Yes.
