WEBVTT

00:09.785 --> 00:11.918
- Hello.
- Hey, how was your afternoon?

00:11.985 --> 00:13.585
Do you know
what this wonderful man did?

00:13.785 --> 00:15.451
Oh, Daphne, please don't...

00:15.651 --> 00:18.785
He filled a basket
full of me favourite English foods:

00:18.918 --> 00:21.585
Blood pudding,
jellied eels, kidney pie.

00:21.785 --> 00:23.585
Then he hid it in the shrubs

00:23.785 --> 00:26.118
so we'd stumble upon it
during our stroll through the park.

00:26.251 --> 00:28.785
I was afraid that somebody
would find it before we got there,

00:28.918 --> 00:30.451
but fortunately, untouched.

00:30.585 --> 00:33.918
Yes. Just because it was untouched
doesn't mean someone didn't find it.

00:35.651 --> 00:37.251
- Hello, Dr. Crane.
- Hello, Daphne.

00:37.518 --> 00:38.585
Donny.

00:39.785 --> 00:43.318
Hey, tiger.
Look what I got for you. Think fast.

00:45.985 --> 00:49.318
- What are the keys to?
- Your ex-wife's lakefront cottage.

00:49.585 --> 00:51.451
Now your lakefront cottage.

00:51.651 --> 00:54.251
A little something I hammered out
for you in the settlement.

00:54.451 --> 00:56.985
Thank you. Donny, I never thought
I'd see Shady Glen again.

00:57.851 --> 00:58.985
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

00:59.185 --> 01:00.985
Well, congratulations, Niles.

01:01.185 --> 01:04.650
Yeah, looks like Donny really did a job
on Maris' legal team.

01:04.918 --> 01:06.985
Yes, well, he certainly is ruthless,
all right.

01:07.185 --> 01:08.585
As a divorce lawyer,

01:08.851 --> 01:12.451
what a callous attitude he must have
toward human relationships.

01:12.651 --> 01:15.651
Yeah, you'd think so, Dr. Crane,
but actually, it's just the opposite.

01:15.851 --> 01:17.985
I've never met anyone
so incredibly romantic.

01:18.185 --> 01:20.518
Yes, well, I'm sure
he seems that way on the outside.

01:20.651 --> 01:22.985
Oh, Niles, please.

01:23.185 --> 01:25.651
It's unseemly enough
when she's actually in the room.

01:25.851 --> 01:28.518
I'm sorry.
What am I supposed to do?

01:28.651 --> 01:30.251
For the first time
since I've known her,

01:30.451 --> 01:32.318
I'm free and single
and now she's with someone.

01:32.518 --> 01:35.251
- I'm supposed to suffer in silence?
- I'd take that.

01:36.851 --> 01:39.518
I just don't understand.
What does she see in him?

01:39.651 --> 01:41.451
If you were Daphne,
would you go out with Donny?

01:41.651 --> 01:44.785
Well, no, but I wouldn't massage
Dad's ass for what I pay her either.

01:48.118 --> 01:49.118
Look, I'm sorry, Niles.

01:49.318 --> 01:51.318
Donny and Daphne
seem very happy together.

01:51.451 --> 01:54.785
Either it's true love, in which case
it's too late for you to declare yourself,

01:54.918 --> 01:56.518
or it's just a temporary infatuation.

01:56.651 --> 01:59.318
- It's got to be. It's got to be.
- In which case, it will pass.

01:59.518 --> 02:01.518
And then you can make your move.

02:01.785 --> 02:05.918
In the meantime, I suggest that maybe
you start looking elsewhere.

02:06.118 --> 02:07.518
You know, maybe make a fresh start.

02:07.651 --> 02:09.985
Do something
to get your mind off of Daphne.

02:10.185 --> 02:12.118
I know, I know, it's just difficult.

02:12.318 --> 02:14.585
Yes, I understand.
Say, you know what? I've got an idea.

02:14.851 --> 02:17.651
Why don't the three of us go to
that cabin of yours for the weekend?

02:17.851 --> 02:20.451
Sorry, I can't. I got a dentist
appointment Saturday morning.

02:20.585 --> 02:22.918
Niles can go up on Friday night,
put things together,

02:23.118 --> 02:25.251
and then you and I can drive up
on Saturday afternoon.

02:25.585 --> 02:27.251
Why not? It's a fabulous place, Dad.

02:27.451 --> 02:30.518
It's got a stereo and a big-screen TV
and a sauna, wine cellar.

02:30.651 --> 02:33.785
Perfect for three guys
roughing it in the wilderness.

02:34.185 --> 02:35.585
Well, I'm game.

02:35.851 --> 02:37.851
I can stop at the butcher,
pick up a couple of ducks

02:38.118 --> 02:40.185
and make my justly celebrated
duck à I'orange.

02:40.318 --> 02:43.251
Washed down with
a winsome-yet-robust Chambertin.

02:43.451 --> 02:44.518
- Chambertin.
- Yeah.

02:44.651 --> 02:46.785
I'll bring a quart of whisky
in case of snakebite.

02:46.918 --> 02:48.651
Dad, Dad,
there are no snakes up there.

02:48.851 --> 02:51.185
All right, I'll bring a snake.

02:52.451 --> 02:55.451
God, this is great, Niles.
I've gotta dash down to the mailbox,

02:55.585 --> 02:57.451
drop that letter in
before the last pick-up.

02:57.585 --> 02:59.651
Niles, trust me.

02:59.918 --> 03:01.985
You'll be glad
you took my advice on this one.

03:02.185 --> 03:03.318
I already am. Thank you.

03:03.451 --> 03:06.318
It's going to do me a world of good
to get away from Daphne for a while.

03:06.518 --> 03:07.785
Yes, I couldn't agree more.

03:08.318 --> 03:11.118
Hey, Daphne, how would you like
to see my new lakefront cottage?

03:11.251 --> 03:13.651
- Sounds lovely. When?
- This weekend.

03:13.918 --> 03:15.785
We're all going.
You can drive with me on Friday

03:15.918 --> 03:17.651
and Dad and Frasier
will be right behind.

03:17.785 --> 03:20.318
Oh, that's very sweet, Dr. Crane.
But I can't.

03:20.451 --> 03:22.785
One of me cousins is going
to San Francisco this weekend

03:22.918 --> 03:24.318
and I promised I'd fly down.

03:24.585 --> 03:26.318
- That's a shame.
- Yeah.

03:26.585 --> 03:28.185
Donny's not too thrilled
about it either.

03:28.451 --> 03:31.118
- He wanted to come with me.
- And he's not?

03:31.318 --> 03:34.518
No, that would have meant
staying in a hotel together,

03:34.785 --> 03:36.585
and I'm not sure
we're ready for that yet.

03:37.185 --> 03:39.585
I suppose you think
I'm being a bit old-fashioned.

03:39.785 --> 03:42.451
Dear God in heaven, no.

03:42.985 --> 03:44.518
You can't force these things.

03:44.651 --> 03:47.318
You have to wait for the moment
when you know it's right.

03:47.585 --> 03:51.251
And sometimes the moment never
comes and you just have to move on.

03:51.518 --> 03:54.585
I really appreciate the invitation
and I hope you'll invite me again.

03:54.851 --> 03:57.585
All right, Daphne, how would you like
to see my new lakefront cottage?

03:57.851 --> 03:58.851
You're silly.

04:00.000 --> 04:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:08.118 --> 04:09.918
- Martin, Niles.
- Hey.

04:09.985 --> 04:12.918
- Boy, this place is jammed.
- Here, Roz, you can have my seat.

04:13.118 --> 04:14.585
- I'm on my way to Duke's.
- Thank you.

04:14.785 --> 04:17.651
Yeah.
So how's the world treating you?

04:17.851 --> 04:19.317
Like dirt.

04:19.517 --> 04:21.918
My social life is non-existent.

04:22.185 --> 04:23.918
Every time I meet a guy
who's halfway decent,

04:24.118 --> 04:25.918
all I have to do
is mention I got a kid

04:26.118 --> 04:29.251
and he runs
like a cheap pair of pantyhose.

04:29.318 --> 04:31.585
Well, maybe you and Niles
can cheer each other up.

04:31.851 --> 04:33.518
- Dad.
- Why, what's his problem?

04:33.651 --> 04:35.918
Daphne's got a new boyfriend
and it's eating him up.

04:36.185 --> 04:38.451
- Dad.
- What? You got a thing for Daphne?

04:38.585 --> 04:40.251
You didn't know that
after all these years?

04:40.518 --> 04:42.118
No, I can't believe
Daphne never told me.

04:42.251 --> 04:43.918
How could she?
She doesn't know either.

04:44.185 --> 04:46.651
- You're kidding.
- Yes. Yes, he's a great kidder.

04:46.851 --> 04:50.318
Now, you, Dad, run along and you
be very careful crossing streets.

04:50.518 --> 04:52.185
Six years, can you believe it?

04:52.318 --> 04:54.985
Some people just don't even know
when it's time to pull the plug.

04:55.185 --> 04:58.318
Well, I won't make
that mistake twice.

04:59.251 --> 05:00.985
So let me get this straight.

05:01.185 --> 05:02.785
You've been hot for Daphne
all this time

05:02.918 --> 05:04.585
and you've never made a move?

05:04.785 --> 05:07.518
- I was a happily married man.
- You were never happy.

05:07.651 --> 05:09.918
And you've been separated
for almost two years.

05:10.185 --> 05:13.185
Well, somehow,
the right moment never came along.

05:13.318 --> 05:14.785
Oh, come on.

05:14.985 --> 05:19.785
I'm not trying to make you feel bad,
it's just, waiting all this time,

05:19.918 --> 05:22.785
and now she's got a boyfriend.

05:22.918 --> 05:26.585
My God, that is really pathetic.

05:27.185 --> 05:28.585
Obviously, you've never let someone

05:28.785 --> 05:30.918
you've grown to care deeply about
get away.

05:31.118 --> 05:32.185
Well, sure I have.

05:32.451 --> 05:33.518
I'm not talking about

05:33.651 --> 05:36.318
when the migrant workers
leave at the end of the picking season.

05:41.118 --> 05:42.785
No, really.
I've had a couple of boyfriends

05:42.918 --> 05:44.918
I shouldn't have let get away.

05:45.118 --> 05:46.918
- Serious relationships?
- Yeah.

05:47.118 --> 05:48.918
I can name one
right off the top of my head.

05:48.985 --> 05:51.451
That lawyer I gave you, Donny.

05:51.585 --> 05:53.251
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:53.451 --> 05:55.651
I mean,
you only know him professionally,

05:55.851 --> 05:59.585
but he's very funny,
warm, thoughtful.

06:00.518 --> 06:02.251
We were together
for about six months,

06:02.451 --> 06:04.518
but he really wanted a family
and I wasn't ready

06:04.651 --> 06:05.918
so I dumped him.

06:05.985 --> 06:08.918
Now I have the family,
but no Donny.

06:09.185 --> 06:10.918
Gee, I wonder
who he's seeing these days.

06:13.918 --> 06:17.318
- What's so funny?
- I'll tell you in a minute.

06:17.518 --> 06:20.451
I just want to savour it.
You've been having all the fun.

06:21.118 --> 06:22.451
So tell me.

06:23.251 --> 06:25.118
Donny is Daphne's boyfriend.

06:25.651 --> 06:29.251
That's not funny.
When did this happen?

06:29.518 --> 06:32.185
Well, she met him
when he was working on my case.

06:33.185 --> 06:36.118
Wow, and I was calling you a loser.

06:36.318 --> 06:39.585
- You never called me a loser.
- In my head I did.

06:41.318 --> 06:43.185
Well, at the moment,
I have to agree with you.

06:43.451 --> 06:47.651
I've had plenty of opportunities
and I always chickened out.

06:47.918 --> 06:49.851
Don't blame yourself.

06:49.985 --> 06:52.118
She's living with your brother,
working for your dad.

06:52.451 --> 06:55.251
- It's an awkward situation.
- It is.

06:55.451 --> 06:57.785
Well, don't feel bad about Donny.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.651
It wasn't right for you at the time,
that's nobody's fault.

07:01.185 --> 07:02.651
Thanks, Niles.

07:03.851 --> 07:05.785
Listen, the next time
you find somebody you like,

07:05.985 --> 07:07.851
don't wait so long to tell her.

07:09.118 --> 07:10.651
I've got a babysitter waiting.

07:10.785 --> 07:13.251
Mrs. Hines is 70 years old,

07:13.451 --> 07:14.851
has a mole like Abe Lincoln,

07:14.918 --> 07:17.985
but I bet
she has plans for the weekend.

07:18.185 --> 07:21.318
You know what?
I just had the craziest idea.

07:21.518 --> 07:24.251
My settlement with Maris
includes a beautiful lakefront cottage,

07:24.318 --> 07:26.785
and I'm going up there this afternoon.

07:26.918 --> 07:29.851
Why don't you come along?
You can bring Alice.

07:29.985 --> 07:31.118
Are you serious?

07:31.251 --> 07:33.118
Well, Frasier and Dad
are coming up tomorrow.

07:33.251 --> 07:34.851
But tonight, it'd just be us.

07:34.985 --> 07:38.251
Love's losers, licking our wounds,
laughing at our pain.

07:38.918 --> 07:40.785
Gee, I don't know, l...

07:40.918 --> 07:43.785
Frasier's making duck à I'orange
and I'm bringing the wine.

07:43.918 --> 07:45.585
What about it?

07:45.785 --> 07:48.985
I never thought I'd say this,
but you're on.

07:51.185 --> 07:52.451
In a funny way, this reminds me

07:52.585 --> 07:54.785
<i>of that wonderful moment
in Streetcar Named Desire</i>

07:54.918 --> 07:57.918
when the brutish Stanley
says to the ultra-refined Blanche:

07:58.118 --> 08:01.251
"We've had this date with each other
from the beginning."

08:01.518 --> 08:02.585
I don't know the play well,

08:02.785 --> 08:04.851
but I can tell you right now,
I'm not that refined.

08:05.118 --> 08:07.585
Actually, I was picturing you
more as Stanley.

08:15.585 --> 08:17.985
- Hi there.
- Donny, so glad you could make it.

08:18.185 --> 08:19.251
Well, thanks for inviting me.

08:19.518 --> 08:21.651
This is a great place
to get some work done.

08:21.851 --> 08:23.585
And no distractions in sight.

08:23.918 --> 08:26.851
- Thank...
- Donny, I'd like to introduce...

08:26.985 --> 08:30.118
Oh, that's right.
You two know each other, don't you?

08:30.585 --> 08:34.184
- Roz, how the hell are you? Hi.
- Donny.

08:34.318 --> 08:36.985
I didn't know you were gonna be here.
This is gonna be fun.

08:37.251 --> 08:38.918
I gotta put these somewhere.
Where do I go?

08:39.184 --> 08:41.184
- Just in one of the bedrooms upstairs.
- Okay.

08:41.318 --> 08:45.518
But be careful not to wake Roz's baby.
She's in that first room.

08:46.585 --> 08:48.251
Roz, you've got a baby?

08:48.518 --> 08:51.185
Congratulations.
That means that you're...

08:51.451 --> 08:53.851
Married? Nope. She's free as a bird.

08:54.918 --> 08:57.651
Well, I'll try to be quiet.

08:59.918 --> 09:01.985
- What the hell is this?
- What do you mean?

09:02.185 --> 09:05.118
I thought you might enjoy reminiscing
about all the good times you shared.

09:05.251 --> 09:08.318
Oh, no, you don't.
Donny is seeing Daphne,

09:08.518 --> 09:12.318
and I am not the kind
who steals other people's boyfriends.

09:12.518 --> 09:16.585
Not friends' boyfriends,
not good friends. Not again.

09:17.585 --> 09:20.451
Roz, you might recall
you went out with him for six months.

09:20.518 --> 09:22.118
She's only seen him
three or four times.

09:22.318 --> 09:25.585
- They're not even sleeping together.
- What? How would you know?

09:25.851 --> 09:27.251
She told me.

09:27.451 --> 09:30.318
I don't wanna be the bad guy here,
but you did have him first.

09:30.451 --> 09:32.585
And he did wanna make
a life with you.

09:33.451 --> 09:35.585
Listen, there is no way
that I am going...

09:35.785 --> 09:37.851
She hasn't slept with him?

09:38.585 --> 09:40.518
She's English.

09:42.451 --> 09:43.585
Why don't you just admit it?

09:43.785 --> 09:45.651
You're just doing this
because you want Daphne.

09:45.851 --> 09:49.985
Yes. Yes. Yes, I want Daphne.
I think we belong together,

09:50.118 --> 09:52.118
just like I think you and Donny
belong together.

09:52.185 --> 09:56.985
And why should two people be happy
when four people can be ecstatic?

09:59.185 --> 10:04.318
Well, you got a point there.
No. No, no, no, it's just not right.

10:04.518 --> 10:07.251
Roz, I swear I did not wake her.

10:07.451 --> 10:09.785
She was already up
when I went in to look at her.

10:09.851 --> 10:12.185
She's got such a sweet little face.

10:12.318 --> 10:14.918
- Her name is Alice.
- Hi, Alice, I'm Donny.

10:14.985 --> 10:17.251
She doesn't usually
let strangers hold her.

10:17.451 --> 10:20.518
I've always been pretty good with kids.
Come on, sweetie, come on.

10:20.785 --> 10:22.585
How's my hair?

10:28.785 --> 10:31.318
- Niles.
- Hey.

10:31.585 --> 10:33.318
Frasier, Dad.
What are you doing here today?

10:33.518 --> 10:36.251
Oh, my dentist is sick.
We had to reschedule.

10:36.518 --> 10:38.251
- Oh, no.
- It's just a head cold.

10:38.451 --> 10:40.318
Oh, God, you haven't
even heard the worst yet.

10:40.585 --> 10:42.651
Butcher shop was closed,
so here I am with my spices

10:42.851 --> 10:44.851
and everything I need
to make my duck à I'orange,

10:44.985 --> 10:46.518
all I've got is the I'orange.

10:46.785 --> 10:48.851
We're gonna have to get ducks
the old-fashioned way,

10:49.118 --> 10:51.185
but there's only
a couple of hours of daylight left.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.585
Yes. You know, I saw some boxes
of ammo in the mudroom.

10:53.851 --> 10:56.118
- Through the kitchen.
- No, Dad. Are you insane?

10:56.318 --> 10:58.785
I'm not gonna shoot any ducks.
It's barbaric.

10:58.985 --> 11:00.585
You'll eat them but you won't kill them.

11:00.851 --> 11:04.318
What do you think,
these things are born à I'orange?

11:05.985 --> 11:06.985
Dad does have a point.

11:07.185 --> 11:08.651
There is a duck blind
across the lake.

11:08.851 --> 11:10.918
It would be a good opportunity
for you two to bond.

11:11.118 --> 11:13.651
- Niles, what about you?
- I will stay here and season the pans.

11:13.851 --> 11:16.318
- I'm not going hunting.
- Then drive back to Seattle,

11:16.518 --> 11:18.651
find another shop that's open,
and come back tomorrow.

11:18.851 --> 11:20.651
What's going on?
You trying to get rid of us?

11:20.851 --> 11:24.251
- That's preposterous. Why should l...?
- Frasier, Martin.

11:24.518 --> 11:26.585
You weren't supposed to be here
until tomorrow.

11:26.851 --> 11:29.451
- Roz, what are you doing here?
- Niles brought me.

11:29.651 --> 11:32.585
I'm just gonna go
heat up a bottle for Alice.

11:39.451 --> 11:41.651
- Roz?
- Roz.

11:43.518 --> 11:45.451
Roz.

11:45.518 --> 11:49.318
Yes, so why don't you two run along
and leave me alone with Roz?

11:49.451 --> 11:50.585
Roz?

11:50.651 --> 11:53.185
Well, didn't you urge me
to make a fresh start?

11:53.451 --> 11:54.585
True, but I gotta tell you,

11:54.785 --> 11:57.118
Roz isn't the freshest start
you could make.

11:57.251 --> 12:00.518
Now, butt out, Frasier. If these two
wanna be alone together, that's fine.

12:00.651 --> 12:03.318
- Now, we're gonna go hunting.
- I'm not going hunting, Dad.

12:03.518 --> 12:07.185
Roz and Niles? Please,
you guys have nothing in common.

12:07.451 --> 12:08.785
Frasier, we're not getting married.

12:08.985 --> 12:10.918
We're going to spend
an afternoon together.

12:11.118 --> 12:13.451
There's nothing wrong
with trying something different.

12:13.518 --> 12:16.851
Which is what you're gonna do now.
So come on, let's go get some ducks.

12:16.985 --> 12:19.251
- Dad...
- Please, take as long as you need.

12:19.451 --> 12:21.918
- I don't wanna go hunting.
- Oh, come on.

12:21.985 --> 12:24.918
Didn't you ever hear the expression
"two's company, three's a crowd"?

12:24.985 --> 12:28.985
No, Dad, I don't think I ever did.
How does it go?

12:29.651 --> 12:31.451
I left some papers in the car.

12:31.585 --> 12:32.918
- Where'd you park?
- Out back.

12:33.185 --> 12:34.651
Then it's best to go
through the kitchen

12:34.851 --> 12:36.518
because we have
a loose plank on the porch.

12:36.785 --> 12:37.851
I already came in that way.

12:37.985 --> 12:40.251
Well, you cheated death once.
Don't push your luck.

12:41.118 --> 12:43.118
Niles, one last warning.

12:43.318 --> 12:44.851
Take it from someone
who knows you both.

12:44.985 --> 12:46.518
You and Roz are not a good couple.

12:46.651 --> 12:48.518
I understand your saying that,
but believe me,

12:48.651 --> 12:50.985
I have seen a new Roz
and underneath that brazen exterior,

12:51.251 --> 12:53.518
she is a sweet, sensitive, shy,
vulnerable woman.

12:53.651 --> 12:57.518
Niles? Have you seen my nipples?

13:05.785 --> 13:07.585
No.

13:11.651 --> 13:14.851
- Niles and Roz? It's just ridiculous.
- Oh, not this again.

13:14.918 --> 13:18.118
Well, they are just
completely incompatible.

13:18.251 --> 13:20.518
Well, haven't you ever heard
about opposites attracting?

13:20.651 --> 13:22.851
I mean, look at your mother and me.

13:22.918 --> 13:25.185
We went together six months,
nobody thought it'd last.

13:25.318 --> 13:27.451
We had 40 happy years together.

13:29.318 --> 13:31.318
- Never thought of it that way.
- Yeah.

13:31.585 --> 13:33.251
And then,
there are those relationships

13:33.451 --> 13:35.251
where people have
a ton of things in common,

13:35.318 --> 13:38.118
and of course,
they always work out real well.

13:39.185 --> 13:42.118
I suppose that was a backhanded
comment about me and Lilith.

13:42.251 --> 13:46.851
Wouldn't it be great if she was flying
by here on her broomstick right now?

13:47.985 --> 13:49.518
- Come on, sight up.
- No.

13:49.651 --> 13:51.318
No, I told you,
I'm not shooting anything.

13:51.518 --> 13:54.918
- All right, blow the duck call.
- Well, all right.

14:00.185 --> 14:03.251
Gee, you know,
I keep thinking about you and Mom.

14:03.518 --> 14:05.185
Maybe Niles and Roz
do have a chance.

14:05.451 --> 14:07.451
Well, sure they do. Blow it again.

14:12.985 --> 14:17.118
You know, I hope I didn't discourage
Niles too much by the way I reacted.

14:17.185 --> 14:19.451
You know how much stock
he puts in my opinion.

14:19.585 --> 14:21.451
Blow it, Frasier.

14:22.518 --> 14:24.851
I didn't mean the duck call.

14:28.585 --> 14:31.651
What about that time in Cancún
when the car breaks down

14:31.851 --> 14:33.518
and that guy gives us a ride
on his donkey.

14:33.785 --> 14:35.585
Niles, you have to hear this.

14:35.785 --> 14:37.851
Oh, God, I didn't realise
it'd gotten so late.

14:38.118 --> 14:41.785
I have to fax these contracts
to the office right away.

14:41.918 --> 14:43.451
You wouldn't happen
to have a machine?

14:43.651 --> 14:45.518
There's one in the study
right down that hall.

14:45.651 --> 14:49.318
But can't that wait?
We're all getting so mellow here.

14:49.985 --> 14:52.451
You're right. It can wait.
You know what we need?

14:52.585 --> 14:54.785
Another bottle of wine
and I brought one. I'll get it.

14:54.918 --> 14:56.985
Excellent, excellent.

14:58.585 --> 15:00.851
- Well, it's going well, don't you think?
- Yeah.

15:00.985 --> 15:03.118
Except your dad and Frasier
will be here any minute.

15:03.318 --> 15:05.918
And if either one of them
sees Donny, things are over.

15:06.118 --> 15:09.251
They're not gonna. You're gonna invite
him to watch the sunset by the lake.

15:09.451 --> 15:11.251
You're gonna work
your charms on him,

15:11.451 --> 15:13.318
then you're going to invite him
out to dinner,

15:13.518 --> 15:14.851
and who knows where that'll lead.

15:14.985 --> 15:17.118
What am I saying?
We both know where that'll lead.

15:17.651 --> 15:19.785
- You really think it'll work?
- Yes, yes, yes.

15:19.918 --> 15:21.785
You go there,
you enjoy that romantic sunset.

15:21.918 --> 15:23.251
- I'll stay with the baby.
- Okay.

15:23.451 --> 15:25.585
Oh, for heaven's sake.

15:25.785 --> 15:28.251
You're not gonna let her
go and enjoy the sunset by herself?

15:28.451 --> 15:30.185
Frasier, what are you doing back
so soon?

15:30.451 --> 15:33.451
I came back for some more ammo.
Who knew ducks were so shifty?

15:34.251 --> 15:36.585
Anyway, listen.

15:36.985 --> 15:39.518
I know that you took
my advice to heart,

15:39.651 --> 15:41.918
but I tell you, I've changed my mind.

15:42.185 --> 15:43.851
I now approve of you and Roz.

15:44.518 --> 15:47.118
- What?
- Yes, the two of you should go for it.

15:47.251 --> 15:48.985
Okay, come on.
Off you two go, let's go.

15:49.251 --> 15:51.118
- I don't think this is a good idea.
- Why not?

15:51.251 --> 15:52.918
I've changed my mind.
I'd rather stay here.

15:53.185 --> 15:54.251
What? You know what?

15:54.518 --> 15:56.985
You guys are putting
far too much stock in my opinion.

15:57.185 --> 16:00.251
Come on, let's get down to the lake
and enjoy that sunset.

16:00.451 --> 16:01.651
- But l...
- Let's go.

16:01.785 --> 16:04.518
No, not another word.
Down to the lake.

16:05.118 --> 16:07.851
Okay. I've got a...

16:11.851 --> 16:13.318
Alice.

16:13.451 --> 16:15.518
It's okay, honey.

16:31.318 --> 16:33.518
You wait here. I'll get Donny.

16:34.851 --> 16:38.651
You know, Roz is heading down
to the lake to catch that sunset.

16:38.851 --> 16:40.785
And you should be going
with her too.

16:40.918 --> 16:42.518
For God's sakes,
I told the two of you,

16:42.651 --> 16:44.918
I withdraw my objection.
Now, come on, let's go.

16:45.118 --> 16:46.651
I'm worried
about leaving Alice alone.

16:46.918 --> 16:48.851
Now, Roz, listen,
I will attend to the baby.

16:48.985 --> 16:50.585
I was about to make myself
a cup of tea.

16:50.851 --> 16:53.185
Now, come on, let's go.
March. Both of you, out the door.

16:53.451 --> 16:54.785
You'll enjoy that romantic sunset

16:54.985 --> 16:57.185
if I have to drag you
down there myself.

17:04.185 --> 17:06.185
Oh, okay.

17:17.185 --> 17:20.318
Good lord,
I just can't believe the two of them.

17:20.518 --> 17:24.185
Ridiculous behaviour. My God.

17:25.917 --> 17:27.585
- Daphne!
- Sorry.

17:27.785 --> 17:30.185
- Did I startle you?
- No, no, no, that's quite all right.

17:30.318 --> 17:33.851
It's just that if Niles knew
you were here, he would never...

17:34.518 --> 17:37.785
Well, forgive himself
for not being here to greet you.

17:37.918 --> 17:39.451
He wasn't expecting me.

17:39.518 --> 17:42.585
Me plans changed and I thought
I'd drive up and join you all.

17:42.785 --> 17:45.518
Well, isn't that nice?
You've got to leave.

17:45.651 --> 17:47.451
- Why?
- No, well, you see,

17:47.985 --> 17:51.318
Niles is up here for what a...
I think you Brits call

17:51.585 --> 17:54.185
a dirty weekend with someone.

17:54.251 --> 17:57.251
And the someone
happens to be Roz.

17:57.451 --> 17:58.985
Roz?

17:59.185 --> 18:00.785
You mean, "Roz" Roz.

18:00.985 --> 18:02.985
Yes, yes.
You've gotta get out of here.

18:03.251 --> 18:05.918
But I just drove two hours
and it's getting dark outside.

18:06.118 --> 18:07.318
All right, I'll tell you what.

18:07.518 --> 18:09.185
There's a bed-and-breakfast
up the road.

18:09.318 --> 18:11.518
I think Dad, you and I
should stay there this evening.

18:11.585 --> 18:12.851
- All right.
- Great.

18:12.985 --> 18:16.785
- Could I use the bathroom first?
- No, no, of course. Right in there.

18:19.251 --> 18:21.185
Dear God.

18:24.518 --> 18:25.585
Where's Donny?

18:25.785 --> 18:27.851
He can't be in the kitchen.
Frasier would've seen him.

18:28.118 --> 18:30.185
Look, the door. He must be up there.

18:30.318 --> 18:32.785
- You keep a look out. I'll go get him.
- Okay.

18:35.451 --> 18:38.118
Why don't I take over here
and you can join Roz?

18:39.185 --> 18:42.585
For the love of God.

18:42.785 --> 18:44.651
If I'd known you
would take my words seriously,

18:44.851 --> 18:46.451
I would've chosen them
more carefully.

18:46.585 --> 18:49.985
For God's sakes, get out of here.
Get down to that lake.

18:50.185 --> 18:52.185
Fellas, I really think
I should check on Alice.

18:52.318 --> 18:54.918
No, no, Roz, your baby is just fine.

18:55.118 --> 18:57.451
I burped her once
and she went out like a light.

18:57.585 --> 18:58.785
Come on. Let's go, Niles.

18:58.985 --> 19:00.851
Oh, you know,
I am thinking about it.

19:01.118 --> 19:04.785
I think it's much more romantic
to stay here by the fire

19:04.918 --> 19:05.985
than watch some sunset.

19:06.185 --> 19:09.118
Why don't you clear out
so we can have our privacy?

19:09.785 --> 19:12.851
Well, all right.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.318
On the other hand...

19:17.585 --> 19:19.985
You know, you can enjoy the fire
all night long.

19:20.251 --> 19:22.118
You've only got ten more minutes
for the sunset.

19:22.318 --> 19:23.851
You gonna get ammo
while it's daylight?

19:23.985 --> 19:27.185
- It's almost sunset.
- Don't tell me, tell them.

19:27.318 --> 19:28.651
- Is that the bathroom?
- No.

19:28.851 --> 19:30.985
- Yes, it is.
- It's out of order.

19:33.318 --> 19:35.185
Let me check again.

19:38.318 --> 19:41.651
My God. One of the pipes has burst
and the other one's knocking.

19:43.518 --> 19:45.651
Fine, is there one
down the hallway there?

19:45.851 --> 19:47.251
- No.
- Yes, there is.

19:47.451 --> 19:48.518
No, it's out of order too.

19:48.651 --> 19:51.651
Well, it's a good thing
I brought all that beer.

19:52.918 --> 19:55.318
You know, Niles,
you're behaving awfully strangely.

19:55.585 --> 19:57.518
- What the heck is going on?
- What do you mean?

19:57.651 --> 20:00.785
I mean that you show absolutely
no desire to be alone with Roz.

20:00.918 --> 20:03.785
Starting to have serious doubts
about this so-called romance.

20:03.985 --> 20:05.585
Oh, really?

20:05.785 --> 20:08.985
Well, does this look "so-called" to you?
Come here, pookie.

20:17.651 --> 20:21.251
That's why the door was stuck.
You two, why didn't you tell me?

20:21.518 --> 20:23.318
- Donny.
- Donny?

20:23.585 --> 20:25.118
Daphne.

20:26.118 --> 20:28.585
- Daphne.
- What are you doing here?

20:28.851 --> 20:30.651
Well, Niles invited me.

20:30.918 --> 20:32.251
Oh, did he?

20:32.318 --> 20:34.918
It was nice. Roz and I
had a chance to catch up on old times.

20:35.118 --> 20:37.251
Yeah, that's right.
You two used to date, didn't you?

20:37.518 --> 20:41.651
Well, isn't that nice of Niles
to organise this little reunion?

20:41.985 --> 20:43.651
I hope I don't have anything
to worry about.

20:43.851 --> 20:45.451
Oh, come on, are you kidding?

20:45.651 --> 20:48.851
Well, obviously, Roz and Niles can
barely keep their hands off each other.

20:50.318 --> 20:52.851
You know,
why don't all of us get out of here?

20:56.851 --> 20:59.918

21:11.118 --> 21:15.785

21:34.305 --> 21:40.802
