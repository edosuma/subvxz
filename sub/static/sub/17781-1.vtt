WEBVTT

00:01.376 --> 00:01.876
Music

02:49.795 --> 02:50.295
Music

03:30.210 --> 03:36.593
My name is Karl Glocken,
and this is a ship of fools.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.055
I'm a fool.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.936
And you'll meet more
fools as we go along.

03:40.095 --> 03:42.939
This tub is packed with them.

03:43.098 --> 03:49.526
Emancipated ladies, ballplayers,
lovers, dog lovers,

03:49.688 --> 03:57.072
ladies of joy, tolerant Jews,
Dwarfs, all kinds.

03:57.237 --> 04:00.707
And who knows, if you look
closely enough you may even

04:00.866 --> 04:04.871
find yourself on board.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.338
Good morning, doctor.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.798
Good morning.

04:21.678 --> 04:25.649
[horn blowing]

04:39.446 --> 04:41.039
Glad to get out of Veracruz.

04:41.198 --> 04:44.498
The whole damn
country is ready to explode.

04:44.659 --> 04:46.332
Well, did you
get a look at them?

04:46.495 --> 04:48.543
Anything interesting?

04:48.705 --> 04:51.174
Anything interesting at all?

04:51.333 --> 04:54.587
There's a dwarf, that high.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.548
A couple of young
American painters.

04:57.714 --> 05:01.719
And a Jewish salesman with
an infectious sense of humor.

05:01.885 --> 05:04.809
Women, Willie.
Women.

05:04.971 --> 05:09.226
Well, a rather attractive
middle-aged American woman.

05:09.392 --> 05:12.316
But I'm afraid she's too
far from the cradle for you.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.026
Those are the kind
that can appreciate

05:14.189 --> 05:16.237
what they are getting.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.822
There's a Spanish dancing
troupe, interesting,

05:18.985 --> 05:20.658
but maybe professional.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.324
They've had those Spanish
dance troupes on board before.

05:23.490 --> 05:26.118
And the usual
assortment of our countrywomen.

05:26.284 --> 05:27.877
Professors' wives?

05:28.036 --> 05:29.538
Saleswomen putting on airs?

05:29.704 --> 05:30.956
I'm afraid so.

05:31.122 --> 05:33.045
Governesses?

05:33.208 --> 05:34.334
Maybe you shouldn't.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.128
That's all right.

05:36.294 --> 05:38.672
You're really getting
off at Bremerhaven, huh?

05:38.839 --> 05:40.557
It wasn't a very long career.

05:40.715 --> 05:42.388
Three voyages.

05:42.551 --> 05:44.178
Long enough.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.893
I don't know what I'm
going to do without you.

05:47.055 --> 05:50.434
You'll manage.

05:50.600 --> 05:55.652
You want to know the
sentimental, disgusting truth?

05:56.648 --> 06:00.653
I've become fonder of you
than of most people in my life.

06:02.404 --> 06:06.580
We just got used to
each other, that's all.

06:06.741 --> 06:08.743
Who am I to play chess with?

06:08.910 --> 06:10.583
Who am I to talk to?

06:10.745 --> 06:14.295
You've seen the kind of
characters we get on this ship.

06:14.457 --> 06:16.177
I get a cold shudder
every time I have to go

06:16.209 --> 06:19.133
to the captain's table.

06:19.296 --> 06:22.596
I must be in my dotage.

06:22.757 --> 06:26.182
After my...

06:28.388 --> 06:30.265
I was looking for something.

06:30.432 --> 06:31.993
I thought I could
learn something new by

06:32.142 --> 06:34.941
being a ship's doctor.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.571
But I've seen all this before.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.529
I've seen all
these people before.

06:39.691 --> 06:42.365
Never on a ship, that's all.

06:42.527 --> 06:44.154
[knocking at door] Come in.

06:44.321 --> 06:45.618
Lunch is served, captain.

06:45.780 --> 06:48.533
Thank you.

06:49.618 --> 06:52.371
Please?

06:55.790 --> 06:57.884
What should I
tell them this time?

06:58.043 --> 07:00.637
Tell them anything you like.

07:00.795 --> 07:03.765
Tell them I had
to fix the toilets.

07:07.802 --> 07:08.302
Music

07:19.356 --> 07:20.983
1933 will be a good year.

07:21.149 --> 07:22.571
I am optimistic.

07:22.734 --> 07:25.578
At any rate, it is
starting out most auspiciously.

07:25.737 --> 07:27.535
It is good to be
on a German boat

07:27.697 --> 07:29.665
with German people, going home.

07:29.824 --> 07:32.202
Say what you will,
there is a feeling when

07:32.369 --> 07:33.837
German people get together.

07:33.995 --> 07:35.372
I cannot explain it.

07:35.538 --> 07:38.542
Gemntliche Kameraderie which
exists among no other people.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.756
At least I have
found it nowhere else.

07:40.919 --> 07:42.512
You know what
they say in Mexico?

07:42.671 --> 07:45.299
Mexicans loathe the
Americans, hate the Spaniards,

07:45.465 --> 07:47.809
distrust the English,
admire the French

07:47.968 --> 07:49.686
and love the Germans.

07:49.844 --> 07:51.061
That is very nice.

07:51.221 --> 07:52.564
I am glad they
say those things.

07:52.722 --> 07:55.475
But as far as I am
concerned, after a few weeks in

07:55.642 --> 07:59.237
Mexico you can keep
the Mexicans too.

07:59.396 --> 08:01.273
How long has it been
since you have been home,

08:01.439 --> 08:03.362
Herr Freytag?

08:03.525 --> 08:04.822
Four months.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.578
You must be glad
to be going home too.

08:06.736 --> 08:08.830
Yes, my wife is there.

08:08.989 --> 08:11.367
Why is it every
charming man I meet is married?

08:11.533 --> 08:14.457
Fraulein Spockenkieker, you
have wounded to me the quick.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.121
Excepting you, Herr Rieber.

08:16.287 --> 08:19.666
I'm sorry.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.382
That little dog is so sweet.

08:22.544 --> 08:25.263
He has shared so much of
the professor's life and mine

08:25.422 --> 08:29.097
I feel sometimes he
is like our son.

08:29.259 --> 08:34.265
Do you think it's correct
to bring a dog to the table?

08:35.222 --> 08:37.692
Bebe goes with us everywhere.

08:37.851 --> 08:43.028
We have taken him to
some of the best restaurants.

08:43.188 --> 08:46.284
Nobody seems to mind.

08:49.237 --> 08:53.117
You know, it's gonna be
a wonderful trip, David.

08:53.908 --> 08:56.582
I still feel funny
about you picking up the tab.

08:56.745 --> 09:00.966
Look, we weren't
gonna talk about that.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.924
Did I ever tell you
these have been the best

09:06.087 --> 09:08.886
3 months of my life?

09:09.049 --> 09:10.892
Did I ever tell you that
I care for you so much

09:11.051 --> 09:14.055
it's very upsetting?

09:17.724 --> 09:20.728
What?
What's the matter?

09:20.894 --> 09:26.572
Twenty six days
in separate beds.

09:26.733 --> 09:29.907
It's probably a
very good thing.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.869
We'll get to know each other.

09:33.031 --> 09:34.874
We'll find out whether
we have anything going

09:35.033 --> 09:38.708
for us besides sex.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.630
I'll give you one more time
to hang yourself.

09:40.789 --> 09:42.166
I know you got more
money from the Swede.

09:42.332 --> 09:43.584
Gave you what I got.

09:43.750 --> 09:44.842
Barman told me different.

09:45.001 --> 09:46.048
He is a liar.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.555
If you're holding out,
I'll rip your lying tongue out.

09:48.713 --> 09:50.681
Rip my guts out.
I don't have any more money.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.013
- Que pasa?
- Que pasa?

09:53.176 --> 09:55.895
[Speaking Spanish]

10:00.350 --> 10:02.068
I asked for a table alone.

10:02.227 --> 10:05.652
I'm sorry, madame, there
is no room for a table alone.

10:11.194 --> 10:14.243
Please don't bother getting up.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.583
You're an American?

10:20.745 --> 10:22.793
My name's Bill Tenny.

10:22.956 --> 10:25.300
Mary Treadwell.

10:25.458 --> 10:28.086
Yes, madam?

10:28.253 --> 10:34.386
I'll have the Pate and the
Rheinischer Sauerbraten.

10:35.093 --> 10:36.185
You, sir?

10:36.344 --> 10:37.266
You got a steak?

10:37.428 --> 10:38.350
Yes, sir.

10:38.513 --> 10:39.389
Thick?

10:39.556 --> 10:42.935
We will do our best.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.317
I'd better stick
to the simple stuff.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.959
I was in Veracruz
trying to teach them

10:48.022 --> 10:49.399
greasers to play ball.

10:49.566 --> 10:51.284
Man, they tried to poison me.

10:51.442 --> 10:54.286
You know, I had the
runs for three weeks.

10:55.071 --> 10:57.494
How interesting.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.877
I'd like to hear more about it.

11:02.662 --> 11:06.166
Herr Rieber, I hear that
you publish a national magazine

11:06.332 --> 11:09.006
with certain
intellectual features.

11:09.169 --> 11:12.139
A garment trade
magazine, but modern.

11:12.297 --> 11:13.469
Modern.

11:13.631 --> 11:14.757
Good afternoon.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.267
I'm Willie Schumann,
the ship's doctor.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.178
The captain sends his regrets.

11:18.344 --> 11:19.721
He's unable to come to lunch

11:19.888 --> 11:21.356
because of ship's business.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.312
Doctor, I am Siegfried Rieber.

11:23.474 --> 11:25.101
This is Professor Hutten,
Frau Hutten.

11:25.268 --> 11:26.485
Please.

11:26.644 --> 11:27.736
No, no allow me.

11:27.896 --> 11:28.943
Their dog, Bebe.

11:29.105 --> 11:31.358
This charming young lady
is Fraulein Spockenkieker.

11:31.524 --> 11:34.403
Herr Freytag, Frau
Schmitt, Herr Graf

11:34.569 --> 11:35.741
and his nephew Johann.

11:35.904 --> 11:37.372
Don't let me
interrupt your conversations.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.658
We were just discussing
Herr Rieber's magazine.

11:39.824 --> 11:43.044
I have invited writers
from all over the nation to

11:43.203 --> 11:47.083
contribute on one topic: How we
can expunge foreign influences

11:47.248 --> 11:49.967
and restore Germany to
its national greatness.

11:50.126 --> 11:53.801
What foreign influences?

12:03.556 --> 12:05.854
If you need any attendance,
I'll be at your disposal.

12:06.017 --> 12:07.485
Thank you.

12:07.644 --> 12:12.445
On my part, doctor, you
need have no concern for me.

12:12.607 --> 12:16.111
I do not believe
in materia medica.

12:16.277 --> 12:18.075
Really?

12:18.238 --> 12:21.538
Have you found
something better to replace it?

12:21.699 --> 12:23.121
Faith.

12:23.284 --> 12:25.002
Faith. I see.
Well, well.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.504
A toast.

12:26.663 --> 12:28.757
A toast to the German
woman, the most beautiful

12:28.915 --> 12:31.464
in the world.

12:35.296 --> 12:37.014
Delicious.

12:37.173 --> 12:39.426
Herr Rieber.

12:48.017 --> 12:50.361
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

12:50.520 --> 12:51.897
Karl Glocken.

12:52.063 --> 12:54.566
Julius Lowenthal.

12:55.525 --> 12:58.654
The herring is very good.

12:58.820 --> 13:01.949
I'll have that and a
couple of hard-boiled eggs.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.500
I beg your pardon.

13:08.663 --> 13:10.961
You aren't Jewish, are you?

13:12.125 --> 13:15.595
No, I have my
own minority group.

13:15.753 --> 13:18.051
They usually give a Jew
a table of his own

13:18.214 --> 13:20.012
on a boat like this.

13:20.174 --> 13:22.472
Why do you think
they put us together?

13:22.635 --> 13:24.228
It's their way
of being friendly.

13:24.387 --> 13:27.106
Perhaps they
thought we might hit it off.

13:35.148 --> 13:39.574
You are sure
you are not Jewish?

13:40.153 --> 13:42.247
Reasonably sure.

13:42.405 --> 13:45.875
You resemble a brother-in-law
of mine in Stuttgart.

13:46.034 --> 13:47.411
That's the way it is.

13:47.577 --> 13:50.296
People are always
mistaking me for someone else.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.508
Spot of wine?

13:53.666 --> 13:56.089
Just a touch.

13:56.252 --> 14:00.348
[horn blowing]

14:27.450 --> 14:30.545
My God, where are
we going to put them?

14:30.703 --> 14:33.877
We'll have to manage.

15:02.652 --> 15:05.030
Professor, what is it?

15:05.196 --> 15:06.743
What's happening?

15:06.906 --> 15:08.658
Who are all those people?

15:08.825 --> 15:10.305
There's nothing to
be concerned about.

15:10.326 --> 15:13.546
I have spoken to
one of the officials.

15:13.704 --> 15:15.206
But what is it?

15:15.373 --> 15:18.593
It has to do with the price
of sugar on the world market.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.048
Sugar?

15:20.211 --> 15:21.337
Yeah.

15:21.504 --> 15:22.972
You see, the sugar planters
have been unable to get their

15:23.131 --> 15:25.725
price so they burned their
crops in the fields rather than

15:25.883 --> 15:28.261
let the prices go down.

15:28.428 --> 15:32.183
Something had to be done
about the Spanish laborers so

15:32.348 --> 15:35.898
the Cuban government hit upon
a humanitarian plan of action.

15:36.060 --> 15:38.859
They're sending them home.

15:40.690 --> 15:46.038
[shouting]

16:32.783 --> 16:33.283
Music

17:04.106 --> 17:06.325
- How do you feel?
- Bien.

17:06.483 --> 17:09.032
Good.

17:09.819 --> 17:12.573
I come to see you later, yes?

17:13.241 --> 17:15.618
Please put her
there in the corner.

17:29.632 --> 17:31.179
Where can they wash?

17:31.342 --> 17:32.594
There are two spigots.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.012
What?!

17:34.178 --> 17:35.395
It is not my fault.

17:35.555 --> 17:38.024
Stop talking to me in this way.

17:38.182 --> 17:39.980
You don't put 600 people
on a deck with only

17:40.142 --> 17:41.894
two outlets to wash!

17:42.061 --> 17:43.859
They wouldn't
wash if they could.

17:44.021 --> 17:45.739
You don't know
what pigs they are.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.445
The deck has to be cleaned.
Bring the hoses.

17:47.608 --> 17:48.700
The hoses?

17:48.859 --> 17:49.860
Bring the hoses out!

17:50.027 --> 17:51.148
I cannot turn hoses on them.

17:51.237 --> 17:52.614
It's better to turn the
hoses on them than for them to

17:52.780 --> 17:55.374
live this way, no?

17:56.701 --> 17:58.453
Break out the hoses.

17:58.619 --> 18:00.667
Turn on those hoses.

18:01.581 --> 18:02.261
[shouting]

19:17.156 --> 19:19.579
I take it you are not
exactly pleased that we are

19:19.742 --> 19:22.370
cabin mates on this voyage.

19:22.536 --> 19:25.540
I have already requested a
change in the accommodations.

19:25.706 --> 19:28.255
Take it from me, I'm
not exactly overwhelmed

19:28.417 --> 19:30.294
with the prospect either.

19:30.461 --> 19:33.840
However, pending changes
since we are captives of each

19:34.006 --> 19:37.351
other's company for 26 days,
I think it is best

19:37.510 --> 19:40.639
if we reach an understanding.

19:41.305 --> 19:43.307
Our cosmetics, for instance.

19:43.474 --> 19:47.945
I will keep mine on
this side of the sink.

19:48.104 --> 19:51.233
And you keep
yours on that side.

19:51.399 --> 19:53.743
That's right?

19:53.901 --> 19:59.658
Which bunk do you
prefer, the lower or the upper?

19:59.824 --> 20:02.327
I was assured the lower.

20:02.493 --> 20:04.996
It is yours.

20:05.162 --> 20:06.755
What are your habits?

20:06.914 --> 20:09.963
I, myself, rise very
early in the morning.

20:10.126 --> 20:13.255
I take it that if this
evening is an example,

20:13.421 --> 20:15.719
you are a late bird.

20:15.881 --> 20:20.603
If you sleep late, I will
see that I do not disturb you.

20:21.470 --> 20:24.724
And I hope you, in
turn, will try your best

20:24.890 --> 20:27.564
not to disturb me.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.738
One other thing.

20:38.112 --> 20:40.956
One other thing.

20:41.115 --> 20:44.244
My wife has informed me
in the most sarcastic terms

20:44.410 --> 20:48.005
possible I snore.

20:50.332 --> 20:52.505
Good night.

20:52.668 --> 20:53.920
You a painter, huh?

20:54.086 --> 20:55.087
Yeah.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.414
What was you doing in Mexico?

20:56.464 --> 20:57.636
I was a timekeeper in a mine.

20:57.798 --> 20:59.015
I thought you
said you was a painter.

20:59.175 --> 21:01.052
I am a painter,
but I was a timekeeper.

21:01.218 --> 21:02.936
Why?

21:03.095 --> 21:05.223
To support myself as a painter.

21:05.389 --> 21:06.710
Don't you make
any money painting?

21:06.849 --> 21:07.941
No.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.352
Now, wait a minute.
Come on.

21:09.518 --> 21:10.690
Wait a minute.

21:10.853 --> 21:13.231
You mean to tell me you work
at something you can't make

21:13.397 --> 21:16.367
a living off so you gotta take
a job to make enough money

21:16.525 --> 21:19.199
to go on working at work
you can't live on?

21:19.361 --> 21:21.034
But that is the heroic life.

21:21.197 --> 21:23.700
That is the way men
who trust themselves

21:23.866 --> 21:26.369
can afford to live.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.082
A strange neck of the woods.

21:28.245 --> 21:29.462
What do you mean?

21:29.622 --> 21:31.044
Strange neck of the woods.

21:31.207 --> 21:34.131
Look, I run into all
kinds of people, you know, but.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.216
Did I tell you what
happened in Veracruz

21:36.378 --> 21:38.096
coming through immigration?

21:38.255 --> 21:39.598
I'm standing in line.

21:39.757 --> 21:41.600
I see this clerk and
I holler, "Hey, Pancho!

21:41.759 --> 21:43.136
Get over here!"

21:43.302 --> 21:45.555
Just being friendly-like
like back home you call a taxi

21:45.721 --> 21:48.019
driver Mac or a
Pullman porter George.

21:48.182 --> 21:49.934
This little Negro... now, you
know these coast Mexicans

21:50.100 --> 21:52.102
got mostly Negro
blood in 'em, I'm told.

21:52.269 --> 21:54.397
Well, he just looks
up and stares at me.

21:54.563 --> 21:57.362
The next thing I know,
everybody's going ahead of me

21:57.525 --> 21:59.118
in this line.

21:59.276 --> 22:03.782
Then I realize that this
little Negro resented it.

22:04.782 --> 22:06.705
I think I'll turn in.

22:06.867 --> 22:08.995
Me too.

22:15.209 --> 22:20.841
[knocking at door] Come in.

22:23.092 --> 22:27.472
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

22:27.638 --> 22:29.732
I'm the doctor.
You wanted to see me?

22:29.890 --> 22:33.394
Yes. I need something
to help me sleep.

22:33.561 --> 22:34.904
Are you ill?

22:35.062 --> 22:36.188
No, no.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.153
I just want
something to help me sleep.

22:38.315 --> 22:39.862
Do you often
have trouble sleeping?

22:40.025 --> 22:42.027
Yes. Always.

22:42.945 --> 22:44.413
Does your doctor
help you to sleep?

22:44.572 --> 22:45.824
Yes.

22:45.990 --> 22:47.242
Occasionally.

22:47.408 --> 22:48.876
Take off your robe.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.877
You're sure
you're the ship's doctor?

22:51.036 --> 22:53.505
I am the ship's doctor.

23:01.463 --> 23:03.886
Lean forward, please.

23:07.219 --> 23:08.846
What is it?

23:09.013 --> 23:10.310
Your hands are cold.

23:10.472 --> 23:12.895
I'm sorry.

23:17.646 --> 23:20.365
Breathe deeply.

23:26.030 --> 23:28.499
When was your period?

23:28.657 --> 23:32.002
- Look, is it necessary to...
- Yes, it is necessary.

23:32.161 --> 23:33.378
All right.

23:33.537 --> 23:35.790
Last week.

23:35.956 --> 23:38.800
I'm sure you'd never
have any trouble sleeping.

23:38.959 --> 23:41.257
No, never.

23:41.420 --> 23:44.173
Tell me your secret.

23:47.009 --> 23:50.263
A clear conscience, of course.

23:50.888 --> 23:52.731
That's a neat trick, having
a clear conscience when you're

23:52.890 --> 23:56.485
a doctor on a ship which
has 600 people living

23:56.644 --> 23:59.113
on an open deck.

23:59.271 --> 24:02.275
You can't take pills every
time you can't sleep or anytime

24:02.441 --> 24:04.443
you want to be
stimulated or sedated.

24:04.610 --> 24:06.988
It has its effect.

24:07.988 --> 24:10.366
What are you laughing at?

24:11.784 --> 24:14.082
My house has been burned.

24:14.244 --> 24:16.713
They've taken everything I had.

24:16.872 --> 24:19.375
Now I'm being taken
to prison, to an island

24:19.541 --> 24:21.760
I know nothing about.

24:21.919 --> 24:25.514
And you're giving me
a Sunday school sermon.

24:27.383 --> 24:30.011
You can put your
robe back on now.

24:30.177 --> 24:32.396
Thank you.

24:35.432 --> 24:38.481
You're a gentle touch.

24:38.644 --> 24:41.523
Maybe you're not as
stuffy as you pretend to be.

24:42.022 --> 24:43.990
No. I hope not.

24:48.278 --> 24:50.827
You gonna help me?

24:51.865 --> 24:55.119
Your doctor may have
helped you too often.

24:56.620 --> 25:00.124
I'm very helpless
at this moment.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.719
You can leave me
without any help.

25:03.877 --> 25:06.380
That's your prerogative.

25:18.267 --> 25:20.861
This is for tonight only.

25:24.023 --> 25:25.149
How old are you?

25:25.315 --> 25:27.363
I'm old enough, as you can see.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.574
Much too old.

25:29.737 --> 25:31.284
Forty five?

25:31.447 --> 25:33.575
Not that old.

25:34.116 --> 25:35.618
How old are you?

25:35.784 --> 25:38.378
Forty two.

25:40.247 --> 25:41.749
How old are you?

25:41.915 --> 25:43.417
Forty one.

25:43.584 --> 25:44.756
You're joking.

25:44.918 --> 25:47.512
Thank you.

25:52.968 --> 25:55.562
Lie back, please.

25:58.849 --> 26:01.102
You will feel it in a moment.

26:01.268 --> 26:02.611
Yes.

26:02.770 --> 26:04.113
Talk.

26:04.271 --> 26:05.443
I beg your pardon?

26:05.606 --> 26:08.325
Talk until the
drug takes effect.

26:13.322 --> 26:16.496
This boat smells of cabbage.

26:17.701 --> 26:22.081
Why does every German
boat smell of cabbage?

26:22.247 --> 26:24.500
Keep talking.

26:24.666 --> 26:27.385
What do you want
me to talk about?

26:27.920 --> 26:31.424
Anything you like, just talk.

26:34.802 --> 26:36.725
What's your name?

26:36.887 --> 26:38.355
Schumann.

26:38.514 --> 26:41.563
No, your first name.

26:41.725 --> 26:43.853
Wilhelm.

26:46.939 --> 26:49.738
Wilhelm.

26:50.818 --> 26:54.118
Wilhelm.

26:54.988 --> 26:57.992
It's perfect.

27:01.370 --> 27:04.419
Perfect.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.067
Have you made this trip before?

27:24.226 --> 27:26.775
I make it at
least twice a year.

27:26.937 --> 27:28.439
Are you in some
sort of business?

27:28.605 --> 27:29.857
I'm in the jewelry business.

27:30.023 --> 27:31.525
A special part.

27:31.692 --> 27:32.944
I sell religious trinkets.

27:33.110 --> 27:34.362
Any religion.

27:34.528 --> 27:36.371
You name it, I got it.

27:36.530 --> 27:39.534
I sell neck
chains, bracelets, anklets.

27:39.700 --> 27:41.168
It sounds like good business.

27:41.326 --> 27:42.794
It's a very good business.

27:42.953 --> 27:45.422
People feel better
when they wear these things.

27:45.581 --> 27:47.174
I feel good too.

27:47.332 --> 27:49.505
With all this stuff on me,
I feel like an African

27:49.668 --> 27:51.045
I met in Paris.

27:51.211 --> 27:54.431
He bought from me a
crucifix, Buddha and mezuzah.

27:54.590 --> 27:56.342
All on one chain.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.385
Do you know what he said?

27:58.552 --> 28:03.058
He said, It may not
help, but it can't hurt.

28:03.223 --> 28:05.396
You seem to get along
very well with people.

28:05.559 --> 28:07.027
I like people.

28:07.186 --> 28:10.531
If you look for it, you can
find something good in anybody.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.191
It must be difficult sometimes.

28:12.357 --> 28:16.328
For instance, doesn't it
bother you that you and that

28:16.486 --> 28:18.534
little man are the only
two Germans who aren't

28:18.697 --> 28:21.871
at the captain's table?

28:23.410 --> 28:26.004
Do you think that bothers me?

28:26.163 --> 28:28.632
Besides, I like
that little man.

28:28.790 --> 28:31.339
What kind of a salesman
do you think I would be if I

28:31.501 --> 28:35.005
couldn't deal with a
situation like that?

28:35.172 --> 28:38.176
A salesman is supposed to
deal with a difficult situation

28:38.342 --> 28:40.595
and overcome it.

28:40.761 --> 28:43.105
Listen, it's not a new story.

28:43.263 --> 28:46.312
White men hate black men.
Muslims hate Buddhists.

28:46.475 --> 28:47.977
That's the way it goes.

28:48.143 --> 28:49.986
There's prejudice everywhere.

28:50.145 --> 28:52.944
It does no good
to give it back.

28:53.106 --> 28:56.280
You have got to
use your noodle.

29:15.087 --> 29:17.385
You must not mind
not winning against me.

29:17.547 --> 29:19.470
After all, I was Ping-Pong
champion of the Sportsverein

29:19.633 --> 29:21.385
in Frankfurt, three times over.

29:21.551 --> 29:23.144
- Morning.
- Morning.

29:23.303 --> 29:25.977
Morning.

29:26.556 --> 29:28.117
Herr Freytag picks
some bizarre company.

29:28.267 --> 29:30.315
I suspect they are
birds of a feather.

29:30.477 --> 29:31.820
Well, shall we play again?

29:31.979 --> 29:33.947
Or perhaps I might
suggest another game.

29:34.106 --> 29:35.198
What game?

29:35.357 --> 29:36.358
Any game.

29:36.525 --> 29:37.526
One which you might win.

29:37.693 --> 29:38.785
What game do you mean?

29:38.944 --> 29:39.991
You have no idea'?

29:40.153 --> 29:42.906
I will not let you
talk that way to me.

29:43.073 --> 29:44.245
I'm sorry.

29:44.408 --> 29:45.455
How dare you!

29:45.617 --> 29:46.834
I could not resist.

29:46.994 --> 29:49.747
I couldn't resist either.

29:52.082 --> 29:54.176
What do your parents feel
about you going to Europe?

29:54.334 --> 29:55.586
Mother's thrilled.

29:55.752 --> 29:57.174
It's something
she's always wanted to do.

29:57.337 --> 30:00.511
I think my father gave me
up for lost a long time ago.

30:01.258 --> 30:02.885
What do your parents do?

30:03.051 --> 30:05.349
My father owns a store.

30:06.179 --> 30:08.773
It's a good store,
a furniture store.

30:08.932 --> 30:11.776
My mother's never
been satisfied with it.

30:11.935 --> 30:15.030
She taught me that a woman
had to have something outside

30:15.188 --> 30:17.691
of her husband, otherwise it
was bridge games and one day

30:17.858 --> 30:20.281
a week at the hospital.

30:20.986 --> 30:23.080
What about that young
man you're traveling with?

30:23.238 --> 30:24.535
David.

30:24.698 --> 30:27.622
David's an artist.
A wonderful one.

30:27.784 --> 30:30.253
He's a bit caught up with
social consciousness right now

30:30.412 --> 30:32.460
but he'll get over that.

30:32.622 --> 30:34.875
Is it serious?

30:35.042 --> 30:39.923
I never felt about anybody
the way I do about David.

30:40.088 --> 30:42.716
I think that David thinks a
woman should follow three paces

30:42.883 --> 30:45.978
behind with slippers.

30:46.136 --> 30:48.138
Men usually do.

30:48.305 --> 30:49.898
My husband certainly did.

30:50.057 --> 30:52.105
No, thank you.
I have a whiskey sour.

30:52.267 --> 30:53.564
What did your husband do?

30:53.727 --> 30:55.900
He was in the diplomatic corps.

30:56.063 --> 30:58.691
We put up a
wonderful front in public.

30:58.857 --> 31:02.031
We were
everybody's favorite couple.

31:02.194 --> 31:05.915
In private, it was
something else again.

31:06.073 --> 31:08.417
He was jealous of me.

31:08.575 --> 31:11.374
He was so jealous
of me that he hit me.

31:11.536 --> 31:15.211
He hit me until
I bled at the nose.

31:15.374 --> 31:19.174
I was wondering
whether David would beat me.

31:19.336 --> 31:21.930
We quarrel sometimes.

31:22.089 --> 31:25.184
It seems to come out of
nothing then it grows into such

31:25.342 --> 31:26.685
ugliness and bitterness.

31:26.843 --> 31:29.767
It surprises both of us.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.349
I guess a relationship
between a man and a woman

31:32.516 --> 31:35.440
is very difficult these days.

31:36.353 --> 31:38.981
Practically impossible.

31:43.735 --> 31:50.038
Put on your beret, Carlos.

31:50.200 --> 31:53.579
[shouting]

31:53.745 --> 31:56.043
Now we can hang in The Prado.

31:56.206 --> 31:57.753
We will hang somewhere, Carlos.

31:57.916 --> 32:00.840
The place is uncertain.

32:03.547 --> 32:05.766
That's enough
for today, thank you.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.473
Anytime.

32:21.064 --> 32:23.943
I just can't tell you
how much I admire you.

32:24.109 --> 32:25.736
Why?

32:25.902 --> 32:27.575
You create.

32:27.737 --> 32:29.364
I'm not even sure about that.

32:29.531 --> 32:32.330
I've never been given
a penny for any of this.

32:32.492 --> 32:34.085
Still, I envy you.

32:34.244 --> 32:36.167
I envy you your struggle.

32:36.329 --> 32:39.708
I envy you your doubts
and flounderings, even.

32:39.875 --> 32:43.675
And Fraulein Brown.
I envy you that too.

32:44.504 --> 32:46.882
She's an attractive girl,
isn't she?

32:47.048 --> 32:49.676
Are you two
going to be married?

32:55.307 --> 32:59.312
I am sorry.
I don't mean to pry.

33:00.061 --> 33:02.109
You know, the
distasteful curiosity

33:02.272 --> 33:05.776
of the non-participant.

33:06.610 --> 33:08.032
That's all right.

33:08.195 --> 33:10.075
I don't honestly know
whether we'll get married.

33:10.197 --> 33:12.950
I told you how
uncertain my life is.

33:13.116 --> 33:15.210
I need all the help I can get.

33:15.368 --> 33:17.416
I need someone who can
believe in a man who hasn't

33:17.579 --> 33:19.206
proved himself yet.

33:19.372 --> 33:20.999
Someone to be there.

33:21.166 --> 33:22.292
Be for me.

33:22.459 --> 33:25.087
Couldn't
Fraulein Brown be that?

33:25.253 --> 33:27.130
Fraulein Brown
is a modern woman.

33:27.297 --> 33:29.220
Their needs are a
lot more complicated

33:29.382 --> 33:32.977
than our mothers' were.

33:33.136 --> 33:35.889
I'm crazy about Jenny.
I really am.

33:36.056 --> 33:38.229
I never felt this way
about anybody, the way

33:38.391 --> 33:40.393
I feel about her.

33:40.560 --> 33:43.609
I'm afraid to find out
how apart we really might be.

33:43.772 --> 33:46.571
I see.

33:47.359 --> 33:51.910
I suppose one of the saddest
things in the world must be to

33:52.072 --> 33:56.623
see two people who feel so much
for each other and who feel

33:56.785 --> 34:00.631
that they belong together, and
yet they really don't belong

34:00.789 --> 34:03.963
together at all.

34:18.598 --> 34:19.940
- Hello.
- Hello.

34:20.100 --> 34:22.319
What are you doing?

34:22.476 --> 34:25.230
I'm making one of these.

34:29.317 --> 34:31.239
How many of these do you have?

34:31.402 --> 34:34.077
Many.-

34:35.657 --> 34:38.409
Here is a bull.

34:38.577 --> 34:41.797
A dog.

34:47.460 --> 34:50.054
Do you think anyone in first
class would be interested

34:50.213 --> 34:52.011
to buy them?

34:52.172 --> 34:54.801
I would.

35:10.483 --> 35:12.656
Good morning.

35:13.570 --> 35:15.743
Good morning.

35:15.905 --> 35:17.578
How long have you been here?

35:17.741 --> 35:19.835
About a half an hour.

35:19.993 --> 35:21.620
No, no, don't get up.

35:21.786 --> 35:23.129
Lie back.

35:23.288 --> 35:24.881
Did you put this over me?

35:25.040 --> 35:26.917
Of course.

35:27.083 --> 35:29.882
I'm glad to see
you are on deck.

35:31.046 --> 35:34.175
It was a wonderful drug
you gave me, whatever it was.

35:34.341 --> 35:37.311
What was it, incidentally?

35:38.386 --> 35:41.686
You don't expect me
to tell you, do you?

35:41.848 --> 35:44.226
You can actually laugh.

35:44.392 --> 35:47.066
Did I startle you very much?

35:47.896 --> 35:51.025
It's good to
hear you laugh too.

35:51.608 --> 35:54.703
Did you ever have all the
worst possible things that can

35:54.861 --> 35:57.330
happen to you happen?

35:57.489 --> 36:01.289
Well, it gives you the
most irresponsible feeling.

36:01.451 --> 36:03.249
Nothing more can happen.

36:03.411 --> 36:06.130
[glass shattering]

36:10.293 --> 36:12.546
Hey!

36:12.712 --> 36:14.931
Are you all right?

36:16.257 --> 36:17.897
It takes a great deal
of courage to tangle

36:17.967 --> 36:20.345
with those two.

36:20.512 --> 36:22.981
I have a certain
security with them.

36:23.139 --> 36:26.484
They are the only characters
on the boat smaller than I am.

36:27.894 --> 36:31.398
Such a charming lady
makes a charming morning

36:31.564 --> 36:33.237
even more charming.

36:33.400 --> 36:35.949
Thank you.

36:38.238 --> 36:40.240
He's wonderful.

36:40.407 --> 36:42.205
He certainly is.

36:42.367 --> 36:45.416
The one thing about these
children they seem to have

36:45.578 --> 36:48.752
a better time than
anyone on the boat.

36:48.915 --> 36:51.668
If you expect me to
defend those two monsters,

36:51.835 --> 36:53.257
you're much mistaken.

36:53.420 --> 36:55.013
My prescription for them
is to throw them overboard

36:55.171 --> 36:57.640
in a leaky lifeboat.

36:57.799 --> 37:00.177
You didn't have
a childhood at all?

37:00.343 --> 37:01.811
Nothing like theirs.

37:01.970 --> 37:03.722
At least, I hope not.

37:03.888 --> 37:07.609
When I was 4, I persuaded
my little brother

37:07.767 --> 37:09.314
to drink lye water.

37:09.477 --> 37:10.774
Lye water?

37:10.937 --> 37:12.439
Yeah, I told him it was milk.

37:12.605 --> 37:14.778
So he went to
screaming about the house.

37:14.941 --> 37:16.739
His mouth was scrubbed out.

37:16.901 --> 37:18.869
I was beaten black and blue.

37:19.028 --> 37:20.826
I meant him no harm.

37:20.989 --> 37:25.620
I was only curious to
know whether it would kill him.

37:26.411 --> 37:28.413
And what about your childhood?

37:28.580 --> 37:32.130
Did nothing gay ever
happen to you at all?

37:32.292 --> 37:36.217
No, I was the perfect dupe.

37:36.379 --> 37:39.053
I believed anything
anybody ever told me.

37:39.215 --> 37:41.013
I was full of the highest hopes

37:41.176 --> 37:44.806
and the most
unbelievable innocence.

37:44.971 --> 37:48.350
It's true, at the age of 12,
I did have an experience with

37:48.516 --> 37:51.941
the housekeeper that left an
indelible impression on me

37:52.103 --> 37:55.403
shocked my mother no end and
cost the poor girl her job.

37:55.565 --> 38:00.992
Well, there is
hope for you after all.

38:01.154 --> 38:04.283
The toreros are
having a fiesta tonight.

38:04.449 --> 38:05.792
I know.

38:05.950 --> 38:07.167
Are you coming?

38:07.327 --> 38:08.624
I wasn't planning to.

38:08.787 --> 38:12.166
I thought we might
have a dance if you did.

38:12.999 --> 38:15.718
Of course, you
probably don't dance.

38:15.877 --> 38:18.300
Exactly how dull
do you think I am?

38:18.463 --> 38:20.716
You are dull.

38:20.882 --> 38:25.558
You're dull, stolid,
unimaginative

38:25.720 --> 38:29.520
helpless and charming.

38:31.476 --> 38:34.400
Yes, charming.

38:37.732 --> 38:40.110
You're blushing.

38:40.276 --> 38:42.074
That's the most charming
thing I've ever seen

38:42.237 --> 38:44.456
in my whole life.

38:44.614 --> 38:47.743
I've never seen
a man blush before.

38:48.535 --> 38:50.208
I'm not blushing.

38:50.370 --> 38:53.214
I must have a temperature.

38:54.165 --> 39:00.218
Anyway, I'll wear my only
dress and I'll give you the

39:00.380 --> 39:03.759
choice of any dance you like.

39:03.925 --> 39:07.850
And I have a feeling
it's gonna be a slow waltz.

39:08.012 --> 39:11.391
I happen to excel
in the flamenco.

39:13.142 --> 39:14.940
I was an intellectual.

39:15.103 --> 39:17.856
I was a philosopher
and teacher of philosophy.

39:18.022 --> 39:21.242
Until three years ago, I
learned I was going to die.

39:21.401 --> 39:25.201
Then my wisdom dropped
from me like soiled rags.

39:25.363 --> 39:28.116
I was naked as
the day I was born.

39:28.283 --> 39:29.830
I heard a voice.

39:29.993 --> 39:32.121
The most loving
voice I've ever heard.

39:32.287 --> 39:33.709
The voice of God!

39:33.872 --> 39:35.590
And God said to me...

39:35.748 --> 39:37.750
God speaks to him.

39:37.917 --> 39:40.136
He speaks to him personally.

39:40.295 --> 39:41.638
Be quiet, Gregorio!

39:41.796 --> 39:42.968
Don't spit on everything.

39:43.131 --> 39:45.930
I asked myself,
why was I afraid?

39:46.092 --> 39:49.722
What are my personal
sufferings but a divine grace

39:49.888 --> 39:52.437
that can be made
useful to others'?

39:52.599 --> 39:53.771
The miracle is...

39:53.933 --> 39:55.935
Miracle?
What miracle?

39:56.102 --> 39:58.025
Can you make us a miracle?

39:58.187 --> 40:00.440
Can you get us out of this
slop, into the upper decks,

40:00.607 --> 40:02.075
where we can breathe?

40:02.233 --> 40:03.735
That is a miracle.

40:03.902 --> 40:05.154
You blasphemous pig!

40:05.320 --> 40:07.197
You are the pig.
We are all pigs.

40:07.363 --> 40:09.786
Look at the way we live!

40:09.949 --> 40:12.418
Listen!
Listen to me!

40:12.577 --> 40:14.250
God's mercy is in...

40:14.412 --> 40:15.789
God?

40:15.955 --> 40:18.299
There is no God down here!

40:18.458 --> 40:22.088
Do you know what I
would do if God were here?

40:22.253 --> 40:25.223
I would curse him to his face.

40:25.381 --> 40:28.180
I would spit in his face!

40:28.343 --> 40:30.892
I would send him
down into his own hell!

40:31.054 --> 40:32.727
Get him out of here!

40:32.889 --> 40:34.015
Yeah!

40:34.182 --> 40:39.154
[shouting]

40:52.200 --> 40:57.673
[alarm ringing]

41:11.719 --> 41:12.845
The hoses.

41:13.012 --> 41:14.389
And give them more
than a bath this time.

41:14.555 --> 41:15.602
Yes, sir.

41:15.765 --> 41:18.314
The hoses!

41:21.479 --> 41:21.979
Music

44:38.259 --> 44:41.479
[applauding]

44:41.637 --> 44:44.060
A toast to el capitan.

44:44.599 --> 44:46.226
A toast to el capitan!

44:46.392 --> 44:50.989
With the hope that this
beautiful occasion may serve to

44:51.147 --> 44:54.572
bring those two great countries
Spain and Germany,

44:54.734 --> 44:56.156
closer together.

44:56.319 --> 45:00.495
The Spanish heritage, the
German empire in all its glory.

45:00.656 --> 45:03.409
El capitan!

45:03.576 --> 45:05.874
Good God.

45:16.881 --> 45:19.100
Looking for someone?

45:19.800 --> 45:21.302
What do you mean?

45:21.469 --> 45:24.598
Dr. Schumann is a very
charming man, isn't he?

45:26.390 --> 45:29.485
He's in steerage.

45:31.646 --> 45:35.025
People say there are only
three reasons why a man would

45:35.191 --> 45:38.035
be a ship's doctor:
He wants to travel.

45:38.194 --> 45:40.447
Or his health is not good.

45:40.613 --> 45:43.287
Or he's escaping from the law.

45:43.449 --> 45:46.623
Which is it with
Dr. Schumann?

45:47.453 --> 45:52.209
Dr. Schumann has a quite
serious case of heart trouble.

45:56.170 --> 45:59.549
Will you excuse me?

46:03.219 --> 46:03.719
Music

46:16.107 --> 46:19.577
- What is your name?
- My name is Johann.

46:20.444 --> 46:23.789
Why were you
staring at me, Johann?

46:25.533 --> 46:28.127
- How is your father?
- He's my uncle.

46:28.286 --> 46:30.084
He's sleeping in the cabin.

46:30.246 --> 46:33.250
The doctor gave him
something to quiet him down.

46:33.416 --> 46:34.884
Dance with me.

46:35.042 --> 46:36.840
I don't dance.

46:37.003 --> 46:39.756
I will show you.

46:40.214 --> 46:40.714
Music

46:59.984 --> 47:02.453
Do you feel that?

47:02.611 --> 47:06.036
Only Spanish
women move like that.

47:06.198 --> 47:09.702
It is called the meneo.

47:12.204 --> 47:15.048
Feel?

47:15.207 --> 47:16.880
I am not a gypsy, you know.

47:17.043 --> 47:20.923
I am real Spanish,
and this is the sign.

47:21.088 --> 47:22.556
You're doing it on purpose.

47:22.715 --> 47:25.389
Oh, no.

47:25.551 --> 47:28.646
I was born this way.

47:32.516 --> 47:35.690
Do you hear what they say?

47:35.853 --> 47:38.447
My hip bones.

47:39.940 --> 47:47.940
They say, Meneo
meneo all by themselves.

47:52.453 --> 47:54.296
Will you buy me a
bottle of champagne?

47:54.455 --> 47:56.332
I can't.

47:56.499 --> 47:58.092
Just a small bottle.

47:58.250 --> 47:59.627
I don't have anything.

47:59.794 --> 48:02.388
Not a pfennig.

48:04.507 --> 48:07.511
Excuse me.

48:07.676 --> 48:08.176
Music

48:31.867 --> 48:33.665
[applauding]

48:33.828 --> 48:34.954
Shall we sit down?

48:35.121 --> 48:38.125
Oh, yes.
Of course.

48:39.125 --> 48:40.377
Here we are.

48:40.543 --> 48:41.886
You're doing
your job very well.

48:42.044 --> 48:43.421
My job?

48:43.587 --> 48:45.305
Isn't it the duty of the
ship's personnel to see that

48:45.464 --> 48:48.593
unescorted women
don't get too unhappy?

48:48.759 --> 48:51.137
I am here because I want to be.

48:51.303 --> 48:53.726
Now you really
are doing very well.

48:53.889 --> 48:55.937
Don't you believe me?

48:56.100 --> 48:58.478
Does it matter
whether I do or not?

48:59.728 --> 49:01.981
Perhaps you would
prefer to remain alone.

49:02.148 --> 49:03.741
Oh, no.
No.

49:03.899 --> 49:07.369
Please stay and
have a drink with me.

49:07.528 --> 49:09.747
It's my birthday.

49:09.905 --> 49:11.828
Is it really your birthday?

49:11.991 --> 49:13.459
Forty six.

49:13.617 --> 49:15.085
Me, forty six.

49:15.244 --> 49:18.293
I can't believe it, 46.

49:19.373 --> 49:23.298
We Europeans are not as
conscious of age as you are.

49:23.461 --> 49:26.089
When one looks as you do and
arouses in people the feeling

49:26.255 --> 49:29.350
you do, does it really matter?

49:29.508 --> 49:31.727
You're very kind.

49:31.886 --> 49:35.607
There's a time when
hearts grow cold and hard.

49:35.764 --> 49:38.938
Women lose their
grace and become shrill.

49:39.101 --> 49:42.981
They run to fat
or turn to beanpoles.

49:43.147 --> 49:45.616
Take to secret drinking.

49:45.774 --> 49:48.027
They marry men too
young for them and get

49:48.194 --> 49:51.164
just what they deserve.

49:52.740 --> 49:55.459
It's enough to scare anyone,
waiting for fear and loneliness

49:55.618 --> 49:59.213
to do their work.

49:59.371 --> 50:02.295
Mrs. Treadwell, you are
a very exciting woman,

50:02.458 --> 50:05.632
and you know it.

50:08.547 --> 50:14.270
Tell me, wouldn't it unnerve
you to have an affair with me?

50:15.095 --> 50:15.595
Music

50:21.894 --> 50:24.067
Good evening.
Are you enjoying yourselves?

50:24.230 --> 50:26.073
You're not dancing.

50:26.232 --> 50:27.529
Captain, do you have a second?

50:27.691 --> 50:28.783
Yes.

50:28.943 --> 50:30.365
There's a man in steerage.

50:30.528 --> 50:32.622
One of your men took
his carving knife away.

50:32.780 --> 50:35.750
He needs his
knife for his work.

50:35.908 --> 50:38.627
This is the kind
of thing he does.

50:39.119 --> 50:41.042
Very nice.
Very nice indeed.

50:41.205 --> 50:42.422
The man's an artist.

50:42.581 --> 50:45.380
He's not gonna
do anybody any harm.

50:46.418 --> 50:48.591
You are
absolutely certain of that?

50:48.754 --> 50:50.347
I'm certain.

50:50.506 --> 50:52.929
Unfortunately, I have to be
answerable not only for your

50:53.092 --> 50:56.437
safety but for the
safety of the ship.

50:56.595 --> 50:58.518
Captain, the man is an artist.

50:58.681 --> 51:00.479
He needs his
knife for his work.

51:00.641 --> 51:02.188
I'm sorry.

51:02.351 --> 51:04.774
Enjoy the Part)!

51:08.315 --> 51:11.364
I feel sorry for him.

51:11.527 --> 51:14.781
You feel sorry for him?

51:14.947 --> 51:16.324
He's a nice man.

51:16.490 --> 51:17.833
He doesn't like doing this.

51:17.992 --> 51:19.335
But he's doing it.

51:19.493 --> 51:22.246
That's the point, isn't it?

51:23.539 --> 51:27.589
David, you're gonna hate
me for this but I'm glad those

51:27.751 --> 51:30.971
people in steerage
don't have knives.

51:32.131 --> 51:34.475
Afraid they'll come up over
the sides and murder us in our

51:34.633 --> 51:37.557
nice, clean, white beds?

51:38.387 --> 51:41.015
Maybe they should.

51:42.266 --> 51:45.691
You're so unattractive
when you get like this.

51:45.853 --> 51:49.153
So violent and myopic.

51:49.315 --> 51:53.411
It's exactly the kind of
thing that infects your work.

51:56.697 --> 52:00.372
What about my work?

52:15.966 --> 52:18.185
I told you no one
would dance with me.

52:18.344 --> 52:20.187
Elsa, dance with your father.

52:20.346 --> 52:21.768
Mama, please.

52:21.930 --> 52:23.523
Dance with your father.

52:23.682 --> 52:26.561
Elsa, when you go to a
dance, you first dance

52:26.727 --> 52:28.650
with your escort.

52:28.812 --> 52:32.442
Now, I am your escort, so
you will first dance with me.

52:32.608 --> 52:34.576
Then, when you're seen
dancing, someone else

52:34.735 --> 52:37.705
will invite you.

52:37.863 --> 52:40.457
Besides, you haven't
danced with your papa since

52:40.616 --> 52:43.665
your last birthday.

52:43.827 --> 52:45.955
Papa, please.

52:46.121 --> 52:48.795
I don't want to dance.

53:08.811 --> 53:10.404
I'm sorry.

53:10.562 --> 53:12.439
I didn't know anyone was here.

53:12.606 --> 53:13.903
Don't be ashamed.

53:14.066 --> 53:15.318
What's the matter?

53:15.484 --> 53:16.736
Come here.
Sit down.

53:16.902 --> 53:18.074
Sit down.

53:18.237 --> 53:20.990
Come here.

53:21.824 --> 53:23.451
Tears are good.

53:23.617 --> 53:25.460
You know what
they say in Turkey?

53:25.619 --> 53:30.375
They say tears wash the
eyes and one can see better.

53:30.541 --> 53:33.090
At least I think
they say it in Turkey.

53:33.252 --> 53:34.970
Turkey.

53:35.129 --> 53:37.257
Now tell us, what is
the reason for this

53:37.423 --> 53:39.517
great emotional outburst?

53:39.675 --> 53:43.145
Why isn't a charming young
lady like you inside enjoying

53:43.303 --> 53:45.977
the music and dancing?

53:46.140 --> 53:48.609
Because no one
wants to dance with me.

53:48.767 --> 53:50.861
And I'm not charming.

53:51.019 --> 53:53.488
You are telling me
you are not charming?

53:53.647 --> 53:57.823
An expert who has been to
Istanbul, Hamburg and Paris?

53:57.985 --> 53:59.908
You are telling me?

54:00.070 --> 54:02.619
I am telling you that
anybody with eyes in his head

54:02.781 --> 54:05.000
can see that you are charming.

54:05.159 --> 54:07.787
Ask anybody with
any intelligence.

54:07.953 --> 54:09.375
Ask Glocken.

54:09.538 --> 54:12.291
Is this young lady
charming or isn't she?

54:12.458 --> 54:14.256
Charming.

54:14.418 --> 54:15.715
There.

54:15.878 --> 54:17.221
I told you.

54:17.379 --> 54:18.847
And how old are you?

54:19.006 --> 54:22.556
Sixteen.

54:22.718 --> 54:24.891
Adolescence.

54:25.053 --> 54:26.771
What is adolescence?

54:26.930 --> 54:30.480
Adolescence is a time
when people worry about things

54:30.642 --> 54:33.771
there's no need to worry about.

54:33.937 --> 54:35.689
Sixteen.

54:35.856 --> 54:39.781
I promise you, at 17, you
will be even more charming

54:39.943 --> 54:41.616
than you are now.

54:41.779 --> 54:44.578
At 21, you will be gorgeous.

54:44.740 --> 54:48.210
And at 25, devastating.

54:48.368 --> 54:52.123
And I won't
stand any arguments.

54:55.375 --> 54:55.875
Music

55:31.036 --> 55:34.666
Tales from the Vienna Woods.

55:36.041 --> 55:39.545
David, Tales
from the Vienna Woods.

55:41.171 --> 55:43.515
Dance with me.

55:46.385 --> 55:49.059
You never like to dance.

55:50.848 --> 55:53.977
I think I've been
happiest when I was dancing.

55:56.270 --> 55:59.615
Sometimes I wish that I'd
tied a tape measure to my ankle

55:59.773 --> 56:03.277
when I danced all my life.

56:03.986 --> 56:05.613
Then I could tell you how
many miles I've traveled

56:05.779 --> 56:08.532
when I was happiest.

56:11.076 --> 56:13.920
David, dance with me.

56:15.372 --> 56:15.872
Music

56:43.817 --> 56:46.411
Well.

56:47.946 --> 56:52.793
I'm gonna enjoy this party
in spite of you, David so if

56:52.951 --> 56:55.124
you'll excuse me, I'm gonna
dance with the first man

56:55.287 --> 56:58.382
who asks me.

56:58.957 --> 57:01.460
And here he comes.

57:03.462 --> 57:04.759
May I have this dance?

57:04.922 --> 57:07.300
Delighted.

57:25.567 --> 57:27.240
Good evening.

57:27.945 --> 57:29.697
Good evening.

57:29.863 --> 57:31.206
You seem in good spirits.

57:31.365 --> 57:32.537
I am.

57:32.699 --> 57:33.951
I delivered a baby tonight.

57:34.117 --> 57:35.209
How wonderful.

57:35.369 --> 57:36.529
What was it, a boy or a girl?

57:36.620 --> 57:39.248
Boy.

57:39.414 --> 57:41.166
What about our celebration?

57:41.333 --> 57:42.505
What do you mean?

57:42.668 --> 57:44.215
Our dance.

57:44.378 --> 57:45.800
You intimidated me.

57:45.963 --> 57:47.636
I really don't dance.

57:47.798 --> 57:49.391
I thought so.

57:49.549 --> 57:53.304
Well, this is a waltz, and
even you can manage a waltz.

57:53.470 --> 57:54.938
I doubt it.

57:55.097 --> 57:57.441
I don't.

58:01.061 --> 58:05.157
Just follow me and
then follow the music.

58:07.943 --> 58:08.443
Music

58:21.289 --> 58:24.042
How do you feel?

58:24.209 --> 58:28.635
I can't seem to
get over this cold.

58:28.797 --> 58:30.845
But I guess I'll be
better if I can get

58:31.008 --> 58:34.182
another night's sleep.

58:34.928 --> 58:37.272
You have to help me again.

58:37.431 --> 58:38.978
It's not helping you.

58:39.141 --> 58:40.518
Oh, Willie.

58:40.684 --> 58:42.686
Don't lecture me.

58:42.853 --> 58:44.947
You'll lose count.

58:45.105 --> 58:48.484
I'm trying to tell
you how serious it is.

58:48.650 --> 58:52.450
Why are you trying to tell me?

58:52.612 --> 58:55.991
Are you trying to
tell me I'm an addict?

58:59.494 --> 59:01.713
Okay, so I bought you a
bottle of champagne, right?

59:01.872 --> 59:03.294
Right.

59:03.457 --> 59:04.834
And I know my
way around, right?

59:05.000 --> 59:06.252
Right.

59:06.418 --> 59:08.671
So when we gonna get together?

59:08.837 --> 59:10.430
We are together now.

59:10.589 --> 59:11.932
Come on, baby.

59:12.090 --> 59:13.387
You know what I mean.

59:13.550 --> 59:16.724
You mean you
want to sleep with me.

59:16.887 --> 59:18.685
First money.

59:18.847 --> 59:20.941
How much money?

59:21.099 --> 59:22.897
How much?

59:23.060 --> 59:26.405
Forty dollars.

59:28.565 --> 59:31.364
You're out of your mind.

59:31.526 --> 59:35.201
As a publisher, my aim is
to direct readers to the vital

59:35.363 --> 59:37.240
issues of our society.

59:37.407 --> 59:39.876
I have lately got a doctor
to begin a series of articles

59:40.035 --> 59:44.541
advocating the extermination
of all the unfit at birth.

59:44.706 --> 59:46.583
That's the way
it's with Herr Rieber.

59:46.750 --> 59:49.094
He's thinking all the time.

59:49.252 --> 59:51.971
All this will be accomplished
painlessly, of course.

59:52.130 --> 59:53.507
Painlessly.

59:53.673 --> 59:55.675
Not only defective
or useless children,

59:55.842 --> 59:57.560
but the old too.

59:57.719 --> 01:00:01.565
Old persons over
60 or 65, perhaps.

01:00:01.723 --> 01:00:04.067
The same measures will be
taken with Jews, of course

01:00:04.226 --> 01:00:07.321
and any illegitimate
mixtures of race.

01:00:07.479 --> 01:00:12.861
White with colored of any
kind, Chinese, Negroes and for

01:00:13.026 --> 01:00:19.284
any white man convicted of a
serious crime well, as for him.

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:21.747
There is only one
problem with all this.

01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:24.083
Who will be left?

01:00:24.246 --> 01:00:25.418
That is the difficulty.

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:28.254
No one is ever
willing to accept a new idea.

01:00:29.835 --> 01:00:32.213
Shall we dance?

01:00:37.259 --> 01:00:39.557
I like to
listen to Herr Rieber.

01:00:39.719 --> 01:00:43.974
Every time I listen
to him, I feel reassured.

01:00:44.141 --> 01:00:45.893
I know no one could
ever take him

01:00:46.059 --> 01:00:49.438
or his party seriously.

01:00:58.029 --> 01:01:00.578
Pardon me.

01:01:05.537 --> 01:01:08.461
May I?

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:20.890
How do you feel?

01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:25.432
Try a little longer.

01:01:25.599 --> 01:01:28.648
I promise to help
you when the time comes.

01:01:30.979 --> 01:01:33.823
I want to sit down.

01:01:49.998 --> 01:01:54.754
It's a nice party.
Are you enjoying it?

01:01:55.629 --> 01:01:58.428
Can I have a cigarette, please?

01:02:12.354 --> 01:02:14.903
May I get you something?

01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:18.068
Thank you.

01:02:29.371 --> 01:02:31.794
Excuse me, please.

01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:36.252
Music

01:03:52.871 --> 01:03:55.590
I feel like I'm gonna die.

01:03:57.625 --> 01:04:00.424
I know.

01:04:22.317 --> 01:04:23.409
What's wrong with you?

01:04:23.568 --> 01:04:24.649
You are selfish, boorish...

01:04:24.736 --> 01:04:25.828
Don't know why I can't
get you out of my system.

01:04:25.987 --> 01:04:27.204
You're not even pretty.

01:04:27.364 --> 01:04:28.866
Your head is
filled with such garbage!

01:04:29.032 --> 01:04:30.409
I wish I could empty it.

01:04:30.575 --> 01:04:32.293
Take your hands off me!

01:04:32.452 --> 01:04:33.419
David, stop it.

01:04:33.578 --> 01:04:36.081
I'll call for the purser.

01:04:48.593 --> 01:04:51.096
Leave me alone.

01:04:51.262 --> 01:04:52.605
Jenny, Jenny.

01:04:52.764 --> 01:04:53.890
What?

01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:55.309
What do you want from me?

01:04:55.475 --> 01:04:57.022
What?

01:04:57.185 --> 01:04:59.233
I wish I knew.

01:05:01.773 --> 01:05:03.821
Oh, Jenny.

01:05:03.983 --> 01:05:06.111
Jenny, what's the matter?

01:05:06.277 --> 01:05:07.779
I'm crying.

01:05:07.946 --> 01:05:10.495
That's what's the matter,
I'm crying.

01:05:14.327 --> 01:05:15.829
The sweetest face.

01:05:15.995 --> 01:05:17.668
The sweetest face in the world.

01:05:17.831 --> 01:05:19.378
David.

01:05:19.541 --> 01:05:22.294
David, what's
gonna happen to us?

01:05:39.102 --> 01:05:41.946
You never were
any good at that.

01:05:42.689 --> 01:05:45.659
It has a zipper, remember?

01:05:46.901 --> 01:05:49.404
What a wonderful sky.

01:05:49.571 --> 01:05:53.792
I'm sure you and your
wife watch clouds together.

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:57.875
I wish there was someone
to watch clouds with me.

01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:02.793
You're an extremely romantic
woman, Mrs. Treadwell,

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:04.427
aren't you?

01:06:04.586 --> 01:06:08.216
It's been the
handicap of my life.

01:06:08.381 --> 01:06:11.225
I can't settle for things.

01:06:11.384 --> 01:06:13.432
Bernard Shaw
said it, didn't he?

01:06:13.595 --> 01:06:15.939
If you can't get what
you want, you better damn well

01:06:16.097 --> 01:06:18.316
settle for what you can get.

01:06:18.475 --> 01:06:22.275
What did you want,
Mrs. Treadwell?

01:06:22.437 --> 01:06:25.532
A useful life.

01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:29.536
Someone to love me.
Forever.

01:06:29.694 --> 01:06:33.619
Ridiculous of me, wasn't it?

01:06:33.781 --> 01:06:38.662
And what happened?

01:06:38.828 --> 01:06:41.502
I chose the wrong man.

01:06:41.664 --> 01:06:45.544
How many times have you
heard that said, I wonder.

01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:47.553
He was the most promising.

01:06:47.712 --> 01:06:49.214
The most handsome.

01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:52.350
He had the most
glorious facade.

01:06:52.509 --> 01:06:56.810
The facade was all there was.

01:06:56.971 --> 01:06:59.019
He made me the best-known
wife of the best-known

01:06:59.182 --> 01:07:02.686
skirt-chaser in the community.

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:07.073
I made life hell for him.

01:07:07.232 --> 01:07:10.076
It ended in the divorce courts.

01:07:10.235 --> 01:07:14.456
We met one day in the
corridor outside the courtroom.

01:07:14.614 --> 01:07:18.619
He struck me.

01:07:18.785 --> 01:07:23.712
I took every penny he had.

01:07:27.043 --> 01:07:29.546
So you must forgive me if
I'm not exactly receptive to

01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:32.761
the idea of other
people's happiness in marriage.

01:07:32.924 --> 01:07:36.098
I'm envious.

01:07:39.973 --> 01:07:41.771
You and your wife probably
have the closest thing to

01:07:41.933 --> 01:07:46.655
a perfect life one can get.

01:07:50.441 --> 01:07:54.196
Nothing is perfect,
Mrs. Treadwell.

01:07:57.490 --> 01:07:59.538
I just wanted to tell
you that I would have

01:07:59.701 --> 01:08:01.544
bought the champagne.

01:08:01.703 --> 01:08:04.832
I would have bought
it if I had the money.

01:08:06.541 --> 01:08:09.090
Come in.

01:08:17.176 --> 01:08:19.178
How old are you?

01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:20.517
Nineteen.

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:24.024
You're one year
older than I am.

01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:28.484
Can you give me something?

01:08:28.645 --> 01:08:31.444
I'm not asking for much,
but I must have something.

01:08:31.608 --> 01:08:33.656
Pepe would beat me within an
inch of my life if I don't give

01:08:33.818 --> 01:08:36.116
him something.

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:39.578
But aren't you a dancer?

01:08:47.247 --> 01:08:49.626
You better go.

01:08:57.591 --> 01:08:58.935
Good.

01:08:59.093 --> 01:09:00.515
More dollars.

01:09:00.678 --> 01:09:05.399
Let's see, there was
the student and the sailor.

01:09:05.558 --> 01:09:06.854
What about him?

01:09:07.018 --> 01:09:08.109
He did not have anything.

01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:09.612
What was he doing here?

01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:12.819
He wanted to see me.

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:14.654
Did it ever occur to you
that someone might just want to

01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:16.319
see me?

01:09:16.486 --> 01:09:18.988
That I might want to be
with someone my own age?

01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:21.874
I am a human being, too,
whether you think so or not.

01:09:22.033 --> 01:09:23.455
Who told you?

01:09:23.618 --> 01:09:25.040
Who told you you
were a human being?

01:09:25.203 --> 01:09:26.796
If it were up to you,
I'd spend the whole voyage

01:09:26.953 --> 01:09:28.001
on my back.

01:09:28.163 --> 01:09:30.383
What you are is something
I picked up on the street

01:09:30.541 --> 01:09:32.259
at 14 with dirty underpants.

01:09:32.417 --> 01:09:34.259
Trying to stop men for
a few centavitos for you

01:09:34.337 --> 01:09:37.807
and your dirty family.

01:09:38.091 --> 01:09:42.345
[snoring]

01:09:57.485 --> 01:10:00.955
[snoring]

01:10:10.498 --> 01:10:14.628
[snoring]

01:10:19.298 --> 01:10:21.517
Lowenthal!

01:10:21.676 --> 01:10:24.429
You're snoring!

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:28.854
That's what my wife says.

01:10:31.185 --> 01:10:34.564
Why are they doing this to you?

01:10:39.193 --> 01:10:42.242
I lived with a man who
controlled the lives

01:10:42.405 --> 01:10:45.204
of 5,000 people.

01:10:45.366 --> 01:10:47.744
I mean controlled.

01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:51.289
I didn't want to,
but I became entangled

01:10:51.456 --> 01:10:53.333
with those people's lives.

01:10:53.499 --> 01:10:56.628
I came to know that every
piece of food I ate, every piece

01:10:56.794 --> 01:11:03.973
of clothing I had was
coming out of their lives.

01:11:04.135 --> 01:11:08.891
One day, I entered
one of their houses.

01:11:09.056 --> 01:11:11.809
I'll never forget it.

01:11:11.976 --> 01:11:15.150
The woman who lived there
saw the shock in my eyes

01:11:15.313 --> 01:11:18.783
at the way they lived.

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:24.994
And she said, "Pardon me."

01:11:25.156 --> 01:11:28.751
I said, "Pardon you for what?"

01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:32.289
So she said, "Pardon me for
my house, pardon me for the way

01:11:32.455 --> 01:11:38.087
it looks, pardon
me for everything."

01:11:38.252 --> 01:11:41.722
And then she said, "But of
course, you must understand

01:11:41.881 --> 01:11:45.761
"that most of this place
is a garbage dump,

01:11:45.927 --> 01:11:50.478
and I'm just a
piece of garbage."

01:11:51.849 --> 01:11:56.400
I began by hiding agitators
in the chapel of the house

01:11:56.562 --> 01:12:02.319
and I ended by helping
them get arms.

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:09.204
You don't say anything.

01:12:09.367 --> 01:12:12.166
I don't know what to say.

01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:15.081
I haven't met many people
in my life who have committed

01:12:15.248 --> 01:12:18.218
themselves to anything.

01:12:18.376 --> 01:12:22.597
You never talk about yourself.

01:12:23.339 --> 01:12:25.717
There's not very much to tell.

01:12:25.883 --> 01:12:28.807
I came from a Hamburg
worker's family. I worked hard

01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:30.893
to become a doctor.

01:12:31.055 --> 01:12:33.683
I tried to be a man,
I got this.

01:12:33.850 --> 01:12:35.352
It is formidable.

01:12:35.518 --> 01:12:36.735
It's idiotic.

01:12:36.894 --> 01:12:41.775
Marked for life like cattle.

01:12:41.941 --> 01:12:46.287
- Are you married?
- Mm-hmm.

01:12:46.445 --> 01:12:48.789
Children?

01:12:48.948 --> 01:12:51.451
Two sons.

01:12:51.617 --> 01:12:55.042
Are you happy?

01:12:55.705 --> 01:12:59.300
Who is happy?

01:13:00.543 --> 01:13:03.547
Why isn't she
here with you now?

01:13:04.171 --> 01:13:06.173
There was no reason
in dragging her halfway

01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:09.184
across the world with me.

01:13:09.343 --> 01:13:12.973
What about you?
Are you married?

01:13:13.139 --> 01:13:14.686
Three times.

01:13:14.849 --> 01:13:17.147
What happened?

01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:19.733
Never found the right one.

01:13:19.896 --> 01:13:22.490
Maybe I was waiting
for someone like you,

01:13:22.648 --> 01:13:24.867
someone I could
teach the waltz.

01:13:25.026 --> 01:13:27.404
I'm sure.

01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:29.117
Just think.

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:32.625
Isn't it wonderful?

01:13:32.783 --> 01:13:36.208
Two strangers on a ship.

01:13:36.370 --> 01:13:39.089
We will never meet again.

01:13:39.248 --> 01:13:42.092
And we can talk.

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:45.004
We can talk like friends.

01:13:45.171 --> 01:13:47.265
Or even lovers.

01:13:47.423 --> 01:13:50.677
We can talk like two people
who meet on the other side

01:13:50.843 --> 01:13:53.187
of the grave.

01:13:53.346 --> 01:13:57.567
Keep talking.

01:13:58.476 --> 01:14:02.447
Do you have any feeling for me?

01:14:02.605 --> 01:14:07.281
No, of course not.

01:14:07.443 --> 01:14:10.663
Of course not.

01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:14.288
It's funny.

01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:18.421
You know what I
thought you might be?

01:14:18.579 --> 01:14:24.461
I thought you might be
the innocent, romantic love

01:14:24.627 --> 01:14:28.507
I should have had
in my girlhood.

01:14:31.008 --> 01:14:36.014
Of course, nobody
ever loved me innocently.

01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:40.936
And how I would have
laughed at him if he had.

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:41.810
Music

01:15:30.526 --> 01:15:34.076
I never could hit a curve
ball on the outside corner.

01:15:34.238 --> 01:15:37.742
I beg your pardon?

01:15:37.908 --> 01:15:43.039
I never could hit a curve
ball on the outside corner.

01:15:43.205 --> 01:15:44.548
That's very interesting.

01:15:44.707 --> 01:15:46.801
What does it mean?

01:15:46.959 --> 01:15:50.930
You wouldn't
know if I told you.

01:15:51.088 --> 01:15:54.388
All right, I'll tell you.

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:56.894
You're at bat, see?

01:15:57.053 --> 01:15:59.021
At bat. Bat! Bat!

01:16:04.894 --> 01:16:06.988
Okay, now you're at bat.

01:16:07.146 --> 01:16:09.649
The pitcher, he's out there.

01:16:09.815 --> 01:16:14.036
Now he's winding up, and
he turns her loose and...

01:16:14.195 --> 01:16:21.079
Just as it gets to
you, it dips down and away.

01:16:29.043 --> 01:16:33.264
And that is a curve
ball on the outside corner.

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:42.436
I could never hit
that pitch with a paddle.

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:46.523
I see.

01:16:46.685 --> 01:16:48.028
No, you don't see.

01:16:48.187 --> 01:16:50.281
You don't see at all.

01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:52.157
You don't know what it's
like to be out there crowd's

01:16:52.316 --> 01:16:54.569
yelling for you to deliver.

01:16:54.735 --> 01:16:56.908
And they start talking.

01:16:57.071 --> 01:16:58.789
The pitchers, they talk.

01:16:58.948 --> 01:17:02.669
He can't hit a curve
ball on the outside corner.

01:17:02.827 --> 01:17:05.922
And from then on out, that's
all you see is curve balls

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:10.426
on the outside corner.

01:17:10.584 --> 01:17:14.430
So you've had your big chance.

01:17:14.588 --> 01:17:16.556
And you have muffed it.

01:17:30.688 --> 01:17:32.929
I can still hear my old man
yelling at me from the stands

01:17:33.065 --> 01:17:36.660
even though he wasn't there.

01:17:36.819 --> 01:17:38.913
Big wheel.

01:17:39.071 --> 01:17:43.326
You are a bum!

01:17:47.621 --> 01:17:51.751
You are a bum, just like me.

01:18:01.218 --> 01:18:06.395
I think you're being a bit
harsh on yourself, Herr Tenny.

01:18:07.725 --> 01:18:11.355
A bum.

01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:17.486
You know, I travel a lot.

01:18:17.651 --> 01:18:19.824
My folks give me some money.

01:18:19.987 --> 01:18:22.911
Not much, but some.

01:18:23.574 --> 01:18:27.579
They are more comfortable
when I'm not around.

01:18:28.495 --> 01:18:30.964
You know what I find?

01:18:31.123 --> 01:18:34.718
I find the most amusing
things about people are their

01:18:34.877 --> 01:18:38.177
guilts that they
drum up for themselves.

01:18:38.339 --> 01:18:42.936
For instance, I estimate
that there must be at least

01:18:43.093 --> 01:18:48.896
873 million people in the
world who don't even know

01:18:49.058 --> 01:18:53.438
what a curve ball on
the outside corner is.

01:18:53.604 --> 01:18:57.108
So I think it a bit
excessive for you to think that

01:18:57.274 --> 01:19:00.153
you have muffed your whole life
just because you couldn't hit

01:19:00.319 --> 01:19:03.949
it paddle or no paddle.

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:07.789
Do you understand
what I mean, Herr Tenny?

01:19:15.209 --> 01:19:18.338
No.

01:19:18.504 --> 01:19:21.724
You know what I think?

01:19:27.930 --> 01:19:29.807
No.

01:19:29.974 --> 01:19:36.198
I think that you are
a sawed-off intellectual.

01:19:57.293 --> 01:20:00.718
Bottoms up, shorty.

01:20:07.845 --> 01:20:10.268
The purser, from whom I
learn what little I know about

01:20:10.431 --> 01:20:13.480
this ship has informed me
that you were seen leaving

01:20:13.642 --> 01:20:18.068
La Condesa's cabin at a
highly unrespectable hour.

01:20:20.899 --> 01:20:23.823
No comment, Willie?

01:20:23.986 --> 01:20:26.114
I think that's one of
the reasons I like you.

01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:29.705
You don't have my vulgarity.

01:20:29.867 --> 01:20:32.028
I wonder if it's really
true that life is as stupid and

01:20:32.036 --> 01:20:35.165
meaningless as it
seems to be on this ship.

01:20:35.331 --> 01:20:36.971
The Lutzes and their
daughter, the Huttens

01:20:37.082 --> 01:20:38.299
and their dog.

01:20:38.459 --> 01:20:40.006
And gross little Rieber, who
thinks of himself as the wave

01:20:40.169 --> 01:20:42.388
of the future.

01:20:42.546 --> 01:20:47.723
I suppose a great case could
be made for my own foolishness.

01:20:49.595 --> 01:20:53.520
Will your wife be there
to meet you at Bremerhaven?

01:20:53.682 --> 01:20:56.982
She's a wonderful woman.

01:20:57.603 --> 01:21:00.777
We've been polite to each
other for a good many years.

01:21:00.939 --> 01:21:03.818
Well, your sons
will be glad to see you.

01:21:03.984 --> 01:21:06.533
We hardly know
each other anymore.

01:21:06.695 --> 01:21:10.370
What will you do, go
back to your practice?

01:21:10.532 --> 01:21:12.159
I'm the kind of doctor I hate.

01:21:12.326 --> 01:21:16.001
The hack general practitioner.

01:21:16.163 --> 01:21:18.211
What would you
have liked to have been?

01:21:18.374 --> 01:21:19.967
A good doctor.

01:21:20.125 --> 01:21:21.502
Don't you think you are?

01:21:21.668 --> 01:21:25.593
Fair to middling.

01:21:29.551 --> 01:21:34.102
What do you think happens
to a woman like La Condesa when

01:21:34.264 --> 01:21:37.985
she's deported under
such circumstances?

01:21:45.526 --> 01:21:48.450
How long are you going to
keep me a penniless beggar?

01:21:48.612 --> 01:21:51.035
Do I have to ask you for
change to go to the barber?

01:21:51.198 --> 01:21:52.916
Remember the agreement, Johann?

01:21:53.075 --> 01:21:54.372
The agreement.

01:21:54.535 --> 01:21:57.960
You are to receive
everything after my death.

01:21:58.122 --> 01:22:00.466
Your mother was
so pleased for you.

01:22:00.624 --> 01:22:03.298
She was so pleased
for your opportunity.

01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:07.806
My mother was pleased for a
chance for money for herself.

01:22:07.965 --> 01:22:09.842
How can you keep
me a penniless beggar?

01:22:10.008 --> 01:22:11.760
How can you do that?

01:22:11.927 --> 01:22:13.179
Don't you have a heart at all?

01:22:13.345 --> 01:22:14.813
I have a heart.

01:22:14.972 --> 01:22:17.316
That's why I can do it.

01:22:17.474 --> 01:22:20.728
What would you do
with the money, Johann?

01:22:20.894 --> 01:22:25.320
I have seen you watch that
gypsy dancer's buttocks

01:22:25.482 --> 01:22:27.860
as she walks on the deck.

01:22:28.026 --> 01:22:31.747
I will not nourish your lust.

01:22:39.413 --> 01:22:41.461
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:22:41.623 --> 01:22:43.671
I have been trying to
persuade Mrs. Treadwell

01:22:43.834 --> 01:22:45.336
to have some breakfast.

01:22:45.502 --> 01:22:46.823
There's nothing
like it, you know.

01:22:46.879 --> 01:22:48.722
Especially the morning after.

01:22:48.881 --> 01:22:53.057
At home, we always used to
have it English style: Kidneys,

01:22:53.218 --> 01:22:57.018
sausages, kippers,
things like that.

01:22:57.181 --> 01:22:59.650
How elegant.

01:22:59.808 --> 01:23:03.403
Well, I think I'll look
in on the bar before dinner.

01:23:08.108 --> 01:23:10.861
What a
hard-trying race they are.

01:23:11.028 --> 01:23:13.872
English style for breakfast,
French style for dinner.

01:23:14.031 --> 01:23:16.409
And every now and again,
a comfortable lapse back

01:23:16.575 --> 01:23:19.670
to sauerbraten,
sauerkraut and beer.

01:23:19.828 --> 01:23:22.877
He seems very attentive,
I'll say that for him.

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:25.543
Did you ever see such
a collection of bores'?

01:23:25.709 --> 01:23:28.633
The attentive Lt. Huebner,
the happily-married man,

01:23:28.795 --> 01:23:30.388
Herr Freytag.

01:23:30.547 --> 01:23:32.845
And here comes the ape.

01:23:33.008 --> 01:23:39.266
Morning.
How's the painting?

01:23:39.431 --> 01:23:42.184
I haven't been able to
do much on board, but here's

01:23:42.351 --> 01:23:47.608
something I've
been doodling with.

01:23:47.773 --> 01:23:51.323
- You can see I'm in love.
- Of course.

01:23:51.485 --> 01:23:54.079
Everybody on
this ship is in love.

01:23:54.238 --> 01:23:57.037
Love me whether
or not I love you.

01:23:57.199 --> 01:24:00.203
Love me whether
I am fit to love.

01:24:00.369 --> 01:24:02.417
Love me whether
I am able to love.

01:24:02.579 --> 01:24:06.049
Even if there is
no such thing as love.

01:24:06.208 --> 01:24:09.132
Love me.

01:24:23.308 --> 01:24:24.810
Where've you been?

01:24:24.977 --> 01:24:26.820
I've been talking
to that Mrs. Treadwell.

01:24:26.979 --> 01:24:28.231
She's so bitter.

01:24:28.397 --> 01:24:31.492
She frightens me sometimes.

01:24:32.234 --> 01:24:34.328
Well, what do you think?

01:24:34.486 --> 01:24:37.786
It's interesting.

01:24:41.076 --> 01:24:43.204
I think it's good.

01:24:43.370 --> 01:24:44.838
Well, of course it's good.

01:24:44.997 --> 01:24:48.251
You couldn't do
anything that wouldn't be good.

01:24:48.417 --> 01:24:50.465
It's wonderful.

01:24:50.627 --> 01:24:53.676
But?

01:24:53.839 --> 01:24:58.140
Does it have to be the
same thing all the time?

01:24:58.302 --> 01:25:00.179
Just what do you mean?

01:25:00.345 --> 01:25:03.770
You know, the
exploitation of the masses.

01:25:03.932 --> 01:25:07.027
Well, it's true, isn't it?

01:25:07.185 --> 01:25:08.858
Well, it's just that...

01:25:09.021 --> 01:25:11.274
No matter how well these
things are done, they always

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:17.447
turn out to be posters
after all, don't they?

01:25:17.613 --> 01:25:22.414
You hate my work,
don't you, Jenny?

01:25:27.581 --> 01:25:30.460
I think it's good.

01:25:35.422 --> 01:25:40.053
[speaking foreign language]

01:25:43.597 --> 01:25:44.814
Here he comes.

01:25:44.973 --> 01:25:46.020
Now, watch.

01:25:46.183 --> 01:25:47.184
What is it?

01:25:47.351 --> 01:25:48.398
I told the steward.

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:51.109
Just watch.

01:25:56.985 --> 01:25:58.987
If you will come this way, sir.

01:25:59.154 --> 01:26:00.326
I'm going to have lunch.

01:26:00.489 --> 01:26:01.456
Yes.

01:26:01.615 --> 01:26:04.118
Another table has
been arranged for you.

01:26:04.284 --> 01:26:05.501
Arranged?

01:26:05.661 --> 01:26:06.537
Who arranged it?

01:26:06.703 --> 01:26:09.582
Right over here, sir.

01:26:19.132 --> 01:26:21.726
Now he will see how we feel.

01:26:21.885 --> 01:26:24.513
Dr. Schumann, they
have placed Herr Freytag

01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:27.524
at another table.

01:26:30.018 --> 01:26:32.521
Herr Rieber, you
are a real anti-Semite.

01:26:32.688 --> 01:26:34.190
I don't know any Jews.

01:26:34.356 --> 01:26:36.233
I don't know
anything about them at all.

01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:37.822
I'm not an anti-Semite.

01:26:37.984 --> 01:26:39.452
How can you say that?

01:26:39.611 --> 01:26:40.988
I'm very fond of the Arabs.

01:26:41.154 --> 01:26:42.747
I lived among them for
a while and found them

01:26:42.906 --> 01:26:45.159
to be very good people.

01:26:45.325 --> 01:26:47.623
You have not said a
word, Dr. Schumann.

01:26:47.786 --> 01:26:49.208
What do you think about?

01:26:49.371 --> 01:26:51.715
Excuse me.

01:26:53.458 --> 01:26:56.428
Doctor has heart trouble.

01:26:56.962 --> 01:27:00.683
Do you suppose we should
send to inquire after him?

01:27:04.261 --> 01:27:06.309
Schumann.

01:27:07.305 --> 01:27:09.649
Schumann.

01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:13.024
Is that not a Jewish name?

01:27:13.729 --> 01:27:16.608
My wife is Jewish.

01:27:16.773 --> 01:27:19.652
I told that American woman.

01:27:19.818 --> 01:27:21.491
She must have told them.

01:27:21.653 --> 01:27:23.371
Come, have some wine.

01:27:23.530 --> 01:27:26.158
It's Niersteiner Domtal.

01:27:26.324 --> 01:27:27.792
Why be upset?

01:27:27.951 --> 01:27:30.124
The company is much
better at this table,

01:27:30.287 --> 01:27:31.914
I can assure you.

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:33.957
When Glocken isn't
smoking one of his

01:27:34.124 --> 01:27:38.675
foul-smelling cigars.

01:27:38.837 --> 01:27:43.058
I don't mind not being
seated at the captain's table.

01:27:43.216 --> 01:27:47.096
Perhaps because I was never
invited in the first place.

01:27:47.262 --> 01:27:51.358
Those pious hypocrites.

01:27:51.516 --> 01:27:53.689
Why do you take it?

01:27:53.852 --> 01:27:55.980
I have been taking
it for a long time.

01:27:56.146 --> 01:27:58.114
Oh, yes, he has.

01:27:58.273 --> 01:28:02.494
He has 2,000 years
of suffering behind him.

01:28:02.652 --> 01:28:04.575
Well, I'm not going to take it.

01:28:04.738 --> 01:28:06.615
A little patience.

01:28:06.782 --> 01:28:08.659
A little understanding.

01:28:08.825 --> 01:28:11.328
The world's getting
better all the time.

01:28:11.495 --> 01:28:13.168
As my Aunt Rebecca
used to say...

01:28:13.330 --> 01:28:16.755
I don't give a damn what
your Aunt Rebecca used to say.

01:28:24.716 --> 01:28:29.563
Do you think any of you are
any better Germans than I am?

01:28:30.597 --> 01:28:33.020
Do you?

01:28:37.354 --> 01:28:42.360
Yes, yes, I have a Jewish wife.

01:28:42.901 --> 01:28:44.653
She's Jewish.

01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:47.824
Let me tell you about her.

01:28:47.989 --> 01:28:53.837
She'd never hurt
anyone in her life.

01:28:54.538 --> 01:28:56.961
Anyone.

01:28:58.583 --> 01:29:00.301
You...

01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:03.179
You good, middling people.

01:29:03.338 --> 01:29:06.968
You aren't fit to be
in the same world as her.

01:29:07.551 --> 01:29:09.599
I saw some of you in
the chapel this morning.

01:29:09.761 --> 01:29:11.354
You kneel there and pray.

01:29:11.513 --> 01:29:15.188
You pretend that
you are good people.

01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:18.479
Good people?

01:29:18.645 --> 01:29:23.492
You can't even exist
without your prejudices.

01:29:23.650 --> 01:29:27.780
And the worst thing about
you is that you don't even

01:29:27.946 --> 01:29:31.826
recognize what you are.

01:29:31.992 --> 01:29:34.996
You...

01:29:44.462 --> 01:29:48.933
Sometimes I think, in spite
of how much you understand,

01:29:49.092 --> 01:29:52.471
it's enough already.

01:29:52.637 --> 01:29:55.186
What's going on?

01:29:55.348 --> 01:29:57.708
They moved Herr Freytag from
the captain's table because his

01:29:57.726 --> 01:30:01.151
wife is Jewish.

01:30:02.063 --> 01:30:04.282
And it's my fault.

01:30:04.441 --> 01:30:06.561
I had to tell that dreadful
Brunhilda to stop her from

01:30:06.568 --> 01:30:09.037
chattering on so.

01:30:09.195 --> 01:30:11.539
So stupid of me.

01:30:11.698 --> 01:30:15.419
He's such a nice man.

01:30:15.577 --> 01:30:19.673
I'd no idea this
was going to happen.

01:30:19.831 --> 01:30:22.425
You're not gonna cry, are you?

01:30:22.584 --> 01:30:24.882
Of course not.

01:30:25.045 --> 01:30:27.298
I never cry.

01:30:32.552 --> 01:30:35.806
What do they got
against the Jews?

01:30:35.972 --> 01:30:38.816
Back home, we don't have
anything against the Jews.

01:30:38.975 --> 01:30:42.525
Hell, I never even
saw a Jew 'til I was 15.

01:30:43.396 --> 01:30:45.490
Maybe you were too busy
lynching Negroes to take time

01:30:45.649 --> 01:30:48.152
out for the Jews.

01:31:11.925 --> 01:31:13.802
Why don't you
ring for the steward?

01:31:13.969 --> 01:31:15.141
He might give you something.

01:31:15.303 --> 01:31:16.429
I have been ringing!

01:31:16.596 --> 01:31:18.815
Ringing! Ringing!
Ringing!

01:31:18.974 --> 01:31:21.898
A fellow gave these
pills to me in Tangiers.

01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:25.280
He had a theory that
seasickness has something to do

01:31:25.438 --> 01:31:28.237
with the eardrums.

01:31:28.650 --> 01:31:29.947
You know, Lowenthal?

01:31:30.110 --> 01:31:32.238
Yes?

01:31:32.404 --> 01:31:34.498
You are really
not such a bad fellow.

01:31:34.656 --> 01:31:36.124
You think so?

01:31:36.282 --> 01:31:39.035
These statements that
I make, you mustn't

01:31:39.202 --> 01:31:41.546
take them personally.

01:31:41.705 --> 01:31:43.173
No, of course not.

01:31:43.331 --> 01:31:45.049
It is the march of history.

01:31:45.208 --> 01:31:49.509
History is beyond
us, Lowenthal.

01:31:51.339 --> 01:31:53.558
Feel better?

01:31:53.717 --> 01:31:55.060
A little.

01:31:55.218 --> 01:31:56.515
Good.

01:31:56.678 --> 01:31:58.146
The thing I can't understand
is why you want

01:31:58.304 --> 01:32:00.056
to go back to Germany.

01:32:00.223 --> 01:32:03.147
I would not want to be
where I was not wanted.

01:32:03.309 --> 01:32:05.357
Why don't you go
back to your own country?

01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:06.942
Germany is my country.

01:32:07.105 --> 01:32:08.402
My father was born in Germany.

01:32:08.565 --> 01:32:10.988
And my grandfather
was born in Germany.

01:32:11.151 --> 01:32:13.620
As a matter of fact,
where are you from?

01:32:13.778 --> 01:32:15.780
I can't place your accent.

01:32:15.947 --> 01:32:18.917
You speak German like
no one I have ever heard.

01:32:19.075 --> 01:32:22.830
The last 20 years of my
life were spent in Germany.

01:32:22.996 --> 01:32:26.250
Austria?

01:32:26.416 --> 01:32:28.384
Near the border.

01:32:28.543 --> 01:32:30.341
That's what I thought.

01:32:30.503 --> 01:32:32.623
You know it is a historical
fact that the Jews are the

01:32:32.672 --> 01:32:34.390
basis of our misfortunes.

01:32:34.549 --> 01:32:35.721
Of course.

01:32:35.884 --> 01:32:37.010
You agree?

01:32:37.177 --> 01:32:38.303
Of course.

01:32:38.470 --> 01:32:39.972
The Jews and
the bicycle riders.

01:32:40.138 --> 01:32:41.811
Bicycle riders?

01:32:41.973 --> 01:32:44.567
Why the bicycle riders?

01:32:44.726 --> 01:32:47.229
Why the Jews?

01:33:30.647 --> 01:33:33.742
[screaming]

01:33:38.238 --> 01:33:39.740
Hey, what's going on?

01:33:39.906 --> 01:33:43.410
Man overboard!
Man overboard!

01:33:43.576 --> 01:33:48.332
Hey, man overboard!

01:34:23.199 --> 01:34:25.201
Get her out of here!

01:34:25.368 --> 01:34:28.121
Take her to our cabin, please.

01:34:32.250 --> 01:34:34.719
Turn him over.

01:35:04.574 --> 01:35:06.793
Can you understand it?

01:35:06.951 --> 01:35:09.329
A man jumps from a moving
ship at night, in the middle

01:35:09.495 --> 01:35:11.122
of the ocean.

01:35:11.289 --> 01:35:14.133
And is drowned to
save the life of a dog.

01:35:14.292 --> 01:35:17.512
Yes, I can understand.

01:35:18.046 --> 01:35:19.639
Who was he?

01:35:19.797 --> 01:35:21.470
He was a woodcarver.

01:35:21.633 --> 01:35:24.887
He carved little
animals with his pocketknife.

01:35:36.272 --> 01:35:37.819
Come in, please.

01:35:37.982 --> 01:35:40.610
Doctor, what can we do?

01:35:40.777 --> 01:35:44.327
Well, you're doing
all that can be done.

01:35:44.489 --> 01:35:45.706
How did it happen?

01:35:45.865 --> 01:35:47.082
Yeah.

01:35:47.242 --> 01:35:48.459
How did it happen?

01:35:48.618 --> 01:35:49.665
He was thrown overboard.

01:35:49.827 --> 01:35:51.795
Who would do such a thing?

01:35:51.955 --> 01:35:53.332
But look at him.

01:35:53.498 --> 01:35:55.717
He knows that
someone tried to drown him!

01:35:55.875 --> 01:35:57.297
His heart is broken.

01:35:57.460 --> 01:35:59.258
Doctor!

01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:02.094
You are not leaving?

01:36:02.257 --> 01:36:04.055
Perhaps we could
get him some broth.

01:36:04.217 --> 01:36:05.434
Some hot broth.

01:36:05.593 --> 01:36:07.140
Yes.

01:36:07.303 --> 01:36:08.475
You can give him some broth.

01:36:08.638 --> 01:36:09.639
It won't do any harm.

01:36:09.806 --> 01:36:11.149
Is that all?

01:36:11.307 --> 01:36:13.685
Yes, that's all.

01:36:13.851 --> 01:36:16.775
The man who saved him is dead.

01:36:21.818 --> 01:36:25.038
Did he say a man is dead?

01:36:39.043 --> 01:36:42.013
I know how you feel.

01:36:48.094 --> 01:36:49.596
No. You don't.

01:36:49.762 --> 01:36:51.435
You're like the others.

01:36:51.597 --> 01:36:53.474
You thought the captain was
justified in taking his knife

01:36:53.641 --> 01:36:56.235
away. right?

01:36:56.394 --> 01:36:57.941
You were the one who
felt sorry for the captain.

01:36:58.104 --> 01:37:01.404
That was you, wasn't it?

01:37:01.566 --> 01:37:03.568
Why can't we be
honest with each other?

01:37:03.735 --> 01:37:06.329
I don't know.

01:37:11.034 --> 01:37:12.627
Maybe we're afraid to be.

01:37:12.785 --> 01:37:14.207
Well, let's try.

01:37:14.370 --> 01:37:16.543
Maybe we'd better try.

01:37:17.415 --> 01:37:20.043
David.

01:37:20.209 --> 01:37:21.677
You say I hate your painting.

01:37:21.836 --> 01:37:23.258
Well, I do.

01:37:23.421 --> 01:37:25.173
Oh, God help me, but I do.

01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:26.432
I don't know why.

01:37:26.591 --> 01:37:27.888
You've said it.

01:37:28.051 --> 01:37:29.519
Maybe it's because I'm
not very good at it myself.

01:37:29.677 --> 01:37:33.056
Or maybe it's because it
means so much to you more than

01:37:33.222 --> 01:37:36.396
anything, more than even me.

01:37:38.102 --> 01:37:41.356
That's being honest, isn't it?

01:37:44.317 --> 01:37:47.742
Yes, that's honest.

01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:54.915
Well, I'll tell you
something that's even more sad.

01:37:56.245 --> 01:37:59.249
I can't be what
you want me to be.

01:37:59.415 --> 01:38:02.168
And I know you need someone
just to be there to deny

01:38:02.335 --> 01:38:05.464
herself for you.

01:38:06.214 --> 01:38:08.717
David, I wish I could
be like that, but I can't.

01:38:08.883 --> 01:38:10.351
I just can't.

01:38:10.510 --> 01:38:12.979
Jenny, I know you can.

01:38:14.806 --> 01:38:17.776
Well, it means
leaving me with nothing.

01:38:17.934 --> 01:38:19.436
You know?

01:38:19.602 --> 01:38:21.104
Nothing.

01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:22.738
Jenny, do you know what I need?

01:38:22.897 --> 01:38:24.240
I need something very simple.

01:38:24.399 --> 01:38:25.821
I need a woman.

01:38:25.983 --> 01:38:27.451
But that's so
difficult for you, isn't it?

01:38:27.610 --> 01:38:29.533
You're so full of competition.

01:38:29.695 --> 01:38:32.289
Do you know how empty and
frustrating it is to reach out

01:38:32.448 --> 01:38:35.827
for something and then
you find it isn't there?

01:38:35.993 --> 01:38:39.588
To feel that
someone is with you.

01:38:40.373 --> 01:38:42.546
David, don't
you think that I am?

01:38:42.708 --> 01:38:44.756
Don't you think that
I am in spite of myself?

01:38:44.919 --> 01:38:46.421
Haven't I tried everything?

01:38:46.587 --> 01:38:47.884
Yes, you have tried.

01:38:48.047 --> 01:38:50.095
You've split a gut.

01:38:50.258 --> 01:38:51.601
It's so hard for you.

01:38:51.759 --> 01:38:52.931
I know.

01:38:53.094 --> 01:38:56.348
It's so hard for both of us.

01:38:56.514 --> 01:38:58.516
All right, you say my
work is the most important

01:38:58.683 --> 01:38:59.980
thing in my life.

01:39:00.143 --> 01:39:01.440
It is.

01:39:01.602 --> 01:39:02.478
But that's the way I am.
I can't help it.

01:39:02.645 --> 01:39:04.325
And whoever shares my
life is going to have

01:39:04.355 --> 01:39:05.902
to put up with that.

01:39:06.065 --> 01:39:09.160
She's going to have
to live a life for me.

01:39:09.318 --> 01:39:13.368
Jenny, I know this
sounds selfish, but it's true.

01:39:22.206 --> 01:39:25.210
We're not gonna go
on together, are we?

01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:29.969
Are we?

01:39:37.263 --> 01:39:39.891
David?

01:39:42.518 --> 01:39:45.522
[knocking at door]

01:39:46.147 --> 01:39:48.991
Come in.

01:40:01.704 --> 01:40:03.672
I would have come to you.

01:40:03.831 --> 01:40:05.629
Well, they said you
weren't feeling well.

01:40:05.791 --> 01:40:08.135
I'm just tired, that's all.

01:40:08.294 --> 01:40:09.466
Were you sleeping?

01:40:09.629 --> 01:40:11.472
No.

01:40:11.631 --> 01:40:13.053
Don't you know it's
very unhealthy to sleep

01:40:13.216 --> 01:40:14.763
with your clothes on?

01:40:14.926 --> 01:40:16.269
Where are they?

01:40:16.427 --> 01:40:17.644
What?

01:40:17.803 --> 01:40:18.929
Where are they?

01:40:19.096 --> 01:40:20.268
What are you looking for?

01:40:20.431 --> 01:40:22.229
Stop riﬂing through my things.

01:40:22.391 --> 01:40:24.519
Here they are.

01:40:24.685 --> 01:40:26.608
Put them on.

01:40:26.771 --> 01:40:27.772
Come on.

01:40:27.939 --> 01:40:30.738
Put them on.

01:40:34.695 --> 01:40:37.869
And I'll read to
you until you sleep.

01:40:42.161 --> 01:40:45.916
Some pretty risque
literature you've got here.

01:40:47.416 --> 01:40:52.593
Natural Resistance
and Clinical Medicine.

01:40:53.923 --> 01:40:57.473
Researches on Rheumatism.

01:40:57.635 --> 01:41:00.309
Diseases...

01:41:20.324 --> 01:41:22.167
I don't know why I'm so tired.

01:41:22.326 --> 01:41:23.748
Why, yes, of course.

01:41:23.911 --> 01:41:26.539
Well, that's the way
it is sometimes.

01:41:34.088 --> 01:41:36.341
The woodcarver died.

01:41:36.507 --> 01:41:38.350
Yes, I know.

01:41:38.509 --> 01:41:40.102
I have been unable
to accept death.

01:41:40.261 --> 01:41:41.808
Never.

01:41:41.971 --> 01:41:43.894
No matter how many
times I've seen it.

01:41:44.056 --> 01:41:47.526
I always feel as
though I'm responsible.

01:41:48.269 --> 01:41:52.240
Now, let's see what
we've got here.

01:41:58.029 --> 01:42:00.157
The dissolute
Lady Chatterley sat

01:42:00.323 --> 01:42:03.418
waiting for the
gardener to enter.

01:42:03.576 --> 01:42:07.501
He entered, stopping for
a moment, sensing someone

01:42:07.663 --> 01:42:09.040
in the room.

01:42:09.206 --> 01:42:13.086
His muscles
sinewy in the moonlight.

01:42:13.252 --> 01:42:15.175
She spoke his name softly.

01:42:15.338 --> 01:42:17.887
The gardener went over to her.

01:42:18.049 --> 01:42:22.646
He kissed Lady Chatterley
with a kiss such as she had

01:42:22.803 --> 01:42:24.976
never been given before.

01:42:25.139 --> 01:42:28.268
Her arms were waiting
for him, both resisting

01:42:28.434 --> 01:42:29.981
and demanding.

01:42:30.144 --> 01:42:33.990
"Jonathan," she said,
"Jonathan, darling,

01:42:34.148 --> 01:42:35.866
you are violating me."

01:42:36.025 --> 01:42:37.993
Where did you get that?

01:42:45.076 --> 01:42:47.670
You're so strange.

01:42:47.828 --> 01:42:49.626
Sometimes you're so bitter.

01:42:49.789 --> 01:42:53.214
Then you're soft
and warm, like a child.

01:42:54.043 --> 01:42:56.466
I'm just a woman.

01:42:56.962 --> 01:42:59.590
Lie back.

01:43:01.592 --> 01:43:04.971
There's three days to Tenerife.

01:43:05.971 --> 01:43:08.349
I know.

01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:11.193
What will your treatment
be like for you there?

01:43:11.352 --> 01:43:12.604
Do you know?

01:43:12.770 --> 01:43:15.774
Will you be imprisoned?

01:43:16.732 --> 01:43:20.953
It will be some kind of
an imprisonment, I imagine.

01:43:21.112 --> 01:43:24.491
But you mustn't think of me
sleeping on a stone floor and

01:43:24.657 --> 01:43:27.752
living on bread and water.

01:43:27.910 --> 01:43:31.084
This is not my style.

01:43:36.544 --> 01:43:41.425
Now I'm going to read to
you from this book exactly

01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:43.058
the way it's written.

01:43:43.217 --> 01:43:46.141
If this doesn't put you
to sleep, nothing ever will.

01:43:46.303 --> 01:43:49.773
The liver is a large,
glandular organ irregularly

01:43:49.932 --> 01:43:53.482
shaped and of
reddish-brown color.

01:43:53.644 --> 01:43:54.144
Music

01:45:25.820 --> 01:45:27.367
Please come
with me to the table.

01:45:27.530 --> 01:45:28.577
No.

01:45:28.739 --> 01:45:29.831
I've done enough.

01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:31.492
You just have to take it
from here on by yourself.

01:45:31.659 --> 01:45:32.956
Are you sure I look all right?

01:45:33.118 --> 01:45:36.167
You look lovely.
Now, go on.

01:45:45.130 --> 01:45:49.385
Good evening.
Good evening.

01:46:04.149 --> 01:46:06.447
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:46:06.610 --> 01:46:11.616
Waiter, I would like one
bottle of champagne, please.

01:46:12.366 --> 01:46:14.960
- Would you like to join me?
- Why not?

01:46:15.119 --> 01:46:17.793
What are we celebrating?

01:46:24.628 --> 01:46:27.131
Quarrel?

01:46:27.298 --> 01:46:30.222
It's over.

01:46:31.302 --> 01:46:34.146
I'm sorry.

01:46:44.940 --> 01:46:46.738
Will you excuse me?

01:46:46.901 --> 01:46:50.075
I have to go to the bridge.

01:46:56.243 --> 01:46:58.837
Do you want to dance?

01:46:58.996 --> 01:47:00.998
No.

01:47:01.165 --> 01:47:03.259
No, not this time.

01:47:03.417 --> 01:47:06.842
Thank you.

01:47:07.004 --> 01:47:11.225
I think I'm going to go
to my cabin because for me,

01:47:11.383 --> 01:47:15.559
a little German music
goes a long way.

01:47:22.019 --> 01:47:23.771
Don't be embarrassed.

01:47:23.938 --> 01:47:27.488
Nobody is watching.

01:47:27.650 --> 01:47:30.494
Will I see you later?

01:47:30.653 --> 01:47:33.372
Later.

01:47:56.220 --> 01:47:58.143
Herr Freytag?

01:47:58.305 --> 01:48:00.808
Herr Freytag!

01:48:03.268 --> 01:48:07.273
I want to tell
you how sorry I am.

01:48:08.941 --> 01:48:12.991
I wanted to tell you
that with all my heart.

01:48:13.904 --> 01:48:15.656
Head?

01:48:15.823 --> 01:48:17.075
You have no hearts.

01:48:17.241 --> 01:48:19.118
Any of you.

01:48:19.284 --> 01:48:21.286
I'm sorry.

01:48:21.453 --> 01:48:24.297
I've no right
to be rude to you.

01:48:24.999 --> 01:48:28.629
I have no right to
be rude to anybody.

01:48:30.254 --> 01:48:33.383
You must be very much in
love with your wife to stand up

01:48:33.549 --> 01:48:36.769
for her that way.

01:48:40.681 --> 01:48:44.151
My wife and I are separated.

01:48:45.519 --> 01:48:46.862
Yes.

01:48:47.021 --> 01:48:50.321
Yes!

01:48:51.900 --> 01:48:57.282
I-I thought I could face what
we had to go through after we

01:48:57.448 --> 01:49:00.167
were married.

01:49:00.325 --> 01:49:03.249
I couldn't.

01:49:03.412 --> 01:49:05.665
I wasn't ready to give
up my position because

01:49:05.831 --> 01:49:09.461
of my employer's prejudices.

01:49:09.626 --> 01:49:12.505
My family talked
to me about it.

01:49:12.671 --> 01:49:20.305
My friends.
My dear friends.

01:49:21.889 --> 01:49:27.111
So I panicked.
Panicked!

01:49:27.269 --> 01:49:32.992
I asked my firm to
transfer me to Mexico.

01:49:33.150 --> 01:49:37.326
You'll never
believe what I did.

01:49:37.488 --> 01:49:41.538
I wrote a letter.

01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:49.700
Dear Marianne: We
can't go on together.

01:49:54.088 --> 01:49:57.058
I've imagined her face
a thousand times

01:49:57.216 --> 01:50:01.312
when she got the letter.

01:50:02.179 --> 01:50:06.184
That face has
followed me everywhere.

01:50:08.811 --> 01:50:12.907
Now I'm going back.

01:50:14.024 --> 01:50:18.700
I don't even know where she is.

01:50:19.655 --> 01:50:22.750
But I've got to find her.

01:50:22.908 --> 01:50:29.336
Plead with her to understand.

01:50:30.582 --> 01:50:33.756
To forgive me.

01:50:34.753 --> 01:50:39.384
If she cares for
you, she'll understand.

01:50:40.717 --> 01:50:42.936
Don't you see?

01:50:43.095 --> 01:50:48.522
Even if she does, I
know I'll never forget.

01:50:50.853 --> 01:50:54.653
I wrote that letter.

01:50:57.151 --> 01:50:59.654
Listen to that music, Glocken.

01:50:59.820 --> 01:51:02.494
Now try to tell me you
don't react to that music.

01:51:02.656 --> 01:51:04.624
Schmaltz.

01:51:04.783 --> 01:51:06.751
Tell me, Glocken, now honestly.

01:51:06.910 --> 01:51:09.754
When you hear that music
wherever you are don't you have

01:51:09.913 --> 01:51:13.588
a special feeling
about being a German?

01:51:13.750 --> 01:51:16.094
I'll tell you now, honestly.

01:51:16.253 --> 01:51:18.927
When I hear that music
wherever I am I have a special

01:51:19.089 --> 01:51:22.889
feeling about being a dwarf.

01:51:23.927 --> 01:51:26.350
I remember being thousands
of miles from home

01:51:26.513 --> 01:51:28.686
in a theater in New York.

01:51:28.849 --> 01:51:30.476
They put on a picture
of the funeral

01:51:30.642 --> 01:51:33.771
of the Kaiserin Viktoria.

01:51:33.937 --> 01:51:35.655
That good woman.

01:51:35.814 --> 01:51:39.739
How much she
meant to all of us.

01:51:40.861 --> 01:51:43.489
You are German, aren't you?

01:51:43.655 --> 01:51:48.877
You are the most
German person I have ever met.

01:51:49.036 --> 01:51:51.084
I want to show you something.

01:51:51.246 --> 01:51:53.965
I take it out every once
in a while and look at it

01:51:54.124 --> 01:51:57.719
when I want to feel good.

01:51:58.587 --> 01:52:01.431
Why, the Order
of the Iron Cross!

01:52:01.590 --> 01:52:04.764
Second class.

01:52:04.927 --> 01:52:08.101
And a war hero, besides.

01:52:08.972 --> 01:52:13.694
You may be the biggest
fool on this whole boat.

01:52:16.021 --> 01:52:18.991
Why do you say that?

01:52:19.149 --> 01:52:22.323
Where have you
been during this voyage?

01:52:22.986 --> 01:52:24.363
Do you think this
boat is a cross section

01:52:24.529 --> 01:52:26.497
of the German people?

01:52:26.657 --> 01:52:28.079
No!

01:52:28.242 --> 01:52:31.587
You don't know the average
German the way I know him.

01:52:31.745 --> 01:52:34.999
The people that produced
Goethe, Beethoven and Bach

01:52:35.165 --> 01:52:36.963
are not to be sneezed at.

01:52:37.125 --> 01:52:39.048
Fifty percent of the
people who produced Goethe,

01:52:39.211 --> 01:52:41.964
Beethoven and Bach voted for
Rieber's party last week.

01:52:42.130 --> 01:52:44.258
Forty four percent.

01:52:44.424 --> 01:52:47.678
You are blind!
You're absolutely blind!

01:52:47.844 --> 01:52:50.563
You can't see what's going
on in front of your own face.

01:52:50.722 --> 01:52:53.191
What do you mean?

01:52:53.350 --> 01:52:56.229
You mean this
business about the Jews?

01:52:56.395 --> 01:52:58.443
You don't understand us.

01:52:58.605 --> 01:53:01.449
The German Jew is
something special.

01:53:01.608 --> 01:53:05.454
We are Germans
first and Jews second.

01:53:05.612 --> 01:53:07.990
We have done so
much for Germany.

01:53:08.156 --> 01:53:10.250
Germany has
done so much for us.

01:53:10.409 --> 01:53:11.877
A little patience.

01:53:12.035 --> 01:53:13.287
A little goodwill.

01:53:13.453 --> 01:53:14.705
It works itself out.

01:53:14.871 --> 01:53:17.795
Listen, there are nearly
a million Jews in Germany.

01:53:17.958 --> 01:53:20.006
What are they going to do?

01:53:20.168 --> 01:53:23.342
Kill all of us?

01:53:28.927 --> 01:53:33.353
Karl, if you will excuse
me, I want to dance with a most

01:53:33.515 --> 01:53:36.610
charming lady.

01:53:42.482 --> 01:53:45.406
Might I have the
honor of this dance?

01:53:45.694 --> 01:53:46.194
Music

01:54:14.765 --> 01:54:16.767
Give me some money
or I will kill you.

01:54:16.933 --> 01:54:19.106
Are you out of your mind?

01:54:19.269 --> 01:54:20.521
I will kill you.

01:54:20.687 --> 01:54:21.779
Johann!

01:54:21.938 --> 01:54:22.905
That's God's judgment.

01:54:23.065 --> 01:54:24.112
I don't want to
hear that anymore.

01:54:24.274 --> 01:54:26.072
Don't you think I
know how you've treated me?

01:54:26.234 --> 01:54:29.408
Don't you think I
know how you've cheated me?

01:54:29.571 --> 01:54:31.118
Where is it?

01:54:31.281 --> 01:54:32.874
Where's the money?

01:54:33.033 --> 01:54:36.037
Top drawer.

01:54:42.459 --> 01:54:44.553
[knocking at door]

01:54:44.711 --> 01:54:47.510
Come in.

01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:52.599
I have money.

01:54:59.518 --> 01:55:01.862
Come here.

01:55:02.521 --> 01:55:04.865
Come on.

01:55:08.860 --> 01:55:11.659
Put out my cigarette.

01:55:28.088 --> 01:55:33.390
Tell me, am I
your very first girl?

01:55:35.220 --> 01:55:37.314
You are shaking.

01:55:37.472 --> 01:55:40.817
There is nothing
to be afraid of.

01:55:46.481 --> 01:55:48.779
No.

01:56:02.038 --> 01:56:04.507
The first time.

01:56:06.877 --> 01:56:11.633
The first time
is very important.

01:56:18.305 --> 01:56:18.805
Music

01:56:59.012 --> 01:57:01.060
Stop it! stop in
Stop it!

01:57:01.223 --> 01:57:02.623
I'm just teaching
the lady flamenco.

01:57:02.766 --> 01:57:05.235
Keep your hands
off her, you pimp.

01:57:11.483 --> 01:57:13.451
Big hero.

01:57:41.263 --> 01:57:44.312
I'm sorry.

01:57:45.559 --> 01:57:46.171
[singing]

01:58:12.419 --> 01:58:16.174
I don't believe you're
quite sober, Mrs. Treadwell.

01:58:17.799 --> 01:58:22.225
What could give
you that impression?

01:58:34.357 --> 01:58:38.703
God, he stalks them
like a mountain lion.

01:58:39.404 --> 01:58:42.624
Did you see the
makeup on those girls?

01:58:42.782 --> 01:58:45.831
Do men really
find that attractive?

01:58:45.994 --> 01:58:49.043
Some apparently do.

01:58:50.790 --> 01:58:55.341
I would think that
men would like to know

01:58:55.503 --> 01:58:58.552
what they were kissing.

01:59:05.180 --> 01:59:08.980
I would like to know
what it is like to kiss you.

01:59:22.739 --> 01:59:24.540
I have been looking at
you, thinking about you

01:59:24.616 --> 01:59:25.913
for a long time.

01:59:26.076 --> 01:59:27.293
You never notice me.

01:59:27.452 --> 01:59:28.704
Why not?

01:59:28.870 --> 01:59:29.962
Now you will not kiss me?

01:59:30.121 --> 01:59:31.247
Why not?

01:59:31.414 --> 01:59:32.711
Do you want me
to say I love you?

01:59:32.874 --> 01:59:34.467
I never knew what
people meant by that.

01:59:34.626 --> 01:59:35.798
Don't say it.

01:59:35.960 --> 01:59:37.303
I can't bear the sound of it.

01:59:37.462 --> 01:59:42.138
Then why did you lead
me on during the trip?

01:59:42.300 --> 01:59:46.931
You never considered my
feelings at all, did you?

01:59:47.597 --> 01:59:52.319
No, and I'm sorry for that.

01:59:52.477 --> 01:59:54.980
Mrs. Treadwell, I'm only
a third-grade officer

01:59:55.146 --> 01:59:56.944
on a second-rate ship,

01:59:57.107 --> 01:59:59.405
but it gives me an
opportunity to observe people.

01:59:59.567 --> 02:00:03.413
I've seen women like you,
Forty-six-year-old women

02:00:03.571 --> 02:00:05.494
who are still coquettes.

02:00:05.657 --> 02:00:09.662
They travel on boats often.
Always searching for something.

02:00:09.828 --> 02:00:11.876
Do you know where
that searching ends?

02:00:12.038 --> 02:00:15.918
In a nightclub with a paid
escort who tells you the lies

02:00:16.084 --> 02:00:19.304
you must hear.

02:00:20.380 --> 02:00:24.931
You are a most
mundane, ordinary man.

02:00:27.595 --> 02:00:31.441
How extraordinary that a man
like you should say things

02:00:31.599 --> 02:00:35.069
like this to me.

02:00:37.605 --> 02:00:40.700
Probably true.

02:00:46.364 --> 02:00:48.287
I think this evening's
festivities have come

02:00:48.450 --> 02:00:50.999
to an end.

02:00:52.579 --> 02:00:54.673
I shall see you to your door.

02:00:54.831 --> 02:00:57.459
It's quite unnecessary.

02:00:57.625 --> 02:01:00.595
I'll find my own way.

02:01:07.719 --> 02:01:08.331
[singing]

02:01:34.329 --> 02:01:35.421
Darling?

02:01:35.580 --> 02:01:36.627
Yeah.

02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:39.885
I didn't know
there was a Frau Rieber.

02:01:40.752 --> 02:01:42.925
What do you mean,
a Frau Rieber?

02:01:43.087 --> 02:01:46.591
The purser told me you sent
a cable to Frankfurt addressed

02:01:46.758 --> 02:01:49.386
to Frau Rieber.

02:01:49.552 --> 02:01:51.054
I did not mention it
because I could

02:01:51.221 --> 02:01:52.689
not bear the humiliation.

02:01:52.847 --> 02:01:54.474
It is the tragedy of my life.

02:01:54.641 --> 02:01:56.109
She will not let me go.

02:01:56.267 --> 02:01:58.736
I must go on supporting
her and the three children.

02:01:58.895 --> 02:02:01.444
There are three child ren?

02:02:01.606 --> 02:02:02.949
They have no
understanding of me.

02:02:03.107 --> 02:02:04.575
I've no understanding of them.

02:02:04.734 --> 02:02:07.362
They hang on.
They hang on.

02:02:07.529 --> 02:02:08.781
They suck the
life's blood out of me.

02:02:08.947 --> 02:02:11.575
They will not let go.
They will not let go.

02:02:11.741 --> 02:02:14.460
I am a vital, passionate man.

02:02:14.619 --> 02:02:18.374
I need love.
I must have love.

02:02:18.540 --> 02:02:22.511
Say you understand.
You must understand.

02:02:22.669 --> 02:02:25.092
I understand.

02:02:31.344 --> 02:02:33.938
Now, look, I bought
you a bottle of champagne.

02:02:34.097 --> 02:02:37.192
A pack of them Sultana
cigarettes and two margaritas.

02:02:37.350 --> 02:02:39.102
When are we gonna get together?

02:02:39.269 --> 02:02:40.646
You have been
drinking too much.

02:02:40.812 --> 02:02:42.530
I think I will go now.

02:02:42.689 --> 02:02:44.032
Tonight.

02:02:44.190 --> 02:02:45.533
Not tonight.

02:02:45.692 --> 02:02:46.818
Tonight I am tired.

02:02:46.985 --> 02:02:49.613
Tonight.

02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:51.748
Very well.

02:02:51.906 --> 02:02:54.000
Just let go of my arm.

02:02:55.827 --> 02:02:57.124
Hey.

02:02:57.287 --> 02:03:00.461
What's your cabin number?

02:03:00.623 --> 02:03:03.547
Number 14.

02:03:07.255 --> 02:03:09.474
I thought you weren't
bothering with that cheapskate.

02:03:09.632 --> 02:03:11.179
I have planned
something interesting

02:03:11.342 --> 02:03:13.015
for that cheapskate.

02:03:13.177 --> 02:03:15.930
I gave him the cabin of
that snotty American bitch,

02:03:16.097 --> 02:03:18.896
Mrs. Treadwell.

02:03:21.436 --> 02:03:21.936
Music

02:05:32.275 --> 02:05:34.323
I think you are mad.

02:05:34.485 --> 02:05:36.658
I made some inquiries.

02:05:36.821 --> 02:05:39.074
They would let me
stay on the island.

02:05:39.240 --> 02:05:41.493
I would be able
to take care of her.

02:05:41.659 --> 02:05:43.912
I understand your
feeling, her helplessness.

02:05:44.078 --> 02:05:45.921
But to give up everything.

02:05:46.080 --> 02:05:48.128
What would I be giving up?

02:05:49.208 --> 02:05:50.710
What would I be giving up?

02:05:50.877 --> 02:05:52.003
Your life!

02:05:52.170 --> 02:05:53.342
My life.

02:05:53.504 --> 02:05:55.381
My life is obligations.

02:05:55.548 --> 02:05:58.267
Obligation to nothing
that's real to me.

02:05:58.426 --> 02:06:01.896
This woman over there in
the cabin, she's real to me.

02:06:02.055 --> 02:06:04.604
It sounds strange.

02:06:04.766 --> 02:06:07.736
But she's the only real
thing that has happened to me.

02:06:07.894 --> 02:06:10.363
You have heard of shipboard
romances, haven't you?

02:06:10.521 --> 02:06:12.023
She's sold you a bill of goods,

02:06:12.190 --> 02:06:13.533
and you've fallen for it.

02:06:13.691 --> 02:06:15.364
I can see it if you can't.

02:06:15.526 --> 02:06:16.948
She wants her precious needle.

02:06:17.111 --> 02:06:18.363
She doesn't want you.

02:06:18.529 --> 02:06:20.406
This may be true.

02:06:20.573 --> 02:06:24.168
If this is true.

02:06:26.245 --> 02:06:30.466
When I had my heart attack,
there was a dream I had.

02:06:30.625 --> 02:06:32.502
You can talk about death.

02:06:32.668 --> 02:06:35.467
I've seen it many
times as a doctor.

02:06:35.630 --> 02:06:37.550
But you never know what
it's like until it almost

02:06:37.673 --> 02:06:40.768
happens to you.

02:06:43.387 --> 02:06:47.358
I dreamed I had already died.

02:06:47.517 --> 02:06:49.269
I dreamed I was in a box.

02:06:49.435 --> 02:06:53.030
The sweat broke
out all over my body.

02:06:53.189 --> 02:06:59.538
I wanted to cry out, I
can't be dead, I haven't lived!

02:07:00.321 --> 02:07:03.120
Who has?

02:07:03.866 --> 02:07:06.164
Do you think this
woman is the answer, Willie?

02:07:06.327 --> 02:07:07.954
A woman like this.

02:07:08.121 --> 02:07:09.373
All she's been through.

02:07:09.539 --> 02:07:10.791
She has seen everything.

02:07:10.957 --> 02:07:14.052
There are no
surprises left for her.

02:07:14.836 --> 02:07:18.761
Even if it's love, Willie,
I hope we can deny the myth

02:07:18.923 --> 02:07:22.177
that love lasts.

02:07:26.514 --> 02:07:27.014
Music

02:07:31.727 --> 02:07:36.654
You are not young,
Mrs. Treadwell.

02:07:36.816 --> 02:07:40.992
You have not
been young for years.

02:07:47.326 --> 02:07:53.459
Behind those old eyes,
you hide a 16-year-old heart.

02:07:54.500 --> 02:07:57.549
Poor fool.

02:08:01.215 --> 02:08:05.345
Is that what men
really find attractive?

02:08:27.366 --> 02:08:30.495
Well, baby.

02:08:30.661 --> 02:08:34.711
You just haven't
managed to grow up.

02:08:35.208 --> 02:08:40.465
Mrs. Treadwell of
Murray Hill, Virginia.

02:08:42.298 --> 02:08:44.426
NOW!

02:08:46.177 --> 02:08:50.273
You can paint
your toenails green.

02:08:55.519 --> 02:09:00.400
You know how it
ends, don't you?

02:09:01.275 --> 02:09:03.994
Alone.

02:09:04.946 --> 02:09:10.749
Sitting in a cafe
with a paid escort.

02:09:33.266 --> 02:09:35.268
Let me go.

02:09:36.102 --> 02:09:38.275
Let me go.

02:09:49.323 --> 02:09:51.917
Mrs. Treadwell'?

02:09:53.452 --> 02:09:55.375
Excuse me.

02:09:55.538 --> 02:09:57.165
That greaser told me Cabin 14.

02:09:57.331 --> 02:09:59.004
Excuse me.

02:10:00.084 --> 02:10:01.836
Excuse me.

02:10:02.003 --> 02:10:04.051
Get out!

02:10:04.672 --> 02:10:07.016
Get out!

02:10:07.883 --> 02:10:10.762
Get out!

02:10:13.431 --> 02:10:15.354
I'm sorry, I truly am sorry.

02:10:15.516 --> 02:10:16.859
I didn't know it...

02:10:17.018 --> 02:10:18.144
Pig!

02:10:18.311 --> 02:10:19.358
Hey, what the hell?

02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:20.612
Go on.

02:10:20.771 --> 02:10:22.239
Get out.

02:10:22.773 --> 02:10:24.025
Get out.

02:10:24.191 --> 02:10:25.659
Get out!

02:10:26.444 --> 02:10:28.538
Get out!

02:11:09.362 --> 02:11:11.239
You were sleeping.

02:11:11.405 --> 02:11:14.500
I know.

02:11:16.786 --> 02:11:19.756
You cried out again.

02:11:20.873 --> 02:11:23.672
Did I?

02:11:24.168 --> 02:11:25.841
What is it?

02:11:26.003 --> 02:11:28.597
It's nothing.

02:11:31.258 --> 02:11:32.931
It had to be something.

02:11:33.094 --> 02:11:35.768
It was ridiculous.

02:11:41.602 --> 02:11:43.855
Tell me.

02:11:50.694 --> 02:11:53.493
Promise you won't laugh.

02:11:54.156 --> 02:11:56.375
I won't laugh.

02:11:57.660 --> 02:11:59.461
It's something I saw
the time I went to Taxco.

02:11:59.495 --> 02:12:02.499
A flash passing on the bus.

02:12:02.665 --> 02:12:04.292
It was a man and a woman.

02:12:04.458 --> 02:12:05.960
A crowd had gathered.

02:12:06.127 --> 02:12:07.629
They were staggering
and swaying.

02:12:07.795 --> 02:12:10.173
I thought they were dancing.

02:12:10.756 --> 02:12:12.178
The man had his hand
raised and there was

02:12:12.341 --> 02:12:14.139
a long knife in it.

02:12:14.301 --> 02:12:16.645
The woman's breast
and stomach were pierced.

02:12:16.804 --> 02:12:20.229
The blood was so thick her
skirt was sticking to her legs.

02:12:20.391 --> 02:12:23.611
She was beating
him with a stone.

02:12:25.896 --> 02:12:29.776
I'll never forget
the look on their faces.

02:12:30.526 --> 02:12:32.574
It wasn't all hatred.

02:12:32.736 --> 02:12:36.491
It was like there was some
great bond between them

02:12:36.657 --> 02:12:40.662
in that hatred.

02:12:40.828 --> 02:12:44.253
And then they struck again.

02:12:46.709 --> 02:12:52.261
I always dream about it
in some grotesque variation.

02:12:52.423 --> 02:12:55.552
Tonight I was one
of the watchers, as

02:12:55.718 --> 02:12:58.892
if I were at a play.

02:13:00.264 --> 02:13:02.813
Then something happened.

02:13:10.274 --> 02:13:12.276
What happened?

02:13:12.443 --> 02:13:15.743
The features changed.

02:13:17.698 --> 02:13:19.416
And?

02:13:19.575 --> 02:13:22.954
David, the faces
were yours and mine.

02:13:30.711 --> 02:13:33.885
Good evening, doctor.

02:13:43.933 --> 02:13:46.777
Night, doctor.

02:14:19.510 --> 02:14:20.010
Music

02:14:41.407 --> 02:14:46.208
[shouting]

02:15:37.129 --> 02:15:39.632
Thank you for
bringing us home, capitan.

02:15:39.798 --> 02:15:44.395
The cuisine and the
accommodations were superb.

02:16:11.080 --> 02:16:13.833
They've come for me?

02:16:19.213 --> 02:16:22.342
For me, the voyage is over.

02:16:24.259 --> 02:16:28.514
I have here an order for
something that will help you.

02:16:28.681 --> 02:16:31.480
Any doctor will accept it.

02:16:49.660 --> 02:16:52.209
Oh, Willie.

02:16:52.370 --> 02:16:55.045
You try so hard.

02:17:06.218 --> 02:17:08.687
My darling.

02:17:08.846 --> 02:17:11.690
My love.

02:17:13.183 --> 02:17:18.610
For once, let's
kiss in broad daylight.

02:17:37.082 --> 02:17:39.709
Bye.

02:19:42.290 --> 02:19:44.760
I think we ought to be
able to reach Bremerhaven

02:19:44.918 --> 02:19:48.218
by Thursday morning.

02:19:51.717 --> 02:19:56.143
Willie, you're drinking
up my best Cognac.

02:19:56.305 --> 02:19:58.774
Not that I mind, but
that isn't the thing you

02:19:58.932 --> 02:20:00.934
should be doing, is it?

02:20:01.101 --> 02:20:04.321
You shouldn't be doing this.

02:20:05.272 --> 02:20:07.650
I know you're
still thinking about her.

02:20:07.816 --> 02:20:10.114
She'll be all right.

02:20:10.277 --> 02:20:13.827
By now, I'll guarantee she's
found someone to help her.

02:20:13.989 --> 02:20:15.912
A woman like that
always finds someone.

02:20:16.074 --> 02:20:18.827
Shut up!

02:20:35.844 --> 02:20:38.688
Willie.

02:20:38.847 --> 02:20:42.772
That's a hell of a way to
waste good brandy, Willie.

02:20:44.227 --> 02:20:47.572
When I think of the
things I've seen on this ship.

02:20:47.731 --> 02:20:49.108
The stupid cruelties.

02:20:49.274 --> 02:20:50.776
The vanities.

02:20:50.943 --> 02:20:52.490
We talk about values?

02:20:52.653 --> 02:20:54.576
There's no values.

02:20:54.738 --> 02:20:58.163
The dung we base our lives on.

02:20:58.325 --> 02:21:00.168
She looked into
the garbage dump.

02:21:00.327 --> 02:21:02.750
She did something about it.

02:21:02.913 --> 02:21:06.008
We are the intelligent,
civilized people who carry out

02:21:06.166 --> 02:21:08.009
orders we are given.

02:21:08.168 --> 02:21:11.422
No matter what they may be.

02:21:12.464 --> 02:21:16.469
Our biggest mission in
life is to avoid being fools.

02:21:19.429 --> 02:21:22.683
And we wind up being
the biggest fools of all.

02:21:22.849 --> 02:21:25.602
Why didn't I go?

02:21:29.898 --> 02:21:33.118
[knocking at door] Come in.

02:21:34.277 --> 02:21:36.871
Herr doctor, Frau Lutz
wants to see you.

02:21:37.030 --> 02:21:40.204
Her daughter Elsa
is not feeling well.

02:21:40.826 --> 02:21:43.045
I'm coming.

02:21:43.203 --> 02:21:44.329
To hell with them, Willie.

02:21:44.496 --> 02:21:45.622
You rest here.

02:21:45.789 --> 02:21:46.836
You don't look well.

02:21:46.999 --> 02:21:49.422
You should see
the way you look.

02:22:04.141 --> 02:22:05.262
That is exactly what I mean.

02:22:05.308 --> 02:22:10.485
[knocking at door]

02:22:10.647 --> 02:22:12.365
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

02:22:12.524 --> 02:22:13.741
You called me?

02:22:13.900 --> 02:22:16.949
Doctor, can you
give Elsa a purge?

02:22:21.992 --> 02:22:24.962
Take two of those
before you retire.

02:22:25.120 --> 02:22:29.045
Doctor, aren't you
going to take her temperature?

02:22:36.590 --> 02:22:39.560
I think he's been drinking.

02:23:38.985 --> 02:23:40.953
[screaming]

02:23:49.996 --> 02:23:50.496
Music

02:28:07.045 --> 02:28:10.049
I can just hear you saying,

02:28:10.215 --> 02:28:14.015
"What has all this
to do with us?"

02:28:15.178 --> 02:28:18.148
Nothing.

02:28:23.019 --> 02:28:26.019
Music
