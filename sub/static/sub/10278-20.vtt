Abby, your mother needs hospitalization,
not a road trip with you and Carter!

Yeah, Luka. We're doing it
for the fun of it.

00:13.318 --> 00:17.134
- She's been suicidal?
- If you count attempted suicide.

00:18.054 --> 00:20.846
Maggie? Maggie, can you hear me?

00:20.847 --> 00:21.847
Maggie!

00:22.148 --> 00:23.775
- Did she take something?
- I don't know. Sit her up.

00:23.776 --> 00:24.660
She took something.

00:24.661 --> 00:26.623
- Where'd she get it from?
- Call the paramedics!

00:27.373 --> 00:29.671
Breaths are shallow,
but I think her airway's clear.

00:29.958 --> 00:31.329
- She's seizing!
- Watch the tube!

00:31.330 --> 00:33.035
- Somebody help me keep her head steady.
- Hold on, hold on.

00:51.626 --> 00:54.200
Hi, I'm looking for Carl Ferris.
He's not in his room.

00:54.379 --> 00:56.123
How much longer?

00:56.298 --> 00:57.876
Trudy!

00:58.092 --> 01:00.797
- Where's the damn ambulance?!
- They're on their way.

01:00.970 --> 01:04.090
- What's the problem?
- Nothing to concern yourself with.

01:04.307 --> 01:06.098
- I'm a doctor.
- Then get in here!

01:06.267 --> 01:08.888
I think this guy's having
a heart attack!

01:09.061 --> 01:11.849
Make way! Doctor coming in!
Bernice, shake a leg.

01:12.023 --> 01:14.349
Mr. Ferris?
Are you having pain in your chest?

01:14.526 --> 01:17.978
Well, he says yes.
It's like someone's squeezing his heart.

01:18.155 --> 01:21.738
No, no, no. It's more like
he's been punched in the chest.

01:21.951 --> 01:24.110
- When did it start?
- A few hours ago.

01:24.329 --> 01:27.034
Give me your stethoscope.
Let's sit him up. Here we go.

01:27.207 --> 01:28.701
Easy.

01:28.917 --> 01:30.790
- He needs oxygen.
- We're board and care.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.039
We don't have any.

01:32.211 --> 01:35.497
- Jerry, I need your oxygen.
- Get your hands off that!

01:35.674 --> 01:38.343
That's mine!
How am I supposed to breathe now?

01:39.386 --> 01:41.628
- He's in CHF.
- Oh, CHF.

01:41.806 --> 01:43.882
- What's that?
- Congestive heart failure.

01:44.058 --> 01:46.431
- I just take blood pressures.
- I know CPR.

01:46.603 --> 01:49.937
- Dr. Benton?
- He's in rapid A-fib. Let's start a line.

01:50.148 --> 01:51.856
Oh, my God. Look at this.

01:52.025 --> 01:54.149
We can't take orders
unless you stay with us.

01:54.320 --> 01:57.154
All right.
Five liters O-2 on a nasal cannula.

01:57.322 --> 01:58.900
Let's get him on the gurney.

01:59.074 --> 02:01.530
- Hang in there, Carl!
- Yeah, you're gonna be fine.

02:01.702 --> 02:05.617
His lungs are wet. We need to treat
as failure. Nitro spray in five minutes.

02:05.790 --> 02:09.455
Forty of Lasix and titrate up to 10 of
morphine. Keep his pressure above 100.

02:13.465 --> 02:15.672
- Lasix and MS.
- What's happening?

02:15.843 --> 02:17.752
You've got fluid in your lungs.

02:17.929 --> 02:21.713
- Ten of morphine.
- This might make you drowsy, okay?

02:21.891 --> 02:23.848
Pressure's holding at 110.
Pulse down to 100.

02:24.018 --> 02:27.268
- Am I gonna make it?
- You're doing fine. You're gonna be-

02:31.193 --> 02:33.518
- Anybody hurt?
- No, I don't think so.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.273
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

02:37.283 --> 02:39.157
- What happened?
- He came out of nowhere.

02:39.327 --> 02:41.569
- Sir, does your neck hurt?
- A little.

02:41.746 --> 02:44.368
- He pulled out right in front of me.
- I didn't see you.

02:44.541 --> 02:47.115
- Don't move your head.
- I had my lights and sirens on.

02:47.336 --> 02:50.669
- I'll go call another rig.
- No, we'll take him with us.

I never wash my hair. It helps.

03:50.446 --> 03:55.155
You shouldn't wash your hair every day.
It gets rid of the natural oils.

03:55.326 --> 03:56.821
Hi, Mom.

03:56.995 --> 04:00.530
- Abby. What are you doing here?
- I'm on a break.

04:00.707 --> 04:04.622
If you comb it too much,
you'll damage the ends.

04:04.795 --> 04:07.167
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

04:07.339 --> 04:13.080
- Now it's full of static electricity.
- Winona, your hair looks fine. Really.

04:14.388 --> 04:16.512
I don't think she knows where she is.

04:16.683 --> 04:19.137
Time for your meds, Maggie.

04:19.728 --> 04:22.219
I think Winona needs to go
to the bathroom.

04:22.397 --> 04:26.692
- She gets agitated when she has to pee.
- Thanks.

04:27.194 --> 04:30.315
- You need to use the bathroom, Winona?
- I need to fix my hair.

04:30.490 --> 04:33.609
Okay. I'll be right back.

04:35.786 --> 04:38.704
You're gonna have to stay here
for a little while.

04:38.873 --> 04:41.993
They're keeping you on a 90-day hold.
I'm sorry.

04:42.169 --> 04:43.663
No.

04:43.837 --> 04:49.674
No, it's me. I should never have
put you through all of that. It's me.

04:50.303 --> 04:52.296
I'm sorry.

04:54.224 --> 04:57.142
Trauma panel, C-spine, chest and pelvis.
Prep the left chest.

04:57.311 --> 04:59.552
- Where does it hurt?
- My chest and stomach.

04:59.729 --> 05:01.389
- Any headache or neck pain?
- No.

05:01.564 --> 05:03.059
No loss of consciousness.

05:03.233 --> 05:05.309
- Someone you'd like us to call?
- My mom.

05:05.486 --> 05:07.478
Let's infiltrate with lidocaine, Malucci.

05:07.655 --> 05:09.564
- Where you going?
- I'll be right back.

05:09.740 --> 05:14.319
CBC, chem panel, cardiac enzymes,
12-lead EKG and a portable chest.

05:14.496 --> 05:16.868
He was in A-fib
with a rapid ventricular response.

05:17.040 --> 05:20.492
- Heart rate's 88, irregular.
- He's in CHF. How about some Lasix?

05:20.669 --> 05:22.995
We gave him 40.
How you doing, Mr. Ferris?

05:23.172 --> 05:25.294
- You tell me.
- Don't worry. You'll be okay.

05:25.465 --> 05:29.546
I've gotta go work on the crash victim.
Dr. Kovac will take care of you, okay?

05:29.720 --> 05:32.212
Let me see that EKG
as soon as it comes back.

05:32.390 --> 05:34.513
Lidocaine's on,
second liter of saline is up.

05:34.684 --> 05:37.436
- Do the ultrasound, Malucci.
- Pulse ox, 89 on two liters.

05:37.604 --> 05:39.514
Up it to five. 32 French. Thank you.

05:39.690 --> 05:42.775
Open a chest-tube tray.
Set up Thora-Seal to low suction.

05:42.943 --> 05:46.313
Get serial crits, due 20 minutes, okay?

05:47.073 --> 05:48.104
Damn it!

05:48.283 --> 05:49.446
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

05:49.618 --> 05:51.277
Pulse ox down to 85.

05:52.078 --> 05:54.035
- Hurt yourself?
- No.

05:54.205 --> 05:57.206
- I can give it a try if you want.
- I'm fine. Open another tube.

05:58.710 --> 06:03.289
Shove this under the desk. It's
Mr. Simpson's. You don't wanna know.

06:03.466 --> 06:06.218
Abby, shouldn't you be
at the courthouse?

06:06.386 --> 06:09.303
Your mother was just transported
to her commitment hearing.

06:09.472 --> 06:12.676
- Aren't you supposed to testify?
- What commitment hearing?

06:12.851 --> 06:14.844
State Attorney's Office
should have called.

06:15.020 --> 06:16.264
Well, nobody called me.

06:16.438 --> 06:20.981
Okay. Your mother has contested
her certificate of commitment.

06:21.151 --> 06:24.568
By law, she is entitled to a hearing
in front of a judge.

06:24.739 --> 06:27.277
- And, what, he could release her?
- Technically.

06:27.450 --> 06:31.662
Attempted suicide is a good argument for
a 90-day hold, but since you witnessed-

06:31.830 --> 06:35.579
- When is this happening?
15, county courthouse.

06:35.751 --> 06:38.207
- Tube placement looks good.
- Pressure's up to 120.

06:38.379 --> 06:40.668
I'll meet you at the elevator.
How we doing?

06:40.840 --> 06:42.631
No chest pain after two more nitros.

06:42.800 --> 06:45.920
- Where are you admitting him?
- He's fifth in line for Tele admit.

06:46.095 --> 06:47.376
How long will that take?

06:47.555 --> 06:50.260
Sometimes we rule out Ml,
send them home.

06:50.433 --> 06:53.103
He spent two days in the ER last time.

06:53.270 --> 06:58.645
It's okay. I'll sort this out and get you
a bed as soon as I'm done in the O.R.

06:58.818 --> 07:01.938
- Thank you, Peter.
- Sure.

07:02.113 --> 07:05.981
She sat there and let me apologize to her,
and she knew she was going to court.

07:06.159 --> 07:07.818
She didn't wanna get you involved.

07:07.994 --> 07:10.033
Or doesn't want me
to testify against her.

07:10.205 --> 07:11.367
- Are you?
- I don't know.

07:11.539 --> 07:14.706
I have to find this state's attorney,
whoever that is.

07:15.794 --> 07:17.337
- I'll go with you.
- No.

07:17.504 --> 07:20.210
- I can get somebody to cover.
- I can't wait.

07:20.383 --> 07:22.376
You shouldn't have
to do this by yourself.

07:22.552 --> 07:24.675
I shouldn't have to do this at all.

07:24.846 --> 07:28.975
- You'd rather Carter go with you?
- What's that supposed to mean?

07:29.143 --> 07:31.812
He helped you deal with her before.

07:31.979 --> 07:34.101
I'll call you later.

07:34.272 --> 07:36.598
Nice basket.
Is that for Greene and Corday?

07:36.775 --> 07:39.812
- Yeah, and you still owe $50.
- Fifty? For that?

07:39.987 --> 07:43.522
We got them a baby video monitor.
Nurses pitched in 20, doctors 50.

07:43.700 --> 07:45.408
I pay the same as Benton and Weaver?

07:45.577 --> 07:47.700
- Aren't you a doctor?
- That's debatable.

07:47.871 --> 07:52.332
- Cleo, can you take a lady in Exam 2?
- I'm already juggling seven patients.

07:52.501 --> 07:56.998
I'll trade you one.
Then can you lend me 50 bucks?

07:57.173 --> 07:59.461
Jing-Mei. I got a woman in Exam 2...

07:59.633 --> 08:02.967
...who hasn't had a bowel movement
in over a week. She needs a rectal.

08:03.137 --> 08:05.629
- So do it.
- Well, she threatened to Mace me.

08:05.807 --> 08:08.132
- You should be used to that.
- Take this one.

08:08.310 --> 08:09.721
No. Forget it.

08:09.895 --> 08:13.098
- What's the problem here?
- I don't know. Maybe it's your B.S.

08:13.274 --> 08:16.857
- Or maybe it's PMS.
- Excuse me?

08:17.028 --> 08:18.653
Look, I'm just saying-

08:18.822 --> 08:22.736
It's okay for you to dump a patient on
me and for you to refuse any handoffs.

08:22.909 --> 08:25.199
But the minute I do,
it's because I'm a bitch...

08:25.370 --> 08:28.537
- ... or that time of the month! Screw you.
- Forget it.

08:28.707 --> 08:31.708
- I'll leave.
- I'm tired of your crap!

08:32.169 --> 08:34.376
- Another 2-0 silk.
- Pressure's holding at 120.

08:34.547 --> 08:36.705
Dr. Benton, what are you
still doing in here?

08:36.883 --> 08:40.418
The gastrosplenic and splenorenal
were very vascular.

08:40.595 --> 08:43.596
- Are you suturing with your left hand?
- Yes, I'm ambidextrous.

08:43.765 --> 08:46.601
Like hell. I've seen third-year
medical students sew faster.

08:46.769 --> 08:49.011
Let me see you use your right hand.

08:52.274 --> 08:55.643
- Sterile gloves. What happened?
- I may have bruised my wrist.

08:55.820 --> 08:58.275
- How?
- Fell to an outstretched hand.

08:59.157 --> 09:02.989
Perfect mechanism for a fracture.
Get your hands out of the field, Peter.

09:03.161 --> 09:05.617
- What?
- Hold them out like this. Fingers spread.

09:11.587 --> 09:15.336
- Your radius and ulna feel okay?
- I'm fine.

09:15.508 --> 09:19.755
Point tenderness at the snuff box. We
call that a scaphoid fracture. Scrub out.

09:19.929 --> 09:22.467
- I can finish. I'm almost done.
- No, you are done.

09:22.641 --> 09:24.764
If this poor devil
had some complication...

09:24.935 --> 09:28.304
...and his lawyers discovered you were
operating with the wrong hand...

09:28.480 --> 09:30.390
...we both might as well bend over.

09:30.566 --> 09:35.110
Be thankful you're not a racehorse, Peter.
I'd have to take you out and shoot you.

09:35.280 --> 09:39.230
- Dr. Benton, your wife's here.
- What? I'm not married.

09:39.409 --> 09:42.115
- I'm sorry. Carla.
- Where is she?

09:42.288 --> 09:44.493
- How long have you had the pain?
- A few hours.

09:44.664 --> 09:47.666
- When was your last period?
- Seven weeks ago.

09:47.835 --> 09:51.204
When I didn't get it, I did a home
pregnancy test. It was positive.

09:51.380 --> 09:54.465
- That was two weeks ago.
- Have you seen your gynecologist?

09:54.634 --> 09:58.217
- You have a history of migraines?
- Yeah.

09:58.388 --> 10:01.140
And are you on any medication?

10:01.308 --> 10:05.472
Inderal and sumatriptan. But they're
not helping. It just keeps getting worse.

10:05.646 --> 10:09.394
- So where's the pain?
- It's all around my right eye.

10:09.566 --> 10:12.603
- How many other pregnancies?
- This is my first.

10:12.778 --> 10:15.945
- Am I having a miscarriage?
- I can't tell until we do some tests.

10:16.115 --> 10:18.951
And a pelvic exam as well.

10:19.661 --> 10:23.659
It pounds with every heartbeat.
I think it's the numbers.

10:23.832 --> 10:25.825
What, you're an accountant
or something?

10:26.002 --> 10:30.545
No, binary numbers.
Ones and zeros. Electronic data.

10:30.715 --> 10:34.416
80, 146, 72, 109.

10:34.595 --> 10:37.928
80, 146, 72, 109.

10:38.098 --> 10:39.758
- Deb.
- What?

10:39.933 --> 10:43.018
80, 146, 72, 109.

10:43.187 --> 10:46.354
80, 146, 72, 109.

10:46.524 --> 10:48.232
Freaky.

10:48.943 --> 10:51.102
I warned you!

10:51.279 --> 10:53.319
- What happened?
- Patient Maced him.

10:53.490 --> 10:57.322
- You happy now?!
- Flush his eyes with saline. Call Security.

10:57.494 --> 11:00.449
Give me that pepper spray.
Give it to me!

11:00.623 --> 11:03.374
Do you want me
to have you arrested?

11:03.542 --> 11:07.374
I told him not to touch me
or my personal possessions.

11:07.546 --> 11:11.461
Dr. Malucci was only trying to help you.
You could have seriously injured him.

11:11.634 --> 11:14.386
Well, I hope I taught him
some manners.

11:14.554 --> 11:18.006
- Have you been in this ER before?
- I've been in a lot ERs.

11:18.183 --> 11:20.390
And to be honest,
this one's substandard.

11:20.561 --> 11:22.720
Maybe you'd feel
more comfortable in jail.

11:22.897 --> 11:27.191
They used to drown redheaded babies
because they thought they were evil.

11:27.359 --> 11:31.274
And they used to burn crazy people
who they thought were witches.

11:32.699 --> 11:37.860
I just need something to help me go to
the bathroom. Is that too much to ask?!

11:39.498 --> 11:42.914
- She's historically non-med compliant?
- Well, she has phases.

11:43.086 --> 11:46.704
- But this time she's been off for about-
- Ma'am.

11:46.881 --> 11:48.424
Six months.

11:48.592 --> 11:54.262
- How many serious suicide attempts?
- This one makes three.

11:54.431 --> 11:57.302
- Don't you know this stuff?
- Just reviewing before we go in.

11:57.476 --> 11:59.303
I got the case this morning.

11:59.478 --> 12:02.479
- Hey, Marty. You got Wyninski?
- Wyczenski.

12:02.648 --> 12:05.104
- Wyczenski. Sorry.
- Yeah. Drug overdose.

12:05.276 --> 12:07.898
So you're stipulating
to an attempted suicide, right?

12:08.071 --> 12:11.820
No, but nice try. No intent.

12:15.579 --> 12:19.280
- I'm sorry, what was your name again?
- Abby.

12:19.458 --> 12:22.210
- Did you witness the attempt, Abby?
- I was with her.

12:22.378 --> 12:24.667
She took the pills in a bathroom.
Who was that?

12:24.839 --> 12:27.757
Your mother's public defender.
Since they won't stipulate...

12:27.926 --> 12:32.387
...I'll have you testify to the intention
and lethality of the attempt.

12:32.556 --> 12:36.554
- Nobody called me to testify.
- That's why you're here, right?

12:36.727 --> 12:38.554
You want your mother
to stay committed.

12:38.938 --> 12:41.430
Well, yes, but somebody should have-

12:41.608 --> 12:44.099
Okay. You're here now.

12:44.278 --> 12:45.901
Come on.

12:46.738 --> 12:49.988
I think we pretty much
have it all...

12:50.826 --> 12:53.233
Just answer all the questions
that we talked about.

12:53.412 --> 12:54.906
All right.

13:01.087 --> 13:05.132
Peter, I thought you would
never get here.

13:05.425 --> 13:07.418
- What happened?
- I was carrying Reece.

13:07.594 --> 13:11.010
I stepped in a grate in the sidewalk
and twisted my ankle so bad...

13:11.181 --> 13:12.972
...I thought I was going to pass out.

13:13.141 --> 13:15.847
Was he hurt? Are you hurt?

13:16.020 --> 13:18.772
He scraped his elbow. He's okay.

13:18.981 --> 13:22.018
Carla, you were carrying him
while you were wearing these?

13:22.193 --> 13:23.652
They said they wanna operate.

13:23.820 --> 13:26.821
I kept telling them to call you.
I do not want an operation.

13:26.990 --> 13:30.111
Yeah, well, you have
a trimalleolar fracture.

13:30.327 --> 13:33.033
They'll have to put a screw in it
so it'll heal properly.

13:33.206 --> 13:36.242
- Can't you do it?
- No. You need an orthopedic surgeon.

13:36.417 --> 13:39.371
Well, how long am I gonna have
to stay in the hospital?

13:39.545 --> 13:43.164
- A couple of days.
- I can't. Roger's out of town.

13:43.383 --> 13:44.711
Yeah, is he ever around?

13:44.885 --> 13:47.008
We haven't been
getting along well lately.

13:49.348 --> 13:52.598
Which is one of the reasons why
I cannot deal with this right now.

13:52.768 --> 13:56.054
I'll take Reece for a couple of days
till you get back on your feet.

13:56.272 --> 13:58.894
I don't think that's
gonna be a good idea.

13:59.067 --> 14:00.265
Why not?

14:00.485 --> 14:03.023
Jackie told me that you moved in
with that girlfriend.

14:03.196 --> 14:07.408
- And that's a problem?
- It's not a good environment for our son.

14:07.617 --> 14:11.201
Carla, give me a break.
She's a pediatrician.

14:11.372 --> 14:15.452
I'm just saying she don't seem
like the motherly type.

14:15.668 --> 14:18.076
She was admitted
following a suicide attempt.

14:18.254 --> 14:20.164
That's not what I asked, Dr. DeRaad.

14:20.340 --> 14:24.635
Has Mrs. Wyczenski shown any signs
of suicidality since her admission?

14:24.804 --> 14:25.835
Not that I'm aware of.

14:26.013 --> 14:28.468
She has voluntarily submitted
for all treatments...

14:28.640 --> 14:30.716
...and medications recommended
by your department?

14:30.893 --> 14:33.645
- That's correct.
- No further questions, Your Honor.

14:33.813 --> 14:36.767
Thank you, doctor.
Does the state have any more witnesses?

14:36.941 --> 14:40.358
Yes, Your Honor.
The people call Abby Lockhart.

14:40.529 --> 14:44.527
Hold on. All right, I was next.
I was next. It's my turn.

14:44.700 --> 14:46.278
That's enough.

14:47.411 --> 14:52.619
The testimony you shall give will be
the truth and nothing but the truth?

14:52.792 --> 14:54.168
Please have a seat.

14:55.253 --> 14:56.830
It was my turn.

14:58.256 --> 14:59.881
You're Mrs. Wyczenski's daughter?

15:00.050 --> 15:02.588
I've been waiting.
This bitch took my turn.

15:02.803 --> 15:04.178
Settle down.

15:05.097 --> 15:07.173
- Miss Lockhart?
- Yes.

15:07.349 --> 15:09.805
And as such,
you support a mandatory hold...

15:10.019 --> 15:13.223
...for your mother because she might
attempt to kill herself again.

15:13.398 --> 15:15.190
- Objection. Leading.
- Sustained.

15:15.359 --> 15:19.226
Miss Lockhart, do you feel your mother
should be involuntarily committed?

15:19.405 --> 15:21.444
- Yes.
- Why?

15:21.656 --> 15:24.823
- No. There are no such thing as cuts!
- Russell?

15:25.035 --> 15:27.953
No back cuts! No front cuts!
No, it's my turn!

15:28.164 --> 15:30.370
- That bitch stole my spot! Take her!
- Come on.

15:30.541 --> 15:32.914
- You take her out! I didn't do anything!
- Shut up.

15:33.545 --> 15:37.246
She took my spot! No! No!

15:37.466 --> 15:41.713
He was pushed down in an altercation.
No LOC. Tenderness to mid-shaft clavicle.

15:41.887 --> 15:43.715
- You said there's no LOC?
- He's faking.

15:43.890 --> 15:45.883
Vitals are normal.
No chest or belly pain.

15:46.058 --> 15:47.967
- What's his name?
- He refused to give it.

15:48.143 --> 15:50.682
He said it was "O. Possum. "

15:50.855 --> 15:52.764
His name's Brett Paxton,
and he's crazy.

15:52.941 --> 15:55.313
- What's this?
- Human bite to the left hand.

15:55.485 --> 15:57.443
I'll need stitches,
thanks to this freak.

15:57.613 --> 15:59.902
Cool it! Cool it! Okay. Okay.

16:00.074 --> 16:03.775
Take the opossum to Exam 1 and get
the kangaroo to Sutures. Come on.

16:03.995 --> 16:06.782
- God! Okay, okay, okay!
- You need to flush them out.

16:06.956 --> 16:08.996
Well, you've flushed
enough already. Okay?

16:09.167 --> 16:12.500
- Here you go.
- You know I've never worn one of those.

16:12.670 --> 16:18.258
Well, maybe it's time you at least
started dressing like a doctor. Come on.

16:21.180 --> 16:23.636
- What?
- Carter, your pregnancy's bleeding out!

16:23.808 --> 16:26.133
- Where is she?
- She's passed out in the bathroom.

16:26.811 --> 16:30.512
Noni? Oh, my God.
Noni, can you hear me? Wake up!

16:30.690 --> 16:33.775
- I can't find a pulse.
- She's got a weak carotid. Get a gurney.

16:33.944 --> 16:38.273
- You're divorced, Mrs. Lockhart?
- Objection. Irrelevant.

16:38.448 --> 16:41.153
- Goes to living arrangements, Your Honor.
- I'll allow it.

16:41.994 --> 16:43.453
Yes.

16:43.621 --> 16:46.077
- And when was your divorce finalized?
- Last summer.

16:46.249 --> 16:49.452
- Have you been dating anyone?
- Your Honor?

16:49.878 --> 16:52.583
Get to the point, Mr. Nesmith.

16:52.756 --> 16:57.798
Your mother can be eccentric,
maybe a little embarrassing at times?

16:58.012 --> 17:00.503
She suffers from a debilitating
mood disorder.

17:00.682 --> 17:04.549
Having her live with you while trying
to date would be a major inconvenience?

17:05.310 --> 17:08.146
I've tried having her live
with me before several times.

17:08.314 --> 17:10.188
- It doesn't work.
- Doesn't work?

17:10.400 --> 17:14.979
No. She stops taking her medications,
she loses control and she disappears.

17:17.282 --> 17:19.856
Does she look out of control to you?

17:23.080 --> 17:25.074
She's on her meds now.

17:25.250 --> 17:28.501
- So she does take her medication.
- She's only taken them for a week.

17:28.671 --> 17:31.077
As long as she's med compliant,
she's not a danger.

17:31.297 --> 17:34.833
- She doesn't stay med compliant.
- That wasn't my question.

17:35.010 --> 17:39.838
Have you known your mother to be
a danger to herself while med compliant?

17:40.933 --> 17:43.140
No. Not usually.

17:43.978 --> 17:48.606
You think locking her up in a psychiatric
facility would be better for her?

17:48.817 --> 17:51.225
- I can't take care of her.
- Can't or won't?

17:51.445 --> 17:54.197
- She tried to kill herself while with me.
- Nonresponsive.

17:54.365 --> 17:58.197
- Please. Just answer the questions.
- Well, tell him to ask them.

17:58.369 --> 18:00.278
Miss Lockhart.

18:01.497 --> 18:02.695
- You okay?
- Yes!

18:02.874 --> 18:04.867
- Would you like some water?
- No, thank you.

18:05.043 --> 18:06.241
BP's 60 palp.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.080
- What's her HemoCue?
-10.8.

18:08.255 --> 18:09.998
Good. She's got a little reserve.

18:10.174 --> 18:13.175
No fetal pole, no heartbeat.
Just blood and POCs.

18:13.344 --> 18:16.464
- That's an incomplete miscarriage.
- Call OB. She needs a D and C.

18:16.639 --> 18:18.134
I'll do a pelvic to see if-

18:18.308 --> 18:21.060
- Carter, this is her boyfriend.
- What happened?

18:21.228 --> 18:23.896
Your girlfriend had a miscarriage,
but it's incomplete.

18:24.063 --> 18:27.018
- She needs a D and C to stop bleeding.
- She's gonna be okay?

18:27.192 --> 18:30.810
She might need a transfusion.
I'll speak with you after she's stabilized.

18:30.988 --> 18:33.313
- Oh, God!
- Can you take him outside?

18:33.491 --> 18:36.492
Call for packed cells.
If pressure's not up after two liters...

18:36.661 --> 18:38.535
...HemoCue every 30 minutes.

18:38.997 --> 18:41.120
Are human bites
really worse than dog bites?

18:41.291 --> 18:43.498
Yeah, because of the virulence
of the bacteria.

18:43.669 --> 18:46.125
If germs infect the joint,
it can cause scarring...

18:46.297 --> 18:48.538
...which can limit
your range of motion.

18:48.715 --> 18:51.669
You don't wanna lose
your opposable thumb.

18:51.844 --> 18:54.596
So you guys rival mascots
or something?

18:54.764 --> 18:58.976
No, we were at the Furturama show.
It's a convention for furries.

18:59.144 --> 19:02.513
People who like to dress
in animal costumes.

19:02.689 --> 19:04.978
He started it.
I think he'd been drinking.

19:05.150 --> 19:08.068
- One minute he was skritching me-
- Skritching?

19:08.571 --> 19:12.154
Scratching. Mock grooming.
Sort of our version of a handshake.

19:12.325 --> 19:14.815
Next thing you know,
he's got his hand in my pouch.

19:14.994 --> 19:18.030
So I decked him.
I'm not into the weird stuff.

19:20.208 --> 19:23.458
It makes me sick.
I never felt like myself.

19:23.628 --> 19:26.298
I told the doctors that.
They never really listen to me.

19:26.465 --> 19:28.791
They just keep giving me more pills.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.877
- How do you feel now?
- Better.

19:31.095 --> 19:34.630
- So you're no longer depressed?
- No.

19:34.849 --> 19:38.433
Did you try to kill yourself
during your last depressive episode?

19:39.938 --> 19:44.267
I took an overdose
of sleeping pills, yes.

19:45.777 --> 19:47.687
But I never meant to kill myself.

19:47.905 --> 19:48.936
She's lying.

19:49.115 --> 19:50.657
Why did you take so many pills?

19:50.825 --> 19:55.534
Who in their right mind wants to drive
from Oklahoma to Chicago, really?

19:55.705 --> 19:57.947
I get carsick.

19:58.792 --> 20:03.004
I just thought if I could sleep,
I'd be all right.

20:03.172 --> 20:04.631
I took some pills.

20:04.841 --> 20:07.876
- She took 900 milligrams.
- They didn't work right away.

20:08.469 --> 20:11.174
You know, I foolishly then took
some more pills.

20:11.347 --> 20:14.514
- She took 900 milligrams. That's 36 pills.
- How much did you take?

20:14.726 --> 20:20.313
I know it was stupid.
I just thought if I could sleep...

20:21.442 --> 20:24.893
The next thing I know,
I woke up in the hospital.

20:25.071 --> 20:28.072
But I never meant to hurt myself
or anyone else.

20:28.241 --> 20:32.903
Abby, I'm so sorry.
I never meant to put you through that.

20:33.079 --> 20:34.657
Ask her where she got the pills.

20:34.831 --> 20:36.290
- She stole them.
- Mr. Rifkin...

20:36.499 --> 20:39.073
...could you please
ask your witness to be quiet?

20:39.252 --> 20:43.416
If your daughter's not ready to take you
in, are you able to take care of yourself?

20:43.591 --> 20:46.164
I always have.
I've always worked. Always.

20:46.385 --> 20:49.091
- Do you have any money?
- I have a few credit cards.

20:49.305 --> 20:51.927
- They' re all canceled.
- I mean it, Miss Lockhart.

20:53.769 --> 20:55.477
HemoCue every 20 minutes.

20:55.646 --> 20:58.730
Set up a DIC panel
and call me with the results.

20:58.899 --> 21:02.648
- What's happening?
- She's going up to the O.R.

21:02.820 --> 21:05.821
I removed some tissue from her cervix.
She's still bleeding...

21:05.990 --> 21:09.525
...but it's slowed to the point
that her pressure's okay.

21:09.702 --> 21:12.324
- Did you do a blood transfusion?
- We gave her plasma.

21:12.497 --> 21:15.748
- Her blood wasn't clotting properly.
- Why isn't her blood clotting?

21:15.918 --> 21:20.414
It could be a sign of liver disease.
The liver affects the clotting factors.

21:20.590 --> 21:23.127
She ever have hepatitis?

21:23.801 --> 21:25.129
No.

21:25.302 --> 21:28.138
- She drink alcohol every day?
- No.

21:28.306 --> 21:31.758
Tylenol? Any other medications?

21:34.855 --> 21:37.856
Maybe some herbal stuff.

21:38.692 --> 21:41.184
What kind of herbal stuff?

21:41.487 --> 21:45.188
Root extracts. They' re supposed
to induce miscarriages.

21:45.367 --> 21:48.238
I thought she wanted this baby.

21:49.036 --> 21:50.910
She didn't know.

21:51.080 --> 21:53.868
- How could she not know?
- I gave them to her.

21:55.544 --> 21:57.371
You what?

21:57.546 --> 22:00.713
Put them in her tea
for the last few days.

22:01.676 --> 22:04.001
She didn't even ask me
if I wanted the baby.

22:04.178 --> 22:07.548
- So you poisoned her?
- I wasn't ready.

22:07.724 --> 22:10.725
- I thought she'd just-
- What? Bleed to death?

22:10.936 --> 22:13.688
I didn't mean to make her sick.

22:15.023 --> 22:18.024
No, man, you just meant
to kill her baby.

22:19.069 --> 22:22.984
You have a large tumor
on your left ovary.

22:23.157 --> 22:25.695
I came in here
because I couldn't poop.

22:25.869 --> 22:29.452
The tumor is large enough that
it's blocking your bowel movements.

22:30.332 --> 22:32.241
Cancer?

22:32.418 --> 22:34.624
Well, well, well.

22:34.795 --> 22:37.631
Every day comes
with its own surprises.

22:38.258 --> 22:40.416
- What?
- Nothing.

22:42.637 --> 22:45.258
That's how I know you.
You're Princess Taffeta.

22:45.431 --> 22:49.893
And you had that children's show I used
to watch all the time when I was little.

22:50.062 --> 22:53.680
And you always used to say, "Every day
comes with its own surprises. "

22:53.899 --> 22:57.185
- I don't think so.
- You worked with those great puppets.

22:57.361 --> 23:01.490
There was Mojo and Mr. Whiskers,
and what was that-?

23:01.658 --> 23:04.908
Coconuts!
The chimpanzee in the sailor uniform.

23:05.120 --> 23:06.863
We got that monkey from a lab...

23:07.038 --> 23:12.460
...and we had to dress him in that
stupid outfit to hide his open sores!

23:15.130 --> 23:17.622
We need to admit you.

23:18.426 --> 23:21.676
A gynecologist will want to see you
and start treatment right away.

23:21.846 --> 23:24.883
No, thanks. I don't like hospitals!

23:25.058 --> 23:29.555
Look, the tumor will only get worse,
and you'll feel sicker.

23:32.400 --> 23:34.143
Is there someone that we can call?

23:34.318 --> 23:37.105
A family member, perhaps,
who can talk to you about this?

23:37.279 --> 23:41.989
Nope. Don't have any brothers
or sisters and never got married.

23:42.452 --> 23:47.245
I was engaged once to a man
named Christopher Clemmons.

23:47.416 --> 23:50.251
He was gonna be
a famous jazz musician.

23:50.419 --> 23:52.626
I was gonna be a movie star.

23:54.132 --> 23:56.290
Doesn't really matter now.

23:56.468 --> 24:00.845
In the end, everybody dies alone.
Right?

24:09.189 --> 24:11.977
Excuse me, you got a light?

24:40.182 --> 24:43.551
- This is turning into a freaking disaster.
- You did fine.

24:47.899 --> 24:51.232
- Who's covering for you?
- Don't worry about it.

24:53.279 --> 24:55.022
I'm not hungry.

24:55.198 --> 24:57.404
She's asking for you.

24:59.411 --> 25:02.531
- Maybe you should talk to her.
- What for?

25:04.959 --> 25:06.998
You didn't want me to deal with her.

25:07.169 --> 25:10.455
No. I thought
she needed hospitalization.

25:10.673 --> 25:12.916
Well, why do you think I'm here?

25:13.093 --> 25:17.422
Because you know she needs your help,
even if she doesn't want it.

25:32.280 --> 25:35.696
- I thought you should eat something.
- Thank you.

25:47.463 --> 25:49.290
You lied.

25:51.801 --> 25:54.375
You wanted to kill yourself.

25:54.554 --> 25:57.128
I can't be committed.

25:57.724 --> 26:02.019
Well, you need help, Mom. And
I obviously don't know how to help you.

26:02.188 --> 26:05.273
I understand. I don't want
to be a burden to you, Abby.

26:05.442 --> 26:09.818
I swear that's the truth.
But I can't be committed.

26:10.029 --> 26:12.271
So you'll just do this
to yourself over again?

26:12.448 --> 26:15.652
- You'll just roll through the whole cycle?
- No.

26:15.994 --> 26:17.702
Then what?

26:18.330 --> 26:21.865
What? What are you gonna do
differently this time?

26:22.043 --> 26:26.123
I don't know. I don't want
to break any more promises to you.

26:26.297 --> 26:28.124
I've put you through
so much already-

26:28.300 --> 26:30.376
If you believe that,
you'd seek treatment.

26:30.552 --> 26:33.008
- I will. I just-
- Can't be committed.

26:33.556 --> 26:35.429
Right. Well...

26:36.850 --> 26:40.979
Well, just forgive me
if I don't trust your judgment.

26:46.486 --> 26:51.694
I would have found a way to try,
Abby. It's not your fault.

26:51.867 --> 26:54.868
Nothing I do is your fault.

26:56.622 --> 26:58.781
My company has
this Christmas charity event.

26:58.958 --> 27:02.124
One year the guy who always
dresses up for the kids got sick.

27:02.294 --> 27:04.417
My boss made me
put on this reindeer suit.

27:04.589 --> 27:07.080
The kids went nuts.
The adults thought it was great.

27:07.258 --> 27:08.918
Everybody took pictures with me.

27:09.094 --> 27:11.170
- Sounds almost fun.
- It was a blast.

27:11.346 --> 27:15.261
I used to be so shy.
But the suit gives you freedom.

27:15.434 --> 27:18.186
It lets you do things
you normally wouldn't do.

27:18.354 --> 27:21.937
- But I'm not a plushie or a furvert.
- A what?

27:22.108 --> 27:24.481
Furverts like
to wear their suits during sex.

27:24.653 --> 27:27.606
And plushies are overly fond
of stuffed animals.

27:27.822 --> 27:30.859
- What?
- But not me. I just like the suit.

27:33.745 --> 27:36.830
Some people disapprove and think
it's wrong, but the truth is...

27:36.999 --> 27:40.036
...I'm never happier
than when I'm a kangaroo.

27:40.628 --> 27:44.626
You have to rule out appendicitis,
biliary disease, food poisoning.

27:44.800 --> 27:47.338
- Does she have a fever?
- No. 98.8.

27:47.511 --> 27:51.177
Good breath sounds.
What's that smell?

27:54.852 --> 27:57.557
- Oh, my God.
- I've seen this before.

27:57.771 --> 27:59.848
Get a surgical consult.
I'll call DCFS.

28:00.024 --> 28:03.892
No. It's a folk cure. They heat a coin over
a candle and drag it across the back.

28:04.070 --> 28:06.277
Sometimes they dip the coins
in essential oils.

28:06.448 --> 28:10.149
Just because it's an ancient tradition
doesn't mean it's not child abuse.

28:10.327 --> 28:14.954
The minty smell is oil of wintergreen. It's
got a high concentration of salicylates.

28:15.124 --> 28:17.413
It could have caused
the aspirin toxicity.

28:17.585 --> 28:20.539
Let's get a blood gas
and a salicylate level.

28:20.713 --> 28:23.917
You do that.
I'm calling Family Services.

28:25.051 --> 28:29.595
- Will I be able to have more children?
- Yes.

28:34.604 --> 28:38.388
Noni, what your boyfriend did
was really wrong.

28:39.150 --> 28:42.068
You need to consider whether or not
to file criminal charges.

28:42.237 --> 28:44.443
Victor loves me.

28:45.907 --> 28:50.237
- He just got scared.
- That doesn't justify what he did.

28:52.581 --> 28:55.998
I was so excited to be pregnant.

29:03.844 --> 29:06.216
What do you want to do?

29:08.933 --> 29:11.886
Mrs. Wyczenski, are you familiar
with reading directions...

29:12.061 --> 29:15.311
...and warnings
on over-the-counter medications?

29:15.481 --> 29:17.225
Yes, I suppose so.

29:17.400 --> 29:20.070
Would you please read
the label on this?

29:20.236 --> 29:22.989
I'm sorry, I don't have
my reading glasses. I can't see.

29:23.657 --> 29:26.231
- Allow me, then.
- Okay.

29:26.786 --> 29:31.744
"One tablet at bedtime.
May repeat in four hours if necessary.

29:31.916 --> 29:36.625
Do not exceed four tablets
in a 24-hour period. "

29:36.796 --> 29:38.836
You took 36 tablets, did you not?

29:39.340 --> 29:42.792
I didn't have my reading glasses
with me then either.

29:42.969 --> 29:48.843
You took 36 pills and you didn't
intend to kill yourself?

29:50.186 --> 29:53.140
I was depressed, but I didn't want
to kill myself. Really.

29:53.314 --> 29:56.600
- Where did you get the pills?
- I got them at a convenience store.

29:56.777 --> 29:59.268
How did you pay for them?

29:59.697 --> 30:02.021
- I didn't.
- You stole them?

30:02.240 --> 30:05.325
Objection. Shoplifting has nothing
to do with suicidality.

30:05.494 --> 30:08.329
- Goes to intent.
- Get to it quickly.

30:08.664 --> 30:11.155
Why did you have to steal them?

30:11.334 --> 30:13.955
Why didn't you ask your daughter
to pay for them?

30:14.170 --> 30:16.875
- She wouldn't have.
- Why not?

30:17.049 --> 30:21.545
- She was worried.
- Worried that you'd try to kill yourself?

30:21.762 --> 30:25.013
She worries when I get depressed.

30:25.183 --> 30:28.053
Because during other depressions
you have attempted suicide.

30:28.227 --> 30:33.186
In fact, you've been committed on two
other occasions for attempted suicide.

30:33.399 --> 30:37.694
- In '83 and 1974.
- Yes.

30:37.904 --> 30:42.697
- What method did you use for those?
- Carbon monoxide poisoning.

30:42.868 --> 30:45.027
In '83.

30:45.204 --> 30:48.953
- What about in '74?
- I took some pills.

30:52.087 --> 30:56.036
Did you coin Lynda
because she's sick?

30:57.717 --> 30:59.509
I don't understand
what you're saying.

30:59.678 --> 31:02.003
Could someone get me
a translator? Where's Chen?

31:02.181 --> 31:03.212
Look who's here!

31:03.390 --> 31:05.383
Your cardiac enzymes
are back, Mr. Ferris.

31:05.560 --> 31:06.935
You had a small heart attack.

31:07.103 --> 31:09.226
What did I tell you?
I know heart attacks.

31:09.397 --> 31:13.098
- I'm lucky you showed up when you did.
- We kept you alive till he got there.

31:13.694 --> 31:17.312
If there are any blockages, we'll open it
with an angioplasty balloon...

31:17.490 --> 31:20.324
- ... and we'll keep it open with a stent.
- Thank you, Peter.

31:20.492 --> 31:24.111
Not bad for a guy who blew up
a rubber in your classroom.

31:24.288 --> 31:25.782
I'll check on you later.

31:25.957 --> 31:28.329
Hi, Reece. What are you doing here?

31:28.501 --> 31:31.752
His mother broke her ankle.
She's waiting to be admitted to Surgery.

31:31.922 --> 31:33.546
- Could you look at a belly?
- Sure.

31:33.715 --> 31:35.376
Excuse me.

31:38.971 --> 31:41.842
I don't understand
what you're saying.

31:42.016 --> 31:43.559
Could you just calm down?

31:43.727 --> 31:47.060
- She seems pretty upset.
- You think?

31:50.608 --> 31:51.854
You speak Cantonese?

31:52.027 --> 31:54.565
You think? I was
a translator in the Army.

31:54.738 --> 31:57.490
Could you ask her what she
treated her granddaughter with?

31:57.658 --> 32:00.030
- I think I can manage.
- Excuse me.

32:00.202 --> 32:04.283
Malucci. Her labs are back.
Electrolytes are normal. No anion gap.

32:04.457 --> 32:08.538
PH 7.4. Salicylate level's
10 milligrams per deciliter.

32:08.712 --> 32:10.788
- Well, that's not a toxic range.
- Nope.

32:10.965 --> 32:13.716
Her liver-function tests
and her head CT are also normal.

32:13.884 --> 32:16.173
Then it's one hell of a case
of gastroenteritis.

32:16.345 --> 32:18.836
We've given her 10 of Compazine.
She's still puking.

32:19.014 --> 32:21.173
Peter's looking at her now.
I'll let you know.

32:21.350 --> 32:23.059
Well, anything?

32:24.687 --> 32:27.226
She said she used hot coins
and liniment.

32:27.399 --> 32:30.069
Yeah, I know that.
But did she say why?

32:30.235 --> 32:31.564
She's possessed.

32:31.737 --> 32:35.652
Grandma or the girl? What are we
talking here, demonic spirits?

32:35.825 --> 32:38.825
No, more like evil thoughts.
Sinful behavior.

32:38.994 --> 32:42.031
You know, S-E-X.

32:44.459 --> 32:46.535
Faye? Faye!

32:46.962 --> 32:49.631
Faye, where are you going?
Where're you going?

32:49.798 --> 32:51.542
I got a garden party at 6.

32:51.717 --> 32:54.967
You need to be admitted to the hospital
so you can start treatment.

32:55.137 --> 32:59.432
- We both know that's not gonna happen.
- You can't leave. Come on.

32:59.601 --> 33:04.061
I've never been one for hospitals.
They smell funny.

33:04.814 --> 33:06.606
Besides, I already signed the papers.

33:06.775 --> 33:09.562
Will you at least speak
to a psychiatrist?

33:12.406 --> 33:14.280
Mr. Whiskers.

33:14.450 --> 33:17.404
- Take it.
- No, I can't. Really.

33:17.620 --> 33:22.247
Look, honey, I'm gonna be dead
in a few months. You said so yourself.

33:22.417 --> 33:26.118
Make me feel better knowing he's
with someone who'll appreciate him.

33:26.338 --> 33:29.374
Stupid puppet ended my acting career.

33:29.925 --> 33:33.294
But it did buy my first house.

33:34.722 --> 33:36.549
Thank you.

33:38.226 --> 33:42.556
Every day comes
with its own surprises.

33:44.900 --> 33:47.570
A statement from a former employer
of Mrs. Wyczenski-

33:47.736 --> 33:51.070
- I don't need any more statements.
- The employer affirms that-

33:51.240 --> 33:54.610
We've spent more than enough time
on this one already. Let's move on.

33:54.786 --> 33:57.407
Mrs. Wyczenski is released
on her own recognizance.

33:58.080 --> 34:00.868
- What's next, Mike?
- Well, that's good. You won.

34:01.376 --> 34:03.119
- Is this yours, Marty?
- Yes, it is.

34:03.295 --> 34:05.169
- So I can just go?
- Yes, you can go.

34:05.380 --> 34:07.373
- Wait a minute. That's it?
- I'm sorry.

34:07.549 --> 34:09.755
- She's letting her go?
- Is the respondent here?

34:09.927 --> 34:12.418
- Yes, he is, Your Honor.
- She needs hospitalization!

34:12.597 --> 34:15.467
I'm not debating it with you.
You've counseled your client?

34:15.641 --> 34:17.433
- I have.
- Yeah, but, I mean, that's-

34:17.601 --> 34:20.224
We did all we can. I'm sorry.
We have to move on.

34:20.397 --> 34:23.600
You're done. It's good. Just go back
to the hospital and sign out.

34:23.775 --> 34:27.109
Okay. That's good. Move on.
All of you should just move on.

34:27.279 --> 34:29.106
We wouldn't want
to waste time on this.

34:29.281 --> 34:32.033
- I've been dealing with her for 30 years.
- Russell?

34:32.201 --> 34:34.574
You didn't have to drive her
to the hospital.

34:34.746 --> 34:36.952
Pour charcoal down her throat.
Breathe for her.

34:37.123 --> 34:38.618
- This way.
- I'm getting my coat!

34:38.792 --> 34:40.167
Just don't touch her.

34:40.377 --> 34:42.536
She's not your mother.
What do you care?

34:42.713 --> 34:47.790
The rest of us will take care of her. And
maybe if you're really lucky next time...

34:48.010 --> 34:51.759
...you won't have to hear the case at all.
Maybe next time you'll do it right!

34:51.931 --> 34:54.683
And then it'll be
the coroner's problem.

34:58.313 --> 35:00.520
No evidence of appendicitis
or pancreatitis.

35:00.691 --> 35:02.814
- Biliary colic?
- No.

35:02.985 --> 35:05.274
- I'm about to give up.
- Did you check for pyelo?

35:05.446 --> 35:09.278
Yes. And hepatitis. You should get an
x- ray of that wrist if it's bothering you.

35:09.451 --> 35:10.482
I'm fine.

35:10.660 --> 35:13.495
- What will you do with Reece?
- I left a message for Jackie.

35:13.663 --> 35:16.332
Hopefully she can pick him up
on her way home from work.

35:16.499 --> 35:19.666
Why don't you take him home?
You can't do anything with that hand.

35:19.836 --> 35:22.043
I wanna stick around
until Ferris gets a room.

35:22.214 --> 35:25.168
Then I'll take him home with me.
I'm off in an hour.

35:25.342 --> 35:29.091
- No, I don't want you to have to do that.
- I don't mind.

35:29.264 --> 35:32.431
We'll have fun, right?

35:33.393 --> 35:36.644
- All right. Thanks.
- You have to let me take an x-ray.

35:36.855 --> 35:39.725
Come on,
you're resorting to blackmail?

35:43.570 --> 35:45.065
What the hell is that?

35:45.239 --> 35:48.193
I remember Mr. Whiskers!
Where did you get him? On eBay?

35:48.367 --> 35:50.693
Princess Taffeta was the patient
who Maced you.

35:50.870 --> 35:53.706
- That's probably worth some money.
- Looks like roadkill.

35:53.874 --> 35:56.543
Malucci, there's a priest in
with Lynda An?

35:56.710 --> 35:59.248
- Yeah. He's doing an exorcism.
- Excuse me?

35:59.422 --> 36:02.043
Actually, he's a chaplain,
and it's more of a blessing.

36:02.216 --> 36:04.967
But it should work.
I think her problem's psychosomatic.

36:05.135 --> 36:07.259
Based on your vast knowledge
of psychiatry?

36:07.430 --> 36:10.764
And the fact her grandma caught her
messing around with her boyfriend.

36:10.934 --> 36:13.851
It's all about guilt.
Hey, how's it working out with Lynda?

36:14.020 --> 36:16.227
- I think she's gonna be fine.
- Excellent.

36:16.398 --> 36:18.391
- How are you feeling, Lynda?
- Hungry.

36:18.567 --> 36:21.058
- No more nausea?
- No. I'm starving.

36:21.237 --> 36:24.487
She's eating solid foods and not vomiting.
She's ready to go home.

36:24.657 --> 36:28.572
I'd like to admit you, keep you overnight
for observation and rehydration.

36:28.745 --> 36:32.280
- Could I get a pizza or something?
- We'll see what we can work out, okay?

36:32.457 --> 36:35.542
- Nice catch.
- I'd still like to do some more tests.

36:35.710 --> 36:38.831
Why, because you can't admit
that a surgeon and a pediatrician...

36:39.006 --> 36:41.248
...got outsmarted by a goombah?

36:41.425 --> 36:42.920
Yeah. Don't sweat it.

36:43.094 --> 36:47.174
You're not the first to be deceived by my
rugged good looks and boyish charm.

36:47.724 --> 36:51.425
By signing, you acknowledge doctors
feel it's best you remain hospitalized...

36:51.603 --> 36:54.937
...and you accept and understand
by leaving against medical advice...

36:55.107 --> 36:59.057
...you risk a deterioration
of your psychiatric symptoms.

36:59.236 --> 37:01.810
What about my meds?

37:02.573 --> 37:04.151
Can I have a prescription?

37:04.325 --> 37:07.113
I will give you three days' worth.

37:07.287 --> 37:09.280
I want to see you Monday.

37:09.456 --> 37:11.912
If you' re doing well,
I'll give you a week's worth.

37:12.084 --> 37:14.290
- Okay.
- Okay what? What does that mean?

37:14.461 --> 37:17.498
- Could I call you?
- Sure.

37:17.673 --> 37:19.417
- All right.
- You can call me anytime.

37:19.592 --> 37:22.842
- You can call me just to talk.
- Okay.

37:29.227 --> 37:33.391
I got some stuff from that motel room
and some stuff you left in my apartment.

37:33.565 --> 37:37.433
- Thank you.
- Figure out where you're going?

37:39.614 --> 37:44.276
Yeah. Dr. Legaspi gave me
the name of a shelter.

37:44.453 --> 37:47.739
I'm gonna go there for a few days.

37:47.915 --> 37:49.990
- Okay.
- Okay.

37:54.213 --> 37:56.538
Good luck, Maggie.

37:56.715 --> 38:00.334
- See you next time.
- Next time?

38:00.511 --> 38:03.762
Yeah, whenever it is,
wherever it is...

38:04.558 --> 38:07.429
Maybe there won't be a next time.

38:12.525 --> 38:16.143
You're gonna walk out of here
on your own one week...

38:16.320 --> 38:19.820
...after swallowing a pharmacy,
as close to death as I see people get...

38:19.991 --> 38:22.862
...and you think there's not
gonna be a next time?

38:24.788 --> 38:27.362
I hope not. I don't know.

38:27.541 --> 38:30.412
I promised myself
I wouldn't make any promises.

38:31.879 --> 38:33.539
You know...

38:33.715 --> 38:38.591
...when I saw you seizing
on that table, I thought:

38:38.762 --> 38:41.596
"This is it. This is it.
This is how it's all gonna end.

38:41.764 --> 38:44.220
I am going to watch my mother die. "

38:47.312 --> 38:50.516
I still might not be wrong about that.
It could still end that way.

38:50.691 --> 38:55.021
And there's not one thing
I can do about it. But I'll show up.

38:56.865 --> 38:59.403
Because you will always have
that power over me.

38:59.576 --> 39:02.992
I will show up
and I will try to stop it.

39:08.251 --> 39:10.624
I love you, Mom.

39:19.931 --> 39:23.799
- How long will she be in the hospital?
- We'll keep her overnight for observation.

39:23.978 --> 39:25.686
- Could I see her?
- I don't think so.

39:25.855 --> 39:28.263
- I wanna talk to her.
- She prefers to be alone.

39:28.483 --> 39:30.025
You need to speak to the police.

39:30.193 --> 39:31.308
- Is this him?
- It's him.

39:31.486 --> 39:35.151
This is between me and Noni. What did
you do, talk her into pressing charges?

39:35.323 --> 39:38.110
- I didn't have to. Murder is a felony.
- Come with me, sir.

39:38.284 --> 39:39.945
It wasn't even a baby.

39:40.120 --> 39:44.498
Can I speak with Dr. Quaid?
Daryl Quaid.

39:44.667 --> 39:48.499
Well, he gave me his card
and it has this number on it.

39:48.671 --> 39:52.206
Right. Okay, thanks.

39:52.384 --> 39:54.293
One of those days?

39:54.469 --> 39:58.217
Ever find out what happened with
your numbers guy? Was he a savant?

39:58.389 --> 40:02.174
Don't know. He left with this doctor
from the VA. I just called to follow up...

40:02.352 --> 40:05.935
...but there's no record of my patient
or the doctor I let him leave with.

40:06.106 --> 40:08.313
- What will you do?
- Same thing as I always do.

40:08.484 --> 40:10.773
Hit a bar, get drunk,
go home with a stranger...

40:10.945 --> 40:13.318
...and have wild sex until I pass out
from exhaustion.

40:13.490 --> 40:14.949
- Takeout and a hot bath?
- Yeah.

40:15.117 --> 40:17.193
- Randi, have you seen my puppet?
- Your what?

40:17.369 --> 40:19.445
- Mr. Whiskers.
- I didn't touch it. Trust me.

40:19.622 --> 40:21.496
Can't believe somebody
would steal that.

40:21.666 --> 40:23.823
- Where do you guys want Super Larry?
- Exam 1.

40:24.001 --> 40:27.335
- The opossum guy's still in there.
- Okay. Well, let's get rid of him.

40:27.504 --> 40:29.414
Mr. Paxton?

40:30.842 --> 40:34.756
Mr. Paxton?
You still playing opossum?

40:38.517 --> 40:41.269
Mr. Whiskers!

40:44.148 --> 40:48.645
- Whatever happened to Mrs. Lindstrom?
- Retired.

40:48.820 --> 40:50.527
She was mean.

40:50.696 --> 40:53.532
That woman was born mean.

40:53.700 --> 40:57.698
Even the other teachers
were afraid of her.

41:01.166 --> 41:05.414
I'm sure you thought the same of me
with all those detentions I gave you.

41:07.048 --> 41:09.919
Your detentions steered me
towards medicine. So...

41:10.093 --> 41:14.174
I might have played a small role in it.
I'm proud of you, Peter.

41:15.349 --> 41:17.222
Yeah, well, thanks a lot.

41:18.059 --> 41:20.515
And you should be proud of yourself.

41:21.563 --> 41:23.722
I am. Look, don't get me wrong.

41:23.899 --> 41:27.600
Sometimes it's hard when people's
lives depend on your success...

41:27.779 --> 41:30.187
...and you're not always successful.

41:30.365 --> 41:32.572
Sometimes you-

41:32.743 --> 41:37.452
Sometimes you get so tired that you
start forgetting what's important.

41:37.915 --> 41:40.157
And what is that?

41:40.376 --> 41:42.285
Two things in this world
I'm certain of:

41:42.461 --> 41:45.830
My love for my son
and my skills as a surgeon.

41:46.007 --> 41:50.219
I'm a father, I'm a doctor.

41:50.387 --> 41:52.261
At the end of the day, that's enough.

41:52.431 --> 41:53.711
What about a teacher?

41:53.891 --> 41:56.382
That was never one
of my greatest skills.

41:56.602 --> 42:01.348
The only skill you need
to be a good teacher is to care.

42:01.566 --> 42:03.642
That's all.

42:04.110 --> 42:09.650
Who knows? Maybe one of your students
will wind up saving your ass one day.

42:16.999 --> 42:19.288
- Hi.
- Hi.

42:19.460 --> 42:23.079
I heard you were here,
but I haven't seen you.

42:23.256 --> 42:26.460
Yeah. Most of my day is spent
in the jail ward.

42:26.635 --> 42:28.462
I'm sorry.

42:29.930 --> 42:32.303
I was glad to hear
that the charges were dropped.

42:32.475 --> 42:34.550
Shannon Wallace decided
to tell the truth...

42:34.726 --> 42:37.514
...after she got the treatment
that she needed.

42:37.688 --> 42:39.348
That's good.

42:39.940 --> 42:43.606
- What do you want, Kerry?
- I thought you might be hungry.

42:43.778 --> 42:47.776
No. No, I'm not, and I have
a ton of work to do. So...

42:49.159 --> 42:52.860
Right. Well, if you change your mind...

42:53.039 --> 42:56.622
...here's some Kung Pao chicken
from George's.

43:05.301 --> 43:09.134
Abby, are you okay in there?

43:09.640 --> 43:11.632
Want some dinner?

43:13.477 --> 43:15.387
You need to eat.

43:32.289 --> 43:35.540
Have you been watching
Martha Stewart again?

43:39.631 --> 43:41.707
- Thank you.
- For what?

43:41.883 --> 43:44.256
For being there.

43:44.428 --> 43:45.922
And here.

43:46.096 --> 43:47.840
Everything.

43:50.017 --> 43:51.974
- Is the food here?
- What food?

43:52.144 --> 43:54.386
I'm making dinner by myself.

43:54.563 --> 43:56.058
Why are you laughing?

43:56.232 --> 43:59.648
I just hope you didn't order
from that Thai place again.

44:01.488 --> 44:03.362
Who is it?

44:04.074 --> 44:05.652
Abby?
