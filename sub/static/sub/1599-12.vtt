00:04.361 --> 00:06.796
Honey...

00:06.830 --> 00:10.066
you're never gonna believe
what I did today.

00:10.100 --> 00:13.336
I decided to take
over the Glee Club.

KURT: <i> My name is Kurt Hummel.</i>

00:26.283 --> 00:27.516
<i>I'm a sophomore at McKinley.</i>

00:27.551 --> 00:29.485
<i>My first day at this school,</i>

00:29.519 --> 00:31.253
<i>the principal got up in front
of the whole freshman class</i>

00:31.288 --> 00:33.055
<i>and told us that
the next four years</i>

00:33.090 --> 00:34.857
<i>were going to be the best years
of our lives.</i>

00:34.891 --> 00:36.258
Out of the way, fag!

00:36.293 --> 00:37.526
<i>What a joke.</i>

00:37.561 --> 00:39.195
Sorry.

00:39.229 --> 00:41.530
Hope I didn't make you late
for remedial math.

00:41.565 --> 00:43.733
What was that?

00:43.767 --> 00:46.235
Nothing. I just...
I just said I was sorry.

00:48.638 --> 00:50.039
(kicks books)

00:52.042 --> 00:53.409
Nice.

00:53.443 --> 00:55.277
Hey, bro, don't be gay.

00:55.312 --> 00:59.482
KURT: <i> Another day, another</i>
<i>cataclysmic humiliation.</i>

01:01.485 --> 01:04.953
<i>Everywhere I go,
I'm isolated and alone.</i>

01:04.988 --> 01:07.308
<i>I know my mom used to tell me
how good it made her feel</i>

01:07.324 --> 01:08.891
<i>that I was such a happy kid,</i>

01:08.925 --> 01:10.726
<i>but honestly,
I don't even remember</i>

01:10.761 --> 01:13.095
<i>what that would've
even felt like.</i>

01:13.130 --> 01:14.864
<i>I feel like I could die tomorrow</i>

01:14.898 --> 01:16.866
<i>and I don't think
anyone would really care.</i>

01:16.900 --> 01:20.336
<i>I'm not sure
anyone would even notice.</i>

01:24.975 --> 01:26.575
EMMA:
Can I help you?

01:26.610 --> 01:28.210
Oh! No. I'm-I'm sorry.

01:28.245 --> 01:29.445
I-I just made a wrong turn.

01:29.479 --> 01:31.147
What's your name?
Kurt Hummel.

01:31.181 --> 01:33.849
Hi, Kurt. I'm Miss Pillsbury,
the guidance counselor.

01:36.153 --> 01:38.154
Are you new to the school?
I'm a sophomore.

01:38.188 --> 01:39.255
That's awkward.

01:39.289 --> 01:41.557
Well, if you ever need anything,

01:41.591 --> 01:42.892
my door is always open.

01:42.926 --> 01:44.393
(quietly): One, two,
three, four, five.

01:44.428 --> 01:46.762
Because feelings don't
take vacations, do they?

01:46.797 --> 01:48.064
They work in 24-hour shifts.

01:48.098 --> 01:49.565
I mean, I don't.

01:49.599 --> 01:51.000
I'm only here during
regular school hours.

01:51.034 --> 01:52.668
And I take vacation.

01:52.703 --> 01:54.270
I try not to eat into
my sick days...

01:54.304 --> 01:56.464
It was nice meeting you.
Yeah, it was nice meeting you.

01:56.473 --> 01:57.707
Mm-hmm.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:07.684 --> 02:09.685
(school bell ringing)

02:15.359 --> 02:17.660
What is that on your hands
and your coveralls?

02:17.694 --> 02:20.096
What would you call that?
Is that oil? Is that grease?

02:20.130 --> 02:21.690
Down at the shop,
we just call it grime.

02:21.698 --> 02:23.966
Grime.
Look, I know why

02:24.001 --> 02:25.001
you asked me down here.

02:25.002 --> 02:26.969
Oh, you do? Oh. Oh, dear.

02:27.004 --> 02:28.204
Is Kurt acting
strangely at home?

02:28.238 --> 02:29.772
Yeah, since he was two.

02:29.806 --> 02:31.474
Look, I know he's a
little bit different,

02:31.508 --> 02:33.109
but I also think
it's a little early

02:33.143 --> 02:34.343
to be talking about it.

02:34.378 --> 02:35.618
I mean, kids,

02:35.646 --> 02:37.113
they grow out of
stuff all the time.

02:37.147 --> 02:38.781
When I was his age,
I was a Bengals fan.

02:38.815 --> 02:40.316
Now I'm a Browns fan,

02:40.350 --> 02:42.118
all the way.
No, sorry,

02:42.152 --> 02:44.153
I don't think we're talking
about the same thing.

02:44.187 --> 02:47.323
Um, I'm worried
that Kurt is, uh...

02:47.357 --> 02:48.724
depressed.

02:48.759 --> 02:50.126
Oh.
No, deeply.

02:50.160 --> 02:51.694
And I'm concerned about him.

02:51.728 --> 02:55.665
Look, I-I walked in on him,
and he was reading this.

03:07.611 --> 03:08.844
Hey.

03:08.879 --> 03:10.079
What's up?

03:10.113 --> 03:11.981
Nothing.

03:12.015 --> 03:13.649
Is it time for me
to start dinner?

03:13.684 --> 03:15.551
Uh, in a minute.

03:15.585 --> 03:17.353
I, uh...

03:17.387 --> 03:19.747
I got called into school by
your guidance counselor today.

03:22.292 --> 03:27.363
She told me...
some upsetting stuff.

03:27.397 --> 03:29.899
I'm fine, Dad.

03:29.933 --> 03:31.901
She's... she's just
overreacting.

03:31.935 --> 03:33.502
Look, Kurt, I don't want to talk

03:33.537 --> 03:35.738
about this any more
than you do. Okay?

03:35.772 --> 03:38.441
You do your thing, I do mine.

03:38.475 --> 03:43.045
But you're all alone down here,
most of the time.

03:43.080 --> 03:45.014
You don't have any friends.

03:45.048 --> 03:46.248
You don't understand.

03:46.283 --> 03:47.683
School is very complicated
for me.

03:47.718 --> 03:50.453
I was a teenager;
I get the pressure.

03:50.487 --> 03:53.756
Making friends... that's why
I joined the football team.

03:53.790 --> 03:56.259
You want me to join
the football team?

03:56.293 --> 03:57.927
Look, I'm not asking here, Kurt.

03:57.961 --> 03:59.362
This is an order.

03:59.396 --> 04:02.198
By the end of this week,
I want you on a team,

04:02.232 --> 04:04.192
or I'm taking away
the sewing machine.

04:05.902 --> 04:07.870
(school bell ringing)

04:07.904 --> 04:09.906
(lively chatter)

04:31.428 --> 04:33.162
May I sit here?

04:33.196 --> 04:34.597
Be careful with the posters.

04:34.631 --> 04:36.299
They take 20 minutes each
to make.

04:36.333 --> 04:37.600
Okay.

04:37.634 --> 04:39.302
I see you're in the Speech Club.

04:39.336 --> 04:41.070
Speech Club, Renaissance Club,

04:41.104 --> 04:43.239
the Muslim Students Club,
Black Student Union.

04:43.273 --> 04:45.353
It's important for me to be
immersed in all cultures.

04:45.375 --> 04:46.909
I'm an actress.

04:46.944 --> 04:49.111
Oh, I know. I've seen
your videos on MySpace.

04:49.146 --> 04:50.346
You're very talented.

04:50.380 --> 04:52.481
I'm Rachel Berry.

04:52.516 --> 04:54.317
Kurt Hummel.

04:54.351 --> 04:56.752
Well, perhaps I should
join the Speech Club.

04:56.787 --> 04:59.155
My-my dad's making me
join something.

04:59.189 --> 05:00.523
And to be honest with you,
I have also been

05:00.557 --> 05:01.958
toying around
with a career in acting.

05:01.992 --> 05:03.759
I'm not toying around
with anything.

05:03.794 --> 05:05.461
The minute I graduate, I'm
going directly to Broadway

05:05.495 --> 05:07.430
and I'm never looking back.

05:07.464 --> 05:08.998
Besides, you can't join
the Speech Club; it's full.

05:09.032 --> 05:12.168
- Oh.
- Can you carry a tune?

05:12.202 --> 05:13.202
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

05:13.237 --> 05:14.837
- Yes.
- Because I don't know

05:14.871 --> 05:16.439
if you've heard the good
news, but the Glee Club

05:16.473 --> 05:17.840
is starting up again. It was
really awful when that perv,

05:17.874 --> 05:19.208
Mr. Ryerson, was in charge,

05:19.243 --> 05:20.543
but Mr. Schuester
is taking over now.

05:20.577 --> 05:22.144
He's the really
cool Spanish teacher

05:22.179 --> 05:24.146
who looks like an old
Justin Timberlake.

05:24.181 --> 05:25.781
When he was in this school
and he was in the Glee Club,

05:25.816 --> 05:27.550
they won nationals.
Do you know how hard that is?

05:27.584 --> 05:29.352
I'm assuming that you're
a contralto or a mezzo-soprano.

05:29.386 --> 05:31.020
We'll explore your vocal range
tomorrow after school.

05:31.054 --> 05:32.321
I'll reserve the auditorium.

That is definitely the song
that we need to sing

07:45.289 --> 07:46.489
when we audition together.

07:46.523 --> 07:48.257
Together?
I'm sorry, Kurt,

07:48.292 --> 07:49.926
it-it doesn't
work that way.

07:49.960 --> 07:52.161
When you look at the sky
at night, what do you see?

07:52.196 --> 07:53.930
Um... stars?

07:53.964 --> 07:56.032
Exactly.
Some shine brighter than others,

07:56.066 --> 07:57.633
but they all shine on their own.

07:57.668 --> 07:59.268
I enjoyed singing with you today

07:59.303 --> 08:00.837
and I look forward
to doing it again,

08:00.871 --> 08:02.371
but when it comes to auditions,

08:02.406 --> 08:04.474
it's every man for himself
on this stage.

08:04.508 --> 08:05.875
Eat or be eaten.

08:08.178 --> 08:10.913
This is show choir.

08:14.051 --> 08:16.052
(school bell ringing)

08:17.855 --> 08:19.856
Oh! Um, hi.

08:19.890 --> 08:22.124
- Uh, Miss Jones?
- That's me.

08:22.159 --> 08:24.293
I-I'm Kurt Hummel.

08:24.328 --> 08:25.661
Mm-hmm. Kurt Hummel.

08:25.696 --> 08:27.029
And what do you want?

08:27.064 --> 08:28.498
We're walking, we're talking.

08:28.532 --> 08:29.999
Well, I heard that you
were a-a total star

08:30.033 --> 08:31.467
in your church choir
and that you cracked

08:31.502 --> 08:33.034
a stained glass window
when you hit a high note

08:33.070 --> 08:34.904
singing ♪ Jesus. ♪

08:34.938 --> 08:37.140
Well, that's how you get
the big man upstairs' attention.

08:37.174 --> 08:39.654
Well, I want to be
just like you.

08:41.779 --> 08:44.881
Kurt, you are...
you're adorable.

08:44.915 --> 08:46.716
But I just don't think
that this pale, sexy,

08:46.750 --> 08:49.218
Keebler Elf look really fits in
with my church choir.

08:49.253 --> 08:50.486
I mean, no offense.

08:50.521 --> 08:51.721
Oh, no, no.
None taken.

08:51.755 --> 08:52.995
No, no, not a church.

08:53.023 --> 08:54.557
Uh, here, in the new Glee Club.

08:54.591 --> 08:56.259
Haven't you heard?

08:56.293 --> 08:58.828
Why wait for Sundays to be
Aretha Franklin and Beyoncé

08:58.862 --> 09:00.496
and Donna Summer
when you can do it

09:00.531 --> 09:02.698
every day right here at
William McKinley High School?

09:02.733 --> 09:04.233
Miss Jones is listening.

09:04.268 --> 09:05.701
Well, I-I want to audition,

09:05.736 --> 09:07.203
but I'm a-a nobody, you know?

09:07.237 --> 09:09.237
You know, I don't know
what song to sing,

09:09.239 --> 09:10.907
I don't know what to do
with my hands when I'm singing,

09:10.941 --> 09:12.842
I don't know how to
move all cool, like...

09:12.876 --> 09:15.945
like you do, because...
because you're you,

09:15.979 --> 09:18.181
and, well, I'm-I'm...

09:18.215 --> 09:19.849
I'm this.

09:19.883 --> 09:22.585
But inside, I'm-I'm more.

09:22.619 --> 09:24.520
Okay.

09:24.555 --> 09:25.888
I will help.

09:25.923 --> 09:27.256
First tip:

09:27.291 --> 09:29.358
you have an incredibly loud
sense of fashion...

09:29.393 --> 09:30.893
Which, you know, respect.

09:30.928 --> 09:32.728
But I see the way
that you slink around

09:32.763 --> 09:34.363
at this school.
Mm-hmm.

09:34.398 --> 09:36.299
It's time for your attitude
to match your outfits.

09:36.333 --> 09:38.301
I guess I just feel safer

09:38.335 --> 09:40.036
if I let all the clothes
do the talking.

09:40.070 --> 09:41.270
In a way, it lets me
feel invisible.

09:41.305 --> 09:42.738
Not anymore.

09:42.773 --> 09:44.707
I think I might know
the perfect song for you.

09:44.741 --> 09:46.542
KURT:
<i>Hello, I'm Kurt Hummel</i>

09:46.577 --> 09:47.944
<i>and I'll be singing
"Mr. Cellophane."</i>

09:47.978 --> 09:49.578
KURT:
♪ Cellophane ♪

09:49.580 --> 09:51.247
♪ Mr. Cellophane ♪

09:51.281 --> 09:53.983

09:54.017 --> 09:55.918

10:19.276 --> 10:21.677
Thank you. That was...
that was really nice.

10:22.846 --> 10:24.847
(power tools whirring)

10:28.786 --> 10:30.353
KURT:
Hey, Dad!

10:30.387 --> 10:32.088
- I did it.
- Huh?

10:32.122 --> 10:34.757
- I joined a team.
- Hey, hey! All right!

10:34.792 --> 10:36.626
There we go, Kurt!
Which one?

10:36.660 --> 10:38.928
- The Glee Club.
- What's Glee Club?

10:38.962 --> 10:41.097
It's amazing. We-we
sing and we dance

10:41.131 --> 10:44.033
and it's full of inducing
community-based activities.

10:44.067 --> 10:46.202
Look, uh, Kurt...

10:46.236 --> 10:48.204
it's not like I got
a problem with it.

10:48.238 --> 10:52.008
I'm all for singing and dancing,
but the point of this

10:52.042 --> 10:55.211
was for you to feel
what it's like to bond

10:55.245 --> 10:57.380
over a shared goal.

10:57.414 --> 10:59.215
Well, Glee Club
is-is kind of like that.

10:59.249 --> 11:00.883
At the end of the term,
we-we perform

11:00.918 --> 11:02.718
at this big competition
in front of an audience.

11:02.753 --> 11:04.387
Against other schools, you know?

11:04.421 --> 11:06.055
So it really is
like a sports team?

11:06.090 --> 11:07.557
Yeah, yeah, uh, kind of.

11:07.591 --> 11:09.325
Except with choreography
and Beyoncé.

11:09.359 --> 11:11.160
Who's Beyoncé? She one of
the girls on the team?

11:11.195 --> 11:14.197
No, Dad, she's, like, the
biggest pop star in the world.

11:14.231 --> 11:15.798
Oh.
I mean, we-we could use

11:15.833 --> 11:17.734
a-a strong male lead,

11:17.768 --> 11:22.205
but... I really think it's-it's
gonna be something special.

11:22.239 --> 11:24.240
Okay, good.

11:24.274 --> 11:25.908
This is good.

11:25.943 --> 11:27.477
I still think it'd do you good

11:27.511 --> 11:30.179
to be part of
a real sports team, but...

11:30.214 --> 11:31.981
well, you seem happy.

11:32.015 --> 11:37.220
Honestly, Dad, I don't
think I've ever been this

11:37.254 --> 11:39.522
genuinely excited
to go to school.

11:39.556 --> 11:41.624
Thanks for
pushing me to do this.

11:47.431 --> 11:49.911
Thanks for showing up
for yourself.

11:50.701 --> 11:52.001
MAN:
Hey, Burt!

11:52.035 --> 11:53.936
Yeah?

11:56.073 --> 11:57.507
What?

11:57.541 --> 11:59.275
KURT:
<i>I'm gay, Dad.</i>

11:59.309 --> 12:02.011
<i>Please don't stop loving me,
but I'm gay.</i>

12:02.046 --> 12:03.746
We good?

12:03.781 --> 12:05.281
I got to go deal with this.

12:05.315 --> 12:07.583
Yeah... yeah, yeah, we're good.

12:07.618 --> 12:09.285
Okay.

12:12.322 --> 12:13.723
BURT:
Who needs me?

12:20.047 --> 12:22.015
(School bell ringing) MERCEDES: <i>My
name is Mercedes Jones,</i>

12:22.049 --> 12:24.050
<i>and I don't have a lot
of friends at this school.</i>

12:24.085 --> 12:25.565
<i>I mean, it's not like
I get picked on,</i>

12:25.586 --> 12:27.554
<i>and folks are nice, I guess,</i>

12:27.588 --> 12:29.856
<i>but there sure are a lot of
white folks here at McKinley.</i>

12:29.891 --> 12:31.191
<i>I mean, there is
that one black kid,</i>

12:31.225 --> 12:32.392
<i>but he's real boring.</i>

12:32.426 --> 12:33.660
- Hey, Mercedes.
- Yeah. Hi.

12:33.694 --> 12:35.662
<i>I'm a big star at my church,</i>

12:35.696 --> 12:37.197
<i>where everybody knows
I got a big-ass voice,</i>

12:37.231 --> 12:39.065
<i>but here, I'm just a nobody.</i>

12:39.100 --> 12:40.700
<i>But that's all gonna change
real soon</i>

12:40.735 --> 12:42.235
<i>because I heard
they're jump-starting</i>

12:42.270 --> 12:43.837
<i>the singing club at McKinley,</i>

12:43.871 --> 12:47.040
<i>and Mercedes Jones has
decided to sign up.</i>

12:47.074 --> 12:49.609
(school bell ringing)

12:49.644 --> 12:50.644
Excuse me, Mercedes Jones?

12:50.645 --> 12:52.112
Hi, I'm Rachel Berry.

12:52.146 --> 12:54.080
I saw that you signed up
for the Glee Club. Me, too.

12:54.115 --> 12:55.348
I can tell by
your sloppy signature

12:55.383 --> 12:56.783
that you have
a very strong personality,

12:56.817 --> 12:58.585
and I can tell by the way
that you hold your torso

12:58.619 --> 12:59.886
that you have
a very strong diaphragm,

12:59.921 --> 13:01.354
which means that
you're very talented.

13:01.389 --> 13:02.789
Which is good, because
I'm very talented, too.

13:02.824 --> 13:04.224
Well, it's nice to
meet you, Rachel.

13:04.225 --> 13:05.759
Guess I'll be seeing
you in Glee Club.

13:05.793 --> 13:07.594
Here's the thing:
we're both gonna be competing

13:07.628 --> 13:09.796
for the female lead, which I
want us to see as a good thing.

13:09.831 --> 13:10.897
My dads always say: the
person who's better than you,

13:10.932 --> 13:12.532
or maybe, in this case,

13:12.567 --> 13:13.900
maybe the person who's
almost as good as you

13:13.935 --> 13:15.469
should be considered
your best friend.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.237
Okay, let me just stop you
right there, because I can see

13:17.271 --> 13:18.638
what it is you're trying to do.
You're trying to get all

13:18.673 --> 13:20.474
in my head and make me nervous
like Ike Turner

13:20.508 --> 13:22.576
so you can swoop down
and get all the attention.

13:22.610 --> 13:24.244
But let me tell you something.

13:24.278 --> 13:25.645
I've been dealing with
this kind of nonsense

13:25.680 --> 13:27.280
for the past three years
in my church choir,

13:27.315 --> 13:30.250
and I overcame it
and I'm over it.

13:30.284 --> 13:31.818
You go to one of those
singing black churches.

13:31.853 --> 13:33.220
That's amazing.

13:33.254 --> 13:35.822
One of my dads is black.

13:35.857 --> 13:37.757
See? Another thing
that we have in common.

13:37.792 --> 13:39.926
What?
A black dad.

13:39.961 --> 13:42.496
Okay, girl, I got
to go to gym class.

13:45.299 --> 13:47.934
I'd really love to
hear you sing one time.

13:47.969 --> 13:50.303
Maybe I could
come to your church.

13:50.338 --> 13:52.239
Are you serious?

13:52.273 --> 13:54.241
You want to come to my church?

13:54.275 --> 13:56.543

- Yes, sweetie. Okay, take care
of your voice, now. - Okay.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.215
- Okay, bye-bye.
- Mercedes.

16:15.249 --> 16:17.551
I had no idea.
I saw something so special today

16:17.585 --> 16:19.619
that I would not have seen
had you not invited me.

16:19.654 --> 16:21.734
Well, I'm pretty sure
that you invited you,

16:21.756 --> 16:23.676
but I'm glad
that you felt something.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.792
I saw Mercedes Jones,
future R&B star.

16:25.827 --> 16:27.327
Your audience is gonna love you.

16:27.361 --> 16:29.096
Oh, so I hear
what you're saying:

16:29.130 --> 16:30.731
my audience isn't your audience.
I should've known.

16:30.765 --> 16:32.599
Should've known what?

16:32.633 --> 16:34.801
Rachel Berry,
you are officially on notice.

16:34.836 --> 16:38.605
Wherever you think your voice
can go, mine will be there, too.

<i>I'm wildly unpopular,
but I love being unpopular.</i>

16:49.183 --> 16:52.986
<i>I'm trying to be unpopular,

<i>Goths have no time for cliché
bougie high school cliques.</i>

16:56.958 --> 16:58.759
<i>We are the anti-clique.</i>

17:03.898 --> 17:05.832
D-Don't stutter.
It's not n-nice.

17:05.867 --> 17:08.107
TINA: <i> The joke's on you,</i>
<i>Puckerman... my stutter is fake.</i>

17:08.136 --> 17:09.869

<i>could fake a stutter

<i>I could be a big, big star

17:14.976 --> 17:16.810
<i>I need to work on that.

<i>Begone, cheerleaders.</i>

17:24.886 --> 17:27.054
<i>You have no power here.</i>

17:27.088 --> 17:28.822
<i>True power comes from
nonconformity.</i>

17:28.856 --> 17:30.690
<i>That's why I embrace
the avant-garde</i>

<i>She's not only sexy as hell,</i>

17:41.436 --> 17:43.236
<i>she also
treats me like a real person.</i>

17:43.271 --> 17:45.138
<i>Almost everyone else
around here looks at me</i>

17:45.173 --> 17:47.174
<i>like I have terminal cancer
and can somehow spread it</i>

17:47.208 --> 17:50.010
<i>through my wheelchair, but
Tina doesn't look at the chair.</i>

17:50.044 --> 17:52.045
<i>She looks at me.
She jokes with me,</i>

17:52.080 --> 17:53.980
<i>argues with me,
and I know it sounds lame,</i>

17:54.015 --> 17:56.650
<i>but sometimes she even
touches my shoulder or my arm.</i>

17:56.684 --> 17:58.485
<i>It's nice, because
that never happens to me.</i>

17:58.519 --> 17:59.753
<i>She's my best friend.</i>

17:59.787 --> 18:00.921
I love you.

W-W-What?

18:02.423 --> 18:04.424
Nothing.
Uh, let's go eat, woman.

Of course we did it, Autobot,

18:20.541 --> 18:21.575
because you dared us to
and also because

18:21.609 --> 18:22.676
we don't give a what what.

18:22.710 --> 18:23.844
Yeah, and besides,

18:23.878 --> 18:25.078
that Rachel girl had it coming

18:25.113 --> 18:27.514

18:30.651 --> 18:32.285
and I'm allergic
to whatever roadkill he used

18:32.320 --> 18:34.087
to make his tail out of.

18:34.122 --> 18:36.289
Well, she shouldn't have
ditched her otherkin identity.

18:36.324 --> 18:37.591
Quid pro quo, Tina Marie.

18:37.625 --> 18:39.292
W-What does that even m-mean?

18:39.327 --> 18:42.396
Well, Th-that means that
it's your turn to accept a dare,

18:42.430 --> 18:44.564
and I can think of quite a few.

18:44.599 --> 18:46.700
But I think
the most fun of all would be

18:46.734 --> 18:48.735
I dare you and Wheels

18:48.770 --> 18:50.437
to sign up
for the new Glee Club.

18:50.471 --> 18:51.538
Fine. Whatever.

18:51.572 --> 18:52.639
Who even cares?

18:52.674 --> 18:54.074
I sure d-don't.

21:18.796 --> 21:20.063
Thank you. (Chuckles)

21:20.097 --> 21:22.566
- Ginuwine is a badass.
- Artie, that was

21:22.600 --> 21:24.200
r-really, really good.

21:24.235 --> 21:25.702
I had no idea.

21:25.736 --> 21:27.437
- Really?
- Seriously.

21:27.471 --> 21:29.471
That's the best voice
I have ever heard.

21:31.776 --> 21:34.611
(school bell ringing)

21:39.150 --> 21:40.250
Brad.

21:40.284 --> 21:41.952
Welcome, everybody!

21:41.986 --> 21:44.387
Can I just say
what an awesome job

21:44.422 --> 21:47.891
you all did in your auditions.
I was... I was blown away.

21:47.925 --> 21:49.759
Okay, so...

21:49.794 --> 21:52.629
grab a pair of gloves
and some sheet music.

21:52.663 --> 21:55.098
"S-S-S..." "Sit Down,
You're Rockin' the Boat"

21:55.132 --> 21:57.467
by the legendary Frank Loesser.

21:57.501 --> 21:58.869
We did this at
McKinley's Christmas concert

21:58.903 --> 22:00.904
my sophomore year,
and we got a standing O.

22:00.938 --> 22:03.440
Artie, why don't
you take the lead.

22:03.474 --> 22:04.808
- Yes!
- Mr. Schuester.

22:04.842 --> 22:06.276
With all due respect,

22:06.310 --> 22:07.711
I'm the only member here who was

22:07.745 --> 22:09.246
in Mr. Ryerson's
original Glee Club;

22:09.280 --> 22:11.147
therefore, I should be
getting the first solo.

22:11.182 --> 22:13.049
Say what?

22:13.084 --> 22:15.485
It's the first song; it sets
the precedent for everything.

22:15.520 --> 22:17.787
Rachel, Artie's gonna
sing the first solo, period.

22:17.822 --> 22:19.502
You and everyone else
are gonna have plenty

22:19.523 --> 22:22.092
of opportunities for a
solo; we'll all take turns.

22:22.126 --> 22:24.127
In fact, I was thinking
for sectionals, we would do

22:24.161 --> 22:26.930
a medley from <i> Grease.</i>
Who wants the Sandy part?

22:26.964 --> 22:28.832
Is this even a
discussion right now?!

22:28.866 --> 22:30.834
I'm the only person in this room
who can play Sandy!

22:30.868 --> 22:33.069
- Why? Because you're white?
- RACHEL: Okay, I wouldn't dream

22:33.104 --> 22:36.106
of being Mrs. Saigon
or black Dorothy from the Wiz,

22:36.140 --> 22:38.620
but if we want to be taken
seriously as a glee club,

22:38.643 --> 22:40.176
then it can't be about color
or disability or whatever.

22:40.211 --> 22:42.245
It has to be about who
has the best voice.

22:42.280 --> 22:44.281
Exactly. That would be me.

22:47.351 --> 22:48.418
Let's warm up.

22:48.452 --> 22:49.692
Brad.

22:52.723 --> 22:54.724
(vacuum whirring)

22:59.530 --> 23:01.064
(vacuum stops)

23:04.502 --> 23:05.969
I thought you were
finishing up out here?

23:06.003 --> 23:08.004
I-I was just taking
a little break.

23:08.039 --> 23:09.399
You just left
the vacuum cleaner on

23:09.407 --> 23:10.807
so that I would think
you were cleaning

23:10.842 --> 23:12.442
while you were goofing off
with the sheet music.

23:12.476 --> 23:15.278
(sighs) There is a division
of labor in this house, Will.

23:15.313 --> 23:16.813
You do the cooking and cleaning,

23:16.848 --> 23:18.815
and I will carry our children
when we have them.

23:18.850 --> 23:20.517
Which might not be anytime soon

23:20.551 --> 23:22.485
because I'm sure all this
extra free work you're doing

23:22.520 --> 23:24.020
for the Glee Club
is tiring you out

23:24.055 --> 23:25.789
and making your sperm stressed.

23:25.823 --> 23:27.190
You're right.

23:27.225 --> 23:29.192
I am stressed.

23:29.227 --> 23:32.028
And I'm sure my sperm's stressed, too.
Mm-hmm.

23:32.063 --> 23:34.130
The Glee Club is one day old,
and there's already in-fighting.

23:34.165 --> 23:36.733
(sighs) Which is
kind of my fault,

23:36.767 --> 23:38.368
because I asked
who wanted the first solo,

23:38.402 --> 23:40.337
and Rachel and Mercedes
both raised their hands,

23:40.371 --> 23:41.838
and I don't want to
disappoint either of them.

23:41.873 --> 23:43.874
Just give it to whichever one
is the most pathetic.

23:43.908 --> 23:46.309
It's much harder to be jealous
of someone when you think

23:46.344 --> 23:47.911
you're better than they are.

23:47.945 --> 23:49.813
Even if they get something
that you want.

23:49.847 --> 23:51.414
I love it when you're all smart.

23:51.449 --> 23:53.016
Oh. (Giggles)

23:55.953 --> 23:58.421
I'm only gonna
ask you this once,

23:58.456 --> 24:01.725
and then I promise I will never
bring up the Glee Club again.

24:01.759 --> 24:04.060
Okay.

24:04.095 --> 24:06.229
Is it worth it?

24:06.264 --> 24:07.864
I mean, you know
I'm a little bit psychic.

24:07.899 --> 24:09.566
I have a bad feeling about this.

24:09.600 --> 24:12.369
How could anything bad
come out of a glee club?

24:12.403 --> 24:14.571
Because look how distracted
you are by it already.

24:14.605 --> 24:17.374
What if you end up spending
so much time with the glee kids

24:17.408 --> 24:19.376
that you start neglecting
our time together?

24:19.410 --> 24:21.211
I don't want to become
one of those ignored wives

24:21.245 --> 24:22.279
who has an affair.

24:22.313 --> 24:24.915
You are the love of my life.

24:24.949 --> 24:28.385
And nothing is ever gonna
take you away from me.

24:32.557 --> 24:34.157
Good.

24:35.455 --> 24:37.589
Mr. Schuester, how's the search for
our male lead going?

24:37.623 --> 24:40.392
I took the initiative of making
a list of potential candidates

24:40.426 --> 24:41.893
- based on their yearbook photos.
- Um, thanks, Rachel.

24:41.928 --> 24:43.762
But I was actually headed
to the locker room

24:43.796 --> 24:46.098
- to see if, uh, any of the football
players signed up. - Great.

24:46.132 --> 24:47.532
I also made a list
of all the reasons

24:47.567 --> 24:49.034
why I should be getting
the first solo.

24:49.068 --> 24:50.402
I think it would make
an important statement

24:50.436 --> 24:51.937
to the rest of the team
if you told them

24:51.971 --> 24:54.451
right at the beginning
that I'm the star.

24:55.241 --> 24:57.709
Oh, my God.

24:57.744 --> 24:59.077
A-Are you okay?

24:59.112 --> 25:01.213
(laughter)

25:01.247 --> 25:03.215
I told you.

25:03.249 --> 25:05.417
Everyone hates me.

25:05.451 --> 25:07.219
(school bell ringing)

25:07.253 --> 25:08.820
Everybody up!

25:08.855 --> 25:10.622
We're moving to the auditorium.

25:10.657 --> 25:11.990
Alcoholics Anonymous
has the auditorium.

25:12.025 --> 25:13.291
Not anymore.

25:13.326 --> 25:15.060
Principal Figgins
believes in us so much,

25:15.094 --> 25:16.294
he's giving it to us.

25:16.329 --> 25:18.096
For a while.

25:18.131 --> 25:20.966
Let's go. And grab a copy of
"You're the One That I Want."

25:21.000 --> 25:22.467
Hold up, who gets
to sing the Sandy part?

25:22.502 --> 25:24.036
Rachel.

25:25.104 --> 25:26.672
Are you serious?

25:26.706 --> 25:29.107
I can blow the roof
off that auditorium.

25:29.142 --> 25:30.742
Her little bitty Jewish voice
won't make it

25:30.777 --> 25:32.511
- past the third row.
- Racist!

25:32.545 --> 25:34.946
And untrue. I can belt just
as good as you, better even.

25:34.981 --> 25:36.948
Oh, really?
Well, let's prove it.

25:36.983 --> 25:39.484
Let's have a sing-off
right here, right now.

25:39.519 --> 25:41.253
We're not having a sing-off!

25:41.287 --> 25:43.255
Although that's not a bad idea
for a future exercise.

25:43.289 --> 25:45.357
Rachel has this solo.

25:45.391 --> 25:46.658
Like I said,
you'll all take turns.

25:46.693 --> 25:48.627
Except the white girl
goes first.

25:48.661 --> 25:50.696
The white girl
always goes first.

25:50.730 --> 25:52.164
(sobbing softly)

25:58.204 --> 26:00.205
Hey.

26:03.343 --> 26:05.344
I didn't get the solo.

26:07.347 --> 26:11.717
I lost it to that demented
little Beanie Baby.

26:11.751 --> 26:15.187
Mr. Schuester is never
gonna give me a solo.

26:15.221 --> 26:17.389
It's a waste of time;
I'm gonna quit.

26:17.423 --> 26:20.726
Nobody in there is gonna see me
the way that I see myself.

26:20.760 --> 26:22.728
Mercedes.

26:22.762 --> 26:24.029
You are so young.

26:24.063 --> 26:26.331
Glee Club just started.

26:26.333 --> 26:28.467
Who knows
what your future holds?

26:28.501 --> 26:30.969
Mercedes,

26:31.004 --> 26:34.206
you are a star.

26:34.240 --> 26:36.208
But part of the responsibility

26:36.242 --> 26:38.176
that goes along
with being a star

26:38.211 --> 26:41.246
is learning to share
the spotlight.

26:41.281 --> 26:45.150
Maybe she's gonna get the solos

26:45.184 --> 26:47.486
because she needs it more
than you do right now.

26:47.520 --> 26:51.189
Truth is, Mercedes, Rachel
will make you better.

26:51.224 --> 26:53.425
Her drive and ambition

26:53.459 --> 26:56.261
will help you raise
your expectations of yourself,

26:56.296 --> 26:58.730
and you can use that
to become great.

26:58.765 --> 27:00.732
And I have a feeling

27:00.767 --> 27:02.868
you two are gonna
become great friends.

27:02.902 --> 27:04.202
(scoffs)

27:04.237 --> 27:05.937
(sniffles)

27:05.972 --> 27:08.440
Stars have a way
of finding each other.

27:08.474 --> 27:10.309
Okay, come here.

27:12.312 --> 27:14.279
(school bell ringing)

27:14.314 --> 27:15.547
There you go, Sue.

27:15.581 --> 27:16.949
Some principals would say

27:16.983 --> 27:20.052
that importing a rare silk
trampoline mat

27:20.086 --> 27:23.622
from China is an extravagance,
but not this principal.

27:23.656 --> 27:26.858
The Cheerios! Are McKinley
High's number one priority.

27:26.893 --> 27:29.094
Oh, thank you so much,
Principal Figgins.

27:29.128 --> 27:30.762
I could have never
led my Cheerios!

27:30.797 --> 27:34.399
To a record five consecutive
national championships

27:34.434 --> 27:36.301
without you.
(chuckles)

27:36.336 --> 27:38.303
Actually, I could have done it
very easily without you.

27:38.338 --> 27:40.619
Oh, uh, and that reminds me.
I have a question for you.

27:40.640 --> 27:42.040
Hmm?

27:42.075 --> 27:43.909
What exactly is going on
with Will Schuester

27:43.943 --> 27:45.377
taking over the show choir?

27:45.411 --> 27:47.212
The Glee Club?

27:47.246 --> 27:49.915
Why, Sue, that's nothing
but a trifling.

27:49.949 --> 27:51.917
Well, I just want to be clear
that the star performers

27:51.951 --> 27:53.919
at this high school
are my Cheerios!,

27:53.953 --> 27:55.821
and I should hope
it remains that way.

27:55.855 --> 27:57.456
Oh, Sue, don't worry.

27:57.490 --> 28:00.926
You are my star.
You are on Fox Sports Net.

28:00.960 --> 28:02.894
- Yes. - And besides, show
choir won't last.

28:02.929 --> 28:06.598
Will only has five students,
one of them a cripple.

28:06.633 --> 28:08.767
And children these days
aren't interested

28:08.801 --> 28:11.136
in singing to each other.

28:11.170 --> 28:14.239
They're too busy with
their Friendster and Myspace

28:14.274 --> 28:15.741
and Blockbuster Video.

28:15.775 --> 28:17.676
These are things
that are here to stay.

28:17.710 --> 28:19.411
Well, I don't know.

28:19.445 --> 28:23.248
I have a bad feeling
about this Glee Club.

28:23.283 --> 28:25.550
(school bell ringing)

28:27.820 --> 28:29.621
(cheering)

28:31.624 --> 28:33.125
Come on, go!

28:33.159 --> 28:34.593
Okay, come on.

28:34.627 --> 28:36.495
Traveling.

28:36.529 --> 28:38.931
Hey!

28:38.965 --> 28:40.933
Hey, you know, because
we're best friends,

28:40.967 --> 28:43.001
I want to ask you something frankly.
Sure.

28:43.036 --> 28:44.436
Wait, I-I'm your
best friend?

28:44.470 --> 28:46.638
I-I know nothing about you.
We hardly even talk.

28:46.673 --> 28:48.440
We just play basketball
once a week.

28:48.474 --> 28:50.208
Yeah, like I said, best friends.

28:50.243 --> 28:51.443
(sighs)

28:51.477 --> 28:53.278
What are your...
Thank you.

28:53.313 --> 28:55.280
What are your intentions
with this Glee Club?

28:55.315 --> 28:56.481
Intentions?
I don't know.

28:56.516 --> 28:58.150
I guess we'll have to find out.

28:58.184 --> 28:59.551
I don't know, I just...

28:59.586 --> 29:01.553
I look around this school,
I see all these kids

29:01.588 --> 29:02.988
who don't have the arts
in their lives,

29:03.022 --> 29:04.990
and I want them
to have what I had...

29:05.024 --> 29:07.392
A place where they can go
to experience the joy of music.

29:07.427 --> 29:09.161
Yeah, well, they already
have that, William.

29:09.195 --> 29:11.396
It's called the iPod.
I don't know, being a part

29:11.431 --> 29:13.465
of Glee Club was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

29:13.499 --> 29:15.400
Now you're a high school
Spanish teacher.

29:15.435 --> 29:16.668
(laughs)

29:16.703 --> 29:18.470
Will, the students
at this school

29:18.504 --> 29:19.905
aren't going to
become performers.

29:19.939 --> 29:21.240
They're not gonna become
professional singers

29:21.274 --> 29:22.708
or dancers or actors.

29:22.742 --> 29:24.643
They'll be fry cooks
and auto mechanics.

29:24.677 --> 29:27.479
And it's really unfair of you
to suggest anything otherwise.

29:27.513 --> 29:31.250
Fostering unrealistic dreams
in these kids will accomplish

29:31.284 --> 29:33.018
absolutely nothing
but to make their lives

29:33.052 --> 29:36.321
that much more dark
and depressing.

29:36.356 --> 29:39.191
I'm sorry, Sue.
I just disagree.

29:39.225 --> 29:41.159
I mean, the arts are important.

29:41.194 --> 29:43.495
Certainly more important
than cheerleading.

29:43.530 --> 29:44.897
(quietly):
How dare you.

29:44.931 --> 29:46.565
And I think,
with a little hard work,

29:46.599 --> 29:48.700
this Glee Club could
really accomplish something.

29:48.735 --> 29:50.736
I got Finn Hudson to sign up,

29:50.770 --> 29:53.005
and he's the captain
of the football team, so...

29:53.039 --> 29:54.706
who knows
what our future could hold?

29:54.741 --> 29:57.376
I'm gonna give you an
ultimatum, William.

29:57.410 --> 29:58.911
You either drop this Glee Club,

29:58.945 --> 30:01.213
or you and I will cease
to be friends.

30:01.247 --> 30:02.807
(chuckles):
What?

30:04.317 --> 30:05.717
Are you serious?

30:05.752 --> 30:07.185
You do not want to make

30:07.220 --> 30:09.588
an enemy out of Sue Sylvester.

30:09.622 --> 30:11.456
You don't want to do that.

30:18.164 --> 30:19.965
Sorry, Sue.

30:20.567 --> 30:22.634
No deal.

31:40.236 --> 31:43.304
I am very aware that it is the
job off the assistant manager

31:43.339 --> 31:46.541
to stock the novelty sheets,
Howard, but I am pregnant,

31:46.575 --> 31:49.043
and my doctor says I
need to take it easy.

31:49.078 --> 31:51.045
- Are you on bed rest?
- Oh, not officially,

31:51.080 --> 31:52.547
but I'm sure I will
be soon enough.

31:52.581 --> 31:54.341
And even sooner,
if you keep stressing me out

31:54.350 --> 31:56.310
by complaining that you can't
do my job right now.

31:56.318 --> 31:58.219
No, no, no, I-I'm sorry.

31:58.254 --> 32:01.689
I'll-I'll just give up sleeping
for a while to get it all done.

32:01.724 --> 32:03.191
(sighs)

32:03.225 --> 32:05.059
Mrs. Schuester,
I'm Rachel Berry.

32:05.094 --> 32:06.461
I'm one of
your husband's students,

32:06.495 --> 32:07.695
Glee Club specifically.

32:07.730 --> 32:10.465
- I'm working.
- First of all,

32:10.499 --> 32:12.233
I just wanted to congratulate
you on your new addition.

32:12.268 --> 32:14.035
I can tell that you already
have the pregnancy glow.

32:14.069 --> 32:15.904
Oh. Thank you.

32:15.938 --> 32:17.806
Second of all, I just wanted to
ask you to reconsider guilting

32:17.840 --> 32:20.542
your husband into quitting his
job and becoming an accountant.

32:20.576 --> 32:23.311
Here's what I've learned in the
years since I left high school.

32:23.345 --> 32:25.413
There's who you are, and
there's who you think you are.

32:25.448 --> 32:27.715
And your level of
personal misery is determined

32:27.750 --> 32:29.851
by how big the gap is
between them.

32:29.885 --> 32:33.488
It's my job as a wife to help
my husband see who he really is,

32:33.522 --> 32:36.257
rather than going after
who he thinks he ought to be.

32:36.292 --> 32:38.226
That's how I keep him happy.

32:38.260 --> 32:40.829
But isn't the point of life to
imagine yourself doing something

32:40.863 --> 32:43.331
greater, then working hard
to achieve all of your dreams?

32:43.365 --> 32:45.100
Yes, if it's realistic.

32:45.134 --> 32:47.936
See, I want a bigger house,
and I want to decorate it

32:47.970 --> 32:49.370
with the entire catalog
from Pottery Barn,

32:49.405 --> 32:51.239
and I can have those things.

32:51.273 --> 32:54.509
But not if I'm gonna let Will
ruin it by chasing after a dream

32:54.543 --> 32:56.511
that doesn't change our lives
in any measurable way.

32:56.545 --> 32:58.379
Oh, but he would be helping...
Mainly me...

32:58.414 --> 32:59.948
To achieve my full potential.

32:59.982 --> 33:01.616
That's not gonna help
Mama buy personalized.

33:01.650 --> 33:03.952
Mr. and Mrs. throw pillows
from the monogram shop.

33:03.986 --> 33:07.922
Do not put the plush blankets
with the novelty sheets!

33:11.560 --> 33:14.229
You're stressing out my baby.

33:16.398 --> 33:17.766
Mrs. Schuester,

33:17.800 --> 33:19.300
I am begging you to reconsider.

33:19.335 --> 33:20.935
Mr. Schuester listens to you.

33:20.970 --> 33:22.604
Yes, because he's my husband.

33:22.638 --> 33:25.940
And it is my job to bring
structure to our family,

33:25.975 --> 33:28.810
and his job to do as I say.

33:31.514 --> 33:34.949
I always wanted to be in
an all-male a Capella group.

33:35.985 --> 33:38.420
I guess my dream is dead, too.

33:42.691 --> 33:45.093
First the almighty Finn
Hudson joins Glee Club,

33:45.127 --> 33:47.562
and everyone rejoices
like he's baby Jesus.

33:47.596 --> 33:49.230
Then he quits, then he rejoins,

33:49.265 --> 33:51.266
then he immediately
starts bossing us around

33:51.300 --> 33:53.860
like we're his slaves, and we're
supposed to be happy about that?

33:53.869 --> 33:55.437
We need him though, Kurt.

33:55.471 --> 33:57.238
Why? Because
he's popular?

33:57.273 --> 33:58.907
No, he's not only popular.

33:58.941 --> 34:01.443
He's at the top of the damn
McKinley High food chain.

34:01.477 --> 34:03.912
But I don't know...
Maybe he needs us, too.

34:03.946 --> 34:05.814
Oh, yeah, sure. The guy
with the perfect life

34:05.848 --> 34:07.649
needs to hang out with
the damaged goods.

34:07.683 --> 34:08.817
Who you calling "damaged goods"?

34:08.851 --> 34:10.418
No one!

34:10.453 --> 34:12.286
I'm just saying that
I don't trust him.

34:12.321 --> 34:14.856
I mean, he already gets
everything that he wants.

34:14.889 --> 34:17.592
What is he doing barging into
our club and taking it over?

34:17.626 --> 34:19.928
Mark my words, he's gonna get

34:19.962 --> 34:21.601
some jocks and some
Cheerios! To join him,

34:21.630 --> 34:23.665
and then we are
gonna get pushed out.

34:23.699 --> 34:24.866
Oh, no.

34:24.900 --> 34:26.134
Nobody pushes out
Mercedes Jones.

34:26.168 --> 34:28.369
Or Kurt Hummel.
I will not allow it.

34:28.404 --> 34:30.105
No, sir.

34:30.139 --> 34:32.873
You know, now that
I think about it,

34:32.908 --> 34:34.943
he was pretty bossy today.

34:34.976 --> 34:37.478
I cannot believe he convinced
me to make our costumes.

34:37.513 --> 34:39.447
Oh, by the way,
if you need help with that,

34:39.482 --> 34:40.949
I'm more than happy to pitch in.

34:40.983 --> 34:42.650
You can't go wrong
with red and denim.

34:42.685 --> 34:45.165
How did you become so
smart and adorable?

34:46.355 --> 34:48.489
(both laugh)

34:48.524 --> 34:50.458
Oh.

34:50.493 --> 34:52.193
Baby, can you hand
me some sugar?

34:52.228 --> 34:53.628
Oh.

34:53.661 --> 34:55.163
Sure.

34:55.197 --> 34:56.831
Thanks!

34:56.866 --> 34:58.533
You're the only openly
gay person I know.

34:58.567 --> 34:59.734
That is so brave of you.

34:59.769 --> 35:01.403
Well, coming out was

35:01.437 --> 35:02.737
the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

35:02.772 --> 35:04.639
But I'm telling you
it feels so nice

35:04.673 --> 35:06.541
to not be living a lie anymore.

35:06.575 --> 35:08.143
So what about you, Joby?

35:08.177 --> 35:09.677
Are you thinking about
coming out anytime soon?

35:09.712 --> 35:11.513
What? I-I'm not gay.

35:11.547 --> 35:12.881
I'm straight as an arrow.

35:12.915 --> 35:14.315
I'm attracted to women.

35:14.350 --> 35:15.350
Obviously, of course.

35:15.384 --> 35:17.052
Um, I-I had no idea, I...

35:17.086 --> 35:19.254
I mean, it's obvious
that Rachel's only

35:19.288 --> 35:21.189
letting him stay in the club
because she has

35:21.223 --> 35:22.757
a fat crush on him.

35:22.792 --> 35:23.992
KURT:
<i>So do you. No, I don't.</i>

35:24.026 --> 35:25.860
<i>Oh, get real, you do, too.</i>

35:25.895 --> 35:27.328
Yeah, maybe you're right.

35:27.363 --> 35:30.231
Maybe having Finn Hudson around
is a mistake.

35:30.266 --> 35:32.701
I'm gonna call
an emergency meeting.

35:38.518 --> 35:40.519
And another thing... he wants us
to do "Don't Stop Believin'."

35:40.553 --> 35:41.787
Our audience is
gonna think we're doing

35:41.821 --> 35:43.255
a salute to <i> The Sopranos</i> finale.

35:43.289 --> 35:46.024
- You guys started without me?
- Uh, hell yeah, Berry.

35:46.059 --> 35:47.593
- You're, like, ten minutes late.
- You're lucky that I came

35:47.627 --> 35:49.461
at all and I don't think
that we should be having

35:49.496 --> 35:51.663
emergency meetings without all
of our members, including Finn.

35:51.698 --> 35:53.298
That's what this is about.

35:53.333 --> 35:55.267
Okay, we're having
second thoughts about him.

35:55.301 --> 35:56.802
For the record,
not all of us are.

35:56.836 --> 35:58.337
Okay, we can't kick him out.

35:58.371 --> 36:00.272
I just personally
persuaded him to come back.

36:00.306 --> 36:02.508
Them personally
persuade him to quit.

36:02.542 --> 36:05.144
It shouldn't be that difficult.
He's already quit once before.

36:05.178 --> 36:06.678
Look, it's obvious that Artie

36:06.713 --> 36:09.782
and I don't fit your idea
of a proper leading man.

36:09.816 --> 36:12.618
And honestly I don't care, but
he shouldn't be an evil jock.

36:12.652 --> 36:14.319
I don't think
that Finn Hudson is evil.

36:14.354 --> 36:16.155
Now, his girlfriend,
Quinn Fabray?

36:16.189 --> 36:17.189
She's a grade-A bitch.

36:17.223 --> 36:19.024
Hey, all I know

36:19.059 --> 36:21.894
is that when the jocks locked
me in that nasty Porta-Potty,

36:21.928 --> 36:23.996
Finn Hudson rescued me.

36:24.030 --> 36:26.298
Then, after rehearsal,
he wheeled me home.

36:26.332 --> 36:29.301
<i>He wheeled me all the way home,</i>

36:29.335 --> 36:30.903
<i>and he told my mom what happened</i>

36:30.937 --> 36:32.638
<i>and he apologized to her.</i>

36:32.672 --> 36:34.540
So, he's not evil.

36:34.574 --> 36:37.242
Not by a long shot.
He's never called me fat.

36:37.277 --> 36:39.378
I mean, that's better than most
of the jerks at this school.

36:39.412 --> 36:41.513
I guess when I got tossed
into the Dumpster,

36:41.548 --> 36:43.549
he let me take off
my Marc Jacobs jacket.

36:43.583 --> 36:45.250
That was kind of nice.

36:45.285 --> 36:47.986
He is awfully c-cute.

36:48.021 --> 36:51.356
Maybe he's not
that different than us.

36:51.391 --> 36:52.658
Maybe he just

36:52.692 --> 36:54.493
wants to be accepted
for who he is

36:54.527 --> 36:56.528
and not for
what people label him as.

36:56.563 --> 36:58.530
And if we start
excluding people,

36:58.565 --> 37:01.133
then we're no different
than the people who exclude us.

37:03.236 --> 37:06.872
So far, my time
at McKinley has sucked.

37:06.906 --> 37:09.808
But... not this week.

37:11.811 --> 37:14.079
I made some friends.

37:14.114 --> 37:16.715
And that's always been
really hard for me.

37:18.418 --> 37:21.520
I don't know what's gonna happen
with this club,

37:21.554 --> 37:23.522
but...

37:23.556 --> 37:25.858
maybe it'll be
something special.

37:25.892 --> 37:27.693
Maybe it'll be

37:27.727 --> 37:30.596
somewhere safe where we can...

37:30.630 --> 37:33.432
learn from each other
and be who we are,

37:33.466 --> 37:36.301
including people
who are different than us.

37:36.336 --> 37:39.204
When we look back
on our time here,

37:39.239 --> 37:41.040
we should be proud.

37:41.074 --> 37:45.244
For what we did
and-and who we included.

37:47.514 --> 37:49.982
All in favor of keeping Finn
in the Glee Club?

37:50.984 --> 37:52.051
Aye.

37:52.085 --> 37:52.818
Aye.

37:52.852 --> 37:53.852
Aye.

37:55.522 --> 37:57.956
Aye.

37:59.693 --> 38:02.628
Aye.

38:02.662 --> 38:04.329
For the last time,
my hands are tied.

38:04.364 --> 38:06.665
I can't offer Will Schuester
a raise to run a club

38:06.700 --> 38:09.568
that no one cares about
and has only six members!

38:09.602 --> 38:11.303
Fine, then we're gonna lose Will
Schuester, and it's gonna be

38:11.337 --> 38:12.971
under your leadership
that McKinley High becomes

38:13.006 --> 38:14.773
the most recent in a very long
line of public schools

38:14.808 --> 38:17.609
that offer no performing arts
whatsoever!

38:17.644 --> 38:20.012
And that's a fact
that wounds me deeply,

38:20.046 --> 38:23.182
neurotic, adorable Guidance
Counselor Emma Pillsbury.

38:23.216 --> 38:26.318
I can't offer Will
Schuester more money,

38:26.353 --> 38:28.887
but I can offer him
something better.

38:29.956 --> 38:33.993
A precious adolescent memory.

38:34.027 --> 38:35.694
I scoured McKinley's archives

38:35.729 --> 38:37.463
and found this footage

38:37.497 --> 38:41.867
of the 1993 National Show Choir
Championship

38:41.901 --> 38:46.805

William Schuester.

39:24.444 --> 39:26.679
I just heard the great news.

39:26.713 --> 39:28.981
Oh, thanks. Yeah.
Terri and I are really excited.

39:29.015 --> 39:30.816
We've been talking
about kids for a while.

39:30.850 --> 39:33.385
No, not that news. Knocking
somebody up isn't difficult

39:33.420 --> 39:35.587
and hardly merits
a congratulations.

39:35.622 --> 39:37.556
No, I'm talking about
your other news,

39:37.590 --> 39:39.692
your leaving the profession
of teaching.

39:39.726 --> 39:41.727
Oh, uh... You know, to
be honest with you,

39:41.761 --> 39:43.395
teaching is for losers.

39:43.430 --> 39:45.910
Nope, accounting is the
career for you. Oh, hey,

39:45.932 --> 39:48.534
- I got you a going away present.
- An abacus.

39:48.568 --> 39:51.370
Yeah, the Orientals say it's
easier than a calculator,

39:51.404 --> 39:54.206
which is an obvious lie designed
to make us feel inferior.

39:54.240 --> 39:57.776
Oh, and here's five years
worth of receipts

39:57.811 --> 39:59.545
in no particular order.

39:59.579 --> 40:01.780

40:01.815 --> 40:04.049

of bikini waxes in there
