WEBVTT

00:20.977 --> 00:22.483
Are you sure this is safe?

00:22.483 --> 00:24.202
Good all the time, man!

00:26.311 --> 00:27.840
Chill, let's go.

00:30.120 --> 00:30.994
All right

00:31.357 --> 00:32.932
Hey Mike, Mike, Mike

00:33.400 --> 00:34.819
I don't know about this, man

00:34.819 --> 00:36.380
I'm going out on a limb here man.

00:36.380 --> 00:40.133
If you don't have a stone for this,then you
definitely don't have them for the rest of your story

00:40.133 --> 00:41.455
Ok

00:48.223 --> 00:49.135
All right.

00:49.135 --> 00:50.825
Yeah, let's, let's do it.

00:51.920 --> 00:53.478
Hold on, Hold on,

00:53.478 --> 00:55.155
See man? Everything's cool / Yeah

01:34.864 --> 01:36.943
Alex? / Horatio?

01:37.137 --> 01:38.712
Yeah!

01:43.599 --> 01:45.468
Who let the press in?

01:45.686 --> 01:47.057
The kid's our witness.

01:47.057 --> 01:50.022
And the witness is
taking a note, huh,

01:52.578 --> 01:55.812
interesting...
Alex, what do we have here?

01:56.694 --> 01:59.442
The boy took two rounds
through the wood.

02:00.849 --> 02:03.697
Through the wood?
You mean the door was closed.

02:03.697 --> 02:05.152
That's interesting.

02:05.152 --> 02:06.640
Excuse me

02:08.067 --> 02:09.544
Could I have a word with you?

02:09.544 --> 02:11.260
Yeah, Josh Dalton, Miami Sun.

02:11.260 --> 02:13.413
Yes, formerly of the Miami Ledger.

02:13.525 --> 02:15.366
- You're a fan.
- Let me put it this way.

02:15.366 --> 02:19.194
I am familiar with some of the pieces that
you've written about my department.

02:19.194 --> 02:21.037
Oh, right.

02:21.037 --> 02:25.870
The story on the false positives
at the CSI lab a few years back.

02:25.870 --> 02:28.516
Hit below the belt. I was green.

02:28.516 --> 02:31.639
- Weren't we all?
- Well, I learned a lot since then.

02:32.199 --> 02:34.484
So you have any idea
what caliber was used?

02:34.484 --> 02:36.780
Josh,

02:36.780 --> 02:40.763
how this works is I ask you the questions
and you provide me with the information.

02:40.763 --> 02:43.250
So let's start with
what you were doing here.

02:43.250 --> 02:46.364
Keeping my finger
on the drug fueled pulse of Miami

02:46.364 --> 02:47.997
Sounds like a by-line

02:48.561 --> 02:50.842
Mike was hooking me up for an expos?.

02:50.966 --> 02:53.345
He works for District Councilman.

02:53.524 --> 02:55.821
People love stories of urban blight.

02:55.942 --> 02:57.603
Makes'em feel human.

02:57.726 --> 02:59.581
But not you though, huh?

03:00.203 --> 03:04.660
I just saw my friend murdered,
and I never felt more human in my life.

03:10.500 --> 03:11.748
What you find?

03:11.748 --> 03:15.748
I believe this is your pen cap, isn't it?

03:17.429 --> 03:19.600
When did you have time to take notes?

03:19.691 --> 03:22.098
After I called the police.

03:22.235 --> 03:24.956
Ah, really. Was Mike still alive?

03:25.071 --> 03:26.882
Of course not.

03:26.882 --> 03:27.897
What do you think I am?

03:27.897 --> 03:32.224
I think that you're
a man in search of story

04:07.476 --> 04:10.297
MIAMI
2x19 Deadline

04:24.638 --> 04:28.865
Well, it's not often that shooter
doesn't get to see his own victim.

04:30.085 --> 04:32.281
With.38, you don't have to.

04:33.736 --> 04:38.721
Cuts through your typical single
panel door with practically no resistance.

04:38.721 --> 04:40.217
Left the gun.

04:41.830 --> 04:43.223
M 11.

04:43.223 --> 04:44.874
That's smart.

04:44.874 --> 04:47.918
If we can't find any prints on it,
we can't tie him to it.

04:49.312 --> 04:52.075
What is this place anyway?
Some sort of inner city drug store?

04:52.075 --> 04:55.197
Well, they don't keep the dope
on the premises, but a..

04:55.197 --> 04:57.381
it's all kinds of evidence of use.

05:02.429 --> 05:06.244
If we find out what's in this baggage,
narrow down our dealer.

05:11.056 --> 05:14.671
You looking for me? / Yeah, do you have
the want to ones from the crime scene door?

05:14.671 --> 05:16.755
Wide, medium and close.

05:16.755 --> 05:18.928
The spray pattern is right to left.

05:18.928 --> 05:20.999
Two hit our victim, and
three hit the back wall

05:20.999 --> 05:22.948
So they hit the back wall,

05:22.948 --> 05:24.698
but not the journalist.

05:26.168 --> 05:28.545
So Josh,

05:28.545 --> 05:30.156
why were you there?

05:30.156 --> 05:32.273
I told you, a story

05:32.273 --> 05:36.175
Is it possible that
you took Mike there

05:36.175 --> 05:38.668
to set him up to be killed?

05:39.090 --> 05:40.949
I covered it, I didn't create it.

05:40.949 --> 05:44.387
No, that doesn't explain
why you weren't shot, does it?

05:44.502 --> 05:46.825
I guess it was just a luck

05:48.293 --> 05:50.200
Ah, yes.

05:50.200 --> 05:52.575
Luck.

05:52.665 --> 05:55.262
This, Josh, is a crime scene photograph.

05:55.262 --> 05:56.744
Now, you claim...

05:56.744 --> 06:00.559
that you were to Mike's immediate
right as he knocked on the door, right?

06:00.559 --> 06:02.264
Yeah, immediately to his right, yes.

06:02.264 --> 06:03.896
Okay, here's why it doesn't fly.

06:03.896 --> 06:06.957
This is called a bullet spray.

06:06.957 --> 06:12.628
Now that technically makes it
impossible for you to be on Mike's right.

06:13.691 --> 06:18.638
I think you were standing
behind him shielding yourself.

06:18.930 --> 06:20.952
Yeah, let's do it.

06:22.197 --> 06:24.129
See man? Everything's cool.

06:29.602 --> 06:31.511
Ok,

06:31.511 --> 06:38.946
I heard him rock around, and
instinctively I just, moved behind Mike.

06:39.150 --> 06:41.246
You seem pretty familiar with weapons.

06:41.246 --> 06:43.691
Yeah, I did a whole story
couple of years ago

06:43.691 --> 06:46.681
on gunrunners
between here and Caribbean.

06:46.681 --> 06:52.818
How they use cruise ships to transfer major
weapons to Al-Quaeda sleepers in the Miami area.

06:52.818 --> 06:54.137
I remember the story.

06:54.137 --> 06:59.024
I went to a gun range, just to, you know
get comfortable with weapons.

06:59.024 --> 07:00.905
And you learn pretty quickly.

07:00.905 --> 07:03.639
The distinctive sound of action of gun.

07:04.936 --> 07:07.106
- Hold on.
- See man? Everything's cool.

07:16.672 --> 07:19.120
It was second nature.

07:19.291 --> 07:21.806
There was no set-up.

07:26.477 --> 07:29.770
I give subjects the face
I think they're lying.

07:30.088 --> 07:31.516
But I'm not.

07:31.516 --> 07:34.378
I don't know how
else to convince you.

07:34.378 --> 07:36.662
You know what Josh?
I wouldn't worry about it.

07:36.662 --> 07:40.559
I have many ways to get the truth.

07:48.755 --> 07:50.391
Calleigh, check this out.

07:53.714 --> 07:56.301
See these paint chips
on top of the newspaper?

07:57.480 --> 07:58.696
Yeah.

07:59.005 --> 08:00.686
The killer probably went out this way,

08:00.686 --> 08:03.305
but he wasn't counting
on the window being painted shut.

08:07.857 --> 08:09.823
Someone tried to force that open.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.638
The handles are too narrow for prints,
what about underneath?

08:12.638 --> 08:14.586
Exactly. Take a look.

08:17.312 --> 08:21.421
What are the chances of drug dealer
from the golden triangle being on AFIS?

08:21.421 --> 08:22.667
Good.

08:22.667 --> 08:25.531
It's great.

08:27.423 --> 08:28.766
There it is.

08:28.766 --> 08:30.557
Bobby Jeter.

08:30.557 --> 08:33.518
He's been in and out of stock
since he was of age.

08:33.614 --> 08:35.554
Most possession and dealing.

08:35.554 --> 08:38.731
No murder. / Might just
have broken a new ground.

08:40.828 --> 08:43.544
Not too hard to track you down, Bobby.

08:43.605 --> 08:46.064
Drinking Tequilla in your driveway.

08:46.508 --> 08:48.037
Got no reason to hide.

08:48.037 --> 08:50.660
We think you do.

08:51.598 --> 08:53.150
Know this man?

08:57.025 --> 08:58.254
Nope.

08:58.254 --> 09:01.871
He was killed today
in 660 Ruthland Ave.

09:01.871 --> 09:06.279
So? / So, we found your print
on the window used as an escape.

09:10.842 --> 09:13.149
I was there looking for a friend.

09:13.149 --> 09:14.877
The door slammed behind me.

09:14.877 --> 09:16.567
Got locked in.

09:17.382 --> 09:18.592
Okay.

09:18.592 --> 09:22.065
Well, got your prints,
Bobby, and they are fresh.

09:22.065 --> 09:27.074
Unless you got a witness,
you got nothing. Anything else?

09:27.074 --> 09:29.447
Yeah.

09:30.735 --> 09:33.500
Put your hand out like
you're holding a gun.

09:33.611 --> 09:35.011
Is this a joke?

09:35.011 --> 09:36.218
Do it.

09:51.573 --> 09:53.412
Revelations on Mike Griffith, Alex?

09:53.412 --> 09:58.578
Yeah, human body wasn't
made to withstand bullets.

09:58.578 --> 10:01.672
Here is his tox report. / Ok.

10:06.304 --> 10:07.874
These his effects?

10:07.874 --> 10:10.127
The tin of mints? It's empty.

10:10.184 --> 10:11.655
Nothing.

10:12.802 --> 10:15.293
You know Alex?
There is nothing,

10:16.206 --> 10:18.599
and then there's nothing.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.692
I'm gonna get the trace.

11:03.235 --> 11:04.240
Speed.

11:04.240 --> 11:06.238
These mints were curiously strong.

11:06.238 --> 11:10.614
However same chemical make up
as the residue from the bag at the scene.

11:10.696 --> 11:13.035
opioid analgesic.

11:13.035 --> 11:16.157
Painkillers.
What about a brand name?

11:16.157 --> 11:18.924
Oxy cone, Hill Billy Heroines?

11:18.924 --> 11:20.804
Griffith is probably addicted to this stuff

11:20.804 --> 11:23.903
No, he couldn't have been.
He's got a negative tox screen.

11:24.016 --> 11:26.125
Didn't Mike work for Coucilman Putnam?

11:26.125 --> 11:28.197
Then we just got a candidate.

11:34.849 --> 11:36.387
Good of you to...

11:36.795 --> 11:38.295
Good of you to see me Councilman.

11:38.295 --> 11:41.218
Excuse me for not getting up.
I'm nursing a back injury.

11:41.218 --> 11:42.987
You taking something for that?

11:42.987 --> 11:45.018
Steam rooms, hot shower.

11:48.231 --> 11:50.192
I assume you're here about Mike Griffith.

11:50.192 --> 11:52.250
Such a shame.
He was an exceptional young man.

11:52.250 --> 11:54.566
Yes, that's what I understand.

11:54.566 --> 11:56.967
I truly believed that he would
be sitting behind this desk one day.

11:56.967 --> 12:01.597
Yes, except for the fact that somebody
sent him into Golden Triangle to buy Oxy

12:01.597 --> 12:03.608
and he got killed for it.

12:04.800 --> 12:07.465
Are you aware that I ran on
a platform of zero-tolerance?

12:07.465 --> 12:11.361
I am, and I'm also aware of
your three months prescription last year,

12:11.361 --> 12:12.935
but the same drug.

12:12.935 --> 12:14.841
The State keeps records, Councilman.

12:14.841 --> 12:17.122
Water skiing accident.
The prescription ran out.

12:17.122 --> 12:20.391
My doctor told me about refills.

12:20.513 --> 12:23.035
Shot of Brandy does the trick for me now.

12:23.035 --> 12:24.521
I don't do drugs. (?)

12:24.521 --> 12:28.106
Are you familiar with
the journalist, named Josh Dalton?

12:28.106 --> 12:33.822
Of course. I read the paper. / He was with
Mike when Mike got killed buying your Oxy.

12:36.325 --> 12:40.000
So, how long did that go on?

12:41.453 --> 12:43.054
Couple of months.

12:43.117 --> 12:45.080
You know the dealer's name?

12:45.923 --> 12:49.333
Robby, Bobby something?
I never saw him.

12:49.333 --> 12:50.862
I can't understand why
he would do this to Mike.

12:50.862 --> 12:53.161
Did you ever send Mike in short?

12:53.229 --> 12:54.177
I'm not a man who likes debt.

12:54.177 --> 12:56.952
Okay, So he didn't get
wacked dealing with your tab.

12:56.952 --> 12:58.569
Let me restate this.

12:58.569 --> 13:01.097
I always send Mike
to the Triangle with cash

13:01.097 --> 13:04.744
Maybe, you can mention that as eulogy.

13:06.793 --> 13:08.769
You wouldn't be outing for tax evasion.

13:08.769 --> 13:13.064
No, you would merely be collaborating
information I've gathered in background.

13:13.299 --> 13:16.116
It's like confirming the sun shining.

13:16.116 --> 13:17.784
We already know it.

13:22.582 --> 13:25.622
Sir, I got a lieutenant from
Miami Dade PD on the other line.

13:25.622 --> 13:27.275
May I call you right back?

13:27.331 --> 13:29.078
Josh,

13:29.078 --> 13:33.064
why didn't you tell me that the
Councilman was addicted to Oxy?

13:34.227 --> 13:37.081
- Is this on the record?
- Whatever you like.

13:38.601 --> 13:40.677
Mike was his press guy.

13:40.677 --> 13:45.684
He said he give me access to Oxy culture
if I kept his boss's name out of the paper.

13:45.684 --> 13:47.639
So I couldn't tell you.

13:48.106 --> 13:50.363
Jim Leonard, Editor.

13:50.363 --> 13:53.243
- Is there a problem here?
- Josh, Jim,

13:53.243 --> 13:57.722
is obstructing a murder investigation, and
I need his note from his Golden Triangle story.

13:57.722 --> 13:59.513
Murder of Mike Griffith, you mean?

13:59.513 --> 14:03.003
Jim, Mike gave me names
and sources in strict confidence.

14:03.003 --> 14:05.658
Once of those
sources might be his killer.

14:05.760 --> 14:08.512
I am willing to go to jail
to protect my first amendment rights,

14:08.512 --> 14:11.081
and I would hope
that paper would back me.

14:11.081 --> 14:12.930
The fact is paper does,

14:12.930 --> 14:14.928
we don't give up sources.
I'm sorry lieutenant.

14:14.928 --> 14:17.762
No apology is necessary Jim,
but here's the bad news, gentlemen.

14:17.762 --> 14:19.832
I have a warrant for the notes.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.025
Jim?

14:22.831 --> 14:25.076
Judge Trump's a journalist.

14:32.060 --> 14:33.838
For the record, lieutenant,

14:33.838 --> 14:36.441
this is the last thing
Mike would've wanted.

14:37.815 --> 14:39.335
Not if we find his killer.

14:53.062 --> 14:55.137
I've been working
on your journalist's notes,

14:55.137 --> 15:01.878
and they're not penman shorthand
or Gregg's but not entirely.

15:01.985 --> 15:04.474
Got a little of both maybe.

15:04.474 --> 15:07.030
But take a look at this.

15:08.638 --> 15:10.001
Internet lingo.

15:10.862 --> 15:12.836
Means later.

15:12.973 --> 15:17.523
So it appears that Dalton created
his own language. Can you read it?

15:17.523 --> 15:20.616
Okay.

15:20.776 --> 15:25.839
It's an interview with
an operative of Las Sambras.

15:25.839 --> 15:29.057
- That Pro-Castro group?
- His shadows.

15:29.057 --> 15:30.600
I thought that was a myth.

15:30.600 --> 15:34.510
A way for politicians to explain
all the violence they can't control in Miami.

15:34.510 --> 15:35.948
The Golden Triangle.

15:35.948 --> 15:39.876
Something is weird
with this shorthand, though.

15:42.733 --> 15:44.551
Wait a second.

15:44.697 --> 15:47.470
Ok, I think I know what's going on here.

15:47.470 --> 15:48.599
It's reversed.

15:48.599 --> 15:49.927
What do you mean?

15:50.221 --> 15:53.224
The words are arranged
from right to left.

15:53.224 --> 15:55.252
Your reporter is a lefty.

15:59.796 --> 16:01.675
No he's not. He's right handed.

16:01.675 --> 16:03.597
Then these aren't his notes.

16:10.873 --> 16:14.232
Tyler, I need articles on Las Sambras.

16:14.343 --> 16:15.341
Okay.

16:15.341 --> 16:18.988
Sambras, landed revolutionaries,

16:18.988 --> 16:21.245
and secret.

16:21.245 --> 16:23.628
Keywords should get something.

16:25.299 --> 16:28.316
Here we go.
7 articles on Las Sambras.

16:28.316 --> 16:31.180
How they terrorize Miami area.

16:31.180 --> 16:32.650
Mostly Cuban Americans.

16:32.650 --> 16:35.333
Okay, who wrote these?

16:37.355 --> 16:38.858
Amy James. Miami Sun.

16:38.858 --> 16:40.436
Amy James. Is she a contributor?

16:40.436 --> 16:42.533
Senior writer. City desk.

16:42.533 --> 16:44.138
City desk.

16:44.138 --> 16:47.415
Right next to Josh's cubicle. Thank you.

16:48.125 --> 16:49.452
Yo, Speedle, I don't get it.

16:49.452 --> 16:52.581
Guy Jeter didn't have
any GSR in his hands,

16:52.581 --> 16:55.901
but I know he went out
that window for some reason.

16:55.901 --> 16:58.598
He probably washed it off with tequila,

16:58.698 --> 17:00.347
or he wore gloves.

17:00.347 --> 17:02.695
Did you find any gloves at that place?

17:02.799 --> 17:06.441
Nah, just a plastic
bag with traces of Oxy.

17:08.400 --> 17:10.957
I guess this could be used as a glove.

17:21.560 --> 17:23.611
Now look at that.

17:24.690 --> 17:26.785
Gun shot residue.

18:12.796 --> 18:14.320
What do we got?

18:14.572 --> 18:15.675
A twofer.

18:15.675 --> 18:19.457
A GSR on the outside and
the fingerprints on the inside.

18:31.456 --> 18:33.314
Bobby,

18:33.314 --> 18:35.932
you remember when
we said we were gonna need witness?

18:35.932 --> 18:37.846
We got one.

18:37.903 --> 18:40.021
Your fingerprints.

18:43.036 --> 18:47.191
You used that plastic bag as a glove,
and you shot Mike Griffith.

18:48.899 --> 18:50.524
I've been on a jag,

18:50.524 --> 18:52.808
speed, coke.

18:52.808 --> 18:55.166
Makes me extra paranoid.
I looked through that peephole,

18:55.166 --> 18:58.808
saw two guys with suits
on and I thought it was a bust.

19:02.462 --> 19:04.349
You didn't recognize Mike?

19:04.349 --> 19:06.971
Yeah, but the other
guy looked like a fed.

19:06.971 --> 19:08.754
He was a reporter.

19:08.899 --> 19:10.943
I guess I'm not so paranoid after all.

19:10.943 --> 19:13.435
No, if I were you,
I would return to paranoia, my friend.

19:13.435 --> 19:16.009
You're about to be charged with murder.

19:16.098 --> 19:20.059
I gotta ask. How did I miss
the other guy? The reporter?

19:20.131 --> 19:23.045
You missed the other guy

19:23.188 --> 19:25.871
because he's good at deceiving people.

19:32.700 --> 19:33.854
Josh.

19:33.854 --> 19:36.626
Hey! How could you
let the Ledger scoop me?

19:36.703 --> 19:40.342
Their in-office email says
you caught Mike's killer.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.283
I hacked in.

19:42.283 --> 19:44.595
It's Amy's desk over there, isn't it?

19:45.533 --> 19:46.890
Yeah.

19:46.992 --> 19:49.546
Does she know that
you stole her story, Josh?

19:49.546 --> 19:51.304
The story on Las Sambras?

19:51.304 --> 19:52.852
Amy and I share notes.

19:52.852 --> 19:54.425
Does she know you're sharing notes?

19:54.425 --> 19:57.211
Look, we work together all the time.

19:57.211 --> 19:58.996
She's senior to me. / Okay.

19:58.996 --> 20:01.721
- I'd like to talk to Amy.
- Well, so would I.

20:01.721 --> 20:03.924
I tried to call her all morning.

20:04.018 --> 20:06.322
Off the record?
Probably Too much merlot.

20:06.322 --> 20:07.828
Try her again.

20:08.378 --> 20:10.631
Now? / Right now.

20:10.631 --> 20:13.067
Is there a problem? / No.

20:16.008 --> 20:18.406
She has three numbers. We all do.

20:18.406 --> 20:21.554
The paper, sources, and personal.

20:30.511 --> 20:31.798
Josh!

20:31.798 --> 20:33.776
Amy?

20:33.776 --> 20:36.850
- Is that you?
- Amy, are you ok?

20:36.850 --> 20:39.028
Please! / Amy,

20:39.028 --> 20:41.430
try to stay on the line, Amy.

20:41.430 --> 20:43.847
Tyler, listen.
I'm gonna need to track a number.

20:43.847 --> 20:47.001
Use the GPS.
Hang on a second

20:47.001 --> 20:49.135
555-0156

20:49.135 --> 20:52.493
You can get that?
I will be in the car. You stay put.

20:58.405 --> 20:59.360
Where is she?

20:59.360 --> 21:01.263
Traveling west on Flagler.

21:01.263 --> 21:03.059
Cross street! /11th.

21:03.059 --> 21:05.712
Wait. She's turning on the 12th.

21:05.829 --> 21:06.750
Right or left?

21:06.750 --> 21:08.519
Left. / Okay, hang on.

21:08.519 --> 21:10.786
I see her. I got it. Thank you.

21:15.709 --> 21:17.758
Get out of the vehicle!
Get your hands in the air right now!

21:17.758 --> 21:19.806
Get out of the car.
Let me see your hands.

21:19.806 --> 21:21.342
- Let me see your hands.
- Let me see it. let's go.

21:21.342 --> 21:23.988
Move around the car!
Let's go. Let's go.

21:23.988 --> 21:26.708
Open the trunk!
Open the trunk!

21:26.708 --> 21:28.815
- I don't know how.
- Where's the key?

21:29.227 --> 21:32.326
- I said open the trunk!
- This ain't our car! This ain't our car!

21:32.326 --> 21:34.173
- What are you saying?
- We stole it.

21:34.173 --> 21:35.867
You stole a car?

21:36.200 --> 21:38.414
- Okay, get down on your knees.
- There is no trunk release in this car.

21:38.414 --> 21:41.793
- You need a key to open it up.
- Eric, get that trunk open.

21:42.025 --> 21:44.023
Where'd you steal the car, friend?

21:45.035 --> 21:46.891
- Where?
- Enportade and the 7th Street.

21:46.891 --> 21:49.551
Okay. / Enportade and
7th Street. That's Amy's place!

21:49.747 --> 21:52.666
Hey, what about this blood?
Do you notice that?

21:52.666 --> 21:54.900
- You sure?
- I swear to God, I sweat to God.

21:54.900 --> 21:56.568
Okay,

22:14.085 --> 22:16.284
I'm sorry Amy.

22:16.284 --> 22:18.674
I'm sorry.

22:21.560 --> 22:23.449
Take'm in.

22:27.742 --> 22:29.438
I'm sorry, Amy.

22:39.718 --> 22:41.656
Miss James was shot three times.

22:41.656 --> 22:46.722
Once to the back of the head,
two to the back. Organs bled out slowly.

22:47.153 --> 22:49.227
The bullet didn't pierce the brain.

22:49.227 --> 22:52.340
Entered her scalp, followed her hairline,

22:52.340 --> 22:55.569
then lodged near her ear.

22:58.338 --> 23:00.807
So is was the body hit
that did the damage.

23:00.807 --> 23:04.504
Yeah. She bled out on the inside.

23:04.504 --> 23:06.921
Took hours to expire.

23:07.067 --> 23:10.329
Explains why she was
able to take a call in the trunk.

23:11.380 --> 23:12.646
What do you mean?

23:12.646 --> 23:14.043
What do I mean?

23:14.043 --> 23:17.133
You went as white as a ghost when
you heard Amy's voice on the speakerphone.

23:17.133 --> 23:20.974
That's what I mean. And that's
because she was supposed to dead already.

23:23.442 --> 23:25.128
Josh.

23:25.273 --> 23:27.901
- I don't even own a gun.
- This was never about Mike.

23:27.901 --> 23:32.371
The reality is that you shot
Amy hours before Mike was killed.

23:32.371 --> 23:34.224
You don't have all your facts.

23:34.224 --> 23:37.629
If I thought you did,
you would've arrested me by now.

23:37.629 --> 23:41.285
- Is that a fair statement?
- Are you talking ethics to me, Josh?

23:41.285 --> 23:45.128
Look, I was UPI's youngest
reporter ever to fly Air Force One.

23:45.128 --> 23:48.230
And I had broken major
stories for the Miami Suns.

23:48.230 --> 23:51.395
Gunrunnimg, dorm porn, you name it.

23:51.395 --> 23:53.717
At what cost?

23:55.477 --> 23:57.673
That's Amy's parking space.

23:57.673 --> 24:00.062
Looks like there's blood on this column.

24:00.519 --> 24:03.702
So our vic took one shot
even before she got to her car.

24:08.827 --> 24:10.802
Second shot was
through and through, right?

24:10.802 --> 24:12.602
Third shot was to the head.

24:17.259 --> 24:19.425
Why do you have
that look on your face?

24:19.567 --> 24:23.184
The splatter's only on the
lower half of the BMW's window.

24:23.184 --> 24:25.873
So either the shooter was really tall

24:25.873 --> 24:29.879
Or shot at a high angle
like from a SUV or a truck.

24:31.308 --> 24:34.046
The clearance for this garage is 7 feet.

24:40.006 --> 24:41.323
It says Ekka.

24:41.637 --> 24:44.133
That's a brand for running light.

24:49.088 --> 24:51.589
Lucky for us, the garage got it.

24:53.398 --> 24:55.255
Well, this is blood.

24:55.345 --> 24:57.526
Are you gonna process Amy's next?

24:58.475 --> 25:00.313
Horatio's up there now.

25:03.468 --> 25:04.624
Look at these.

25:04.624 --> 25:07.338
These are all bomb site
history from Las Sambras.

25:07.338 --> 25:09.664
Yeah, they target law
abiding Cuban-Americans

25:09.664 --> 25:12.927
who have guts to speak against Castro.

25:13.058 --> 25:16.633
Read all these articles,
but I didn't read Amy's by-line till now.

25:16.719 --> 25:20.466
No doubt Las Sambras
has this place been searched.

25:20.466 --> 25:23.482
- And it's hot in here, too.
- Yeah, and here's why.

25:23.482 --> 25:24.685
Look at this.

25:24.685 --> 25:27.556
Take ripped thermostat off the wall.

25:32.167 --> 25:34.027
And the smoke detector.

25:35.696 --> 25:37.201
Battery's missing.

25:37.340 --> 25:40.246
Yeah, I'm not surprised.

25:40.359 --> 25:41.865
Ok, here's what we need to do.

25:41.865 --> 25:45.328
Let's look in the bedroom
to see if the alarm clock is missing.

25:54.823 --> 25:56.470
It's definitely not ticking.

25:56.540 --> 25:58.757
Battery is the power source.

25:58.757 --> 26:01.097
Thermostat is the action switch.

26:01.097 --> 26:04.863
And the clock is the timer
ingredients for a homemade bomb.

26:04.863 --> 26:07.179
Las Sambras,

26:07.179 --> 26:09.490
they used Amy's thing
to make their next bomb.

26:09.490 --> 26:11.698
Maybe warning her to shut up.

26:17.956 --> 26:20.664
Some kind of mark on her hand.

26:20.767 --> 26:23.338
She was in rigor,
that's why I didn't see it

26:23.338 --> 26:25.188
That looks like ink.

26:25.511 --> 26:28.422
- I'm gonna get that QDed.
- No can't do, Horatio.

26:28.422 --> 26:31.491
Body stays intact,
the QD is going to have to find me.

26:31.491 --> 26:34.268
No problem.

26:36.555 --> 26:37.783
Anything?

26:37.783 --> 26:39.845
Nothing I can read.

26:42.021 --> 26:43.767
You know what?
Let's use the night scope.

26:43.767 --> 26:45.783
Maybe we can enhance the writing.

26:45.851 --> 26:47.967
Read my mind. / Good.

26:49.281 --> 26:52.092
I was just hoping that photons
created enough light in the image

26:52.092 --> 26:55.571
intensifier tube to define the image.

27:02.057 --> 27:04.106
Still blurry. / All right.
Here's what we do.

27:04.106 --> 27:08.809
Let's leave the lens open, the longer the exposure,
the greater chance we have some light in the image.

27:08.809 --> 27:13.242
And the blank space surrounding the
print line will burn the image onto the film.

27:13.242 --> 27:14.566
That's exactly right.

27:14.566 --> 27:17.597
- How long should I give it?
- As long as it takes.

27:26.172 --> 27:28.180
- What did we get?
- It worked.

27:28.327 --> 27:30.408
What is it, a license plate?

27:31.552 --> 27:33.192
No, it's..

27:33.192 --> 27:35.324
- This is an address.
- How do you know?

27:35.324 --> 27:36.431
You see the CO?

27:36.431 --> 27:38.559
That's Calle Ocho. Little Havana.

27:38.559 --> 27:40.483
What about the 11122?

27:40.483 --> 27:42.885
That is the location of the bomb.

28:12.283 --> 28:15.185
Sir!

28:16.157 --> 28:19.163
Step away from the table right now.

28:27.398 --> 28:29.136
Put your hands behind your back.

28:32.612 --> 28:35.597
These are the missing
components from Amy's apartment.

28:35.597 --> 28:37.652
Could've come from anywhere.

28:37.761 --> 28:39.594
Yes, they could've,

28:39.594 --> 28:43.005
but this, this couldn't have.

28:57.865 --> 28:59.721
That's a perfect fit.

28:59.846 --> 29:03.818
And that means that you
were in Amy's apartment, weren't you?

29:04.063 --> 29:05.755
Amy,

29:05.755 --> 29:08.146
the one writes those
lies about Las Sambras.

29:08.146 --> 29:11.883
Yeah, and I supposed the bombings in
Little Havana didn't take place either, right?

29:11.883 --> 29:14.293
Your forefathers were revolutionaries.

29:14.293 --> 29:18.282
We're no different. / What I'm interested
in is whether you were there by yourself

29:18.282 --> 29:20.664
or you were with your
brethren and which one?

29:20.664 --> 29:24.995
- Don't I get a lawyer?
- After you tell me who you are with.

29:25.590 --> 29:28.134
Las Sambras don't even exist.

29:50.946 --> 29:52.100
Luis wants to make a deal.

29:52.100 --> 29:54.963
That is breaking into Amy's apartment
and manufacturing a bomb.

29:54.963 --> 29:56.307
And what do we get out of it?

29:56.307 --> 29:59.105
Address of the next place
Las Sambras are going to bomb.

29:59.105 --> 30:03.807
- And names of two of his partners.
- From a revolutionary to a rat in record time.

30:03.807 --> 30:05.689
- But there's a glitch.
- What is that?

30:05.689 --> 30:08.389
- He won't coop to his murder.
- I don't need him to.

30:08.389 --> 30:10.726
What do you think it's
still the reporter? / I do.

30:10.726 --> 30:12.966
All right. You got any
evidence to support that?

30:12.966 --> 30:15.343
On the way.

30:32.373 --> 30:33.834
You've got any messages?

30:33.834 --> 30:36.205
No, nothing.

30:36.353 --> 30:37.707
But...

30:37.707 --> 30:40.758
it's an old-school answering machine,the kind with the tape.

30:40.758 --> 30:44.485
So, a little effort, we mightbe able to get something.

30:44.485 --> 30:47.248
So what are you doing?
Just ignore the obvious stuff now?

30:47.248 --> 30:48.529
What we've got?

30:48.529 --> 30:50.536
There always a cigar here.

30:50.536 --> 30:52.204
I mean she had a visitor,

30:52.204 --> 30:55.068
it's been chewed
It probably got DNA on it.

30:55.068 --> 30:56.605
Could be the killer.

30:56.792 --> 31:00.672
The journals. / I've de-enncrypted
Josh's and Amy's notebooks.

31:00.672 --> 31:03.463
And I found what seems to
be notes from her new story.

31:03.463 --> 31:04.850
New story, About what?

31:04.850 --> 31:07.335
Can't quite tell, she writes
in nicknames and codes

31:07.335 --> 31:11.450
- But I'll give you what I have.
- Okay, sounds like a plan.

31:12.789 --> 31:14.985
Hey / Hey, what's up?

31:15.261 --> 31:18.122
Valera's processing the cigar.

31:18.122 --> 31:20.149
Yeah. / Where's Tyler?

31:20.269 --> 31:21.811
I don't know.

31:21.811 --> 31:23.694
It's alright, I can handle this.

31:24.767 --> 31:26.240
Okay.

31:27.869 --> 31:29.225
You think we're
gonna get anything?

31:29.225 --> 31:32.461
Most answering machines
aren't perfectly aligned.

31:32.570 --> 31:35.555
The audio is written either too high
or too low on the tape stream.

31:35.555 --> 31:39.617
Right, so when the eraser head wipes the tape,
it could miss some of the audio.

31:39.617 --> 31:41.087
Exactly.

31:50.826 --> 31:52.646
Amy, I didn't mean
to fly off the handle

31:52.646 --> 31:55.402
but you're gonna hurt
a lot of people if you write that story.

31:55.402 --> 32:00.524
Call me, 555-0140
Extension 27.

32:00.524 --> 32:04.433
555-0140?

32:04.433 --> 32:05.966
The newspaper.

32:06.053 --> 32:07.755
And whose extension is that?

32:07.844 --> 32:09.175
I called Amy.

32:09.175 --> 32:12.046
I'm her editor. There's
nothing suspicious about that.

32:12.144 --> 32:14.597
It's funny that you
didn't mention homicide,

32:14.597 --> 32:18.216
that recently flew
off the handle with Amy.

32:18.216 --> 32:20.332
Matter of fact, I have
the transcript here.

32:21.015 --> 32:24.061
Transcript evinces a pejorative.

32:25.968 --> 32:28.075
That's some vocabulary, sir.

32:28.679 --> 32:30.122
I like you, too.

32:30.450 --> 32:32.958
Bring an attitude to your craft.

32:33.800 --> 32:37.818
It's not a craft, it's murder investigation
And you had a fight with Amy.

32:37.904 --> 32:40.269
You wanna come down
to homicide and talk about it?

32:40.269 --> 32:41.969
No, I don't.

32:42.064 --> 32:43.717
You don't?

32:44.391 --> 32:47.453
Were you at Amy's the
night she choose to go?

32:47.453 --> 32:48.852
No.

32:48.970 --> 32:51.355
No? / Nope.

32:51.469 --> 32:53.981
She worked for me
I've never been to her place.

32:56.557 --> 32:58.589
That was found at Amy's.

32:58.589 --> 33:00.746
Now the DNA on that is male.

33:00.746 --> 33:05.286
We're looking for matches pretty
interesting that you smoke the same brand.

33:12.223 --> 33:14.011
I'd like to call my lawyer.

33:14.105 --> 33:15.945
You should probably do that.

33:31.973 --> 33:34.063
I heard there's been a developement.

33:34.063 --> 33:38.738
Well, QD notes that Amy began
gathering information on new story, but

33:38.738 --> 33:41.366
none of the codes make any sense

33:41.546 --> 33:46.673
It says here I went to Luceabout
Captain Burtler concerning "Ghost Ship"

33:48.906 --> 33:50.377
Ghost Ships.

33:50.377 --> 33:52.900
You mean like mirage possibly?

33:53.079 --> 33:54.657
I don't know.

33:54.657 --> 33:55.932
That's weird.

33:55.932 --> 33:58.117
I did whole story
a couple of years ago,

33:58.117 --> 33:58.941
gunrunner.

33:58.941 --> 34:03.860
Yeah, how they used crew
ships to transfer major weapons.

34:04.023 --> 34:06.951
Okay, we need everything
that Miami Sun put out last year

34:06.951 --> 34:11.801
about gunrunners
masquerading as crew ships, Right?

34:17.181 --> 34:18.739
Jim Rennart?

34:18.739 --> 34:20.516
Editor in chief.

34:20.601 --> 34:22.496
I didn't kill Amy.

34:24.478 --> 34:27.409
Well, that didn't take you long, Jim.

34:28.831 --> 34:31.377
I went to her place,
we had words.

34:31.377 --> 34:32.664
That's all.

34:32.664 --> 34:38.248
I understand that Josh's article about
the Miami gunrunners using cruise ships

34:38.248 --> 34:41.257
boosted your circulation by 20, 000

34:44.408 --> 34:46.867
The story all elevated our
journalistic profile.

34:46.867 --> 34:50.512
Ghost Ships don't exist, right?

34:50.512 --> 34:54.741
That's very, very
difficult to verify sources

34:54.741 --> 34:56.512
Gunrunners are outlaws.

34:56.512 --> 34:58.489
Cruise ships stonewall.
Squeaky clean image.

34:58.489 --> 35:00.971
In other words,
Josh made whole thing up.

35:01.513 --> 35:05.571
- I did suspect that..
- And Amy was onto him, right?

35:06.663 --> 35:08.830
She told me her suspicions.

35:09.076 --> 35:11.050
I begged her to let it go.

35:11.277 --> 35:13.224
He's good for the paper circulation.

35:13.224 --> 35:15.044
He's a liar, Jim

35:15.044 --> 35:16.974
So your writing will offset that.

35:16.974 --> 35:18.376
He brings readers to you

35:18.376 --> 35:21.245
You mean he gets you promotions

35:24.224 --> 35:26.519
Well, I guess she didn't, did she?

35:29.892 --> 35:31.685
kid is a star.

35:31.685 --> 35:34.622
I,I moved up two slots since he
started working at the paper,

35:34.622 --> 35:37.234
and the offers are just pouring in.
From New York.

35:37.234 --> 35:39.998
Big papers, magzines,
I'm in a whole new stratosphere.

35:39.998 --> 35:41.358
All with Amy out of the way.

35:41.358 --> 35:42.764
No, no, no,

35:42.764 --> 35:43.986
I didn't kill her, I didn't.

35:43.986 --> 35:47.739
Jim, you need to give
me something right now.

35:51.526 --> 35:54.893
When Dalton was covering,

35:54.893 --> 35:57.415
creating gunrunner story.

35:57.518 --> 35:58.998
He went to shooting range.

35:58.998 --> 36:01.283
The owner gave me
free run of the place.

36:01.283 --> 36:02.898
Got called me next day,

36:02.898 --> 36:06.402
said one of his guns was missing,
he suspected Josh'd stolen it,

36:06.402 --> 36:09.254
- But he never had any proof.
- What kind of gun is it?

36:09.943 --> 36:12.174
.22 caliber Kemper.

36:12.174 --> 36:15.553
Okay, did Josh ever
discuss killing Amy with you?

36:15.553 --> 36:19.163
- No, of course not.
- But you suspected, didn't you?

36:19.238 --> 36:20.956
Right?

36:21.171 --> 36:23.777
And just like Josh's stories.

36:23.777 --> 36:27.050
you aren't interested
in the truth, were you?

36:29.227 --> 36:33.417
the Kemper.22, chrome six shot.
A two-inch barrel.

36:33.417 --> 36:34.605
It was first on my list

36:34.605 --> 36:37.341
So the bullets in Amy definitely
could have come from the kemper.

36:37.341 --> 36:39.781
Okay, here's what we do
we get a warrant for Josh's home,

36:39.781 --> 36:41.956
office, and car, Right now.

36:41.956 --> 36:43.318
Okay.

36:44.508 --> 36:48.531
We have searched his entire condo,
his office, and his jim locker.

36:48.531 --> 36:49.822
And there's no gun.

36:49.822 --> 36:51.597
Yeah, same deal here.

36:51.597 --> 36:55.167
But we know from the running lights that
this is the vehicle from the scene, right?

36:58.864 --> 37:00.581
I don't know,
maybe he tossed the gun.

37:00.581 --> 37:02.606
No I'm positive it's here.

37:02.606 --> 37:03.468
Why?

37:03.468 --> 37:05.796
Because Josh swears that it isn't.

37:07.562 --> 37:08.844
Alright.

37:10.831 --> 37:12.255
You know something?

37:12.255 --> 37:15.793
I wanna put the spare tires back
Why don't you siphon the gas, I've got an idea.

37:15.793 --> 37:17.559
Okay.

37:22.711 --> 37:24.295
Go ahead.

37:24.295 --> 37:25.922
Now got a little room.

37:26.589 --> 37:28.676
Little bit, easy.

37:30.283 --> 37:31.622
Thanks guys. / No problem

37:39.833 --> 37:44.362
Get 4,760, What do the specs say?

37:44.941 --> 37:48.276
The specs say 4,747.

37:48.276 --> 37:50.944
- 13 pounds over.
- Kemper's only a couple of pounds.

37:50.944 --> 37:53.900
What do you think
causing the extra weight?

37:54.018 --> 37:55.937
Is the gas removed? / Yeah.

37:55.937 --> 37:58.240
All of it? / Yeah.

37:58.240 --> 38:01.498
- About 9 or 10 gallons?
- Give or take.

38:01.595 --> 38:04.198
Gas tank said there was almost full.

38:04.512 --> 38:07.833
There's no way a truck of
that size has a gas tank that small.

38:07.833 --> 38:11.001
You know what?
I should have thought this sooner.

38:18.814 --> 38:21.472
Modified metal box.

38:22.227 --> 38:24.590
People put in the smaller gas tank.

38:24.590 --> 38:26.664
The extra space.

38:26.881 --> 38:30.405
Put in electronics, wiring...

38:31.123 --> 38:32.665
Or...

38:35.249 --> 38:38.817
Here's a little.22 caliber Kemper.

38:42.822 --> 38:45.775
You found a gun, In my car.

38:45.775 --> 38:46.872
Yeah.

38:46.872 --> 38:49.143
I found this gun, Josh.

38:49.509 --> 38:52.628
This is the gun which
you killed Amy James with.

38:52.730 --> 38:55.609
Ah, it's, it's just not possible.

38:55.609 --> 38:59.361
I mean, I, I must be
getting set up here...

39:00.708 --> 39:02.041
No, I mean..

39:02.041 --> 39:04.028
Jim Rennart, our editor

39:04.028 --> 39:06.669
I think that I, you know,
he and Amy had an affair and...

39:06.669 --> 39:08.280
Josh.

39:09.925 --> 39:11.543
It's over.

39:11.716 --> 39:14.537
But lieutenant,
why would I wanna kill Amy?

39:14.537 --> 39:16.848
Because Amy knew
your story was fraud

39:16.848 --> 39:19.874
and she was going to
Rennart to expose you that's why.

39:22.049 --> 39:26.585
These are from Amy's notebook.
And should seem familiar to you.

39:26.655 --> 39:29.397
Because you looked
in her note, didn't you?

39:39.737 --> 39:44.073
Captain Burtler, gunrunner
from Gone with the wind,

39:44.126 --> 39:47.478
J.R., your editor
And Luce is Henry R. Luce,

39:47.478 --> 39:50.366
the most prolific publisher
of the 20th century.

39:50.366 --> 39:52.242
You killed Amy.

39:52.242 --> 39:53.536
Josh.

39:53.536 --> 39:55.942
Not to steal the story,

39:56.761 --> 39:59.601
but to prevent one from happening.

40:18.286 --> 40:19.367
No.

40:19.367 --> 40:21.195
Josh.

40:22.261 --> 40:24.037
Sit down.

40:27.103 --> 40:30.350
You know, Josh
The truth...

40:30.350 --> 40:32.038
has this funny,

40:32.038 --> 40:34.841
mysterious way...

40:34.841 --> 40:37.168
of finding daylight.

40:40.824 --> 40:42.554
Book him.
