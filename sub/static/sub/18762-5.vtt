00:35.825 --> 00:37.026
<i>All right.</i>

00:37.059 --> 00:38.593
Uh, let's get started.

00:39.047 --> 00:40.996
What do you guys want to know?

01:02.797 --> 01:05.072
<i>The circumstances
surrounding the death of</i>

01:05.105 --> 01:07.174
<i>the woman born Maureen Ponderosa</i>

01:07.208 --> 01:09.510
<i>captivated South Philadelphia.</i>

01:10.878 --> 01:13.682
<i>She was discovered in an
alley with a broken neck.</i>

01:16.851 --> 01:19.354
<i>In 2013, Maureen had begun</i>

01:19.387 --> 01:21.385
<i>her transition to a cat.</i>

01:21.388 --> 01:24.658
<i>And in her cat form,
she went by the name Bastet</i>

01:24.691 --> 01:27.194
<i>to honor the Egyptian god of cats.</i>

01:28.548 --> 01:32.352
<i>The story quickly became
fodder for local media.</i>

01:32.385 --> 01:33.720
So much for having nine lives.

01:33.753 --> 01:35.522
This cat did not land on her feet.

01:35.556 --> 01:37.324
She landed on her neck.

01:37.357 --> 01:38.526
<i>Authorities soon focused</i>

01:38.539 --> 01:41.176
<i>on the suspicious nature of her death.</i>

01:42.610 --> 01:43.845
<i>My name is Lance Girard.</i>

01:44.218 --> 01:47.388
<i>I've been with the Philadelphia
Police Department for 24 years,</i>

01:47.421 --> 01:50.391
<i>12 of which were with
the Homicide division.</i>

01:50.424 --> 01:52.193
I've seen a lot of things.

01:52.225 --> 01:54.562
A man wants to turn
himself into a woman?

01:54.594 --> 01:57.130
Okay. Who am I to judge?

01:57.163 --> 02:00.000
But, really, a cat?

02:00.033 --> 02:02.335
What's next? A watermelon?

02:03.437 --> 02:05.239
<i>First thing we wanted to establish is</i>

02:05.271 --> 02:07.374
<i>to whether the deceased
was acting strange.</i>

02:07.407 --> 02:10.377
Not like "I'm turning myself
into a cat" strange.

02:10.411 --> 02:12.847
More like suicide strange.

02:12.879 --> 02:15.383
<i>We learned that she was excited
about an upcoming surgery,</i>

02:15.415 --> 02:18.385
<i>a, uh, reverse nipplectomy.</i>

02:18.419 --> 02:20.054
<i>That's where they add more nipples.</i>

02:21.288 --> 02:22.890
I guess...

02:22.923 --> 02:25.860
I don't know... she wanted more nipples.

02:25.892 --> 02:29.330
The thought of that just makes
me want to blow my lunch.

02:29.362 --> 02:31.998
<i>Now, apparently,
the ex-husband was on the hook</i>

02:32.032 --> 02:34.936
<i>for this surgery due to
an alimony arrangement.</i>

02:34.968 --> 02:37.204
He wasn't happy about it.

02:37.237 --> 02:39.539
That's when he became
our primary suspect.

02:40.669 --> 02:42.242
<i>Was I irritated by this?</i>

02:42.276 --> 02:43.677
Yeah, of course I was.

02:43.711 --> 02:46.114
I mean, it was
the most expensive procedure yet.

02:46.146 --> 02:48.281
You know, but I-I remained supportive

02:48.314 --> 02:50.418
and, uh, kept my cool.

02:50.450 --> 02:52.953
And I never threatened her in any way.

03:10.971 --> 03:13.106
Now, due to the nature of this call,

03:13.140 --> 03:15.409
we decided to bring
him in for questioning.

03:17.706 --> 03:18.712
<i>And he cooperated.</i>

03:18.746 --> 03:21.082
Said he wanted to clear his name.

03:32.626 --> 03:34.462
<i>He answered every question.</i>

03:34.495 --> 03:36.664
Even offered DNA samples.

03:36.697 --> 03:39.300
Although he did request
to draw his own blood,

03:39.332 --> 03:41.436
which is kind of strange.

03:59.520 --> 04:02.356
Mr. Reynolds was forthright.

04:02.388 --> 04:04.359
Charming, quite frankly.

04:08.128 --> 04:09.630
<i>It wasn't until I reviewed</i>

04:09.662 --> 04:12.866
<i>the interrogation footage
later that I saw it.</i>

04:13.730 --> 04:15.804
Something very unsettling.

04:20.339 --> 04:22.509
<i>24 years on the job,</i>

04:22.542 --> 04:24.545
<i>I'd never seen anything like it.</i>

04:26.580 --> 04:29.015
<i>Two hours.</i>

04:29.049 --> 04:31.017
<i>Never moved.</i>

04:31.051 --> 04:33.621
<i>Never blinked.</i>

04:33.654 --> 04:36.858
Gives me goose bumps
just thinking about it.

04:37.606 --> 04:39.492
<i>He had all the right answers,</i>

04:39.525 --> 04:42.028
<i>but my gut told me this guy was guilty.</i>

04:43.189 --> 04:44.598
Of something.

04:46.500 --> 04:48.836
Did I kill Maureen? No.

04:48.868 --> 04:52.440
Am I glad she's dead? Sure.

04:55.081 --> 04:58.392
<i>Maureen's family was
convinced of Dennis's guilt.</i>

04:59.320 --> 05:00.306
<i>Maureen?</i>

05:00.339 --> 05:02.475
Maureen died three years ago.

05:02.507 --> 05:04.476
Dennis killed Bastet, all right?

05:04.510 --> 05:07.512
And let me tell you something.
He did us all a favor.

05:07.546 --> 05:11.050
You ever seen a grown woman
take a dump in a sandbox?

05:11.556 --> 05:14.253
<i>Despite conjecture,
the question still remained:</i>

05:14.615 --> 05:17.056
<i>Was there anything
in Dennis Reynolds' past</i>

05:17.089 --> 05:19.740
<i>that would suggest
him capable of murder?</i>

05:19.968 --> 05:21.736
Testing. Testing.

05:21.770 --> 05:23.430
Syphilis. Syphilis.

05:25.630 --> 05:26.908
That's... Well, yeah...

05:26.941 --> 05:29.112
Well, he kind of...

05:29.145 --> 05:33.116
snapped the neck, uh,
off a crow one time a little bit.

05:33.148 --> 05:34.716
But that... but that's not

05:34.749 --> 05:36.751
not <i>normal right, you know?</i>

05:36.785 --> 05:38.754
<i>I mean, it was just like boys</i>

05:38.787 --> 05:40.957
being boys. Yeah. That...

05:40.989 --> 05:43.992
Look, we had a totally
normal childhood, and...

05:44.025 --> 05:45.761
<i>Look, Dennis wouldn't hurt a fly.
No way.</i>

05:45.794 --> 05:47.797
<i>Whatever Deandra says is BS.</i>

05:47.830 --> 05:49.398
She's probably just covering for him

05:49.431 --> 05:52.268
because she's afraid he's gonna
snap her neck like that crow.

05:52.909 --> 05:53.803
<i>He didn't just snap it.</i>

05:53.835 --> 05:55.437
<i>He broke the thing's head clean off.</i>

05:55.470 --> 05:56.544
<i>It was gruesome.</i>

05:57.006 --> 05:58.840
I still have nightmares about it.

05:58.874 --> 06:00.008
And I'm old.

06:00.042 --> 06:01.943
She told you what?

06:01.977 --> 06:03.479
No, no, no, no. No, no.

06:03.511 --> 06:06.114
Look... that crow was injured,

06:06.148 --> 06:08.484
and I was simply putting
it out of its misery,

06:08.516 --> 06:12.355
while, yes, testing the tensile
strength of a crow's neck.

06:13.689 --> 06:15.458
Well, yes, there was another crow,

06:15.491 --> 06:17.126
but that's because I
simply couldn't believe

06:17.158 --> 06:19.028
that a crow's neck could be that weak.

06:20.295 --> 06:21.997
Well, yes, there was a third crow,

06:22.030 --> 06:25.100
and a fourth, if you must know,
but who likes crows?

06:25.792 --> 06:27.802
<i>Look, if you can kill a crow,
you can kill a cat.</i>

06:27.835 --> 06:31.340
<i>Cat, cat, cat...</i>

06:31.372 --> 06:35.644
That's why I started recording
all our conversations.

07:23.546 --> 07:25.393
I suspected Frank was probably recording

07:25.427 --> 07:28.297
all of our conversations,
because of course he would.

07:28.329 --> 07:29.632
But let me tell you something,

07:29.665 --> 07:31.166
he was no fan of Maureen's, either.

07:31.199 --> 07:32.968
He was just trying to deflect attention,

07:33.000 --> 07:35.103
which is why I started recording

07:35.137 --> 07:37.773
all of our conversations as well.

07:37.805 --> 07:39.942
I could have worn a goddamn
IMAX camera around my neck

07:39.975 --> 07:41.343
and he wouldn't have noticed.

07:41.375 --> 07:43.144
The old bitch.

07:43.178 --> 07:45.346
And I caught him saying
some pretty troubling stuff.

07:45.380 --> 07:48.117
What are we watching here?

07:48.149 --> 07:49.484
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cats, cats.

07:49.517 --> 07:50.918
Is that me?

07:50.952 --> 07:52.821
Cats.
I'll tell you what to do with cats.

07:52.853 --> 07:54.522
Who shot this thing? Dennis?

07:54.555 --> 07:56.658
Here's what you do with cats.

07:56.692 --> 07:59.595
Back in the sweatshop in 'Nam,
we found a cat,

07:59.627 --> 08:01.363
we tossed it right in the soup.

08:01.396 --> 08:04.833
Those hungry bastards
ate cat soup every day.

08:04.865 --> 08:06.435
What's the worst thing
that could happen?

08:06.468 --> 08:09.438
Some little kid choke
on a hairball and die.

08:09.471 --> 08:11.340
So then you toss him in the soup.

08:11.372 --> 08:14.109
I was making money
hand over foot, literally.

08:14.141 --> 08:17.445
Somebody lost a hand or a foot,
I'd toss it in the soup.

08:19.081 --> 08:20.716
Well, that's all a lie.

08:21.982 --> 08:23.718
Uh, there was no soup.

08:26.321 --> 08:27.889
Nope.

08:27.923 --> 08:29.557
There's no sweatshop.

08:32.494 --> 08:35.597
Excuse me. I got to go to the can.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.766
<i>Investigators
wanted to verify the timeline</i>

09:42.799 --> 09:44.682
<i>Dennis provided to authorities.</i>

09:44.912 --> 09:46.503
<i>Like I told the police, uh,</i>

09:46.536 --> 09:48.472
Mac and I were watching a
movie back at the apartment,

09:48.504 --> 09:50.139
and then I went to the bar.

09:50.172 --> 09:52.676
That's true. We were watching
<i>Operation Dumbo Drop.</i>

09:52.709 --> 09:55.345
We were doing this amazing
thing that I came up with,

09:55.378 --> 09:56.913
where we watch an old movie,

09:56.946 --> 09:59.115
and then I turn the
volume down really low

09:59.148 --> 10:01.618
and we make wiseacre
remarks the entire time.

10:01.651 --> 10:03.087
Yeah, he didn't come up with it.

10:03.119 --> 10:04.455
It's just <i>Mystery Science Theater 3000.</i>

10:04.488 --> 10:06.656
- It's a spin on that.
- It's exactly that.

10:06.690 --> 10:08.624
- Well, there's no robots.
- So it's worse.

10:08.657 --> 10:10.326
Oh, come on, Dennis. It's funny.

10:10.359 --> 10:12.095
It-It's not funny.
It's not funny at all,

10:12.128 --> 10:13.964
because you can never
think of jokes on the fly.

10:13.997 --> 10:15.498
H-He, like, pauses the movie

10:15.531 --> 10:17.100
to try and think of
something funny to say,

10:17.133 --> 10:18.668
and then he never can
think of anything funny,

10:18.701 --> 10:22.305
so he ends up just saying a line
from <i>Borat</i> or <i>Austin Powers.</i>

10:22.339 --> 10:24.608
It's super annoying and played-out,
and it's not funny.

10:24.641 --> 10:27.176
Well, uh, like this. "Get in my belly."

10:27.209 --> 10:30.180
But you're never referring
to anything when you say it.

10:30.213 --> 10:32.182
"Yeah, baby. Get in my belly."

10:32.214 --> 10:33.649
Well, that's two different characters.

10:33.682 --> 10:35.718
- That's Mike Myers.
- It's not Mike Myers.

10:35.752 --> 10:37.654
It's... it's multiple characters

10:37.686 --> 10:40.356
that Mike Myers plays
in-in the same movie.

10:40.389 --> 10:42.125
Multiple characters in the same movie?

10:42.158 --> 10:44.227
What is he, a wizard?

10:44.261 --> 10:45.629
Look, it's funny, Dennis.

10:45.661 --> 10:47.131
It's not funny.

10:47.163 --> 10:48.965
Are we done with this? Can we be done?

10:48.998 --> 10:51.134
I'm tired of saying the same
things over and over again.

10:51.167 --> 10:53.169
Well, wait. Wh... hold...
Dennis, d-don't leave without me.

10:53.203 --> 10:55.506
I mean, dude, look, are you mad at me?

10:55.538 --> 10:57.740
<i>Investigators
could find no discrepancies</i>

10:57.773 --> 10:58.741
<i>in the timeline.</i>

10:58.775 --> 11:00.744
<i>But then...</i>

11:00.777 --> 11:02.812
<i>a twist.</i>

11:02.845 --> 11:04.580
He totally could have done it.

11:04.613 --> 11:08.051
Now, supposably,
Dennis didn't see Maureen that night,

11:08.084 --> 11:11.721
but remember that Maureen
was once Dennis's...

11:11.754 --> 11:15.558
"Wife. Very nice."

11:18.027 --> 11:19.329
That was Borat.

11:19.362 --> 11:23.700
<i>It was Friday, payday.</i>

11:23.733 --> 11:25.569
<i>Maureen always came into Paddy's</i>

11:25.602 --> 11:28.205
<i>to pick up her alimony check, ASAP.</i>

11:28.238 --> 11:31.108
<i>To avoid confusion,
it should be pointed out</i>

11:31.141 --> 11:33.610
<i>that in a bizarre twist,</i>

11:33.642 --> 11:36.546
<i>Deandra Reynolds refused to
be a part of this documentary</i>

11:36.580 --> 11:38.748
<i>unless we allowed her to play Maureen</i>

11:38.781 --> 11:39.782
<i>in the reenactment.</i>

11:41.763 --> 11:43.019
<i>And Dennis always made a big show</i>

11:43.052 --> 11:45.121
<i>of getting her with the spray bottle.</i>

11:45.155 --> 11:46.390
<i>You know, because cats hate water.</i>

11:48.992 --> 11:53.730
<i>So, you see,
Dennis totally saw Maureen that night.</i>

11:53.762 --> 11:55.264
<i>Charlie was there.</i>

11:55.297 --> 11:56.732
Why hasn't he spoken up?

11:56.766 --> 11:58.635
Probably because Dennis...

11:59.432 --> 12:00.937
intimidated him.

12:02.738 --> 12:05.742
Oh, I just thought it'd
be more dramatic if I...

12:05.775 --> 12:07.277
Oh, come on, come on. I didn't lie.

12:07.310 --> 12:09.880
I just left out some facts
that are insignificant.

12:09.912 --> 12:12.715
And-and intimidate Charlie?
Please. What am I gonna do?

12:12.748 --> 12:15.152
Call him on the phone and threaten him?

12:17.354 --> 12:19.323
No, I know.
But, I mean, if Mac's gonna do it,

12:19.355 --> 12:21.203
then, you know, I'm gonna do it.

14:43.300 --> 14:44.935
At this point in the interrogation,

14:45.541 --> 14:47.238
Christ, I was at a loss.

15:22.367 --> 15:24.903
<i>Further inspection
of Dennis Reynolds' safe</i>

15:24.937 --> 15:28.122
<i>revealed a cache
of suspicious items.</i>

15:28.975 --> 15:29.985
<i>Awesome.</i>

16:10.224 --> 16:12.385
<i>So while Mr. Kelly's statements</i>

16:12.418 --> 16:15.822
<i>were clearly unreliable and
would need to be thrown out,</i>

16:15.855 --> 16:18.224
<i>another breakthrough came:</i>

16:18.256 --> 16:20.318
<i>autopsy results came back from the lab.</i>

16:40.947 --> 16:42.916
Um...

17:11.855 --> 17:14.531
Look, is getting groomed
like a cat by your ex weird?

17:14.636 --> 17:16.115
Yep.

17:16.148 --> 17:17.449
Is it illegal?

17:18.063 --> 17:19.685
I wish.

17:19.718 --> 17:22.421
<i>The investigation was at a crossroads.</i>

17:22.454 --> 17:25.558
<i>Then another massive break.</i>

17:25.590 --> 17:27.761
<i>Dennis has an answer for everything.</i>

17:28.294 --> 17:30.156
Well, answer me this:

17:31.223 --> 17:32.573
Where's the collar?

17:34.444 --> 17:36.296
<i>Cats have collars.</i>

17:36.328 --> 17:37.797
Maureen's body

17:37.829 --> 17:40.232
<i>didn't have a collar on it.</i>

17:40.266 --> 17:42.235
<i>Killers keep trophies.</i>

17:42.268 --> 17:43.770
<i>Alls I'm saying,</i>

17:43.802 --> 17:47.239
find the collar, find the killer.

17:48.048 --> 17:51.577
<i>This is not the first time
the collar came up.</i>

17:51.610 --> 17:53.312
<i>Dee Reynolds had, oddly,</i>

17:53.346 --> 17:55.848
<i>made the collar an issue during filming.</i>

17:56.082 --> 17:57.124
Hey. Stop!

17:57.216 --> 17:59.619
Stop! Stop with the squirting!
Stop! Cool it!

17:59.653 --> 18:01.188
We said one spray and then my line.

18:02.689 --> 18:04.124
I... It was in my contract
that we talked...

18:04.156 --> 18:06.626
I put one squirt in there for...
on purpose.

18:06.660 --> 18:08.495
And this collar!
I... Th-There's something wrong

18:08.528 --> 18:10.607
with the collar. It's driving me nuts.

18:12.314 --> 18:14.768
It... is an actual flea collar?

18:15.530 --> 18:16.423
You son of a bitch.

18:16.592 --> 18:17.993
I-I really think the water activated

18:18.027 --> 18:20.664
some kind of, like, chemical agent.
My-my neck's burning.

18:21.259 --> 18:23.833
<i>Was the flea collar
actually burning her,</i>

18:23.867 --> 18:25.068
<i>as she claimed?</i>

18:25.100 --> 18:26.402
Are you serious?

18:26.435 --> 18:28.571
Yes, asshole! It was burning my skin!

18:28.605 --> 18:30.240
You want to zoom in on this?!

18:30.272 --> 18:31.675
<i>Hard to say.</i>

18:31.707 --> 18:34.844
<i>But maybe there was another
reason she removed it.</i>

18:34.877 --> 18:36.780
<i>Whatever Deandra says is BS.</i>

18:36.812 --> 18:39.014
She's probably just covering
for him because she's afraid

18:39.048 --> 18:40.750
he's gonna snap her neck like that crow.

18:42.784 --> 18:45.154
<i>Maybe Deandra
didn't want to wear the collar</i>

18:45.187 --> 18:47.122
<i>in order to cover for her brother</i>

18:47.156 --> 18:51.328
<i>and to establish that Maureen
never wore a collar at all.</i>

18:52.310 --> 18:55.331
<i>We then discovered something
in this piece of footage</i>

18:55.365 --> 18:59.435
<i>that blew the doors
wide open on this case.</i>

18:59.469 --> 19:01.705
Was I a person of interest?

19:01.738 --> 19:02.973
Yeah.

19:03.005 --> 19:04.874
I am an interesting person.

19:04.907 --> 19:06.976
But at the end of the day, you know,

19:07.010 --> 19:09.179
I'm just some guy with a crazy ex-wife

19:09.212 --> 19:12.549
who fell off of a roof
pretending to be a cat.

19:12.581 --> 19:13.983
That's the end of it.

19:14.017 --> 19:16.186
All my stories checked out.

19:16.219 --> 19:19.189
I was cleared. Case closed.

19:22.090 --> 19:24.927
<i>Find the collar, find the killer.</i>

19:25.060 --> 19:26.629
<i>Find the collar, find the killer.</i>

19:26.663 --> 19:27.998
<i>...'cause a dog is who I am now!</i>

19:28.031 --> 19:28.999
<i>...hit the referee!</i>

19:29.031 --> 19:30.367
<i>Find the collar...</i>

19:30.399 --> 19:32.368
<i>"Very nice."</i>

19:32.402 --> 19:35.038
<i>Find the collar, find the killer.</i>

19:45.048 --> 19:48.218
Guys, this was an open-and-shut
case that was shut months ago.

19:48.251 --> 19:50.987
And Maureen never wore a collar.
You guys put that there.

19:51.020 --> 19:53.256
Well, yeah,
we needed a big twist at the end

19:53.289 --> 19:54.758
to show that you're guilty.

19:54.790 --> 19:56.091
But I'm-I'm not guilty.

19:56.125 --> 19:57.928
What about the security
footage of Maureen's death?

19:57.961 --> 20:00.327
I mean, it shows her
prancing around on the roof

20:00.362 --> 20:02.460
like an asshole,
and then she just falls off.

20:02.495 --> 20:04.429
People don't want to see that,
because it's hard evidence,

20:04.430 --> 20:05.230
- you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

20:05.300 --> 20:07.237
Like, it's better to
actually sit on that footage

20:07.369 --> 20:09.271
until, like, maybe episode ten,
and then let people

20:09.304 --> 20:11.040
decide then if you're guilty or not.

20:11.073 --> 20:13.542
Ten episo...
You're gonna do ten episodes of this?

20:13.576 --> 20:15.745
Yeah, but then even then
we would keep it vague.

20:15.778 --> 20:17.414
I mean, 'cause that's entertainment,
you know?

20:17.446 --> 20:19.348
Someone gets murdered,
and then you make a show.

20:19.381 --> 20:20.916
But you never give any actual answers,

20:20.950 --> 20:22.619
- because that's what people love.
- No.

20:22.652 --> 20:25.455
You drag it out. You rake it
all over the victim's family.

20:25.488 --> 20:27.223
It's sort of like eating
a bag of chips, you know?

20:27.255 --> 20:29.059
It's never gonna actually make you full,

20:29.091 --> 20:30.259
and at the end you're sick,

20:30.292 --> 20:31.895
but you want to go back for more.

20:31.927 --> 20:33.530
You want more chips.

20:33.562 --> 20:34.964
- Murder is chips.
- Okay,

20:34.998 --> 20:37.067
you know what, I don't know
what you guys are talking about,

20:37.099 --> 20:38.734
but I'm gonna find these tapes,
and I'm gonna destroy them.

20:38.768 --> 20:39.800
Well, we have backups, so it...

20:39.801 --> 20:40.801
- Yeah.
- Oh, you know what?

20:40.837 --> 20:42.939
That could make a good episode,
where he's destroying...

20:42.972 --> 20:44.708
Let's think about that, right?
He's destroying the tapes...

20:44.741 --> 20:46.209
You know what,

20:46.242 --> 20:47.242
that would be

20:47.275 --> 20:48.611
"very nice."

20:49.979 --> 20:51.581
Is that Borat?

20:51.614 --> 20:52.882
Yes! See?

20:52.915 --> 20:54.984
He gets it. He's laughing.

20:55.018 --> 20:57.721
- Yeah, 'cause I know he was doing an impression.
- He's laughing.

20:57.753 --> 20:59.555
Okay, wait, uh, let me...
let me think of another one.

20:59.588 --> 21:01.758
Let me think of another one.
"I'll be back."

21:01.790 --> 21:03.993
Oh... Who is that?
Who is that?
