&lrm;[Chloe huffs] This is rubbish.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.480
&lrm;I don't have a thing to wear.

00:33.920 --> 00:35.360
&lrm;This one is way too pink,

00:35.520 --> 00:37.200
&lrm;those are so last season,

00:37.720 --> 00:41.200
&lrm;those ones didn't cost enough
&lrm;and these are never in season.

00:41.360 --> 00:42.640
&lrm;I hate all of these!

00:42.800 --> 00:43.960
&lrm;[smashing]

00:46.320 --> 00:47.880
&lrm;Is someone there?

&lrm;[humming]

00:49.440 --> 00:50.760
&lrm;Anybody?

&lrm;[cackling] Hey, wait!

01:04.959 --> 01:05.880
&lrm;Come back, shoes.

01:06.040 --> 01:09.120
&lrm;[sobbing] It's not true, I love you.

01:12.040 --> 01:13.160
&lrm;[sad sigh]

01:16.640 --> 01:18.080
&lrm;Look at Chloe.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.080
&lrm;[snoring]

01:23.320 --> 01:24.680
&lrm;That girl's a wreck.

01:24.840 --> 01:26.520
&lrm;Maybe she misses her BFF.

01:26.640 --> 01:29.280
&lrm;Sabrina has been absent
&lrm;since yesterday.

01:29.640 --> 01:30.520

01:34.640 --> 01:35.840
&lrm;What is it, Chloe?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.840
&lrm;Someone pulled my hair.

01:38.800 --> 01:40.160
&lrm;I didn't do it, Mrs M.

01:40.520 --> 01:41.560
&lrm;It wasn't her!

01:41.720 --> 01:45.000
&lrm;It's... it's some...
&lrm;invisible, mystical being,

01:45.160 --> 01:49.120
&lrm;like a leprechaun or a unicorn,
&lrm;without the horn.

01:49.280 --> 01:50.400
&lrm;[laughter]

01:50.560 --> 01:52.680
&lrm;Quiet, everyone. Eyes on your papers!

01:54.640 --> 01:56.640
&lrm;[gasping] It's happening again.

01:58.280 --> 01:59.600
&lrm;Chloe, sit down.

01:59.760 --> 02:02.320
&lrm;I can't. My purse is beating me up.

02:14.240 --> 02:16.440
&lrm;Chloe, don't run in the classroom!

02:17.040 --> 02:18.400
&lrm;Get back to your seat.

02:25.720 --> 02:27.520
&lrm;Compose yourself, Miss Bourgois.

02:27.680 --> 02:29.520
&lrm;[laughter]
&lrm;[Chloe screams]

02:33.720 --> 02:35.360
&lrm;[whispering]
&lrm;We've gotta get outta here.

02:35.520 --> 02:37.880
&lrm;Miss, I have to go to the restroom.

02:38.040 --> 02:39.120
&lrm;Thank you.

02:39.280 --> 02:40.400
&lrm;So do I, please.

02:41.040 --> 02:41.920
&lrm;[she gasps]

02:43.960 --> 02:46.280
&lrm;Somebody seems to have it in for Chloe.

02:46.440 --> 02:48.800
&lrm;The hard part is finding out who doesn't.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.560

&lrm;Something strange is going on.

&lrm;Time to transform!

03:01.400 --> 03:03.120
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

03:17.840 --> 03:19.680
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

03:34.400 --> 03:36.840
&lrm;Damaging my daughter's reputation is like

03:37.000 --> 03:40.600
<i>&lrm;soiling the reputation of</i>
<i>&lrm;the Mayor of Paris, which is me.</i>

03:40.760 --> 03:43.280
&lrm;An attack on Chloe is an attack on Paris.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.840
&lrm;We'll find the culprit, you have my word.

03:48.600 --> 03:51.200
&lrm;Chloe, my darling,
&lrm;we've got special guests.

03:51.360 --> 03:52.360
&lrm;[excited] Ladybug!

03:53.120 --> 03:56.440
&lrm;I knew you'd save me,
&lrm;considering we're good friends.

03:56.840 --> 03:58.680
&lrm;[Mayor] I had to make an emergency call

03:58.840 --> 04:00.200
&lrm;to all the big designers.

04:00.360 --> 04:03.720
&lrm;Can you imagine my daughter
&lrm;wearing department-store clothing?

04:03.880 --> 04:04.960
&lrm;How humiliating!

04:05.120 --> 04:07.360
&lrm;[camera clicks]
&lrm;[frustrated groan]

04:09.800 --> 04:11.760
&lrm;Have you had any run-ins
&lrm;with anyone lately?

04:11.920 --> 04:14.040
&lrm;I never have run-ins with anyone.

04:14.200 --> 04:15.680
&lrm;Everybody loves me.

04:17.320 --> 04:18.600
&lrm;Really?

04:19.560 --> 04:21.680
&lrm;Not even with your closest friends?

04:21.839 --> 04:22.760
&lrm;Sabrina?

04:22.920 --> 04:24.160
&lrm;[puffing] Impossible.

04:24.320 --> 04:25.880
&lrm;She adores me. I'm her idol.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.800
&lrm;She's safe here with the doors locked.

04:29.960 --> 04:32.720
&lrm;This enemy may be invisible
&lrm;but it can't go through walls.

04:32.880 --> 04:35.000
&lrm;I'm sure you'll make
&lrm;my life perfect again,

04:35.160 --> 04:36.440
&lrm;like it was before.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.320
&lrm;Is something up?

04:46.480 --> 04:47.920
&lrm;She's hiding something.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.440
&lrm;Whatever you tell us stays in this room.

04:51.920 --> 04:53.760
&lrm;She did have a run-in with someone.

04:54.040 --> 04:55.800
&lrm;[lift beeps] Miss Chloe and Sabrina

04:55.960 --> 04:58.520
&lrm;like to impersonate Ladybug and Cat Noir.

04:58.680 --> 05:01.960
&lrm;I was playing the part
&lrm;of Big Mustachio that day.

05:02.360 --> 05:03.720
&lrm;Big Mustachio?

05:03.840 --> 05:05.360
&lrm;One of Chloe's ideas.

05:05.520 --> 05:09.240
&lrm;Big Mustachio wants all Parisians
&lrm;to have heinous moustaches.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.960
&lrm;What a hairy situation?

05:12.680 --> 05:14.640
&lrm;Please, go on.

05:14.800 --> 05:17.120
&lrm;[Mrs Chamack] Thank you for this interview

05:17.280 --> 05:19.120
&lrm;about your new album, Mr Stone.

05:19.280 --> 05:20.680
&lrm;Can you tell us how...

05:27.960 --> 05:29.040
&lrm;Jagged Stone?

05:29.200 --> 05:30.200
&lrm;Ladybug,

05:30.360 --> 05:32.160
&lrm;what are you doing here?

05:32.320 --> 05:33.880
&lrm;When I heard you were here,

05:34.440 --> 05:36.840
&lrm;I knew you'd want to see me.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.720
&lrm;I had to come say hello.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.400
&lrm;Well, you did right.

05:40.560 --> 05:42.720
&lrm;What's the deal with your hair?

05:46.080 --> 05:49.840
<i>&lrm;I... the old hair was so drab.</i>

05:50.000 --> 05:51.640
<i>&lrm;This colour is amazing.</i>

05:51.800 --> 05:53.040
<i>&lrm;Don't you think?</i>

05:53.200 --> 05:55.120
<i>&lrm;I've got a few minutes to spare.</i>

05:55.280 --> 05:57.680
<i>&lrm;I'm sure you'd jump at the chance</i>
<i>&lrm;to interview me?</i>

05:57.840 --> 06:00.640
<i>&lrm;Hey, wait.</i>
<i>&lrm;I thought you here to say hi to me.</i>

06:00.800 --> 06:01.800
<i>&lrm;And I did.</i>

06:01.960 --> 06:03.600
<i>&lrm;Now, where were we?</i>

06:04.440 --> 06:06.640
&lrm;She pretended she was me?

06:06.800 --> 06:08.400
&lrm;How often does that happen?

06:08.760 --> 06:10.120
&lrm;She idolises you.

06:10.560 --> 06:12.800
&lrm;Chloe, I've found Big Mustachio.

06:12.960 --> 06:14.400
<i>&lrm;Chloe? But...</i>

06:14.560 --> 06:16.880
<i>&lrm;You're not Ladybug. You're a fake!</i>

06:17.040 --> 06:19.440
<i>&lrm;[Chloe huffs] No, I'm not.</i>

06:19.600 --> 06:21.280
<i>&lrm;I'm Ladybug, look.</i>

06:37.920 --> 06:39.880
&lrm;[Chloe huffs] But, Chloe...

06:40.040 --> 06:41.880
&lrm;How was I supposed to know?

06:42.440 --> 06:43.680
&lrm;That's the problem!

06:43.840 --> 06:45.440
&lrm;You never know anything!

06:45.600 --> 06:48.200
&lrm;That crocodile
&lrm;has a larger brain than you!

06:48.680 --> 06:51.480
&lrm;Get out!
&lrm;I never want to see you again.

06:53.920 --> 06:57.160
&lrm;Mademoiselle does argue
&lrm;with her friend Sabrina at times.

06:57.320 --> 06:59.520
<i>&lrm;I'd say that it's...</i>

06:59.680 --> 07:02.720
<i>&lrm;"the norm",</i>
<i>&lrm;but it was different this time.</i>

07:02.880 --> 07:04.920
<i>&lrm;Sabrina came back the next day.</i>

07:05.680 --> 07:06.720
&lrm;Sabrina who?

07:06.880 --> 07:08.280
&lrm;I don't know any Sabrina.

07:08.720 --> 07:11.760
&lrm;But of course you do, Chloe, it's me...

07:12.360 --> 07:13.640
&lrm;your BFF.

07:15.560 --> 07:18.000
&lrm;You should talk to her. She's right here.

07:20.480 --> 07:21.920
&lrm;I don't see anyone.

07:22.080 --> 07:23.960
&lrm;She must be invisible.

07:24.120 --> 07:27.160
&lrm;As far as I'm concerned
&lrm;she doesn't even exist.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.040
&lrm;This invisible person,

07:36.200 --> 07:37.240
<i>&lrm;it's Sabrina.</i>

07:37.400 --> 07:39.480
<i>&lrm;Who's been akumatised by Hawk Moth.</i>

07:39.760 --> 07:42.840
&lrm;Impossible. She's too weak
&lrm;to do something so bold,

07:43.000 --> 07:44.440
&lrm;especially to me.

07:44.600 --> 07:45.680
&lrm;You're wrong.

07:48.040 --> 07:50.720
&lrm;You've been a great help to us. Thanks.

07:53.200 --> 07:55.560
&lrm;It won't be easy
&lrm;to find someone we can't see.

07:55.720 --> 07:58.080
&lrm;We'll just have to wait
&lrm;for her to find us.

07:58.240 --> 08:01.960
&lrm;And we have an advantage.
&lrm;She doesn't know we're onto her.

08:03.760 --> 08:06.240
&lrm;And now I do, Ladybug.

08:06.400 --> 08:09.000
&lrm;It's time to fulfil
&lrm;our agreement, Vanisher.

08:09.160 --> 08:11.240
&lrm;Cat Noir and Ladybug are at your mercy.

08:11.400 --> 08:13.720
&lrm;Take their Miraculouses
&lrm;and bring them to me!

08:15.040 --> 08:17.960
&lrm;They'll never see me coming, Hawk Moth.

08:22.080 --> 08:24.240
&lrm;The flower... it...

08:24.640 --> 08:26.400
&lrm;[gust of wind]

08:26.560 --> 08:28.440
&lrm;Look out, Ladybug!

08:31.240 --> 08:33.400
&lrm;If it really is you, Sabrina,

08:33.559 --> 08:35.799
&lrm;then I'll be the one to take you down.

08:37.400 --> 08:39.400
&lrm;You didn't get my costume.

08:39.559 --> 08:41.159
&lrm;Now, you'll have to face me.

08:48.640 --> 08:50.480
&lrm;Lucky charm!

08:56.440 --> 08:57.280
&lrm;How handy.

08:57.440 --> 08:58.840
&lrm;Looking for me Sabrina?

08:59.000 --> 09:00.760
&lrm;I'm right here. Come on!

09:00.920 --> 09:03.440
&lrm;Oh no, seriously? You need to leave!

09:03.600 --> 09:06.080
&lrm;If you stop this ridiculousness right now,

09:06.240 --> 09:08.200
&lrm;I might let you be my BFF again.

09:08.360 --> 09:10.640
&lrm;[Vanisher]
&lrm;You've got no friends left, Chloe.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.320
&lrm;And you'll never have any ever again!

09:13.480 --> 09:15.320
&lrm;I'll make sure of that.

09:15.480 --> 09:17.920
&lrm;You don't scare me. Everybody loves me.

09:18.080 --> 09:19.520
&lrm;This isn't a game, Chloe.

09:20.920 --> 09:23.640
&lrm;[Ladybug squeals] It's over, Ladybug.

09:23.800 --> 09:25.720
&lrm;Not yet, Vanisher.

09:33.320 --> 09:37.640
&lrm;Just because you see me,
&lrm;doesn't mean you'll defeat me.

09:40.840 --> 09:42.760
&lrm;Look who's come to the rescue.

09:43.840 --> 09:45.520
&lrm;You stay here, don't move!

09:45.680 --> 09:48.360
&lrm;Hey! This concerns me too, you know.

09:51.520 --> 09:53.520
&lrm;Her Akuma's in her bag.

09:54.640 --> 09:58.800
&lrm;Wait, Ladybug,
&lrm;I don't think that's where it is.

10:00.280 --> 10:02.880
&lrm;So you wanna fight after all, Chloe?

10:03.040 --> 10:05.800
&lrm;-Can you handle this?
&lrm;-With pleasure, Milady.

10:10.800 --> 10:13.440
&lrm;Wait! The Akuma must be
&lrm;in the designer pin I got her.

10:13.600 --> 10:16.520
&lrm;It's on her sweater, such an ugly sweater.

10:16.680 --> 10:18.000
&lrm;It was a gift from me.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.960
&lrm;I won't tell you again.

10:20.120 --> 10:23.480
&lrm;You need to leave.
&lrm;You're putting us all in danger.

10:23.640 --> 10:24.840
&lrm;Got it?

10:25.000 --> 10:27.680
&lrm;Why aren't you listening? It's in her pin.

10:28.200 --> 10:29.400
&lrm;That's better.

10:39.480 --> 10:41.160
&lrm;Your days are over, Akuma.

10:42.800 --> 10:44.680
&lrm;[growling]

10:47.960 --> 10:49.440
&lrm;[cracking]

10:50.720 --> 10:51.760
&lrm;I knew it.

10:51.920 --> 10:53.960
&lrm;So, who was right then?

10:54.120 --> 10:56.320
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, little Akuma.

11:00.280 --> 11:02.280
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

11:05.520 --> 11:06.520
&lrm;Gotcha!

11:07.800 --> 11:09.560
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

11:10.400 --> 11:11.880
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

11:17.240 --> 11:19.640
&lrm;Inconceivable! I was so close!

11:20.480 --> 11:21.840
&lrm;[he roars]

11:26.840 --> 11:28.640
&lrm;What happened?

11:28.800 --> 11:30.560
&lrm;What am I doing here?

11:30.720 --> 11:33.640
&lrm;Oh no, it's the brooch Chloe gave me.

11:34.320 --> 11:37.440
&lrm;Why didn't you listen to Chloe?
&lrm;She was trying to help.

11:37.600 --> 11:42.080
&lrm;First, because she put us in danger,
&lrm;and second, she lied to us earlier.

11:42.240 --> 11:44.240
<i>&lrm;I won't listen to a liar.</i>

11:44.400 --> 11:46.960
&lrm;You're calling me a liar?

11:47.120 --> 11:48.280
&lrm;How dare you!

11:48.440 --> 11:50.680
&lrm;I was your hugest fan but not anymore.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.560
&lrm;You don't deserve my devotion!

11:53.680 --> 11:54.960
<i>&lrm;We're live.</i>

11:55.080 --> 11:57.200
<i>&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir</i>

<i>&lrm;Ladybug,</i>

11:59.880 --> 12:01.440
<i>&lrm;Is it true you two are very close?</i>

12:01.600 --> 12:03.440
&lrm;I'm through with you, Ladybug!

12:04.840 --> 12:07.240
&lrm;A betrayed Ladybug worshipper...

12:07.400 --> 12:11.040
&lrm;Just what I need to recover
&lrm;from the defeat of Vanisher.

12:11.200 --> 12:14.120
&lrm;This... is... perfect.

12:21.000 --> 12:25.120
&lrm;Fly away, my little Akuma,
&lrm;and evilise her!

12:34.760 --> 12:37.520
&lrm;[she sobs]

12:40.400 --> 12:42.840
&lrm;Antibug, I am Hawk Moth.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.600
&lrm;Ladybug has let you down.

12:44.760 --> 12:46.520
&lrm;I want her downfall, too.

12:46.680 --> 12:49.120
&lrm;So, shall we defeat Ladybug together?

12:49.840 --> 12:51.680
&lrm;You can count on me, Hawk Moth.

12:51.840 --> 12:54.280
&lrm;There will only be one heroine in Paris,

12:54.440 --> 12:56.280
&lrm;me, Antibug!

12:56.440 --> 12:58.760

12:58.920 --> 13:00.240
&lrm;[Chloe blows a kiss]

13:00.400 --> 13:02.360
&lrm;Your time is up, Ladybug.

13:04.880 --> 13:06.160
&lrm;[bleeping]

13:06.320 --> 13:09.160
&lrm;Excuse me, I've gotta go. Bug out.

13:09.720 --> 13:10.800
&lrm;Thank you, Ladybug.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.240
&lrm;[cackling]

13:15.360 --> 13:18.880
&lrm;If it weren't for me,
&lrm;you wouldn't have defeated Vanisher.

13:19.040 --> 13:21.400
&lrm;And now, I'm going to defeat you!

13:21.560 --> 13:22.520
&lrm;Chloe?

13:23.000 --> 13:24.320
&lrm;Wrong, super-wrong.

13:24.640 --> 13:26.240
&lrm;I am Antibug.

13:26.560 --> 13:29.280
&lrm;We've got an emergency.
&lrm;I'm about to change back.

13:29.440 --> 13:30.800
&lrm;Go, I can take care of her.

13:30.960 --> 13:33.960
&lrm;Look at that.
&lrm;She's nothing without Cat Noir.

13:34.120 --> 13:36.320
&lrm;We'll meet again soon, trust me.

13:36.480 --> 13:38.160
&lrm;It's just you and me, Antibug!

13:39.080 --> 13:40.640
&lrm;I love a good cat fight.

13:49.160 --> 13:50.200
&lrm;[bleeping]

13:54.360 --> 13:56.400
&lrm;I don't have any food for you, Tikki.

13:56.560 --> 13:58.640
&lrm;Don't worry, Marinette.
&lrm;You'll find something.

13:58.800 --> 14:00.160
&lrm;I'll try.

14:00.320 --> 14:01.360
<i>&lrm;Ladybug has disappeared.</i>

14:01.560 --> 14:03.440
<i>&lrm;How will Cat Noir get out of this alone?</i>

14:03.720 --> 14:05.120
&lrm;This is all my fault.

14:05.280 --> 14:07.280
&lrm;You don't have to do everything yourself.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.440
&lrm;There's no harm in listening to others.

14:09.600 --> 14:10.440
&lrm;You're right,

14:10.600 --> 14:12.880
&lrm;but first we have to help Cat Noir.

14:13.040 --> 14:14.680
&lrm;We'll find some food at the hotel.

14:14.960 --> 14:15.880
&lrm;[radio crackles]

14:16.040 --> 14:17.080
&lrm;OK... OK...

&lrm;[Antibug giggles]

14:38.120 --> 14:40.720
&lrm;-Hurry up, Tikki.
&lrm;-I'm eating as fast as I can.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.360
&lrm;Aren't you tired
&lrm;of playing second fiddle to Ladybug?

14:44.520 --> 14:46.480
&lrm;And aren't you tired of copying Ladybug?

14:47.560 --> 14:50.680
&lrm;Keep it up, Antibug.
&lrm;Cat Noir is the perfect bait.

14:51.840 --> 14:53.480
&lrm;Team up with me, Cat Noir.

14:53.640 --> 14:57.000
&lrm;Never! Not with a fake like you.
&lrm;Ladybug and I are a team.

14:57.160 --> 14:59.120
&lrm;Let's hope she shows up soon.

14:59.280 --> 15:01.680
&lrm;[whimpering]

15:02.600 --> 15:05.840
&lrm;I know you can hear me, Ladybrat,
&lrm;wherever you are.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.920
&lrm;If you want to keep Cat Noir alive,

15:09.080 --> 15:10.960
&lrm;give me your Miraculous.

15:11.400 --> 15:12.640
&lrm;And if you refuse,

15:12.800 --> 15:14.800
&lrm;take a good look at Cat Noir,

15:14.960 --> 15:17.320
&lrm;because this will be the last
&lrm;time you see him.

15:17.480 --> 15:19.280
&lrm;I'm going to count to ten.

15:19.440 --> 15:20.480
&lrm;One...

15:20.640 --> 15:22.280
&lrm;Can you make it 20?

15:22.440 --> 15:23.440
&lrm;[Chloe] Two...

15:23.600 --> 15:25.840
&lrm;I need more time.
&lrm;Go save Cat Noir.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.640
&lrm;But I can't transform.

15:27.800 --> 15:30.720
&lrm;You are Ladybug,
&lrm;with or without the costume.

15:30.880 --> 15:32.280
&lrm;I think I'd know if I was able to...

15:32.440 --> 15:33.280
&lrm;Three...

15:34.160 --> 15:35.760
&lrm;I'm giving you advice.

15:35.920 --> 15:38.640
&lrm;Now take it,
&lrm;don't make the same mistake twice.

15:39.200 --> 15:40.240
&lrm;Got an idea.

16:14.200 --> 16:16.160
&lrm;Show yourself, bug-face.

16:19.240 --> 16:20.800
&lrm;Ready for round 2?

16:24.600 --> 16:25.520
&lrm;It worked!

&lrm;-I'm fit to go, Marinette.
&lrm;-Yes!

&lrm;Sorry, I don't take orders
&lrm;from a mere copycat.

&lrm;Nice yoyo. Mine's better.

17:01.800 --> 17:02.760
&lrm;What kept you?

17:02.920 --> 17:04.319
&lrm;I think the Akuma's in the yoyo.

17:04.480 --> 17:06.520
&lrm;-I think it's in her earrings.
&lrm;-Why?

17:06.680 --> 17:08.560
&lrm;She was wearing them
&lrm;when she was akumatised,

17:08.720 --> 17:10.319
&lrm;and her yoyo was destroyed.

17:10.480 --> 17:12.160
&lrm;Pretty good advice...
